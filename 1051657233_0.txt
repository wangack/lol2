[1:35:22] TheOreoCupcake: @lilnatcha SMLZ gapped "Best Team in LPL" KEKW
[1:35:32] get_updownleftright: RNG finished first both regular split and playoffs, while convincingly beating FPX in finals. They are clearly the best team going into this split

[1:35:42] anastaq12: 360 worst top lane for top 8 team

[1:38:36] MetaSlave_: @anastaq12 I'm curious whether you are trolling or you really only have 2 braincells
[1:38:38] lunarwolffff: any mid laner can play adc like loken, ghost etc..but that's not real mechanical carry play
[1:38:38] jacquoz: Samd is overrated af. he can't carry this team. he looked ok on V5 but ever since he's looked bad
[1:38:53] TheOreoCupcake: @baneviper I said FF and a number. It said "Reference to Appearance"

[1:41:13] TheOreoCupcake: @anastaq12 Ming and Gala has looked way better than LWX and Crisp lately. Ming was the best player at MSI by a longshot.
[1:41:19] Wilkohn: DK lost Nuguri and still got second I think they’ll be fine if Beryl and Ghost shape up their play
[1:41:25] blackbeam: @TheOreoCupcake weird take, they were 4-3 over 2 series 🤔

[1:42:10] MansoGanzo: @Wilkohn if meta shifts away from hypercarries they're fine, as long as ghost can play weakside they win
[1:42:12] Makmix_: DK Khan too coin flippy as a top laner, he'll either solo win or solo lose the game
[1:42:13] grumpy_dwarte: @Munchables I know, thank you though :)
[1:42:16] Comprandre: @heistaken ye but for this it means jungle meta needs to shift from full clear powerfarm to early aggression and pressure, and sadly idk if riot is planing this

[1:45:18] captainkrajick: @baneviper 2 years ago definitely. Have you seen how good he got at laning from 2020 to spring?
[1:45:18] MansoGanzo: @MHoudini yes he can only play roaming mids. Showmaker can do that too but he doesnt suck in lane :)
[1:45:25] hsuchihmo: Shadow will play in the next series
[1:45:26] pieeck: lets end it before 28 min guys

[1:45:47] Munchables: @entengski italian/chinese i believe, not 100% sure
[1:45:50] MansoGanzo: @NaIsGigaTrash DK Chovy roleswapping top would be a giga move and make the team stupidly strong
[1:45:50] fazed343: @fazed343 ya it sucks but believe me when its off its way  worse
[1:45:51] bluestorm1998: Chinese Italian

[1:45:58] Comprandre: I think the Kkoma effect will pay off in worlds, nobody's talking about this new member that came after worlds, Kkoma is the real carry of the teams he works in !
[1:45:58] ziosevielspezel: @captainkrajick  ya he improved but he was still good back then

[1:46:49] captainkrajick: @baneviper And nemesis was talking about lane specifically which he definitely was horrendous at until this year
[1:46:53] ziosevielspezel: @captainkrajick  his laning sucked but it doesnt mean he is a bad midlaner
[1:46:56] babeimoutofhere: jdg gg
[1:46:57] blackbeam: @blackbeam relative to other roles, i don't think there's a single role where lpl on a whole is weaker than any other region tbh
[1:47:01] hsuchihmo: just end BibleThump
[1:47:02] Latchu2000: beryl many times int sometimes god but generally the bot lane is not a strong point there lol

[1:48:19] Comprandre: the bo3 in split is such a good format idk why its not in western scene anymore, i'm sure teams would improve a lot from it
[1:48:21] pieeck: ZOOM iwdL <3
[1:48:26] anastaq12: @TheOreoCupcake and everyone last years suddenly began to praised berly its so cring
[1:48:29] jdg1776: that was sexual assault someone call the police
[1:48:40] anastaq12: Even Vsta better than berly in his first split
[1:48:41] theomgfather: lol ^
[1:48:59] TheOreoCupcake: @anastaq12 Following Canyon like a puppy made people think he's good. Ghost and Beryl rarely won lane.
[1:49:08] captainkrajick: @jdg1776 Who touched my TT PepeHands
[1:49:13] kenguin35: beryl was good last year him being absolute trash during msi doesnt take away his level of play last year
[1:49:14] hemanlikestowatch: ratirlLove
[1:49:18] anastaq12: @Comprandre cuz they have only 4 team can actually worth to play in bo3
[1:49:19] MansoGanzo: @lilnatcha none of those are better than showmaker and chovy, rookie is currently better than faker yes. bests mids are in LCK
[1:49:27] bbrrosseeantt: @theoreocupcake Ming and Meiko are best roamer this year imo KomodoHype
[1:49:29] noheart4z: ez prediction
[1:49:39] hsuchihmo: showmaker KEKW
[1:49:40] captainkrajick: @MansoGanzo Rookie isn't that good. Scout is better
[1:49:40] ziosevielspezel: lpl doesnt have good midlaners ???? wtf u talking bro
[1:49:41] lunarwolffff: Loken doesn't do anything, still finishes 6-0 because of Zoom and Kavani KEKW
[1:49:48] namibi: shitty take
[1:49:50] bbrrosseeantt: @mansoganzo best mid still gapped by cryin LUL
[1:49:57] anastaq12: @TheOreoCupcake Ghost was so cringe in msi he was 1v5ed from gala
[1:50:04] TheOreoCupcake: @lilnatcha Absolutely. I still feel amazed over his Nautilus play at MSI when he saved Cryin from Nocturne Ult.
[1:50:06] jamespac123: @lilnatcha just 2 players and ruler are good in lck KEKW
[1:50:08] babeimoutofhere: kanavi nice
[1:50:11] MansoGanzo: @lilnatcha 2020 worlds LUL
[1:50:11] blackbeam: @blackbeam rookie, scout, knight, doinb, fofo, angel, shanks, etc etc. the argument is about depth and not just peak.
[1:50:12] QuasarTec: 2155 to 22108 kekw
[1:50:12] gamja331a: 2155
[1:50:15] liangzhu: @lilnatcha showmaker the guy who lost 3/5 games to cryin at msi?
[1:50:18] hsuchihmo: shoemaker played 7 game against Cryin and lost 5 games and performed so bad KEKW LCK fan boys KEKW
[1:50:18] jdg1776: kanavi did 10x the damage of xiaopeng omg
[1:50:20] anastaq12: Jdg really have to change mid and adc
[1:50:20] kenguin35: saying beryl is bad now and linking that to say he was never good is results based anaylsis akin to new esports fan saying faker was always trash since he hasnt been to worlds for 2 years
[1:50:23] Comprandre: @anastaq12 yes for now, at the begining it might be one sided but overall i think it would up the average level of the region on the long term
[1:50:23] TheOreoCupcake: @anastaq12 Kai'sa Malphite Ultimate Cosplay LUL

[1:50:35] theomgfather: lmfao 2155
[1:50:39] l3vi1: Rookie is still cracked and in laning phase is one of the best if not the best
[1:50:40] sobersoap18: @lilnatcha we cant really say until worlds, Cryin gapped SM in three games in MSI finals... And watching SM and Chovy play just make me realize how bad the rest of their team and LCK is lol
[1:50:47] babeimoutofhere: top jg dif
[1:50:49] bbrrosseeantt: @liangzhu yep

[1:50:57] Dieghoull: Viper > Ruler
[1:51:00] god8256: garbage team TT
[1:51:02] MansoGanzo: @lilnatcha same was said last year, huge COPIUM
[1:51:10] blackbeam: okay as if showmaker wasn't trying to drag beryl's corpse over the finish line the entire msi.
[1:51:15] TheOreoCupcake: @god8256 TT stands for Trash Team.
[1:51:18] bbrrosseeantt: @sobersoap18 Showmaker got FAKER treatment LUL
[1:51:29] hsuchihmo: Shoemaker jayce/syndra game was just so bad KEKW
[1:51:39] captainkrajick: @sobersoap18 Ah yes RNG won 3 games, therefore Cryin gapped Showmaker 3 times, let's ignore the other 2 games

[1:53:57] TheOreoCupcake: @anastaq12 SwordArt dragged Suning from Dark Horse to worlds final. Showmaker, Canyon and Nuguri did it for DK. Beryl  and Ghostwas the deadweight.

[1:55:16] pieeck: CatJAM
[1:55:16] sobersoap18: @grandezelx his Lucian saved RNG by flash killing Morgana, then he saved RNG AGANE by flash eq with Ryze into Baron pit 4v5, if it wasnt for Cryin, DK wouldve won
[1:55:18] ziosevielspezel: now that we see DK without nugiri do you guys think nugiri got overshadowed by canyon???
[1:55:19] hsuchihmo: only keria is better than beryl in LCK but DK have no chance to get keria
[1:55:22] captainkrajick: @anastaq12 Who's 3rd?
[1:55:29] grandezelx: showmaker was never the best in lane and cryn literally played every game to nutralise and he cant move to kill cause ming will roam mid and insta die cause bot posing hard
