He failed to impress so was offered a sideline spot, hence I said he was "kicked". Then he flew back to EU. that was all I meant. I have been follwing EDG since 2014 and there was a lot of hype around him that time.

[4:40:42] Jesus_ls_Here: @TheOreoCupcake doesn't mean we don't have a general idea on the player's overall level, no? if theshy comes back and ints again do we say hey it's just 2 games he we can't judge based on 2 games? lmao
[4:41:01] bookofexodus: Break through point for other teams
[4:41:22] TheOreoCupcake: @PopeFrancisOfficiaI Bad to judge someone on 2 games. That's why I don't even say Qingtian is bad after an abyssmal series against JDG.
[4:41:30] bookofexodus: It’s just tt today. What about teams like FPX
[4:41:36] l3vi1: @PopeFrancisOfficiaI TheShy is a special case LUL
[4:41:58] TheOreoCupcake: @bookofexodus Instead of worrying about what happens against FPX, why don't you just wait and watch it?
[4:42:02] LmaoLp: 6700 gold difference POGGERS
[4:42:21] Jesus_ls_Here: @TheOreoCupcake I think this is Qingtian's first split in LPLl it's understandable if you say that but with older players i feel like it's fair to have a previous opinion on them based on their years in competition
[4:42:46] Jesus_ls_Here: it can change, but generally you know where the player is at
[4:42:49] bookofexodus: we’ll see how mole play in the future
[4:42:55] TheOreoCupcake: @PopeFrancisOfficiaI I'm sorry you don't understand the hype around Mole but whatever, I'm not gonna waste time trying to explain it to you.
[4:43:05] TheOreoCupcake: @bookofexodus Finally, something smart from you.
[4:43:46] Jesus_ls_Here: you're the one who doesn't understand what i'm saying, I agree that mole is a great midlaner, i just don't know about the 2 games in so we can't judge @TheOreoCupcake
[4:43:57] M012345678: Mods end the prediction please jessieL
[4:44:02] LmaoLp: 🍊
[4:44:02] Jesus_ls_Here: matter of fact even based on previous splits mole has been an outstanding midlaner
