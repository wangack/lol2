[0:38:05] jakubbw: why is everyone putting fpx first when rng won msi and last season??
[0:38:06] BudzTG: in around 7 minutes according to chat
[0:38:53] Gericc22: because tian only came on later in the split
[0:38:57] lentibear: bc china has too many strong teams LUL
[0:38:57] BudzTG: cause nuguri and doinb
[0:39:18] SJWrId: because nuguri is nuguri
[0:39:19] jakubbw: but they were last season as well
[0:39:20] grandezelx: rng barely won msi and fpx had a really bad day
[0:39:24] jakubbw: split*
[0:39:43] jakubbw: but RNG looked superb at the MSI

[0:40:11] goblinguy01: RNG ez 2
[0:40:22] SJWrId: Nuguri was 1v5 in the finals tbh xD
[0:40:26] BudzTG: Lwx did look really bad
[0:40:27] Gericc22: Either way EDG RNG and FPX are favorites for this split. 4th place maybe TES or JDG but its open
[0:40:42] jakubbw: didnt nuguri ran it down with jayce?
[0:40:46] goblinguy01: IG is full COPIUM
[0:40:55] grandezelx: the thing is rng performed up to expectation while both bot for dwg and fpx ran it down

[0:43:59] SJWrId: Its insane how much stronger LPL as a region is compared to LCK.
[0:44:39] Flyingabove: Tai wan Ren shi wang ha Dan
[0:44:39] lentibear: LCK won last year...
[0:45:05] BudzTG: yeah i dont see them winning this year

[0:45:36] BudzTG: LULW
[0:45:41] SJWrId: DK are far weaker, and around 5 LPL teams are capable of winning Worlds, whereas probably only two can possibly win in LCK
[0:45:46] grandezelx: they said dw cant win
[0:45:52] lentibear: scripted
[0:45:54] grandezelx: lpl too strong
[0:46:03] ÊæÄÊæÄÊØçËééÂ•àÊúµ: KEKW
[0:46:05] grandezelx: like did you msc
[0:46:06] xiaotiangou: Lck is just DWG whereas Lpl theres alot more strong teams
[0:46:11] SynbiosX: LCS wins worlds this year
[0:46:25] Gericc22: nobody said DK can't win. Top 3 coming into last year's worlds were TES,JDG,DWG in no order
[0:46:29] grandezelx: then dwg just curb stomp world last year
[0:46:39] enzadeninothefirst: @SJWrId didnt gen g get 3-0 in quarter finals and then they keep the same roster?
[0:46:43] BudzTG: Fudge factor gonna gap nuguri at worlds COPIUM
[0:46:44] grandezelx: yah they were below
[0:46:56] grandezelx: both top and jdg
[0:46:59] SJWrId: DWG were the outright favourites last year. No surprise they won
[0:47:10] Flyingabove: Dk can‚Äôt win cause they full of tai wan Wang ba Dan
[0:47:14] grandezelx: they were not
[0:47:15] SJWrId: @enzadeninothefirst correct.
[0:47:18] Gericc22: Ok nevermind I'll stop arguing with the LCK fanboy. I already said IN NO ORDER
[0:47:32] xiaotiangou: Favourites was Tes
[0:47:37] xiaotiangou: and jdg
[0:47:42] SJWrId: DWG were 100% the favourites lmao
[0:47:49] grandezelx: unless you say it was according to scrims
[0:47:54] moretto55: COMECA NUNCA POHA?
[0:47:57] BudzTG: LCK will win worlds COPIUM
[0:47:58] grandezelx: dwg were not
[0:48:00] rosabud4: lpl had soe favorites but everyone saiddk was like best team
[0:48:02] enzadeninothefirst: doesnt really seem like geng win worlds
[0:48:27] amanddix: oxe
[0:48:27] grandezelx: dwg literally lost no scrims to lpl teams last year
[0:48:37] grandezelx: but before scrim results
[0:48:45] Gericc22: chat just stop arguing with the guy. he just doesn't want to accept the fact that DWG was also a favorite last year
[0:48:46] grandezelx: lpl were favourites
[0:49:01] lentibear: why has tes been underperforming...
[0:49:03] grandezelx: they were not go watch

[0:49:44] xiaotiangou: but tes was what everyone said was gonna win worlds lmao
[0:49:51] grandezelx: not confident they hoped they can do well
[0:50:05] SJWrId: @grandezelx no they weren't. Damwon literally had just matched 2015 SKT's split record, and had some ridiculous match win streak. They were like 24-1 on blue side...
[0:50:07] grandezelx: tes were favourites till groups

[0:52:14] grandezelx: they said lck was the worse that rime
[0:52:25] grandezelx: it has ever been
[0:52:49] BudzTG: Lck was incredibly top heavy
[0:52:56] charvos1: ppl rlly like to exaggerate in this chat
[0:53:00] BudzTG: and still is with a much weaker damwon
[0:53:07] Trapzinha: who Will Win?
[0:53:11] charvos1: damwons botlane has played bad but the rest of the team is playing incredibly well
[0:53:29] playboi_stummy: Nice England jersey
[0:53:29] charvos1: if u watched the series between damwon and kt then youd see that the lck is still really good
[0:53:40] charvos1: the lpl is good though as well, but its all speculation till worlds
[0:53:46] grandezelx: they are getting destroyed by every bot
[0:53:53] grandezelx: even in lck
[0:54:06] grandezelx: beryl and ghost are running it
[0:54:06] charvos1: yeah damwons bot have been playing super shitty
[0:54:27] JimBeam1116: whether it be LCK or LPL i don't think they want to be seen the strongest
[0:54:34] charvos1: but in the kt series it wasnt just the bot playing bad, kt played incredibly well
[0:54:42] charvos1: there's still a lot of talent in lck
[0:54:51] JimBeam1116: being the fav, the team is going to be analyzed as much
[0:54:54] charvos1: good series to watch if u havent
