[1:34:11] Munchables: unreal draft diff
[1:34:11] AsfandorLoL: lck looks like SoloQ right now it´s rly sad man

[1:35:17] hermeneutist: lulu has nice synergy with xz/lee but the jhin... feels weird
[1:35:18] Nit3star: WE have a lot of og fans but not as many newer fans
[1:35:29] hsuchihmo: WE was good at season 2 tho
[1:35:36] l3vi1: Chat what's your favorite team? Mine are IG and FPX
[1:35:43] MetaSlave_: @captainkrajick I mean, they kinda had because of the ppgod meme, but it was never comparable to the big teams
[1:35:51] Sorryoyster: EDG
[1:35:51] AsfandorLoL: EDG
[1:35:52] hermeneutist: UP!!!
[1:35:54] bolyvfr: WE is one of the most historic org in cHInA
[1:35:56] Munchables: @hermeneutist because all your damage is from xin/Lee, it's all AD and you have to go in, but it's incredibly hard vs a comp with long range that can just sit at objectives
[1:35:59] ripbeamerboi: @l3vi1 team we
[1:35:59] hermeneutist: <-- smlz stan
[1:35:59] Drekt: EDG and FPX are the most entertaining to watch
[1:36:02] 3erzerk: EDG
[1:36:02] Munchables: plus it's all AD
[1:36:12] monq9: RNG!
[1:36:23] hermeneutist: @Munchables yea for a mo there i thought u meant it's unplayable for WE xD
[1:36:26] AsfandorLoL: Viper is the godking himself, you can´t not fanboy him as an adc player
[1:36:33] l3vi1: lots of EDG fans. Interesting!
[1:36:42] kongmenghao1: suck
[1:36:43] edgelordweeb: @l3vi1 LNG and RA

[1:37:18] robertsyourmothersbrother: what in all that isholy is zoe damage
[1:37:29] hermeneutist: that was probably the reason why V5 went for that mid t1 instead of drake when they got prio just now
[1:37:29] Moobot: Catch all the LPL highlights on our Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/lpl.official/

[1:39:02] 맞짱깔새꺄: V5  Mole?
[1:39:38] l3vi1: @edgelordweeb Oh nice. Feels good to see them with a stronger org, especially after Leyan joined
[1:39:38] MetaSlave_: I don't know why people hype Bo so much, he barely played in the lpl
[1:39:45] Linko98: I wish Jiumeng changed name to AK instead of Elk LUL

[1:43:45] iRiddlez: @hermeneutist Kepler aint a rookie
[1:43:47] MetaSlave_: @AsfandorLoL Yeah, i specially remember the game on Olaf where he completely stomped IG. But still, i'm not convinced only having seen 10 games, specially considering the changes in jungle meta
[1:44:05] Latavius_murray: Man.... WE played so bad this game but they're going to win cuz v5 did a TSM baron. Wow

[1:44:59] tbach495: Victoria 5 = defeat 5
[1:45:07] hermeneutist: @Munchables i don't think it was really the draft... it was just poor baron call
[1:45:09] AsfandorLoL: @MetaSlave_ I agree it´s definitly reasonable to doubt him, I still wanna see him play over Tian, but that´s also because I dislike Tian so...
[1:45:17] bolyvfr: lulu mid @FPXDoinb
[1:45:22] Nit3star: V5 can't finish the game unless they get a baron
[1:45:23] JAG_Blanc: Kepler was the first to describe planetary motions as elliptical rather than in perfect circles POG

[1:45:42] Nit3star: they have no siege otherwise

[2:00:21] Er0yzer: lebronJAM
[2:01:31] mangosmoothieeHD: why LPL and LCK gotta play at the same time
[2:02:06] cornographics: @mangosmoothieeHD just similar time zones and this is usually the most optimal time for them to play I guess
[2:02:09] Latavius_murray: similar time zone.
[2:02:21] RedOsprey: Same time zone unfortunately
[2:02:30] Latavius_murray: u just gotta choose to watch good league (lpl) vs okay league (lck)
[2:02:33] mangosmoothieeHD: Yea  I get that but dam
[2:02:34] alexavier0422: LCK is one hour earlier than LPL
[2:02:54] alexavier0422: LCK＞LPL
[2:02:59] l3vi1: @hermeneutist I see. I don't go LCK stream often unless it's T1 vs DK or something
[2:03:13] mangosmoothieeHD: LPL is fun to watch cause they fight even if the fght to take is bad LCK is dont fight unless its good which is boring
[2:03:52] cornographics: At the end of the day, LCK has a much more developed Western audience and production and LPL is still extremely new
[2:03:52] YourMove348: !score
[2:04:12] l3vi1: @mangosmoothieeHD Yeah in lpl they always think they can outplay the opponent and they have the mechanics to do so
[2:04:19] cornographics: so it is super unfortunate that arguably the world's most fun and best region is getting this little international views
[2:04:35] Cyraxxx: LPL is gonna keep growing
[2:04:54] Drekt: @cornographics I'd argue that LPL production actually looks nicer now
[2:04:59] mangosmoothieeHD: but usually the fight kinda throws the game away if it goes badly is but I mean theyre better than I cam currently so who am I to judge
[2:05:05] COPIUM812: iwdHappy
[2:05:10] Drekt: Especially the graphics
[2:05:22] kittenninjar: only ever started watching LPL becausde my friend betted on a game
[2:05:32] cornographics: @Drekt I definitely agree with you, I am just saying that LCK has a much deeper root internationally than the LPL has been so that is super unfortunate
[2:05:38] sinyotimb0: iwdCroc
[2:05:47] yudai95: friendly reminder that both these teams would win lec and lcs
[2:05:47] 풍호: LPL is growing much faster than LCK.. they sweep up most of rookies in KR solo rank

[2:09:11] hermeneutist: might be a super tiny window when he charges at you but before he touches you
[2:09:15] 10k_betsonly: @3erzerk ez 30kusd if we 2-0
[2:09:16] qesarito: pzx looks like best player on V5

[2:10:32] 10k_betsonly: help me reclaim them
[2:10:45] cornographics: or just don't bet that much in the first place lol
[2:10:52] qesarito: @omnialicent I would like V5 draft even more if tehy sent Sett to support and picked yasuo mid
[2:10:53] Vexiratus: Beishang didn't overheat on red oh my god
[2:11:27] l3vi1: @qesarito Sett support without Hexflash is tough
[2:11:42] hermeneutist: @l3vi1 still gotta burn flash... but i think people do use qss to break free while in the air with sett, that's like a 1s window

[2:19:35] Er0yzer: @qesarito and weiwei and biubiu KEKW
[2:19:42] qesarito: @hermeneutist Its good counterpick because Tf gets free farming lane, imo when V5 saw Tf they should have flexed Sett support and picked Yasuo mid
[2:19:43] hermeneutist: basically any melee mid

[2:23:07] hermeneutist: @Er0yzer you might wanna learn the difference between 'loose' and 'lose'
[2:23:12] j20y4l: over 30' and under 25kill plssss
[2:23:13] qesarito: @Vexiratus they will beat RW KEKW
[2:23:16] cornographics: @qesarito I think they can definitely contend for playoffs spot but just not worlds caliber
[2:23:30] irlgigachad: v5 should try to find some average LPL players instead of all in on random LDL players hoping their mental/playstyle isnt crushed from a long bad split, players like fenfen/jinjiao
[2:23:40] na_omega_lul: @j20y4l  you really bet under 30 on this?
[2:23:42] sanpanther522: LPL KEKW
[2:23:43] Er0yzer: @hermeneutist no? i mean that they are obviously very loose and uncoordinated in their gameplay KEKW totally intended
[2:23:45] theraiderrr: @Vexiratus it sucks cause they built a good team but just don't have the money
[2:23:45] cornographics: their top laner and bot side is just too heavy, unless Mark miraculously stops randomly inting or Garvey gets better as a rookie
[2:23:54] 羊咩吃卡滋: that JG is playing Sup?
[2:24:19] hermeneutist: @Er0yzer you made them sound like a team of loose men D:
[2:24:22] thebaddream7: @0024 LMAO
[2:24:23] Vexiratus: @theraiderrr no, they 100% have the money. Just announced new sponsors and built a new arena in shenzhen
[2:24:24] j20y4l: @na_omega_lul yeah , under 25 kill , and over 30'

[2:24:44] na_omega_lul: hmm idk about the under 30
[2:24:51] hermeneutist: breathe: nope
[2:24:56] qesarito: @cornographics yeah ik, thats why I told that they are competing for playoffs spot to show difference between making playoffs and making worlds and how they are not same caliber of team as top 6 teams

[2:25:16] na_omega_lul: Breathe is so good actually yet another elite lpl top
[2:25:25] j20y4l: oh sr , im bet over 30 minute
[2:25:31] cornographics: @theraiderrr prolly spent all the money getting an arena instead of paying their players KEKW
[2:25:38] Vexiratus: @theraiderrr because it wasn't theirs to begin with. Most of their players were on loan and their other players contracts expired
[2:26:00] qesarito: @na_omega_lul this we roster looks promising PauseChamp
[2:26:28] TheOreoCupcake: KEKW
[2:26:44] TheOreoCupcake: Breathe Diff
[2:26:51] cornographics: honestly WE BLG and LNG seems like they got a really good offseason roster change, might be able to contend with JDG/TES for a worlds spot even
[2:26:51] na_omega_lul: Ye their roster was already promising in spring and now they Upgrade mid
[2:26:52] Er0yzer: guys are u ready to see shad0w the EU talent prodigy smurf absolutely stomp on New V5 ?
[2:26:55] hermeneutist: hysterics nearly xD
[2:27:03] hermeneutist: "whatever's goin on down there"
[2:27:05] theraiderrr: @Vexiratus usually in that spot teams open the wallet to buy the players
[2:27:26] Er0yzer: @cornographics i think lgd had a great offseason aswell
