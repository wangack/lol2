[2:57:26] ouatssss: @StallionM rascal can take one seat out of the top 5
[2:57:34] evaiq: flandre and 369 are top 3 in lpl. nuguri is not top 5
[2:57:39] l3vi1: @StallionM I believe more than just 5. Even TheShy who might not bot top 5 in lpl could still easily gap any top in other regions

[2:59:43] evaiq: @l3vi1 yes he dished out so much damage when he was in grey screen before teamfight. goat adc
[2:59:50] vankopy: poor BeryL he was the best supp last year.
[2:59:53] kill21670: something happened to dk in msi they dont look normal
