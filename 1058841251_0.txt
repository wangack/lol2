[2:55:05] evaiq: @justsaygoodbye6 yes i agree.
[2:55:25] inyourdream336: Nemesis so bad
[2:55:38] evaiq: jkl 1v9ed againt fnc. karsa and knight tried their best to troll him but he was too good

[2:56:01] StallionM: thinking about it, LPL has the best top laners and it ain't even close, probably top 5 of the worlds best tops
[2:56:16] bsdlv: yep
[2:56:26] l3vi1: @evaiq JKL although lost to FNC bot because of his support still carried in teamfights than Reckless
[2:56:30] slu876: @StallionM truth
[2:56:33] yudai95: friendly reminder that all 4 of these teams would easily win any other league
[2:56:53] Kvilten3rd: Nuguri has the highest CSPM by all LPL toplaners, the most GPM, and the highest KS
[2:56:59] slu876: damwon is def not winning worlds LUL

[2:57:22] Potamakis: FPX IS THE BEST TEAM THIS YEAR
[2:57:23] vankopy: irony,  LPL had today the best top laners in the world, time ago LPL hasnt any decent top laner than LetMe (2018) and Gogoing.
[2:57:26] ouatssss: @StallionM rascal can take one seat out of the top 5
[2:57:34] evaiq: flandre and 369 are top 3 in lpl. nuguri is not top 5
[2:57:39] l3vi1: @StallionM I believe more than just 5. Even TheShy who might not bot top 5 in lpl could still easily gap any top in other regions
[2:57:42] TheOreoCupcake: Madge
[2:57:45] Sorryoyster: ale is also good

[2:58:30] yudai95: @l3vi1 i think it was confirmed after the game that TES supp was mind ocntrolling JL into using E forward with ezreal all the time. I saw a thread on reddit, its really unbelievable that someone would be able to do something like that
[2:58:31] slu876: beryl is actually so bad

[2:59:04] StallionM: @ouatssss rascal hasn't shown me he can 1v5 like how LPL best top laners can. He does good to absorb weakside pressure and stay relevant but you don't get him to 1v5 even if you put resources to him
[2:59:04] evaiq: @yudai95 disgusting support player mind controlling jkl. should be perma banned
[2:59:07] TomeiMutsuki: Is bo better than Tian?
[2:59:08] 이준혁0: darkzan
[2:59:10] l3vi1: @evaiq I agree that and his positioning at times he did horribly in that series but he still was fearless in teamfights and dished out a lot dmg that his team could easily clean up afterwards

[2:59:40] Kvilten3rd: Nuguri has the highest GPM, CSPM, KS and GS by all LPL top laners. He's doing allright
[2:59:42] l3vi1: @yudai95 Really? I didn't know that
[2:59:43] evaiq: @l3vi1 yes he dished out so much damage when he was in grey screen before teamfight. goat adc
[2:59:50] vankopy: poor BeryL he was the best supp last year.
[2:59:53] kill21670: something happened to dk in msi they dont look normal
[3:00:01] slu876: @mainanalyst i actually think LEC casters are the best imo. anything is better than :CK at least

[3:02:42] l3vi1: @evaiq I clearly said dished out more dmg that his steam could easily clean up afterwards. That's better than playing super passive that all your teammates are dead but you're alive and can't do anything
[3:02:42] evaiq: jkl nearly went even in lane vs the goat duo of dl and corejj. that is why jkl is the greatest
