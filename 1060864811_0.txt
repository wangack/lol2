[0:57:06] thehollowkaizer: @minnetjes Yeah thats true, many games are unpredictable although we r only in week 2
[0:57:31] minnetjes: @thehollowkaizer true true, it's good to see fnc seemed to have woken up at least haha
[0:57:36] HungryNaut: OMG 2-1 RNG LUL

[0:59:45] licald256: EZ LCS > LPL
[0:59:46] thehollowkaizer: @captainkrajick Rummors are spreading that S04 is leaving LEC for Team BDS
[0:59:47] minnetjes: guldborg Pog, wishing him good luck
[0:59:48] Cyraxxx: glad to see more western fans in lpl
[0:59:52] captainkrajick: @minnetjes I'm not sure, cause I think they let him go because they can't pay his salary or something like that.
[1:00:21] captainkrajick: @thehollowkaizer Yeah this is their last split. The football team got relegated and is really in debt, so they have to get immediate cash
[1:00:35] minnetjes: @captainkrajick hmm interesting bc it says he's still a "substitute jungler" for them... and kirei's performance was subpar yesterday, it can't rly be acceptable (even though it's sad)
[1:00:46] minnetjes: sad for schalke tbh :(
[1:00:51] detaaaa: OMG > RNG > DK KEKW
[1:01:09] thehollowkaizer: @captainkrajick Thats Sad, moral should be low and impacting their summer split
[1:01:14] cornographics: @thehollowkaizer it is pretty much confirmed lol, not a rumor anymore iirc
[1:01:14] awcalv: when game start
[1:01:15] captainkrajick: @minnetjes Sad for me as a new fan. I only started watching pro league at the same time as the miracle run
[1:01:23] thatsdanny4u: IG yuniLOL
[1:01:33] Cyraxxx: schalke is a well run org, hope they keep everyone onboard
[1:01:52] captainkrajick: Schalke is very open about everything going on in the team
[1:01:56] NickyLux: let's go Sunning
[1:02:01] captainkrajick: They don't hide anything, and that's why I really love them
[1:02:03] cornographics: @Cyraxxx Maybe not Kirei lmao he is really underwhelming for the past few years
[1:02:09] minnetjes: @captainkrajick awww yeah i also loved seeing schalke shape up a little over the years! it's too bad
[1:02:12] captainkrajick: It's sad that it has to end that way
[1:02:18] lita_lol123: so early today CrreamAwk

[1:02:57] minnetjes: tbh i believe in the 0-2 teams haha. there's always room for upsets
[1:03:07] captainkrajick: It would be an incredible achievement tho if they finally make it to worlds as their parting gift
[1:03:08] d0_g0: RW KEKW
[1:03:16] defusedfrog: when this gonna start damn
[1:03:20] captainkrajick: Would be the happiest way to end it
[1:03:24] thehollowkaizer: Which team we need to watch out? Seems RNG are having MSI Hangover. LPL team look scary
[1:03:56] minnetjes: LPL also suffering roster swaps? they seem hard to get used to
[1:04:03] d0_g0: LNG and WE looking good
[1:04:10] cornographics: @captainkrajick Honestly not impossible at all for Schalke, having only 3 worlds spots definitely hurted their chance but beside Rogue I think most middle-top tier teams all have their chances at making it out
[1:04:23] DragonflightLoL: hey guys its time for lpl
[1:04:50] captainkrajick: @cornographics They have a curse of always being 1 series away from Worlds tho. Hopefully they break it
[1:04:58] cornographics: @minnetjes I think it is the opposite lol, teams with roster changes (except for the bottom tier teams ofc) are actually doing much better
[1:05:32] cornographics: @captainkrajick I know BibleThump but let's hope that they can finally do it this year
[1:05:36] strainer_: why lec rerun got more view than this LUL
[1:05:40] minnetjes: @cornographics wait oh that's interesting! the opposite is kind of happening in some LEC teams... they seem to be struggling to get the hang of it (altho fnc finally seemed to have gotten used to it)
[1:05:49] DragonflightLoL: Clappy
[1:06:45] cornographics: @minnetjes hahaha yeah bwipo is not as bad as people try to claim him to be. But he definitely needed to clean up some random over-aggression and besides that, the fnc team is actually going to do well!
[1:07:44] Vexiratus: wtf viego
[1:07:49] minnetjes: @cornographics tbh i think putting bwipo in jungle was smart, he has a TON of game knowledge so he can influence the macro sooo much. i think fnc's weak spot is usually hyli, bc he dies so much for no reason (didn't happen as much last night!!! thankfully haha)
[1:07:49] ÏÇºÎèÑÏ≤úÏã¨Ìï¥Ïñ¥: ratJAM
[1:08:17] kepzzz: LEC talk. cool.

[1:12:07] bruntyboi: Lulu Karma both up monkaS
[1:12:07] kepzzz: LNG still not losing PogChamp
[1:12:15] cornographics: @0024 He needed that synergy with Kongyue imo, without Kongyue he is really not that good lol
[1:12:48] kepzzz: @cornographics its been sad since he decide to move to LPL. last split on LGD not good either. now get worse.
[1:12:52] Shrumz: seriously who thought a bright pink background would be a good idea?
[1:12:52] cornographics: I mean if we talk about not world class but even PCS mids, FoFo is miles ahead of Uniboy in my opinion

[3:55:07] zhen0501: @kotofusion *visible confusion*
[3:55:19] kotofusion: @cheshirew33 so u think tt, rw, up, v5 has the ability to challenge other teams?
[3:55:24] akasora: viper is the best adc atm, lck couldnt build a team around him but lpl did
[3:55:25] revengedpls: rogue warriors would be 1st seed in lck
[3:55:26] 21neguin: @henrlcco true
[3:55:36] l3vi1: @kotofusion LPL has better "average teams strength" than any other region unless we consider 1-12 to be top teams
[3:55:40] oniki22: LNG top 3 right now no doubt
[3:55:47] cheshirew33: @luvnth8 ahead as region means ave teams are better, lck is bad rn cuz it‚Äôs just dk
[3:55:47] Chronox0: @akasora like griffin lmao
[3:55:47] TheOreoCupcake: @kotofusion RW beat OMG and OMG beat RNG
[3:56:08] hotdiggity86: all this time wasted when Edward is just going to demolish them in gm2 ResidentSleeper
[3:56:13] bookofexodus: IG no Theshy is bad
[3:56:17] cheshirew33: @kotofusion no, look at lck, it‚Äôs just dk, look at lpl, there are more teams that are good
[3:56:21] È∏£È∏ü‰∏çÈ£û: Lng and omg looks strong tbh
[3:56:21] luvnth8: @luvnth8 Doesnt change the fact that he came from lck? if local talents as big as china has to buy koreans, it really doesnt prove much other than the fact that lck as a region has too many talents
[3:56:24] oniki22: LNG plays like a new Griffin team
[3:56:34] no_crowns_for_kings: Fact that DK is winning series is just sad. Imagine LPL with knight going adc and Karsa playing mid lmao. That team would get hard stomped by like at least eight other teams...
[3:56:50] yudai95: LCK has been bad for 3 years, their only team is DK, lec has been bad since forever, their only team is G2, lpl isnt a one team region, its more like a 10 team region
[3:56:55] bookofexodus: IG is in trouble hope Theshy come back soon
[3:56:57] È∏£È∏ü‰∏çÈ£û: Rng will be back soon anyways matmanBunny

[3:57:03] akasora: @akasora its funny the griffin team that went to china , THRIVING, stayed in lck? well...needless to say disappointment
[3:57:05] mangomochee67: LCK will probably bring DK T1 GenG and maybe NS to worlds

[3:58:46] TheOreoCupcake: BabyGunner, if you get hungry looking at my name, eat me Kappa
[3:58:47] l3vi1: @luvnth8 We're talking about LPL vs LCK not Korean players vs Chinese players. If Faker joins an lpl teams he's an LPL player. So Koreans being in lpl shouldn't matter

[3:58:59] 1998zzz: rng need a midlaner

[3:59:53] no_crowns_for_kings: LCK cant even treat their own players properly. Look at the whole Cvmax scandal and the wage gap between LCK and LPL. Its a crime.
[3:59:53] È∏£È∏ü‰∏çÈ£û: Lulu kogmo combo DansGame

[4:00:01] hsuchihmo: LCK is the best ,they will get all 4 teams in semis this worlds,NS/GenG/DK/T1
[4:00:05] TheOreoCupcake: @luvnth8 You can't possibly quote winning worlds as a indication of good. Then Piglet is one of the best ADC ever in the game. Crown is the best mid in the world. KEKW Flawed Argument.
