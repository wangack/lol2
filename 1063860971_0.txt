[0:12:20] youcantcontrolme1: @TAO4ev3r it has to do with scheduling best of 3s versus best of ones. also western leagues see it as tuning into THE SHOW whereas eastern leagues have just games you tune into. it depends on if you want to maximize viewership for all the games or not.
[0:12:25] usoto215: @TAO4ev3r good question idk

[0:20:48] PikachugXD: @Rakirei I mean Griffin made the mistake of using Sword instead of Doran
[0:21:10] PikachugXD: like Doran wasn't the best top but at least he wasn't D tier and could play tanks
