[2:10:33] Maestro_from_hell: sn game 2 and 3 mark my word
[2:10:57] autumnrainbells: @JazzRetriever No problem, it's a pretty good show. Only a few episodes, can't wait for the new ones
[2:10:58] yukihearts2k: @angrybirdsissofunuwu honestly the calorie amount is closer than you’re imagining, but it’s the actually food itself that’s so bad in NA
[2:11:07] trithong234: I really mis swordart. He changed SN
[2:11:09] unique_mode: rice has more calories than meat

[2:11:46] prch902888: As a League of Legends fan I gotta admit Dota2 is way better than LOL it's like comparing a Bugatti to a Toyota
[2:11:57] Rakirei: I guess they needed to hire more people since there are so many games
[2:12:05] gaomin0829: Sn needs command
[2:12:10] phantasmagoriamoth: That one guy is from IRLs. I think he casts NLC
[2:12:23] eu_lost_in_playins_kekw: @pandorahearts2kk ye is just this region repeats not to eat like NA
[2:12:29] Rakirei: Just the lost of SwordArt made them fall from the top?
[2:12:49] Rakirei: Or was it a really good meta for Suning at last Worlds?
[2:13:25] pemulek: lpl teams dont last long, they usually dominate a split and then fall off for no reason @rakirei
[2:13:26] 小鸡东东: sn needs a better shotcall rn
[2:13:28] gaomin0829: The commander of swordart SN
[2:13:33] Maestro_from_hell: @prch902888 i play dota n lol because i like to play game.. both game have strenght and weaknesses. both game enjoyable
[2:13:41] 小鸡东东: swordart is the igl of sn
[2:13:47] pemulek: obviously teams like fpx, ig do decently but not as good as they did in their prime
[2:13:51] trithong234: Swordart was their shot caller so the lost of his is the big lost
