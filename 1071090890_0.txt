[0:15:47] NormalGuy66: Edg lord with the hand gun
[0:15:55] Kicoru: EDG is kinda all scout and Viper imo
[0:16:04] robertsyourmothersbrother: flandre has been performing super well.
[0:16:21] killua788: IG FeelsBadMan
[0:16:23] Kicoru: That’s true too

[0:18:44] NormalGuy66: You can only spam the same comp so many time@before someone figure out I’m how to counter it
[0:18:54] Martin527: FeelsOkayMan
[0:18:57] robertsyourmothersbrother: I don't mind them not winning but would like them to show that they can play as consistenyl as they have been in them and then im convinced they win worlds
[0:19:01] Kicoru: Every other region is shaky af and it’s legit DK (LCK) vs LPL
[0:19:01] toxicartsss: Who are up are they new? Seen they have hacker

[0:24:46] NormalGuy66: True they all are good just have to see what team messes up the most and they’re all really good at exploiting it
[0:24:47] qurkka: LCK only has NS and GENG who are good regionally but internationally they gon get exposed
[0:24:54] robertsyourmothersbrother: Neny under-rated people are still wanting to put Theshy in :/

[0:26:40] maniacoakz: Is TheShy back
[0:27:07] qurkka: EDG is pretty insane as a team with Scout and Meiko being pretty experienced and Viper and Flandre just smurfing in their current roles
[0:27:13] lplpog: New classement espn top 3 edg lng fpx 4 geng LUL
[0:27:13] Kicoru: I can’t express with words at how good he is atm. Like LCK 2020 he was a 10th place team player
