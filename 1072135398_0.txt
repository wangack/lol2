[2:27:27] bingobongon1: OPEN
[2:27:29] BLG_worlds_2024: @TMGNear there is a difference than best champion and best at carrying
[2:27:35] bingobongon1: shitty draft from BLG
[2:27:56] nanoide1: relax carry game lee sind and sylas
[2:28:00] autumnrainbells: I change teams to bet and still lose BibleThump
[2:28:11] maniacoakz: Well once the riot incentive ends for people to stop forcing Gwen people can draft reasonable comps tbh
[2:28:16] bingobongon1: you cant play 3 weak side lane in this meta
[2:28:24] maniacoakz: Gwen is a mediocre top laner who is very easy to counter
[2:28:46] mortsure: @omghmm varus does everything since MSI his presence shows it
[2:28:47] aproximity99: NotLikeThis Yuumi jungle ;-;

[2:29:23] justthelightofdawn: imagine being timed out for talking about eating glue
[2:29:23] BLG_worlds_2024: @TMGNear varus is a good champion but what I'm saying is that he isnt a hard carry champion like a jinx, kai'sa, etc.
[2:29:27] maniacoakz: They play every new champ dude
[2:29:43] realtw2020: BLG COPIUM
[2:29:46] maniacoakz: I mean seriously no one notices that every new champion is picked in almost every draft for years now?
[2:30:04] maniacoakz: League esports is just a marketing campaign
[2:30:12] Â±±ÂßÜÁîúÁîú: bcuz they're strong enough to get into pro play
[2:30:22] maniacoakz: Not really
[2:30:29] dynaschee: blg wins late lets go baby
[2:30:34] maniacoakz: Lillia was horrible and riot incentive forced lillia for months
[2:30:35] mortsure: @omghmm cant disagree ! he would be ban 100% if he could pewpew like jinx
[2:30:36] stingerOo: did people from wow come into LoL now? all this whinning
[2:30:40] dynaschee: BibleThump
[2:30:54] tesmolol: Tryndmere dodging nerfs disgusting
[2:31:00] itsmrpoek: @maniacoak riot just doesn't care or pay attention I think, the lec did a pop quiz asking for which champ needs nerfs or to be removed and nearly all of them said to remove or nerf gene but will it happen? no, never they need more money
[2:31:06] BLG_worlds_2024: @TMGNear that's what im saying. varus cannot 1v5 like a jinx can.

[2:32:05] bossnno: BLG fans turn for the COPIUM
[2:32:18] mortsure: @omghmm on the other hand he share the best lane phase with ezreal
[2:32:18] itsmrpoek: @maniacoak she hasn't been meta for months so why would she, she is still fairly strong but not needed tn
[2:32:42] maniacoakz: My point is lillia was so busted she should still be bused
[2:32:46] maniacoakz: She was never good
[2:32:52] NeVeR_IosEs: 3K LUL LUL LUL
[2:32:58] bossnno: @stingerOo the nerfs did hit her quite hard, and also ur right about the meta shift. good lillia players like wei and inspired still made it work tho
[2:33:00] saffronfoxtrot: yes she was?
[2:33:01] NeVeR_IosEs: 10min 3k
[2:33:07] maniacoakz: Pros just tend to play new things suspciously and leave old things to rot until someone spams it and they cant pretend it isnt good anymore. See Udyrt
[2:33:08] grimmadz: they nerfed the r cooldown on lilia
[2:33:08] tesmolol: Lillia is op dude she‚Äôs still op

[2:33:50] tesmolol: Lillia 1 trick crying
[2:33:52] SauGemini: Kaisa got gutted and yet Kaisa is still played so much in LPL
[2:33:58] itsmrpoek: @maniacoak wait but how wrong are? xD Lilia has gotten adjusted repeatedly, I just looked at the patch history and she was adjusted on patch 10.15,10.16,10.23,11.1 and 11.6
[2:34:15] maniacoakz: ALl nerfs or what?
[2:34:33] lgnxz: these 2 junglers are just sinnning, their cs and level are so low
[2:34:42] maniacoakz: I mean 10.14 and 10.16 wer eliterally bug fixes

[2:36:17] TheBloodGodNZ: They also changed the item system. Champs are not the same lmao
[2:36:28] maniacoakz: V11.6 Lilting Lullaby Lilting Lullaby Cooldown increased to 150 / 130 / 110 seconds from 130 / 110 / 90. This is lillias actual only nerf since she released on launch.
[2:36:37] CJDM310: looks like I threw away my channel points NotLikeThis
[2:36:45] grimmadz: yeah what is Lillia gonna do with 600 mana she needs the health

[2:37:49] kepzzz: fight for 2nd herald NICEE
[2:38:01] maniacoakz: Because people dont like to bother to go rediscovered old champs that are secretly insane until someone does that work for them

[2:40:44] bossnno: @maniacoak i mean theres always pocket picks, but the problem is most pros arent practicing every champ. for example nasus + varus stomps kalista, but it much easier to simply ban the kalista rather than learn a new playstyle that wont transfer onto other picks
[2:40:46] taumarino: mole gets penta by now

[2:46:23] szocska5: Uh RNG vs TES so good match
[2:46:24] valyotheking: Thats the point, if LEC continues plauing B01, they will never improve = not international success= resulting in even less viewership
[2:46:25] lunarwolffff: we won 4 for 1 but BLG still reduced gold lead
[2:46:25] stingerOo: @bossnno you're right, but i'd watch g2 vs rogue if it was bo3, this way I don't care
