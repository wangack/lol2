[3:48:32] therealjiggyjus: lol imaging thinking DoinB is better than Knight
[3:48:35] qurkka: Creme would be the best mid in LCK actually
[3:48:37] Dekabristas: @theoreocupcake Forgetting Nukeduck???
[3:49:02] ipewu: @qurkka chovy?
[3:49:02] ye1l: I don't think Creme is currently better than Caps at his best, but I definitely think that he will be soon enough
[3:49:02] Janeway: Where is Huanfeng the best ADC in the world?
[3:49:14] TheOreoCupcake: @Dekabristas Ignoring, more like.
[3:49:21] mangomochee67: ALE is super underrated, should be top 10 imo
[3:49:25] JVhunts: That's what i mean, thinking that Creme is better than Caps atm, i just don't see it
[3:49:28] qurkka: first split of this guy and he already on best 15 players list
[3:49:30] ye1l: Like meme all you want on G2 but Caps is literally 1v9 every single game since start of spring
[3:49:30] TheOreoCupcake: @therealjiggyjus DoinB > Knight
[3:49:33] Vuhta: @Janeway prolly with one of his gfs KEKW
[3:49:37] ye1l: and he was 1v9 all of last summer
[3:49:39] Matheusote_: @CognusNA I mean... I would put Viper over Ming in there
[3:49:45] Dekabristas: @theoreocupcake iwdCroc iwdCroc
[3:49:45] yudai95: flandre would be by far bets top in LEC/LCS, creme by far best mid in LEC/LCS karsa by far best jungler in LEC/LCS gala by far best adci n LEC/LCS ming by far best sup LEC/LCS
[3:49:49] TheOreoCupcake: @therealjiggyjus Knight has better mechanics but DoinB is so much better with the map.
[3:50:00] JVhunts: yudai95 that's just delusional
[3:50:12] SwissCake: ratJAM
[3:50:16] mangomochee67: @yudai95 hard disagree wtf
[3:50:20] yudai95: @JVhunts i dont think so
[3:50:23] therealjiggyjus: doinB isnt better than Knight IMO. Knight's mechanics are otherworldly. DoinB's roaming style is always going to make him stand out
[3:50:27] qurkka: LebronJAM
[3:50:29] therealjiggyjus: hes great. just not better than knight lol
[3:50:30] UpYerArs: @CognusNA Take out Ming from RNG and the entire team will collapse. Viper out from EDG not so much.

[3:50:57] vicviper: doinb is only good because AP junglers are viable
[3:51:05] JVhunts: I mean, everyone is entiltled to their own opinion, sure, but there's a limit lol
[3:51:06] Dekabristas: @yudai95 Flandre has nothing on Bob Jenkins iwdNA iwdNA
[3:51:06] TheOreoCupcake: @therealjiggyjus You said it. Mechanics alone won't win the game though. DoinB is still good with certain hard champions but his map.
[3:51:08] mangomochee67: Doinb and Nuguri is 2v9, doinb deserves the respect over knight
[3:51:09] ipewu: @CognusNA yeah but this is a best player list not an MVP list

[3:52:42] vicviper: @vicviper how about you check why RNG won the spring finals, doinb has a weird champ pool that makes him very good in some meta and crap in other meta
[3:52:43] ipewu: @CognusNA yeah I often watch LCK more but im getting into LPL now I used to watch it but stopped
[3:52:46] TheOreoCupcake: @discord_421 I mean were those LEC mids really going up against the best mids in LPL? Nemesis faced Xiaohu in 2019 and 2019 RNG was trash.
[3:52:54] benjamin_er_bonderoev69: @JVhunts Caps isn't even a top LEC mid right now, of course Creme is better
[3:53:03] UpYerArs: iwdNA LCS is better than Keeping Up With The Kardashians
[3:53:08] yudai95: @JVhunts ok maybe by far is too big, but i think hes better than any lec mid
[3:53:14] JVhunts: What lol
[3:53:23] YeroOne: forsenE LETS GO FORSEN forsenE
[3:53:28] JVhunts: benjamin_er_bonderoev69 player performance and team performance is a different thing

[3:54:49] Dekabristas: Chat what are these hot takes?? Is it hotline league here??
[3:54:57] benjamin_er_bonderoev69: @JVhunts yeah not the best, but still better than a mid tier LEC mid

[3:55:20] robertsyourmothersbrother: that was pog

[3:56:18] vicviper: OMG will get knocked out in the first round of playoffs LUL
[3:56:25] benjamin_er_bonderoev69: @JVhunts I mean look at his stats and map influence compared to other LEC mids. Mids like Humanoid, Larssen, Vetheo are doing far better
[3:56:25] qurkka: That too, we will see a match between LPL and G2 in worlds if we are lucky
[3:56:28] robertsyourmothersbrother: @CognusNA do i bow down now ?
[3:56:38] discord_421: @TheOreoCupcake Angel is a top five LPL mid and Caps was convincing against him, Nemisis while he lost versus Knight was not being stomped every game, all his CS discrepancy was put into Selfmade. Perkz has a decent record vs decent LPL teams.
[3:56:39] nayu_panda: Game 2 let‚Äôs go

[3:57:15] JVhunts: You are, once again, mixing team performance with player performance on a single split. Regardless, let's drop this and focus on the game we are watching right now
[3:57:21] robertsyourmothersbrother: @bossnno what you mean techerma is not best in world?

[3:57:42] nezo_pont: Rammus OK
[3:57:51] TheOreoCupcake: @discord_421 Perkz has a decent record against RNG specifically which was Xiaohu.
[3:57:56] bossnno: @robertsyourmothersbrother he is one of the best plat players in the world tbf
[3:58:02] mangomochee67: i can't gamble, its stuck when i click JDG Sadge
[3:58:06] robertsyourmothersbrother: :D
[3:58:15] benjamin_er_bonderoev69: @JVhunts No just look at caps cspm, kp and gameplay
[3:58:15] vicviper: teacherma best galio but people don't let him play by banning LUL
[3:58:15] TheOreoCupcake: @discord_421 Angel isn't a top 5 mid, not anymore at least.

[3:59:46] discord_421: @TheOreoCupcake He was definitely performing at worlds beyond what he usually does sure, but if you are arguing with the current top mids of the LPL then like half of them have never actually played against an LEC team so everything is pointless to talk about?

[4:02:28] robertsyourmothersbrother: I am liking Hirit right now
[4:02:32] Jet_Stingray: I'd say Trymbi, which is kinda ironic considering he's a rookie
[4:02:33] discord_421: @TheOreoCupcake Yeah sure, but that sort of thing usually takes a lot more analytics then historic records against a region, and since we haven't seen LEC teams in their BO3's yet, it can be hard to actually judge how they are playing across a series which is where wheat is really separated from chaff.
[4:02:34] qurkka: Inspired got exposed against G2 actually ? 0-6 Fiddlesticks lmao

[4:03:50] discord_421: @qurkka See this is what I'm talking about, Inspired is a really good jungler, but we've only seen him in BO1's this split and if he has a bad game that really colours people's analysis of him
