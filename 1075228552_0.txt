[3:55:07] Twothry: FPX vs IG POGGERS
[3:55:07] Laviners: @HystericsCasts I just think itd make sense, also for the english casts, that there arent two games overlapping and taking place at the same time. But I understand.
[3:55:30] Stephi44: but imagine if they put LNG vs FPX....that would be such an interesting game
[3:55:30] HystericsCasts: Well the english audience doesnt really mind because they dont use chinese social media
[3:55:31] Laviners: @vashcooks change schedule when a game is set to start :)
[3:55:57] HystericsCasts: Perma banning
[3:55:59] vashcooks: that's like saying any sport where you have multiple games on Sundays should stagger them for viewership, makes 0 sense

[3:57:15] HystericsCasts: Go and google it, it's 2021
[3:57:16] vashcooks: this is objectively the best solution to show all games - in the past english broadcast would switch mid game instead of doing this
[3:57:18] HystericsCasts: Use the internet
[3:57:35] Laviners: @vashcooks thats exactly what they do tho lol. with Euros tonight the games are 3 hours apart EXACTLY so they dont overlap because its not nice to miss games because they overlap. Of course, this is possible when theres 2-3-4 games running (like with euros or LPL) not for games where you need to get 10 games underway
[3:57:35] younpe: LUL
[3:57:39] autumnrainbells: lol

[6:56:03] autumnrainbells: @Nixieed Dude, you're contradicting yourself so hard
[6:56:05] Gericc22: @Nixieed YOU SAID COMP WAS BUILT FOR NUGURI 1v9. it doesn't matter if everyone was 0/20. NUGURI HAS 8 KILLS. HE SHOULD HAVE CARRIED because YOU said that the COMP was BUILT around that
[6:56:06] timeracer999_: If LWX didn't have 20 kill and extreme lead, he won't do shied
[6:56:07] nixxy_7: holy molly that lucian draven dmg just melted akali

[6:56:23] Luannkkl: fpx win?
[6:56:25] amvlaz: 2-0 for ig?
[6:56:34] nixxy_7: @gericc22 ya but akali was vs a 10/0 draven and a 10/0 lucian feed :) lwx had to do some dmg... akali literally did solo dmg 20k :) she did same dmg as draven

[6:57:36] 21neguin: @andueh1 thank you
[6:57:37] Gericc22: @Nixieed IF the comp was BUILT around 1v9 for NUGURI. he should have dealt 9x ANY champ from IG. and not THE SAME as a comp NOT BUILT AROUND draven
[6:57:39] isararaa: Wink <3
[6:57:47] timeracer999_: The comp wasn't for 1v9. YOU DON'T PUT RESOURCES INTO 1 GUY when u have Rumble jungle and Aphelios. That argument WAS RIDICULOUSLY FLAWED.
[6:58:00] inyourdream336: FPX and LNG LUL

[7:00:31] Vens5: monkaW ?
[7:00:32] leinadtyy: If beaulo has a million fans, then I am one of them. If beaulo has ten fans, then I am one of them. If beaulo has only one fan then that is me. If beaulo has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against beaulo, then I am against the world.
