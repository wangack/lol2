[0:02:43] irlgigachad: UP 2-1
[0:03:00] niikkeru: 56years ResidentSleeper
[0:03:25] irlgigachad: this first series is lowkey interesting / sad
[0:03:29] tula4k: HI
[0:03:46] irlgigachad: if you look at the rest of v5's sched, if they lose this they are most likely going winless
[0:04:08] puff400: v5 Sadge
[0:04:19] niikkeru: the bottom team versus
[0:04:24] irlgigachad: v5 need this series to avoid the likely shame of a winless split

[0:07:29] eqxrepose: UP 2-1 V5 EDG 1-2 OMG
[0:08:37] irlgigachad: i believe in RNG, they will accomplish what IG failed to do in 2019. Win spring and miss worlds
[0:10:08] irlgigachad: pretty sure no matter what even if miss playoffs they are AQ to regionals, 2019 IG was first rounded by LNG, but had a miracle regionals run
[0:10:43] goodboy_yanfei: up vs v5 pog

[0:13:29] theomgfather: lebronJAM
[0:13:37] freeko: it is mathematically possible for RNG to miss out on being top 6 in championship points in total
[0:14:01] freeko: not likely, but it is possible

[0:16:17] irlgigachad: yeah that would require crazy outcomes where 2 non-T6 get top 2 and perfect scenarios for other teams in regards of points, you'd need finals of RA-LNG or something like that

[0:17:31] generalnotion: KEKW
[0:17:34] niks_angel: bc they are so bad
[0:17:38] freeko: a team like OMG making a deep run into playoffs, finishing second for example is a major part of RNG being out of regionals if they miss out on getting points in summer.
[0:17:42] theomgfather: too busy being good at physical sports
[0:17:45] generalnotion: why are we waiting for literally the worst possible game in the LPL

[0:21:38] loadingerrors: every team that went to MSI is playing poorly
[0:22:19] freeko: summer split winner, and highest championship point team (usually second in summer split) are the #1 and #2 worlds seeds
[0:22:50] freeko: the next 4 teams rated by championship points are then put into the regional gauntlet
[0:23:08] DowDowTheDonut: ha gigabyte marines never went to msi so they dodged the curse
[0:23:21] chubsterrr: the qualification system is a lot more complicated it seems
