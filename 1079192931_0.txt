[2:57:37] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @rickehv lucky spring LUL smashed regular season and won a convincing finals against fpx who is cheered by many people as the team that will win sure LUL
[2:57:41] rue_de_strasse: @rickehv yeah rng are also struggling

[2:58:14] 03c63ef3: k3llyLost this music
[2:58:23] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @rickehv im not an rng fan LUL but thinking they are in a bad spot is a nobrainer LUL they can easily qualify in regional finals LUL 2 LPL TEAMS will come from there LUL
[2:58:38] Jesus_ls_Here: @prettygoodjobsooofar that's common sense cos LPL has 17 teams so it's naturally more competitive than all the other 10 team regions
[2:58:43] malz1991: they got there by a cheesy backdoor vs EDG @NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING . EDG is by far the better team
[2:58:50] DesterkX: LPL AND LCK layouts smash other regions
[2:58:51] liketearsintherain: pepeD
[2:59:02] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @rickehv decent playoff run if possible will win them championship points spot in worlds LUL if not they can win regional qualifiers LUL bad spot btw LUL
[2:59:05] inyourdream336: DK 1th LCK not even beat LPL 13th ResidentSleeper
[2:59:10] malz1991: @NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING ladder wise they are in a bad spot. not even top 10
[2:59:10] jamespac123: 4 spots LCK KEKW

[2:59:26] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @rickehv edg is the better team for sure LUL but dont be bitter LUL
[2:59:29] rue_de_strasse: @Jesus_ls_Here LPL have over double the world class teams of any other region whilst having less than double the teams
[2:59:44] malz1991: points wise sure they will prob be 3th or 4th seed @NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING
[2:59:45] b00b00baba: LCK refugees are malding because RNG beat Damwon and they are now at bottom tier team in LPL KEKW

[3:00:23] poogiesman: FPX > EDG
[3:00:27] bimbo_aus: @prettygoodjobsooofar viper went to lpl and is 1st place whats ur point brother
[3:00:31] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @rickehv rng already proved themselves in spring and msi LUL edg easily a top 2 team for me but win the games that matter first lol, lost in spring and just lost 2-0 to TES
[3:00:42] rue_de_strasse: LPL are the best region because they have a mix of insane regional talent and KR imports, plus they have by light years the most investment and infrastructure out of any League scene
[3:00:44] Jesus_ls_Here: @Jesus_ls_Here it's like what riot did by adding iron to soloq, 17 teams mean the bottom teams will be really bad but you'll have 10 or more super good and competitive teams
[3:00:46] azuredragonag: @prettygoodjobsooofar and now DWG has no nuguri, I watch their games. They are weaker. Unlikely they will make Worlds final.
[3:01:02] jamespac123: @prettygoodjobsooofar lpl learn viper how to play adc not like lck adc s KEKW
[3:01:02] malz1991: but no the finals werent that good as DK

[3:01:26] odka_winter: ALL IN FPX?
[3:01:33] Jesus_ls_Here: @rue_de_strasse investment and infrastructure is a fair point too, it's being treated as a major sport in china

[4:57:57] ÊúàÈ£ü: @floofykitties it is, even solo q is so toxic. the reason why our queue is short compared to NA or CHN is becauss most of Koreans pick early Champs like Lee Sin, Ezreal. That's why master yi is not picked in solo q because what's the point of picking late game Champs if it won't get to late game because if you lose too much trades in 10 minutes most of them will open mid which is annoying for as an enemy and as an ally.
