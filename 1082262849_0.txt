[2:44:31] jamespac123: why people say chovy would go to edg . This would be a huge downgrade from scout
[2:44:36] axletron: @PayFF I don't think it's delusional. Chovy's had some insane CS numbers and has won many games single-handedly on non-carry Champs. When we see him on a world-class team, a better argument can be made though
[2:44:45] yIlInzHanGG: RNG cannot win without schedule fixing
[2:44:46] axletron: @PayFF Have they? :/
[2:44:51] yIlInzHanGG: as you can all see now
[2:45:00] tikal144: @alucard_166510 it's a joke obviously, EDG are 9-1 why tf would they bring Chovy knowing scout has been the backbone for the last 5 years or so
[2:45:02] Vuhta: Chovy is so good no good team wants him PepeLaugh
[2:45:07] not_a_real_human_: RNG giving away 2 LPL slots, how generous FeelsOkayMan

[2:45:11] PayFF: @axletron have u seen knight rookie and doing teams literally running it down
[2:45:20] martin76b: why did RNG do so bad after winning MSI?
[2:45:23] bossnno: @bossnno pyosik was decent, deft is alright but thats not a quaterfinal standard roster
[2:45:27] yaghi88phantom: rng got worse becuase worlds team were worse than lpl
