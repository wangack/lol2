[0:37:50] imaugment: Go back to watching dude too poor to fix his nasal issues.
[0:38:05] CadhlaShuckle: @imaugment around last year, dom was estimated to earn around 350k on just YouTube. use Google pal. it's not that hard, and the question is frankly unnecessary here
[0:38:17] thegunkmeister: @imaugment tell twitch chat more about your life that nobody asked about
[0:38:26] CadhlaShuckle: now, let's vibe riddlesGun
[0:38:27] imaugment: @KamiShuckle ?? So he's poorer than my unemployed wife. oof.
[0:38:38] thegunkmeister: Look at the car he drives. That’s worth more than you’ll ever make lmao
[0:38:39] xAnnihil8oRx: BLG 2 - 0? hmmm
[0:38:46] imaugment: @thegunkmeister ??? I didn't bring his money up xD
[0:38:46] xAnnihil8oRx: Probs 2 -1?
[0:38:52] Chromodar: I haven't been keeping up with LPL much this split, why is LNG doing so well? Is it just Tarzan smurfing or are the other players actually good?
[0:38:59] CadhlaShuckle: oh shit, we got a Saudi oil prince in chat? tobiasHAPPY
[0:39:22] CadhlaShuckle: @chromodar mix of both. Tarzan especially been nuts though
[0:39:35] imaugment: @thegunkmeister yeah, beemer suits him. LMAO
[0:39:46] imaugment: definitely a stereotypical beemer driver
[0:39:56] thegunkmeister: Only the coolest of guys who definitely have a successful life crap on others in twitch chat for being poor. This guy probably has the best life out of all of us. Must be a real happy fella
[0:40:00] Tetchqq: so early Pog
[0:40:10] Chromodar: @KamiShuckle I'm assuming at least one of the laners is rly good otherwise it's hard for jungle to do everything
[0:40:18] imaugment: @thegunkmeister He did it to me :D
[0:40:28] imaugment: dom must be so cool
[0:40:31] testlum: catJAM
[0:40:33] UserGonn: BatChest
[0:41:02] Hq32oL: their hands must hurt
[0:41:03] imaugment: You nailed it
[0:41:07] imaugment: my names The Rock
[0:41:18] imaugment: @BfMDevOuR ?
[0:41:20] CadhlaShuckle: @chromodar frankly I can't remember anyone else on the team rn, because Tarzan overshadows them. can't say I remember anyone on the team being necessarily bad though
[0:41:22] testlum: is IWD casting all 3?
[0:41:26] MansoGanzo: catJAM
[0:41:27] testlum: or just jdg/we
[0:41:54] imaugment: Remember when dom said he would never cast because it doesn't pay enough? Must be getting desperate.
[0:42:29] CadhlaShuckle: not quite sure Testlum. sounded like he and Munchables will be doing at least We/Jdg. though it sounded like the cast said all 3 games yesterday, which sounds odd
[0:42:29] lol_vanquish: or the region that hasnt allowed co streams or stuff like this in the past opened up to him and he is doing what he enjoys.
[0:42:47] testlum: ty @KamiShuckle
[0:42:49] azaeluu: DOM CASTING TODAY Pog
[0:42:51] CadhlaShuckle: wait, are you saying, people can change their mind??? Unthinkable!!!
[0:42:53] Chromodar: @KamiShuckle I got the roster right here, icon, Light, Iwandy, and then I don't know if they play with M1kuya or Ale top
[0:43:01] UserGonn: they have the same post LUL
[0:43:03] imaugment: @BfMDevOuR ? I'm at work. :D

[0:44:17] imaugment: @BfMDevOuR I think you were meant to @Vulcan
[0:44:22] baby19526: BLG is the team that LPL spent the most money on this season
[0:44:33] Chromodar: @KamiShuckle But yeah it's nice to see Tarzan get a chance to show he was one of the driving forces in Griffin on a completely different stage. Chovy also rly good but he's not carrying his team to second place :D
[0:44:45] UserGonn: they just finished jcking off each other
[0:44:49] myprecioussosnowy: Top and JDG wins today Prayge
[0:45:15] CadhlaShuckle: @chromodar he's carrying them somewhere with the Ryze ults though KEKW

[0:46:03] Chromodar: @KamiShuckle Anyways thanks for the info, I think I'll start watch LPL more for the rest of the split. It's really fun to me to see strong teams like Suning, RNG and IG on the bottom half having to struggle :)
