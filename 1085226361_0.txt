You have BiuBiu, unofficial world champion and the tank god ready to claim his official title, and there is nothing that will stand in his way. Weiwei, the legendary jungle who knows the ins and outs of every single part of the game, ask him how much damage krugs will do to Anivia jungle at level 2 with just the starting item? He knows.

[3:51:36] TheOreoCupcake: @thechanceryz They give leway for 2 games. But the third, what if it's something like SN vs RNG which was a 1 hour game? Teams also have their own schedules.

[3:52:11] autumnrainbells: @liketearsintherain I mean they it works because it happens in different cities. If they wait for everyone then the second city would have to start late and end late in the day

[5:01:58] FeralW0lf: Chat you're cute AYAYA
[5:02:01] TheOreoCupcake: @thechanceryz Actually though but he needs more confidence and Xiaohu is probably the best top laner in the league now

[5:02:16] piaseq_99: Is there pro view?
[5:02:17] ShadeOfMidgar: @AnOldDinosaur rell fell out of the meta after nerfs made her worse than naut or leona, still picked in some situations when there's a lot of supp bans and you really want a frontline
[5:02:17] a1000islandonmyburgburg: A little behind? 🧐🧐🧐
[5:02:20] mfxx2310: Pog
[5:02:21] HumpingOnBidness: plz dont spoil for everyone but could someone whisper me what happens game 3?? cant watch this match bc work
[5:02:26] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake maybe with orianna back in meta kinda he will be better
[5:02:27] lakershomie08: @FartEezy_hun Way more than that
[5:02:28] Oroni_enby_Hijra: @cyan50 LPL is definitely above LCK and LEC now
[5:02:28] legerld2618: vote?

[5:02:39] l3vi1: @cyan50 How delusional are you? LPL is the best region and by far. Only LCK deluded fans who still live in 2014 say otherwise
[5:02:41] antityrant: tank Rakan SeemsGood
[5:02:42] marcomachia: for everyone who's on the same time as this stream, spoiler: Germany loses WW2
[5:02:52] a1000islandonmyburgburg: Whisper me spoilers pls.
[5:02:53] cyan50: @na_retirement_home Maybe, with all those koreans playing in it
[5:02:55] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake i think nuguri is a better laner in theory but xiaohu this split has been top king
[5:02:56] theseaiscalm: is this live or delayed?
[5:03:01] l3vi1: @cyan50 was MSI not enough of a reason for you?
[5:03:09] TheOreoCupcake: @thechanceryz Orianna ain't getting buffed any time soon
[5:03:10] XzyleXL: @marcomachia i hate u how could u spoil it
[5:03:10] nanasemaru1988: ?
[5:03:13] FartEezy_hun: @lakershomie08 according to a b3tting site, current time is 12 mins and 37 secs in game by the time I type it
[5:03:18] jackkiekkk: 
[5:03:21] Tadekkkkk: this chat XD

[5:03:35] 911army: Ghost> Jackie Love
[5:03:35] ChickenDipper123: LCK cultists KEKW
[5:03:35] TheOreoCupcake: @thechanceryz I mean in theory, Nuguri is the best top laner in the world but this split, Nuguri was broken when he faced Xiaohu
[5:03:40] a1000islandonmyburgburg: Big delay szn
[5:03:42] AnOldDinosaur: if ur an english viewer, yes this is live
[5:03:58] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake yeah nuguri is having some mental problems i think.. he needs to get confidance back
[5:03:59] samxdxdouo: Jackie LUL
[5:04:00] TheOreoCupcake: @thechanceryz It's too dangerous because you have no pressure in the early game even against melee matchups
[5:04:02] pociteh: polar bear pog
[5:04:10] Flashhh__: This isn’t live it’s delayed
[5:04:15] mnmnmnmnmnme: monkaW
[5:04:15] LeafEyed: this game is about 11 minutes behind live rn
[5:04:17] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake maybe they would try BO in jungle?
[5:04:23] FartEezy_hun: @AnOldDinosaur but it will eventually come home :D
[5:04:25] TheOreoCupcake: @thechanceryz And Xiaohu has only been a top laner for 1 split so POGGERS
[5:04:26] a1000islandonmyburgburg: Delayed af
[5:04:27] ThaTimon: !delay
[5:04:27] Moobot: @ThaTimon Because the previous set(s) ran over their scheduled time, this match is being broadcasted on a delay. Casters have no advanced knowledge other than ban/pick. SPOILERS WILL BE TIMED OUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS SERIES, and channel point betting will be disabled.

[5:04:40] FeralW0lf: @cyan50 best players are often drawn to the best leagues tbh

[5:04:52] AnOldDinosaur: No no its coming ROME
[5:04:55] a1000islandonmyburgburg: Spoiler szn
[5:04:59] l3vi1: @cyan50 Who cares about nationality of players? Doinb is an LPL player. He made a name for himself in the LPL and so is the case for others.
[5:05:01] Aszala_: bot gap
[5:05:09] cyan50: @feralw0lf Best players are most often drawn to money :)
[5:05:10] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake i think his ban is already over... they just think tian is playing better.. which he is

[5:23:13] l3vi1: @TheOreoCupcake I think the passive is on both
[5:23:20] vortekxy: tearing up your backside :)
[5:23:21] Worldie: @Livecoach yes and it has a cooldown so you can't tecnically reapply it and re-claim it right away. It's way less strong than it seems and more of a "win more" trigger than anything
[5:23:24] Verkatoo: Tsm
[5:23:32] 鮮奶茶加珍珠: How many NA fans in chat ?
[5:23:34] Livecoach: So both have passive on them but you can only revive on the first kill Akshan gets?
[5:23:38] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake is it a race in RIOT to see who can create the most op champ lol
[5:23:42] win1loss: aphelios cs kekw

[5:23:43] mrmoonfanlord: why is channel is delayed todaY?
[5:23:43] TheOreoCupcake: @l3vi1 Yeah but if he kills the Kindred, only Karma is revived and the mark is removed from the Aphelios.
[5:23:47] Dxath44: TSM Pog
[5:23:48] theshyfansssssss: FPX > TES > EDG > Rng

[5:24:14] l3vi1: @TheOreoCupcake yeah the mark is removed from the rest who had it
[5:24:17] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake hopefully he wont be as op as he sounds

[5:25:17] JuiceTheGoose4: I really hope TES makes worlds
[5:25:24] styxx92: Aphelios no dmg LUL
[5:25:34] TheOreoCupcake: @captainkrajick But the cooldown of 2 seconds is very short though KEKW
[5:25:34] Moobot: THE LPL NOW HAS AN OFFICIAL DISCORD SERVER! Join here: https://discord.com/invite/tZBguQtcAc
[5:25:36] thechanceryz: @TheOreoCupcake yeah, it dosent seem ppl build it often
[5:25:45] Oroni_enby_Hijra: Hullbreaker is still a great item, but probably not as useful in the current meta. I can see it being super OP in a more splitpush focused meta tho
