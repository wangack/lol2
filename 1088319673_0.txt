[2:52:16] StarPlates: theshyt
[2:52:19] esportfanboy: why tf is TheShy still playing? Bring back Neny
[2:52:21] ye1l: we need to somehow convince TheShy to stay in the league when Rookie retires, IG buys Knight when he goes FA this season and Uzi joins IG and obtain a real support for him to play with
[2:52:30] g_nighttray: @jeev5 dont see a point in arguing whether a team is good or bad. quite childish in my opinion
[2:52:31] Ampher3: @JeeV5 dude its copypasta KEKW

[2:53:50] azenai24: TheShy may be a meme now but people tend to overlook or underestimate his past glory in 2018 and especially 2019 where he has the highest peak of any toplaner in the history of this game. He single handedly brought IG to worlds on his signature Vladimir . He even won LPL spring split finals MVP.
[2:53:53] jessen_jsm: theshy the underrated playerr
[2:53:54] iosyk: @aaahahahahahahahahahahaha He was carried by his team
[2:54:05] TfcMyq: bot lane isn't a threat anymore, teams can just camp theshy and they'll win through their bot lane
[2:54:06] therealjiggyjus: TheShy mechanically was insane yehh 3 years ago but he still sprints it like no other
[2:54:10] not_a_real_human_: @AzenaiFx ok cool but like its 2021 now

[3:02:19] ye1l: @skev8030 Noone aside from Uzi and maybe Bengi has ever come close to being as dominant in their role as Faker. Not a single player aside from Fakers has ever been able to claim themselves as the single best player in their role with no arguments to be made for other players,

[3:07:04] TwoToo_: rookie Sadge
[3:07:07] iosyk: @ye1l What do you mean? Playing jungle is much more than stomping a 1vs1. Canyon was the best because of how dominant his macro was, his mechanics are really good too. That doesn't mean he has to "demolish" the enemy jungler every game.
[3:07:10] TfcMyq: before any still copium chugging iG fans call me out, i used to be an iG fan as well until this split happened
