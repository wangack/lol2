[1:09:48] lujianbasti: humpty dumpty twins
[1:09:54] Blackjack30k: hey guys quick question, Does RNG auto make worlds for winning MSI or they just gained 4 spots for the LPL but doesnt auto include themselves
[1:09:54] igoutta: @rlawlsdud453 LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:10:16] igoutta: @blackjack30k second
[1:10:26] Oxymage: @Blackjack30k RNG don't auto qualify, they just secured 4 seeds for LPL.
[1:10:47] ForestWithin: they dont auto go but they just need to finish like 6th to get enough points
[1:10:47] Moobot: Catch all the LPL highlights on our Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/lpl.official/
[1:11:00] JAG_Blanc: RNG are generous. they give 4 slots to LPL and let 4 other teams to worlds.
[1:11:04] ACMastrpiece: msi had no bearing on worlds qualification just gave championship pts
[1:11:11] Blackjack30k: @Oxymage thanks, i was wondering, cus i havent heard much talk about RNG or the fact that they seem to be struggling so much after looking so good mid season
[1:11:16] ForestWithin: assuming a team with the other shit ton of points, edg/fpx win the split that is
[1:11:23] larricane: fxxk
[1:11:24] AlexCKP: so low production lol
[1:11:27] ACMastrpiece: 3 ads for stream of two guys talking guess im off to youtube
[1:11:38] Mlgyoung1: L ADS
[1:11:46] ForestWithin: if edg/fpx dont win and auto go, like TES wins the split or something, it could get really weird for RNG
[1:11:46] Oxymage: @Blackjack30k MSI seems like its been pretty disruptive to a few teams :(
[1:11:48] larricane: all ADs
[1:11:51] ozvie: what is that on the window
