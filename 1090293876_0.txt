[0:20:36] youngboysolos: 500m??
[0:20:48] d0_g0: ´Popularity value is not the same as viewers. That number taht says 1.783 million is not a reliable way of seein how many viewers are there by any means. It's more closely related to subscribers or followers
[0:21:09] elsoplatulas: weaposSrpf weaposSrpf weaposSrpf

After all the unfounded slander of him being toxic and NA not appreciating his talent, he finally makes his debut in the LPL on LNG and is now smashing all the competition. Can't wait to see him at worlds where he can smash Lophally's head in with his Graves Jungle.
