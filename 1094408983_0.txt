[2:02:45] carryme40: @jackeylovesgirl MSI is enough for me, especially they had to beat the current world champion DK.
[2:02:48] eisenhuth1701: @carryme40 so you also would say That Ghost and beryl are the best bot in Lck bc they won titles? I wouldnt bc Its about the perfomance of Players Not titles

[2:55:08] ye1l: I still can't process the fact that Rookie was arguably the best midlaner in the world in 2020 summer and now in 2021 summer it looks like he shouldn't even be playing in the LPL
[2:55:22] Er0yzer: @szechuan_pandas i would barely say JDG are still a good team, they had some REALLY iffy drafts lately
[2:55:26] rebelbxtchboy: i love listening to my kids hit instruments in the basement
[2:55:28] carryme40: @szechuan_pandas RNG is the favorite against all of them. Only FPX would be a slight favorite over RNG at this point.
[2:55:33] Er0yzer: and kanavi can only play from ahead

[2:59:16] ye1l: honestly of the current perceived top 4, RNG, EDG, FPX and TES, I think FPX is the most likely to disappoint. I feel like EDG and RNG are way more consistent and with TES you kind of expect them to be inconsistent
[2:59:25] carryme40: HOT TAKE: RNG WILL TAKE A TOP 4 SLOT . currently 10th place.

[3:01:03] Flashhh__: RA WILL LOSE THIS SERIES

[3:02:52] szechuan_pandas: @baneviper Crisp is clearly not the consisent, Doinb and Tian are the only consistent players

[3:12:23] szechuan_pandas: @ye1l so since we are arguing at this topic, i just did a quick research, based on KDA Xiaohu is leading with 10.7 KDA with 82.1% kill participation he is clearly the number 1 TOP and followed by flandre 4.3 KDA Ale and Breathe tied at 3.5 KDA and that is based off KDA

[3:13:50] szechuan_pandas: In Kill participation Breathe is at 8th with 65% and Xiaohu is at 1st with 82.1% which is insane

[3:14:03] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l Honestly, KDA doesn't give a good insight. It also depends on what you play and how the team plays. EDG is 10-2 or something so of course, good KDA.
[3:14:08] autumnrainbells: @pixelperfectz They have douyu in Korea?

[3:15:50] szechuan_pandas: Golds per min Xiaolaohu Xiaohu and Nuguri are top3 with Breathe at 4th, and CS per min Xiaolaohu Xiaohu and Bin top3 with breathe at 7th
[3:15:55] ものべの: That blue hair is to die for
[3:15:55] pluginho_: 2-0 BLG MARK MY WORDS
[3:16:05] pixelperfectz: @autumnrainbells idk men HAHAHA i dont live there HAHAHQ
[3:16:06] ye1l: @szechuan_pandas That's because RNG doesn't move without Xiaohu. Breathe plays on his own a lot. Breathe has only had 2 bad games this entire season and he's won lane 90% of the time. He has just been way more consistent than Xiaohu/Nuguri/Bin this season
[3:16:08] TheOreoCupcake: Xiaolaohu played 2 games
[3:16:10] szechuan_pandas: Breathe is clearly not in best Top player discusiion

[3:16:56] ye1l: @szechuan_pandas It's pretty hard to not be 1st on gpm and CSM when you have your support and jungler and midlaner hovering your lane every game
[3:16:58] 4tlanti5: okey
[3:17:04] adorebel42: what even is this RA draft?
[3:17:08] ものべの: honestly idk why FPX even imported Nuguri, they'd do way better developing xiaolaohu

[3:17:22] szechuan_pandas: @ye1l if he won lane everytime then why is his Damage per min and percentages are at 8th and damage taken are bottom in the LPL

[3:18:34] AIexanderrr: RA DRAFT KEKW KEKW
[3:18:38] ye1l: @szechuan_pandas the teams play differently. Fakers stats was pretty bad at Worlds 2017, but nobody would question the fact that he was far and away the best player at the tournament. Stats don't mean shit. JKL's CSM in spring was subpar but his GD@15 was literally double compared to any otherr player with 1K GD@15

[3:19:38] Holtyy7: who won rng vs up?
[3:19:40] szechuan_pandas: @ye1l Not cuz team playing differently, in teamfight, you either do dmaages or tank damages, breathe has neither, he is solid player, but this split Xiaohu has became the best top laner
