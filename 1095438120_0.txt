[0:17:22] ziosevielspezel: fpx got that
[0:17:34] ziosevielspezel: 2-1
[0:17:47] irlgigachad: LPL's wealth of talent is getting pretty serious, there are 5 teams in the LPL that can win worlds imo, not show up and qualify, but actually win it all
[0:18:20] bingobongon1: RW WILL WIN PEPEGA
[0:18:54] ziosevielspezel: not really i would bet on fpx or edg
[0:19:09] brainchan7: pepeJAM
[0:19:13] ziosevielspezel: not others
[0:20:03] afleot: @aaahahahahahahahahahahaha not really, it‚Äôs either EDG or FPX, the rest are known for choking and being coin flipz
[0:20:08] irlgigachad: yeah fpx edg are the in form they don't need to rise to their peaks, but imo SN, TES, RN have the capacity to reach the peaks and hold it needed to win worlds
[0:20:22] SteveIrwinJR: bust down
[0:20:24] irlgigachad: RNG*
[0:20:40] jaase94: lebronJAM
[0:21:17] ziosevielspezel: i forget about RNG they are dark horses
[0:21:27] irlgigachad: even though SN didn't finish the job, they showed its very possible to surge at the perfect time and meta change
[0:22:24] irlgigachad: RA - LNG - JDG, I'm not entirely convinced by them yet
[0:22:38] kmtunning_xD: yeh yeh yeh
[0:22:46] kmtunning_xD: theshy the best
[0:23:03] irlgigachad: maybe in 2018

[0:24:53] SteadyBoom_YAKA: dear casters, thank you
[0:24:55] irlgigachad: i fear SN are this years V5 where most people view them as the true best 4th team, but due to how the playoff bracket falls they get KO'd by someone like RNG and miss regionals
[0:24:56] rsampang: all we do win
[0:25:33] yDerickADC: karsa looks like a famous model in China
[0:25:35] bossnno: most people dont have a 4th team

[0:30:56] irlgigachad: imo the strongest 4th team for a region in a given year was 2016 KT
