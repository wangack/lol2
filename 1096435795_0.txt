[6:35:04] atreidesblue: thanks
[6:35:32] FeralW0lf: i think given what clearlove achieved in his career, he at a minimum deserves a series to shake of any stage rust. And another series or 2 to show if he can really compete with the modern day players at the top level. But LOL community loves to kick people when they are down so i doubt it Sadge
