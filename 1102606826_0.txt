[5:16:26] TheOreoCupcake: @lakershomie08 I'm here all the time and yeah, they have been beating everyone but except for EDG, which top team did they face? Strong, sure. Best in form rn after FPX, Probably. Not good enough to win the split or worlds.
[5:16:30] Xeeh: @faker__94 the only joke here is you underestimating LCS.. you will see when TSM win worlds

[5:17:28] NJLsensei: RW playing the same draft? Jebaited
[5:17:33] lakershomie08: @TheOreoCupcake You're basing this off what? Form is all that matters. FPX is going to lose to EDG in the last match of the split
[5:17:52] yelboss2: Now after money first 2 maps WE starts to play seriously
[5:17:54] TheOreoCupcake: @lakershomie08 FPX > EDG.

[5:21:24] Mechafanboy: LPL's volatile enough that top teams lose against bottom teams all the time, what makes you think the first seed is actually the best team here? :P
[5:21:32] Xeeh: just sucks im stuck watching these bad plays because LCS matches dont start for 9 more hours
[5:21:33] lakershomie08: @TheOreoCupcake Agree to disagree

[5:21:59] autumnrainbells: @Xeeh LCK is on next door
[5:22:14] yelboss2: @xeeh you can't wait 9 hours damn
[5:22:27] TheOreoCupcake: @lakershomie08 If it was the FPX that lost to BLG and the RNG that beat EDG, it could go either way. But generally, FPX has looked better than RNG this split. Regionals exist so even if RNG bomb out of playoffs, they can go to worlds.
[5:22:29] lakershomie08: @Mechafanboy Exactly
