[1:59:13] ziosevielspezel: teams that give players enough break will be top
[1:59:16] Hardlessdaimio: indeed
[1:59:20] bgijy1: 12 hour workdays with 2 days off amonth. Yeah, you'll be better, but It's not worth it.
[1:59:21] Guifee: kinda hard to separate when your hobby is also your work

[1:59:58] mhlxer: @Pirrtschi bro they turned their hobby to living
[2:00:00] TheOreoCupcake: @Dethrey They pay a lot. That's one reason why the Great Korean Exodus was sparked by the LPL
[2:00:08] Pirrtschi: @yamatos_sister i also have to study 8+ hours a day for 1 year to get my law finals
[2:00:10] bgijy1: @carryme40 they don't even have enough tome off to answer silly auestions

[2:00:30] refereetodd: @baneviper thanks man
[2:00:34] dlhoagland23: @Munchables thank you my girlfriend maybe ex now shit on it. I mean that movie ranks up there with training day
[2:00:35] Dethrey: @TheOreoCupcake I can see what u mean if korean players are playin in the LPL taht would suggest the contracts are paying really good money for top tier talent
[2:00:36] ModesTTa: this is md3?
[2:00:40] gabrrrir: haha le ye
[2:00:41] yun_0409: why dont EU teams train more pressure ?

[2:00:43] dandolod: tbf if you want to be the best in every field you have to work hard, so I don't judge them
[2:00:44] Pirrtschi: @mhlxer still imo its important to do something different like sport as a compensation for playing 12+ hours
[2:00:44] carryme40: @bgijy1 too busy winning lpl and msi titles, that sucks for them.. they need a vacation.
[2:00:45] LmaoLp: @Dethrey korean exodus was sparked by the dissolution of sister teams, per riot changing rules.

[2:01:08] TheOreoCupcake: @Dethrey I think Deft and Pawn in 2015 was paid like 1.2 million dollars a year or something.
[2:01:09] Hardlessdaimio: @gunblade0409 because eu has worker rights KEKW
[2:01:16] carryme40: SO CALLED IT, CRYIN ROBBED AGAIN. NEVER GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVE.
[2:01:16] Pirrtschi: @dandolod its not about that, in their free time they dont do fun stuff as you heared they play even more or just sleep

[2:02:09] Pirrtschi: I wonder if they have plays like for example in minute ... we do that this, if the wave is in that position etc
[2:02:09] dlhoagland23: @Munchables if you shout out Hitch i may shit my bed
[2:02:13] Dethrey: @TheOreoCupcake hmm i wonder if its 1.2 mil of USD or 1.2 rmb? hmm I will have to try to find some info on their contracts
[2:02:22] LmaoLp: @Dethrey there used to be the masters/champions circuit, each team had a sister team. after the rule change, there was a sister teams worth of players culled for every team as they had become surplus to requirements.
[2:02:25] hoyyyyaa: @perch3 nope
[2:02:29] using_user: @carryme40 @CognusNA our upbringings and life experiences are what shapes up.
[2:02:31] ljpnb66: Fnc best eu team
[2:02:36] Pirrtschi: na pro games are anyways dying

[2:03:18] Dethrey: @TheOreoCupcake that is good money in China, solid stuff, love to see the plays get paid like that. huge respect
[2:03:25] thoughtfulcoconut: @pirrtschi they don‚Äôt. That would be a waste of practice. But they do have ways of accomplishing certain things
[2:03:26] papayasmithy: RA draft 4Head
[2:03:35] Pirrtschi: @garbalen1 no they suck in international events

[2:03:47] lllnothinglll: RNG wudi
[2:03:47] carryme40: RNG 2-0 here would exceed my expectation, I would gladly take a 2-1 win to be honest.
[2:03:48] ljpnb66: Ns is the best team in the world
[2:03:48] Nara_Kouji: @gooby_pls16 I mean, because these guys practice until falling asleep is the reason Korea and China have the most World Championships. They train harder and take it really seriously
[2:03:48] garbalen1: TL looked sharp too
[2:03:53] L__7: randylBoing randylBoing randylBoing
[2:03:54] TheOreoCupcake: @Dethrey Yup, pretty sure. It was said according to an ex pro player when it happened. Deft was surely not gonna play for 200k a year back in 2015. He was the best ADC in the world back then KEKW
[2:04:05] garbalen1: ty for your prediction o.0
[2:04:11] SkepticID: TSM AKA "Throws Six Matches" is a North American team known for their questionable play and inability to win a game. They are currently found in Gate 06 of the Shanghai Pudong Airport making up excuses for not winning a single game at Worlds.

[2:58:24] TheOreoCupcake: @carryme40 Yeah, that's a bad argument right there. You're on the winning team but doesn't mean you outperformed any other mid laner. The game can be a bot diff but doesn't make the midlaner good.
[2:58:26] carryme40: @mayzser only because uzi is retired...

[2:59:36] carryme40: here is my argument: if winning lpl and msi titles don't make you the best mid laner in the world, then winning don't matter. I do not care how many flashy plays you do, show me an msi or world title pls.

[3:00:06] jamespac123: @omgHmm ssw 2014?
[3:00:11] TheOreoCupcake: @carryme40 And winning doesn't matter.

[3:00:28] SwissCake: @jrazzzz yes
[3:00:43] kenguin35: do we know why the game was so early today
[3:00:44] Plehta: @carryme40 yep thats why bang was os much better then uzi, and why piglet was better and why ruler was better too, makes sense thank u
[3:00:46] schlafmuetze18: Rng won its was not in script so we can wait now 2 hours KEKW
[3:00:58] TheOreoCupcake: @phoenixdream1 Malzahar doesn't play the map? Galio does. Malzahar pushes and just stands at mid. Galio needs map knowledge. Malzahar doesn't need shit.
[3:01:00] ÂÖ©Ê¥•Â∑°Êü•Èï∑: what issue for 2hr?
[3:01:05] SwissCake: kenguin35 schedule changes due to typhoon screwed up a lot of stuff

[3:02:11] TheOreoCupcake: @fazed343 Weekends have 3 games.
[3:02:12] azhfall: they probably didn't think that RA will be destroyed early.

[3:02:21] ziosevielspezel: its pointless to compare past teams to the present not only the mechanical prowess of players has improved but there have been a lot of changes to the game itself
[3:02:22] SwissCake: Although tomorrow is 2 games
[3:02:33] TheOreoCupcake: @carryme40 I gave my reasoning for it. Galio plays the map. Malzahar doesn't.
[3:02:42] SwissCake: Thursday will be the next day for 3 series
[3:02:46] PoggiesWoggies7: nah take care of ma boi jackey pls :)

[3:20:54] loadingerrors: @liketearsintherain logic invalid.
[3:21:26] loadingerrors: games don't have to be pay to win to be enjoyable.
[3:23:13] liketearsintherain: if you dont enjoy p2w strat then you shouldnt choose f2p games to play. they need to make money somehow
[3:23:17] thechanceryz: Yep cok
[3:24:57] loadingerrors: @liketearsintherain lol imo certain p2w games don't last long, look at wow for example, had a great run now is a dying game, because they added a feature where you can buy tokens to buy anything you want.
[3:26:10] loadingerrors: although i dont like pay2w for games, i still play certain games because they are fun, and i enjoy grinding for stuff in games.

[3:28:16] using_user: Huh, Doom Metal on LPL... interesting...
[3:28:17] NicolNanami: why is there such a large gap inbetween games
[3:28:39] using_user: @NicolNanami 56k modems starting up
[3:29:05] fazed343: cuz rng vs RA was supposed to happen ealier then a typhoon happened
[3:29:06] using_user: they take a while to boot up, just bear with them
[3:29:23] mugiwaratny08: Well LCK for the mean time
[3:29:54] using_user: I think someone was trying to make a phone call as well, so they need to wait for their parents to finish using the phone before they can connect to the servers
[3:29:56] SwissCake: ratJAM
[3:30:13] NicolNanami: ahh i see but dont games usually start at 2 pdt (30 mins from now)
[3:31:05] using_user: well, maybe their parents are calling the player's grand parents to plan out their next big birthday party
[3:31:14] fazed343: @NicolNanami yah thats what i said but for some reason its 3 today, prolly cuz its in shanghai where the typhoon hit
[3:31:19] using_user: so that could be a long conversation
[3:32:28] using_user: there was an earlier segment that the players rarely have fun, so their parents hogging the telephone line, preventing the players from connecting their modems to the internet, is a real possibility.
[3:32:40] using_user: and that would explain why there's so much time in between each match
[3:33:21] matirasa: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:33:30] using_user: because during that phone call definitely indeed their parents are calling their grand parents to plan out their next big birthday party.

[3:35:48] my_cat_typed: too short
[3:35:48] using_user: I'm pretty sure RNG won so fast because they were watching the live stream on their phones hiding on their laps under their tables, allowing them to see RA's position's.
