[1:58:20] TheOreoCupcake: @papayasmithy Nah, I mean the loss, sure. But then they didn't play JieJie both games. Even though Breathe And Beishang >>> Flandre and JieJie, I think bot is too in favour of EDG.
[1:58:20] BLG_worlds_2024: @iToaeAonBlvl meta shifted away from botlane before msi. EDG was still dominant up until 2 weeks ago

[1:59:06] „Éë„É©„É©„ÇØ„Çπ: LGD trolled the entire game

[1:59:17] katzenastronaut: whats that crackhead music
[1:59:39] TheOreoCupcake: @papayasmithy I'm excited for WE. I wasn't a huge fan of them last split but now, I just love their top jg 2 v 2. So POGGERS
[1:59:50] BLG_worlds_2024: @iToaeAonBlvl spring finals was between 2 of the 3 best teams in the world. when youre the 3rd best team in the world you arent supposed to make the finals. your logic isnt making sense

[2:01:23] iToaeAonBlvl: @theoreocupcake he literally said top team, top is 1 not 3
[2:01:31] SauGemini: FPX had a pretty rough spilt last season. But they were on fire during the gauntlet.
[2:01:37] BLG_worlds_2024: @iToaeAonBlvl the "EDG isnt good because they didnt make finals" isnt really sound logic. i have said that EDG is the 3rd best team in the world this whole time. youre making up your own narrative. 3rd best in the world is still a top team
[2:01:48] iToaeAonBlvl: @theoreocupcake nope, changing the statement after the fact

[2:02:55] TheOreoCupcake: @iToaeAonBlvl EDG are a top 3 team in the LPL.
[2:03:07] BLG_worlds_2024: @iToaeAonBlvl your whole argument is based on that you dont know the difference between "a top team" and "the top team"
[2:03:15] iToaeAonBlvl: @theoreocupcake nah, you can use the double speak you want, doesn't change the fact, "top doesn't mean top"
[2:03:30] 5headmasterp: Garvey <- WutFace
[2:03:31] floofyy1: @bolyvfr icon looking like a silver player
[2:03:36] TheOreoCupcake: @iToaeAonBlvl A top team is different from the top team.

[2:05:19] LUahLU: UZI BibleThump BibleThump
[2:05:27] TheOreoCupcake: @baneviper I'd put RA also along with WE and SN KEKW
[2:05:40] iToaeAonBlvl: @baneviper WE is looking pretty good rn tbh, I think they can go far in playoffs if they can keep it up
[2:05:41] EinsteinsParrot: uzi Kappa
[2:05:44] realtw2020: TES>sn
[2:05:53] ziosevielspezel: @TheOreoCupcake 4th team too unpredictable right now

[2:06:37] realtw2020: G2>FPX>RNG>T1
[2:06:40] TheOreoCupcake: @iToaeAonBlvl I don't trust WE's bot lane but RA's bot lane isn't very consistent KEKW
