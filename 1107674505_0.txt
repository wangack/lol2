[0:24:13] iMaybac: LCK>LPL
[0:24:17] captainkrajick: @blackgator But LPL is the most "innovative" because of how stable they are and play as a 5 unit team around objectives

[0:33:48] captainkrajick: @scottoflorida2014 DoinB easily. He's the best midlaner in the world rn. Best player in the world imo
[0:33:49] scottoflorida2014: Caps LUL  He's not even top 20 in LPL
[0:34:11] scottoflorida2014: Hes more consistent for sure
[0:34:38] captainkrajick: He 1v9s every game whether it's win or loss consistently

[0:55:01] AtomicOraion: different playstyle s

[1:04:49] Srynan: I just want less infighting at worlds this year. Like please no semis between LPL - LPL and LCK - LCK again
[1:04:49] hiuregod: DRX and Gen G were so much behind DWG last year man
[1:04:50] lummyboytellem: @scottoflorida2014 yeah i was so proud. then they split the whole region
