[0:16:58] tobi_fatalis: fpx vs edg the least hype match ever it means nothing
[0:16:59] whyisthatlamptalking: crazy to think WE can make it to worlds
[0:17:35] ayaklarinkotukokuyor: it would be pity for Knight if We can make it to worlds
[0:17:41] bossnno: i always thought they could make worlds (i also thought that at the start of last year so im actually just deluded)
[0:17:42] Twins1109: @whyisthatlamptalking why not?

[0:18:35] bossnno: @ayaklarinkotukokuyor is it not unfair for the other players on TES who are underperforming then make worlds based on knight being 1v9 tho?

[0:24:31] HottyDotty: Do these matches matter?
[0:24:32] SwissCake: NODDERS
[0:24:42] HottyDotty: I don't think they do
[0:24:42] AcexXVII: Knight 1v9 again! He's gonna be sore after that match
[0:25:00] SwissCake: @HottyDotty absolutely
[0:25:15] kukka30: @hottydotty they matter
[0:25:19] AcexXVII: Seeding matters
[0:25:32] NorthWestBest: these matches determine seeds, which matters yeah
[0:25:40] NorthWestBest: FeelsOkayMan
[0:25:42] SauGemini: Seed 1 will most likely face Seed 4 if seed 4 wins their match.
[0:25:47] bossnno: these matches matter so much bro, if we win they have less games to play in playoffs, FPX vs EDG winner doesnt have to play RNG (assuming WE win)
[0:25:50] HottyDotty: EDG FPX are already locked 1 and 2
[0:26:03] tobi_fatalis: @SauGemini it would still mean 1st place faces rng
[0:26:11] NorthWestBest: WE COPIUM
[0:26:18] CertainlySomeoneHere: but yes anyways, no mods except for me will get to see the feedback form, so you are free to go all out with feedback and criticism :)
[0:26:27] SauGemini: @tobi_fatalis RNG will be seed 5 if WE wins
[0:26:27] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[0:26:30] tobi_fatalis: stop hyping edg vs fpx, both teams want to lose to avoid rng
[0:26:34] NorthWestBest: northwOm all out
[0:26:43] kukka30: which team may face RNG 1st or 2nd?
[0:26:45] SauGemini: Meaning 2nd place would be the one playing RNG
[0:26:48] SwissCake: ratJAM
[0:26:50] tobi_fatalis: 1st series is very important yes , second one is the opposite of important
[0:27:12] SauGemini: If WE wins then whoever wins game 2 will avoid RNG 1st.
[0:27:16] AcexXVII: WE win they get 3rd seed and knock RNG back to 4th?
[0:27:20] tobi_fatalis: both fpx and edg will not try hard and will hide allstrats
[0:27:21] bossnno: if WE win both teams want to win to avoid RNG
[0:27:26] tobi_fatalis: both fpx and edg will not try hard and will hide all strats
[0:27:36] kukka30: damn Let's go WE
[0:27:40] SauGemini: @AcexXVII RA is 3rd seed btw.
[0:27:47] puff400: lebronJAM lebronJAM lebronJAM
[0:27:58] AcexXVII: Oh forgot about RA.... hehe
[0:27:58] kukka30: @saugemini it's RNG I think
[0:28:03] HottyDotty: Ok...So give me the logic why TES would want to try
[0:28:04] bossnno: if WE 2-0 they are 3rd seed @SauGemini
[0:28:11] SauGemini: RNG is 5th atm
[0:28:21] kukka30: oh
[0:28:24] Martin527: peepoHey
[0:28:30] SauGemini: If WE loses then RNG goes up to 4th
[0:28:41] Scarzard: is this lpl finals?
[0:28:46] bossnno: a lot rests on first match
[0:29:28] bossnno: @Scarzard its the last day of regular season, playoffs havent started yet
[0:29:49] HottyDotty: Can TES move up to #6? Or are they forced to play the first round. So...Why would TES even try this game
[0:29:59] SwissCake: lebronJAM
[0:30:01] Unishu: playoffs? im just here to jam ratJAM
[0:30:22] bossnno: @HottyDotty if TES 2-0 they get 6th
[0:30:22] NorthWestBest: lebronJAM damn son
[0:30:52] NorthWestBest: lebronJAM turn it up one time for the one time
[0:31:16] kukka30: if WE wins first game, then winner of FPX vs EDG will avoid RNG right?
[0:31:38] knightwares: good games today Pog
[0:32:08] darklord328na: TES VS WE should tell us a lot about current teams strength
[0:32:12] Unishu: yeh last night of the reg season and a crazy banger
[0:32:16] tobi_fatalis: 1st series is very important yes , second one is the opposite of important
[0:32:20] bossnno: actually TES have the head-to-head so if TES win they finish 6th, if WE 2-0 they finish 3rd, if WE 2-1 then WE finish  4th. so many different outcomes
[0:32:34] Í∞ÄÎÇòÎã§ÎùºÏÇ¨Î∞îÌïò: 1st v 1st kekw
[0:32:52] NorthWestBest: bossnno 5Head
[0:33:00] darklord328na: @tobi_fatalis it is important because of brackets
[0:33:05] gintokikun: 2nd match basically flex match, lets hope the stream isnt delayed then
[0:33:07] IREbina: FPX vs EDG SeemsGood
[0:33:08] tobi_fatalis: fpx vs edg make ppl think lpl is weak because both teams wont try hard
[0:33:10] SwissCake: catJAM
[0:33:18] tobi_fatalis: fpx vs edg will make ppl think lpl is weak because both teams wont try hard

[0:52:13] shinwinter: just for fun and relax .. yeah i guess
[0:52:13] AlexLikesUnicorns: @shindoten I don't like the BO1, it seems easier to win with luck / single shot tactial gimick. Don't know if itd improve anything though.
[0:52:24] carryme40: also the quality of those games are low, i rather watch my bronze elo hell games than watch 3 na game
[0:52:29] puff400: bruh 11 ads

[0:53:05] carryme40: LPL games are exciting and high quality, so people will put up with bo3
[0:53:07] Sylvanas_Windrunner1: imagine watching a BO3 between golden guardians and CLG KEKW
[0:53:14] AlexLikesUnicorns: Tbh, main reason I don't watch LCS is it's too late for me and it's mainly countdowns, leading to more countdowns to more countdowns to people talking to countdown

[3:15:32] FoZiSHKAA: Which one is the better team EDG or FPX?
[3:15:33] ye1l: Holy damn the upper bracket is stacked in playoffs, SN, TES, RNG. On one hand it's good that the regional finals isn't set in stone, but on the other hand sending RA to worlds would be genuinely cringe
[3:15:34] mrbasiccc: this would be a win for EDG
[3:15:35] KAI0: DID YOU KNOW? The Victory 5 logo contains a hidden message! If you look closely, you can see that the shape strongly resembles the letter "V". V is also the Roman numeral for 5. If you subtract that 5 from the 5 in Victory 5 you get 0, which is their winrate this split. So cool
[3:15:36] ziosevielspezel: 2-0 FPX
[3:15:38] darklord328na: Does this mean TES face RNG for a spot in top 4 semis ?

[3:17:13] Jrmyzxc: ez fpx 2-0
[3:17:38] ye1l: @darklord328na Yes, LNG, SN, TES, RNG all upper bracket, OMG, WE, BLG, RA lower.
[3:17:40] darklord328na: @ye1l they will need to win first BO5 in playoffs for that I think
[3:17:50] a0520o: hey guys just found that FPX team uniform has a star on it.What does that mean

[3:18:19] FoZiSHKAA: @a0520o do you recommend betting on FPX or DG?
[3:18:20] darklord328na: @ye1l then wouldnt it have been better for them if they lost today they could have avoided RNG
[3:18:20] ye1l: All we know for now is that one team that doesn't deserve top 4 in playoffs will be top 4 in playoffs because of how the brackets worked out.
[3:18:28] look_pagoda: LMfao if the team win this series, they gonna be #1 , and have to play in rougher branch of playoff, i think this series gonna be who throw harder LULW

[3:19:50] oniichanaya: FPX 2:1
[3:19:53] linkseff: ANELE
[3:19:59] ye1l: @bala_roja RA is only consistent, but their peak is low compared to SN/TES. They don't deserve it more than either of those teams. RA can't beat EDG, FPX, RNG in a bo5, SN and TES can if players peak.
[3:19:59] look_pagoda: @kepzzz scripted
[3:20:02] kylertf: @xianyuwang123 then this match is just a joke right ?
