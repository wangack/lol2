[0:57:43] tikal144: honestly if there is not at least 2 LPL teams in World Semi, then LPL overrated could be a fair argument

[0:58:21] peaceboyrngwin: @lmaolp  Naah, Cube is so good
[0:58:23] kenguin35: hysterics hair!!!
[0:58:25] no_crowns_for_kings: @moomookus last year maybe but if you watched this split and playoofs he held his ground against the likes of Knight and Angel. his flexibility and giant champion pool also is key to unlocking Tarzan and for LNG to win games. He's at least 5th mid laner LPL now.
[0:58:32] LmaoLp: LNG is fantastic, just needs to work on communication, map awareness, farming, laning, vision control, farming, poking, landing skillshots, objective control, early game, farming, mid game, late game, ganking, and getting kills.
