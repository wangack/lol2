[0:21:23] bossnno: after this month bo is illegible for LPL again Pog
[0:21:54] LmaoLp: he was eligible like 2 months ago @bossnno
[0:22:11] bossnno: wasnt he suspended for 4 months
[0:22:28] LmaoLp: it was a 6 month suspension, reduced to 4 months for co-operating heavily in the investigation, reduced by a further 2 months for time he had already spent suspended by his team
[0:22:53] LmaoLp: iirc june 7th or something was when he was eligible to play again
[0:23:35] LmaoLp: fpx just didn't want to because there's a huge anti-bo sentiment in china, because they view his whistleblowing as being entirely self serving - i.e bad optics for them
[0:23:54] schlafmuetze18: pepeD

[0:25:01] ものべの: Bo was by far and away the best jungler in the LPL, the community is throwing away a huge talent by having anti-bo snetiment
[0:25:10] LmaoLp: and yes, at the time he was suspended, bo was in contention for best jg
[0:25:27] bossnno: bo is getting imported to NA because of the anti-bo sentiment
