[0:16:22] Hirakai: i think t1 will win 3-2
[0:16:23] Hume5: @zedog19 true NA has more views every time
[0:16:24] AtomicOraion: T1 bot lane looks better but Damwon wins top side
[0:16:28] goblinguy01: @captainkrajick Not true xD. We have a few AHQ and TPA players. FoFo, GreenTea and a few other low card players who ended up OP coaches
[0:16:30] tobi_fatalis: Jammies pepeJAM
[0:16:33] captainkrajick: @zedog19 I think at this point Brazil has more fans+viewers. Even LFL has almost same views as NA

[0:17:18] karimcool3: tbh last time Canna did a really good job playing weakside against damwon that's why they won
[0:17:18] zedog19: @captainkrajick I dont really know the stats but for sure NA orgs invest more money and LCS have more parteners
[0:17:28] tobi_fatalis: Jammies pepeJAM
[0:17:31] LmaoLp: any chatters remembering that one solo LGD JIAYOU guy back when we had live audiences. :)
[0:17:44] LmaoLp: every game man, every game. love that guy lol
[0:17:48] AtomicOraion: LCK has the lowest investments probably
[0:17:52] goblinguy01: @captainkrajick 6/8 Play off teams had LMS players. LMS was the first to crush Korea, WE, and Moscow 5 in S2/3
[0:17:52] JustinLaurel: @biootoxiin Yes
[0:18:05] captainkrajick: @zedog19 Maybe they have more resources but they don't have any results. Brazil needs more resources but they're producing results viewship-wise anyways
[0:18:08] goblinguy01: Remember LMS beat LCK for world title lol
[0:18:11] speghitti: Chat do you get much rewards from watching live?

[0:19:54] zedog19: @captainkrajick Riot doesnt really care about the skill gap  they care only about money , they will only care if all NA teams dont win a single game 1-2 years in a row
[0:20:00] AtomicOraion: LPL best music LCK best production and staff
[0:20:04] speghitti: @captainkrajick Yeah, I know. I just don't really keep up with anything outside LCK or World's tbh.
