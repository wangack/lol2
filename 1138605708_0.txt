[5:44:19] 7winkle7oes: hey MOD, is there difference between War of Spatula and TFT mobile?

[5:44:57] M012345678: @twinkletim Not sure I don't know TFT well
[5:45:17] 7winkle7oes: @twinkletim cool ~
[5:45:19] SwissCake: Also unsure
[5:45:20] henpeckedeel84: Pog
[5:45:24] Guifee: @gradeient what did they censor in thresh originally? chains?
[5:45:36] imuellgrabi: dont think theres a difference bc for me it looks the same
[5:45:41] gradeient: War of Spatula is a modificated version of TFT by tencent i think
[5:45:44] Timdoo12: who is WE playing tomorrow?

[5:47:41] Guifee: redeemed leo 3 is Pog
[5:48:20] austinzangg: FROZEN LUL
[5:48:30] 7winkle7oes: how many players play this game? roughly
[5:48:39] suty60: holy pog
[5:48:42] M012345678: @twinkletim Not sure it came out a week ago
[5:48:51] 7winkle7oes: Blitz looks cool, boom boom?
[5:48:56] ShinseiChan: green bloodthirster? KEKW
[5:49:04] suty60: yep boom boom
[5:49:27] 812967874: 1mÔºåi think
[5:49:37] 7winkle7oes: Wild rift is a dead game compared to Honor of Kings though.
[5:50:28] gradeient: Wild Rift isn¬¥t as good as ppl thought, it¬¥s just the same as any other mobile moba
[5:50:34] 7winkle7oes: Crazy that a lot still prefers Honor of Kings in China, despite the difference compared to Wild rift. really makes me wonder what is the motivation behind playing Honor of Kings.
[5:50:59] Sagaiba: their launch was so terrible
[5:51:07] 7winkle7oes: @gradeient I tried mlbb wr and hok, I still feel like wr feels smoother etc and the quality of everything
[5:51:16] gradeient: League was made for PC.  You cannot have the same experience on mobile
[5:51:33] ShinseiChan: people just like to play marvel champs on a MOBA game I guess
[5:51:42] 7winkle7oes: im still searching for the hidden reasons that citizens go for Honor of Kings. wish me luckk
[5:52:42] kviner13: that's a one dead chat
[5:53:12] hiimdaosui: @twinkletim hok is built based on chinese fables/ancient stories/chinese cultures. also many people don't play league
[5:53:14] gabrielvieira10: RightÔºü
[5:54:08] Sagaiba: same thing with WO2, people won't care if there are better graphics, gameplay or communities in other MMO, they're too invested in WOW they must continue to feel justified
[5:55:25] xrogue_redx: after seeing how mobile players play i respect everyone that t plays tft through mobile
[5:55:40] 7winkle7oes: @Sagaiba I think ur point stands here. it makes all the sense
[5:55:53] M012345678: Pog
[5:56:02] teischente: Pog
