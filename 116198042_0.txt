[0:32:48] BLG_worlds_2024: @Rumblextristana, hillary had more votes than trump LUL
[0:33:44] FishRoeSoup: @Derr143 then why trump became the president
[0:34:15] BLG_worlds_2024: @FishRoeSoup, because america is dumb and has a system in place where they value each state instead of each person
[0:34:44] BLG_worlds_2024: @FishRoeSoup, 1 vote in wyoming is worth the same amount as 40 votes in california
[0:35:45] FishRoeSoup: @Derr143 lol thats interesting, how do they calculate the value of each state
[0:36:24] FishRoeSoup: @Derr143 or like what determines the value
[0:36:28] BLG_worlds_2024: @FishRoeSoup, its supposed to be based off population.
[0:36:36] Gunerdrag: @yungzilean HeyGuys
[0:37:44] BLG_worlds_2024: @FishRoeSoup, hillary had 65,000,000 votes and trump had 62,000,000 but trump won states that have votes that are worth more value so he won 306-232
[0:38:45] BLG_worlds_2024: @FishRoeSoup, its supposed to keep small areas from deciding the entire election because half of the population of the county lives in just a few cities, but this election proved how busted it really is LUL
[0:40:50] FishRoeSoup: @Derr143 aha so they get votes base on the size of actual geographical area
[0:41:02] chrisrox22: LMAO
[0:42:33] BLG_worlds_2024: @FishRoeSoup, not really, its mostly based off population but its really not very accurate. i will link you to something really fast

[9:28:43] konanbarbarian: bb going to see nb3
[9:28:43] iversonxie: Smlz is the best jinn player, not worse than bang or sneaky

[9:31:51] iversonxie: EDG is not bad, but unfortunately Mouse's dad passed away during the worlds, so he had to get back to China, EDG has to let Korol play
[9:31:59] TheFriedPig: Is that coach Chris????
[9:32:44] loyalweir: UZI need to make a change for the team, this is not the s3 royal club
