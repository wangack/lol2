[0:14:15] bakavic: FL is back to 100% green on the bar
[0:14:24] Darkaros: peepoArrive is it time to become a reaction streamer since Doogs reacted to your reaction
[0:14:27] Sonatta: first light is fine, windsward has a war
[0:14:35] Sluggs_: @itmeJP nobody declared war on us for NL but we are at war for tomorrow ith place we just took
[0:14:35] Xenflux: being able to have the territory you worked for be put in jeopardy so easily is disheartening
[0:14:39] Redeyedmonster: Its like Planetside. You do a lot of work for it all to go away when you sleep
[0:14:42] bakavic: ww is shaping up to be a 3 way fight
[0:14:43] Sonatta: purple is messing with monarch
[0:14:45] SMonTwitch: FL is back to 100% green because they didn't have the ability to declare war, but WW is back into a war
[0:14:51] Koroido: Just like irl Sadge
[0:14:53] BlazeRom: yeah that's weird
[0:14:56] Penoxi: The PVP quest looping is so stupid
[0:15:05] BlazeRom: i literally had to just wait in a pvp area to finish it
[0:15:20] freaktechnik: gaming is meaningless?
[0:15:30] Kurozakai: No MCU Crew today?
[0:15:40] BlazeRom: KEKW
[0:15:53] SMonTwitch: Yeah, purple was running up WW influence and no one on the green side bothered to fight it so we have a war tomorrow
[0:15:53] sindacrof: turn down for what?>
[0:15:54] NoorElBahrain: @Kurozakai no
[0:15:56] woschdvendetta: so killing players doesn't reward anything?
[0:15:57] Nyx187: I am still angry i spent all day yesterday crossing the world to level up my faction at level 20 for a listed as level 20 quest and find out i cannot do it until 24
[0:16:02] BlazeRom: badly thought out it seems
[0:16:04] KelticNight: an existential MMO LUL
[0:16:16] woschdvendetta: yikes ijpONO
[0:16:18] NoorElBahrain: Kurozakai you can check the mcucrew twitter account for the reason
[0:16:20] NoorElBahrain: !social

[0:16:22] yrvengalied: ijpHI JP and Chat
[0:16:29] Respawned__: like warfront timer % in bfa wow
[0:16:34] BlazeRom: this prob resulted from the community demanding PVE
[0:16:40] NoorElBahrain: @yrvengalied ijpHI
[0:16:42] ItsNoxid: there is another pvp mode at lvl 60
[0:16:51] ShaggyTh3Dog: Sounds like the problems WvW in Guild Wars 2 had
[0:16:54] Gyranthir: help you get to 60, is the why. make it feel like you're progressing whilst warring
[0:17:02] Mavrikhuntr: Does the 50v50 feel like the big BG from WoW?
[0:17:03] OmmaNOM: do they have long standing goals like seasonal rewards for the factions?
[0:17:09] Penoxi: Yeah, grind another 60 hours of Corrupted Portals to hit 60 KEKW
[0:17:18] afreak10: what do u get from levels ? just high gear score ?
[0:17:25] NPSJason: @itmeJP is it a situation where the game will be fun until people figure out the optimal way to do things maybe?
[0:17:27] Gyranthir: ellohime is like 56
[0:17:30] Redeyedmonster: Side note. Pretty stoked for Battlefield :)
[0:17:31] notoriousnub: what do you do at 60?
[0:17:32] Saunt: Its an mmo let it take awhile
[0:17:38] Kurozakai: catJAM
[0:17:40] dio_lima: when the exp boosters drop the grind will make sense Kappa
[0:17:57] Saunt: so most MMOs
[0:18:01] BakaOniiChan_: Did you win the war? I couldnt watch that late. @itmeJP
[0:18:02] Nyx187: zombie with yellow glow or red glow or blue glow
[0:18:15] Redeyedmonster: thats fair
[0:18:20] GivTater: reminds me of the fate grind when ARR came.out.
[0:18:22] afreak10: most MMO got story or actual PVE
[0:18:25] Darkaros: @BakaOniiChan_ yeh they did
[0:18:26] Crimsonomi: i dont understand the problem it's exactly the same in wow
[0:18:27] woschdvendetta: i even grew tired of clearing out GW2 maps back in the day, and it had the best questing experience ever for me
[0:18:35] Penoxi: I hate how we're not even past week 1 and the leveling has turned into players running in a one big clump doing portals
[0:18:38] Altair900: also the stag anus glands
[0:18:46] Saunt: Region Boar slightly different colour
[0:18:50] DangerRangerRex: FFXI...
[0:18:53] Collected1: an issue is the game switched focus from PVP to PVE 1.5 years ago and so what we've got is a mixed bag of content
[0:18:53] Sluggs_: that qujest sucks
[0:19:01] afreak10: ton
[0:19:16] JeedanJune: wait till you find the Omega Lynx
[0:19:17] notoriousnub: @itmejp what is there there to do once you hit 60?
[0:19:18] Rowwek: new world has terrible mob variety.
[0:19:23] BlazeRom: they probably wanted people to focus on the pvp
[0:19:23] constipated_wombat: The entire game has like 10  different mobs
[0:19:30] RaylightFGC: RaylightFGC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[0:19:31] Mavrikhuntr: Unless you're Eve Online. You EMBRACE the Spreadsheet
[0:19:33] ghostsofcarcosa: New World is to bare and the spread sheet is just open
[0:19:38] GraveSalad: As someone who doesn't play MMOs this all sounds the same to one another. Granted you can be reductive and say every FPS is just clicking on heads while holding WASD keys
[0:19:44] Penoxi: NW is a spreadsheet. We just don't have a wowhead for it, yet
[0:19:58] NoorElBahrain: just play an actual spreadsheet like CK3
[0:19:58] Redeyedmonster: i like my story MMOs. FFXIV and SWTOR
[0:20:04] Omid18: I think this is a game to play until level 35 and then stop. typical mmo launch.
[0:20:14] GraveSalad: yea, I realized the delay was answering it as I typed....
[0:20:19] easy_n: So Eve Online got it!
[0:20:28] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1445067369802522631
[0:20:41] Koroido: Wonder if duels will be a thing
[0:20:48] Collected1: it will be interesting to see where NW is in 12 months
[0:20:49] ItsNoxid: no one being flagged sucks
[0:21:04] BlazeRom: cowards
[0:21:07] Penoxi: 1-5 PvP fights have generally been really fun and engaging, but the mass PvP is just gravity pulls and AoE heal circles
[0:21:07] Miros__: They didn't even get creative with the lore or world.... there are no races except humans, and no enemies except "dead humans",  "infected humans", and "Wildlife".
[0:21:08] NPSJason: @NoorElBahrain The best part of learning GS games is when you find a new slider, move it slightly and destroy your entire civilisation NODDERS
[0:21:17] Saunt: I wish there was more to the Roleplay aspect
[0:21:19] SlipCrit: i prefer the FF14 spreadsheet of "join pvp, barely try, get cool fashion
[0:21:29] JaseLeland: I'm playing for the harvesting/crafting, I'll never flag LUL I think the combat is mediocre at best
[0:21:32] Guomi: Flagging for pvp is always just invitation to be ganked by entire opposing side
[0:21:34] WDForty: some ppl don't enjoy open world pvp, but want to do the wars
[0:21:35] emaraldragon: they didn't hide the copy/paste well and i think they intentionally extended the "grind" to give them time to build more end game stuff maybe
[0:21:39] GraveSalad: would having PVP always on fix things or is it more of a case of needing to cover up the "spreadsheet" better?
[0:21:39] TehMud: I'm waiting for Metroid Friday
[0:21:39] Darkaros: is it time to embrace fishing
[0:21:42] NoorElBahrain: @NoorElBahrain ijpH the dangerous numbers ijpH
[0:21:49] JaseLeland: fishing is fun too
[0:21:50] Guomi: Fishing belongs to sips Dark
[0:21:53] Collected1: install windows 11 of course
[0:21:54] LeroyGankins: (try melty blood:TL) ijpCULT
[0:21:55] OmmaNOM: I wish it had archeage style trade pack deliveries and other stuff to spice up the game
[0:21:58] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[0:21:58] kepopaper: it's like you already experience everything just upper scale in numbers
[0:21:59] JaseLeland: oh yeah, win11 tomorrow
[0:22:16] NoorElBahrain: How about fall from platforms in satisfactory like I'm doing these?
[0:22:19] NiceGuyNick: @itmeJP So wednesday bf2042 100% happening?
[0:22:32] Saunt: I wish they would test expanding the combat by letting some buffs stay when you swap weaponsd rather than losing them
[0:22:37] pc2400: its officially announced bro @TheNiceGuyNick
[0:22:38] NiloxofAsgard: Noor ijpBOOP
[0:22:38] GraveSalad: the real end game is always fishing

[0:22:42] DerfOnTurf: Satisfactory! ijpPOGGERS
[0:22:45] NoorElBahrain: @NiloxofAsgard ijpBOOP
[0:22:47] NPSJason: like with most mmo launches, it will be interesting to see how it changes in the next 18 months
[0:22:50] Miros__: @GraveSalad if pvp was always on, a large group of people would never have played the game (me included). Getting ganked by someone twice your level while trying to learn the game is never fun
[0:22:53] gimpx0r_cpa: @itmeJP did you see the Marvel Gamora What if tweet?
[0:22:55] NiloxofAsgard: Aros stripKiss
[0:22:59] Sluggs_: they had to build pve from the ground up in 1 year, they need a lot more time and maybe an expansion before it could be good
[0:23:01] NoorElBahrain: tomorrow is BF pre-load ijpHI
[0:23:01] Darkaros: Nilox lawlmanKiss

[0:24:01] BobbiTheDragon: didnt alan wake have a alot of dmca muisc?
[0:24:04] blissfuldan: His Halo video got me hyped
[0:24:09] GraveSalad: @Miros__ I meant more in terms of like lvl 60 forces always on PVP or something. The main point I keep hearing is that the main unique aspect of NW is the PVP yet it seems like people have figured out a lot of ways to bypass it outside of Wars which people like
[0:24:19] Guomi: Remastered either bought the rights for it or just replaced Poets of the Fall wholesale
[0:24:41] Nakkipasta: Gundam POGGERS

[0:26:29] pc2400: Would halo be top 3 on steam though?
[0:26:31] DDPrime: They'll shut down my servers on Azure to run Halo

[0:30:13] its__fil: Was pretty stuttery for me with GSync, had to go to fixed refresh rate
[0:30:37] Masterpug13: Is this going to be on the GeForce Now thing when it launches?

[0:41:14] Rocyournoc: in my experience it was terrible
[0:41:15] Sluggs_: it only took destiny 4 years to actually make shotguns not the best for this season
[0:41:15] bearonvonbear: shotguns will only ever be op or up
[0:41:20] DangerRangerRex: It would work in SWAT
[0:41:21] De4dMaNz: nah even close it was 2-3 but shoots quick enough its fine
[0:41:23] MakzinD: It takes 2 shots even with a headshot on the first hit

[0:41:45] Altair900: pump shotty and the magnum are coming some time down the line AFAIK
[0:41:53] NPJoe: It removes shield on 1 shot hit, so shoot once and melee worked in close range

[2:49:18] EyevisLive: no community guids in game
[2:49:19] RauTheLegendary: It has suggested items, they're usually not great but fine for beginners
[2:49:21] The_Faceless_Void: this is a small indie company they diont have that
[2:49:22] P4ste: it's not as good as dotas
[2:49:23] Proph89: @itmeJP You can reset your auto attack by pressing your W right after your normal auto
[2:49:23] breadgravy: not nearly as indepth but yes it's similar.
[2:49:23] Skyform: there's a 3rd party app that'll give you builds vs but the game has a generic version

[2:49:35] raptorscream: does this character really have the same passive spin that Axe has?
[2:49:35] afreak10: u get banned
[2:49:35] Wurth: Lawlman is consistent diamond and gmart is usually plat; several of Strippin's friends are pretty solid and they are fun banterers
[2:49:38] xenorifle: gg ez KEKW
[2:49:38] Kymix: KEKW
[2:49:41] nerscyllathrilla: Strippin uses the Blitz app, which gives you build
[2:49:44] Shunkan: They kind of added recommended but you should use a site for higher ranks
[2:49:47] 14neo: 'member when Strippin got chat banned? PepeLaugh

[2:56:44] ceilss: Riot is so Riot.... CCan't even allow cam control NotLikeThis
[2:56:46] iDeadlyFlow: galeforce is fun
[2:56:51] nerscyllathrilla: A couple of champs' abilities damage towers, but most of them are AA buffs
[2:56:53] obscuredvey: lets give good advice that actually works for him in tutorial yes?
[2:57:00] DD_The_Shmey: @Kymix wife privlage, Does Aureylian play league?
[2:57:05] pandalisk9: very few abilities damage towers, mainly abilities that buff your next basic attack
[2:57:06] maldredblake: hold up jp can read?? alright maybe there is hope for strippin
[2:57:09] murasaur: camera is unlocked :O
[2:57:09] ElSpartin: we're free
[2:57:09] Jukettaja: Weird
[2:57:10] Mrshilka: @DD_The_Shmey she works for Riot now
[2:57:11] MostlyHype: nice
[2:57:13] WeeMr_Goodcat: backseating starting in 3...2....1....
[2:57:16] osakey: Soraka no pvpWhy
[2:57:17] Jukettaja: So strange
[2:57:18] prrrah123: freedomm
[2:57:19] Gorn_Vernaleer: @DD_The_Shmey she works for riot
[2:57:20] JohnyRallo: no
[2:57:20] xenorifle: no
[2:57:20] koanchap: @dd_the_shmey work for riot NODDERS
[2:57:21] Joebeezer: no
[2:57:21] Skyform: no
[2:57:21] ElSpartin: nope
[2:57:22] nerscyllathrilla: No
[2:57:22] johnfive21: nope
[2:57:22] Eplesh: no
[2:57:23] Nihrz: no
[2:57:25] Rlchibi: no
[2:57:26] Nemesisnick33: good thing the enemy team decided not to respawn KEKW
[2:57:26] iDeadlyFlow: @obscuredvey so u were saying ? XD
[2:57:27] AtlaST_tv: then holding space will lock the camera to you
[2:57:27] Slittyfungus: nah minions tho
[2:57:29] DD_The_Shmey: oh ok
[2:57:29] Joebeezer: almost no abilities do
[2:57:30] nerscyllathrilla: Only a fwe abilities damage towers
[2:57:31] Skyform: @itmeJP only a few champs dmg towers with skills
[2:57:32] Rocyournoc: do any abilities do damage to towers chat?
[2:57:32] Ahoy_NATO: no, VERY few abilities damage turrets
[2:57:33] Phatstacks27: sivir winning the game
[2:57:33] TamboTv: w gives attack speed though
[2:57:34] RlDennis: W increases your attack speed though I believe
[2:57:35] johnfive21: almost no abilities do
[2:57:45] Shoaron: on-hit abilities do dmg to towers
[2:57:45] KizamaruTheDK: Soraka NotLikeThis
[2:57:47] obscuredvey: @obscuredvey Lots of advice was being spammed besides that
[2:57:51] Eplesh: w is a stim
[2:57:54] Jukettaja: Forced tutorials are kind of upsetting when you know what you're doing
[2:57:54] JohnyRallo: space bar recenters camera on you but doesnt fix it
[2:58:06] nerscyllathrilla: Ez, Ziggs, and a few champs with AA buffs are the only ones that can damage towers with abilities off the top of my head
[2:58:10] Kidween: itmeJP You can buy items with right click from the shop instead of clicking on "purchase"
[2:58:13] Axellooper: @Rocyournoc Direct damage to towers? Almost none. Some abilities that buff auto attacks can translate that damage to a tower on hit.
[2:58:17] Eplesh: yes :)
[2:58:19] Jukettaja: lol
[2:58:19] JimB0b0: bots are really trash
[2:58:19] NiloxofAsgard: time to go lurk, i can't watch league, don't wanna fall back in that hole ijpMONKA later folks ijpLOVE
[2:58:20] Ahoy_NATO: yeah, you could end if you want
[2:58:20] ElSpartin: you pushed bot up super hard so yeah
[2:58:21] WeeMr_Goodcat: 6+
[2:58:23] MostlyHype: fair warning... Skins have gotten VERY pretty
[2:58:26] nerscyllathrilla: Space
[2:58:32] ceilss: 1 KEKW
[2:58:35] osakey: F1-5 for allies I think?
[2:58:37] Eplesh: that shouldnt be the case
[2:58:38] Jukettaja: Yeah you don't really have Control Groups
[2:58:38] xenorifle: f keys look around the map
[2:58:40] Zohaas: @Jukettaja Forced tutorials prevents new players from messing up. If they accidentally unlock the camera, then they have a bad experience
[2:58:41] koanchap: you could rebind it probably
[2:58:45] breadgravy: 100% winrate
[2:58:45] raptorscream: Riot design
[2:58:48] 14neo: @NiloxofAsgard in actuality you'll see more reasons to not go back to it if you tune in no? PepeLaugh
[2:58:50] TasPlays: Lots of locks in tutorial
[2:58:54] JimB0b0: yeah
[2:58:55] 14neo: @NiloxofAsgard but adios either way ijp7
[2:58:55] MostlyHype: old game
[2:59:03] nerscyllathrilla: Smol indie dev
[2:59:04] CJBulldogs: indie company
[2:59:05] JimB0b0: the client thing is obnoxious
[2:59:07] xenorifle: taskbar up top WutFace
[2:59:07] Deadlysin12: what's got you playin league
[2:59:07] koanchap: it is engrained into the game
[2:59:09] maldredblake: the client is older then dirt its rough xD
[2:59:10] schwed15: they are a small indie company
[2:59:10] Jukettaja: @Jukettaja I mean forcing a new account to play tutorials if you've played the game for years
[2:59:12] Skyform: @itmeJP there's also no champs with super micro with totems and shit like DOTA
[2:59:15] raptorscream: Small Indie Dev
[2:59:17] Nogardknight: cuz the game and account client are still separated
[2:59:20] Axellooper: A: Old Game. B: All Riot games will launch through this client soon (well, a new version, but still)
[2:59:20] murasaur: man, imagine if they preloaded the map by having a fullscreen client
[2:59:20] zero0nine009: 9..
[2:59:20] ceilss: There are no "controls" in this game, cause you always control only one unit. (there are 3-4 exceptions, but they are not relevant)
[2:59:21] Joebeezer: taskbar up top is superior
[2:59:22] zero0nine009: 9ö9
[2:59:24] zero0nine009: ö.
[2:59:25] WDForty: yea it was causing a weird capture screen warp earlier, gone now tho
[2:59:29] Nogardknight: spaghetti code from 10 years ago or something
[2:59:35] xarantur: i think they said that the new client that they're making is gonna remove that kick out
[2:59:36] ElSpartin: dorans is a very good start item
[2:59:39] Ahoy_NATO: yeah small company, unfortunate they run the largest game in the world, make for tough situations /s
[2:59:39] archer61: you can right click to purchase
[2:59:40] maldredblake: its def. the standart unless its a heavy harass lane
[2:59:40] JimB0b0: ward is best
[2:59:41] LegendsOfBobby: yellow ward
[2:59:44] LegendsOfBobby: its freeeee
[2:59:45] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:59:46] WDForty: yea the technical debt on that launch must be crazy
[2:59:50] johnfive21: yellow trinket is just a free ward
[2:59:52] Archangel3003: Dorans good start as you get life steal and extra damage to minions
[2:59:52] nerscyllathrilla: Not buying the ward item... smh
[2:59:54] schwed15: always take a yellow ward
[2:59:57] Eplesh: yes
[2:59:59] LegendsOfBobby: oh ya it didnt show my bad
[2:59:59] MostlyHype: it gives it to you automatically
[3:00:02] JimB0b0: @itmeJP you can switch that lock keybind
[3:00:04] iDeadlyFlow: this ppl dont even play league lol
[3:00:05] FnC_Sunshine: holding space is temporary lock
[3:00:06] Nihrz: ya it gives you it if you leave bass
[3:00:06] TasPlays: Yellow ward recharges
[3:00:07] schwed15: yea it gives it to you auto if you forget it
[3:00:09] nerscyllathrilla: ah, it auto takes it now
[3:00:10] Deadlysin12: yeah when you step out of base it will automatically if you dont purchase
[3:00:10] RlDennis: Yeah, you get it automatically as you walk out of base
[3:00:10] Skyform: @itmeJP ADC shouldn't be getting extra ward coverage unless you're ahead. like reveal hidden ward.
[3:00:12] nerscyllathrilla: interesting
[3:00:14] m3rcer: its free on a cd
[3:00:15] LegendsOfBobby: i didnt know it gave you it auto now thats cool....
[3:00:16] Ahoy_NATO: yeah, if you hold space you center on yourself, most players just tap Space intermittently
[3:00:16] Shunkan: Probably a bug
[3:00:17] L0c0st: guys you get it auto when going out of base
[3:00:20] MostlyHype: A shows attack range
[3:00:22] Jukettaja: lol

[3:00:48] murasaur: back to the tripple stack
[3:00:49] Skyform: brands support and dmg is nuts

[3:00:55] MageDaemon: Streamers decided he's support now
[3:00:56] velphi: i didnt know you play league
[3:01:00] nerscyllathrilla: Brand is best against multiple champs, so bot lane he goes
[3:01:04] maldredblake: listen if he just kills the entire enemy team that counts as "supporting"
[3:01:07] Axellooper: RIP cannon
[3:01:08] murasaur: ashe mid, yep...
[3:01:08] xarantur: Yeah Brand has turned into Lich now

[3:04:28] galdamesh: @itmeJP swap your casting to quick cast in settings, it's better to learn that first
[3:04:31] InLatorIgnis: well this is a rare treat
[3:04:34] LegendsOfBobby: red ward reeeeeee
[3:04:37] Zyntho: @LiteralZero not wrong FamilyMan
[3:04:43] nerscyllathrilla: Quick cast is preference
[3:04:47] simiid: @itmejp twiter started to have issues
[3:04:48] ragrath: No, fuck quickcast
[3:04:50] Kymix: no difference guys
[3:04:53] Jukettaja: Information overload
[3:04:55] Ahoy_NATO: yeah its like the little lightning bolt under the keys
[3:04:59] tglenn: has Worlds started?
[3:04:59] raptorscream: Quick casting, what's this LoL? ohyeah
[3:04:59] EyevisLive: jp comes from dota and sc2. he might not like quick cast
[3:05:00] maldredblake: there are a few different options its def. a thing you wanna feel out
[3:05:01] Eplesh: I really like quickcast
[3:05:02] Tornados_: There is s very good third party app called Blitz if you want to look it up, really helps with talents and items
[3:05:04] cleansock42: quickcast is worth learning
[3:05:06] IllusionistTrixie: can you even set quickcast out of client?
[3:05:09] thrillhouse451: Put your giblets in the gonad JP!
[3:05:10] 45pringles: yea quick cast is really usefull
[3:05:14] Archangel3003: quick cast lets you see the ability path/area doesn't it
[3:05:18] Zohaas: @itmeJP Fun fact, this lane duo was played at worlds in 2016
[3:05:20] Archangel3003: usefull for sure
[3:05:20] Eplesh: cant imagine playing the game without quick cast personally, but its a preference thing
[3:05:24] RlDennis: I can't get used to quickcast except for a few champions. If you can use it though it's pretty nice
[3:05:26] maldredblake: lmao that ashe bot
[3:05:34] nerscyllathrilla: I found quick cast to be useful for some abilities on some champs and useless for others
[3:05:38] nerscyllathrilla: Its a preference
[3:05:39] 14neo: quick cast is the devil's temptation, don't sell your soul to it ijpD
[3:05:57] DeffsNotErik: since when does JP play league?
[3:05:58] cleansock42: @Archangel3003 if you hold the button yes but its mainly used for quick use
[3:05:58] DerionMinster: @14neo cohhLUL
[3:05:59] Eplesh: Godlike pog
[3:06:00] Darkaros: I turn on quickcast on things that require little to no aim on Dota and Smite

[4:37:09] Paintcanz: welcome to league spaghetti
[4:37:10] Pickedaname_: One of the reasons I stopped playing this game was because of how  1 ally int'ing would basically waste 20 minutes
[4:37:19] Skyform: you need to change it for next game
[4:37:21] TrueAmbience: might be bugged due to resolution scaling
[4:37:26] schwed15: I think if you alt tab out of the client and then click back in it fixes it

[4:49:03] nerscyllathrilla: Heal Ghost is probably better for now
[4:49:05] ElSpartin: heal ghost until you get flash imo
[4:49:06] schwed15: you want ghost heal
[4:49:09] nerscyllathrilla: Or Heal Barrier
[4:49:11] Disb3liever: Need a movement ability

[4:49:17] Tronix_604: wifey with benefits LUL
[4:49:19] Ozoaken: ghost heal is decent until you get flash
[4:49:20] zucroh: ghost/exhaust
[4:49:20] Slittyfungus: gotta have movement
[4:49:24] king_pie_xvi_zu: keep ghost
[4:49:25] ExtraGreasy: You need an "Escape" ability, typically Flash, but for now take Ghost
[4:49:28] Shoaron: always Flash on F
[4:49:33] 4thwrldmrshl: or flash barrier, flash is your get out of jail free card. pretty much everybody takes it
[4:49:37] Hese_1: @Stephen_34 resist the temptation LUL i still play aram but still you shouldnt play this game
[4:49:38] corantic: ofc JP plays MF
[4:49:40] br4nd0nh347: inb4 he presses ghost thinking it's heal
[4:49:42] Shoaron: always Flash on D*
[4:49:48] Fireema: Yis brother
[4:49:49] 4thwrldmrshl: Explaining the new champs is going to be difficult
[4:49:53] Ozoaken: flash belongs on f
[4:49:53] Slittyfungus: i member when MF was new
[4:50:00] SaraScorpion: Flash'D

[4:50:17] lbartolo: She changed
[4:50:18] SaraScorpion: Kay N
[4:50:19] RauTheLegendary: She was changed a lot since you played
[4:50:21] 4thwrldmrshl: Irelia is *not* the same
[4:50:23] EyevisLive: she got reworked.
[4:50:36] 4thwrldmrshl: they took her kit and said, remember how this was simple and easy, nah fuck that
[4:50:37] Gabriev666: hello JP & chat ijpHI stripLuv
[4:50:38] tyree_sanada: Irella is OP now
[4:50:41] MostlyHype: she still does the dashy thing
[4:50:42] galdamesh: Irelia my perma ban
[4:50:43] xarantur: she got reworked but now she's just stupidly good
[4:50:47] EyevisLive: pro irelia clips are a treat
[4:50:48] FiddTech: irelia is one of those champs that goes 35/1/20 on the enemy team then goes 0/66/0 when she's on yours
[4:50:49] Slittyfungus: spawn boost
[4:50:53] 14neo: @Gabriev666 ijpH
[4:50:54] randomdutchdude: i want old irelia back :(
[4:50:59] Nathanisms: Kayn solos raptors
[4:51:06] Slittyfungus: what a chad no leash
[4:51:07] Hese_1: @4thwrldmrshl she still rekts you very easily and is still easy to play LUL
[4:51:11] murasaur: yeah, looks like he starts raptors
[4:51:12] AnagramOfChaos: minimap left dfq?
[4:51:13] tyree_sanada: @fiddtech yea not me cause I know how play her
[4:51:16] Ozoaken: he'll start raptors
[4:51:17] xarantur: sort of
[4:51:19] osakey: For the most part, yes
[4:51:19] lbartolo: Yes
[4:51:20] Skyform: yes
[4:51:22] MostlyHype: 2 week patch cycle so no
[4:51:22] Nathanisms: I mean the meta always changes
[4:51:23] EyevisLive: because of the changes not really
[4:51:24] Rezz284: kind of
[4:51:24] corantic: Did Stripping bribe JP to play League
[4:51:25] Shoaron: like 80%
[4:51:25] zucroh: @itmeJP you can disable chat if you want in interface
[4:51:25] Mujona: No entirely
[4:51:26] Gabriev666: @14neo stripHug
[4:51:26] Slittyfungus: oh fuck yea
[4:51:27] Sidewinder3121: this is more of PJ game to be honest
[4:51:29] JohnyRallo: its figured
[4:51:30] Hese_1: yes
[4:51:32] WakoJakoDK: yea but the Meta changes all the time
[4:51:35] aceofspades3018: patches changes the champions
[4:51:36] Vaan_GG: sort of but because patches are every 2 weeks meta changes
[4:51:36] zucroh: not really
[4:51:39] Jukettaja: JP about to shake up the meta
[4:51:40] ExtraGreasy: Kind of, the developers are super good about constantly changing things to make it fresh @itmeJP
[4:51:41] darkrhulad: You guys gonna invite Gmart? apparently he is playing as well
[4:51:42] tyree_sanada: No
[4:51:42] 4thwrldmrshl: @itmeJP meta changes aren't nearly as severe as dota
[4:51:43] Slittyfungus: constantly
[4:51:46] NiloxofAsgard: chat i think they'll lose this one
[4:51:48] NiloxofAsgard: stripSip
[4:51:55] tyree_sanada: The best players still build bad and etc
[4:51:56] MostlyHype: yearly big change, roughly monthly champs rotate out
[4:51:58] xarantur: Pre season is my favorite cause people go insane
[4:52:01] Tremert: They do it all the time so you cant have fun always
[4:52:01] EyevisLive: but riot decides the meta. rarely you see a meta created by players
[4:52:02] RauTheLegendary: Overall game strategy is pretty straight forward right now, but meta changes every season
[4:52:02] Hanshino: no, it's dependant player skill
[4:52:03] terribilta: every patch the meta changes pretty much
[4:52:04] Slittyfungus: u take that negative attitude eslewhere
[4:52:06] eLMaQ: Riot patches very often, so meta is little fluid
[4:52:10] Slittyfungus: this is a winners chat'
[4:52:18] galdamesh: uh oh a player that dodges not in a straight line
[4:52:20] Hese_1: @itmeJP season 10 so one season before this was the item changes
[4:52:23] 4thwrldmrshl: riot does plenty of filler patches too just so they can patch every 2 weeks
[4:52:24] Nathanisms: the birdmans her boyfriend
[4:52:25] ValdorWold: If you get hit by 3 of the feathers, you get rooted
[4:52:27] Ozoaken: warding bot bushes can be good if enemy laners keep going in them
[4:52:31] L0c0st: and they can root you if 3 feathers hit you
[4:52:32] sapu_123: she is a birdperson
[4:52:36] Kymix: and Seraphine is the Skarner killer
[4:52:40] Tremert: Well, top champions are always the strongest
[4:52:40] Archangel3003: Xayah is super fun
[4:52:52] MostlyHype: def unflip
[4:52:52] 4thwrldmrshl: because you used to play starcraft probably
[4:52:53] AndyMillz: Wait…. Don’t do it JP
[4:52:56] EyevisLive: i ahve clicking on minimap disabled for that very reason
[4:53:01] schnoodly: bottom right is disgusting
[4:53:02] 4thwrldmrshl: and its in your brain that hte minimap goes in bot left
[4:53:03] schnoodly: that's why
[4:53:03] vin88x: Because DotA? ;)
[4:53:04] DerfOnTurf: bottom left master map race

[4:54:04] AndyMillz: @itmejp put your cam in bottom Right nothing will be there and you won’t be hiding data
[4:54:33] Slittyfungus: oh no
[4:54:37] murasaur: this combo is nasty
[4:54:40] DerfOnTurf: flashy things happened SeemsGood
[4:54:45] 4thwrldmrshl: it only roots if 3 feathers hit you on the way back
[4:54:46] stormingg: each section on the hp bar is 100 health
[4:54:54] MostlyHype: 3 pullbacks root
[4:54:55] zucroh: @itmeJP buy the refillable potion instead of hp potions, better value
[4:54:55] WDForty: i guess it makes sense to have the map bottom right in LoL cause you're almost always moving down left, or up right
[4:54:56] bairdman: 3 feathers have to hit you to root
[4:54:58] ValdorWold: You have to get hit by 3 feathers to get rooted
[4:54:59] aceofspades3018: 3 have to hit
[4:55:01] MostlyHype: 3 feathers have to pull through
[4:55:05] Ozoaken: if you get hit by 3 feathers when she recalls them you get rooted
[4:55:07] AndyMillz: If you get hit by 3feathers it roots
[4:55:23] 4thwrldmrshl: @mods is jp cool with us explaining the efuck out of the game
[4:55:24] AndyMillz: Shove and roam

[4:55:39] shadowslayer187: for me the biggest part of getting good at the game was learning what each champ can do so you can avoid it
[4:55:46] prrrah123: Teemo oh no no
[4:55:47] MostlyHype: no
[4:55:49] Hese_1: LUL sam missing those Qs

[5:16:36] furry_wolf2001b: woow
[5:16:40] schnoodly: that's a fucking bonkers mechanic
[5:16:41] ShockingIce: @ShockingIce this apparently "apparently they withdrew their BGP route advertisements and they can't shell in because they can't route to the network and they can't get into the building because their doorknobs are synced to the corporate LDAP"
[5:16:42] raptorscream: lol, Game gives you bonus to jungle, does it hold it's hand too? :D

[5:17:06] Sethlaus: BGP = how routers tell other routers where stuff is.
[5:17:06] Crosseye_Jack: They are what big ISPs and Sites use to tell other ISPs who to get to their network
[5:17:07] furry_wolf2001b: how the heck would one know about that mechanic when one start to play?'
[5:17:10] raptorscream: @itmeJP DNS were deleted for Facebook, and everything is down
[5:17:13] Madracah: oh Sam isnt streaming ? wanted to duo stream ;/
[5:17:16] Crosseye_Jack: how*
[5:17:18] TheRedTyrrant: BGP is Border-Gateway Protocol. Is a routing protocol. Basically tells routers where to go to route traffic on the internet
[5:17:19] Devlind: I kinda want all so I'll media to go down for a week.

[5:17:58] EyevisLive: @itmejp cam is on top of the map
[5:17:59] Lindobu: geometry beholder
[5:18:00] Pickedaname_: Jungler isn't "required" but it helps the entire team level/gain gold + having a roamer invreases the likely hood of kills

[5:19:49] Shaolin91: @Shaolin91 I see league hasn't changed much in all these years then LUL
[5:19:52] Ozoaken: @Shaolin91 ive had a kayn support in one of my ranked games, so anything goes at low level KEKW

[5:20:34] Shoaron: you didn't heal the Vel LUL
[5:20:34] Lionhardt544: @TheInstinctive iirc people started jungling him, and then Riot was like "ok fine" and reworked him so his kit made him make more sense as a jungler
[5:20:36] Slittyfungus: we can't see map so watch lanes

[5:22:41] Darkaros: @Gorriliaz dunno? last night's influence push on First Light fizzled out so nothing involving Schmeckles

[5:23:34] Lindobu: @Puffywiggles better than the moonstone meta that was really dumb
[5:23:44] Nenod: I generally dislike LoL but I admit they have the best mobile app
[5:23:48] Darkaros: ya they must've messed up the 10% requirement for companies
[5:23:48] NiloxofAsgard: @Gorriliaz prolly nobody had the 10% needed to declare
[5:24:01] Puffywiggles: Like Kayles ally heal does like 5% hp and people hit you twice and chunk 50% hp. Its super underwhelming
[5:24:01] Ozoaken: @Puffywiggles sona seraphine bot lane both with moonstone provides insane healing
[5:24:02] Gorriliaz: hahah awesome LUL
[5:24:11] Wolfplank: do they still have  RAM or ARAM (whatever its called)?

[5:24:31] Gorn_Vernaleer: @Wolfplank ARAM, yes
[5:24:37] Paintcanz: just a note, it's a good idea to use your E before your ult so you can slow them and get more waves off
[5:24:40] Wolfplank: cool thanks
[5:24:42] NiloxofAsgard: i almost went to LoL website to redownload the game NotLikeThis chat elp ijpSAD

[5:29:50] Mujona: Galeforce is a great item as well if you wanna mix it up
[5:29:58] MostlyHype: supports roam at 10 a lot
[5:30:05] MostlyHype: sometimes before
[5:30:05] Koinman25: supports roam to help other lanes and drop wards after 10 or so minutes
[5:30:09] Ozoaken: roaming supports in blind pick Pog
[5:30:10] Lindobu: @14neo you're always welcome contrary to apex league runs well on me KEKW
[5:30:11] murasaur: why is no one taking dragon?
[5:30:15] galdamesh: @Mujona probably don't want to involve actives in his first few games...
[5:30:23] NiloxofAsgard: @Lindobu what would be a good build for MF in this game ?
[5:30:37] Ozoaken: @murasaur dont know why enemy isnt, but jp and strippins jungler didnt take smite KEKW
[5:30:39] Mujona: @galdamesh In all fairness, he comes from DOTA which has a ton of active items, but I see your point.
[5:30:51] OhTenGeneral: It just timed out and died
[5:30:53] Shoaron: fiora on a rampage monkaS
[5:30:53] teh_PING: it just died?
[5:30:54] QIBuS: it just died
[5:30:54] Lindobu: @NiloxofAsgard didn't check how many tankies they have if enemies are all squishy eclipse lethality build would be super good
[5:30:54] murasaur: @Ozoaken yeah, its looking weird
[5:30:54] Joebeezer: dead ward
[5:30:55] JimB0b0: It timed our
[5:30:57] PissedOffWalrus: that means there WAS  a ward there
[5:31:00] hirtza1: jp has better cs than most dia plauers nice
[5:31:11] checkmonkey: Was, not is
[5:31:13] NiloxofAsgard: @NiloxofAsgard they are all squishies
[5:31:14] 45pringles: it means it a dead ward
[5:31:18] 14neo: @Lindobu yeah i was hoping to play Apex Ranked Arenas with ya but i guess that didn't happen for that reason ijpHMM
[5:31:19] Joebeezer: JP's cs is crazy wow
[5:31:20] Ozoaken: it just expired
[5:31:26] Darkaros: Sam ijpKEK
[5:31:33] Lindobu: yeah then eclipse lethality would be best pretty sure
[5:31:55] Mavrikhuntr: roo1HP
[5:31:56] Lindobu: but at this level i'm pretty sure going for the vanilla builds is better
[5:31:56] Koroido: peepoRun

[5:32:39] Lindobu: @14neo i installed a SSD but i still run a 1 stick of ram and apex runs generally very purely on top of that had some irl stuff going so yeah
[5:32:40] Midnight4life: A death beam that does true damage if vel has 3 passive stacks up.
[5:32:48] DoctorJohn: damn

[5:33:11] Shoaron: she can be
[5:33:19] Kymix: Riven was a dragon
[5:33:21] OhTenGeneral: She's pretty feast or famine
[5:33:21] Mr_5ketch: wait why is chat top left?
[5:33:22] murasaur: in the right hands
[5:33:22] galdamesh: riven is very dependent on user skill
[5:33:23] Kymix: not a god
[5:33:25] Daikurou: riven is wholly player based
[5:33:25] Mujona: Riven is super skill dependent.
[5:33:26] Paintcanz: riven is good in the right hands
[5:33:29] teh_PING: sweeper or pink
[5:33:35] hans1234364534: control ward or red trinket
[5:33:36] Ozoaken: if she gets some early kills, yes shes a god
[5:33:37] LagoutLoud: Riven is pretty strong right now, but hard to play
[5:33:40] MostlyHype: as adc you dont want scanner
[5:33:50] HahaHazer: Riven can snowball pretty heavily
[5:33:57] Fuji_5: "scanner" is oracle lens. it's free
[5:33:59] NiloxofAsgard: as ADc usually you kep stealth wards or take the long range blue one
[5:34:04] 14neo: @14neo understandable, IRL stuff can indeed get in the way ijp7
[5:34:25] teh_PING: farm at tower
[5:34:27] Joebeezer: I mean you are 1v2
[5:34:36] Mujona: Galeforce is kinda like a second blink, but you already have a Legendary item.
[5:34:37] MostlyHype: yeah you sorta lose the right to step up when support is gone
[5:34:40] galdamesh: @itmeJP there is a blink connected to an item
[5:34:43] NiloxofAsgard: ingame
[5:34:43] PissedOffWalrus: that's in-game
[5:34:44] RobertoMaybe: in game
[5:34:44] Joebeezer: in game
[5:34:44] zucroh: ingame
[5:34:45] Onloom: in game
[5:34:46] Shoaron: ingame
[5:34:47] PissedOffWalrus: it FINALLY works well
[5:34:59] 14neo: the next bit of gaming i am excited for currently is Battlefield 2042, i am wondering if it runs well enough both performance and ping-vise ijp7
[5:34:59] uui23: you could have used a trinket in the bush to look out for it
[5:35:00] Paintcanz: when u hit lvl 12, you get flash, the best summoner spell in the game
[5:35:04] galdamesh: I don't know if it works well..... but definately better
[5:35:33] Shoaron: when running from enemies try not to get near walls unless your are going to flash over them, it will just limit how much space you have to dodge sht
[5:36:01] Lindobu: it may be counterintuitive but supports are kinda supposed to roam
[5:36:01] Mujona: Nice
[5:36:02] antroz92: Clap
[5:36:02] Koroido: EZ Clap
[5:36:03] Midnight4life: NICE
[5:36:05] CookieToniis: Clap
[5:36:10] murasaur: nice
[5:36:15] uui23: also one thing i notice from dota - lol players is they don't use their skills as much
[5:36:41] uui23: mana cost is on average lower in this game so you can use more of it
[5:36:42] NiloxofAsgard: @uui23 mana usage is much more conservative ye
[5:36:42] zucroh: well in dota you press 2 skills and are out of mana
[5:36:46] murasaur: yummy turret
[5:37:02] Paintcanz: JP, in some matchups you can build galeforce as the first item, it gives you more movement speed and a dash that deals damage
[5:37:33] murasaur: herald can be pretty nasty
[5:37:33] Munetani_NJimha: HOLY
[5:37:40] zucroh: herald doing work
[5:37:40] Munetani_NJimha: That wasn't in the game when I played!

[5:37:55] murasaur: that looks like gg''s
[5:37:55] Joebeezer: and them
[5:37:57] Ozoaken: if you destroy the nexus with the rift heralds still alive she'll dance
[5:37:57] ExtraGreasy: Yes
[5:37:58] MostlyHype: both
[5:37:59] Shoaron: on a friendly
[5:37:59] NiloxofAsgard: no heal heals you and closes lowest hp ally
[5:37:59] zucroh: yes
[5:37:59] ApathyOwl: shares it with them
[5:37:59] PissedOffWalrus: Your heal affects everyone in a radius
[5:38:00] Lindobu: both
[5:38:02] hans1234364534: you and that person
[5:38:02] hirtza1: heal hits you +1

[5:38:06] bijoushin: Its an aoe heal
[5:38:07] galdamesh: heal goes to you and the alley with lowest health within range
[5:38:08] teh_PING: aoe around you
[5:38:09] kitaooji: you + 1
[5:38:10] JeXus1985: heals you and an aoe around you
[5:38:10] captainkruste: its aoe for you and around you
[5:38:14] murasaur: your heal has a small aoe around you
[5:38:14] 45pringles: it useses it on you and the lowest heath ally near you
[5:38:17] br4nd0nh347: heals you and one other
[5:38:18] kitaooji: is it aoe ? oh
[5:38:20] Ozoaken: its uses it on you and one low health nearby ally
[5:38:20] 14neo: Nilox gonna make bank ijpPOGGERS
[5:38:26] uui23: heal is not aoe, it just heals you+1
[5:38:31] Kokoianer: it's only one other person from what I know
[5:38:32] JeXus1985: you will; it just has a cooldown
[5:38:32] Shoaron: heal is normal for ADC
[5:38:33] Slittyfungus: prob not
[5:38:34] NiloxofAsgard: @14neo ofc i am stripSip
[5:38:34] zucroh: i think it's changed to focus the lowest hp around you ?
[5:38:35] Paintcanz: you will always have heal
[5:38:36] Baludor: Heal and flash is usually meta for ADC
[5:38:40] Heasimitore: back in my day it healed one person and that was it..... I think...
[5:38:41] Slittyfungus: for her
[5:38:43] Midnight4life: its down for 183
[5:38:43] PissedOffWalrus: you'll normally take heal + flash
[5:38:43] epicshoo: damn, chat is so good with explaining things Pepega
[5:38:46] murasaur: back to buy
[5:38:46] Shoaron: Flash/Heal is the normal ADC summoner spells
[5:38:46] uui23: heal is the goto pick for adcs
[5:38:47] Heasimitore: and we liked it
[5:39:00] Munetani_NJimha: wow why did it explode?
[5:39:02] Joebeezer: F
[5:39:04] Ozoaken: heal is useful on adc much of the time you take heal and flash as your summoner spells
[5:39:04] Shoaron: KEKw

[5:39:33] Paintcanz: or use control wards
[5:39:40] murasaur: I bet she has vision in your jungle
[5:39:56] legendary_albert: you think Evelynn is scary now days? anyone remember old Evelynn? XD prema stealth + stun + huge health recovery from kills thanks to old R XD

[5:42:54] Fuji_5: yeah there are a lot of snowflakes in League who have no grit
[5:42:58] OhTenGeneral: 12/3

[5:43:08] epicshoo: no reaction ijpMAD
[5:43:11] legendary_albert: @galdamesh actually people buy accounts when their old ones are banned. I actually think unranked shouldn't have lots of smurf players
[5:43:13] NiloxofAsgard: hey Lukerzz_ ijpBOOP

[5:44:06] hirtza1: wonder if JP will do a coaching series for lol with some high elo streamer
[5:44:08] zucroh: nothing will help him survive eve
[5:44:11] Paintcanz: or just quick silver sash
[5:44:13] hirtza1: like he did for strive

[5:50:20] Catzumo: hes talking about using flash chat
[5:50:22] MostlyHype: Flex is for teams
[5:50:23] crawds: aram is actually fun
[5:50:25] sckeperz: ranked flex means you can have 1-5 people in your party
[5:50:25] kaberite: flex is for bigger teams
[5:50:26] omniwizardry: @murasaur Yeah thats what I though, the poke with thz double Q would have done more, thx for answer
[5:50:32] hirtza1: soloq is 1 or 2 flex is 1 2 3 or 5 players

[5:50:50] Koinman25: depends on your luck
[5:50:51] hirtza1: it's the only one that matters
[5:50:52] zechetto: It's probably worse
[5:50:53] nakata545: only if you take it seriously
[5:50:53] Shoaron: eh
[5:50:53] kitaooji: sometimes
[5:50:54] Lindobu: perhaps
[5:50:55] crawds: team base game? yup
[5:50:56] Kersenka: Depends on the teammates
[5:50:56] murasaur: sometimes

[5:51:01] Shoaron: uselly its ok
[5:51:01] osakey: It's really no worse than Dota, but not better either
[5:51:02] omniwizardry: Blitz will put your summoner skills like flash auto, also you can set up blitz to tell you what to level
[5:51:03] king_pie_xvi_zu: sometimes
[5:51:03] kaberite: it hurts, but thats where men are born
[5:51:03] Kymix: 90% of the time
[5:51:05] uui23: yep its the worse
[5:51:08] Darkaros: I'm looking forward to JP learning a new League character, like Nyx Assassin or Sol Badguy
[5:51:11] uui23: its the same really as dota
[5:51:12] Zahpod: You can do it JP
[5:51:16] sageOnMain: You're about to find out, aren't you PepeLaugh
[5:51:16] MostlyHype: It takes 150 games to get to your skill level
[5:51:19] The_Faceless_Void: run it down mid at the start KEKW
[5:51:19] murasaur: some days soloQ is about as good as getting needles under your nails, somedays you find a team that is in perfect sync
[5:51:23] ceilss: soloq is the reason I stopped playing LoL and switched to PoE
[5:51:29] zucroh: it's a lot worse in low level because 50% of people there might be people who got permabanned
[5:51:29] nakata545: Same as dota but you can FF away from the worst people
[5:51:30] Midnight4life: not the worst
[5:51:31] MostlyHype: so you are underranked before that

[5:52:06] GRlVER: aram give XP?
[5:52:08] Archangel3003: If you go to your profile it tracks which characters you've used in which lane and how well you've done etc

[5:52:19] Daikurou: quests. to get rewards
[5:52:20] zucroh: missions to get currency
[5:52:20] Victo0: @uui23 aram isn't the best to learn the game tho
[5:52:20] NercesK: ijpFLURK
[5:52:27] galdamesh: yes
[5:52:28] zucroh: yes
[5:52:28] ceilss: YEP
[5:52:29] zechetto: yes
[5:52:29] OhTenGeneral: Not as much
[5:52:29] MostlyHype: Yep
[5:52:29] PissedOffWalrus: it does
[5:52:29] Shoaron: yes
[5:52:34] hirtza1: yeah but playing normals is faster
[5:52:35] nakata545: slightly less I think
[5:52:36] DerionMinster: get lux for a aram game thas nice
[5:52:37] kaberite: less but its faster
[5:52:40] MostlyHype: yes
[5:52:41] sckeperz: thats all i play period
[5:52:41] AmplifyDamage: @itmeJP u should try URF for fast EXP
[5:52:41] OhTenGeneral: People have ARAM-only accounts
[5:52:42] ceilss: some of them
[5:52:44] Archangel3003: Worlds Event is the current event and those are missions you can complete for rewards
[5:52:46] crawds: aram is much more fun
[5:52:46] uui23: @Victo0 he already has the basics because of his dota experience though
[5:52:47] Tornados_: Yes
[5:52:55] crawds: aram is less sweaty
[5:52:56] Nathrael: @itmeJP for a new player its better to play summoner's rift so you get into the mechanics of the map
[5:53:04] murasaur: @crawds some people think its more salty and sweatier
[5:53:05] HyperRypen: urf is probably the fastest
[5:53:05] hirtza1: absolute fastest is doing a 15 min end strat in coop vs ai, with double boosts can be done in a weekend
[5:53:07] Lukerzz_: try it out later, it's faster paced and you get to learn howchampions work more easily
[5:53:10] zucroh: aram is more chill, faster and you might learn champions faster
[5:53:13] TheInstinctive: 80 games or smth
[5:53:16] MostlyHype: no clue
[5:53:16] galdamesh: i've seen people do it in a day.... but with both boosts active all the time 3-4 days
[5:53:19] GRlVER: aram is way less painful to play if I remember correctly
[5:53:19] gonelinkdead: about 18 weeks
[5:53:21] omniwizardry: Depends how much you win :)
[5:53:29] GRlVER: solo I mean
[5:53:31] ag_blues: ARAM only works if you actually know most of the champs. I think it will be confusing to someone new.
[5:53:35] Victo0: @itmeJP I think the speedrun 0->30 is around 20 hours ?
[5:53:36] kaberite: gold farming 2021
[5:53:36] OhTenGeneral: ARAM is VERY hectic for a new player.
[5:53:42] bren92: That's how they sell accounts
[5:53:46] MostlyHype: spells
[5:53:50] Mujona: You can change flash here
[5:53:50] nakata545: @zucroh learning in aram is less effective for veteran moba players like Dota players since they already have decent / good mechanics
[5:53:51] Shoaron: either works
[5:53:51] zucroh: take flash
[5:53:55] Darkaros: is fine
[5:53:57] ceilss: it doesn't matter LUL

[5:54:23] WeeMr_Goodcat: o shit, pikachu is here. this match will be electric.
[5:54:23] Darkaros: stripYum two tops
[5:54:24] Lindobu: just instalock and assert dominance
[5:54:26] Victo0: @bren92 nah, accoutn sellers just have dumb bots running hundreds of accounts at a time, they don't care about going slow with how many they level at a time
[5:54:26] omniwizardry: The strat is to lock and not say shot except /muteall
[5:54:28] schwed15: f for flash is correct
[5:54:29] AinzN: What does "ADC" mean?
[5:54:29] kaberite: d for dash
[5:54:30] OhTenGeneral: Hey, when people don't have smite, 2 tops is what you get
[5:54:32] crawds: do you get smite a lvl1
[5:54:34] Shoaron: having a jungler doesnt matter at lv10 gameplay guys LUL
[5:54:35] Noytron: no jungle hell yea baby
[5:54:36] OhTenGeneral: F for Flash gang
[5:54:38] Psomaster: I should be paying attention to my online class but this is more interesting
[5:54:38] legofreak59: you should flash at the very beginning to make sure it works
[5:54:41] Archangel3003: Oh nvm I forgot he just got it last time lol
[5:54:42] hirtza1: flash on F like a king
[5:54:42] BroqRox: I remember back in the day me and my friends went all 5 tanks, for the lols KEKW
[5:54:43] Joebeezer: jp solo bot time

[5:54:45] MostlyHype: attack damage carry

[5:54:48] Zirilyth: attack damage carry
[5:54:48] afreak10: attack dmg carry

[5:54:50] ceilss: AD Carry = Attack Damage Carry
[5:54:56] zucroh: @nakata545 that is true,i do think fastest way to learn champions is to play at least 1 game with them
[5:54:59] epicshoo: Hmm big if true
[5:55:01] OhTenGeneral: Nowadays they call it Marksman but ADC is the classic
[5:55:02] murasaur: any dick can
[5:55:02] kaberite: wow it sounds so weird when its not shortened
[5:55:02] MostlyHype: ADC = Bot
[5:55:04] Dr_b00m_b00m: No predictions.

[5:55:12] BroqRox: modCheck game?
[5:55:19] Tronix_604: ad = physical damage, ap = magic damage
[5:55:20] ceilss: ADC
[5:55:21] OhTenGeneral: Probably ADC
[5:55:24] OhTenGeneral: It's just easier to say
[5:55:25] AinzN: Yeah I only know Dota terms and I have never heard of "ADC"
[5:55:27] Qbush: uh oh.  no smite again LUL

[5:56:24] OhTenGeneral: Annie support. One of the best Mage supports
[5:56:26] hirtza1: it'll get a lot better in draft pick just gotta endure until then

[5:57:47] legofreak59: caitlyn has such good range
[5:57:54] OhTenGeneral: @murasaur I mean, Vel'Koz has more instances of CC but the guaranteed stun Annie gets certainly is stronger

[5:59:13] murasaur: qqeqqeeeqeqfdddddq
[5:59:27] Victo0: @RlDennis yeah, I still main annie support, same as I did since season 3, but i do'nt think it'll work in higher elos where people know not to facecheck bushes when playing against annie
[5:59:48] hirtza1: there are lots of chall annie onetricks
[5:59:55] murasaur: small indie company...
[6:00:03] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[6:00:22] Victo0: @hirtza1 yeah but they are mid now
[6:00:26] legofreak59: nice trap by cait
[6:00:26] RlDennis: @Victo0 Yeah it doesn't LUL I haven't really played her in a good while though. Used to pick her vs Yas mid
[6:00:42] OhTenGeneral: Annie thought she had AP already I guess
[6:00:44] Crosseye_Jack: PRAISE THE ADS!
[6:00:50] Altair900: hypeE
[6:00:57] uui23: cause she got the stun and the enemy adc was alone
[6:01:02] Victo0: @RlDennis she is really, really good into pyke, played against a pyke yesterday, he ended up in 1/10/1 and that's only because their jungler camped us early
[6:01:07] Krohnikal: nice wave management tho!
[6:01:07] picklegun: is u step on a trap her next shot is a crit
[6:01:10] Shoaron: sgift + right click to attack move JP

[6:01:36] RlDennis: @RlDennis Idk why but I keep picking Shen into Pyke and it just works out for me everytime LUL
[6:02:03] kaberite: what is this annie waiting for lol
[6:02:12] anthonytimmeh33: How long has JP been playing LoL?
[6:02:16] MostlyHype: Nice
[6:02:20] hirtza1: pyke modCheck
[6:02:20] Victo0: @RlDennis depending on the amtch up, i pick either annie or poppy, it's wild how pyke becomes once he can no longer dash on you or your adc because of the poppy aoe
[6:02:24] Noytron: hell yea
[6:02:24] DMGcontroll: not bad
[6:02:26] ReXoRpG: nice
[6:02:27] The_Faceless_Void: @kaberite for that KEKW

[6:02:49] kaberite: @The_Faceless_Void i mean couldve jsut went in, poked cait to 40% AND FARMED UP THE WAVE
[6:02:52] RlDennis: @RlDennis Yeah that was my reasoning for Shen at first aswell. He uses dash to cc. I use dash to counter cc LUL
[6:03:02] Kymix: LUL
[6:03:05] UsualAdam: UsualAdam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! ijpLOVE

[6:03:07] Noytron: it used to be pink xD
[6:03:08] zucroh: it was pink
[6:03:08] anthonytimmeh33: @Crosseye_Jack And did he play much then? Or is he prety much a beginner?
[6:03:08] Kymix: i never thought of that
[6:03:14] The_Faceless_Void: @kaberite but that isnt fun now is it LUL
[6:03:16] Altair900: as I am partially color blind, it looks pink to me :)
[6:03:16] anthonytimmeh33: It was pink, then reworked, but the name stuck
[6:03:17] Llwvyn: it used to be pink, then they changed it to red and players refused to call it red
[6:03:18] MostlyHype: pink top wraiths LUL
[6:03:20] ElSpartin: they should rename it pink ward but leave it red
[6:03:26] Teza_Kinoku: used to be pink
[6:03:32] uui23: hmmm i would go for galeforce in this game
[6:03:41] AlvincatX: was pink. However, red is already in use for red buff
[6:03:44] ElSpartin: nope
[6:03:44] Noytron: fuck that 1 minion in particular
[6:03:46] hirtza1: no
[6:03:46] The_Faceless_Void: @kaberite I like being sneaky beaky like and BOOM suprised
[6:03:48] Shoaron: no
[6:03:49] Oxmo_: no
[6:03:55] Crosseye_Jack: @anthonytimmeh33 Well he is pretty much having to relearn the game, but he has played DOTA in the past so he is not completely new to the gerne
[6:03:57] Gorn_Vernaleer: nno
[6:03:58] Noytron: negative
[6:04:00] The_Faceless_Void: you can walk over then and disable them
[6:04:02] BroqRox: pre-step on them KEKLEO
[6:04:10] kaberite: @The_Faceless_Void you ar etalking to a fiddle main here, so I feel you, brother
[6:04:17] hirtza1: pyke setting the map on fire
[6:04:25] Kymix: Damn, you're doing pretty decent against a Caitlyn
[6:04:34] Nathrael: @itmeJP it;s a good habit to have, when you push your wave to go use your yellow trinket in river, to spot junglers
[6:05:12] Eplesh: Is strippin still playing or is JP playing solo now?
[6:05:14] ElSpartin: LUL

[6:05:26] W_Tile: omg
[6:05:26] Victo0: @itmeJP because they wanted to do drake so they rotated on it
[6:05:27] Crosseye_Jack: @Eplesh Stripin went to raid
[6:05:28] ElSpartin: free dragon
[6:05:28] Mal2mad: JP going solo
[6:05:29] Kymix: incoming pings for where is bot
[6:05:30] anthonytimmeh33: Is this a normal game?
[6:05:32] TehMud: LUL

[6:05:36] Shoaron: leashed dragon KEKW
[6:05:36] The_Faceless_Void: thanks dead guy
[6:05:40] Eplesh: @Crosseye_Jack Thanks for answering :)
[6:05:41] Ozoaken: KEKW
[6:05:41] ag_blues: We will remember his sacrifice.
[6:05:44] Crosseye_Jack: @Eplesh He will be back in about 90 mins or so he said
[6:05:52] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP if only you had emotes you could emote over his dead body for BM
[6:05:55] Eplesh: 👍
[6:06:03] Kymix: Decent map awareness
[6:06:04] Pickedaname_: i just received a preroll ad + a block of ads 3 minutes laters
[6:06:05] Shoaron: you should try not ot back on cannon waves
[6:06:09] ElSpartin: yep
[6:06:12] zucroh: yeah
[6:06:12] ElSpartin: keep bot til tower falls
[6:06:22] The_Faceless_Void: yea
[6:06:23] TPLivewire: Yeah, not very many gank ops right now
[6:06:24] Eplesh: mid is a fiesta
[6:06:25] Eplesh: damn
[6:06:31] Kymix: double mid KEKW
[6:06:31] zucroh: you actually want to back on a cannon wave,takes longer to die
[6:06:38] hoosierdaddy000: This makes me vaguely miss LoL but not really LUL
[6:06:49] Kymix: oof you took a lot of dmg
[6:06:49] Crosseye_Jack: @IdkiPickedaName Well you sould of got them around 6 mins ago. But yeah we run ads every hour. We have little control over pre-rolls
[6:06:53] hirtza1: going bot and when bot tower dies going mid is all you need to know till master tier
[6:07:24] Hookan91: ijpHI ijpH
[6:07:25] Crosseye_Jack: @IdkiPickedaName the max we can disable pre-rolls is for 40 mins, so people are gonna get pre-rolls one way or another
[6:07:32] Hookan91: ijpHI JP and chat
[6:07:41] legofreak59: so why is that little alcove there in bot and top? i know its not old
[6:07:47] MKHEROX: is jp still playing against bots?
[6:07:50] anthonytimmeh33: for alcove gaming
[6:07:50] legofreak59: and thats its pretty recent
[6:07:51] ElSpartin: a bit, but it only really matters if you ar elosing CS
[6:08:08] Kymix: you could save a lot of mana from ot useing e on the back line
[6:08:09] terribilta: @mkultrati nope normal blind picks
[6:08:14] MKHEROX: oh nice
[6:08:15] omniwizardry: Not enough poke I would say
[6:08:16] zucroh: for outplay potential @legofreak59
[6:08:21] Gorn_Vernaleer: @mkultrati nah, this is his 3rd against real people, and 1st solo
[6:08:27] uui23: its fine to push lanes in the early game because of tower plates
[6:08:46] Kymix: annie should be roaming
[6:08:53] uui23: as long as your not missing CS either way
[6:09:02] Victo0: @Kymix annie should have ulted on cait like 5 mina go
[6:09:07] ElSpartin: good heal
[6:09:24] Shoaron: LUL
[6:09:25] Joebeezer: good try :)
[6:09:36] Nogardknight: that's why it's called flash, not blink Kappa
[6:09:36] zucroh: he thought he had blink dagger or something
[6:09:37] epicshoo: Jebaited just like halo melee
[6:09:38] PissedOffWalrus: it's a flsha
[6:09:41] Daruvik: Don't call it a comeback!
[6:09:42] PissedOffWalrus: flash*
[6:09:42] Kymix: LUL
[6:09:44] br4nd0nh347: you're learning , now you know
[6:09:44] NiloxofAsgard: it's claled flash for a reaosn stripSip
[6:09:45] ElSpartin: RIP top tower
[6:09:47] Mal2mad: Wait, turrets have plates now?
[6:09:52] ag_blues: Kinda jealous JP has so many champs to discover now.
[6:09:55] Shoaron: to far
[6:09:58] Mujona: If you want a second blink get Galeforce JP
[6:10:03] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[6:10:13] anthonytimmeh33: Dota blink is just ridiculously far
[6:10:31] DerfOnTurf: Dota blink is just right
[6:10:32] uui23: galeforce is not a blink its a dash
[6:10:33] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[6:10:45] legofreak59: welcome to league lol
[6:10:49] PissedOffWalrus: it's not lookin good
[6:10:51] Joebeezer: not having a jungler is rough
[6:10:57] zucroh: galeforce would be pretty good vs their team but game doesn't look good
[6:10:59] Nathrael: This Diana is very experienced compared to some of your teammates
[6:11:04] MostlyHype: your cs is still good though
[6:11:05] ElSpartin: yeah
[6:11:05] NiloxofAsgard: ye
[6:11:11] ElSpartin: she's got like 20% or more on you
[6:11:12] anthonytimmeh33: What level is he?
[6:11:12] Kymix: Yeah
[6:11:13] NiloxofAsgard: cait is one of the safest ADC
[6:11:18] NiloxofAsgard: and lack of jungler is very bad
[6:11:19] PissedOffWalrus: yes, but she's not as strong later in the game
[6:11:22] Joebeezer: no
[6:11:22] Nogardknight: 2nd highest AA range in the game, I think?
[6:11:22] zucroh: no
[6:11:23] hirtza1: no
[6:11:24] Shoaron: no
[6:11:29] ToeKnee147: ya i think why sam wanted you to try her
[6:11:33] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1445067369802522631
[6:11:40] uui23: this is why i suggest aram since you have dota experience
[6:11:47] epicshoo: no but people die when they're killed
[6:11:49] hirtza1: cait is insanely hard to play optimally
[6:11:56] uui23: it gives you a faster experience on what heroes can do
[6:12:04] zucroh: ashe would be the best for new players i would think
[6:12:30] zucroh: isn't there a similar hero in dota 2?
[6:12:39] Nightshaft25: i think ashe is too passive for new players
[6:12:40] 45pringles: how do you like my guns stripStare shock and aaaa
[6:12:43] uui23: ashe is basically drow
[6:12:45] Joebeezer: I love the casual taunts
[6:13:04] nakata545: Most basic adcs aren't different enough for there to really be a best for new players
[6:13:15] ilionheat: How come jp started playing league? Did he lost a bet?
[6:13:26] Darkaros: !whylol
[6:13:26] itmeBOT: https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1444862232140070912 JP's doing it out of love. ijpLOVE
[6:13:30] DerfOnTurf: Strippin made him do it
[6:13:43] anthonytimmeh33: Kraken Slayer, yuck
[6:13:43] Nightshaft25: and adc is pretty diffucult for a me
[6:13:55] Nightshaft25: for a new player
[6:13:57] DerionMinster: @DerfOnTurf id think its the other way around cohhLUL
[6:14:00] nakata545: ADC depends on the supports
[6:14:00] DerfOnTurf: What does adc mean?
[6:14:01] ilionheat: thanks guys <3
[6:14:02] hirtza1: yeah
[6:14:03] adrianlibri: too serious
[6:14:04] NiloxofAsgard: in low elo no
[6:14:04] Shoaron: yes
[6:14:05] afreak10: ye
[6:14:05] legofreak59: yea i think so
[6:14:07] Kymix: nah
[6:14:08] 45pringles: yea
[6:14:11] Darkaros: @DerfOnTurf attack damage carry
[6:14:11] Burkody: a lot more screechhing
[6:14:14] PissedOffWalrus: yes, plus it assigns roles so you'll have a jungler
[6:14:17] Daruvik: sweat-fest depending on ranking
[6:14:18] nakata545: not really until high elo
[6:14:23] Kymix: just a lot more raging
[6:14:24] hirtza1: blind pick is basically the worst of the worst
[6:14:26] Nightshaft25: not really
[6:14:30] nakata545: low elo is about the same as unranked
[6:14:30] kaberite: tbh all lanes are difficult for a new player so might as well just pick the one that doesnt have to engage
[6:14:31] hirtza1: draft normals are a bit more sweaty
[6:14:31] BakerStaunch: !mcucrew

[6:14:41] Kymix: LUL
[6:14:49] zucroh: i would say try 1 game of ARAM see if you enjoy that more as a solo, i know a lot of people who don't like soloq but enjoy solo arams
[6:14:50] ReXoRpG: @itmeJP after lvl 10 and playing draft pick is a lot better
[6:14:58] ArgonFalcon: ranked and normals is two different populations from what I remember both tryharders
[6:15:04] Psomaster: You should see how serious it is, its amazing the amount of rage it contains
