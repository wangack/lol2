[0:02:57] Zizen: cohhJam ijpNODDERS ijpCHEER
[0:03:00] Crosseye_Jack: @Mrshilka The quests are a bit "annoying". Just completed that fishman quest where you ask the angry earth for a seed. The dialog before the quest is all "Oh I'll ask the angry earth but no promises." In the quest menu "items for completeing this quest: The seed" removing all the supense
[0:03:26] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN I was. but brb
[0:03:58] Mrshilka: @Altair900 the pve is great I got a killer build I can kill grounds of higher level enemies solo a dozen or so at times , but it then throws these elite death mobs and like lol you better find another 3+ people to kill it and and the reward is less exp then doing 3 repeatible dailys and the loot is shit

[0:07:57] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN Sorry was poking at things. Yeah my K95 RGB started to fail. Thing is, the keyboard is pretty standard layout, so I basically found a layout editor online, Tweaked a UK board to match the layout of the K95, then routed LEDs, then shipped that off to JLCPCB to make the board. In the end it cost me about the same a new board would of cost (Keyboard manifactures benefit for ordering in bluk). But it was fun to do. :-) There is a pretty decent open source keyboard community out there
[0:07:59] AinzN: Loos at all these awesome people in chat! ijpH ijpLOVE

[0:16:15] Buster_H: @Joebeezer amazed they pulled it off.
[0:16:18] Puretaz: preorder I believe
[0:16:21] SaiZaro: I just requested access to beta on steam and got it
[0:16:25] SlipCrit: so 100$
[0:16:26] KHupp13: Just go to steam and request access
[0:16:32] Joebeezer: @zynessa it’s bittersweet. I get the feeling this the end of smash for a long time…
[0:16:33] KelticNight: Origin is safer
[0:16:36] Foogalicious: it's either or
[0:16:43] Tobin: origin is the ea desktop app right?
[0:16:51] artby_: @itmejp if you have gamepass ultimate you can play it
[0:16:52] Mrshilka: @Tobin yes
[0:16:52] zynessa: @Joebeezer I hear ya, I get that feeling too. But what a fantastic fucking farewell to a fantastic fucking ride!
[0:16:58] KHupp13: Ah okay
[0:16:59] ProxyClouds: I think Game Pass Premium is enough?

[0:17:04] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing ProxyClouds! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:17:04] NinjaPandaEU: EA Desktop has some problems still, so yeah. Origin is safer.
[0:17:06] arctura_alpha: you should be able to pre-load now too
[0:17:14] Joebeezer: @zynessa hell yeah!
[0:17:14] KelticNight: EA Desktop app had issues getting it to appear to install. if you use Origin, it shows in both apps
[0:17:18] Foogalicious: can be ea play or preorder. both work for early access to beta
[0:17:20] FyreAshbane: everytime i tried using EA Desktop it resulted in some sort of bug
[0:17:21] Buster_H: @arctura_alpha yap thats correct.
[0:17:29] Mrshilka: Pog
[0:17:31] Tobin: wait its only open for pre-orders?
[0:17:35] Frog_Quest: Pog
[0:17:38] SchnellBier: rooPog

[0:17:54] SlipCrit: @Tobin no but its 2 days early for deluxe edition
[0:17:56] ThemDemo: ijpH
[0:18:00] NinjaPandaEU: @Tobin Open to everyone on the 8th.
[0:18:04] Darkaros: !ws
[0:18:04] itmeBOT: Check out the Whiskey Sweet twitter at https://twitter.com/WhiskeySweet
[0:18:04] Tobin: aha thanks
[0:18:14] ObeyTheEgg: to play early, yes
[0:18:15] Shrimp_Parm: POGGERS
[0:18:19] GraveSalad: or get EA Play Pro I think
[0:18:22] KelticNight: don't have to buy it if you're an EA Play member, which is a Game Pass perk
[0:18:23] ObeyTheEgg: or had ea play
[0:18:26] zymioi: ijpHI ijpHI
[0:18:32] Foogalicious: or be part of ea play.
[0:18:33] Stealthsuit25: He had closed beta confirmed LUL
[0:18:38] Joebeezer: Gamepass ultimate?
[0:18:40] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN sorry had to step away. What failed on your k95? Just wondering what would be needed to fix it. If I were to do a new board for it, I would prob change what controller I'm currently using (as i'm pushing the limits of the controller, a RP2040 has some programmable IOs which prob could handle the RGB much nicer than the atmel I'm currently using)
[0:18:40] KelticNight: should be a "Try It" button on it's store page
[0:18:40] svensonidis: thanks Darkaros , looks tasty!
[0:18:59] SlipCrit: yes
[0:19:04] GraveSalad: @KelticNight The XGP EA Play is the basic version, you need the Pro version for the early access
[0:19:31] zellers4: i know what you came for catJAM
[0:19:33] aurice_heartly: + TAX lol
[0:19:36] NinjaPandaEU: For me it says all editions give early access to beta.
[0:19:40] Shoaron: I got the welcome to the $100 edition team JP
[0:20:02] FyreAshbane: i think they didn't not hear you are the JPro yet
[0:20:21] AinzN: @Crosseye_Jack it's all good. On the old K95 the main cable started to break and it stopped working so I bought a second one which has 3 keys that don't show red for the LEDs so they are blue instead of my nice purple
[0:20:27] jmj1987: ijpHI
[0:20:37] Foozzie: lol
[0:20:39] ProxyClouds: @itmejp from EA site: Open Beta between October 6-9, 2021. Early access is available on October 6-7, 2021 for all players who pre-order the game or are current EA Play members.
[0:20:49] Miros__: Facebook passing the torch after yesterday's outage

[0:21:10] Tobin: are they doing a facebook?
[0:21:13] KelticNight: @GraveSalad if you have regular Game Pass on PC, you should have early access to the beta. on console I think you need Xbox Ultimate
[0:21:18] SHREDDER007: What trailer are we waiting for right now?
[0:21:25] KelticNight: Ultimate game Pass*
[0:21:29] EndyBT: Wait, so the gamepass ultimate doesn’t get you the early access, correct?
[0:21:35] Tobin: just put your cc info in chat JP so chat can buy it for you NODDERS
[0:21:42] KelticNight: there should be a "Try It" button on it's store page
[0:21:54] arctura_alpha: Go to the store again
[0:21:58] arctura_alpha: yes
[0:22:06] Tobin: KEKW
[0:22:10] BakaOniiChan_: go to steam. go to bf 2042. request access
[0:22:11] Altair900: yeah you still have to buy it for the early access.
[0:22:15] arctura_alpha: you needed to buy it for the 2 day early thing
[0:22:16] KelticNight: yes. otherwise you'd be locked out for 2 days
[0:22:24] AinzN: ijpONO
[0:22:26] ObeyTheEgg: @itmejp do you have ea play? if so, then you don't have to buy it
[0:22:27] Buster_H: If you wanted to start playing tomorrow yap

[0:23:11] NoorElBahrain: I preordered from steam coz origin could not process my payment
[0:23:17] Crosseye_Jack: If all is wrong with the 1st and they are both the same model, why not take a screw driver to them both and go a cable swap. They are just conenctors. Your main issue is gonna be ALL THE SCREWS.. You will have to remove all the caps, the corsair badge (use a heat gun to soften the glue instead of prying it off) and the little over on to the right of the volume wheel. But it will a simple "swap"
[0:23:21] jmj1987: (ditto)
[0:23:31] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN forgot to ping ya
[0:23:38] dumbalex: losing interest in the new world?
[0:23:41] Miros__: How'd your last war go JP?
[0:23:41] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN read the wall of text above
[0:23:47] Tobin: was  / is new world what you expected it to be?
[0:23:51] aurice_heartly: is it more of a Burnout?
[0:24:00] MaxVolume: Oh, you also get access to the Battlefield beta with xbox game pass
[0:24:03] Altair900: KEKW

[0:24:20] Shoaron: the PVP n Crafting are the only things good about it
[0:24:21] aurice_heartly: @itmeJP FF14 spoiled us all
[0:24:25] epicshoo: New World is dog shit with how much PVP I have to do just to mine iron
[0:24:27] Midn1ght: LUL

[0:24:35] 0ldnslow: It depends what you want out of it
[0:24:37] Miros__: I think the 50v50 war is a hell of a lot of fun. Everything else is kinda grindy and shit

[0:24:42] woschdvendetta: from only watching it, never grabbed me tbh
[0:24:46] The_Shift_Key: The gathering is the only good part pretty much
[0:24:48] mecu_: JPs game taste Kappa
[0:24:49] zerohour_88: at least its not a subscription game
[0:24:56] svensonidis: ah, new world. ResidentSleeper
[0:24:59] AinzN: @Crosseye_Jack yeah I guessed that was for me. Yeah they are the exact same model and that. I'll do a bit more research on them as I'm not the best when it comes to this stuff
[0:25:02] Shoaron: $40 is a really good price for that game, I'm looking forward to what else they add
[0:25:04] ItsBatsy: I'm enjoying new world as just a chill crafting game. I have not done any pvp
[0:25:07] DontYouGuysHaveCanvasBags: gotta say the crafting and gathering for trade skills is addictive.
[0:25:07] 0ldnslow: If you have fun gathering and crafting it is a fun grind
[0:25:08] RyanNevill13: the loop sounds really really bad
[0:25:19] aurice_heartly: does New World have a monthly sub?
[0:25:22] Dasutin23: that's how I feel about MOBAs oddly, there's no point to anything

[0:25:33] Darkaros: @aurice_heartly no
[0:25:34] BlargMcBlarg: Just like runescape LUL
[0:25:34] The_Shift_Key: Crafting is annoying because all the kiosks are spread everywhere
[0:25:40] SixPointFive: Crafting is the best gear in the game
[0:25:41] aurice_heartly: @Darkaros i see
[0:25:42] Daikurou: biggest draw is the pvp sieges
[0:25:46] jawatbs: spreadsheet the mmo
[0:25:53] HatHamWitch: doesnt work like that on low pop servers
[0:25:59] Kreggins: it's like a shittier GW2 with open world pvp

[0:26:31] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN its simple enough, take ya time, and (ok I've been taking things apart since I was like 2 years old lol) for me the long part would be putting the keys back in the right place (might as well clean ya keys while your there). But just google a keyboard layout image and you will be good to go.
[0:26:31] TheNewRock: i like it
[0:26:34] Mrshilka: I can make starmetal armour now its worse then dropped stuff

[0:26:36] HatHamWitch: well it doesnt in most mmos
[0:26:38] Nogardknight: and yeah, I was thinking the whole time while looking at the game that GW2 did pretty much everything better

[0:28:59] Nogardknight: Sora btw
[0:29:00] RobbedGamer: I wish Kingdom Hearts 3 was as good as 2
[0:29:01] xarantur: yeah that would been nice

[0:29:01] demigod791: Re:Mind made it better XD

[0:29:09] Darkaros: @icekapp2 in new world? no he stopped at like 35ish after the war
[0:29:09] Altair900: Possibly the biggest if true that could ever happen
[0:29:10] dumbalex: just downloaded chaos trial version 2 stripGo
[0:29:11] konataizumi1982: that cloud streaming for switch is bull crap
[0:29:11] Jtbrig1: Kh3 was good but could have been better.
[0:29:13] Daikurou: take out the wonky mechanics and put ff characters in it. it's good
[0:29:14] TanteTrude: thats a Marvel sized what if
[0:29:20] Sluggs_: play through all the KH games on switch cloud gaming
[0:29:28] Dasutin23: Kingdom Hearts has great music, but the game has always been mediocre to me.
[0:29:28] CrazyAssWizard: If it was good, I'd still like Kingdom Hearts.
[0:29:32] Freddye: Are you playing FarCry6 JP?
[0:29:34] blissfuldan: Imagine if kh3 wasn’t theme park ride simulator KEKW
[0:29:35] cyberronic: yes
[0:29:37] restartdreamertv: it was mainfocus for disney monkaW
[0:29:40] Nogardknight: I feel like KH1 was still really good for the time
[0:29:41] jeffhunter12: thats usually how it goes
[0:29:41] HatHamWitch: it wouldnt have broken you
[0:29:42] aurice_heartly: just wait for KH 4.129340834038
[0:29:45] Shoaron: what ruined KH3 was the Disney attraction attacks
[0:29:48] RyanNevill13: probably not
[0:29:50] Nogardknight: but KH3?  eh
[0:29:51] Darkaros: i dunno if it was possible to not be hyped if you were a KH fan looking forward to KH3
[0:29:56] ProxyClouds: What were your biggest issues with KH3 @itmejp ?
[0:30:02] Daikurou: kh 2 is the best one and will hold up for a long time
[0:30:02] Darkaros: and you wouldn't play KH3 if you weren't a KH fan really LUL continuity etc
[0:30:03] snuffles_80: kh 3  was just a Disney game unlike 1 and 2
[0:30:09] Sonatta: what if KH3 had Star Wars and Marvel in it?
[0:30:10] jeffhunter12: i also liked the story in it
[0:30:10] SlipCrit: its one of my fave games regardless of the haters LUL
[0:30:11] aurice_heartly: @ProxyClouds not enough FF characters
[0:30:17] Kirino20: kh3 was "fine" but we where realy hype for it.. probalby to hype @itmeJP
[0:30:23] aurice_heartly: no FF characters in KH3
[0:30:24] ThemDemo: KH's story makes me worried for where they take FFVII remake part 2
[0:30:25] TanteTrude: not enough FF characters: 0/10
[0:30:25] konataizumi1982: I thought KH 3 was decent enough
[0:30:26] cyberronic: it looked rreally good... I mean the Potc part was damn good
[0:30:28] Baske_T: plus all the theme park rides
[0:30:35] DingoOnMy40: or if it actually came out on the PS3 perspective might have been different
[0:30:37] Dasutin23: I realized that I didn't like KH when they stopped using the FF characters. It was nostalgia baiting me the whole time.
[0:30:39] WabbitHatter: im kinda looking forward to Icarus @itmeJP
[0:30:40] NinoDonDino: i was missing the square characters sooooo much
[0:30:41] Geminihound: I waited 3 for so long, did not care as long as it came out
[0:30:44] MaxVolume: The netire soundtrack is frozen? maybe you should refresh it
[0:30:47] WilliamKurokami: you have to let it go JP
[0:30:56] Shoaron: the themepark rides made it too easy
[0:30:59] demigod791: the game on Critical is actually pretty challengin g
[0:31:10] KingRahe: the thing i disliked the most about kingdom hearts was the rehashing of movie plots but they were still good games
[0:31:15] nati204: You watching the Dunkey video explaining kingdom heart lore was one of the funniest things
[0:31:15] Helix919: because China loves Frozen and Disney caterers to that market
[0:31:25] aurice_heartly: it was a little of Simple with a little of Clean
[0:31:27] Guomi: Hikari is good song NODDERS
[0:31:28] zynessa: @Helix919 ??? everyone loves Frozen
[0:31:37] Dasutin23: Barry's KH videos are my favorite
[0:31:42] Mrshilka: can confirmed everyone loved Frozen
[0:31:52] xarantur: frozen 2 had an actual soul compared to the first one
[0:31:54] snuffles_80: tangled way better
[0:31:54] MaxVolume: I loved the kingdom hearts lore video by barry kramer
[0:31:56] aurice_heartly: 2nd frozen was okay
[0:31:56] Notenoughcoffee: if anything i think china is more a baymax market
[0:31:57] Mrshilka: 2 was ok
[0:32:01] svensonidis: there was a 2nd one?
[0:32:03] jeffhunter12: they also put alot of other movies in the other KH games
[0:32:03] Mrshilka: did not have the magic of the firdt
[0:32:04] poooookey: into the unknown
[0:32:07] Darkaros: Ya that's like saying "China loves Marvel" ijpKEK not wrong but
[0:32:10] NoorElBahrain: good but not as good as the first
[0:32:12] aurice_heartly: Ahhhh... ahhhhhh

[0:32:17] Notenoughcoffee: Baymax is like huge in Asia
[0:32:18] zerohour_88: actually forgot there was Frozen 2 LUL might watch it
[0:32:21] gimpx0r_cpa: best part of frozen 2 was lost in the woods
[0:32:28] dumbalex: 2 felt like a decent tv episode
[0:32:32] Mrshilka: @NoorElBahrain Noor! ijpH
[0:32:35] ProxyClouds: It was good for being a second movie of a Disney franchise but not great
[0:32:36] Mrshilka: First one is Great
[0:32:36] thrillhouse451: 1st one is great Disney
[0:32:41] NoorElBahrain: Mrshilka ijpH
[0:32:42] RauTheLegendary: Super random, but I just played the Into The Pit demo on Steam and it seems really cool. Roguelike old school shooter with Hades influences
[0:32:46] Notenoughcoffee: i prefer the second one
[0:32:47] cyberronic: not a fan of random singing in movies.... so I pass :X

[0:33:05] Helix919: @zynessa there a different It like Everyone loved StarCraft , and South Korea loved StarCraft
[0:33:09] ProxyClouds: The songs were what got me into the movie. Heard 2-3 songs before I even saw the movie
[0:33:13] KHupp13: Does Disney like money

[2:46:37] Darkaros: JP did you auto-skill first thing? I dunno how it is with this char but generally you save first point in case you need an escape in Dota
[2:46:39] Frog_Quest: most likely

[2:47:16] Hydragonn: red hp bar on ward means enemy ward
[2:47:16] Baludor: Normally all the lanes are meant to watch the jungle entrances to stop that happening, but lazy people just sit under tower till the minions spawn
[2:47:22] Joebeezer: w will help a little

[2:52:48] Variandra: @itmeJP use Z to read chat beter and not enter.
[2:52:59] DerfOnTurf: not winning = complete dumbass.  Seems like moba logic
[2:53:07] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:53:11] Infidel_Art: actually perfect opportunity for drag
[2:53:14] Welanh: @DerfOnTurf sad but true
[2:53:16] Moogles1: yep this game super anti-new or casual
[2:53:34] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Ivern is a wierd jungler - he does it way different then others so you can't except normal behaviore
[2:53:37] MostlyHype: such a forced gank
[2:53:59] murasaur: that jungle was way too greedy, it had already failed
[2:54:12] nerscyllathrilla: That might've worked if JP was level 6, but Ivern should've seen that he wasn't
[2:54:17] Nathrael: no
[2:54:17] MostlyHype: no
[2:54:19] ZeroDjinn: no

[2:54:41] Joebeezer: @Khamous_ wife works at riot now
[2:54:44] info209: When you step on a trap or get hit with her net its an automatic heatshot with extra range. thats what that indicator was
[2:54:52] Khamous_: ah, thanks
[2:54:58] JamesOwenThe2nd: jp has played dota as well
[2:55:08] Cut_n_Run: You should anyway yes

[2:55:17] jawatbs: mvp
[2:55:18] Moogles1: huh? lol @Joebeezer
[2:55:19] Jukettaja: lol
[2:55:19] nerscyllathrilla: Recall
[2:55:22] Mondo_Gibbs: MVP Xerath @itmeJP
[2:55:24] Spopovich678: that flash was sick
[2:55:28] RauTheLegendary: These are weirdly high level plays for a low level match
[2:55:34] Joebeezer: xerath was jp's hero
[2:55:44] Jukettaja: Xerath deserves some honours
[2:55:44] nerscyllathrilla: That was a hero play for sure
[2:55:46] Variandra: @itmeJP without boots its 20 secs from base to outer tower. with t2 boots about 14
[2:55:47] Mondo_Gibbs: @RauTheLegendary LoL have a high amount of smurfs
[2:56:07] Infidel_Art: @RauTheLegendary I think it's cause he was playing with Strippin, inflated his MMR a bit
[2:56:09] JimB0b0: I think JP got put into the  smurf queue
[2:56:14] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Brand + Caitlyn is a nasty long, long range poke
[2:56:18] Moogles1: it is a free to play game nothing stopping
[2:56:20] Joebeezer: jp is with smurfs for sure
[2:56:23] DerfOnTurf: just gotta hope the smurfs are on your team
[2:56:27] Baludor: @RauTheLegendary Also, not everyone is new to mobas or gaming. JP is definitely better than the average player on their second day aswell
[2:57:13] Moogles1: mobas arent that hard
[2:57:25] nerscyllathrilla: People are generally better at the game now compared to years ago. There are a lot of resources and people are generally more aware of the mechanics
[2:57:29] UAjech: @itmeJP instead of turning off auto-attack, you can press S to stop moving and attacking
[2:57:33] jmanrme: @itmeJP there's a setting to see xp received numbers. might be helpful to learn how close you need to be to still get xp
[2:57:40] MostlyHype: ModCheck
[2:57:41] SaraScorpion: @Moogles1 fairKEK
[2:57:42] Xani__: mobas is not hard LUL
[2:57:48] nerscyllathrilla: Cait trap
[2:57:51] Joebeezer: traps amplify cait's autos
[2:57:54] Walshmobile: cait gets a damage buff when you get caught in trap
[2:58:02] MostlyHype: headshot
[2:58:05] the_tofu_tom: just use a tango
[2:58:05] ThatDutchSir: if caitlyn hits her trap or net, her next auto against you deals extra damage
[2:58:06] BakaOniiChan_: Cait gets a super auto attack whenever you step in a trap
[2:58:17] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Caitlyn can place traps - when you get stuck in one she does a HUGE amout of extra damage
[2:58:18] Welanh: + she gets snipe range
[2:58:23] fumblyfinger: yeah hes a bad support
[2:58:27] ragrath: Zoning ult

[2:59:02] Spopovich678: he should have left too
[2:59:03] DerfOnTurf: moogles prefessional moba player
[2:59:04] sunsweep: you wouldve died too if you stayed
[2:59:10] YuYuYuna: you were too low to stay, he would have easily killed you
[2:59:13] Proph89: that panth lol
[2:59:14] ragrath: the enemy was visible way ahead, he should backed
[2:59:21] epicshoo: team wants to run it down bot it seems

[2:59:57] Lancetheginger: final fantasy?

[3:00:01] fumblyfinger: if every one agrees it can be 15 now
[3:00:03] zechetto: 15 min now, but I think everyone needs to FF or something
[3:00:11] PrinsesTNGC: ah ok
[3:00:14] Cut_n_Run: 15 for ff and full 5 agree yeah
[3:00:19] MostlyHype: one troll

[3:00:21] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[3:00:24] DerfOnTurf: Well atleast you are using your Brian
[3:00:25] YuYuYuna: nope lol
[3:00:26] ThatDutchSir: are you interested in watching worlds,or just gonna play this for love?
[3:00:27] Walshmobile: 4ppl at 20 min

[3:01:25] nerscyllathrilla: Garen is cheap
[3:01:25] MostlyHype: shes the most expensive
[3:01:25] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP when you do surrender before 20 min it takes all 5
[3:01:26] TheXtractor: yes play riven omg

[3:04:02] Variandra: @itmeJP they did a few years ago and they just removed support for win vista so going forwords they can do alot more with out the vista and 7 support.
[3:04:07] SaraScorpion: Annie or Ahri
[3:04:14] YuYuYuna: annie is great easy to pick up mid
[3:04:23] Cut_n_Run: Annie is solid
[3:04:25] RauTheLegendary: Annie is good to learn because her kit is super straight forward

[3:05:32] KarmaTheQueen: !BF2042
[3:05:33] BakaOniiChan_: thats the most boring thing I can think of. being a onetrick is a sweaty proplayer thing
[3:05:36] Cut_n_Run: Samera (sp) is a good ban imo
[3:05:36] TheRedTyrrant: I just like playing whatever is fun. I just accept that I'll always be bad and lose 80% of my games

[3:11:52] Walshmobile: bard is supp
[3:11:55] DeffsNotErik: pyke mid, bard support
[3:11:55] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP when you open a chest there is a very, VERY small chance - something like 0.0000005% chance
[3:11:59] W_Tile: it means variation skin with boring ass white and gold colors that is more expensive
[3:12:00] adrianlibri: bard is support usually
[3:12:02] Cut_n_Run: Still wish you could sell skins…
[3:12:02] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Bard is a support

[3:13:10] xarantur: Samira doesn't have a cost or cooldown for her Ultimate btw ijpKEK
[3:13:11] QIBuS: yasuo is dumb, a 0/5 can still penta kill
[3:13:19] Nathrael: @itmeJP Yasuo can block your whole utlimate with his W skill - windwall
[3:13:21] iliasna: your mid is playing the newest champion
[3:13:21] DerfOnTurf: Yasuo must be a big name.  The only hero name I have noticed
[3:13:25] Cut_n_Run: Yas 0/9/0 power spike is amazing
[3:13:26] SaraScorpion: he's just infuriating to play against
[3:13:27] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Buuuut he is also a maybemaybemaybe champ
[3:13:30] nerscyllathrilla: Samira does have a cost to her ult. Its gated by her passive
[3:13:33] Welanh: trash yasuo or broken OP yasuo, only 2 types
[3:13:40] Esge: yasuo is broken only when he is on enemy team

[3:18:45] Crazy_Miner51: It's also kinda your supports job to put some kind of pressure on the pyke

[3:18:49] Crazy_Miner51: so he can't do that
[3:19:01] cTrix: Pike is an "All-In" support which means they try and kill you from max hp in a fight he can't back out easily from

[3:24:04] cTrix: in bot games the league tower has a range indicator Kappa
[3:24:07] mett7: everyone knows range Kappa
[3:24:08] Puvis: at this point you should try to have farm, the enemy is a bit a head

[3:38:29] Walshmobile: they double countered you with samira and yasuo also
[3:38:34] geonoxes: @masterventus08 Pretty sure most of us are joking :D
[3:38:41] Gat0rCh0mp: And hit ult lets him go in on a group of people that are knocked up, by him or any other champ's ability that has knockup
[3:38:44] AN71V1RU5: it's the windwall that makes him most annoying for mf

[3:46:03] OdinX1: Only way to dodge is to close the game
[3:46:07] crainesdvda: close client
[3:46:07] Warped_Oblivion: just move the client over out of view?
[3:46:08] Birgerz: and now you close the client
[3:46:09] Moogles1: the X top right

[3:46:23] RagnarozTwo: vunter84 Not really, actually. Have you seen the Michael Jordan documentary? Competitive people are shitheads.
[3:46:24] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP report the players and don't pick a champ let the timer run out and then you have to wait 5 min
[3:46:24] NotYourLad: it's not too bad
[3:46:28] Moogles1: cant queue for 5mins
[3:46:29] TPLivewire: Worth it
[3:46:29] xarantur: you can't queue for 6 min ye

[3:46:44] YuYuYuna: NODDERS
[3:46:48] NotYourLad: unfortunately it looks like you've been put into smurf queue
[3:46:48] Infidel_Art: Wish we could mass report them in chat
[3:46:53] OdinX1: Not likely
[3:46:55] crainesdvda: you'll never play much league then lol
[3:46:55] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: unlikely.
[3:46:56] NotYourLad: nope, it's just... smurf queue players
[3:46:57] caikeh: hardly
[3:46:58] Madracah: @itmeJP lets look at MF Skins cohhEvil
[3:46:58] AN71V1RU5: nah
[3:47:00] MostlyHype: probably not
[3:47:02] Norrak1: Smurf queue is the worst queue
[3:47:02] AinzN: Chat! ijpNO
[3:47:03] Rustles2: No way of knowing, league is just like that sometimes
[3:47:03] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Smurf players
[3:47:05] sombraxyz: kind of hard to make it work
[3:47:09] Garrett_Redden: At your ELO real hard to snipe I bet
[3:47:09] AN71V1RU5: almost impossible, especially at your elo
[3:47:11] Warped_Oblivion: why would he be in smurf q
[3:47:18] MostlyHype: once you get into ranked the pool will open up
[3:47:21] NotYourLad: he probably played well his first few matches
[3:47:24] YuYuYuna: yep
[3:47:26] ObeyTheEgg: yeah
[3:47:28] NotYourLad: it'll give you a timer
[3:47:30] hans1234364534: @Fractal_Oblivion if you win a lot early, you get put in smurf q
[3:47:33] Noobpownin09: league iq in gen
[3:47:34] Warped_Oblivion: hes 4-8 ?
[3:47:36] crainesdvda: yes

[3:47:38] Shadow77113: Probably just do champ select off screen on another monitor to avoid that showing up on stream
[3:47:39] ok_juju: I see the solo ques in LoL are similar to Dota ijpSUFFER
[3:47:51] Shoaron: you won a lot with Sam
[3:47:53] RauTheLegendary: It's probably because you played with Strippin
[3:47:59] 14neo: didn't we win a lot earlier?
[3:47:59] Infidel_Art: It may be cause you played with Sam
[3:48:02] Moogles1: i had a match of racist kids on halo infinite flight last weekend looking for twitch streamers to say  offensive terms on @itmeJP
[3:48:07] ProxyClouds: You won a lot with Sam

[3:48:17] NotYourLad: and got put into smurf queue
[3:48:21] caikeh: 27/2 damn
[3:48:25] nakata545: It also bases performance and he plays well because of dota experience
[3:48:26] Warped_Oblivion: 3 normal blind pick games does not put you in smurf LUL
[3:48:33] mett7: pretty balance i say Kappa
[3:48:34] VioletEden: also very high CS for a new account which you had will land you in smurf q
[3:48:36] geoffsgayestfan: that's why I never got into league, tried playing with a friend like 5 years ago and every game was against a stack of smurfs
[3:48:38] Deathspate: Tutorials don't count you kappa

[4:09:25] Mondo_Gibbs: trading while there is an enemy Soraka is super rough
[4:09:27] mett7: they lost bot
[4:09:28] Baludor: It was really bad to B, you lost the entire wave
[4:09:29] MageDaemon: When he got those orbiting balls around him and he kills a minion, you both get the gold
[4:09:33] RauTheLegendary: Starting E is pretty normal on Thresh tho
[4:09:36] MostlyHype: @Fractal_Oblivion e start was ok but he played way too aggro
[4:09:37] Infidel_Art: You should wait to engage them until Thresh hits a hook. Otherwise just stay back and get as much farm as you can

[4:09:41] ClearlyFrog: E is standard start
[4:09:49] Jukettaja: I don't mind Soraka in the lane but she just forces you to focus her so hard in team fights that all the hyper carries can freely do whatever and snowball
[4:09:49] LagoutLoud: E start totally normal on thresh
[4:10:14] adrianlibri: he has a support item
[4:10:14] Altair900: Hes not its giving both you and him money
[4:10:16] ClearlyFrog: he shares with you
[4:10:17] FleetingSpark: he's not stealing it
[4:10:17] Tenagra: he's giving you the gold
[4:10:21] MostlyHype: hes helping
[4:10:22] Hexionas: he kills it and it gives u both gold
[4:10:25] Twizzlar: he's not taking, if he has a little blue sphere going around it gives him and you both the cs
[4:10:28] Jibbur: that sound is him sharing it with you, you still get full gold
[4:10:34] LagoutLoud: @itmeJP Read his support item
[4:10:34] aetralos: @itmeJP he gives it to u also
[4:10:37] Hexionas: but only when he has those blue orbs around him
[4:10:37] Warped_Oblivion: E into that lane does not seem fine at all
[4:10:49] Duncain: there will be up to 3 blue orbs around him, each one allows him to last hit a minion and you both get credit/gold
[4:10:53] kosarkislev: if you see the gold amount, you get the gold as well
[4:10:54] NotYourLad: the one circle from soraka silences
[4:10:59] NotYourLad: the other heals her if it hits you
[4:11:00] MostlyHype: yeah its not great but i get it
[4:11:02] Warped_Oblivion: unless he gonna flash E lvl1
[4:11:13] Infidel_Art: Wow Thresh had to take that kill tho
[4:11:16] TheXtractor: nicu
[4:11:26] MostlyHype: even f e isnt a kill at 1 for this lane tho
[4:11:29] masterventus08: Thresh did it pog
[4:11:33] Infidel_Art: Good guy
[4:11:41] Warped_Oblivion: true
[4:11:47] NotYourLad: MF-thresh is a nice lane combo, MF E gives thresh extra time to go in and flay or hook
[4:12:06] Razayken: Anyone remember the days of AD thresh LUL
[4:12:06] RauTheLegendary: This MF skin is pretty cool
[4:12:06] 4braxis: wow Mundo effed renekton up while he was getting ganked, lol
[4:12:26] Moogles1: it is mundo... @theAbraxis
[4:12:37] TheXtractor: @RauTheLegendary fits thresh good theme
[4:12:39] MostlyHype: the ult effect is fun
[4:12:53] Madracah: @itmeJP Consider getting the Healing Reduction item asap.

[4:15:50] AinzN: ijpNOM
[4:15:52] NotYourLad: recommend buying a vision ward on your next back so that you can clear wards out
[4:16:04] NotYourLad: 75 gold, is worth if you have the extra gold
[4:16:07] amo1337: MF so fun
[4:16:12] jmj1987: ijpBOOP
[4:16:13] tglenn: when your minion wave hits the tower is usually a good time to go buy

[4:17:49] AinzN: So do items have actives like in Dota or are they all just like passive?
[4:18:01] NotYourLad: there are items with actives, yes @AinzN

[4:19:00] adrianlibri: i like the recall animation
[4:19:25] MostlyHype: has thresh lanterned yet?
[4:19:26] NotYourLad: if thresh can get a good cage off you can prob kill them in a 2v2
[4:19:29] Rustles2: @AinzN Some do, most don't
[4:19:57] NotYourLad: jinx rockets hurt more than her machine gun
[4:20:00] AinzN: All I know of LoL is what I've seen JP play and that they make amazing music videos
[4:20:09] NotYourLad: no, he missed hook
[4:20:12] MostlyHype: no he just missed

[4:59:27] MageDaemon: lebonas you're describing twitch chat
[4:59:29] Twizzlar: the cat is super annoying and op on bruisers
[4:59:30] ritchie313: that was such a bad seriers of moves
[4:59:44] veif__: @itmejp unfortunate lux hit her ulti on you, thats all
[4:59:50] Deathspate: The cat is strong on hypercarries and bruisers in general
[5:00:19] zenoots: pretty good last hitting. props
[5:00:32] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[5:00:33] Twizzlar: yup
[5:00:34] zenoots: oh ya lux is disgusting
[5:00:35] Lurkiestmonstr0: Mage support
[5:00:40] br4nd0nh347: she's also mid
[5:00:47] Ardailec: Lux is normally mid
[5:00:47] jjonnej: lux is not actually a support but a mage
[5:00:53] sombraxyz: well lux is not originally a support
[5:00:53] Baludor: Supports usually have good base stats, so they can be a threat whilst the ADC scales late
[5:00:56] Deathspate: Mage supports really
[5:01:03] KnightofZero2182: I remember when the support was the mid laner lol
[5:01:04] TasPlays: Might wanna ult the wave if they push you in too hard
[5:01:16] Darkaros: PepeLaugh sounds like the equivalent of Lina support who just nukes people
[5:01:18] Fuji_5: It's a misconception that supports are "soft" Yes, they do quite a bit of damage depending on their build
[5:01:18] TheXtractor: they made support super broken over the years
[5:01:21] zenoots: I play brand support. Always the most damage in the game
[5:01:27] TheXtractor: pretty much best role in the game atm
[5:01:27] Aegis_and_Pred: Hello! I'm sorry to bug you but are you part of One Of Us Gaming on Discord? If not, I believe that someone is impersonating you with their Discord alias and I wasn't sure how to let you know 🙈
[5:01:28] Madracah: RUN
[5:01:28] MostlyHype: kindred marked you
[5:01:36] ZeroDjinn: Samira doing Samira things
[5:01:37] Twizzlar: yea samira going to be a nightmare
[5:01:39] br4nd0nh347: Samira doing Samira things
[5:01:56] Fuji_5: you're doing good. Keep shootin
[5:01:58] Kleph78: no! My 10k channel points. will go up in smoke unless there is a miracle LUL
[5:02:07] 4braxis: yeah just keep blastin
[5:02:07] DezartIII: I have a friend who liked to play Le Blanc support, when Le Blanc was op
[5:02:32] zenoots: yep perfect back time
[5:03:02] TheXtractor: wow didnt realize that when an ad pops up you can still see the stream in the top corner. is that new ><
[5:03:04] afreak10: KEKW
[5:03:05] MostlyHype: YEP
[5:03:12] personafreaks: AAAADDDDSSSSS
[5:03:19] Devlind: ijpHI ijpHI chat and JP. hope you have a superb day so far.
[5:03:23] Twizzlar: yuumi is super good on the other 3 champs on your team though
[5:03:24] ElSpartin: yea
[5:03:28] Altair900: ads cometh? hypeE
[5:03:29] Baludor: You get extra exp if you're solo laning, so it's not too bad
[5:03:35] Aegis_and_Pred: @TheXtractor Same, that's actually super cool
[5:03:38] DezartIII: o/ Devlind
[5:03:41] Twizzlar: nice

[5:03:47] titanodin: that circle stops her from dying
[5:03:47] afreak10: Clap
[5:03:47] freaker286: Clap
[5:03:47] Infidel_Art: Nice 1v1
[5:03:50] Deathspate: This is why a lot of ADCs hate Yuumi, because she tends to abandon you
[5:03:59] zymioi: @bairdman ijpHI
[5:04:00] jingosaurus: circle stops anyone in it from dying
