[0:27:00] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN There you go.
[0:27:05] Miros__: It would be an interesting game if they removed everything except the wars. The 50 v 50 battle is amazing fun... but it's very limited in terms of frequency and access.

[0:27:32] Korzeniuszka: You either hide the spreadsheet, or embrace the spreadsheets like eve online
[0:27:35] MaxVolume: I also play Runescape, so that's fine
[0:27:35] Unyates: holy shit its 1pm lol
[0:27:35] TheodenArratay: @itmeJP yeah i spent 100 hours in the game and i enjoyed all 100 hours, because i was racing the fast players, but then i had to go do responsabilities and fell behind, now i have no reason to login because its not a great game
[0:27:42] its__fil: If New World is a spreadsheet, is EVE Online Microsoft Excel? rooThink

[1:37:58] Reijm11: his is under BF for me
[1:38:00] 14neo: i agree that the Battlefield 2042 beta has issues, and it has also made some people probably cancel their pre-orders or be wary of launch - that being said, there's those who still had fun, and look forward to things being fixed later on monkaHmm
[1:38:05] aurice_heartly: @Darkaros KEKW
[1:38:11] KelticNight: @Daruvik it just doesn't feel like Battlefield. classes are gone, zero teamwork, flying controls have been changed, hit detection is dire.. and knowing DICE it'll take around 10 months to fix it Sadge

[1:38:56] Daruvik: @KelticNight Feels like a battlefield game to me, but I never touch vehicles, and hit detection is working great, I die all the time!
[1:39:16] NinjaPandaEU: I tried the beta today and never really got over 60 FPS with an 8700 & a 3060 TI. It was kind of stable, but not good.
[1:39:18] 14neo: @Biby07 limited by range and wonky
[1:39:23] WageSqueeze: I bought 2042 thinking it was 2142 remake. asked for refund. don't care lol

[1:56:52] Reckless_Rob: @Wonton_Sushi Ohh ok, I kinda like that though
[1:57:00] Revzt: should have shorter range than the LMG

[2:05:19] TylerSouth88: can anyone tell if me the guns have damage fall-off at longer ranges, or are they just less accurate?
[2:05:19] ArcaneSyntax: I mean, it's a beta.
[2:05:22] Daitorex: we can only hope
[2:05:32] Altair900: you can still goof around. you just wont have a great Win loss, but who cares about that. Theres probably a lot more sweating in the beta rn than there will be at launch
[2:05:33] ZoneAleks: Wishful thinking
[2:05:35] XeiZ: i really hope the whole weapon loadout / attachement thing is just a beta thing but the way the attachement menu looks makes me scared
[2:05:36] MrMacaroli: They been real vocal defending it in that way, that a lot of the QoL is in the later builds and this one is "months old"

[2:09:49] MNmichael: is there no first person tank view?
[2:09:52] MNmichael: nm

[2:10:22] Reckless_Rob: Is tank 1 person only now?
[2:10:22] ArcaneSyntax: tanks, like dogs, can't look up

[2:10:54] KelticNight: yes
[2:10:54] ZoneAleks: yup
[2:10:55] glasandy: My thing with tanks is I feel a single soldier should not be able to kill a tank.
[2:10:58] Hyper_Remy: as a tank pulls up on @itmeJP
[2:11:10] ZoneAleks: don't take the small clip
[2:11:10] MrPeabodyLive: @Reckless_Rob no ther is a turret i belive on the top

[2:11:14] LucetteVeen: looks like a VR interface
[2:11:21] ThePointGaming: yeah right now...really hoping for a loadout option, which im assuming will be in release
[2:11:34] Reckless_Rob: @MrPeabodyLive Oh ok. I saw 4 seats I think in the UI, but nobody joined LUL
[2:11:38] MrPeabodyLive: @ThePointGaming Loadout option?
[2:11:45] Revzt: The bigger problem is the chad airplanes.. if they are to strong tanks don't matter anyway-
[2:11:45] Lutcha81: attachments are also weird, some give only minus to stats, while some give only plus
[2:11:45] RallosZek: changing vehicle gear isnt available right now since its just a demo pretty sure

[2:13:17] WageSqueeze: @itmeJP how do you feel when it takes 4-6 bullets to kill and everyone is so fast?

[2:14:46] eryuuvim: did dice not buy rights to weapon names?
[2:14:54] Mrshilka: @eryuuvim seems so
[2:15:03] MrPeabodyLive: @Zaqster as i said this biuld dose not same the loadout ona al ot of the guns right now
[2:15:09] Reckless_Rob: Nice!
[2:15:10] Daruvik: @eryuuvim this occurs in the future, these weapons don't exist yet
[2:15:19] KelticNight: the ol' Alibaba Vector
[2:15:20] Shoaron: this gun is nuts on infantry
[2:15:21] MrPeabodyLive: @Zaqster this is an old biuld
[2:15:21] Mrshilka: its 21 yearsinthe future
[2:15:24] afreak10: double kill
[2:15:29] Mrshilka: we will be using 95% the same weapons
[2:15:33] Altair900: @Mrshilka really happy with the magnums reload anim, nice little detail of dropping the unspent bullets out and then popping the spent cartridges out
[2:15:39] SpawnOnMe: It’s a he best one in the beta IMO
[2:15:43] Moogles1: it is cheaper to make own weapon names
[2:15:56] furry_wolf2001b: @Mrshilka aye, i was being sarcastic
[2:15:56] Jay_rb: YEP
[2:15:59] eryuuvim: seems very near future @Daruvik
[2:16:07] Mrshilka: @Altair900 Alt! oh nice not seen that yet! ijpH
[2:16:30] zynessa: unless they invent a new type of gunpowder, the guns are just slightly modified version of existing guns KEKW
[2:16:35] Moogles1: @eryuuvim they dont have to no real point
[2:16:43] Altair900: @Mrshilka Heya! hope things are well. yeah, server issues aside, loved what I played yesterday
[2:16:44] Reckless_Rob: LUL
[2:16:45] Mrshilka: @furry_wolf2001b all good I helped write white paper for procurment of new arms for the Australian army so I seen people look at 30 year old weapon system and say we can push it another 15 lol
[2:16:47] Lutcha81: is there a way to see when the enemy can see your outline ?
[2:16:50] EndyBT: I personally would’ve liked a bit more future stuff. But it’s whatever
[2:16:51] Daruvik: @eryuuvim it's possible to invent new guns in 21 years
[2:16:55] Digirat: bad UI is a battlefield staple
[2:16:57] Lutcha81: cus i have no idea if i am spotted or not
[2:17:13] Mrshilka: nah bf3 and 4 ui was fine
[2:17:14] Reckless_Rob: Its big and simple
[2:17:15] irontoast29: minimal/
[2:17:16] SpawnOnMe: agreed, its super messy
[2:17:16] irontoast29: ?
[2:17:17] MrPeabodyLive: @Lutcha81 no not in this biuld
[2:17:18] SlipCrit: id say less simpel than 1 and V
[2:17:19] zynessa: @eryuuvim But there's no reason to, that's the thing.
[2:17:20] JetLi47: the UI is way too big & in your face
[2:17:20] Tenivir: console ui on pc usually feels bad
[2:17:21] Mey_Raki: Yea the UI should just go back to bf3-4 style
[2:17:22] KelticNight: UI is dogshit, nearly universally disliked LUL
[2:17:30] superbeefman: I don't want to have to press 4 buttons to tell the game I want to respawn
[2:17:34] Reckless_Rob: No one saw! KEKLEO
[2:17:45] furry_wolf2001b: @Mrshilka totally true, guns do not age that way, would be cool if the soldiers actually had more bullet risistant gear tho, but cost...
[2:17:47] eryuuvim: im aware just wondering if anyone at dice did actually make that decision knowingly @Daruvik
[2:18:06] Andruisthegamer: Pog
[2:18:07] WageSqueeze: let's be honest, after bf 2142 or bad company 2, dice never did a great game again
[2:18:11] Eristaios: is jp playing solo today?
[2:18:14] Moogles1: releasing beta with old build idk if was a good idea
[2:18:28] Darkaros: ya for now Eristaios
[2:18:41] SpawnOnMe: @moogles1 agreed. I think it turned off a lot of potential players
[2:18:43] Mey_Raki: @moogles1 yup…a lot of ppl gonna cancel preorders I believe
[2:18:48] peaks102: @Moogles1 most betas are older builds
[2:18:49] Reckless_Rob: @Moogles1 I mean you got no choice, but depends on how old/bad the build is
[2:18:52] Mrshilka: @furry_wolf2001b well they do have plates int his as a gadget, when I joined the arm yin 97 the Australian army did not use body armour that did not come about til Afghanistan in late 2001
[2:18:54] MrPeabodyLive: @Moogles1 well it will make you apresiate the bug fixes when the game dose come out
[2:18:55] WageSqueeze: @Mey_Raki i did
[2:18:58] mechboos: hit reg is like dog water
[2:19:09] Zaqster: you absolutely did Clap
[2:19:09] Reckless_Rob: Yeah that was a rad drop
[2:19:09] 14neo: i agree that Battlefield 4 UI is fine NODDERS - this could use some improvement in some areas, but i assume that it is pretty evident it will be changed by launch (don't know if for better or worse though) monkaHmm
[2:19:11] Lutcha81: you were the push
[2:19:24] Eristaios: oh okay
[2:19:35] furry_wolf2001b: @Mrshilka yeah, but it is sad that so little is given to those whose risks their lives
[2:19:38] Twilight_Spark: A seekrit tunnel!
[2:19:42] eryuuvim: can you still check the tab stats?
[2:19:44] Mey_Raki: @wagesqueeze same and imma HUGGGEEE BF fan….based off this it needs 2-4 months more work
[2:19:51] Danni__Boi: Chat, Is there only this specific game mode in the beta?
[2:19:56] Mrshilka: Mrshilka gifted a Tier 1 sub to 14neo! They have given 283 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:19:56] itmeBOT: Welcome to itmeNATION 14neo ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE - Thanks to Mrshilka for gifting the sub :-D
[2:20:02] Cheese_Grater_21: Ive played the beta for like 6+ hours and haven’t gotten this version of the map. Does anyone know why?
[2:20:12] Cheese_Grater_21: I only get the smaller version
[2:20:12] zynessa: @Mrshilka Honestly, the big issue is that there's no simple solution. They can make really protective plates and stuff, but the soldiers end up ditching it in the field because it's too bulky and weighs too much.
[2:20:15] KelticNight: @Danni__Boi yes. 1 game mode on 1 map
[2:20:16] MrPeabodyLive: @Mey_Raki this biuld as the devs said is like 4 or 5 biulds behind so....
[2:20:19] peaks102: @Danni__Boi there are many...it's just the biggest played mode
[2:20:22] Bubbafeta: Up playing with controller or this all mouse and keyboard ??
[2:20:22] Moogles1: this is 3 months old build @Mey_Raki
[2:20:27] SlipCrit: @Cheese_Grater_21 what do you meanthis version ? the weather? its random
[2:20:39] Mrshilka: @furry_wolf2001b thats the civilian part kicking in dollars and numbers same reason VA is so bad, once it it out of armies hands thing go south
[2:20:40] Darkaros: JP's doing M+K
[2:20:41] 14neo: @Mrshilka thank you very much! ijpH ijpBOOP
[2:20:47] Reckless_Rob: Whats the dog do?
[2:20:51] Danni__Boi: Shame, im really excited to see the custom game modes
[2:20:57] Lutcha81: shoots.. alot
[2:20:58] Reckless_Rob: Attack dog
[2:20:59] Cheese_Grater_21: The gamemodes i play only have ABC as objectives not A-F
[2:21:01] Darkaros: also Mrshilka ijpLURK ijpHI
[2:21:02] Mey_Raki: @moogles1 hopefully they been workin a lot on it cuz this ain’t it…
[2:21:04] Reckless_Rob: It shoots?
[2:21:05] dylanby: What da dog doin?
[2:21:05] Hexof: what the dog do
[2:21:06] Zaqster: the dog is awesome
[2:21:10] furry_wolf2001b: @Mrshilka so true
[2:21:14] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1446874316226826240
[2:21:16] JetLi47: @Darkaros whats wrong with my message ? too long ???
[2:21:19] KelticNight: What's updog do?
[2:21:20] Mrshilka: @zynessa poorly led troops are allowed to ditch armour, no unit I led every left base light
[2:21:23] Lutcha81: its a gundog
[2:21:23] eryuuvim: dog is just suppressing fire machine
[2:21:24] UGoBooMBooM: The "this is an old build" people are gonna be real sad when they learn they're lesson for the 1000th time, that the game is gonna be exactly the same as they're playing now.
[2:21:30] Goa_gubben: this map seems really big
[2:21:40] WageSqueeze: 2 grenades dont kill huh
[2:21:41] Mrshilka: @14neo good to see you my friend, no no sub for you NOPERS ijpH
[2:21:44] diabolikalll: diabol63Ughhh diabol63Ughhh
[2:21:49] KosmicKing78: This k-30 and lmg are my favs atm, dmr and sniper seem a little weak imo
[2:21:54] Hexof: 2042 really seems like a leap in the wrong direction for BF PepeHands
[2:21:56] mechboos: @UGoBooMBooM thank you dude! thought i was crazy LUL
[2:22:01] Mrshilka: @Darkaros Dark!, I am sorry I missed you clip show!, I hope your well ijpH
[2:22:05] Darkaros: I don't have automod messages on but I assume you posted the forbidden punctuation (ellipses) :p
[2:22:11] Mrshilka: its way modern battlefield is going
[2:22:16] MrPeabodyLive: @UGoBooMBooM ya but with more bug fixes and more contents and more maps and more unlocks so no it is not the same gajme
[2:22:22] Digirat: this weather is cool
[2:22:23] Mrshilka: man portible at weapons so strong now tanks MUST be supported by inf
[2:22:25] zynessa: @Mrshilka Yeah, because in practice the military understands that you can't issue too cumbersome equipment. The problem with making better stuff than they have now isn't a cost issue, it's a bulk and weight issue.
[2:22:30] Goa_gubben: how many players are on this map?
[2:22:30] Darkaros: MmmHmm I'm good Mrshilka just chillin stripCozy
[2:22:33] Kousa: @Hexof people been saying that last 10years already so LUL
[2:22:33] furry_wolf2001b: if EVERYONE can kill em, yep
[2:22:36] Reckless_Rob: Oh I missed the clip show? :(
[2:22:38] WageSqueeze: in bad company 2 tanks were op, so 1 tank was enough
[2:22:45] 14neo: i hope AA weapons are made a tad bit more effective for taking down aircraft though ijpHMM
[2:22:49] Lutcha81: tanks can also be 1 shot by the recoilless m5 from behind
[2:22:50] JetLi47: its funny to me that they said the build is months old but the critique that was given wasnt fixed when the beta released. should be way more polished since its only 1 map
[2:22:53] KelticNight: LUL
[2:22:53] orbitstarr: i think this is a medium sized map too, at 128 players
[2:22:55] Mrshilka: @14neo yeah
[2:22:57] 14neo: some latency issues make it harder to aim and take them down
[2:23:00] bulletsponge55: remember in bad company the shotgun slugs were better than sniper rounds lol
[2:23:06] freetownJoe: Pog
[2:23:21] 14neo: @Mrshilka also, appreciate it - good to see you too ijpDOGSLIDE
[2:23:33] Digirat: they still make you end your revivability if you want to see the spawn screen?
[2:23:35] Mrshilka: @zynessa your 100% right its a cost issue and thats out of the militarys hands
[2:23:36] KelticNight: JP spitting hot death NODDERS
[2:23:40] twitchingDoe: omg dogs got guns OhMyDog
[2:23:44] MrPeabodyLive: @14neo other way aropund they are grat ant taking helicopters fdown but tarible at defending agienst infantry if you do not have someone in the second gun
[2:23:49] Reckless_Rob: I didnt know JP Is a pro FPS gamer
[2:23:49] tphuman: This is super fun to watch dude
[2:23:54] zade80: Nice to se gameplay with nice flow. And fun gunplay
[2:24:00] peaks102: @JetLi47 They are not going to put in extra effort and time to polish a beta....they are a AAA game developer so they know people will buy regardless
[2:24:04] Shoaron: no one ever revives
[2:24:09] ashla11: this gun reminds me of smgs in BF4
[2:24:09] twitchingDoe: burkeWaddle burkeWaddle burkeWaddle
[2:24:15] JetLi47: the devs comments about " dont worry, the game will be fixed at launch & we are making daily progress " in the time & age where cyberpunk released this bad is funny as well atpCap
[2:24:16] Reckless_Rob: Now its poop?
[2:24:18] Reckless_Rob: Smell?
[2:24:22] gooseboy429: its only 1 map also
[2:24:33] Gank4CE1: you lose a ticket for respawn
[2:24:41] Reckless_Rob: Ringing endorsement
[2:24:44] Altair900: Exactly! Other than the server issues, the game is great!
[2:24:44] mechboos: @JetLi47 on top of that there is a mouse issue which boggles my mind
[2:24:44] zynessa: I feel like the game itself is fine, but the map isn't great.
[2:24:50] Hexof: its missing alot of features from previous BF's
[2:24:51] JetLi47: @peaks102 i would argue bf v did rly bad in comparison to older titles
[2:24:51] WageSqueeze: feels like we are playing free for all, this game have no idea of frontline, enemies can respawn near or above you all the time
[2:24:51] ThePointGaming: more maps, other game modes will decide my purchase
[2:24:53] Mrshilka: Cyberpunk was grea ton pc
[2:24:57] KelticNight: really wish they'd make nemies a different colour though
[2:25:01] KelticNight: enemies*
[2:25:06] 14neo: as long as they fix certain issues, which they hopefully will, i agree it is fine ijpNODDERS
[2:25:07] MrPeabodyLive: cross play dose make it hard when consoles get a little aim assist
[2:25:09] superbeefman: I really dislike how you have to "opt-into" respawning - like the default should not be to wait for 30 seconds to go to the spawn screen
[2:25:10] Mrshilka: if they had giving old consoles the finger it would been glorious
[2:25:11] omsine_wav: the map is epic imo
[2:25:16] demon_raker87: Graphics makes me so wet
[2:25:17] SadzeihTV: it has glaring issues IMO. Both teams are the same color, same characters, which can make it hard to know who's a friend and who's an ennemy
[2:25:19] SpawnOnMe: I took me a day or two to get to that same place as well @itmejp
[2:25:19] grantelbot: if you only have 1 map it gets overplayed
[2:25:22] extrabacon: they better have a Wake Island map or its not battlefield
[2:25:27] Shoaron: everyone fights around point E and D while snipers crawl around in the jungle LUL
[2:25:29] omsine_wav: the other night the tornado hit and went right thru the rocket and the rocket took off through it, one of the most epic things ive ever fucking witnessed
[2:25:34] BossManEazzy: wish they would have dropped like 1 more map for the beta
[2:25:39] Reckless_Rob: Oh I thought they were gas grenades
[2:25:42] KelticNight: 128 Mackay's and Boris's wearing the same outfit, good luck KEKW
[2:25:43] omsine_wav: even tho logically that rocket should have been fked lol
[2:25:43] peaks102: @JetLi47 compared to other games they get enough sales....they never sell like Cod
[2:25:44] JetLi47: @SadzeihTV free 4 all solves the problem atpRtsd
[2:26:01] Mrshilka: wll wake be above water in 2042 Hmm
[2:26:07] Reckless_Rob: 5 was alright
[2:26:07] BossManEazzy: does beta end tommrow ?
[2:26:09] Mey_Raki: battlefield 4....2
[2:26:11] Th3rd3: no tornado in beta?
[2:26:12] Mrshilka: def bf 4 with some cod
[2:26:18] GOLDMVRK: that's good to hear
[2:26:18] Mrshilka: nado is random
[2:26:23] Mey_Raki: @Th3rd3 it is just barely happens
[2:26:24] titanodin: this looks better than 4
[2:26:25] ThePezinator30125: is there any grind aspects to it?
[2:26:25] SadzeihTV: I miss the classes
[2:26:25] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @Th3rd3  yes
[2:26:30] KelticNight: come back classes Sadge
[2:26:31] Th3rd3: I see
[2:26:31] Mrshilka: the movement and sliding is right out of warzone
[2:26:33] mechboos: the sliding is absolutley cod
[2:26:34] IronBicepss: dont disrespect bf1 like that
[2:26:36] GOLDMVRK: I hope they do something about everyone looking the same
[2:26:42] Shoaron: I want to be able to set up my load out out of game
[2:26:45] Wonton_Sushi: @Th3rd3 Tornado is a random spawn right now.
[2:26:53] Schfiftyfive55: id like to see them remake 2142
[2:26:54] BossManEazzy: battle field 4 with new graphics and movements
[2:26:55] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @Th3rd3  is random. It might happen on this map because it is raining
[2:27:00] KelticNight: DING DING DING dinner is ready!
[2:27:01] Reckless_Rob: LUL
[2:27:02] Hexof: not a fan of the specialist system, prefer the old class system random soldier skins personally
[2:27:02] peaks102: People like to hide in those all the time
[2:27:03] Mey_Raki: they should def go back to the class system and just categorize the specialist.
[2:27:09] Reckless_Rob: Nah it wasnt bad
[2:27:10] furry_wolf2001b: if my reacktion times where better i would have liked to play it, i am soo slow nowadays
[2:27:18] Balterh: but you could hear them mate
[2:27:19] mechboos: bf1 was actually very enjoyable, much more than V
[2:27:21] jehl3: when does this game actually drop?
[2:27:29] Mrshilka: I am also old and slow and shakey so no bf for me
[2:27:30] WageSqueeze: bf1 was bad as bf5
[2:27:32] FayFoFum: I thought Battlefield One was okay, 5 was great until they made bad changes and I hope this one is good
[2:27:34] Katshing: bf1 was awsome, bf 5 sucked
[2:27:41] zepillon: Battlefield 1 was good dipshit.
[2:27:44] KelticNight: there's zero teamwork in this, every just mackay's around the map like a CoD player
[2:27:44] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:27:46] SpawnOnMe: Bf1 & 5 we’re bad
[2:27:47] Shoaron: LUL
[2:27:49] WageSqueeze: bf5 didn't even had hardcore mode!!!
[2:27:49] Kousa: people love 5 now KEKW
[2:27:49] Baludor: I think the only BF universally disliked is Hardline. I really enjoyed the rest
[2:27:50] JetLi47: bf1 wasnt that bad & especially way better than the shitshow bf 5 was
[2:27:50] peaks102: @Hexof There might be specialist skins....we won't know until release....but I agree with ya
[2:27:53] Reckless_Rob: They werent the best, but they were all right
[2:27:55] SquidwardTentacles: A lot of people are claiming this is Just BF 4.5 which isn't a bad thing. BF1 and BF5 was meh.
[2:27:56] Baludor: 5 is the best D:
[2:27:58] Shoaron: Pog
[2:27:58] Mey_Raki: clip it
[2:27:58] Jarakie7: i played one over 4 bc the tanks and helos were just too annoying. like 6 rockets just to disable? and all 3 gunners could hop out and stick a torch on it and its like you never hurt it
[2:27:59] FoXsTeRDOTA: HOLY Pog
[2:28:00] Luthien_Cross: Pog
[2:28:01] rollingstop: Pog

[2:28:30] lilbrown10: easy Clap
[2:28:30] Truder2k: the moment to moment gameplay in BFV is arguably the best in the series... it just fucking sucked at everything else, and was a buggy mess

[2:29:35] Mrshilka: How is Erin feeling?
[2:29:36] freetownJoe: Hmm
[2:29:41] Gotfrag_is_life: Yeah @itmeJP looked like you had a blast playing it. Halo infinite.
[2:29:42] furry_wolf2001b: man russ dominates
[2:29:42] Mrshilka: was it a sinus inffection?
[2:29:43] Crosseye_Jack: Erin hands JP a breadstick and keeps the rest
[2:29:44] 4braxis: the ambient noise is spooky
[2:29:47] Balterh: best part of bf is playing as a unit
[2:29:50] Reckless_Rob: https://clips.twitch.tv/BelovedEndearingOwlTooSpicy-zaWfmTnwRL2JwDCi
[2:29:54] JetLi47: i only care for halo infinite's campaign
[2:29:55] pr_necroskull: hardline was the worst tbh of all the battlefields
[2:29:55] 14neo: @14neo your points are valid - what i was referring to is how certain strims that people shoot anti-air weaponry, while the helicopter doesn't have a flare available, it still somehow avoids being destroyed due to latency or lag skips - if that is fixed, then i am okay with the balance staying the same i think ijp7
[2:29:55] Helevetti: would have been ace if you would have stolen the little bird after you nailed the pilot
[2:30:02] Mrshilka: get well soon Erin!
[2:30:05] Edot_KH: were you still going to do a replay of the Halo 1-5 story?
[2:30:15] Mey_Raki: cant u just change the type of mag for more ammo???

[2:31:30] zepillon: If you think Battlefield 1 is bad then your mentally challenged.
[2:31:31] Reckless_Rob: Thats a big boy
[2:31:32] isupergirl: Erin working on her Solid Snake impression
[2:31:35] Mrshilka: if Erin was not wearing a shawl that voice is wasted
[2:31:37] BossManEazzy: butter it up
[2:31:39] ArcaneSyntax: D R Y pretzel is better than a M O I S T pretzel?
[2:31:39] Shoaron: is someone choking Eren while she talks wtf
[2:31:40] Nemm__: Wait, you americans need sauce to your pretzel? Weaklings!
[2:31:45] SlipCrit: needs beer cheese
[2:31:47] Reckless_Rob: I dont think ive ever had a pretzel like that. I think theyre different here
[2:31:55] MNmichael: now you have to say "These pretzels are making me thirsty"

[2:32:07] Nemm__: The only thing a pretzel needs is a nice, cold beer
[2:32:09] Reckless_Rob: 3 & 4 are fine too
[2:32:10] Mrshilka: or 1942
[2:32:15] ArcaneSyntax: 2 comes after 1 right, right?
[2:32:16] Reckless_Rob: But its popular to hate any Battlefield
[2:32:18] Shoaron: I wish they'd bring back artillery guns
[2:32:19] BossManEazzy: zoomer lol
[2:32:19] 4braxis: I used to lay on wings in 1942
[2:32:22] FayFoFum: Eh, old Battlfield games are overrated, but Battlefield One is definitely not great :)
[2:32:24] Goa_gubben: is pretzels an american thing? I've never seen big ones like that
[2:32:27] JetLi47: i like pretzel the way it is, maybe some coffee & thats it
[2:32:28] WageSqueeze: BF2 and BF 2142 were the all time best, why can't they make it again?
[2:32:28] hellscythe_2319: 2 was the best for me
[2:32:36] peaks102: I enjoyed BF1 but BFV was just a worse 1....plus it looked almost identical and even used the same exact building layouts
[2:32:36] Baludor: They removed it, it was so strong
[2:32:38] Kousa: removed
[2:32:38] sarqon: i don't know any other country that has preztels

[2:32:43] JetLi47: @itmeJP isnt that just a healing gun
[2:32:43] Mey_Raki: Nope...they changed it bc they thought it was OP
[2:32:44] LycanMN: they changed it cuz it was OP
[2:32:44] Baludor: It only heals now

[2:32:55] 4braxis: sinvictaPuff
[2:32:56] Sentinel_Prime_: this game doesn't feel like a battlefield to me. So I will pass on this
[2:32:57] ZirhcM: BF 1 and V got a lot better after some time but their launch was rough
[2:32:58] Mey_Raki: ppl would just get farmed if that happened
[2:33:04] zepillon: Battlefield 4 is the best battlefield in my opinion.
[2:33:09] Reckless_Rob: Your character was a grandma?
[2:33:10] WilTheThrilll: 24/7 wake island on bf2
[2:33:11] Reckless_Rob: Or Geralt
[2:33:12] FayFoFum: @meechall Battlefield 2 dolphin dive meta was a msess

[2:33:37] mechboos: @Shoaron there isnt one LUL
[2:33:37] Nemm__: BF Bad Company 2 best BF
[2:33:43] Baludor: @Shoaron Non medics can only revive their squad. Medics can revive everyone
[2:33:44] pr_necroskull: battlefield hardline was the worst tbh
[2:33:46] JetLi47: @Shoaron isnt it limited to your squad mates ?
[2:33:48] WageSqueeze: bf4 is the only that still have many full serves after launch if you're not from us
[2:33:48] TylerSouth88: that M5 seems popular
[2:33:53] SSJGengar: hardline doesn't exist
[2:33:54] Mrshilka: hardline had great music
[2:33:55] SerCobo: 2142 was my favorite, followed by BC2: Vietnam
[2:34:00] Mrshilka: also funny reloads
[2:34:03] Sentinel_Prime_: I had more fun in hardline beta than in this beta
[2:34:05] Shoaron: are you sure its only limited to squad mates?
[2:34:05] SquidwardTentacles: Hardline was better than 5 burkeShrug
[2:34:06] peaks102: Hardline was them just trying something different.....and failing of course lmao
[2:34:12] brownie_gunner: hardline was trash but it was honestly kinda fun still lol
[2:34:13] ranin: world war 1 was so cool, just bad gunplay :/
[2:34:14] Mrshilka: oh man bf nam had great music too
[2:34:17] delux3247: BF3 was the best to me
[2:34:19] BossManEazzy: if hardline had good maps it be good
[2:34:20] meechall: lol i had some fun in hardline but i feel ya
[2:34:21] Baludor: @Shoaron You could revive everyone in the alpha, if that's where you're getting your info from
[2:34:26] Hexof: hot take
[2:34:28] Shoaron: ah kk
[2:34:29] Mrshilka: whoa whoa
[2:34:29] Reckless_Rob: I think V was way better than 1?
[2:34:30] ShadowsparksTV: @squidwardtentacles Agreed. I liked Hardline more than 1 or 5, honestly.
[2:34:30] WilTheThrilll: @SerCobo 2142 days were fun indeed
[2:34:32] goofball277: BF5 was the worst
[2:34:32] Mrshilka: hot takes
[2:34:36] eazydubzhugz: BF1 best battlefield
[2:34:37] IronBicepss: hahahahahahhaha
[2:34:39] brownie_gunner: bf5 is literally call of duty lol
[2:34:41] conradical93: hardline was very under rated
[2:34:42] JetLi47: hardline never existed chat MiniK
[2:34:46] RoSon_: i feel the same actually.
[2:34:47] SpawnOnMe: @itmejp how are you liking the cross system for your guns?
[2:34:55] peaks102: BC2 was sooo good though....BF4 is up there for me
[2:34:56] draxthos: cohhHi cohhHi
[2:34:57] TheVenomPunk: thats the spiciest take on the BF franchise i think i've ever heard in my life
[2:35:00] BossManEazzy: v wasnt too good
[2:35:01] pr_necroskull: i hated the rpg availability in hardline
[2:35:01] de_zeph: Hardline was better than 4 it just had the same netcode issues and no playerbase after launch
[2:35:03] TylerSouth88: @MajorDuck33 great show....but I wonder if it's aged well.
[2:35:08] zynkarla: dude was just climbing a ladder :(
[2:35:14] brownie_gunner: wrong @Thezephyrim
[2:35:18] Reckless_Rob: You have to shoot it at the ground??
[2:35:23] Mrshilka: @Thezephyrim thats a hot take
[2:35:27] JetLi47: @Thezephyrim hell no
[2:35:28] zepillon: If only you could play as an actual soldier in Battlefield 2042 instead of a god damn specialist.
[2:35:31] goofball277: Hardline just had all flat maps best part of bf is elevation

[2:35:40] Sonatta: @Goa_gubben we have 2 kinds of pretzels... the small kind that you can get in a plastic bag like potato chips... they're hard and crunchy with lots of salt on them, and then the carnival kind which are big, and are more like bread, a harder outside but soft inside, with big salt bits that are good for dipping

[2:37:13] dragothicx: the flickering KEKW
[2:37:15] Baludor: I actually think everyone being a specialist makes it hard to tell who's an enemy at a glance
[2:37:17] RoSon_: Also BF 3 and 4 could've been sooo much better if it wasn't for the atrocious map design of Operation Metro (second half down in the metro) and Operation locker (the whole fucking map).
[2:37:18] RoSon_: they might be top 5 worst map designs I've ever seen
[2:37:22] GymLeaderKevin: its cool that more games are supporting cross play
[2:37:31] Mrshilka: people loved metro

[2:40:16] bretongaming: KEKW
[2:40:18] RoSon_: @Moogles1 Yea they were amazing to level up on but as far as gameplay goes? Choke point extravaganza with a touch of the worst clusterfucks. It was popular because of a lot of kills but that doesn't necessarily make the design any better.
[2:40:26] Sonatta: grapple hook guy Pog
[2:40:26] peaks102: @IronBicepss I played it and it's still my lowest on the list.....doesn't mean I didn't have fun but compared to the rest it is not good

[2:41:00] Jormunduur: What is ammo if not Gun Mana @itmeJP
[2:41:01] ShadowsparksTV: Do you get more ammo if you change your mag?
[2:41:01] JetLi47: @itmeJP you are supposed to die young
[2:41:09] meechall: so wheres this high and mighty tornado
[2:41:11] Moogles1: die usually before then
[2:41:14] Unyates: it spits out ammo so fast u wonder wtf it all goes
[2:41:24] RoSon_: @JetLi47 very true
[2:41:28] WageSqueeze: @IronBicepss I think this bf won't have as many because of easy anti cheat. but nonetheless bf 2042 looks unfinished now
[2:41:28] titanodin: my car D:

[2:41:55] KosmicKing78: ammo box and turret deployment are bugged a lot of the time for me
[2:41:59] peaks102: @WageSqueeze Of course it feels unfinished...it's a beta...that's the point of a beta
[2:42:08] titanodin: if you had a rifle
[2:42:12] Space_Monkey_Mafia: SMGs eat ammo quick

[2:42:30] klojo_: This game looks like a lot of fun with a lobby that doesn't take things too seriously.
[2:42:31] Mrshilka: its bongo cat
[2:42:33] SlipCrit: a pot farm

[2:43:07] WageSqueeze: @Baludor oh I see, but all of the game I played with easy anti cheat was really good
[2:43:10] pedrlz: like the fox and grapes and shit
[2:43:14] furry_wolf2001b: would be cool if they added an npc with a pot you could shoot to get rid of that alert
