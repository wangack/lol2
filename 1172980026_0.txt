[0:23:34] VrtniPatuljak: win11 compatibility is just a scam to sell new computers
[0:23:34] Jukettaja: Yeah just for that feature alone
[0:23:35] sotasty_: ijpHI
[0:23:37] Elievex: Window 11, remember when Window 10 was supposed to be the final version of window

[0:24:03] Jukettaja: All they did was change the version number as far as I understand
[0:24:36] AinzN: Hiding the keyboard would be annoying for artists as they can't use shortcuts
[0:24:52] VrtniPatuljak: Jukettaja they did some security stuff but mostly a new UI, its a scam
[0:24:55] Cooper132: @itmejp you wanna watch the very end of the video too ;)
[0:24:56] Jukettaja: You could have an external keyboard at that point
[0:24:58] MrTrotty: same one he recomended, the verge one
[0:25:02] altizar: I still use windows 7 even if Microsoft reminds me it's fake copy every 10 minutes

[0:25:19] Scientist__: KEKW
[0:25:43] VrtniPatuljak: Jukettaja no, but anything under 8th gen intel is incompatible
[0:25:43] prebenkk64: that is raceme
[0:25:45] Scientist__: you upgrade for free if you have win 10
[0:25:49] skythe00: NotLikeThis
[0:25:57] Jukettaja: I got the impression that Windows 11 was solely added to keep up interest with Apple releases.
[0:26:16] Jukettaja: Oh I suppose they did change the UI
[0:26:23] NoorElBahrain: it is very KDE plasma
[0:26:25] skythe00: oh look... apps zekeSTARE
[0:26:28] VrtniPatuljak: Jukettaja maybe, but also to sell new pcs, lots of ppl have 3y old ones that cant upgrade
[0:26:36] Vaylufa: That recommended part can just dissapear please LUL
[0:26:43] Krohnikal: I wonder if they cut more stuff from the setting/control panel. or hid more to be clearer
[0:26:48] skythe00: know what i like, the start menu
[0:26:50] Miros__: "A launcher for your apps" HOW REVOLUTIONARY
[0:26:53] Jukettaja: If you can run windows 10, you can't upgrade to 11?
[0:26:57] VrtniPatuljak: thank god
[0:26:58] Nyx187: "hey, we made it easier for installed viruses to hide from you ever finding them"

[0:28:32] Crosseye_Jack: @BlazeRom all the time when I want to open a file in a perticular editor I want to use
[0:28:36] ZeroDjinn: never used them
[0:28:37] Vili_Borrson: Same
[0:28:38] Shapelessdnb: I never use this
[0:28:39] Lutcha81: same
[0:28:40] Scientist__: same
[0:28:40] arimaythea: I don't use them either
[0:28:42] Krohnikal: I try to just remove then from view entirely
[0:28:43] WhiteMilk89: same
[0:28:43] Vaylufa: I only use widgets on phone, battery and weather thing. Not on PC
[0:28:44] novafreez3: same
[0:28:46] 4pr0mille: I want as little on my screen as possible.
[0:28:46] skythe00: no point to them on my PC
[0:28:46] MSPaintEnthusiast: bring back windows xp Sadge
[0:28:46] RK_Crown: Never used them
[0:28:48] BranBirb: same.... not on the desktop
[0:28:50] Crosseye_Jack: @BlazeRom however I'm a power suer
[0:28:50] The_Shift_Key: I use them on android but never my PC
[0:28:51] Thanangard: widgets are so unneccessary
[0:28:53] WilliamKurokami: I have a single one for multiple timezones but that's it
[0:28:53] Sir_Myrmidon: explicitly turned off, its just to farm data
[0:28:56] BlazeRom: @Crosseye_Jack fair enough, guess it's faster than right clicking or setting it as default
[0:28:58] Nyx187: windows vista ruined widgets for me forever
[0:29:01] Temu1982: I always do my outmost to get them to annoy me as little as possible
[0:29:01] Tervan: every new installation i spend hours to deinstall most of the "features" and "widgest"
[0:29:02] SEye6: Same i just try to remove them all the time and they keep comeing back
[0:29:02] SoulEroder: that is more the ad area to be honest
[0:29:10] Krohnikal: only thing I use technically is postit notes on screen
[0:29:11] serriejane: first thing i get rid of
[0:29:13] skythe00: GROSS
[0:29:14] pa_TIENce: ew
[0:29:16] TETLegion: the only one i am using is the weather and calendar widget on my phone and nothing else. no widget on pc ad atll
[0:29:18] BlazeRom: DansGame Edge
[0:29:20] ZeroDjinn: thats a nope
[0:29:22] Krohnikal: helps me manage stuff since I'm usually at my pc.
[0:29:23] Scientist__: ijpNOPERS
[0:29:24] MSPaintRose: edge is chromium now
[0:29:26] Vaylufa: New Edge is nice, but i hate that bing start menu search
[0:29:26] Truder2k: widgets hidden away in a menu does not make any sense, and never did.... apple did/does the same
[0:29:26] EndyBT: damn the drag and drop into another application in the taskbar missing is a very big issue for me :/
[0:29:27] ShrowdArrow: ugh
[0:29:28] BlazeRom: Edge is not bad to be fair
[0:29:29] Thanangard: woops, thats a killer.
[0:29:32] NoorElBahrain: I use gnome extensions which I guess are kinda widgets
[0:29:33] BlazeRom: It's basically a chromium
[0:29:39] epicshoo: D: 📣 so we heard you hate edge? here it is!
[0:29:49] WATERMELONFRESH: Edge is chromium LUL
[0:29:49] WindowLickr: Edge basically is Chrome 4Head
[0:29:50] 4pr0mille: I prefeer Firefox
[0:29:54] pa_TIENce: let the user decide their browser
[0:29:55] WilliamKurokami: oh, people will doctor so long that chrome will be the actual standard again
[0:30:01] Krohnikal: what happened to Ms just stopping the browser stuff?
[0:30:04] BlazeRom: can Edge have the extensions from chrome now?
[0:30:06] Shapelessdnb: Still on Firefox
[0:30:07] Miros__: I mean, who does web searches from their start menu anyway?
[0:30:09] Krohnikal: thought they were gonna bow out
[0:30:10] WilliamKurokami: they'll rip this apart and stitch it back together
[0:30:17] WindowLickr: @BlazeRom, yes
[0:30:22] Jukettaja: Only ever used Teams for work
[0:30:23] Marrowleaf: @BlazeRom yeah
[0:30:29] BlazeRom: @WindowLickr @Marrowleaf might test it again then
[0:30:30] DoctorJohn: stripLUrk
[0:30:34] altizar: That got them into lefgal trouble in the internet explorer days
[0:30:36] DoctorJohn: stripLurk
[0:30:36] Lutcha81: not true, most of the EU use teams in companies
[0:30:36] MSPaintEnthusiast: the first thing I did
[0:30:39] Vaylufa: For work its nice, but private nah
[0:30:45] Crosseye_Jack: @BlazeRom I dislike "set as default" for example, I use both VSCode and VisualStudio, I don't always want to open a C file in Visual Studio. Often quicker to just drag the file on the editor I want to use at that moment in time

[0:31:14] SignGuyBubsy: the snap is good
[0:31:20] Krohnikal: oh that's nice.
[0:31:20] Vaylufa: KEKW
[0:31:25] VrtniPatuljak: win11 has direct storage. that ps5 ssd magic, so thats 1 good thing
[0:31:28] skythe00: LUL
[0:31:29] Kaelain: Can you finally center a window on the screen though LUL
[0:31:30] Krohnikal: I usually just do the throw method
[0:31:37] Darkaros: That's really nice, I never remember win10's snap keyboard shortcut
[0:31:51] Lutcha81: i just use shortcuts for this .. windows keys and arrows
[0:31:51] Cygnatus: NOPERS
[0:31:54] BlazeRom: LUL
[0:32:11] BlazeRom: it's very nice for a big screen
[0:32:29] BlazeRom: what I would love for them to do is to somehow fake fullscreen a specific area of the monitor
[0:32:35] BlazeRom: and have side apps opened
[0:32:35] Lutcha81: nice Darkaros perfect timing for our messages :D
[0:32:39] BlazeRom: if you have the big screen
[0:32:55] MSPaintEnthusiast: you could press the windows key + arrows to instant align
[0:32:59] Krohnikal: I'm still curious ms has been slowly removing or moving stuff from the back end of menus for the system and I'm curious if they are doing more of that in 11
[0:33:12] MSPaintRose: that's way faster that win 10
[0:33:16] Darkaros: The Windows key is evil and the less I use it the better
[0:33:25] SweCap: Remember when Edge couldn't even remember what window size it was closed in the next time you launched? This is an improvement LUL
[0:33:31] BlazeRom: I'm still perplexed as to why they changed the name to 11, they said 10 would be the last didn't they?
[0:33:36] Truder2k: good ol' MS giving another stab at redoing their settings menus... and it gets progressively more crap for each go...
[0:33:46] Crosseye_Jack: @BlazeRom They never said that
[0:33:52] samiwamiAEYOE: 11 launched?
[0:34:01] Scientist__: ijpWTF ijpWTF
[0:34:07] Vaylufa: I'm so annoyed they removed or hid the option to let all icons on the taskbar show all the time.
[0:34:10] Sedge1987: rounded windows apple inspired seems like
[0:34:11] sneakypooo: Just give me the old settings. I hate the new version, it's so... "bulky"

[0:34:24] Mallatom: WutFace
[0:34:25] BlazeRom: @Crosseye_Jack guess I remembered it wrong
[0:34:25] Crosseye_Jack: @BlazeRom what they did say was windows 10 was a shift to having windows as a "service" that gets often updates over the old service packs
[0:34:26] Infidel_Art: WutFace
[0:34:28] afreak10: monkaW Light

[0:34:40] BlazeRom: @Crosseye_Jack ah okay
[0:34:41] Nyx187: a man of culture, only using dark mode
[0:34:49] Krohnikal: i just eant to be able to go into settings and not have to click 10 different times to get to where I need to go

[0:35:07] NoorElBahrain: NiloxofAsgard ijpBOOP
[0:35:11] rarelybroken: I still Hope they add more themes so you would be able to have win95- 10 as themes so it changes the whole look but will probably never happen.
[0:35:14] GrannySith: I mean, this has been a  thing forever. They're notorious about keeping old dialogs around.
[0:35:15] afreak10: Phone controls
[0:35:17] BlazeRom: it looks so...mobile-ish
[0:35:19] BlazeRom: doesn't it
[0:35:23] BlazeRom: the user interface
[0:35:24] Vili_Borrson: So Win 11 is an incomplete UI update? stripHmm
[0:35:27] RhodesToRome: Windows Store KEKLEO
[0:35:36] radamee: probably still terrible
[0:35:37] MSPaintEnthusiast: the one problem that always been in windows on every version they've released is the inconsistency
[0:35:39] Sheal88: as someone with low vision, fuck MS for their handling of stuff like dark mode and those old ass UI settings
[0:35:52] BlazeRom: waiting for that android update
[0:35:56] Darkaros: ijpSUFFER windows store. Never again after pso2
[0:35:59] Truder2k: @Vili_Borrson as is tradition
[0:36:10] Lutcha81: if i have to login to there store with my MS account they can F... off
[0:36:14] Krohnikal: half the reason why I never stuck with game pass
[0:36:14] Vili_Borrson: @Truder2k I suppose LUL
[0:36:24] Z3r0Fear: I can finally play mobile games on pc!
[0:36:27] Lutcha81: their*
[0:36:27] MSPaintRose: tiktok pog
[0:36:28] Sheal88: keep mobile out of my OS
[0:36:37] BlazeRom: pretty cool to not have to use bluestacks for some stuff
[0:36:40] Krohnikal: that and an outer worlds bug that wouldn't let me beat the game
[0:36:56] afreak10: prob the biggest thing im interested
[0:36:59] radamee: pokketHMM
[0:37:02] skythe00: thats cool
[0:37:04] hirtza1: looks like it isn't glitching literally 100% of the time woah
[0:37:04] MSPaintEnthusiast: the first thing should everyone do after installing windows 11 or windows 10 is to install PowerToys immediately, it'll make your life much easier
[0:37:21] Z3r0Fear: whats powertoys?
[0:37:34] Dr4gonb0rn_: notepad plus plus ftw
[0:37:36] Yaxl1: notepad++ is best notepad
[0:37:37] Crosseye_Jack: @Darkaros BAsically the new store is a UI for WinGet, MS's package manager, which is how they have finally managed to get devs to use it. Basically its easy as heck to release your app on it,
[0:37:43] Goa_gubben: ++ master app
[0:37:44] Krohnikal: this is nice though. waiting in customer support at ikea for a third time to finall get all the parts to my nightstand I bought last week LUL
[0:37:51] Kaleith: it's a microsoft app
[0:37:51] skythe00: LUL
[0:37:51] Z3r0Fear: oh ok
[0:37:52] GrannySith: PowerToys is actually a first party app.
[0:37:55] Z3r0Fear: thank you
[0:37:57] Kaleith: or rather suite of tools
[0:38:00] MSPaintRose: so pretty
[0:38:16] OnePunchMac: Windows 11 needs new piece of hardware @itmeJP
[0:38:18] Kaleith: LuvSign jp
[0:38:19] Krohnikal: so this Is helping keep my cool
[0:38:20] WilliamKurokami: pretty much a side project from Microsoft devs
[0:38:27] Truder2k: I wonder if they will stick to the tradition of tick-tocking between a good windows version countered by a crap one
[0:38:40] BlazeRom: (x) doubt
[0:38:40] dragothicx: Kapp
[0:38:43] Krohnikal: cause man 30 minute plus wait each time. on the third time I'm a bit steamed
[0:38:45] Crosseye_Jack: @OnePunchMac needs a "recent" CPU or a TPM, or a modified installer :-P
[0:38:48] JBfromAccounting: i upgraded, and so far I'm actually loving it
[0:38:48] Z3r0Fear: That 4GB ram requirement is something I'm going to need more ram in my PC to keep games running well.
[0:38:51] WindowLickr: DirectStorage
[0:39:01] Crosseye_Jack: @OnePunchMac you can install 11 without a TPM, though a few things don't work (yet)
[0:39:02] JeXus1985: HDR in windows is so fucking crap, I hate it
[0:39:09] Krohnikal: feels more like an overhaul of 10 than a new os entirely
[0:39:12] BlazeRom: LUL
[0:39:16] Scientist__: Pog
[0:39:17] Nobleprinceps: It's great for *gaming* fellow kids!
[0:39:21] yrvengalied: its just a Slap Ad for them to try to get people to get Win 11

[0:39:31] BlazeRom: 17 minutes? 1 hour frame by frame breakdown
[0:39:43] Sedge1987: runs bejewled at a perfect 4k 144hz
[0:39:46] MSPaintEnthusiast: the only nice thing in Windows is the integration of linux subsystem
[0:39:53] bearonvonbear: Destiny doogComfy
[0:39:57] TyrealStratos: no
[0:40:05] SweCap: Windows 11 should be avoided for now if you have an AMD cpu... Looses up ti 20% performance according to AMD
[0:40:08] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1447246690491187209
[0:40:10] 4pr0mille: My CPU is as quick as a i5 11400f, but too old to work with Win10. Weird support.
[0:40:20] 4pr0mille: *11
[0:40:32] Goa_gubben: I might actually get linux finally
[0:40:37] skythe00: zekeS
[0:40:39] OnePunchMac: @Crosseye_Jack The TMP looks like a problem
[0:40:46] BlueBloodBlues: it is not about speed
[0:40:46] BlazeRom: windows 11 on toasters whe
[0:40:49] BlazeRom: when*
[0:40:50] GlasMondTV: Up to 20% less performance in games I heard from LTT.
[0:40:50] Crosseye_Jack: @OnePunchMac https://github.com/AveYo/MediaCreationTool.bat Problem solved
[0:40:56] Moohirim: yeah my cpu is not supported :D
[0:41:04] Marrowleaf: @Moohirim mine either
[0:41:05] MrTrotty: @4pr0mille apparently you can bypass the TPM2.0 requirement if you really wanted to
[0:41:06] gobbleractually: 11 requires a tpm proccesor addition
[0:41:07] poooookey: can't run win11 on my 5y old laptop
[0:41:08] Nunnoh: even though my specs are all above minimum my physical CPU is too to be accepted, fail
[0:41:13] canadianbryan: 11 doesn't support the AMD Ryzen 5 2500U I have, only 2 years old.
[0:41:13] rarelybroken: IIRC Laptops require A webcam too but that might have been changed.
[0:41:19] Lutcha81: its a shiny win 10 :D
[0:41:20] Krohnikal: I always wait I out until the bitter end for OS LUL
[0:41:23] NoorElBahrain: @Goa_gubben I have it on my laptop and I love it. Main desktop still on win10 coz some apps will not run on linux ijpCRY
[0:41:25] JBfromAccounting: is that because of the VBS? I haven't had any kind of performance loss since upgrading
[0:41:30] skythe00: i dont remember that
[0:41:38] BlazeRom: beta version, got it
[0:41:40] Kaleith: @rarelybroken many requirements like that are for new products if they want to be sold with windows 11 preinstalled
[0:41:43] 4pr0mille: @4pr0mille O ok, ill check on that. Thanx for the detail
[0:41:45] OnePunchMac: So lipstick on a pig
[0:41:46] WilliamKurokami: there's a pretty good app called "WhyNotWin11" which can tell you if your PC is ready for it
[0:41:50] hirtza1: @GlasMondTV on pre-built machines with a security feature enabled
[0:41:53] Goa_gubben: @Goa_gubben does ffxiv run on linux?
[0:42:01] YosefYoStar: How goes the descent into the madness that is league of legends?
[0:42:04] Scientist__: i switch from ryzen 3600 to 5600x for like 50 euro
[0:42:14] Sonatta: sounds like we're waiting until windows 12 LUL
[0:42:22] gobbleractually: never upgrade windows to new version till you have to because its always bad
[0:42:29] Crosseye_Jack: As someone who has used windows for decades. There is a rule with windows, Run it, Skip it.
[0:42:30] dragothicx: No windows 11 until 2025 then LUL
[0:42:31] BlazeRom: of course, it's always good, bad, good, pattern with Windows releases
[0:42:38] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[0:42:38] 4pr0mille: I thought however "Windows 10 is tha last Microsoft update, we will now only update"
[0:42:39] Lutcha81: i guess main problem is people expect to use legacy stuff forever and windows have to support that
[0:42:39] afreak10: NODDERS NODDERS Holdddd
[0:42:40] Crosseye_Jack: so run 7, skip 8, run 10, skip 11
[0:42:43] skythe00: thats pretty much what i was gonna do anyway zekeDERP
[0:42:51] Infidel_Art: i'm looking forward to upgrading, didn't regret getting windows 10 early
[0:42:51] GraveSalad: Man, I need more anti-cheat to support Linux and I can finally switch full time to manjaro
[0:42:52] Miros__: Welp, my processor isn't supported.  darn shucks.
[0:43:01] Krohnikal: I just have it set up perfectly to the way I like it and upgrading always resets a lot of those comforts I have in place
[0:43:09] NoorElBahrain: @Goa_gubben I have not tried but you can check how other players run it here https://www.protondb.com/app/39210
[0:43:19] GrannySith: Love it when big, established corporations release essentially unfinished products. YEP
[0:43:19] Sonatta: yeah the TMP 2.0 requirement denies A LOT of pcs the upgrade to Windows 11
[0:43:23] Riluske: I have an amd so I def won't be
[0:43:27] Krohnikal: and I'm usually good about security and what not
[0:43:31] Jerbsinator: Is the upgrade free like it was for a while for 10?
[0:43:35] Crosseye_Jack: @Sonatta https://github.com/AveYo/MediaCreationTool.bat And like magic ITS GONE

[0:43:50] Crosseye_Jack: but yeah, I went back to windows 10, 11 just annoyed me too much
[0:43:50] gobbleractually: some stuff its still beta not worth getting
[0:43:57] WilliamKurokami: I will upgrade to Win 11 in 6 months at the earliest. everyone else can find the bugs and work out the kinnks cohhLUL
[0:43:59] Sonatta: @Crosseye_Jack lol i knew about that but most pc users aren't going to

[0:46:36] Krohnikal: yeah I just replaced my s7 due to it having battery issues and major slowdowns
[0:46:39] 4pr0mille: Every part in it is bound to the phone. So you must repair it at Apple. And why wouldnt you, since ya already paid $2000 for the phone.
[0:46:39] PangurBanTheCat: My phone is 5 years old. Still works great. lol

[0:48:15] shadowoflight_: fandroids wouldn't know the difference

[0:49:01] Z3r0Fear: @Goa_gubben my phones wifi is going down the drain to the point that I have to use LTE network in order to even use the phone online. I'm being forced to change to a new phone because the past 4 years of me getting 2 new phones that they fail every time it gets near the 2 year contract mark when ending.

[0:50:57] MSPaintRose: i disagree
[0:51:00] Dr4gonb0rn_: what us pc nerds have to deal with - its true
[0:51:04] NitramEjrot7: same with monitors
[0:51:08] canadianbryan: ollywood?
[0:51:08] MSPaintRose: although i'm not married to my phone
[0:51:08] GraveSalad: and that's why I'm stuck buying expensive monitors from now on....
[0:51:17] BlazeRom: you won't go back to 30 fps after playing at 60
[0:51:20] rAKAye: why would you want text to remain crisp when speed scrolling...
[0:51:23] Krohnikal: only thing I miss is the sd card slot cause I like the availability of storage and headphone jack
[0:51:23] PangurBanTheCat: I barely notice when I go from 60 to 120hz, but when I go back it's weirdly more noticeable.
[0:51:23] Dr4gonb0rn_: after playing pc at high fps consoles are yuck!
[0:51:25] GrannySith: People wouldn't notice. Just like gamers don't notice when a game is 30 FPS nowadays. Kappa
[0:51:27] zynessa: Even windows feels laggy if you switch from 120 to 60. Your mouse will feel super laggy.
[0:51:28] TyrealStratos: @Krohnikal Neat thx rooIsee
[0:51:30] DrTazerFace: I doubt it makes that much difference.
[0:51:35] 4pr0mille: My eyes are crap. I have a 144hz monitor at home and a 60hz at work. i dont notice it
[0:51:36] TylerSouth88: reminds me of when people switched from 720p to 1080p. They didn't notice at first but after a while 720 looked bad.
[0:51:38] BlazeRom: @rAKAye to spot things easily as you do that
[0:51:44] Goa_gubben: but you play on a monitor. if you dont play on the phone, would you even notice?
[0:51:52] Borhast: Borhast subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[0:51:52] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Borhast! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:52:06] Krohnikal: had to buy a phone case that protects the camera cause I have bad luck with them
[0:52:10] tglenn: I only noticed refresh rate until I games on my PC for a while. and when I went back to console, then I visibly noticed
[0:52:12] GraveSalad: @4pr0mille the change in environment changes your perception. I never noticed till I started working from home. Brains are weird like that
[0:52:14] skythe00: honestly i like my phones a little thicc
[0:52:19] rAKAye: @BlazeRom I can't already read a static screen phone, I'm old
[0:52:28] iilu: Dope results bro
[0:52:37] yrvengalied: WOW The new phone needs to lose some weight Kappa

[0:52:39] NoorElBahrain: using grams ijpCLAP Clap
[0:52:41] sneakypooo: 20grams is nothing. Hand someone that phone, take it away for a minute and hand them a lighter one. No way they'll notice.
[0:52:42] kitsune_ss: nuts
[0:52:42] Shrimp_Parm: dope, sick, mcnasty
[0:52:42] Lutcha81: if you have to measure it to notice the difference, does it really matter ?
[0:52:47] AlphaPrimaryOne: theres drugs in the batteries?
[0:52:50] rarelybroken: 13 pro max ultra is the next one is my guess.
[0:52:50] GrannySith: dog butt!
[0:52:54] MSPaintEnthusiast: apple phones are good if only cheaper KEKW
[0:52:56] Crosseye_Jack: DOGBUTT

[0:53:48] fruit_of_doom: he has a relaxing voice
[0:53:49] skythe00: dang
[0:53:53] rarelybroken: I hate that that is the "new style" always hated the bumps.
[0:54:02] tiberiom: Camera bumps are Girthy
[0:54:06] Goa_gubben: wont the camera catch on stuff?
[0:54:07] dragothicx: why don't phones put camera in the middle of the top of the back of the phone for increased stability though (at least slightly)
[0:54:09] skythe00: but then that can sell you a case to smooth it out
[0:54:18] murasaur: delica chamonix
[0:54:19] 4pr0mille: O en Hasselblad.
[0:54:24] yrvengalied: That is one Sick FLy LUL
[0:54:28] BlazeRom: hope we get to the point where under display cameras become a thing also on the back
[0:54:35] DoctorJohn: AI bokeh is definitely getting better, but it's still very subtle on phones
[0:54:35] BlazeRom: just, no more bulges
[0:54:36] Crosseye_Jack: @rarelybroken Same, I always get a case that levels otu the bumps, and I'm always wondering "Does my phone need to be that thin?"
[0:54:51] Z3r0Fear: @Goa_gubben yeah it sucks having this happen constantly. I'm waiting to hear of news for the new google pixel phone. I wished microsoft kept making phones but things change.
[0:54:52] ITF_: remember when phones had 1 camera, no forehead notch and a headphone jack? KEKW
[0:54:57] TyrealStratos: well finally they got camera´s done right, apple have had shit cameraes for along time
[0:54:59] skythe00: ENHANCE
[0:55:08] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1447246690491187209
[0:55:11] TylerSouth88: @dragothicx maybe the speaker gets in the way? So it might make the camera thicker maybe.
[0:55:16] YosefYoStar: LEAGUE WHEN?
[0:55:17] BlazeRom: LUL
[0:55:24] Krohnikal: only reason I hate no headphone jack is having more things to remember of they are charged
[0:55:27] MSPaintEnthusiast: the s21 ultra camera is so good
[0:55:30] Crosseye_Jack: @rarelybroken the issue I have is bending, my 6s bend around the sim tray cause its (imo) too thin.
[0:55:41] NoorElBahrain: YosefYoStar soonTM
[0:55:43] ReginaldXIV: I have the s21 ultra
[0:55:45] rarelybroken: @Crosseye_Jack Exactly! if they just made it a bit bigger you would get rid of the bump and maybe (maybe) add bigger batteries
[0:55:46] ReginaldXIV: It's pretty good
[0:55:56] BlazeRom: it's annoying, but ever since I got my wireless ear buds I've been converted successfully
[0:56:00] Z3r0Fear: @Goa_gubben I'm moving away from samsung phones because thats the ones I keep having issues with within 2 years of having the phone.
[0:56:03] BlazeRom: don't feel like I need a headphone jack
[0:56:11] Shapelessdnb: Sick for texture samples
[0:56:12] zynessa: That's insanely good.
[0:56:13] CamberCYM: what the shit
[0:56:14] MSPaintEnthusiast: that's really good
[0:56:25] GrannySith: For some reason, Marques always feels like he's doing his videos in one take. All the editing is so smooth.
[0:56:25] PangurBanTheCat: Actually impressive
[0:56:34] furry_wolf2001b: dam
[0:56:34] rarelybroken: @Crosseye_Jack Yea wasnt there some phones that were so thin they broke in the pocket or something?
[0:56:40] DoctorJohn: LUL
[0:56:42] titanodin: my phone does very detailed close pics
[0:56:43] Krohnikal: I agree now that I managed to snag a decent brand of wireless buds that stay in my ears
[0:56:46] Goa_gubben: @Z3r0Fear I've been happy with my Pixel but I don't use it much.
[0:56:48] DoctorJohn: dont worry bro i also take lots of close up photos
[0:56:54] NoorElBahrain: I like the stock android experience, so I am just using pixel phones
[0:56:57] BlazeRom: why isn't that from the start there
[0:56:59] BlazeRom: weird
[0:57:02] YosefYoStar: Loooool big rip
[0:57:15] Jukettaja: I'll wait for the day I can get a clear picture of the moon with my phone
[0:57:16] GrannySith: Those weren't stars, those were light bulbs. Kappa
[0:57:21] Crosseye_Jack: @rarelybroken Yeah a few of their models either fail completly or a chip around the bend leaves the board and so something fails.
[0:57:23] countmarcula: imagine seeing stars in NYC
[0:57:29] countmarcula: lolwat
[0:57:43] MSPaintEnthusiast: monkaHmm
[0:57:55] BlazeRom: ijpKEK
[0:58:16] countmarcula: that'd be nice. ProRes files are massive though
[0:58:17] rarelybroken: @Crosseye_Jack that so dumb LUL they should just make them a tiny bit bigger instead of the ultra thin stuff
[0:58:19] TyrealStratos: i know what would make better videos. NOT using apple products
[0:58:28] Crosseye_Jack: @rarelybroken forexample in the 6s its accelerometers are next to the sim tray, so if the phone bends it can still work, but you loose auto rotation (and measurements if you ever used them)
[0:58:45] Sonatta: are professionals "in the industry" really using iphones for video footage that needs need to 120hz?
[0:58:45] tiberiom: 1080p30 ruuPuke

[1:00:33] BlazeRom: I hope the EU succeeds in forcing Apple to switch to Type C
[1:00:41] Darkaros: YAPPP You know what has higher refresh rate than this 120hz phone? A 144hz monitor! I know you were asking about phones but it's true!
[1:00:46] ZcottD: im still amazed by 1 TB thumb drives
[1:00:47] Crosseye_Jack: @ReginaldXIV Still have my IG Razr around the place somewhere
[1:00:53] Sonatta: it's only in white? WutFace
[1:01:03] zerohour_88: I wonder if Apple ever adapts USB-C, will we still need special cables for it
[1:01:06] Xorkrik: Is apple racist ? Kappa
[1:01:06] ReginaldXIV: NGAGE GANG
[1:01:18] rarelybroken: @Crosseye_Jack Whaaat. I was worried about my oneplus 7 camera but never had any issues with it.
[1:01:25] Crosseye_Jack: HECK @ReginaldXIV I still have my StarTAC somewhere in the loft
[1:01:28] BlazeRom: @zerohour_88 they will probably do what Nintendo did, allow only specific devices through it

[1:45:27] DoggyP0O: if you see a low level playing yasuo 100% a smurf. probably a silver smurf tho
[1:45:35] Nurama: @itmeJP how od you feel about the lack of turn speed in the moba genre? a good or bad change in your opinion?
[1:45:38] Ozoaken: you're always in smurf land
[1:45:54] Jukettaja: Can you be a smurf in draft pick? Nobody has a rank anyway
[1:46:07] iZaloth: At least Sylas has 5 ults to take that are all useful
[1:46:08] Jukettaja: How did that term even come about?

[1:46:57] afreak10: it happens when u get invested

[1:47:49] Jukettaja: Even so League is far less stressful than Dota in my experience because you can at least end it in 15 minutes
[1:48:05] Qutini: are those timers, on the map, there when you get higher in lvl too?
[1:48:06] GraveSalad: once you're in the "know" point it'll come. This is just the blissful ignorance stage. Even Crendor gets tilted at this. And that man still plays Blood Bowl

[1:54:22] the_real_beardcat: yo chat, did JP make any comments about playing Metroid Dread?
[1:54:26] DoggyP0O: @Qutini would be really weird to back right before the huge wave gets to him
[1:54:30] iZaloth: This Seraphine is actually kinda garbage tbh, she should used her double E root instead of double Q, woulda caught both of you
[1:54:32] adrianlibri: that was a great sylas move

[1:54:35] Bloodyscar: Seeing you play League makes me want to start to play league. but its league and i'm scared.
[1:54:40] jjonnej: no assists on that :(

[1:54:46] zombo_com: xerath support only
[1:54:53] Qutini: @DoggyP0O ye thats why I wrote once he managed to push his lane

[1:57:16] DoggyP0O: @Qutini no, the wave just reset after it crashed
[1:57:39] sydneyspencer98: @Goa_gubben Because some people want the instant gratification of number go up, and it's hard to affect your rank when you have a lot of games on your account (not saying this is a good approach but I know people who think this way)
[1:57:43] ApathyOwl: peepoJAMMER

These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[1:59:16] pa_TIENce: This is basically a win
[1:59:17] jjonnej: you gonna wath worlds tomorrow @itmeJP
[1:59:20] pa_TIENce: Oh wait
[1:59:22] AinzN: hypeE ADS hypeE
[1:59:32] Crosseye_Jack: PRAISE DA ADS
[1:59:33] fruit_of_doom: you got this <3
[1:59:49] JeXus1985: so close
[1:59:59] AinzN: Sivir does a lot of damage
[2:00:06] jjonnej: by watching ads you not only support US capitalism and help make the rich richer, but you also support the moderators!
[2:00:28] Crosseye_Jack: @jjonnej Noor needs her k-pop fix
[2:00:29] DoggyP0O: wot
[2:00:39] Crosseye_Jack: why wont anyone think of noors k-pop fix!
[2:00:46] AinzN: jjonnej need to help out Streamer 307
[2:01:03] Qutini: wtf is that Coke ad xD
[2:01:25] Crosseye_Jack: good coke? or drinkable coke @Qutini
[2:01:36] AinzN: Crosseye_Jack we do think about Noor's K-Pop fix that's why we need to have an intervention about it
[2:01:38] Saliqua: Super cringe coke add LUL
[2:01:38] Qutini: the drinkable one ;)
[2:02:00] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN leats its not smack.
[2:02:05] Crosseye_Jack: least*
[2:02:13] AinzN: Crosseye_Jack smack might be cheaper LUL
[2:02:18] Nunnoh: i didnt get coke i got the ugly Levis sweats
[2:02:18] pa_TIENce: Also why does he expect an adc to flank
[2:02:20] Crosseye_Jack: rather have noor hooked on kpop than smack
[2:02:33] Crosseye_Jack: @AinzN lol. fair point
[2:02:35] Nurama: use the time stone to go back in time and not get behind in farm i guess? idk people can be silly
[2:02:35] janiwia: is strippin going to join later?
[2:02:47] hirtza1: really need to get out of the habit of using E like that
[2:02:57] Merandil: So, JP going to try out botlane for a while and then the others oooor?
[2:03:08] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[2:03:09] RhodesToRome: You can't be seen around a #451. It'll ruin your image
[2:03:10] MewZilla: really good effort
[2:03:38] epicshoo: wont worry, the team will still blame you somehow ijpMONKA
[2:03:42] pa_TIENce: It’s a good trade
[2:03:52] Slittyfungus: No One:                Coke advertising execs: ridiculous cgi gamer ad
[2:04:03] fruit_of_doom: your score is still pretty good
[2:04:08] Slittyfungus: then they get mad we dont like it
[2:04:15] AinzN: So do kills matter in League compared to Dota?
[2:04:19] Qutini: ye your score is totally ok
[2:04:25] Crosseye_Jack: @Slittyfungus wait, you saw the ad?
[2:04:30] pa_TIENce: Destroy inhib this early is kinda bad tho
[2:04:35] Slittyfungus: yea on jerichos stream
[2:04:40] Slittyfungus: the full one too
[2:04:48] Crosseye_Jack: oh... I thought ads werre busted for a min]
[2:04:52] nakata545: @pa_TIENce not mid, usually thats true for side lanes
[2:04:56] MewZilla: love the mf skin btw
[2:05:02] nakata545: mid inhib down early is so much free space on the map
[2:05:09] Slittyfungus: lol i just saw ppl talkin bout it
[2:05:09] Darkaros: Thanks to da viewers for da skins stripAdore
[2:05:12] Nurama: @nakata545 its also a ton of exp and gold for the enemy team
[2:05:13] Qutini: @AinzN not as much I think, Like JP said before he began playing, he had a game where a guy got superfed but his team still lost
[2:05:19] AinzN: ijpCHEER Thanks you viewer! ijpCHEER
[2:05:37] MewZilla: i'm biased but viewers are pretty pog
[2:05:58] Derilich: cool to see how JP is playing from 6 days ago, comes down to knowing what your champ is capable of and jp shows good game sense Hmm i find adc to be hardest role to play
[2:06:08] MewZilla: have mained adc for a long time and yea... it's not fun sometimes lol
[2:06:22] Merandil: ADCs are a very volatile role in this game, they blow up SUPER faster
[2:06:25] Whatnos: if the support picks yuumi, then the adc is the support. Your new job is getting yuumi to a decent level
[2:06:29] Merandil: But also can have silly damages
[2:06:31] Nurama: theres a few adcs that can be left alone, vayne, xayah, ezreal
[2:06:37] Nurama: they are good at self peelings
[2:06:43] Booba__TV: LUL its cuz every bruiser in this game can 2 shots adc
[2:06:45] Joitch: You can also go for the lane/jungle duo
[2:06:46] Merandil: Hey, top works good for duo too, if your partner is a jungler or mid
[2:06:49] titanodin: yuumis normaly jump on assassins because they are more "fun"
[2:06:50] Buttdorf: i always just Supported it was fun with duo's
[2:06:52] pa_TIENce: Usually around this time, adc stays mid to farm. But you have tris in mid
[2:06:55] Tenagra: mid or top can be fun duo if one of you is the jungler
[2:07:00] Jukettaja: Either your ADC has enough mobility or enough damage to solo
[2:07:03] fraggleroctv: There are more self-sufficient adcs such as Senna
[2:07:11] MewZilla: Sylas yuumi will end them all xD
[2:07:13] nakata545: sylas yuumi is really gross
[2:07:13] sydneyspencer98: Yeah ADC's don't usually benefit from hanging around in lane too long because they just get jumped on
[2:07:14] nerscyllathrilla: In fairness, that is the champ that Yumi wants to sit in this match. Sylas is best champ for her to be on, for the exact reason that just happened
[2:07:16] DoggyP0O: mf is plenty self sufficient cus she can just ult
[2:07:21] GingerMiike: top and jungle duo could be good if you wanted to switch it up
[2:07:25] afreak10: pretty fast baron
[2:07:26] Jukettaja: A couple of AD champions can still manage on their own but most don't
[2:07:30] Derilich: sam is like maximum you punch me i punch you, so he was born for top lol
[2:07:39] Jukettaja: And even the ones that do shouldn't really solo anyway
[2:07:53] Qutini: @itmeJP you could play top with MF, this early you can generally get away with it. I have played MF top Casually
[2:08:03] Booba__TV: you can top/jungle mid/jungle too as duo
[2:08:10] nerscyllathrilla: Trist is another option that has a few really strong disengage tools
[2:08:36] Joitch: KEKW
[2:08:40] Jukettaja: Yeah I think my favourite duos have been with a solo lane and jungle comp.
[2:08:48] Qutini: they are just hunting kills now xD
[2:09:12] DoggyP0O: luckily yone isn't good. Trist was probably just being stupid in lane
[2:09:17] Saliqua: They wont be able to end, even with you. You are doing the right thing
[2:09:18] MewZilla: LUL
[2:09:20] AinzN: PauseChamp
[2:09:22] Derilich: nah yuumi giving like half hp heals now
[2:09:22] nerscyllathrilla: Well Sylas also ditched them
[2:09:24] Valkireon: sylas backed
[2:09:27] pa_TIENce: Sylas backed
[2:09:30] nerscyllathrilla: ANd he's your entire team right now
[2:09:31] cevi123: you're nto rly strong enough to help there imo
[2:09:35] MewZilla: best thing to do at this point is just practice farming, game is pretty over xD
[2:09:43] Qutini: they didnt back when they should've, you did the right thing
[2:09:48] Joitch: Holy
[2:09:52] fraggleroctv: Senna is great on her own... ranged stun with heals is what u need
[2:10:00] MewZilla: not worth xD
[2:10:00] nerscyllathrilla: No Yuumi = No 2v5 the world
[2:10:01] bromanatee: well that was questionable
[2:10:04] Qutini: not worht
[2:10:08] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1447246690491187209
[2:10:10] Solfull: big shutdown

[2:10:35] bromanatee: LUL
[2:10:37] nerscyllathrilla: Zoning ult

[2:11:14] Nathanisms: unfortunately tanks are poo poo atm
[2:11:20] MewZilla: LUL
[2:11:23] Derilich: FeelsStrongMan

[2:11:27] RhodesToRome: POGSLIDE
[2:11:29] xenorifle: Int brothers are carrying, what a surprise LUL
[2:11:46] titanodin: yasou hit is 0/11 power spike?
[2:11:59] Runforyerlives: Yes that's the adc life. A bruiser casually walks onto your face and kills you, while you can do nothing about it.
[2:12:12] nerscyllathrilla: HAve tanks been good at any point recently? Last time I remember tanks being strong was season 4 or maybe 5? Can't remember exactly.
[2:12:16] imjustkp: ForegoneRain subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 79 months! we've fallen to league levels boys its not good indeed

[2:12:33] Jukettaja: Well you certainly can't tank as much this season
[2:12:38] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:12:41] Joitch: Whats the cs/m target based on?
[2:12:49] Nurama: @nerscyllathrilla pre season, but they are not bad right now... least IMO
[2:13:06] Deno5555: It'a crab not a turtle :O
[2:13:07] Merandil: Thats a SCUTTLER, thank you very much cohhRude
[2:13:09] nerscyllathrilla: They're still supporting, just not you
[2:13:10] JeXus1985: @Joitch it's based on aggregated numbers/stats from the different ranks in league
[2:13:13] DoggyP0O: he's pocketing the carries
[2:13:13] Derilich: @Joitch shows the medal up there too, i think it's showing gold rank ?
[2:13:13] Qutini: @nerscyllathrilla can't remember them ever being good at pro lvl, in casual games they were hit an miss when I played... wow like 5 years ago x)
[2:13:24] hirtza1: he should be on talon and sylas only at this point
[2:13:36] Joitch: Icic thanks
[2:13:38] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[2:13:39] Deno5555: LUL
[2:13:39] BlargMcBlarg: No supporting, time for reporting. LUL
[2:13:44] Runforyerlives: Kite with almost to no damage is still a death.
[2:13:46] Joitch: Ye that looked like bronze to me but i wasnt sure
[2:13:57] Joitch: Cuz it looks a little different
[2:14:08] nerscyllathrilla: Hunting for kills, not winning the game
[2:14:12] BroqRox: lol
[2:14:13] nerscyllathrilla: tsk tsk tsk
[2:14:13] Qutini: ^
[2:14:14] JeXus1985: this is why I dislike Yasuo in my games, instaban for me :D
[2:14:17] Ozoaken: KEKW
[2:14:24] hirtza1: @Runforyerlives he kills trundle there easily if he doesn't stand still lol
[2:14:28] MewZilla: LOL
[2:14:30] xenorifle: LUL
[2:14:34] JeXus1985: yeah I can see how that's a thing
[2:14:35] afreak10: KEKW
[2:14:36] Lindobu: KEKW
[2:14:40] MewZilla: pyke is hard to deal with if you don't know him xD
[2:14:40] mmgman: pyke is an instand ban for me
[2:14:41] Merandil: Oh yeah, Pyke. Ouch.
[2:14:41] Rennalt: i was gonna say, i've seen you ban yasuo so many times
[2:14:43] Joitch: i fucking hate pyke
[2:14:44] xenorifle: Reset city Pog
[2:14:46] Lindobu: wait till he meets a good shaco
[2:14:52] JeXus1985: it's unfortunate, there's at least 10 characters you ideally want to ban from your game :D
[2:14:52] Ozoaken: pyke isnt bad just dont get hooked
[2:14:53] Joitch: Hes so fucking annoying to play vs
[2:14:56] ErikThe_Viking: Pyke is LUL
[2:15:00] Nwid: ijpF1
[2:15:06] Runforyerlives: @JeXus1985 Good thing riot made Yone
[2:15:07] Derilich: i hate that he gets like 1/5th of his hp every swing
[2:15:10] Jukettaja: My go to ban is still Master Yi
[2:15:10] Qutini: @Lindobu so fcking true... still not ban worthy, bot holy shit
[2:15:15] KonikMiejski: only teemo or yuumi bans, no other champ pisses me off as much as them
[2:15:18] TaerTech: wait untill you face a good viego
[2:15:18] Qutini: but*
[2:15:26] Jukettaja: But it's less important nowadays since everyone has true damage anyway
[2:15:30] JeXus1985: @JeXus1985 to be fair, I think Yone is less of a nuisance than his shitbird brother
[2:15:33] nerscyllathrilla: I always banned Ez. Partially because of trauma from the times he has absolutely broken the game over his knee, and partial cause I got sick of seeing him EVER SINGLE GAME
[2:16:02] fraggleroctv: Yi Viego Kayn... danger is always from the jungle
[2:16:04] Joitch: Nice ult
[2:16:08] JeXus1985: yes, get that gold back from that fucker
[2:16:09] BroqRox: nice

[2:16:25] aseranori: that's a nice ult
[2:16:30] OnePunchMac: I don't get this game. At the moment I haven't a clue what is happening
[2:16:46] Qutini: @OnePunchMac ye its a hard game to get into
[2:16:55] Riluske: @OnePunchMac things are dying and people are winning
[2:17:05] Derilich: nice ult ye
[2:17:06] BlargMcBlarg: It's LoL, no-one understands what's happening LUL
[2:17:11] Ahristokatt: wait is that little thing attached to jp?
[2:17:23] Qutini: @Ahristokatt a champ

[2:18:04] Joitch: Thats game
[2:18:05] GingerMiike: Pog ult
[2:18:06] Bearsquatch: @OnePunchMac the goal of the game is to destroy the other teams base. your champion scales with exp from killing minions/players and you buy items with the gold you get from killing said things.
[2:18:12] bulletsponge55: no wind wall to save them that time
[2:18:14] xenorifle: all mid and end 3Head

[2:19:31] Ahristokatt: someone is salty^^
[2:19:31] JeXus1985: @JeXus1985 oh yeah, I know. Wasn't a criticism per se, you just see it so often in moba's, at some point inspiration has to come from somewhere right
[2:19:39] Qutini: then*
[2:19:47] identityuknwn: How goes the grind in the cesspool JP?
[2:19:49] fraaah: I love how even in low level games people can be this toxic

[2:19:58] Ozoaken: 14/4 = trash yasuo LUL
[2:20:01] the_real_beardcat: JP doesn't need a support
[2:20:07] DoggyP0O: true story
[2:20:12] JeXus1985: you cant imagine the toxicity in URF mode
[2:20:21] JeXus1985: it's literally a meme mode and people get so mad :D
[2:20:35] Qutini: @ninja2601 for staying cool, he got pwned and he didnt ragequit, thats a thumbs up for me
[2:20:37] Eplesh: i love watching this, thanks for streamin lol man @itmeJP
[2:20:41] hirtza1: cos urf is fkin annoying
[2:20:42] KingslayerSenpai: Somtimes being the least toxic and just enduring BS is certainly Com worthy
[2:20:46] hirtza1: its way more tilting than real league
[2:20:49] zerohour_88: gotta keep PMA
[2:20:51] Tahkai: JeXus1985 really? I've not seen much in the last few days of playing URF
[2:20:53] JeXus1985: haha, I love URF from time to time
[2:21:11] Firebaaallll: that commendation mightve just de-tilted the trist, was good
[2:21:11] DoggyP0O: @Qutini did he stay cool? Looked to me like he was just afk farming
[2:21:19] Derilich: i always honor people who go like 0/6 or more and then still play for the comeback
[2:21:22] JeXus1985: something about firing a Lux ult every 12 seconds makes me smile

[2:22:32] Nemesis210: We do a little trolling Kappa
[2:22:39] JeXus1985: you should try playing pyke sometime, it's fun
[2:22:45] JeXus1985: it's shit to play against, that's true
[2:22:48] Ligerpawz: Pyke is the most badly designed champ in the game.
[2:22:52] JeXus1985: swain support is epic
[2:22:55] LogicJonez: Swain is mainly a support @itmeJP
[2:22:55] Joitch: Ye
[2:22:57] Runforyerlives: He is great
[2:22:57] fatboy600kg: no more like mid

[2:27:14] hirtza1: sick buildup for them to go 0-6 in groups
[2:27:24] DoggyP0O: @Hese_1 hmm season 2 was a bit early for everyone going tp. I think it was like season 5ish where all lanes went tp
[2:27:32] Dassiz: @hirtza1 theyll at least beat DFM once, cmon LUL
[2:27:33] zerohour_88: @Hese_1 ah, that's true, wards limit means everyone needs to ward, back in S2 you can buy near infinite ward

[2:30:43] pa_TIENce: Who needs cs
[2:30:50] Qutini: Brand should be the farmer
[2:31:00] titanodin: i dunno about q giving extra gold but it does crit if it bounces off a killed minion
[2:31:19] Deathspate: @zymioi MF is one of those champs that are insanely OP but people don't notice it too much cuz it isn't as flashy or unique as some other common "200 years" champs like yone for example
[2:31:23] spideycsa: I am thinking of gangplank

[2:38:18] daumis1: Less pay to win in that case
[2:39:03] 8Subinfi: !backseat
[2:39:05] itmeBOT: JP might not read or respond to everything, but he is happy to get non-spoilery, respectful advice on games. Keep in mind, any backseating that is linked to the story of the game ( do X to get Y outcome) is prohibited. ijpLOVE
[2:39:16] Qutini: @Lazar3t Swain cast a none dmg spell that proc'd a passive which dmged brand enough to kill him. **I think**
[2:39:36] Joitch: LUL
[2:39:38] zucroh: does jp know that Q will crit if it kills the first target ?
[2:39:40] KonikMiejski: D button

[2:39:53] TheSl1p: Is disapprove of this game choice. That is all. Th ask for your time.
[2:39:54] 8Subinfi: @itmejp you have too much money on hand, freaqent backs on base is a good habbit
[2:39:55] Ozoaken: attack move might have got him as he cam out of his q
[2:39:56] Hese_1: what is insanity? master yi? and his Q?
[2:39:57] zerohour_88: did Yi ever get a rework?
[2:40:06] ontarokane: still same old yi
[2:40:08] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1447246690491187209
[2:40:13] DoggyP0O: @zerohour_88 yes he did, but nothing really changed
[2:40:14] Hese_1: nope @zerohour_88
[2:40:14] ontarokane: as in season 4/5
[2:40:18] zerohour_88: KEKW
[2:40:35] Hese_1: he is same as before maybe updated model
[2:40:44] DoggyP0O: they reworked all of yi's abilities... into basically the same abilities...
[2:40:44] ontarokane: yeah exactly
[2:40:48] sombraxyz: i'm glad that Yi didn't fully heal while being attack
[2:40:49] Archangel3003: Yup Yi's Q is super bullshit and needs to be removed. No character should be able to not even be in on the screen while being able to do insane damage.
[2:40:55] W_Tile: I'm impressed with this swain tbh
[2:41:04] Ozoaken: brand wasted his r
[2:41:12] DoggyP0O: @Archangel3003 lol that's his one redeeming quality

[2:41:32] KonikMiejski: from tab
[2:41:33] 8Subinfi: you dont
[2:41:35] Ozoaken: tab and the grey circle on the portrait
[2:41:37] hirtza1: tab and click the ult indicator bal
[2:41:57] Archangel3003: @doggyp0o That's all he needs and that self heal. Just Q a few low health people out of nowhere and you're set.
[2:42:05] br4nd0nh347: yeah I wish we could ping abilities..
[2:42:12] zerohour_88: its understandable since usually CDs in LoL is low
[2:42:22] zucroh: they are very low cd, would not help much
[2:42:23] 8Subinfi: Q and go invisible NotLikeThis
[2:42:25] delta_time: Does he have user names off or is this bots?
[2:42:33] identityuknwn: you can also ping summoner spells as well

[2:43:08] applebananacake: LUL
[2:43:14] br4nd0nh347: yeah but to tell a teammate they can go in, because they just used their windwall or something
[2:43:19] nakata545: sometimes even if you can win, it won't be fun so why should you suffer
[2:43:21] BullTerrorist: never thought i'd see this
[2:43:31] m3rcer: did do some shit
[2:43:42] sydneyspencer98: Yi is one of those champs which are a nightmare until you get to a certain level of play then he just disappears
[2:43:45] W_Tile: you could also tell gragas and brand practiced that bs
[2:43:46] GingerMiike: top got ate up

[2:46:12] identityuknwn: the gemstone beauty Pog

[2:46:27] DoggyP0O: ? you see genuine people and mute. this is why everyone thinks lol is toxic
[2:46:31] Archangel3003: @qutini You're over estimating the intelligence of the people you have on your team when you play solo LUL
[2:46:34] zucroh: @itmeJP don't use your ult if samira didn't already use her W = a circle around her
[2:46:39] zymioi: who are the top ban char in this game
[2:46:42] Z3r0Fear: I'm watching this stream and get a gifted sub to another one that I haven't even visited in awhile twitch being weird lol
[2:46:50] W_Tile: all that cc for samira to cash in
[2:46:51] fruit_of_doom: this one is a w btw
[2:46:51] 8Subinfi: I have my chat disabled so idc
[2:46:53] Qutini: @Archangel3003 that might be true, I never played solo x)

[2:47:33] Tenagra: wind wall like yasuo
[2:47:36] ZeroDjinn: just destroys projectiles
[2:47:37] hirtza1: circle windwall around her
[2:47:44] Yango__: yeah it just gets rid of your ult
[2:47:47] showstopperNL: I think top or mid would be perfect for JP.
[2:47:48] OnePunchMac: JP did you watch Foundation
[2:47:53] Yango__: anyone within or behind it
[2:48:07] zymioi: how is that show foundation ??
[2:48:08] Qutini: wait what, a Taric? is he buffed? x)
[2:48:22] DoggyP0O: does it cancel mf ult? I feel like it would just block a few shots
[2:48:27] OnePunchMac: I'm enjoying it
[2:48:45] Yango__: it cancels pretty much her whole r
[2:48:47] br4nd0nh347: it comes out every Friday at 12am
[2:48:50] frost21x3: about 1,5 seconds of deflecting all projectiles around her
[2:49:03] 8Subinfi: @qutini i dont think so, but a good taric with Samira can fuck shit up
[2:49:04] Darkaros: MmmHmm
[2:49:23] OnePunchMac: Hard to believe he wrote those books is the 40's
[2:49:24] fruit_of_doom: you got this
[2:49:26] Archangel3003: @Qutini Lucky for you then at least!
[2:49:28] br4nd0nh347: good CG and futuristic society, we'll see what happens
[2:49:33] fruit_of_doom: it's a w
[2:49:43] Qutini: @8Subinfi ah, I just remember him not being played close to ever when he got reworked :P
[2:49:50] zymioi: @itmeJP i made it out of stormblood few night ago :)
[2:50:07] Archangel3003: Chat did you know that gems are truly outrageous? Like truly, truly outrageous.
[2:50:17] W_Tile: is this a bad juju thresh
[2:50:22] Qutini: @Archangel3003 well I played some ranked solo.... lets just say I did not enjoy it x)
[2:50:25] Joitch: Yes
[2:50:27] zerohour_88: @Archangel3003 KEKW
[2:50:43] Yango__: does jp want advice or not? I don't wanna be annoying if he doesn't want it lol
[2:50:46] Joitch: Its like a short line that he can aim thats tethered to him and his link
[2:50:54] Deathspate: Is this lofi playlist still going? How long is it?
[2:51:01] Qutini: @Yango__ he won't read it, he told me earlier
[2:51:01] zerohour_88: @Yango__ you can mention it but he probably won't remember it LUL
[2:51:03] zucroh: i feel like jp would enjoy comet on mf more than pta
[2:51:08] fruit_of_doom: you got this
[2:51:09] Yango__: kk lol
[2:51:14] W_Tile: Yango__ is best to not spam it
[2:51:20] fruit_of_doom: not every game will be bad
[2:51:20] Yango__: oh I won't
[2:51:21] Qutini: ^
[2:51:24] zymioi: @Yango__ he will take advice but may not follow up on that advice per game
[2:51:41] Yango__: yeah fair enough
[2:51:52] altizar: your support is suppose to help you CS in that situation
[2:51:54] epicshoo: reactive advice is probably better
[2:52:07] Yango__: he just overleashed a lot and it can really mess with your lane if you do that
[2:52:08] zerohour_88: oooh, Thresh, I miss this champ
[2:52:18] Archangel3003: @Qutini That's why I've been avoiding ranked but kinda just want to give it a go lol
[2:52:33] UltimateSpy1: Hey JP your Q bounce does more damage if it KILLS a minnnion
[2:52:35] Qutini: @altizar not in this low lvl though, I'd have a hard time CSing without the support hitting stuff x)
[2:52:41] spideycsa: do they still have an ARAM mode?
[2:52:51] identityuknwn: yeee
[2:52:52] Darkaros: ya ARAM exists. JP doesn't like the idea of it
[2:52:53] Yango__: yeah aram is still a thing
[2:52:59] Yango__: they removed twisted tho
[2:53:08] spideycsa: ARAM is a good way to learn heroes abilities

[2:53:42] DoggyP0O: oh
[2:53:44] zucroh: if thresh walked at her that was free kill
[2:53:48] DoggyP0O: yeah nobody played that mode
[2:53:50] Darkaros: rip domino's
[2:53:53] fruit_of_doom: You're improving
[2:53:59] zerohour_88: who played twisted tho
[2:54:09] Yango__: I like twitsted D:
[2:54:11] DoggyP0O: twisted was fun
[2:54:11] stringz: kindred has good single target dmg
[2:54:13] Qutini: @Archangel3003 I have problem with getting angry at myself for not being as good as I want to be, and can't get past that feeling to actually play more games to improve. So I keep myself to singleplayer games nowadays
[2:54:41] jessyloxxx: chat, what elo is he?
[2:54:41] zymioi: @Qutini i have that same mindset u are not along in that thinking
[2:54:54] spideycsa: yar I haven't played since they had the rune system
[2:54:54] zucroh: nice one
[2:54:55] DoggyP0O: thresh looks like a silver smurfer for sure
[2:54:56] sombraxyz: nice
[2:54:59] Yango__: I think this is just normals lol
[2:54:59] Joitch: pog

[2:55:10] zerohour_88: still normals, not level 30 yet
[2:55:14] Joitch: Jp is only lvl 23
[2:55:17] zucroh: if he dodged the stun that would've been perfect
[2:55:22] stringz: click lantern for tresh to get shield or something :D
[2:55:39] jessyloxxx: !bf2024thoughts
[2:55:53] Qutini: @zymioi its a good mindset if you want to improve. I just can't handle it while having a depression thats gets dangerous when I get angry :/
[2:56:05] fruit_of_doom: You're doing great
[2:56:21] DoggyP0O: no just a line stun
[2:56:23] cornbraydd: just the line
[2:56:23] zucroh: only the line stuns
[2:56:24] ZeroDjinn: only line now
[2:56:24] Yango__: nah he just has the line stun
[2:56:24] hirtza1: no only line stun
[2:56:25] jebjealous: No just the line
[2:56:28] Qutini: only line
[2:56:28] zymioi: @Qutini yes so true
[2:56:29] adrianlibri: only line
[2:56:30] epicshoo: on-demand went to line cause it was OP
[2:56:35] hirtza1: they removed every point and click stun in the game except annie and TF
[2:56:40] zucroh: that was her w @itmeJP
[2:56:46] Saliqua: In the olden days it was a target stun. Was reworked
[2:56:59] identityuknwn: one thing i was noticing while watching TI is their steam plugins are sexy I wish riot had something like that
[2:57:03] epicshoo: fixed taric jungle right up with that rework KEKLEO
[2:57:16] Yango__: Taric jungle is still good
[2:57:18] stringz: they can tower dive u with lvl 6 from taric if they know how :D
[2:57:19] Archangel3003: @Qutini I just accept I'm not that good so then enjoy the times I pull off something good or the games I do really well :D
[2:57:35] titanodin: oh a samria
[2:57:37] zerohour_88: @identityuknwn you mean Stream plugins?
[2:57:38] stringz: LUL
[2:58:04] identityuknwn: @zerohour_88 yeah LOL
[2:58:10] stringz: Warwick is HUGE
[2:58:31] zymioi: @Qutini playing PVP some times triggers my stress eating so its hard for me to get in PVP some times
[2:58:33] Qutini: @Archangel3003 I can do that when I play with friends, cause then we can a have a fun banter. but not when I'm solo, I have tried though
[2:58:38] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[2:58:45] zerohour_88: @identityuknwn yeah, the one where you can hover over spells right? that was a plugin made by sunsfan team iirc
[2:58:46] jebjealous: Yes
[2:58:47] sombraxyz: yes
[2:58:52] W_Tile: yep
[2:58:55] Yango__: does he mean the minions? lol
[2:59:09] altizar: you get more dmg if you can time that bounce shot with killing the minion
[2:59:13] 4braxis: A thing is a foot
[2:59:18] Qutini: @zymioi ye its stressful, but it can be so much fun when everything goes your way too
[2:59:21] AcroXL: max 2 champignons
[2:59:33] stringz: ward the river bush
[2:59:47] stringz: :D
[2:59:56] zucroh: samira has combo score like DMC, when she get's at S she can use ultimate
[3:00:04] OnePunchMac: Flashy lights all over the place
[3:00:12] zymioi: @Qutini yes what i love about PVP some times i can not just do it 24 hrs day  just a few games max
[3:00:13] Archangel3003: @Qutini Well hope maybe you can one day in the future ijpLOVE
[3:00:55] cornbraydd: that was an accident, lol
[3:01:02] hirtza1: a very bad place for a herald is what it is
[3:01:06] Qutini: @Archangel3003 ty <3
[3:01:22] stringz: plate gold NotLikeThis
[3:01:24] murasaur: ooof, poor warwick, I know the feeling of messing that up

[3:01:41] identityuknwn: @zerohour_88 tbh you can hover over/click anything like the heroes at the top to see their skills and what agnims(however you spell it) pull up a thing to the left to see everyones items in the game see in the shop if you are a new player pretty cool
[3:01:43] DoggyP0O: nah, taric is just tanky
[3:01:52] W_Tile: warwick why?
[3:02:05] Qutini: @zymioi ye thats also whats keeps me of playing pvp, I just don't have the time nor stamina to play those game to get as good as I wanna be anymore
[3:02:31] zerohour_88: @identityuknwn yup, I think its the most downloaded/used Twitch plugin at one point? but the team made no money at all from it
[3:02:58] 4braxis: coxJam
[3:03:14] hirtza1: @Qutini it's nice to be able to recognize that, sometimes it's just not worth the struggle
[3:03:17] cherry_badger: coxJam
[3:03:22] 4braxis: PepeHands
[3:03:25] mimic5005: coxJam
[3:03:33] sombraxyz: that one didn't miss lol
[3:03:33] zucroh: just zoe things
[3:03:35] murasaur: damn, that was a hell of a gank
[3:03:44] zymioi: @Qutini why i am glad i can watch other people suffer instead of me lol why twitch is a good choice
[3:03:46] zerohour_88: Thresh throwing hooks willy-nilly rarely works
[3:03:46] Qutini: @hirtza1 ye
[3:03:59] Qutini: @zymioi haha so true
[3:04:15] droolingpenguin: was there no "missing" ping from mid?
[3:04:50] zerohour_88: roaming Thresh, definitely smells like a smurf LUL
[3:05:03] hirtza1: weakside gaming
[3:05:06] Qutini: good call
[3:05:07] adrianlibri: most supports know by now that they're supposed to roam
[3:05:28] hirtza1: no way this thresh is a smurf with gameplay like that lol
[3:05:30] Qutini: should you though at this low lvl? @adrianlibri
[3:05:33] zucroh: you roam at the right time tho,not when it destroys your lane
[3:05:36] DoggyP0O: he def a smurf
[3:05:39] sombraxyz: I think it may be time to wander a bit more rather than stay in lane
[3:05:41] adrianlibri: why not
[3:05:43] DoggyP0O: he just doesn't know how to play thresh
[3:05:45] adrianlibri: when are you gonna learn
[3:05:49] EvilGardener: Chat, what was the initial reason to start playing League by JP? Being curious and I wasn't at the beginning of origin of this idea
[3:05:52] sydneyspencer98: @adrianlibri Yeah but supports at this level do it badly
[3:06:02] Neragsito: bane commenting
[3:06:04] adrianlibri: so?
[3:06:07] Darkaros: !whylol
[3:06:07] itmeBOT: Did you know that JP's beloved, Aureylian, is Riot Games' Global Head of Player Community? JP now wants to learn League of Legends to connect with her and her co-workers ijpLOVE
[3:06:08] W_Tile: speed buff while in that wind aoe
[3:06:09] hirtza1: he has no clue how to lane in general
[3:06:11] adrianlibri: doesn't mean they can't try
[3:06:23] hirtza1: but guess he could be low elo and also 1st time thresh
[3:07:02] Runforyerlives: @hirtza1 this isn't even ranked
[3:07:22] jebjealous: His ult
[3:07:23] LegendsOfBobby: her ult
[3:07:24] Qutini: @hirtza1 he is not a support player, he got annoyed that he got the support role
[3:07:25] cornbraydd: kindred ult
[3:07:29] Aemon__: her ult makes anyone immune in it
[3:07:31] JeXus1985: they throw down a circle in which everyone becomes invulnerable
[3:07:33] zucroh: big circle = ult = can't die
[3:07:34] Joitch: Her ult makes it so no one can die
[3:07:35] cornbraydd: people stop taking damage when below a certain amount
[3:07:36] Infidel_Art: how's the grind going chat
[3:07:37] LegendsOfBobby: like tryndamere ult but aoe
[3:07:42] theschweet: theschweet subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months!

[3:07:42] Joitch: That includes your team btw
[3:07:43] Inathescem: it took a while but another SC guy falls to lol
[3:07:45] ZMightyCheeba: kindred ult
[3:07:49] sombraxyz: got away with it
[3:07:50] sydneyspencer98: Learning to roam is good, but when you're constantly losing your lane because your support is roam too much/at bad times it's understandable to get frustrated
[3:07:55] altizar: can't die in her ultimate
[3:07:57] zerohour_88: warwick doing ok at least
[3:07:59] stringz: fast recall cuz of herald buff
[3:08:08] hirtza1: @Qutini yeah but his gameplay in lane was... something different, can't be higher than bronze or silver
[3:08:09] LegendsOfBobby: lol his ult too
[3:08:13] stringz: taric wasted ult DatSheffy
[3:08:15] zucroh: yes,another immune ultimate
[3:08:16] johnfive21: Taric's ult is also invulnerability
[3:08:18] VTuberThighsChokeVictim: His ult too, yeah
[3:08:25] Qutini: @hirtza1 true true
[3:08:48] zucroh: when the beam comes down and they are shielded with that bright white shield,they are immune to damage
[3:08:54] DoggyP0O: his mechanics are pretty good

[3:09:13] thatskullguy: Taric and they’re adc is kinda a nutty combo
[3:09:16] Qutini: @hirtza1 aren't there alot of low lvl smurfs though? since then they get to feel better about themselves? :P
[3:09:25] sombraxyz: nice
[3:09:30] johnfive21: sweet 900g shutdown

[3:13:34] Ozoaken: team is just running in 1 at a time
[3:13:37] murasaur: warwick isnt exactly an initiator, feels like sometimes, but not if you start trying to kill a taric
[3:13:38] zucroh: unlucky liss wanted to surrender,game was winnable
[3:13:40] sombraxyz: that was a winnable game
[3:13:48] zerohour_88: Thresh couldn't initiate at all
[3:13:55] afreak10: u toke my role reeeee
[3:13:56] Infidel_Art: monkaHmm life

[3:14:31] FluentZap: It makes me question humanity a species
[3:14:38] GavinXI: was the thresh raging all game?
[3:14:41] bairdman: thats something ill never understand, autofill is a thing, learn the basics of all the roles and stick to an easy champ for it
[3:14:49] vincentvolaju24: just tell them to suck corndogs, it really pisses them off, at least from my experience
[3:14:50] peiman92: Ive had mane of these conversations after OW ranked games

[3:17:34] zucroh: @itmeJP would you be down to try out comet in runes for MF ?it's better at poking in lane, you just use E and do 100+ dmg
[3:17:47] TETLegion: oh thanks Darkaros xD
[3:17:50] bairdman: @identityuknwn not usually, adc isnt a sought after role as much
