[0:16:31] xarantur: Haven't you already kind of made your own build in a few other leagues ?

[0:17:50] Mujona: The Evasion Buffs are looking VERY nice in Path of Building atm

[0:18:03] epidus: you've played enough you'd beable bullshit together a build for mapping
[0:18:11] SZebra: @espi Ziz is looking at Mines or Toxic Rain.
[0:18:15] ApathyOwl: I find the passive tree heatmaps on poe ninja really helpful
[0:18:23] DaRandalizer: watch slipperjyms "as is tradition" video for inspiration...:)

[0:19:42] pa_TIENce: the new skill is just the light saber, throwing part is Spectral Throw
[0:19:53] Darkaros: @espi probably Flicker Strike
[0:20:14] Gorestep: Yeah I'm excited for this league, I've skipped the last two
[0:20:21] TyrealStratos: Every other league is good, the other half is testing
[0:20:25] Mujona: I am lookin' at Fire Trap Chieftain. Around 2mil DPS with only Kaom's Heart and bad rares.
[0:20:27] Kirino20: can you use lightsaber and cyclon? or how does that work

[0:20:41] WhiteMilk89: ijpHI hi jp and chat
[0:20:49] SZebra: @espi Definitely. I watched Preach due a FS build with his first unguided run, it was hilarious.
[0:20:56] epicshoo: pepeBASS flicker strike
[0:21:04] Renwar101: yea you can use energy blade and cyclone
[0:21:05] Xinder88: @itmejp I’ve never played TR or a traps build. Which would you recommend from a gameplay perspective?
[0:21:23] xarantur: you can use the lightsabers with spectral weapon. since it was in the official video
[0:21:25] Freezetrap: flicker is really fun but hits a wall around red maps, super expensive to scale also you'll probably never hit 100 or even high 90s cause you just die randomly a lot XD
[0:21:27] Renwar101: energy blade just replaces your weapon to a lightning based sword
[0:21:36] Darkaros: ijp5HEAD make a Flicker Strike build, everyone will be in Twitch chat avoiding the stream graphics and backseating, ez chat engagement

[0:22:16] JonnyFiveO: The tornado ability looked really cool, but I have a hard time believing it will be actually any good.
[0:22:29] Dom_Odyssey: i wonder if reaper will be better this league.
[0:22:29] Shin_gx: BIG BASS gachiBASS
[0:22:40] SZebra: Tornado might be a boss-killer I guess.
[0:22:56] espi: professor Ziz

[0:33:57] NoorElBahrain: ijpHI
[0:34:10] SpaceDive: I heard "dense" a lot.. its like a novel
[0:34:22] Hundisilm: It is probably more people who want the one time scoop so they are ok with being banned
[0:34:33] Darkaros: looking forward to dense = exposition-heavy YAPPP
[0:34:35] Hundisilm: Not that much invested in the particular thing
[0:35:13] leovic1: coxNotThatDrunk
[0:35:15] Mrshilka: @Darkaros Dark! ijpH
[0:35:23] Darkaros: Mrshilka ijpH

[0:35:35] Mrshilka: @Altair900 Alt! ijpH
[0:35:37] AnorienNightwish: shortening because of the character limit maybe?
[0:35:47] as_ter_blast_er: Zhoa is such a choice for director
[0:35:47] Hundisilm: "Solid story" is not a raving review I think
[0:35:51] Altair900: @Mrshilka ijpCOMFY hello!
[0:35:51] Hundisilm: for a moview
[0:35:58] SpaceDive: I bet most people won't like it LUL because its dense
[0:36:08] Mrshilka: now they keep buffing the power level of the mcu will we ever see a comic book level hulk?
[0:36:11] Zandivya: So this movie is about family eh?
[0:36:16] UGotToasted: Dense sounds like a code for boring
[0:36:20] SlipCrit: D:
[0:36:20] Hundisilm: omg
[0:36:20] ItsNoxid: ew
[0:36:20] SZebra: Ugh
[0:36:22] zerohour_88: ijpKEK
[0:36:23] raptorscream: ewww
[0:36:25] Ardranas: i wait for one more "dense" tweet to declare that they were all written by one person
[0:36:25] SlipCrit: wait unknown?
[0:36:26] Altair900: This movie is for the MCU nerds basically, right? like, its gonna be A LOT
[0:36:27] Darkaros: ijpONO
[0:36:27] teffy42: uhh
[0:36:29] Penguinizer: uuuuh
[0:36:31] Nogardknight: uh
[0:36:32] raptorscream: how can you compare something to JL and sound it like it's good
[0:36:34] SlipCrit: how is justice league unknown?
[0:36:35] tglenn: are they just two after credit scenes now??
[0:36:40] Mrshilka: hey JS JL is fantastic compared to the normal cut
[0:36:42] OCJeriko: guys, they said Snyder's JL, not Whedon's....
[0:36:46] xarantur: you don't relate a movie to a utter trash like zachs movie was
[0:36:47] geoffsgayestfan: uh marvel doesn't need a version of  jack snyder's JL
[0:36:51] Nogardknight: are we talking the Snyder cut or the theatrical cut?
[0:36:56] VintageZ: @mrshilka correct
[0:37:01] NayaVoras: ah yeah, Justice League and the unknown characters as Superman and Batman
[0:37:01] Altair900: Thats not surprising to me at all
[0:37:08] ItsNoxid: @OCJeriko both are ew
[0:37:12] xarantur: @Nogardknight the bad version
[0:37:19] Hundisilm: Who's Superman?
[0:37:19] ZeroHeat: From the trailers I've seen the visual style just really hasn't gripped me, hopefully I feel different after watching it
[0:37:19] SpaceDive: it covers 1000 years
[0:37:26] Darkaros: That review was referring to the Synder cut.
[0:37:29] MasqureMan: Whole lotta movie Kreygasm
[0:37:34] xarantur: gilgamesh ?
[0:37:39] xarantur: stripHmm
[0:37:40] WilliamKurokami: I can see myself not liking it that much. I prefer some explosive popcorn movie and not a mind-scrambling movie like 2001 and similar stuff
[0:37:43] Mrshilka: there is ONLY the Snyder cut
[0:37:43] johnnyt80: what's the run time
[0:37:48] SpaceDive: 7?
[0:37:50] Nogardknight: I've yet to see the Snyder cut, so I have no point of reference
[0:38:04] SlipCrit: Hmm
[0:38:10] leovic1: eternals must have really beautiful shots then. I remember Nomadland looking great too
[0:38:13] Hundisilm: Cloud Atlas wasn't that great - makes me a bit wary of stories taking place over centuries
[0:38:13] Mrshilka: @Nogardknight def worht the watch if you have an love for the Justice League as a comic group
[0:38:21] Jay_Knows: @SpaceDive 7000 yes
[0:38:22] NoorElBahrain: I will judge for myself
[0:38:23] SpaceDive: maybe a millions I guess if eternals

[0:39:08] Mrshilka: eternals is across the entire scope of mankind
[0:39:35] GoDoWaR: was about to say
[0:39:35] Nemm__: I am always instantly suspicious if someone calls it "A masterpiece"
[0:39:42] Nighthawke21: well, as reviewers like it chances are it's going to be bad
[0:39:43] zymioi: @SZebra LUL they all take notes from one page and its all buzzz words and they bet on those buzz words lol

[0:42:47] Truder2k: 3 billboards is a brilliant movie
[0:42:48] BigWaldo7713: @zymioi reviews are saying its a phenominal audio/visual experience so im torn

[0:56:06] Joitch: Tristana is very good
[0:56:06] craftycable: I like Lucian bot
[0:56:06] accionjackson88: one of the hard things in league is knowing what to do at a moment in time.  in laning you knowwhat you are doing for at least 10 minutes. in jungle you are confused from the first moment
[0:56:07] NPSJason: MF to solo carry needs really good usage of fog of war plays
[0:56:07] Xinder88: Ezreal has an escape
[0:56:10] flyingmangos2: Tristana is pretty good
[0:56:16] Killian_Kan: Well, you can play one of the 50 overloaded adcs
[0:56:16] AnthonyPafos: yes try tristana, she's pretty simple
[0:56:19] Jukettaja: Draven allows you to go for the kill
[0:56:20] flyingmangos2: MF is more meta right now though
[0:56:20] Hundisilm: 8 losing streak is not that impossible :)
[0:56:21] AinzN: Shoaron hypeE
[0:56:23] Joitch: Trist is also like that
[0:56:25] Baludor: Ez and Cait are alot safer, but they don't have the same pop off ability
[0:56:26] omgitsjason: @itmeJP im a kaisa main, try her she is really fun with lots of self-peel
[0:56:30] NiceGuyNick: Thats a ADC csrry for you haha
[0:56:31] BakaOniiChan_: but thats for every adc LUL

[0:56:42] NiceGuyNick: @itmeJP try vain yet? idk if shes still meta
[0:56:44] Lindobu: tristana is nutty aswell for solo
[0:56:47] Jukettaja: Haha.
[0:56:49] HahaHazer: Cait is for pussies
[0:56:49] Rodwolt: KEKW
[0:56:50] Gat0rCh0mp: Yeah Tristana might be the play.. then you get to be Elspeth

[0:56:59] AinzN: THanks for the info Shoaron. I only play Dota so all these League terms are new to me
[0:56:59] omgitsjason: Kaisa all the way baby
[0:57:06] Jukettaja: Did you say you liked Kogmaw?
[0:57:06] xarantur: the only good thing about Caitlyn is that she does so much damage
[0:57:09] GrateWhiteDope: Kaisa is hella fun
[0:57:11] Jukettaja: Or played Kogmaw before
[0:57:12] NPSJason: @Baludor Ez has some pop off ability, the other nice thing about Ez is he always makes his way into every meta NODDERS
[0:57:23] MerxAndCheese: I actually like Tristana a lot

[0:58:15] GrateWhiteDope: The new adc Ashkan is kinda fun

[2:23:45] Tartaroc: first time lux aybe
[2:23:47] DoctorJohn: no way you could be placed with a first timer
[2:23:48] Darkaros: shoulda hit 'em with the "same"
[2:23:48] SchnellBier: rip
[2:23:48] omgitsjason: shes trolling
[2:23:49] Devlind: maybe on that hero?
[2:23:51] DoctorJohn: oh maybe first time lux yeah
[2:23:51] NPSJason: Trist may take some learning but she's got basically no skill ceiling @itmeJP so if you stick with her she's a great main
[2:23:52] Qutini: someone who lets their friend play?
[2:23:55] Marc326: that means you have to be nice
[2:23:59] ZakuroPlays: Might mean first time Lux.
[2:24:03] geoffsgayestfan: first and last time player
[2:24:08] Marc326: friends don't let friends play MOBAs
[2:24:16] epicshoo: MYAAA
[2:24:16] VeloRama: that means you can bm her for being bad at last hitting Kappa
[2:24:18] HahaHazer: stripLUL
[2:24:23] woofser: MYAAA wtf
[2:24:27] omgitsjason: yuumi is so annoying
[2:24:28] Tiberious_Of_Elona_: DxCat
[2:24:29] breezly8: Yuumi being pick/ban at worlds is so toxic for solo queue.
[2:24:31] afreak10: MYAAA

[2:24:38] JohnyRallo: ignite
[2:24:40] VeloRama: uh oh
[2:24:40] Garrett_Redden: You were ignited
[2:24:42] Walshmobile: ignite reduces healing
[2:24:42] Qutini: you had ignite on u
[2:24:43] ZeroDjinn: ignite rduces heal
[2:24:45] VeloRama: LUL
[2:24:47] GrateWhiteDope: At least its not Jhin and Yuumi
[2:24:51] Razayken: ignite
[2:24:51] Duncain: ignite has heal reduction
[2:25:04] ragrath: Sam probably doesnt know either
[2:25:06] Garrett_Redden: If you see the symbol that is a gold heart with a line through it you have reduced healing on you
[2:25:09] HahaHazer: Idk if Sam knows that tbh
[2:25:10] GrateWhiteDope: lol
[2:25:10] Garrett_Redden: Grevious Wounds
[2:25:12] pa_TIENce: Sam probably doesn’t know
[2:25:14] Lindobu: your W resets if you fully charge a E, so if you apply E try to auto it until it explodes so you regain your W
[2:25:25] craftycable: sam only knows if lawlman or gmart told him
[2:25:26] GrateWhiteDope: ignite hard counters healing and rege
[2:25:28] woofser: This almost makes me want to play League again monkaS
[2:25:28] GrateWhiteDope: regen
[2:25:41] MostlyHype: she really do be the woat
[2:25:45] SqueezeAlicious: Facts
[2:25:46] NPSJason: Sam's like that one tutor who is only 2 lessons ahead of the person he's tutoring LUL
[2:26:05] jaypretorius: JP , Playing Yuumi is so relaxing
[2:26:06] Arcse0: Are you saying you don't like supports that can full heal people while also being invulnerable?
[2:26:06] SmoothNomad: ijpHI ijpHI
[2:26:13] GrateWhiteDope: Most supports are annoying, its like their job to be annoying LUL
[2:26:22] SaraScorpion: @jaypretorius if you want to be an awful yuumi fairKEK
[2:26:27] Darkaros: Jammies
[2:26:31] Walshmobile: yeah you push and backj so that it'll rebound back towards you in lol, as trist you won't be able to farm and freeze
[2:26:49] VeloRama: last hits are pretty good
[2:26:55] Bearyman: @itmeJP did you see there is a Marvel MOBA game, it's only for Mobile as far as I can tell though, but the characters look good
[2:27:04] omgitsjason: jsut save W to escape
[2:27:13] Darkaros: There's a Marvel MOBA now too ddHuh
[2:27:16] VeloRama: don't get greedy and push too far
[2:27:20] SaraScorpion: there was a DC moba on PC and it barely lasted a year after beta
[2:27:24] WhiteMilk89: LUL
[2:27:29] HahaHazer: Yeah you rarely wanna use Rocket Jump to engage
[2:27:30] ZakuroPlays: All chat died for this.
[2:27:31] Tiberious_Of_Elona_: LULW
[2:27:34] craftycable: sounds about right
[2:27:37] ApathyOwl: I had a much better time after disabling chat in this game YEP
[2:27:38] VeloRama: NotLikeThis
[2:27:44] Merandil: I see JP graduated from MF at some point?
[2:27:44] Darkaros: I saw "she does so much damage" above your cam so... ijpKEK
[2:27:50] Bearyman: it's called Marvel Super War
[2:27:52] Darkaros: this is his first try at Tristana
[2:28:00] VeloRama: sounds like you're team's feeding already LUL
[2:28:01] MostlyHype: Mr 200 Years LUL
[2:28:09] Merandil: Oh fair then @Darkaros !

[2:28:22] NiceGuyNick: oh nosss
[2:28:25] zymioi: lol today i had to clam chat down in all chat in ff14 wow vs ff14 fight
[2:28:27] pa_TIENce: 200 years is worse than Yuumi
[2:28:34] MostlyHype: aphelios literally takes a textbook to explain
[2:28:36] Groovyedge: ouch, aphelios and yumi, now that's an annoying matchup
[2:28:38] SqueezeAlicious: Let the cat do it
[2:29:07] Madracah: @itmeJP consider buying executioner early. its just 800 hold and reduces healing by 40%.
[2:29:31] MostlyHype: only reason i main support is because my duo partner was a adc
[2:29:32] SqueezeAlicious: Yes they either try to carry them self's or int
[2:29:51] Garrett_Redden: @WelpItsMelp That depends greatly on the ELO you play at...
[2:29:57] Tiberious_Of_Elona_: she has missed a lor
[2:29:57] pa_TIENce: You can get turret plates with your E
[2:30:00] Tiberious_Of_Elona_: a lot
[2:30:06] Mondo_Gibbs: which server is JP on?
[2:30:09] HahaHazer: I think it’s first time Lux, maybe

[2:30:56] zerohour_88: yes, the adc needs to CS, thanks lux
[2:30:56] GrateWhiteDope: Aphelios is quite annoying
[2:30:57] afreak10: first time btw
[2:31:02] Garrett_Redden: @WelpItsMelp Support or ADC? Cause hard disagree across the board for ADC. I play ADC and it's pretty much the easiest role in the game. It has some hard micro but it's macro is so easy
[2:31:02] GrateWhiteDope: @P4ste LUL
[2:31:04] Axelrod: Getting advice from a first time player in League of Legends. Sounds about right.

[2:32:36] Skyform: flash or jump
[2:32:38] ZakuroPlays: What doesn't make sense? He gets to do about four characters worth of stuff and you get to die. Easy.
[2:33:11] MostlyHype: good warmup :)
[2:33:15] bulletsponge55: I fucking hate that cat
[2:33:23] Welanh: warmup game with new champion & a support who is also new ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3 everything cool
[2:33:26] Senpai_Eeyore: I really dont understand this game and I have probably watched several hours of people playing it
[2:33:33] VeloRama: say byebye to your tower
[2:33:34] The_Faceless_Void: seems broken as fuck yumi can do that much dmg at such a low lvl
[2:33:41] Madracah: @itmeJP if you Hit your E when its on somebody it Incrases the Explosion Dmg
[2:33:52] VeloRama: oh wait, they ganking mid?
[2:34:09] Madracah: E the Tower
[2:34:20] ZakuroPlays: JP, you should read Aphellios's kit after this game to see if you wanna play him.
[2:34:31] Welanh: @ZakuroPlays :D
[2:34:35] HahaHazer: No one knows
[2:34:37] NPSJason: @ZakuroPlays so you want a novel reading stream?
[2:34:42] ZakuroPlays: yes
[2:34:51] JohnyRallo: hes never been fun to me'
[2:34:56] HahaHazer: Quantum Physics the champion
[2:35:02] Kersenka: He is great, i enjoy playing him
[2:35:06] nerscyllathrilla: Aphellios has weird ammo management stuff going on. Its strange, but strong
[2:35:09] Darkaros: can't be any worse than Ancient Apparition in Dota
[2:35:10] justmeepin: aph is the most fun imo
[2:35:14] pa_TIENce: Aphelios is stupid because you need to understand him to play against him, not only as him
[2:35:15] Garrett_Redden: Aphel has a bunch of weapons that all do different stuff with ammo counters. If you don't play against him often it's rough. Cause the second you think you know what he does he gets a different kit
[2:35:19] VeloRama: is there still a dragon in lower half of the game?
[2:35:22] epicshoo: Jebaited
[2:35:24] VeloRama: *map
[2:35:28] ragrath: Ye olde turn
[2:35:29] Tiberious_Of_Elona_: LOL
[2:35:35] Lindobu: with tristana when you use e on a champion you wanna maximize the amounts of auto attacks cause it will maximize damage aswell as giving you an escape by resetting the w, making you win most trades
[2:35:40] OuroborosChemist: so aphelios rotates his kit and abilities but howw doest go is it by skill use or time based?
[2:35:44] Rocyournoc: @VeloRama yeah
[2:35:55] MostlyHype: LUL
[2:35:56] Garrett_Redden: @OuroborosChemist It's ammo counter based
[2:35:57] Rocyournoc: LUL
[2:35:58] Merandil: @OuroborosChemist He has x amount of autoattacks before he changes weapons
[2:36:03] afreak10: KEKW

[2:36:05] HahaHazer: stripLUL
[2:36:07] ZakuroPlays: @OuroborosChemist it's based on ammo use. He autos to change guns after he's out of ammo for that gun.
[2:36:09] Banana25: YAPPP
[2:36:10] breezly8: @OuroborosChemist Each gun has 50 ammo, one aa = one ammo, one skill  = 10 ammo.
[2:36:10] VeloRama: i bet that one's already gone by now, i guess Rocyournoc
[2:36:13] Narnun: you will need anti Heal against yuumi

[2:38:44] vangardart: inting hard
[2:38:45] Lindobu: tbf tristana is severly different compared to mf in playstyle
[2:39:01] HahaHazer: JP isn’t lvl 30 yet & is not Ranked
[2:39:02] MostlyHype: trist is almost an assassin
[2:39:02] Madracah: almost at placements
[2:39:03] Xinder88: Don’t call it a comeback chat! COPIUM
[2:39:03] fraggleroctv: its tough to start League playing the adc role

[2:39:15] VeloRama: lets go full toxic and start surrender vote LUL
[2:39:20] epicshoo: pepeBASSHD
[2:39:23] Merandil: @OuroborosChemist Yes, vastly
[2:39:25] ceilss: And then they wonder why LoL community is so toxic... Probably cause some streamers promote intin live on the stream
[2:39:38] Lindobu: @OuroborosChemist there're differences between ADCs KEKW i mean jhin exists
[2:39:47] Merandil: @OuroborosChemist MF is closer to a caster in some regards, Tristana really isnt
[2:39:50] vangardart: Report Warwick
[2:39:54] vangardart: haha
[2:39:55] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: rooBobble
[2:40:01] ZakuroPlays: @VeloRama FFing isn't toxic, esp if it's such a big lead. Sometimes protecting your mental is worth more than trying.
[2:40:05] Scientist__: ijpKEK
[2:40:06] WhiteMilk89: ijpKEK

[2:40:13] Senpai_Eeyore: the only time this chat is serious is when PJ is here
[2:40:15] Darkaros: Also 0/4/1 at 18 minutes isn't inting ijpKEK
[2:40:17] ZeroDjinn: you can't say Engage without a bald cap or a trekkie uniform JP
[2:40:18] hollysephiroth: maybe he's german
[2:40:23] the_real_beardcat: Live has no place for jokes cohhLUL

[2:40:26] iamsepope: its SO fun that JP is playing league makes me happy
[2:40:29] NiceGuyNick: @Darkaros ijpKEK
[2:40:32] Narnun: remember to build some anti heal against yuumi
[2:40:32] Lindobu: @OuroborosChemist i understand that it usually boils down to farm, get items, carry but the way you carry changes
[2:40:39] Narnun: you will need it very soon
[2:40:39] ZakuroPlays: Also learning a new champ in unranked isn't inting. People say too much nonsense is inting when it isn't.
[2:40:47] Merandil: Mf has no movement skills though. She has movement speed that she gets out of combat but thats it
[2:41:21] Theagent203: what level is he now ? :)
[2:41:23] the_real_beardcat: I still always hear "Your turd has been destroyed"
[2:41:28] Darkaros: account level 29
[2:41:29] VeloRama: @ZakuroPlays dunno, i would wait until baron and if you have no chance to challenge, then surrender
[2:41:37] Theagent203: ty @Darkaros
[2:41:43] omgitsjason: why didnt she fight that
[2:41:45] Floshizzle123: Oh no! JP is going down the rabbit hole that is league, FeelsBadMan
[2:41:48] OuroborosChemist: Lindobu: well trist has dive dmg but less harass skills than etc aph, cait or jhin
[2:41:59] Kagutsuchiii: hit 3 times
[2:42:03] nategriffin_: shoot it it goes faster
[2:42:04] SchnellBier: rooSuffer
[2:42:06] nategriffin_: and does more dmg
[2:42:06] omgitsjason: no it does more dmg tho
[2:42:07] ZeroDjinn: you have to hit it for it to charge for more dmg, it expires on its own eventually
[2:42:09] Madracah: @itmeJP you can HIT it to Incrase its DMG
[2:42:13] omgitsjason: and it insta-explodes at max stacks
[2:42:13] MrJaycawbz: You have to autoattack it to make it do more damage when it explodes
[2:42:15] HahaHazer: Or shoot it to make it explode faster
[2:42:18] ZakuroPlays: @VeloRama It's unranked not at level 30, it probably isn't worth sticking that long.
[2:42:23] MrJaycawbz: And also cause it to explode faster.
[2:42:23] Lindobu: @OuroborosChemist that's where hail of blades and e comes into play, she's more burst oriented than poke oriented and the positioning changes
[2:42:25] ZeroDjinn: you can also jump onto the bomb to explode it on landing @itmeJP
[2:42:43] Woodyx89: but not on towers, just saying :P
[2:42:46] SqueezeAlicious: i say hummm iron 1
[2:43:00] Lindobu: that's actually no longer the mechanic jp
[2:43:05] VeloRama: oh boy
[2:43:07] ZeroDjinn: did they take that out?
[2:43:10] Floshizzle123: doesn't max e on a champ reset jump-cd as well?
[2:43:10] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:43:13] Lindobu: e is only strenghtened by autos
[2:43:23] ZeroDjinn: I didnt say strengthened.
[2:43:28] SqueezeAlicious: can we bet on what his placements going to be?
[2:43:28] OuroborosChemist: Lindobu: well poke works better than dive when co-ordination is less than optimal with teamates
[2:43:31] Theawesomesoccer2: OSFrog DAS ME
[2:43:33] Rodwolt: ijpREPORT bad info
[2:43:40] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[2:44:27] 14neo: Good luck on the placements ijpCHEER
[2:44:27] omgitsjason: tristana scales really heavy
[2:44:28] ZakuroPlays: Trist is THE scaling marksman.
[2:44:32] Lindobu: @ZeroDjinn in general w , now has a reset on kill/ assist or max e but it no longer deals extra damage on targets with an e
[2:44:32] nerscyllathrilla: Yes
[2:44:40] epicshoo: does trist's auto attack range scale with her level still?
[2:44:45] Narnun: Aphelios scales better than trist unfortunately
[2:44:49] Lindobu: @epicshoo yes
[2:44:50] Narnun: cause broken champion
[2:44:52] Theawesomesoccer2: ye epicshoo
[2:44:53] nerscyllathrilla: If you hit the bomb enough it explodes and does more damage
[2:45:07] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP The E gets build up when she auto-attack the target. Does massiv damage when it pops. Can also go on towers
[2:45:12] NPSJason: it's basically wildfire from mch in 14 @itmeJP
[2:45:15] vangardart: trist better duelist
[2:45:18] Theawesomesoccer2: if you hit max stacks on the bomb your jump also resets
[2:45:20] ZakuroPlays: You can use the practice tool to get a hang of her kit and autos
[2:45:22] ZeroDjinn: @Lindobu again, that's not what I said. I said the bomb explodes when you jump on it. Now, if I'm wrong on that then sure. But you're currently misrepresenting what I said?
[2:45:26] DoggyP0O: depends on the game
[2:45:30] vangardart: and split pusher
[2:45:33] MrJaycawbz: @itmeJP The passive with Trist's E: Does damage in an AoE after killing a unit  Active: Throw bomb. Autoattack bomb up to 4 times to make it explode for more damage
[2:45:49] SaraScorpion: yeah, thats not wrong
[2:45:52] fraggleroctv: trist has short range early levels. Caitlyn is a good starter for adc
[2:45:54] Lindobu: @ZeroDjinn yes i'm trying to both say, it doesn't explode on landing and also trying to explain what it actually does
[2:46:03] DoggyP0O: trist scales more in the dota 2 carry way where at one point you just run at people and kill everything
[2:46:04] VeloRama: hope your next matchup is better, this game is pure horror @itmeJP
[2:46:12] Rodwolt: KEKW
[2:46:12] Tartaroc: what is blitz?
[2:46:13] nerscyllathrilla: Cait is VERY boring

[2:46:31] SlipCrit: anneLol
[2:46:32] SaraScorpion: fairWut
[2:46:33] ZeroDjinn: right @Lindobu ok, just clarifying. When did they remove trist E>W burst? remember that being core as her kit during rework
[2:46:34] Tartaroc: ok thx
[2:46:36] OuroborosChemist: caitlyn is what the essence of playing adc is
[2:46:36] NPSJason: Cait is just Jhin for people who don't like fun LUL
[2:46:44] Theawesomesoccer2: have you tried jhin yet when i first started to adc i found him the easiest and fun
[2:46:53] Sonatta: Cait main here PepeHands
[2:46:59] SaraScorpion: i played both Caitlyn and Jhin for quite a while and prefer Caitlyn
[2:47:08] Lindobu: @ZeroDjinn i'm not sure of when it was changed but i know it's no longer the case currently

[2:47:12] TheyCallMeMrJJ: I see your bait, and I danHmm
[2:47:14] nerscyllathrilla: Jhin is the champ that first made me actually enjoy ADC. Best champ riot ever made
[2:47:16] ZakuroPlays: @Theawesomesoccer2 He's trying Trist because he wanted more mobility than MF had so I don't think Jihn quite fits the bill.
[2:47:16] NPSJason: @SaraScorpion next you'll tell me you duo a Morg weirdChamp
[2:47:25] fraggleroctv: a master at Caitlyn is terrifying to play against
[2:47:27] DoggyP0O: cait is like people who just want to play footsies in fighting games aka ky
[2:47:27] SaraScorpion: nah, rarely duo
[2:47:37] airsick__lowlander: @pa_TIENce Now that's the truth brotha

[2:47:56] epicshoo: COPIUM
[2:47:56] bulletsponge55: Spite

[2:48:12] MostlyHype: xayah>
[2:48:20] VeloRama: can the enemy get 50 kills? let's find out cohhNotes
[2:48:25] br4nd0nh347: do people okay Akshan as ADC?
[2:48:26] Kagutsuchiii: Tried varus?
[2:48:27] omgitsjason: Kaisa!!
[2:48:31] HahaHazer: EZ can be fun if you can land skill shots
[2:48:34] Barba06: I find most ADCs in League unfun honestly, except Jhin and Jinx maybe
[2:48:39] nerscyllathrilla: Ez is sooooo overplayed though. I'm sick of seeing him ever goddamn game
[2:48:46] zzNamttamzz: Jinx is cool
[2:48:49] vangardart: vayne
[2:48:52] craftycable: Lucian is my fav bot
[2:48:53] onkis: blue ez build was fun back in the day
[2:48:53] AinzN: ijpPRAY Trust!
[2:48:55] Starcloak44: hey chat is jp already doing placements?
[2:48:56] Sattigen: With the meta atm, just pick Lucian get 2 items and win the game
[2:49:03] W_Tile: Irelia I choose you! use the surrender button

[2:49:07] VeloRama: [x] doubt [ ] trust
[2:49:08] br4nd0nh347: wait Ez E has a cast time?
[2:49:13] Theawesomesoccer2: 2 ults worth
[2:49:15] Darkaros: Nope, we're still doing Unranked Draft. JP's account level 29.
[2:49:23] zerohour_88: yeah, if you get fished by the fizz at this point, you're probably dead
[2:49:25] Darkaros: This is the first match of the day, first Tristana try ever davesSuffer
[2:49:25] Narnun: OP Champions for the patch: MF, Aphelious, Lucian
[2:49:27] NiBl22: 0/10 powerspike
[2:49:30] ZeroDjinn: yeah ez E has a cast time, still lets you jump out of blitz hook though
[2:49:37] nerscyllathrilla: Yeah Ez blink has a (very short) cast time. You can use it to eat a bit of some cc effects
[2:49:40] ZeroDjinn: same for trist W if you time it
[2:49:45] Narnun: Aphelios is just broken
[2:49:45] Starcloak44: ah gotcha but almost there nice
[2:49:47] Narnun: also Yuumi
[2:49:54] NiBl22: thereis no kill like overkill
[2:49:58] HahaHazer: Yeah the E out of Hook has always bothered me
[2:50:02] Sattigen: He has both teamfight and burst at pretty much every point in the game, so all you need is to position right and you will win just about every fight
[2:50:02] VeloRama: KEKW
[2:50:04] Rodwolt: KEKW
[2:50:06] Narnun: and no one in their team has anti heal
[2:50:07] AinzN: ijpKEK

[2:50:19] ZakuroPlays: trust
[2:50:22] ZeroDjinn: its jsut a little farming JP you'll be FINE
[2:50:32] Rodwolt: 18 x 47
[2:50:33] ragrath: I believe
[2:50:56] ZakuroPlays: It's actually bad to take inhibitors because it just lets your opponent farm and get money.
[2:51:03] epicshoo: PepegaPls PepegaPls PepegaPls
[2:51:07] NiBl22: belive in 0/10 powerspike
[2:51:07] ZakuroPlays: / s
[2:51:10] Sattigen: @Narnun He is, they put too much into his kit to fix it with numbers changes, he has to have a kit change
[2:51:22] OuroborosChemist: well even if they get the carries garen and tahm are too strong
[2:51:23] ZeroDjinn: I miss old Irelia, much simpler to play
[2:51:23] VeloRama: this is sparta!!!!
[2:51:36] W_Tile: with the power of Irelia and friendship, maybe you can win
[2:51:40] Narnun: @Sattigen "out champions don't have overload kits"
[2:51:48] antiwirusas: I see league didnt change :D

[2:51:58] afreak10: KEKW

[2:52:19] Shoaron: yummi opop rn
[2:52:20] fluffycatpaww: rent a yuumi for yourself!
[2:52:21] OuroborosChemist: yea garen casually tanking whole team for 7seconds
[2:52:24] Narnun: Against Yuumi you have to build executioner
[2:52:29] reminkly: Yuumi is pick/ban atm so yea, that makes sense.
[2:52:34] DoggyP0O: I thought they nerfed aurabots guess not
[2:52:35] Narnun: by the time she hits lv.9 her 2 heals solo heal and adc
[2:52:36] craftycable: get Gmart in the game and he can Yuumi for you
[2:52:36] ZakuroPlays: Here's the strat. The other team feels SO BAD for winning this hard they'll FF before you do.
[2:52:39] Sattigen: @Narnun "We are going to give this champ 2 ablities but have 5 champs worth of kit" Seems like lies to me
[2:52:40] Xinder88: Lot of Yummi at Worlds
[2:52:42] pa_TIENce: Yummi is op and play a lot at worlds
[2:52:45] Tartaroc: these fuckers didnt finish?

[2:53:43] VeloRama: just a normal day at the office
[2:53:47] valkombar: Sounds like LoL tbh
[2:53:58] DoctorAsteroid: best strat for this game is ff and go next
[2:54:11] Narnun: CHAT! Has he been taught how to target only champions, Stop, Attack Move, etc?
[2:54:15] Kagutsuchiii: you move. gain 100 stack. hit hard.

[2:55:48] GrateWhiteDope: First game is usually bad
[2:55:51] MostlyHype: xayah is big fun
[2:55:58] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP The E gets build up when she auto-attack the target. Does massiv damage when it pops. Can also go on towers. Her Jump resets on kill aswell
[2:56:08] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: adc is A REALLY hard role.
[2:56:08] Duncain: land E, then Q/auto lots, enjoy damage
[2:56:09] ceilss: I suggest you take some coaching on LoL from some pro players. It will drastically improve your performance and experience
[2:56:12] DoggyP0O: auto reliant characters aren't going to be great for a while imo
[2:56:14] Duncain: W is best for kill securing or escape
[2:56:15] Rodwolt: good choice
[2:56:19] Lindobu: good ban Clap

[2:58:44] DoggyP0O: veigar support is very hot or cold in my experience
[2:58:44] omgitsjason: lane phase will be rough
[2:58:47] Theawesomesoccer2: nami the OG buble champ
[2:59:03] omgitsjason: just avoid the bubbles and youll be ifne
[2:59:19] SirRancealot: if this veigar is support then why will they have more kills than the carries? checkmate chat.

[2:59:57] DD_The_Shmey: I'm already Subbed
[2:59:59] Duncain: pretty much, but only jump to secure kill or save fior escape
[3:00:00] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Jump to engage or disengage - it will reset on kill
[3:00:02] CokedupChocobo: I usually save the jump for a get away
[3:00:02] HahaHazer: Jump only if it will confirm the kill otherwise save it for escape
[3:00:04] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: rooBobble
[3:00:05] craftycable: only use jump if it will kill
[3:00:06] LissXIV: AinzN I totally would! It's soo easy and fast. about 2 min runs

[3:00:20] Madracah: @itmeJP you need to attack the Target that has the E on it to incrase its Damage.

[3:03:34] Merandil: Time to fear the number 4
[3:03:36] Abssii: tristana is a lala
[3:03:40] fraggleroctv: played for 10yrs n i havent figured out bot lane.
[3:03:41] Theawesomesoccer2: long
[3:03:46] omgitsjason: like 90s
[3:03:48] cTrix: like minutes
[3:03:56] MostlyHype: basically wards
[3:03:56] Merandil: Couple of minutes? They don't deal much damage, they do slow you though
[3:04:33] nerscyllathrilla: They'll deal a shit load of damage late game, but that's not till really late
[3:04:33] SirRancealot: 3 minutes
[3:04:54] Kagutsuchiii: it did
[3:05:07] Madracah: @itmeJP if you dont Charge the E the damage is very low
[3:05:18] Madracah: TO Charge it attack the Target that has it.
[3:05:32] Walshmobile: would've been a wasted heal, was the right call
[3:05:40] Madracah: think its 3 attacks for max dmg
[3:05:46] Kagutsuchiii: his 4th shot hurts
[3:05:50] Theawesomesoccer2: thats like his thing
[3:05:51] nerscyllathrilla: He's only got four bullets
[3:05:52] Walshmobile: he has 4 auto attacks before he has to reload, 4th hit auto crits
[3:05:52] Gat0rCh0mp: his 4th shot crits
[3:05:56] omgitsjason: jhins a homicidal maniac
[3:05:59] Merandil: Because 4 is the magic number. The magic trick being "you die"
[3:06:09] AinzN: vVnce you think I know 7 more people to do that move? LUL
[3:06:13] Theawesomesoccer2: after the
[3:06:31] Theawesomesoccer2: 4th he has to reload aswell so in lane thats when you can try to fight him
[3:06:35] aethlinga: What come over on jp to play lol of all things?
[3:06:36] nerscyllathrilla: You're gonna push regardless. Trist just does that
[3:06:36] omgitsjason: its impossible not to push with trist, her passive does aoe dmg when you last hit
[3:06:42] mwgrolsch: +69 nice
[3:06:58] Darkaros: !whylol
[3:06:58] itmeBOT: Did you know that JP's beloved, Aureylian, is Riot Games' Global Head of Player Community? JP now wants to learn League of Legends to connect with her and her co-workers ijpLOVE
[3:07:04] epicshoo: what is with supports trying to last hit in the last few games?
[3:07:16] aethlinga: @omgitsjason That's her E passive but yes you gonna push
[3:07:29] Walshmobile: @epicshoo there's an item that makes it so them and their nearest ally get the gold from the minion
[3:07:34] Theawesomesoccer2: i mean atleast veigar has a reason with his passive
[3:07:42] The_Faceless_Void: @epicshoo if the supporst have blue swirls around them they have an items that allows them to kills minions but JP will get the gold and xp i think
[3:07:46] aethlinga: @Darkaros Thank you i get it now
[3:07:49] epicshoo: oh right i didn't see if veigar had the item
[3:07:50] nerscyllathrilla: I think he meant to pierce the minions and hit Jhin, but it hit both
[3:07:52] epicshoo: thanks chat
[3:07:59] LissXIV: @AinzN Oh trust me, PF is popping atm for this. Just join one on BLU. Or start one with you being the tank. It goes really fast
[3:08:18] HahaHazer: He might also be trying to hit minions to push lane faster
[3:08:29] phokinggawd: veigar is trying to stack his passive since he gets ap from minion last hits with his q @epicshoo

[3:20:18] nerscyllathrilla: Veigar Q also gives him AP for landing hits on champs with it. So he can get it from poking in lane as well
[3:20:19] DoggyP0O: Trist ult is usually not used for damage
[3:20:27] omgitsjason: some questionable W's going on here cmonBruh

[3:35:57] nerscyllathrilla: Ez with jungle items when they were first a thing
[3:35:59] Zaalri: tree is jungle
[3:36:04] aethlinga: Tp,Ignite
[3:36:05] Omakie: samirra nid
[3:36:06] nerscyllathrilla: Iceborn gauntlet
[3:36:07] aethlinga: Good luck
[3:36:10] galdamesh: @nerscyllathrilla i'm pretty sure top lane ruined klepto, cause people were taking klepto and the poke support item and getting more money then they could by farming
[3:36:12] nerscyllathrilla: Ez has ruined many things
[3:36:13] Seshaa: He is a jungler but people do weird shit
[3:36:14] Zaalri: wtf? ivern support that hasnt been a thing for years
[3:36:19] Omakie: ivern support is bad imo
[3:36:23] osakey: Looks like a troll
[3:36:31] ZanninAkkusu: His name lol
[3:36:33] sheek0: KARMA is dead since 2 seasons Sadge - karma main
[3:36:34] osakey: "Tree of Ignite"
[3:36:43] NPSJason: it's less that Ez ruins things, and more that most broken things find their way onto Ez because his kit is so adaptable
[3:36:45] epicshoo: pepeDD
[3:36:48] aethlinga: He has lethal tempo
[3:36:49] AinzN: BASS! OOOO
[3:36:52] Rocyournoc: LUL
[3:37:13] galdamesh: W first feels odd...

[3:37:30] Omakie: nvm
[3:37:32] aethlinga: @sheek0 Not for me i started serusly playing her after her rework
[3:37:35] Omakie: that was weird
[3:37:38] nerscyllathrilla: Ez has kit interactions that no one else does. Mostly his Q + cd refunds on hit. It makes some items, especially stuff with on-hit effects stupid on him
[3:37:41] ZanninAkkusu: It auto gets the trinket when you leave base
[3:37:46] zymioi: chat this is off topic question but what seems to be the build every one going to pick on path of exile???
[3:37:52] Amarou_: rooKek
[3:37:56] epicshoo: KEKLEO
[3:38:02] Omakie: what we asking?

[3:38:16] Jukettaja: What do you mean?
[3:38:18] Seshaa: ask them if they sit or stand when they wipe
[3:38:18] sheek0: @aethlinga she is so shit right now but ye
[3:38:25] Omakie: capital of Zimbabwe?
[3:38:28] DoggyP0O: whenever enemy jungler is afk, my jungler always loses
[3:38:33] TheyCallMeMrJJ: "Is pizza a sandwich" is always a good one lol
[3:38:37] ZakuroPlays: Kayne with the sick minion RP.
[3:38:50] epicshoo: probably gonna start with a summoner build. they're usually a safe starter until things get figured out
[3:38:51] Korkauflauf: We arent hot? D:
[3:38:53] Amarou_: Kayne can start doing raptors solo and should be fine adoreLurk
[3:38:54] Darkaros: We're not hot? Sadge

[3:39:00] aethlinga: @aethlinga idk she seems to be fine spot since her buffs not great but playable not like anyother time
[3:39:05] RobbedGamer: tturkDrama
[3:39:06] 14neo: he means to say Twitch chat is cool ijpEZ
[3:39:08] HahaHazer: Lukewarm at best
[3:39:17] Shoaron: he is calling us hot right?? Hmm
[3:39:25] zymioi: oh  i thought itmejp was doing mid lane did that game not happen
[3:39:34] aethlinga: dodged
[3:39:39] galdamesh: @zymioi someone queue dodged
[3:39:44] epicshoo: like 5 dodges
[3:39:45] sheek0: @aethlinga ever played he mid? nahh no more
[3:39:45] zymioi: ah okay
[3:40:10] caikeh: ivern's pretty bad lul
[3:40:16] Omakie: rivens are only ever gods or god awful
[3:40:19] Omakie: no inbetween
[3:40:41] aethlinga: @aethlinga Did but she is not good mid unless she got dmg buffs. Im a min support so usally talk fomr that point of view
[3:40:45] zymioi: i think i might do start slam build with poe
[3:40:53] Jukettaja: How’s Tristana coming along?
[3:40:53] caikeh: @Omakie guess which one plays unranked LUL
[3:41:29] Omakie: dont have to guess
[3:42:10] Zaalri: you liking her more than mf?
[3:42:13] sheek0: @aethlinga thats the thing she has no dmg anymore her q ult is not even a dangerous spell
[3:42:16] Aemon__: this might be a qss game
[3:42:28] afreak10: KEKW
[3:42:28] aethlinga: @aethlinga Yep true
[3:42:32] galdamesh: well at least it won't use your win buff
[3:42:41] epicshoo: so time to look into that other FF thing, the Final Fantasy thing.
[3:42:45] ZanninAkkusu: this is THE league experience right here
[3:42:46] Omakie: kayn could bring it back still
[3:42:48] NotYourLad: your team has decent scaling if they can find a way to stop the bleeding
[3:42:51] caikeh: but Riot says u have to play to win all the time! Kappa
[3:42:51] OuroborosChemist: so why akali is top and mord mid?
[3:42:57] NotYourLad: but the tilt seems to be started already
[3:43:05] Jormunduur: Started a timer, lets find out how close you are. Price is right rules
[3:43:10] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:43:20] Tokberran: Does JP Have some overlay on league or is it just me that hasnt played for forever?
[3:43:33] aethlinga: That lux was dead soon as she got hit with the spear
[3:43:34] galdamesh: @Tokberran blitz app overlay
[3:43:37] Jukettaja: At least you can have some personal goals regardless of game result. Like the amount of people last hits
[3:43:39] Tokberran: ah thanks
[3:43:47] Jukettaja: Or KDA
[3:44:04] Jukettaja: That’s what helped me enjoy games I had no control over
[3:44:37] nerscyllathrilla: Man, someone needs to get that Nid a tent
[3:44:48] raptorscream: playing Sniper?
[3:44:52] Zaalri: did this nid really stay in lane for that whole time?
[3:44:55] 14neo: good counter play ijpNODDERS
[3:44:56] lormike: Your teams first kill too!
[3:45:08] Darkaros: coxPog We're on the board, WINNABL
[3:45:19] Jukettaja: Yeah it’s fine. They wasted ignite too
[3:45:27] ZakuroPlays: trust
[3:45:28] aethlinga: @Zaalri She can this game seems pretty over but good luck
[3:45:30] Saryuken: nice game you have there
[3:45:31] caikeh: 1 RIP every 1.5min NJ
[3:45:39] Omakie: rivens always die
[3:45:45] geoffsgayestfan: what's the earliest you can surrender in league
[3:45:46] Omakie: unless there on the opposite team
[3:45:54] TK_the_Pirate: riven thinks she is Yasuo going for that 0-7 power spike
[3:45:57] Darkaros: PepeLaugh Remember how I said 0/5 18min wasn't inting it was just a bad game? 0/5 8 min is uh... borderline.
[3:46:05] Jukettaja: Mord is a hard champ to handle if they’re ahead
[3:46:09] DoggyP0O: i mean if morde didn't flash she woulda killed tbf
[3:46:09] ZakuroPlays: Ivern summons a golem
[3:46:13] ZakuroPlays: Samira spins to win
[3:46:26] Konvron_: @geoffsgayestfan 15, if you get everyone to say yes. 20 mins for 4 agreeing to surrender.
[3:46:33] Qutini: ^
[3:46:34] Zaalri: samira is a giant aoe and ivern summons a golem like annie
[3:46:44] lormike: GJ!
[3:46:45] caikeh: Winnable???
[3:46:51] Rodwolt: ijpEZ
[3:46:57] Duncain: good going though
[3:46:58] raptorscream: he shielded up
[3:46:58] Thikor123: Samira's is basically Reaper from OW correct? except she heals
[3:47:10] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1450496622236995586

[3:49:48] Darkaros: comeback starts here PepoChamp
[3:49:51] DoggyP0O: winnable
[3:49:53] Duncain: you got this
[3:49:53] Jukettaja: Does anyone know how to make the mobile app chat go over the video in wide screen theatre mode?
[3:49:54] montinyx: comeback time
[3:49:56] NotYourLad: honestly thought that kayn was just inting there but somehow that worked lmao
[3:49:56] Mcshoot: oh damn. We going to get a LoL PJ stream?
[3:49:57] zymioi: ijpHERO ijpHERO
[3:50:07] Faeyniix: @aethlinga dont all kayn [layers do that tho
[3:50:10] Omakie: kayn is a broken af champ if he can catch up
[3:50:13] ZakuroPlays: those do more damage the farther they fly
[3:50:14] Wolfplank: that spear is no joke
[3:50:16] Qutini: @Joebeezer love that LoL has commented xD
[3:50:23] ceLaguna: And YOU get a spear, AND YOU GET A SPEAR
[3:50:34] HiddenRoar: why are they all afk?
[3:50:48] Insigmada: I had to pop out, we win the one with fiddlestix in the jungle?
[3:50:50] Omakie: 36 cs riven
[3:50:51] Omakie: sick
[3:50:52] johnfive21: johnfive21 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[3:50:52] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing johnfive21! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:50:54] HiddenRoar: kayn and lux just stood there getting hit by spears
[3:50:56] nerscyllathrilla: Well, landing max range spears is normally difficult to do. However, when the enemy just stands still
[3:51:02] Joebeezer: lol yeah @Qutini except no more saying worth in all chat :(
[3:51:22] Qutini: @Joebeezer ?
[3:51:43] OuroborosChemist: nerscyllathrilla: yea you arent supposed to get speared unless being forced to move in certain direction for other reason
[3:51:44] Qutini: is that counted as toxic or what am I missing?
[3:52:00] HiddenRoar: all chat will be gone soon
[3:52:01] Joebeezer: typing / worth in all chat is a meme. riot is disabling all chat soon
[3:52:19] nerscyllathrilla: At least they aren't the nuclear-tipped spears of old
[3:52:27] nerscyllathrilla: Tower died before it hit
[3:52:27] Galoari: shielded
[3:52:30] aethlinga: Shieldbow prock
[3:52:31] Madracah: shield now
[3:52:31] osakey: Shield at it
[3:52:31] NotYourLad: shieldbow Sadge
[3:52:31] Faeyniix: she probs has immortal shieldbow
[3:52:31] Seshaa: shieldbow
[3:52:32] Madracah: bow
[3:52:33] HiddenRoar: the tower died before  it hit her
[3:52:39] Sattigen: Cringebow
[3:52:41] Lazres: melee creeps take two tower shots then an AA, range take 1, and need a little damage more than 1 aa (normally support aa + adc aa) or an aa and an attack reset kinda thing (cc'n under tower)
[3:52:53] Radcosh: good night JP and chat. enjoy the stream
[3:53:05] Madracah: @Lazres he is a Trist , his passive
[3:53:09] Qutini: @Joebeezer aaw.. I mean its good for ranked I think but for casual, it is sometimes fun to chat with other team
[3:53:11] Darkaros: night Radcosh ijpHI
[3:53:18] Jukettaja: At least they’re adding more anti shield items
[3:53:48] NotYourLad: typically for trist at a certain point you just have to spam max auto'd E into a wave and hope it gets everything under tower, she can be a bit awkward if the wave isn't set up right
[3:53:56] epicshoo: pushhh! hypeE
[3:54:27] Lazres: with the level of your e, it should be aa to kill the first range, aoe damage knocks the others into low enough hp to kill without a tower hit--you to aa the one the tower is targeting, your aa moves faster so you kill it, and it targets the next cs while your aa comes off cd for you to get it
[3:54:32] epicshoo: any trusters? modCheck
[3:54:59] Faeyniix: thats what kayns do
[3:55:02] Faeyniix: they flame
[3:55:03] aethlinga: Lol
[3:55:06] Kalishir: No way
[3:55:09] HiddenRoar: welcome to league
[3:55:13] Kalishir: That person has never been to school
[3:55:13] aethlinga: in a normal holy
[3:55:15] DonAsel: its a kayn
[3:55:17] DoggyP0O: he did have that top and mdi lane
[3:55:20] DonAsel: seems par for the course
[3:55:21] osakey: Blue Kayne flaming? Who'd expect that.
[3:55:28] RobbedGamer: Kayne and Draven players always flame
[3:55:30] OnePunchMac: more like kindergarden JP
[3:55:30] Walshmobile: @osakey LUL
[3:55:38] epicshoo: YAPPP so about AA'ing
[3:55:44] Faeyniix: kayns be like: i used R W and Q and they didn't die it's my team's fault and not mine
[3:55:47] Null_Value: @itmeJP Legit piece of advice is to try to keep ward coverage up as best you can in your jungle when behind to let you push out safely.
[3:56:03] OuroborosChemist: doesn't being bad or making mistakes not invalidate you as a human thats kinda how things go
[3:56:12] NotYourLad: btw if you get quicksilver sash against morde you can cleanse out of his ult if he chooses you @itmeJP
[3:56:19] montinyx: league logic @OuroborosChemist Kappa
[3:56:20] jmj1987: Are ya winning son?
[3:56:42] Galoari: well it's not just league , that's a twitter thing as well these days
[3:56:46] OuroborosChemist: montinyx:  applies to life too
[3:56:47] Scientist__: ijpKEK

[3:57:14] Zaalri: Clap
[3:57:17] Qutini: @jmj1987 I'd say JP is doing as good as he can in this game. rest of his team... not so much x)
[3:57:17] Galoari: aww i wanted to see how this would play out :p
[3:57:17] xunsim: true league excperience
[3:57:21] MikeTsa7: Clap
[3:57:23] Jormunduur: you were close on that 10 minute timer, was about 15 mins
[3:57:25] Darkaros: lost successfully peepoClap
[3:57:28] montinyx: Clap
[3:57:35] osakey: That true 40/20/20 rule.
[3:57:38] Darkaros: your Trist is improving quickly!
[3:57:43] Qutini: ^
[3:57:45] omgitsjason: thats deep bro
[3:58:00] jmj1987: @Qutini Sounds like LOL LUL

[4:02:28] Qutini: btw, whats with chat not having bought JP a skin to Tristana yet? :O ;P
[4:02:31] Lazres: teemo is kinda op bot--blind is an auto win vs most adc's due to auto attack base. And you can deal AP damage, so great if your mid and top are melee

[4:15:41] DezartIII: She IS facing a pirate. They knew how to fish
[4:15:43] itsMakes: @itmeJP Do you have an "Attack Move' binding setup yet? This lets you walk & auto as ADC instead of just clicking on the target repeatedly
[4:16:05] Iittlefrog: yeah setting that up is clutch, mine is bound to A
[4:16:20] Joebeezer: q costs no mana
[4:16:38] RobbedGamer: Doran's help with CSing if I remember right
[4:16:39] Xinder88: This nami is not 6 yet. Yikes
[4:16:40] Darkaros: I think JP has attack move; ex dota player etc
[4:16:51] Jukettaja: Shift right click is already attack move by default
[4:16:58] Joebeezer: Oh that reminds me jp, there's a setting to that shows mana costs on abilities. Highly recommend it

[4:18:47] Jukettaja: Well she’s trying
[4:19:00] Jukettaja: I would consider feeding more deliberate

[4:21:04] Zaalri: this silas is great, he got that early lead and he knows how to take advantage of it

[4:33:18] GrateWhiteDope: His arrow is an execute now
[4:33:19] Jukettaja: Learn the game? No idea

[4:33:28] WellBrained: @Madinero Years
[4:33:36] Jukettaja: Reaching 30 could take a week

[4:53:16] HappyMask91: it's on yas tahm or lee to engage you should fight front to back and go for an assassination if it presents itself
[4:53:42] ShadowsparksTV: You have jump and knock back. So you want to stay behind your beefy boys and poke as hard as you can. You hurt, and some hits can shift the fight quickly.

[5:59:45] raptorscream: i saw that after i pressed enter :P but such a weird UI dsesign
[5:59:55] Eyeofthehawks: Just because its not the same as Dota doesnt make it weird

[6:02:27] MrFireflybrahh: what did you say @Eyeofthehawks
[6:02:29] DemonSamurai: yikes
[6:02:29] Boonia: He farms his Q and just kills people
[6:02:38] Gat0rCh0mp: click on nasus and see how many stacks he has.. he seems fed
[6:02:39] Baiin: Nasus is basically a semi truck
[6:02:39] Nogardknight: nasus scales infinitely
[6:02:46] Eyeofthehawks: Hes gunna 1shot your no-tank team
[6:02:50] Runforyerlives: he kills in one or two hits after the q is farmed
[6:02:52] epicshoo: trist probably did fuck all against the doggo
[6:02:55] experiencepoints: Nasus's Q builds in power the more he kills with it, he's a late game nightmare
[6:02:56] Nogardknight: and he's going to 100% ruin your day as ADC
[6:03:15] HappyMask91: Everytime he kills something with q it gets stronger. his w applies a really strong slow and R is an "Oh shit" button that also lowers his Q cooldown
[6:03:29] Runforyerlives: The longer the game goes, stronger he gets.
[6:03:30] FiraVII: ijpONO Fed Nasus is just gunna run down mid
