[1:57:08] raptorscream: less cheaters
[1:57:12] KelticNight: basically, if people didn't moan about certain things, the game was gonna launch like the Beta LUL
[1:57:12] ilightup: Great idea
[1:57:16] DMGcontroll: Yeah it just seems stupid broken
[1:57:22] Irendin: if we weren't meant to est babies, why do shops sell baby food?
[1:57:22] raptorscream: @itmeJP you hack enviromental stuff, you dont hack players
[1:57:26] jeffhunter12: less cheaters but more people feeling like the enemy is hacking
[1:57:28] jeffhunter12: so really its a loss
[1:57:29] m3rcer: but then they install wall hacks to have it all the time and its harder to tell if theyre hacking
[1:57:30] Hyluhnduh: peepoWine
[1:57:42] afreak10: its supposed to be future tho
[1:57:52] Z3r0Fear: It will turn away some players that's for sure.
[1:57:59] afreak10: monkaEyes
[1:58:02] ilightup: Its future heartbeat sensor
[1:58:03] Hyluhnduh: BF 2142 had it. just as a commander ability
[1:58:06] Costanza33: when defending I already used to deploy the turret for it to spot peeps for me, so that grenade is gonna be mental
[1:58:10] 14neo: oh noes PepeLaugh
[1:58:12] ERNST54: why
[1:58:13] timeitsself: oh cool the thing no one asked for
[1:58:16] paradigmshitf: ijpNODDERS
[1:58:17] KelticNight: people wanted more tanks. they asked nicely
[1:58:19] Gat0rCh0mp: They learned... more tanks?
[1:58:19] Mrshilka: more Armour good NODDERS
[1:58:22] DMGcontroll: WHY!? We dont need more tanks
[1:58:22] StenSaxWTF: Tanks dice LUL

[1:58:41] WhiteMilk89: NOPERS
[1:58:41] Gat0rCh0mp: More things to go blow up with death drones I guess
[1:58:43] Sven_Stryker: ask Gassy about Helicopters though
[1:58:43] Costanza33: helis were such a chore
[1:58:44] Zucate: more tanks means more death from above c4 though
[1:58:46] HeartlessM: actually, tanks blow
[1:58:48] eckoman: At least they didn't increase the number of Helicopters...
[1:58:48] Hyluhnduh: need that 6 person apc that u can drive around and everyone shoot out of
[1:58:53] TommYB0y: but you'll be able to destroy more tanks JP
[1:58:53] Z3r0Fear: As long as I don't see more Helicopters and jets
[1:58:56] StenSaxWTF: T(h)anks a lot
[1:58:57] KelticNight: so the game was going to launch without a grenade indicator? LUL
[1:58:57] Shoaron: planes have to many flares

Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[1:59:20] Ribbons_Almark: wait there was no nearby grenade indicator at all during the beta?

[2:01:12] WhiteMilk89: looks like a plane
[2:01:17] KelticNight: that floating thing is the roof of the skyscarper
[2:01:20] ItsNoxid: Its the car door left open song
[2:01:21] omgitsjason: its a heat map
[2:01:22] Raging_PG: I think one is air combat and the other land combat
[2:01:23] tmn8: @itmeJP its a heat map
[2:01:23] PinkySteveNarf: WoW you guys missed agreat Ad coxPog
[2:01:27] DMGcontroll: Thats the tower?
[2:01:29] Kultak: idk wtf I'm looking at
[2:01:29] omgitsjason: yeah
[2:01:29] Scientist__: ijpWTF
[2:01:34] Chantan: think thats the FOV from the players on top

[2:01:41] Zwets_: Its the building
[2:01:48] DMGcontroll: Looks like it
[2:01:49] leovic1: looks like a scene from Tron
[2:01:52] WhiteMilk89: i guess concentration of player movement from the tower?
[2:01:52] Themmo: why's the overhead map upside down?
[2:01:57] Shoaron: is that E building?
[2:02:01] omgitsjason: that looks like a mri of the female reproductive tract
[2:02:01] Grimsley_: that's what i'd assume
[2:02:01] TacoTangler: its aliens monkaW
[2:02:01] DMGcontroll: 2nd image is neat
[2:02:10] KelticNight: tower was a horrible spawn point LUL
[2:02:22] Z3r0Fear: The Forest fights were great
[2:02:22] Mrshilka: well no armour inthe firest
[2:02:23] Costanza33: I liked the north part
[2:02:25] raptorscream: F and A wew not that big points of interest
[2:02:29] Schleicher65: people like clustefucks
[2:02:31] Mrshilka: plenty of inf vs inf though
[2:02:38] Foogalicious: well it makes sense because thats where the points were... no point playing off them too much
[2:02:46] Tripc897: I never once went to objective F, in the 20 hours I played
[2:02:53] Z3r0Fear: this game ran really well on my pc
[2:02:58] Tripc897: or E,whatever the one was closest to the US
[2:03:06] Z3r0Fear: 1070 still able to run it on high settings with i7 8700
[2:03:06] skygtr350: MrDestructoid ?
[2:03:42] IDominusI: I hated the bots so much
[2:03:43] Costanza33: UI was trash
[2:03:49] KelticNight: UI was actual dog shit
[2:03:54] IDominusI: And the map was bad
[2:04:07] KelticNight: so pressing M now does something
[2:04:11] raptorscream: They said day 1 it was disabbled
[2:04:34] countmarcula: d
[2:04:42] raptorscream: Wheel CHat COmmands
[2:04:51] Hyluhnduh: Nice
[2:04:52] Crosseye_Jack: @raptorscream Yeah just expecting players to read patch notes is like asking twitch chat to read stream titles. aint gonna happen :-P
[2:04:52] raptorscream: that's their name for it
[2:04:57] Crosseye_Jack: but*
[2:04:58] KelticNight: "Need Healing!" *tumbleweed rolls by*
[2:05:01] countmarcula: did they say anything about making the teams actually look different and not just be identical operators?
[2:05:11] raptorscream: @Crosseye_Jack those interested do, or watch JackFrags :"))
[2:05:20] Sir_Myrmidon: ping worked at all in beta?
[2:05:20] Shapelessdnb: It wasn't working at all LUL
[2:05:35] KelticNight: the bar at the top in no longer a bright colour

[2:05:42] raptorscream: no, it shows kill list on the left, more info in the center, bar at thetop changed
[2:05:51] Crosseye_Jack: @raptorscream just taking the piss out of chat and that we needed to create !title
[2:05:56] Buster_H: @Crosseye_Jack imagine getting 1 dollar for each time some says "oh now it works"
[2:05:56] Raging_PG: oh hell yes they moved the points eared the the middle of the screen. I was so annoyed they were off to the side lol
[2:05:57] Lefthy: oh nice
[2:05:57] raptorscream: oh yeah, i get that
[2:06:11] raptorscream: world wide kill feed
[2:06:17] personno4: did they get rid of the stupid music when u were close to losing
[2:06:18] Crosseye_Jack: @Buster_Hewley I would be rich....
[2:06:20] Costanza33: @countmarcula they said Specialists are here to say so it probably will stay the way they are now, so no they'll look the same unfortunately
[2:06:32] kosarkislev: I don't recall the color on the left killfeed either
[2:06:38] pc2400: Revive animation downgraded tho..
[2:06:41] Buster_H: cohhLUL cohhLUL
[2:06:47] raptorscream: @kosarkislev it was white and on the right
[2:06:59] countmarcula: @countmarcula like, at least give them different colored uniforms for their teams
[2:07:26] raptorscream: @Stalker2400 it's the same, the Specialist one, was shown becasue he has the perk to revive faster
[2:07:30] KelticNight: they'll sell skins to make the enemy look different, you know it
[2:07:44] pc2400: @raptorscream downgraded from bf5
[2:07:45] XeiZ: i didnt feel like the medkit was that useful in the beta tbh the auto regen was way too fast/strong for it to matter
[2:07:46] Siggenlh: still wont be able to tell who is the medic
[2:07:50] raptorscream: @countmarcula enemies will have filters on them to be easy to destinguish
[2:08:12] raptorscream: @itmeJP you choose waht to have in the PLUS menu
[2:08:13] Shoaron: nice
[2:08:17] Buster_H: the pre set builds
[2:08:18] Buster_H: nice
[2:08:19] Hyluhnduh: Nice
[2:08:24] Sir_Myrmidon: oh that is slick
[2:08:27] kosarkislev: good thats what I figured, they are simply "favorites" then
[2:08:30] Siggenlh: still want a preset and not hotkey
[2:08:43] TacoTangler: T-connection pipe scope Pog
[2:08:45] Buster_H: and still able to change on the fly
[2:08:46] SlipCrit: is that a change or just somethign we didnt see yet?
[2:09:05] Buster_H: @SlipKrit96 something not able in the open beta
[2:09:14] Slittyfungus: siege
[2:09:15] Altair900: NODDERS
[2:09:17] Slittyfungus: i hate it
[2:09:18] Siggenlh: only 4 of them gonna be used though
[2:09:19] Altair900: Apex and Siege NODDERS
[2:09:19] afreak10: EA marketing
[2:09:23] Siggenlh: it sucks
[2:09:26] pc2400: Hazard Zone is for Specialists from design
[2:09:27] ThaSandus: Meh don't like it
[2:09:35] Siggenlh: bring bad classes
[2:09:36] Slittyfungus: i want uniforms
[2:09:47] Madracah: As long as they dont Nerft the C4 Drone i am Happy
[2:10:02] TacoTangler: easier to be hyped for a new class rather than a new gun i guess
[2:10:06] Kultak: marketing sells games, not the game sometimes.
[2:10:07] pc2400: @Slittyfungus its fine you guys exaggerate about that
[2:10:21] Altair900: @Stalker2400 KEKW
[2:10:31] Slittyfungus: @Stalker2400 okay bud
[2:10:32] SlipCrit: well and racists like the other battlefields
[2:10:33] 14neo: yeah, no one monkaW
[2:10:46] BigWaldo7713: so you get to see who was in a plane or tank all game
[2:10:50] Altair900: It shows the entire team and best squad yeah
[2:10:55] raptorscream: entire team
[2:10:56] Siggenlh: no. not the stupid emotes
[2:10:58] Altair900: shows to the entire team*
[2:10:58] Buster_H: entire team
[2:10:58] raptorscream: best squad in team
[2:11:12] KelticNight: still no total leaderboard
[2:11:15] 14neo: what about the full score card though? is that not shown at the end of the game?
[2:11:16] SlipCrit: WTFF
[2:11:20] raptorscream: @itmeJP no, in 18h the first game bonus resets
[2:11:23] KelticNight: NOPERS
[2:11:24] Zivs: that's how long until first game of the day
[2:11:30] Darkaros: These characters have strong YAPPP energy
[2:11:37] Altair900: @14neo They mostly did away with that after BF1 and BF5
[2:11:47] Costanza33: we need a goddamn simple scoreboard, ffs
[2:11:50] bakavic: does anyone have the link to this bf info?
[2:11:51] Altair900: Unless Im mistaking something else as what youre talking about
[2:12:17] KelticNight: they legit want to drop the total leaderboard
[2:12:23] BigWaldo7713: nopers
[2:12:31] 14neo: @Altair900 i haven't played BF1 and BF5 so you might be right. I meant the score card which shows all the individual player kills and assists
[2:12:41] WilliamKurokami: less toxicity
[2:12:43] Siggenlh: they dont wan the K/D focus.
[2:12:44] MrDigitalCypher: when was the last time that happened?
[2:12:45] Scientist__: ijpKEK
[2:12:46] CDubTheRIPper: LUL
[2:12:47] KelticNight: actual shots fired Pog
[2:12:47] WhiteMilk89: ijpKEK
[2:12:47] the043: LUL
[2:12:48] ArthurNudge: zekeSUH

[2:12:57] Flashx2: KEKW
[2:12:59] BigWaldo7713: they dont want to see the guy going 8-0 in a chopper
[2:13:01] omgitsjason: cohhOld
[2:13:03] BigWaldo7713: 80*
[2:13:03] pc2400: well its 128 players if you are last you wouldn't want to see that right?
[2:13:10] ThaSandus: as if that would actually happen LUL Kappa
[2:13:14] Costanza33: I watch Ravic all the time play BF1 and 5 and he often showed the scoreboard at the end of his rounds
[2:13:19] KARISMA: gassy just be screamin get to da choppaaa
[2:13:21] TacoTangler: its a little lame that a competitive game doesnt allow for comparisons but i get that people get really bad about it
[2:13:30] zynessa: If we don't get to see K/D, we can't tell when something is OP, so they don't have to waste money balancing the game 4Head
[2:13:34] raptorscream: i think full leaderboard for 128 would be hard to implement and look "right" too
[2:13:35] Siggenlh: do they cost more than the console soon KEKW
[2:13:55] BigWaldo7713: so tiny D:
[2:14:00] KelticNight: memory cards are back. it's the 90's again!
[2:14:06] skygtr350: at least the PS5 isn't proprietary crap
[2:14:08] raptorscream: NVMe SSDs
[2:14:09] Hemry64_: Brooo thats so nice
[2:14:09] ritchie313: so a memory card from ps2 rofl
[2:14:09] Totenkruz: Poop Emoji
[2:14:14] pc2400: PS5 is a hurdle
[2:14:22] yse14: using a scredriver is too hard for me
[2:14:24] zynessa: @raptorscream That's 100% nonsense. Implementation of the UI is trivial compared to everything else that game does with player count.
[2:14:27] SquamusEpith: it the User experience, some folks do not want to open up their PS5s
[2:14:43] 00_Exia94: you gonna play it?
[2:14:52] WhiteMilk89: cohhBongos
[2:14:54] BigWaldo7713: what game?
[2:14:56] personno4: ouch
[2:14:58] Xani__: that's okay
[2:15:01] Vipro24: theres a scoreboard for your team, but not for the enemies team. You can only see the full list of players without the scores. (atleast in the beta)
[2:15:01] zerohour_88: that's seems decent enough
[2:15:02] pc2400: check previous games for comparison
[2:15:02] SlipCrit: eh
[2:15:03] afreak10: so so
[2:15:03] 00_Exia94: not really i don't think
[2:15:04] TruAxeTV: seems about right
[2:15:05] Norrak1: Nah, all weaker than Until Dawn
[2:15:05] TruAxeTV: not really
[2:15:11] yse14: not except Until Dawn
[2:15:15] afreak10: they are pretty Avg
[2:15:15] farvacola: pretty niche kind of game
[2:15:18] BigWaldo7713: i mean they spoiled the whole thing with the trailer
[2:15:19] zerohour_88: Until Dawn was pretty damn good, but the rest is eh
[2:15:25] JaseLeland: until dawn had a much higher budget
[2:15:25] SlipCrit: MrDestructoid
[2:15:29] Xani__: KEKW
[2:15:32] ReginaldXIV: Adam Warlock is in Man of Medan
[2:15:38] ReginaldXIV: Or was it the second one?
[2:15:38] dragothicx: overhyped series, bandai namco isn't doing much else than marketing that game on Twitter
[2:15:41] KelticNight: so memorable, yet gave it a 6
[2:15:42] Darkaros: the last one in the franchise soured a lot of people' expectations, I think
[2:15:42] zynessa: Until Dawn is good, the other ones are all M Night Shyamalan fan fiction
[2:15:53] TacoTangler: now the question is... will it be on gamepass Hmm
[2:15:58] Cr4nk3009: will jp play some LOL today?
[2:16:10] MBouland: Guardians of the Galaxy reviews modCheck
[2:16:17] Siphonick: @Cr4nk3009 he said yes earlier
[2:16:22] zerohour_88: I just want the ending to not be terrible like the last one Sadge
[2:16:24] zynessa: @Darkaros Yeah, the last one was like the worst parts of a M Night Shyamalan movie. It was blatantly false advertising.
[2:16:27] TruAxeTV: knew it
[2:16:27] BigWaldo7713: gg ign
[2:16:35] Cr4nk3009: @Siphonick ty mate
[2:16:39] BigWaldo7713: the last 2 were terrible endings
[2:16:40] Nobleprinceps: IGN with the real take Kappa
[2:16:47] OnePunchMac: redacted is play New World !!!!!
[2:16:53] Turk559: "worst game ever" 10/10 Ign
[2:17:12] wheeel: broken mirror weird expression
[2:17:15] Goopymage01: all I need is halo infinite - IGN
[2:17:17] Narnun: IGN gave CoD a 9/10... I trust them as far as I can throw them
[2:17:20] TruAxeTV: mixed
[2:17:28] Norrak1: I mean 75 is pretty much a fine score
[2:17:29] Narnun: and they are made of paper so I can throw them really far
[2:17:40] afreak10: KEKLEO
[2:17:43] TacoTangler: id be happy getting a 75
[2:17:44] BigWaldo7713: they dont have much to compete with
[2:17:55] zerohour_88: wccftech, oof
[2:17:59] KelticNight: 9/10? dude wants to be a box quote NODDERS
[2:18:03] xhaven: @Narnun so they were clearly much less biased than you lol
[2:18:22] BigWaldo7713: D:
[2:18:27] BigWaldo7713: i wanna fuck cars!
[2:18:31] Narnun: @xhaven that's the best you can come up with?
