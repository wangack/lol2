[0:34:55] KAHVITEK: I finished MSQ today Pog
[0:34:55] Sluggs_: some of them are unskippable
[0:34:56] ArcadiusXIV: I play on RU, vertas is quite  ways in
[0:34:57] crawds: some arent but most of it skippable
[0:34:58] Scientist__: hypeE
[0:34:58] Kirino20: @itmeJP  not true
[0:34:58] DarthBrooks__: the opening ones are :(
[0:34:59] Axelnomad: im going to miss the daily demons
[0:35:00] RatekStormcrow: My life is over anyways becasde Shin Megami is coming out and that will take me a decade to finish
[0:35:01] SixPointFive: Only some are unskipable
[0:35:03] NoorElBahrain: you can skip some
[0:35:05] PelleBulldog: only some for the first time
[0:35:09] MagnaCarter_: They're not too long though
[0:35:15] VigilantRich: They are good though so
[0:35:25] Hundisilm: We got all the demons?
[0:35:28] copycoffeecat: unskippable cut scenes should be outlawed
[0:35:29] YorrickBrown: so it is true, there is a story in Lost Ark
[0:35:30] SixPointFive: FF14 daily video perhaps? =P
[0:35:31] bakavic: daily new world bug?
[0:35:32] Scientist__: ijpSAD
[0:35:33] Frog_Quest: start from the beginning
[0:35:34] halofan117arbiter: Forza yesterday was a lot of fun
[0:35:48] SixPointFive: The unskippable cutscenes aren't really cutscenes
[0:35:48] ZarakiK_: oof
[0:35:50] DeadlyBrother: its ilvl not level
[0:35:50] bakavic: the beta is like almost the full game
[0:35:52] Scientist__: is max lvl 50 or 55 ?
[0:35:53] pykseldot: You're looking at around 20 hours to hit level 50.
[0:35:55] ArcadiusXIV: getting to 50 for a new player is probably 25+ hours if youve done it before you can clear story in 15-18 hours
[0:35:56] SixPointFive: They are in-engine story moments
[0:36:00] AlterAngelus: 15-20 hours
[0:36:05] NoorElBahrain: a decade
[0:36:06] shavinglove: not long
[0:36:07] ArcadiusXIV: @itmeJP all raids are lvl 50 content
[0:36:08] Reijm11: its a grind mmo
[0:36:08] NoorElBahrain: ijpSMUG
[0:36:17] crawds: why do you need to kill that guy?
[0:36:20] GrateWhiteDope: I dont blame you
[0:36:21] Scientist__: not worth play a lot in the beta
[0:36:32] shavinglove: \
[0:36:33] PelleBulldog: better to wait for release
[0:36:42] countmarcula: if you're worried about burning through content before tomorrow, it's probably not gonna be an issue LUL
[0:36:43] dragothicx: I tried Lost Ark and found it boring, expected something like PoE and it wasn't, not at all Sadge
[0:36:50] pykseldot: @itmeJP You could use the beta to figure out what class(es) you'd want to play on release, if there's a plan to do that?
[0:36:55] crawds: better to use beta time to find a class you like
[0:36:57] NoorElBahrain: @crawds He posted a yellow background tweet
[0:36:57] the_undying1: The game is heavy on my cpu :(
[0:36:58] ArcadiusXIV: I was shocked the level skip is only after you have first got a char to 50 I thought for a beta they would let eople try the actual content
[0:37:03] GrateWhiteDope: Its ok, I just thought you would start out at lvl 1 not lvl 10 and already have like all ur skills.
[0:37:03] DaeStone: im just using beta to testing stuff
[0:37:08] gooseboy429: march\
[0:37:09] Scientist__: @dragothicx it's an mmo, only thing similar is camera and click to move
[0:37:12] DeadlyBrother: no
[0:37:14] SixPointFive: I mean, the game feels done
[0:37:16] bakavic: the march date is placeholder
[0:37:21] Legionnare92: what game
[0:37:24] Scientist__: march is placeholder , Q1
[0:37:24] ArcadiusXIV: Q1 2022
[0:37:25] SixPointFive: Could release next week and not bat an eye
[0:37:28] pykseldot: It feels pretty done.
[0:37:28] Darkaros: Lost Ark Legionnare92
[0:37:30] frogohn: march is a placeholder date
[0:37:30] NoorElBahrain: Legionnare92 Lost Ark
[0:37:35] SixPointFive: Server stability is 100%
[0:37:42] Scientist__: i thought 2 years
[0:37:46] fluffycatpaww: ingame shop :D
[0:37:47] pykseldot: and localization
[0:37:54] Sluggs_: 4 and 8 man raids looked like ffxiv raids so hoping its fun to play
[0:37:59] NoorElBahrain: I hope they add more regions
[0:38:00] personno4: server stability, localization and monetization
[0:38:03] SixPointFive: Localization is also all done

[0:38:24] VigilantRich: I had no issues and it ran great
[0:38:33] Neragsito: I guess the game doesn't like 5000 series amd cpus from what I've experienced and seen
[0:38:46] the_undying1: makes my CPU very loud
[0:38:49] NoorElBahrain: personno4 Middle East and N. Africa too ijpPRAY
[0:38:52] DeadlyBrother: its not that bad for mmo
[0:38:58] Nogardknight: it's serviceable
[0:38:59] h3ybrian: @itmejp Korean translates oddly to English as well. That’s gotta take some time to get right
[0:38:59] Scientist__: @Neragsito ?
[0:39:06] countmarcula: VA's fine 🤷
[0:39:06] MagnaCarter_: Its no worse than any JRPG
[0:39:11] Nogardknight: not particularly good, but not awful
[0:39:20] Neragsito: @Scientist__ it restarted my pc 4 times, never got ti play
[0:39:21] pykseldot: @Neragsito Runs on my 5950x without issue thus far.
[0:39:26] ArcadiusXIV: when you are getting every single line of dialogue voiced, you dont hire the matt mercers to do your VA
[0:39:34] personno4: @itmeJP lost ark plays pretty well with a controller to
[0:39:47] ArcadiusXIV: its not cost effective
[0:39:52] Scientist__: @Neragsito hmm maybe overheating ? . my temp was like 10c more than other games
[0:39:54] the_ch0: NODDERS
[0:40:14] Thatonekidmike: The i9

[0:41:49] Thatonekidmike: @itmeJP Forbes has benchamrks of all the new cpus vs AMD
[0:41:49] Truder2k: @IAMWILL_24 xeon* LUL
[0:41:56] NinjaPandaEU: Purge the Xenos!
[0:42:00] WDForty: intel has changed how they designed their stuff, instead of stuff as many high power cores in as possible, they're doing a "big little" design, so there's same number of cores as amd's but some of them are "efficency" cores that run lower power

[0:47:21] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: less dependant on gpu and it smore important for cpu

[0:47:29] AnorienNightwish: i was 1080p until recently...
[0:47:31] GraveSalad: for those that don't know, 1080p hits the CPU more, higher res hits GPU more, hence 1080p for CPU benchmarks
[0:47:41] DaRandalizer: thats because of the bottlenecks
[0:47:46] Truder2k: 1080p is to not have the GPU become a bottleneck and interfere with the benchmark results

[0:49:49] DyingEros: You know
[0:49:49] countmarcula: PugetBench = Premiere and Adobe app benchmarks
[0:49:54] murasaur: yeah, but does it run crysis?
[0:49:55] RyanNevill13: benchmarks for working nad not gaminglol
[0:49:57] DyingEros: The people who make all the things we enjoy on the web lul
[0:49:57] AdventuresOfBilly: @AdventuresOfBilly a fair trade
[0:50:00] Truder2k: Puget is productivity (video rendering etc)
[0:50:01] Guomi: Nah, we need Crysis benchmarks
[0:50:04] EscapedShapeshifter: PepoG
[0:50:13] Thatonekidmike: @itmeJP Look at prices for DDR5 its $330 for 32gb
[0:50:18] SavageCheez: So is he saying that this is a workstation cpu?
[0:50:25] Guomi: That sounds positively cheap for 32GB
[0:50:26] GGuts: So for production AMD is still king
[0:50:32] Cygnatus: wandavision crossover
[0:50:48] SlipCrit: maybe thats just canada?
[0:50:49] Guomi: So Intel is still unable to do 7nm
[0:51:00] quaxim: sup
[0:51:01] Madude89: @SavageCheez no it's a gaming one
[0:51:06] RhodesToRome: maximum power POGSLIDE
[0:51:08] Tenivir: Maximum Turbo Power Pog

[0:51:41] yrvengalied: OOF
[0:51:44] Truder2k: performance is really good, but 240W is a ridiculously high power usage on a CPU
[0:51:47] GGuts: Multi Core Enhancement can make your system unstable in some cases
[0:51:48] countmarcula: 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
[0:52:01] Bronst_: Intel marketing always pulls dumb stunts
[0:52:03] Darkaros: TehMud ijpLOVE hope you get well soon
[0:52:15] ZarakiK_: i5 ftw ??
[0:52:15] plasmapunch: Intel just making their shit half as effecient to compete with AMD LUL

[0:52:28] SpaceDive: moore's law monkaS
[0:52:29] Devlind: so all in all, a newer cpu is better than the older ones?

[0:52:58] JBfromAccounting: holy shit
[0:53:00] countmarcula: monkaW
[0:53:03] RyanNevill13: isnt this similar to what the PS5 does?
[0:53:04] zerohour_88: wtf, D15 and still 90 degrees
[0:53:04] Rayzr_McGowan: boost only limited by heat and juice.
[0:53:04] Guomi: cohhNotes so I should disregard everything Linus says if I don't get an overclockable model
[0:53:12] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: I pretty much have no choice but to abandon ITX in the future
[0:53:12] ShuGaming: great as a secondary heater
[0:53:16] CamoVecmin: flark
[0:53:18] murasaur: so, crank the AC to be able to run this bitch
[0:53:24] plasmapunch: Soooo, for most people it's gonna thermal throttle and then be worse than AMD? Probably?
[0:53:32] countmarcula: my 5950x barely hits 75c
[0:53:33] crawds: well winter is coming
[0:53:33] Hemry64_: Thats one expensive space heater
[0:53:34] MKHEROX: that's going to burn a hole through the motherboard
[0:53:38] Arbszy: Clap

[0:55:55] Alanthesheep: i5 makes 97 irrelevant then
[0:56:00] DaRandalizer: the  middle one ( 12700 k) seems to be the most reasonable one
[0:56:00] Alanthesheep: *i7
[0:56:02] shieldwolf: POGGIES
[0:56:10] Greven_pbs: Oh well, still running i7-3770K...
[0:56:12] GGuts: Wait is this I5 more power efficient than the 5600x?
[0:56:13] quaxim: $1600 battery
[0:56:13] mr0ts: costs more than a honda 2200 generator
[0:56:18] NinjaPandaEU: I read the TPU and CompuerBase reviews this morning and they basically said the same thing. 12600K is the true king.
[0:56:20] Marcu5: there's also an i7 that looks interesting
[0:56:23] QDVaughan: happy with my 5900x lol
[0:56:44] GGuts: Because the 5600x is by far the most power efficient gaming CPU on the market
[0:56:49] Sidewinder3121: @itmeJP is there a liveletter today?
[0:56:51] nihilistic_bat: infected mushroom catJAM
[0:56:52] murasaur: my current i7 still got plenty of juice to hold me a few more years, my 1080ti, tho... might stop getting driver updates if nvidia decides to drop it

[0:58:13] Alanthesheep: That video told me that where I was thinking of just getting a new CPU, motherboard and cooler I actually just need to keep the graphics cards, drives and nothing else
[0:58:28] GGuts: Tbh for gamers at 1440p you should consider either the i5‑12600Kor the AMD 5600x. That's my take.
[0:58:29] leovic1: POGGIES

[1:01:39] Devlind: it does make me excited about the future
[1:01:41] Zandivya: Yeah, I still haven't seen Shang Chi
[1:01:41] Neragsito: I heard some nasty stuff
[1:01:44] WDForty: yea critic reviews aren't really something you can look at anymore, unless you find a critic that has very similar to your taste
[1:01:44] Saryuken: critics when they are paid
[1:01:51] DyingEros: Not really. We've been spoiled with the wrap up from the Avengers
[1:02:02] Olegregg88: sometimes you make a film critics don't like
[1:02:04] countmarcula: PepeLaugh

[1:02:07] the_ch0: PepeLaugh
[1:02:08] konataizumi1982: I gave up on movie critics a long time ago
[1:02:09] DyingEros: I'd honestly have to say most Marvel falls high on our side and lower on editors
[1:02:10] NinjaPandaEU: On MetaCritic user score is 5.8, but I don't know their process for verification.
[1:02:15] Arbszy: PepeLaugh

[1:02:27] crawds: wait until you play lost ark and the p2w discussions start
[1:02:27] TaylorMoon1: JP has been bought out by the shadow forces
[1:02:28] personno4: isnt eternals more of a setup movie for the new big bad or big baddies?
[1:02:29] Baske_T: wait patreon creators get paid too right
[1:02:30] Alanthesheep: Is it weird that my new Marvel 'I was entertained' benchmark is now the Guardians game?
[1:02:31] WDForty: critics watch so many movies, that what they enjoy isn't really matching to your average viewer who doesn't watch as many movies and have gotten tired of the same things
[1:02:31] Zaelsus: I don't trust the oxygen in my lungs
[1:02:31] blissfuldan: These are the same fuckers who say IGN always gives COD 10/10 KEKW
[1:02:42] freaker286: I will be curious to see for myself the difference between critics and the audience. I wonder if the critics wanted a Chloe Zaho movie only, and they didn't want any marvel in it
[1:02:46] personno4: BIG STATUE
[1:02:50] arakkus895: I do not know who these characters are at all. So not in a rush to see it.
[1:02:51] Dasutin23: JP is owned by Big Plastic

[1:03:31] crawds: o this weekend is when dexter start airing
[1:03:35] DyingEros: Yeah. Rotten Tomatoes has really ruled the scene
[1:03:40] RyanNevill13: yeah the number is more important than the comments
[1:03:42] DyingEros: Its weird how that has happend
[1:03:43] countmarcula: big plastic is actually just that texas-sized garbage patch in the pacific
[1:03:48] aurice_heartly: Siskel & Ebert were god tier Reviewers @itmeJP

[1:04:25] CamoVecmin: lol
[1:04:25] ModMV: So I have a Lovesac sofa and love it.  They announced this sound system called Stealth Tech.  I just tried it at the mall and it's incredible.  If i get it, i'll never want to go to the movies again
[1:04:28] DyingEros: I don't know a single movie critic
[1:04:28] AnorienNightwish: same @Mujona
[1:04:30] crawds: @itmeJP there is a website with his name still doing reviews
[1:04:35] NinjaPandaEU: @itmeJP There are some news about the Halo Infinite Battlepass plans, in case it wasn't in your list.
