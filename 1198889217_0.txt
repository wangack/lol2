[0:35:57] EnragedPyro: i agree but its not hard to beat to be honest.
[0:35:57] JeXus1985: 10% agree
[0:35:58] gigamesh00: i mean. With tencent backing. yeah @darkaros
[0:35:59] NoorElBahrain: the dota anime was a bit generic

[0:36:10] zhrang911: I think it’s gonna be huge.
[0:36:11] vaizard27: better than castlevania?
[0:36:13] WDPrescott_: I watched the first episode and the production was amazing, but I think I not being into LoL makes it just meh for me
[0:36:14] burgerpirate: Witcher is an adaptation of the novels
[0:36:14] sch1z0: i'm holding judgement till i watch the entire thing

[0:36:30] CtrlAltComplete: clearly, you've never watch Super Marios bros with bob hoskins, dennis hopper and john leguizomo
[0:36:30] BlazeRom: Witcher was average
[0:36:31] zerohour_88: I'm not sure if its better than Castlevania, but I like it so far
[0:36:31] Warmetta: the witcher sucked lol

[0:36:55] league_of_feels: 6 Years in the making
[0:36:55] HadoForReal: Witcher was all over the place
[0:36:56] Darkaros: Texmex33 nah
[0:36:58] Tahkai: Texmex33 no
[0:36:58] ash_licker: it looks fine but the writing is awful
[0:37:00] JumpsOO4: @Cyandor nope, it is freestanding
[0:37:02] SlipCrit: no
[0:37:03] wiggle_everytime_boop: Wheel of Time Series is looking like it's going to be best!
[0:37:06] 7Titans: The gameplay killed it for me. Quest and fighting was pretty repetitive
[0:37:06] Serenity7: No
[0:37:06] SlipCrit: i know nothign and its great
[0:37:09] Vendiktuss: honestly I went into it with 0 expectations but got a lot out of the show.
[0:37:11] wiggle_everytime_boop: I'm super excited about that
[0:37:12] WayneG947: You mean the anime Witcher?
[0:37:14] ZeniteZero: Idk, I enjoyed the witcher series. Wasn't MINDBLOWING, but it was entertaining.
[0:37:14] sch1z0: nope i didn't know squat
[0:37:18] NPSJason: The Witcher is good purely because of the cast, while arcane is stellar in every aspect
[0:37:18] peiman92: What about the dota 2 show?
[0:37:19] SMonTwitch: okay great, thats what I was wondering. I don't know anything about LoL
[0:37:23] Texmex33: thats awesome to hear! I will check it out today then for sure! thanks!
[0:37:25] JansonLives: I know nothing about LoL and fucking loved the first 3 episodes.
[0:37:27] Devlind: I know nothing about elague and Arcane was great
[0:37:27] LazyNekos: the nods to the lore are cool but yeah no need
[0:37:27] SMonTwitch: Will watch it tonight then
[0:37:28] eLMaQ: i think knowing nothing is even better
[0:37:29] SgtStruthers: Nope.  I dont like LOL and i liked the show
[0:37:29] Goraxypox: agreed
[0:37:32] Darkaros: I'd happily recommend Arcane as an everyday fantasy anime adventure, LoL or no
[0:37:32] seamroy: I know nothing and thought it was pretty middling. I think knowing stuff might add a lot for people
[0:37:34] Jzimmy15: it does feel cool to hear the character name an make the connection it almost feels like you know behind the scenes
[0:37:35] The_Shift_Key: I don't like MOBAs so I'm glad they're doing other LoL content
[0:37:35] Haeher: yeah the first three epsiodes were a banger i know nothing of league lore NODDERS
[0:37:38] unreliable_witness: I can't watch that show without automatically thinking about a bellowing mass of frothing toxic kids.
[0:37:40] Hese_1: every character is introduced in someway
[0:37:40] ReginaldXIV: I hope Vi looks around at some people and says "What are we? Some sort of League... Of Legends?
[0:37:42] Old_Lenny_Biscuits: Can I watch it if I hate LoL and everything to do with it?
[0:37:44] johnfive21: agreed
[0:37:44] Syllvn: I know nothing really and it was great
[0:37:46] pa_TIENce: like, they didn't even call Zaun by its name until Ep 3
[0:37:47] EyevisLive: aggreed
[0:37:47] Shoaron: how?
[0:37:48] JumpsOO4: I haven't played since early 2012 and it is my favorite show in a long time
[0:37:49] MonsterPek: its just an origin movie for a lot of characters, i liked it
[0:37:50] NiloxofAsgard: agreed
[0:37:52] FaceMcShooty: i goggled every person on screen
[0:37:53] Nurama: sort of
[0:37:54] Kei_L: YEP
[0:37:54] CuteFakeEgirl: you can predict the plot a bit if you know league a lot ye
[0:37:55] EnragedPyro: i agree. you know how it will kindfa end
[0:37:57] Jura27: film/music label Riot is making a game? :)
[0:38:03] SZebra: Well, you've sold me on watching ep 2 & 3 this evening then.
[0:38:04] Nurama: but some of its guessing and stuff which is neat
[0:38:05] Dr4gonb0rn_: Never played League but good did i want to after the first ep!
[0:38:07] Yorolek: Is the show complete or will it release weekly?
[0:38:09] ZeniteZero: I wish Wizards of the Coast did something like Arcane with the Magic: The Gathering universe.
[0:38:11] sch1z0: if u wanna like fangirl from the name drops then ya knowing LoL would help there
[0:38:11] Shoaron: nah, I get hyped when I see the characters and trying to guess who is who before name drops
[0:38:12] Lindobu: don't they feel like easter eggs instead?
[0:38:16] Destello11: @Shoaron e.g. you expect Powder to transform into her ingame personality
[0:38:16] Darkaros: 3 episodes a week Yorolek
[0:38:17] SkywardRaven: having the tie ins as a league player is great though
[0:38:20] ag_blues: If you play LoL it's just noticing easter eggs.
[0:38:22] JansonLives: This makes me more hype the Riot MMO
[0:38:22] TamboTv: who sang it ?
[0:38:28] sapphirescale: the show is fucking great

[0:38:37] EnragedPyro: the 3 song from the 3 episode are on spotify
[0:38:37] ZeniteZero: Riot does have very good art and music direction.
[0:38:38] slayer78456: I don't think it makes it worse. It's been great for me to see how champions came to be what we know them as
[0:38:40] Nurama: yeah id say having knowledge of league doesnt make it worse, its like saying having comic knowledge ruins the MCU movies
[0:38:48] ThePointGaming: they did a good job of making the first 3 episodes a mini arch story
[0:38:51] DaggerDaggers: The end of episode 3 was ijpPOGGERS
[0:38:51] Poriand: i want the Riot MMO
[0:38:51] zhrang911: Riot has always made incredible music
[0:38:52] Shoaron: @Destello11 nah, man I'm totally hyped for the journey she takes to become who she is

[0:39:02] SmileyBoloney: LoLCU
[0:39:03] NinjaPandaEU: A shared-media universe.

[0:39:23] MartymusPrime95: Think of a animated Warhammer 40k series with that studio ijpD
[0:39:23] johnfive21: and then Ghostcrawler ruins it KEKW
[0:39:23] Kagutsuchiii: yeah that be great
[0:39:24] Dariumdragonheart: League should not be a thing lol
[0:39:25] LazyNekos: Money
[0:39:25] Eplesh: the thought about the mmo is making me feel things

[0:41:43] Jiinglle: Fuck off Activision
[0:41:43] NoorElBahrain: @JimBODii it's good

[0:41:55] 1TrueTyrant: @jimbodii its insanely good
[0:41:56] Onefootstout: wonder if corporate was so burned by how bad Warcraft movie did that it's prevented them from trying to do something similar to dota and lol
[0:41:56] WayneG947: It can't do anything, absorb and rebrand possibly?
[0:41:58] epicshoo: Blizzard should start making some slot machines PepegaPls
[0:42:03] SgtStruthers: They hire more woman that will quit when they see how awful it is there zekeKEK
[0:42:03] Devlind: @ZeniteZero oh yea, I remember now.

[0:42:08] BlazeRom: Blizzard is toast
[0:42:08] Nogardknight: D4 comes out, 'last epoch/PoE2/etc'
[0:42:09] Ribbons_Almark: agreed
[0:42:11] restartdreamertv: problem right now no one wanna join or get a job by blizzard right ? monkaHmm
[0:42:13] NoorElBahrain: even if they rebrand the rep will still be there
[0:42:14] JeedanJune: Digiiorno 4
[0:42:14] ThePointGaming: that stigma is gonna take a LONG time to be washed away...if ever
[0:42:17] JumpsOO4: Riot is doing everything I expected Blizzard to do 10 years ago
[0:42:17] seamroy: Blizzard feels like its rotted from inside and out. Not sure how much recovery is possible anymore
[0:42:18] Hikyy: meta snow Kappa
[0:42:19] sch1z0: metazzard
[0:42:21] Jura27: McBlizzard

[0:42:27] ReginaldXIV: Flurry POGGIES
[0:42:28] AnnieJella: From blizzard to snowflake bogaHmm
[0:42:28] DockterMan: agreed it's tarnished AF now
[0:42:28] BlazeRom: I feel bad somewhat for the devs working on Diablo 4
[0:42:31] Altair900: They absolutely have to. That is the ONLY way anything of theirs will ever get back to "normal"
[0:42:31] Flyspeck42: change to meta
[0:42:32] gigamesh00: aint bobby trying to do that
[0:42:32] sapphirescale: i dont think diablo 4 can save unless its the best game in the last ten years
[0:42:32] WayneG947: Firestorm
[0:42:32] boki_86: yes
[0:42:33] Proph89: yep
[0:42:33] ZeniteZero: They need to become a decent company, that's what they need, first and foremost
[0:42:35] MartymusPrime95: Yeah
[0:42:36] johnfive21: sort of
[0:42:36] Catelfy92: they should learn from Zuck Kappa
[0:42:37] Shoaron: not as bad
[0:42:37] JumpsOO4: yeah
[0:42:38] boki_86: it was worse
[0:42:39] ArgonFalcon: its not like changing executives is gonna matter, the Blizzard of today is not the blizzard of 15 years ago, their talent tleft
[0:42:41] apb____: namechange to Facebook
[0:42:41] Sonatta: riot got away with it, like ubisoft
[0:42:42] ramask2: Blizzard needs an ARR but for the whole brand
[0:42:43] DockterMan: and Ubisoft
[0:42:43] Kymix: It wasn't as bad
[0:42:43] IthnanCryo: I doubt that would do anything at this point
[0:42:43] ReginaldXIV: Riot threw money at it quicker
[0:42:44] NinjaPandaEU: @KatjeMauw Point taken. They're still good though, and people critisizing the animations are dumb.
[0:42:45] CuteFakeEgirl: riot decided to branch out before it was a real issue
[0:42:45] SgtStruthers: No one died
[0:42:47] JumpsOO4: Its hard to compare
[0:42:49] nimrickz: blizzard is now actisoft Kappa
[0:42:51] Shunkan: They got away with it
[0:42:52] Kultak: CAN didn't sue them, did they?
[0:42:54] Neragsito: it was years ago
[0:42:54] semiiotic: they got away with it sadly
[0:42:55] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP money solves problems KEKW
[0:42:55] CuteFakeEgirl: oh youre talking about that KEKW
[0:42:55] Morycce: they just need to make games again  be quiet
[0:42:57] Kymix: Riot didn't have a Cosby Suite
[0:42:57] KatjeMauw: NinjaPandaEU agreed
[0:43:00] seamroy: Amazing that they were the activision acquisition that got to keep their name due to prestige. And now this.
[0:43:00] NezeruGaming: Riot was just as bad, but people have short memories and the media already forgot.
[0:43:00] Neragsito: so reaction was lesser
[0:43:02] SZebra: RIOT was never a beloved company. Blizzard was, and so had further to fall.
[0:43:02] boki_86: riot did a turn around
[0:43:03] ZeniteZero: Well, Riot's case wasn't the state of California investigating them for 2 years
[0:43:09] BlueIceMoon: Riot didn't continuously make the news in a negative way for over a month
[0:43:09] bromanatee: riot's games aren't shit, WoW is deep in the shitter
[0:43:09] Neragsito: the reaction was mora tame...
[0:43:10] DockterMan: it's a industry wide problem I think
[0:43:11] ligmajohnsonson: Riot was able to cover most there bases
[0:43:14] Hese_1: everything was bought to silence Kappa
[0:43:15] BlazeRom: true, people cared less about Riot
[0:43:15] NyeTheScienceGuy: blizzard responded very poorly
[0:43:15] kibriel: true
[0:43:21] WDPrescott_: At this point, I kinda don't want D4, just stop everything that isn't out and needs support. I feel like Blizzard is memory now
[0:43:22] JumpsOO4: Blizzard was hit hardest compared to Ubisoft and Riot for sure
[0:43:24] alexanderlille: Riot just made sure to quickly solve it
[0:43:25] SZebra: Fair
[0:43:28] restartdreamertv: riot have alot of good artist that create those character
[0:43:29] Siggenlh: Riot managed their PR better.
[0:43:30] Kymix: YEP
[0:43:30] TheMeromex: meeeehhhh
[0:43:30] ZeniteZero: Idk, Riot is pretty beloved by a lot of people
[0:43:31] Shin_gx: @Kagutsuchiii really ? I doubt many ppl care about it much anymore tbh, and it's not like it's gonna be either that interesting or filled with new stuff. It's pretty much a 1.5 version with some QoL stuff in it
[0:43:34] MrTrotty: @itmeJP riot, EA, ubisoft every game company has gone over this at this point, it'll blow over in time, everyone was shitting on blizz and most of those people bought diablo remaster, nothing will change
[0:43:39] shadowoflight_: blizzard was a betrayal
[0:43:41] ArgonFalcon: I mean blizzard had other problems, years of lazy dev in WOW, trying to switch to mobile markets. Firing 10% of the company on a year where they made record profits
[0:43:45] The_Faceless_Void: not as much as blizzard
[0:43:45] WayneG947: Riot is beloved, just not here
[0:43:45] JBfromAccounting: Riot fixed stuff right away compared to blizzard
[0:43:46] johnfive21: Riot is not beloved. League players hate Riot KEKW
[0:43:47] Vylas_: @itmeJP Riot get shit on by LOL players too
[0:43:47] gigamesh00: we riot
[0:43:50] TamboTv: people who plays league shits on riot too :D
[0:43:51] sapphirescale: is it riot or lol that people like toh
[0:43:52] Neragsito: but riot has what... 10 years as a company? Blizzard has like 30
[0:43:52] ReginaldXIV: (Dota is still the better moba CrungoCycle )
[0:43:54] DockterMan: it was hard seeing Blizzard turn into this
[0:43:55] RitzC: funnily enough there was a "leak" over a month ago that said they are rebranding next year, seems more necesarry as time goes on
[0:43:56] NiloxofAsgard: eh i played league for years and still shit on riot, but that's mostly cause it's funny and memey
[0:44:00] TheodenArratay: riot is 100% beloved, unfortunately as imo with the allegations and walkouts they shouldnt be
[0:44:01] Morycce: nah they aren't beloved
[0:44:03] Jiinglle: ReginaldXIV NODDERS
[0:44:08] ligmajohnsonson: I think people just wanted to find an excuse to stop playing WOW XD
[0:44:08] Nogardknight: blizz is still making questionable announcements, which doesn't help
[0:44:10] JumpsOO4: @MrTrotty Funnily enough EA is to said to have the best workplace in the industry
[0:44:12] seamroy: @ReginaldXIV its okay, when you're right you're right
[0:44:14] Warped_Oblivion: riot is not beloved at all lmao
[0:44:15] SlipCrit: blizzard is worse cuz theyve apparently been shit all alogn and we didnt know
[0:44:17] ZeniteZero: Btw, never idolize companies, chat. It is not a good time.
[0:44:18] shadowoflight_: er...no blizzard was a giant before the MMO
[0:44:19] Freezetrap: blizzard is older and thus had longer to become revered for many people
[0:44:19] restartdreamertv: WC3 where RTS was really hype like starcraft back then
[0:44:20] Siggenlh: heh dodd
[0:44:20] SgtStruthers: @ReginaldXIV stripPout has marci so yes
[0:44:23] Siggenlh: dodo
[0:44:24] Eplesh: DUDE I am so HYPED
[0:44:24] Nogardknight: plus, pretty much everyone hates bobby kotick
[0:44:27] Buffmages: and fighting game Pog
[0:44:29] Jura27: Riot's music and eSports was beloved but devs were shit on a lot
[0:44:29] ReginaldXIV: Marci ijpNODDERS
[0:44:33] 1TrueTyrant: RCU incoming Pog
[0:44:36] sunbeamEU: @itmeJP maybe different times, you know, in the past, it was not so much blow out and tightly watched
[0:44:37] LinearkNT: Yep Riot has an MMO, Fighting game, and an ARPG we know nothing about lol
[0:44:37] Jukettaja: MMOs are hard to pull off though
[0:44:39] snuffles_80: No King rules forever
[0:44:39] KAHVITEK: im too hyped for the mmo Sadge
[0:44:39] SirMeatusSirloin: I hope the fighting game is cool
[0:44:40] BenSilencing: there was enough dirt on Riot, that it was a bit surprising that Erin went there
[0:44:40] LazyNekos: they are prepping for the death of LoL
[0:44:40] restartdreamertv: I think most people play WoW because they had people to play with them monkaHmm
[0:44:43] zerohour_88: even now people are saying the anime is good despite Riot games LUL
[0:44:44] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP Blizzard had starcraft and warcraft and books made before riot even was a thing. I would say blizzard is most beloved
[0:44:45] Devlind: what do we actually know about the riot mmo?
[0:44:46] CorporalPibb: even if it's decent it'll take a chunk out of WoW
[0:44:46] league_of_feels: Ive played League forever
[0:44:47] zynessa: Riot is super beloved, they weren't five years ago though KEKW
[0:44:48] JumpsOO4: I am want to live in a Runeterra MMO
[0:44:50] bromanatee: blizzard had a long slew of bad expansions and remasters prior to the lawsuit
[0:44:50] shadowoflight_: Blizzard was the 'take their time to make awesome games' company, even before the MMOs
[0:44:52] 1TrueTyrant: Riot Cinematic Universe
[0:44:54] Eplesh: Riot are not beloved COPIUM
[0:44:56] Whiskeydog23: blow them up in a good or bad way?
[0:44:56] TheMeromex: never cared for riot but do a poll to check instead
[0:44:57] CuteFakeEgirl: people love riots music and art team, their devs get shit on a lot tho
[0:44:57] Catelfy92: MMO killer - MMO the company killer Kappa
[0:44:58] Vaan_GG: League player for like 10 sears riot gets shit all the time but riot music stuff is always liked
[0:45:00] ZeniteZero: "Not beloved"... I mean, financials state otherwise.
[0:45:04] Jzimmy15: riot is beloved or people wouldnt play the game they just get alot of shit because people are passionate
[0:45:07] Jukettaja: I wonder what approach Riot will take with their MMO
[0:45:07] RitzC: Riot is definitely beloved
[0:45:08] sapphirescale: i think people dont like riot but like there products
[0:45:09] The_Faceless_Void: prestige
[0:45:10] Layercake: Riot does have the Blizzard legacy
[0:45:10] Gusty331: The felling towards Riot is not the same. Blizzard was god
[0:45:11] NinjaPandaEU: @jumps004 Yeah EA had a big workplace scandal years ago and did a lot to change internally. By all accounts they're a good place to work at since then.
[0:45:11] xarantur: Riot has been basically talking about making an MMO for about 6+ years and now actually doing it
[0:45:12] semiiotic: id say riots games are not the company name like blizzard
[0:45:13] redyety: cult?
[0:45:13] ThePointGaming: Blizzard leaned into their communities goodwill
[0:45:13] Eplesh: Cult
[0:45:14] SgtStruthers: I think when you get a certain age you realize not to love companies but the good people that work there
[0:45:15] LazyNekos: cult ?
[0:45:17] johnfive21: they had cult following
[0:45:18] Eplesh: 100% a cult
[0:45:22] afreak10: pretty much
[0:45:23] jeffhunter12: ha
[0:45:25] restartdreamertv: cult monkaHmm
[0:45:26] Jiinglle: NODDERS
[0:45:26] semiiotic: yeah a cult
[0:45:26] The_Faceless_Void: TRUE
[0:45:27] jeffhunter12: bikeL
[0:45:28] league_of_feels: I want them to take their SWEET time on it dont RUSH that MMO
[0:45:29] Darnitz: blizzard has a fanatic base @itmeJP
[0:45:29] BlazeRom: KEKHeim
[0:45:29] Brogeta92: cult
[0:45:30] Vendiktuss: "cultish" yeah
[0:45:31] MartymusPrime95: Didnt they hire fans?
[0:45:31] league_of_feels: dont*
[0:45:32] WDPrescott_: @dontcarebear1983 the general populace never knew about blizzard until Wow, where Riot has always been known because of LoL and forward
[0:45:33] epicshoo: the people saying Riot isn't beloved need to get their head out of their ass WTFF
[0:45:34] BlazeRom: LUL
[0:45:36] Nogardknight: house of mouse monkaHmm
[0:45:39] Gliverz: almost?
[0:45:41] CorporalPibb: ijpNODDERS
[0:45:41] jeffhunter12: i mean im def a part of the cult of warcraft
[0:45:41] InternetPlumber: they tried to sell the blizzard family shit to people
[0:45:42] SlipCrit: which made the employees even more douchey
[0:45:44] DockterMan: pretty much
[0:45:46] TheMeromex: thy didnt have that many fans
[0:45:47] LinearkNT: KEKHeim KEKHeim
[0:45:47] Wrizzik: People would go to Blizzcon to find spouses (so, cult)
[0:45:48] ZeniteZero: Honestly, people have too many emotional memories related to WoW and Blizzard, so I get that they are getting a pretty rough reality check.
[0:45:49] Ratspunk: the cult of KDA
[0:45:49] d0ndieg046: i mean... in asia they do
[0:45:51] unsimulacrum: I kinda feel like its similar to very hardcore apple people
[0:45:56] afreak10: KDA Cult
[0:45:56] GoomyGod: @itmeJP https://riotxarcane.riotgames.com/en-us/ Look at this arcane web game they made. Press Explore to get into it
[0:46:03] Kymix: Riot had a terrible marketing team tbh. they focused on league for almost 10 years
[0:46:03] NezeruGaming: Riot has a cult in asian countries especially china.
[0:46:04] CuteFakeEgirl: KEKHeim
[0:46:06] Ceaseless_: jp bout to be a riot partner now lol
[0:46:13] shadowoflight_: riot was respected never loved.. blizzard was loved, and they made great games consistently, even before WoW
[0:46:15] ligmajohnsonson: Blizzard was far closer to there audience compared to riot that is for sure
[0:46:15] JourneyingJen: Blizzard was more of a "household name"
[0:46:19] gigamesh00: that diablo immortal moment will always be remembered
[0:46:20] R3nZiO: riot never went out of their way to celebrate themselves like blizzard
[0:46:22] Kei_L: LUL
[0:46:26] Nogardknight: Riot WAS pretty much only League for 10 years
[0:46:27] restartdreamertv: I am quite surprise that alot of people realise now that they waste there time with WoW now monkaHmm
[0:46:27] Brandling: I have a hard time understanding why people appeal to "I've loved this company" argument.
[0:46:35] bromanatee: they killed their lore team like 3 times
[0:46:40] Nogardknight: with like one or two tiny side projects
[0:46:40] AtomJar: riot has the problem thatevery game somone plays of lol 50% of the players have a bad time
[0:46:44] teffy42: ehh what has Riot done to make them "beloved", they're just popular due to their hugely successful game
[0:46:44] ZeniteZero: Riot has a pretty decent strategy right now.
[0:46:47] SgtStruthers: *Stole a moba Kappa
[0:46:50] rumpeteer: RedHairEverywhere subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:46:50] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing RedHairEverywhere! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:46:50] Kymix: they were slow to build up on that
[0:46:54] WDPrescott_: @shadowoflight_ for gamers, but if you asked a random person pre-Wow about starcraft or warcraft they wouldn't know what you are talking about
[0:46:56] Ribbons_Almark: its been 10yrs since I started League.... dang
[0:46:57] jeffhunter12: yeah riot fucks with its lore too much which makes things like arcane scary
[0:46:57] CuteFakeEgirl: well they were working on side projects for a few years no? before the 10th year annoucement with all the stuff
[0:47:00] boki_86: i mean moba is a genre
[0:47:02] Vendiktuss: ye it depends where you look at all the factors, riotgames are so huge in some asian regions that it is similar to a religiosus movement lol
[0:47:04] KatjeMauw: its like bliz never made sc and wc, or the dwarf games, etc, blizz had legacy far before wow
[0:47:11] ScaredMoneyWontMakeMoney: Moba just doesn't lean itself to gatherings like MMOs do
[0:47:12] Soma_321: kind of like valve
[0:47:13] Puretaz: is Arcane about the mobile characters
[0:47:16] zynessa: @dontcarebear1983 Outside of Korea? Nah man. They were big, but not "everybody including your parents knows about this game"-big.
[0:47:24] boki_86: yes it was crazy
[0:47:24] MartymusPrime95: No??
[0:47:26] KAHVITEK: Theres an "avatar creator" on leagues site which opens in 5 days Hmm
[0:47:26] Ignisgladius: Eeeh kinda. Arcane was 6 years in the making and all the other games were planned to be announced at the 10th anniversary as they did
[0:47:28] xxunklekarlxx: Didn't they do like a boardgame or something a few years ago?
[0:47:28] Hangfish: Arcane is really fucking good though.
[0:47:29] BlazeRom: what videos?
[0:47:29] LinearkNT: Yeah lol it was nuts
[0:47:29] johnfive21: yeah that was insane
[0:47:29] Shin_gx: nope
[0:47:31] JumpsOO4: Oh of the win
[0:47:31] NinjaPandaEU: Yeah thousands of people in the streets.

[1:02:10] Twizzlar: how are there people streaming ep 2 & 3? they allowing that?
[1:02:14] Vendiktuss: and increase by about 35% trust me
[1:02:20] NiloxofAsgard: the cardgame is good i'd suggest that for anyone wishign to learn mroe about runeterra
[1:02:23] xarantur: Wild rift is actually better than pc version funnily enough lul
[1:02:25] NiloxofAsgard: much more stress free
[1:02:25] Baludor: @Twizzlar Yea, they're letting certain people do it
[1:02:30] Twizzlar: oh ok
[1:02:41] Skyform: episode 3 was a banger
[1:02:43] boki_86: did Riot ever tell the lore of this game in non writen form?
[1:02:49] KAHVITEK: Have you played trough Nier Automata?
[1:03:05] xarantur: @boki_86 they did a few events uin game for that
[1:03:07] DeadlyBrother: @boki_86 there's a lot of videos that do some lore
[1:03:11] Wubsian: Pokemon Unite is a good MOBA to start with bggHmm
[1:03:11] Boonia: @boki_86 some short videos and stuff
[1:03:13] revroom: some could stream but had to purge everything after
[1:03:14] Gliverz: anyone remember "Yannick, why you dead so quick?"
[1:03:22] BlueIceMoon: Scarra said there were apparently some people that streamed the three episodes that weren't allowed to
[1:03:26] DeadlyBrother: YES PLS
[1:03:28] Nurama: Oooh that would be FUN
[1:03:29] johnfive21: ijpPOGGERS

[1:03:32] Nurama: They are SO good
[1:03:32] johnfive21: that will be fun
[1:03:33] Boonia: @boki_86 they also have some comics made by marvel
[1:03:33] TamboTv: that would be cool!
[1:03:34] JeXus1985: OH SHIIIIIIT
[1:03:35] Kruptein: the cinematics are amazing
[1:03:36] NeoLx_: YES!
[1:03:37] thatguyuknow985: Oooo Annie cinematic is cool

[1:03:46] Nurama: twist of fate is great
[1:03:46] KAHVITEK: PauseChamp
[1:03:46] Vendiktuss: yes all of them are good
[1:03:46] Darkaros: all it took for JP to play Nier was a concert, and all it took for JP to play Witcher was a TV series
[1:03:47] nightsreach: you should, they're great
[1:03:47] JeXus1985: the yordle one might be my favourite, it's so dumb
[1:03:48] johnfive21: they're really good
[1:03:48] Anarrima7: yes, really good
[1:03:49] alexanderlille: They are nice
[1:03:50] Mill0u: thats a lot of cinematics
[1:03:51] Baludor: There's honestly not a huge amount of them
[1:03:51] ZeroDjinn: need to watch the budget cinematic its great
[1:03:57] Boonia: @itmejp have u check out any of the comics marvel made for league?
[1:04:06] Baludor: But Jinx was actually one of the best champ reveals back in the day
[1:04:22] KAHVITEK: Sion monkaW
[1:04:23] IthnanCryo: Concert was after your playthrough i believe
[1:04:23] 14neo: probably yeah monkaHmm
[1:04:24] m3rcer: get jinxed!
[1:04:29] Anarrima7: never played LoL, but seen many of the cinamatics ijpFLURK ijpFLURK
[1:04:31] ToeKnee147: yes, its why you wanted to go to the concert i thought?
[1:04:38] LinearkNT: I wonder why
[1:04:39] Darkaros: ijpHMM Wait actually ya it was the FFXIV collab
[1:04:41] Miros__: waht's the stat's tracker tool jp uses?
[1:04:48] nJeansu: hey jp you probably answered this in chat but what are your thoughts on Arcane? @itmeJP
[1:04:54] Jura27: you can listen to champion themes from Riot's YouTube playlist, they are awesome
[1:05:30] Twizzlar: man that episode 3, I need more now, why they do it to su
[1:05:33] Xinder88: better than the dota 2 anime?
[1:05:37] Holrend: even if you dont know the game its good
[1:05:40] MayKing: is there gonna be 9 episodes of Arcane in total?
[1:05:40] Buffmages: have to watch ep 2, and 3
[1:05:41] 14neo: oh i didn't hear JP's take summarized like that before, pretty good :O
[1:05:43] dudwasup: Can video game classical concert be a write off?
[1:05:43] Crosseye_Jack: Although, the RE movies are that bad they are kinda good
[1:05:47] Lutcha81: i need more tv show recomendations from here, almost done with succesion and only 3 episodes in arcane
[1:05:49] reminkly: I still can't believe you've never watched the cinematics @itmeJP
[1:05:51] aroobie: castlevanias pretty great too
[1:05:53] Haeher: @MayKing yeah
[1:06:00] KAHVITEK: @Crosseye_Jack YEP
[1:06:02] thanh_n2004: the OW stuff had promise i thought
[1:06:08] MayKing: @MayKing sick, classic three act structure then
[1:06:08] TheodenArratay: the dota 2 animes were certainly animated YEP
[1:06:10] VintageZ: still wierd how Riot is just not missing meanwhile Blizz implodes
[1:06:10] JumpsOO4: The animation drew me in, the characters made me stay
[1:06:17] DyingEros: OW is the greatest disappointment
[1:06:22] Darkaros: AYAYA
[1:06:25] manemancam: i feel like some people wont call it a video game adaptation cuz its animated and not live action
[1:06:36] Shoaron: ws it mocapped?
[1:06:41] Neragsito: it's amazing, that shit blew me out
[1:06:42] restartdreamertv: which show again ?
[1:06:43] JumpsOO4: it was so fluid
[1:06:44] m3rcer: rotorscope or what its called
[1:06:45] MayKing: it really looks mocapped
[1:06:45] zerohour_88: 3D animation is so damn advanced now, even fans made are great
[1:06:47] Neragsito: Arcane
[1:06:49] Pewlitzer: it reminds me a bit of the new darkest dungeon look with the cell shade
[1:06:51] sch1z0: some ppl say it looks dishonory
[1:06:51] Darkaros: the fighting choreography in ep 1 was amazing
[1:06:52] NPSJason: it looks like someone straight up animated a comic book at pixar quality animation
[1:06:55] boki_86: @itmeJP it looks a lot like "Klaus"
[1:06:56] restartdreamertv: Arcane is not so anime
[1:06:57] JumpsOO4: the facial expressions were out of this world
[1:07:03] MartymusPrime95: Man Vi fights were so cool
[1:07:05] reminkly: Arcane had to re-do their animation tools because they were designed around 2-3 minute shorts
[1:07:06] restartdreamertv: its more like the LOL artstyle of animation
[1:07:09] reminkly: Fortiche*
[1:07:17] Morycce: they have been pioneering new animation techniques for awhile. they ways tauted that at hiring conventions
[1:07:17] league_of_feels: It looks so good
[1:07:19] MayKing: it was the crying faces that did it for me, like the face fluid was spot on
[1:07:20] kooshy_j: well it took 6 years so, it better look great LUL
[1:07:23] NezeruGaming: Arcane is the best non-anime adaptation. Fate's animes are consistently bangers.
[1:07:28] Whiskeydog23: @itmeJP Arcane gives me Dishonored vibes
[1:07:42] restartdreamertv: they working alot on PC to create those animation but I dont know about drawing on paper monkaHmm
[1:07:43] maaadmarty: I thought Arcane was going to be awful and cringy but it was actually genuinely a very fun watch
[1:07:59] Jukettaja: Oh hey we're Leaguign
[1:08:00] JustLikeAMetaphor: Seems like theres more and more good stuff coming out in that 2.5D style
[1:08:03] KAHVITEK: Animation style was pretty cool in Arcane. Kudos to the studio.
[1:08:10] WDPrescott_: probably just had enough money to buy powerful enough rigs to render the animations at higher quality. You could probably get that same quality from recent star wars animations but Disney wouldn't spend the money on that
[1:08:14] Gliverz: what other adc's have you tried?\
[1:08:16] league_of_feels: @Whiskeydog23 Im kinda with you there
[1:08:16] Haeher: huh didnt know there were league heroes on mounts rooIsee
[1:08:36] Darkaros: @Gliverz Trist (he still plays a lot of her) and Xanah (tried it and disliked it)
[1:08:45] NPSJason: @Haeher Sejuani is one of the oldest champions in the game and rides a giant board
[1:08:46] Morycce: @wdprescott_ nah its not just a power thing. it's art choices and techniques
[1:08:55] NPSJason: boar*
[1:08:55] JeXus1985: man, some of the hit indicators are so broken in this game :D the length of Leona's stun lance goes way beyond its indicator for instance
[1:08:58] Gliverz: @Darkaros oh, so not a lot. k thx
[1:09:02] league_of_feels: LUL
[1:09:03] Haeher: @Haeher rooIsee
[1:09:07] Kagutsuchiii: crush down yes.. but the stun is the line ability. no?
[1:09:10] pa_TIENce: zyra should do more than walking around
[1:09:24] WDPrescott_: @Morycce true, but those choices are similar to starwars cartoons
[1:09:30] Rodwolt: oof
[1:09:32] SteelMansfield: pain
[1:09:35] enricofairme: KEKW
[1:09:36] m3rcer: KEKW

[1:09:44] enricofairme: monkaS
[1:09:48] MartymusPrime95: Well she roots.....
[1:09:49] Shoaron: zyra has a root not a stun Hmm
[1:09:50] Apukamu: D:
[1:09:51] kooshy_j: LUL The toxicity
[1:09:51] DyingEros: Glad to see nothing has changed in LoL
[1:09:52] Jiinglle: oHNO
[1:09:54] Keyah: She used it on the engage
[1:09:54] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP you might have said something but I wonder how many people have picked jinx and or Vi since last night
[1:09:55] Jiinglle: Ohno*
[1:10:04] Eravall: it was still on cd from the random ass root she shot out in the wave
[1:10:04] Rodwolt: ijpKEK
[1:10:04] Swerdna: Yup, you're a League player

[1:10:10] NercesK: PJSalt
[1:10:17] Twizzlar: she got the root there LUL
[1:10:19] MayKing: classic chat pedantism
[1:10:21] JeXus1985: what made it worse is that it was Zyra's misplay from the start and you're the one paying for it
[1:10:22] kooshy_j: this is your brain on LoL
[1:10:27] littlebluejay: Are we in halo waiting mode
[1:10:49] Darkaros: !jpedia

[1:11:32] DyingEros: Aww LoL. Never change
[1:11:37] Boonia: she missed a second point blank root
[1:11:50] DyingEros: @Boonia I didn
[1:11:57] DyingEros: I didn't want to say it KEKW
[1:11:58] UnboundSouls: i think theres an unwritten rule that if you push a lane in you have 20 second before jungle comes in
[1:12:16] Duncain: LUL
[1:12:43] shywolf: ijpSIP
[1:13:23] pa_TIENce: still 1 for 1
[1:13:33] Keyah: They got a 1 for 1 and you got dragon. It's fine.
[1:13:41] HahaHazer: To secure dragon he also delayed & killed their jungler to
[1:13:46] zinkmanne: kept them from contesting drag and still traded 1 for 1
[1:13:49] Keyah: Yeah, he got the jungler
[1:13:52] Archangel3003: Ah Xerath, a champion who excels at range goes in toe to toe with 3 of them lol
[1:14:01] Rodwolt: huh, why are the towers different?
[1:14:09] garry_leonard: yeah seemed worth. Got a kill and they distracted from dragon
[1:14:26] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:14:32] HahaHazer: They look 'Arcane' Themed if that makes sense Rodwolt idk if thats why
[1:14:44] Boonia: chat did someone make a Sion video recently I have seen way to much split push Sion this week
[1:14:47] zinkmanne: @Rodwolt they added some map accents for the the show event
[1:15:14] Rodwolt: ah, that would make sense thank you guys
[1:15:17] zinkmanne: minions are different too
[1:15:56] W_Tile: how goes the league and the legends?

[1:16:49] Twizzlar: wards don't do damage

[1:17:07] Jiinglle: W_Tile COPIUM
[1:17:25] HolyTwister: good afternoon @itmejp and chat. just popping in to say Arcane is really good so far and I'm glad others are enjoying it.
[1:17:52] Darkaros: ijpNODDERS JP enjoyed it a lot too
[1:17:53] oaktree3: she may be XD
[1:17:56] HahaHazer: I hope she is or she needs to get checked lol
[1:18:00] W_Tile: Zyra come on, I can't defend you if you keep with this shit
[1:18:01] UnboundSouls: maybe their brain is on 300 ping
[1:18:04] Deathspate: You know, when I saw how much promotion Riot was doing for Arcane I was kinda sus because I didn't think it could be anything but average, but damn their marketing actually seems worth it now, that show deserves eyes
[1:18:18] garry_leonard: trundle should have some down
[1:18:22] Flashkiller__: Flashkiller__ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 61 months!

[1:18:42] W_Tile: D:
[1:18:47] Joitch: F
[1:18:53] Joitch: Your heal was almost up too
[1:18:55] JeXus1985: maybe couldve won that, but it'd been close I think
[1:18:58] JeXus1985: good call
[1:19:05] Deathspate: @LuckyNumber I saw the stuff from Reddit, I didn't see any IRL
[1:19:21] Darkaros: would've been good content to attempt the 1v1 and rage when zyra arrives to help but misses root
[1:19:23] Nogardknight: yeah, I barely knew arcane was coming until the past week or so
[1:19:25] Joitch: She ulted once when she got 6
[1:19:33] garry_leonard: When jinx hit 6 they sent ult up top. It should be back now
[1:19:33] Joitch: Trying to snipe a kill mid
[1:20:01] pa_TIENce: did they use heal?
[1:20:07] HahaHazer: JP used it
[1:20:24] Deathspate: CD optimization Pog
[1:20:54] Jiinglle: Who is supporting Jinx?
[1:20:55] Rodwolt: Jp's getting really good with this ults
[1:21:01] DyingEros: TRUNDLEDOWNBIM
[1:21:01] garry_leonard: trundle has poor map awareness
[1:21:02] Jiinglle: As in Champ
[1:21:08] JeXus1985: that ult was on point
[1:21:12] Darkaros: 2 vs 2 is a fine trade, trundle is uhh.... silly tho
[1:21:16] johnfive21: Rell WtfJingle
[1:21:18] ToppHat: @WtfJingle Rell
[1:21:20] HahaHazer: Zyra playing 2 days in the past, go easy on them PepeHands
[1:21:28] Whiskeydog23: zyra 1v2 while you went to help trundle at the start
[1:21:37] garry_leonard: That's the 2nd fight that trundle was inches away from that they didn't join. When they could have turned the fight.
[1:21:43] Deathspate: I like that xerath skin, makes him look like not another recolor
[1:21:56] Jiinglle: johnfive21 ToppHat Ahh okay havent played since the tentacle guy, thanks bawkLove
[1:22:04] epicshoo: ijpONO it speaks
[1:22:05] ToppHat: 👍
[1:22:08] zinkmanne: damn, and trundle jg is all about the macro game
[1:22:40] Joitch: You should swap to blue trinket next back so you dont haveto facecheck
[1:22:42] Deathspate: I don't know about macro with Trundle, I just like to slap things hard with my big stick and bite towers
[1:22:49] STNbond: watched the Arcane show and knowing nothing about LoL it was really good
[1:23:14] Boonia: if zyra hits a root jinx dies
[1:23:24] epicshoo: big if
[1:23:32] oaktree3: flash
[1:23:34] Deathspate: Flash gone from Rell is big tho

[1:26:18] Deathspate: Uhhh, you had vision of her the whole time lol, not sure why you didn't back off earlier
[1:26:32] MostlyHype: has jp expressed any interest in climbing/ watching educational stuff on his lane?
[1:26:45] grubvox: Jp, is this game easier than Dota?
[1:26:46] Razzyingraz: xerath is such an abuser lol
[1:27:15] pa_TIENce: it's a different game
[1:27:30] pa_TIENce: ok this Gwen is gonna carry this game
[1:27:31] johnfive21: different game, different challenges
[1:27:32] HahaHazer: Some skills transfer over but you still need game knowledge
[1:27:33] Joitch: Top is also doing well i think
[1:27:34] prrrah123: easier to get it but both harder to master
[1:27:35] Jukettaja: It's easier to learn
[1:27:37] grubvox: i want to give it a try, but don't want to re learn an entire game D:
[1:27:44] Altair900: ijpTOTSUGEKI 󠀀
[1:27:49] Twizzlar: over 150 champs, I don't know how knew players deal w/ that
[1:27:50] JeXus1985: learning curve is a bit gentler for League I'd say, but that's about it
[1:27:52] zynessa: @grubvox if you have MOBA experience elsewhere, you'll be fine
[1:27:53] ReginaldXIV: They railroad you harder in LoL than in Dota 2. For good and bad
[1:27:53] Gat0rCh0mp: In a 5v5 game its hard to say something is easier or harder, cause its literally going against 5 people that determine how hard your match is
[1:27:54] Twizzlar: new*
[1:27:56] Darkaros: Dota and LoL are so insanely different nowadays, Dota's just diverged massively in the last 2-3 years
[1:28:04] Draconis_Maximus: what was your rank in dota
[1:28:08] Nogardknight: there's so many champions now that the knowledge barrier is pretty huge
[1:28:08] Sonatta: League is as easy to learn as any MOBA
[1:28:10] Deathspate: Different games that emphasize different skillsets, example Dota has a deny mechanic, LoL doesn't so you deny through other means like lane pressure and positioning etc
[1:28:14] JeXus1985: dota has denying creeps, which made it significantly harder for me
[1:28:14] Darkaros: random items and agh shards giving everyone 6 abilities and 5 goddamn couriers etc
[1:28:20] ToppHat: league moves faster
[1:28:27] Jukettaja: I suppose it's about the same then.

[1:28:43] MartymusPrime95: In league you can surrender NotLikeThis
[1:28:52] Darkaros: and in Dota you can pause stripFufu
[1:28:56] Jukettaja: I just remember Dota 2 feeling like studying even though I had played Dota back in the day
[1:29:02] oaktree3: u guys left trundle
[1:29:08] MILESkg21: WHAT LUL

[1:29:18] epicshoo: what.
[1:29:18] HahaHazer: I guess
[1:29:22] JeXus1985: Think she has that item that deals more damage to towers when alone?
[1:29:28] Deathspate: @Darkaros You can pause in LoL too, just afk in fountain and since you're no longer playing that game is no longer your problem LUL
[1:29:28] HahaHazer: and rift was less efficient
[1:29:32] ZeroDjinn: if she's shoving side lane they need you on the other side of the map for counter pressure
[1:29:41] SaucyCEF: Wanted you to create pressure somewhere else so if they all came mid they'd lose something somewhere else
[1:29:42] CruxAustralis: yes she is trying to split push
[1:29:48] dunnajd: An uncontested herald can take 2 towers.
[1:29:51] MartymusPrime95: @Darkaros ijpD
[1:30:02] CruxAustralis: @dunnajd an uncontested herald can take inhib even
[1:30:03] boki_86: is the game really as toxic as people say?
[1:30:08] CruxAustralis: @boki_86 more
[1:30:09] Archangel3003: It is kind of annoying if you're doing well in your lane then someone on your team comes and starts lingering and then 2 of them show up and you end up dying
[1:30:10] Nogardknight: questionable engage
[1:30:13] Jukettaja: It can be
[1:30:16] MILESkg21: boki_86 its worse LUL
[1:30:16] johnfive21: yes boki_86 but not more than other multiplayer games
[1:30:17] zynessa: Can we just take a moment to acknowledge how absurd it is to complain about new people in silver?

[1:32:00] Mill0u: not even close

[1:32:05] Twizzlar: she just had to take a smoke break to deal w/ the stress
[1:32:11] DyingEros: Def the most toxic game and its not even close
[1:32:13] boki_86: @Mill0u worse than DOTA?
[1:32:18] ReginaldXIV: @Mill0u CS:GO
[1:32:20] MartymusPrime95: Try playing with 4 viewers?? so it cant happen??
[1:32:37] ladderoat: saying "yall new??" when your in silver 4 is not the own you think it is lmao
[1:32:39] Darkaros: That's how JP loses 4 viewers forever and turns off the stream ^^
[1:32:40] STNbond: no MartymusPrime95, just no

[1:54:30] DrJund: Guccvi Bukkake, what a name
[1:54:33] epicshoo: your team already gets halved with amumu's ult
[1:54:40] gigamesh00: TF in silver huh.
[1:54:40] Deathspate: @eLMaQ that's norm actually
[1:54:41] Jiinglle: FeelsBadMan @Darkaros okay
[1:54:45] Gat0rCh0mp: The fiddle should win a jungle fight at least with that ignite.. not much else
[1:55:05] flyerman102: What app is he using?
[1:55:13] Darkaros: Blitz App
[1:55:15] nightsreach: does veigar still one-shot squishies if not dealt with?
[1:55:23] m3rcer: the true League experience
[1:55:28] zinkmanne: yeah but now he can't ult>flash, not a great trade off imo
[1:55:34] epicshoo: a-are you still doing the mind games? monkaS
[1:55:50] JeXus1985: Dark harvest proc ready to go
[1:55:53] Gat0rCh0mp: Thats her run she is gonna collect power basically
[1:55:54] ZeroDjinn: that means that rune is ready to be used
[1:55:58] Gat0rCh0mp: rune*
[1:56:00] AndyMillz: Veigar scales infinitely
[1:56:00] Deathspate: Pretty sure back when I was spamming fiddle and checking all the builds on fidd mains, this was a recommended build, it's common in high elo @zinkmanne
[1:56:12] Deathspate: Although this ain't high elo LUL
[1:56:23] HahaHazer: Viegar late game will just one shot you if he is in range
[1:56:41] epicshoo: monkaSTEER
[1:56:47] airyimbin: Just silver things
[1:56:50] UAjech: you're leashing for way too long
[1:56:55] zinkmanne: oh I like that seraphine skin
[1:56:58] Z3r0Fear: is the damage higher in league or dota?
[1:56:59] sotasty_: Did you like Lost Ark Jp?
[1:57:05] InkBlotTest: I didn't know Reaper was in this game
[1:57:08] Deathspate: Those creeps were gone, you leashed too much
[1:57:08] AndyMillz: You normally don’t want to stay that long tbh… you missed some exp and CS but I’ll not backseat
[1:57:09] HahaHazer: Lucian is like the Yasuo of ADCs for me
[1:57:17] HahaHazer: super try hards play him
[1:57:28] anshavy: i like playing as lux, but not with her =/
[1:57:31] Deathspate: 3 cs Pog
[1:57:39] Darkaros: @sotasty_ he did, he'll check it out on launch if there's not competing games he wants to play over it
[1:57:41] Huffshee: @xCookieHaze oh i through you were gonna say cause he gets to many skins or something :D
[1:57:53] Darkaros: !backseat
[1:57:54] itmeBOT: JP might not read or respond to everything, but he is happy to get non-spoilery, respectful advice on games. Keep in mind, any backseating that is linked to the story of the game ( do X to get Y outcome) is prohibited. ijpLOVE
[1:57:55] sotasty_: ok thanks @Darkaros ! PrideUwu
[1:57:56] 14neo: chat i have an incredibly original low ELO question for you
[1:58:08] AndyMillz: Nice cannon Kappa
[1:58:08] JeperoJ: you should go a bit earlier, i think 3 or 4 autos is how long you leash of the top of my head
[1:58:21] Darkaros: JP's played Dota so his mechanics are probably good enough that "missed CS" is just annoying rather than helpful ijpSIP
[1:58:22] 14neo: why do the ADC and 'support' go up against each other? why doesn't one ADC duo go bottom, and the other one go top? monkaHmm
[1:58:38] SaucyCEF: That used to be a thing, 14neo
[1:58:41] HahaHazer: they can 14neo and they used to
[1:58:50] Darkaros: 14neo unlike Dota where the map's symmetrically balanced, the map is mirrored. The two bot towers are tankier than top IIRC as the explanation
[1:58:52] pandalisk9: seraphine is out of mana at least with all the harass spam
[1:58:57] Deathspate: @14neo this was a thing in the past, still seen now and then, but only in pro
[1:59:00] AndyMillz: @14neo bc you want 2 people close to drag since it’s the main obj on map
[1:59:16] 1TrueTyrant: @14neo Because you can chase them and catch up in xp
[1:59:19] HahaHazer: it changed the laning phase but its not as efficient in the long run
[1:59:26] 14neo: oh, i see, ty for the helpful answers ijp7 @SaucyCEF @xCookieHaze @Darkaros @Deathspate @AndyMillz @1TrueTyrant
[1:59:28] hirtza1: @Darkaros the other way around
[1:59:34] AndyMillz: If rift was more useful then there would be 2 top
[1:59:39] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[1:59:39] Z3r0Fear: @14neo I ran into it last month and got destroyed and really just taking a long break after that happening
[1:59:46] Darkaros: ahh hirtza1 PepoG
[1:59:56] Xinder88: I forget. Do you lose gold upon death in league?
[1:59:58] AndyMillz: All in
[1:59:59] AndyMillz: KEKW
[2:00:04] Deathspate: KEKW
[2:00:05] 1TrueTyrant: @14neo So there isnt much of an advantage doing that anymore, although you used to be able before and it would become a mindgame of where the botlane is going
[2:00:08] SaucyCEF: Back when the trade was popular was also popular when top laners were tanks, therefor not really needing to be super dependent on farming and can take the loss of having to sit back 14neo
[2:00:37] Gat0rCh0mp: FIDD
[2:00:39] SaucyCEF: Different metas, different playstyles
[2:00:46] Z3r0Fear: I learned recently that nobody jungles in DOTA anymore and its just gone back to 2 top 1 mid 2 bottom.
[2:00:48] Neomaddy: hate to see the empty mana from E spam. classic newbie trap
[2:00:48] Gat0rCh0mp: You are supposed to jget rid of the plant so he cant do that Fiddle............
[2:00:52] 14neo: @1TrueTyrant @SaucyCEF interesting monkaHmm
[2:00:55] pfizzle23: is cohh not apart of droppedframes anymore?
[2:01:01] Deathspate: @AndyMillz Rift is arguably very useful, in Worlds every top team fought like their lives depended on Herald, they legit tossed Drags for Herald
[2:01:01] Gat0rCh0mp: Fiddle just let that guy walk by him and use the plant wow
[2:01:04] Marc326: !cohh
[2:01:04] itmeBOT: CohhCarnage is a co-host of Dropped Frames and was a cast member on Rollplay: Balance of Power (Light Side). He is a full time Twitch streamer and community manager playing a variety of games. He’s known for his enthusiasm, positivity and respectful community, the Cohhilition. twitch.tv/CohhCarnage, twitter.com/cohhcarnage BCWarrior
[2:01:14] Darkaros: pfizzle23 He was with the Dropped Frames crew last week for fishing LUL
[2:01:16] Miros__: @pfizzle23 Cohh's 3rd child > DF, for now
[2:01:17] Darkaros: !dfcohh
[2:01:17] itmeBOT: Cohh will return to Dropped Frames proper on the 3rd week of November.
[2:01:35] pfizzle23: oh okat thx for the update
[2:01:37] Marc326: oh !dfcohh that's the one
[2:02:04] pfizzle23: is LoL worth playing anymore? I havent played in years and I'm not sure
[2:02:07] Destac: you miss 100% of the shots you don't take man
[2:02:08] epicshoo: she's totally zoning them PepegaPls
[2:02:16] hirtza1: tf??
[2:02:17] Jiinglle: CrungoSpin
[2:02:27] Igneous_Ghost: Cohh took a couple months off to take care of his child and didn't want to potentially leave for extended periods in a podcast if something with said child came up during DF
[2:02:28] Deathspate: @pfizzle23 There's no really "bad" time to play as the playerbase is somehow always increasing
[2:02:35] Sinnethx: no she throw spell ..to they know he as not have that spell
[2:02:50] KiDtaztic: @pfizzle23 its just a personal choice, things change, some stay the same
[2:02:52] crawds: @pfizzle23  i found aram always worht coming back too because its less toxic
[2:03:01] bakacatt: if you don't kill enemies carry using ult 70% not take Mf it if how to translate it into Dota if you see 4 melee heroes and take Faceless Void :(
[2:03:06] pfizzle23: Soo much has Changed with LoL just don't know if I should get back into it
[2:03:17] SaucyCEF: Lux's gold generation item triggers when she hits them with an ability or auto attack, so probably for that
[2:03:26] KiDtaztic: @pfizzle23 its not hard to pick back up imo
[2:03:40] Deathspate: @pfizzle23 well it's a free game, try it and see if you still like something about it, if you don't just uninstall
[2:03:55] epicshoo: POGGERS
[2:04:06] pfizzle23: okay yeah i may give it a try, a lot has changed since I last played
[2:04:17] Jiinglle: pfizzle23 same for me but all i can remember is the salt in solo q
[2:04:20] Igneous_Ghost: It'll take some getting used to depending on when you left, but I'd say it won't be too hard to get back into things. The game is always changing so unless you've been playing the game CONSTANTLY, there's always gonna be something new to learn
[2:04:26] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[2:04:28] epicshoo: nah gotta throw out some more Q's YEP
[2:04:29] HahaHazer: It will definitely be hard to relearn but thats always part of the game pfizzle23
[2:04:31] ySireAwe: I'm so excited for MCU crew tomorrow!!!! I convinced an iron friend to come listen! bronzeYUH bronzeHUZZAH
[2:04:31] KiDtaztic: @WtfJingle still there
[2:04:41] ySireAwe: *irl friend
[2:04:46] Zsar_Nicholai: Instructions unclear, my mana is all gone now.
[2:04:47] Igneous_Ghost: and yeah things like ARAM or games with friends help a lot with ealing with the playerbase's toxicity
[2:04:56] Gat0rCh0mp: he out of mana atm
[2:04:59] Jiinglle: KiDtaztic legit any game that had online LUL
[2:04:59] Darkaros: nice PlatonicSireAwe ! Hope they'll enjoy the incoming Eternals discussion
[2:05:06] Xinder88: Fiddle still hasn't tried to come bot at all to slow down lucian either
[2:05:07] HahaHazer: Lucian is always a bully
[2:05:11] KiDtaztic: @WtfJingle thats what I tell ppl
[2:05:19] Xinder88: Is that because lucian is too leveled?
[2:05:19] permapensive: nice ult LUL
[2:05:24] 14neo: @PlatonicSireAwe nice, now we just gotta wait for someone to do an embarrassing goof that'll make your friend question their friendship PepeLaugh
[2:05:32] icawn_: I think she was trying for a dark harvest stack
[2:05:33] ySireAwe: @darkaros yep! that's what we want! all that deep marvel comics insight
[2:05:38] epicshoo: is she high?
[2:05:39] KiDtaztic: lux is inting
[2:05:43] PaxterRedwyne: Lux is straight up running it
[2:05:48] permapensive: the inting has begun
[2:05:57] 1TrueTyrant: ok lux is actually inting LUL
[2:06:01] ySireAwe: @14neo the closest friends are the ones who love goofs  dayKrablarRoll bronzeYUH coxJam
[2:06:02] Jiinglle: KiDtaztic Have a missus and kid now since the last i played it so it hard to get back into this game since by degen uni days FeelsBadMan
[2:06:05] hirtza1: let the salt flow
[2:06:11] Deathspate: PJSalt
[2:06:14] HahaHazer: yeah and not, lucian bullies lan cuz of his passive and mobility @Xinder88 which in turn makes it easy to out level
[2:06:25] Igneous_Ghost: Wait... is lux going omnistone? Is that even good on lux?
[2:06:25] 14neo: @PlatonicSireAwe fair point, hope you fellas enjoy the show - i tend to not be able to tune in since spoilerinoes ijp7
[2:06:34] ySireAwe: lleague and wtfs. name a more iconic combo
[2:06:34] Deathspate: Why doesn't JP have the monochrome filter on LUL
[2:06:38] epicshoo: CC'd for days OMEGALUL
[2:06:39] KiDtaztic: @WtfJingle if I have a bad day, I take it out on LoL
[2:06:40] Xinder88: It's funny to see JP having to save his support instead of the other way around
[2:06:41] ySireAwe: @14neo dayKrablarRoll
[2:06:46] Gat0rCh0mp: Thats not salt... if you saw someone chug a bottle of ketchup you would ask the same question.. its just confusion on their decisions
[2:06:49] pfizzle23: thx for answering my questions guys
[2:07:03] Jiinglle: KiDtaztic i do it on PoE KEKW
[2:07:07] crawds: executes is just a free ride home in this game tho
[2:07:10] KiDtaztic: its hard to climb adc tbh
[2:07:10] GamerIsTheNamer: I love how every game of league is always so toxic, no matter how good or bad you are
[2:07:17] 1TrueTyrant: Oh Fiddle doesnt show up at all early to mid game in lower elos, they just farm their life away
[2:07:31] KiDtaztic: @GamerIsTheNamer not every game
[2:07:35] Whiskeydog23: flame horizon
[2:07:47] Jiinglle: mapvision modCheck
[2:07:51] bakacatt: if you don't kill enemies carry using ult 70% not take Mf it if how to translate it into Dota if you see 4 melee heroes and take Faceless Void
[2:07:53] Famaaall: is he legit flaming his team as adc in silver 4?
[2:08:00] league_of_feels: @KiDtaztic Depends on your skill.
[2:08:05] KiDtaztic: tbh the best thing you can do is just mute everyone and play your game
[2:08:11] Deathspate: ngl, I don't really see much toxicity in my game, not sure why but I just don't, then again no one really speaks
[2:08:15] hirtza1: KEKW
[2:08:25] Jiinglle: Sam.. Strippen modCheck help modCheck
[2:08:26] Dark3Nesz: all chat is gone @Deathspate KEKW

[2:08:42] m3rcer: KEKW
[2:08:43] Darkaros: All chat is still here, Sam Strippin got barked at last night after being called a dog.
[2:08:44] Deathspate: @Dark3Nesz I'm talking about in general not recently
[2:08:45] Z3r0Fear: bingo lol
[2:08:49] 1TrueTyrant: Bingo
[2:08:49] KiDtaztic: you can play Lux support tho
[2:08:51] bakacatt: you miss ult not teame
[2:08:51] KiDtaztic: it works
[2:08:57] pa_TIENce: Got autofill support
[2:08:57] bakacatt: ")
[2:08:59] Xinder88: But they're not building support things @KiDtaztic
[2:09:06] MrZiggz: the classic Lux "support"
[2:09:08] PaxterRedwyne: Lux is the classic autofill support lol
[2:09:08] flyerman102: Luz with the big brain plays
[2:09:10] Archangel3003: I find that's most mage "supports" in games these days
[2:09:10] Gat0rCh0mp: Well she got solo'd by a Seraphine support so mid probably wouldnt of gone well
[2:09:17] KiDtaztic: @Xinder88 yeah shes an idiot
[2:09:24] Jiinglle: Darkaros wait what??
[2:09:29] bakacatt: not take mf
[2:09:34] 1TrueTyrant: In fact the Zyra was the same, shes a mid player so she chose a support that does damage so he doesnt suport LUL
[2:09:40] KiDtaztic: lux support is OP in the right hands
[2:09:42] Nurama: the other classic not support supports are zyra, brand, and velkoz. :D
[2:09:47] Deathspate: All chat is only gone in select regions for testing
[2:09:56] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[2:10:12] crawds: did the big seasonal patch already happened?

[2:10:20] Gat0rCh0mp: LMAO
[2:10:24] Z3r0Fear: LMAO
[2:10:25] epicshoo: she literally missed a rooted enemy

[2:10:33] Huffshee: LUL that R
[2:10:36] pa_TIENce: LuL
[2:10:37] Deathspate: @Imaacutiepie I mean less of something bad doesn't make it not bad regardless
[2:10:45] AtomJar: she was trying to get it between them right?
[2:10:46] Darkaros: @WtfJingle https://twitter.com/Strippin/status/1457236602808307712
[2:10:52] Gat0rCh0mp: Lucian killed himself at least, he had no reason walking back up into turret range
[2:11:16] Igneous_Ghost: that Lux just thought the enemies had 100% tenacity
[2:11:16] Deathspate: Lucian cosplaying Jayce, walking to the edge KEKW
[2:11:18] Nurama: True
[2:11:20] KiDtaztic: @Gat0rCh0mp lucians are usually greedy
[2:11:22] permapensive: that ult is really the best warning shot tbh
[2:11:28] Gat0rCh0mp: nah she is out
[2:11:30] Nurama: She might be out
[2:11:30] epicshoo: PauseChamp
[2:11:31] KiDtaztic: shes fine
[2:11:39] 1TrueTyrant: Shes good
[2:11:43] Gat0rCh0mp: Camille mobility too good
[2:11:44] Deathspate: She has hooks, she fine
[2:11:45] peinen: LUL the amount of times you say your dead, and live, or one of your teammates are dead and they live is funny
[2:11:56] KiDtaztic: Camille is smurfin
[2:12:03] Deathspate: Camille is dead he said KEKW
[2:12:12] Razayken: I think she's just using spells to build up her tear.
[2:12:33] LucifersEyes: is the boy jp going for gold by the end?
[2:12:35] Gat0rCh0mp: alexiaFail
[2:12:40] AtomJar: man

[2:14:05] Deathspate: @SinkingWings in most regions yeah
[2:14:09] KiDtaztic: Camil has ult, she wanted to team up real quick
[2:14:10] Igneous_Ghost: I think it's still up in the US. I wouldn't know since I just turned it off myself
[2:14:10] hirtza1: they won't remove all chat after seeing noone wants it removed
[2:14:15] epicshoo: we're winning but also not monkaHmm
[2:14:18] SinkingWings: hope they dont go thru with taken it away
[2:14:25] hirtza1: they're just "testing" cos after they said they'll do it they can't just back out right away
[2:14:31] Gat0rCh0mp: The lucian is powerful but makes bad teamfight decisions so rn they might be okay
[2:14:32] bakacatt: see 0 point take mf hi need 2-3 aoe ult in help o kill enmy
[2:14:34] Sinnethx: she wantes instant base quick
[2:14:46] pa_TIENce: In silver, you only win when you kill the nexus
[2:14:49] hirtza1: so they'll have to get "test results" to make it seem like it's their idea that they shouldn't remove it
[2:14:56] epicshoo: she'll die instead
[2:15:13] Darkaros: @bakacatt Who should JP play instead of MF when he's rolepicked the ADC and is comfortable with only MF and Trist? You don't make sense.
[2:15:16] KiDtaztic: @pa_TIENce not true
[2:15:18] crawds: these red cards
[2:15:19] Cixah: are you just olo queing JP?
[2:15:24] nakata545: @pa_TIENce nah. you win when you tilt an opposing player off the planet

[2:18:50] obscuredvey: there were survivors, all is good
[2:19:00] Igneous_Ghost: tbf, I think the massive marketing push for Arcane is gonna be worth it. The series itself is really good and will probably bring a lot of players back into league or even some new players.
[2:19:04] epicshoo: COPIUM we might win
[2:19:08] Xinder88: 1300 dmg from one veigar spell
[2:19:15] Igneous_Ghost: Just veigar things
[2:19:16] epicshoo: i think you guys are boned late game
[2:19:20] crawds: 1 piece of MR gear would be huge against him
[2:19:20] ExoGinos: is the timers on the map normal now?
[2:19:21] KiDtaztic: Vieg had a free lane too
[2:19:24] ObeyTheEgg: ult
[2:19:38] Deathspate: If the quality of Arcane Act 1 holds up for the rest, I think any amount of marketting is justified
[2:19:38] Igneous_Ghost: Pretty sure the timers are because of blitz
[2:19:40] Catzumo: @Mavros005 no its from blitz app
[2:19:47] Sinnethx: @Mavros005 no its doing blitz app
[2:19:49] nakata545: veigar should be one shotting with any skill soon anyways
[2:20:05] NiBl22: 0 push with baron...
[2:20:33] KiDtaztic: team is playing weird, so idle
[2:20:49] Karamor: veigar got deathcap yet?
[2:20:54] Gat0rCh0mp: just stall
[2:20:56] Gat0rCh0mp: for camille
[2:21:04] Igneous_Ghost: yeah, someone split pushing bot wouldn't be a bad idea. But Camille splitting top is fine as well

[2:29:40] Karamor: not if veigar catches you
[2:29:41] Igneous_Ghost: how close is your team to soul?
[2:29:51] Levyathin: I'd honestly get qss

[2:32:06] ZeroDjinn: AFTER
[2:32:09] epicshoo: it's almost like Cleanse but in an item
[2:32:10] FnC_Sunshine: QSS is a "get out of crowd control free" button in the form of MR

[2:37:58] MrZiggz: @Gat0rCh0mp excellent performance
[2:38:07] Gat0rCh0mp: @MrZiggz KEKW it probably wasnt even that high
[2:38:16] KiDtaztic: not every league game is bad, just some more than others
[2:38:18] MartymusPrime95: Dmg?
[2:38:28] nakata545: They built a lot of armor
[2:38:29] jeffhunter12: holy hell

[2:38:45] MrZiggz: easier to have high damage when you do AOE
[2:38:52] KiDtaztic: they didnt build MR, and she buff, Lux IS a free win
[2:39:00] Trample11: You ever tried TFT JP or you not into the whole auto chess thing?
[2:39:09] boki_86: how long does it take to unlock champs in this game?
[2:39:14] Twizzlar: make a runepage
[2:39:19] johnfive21: are we still gonna watch the cinematics today? ijpHMM
[2:39:24] hirtza1: yes buy the items u want in game lol

[2:39:27] 1TrueTyrant: I think you can
[2:39:27] GoomyGod: Watch some cinematics?
[2:39:30] epicshoo: maybe when JP eats
[2:39:38] Catzumo: @itmejp you can make your own build path in the league client
[2:39:39] ghostlightning527: gotta go to item page
[2:39:42] Draconis_Maximus: some of these league viewers
[2:39:43] 1TrueTyrant: Its been a while since Ive done it but I think you can
[2:39:44] Cosmin8103: yes, you can make a runepage
[2:39:46] Draconis_Maximus: lol
[2:39:56] boki_86: how long does it take to unlock heroes in this game?
[2:40:12] wagah: wtf is yuumi

[2:40:19] Darkaros: a cat
[2:40:21] KiDtaztic: are you done with Lost Ark beta?
[2:40:28] jmanrme: @itmeJP if you go to collection theres an item page to make pre set item builds if thats what you're looking for
[2:40:33] teffy42: you and me :)
[2:40:33] epicshoo: they mfing serious KEKLEO

[2:40:35] bren92: Xayah time
[2:40:35] Marc326: KEKW
[2:40:41] Deathspate: KEKW
[2:40:42] wagah: i feel so old i know all the old school people
[2:40:44] bearonvonbear: Trist time tomatoPog
[2:40:54] wagah: but yummi, kayn no idea
[2:40:59] boki_86: are even all heroes viable?
[2:41:02] KiDtaztic: ashe is my go to, then MF
[2:41:12] Sinfidel: I want the best for this Blitz. Hope they go off.
[2:41:14] Hyluhnduh: blitzcrank hype
[2:41:21] Deathspate: @boki_86 I would say 95% of them are, there are some bad ones tho
[2:41:23] Darkaros: Oh ya, JP's played some Ashe. JP only likes Ashe with teamwork tho (aka w/ Sam)
[2:41:27] Maklen5050: trist usually goes kraken
[2:41:30] epicshoo: MrDestructoid
[2:41:31] wagah: cool to see alot of the old school  champs are good and still used
[2:41:32] leaback: oof rough game for adc this game
[2:41:35] minorcase: yeah don't need galeforce that much if you have a jump
[2:41:51] teffy42: Blitz is either a godfister or completely useless
[2:41:55] KiDtaztic: unrank is always scary, they good or bad
[2:42:01] Gat0rCh0mp: smurfs COPIUM
[2:42:01] ghostlightning527: @boki_86 you get a champion shard every  time you level and it gets you a shard of a champion that allows you to buy the champion permanently
[2:42:08] Deathspate: @wagah old school tend to be stronger because simpler kits mean easier to execute and more power dedicated to a single skill
[2:42:10] epicshoo: MYAAA
[2:42:17] mexican_computer: PauseChamp
[2:42:27] eLMaQ: if Blitz hit some hooks, it can be easy lane
[2:42:47] epicshoo: "more power dedicated" OMEGALUL
[2:42:49] Daikurou: and then make tthem an anime girl
[2:42:49] KiDtaztic: Vex is worse
[2:42:59] hirtza1: kayn is like 4 years old
[2:43:05] Vladan997: aww the blitzcrank skin
[2:43:06] Deathspate: I give you TF, champ seems weak but is insanely powerful
[2:43:11] Twizzlar: f zoe,
[2:43:15] Maklen5050: thats zoe
[2:43:17] johnfive21: yup
[2:43:19] Sonnung: That's not recent. Haha. They've always done that.
[2:43:22] spellslinger55: she teleporty
[2:43:23] teffy42: that's what Zoe does
[2:43:25] HanazawaRui01: yup, that's what zoe does
[2:43:25] KiDtaztic: Zoey is skill base, but scary af
[2:43:32] minorcase: Zoe is actually super busted on a good player
[2:43:34] Maklen5050: zoey is def top 5 most hated champ
[2:43:38] HanazawaRui01: the farther the zoe skill goes... the more it does dmg
[2:43:40] Twizzlar: bubbles out of nowhere b/c it gets distance through terrain
[2:43:46] Nogardknight: TF is a legacy OP champ, but a reveal and long range teleport will never not be good
[2:44:00] teffy42: I hate her far more for her design than her playstyle lol
[2:44:06] sydneyspencer98: Zoe is legit but she has a pretty high skill floor
[2:44:06] wagah: i remeber when patheon and TF could go anywhere on the amp
[2:44:09] wagah: map with there ult
[2:44:11] KiDtaztic: @Nogardknight Utility is nice but he aint OP
[2:44:17] Maklen5050: yeah, TF on release was global, shit was bustged
[2:44:24] Archangel3003: Yeah you have to fire her Q behind you then R forward and recast Q at the enemy for max distance traveled
[2:44:24] Deathspate: Xin is also another OP old champ, Gragas as well, they're all pretty strong, solo q esp
[2:44:35] Nogardknight: TF was global TP for like 4 years before they finally changed it
[2:44:51] epicshoo: monkaW ghosts
[2:45:08] teffy42: love to see these ancient ass Gragas skins
[2:45:08] wagah: that show arcane was awesome
[2:45:09] Daikurou: man, i want more arcane now Madge
[2:45:12] Nogardknight: just watch the series Kappa
[2:45:13] sydneyspencer98: TIL TF ult is no longer global
[2:45:17] KiDtaztic: @sydneyspencer98 Zoey on a bad player is a 4v5
[2:45:19] ZanninAkkusu: Sounded like Heimerdinger
[2:45:21] Wurth: @sataruyamate, agree
[2:45:25] Rave_Digger: Doesnt help that the lore has always  completely changed on like a 6-month basis
[2:45:27] minorcase: honestly arcane might be the best way to get lore
[2:45:33] Darkaros: to paraphrase Gmart, I miss when Ahri was just a horny fox who wanted to be human Sadge
[2:45:37] MartymusPrime95: Any lore videos on youtube we can watch??
[2:45:38] epicshoo: gragas is a fat man
[2:45:41] Sharkabatu: The card game has a lot of lore interactions that are all cannon
[2:45:49] IkomaTomoya: LoL doesn't have lore as much as character backstories
[2:45:50] Twizzlar: the lore has been much more focused the last few years, they started putting effort into it
[2:45:52] Deathspate: Shurima, Demacia and Noxus lore is great imo
[2:45:54] Daikurou: Necrit on youtube is pretty good lore guy
[2:45:55] TDotTerror: Arcane made me realise a lotta things about Piltover/Zaun.
[2:45:55] wagah: legends of rune terra is fun to play
[2:45:57] KiDtaztic: Sol created the universe and was tamed, sad dragon
[2:46:02] Archangel3003: @itmeJP You should watch the cinematic trailers if you haven't yet. They're pretty cool honestly
[2:46:03] IkomaTomoya: It's a D&D player's discarded character concept collection
[2:46:12] TDotTerror: Things I can't say because spoilers and cussing.
[2:46:12] epicshoo: Lore might be more stable now that they're making content around it?
[2:46:14] Dark3Nesz: the cant smoke ingame but animated series NO PROBLEM LUL
[2:46:18] Gat0rCh0mp: If he is good he should be able to get every cannon for both of you
[2:46:22] sydneyspencer98: @sydneyspencer98 Exactly, I've played with skilled Zoe players that carry hard but usually they don't know the champ and we're basically a teammate down
[2:46:25] Twizzlar: think they started to focus more on it to setup their MMO
[2:46:38] KiDtaztic: thinking about Vi and Jinx fighting gods is funny
[2:46:41] Dark3Nesz: mmo is a rumor but would be awome
[2:46:43] IkomaTomoya: Chat who of you all is fucked whern the LoL MMO comes? Kappa
[2:46:51] Deathspate: Kai is fun, her autoes are so satisfying
[2:47:12] KiDtaztic: kaisa is hit or miss tho
[2:47:28] Gat0rCh0mp: Blitz got it for both of you
[2:47:29] ExoGinos: no
[2:47:31] KiDtaztic: karma is super annoying
[2:47:33] ExoGinos: blitz got it
[2:47:33] MrZiggz: blitz got you the cannon
[2:47:38] nakata545: blitz shared it
[2:47:42] Avision420: bitz got it for you
[2:47:43] m3rcer: he got the support item
[2:47:44] Gat0rCh0mp: Blitz support item can get a minion for both of you on cool down
[2:48:07] KiDtaztic: you're fine....for now
[2:48:11] Twizzlar: @Dark3Nesz they are working on it, it's not a rumor
[2:48:20] Deathspate: I swear, RIot Sirhain is a god, thank god that man is at Riot, he's slowly making the game feels less BS one champ at a time
[2:48:27] ghostlightning527: its yone one kill and hes back into the game
[2:48:43] wagah: top getting rolled
[2:48:47] Huffshee: Poppy PepeHands
[2:48:47] KiDtaztic: mmo bringing some dude from WoW, its legit, going to take like  6-7 yrs
[2:48:56] Nurama: @ghostlightning527 not even, if he makes it to two items hes back in the game
[2:49:02] Gat0rCh0mp: He gets it for both of you JP
[2:49:09] Gat0rCh0mp: hes not stealing it
[2:49:36] Maklen5050: playing pretty passive for blitz. blitz trist is a kill lane. grab -> jump is almost always dead
[2:49:45] epicshoo: he doesn't have much presence otherwise
[2:49:58] nakata545: blitz is definitely playind scared
[2:50:01] epicshoo: he needs to grab something
[2:50:08] Maklen5050: not using mana, you have to make the threat of a grab, even if you dont take it
[2:50:08] nakata545: he can absolutely just walk up and threaten
[2:50:10] Gat0rCh0mp: He should just walk up and E her
[2:50:15] Maklen5050: walk up and scare them is what he should be doing
[2:50:18] Twizzlar: he doesn't even need to use his hook, just be there to threaten it
[2:50:21] KiDtaztic: passive supports are so annoying to me
[2:50:31] arrowdeath4: can't hook, what if he fails?
[2:50:33] FredIsBread: hes big chillin
[2:50:40] Nogardknight: like why be blitz if you're not gonna hook?  LUL
[2:50:41] ligmajohnsonson: best to hook now lol so much creeps
[2:50:46] ligmajohnsonson: well rip
[2:50:50] Maklen5050: now the save is in a terrible state
[2:50:52] epicshoo: best lead up ever
[2:50:52] MrZiggz: maybe he's feeling out your ability
[2:50:52] Maklen5050: wave*
[2:50:54] Avision420: he could have hooked there\
[2:51:00] KiDtaztic: @arrowdeath4 better to try then do nothing
[2:51:01] ghostlightning527: double ranged bot are hard for a meele champ like blitz, that being said he does miss good hook opportunities
[2:51:02] Twizzlar: had perfect chance to hook the karma into that huge wave
[2:51:04] Gusty331: they play in minions can be hard to hook
[2:51:06] ligmajohnsonson: now he hooks when enemy wave is pushing
[2:51:11] Gat0rCh0mp: Its like he only wants them to push so he can pull them into tower range... but his ADC is a trist so thats never gonna happen
[2:51:38] Nurama: he will come back
[2:51:42] Maklen5050: blitz actually shits on ranged supports, he has so much pressure on them.

[2:52:09] KiDtaztic: nice kill
[2:52:11] ligmajohnsonson: WORTH
[2:52:14] arrowdeath4: but it looked cool
[2:52:14] Gat0rCh0mp: kill secured acieSHRUG
[2:52:15] Maklen5050: see, hook -> jump is basically always a kill unless they early flash
[2:52:17] epicshoo: that was wild
[2:52:18] DocFreezer: blow it all, jimmy
[2:52:18] DoctorWhiteFace: reset tho so it doesnt matter
[2:52:19] Qutini: super nice kill @itmeJP yes u did

[2:52:24] Qutini: ah maybe
[2:52:27] nakata545: probably but trist has W so who cares
[2:52:30] epicshoo: gotta dunk on them
[2:52:30] Qutini: great flash though

[2:55:28] Maklen5050: minions did so much dmg to you there

[2:58:22] Maklen5050: I guess your blitz doesnt even want to play support anymore

[3:15:54] TamboTv: cinematics ?
[3:15:56] Oglok_Pandra: there are ads now in the launcher ?

[3:16:39] Sidewinder3121: where's strippin when you need him
[3:16:43] Eplesh: you picked quite the difficult role to start League with, I respect it @itmeJP
[3:16:44] Nurama: right click block
[3:17:22] Jzimmy15: your in silver
[3:17:23] epicshoo: well you're in silver so highly likely it'll be good

[3:18:15] zynessa: Don't blame the Blitz for your inability to understand his magnificence D:
[3:18:20] Kruptein: did he end up watching any cinematic ?
[3:18:21] wagah: for not be a support
[3:18:23] Ribbons_Almark: ooh xin zhao was my main when I used to play. How is he nowadays?
[3:18:24] Darkaros: Mid gets fought over a lot apparently
[3:18:27] Adept_Zeno: Poor Blitz lol
[3:18:27] Eplesh: midlane is the contested role
[3:18:32] wagah: ok cool
[3:18:34] johnfive21: if you queue mid or top you can get autofilled
[3:18:38] wagah: i might try League again
[3:18:39] johnfive21: bottom not so much
[3:18:58] Solfull: and if you queue jungle instant queues

[3:19:13] ladderoat: ratJAM
[3:19:17] Igneous_Ghost: Role Queue works, but there's always the chance to autofill into another lane.  thankfully, when you play out a game where you're autofilled, you become immune to autofill for a couple of games

[3:21:56] GameLantern: I'd expect more next weekend
[3:21:58] DaddyTopDom: flash for flash, so atleast it was an even trade
[3:22:02] wagah: yay for invis people :(
[3:22:09] personno4: FEED US
[3:22:15] Igneous_Ghost: all the arcane characters are on free week too
[3:22:18] Karamor: arcane premiere was at 3 in the night for europe
[3:22:20] Swerdna: Still build Attack Speed on him?
[3:22:29] Karamor: smart riot
[3:22:34] zynessa: @Karamor they rebroadcasted it at 12 too though
[3:22:59] Karamor: @zynessa fair point, but when you can't see the premiere many people will put it off till they have time
[3:22:59] epicshoo: FeelsRainMan
[3:23:08] Maklen5050: why does JP get such shit supports. I mean Zac???
[3:23:26] Maklen5050: people can't just play lulu, thresh, braum, leona, shit that actually works
[3:23:28] wagah: gah! you bring me back into this toxic wasteland JP! i just want to play now lol
[3:23:39] zynessa: @Karamor yeah, but sadly there's not any time you can put it at that makes sense for more than one place in the world, especially when the fan base is literally global.
[3:23:42] epicshoo: stripSuffer
[3:23:54] Igneous_Ghost: omg I fogot Zac's voice gets pitched up when he's smaller
[3:23:56] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!

[3:24:22] pocatsu: is this stream dropping cases?
[3:24:59] johnfive21: no csgo cases here
[3:25:04] Ribbons_Almark: think Zac would be able to body block that pull at lvl 2 -3?
[3:25:18] pocatsu: yeah dude i was talking abou cs go cases
[3:25:18] Karamor: @zynessa yeah, not sure how it worked for asia, but if I go by twitch viewrship a more western time focus would have been fairer
[3:25:23] Darkaros: We had drops for Arcane but you're about 10 hours late for that
[3:25:34] pocatsu: aw
[3:25:40] pocatsu: ty
[3:25:43] wagah: my drop for arcane was lost ark
[3:25:57] zynessa: @Karamor It was basically early day for asia. Right around 10am ish in China I think?
[3:25:58] Darkaros: peepoGiggles
[3:26:18] Karamor: @zynessa I meant, netflix isn't in china, is it?
[3:26:34] epicshoo: their pyke actually playing like a hook champ unlike blitz KEKLEO
[3:26:57] zynessa: @Karamor Arcane absolutely exists in China, which platform it is through I am not sure though.
[3:27:22] Ribbons_Almark: ...dang

[3:27:44] bairdman: trungle prob isnt best pick here, no tanks on enemy team, and no mobility on his part which temendous mobility on enemy team
[3:27:45] Ribbons_Almark: idk why trundle went in
[3:27:48] Karamor: @zynessa true, so in that case an early morning release was fine. china audience is huge
[3:27:59] NightWolf0027: Jung should have just cleared pink and left
[3:28:02] bairdman: clown fiesta bot lane neffJoker
[3:28:03] Ribbons_Almark: ^

[3:28:14] sapu_123: @itmeJP your hidden MMR is challenger, so you have to expect those plays :D
[3:28:23] zynessa: @Karamor Yeah, it was basically only Europe that got screwed this time around, which makes sense because Europe is probably the smallest of the three major regions LUL
[3:28:24] loveUselesstwitch: urgot vs 4 mele = lose

[3:36:08] Sidewinder3121: I know some people who just never surrender
[3:36:08] KDogg241: egos in silver KEKW
[3:36:10] Jzimmy15: NA has an insanely huge problem where no one values their time and its always winnable. hence the toxicity
[3:36:15] Karamor: there are sadly a ton of "never surrender'" people, apart from the real trolls
[3:36:32] Kaddhy_2k10: it wasn't an ult... that was only W of Kinreds! And ult would not work on u aswell

[3:37:17] bakacatt: if you bay hi not stan you
[3:37:22] Darkaros: !makecommand Arcane JP co-streamed Arcane episode 1 and watched episodes 2 and 3 afterward and enjoyed it a lot! He thought it was the best video game adaptation into a TV show etc so far, over stuff like Castelvania/Dota/Witcher.
[3:37:22] itmeBOT: !arcane ADDED
[3:37:22] Survivor_mkII: this is why its winnable, low elo everything is winnable

[3:46:10] bairdman: someone direct that guy out of left field
[3:46:10] Dawn_Dragon_: Lolz
[3:46:11] ghostlightning527: @Itsjustme90  oh lol i just recently started playing leage a year ago also its a really hard game to get good at lol so i feel you im barely climbing out of silver also
[3:46:11] gh0stdiem: it induces rage for me :p
[3:46:12] JamesOwenThe2nd: LUL veig
[3:46:13] Dawn_Dragon_: never
[3:46:15] nightsreach: rofl
[3:46:15] Nashfanfl13: veigar?
[3:46:16] Noytron: LOL
[3:46:17] Dawn_Dragon_: don't exist
[3:46:19] Karamor: veigar is played as a sup
[3:46:19] sapu_123: @Cixah jp wants to watch trailers and stuff later
[3:46:20] zechetto: veigar sup is good, if he can lay it
[3:46:23] Variandra: @itmeJP vigar support is actually a normal support
[3:46:23] DezartIII: Veigar is good sup
[3:46:28] AKraftyBasterd: thats a big if
[3:46:29] DezartIII: NODDERS
[3:46:31] Darkaros: What did we say about not trying to tilt JP WeirdDude
[3:46:35] ljbrevoord: veigar box stun is 3 seconds long if u max that shit, just sayin
[3:46:36] Itsjustme90: f
[3:46:39] Noytron: where are the seraphine supports amiright ?
[3:46:39] bairdman: !arcane
[3:46:39] itmeBOT: JP co-streamed Arcane episode 1 and watched episodes 2 and 3 afterward and enjoyed it a lot! He thought it was the best video game adaptation into a TV show etc so far, over stuff like Castelvania/Dota/Witcher.
[3:46:39] epicshoo: dodge, just dodge
[3:46:40] sydneyspencer98: One day there's gonna be a Soraka support and I think JP is gonna cry
[3:46:40] sapu_123: :D
[3:46:40] ShinraVet: veigar is ok, well better than zac :D
[3:46:45] Survivor_mkII: tbf at low elo, just having full dmg supp is kinda legit
[3:46:48] Nathanisms: veigars not bad
[3:46:50] DezartIII: Veigar can be a good sup
[3:46:51] personno4: COPIUM NORMAL SUPPORT
[3:46:52] ChiZWorkshop: incoming veigar rage
[3:46:52] RyuSensei: roll with it, lets see how shorty does
[3:46:56] teffy42: I'm more worried about the Teemo
[3:46:59] zechetto: I'm impressed by how fast this game made you this tilted...  LOL
[3:47:02] Dawn_Dragon_: NotLikeThis
[3:47:06] Darkaros: You had a decent Veigar support once
[3:47:09] Itsjustme90: wait, arcane is better than witcher?
[3:47:10] Bakanoodle: it would not be bad if there was no morgana on the other side xD
[3:47:15] Nathanisms: twitch jgl
[3:47:16] johnfive21: twitch jungle
[3:47:19] Nathanisms: graves top
[3:47:21] DaddyTopDom: people dont realize enchanter or engage supports are the way to go
[3:47:21] lordofchaos: i mean cage into  e ult can be spicy
[3:47:22] sapu_123: twitch jungle?
[3:47:27] zechetto: @Itsjustme90 Arcane is fucking goooood
[3:47:27] ZeroDjinn: jungle twitch]
[3:47:30] FullHxD: Maybe you could try playing solo lanes, having to rely on silver support is tilting
[3:47:32] SoulCrusher842: Morgana mid
[3:47:33] Noytron: twitch jungle graves top
[3:47:33] lordofchaos: twitch jungle grave top
[3:47:34] AzureSeishin: Veigar is actually a normal support atm.
[3:47:34] Karamor: @Itsjustme90 only saw the first episode yet, but it's really good
[3:47:34] SoulCrusher842: maybe
[3:47:34] nightsreach: those two teams
[3:47:36] bairdman: say a vid on a korean xayah mid earlier
[3:47:37] epicshoo: hypeE
[3:47:39] nightsreach: lose to a tank
[3:47:39] Nathanisms: @itmeJP Care for the level 2 cheese, he might come invis straight from buff
[3:47:40] nightsreach: lol
[3:47:40] Karamor: twitch jgl graves top, yeah
[3:47:40] Variandra: he was originally a JG
[3:47:43] Nashfanfl13: captain TEEEMO
[3:47:46] personno4: you got a teemo, you've won already KEKW
[3:47:52] bairdman: doubt itll make it to NA
[3:47:55] aircable: any champion that goes invisible is auto win in any role at this elo
[3:48:02] guru_lt: I remembet times when best support was anne
[3:48:03] aircable: people dont buy vision wards
[3:48:03] DaddyTopDom: @itmeJP twitch is all about the cheese in the jungle. he's useless if you play safe the first 8 min of the game
[3:48:05] ljbrevoord: i mean twitch cant jungle, u just invade him on his buffs and hes useless the rest of the game, on low elo peps dont know that so he wreaks havoc
[3:48:09] FullHxD: teemo and yi against 2 silver adc, should be a free one
[3:48:12] Dawn_Dragon_: You just need to find a static support.
[3:48:34] epicshoo: Hmm
[3:48:36] Doomwyte: LUL
[3:48:37] personno4: Pog
[3:48:38] sapu_123: veigar carry Pog

[3:49:28] bairdman: !next @SoulCrusher842
[3:49:28] SoulCrusher842: col
[3:49:31] SoulCrusher842: cool
[3:49:39] Jzimmy15: twitch 1005 will cheese one of the lanes
[3:49:51] epicshoo: oh noo
[3:49:55] Nogardknight: welp
[3:50:10] personno4: it begins
[3:50:15] bairdman: whats with the increase cheese in low elo
[3:50:26] Nogardknight: because people don't know how to deal with cheese at low elo
[3:50:40] Altair900: and the need to get every advantage possible
[3:50:41] DaddyTopDom: @bairdman because it works
[3:50:41] bairdman: i hard a karthus jg camp bot lane bushes for legit 3 minutes
[3:50:43] Karamor: @bairdman it works more than average so it's worth it
[3:50:49] AzureSeishin: low elo is always about cheese. it is when cheese carries.
[3:50:53] Destac: not really cheese, if oyu blow flash at lvl 1 expect a gank really fast
[3:51:08] sapu_123: xaya doesnt know about veigars ability she didnt dodge :D
[3:51:14] DaddyTopDom: @bairdman in low elo, its not cheese, its a legit strat LUL
[3:51:19] bairdman: then he camped the krug bush waiting for me to walk by
[3:51:59] Karamor: at least the don't have much to deal with yi
[3:52:01] Noytron: teemo things
[3:52:02] epicshoo: this game is a rollercoaster monkaSTEER
[3:52:31] sapu_123: @itmeJP what button do you have "attack move" on?
[3:52:38] DaddyTopDom: xayah was tanking 2 waves of minions and lost the trade because of it LUL
[3:52:48] Noytron: if they freeze it D:
[3:52:52] Eyeofthehawks: A lot of people bind A-click to a single button press
[3:53:03] sapu_123: many seem to have attack-move on A, maybe I should switch. am on T right now
[3:53:06] HumanAres: its pushing
[3:53:09] ljbrevoord: nah it pushes back
[3:53:10] HumanAres: towards you
[3:53:27] DaddyTopDom: @sapu_123 doesnt matter, its whatever you are comfortable with
[3:53:32] Noytron: only a pink ward potentially but even that isn't guaranteed to help
[3:53:42] sapu_123: @KrzyKarl right
[3:53:44] Jzimmy15: its ahrd to tell in the moment but they have to have 4 more ranged minions and it be out of tower range to fully freeze the wave
[3:53:44] personno4: maybe riot is trolling you with these games KEKW
[3:53:46] Noytron: LUL
[3:53:53] Ratman9000: monkaS
[3:53:54] Eyeofthehawks: if you saw worth, its always worth
[3:53:56] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:53:57] Eyeofthehawks: say*
[3:54:27] Noytron: massive mid laner support though
[3:54:28] Nathanisms: which pro player has it matched you against for CSing?
[3:54:45] Eyeofthehawks: Another no-tank teamcomp Sadge
[3:54:47] MartymusPrime95: Wow get Jinxed came out 2013....
[3:54:54] Theawesomesoccer2: its me :)
[3:55:02] Ratman9000: bjergsen I think
[3:55:35] Doomwyte: this yi, invading when everyone is MIA LUL
[3:55:49] DezartIII: Not even close
[3:55:59] SoulCrusher842: Only reason to play Veigar support is to passively take farm Kappa
[3:56:40] sapu_123: yi's are overrated :D
[3:56:41] jjonnej: Pog is this a Rekkles alt?
[3:56:43] DezartIII: I remember when veigar's stun didn't have a delay. Those were the days
[3:56:43] Theawesomesoccer2: its yi never count on him until maybe after 20
[3:56:45] ghostlightning527: if veigar lands a stun your r is gonna shred
[3:56:49] Theawesomesoccer2: if the games isnt over by then
[3:57:06] Doomwyte: nice
[3:57:06] HumanAres: nice r

[3:57:08] Cardsharp: Hey Jp and chat
[3:57:09] personno4: niiiice
[3:57:09] RyuSensei: POGGERS
[3:57:10] SaltyClaw: nice
[3:57:11] bairdman: clutch level up
[3:57:11] aircable: people play mages support because they know if they dont and their adc is bad they have no shot at winning
[3:57:11] Darkaros: good timing for the lv6
[3:57:11] Ratman9000: Pog
[3:57:12] sapu_123: nice NODDERS
[3:57:13] NewKvothe: thatis a po
[3:57:14] chippye: good timing

[3:57:21] AnorienNightwish: ijpPOGGERS
[3:57:30] Noytron: calculated
[3:57:31] jjonnej: Yi stole BOTH kills from our superior streamer ijpMAD
[3:57:41] Eyeofthehawks: I always remember taking Lucidity boots on MF, is that bad now? is there a buttload of CDR in the game?
[3:57:42] personno4: 5Head jp planned that
[3:57:47] Survivor_mkII: no pink ward?
[3:57:48] ghostlightning527: its not stealing if he carries
[3:58:12] eLMaQ: bot gank :OOOO
[3:58:24] Karamor: @Eyeofthehawks games ahs become so bursty that you're ven taking armor or mr boots now
[3:58:35] Eyeofthehawks: Sounds fun.
[3:58:35] Slade1760: Slade1760 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months, currently on a 32 month streak!

[3:59:06] Theawesomesoccer2: he almost succeeded at alcove gaming
[3:59:32] Nogardknight: worth
[3:59:42] Karamor: good
[3:59:51] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!

[4:00:15] MarshallOnline: ah adc, what i used to play too. Good ole everyone will always come gank your lane role
[4:00:30] DezartIII: Doesn't let the sup kill the guard FeelsBadMan
[4:00:41] epicshoo: monkaSHAKE
[4:00:43] Darkaros: I think JP's still figuring out what game to play pre-BF, so we might get more League on Mon-Thurs
[4:00:43] DezartIII: ward*
[4:00:51] Nystrianzia: 69 cs. :'(
[4:01:14] DaddyTopDom: 69, nice
[4:01:17] DauntlessPhantom: krugs
[4:01:20] ghostlightning527: twitch might be blue
[4:01:23] sapu_123: veigar should get pink wards
[4:01:31] Variandra: twitch mid
[4:01:31] Catzumo: twitch mid
[4:01:36] epicshoo: POGSLIDE
[4:01:39] Nogardknight: nice pick
[4:02:01] MarshallOnline: should find you a supp buddy to queue with. So much easier to climb in bot lane as a duo tbh.
[4:02:12] ZeroDjinn: thats Sam
[4:02:16] AnorienNightwish: ijpNODDERS
[4:02:18] CruxAustralis: it's like Veigar is a decent support or smth LUL
[4:02:24] DezartIII: LUL
[4:02:31] CruxAustralis: not good but not bad either
[4:02:57] Nogardknight: probably about to timeout
[4:02:59] ljbrevoord: timing out?
[4:03:23] RyuSensei: i about tried to click a skill upgrade arrow lol
[4:03:27] personno4: noice
[4:03:31] Karamor: yi play
[4:03:32] CruxAustralis: Twitch happened
[4:03:55] ZanninAkkusu: There was about three brain cells used in that series of plays by the others lol
[4:04:32] ElSpartin: Sadge poor veiger
[4:04:42] epicshoo: monkaSHAKE
[4:04:48] RyuSensei: save us yi-sus COPIUM
[4:04:50] Infidel_Art: just yi things
[4:04:52] DezartIII: Well played by Yi. Two mechanics well used
[4:04:55] 7_r_3_v_0_r: u got a lot potential to be pretty good at this game itmejp
[4:05:03] Doomwyte: water drake
[4:05:03] epicshoo: ocean drake's tears
[4:05:05] CruxAustralis: ocean drake
[4:05:05] ljbrevoord: ocean
[4:05:06] IkomaTomoya: Because Ocean Drake
[4:05:06] Ratman9000: ocean drag
[4:05:06] DeffsNotErik: ocean drake
[4:05:08] Variandra: ocean drage
[4:05:09] jjonnej: ocean man (drake)
[4:05:21] Kymix: really?
[4:05:23] FullHxD: I mean yi actually used his kit, rare
[4:05:24] Kymix: that is a thing?
[4:05:32] CruxAustralis: ocean drake causes rain, more regen plants and more bushes
[4:05:41] ElSpartin: Vlad at least making it even
[4:05:41] ReginaldXIV: Ocean man, take me by the hand. Lead me to the land that you understand OOOO
[4:05:45] DeffsNotErik: theres also more bushes in the jungle after ocean drake i think
[4:05:46] Karamor: depending on witch drake you take taht will defien soul the map changes
[4:06:22] DezartIII: That flash LUL
[4:06:28] Infidel_Art: gj
[4:06:28] AinzN: Nicely done!
[4:06:29] epicshoo: xayah gettin' real tired of that shit KEKLEO
[4:06:33] DeffsNotErik: flash to assert dominance
[4:06:37] johnfive21: he stayed in range through the root with flash
[4:06:53] Theawesomesoccer2: she was dead 100% vlad was behind
[4:06:55] Darkaros: PepoG TIL different drake types exist now when I played there was only one
[4:06:56] Variandra: it was needed to get close when he knew he was getting rooted
[4:07:04] 7_r_3_v_0_r: fuck vlad
[4:07:05] Nashfanfl13: captain feedmo
[4:07:12] DezartIII: Didn't see the root tbh
[4:07:15] FullHxD: for a silver nothing wrong with the flash
[4:07:15] 7_r_3_v_0_r: dats jps money
[4:07:18] Variandra: @Darkaros they are adding 2 more next season too
[4:07:23] Altair900: ^ was about to say that
[4:07:30] Theawesomesoccer2: chemtech drake oh no no no KEKW
[4:07:57] FullHxD: I dont mind the new drakes but the map changes the drakes bring sound awful
[4:08:02] Theawesomesoccer2: going to be mure busted than elder
[4:08:11] Lindobu: rengar mains sweating at chem drake
[4:08:21] epicshoo: what's she gonna do? die?
[4:08:28] reminkly: to be fair, most everyone hated the idea of the original drakes, and they ended up being really good changes
[4:09:03] Variandra: TBF the original drags were garbo unbalenced
[4:09:11] codywithcats: JP on the "Veigar is good" now train?
[4:09:15] Theawesomesoccer2: @reminkly hextech one is alright but chemtech is just stupid free sion passive for everyone
[4:09:21] epicshoo: OMEGALUL
[4:09:26] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:09:29] reminkly: it's much shorter than sion's passive at least
[4:09:30] ElSpartin: lasted longer than he should have
[4:09:35] FullHxD: is it really "free sion passive" if you have to get the dragon soul to get one
[4:09:37] redyety: god bait
[4:09:37] epicshoo: that bait
[4:09:39] Joebeezer: teemo is the master baiter
[4:09:39] Lindobu: the ultimate bait
[4:09:45] jeffhunter12: veigars doing great
[4:09:49] reminkly: dragon souls should be game swinging imo
[4:09:52] reminkly: it's why everyone hates cloud soul
[4:10:16] reminkly: of the souls it has the least impact. the ulti cdr has more impact from getting individual cloud dragons in most cases
[4:10:17] QteSurface: not everyone hates cloud soul
[4:10:18] Theawesomesoccer2: ye but a soul should not be stronger then elder
[4:10:18] FullHxD: souls should be strong, map changes happen no matter if you get the drakes or not so them being too impactful will be awful
[4:10:42] reminkly: ehh elder gives your team all a massive execute + a ton of stats / push power
[4:10:55] Lindobu: if a soul becomes game swinging it also means it becomes game closing which you don't want
[4:11:05] FullHxD: why not
[4:11:06] epicshoo: Hmm
[4:11:08] reminkly: souls were intended to help close a game out
[4:11:08] jjonnej: deleted
[4:11:09] ElSpartin: veiger nuke very strokn
[4:11:09] QteSurface: which you do* want
[4:11:09] Nurama: just veigar things
[4:11:11] Shoaron: deleted
[4:11:14] codywithcats: lul
[4:11:15] jeffhunter12: ijpHAHA
[4:11:17] Lindobu: that's the elder not the soul
[4:11:21] codywithcats: go Veigar
[4:11:26] Lindobu: the soul buff being permanent is more than plenty imo
[4:11:27] DaddyTopDom: mid support wannabe LUL
[4:11:35] epicshoo: twitch just getting rekt by vlad OMEGALUL
[4:11:37] reminkly: souls are a direct reward of prioritizing the neutral objective over the course of 20+ minutes
[4:11:49] FullHxD: I want souls to be strong enough that the team that holds the soul has big advantage, they literally have the soul
[4:12:10] Variandra: i just want drags to not be solo able
[4:12:18] FullHxD: agreed
[4:12:18] Lindobu: a scaling team will loseout early drakes resutling in a jungler and team going even more behind than they already do
[4:12:21] epicshoo: power move hourglass
[4:12:21] Variandra: its lame AF that ppl can solo them at lvl 6-7
[4:12:26] codywithcats: Being able to blow up LB isn't a "wannabe mid" that is just how Veigar works
[4:12:35] i_revarm: the problem with the souls is that since you dont know which one you're getting you cant draft an effective comp to use it
[4:12:47] Lindobu: if the souls were stronger than they already are the meta would shift drastically not allowing for late game comps at all imho
[4:12:48] i_revarm: also a couple are pretty damn useless
[4:12:59] Nurama: the 2 new souls they are adding are i win buttons so
[4:13:01] Nurama: meh :D
[4:13:06] mokey95: how many stacks veigar?
[4:13:12] Nurama: aoe slow and IM A ZOMBIE SION THAT CAN USE ABILITIES HURR HURR
[4:13:13] reminkly: I believe it was stated they wanted the dragon soul to be totally random to avoid forcing certain metas around specific dragons. It's the opposite of how HotS was
[4:13:16] Lindobu: that's why i like the souls not be TOO big of an impact elder aside
[4:13:18] reminkly: since HotS had metas per map
[4:13:21] epicshoo: you just jinxed it
[4:13:34] Variandra: KS
[4:13:35] LissXIV: Ahaha
[4:13:38] FluentZap: LUL
[4:13:40] jeffhunter12: bikeKreally
[4:13:44] epicshoo: ijpMAD
[4:14:02] Lindobu: yeah imagine knowing it's a earth drake KEKW
[4:14:11] i_revarm: probably, cause riot is riot and their logic never faults to amaze me
