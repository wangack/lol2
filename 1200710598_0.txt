[0:28:39] Mrshilka: NDA is everywhere
[0:28:39] yrvengalied: LUL
[0:28:44] ZigZog: the whole point of NDA is that they want the news to be released all at the same time on every platform
[0:28:45] Heisuisui: its supposed to level the playing field for reviewers
[0:28:46] Viriskali15: I'm so excited for elden ring
[0:28:47] ImaginaryBestFriend: new to the world of marketing NODDERS
[0:28:57] DangerRangerRex: That does not fit what I desire. So it obviously must be false cohhHmm
[0:28:58] SergeitZ: When is the NDA up?
[0:29:00] BarryCarlyon: The NDA period gives content creators time to prepare their videos and content for release at the embargo lifing. So all the people on youtube publish their review at the same time. For example
[0:29:01] Amazhulaan: nyannHackers
[0:29:05] GraveSalad: man, remember when magazines would get games months early so they could beat it to release a review in their magazine? People don't remember pre-internet
[0:29:08] Sir_Dakk: The fact that they are putting it out 2+ months in advance gives me hope
[0:29:15] SZebra: Crunchyroll Premium is coming to XBOX Game Pass Ultimate chat, if you didn't already know.
[0:29:22] Mrshilka: I signed NDA looking at top Secret military hardware where if I even talked aobut it outside of work I would be tried for treason, just so they could also sue me after

[0:40:23] sirgnug: if streamer say so it must be tru Kappa
[0:40:24] Alanthesheep: Try top look for a planet like Jupiter but 25x isn't great. Lunar astronomy should be fine so when you get to look at the moon look along the terminator. The line between dark and light

[0:40:56] WilliamKurokami: I've used Star Walk 1 and 2
[0:40:59] Darkaros: I remember I went stargazing in the mountains, our guide was able to point out multiple constellations, I was too dumb to see any of them except *maybe* the big dipper
[0:40:59] AnorienNightwish: I've used Star Walk 2 couple of times

[0:41:24] Mrshilka: @Darkaros lol

[0:41:39] WilliamKurokami: Star Walk 2 has AR as well I think
[0:41:40] midas_89: or
[0:41:40] Alanthesheep: OG guts use math and a standard equatorial mount/. If you get really into it you can get mounts that track objects for you these days
[0:41:44] midas_89: Sky Map
[0:41:46] Alanthesheep: *guys

[0:43:09] AnorienNightwish: i haven't really had any issues with the ads on Star walk 2 the couple of times I've used it
[0:43:14] Nardap: buys a expensive telescope and then complains about 3 dollars
[0:43:15] SlipCrit: is this video from the 90s?
[0:43:15] DrTazerFace: Yea imagine having to pay something not to get ads
[0:43:19] CanadianEevee: If you use that they will sell your information to the aliens

[1:04:42] reminkly: yes
[1:04:53] xarantur: @itmeJP the reason for treshes change. is that he basically stole a shitload of souls during the ruination and regained human form
[1:04:53] 0ldnslow: Don't play LOL is Power in game?

[1:06:17] Darkaros: His sister-wife? D: I didn't know this was Crusader Kings
[1:06:18] RoniBranco: Wifu
[1:06:18] reminkly: Thresh stole her soul and is tormenting Lucian w/ it
[1:06:19] Dasutin23: They were roommates
[1:06:24] reminkly: so he frees her
[1:06:26] duen75: step sister wife?
[1:06:30] yrvengalied: Step wife ?
[1:06:31] Baludor: Senna was in Lucians lore from his release, but this is the first time they ever actually showed her, so it was a big deal
[1:06:39] ShuGaming: these animations rivals blizzards

[1:06:47] johnfive21: she was hinted at for years before this

[1:06:51] yrvengalied: did he ?
[1:06:56] TXPumpFIST: luci9n thought i was gone, but i was only changed
[1:07:04] Jukettaja: Hah

[1:07:47] Nathanisms: @Razayken The one we dont talk about?
[1:07:47] Darkaros: This sounds like the person who used to say "EA: Challenge Everything"
[1:08:14] Sharkabatu: ruination was a cool idea but executed poorly. I think most of the effort was on Arcane then
[1:08:15] yrvengalied: @Darkaros the good old day of actually good EA and EA Big
[1:08:18] Tenivir: Is Arcane watchable for someone who has never touched League and never will?
[1:08:21] Altair900: There two of my favorite alongside Ekko
[1:08:22] Tenivir: or do you miss too much
[1:08:24] Altair900: Theyre* derp

[1:24:33] Baludor: I think that's why they're putting so much time into fleshing out the lore of the cities now
[1:24:39] thanh_n2004: they got the ingredients yea, hopefully they can build an decent MMO with it
[1:24:39] DeadlyBrother: did he watch the yone/yasuo ones yet?

[1:39:55] epicshoo: not unless it's the enemy team

[1:40:43] Nogardknight: ah, Janna, the OG overpowered support
[1:40:52] vin88x: Is JP playing with Strippin, chat?
[1:40:57] SlipCrit: @camjek lo fi beats to study and chill too is a good one
[1:40:58] Darkaros: not atm vin88x
[1:41:02] zerohour_88: alistar can give you some nice engage if you get to the midgame, at least
[1:41:04] SkylerKK: So you don't push the wave
[1:41:06] freaker286: think so you dont over push wave early
[1:41:12] Disb3liever: because you don't want o push the lane early
[1:41:12] Ahoy_NATO: Taking E early forces you to push which isnt always good
[1:41:14] vin88x: Ah, just noticed both playing. Thanks @Darkaros
[1:41:25] BakaOniiChan_: if you get E first you passively push the lane due to aoe. making you vulnerable for early ganks
[1:41:32] Nurama: Have you gone against swain draven yet? That combo is BRUTAL
[1:41:49] zerohour_88: laning against Janna does that
[1:41:58] Jzimmy15: @itmeJP WOL says you have 44 hours played this season
[1:42:03] TXPumpFIST: sivir was one of my baes season 2ish

[1:43:01] zerohour_88: this ali knows the charge stun combo, that's enough for him
[1:43:04] Walshmobile: you farm behind their tower
[1:43:04] epicshoo: ew a proxy singed
[1:43:05] Lindobu: proxy KEKW
[1:43:08] MmmDoggy: Nice play
[1:43:11] Baludor: Singed is just a weird champ. He doesn't really play like anyone else
[1:43:11] Nogardknight: singed doing singed things
[1:43:15] Ahoy_NATO: learning how and when to push lane and how to trade well bot lane is the key to ADC success
[1:43:45] Lindobu: i think wave control is a really good skill to learn for every laner
[1:44:05] Nurama: wave control is good for everyone even the jngler
[1:44:23] Wildskunk: POGGERS
[1:44:26] Ahoy_NATO: it's especially good on ADC since you scale with Gold more than any other role
[1:44:27] NotYourLad: they're slow pushing a huge wave into you so that's pretty good back timing
[1:44:28] Kymix: POGGERS

[1:48:21] Nogardknight: it's okay, singed just proxy farms waves and doesn't care
[1:48:22] Darkaros: 2/3 winning lanes MmmHmm
[1:48:29] Sha1yen: He's singed, they always feed, doesn't matter if it's bronze or challenger
[1:48:48] Lindobu: if they don't know how to respond to a proxy singed you'll have a carrying singed soon KEKW
[1:48:51] Nako_Bocchi: @zerohour_88 yup, it's still very core to singed gameplay

[1:49:16] Disb3liever: I mean it was a easy prediction, the adc was half hp and no mana, but walking forward @camjek
[1:49:24] koalakims: @Lindobu proxy singed still a thing?
[1:49:34] Nurama: Me :)
[1:49:48] Lindobu: @koalakims it still works but i think only in lower elo cause people aren't aware/don't know wave control
[1:49:50] LagoutLoud: She flashed that bush for sure
[1:50:07] Kaddhy_2k10: its more usual, thank ya think
[1:50:10] Lindobu: now with plating it's really easy to answer to a proxy singed but this jayce doesn't seem to know MmmHmm

[1:50:56] TXPumpFIST: ye ali my main
[1:50:58] koalakims: @Lindobu I haven't played in like 6 years but JP makes me wanna play again
[1:51:00] ag_blues: Remember when exhaust also slowed enemy attack speed? You would consistently 1v1 Jax as an ADC lol.
[1:51:07] Sha1yen: Next time you're about to jump in, there'll be a voice in your head going "nah bruh, tower"
[1:51:08] Kaddhy_2k10: gud call, dont agro towers to much
[1:51:10] TXPumpFIST: wish hexflash amd stuff was on wild rift tho
[1:51:13] Nogardknight: yeah, their team can't do too much to stop Ali it seems outside of Janna ult
[1:51:18] epicshoo: should probably let ali last hit a minion or two with those charges
[1:51:21] koalakims: @Lindobu proxy singed was my jam
[1:51:26] TXPumpFIST: only protobelt emchant for boots on wr
[1:51:39] Lindobu: @koalakims i really think if you like mobas, rito have done a decent job at moderating the toxicity no joke obviosly it still can be bad but
[1:51:42] Disb3liever: singed just screwing with shaco now...lol
[1:51:44] Survivor_mkII: enemy shaco no pinks wards?
[1:52:05] Sunhammer756: lol that throw
[1:52:06] AlexLeveling: that flip LUL
[1:52:08] zynessa: @koalakims Honestly, all mobas are dumpsterfires when it comes to toxicity.
[1:52:11] Lindobu: the first time i ranked i reached gold by going support singed KEKW
[1:52:22] Big_Headed_Gamer: singed flipping the guy the wrong way LOL
[1:52:23] zenoots: support singed OP
[1:52:32] koalakims: @Lindobu yeah I think I'm slightly nostalgic for the salt if I'm being honest
[1:52:33] zerohour_88: everyone gone those bloodlust eyes KEKW
[1:52:43] Nurama: @zynessa you mean team based competitive online games right? cause yeah they all do
[1:52:44] uui23: it went wrong when signed did a wrong flip
[1:52:52] DagooX: danGreed
[1:52:53] Keyah: Cho getting big as well
[1:53:11] Big_Headed_Gamer: silver lust is fine early game. it's late game where it gets scary
[1:53:14] Big_Headed_Gamer: atpRtsd
[1:53:39] uui23: the R stacks infintely + potion
[1:53:43] AlexLeveling: shaco was top in his jf
[1:53:45] AlexLeveling: jg
[1:53:46] Nogardknight: Alistair establishing dominance
[1:54:09] epicshoo: monkaS
[1:54:12] zerohour_88: a mad cow on the loose is always fun
[1:54:19] Keyah: Nah, Shaco just killed Sylus at pit. That's where he got the gold
[1:54:23] veif__: 500 is only the bonus, 300 for kill, so in total 800 gold
[1:54:39] epicshoo: MmmHmm monies
[1:54:43] Big_Headed_Gamer: PogChamp 1200 monies
[1:54:48] Darkaros: math adds up PepoG
[1:54:48] AlexLeveling: you could have use R on TF to push him in the tower. But hey you lived so JG :)
[1:54:57] veif__: 800 and 1000 so 1800 gold shaco got
[1:55:00] Big_Headed_Gamer: it's silver. nothing to be scared about atpRtsd
[1:55:29] zerohour_88: why was ali scouting the bush, that was weird
[1:55:35] zechetto: If you didnt kill the clone you could live
[1:55:47] Nogardknight: they have a Jayce?!?!
[1:55:50] Gat0rCh0mp: His clone turning into boxes and fearing you on killing it cost you there
[1:55:55] Gat0rCh0mp: Yes 3 boxes
[1:55:57] Walshmobile: 3 of em yeah
[1:56:00] ParaSycthe: Yeah he drops 3 boxes that fear
[1:56:00] AlexLeveling: yeah 3 of them
[1:56:01] paradigmshitf: Yes JP 3 boxes and it fears you
[1:56:02] zechetto: 3, yes
[1:56:11] veif__: when it says "bonus" its only the bonus ontop of 300 gold, so shaco got in total 1800 for 2 kills
[1:56:16] Big_Headed_Gamer: he can self activate it or it happens on kill
[1:56:23] Keyah: 101: If a Shaco willing walks towards you - It's probably a clone.
[1:56:25] Lindobu: the clone also deals ap damage close around where he dies on top of the 3 boxes
[1:56:44] AlexLeveling: and all 3 are linked so it's enough to kill one and they all go away. but the Fear is the issue unless he's full AP
[1:57:07] Sathias: @keyah I've used that as Shaco, run into a bush, ult, send the clone away and walk towards them, they always chase the clone KEKW
[1:57:11] thrillhouse451: Sharkisha nooooooo

[2:12:30] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Phen0m oh you mean like ones that were animated. yeah they came a long way but riot still shafts you on prices and most of them don't look so hot.
[2:12:34] Jukettaja: At least Soraka is more annoying than Morgana
[2:12:37] titanodin: after morg misses Q she is basicly useless
[2:12:41] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: have you ever heard of cheater recalls. In not you might want to look them up.

[2:23:11] Big_Headed_Gamer: PogChamp
[2:23:26] DagooX: greyCR
[2:23:34] Phen0m: if Ashe got shutdown gold, maybe not
[2:23:35] Jukettaja: They usually focus Soraka because she heals people so you get free DPS during that period
[2:23:36] Keyah: Soraka was peeling. Should've just attacked him. Ashe missed
[2:24:05] Phen0m: Oh, that's fine then
[2:24:19] Kymix: tf almost died o.o

[2:25:55] Jukettaja: Auto Attack I believe
[2:26:11] leaback: its tricky to learn it. JP have you got the 'a' key bound to see your aa range?
[2:26:24] TamboTv: u lost a lot of damage in that fight with running
[2:26:28] AevisCat: probably refers to orb walking / stutter stepping
[2:26:30] Kalbatronas: sr got used to league short stuff it was just atack move
[2:26:31] TamboTv: yeah u would atleast got a trade
[2:26:43] AlexLeveling: rift ?

[2:27:09] SlipCrit: i just got an email saying i was approved for something and i got excited and then realised it wasnt for elden ring Sadge
[2:27:15] Kalbatronas: A Atack in meaning atack with A on click while moving

[2:27:58] Gat0rCh0mp: And the minions took turret

[2:31:32] Seregrim: he ran it down FOR DEMACIA
[2:31:40] freakytk: how he as 220fps in teamfights holy shit..monster pc?
[2:31:42] DCHenkels: b-but this isn't ARAM
[2:31:43] Felgrun: but he's ionian
[2:31:45] afreak10: that skin makes her look big
[2:31:45] freakytk: has*
[2:31:46] WSeveryn: @itmeJP Okay I have a question about the show on Netflix, how does it tie into this?  Cause that show is great, but I didn't know this had  fiction about it.
[2:31:54] AlexLeveling: @Seregrim isn't shen from ionia ?
[2:32:05] Big_Headed_Gamer: so both your team and enemy team have great CC but their team has 0 engage except for LEEROY yi and Shen
[2:32:07] Felgrun: @freakytk League is very light
[2:32:19] Seregrim: uhm sure >< ^^
[2:32:25] FoxFacedMasks: @WSeveryn it gives backstory to some of the characters. Over the last few years they have been adding lore and other story elements into the game
[2:32:33] Jukettaja: Soraka just bails everyone so hard
[2:32:36] Walshmobile: that was great silence by raka
[2:32:37] Jukettaja: I can't stand playing against her
[2:32:39] konvay: For 15+ kill participations, would that CS be expected? Or still low?
[2:32:40] freakytk: @Felgrun its not that light anymore actually.. on max graphics its looks actually really great
[2:32:54] DagooX: tactical retreat monkaS
[2:33:03] PhoenixGlory: hows it goin?
[2:33:04] MostlyHype: hey chat did i miss the cinematics?
[2:33:08] Jukettaja: Yes
[2:33:15] Felgrun: @freakytk Unless there has been some massive overhaul this year it doesnt look great at all LUL
[2:33:16] zynessa: @WSeveryn League itself doesn't typically have much lore presented in the actual game, it's mainly setting and backstory and context to the characters already in League. And of course, it will tie in much more so with the expanded IP in the form of the other games Riot are working on, that allow for more story stuff.
[2:33:17] MostlyHype: SaDGE
[2:33:24] Big_Headed_Gamer: of all the things to go double carry with they took ashe and varus. weird pick
[2:33:29] AevisCat: @konvay depends on elo. it's fine for this
[2:33:30] Big_Bean_Sac: Man the notifications are REALLY delayed after this latest LoL patch. 5 minutes later, Double Kill! What? All the fights have been over for a full minute...

[2:35:12] WSeveryn: @zynessa Okay, the animation is pretty amazing, but LoL isn't really my type of game.  Any idea if the new MMO they are working on will be based in that world, because taht seems amazing if it is.
[2:35:29] freakytk: @Felgrun i got a gtx 1050 ti and only get  240fps at start, in lategame teamfights i only got 90-100fps

[2:58:53] Samc27: Just let him play guys, I’m sure he will ask for situational advice if he wants it
[2:59:23] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too!

[3:02:37] Jukettaja: The sad thing about Yuumi is that she's actually better at supporting tanks and bruisers
[3:02:43] Jukettaja: Because they don't die instantly
[3:02:48] Jukettaja: So you get sustained heals
[3:03:10] KiDtaztic: they shouldnt be there IMO

[3:10:42] ghostsofcarcosa: I just noticed that guys name
[3:10:42] AnorienNightwish: is it player review or am i thinking of dota system? (dont play either game)
[3:10:54] Darkaros: Dota has player reviews of reports
[3:11:04] Disb3liever: lague use to have player review, was removed a number of years back.
[3:11:11] ghostsofcarcosa: COVID 19 is unstoppable is not a message I expected to see pop up
[3:11:12] Disb3liever: leauge
[3:11:13] Ceratic: Yeah I miss Tribunal, it was fun
[3:11:17] Midnight_Tank: I thought League has a council system
[3:11:25] Darkaros: oh they removed Tribunal? Sadge
[3:11:28] Baludor: Tribunal was fun, but it's defo not healthy for the game
[3:11:32] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP Tell WW he is legendary at dying KEKW
[3:11:33] PhoenixGlory: tribunal removed since like season 3
[3:11:37] Disb3liever: oh ya, it was removed a long time ago
[3:11:42] Altair900: JP tilting people like tilting people like this gives me a form of genuine joy I didn't know I needed again
[3:11:47] Ahoy_NATO: or if yuumi gives you a heal
[3:11:55] SEye6: Tribunal failed as is dota player review system
[3:11:58] KiDtaztic: yuumi needs to be on you tho, but yuumi's are dumb
[3:11:59] alskgj: or just use exhaust

[3:13:36] Cixah: you def can
[3:13:37] DerfOnTurf: No payoff PepeHands
[3:13:37] KiDtaztic: yeah you can
[3:13:40] afreak10: u can
[3:13:42] ProxyClouds: @itmejp don’t forget the Blitz build. I’m off for tonight. GL with the rest of the matches
[3:13:43] Fireema: he was typing his thesis in the report window
[3:13:47] KiDtaztic: they ban you from chat
[3:13:51] Ahoy_NATO: no you get banned for even less bad stuff like the tard word
[3:13:52] Gliverz: now im tilted, he wasnt tilted enough to say anything ;)
[3:13:55] Altair900: a bunch of that stuff is instant chat ban nowadays I thought
[3:13:58] zucroh: @itmeJP I'm sure you've been asked a lot but what did you think of the 2 & 3rd episode of arcane ?
[3:14:03] Felgrun: Yeah chat stuff usually is more bannable than inting and trolling and shit
[3:14:04] afreak10: u can ignore players to not match with them ?
[3:14:05] Darkaros: !arcane
[3:14:05] itmeBOT: JP co-streamed Arcane episode 1 and watched episodes 2 and 3 afterward and enjoyed it a lot! He thought it was the best video game adaptation into a TV show etc so far, over stuff like Castelvania/Dota/Witcher.
[3:14:09] Daruvik: If someone is being toxic like that, going against the "summoner's code" that all players are forced to agree to, then they'll take action.
[3:14:22] afreak10: true
[3:14:27] Big_Headed_Gamer: atpRtsd
[3:14:38] Felgrun: No one would ever play league again
[3:14:42] The_Faceless_Void: teemo inc
[3:14:44] Darkaros: Ya, remember when Overwatch had avoiding players KEKW some Widow main couldn't get any games
[3:14:44] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW
[3:14:44] Felgrun: So thats good
[3:14:44] ghostsofcarcosa: Oh man better than Castlevania I hadn't watched Arcane yet, but now definitely gotta check it.
[3:14:47] KiDtaztic: I'd log on just for urf
[3:14:49] Gliverz: league would be a 1v1 game
[3:15:08] The_Faceless_Void: its busted
[3:15:10] The_Faceless_Void: it sucks
[3:15:16] Brando_Flakes: Brando_Flakes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 65 months!

[3:15:23] Big_Headed_Gamer: a l
[3:15:26] The_Faceless_Void: I ranked with 4 randoms 3 ques backed out and we all match again
[3:15:26] Big_Headed_Gamer: ot of
[3:15:29] Lonefellow: Chat, do people still play Zilean?
[3:15:30] TheXtractor: I think its more certain ranked players play certain champs more often
[3:15:32] Ahoy_NATO: veigar is very good, might have one of the strongest abilities in the game, and he stomps low elo
[3:15:32] bakacatt: https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/11-21-chaehas-challenger-adc-miss-fortune-guide-588263
[3:15:33] SEye6: Veigar again
[3:15:40] KiDtaztic: idk JP, ppl tend to play meta in low elo
[3:15:40] TheXtractor: certain champions are very popular in certain ranks
[3:15:42] Madracah: the R the N , racism , homophobia , threat of harm all are instant temp bans without any need for context revision. Enough off those is perm.
[3:15:42] OdinX1: I feel like thats the case in league in general because of whats "good"
[3:15:46] bakacatt: MF GIDE
[3:15:46] CDubTheRIPper: who's brazilian?
[3:15:50] Felgrun: And thats probably the reason why you will never see an aurelion sol ever
[3:16:04] Big_Headed_Gamer: a lot of people tend to use guides that show what champs dominate hardest in this elo cause they are so desperate to climb
[3:16:06] TheXtractor: @Felgrun i mean thats like no matter cuz nobody plays this :D
[3:16:09] Duncain: you have a mundo support...
[3:16:15] KiDtaztic: Sol isnt popular
[3:16:17] CDubTheRIPper: ijpMONKA
[3:16:19] Runforyerlives: Veigar is the most picked character ever. It is just easy with him.
[3:16:22] Daruvik: Kick their Ashe
[3:16:23] Xaine25: @itmeJP Only Overwatch ranked can compete with League for sadness value.
[3:16:24] iamjustacow: make sure you have the right masteries this time
[3:16:30] zechetto: mundo sup?!?
[3:16:34] KiDtaztic: Ashe is my adc main
[3:16:37] Disb3liever: its time to stop league is what the game is saying
[3:16:45] Felgrun: Mundo goes where he pleases
[3:16:47] The_Faceless_Void: dodge the game
[3:16:48] The_Faceless_Void: HELL NO
[3:16:50] OdinX1: Support mundo isnt too terrible
[3:16:50] Darkaros: Prediction has started! Will JP win or lose
[3:16:51] Big_Headed_Gamer: your supports tilted
[3:16:53] TheXtractor: I love that players will go to any length to avoid playing a normal support champion xD
[3:16:56] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[3:16:57] OdinX1: Hes alright for poke
[3:16:57] KiDtaztic: I done mundo support before rework, its hit or miss
[3:16:59] pelazzo: nasus mid?
[3:17:07] Ahoy_NATO: picks dont really matter at your rank imo
[3:17:09] TasPlays: It's not awful. HE won't do much for you, except draw attention away
[3:17:09] Daruvik: 15K against JP, got it
[3:17:12] KiDtaztic: just farm and trade wisely,
[3:17:24] titanodin: 50k on loss
[3:17:27] KiDtaztic: nah you have tanks, should be fine
[3:17:27] Felgrun: I believe in the offmeta
[3:17:28] OdinX1: Nasus mid a bit sus but AP nasus is a thing
[3:17:32] zechetto: @titanodin LOL
[3:17:34] TasPlays: At least you have a VERY decent frontline
[3:17:36] Darkaros: honestly I thought people didn't pick unorthodox characters in LoL cuz it didn't work
[3:17:38] TheCakeGoesMoo: 19k win I believe
[3:17:38] iamjustacow: ap nasus mid lol
[3:17:43] Big_Headed_Gamer: is the mundo rework for the better or ?
[3:17:45] DerfOnTurf: Take the odds on win NODDERS
[3:17:52] Runforyerlives: @Big_Headed_Gamer worse
[3:17:52] Felgrun: Veigar support gonna be real annoying
[3:18:01] OdinX1: I believe chat
[3:18:02] Disb3liever: @Darkaros in lower ranks its works, because players usally don't know how to deal with it.
[3:18:04] OmegaCrits: Going all in on WIN! Lets Go @itmeJP
[3:18:04] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Big_Headed_Gamer riot atpRtsuspectd
[3:18:05] titanodin: @itmeJP honestly your team is THICCCC
[3:18:10] TasPlays: 10k on win, I believe
[3:18:13] Necrolegion: I got money on win. I have faith!
[3:18:16] KiDtaztic: win win win
[3:18:16] TheXtractor: I will imagine the teamfight is everyone just goes in and leaves JP behind alone on MF
[3:18:17] Felgrun: Lets go Believers
[3:18:19] TheXtractor: with 4 melees :P
[3:18:29] ghostsofcarcosa: I believe
[3:18:31] Big_Headed_Gamer: modCheck
[3:18:31] iUncouth: also put 10k on win, I still believe
[3:18:34] pelazzo: @Darkaros you also get alot of people who hard one trick and just play there one champ where  ever they get
[3:18:36] AlexLeveling: that Nocturne on you is rough. Your team has nothing to peel for you
[3:18:37] woofser: I believe Prayge
[3:18:45] Runforyerlives: they gutted his w so much it deals no dmg
[3:18:47] Duncain: 50k on win, you got this
[3:18:52] Darkaros: pelazzo ya but that's normal in Mobas
[3:18:55] OdinX1: I enjoy playing offmeta supports so i always stand by things like mundo
[3:18:59] Daruvik: and Ekko just gon split push all game OpieOP
[3:19:01] Big_Headed_Gamer: oh you have a nasus. this is a late game game
[3:19:04] Big_Headed_Gamer: goodluck
[3:19:07] KiDtaztic: you have a wombo combo in malphie ult then you E + R
[3:19:10] AnorienNightwish: someone has a potato PC
[3:19:17] Runforyerlives: Darkness
[3:19:20] Runforyerlives: ded
[3:19:22] Big_Headed_Gamer: PauseChamp dodge?
[3:19:23] Disb3liever: 2 grievous wound items ruins your comp.
[3:19:23] Darkaros: I'm used to Dota where half of the roster can play every role though lol
[3:19:33] Felgrun: They are all gonna DC right after 5 minutes
[3:19:35] DerfOnTurf: Load game modCheck
[3:19:39] Daruvik: @Disb3liever pretty accurate
[3:19:45] TheCakeGoesMoo: their Intel pentium 2s are going full speed rn
[3:19:52] PhoenixGlory: my bet is one of them dies once and afks
[3:19:52] Woolfius_: odds of mundo just leaving after loading in
[3:19:57] M0rblD: is someone loading from tape?
[3:20:03] Madracah: think its the client at this point.
[3:20:05] Altair900: @TheCakeGoesMoo NODDERS
[3:20:07] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Darkaros league is at that state but you need to be a good player
[3:20:12] afreak10: Wood pc or someone left
[3:20:13] AlexLeveling: maybe someone on your team made the smart decision to dodge but pressed teh button too late
[3:20:17] TheXtractor: ah yes loading screen problems one of the big reasons i quit league
[3:20:19] Big_Headed_Gamer: someone turned off their PC for sure
[3:20:20] Disb3liever: someone tried dodging last second proly and failed
[3:20:22] Felgrun: You understimate the slowness of HDDs
[3:20:44] Darkaros: @Darkaros ya I heard League's at the most diverse it's ever been?
[3:20:45] Lethin83: Maybe Upgrade your pc JP Kappa
[3:20:50] Woolfius_: when did they remove the ability to see the other players load percentage?
[3:20:50] DerfOnTurf: This is borked NODDERS
[3:20:55] Leqqq: i just played normal game after 6 years, and my server is still very toxic haha
[3:20:56] DagooX: this game used to run on a toaster, no?
[3:20:58] TheCakeGoesMoo: not everyone has an epic pc JP KEKW
[3:21:14] AnorienNightwish: hypeE 4%hypeE We loaded in hypeE
[3:21:16] Disb3liever: @Woolfius_ like 6 seasons ago, to remove grifing of slow loaders.
[3:21:21] Felgrun: Purple gun for luck lets go
[3:21:36] Disb3liever: griefing*
[3:21:42] Ebra: ya
[3:21:42] AlexLeveling: Did you ever consider starting with a refillable potion ?
[3:21:43] Dox023: I missed the end of that last missfortune game. Did JP win?
[3:21:51] OdinX1: Yup
[3:21:51] Felgrun: Yeah his E deals a bunch of damage and is real easy to land
[3:21:52] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Darkaros i would agree to that statement but yeah you def need good comprehension if you are trying to make a champ a meta of a role they aren't
[3:21:52] TasPlays: Probably not well, but the ring might be just for early sustain
[3:21:52] synreir: you can but he is not
[3:21:52] Madracah: dont think he is AP , just took the band for mana regen.
[3:21:56] Disb3liever: Ap nasus just levels E and drops aoe bombs.
[3:21:59] Daruvik: yup, AP can work on susaN, just not recommended for him
[3:22:00] Dox023: nice
[3:22:01] TheXtractor: cohhBless
[3:22:06] afreak10: PepeSuspicious
[3:22:07] Woolfius_: Disb3liever ah i see, makes sense
[3:22:08] Dox023: not nice
[3:22:09] Dox023: sadness

[3:32:25] TheXtractor: i feel confident in my win prediction
[3:32:34] Darkaros: wiggle_everytime_boop Dota has music packs instead ijpSIP
[3:32:55] Felgrun: That veigar ulti did like, not a lot of damage
[3:33:01] TheXtractor: league needs to add some custom announcer and music to use ingame
[3:33:03] TheXtractor: that would be great
[3:33:08] Big_Headed_Gamer: atpDance
[3:33:08] Darkaros: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_cZtv_qaCI I'm a fan of this music pack in particular ratJAM
[3:33:16] wiggle_everytime_boop: remember that time JP played that 80s music as motivational music for getting over it? xD
[3:33:23] wiggle_everytime_boop: @Darkaros what do you mean?
[3:33:25] Felgrun: GP needs to come back as an announcer
[3:33:46] CaptainFalkyn: you were like 150g short
[3:33:51] DagooX: monkaS
[3:33:55] bakacatt: quicksilver sash bay vs ashe arow
[3:33:58] Darkaros: wiggle_everytime_boop There's in-game music in Dota, and music packs that replace these tracks. They play at the start of games, after killers, etc
[3:34:06] Darkaros: kills*
[3:34:07] wiggle_everytime_boop: ahh ok
[3:34:15] PoloChubb: i think she flashed

[3:35:34] Disb3liever: Garen be roammmmingggg
[3:35:36] Big_Headed_Gamer: you needed mythic for that fight i think
[3:35:44] Disb3liever: You could not have played that different
[3:35:45] TPLivewire: Yeah, you did what you could, not much better outcome with what you had
[3:36:02] CaptainFalkyn: 1 for 1 probably better than just running and dying to garen's flash anyway
[3:36:48] bakacatt: all top if se ashe s and veigar lane bay quicksilver sash
[3:37:04] DagooX: catJAM
[3:37:39] Disb3liever: wait till veiger uses his stun
[3:37:41] Disb3liever: then go in
[3:37:49] TheXtractor: You dont have much CC and they have two stuns so engaging on them is pretty hard.
[3:37:56] TheXtractor: Easier to just poke  them out of lane and get plates
[3:38:00] AlexLeveling: Ashe can stop your R with her R, no ?
[3:38:10] Disb3liever: yes @AlexanderLeads
[3:38:21] TheXtractor: ah no more plates but at least get turret :D
[3:38:27] Big_Headed_Gamer: yeah but it's silver. they dont think that far ahead

[3:48:29] Lindobu: i'm pretty sure tear should be bough close to first recall
[3:48:51] Sonatta: chat has infiltrated JP's game monkaSHAKE
[3:48:53] LagoutLoud: I  mean they CAN peel for you, but they won't :)
[3:49:07] TheXtractor: worrying and optimizing item builds will probably come later. its kinda difficult to know what to buy
[3:49:09] konvay: one of those "yes yes yes" to "no no no" :/ it was looking so good and then the blind Veigar wall ijpCRY
[3:49:23] Big_Headed_Gamer: malph got shrekt

[3:49:43] UAjech: @itmeJP can i recommend a different item build for you?
[3:49:45] TheXtractor: although i would def recommend trying out cleanse instead of heal vs veigar for example
[3:49:46] fraggleroctv: nasus slow is pretty good peel
[3:49:49] Barba06: No need to peel if you just kill them first :)
[3:49:55] LagoutLoud: Ehh, your team has a ton of slow

[3:52:13] MADCERBERO: cloakSpin cloakSpin cloakSpin
[3:52:17] Darkaros: I think bakacatt doesn't understand how Quicksilver Sash (which removes CC debuffs) is not comparable to Dota's BKB (which is complete magic immunity for 4-10 seconds) LUL
[3:52:23] TheXtractor: cohhL cohhGV

[3:55:19] Joebeezer: thanks
[3:55:20] KantemirkO: @Darkaros I just remember JP talking about a fishing stream with Strippin Gassy NL and others
[3:55:20] TheXtractor: Aram is actually pretty fun to learn teamfighting and poking
[3:55:25] Daruvik: Yeah, just relies on the other team to cluster up
[3:55:27] TuketTheKettu: @itmeJP you gonna play the new league season?
[3:55:29] Felgrun: I tried playing smite for a bit and oh boy I cant dodge anything
[3:55:31] OdinX1: Yup, you and malph ulting together will be disgusting
[3:55:36] Barba06: That malphite is a tank by the way, died in 3 seconds :)
[3:55:50] KiDtaztic: your team is playing weird tho, going in 1 by 1
[3:56:00] Smellypickle3: Does every hero have a ward they can place?
[3:56:00] Runforyerlives: @TheXtractor Nah, they get salty about that game mode as well. So much it is not even fun.
[3:56:04] Felgrun: I think you healed the garen
[3:56:21] Joebeezer: that is one tanky boy
[3:56:21] TheXtractor: unfortunately people get salty even in coop vs ai ><
[3:56:37] OdinX1: Imagine if malph was alive for that fight tho
[3:56:40] KiDtaztic: you can kill once manamune is done, but your team is losing mental
[3:56:49] Archangel3003: @kidtaztic That's a good chunk of Lol games in my experience.
[3:56:49] Felgrun: I once made a yasuo quit in coop vs ai because I stole his krugs
[3:56:53] OdinX1: You just need to regroup and play as 5 i think
[3:56:55] afreak10: geez
[3:56:59] Feederstorm: you should get some armor penetration , like seryldas grudge
[3:57:02] Joebeezer: life as an adc
[3:57:07] DagooX: Sadge
[3:57:17] CaptainFalkyn: this is why I don't play MF without a duo partner
[3:57:20] Malvburo: adc Sadge
[3:57:22] TheXtractor: As a proffesional i can say that was totally fun to play against
[3:57:22] LegendsOfBobby: nasus aoe shreds armor chat?
[3:57:25] epicshoo: Pepega 📣 you should-!
[3:57:25] KiDtaztic: @Archangel3003 yeah someone gotta shotcall but thats the struggle
[3:57:26] JestinJae: @Smellypickle3 they /can/, its the default item for a special slot, but there are three you can choose from
[3:57:34] Felgrun: Just get *that item* it will solve all your problems and you're gonna win the lottery 4Head
[3:57:34] Darkaros: JP is no longer accepting item tips
[3:57:35] Daruvik: Wish you had a Leona, but can't pick the randoms in your game Sadge
[3:57:41] WeeMr_Goodcat: get my halo xbox in 2 days, hyppppe
[3:57:41] Joebeezer: so is mundo support an auto dodge for now on?
[3:57:44] KiDtaztic: they need to go back mid, tbh
[3:57:45] ImaginaryBestFriend: yeah adc has been rough since the assassin meta in like season 5 KEKW
[3:57:48] 0VincentRayne0: You can’t rely on ult because your ult goes with crit and you are building lethality. But this is rough with noct back line diving
[3:57:49] Altair900: Pepega 📣 streamer have you considered >insert action here
[3:57:52] DagooX: KEKW
[3:57:52] Necrolegion: Sounds like you got a case of the Mundo’s Kappa
[3:58:01] coomergmr: mf... ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:58:05] CaptainFalkyn: "support" veugare
[3:58:07] CaptainFalkyn: veigar
[3:58:09] fraggleroctv: Supporting kinda expires after laning phase in League LUL
[3:58:09] HopelessNorwegian: Not knowing League here, so genuinly interested in knowing why Mundo is a bad support?
[3:58:15] Archangel3003: @kidtaztic Usually someone shit calls and says let's go do X, then is the only person to go and dies LUL
[3:58:29] DerfOnTurf: Having Never played LOL I woul suggest "x" item mr streamer
[3:58:38] TheXtractor: @HopelessNorwegian Its mostly just not made for supporting. its more of a jungle/tank so it doesnt help you that much
[3:58:42] KiDtaztic: @Archangel3003 yeah most of my honors are shot calling and its tough
[3:58:47] 0VincentRayne0: Mundo can’t cc nor peel nor heal teammates which is stuff support needs to do
[3:58:48] The_Spinach_Inquisition: I have no idea how to play LoL, and I don't know what I am talking about, so I am going to suggest JP have you tried buying the Super Sheep, Banana Bomb and Holy Hand Grenade
[3:58:49] Phen0m: @HopelessNorwegian Supports tend to have kits that help their carry in lane, or at least setups for picks. Mundo doesn't really do a good job at either
[3:58:50] Duncain: nice
[3:58:52] Joebeezer: not even close bby
[3:58:54] Felgrun: But have you tried summoning exodia
[3:58:54] Theawesomesoccer2: WINNABLE
[3:58:55] KiDtaztic: nice
[3:58:55] Daruvik: @HopelessNorwegian he can't heal/shield the ADC, brings one slow to the table, but has no real ability to peel enemies off the ADC
[3:58:56] DagooX: actually survived POGGERS
[3:58:59] Duncain: calculated
[3:59:02] notzombee: went down to 2hp there for a quick sec, lol
[3:59:04] DezartIII: Does Timewatch still exist?
[3:59:04] Smellypickle3: JP with the plays
[3:59:06] KiDtaztic: manamune almost done
[3:59:10] Malvburo: 2 hp POGGIES
[3:59:12] Barba06: Not gonna lie that Mundo reworked model looks nice though
[3:59:13] WeeMr_Goodcat: GG, shame on the loss, but points for me. get to save up and ban myself. what a great cycle :D
[3:59:18] HopelessNorwegian: So the malph would be a better support perhaps ? Thanks for the clearifications!
[3:59:29] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[3:59:32] TheXtractor: Malph support would def be better
[3:59:34] TheXtractor: still not great tho
[3:59:39] Phen0m: Malph isn't much different prior to getting his ult, but yeah, already better
[3:59:43] TheXtractor: but at level 6 with ult it can have great kill combo
[3:59:46] Daruvik: @HopelessNorwegian Malph's slow, and in particular ULT makes a great setup, so he's a decent support
[3:59:57] Archangel3003: @kidtaztic Yeah I've had a few after just being persistent as nice as I can at telling people what we need to do and hoping they follow.
[3:59:58] TheXtractor: before level 6 tho its literally just like playing with a rock :D
[4:00:02] phonics___: Anybody seen the first couple episodes of Arcane?  It surpassed my expectations
[4:00:07] Darkaros: !arcane
[4:00:07] itmeBOT: JP co-streamed Arcane episode 1 and watched episodes 2 and 3 afterward and enjoyed it a lot! He thought it was the best video game adaptation into a TV show etc so far, over stuff like Castelvania/Dota/Witcher.
[4:00:07] konvay: @HopelessNorwegian What you just saw there was the extent that Mundo can peel. Throw a cleaver that slows. Nothing that really heals/shields his lane partner carry nor debuff or stun an enemy to help secure a kill.
[4:00:11] 0VincentRayne0: Malp is only a support once every two minutes. Outside of that he’s a walking ward
[4:00:29] TheXtractor: There are a lot of fun supports people dont seem to play in low elo
[4:00:33] epicshoo: balanced, as it should be COPIUM
[4:00:33] afreak10: early game was fine , but team fights dropped at end game
[4:00:39] TheXtractor: thresh leona naut
[4:00:48] TuketTheKettu: you are not the only one :)
[4:00:48] HopelessNorwegian: Man, even if this isn't the best game. League looks so fun, but I'm super intimidated by it xD
[4:00:50] Joebeezer: what your stance on dodge games ?
[4:00:52] Daruvik: Leona is bae
[4:00:53] MADCERBERO: ye its hard
[4:00:54] DerfOnTurf: Endless chain of losses FeelsBadMan
[4:00:58] KiDtaztic: @Archangel3003 I usually support but kinda adc this season too and getting ganks is kinda rare
[4:00:59] CaptainFalkyn: you can't solo carry as MF unless the enemy bot lane actually feeds you
[4:01:00] Smellypickle3: Over Castelvania?! Blasphemers.
[4:01:01] JestinJae: well, and not trying to force anything on anyone, but imo support solo Q is HORRIBLE
[4:01:05] Z3r0Fear: Yeah its hard just started playing ranked after playing some normal games to get used to playing again and wow different world it seems
[4:01:08] OdinX1: I dont think the oddball support is the problem here, kayn being alone alot, and malphite playing his own game are alot more of it
[4:01:12] Darkaros: @KantemirkO https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1194911821 -- The fishing thing ended up not being able to fit NL and Gassy in, but it was Cohh + Zeke + Strippin + Jericho + Sips
[4:01:17] ImaginaryBestFriend: this is classic gold/silver/bronze NODDERS the variance of players is crazy
[4:01:18] OdinX1: Mundo has seemed liek hes been doing fine
[4:01:20] JestinJae: so prob most supports are autofill/secondary
[4:01:25] TheXtractor: @Jestin_Jae its not as bad these days since support is actually a strong role. Jungle is worse tbh
[4:01:34] KiDtaztic: I dont usually get ganks but get ganked by my whole enemy team
[4:01:39] epicshoo: too bad zeke only fished for like 5 minutes Sadge
[4:01:44] 0VincentRayne0: I play solo q support and it’s not that bad. I force win lane most games
[4:01:45] KantemirkO: @Darkaros appreciate it, tyvm
[4:02:02] Phen0m: by trying to be a hero and 1v5 probably
[4:02:02] KiDtaztic: He's Kahn
[4:02:03] Darkaros: ijpNODDERS It's a good watch, I'm surprised Regi didn't upload it to YT
[4:02:10] Zydu5: Pog I got a gift from that League bomb! Thanks guys!
[4:02:10] ImaginaryBestFriend: you can tell kayn saw a YT montage and said "i want to do that"
[4:02:12] Felgrun: Because he Kayn't think
[4:02:19] Felgrun: :3
[4:02:22] DerfOnTurf: I mean I bet finding ways to die is one of the few things I could do right in this game
[4:02:26] Z3r0Fear: garen has so much hp omg
[4:02:27] JestinJae: @TheXtractor ah, I haven't tried to main support in like 4+ seasons, I rarely play ranked because I'm mediocre at best.  Truly I belong in Iron (where I am in current season)
[4:02:37] Archangel3003: @kidtaztic I used to adc or support all the time but since getting back into it recently mixing it up and trying top/jungle. Mid is when I'm just in the mood hah.
[4:02:44] CaptainFalkyn: game was over anyway
[4:02:48] TheXtractor: I quit league a year ago but before that I enjoyed playing both adc and support solo :D
[4:02:49] Joebeezer: I want to see garen's build lol
[4:02:54] DagooX: well EZ points as you said KEKW
[4:02:56] PhoenixGlory: well at least i got some channel points lol
[4:02:56] TheXtractor: now i just watch others
[4:02:58] Zydu5: How would i get into this? And i don't want to hear "dont"
[4:03:02] Barba06: honestly, really enjoying these League streams even with the tilt
[4:03:13] Joebeezer: oh that's a full tank garen. I haven't seen that in a while
[4:03:17] CaptainFalkyn: @Zydu5 just start playing against bots
[4:03:19] epicshoo: one more, one more PeepoCheer
[4:03:20] KiDtaztic: @Archangel3003 I change by the season
[4:03:30] 0VincentRayne0: The reason why I main support is because it can carry in lane even if the adc is bad. If you are adc and the support is bad then it’s extremely hard to do much
[4:03:30] Barba06: ah right Kappa
[4:03:32] RlDennis: @Zydu5 Honestly, problaby just vs bots with a friend that can answer some questions
[4:03:33] Z3r0Fear: yeah dinner is being made right now hungry myself
[4:03:34] Daruvik: thank you for your points believers
[4:03:36] ImaginaryBestFriend: believers Sadge
[4:03:38] CaptainFalkyn: okay JP's gone, time to give tips
[4:03:40] DerfOnTurf: Definitely have not seen JP tilt today
[4:03:44] Zydu5: @CaptainFalkyn Ok thank you, Any pareticular hero to start with?
[4:03:46] KiDtaztic: League losing streaks are rough
[4:03:47] Archangel3003: @hopelessnorwegian It's a fun game for sure. Even the losses are not that bad as you at least get some personal experience playing.
[4:03:52] Veilshadow: Does Jp prefer playing solo vs playing with strippin & friends?
[4:04:03] Zydu5: @RlDennis I see! I don't have many of those who play this though
[4:04:07] Felgrun: I never really chose a lane I just choose champions and go wherever they go
[4:04:12] CaptainFalkyn: @Zydu5 a big part of the game is learning all the champions so you can learn how to play against them too. Just try whatever's available on the free rotation and see what you like
[4:04:13] drunkencpt: there's tutorials I think
[4:04:24] DerfOnTurf: Strippin actually said he would never play with JP again because he was too bad Kappa
[4:04:31] Archangel3003: @kidtaztic Keeps thing fresh I guess. I kind of already want to go back to adc though LUL
[4:04:50] RlDennis: @Zydu5 Yeah that's a bit rough, I'm sure some people in the community would be willing to. Hell I even enjoy teaching
[4:04:53] fraggleroctv: bot lane is too many variables to grapple with... makes one lose interest in the game
[4:04:57] Darkaros: I think JP prefers Solo/Duo, and Sam usually ends up with a stack (...except at degen hour night time where they both emerge)
[4:05:13] CaptainFalkyn: in my outdated opinion, tristana is easier to carry with since she has multiple peels
[4:05:17] Zydu5: @CaptainFalkyn I see, do you have to but iems for your heros as well?
[4:05:25] TheXtractor: games with subs when Kappa
[4:05:43] CocoScruff: cozy vibes with this music
[4:05:44] Z3r0Fear: I've learned since coming back that if im going to lose lane then I do my best to not feed at all.
[4:05:46] drunkencpt: @zydu5 Yes, but there is a recommended page that shows up in shop
[4:05:59] CaptainFalkyn: @Zydu5 you set up rune pages outside of game. items are bought in game with the gold you get. play the tutorial to see how it all works
[4:06:19] Z3r0Fear: I've been running into a ton of people playing ADC top and its throwing me off badly
[4:06:21] Zydu5: @RlDennis Sick! Well if i need any tips i know who to call
[4:06:27] KiDtaztic: @Archangel3003 I like ADC to challenge myself, but I like mid too, just not a mid lane I guess lol
[4:06:39] Z3r0Fear: I'm not used to constantly being attacked the entire time while trying to get CS
[4:06:43] Darkaros: @TheXtractor Community Day if JP feels like ruining a day with us Kappa
[4:06:53] KiDtaztic: @Z3r0Fear blame worlds lol
[4:06:55] Zydu5: @drunkencpt Ah convenient! Is there a reeason to ever deviate from that?
[4:06:57] Veilshadow: Honestly I found LoL the most fun when my friends and I would do full group custom games. Ranked literally killed the game for them so we all stopped playing lol
[4:07:01] Master_Metroid: Master_Metroid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[4:07:01] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Master_Metroid! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[4:07:23] Zydu5: @CaptainFalkyn I see didnt know what was explained in the Tut
[4:07:29] Z3r0Fear: I don't like teemo but I'm starting to think of just playing him with all the ADC running top
[4:07:39] Z3r0Fear: maybe i will just start picking ADC for top
[4:07:40] drunkencpt: @zydu5 lots! but not when you"re learning. they're pretty nice
[4:07:53] RlDennis: I always enjoyed playing random new builds that I found interesting. rooVV
[4:07:54] Lindobu: PauseChamp
[4:08:00] KiDtaztic: @Z3r0Fear uhhh you can beat ADCs without playing teemo
[4:08:06] DagooX: PepoG
[4:08:15] drunkencpt: @z3r0fear What top  champs do you play?
[4:08:17] KiDisaster: is that gbay
[4:08:20] Z3r0Fear: @Z3r0Fear I'm like bronze so chances of that happening is low
[4:08:25] Booba__TV: LUL
[4:08:27] DagooX: KEKW
[4:08:32] SlipCrit: wuh

[4:09:02] drunkencpt: @zydu5 always nice helping a fellow dude
[4:09:07] phonics___: Namis is the best to spam
[4:09:12] CaptainFalkyn: where's quinn adc smh
[4:09:13] Z3r0Fear: I've not played the game in years
[4:09:16] TheXtractor: Vayne best waifu remember everyone!
[4:09:23] Z3r0Fear: only coming back after JP playing league
[4:09:23] KiDtaztic: Ashe <3
[4:09:26] Z3r0Fear: I was free!
[4:09:36] Archangel3003: No Samira or Xayah in those lists.
[4:09:51] ironbacchus: Xayah is in a good spot rn
[4:09:56] drunkencpt: @z3r0fear Garen can work as long as you manage to gap close and got anti poke items and runes. but all in champions top work pretty well against adcs
[4:10:06] Daruvik: PauseChamp
[4:10:11] Disb3liever: chat! we need a fork!
[4:10:14] DerfOnTurf: PauseChamp

[4:10:25] Daruvik: get those Pause Champs out chat
[4:10:26] TheXtractor: To be honest until you reach like high elo it doesnt matter too much which ADC you play. As long as you play it well cohhCheer cohhCheer
[4:10:27] KiDtaztic: Samira is a mix of styles
[4:10:28] DagooX: 🍴
[4:10:28] DerfOnTurf: Which fork will JP select?
[4:10:33] Daruvik: PauseChamp
[4:10:41] CaptainFalkyn: does caitlyn do enough damage these days

[4:10:47] TheXtractor: and even then, just play whats fun
[4:10:49] CaptainFalkyn: last time I played league she had trouble punching through tanks
[4:11:00] Morgaln: How many characters are there now in lol?

[4:12:38] MADCERBERO: nope
[4:12:38] KiDtaztic: @CaptainFalkyn top laner really
[4:12:40] uui23: xayah would be more utility and mobility
[4:12:59] synreir: no lol
[4:13:04] Natjen8: when i play league, i usually have u.gg build for my champion on the other screen
[4:13:08] PunkkiYo: Scam
[4:13:08] TheXtractor: Xayah doesnt have much mobility tho :(
[4:13:11] 0VincentRayne0: Not that one. It probably costs money
[4:13:12] 1TrueTyrant: Nah this type of things werent aroundt when I started, I just stoped after getting diamond 1
[4:13:18] DerfOnTurf: What if I want rank - monkaHmm

[4:14:13] Z3r0Fear: Leona hell yeah!
[4:14:14] Darkaros: MmmHmm JP is eating some food and watching a LoL guide on ADC

[4:14:38] geoffsgayestfan: why are all the ranged supports super anime
[4:14:40] Z3r0Fear: shes my go to support whenever I get that lane
[4:14:41] TheLastSeraphim: No morg on ranged, Sus
[4:15:19] DerfOnTurf: There is a LOL character who isn't super anime?
[4:15:21] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[4:15:26] KiDtaztic: this lulu poppin

[4:16:31] Darkaros: most of this advice is applicable to every moba
[4:16:35] uui23: well this is the same thing in dota
[4:16:35] CaptainFalkyn: it's all about getting better at what you already know
[4:16:38] Darkaros: i.e. useless if you've played most of them
[4:17:06] Kymix: NODDERS
[4:17:16] MADCERBERO: @Darkaros agree but that's why is introduction I guess
[4:17:32] MADCERBERO: cloakSpin cloakSpin
[4:17:35] Darkaros: ya, it's a good guide so far, I like the advice to avoid metas in particular
[4:17:58] KiDtaztic: I hate that
[4:17:59] RlDennis: Yeah, this is good general knowledge for every lane so far

[4:21:12] Barba06: JP did that multiple times today NODDERS

[4:23:10] Kymix: @Sp3nc3r_2k10 you missed the point of when he said that. AFTER the laning phase, the adc is suppose to be mid
[4:23:12] epicshoo: what energy? ijpSUFFER
[4:23:18] Joebeezer: duo time bby

[4:23:57] titanodin: i support main
[4:24:01] DrewGamer: has JP come across any obvious smurfs?
[4:24:04] nevermoreofyore: You can't have that attitude for soloing... you need to be the only factor that matters to climb ladders. Support is just luck over large # of games - you are the stable factor.
[4:24:05] crawds: shangchi is today on disney+?
[4:24:06] Kaddhy_2k10: yeah i was out for a bit.
[4:24:07] hirtza1: correct, if both of you aren't smurfing duoing isn't rly worth it
[4:24:14] CadaverLuke: your best bet is to learn how to get your support to do what you need
[4:24:22] Kaddhy_2k10: crapping
[4:24:25] Joebeezer: lose lane, win game is how I roll
[4:24:40] DerfOnTurf: Win lane lose game PepeHands
[4:24:49] Lindobu: winning 2 lanes is better than stomping 1 YEP

[4:25:20] crawds: also you can rent no time to die on amazon
[4:25:21] DerfOnTurf: I am the friend who sucks PepeHands
[4:25:32] Lindobu: realistically a "good" support should win bot and mid but it's dependant on the midlaner and jungler

[4:31:04] 0VincentRayne0: The odds of getting streamed sniped in silver is insanely low since that’s where the majority of players are.
[4:31:04] hirtza1: chat was getting 2 pots an accident or does he do it every game
[4:31:05] Lindobu: i think there's an overlay to hide the map that makes it foggy everywhere but around you
[4:31:19] MrPogsin: They just need to nerf lux's range tbh
[4:31:21] Hopsinka: u tried played vs xerath ?

[4:31:49] 0VincentRayne0: Lux is fine. If the support was smart they pick either sustain or all in
[4:31:50] DerfOnTurf: FB POGGERS
[4:31:51] Nightshaft25: Gg

[4:34:08] DerfOnTurf: PepoG no tips
[4:34:27] Joebeezer: no tips
[4:34:51] Archangel3003: The most annoying thing about playing against a Lux as well is having to keep moving around erratically to make it harder for her to aim stun  NotLikeThis

[4:36:16] 0VincentRayne0: they have that. @kingnuune
[4:36:34] KingNuune: Yeah but you can only test the champs you own
[4:36:52] slicedjam96: !social

[4:37:02] Lindobu: imagine they even buffed her recently KEKW
[4:37:07] KingNuune: for example, if you want to test Lux and u don have her... good luck knowing her skills and ranges etc
[4:37:11] 0VincentRayne0: Oh. I own every champ. Get a pbe account and there you can.
[4:37:18] Z3r0Fear: my first ever league skin acquired was Riot Girl Tristana I just went and looked and that was back in 2010 lol

[4:40:35] DerfOnTurf: Ollie downloading dogfood porn NODDERS
[4:40:38] Madracah: maplh rly wanted tht kill LUL
[4:40:44] epicshoo: did something auto update?
[4:40:48] 0VincentRayne0: That’s a huge download. Normally it goes up to 300 if someone is downloading
[4:40:52] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:40:59] jamie_marz: gotta love 4 man bot kill the laners then leave?
[4:41:44] 1TrueTyrant: Riots network in NA is insanely good, they went through some insane hoops(deals and laws) with ISPs and the government to make it what it is today.
[4:41:45] Znaggels: You gonna stream the rest of arcane? Was pretty Pog
[4:41:59] Nogardknight: got all the summs
[4:42:00] Joebeezer: and heal
[4:42:07] Darkaros: Nah Riot only let streamers stream ep 1 Znaggels
[4:42:10] Madracah: rly nice ult Placement
[4:42:13] Darkaros: !arcane
[4:42:13] itmeBOT: JP co-streamed Arcane episode 1 and watched episodes 2 and 3 afterward and enjoyed it a lot! He thought it was the best video game adaptation into a TV show etc so far, over stuff like Castelvania/Dota/Witcher.
[4:42:19] 0VincentRayne0: Got flash and heal
[4:42:19] Joebeezer: this cho is doing well i think
[4:42:35] Joebeezer: spoke too soon LUL
[4:42:37] Joebeezer: my bad
[4:42:46] codywithcats: JP League stream is perfect for studying with this music.
[4:42:50] RlDennis: LUL
[4:42:52] TrafficShark: LUL
[4:42:54] DagooX: yikes
[4:42:54] kitcheM: was it really an adaptation though if Riot themselves made the show lol
[4:43:03] 0VincentRayne0: Cho got greedy with no hp
[4:43:15] Joebeezer: playing against lux without an escape is rough
[4:43:16] DerfOnTurf: Fuck Lux NODDERS
[4:43:27] 1TrueTyrant: Yeah cho support is.. suboptimal
[4:43:30] KiDisaster: as someone who mained lux when i played this game that is the correct response to lux imo
[4:43:32] DrewGamer: @0VincentRayne0 yeah that dive was no bueno. he took more than half his hp from the tower
[4:43:36] 0VincentRayne0: I wish I’d go against a lux supp in my games LUL
[4:44:25] 0VincentRayne0: If you see a lux then go Lucian and poop on her
[4:44:37] TasPlays: Scorch clutching
[4:44:39] SixPointFive: 2 spells
[4:44:42] afreak10: ppCrazy ppCrazy Ping
[4:44:56] Gank4CE1: she's fed tho
[4:44:57] 1TrueTyrant: The best way to wade through low elo is to be a selfish bastard and drop dead weights when necessary, cause if you rely on them they will most likely fail you at critical times LUL
[4:45:02] Darkaros: Just think of it as a Lion support (...with low CD) :)
[4:45:03] Inskipp: supports are the new carries
[4:45:05] Tygaeris: I'm a healer... but... *cocks gun*
[4:45:17] MetalcoreWolf: She's a support?
[4:45:22] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[4:45:25] 0VincentRayne0: Well lux is a burst mage. Just happens to be in the support role
[4:45:28] Archangel3003: Isn't there an AD item with a spell shield or something? Hexdrinker isn't it?
[4:45:29] afreak10: LUL
[4:45:34] HmniKadoza: KEKW
[4:45:37] Archangel3003: It's got mr and spell shield iir
[4:45:42] Delmentor: dont you know by now they made the adc role into the support role
[4:45:42] DezartIII: Idk, I think Lux wasn't designed as a support, she is just used as one. What items does she have?
[4:45:47] Joebeezer: COPIUM
[4:45:49] UAjech: @Archangel3003 edge of night i think
[4:45:50] Z3r0Fear: that guy
[4:45:51] DrewGamer: shame, cause I thought you did pretty well this game JP :(
[4:45:54] Z3r0Fear: that 1 guy
[4:46:21] Archangel3003: @jeffcnewdles I think that's the other one but there's also the Hexdrinker I'm sure
[4:46:23] 0VincentRayne0: His team got rekt, unfortunately. Looks like my games. Win lane lose game
[4:46:26] crawds: arcane next episode is next saturday?
[4:46:28] Lindobu: @DezartVn that's most supports in the meta right now KEKW
[4:46:39] DrewGamer: @crawds this coming saturday yeah
[4:46:46] Lindobu: veigar xerath vex even bran was a midlaner originally
[4:46:51] Joebeezer: lux top
[4:46:55] 0VincentRayne0: Damage supports win lane phase but utility supports win games.
[4:47:31] 0VincentRayne0: I’d like to introduce jp to Yone, that new adc and the wraith king
[4:47:40] Madracah: lux is both though.
[4:47:43] Lindobu: @0VincentRayne0 not necessarily cause the most utility you need is cc and wards which damage supports do
[4:47:45] Nathanisms: cho gath support wins nothing though
[4:48:04] DezartIII: Lux supp easy plat NODDERS
[4:48:14] baabaacow1: low elo damage supports get fed enough to turn into carries
[4:48:21] Viriskali15: is lux still viable mid?
[4:48:31] Viriskali15: or is she solely support?
[4:48:33] Nathanisms: @Viriskali15 Ye they buffed her recently
[4:48:39] 0VincentRayne0: Damage supports normally don’t have the ability to carry an entire team or buffer mistakes the team makes
[4:48:49] Lindobu: neither do utility supports tho
[4:49:08] Archangel3003: We need to stop calling them support and call them what they are. People who wanted mid but got stuck filling support role lol
[4:49:11] 0VincentRayne0: Damage supports HAVE to be ahead to do well. Utility supports are viable no matter what
[4:49:15] Nathanisms: im leveling an account to play support because im sick of how JP feels
[4:49:19] DagooX: Kappa
[4:49:19] Lindobu: actually it's the opposite damage supports can cover for lacking damage from the team
[4:49:24] 1TrueTyrant: @Archangel3003 Ding ding ding
[4:49:29] afreak10: cohhSuffer
[4:49:29] flamegod18: I am in bronze 2
[4:49:49] hrunting13: where can you see his rank?
[4:49:53] 0VincentRayne0: I have won way more games as support nami and soraka than as zyra and lux
[4:50:00] Cardsharp: hey JP and chat!
[4:50:00] 1TrueTyrant: @Archangel3003 Hence why you need to be selfish af in low elo, hoard all the gold and carry everyone on your back
[4:50:13] Viriskali15: lol
[4:50:13] flamegod18: yeah almost bronze 1 but I play lisandra mid so
[4:50:15] epicshoo: D:
[4:50:23] Darkaros: MmmHmm
[4:50:27] Inskipp: Inskipp subscribed with Prime. 
[4:50:27] itmeBOT: Welcome to itmeNATION Inskipp ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[4:50:28] Viriskali15: ive really been enjoying cassiopeia lately
[4:50:28] Sir_Dakk: The ups and downs of mobas is crazy. I personally cant handle the downs and I go full PJ. So I just avoid it.
[4:50:33] Darkaros: Just stay calm and listen to lofi
[4:50:35] izzyiv: monkaHmm im not slow.
[4:50:38] Lindobu: @0VincentRayne0 it's really up to the team man like i get what you mean but it's hard for a damage support to be behind when they can freely harass and therefor get an advantage
[4:50:42] crawds: Aram is heaven
[4:50:43] Altair900: CrungoCycle CATBEDOINGTHELAUNDRY
[4:50:50] ReginaldXIV: You will never experience the highs and lows of high school football
[4:50:52] Nathanisms: I hate solo q ADC it feels so horrible
[4:51:32] Sonatta: i'm just farming praetorum for more moggle dollars monkaSHAKE
[4:51:35] epicshoo: swain support monkaS
[4:51:47] Lindobu: @Nathanisms i became a jungler cause i couldn't take solo support or adc KEKW
[4:51:53] 0VincentRayne0: Swain support should be strong in this elo
[4:52:02] Nurama: swain + draven is OP
[4:52:06] Gank4CE1: Branned? KEKHeim
[4:52:07] 0VincentRayne0: Easy and free catch ability
[4:52:10] Nathanisms: @Lindobu Im really trying to find where I fit, but I suck at jungling
[4:52:19] Nurama: draven can land his E so easily it allowed swain to pull back basically whenever and then land his own E
[4:52:19] dralathan: if they can hit abilities swain is busted. I have no faith in swain supp to hit anything
[4:52:27] HmniKadoza: KEKHeim
[4:52:53] 0VincentRayne0: Their team is scary right now
[4:52:53] epicshoo: oof xerath OMEGALUL
[4:52:53] Viriskali15: xerath's range is insame
[4:53:03] Lindobu: @Nathanisms if you're an adc main you can try apc in mid
[4:53:07] AnorienNightwish: wait i can only bind "a- move" to left click? ijpWTF
[4:53:16] Baludor: Ban Lux and they pick a Xerath LUL
[4:53:16] Joebeezer: I wish there was a league classic. I want to play old ap sion again
[4:53:25] Baludor: There's no winning
[4:53:30] Infidel_Art: LUL
[4:53:33] reminkly: nasus is the true pve experience
[4:53:36] Lindobu: KEKW
[4:53:39] Nathanisms: @Lindobu Maybe, but was always put off that because id get secondary role
[4:53:41] Nogardknight: sit on your top island then run up and Q the enemy tank for 3/4 of their HP
[4:53:47] Steeltooth493: Ban Xerath and they pick a Lux LUL
[4:53:48] Gank4CE1: leave Susan alone
[4:53:51] Knight978: woah why u taking shots at lost ark
[4:53:58] reminkly: there really is a ton of enjoyment of 1 shotting the enemy ADC w/ your Q
[4:54:01] fraggleroctv: i think grappling with the variables in bot lane can make one lose interest in the game fast
[4:54:03] epicshoo: that kaisa skin name monkaS
[4:54:13] Nurama: @Joebeezer I want to play old swain
[4:54:16] reminkly: @epicshoo Vayne's prestige skin is longer lol
[4:54:20] Joebeezer: @Nurama same
[4:54:22] Darkaros: Nah JP liked Lost Ark. Like he LIKES his odds to win in this prediction! COPIUM
[4:54:31] DerfOnTurf: Lost Ark = a lorean mmo is a shot at lost ark monkaHmm
[4:54:31] Joebeezer: shit was fun
[4:54:59] 0VincentRayne0: But lost ark is only on beta. You lose progress after it ends don’t you?
[4:55:18] Darkaros: yes
[4:55:18] CorporalPibb: I feel like the riot mmorpg might be top down like Lost Ark
[4:55:28] PunkkiYo: Nasus loses all stacks when game is over
[4:55:31] bxckwrds: You forgot your trinket ward
[4:55:33] KingNuune: Did they have release date for lost ark?
[4:55:36] Red_Jar: Apologies if you've answered before, but why 2 potions instead of 3 or a refillable?
[4:55:37] bxckwrds: Oh nvm
[4:55:40] bxckwrds: I’m dumb
[4:55:56] bxckwrds: Have mercy, I’m mobile user
[4:56:00] Nathanisms: you can not "buy" the ward
[4:56:05] Nathanisms: but when you leave base gates
[4:56:07] Nathanisms: it gives it you anyway
[4:56:09] 0VincentRayne0: Potions give more hp and have more survivability when getting bursted down
[4:56:14] RlDennis: Can't you sell refillable for 80 gold back though? something likkke that no?
[4:56:20] reminkly: you used to have to get the trinket and the auto thing was because so many people didn't remember lol
[4:56:30] wagah: @itmeJP because of you igot back into League
[4:56:41] wagah: @itmeJP been playing sett alot

[4:57:20] Ikarit: chill soloq music is awesome jp! whats the playlist called?
[4:57:30] RlDennis: I don't really get refillable all that often myself. rooDerp
[4:57:50] DemonSamurai: @Ikarit i think he said it was Riot's chillhop or lofi playlist
[4:57:53] Ikarit: RlDennis ohai! cohhFA (me neither. 3 pots and im g2g)
[4:58:04] NixFinn: Last hitting is so annoying

[4:59:07] Kymix: There was a fun duo i saw on reddit recently, it was trundle + Swain bot
[4:59:24] 0VincentRayne0: Swain didn’t watch the video
[4:59:31] 0VincentRayne0: Keeps going far ahead of adc
[4:59:33] DagooX: got low hp and tries to go aggro
[4:59:35] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[5:00:00] Nogardknight: uh?
