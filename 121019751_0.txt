[6:59:21] ArchaicOne: @thereisnoishmael, how do you figure, if you increase the cooldown on her dash, reduce the heal, reduce the true damage, and maybe make the slow something lower than 90%

[7:01:41] Barney_stinson95: @Irrelevant_Inspector Mobility to dodge , armor pen ult counter her passive
[7:01:53] ArchaicOne: @thereisnoishmael, you cant just reduce basic damage, you need to hit harder than that but not gut the champ because i think she is fun to watch
[7:01:54] Eliezer992: EA SPORT
[7:02:14] armroselund: 1567
[7:02:20] ArchaicOne: @thereisnoishmael, you can dash through her to dodge the stun i do believe
[7:02:24] thereisnoishmael: @ArchaicOne which is why i said just removing the true damage and changing what the second proc of her Q does would be the best
[7:02:36] tommykapow: dorans blade > biscuit
[7:02:52] Barney_stinson95: you can E camille to dodge her stun
[7:02:57] hundr3dsna: Camille three items now SeemsGood
[7:02:58] thereisnoishmael: having a 3 second Q true damage proc'd by sheem is absurd
[7:03:05] thereisnoishmael: sheen*
[7:03:08] tommykapow: +
[7:03:11] irrelevant_inspector: @Barney_stinson95, I'll try the matchup but the ult doesn't really counter her passive at all. Idk if the ability to dodge means too much because he's so much squishier
[7:03:18] SwampRSG: Goon squad BrokeBack
[7:03:18] thereisnoishmael: dodging camile stun yasuo will still lose lol

[7:03:55] Barney_stinson95: @Irrelevant_Inspector that why i said pre nerf Yasuo . current Yas lose
[7:04:01] ArchaicOne: @thereisnoishmael, i think that would gut her to get rid of her truedamage, possibly destroy her base health and resistances

[7:04:29] thereisnoishmael: removing the true damage would definitely not gut her, it would just make her mcuh less OP
[7:04:31] Pondi1900: gg
[7:04:35] Sitro28: Illaoi on release, Malzahar jungle after rework, Camille on release, Rengar after minirework. Why isn't the balancing team not fired yet? NotLikeThis

[7:04:40] BoiKami: camille broken asfuck yooo rito plz
[7:04:43] Barney_stinson95: @thereisnoishmael yon don't just dodge her stun you can also dodge her q and w
[7:04:45] goodasgoldman: bengi is the next cn marin
[7:04:48] ArchaicOne: @thereisnoishmael, because she is an offtank and an assassin at the same time
[7:04:54] cavalRy7: PICK SINGED GUYS ITS COUNTER FOR CAMILLE Kappa
[7:05:00] thereisnoishmael: her q is an autoattack how do you dodge that?
[7:05:05] shinamon345: how can you dodge a auto attack pvmanNOO
[7:05:05] irrelevant_inspector: @Barney_stinson95, The most recent nerf? It wasn't too bad. The last nerf was ages ago iirc. Either way Yasuo needs extended trades which he isn't going to win against Camille
[7:05:06] Eliezer992: Citro√´n Creative Technology Kreygasm Kreygasm
[7:05:37] Barney_stinson95: @thereisnoishmael buy keeping your distance till her q on cd
[7:05:46] goblinguy01: Wow.
[7:05:59] thereisnoishmael: keeping your distance from a camille lul
[7:06:07] irrelevant_inspector: Her Q isn't going to go on CD if you keep your distance
[7:06:11] ArchaicOne: i will say that is a joke
[7:06:27] Barney_stinson95: @Irrelevant_Inspector tanksuo can beat her
[7:06:42] Barney_stinson95: @Irrelevant_Inspector her 2nd Q
[7:06:43] thereisnoishmael: are you talking full item build camille vs yasuo or lvl 3 or what
[7:06:49] fps1r: LUL
[7:06:49] BoiKami: ekko > camille i think
[7:07:02] thereisnoishmael: you can oonly dash once thru a champ every like 6+ seconds thats not helpful in a 1v1
[7:07:05] ArchaicOne: Camille has no good counter
[7:07:19] ArchaicOne: just play tanks that scale well even if *** on
[7:07:21] irrelevant_inspector: She won't use Q unless she trades with you
[7:07:28] ArchaicOne: mao and shen
[7:07:35] Barney_stinson95: @thereisnoishmael of course you need to fight her with minions around you
[7:07:45] Ï∫îÎîîÏò§Îπ†: "Im easily put out" anyone let me know what is this mean.
[7:08:05] Barney_stinson95: @Irrelevant_Inspector then force her to trade , E Q E back
[7:08:09] shinamon345: unless you like destroy her like 5 kills camile would just kill all your teammates :o
[7:08:09] Filoom: froskurin already in LCK i think
[7:08:24] thereisnoishmael: lol its ridiculous to say yasuo could beat camille at any stage
[7:08:26] BlazingHigh: Benchi LUL BrokeBack
[7:08:27] LeckoTUT: Did QG WIN?
[7:08:49] thereisnoishmael: if it was so simple why wouldn't any pro region consider using yasuo into her..

[7:09:07] irrelevant_inspector: @Barney_stinson95, Sorry dude, I'm just not seeing it. Yasuo isn't designed to be strong against a champion like Camille.
[7:09:08] Ë±ÜÈ†ÅË±ÜÈ†ÅÁ±≥ÂàÜÁ±≥ÂàÜ: godtoneSa 26
[7:09:28] ArchaicOne: @thereisnoishmael, would you agree that there is no good counter to camille in her current state?
[7:09:29] Barney_stinson95: @thereisnoishmael because yasuo get nerf . try to imagine Tanksuo pre nerf
[7:09:30] thereisnoishmael: yasuo is best against champs he can abuse windwall with
[7:09:41] Hsisbetterthanlol: rammus is camille counter IMO
[7:09:49] thereisnoishmael: there is very clearly no good counter to camille yeah
[7:10:03] thereisnoishmael: true damage > rammus armor
[7:10:10] Barney_stinson95: Yasuo also have a shield

[7:10:53] AstrosEdge: i just play poppy against camille, it's a free win every time
[7:10:57] thereisnoishmael: @mesquka ?
[7:10:59] QuokkaOfTheChat: Pro tip: Spin to win, I GAREN-tee it
[7:11:07] polohippoday: Alistar top against Camille?
[7:11:14] QuokkaOfTheChat: @thereisnoishmael, Kappa
[7:11:24] ArchaicOne: @thereisnoishmael, i think if you are letting camille through the only real answer is a support tank
[7:12:11] thereisnoishmael: well yeah, only a tank champ could possibly deal with her
[7:12:12] Barney_stinson95: @Irrelevant_Inspector ok maybe not early . but full dmg armpen late game
[7:12:15] Maceth: sharapova Kreygasm
[7:12:18] thereisnoishmael: lmao maria sharapova reference in 2017?
[7:12:19] SwampRSG: Sharapova Kreygasm
[7:12:20] AstrosEdge: camille sucks, just play poppy or darius against her and take the free win
[7:12:25] shinamon345: I think you guys all forget the URGOD ULTIMATE COUNTER FOR CAMILE pvmanMonkey pvmanMonkey
[7:12:31] QuokkaOfTheChat: Play Fiora into Camille
[7:12:43] ArchaicOne: @DadRockRadio, are you in bronze?
[7:12:51] Barney_stinson95: triforce Frozen tanksuo can beat her mid game but lose in both early and late
[7:13:03] AstrosEdge: @ArchaicOne d2
[7:13:20] thereisnoishmael: if cammille and yasuo have the exact same items camille wins 100% of the time lol
[7:13:53] ArchaicOne: @DadRockRadio, and solo q is also very different
[7:14:03] AstrosEdge: yea yea, what's your rank
[7:14:21] Barney_stinson95: @thereisnoishmael you mean same items as in 6 items or exactly same items ?
[7:14:22] ArchaicOne: @DadRockRadio, d4 soo not far from you
[7:14:28] AstrosEdge: yea ok "not far"
[7:14:33] thereisnoishmael: same items 1-6
[7:14:49] thereisnoishmael: so like camille tri force fg vs yasuo tri force fg
[7:14:56] shinamon345: I am challenger 2 bla bla bla Keepo
[7:15:02] ArchaicOne: @DadRockRadio, also lets be real there are far better players than us
