[2:49:17] reminkly: you are the queen of bilgewater, yes
[2:49:17] Jukettaja: Must be worth a fortune

[2:49:41] AnnieJella: Almost
[2:49:54] Marc326: RUINED
[2:49:59] Late2thegam3: is there a command for background on this game or should I google?

[2:50:02] m3rcer: there is an auto convo continue option if u want
[2:50:03] Darkaros: YAPPP "and now we're doing diplomacy" was the dialogue you missed
[2:50:04] yrvengalied: except some small parts @itmeJP its all voiced like the MS and some Quest
[2:50:06] Onefootstout: sarah
[2:50:08] Norrak1: original cast and some new VA, all fantastic. half is from CR
[2:50:12] Twizzlar: @ファ労苦 oh ok, thought he was already established for a bit
[2:50:14] AnnieJella: @m3rcer I think thats on by default
[2:50:22] m3rcer: @andyfjell supposed to be yeah
[2:50:22] Darkaros: Late2thegam3 Just the LoL lore in general but it intros the basics by itself, no need for external info

[2:50:52] Mrshilka: looks good
[2:50:58] Mrshilka: great animations
[2:51:08] JimB0b0: Yeah, that's why controller
[2:51:14] RandoMMizatioN: this reminds me of Battle chasers style
[2:51:15] ファ労苦: @Twizzlar, gp as a character existed but they reworked him with a new kit, and no one played that kit beforehand
[2:51:20] Darkaros: ahh, obligatory witcher sense
[2:51:27] WilliamKurokami: do you have the deluxe edition JP? if so there's a chest with potions in your inventory you wanna open
[2:51:33] Ichigeki1: 100% watch the tutorials, the game has some weird shit
[2:51:50] GamerPT: looks really good
[2:52:06] cuetreepie: Is there more than one story in this game?
[2:52:10] Ichigeki1: yes
[2:52:20] Gliverz: doesnt look like miss fortune, no gundam suit
[2:52:21] yrvengalied: Battle Chasers was an amazing game that fell under the radar but this might get the Dev in the spot light
[2:52:24] Ichigeki1: tab is inventory
[2:52:35] m3rcer: i dont think he can access that menu yet
[2:52:36] JimB0b0: start button
[2:52:36] JaseLeland: yeah, I liked battle chasers as well
[2:52:36] WilliamKurokami: you can access the inventory later
[2:52:39] JimB0b0: for inventory
[2:52:45] 4head_4weird: KEKW
[2:52:45] Ichigeki1: idk what it is for controller
[2:52:45] epicshoo: tab on your controller! Pepega
[2:52:47] Darkaros: (he's on controller)
[2:52:49] yrvengalied: inventory will show later
[2:52:54] m3rcer: he needs to be out of tutorial for inventory
[2:52:55] LinearkNT: peepoGiggles

[2:53:11] WilliamKurokami: yeah, I was a bit early on that my bad
[2:53:13] yrvengalied: D:
[2:53:19] JimB0b0: You can't do inventory till after this section
[2:53:25] Zaelsus: Parlay!
[2:53:47] JimB0b0: Lots of space in that chest for some bullets
[2:53:48] Onefootstout: should probably take those bullets out
[2:53:48] SzybkiLopez86: Gankplank is dead?
[2:53:54] Reijm11: those bullets would poison you over time
[2:53:59] Zaelsus: PepeLaugh
[2:54:00] Darkaros: Gangplank is dead NODDERS
[2:54:00] pc2400: he will respawn
[2:54:03] Ozoaken: the guns were made by Miss fortunes parents for Gangplank he killed them and destroyed the pistols and she repaired them and uses them
[2:54:06] Twizzlar: well, she's quite prodigious
[2:54:06] Mrshilka: if they are made of lead yes
[2:54:10] Maradum: Half of critrole cast in this one aswell, voice acting is really nice
[2:54:14] Jukettaja: Oh yeah Gangplank is Matthew Mercer. I forgot
[2:54:23] Jukettaja: Despite playing him so much.
[2:54:23] Caruda: they are hyping up gangplank
[2:54:27] JimB0b0: They are split
[2:54:33] Onefootstout: f gangplank
[2:54:38] AnnieJella: Sadge
[2:54:42] SzybkiLopez86: When i play lol i main him and Nasus
[2:54:42] SEye6: But gankplank has all the lemons
[2:54:49] AnnieJella: He just wanted to be a dictator
[2:54:50] LinearkNT: ijpCOMFY
[2:54:54] birkhoms: because GP is one of the oldest and cooles chars and gets way too little love
[2:55:02] Jukettaja: Can you shoot those people?
[2:55:03] Ichigeki1: it does
[2:55:09] GeneralBun: The game takes place shortly after he died I think.
[2:55:10] hollysephiroth: I hate when games take long to show me gameplay
[2:55:13] m3rcer: until you get 3 party members imo yeah
[2:55:16] MrDigitalCypher: Who the fuck is Gangplank? and why does POe looks so colorful?
[2:55:19] Jukettaja: They don't die though
[2:55:19] Gliverz: remember the times, when gankplank could shoot your own minions? :D
[2:55:32] itsJprof: myeah, maybe about an hour or 2 i'd say
[2:55:34] raptorscream: is this an rgp?
[2:55:41] iskavan1: confirmed, JP hates oranges because he hates gangplank
[2:55:41] Archangel3003: @hollysephiroth It's coming up soon ijpHAPPY
[2:55:49] Flyspeck42: nice hat sam

[2:57:34] Archangel3003: !arcane @marcopolul
[2:57:34] itmeBOT: JP has watched up to Arcane Act II (NOT Act III yet) and has enjoyed it a lot! He thinks it's the best video game adaptation into a TV show etc so far, over stuff like Castelvania/Dota/Witcher, and would recommend it to people who haven't experienced League of Legends at all.
[2:57:38] yrvengalied: @MarcoPoLUL no spoilers in chat please as JP still didnt watch it yet

[3:00:47] Archangel3003: @darkaros Yeah the game is a bit overwhelming at times and some things are a bit clunky. I've still been enjoying it though as the art style, music and voice acting carry it.

[3:04:07] Ichigeki1: look down
[3:04:08] JimB0b0: triggers
[3:04:17] yrvengalied: SICK
[3:04:22] Ichigeki1: no
[3:04:23] Darkaros: Nerfed yourself for no reason with that Lane change JP
[3:04:27] yrvengalied: Nope
[3:04:28] m3rcer: that was poison debuff when she hit u earlier
[3:04:32] Vivilde: her attack poisoned you
[3:04:34] yrvengalied: from the daggers
[3:04:35] JimB0b0: @Darkaros he had to remove the bomb
[3:04:42] SkylerKK: skylerkk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! How you liking it?
[3:04:42] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing skylerkk! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:04:45] Darkaros: Oh ya, the bomb
[3:04:51] Zaelsus: Dirty knife poisoned you
[3:04:56] Ichigeki1: the ui for this game isnt the greatest, its hard to know who has what buffs/debuffs
[3:05:15] AnnieJella: ItsBoshyTime @itmeJP Remember to save ItsBoshyTime
[3:05:42] Pistollero1: These mechanics are wild im so lost
[3:06:02] m3rcer: i mean its just cast fast, normal or slow really
[3:06:10] DrewGamer: @Ichigeki1 the buffs/debuffs are next to each character's portrait. Once you learn what each icon is it's a quick glance (before that you can "examine" the buffs/debuffs).
[3:06:10] Vivilde: basically make sure you don't have your turn inside the red box
[3:06:11] Reifuu: Feels like a card game at some points.
[3:06:12] yrvengalied: you can speed up the combat speed with RB
[3:06:39] SirSamVimes: This game has some of the best turn based combat I've ever experienced.
[3:06:41] Darkaros: ijpHMM I thought I understood it, then I didn't
[3:06:43] Ichigeki1: @Ichigeki1 i know where they are, but it never tells you what the debuffs are, not even a small popup tooltip which for an rpg is like, p bad lol
[3:06:47] Flyspeck42: SPEEDERS
[3:06:48] yrvengalied: LUL
[3:06:52] Reifuu: you can't speed lane the basic attack
[3:06:53] SlipCrit: Speeders
[3:06:53] AnnieJella: SPEEDERS
[3:06:56] boki_86: i think it is weaker on the speed lane
[3:06:59] Darkaros: SPEEDERS STEERING
[3:06:59] SirSamVimes: @Ichigeki1 that's what inspect mode is for
[3:07:03] aetralos: @itmeJP can you PARLAY though Kappa LUL
[3:07:05] wagah: really like the art style
[3:07:09] Ichigeki1: thats a poor game choice
[3:07:10] Ichigeki1: tbh
[3:07:17] yrvengalied: This game will be crazy for speedrunning
[3:07:21] Darkaros: LUL
[3:07:23] yrvengalied: like Battle Chasers
[3:07:25] boki_86: @Ichigeki1 how so?
[3:07:26] Ichigeki1: if i hover over a debfuff or buff, it should have a tooltip lol
[3:07:29] yrvengalied: ijpLAUGH
[3:07:37] jeffhunter12: @Ichigeki1 you can inspect them with y
[3:07:38] sarqon: does JP publish his thoughts/reviews about games anywhere? am interested what he thinks about this one
[3:07:50] Darkaros: Guys he just started the game LUL
[3:07:54] AnnieJella: @sarqon he only just started
[3:07:56] sarqon: oh
[3:07:59] sarqon: nvm then
[3:08:02] Nicrodk: Nicrodk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 79 months, currently on a 79 month streak! woopsLurk
[3:08:02] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Nicrodk! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:08:13] yrvengalied: @Darkaros JP's aim in this is the same as the BF2042 clip today ijpLAUGH
[3:08:16] sarqon: thanks
[3:08:19] Darkaros: That being said we usually make Thoughts videos / clips, and ya JP informally reviews it during Dropped Frames
[3:08:20] epicshoo: YAPPP SingsMic how do you feel about the first 5 minutes of this game?
[3:08:32] Flyspeck42: ratJAM
[3:08:39] AinzN: epicshoo ijpREPORT
[3:08:53] AnnieJella: YAPPP Would you say pressing new game was a 10/10 experience?
[3:09:04] DrewGamer: @epicshoo I feel its a turn-based game with a league of legends theme cohhK
[3:09:09] m3rcer: up/down for other members
[3:09:16] jeffhunter12: you got potions
[3:09:19] iskavan1: JP at half health monkaW
[3:09:22] Reifuu: You can still use potions, up on dpad
[3:09:32] m3rcer: you can pot during combat but it is an action
[3:10:08] SirSamVimes: I really like how much strategic depth the lanes/hazards on the initiative bar add.
[3:10:15] xelan_star: if needed use healing pots but they will use your turn
[3:10:17] melzornos: hey, how do you do the second pylon in vault of vesani?
[3:10:21] DrewGamer: @m3rcer Do potions have a cast/recovery time?
[3:10:24] Reifuu: I love the combat system
[3:10:29] SirSamVimes: @DrewGamer they cost an action, but are instant
[3:10:37] m3rcer: @DrewGamer same as instant
[3:10:39] yrvengalied: just wait till the real stuff get in it will be crazier JP
[3:10:45] yrvengalied: if its like Battle Chasers
[3:10:48] yrvengalied: and better
[3:10:54] Darkaros: We have just started this game, for newcomers LUL
[3:11:05] ryukenchi: is this also free ?
[3:11:08] xelan_star: this game came out of nowhere - atleast I had not heard anything about it
[3:11:12] Flyspeck42: @ryukenchi no
[3:11:17] DrewGamer: Combat is really cool. Can't believe I never heard of Battle Chasers.
[3:11:18] Reifuu: @yrvengalied It's samish on the surface level but the whole lane system totally changes the combat
[3:11:22] Flyspeck42: $30 iirc
[3:11:24] Vivilde: @ryukenchi 30 buckaroos
[3:11:29] ryukenchi: ah ok
[3:11:41] Darkaros: ijpNOPERS I don't
[3:11:41] Reifuu: Btw, headsup. The music in this game is good
[3:11:48] nochejunior: it does look like Battle Chasers, probably made by the same guys
[3:11:53] ZeoBishop: ijpNOPERS
[3:11:55] Darkaros: It is!
[3:11:59] Reifuu: @nochejunior ye, airship syndicatwe
[3:12:03] m3rcer: if u dont want the chance to miss
[3:12:10] SirSamVimes: made by airship syndicate, published by riot forge
[3:12:12] Mysticryu: Ohh, that makes sense now
[3:12:15] ranin: but does it have the battle victory song from ff games?
[3:12:17] SirSamVimes: it's a really strong first showing for the publisher
[3:12:23] Archangel3003: Only if they have that buff thing. You can check by inspecting them
[3:12:26] m3rcer: you can just cast in balance lane but its smol chance to miss
[3:12:40] LinearkNT: It's definitely fun
[3:12:44] yrvengalied: @Reifuu that is why i assumed it will be crazier, i want to play this now so bad after seeing this
[3:12:53] DrewGamer: @ranin I don't think so, but the music is quite enjoyable nonetheless :P
[3:13:08] WilliamKurokami: it depends on the enemy buffs. some buffs are removed via fast lane, others via power lane and another buff via aoe attacks
[3:13:13] WDForty: how far's JP into the game so far chat?
[3:13:14] LinearkNT: Oh Illaoi ain't no support
[3:13:16] Necoc: Sarah Fortune is her name?
[3:13:20] Reifuu: @WDForty 15mins
[3:13:25] WDForty: thanks
[3:13:25] G1ku: illaoi is top lane bruiser
[3:13:30] eLMaQ: top
[3:13:31] Archangel3003: She's a top lane mostly
[3:13:31] iskavan1: doesnt she top lane tood?
[3:13:46] SirSamVimes: illaoi exists to bait enemies into ganking her and 3v1 them when they're too dumb to run out of her ult
[3:13:48] yrvengalied: both games has really good VA
[3:13:49] SirSamVimes: she's great
[3:13:58] DrewGamer: Totally worth the $30 if you enjoy turn-based games. Doubly so if you're a fan of League of Legends.
[3:14:08] yrvengalied: monkaS
[3:14:13] Flyspeck42: we hentai now
[3:14:22] GeekInUndies: coxWiggle peepoClap
[3:14:23] yrvengalied: ijp7
[3:14:25] SirSamVimes: It seems that as well as giving them the funding to make the game, Riot gives their Riot Forge pals access to their voice actor stable for the characters
[3:14:33] SirSamVimes: Because that's definitely Illaoi's LoL VA
[3:14:48] CadaverLuke: i love Illaoi. such a chadlass
[3:14:52] jeffhunter12: itd be dumb if they didnt let the actual VA be used
[3:14:57] DrewGamer: @SirSamVimes are all the characters voiced by their game actors? It definitely seems so.
[3:15:09] Lethyzs: Wow BFA?! Pog
[3:15:11] Scout_6613: that's a lotta woman
[3:15:14] SirSamVimes: @DrewGamer All except MF.
[3:15:15] yrvengalied: are we gonna try each character alone?! i like this new take
[3:15:16] Saxmachine904: MF is Laura Bailey
[3:15:28] Secret_Berzerker: does the artwork look like Torchlight ?
[3:15:29] La_Fourmi: yeah she surprised me in this game
[3:15:48] CadaverLuke: some badass female leads in this game it seems, very cool
[3:15:49] Reifuu: Damn stinky paylangi
[3:15:51] DrewGamer: Ah ok cool, well I still think she did a great job then as MF.
[3:15:51] Norrak1: @drewgamer No all, Illaoi is a new VA
[3:15:52] iskavan1: I heard the other day JP said he wanted to play top lane, peepoGiggles
[3:15:53] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:15:58] Norrak1: and a damn good one at that
[3:16:00] bairdman: Illaoi is a pretty cool champ imo, shame meta doesnt favor her much
[3:16:04] KAHVITEK: these forge games really makes me hyped for the mmo
[3:16:05] Archangel3003: I like the character better now but still hate laning against her and her tentacles
[3:16:15] frost21x3: just finished watching Arcane act 3, just wow
[3:16:18] Onefootstout: role: everything
[3:16:18] bairdman: lots of heals, can 2v1 in top lane most time
[3:16:25] DrewGamer: @Norrak1 I think all the voice actors did a great job (at least the ones for the playable characters.
[3:16:31] aetralos: sadge
[3:16:45] Fuji_5: She smashes things with her huge bowling ball golden idol
[3:17:18] Jukettaja: Ooh Manamune
[3:17:19] ftwNatsu: so basically tank healer and dps in one character, seems legit
[3:17:30] Jukettaja: Wait, how do you have that already?
[3:17:37] Reifuu: There are some
[3:17:37] Sstargamer: looks like
[3:17:40] yrvengalied: prbably ?
[3:17:41] n1rri: Yep!
[3:17:42] Maradum: As a turn based fan I really enjoy the gameplay. Has a lot of nice tweeks and specials that are more than just base turn based stuff
[3:17:42] wagah: i believe so
[3:17:43] Fuji_5: yes items from the game
[3:17:44] WilliamKurokami: okay, you have the deluxe edition
[3:17:44] Norrak1: many yes
[3:17:46] Archangel3003: That means you have the Deluxe Edition if you have the Manamune @itmeJP  Also yes it does
[3:17:50] Norrak1: and some unique stuff
[3:17:51] KAHVITEK: I think the Manamune was preorder bonus?
[3:17:53] bairdman: yeah some are in there, doran's set
[3:17:55] Jukettaja: That's worth at least 2900 gold
[3:17:59] Shazeio7: Items from the game are in the game... yes kastacHmm
[3:18:01] SirSamVimes: manamume isn't deluxe, but those trinkets are.
[3:18:02] yrvengalied: LUL
[3:18:03] WilliamKurokami: that's the chest I meant
[3:18:04] CadaverLuke: i wonder how much easier deluxe edition makes this
[3:18:05] Reifuu: manamune was "buy before date x and get it"
[3:18:05] DrewGamer: @Jukettaja ITs from being an early adopter. If you bought the game within the first week it launched or something like that.
[3:18:06] frost21x3: @ftwNatsu or Lee Sin, for short
[3:18:07] SirSamVimes: manamune is just if you buy before a certain date
[3:18:07] yrvengalied: that sound LUL
[3:18:19] Jukettaja: @Jukettaja aaahh
[3:18:31] WilliamKurokami: I played for like 5 hours until i realized I had that chest KEKHeim
[3:18:41] thrillhouse451: Is this on gamepass?
[3:18:42] Onefootstout: Pog
[3:18:46] epicshoo: PepegaPls
[3:18:48] m3rcer: yeah changing gear affect the model ingame
[3:18:54] SirSamVimes: unique models for weapons is very poggers
[3:18:56] Jukettaja: That would imply we get skins too
[3:19:01] jeffhunter12: we worship the poro gods now
[3:19:01] samael_40k: check the skins
[3:19:04] WilliamKurokami: you also got ruined skins for everyone JP
[3:19:08] DarkShadowRogue: I think the poro might take away the impact hobbLUL
[3:19:12] DejaDrew: How is this game?
[3:19:14] Buttzyy: where can you get this game from

[3:21:07] WDForty: coxSeafood coxWiggle

[3:21:46] Reifuu: @m3rcer my man
[3:21:48] WilliamKurokami: can get more later on though
[3:21:51] samael_40k: 5 and can increase it to 6
[3:21:52] m3rcer: @m3rcer SeemsGood
[3:21:55] zachriel19: tentacle smash eh? I'm not really into that kinda porn.
[3:21:56] Archangel3003: 5 but you can upgrade it in the skill tree later
[3:22:14] Jukettaja: lol
[3:22:14] m3rcer: you will kinda have shit dmg until ur real 3rd character
[3:22:18] Slam39: Its good, and pretty long
[3:22:21] SirSamVimes: There is *many* skill trees
[3:22:23] AnnieJella: Its league but without the teammates Pog
[3:22:23] Scout_6613: sgreyBunny
[3:22:27] Norrak1: oh you've seen nothing hah
[3:22:28] WilliamKurokami: yup, and a tree with passives which you can change any time
[3:22:30] Maradum: The RPG mechanics in this game are REALLY well done yes
[3:22:33] Darkaros: @andyfjell Pog take my money
[3:22:36] Archangel3003: Yup, this is why people have been asking you to play it so many times as they knew you'd enjoy it LUL
[3:22:39] uui23: wait until the other characters show up LUL
[3:22:43] sarqon: you had me at tentacles
[3:22:46] bairdman: also a certain minigame beloved by gamers everywhere
[3:22:47] yrvengalied: Clap
[3:22:47] pakupalos: coxWiggle
[3:22:48] SirSamVimes: One of my favourite things is how great a job they did of translating mechanics from the actual game into a turn based format.
[3:22:52] Slam39: The save system sucks though
[3:22:57] jeffhunter12: the overcharge? yeah its awesome
[3:22:58] m3rcer: yep
[3:23:01] Norrak1: Even the side content has been a lot of fun, unique zones and fights, interesting stories
[3:23:07] sotasty_: Clap
[3:23:08] yrvengalied: overlimit in Battle Chasers
[3:23:21] n1rri: @Slam39 Wait what sucks with it? I've been playing a bit, and haven't had any issues with it.
[3:23:23] WDForty: what was it? wasn't looking at the screen when it happened
[3:23:23] jeffhunter12: i wonder if they have replayable dungeons in this one
[3:23:29] Mill0u: have they fixed illaoi ult bug yet?
[3:23:45] m3rcer: @Mill0u latest patch yes
[3:23:47] Reifuu: @jeffhunter12 replayable how? Resting at rest points resets the enemies at least
[3:23:49] Norrak1: yup
[3:23:50] SirSamVimes: @Norrak1 I was doing a sidequest and was expecting an encounter or two and ended up getting a huge optional dungeon
[3:23:51] Shazeio7: Liam O'brien?
[3:23:52] Jukettaja: I think that's Liam O'Brian
[3:23:59] Radcosh: sounds like it
[3:24:01] Mill0u: @m3rcer nice
[3:24:04] Scout_6613: she seems like she would be fun in tavens
[3:24:04] DrewGamer: @WDForty using basic attacks gives you "overcharge" (temporary mana that goes away at the end of battle). You can then use that (instead of mana) to cast other abilities.
[3:24:20] jeffhunter12: in battlechasers you got to choose  dugneon diff and can redo them with different procedural layouts
[3:24:22] SirSamVimes: yeah that's liam o'brien, they had him in the studio to voice Yasuo so I guess they got him to voice some other characters
[3:24:23] Veilshadow: What role does this character play in LoL?
[3:24:24] WDForty: oh cool
[3:24:27] CadaverLuke: isn't the ripper Pyke's title?
[3:24:28] ZooZooZelaNa: maybe pyke?
[3:24:29] Norrak1: @sirsamvimes Ya I had a handful of these so far, even Bounties have unique part of the zone and such
[3:24:30] bairdman: pyke
[3:24:32] SlipCrit: KEKW
[3:24:34] BakaOniiChan_: its pyke
[3:24:35] DJunioD: KEKW
[3:24:37] Reifuu: @Veilshadow top lane bruiser
[3:24:40] serralheir0: denied KEKW
[3:24:40] bairdman: they use the nicknames alot
[3:24:42] SirSamVimes: @Veilshadow Illaoi? She's a frontline top lane fighter
[3:24:49] Jukettaja: Let's make a prediction
[3:24:51] ryukenchi: what a chad
[3:24:52] Radcosh: spoilers
[3:24:52] bairdman: tidal trickster is Fizz <3
[3:24:56] Darkaros: John Gangplank Pog
[3:25:03] thrillhouse451: Snoo snoo
[3:25:11] jeffhunter12: ehehehe
[3:25:13] Veilshadow: ah okay thanks
[3:25:14] WilliamKurokami: I mean I know the answer but I won't tell
[3:25:24] AnnieJella: I have allready played this game so hell yeah lets do a prediction
[3:25:26] leftizzle: I’m going to guess it’s agent 47
[3:25:29] ryukenchi: death by snoo snoo?
[3:25:36] Shazeio7: It's definitely Darth Plagius
[3:25:36] n1rri: @jeffhunter12 Unless there's dungeons of that kind in a later area, there aren't any like repeatable ones akin to that in Bilgewater. It feels more forward momentum, less grindy thanks to it compared to Battlechasers.
[3:25:40] Flyspeck42: fizz Pog
[3:25:44] SirSamVimes: I would let Illaoi give me death by snoo snoo
[3:26:08] jeffhunter12: Oh for sure
[3:26:12] jeffhunter12: atleast one of them
[3:26:15] issalga: coxSeafood coxWiggle
[3:26:27] jeffhunter12: oh wait does this one have crafting?!
[3:26:43] uui23: it being less grindy than battlechaser is a good thing
[3:26:45] Jukettaja: +10 diary points
[3:26:56] Reifuu: @jeffhunter12 enchanting and some other thing I can't remember, but no direct crafting
[3:27:02] Shazeio7: Both

[3:27:12] ファ労苦: theres a lot of jarvans
[3:27:12] Ratspunk: hes the king of demacia
[3:27:15] Fuji_5: J3 is king
[3:27:15] ZooZooZelaNa: well jarvan the forth
[3:27:16] KAHVITEK: Jarvan IV in league
[3:27:18] Jukettaja: That's why they call him J4
[3:27:19] Reifuu: Name, but all the Demacian kings are Jarvan
[3:27:19] AnnieJella: He is jarvan the 4th what do you excpect LUL
[3:27:19] Fuji_5: J4 is a prince
[3:27:21] SirSamVimes: But he's Jarvan IV which implies three previous people who used him the name
[3:27:22] MrMacaroli: J3 is the king, J4 is the prince
[3:27:30] CadaverLuke: yeah, Jarvan the third was murdered by Sion
[3:27:31] epicshoo: ijp5HEAD
[3:27:31] ZeoBishop: learning lore Pog
[3:27:31] cleansock42: yeah and Sion killed the original Jarven
[3:27:37] SirSamVimes: @MrMacaroli isn't J4 the king as of Sylas' revoluation?
[3:27:38] Jukettaja: The more you know
[3:27:38] Ratspunk: isnt j3 dead at thjis point?
[3:27:39] ryukenchi: he finally gets the lore hehehe
[3:27:41] 4head_4weird: FeelsOkayMan
[3:27:45] AnnieJella: He literally has 4 in his name Jarvan IV LUL
[3:27:46] Shazeio7: And J5 is an old pop group from the past.
[3:27:48] Fuji_5: sion killed j2 and uses his crown as his lower jaw
[3:27:51] itsJprof: oh, thats why
[3:27:54] ファ労苦: i think j3 is dead yeah, i dont keep up though
[3:27:56] jeffhunter12: pretty art
[3:28:00] RlDennis: J4 is the king since Sylas murdered J3 I believe rooVV
[3:28:01] CadaverLuke: Sion's lower jaw is J3's old crown
[3:28:03] cleansock42: Fun fact Sion's Jaw is the Crown of the original Jarven
[3:28:05] WilliamKurokami: and that's just Bilgewater
[3:28:07] MrMacaroli: @SirSamVimes I think in the latest stuff, yeah - my lore's a little old
[3:28:08] ファ労苦: @Fuji_5, p sure he killed j1
[3:28:18] ZooZooZelaNa: @cleansock42 lol srsly?
[3:28:25] jeffhunter12: thats metal as fuck
[3:28:27] m3rcer: not j3 but j1 i think
[3:28:34] cleansock42: J1
[3:28:40] AnnieJella: We are gonna need more arcane to teach jp some lore
[3:28:46] cleansock42: Sion was an old Noxus warrior brought back to life
[3:28:52] DoctorJohn: can I enjoy this if I know nothing about League lore?
[3:28:55] m3rcer: mmm looks like u hit
[3:28:56] KAHVITEK: catJAM
[3:29:08] SirSamVimes: @DoctorJohn yes, it tells you everything you need to know
[3:29:11] cleansock42: @DoctorJohn o yeah this game will explain everything you need to know
[3:29:23] Shin_FielDGaR: Therer is a strange concentration off Riot games on this stream lately ;;)
[3:29:40] Flyspeck42: catJAM
[3:30:10] NejyCR: weird
[3:30:12] Onefootstout: LUL
[3:30:16] CadaverLuke: Riot Games is on FIRE right now of course its on stream lol
[3:30:17] epicshoo: Hmm
[3:30:18] Onefootstout: funny how that works
[3:30:22] KAHVITEK: Thats so weird coincidence.
[3:30:23] Dr4gonb0rn_: I been putting off buying this so far but its looks pretty decent like I thought it may be
[3:30:26] cleansock42: @cleansock42 yeah highly recommend looking up Noxus lore its pretty insane
[3:30:36] Shin_FielDGaR: any first impressions of the game? I thought its gonna be like discipples/heroes combat, was surprised its a JRPG style combat
[3:30:39] Infidel_Art: i'm digging the league content
[3:30:39] Reifuu: You can always reallocate points
[3:30:39] KchaosRei: And Jps wife works for Riot
[3:30:45] Archangel3003: I like that it shows you the turn order at the bottom and you can move around the lanes to get an ability or heal off early.
[3:31:04] Inqy833: It's by the same people who did the Battle Chasers RPG I think, you can certainly see the influence.
[3:31:04] Darkaros: So far (literally ~30 minutes in), JP likes this game and is pleasantly surprised at its goodness
[3:31:17] jeffhunter12: oehh i like this upgrade system
[3:31:17] m3rcer: @itmeJP u can take a point of a skill at any time
[3:31:17] itsJprof: this stuff is so cool, it's swappable too
[3:31:19] DrewGamer: @Shin_FielDGaR First impressions are its a very enjoyable turn-based game with a league of legends theme :)
[3:31:19] Myros00: Man.. I loved Battle Chasers so much. I might just get this NotLikeThis
[3:31:19] WilliamKurokami: btw you can change them whenever
[3:31:19] Shin_FielDGaR: @KchaosRei  ye I was trying to be funny in that direction, but failed :/
[3:31:31] yrvengalied: yes
[3:31:34] Exitarnium: I was avid about LoL when it first launched and spent years with my buddies talking about how it needs to have a show and other games, so stoked to live in the timeline that is true
[3:31:36] ControllerZen: That Arcane show was my first exposure to League of Legends. It was great!
[3:31:38] Archangel3003: @itmeJP You skipped that but it tells you that you can respec anytime for free. Like move the points
[3:31:38] DrewGamer: @WilliamKurokami being able to freely switch skills at any time is SOOOO good
[3:31:39] SirSamVimes: Free respecs at any time is always the correct choice imo.
[3:31:40] Nickonil: !next
[3:31:40] itmeBOT: Upcoming Games/Events From https://JPedia.net: FFXIV CoT FC Shadowbringers Send-Off Party @ 3PM-7PM ET - Sunday, November 28 | Community Day - Tuesday, November 30 | FFXIV Endwalker - Friday, December 3 | The Games Awards 2021 Co-Stream - Thursday, December 9
[3:31:42] thanh_n2004: but JP if you can change whenever, how can you feel the weight of your choices?
[3:31:42] yrvengalied: you can change build at anytime
[3:31:50] JoBee93: This game looks sick. I think its by the same devs that made Battlechasers, which was a great rpg
[3:31:53] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[3:31:58] WilliamKurokami: @DrewGamer yes, it's one of the best things
[3:31:59] NejyCR: when i hear praise for a game from a streamer i always check to see if theres a #ad
[3:32:05] ZeoBishop: so many good shows coming out
[3:32:25] Hawndoh: the only thing I know about League of Legends is the Mechs vs Minions board game I bought a few years ago
[3:32:35] Inqy833: For an RPG like this, being able to change your build easily is the best choice yeah. It means if you do reach a point where it gets hard, there's a lot of things you can do to change how you fight and try new things.
[3:32:35] ryukenchi: i still dislike league, but they definitely have my money if they make more series or games like these.
[3:32:39] cleansock42: Arcane season 2 is already in the works
[3:32:41] Darkaros: archipel-ago AYAYA
[3:32:41] ryukenchi: the lore is definitely interesting
[3:32:48] Darkaros: ^ agree
[3:32:52] WDForty: i'm loving how riot is making good games that expand on the universe of LoL, but don't require someone to play LoL and get raged at for not being pro
[3:32:56] KAHVITEK: for sure @ryukenchi
[3:33:00] AnorienNightwish: Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4 MOAR tentacles
[3:33:06] BoooFN: hi friends cirAYAYA
[3:33:11] Jukettaja: Some optimist
[3:33:13] Archangel3003: Oh yeah the Journal entries are their own thing as well that gives you rewards lol.
[3:33:36] Darkaros: @BoooFN ijpHI
[3:33:36] CadaverLuke: @Jukettaja i know right LUL hah
[3:33:45] Reifuu: You can't with the side bozos
[3:33:49] WilliamKurokami: you can't with those basic characters
[3:33:49] SirSamVimes: Can't yet, nameless mooks can't be party lead.
[3:33:53] Sinnethx: not yet ..they are nonames
[3:33:53] Reifuu: You need to have the real characters for that
[3:33:57] ZeoBishop: monkaS
[3:33:58] Inqy833: Lore/plot wise my only complaint is that they didn't make Twisted Fate and Graves PCs. But really "they didn't put my favourite characters in" is a fairly minor, inevitable complaint when Riot have like hundres of character by now.
[3:34:07] WDForty: need more coxWiggle
[3:34:16] DrewGamer: @WDForty to be fair, I don't think League really has any lore in the actual game itself anyway 😅
[3:34:22] Reifuu: I love this combat song
[3:34:27] Reifuu: Reminds me so much of black sails
[3:34:38] DejaDrew: @WDForty It has tons man
[3:34:48] AnorienNightwish: well at least the AI is not focusing on the low health one
[3:34:50] SirSamVimes: @Inqy833 but it has illaoi therefore it's perfect, best character
[3:34:56] KAHVITEK: Bilgewater music is really nice.
[3:35:05] Inqy833: @DrewGamer Yeah, seems like setting lore is mostly developed AROUND the main games, rather than in the games themselves. These recent games are the exception/change of direction.
[3:35:17] DoctorJohn: ijpNEVILLE my cat this morning
[3:35:29] SirSamVimes: they made the League of Legends itself non-canon while they develop lore around it
[3:35:37] Inqy833: Kraken-lady is awesome, yes.
[3:35:42] Ratspunk: LEARN!
[3:35:46] n1rri: I'd say the biggest stepping point of lore in a League game, has been Legends of Runeterra. The card game, mostly through all the art & voice lines.
[3:36:00] camerongio1: yeah its actually so funny how the actual game itself is non cannon but everything surrounding it is
[3:36:07] Archangel3003: I mean you said you want to learn top lane JP. And Illaoi is a top laner.
[3:36:07] Flyspeck42: white essence monkaEyes
[3:36:18] Jukettaja: I like that they included speeding up the animations
[3:36:20] SirSamVimes: I really like how Illaoi is characterised as being devout and faithful, but also seeing the value in other cultures. She reveres life and motion and sees that in Bilgewater, even if they do not believe in her Buhru god.
[3:36:22] Late2thegam3: Soo many systems hype
[3:36:42] WDForty: yea, when Riot was just LoL, i wasn't interested cause i'm not a fan of DOTA style games, plus the playerbase doesn't feel very noob friendly, but with all this new stuff they've been releasing, it's very approachable to me and has got me genuinely interested in their stuff
[3:36:50] Snowfunk: catJAM cohhJam ratJAM
[3:37:20] WDForty: i'm a big fan of their current apprach to things, at least for now, we will see where it leads
[3:37:24] Jukettaja: The fighting game might be the one everyone's looking forward to next
[3:37:29] malkious: malkious subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[3:37:29] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing malkious! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:37:37] DrewGamer: @Snowfunk cohhJam coxJam
[3:38:00] WilliamKurokami: you can crit, though you'd want a crit chance buff
[3:38:03] Cixah: Pog
[3:38:04] yrvengalied: Pog
[3:38:06] Jukettaja: I approve
[3:38:06] ZeoBishop: Pog
[3:38:07] 4head_4weird: Pog
[3:38:10] yrvengalied: it deserves it
[3:38:12] camerongio1: Pog
[3:38:12] Inqy833: Sounds fun
[3:38:13] Infidel_Art: Pog
[3:38:14] GeekInUndies: Clap
[3:38:15] SzybkiLopez86: 20h ?
[3:38:16] Akspert: pOG
[3:38:16] Scout_6613: SeemsGood
[3:38:17] CadaverLuke: i'll be watching if so
[3:38:19] cleansock42: hell yeah
[3:38:22] Dr4gonb0rn_: Pog
[3:38:23] JeXus1985: did he just say full playthrough of SMT5 POG
[3:38:25] camerongio1: It only gets better JP
[3:38:38] Late2thegam3: why do I find pinging the room so satisfying?
[3:38:40] Flyspeck42: @JeXus1985 hypeE
[3:38:47] yrvengalied: same with Battle chasers if you have a time to enjoy it off stream @itmeJP it will not have some of this games mechanics but its really good game
[3:39:40] ファ労苦: the start imo is the most boring part of this game so should be good
[3:39:50] Flyspeck42: GOT EM
[3:39:55] epicshoo: ratJAM
[3:39:56] pakupalos: coxWiggle
[3:40:13] n1rri: Overcharge is also nice, because if you do run out of base mana. The character isn't just completely useless, you can just build up the overcharge.
[3:40:20] Late2thegam3: is the attack animation hinting at rte mechanic?
[3:40:32] RhapsodyBD: Hello!!
[3:40:54] Snowfunk: catJAM cohhJam ratJAM
[3:40:58] WilliamKurokami: Braum and Pyke

[3:42:11] WilliamKurokami: @Darkaros ijpLOOT
[3:42:27] ranin: is this an early access kind of deal or the complete game?
[3:42:28] Jukettaja: This is a combat speed I can get behind
[3:42:35] DrewGamer: @ranin its 100% complete
[3:42:37] Late2thegam3: ijpNOPERS
[3:42:46] Nurama: @itmeJP i totally forgot hawkeye starts in 4 days, whats the hype-o-meter for that right now?
[3:42:50] MakenshiX: a
[3:42:55] MakenshiX: animations look super smooth
[3:43:12] yrvengalied: nope
[3:43:16] k0jak: MmmHmm
[3:43:23] Darkaros: whoguy
[3:43:28] DrewGamer: very satisfying abilities for sure NODDERS
[3:43:35] k0jak: cowboy bebop looks not good
[3:43:36] ZeoBishop: so many good shows coming out
[3:43:36] Dametri: arcane is so good
[3:43:37] MrDigitalCypher: Both are great
[3:43:42] afreak10: cowboy bebop is kinda bad
[3:43:44] Kn0w1edge: sounds like an 8 outta 10 to me
[3:43:44] SirSamVimes: Arcane is phenomenal, WoT is very good.
[3:43:46] aznhai: arcane, hoooooo boooy
[3:43:47] ranin: cowboy is missing the mark, WoT is good
[3:43:48] vegetius: wheel of time kinda bad
[3:43:52] Nurama: cowboy bebop... feels off slightly
[3:43:55] n1rri: Cowboy Bebop is like the most 'ok' thing ever.
[3:43:56] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Just watch the last 3 Arcane. I was screaming at the end.
[3:43:57] croppeast: Arcane was amazing! Cowboy was kinda meh
[3:43:58] ZeoBishop: witcher season 2 is soon as well
[3:43:59] Dementepingu: Wheel of time episode 1 is rough, ep 2 and 3 better
[3:44:00] DoctorJohn: it's so rough. the rest of it seems good so far
[3:44:04] sarqon: i liked wheel of time
[3:44:05] Archangel3003: We are being spoiled this month
[3:44:08] k0jak: oh then i won't enjoy it then
[3:44:09] AinzN: I liked it
[3:44:10] 1sttimelurker: cowboy bepop music is so good
[3:44:11] Darkaros: filthy weebs
[3:44:11] hollysephiroth: @MrDigitalCypher wait is cowboybebop good ?
[3:44:12] k0jak: AYAYA
[3:44:12] Snowfunk: Wheel of Time seems cheesy, only watched the first episode, b ut it was rough.
[3:44:18] DoctorJohn: my wife is religiously into Cowboy Bebop and she's gonna give it a chance
[3:44:19] Klinex: Imagine being a nerd PepeLaugh
[3:44:22] crazydude991: having not seen Cowboy Bebop before i'm liking it, it's really good
[3:44:25] crazydude991: Acting is great
[3:44:27] Kyuukotsu: @MondoGibbs Don't do that to me man, I gotta wait three more days to watch it. LUL
[3:44:28] Vortyrion: I like the Cowboy Bebop
[3:44:30] Dementepingu: @Snowfunk ep 2 was my favorite, way better than first
[3:44:31] ranin: yeah first episode of WoT is rough gets better after
[3:44:31] Nurama: well im anime adjacent but it is one of my top 3 animes so. eh xD
[3:44:35] Archangel3003: !arcane
[3:44:35] itmeBOT: JP has watched up to Arcane Act II (NOT Act III yet) and has enjoyed it a lot! He thinks it's the best video game adaptation into a TV show etc so far, over stuff like Castelvania/Dota/Witcher, and would recommend it to people who haven't experienced League of Legends at all.
[3:44:37] Mrshilka: @DoctorJohn I just finished the live action series myself
[3:44:38] DoctorJohn: like I can't overstate how into Bebop my wife is. I have a spike spiegel suit she made me
[3:44:42] Liffi: I can see that cowboy bebob can be good enough for some. I just think it kind of badly acted.
[3:44:43] MrDigitalCypher: @hollysephiroth yeah. I mean it is not a 1 for 1 to the anime but it is enjoyable
[3:44:48] WilliamKurokami: I mean Cowboy Bebop has 51% on Rotten Tomatoes both critics and viewers ijpSHRUG then again I don't like it in general
[3:45:02] Liffi: Wheel of time was ok general fantasy.
[3:45:11] hollysephiroth: @MrDigitalCypher did you like the anime ?
[3:45:12] DoctorJohn: hahahaha yeah but that's what I'm saying, she says it looks okay and she's gonna give it a chance
[3:45:15] Kalels729: I'm an anime need, and I still enjoyed the cowboy bebop live action. not sure why people are so negative.
[3:45:16] Willemvh: does someone know what chair he is sitting on ? Doiing new office chair scouting ^^
[3:45:18] DoctorJohn: some of the trailers were incredible
[3:45:20] Snowfunk: @Dementepingu Good to hear, definitely going to watch the first 3 before deciding if I want to keep watching.
[3:45:21] Darkaros: !chair
[3:45:21] itmeBOT: It's a Steelcase Gesture ijpCHAIR
[3:45:24] Whiskeydog23: @itmeJP have you chosen your job yet for Endwalker MSQ?
[3:45:32] MrDigitalCypher: @hollysephiroth yes, but i also never watched it 95 times like some fans
[3:45:35] Willemvh: nice
[3:45:43] Darkaros: (JP really likes this chair btw, he's had two replacements / repairs on it for new versions; he's had a Steelcase Leap before)
[3:45:47] ZeoBishop: D:
[3:45:51] hollysephiroth: @MrDigitalCypher glad I watched it only 94 times
[3:45:53] Mrshilka: @DoctorJohn do you own a Jericho 941 R to go witht he suit?

[3:46:49] Ratspunk: correct me if im wrong but isnt illaoi's god the same one who brought pyke back?
[3:46:57] ranin: @VictorianGenetix never played the game so i have no clue
[3:47:01] hollysephiroth: @MrDigitalCypher gonna give it a try , thanks
[3:47:05] Nurama: @Sethur his background story is just updated nautilus. xD

[4:18:55] Dassiz: wait why is this music so good
[4:18:55] NaturallyMorbid: @Flyspeck42 Ya i assumed, Blizzard hasnt really original with their character design of late
[4:19:01] Madracah: TAUNT ?
[4:19:52] AnnieJella: Riot games has made more music than games @Dassiz LUL
[4:19:54] Trample11: Taunt into defend is really good on braum
[4:20:00] Flyspeck42: @NaturallyMorbid they both are kind of a play on the old "strongman" archetype, they were always jacked bald dudes with mustaches
[4:20:14] Archangel3003: Link for Collectors Edition: https://merch.riotgames.com/en-us/product/ruined-king-collector-s-edition/
[4:20:16] AnnieJella: Riot games owns a metal band and orchestra and multiple kpop bands
[4:20:16] levmel: Whelp?!
[4:20:57] NaturallyMorbid: @Flyspeck42 Its a bit more than that, its the facial features and over all structure, hell even the voice actor sounds similar
[4:21:11] La_Fourmi: and upgrade tier
[4:21:23] Ippsi: 100% if you have the mats and you can put in more mats to over enchant them
[4:21:23] aznhai: they give u a ton of mats and they become useless once I progress, so don't be conservative
[4:21:28] blueeid: and fishing??
[4:21:51] Boonia: Jp u might have skins in equipment
[4:22:00] WilliamKurokami: yes, there even is fishing
[4:23:37] SzybkiLopez86: Why dint heal?
[4:23:40] Whiskeydog23: was MF the tutorial character and Illoai is main character?
[4:23:50] WilliamKurokami: what confuses me is the fact that those tentacles are the same as some SI cards from LoR. are her powers from the isles?
[4:24:18] Darkaros: People have said the hardest difficulty is quite hard. There's 4 difficulties and you can change at any time
[4:24:21] Bearsquatch: @WilliamKurokami her power comes from, her goddess of the sea
[4:24:38] samael_40k: check enemy info
[4:24:49] Archangel3003: @pharpharr Challenging or you can set the difficulty to make it easier to just enjoy story.
[4:25:10] WilliamKurokami: @Bearsquatch maybe the isles originally had a connection to the Buhru?
[4:25:24] WilliamKurokami: could just be similar design
[4:25:28] WilliamKurokami: ijpSHRUG
[4:25:35] La_Fourmi: ohoh
[4:25:44] WilliamKurokami: JP, read the text at the top
[4:26:12] uui23: LUL he finally read
[4:26:14] WilliamKurokami: I did the same mistake cohhLUL
[4:26:22] Archangel3003: Remember the lanes. you can switch to the speed lane to get a heal off, or defence, before he attacks
[4:27:23] chalando: cohhJam
[4:28:17] pakupalos: splt
[4:28:19] xmlgprorpx: split
[4:28:27] WilliamKurokami: but everyone gets some
[4:28:37] Sinnethx: heal pots?
[4:28:45] aznhai: there's no option to bench. everyone gets XP regardless
[4:29:54] AinzN: Yeah
[4:29:55] Bearsquatch: ABL: Always Be Lootin'

[4:31:11] La_Fourmi: yep
[4:31:12] OneOfManyMikes: is it a rogue lite / like or are there stories / linear progression for each hero / a single story line/ playthrough?
[4:31:14] Mallatom: D:
[4:31:15] DeepPurpleSea: she killed him??
[4:31:17] Bearsquatch: Yurp

[4:31:24] Fuji_5: yes, GP is evil cuz she left him
[4:31:25] DeepPurpleSea: I missed that ark
[4:31:44] Argo257: @OneOfManyMikes it is an rpg with amain story and side stuff
[4:31:49] Archangel3003: Yo how come her beloved goddess didn't test Gankplank huh?!?
[4:31:50] britishboomer: gangplank likes to get pegged - confirmed.
[4:32:20] OneOfManyMikes: @Argo257 Thanks, so like a singular playthrough with side content it sounds like :) appreciate the info
[4:32:21] chalando: If I liked battlechasers I assume I’ll enjoy this? ijpONO
[4:32:26] ファ労苦: wh OMEGALUL
[4:32:31] Bearsquatch: @itmeJP coolest champion rework was GP. They killed him in the lore, disabled him for a few days, and revealed his rework a few days later.
[4:32:33] La_Fourmi: D:
[4:32:34] uui23: LUL
[4:32:34] Onefootstout: LUL

[4:33:08] McBritches: did you just start this game?
[4:33:15] Argo257: @OneOfManyMikes i am 18 hours in and still have alot to do so i would say this game is around 25 till 30 hours at least
[4:33:20] Darkaros: Yes, we're about an hour and a half into the game McBritches
[4:33:22] McBritches: oh nice
[4:33:36] WantedOne: people been spaming that in the riot stream chat @jp
[4:33:50] hollysephiroth: powder > miss f
[4:33:54] bairdman: I am Braum. I am also here.
[4:33:56] Onefootstout: everyone wants to bang Braum
[4:33:56] DeepPurpleSea: do they have the same voice actors as in lol?
[4:33:59] LegendsOfBobby: braum is handsome
[4:34:01] OneOfManyMikes: @Argo257 Do you know if the story is canon with the other stories their telling, like with arcane for example, I know this is in Bilgewater, as opposed to Piltover/Zaun
[4:34:03] BelisColdwine: This games is basically just reskinned Battle Chasers, right? It's not a coincidence they look so similar?
[4:34:08] NyxVT: nyxvt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 27 month streak! ijpCHEER ijpCHEER ijpCHEER

[4:34:21] WantedOne: @BelisColdwine made by the same devs
[4:34:22] AnnieJella: Iron fist PepeLaugh
[4:34:33] Onefootstout: @BelisColdwine the loop is different, the overworld is not like battle chasers but very similar
[4:34:41] bairdman: a sort of prequel to the sentinel event that happened earlier in the year
[4:34:45] BelisColdwine: Gotcha. ty
[4:34:45] aetralos: @applebananacake Sarah Connor, mother of teminator-savior
[4:34:58] Argo257: @OneOfManyMikes to be honest i have no idea if it is canon or not^^ but i can tell you that it is told pretty good :P
[4:34:58] WantedOne: @applebananacake miss fortune
[4:35:08] Woowookins: So... Is this a visual novel?
[4:35:10] AnnieJella: Look who has an iron fist now
[4:35:12] Bearsquatch: GP is a boss after his "death"
[4:35:16] Fuji_5: @itmeJP you might appreciate the parallels between the Battle Chasers characters and League champions. Garrison = Garen. Gully = Poppy. Red Monika = Ms Fortune. Calibretto = Blitzcrank
[4:35:19] Onefootstout: JP becoming a gangplank apologist
[4:35:20] OneOfManyMikes: @Argo257 Thanks I appreciate the info, definitely going to have to check this out :)

[4:39:02] aetralos: @itmeJP this sword guy looks cool! is he a loved by community LoL champion? Kappa LUL
[4:39:07] Bearsquatch: @SirSamVimes Graves and TF are mercenaries, when Riot redid the Bilgewater lore, they were key players
[4:39:15] morbidchaff8: I mean they showed who the robed woman is in the trailer LUL dont want to say it tho if its spoilers

[4:41:52] CadaverLuke: Yasuo's not used to being carried
[4:41:53] Korul_Sig: @andyfjell she couldn't, he windwalled :P
[4:41:59] prfella: oh thats Illidan Stormrages VA
[4:42:02] SirSamVimes: @WantedOne liam o'brien is kinda typecast as the edgy broody voice in a lot of games, but that's kind of a waste because the actor is really good at charm

[4:44:37] Pseudocrat: She's a predator
[4:44:39] HeliosAres: emotional vamps
[4:44:39] Exitarnium: Btw JP check if you have access to enchanting in the menus, the game doesnt really tell you about it

[4:45:21] SirSamVimes: unless they're tiny, then they're a yordle
[4:45:28] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Ahri lives as a hermit most of the time as she is deadly afraid of hurting people
