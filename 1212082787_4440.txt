[1:14:04] Baludor: Yea, I always see half my team afk behind a rock staring at their done ipads LUL
[1:14:11] ワフルデラ: it's a fun game, but it misses a lot of features of old battlefields to make it a "real" battlefield
[1:14:13] WilliamKurokami: let's just say I'd play it on game pass but I wouldn't buy it
[1:14:15] Altair900: This game is great fun. The UI bugs and crashes are one of the few things holding it back, and those can be fixed
[1:14:15] Talon244092: evreybody sayin its fun but buggy that true?
[1:14:17] hitechffs: its very diifferent from other BFs in its design
[1:14:19] goatking_99: Rough is kinda an understatement
[1:14:22] muffinface__: is that a 3x pp
[1:14:30] hitechffs: alot of bugs and features missing

[1:14:38] Marc326: new world Kappa
[1:14:43] WilliamKurokami: Hades, Ruined King
[1:14:47] onelazygamer: @itmeJP Halo
[1:14:53] os_nexus: is this game worth the full price?
[1:14:53] VexedCheese: AinzN but I want a fully voice acted, deep meaningful, thoughtful story with empathy, suspense and an unexpected twist
[1:14:54] WilliamKurokami: there are a few
[1:14:55] Whiskeydog23: cyberpunk didnt have any!!
[1:14:55] hitechffs: HALO feels so polished compared to this
[1:14:58] ワフルデラ: Skyrim Kappa
[1:14:59] HappyCow7404: Why is this game not on the Game Pass?
[1:15:02] Talon244092: halo but that gets boring real quick
[1:15:05] VexedCheese: AinzN ijpSMUG
[1:15:16] hitechffs: look at the steam reviews before buying I'd say
[1:15:23] NullSignal: @HappyCow7404 ea play comes with gamepass and you can play for 10 hours with that
[1:15:24] AinzN: VexedCheese that comes later in the game. This is still the tutorial ijpSIP
[1:15:27] NoorElBahrain: My controller bugged in Ruined King PepeHands WilliamKurokami I found a work around though ijpH
[1:15:28] onelazygamer: @WilliamKurokami Play Ruined King on ultrwide and there are plenty of bugs unfortunately
[1:15:30] woschdvendetta: i wanted this to be fun, but played CoD vanguard with a work buddy earlier, gotta say vanguard is much more fun than this, which i never thought i'd say
[1:15:34] Aoewin: halo is not an open map wit 64 vs 64 with vehicule and all.. compare apple with apple at least
[1:15:39] VexedCheese: AinzN ijpLAUGH
[1:15:43] iskavan1: @HappyCow7404 JP would like to know the answer to that question too. He even lost a bet for because of it.
[1:15:50] Jukettaja: Your driver is insane
[1:16:00] TETLegion: you have a dust allergy? or for one of the pets?
[1:16:03] HappyCow7404: @NullSignal Dang only 10 hours.
[1:16:08] WilliamKurokami: @onelazygamer that just m,eans it doesn't fully support ultrawide which is very common still
[1:16:09] bakavic: every bf game comes out to negative reviews, then when the next bf game comes out, people will pine for the old one that they previous reviewed negatively

[1:16:33] Talon244092: sadly cod vanguard is the worst fps ever released it makes this look godly
[1:16:43] goatking_99: Ngl the guns in this sound terrible, like shooting airsoft
[1:16:44] NullSignal: @HappyCow7404 yeah. you get it unlimited for the month with ea play pro if you wanna pay for that instead of the whole game, though
[1:16:45] ワフルデラ: @Aoewin that's not how it works, DICE chose to do that, if they couldn't do it they should've not gone for it
[1:16:46] Talon244092: bugs  and all

[1:33:30] titanodin: till xp gain
[1:33:30] jaxmaru: its pretty much instant
[1:33:31] ワフルデラ: 1-2 seconds? pretty short
[1:33:37] Azaes: probably until the text says "enemy spotted" and an icon appears
[1:33:38] Zucate: Darkaros to be fair, that failure lies with the writers/directors, not with superman
[1:33:44] titanodin: you can
[1:34:02] titanodin: its a range thing
[1:34:07] ワフルデラ: now imagine if it was breakthrough and 64 enemies were rushing one flag you're looking at with your drone
[1:34:15] AinzN: ijpNODDERS
[1:34:27] WilliamKurokami: okay, I could see myself doing that all the time KEKHeim
[1:34:33] Darkaros: I wonder if real drone operators also just have a sandwich in their hand while using em
[1:34:35] Baludor: Feels like we're watching CCTV footage or a dashcam
[1:34:37] BakaOniiChan_: the drone gives much more points on the other mode, because all enemies are clumped up
[1:34:44] crapnel_x: @Darkaros for sure
[1:34:44] Azaes: is breakthrough the same as rush was?
[1:34:49] SlipCrit: yes
[1:34:52] AinzN: Azaes yeah
[1:34:57] jaxmaru: also the pulsing effect middle low is your personal enemy scan. so with that you can see if there is a enemy near you
[1:34:58] ワフルデラ: in terms of chaos, mostly
[1:35:06] BakaOniiChan_: or if you're close to an enemy point, instead of your own point
[1:35:09] ワフルデラ: unless you have a team that kinda breaks off into different flags
[1:35:14] Azaes: any reason why they renamed the mode?
[1:35:16] titanodin: drones spotting is fun, its more fun too harrass them so they shoot at you XD
[1:35:18] ranin: has bf had an update yet fixing stuff?
[1:35:32] nathanJ23: holy shit LUL
[1:35:34] Azaes: 10 billion enemies

[1:36:02] Darkaros: LUL
[1:36:05] NullSignal: robbed
[1:36:06] novafreez3: KEKW
[1:36:16] crapnel_x: that would have been hilarious
[1:36:21] ranin: if only r6siege drone was this good
[1:36:25] titanodin: connection is your range
[1:36:33] sarah_gif: that sammich
[1:36:42] titanodin: get close to tank and rick click
[1:36:46] ranin: what does emp locking do and how long does it last?
[1:36:46] titanodin: right
[1:36:58] Azaes: ranin to be fair. those drones have less enemies to spot
[1:37:08] Baludor: EMP disables their weapons @ranin
[1:37:17] dragonninja43: if i buy the base game today, can i play without an ea play account
[1:37:18] ranin: @Azaes sure, just would be cool if a character had one likle this
[1:37:21] jaxmaru: to that one asking Day 1 patch has been applied and day 10 and 25 are on the way
[1:37:24] Killian_Hart: if you were to get two drones next to eachother could you stick a person on top and fly them around
[1:37:31] AinzN: ijpKEK
[1:37:35] titanodin: NODDERS
[1:37:37] Lanko10: this is the 8th worst game of all time according to Steam reviews
[1:37:45] SlipCrit: its fully out now yeh
[1:37:46] NullSignal: you don't need ea play
[1:37:46] The_Anonymous_Gift: the heli scared me
[1:38:01] Altair900: I have mine on steam + origin, yeah
[1:38:03] bakavic: even on steam it will require origin
[1:38:04] SlipCrit: you prob need an origin accoutn still
[1:38:05] WilliamKurokami: yeah, that's gonna happen a lot I'd assume KEKHeim
[1:38:06] WellBrained: Buy it on steam, but it runs origin in the background for me
[1:38:10] ワフルデラ: steam still downloads the origin client
[1:38:12] NullSignal: you need an ea account but you don't need to pay extra for ea play
[1:38:15] PurplePirate_: is it true that you can stick C5 to the drone? Will the detonation work from far away?
[1:38:16] Azaes: does the drone do any ramming damage against helicopters?
[1:38:16] ワフルデラ: and launches it from there
[1:38:26] NinjaPandaEU: @PurplePirate_ Yes and yes.
[1:38:32] Balkep: only newly spotted enemies count
[1:38:34] dragonninja43: i have origin acc but i dont wana get ea acc
[1:38:36] bakavic: @PurplePirate_ yea you can stick c5 or medkits to the drone
[1:38:37] PurplePirate_: @NinjaPandaEU thanks!
[1:38:44] hamburglarhunter: Wonder if it counts the same people you spot again
[1:38:47] NullSignal: @dragonninja43 an origin account is an ea account
[1:38:48] Azaes: dragonninja43 i think thats the same
[1:38:51] bakavic: stick a medkit on drone and ferry it around for portable healing
[1:38:53] Darkaros: @Lanko10 ijpNOPERS Not high enough, we need more negative reviews. Luckily Battlefield's still the best selling game on Steam right now
[1:39:04] dragonninja43: i mean eplay
[1:39:08] ranin: review bombing is kinda shitty :/
[1:39:10] dragonninja43: ea play
[1:39:17] ワフルデラ: KEKw
[1:39:26] WilliamKurokami: lol that's like 20 seconds cooldown for it
[1:39:40] NullSignal: @dragonninja43 right, you don't need an ea play subscription to play if you buy it
[1:39:48] bakavic: everyone is using the pp29 lol, hope they fix the bullet issue soon
[1:39:55] Balkep: killing a drone gives 1k xp per match once
[1:40:05] ranin: is the drone invisible or why is nobody shooting at it?
[1:40:06] dragonninja43: ok ty for the help
[1:40:06] PurplePirate_: @bakavic sticking medkits to it sounds fun LUL
[1:40:10] Killian_Hart: its seems situational
[1:40:11] Xstriuss: What cpu and gpu are you using jp? It runs so well
[1:40:12] NullSignal: this is just a bad section of the map for it
[1:40:14] Juicefullorange: @Darkaros danBlank #1 is Farming Simulator 22
[1:40:16] Darkaros: !specs
[1:40:17] itmeBOT: JP's specs/gear can be found at https://itme.jp/specs
[1:40:17] Balkep: @ranin they are tiny
[1:40:29] ワフルデラ: the best map is the one with the uncappable point on the roof, you can use the drone to scan literally every defender since they spawn up there
[1:40:30] Darkaros: Xstriuss JP has high specs BUT there was just a driver update and he says it runs a lot better now
[1:40:31] PsychMike: He splat
[1:40:41] NoorElBahrain: !specs

[1:44:24] jaxmaru: FPV racing when erynKEK
[1:44:25] NinjaPandaEU: I think it also really helps. Intel is so important in BF.
[1:44:45] sneakypooo: How long do people stay tagged once you spot them?
[1:45:07] jaxmaru: 5 to 10 seconds I say
[1:45:20] Azaes: "how did they know?"
[1:45:45] PurplePirate_: i kinda feel bad for him LUL
[1:45:53] Whytepap3r: Surprised JP hasn't gotten shot yet. Really low, but paying off
[1:46:01] EndyBT: I saw someone mentioning it before, but is the PP-29 supergood due to a bug?
[1:46:22] RaiderWins: Spotting looks like fun
[1:46:26] gigamesh00: the weapon got no bloom
[1:46:31] bakavic: @EndyBT its good because it doesnt have insane bullet bloom like the other weapons
[1:46:34] Azaes: i dont think people are experienced enough yet to really notice the drone
[1:46:45] bakavic: the pp29 and dm7 is like laser focused
[1:46:46] jaxmaru: from what I've seen from tweets. its the other weapons bloom are bugged and pp29's works as intended.
[1:46:47] Whiskeydog23: @itmeJP do you have a favorite operator?
[1:46:47] keosak: From what I heard it's because all the other weapons are affected by a bug.
[1:46:55] EndyBT: @itmejp hell yeah is good... it feels absolutely monstrous :D
[1:47:07] Nickonil: i might give this game a second try now that i know about the spotting, since the game became borring to me since i never got any xp
[1:47:16] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[1:47:17] Balkep: spot nades and ammo crate is a good combo as well
[1:47:20] EndyBT: @bakavic oh, I didn't know! Thanks!
[1:47:28] Whytepap3r: No idea you could do that. Awesome
[1:47:31] bakavic: np
[1:47:37] AinzN: I've heard the Vector is great in this game as well
[1:47:40] ワフルデラ: I'm not sure but I think you can just put it somewhere and let it live and still get spot xp @itmeJP
[1:47:56] EndyBT: @bakavic the dm7 too? but I find the svk light-years better than the dm7... maybe I'm just bad :D
[1:47:56] Sunhammer756: is there upgrades to the drone?
[1:48:15] Achilles536825: Watching this spotting is by far the most entertained I've been watching BF2042.
[1:48:18] bakavic: yea I usually park my drone somewhere so it continues to spot and I just go do other stuff
[1:48:24] WilliamKurokami: it only disables the guns
[1:48:30] bakavic: @EndyBT svk is good also
[1:48:43] WilliamKurokami: JP is the annoying fly now cohhLUL
[1:49:04] Mrshilka: JP delivering a pizza via drone

[1:49:18] titanodin: zap his
[1:49:21] PurplePirate_: @Nickonil you could also play someone like the medic or Angel and get XP by reviving, healing and resupplying. You get get some nice XP in Breakthrough doing that.
[1:49:23] Balkep: LUL
[1:49:27] WilliamKurokami: imagine capturing with the drone KEKHeim

[1:49:47] diogo912: just the annoying enemy
[1:49:49] diogo912: love it
[1:49:50] crapnel_x: so does doing this reveal them on the map to others?
[1:50:02] Balkep: yes, that's the point
[1:50:03] Darkaros: monkaSTEER
[1:50:08] diogo912: you're essentially providing wallhack for the whole team
[1:50:09] Whytepap3r: I love spotting someone and then watching teammates hone in like raptors. Satisfying co-opp
[1:50:12] Nogardknight: this is the big XP farm
[1:50:14] titanodin: its SO fun
[1:50:16] PsychMike: Is there a reason nobody is shooting at the drone? Seems like an easy target, haha

[1:50:31] RaiderWins: It seems very satisfying and rewarding
[1:50:32] Gobboman: Knowledge is power
[1:50:34] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Practis for JPNN!
[1:50:35] ワフルデラ: @PsychMike no one can see it easily, it's way smaller than last BF's drone
[1:50:37] bakavic: @PsychMike for some reason, people in bf games never look up
[1:50:38] Balkep: can you destroy mines with emp?
[1:50:41] warmaku: you get no masteries
[1:50:42] feelle: new microsoft flight sim
[1:50:51] Nogardknight: they're also being shot at by 20 different things, so they're not really paying attention to a drone
[1:50:51] Darkaros: lmfao spotting the dude who gets point-blanked by a tank
[1:51:00] SaltyAsChuck: @itmeJP throw C5 on your drone and blow it up on a group

[2:07:48] VeloRama: wait, recon drone has EMP? cohhPog
[2:07:52] Fluxclad: the EMP is pretty invaluable
[2:07:55] Yoh1612: Are the drones that hard to spot?
[2:07:57] PSfanatic: Bumping stuff doesn't kill your drone?! DansGame
[2:08:02] AinzN: Might be becuase it's more constant than throwing two nades and then waiting to get more
[2:08:06] Nickonil: what happens if you emp a person?
[2:08:10] Miros__: @Yoh1612 gamers don't look up
[2:08:13] AinzN: Nickonil you can't
[2:08:17] Nickonil: ahh
[2:08:21] Fluxclad: you have to lockon so vehicle only
[2:08:22] VeloRama: as long as people aren't aware of your drone. it dies in 1-2 hits
[2:08:26] bakavic: the nades are throw and forget
[2:08:28] AinzN: The EMP is only vehicle lock on I think
[2:08:46] Nogardknight: good luck spotting the tiny drone, let alone hitting it with all the other stuff popping off
[2:08:48] Fluxclad: EMP is pretty frequent though you can make a tankers life miserable
[2:09:00] AinzN: The nades might get you more kill points as you can throw into a big fight
[2:09:04] JustLikeAMetaphor: All the drones on the minimap
[2:09:07] Fluxclad: more OP though is just tossing C5 on the drone and using it as a personal pocket cruise missile

[2:09:28] Miros__: This feels like the war correspondent segment of JPNN @itmeJP
[2:09:30] boomboomtap: nobody is even trying to take down this drone. Am I missing something? oO
[2:09:31] VeloRama: @Fluxclad i feel like it's better than hacking, hacking takes way too long
[2:09:32] cuetreepie: How has noone noticed

[2:12:19] VeloRama: @Sir_RobsterRoll even more so on this map with many snipers on the cranes LUL
[2:12:24] Baludor: Being in vehicles probably gets you the most
[2:12:26] Fluxclad: I cant believe it just auto recharges lol
[2:12:45] JamesOwenThe2nd: maybe ur not spotting where ur allies are fighting?
[2:12:51] joenotfromsingapore: Need to spot where the friendlies are for the 50xp

[3:04:04] antogain: how similar does this game seem to battlechasers so far?
[3:04:35] Uttrik: lol, these steam reviews, anything league related that does make you play actual league is 10/10
[3:05:23] Kalishir: Some of the steam reviews are amazing, I think my favourite was one where it was like "This is nothing like a league, Yasuo doesnt die in every fight"
[3:05:33] jellojacko: !next

[3:05:36] Uttrik: err yeah, doesnt*
[3:05:54] Exalted2000: I understand this isn't a new concept but this immediately gaveme battle chasers vibes
[3:06:10] prfella: @exalted2000 same devs
[3:06:13] Kirino20: its the same devs
[3:06:41] Exalted2000: @prfella Ok, that makes so much sense and now my wallet is crying in fear
[3:06:57] jellojacko: Doing another movie night anytime soon JP?
[3:07:15] AinzN: !wwt jellojacko
[3:07:15] itmeBOT: @jellojacko We Watch Things is a Watch Party show with hosts JP and @JERICHO. Episodes are every Monday at 6PM EST. Next show or movie we'll watch is the Ghost Stories English dub!
[3:07:16] Dunadin: I hope they will make a single player arpg, turn based seems really boring
[3:07:26] InvaderMig: This is single player right?
[3:07:26] Arkblade: its made by the Battle Chasers crew, they did a great job with that game
[3:07:37] eLMaQ: @InvaderMig yep
[3:07:49] kalculate: It's not boring at all if you like strategy.
[3:07:50] InvaderMig: Ok, dang was hoping to get a friend for some coop
[3:07:53] Uttrik: do you get different characters as you go, or are there like, separate stories with different parties?
[3:08:00] kalculate: There's a lot of depth.
[3:08:14] jellojacko: @AinzN thank you
[3:08:42] InvaderMig: this looks so cool though.  I'ma dota guy that only got into league about a year ago cuz of a friend, but this looks awesome, and arcane made me ove the world
[3:08:48] samael_40k: not finish just do a speed lane attack to remove the buff
[3:08:51] cleansock42: No point in saving ult it does not carry over
[3:08:52] Randomdude08: hit her with a speed before she dies to debuff it
[3:08:56] Sinnethx: no dispell her with speed attack first i think
[3:09:07] boki_86: so i really like the style of the game and i liked battle Chasers, i never played LoL. Does this game actually tell a good story?
[3:09:24] prfella: @boki_86 yes
[3:09:37] chrisknight27: yes
[3:09:38] AinzN: boki_86 seems good so far and I know nothing of League apart from what I saw in Arcane
[3:10:01] Darkaros: @InvaderMig I still wish the Dota anime featured someone besides the literal most boring hero in Dota stripGrump
[3:10:08] cleansock42: @boki_86 you do not need to know anything just like Arcane it is actually better to go in blind

[3:10:36] AinzN: Darkaros Viper is in the anime?
[3:10:51] boki_86: thanks chat
[3:11:15] SlipCrit: arent all the heros in dota boring?
[3:11:20] Darkaros: @AinzN don't diss Viper he'll fly into a rage *flaps angrily*
[3:11:21] Bearsquatch: excited to see boss fights
[3:11:24] SlipCrit: like their not really characters
[3:11:32] InvaderMig: makes me sad.  Riot is on fire man.  They decided november belongs to them
[3:11:32] ZeoBishop: i know nothing about dota or lol :)
[3:11:39] AinzN: SlipCrit Mortimer would like a word with you! ijpNO
[3:11:55] Darkaros: Lion's interesting. He went to hell and back. And back to hell and back again. Etc.
[3:11:58] DarrellBiggums: still cant get over how good arcane was
[3:12:26] InvaderMig: @itmeJP cuz I'ma dota guy and  i wish valve did more with what they have
[3:12:31] AinzN: Erin is back! ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE

[3:13:21] thejewk83: I like the look of this game a lot. Will have to wishlist it for when PoE is done with me.
[3:13:22] cleansock42: @InvaderMig Look at it this way with all the success Riot is getting it may just make Valve step up their game
[3:13:32] prfella: @potsey24 u should :)
[3:13:42] Potsey24: @prfella Awesome!
[3:13:50] zerohour_88: Valve doesn't care much about Dota, they're printing money with Steam LUL
[3:13:53] InvaderMig: @cleansock42 i'm not holding my breath.  They seem content with that steam money
[3:13:55] boki_86: the world seems so full of fantasy and magic, kinda weird that arcane is so grounded
[3:13:56] Darkaros: ijpHI This seems like a very good game so far, and JP enjoys it a lot.
[3:14:01] KaiserTheBlade: holy
[3:14:04] Darkaros: @dannytsocial JP has not found that mechanic yet
[3:14:08] Darkaros: !rk

[3:15:18] ZeoBishop: are all the story games going to be like this or will they be different have riot said?
[3:15:23] SaltyAsChuck: what? a non-crit? game is busted.. :(
[3:15:49] InvaderMig: And whoever said dota heros are boring, hell now.  Dota heros are amazing, as is the game. Rito is killing it right now though
[3:15:54] Moogles1: @Darkaros so he didnt explore the town got it
[3:16:25] zerohour_88: @InvaderMig Void Spirit was a masterclass in hero design, he's so good
[3:16:25] DeadlyBrother: @InvaderMig they don't have much lore to them do they?
[3:16:25] Moogles1: @ZeoBishop they showed like 3 games all diff
[3:16:52] arrrghy: lol
[3:16:55] onokat: @DeadlyBrother they all have lore attached to them
[3:17:00] zerohour_88: @InvaderMig they have lore, in fact LoL copied the dota style of lore before retconning everything to make an actual story
[3:17:01] 4pr0mille: Pierce Brosnan
[3:17:13] Darkaros: Dota characters have a lot of lore. Look up Bounty Hunter on the Dota 2 Wiki for example and he has "lore threads" connected to many characters, especially Dark Willow

[3:17:18] Taniem85: is that Liam O'Brien voicing the sword guy? sounds like it's just his Illidan voice
[3:17:21] InvaderMig: @DeadlyBrother there is quite a bit of lore actually, but they haven't done much with it other than that meh attempt at animation
[3:17:22] titanodin: cannon minion dat you?
[3:17:26] Darkaros: The problem is it's Dark Souls-style Lore and not stories; everything is in item pieces etc
[3:17:41] Darkaros: Phantom Assassin's Arcana lore is sick if you look that up, the twin swords thing.
[3:17:53] prfella: @taniem85 it is liam, and liam has voiced that sword guy since his debut in LoL
[3:17:56] Neragsito: also, how many ppl work on Dota? Riot has tons on League
[3:17:56] Datnade012: oh so this is battle chasers
[3:18:10] zerohour_88: they could've even make Rubick short series and it would've been more entertaining than DK
[3:18:30] Classoo: Does Yusuf shout Hasaki when he uses steel tempest?
[3:18:32] InvaderMig: @zerohour_88 agreed.
[3:18:38] Classoo: Yasuo*
[3:18:45] jmj1987: its just like squid game
[3:18:51] reminkly: @Classoo yea he does
[3:19:11] InvaderMig: Arcane is just on another level.  I wonder how much that show cost to make.
[3:19:16] zerohour_88: @Classoo that autocorrect LUL
[3:19:24] reminkly: @InvaderMig saw somewhere estimated ~10 mil per episode
[3:19:35] Neragsito: worth every penny
[3:19:39] InvaderMig: WUUUUUT  PogChamp
[3:20:00] prfella: @datnade012 @taniem85 and his debut was 8 yrs ago :)

[3:20:55] AinzN: ijpONO
[3:20:55] zerohour_88: KEKW that crit

[3:23:05] yrvengalied: its this thing
[3:23:18] Darkaros: teleport pylon hypeE
[3:23:27] yrvengalied: i think its the one that gives you an upgarded thing if you find it later
[3:23:27] prfella: @invadermig theres 6 possible party members
[3:23:28] Darksekrom: you have too look for it now
[3:23:32] Boonia: u gonna have to make sure u search for it
[3:23:34] ZeoBishop: welp
[3:23:36] yrvengalied: like in battle chasers
[3:23:39] titanodin: rip weapon
[3:23:40] titanodin: lol
[3:23:44] InvaderMig: @prfella oh nice
[3:23:52] Archangel3003: That's the same thing I put in there to test it LUL
[3:23:53] samael_40k: need to find it in this dungeon again to get it back
[3:24:19] samael_40k: random
[3:24:22] Mattt_CE: Hey all, how is the game? Worth the 30 bucks?
[3:24:23] InvaderMig: would i be ruining anything to discuss the playable characters???
[3:24:26] samael_40k: mine was at the very end
[3:24:32] Archangel3003: I've only used it once and then found it once so no idea
[3:24:35] MegaSpacePlayerXH: is this game made by the same devs as that Battlechasers game from a few years ago?
[3:24:36] Boonia: for me it went to by the finishing hole but not sure if its the same everytime
[3:24:47] Datnade012: @megaspaceplayerxh yes
[3:24:49] ljbrevoord: is it even still on this map, it didnt explain
[3:24:58] samael_40k: it was random in battlechasers
[3:25:05] Darkaros: Try not to talk about party members not in JP's party, I think. They're blatantly shown on the Ruined King website but eh, one of em's a mild surprise at this point
[3:25:34] samael_40k: yup
[3:25:35] Darksekrom: yes
[3:25:36] DeadlyBrother: yes
[3:25:42] Boonia: a lot
[3:25:48] InvaderMig: @Darkaros kk that's why I was asking
[3:25:51] Mattt_CE: lol
[3:26:03] Munetani_NJimha: coxJam
[3:26:19] Archangel3003: You got lucky there. I walked in and that thing started shooting me about 3 times before I got into combat LUL
[3:28:08] eLMaQ: Yasuo PogChamp
[3:28:11] Boonia: I wanna go a crit build on yasuo and just let him go wild
[3:28:19] titanodin: you can lure fights closer to each other to combine them for bonus xp
[3:28:49] InvaderMig: @Boonia playing yaso anything but wildly is blasphemy
[3:29:16] Shaolin91: poro mvp
[3:29:18] Darkaros: ohhh right Braum's passive to get a duder to go through smol things
[3:29:19] itsyuuge: is JP watching arcane
[3:29:35] Jukettaja: The game doesn't have quicksaves, does it?
[3:29:47] eLMaQ: @itsyuuge i think he is after act 2
[3:30:03] Boonia: it doesnt have quick save i wish it did would help with my playstye
[3:30:09] itsyuuge: arcane is the best show of 2021 imo
[3:30:29] Murdoc_c: looks repetitive on first glance, is it fun ?
[3:30:50] itsyuuge: getting good reviews
[3:30:55] InvaderMig: @itsyuuge year is not over, but so far it's in the running
[3:30:59] Jukettaja: Overkill
[3:31:04] Jukettaja: Oh.
[3:31:08] Jukettaja: That was underwhelming.
[3:31:30] titanodin: thats a ratJAM
[3:31:45] InvaderMig: that's yasuo diving in a 1v5 with only boots at the 3 min mark
[3:31:50] samael_40k: it's underwelming because you don't have enough crit on yasuo
[3:32:21] samael_40k: stacking crit on him makes him pop out
[3:32:36] titanodin: r3
[3:32:42] Darksekrom: i never saw that painting, i brute forced it open xd
[3:32:50] Sarcastard: r3 l2 r?

[3:36:58] eLMaQ: @Narnun 2nd, heroic is the hardest
[3:37:23] DeadlyBrother: Wasn't that hard for me
[3:37:30] DeadlyBrother: but i did side stuff
[3:37:44] MooseLounge: Little rough until the 4th party member
[3:37:45] Spawn83s: So this is normal?
[3:37:49] Narnun: So you can overlevel stuff? I played on normal
[3:37:57] Darkaros: This is 2nd hardest difficulty. There's 4 difficulties
[3:38:09] aznhai: watched bahroo get smacked around on a non-boss in heroic for a hour+; doesnt look fun
[3:38:13] Narnun: easy, normal, veteran, heroic?

[3:40:19] Woolfius_: it looks like basic fishing
[3:40:24] Norrak1: it's fairly simple, but the rewards can help a bunch on higher difficulty
[3:40:27] Jukettaja: That dead fish looks real imposing
[3:40:38] Jukettaja: Of all the undead you could summon
[3:40:44] Jukettaja: Fish was not what I was thinking
[3:41:06] Jukettaja: Imagine becoming a necromancer to summon dead fish

[3:41:11] ryukenchi: He got the wildcard shield buff
[3:41:13] Jukettaja: Or reanimate them anyway.
[3:41:28] Narnun: depends on how you spec her I think
[3:41:42] Narnun: cause she would have 3 all the time summoned when she got hit no?
[3:41:52] Jukettaja: @AinzN Fishbones are annoying you're right
[3:42:06] Dassiz: not really, its just more passives
[3:42:26] Narnun: if you remember old old old ass league, it's like passive trees
[3:42:56] InvaderMig: crit
[3:42:58] m3rcer: i went with crit cohhSuffer
[3:42:58] InvaderMig: i dont know
[3:42:59] OdinX1: Its a safe bet
[3:42:59] Akspert: crit
[3:43:00] Narnun: crit
[3:43:02] xmlgprorpx: crit
[3:43:03] Dassiz: always crit LUL
[3:43:04] Moogles1: crit
[3:43:06] OdinX1: You can also swap em out
[3:43:07] Norrak1: I just realized you actually activate the mastery category
[3:43:14] Norrak1: after playing 15 hours
[3:43:17] Narnun: yasuo has a 155 crit rate
[3:43:22] drunk814: do you have to put points in skills like in battle chasers or do they just unlock as you level up
[3:43:26] Zaelsus: some of his abilities go off crit too
[3:43:32] AinzN: Chat ijpNODDERS
[3:43:44] Norrak1: Yasuo can get ridiculous at 40+ Crit fairly easy
[3:43:45] Moogles1: his skills synergize off crit
[3:43:46] m3rcer: his abilties has bonus crit chance, you can spec crit buff for even more crit rooHappy
[3:44:04] Nogardknight: they unlock, but you spend skill points to specialize them
[3:44:08] Darkaros: you have skill points right? with the free respec thing?
[3:44:12] Narnun: yasuo is very crit focus even in league
[3:44:20] Nogardknight: so you always get base functionality
[3:44:22] Narnun: helps a bit to know how to build the characters in league
[3:44:41] Jukettaja: lol
[3:45:09] Kensei_Immortal: I might have to pick this up. Does it avoid the blandness of Battlechasers?
[3:45:13] Boonia: @itmejp try getting the 100% tenticle on illaoi i find it hepl with tenticle up time
[3:45:27] Jukettaja: You gave his sword away?
[3:45:29] Narnun: @Kensei_Immortal what do you mean by blandness? In what way?
[3:45:33] ZeoBishop: sword modCheck
[3:45:46] Nogardknight: there was a sword here, it's gone now
[3:45:50] AinzN: p5JAM p5JAM p5JAM
[3:45:58] ploki122: How's the game up to now, and how far along is he?
[3:46:00] Narnun: MOAR crit for yasuo POGGIES
[3:46:00] Kensei_Immortal: @Narnun I mean the ho hum story and not very interesting characters.
[3:46:14] Moogles1: callers hurt lol
[3:46:17] Greywolfe198: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[3:46:35] cuetreepie: Where did MF go in this story?
[3:46:36] Jukettaja: Kensei_Immortal That's probably subjective.
[3:46:37] Narnun: @Kensei_Immortal Yes, Riot's lore and high production help with both of those. It's still an indie game but the voice acting is good and the characters pretty cool
[3:46:51] spideycsa: MF returns around lvl 10ish or so
[3:47:00] Moogles1: she at her mansion helping bilgewater
[3:47:11] Norrak1: still on Veteran?
[3:47:11] Jukettaja: I do like that it's near fully voiced.

[3:47:17] Jukettaja: At least all the important dialogue is
[3:47:31] Narnun: I don't remember any non voice acted lines
[3:47:35] Narnun: what's not voiced?
[3:47:42] Moogles1: ya shadowcaller hits hard
[3:47:44] prfella: side quests

[3:47:55] Norrak1: Side quests and random NPCs in town
[3:47:58] Moogles1: there are some non voiced parts
[3:48:04] Narnun: oh ok
[3:48:04] Kensei_Immortal: @Narnun Yeah the League angle is why I ask. I bounced off League ages ago but appreciated the world they built.
[3:48:12] Norrak1: Camp banter, yellow spot banter, all main story, fully voiced
[3:48:13] Narnun: I just did normal very quickly
[3:48:16] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[3:48:21] ploki122: Wait wtf's that power/balance lane thingie?
[3:48:23] Jukettaja: Good grief
[3:48:26] Kensei_Immortal: Very happy to finally see them doing something with it.
[3:48:28] Jukettaja: He's gone
[3:48:28] Ippsi: Hmm
[3:48:35] Scout_6613: hmmm
[3:48:38] Spawn83s: Deeeead
[3:48:41] Nogardknight: braum just needs a little nap
[3:48:44] Norrak1: @ploki122 Main mechanic of the game
[3:48:59] Narnun: @ploki122 League easter egg. Speed lane gives you a quicker turn but a lesser hit, Power lane a longer turn but higher hit, balance is the middle
[3:49:05] InvaderMig: Pog
[3:49:12] FlipNest: is this on game pass?
[3:49:17] Narnun: depending on how you manage lanes you have those sections which give a random buff which you can land on
[3:49:30] Darkaros: !rk
[3:49:30] itmeBOT: Ruined King, made by the Battlechaser devs, was released November 16, 2021 on Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4/5, XBOX One, and Switch! JP is enjoying the game a lot and pleasantly surprised by its quality.
[3:49:31] ploki122: @Narnun ah, pretty cool way to not just be "basic Turn-based RPG"
[3:49:57] starclaws: guy with big ass shield takes more damage than katana guy
[3:50:04] Norrak1: @ploki122 it's also used for environmental hazard, some specific stance and ability. it's quite fun
[3:50:25] Jukettaja: That's true Braum takes like 130 damage while Yasuo takes 75
[3:50:28] Narnun: Braum needs some of his Tank passive tree
[3:50:30] ploki122: Yeah, lane abilities are restricted to a lane, that also makes a lot of sense
[3:50:40] Norrak1: Braum might need better gear, it changes a lot
[3:50:42] Narnun: also Braum has alot more HP than Yasuo
[3:50:56] Jukettaja: lol
[3:51:04] ploki122: report Braum for inting tbh...
[3:51:11] Scout_6613: slapped with a dead fish
[3:51:11] InvaderMig: LUL
[3:51:26] Darkaros: hypeE REPORT hypeE
[3:51:35] Narnun: yeah that's fishing
[3:51:43] iskavan1: @itmeJP have you had a good braum?
[3:51:47] DeadlyBrother: purple now
[3:51:47] Norrak1: it's epic now I think?
[3:51:52] Moogles1: shadowcaller just hits hard
[3:52:04] Boonia: I think the damamge wet up
[3:52:06] cleansock42: stats went from rare to epic
[3:52:07] BaronVonScufflebutt: its epic instead of rare
[3:52:10] Kaddhy_2k10: 92 crit

[3:53:55] Woolfius_: no fishing chat ijpSAD
[3:54:07] Moogles1: i guess jp didnt find the one in town that had stuff to fish with next to it
[3:54:08] BaronVonScufflebutt: check you might have a pole, i got one early on exploring
[3:54:12] StickGoku: !game

[3:54:19] Shadowner: the art seems good at least
[3:54:30] Norrak1: Friendly reminder to save often, the autosave can get iffy
[3:54:33] Narnun: the art and animations are pretty good

[3:54:36] Narnun: league's budget
[3:54:39] boki_86: just found out that Braum has the same voice actors as Vander in Arcane
[3:55:01] ploki122: @Narnun It's not really League's budget, they just publish it and help with creativ design.
[3:55:05] Narnun: Aren't a bunch of Critical Role VAs voicing this?
[3:55:15] Norrak1: I mainly use the Yasuo initiate as it's so wide hah
[3:55:24] Narnun: Yes but Riot seems very involved
[3:55:25] Shadowner: tarps
[3:55:35] Narnun: specially on the licensing aspects like Art Direction
[3:55:44] UnequaledTv: Is this full released?
[3:55:49] Narnun: yes
[3:55:57] eLMaQ: @UnequaledTv yep
[3:55:59] Narnun: fully release I believe on all platforms?

[3:56:23] Narnun: it's like 30$
[3:56:29] iskavan1: @Narnun well duh, they are the publisher
[3:56:44] Narnun: yeah but publisher can take a more hand on and hand off approach
[3:56:49] Narnun: and they also define the budget
[3:57:05] Moogles1: this game been full release for a week
[3:57:13] Narnun: Riot seems to have a hangs on approach, but still allowed the battlechasers crew to do their thing
[3:57:24] Scout_6613: wink wink
[3:57:25] Nogardknight: makes sense
[3:57:35] Jukettaja: I thought that sounded familiar
