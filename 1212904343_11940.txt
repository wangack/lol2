[3:19:32] GrittzNGravy: true whoever decided that would be the music deserves to be fired
[3:19:43] DangerRangerRex: That you continue to say Runed
[3:19:45] WilliamKurokami: yeah, it's weird. seems kinda bugged
[3:20:00] yrvengalied: yes
[3:20:03] summerspeak: that happens more than you would think
[3:20:05] yrvengalied: like me PepeLaugh
[3:20:06] ChiZWorkshop: I think Steam Achievements do that some times
[3:20:14] nobelustv: I bought it still meaning to pick up KEKW
[3:20:20] ChiZWorkshop: In New World I had an achievement for opening a supply crate that 0.1% of players had so...
[3:20:39] DagooX: I still haven't played Ghostrunner and I wanted to
[3:20:40] RlDennis: I think dark souls 1st death achievement was also kind of a weird percentage no?
[3:20:42] DangerRangerRex: Because Hecarim is a BOSS
[3:20:48] HairgelAddict: Buhru? The admiral?
[3:20:55] Flyspeck42: varus

[3:21:09] itmeBOT: Ruined King, made by the Battlechaser devs, was released November 16, 2021 on Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4/5, XBOX One, and Switch! JP is enjoying the game a lot and pleasantly surprised by its quality.
[3:21:24] SouthernBiscuits: braum is not a deft as he would think
[3:21:31] Pistollero1: Wait if Hecarim the undead horse person is dead? think we already got that answered right?
[3:23:10] Zaqster: this is a straight up full release? no early access?
[3:23:42] Pistollero1: Angler doggo
[3:23:57] Darkaros: yes Zaqster
[3:23:58] WilliamKurokami: basically the mimic of this game
[3:24:02] samael_40k: it's the chest mimic of this game i think @itmeJP
[3:24:07] wampastomppa: he tricked you buy having four legs instead of 0
[3:24:21] Zaqster: fighting doesn't seem my type of thing, but loving the atmosphere/artstyle
[3:24:36] Pistollero1: Also his light stalk is just straight up Na'vi
[3:24:39] Vipro24: One of the things i have to say as negative feedback for BF2042 is the very limited destruction. You could destroy a scyscraper in bf4 , cant even go through some walls in a tank in 2042. cohhFeels

[3:27:26] PissedOffWalrus: @Sonatta think of the gil you could make by selling all the shit in your inventory!
[3:27:36] Pistollero1: Yasuo dying to jungle creeps... troll picking jungler

[3:28:23] PissedOffWalrus: @Sonatta *could*

[3:51:39] someone_with_an_apple: what does overcharge do?
[3:51:40] kalculate: But I'll probably do more strongman later on with a little bit of the shield ones.
[3:51:44] kalculate: It's temp mana.
[3:51:52] ch0senpotato: @someone_with_an_apple i'm not 100% sure but it seems to stand in for mana

[3:53:44] kalculate: Yeah, its mainly the default attack, but you can get it with runes and skill upgrades.
[3:53:46] BroccoliTSKR: there are a few runes that can stock some between encounters
[3:54:11] kalculate: I always round-1 default just to have that 10 overcharge buffer.
[3:54:26] Darkaros: @thetruesl4v Ya. Riot published the game but someone else developed it. Like how movie games aren't made by movie makers :p

[4:15:41] SirSamVimes: @identityuknwn love the incredibly complex series of emotions that runs through jinx's face when ekko starts twitching his watch
[4:16:26] helboy1111: Would there be any big penalty if braum died there?
[4:16:29] Aboostin: @SirSamVimes that scene, chillin
[4:16:38] BroccoliTSKR: @helboy1111 none at all
[4:16:46] ch0senpotato: you dont need to rez if you can win the fight
[4:16:49] identityuknwn: its so good
[4:16:52] ch0senpotato: but you do need to use heal pots after
[4:16:57] Nogardknight: the penalty is needing to use your action to get them up
[4:17:01] SirSamVimes: the game is challenging but not punishing, in my experience
[4:17:04] Darkaros: Ya on a "strategic" level this game is very forgiving
[4:17:32] helboy1111: aight thx! :)
[4:17:42] ch0senpotato: you can win the fight with one champ standing, the others get up after
[4:17:45] Nogardknight: yeah, you generally have plenty of resources, but the ways in which you can utilize them at any one time is limited
[4:17:49] ch0senpotato: but they get up with low hp
[4:18:21] baldded: @itmejp - nice stream mate. Question: Would you recommend this game on the Switch?
[4:19:13] Daikurou: if its the only platform you can see yourself playing on, then yes, the load times are awful but otherwise is plays fine @baldded
[4:20:06] Daikurou: also ive been crashing alot on switch, dunno if thats a software or hardware issue tho
[4:20:09] baldded: @sataruyamate thanks. I have a pc but it seems like a nice game to “carry along” I have a Switch lite btw
[4:20:56] Whiskeydog23: @itmeJP anymore champs since Yassuo?
[4:20:58] Daikurou: i only got it on switch because for some reason i didnt think it was gonna be on ps5
[4:21:01] Boonia: Yas crit buff is so good
[4:21:11] Aboostin: he's typing
[4:21:17] Darkaros: not yet Whiskeydog23
[4:21:22] Daikurou: well, ps4, but playable on ps5
[4:21:29] identityuknwn: Jp out of curiosity are you planning on going back to SMT?
[4:22:39] identityuknwn: oh interesting ok
[4:22:48] Milkaddict221: is this game free?
[4:22:51] identityuknwn: no
[4:23:16] PenguinPowered: better clear dem debuffs :)
[4:23:29] DangerRangerRex: Not uncommon, fan base of SMT is kinda split that way you can like both but definitely have a clear preference for Main Line vs Persona games
[4:24:05] Darkaros: Hhhehehe
[4:24:10] Daikurou: im def on SMT side, but i mean, its not like persona games havent had dark stories, just a light hearted way of telling it
[4:24:10] lil_kidney69: That was funny :)
[4:24:11] Brmbrmduc: KEKW
[4:24:13] identityuknwn: GET IYT

[4:24:49] Flyspeck42: CATBEDOINGTHELAUNDRY why isn't this christmas themed
[4:24:51] Sonatta: it's not even thanksgiving yet peepoLeave
[4:24:53] scooterjr37: that's why i always ban yasuo
[4:24:56] Darkaros: ijpHMM nope, a christmas lizard doesn't exist.
[4:25:02] identityuknwn: when yas crits he goes hard
[4:25:06] ch0senpotato: yasuo is 500x more effective in your team than mine
[4:25:08] Darkaros: HHHOP does though ( Hhhehehe + ppHop )
[4:25:26] leluminai: leluminai subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:25:26] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing leluminai! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[4:25:30] Sonatta: can't you put the santa hat on the Hhhehehe
[4:25:31] DangerRangerRex: I am firmly on the SMT side. But I can see how making the world/characters more relatable with the lens of persona makes many people enjoy it more. It can have some dark motiffs but SMT mainline definitely goes to some dark places.
[4:25:33] Boonia: Caht question is it better to try to chain battles or do one at a time
[4:25:35] shywolf: cohhSpy
[4:25:38] Boonia: *Chat
[4:25:54] ThatGunsFoHire: I'm sure by actual christmas someone can whip up a lizard
[4:25:56] Darkaros: uhhh it was his stacking resource, there ya go
[4:26:00] SirSamVimes: flow gives him a shield when he crits
[4:26:06] Darkaros: It says right there
[4:26:08] Boonia: Flow gives a shield and crit i thinik
[4:26:09] DangerRangerRex: It makes you talk smooth and fast
[4:26:10] SirSamVimes: or rather it gives him a shield when an enemy hits him after he crits
[4:26:14] Daikurou: yea, its how he gets his shield
[4:26:15] Darkaros: On da Passive
[4:26:29] SirSamVimes: it's how he doesn't die with his miniscule health pool
[4:26:41] AinzN: Some ask for a lizard in a hat? ainznZilla
[4:27:06] skywi5e: I don't see Tales of Arise on the list of upcoming games. Is it a matter of limited time availability or lack of interest?
[4:27:17] identityuknwn: @DangerRangerRex I actually have never played an SMT game on P3-5
[4:27:23] zerohour_88: @Skywi5e he finished it
[4:27:23] Daikurou: rip Feral Flare
[4:27:25] Darkaros: @Skywi5e he finished it stripStare
[4:27:26] Boonia: @Skywi5e he completed it
[4:27:44] skywi5e: Oh....
[4:27:46] skywi5e: nvm
[4:27:47] Darkaros: It's on YouTube and everything
[4:28:44] Jukettaja: lol
[4:28:45] DangerRangerRex: @identityuknwn There were not any. SMT 3: Nocturn is PS2 SMT 4 was 3DS and it looks like Nintendo is gonna keep the mainline games for the forseeable future
[4:28:46] skywi5e: @Darkaros Thanks! Will check it out.

[4:31:11] ch0senpotato: midori no turtle
[4:31:19] DangerRangerRex: @identityuknwn So Sorry! Completely misunderstood. Not the first time this week either lol. If you like Persona you will find a lot of the same things gameplay wise in SMT.  The story will be NOTHING like it though. So I encourage you to try it if that sounds like something you would enjoy. But it also my not be and that is completely fine too
[4:32:58] Boonia: I guess I was underlvl this guy almost destroyed me
[4:33:55] Sylnix: everything destroy you in Heroic

[4:37:11] Boonia: This game is making me love Braum and Illaoi a little to much
[4:37:27] DangerRangerRex: There is much to love with Braum and Illaoi
[4:37:30] broo_kay: @Boonia Impossible, no such thing
[4:37:50] ch0senpotato: uhoh
[4:37:56] weertangel: This is a fun game, am having a blast with it.
[4:38:03] Flyspeck42: vashj Pog
[4:38:06] SirSamVimes: Not a League champion
[4:38:14] weertangel: Its the naga from the lore u just collected.
[4:38:17] ch0senpotato: oh yeah this is the first time i died!
[4:38:26] ch0senpotato: this boss was the first one to kill me
[4:38:33] SirSamVimes: Looks more like Azshara than Vashj

[4:39:09] Darkaros: peepoClap
[4:39:14] weertangel: I had fun with it, by this time i knew what to do and it went wild on her :)
[4:39:25] r_o_o_k_i_e: hahaha i just got pass this boss too^^ tricky 1
[4:39:27] ch0senpotato: couldn't find the debuff
[4:39:29] r_o_o_k_i_e: amesome game
[4:39:29] ch0senpotato: braum had it
[4:39:57] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:40:22] weertangel: i built Braum into a mean tank,taking all the hits, as long as he gets healed once in a while.
[4:40:39] ch0senpotato: braum is super powerful late
[4:41:03] samael_40k: yasuo can
[4:41:12] samael_40k: has 1 skill that does
[4:41:15] weertangel: u'll figure it out ;)
[4:41:21] ch0senpotato: braum's punch is a debuff
[4:41:42] samael_40k: god this fight took so long for me
[4:41:48] samael_40k: ez but oh so long
[4:42:13] weertangel: na, just up the combat speed and keep whaling ont he adds, that worked.
[4:42:30] r_o_o_k_i_e: i had the samurais last lane skilled for debuff
[4:42:31] samael_40k: having weapons with debuff stats on it sure helps with this fight
[4:42:39] Docta_G: Concussion does count
[4:42:46] ch0senpotato: concussion applies more debuff stacks when you apply consecutive hits with other champions
[4:43:07] Boonia: did that kill do 1000 damage
[4:43:09] weertangel: I enchanted all my gear at this point, the damage was insane! i was even able to get past the boss's damage reduction!
[4:43:19] Darkaros: D:
[4:43:25] afreak10: D:
[4:43:25] Flyspeck42: D:

[4:43:36] applebananacake: language
[4:43:39] samael_40k: oh yeah debuff enchants also help with this
[4:43:56] afreak10: cohhBless cohhBless
[4:43:58] Radcosh: bless you
[4:44:27] SirSamVimes: it was a very intentional decision to have this mechanic happen when it's impossible to not have braum in your party, because it would be MUCH harder without concussion
[4:44:28] Radcosh: good night JP and chat. enjoy the game!
[4:44:37] Boonia: yas and braum coming in clutch
[4:44:38] weertangel: it does
[4:44:48] Darkaros: @Radcosh ijpHI later!
[4:45:06] SirSamVimes: if you'd targeted the minion with that ult, it would have been a deathblow to the boss
[4:45:16] ch0senpotato: nice gg wp
[4:45:19] Brmbrmduc: EZ Clap
[4:45:22] sapu_123: EZ Clap
[4:45:22] weertangel: see? not that bad.

[4:45:41] ShrowdArrow: ijpEZ Clap
[4:45:54] afreak10: Clap Clap
[4:46:08] ryukenchi: you can only choose 1 loot? or do you get all of them?
[4:46:09] Korregidor: how's the game chat?
[4:46:14] sapu_123: true godess is back, everything fine, heroes go home and have a nice dinner
[4:46:14] ch0senpotato: this has similar themes to ori, running amok purifying everything you see
[4:46:38] SirSamVimes: @ryukenchi you get it all
[4:46:43] Darkaros: JP is still enjoying the game a lot and is tempted to play it offline
[4:46:49] SirSamVimes: illaoi likes the large men
[4:46:50] Boonia: Gp and Illaoi used t fk
[4:46:58] r_o_o_k_i_e: sm1 knows how to get the treasure out of that little fenced whole 2 rooms befor? that which is to small for a person but u cant push ur hamster through?
[4:47:07] SirSamVimes: @r_o_o_k_i_e can't yet
[4:47:12] r_o_o_k_i_e: aaaaa
[4:47:15] r_o_o_k_i_e: ok thx
[4:47:34] SirSamVimes: guessing poros can't swim
[4:47:51] r_o_o_k_i_e: ^^
[4:47:53] ch0senpotato: how has braum not heard of gangplank he faces him every day on summoners rift
[4:48:00] Shazzaa95: Are you enjoying this game JP?
[4:48:31] Darkaros: JP is still enjoying the game a lot and is tempted to play it offline
[4:49:04] weertangel: This is just the right game i needed to get a break from some stuff, just refreshing
[4:49:41] KillikaBeast: @symbomorph Thanks for the gift sub! ijpLOVE
[4:49:42] SirSamVimes: that's part of what being a truth seeker is about
[4:50:01] AshLike: she did not test Anthem
[4:50:12] Nogardknight: yaharharhar
[4:50:14] Cardsharp: Good evening JP and Chat!  Everyone ready to stuff our faces at Thanksgiving?
[4:50:15] Boonia: gotta say GP looks real menacing in this game
[4:50:17] drax_is_king: who is that hero?
[4:50:18] Darkaros: Walks into your favorite drinking establishment. Pours sacred snake bath water on another patron claiming it's a test. Kills him, leaves, refuses to elaborate further.
[4:50:18] Kymix: Damn, what happened in Top lane
[4:50:19] Woolfius_: ah good ol critplank cocoGasm
[4:50:24] Darkaros: @drax_is_king Illiao
[4:50:31] Hangfish: Critplank is bestplank
[4:50:43] Hangfish: I remember when you could drink your survey and just run at people :(
[4:50:45] weertangel: Well, i'm off. have alot of fun with the game JP and u guys as well :) thuluHEY
[4:50:50] notlongtillDawn: Oranges?
[4:50:51] Korregidor: excuse me bankplank is bestplank
[4:50:52] PenguinPowered: thanks for nothing, spirit
[4:50:56] Hangfish: scurvey*
[4:51:02] RealLifeNoRespawn: i just got to this exact point like 10 minutes ago, and i'm surprised how much im enjoying ruined king tbh
[4:51:06] SirSamVimes: the grate in the temple? not yet
[4:51:08] RealLifeNoRespawn: i thought the slower gameplay would turn me off
[4:51:14] Kymix: Excuse me, wankplank is bestplank
[4:51:14] Hangfish: Just crit and Q.
[4:51:35] Nogardknight: i think the recipe is a visual bug
[4:51:39] Boonia: u got the recipe it doesnt leave the map
[4:51:42] SirSamVimes: @RealLifeNoRespawn the double speed mode helps for when you're just going through random encounters
[4:51:47] broo_kay: those are bugged rn
[4:51:47] Sylnix: yeah was a bug for me too
[4:51:49] BroccoliTSKR: there are a few marks on the map that are bugged
[4:52:10] RealLifeNoRespawn: SirSamVimes it's not the speed of the animations, the gameplay is just super slow. i'm really enjoying it though. it's a great change of pace
[4:52:26] Daikurou: its like places you do to fast travel. like in town its the airships or whatever
[4:52:27] broo_kay: no, you gotta hoof it
[4:52:31] Boonia: u can fast travel by the blimps to certain points
[4:52:34] SirSamVimes: oh, you mean turn based combat in general? they do a good job of making it fun and engaging
[4:52:52] RealLifeNoRespawn: no b/c like ffx is turn based but still feels fast and fluid
[4:52:58] RealLifeNoRespawn: ruined king is more strategic
[4:53:02] ch0senpotato: on the map there were two chests side by side at the end of a corridor in one of the last areas. i could see one but not the other, wondered if bringing MF might show it because she can discover more things?
[4:53:05] r_o_o_k_i_e: not rested monkaS
[4:53:05] RealLifeNoRespawn: there's a ton of options
[4:53:35] Darkaros: Careful speculating stuff that JP hasn't accomplished himself yet ijpSIP
[4:53:44] ch0senpotato: sorry
[4:53:51] sireful: Which reminds me of how Square-Enix has basically been preaching that nobody really enjoys turn based games.
[4:53:58] r_o_o_k_i_e: all crits :O
[4:54:01] r_o_o_k_i_e: niiiice
[4:54:02] Hangfish: Yasuo broken here to KEKW
[4:54:14] SirSamVimes: yasuo only does one thing: damage
[4:54:16] SirSamVimes: but he does it very well
[4:54:20] ShockuhZuluu: catJAM
[4:54:32] ShockuhZuluu: This music is great
[4:54:59] Boonia: @SirSamVimes he also lives in some ridiculous situations
[4:55:05] k0jak: cold weather yardwork is peak living
[4:55:24] RealLifeNoRespawn: feels so strange having yasuo being super nice AND actually carrying, as compared to lol games LUL
[4:56:07] ch0senpotato: i permaban yasuo
[4:56:32] SirSamVimes: I permaban fizz when I'm mid lane
[4:56:45] Nogardknight: yasuo hit his 0/7 powerspike in this canon when he killed his brother
[4:56:45] RealLifeNoRespawn: oh shit i didnt know that guy sold meals
[4:57:09] SirSamVimes: though when I bot lane I ban yuumi, just as much to prevent my support from taking her as the enemy team
[4:57:15] RealLifeNoRespawn: there's so many characters that can kill you in .3 seconds LUL
[4:57:17] SirSamVimes: yuumi existing on either team makes bot lane less fun
[4:58:13] ch0senpotato: ever ban someone and your teammate goes "WTF why ban him i feed" even when they didnt pick him
[4:58:45] RealLifeNoRespawn: there's definitely a group of ppl that just look for any excuse to ruin other people's games
[4:58:58] RealLifeNoRespawn: they dont value their time at all LUL
[4:59:25] Zumorikato_: Yeap... A salty bread LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:59:29] thesestrangenotions: how accessible is LoL to someone who has never played MOBAs or anything similar? I'm interested but find it daunting like PoE
[4:59:39] RealLifeNoRespawn: it's gotten better in recent years though
[4:59:44] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[4:59:46] RealLifeNoRespawn: thesestrangenotions if u play for fun it's super accessible
[4:59:47] SirSamVimes: it's moderately daunting
[4:59:48] The_Enygma: LoL is very accessible. it's just toxic af
[4:59:55] Darkaros: ijpHMM Pretty daunting if you don't play either RTS or Mobas
[5:00:02] RealLifeNoRespawn: if you want to get really good, it will take a lot of time and effort
[5:00:05] activatesalvaticus: 5-6 months to learn everything
[5:00:08] arrrghy: crazy beings
[5:00:08] SirSamVimes: there's a lot of characters to learn, but they've made it easier to introduce builds with the reworked shop
[5:00:11] Nogardknight: there's a huge barrier of knowledge to start, but the basics are fairly easy to grasp
[5:00:11] Darkaros: It's kinda freaky seeing someone who hasn't played either genre not adapt to the movement style
[5:00:13] ryukenchi: league is fucked
[5:00:14] zerohour_88: yeah, MOBA toxicity is something else, gameplay you can learn and so
[5:00:16] Junithorn: League is nowhere near as daunting as PoE but I like HoTS as a very simple intro to the MOBA genre
[5:00:25] SirSamVimes: the shop now generally suggests good items for you if you're a newbie
[5:00:39] empeajay: empeajay subscribed with Prime. 
[5:00:39] itmeBOT: Welcome to itmeNATION empeajay ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[5:00:46] shywolf: yes
[5:00:55] RealLifeNoRespawn: yea there's a very nice depth to the game
[5:01:00] ranin: HoTS and pokemon unite probably the easiest to get into, then maybe lol and last dota
[5:01:05] RealLifeNoRespawn: the equipment system is cool as heck too
[5:01:08] thesestrangenotions: Lmao I get it
[5:01:34] Laser_SeQ: and i got the LoL series ad xD talk about the devil
[5:01:39] 1TrueTyrant: The main thing about League is you have to put in a lot of time engraving mechanics into you before you get good(unless your a natural or have previous experience in similar games), the rest is all mental fortitude(ignore the toxicity) either that or play with a group of friends and just have fun :)
[5:02:00] ch0senpotato: i start off thinking "i'm in a really solid mood i won't react to anyone" then after 5 days i start getting toxic like everyone else as a defence mechanism...

[5:03:12] Daikurou: there was a really bad issue with the starting combat. on switch i had a problems with the next major zone jp is going to, but they patched and it fixed
[5:03:14] ch0senpotato: all it takes is for someone to say "bot diff" and you start thinking of ways to deflect
[5:03:19] ch0senpotato: if you're bot
[5:03:42] RealLifeNoRespawn: adc is the worst role
[5:03:55] The_Enygma: nah I think it's jungler.
[5:04:05] SirSamVimes: all roles are fun imo
[5:04:05] RealLifeNoRespawn: ur completely dependent on your team to protect you while the entire enemy team is trying to kill you
[5:04:08] ch0senpotato: everyone blames jungle too

[5:08:06] Daikurou: yea, there are a bunch
[5:08:20] SirSamVimes: some of the sidequests are really fun and interesting and worth doing onscreen imo
[5:08:23] Daikurou: like 5 before going to MF before going to the area you just cleared
[5:08:33] Jukettaja: I like that low level enemies run from you
[5:08:38] Darkaros: Fate/Grand Order PADORUPADORU
[5:08:57] Daikurou: at least it isnt genshin
[5:09:13] Darkaros: Genshin is dead until tomorrow when the patch arrives
[5:09:14] ワフルデラ: Fate is arguably more predatory
[5:09:25] zerohour_88: FGO is like way worse LUL
[5:09:32] ワフルデラ: as someone who has two FGO accounts
[5:09:38] Daikurou: yea but the characters are superior

[5:10:08] ワフルデラ: FGO is no auto battle
[5:10:08] DeadlyBrother: And i wanted to hear u talk about this game PepeHands
[5:10:09] Darkaros: coxMuppet Wow I guess Cohh hates DF he only showed up once and then left again /s
[5:10:13] ワフルデラ: but you do have units like Gilgamesh
[5:10:22] Darkaros: Ya FGO infamously has no autobattling (cept 3rd party stuff)
[5:10:24] ワフルデラ: that are like once every couple years featured in a banner
[5:10:42] PhoenixMD: She sank his battleship

[5:12:22] PhoenixMD: First rule of Zombieland
[5:12:27] Goody2Slippers: I like the level of polish Riot commits to, but I wish they'd move away from the LoL IP with some of it.
[5:13:15] zerohour_88: @Goody2Slippers that's crazy talk, all the retcon they did with the lore is totally to make more games with the same IP LUL
