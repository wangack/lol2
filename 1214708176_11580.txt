[3:26:18] afreak10: cohhSus
[3:26:49] issalga: I haven't seen much of the game but does the walking speed feel a bit slow?
[3:27:12] Darkaros: LUL
[3:27:15] Tronmakers: do you need to know anything about leage of legends to play this?
[3:27:26] MagisterGir: @issalga there's a running speed as well if you use it. Walking speed is slow though ye
[3:27:41] JohnMork: I'm just glad for ways to see more of the world without having to touch League

[3:35:07] m3rcer: @markbart1 3 at a time yeah. you can swap ppl at certain spots
[3:35:13] Darkaros: PepeLaugh because you're banning lux instead
[3:35:29] cyberronic: so riot is shaping the meta of lol with those games Hmm
[3:35:52] zAntidome: magic is banned in demacia
[3:35:53] markbart1: @m3rcer oh so you dont have complete freedom with your party?
[3:35:53] m3rcer: yes magic is big no no in demacia
[3:36:17] m3rcer: @markbart1 if u mean to use all at once or change whenever then yeah no
[3:36:19] Doomwyte: except for Lux, damn hypocrites Kappa
[3:36:22] Reaviar: magic is big no in demacia....unless youre a noble then they just ignore it
[3:36:35] MugenRichie: Magic is a big no period in Demacia
[3:36:42] zAntidome: lux hides her magic
[3:36:46] sPoiLeD_de: time to smite and ignite ~
[3:36:47] m3rcer: wasnt the lore for Lux that she hides her magic?
[3:36:55] markbart1: @m3rcer change your entire party make up at will is what i meant. gotcha. cheers
[3:36:57] cri_hard: Yeah garen’s ult can be considered magic LUL
[3:37:17] cherry_badger: Clap
[3:37:19] zAntidome: its also why sylas is so angry
[3:37:25] Tronmakers: its nice that the away members seem to get xp too
[3:37:33] MugenRichie: yeah Lux basically showed her magic for the first time in that Warriors cutscene
[3:37:41] Doomwyte: except for that one cutscene fro like a year ago where she ults the fuck outta sylas army and then galio and garen gotta save her LUL
[3:37:51] MugenRichie: and Sylas is mad because he was a mage but there was tension between the mage's guild and the state
[3:38:10] MugenRichie: up until a point where multiple murders happened and Sylas was blamed for it so they imprisoned him
[3:38:43] MugenRichie: he was teaching Lux about magic until a point where she was strong enough where he could steal her ult and escape the prison
[3:38:55] cri_hard: Theres a fiddlesticks reference here somewhere but not sure if jp has encountered it yet
[3:39:39] m3rcer: KEKW
[3:39:54] JohnMork: So is this just on a different continent from Arcane, or are there different/alternate universes too?
[3:39:58] MugenRichie: I don't think Sylas was completely innocent in that situation but the tension between mage hating population and mages was too high
[3:40:02] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:40:47] MagisterGir: prolly not since Shadow Isles really don't have anything to do with Arcanes current events.

[3:41:27] HighLord_PanCake: we got slight setup for noxus and zaun, so im hoping for urgot :D
[3:41:28] Doomwyte: we all know noxus is the real enemy
[3:41:34] JohnMork: Huh, that's awesome though. I'm looking forward to all of these Riot Forge games to expand on things, Arcane was so fantastic
[3:41:42] MagisterGir: Season 3 would have to be a very big time skip then from what's happening and the story it's focusing on.
[3:41:47] m3rcer: when muh boy Viktor cohhFeels

[3:46:25] m3rcer: yep
[3:46:35] m3rcer: cause the timer on it doesnt reset when you get into a fight
[3:46:50] MagisterGir: @Tronmakers don't think so, only digital copies so far.
[3:47:34] Tronmakers: @Tronmakers thank you. I was hoping to grab a physical copy if i got in on console. oh well
[3:48:08] m3rcer: iirc they hit harder too

[3:54:05] Miros__: @Darkaros Brutal. Savaged. Wrecked.
[3:54:06] Viriskali15: it's like people think if they come in immediately negative you will pivot to doing what they want
[3:54:09] copycoffeecat: there is a pirate dog holding a bomb. what is not to like about that?
[3:54:20] appaomega: You can use just quick strike with fast combat

[4:01:07] Jubiiq: 5-8 30sec long ads every 25mins...Twitch starts to be unwatchable:/ @itmejp
[4:01:29] Darkaros: Should be every hour, not 25min ijpHMM Twitch has been doing funky shit with ads though
[4:01:40] Jubiiq: yeah
[4:01:49] zechetto: lol
[4:02:01] Jubiiq: @itmejp I'm on phone :D
[4:02:01] titanodin: @itmeJP good evening
[4:02:10] sarqon: i watched a stream the other day and there weren't any ads at all
[4:02:12] Darkaros: Ya, Twitch's war vs adblock is continuing. Lately subs with adblock on have been getting ads LUL
[4:02:36] Darkaros: (as an unintended bug)
[4:02:40] Jubiiq: but it happens every couple days, like app getting to weird loop and just start ads too often
[4:02:51] Viriskali15: I wish twitch would get the watch feature figured out on the PS app
[4:02:57] Tronmakers: @Darkaros so subs are having to turn off some adblock programs to get the adless experience they paid for?
[4:03:12] Segatron_the_Dreamcaster: or the website thinks you have adblock.  In which case the 25 minute timer is just spite
[4:03:19] Viriskali15: are all of the characters relatively balanced?
[4:03:43] Darkaros: ijpNODDERS This is the 2nd time this has happened in a year where their anti-adblock stuff has false positives
[4:03:46] Jubiiq: @segatron_the_dreamcaster but I'm on my phone, so no adblock at all

[4:04:07] Mayshar: My only true complaint about twitch ads if i accept they have to have them, is running ads over live content is REALLY fucking stupid
[4:04:15] Ahoy_NATO: I've heard Ahri is pretty busted compared to the others from ability
[4:04:18] Viriskali15: I'm surprised by how long this game is
[4:04:24] afreak10: cohh7
[4:04:31] titanodin: @itmeJP sorry i forgot, did you ever check out league wild rift skins and the UI
[4:04:49] Darkaros: D:

[4:05:41] RCloud7: Miss Fortune = Laura Bailey <3
[4:06:07] afreak10: Hmm Hmm
[4:06:16] Segatron_the_Dreamcaster: @jubiiq I was adressing the flaw in the system.  I dont have ad block either, but half of the websites I visit accuse me of it.
[4:06:26] La_Fourmi: idk I refused and nothing special for me
[4:06:27] titanodin: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3 i dunno

[4:14:44] Starbuk: You have to save all your potions, you never know when you might need them. I'm personally saving all of mine for the next game

[4:15:30] titanodin: now i wonder if that has been the case.... atleast once in history
[4:15:31] Doomwyte: walk into the last boss with full inventory and just 1 shot it LUL
[4:15:31] SMonTwitch: if you use pots, are you even playing a jrpg?
[4:15:31] SEye6: I am sure the DLC will be hard lots of potions needed
[4:15:32] eLMaQ: NODDERS
[4:15:34] MooseLounge: Can say, this is one of the few games where I abused potions later
[4:15:35] afreak10: NODDERS NODDERS
[4:15:38] Darkaros: NODDERS Save carries over, just like in Mass Effect, hoard everything
[4:15:42] geoffsgayestfan: that was the shiva snap
[4:15:47] JeXus1985: See, I'm the other way, I crushed a firekeeper soul for souls in my first dark souls playthrough. It hurt, but it helped me with my problem of hoarding items

[4:17:58] m3rcer: ah the dog thing
[4:18:05] Boonia: yea fk him
[4:18:10] m3rcer: with the aoe bleed?
[4:18:18] kalculate: I think I was overleveled.
[4:18:33] kalculate: It was easy for me, but I was also on Normal.
[4:18:50] Darkaros: nah gotta save those pots for rk2
[4:18:53] LostBrotherK: gotta hoard though
[4:18:58] Boonia: oh I'm stupid i never used a potion
[4:18:59] Archershot: braum ult cleanses as well
[4:19:00] yumadarr: or cleanse on her aoe heal
[4:19:13] Ahoy_NATO: I've been so stingy with potions, probs why I'm losing fights all the time on Heroic
[4:19:14] kalculate: @Archershot Yeah that was pretty useful.
[4:19:46] Darkaros: Battlechaser devs definitely seem to have a "use it don't hoard" gameplay design with the enchantment stuff going obsolete too
[4:19:49] Archershot: tbh i've been using braum, illaoi and a random dps the whole game. really difficult to die
[4:19:58] Boonia: Did u blow up the rock and hit the seagul in that dungeon?
[4:20:00] m3rcer: opening critties danGachi
[4:20:08] Viriskali15: y'all, I just wanna play League

[4:20:46] Starbuk: Braum is good in speed runs of this game, Braum and Yasuo just buff Pyke and he can one shot most anything
[4:20:47] SMonTwitch: Has anyone played this on switch? perform okay?
[4:20:49] W_Tile: ah bummer, a good braum is sexy af
[4:20:49] titanodin: i have seen braums 1v1 adcs all the time but i never seen a full on carry
[4:20:50] nightsreach: have you ever had a support carry you in your elo? :P
[4:20:57] Mayshar: Late game here Braum gets op with shields
[4:21:10] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Yone and Yasuo needs to fuck off with the extra Crit gain on items...
[4:21:17] titanodin: LUL

[4:23:46] AinzN: Moogles1 isthat because you couldn't farm coffee biscuits for lots ofmoney?
[4:24:00] Viriskali15: so, are poros sentient, or are they animals?
[4:24:06] m3rcer: yes
[4:24:22] SMonTwitch: AinzN NODDERS false advertising if you ask me
[4:24:28] geoffsgayestfan: @ryukenchi silver is the second lowest rank in league, means the  person's commentary is probably bad
[4:24:43] MugenRichie: silver is actually 3rd lowest
[4:24:53] Viriskali15: I bet it's a really hearty stew
[4:24:54] ryukenchi: ah. lol thanks @geoffsgayestfan thats funny

[4:52:34] Seansky33: bad fight for ill
[4:52:35] kibriel: this game needs a quicksave BAD
[4:52:54] Madracah: @itmeJP looks like a no illaoi fight. her Tentacles are making it much worse.
[4:52:57] cleansock42: its all skip able cut scenes
[4:53:00] Zaelsus: the tentacles really mess things up
[4:53:10] HibitusHabitus: Each DOT hit applies a stack too
[4:53:15] cleansock42: you can
[4:54:03] kibriel: stifles flute scabbard jokes
[4:54:07] GeorgeMt10: i believe
[4:54:08] Darkaros: which button to skip on controller Hmm
[4:54:11] cleansock42: just tap and use Heart Break shot with MF the fight is easy doing that
[4:54:16] SkotimusPrime: Kickass, JP! You can do it!.....I guess, maybe, whatever

[4:54:59] Madracah: is there a Dispell abbility ?
[4:55:09] ファ労苦: maybe just braum instead of dmg?
[4:55:13] Boldie117: There are moves that remove buffs on enemies but idk if it would be 1 stack at a time or not.
[4:55:17] opshrus: yasuo wind wall?
[4:55:20] yumadarr: try and use big single attacks over multi hit attacks

[4:55:50] Shenseiken: Are you forced to use her because Brom is sea sick?
[4:56:36] Madracah: looks like a Heart Seeker only fight
[4:56:38] m3rcer: the aoe lane push isnt multi hit
[4:56:57] Archershot: illaoi can remove buffs from enemys
[4:57:21] kuzyamada: I usually run braums big ass shields
[4:57:25] Boonia: can u strip the buff?
[4:57:34] applebananacake: yes
[4:57:48] Archershot: yeah you can do it with all stacking buffs in the game
[4:58:02] applebananacake: also every champ can remove debuff
[4:58:13] m3rcer: hold up
[4:58:26] m3rcer: can you inspect the frenzy buff real quick?
[4:58:39] Darkaros: You can see it top right just then
[4:58:41] Darkaros: Or here
[4:58:53] m3rcer: huh weird when i did this fight
[4:58:58] m3rcer: it would reset everytime he did an attack
[4:59:09] thekeytovectorsigma: Shouldn't those stacks go away after 1 turn?
[4:59:10] konvay: it says "for 1 attack", yeah
[4:59:19] Ahoy_NATO: yeah it seems to not be resetting for some reason
[4:59:19] m3rcer: i think this is bugged
[4:59:30] m3rcer: it supposed to reset after every of the bosses attack
[4:59:38] Boldie117: I didnt have this much trouble with this guy, I dont recall him stacking this much.
[4:59:45] Thesummerofkevin: i swear it went away when i fought him
[4:59:57] Darkaros: did his frenzy stacks just disappear there
[5:00:03] thekeytovectorsigma: they're gone now
[5:00:07] m3rcer: yeah it supposed to reset everytime the boss does an attack

[5:00:12] Darkaros: ya... stripHmm it didn't reset when he did the breathe attack earlier
[5:00:21] Darkaros: maybe because breathe attack wasn't AP?

[5:01:02] Boldie117: Perhaps its on cooldown Hmm
[5:01:05] Nogardknight: I don't think there's a magic power stat, so attack power works on all damage
[5:01:15] m3rcer: atk pwr scales everything basically
[5:01:24] m3rcer: regardless of dmg type
[5:02:05] m3rcer: cause the stack actually reset yeah danKEK
[5:02:32] AinzN: ijpHMM
[5:02:33] MathBastos: you were right, it did killed someone
[5:02:33] Boonia: looks like the breathe attack doesnt reset it
[5:02:37] Arkblade: the breath attack cut the stacks in half
[5:02:37] Darkaros: Did it go from 19 to 10 to 13? I'm second-guessing myself lol
[5:02:48] m3rcer: nope its just bugged
[5:02:55] Trample11: If you lose again, maybe you could try to spec Illaoi for dispelling buffs on target
[5:02:56] Shoaron: is this a boss you gotta nuke asap?
[5:02:58] Darkaros: that one didn't reset it ddHuh
[5:03:03] m3rcer: maybe the DOTs are bugging it?

[5:03:25] Daikurou: ignite is probly messing with it
[5:03:31] 1TrueTyrant: It seems like either the breath is bugged or the ignire + breath causes it to bug
[5:03:44] Daikurou: I dont recall having this issue
[5:03:54] Alfeana: the tentacles are adding stack and keeping it refreshed
[5:03:57] Boldie117: I found people talking about the bug but no solutions.

[5:16:50] reminkly: serated or his lane ability
[5:16:53] Darkaros: looks like multiple ways to get stealth
[5:16:58] LostBrotherK: serrated slice and his first lane ability
[5:17:00] Darkaros: the other Instant ability also had 20%
[5:17:02] reminkly: he also has a talent to let him start stealthed @itmeJP
[5:17:10] cleansock42: one of your lane abilities will cleanse and stealth you
[5:17:13] reminkly: but that MIGHT be later
[5:17:17] cleansock42: other than that its a passive

[5:27:15] reminkly: pyke is about building up debuffs
[5:27:21] reminkly: all of his dots hit super hard
[5:28:18] 1TrueTyrant: The only issue I see with this comp is the lack of AoE
[5:28:49] kdakda: is that the full game ?
[5:28:54] Darkaros: yes
[5:28:56] Darkaros: !rk
[5:28:56] itmeBOT: Ruined King, made by the Battlechaser devs, was released November 16, 2021 on Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4/5, XBOX One, and Switch! JP is enjoying the game a lot and pleasantly surprised by its quality.
[5:30:01] kdakda: what do u think about the game ! is it good ?! and worth 2 play ?!
[5:30:28] Boldie117: Took me 41 hours to beat on hard. I loved it.
[5:31:18] tjkan: yea about 40 hours for me as well, for 29.99 i thought it was great - a little jank on some stuff but it was a very enjoyable playthrough
[5:31:50] 1TrueTyrant: Yeah
[5:31:54] cleansock42: yes just not sure if this game says
[5:31:59] kdakda: nice ill give it a try
[5:32:00] titanodin: i am :)
[5:32:41] kdakda: offline campin it is ?
[5:32:42] 1TrueTyrant: Hes a giant question mark, along with a few other champs like aspects and demons whose origins are unclear
[5:32:49] ファ労苦: pyke is being controlled? i always thought he was a kalista-esque character

[5:34:49] 1TrueTyrant: Oh thats right there are Watchers in the lore, I wonder if theyr inspired from Marvel
[5:34:55] Boldie117: Have you had a chance to try the rythm game JP?
[5:35:14] The_Enygma: I still haven't gotten my girl ahri yet PunOko

[5:36:47] SouthernBiscuits: diddnt one of the skills say it kills the target after 3 turns?
[5:37:12] watts121: This is like the best MF has ever looked.

[5:38:20] Shoaron: I like pool party MF cuz she makes it rain coconuts LUL
[5:38:26] Darkaros: JP was asking people in chat about it too ワフルデラ ; did you get billed for it like someone in chat did?

[5:44:38] ファ労苦: only mf is i think
[5:44:42] ファ労苦: cuz shes a captain
[5:44:52] BroqRox: at this point LoL is only missing an mmo
[5:45:02] MagisterGir: @BroqRox which they're making
[5:45:03] Cartmanbruuuh: @BroqRox its in development
[5:45:07] BroqRox: ffs
[5:45:13] reminkly: they're also making an ARPG
[5:45:17] watts121: Illaoi is like Pyke's proud mom in this game
[5:45:19] Cartmanbruuuh: and a fighting game
[5:45:38] BroqRox: saw that the fighting game is like marvelVScapcom
[5:45:43] BroqRox: which looks fun
[5:45:53] reminkly: yep 2v2 tag/assist
[5:46:02] reminkly: it's very Marvel 2 I think
[5:46:05] Nogardknight: I wouldn't mind an immersive sim in the vein of dishonored or deus ex set in Runeterra, either
[5:46:40] watts121: honestly I kinda wish the devs were a little braver and made this the default difficulty. Have the story mode for journalists and Heroic be just the default "you wanna play a real rpg?" difficulty.
[5:46:56] Hevnlyst: not 2, closes to infinite
[5:47:00] Hevnlyst: closer*
[5:47:09] reminkly: ah yea, I guess it has a lot of Infinite mechanics
[5:47:17] BroqRox: lol
[5:47:22] 1TrueTyrant: @Nogardknight Have you seen the Unbound Thresh cinematic? Imagine a thief or Dishonored like game in that setting on Noxius, trying to steal from the likes of swain, Darius, etc.
[5:47:28] watts121: less a dig, more journalists gotta be able to beat the game fast to review it
[5:47:41] Cartmanbruuuh: bill
[5:47:43] Hevnlyst: lots of people who loved mvci are working on it too, so it makes sense
[5:48:17] AinzN: ijpKEK
[5:48:50] reminkly: @Hevnlyst I think a lot of folks are hoping it can be what MvCI was hoped/promised to be
[5:48:52] watts121: Pyke an edgy boi
[5:49:08] Hevnlyst: @Hevnlyst yea 100%
[5:49:27] 1TrueTyrant: @Hevnlyst Oh really? Thats cool, did MvCI flopp or something? Im not up to date with fgc news
[5:49:42] reminkly: it had a lot of rush at the end of its dev I think and some features never made it out
[5:49:50] Hevnlyst: yea mvci was a disaster commercially
[5:49:52] reminkly: or were fully realized, at least
[5:50:21] Hevnlyst: look up mvci collectors edition for a good laugh
[5:50:23] watts121: we talking about Project L? Rising Thunder was good, so I think this will be good.
[5:50:27] reminkly: yea
[5:50:30] reminkly: Rising Thunder was a ton of fun
[5:50:32] 1TrueTyrant: Ohh I see, then those devs are gonna love the fact this game is ognna be a live service instead of B2P

[5:50:40] lost_monke: did you get Pyke dagger from buhru temple ?
[5:51:02] yumadarr: I've just had 3 random crashes in this area jp, don't forget to save often
[5:51:08] watts121: lol Pyke so into it
[5:51:33] reminkly: I never had any crashes in my play through so I guess I was lucky
[5:51:42] lost_monke: having one save makes me feel uncomfortable
[5:51:45] lost_monke: LUL
[5:51:59] 1TrueTyrant: Live service gives you a lot more leeway time wise for devs to realise what they have planned
[5:52:00] Cartmanbruuuh: the dude is dead, let him be edgy
[5:52:05] watts121: @lord1doom thankfully reloads in this game resets the room
[5:52:17] Nogardknight: my game crashes every time I close it for some reason, but I don't lose any progress
[5:52:23] reminkly: this game does what, 2 autosaves right
[5:52:27] 1TrueTyrant: But not many companies can do Live Service without Riots resources
[5:52:30] AnorienNightwish: ijpONO
[5:52:35] DeadlyBrother: its over
[5:52:39] reminkly: @1TrueTyrant Tencent money does that
[5:52:40] aethybryr: Karma, do your thing
[5:52:49] Nogardknight: did somehow get stuck in terrain, but just reloaded my last save and fixed it
[5:53:00] WDForty: LUL
[5:53:04] Sprekenzee: you've never had a save at an impossibly impassible moment in the game and just ruined all your progress
[5:53:09] itzmebob13: my friend glitched the game by doing sidequests which made a mainstory char leave. and he only had 1 save
[5:53:12] aethybryr: LUL
[5:53:13] zerohour_88: Karma's in this game too? Kappa
[5:53:16] watts121: After playing this game...I have a feeling that the LoL MMO will have a Limit Break system like FFXIV for their "ultimates".
[5:53:42] Ayenea: that'll suck if htey do. cuz i don't care for the limit break system either
[5:54:05] lost_monke: sadly league mmo gonna be a thing at best 2025
[5:54:55] 1TrueTyrant: @1TrueTyrant Indeed, in fact I was reading a twitter thread of a writer of another animated show called the dragon prince that was lamenting having to cut away a lot of little things of their show due to budget/time concerns and couldnt put out a product on the same level as Arcane

[6:04:35] ghostsofcarcosa: Alright I'm still in but will set up ground rules
[6:04:40] lost_monke: I would go just for the experience
[6:04:41] Darkaros: Your crewmates are fellow random Twitch chatters who answered yes to JP's question
[6:04:54] ghostsofcarcosa: That means i could possibly get @AinzN
[6:04:57] ghostsofcarcosa: I'm in

[6:05:44] Shoaron: jeez
[6:05:44] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa which half of the moon do you want?
[6:06:00] vunter84: I would go only if I could film the first "Erotic Moon Scene"
[6:06:15] Shoaron: AinzN what we talkin bout here Hmm
[6:06:31] AinzN: Shoaron oh it's if we went to the moon
[6:06:47] AinzN: Like do we get to claim a part of it and that
[6:06:50] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN Hmm I say we take shifts on either side of the moon.
[6:07:16] ShrowdArrow: itmeJP

[6:07:29] FriendCat: @itmeJP out of 10 how is this game? thinking of buying it
[6:07:31] Daikurou: Mr beast
[6:07:34] SouthernBiscuits: you. by pure accident
[6:07:40] watts121: A V-Tuber
[6:07:40] SouthernBiscuits: oops this isnt my plane
[6:07:45] AinzN: The only thing I see bad about going to the moon is I would get killed for making the "I can see my house from here" joke like 50 thousand times
[6:07:48] samael_40k: depends on who we want to get rid of most Kappa
[6:07:55] FriendCat: ooo yes it looks awesome
[6:08:17] ghostsofcarcosa: It's okay someone could just retort "we can see everyone's houses" as an anti joke
[6:08:39] Nogardknight: yeah, the game is a rock solid experience and the price is right at $30 USD as well
[6:08:53] ghostsofcarcosa: welcome majorduck
[6:08:56] vunter84: would you go JP?
[6:09:00] ワフルデラ: how about a "I know where you live *points at earth*" joke?
[6:09:31] Boldie117: I would be frightened to death of takeoff.
[6:09:31] AinzN: Out of all the planets which one would you prefer to go to?
[6:09:54] Boldie117: Uranus YEP
[6:09:58] vunter84: I think I would be most nervous about the first 30seconds of takeoff. I think statistically most shit happens during rocket take off
[6:10:02] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[6:10:03] Darkaros: Man chose a gas giant as where he'd touch down first

[6:11:10] Boldie117: I recently just upgraded from a 970 to a 2080.
[6:11:37] Zcrazyscotsman: (doesn't remember time being different in interstellar) but time being different around a black hole though...
[6:11:53] Bearsquatch: nah they old
[6:11:54] ワフルデラ: I'd eat anything planetsize
[6:11:57] Bungeyes: all day
[6:11:59] Boldie117: The moon is sacred, I would not eat it.
[6:11:59] Kealsad: but the moon is already made of cheese
[6:12:01] Exodyne: Hot dogs no, cheese yes
[6:12:02] Darkaros: Hmm I feel like that's unsanitary
[6:12:04] BuffaloTheory: Is the outer layer a bun? Or is it just the dog?
[6:12:07] ZeusLong52: I'd eat it
[6:12:17] ワフルデラ: dude, Cohh would eat the moon if it was a hotdog
[6:12:19] ワフルデラ: 100%
[6:12:28] MorrighanDK: there is only 1 moon and its got holes in it, wack
[6:12:33] Exodyne: zekeCOHHDOG
[6:12:33] Nogardknight: what if the moon was fish?
[6:12:36] vunter84: If you were a hotdog would eat yourself, I know I would. I would be delicious.
[6:12:42] Cartmanbruuuh: If it was made of parmigiano probably
[6:12:59] Boldie117: Have you been keeping up with Cohh's reaction to SB?
[6:13:57] Boldie117: Wait, can I mention other streamers? I guess that coould be rude. My bad.

[6:32:14] TDotTerror: Jade Empire-esque Asia.
[6:32:15] RlDennis: It's like spiritual east asia no?
[6:32:25] 1TrueTyrant: basically china, korea and japan all in one
[6:32:41] lost_monke: there is level 16 dagger for Pyke in buhru temple
[6:33:11] Boldie117: For the horde!
[6:33:30] stankattack: stripHmm I want this game, but not for -$30.
[6:33:32] lost_monke: yes that door
[6:33:41] hauntedsoldier: wheres mordekaiser
[6:34:23] Boldie117: There is a really good shop you can unlock at bildgewater with a side quest.
[6:35:24] KARISMA: is the only available on like the lol store? cause i dont have a riot acct
[6:35:29] Darkaros: @stankattack just buy Battlechasers: Night War and pretend it has LoL characters then stripFufu

[6:35:36] Darkaros: !rk

[6:35:52] KARISMA: ^^noice itmebot rocks
[6:36:01] tropicana1802: Feel free to correct me if im wrong, but this looks like a LoL reskin of Battle Chasers?
[6:36:05] yumadarr: if you finish this area and don't miss anything, pyke will be happy with you and you with him
[6:36:12] Darkaros: Same devs
[6:36:25] simaryex: @C0LDS0LDIER exactly what it is and a buggymess to, + lacking of autosave
[6:36:30] kibriel: it looks like that because thats exactly what it is
[6:36:37] Mrhappy1227: this has autosave
[6:36:39] La_Fourmi: it's passif aggressif
[6:36:40] Mrhappy1227: it holds two autosaves at once
[6:36:41] La_Fourmi: LUL
[6:36:45] Ruuno: battlechasers was a great game. thats not a bad thing. devs use their strengths
[6:37:06] random_access_memory_: @Ruuno  wait is this the same devs? It feels very similar
[6:37:08] Daikurou: are you implying indie developers sticking to their guns when big companies ask to make a game?
[6:37:18] Darkaros: It could be like Darkest Dungeon 2, where people are mad that it's *not* a reskin PepeLaugh
[6:37:18] Ruuno: @AtomicToasstY  yes, its a licensed deal
[6:37:21] random_access_memory_: nice
[6:37:40] zerohour_88: or the dude in Indiana Jones LUL
[6:37:46] Mrhappy1227: Now for them to do a Darksiders style game as Kayn 👀
[6:38:04] tropicana1802: Yeah i liked battlechasers, this just looks c/p gameplay is all
[6:38:17] WDForty: coxWiggle are powerful
[6:38:35] cuetreepie: Oh I didnt know there was waves of combat in this game
[6:39:11] zerohour_88: @C0LDS0LDIER using a different IP and making it appeal to a bigger market, as I see it
[6:39:36] MagisterGir: @Imaacutiepie yup, if you pull more than one enemy while traelling it'll put you into a wave battle. It's pretty nice to do that rather than initiate combat repeatedly.
[6:40:00] cuetreepie: Yeah thats a really smart way of dealing with it

[6:49:45] Mill0u: serrated dirk is so op in this game
[6:49:47] Manooz: @komakinox it's an excellent game, buggy, but great
[6:49:48] komakinox: and with new lore (for me, i have never played LOL)
[6:50:28] Shenseiken: Only bugs I've noticed were the ones just fought. *shudder*
[6:50:37] komakinox: is there F5 saving in this one?
[6:50:49] Darkaros: There's auto saving, but not quick saving
[6:50:57] Cartmanbruuuh: KEKW
[6:50:58] Igneous_Ghost: This area of the game was terribly bugged a few days ago on the switch version.
[6:51:01] 1TrueTyrant: I think the most powerful beings are either aspects, demons, ascended and celestial beings. The rest are just very powerfull creatures.
[6:51:13] Igneous_Ghost: They've been releasing patches to fix the bugs though

[6:53:24] reminkly: i'm pretty sure that would 1 tap pyke
[6:53:27] TDotTerror: Worms are kinda bugs.

[7:01:14] TDotTerror: You got some good hits in, tho.
[7:01:15] lost_monke: you can beat it but you need to sequence your skills in a speciric manner
[7:01:55] Daikurou: the saves are coded weird. you can save having completely explored a zone. reload and it puts you at the entrance
[7:02:38] Kuronia: I died to this robot and reloaded, put my entire team in this place, but couldn't get out..
