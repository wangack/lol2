[2:31:21] Darkaros: There's a few factors for fewer rezes jokes aside. You can only rez Squadmates unless you're a medic, and there (at least used to be) a bug where you can't rez bodies that clip into objects
[2:31:22] RhodesToRome: he's insane POGGIES

[2:32:24] Riluske: I keep running into a glitch where I can't res people, even if they are a teammate or I'm a medic
[2:32:25] 7daysmakeitrain: @stalker2400 because the maps are gigantic ofcourse
[2:32:29] ワフルデラ: that bug where it doesn't show you're a friendly is still a thing
[2:32:36] Yetik: Let me win ijpNEVILLE

[3:11:59] slade3g: thank god lol
[3:12:26] afreak10: ahri can ?
[3:12:28] Darkaros: maybe you have to backtrack?
[3:12:45] Omakie: ahri can see them
[3:12:51] AnorienNightwish: ijpHI JP and chat
[3:12:54] slade3g: guess not? maybe you have to explore everything
[3:13:32] Devlind: @AnorienNightwish ijpHI
[3:13:34] slade3g: u thinking Ahri as healer?
[3:13:43] CRO_4: i run Pyke with lots on invis so he isnt targeted Ahri with evasion items and healer spec and Yasuo with buffed up shields. no tank run is kind of fun
[3:14:12] DezartIII: Ahri is a great healer, but not because she heals a lot (which she does) but cuz she can dps and heal
[3:14:19] Darkaros: Anorien ijpHI
[3:14:37] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: How many playable characters are there? I havent had a chance to tune in much
[3:14:38] 1TrueTyrant: I personally dont like the dot on ahri
[3:14:39] Boonia: pyke damage seems low
[3:14:51] 1TrueTyrant: I prefer the straight dmg + healing build
[3:15:01] DezartIII: I feel like dot pyke is the way
[3:15:17] DezartIII: But it requires a lot of runes
[3:15:19] Kevst0r: i didnt figure out how to build pyke so i stayed with yasuo just twoshotting everything
[3:15:27] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: Ah I see
[3:15:41] DezartIII: NODDERS
[3:15:41] slade3g: i like crit yasuo a lot
[3:15:48] DezartIII: Same
[3:16:19] CRO_4: if you can get stealth and his plunder buff up a lot pyke seems to do more damage than yasuo imo
[3:16:39] slade3g: damage ahri doenst rly use her passive
[3:16:49] slade3g: just fox fire and dots i think
[3:16:59] slade3g: essence shift
[3:17:01] spideycsa: I use her as damage
[3:17:10] slade3g: or thief even
[3:17:32] slade3g: but im no expert, just thiking outloud
[3:17:38] Kevst0r: @slade3g build ahri so you get a full passive at the start of battle and just spam devour^^
[3:18:03] slade3g: thats a cool build, i did dot/aoe ahri
[3:18:11] slade3g: its cool that there are alot of options
[3:18:13] Argo257: @itmeJP bring all the girls to the yard :P
[3:18:37] Argo257: pyke and yasuo are more single target dps
[3:18:40] spideycsa: does dot damage
[3:18:44] Argo257: fortune is aoe dps
[3:18:45] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[3:18:59] DezartIII: Yasuo can support ahri pretty well with his party crit buff
[3:19:03] slade3g: pyke is more single target damage
[3:19:04] TehMud: So my grandma called for Thanksgiving.... I do NOT know how but she got started on politics.... aren't holidays fun?
[3:19:07] Argo257: and ahri gets aoeish later too
[3:19:28] Jukettaja: Is Ahri the same level as everyone else?
[3:19:37] Kevst0r: i always think full singletarget is better cause u can focus one out immediately and reduce the dmg u take
[3:19:37] slade3g: yes
[3:19:48] slade3g: @Jukettaja they all gain xp
[3:20:06] Argo257: i used the single target champiojns for boss fights
[3:20:08] TehMud: Every holiday grandma and grandpa on my mom's side somehow get started
[3:20:18] TehMud: On Dad's side grandpa doesn't give a shit
[3:20:21] Argo257: but i mostly run with illaoi  fortune and ahri
[3:20:36] AinzN: ijpONO
[3:20:36] WhiteMilk89: ijpD
[3:20:37] ファ労苦: oof
[3:20:40] slade3g: yikes
[3:20:44] AnorienNightwish: ijpONO
[3:20:46] 1TrueTyrant: oof thats rough
[3:20:49] grayzxadvent: D:
[3:20:55] 0ldnslow: That is probably cause all they do is sit around and watch News.
[3:21:00] mornstar0: That was common back in that time period.
[3:21:03] TehMud: Grandpa just cooks the food... and he is AMAZING at it. Yet he STILL won't reveal his secret recipe for Smoked Ribs
[3:21:23] Darkaros: Yay woopsCheer
[3:21:41] AinzN: TehMud maybe he's left it to you in his will?
[3:21:46] AshLike: @TehMud  coz she knows you will come around here and tell us the recipes as well LUL
[3:21:54] 1TrueTyrant: Maybe dot is better
[3:22:01] 1TrueTyrant: monkaW
[3:22:13] Jukettaja: Who's the badass with a beard?
[3:22:15] Argo257: ahri is so strong because her 2nd ult is also a team heal
[3:22:57] Argo257: and she has the most mana of them all
[3:23:13] TehMud: @AinzN Maybe. Lord knows he won't give it to my dad. Not for any bad reason he loves my dad but lets just say when it comes to the grill my dad makes more charcoal than food.
[3:23:24] kibriel: old man slapaxe has more health than your whole party
[3:24:09] slade3g: u can check
[3:24:15] Omakie: 5th one over
[3:24:21] slade3g: u can check what u upgraded
[3:24:24] samael_40k: i find that taking out the weaker enemies 1st helps alot.
[3:24:45] AinzN: TehMud I mean that just makes sense
[3:24:48] slade3g: i dont know the button on controller, but keyboard its B
[3:25:03] Jukettaja: Then it must be B on the controller too.
[3:25:08] Jukettaja: It only makes sense.
[3:25:11] Argo257: ahri starts weak but gets stronger later in the game
[3:25:14] slade3g: lel
[3:25:21] 1TrueTyrant: LUL
[3:25:36] Kevst0r: @Argo257 i rly hated it that u have to use her for this part..but after that i never swapped her out haha
[3:25:36] Big_Headed_Gamer: gachiGASM
[3:25:40] slade3g: some nice fanservice
[3:26:00] Argo257: @Kevst0r i had an all girls group xD
[3:26:04] Omakie: her ult is way better if you have all the stacks
[3:26:15] Argo257: @itmeJP she starts weak when you first get her it takes a bit
[3:26:28] Boldie117: If you get the rune on her basic ability it gives you a 20% chance to get another turn. Pretty good proc.
[3:26:28] Ken_Taru: Anyone know of a good 4k 120 monitor on sale tomorrow?
[3:26:35] Kevst0r: @Argo257 finished it with yasuo, illaoi and ahri..illaoi with like 12k hp, yasuo critting for 40k on some skills
[3:26:58] Argo257: @Kevst0r yasuo was my boss killer champ xD
[3:27:08] samael_40k: braum/illaoi/pyke is my team
[3:27:32] Argo257: i never really used braum tbh he felt so weak imo
[3:27:32] samael_40k: illaoi is healer/damage for me
[3:27:56] samael_40k: braum is pretty much a meatshield that hands out shields
[3:28:03] samael_40k: for me
[3:28:05] Pur3Adrenaline: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3
[3:28:07] Argo257: illaoi is the best all rounder good tank good heals and decent dmg
[3:28:20] Kevst0r: @Argo257 100% crit are just dumb^^
[3:28:50] slade3g: Spoders monkaS
[3:28:51] TehMud: Jebasted
[3:29:07] TehMud: Jeabaited Jebasted
[3:29:13] TehMud: Jebaited Jebasted
[3:29:39] Argo257: @itmeJP i would recommened miss fortune for aoe fights she can bomb pretty good
[3:29:43] Boldie117: I like that Ahri dps'
[3:29:46] Boldie117: to heal
[3:29:55] WDForty: smaller numbers but more consistant ticks maybe?
[3:30:23] Kevst0r: ahris heal can get pretty strong
[3:30:29] TehMud: Alright chat anyone making anything fancy for dinner today?
[3:30:34] Lord_Spiral: @Argo257 on the hardest difficulty, aoe isn't very efficient
[3:31:17] Argo257: @Lord_Spiral i only played on the 2nd highest and on that difficulty she recked them pretty good
[3:31:52] Argo257: don't know how hard the jump to the highest diff is
[3:31:54] Lord_Spiral: on the hardest, the enemies have too much health/ you don't deal enough damage to make splittingthe focus worth it
[3:32:11] slade3g: @Argo257 the gap is pretty high
[3:32:20] spideycsa: dificulty will get easier with gear
[3:32:27] Lord_Spiral: the best strategy is to focus on an enemy
[3:32:35] Kevst0r: yeah
[3:33:10] Lord_Spiral: yeah, Iimagine by endgame, like most rpgs, gear will help you overcome stuff but early- midgame, focus firing and single target damage is the safe bet
[3:33:45] spideycsa: I have been using yasuo ahri and illoai
[3:34:16] Kevst0r: i liked the scaling, difficuly to start but at the  end when u get all runes and skills and work with enchantments it is easier but still a small challegne some times
[3:34:38] Cal_197: hey JP what would you rate this game so far
[3:34:38] m3rcer: but with MF u have an all girl team rooAww
[3:34:40] slade3g: the worms are annoying
[3:35:37] GT_JamesATL: Can you swap out party members in combat?
[3:35:54] ranin: this must be towards the end of the game judging by how many abilities he has and hp
[3:35:57] Nogardknight: I started stacking haste on her
[3:36:46] Tronix_604: is this on ps5?
[3:36:50] yumadarr: i found when I got ahri I just mostly used her Instant and the heal on hit ability that was it
[3:36:52] slade3g: was there no dropped frames this week?
[3:36:55] Darkaros: yes Tronix_604
[3:37:04] Tronix_604: nice, thx

[3:45:38] Omakie: ahri is all about stacking up her orb as fast as possible
[3:45:40] spideycsa: I can do massive damage with her
[3:45:42] JimB0b0: Charm seems good
[3:45:47] spideycsa: with devour
[3:45:49] ch0senpotato: stick with her, she gets really good
[3:45:58] DezartIII: She also hits constantly and has a chance of getting extra turns
[3:46:09] DezartIII: Fox fire is a lot of dps
[3:46:18] betaviewer1: Ahri always sucks early game. Kappa
[3:46:24] ch0senpotato: the red teeth ability is amazing
[3:47:02] DezartIII: You want to use the orb more imo
[3:47:14] spideycsa: her 1st instant can hit 3 times and have extra turns
[3:47:22] DezartIII: ^
[3:47:32] DezartIII: He needs to unlock the third talent ability tho
[3:47:50] yumadarr: but it gains 3 stacks to build up a free heal
[3:48:00] spideycsa: build up for devour
[3:48:04] Nogardknight: Orb of Deception is not good until 3rd tier talents, tbh

[3:48:21] texmech: Chat what is the price of this game?

[3:49:12] DezartIII: ^^
[3:49:38] DezartIII: I get a bit frustrated cuz Ahri gets the spotlight every time LUL

[4:09:08] DD_The_Shmey: @itmeJP If only you knew someone who had a spare xbox controller
[4:09:10] ChokingVictimSMT: almost as stupid as buying a $200 controller Kappa

[4:09:43] haueryoutwitch: @itmeJP I have the same remote and my bumpers broke off after using it for a year. I picked up a tool kit but its never been the same
[4:09:43] ChokingVictimSMT: ps5 have drift yea
[4:10:03] texmech: I have one and had the same issue. I lost the nub. Not that big of an issue
[4:10:05] Tronix_604: ps5 drifts, it's clunky and battery life is garbage

[4:14:17] AinzN: itmejpDANCE itmejpDANCE itmejpDANCE
[4:14:20] Big_Headed_Gamer: she's pretty much that tanky in the moba
[4:14:40] doomdrake13: 70% no? 40 + 20 +10 +5 per tantacle but only when you have both Taunt and Tentacle Barrier online is what I read.
[4:14:58] Darkaros: Math on stream PepoChamp
[4:15:06] Big_Headed_Gamer: NotLikeThis
[4:15:21] doomdrake13: Ahhh OK the extra 10% are only for Physical damage.
[4:15:28] m3rcer: plus 10% for physa
[4:15:32] DezartIII: The thing about taunt lasting one less turn, is that you'll renew it every turn, and that will make your tentacles strike twice. That alone gives her just so much passiv healing Kreygasm
[4:16:13] Big_Headed_Gamer: needs more furry tails

[4:18:51] Big_Headed_Gamer: monkaSHAKE
[4:19:03] Darkaros: ya they released a patch with the end of the ranked season Sovekz

[4:19:15] titanodin: also teleport portals
[4:19:29] titanodin: axiom arc is OP
[4:19:50] 1TrueTyrant: Sounds about right, pre season stats and ranked get reset when the season starts so people dont really care about trying
[4:19:53] Tronix_604: hey does that new bullet keystone buff jhins first shot yo make it as good as his 4th?
[4:20:23] titanodin: mf likes axiom arc too
[4:20:37] Sharodin: thats what adc's say every single season^^
[4:20:52] Tronix_604: I did an eclipse collector axiom mf build yesterday LUL
[4:21:22] 1TrueTyrant: Yeah its true sadly, adc has dropped hard in the last 4 seasons or so
[4:21:26] doomdrake13: LUL
[4:21:28] avgrojm: I like new archangel
[4:21:31] Big_Headed_Gamer: well they've made it pretty clear that as long as they have a big scene in the competitive work for league. adc's will never be a get hype pop off kinda role

[4:22:56] Tronix_604: axiom yi is another dirty one LUL
[4:23:02] AinzN: Shadow imps bad?
[4:23:09] Respawned__: how is the variety of zeugles in this game? do you often fight things that look the same?
[4:23:24] avgrojm: ress is the new mid/adc champ, arch angel heals and increases ability hast based on max mana making it is it spam abilities for many mages
[4:23:40] ch0senpotato: there we go!

[4:27:20] DezartIII: Yes
[4:27:22] DezartIII: And using orb
[4:27:26] ch0senpotato: yeah her mana regen is important
[4:27:43] ch0senpotato: you could have used her 2nd ult there to heal everyone back to full

[4:29:45] AinzN: ijpEZ Clap
[4:30:08] Igneous_Ghost: basically no.
[4:30:14] PrinceofTheUniverse: do other part members level when not in battle?
[4:30:15] Igneous_Ghost: not for a while iirc
[4:30:26] svensonidis: @PrinceofTheUniverse yeah
[4:30:28] Igneous_Ghost: other members do level out of party
[4:30:28] PrinceofTheUniverse: cool
[4:30:42] ファ労苦: no league of legends is pretty much just a dream match
[4:30:50] Big_Headed_Gamer: PepeLaugh
[4:30:55] Igneous_Ghost: your XP gets split amongst your entire party so now it's split... 6 ways?
[4:31:01] ReginaldXIV: Maybe it's purgatory after the void swallows everything Hmm
[4:31:05] Tronix_604: I just looked it up, the next champ after vex is an add, but it got delayed so we'll be getting a new adc and then a support shortly after that are paired (like rakkan and the adc bird chick LUL) in early 2022
[4:31:13] Tronix_604: adc*
[4:31:51] ReginaldXIV: Didn't they say 2 characters are coming from Arcane?
[4:31:56] ReginaldXIV: Or did I dream that
[4:32:08] titanodin: @ReginaldXIV you dreaming
[4:32:55] ReginaldXIV: Oh Sadge
[4:33:24] Tronix_604: dunno bout that, but ya vex was late on release and then they spent a month nerfing her, so the adc release was delayed till early 2022
[4:33:28] ファ労苦: ahri with the spirit bomb though
[4:33:43] ch0senpotato: how do you speed up combat with a controller?
[4:33:44] Tronix_604: but now they can release the matching support shortly after also

[4:34:51] ch0senpotato: you can press RB during an ulti cutscene to avoid waiting so long
[4:34:59] ch0senpotato: it speeds up combat and cutscenes
[4:35:20] Jukettaja: The combat does seem faster now
[4:35:28] Igneous_Ghost: Switch does have some pretty bad load time a few gnarly bugs that they're working on.
[4:35:33] Tronix_604: that sucks about the switch,  I would have considered getting it on there to play while at work
[4:35:50] Jukettaja: I don't know if that's just because JP is more familiar with the flow of the game
[4:36:24] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Tronix_604 by the time we get a next gen powered switch this league game will have a 5 part series Kappa
[4:36:26] thesestrangenotions: @Tronix_604 that was the main reason I was looking into the steam deck, optimization issues pop up here and there for NSW

[4:44:03] Big_Headed_Gamer: the only darkest dungeon reference i got was eating meals PepeLaugh
[4:44:06] Jukettaja: Thinking about it, League would be the perfect Darkest Dungeon setting. Everyone always loses their sanity and starts insulting their team mates.
[4:44:12] CaptainFalkyn: it's good when you have more crit chance for bonus essence theft stacks
[4:44:13] zucroh: any reason he is not using mf guys ?

[4:45:21] Darkaros: Mrshilka ijpH
[4:45:31] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Jukettaja there is one league character that had a dark story so maybe they can do a 1 character game like that like they are doing with heimer, ekko, and nunu
[4:45:33] Mrshilka: Ahri gives the beest hus too

[4:45:45] Mrshilka: so good it will feel like the last hug you ever had NODDERS
[4:46:02] Jukettaja: I was thinking more on the lines of a MOBA manager where the players have sanity bars like in Darkest Dungeon.
[4:46:16] Jukettaja: Losing team fights would cause them to start flaming team mates.
[4:46:24] Big_Headed_Gamer: so like tft
[4:46:28] Jukettaja: Gaining objectives would boos sanity.
[4:46:33] Jukettaja: Boost even.

[5:21:44] 1TrueTyrant: @ThePointGaming I would even argue having a dedicated in-house music studio for game companies is a must in this day and age

[5:23:52] ThePointGaming: its funny..that i feel graphics have reached like a point that they can't really get much better, and now music is becoming SUCH a big deal again
[5:23:58] AinzN: JP makes sure she brings enough for chat
[5:24:06] 1TrueTyrant: @Nogardknight No lies were said

[5:24:38] Nogardknight: I liked it because it made me realize that open world games could be fun again after the umpteenth ubisoft open world, but it had it's fair share of issues

[5:28:56] Sprynx007: UI definetly better than BChasers
[5:29:10] 1TrueTyrant: Maybe for the black marks?
[5:29:16] spideycsa: Fishing will let you buy books that give you runes
[5:29:17] afreak10: and Viego sword
[5:29:25] RlDennis: @ThePointGaming It's relatively simple, skills that cost mana can be cast faster for less damage, normal speed for normal damage and slower speed for high power.
[5:29:26] aznhai: Fishing is better later on when you unlock the open-seas fishing holes. You get items with enchants you can't get otherwise
[5:29:31] XanianEmpire: @ainzn I have an eye on that 100k so I will save haha

[5:35:43] 1TrueTyrant: Thresh is my favourite villain in the game followed by the void and then the demons and some aspects
[5:35:54] TehMud: AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
[5:36:04] AinzN: Such a good song!
[5:36:26] RlDennis: I wanna see the Mage Rebellion or the creation of the Darkin animated like arcane rooCry
[5:36:56] LegendsOfBobby: i want the void. some me velly tenticools
[5:37:18] godmaxking33: how far is he into the game?
[5:37:21] LegendsOfBobby: or shurima since im an xer main
[5:37:30] RlDennis: Darkin are somewhat related to the void because they were shuriman ascended that fought the void. So you'd see that, likely
[5:37:42] RlDennis: And maybe even the fall of shurima since it's related
[5:37:53] Igneous_Ghost: @godmaxking33 around 50%ish of the main story I think

[5:39:30] ch0senpotato: i mean, to an extent
[5:39:47] Kaddhy_2k10: @RlDennis i felt like playing zed or an assassin like Qiyana in the body of Camille, with the mechanic in his kit.
[5:39:48] Igneous_Ghost: have you claimed the runes from your lore progress yet? you might have a few already
[5:39:49] ch0senpotato: think it refunds a spell cost if you kill something with it

[5:42:27] RlDennis: We need an animated series on how Zed became Nocturne rooSip and just make that canon LUL
[5:42:31] SoulSlicer808: happy Thanksgiving jp
[5:43:09] eod_soldier: can't wait for MCU Crew on monday
[5:43:09] ghostsofcarcosa: @SoulSlicer808 happy thanksgiving
[5:43:50] steve87r: what is the name of the one with tails?
[5:43:56] LegendsOfBobby: i mean the easiest explaination is he messed up a shadowstep and got stuck...doesnt make for a good story
[5:44:01] Igneous_Ghost: Ahri
[5:44:05] steve87r: thanks
[5:44:14] 1TrueTyrant: LMAO
[5:44:27] eod_soldier: its cat girl 1 Kappa
[5:44:49] AinzN: eod_soldier actually she's a fox ijpSIP
[5:45:05] perseay797: 5k more hp to go :)
[5:45:07] RlDennis: @LegendsOfBobby back in the day people theorized that Nocturne could be zed because when he killed Shen's father, the one that cried out was Zed. And the shadow arts being forbidden and all
[5:45:25] eod_soldier: ehh same thing a half ass furry lol
[5:45:46] RlDennis: Shadow essentially taking over Zed in the future, but not sure if they ever decided to change the story of zed. That was from years ago
[5:45:53] Sprynx007: wipe bois
[5:45:53] AinzN: eod_soldier how dare! ijpD
[5:45:56] Igneous_Ghost: I thought Nocturne was the one who gives Zed and the other shadow ninjas their powers.
[5:46:08] eod_soldier: I DARE five0Reee
[5:46:19] afreak10: F
[5:46:30] ch0senpotato: well you did just save the game
[5:46:36] RlDennis: Also possible. Most of the time people were just pointing out the similarities between them, like Zed E and Nocturne passive
[5:47:22] RlDennis: But it's likely just coincidental, but it could make for a cool story if they decide to spin it in such a way that Nocturne is the origin of the shadow power I guess
[5:47:31] AinzN: peepoGiggles
[5:47:43] Kaddhy_2k10: @RlDennis And i gone with Evenshroud, that buffs teamfights
[5:48:01] RlDennis: Yeah, I did that on Sejuani yesterday
[5:48:10] RlDennis: Glacial, evenshroud and abyssal
[5:48:20] Sprynx007: Arent there equipment that negates whatever this mob is inflicting? 🤔
[5:48:45] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[5:48:48] Igneous_Ghost: I don't think so...
[5:49:10] Valask: Valask subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 8 month streak! One day Dota will make use of its IP in a good and interesting way, just you wait COPIUM

[5:49:50] AinzN: COPIUM
[5:50:05] Igneous_Ghost: idk if battlechasers had it, but this game has quite a few ways to cleanse such debuffs with your abilities
[5:50:19] steve87r: chat, is marvels ultimate alliance 3 any good?
[5:50:21] steve87r: its on sale
[5:50:50] RlDennis: Don't think I've ever actually played a marvel game other than .. rooThink a spiderman game that was on Playstation 2?
[5:50:51] SlipCrit: its fun but its giot low fps its some places
[5:50:54] spideycsa: its fun with friends
[5:50:56] RlDennis: I don't remember which
[5:50:58] steve87r: hmm, ok
[5:51:08] Valask: Also I looked away for one second and it seems everyone is playing FFXIV now? What the hell happened?
[5:51:18] ghostsofcarcosa: its ok better with friends etc
[5:51:18] Valask: I stopped keeping up with games for a while
[5:51:21] LegendsOfBobby: xpack in a week?>
[5:51:26] chalando: I ate too much peepoHappy
[5:51:27] BuffaloTheory: @SlipCrit So like every Switch game then LUL
[5:51:28] SlipCrit: @Valask the new expac releases in likje 8 days
[5:51:31] Igneous_Ghost: Yeah Endwalker comes out soon.
[5:51:32] AinzN: Valask people realised its the best game ever
[5:51:58] Igneous_Ghost: Also it's just been getting more and more popular with more people abandoning WoW
[5:52:23] Igneous_Ghost: kinda curious what WoW's numbers are like with all the news that keeps coming out about activision.
[5:52:24] SlipCrit: wows dying and 14 is thriving NODDERS
[5:52:24] Valask: what did wow do? I thought Shadowlands was popular
[5:52:28] Valask: at least at release
[5:52:35] SlipCrit: blizzarhappened
[5:52:39] SlipCrit: blizzard*
[5:52:49] konvay: monkaS
[5:52:51] prfella: @valask boy have u missed a lot
[5:52:55] Sovekz: Started playing ff14 like a week ago, I am 52 and feel like I have no idea about anything in the game
[5:52:56] Igneous_Ghost: Blizzard and Activision has revealed to have had an INCREDIBLY toxic work culture over the past several years
[5:53:03] Valask: I have actually, lots of work T-T
[5:53:05] Sprynx007: Blizzard did. KEKW
[5:53:08] Big_Headed_Gamer: PepeLaugh
[5:53:21] SlipCrit: KEKW
[5:53:22] Big_Headed_Gamer: PepeLaugh don't tell him
[5:53:22] thanh_n2004: i remember
[5:53:24] ch0senpotato: idk what happened with blizzard
[5:53:32] HereForPizza: ijpNODDERS
[5:53:35] ch0senpotato: did they release another expansion
[5:53:39] LegendsOfBobby: if i dont care about the story. FF14 have good game play loops and mechanics?
[5:53:41] Valask: wait what'd they do
[5:53:53] prfella: @ch0senpotato neither does blizzard Kappa
[5:53:55] AinzN: Valask if you really want updates on everythingcheck out JPNN! ijpJPNN
[5:53:56] RlDennis: Someone didn't warn me that buying the game wouuld lock me out of the trial so I'm not even sure where I'm at in the story of ARR rooCry
[5:53:58] Hyluhnduh: did anyone even stop playing wow?
[5:53:59] SlipCrit: @LegendsOfBobby absolutely althoguh the story is the main draw
[5:54:02] Valask: WutFace
[5:54:05] dudwasup: Some crazy shit happened on a private plane
[5:54:06] 1TrueTyrant: @Valask Bad things, lots of bad things which got exposed
[5:54:07] BuffaloTheory: @LegendsOfBobby Yes, but the story is probably the biggest draw for the game
[5:54:10] ch0senpotato: ohhh that thing to do with activision?
[5:54:15] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[5:54:16] prfella: the got sued..a lot
[5:54:16] ch0senpotato: i had heard of that actually
[5:54:30] prfella: they,*
[5:54:31] aznhai: Only 500? that's great - bobby, maybe
[5:54:32] RlDennis: I had a pretty busy month when I bought it and I just never re-upped the subscription rooFeels
[5:54:33] ch0senpotato: forgot activision = blizzard
[5:54:34] Neragsito: also, the game is shit now
[5:54:35] Valask: yea I was aware of Bobby being in trouble
[5:54:36] LegendsOfBobby: can i at least "skip" story stuff?
[5:54:45] Valask: what in god's name
[5:54:52] Hookan91: Hyluhnduh I'm sure there are people who did, but I would guess the majority of WoW players don't care and will keep playing no matter what
[5:55:08] Darkaros: Bobby threatened to kill an employee in a voice mail ijpKEK
[5:55:09] BuffaloTheory: @LegendsOfBobby You can buy a story skip up to the end of the last expansion, sure. For real money.
[5:55:18] DagooX: also an employee committed suicide over the sexual harrasment
[5:55:24] Neragsito: not kill the assistant, have her killed
[5:55:26] Valask: good god
[5:55:27] RlDennis: I've played WoW just a little bit, but I'm more the type of person to play everything once for the experience and then I burn out relatively quickly
[5:55:35] 1TrueTyrant: @Valask Including threats of murder from managment to former eployees and forged emails as well as the co-ceo quitting after one month there so yeah
[5:55:38] Igneous_Ghost: The president of blizzard had to step down and then was replaced with a pair of people... one of whom quit fairly shortly after getting the position because she did not get paid the same amount as her male co-lead... in the wake of several allegations of a toxic work culture against women
[5:55:38] Valask: this doesn't sound real wtf
[5:55:46] AnorienNightwish: it also took blizzard SEVEN months to get out 9.1 patch
[5:55:51] RlDennis: But good luck trying to get a mentally stable raid group to experience content for the first time when you don't have much to show for rooKek
[5:55:52] AnorienNightwish: for wow
[5:56:04] Igneous_Ghost: We've been finding out new BS every week for MONTHS.
[5:56:10] prfella: @valask told ya, u missed a lot LUK
[5:56:14] ch0senpotato: ahri instakills goblins
[5:56:17] Igneous_Ghost: I think the original lawsuit was made public around... august?
[5:56:17] ch0senpotato: from a distance
[5:56:21] 1TrueTyrant: @Valask sorry I meant AGAINST former employees not from oops
[5:56:29] Igneous_Ghost: and we found out about Acti's CEO's death threats like a week ago
[5:56:38] TheNicOfTime: !next

[5:56:45] SarudaBaruda: i figured everyone would be in a turkey coma by now
[5:56:46] Hundisilm: Better yet - how does she defy gravity and just fly through the air
[5:56:55] Igneous_Ghost: magic
[5:56:55] Valask: this sounds like mafia shit wtf
[5:56:56] RlDennis: Magic
[5:57:08] Valask: also the music is great holy shit Kreygasm
[5:57:08] RlDennis: I mean, to be fair. That's basically what it is LUL
[5:57:28] prfella: not that far off Valask
[5:57:42] ch0senpotato: you haven't even discovered using devour with 0 mana cost yet :D
[5:57:48] Valask: @SarudaBaruda I brought up politics once and they stopped inviting me 4Head
[5:57:48] LegendsOfBobby: when i mean skip. and i stuck in cut scenes and convos that really dont help me do quest
[5:58:03] prfella: there was also an employee walkout
[5:58:09] RlDennis: regrettably happens more often than you'd assume rooFeels
[5:58:19] Neragsito: severel walkouts
[5:58:20] Igneous_Ghost: @ch0senpotato Devour with 0 mana cost, and constant refresh of her essence stacks even
[5:58:29] Nogardknight: extra turns are pretty ijpPOGGERS
[5:58:43] 1TrueTyrant: @Valask If intended thats a 5Head move
[5:58:57] RlDennis: Oh and if you've been gone for a while, JP definitely isn't addicted to League and Riot definitely didn't release a quality show on netflix Kappa
[5:59:25] Valask: I'm aware of the League show, primarily because of how much better it is than Dota's
[5:59:29] AinzN: ijpKEK
[5:59:32] Secchuu: is reddit down?
[5:59:42] Igneous_Ghost: omg I forgot there was a Dota Show...
[5:59:42] Oddbunny: cohhLUL
[5:59:52] ch0senpotato: it is a braum shield but not the best in the game
[5:59:53] Valask: so did everyone involved
[5:59:57] AnorienNightwish: @Secchuu not for me
[5:59:59] Valask: they got a character from into dota
[6:00:01] BuffaloTheory: @LegendsOfBobby Yes and no. It's a very heavily story-focused game, but you can skip individual cutscenes and ignore side quests entirely (for the most part). Or you can buy the story skip off the store and just skip all the story up to Shadowbringers (or Endwalker at release, most likely) entirely.
[6:00:05] Valask: most people didn't know
[6:00:12] Valask: who she was
[6:00:19] Secchuu: @Secchuu ok Sadge
[6:00:30] steve87r: all time, too far
[6:00:34] Secchuu: @AnorienNightwish ok Sadge
[6:00:34] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[6:00:40] Hundisilm: mm, it is very good - I think the Viking show might be better though
[6:00:49] AinzN: Legend of Korra ijpSIP
[6:00:51] Valask: Are we counting anime as well
[6:00:58] prfella: @hundisilm he said animated
[6:01:06] 1TrueTyrant: @AinzN You capping
[6:01:08] Nogardknight: last airbender MAYBE, but korra?  ehhhhh
[6:01:10] Valask: if so I'd say Fate Zero
[6:01:11] Hundisilm: yes the animated viking show
[6:01:15] Suhnkecher: avatar
[6:01:15] vdopantera: one punch man :D
[6:01:17] prfella: oh
[6:01:17] ch0senpotato: game of thrones Kappa
[6:01:17] steve87r: original cowboy beebop
[6:01:18] Hundisilm: with the vikings and such
[6:01:19] BuffaloTheory: @Hundisilm Vinland Saga?
[6:01:28] Hundisilm: yes Vinland
[6:01:29] 1TrueTyrant: ATLA I could see the argument but Legend of Korra? not even close
[6:01:30] Igneous_Ghost: Saying Korra instead of ATLA LUL
[6:01:31] Darkaros: D:
[6:01:32] WDForty: D:
[6:01:32] RlDennis: I do really like Fate Zero
[6:01:34] AnorienNightwish: @Secchuu accessing it from Eu, if that makes any difference.. might just have a bad node between you location and the reddit server you are trying to access
[6:01:35] HereForPizza: D:
[6:01:44] Valask: oh no
[6:01:45] Ageisfang: D: damn jp savage today
[6:01:52] WhiteMilk89: ijpD

[6:02:32] Valask: I'm doing a PhD T-T
[6:02:39] Valask: it's fucking destroying me
[6:02:44] ghostsofcarcosa: Bojack is great if your into getting really down and questioning shit while having some laughs
[6:02:47] Valask: live in the library
[6:02:50] Igneous_Ghost: I generally don't trust any live-action adaptation of any anime on netflix.  Can't remember one that was any good.
[6:02:56] 1TrueTyrant: @Valask That shits so rough, it makes sense now
[6:03:06] AinzN: Valask hope all that pays off for you bud! ijpH
[6:03:07] WeeMr_Goodcat: Bova is quite good, no?
[6:03:12] RlDennis: Valask was gone for a few months, now imagine someone waking up from a few year long coma. It'd be so weird
[6:03:26] BuffaloTheory: @Igneous_Ghost The Bleach film actually wasn't as bad as it could've been
[6:03:27] prfella: valassked just logged onto the internet for the first time in 2021 Kappa
[6:03:32] ch0senpotato: what's updog?
[6:03:32] Igneous_Ghost: Oh, that PhD is gonna be super woth though Valask

[6:03:48] Hundisilm: to compare them

[6:07:11] ghostsofcarcosa: @santabomb5 Same to you!
[6:07:13] Valask: I've been trying this new routine suggested by an older PhD student that also works part time, basically "only check the internet three times a day and delete twitch ffs"
[6:07:14] spideycsa: most definately @Hookan91
[6:07:14] RlDennis: @itmeJP You think this game will end up in your top 10 for game of the year?
[6:07:18] ch0senpotato: yeah i never figured this statue out
[6:07:21] Hookan91: spideycsa zekeSMRT

[6:09:15] ghostsofcarcosa: @AnorienNightwish Don't spoil it for everyone we wanna remix 2020
[6:09:20] Hundisilm: I think there were a couple of things that could be improved
[6:09:29] Valask: can I use Twitch Pog
[6:09:34] SlipCrit: 2020 HD remaster anneS
[6:09:49] Valask: @SlipCrit nopenopenopenope
[6:09:52] ghostsofcarcosa: 2020 in 8K resolution coming at you
[6:09:55] AinzN: Valask I think there are a handful of characters to play and you can use any of them that you wish but there will be times where you need to use a certain one
[6:09:59] 1TrueTyrant: What could possibly go wrong LUL
[6:10:10] ch0senpotato: this is boring dialogue, they're just unlocking a door...
[6:10:16] AinzN: I'm going to buy so many lotto tickets for 2020!
[6:10:21] Valask: Twitch Warwick Nautilus Pog
[6:10:30] Hundisilm: Is the writing for this game good?
[6:10:37] AinzN: Hundisilm yeah it's not bad
[6:10:40] santabomb5: Doors deserve exposition too
[6:10:41] DagooX: coxWiggle
[6:10:46] SlipCrit: shadowy coxWiggle
[6:10:47] Valask: so far there's a ton of proper nouns, made up words
[6:10:54] AinzN: Valask I don't think they are in the game
[6:11:00] Lazyrebels: Squid4
[6:11:00] Valask: FUCK
[6:11:05] Valask: shit
[6:11:10] RlDennis: roo7 Valask
[6:11:11] AinzN: So far JP has only got 6 chracters
[6:11:24] 1TrueTyrant: @AinzN You know if I went back in time, the best way to make money would be knowing lotery numbers and the stock market
[6:11:39] RlDennis: I'd assume these are the only characters you get, could definitely be wrong though.
[6:11:41] AinzN: 1TrueTyrant I would buy so much Game stock!
[6:11:55] Valask: well thanks for the chat everyone, I ought to get back to work before I lose track of time
[6:11:59] 1TrueTyrant: @AinzN for sureee
[6:12:01] Valask: game looks good and the music is lovely
[6:12:04] Darkaros: Goodbye forever Valask

[6:12:11] Valask: PepeHands
[6:12:18] ch0senpotato: green orb next to the tendrils
[6:12:22] Ageisfang: GL PHDing Valask
[6:12:28] 1TrueTyrant: @Valask Btw did you see the Project L update? the Riot fighting game? It looks pretty good
[6:12:35] ch0senpotato: oh.
[6:12:39] ghostsofcarcosa: Later Valask see you when your a doctor maybe
[6:12:42] ch0senpotato: uhh
[6:12:44] ch0senpotato: nvm then XD
[6:12:52] RlDennis: rooThink
[6:12:54] Darkaros: Next time we see Valask they'll be a wizened doctor, nothing but skin and bones and ramen PepeHands
[6:13:09] kongr1994: thats for after you get rid of the mist
[6:13:11] aznhai: It's unlocked later @itmeJP after some story stuff
[6:13:14] ghostsofcarcosa: It's true Darkaros but they will have gained the ultimate power KNOWLEDGE

[6:13:58] Sprynx007: dark tentacle
[6:14:05] Sprynx007: Kreygasm
[6:14:10] santabomb5: Damn good call

[6:14:17] Darkaros: Huh. Didn't see that coming.
[6:14:37] Ageisfang: good lord so much hp
[6:14:42] W_Tile: D:
[6:14:46] santabomb5: is 11k a lot?
[6:14:53] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa I mean they could double up on their PhD and become a super doctor
[6:14:55] Igneous_Ghost: at this level it is
[6:15:06] AinzN: santabomb5 I think that's the most an enemy has had so far
[6:15:16] santabomb5: well then
[6:15:25] ファ労苦: yeah easily

[6:16:24] pilater_: do you think i can enjoy the game without knowing anything about League?
[6:16:32] AinzN: pilater_ yeah
[6:16:35] ch0senpotato: wow ok then
[6:16:37] Igneous_Ghost: Yeah, easily.
[6:16:39] RlDennis: Problaby
[6:16:42] AinzN: I know nothing of League and I think this game is good
[6:16:44] DagooX: brutal
[6:16:45] santabomb5: Illaoi noooooo
[6:16:59] ファ労苦: league lore is pretty overarching so you don't really need any background knowledge on most of it
[6:17:02] pilater_: ok nice it looks intresting
[6:17:06] Sprynx007: Just brute force the boss 5Head
[6:17:32] W_Tile: damn D:
[6:17:38] AinzN: Boss be like ijpFIGHT
[6:17:45] steve87r: you're already dead and dont know it
[6:17:46] TDotTerror: F to Ahri, jeez.
[6:17:48] santabomb5: What was that a hit for 389 and 334?
[6:17:57] Darkaros: Illaoi can't tank it monkaW
[6:17:57] ghostsofcarcosa: This boss came for overwhelming violence
[6:18:21] 1TrueTyrant: WTF
[6:18:21] Sprynx007: maybe time for defense buffs instead of pure offense? 🤔
[6:18:28] 1TrueTyrant: Shadow tentacles?
[6:18:29] Nogardknight: dead AF
[6:18:29] AnorienNightwish: wait does Ahri res herself?
[6:18:35] Hundisilm: At least we've got tails
[6:18:37] Igneous_Ghost: This game fills a gap between an older series of short stories, and the most recent lore event.  As someone who vaguely knew stuff about the area and the characters, and didn't read said short stories, I enjoyed it quite a bit.
[6:18:45] AinzN: AnorienNightwish I think he used a potion
[6:18:50] W_Tile: NotLikeThis
[6:19:09] 1TrueTyrant: this is fd up
[6:19:36] Maiven_Tahl: @itmeJP  Happy Thanksgiving!

[6:28:45] Fujugaming: oh damn
[6:28:50] Threebleez: delicious blurry food
[6:28:51] AinzN: What's the pie?
[6:28:58] TDotTerror: The music matches the wait of the focus, funny enough.
[6:29:06] ch0senpotato: is food tastier if it's blurry?
[6:29:54] 1TrueTyrant: Crit or atk pwr imo
[6:30:09] Ageisfang: yea the blur is basically just extra seasoning ch0senpotato
[6:30:28] ch0senpotato: cool i'll take my glasses off when eating in future
[6:30:56] Rennalt: i might be wrong about marisha ray, i thought i saw her name in a tweet about the voice cast but i can't find it now
[6:32:47] AinzN: That just seems annoying
[6:32:52] Gundevil: This is just obnoxious, and not a puzzle in any way
[6:33:47] AinzN: coxChicken

[6:34:46] BuffaloTheory: Turkey's great as long as it's not fuckin' dry
[6:35:01] Raging_PG: I made duck today, much better than turkey
[6:35:02] 1TrueTyrant: Turkey is an inferior bird
[6:35:13] aeonicVector: big thing is turkey is easy to screw up, and hard to get fantastic
[6:35:13] Veisrac: I prefer chozo
[6:35:17] Ken_Taru: cracker barrel has some good turkey. we do thanksgiving catered each year. so worth the time savings for 5 adults
[6:35:19] thesestrangenotions: I can only appreciate t day turkey if the plate is balanced
[6:35:33] yraelvaint: this is another bait where anyone who supports turkey gets banned ijpONO
[6:35:44] thesestrangenotions: decent cranberries and tater dish is key
