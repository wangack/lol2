[2:23:05] kibriel: sarah gettin none
[2:23:06] Hopsinka: why ahri never speak there
[2:23:09] Madracah: everyone hits on Braum
[2:23:13] Madracah: its BRAUM
[2:23:16] „ÉØ„Éï„É´„Éá„É©: I hope so
[2:23:22] ryukenchi: hell yeah
[2:23:23] TDotTerror: Braum's too pure for Sarah's feminine wiles.
[2:23:24] SouthernBiscuits: everyone wants the braum
[2:23:27] ColonoscoPete: Was that flirting?
[2:23:32] ryukenchi: braum too dumb to notice lol
[2:23:34] Miros__: if you're not hitting on Braum, what are you even doing with your life?
[2:23:39] DagooX: she likes the stache
[2:23:53] Darkaros: coxWiggle
[2:24:04] Walshmobile: +216 dmg
[2:24:04] ch0senpotato: Sarah was as confused about her actions there as the rest of us
[2:24:10] HereForPizza: coxWiggle furryRun
[2:24:15] ryukenchi: Illaoi also hit on braum remember. but he ahd to hit the restroom XD
[2:25:28] Madracah: OOOO how is Ahri ?
[2:25:34] MooseLounge: Unused runes
[2:25:58] TDotTerror: Damn, this game's tight. Wish I got enough to cop it.
[2:26:07] kibriel: shes got nine tails... what more you need to know?
[2:26:20] Lurkiestmonstr0: are there support classes in the game ?
[2:26:46] Darkaros: Yes, Braum and Illiao have support abilities
[2:26:57] Darkaros: Ahri also has heals
[2:27:27] knuxeh: is it max 3v3?
[2:27:42] Darkaros: 3v3 but the enemies can come in waves (like this one, see the top crystals)
[2:27:53] knuxeh: cool. thanks :)
[2:28:40] titanodin: could have saved for the second wave?
[2:28:45] Jotunspor: OOOO
[2:28:46] titanodin: oh nvm
[2:28:56] Darkaros: ijpHMM coulda sworn there were multiple waves there
[2:28:56] TDotTerror: Nothin' personnel, kid.
[2:29:19] titanodin: @Darkaros it must have been the second wavfe already
[2:29:27] titanodin: furryRun
[2:30:27] MooseLounge: Haven't seen the other streams much, does JP know about the rune rewards from lore collecting?
[2:30:33] Darkaros: Ya he does
[2:31:43] AinzN: ijpSAD
[2:31:46] HooverFan: got mine this morning... so far, nothing
[2:31:51] Tighron: booster shots are good
[2:31:52] XForce3: Oh when did JP switch to the hardest difficulty?
[2:31:55] Niskratus: Hi, just got here, Is this a League of Legends JRPG?
[2:32:02] BlueSapphyre: yes.
[2:32:21] Darkaros: XForce3 Uhhh like the 2nd stream? He did a bunch of sidequests after Grey Harbor (?) and felt pretty powerful
[2:32:29] Niskratus: thats cool
[2:32:33] Darkaros: !rk
[2:32:33] itmeBOT: Ruined King, made by the Battlechaser devs, was released November 16, 2021 on Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4/5, XBOX One, and Switch! JP is enjoying the game a lot and pleasantly surprised by its quality.
[2:32:37] GratuitousCatouflage: From the sounds of it Moderna seems to be the rougher of the batch when it comes to reactions, but it's worth it.
[2:33:09] XForce3: @Darkaros Ah gotcha thanks, yea I agree, you get some pretty powerful synergies that allow you to plow through enemies pretty easily
[2:33:16] Niskratus: how have i not heard of this? i was playing league earlier today, i think i have become oblivious to advertising, lol
[2:33:31] AinzN: I have mine booked for a few weeks away
[2:33:37] HooverFan: in and out quick at walgreens
[2:33:42] AinzN: Also got to book my flu jab
[2:33:46] kibriel: if you are playing league already, you are not their target audience
[2:33:46] Darkaros: Ya this game was practically only advertised in two Riot streams, pretty easy to miss
[2:33:47] optionunlimited12: are you playing with a controller
[2:33:54] misterg31: booster are only available to 70+ here
[2:33:55] Darkaros: yes he is
[2:34:01] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1464283980619038723
[2:34:30] XForce3: If you guys liked this game, Battlechasers on Steam is by same company and it's good too
[2:34:31] EndyBT: Stones are pretty painful tbh
[2:34:42] knuxeh: did he just take a picture of his monitor
[2:34:45] kibriel: booster seat? gotta be 4' or shorter
[2:34:49] Omsung: I worked at a clinic on campus and it was only 100 people or so, all of them elderly
[2:35:05] wude: i could go to cub right now and get my booster in my area
[2:35:39] Walshmobile: CVS typo?
[2:35:42] wude: Cub is a grocery store
[2:35:43] HooverFan: here in the US, it's open to everybody depending on when you got your original vaccine shots and which vaccine it was
[2:35:49] konvay: Cub is a grocery store in Minnesota (maybe neighboring states)
[2:36:26] Omsung: Is the top persons barrier only work with physical attacks?
[2:36:45] Omsung: huh
[2:36:46] Omsung: oh LOL
[2:36:57] ArgonFalcon: LUL
[2:37:12] XForce3: Illaoi's heals make this game a breeze
[2:37:18] Omsung: Yeah I've noticed, seems very good
[2:37:34] Darkaros: JP's Illaoi has a +10% def vs phys but has like a massive 70% vs everything, or something
[2:37:45] ch0senpotato: @itmeJP you can roughly double ahri's damage output by using devour as an execute on the middle enemy. If it kills them, with the right perks it damages all enemies and costs no mana

[2:40:31] Omsung: hes also voiced by Liam which is great
[2:40:40] kibriel: and we get illidan as narrator, for a bonus
[2:40:41] Omsung: pleasant surprise when I clicked on the stream
[2:41:22] Omsung: increased crit chance probably?
[2:42:19] Omsung: Im only guessing because stealth is usually associated with crit chance increase but idk
[2:42:52] Tcorrea95: Anime af
[2:42:53] Omsung: god DAMN
[2:43:01] LeoNoved: I havent played this game yet but in the Battle Chasers game Airship syndicate made i think it made you unable to be attacked by normal attacks?
[2:43:46] Lazyrebels: Thoughts on this game? Saw some reviews. And it left me confused.
[2:43:56] Darkaros: !rk
[2:43:56] itmeBOT: Ruined King, made by the Battlechaser devs, was released November 16, 2021 on Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4/5, XBOX One, and Switch! JP is enjoying the game a lot and pleasantly surprised by its quality.
[2:43:56] RhapsodyBD: I guess she's all about dem tentacles
[2:44:00] ch0senpotato: different abilities do different amounts of damage depending on items / runes i guess
[2:44:06] ch0senpotato: yasuo was weak for me
[2:44:16] ch0senpotato: pyke and braum were strong
[2:44:27] ch0senpotato: but your playthrough is completely different
[2:45:57] ch0senpotato: @LucasWigs spam
[2:46:27] Omsung: dang
[2:46:46] LeoNoved: ahh they use overcharge in this game as well eh?
[2:47:01] RhapsodyBD: Oh so you kept Akali (sp?) thought you were thinking on switching
[2:47:17] Omsung: nice

[2:47:57] HoochXVII: ahri and ms fortune were super OP for me, i think it depends who you put extra runes into
[2:47:59] Daikurou: ahri healing is super strong and she can debuff someone with every debuff
[2:48:25] ch0senpotato: ok i'll be honest i just simp for the foxgirl
[2:48:53] RhapsodyBD: Ah Ahri, for some reason thought her name was akali, shows how much I know of league now

[2:49:27] TDotTerror: It bleeds together, ngl.
[2:49:30] Omsung: This combat seems interesting enough to where I wouldnt want to increase the combat speed
[2:49:33] RhapsodyBD: @ch0senpotato who wouldn't
[2:49:42] ch0senpotato: well akali is an AP midlaner in league with dashes and her name begins with A so you're not far off
[2:49:48] ch0senpotato: @RhapsodyBD
[2:52:19] Omsung: that ability is just: PauseChamp
[2:55:01] Omsung: yeah its a bit long
[2:55:48] ch0senpotato: oh this puzzle is so ambiguous i hate it
[2:56:18] Darkaros: The crow caws at midnight üê¶
[2:56:21] 1TrueTyrant: Jebaited
[2:56:24] Wu1fman411: This game seems cool, think I'll wait for it to go on sale tho
[2:56:49] Omsung: DAMN
[2:58:01] MooseLounge: Boss mechanic?

[3:04:32] XForce3: His attack dispels you
[3:04:39] Wu1fman411: His attack has dispel
[3:04:42] Daikurou: I believe he cleanses you
[3:04:42] appaomega: and he gained them?
[3:04:43] ch0senpotato: it's in the description, he steals buffs
[3:04:47] Lurkiestmonstr0: That attack has a dispel on it
[3:04:57] XForce3: Press Y and you can inspect his stuff
[3:05:54] ch0senpotato: wtf where's the heal?
[3:06:11] ch0senpotato: he used the healing ulti but it didn't work
[3:06:35] Darkaros: Angler Trickster, the trick is that the game no longer works like you expect
[3:06:50] 1TrueTyrant: I think the whole buff stealing mechanic is bugging stuff out
[3:07:24] DagooX: later game, not tested enough greyCR
[3:07:30] ch0senpotato: congrats, you just beat a bug abuser lol
[3:09:20] AinzN: EZ Clap

[3:09:52] yumadarr: the clue is in the previous room
[3:09:52] aznhai: @itmeJP riddle on table down the stairs
[3:09:56] aznhai: tablet*
[3:09:57] XForce3: 2 stag, 3 owl bells
[3:09:58] ch0senpotato: idk
[3:10:19] XForce3: It was on the previous tablet, "stag won twice, then was beaten thrice" or something
[3:10:21] MooseLounge: Tablet on the floor
[3:10:22] aznhai: what xforce said
[3:10:53] yumadarr: you hit the wrong one last
[3:10:55] XForce3: You ran the stag berll on accident
[3:11:03] Wu1fman411: your rang stag on accident
[3:12:34] XForce3: Yes, when you do the extra puzzle on the other side you'll get more enchantments
[3:12:44] XForce3: From the thing at the front
[3:13:07] STEELSOUL69GAMING: loving watching this game is this free t play?
[3:13:16] Darkaros: $30
[3:13:17] ch0senpotato: @STEELSOUL69GAMING sadly no it's 30 dollars

[3:23:46] XForce3: JP doesn't like the free skins he got with the deluxe versoin?
[3:24:09] ch0senpotato: would love to hear a ZeroPunctuation review of this game: "cookie cutter, uninspired, generic characters, based on a moba which turns players into drug-induced zombies"
[3:24:41] ch0senpotato: he generally hates everything though
[3:25:57] STEELSOUL69GAMING: lol
[3:26:03] XForce3: Don't worry this puzzle looks way more complicated than it is

[3:31:57] XForce3: Nah you can get it at the end, you'll get a shortcut

[3:34:24] XForce3: There are so many bugs in this game
[3:34:34] XForce3: Randomly not being able to change target, can't move in menus, etc
[3:34:43] yraelvaint: That was definitely my primary complaint about it. Lot of things felt buggy.
[3:34:54] Darkaros: We're getting to the immersive spaghetti code part of the game, for the LoL fans
[3:35:12] ch0senpotato: and not being able to open boxes when an NPC is standing within 2 metres
[3:35:28] Klorkin9: No, those are innsmouth not bugs
[3:35:35] zucroh: i just finished this game in 31h but had a lot more sidequests and legendary items to find if i wanted,good game tho
[3:36:04] LeoNoved: you were asking about why didnt that kill the enemy with 300 health  I think it was a single target attack?
[3:36:23] Miros__: does this game feel as grindy as it looks? Seems to have a very thin gameplay loop..
[3:36:51] ch0senpotato: hmm. Doesn't feel incredibly grindy but it doesn't have much replay value imo
[3:37:05] Darkaros: From what I've watched the game doesn't feel grindy. But i have a higher tolerance for grindy cuz "do every fight in a linear path" ain't bad in a JRPG, vs actual grinding LUL
[3:37:12] LeoNoved: Maybe it just missed the other two targets? I dont know
[3:37:35] XForce3: Never forget Wriggle's Lantern, so OP
[3:37:43] zucroh: it's similar to jrpgs, if you are not used to the "entering combat/exiting combat"  can look/feel grindy and repetitive
[3:37:47] Jukettaja: Whenever I saw multiple enemies in one area I expected you to have to Pokemon fight your way through each fight but I like how they combine the enemies into a multiwave fight instead
[3:38:15] 1TrueTyrant: Dayum you crazy like that JP
[3:38:22] Darkaros: Ya, Pokemon is the definition of a grindy RPG game IMO. Also random encounter RPGs in general
[3:38:23] NarzBarz: NarzBarz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! Eyy
[3:38:23] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing NarzBarz! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:38:38] Jukettaja: @1TrueTyrant The man's a menace
[3:38:49] XForce3: Yea you can definitely dodge encounters at least, so its less annoying
[3:38:53] ch0senpotato: WoW is the epitome of a grindy game
[3:39:04] 1TrueTyrant: @1TrueTyrant Would you say hes nutty? LUL
[3:39:08] XForce3: But lack of fast travel in a lot of places can slow it down
[3:39:13] Darkaros: ppOverheat FLAP
[3:39:17] HereForPizza: ppOverheat
[3:39:25] SanityAssassin15: ppOverheat
[3:39:32] awgwab: JP would you ever consider redoing the souls fandom show after elden ring comes out? Lost of new souls in the last 5 years
[3:39:34] Jukettaja: The combat speed is so fast
[3:39:57] jussanotherquishafan: Dont u Flipping Flap Back ._.
[3:39:59] Jukettaja: What's a fandom?
[3:40:07] Darkaros: !fandom
[3:40:13] ch0senpotato: @Jukettaja like a furry convention
[3:40:17] Jukettaja: That answered that @Darkaros
[3:40:31] Darkaros: A show so old I deleted the command ijp7 It was like a focused talk show about a franchise, like we had one for FF
[3:40:49] Jukettaja: So like the Marvel show?
[3:41:02] iskavan1: @Darkaros so like mcu crew? :o
[3:41:03] titanodin: we dont have a command but we do have furryRun
[3:41:06] RhapsodyBD: ugh need to get those flexible ar phone holder to watch streams in bed lol
[3:41:18] XForce3: The graveyard of JP's shows is getting larger and larger..
[3:41:20] Darkaros: Ya. But not news-focused like MCUCrew is. MCUCrew is if the Marvel Fandom show went multiple episodes
[3:41:29] RhapsodyBD: holding with hand not comfortable
[3:41:35] DagooX: monkaEyes furryRun
[3:42:01] Altair900: COPIUM some day theyll come back
[3:42:08] XForce3: Hey, I've been with you since SOTG, those were my college days
[3:42:11] 1TrueTyrant: furryRun ?
[3:42:19] vegetius: is the game so good its full price worth or wait for a slight discount seems to be solid to me so far
[3:42:22] Darkaros: furryRun Chase your dreams of shows coming back
[3:42:25] ch0senpotato: what are those essence orbs that rnaomdly float at you?
[3:42:26] thesestrangenotions: fandom shows got carried off by furryRun
[3:42:29] DagooX: why do you have an emote from TheStockGuy? furryRun PepeLaugh
[3:42:34] NejyCR: its worth imo
[3:42:39] vegetius: ty
[3:42:48] twitchingDoe: LUL
[3:43:08] RhapsodyBD: d
[3:43:30] RhapsodyBD: eh which game doesn't have bugs
[3:43:30] iskavan1: not battlefield 2042 lvl of bugs thou
[3:43:47] XForce3: Anything proc on hit is good for Ahri
[3:43:58] XForce3: Especially when you get that upgrade where her orb hits 3x
[3:44:03] 1TrueTyrant: Wasnt there another epic item?
[3:44:08] 1TrueTyrant: In that loot
[3:44:40] Darkaros: Eh. That bugged boss fight with stacking buffs is pretty bad LUL Might be more gameplay-affecting than any BF2042 bug
[3:45:35] ch0senpotato: do the most important upgrades first or you'll run out of the gem things before you do them all
[3:46:06] 1TrueTyrant: BOOBA ?
[3:46:23] clackalacka: booba
[3:46:36] „Éï„Ç°Âä¥Ëã¶: no
[3:46:37] ch0senpotato: not really

[4:28:11] afreak10: KEKLEO
[4:28:12] yraelvaint: The % completion got pretty wonky for me.
[4:28:12] ch0senpotato: nah it specifically stays on 66% for an age
[4:28:24] Boonia: @itmejp how much does this game make u want to play Yas in league? I kinida wanna play him the more i play this game
[4:28:31] thesestrangenotions: I thought that cox emote was a walrus with a shit eating grin....

[4:28:43] ch0senpotato: main story
[4:28:55] afreak10: COPIUM
[4:28:55] yraelvaint: ijpKEK
[4:29:01] Jukettaja: It actually is pretty short
[4:29:30] Wu1fman411: Its gonna be like that meme "The boss when he's the enemy vs. when he's a playable character" but for Thresh
[4:30:02] DagooX: casual 14k hp
[4:30:22] Hundisilm: there's a meme for that?
[4:31:09] Hundisilm: where - where is the truth - I cannot find it
[4:31:34] ch0senpotato: @itmeJP the terror debuff hangs around between battles and i don't think you can cleanse it
[4:31:48] DagooX: monkaEyes
[4:31:53] LostBrotherK: you can cleanse it, else it'd be way more damaging
[4:33:05] LeoNoved: oh no that debuff mechanic again?
[4:33:22] Jukettaja: Makes sense
[4:33:30] DagooX: Jebaited

[4:35:43] Jukettaja: Did you watch the Yasuo cinematics?
[4:36:35] L0uk___: 30
[4:38:36] yumadarr: xp is based on enemy level compared to yours, and every level now stays 1000 to level up so it stays relatively the same time to level each time
[4:39:31] ch0senpotato: oooooh it was cleansed! i was wrong
[4:40:04] LostBrotherK: if you have multiple debuffs cleansing chooses randomly
[4:40:43] dunnajd: Miss fortune is broken AF
[4:42:26] yumadarr: yeah lots of options to synergize multiple people as well

[4:44:16] Papapwnage: @itmeJP Imagine Blizzard wouldve used the WoW IP to make so many games like this as Riot is doing
[4:44:47] ch0senpotato: hearthstone?
[4:45:03] Jukettaja: They had Warcraft 3
[4:45:07] stellar_sorcerer: Blizzard has Heartstone, WoW, Starcraft, Warcraft, Overwatch...
[4:45:08] ch0senpotato: WoW itself was the warcraft IP
[4:45:23] HereForPizza: there was also the warcraft movie
[4:45:25] ArgonFalcon: They did warcraft  into WOW. Heroes of the strom, Hearthstone
[4:45:49] Wu1fman411: Big True
[4:46:09] Wu1fman411: Double Big True
[4:46:15] ShooterZee: wow is now generic like lotr
[4:46:20] ch0senpotato: i want more lore to do with lamb and wolf
[4:46:20] Papapwnage: Think that perspective might be based off IGN knowledge. People that read the books love it
[4:46:22] Heracy: Warcraft lore was over for me when we killed Arthas
[4:46:32] theflood: League gets to move backwards from a giant list of characters.  Building a world/story to explain them.   WoW sort of locked themselves into a world.
[4:46:37] ShooterZee: genre changing
[4:46:42] „Éï„Ç°Âä¥Ëã¶: wow had a way better outlet for lore (mmo)
[4:46:58] Rasheth: Rasheth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 98 months! howdy JP
[4:46:58] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Rasheth! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[4:47:01] Flyspeck42: lotr is "boring" because everything copied it
[4:47:04] „Éï„Ç°Âä¥Ëã¶: while league lore is pretty much nonexistent unless you were willing to actually read stories
[4:47:15] Wu1fman411: Can you call Lotr generic when it invented the genre
[4:47:29] Darkaros: Also League rewrote its lore, you can't forget that. Again, look up Ahri's old lore for a laugh
[4:47:44] „Éï„Ç°Âä¥Ëã¶: wow rewrote a lot of its lore too
[4:47:56] „Éï„Ç°Âä¥Ëã¶: there was a lot of retcons from what i remember
[4:47:56] ArgonFalcon: League always had lore, but they've retconned it at least twice
[4:48:02] theflood: yup, LoL is retcon city.   They didn't start with story based gaming, so it's sorta... whatever they want to do.
[4:48:07] RlDennis: Nidalee lore rooVV
[4:48:40] ch0senpotato: it's good that they didn't let lore constrain them at the beginning
[4:49:01] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1464283980619038723
[4:49:55] ch0senpotato: it's only generic because it was so popular it became the baseline for medieval fantasy
[4:49:57] Sovekz: No, you can't call it generic, generic are the things that copied it so JP is completely wrong here
[4:49:59] WeeMr_Goodcat: I can call JP PJ??
[4:49:59] thanh_n2004: i think the problem is assigning a negative connotation with the word generic
[4:50:09] thanh_n2004: who did that anyway?
[4:50:28] ch0senpotato: in its day it wasn't generic
[4:50:29] theflood: ditch the word generic and go with "vanilla" to appease all? haha it's vanilla fantasy? something like that maybe? haha
[4:50:36] „Éï„Ç°Âä¥Ëã¶: yeah things can still be good even if theyre generic
[4:50:57] Altair900: Negative connotation to vanilla is an opinion too
[4:50:59] ch0senpotato: JRR Tolkien invented several languages just for his worldbuilding
[4:51:06] theflood: vanilla is delicious! lol
[4:51:10] Wu1fman411: How about "Intrinsic"?
[4:51:45] L0uk___: damage to all on kill is op op
[4:51:55] L0uk___: feels so good
[4:52:04] ch0senpotato: damage all on kill++
[4:52:48] Mrshilka: peepoArrive G'day @itmeJP and chat ijpH
[4:52:50] yumadarr: I find ahri has so much overcharge mana isn't that great
[4:53:04] m3rcer: Pog
[4:53:44] GratuitousCatouflage: I have my doubts WoT will translate to a sustained show. The strength of the books is their sheer volume and the amount of characters that are introduced/explored. There's a limit to the amount of concurrent characters you can juggle in film.
[4:54:34] ch0senpotato: and it can be upgraded twice
[4:54:40] ch0senpotato: umcommon -> rare -> epic
[4:54:57] Mrshilka: Jp's tweet about ep 4 has got me interested in going back and watching more eps
[4:55:07] stellar_sorcerer: I'd rather watch a series about Mistborn tbh
[4:55:36] GratuitousCatouflage: I need to keep watching definitely.
[4:55:45] Papapwnage: Arcane gets so much better in A2-A3
[4:55:58] Mrshilka: talking about WoT
[4:56:00] Cixah: episode 4 of WoT was very good. Theyre short cutting some stuff from the books, but its done in a way that makes sense and I'm ok with it
[4:56:04] Mrshilka: Arcane was great all way though
[4:56:13] Papapwnage: what is WoT?
[4:56:18] Mrshilka: Wheel of Time
[4:56:19] Cixah: Wheel of Time on Amazon
[4:56:20] JamestheDaemon: wheel of time
[4:56:20] CaptMidlifeCrisis: to be fair the books have about 2200 characters, so the show is still going to have tons of characters
[4:56:21] NinjaPandaEU: Critics say the later ones are even better, and Brandon Sanderson said one of episode in Season 1 is a 10/10 in his opinion.
[4:56:32] Mrshilka: Robert Jordons books made into a series by Amazon
[4:56:53] NinjaPandaEU: It's not. Definitely.
[4:57:06] Mrshilka: @CaptMidlifeCrisis gonna give alot of people a high end show on there resumes lol
[4:57:16] Bornstellar_Makes: only gets better @itmeJP
[4:57:18] br00zr: must be nice
[4:57:22] HoochXVII: panda secrets rooVV

[4:57:29] estebanstrangiato: cool
[4:57:30] Deadlyasskicker: D:
[4:57:37] estebanstrangiato: does he like tamales?
[4:57:41] br00zr: I still talk to Robert Jordan. No big.
[4:57:43] Bearsquatch: just awoke from a leftovers fueled food coma
[4:57:51] NinjaPandaEU: Nah, I just read his threads on Reddit.
[4:57:54] Droigan: I just read all the books again before the show. I noped out after the first episode, but it gets better then?
[4:58:04] NinjaPandaEU: He talks about the show and his input on it a lot.
[4:58:10] Mrshilka: @Droigan same ep 2 stoppe dme but Jp said ep 4 is a banger
[4:58:15] Halothane_: The books were a slow start (imo) too, but they got better over time.
[4:58:32] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour.

[4:58:52] Wu1fman411: Someone said 30 earlier
[4:58:56] Mrshilka: oh 30 cool cool
[4:59:23] Droigan: First books were fantastic in WoT, the first episode made me  think the showrunners hadn't even read them.
[4:59:33] Mrshilka: @Droigan this
[4:59:47] Mrshilka: First books had you chopming at the bit for the next ones
[4:59:48] Bearsquatch: how many hours have you sank into this so far?

[5:03:42] NinjaPandaEU: Okay I found it, Sanderson says the script is a 10 (my bad), and it's not Ep 4, but I won't spoil which one. He's active on Reddit and comments on the show a lot.

[5:04:28] Mrshilka: be good to see then @NinjaPandaEU
[5:04:31] NinjaPandaEU: @Mrshilka I knew I read his comment on it, just had to find it again.
[5:04:51] Mrshilka: I want the WoT series to be so good, as witht he LoTR series and maybe even Mass Effect
[5:04:52] NinjaPandaEU: We be doin' a lil bit of stalking sometimes.
[5:04:58] LostBrotherK: they do weak dmg but hit 6 times for 6 terrors, 20 stacks of terror cuts hp by 80%
[5:05:01] stellar_sorcerer: ninja did some espionage
[5:05:08] Mrshilka: they do the thing NODDERS

[5:08:10] Mrshilka: indeed sorry should said that at start
[5:08:31] Mrshilka: since I know so little LoL Lore
[5:08:35] Droigan: Huh, noticed in my notifications that I got a gifted sub to a channel I've never been to. Didn't know that was a thing. Not from someone I know either. Does gift subs just draw from the pool of all twitch users if say 100 subs are given to a channel with less viewers?
[5:08:55] ch0senpotato: there's 5 lore pages in this area, pretty interesting reading if you subscribe to the theory it's thresh before he turned bad
[5:08:59] Mrshilka: @Droigan I think so unless check who gifted it to you might been a friend
[5:09:28] Droigan: @mrshilka No, don't know the person who did it.
[5:09:36] Mrshilka: this might be a reason
[5:09:39] Bearsquatch: thats why Kappa
[5:09:44] Mrshilka: deth NODDERS
[5:09:55] br00zr: I have received a couple when offline too I guess from gift bombs
[5:10:09] Mrshilka: @br00zr could be
[5:10:23] Mrshilka: I thinkt he artwork was Iilu and Zook
[5:10:37] Darkaros: Random gift sub bombs are an unknown algorithm. Offline followers can get gift subs over active followers in chat, many people get gift subs to people they've never heard of (again over active chatters) etc

[5:17:01] Darkaros: @Sheal88 according to a Spreadsheet I'm looking at, you have ~200 quests, 7 days left, so you have to do that many quests a day AYAYA

[6:56:46] Bearsquatch: thresh lines. making me want to play LOL again
[6:57:04] MagisterGir: @Jukettaja turn order is stat based on haste I think in the beginning. Afterward turn order is effected by the speed and recovery of abilities.
[6:57:45] spideycsa: sweet you built up your ultis now, should make the fight easier
[6:58:33] MagisterGir: Ahri's ultimate 2/3 feels so weird to watch
