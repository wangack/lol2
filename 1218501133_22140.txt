[6:22:52] Sonicdoughnut: just all gas no brakes
[6:23:18] disnean: Thats just so exciting. Just speculations
[6:23:44] Reisswind: diverting the trolley to save one group of people at the cost of another

[6:26:17] valedecem11: I mean 86
[6:26:24] jeaily: Not only that, the beginning is reminiscence of when we flee from rhalgr reach and we might have to do the same for thavnair.
[6:27:02] Bregan92: Thavnair is port with access to Garlemald maybe that will be the plot
[6:27:15] x_raisoren: if zenos sides with us endwalker will be the worst expansion
[6:27:18] Riluske: Last minute Zenos turns good
[6:27:19] JessePfau: @itmeJP someone on the subreddit mentioned how the alchemical symbol for Platinum (the color of the expansion) is the symbols for Sun (us) and Moon (Zodiark?) put together, possibly some foreshadowing there
[6:27:21] Debuggingfool: xenos is a lame character that I was bummed they brought back
[6:27:25] TheWorstTimelime: Zenos is our best friend :)
[6:27:28] Munetani_NJimha: Zenos is the Golbez of FFXIV

[6:29:52] KrazeArcain: behmut 2 this time for real
[6:29:55] Reisswind: Ascians represent eternal life, Zenos/Fandaniel represent death, we are ephemeral inbetween. Final boss is a physical manifestation of that existential spectrum
[6:30:02] Darkaros: The man behind the man stripCult
[6:30:07] jatii: We sorta had that with Thordan in HW for a bit

[6:31:03] MrMoogleberry: ijpF1 ijpF3

[6:32:28] Schmubbs: Is it possible that Fandaniel was responsible for bringing about the final days in the ascians' time? Through some other entity, that is
[6:32:30] Renaise: You merge with Hydaelyn, Zenos merges with Zodiark to take out the sound, Zenos dies in the process. That's my theory lol

[6:33:16] mlm_490: Why do you need Scions if there are not Ascians and Primals?
[6:33:17] sapphirescale: i think some will group up and split into groups
[6:33:19] ObliviousToMe: Ok.. creepy catfish stare is selling this
[6:33:28] NezeruGaming: Ishikawa mentioned requiring the Omega raids for Endwalker's story. People are overlooking that important detail.
[6:33:36] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[6:33:40] OriginalName2: I wonder if his dad is an Ascian agent.

[6:33:55] jeaily: 6.5 ending time skip?
[6:33:58] Renaise: Yeah whatever omegas part is should be interesting
[6:34:00] Ken_Taru: I think at the end of 6.0 the worlds have been "joined" but not in the way the Ascian's wanted. At that point we will start traveling to the other "worlds" which are new continents and dealing with their "issues" which will include the void
[6:34:03] black_magio: @originalname2 I wondered the same thing
[6:34:05] KrazeArcain: the twins dad is defently possesed right?
[6:34:07] Crazeh8: Gaius is a dead 'un

[6:34:36] SNOWWuwu: + estinien ;D
[6:34:37] sapphirescale: i agree with that group
[6:34:38] BelisColdwine: What do you think happens to Y'shtola, with the whole "Looking directly at the aether saps her life" thing?
[6:34:41] Complete_Phased: What about Tataru?
[6:34:41] freaktechnik: alisae and graha are the best b-team in shb
[6:35:03] mlm_490: @SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES Ukelele did not have a real body
[6:35:07] TheWorstTimelime: if anything, I can see Alisaie pulling a Ciri and going on her own adventures
[6:35:09] NezeruGaming: Yshtola is literally the japanese mascot for the game. They can't kill her.
[6:35:10] sapphirescale: i mean they could kill her and mess with everyone
[6:35:16] mlm_490: I did the quest last night
[6:35:20] hielotauro: they're too scared to kill the scions
[6:35:25] disnean: Would be nice if Graha is the main side character

[6:36:07] Renaise: Rowena becomes the big bad for 6.1
[6:36:22] MagusArlanis: I mean... they did develop 2 MMOs at the same time already once before. Something to think about

[6:37:10] mlm_490: I think they are going to sneak Mercidia as a dungeon area in the expansion
[6:37:16] LeGrandCapitaine: let's go to Vanadiel!! the 11th!
[6:37:23] TheWorstTimelime: we going world hopping? coxPog
[6:37:25] KrazeArcain: maybe visit the old world?
[6:37:26] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: NPCs are working on restoring the 13th, so that might be a thing in the future
[6:37:30] ReginaldXIV: 7 worlds are gone aren't they?
[6:37:38] DirtyBird61001: What if we restore all of the other worlds?
[6:37:38] Pyr0_Fr0st: There is always the B-Team
[6:37:47] NezeruGaming: Why did Ishikawa require the Omega series.. monkaHmm
[6:37:52] TheAllBodies: Could it have something to do with Eden and rebalancing ether?
[6:37:56] Riluske: Yeah, I got a feeling the "worlds" are going away
[6:37:59] BroqRox: what about the 13 th
[6:38:00] icawn_: Fandaniel even said that he has no interest in restoring the world as before the sundering
[6:38:07] OhTenGeneral: Except for Pandemonium
[6:38:09] freaktechnik: isn't there also Gaia?
[6:38:12] Lotuxi: i mean if we take out zokiark and hydaelyn we could rejoin. I don't think its a never could happen
[6:38:13] wingzer012: Don't forget Lahabrea
[6:38:16] VoltecZero: Loghrif
[6:38:21] Link1429: Gaia's technically an Ascian as well
[6:38:23] catdragonrose: gaia is alive (loghrif)
[6:38:31] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: There was Dudealphalon or whatever his name is
[6:38:32] CaptHarlock80: loghirif is eden verse savage
[6:38:35] Debuggingfool: worse %100
[6:38:43] SNOWWuwu: there's going to be a plot twist and what we think we did to prevent it, just detered it
[6:38:46] ReginaldXIV: Butties
[6:38:58] Erxmyr: Strong dude with a Phat ass
[6:39:00] Helix919: Venat is technically a unsunder Acian
[6:39:06] JessePfau: Zenos is definitely an ascian experiment
[6:39:09] eathdemon: sound
[6:39:15] Munetani_NJimha: Speaking of Ascians, I don't think we've met Pashtarot, and his linked Esper is Zeromus, just posting this out there :)
[6:39:16] Midnight_Tank: The Sound
[6:39:19] Complete_Phased: The Calamity
[6:39:20] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: The sound from deep within the planet
[6:39:25] Skyform: laavos?
[6:39:26] Skyform: :)
[6:39:27] TrackerSix: The Keening right?
[6:39:29] trifecta89: the sound that gave the ascians fear
[6:39:30] KrazeArcain: the sundering?
[6:39:30] Thannks: JENOVA
[6:39:31] InternetPlumber: Lavos for sure
[6:39:40] Midnight_Tank: @itmeJP The sound came from deep within the planet and make the Ancient's creation magic go haywire
[6:39:42] vaeltis: its always fucking Lavos NotLikeThis
[6:39:44] eathdemon: lavos
[6:39:47] Erxmyr: i wouldnt be surprised if it turns out fandaniel caused the original calamity. Given his current ideology about wanting to die
[6:39:53] TheAllBodies: We will have a spaceship, right?
[6:39:54] ashla11: I thought the sundering was really just the ancients dread literally made manifest
[6:40:02] JessePfau: the "sound" just kickstarted a global domino effect of fear and uncontrolled creation magic
[6:40:03] ReginaldXIV: Jenova would be cool
[6:40:14] DorianCahan: coxSeafood coxSoup
[6:40:18] ReginaldXIV: Or a Jenova like entity
[6:40:24] Lotuxi: we are messing with the timeline. chrono trigger style adventures seem possible
[6:40:26] Reisswind: Also CT had a scythe wielding villain who became our friend.... soooo
[6:40:33] InsanityRequiem: Just bring back Bahamut to save the world. :D
[6:40:53] InsanityRequiem: Go full circle with it.
[6:40:54] KrazeArcain: @InsanityRequiem reverse metor
[6:40:56] Thannks: Give me that JENOVA Soken REMIX
[6:40:58] MrP33Ps: I kinda think they're gonna pull a Chrono Trigger, where you'll die and the Scions will have to resurrect you. That'd be dope
[6:41:04] Dametri: they literally wouldn't even show one zone, just the concept art
[6:41:10] black_magio: oh yeah
[6:41:35] Ken_Taru: omg what if we go back to 1.0
[6:41:36] VoltecZero: Adult Ryne
[6:41:41] Its_The_Lobo: time heist
[6:41:45] SNOWWuwu: we're going back to 1.0
[6:41:45] Xorkrik: Go back to 1.0 Kappa
[6:41:51] freaktechnik: I mean, graha did the time traveling before
[6:41:56] Renaise: Everyone dies but you for a section lol
[6:41:58] Dametri: A Realm Preborn

[6:42:04] OhTenGeneral: I'm still thinking one of the twins does a Louisoix if that's the case
[6:42:07] KrazeArcain: yo we stop the end of 1.0
[6:42:09] black_magio: If there's was time traveling that'd be crazy jaythe4Shock
[6:42:14] Sonatta: we are the bad guys! monkaSHAKE
[6:42:22] SNOWWuwu: Multiverse!
[6:42:29] Lotuxi: and he doesn't even know what happens because of it
[6:42:31] BroqRox: time travel AND parallel univers travel
[6:42:32] SNOWWuwu: and then XVI is created!
[6:42:34] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: I hope there is as little time travel as possible, it makes it so much trickier to fill up plot holes
[6:42:38] jatii: timetravel two expansions in a row would be weird maybe
[6:42:39] Complete_Phased: We cant go back because it sets a time loop
[6:42:50] NezeruGaming: That was Wedge's descendant that discovered time travel.
[6:42:52] Miros__: @itmeJP YoshiP was hiding that it's a crossover with Kingdom Hearts
[6:42:55] KrazeArcain: maybe save the doomed timeline
[6:42:57] Dametri: more insane things have happened in FF
[6:43:05] black_magio: @miros__ lmao
[6:43:07] InternetPlumber: Estinien flies around the planet so fast he goes back in time
[6:43:10] BroqRox: also thats alexander theme lmao
[6:43:10] Ken_Taru: @Miros__ damn you I just spit water
[6:43:15] Grigster: nah Emet would have use the time travel machine
[6:43:17] halebob: the whole moon? might as well be a drgon egg
[6:43:19] JessePfau: the ascians would have used it themselves
[6:43:26] BroqRox: lol
[6:43:27] kalTorakSF: maybe we get a Smash invite PogChamp
[6:43:30] Riluske: World is destroyed, we go to moon, time travel back and save the world
[6:43:31] InternetPlumber: Superman 2
[6:43:32] bakavic: Lavos will be the big bad, and we go back in time to get bahamut's help to stop him
[6:43:33] ReginaldXIV: I got it: You time skip at some point in the story and that's a renewed Azys Lla floating around
[6:43:41] KrazeArcain: alexander was all about time travel
[6:43:46] ashla11: like the flash using the speed force
[6:43:53] voxaetheris: @kalTorakSF ever hear of Ehrgeiz?
[6:43:56] Indiehero5000: what if the moon is a primal...
[6:44:02] Sathias: This is my crazy theory. We, the WoL die. We sacrifice ourself for the greater good. The end of 6.0 is someone finding our soul crystal and inheriting all our jobs.
[6:44:05] DorianCahan: I don’t think it’s time travel. The trailer gives an “end of the world” vibe.
[6:44:12] Coltdiggity: every anime that lives long enough eventually goes to space
[6:44:12] Sonatta: ijpONO
[6:44:17] InternetPlumber: @Indiehero5000 isn't that a new movie thats coming out soon?
[6:44:35] dahak777: will this be on youtube later? missed the start
[6:44:40] Darkaros: yes

[6:44:50] ReginaldXIV: Now nobody serves Hmm
[6:45:00] BroqRox: lol
[6:45:26] Altair900: Gotta have the small focused stuff and the large scale galaxy stuff. Having both is good
[6:45:26] NezeruGaming: WoW jumped the shark, lit it on hellfire, shot it to space, then revived it from the dead to do it again
[6:45:47] SNOWWuwu: Eorzea Two
[6:45:56] Crazeh8: monkaW

[6:46:23] Korhazen: @NezeruGaming imo the only expansions that really twisted WoW lore, was WoD and Shadowlands, all the others were quite involved in the lore
[6:46:25] HooverFan: the fuck is that on the screen
[6:46:39] valedecem11: I think thats the final days. You can see boats and corals
[6:46:41] OriginalName2: It's just a creepy doll. Nothing to be worried about.
[6:46:42] ReginaldXIV: Ascian's homebase is on the 13th
[6:46:54] OriginalName2: Creepy dolls have never done anything wrong ever.
[6:47:00] MistyCooky: legion also fucked wow's lore too much as well with messing with emerald nightmare lore and the entire existense of the nightborne
[6:47:02] Cofsbro: The barriers of all the shards drop so we can travel to all shards and develop diplomatic relations
[6:47:17] Shoaron: monkaS

[6:47:27] Korhazen: @Mistycooky eh not that much, a lot of that stuff wasnt really fleshed out well before
[6:47:30] voxaetheris: Good old power creep
[6:47:30] ReginaldXIV: furryRun
[6:47:32] Darkaros: PADORUPADORU

[6:47:39] aylendawn: padoruCopter
[6:47:40] Sonatta: MCU Crew LUL
[6:47:46] InternetPlumber: MCU crew is leaking
[6:47:56] wingzer012: This ain't Marvel. Yoshi P and the gang won't let that happen.
[6:48:18] zerohour_88: Forward and Back Again, the true 1 hour podcast
[6:48:44] voxaetheris: It's so good. Never thought they could top HW and honestly (upopular opinion maybe) they did it.
[6:48:49] OhTenGeneral: 20? Those are some rookie numbers, gotta pump those up
[6:48:59] hielotauro: it won't
[6:49:19] rixa_faust: coxHypers
[6:49:30] Bregan92: shadowbringer made me a reaction vampire
[6:49:36] Jasott: No
[6:49:45] JessePfau: it was for final QA
[6:49:53] Jasott: That's not why it was delayed. It was delayed so they could be more thorough on QA
[6:50:10] Bregan92: server stability included
[6:50:20] Prrophett: anyone else getting kicked out of Adamatoise?
[6:50:22] jediknight223: I've been watching several streamers play through FFXIV just to their reactions.
[6:50:33] jediknight223: to see*
[6:51:18] InternetPlumber: Finish the Fight coxManleee
[6:51:25] KrazeArcain: final thoughts: one brings darkness, one brings light, two tone echo tumble through time
[6:51:32] Gery01: stormblood is the perfect wingman, it sets up shadowbringers to elevate shadowbringers, and its story continues into endwalker
[6:51:38] Baske_T: what if the bad guy wins?  IE FF14 World of Ruin
[6:51:42] sapphirescale: thats what i am worried about the most tbh
[6:51:49] Jasott: Mabinogi
[6:51:58] Dametri: i can't think of an mmo that has even set itself up for a landing
[6:52:09] NezeruGaming: FFXIV lowkey setting the bar of longterm storytelling in the gaming industry.
[6:52:11] DobbsjustDobbs: ME3 NotLikeThis
[6:52:12] Neragsito: Legend of Heroes Baby!
[6:52:21] SNOWWuwu: What's more confusing Halo or KH series xD
[6:52:22] Mavrick3020: @Neragsito True
[6:52:34] DocsMistake: oh boy podcast time
[6:52:43] voxaetheris: @NezeruGaming idk if there's anything low key about it
[6:52:43] LightsCameraJake: Even dead space couldn't land it
[6:52:46] colourish_: trails has been setting up like a 10 game plus franchise but is still like 10+ years from the end lmao
[6:52:49] Heisuisui: too true
[6:52:50] Sonatta: Amazon will give usthe true ending of the Mass Effect trilogy.... right... right guys? monkaS
[6:52:50] Altair900: The original halo trilogy was a finished fight though. Halo 4 + 5 and now infinite are a new trilogy
[6:52:53] HereForPizza: LUL
[6:52:57] Darkaros: PepeLaugh
[6:53:05] voxaetheris: @Sonatta hey they saved The Expanse at least
[6:53:09] Renaise: The Trails game series lands it well imo
[6:53:11] Nogardknight: I mean, I'd say maybe 1/2 of it is fantastic as long as it involves laguna being on screen
[6:53:29] Nogardknight: because he's the best character in FF8, period
[6:53:54] ReginaldXIV: The whole B-team storyline leading to lore bombs was great
[6:54:00] trifecta89: in yoshi p we trust
[6:54:24] K0V0L: KEKW
[6:54:27] frydragor: Coffee biscuits references were p good
[6:54:33] etap8: LUL
[6:54:38] Neragsito: imagine the WoW team understanding the community instead of telling them "you think you want this, but you really don't"
[6:54:54] Jasott: Correct
[6:54:56] Munetani_NJimha: Yes
[6:55:02] Daruvik: Urianger says he has an idea to reach the moon, and everyone turns and looks at Estinian ijpNODDERS
[6:55:16] ReginaldXIV: lvl 15 at the time
[6:55:30] Sluggs_: its already shit
[6:55:37] Keilali: its already shit
[6:55:37] TheLagiacrus: it's shit, right now
[6:55:42] Jasott: The tower is already there in 5.5, so it's already gone
[6:55:43] OhTenGeneral: It went to shit in 5.3
[6:55:43] icawn_: Isn't already shit due ot the civil war
[6:55:44] etap8: OMEGALUL
[6:56:00] BigWaldo7713: Were the E N
[6:56:04] fosbjorn: So, like Dragon Age Inquisition? Starts with a boom
[6:56:04] Sonatta: will we ever be able to make Garlean player characters and get the power ranger armor?
[6:56:09] Darkaros: Garlemald is gonna look like Detriot
[6:56:16] DorianCahan: Yeah the civil war will have destroyed most of it
[6:56:18] hielotauro: some masterrace
[6:56:21] Nogardknight: Maxima says he's heard from Populares cells that the situation is dire and they need aid and stuff
[6:56:23] ReginaldXIV: Wonder if they'll have CGI cutscenes in Endwalker given how big it'll be
[6:56:31] Deathkanigit101: BR bomb gets set off
[6:56:32] Sluggs_: @Sonatta kind of hard to be garlean and be a player character since they can use magic
[6:56:34] SnackSize: Stormblood preview: "You're going to Garlemald!" -- Shadowbringers preview: "You're going to Garlemald!" -- I'm still not convinced we're actually going there
[6:56:38] Sluggs_: cant
[6:56:48] Sonatta: who knows what endwalker will change @Sluggs_

[6:57:07] ReginaldXIV: Estinien jumped monkaSTEER
[6:57:10] DorianCahan: coxSmile
[6:57:15] Jasott: @Sonatta No and Yes. Garleans can't you make at all so that'd remove ability to be a caster, healer, PLD, GNB, NIN, etc
[6:57:25] LightsCameraJake: Im starting up my FF online journey soon!
[6:57:27] Dametri: I'm here from the future, tataru jumps us to the moon
[6:57:30] SixtyFiveOhSeven: Got it, rushing my time taking
[6:57:35] hielotauro: remember guys if its not as good as previous expansion, it's trash Kappa
[6:57:36] Jasott: Garleans can't use aether*
[6:57:54] jace2010: monkaHmm sure
[6:57:54] SKEWR13: Gotta agree. FF41 is a very cool community
[6:58:00] Deathkanigit101: @Jasott yet
[6:58:10] icawn_: Have you been to this part yet?
[6:58:13] TheAuthoritiesofXIV: oh man @SKEWR13 is playing in 2030
[6:58:17] TheAuthoritiesofXIV: ff41
[6:58:19] Sonatta: Endwalker could change their inability to use magic
[6:58:19] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: Still a bunch of people in limsa talking about going to the moon in /s and /y :(
[6:58:27] fran__frost: I’m turning almost all chat options off
[6:58:28] Nogardknight: pretty much anything besides MCH would be a no-go for a Garlean player character as we know it since they all require aether manipulation
[6:58:29] SKEWR13: @SerenitySunfire LUL
