[4:40:11] Daikurou: i did my fair share of googling for quests, especially for the legendary crafting materials
[4:40:33] Daikurou: yes, better than every weapon in the game
[4:40:39] SabertoothEwok: Not yet, but the mini map bug made me look up how to do it which spoiled it for me
[4:40:48] Carandith: they are

[4:44:09] Carandith: depend if you do all side stuff like legendary
[4:44:09] Darkaros: !rk
[4:44:10] itmeBOT: Ruined King, made by the Battlechaser devs, was released November 16, 2021 on Steam, Epic, GOG, PS4/5, XBOX One, and Switch! JP is enjoying the game a lot and pleasantly surprised by its quality.
[4:44:54] Daikurou: yea, you can just keep playing after beating it

[4:49:54] Boonia: u might wanna try and get Illaoi ult it saved me so much and helped me rocover in a couple fights
[4:49:55] Carandith: they still appear even after doing them
[4:50:17] Daikurou: i mean, you still get the reward
[4:50:34] Daikurou: they just stay in your side quest if you gert them from the rumor guy
[4:50:37] Carandith: bounty work just the quest journal
[4:50:43] SabertoothEwok: The like side quest that tell you to do the bounty are bugged
[4:50:56] Daikurou: hunting ground is a bounty, the hullbreaker
[4:51:04] Carandith: go see the ultimate guy
[4:51:56] Boonia: @itmejp do u wanna know how to get illaoi 3rd ult?
[4:52:00] Necoc: who is Necrit?

[4:53:28] Carandith: there you good for legendary ^^
[4:53:47] Daikurou: you probly have a few pieces of your main party
[4:54:07] Daikurou: MFs is the worst to get imo, but you dont use her
[4:54:14] Carandith: ultimate guy was just my way of making you have the cutescne ^^
[4:55:09] Daikurou: well, Ahri's is actually pretty bad if you dont know what to do
[4:55:57] Daikurou: ye, thats part of it
[4:56:40] Daikurou: you cant really finish ahris without going to Vesani vault
[4:57:05] Carandith: ask if you wanna speed up the process of farming those
[4:57:30] Carandith: check quest log
[4:57:46] Daikurou: you gotta do the arena in Baron's rest
[4:58:01] Daikurou: yea for some reason its the reward
[4:58:06] Carandith: arena last boss yeah
[4:58:29] Daikurou: should be until the last guy maybe second to last
[4:58:31] zucroh: oh yeah, the legendary weapons are beyond broken :)
[4:58:31] GrindyMcGrindy: with the right set up and character, its pretty much an auto win
[4:59:11] Daikurou: how much of ahri's do you have done
[5:00:03] GrindyMcGrindy: 100% agree. needs more than the lifts in bilgewater
[5:00:04] Jukettaja: Or a sprint
[5:00:20] Jukettaja: Oh.
[5:00:23] Carandith: yep tutorial made you thk they was one but no luck
[5:00:26] Jukettaja: A faster sprint then.
[5:00:28] zucroh: or if the 2x combat speed would work in exploring as well
[5:01:28] Daikurou: oh no
[5:01:39] Daikurou: well if ahri isnt your dps and just your healer i guess its fine
[5:01:47] GrindyMcGrindy: @SataruYamate ahri's is story progression locked anyway

[5:10:01] ch0senpotato: lol "too easy"
[5:10:26] Daikurou: i did alot of these with pyke and just abused stealth
[5:10:30] titanodin: LOL
[5:10:33] ChaosKunai: KEKW
[5:10:35] WhiteMilk89: KEKW
[5:10:37] ch0senpotato: ha
[5:10:37] Trevisus: Speaking of money. Did you see Ludwig is going to youtube?
[5:10:41] GrindyMcGrindy: @SataruYamate i used illaoi and abused tentacle healing
[5:10:51] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[5:10:56] Daikurou: true, test of will with tentacle healing also works
[5:11:12] Carandith: need some dispell
[5:12:17] iQHollywood: are you only using illaoi to make the game more difficult?
[5:12:44] RlDennis: I don't know how but whenever JP says 'Let's try this' I get an ad about food LUL
[5:12:48] GrindyMcGrindy: illaoi doesnt make the game more difficult, and tbh by the end i replaced braum with illaoi
[5:12:50] Jormunduur: ads, they rollin
[5:12:52] Carandith: do you have the dispell on the fast lane healing ?
[5:13:13] Carandith: you do
[5:13:15] ch0senpotato: chomp
[5:13:25] Daikurou: i made my illaoi omega tanky, focusing mostlly stamina for her lol. by the end of the game she had like 16k hp
[5:14:07] RlDennis: Ah yes. I cast fist
[5:14:08] GrindyMcGrindy: yeah, illaoi becomes a meat shield self-healer
[5:14:32] Daikurou: need to test of sppirit again
[5:14:35] Carandith: prefer brawn myself with shield and dispell onthe first ultimate
[5:14:41] kibriel: here, but not now
[5:15:04] GrindyMcGrindy: @Carandith ended up replacing braum later with illaoi because the shields didnt scale as well and the healing was better
[5:15:32] Daikurou: damn
[5:15:44] nozzn: illaoi and mf become stupidly good in the final part
[5:16:03] GrindyMcGrindy: @nozzn pyke never stops being good. there's one instance i found where i wish i had MF
[5:16:12] Carandith: pyke dps-dot / brawn taunt-dispell shield / ahri heal-dps-dot (well all in all they all good
[5:16:20] nozzn: mf you go full sunder and she melts everything
[5:16:26] DoctorJohn: dang I didn't expect this game to jeep you this long
[5:16:28] Carandith: dot and dispell i fell is the game here
[5:16:43] Daikurou: mf is good because with her legendary she just perma sunder with her one lane ability
[5:16:53] nozzn: pyke is too slow for me, he does good damage, but too much setup
[5:17:08] Daikurou: also with strut, mf has so many turns
[5:17:09] GrindyMcGrindy: yes
[5:17:30] Carandith: have money to spare ? a merchand sell rune book
[5:17:35] KDRushby: Jp been told about ludwig leaving yet?
[5:17:40] DoctorJohn: I honestly get confused seeing Ahri in non-KDA outfits these days haha, same with Kaisa etc
[5:17:41] KDRushby: to youtube
[5:17:46] Carandith: the one fromt he side quest with his wife trying to kill you
[5:18:10] nozzn: i really hope this game sold well so they can do other stories, personally i loved it
[5:18:21] DoctorJohn: oh another streamer to YouTube? nice
[5:18:35] Darkaros: MmmHmm The news is over for the day. Further news can be (re)told on Wednesday
[5:18:47] Carandith: agree know sqaut about league lore and i enjoy this and arcane a lot ^^
[5:18:49] titanodin: i can see how people get annoying, repeattedly showing up with the same info over and over again
[5:18:53] Angry_Toad: @DoctorJohn  who went to youtube?
[5:19:17] nozzn: just wish they improve the travelling system, its kind of annoying
[5:19:19] GrindyMcGrindy: @nozzn both battle chasers and this are fantastic games
[5:19:56] HighOnStrife: what do people think about this game vs battle chasers: nightwar?
[5:20:01] Daikurou: 2 puzzles in this dungeon to work for ahris legendary
[5:20:08] nozzn: @GrindyMcGrindy i grabbed BC after finishing it, seems fun
[5:20:09] DoctorJohn: @angry_toad that guy in chat said just now, Ludwig
[5:20:16] Exitarnium: I dont remember Battle Chasers being so horrendous with traversing world map
[5:20:19] GrindyMcGrindy: @HighOnStrife this feels like it has some QoL that battle chasers could use
[5:20:48] HighOnStrife: so this game is slightly better then?
[5:20:58] GrindyMcGrindy: i woudlnt try to compare the two?
[5:20:58] Angry_Toad: @DoctorJohn I just joined and the first comment was yours LUL
[5:21:25] Exitarnium: Mechanically Id say this is a big improvement over Battle Chasers
[5:21:26] nozzn: i watched TBs review on it, man i miss him
[5:21:29] HighOnStrife: @GrindyMcGrindy why not? it's a similar game made by the same company.  comparing the two is natural
[5:21:33] Steeltooth493: I played Battle Chasers recently and it still has some bugs
[5:21:44] GrindyMcGrindy: @Steeltooth493 this game has bugs too
[5:21:59] Daikurou: nothing game breaking though
[5:22:01] GrindyMcGrindy: @HighOnStrife because you're comparing a game expanding league's lore and story to a game that continues the battle chasers comics
[5:22:52] HighOnStrife: @GrindyMcGrindy yeah so the story is different. that is one aspect of the comparison. but game play is similar. it's like comparing two FPS games.
[5:22:59] Daikurou: i would not recommend switch version unless you really want to take it around. runs fine, plays well. crashes alot tho
[5:23:05] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[5:23:23] zucroh: i'm guessing a lot of people asked already but why is jp not using MF ? imo she is the strongest dps by far
[5:23:46] Carandith: @GrindyMcGrindy in both i came knowing nothing of the lore so i thk i enjoy them the same way
[5:23:49] Doomwyte: 1 off NotLIkeThis
[5:23:54] Daikurou: because you dont have to be optimal?
[5:24:21] Hedorah89: you need to build more pylons
[5:24:21] GrindyMcGrindy: @HighOnStrife you dont need ot be familiar with league to enjoy ruined king. you kinda have to have an idea of battle chasers story. just because they play similar doesnt mean they are comparable. the combat is basically the same but that's about it. did you enjoy bc/ruined king depending which you played first then you're likely to enjoy either one from that persepctive, but otherwise, like you said, you really shouldnt even compare 2 fpses because they're in the same genre
[5:24:41] Darkaros: FLASH OUT
[5:24:45] Doomwyte: 200 word essay over here
[5:24:46] Carandith: yeah be it MF, pike or yasuo they felt quite good enougth dps
[5:24:47] afreak10: Hmm
[5:25:02] Darkaros: (On a serious note, if you're having a long one-on-one discussion with someone please move it to DMs)
[5:25:09] Daikurou: ahri tho, she feels like a must have in every party
[5:25:12] nozzn: @itmeJP do you have any idea why i experience a small rewind every few minutes or so on twitch?
[5:25:27] titanodin: @Darkaros take it too DM's LUL
[5:25:39] Daikurou: that happened to me on mobile, desltop is fine tho
[5:25:51] nozzn: @itmeJP will try, thanks!
[5:25:57] ItDolan: i used to experience that and did the fix JP just mentioned and it fixed it
[5:26:21] schwed15: !timetravel
[5:28:09] swicxbillionair: dose this gm have auto battle?
[5:28:27] GrindyMcGrindy: pretty sure quick strike is auto battle. i never used
[5:28:30] titanodin: i like how your tank has more than double yours other guys hp
[5:28:31] Daikurou: somehow i wwas level 30(which is max) by the time i got here. didnt even use exp enchant
[5:28:35] Carandith: nope but there is a time 2

[5:31:34] Carandith: @swicxbillionair 6 Pyke Miss fortune and brawn + the one on screen
[5:31:40] swicxbillionair: TY sir
[5:31:48] Darkaros: stripLurk JP has teased that this game is a contender. But as said, the GOTY list isn't ready yet
[5:31:55] Jormunduur: Trying to wrap this up before Endwalker?

[5:36:16] RlDennis: I don't even know how but the games I've played in like the last 5 years or so are mostly from Japanese devs LUL
[5:36:22] titanodin: @Exitarnium could be an item
[5:36:27] GrindyMcGrindy: @Exitarnium probably a weapon/armor/enchant perk
[5:36:28] Carandith: @Exitarnium must be the weapon maybe
[5:36:31] Daikurou: code vein and god eater NODDERS good games @NiloxofAsgard

[5:37:40] NiloxofAsgard: @titanodin true, let him do one thing a thousand time with 1% improvement and he'll say it's a steal of a deal ijpSIP
[5:37:42] Darkaros: I guess I put like 100+ hours in Hades and basically 100%'d it

[5:39:11] NiloxofAsgard: btw Aros you still playing Hunt showdown ?
[5:39:14] titanodin: OUCH
[5:39:46] Darkaros: Ya that's honestly the only game I'm playing regularly atm. Being awful at Hunt with buds LUL
[5:40:25] MomoMurderFace: @chat, pyke or yasou, which is better?
[5:40:27] NiloxofAsgard: @Darkaros understandable, when i was knee deep in Hunt i was playing solo almost every day, wish had friends to play with would play it a bunch more LuL
[5:41:17] titanodin: inst pyke worse lol
[5:41:17] afreak10: he got stealth no ?
[5:41:18] titanodin: isnt
[5:41:21] Daikurou: aoe is always bad for your dps
[5:41:39] titanodin: make it spicy and go 2 tanks lol
[5:41:44] GrindyMcGrindy: @titanodin pyke can usually only be targeted by aoe if you build him for stealth
[5:42:04] Carandith: why people don't like pyke lol he was my beas dps at the end with 10k hit on lane
[5:42:05] Daikurou: somehow my MF has like 11k hp and also stupid high dps, meanwhile ahri stayed the same glass cannon
[5:42:06] thanh_n2004: of course it'd be books
[5:42:17] Angry_Toad: near end game everyone seemed to have aoe attacks, so I ended up getting rid of pyke
[5:42:20] GrindyMcGrindy: @Carandith i used pyke as my primary dps with DoTs.
[5:42:49] titanodin: CLIPPED
[5:42:59] Daikurou: Ahri is really amazing dps if her attack power is high because her Detonnate rune scales with it
[5:43:51] Carandith: Pyke was my corpa too lol with the +50% gold on kill :)
[5:44:11] Whiskeydog23: @itmeJP you playing any pre-season LoL?
[5:44:29] Daikurou: i liked pyke, but i didnt like pyke, he had alot of setup for high dps

[6:02:32] Carandith: Hidden vault/teleport with loot (shrort one)
[6:03:33] Carandith: do'nt ask lol took me 10 min oh well GG
[6:04:04] Daikurou: the worst puzzles in the game were those weird clock like sunlight puzzles
[6:04:13] 1TrueTyrant: Is it just me or ahri talks like shes a Jedi
[6:04:15] Daikurou: i literally just pressed buttons until it worked

[6:05:56] Whiskeydog23: ?
[6:06:10] GrindyMcGrindy: it will be replaced super fast
[6:06:16] silversaint7: it doesnt matter whiskey you will replace it all by like level 75
[6:06:20] silversaint7: 85*
[6:06:22] GrindyMcGrindy: but remember EA/launch augmented gear will be from poetics which is 530
[6:06:30] Daikurou: i imagine EW will be like 495 or 500
[6:06:55] GrindyMcGrindy: 530 will get you to the 85 dungeon
[6:07:05] Daikurou: which is weird because paglthan is 515
[6:07:14] Daikurou: well drops 515
[6:07:59] GrindyMcGrindy: i wish there was a way to speed up ultimate skills
[6:08:05] Daikurou: oh, is it 505. i knew it was 500 something 5
[6:08:20] Whiskeydog23: ok i have 535/520 gear on my DRk but i plan on leveling reaper and taking it through MSQ and i got the 400 gear to start dungeons with didnt know if i needed the 490 crysarium gear too
[6:08:36] yraelvaint: if you have some poetics saved, you can get 520 once EW drops
[6:08:48] Carandith: End boss
[6:08:49] Daikurou: uhh, nno, you have time to do any last minute things before last fight
[6:08:54] GrindyMcGrindy: there's basically 2 boss fights left after this
[6:09:14] Carandith: oh my bad just Endboss but you choose when to go
[6:09:27] Daikurou: you go ti bligewater and then choose when your ready for last fight
[6:10:03] GrindyMcGrindy: you have 2 boss fights left before the last boss

[6:30:00] GrindyMcGrindy: @itmeJP theres a relic item for braum in the poro hole
[6:30:10] Carandith: only if you want brawn legendary
[6:30:42] Daikurou: Braum's just looks like Ornn with a big open fiery mouth
[6:31:34] Carandith: left got a ligth puzzle to memeber for latter
[6:31:36] Daikurou: you need command for that mech i think
[6:31:48] GrindyMcGrindy: @SataruYamate he should have all the memories for the golems at this point
[6:32:16] Daikurou: i left brieflyt to make sammichs
[6:33:29] Papatiku: ahri is so OP, loved her in my party
[6:34:53] Daikurou: the mech covering the light puzzle mentioned earlier is for ahri legendary
[6:35:22] Daikurou: in the bridge room
[6:36:56] yumadarr: by the statue you have to face, that's also for her legendary
[6:37:11] GrindyMcGrindy: yes
[6:37:13] kingofsteam: is braum good in this game?
[6:37:15] Carandith: if i member it's |X| with -- on top but left
[6:37:43] Daikurou: i would take a screenshot/photo of the upcoming solution
[6:38:20] razor1n: the wildcard effect healed you I think
[6:38:56] Bernabus: kk
[6:39:59] Carandith: ok i remember wrong ^^
[6:40:02] Daikurou: the puzzle is passed, through the gate you opened earlier, dont spend 10/20 min on the first light puzzle like i did
[6:40:40] Carandith: not here
[6:40:45] GrindyMcGrindy: go into the final room
[6:40:46] Daikurou: yes, next room
[6:40:51] Carandith: next room
[6:40:54] Carandith: continue quest
[6:41:33] Daikurou: i missed an enchant thing somewhere, i finished the game with 93% done
[6:41:33] Carandith: do'nt be like me and run after every puzzle to find it ^^
[6:42:27] GrindyMcGrindy: @SataruYamate i think thats you missing a quest/bounty
[6:42:56] GrindyMcGrindy: was this puzzle unresponsive for other console players as well or was it just me?
[6:42:59] Daikurou: i did all the bounties, and unless the rumor npcs arent the only ones with sidequests, i did all sidequests too
[6:43:17] DD_The_Shmey: oh hey hows it going?
[6:43:50] Carandith: one of the buhurru temple forge need to orbe thk if you do'nt give them both at the same it can bug and you loose on of the orb
[6:43:54] Daikurou: 3
[6:43:59] Carandith: "two orb"
[6:44:00] yumadarr: @grindymcgrindy I played on switch and had a lot of issues but nothing with the puzzle
[6:44:09] DD_The_Shmey: I missed the MC Crew today, I think i'll catch it on youtube
[6:44:14] Daikurou: facing all the statues the right way is one. and then i totally forget where the first one is lol
[6:44:19] GrindyMcGrindy: @yumadarr played on ps4 and those things were really, really, really fickle.
[6:44:31] DD_The_Shmey: MCU Crew*
[6:45:00] xxunklekarlxx: its a good one
[6:45:16] Carandith: i miss the question :) is it about ahri legendary ? 'one here, one with the statue, last one is the bounty about the guy in the shadow
[6:45:29] jeffisamess: glitch in the matrix
[6:45:33] Whiskeydog23: you said yasuo first
[6:45:37] konvay: thievi2Blaze
[6:45:44] yraelvaint: when i got them all it felt extremely easy
[6:45:46] Daikurou: oh is ahris last one from the veil jumper?
[6:45:54] Carandith: yep veil jumper
[6:46:07] Daikurou: oh well, the statues is the annoying part then
[6:46:23] 1TrueTyrant: #YasuoWasRight
[6:46:26] Daikurou: yea
[6:46:31] Daikurou: one in each vault
[6:46:38] Carandith: depend veil need you to find all 3 hidden chest

[6:48:23] fantomexpls: monkaW
[6:48:27] Daikurou: i think its a lane you have to get inn
[6:48:37] Daikurou: or whatever
[6:50:04] Daikurou: ahri's second lane ability is pretty good, heal when hit and heal on turn start based on essence theft stacks
[6:50:12] Qbush: this is probably the boss i had the hardest time with
[6:52:13] Daikurou: yea, the last reload is a pain against certain bosses
[6:52:24] Daikurou: the fish one especially before going to shadow isles
[6:52:27] yumadarr: I had to spec ahri full healer abilities on a few fights
[6:52:58] Daikurou: ahri can be both dps and healer, but yea, i did spec more into her healer based runes
[6:53:18] xxunklekarlxx: moar dots!
[6:53:19] Daikurou: guardian spirit and the essence theft heal is pretty good
[6:53:20] Whiskeydog23: wonder why they cant keep wind wall up when the tenticles are always up
[6:53:55] razor1n: your party comp is kinda on the squishy side seemingly
[6:54:02] WhiteMilk89: ijpD
[6:54:20] yumadarr: @sataruyamate yeah when ahri reaches 9 stacks she healed for like 10k
[6:54:54] RlDennis: How is Braum on boss fights? Actually haven't really seen him that much
[6:55:02] GrindyMcGrindy: @RlDennis good tank
[6:55:14] Daikurou: luckily respecing is free
[6:55:23] Carandith: @RlDennis damn good tank as long as the boss don't too much aoe and even then
[6:55:50] razor1n: braum's AoE shielding feels pretty nessecary for some boss fights
[6:55:53] Daikurou: both tanks are good, illaoi is heal on hit and braum is barriers, but you cant do much about aoes
[6:56:28] Krugnar: Could try to give Yasuo 30
[6:56:34] Krugnar: life leech
[6:56:52] Daikurou: oh yea, i did play this game on normal, i had no idea this boss would have 80lk hp on hard lol
[6:57:01] GrindyMcGrindy: @SataruYamate its why test of courage or heal on hitting charmed target is nice
[6:57:07] RlDennis: How do the braum stacks work later on in the game? concussive blows with Yas/Illaoi seems pretty good but I'm not 100% what they can do later on in the game LUL
[6:57:16] RlDennis: 100% sure*
[6:57:30] GrindyMcGrindy: @RlDennis concussion on most bosses is just extra damage so braum is mostly going for shielding
[6:57:34] Carandith: yeah shielding help me a lot in hardest diff
[6:57:36] razor1n: concussive is fine, but can't stun bosses
[6:57:37] Daikurou: i thinnk you wanna aim to be in those lanesz
[6:58:01] RlDennis: Ah, was hoping that concussive blows would do something like reduce armor on enemies after certain amount of stacks
[6:58:14] GrindyMcGrindy: @RlDennis no theres another effect for that with sunder armor
[6:58:28] yumadarr: just have to hit him twice to stop it
[6:58:47] zucroh: that 1 shots on normal as well if i remember right
[6:58:52] Daikurou: yes it does
[6:59:05] Daikurou: i remember being wide eyes my 15k hp illoi was dead lol
[7:01:12] Fragmented_Chaos: how long is the game?
[7:01:43] Daikurou: i think the game takes into account rest time on switch or somethng. somehow i ended with like 150 hours
[7:01:55] Daikurou: i have no idea how
[7:01:56] yumadarr: it does yeah I had 147
[7:02:17] xxunklekarlxx: is mercer god?
[7:02:33] Flyspeck42: @xxunklekarlxx he's her lover she killed by accident
[7:02:54] SquidFigther: lol
[7:03:35] ronrab1: Friendship is Murder
[7:03:57] SquidFigther: This making me want to go ahri mid

[7:05:38] MrMontyHShah: mopT
[7:06:03] Daikurou: just like my SMT games
[7:06:06] Darkaros: WeirdDude Gotta assume this is a dumb joke
[7:06:12] thinklike: I 100%;d this game, 86hrs, loved it! I do hope they follow up with another game/dlc. Never played LoL but loved Battle Chasers
[7:06:17] JamestheDaemon: Surprise sammich!
[7:06:24] ronrab1: Sweet, bonus sammich!
[7:06:33] Whiskeydog23: you just have random sandwichs under your desk

[7:57:32] MagisterGir: I think it was meaqnt to be a big reveal long ago but... covid
[7:57:33] Altair900: AFAIK yes, pretty fucked up, but yes
[7:57:33] Kokoianer: we don't really know
[7:57:47] RlDennis: I think we just knew that he was obsessed with bringing his wife back and that he was at the center of the creation of the shadow isles
[7:57:51] sniperoso12: Im pretty sure he was overly clingy if anything
[7:58:01] Darkaros: hypeE K-pop Lich King hypeE
[7:58:02] Carandith: i read a little after the game it seems the sentnel of ligth event and this game do'nt mesh well

[7:58:08] Sonatta: hypeE
[7:58:08] ElPolloBatman: he chonky?
[7:58:09] ReginaldXIV: Oh no he stole the essence of Blitzcrank!
[7:58:14] 1TrueTyrant: Im gonna be honest, the ruined king event failed miserably, like really badly so no one remembers too much about it LUL
[7:58:15] MagisterGir: 5000 years vs 6
[7:58:27] 竹野克里斯: zekeSMRT zekeSMRT
[7:58:37] SarudaBaruda: cohhCrazy cohhCrazy
[7:58:43] Carandith: yeah reddit seems to agree ont he fact that this game lore is great and the sentinel event was not good
[7:59:07] MagisterGir: He hates you to for getting in the way of his QUEEN
[7:59:18] ReginaldXIV: muh queen
[7:59:26] Darkaros: oh no. I can't unsee that the passive smoke around Viego is liek 5 fps
[7:59:29] sniperoso12: In the Sentinel event made it seem like he was a good husband, just after she died he turned into a mess
[7:59:32] zucroh: It's sad riot can't pick a direction and stick with it,the lore could be really great

[8:00:46] Flyspeck42: monkaEyes
[8:00:47] 1TrueTyrant: @Carandith Yeah Skyen made a really good vid breaking down WHY it failed so hard, mainly it was cause it got rushed + covid constraints + plus the ruined king game got delayed considerably so all the pieces fell apart pretty hard
[8:00:49] titanodin: LOL
[8:00:50] WoodBridgeAF: @sapphirescale That is not really going to be possible.  JP will be completing the MSQ.
[8:00:52] storm99413: oof
[8:01:06] MagisterGir: you can't
[8:01:07] sapphirescale: @ReginaldXIV Hmm indded
[8:01:13] zucroh: you should also break the mist barrier no ?only ahri does magic dmg
[8:01:19] sapphirescale: @WoodBridgeAF you see my issue
[8:01:20] SkotimusPrime: hahaha
[8:01:27] Wu1fman411: did it say it was a buff? I think you can't cleanse it if it counts as a buff
[8:01:30] Carandith: @Carandith i'm not into lol and i like this game lore so :) as long i can't have a follow up maybe some day
[8:01:41] WoodBridgeAF: I do see the problem.  I do not see a solution.
[8:01:47] TDotTerror: When I buy this game, Yasuo's probably on the team.
[8:01:49] TDotTerror: Jeez.

[8:08:29] Daikurou: yea, i have no answer for you, this fight is a pain, my ahri kept dieing and the onnly reason my mf didnt as often was because she had 10k hp
[8:08:31] zucroh: are the items from shadow isles not  the best ?
[8:08:44] Carandith: 50 toekn each the black market guy next to fisher got stamina/power stuff
[8:09:23] zucroh: i found a really amazing amulet on a vendor, costs like 60k or something crazy
[8:09:26] titanodin: LUL
[8:09:39] Carandith: 16k amulette vendor yeah
[8:10:37] leonitisreximus: It might help to give Yasuo more stamina so he doesny get 1 ahot by the aoe?

[8:12:55] kongr1994: try and get lvl 30 before the last fight it makes it easier
[8:12:55] Daikurou: ye, and then up the rarity
[8:13:46] zucroh: yeah upgrading to purple gives a ton of stats
[8:14:12] Carandith: nahh do'nt need 30 just upgrade stuff to epic and enchant you good
[8:14:14] kongr1994: i think its like 2 bounties, at least it was for me

[8:18:53] Darkaros: no direct connection to Arcane

[8:19:09] titanodin: @Darkaros same planet lol
[8:19:15] skythe00: goddamn shes cut zekePOG
[8:19:35] Daikurou: Riot has yet to change Arcane to be the canon lore yet, so we will see if they do it
[8:20:24] Daikurou: doing so would be spoilers technically for future seasons
[8:20:32] smashwow: my queen? is this nathanos? Kappa
[8:20:49] skythe00: x8 tentacles POGGERS

[8:24:04] Daikurou: viego is invuln to anyone who isnt in the mist
[8:24:11] yumadarr: can't damage him unless you are in the mist lane
[8:24:17] skythe00: Wu1fman411 but, it looks cool as fuck
