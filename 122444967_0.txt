[5:50:27] DoogieMacGyver: @fungineer_dbstyle, haven't seen anything the past week that implies they have good macro, good individual mechanics, or LCK level coaching or strategy
[5:50:27] VoHiYo_KreyGasm: @fungineer_dbstyle, Definitely valid points, but LCK stacked their talent in such a top-heavy fashion with SKT and KT grouping all the best KR players in the world that an increased level of LPL overall wouldn't mean creating a TEAM able to beat them two
