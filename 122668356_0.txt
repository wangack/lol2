[1:03:27] lostblademan: if c9 went to lck they might not even beat longzhu
[1:03:36] im_moyo: if you play like trash against trash teams, that doesnt inspire confidence
[1:03:40] lostblademan: im no longer talking about c9 or tsm
[1:03:50] cndotahope222: Bjergsen has been better than Jensen for the last 2 years, and is probably the only world class player in NA besides impact. GTFO C9 fanboy
