[1:10:46] captainkrajick: @PatriusW he looks like he's already at his peak
[1:11:05] chen01111: no emotion XD
[1:11:14] rein089: @captainkrajick at least Tian is immortalized in the Takeover MV
[1:11:20] captainkrajick: xiaolaohu is being underrated they should finish top 8
[1:11:24] 力歐恩: nisuuuuuu
[1:11:25] ziosevielspezel: clid announced?
[1:11:31] Toxxxicchd: edg, rng, lng, tes and bld I would expect to be locked top 5, maybe wbg or v5 can surprise
[1:11:46] ziosevielspezel: @captainkrajick  ya im a huge fan of him
[1:11:55] rein089: blg top 5? overestimating them i think
[1:12:10] rein089: i think its edg, rng, lng, tes, and wither weibo or v5
[1:12:12] loltutorial: Dom called them soulless in summer, and I think it is the missing leader... I think Karsa nor Knight are not leading the team
[1:12:13] captainkrajick: BLG has the best topside in the LPL @rein089
[1:12:34] captainkrajick: @rein089 Even without the botlane they make  strong case for top 5
[1:12:41] Toxxxicchd: @captainkrajick wouldnt agree lng or rng for sure best, maybe tes too
[1:12:43] ziosevielspezel: @captainkrajick  you mean LNG
[1:12:53] hwx7e: remember crisp naut at worlds LUL
[1:12:55] melocodelcoco: weird way of saying Flandre and JieJie
[1:13:11] rein089: i do agree breath and weiwei are great, but im not sold on fofo
[1:13:22] clarenceangeloh: Bedge
[1:13:29] captainkrajick: @dancing_with_death LNG is = to Breathe/Weiwei
[1:13:34] Toxxxicchd: last split he looked good
[1:13:43] captainkrajick: @dancing_with_death FoFo to Doinb is clearly Doinb favoured but yeah
[1:13:45] 2274鵝鵝小騎士: i miss jackeylove before
[1:13:53] rinbunbun: Ale better than breathe
[1:13:55] hwx7e: tes worse than tl LUL
[1:14:08] aini99999: kekw
[1:14:09] loltutorial: "I came here to enjoy the pro's lifestyle" , respect! Clap
[1:14:10] Toxxxicchd: ale and tarzan are def better than weiwei breathe
[1:14:13] Thomie80: Will the games comtinue
[1:14:16] captainkrajick: @rinbunbun Did you watch WE vs LNG? even though they won Breathe was still better
[1:14:20] ziosevielspezel: @captainkrajick  I think tarzan is favaoured over weiwei
[1:14:22] 力歐恩: :(
[1:14:32] rein089: rng has a better topside trio i think than blg
[1:14:32] bbrrosseeantt: @toxxxicchd ale and jiejie just clap bin LUL
[1:14:43] hwx7e: EleGiggle EleGiggle EleGiggle
[1:14:44] bbrrosseeantt: bin is better version of breathe
[1:14:44] rinbunbun: nah i saw Ale clapping breathe
[1:14:59] bbrrosseeantt: ale top 5
[1:15:00] Thomie80: Will the games continue after the documentara
[1:15:17] M012345678: @Thomie80 Spring split will start in January
[1:15:31] M012345678: Thanks for watching <3
[1:15:32] Toxxxicchd: ale was rookie and had his first worlds, I expect him to be matured this year
[1:15:38] melocodelcoco: Clap

[1:15:41] leviathan_art: Clap good stuff
[1:15:46] Toxxxicchd: and with doinbs guidance he can be huge
[1:15:47] loltutorial: "Remember this moment of defeat, sadness and despair. Remember it so you can gain power in your hard days trying to avoid this feeling again."
[1:15:54] PatriusW: Clap
[1:15:59] captainkrajick: @rinbunbun Getting solo killed is not clapping Breathe
[1:16:04] liquidlucidity: can't wait for LNG episode
[1:16:08] Toxxxicchd: @rein089 might still happen, lvmao is on the roster
[1:16:11] ziosevielspezel: double ep Pog
[1:16:14] loltutorial: TY @LPL for eng subtitles
[1:16:14] captainkrajick: @rinbunbun in fact I would argue it means the exact opposite
[1:16:17] rein089: wow suning/weibo and lng for christmas
[1:16:29] M012345678: @투우엉 For now, yes
[1:16:33] rinbunbun: @captainkrajick Ale did more than breathe not just clapping him
[1:16:38] rein089: iwandy is better than lvmao right?
[1:16:52] captainkrajick: @rinbunbun the rest of WE was falling apart it's pretty easy to say that
[1:17:02] Toxxxicchd: @rein089 for sure, lvmao maybe better shotcalling but hard to know
[1:17:04] captainkrajick: @rinbunbun but Breathe proved he was better than Ale
[1:17:17] Toxxxicchd: and he is better on bard if that becomes meta
[1:17:20] suomikeri: Clap
[1:17:24] Thomie80: Where can we Watch the demacian cup
