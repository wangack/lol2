[0:45:01] Vanutappi: Got my 3rd booster, hopefully thats enough for now.
[0:45:12] DoctorJohn: it's mildER but yeah haha
[0:45:13] KimBeauSly: I wanted to see Spider-Man but now I’ll probably wait Sadge
[0:45:13] afreak10: Oof
[0:45:19] ghost_sprite: hard to mask up while eating
[0:45:24] Marc326: @busyamateur FFXIV NODDERS
[0:45:28] DoctorJohn: I went to a buffet yesterday too

[0:45:29] k0jak: we need to start using taco bell hot sauces as a scale of intensity
[0:45:36] stoner2k: everyone is just self shaming now
[0:45:37] KatjeMauw: i like (not really) how the British info about it is 2 weeks after the south African one, but now its trustable info
[0:45:38] busyamateur: @busyamateur Right? Like we can't put No Man's Sky since they've redeemed themselves over like twice now and Cyberpunk is not there just yet.
[0:45:40] Killercds: @itmeJP my friend went to a wedding, everyone had been vaccinated, think there were still 80+ confirmed cases from that event
[0:45:48] saini311088: We all going back into lockdown
[0:45:48] appaomega: Regular Covid still out there
[0:45:51] VrtniPatuljak: thats the idea, omicron kills the others
[0:45:53] JeXus1985: I have covid, been locked in the house for 12 days now
[0:45:53] k0jak: how big was the wedding ijpH
[0:45:56] k0jak: ijpHMM
[0:46:05] Dethaven: just in time foe the next mutation
[0:46:12] WDForty: the wish is that as it gets more varients that are more infectious, it also gets less serious/deadly until it's no worse than the common cold
[0:46:14] DoctorJohn: dang how big was this wedding and were they all frenching each other
[0:46:14] appaomega: Vector
[0:46:15] WDForty: but we're not there yet
[0:46:19] Sir_Nerdly: Each infection is a chance for a new variant, so here immunity from natural infection alone is less likely to work out properly.
[0:46:20] Vanutappi: @MajorDuck3344 Sorry mean 3rd shot as in 2nd booster I guess :P
[0:46:24] Sepraxx: Denmark closed many things, like cinema - so we can't see the spider-man
[0:46:26] VrtniPatuljak: spooder mang
[0:46:26] Starlorn: Yeah, Omicron could end up disrupting future transmission

[0:46:43] altizar: super spreader event
[0:46:49] DoctorJohn: anyway guys it's kinda hellish to work in hospitals right now lol
[0:46:52] Killercds: @k0jak about 250 guests; amusingly enough, many medical professionals/Dr's in attendance
[0:46:54] NinjaPandaEU: I haven't watched Spider-Man because cases here are so high and no booster yet for me. peepoSad
[0:46:54] danidude_o7: Well spiderman is a bug! So
[0:46:57] ItsBatsy: The only way im going to watch spiderman is if I can find enough close friends to split the cost of renting a theatre but its 250 so I gotta find a bunch of friends i know are vaxxeds
[0:47:02] Marc326: no mask mandate?
[0:47:02] yrvengalied: theaters want the money

[0:47:12] KatjeMauw: i aint watching it till its stream able
[0:47:13] Moohirim: here its easy, all cinemas are closed, so no spidermans
[0:47:17] yrvengalied: @DoctorJohn yup
[0:47:18] ItsNoxid: had to show the vax card to get in
[0:47:21] DoctorJohn: nah US will not have lock downs again I'm sure of it

[0:47:46] Herophobia: Lol I go out every day
[0:47:47] WDForty: up here in Ontario Canada, the theater i saw Spiderman in had mask requirement, seat booking reserved the seats next to your group so there's a 1 seat buffer between groups, so that worked out good for me cause i had a side asile of 3 seats all to myself
[0:47:50] Dumt: In Sweden, if over 100 people are in the Cinema, you need the card vaccine to prove that you have taken it (+ID) to enter.
[0:47:57] fearcraps26: financially can not afford another full lockdown
[0:48:00] VrtniPatuljak: world had a chance to stop this 1st month, now its here to stay

[0:48:58] woschdvendetta: "..and no one ever heard of them again.."
[0:48:59] sajro94: China did that at the beginning of the pandemic as well.
[0:49:00] FaceMcShooty: in germany we have to be vaccinated and bring a test which was done in the last 24h
[0:49:01] DoctorJohn: @itmejp yeah as a Chinese person it's because they're used to a authoritarian government at this point
[0:49:04] SonicTHI: "hotel"
[0:49:05] Denimco: We have a new lockdown in The Netherlands and it has a huge effect on my work. We decided to take a two week holiday since we have nothing to do
[0:49:14] xelan_star: they locked down the entire town too - but relocated the "positive" ppl

[0:51:17] k0jak: although the NWH did a lot towards changing that
[0:51:22] afreak10: agree
[0:51:24] SZebra: Not sure of Tom Holland is the best person for the role. Too short, not physically imposing.
[0:51:26] DoctorJohn: I'm currently seeing the results of Thanksgiving dinner in the hospital so in January I'm sure we'll see the Christmas gathering consequences lol
[0:51:28] xelan_star: tom holland is too young for that role
[0:51:36] KatjeMauw: to small
[0:51:41] WDForty: Tom Holland has too much of a baby face
[0:51:42] pc2400: baby face?
[0:51:43] Gytax_: It's the babyface maybe
[0:51:45] Layercake: That Uncharted movie smells like a ''Matrix Resurrection'' Kappa
[0:51:50] Andoheim_: howdy
[0:51:55] yrvengalied: Nathen should have been played by an actor in their 30s
[0:51:56] DannyDeVitosHairline: I’ve heard not great things about matrix, which isn’t surprising.
[0:52:01] prfella: @xelan_star but tom is 25 and playing a 16 yr old nathan drake
[0:52:01] Frostbird: He needs visible stubble or something
[0:52:02] k0jak: babyface, plus his spiderman is too nerdy insecure highschooler trope
[0:52:15] KatjeMauw: but thats writing not the actor
[0:52:15] titanodin: no spoils

[0:52:42] k0jak: KatjeMauw that influences the perception of an actor tho. it's kinda how typecasting happens
[0:52:44] Shapelessdnb: I mean Keanu exists
[0:52:45] Killercds: @DoctorJohn East Cost: they still haven't cancelled the NYE ball drop

[0:52:49] Sir_Nerdly: Nathan is 16 in the film right?
[0:52:51] thanh_n2004: Drake is 16 in the movie?
[0:52:51] Layercake: Even Henry Cavill would be a better Nathan Drake Kappa
[0:52:55] pc2400: The guy that plays Sully could have played Nathan
[0:53:01] SzybkiLopez86: J. Cox will be great :)
[0:53:04] Dredstryde: Can  Tom grow a beard?  No flame honest question never seen the guy with facial hair

[0:53:41] xarantur: Isn't he Nathan an Orphan ?
[0:53:43] WDForty: he's not "world famous" yet in the movie
[0:53:43] Tighron: isnt it supposed ot be his first big gig as an adult though?
[0:53:44] DoctorJohn: Nathan drake definitely doesn't have the media literacy to ignore online misinformation
[0:53:45] bakavic: the movie is his origin
[0:53:49] buzzkillington_: He came out the womb as a 21 year old
[0:53:50] DannyDeVitosHairline: Fuck school ima raid some tombs.
[0:53:51] NiloxofAsgard: Jp remmeber Drake grew up in the streets until Sully found him
[0:53:52] Altair900: he isnt world famous in the movie
[0:53:54] Dumt: @SZebra Stephen Amell? Yeah, I can see that. He also has a pretty good comedic timing. I'm counting his roles outside the Arrowverse.
[0:53:58] DoctorJohn: Nathan drake can't legally drink
[0:54:03] Altair900: at least according to the trailer, he got left clues by his brother
[0:54:05] DoctorJohn: Nathan drake is years from renting a car
[0:54:08] Tighron: marky mark is sully? wow i missed that train

[0:58:10] pc2400: The Rock is good in Ballers
[0:58:13] k0jak: NODDERS
[0:58:18] xarantur: Dwayne fits a very certain role
[0:58:20] KatjeMauw: thats actually fair
[0:58:20] WDForty: The Rock has a character he does really well, and not much else apart from there, he has some range, but not much
[0:58:25] k0jak: nobody's saying "wow the rock should win the oscar for best actor"
[0:58:29] DoctorJohn: he stays busy
[0:58:32] DD_The_Shmey: The Rock today is a lot like Arnold Schwarzenegger was when I was growing up
[0:58:32] Layercake: The Rock is a solid actor ...but a great entertainer
[0:58:33] zerohour_88: I think most people expect the Rock when they see the Rock in the movie
[0:58:33] Ravnim: it's about drive
[0:58:34] JumpTroopC5: I wouldn’t want him in certain roles but I find him entertaining
[0:58:35] DoctorJohn: and he works out at like 4am

[0:59:00] Layercake: And Roids Kappa
[0:59:01] WDForty: The Rock is really good when it comes to stunt work and coordination cause he used to do 30 min shows, and now in movies, it's like 2 min shots
[0:59:02] Starlorn: Nick Cage in "Mandy" rocked my world
[0:59:02] fearcraps26: @elektrohase  strong rumours say they are very interested in him
[0:59:05] Hyluhnduh: NODDERS
[0:59:06] Crafteroon: @itmeJP I recently watched the Count of Monte Cristo (2002) with Guy Pearce and Jim Caviezel. Halfway through the film a babyface Henry Cavill appears, it's so weird.

[1:00:21] DoctorJohn: and to me it tastes the same as a 100 dollar bottle
[1:00:21] Mouley17: it is shite also
[1:00:22] SZebra: I have a feeling that The Rock will be this decade's Schwarzenegger. Typecast to hell, and will need to fund his own movies to get serious roles.
[1:00:24] Sir_Nerdly: TeraMana?
[1:00:26] DoctorJohn: what no it tastes great to me
[1:00:28] elektrohase: @fearcraps26 to be fair, he does look good in his role in U.N.C.L.E.

[1:01:26] Sir_Nerdly: I like bourbon and whiskey
[1:01:28] Dredstryde: So what yer saying is The Rock needs a second label - same stuff just costs over 100? thats solid marketing
[1:01:30] imthecheetah20: Proper Twelve?
[1:01:30] KiDisaster: Proper 12
[1:01:31] Neragsito: same @k0jak
[1:01:32] TehMud: I just got back from last minute shopping. I hate shopping but I couldn't get a certain gift for my mom online as I needed to see it in person. Not much just replacing her old old cookware and we are picky about that.

[1:02:34] DD_The_Shmey: @SZebra idk, I think Arnold played about as wide a set of roles as he could have. Think Twins, Kindergarten Cop, that christmas movie that was terrible, Freeze in Batman. He didnt really have much of a range in acting, but he took a variety of roles

[2:18:00] TheodenArratay: @TPLivewire i think last epoch is fucking brilliant, its crafting is great, the classes are all fun and interesting, theyre in beta right now, and so theres no zone randomization and multiplayer, but they intend to add those features in later, if youre a fan of ARPG's its a must play IMO
[2:18:24] TheodenArratay: if not now when it hits 1.0
[2:18:26] Shoaron: this is perfect music for top lane LUL

[2:20:30] sPoiLeD_de: ijpKEK ijp7

[2:25:52] AinzN: Is that like Vengeful Spirit ult from Dota 2?
[2:25:53] Tylerjsmith97: just blind and flip away
[2:25:55] Tylerjsmith97: PepeLaugh
[2:25:59] Catzumo: building pure at speed on teemo severely decrease his dmg
[2:26:30] titanodin: 60% of teemos are trolls LUL
[2:26:45] titanodin: teemo is literally the go too trolling champ
[2:26:48] Tylerjsmith97: is riftmaker built on teemo?
[2:26:55] Tylerjsmith97: i forget what you go after nashors first
[2:26:56] LazyNekos: you can get some amazing normals but also the most toxic and dogshit games
[2:26:58] TheodenArratay: pyke
[2:26:59] Tylerjsmith97: pyke.
[2:26:59] titanodin: pyke
[2:27:10] RlDennis: It's.. definitely possible to build riftmaker
[2:27:27] Fish_n_Twitch: That was your good friend pyke
[2:27:31] RlDennis: I think most would go to liandry's torment mythic thing though
[2:27:38] keogg: POGGERS
[2:27:41] Tylerjsmith97: @RlDennis i just forget what teemo goes for mythic
[2:27:46] titanodin: "MF: Told you"
[2:27:49] jingosaurus: Yeah Liandrys is standard for teemo
[2:27:57] titanodin: LUL
[2:27:58] imfknsweaty: the burn is very effective

[2:30:52] Galoari: they managed to get me back into their games and i hadnt played lol since 2010, i think 2021 is already the riot year :p
[2:30:56] Tylerjsmith97: what summs is Nasus running?

[2:30:59] JonnyFiveO: Don't really know anything about league but lurking here while doing my Xmas baking has been great today. Thanks Jp and merry Christmas!
[2:31:00] Sweet_Threat: nasus Jungle is kinda challanged
[2:31:05] Hese_1: nasus was probably stacking somewhere
[2:31:09] LazyNekos: I did also start playing LoL again due to Arcane
[2:31:29] Tylerjsmith97: yeah not a lot to do in this game
[2:31:34] Tylerjsmith97: just poke at tanks
[2:32:11] Dredstryde: What mythic is he building?
[2:32:47] Hese_1: blind is enough
[2:32:54] Voidcrow_92: Arcane made me play wild rift and ruined king xD
[2:32:57] TheodenArratay: @itmeJP your purpose is to pass butter and blind nasus or yone rooKek
[2:32:59] jingosaurus: JP go Liandrys not riftmaker, it will help with Sion and Nasus
[2:33:11] Jukettaja: Yeah you don't need mythic early on Teemo
[2:33:11] keogg: lianrys better here yeah
[2:33:14] Jukettaja: None of them are that good
[2:33:15] Ozoaken: riftmaker gives true damage it will be fine
[2:33:18] AlterAngelus: would be better vs Nasus/Sion
[2:33:21] jingosaurus: trust <3
[2:33:24] LazyNekos: yeah the hp burn is better
[2:33:25] Gnomeleader213: rift is better than liandrys
[2:33:31] Gnomeleader213: dont do liandrys here
[2:33:35] Ozoaken: liandrys is an aram build
[2:33:36] LeadSailboat: You need to go rift
[2:33:36] robertoredd: liandry's on teemo is built for shrooms, rift is overall
[2:33:44] robertoredd: tis up to you either way
[2:33:45] titanodin: both are good
[2:33:51] LeadSailboat: Rift is better for attack speed tho
[2:34:01] Lemirith: Havent played in years, ap teemo a thing now ?:D
[2:34:02] Pangchop: follow build imo
[2:34:05] LeadSailboat: You need straight AP for liandry’s to be the move
[2:34:08] AinzN: Time to poll it up! ijpSMUG
[2:34:13] pandalisk9: your build is already based around onhit, longer fights, so riftmaker would be better
[2:34:24] titanodin: ya build is geared toward rift
[2:34:46] AinzN: Clap
[2:35:31] afreak10: Clap
[2:35:34] afreak10: pretty good

[2:38:11] zymioi: playing wild rift really understand what is going on in the main game of lol witch is good
[2:38:12] jingosaurus: jp are you aware that you can bounce the mushrooms off of eachother? just curious
[2:38:13] pandalisk9: its good that sion is more int'ing at turrets rather than actually split pushing for pressure
[2:38:18] titanodin: this is going to be one of those games its going to feel bad too lose
[2:38:32] jingosaurus: put one down and then throw another ontop of it

[2:46:11] Price_FTW: ah thanks!
[2:46:12] BarryCarlyon: usually effects windows a lot for no sane reason
[2:46:20] titanodin: throw them on top of each other
[2:46:22] AinzN: Just throw them on top of each other I think they said
[2:46:22] Walshmobile: basically, you throw it on one that's already down
[2:46:23] LegendsOfBobby: you can bounce them off each other
[2:46:24] Walshmobile: and it'll bounce
[2:46:38] RizzinGames: Did you know you never stop clapping just the time between each clap is longer.
[2:46:39] titanodin: no
[2:46:40] Price_FTW: no its just for placing them
[2:46:42] Tylerjsmith97: no
[2:46:44] Walshmobile: nah it's just so you can plant them farther away
[2:46:47] RavaKwoon: RavaKwoon converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[2:46:50] Price_FTW: so you can place them further away by bouncing one to the next
[2:46:50] LegendsOfBobby: more you get some range on throwing a shroom at them
[2:46:51] AinzN: RizzinGames ijp5HEAD
[2:46:53] East_Dragon_: Bouncing will make it go double the distance
[2:46:54] Tylerjsmith97: they go off whenever you step into the radius
[2:47:10] TPLivewire: Can I share a bit of trivia, non-spoilery, easter eggy thing about Spiderman NWH?
[2:47:19] Tylerjsmith97: @itmeJP nah it's more so if you want to just push out lanes super hard and keep minion waves from pushing
[2:47:20] Omakie: hes terrified of you
[2:47:28] Tylerjsmith97: this GP has PTSD
[2:47:30] Shotslol: Hes probably spamming his jungle to gank top cause you're pushed and he's melee vs Teemo LUL
[2:47:40] titanodin: Gp seems to have been traumatized by previous teemos
[2:47:40] Tylerjsmith97: wait he left?
[2:47:42] Tylerjsmith97: HAHAHA
[2:47:44] AinzN: TPLivewire would be careful with that kind of stuff. Maybe save it for Monday when MCUCrew is
[2:47:46] BarryCarlyon: @TPLivewire probably not a good idea
[2:47:47] NiloxofAsgard: @TPLivewire given how recent it is i'd recommend against it
[2:47:57] Shotslol: Teemo is a bully Sadge
[2:48:03] Omakie: id let that push back and freeze it if hes gonna play that passive
[2:48:04] TPLivewire: Got it! Figured I'd ask first :)

[2:59:21] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
