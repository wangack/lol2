[1:34:48] applebananacake: hate teemo
[1:34:52] GraveSalad: @CastIronJake I never really played league but I love hearing his reactions every year. I think he only plays Twitch and it's hilarious each time when he rants and raves about it being different than last year
[1:35:26] ワフルデラ: I put my chat window always at 1 size because I didn't want to read it
[1:36:37] applebananacake: you can use /mute all

[1:38:24] JujuPwns: Hi JP & Chat!
[1:38:30] noelsixty: @AinzN you'll be amazed how many champs are there that have their own version of dash/blink ijpLAUGH
[1:38:31] CastIronJake: @AinzN you can pick flash a "summoner spell" so kinda yeah, but not every champ has an in built flash or move mechanic
[1:38:35] STNbond: only teemo now?

[1:39:14] AinzN: I think that's one thing I won't get used to with League over Dota
[1:39:29] RlDennis: I just realized how chill the music is LUL
[1:39:34] noelsixty: btw ijpHI chat
[1:39:40] AinzN: noelsixty ijpH
[1:39:46] afreak10: baited
[1:39:53] m3rcer: the dmg
[1:39:56] AinzN: RlDennis it's to offset the fast pace tempo of the game
[1:40:02] JimB0b0: Graves is a better champ than you, unfortunately
[1:40:07] Boldie117: Only way you learn is to push them limits.
[1:40:14] CommanderBearded: noelsixty ijpHI
[1:40:19] Gooosfrabaa: @itmeJP the closer graves is to you, the more his auto attack does
[1:40:26] Pistollero1: We back on the Teemo train? ohh boy
[1:40:36] Dougal26: yea graves you want to force him to use his bullets during your blind
[1:40:46] AinzN: Pistollero1 we were never off Teemo!
[1:40:47] CastIronJake: graves is a totally different champ than wheni last played, he was adc last i was around
[1:41:04] Kaleith: I haven't played league in 7 or 8 years, this makes me kinda nostalgic
[1:41:07] RlDennis: Problaby best to build a bit more AP heavy vs Graves since his E gives him stacking armor
[1:41:12] Kalbatronas: graves went form adc to jungle to top and then... back to jungle
[1:41:16] JimB0b0: And if Graves dashes towards you he gets passive armor
[1:41:18] Gooosfrabaa: yeah his damage is unbeatable in close range
[1:41:24] JimB0b0: So he will try to fight you then
[1:41:26] Kalbatronas: and teemo is busted as hell rigth now you jsut have to abuse his q and e a lot
[1:41:26] TehMud: I see you've fallen down the League rabbit hole again Kappa
[1:41:29] VrtniPatuljak: why is he torturing himself with this cursed game on christmas eve?
[1:41:32] CastIronJake: @itmeJP have you tried my man Jarvan
[1:41:48] AinzN: VrtniPatuljak to show Santa he deserves all the presents!
[1:41:54] JasonGrims707: Teemo jungle best teemo
[1:42:08] PangurBanTheCat: He's a weird champ. Not the best for any role, really, but also still kind of useful and annoying. Not good, not bad. Just... Teemo.
[1:42:12] TehMud: Now in my experience of one game of League you just gotta hit the buttons and do things
[1:42:28] BakaOniiChan_: I think something offensive like Aatrox might be more your style. I think he's still pretty good.
[1:42:31] PangurBanTheCat: Pretty accurate.
[1:43:01] RlDennis: He's.. kind of a bully top laner that transitions into map/objective control.. troll champ with the shrooms LUL
[1:43:06] Kalbatronas: nah i had a lto of games where i pulled the nemy with teemo
[1:43:28] noelsixty: Renekton is fun
[1:43:33] jjoseneves: he has to be played to be a lane bully
[1:43:36] Razzyingraz: I like mordekaiser on top
[1:43:36] Daruvik: I always enjoyed Renekton back when I played League
[1:43:41] RlDennis: Have you tried Mordekaiser?
[1:43:42] AltraWolf: my buddy plays Garen and goes 26 and 2 almost every time
[1:43:44] craftycable: Shen is my top lane of choice
[1:43:50] m3rcer: Aatrox Kapa
[1:43:53] m3rcer: Kappa
[1:43:59] noelsixty: Nasus is a good shut-down-my-brain champ
[1:44:08] PangurBanTheCat: I think champs like Darius are more fun to play. You feel like you do more. Teemo is useful, but you don't feel it nearly as much.
[1:44:15] RlDennis: @craftycable The only correct choice
[1:44:19] Kaleith: I'm fun? LuvPeekR
[1:44:28] Dlaurel: kayle is hard but rewarding
[1:44:30] nightsreach: is warmogs mundo still a stupid fun champ?

[1:46:32] AinzN: mayo_on_rice don't do it! You have so much to live for!
[1:46:34] javybavy: Does JP know about the Mobalytics desktop app? It helps a ton for learning the game
[1:46:42] BakaOniiChan_: problem with Kayle is that shes weak early, so you have to play carefull a long time and wont win lane. so you're back to this kinda playstyle.
[1:47:04] CastIronJake: @mayo_on_rice same i played some last night, but then forgot to just turn chat off, because still toxic sometimes
[1:47:38] javybavy: Ah gotcha yeah either of those are good for learning. Items and matchups are the hardest part
[1:47:41] uui23: what is this team comp?
[1:48:26] uui23: ahh the yone/yasuo bot threw me for a loop LUL
[1:48:37] Djoze64: tbh you'd see stuff like this in ranked too, except there'd be more flaming
[1:48:42] javybavy: I see people in high plat / low diamond still build wrong all the time
[1:48:42] garry_leonard: graves us dead
[1:48:46] VioletEden: its the 3 anime boys, a bird and satan comp

[1:50:35] uui23: not going for a mythic 2nd?
[1:50:37] LazyNekos: you always think the teemo blind is shorter then it actually is
[1:50:53] PangurBanTheCat: LOL
[1:50:57] Razzyingraz: noice
[1:51:06] Benrik2010: Is the auto attack build better than the shroom nuke build?
[1:51:06] javybavy: JP get your mythic LUL
[1:51:09] Kaleith: great stationary dodge
[1:51:19] jjoseneves: no mythic LUL
[1:51:42] Liminaly: Teemo, of course it's teemo
[1:51:42] veif__: go more AP than attack speed, its more fun with your ulti then :D
[1:51:50] CDubTheRIPper: monkaW
[1:52:07] Shoaron: really? mythic is the first thing i build always
[1:52:13] AltraWolf: same
[1:52:24] uui23: you don't have to build mythic first for some champs
[1:52:27] Shoaron: then again maybe that's why i'm hard stuck silver LUL
[1:52:35] uui23: but 4th though?
[1:52:35] Damarus914: Tiny Satan saves the game apparently
[1:52:52] HeavHo: Just never build Mythic, new strat
[1:52:54] Muffnar: youmoos is best first item on a bunch of champs
[1:53:17] jjoseneves: with urgot i get the mythic 3rd
[1:53:24] Euphamia_Isilme: most of those people want to quit after the first 5 min too
[1:53:25] soDugger: I usually build the 2-3 componants of a couple of items first, and try to have Mythic by 10min.
[1:53:28] LazyNekos: isn't it better to build mythic asap cause it gives bonus to legendaries that follow ?
[1:53:36] uui23: i guess the build is on AS teemo and none of the mythics actually helps with that i guess
[1:53:39] PangurBanTheCat: Teemo fed. Oh lawd he coming.
[1:53:40] Shoaron: kil lsharing JP its ok
[1:54:15] jjoseneves: kill secure
[1:54:40] EthicaTank: wish rainbow six siege seasons were on this goty list....they are basically DLCs...would def pick one for multiplayer
[1:54:46] garry_leonard: He flashed just to take that kill lol
[1:54:54] oddknight: Anivia has this entire game on her back LUL

[1:55:18] Shoaron: op is populat one
[1:55:19] LazyNekos: I've liked professor gg
[1:55:19] craftycable: porofessor
[1:55:22] Shoaron: mobalytics
[1:55:23] aroobie: porofessor imo
[1:55:27] veif__: porofessor !
[1:55:31] soDugger: I used mobalytics, I think I like blitz better
[1:55:31] SenatraGG: porofessor is the one and only
[1:55:35] knight94r: i like blitz for the timers on the map but i mainly use porofessor
[1:55:36] blue__otter: good game jp
[1:55:38] javybavy: The mobalytics desktop app has everything you want
[1:55:38] DawnofFrost_art: Porofessor is fun cause it tells you your champion ranking
[1:55:42] NvrLucky43: i use mobalytics but never tries poro
[1:55:48] CDubTheRIPper: monkaW
[1:55:49] NvrLucky43: tried*

[1:55:57] uzling: ijpHAPPYG
[1:55:59] SenatraGG: porofessor is the one pros uses
[1:56:45] javybavy: I think he would like mobalytics since it tells you want abilities to level, matchup recommendations, etc
[1:56:54] javybavy: havent used porofessor tho
[1:57:02] Lukergamer: I'm back, how did the doordash story end

[1:57:33] Hangfish: I spy Sam Strippin.
[1:57:36] javybavy: @Survivor_mkII Its to help learn the basics of the game. League is hard to learn
[1:57:57] veif__: with porofessor you can also automatically insert the right runes every match
[1:58:01] EthicaTank: gweneth paltrows head?

[2:07:55] Hoodak_Woodak: yup
[2:08:06] Benrik2010: Not really, garen will spin while blinded
[2:08:09] RlDennis: I really hope riot does one of those concert experience things again.
[2:08:11] polygone3: they probably think its teemo mid and darius top
[2:08:12] Marshtomp1662: Yeah he can still spin on you
[2:08:12] Jukettaja: But Garnen has regen and doesn't rely on auto attacks so he's not that bothered
[2:08:19] Jukettaja: Garen even
[2:08:29] Kaleith: that bee costume has seen a fair share of murders
[2:09:24] raptorscream: they were announced already, fro mteh 29th
[2:09:26] GraveSalad: they announced it already
[2:09:27] Dr4gonb0rn_: it is
[2:09:28] RlDennis: No interest in playing it yourself?
[2:09:36] ghst_WLF: it's already been popping off view wise. Was at 123k the other day
[2:09:48] Dr4gonb0rn_: normally all
[2:09:51] GraveSalad: 28th and 8th is all, then specific
[2:09:53] raptorscream: certain streamers per day

[2:10:16] Marshtomp1662: Yeah
[2:10:16] Dr4gonb0rn_: should be all
[2:10:19] ワフルデラ: NODDERS
[2:10:24] BigFur_: NODDERS give it to everyone
[2:10:26] Marshtomp1662: You do be spittin facts
[2:10:33] Dr4gonb0rn_: new world was a fucking nightmare
[2:10:43] Dr4gonb0rn_: weighted ti bigger streamers and its ass]

[2:11:08] Dr4gonb0rn_: LoL drops when?
[2:11:08] raptorscream: @itmeJP Tarkov Wipe 2 weeks ago
[2:11:09] everkn0wn: The wipe did happen recently
[2:11:10] spinextra: 2 weeks ago was wipe tho?
[2:11:24] Dr4gonb0rn_: I do love me some tarkies though
[2:11:30] raptorscream: new map and new mechanics
[2:11:37] raptorscream: it wasnt about the drops
[2:11:37] freedom18888: its like poe, you dont want to play at the end of the league
[2:11:41] EthicaTank: tarkov wipe is liek an mmo launch...everyopne plays for a month then dies off
[2:11:41] raptorscream: nwo it will be
[2:11:44] Dr4gonb0rn_: but League defo got its hooks in me - cos of Arcane
[2:11:55] RlDennis: I think something that'd be better for the drops system is have a max amount of drops in a single stream, and if you want more. go to a different one.
[2:12:06] Goose07: @EthicaTank HeyGuys
[2:12:08] ChiefBeard: BEEMO!!!!!
[2:12:14] raptorscream: tarkov usually have 1 drop every 3-4 hours
[2:12:23] RlDennis: Something to incentivize going around and finding more streamers rather than just sit in the top streamer's chat LUL
[2:12:47] ChiefBeard: Playing league on Christmas eve? That's a rough one.
[2:12:49] Marshtomp1662: We're going maximum league mode already with these people LUL
[2:12:51] EthicaTank: @Goose07 ijpHI
[2:12:59] raptorscream: here's a better Question, when do people on the ISS celebrate New Years? UTC or GMT?
[2:13:01] RlDennis: His blue might've gotten stolen
[2:13:08] raptorscream: or all day long
[2:13:08] Lobonidas: he was fighting noct on his blue
[2:13:08] Marshtomp1662: He wanted to gank I guess
[2:13:15] knight94r: his jg was invaded and he was asking for help
[2:13:27] ByeBuyingPie: how dare you not to read his mind KEKW
[2:13:29] knight94r: no noc was in his jg
[2:13:30] coolcat2994: Jp you gonna try out the league fighting game??
[2:13:41] garry_leonard: Noc was in the jungle he wanted you to come down
[2:13:41] Kalbatronas: @ByeBuyingPie kalbatL cohhHug
[2:13:46] TDotTerror: @ChiefBeard Nothin' says holiday spirit like League, right?
[2:13:47] ByeBuyingPie: Kalbatronas cohhHug
[2:13:49] Liminaly: should just turn ig chat off and have a more stress free game
[2:13:49] RlDennis: Dunno then maybe he wanted you to help catch enemy jungler that was trying to counterjungle. That's the best I can think of
[2:13:57] SoulCrusher842: League is full of holiday spirit Kappa
[2:14:06] coolcat2994: they main difference between league n dota is creep steal and denying right?
[2:14:21] SoulCrusher842: @coolcat2994 they are completely different
[2:14:26] RlDennis: I'd say turning radius/speed aswell LUL
[2:14:26] DrewPeabut: Dont they have an MMO in the works? Would love that. They have great lore, just not a fan of LoL.
[2:14:27] Kalbatronas: when yoru team dosent help with the counter jungle its just a bad day
[2:14:38] Marshtomp1662: NODDERS
[2:14:44] RlDennis: Ghostcrawler is on the MMO team I believe?
[2:14:48] coolcat2994: when you say completey different how?
[2:14:54] EthicaTank: @RlDennis yup
[2:15:01] raptorscream: creep denying, stealing, couriers, teleporting around the map, on creeps/heroes, stuns last longer
[2:15:07] coolcat2994: i would say hots is completely different
[2:15:11] raptorscream: map is bigger
[2:15:23] raptorscream: also the lanes are "mirrored"
[2:15:25] coolcat2994: so minute stuff
[2:15:38] raptorscream: there's no "bot/top" lanes
[2:15:44] Unkonquered: how's the ranked going jp (if you rank actively)
[2:15:45] RlDennis: Wasn't Riot also helping to fund Frost Giant's upcoming RTS? I remember hearing something like that a while back but never saw any confirmation of it
[2:15:47] coolcat2994: an average player couldnt tell
[2:15:55] EthicaTank: @coolcat2994 very true, biggest difference is people play LoL...they dont play HoTS
[2:15:59] Marshtomp1662: I mean it sounds minute but it definitely makes a big difference
[2:16:00] raptorscream: it's safe lane and offlane, safe lane bot for the ones that are to the left, and otp lane for the others
[2:16:10] Unkonquered: nice, i never made it past silver 1
[2:16:11] SmuttBudgie: cohhJam cohhJam
[2:16:18] Unkonquered: too much rage LUL
[2:16:31] raptorscream: and in comp it's usually 3 safe lane, 1 mid, 1 offlane
[2:16:36] RlDennis: Yeah
[2:16:37] JimB0b0: yep
[2:16:37] Baske_T: yep ult
[2:16:38] Lobonidas: yeah, the super big sword
[2:16:42] knight94r: yeo
[2:16:47] scooterjr37: need boots asap
[2:16:47] coolcat2994: ive only ever played dota 1 serious a long time ago
[2:16:47] Unkonquered: yeah that slams hard
[2:16:50] Lobonidas: its a huge execute
[2:16:52] raptorscream: i dont know about LoL, but i dont think i see a lot of active items
[2:16:56] coolcat2994: so im rusty on the terms
[2:17:00] FieryOctane: Any point in doing ranked during the off-season?
[2:17:07] Lobonidas: @FieryOctane practicing, mostly
[2:17:17] coolcat2994: no bkb and diffusals in Lol?
[2:17:22] raptorscream: also Dota has Aghanims which upgrades skills and ultimates
[2:17:24] RlDennis: @raptorscream Most active items are support items I think, mid laners use a few quitee often aswell
[2:17:49] raptorscream: i see, well, Dota has dmg, passive, healing itmes
[2:17:54] coolcat2994: i stopped playing dota after legion commander came out
[2:17:57] Unkonquered: @itmeJP Garen deals a dmg with bonus dmg for health that an opponent is missing
[2:18:03] Unkonquered: ult
[2:18:04] coolcat2994: use to pub stomp like crazy
[2:18:27] FieryOctane: I just miss hots, god I loved that game
[2:18:33] LegendsOfBobby: dont let him chase you down again
[2:18:38] RlDennis: I'd try to keep a path of shrooms behind me to fall back throu
[2:18:48] malkious: mornin folks
[2:19:10] DrewPeabut: Wild Rift is pretty fun. I like that communication is far more difficult. The toxicity is what keeps me away from LoL
[2:19:31] standingWalrus: @itmejp Any interest in Warframe New War?
[2:19:34] Lobonidas: thats worth

[2:24:11] Unkonquered: never take a teemo without dying yourself, classic
[2:24:14] Lobonidas: thats what we call, a mental kill
[2:24:16] Kaleith: he even used flash just to die PepeLaugh
[2:24:21] Lobonidas: he is tilted now for sure
[2:24:23] jjoseneves: garen its so tilted
[2:24:25] Unkonquered: flash into death meta
[2:24:41] NotYourLad: garen into teemo is a really tough matchup for garen
[2:24:48] NotYourLad: blinding his q damage is rough for him
[2:25:02] PangurBanTheCat: Nobody likes to play against Teemo lol
[2:25:09] Lobonidas: LUL

[2:28:22] Shadokahn: Howdy @itmejp and chat.  So weird going from watching Arcane to seeing the actual game.
[2:28:24] RlDennis: I think he would've survived regardless because of the Soraka there. Without Soraka you would've already won the 1v1 LUL
[2:28:57] PangurBanTheCat: Yeah Soraka is a healing machine
[2:29:42] Daruvik: wear a mask chat
[2:30:08] Deathspate: you need some anti-healing going
[2:30:11] LegendsOfBobby: wear a 3ply surgical mask. they changed what you should be wearing

[2:30:44] Marshtomp1662: LUL

[2:48:18] shadowoflight_: ok actually nice
[2:48:19] Systemic66: @EthicaTank its weird
[2:48:20] EthicaTank: but did they have a survey QR code?
[2:48:24] Kaleith: does it have any bonus stats?
[2:48:27] Price_FTW: smells like... ass you say? count me in
[2:48:29] kainin00: smells like roach
[2:48:43] HeavHo: Wonder why they sent you those gifts, have you even mentioned Witcher stuff recently?
[2:49:06] Kaleith: "please associate our company with the witcher 3 and not with other unnamed games"
[2:49:11] Price_FTW: ignore the colossal failure and focus on our ten year old IP that is blasting off to the moon again!
[2:49:24] NotYourLad: maybe you have a whiskeysweet fan at CDPR
[2:49:31] shadowoflight_: so that's where all the cyberpunk development budget went to
[2:49:41] epicshoo: monkaW feet
[2:49:43] Kaleith: at least it was a cool gift
[2:49:52] EthicaTank: @Systemic66 wonder why some games were omitted?
[2:49:58] Liminaly: Maybe they were nice to people who didn't go out and cdpr bashing for the sake of anger
[2:49:59] epicshoo: hypeE
[2:50:11] Damarus914: Let's get Bee-sy
[2:50:28] Price_FTW: im not sure the bashing was simply out of anger or bandwagon bashing in that case though

[2:51:30] NotYourLad: it's not bad into immobile champs
[2:51:32] Daruvik: AP Trist POGGERS
[2:51:33] NotYourLad: trist mid that is
[2:51:40] YURE1930: they havent picked a top
[2:51:42] YURE1930: i think
[2:51:47] Vaylufa: trynda top?=
[2:51:48] Necrolegion: Suck Bs nuts LUL
[2:51:49] Price_FTW: Trynd top
[2:51:51] Barba06: lux support
[2:51:52] NotYourLad: think it's lux support
[2:51:55] Benrik2010: Trynda top Pog
[2:51:56] warmaku: is corki any good?
[2:51:58] RlDennis: tryndamere into teemo?
[2:52:07] RlDennis: That.. doesn't work out to well for him no?
[2:52:11] NotYourLad: qiyana probably will have a tough time, trist damage at level 3 is pretty tough
[2:52:12] Gurtiess: kill him before 6!
[2:52:24] YURE1930: he is also dangerous early on
[2:52:25] Benrik2010: Just roll him pre 6 and buy armor
[2:52:30] YURE1930: his crits can be insane
[2:52:35] NotYourLad: your team is all about kiting for this one so, decent team game here
[2:52:43] Benrik2010: Surprise crits are scary yea
[2:52:52] RlDennis: It's basically, destroy him pre 6 by blinding when he goes in and then after 6 utilize same strategy as last game vs that garen LUL
[2:52:56] EthicaTank: that is some mellow mushroom background there
[2:53:03] NotYourLad: sessions vi and sessions diana
[2:53:03] AinzN: Slap Chop!
[2:53:05] NotYourLad: only two so far
[2:53:18] Shoaron: only 2 so far
[2:53:18] Akizea: diana's is pretty good
[2:53:28] Akizea: was listening to it famring the 2nd ex trial last night
[2:53:38] Akizea: farming*
[2:53:44] NotYourLad: btw biggest tip against trynd is to try to disengage fighting him when his rage bar is full
[2:53:48] NotYourLad: that's when he'll crit you the most
[2:54:44] NotYourLad: also if he spams his w to get his slow on you, it only works when you're facing away from him. so if you get a read that he's going for it to chase you, you can do a quick turnaround to dodge the slow
[2:54:45] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:54:46] RlDennis: Does control ward actually reveal you with teemo passive in bush though?
[2:54:46] EthicaTank: cvreepy
[2:54:46] AinzN: peepoGiggles
[2:54:51] LeadSailboat: No
[2:54:52] BOOM_KO: tryndamere gains anywhere from 0-35% crit chance from his rage bar
[2:54:56] LeadSailboat: It only shows your outline
[2:54:59] Benrik2010: He builds rage faster by critting and by killing stuff
[2:54:59] Price_FTW: spamming laughter does not in fact increase the happiness of most league of legends players

[2:56:12] everkn0wn: rough matchup for tryn
[2:56:28] nakata545: only until tryn just runs teemo down and nukes him
[2:56:36] Price_FTW: Trynd deciding to not play the game until about 15 mins where he will just backdoor solo push till the end of time
[2:56:46] Lobonidas: the BM back
[2:56:52] Benrik2010: Q max can be the play, in preperation for his inevitable lvl six all in
[2:57:06] NotYourLad: you can def farm early tower plates, he can't do much against you right now without rage
[2:57:22] RlDennis: Problaby let the wave bounce into your tower since Xin is close now
[2:58:23] JeXus1985: yeah he really has no chance before that
[2:58:39] NotYourLad: don't be afraid to ignite him early if he all-ins too for the grevious wounds against his healing
[2:58:41] RlDennis: He might've lost a bit too much farm though. not sure
[2:58:49] tjmiller1988: i love teemo
[2:58:50] Jukettaja: This lane is so horrible for Tryndamere
[2:58:54] nakata545: @JeXus1985 well he can play for crits which is funny
[2:58:54] Jukettaja: Even late game it's just awful
[2:58:57] Benrik2010: Poor trynda PepeHands
[2:59:01] Jukettaja: Blind is such a huge counter
[2:59:02] Price_FTW: in times like these ya gotta be wondering where Eve is.

[2:59:13] RlDennis: You're 20 farm up. You can definitely just buy a cloth armor to be safe when you go back to base and then later upgrade it into zhonya's
[2:59:15] Price_FTW: JP is essentially free for Eve, but shes just not

[2:59:48] scooterjr37: morello good vs him
[2:59:49] epicshoo: KEKLEO
[2:59:49] Lobonidas: with a good mushroom trail you stomp him
[2:59:50] Zhanrax72: save you blind foe when he ults
[2:59:52] AinzN: hypeE ADS! hypeE
[2:59:55] Jukettaja: If you max Blind you win every fight
[3:00:02] JeXus1985: early Oblivion orb might be good against trynd
[3:00:04] nakata545: morello first item is trolling
[3:00:05] Jukettaja: He can't deal damage to you at all
[3:00:05] NotYourLad: no, his ult is the invincible
[3:00:06] JeXus1985: ult is when he can't die
[3:00:09] Cixah: his scream
[3:00:11] NotYourLad: chicken is his w
[3:00:11] Price_FTW: his ult is the no dying thing
[3:00:12] Benrik2010: Ult is scream
[3:00:13] JimB0b0: Chicken is slow
[3:00:14] Dredstryde: His ult is when he cant die
[3:00:14] HeavHo: Ult is scream

[3:00:15] Zhanrax72: makes him unkillable
[3:00:15] Highspring: when he screams
[3:00:16] Daruvik: scream of never dying
[3:00:19] Lobonidas: when he screams and he cant die for 6 secs i believe
[3:00:19] JimB0b0: if you are looking away
[3:00:20] jclester: Undying, He will scream
[3:00:26] JeXus1985: the chicken is the slow, only works when you're running away from him
[3:00:33] Zhanrax72: alos fills his rage
[3:00:39] RlDennis: chicken is W. reduces your movement speed if walking away from him and also lowers your AD (regardless of direction)
[3:00:46] JimB0b0: nice flash
[3:00:58] Benrik2010: Ad came in, just as you got ganked LUL
[3:01:01] AinzN: Wait the flash has a 300 seconds cd?
[3:01:08] Price_FTW: think you just fight there
[3:01:19] Price_FTW: fat minion wave smacking his cheeks together
[3:01:32] Daruvik: it's a bad Trynd, Pog
[3:01:46] NotYourLad: @AinzN yeah flash is very long CD, would be broken without it tbh
[3:01:56] moist_heinous: when trynd has meat he can pretty much kill teemo any time he wants
[3:02:12] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[3:02:19] AinzN: NotYourLad I come form Dota which only a few heroes have blinks/dash abilities that are low cd
[3:02:52] JeXus1985: but then everyone and their mums get Blink Dagger :D
[3:03:06] NotYourLad: @AinzN yeah a lot of champs in league of dashes/movement abilities, flash on champions that are intended to be immobile would be really broken on low CD
[3:03:09] JeXus1985: dota heroes really become walking swiss army knives
[3:03:11] AinzN: JeXus1985 only if you can afford it
[3:03:42] NotYourLad: wtf
[3:03:45] NotYourLad: he didn't ult lmao
[3:03:47] JimB0b0: uhh
[3:03:48] epicshoo: PepegaPls rahghhh
[3:03:50] HeavHo: Wha
[3:03:53] JeXus1985: he didnt get his ult off; ooohh he's fuming guys
[3:03:55] JimB0b0: just didn't click it, I guess
[3:03:56] NotYourLad: he much have fat fingered lmao
[3:04:00] arrowdeath4: uhhhh...what?
[3:04:02] Liffi: I hate teemo
[3:04:03] Price_FTW: if your champ doesnt have a dash/flash/invincibility in League its probably over 5 years old
[3:04:03] moist_heinous: wtf was that
[3:04:05] NotYourLad: free plates, woohoo
[3:04:06] JeXus1985: that must be one maaaaaad Trynda
[3:04:15] moist_heinous: prob forgot to pop ult
[3:04:16] RlDennis: Xin is kinda fed isn't he?
[3:04:17] NotYourLad: he's honestly in a world of hurt now, your next back is really bad for him
[3:04:27] LeadSailboat: The teemo taunt
[3:04:28] JohanSolo_TV: that was a tilted engage if i've ever seen one
[3:04:41] JimB0b0: 3 plates is disgusting
[3:04:42] NotYourLad: what build path is he going?
[3:04:43] LeadSailboat: You can’t do anything but blindly throw your body at teemo
[3:04:45] JimB0b0: You are way ahead now
[3:04:48] epicshoo: KEKLEO
[3:05:13] EthicaTank: so uh...what is CS
[3:05:14] JeXus1985: this music combined with a Teemo wrecking top lane is the best
[3:05:29] JeXus1985: I imagine this is what Teemo hears in his head
[3:05:32] RlDennis: @JeXus1985 It's like listening to classical music in Saints row
[3:05:42] Price_FTW: JP one of the only streamers i watch play league because its a chill/non-rage experience no matter what
[3:05:45] Daruvik: @EthicaTank creep score, number of minor enemies slain, good way to venture how much gold has been earned
[3:05:53] EthicaTank: ah
[3:05:53] RlDennis: Need to keep your blind at the ready for when he goes in
[3:05:55] NotYourLad: agree, also think it's not worth trading with your q when he has ult off CD
[3:06:06] NotYourLad: wastes mana + he can all in after blind goes down
[3:06:07] Cixah: the blind was a little akward, espec so low on mana. But its no big deal
[3:06:09] JimB0b0: I think you just had too much money in your pocket
[3:06:09] EthicaTank: ty daru
[3:06:13] garry_leonard: You should have backed sooner to turn your lead into item. There you were behind because you hadn't backed in a while
[3:06:22] moist_heinous: time to engage or poke is when he uses the spinny thing
[3:06:25] Daruvik: @EthicaTank no problem, and happy holidays SeemsGood
[3:06:33] NotYourLad: there's a brief window for him to get enough crits off unfortunately, but it's just a timing thing
[3:06:52] RlDennis: Later into the game, you can blind him. zhonya's and then blind again. even his ult won't really do much for him in that case
[3:06:54] Price_FTW: odd that there has only been two jungle interactions in the top lane. one by either side.
[3:07:04] NotYourLad: nice free plates
[3:07:05] EthicaTank: @Daruvik happy holidays to you too...just started LoL basically and im like lvl 13 or something...sejuani main :D
[3:07:17] NotYourLad: trist romaing up for T2 gold as well
[3:07:19] NotYourLad: that's strong
[3:07:36] CDubTheRIPper: catJAM
[3:07:50] Price_FTW: hmmmm barbThink
[3:07:56] Daruvik: @EthicaTank Sej is a pretty interesting pick. Take your time with things, there's a lot to learn, and learning what other champions do will help you a lot in knowing how to play against them SeemsGood
[3:07:58] NotYourLad: not the worst though, early T2 top is very good for gold
[3:08:01] NotYourLad: for whole team
[3:08:03] JeXus1985: 2 towers and a kill wasnt the worrst for you
[3:08:13] HeavHo: Yeah, lots of gold, not bad
[3:08:21] NotYourLad: he also didn't get many plates
[3:08:30] NotYourLad: can transition that top adv into drag + bot outer now
[3:08:37] EthicaTank: @Daruvik i like tanking in my games....so i tried out as many as i could and she was just super fun for me...and she looks badass
[3:08:51] epicshoo: monkaW
[3:08:57] SuperKawaiiSandwiches: !followage
[3:08:58] itmeBOT: I don't care about how long how you have been following the channel. I mainly care about how much you have been following the good word of our BotMOM NoorElBahrain!! In helpful bot news, you can click on your own username on PC to see how long you've been following the channel.
[3:08:58] NotYourLad: @EthicaTank sej is very good right now with glacial augment rune path
[3:09:05] AinzN: No more music! ijpS
[3:09:10] NotYourLad: lots of utility to go along with tank stats
[3:09:24] Daruvik: @EthicaTank yeah, tank champs are some of my favorites too, my main was Amumu way back when the game first came out, he's good for stunlocking a whole team too ;)
[3:09:31] RlDennis: @EthicaTank Sejuani is a really good pick when you have melee champions top and mid. (Definitely try her when you have a katarina mid lane)
[3:09:43] NotYourLad: if you like sej, also recommend amumu, ornn, sion
[3:09:48] NotYourLad: maybe malphite as well
[3:09:52] EthicaTank: @NotYourLad good to know...haventr played since endwalker came out but im caught up on everything for now so ill start lol back up
[3:09:56] SuperKawaiiSandwiches: Well I didnt know clicking on my own name would say so, but I like to stop by and be like happy 4 years. <3 I hope youre having a great stream!
[3:10:20] RlDennis: Honestly, I'd say give Gragas a try aswell. Can build tanky, buut has the option to be a bit more damage heavy
[3:10:32] EthicaTank: @NotYourLad i liked the dragon lady...cant remember her name
[3:10:34] RlDennis: Similar opening on both champs, Dash in to cc
[3:10:39] NotYourLad: @NotYourLad shyvana
[3:10:43] EthicaTank: yea
[3:10:49] NotYourLad: shyvana is fun because she has three viable build paths
[3:11:03] thekingofthewolf1: modCheck
[3:11:08] NotYourLad: you can build her with a bruiser/on-hit build, or you can go full AP
[3:11:09] noble_arya: modCheck

[3:11:40] NotYourLad: @EthicaTank pick maybe 3 champs to play top and jungle to learn if you like playing tanks
[3:11:51] AinzN: EthicaTank that's cheating!
[3:11:54] Kaleith: any time now MmmHmm
[3:12:00] epicshoo: monkaS

[3:12:16] Price_FTW: not sure we can stop it ourselves
[3:12:18] NotYourLad: @EthicaTank would personally recommend malphite, shen, ornn for top and sej, amumu, and shyvana for jungle

[3:16:08] itmeBOT: Hey @cixah, just a friendly reminder that you have yet to choose someone to timeout.
[3:16:09] AinzN: Cixah there might be a time limit on who you can T/O
[3:16:23] Cixah: prolly if i lose 100k whatevs
[3:16:38] EthicaTank: @Cixah time out @ing
[3:16:42] EthicaTank: he deserves it again
[3:16:43] Price_FTW: came is looking close
[3:16:43] RlDennis: We just spent 300k to timeout a single person for 10 minutes LUL
[3:16:46] Cixah: @ing
[3:16:46] itmeBOT: @cixah, I recently timed out ing, lets give them a breather from the ban hammer. You can either Timeout someone else or wait :-)

[3:17:45] AinzN: Daruvik ijp7
[3:17:53] itmeBOT: Hey @daruvik, This timeout is sponsered by RAID SHADOW... I mean @cixah, See you in 10 mins.
[3:17:57] NotYourLad: is this the only teemo skin you have jp? personal favorite is little devil

[3:19:47] GoldSmog: hasWut
[3:19:55] omgitsjason: yu should ofignited
[3:20:22] NotYourLad: bot -> drag
[3:20:36] NotYourLad: nah, ignite would have been probably useless in the end because of her shield
[3:20:39] JeXus1985: ignite+your poision is a sick amount, not sure if it woudlve been enough
[3:20:41] omgitsjason: nah but it would of looked cool
[3:20:47] DrYaguar: he ded
[3:20:48] omgitsjason: Kappa
[3:20:50] Lemirith: I think the flash was used too early, the ignite wouldnt have sufficed she can shield
[3:20:52] nakata545: at this point, ignite is around 12% on squishies
[3:20:54] Price_FTW: Trist keeping them in it Sadge
[3:21:10] NotYourLad: forgot to blind :(
[3:21:11] Madracah: Q ;/
[3:21:25] NotYourLad: got the eve to stop drag tho
[3:21:29] Price_FTW: close match
[3:21:31] dotdotdotcrew: !GOTY
[3:21:31] itmeBOT: It's time for the Dropped Frames Game Of The Year Viewer Poll! The results will be revealed in the Dropped Frames GOTY episode. If you wish to vote, visit https://itme.jp/goty
[3:21:33] ludwigvanrekthoven: jp playing league, never thought I'd see the day
[3:21:49] GaryArkham: they are behind, I'd go 5v5 while you are ahead
[3:21:59] birkhoms: some things never change, never attack a tryn that didn't burn his ulti yet
[3:22:02] RlDennis: Would've been a hilarious steal if the shroom got it LUL
[3:22:07] SickLiq: trist had ult and didn't use it
[3:22:08] NotYourLad: he's a mega lategame carry, yeah
[3:22:18] Lindobu: YEP trynd
[3:22:18] Price_FTW: this is the traditional role of Tryndamere
[3:22:33] Price_FTW: support BTW
[3:22:41] AinzN: itmejpDANCE itmejpDANCE itmejpDANCE
[3:22:41] Hopsinka: catJAM
[3:22:57] Price_FTW: Trist prolly
[3:22:58] nakata545: its a bad draft diff
[3:23:02] Lindobu: "support" role is busted anyway
[3:23:05] arrowdeath4: well, as they say: lose lane, win game
[3:23:07] Price_FTW: Trist stay running it down
[3:23:10] NotYourLad: nobody really to blame but whole team is a bit uncoordinated
[3:23:14] RlDennis: You know, now that you mention it. I haven't really seen Senna much at all
[3:23:15] nakata545: just got outscaled by a better late game comp
[3:23:22] NotYourLad: lots of individual all-ins against qiyana/trynd = bad time
[3:23:28] Damarus914: Jungler. Always blame the jungler. Except if you are the jungler.
[3:23:39] arrowdeath4: yes, if you're the jungler, you blame the support
[3:23:40] Jukettaja: You can still win if you blind Tryndamere at a crucial moment
[3:23:41] RlDennis: You need stopwatch to win vs Trynd
[3:23:55] pandalisk9: to be fair, in a teamfight situation you can really mess with his 1v5 ability
[3:23:55] Madracah: max Q has like 2 sec downtime. Trynd should be useless if your near
[3:23:57] RlDennis: Yeah, blind into stopwatch into another blind and you should win
[3:23:58] Deathspate: you're all playing like turds, equal blame everywhere
[3:23:59] Price_FTW: if team has an exhaust it needs to go on Trynd every fight
[3:24:03] garry_leonard: I'd also say trynd was in more of the team fights
[3:24:24] NotYourLad: i think your last hope is a legit 5v5 where you can blind trynd for your team to get off enough damage
[3:24:43] arrowdeath4: there ain't going to be a 5v5, it looks like
[3:24:48] arrowdeath4: that xin is insane
[3:24:55] NotYourLad: bad fight for xin to take tbh
[3:25:00] RlDennis: he doesnt have ult now does he?
[3:25:02] NotYourLad: you can't get through the choke there
[3:25:08] Lemirith: He just left the team unable to join him for several seconds:(
[3:25:15] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[3:26:48] pandalisk9: quiyana is more spell based than autos
[3:26:50] nakata545: thats a "worth" right there
[3:26:53] epicshoo: Madge dang devil teemo
[3:26:57] arrowdeath4: "werf"
[3:27:02] malavrana: this little evile/angel scout
[3:27:05] RlDennis: Problaby buy an elixir since you won't finish zhonya's for a while right?
[3:27:06] Deathspate: Right now, my backseat advice would be to setup shrooms  to prep for major objectives, you don't wanna focus on lanes but chipping enemies before teamfights
[3:27:07] hamez94: hamez94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months!

[3:28:39] VanityOfViolet: why is jp playing league lol
[3:28:40] RlDennis: Wow, that ult was so late from Xin LUL
[3:28:42] CastIronJake: i haven't played with a yumi before  is it basically just stuck to people at best
[3:28:42] pandalisk9: xin shouldve ulted alot earlier to block lux burst
[3:28:49] nakata545: ADC had no chance against all that dive
[3:28:59] Daruvik: This game needs more characters that use books for weapons ijpNODDERS
[3:29:07] nakata545: trynd qiyana and eve is hell for adc
[3:29:18] Hopsinka: KEKW
[3:29:23] chazlupine: @CastIronJake Yes Yuumi is carry the fed ppl. if no one is fed on your team you are kinda useless.
[3:29:25] Deathspate: @Daruvik do you mean like a magical tome or they use the book to beat people with?
[3:29:31] CastIronJake: gotcha

[3:29:48] Daruvik: @Daruvik yes
[3:30:11] Crome18: senna was just a bad pick in that game
[3:30:15] RlDennis: It's kinda hard being an adc vs Evelynn/Qiyana/Tryndamere aswell
[3:30:19] Deathspate: That's normal Yuumi things LUL
[3:30:22] Hopsinka: forsenPls
[3:30:25] SmuttBudgie: cohhJam
[3:30:28] Crome18: the hard dive made it impossible to do anything
[3:30:41] FluentZap: The ADC life is not easy
[3:30:50] RlDennis: Nah, being an adc is easy. Being a good adc is hard ijpKEK
[3:31:02] pandalisk9: when i get put adc i just default to the new crown kaisa build so i get to play the game stripLUL
[3:31:26] omgitsjason: she just got buffed
[3:31:29] omgitsjason: i trhink
[3:31:44] pandalisk9: probably. she has crazy poke with W, but also deals good dmg with autos still using the passive and muramana
[3:31:54] pandalisk9: and crown gives her burst survivability
[3:32:20] jclester: monkaS
[3:32:32] DJSketch04: WTF was that
[3:32:35] Deathspate: Kai'sa is always good imo, best skins and her autoes feel so satisfactory Kreygasm
[3:32:46] DJSketch04: dang SteamDeck
[3:33:16] VanityOfViolet: ww pog
[3:33:17] Deathspate: Lux just wanted one black coffee Sadge
[3:33:23] pandalisk9: my current favorite thing to play is the new chinese corki build thats gotten popular stripBad
[3:33:24] Akizea: hes just always been solid since rework
[3:33:24] Daruvik: ijpSHRUG
[3:33:31] LGNDRYNRG: probably just Arcane hype tbh
[3:33:31] ludwigvanrekthoven: what made JP pick up league (again?), did he say?
[3:33:32] Deathspate: Arcane?
[3:33:35] Crome18: WW is a lowelo king
[3:33:38] Crome18: that is all
[3:33:41] Liminaly: @Deathspate shush
[3:33:42] jclester: WW just solid all arounder
[3:33:51] AinzN: !whyleague
[3:33:54] Deathspate: All the LoL plebs know he's coming, I've seen his PR spike @Liminaly
[3:34:01] AinzN: I know there is a command for it
[3:34:21] itmeJP: !whylol
[3:34:21] RlDennis: isnt it whylol
[3:34:21] itmeBOT: Did you know that JP's beloved, Aureylian, is Riot Games' Global Head of Player Community? JP now wants to learn League of Legends to connect with her and her co-workers ijpLOVE https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1444862232140070912
[3:34:25] ludwigvanrekthoven: gotcha, thanks for answering
[3:34:34] AinzN: Couldn't remember if it was lol or league for it
[3:34:34] Price_FTW: I enjoy watching the JP league content
[3:34:38] Crome18: so JP what is better Dota2 vs lol
[3:34:41] ChrisHimself: @itmeJP Do I smell a Teemo OTP here?
[3:34:45] Deathspate: Oh look, Shaco, what a trash champ (says the guy with the name Shaco LUL )
[3:35:04] RlDennis: Honestly surprised to not see you play some more halo infinite multiplayer
[3:35:06] Crome18: thats fine :D
[3:35:10] Hopsinka: game industry is kinda dry on new games atm
[3:35:14] JeXus1985: well, no fun allowed game with a shaco in the house
[3:35:18] LGNDRYNRG: thank you so much for saying "shay-co" and not "shack-o"
[3:35:19] epicshoo: die?
[3:35:20] DrYaguar: cry
[3:35:25] RlDennis: Ornn? your own thing while surviving LUL
[3:35:25] MTVaughn: poke
[3:35:27] ApexBaker: wonder why WW banned yi, he hard counters yi
[3:35:34] Deathspate: I would go grasp
[3:35:35] JimB0b0: watch out for walls and pillars
[3:35:37] Crome18: poke him so he has to go out of lane
[3:35:40] CastIronJake: I'm back to it because it's the only thing my computer can play since im down to only a laptop now ijpSAD ijpSHRUG
[3:35:40] pandalisk9: avoid getting hit by the last tic of his flame breath, dont hug walls/terrian
[3:35:42] Whatnos: dont let him melee you because he's unironically a tank+assassin
[3:35:42] Daruvik: I miss the days of old where Sunfire Cape stacked, and Shaco's ult-clone's sunfires did damage LUL
[3:35:46] sIllverback: Teemo player DansGame
[3:35:52] RlDennis: Just farm up and mess the enemy team up with shrooms I guess
[3:35:57] omgitsjason: Garen is good into Ornn
[3:35:59] karrotglace: farm and stay out of wave
[3:36:14] Deathspate: @Daruvik I miss old Shaco Sadge , fucking assassin update was trash Madge
[3:36:15] Lcnt: dont stand next to walls
[3:36:31] Price_FTW: i honestly hate shaco.. stupid champ
[3:36:40] JeXus1985: Azir is great
[3:36:40] sIllverback: for the most part yes
[3:36:44] omgitsjason: in solo queue yes lol
[3:36:44] VanityOfViolet: he's hard to play but can be really good
[3:36:45] Theagent203: hes very hard
[3:36:45] RlDennis: Azir is.. very hard to play well
[3:36:45] JeXus1985: so much fun to play
[3:36:46] epicshoo: D: how dare
[3:36:47] KaiGoesMoo: He's just hard to play well
[3:36:52] Crome18: Azir is super hard to play
[3:36:58] pandalisk9: the final part of his flame breath with debuff you, and he can then auto you for % hp dmg
[3:37:09] Cixah: tanky
[3:37:11] JimB0b0: no
[3:37:11] Deathspate: Azir is in the same category of Ryze and Akali, great at high elo but dumpster at low
[3:37:12] Hexionas: no
[3:37:13] Cixah: not regen heavy
[3:37:16] Hexionas: he is just a tanky mofo
[3:37:16] sIllverback: hes a beefy boi
[3:37:20] Crome18: no only regen
[3:37:37] Baludor: Ornn does a surprising amount of damage though
[3:37:39] epicshoo: pepeD
[3:37:40] RlDennis: Ornn is mega tank. His passive gives him more armor/mr per item and allows him to upgrade items later on
[3:37:51] Lcnt: Ornn big and Ornn like to bonk
[3:37:53] Kaleith: catJAM
[3:37:54] Hexionas: he doesnt need to base for buy
[3:37:55] Hopsinka: docPls
[3:38:00] RlDennis: Oh he started W that's bad for him, gotta punish that
[3:38:01] ludwigvanrekthoven: fairlightx and now JP playing league almost make me itch to pick up the game myself again after like...7? year of not having played it. curse you *shakes fist at streamers*
[3:38:06] Arsicx: should've all ined him
[3:38:22] Whatnos: @itmeJP make sure to interrupt ornn if he starts hammering his anvil. it means he's buying an item in lane
[3:38:33] Deathspate: God Teemo is a little shit LUL
[3:38:39] an_kush: LUL
[3:38:40] Kaleith: today I got some unusually high latency to broadcaster for some reason, I see chat responding to things that haven't happened on stream yet Sadge
[3:39:09] pandalisk9: at lvl 3 he can ram that pillar to knockup you
[3:39:09] Baludor: He'll jump to the wall at level 3 and it's a huge knockup
[3:39:11] an_kush: Jp you stopped playing strive?
[3:39:43] JimB0b0: The breath is really important for his damage
[3:39:45] omgitsjason: JP He does % Health dmg after he breaths on you
[3:39:45] RlDennis: ijpTOTSUGEKI ijpSAD
[3:39:53] LGNDRYNRG: excited for DNF duel?
[3:39:55] RlDennis: and lowers you armor?
[3:39:57] enricofairme: monkaS
[3:40:06] Deathspate: What would you say is the reason you stopped Strive? Just no feeling to pick it back up or dissuaded?
[3:40:08] RlDennis: I think brittle lowers your armor aswell right?
[3:40:12] DrYaguar: double kill in bot incoming
[3:40:22] Deathspate: @RlDennis Nah, it extends CC
[3:40:27] RlDennis: Ah right
[3:40:30] LGNDRYNRG: @DrYaguar ah, a prophet
[3:40:41] RlDennis: Katarina/Shaco gank bot
[3:40:43] Price_FTW: not quite a prophet he said double not all kill
[3:40:47] an_kush: the shaco gank easy
[3:40:48] Kaleith: they're having fun apparently
[3:40:53] Deathspate: assassin orgy
[3:40:55] JimB0b0: You should try to zone him off the wave
[3:41:07] RlDennis: The fact they got 2 kills is pretty decent tbh because Azir is just hitting mid tower LUL
[3:41:25] Slade1760: The concentration, it's impeccable
[3:41:42] RlDennis: Yeah
[3:41:43] sIllverback: big ram
[3:41:44] omgitsjason: the big ghost ram
[3:41:49] Whatnos: yeah the ornn horn
[3:41:49] Price_FTW: sheep
[3:41:49] Baske_T: he summons a Ram that kncoks you up
[3:41:55] RlDennis: Ornn hornn
[3:42:01] Price_FTW: sheep go zoom
[3:42:08] LGNDRYNRG: ram**
[3:42:18] Price_FTW: horny sheep go zoom
[3:42:20] Liminaly: Ramming speed Captain!
[3:42:26] RlDennis: Honestly one of my favorite ults in the game LUL it's just so satisfying hearing the horn go off
[3:42:27] LGNDRYNRG: perfection @Price_FTW
[3:42:40] LeadSailboat: Sheep comes at orn applies debuff going towards him and then he headbutts it out and knocks up
[3:42:45] Deathspate: ngl, you're 'losing' this lane JP
[3:43:18] JimB0b0: Yeah, pretty much
[3:43:25] Shoaron: 1 kill is equal to about an entire wave iirc
[3:43:25] Liminaly: probaly magic pen
[3:43:25] mastergejo: and a kill, and scaling
[3:43:27] FluentZap: LUL
[3:43:30] JimB0b0: It's hard when it's a new matchup
[3:43:31] Killian_Hart: orn is hard to deal with if you aren't tanky
[3:43:36] Whatnos: ornn winning lane is just him being alive to gain exp
[3:43:50] Kalbatronas: should have goten the magick penetration boots there
[3:43:57] Deathspate: Ornn scales by just existing, you supposed to bully him off his farm
[3:44:12] Deathspate: But yeah, I know you don't know him, so it's fine
[3:44:17] pandalisk9: ornn is a difficult lane in general, having boots to avoid his knockup is good
[3:44:26] Deathspate: It's low elo tho, so hopefully he fucks it up
[3:44:58] Deathspate: oof
[3:45:18] aideh: @raptorscream Thanks for the gift sub!
[3:45:27] Lcnt: expecting the Christmas miracle of jungle presence top :)
[3:45:37] ludwigvanrekthoven: shrooms mvp
[3:45:39] CDubTheRIPper: danK
[3:45:45] Deathspate: @Lcnt aye, i gank top aite
[3:45:48] JimB0b0: WW just missed
[3:45:59] pandalisk9: was a kill if ww landed ult
[3:46:06] JimB0b0: the freest ult in the world and he just whiffed
[3:46:07] Deathspate: the guy auto'ed minions twice KEKW
[3:46:33] wakummaci: refillable and ward?
[3:46:41] pandalisk9: no, its a skillshot leap
[3:46:43] Baske_T: not anmore, its a skill shto now
[3:46:45] JimB0b0: It's a skillshot now
[3:46:49] Natjen8: no its a skillshot
[3:46:49] Daruvik: used to be that way, changed a while ago
[3:47:11] LegendsOfBobby: took wws skillshot ult away because to easy. but malz still has it and so does vi
[3:47:36] JimB0b0: Getting Liandry's will help a lot
[3:47:42] Baludor: Shroom herald and around the jungle to get some pressure outside of lane maybe
[3:47:52] Baludor: Since you're not gonna be able to do much to Ornn
[3:47:53] Deathspate: honestly, it was a meme back then about how Riot was making everything a skillshot, but rework WW's ult is really fucking cool
[3:47:53] Elyoslayer: you don't hjust leave lane in league
[3:47:54] Whatnos: @LegendsOfBobby I get what you're saying but malz doesnt teleport suddenly and vi's is telegraphed
[3:47:59] Necrocosm: you need magic pen
[3:48:00] LeadSailboat: You can camp their jg
[3:48:02] Natjen8: yeah but does teemo really add much by going to other lanes?
[3:48:04] LeadSailboat: With Sharon’s
[3:48:15] LeadSailboat: Shrooms
[3:48:19] Natjen8: you're keeping up a decent cs lead so there's that
[3:48:26] applebananacake: teeemooo
[3:48:29] Greywind424: ornn will just wait it out until late game. then he will be able to upgrade his and his teammates items
[3:48:32] omgitsjason: its an item
[3:48:35] JimB0b0: An item he built
[3:48:35] Rezz284: an item
[3:48:41] omgitsjason: its an anti split push item
[3:48:45] omgitsjason: iirc
[3:48:49] DrYaguar: @natjen8 he can fuck with their jungler which has an impact of the rest of the team
[3:49:02] Natjen8: @natjen8 true i guess he can shroom up the topside jungle
[3:49:07] pandalisk9: essentially he is stronger vs you specifically from now on
[3:49:13] Baludor: The item really helps him fight you solo
[3:49:59] aideh: is AP teemo still a thing?

[3:51:36] the_real_beardcat: Capital G Gamer
[3:51:58] Baludor: I would start shrooming objectives and enemy jungle instead
[3:51:59] cordonez23: @itmeJP when facing a tank building hp you should build blade of the ruined king as 1st item
[3:52:00] Radcosh: welcome to teemo
[3:52:06] dunnajd: because of Anathema's
[3:52:15] Daruvik: Liandry's should make him care a bit
[3:52:20] Deathspate: you're gonna get ganked probs
[3:52:22] Killian_Hart: at this stage you can start dumping shrooms in the enemy jungle when he's pushed. not much you can do to orn
[3:52:22] Baludor: You have more mobility than Ornn, so you can control the map instead of lane
[3:52:29] PangurBanTheCat: Yeah you need items to counter I guess. Just farm and exist I guess. Not a fun lane to be in.
[3:52:49] LordMannix: I'd recommend you start roaming and assisting the other lanes you wont be able to beat him on your own.
[3:53:01] LordMannix: you're strong just not against a tank
[3:53:10] Deathspate: Ornn don't give a fuck LUL
[3:53:33] AudioPool: looks like he already free farming
[3:53:34] malavrana: in that case it might be better you let him push towards your tower not pushing your lane
[3:53:39] garry_leonard: He's already free farming

[3:55:48] Deathspate: yes, worth as fuck
[3:55:49] Shoaron: you and your team are a little tankier now

[3:58:04] JimB0b0: This warwick is forcing way too hard
[3:58:14] filarette: whats the biggest lol change last 2 years? completely out of loop
[3:58:16] AinzN: Bonye_West this is the League lowfi beats stuff I think
[3:58:26] Marshtomp1662: They changed all the items

[3:58:51] VanityOfViolet: there are a few new items this preseason tho
[3:59:05] AinzN: Bonye_West I think there are two playlists on the League/Riot website but not sure which one this is
[3:59:06] Deathspate: 6 new items iirc
[3:59:06] VanityOfViolet: two new drakes, objective bounties this preseason
[3:59:10] FieryOctane: Do we know when next season starts?
[3:59:27] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour.

[4:00:32] FieryOctane: @Deathspate What's Project L?
[4:00:42] AinzN: FieryOctane the League fighting game
[4:00:53] Deathspate: @FieryOctane League fighting game by the co-founders of EVO and founder of GGPO
[4:01:11] FieryOctane: Oh right, I'm terrible at fighting games so if anything I'm more stoked for the MMO.
[4:01:19] Voidcrow_92: Anyone here played Ruined King? It was pretty good ^^
[4:01:26] JimB0b0: 35 kills
[4:01:34] Deathspate: @FieryOctane more news on the MMO is to come in 2022 from what GhostCrawler said
[4:01:36] Djoze64: a sexier, redhead yasuo, what's not to like
[4:01:52] GGam3r: people always believe in comebacks 4Head
[4:02:30] FieryOctane: @Deathspate I'd hope so! Interested to see if it's going to be tab targetting or action type.
[4:02:59] DrewGamer: @GGam3r To be fair, if there were ever a season to believe in comebacks, this is the one with all the catchup mechanics.

[4:08:48] AinzN: So I hope you lot have been good this year so you get lots of presents! ijpHERO
[4:09:32] Omakie: ive been terrible but tried to be good does that count
[4:09:50] EthicaTank: is ssurrendering in LoL a bad thing? i play r6 siege and if you surrender its tracked and you can see how many times a person bails and it isnt a good thing to do
[4:10:05] DrewGamer: presents feel weird for me now. As a kid it was one of the coolest feelings in the world, because I could never afford anything myself. I had to wait until Christmas/Birthday.
[4:10:15] AinzN: Omakie sure
[4:10:58] AinzN: DrewGamer you mean you don't wait all year to get the underwear and sock combo present?
[4:11:22] DrewGamer: @EthicaTank Its not tracked in LoL. Surrendering looks like any other loss. So when a team is getting stomped it makes sense to move on to the next one.
[4:11:23] Omakie: wihtout christmas id never have no socks
[4:11:37] EthicaTank: gotcha ty
[4:11:46] DrewGamer: @AinzN Actually I don't think I've gotten that combo in ages cohhLUL
[4:11:50] heisenbergerhelper: Hey Jp and chat im off to do Christmas things tonight so everyone have a safe and happy Christmas eve and ill see you tomorrow. Thanks for the entertainment Jp cohhL cohhL
[4:11:54] AinzN: Once you get to your late 20's socks and underwear for Xmas is the best thing ever!
[4:12:17] AinzN: heisenbergerhelper have fun bud!
[4:12:25] Reijm11: Disagree, I hate getting clothes of any kind from other people
[4:12:32] DrewGamer: @heisenbergerhelper Hope its a good one cohhL ijpLOVE
[4:12:40] Reijm11: makes me not want to wear it
[4:13:34] AinzN: There is jsut something different about getting socks compared to getting a shirt or a jacket
[4:13:43] Reijm11: I would rather get a new plant or something
[4:14:27] Reijm11: I know what socks I like and always make sure I have the right ones already anyway
[4:14:28] AinzN: I'm just glad my family stopped with the shitty deodorant/body wash combo gift
[4:15:12] Reijm11: true got many of those sample brand packages with all the different soaps and stuff in my teen years

[4:23:35] Jukettaja: It really is the top lane mantra
[4:23:45] LegendsOfBobby: roam better then him
[4:23:47] Jukettaja: If you play any melee you go against ranged poke that ruins everything
[4:23:51] DrewGamer: Top = the lane of counterpicks :(
[4:23:52] Sonatta: i see a lot of people playing Tarkov
[4:23:55] ワフルデラ: no idea I think FPS are dead atm
[4:23:56] GraveSalad: It seems split between Apex, Halo, and Tark
[4:24:04] Ken_Taru: as long as you aren't playing Big Team Battle halo matches are quick and fun. BTB is still broken
[4:24:08] Nucleak: Why
[4:24:22] Eplesh: valorant hast the most viewers right now
[4:24:33] Dredstryde: passive and ACTIVE - gives you a shield
[4:24:42] Theawesomesoccer2: when you have 3 stacks you can eat enemies
[4:24:42] JimB0b0: Ult is for saving friends or killing fully stacked people
[4:24:43] Benrik2010: Ult is the eat
[4:24:46] Lcnt: ult = stripYum
[4:24:49] slycefyre: is the ult the thing that lets you eat people?
[4:24:56] slycefyre: ok it is
[4:24:58] Theawesomesoccer2: get stacks by q and atuos
[4:24:59] jclester: Can eat people and spit them out
[4:25:03] LegendsOfBobby: he should solo shickens
[4:25:05] LegendsOfBobby: chickens*
[4:25:16] ワフルデラ: KEKW
[4:25:17] JeXus1985: hit the enemy 3 times so they have that debuff on them, then you can eat
[4:25:23] AinzN: ijpKEK
[4:25:24] Jukettaja: lol
[4:25:24] Lcnt: Clap
[4:25:28] Benrik2010: Its over
[4:25:31] garry_leonard: your E gets bigger the more you get hurt. YOu want to use it when you are low in a fight to get a big shield
[4:25:36] Dredstryde: @LegendsOfBobby No he shouldnt - if hes going for a full clear that slows him down by 7 seconds and makes him miss crab contest
[4:25:38] CDubTheRIPper: Pog
[4:25:45] CDubTheRIPper: PauseChamp
[4:25:51] Jukettaja: But.. he's a catfish
[4:26:18] Benrik2010: Use q to lasthit
[4:26:27] FiraVII: technically you don't want to use your shield if you don't need to since you'll regen the grey health
[4:26:33] AinzN: Lick all the things! peepoShy
[4:26:34] Theawesomesoccer2: with ult at 3 stacks
[4:26:58] VanityOfViolet: I got really confused and thought he was gnar lmao
[4:27:10] garry_leonard: You can use your Q to CS against bullies
[4:27:20] AinzN: Wait is Gnar a 2 character champion?
[4:27:39] Theawesomesoccer2: yes
[4:27:41] JimB0b0: You want  to w on to people or save it to escape
[4:27:45] Dredstryde: @AinzN he has a transformation yes
[4:27:50] Theawesomesoccer2: when the bottom bar fills up he goes mega
[4:28:04] AinzN: Is the transformation the big bear thing?
[4:28:12] FiraVII: yea
[4:28:28] JeXus1985: whenever Gnar's bar fills up, he will automatically transform within a couple seconds
[4:28:30] Theawesomesoccer2: oh shit kayne ganking
[4:28:53] FiraVII: if you can time fights well you can make Gnar waste his rage mode

[4:30:26] JeXus1985: Q or autoattack
[4:30:26] Rezz284: not Q
[4:30:27] AinzN: That was close!

[4:30:38] Baelgyr: Good job so far JP!
[4:30:51] FiraVII: 3 stacks and a Q will also sound which can be more useful
[4:30:54] JeXus1985: also dont underestimate how fast that W is

[4:34:32] DanXaliberc: Yeah all the coal ijpKEK
[4:35:06] AinzN: Hope they step on the LEGO piece they drop from their present tomorrow!
[4:35:08] Drolheim: @Damarus914 cheers man. Yeah the jung looks like it is completely different and the map layout has changed.
[4:35:30] afreak10: yikes
[4:36:15] AinzN: I think once you get teh hang of Tahm and feel more comfortable on him he will be good
[4:36:22] JimB0b0: Yeah
[4:36:29] FluentZap: Yep, and he has great sustain
[4:36:35] JimB0b0: And his W is a real good aoe engage
[4:36:50] Benrik2010: He becomes tanky, and he does good aa dmg
[4:36:52] FiraVII: becoming unkillable on tahm is quite enjoyable
[4:36:55] Eplesh: lmao

[4:37:33] Eplesh: I bet someone has that tattooed onto them
[4:38:01] Benrik2010: You can eat minions and monsters from afar if you ult the moment your q hits the minion @itmeJP
[4:38:10] AinzN: OhTenGeneral yeah JP has been trying to learn Top Lane. This is his first game of Tahm. Normally plays Teemo
[4:38:15] TDotTerror: Is only game.
[4:38:17] AinzN: gachiBASS
[4:38:20] TDotTerror: Why they heff to be mad?
[4:38:28] OhTenGeneral: Oh I love me some Teemo
[4:38:44] Benrik2010: Kills? Pog
[4:38:47] OhTenGeneral: I wish I liked playing Mr. 2 Health Bars more though
[4:39:30] OhTenGeneral: Yeah Gnar can absolutely lock you down for like 5 seconds
[4:39:45] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[4:39:59] AinzN: Jammies

[4:40:22] AinzN: I feel like they sped up the Jammies emote. I swear it was slightly slower
[4:40:30] Damarus914: @itmeJP Do you still have that catfish helm from FF? Should come in handy if you play Tahm a lot
[4:40:32] OhTenGeneral: Not necessarily true but Tahm is pretty efficient

[4:40:58] AinzN: Damarus914 he does I think it's in the guest room or something
[4:41:16] AinzN: Eplesh this is the League Lowfi Beats from the LEague/Riot website I believe
[4:41:31] Eplesh: thanks!
[4:41:42] AinzN: There are two playlists not sure which one this is though
[4:41:59] BobbiTheDragon: merry christmas chat and jp
[4:42:02] Eplesh: Ill listen to both if they have lofi vibes
[4:42:30] OhTenGeneral: Have you tried Nasus at all yet? He's one of my favorites and pretty simple to pick up
[4:42:31] AinzN: Same to you as well bobbithedragon ijpH
[4:42:53] OhTenGeneral: Nothing like a good THWAP
[4:43:04] Ribbons_Almark: did we unbench the Kench yet?
[4:43:08] OhTenGeneral: You need the whole fish (3 stacks)
[4:43:14] bulletsponge55: no
[4:43:30] AinzN: Ribbons_Almark still learning
[4:43:46] bulletsponge55: i think nunu was too fat for you click on gnar to eat lol
[4:43:57] crawds: was that support?
[4:43:58] OhTenGeneral: Gnar is a miserable matchup for Tahm
[4:43:58] Ribbons_Almark: @ainzn got it, wasnt sure if I missed a lot of Kench yet OSFrog
[4:44:10] AinzN: Ribbons_Almark this was the first game of Tahm
[4:44:23] AinzN: Was learning Teemo earlier
[4:44:53] JeXus1985: yeah, first picking top sucks
[4:44:54] gnarre: I'm sorry
[4:44:57] OhTenGeneral: There are some very polarizing matchups yeah. Probably the most of any lane
[4:45:06] AinzN: And the counters always seem to be against the Champs you like ijpSAD
[4:45:16] Nied80: how is Kog'maw theses days in game?
[4:45:20] OhTenGeneral: And if it's not a counter, it's some Irelia or Fiora bullshit
[4:45:34] OhTenGeneral: He's an ADC without mobility so pretty bad
[4:45:38] bulletsponge55: I don't think kog is really in the meta
[4:45:45] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[4:45:48] Drolheim: @itmeJP and chat, So having not played LoL in 7 years, how does the game feel with so many champs?
[4:45:49] JeXus1985: tryndamere
[4:45:50] OhTenGeneral: When in doubt hit Y and pick any of them
[4:45:52] Nied80: ouch...
[4:46:12] Baske_T: did JP try porofessor yet or still using blitz?
[4:46:18] OhTenGeneral: Yasuo, Yone, Yi, udYr, trYndemere
[4:46:19] Fish_Whisperer: The client has always sucked since the game launched lol
[4:46:20] AinzN: Still using Blitz
[4:46:23] Eplesh: Dude 20th anniversary will be client chance day, mark my words Pog
[4:46:33] Eplesh: change*
[4:46:45] bulletsponge55: it's invasive as shit too
[4:46:55] bulletsponge55: i think i might go back to just blitz
[4:46:56] OhTenGeneral: This was year 11
[4:47:08] Hawnk: i preffer mobalytics for that exact reason
[4:47:11] Eplesh: yeah they annonced all the games like valorant, project L, and lots of changes to the game
[4:47:18] OhTenGeneral: I started playing fall 2010
[4:47:26] OhTenGeneral: I think it was in beta for part of 2009 though?
[4:47:47] JeXus1985: at the very least it's two melee champs, so you're much better off
[4:47:50] Cronopolis: Unclog The Frog OSFrog
[4:47:50] AutumnReds: if you're good her life is hard
[4:47:56] OhTenGeneral: Riven is almost an entirely skill-based matchup. Good Rivens basically beat anyone

[4:51:51] OhTenGeneral: Her Q is a 3 skill combo too so she can get 5 empowered autos
[4:51:56] Damarus914: Gotta say it's real hard to come up with a catfish pun. Keep on doing the frog puns chat
[4:52:15] ladderoat: base and tp back

[4:52:45] Theawesomesoccer2: as late as possible
[4:52:50] OhTenGeneral: ALMOST got the tower trade
[4:52:54] urbanedensity: Need to use tp
[4:52:55] Benrik2010: Use E if she commits too hard
[4:52:57] Stabaccus: It converts gray health to shield, you have to have taken damage first
[4:53:03] garry_leonard: NO E sucks until yyou've taken alot of damage
[4:53:06] JeXus1985: when you get hit, your life gets converted to grey life. If you do nothing you will regen it back. if you press e, that grey lif ebecomes a shield
[4:53:07] Benrik2010: E shield scales with grey hp
[4:53:12] Greywind424: the dmg you take builds up grey hp when you push e you get a shield for as much grey hp
[4:53:15] garry_leonard: E gets bigger the more damage you've taken recently. You can see it on your health bar
[4:53:24] AinzN: Damarus914 the only one I can think of is "Undish the Catfish!" but doesn't make sense
[4:53:32] OhTenGeneral: But yeah she's gonna aggro you constantly. It's mostly a last-resort kind of thing because if you don't use it you will regen a good portion of it as regular health

[4:53:49] OhTenGeneral: If Tahm Kench feeds he's gonna be a Po Boy
[4:53:49] garry_leonard: Rivens goal will be to use her Q combo on you 2 or 3 times and run away between, before coming in to finish
[4:53:50] urbanedensity: It’s the grey hp
[4:54:03] garry_leonard: youre goal is to just keep licker her all in one go
[4:54:20] OhTenGeneral: Your W is basically unusable as an escape yeah
[4:54:27] LGNDRYNRG: can tahm not eat anymore?
[4:54:32] JimB0b0: And you can go in with your W
[4:54:39] OhTenGeneral: @lgndryrng It's the ult now

[4:54:49] LGNDRYNRG: oh what the heck

[5:35:42] LGNDRYNRG: there's a dfagon??
[5:35:42] Lcnt: didn't read the books and don't enjoy the show :)
[5:35:45] Shrimp_Parm: lol
[5:35:45] ワフルデラ: it's like responding to a MCU tweet with "But have you read the comics" KEKW
[5:35:47] Bigmamachunk: Oh god the women can't arguments
[5:35:48] DerfOnTurf: Everyone seems to like the show except for the book readers yeah
[5:35:51] RlDennis: Oh no
[5:35:56] Bigmamachunk: Why are those everywhere all the time
[5:35:56] afreak10: witcher season 2 had this too
[5:35:59] RlDennis: She does LUL
[5:36:00] Nogardknight: imagine an adaptation for a different medium being different from source material of another medium
[5:36:02] Nogardknight: WILD
[5:36:08] Eplesh: % Damage is going to hurt
[5:36:10] titanodin: lol i forget fiora is a champ
[5:36:20] Noytron: I think you can just hug a wall and she can't hit 1 of the 4 vitals
[5:36:25] Athleon: I used to play Fiora in my bried toplane days
[5:36:32] Athleon: brief*
[5:36:33] Saryuken: Tahm Kench is counter to pretty much everything
[5:36:34] MTVaughn: I think it is cool just to see the visual adaptation
[5:36:35] holycaliburn: its 50/50 with fiora
[5:36:39] ワフルデラ: I think you can play around Fiora a fair bit
[5:36:42] LGNDRYNRG: idk about counter, but that riven was not the best
[5:36:44] sunflower204: to be fair the fact that women can also be the dragon breaks a lot of things in the story later on.
[5:36:50] ShadowsparksTV: Tahm is just a pretty reliable top in general. He's pretty strong.
[5:36:50] holycaliburn: ayyyy
[5:36:53] Noytron: tahm is just solid all around xD
[5:37:00] tyree_sanada: 100 IS fIORA
[5:37:04] Daruvik: non-tank melees generally have a hard time against Tahm
[5:37:04] ワフルデラ: if you can not have your q parried and slow her when she goes all in so she can't get her passives off you'll be fine

[5:37:13] titanodin: arcane one is pretty dope
[5:37:25] titanodin: not memeing about the show either
[5:37:29] Cardsharp: Hey Jp and Chat!  Hope everyone is having a Merry Christmas Eve
[5:37:29] RlDennis: @itmeJP fiora ult places 4 marks on you that she wants to hit. Each deals % max hp damage, heals her and once she's hit all 4 she spawns a healing field. Hugging a wall can prevent her from reaching one of those marks ijpONEGUY
[5:37:32] LGNDRYNRG: tahm has an arcane skin??
[5:37:44] Eplesh: Arcana not arcane
