[1:04:21] ziosevielspezel: vex?
[1:04:44] Sylvanas_Windrunner1: lost to RW KEKW
[1:04:48] yutapon_cubes: Bin Copium
[1:04:53] longkazama: @ryanchen879 why not? they were pretty much on par with the same level as the world champion. bin is one of the best tops and xaiohu was mid in the past
[1:05:04] Kun2_: @praetorian_N u lost to trowhnatic KEKW
[1:05:05] catopes: @vexkinacute evidently, u dont need knight to win lpl
[1:05:13] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: xiaohu top >>>>>> xiaohu mid
[1:05:23] Hirakai: can u bet on this
[1:05:34] vexkinacute: u need a top tier mid @catopes
[1:05:48] autumnrainbells: @Hirakai betting addiction right here
[1:05:53] catopes: and xiaohu is one
[1:05:59] longkazama: @vexkinacute xiaohu is a top tier top and he played mid in the past so u can imagine he is no pushover
[1:06:05] catopes: always was
[1:06:09] NigrumFalcon: xiaohu's lucian in top is one my favourite to watch

[1:07:33] Seventh_Sky: 3 am every night monkaS
[1:07:46] autumnrainbells: xiaohu mid in the past wasn't that great, cause they gave all resource to Uzi
[1:07:48] vexkinacute: @dancing_with_death he was the best top laner so if u have the best top and the best mid your chances are a lot higher
[1:07:51] longkazama: @dancing_with_death just curious what about others? edg and lng?

[1:08:38] duochainz: everyone has hsv in LPL lol
[1:08:46] autumnrainbells: @NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING is Iwandy still in lineup?
[1:08:49] ziosevielspezel: @ryanchen879  i think tes and lng can be top 3 idk about edg since they won worlds and their motivation to win again
[1:08:59] mikro45l: @Kun2_ you should take a breath fellow gamer, you are here just insulting everyone
[1:08:59] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @autumnrainbells yup

[1:09:53] autumnrainbells: @NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING why arent they starting him, lvmao trash
[1:09:58] edgesworth: why didn't they play iwandy during demacia cup?

[1:10:22] vexkinacute: it doesn t matter they wanted to try out lvmao
[1:10:28] Kun2_: LUL mao
[1:10:43] ziosevielspezel: @ryanchen879  if they bench tian they have a pretty good chance
[1:10:49] autumnrainbells: @dancing_with_death ahh, gotcha
[1:10:52] duochainz: they dont got valtrex in china???
[1:10:54] Kun2_: Knight really hate 369 LUL
[1:11:07] vexkinacute: tian looked good in these games
[1:11:15] longkazama: @dancing_with_death KEKW I forgot tian went there. lol I thought his health is complete shit
[1:11:16] NigrumFalcon: "hold that ramp" damn imagine his wrists

[1:12:18] Kun2_: LNGap KEKW
[1:12:19] autumnrainbells: @Kun2_ 369 refused to play some champs or something
[1:12:31] lwowlnrlwowl: GOOOD
[1:12:32] ziosevielspezel: @autumnrainbells  did you watch demacia cup he was running it down all games
[1:12:43] longkazama: @mikro45l chill bro no one is screaming insults in their face this is not even a chinese forum
[1:12:47] austinzangg: lng mikuya KEKW
[1:13:06] autumnrainbells: @dancing_with_death I meant scrims he was good, didnt say he was good on stage
[1:13:18] Kun2_: the problem of 369 is the same as lwx is an ego player does not accept his mistakes and blames others
[1:13:54] Kiyo_Ereeh: ohhh
[1:13:54] longkazama: @dancing_with_death isn't the main issue his health? it has been going on for a year now and didn't seem to be better last time he appeared
[1:14:23] ziosevielspezel: @ryanchen879  he also has wrist issues idk why he just take a break
