[0:57:12] jlhgameart: !tierlist
[0:57:15] GraveSalad: @WDForty they'd only care if they were making them a contract. Otherwise Content ID does their work for them
[0:57:16] Pseudocrat: There's a weird curve here because if you graphed old content vs average age of twitch user -- many of those users probably haven't seen older content due to how old they were when it first aired. So at that point it may be new content
[0:57:31] AinzN: Is Darkaros back form his shower yet?
[0:57:33] Imbadyoureworse: Can we watch season 2 of master chef after that?
[0:57:38] cameowla: @itmeJP do you have any list of recommendations for steam sales? I need to burn some xmas money

[1:43:38] EvilEden: Mundo stonks have risen once again
[1:43:40] CadaverLuke: Kench is better in duo cuz u can make ulti plays.

[1:43:59] Theawesomesoccer2: mundo can jungle
[1:43:59] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: I honestly feel like both of them you just ignore in fights, (WHEN you are against them)
[1:44:03] LGNDRYNRG: you got auto filled
[1:44:03] Radcosh: Mundo jungle works though
[1:44:03] Theawesomesoccer2: autofill
[1:44:04] Boonia: filled
[1:44:05] LazyNekos: autofill
[1:44:06] jebjealous: Auto fill
[1:44:08] CamberCYM: Hey how well does that spatial audio for FFXIV work?
[1:44:09] Ahoy_NATO: auto fill and jungle is the least popular role rn
[1:44:13] Dasutin23: punishment for the rage last night
[1:44:14] Swiftfool: Mid and top are high prio lanes so u get autofilled more
[1:44:14] ReginaldXIV: That's when you play Vi or Hecarim and hard carry
[1:44:21] holycaliburn: in store it shows what abbilities to level
[1:44:24] TehMud: How goes it today? Personally I'm having fun with sleep deprivation.
[1:44:26] TPLivewire: You can't just jump into Jungle though chat. Mundo might be a jungle but JP doesn't jungle.
[1:44:30] CamberCYM: Oof :(
[1:44:32] Sonatta: seems like a scam
[1:44:38] InternetPlumber: it fucked up my audio.. I had to play in dx9 mode

[1:45:20] GGuts: Looking for a salt mine around here. Is this the place? danHmm
[1:45:23] zynessa: @TehMud that'd be unfair to actual league players, he'd crush them too hard
[1:45:29] Daruvik: JP had said he liked the audio from the Spacial Audio thing, but Chat was Pepega and couldn't get over it sounding DiFfErEnT
[1:45:29] Ahoy_NATO: ornn is really fun and impactful
[1:45:36] CadaverLuke: try kled top. amazing champ

[1:46:02] ReginaldXIV: To be fair, the game didn't use the pictures of chat's ears
[1:46:07] AinzN: JimWho ijpH

[1:56:10] TehMud: Strippin is plotting.
[1:56:10] RoboticBiotic777: @itmeJP Would you recommend the new Ratchet & Clank game? My birthday is coming up and I was thinking about asking for it from one of my brothers.
[1:56:16] ReginaldXIV: He's starting stream
[1:56:40] Swiftfool: Strippin just went live
[1:56:40] RoboticBiotic777: I watched some of your playthrough and you seemed to enjoy it alot.
[1:57:05] RoboticBiotic777: Oh awesome, thanks. I think I'll get it then!
[1:57:11] kingg3d: man i wish i had a ps5 to play the new R&C game
[1:57:44] LGNDRYNRG: shouldn't mundo be Q-E-W then max q?
[1:57:49] freka_man: op.gg shows u what to take
[1:57:52] freka_man: and where to max
[1:57:52] Price_FTW: blitz does that by default?
[1:57:55] ReginaldXIV: Oh I dunno, I have that stuff turned off even when I used Blitz
[1:58:08] afreak10: KEKLEO
[1:58:10] ReginaldXIV: Fight

[1:58:29] ReginaldXIV: What does Strippin use?
[1:58:29] Madracah: No Sam?
[1:58:31] holycaliburn: in the store, itll show what abilities to use
[1:58:38] Daruvik: porofessor is a great name
[1:58:39] Joebeezer: Mundo gonna need you to come in  on Saturday
[1:58:40] Omakie: sam uses porofessor
[1:58:46] Swiftfool: U.gg is the best for website, porofessor has the best app tho
[1:58:51] Doctor_Von_Decency: @itmeJP ive used them all and porofessor is the bst imo. it hs the overlays and an easy tool to show which abilities to level
[1:58:54] AinzN: Madracah he is currently starting up his stream so might need another 20 minutes
[1:59:00] ReginaldXIV: I like the in-game UI for Porofessor, but everything else in u.gg
[1:59:09] enricofairme: Mundo POGGERS
[1:59:11] Omakie: thats fair regi
[1:59:16] LGNDRYNRG: now i kinda hope you lose cuz that rengar is a dickhead
[1:59:25] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[1:59:36] Victo0: I mean, he plays rengar, of course he's going to be toxic
[1:59:42] Lobonidas: all rengar players are toxic
[1:59:47] Jukettaja: Oh sweet Mundo
[1:59:54] Jukettaja: I really like the remake they did
[1:59:55] Stabaccus: How is he being toxic...he was being the opposite of toxic
[2:00:05] Joebeezer: I hope you win a 80 minute game because that Rengar is a dickhead
[2:00:10] Stabaccus: He told the guy to play whatever he wanted
[2:00:11] Omakie: yeah looks like qew then max q
[2:00:15] Strippin: This guy couldnt wait for my preshow smh i hope you get a 0/4 midlaner

[2:04:15] Victo0: @thunderhatter neither, maybe with lethal tempo but I don't really think so
[2:04:30] javybavy: surprising blitz doesnt say to rush ninja tabs vs tryn. Those are huge vs auto attackers
[2:04:51] Boonia: does tryn have ignite?
[2:05:06] vKawaiix: you have to  select your matchup for blitz
[2:05:15] Theawesomesoccer2: oh deer lillia taking ove the game

[2:05:57] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[2:05:59] FredIsBread: its sort of an all or nothing situation
[2:05:59] Victo0: mundo have to respect a lot until lvl 8-9, he's really weak before that, and trynd has a big power spike that early too
[2:06:02] IllusionistTrixie: Trynd is my 100% ban as top lane. I don't know how to fight him, I don't want to learn
[2:06:04] Jukettaja: Mostly just down to kiting him with cleaver
[2:06:04] vKawaiix: build a bramble vest and then cry when he still kills you
[2:06:09] Skyhawk3r: Business Mundo is a great skin though so
[2:06:10] Swiftfool: Fight him when he uses his rage for Q after he misses his spin, also poke him down
[2:06:15] Garbwire: okay, so i see Sam, Gmart and ALN (aka Cerndor) online for LoL now, we looking at a fun time team up maybe? coxBaeloy coxManleee
[2:06:18] Tanho51: @ThatGunsFoHire no freaking way man POGGERS
[2:06:21] javybavy: like right now vs the lead tryn has
[2:06:26] Deathspate: If you want the real answer, you don't fight him, it's a waste of time and costs you more than it's worth
[2:06:26] RevenantKitsune: I would offer suggestions but I'm so out dated on my knowledge with League
[2:06:42] afreak10: he also had jungle help him
[2:06:47] ThatGunsFoHire: @ThatGunsFoHire Thank you LUL
[2:06:50] birkhoms: against tryn, you need a f amount of CC to tie him down in order to wait the ulti out
[2:06:59] vKawaiix: my 100% ban is morgana.. i xan never dodge her q, even if she misses it somehow still hits me
[2:07:02] Theawesomesoccer2: prob was mashing buttons in the 1v1
[2:07:10] afreak10: wow
[2:07:12] The_zuriel: think he missclicked the ward instead of his pot, he placed it in the 1v1
[2:07:13] FredIsBread: oh no
[2:07:15] Theawesomesoccer2: oh nvm
[2:07:15] 0GHammer: 3? LUL
[2:07:17] Deathevan: @IllusionistTrixie I also hated him back when I played, but back then there weren't as many champions with easy escapes/gap closers to counter him
[2:07:18] afreak10: 3 ppl gank
[2:07:18] Tanho51: we got him EZ

[2:08:31] GraveSalad: that's insulting to fetuses
[2:08:44] Tanho51: corki Crungo
[2:08:54] DanForSure: In LoL can you play in a party with friends?
[2:08:59] Omakie: yep
[2:09:01] IllusionistTrixie: time to sit at turret and freeze for 15 minutes :(
[2:09:02] LGNDRYNRG: @DanForSure yes
[2:09:11] STNbond: that one guy set the mood for this game in the pick/ban
[2:09:18] javybavy: @DanForSure yeah you can play with a full party of 5, but ranked you can only solo or duo
[2:09:19] Omakie: lol best friendship ender 2021
[2:09:21] VicktoriousVICK: good CSing Pog
[2:09:24] DanForSure: ijpCHEER
[2:09:30] Deathspate: @itmeJP a word of advice whenever you're against lanes like Trynd and other champs that rely on auto attacks, rush ninja tabis first item as the unique passive helps a lot against those champs, 12% reduced auto attack damage iirc
[2:09:34] LGNDRYNRG: i guess i get what i wanted since that rengar is holding a fat L

[2:10:14] JimWho: Stuffed crust ijpH
[2:10:15] Omakie: @TehMud just some olive and mushroom thin crust
[2:10:22] Swiftfool: Pineapple please :)
[2:10:34] LGNDRYNRG: @Deathspate fun fact, "ninja tabi" isnt a thing anymore BibleThump
[2:10:34] enricofairme: monkaS
[2:10:51] TehMud: @Swiftfool Already done. Yup I like pineapple on pizza
[2:10:53] Deathspate: @lgndryrng well whatever it's called now lmao, I still call control wards pinks
[2:10:56] IllusionistTrixie: I can't play with team chat on, don't need the abuse when not winning by 10 kills
[2:11:14] afreak10: he's behind u
[2:11:16] LGNDRYNRG: @Deathspate im just messing haha, and yes i feel you on the old names lol
[2:11:26] AN71V1RU5: tbf, at this point your lane is very behind because there team played better. but best for knife cat to write it off and influence elsewhere
[2:11:29] Tanho51: down with league players 🔫
[2:11:38] DanForSure: @lgndryrng oh no he isn't!
[2:11:39] TehMud: Alright got one pepperoni, one olive and mushroom with thin crust, and one pineapple pizza. You gotta share though.
[2:11:44] VicktoriousVICK: this is easily winnable
[2:11:46] ReginaldXIV: I kill League chat by being overly nice
[2:11:47] afreak10: this team //
[2:11:48] afreak10: ..
[2:11:50] ReginaldXIV: Disarms them

[2:11:51] Omakie: thanks mr mud
[2:11:51] enricofairme: Noooo KEKW
[2:11:59] Price_FTW: Veigar should have just put the stun on him why around him?? lmao
[2:12:12] Swiftfool: I just carry every game to not get flamed by my teammates :) In essence just play better Kappa
[2:12:33] IllusionistTrixie: its much harder to stun directly with the cage as it has an arming time, so trynd can spin out of it then
[2:12:34] debajr: Veigar could just Q+R him to test for reflex on Tryndas R LUL
[2:12:40] LGNDRYNRG: i thought it was his 1st time veig? he prolly doesnt know about how to drop stun
[2:12:51] Deathspate: @Price_FTW A lot of people play with quickcast, when you do that and don't know the ranges properly, that usually happens
[2:13:22] ReginaldXIV: I think overall you win just by having Veigar and Morg on the same team
[2:13:23] Pentacookies: jp hAS A NICE CHUNK OF CHANGE ><

[2:15:50] ワフルデラ: I played once back in the day with a duo premade and one of them was so toxic the other had to apologize for him KEKW
[2:15:54] TehMud: Turns out it was actually Neville cursing the game all along.
[2:16:01] LGNDRYNRG: @slydown he's level 50 something, and i think this is ranked
[2:16:05] DagooX: isn't league a single player game? Kappa
[2:16:11] Swiftfool: Oh man first game in and the salt mine already flowing
[2:16:13] oRiie: 2-3 people near tower; no minions next to tower; your at 35% health, don't really think it's a good idea there, push minions first team had the right idea

[2:18:46] Barba06: @ワフルデラ No they don't, macros don't work well with ninjutsus :D
[2:18:49] TehMud: IN my League experience you need to hit the thing with the guy and hit the buttons so the other stuff happens.
[2:18:55] WitchyMatty: @ワフルデラ no because there is a slight delay with the macro and it is faster to use yourself
[2:18:55] Swiftfool: Chat are all world champions
[2:18:57] ThatGunsFoHire: @DarkSylver Uh.. what?

[2:19:35] The_zuriel: @lgndryrng MmmHmm
[2:19:46] ThatGunsFoHire: That's the equivalent of not getting a job because you need experience at the job
[2:19:49] TehMud: My uncle works for Nintendo I totally understand League
[2:19:55] RoboticBiotic777: League streams are a gamble imho. Sometimes chat is chill, sometimes they get real triggered. At least in my experience.
[2:20:15] Pentacookies: dont hate mundo chat mundo has checks to cash kaypWinner
[2:20:16] RoboticBiotic777: Experience watching* I should say. I don't stream. lol

[2:23:21] Theagent203: yes jungler came top very early
[2:23:31] ReginaldXIV: Kai'sa seems farmed, so it might end up being fine
[2:23:45] Barba06: you said he's dead so he died
[2:23:51] Swiftfool: Its winnable tbh if this kaisa can carry u guys have a good comp
[2:24:04] IllusionistTrixie: waiting for Kaisa to press R to die into that team
[2:24:09] afreak10: not with that team
[2:24:24] IllusionistTrixie: i love this mundo skin frankly
[2:24:25] Mortumee: they have nothing to answer trynda splitpushing tho
[2:24:43] Swiftfool: Just stall out the game, let kaisa get 3-4 items, veigar stack qs
[2:24:48] JohnyRallo: rengar is such a bad pick
[2:24:58] Swiftfool: play defensive and peel for veigar kaisa tbh
[2:25:09] afreak10: he let u die

[2:27:48] IllusionistTrixie: isn't that an ingame option? i'm sure I have timers without an app
[2:27:54] LGNDRYNRG: @ReginaldXIV did he say that you were the one who recommended the app to him?
[2:28:04] IllusionistTrixie: or maybe I installed one and forgot :P
[2:28:18] LGNDRYNRG: @IllusionistTrixie no there isn't an in game option for that
[2:28:25] The_zuriel: The only thing the game does by default is the camp turning white/yellow before it spawns
[2:28:26] The_zuriel: no timers

[2:34:47] LGNDRYNRG: how is tryn no just pushing their base?
[2:34:52] Joebeezer: top lane

[2:37:45] Swiftfool: it makes it so kaisa takes ess dmg and transfers dmg to you
[2:37:46] Joebeezer: knights vow would be solid in protecting kaisa
[2:38:04] IllusionistTrixie: you take some %damage for them
[2:38:05] The_zuriel: Basically transfers some of the damage kaisa takes to you as long as your close to her
[2:38:13] CDubTheRIPper: catJAM
[2:38:24] DrYaguar: F
[2:38:24] afreak10: F
[2:38:24] LGNDRYNRG: gg
[2:38:25] IllusionistTrixie: oof that might be it
[2:38:31] Swiftfool: thats gg
[2:38:32] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[2:38:41] IllusionistTrixie: go rengar save us!
[2:38:44] Ekoki: i am sorry for saying " i like this morgana"
[2:38:52] Jukettaja: Apology accepted
[2:38:53] Victo0: why would morg stay in that bush if they already tried to hit her in there once, she knew she was seen
[2:38:59] The_zuriel: This is honestly worse than just losing 20mins ago. cause now u almost brought it back its just sadge
[2:39:06] qOqpOp_poe: engaging when the inhib is pushing their base was stupid
[2:39:13] Joebeezer: questionmark ping him
[2:39:16] Joebeezer: I would LUL
[2:39:21] mayosilog: a chance?
[2:39:30] Price_FTW: oregano just not on his game for this one
[2:39:31] Marc326: after the start, I thought it'd go even worse, so it wasn't THAT bad, I think lobosShrug
[2:39:34] Jukettaja: I wouldn't get into the habit of question mark pinging people
[2:39:42] Jukettaja: It never helps.
[2:39:50] IllusionistTrixie: yeah but it makes you feel better :P
[2:39:52] Joebeezer: It's impressive that veigar is not lvl 18
[2:40:00] soDugger: it's 40 min and veigar is 17
[2:40:09] LivingTarget: tp in the base if they 5 man baron
[2:40:09] Jukettaja: Just need a good Veigar ult combo
[2:40:31] afreak10: u will die
[2:41:00] IllusionistTrixie: lol did lilia not R before zhona?
[2:41:20] Swiftfool: @IllusionistTrixie she didnt have it
[2:41:22] Brostya: @IllusionistTrixie she did already before the Q
[2:41:31] LGNDRYNRG: @IllusionistTrixie she used it earlier in the fight
[2:41:34] IllusionistTrixie: ah, it looked like it would have been a god tier ult
[2:41:37] Joebeezer: trap them in instead of always going for the stun yeah
[2:41:40] afreak10: F
[2:41:52] afreak10: rengar lost the game
[2:41:57] LGNDRYNRG: LOL
[2:41:59] Jukettaja: Oh well you did get to a stage where a few team fight wins would have turned the tide so it's not too bad.
[2:42:01] DagooX: KEKW
[2:42:02] Swiftfool: veigar kept using it prematurely
[2:42:07] Kymix: He did shotcall the loss KEKW
[2:42:16] zynessa: @Swiftfool common problem for young men
[2:42:16] mayosilog: what, what does debonair event do?
[2:42:23] Victo0: that's why I just like to play malphite when I have to tryhard top, lane is pretty much always fine and his ult allows to win teamfights even from behind
[2:42:24] CDubTheRIPper: catJAM GuitarTime
[2:42:27] LGNDRYNRG: @mayo_on_rice yay new debonair skins
[2:42:30] Jukettaja: It's just a bunch of debonair skins
[2:42:35] ReginaldXIV: lol
[2:42:39] LGNDRYNRG: its zed and someone else
[2:42:42] Kymix: @mayo_on_rice basically season pass to advertise their new skin batch
[2:42:44] CDubTheRIPper: is it actually this time? LUL
[2:42:52] thunderhatter: i swear only league or dota tilts me like these games
[2:43:01] IllusionistTrixie: lol "bad mood"
[2:43:05] Jukettaja: Which app is it?
[2:43:14] thunderhatter: my underfarmed caitlyn kept engaging the fed enemy riven
[2:43:15] Jukettaja: Oh u dot gg
[2:43:21] Darkaros: PauseChamp is it time to get Regi in to flame him instead of a poor rando
[2:43:31] Kymix: KEKW

[2:43:37] CDubTheRIPper: LUL

[2:43:42] Kymix: oh dear lord
[2:43:43] Swiftfool: Mid was pretty trash yeh
[2:43:43] mayosilog: coz veigar isnt hitting stun
[2:43:44] ReginaldXIV: PauseChamp
[2:43:45] Joebeezer: LUL

[2:43:51] Kymix: you beat the rengar KEKW
[2:43:55] afreak10: Veigar missed all :P
[2:44:01] Victo0: mid probably was just premade with rengo and went after you ebcause you blamed rengar earlier
[2:44:02] Jukettaja: I don't think he got a good combo off in those last few fights I saw
[2:44:02] epicshoo: who the hell was defending him? wtf??
[2:44:04] LGNDRYNRG: LUL
[2:44:10] Daruvik: Before Sam left chat, he cursed you to have an 0/4 mid and to lose the game... Sam's curse is potent
[2:44:17] LGNDRYNRG: @itmeJP im sorry i wished that loss on you, but rengar got what he deserved
[2:44:21] the_real_beardcat: Clap to those chads

[2:45:05] HealJaldy: cohhHi Aurey
[2:45:28] biddi04: how do i get that live wallpaper
[2:45:38] CDubTheRIPper: NODDERS
[2:45:41] Barba06: you go where you please
[2:45:42] Darkaros: It's on Steam's Wallpaper Engine
[2:45:43] LordMannix: I think if I'm honest you're one of the big reasons your team almost turns it around. the only thing I'd suggest is next time you're in a situation where the team fights are what's going to win you the game, you need to be directing the engagements. Especially as the tank. Your team was shit and so as one of the better players you should try being more aggressive and praying the team works with you rather than against you.
[2:45:45] Lutcha81: @biddi04 wallpaper engine on steam
[2:45:49] biddi04: ty
[2:45:51] Daruvik: I just hope Rengar didn't link you the video NotLikeThis
[2:45:51] thunderhatter: press 4 buttons, and run at them
[2:45:52] Jukettaja: Yes
[2:45:53] IllusionistTrixie: no
[2:45:55] Jukettaja: Proguides are helpful
[2:46:02] Kymix: maybe
[2:46:09] Darkaros: Hmm I mean at least you're posting that wall in a time where JP might have time to read it
[2:46:15] omgitsjason: proguides is fine, mobalytics is fine also
[2:46:17] Trample11: potentially
[2:46:23] omgitsjason: basically the same
[2:46:27] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[2:46:27] epicshoo: i need more wall! Pepega 📣
[2:46:32] Kymix: I wonder if they will bring Mundo to the Arcane universe
[2:46:39] LGNDRYNRG: LOL
[2:46:42] Ekoki: jp wanna try gragas top? its actually really fun you can try tank but ap is more fun
[2:46:42] Jukettaja: I prefer their videos to "Best X guide" that is 30 minute gameplay video without any information given at all
[2:46:47] Athleon: How to play Mundo: Go where you please
[2:46:47] Barba06: That's part of the guide, miss your Qs to confuse enemies
[2:46:54] Joebeezer: wait riot got a copy of my last mundo game
[2:46:55] ReginaldXIV: @LordMannix He tried forcing team fights but his own team didn't want to initiate anything
[2:47:02] jjonnej: they're intentionally missing the Q's to zone their opponent
[2:47:16] jjonnej: very high elo strat
[2:47:33] LordMannix: @ReginaldXIV that's what I mean, apologies if it didn't want to come across, as the tank he has to be initiating, because he can take the hints whereas it was clear his team couldn't.
[2:47:35] jjonnej: i usually just shoot my ashe arrows to my own base to zone my opponents
[2:47:39] epicshoo: voli just sat under tower that whole time
[2:48:06] GGuts: NODDERS So you just have to be better than your enemy huh
[2:48:20] LGNDRYNRG: @GGuts i hope youre taking these notes
[2:48:30] epicshoo: PepoG get their HP to 0...
[2:48:31] afreak10: cohhNotes
[2:48:32] Kymix: that is pretty dec clear speed
[2:48:36] LordMannix: @ReginaldXIV he has the skill and had some occasions where if he just ran into the fight the potential was there. If the team went in as well.
[2:48:37] ReginaldXIV: ijpNODDERS
[2:48:41] ワフルデラ: "be good"
[2:49:01] Kymix: bUt HeALth iS TAnK
[2:49:02] Haeher: that model looks kinda funky rooWut
[2:49:07] Redacted_: 5 seconds too much and you are bad at jungling?
[2:49:07] GGuts: @lgndryrng PepoG Is there gonna be a test about this?
[2:49:23] LGNDRYNRG: @GGuts a midterm and a final
[2:49:34] GGuts: monkaS
[2:49:39] LGNDRYNRG: Kappa
[2:49:40] Scientist__: ijpSIP ijpSHRUG
[2:49:46] Victo0: @Redacted_ yep, because you loose a scuttle so you get half a level behind, which mean you can't fight for first dragon since they will have their ult and you don't
[2:50:01] Victo0: altho they nerfed scuttle xp so ti's not as bad as it was a few patches ago
[2:50:29] Everion: git gud at using W... understood PepoG
[2:50:36] Ekoki: say you have rengar
[2:50:37] Kymix: @Redacted_ if you are comparing to the absolute top tier junglers, then yeah. that 5 sec is pretty huge
[2:50:50] Athleon: Senna Kreygasm
[2:50:55] Athleon: love that champ
[2:51:01] ReginaldXIV: ADC Senna NODDERS
[2:51:13] Radcosh: did she ever explain what vgu means?
[2:51:16] Athleon: support Senna but you're the ADC all along :P
[2:51:36] Barba06: @Everion NODDERS
[2:52:07] Victo0: @itmeJP pretty sure the E was nerfed since they did that video
[2:52:09] ReginaldXIV: I like Senna as the main ADC with like a Lux
[2:52:22] LGNDRYNRG: did you learn anything JP?
[2:52:25] Papapwnage: @itmeJP nice to see your grind. I really love Gwen but shes alot harder to use
[2:52:36] Silver_Sol_x: JP have you tried Volibear at all?
[2:52:39] Jukettaja: Yeah I listened to her guide to max E and it's worked out fine so far
[2:52:43] Kymix: it depends who you are versing
[2:52:43] Redacted_: @Victo0 @Kymix im terrible at this game so i dont think id ever come close to that speed of clearing lol
[2:52:46] Swiftfool: Gwen is trash right now because of pro play
[2:52:52] Ekoki: you gotta try gragas jp
[2:52:53] Kymix: against range units, q is better
[2:52:54] epicshoo: time to spectate sam's game? PauseChamp
[2:52:55] Papapwnage: IMO mundo is bad early game now if you plan on doing any kind of trading
[2:53:00] soDugger: honeslty, like Kayle, 3 in q would be enough, E is better
[2:53:01] m3rcer: maxing E against another melee top is probably fine
[2:53:02] ReginaldXIV: nyasaSS
[2:53:02] GGuts: I guess the answer is as always: It depends on the matchup
[2:53:09] Deathevan: Ok I'm officially a mundo main now, need to download the game though
[2:53:39] LGNDRYNRG: chogath #1
[2:53:44] Papapwnage: @Deathevan do you hate your life enough?
[2:53:49] GrateWhiteDope: I love mundo but only in jungle
[2:53:54] Victo0: @Redacted_ highly depends on the champion too, fiddle, kayn or shaco get really fast first clear so ti's easier to train with those, then each champion has their own quick on how to clear efficiently
[2:54:10] Kymix: @Redacted_ it is all about practice. but clear speed is extremely popular, it dictates who can reach scuttle first or gank first, which can heavily influence the tempo of the game
[2:54:22] Victo0: *quirk
[2:54:36] LGNDRYNRG: you're too far in to do it now
[2:54:38] Ekoki: profile i think
[2:54:39] The_zuriel: cant do it in a lobby
[2:54:42] LGNDRYNRG: would have to do it from profile i think
[2:54:46] Victo0: @itmeJP from profile in main menu
[2:54:48] Swiftfool: from profile presets
[2:54:52] GGuts: Can't do it here afaik
[2:54:53] Papapwnage: @Victo0 I mained jungle for over a decade. I hate it currently. To laner dependent, lower gold income, terrible xp and you get blamed for team objectives solo.
[2:54:58] Caarcus: you have to open the files and delete them from the profile presets file
[2:55:10] debajr: oh no, a Fiora. I hate Fiora...
[2:55:19] Ekoki: fiora top
[2:55:23] Swiftfool: @Papapwnage jungle is the strongest role lol
[2:55:24] Zizen: Oh Great Fiora
[2:55:36] Victo0: @Papapwnage yeah, same, I have mùoved to main support for a while now, but I still enjoy jungling with shyvana ap, you just ignore your team (mostly) and then once you get two items you just destroys anyone.
[2:55:38] GGuts: Usually the default recommended things are pretty good though
[2:55:43] GrateWhiteDope: Fiora is rage inducing
[2:55:44] epicshoo: oof fiora Sadge
[2:55:45] Papapwnage: @Swiftfool that is not my opinion
[2:55:55] IllusionistTrixie: pre-season ranked is a WILD time
[2:55:57] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord

[2:56:00] DagooX: greyCR
[2:56:01] Kymix: ahhh you found the person who just finished Arcane
[2:56:07] Papapwnage: @Victo0 support is way too strong atm. Support/Mid decide games atm
[2:56:11] Sonatta: i'm not sure that program is helpful LUL
[2:56:17] thunderhatter: at least you know beforehand? LUL
[2:56:21] GrateWhiteDope: exhaust or ignite might be a good counter spell for fiora
[2:56:28] ReginaldXIV: that's a brawl team lol
[2:56:28] LGNDRYNRG: zed jungle is a thing
[2:56:29] LGNDRYNRG: ?
[2:56:34] Trample11: Your team got more skins, ez win
[2:56:38] IllusionistTrixie: oh god jungle zed
[2:56:39] Swiftfool: ye zed and talong jung new meta
[2:56:42] DrYaguar: yes
[2:56:46] IllusionistTrixie: yeah it 100% is a thing and I HATE it
[2:56:49] Ekoki: ward
[2:56:54] GrateWhiteDope: zed seem like a awful jungler lol
[2:57:03] LGNDRYNRG: @Ekoki the game auto gives it to oyu when you leave lane
[2:57:03] Kymix: i fucking love that car
[2:57:05] Victo0: @Papapwnage depends on the elo, until plat I have a better winrate just winging it mid than playing my main role as support
[2:57:06] LGNDRYNRG: leave base**
[2:57:09] Ekoki: oh ok
[2:57:15] IllusionistTrixie: sit in the tri brush to protect ganks
[2:57:16] Zizen: haha this skin is awesome
[2:57:20] Swiftfool: get vision in river tbh
[2:57:21] omgitsjason: usually down by raptors
[2:57:22] LGNDRYNRG: @Ekoki when's the last time you played? LUL
[2:57:26] LGNDRYNRG: game ahs changed a lot
[2:57:28] IllusionistTrixie: you can move further into the river
[2:57:30] Ekoki: too long ago :D
[2:57:31] Papapwnage: @itmeJP as top side, you should be sitting in the bush at red so your jungle doesnt get fucked
[2:57:32] SinkingWings: sit where vision is needed
[2:57:34] IllusionistTrixie: where you are
[2:57:38] The_zuriel: There is fine, just be aware that you might need to go leash for ur jungle if he starts on your side
[2:57:38] omgitsjason: stay on your side of river
[2:57:39] everkn0wn: You want to cover invade together with mid
[2:57:40] Swiftfool: entrance of tri bush area
[2:57:49] Papapwnage: no where fiddle is currently
[2:57:52] IllusionistTrixie: then go help your jungle clear red IF they are start red
[2:57:54] wwwMASTER: when im top i sit near red in bush, and drop ward when i leave for lane
[2:58:11] Dredstryde: no leash
[2:58:11] Papapwnage: no you are in tribush that was just a terrible suggestion from someone
[2:58:12] EvilLego6: what did jp use to tell him about his streak and whether or not the his allies were playing their characters for the first time?
[2:58:13] omgitsjason: that is tri-bush
[2:58:14] Dredstryde: fiddles so sad
[2:58:15] LGNDRYNRG: they told you 2 different thing
[2:58:19] DawnofFrost_art: Basically you wanna sit in a spot to give your jg an idea of if hes being invaded or if they ward his buff. @itmeJP
[2:58:28] Swiftfool: Fiddle should ward his red/blue then back buy sweeper then go to opposite camp u just need to protect ur top entrance
[2:58:28] GrateWhiteDope: fiddle doesnt really need a leash
[2:58:46] Ekoki: dont fall behind
[2:58:51] afreak10: it was with kench tho
[2:58:51] xunsim: she can parry your skill and stun you
[2:58:52] Zizen: fiddle def does not need a leash
[2:58:54] thunderhatter: whats the red outline under MUNDO
[2:58:55] Victo0: @itmeJP you can walk back to reset her mark if it's toward her, will save you a bunch of hp in lane
[2:58:59] GGuts: Top lane still gives me ptsd and I haven't been playing in many years LUL
[2:59:00] Papapwnage: Try not to give her access to your "vital" spots that are being marked
[2:59:01] Dredstryde: @klitz2013 EVERY JUNGLE benefits from a leash to match clear times - anything else is lazy
[2:59:01] Zizen: just dont feed her lol
[2:59:18] Nihrz: @thunderhatter thats fioras passive
[2:59:28] GrateWhiteDope: @Dredstryde i know they do, im just saying fid will be fine
[2:59:30] The_zuriel: @Dredstryde no if fiddle knows what he's doing u start raptors and red at the same time and u 100% dont leash that
[2:59:30] Swiftfool: @Dredstryde leashing gives up a lot of lane prio, specially in certain match ups many times pros will not leash
[2:59:30] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[3:00:03] IllusionistTrixie: with Fiora you wanna try and get your grasp procs off and then leave, without taking much from her hitting your vitals (thats the bracket things that appear around you)
[3:00:03] epicshoo: that was some nice CS'ing
[3:00:20] Papapwnage: Chat did any of you buy any steam sale games? I was considering noita but the games I really wanted had fuck all discounts
[3:00:31] Dredstryde: @Swiftfool You're comparing pros to jp?  @The_zuriel there is no reason to not leash him to increase his clear speed.
[3:00:36] Ekoki: let fiddle know that he used flash if you want
[3:00:36] enricofairme: danP
[3:00:45] TsunamiRoy: you can hold space to centre camera
[3:00:46] The_zuriel: @Dredstryde no pros dont do the double start cause its prone to invades
[3:00:50] The_zuriel: but every fiddle in soloq does
[3:01:06] Swiftfool: you can just walk to lane there no need to tp
[3:01:14] Ekoki: tab+click fiora's flash
[3:01:25] Papapwnage: JP you are far too calm to be playing league RN
[3:01:28] IllusionistTrixie: ah zed's bottom you're good
[3:01:41] everkn0wn: pot
[3:01:41] enricofairme: monkaS

[3:02:27] Ekoki: this is not a game of whys or hows jp
[3:02:37] Papapwnage: that green thing above your that ticks down indicates a good oppotunity to trade to get more hp and do dmg
[3:02:40] Victo0: @itmeJP side note : your e is an auto reset, it's much more efficient to do auto then E instantly after you hear the hit happened
[3:02:40] Damarus914: Mundo does what he pleases

[3:39:38] GraveSalad: avoid
[3:39:46] frilled: did someone say masterchef? Pog
[3:39:46] m3rcer: it just makes them not your team now i think?
[3:39:51] ReginaldXIV: There should definitely be an avoidance system in LoL. But it's rare to queue with the same people
[3:40:00] The_zuriel: @itmeJP just so you know, if u dodge again in the next 24 hours u get a 12 hour lockout
[3:40:02] The_Faceless_Void: No new client and no avoidance system
[3:40:02] afreak10: make another account
[3:40:03] DizzyGunner: what happened with the uber yesterday?

[3:40:11] GraveSalad: @m3rcer I mean, that's the issue here so that's what JP wanted
[3:40:11] xunsim: this is the company who hasnt made a streamer mode in over 10 years
[3:40:14] bulletsponge55: League will put you in a low priority queue if you dodge too much and your match times take forever to get in
[3:40:16] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW
[3:40:17] ReginaldXIV: oh no Strippin
[3:40:19] Shoaron: I think in 4k+ games i've queued against my friends 2 times

[3:40:34] ReginaldXIV: That's embarassing
[3:40:41] darkrhulad: to be fair it was kinda a bad leash by his team
[3:40:57] Darkaros: oh shit we're watching Sam PepoChamp time to watch my boy lose at another league game
[3:40:58] Hyperexx: not recommended
[3:41:01] Shoaron: you can play anyone top tbh

[3:41:02] futanahri_: YEP
[3:41:03] ワフルデラ: Panth can go anywhere tbh
[3:41:09] br4nd0nh347: yes you can
[3:41:11] GGuts: Panth was a top laner long before he was played in jungle
[3:41:14] STNbond: id like to see JP play more Darius for the dunks
[3:41:14] Ageisfang: back in my day pantheon was only top
[3:41:15] The_zuriel: More of a toplaner than a jungler these days

[3:41:48] darkrhulad: He's a good tanky boy though
[3:41:48] LGNDRYNRG: darius can carry
[3:41:49] Cronopolis: Panth can top, mid, support, jungle
[3:41:54] afreak10: mundo can do more
[3:41:55] Shoaron: Darius is a good carry
[3:41:58] Hyperexx: jax has alot of carry potential

[3:42:14] Zizen: ijpKEK  what was that
[3:42:14] darkrhulad: Gmart is really good with kench, seems to be able to carry with him
[3:42:21] GGuts: Have you ever tried Quickcast with Mundo? It's basically casting on key press and not on release. Much faster/more responsive.
[3:42:24] holycaliburn: sion is a split pusher and just wins games killing towers, if u wanna try him
[3:42:27] ワフルデラ: you should try Panth, he has great poke potential and execution potential because of his guaranteed crit @itmeJP
[3:42:28] Jukettaja: Yone is worth learning
[3:42:32] Shoaron: BBoomer BBoomer BBoomer

[3:42:57] The_zuriel: @emaraldragon fizz summons a shark

[3:45:47] pandalisk9: im suprised nobody died there
[3:45:51] LGNDRYNRG: he did use his E
[3:45:57] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[3:46:00] StompyRobo: oh did he
[3:46:04] LGNDRYNRG: and got 2 autos off
[3:46:04] Shoaron: LUL
[3:46:07] ReginaldXIV: he leashed himself again
[3:46:17] StompyRobo: i dunno if jg is actually new player freindly
[3:46:24] StompyRobo: cuz it just requires alot of game knowlage
[3:46:35] ReginaldXIV: I find jungler the easiest role but that's just me
[3:46:39] Zijira: music works with this deer skipping through the forest
[3:46:45] StompyRobo: it is easy fi yuove played alot of league
[3:46:49] Victo0: @StompyRobo well it's not, but also the more things you have to learn, the faster you can progress if your eally invest yourself into it
[3:46:53] RlDennis: It's not. But if you learn basic pathing and have a good feel for 'This guy is out of position' it's pretty easy to pick up
[3:46:55] ReginaldXIV: It does require knowledge and leading plays though
[3:47:02] ワフルデラ: jungler is easy if you know when to go into the lanes for a gank
[3:47:14] StompyRobo: yeah but i mean more objectives and timings on invades and shit like that
[3:47:18] ワフルデラ: if you don't know when to gank you're stuck farming your jungle
[3:47:21] Darkaros: MmmHmm
[3:47:22] LGNDRYNRG: also if you jungle, prepare to brunt all of the blame when anything goes wrong in any lane
[3:47:23] StompyRobo: its easy to mess up if your not careful
[3:47:30] Tronix_604: jungle can be rookie friendly with a leash and decent pings, but this is league so gluck
[3:47:35] StompyRobo: @lgndryrng true
[3:47:41] ReginaldXIV: The blame train usually starts at jungling yeah
[3:47:43] ReginaldXIV: Then Top lane
[3:47:47] Hyperexx: play for drakes as jungler and you win most of your games in silver/gold
[3:47:51] StompyRobo: MonkaS
[3:47:58] Shoaron: ijpKEK
[3:48:01] ワフルデラ: monkaS there goes the game
[3:48:05] CDubTheRIPper: cohhJam

[3:48:30] Darkaros: @ReginaldXIV JP's League queue
[3:48:30] StompyRobo: lee is really weak atm
[3:48:32] Victo0: @Hyperexx once got a gold 1 main jungle telling me that drakes are useless, not sure how he even got there with that mentality
[3:48:33] Price_FTW: open eyes?
[3:48:33] Shoaron: always ban Lee when you playing a squishy jungler
[3:48:40] LGNDRYNRG: @Darkaros Kappa

[3:52:24] Viriskali15: as a midlane mage player I despise yone

[3:52:57] Midnight4life: yone's ult is a dash that knock's up and does pretty good damage.
[3:53:04] Lobonidas: yeah
[3:53:11] Lobonidas: you should use preseason to practice stuff
[3:53:14] KAHVITEK: The League roster is massive, something to everyone.
[3:53:17] Cronopolis: Yones ult is the channeled rectangle
[3:53:19] Victo0: @itmeJP yone is just a gigantic pain to play against
[3:53:20] Price_FTW: i mean for good reason.. doesnt matter if he ints his ass off hes a free win champ

[3:56:16] JohnnyK0502: what does the dragon do???
[3:56:19] Gat0rCh0mp: @AinzN monkaW
[3:56:31] Papapwnage: @JohnnyK0502 every drag is a different element
[3:56:37] LGNDRYNRG: inb4 permaban
[3:56:45] AinzN: Gat0rCh0mp saves you the million points ijpKEK
[3:56:50] thatguyuknow985: Each dragon gives a buff based on their element
[3:56:58] Papapwnage: @JohnnyK0502 but ess it changes gameplay by adding buffs
[3:57:04] ReginaldXIV: Prancing

[3:57:53] The_zuriel: even without a skin
[3:58:04] JohnnyK0502: @Papapwnage  is it always the same rotation for dragons?

[3:58:41] OreynXD: KEKW
[3:58:48] Mujona: Think he was tryin' to excute to not give gold
[3:58:54] debajr: No, Yone tried to die to tower instead of player

[3:59:23] epicshoo: he'll be so tilted if you go over there to curse him Crungo
[3:59:36] Price_FTW: dont even need to curse him. just assume the league ration of 50% of the time one of the teams will devolve into an inting dumpster fire
[3:59:37] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour.

[3:59:53] Price_FTW: ads monkaS
[4:00:04] Shoaron: Trist is doing ok
[4:00:11] The_zuriel: Every lane losing while u jungle is the most tilting thing in the world.

[4:01:06] ItsAlwaysNow: Lee sin is a tough champ that isnt very good right now
[4:01:25] Jukettaja: Lee Sin was a monster top lane a couple of patches ago
[4:01:27] pandalisk9: his kick deals the most dmg when you kick people through the team
[4:01:29] AinzN: Yes
[4:01:32] ワフルデラ: you need to kick the person well if you ult to make great use of it

[4:03:48] The_zuriel: I don't mind overwolf either, but some people take issue with them
[4:03:48] Mujona: It is invasive
[4:03:52] Sonatta: Spyware and they ruined Curse
[4:04:08] The_zuriel: they had a security breach years ago that they never recovered from reputation wise.

[4:05:56] The_zuriel: @itmeJP just so u know how dodgeing works, first dodge is 5mins, second dodge is 30mins and third dodge is 12 hours.   The timer resets 24 hours after your first dodge, then your back to 5mins
[4:06:07] jollydadbod: Did she hook you up with a riot account at least
[4:06:17] Jukettaja: Good to know before hand I suppose

[4:17:58] soDugger: he has ult
[4:18:16] soDugger: nah, you got him
[4:18:20] ReginaldXIV: Kindred has at least 3 marks
[4:18:25] ReginaldXIV: monkaSHAKE
[4:18:45] Viriskali15: when Laning top do you have to care about early objectives at all?
[4:18:45] Papapwnage: saving it for next game is a long running meme from when doublelift would save flash and end the teams chances at wins

[4:19:25] Daruvik: promote synergy: like a boss
[4:19:27] Papapwnage: shit on debras desk
[4:19:41] LGNDRYNRG: @Midnight4life you only regain the HP if you hit the enemy w/ it
[4:19:55] Viriskali15: JP are you watching Succession at all? my wife and I just started it, pretty good!
[4:20:14] LGNDRYNRG: @Midnight4life after a few seconds, it pops, deals more dmg to enemies, and if you hit a champ then you get back the grey health
[4:20:18] Midnight4life: @lgndryrng ah okay... hmmm
[4:20:25] GrimEnd: stacked kindred monkaS

[4:24:03] afreak10: nice save
[4:24:20] Papatiku: double nice save
[4:24:35] Nathrael: JP are you enjoying Mundo more than Teemo?
[4:24:35] Brightbane: Twitch casually comes over to kill steal and head back out
[4:24:45] MrPogsin: @lgndryrng 800k mastery in silver... FeelsAmazingMan
[4:24:46] afreak10: ward river
[4:25:05] ReginaldXIV: on the bright side the other team is just dps with no major support
[4:26:08] Ignisgladius: yeah, if kindred gets enough marks for AA range increase it's gonna be annoying
[4:26:22] titanodin: my biggest problem with mundo is his lack of hard cc
[4:26:28] m3rcer: ijpKEK
[4:26:36] Osage202: whats his ign?
[4:26:50] LGNDRYNRG: you have no teleport lol

[4:31:15] andreaslorozco: your ult was up too
[4:31:18] Ceadeuss: oh he has hullbreaker gonna be hard to 1v1 him
[4:31:18] Traveler4: he never ulted
[4:31:30] jollydadbod: he didnt ult
[4:31:31] holycaliburn: his 1 kinda looks like his ult
[4:31:32] jollydadbod: until then
[4:31:45] Midnight4life: Yeah it sucks that garens ult does true damage too.. other wise you would have been fine.
[4:32:10] afreak10: yep
[4:32:12] Havixx: doesnt garens ult do more dmg based on enemies missing hp
[4:32:26] Mortumee: @Havixx indeed
[4:32:26] RlDennis: It does
[4:32:27] Ceadeuss: @Havixx yes it does % of missing hp
[4:32:35] debajr: I believe so Havixx
[4:32:46] Havixx: theres been so many changes to league champs i forget sometimes haha
[4:32:47] RlDennis: I don't remember when it does true damage though, or if it always does
[4:32:49] Sovekz: Good old times before the Garen rework, villain mechanic wasn't perfect but was better than this garbage now
[4:33:07] afreak10: guess not
[4:33:08] RlDennis: He could maybe win if he hits his ult vs you. Yasuo ultimate gives him bonus armor ppenetration
[4:33:14] ReginaldXIV: The Yasuo has been getting beat up in mid
[4:33:33] TPLivewire: Kinda shitty move by Twitch but....
[4:33:44] Havixx: ok... the bee malz skin maybe the greatest skin in the game lol
[4:33:46] Ceadeuss: their team in general is really good at killing tanks
[4:33:49] afreak10: yikes
[4:33:55] ReginaldXIV: I wish people would let the dragon leave the spawn
[4:34:08] RlDennis: Same LUL
[4:34:31] MrPogsin: Dont leavve
[4:34:32] MrPogsin: let team die

[4:34:38] TPLivewire: You are damned if you do, damned if you don't
[4:34:43] ReginaldXIV: What's Garen building?
[4:34:49] Ceadeuss: when i play toplane i like to pretend the other lanes dont exist
[4:34:50] DoctorWhiteFace: Top like an island. lol never leave
[4:35:02] jollydadbod: You just ff these
[4:35:06] andreaslorozco: dont leave, beat garen 1v1, take towers yourself
[4:35:13] TPLivewire: Nah, don't FF
[4:35:19] soDugger: he has a fed Jg, he can afford to not teamfight
[4:35:36] holycaliburn: personally i just fight for objectives by tp in, otherwise i stay in lane wehn that happens
[4:35:49] ReginaldXIV: Garen and Kindred can duo
[4:35:51] SoulEroder: i just read a great explanation of LoL. It is a gacha game in which you are pulling for a good team and using sanity as the currency.
[4:35:55] TPLivewire: 2 man baron?
[4:35:57] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:35:57] Ceadeuss: kindreds dps is nutty
[4:35:58] TPLivewire: Damn
[4:36:07] pandalisk9: should kill your wolves to deny the kindred passive stack
[4:36:27] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[4:36:41] holycaliburn: he loses, a lot i guess
[4:36:45] Sovekz: He probably doesn't play ranked too much, you gain them in normals too
[4:36:51] Ignisgladius: You earn mastery points in normals too
[4:36:55] RlDennis: Some people never learn to play the map, but just play their champs. Also rotating game modes and arams count aswell
[4:37:02] Ceadeuss: theres a mundo on na with 11 million points on mundo and is silver 3
[4:37:41] RlDennis: I have some friends that are honestly pretty decent players, if only they used their brains a bit more ijpKEK
[4:38:01] afreak10: yasuo bot
[4:38:12] Brightbane: Big if huge
[4:38:13] ReginaldXIV: there goes the avantage for them
[4:38:22] Jukettaja: You could get Gargoyle Stoneplate against the Garen ult
[4:38:26] RlDennis: I love that car ijpKEK
[4:38:38] Jukettaja: Or any shield items really
[4:38:42] Ellynas: dude, your playlist is chill. Do you have a link or anything ?
[4:38:49] lemoncrazedcamel: @RlDennis I feel like this is most people. Just need to learn to play the map and spread their leads from lane
[4:39:16] kibriel: are you slapping your foes with a bag of money, jp?
[4:39:18] Dieinpeace1: mundo just farming top while team is team fighting Kappa
[4:39:19] civvi: !rank
[4:39:19] itmeBOT: As of November 20, 2021, JP is Silver III in League of Legends (playing ADC)! JP started his League journey in October 2021.
[4:39:21] Darkaros: !lofi
[4:39:21] itmeBOT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8a45UZJGh4 Is the chill music JP plays during League of Legends, from League of Legends!
[4:39:31] Ryuushinn: some1 else should clear the lane and u follow team around since ur pretty strong atm
[4:39:40] Darkaros: rank command is still accurate, JP's swapped to Top MmmHmm
[4:39:47] RlDennis: Oh definitely. Most people focus too much on their own thing rather than the whole game. Which honestly is fine, some people are just playing to unwind after work or something @lemoncrazedcamel
[4:39:57] Ellynas: thanks @Darkaros =)
[4:40:23] lemoncrazedcamel: @RlDennis Yeh true, just unwind in normals or flex xD
[4:40:35] jimmichristensen: what elo is that?
[4:40:52] MellonFarm: @itmeJP you have 2 words use them on ur top side to get some vision
[4:40:57] RlDennis: I'd problaby play solo/duo to chill because I just enjoy games that are around my skill level.
[4:41:04] PPowzer74: how much dmg was that ulti from garen wtf
[4:41:15] afreak10: hp based ult
[4:41:29] ReginaldXIV: stoneplate
[4:41:30] Traveler4: HP
[4:41:30] Jukettaja: Gargoyle
[4:41:31] RlDennis: Yeah
[4:41:32] lemoncrazedcamel: @RlDennis Every Q has mmr so all will be your skill level
[4:41:43] Traveler4: Does Warmogs with the health regen still exist?
[4:41:45] Jukettaja: Sterak's Cage is also worthwhile
[4:41:45] mastermind2563: moggs its true damage
[4:41:49] Papapwnage: its not true dmg anymore i believe its mazgic
[4:41:52] Ryuushinn: whats his ult phys or ability dmg?
[4:41:58] ReginaldXIV: blue trinket might be good too
[4:42:00] PPowzer74: it's true dmg
[4:42:09] RlDennis: @lemoncrazedcamel I mean.. my normal mmr I get like plat players, aram I get diamond/masters and solo/duo I get gold ijpKEK
[4:42:15] mastermind2563: true it was in white
[4:42:19] The_zuriel: It is true damage thats why it was white instead of blue in the damage breakdown
[4:42:39] MellonFarm: you can't really counter true dmg on garen anyway
[4:42:49] Traveler4: because it bounces
[4:42:55] Ryuushinn: maybe a guardian angel or just more hp to deal with it then
[4:42:59] Papapwnage: chat right, for some reason i thought it was reworked. It's true dmg
[4:43:13] epicshoo: it's uhh your fault?
[4:43:26] TXPumpFIST: effects like staraks are counters somewhat to execute effects
[4:43:32] MyMansBart: Time to blame the only one that didn't feed kindred KEKW
[4:43:36] keepittwisted: his passive hit you and you almost killed ez with it he lived with only a sliver
[4:43:36] TXPumpFIST: and hp / regen
[4:43:37] Jukettaja: I just love the way Mundo walks
[4:43:50] GrimEnd: or drives
[4:43:51] Price_FTW: the little car kills me everytime i see it lmao
[4:43:52] a6314: the only thing I'd ever want to play league for is the chat, it's gotta be great entertainment
[4:43:55] ReginaldXIV: dragon monkaSHAKE
[4:43:56] Darkaros: Hmm has someone math'd when it's dumb to recall to base vs walk because i do that thing JP just did a lot too
[4:43:57] lemoncrazedcamel: Randuins and frozen heart are probably must buys this game
[4:44:15] afreak10: LUL
[4:44:15] lemoncrazedcamel: 4 ad hyper carries
[4:44:22] afreak10: 2nd dragon they steal
[4:44:25] Jukettaja: @Darkaros I'm sure someone has
[4:44:26] drunkencpt: ye, randuins is pretty good
[4:44:38] RlDennis: @Darkaros yes.
[4:44:41] Pangchop: @Darkaros i think from the ring around inhib towers its quciker to walk
[4:44:44] afreak10: big
[4:44:52] RlDennis: If you're at the base gates, it's generally faster to walk than recall
[4:45:01] afreak10: F
[4:45:07] Jukettaja: That's just Garen
[4:45:10] lemoncrazedcamel: That is mundo useless teamfighterr if he cant run down the squishy
[4:45:14] The_zuriel: Brand just omega fucks beefy boys
[4:45:21] MyMansBart: Time to learn Yone and solo carru
[4:45:28] Papapwnage: As mundo your job is to be annoying and be backline threat
[4:45:36] afreak10: even with Baron buff team got deleted
[4:45:37] leovic1: ijpOLLIE
[4:45:48] Midnight4life: yeah mundo has changed, I use to main him and I just don't know what to do with him anymore.
[4:45:49] AinzN: That scared the crap out of me there!
[4:45:58] MellonFarm: Tanks fall off the longer the game goes on, once they get void/ lw youre going to melt
[4:46:14] Papapwnage: ^
[4:46:21] Midnight4life: Tahm Kench can go full tank and do so much more damage as a tank top laner because all his damage abilities scale with HP.
[4:47:01] enricofairme: monkaS
[4:47:17] Papapwnage: @itmeJP if you want a general overall good duelist and backline threat without any real counters - JAX is pretty amazing
[4:47:21] Jukettaja: Depends on the champion for sure
[4:47:21] Pangchop: top is the worst role by far
[4:47:26] Kymix: that describes top tbh
[4:47:28] The_zuriel: Yeah top is the worst role easily
[4:47:30] Athleon: top has the less agency in the game for sure
[4:47:34] Tenethos: 104 kills game, what the hell. should learn to close games when you have the advantage
[4:47:36] Price_FTW: i feel like a high percentage of my losses come from top lanes getting crushed though
[4:47:37] lemoncrazedcamel: Top has the least influence until you get to higher elo and can make cross map tps based of good wards
[4:47:50] Sovekz: Impact as adc? KEKW
[4:47:52] Darkaros: this is why when i learned dota and got my cousins to learn it we just spammed random until we realized every hero/role was shit
[4:47:55] ProxyClouds: Feels like Mundo is very dependent on the rest of the team doing well and doing dmg.
[4:47:55] Kymix: lol
[4:47:58] Papapwnage: It's all relative to who gets fed and team comp
[4:48:02] 쿠마ㅏㅏㅏ: if want a lot of impact probably should look into jungle or mid
[4:48:07] titanodin: so far you been mainly tanks top not fighters
[4:48:09] Kymix: You gotta learn to go bot to shit on adcs MiniK
[4:48:15] loxx8310: you are playing a fed team tho
[4:48:24] Jukettaja: You do have more games as ADC so that might explain it
[4:48:26] ProxyClouds: And the lack of CC on Mundo is big.
[4:48:33] Rezzak77: it feels like top needs a big CC or ult to feel good or a bruiser to back line
[4:48:34] Tenethos: everybody is fed in this game
[4:48:43] The_zuriel: Next patch adc's should get fucked by tops less, u cant tp to anything but towers pre 15mins. so you won't get tped on by tops and just shat on
[4:48:49] StarPogPlatinum: Mundo just have a slow
[4:48:53] xunsim: jp going thru the jungle main pipeline
[4:49:06] afreak10: geez
[4:49:08] StarPogPlatinum: oof
[4:49:08] Mortumee: Mundo is just a meatshield and they have too many threats and tank busters to deal with you, so you're pointless lategame
[4:49:09] MyMansBart: What made you decide to swap to top?
[4:49:12] RlDennis: Top lane it's hard to find a safe pick you can play without getting completely countered
[4:49:12] loxx8310: yikes
[4:49:13] Pangchop: jesus
[4:49:16] Ceadeuss: brands wild
[4:49:17] MyMansBart: damn
[4:49:19] ReginaldXIV: Can't you QSS brand's ult?
[4:49:28] MellonFarm: don't think so
[4:49:29] Midnight4life: Was the brand playing support or mid?
[4:49:32] The_zuriel: you can qss the slow i guess
[4:49:35] The_zuriel: but it will still bounce
[4:49:38] Darkaros: LUL
[4:49:38] RlDennis: No, it bounces. it's his passive that deals a ton of damage in teamfights
[4:49:46] Woodyx89: yup
[4:49:50] Kymix: lepOOF
[4:49:50] Midnight4life: damn...
[4:49:50] RJantara: YEs
[4:49:51] Ryuushinn: 19k gold thou
[4:49:51] Jukettaja: I would say knowing your strengths is what it comes down to and match ups. This was an unfavorable match up too so it was hard to get going with Garen around to ult you at any point.
[4:49:59] afreak10: LUL
[4:50:04] Ryuushinn: hes the most farm in game xD
[4:50:04] Jukettaja: At least I can relate to the feeling when I pick up new champs and roles
[4:50:06] soDugger: yeah,
[4:50:06] Papapwnage: brand is vulnerable to assassins. Yes in low elo supports are gods, free gold, get to roam and gank
[4:50:06] RlDennis: Yeah. His passive deals max hp damage in a circle after hitting enemies with 3 abilities. (and the passive counts too)
[4:50:08] AnorienNightwish: ijpWTF
[4:50:09] Mortumee: Brand this game: "Look at me, I'm the carry now"
[4:50:11] Ceadeuss: yeah brand gets liandrys and thats all that matters its the worst lol
[4:50:11] xunsim: he doesnt have ward item KEKW
[4:50:12] soDugger: Brand support
[4:50:13] NeonHermitt: "Support"
[4:50:13] holycaliburn: "support"
[4:50:17] holycaliburn: lol
[4:50:24] Sovekz: He supports you in dying
[4:50:26] AinzN: ijpSAD
[4:50:27] RlDennis: So it sets off a chain reaction of explosions
[4:50:27] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[4:50:32] mastermind2563: Yep brand has a stun so he can support then go haymaker killing machine
[4:50:41] Papapwnage: You got this JP its time for the comeback arc
[4:50:50] ワフルデラ: I just downloaded porofessor, it's pretty cool ngl
[4:51:16] tyraell92: do you know what you needed mate? a Witcher for the brand. toss a coin next time
[4:51:33] MyMansBart: You're swan is you're adc now
[4:51:37] MyMansBart: *swain
[4:51:38] Tenethos: jungler should help lae that can carry. going top and getting mundo fed doesnt really matter
[4:51:44] Papapwnage: @tyraell92 i just finished season 2 Kreygasm
[4:51:46] lemoncrazedcamel: Yuumi mundo could be pog for you. Unkillable
[4:51:46] Tenethos: lane*
[4:51:54] Papapwnage: Yummi on mundo makes you basically unkillable
[4:51:56] SHOoOoOZAN: JP you been enjoying league?
[4:52:05] Darkaros: OOOO The possibly-racist dude is back
[4:52:07] Jukettaja: lol
[4:52:10] Darkaros: LUL
[4:52:14] ghostsofcarcosa: league isn't to be enjoyed its to be endured
[4:52:15] Ceadeuss: the only real awnser
[4:52:16] Jukettaja: Par for the course
[4:52:17] tyraell92: @papapwnage pretty good, though I enjoyed the first one more^^
[4:52:18] Papapwnage: Define enjoy...
[4:52:19] FluentZap: Woo more league!
[4:52:24] SHOoOoOZAN: why play it then
[4:52:24] RlDennis: I have no clue, I haven't really gotten the same people in my ranked games ever
[4:52:24] mayosilog: league is a grind

[4:52:47] SHOoOoOZAN: why do people play it, its a huge time consumer
[4:52:47] chippye: watching you so I don't have to play myself
[4:52:48] lemoncrazedcamel: No one enjoys league... Riot just sucks your soul in and never let you out
[4:52:49] Midnight4life: I haven't really been playing but you got me wanting to try again.
[4:52:50] Kaleith: peepoLeave peepoLeave peepoLeave

[4:53:47] FluentZap: oof, the push king... damn susan...
[4:53:48] Daruvik: monkaSHAKE susaN
[4:53:49] StarPogPlatinum: I actually stopped League because my hands couldn't handle me playing that much LUL
[4:53:51] Jukettaja: I always struggle against Nasus
[4:53:53] Shurai7: which salt its better chat, League or Strive ?
[4:53:54] Ryuushinn: wion befroe 40 min or u lose thats nassus in a nutshell
[4:53:59] RlDennis: Nasus is .. kind of annoying. But I think Mundo is fine into this matchup?
[4:54:07] RJantara: Never let him alone in the lane
[4:54:10] drunkencpt: Have you looked up some top macro guides?
[4:54:19] titanodin: i wonder if the nasus knows how to freeze the lane
[4:54:36] RlDennis: I don't think either of you really has kill pressure, you have better poke though
[4:54:43] Papapwnage: I've been enjoying Loop Hero got it free from the epic giveaways.
[4:54:49] 14neo: oof D:
[4:54:55] 14neo: 230 Nasus games?
[4:55:01] epicshoo: pepeBASSHD darknesssss

[4:55:27] Daruvik: well GG, Lux wins Clap
[4:55:28] Ryuushinn: thats alot of lux
[4:55:29] Kymix: She has been out for a while
[4:55:31] Sovekz: Easy, I have 700k on Garen
[4:55:32] lemoncrazedcamel: Lux - most mained champion in the game lol
[4:55:37] dendennny: bruhh
[4:55:38] titanodin: lux is fun thats how
[4:55:38] epicshoo: she's a classic KEKLEO
[4:55:38] RlDennis: I think my highest mastery champs are Thresh and Morgana at 160k
[4:55:42] The_zuriel: Like someone said earlier, theres a guy on NA with 11million points on mundo and he's like silver @itmeJP
[4:55:43] Darkaros: wdym jp she's a waifu with a laser beam and op as shit
[4:55:58] tyraell92: that is really an issue
[4:55:58] zynessa: I guess someone's shit out of lux this game
[4:55:59] MyMansBart: Please brand don't feed the lux Prayge
[4:56:11] Papapwnage: i love seeing you psych yourself out
[4:56:23] Workster: !jpedia
[4:56:23] itmeBOT: For what JP is planning to stream, a list of games coming out this year, JP's specs and much more check out JPedia! - https://jpedia.net
[4:56:29] tyraell92: that dude has to shut his pc down and go see the world every now and then xd
[4:56:31] Blueplzz: Wait when did season become support?
[4:56:41] kibriel: confirmed, jp does the mundo walk around his house
[4:56:41] Kaleith: did your mid play a lot of that hero or is he Brand new?
[4:56:42] Blueplzz: Swain **

[4:56:59] lemoncrazedcamel: Protecting the invade pog
[4:57:01] zynessa: oh boy
[4:57:04] Darkaros: that man has been broken by previous games
[4:57:04] zynessa: this is gonna be a doozy
[4:57:09] glennjamin23: Responding haHAA
[4:57:17] RlDennis: @Blueplzz when his passive was reworked after his rework ijpKEK
[4:57:23] MyMansBart: positive mentality POGGERS
[4:57:25] holycaliburn: yes
[4:57:26] Papapwnage: imagine being positive
[4:57:26] omgitsjason: dont let him stack his Q on minions
[4:57:27] lemoncrazedcamel: you beat him 1 v1 until first item
[4:57:30] Papapwnage: no, its a farm lane
[4:57:33] tyraell92: the less you let him farm, the better
[4:57:33] Midnight4life: No, early game you'll be fine, you want to bully him early normally.
[4:57:34] omgitsjason: yes
[4:57:38] jjoseneves: LUL
[4:57:38] omgitsjason: bully him early
[4:57:39] FluentZap: Don't let him stack his q on last hits if you can
[4:57:43] tyraell92: need to outplay him early on
[4:57:45] Tenethos: each time nasus goes for a stack, try to bully him a little
[4:57:47] soDugger: deny last hits
[4:57:53] omgitsjason: yes
[4:57:54] FluentZap: yeah
[4:57:55] Lemirith: Yup
[4:57:56] Daruvik: You're decent to go in against Nausus most of the time, very important to deny him minion farm. He scales up when he kills anything with his Q
[4:57:57] afreak10: ye
[4:57:58] tyraell92: or he becames a pain
[4:58:02] 14neo: isn't Nasus a crazy OP scaling hero thing? monkaSHAKE
[4:58:06] FluentZap: if you click on his you can see his stacks
[4:58:07] Papapwnage: yes the stick slap is his stacking mech
[4:58:08] lemoncrazedcamel: Every last hit with his q gives him stacks - stacks give damage and healing
[4:58:10] FluentZap: him*
[4:58:10] New_Kingg: hi
[4:58:11] Blueplzz: @rldennis oh wow cheers.
[4:58:14] omgitsjason: his q is just an empowered auto attack
[4:58:30] Price_FTW: he meant to deny Nasus last hits not your own JP
[4:58:35] danidude_o7: Nasus scaling is OP if he gets a lot of lats hits
[4:58:37] titanodin: deny NASUS's last hits LUL
[4:58:39] glennjamin23: He has passive lifesteal so he can heal up fast
[4:58:40] Papapwnage: 1.5 million my ass! Kappa
[4:58:48] drunkencpt: he just wants to lasthit with q to stack that dmg, just pushing him as good as you can
[4:58:49] Darkaros: @New_Kingg ijpHI
[4:58:49] Sovekz: Yes it's just an empowered aa that can potentially hit for 1k
[4:58:55] Darkaros: jp ward his jungle
[4:59:11] soDugger: actually doing a decnt job
[4:59:19] RJantara: ?
[4:59:20] Darkaros: you're sandbagging. miss abilities now, hit them later.
[4:59:20] Tenethos: dont let nasus freeze under tower, he shouldnt be allowed to free farm
[4:59:21] RlDennis: His Q permanently gets... 3? 6? damage for every unit he kills with Q. double for siege minions towers and champions
[4:59:29] glennjamin23: Blue buff KEKW
[4:59:30] spideycsa: corporate mundo goooo
[4:59:41] Papapwnage: corp mundo is a fantastic skin]

[4:59:59] Zhanrax72: cohhLurk
[5:00:15] glennjamin23: Their junlger definitely wants blue buff back
[5:00:18] Sovekz: Don't worry Nidalee, will help you leave lane soon
[5:00:30] lemoncrazedcamel: thats the wave to leave as it was stacked
[5:00:38] irminus: bami on base
[5:00:42] Papapwnage: you have enough for cinder already thats your first back goal
[5:00:42] RlDennis: He messed up his own farm there LUL
[5:00:47] Darkaros: PepoChamp JP be sure to make use of your blue buff by using more abilities /s

[5:01:14] afreak10: prob not
[5:01:17] RlDennis: Pog map awareness
[5:01:25] Mujona: He misses CS that way, and you want to try and get tower plates.
[5:01:25] spideycsa: you are making him miss a lot of last hits though
[5:01:33] RlDennis: Well, you see nidalee bot, so you could push in hard and then get a free back
[5:01:43] drunkencpt: bet thing is to create a slow push and make the wave come to your side
[5:01:53] drunkencpt: then freeze it ish by your tower so you can zone hi out of farm
[5:01:57] soDugger: if he stacks his q, he can start 1 shotting peopel
[5:02:00] FluentZap: he curved the briefcase LUL
[5:02:08] FluentZap: Like wanted
[5:02:17] Papapwnage: @FluentZap good movie
[5:02:17] afreak10: no ward at river
[5:02:24] SHOoOoOZAN: that is alot for 6 mins
[5:02:24] Darkaros: pepeJAM
[5:02:33] Joebeezer: canons give 12 stacks so beware!
[5:02:34] FluentZap: @Papapwnage Yeah underrated
[5:02:35] SHOoOoOZAN: if he gets 200 by 12
[5:03:01] Papapwnage: @FluentZap i like that main actor, he was great in last king of scotland too
[5:03:17] afreak10: they are busy bot
[5:03:30] lemoncrazedcamel: Tbh noc shoudl have been looking to dive pre six when you had the waved under his tower
[5:03:40] RlDennis: You kinda just need to take advantage of the fact he's using an ability on minions every time. Hard to do when you have no vision of jungle though
[5:03:49] SHOoOoOZAN: its very unique matchup, takes experience to know how to abuse him
[5:04:00] RlDennis: yeah
[5:04:15] Mujona: Getting tower plate gold when you have lane advantage is a huge thing in Top.
[5:04:18] zynessa: there's something uniquely satisfying about seeing those briefcase throws land
[5:04:23] jjoseneves: when you pick nasus enemy jungler will gank you 1000 times,when you are against a nasus your jg ignores your lane,thats a rule
[5:04:37] FluentZap: You cloud try to help get rift herald to take the tower and remove his farm?
[5:04:42] Papapwnage: yeah id take plates and forcing laner to back over kills these days in top for sure
[5:04:43] drunkencpt: @josephnorgate Then again jp is constantly psuhing, making it hard for noc to gank
[5:04:49] mayosilog: is swain a good support hero?
[5:04:57] soDugger: JGs who ignore Nasus are masochists
[5:04:58] Joebeezer: KEKW
[5:05:04] ワフルデラ: swain is a good support
[5:05:08] SHOoOoOZAN: is jp okay with backseat gaming?
[5:05:09] FluentZap: @mayo_on_rice Yeah swain can destroy if played right
[5:05:11] ワフルデラ: e is amazing
[5:05:14] FluentZap: Well he sued too
[5:05:19] RlDennis: @mayo_on_rice I'd say he's pretty good with an agressive/lane dominant adc like Draven
[5:05:21] jjoseneves: he is a mundo he can tank tower shots for a a dive
[5:05:27] glennjamin23: i think ur team can deal with nasus especially cuz of brand
[5:05:28] lemoncrazedcamel: @mayo_on_rice Hes not great but thats him just being a weak champion atm. Probably better support than anywhere else
[5:05:36] coomergmr: is jp becoming a league addict?
[5:05:55] jjoseneves: @drunkencpt there is a thing call dive,mundo ult can tank tower shots i guess
[5:06:12] Price_FTW: back to adc?
[5:06:18] afreak10: that's top
[5:06:19] FluentZap: Use your next tp to gank bot?
[5:06:20] tyraell92: search for opportunities with to
[5:06:21] Derdrom_TJM: if you push so hard then go roam
[5:06:21] Tenethos: Play someting that can carry?
[5:06:22] tyraell92: tp
[5:06:24] PedrowsB: any reason jp chose to learn top?
[5:06:24] glennjamin23: oh boi
[5:06:25] Derdrom_TJM: take jungle mobs
[5:06:25] lemoncrazedcamel: You need to shove and roam and look to tp to fights to turn them
[5:06:26] drunkencpt: @josephnorgate Ye, but nasus is tanky aswell, he needs a bigger wave to do that. stacking up a couple of waves at least
[5:06:27] Mujona: Push down the tower when ever you have minions tanking.
[5:06:36] Dredstryde: You have to work on pushing your advantage - taking plates without dying - getting herald that kinds of stuff
[5:06:39] ProxyClouds: Play a top carry?
[5:06:42] RlDennis: Shove and roam is something you need to learn as top to carry yeah
[5:06:44] KiDisaster: jungle controls the game. thats what i mained when i was trying to climb.
[5:06:45] Mortumee: look for offensive TPs botlane
[5:06:47] Papapwnage: You will never 1v9 in league anymore. No matter the lane if 2 other lanes lose your game is pretty set
[5:06:50] MrPogsin: top is literally an island
[5:06:51] Sstargamer: Saving tp for some ganks is usually a good option. Actually 200 stacks is pretty bad
[5:06:56] MrPogsin: jungle never be caring about top
[5:07:03] lemoncrazedcamel: @ProxyClouds This is the way, no reason to not play carries in silver
[5:07:17] Butttter: It’s hard to carry from top better of carrying from mid
[5:07:20] Joebeezer: answer for what?
[5:07:21] Kymix: ijpNODDERS
[5:07:22] Price_FTW: the answer is thats league baby
[5:07:23] Joebeezer: nasus?
[5:07:24] afreak10: its either ur team is good or shit :P
[5:07:31] zynessa: there's not a clean answer no :D
[5:07:33] SHOoOoOZAN: the answer is change champs
[5:07:34] drunkencpt: OH there is
[5:07:36] ワフルデラ: yeah I'd call a Pivot
[5:07:37] Price_FTW: sometimes you get a good team sometimes you get shit team
[5:07:38] slydown: @itmeJP it is the MMR you are at
[5:07:39] Sstargamer: top is kinda hamstrung by bad teammates
[5:07:39] Mayshar: Mayshar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[5:07:40] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Mayshar! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[5:07:42] SHOoOoOZAN: play quinn for example with ignite
[5:07:42] AinzN: Answers? modCheck
[5:07:43] problembarn89: kinda hard to gank when naut is sitting at turret, try auto less on mobs and force naut to come out
[5:07:45] mayosilog: maybe mid?
[5:07:48] SHOoOoOZAN: make plays on lvl 6
[5:07:57] StarPogPlatinum: KEKW
[5:07:59] Joebeezer: KEKW
[5:08:00] lemoncrazedcamel: You need to be more proactive on the amp imo. If you can look at your heatmap of this game you havent been anywhere but top lane
[5:08:01] Papapwnage: The answer is that its a team game. No matter where you are on the map you are not the reason a game is won. Maybe the reason its lost but it requires a team mindset
[5:08:02] drunkencpt: You're just having some meh wave managment by constant shoving, no times to invade enemy jlg, force dives or take herald
[5:08:02] morgath_: be more aggressive, you win every trade off right now
[5:08:04] danidude_o7: I think its more up the playstyle of the player whats best to do.
[5:08:05] epicshoo: ijpNODDERS
[5:08:05] DezartIII: Welp, if your team is losing consistently, and you aren't a carry, sitting top isn't gonna change the situation
[5:08:09] Dredstryde: When you push under the tower - go get herald
[5:08:09] vpopeprohladno: LUL
[5:08:10] TamboTv: the only thing is to roam from ur lane i guess, tp bot or something
[5:08:10] Dredstryde: Roam
[5:08:13] Notenoughcoffee: buckle up
[5:08:14] Dredstryde: Plant vision
[5:08:15] Mujona: The answer is to take tower fast if you have advantage then roam to other lanes to push down their towers. Then group with team after T1 towers are gone.
[5:08:16] Derdrom_TJM: You don't want to push the lane
[5:08:16] o0snipa0o: vs nasus I like to freez the lane and harass him so much he doesnt get xp or stacks. That draws the jungler top and gives my jungler time to gank bot or I can reverse kill the jg or top when he ganks
[5:08:21] 1sttimelurker: yeah sure
[5:08:22] Ryuushinn: freezing the lane instead of pushing under the tower would work better i think
[5:08:23] 14neo: Climate change monkaSHAKE
[5:08:36] epicshoo: KEKLEO
[5:08:40] Tenethos: you keep shobving, at least take the enemy jungle camps
[5:08:42] Price_FTW: emotes only monkaSHAKE
[5:08:43] glennjamin23: nid is ignoring top so maybe u can throw axes under his tower
[5:08:48] Launch619: The Great thunberg of top lane
[5:08:50] Tenethos: but pressure in jungle and mid then come back top
[5:08:51] WeeMr_Goodcat: just do the stuff
[5:08:52] a6314: emiMonka
[5:08:52] TamboTv: can freeze lane too
[5:08:53] Darkaros: HACKERMANS Gank his jungle HACKERMANS ward his roshan
[5:08:56] ワフルデラ: jail time hypeE
[5:09:02] Damarus914: Don't worry. They'll just blame you because you've "let" Nasus stack his Q. Doesn't matter that you've asked for help multiple times.
[5:09:14] o0snipa0o: 30£% tower dmg
[5:09:20] Tr3th0n: why tower dive so often
[5:09:28] jjoseneves: @Damarus914 thats so true
[5:09:33] holycaliburn: i like how u both get big lol
[5:09:39] FreedomRukus: TP to drag fight?
[5:09:39] SHOoOoOZAN: how is brand doing? he can destroy nasus
[5:09:40] FluentZap: Lol that was his first dive...
[5:09:43] Tenethos: or you can freeze lane on your half and wait for help
[5:09:43] Sstargamer: yeah that was a fine dive
[5:09:43] m3rcer: ijpKEK
[5:09:50] Tr3th0n: its not just this game :P
[5:09:53] Papapwnage: some of you guys got real guts to a man thats clearly tilted
[5:09:55] Tenethos: there is a lot of option and you are not playing towards it
