[1:14:46] DrewGamer: they are giga-inting...nothing you can do
[1:14:48] Rezz284: yeah ask if they wanna swap lanes
[1:15:00] Harakens: @insanitysbest just play and get experience. and watch pro players that are talkative about what they're doing and their mindset
[1:15:13] dudwasup: Don’t not not not not not die
[1:15:15] afreak10: Toxic yorick
[1:15:28] Lihapiiras: Quitting this game in 2013 was one of the best life decisions.
[1:15:29] titanodin: need to lane swap
[1:15:29] Nurama: Some games just arent winnable.
[1:15:31] AinzN: Is Yorick like WK from Dota 2?
[1:15:32] TheLeguard: you go next
[1:15:34] OhTenGeneral: Is that 7 for lux now?
[1:15:40] Nurama: Just like some games are basically impossible to lose
[1:15:45] titanodin: ask them to lane swap so they stop feeding
[1:15:51] Farnzy11: Lol they are being aggressive while down 47 kills. What a disaster bot lane
[1:16:04] DrewGamer: thornmail would help vs Yorick since he gets a lot of lifesteal with his Q
[1:16:04] Jukettaja: @AinzN Wraith King? Not really
[1:16:16] Timozuna: this game used to tilt me soo hard should try again sometime
[1:16:16] zipnox: shits falling apart real fast
[1:16:46] Jukettaja: Technically you could start playing support Tahm now since that's often his role anyway
[1:16:49] AinzN: Jukettaja yeah Wrath King. I just saw him summon like zombies is all and that's who I thought of
[1:16:51] Jukettaja: Deny those Lux kills with W
[1:16:56] Jukettaja: I mean R
[1:17:08] Dice_Slicer: This is why I switched from top to middle. And became a nomad LUL

[1:18:21] afreak10: yorick got free farm too
[1:18:24] FragSteve: Jukettaja he has little skelettons now
[1:18:24] Nurama: asdly yeah
[1:18:30] DrewGamer: krthus bot is just not a good pick either imo
[1:18:32] zynessa: @AinzN skellies
[1:18:42] titanodin: diana can carry if she isnt far behind i dunno what her score is
[1:18:50] OhTenGeneral: It's not great
[1:19:00] Jukettaja: Oh.
[1:19:01] OhTenGeneral: Graves is the only other one doing remotely well
[1:19:07] Jukettaja: Then maybe they are similar
[1:19:13] AinzN: Jukettaja when WK crits he get a summon stack and he can then summon a bunch of small skellies
[1:20:04] FluentZap: Once they are 0/2 you would think the bot would stop feeding...
[1:20:07] Elderjaked: welcome to league

[1:27:45] Brmbrmduc: "yeah just a billion today"
[1:27:49] ashla11: he probably has brokers on retainer to do that stuff for him
[1:27:50] GraveSalad: he put out a BS twitter poll to sell stocks despite having the options already on their strike date so he had to sell or pay interest anyways. He same-dayed them for the 11bil in taxes and then makes a big PR thing out of it...

[1:29:02] Sonatta: 1 billion in stock... 11 billion in taxes though... i wouldn't want to be Elon right now
[1:29:05] nKoalaBear: what is bad mood? lol
