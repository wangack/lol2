[0:56:20] Layercake: HahaThink At least you got some money from streaming NW right?
[0:56:23] RlDennis: BF 2042 seemed buggy as hell but also just kinda dumb fun cohhD
[0:56:38] Darkaros: @WassoWasso it's solid. i value the relationships in Persona games more than overall story so I didn't pay much attention; since your team is "established" (direct sequel to Persona 5 non-Royal), there's little char development cept for new chars
[0:56:41] i_revarm: bf2042  is  too much like a  bad cod  game for me
[0:56:46] Maklen5050: I love Rise, except the lack of end game. I fell off it hard compared to World
[0:56:48] Shoaron: world?
[0:56:49] GuacaWaka: can't wait for the 4k resolution pack on pc
[0:56:56] DucksVille: more Rise?
[0:56:57] zerohour_88: Monster Hunter do be like that, can't wait for PC version
[0:56:58] GraphismeGG: I won't upgrade my PC for this new BF game, to say the least

[0:57:23] kuronomiya: ijpNODDERS
[0:57:28] BlazeRom: Top Tier game
[0:57:30] Maklen5050: @ReginaldXIV that is what I am hoping. I have like 500 hours in World, I really want the expansion to add good end game
[0:57:33] zerohour_88: GOTG was 17 hours? that feels wrong, felt so much longer
[0:57:33] MysterGabe: Love me some Loop Hero

[1:00:07] Nickonil: lost ark was a YIKES for me
[1:00:07] thesestrangenotions: @darkaros that 100%. If anything season two even made the loop more restrictive.
[1:00:09] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!

[1:00:34] Shoaron: less tities
[1:00:35] Cronopolis: Censored costumes?
[1:00:37] Imagine42: censorship around outfits

[1:00:40] Elievex: censoring and npc race change
[1:00:40] SkywardRaven: that's misinfo
[1:00:41] Crome18: censoring of West version
[1:00:42] Nickonil: lost ark was in court, but they settled, so they release early @itmeJP
[1:00:44] DSpawn81: less tities and legs
[1:00:46] Onefootstout: adding diversity in skin tones and censorship
[1:00:48] frostwhispertx: They delayed the game like six months so that amazon could censor outfits
[1:00:48] Skyform: horny ppl upset that outfits aren't starter ones but you still can get them as white drops

[1:01:13] frostwhispertx: I mean it is stupid to be upset about that but it is even more stupid to censor it lol
[1:01:13] johnthegg: is it censorship if the outfits are still in the game? i'm confused
[1:01:13] frosht42: BOOBA

[1:27:00] Tobin: when do most trailers get released or is there no info on that?

[1:37:01] Mujona: I actively avoid any of that content.
[1:37:04] Shin_FielDGaR: it seems very temporary at least to me as a viewer came to twitch for games, react is fun for a while, but if there are no games I just forget about the stream after checking few times
[1:37:06] MrMontyHShah: @barrycarlyon sup Barry
[1:37:11] RlDennis: @BarryCarlyon Now I just want like a vicious cycle of people reacting to other people's content without consent and they just implode. cohhK

[1:37:33] Ribbons_Almark: but you're not playing a game right now Kappa
[1:37:35] CDubTheRIPper: i was watching a streamer a few days ago watching their top clips and they were pulling in more viewers then than when they were playing video games later that night
[1:37:38] Edot_KH: people realized why reality TV keeps working so well on broadcast TV...so they decided to do that on Twitch
[1:37:43] Turbologic: i wonder how twitch haven't take a place for the TV Shows
[1:37:44] Deathspate: The reality is that Twitch is just become "the livestream platform", not the "livestream gaming platform" like it was
[1:37:45] Friedolf: HypeSquawk we are special
[1:37:49] freetownJoe: Its weird to hear that from my bubble

[1:38:08] Korhazen: @CDubTheRIPper was it Burke?
[1:38:09] PallenTV: lirki maybe
[1:38:12] pc2400: so a streamer watching their old gameplay is better than their new gameplay KEKW
[1:38:14] TheWorstTimelime: there'll be a time when streamers will bring out the emergency hottub

[1:39:05] VrtniPatuljak: jesus
[1:39:05] MarleymanJ: :(
[1:39:05] Deathspate: @itmeJP I think part of the issue is that a lot of viewers are actually "background viewers", we don't have the stream on our main computer or is tabbed out, so just chatting just performs well for those
[1:39:06] palWonderdog: my bet is that streamers will just start watching other streamers as their content LUL
[1:39:07] Okkelsskov: @itmeJP do we know how much of the produced content on twitch is gaming and how much is other types?
