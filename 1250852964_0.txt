[2:11:17] yrvengalied: unmetal
[2:11:22] altizar: What no endwalker?
[2:11:23] aurice_heartly: BASS FISHING?
[2:11:27] Velthomer: GG clearly meant a lot to JP personally, hence the lack of FF guys.
[2:11:29] Dumt: Aw yeah. Unmetal.
[2:11:32] mayosilog: Unmetal Pog
[2:11:33] GymLeaderKevin: Love to see you run back some GG again @itmejp
[2:11:35] Imagine42: playing FF14 and streaming it are two very different things
[2:11:36] sscohen26: Listening to most streamers ffxiv sucks to stream at the beginning because most people dont watch to avoid spoilers
[2:11:37] Jiinglle: NODDERS
[2:11:41] BlaqExcellence: ijpTOTSUGEKI
[2:11:43] BoooFN: are they going to vote streamer of the year? cirAYAYA

[2:11:53] HahaHazer: Also a lot of people were very forward about streaming FF and the problems that come with it
[2:11:54] Fiendmaw: I think FF isn't on the list because it was very much expected and not as exciting as the other 3
[2:11:56] ObliviousToMe: Having the guy in stream was fun
[2:11:57] Wubsian: cirAYAYA
[2:12:01] GGuts: That boss battle achievement though KEKW

[2:12:08] Snowmancer: this one looked good
[2:12:12] ZeroDjinn: @sscohen26 describes me, I avoided all streamers that play FFXIV even if they're variety until I finished the MSQ
[2:12:18] BaosilisK: @Fiendmaw it makes sense right
[2:12:28] bansheehero: Was there a community vote for this?
[2:12:33] bakavic: I'd imagine streaming endwalker would be a pain due to spoilers and how some in chat think they are clever in trying to talk around spoilers
[2:12:34] CDubTheRIPper: monkaW
[2:12:38] Darkaros: There was a top 3 games watched for the community
[2:12:51] Fiendmaw: @BaosilisK SQEX has a good formula but a formula nonetheless
[2:12:52] bansheehero: thanks @Darkaros

[2:13:12] Altair900: DeSRE is so good
