[0:46:34] jaypretorius: And the Hawaiin shirt
[0:46:35] HooverFan: also, as the directors said, he doesn't have the power he once had after being wiped for 5 years, he's having to build back up his crew and influence... so he HAS to take things into his own hands

[0:47:39] Cephyric: The entire end scene with him and Echo was straight from 1 of the Matt Fraction comics, right? She straight up shot him in the face but he's all good
[0:47:45] AnorienNightwish: ijpHI JP, Bronze, Jesse and chat

[0:47:57] HooverFan: she blinded kingpin
[0:47:59] Barrh: i think the hard thing is that people will always thing of the netflix versions when the only thing that is the same is the actors
[0:48:05] KosmicKing78: He didn't have the same presence as Netflix, he was smaller as well... also I think we forget he is almost 10 years older than when filming Daredevil.. it was just weird
[0:48:07] prfella: @cephyric and he was just blinded for a while
[0:48:15] jeffhunter12: I loved how they are really just making it clear that hawkeye is mentally just broken
[0:48:17] Malanor85: talking Kingpin is scary
[0:48:21] EvilBuho: @Poobzee , well it sure wasn't acting the same way so there is a chance it actually not and he just said that. (Usually actors don't know all of the details for narratives)  @KiddouJanse  that was dumb for sure lol @prfella yeah, I wonder if we are going to get a daredevil reboot from it with same characters lol
[0:48:52] Redhulk05: after the next thor  movie i think marvel is done

[0:49:08] IronFistOfChina: he wear bulletproof suits
[0:49:11] Hikyy: that car door too
[0:49:13] HooverFan: remember from daredevil that he ALWAYS has armor woven into his suits

[0:53:27] WDForty: it's a "those in the know" treat
[0:53:27] Reijm11: All she killed was in self defence because they were all trying to kill her as well
[0:53:29] Craylith: Yeah, she wasn´t just an agent. She was Mockingbird.

[1:00:55] SZebra: Yup
[1:01:12] Reijm11: Its not like he was killing random people though, it was defending people from a group of armed attackers
[1:01:34] LFC_Letters: @Snerkadoodle theres a gag reel on Disney+ on him in a prisoner outfit
[1:01:57] tkcross21: swordsman in the street makes more sense than a giant hand from the ocean
[1:01:58] Snerkadoodle: @LFC_Letters  I shall check it out! thanks

[1:03:21] 0GHammer: they were being ignored cause they were dressed like waiters and waitresses
[1:03:21] Craylith: @itmejp The point was that because of the super heroes people are so conditioned to only listen to people in costumes.
[1:03:25] Cephyric: Yeah but if you think about it when they are at their normal jobs they have outfits on,, which people are "trained" to listen to in emergency situations
[1:03:28] sgtshmoo: it was Disney giving homage to all the first responder heroes.

[1:10:47] prfella: 6 i think
[1:10:55] HooverFan: it was SUPPOSED to be 8, but start of covid cut it down
[1:10:57] zeroncali: Ive felt like every one of these Disney+ shows could have used another episode or 2.
[1:10:59] Sckellethon: yea
[1:11:00] SlipCrit: didnt they say they werent rewritten?
[1:11:00] Snerkadoodle: all been 6

[1:11:32] prfella: only wandavision wasnt 6 but episodes were shprter
[1:11:33] KingEnigma620: Disney+ needs to do the right thing.....make new seasons of Gargoyles

[1:11:36] Frost0555: WandaVision had 9 episodes
[1:11:39] drowzeya: Just less going on
[1:11:43] Jackelope: Hawkeye felt by far the most empty
[1:11:44] reallyafr: they announced all disney+ marvel shows would be 6 45 min or 9 25 min
[1:11:47] Sckellethon: what if was 8 but 30 mins

[1:12:43] Sonatta: the shows are not required watching
[1:12:44] AnorienNightwish: @itmeJP Wanda and What if - 9, Falcon, Loki and Hawkeye - 6
[1:12:45] Zethgryn: Loki was set up to have a Season 2 tho i think, so it was meant to have cliff hangers

[1:13:01] MasqureMan: @snerkadoodle 1 episode
[1:13:04] Frost0555: @snerkadoodle 2
[1:13:12] prfella: @masqureman it was 2
[1:13:15] pc2400: maybe the westview part is just in the trailer like they cut stuff from trailers to movies
[1:13:36] Ebon_Sky: wanda had 9, yah
[1:13:38] LFC_Letters: Yeah the Westview could just be a trailer thing
[1:13:41] Frost0555: @stalker2400 but why tho would they do that
[1:13:49] Tronix_604: Wandavision introduced Rambeau who will be a big part of Marvels
[1:13:59] Cephyric: They haven't made any reference to FATWS in any of the moveis so far, and unless they do that's gonna be some jarring change of pace for movie only watchers with Captain America 4
[1:14:00] ExDual: did they talk about spider man?
[1:14:11] Darkaros: Spooder Man was discussed last week
[1:14:13] Olegregg88: on the previous podcast they did
[1:14:14] Sathias: @ExDual Two weeks ago
[1:14:20] LFC_Letters: @ExDual last episode
[1:14:25] prfella: @exdual yes 2weeks ago
[1:14:39] MasqureMan: They could have just resolved Echo’s stuff in the 5th episode, or given it one more episode
[1:14:39] sch1z0: hawkeye started good
[1:14:42] Poobzee: @Cephyric not at all. you end Endgame with Falcon getting the shield. so you expect him being Cap
[1:14:43] WDForty: the MCU seems to do a lot better the more fantastical things get
[1:15:02] BlueSapphyre: @Cephyric endgame ended with steve giving him the shield tho.
[1:15:04] Frost0555: I loved all the Kate/Yelena scenes on the entire show
[1:15:19] LFC_Letters: If they nailed the finale its probably the best MCU show so far
[1:15:21] Olegregg88: Can we just get a Kate/Yelena buddy cop movie?
[1:15:29] WDForty: the more "realistic" settings seem to not land as well cause they're superheros trying to fit into a non-powered setting
[1:15:31] Snerkadoodle: @WDForty  I agree altho my favouritt movie is winter soldier
[1:15:34] Cephyric: Poobzee There's an awful lot of yada yada going on though if you don't have the FATWS story in between. He got the shield and then suddenly the next time you see him he's falcon-america
[1:15:41] Holrend: i dont know what they will do with Echo show
[1:15:42] Frost0555: Dat post credits scene tho LUL
[1:15:46] Derpshadou: It was bad lol
[1:15:49] Bitghost_: it was a bit long for a goof
[1:15:50] Aurugorn: Marvel has trained us to expect teases tbh
[1:15:51] DejaDrew: I fully expected hawkeye to be terrible
[1:15:59] jmj1987: NODDERS
[1:16:00] Barrh: it was from the scenes in the first episode they just shot the whole thing
[1:16:00] kazen01: it was goofy
[1:16:01] m3rcer: i just wanted like a camera cut to any character having fun watching it
[1:16:02] m3rcer: thats it
[1:16:15] m3rcer: instead it was just the musical KEKW
[1:16:17] Snarkybaboon: of it consuming the people in the car? lol
[1:16:18] MasqureMan: I think they only shot the one musical scene and they just showed the entire song
[1:16:21] Poobzee: @Cephyric yeah its just more context and appreciation. but its not required. he was given the shield, so its not confusing seeing him be CAp
[1:16:23] Devlind: the post credit scene was soooo bad. Did not do it for me
[1:16:26] Tronix_604: Scott Lang wasnt even in the battle for new york the musical was bad and fake news LUL
[1:16:27] InternetPlumber: I thought the play was great
[1:16:28] jeffhunter12: i was
[1:16:29] WDForty: the post-post-scene a lot of the time are just fun stuff
[1:16:30] Sir_Myrmidon: so are those two dudes owl food - or do the pym particles wear off?
[1:16:31] ExDual: worst credit scene by far LUL
[1:16:32] IronFistOfChina: I was
[1:16:37] scar3cr0w79: it was very long the musical bit. couldn't tell if it was a joke or not
[1:16:39] Barrh: i liked it LUL
[1:16:55] Cephyric: Poobzee My parents refuse to buy Disney+, and I guarantee you they'll not connect the dots between endgame and CA4
[1:17:01] m3rcer: even the cap one about expectations or patience was better imo KEKW
[1:17:04] epicshoo: pepeBASSHD
[1:17:05] normalnaut: It felt like a parody of Broadway musicals
[1:17:06] ExDual: LUL
[1:17:13] WDForty: it was a fun number, nothing to take seriously
[1:17:15] sch1z0: LUL
[1:17:26] Frost0555: I saw some people say the entire musical could be on youtubd instead of a post credits scene.
[1:17:28] Legionnare92: thanks i hate it
[1:17:30] SgtStruthers: That show will be at the park this year zekeKEK
[1:17:35] Poobzee: @Cephyric idk what to tell you man, thats on them
[1:17:37] IronFistOfChina: Really?? I have you met New Torkers
[1:17:40] Tr0nc3k: it's stinks but it's a familiar stink they love, get used to
[1:17:47] Ozryel626: Can’t tell if dining Hulk is satire…
[1:17:49] MasqureMan: It’s satire
[1:17:56] BitTrippn: It's a throwaway gag, ffs
[1:17:58] scar3cr0w79: plus they already showed it once right? the beginning of the show, that small part of the musical, that was good i think
[1:18:02] Redvelvet84: i only finished watching that expecting something to come after
[1:18:02] MasqureMan: Like how they threw antman in there
[1:18:27] Cephyric: Poobzee Sure, but I generally attribute how my parents consume movies to how the general audience does, which is why I am convinced it'll be weirdly jarring with no reference to Falcon being the new CA
[1:18:31] Frost0555: @redvelvet84 PepeLaugh and then...
[1:18:34] Brandling: Hyperanalyzing jokes NotLikeThis
[1:18:34] windgod2000: The best Christmas Carol version and ill fight anyone that says otherwise
[1:18:35] ExDual: LUL
[1:18:36] InternetPlumber: top 5 Christmas movie
[1:18:42] LaserGuidedLuv: I bought that vinyl for my husband for Christmas. we love it
[1:18:48] Tyronin: ive never seen it lol
[1:18:50] Bitghost_: Muppets always goes hard
[1:18:55] windgod2000: Michael Caine just delivers
[1:19:10] sgtshmoo: its number 2 after Die Hard for Christmas movies!
[1:19:19] Sonatta: Mickey's Christmas Carol is the one I grew up on NODDERS
[1:19:20] jeffhunter12: i thought it was good
[1:19:22] MasqureMan: I used to watch muppets in space lmao
[1:19:23] JosieSprings: Michael Caine acts the hell out of that film
[1:19:28] Poobzee: @Cephyric and if you spoonfeed information the narrative is stale
[1:19:30] SgtStruthers: Why was Antman there?
[1:19:34] prfella: @cephyric if they watch endgame ending. and then cap 4, thry will connect. sam literally says I will try to live up to cap while holding the shiekd
[1:19:39] SKEWR13: I loved Pigs in Space
[1:19:55] ExDual: i'm gonna have to check that out
[1:20:03] CapnStubing: The Muppets sang Kokomo.  A song that literally has the lyric "Afternoon Delight" in it.  They give 0 fucks.
[1:20:05] jeffhunter12: yeah i was hoping for a crowd reveal
[1:20:12] Cephyric: Poobzee You don't need to spoonfeed narrative to have some general reference to "Oh have you seen the new Captain America?" in 1 of the movies to at least connec it
[1:20:15] m3rcer: yep i just wanted any character to be in the audience
[1:20:24] Redhulk05: the muppet movie was the best
[1:20:39] Frost0555: I the entire scene was the same from episode one just not showing Clint and his family
[1:20:43] MasqureMan: Ant man is the new mephisto?
[1:20:56] Cephyric: prfella My parents aren't going to rewatch Endgame in prep for CA4, and there's gonna have been like 5 years between those movies
[1:21:09] Brandling: "Rogers", starring Hawkeye.
[1:21:09] Ravnim: hawkeye but it's Mr Cellophane would have been dope
[1:21:11] Aurugorn: the guy who made it I think
[1:21:14] MrMX0121: The director of the musicle
[1:21:14] PariahPaladin: The conductor?
[1:21:18] Poobzee: @Cephyric which you can do within the movie itself with a single throwaway line
[1:21:21] WDForty: conductor i think
[1:21:25] IronFistOfChina: He's a famous director
[1:21:27] ExDual: i was just like of course disney makes another musical boonDesk
[1:21:31] WDForty: oh
[1:21:31] MasqureMan: It’s just like the schwarma scene, just fun stuff
[1:21:35] Redhulk05: get ready for x-men and fantastic four
[1:21:37] prfella: @cephyric cap 4 will for sure do a recap at the beginning
[1:21:39] BrannonCannon: Does Clint’s wife being Agent 13/Mockingbird affect any future projects or just an Easter egg? @itmejp
[1:21:41] sch1z0: hawkeye felt the most like the neflix marvel shows
[1:22:03] BlueSapphyre: @BrannonCannon agent 19.
[1:22:24] m3rcer: ALIENS
[1:22:26] Snerkadoodle: i was expecting to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus character sitting in the audience
[1:22:28] leovic1: LUL
[1:22:31] m3rcer: IT WAS THE GODDAMN ALIENS
[1:22:37] sch1z0: KEKW
[1:22:39] Shoujogirl918: its always aliens
[1:22:39] Redhulk05: Godzilla
[1:22:45] Frost0555: D:
[1:22:47] Poobzee: "the war was over"
[1:22:48] JimB0b0: I mean, they did tho
[1:22:48] ErikOO7: influencers just cant enjoy something thats fun. they have to give the hot take and find reasons to hate it.
[1:22:50] Jackelope: That's CW as shit
[1:22:51] ExDual: KEKW
[1:23:05] IronFistOfChina: It's true though
[1:23:08] MasqureMan: Don’t deny her truth
[1:23:09] prfella: "when i was a kid the fire nation attacked"
[1:23:09] xyzlime: u=im ean, how else would u say it?
[1:23:09] Reijm11: You guys relate the show to much to our own world
[1:23:17] Zandivya: So when do we get a Muppets Avengers movie ijpCHEER
[1:23:19] m3rcer: tbf in the world it wouldnt be campy or weird
[1:23:21] ワフルデラ: "when I was a kid a purple man came from space with a gauntlet"
[1:23:33] m3rcer: like this world went tru alien invasion and the snap
[1:23:44] BlueSapphyre: when i was kid, a giant space man came out of the planet.
[1:23:45] CorporalPibb: no one would start a conversation like that and not be seen as crazy
[1:23:45] JumpTroopC5: @itmejp I think as we get more and more writers and directors involved with marvel, or any property, on something like Disney+ you will get more varying opinions of what a marvel show should be. Some shows will hit with some people but miss with others.
[1:23:49] Redhulk05: world war hulk please
[1:23:53] kazen01: cant wait for the giant spacemen talks
[1:24:02] m3rcer: @CorporalPibb in the MCU world tho?
[1:24:02] Ozryel626: It’s like some 18 year old saying when I was a kid there was a global pandemic that lasted four years…MCU is weird, imagine living in it as a non superhero
[1:24:05] Jackelope: She's not bad, but she's luke warm to me
[1:24:05] ExDual: NODDERS
[1:24:14] sch1z0: YEP
[1:24:33] CorporalPibb: @CorporalPibb apparently?
[1:24:35] Jackelope: Her banter with Yelena was great, but Florence overshadows her performance so much she steals the scenes.
[1:25:01] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[1:25:04] xyzlime: she technically didnt burn her apartment down
[1:25:17] MasqureMan: “Is this what heroes do? Arrest their mom on Christmas?”
[1:25:20] m3rcer: @CorporalPibb i mean everyone knows aliens exist and half the world got blipped away. saying casually that yeah aliens when i was young is probably normal
[1:25:23] Velthomer: yeah, idk how anyone can relate to kate bishop.
[1:25:33] Cephyric: xyzlime She caused the chain of events that led to her apartment being burnt down
[1:25:35] Reijm11: More likely that she does not have friends
[1:25:37] ThemDemo: I imagine we will get more character development for Kate for the next roughly 10 years of seeing this her in the MCU
[1:25:39] JimB0b0: Iwouldn't say selfish. I would say lonely
[1:25:50] BlackholeYeti: yea thats a "i live alone" thing
[1:25:52] xelan_star: she is a loner
[1:25:55] Frost0555: @themdemo No doubt
[1:25:55] BlackholeYeti: ask me how i know
[1:26:05] MasqureMan: It’s not selfish, she doesn’t have people over
[1:26:20] Snerkadoodle: @blackholeyeti  How do you know ? :P
[1:26:22] drowzeya: But were they friends or just the people she hung with?
[1:26:25] Holrend: is the school was in an another city?
[1:26:26] sgtshmoo: you mean she's like pre iron man to y then?!!
[1:26:26] Altair900: she is a loner, her friends left her after that clocktower incident
[1:26:28] xyzlime: @Cephyric true
[1:26:42] avgrojm: not selfish, selfcentered
[1:26:57] jaypretorius: @Miscobob thats the same KEKW
[1:27:01] Velthomer: @Miscobob what do you think selfish means??
[1:27:08] avgrojm: not really
[1:27:15] jeffhunter12: It really wasnt
[1:27:16] prfella: yes lol
[1:27:18] BlackholeYeti: @Snerkadoodle one of my many friends told me, clearly
[1:27:30] Barrh: they both had to accept that she is gone
[1:27:30] ThemDemo: He came to terms with what he did as Ronin in Endgame IMO
[1:27:36] Snerkadoodle: @blackholeyeti  Offcourse...my bad =)
[1:27:45] prfella: @blackholeyeti Larper did right? Kappa
[1:27:55] SZebra: @jaypretorius Nah, there's a subtle difference. Self-centered is to see things only in terms of how it affects you first, whereas selfish is to make decisions based on what's best for you and only you.
[1:27:58] Jackelope: I don't know if I was ever going to get much out of a show about my least favor avenger lol
[1:27:58] ashrifts: no on cam
[1:28:00] 0GHammer: he already tried
[1:28:01] ashrifts: not*
[1:28:02] Reijm11: Clint i think already accepts his past, he was already a killer before that anyway and he only killed bad people
[1:28:06] NixonNarwhal: winter soldier 2 clint boogaloo
[1:28:10] scar3cr0w79: what about that talk about "these are the last "special" arrows ever"... why did they mention that? will it have any follow up with that?
[1:28:15] nijntuu: he and his wife know and accept what he has done
[1:28:16] jaypretorius: @SZebra to me its the same
[1:28:17] Velthomer: I just did a bad thing oopsie KEKW
[1:28:21] Poobzee: he tried in endgame
[1:28:22] MasqureMan: I think they did it well. He accepted that he both has killed people but he also inspired a new generation
[1:28:34] Frost0555: Every time the Endgame music from the scene where Natasha sacrifices herself came on PepeHands
[1:28:47] Wildskunk: hawkeye should have sacrificed himself fighting kingpin
[1:29:09] SZebra: @jaypretorius A self-centered person can be altruistic so long as thinking of themselves isn't the *only* part of their decision making process. A selfish person cannot.
[1:29:12] Jackelope: Overall, the show suffers from very low stakes
[1:29:15] Cephyric: scar3cr0w79 A bunch of the trick arrows were stark-tech, which he doesn't exactly have easy access to anymore
[1:29:22] DrTazerFace: The big reveals fell flat for me. Kingpin and the watch didn’t hit like finding out the TVA was controlled by Kang imo
[1:29:50] Dutch_Tuchd: The only Avengers who aren't people who have killed are Antman, Vision, and Spiderman.
[1:30:01] Munetani_NJimha: Also why the f did they want that watch?
[1:30:04] javybavy: The Echo show might just be an introduction to MCU Daredevil
[1:30:05] Munetani_NJimha: We never learned
[1:30:05] Zethgryn: i bet echo will be cancelled
[1:30:15] LFC_Letters: Kingpin is gonna have to carry that show
[1:30:23] sch1z0: @SarcasticFiend true i watched netflix marvel shows and was like oh ok
[1:30:26] Frost0555: You guys think ECHO will be 6 episodes aswell?
[1:30:32] MasqureMan: She was equal with Hawkeye every fight
[1:30:37] prfella: @dutch_tuchd spiderman killed aliens KEKW
[1:30:39] Jackelope: Echo will have to be a platform to introduce something else in the MCU
[1:30:42] nijntuu: only way for her to have a show is if it is a daredevil kingpin series. they just needed a name before they showed them
[1:30:42] Ravnim: hawkeye gaslit her LUL
[1:30:42] Snerkadoodle: @Jaybav Aren't they saving him for shehulk?
[1:30:47] Cephyric: Dutch_Tuchd Vision was a part of Age of Ultron - the group responsible for destroying an entire nation, so would say he has killed people
[1:30:51] ExDual: that's what i thought!
[1:30:52] BlueSapphyre: @Dutch_Tuchd p sure ant-man killed darren cross.
[1:30:52] SZebra: @Jackelope *skrulls*
[1:30:53] Barrh: they are just weapons to be pointed
[1:30:59] Poobzee: i think Echo's show will be like DD cleaning up the crime business
[1:31:02] javybavy: @Snerkadoodle No idea lol I'm just thinking of ways that the Echo show will actually be interesting
[1:31:10] Tr0nc3k: she already wants to kill clint
[1:31:21] br4nd0nh347: ronin, just the weapon
[1:31:23] MasqureMan: She did try to kill Hawkeye, but Kate saved him in that moment
[1:31:25] Tr0nc3k: still wants to I mean
[1:31:39] Reijm11: Ronan defeated her and told her she would die if she comes after her
[1:31:44] Snerkadoodle: @Jaybav  yea good point...i have no idea on how that show will be interesting..maby if she gets hunted my kingpin but still
[1:31:45] Dutch_Tuchd: K... I guess Avenging just involves murder.
[1:32:07] ThemDemo: I don't think Kazi is dead he will probably show up again in Echo
[1:32:13] Tapar: I understand that, one of my best friends stole from me and it was SO much worse because of the betrayal
[1:32:19] BitTrippn: She knowswhat kind of guy Kingpin is though, It's NOT a stretch
[1:32:23] BlueSapphyre: 100% comic book nods.
[1:32:23] Zethgryn: i can't believe she forgave Kazi and wanted to run away with him
[1:32:25] Poobzee: @ThemDemo you saw him die
[1:32:33] spideycsa: pizza dog
[1:32:34] Jackelope: *gasp* never
[1:32:37] sgtshmoo: hey they got to the right conclusion
[1:32:40] Tyronin: pizza dog
[1:32:44] Shin_gx: comic book nodders NODDERS
[1:32:51] MasqureMan: Well the man who raised her had her dad killed
[1:32:54] Zrmi: It's based on Die Hard kinda movies.. I mean logic was out of the book from the beginning
[1:33:00] Ravnim: the flicking the coin thing is also a nod to comic
[1:33:03] sch1z0: monkaHmm
[1:33:07] Reijm11: Kingpin betraying her is much worse
[1:33:11] Ozryel626: Damn this series based on a comic book character using the comic books as source material
[1:33:20] BitTrippn: She's a killer for hire, too. She understands the dynamic. It's not Clint's fault
[1:33:22] kazen01: the show is based on the matt fraction comic
[1:33:27] Reijm11: he is introduced as her uncle
[1:33:33] Redhulk05: crapping on marvel shows
[1:33:44] Barrh: kazi said it was supposed to him next in line, but she got the lead
[1:33:48] itmeJP: chat some of you are insufferable lol
[1:33:52] Redhulk05: go watch the trainwreck called DC
[1:33:53] Cephyric: Ozryel626 There's a difference between being true to source material, and putting something in there specifically just to be like "hey look, this is from the source material!"
[1:33:54] Heisuisui: LUL
[1:34:04] Wildskunk: D:
[1:34:11] ThemDemo: They aren't crapping on it, being critical shows how much they love this universe
[1:34:21] spirouac: too bad punisher didn't show up and murder them all for minor misdemeanors
[1:34:26] nijntuu: kingpin felt a bit like ralph boner to me
[1:34:28] Redhulk05: AGREE
[1:34:32] Frost0555: @spirouac D:
[1:34:44] IToldYouItsTaken: it really didn't need to be so inconsistent, it really does feel like there's some episodes missing
[1:34:48] Zrmi: The whole Yelena trying to 'kill' Clint was super weak also
[1:34:50] sunbeamEU: he had the speech about the angry blind weapon
[1:34:51] MasqureMan: They’re fair points, i just disagree with some of the character analysis. Agree to disagree
[1:34:53] smurfingsmurfer: they are all just pawns for kingpin
[1:34:53] Reijm11: thats 2 difference scenes though
[1:34:54] Snerkadoodle: We know they are gonna be super critical...thats why we are here to watch them :P  me atleast

[1:35:22] Cephyric: Echo episode 1 - Surprise, it's a Kingpin show!
[1:35:23] SZebra: Bullseye shoots the gun out of her hand to protect Kingpin.
[1:35:24] BitTrippn: They should, nobody wants to watch a show with her anyway
[1:35:25] zynessa: Shoot her and have the nurse from Daredevil save her NODDERS
[1:35:26] Zrmi: In the comic Kingpin got shot.. but wont spoiler what happens to him
[1:35:27] Sir_Myrmidon: shoot echo and make the show about dare devil
[1:35:33] Altair900: People can live through gunshots. Hes not gonna kill her and Kingpin isnt going to die either.
[1:35:38] ExDual: @Redhulk05 it's just a emote nodding in agreement

[1:36:54] IronFistOfChina: I don't think it still adds up, but betrayal can be worse than random acts of evil against you
[1:37:05] Lord_Beardmeister: NODDERS
[1:37:07] JBfromAccounting: Deaf & Amputee actress... and it's her first role ever, they would get destroyed in the news
[1:37:09] MasqureMan: Why would they cancel a new show for another shows writing
[1:37:35] SZebra: Are there any shows between now and Echo's release?

[1:38:34] Redhulk05: echo what echo
[1:38:43] Velthomer: echo is not a strong enough character to carry a whole show
[1:38:50] BlueSapphyre: echo was only in it to lead to her show.

[1:40:54] Devlind: anyone have a link to an updated release Schedule of all disney stuff?
[1:41:00] Altair900: I dont think we know what this phase is still till Doctor Strange, just saying
[1:41:00] pc2400: whats the next show coming?
[1:41:01] Jackelope: Unrelated, but have they spoken at all about a Jessica Jones return to MCU?
[1:41:07] IToldYouItsTaken: they jammed like 4 major plotlines into 6 episodes lol
[1:41:10] Malanor85: Brooding: The Show
[1:41:15] kazen01: yea they kind of put echo in front of a hawkeye show
[1:41:15] Zrmi: @Jackelope nope
[1:41:15] Redhulk05: there is reason why  Disney head and Kevin f are having issues
[1:41:16] ExDual: @Jackelope nothing so far BibleThump
[1:41:22] scar3cr0w79: lots of brooding I'd assume
[1:41:29] WayneG947: Sounds like Nick Cage Ghost Rider

[1:42:01] Zethgryn: Echo is a skrull, confirmed
[1:42:06] SpaceDive: vibranium
[1:42:09] Redvelvet84: if your not that in with the comics doubt you even know she was a special character.

[1:42:21] Nyaronya: KEKW
[1:42:25] Tyronin: @itmeJP do you have a link to the most updated mcu release schedule
[1:42:27] Altair900: I think youre setting expectations of the watch too high
[1:42:35] BlueSapphyre: AoS mockingbird was badass.
[1:42:42] Cephyric: AoS not MCU canon D:
[1:42:44] Sir_Myrmidon: yeah AoS mockingbird was pretty good
[1:42:48] IronFistOfChina: I agree that the watch was an awful execution, but the watch was a die hard reference
[1:42:50] pc2400: good actress Kreygasm
[1:42:59] MasqureMan: Agents of shield is the best thing no one cares about
[1:43:05] ReginaldXIV: Isn't Ali Larter a racist?
[1:43:13] Zrmi: @MasqureMan maybe it was for 2 seasons...
[1:43:15] Frost0555: AoS spinoff called Most Wanted I remember PepeHands
[1:43:18] vashaun: didnt sam jackson appear on aos?
[1:43:20] MaStAmUd: AoS was good
[1:43:23] scar3cr0w79: True she was a good mockingbird actually
[1:43:26] SZebra: @ReginaldXIV It wasn't Ali Larter. IIRC
[1:43:29] Craylith: @itmeJP THat doesn´t work. AoS was part of Winter Soldier and Avegers 2
[1:43:30] jeffhunter12: booooo
[1:43:34] Frost0555: @reginaldxiv Whos talking about ali larter
[1:43:34] zerohour_88: RIP 1 hour podcast Sadge

[1:43:37] Malanor85: Solid 1 Hour
[1:43:40] TheArgentGod: no more 3 hour 1 hour podcasts?
[1:43:41] ItsSchulz: I mean, they never call either character Mockingbird in both shows, and the "Mockingbird" moniker can just be Shield's answer to the widow program.
[1:43:48] ReginaldXIV: Oh I'm mixing two actresses up
[1:43:50] Zrmi: Cant wait for Eternals to be watchable on D+ in a few weeks

[1:44:17] drewchick4: @jeffhunter12 they talked about it during spider man talk
[1:44:17] ThemDemo: I think we get a Moon Knight trailer before Book of Boba Fett is over
[1:44:18] AnorienNightwish: @reallyafr Adrianne Palicki was the the actor that played Mockingbird in AoS
[1:44:22] Cephyric: Craylith What of AoS was actually overtly referenced in those movies? The show referencing the movies doesn't make it MCU canon, otherwise DD and such would be
[1:44:27] MaStAmUd: morbious?
[1:44:30] jeffhunter12: @drewchick4 ah okay
[1:44:30] Snerkadoodle: @Olf_Himself  ahh yea right

[1:44:59] ControllerZen: I'm looking forward to Morbius. The film should introduce Blade

[1:45:25] El_Zilcho22: Vulture no longer know Peter Parker is Spider-Man
[1:45:25] kazen01: the tie in
[1:45:34] Cephyric: I didn't watch the video I saw the title about, but is there something about Morbius actuallly being in Andrew Garfields universe?
[1:45:35] Devlind: I still have to see the new spiderman movie
[1:45:36] Jackelope: That CGI looks dogshit bad
[1:45:39] Craylith: @Cephyric The whole first season of AoS revolved around what happened in Winter Soldier. And the Heli Carrier that shows up at the end of Avengers 2 was repaired/staffed by the main character of AoS
[1:45:46] Muvova: Can noone stream guardians of the galaxy?  I dont see anyone streaming it
[1:45:47] Poobzee: i bet that's Vulture only appearance in Morbius. bet

[1:46:23] Jackelope: Depends on where you live
[1:46:23] Redvelvet84: theaters closed... >.<
[1:46:24] vashaun: what if blade shows up in morbius?
[1:46:24] Cephyric: Craylith That's not the movies referencing the show though, that's the show referencing the movies
[1:46:25] Poobzee: Harley Quinn & Friends
[1:46:26] Redhulk05: sony is setting up sinister six vs spiderman venom and morphis

[1:46:26] SlipCrit: that was the first name
[1:46:27] Altair900: they were

[1:46:56] Redhulk05: garbage
[1:46:59] ReginaldXIV: It's a good vehicle for Black Canary
[1:47:02] Lihapiiras: Watch the Harley Quinn cartoon
[1:47:03] Muvova: @Shin_gx no the game.
[1:47:03] Craylith: @Cephyric But that makes them part of the same univers as the movies/MCU. So it can´t be the Multiverse which is what JP was saying.
[1:47:08] MrMX0121: It got action by the John Wick director, so what not too like about it.
[1:47:09] SlipCrit: @Snerkadoodle now thats a fuckign lie
[1:47:09] JosieSprings: Yeah

[1:52:01] Skyform: yea they made cyborg a real character in snyder cut
[1:52:01] leovic1: NODDERS
[1:52:04] Zrmi: The 4 hours are cut in chapters so you can watch chapters of it
[1:52:07] GrannySith: The DCEU Crew NODDERS
[1:52:08] Snerkadoodle: @MasqureMan yea 3 hours would be fine
[1:52:10] m3rcer: that became a gag cause supes just carries a building
[1:52:14] br4nd0nh347: @masqureman actually it should, too many characters
[1:52:15] MrMX0121: IMAX aspect ratio
[1:52:17] Shin_gx: it's 4:3 yeah
[1:52:20] InternetPlumber: its open matte not 4x3
[1:52:23] Frost0555: @magnacarter_ We are very diferent lol I watched it twice
[1:52:28] DeusSilvam: You can watch it in parts
[1:52:31] eridani3: 1990's resolution KEKW
[1:52:31] Altair900: Thats an FOV / stretching thing.
[1:52:41] MrMX0121: Doesn't look weird if you watch it in a dark room.
[1:52:42] epicshoo: KEKLEO
[1:52:42] KahunaKona: Zoomer vision lol
[1:52:45] SabertoothEwok: The weird Aquaman religion killed tha movie for me
[1:52:46] ApathyOwl: it'll just be black bars on the left/right rather than top/bottom
[1:52:46] EvoCaliber: LUL
[1:52:48] Cephyric: Some TVs auto stretch 4:3 aspect ratio, you have to turn it off in settings
[1:52:54] ThemDemo: The Snyder cut did only one thing for me, it told me that WB should have taken their time to do individual movies for all the characters before the team up movie.
[1:52:57] Sonatta: i don't get how it's released in 4x3.... like how was it filmed?
[1:53:03] SZebra: Or a huge great projector
[1:53:12] InternetPlumber: it was filmed in imax, its jut not cropped
[1:53:21] Jackelope: It looks better if you are pretentious, but yes, a 4:3 tv works as well
[1:53:23] Cephyric: Sonatta It's the type of camera that was used to shoot it
[1:53:36] BitTrippn: @Sonatta It's an IMAX ratio, most movies get cropped for regular theaters
[1:53:42] ApathyOwl: @Sonatta was a deliberate decision by snyder aafik, a creative decision
[1:53:48] SpaceDive: just watch the cut parts
[1:53:52] Zrmi: The fights look a lot better too. Like Steppenwolf smashing amazons
[1:53:54] InternetPlumber: thats how all modern movies are shot, they just crop it after
[1:53:55] IronFistOfChina: It's not a movie, but it's good
[1:53:57] WDForty: IMAX isn't 4:3
[1:53:58] Redhulk05: the nest black panther movie will deal with namor and the flooding of wakanda
[1:54:25] BarryCarlyon: bikeWepuns SHOUTINGS
[1:54:31] WDForty: IMAX is more square vs cinema, but it's not 4:3
[1:54:36] LFC_Letters: Hopefully have a MoonKnight trailer too..... please
[1:54:38] Redhulk05: no thanks
[1:54:56] KahunaKona: Hellz yeah Zomboid
[1:55:11] Devlind: imax is 1.43:1 I think
[1:55:24] Heisuisui: LUL
[1:55:25] Devlind: or another weird aspect ratio
[1:55:31] WDForty: IMAX is 1.9:1
[1:55:34] JBfromAccounting: LUL
[1:55:34] Cephyric: It's not imax, they shot the movie with 1.33:1 camera lenses and 4:3 is the closest TV aspect ratio to that

[2:37:47] fells: it'll only ever be your top 10 favorite enjoyed games.

[2:38:07] pc2400: @Tronix_604 sure dude play 2 hours of 100 hour game and say its bad...
[2:38:10] Cephyric: The only way that sort of list can exist on the internet is if every sentence starts with "in my opinion"
[2:38:10] zerohour_88: no reviews can be unbiased
[2:38:11] yrvengalied: true there is no 100% subjective lists
[2:38:12] Deathkanigit101: you say it's impossible but i think it would be great to hear the discussion on dropped frames and the opinions of you cohh, and zeke
[2:38:13] Sathias: Only if you go by sales or something
[2:38:18] thunderhatter: Pong would always have to be number 1 if unbiased
[2:38:19] fells: unless you restrict to top games in a particular genre maybe?
[2:38:21] CadaverLuke: also cant do it cuz no one man has played all the great games out there
[2:38:23] MrGrizzB: you could do it based on score or some other type of stat
[2:38:24] HeyYon: you'd have to have the discussion about if the impact they had should be taken into account (iron man 1 for example)
[2:38:29] Tronix_604: @Stalker2400  i just did..
