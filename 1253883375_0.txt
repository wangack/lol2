[1:14:10] SquamusEpith: so...that means I could potentially play Splinter Cell on gamepass. Okay
[1:14:19] DannyDeVitosHairline: I hope ubisoft+ goes to gamepass but cant see it.
[1:14:21] Ayenea: @pratinha22 ooh now that's a good question
[1:14:22] DannyDeVitosHairline: yes pc gamepass too
[1:14:26] SuddleT: that's good podcast
[1:14:32] pc2400: Ubi+ comes to Xbox and R6extraction is game pass PC and console
[1:14:33] the043: so it's like the EA Play deal for GamePass?
[1:14:33] yrvengalied: just like EA on Sony
[1:14:36] afreak10: why would anyone sub to it
[1:14:47] OptionalSuperboss: access to rainbow 6, watch dogs 1 and 2 and 97 assassin's creed games
[1:15:05] DannyDeVitosHairline: far cry 6 too

[1:15:06] Olegregg88: it's $15/month I think?
[1:15:08] Joebeezer: I hope it's goo
[1:15:10] Asmodeuus: PepeLaugh
[1:15:19] InternetPlumber: hopefully a first step to include it in game pass
[1:15:30] DannyDeVitosHairline: well it dropped in price by 50% since it was announced.
[1:15:31] afreak10: @Stalker2400 not really a ubisoft fan , so not much of a pull :)
[1:15:36] WDForty: extraction has peaked my interest, but no pay full price interest
[1:15:40] DagooX: 3900 Ti POGGERS

[1:16:02] afreak10: Pog
[1:16:29] Arbszy: Sony doing VR right!
[1:16:29] Saryuken: they were pushing a bunch of VR games in PS Plus lately
[1:16:43] Sir_Myrmidon: high res in the middle - lower on outside
[1:16:46] Baske_T: foveated = eye focus tracking rendering
[1:16:52] epicshoo: fabio? ijpSEXY
[1:16:52] ThemDemo: Eye tracking based LOD's
[1:16:53] deexor: KappaPride
[1:16:58] NoorElBahrain: PepoG
[1:17:01] SephonCophen: It's a game-changer when it comes to VR
[1:17:02] Liminaly: less detail where the focus of the eyes are not?
[1:17:10] SZebra: @Liminaly Precisely.
[1:17:11] SephonCophen: If utilized correctly
[1:17:12] SD_PuppetPal_Clem: foviated rendering is a standard approach to like most 3d games lol
[1:17:13] Ekido: foveated rendering is massive boost to VR performance and detail
[1:17:24] InternetPlumber: gpu in the headset for sure
[1:17:27] DannyDeVitosHairline: so i guess sony wants to keep pushing VR
[1:17:32] WDForty: @itmeJP i think that means eye tracking where they make things look better when you're looking directly at it, but downgrade it if your eyes aren't on it
[1:17:34] pc2400: @skittlejunky_001 I have used both for day one releases and its been great instead of paying 60/70 you just pay 15
[1:17:41] SiriusNick: Do they say how it's going to connect to the ps5?
[1:17:49] OranHexthief: thats pretty much the standard for new headsets coming out though
[1:17:49] ChowYun: the specs of this thing feel nuts
[1:18:04] Brogeta92: @SiriusNick single cable connection
[1:18:17] Acheron13: Was there even any gaming for the first generation
[1:18:19] yrvengalied: Hmm
[1:18:22] JonnyFiveO: But can you shop from Walmart from it? ijpHMM
[1:18:26] hawk_moth: Question is how fast people crack the PS VR2 to use it on pc.
[1:18:45] OranHexthief: @Acheron13 RE7 is still locked to PSVR i think
[1:18:46] WDForty: i don't think they ever cracked PS VR1 to work on PC??
[1:18:50] freaker286: Wonder if original PSVR games will work as well
[1:18:54] Spools_: USB-C connection
[1:18:58] strijd__: I’d be happier if Sony would put some of these resources into putting more ps5’s on the shelves so I can actually buy one…. Lol
[1:19:00] deexor: too bad it's for a future console FeelsBadMan
[1:19:01] yrvengalied: time to be like Aloy

[1:22:01] OranHexthief: skull and bones is in hell because the project is in shambles but UBI cant cancel it without getting rocked by the government the studio is based in because of a grant they took @itmeJP
[1:22:03] pc2400: Ghost on PC when modCheck

[1:45:45] ワフルデラ: there's a youtube channel that rigs and they post riggings they do, it's crazy smooth
[1:45:46] HeavHo: The rigging system isn't very easy to make look good. You can find a number of indie vtubers whose riggings look super stiff and honestly would have been better static.

[2:05:15] DoctorJohn: @D3athwatcher hivemind
[2:05:19] SlipCrit: the lip sync was alot better i nthew dlc
[2:05:39] Devlind: Razer launched a new face mask JP, it if possible looks even more crazy and it has a voice amp
[2:05:41] Grond_: all three modern Tomb raider games are free on Epic atm btw if someone is interested
[2:05:44] DoctorJohn: the internet was so upset about Aloy's slightly larger than usual cheeks that they overlooked the atrocious lip sync

[2:06:03] ReginaldXIV: ijpSUS cheeks

[3:10:52] Joebeezer: You had two autos not three
[3:11:07] Lobonidas: probably placebo effect

[3:12:42] DannoTanno: It’s fun as hell, the game, not the players XD
[3:12:45] DawnofFrost_art: for players that don't play him much
[3:12:47] AinzN: ProxyClouds need all those frames for tonguing the enemy!
[3:12:55] titanodin: @itmeJP Good evening hope its going good
[3:13:00] Lobonidas: @FieryOctane when you have a strong laner and want to play aggresive looking for kills
[3:13:02] m3lm4n: gp has one of the lowest win rates in lower ranks, like bottom 5
[3:13:26] prrrah123: @FieryOctane depend on the rule you choose
[3:13:31] DannoTanno: Yea,  it he is busted if you have the skill. His barrels are crazy skill cap ability. In this elo the combo would be luck for them to hit correctly. @itmejp
