[0:22:23] Heretic33: yea, I would agree
[0:22:23] WDForty: personally i'll prob get amd for my next build, but intel is still very good choice, and prob better if you have a use case where you MUST have sability. either way tho, completition is doing really good things right now

[1:22:00] AnorienNightwish: ijpKEK
[1:22:00] DoctorJohn: okay this is just an idea til proven otherwise
[1:22:10] DoctorJohn: this is like when they announced Anthem 4 years before release
[1:22:26] ThaSandus: I feel like it's not worth getting an EV till sometime after 2025 tho, with the upcoming battery technology advancements
[1:22:28] TheAllBodies: Just in time for Tesla to overtake Mercedes and BMW in manufacturing volume
[1:22:31] Galoari: theres no video about this that i know of, but yamaha and kawasaki are developing hydrogen engines now, for multiple uses
[1:22:33] h3ybrian: Just like a video game. Look at it now, shit when it releases
[1:22:46] Shoaron: does EV jsut mean Electric Vehicle?
[1:22:46] Saryuken: Everyone will be EV only by the end of the decade...
[1:22:56] ShrowdArrow: stop taking away my dashboard buttons, please!!!
[1:23:03] lazyxzone: a reasonable body style finally

[1:23:18] woschdvendetta: high
[1:23:20] Lihapiiras: Didn't even know Chrysler even existed anymore. They used to make those god awful 300Cs.
[1:23:22] lazyxzone: 69%
[1:23:23] Freddye: 50%
[1:23:24] Foozzie: high enough
[1:23:24] gorlork: Not very high
[1:23:25] FreshBakedToast: pretty low
[1:23:26] FuzzDBS: very low
[1:23:27] Darnitz: @itmeJP not likely.
[1:23:28] ZcottD: low, and total the car
[1:23:29] BarryCarlyon: Minimal
[1:23:30] RoniBranco: 50%
[1:23:30] woschdvendetta: it will burn down completely
[1:23:30] AngusMacDonald: Depends. And damage is bad.
[1:23:32] SZebra: Unlikely. But if it goes, it goes hard.
[1:23:32] DucksVille: depends
[1:23:33] ThaSandus: the battery? pretty low chance of exploding
[1:23:33] LordArkady5: like a samsung phone?
[1:23:34] DagooX: well if it's a tesla... Kappa
[1:23:35] Omakie: explode low, light on fire maybe
[1:23:36] TheAllBodies: Depends on the chemistry, but very unlikely
[1:23:37] Darnitz: @itmeJP it will burn to the ground
[1:23:37] OuroborosChemist: @Galoari yes while others have given up on those on on heavy duty vehicles due cost and inferiority vs electric cars
[1:23:38] BarryCarlyon: It's also getting better over time
[1:23:39] afreak10: they have to pass checks to release it to public
[1:23:39] JonnyFiveO: Car is dead. Battery burns for several days.
[1:23:39] AngusMacDonald: If you look up Bolt fires, it's bad, it's gone.
[1:23:39] Lutcha81: small chance, but you're fucked if it does
[1:23:40] gorlork: No
[1:23:40] h3ybrian: I don’t trust American ev
[1:23:40] KatjeMauw: it will be on fire

[1:23:42] Darnitz: like most electric fires
[1:23:43] ThaneDarksong: 300%
[1:23:44] SgtStruthers: I would hope not likely
[1:23:44] FreshBakedToast: less likely than a gas car
[1:23:47] Hariga: it'll burn to ther ground
[1:23:48] vashaun: its a lithium battery so its as likely as the ones in your phone
[1:23:48] ThaSandus: It's more like to burn
[1:23:48] Alacod: if gas explodes the car is gone
[1:23:50] k0jak: keep in mind a gas engine is constantly exploding :)
[1:23:50] Pagangods: low but fire is more risk
[1:23:52] BarryCarlyon: If it explodes you've probably been in a REALLY BAD CRASH and have other problems
[1:23:53] br4nd0nh347: For vehicles it's low, every low even with accidents.
[1:23:54] bandyoda: it totals the car...they can't put out a fire with those batteries...they just let it burn down
[1:23:57] InsidiousPlague: i wanna know how they perform at -40
[1:23:57] br4nd0nh347: even
[1:23:59] 1sttimelurker: EV battery plant just had to shut down for that very reason, exploding batteries
[1:23:59] Diaseph: fire is cool
[1:23:59] h3ybrian: The problem about batteries is they are awful for the planet
[1:24:00] Bob__Z: remember those phones exploding, car size
[1:24:02] Miros__: With Richard Hammond's EV car crash, it kept catching fire for a week as the individual cells degraded in a cascade effect @itmeJP
[1:24:03] Mujona: Less damage than your gas tank exploding.
[1:24:03] Liminaly: depends on why it explodes
[1:24:04] Lutcha81: same technology as your phone battery lithium ion
[1:24:07] AngusMacDonald: Chevrolet Bolts have a recall for it.
[1:24:10] Galoari: they dont explode , they burn
[1:24:11] yrvengalied: true
[1:24:11] DangerRangerRex: EVs dont explode the Rapidly Decompose
[1:24:12] ZcottD: teslas have caught on fire already
[1:24:12] Darnitz: @itmeJP if you have ever heard of a transformer blowing it, it sounds like that and it burns down  @itmeJP fyi its happend to them all already
[1:24:12] loki15kun: people will misuse the charges
[1:24:13] Diaseph: EXPLODING CARS
[1:24:13] Averagejoe007: it already happened with Rimmac lol
[1:24:13] SonicTHI: it already did
[1:24:14] the_real_beardcat: its even more secured like a gas tank on a regular car
[1:24:15] Zaalri: it happens to teslas now
[1:24:16] Blaze_Traile: btw gas engine always constantly explode LUL
[1:24:16] ThaSandus: @itmeJP but it has already happened with tesla tho
[1:24:19] the_real_beardcat: so very minimal
[1:24:19] BarryCarlyon: Hammond crashed the prototype racing card BADLY and it didn't pop
[1:24:19] DoctorJohn: weird, right? cause gas cars explode all the time
[1:24:19] bandyoda: it already did
[1:24:19] Foreshen: It has already happened
[1:24:19] Hariga: happens to  tesla once a month
[1:24:20] BirdReligion: I was going to say, i have never heard of one of them blowing
[1:24:21] donnieplayzsum: Google Chevy Bolts
[1:24:22] FuzzDBS: gasoline is explosive though
[1:24:23] Shoaron: I imagine that it's as likely to explode as a combustion car battery?
[1:24:24] Elievex: Random fun trivia, there is a research paper on the effect of big boobs on aerodynamic performance. So maybe on day they will do one for you too PepeLaugh
[1:24:26] GraveSalad: Tesla already had incidents, they still sell fine
[1:24:26] Killercds: Low chance, but if it does crash hard enough to explode, there wasn't a high chance for the car in the first place
[1:24:27] TheAllBodies: @itmeJP you should look up the Chevy bolt, haha
[1:24:28] SgtStruthers: Chat we know how cars work KEKW
[1:24:28] gorlork: It's happened to like all of the brands LUL
[1:24:30] h3ybrian: They just catch fire not really explode
[1:24:31] halfdeadgod: high enough that fire departments in my area told us that weshouldnt charge in the garage cause of the fire risk and that they dont extiguish lithium fires
[1:24:31] PellyPlays: have you seen or heard of the fisker karma spontaneous combustion
[1:24:32] woschdvendetta: in germany the fire department will put burning EV cars in a container filled with water, because it will continually burn days after the fact @itmeJP
[1:24:33] Borhast: https://insideevs.com/news/501729/number-tesla-vehicle-fires-2020/
[1:24:35] Darnitz: @itmeJP issue with LG battery that supplied them to all the ev companies
[1:24:35] PellyPlays: years ago
[1:24:37] Zuleyus: @itmejp, but people didn't stop buying Samsung phones either
[1:24:38] AngusMacDonald: The reason I didn't buy a Chevy when I went to EV
[1:24:39] OuroborosChemist: still EV cars are less likely to burn up than normal petrol cars
[1:24:39] Mujona: Exploding Cars have been a thing since Cars used gas no?
[1:24:40] i_revarm: dude renault are  already known  for  dodgy electronics in their cars, now  imagine how m any  will buy their  EVs LUL
[1:24:40] Liminaly: They put exploding cars in movies all the time tho
[1:24:41] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @itmeJP  your get chimcal burns But the crash will be REALLY REALLY Bad so your like be fatal from the impact
[1:24:43] Jerund: Haven’t there already been Teslas on fire?
[1:24:48] Diaseph: no
[1:24:48] eniGzor: so many Switches Pog
[1:24:51] CastIronJake: @itmeJP & Chat didn't a bunch of Teslas catch on fire from exactly that
[1:24:53] Lihapiiras: Already happened many times. You cannot put out the fire traditioanlly with hosing water.
[1:24:53] SlipCrit: LUL
[1:24:54] Hariga: @woschdvendetta not water..sand

[1:25:03] Shoaron: maybe it has autopilot?
[1:25:03] RandomTangant: Instant vomit for me
[1:25:03] Galoari: @OuroborosChemist ive ridden a few electric "motorcycles" now and they are 100% soulless , so if they manage to due it even if not as efficient ill take it over EV
[1:25:05] dodox25: why peaple cant use there phones?!
[1:25:06] Starlorn: Lithium batteries become unstable if damaged, so I would expect fires and explosions from accidents
[1:25:06] afreak10: and soon to be Ads
[1:25:07] h3ybrian: There’s a reason gm sold hardly any ev last year, bc of the recalls. They lose brand trust
[1:25:10] DagooX: they are developing a new battery that doesn't have the fluid part of the battery
[1:25:10] tkcross21: can shave off a couple 10k by not having passenger screens??
[1:25:11] RandomTangant: Cannot look at anything in cars
[1:25:17] WarBrainZ: The Chevi Bolt was discontinued because of exploding batteries

[1:25:22] zeta0mega: soon car will drive insted of you, so you must be packet with technologies when it happen LUL
[1:25:22] ModMV: @itmeJP SUV Hybrids and EVs are already scary, the batteries are so heavy that their force on impact is much greater
[1:25:23] Diaseph: i want displays outside of the car
[1:25:23] Saryuken: F1 disagrees
[1:25:23] bandyoda: i agree
[1:25:24] mayosilog: Normal Cars explode too, right?
[1:25:26] Shoaron: ijpKEK
[1:25:26] SlipCrit: what if its a yoke?
[1:25:27] coalie: the windshield should just be an LCD showing the selection of drinks at the nearest gas station

[1:25:31] FuzzDBS: easier to drive with leg while eating

[1:25:48] AngusMacDonald: Yokes are a joke, but squared off isn't terrible
[1:25:49] DoctorJohn: just give them a place to mount their own tablets and shit
[1:25:51] JacHighwind: Men In Black also disagrees
[1:25:53] DingoOnMy40: F1 is not circle

[1:25:58] 8mmspikes: Give me a round wheel
[1:25:59] BarryCarlyon: This is probably the worse crash thats gone on file for EV's https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/11/richard-hammond-escaped-crashed-car-seconds-before-being-incinerated but that was a prototype racing car not a consumer grade car
[1:26:00] Thalarg: nice comfy screen to smash into in collision
[1:26:03] BlargMcBlarg: Radical

[1:26:53] Omakie: also the new tesla connects to the starlink network
[1:26:57] Zaalri: built in sim card but uses home wifi for updates
[1:26:58] OuroborosChemist: @Galoari well its more that hydrogen/ bio fuel will always cost 3-5x per mileage vs electricity so applications will be limited to enthusiast and heavy duty solutions that cannot do otherwise
[1:27:00] Omakie: so it can be connected all the time
[1:27:03] Diaseph: STARLINK integration wud be cool
[1:27:05] MaRiNexICEx: thats almost as much as my 350z lol
[1:27:09] Starlorn: I bet the government will have an on/off switch as they have for the mobile network

[1:40:14] AngusMacDonald: I don't think you buy a 150k car w/o being the kind of person who worries about money
[1:40:17] Juksrace: if you do alot of highway travel, the windshield gets messed up fast so you need to replaced
[1:40:17] lazyxzone: 100%
[1:40:19] dasmex: Aesthetics @BillZeBub13

[1:44:20] CtrlAltComplete: @AngusMacDonald oh, i didnt know bezos was in rivian as well. should we expect a model twitch?
[1:44:20] WDForty: i'm ok with touch screen adjustment for the side mirrors and wheel, cause that should be done before you start driving
[1:44:23] RaisinBrvn: now a days though companies want to stick it to the bigger guy. and if the bigger guy wants to buy then they know they have something good. so they hold unless they get their designs or parts bought
[1:44:37] AngusMacDonald: @CtrlAltComplete Yeah, Rivian is making their delivery vans

[1:45:14] oaktree3: why?

[1:45:20] dasmex: why though
[1:45:21] ShrowdArrow: why do I need a mood when driving?
[1:45:23] Liminaly: this feels like early cellphone innovation
[1:45:26] TheAllBodies: @TheAllBodies True, but I don't think they could buy a $100 Billion-ish company. They'd need to wait for their stock to fall, as they run into trouble scaling up
[1:45:28] fdagent: why...
[1:45:28] SZebra: $90bn valuation on $790m revenue. lol.

[1:45:29] oaktree3: car became bedroom XD
[1:45:30] bockbiertje: I wanna have a lapdance when I'm driving this car
[1:45:35] AngusMacDonald: @CtrlAltComplete That's why we bought a Volvo XC40 instead of waiting for the Ioniq 5, soft-touch buttons are gross
[1:45:42] Hidden_Hybrid: i am waiting to see the apple car. not really a fan of apple but i want to see what they are introducing

[1:47:00] dotcombubble: no buttons D:
[1:47:00] Hyluhnduh: y not real time it something seems off with that
[1:47:01] AngusMacDonald: @CtrlAltComplete Solid. Got it for safety. So hyper-aggressive traction control, making it the most boring 400hp haha, but I know my kiddo's gonna be safe AF

[1:48:06] Sakkyoku: If it works and it's cheap and easily fixable it's better than a screen.
[1:48:07] JonnyFiveO: Try using a touch screen in -40C when you want to be wearing gloves.
[1:48:10] Tisces: NODDERS buttons
[1:48:12] CrockettsDota: the physical feedback is just safer for keeping eyes on the road too
[1:48:16] WDForty: BC cops will pull you over for distracted driving for using your touchscreen to adjust car settings

[1:48:29] ThaSandus: not sold on the wheel it looks odd
[1:48:30] GraveSalad: buttons can be learned via muscle memory and done without looking. Screens you always need to verify it changed/is on the screen
[1:48:30] AngusMacDonald: @GameOnPantsOff For real. And the massive ghosting you get on the display when it's that cold.
[1:48:33] Shin_FielDGaR: its a joystick not a wheel
[1:48:35] zeta0mega: touch screen actualy not realy pratical in car. This all will work only with voice assistant

[1:48:56] WDForty: Lucid actually gets and understands UX for drivers!!!!!!!!
[1:48:58] OuroborosChemist: @GameOnPantsOff its never -C inside a electric car during start or you're doing it wrong
[1:48:58] TheAllBodies: those twisty things look kinda cheap

[2:19:51] OuroborosChemist: @OuroborosChemist well true still 5-10 years isnt that long to wait tech to mature is you have less than 10 year old car (very unwise to get one now)
[2:19:52] afreak10: Shako ban that's a weird one
[2:19:53] Altair900: @itmeJP your runes might need changed?

[2:22:53] Harakens: twitch spreading covid with his poison monkaEyes
[2:22:54] Gertew: in the settings i believe
[2:22:56] MADCERBERO: interface
[2:23:01] Bojack_The_Horseman: unleash the kench
[2:23:14] Eplesh: ratio
[2:23:26] HappyMask91: I would love to change the box without changing the text size
[2:23:34] aChillyCube: Think it scales with HUD size
[2:23:48] Spools_: GOTEM
[2:23:58] AinzN: Not even a good Munco skin!
[2:24:22] jmj1987: Dr. Munco
[2:24:28] zivke98: !drops
[2:24:30] zivke98: !drop
[2:24:35] AinzN: Chat who would normally win a Kench v Mundo match up?
[2:24:48] zivke98: they have drop?
[2:24:53] AinzN: No drops here
[2:24:57] MADCERBERO: you need to hold Z key while changing it according to reddit @itmeJP
[2:25:00] sunflower204: something about League+chill music feels very satirical
[2:25:08] jehl3: I would assume Tahm but dunno
[2:25:35] MadHuskies: late game mundo beats every he doesn't die
[2:25:41] MadHuskies: one
[2:25:44] DaChilla74: creep block to strong xD
[2:25:49] BlueSapphyre: @AinzN mundo's passive can counter kench. just got to bait out the passive.
[2:25:58] afreak10: jungle mid gank
[2:26:11] epicshoo: that mundo skin is pretty cool
[2:26:16] AinzN: BlueSapphyre the passive is stops like 1 stun yeah? So that stops Kench's ult?
[2:26:21] Damarus914: Yeah, that CC immunity gonna be a bit of a problem
[2:26:37] BlueSapphyre: @AinzN yeah. the passive sheds kench ult.
[2:26:59] AinzN: So will need to try and procc his ult first then eat him?
[2:27:23] AinzN: Not Ult I mean his passive
[2:27:50] Damarus914: Yeah, pop the passive and not let him pick it up midfight
[2:27:59] ZeroDjinn: looks like you should be doing better than him on CS though with how far back he's been frequently
[2:28:07] HappyMask91: much lower cd
[2:28:08] Baske_T: it reduces the cd for the passicve
[2:28:14] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[2:28:15] BlueSapphyre: lowers the cooldown.
[2:28:37] MADCERBERO: that was such a bad back for mundo
[2:29:59] AinzN: How many Champs are there in League that don't use mana for abilities?
[2:30:26] BlueSapphyre: @AinzN 24/155.
[2:30:35] AinzN: 24? Jeez!
[2:30:36] Baske_T: also might depend if you count 'energy' as mana
[2:30:52] Baske_T: I think some champs have energy which regens faster
[2:31:04] AinzN: What's the difference between energy and mana in this?
[2:31:04] Baske_T: like rogues in wow
[2:31:14] AinzN: Never played WoW
[2:31:26] Baske_T: energy is usually a flat max, like 100
[2:31:28] MADCERBERO: monkaW
[2:31:33] Baske_T: can't increase with items
[2:31:53] Baske_T: but regens more, like 20 a second or something (I'm pulling numbers out of thin air, not sure of the actual values)
[2:31:55] RomanticCreampie: close
[2:32:00] AinzN: Ah ok! Thanks Baske_T ijp7
[2:32:06] Kaleith: at least it gives you a good opportunity to actually back now
[2:32:11] Joebeezer: probably could have waited a little longer to engage maybe
[2:32:11] asymmetrisch: would have been better without the flash
[2:32:16] Kaleith: better than dying to the opponent's gank at some point
[2:32:17] MADCERBERO: was NT
[2:32:19] Damarus914: And there are mechanics to get energy back
[2:32:20] Shoaron: Jammies
[2:32:22] Baske_T: i think kennen is a champ that uses enegy?
[2:32:25] AinzN: Jammies
[2:32:52] Runforyerlives: Kennen and Shen
[2:32:52] BlueSapphyre: @Baske_T yeah. all 4 ninjas and lee sin use energy.
[2:32:58] cardboardbox64: kennen and zed use it along with others i think mostly assassins use energy
[2:32:58] asymmetrisch: they are pinging top tower
[2:33:11] MADCERBERO: its ok that mundo will be behind for a bit
[2:33:23] Swiftfool: I hate twitch players with a passion
[2:33:43] Baske_T: there's also champs that gain a resource when they do things that give them bonuses, like tryndamere's rage bar
[2:34:41] afreak10: good save

[2:38:14] LokiCanadian: Grevious wounds and % health dmg champs or items
[2:38:17] rwings8: ignite or grievous wounds really only way to gank him

[2:54:44] superpinch: xerath?
[2:54:47] konvay: Xerath hypeE
[2:54:51] Ceadeuss: xrand
[2:54:55] ZeroDjinn: Nah, you jump on Xerath and he's dead
[2:54:58] Mujona: Xerath is strong, but his damage is all skill shots.
[2:54:59] KonikMiejski: if you hit KEKW
[2:55:01] Barba06: every one of his abilities is a skillshot
[2:55:01] Razielvj: nah, he has no mobility
[2:55:03] Cronopolis: Akshan is currently bugged and much weaker unless there was a hotfix
[2:55:03] Baske_T: he's super glass cannon
[2:55:05] Inmortalis: not broken, its very immoble
[2:55:05] Omakie: just dont let him keep you at range
[2:55:06] mbryer07: xerath is very difficult
[2:55:06] Jukettaja: I've never struggled against Xerath
[2:55:06] StarPogPlatinum: It's all skill shots though
[2:55:07] Tronix_604: xerath and swain are S tier low elo supports
[2:55:13] DaChilla74: he is not very mobile ^^
[2:55:18] PrvtTweeks: I think Vel'koz is more annoying than Xerath rn
[2:55:19] m3rcer: xerath has no escape and its all skillshot iirc
[2:55:27] ZeroDjinn: I love me some artillery mages and Xerath just poops himself if someone looks at him from half screen
[2:55:29] Jukettaja: But you can just ult Soraka
[2:55:29] Bojack_The_Horseman: am i seeing soraka top

[2:55:44] ZeroDjinn: Soraka top
[2:55:46] Mujona: They have no front line though, seems like an easy win mid-late
[2:55:49] Omakie: soraka top should be easy though
[2:55:56] lStarkx: yup
[2:55:57] Omakie: bully her hard
[2:55:58] Jukettaja: It was once

[2:56:10] Jukettaja: Soraka spams Q a lot
[2:56:11] MostlyHype: just a lot of poke
[2:56:13] Mujona: She just spams Q and heals through lane until 6
[2:56:24] Jukettaja: It's not so bad for Garen who can passively heal
[2:56:31] mbryer07: gonna be honest expected ekko jungle not zed
[2:56:32] cardboardbox64: back in the day she was used in all lanes cause she was so broken
[2:56:34] Omakie: gamba

[2:57:21] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: we belieb rooBobble
[2:57:36] thrillhouse451: JP is barefoot!

[2:59:24] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:59:34] Miros__: @Swiftfool because Silver 4
[2:59:41] lStarkx: bot gap
[2:59:58] ZeroDjinn: I think as long as you get on her she's dead.
[3:00:04] ZeroDjinn: jsut cant let free poke
[3:00:38] mokey95: wow soraka top.. I've been out of the game a looong time
[3:00:53] ZeroDjinn: it's not common mokey95

[3:02:10] PrvtTweeks: Bully her out
[3:02:15] ZeroDjinn: it's pushing to you now
[3:02:17] PrvtTweeks: She can't take Garen in a straight up fight
[3:02:19] lStarkx: e the way on lvl 5
[3:02:24] PrvtTweeks: if she tries freezing the lane, jump her face
[3:02:37] freka_man: stay behind wave get her to auto atack u
[3:03:03] AKraftyBasterd: bronzeGASM
[3:03:50] lStarkx: push push and reset
[3:04:08] kooshy_j: LUL
[3:04:12] m3rcer: yes he was
[3:04:14] Dredstryde: Yeah he threw shadow over the wall
[3:04:15] PrvtTweeks: That was Zed in the tribrush yeah
[3:04:21] m3rcer: shadow clone
[3:04:29] AlteredMP: yea that was Zeds W
[3:04:31] Samstein: he probably fucked up somehow
[3:04:32] PrvtTweeks: He'll throw his shadow out and he can throw skillshots from it
[3:04:37] birkhoms: yup, zed came to gank and they messed it up
[3:04:44] Destroy541: are we losing lane to soraka?
[3:04:46] Farnzy11: naruto in the jungle ijpONO
[3:04:57] PrvtTweeks: tbh Zed didn't have that gank anyway, not on a level 7 garen
[3:05:00] rwings8: Zed can cast a shadow the shadow copies his abilities and he can switch and move to the shadow if he wants
[3:05:55] Ruffion: Win?
[3:06:25] Inmortalis: reset
[3:06:35] ZeroDjinn: good time to base
[3:06:39] StarPogPlatinum: back ?
[3:06:43] PrvtTweeks: Yeah I'd go buy, 2k gold in the bank
[3:06:51] kooshy_j: I mean she has 0 kill pressure anyways
[3:06:51] PrvtTweeks: good time for some goodies to bully Raka with
[3:06:52] br4nd0nh347: fortunately you have a champ that can heal the poke
[3:06:56] lStarkx: its gonna push to u ur good
[3:07:14] ZeroDjinn: should be able to hard push her over and over with boots I'd think
[3:07:33] ZeroDjinn: oh she has no boots as well so good kill pressure now
[3:08:05] br4nd0nh347: that's normal for league always the cannon  LUL
[3:08:07] Barba06: missing canons any% speedrun NODDERS
[3:08:20] PrvtTweeks: F for cannon minions
[3:08:53] Joebeezer: that silence is a long cooldown
[3:08:59] tjaronee: thats a cent in the pot
[3:09:17] br4nd0nh347: what is this raka doing?
[3:09:20] PrvtTweeks: Soraka benefits most from a passive lane opponent.
[3:09:20] afreak10: nice
[3:09:22] Dbrn47: modzPOG
[3:09:24] jollydadbod: Good shit
[3:09:27] MultipleOfZero: get rekt
[3:09:35] Reijm11: gotem
[3:09:38] PrvtTweeks: If you're aggro and know to just engage she'll have kind of a rough time
[3:09:44] lStarkx: Ur item active gives extra burst
[3:09:47] afreak10: Garen such a good lane pusher
[3:09:53] Dbrn47: nah man, that was a good play
[3:09:54] Swiftfool: you can auto q the tower
[3:09:58] Barba06: Garen is simple but enjoyable
[3:10:10] afreak10: gj
[3:10:10] vashaun: is being kind a thing in LoL?
[3:10:12] lormike: LUL Rekt
[3:10:16] asymmetrisch: Clap
[3:10:19] Dredstryde: ez second tower
[3:10:19] PrvtTweeks: Exactly like that though. GJ
[3:10:19] afreak10: and just after teleport
[3:10:23] lStarkx: u can use the item while spinning doble spin
[3:10:28] xDreadnord: going well
[3:10:32] titanodin: @itmeJP Good evening sir
[3:10:35] Barba06: that zed is so low level
[3:10:37] Dragnoff: one trick with him is if you quickly QE the Q will still go off after the spin
[3:10:37] Barba06: you could kill him
[3:10:43] Farnzy11: That seemed like a very smart Shaco play? Lol. I don't know anything but it seemed good
[3:10:43] DobbsjustDobbs: What the hell is that giant bug that deletes turrets?
[3:10:50] PrvtTweeks: Rift herald
[3:10:59] Dredstryde: She is named Shelly
[3:11:01] PrvtTweeks: Takes the place of Baron for the early game
[3:11:03] Dredstryde: She is awesome and dances really well
[3:11:15] JuIgDeMaUr: If I remember right, Q resets auto attack so you can take advantage of that when hitting the towers. At least that was the case 5 or 6 years ago Kappa
[3:11:23] Joebeezer: if raka cat
[3:11:26] Dbrn47: nice
[3:11:26] afreak10: LUL
[3:11:29] the_ch0: Clap
[3:11:29] ChowYun: Lmao
[3:11:31] Barba06: why didn't she hit the plant xD
[3:11:32] Qutini: A jungle monster that your team can kill to push towers
[3:11:34] afreak10: Clap
[3:11:36] Omakie: you coulda killed both of those 2 aswell lol
[3:11:38] debajr: holy shit that was a lot of dmg
[3:11:42] PrvtTweeks: That's why I don't really know why people are afraid of Soraka in lane. Lol
[3:12:09] PrvtTweeks: If you're just aggro she kinda gets dunked on
[3:12:11] xDreadnord: wow
[3:12:16] Ruffion: I’m glad your playing garen, I need pointers.
[3:12:16] WeeMr_Goodcat: man i dont know the next thing about LoL but JP is doing the stuff, and i like it.
[3:12:53] Cronopolis: Garen is simple man. He spin. He win.
[3:13:00] JuIgDeMaUr: Da hell is that invi shit? Is that a new thing?
[3:13:13] PrvtTweeks: Chemdrake
[3:13:21] Qutini: ye thats new

[3:13:38] Omakie: anything is possible
[3:13:39] Barba06: enemy team's already flaming each other
[3:13:41] Dbrn47: have to start throwing
[3:13:48] ReMaestro: I've seen people lose 19-2 in silver LUL
[3:13:48] mokey95: you only need 1  throw though
[3:14:06] PrvtTweeks: With how fed MOST people are I think that'd have to be one hell of a throw
[3:14:14] ChowYun: Lv 9 zed lmao
[3:14:21] kooshy_j: they have zero peel for twitch so it's just over lol
[3:14:27] tjaronee: feelings are silly
[3:14:28] PrvtTweeks: Kai'sa is looking like she can just 1v5 rn
[3:14:32] Dredstryde: Was a jungle zed - that team did some weird stuff
[3:14:52] Farnzy11: Unless they have the ultimate hopium team this should be over in 3 mins lol
[3:14:53] Barba06: oh look that zed almost damaged you
[3:15:00] AinzN: Clap
