[0:34:42] Dolenz: Days Gone was very good but the start of the game is pretty boring and disappointing, which is a very bad mistake to make
[0:34:48] DyingEros: I didn't finish it til the first DLC
[0:34:51] thanh_n2004: i do remember you comparing exploration between botw and horizon itmeJP
[0:34:53] Viriskali15: I'm so excited for botw2
[0:34:55] Tobin: you planning on plat the PC release of GoW JP?
[0:35:01] Crimson9660: Horizon was overshadowed by botw
[0:35:04] Tobin: *playing
[0:35:06] GomJabbar9: Why bonjour there!
[0:35:06] UnctiousSC: breath of the wild for me was just like that, 8 hour work day, come home, play botw til bed, rinse repeat

[0:35:17] zymioi: breath of the wild

[0:35:20] Dbrn47: Boy
[0:35:29] 14neo: @DejaDrew it can be said to be good, just not 'holy hell it was incredible' as some people stipulate, i reckon is the discussion

[0:35:35] BlazeRom: oh yes\
[0:35:36] TheChristopherG: Pokemon Arceus also at the end of January

[0:36:08] DyingEros: That'll be the first mod LUL
[0:36:09] BoltActionPotato: Horizon was great but I don't think feel like it needed sequel, they could've moved on to different ip imo.
[0:36:10] ghost_sprite: COCKA
[0:36:12] ash_licker: but imagine the double Ds on kratos, can't wait!
[0:36:13] UrsusLvovich: can't wait
[0:36:17] Altair900: Underwear Kratos, cant wait
[0:36:18] Breezaholic: Kratos Thong loin cloth would be fucking hot.
[0:36:19] Qritical: Kratos probably does have a fucking hog on him
[0:36:20] DejaDrew: @Crimson9660 I wouldn't say that.  I liked it better than BOTW
[0:36:23] SZebra: GoW:R
[0:36:26] Ahmad_kb: GOW

[0:36:33] DyingEros: GoW
[0:36:34] Monchenjiners23: GoW
[0:36:35] bakavic: we know nothing of the new GOW yet
[0:36:35] HermitPeanut79: @BoltActionPotato same,,,the story kinda ended
[0:36:37] ReginaldXIV: I think open world games can be categorized as pre-BOTW and post-BOTW now
[0:36:37] Brogeta92: GoW is more mainstream
[0:36:40] ThemDemo: Keeping in mind that critic expectations are so high for GOW
[0:36:53] gigamesh00: "i hate how thor looks"
[0:36:55] Yorkshir666: gow by a mile
[0:36:59] Akizea: @ReginaldXIV ABSOLUTELY THIS
[0:37:11] Truder2k: I would actually like a spin-off of Horizon from the Enduring Victory days of the lore... could even be a shooter
[0:37:18] Zaalri: horizion is easier to score because it will look amazing within the first 30mins when the critics will actually play
[0:37:23] Crimson9660: @dejadrew at the time when they both released all the talk was about botw no one was really talking about horizon
[0:37:26] the_undying1: Elden Ring > God of war Ragnarok > Horizon
[0:37:27] ritchie313: LUL
[0:37:31] Breezaholic: LUL someone clip this, we need to reflect on how accurate this take is in 3 months.
[0:37:32] Ippsi: GoW might be controversial since they might kill of Kratos
[0:37:35] ThemDemo: Same thoughts here
[0:37:37] Hyluhnduh: D:
[0:37:41] MysticDryad: i hate how much that sounds believable
[0:37:44] DejaDrew: @Crimson9660 It sold 8 million copies first year, and now far more.
[0:37:44] RlDennis: @ReginaldXIV It's kinda weird that no open world games have clicked with me since botw other than Ghost of Tsushima
[0:37:48] yellgler: GoW needs to have another ridiculously good story in order to not have reviewers say it's just an inferior sequel
[0:37:49] leovic1: Hmm
[0:37:50] ThemDemo: Agreed
[0:37:52] SZebra: Oh, definitely.
[0:37:57] Omid18: we should do a bet for this LUL

[0:38:06] Dbrn47: i don't own a playstation so that narrows it down for me.  Elden Ring.
[0:38:08] Zaalri: souls always have middling reviews
[0:38:09] Cezz: Question, Has JP already watched LoL 2022 cinematic?
[0:38:11] zymioi: it all depends on what the kinda of funny crew like people say

[1:00:29] zeta0mega: you cant buys GPU in 2022 so enjoy graphics that can be handles by anything ijpCLAP
[1:00:30] WestElmCaleb: Wait so it simultaneously has BotW non-turn based combat and also turned based JRPG combat?
[1:00:35] epicshoo: can we eat pokemon now? monkaS
[1:00:37] HeavHo: Pokemon has never been about graphics, so I don't care. But it also just seems barren, which is bad.

[2:43:00] DrYaguar: they do, the mobile version is not an 12 years old game
[2:43:01] konvay: They couldn't have waited 1-2 months for these? lol
[2:43:01] loki15kun: they did have time for a better engine at least by the lloks
[2:43:04] Kaleith: catJAM

[2:43:08] Boshean: they smoothed out brand in the mobile version
[2:43:18] KB__1: i thought wild rift was mobile and console
[2:43:21] Keyah: Proof that Riot don't care about LoL - It's just a sustained money thing. They balance and build for everything but LoL these days.
[2:43:32] Z3r0Fear: Sett passing out lol
[2:43:33] zymioi: @Skyform and u are not in game for 80 min getting toxic  at

[2:44:44] Ermaluck: Ha maybe
[2:44:44] Baske_T: @Keyah LoL (the PC game) has probably hit near saturation in their minds, so expanding to other games/devices is their plan most likely
[2:44:47] m3rcer: definitely
[2:44:47] SuperMrBC: probably
[2:44:54] Blexun: do they bring their own phones
[2:44:55] TPLivewire: Can you play on Ipad?

[2:45:53] Delkata: come to Brazil
[2:45:55] 1TrueTyrant: Man that voice takes me back to season 2 days
[2:46:04] PrimogenitureJ: Some have regional names and then some are just "sea" LUL
[2:46:26] Baske_T: PC league esports is probably advertising/marketing budget

[2:47:59] Keyah: @Wildskunk inochiLUL
[2:48:01] HeavHo: @PrimogenitureJ It's okay, most people seem to just not know SEA exists. I live in Singapore, and somehow people keep saying Singapore is in East Asia next to China. We're in SEA.

[3:27:02] 14neo: yeah i think this is the whole 'don't play ARAM' thing the tips were talking about that resulted in CS deficit
[3:27:07] Filou_icu: remember the 10 tips of toplane
[3:27:10] Pingues: you need to distract the casters for yi

[3:35:54] Laurix246: Oh no
[3:35:55] ZacharyAaron: that's also why league is so toxic btw. It engenders hate because you can get dragged down by teammates
[3:35:56] Miros__: uh
[3:35:56] CorduroyCashley: cohhGV
[3:35:58] loki15kun: rank reset, right
[3:35:58] Bebop400: you will go up fast
[3:36:00] GGam3r: up only bois
[3:36:00] AlterAngelus: it said provisional rank
[3:36:01] 1TrueTyrant: No, thats just where you start
[3:36:01] eLMaQ: yea, hard reset
[3:36:05] rubxcubedude: reset beginning of season
[3:36:11] SlCKNESS: it immediately puts you into a rank now, yeah
[3:36:14] Tyler_Ty: Hi JP, keep up the grind!
[3:36:15] Opoppopro: you gain like 60 lp per win tho
[3:36:17] Galoari: and if u lose 10 games, do u stay there?
[3:36:18] afreak10: go Garen :)
[3:36:19] WaxCourant: There was a 5 tier demotion to start the season.
[3:36:20] slycefyre: @thunderhatter yi fell apart toward the end, he kept trying to 1v9 and just trickled into teamfights if he was in them at all
[3:36:21] TK_the_Pirate: bold of you to assume its only up from there ;)
[3:36:22] fdagent: loosing is just a step to victory
[3:36:22] schwed15: still 9 more placements
[3:36:22] Faintlich: I think its just a visual thing until placements are done, it does that in TFT too
[3:36:22] rHakkar: Hey @itmeJP is it not better to play an assassin top, cuse them late game you might 1v9?
[3:36:22] Saryuken: You start iron and move up. 10 games no minus on loss
[3:36:24] eLMaQ: challegnger start in plat or gold i think
[3:36:30] mbryer07: the more wins you get in promos the closer to the rank you previously had you get
[3:36:31] thunderhatter: need like a jax or garen to carry
[3:36:41] AlterAngelus: Tahm is not so much a hard carry like a fiora or riven
[3:36:43] WaxCourant: Yeah, when you win you'll get like 50lp.
[3:36:44] yanzz_: play juggernauts top to carry in lower elo
[3:36:45] Tronix_604: split push urgot top next 9 games straight!
[3:36:51] WaxCourant: Since your MMR is Silver.
[3:36:51] Darkaros: rHakkar he's played enough Kayle to get tired of the 50/50 "i either 1 v 9 or the team collapses in mid game"
[3:36:55] freaker286: Only mistake that game I think was not giving yi the kills when he came to your lane. Could have accelerated him to be stronger earlier
[3:36:57] Samstein: Garen could probably carry if he get fed
[3:36:58] RoniBranco: Thats the problem with TK, he cant carry
[3:36:59] Kymix: nah
[3:37:02] 1TrueTyrant: Prolly silver
[3:37:03] freaker286: and ya, start low and then you go higher quickly
[3:37:06] Saryuken: or sivler if you are lucky
[3:37:06] SquiZNovus: Every1 will place lower mostly than what they were
[3:37:07] Omakie: bronze about 75% chance
[3:37:10] Twizzlar: maybe, most people start lower division
[3:37:15] Keyah: If you were silver before, you'd need to lose like 7 to place bronze
[3:37:18] Tyler_Ty: Most likely bronze yeah
[3:37:27] Kymix: the ranking system and mmr are different things, you always have to build up your rank again. all the while your mmr will most likely stay in silver
[3:37:30] ninja2601: yep
[3:37:32] afreak10: double yone
[3:37:36] ThatManRan: i was gold now bronze 2
[3:37:39] Z3r0Fear: Bronze and Iron league are hell incarnate
[3:37:43] WaxCourant: So your rank gets demoted 5 tiers, but your MMR is still the same. So you aren't playing against iron players.
[3:37:44] SquiZNovus: If you were S1 than maybe S3/4 is doable if you win enough
[3:37:47] bulletsponge55: I don't think you'll be bronze, you'll probably still end up in silver
[3:37:50] EvoCaliber: ouch
[3:37:52] Joulupukin: @itmeJP as long as your win-loss is positive I think you get boosted lp gains from wins after placements.
[3:37:58] ZacharyAaron: it's a very quick rank up relatively though
[3:38:04] Orangemorph: You get like 60-70 lp per win though
[3:38:05] eLMaQ: its grind man :)
[3:38:05] Faintlich: I was bout to ask LOL
[3:38:08] Gat0rCh0mp: Thats where they took your max rank for the year, so thats where they think youll get back to, not start
[3:38:10] ReMaestro: climbing out of bronze will be hell Sadge
[3:38:10] jeffhunter12: sounds like a record that broke
[3:38:11] s_k_o_m: ye it sounds as if i would have to pause/unpause :D
[3:38:14] Kymix: it sounded slightly off key
[3:38:15] Faintlich: thought it was the twitch bug but the song is just broken
[3:38:18] WaxCourant: Even if you go like 6 and 4 you'll probably end up like bronze 1/silver4.
[3:38:20] ElSpartin: I think it was a lofi of a lofi since it was the radio version
[3:38:26] ZacharyAaron: that's just lofi style
[3:38:26] Elyoslayer: I was D2 before they added the Grandmaster rank and I just ragequit the game, no regrets, actully my life became better by leaps
[3:38:27] thunderhatter: vayne top also worked for me
[3:38:28] Notenoughcoffee: teemo :)
[3:38:28] Darkaros: New prediction just dropped OOOO

[3:38:49] Kymix: monkaHmm
[3:38:56] Kymix: Who to pick monkaHmm
[3:38:57] verentnarv: @itmejp should probably have one champ for when your team is squishy and one when your team is too tanky, last game TK was a good choice, but the team just feel apart

[3:43:03] Darkaros: !makecommand app JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[3:43:03] itmeBOT: !app ADDED

[3:44:38] DCHenkels: Lux, Buddy, don't play ranked if you are clocked int at work that requires you to take calls

[3:50:41] thunderhatter: when with him wasting the q you can dominate him
[3:50:55] teeders: generally speaking you dont want to leave you wave like you just did
[3:51:03] jingosaurus: might want to think about pink wards for Evelynn
[3:51:06] Haeher: JP having a good time top rooComfy
[3:51:18] ZacharyAaron: can only do what you can do
[3:51:24] StarPogPlatinum: Yeah he's just gonna put mini nuke everywhere and be useful
[3:51:33] RomanticCreampie: !backseat
[3:51:33] itmeBOT: JP might not read or respond to everything, but he is happy to get non-spoilery, respectful advice on games. Keep in mind, any backseating that is linked to the story of the game ( do X to get Y outcome) is prohibited. ijpLOVE
[3:51:34] NotMyPersona: The woes of top lane NotLikeThis
[3:51:58] RacingQueen: nature's force counter teemo r?
[3:52:15] mbryer07: I think once you can tank for in team fights itll help them alot
[3:52:37] Nickonil: waffleThink i guess jp just has to farm teemo so bad, that he is unkillable, and split push
[3:52:48] Haeher: HYPERCLAP
[3:52:52] AlterAngelus: push wave
[3:52:52] ElSpartin: safer certainly
[3:52:57] Samstein: a kill is a kill
[3:53:06] teeders: merc treads probably good idea for evelyn charm
[3:53:12] SquiZNovus: Its ok, free merc treads
[3:53:26] Bebop400: you could go for a tp bot play when you have a chance
[3:53:30] ElSpartin: oh god, lux is 6?
[3:53:36] SquiZNovus: Their team is so overloaded on AP
[3:53:43] DrYaguar: MF is going mid
[3:53:45] StarPogPlatinum: mf not here
[3:54:02] Haeher: if bot cant win on its own just gotta do it yourself NODDERS
[3:54:17] 14neo: unlucky tongues - also a fed lane it seems
[3:54:18] HumanAres: kraken hurts
[3:54:19] ritchie313: D:
[3:54:19] mbryer07: the ashe has been getting fed
[3:54:32] eLMaQ: ashe + aggro from minons
[3:54:33] afreak10: Garen
[3:54:37] teeders: you need b and tp top he can solo
[3:54:37] ElSpartin: Garen?
[3:54:38] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[3:54:39] Saryuken: Irelia
[3:54:40] Z3r0Fear: Malphite is pretty good
[3:54:40] GGam3r: teemo
[3:54:40] teeders: his ping was a bait
[3:54:41] jingosaurus: you need a hard carry
[3:54:42] AlterAngelus: Garen would be good
[3:54:44] s_k_o_m: build more bruise-y with grieves - or Shen
[3:54:46] AlterAngelus: or fiora
[3:54:47] SquiZNovus: Wait what... Tahm is so broken. It will
[3:54:48] xxunklekarlxx: mondo
[3:54:48] jingosaurus: id tp top
[3:54:49] KarmaTheQueen: Sett?
[3:54:55] DrYaguar: Camille
[3:55:00] Gank4CE1: Mord Sett Aatrox NODDERS
[3:55:01] SuicidalFloopy: darius\jax?
[3:55:02] DigitalShiver: darius or sett
[3:55:05] SquiZNovus: But you need your team with you, you cant solo
[3:55:07] Sha1yen: @itmeJP if you wanna climb out of toplane, I'd suggest stuff like Darius or Renekton
[3:55:09] Harakens: Mordekaiser might be a good pick
[3:55:11] TheZander: Renekton, Fiora, Camille, Riven, something like that?
[3:55:17] Punketsu: Darius is a damn good one
[3:55:19] jingosaurus: should have killed ashe, drag, then just tp right away
[3:55:21] mr_moustachi: tanks are great but you need damage
[3:55:25] 14neo: welp, red team wins prediction i reckon
[3:55:27] Neragsito: pay up mods
[3:55:29] teeders: prio tp back top sooner. The jg bait you
[3:55:31] schwed15: doubters win
[3:55:37] SquiZNovus: You did have TP tho, so could back and TP top instead of mid
[3:55:38] Haeher: Sadge temoo coming back
[3:55:48] ProxyClouds: Tham not good at split pushing?
[3:55:52] ZacharyAaron: that is the league experience
[3:55:53] GGam3r: this is the league experience lol
[3:55:58] Duo245: Every time
[3:56:01] Darkdevilly: when you killed ashe just back and tp top
[3:56:03] Saryuken: the feeling when your team is 2 kills behind and you are 5/0
[3:56:04] jeffhunter12: your gonna need a hard carry then
[3:56:07] allscorpion: tanks rely on the team too much
[3:56:07] TheZander: Sounds more and more like you need to get on the bruiser train
[3:56:11] Xeby17: Maybe a carry champion is a better pick since your early game is so good?
[3:56:13] Sha1yen: I mean, day 1 is always bad. Because lots of elos get mashed together
[3:56:14] afreak10: Bot going crazy
[3:56:17] DyingEros: I'm legit getting osmosis salt from  these last two games. I don't k now how you do it
[3:56:23] Gank4CE1: top only good if you blrainlessly push it seems
[3:56:24] Haeher: bot getting fucked rooSlain
[3:56:26] Crazy_Miner51: Also, you dont really need armor this game. They have 3 magic damage dealers so mr is much more usefuil
[3:56:33] ChowYun: U may wanna try spitpushers then
[3:56:49] RyuSensei: OOOO
[3:56:50] AlterAngelus: LuL
[3:56:52] SquiZNovus: that Teemo is so bad lol

[3:56:53] Proph89: Viebro
[3:56:53] Punketsu: lmfao
[3:57:03] Opoppopro: he didn't want assist i guess
[3:57:03] SquiZNovus: why is he even there
[3:57:06] leer_solarbeam: moon2JAM
[3:57:12] Punketsu: watching Teemo die is therapy for the soul
[3:57:13] johnfive21: Is someone like Shen viable this meta?
[3:57:14] StarPogPlatinum: why not try a splitpusher ? You go for objectives, might win you the game
[3:57:17] s_k_o_m: push the lane out
[3:57:24] harnessed: you can just push top full time until you have a tp spot
[3:57:26] afreak10: should get the tower
[3:57:26] s_k_o_m: is what i woul do at least
[3:57:27] evilzookeeper: no one is coming top though so capitalise on it
[3:57:31] Twizzlar: i mean teemo doing same thing as urgot, they are worth nothing so just shoving and getting xp & farm
[3:57:31] Xeby17: Tahm seems only good if your team is good, can't solo carry easily
[3:57:39] TDotTerror: That chat...it's like crabs fighting to get outta the bucket.
[3:57:41] freaker286: I could see you loving a darius
[3:57:51] Sha1yen: wtf was that Lux ult?!
[3:57:54] Ewlu: tom just cant win you games like these, he is great when you have a realiable team but when you have well this he is stuck
[3:57:54] StarPogPlatinum: lmao
[3:57:55] jingosaurus: darius 100%
[3:57:56] Chopstix2005: that MF does zero dmg
[3:58:00] DrYaguar: KEKW your team
[3:58:00] Samstein: oh yeah darius is awesome
[3:58:07] teeders: Lux R hit mars
[3:58:14] SquiZNovus: If you really want to carry you should play something like Darius or Camille. Harder than Kench but can solo carry until mid game and even after that
[3:58:22] mbryer07: well its aram time
[3:58:28] WantedOne: u.gg is rating yone real low for top and mid this patch(was an s, showing as d) did he get nerfed or other chars just got that much better 0_0
[3:58:30] ChowYun: Dont think thornmail is needed here.
[3:58:49] Punketsu: MF is griefing tbh
[3:58:53] galdamesh: @WantedOne immortal shield bow got nerfed
[3:58:53] Punketsu: she does zero dmg
[3:58:58] omgitsjason: maybe just split push at this point, try to get something done elsewhere
[3:59:07] ritchie313: sett and darius are good solo carry type top laners that are also tanky
[3:59:08] SquiZNovus: Fastest way to get more power out of the champions is itemizing against enemy instead of standard U.GG items
[3:59:14] Samstein: yeah MF got tilted the moment Lux was afk for a few seconds
[3:59:15] mbryer07: go get levels
[3:59:22] Fiendmaw: I heard the new season released,are there major balance shakeups?
[3:59:26] Harakens: JP's experience rn is exactly what i'm having with the new season LUL
[3:59:27] SuicidalFloopy: Not watching lots of JP, may I ask what's his history with league of legends?
[3:59:33] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[3:59:42] SquiZNovus: The Thornmail is useless this game. Should have gone Spirit Visage or somethjing vs 4 AP champs
[3:59:46] Darkaros: !whylol
[3:59:47] RyuSensei: team is asleep lmao
[3:59:48] itmeBOT: Did you know that JP's beloved, Aureylian, is Riot Games' Global Head of Player Community? JP now wants to learn League of Legends to connect with her and her co-workers ijpLOVE https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1444862232140070912

[4:00:52] freaker286: LUL that lux is so bad
[4:00:53] s_k_o_m: your lane is bleeding money and xp
[4:01:00] Orangemorph: You could of blocked it for her
[4:01:03] Fiendmaw: Zoe 60% off screen,the classic
[4:01:04] titanodin: oh its the paddle star champ, she is OP
[4:01:04] zymioi: @SuicidalFloopy all so his wife works for the company so we are supporting her :)
[4:01:05] MammothEU: A fellow Mammoth in the game cohhPog
[4:01:19] Harakens: a Zoe that knows how to play is legit the most annoying shit to play against
[4:01:22] s_k_o_m: i know - i just point out what i see, small things - not your fault
[4:01:24] sunflower204: top usually don't carry
[4:01:24] allscorpion: @Sha1yen silver linings, nice
[4:01:34] SuicidalFloopy: @zymioi yeah saw the command, thanks!
[4:01:36] CDubTheRIPper: Pog
[4:01:37] titanodin: end the game top
[4:01:43] SquiZNovus: Well yes....you are cuz they will have to answer giving room to your team
[4:01:48] harnessed: force them to come to you when you have tp up probably
[4:01:52] jingosaurus: yeah if they want to aram, try and get something somewhere else
[4:01:54] Tronix_604: applying pressure to a diff lane is never bad
[4:01:55] Ermaluck: they coming for you
[4:01:55] SquiZNovus: Not if Zoe gets force fed, but normally yea
[4:01:55] DagooX: godlike monkaS
[4:02:01] Ewlu: @sunflower204 not true, if you play something like irellia you can carry
[4:02:06] StarPogPlatinum: They're just mid waiting to get poke to death at this point
[4:02:07] CDubTheRIPper: monkaS
[4:02:07] Darkdevilly: next time when you winning lane,if bot/mid losing, spamm ping for jung to shadow you and take objectives probs
[4:02:16] Twizzlar: feel like mid & jung can have most impact on the game
[4:02:26] Darkaros: do towers give teamwide gold in LoL? if so that's always nice to stem the bleeding of a team
[4:02:28] afreak10: EZ
[4:02:28] CDubTheRIPper: EZ
[4:02:32] appaomega: Nice
[4:02:33] Bebop400: nice

[4:02:45] Baske_T: @Darkaros yes I believe so, even more if they are objectives bounties
[4:02:46] afreak10: keep pushing
[4:02:47] Barba06: For every kill JP gets, 2 people die on his team LUL
[4:02:48] Haeher: that temoo is just getting murdered KEKW
[4:02:49] StarPogPlatinum: maybe tower
[4:02:49] zenoots: lol i hate tahm kench so much
[4:02:50] s_k_o_m: it lets you push, forces them over
[4:02:52] Bebop400: p
[4:02:55] appaomega: dive that push!
[4:02:55] evilzookeeper: your mid tower is still up despite aram
[4:02:56] Bebop400: push
[4:02:57] Fiendmaw: Towers are more valuable now I think
[4:02:58] Punketsu: that Zoe holy shit
[4:02:59] RomanticCreampie: hard to carry from top unless u play a splitpusher
[4:03:01] Opoppopro: push until they come to you, at least your team won't die i guess?
[4:03:05] eLMaQ: need some item to help you push faster
[4:03:08] zymioi: no jungle no supports = bad times
[4:03:21] Sogrom: get a sweeper and clear out his bombs then push ?
[4:03:23] Punketsu: I don't think I've ever seen a good Zoe, that's terrifying
[4:03:26] evilzookeeper: yeah tough game when mid/bot is afk
[4:03:41] Bebop400: wow
[4:03:43] afreak10: F
[4:03:43] jingosaurus: thats kind of the goal so that your team can get something somewhere else
[4:03:47] jingosaurus: but its silver so /shrug
[4:03:49] Fiendmaw: Zoe too busy farming mid
[4:03:54] its__fil: Sadge

[4:03:57] ErikThe_Viking: Rip 150k points
[4:03:59] vpopeprohladno: Sadge
[4:03:59] Jormunduur: @itmeJP if you switch from Tahm Kench, who are you thinkg about playing
[4:04:02] StarPogPlatinum: that was a sad game Sadge
[4:04:10] ChowYun: Someone else needs to cover for teemo creates breathing room if your team wouldnt be dumb enough to get caught all the time
[4:04:14] Ebra: what an amazing game league is, so much fun!
[4:04:16] SquiZNovus: you pushing gets pressure... they will have to leave something to deal with you. If you dont push than it doesn nothing
[4:04:17] Punketsu: the S tho very nice
[4:04:19] teeders: happens brotha
[4:04:21] Rezzak77: wait how did you lose that first game? lol
[4:04:23] psychic_ward: You had 7 of the teams 15 kills......
[4:04:24] Punketsu: I can never get S on top
[4:04:24] Sha1yen: jingosaurus it's one of those things where it should work in theory, but teammates are too bad for theory to actually apply
[4:04:25] sunflower204: probably need to play a snowbally character or a heavy split pusher
[4:04:25] appaomega: Months ago you mentioned setting personal goals in LOL games instead of trying to win. Is that something you still want to do?
[4:04:32] Punketsu: LMAO
[4:04:33] OhTenGeneral: Not much can carry against a 2/12 bot lane
[4:04:36] afreak10: same thing , team throwing
[4:04:36] Punketsu: I felt that
[4:04:40] johnfive21: league of legends happened
[4:04:42] Haeher: LUL
[4:04:42] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: rooBobble
[4:04:47] Khorne1977: LUL
[4:04:48] 14neo: @Rezzak77 jungler Yi did not join in team fights + Sylas feedin'
[4:04:49] Opoppopro: have you thought of playing with a duo with actual hands?
[4:04:49] Kaleith: MYAAA wtf
[4:04:51] afreak10: MYAAA MYAAA
[4:04:58] SquiZNovus: If you really want to carry 1v9 than play Darius/Camille
[4:04:59] Yuvu5: Yuvu5 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 102 months! Good Luck JP!
[4:04:59] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Yuvu5! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[4:05:00] JimWho: @diabetic_cheezeburger ijpH
[4:05:00] OdinX1: Chat, i played one game and absolutely steamrolled
[4:05:01] jingosaurus: @Sha1yen 100%. its a catch 22, basically what creates "elo hell"
[4:05:01] MADCERBERO: new season same league POGGERS
[4:05:06] StarPogPlatinum: Botlane were a mess in these two games
[4:05:10] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: @JimWho fren rooHug
[4:05:10] SquiZNovus: If you win, you win the game. If you lose, you useless
[4:05:16] JimWho: ijpH
[4:05:20] Darkaros: On one hand, more pushing, on the other hand it's not like you can save a game where you're doing 50% of the work, solo, of an entire team of 5
[4:05:22] Sha1yen: @itmeJP maybe find a duo? That way you know atleast 1 person on the team has a brain roo5Head
[4:05:30] Ihazarus: is this the PJSalt game for JP that he brings up on DF?
[4:05:51] johnfive21: day 1 of the season is always weird though, lot of ELOs smushed together
[4:06:03] psychic_ward: so the rest of the team was 8  and 23
[4:06:15] HoboCarwash: @itmejp do you ever consider typing and trying to tell people what to do? I stopped playing league many years ago because of teammates but I’m just curious
[4:06:17] Price_FTW: i like watch JP's league streams because it lets me know my reality of getting fed and still not being able to carry because of "team" isnt just my own
[4:06:19] hollysephiroth: for some reason its really fun watching JP play LoL
[4:06:20] Darkdevilly: well at least title of the stream is correct so far LUL , hope it wont become truth
[4:06:22] jingosaurus: @Sha1yen i have duo'd with my brother before and he definitely doesn't have a brain I learned. Not always effective strategy :P
[4:06:25] Punketsu: Sett might be comfortable for you
[4:06:25] Z3r0Fear: Mundo is pretty good
[4:06:28] Kaleith: CrungoSpin DEMACIA CrungoSpin
[4:06:31] SquiZNovus: You wont carry as a garen either
[4:06:32] Saryuken: tahm gets kited a lot
[4:06:34] Nickonil: danBlank guess i'll que up a match and feed danPalm
[4:06:37] afreak10: the issue with kench is team pressure if u join fights
[4:06:40] Samstein: ye but Garen does suck against teemo though
[4:06:52] Sha1yen: jingosaurus I mean.. You have to ofcourse verify the pressence of said brain before queuing rooDerp
[4:07:04] Wildside1177: Are the main characters in Arcane good in LoL? I know 0 about the game.
[4:07:06] RoniBranco: You need to master a carry top D:
[4:07:09] Punketsu: Braum POG
[4:07:19] SquiZNovus: Objectives > KDA
[4:07:20] TB_Honest: 0-2 20% there baybeeeee
[4:07:22] ZG_KiLiT: seeing you play LoL makes me wanna maybe dip back into it after like... 7 years, but at the same time I feel the anguish of your team pulling your good games down way too much FeelsBadMan
[4:07:25] Sha1yen: Wildside1177 Vi is a high-tier jungler, Jinx is a mid-tier marksman
[4:07:26] 14neo: nah you had several deaths in the first game no?
[4:07:31] Fiendmaw: Irelia top?
[4:07:36] TheZander: irelia eats mundo alive
[4:07:37] omgitsjason: for mundo yes
[4:07:41] jingosaurus: go darius COPIUM
[4:07:43] WaxCourant: @Wildside1177 They're generally solid. Honestly, every character in the game is reasonably competitive.
[4:07:44] MellonFarm: Ye, she goes bork and you're perma dead
[4:07:46] Blexun: maybe early, you get big eventually
[4:07:46] Wildside1177: @Sha1yen Cool thank you
[4:07:51] omgitsjason: garen works
[4:07:54] Punketsu: that irelia miiiight be a problem
[4:07:58] StarPogPlatinum: Their team yikes
[4:08:01] OhTenGeneral: Garen's pretty decent into her
[4:08:01] afreak10: LUL
[4:08:05] Punketsu: oh jeez
[4:08:07] Sonatta: engage the meta!
[4:08:08] Athleon: some good ol' spin to win
[4:08:14] Z3r0Fear: Yeah that's a meta pick 100% lol
[4:08:17] teeders: diana jg can solo baron at 2 items
[4:08:19] Sha1yen: Oh god a Yuumi
[4:08:20] jingosaurus: woah picking the meta what a bold strategy
[4:08:21] DagooX: the metaverse Kappa

[4:08:22] DrYaguar: Diana too, scary team
[4:08:31] Darkdevilly: ignite?
[4:08:32] Haeher: yumi this could be pain or great YEP
[4:08:32] afreak10: Yuumi KEKW
[4:08:35] Sha1yen: Litteraly number 1 on my list of champs I hate to have on my team
[4:08:37] Price_FTW: its wild to watch JP's games because hes top... in my own games the game is decided by which top won about 90 percent of the time regardless of the other lanes
[4:08:38] Z3r0Fear: Diana got some buffs
[4:08:42] schwed15: their team squish though
[4:08:43] Fiendmaw: Is Diana jungling on that team?
[4:08:47] Twizzlar: yuumi on garen can do stuff
[4:08:53] jjonnej: protip for garen. Spin

[4:09:19] Debazor: I just started LoL today after a 7 year hiatus. God have mercy on my soul lol
[4:09:24] Saryuken: probably some smurf...
[4:09:37] Sha1yen: Debazor Welcome to litterally nothing being like it used to
[4:09:44] Jukettaja: Let's see if this Pyke is passing by on his way to Challenger
[4:09:46] Darkaros: COPIUM maybe Garen will get a t1 tower
[4:09:48] Opoppopro: @Debazor i will pray for you ratirlMeditate

[4:34:44] m_Varenx: naah, if you keep winning you will get 50-60 LPs, jump divisions, etc.
[4:34:47] 14neo: so we have less experience with Garen but it might have to be one of the answers we need to get placed well COPIUM

[4:35:00] sunflower204: low rank more fun than high rank anyway Kappa
[4:35:11] AtheistVeganNihilist: Pretty sure Fairlight also placed bronze so it seems like that’s where high silver is being placed
[4:35:27] AtheistVeganNihilist: Though it’s obviously MMR dependent

[4:39:26] freaker286: Garen or Darius, ya
[4:39:32] Gank4CE1: KEKHeim
[4:39:32] ElSpartin: Garen-teed a good time
[4:39:35] schwed15: mods can we get other predictions once the tower one is done like next darg or baron or how many kills jp will end with
[4:39:35] freaker286: Darius is Garen with blood

[4:41:23] Faintlich: They have lost their mind tho, they watch Tyler 1
[4:41:29] SlCKNESS: keep in mind League's MMR system rewards multiple wins in a row quite heavily, so if u go 8/2 u might hit high silver
[4:41:30] SamMFJackson: yeah, but tyler1 has much better mods KEKW
[4:41:43] ErikThe_Viking: I have 324 points, I have lost everything beliving JP ijpCRY

[4:42:04] konvay: Hmm
[4:42:05] epicshoo: UHMM
[4:42:06] Darkaros: I can do consecutive predictions in one game, but our chat doesn't react fast enough with short timers
[4:42:13] Darkaros: you cannot have multiple simulatenous predictions
[4:42:17] Kaleith: @Darkaros he's not asking multiple at the same time, but smaller predictions over the course of the game
[4:42:29] EnvyUK: Blaming chat now huh
[4:42:32] konvay: it's our faults PepeHands
[4:42:33] epicshoo: stop being slow chat ijpCRY

[4:42:48] NayaVoras: blaming chat now :(
[4:42:55] Duncain: ya, we all boomer here
[4:42:58] foodservice: modCheck
[4:43:01] 14neo: not that many people participate in predictions generally
[4:43:08] Darkaros: ^
[4:43:17] 14neo: when too many are done -> with short timers especially
[4:43:18] fladerade: @itmeJP do you have matrix thoughts?
[4:43:29] freaker286: Is worth a doge if yhey dont trade
[4:43:30] BaronofDreams: garen jungle works
[4:43:32] freaker286: ya, it is
[4:43:33] DrewGamer: you can Jungle Garen if it comes down to it
[4:43:33] ritchie313: in this elo yeah
[4:43:34] fladerade: yup
[4:43:35] asj1410: the least is supp
[4:43:38] Price_FTW: jungle is just the most abused lane
[4:43:46] TETLegion: i would love to play jungle shyvanna every time
[4:43:46] SlCKNESS: pretty sure dodges count as losses in placement matches?
[4:43:53] Felgrun: Yeah jungle and adc i feel like
[4:43:56] Darkaros: This bet will stand for next game
[4:43:56] freaker286: Not one, but mltiple
[4:43:59] SlCKNESS: or is that just for promos?
[4:44:05] Khuja__: jungle players get a lot of shit from the rest of the team...
[4:44:09] Gank4CE1: jp react to Quin while we wait? PepeLaugh
[4:44:14] asj1410: u lose ip when dodge
[4:44:14] metz0mat: they used to not count at all in placements, did they change that?
[4:44:20] SoulCrusher842: I like jungle because you can kinda control the game and help lanes 4Head
[4:44:25] Netoen: Let's do a minesweeper in meanwhile ?
[4:44:27] everkn0wn: I think they do
[4:44:34] Harakens: yeh they always did don't know if it still works like that
[4:44:34] SlCKNESS: no, i think I got confused and it's just in promos
[4:44:35] Price_FTW: honestly jungle kinda hard and the entire team gangbangs jungle if the game goes awry so not worth to play
[4:44:38] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:44:42] afreak10: F
[4:44:50] Akizea: it takes away autofill when you play the match out
[4:44:53] ElSpartin: how are we autofill during placements? that's insane
[4:44:54] Faintlich: do you lose less rank if you get autofilled and lose
[4:44:56] Price_FTW: new game Q screen UI is terrible imo
[4:44:58] Archangel3003: @itmeJP Did you see that BioWare said the Mass Effect 5 poster has at least 5 surprises?
[4:45:02] jjoseneves: yes its the  most hard and stressfull role imo,i feel better losing in top lane than winning in jungle. strange game lol is
[4:45:08] Harakens: 3 game losing streak in the new season rn FeelsDankMan
[4:45:12] Darkaros: The game after I'll put up multiple predictions in one game with short timers. Probably FB -> first t2 tower killed -> win. See if chat can actually keep up PepeLaugh
[4:45:17] Convectt: you got 2 boxes JP

[4:49:42] DawnofFrost_art: The biggest thing to know about JG is its a mind game. An has an extremely high skill ceiling @itmeJP
[4:49:45] SamMFJackson: bad clear, and your passive basically wont work
[4:49:46] WantedOne: in nova scotia we getting warm winter, kinda nice lol

[4:50:11] Fiendmaw: Do you have warwick? He's pretty easy?
[4:50:14] CadaverLuke: many champs simply cannot jungle. they are too slow and auto-lose.
[4:50:20] 14neo: Garen skin! ijpPOGGERS
[4:50:21] epicshoo: is starcraft garen still available?

[4:50:50] Price_FTW: id 100 percent take longer Q times if it meant no one got autofilled tbh its infuriating to lose due to someone not knowing how to play the champs or position and not having and option not to. everyone is a victim when anyone gets autofilled

[5:06:09] CamberCYM: why does league chat always go 100 miles per hour towards hostility? like... there's never benefit of the doubt given, always flame
[5:06:09] Bucket_AU: Looking like a mute game LUL
[5:06:21] Barba06: that's why he's losing his own LUL
[5:06:23] KAHVITEK: Salt and Sanctuary KEKW
[5:06:25] ShereKhanXD: this is why I mute team chat every game
[5:06:27] qyang1212: welcome to league of legends
[5:06:40] BlueSapphyre: chat should just auto mute.
[5:06:49] DigitalShiver: ive had players flame me for not pinging MIA when shen ults
[5:06:59] s_k_o_m: i would love to see chat gone in LOL, they're the dumbest bunch of people lacking any mental, lets not even talk introspection ;D
[5:07:10] Ryuenjin: wait, when's he going to flame the rest of his team for getting 4v1'd when they didn't ping?
[5:07:14] psychic_ward: I think the salt is everywhere. ijpS
[5:07:17] Ryuenjin: The Fizz that is

[5:08:03] bairdman: early ninja tabi would be great
[5:08:06] SamMFJackson: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3
[5:08:23] Dbrn47: @CamberCYM Because that's just 'competitive game' culture online.  Just think, there's already shit talking in person during sports and sometimes even board games, but in person there's only so much you can say before you get punched.
[5:08:24] teeders: /mute all is $
[5:08:27] ShereKhanXD: muteall and mute pings when someone "?" on someone when they make a mistake
[5:08:30] robertoredd: I've gotten matched with way less toxic games this season- and probably 50% have even had genuinely nice people. I think the more honors you receive the more you get matched with those who get honored
[5:09:00] bairdman: oh my b, idk i always confuse the armor boots with the name ninja tabi
[5:09:08] freka_man: mid just died to enemy support

[5:44:00] Felgrun: Was Tahm banned?
[5:44:01] Athleon: eh garen is pretty straightforward you'll have it down in a couple games
[5:44:04] aircable: why half the champion reword/released in the last two years have 3 movement abilities and stealth
[5:44:14] Baske_T: @SamMFJackson JP doesn't feel like he carries with Tahm
[5:44:15] SinkingWings: no wonder ur tryna press 3 instead of E
[5:44:15] WantedOne: @SamMFJackson first 2 loss he was amazing, but others threw. so hes goign for a top that can do more carry

[5:51:58] Dredstryde: Gacha games elling Darkaros for monet?
[5:52:01] titanodin: @AinzN thats what i heard
[5:52:11] Dredstryde: typing is hard sometimes >_>

[5:54:53] RitzC: diary of a wimpy kid lmao
[5:54:55] Darkaros: Sakkyoku in that case they got rooted
[5:55:00] Baske_T: FYI JP you aren't landing your Q silence because you are hitting E before you hit them
[5:55:01] Rancimus: Archangel3003 garen has aspd/crit scaling
[5:55:04] Dredstryde: @Sakkyoku In that instance he was clearing a ward and got rooted
[5:55:08] Kyrvix: Akali E has the highest damage, even over most ults in the game
[5:55:22] afreak10: and that's with baron buff
[5:55:27] ElSpartin: not a team fight at least
[5:55:28] Darkaros: OOOO MF did 0 damage with ult
[5:55:32] Archangel3003: @Rancimus Ah ok, that makes sense then. I've not played Garen in years so forgot how he works fully
[5:55:46] freka_man: should have used baron to split push
[5:55:48] Omakie: so they threw
[5:55:51] Omakie: then you threw
[5:55:56] Omakie: now its there turn to throw
[5:56:06] Noytron: Honestly i think that's smart :p if she dies she does 0 dmg anyway
[5:56:15] Kyrvix: Just need to Hit the Q silence then use E
[5:56:15] kounounou: Well it was jhin and Akali vs all of you but ur team somehow got scared xD
[5:56:19] Nogardknight: what
[5:56:23] DoggyP0O: I don't think people jhin is smart enough to bait
[5:56:24] Baske_T: he tried to flash ult, but missed
[5:56:25] Levyathin: He wants to flash r KEKW
[5:56:31] RitzC: uhh did he think he had ult
[5:56:33] GibbyTheGamer: has @itmejp watched the new cinematic trailer for lol?
[5:56:34] Kyrvix: His ult was down

[5:56:40] freka_man: bot wave needs pushing
[5:56:42] Kyrvix: We've all done it
[5:56:50] kounounou: Jhin got caught waaay out of position and your team was like "Not punished you shall be forgiven" XD
[5:57:00] Big_Headed_Gamer: who? the akali?

[5:57:18] Omakie: akali 5 man ult in 5
[5:57:19] ElSpartin: Jhin be baiting for a closeline
[5:57:24] titanodin: @itmeJP gotta defend
[5:57:27] luzacullus: malz needs to press R on Akali no other way
[5:57:49] KAHVITEK: Damn that Garen skin brings back memories

[5:59:13] kounounou: That malz is why i avoid ranked :D
[5:59:17] afreak10: MC syndrome
[5:59:24] Darkaros: did he even have 9 assists
[5:59:25] Levyathin: Its cause they think they know how to play KEKW
[5:59:26] iUncouth: yep that's why they never leave that elo
[5:59:28] Highspring: People in low elo somehow have giant egos
[5:59:30] TheHolyPuppy: Basically he stole 2 kills of your team
[5:59:31] Victo0: #adcmains
[5:59:31] kounounou: Makes a mistake -> blames someone else for smth else XD
[5:59:44] afreak10: that shield geez
[5:59:45] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[5:59:50] Ebra: OOOO
[6:00:05] WantedOne: @kounounou good ol' deflection. used everywhere haha
[6:00:08] roflrabbit: Remember beeing a dapper catfish, eating Urgot and Teemo for lunch? :D
[6:00:14] Levyathin: I recommend mordekaiser @itmeJP
[6:00:21] Pickedaname_: High skill Garen is resetting auto attacks with Q
[6:00:25] Pickedaname_: Das it
[6:00:31] Gank4CE1: just OSFrog until your 10 games imo
[6:00:31] Kyrvix: Shen is a good pick top
[6:00:35] Victo0: @itmeJP you want malphite, it doesn't matter if good or abd game, you ult will still decide fights
[6:00:39] freka_man: well ur suppose to split with ur e as fast as possible
[6:00:39] jmcarless: there's always malphite, he has the ultimate "team do thing" button
[6:00:43] freka_man: then go to ur team
[6:00:44] TheHolyPuppy: u dont need to play meta champions since you will climb with every champ. it always balance around 50% - just stay positive
[6:00:50] kounounou: I like the overextended top that dies 1vs1 to his laner and immediately starts pinging his jungler XD
[6:00:52] ltnager: @itmejp you should also, if you want to, check after games if you played versus arranged teams. rito loves to setup 5randoms against teams with out of game voice and trained team play. totall unfair BS. -. -
[6:00:59] Big_Headed_Gamer: what these lower elos don't understand is that 90% of the time it's never anyone feeding. they are just bad. you can feed all game any make a hell of a comeback. high elo players do it all the time.
[6:01:02] monamibob: just spin that blade baby

[6:01:25] KerwinBJones: Yeah, when I play top lane, I try to pick a champ that can be a playmaker late game.
[6:01:27] Gank4CE1: winnable PauseChamp
[6:01:32] Convectt: BASE
[6:01:33] Levyathin: The base KEKW
[6:01:47] KerwinBJones: So that even if early game is rough, the enemy team still has to respect you.
[6:01:48] luzacullus: FLY YOU FOOLS!

[6:03:39] afreak10: top dead
[6:03:42] kounounou: with an our of place bear and a free baron

[6:06:43] iUncouth: @Dredstryde his team's base was crawling with minions at one point, they could have 100% ended
[6:06:48] Kyrvix: Galeforce
[6:06:50] titanodin: its good to have a handful of champs you can play
[6:06:55] azuae: Cho is my favorite, but I'm just bad
[6:07:22] Dredstryde: @iUncouth reading the game and getting everyone to make that decision is part of what makes closing at this level hard.
[6:07:28] DrewGamer: @azuae Hey don't sell yourself short, being good (or bad) doesn't invalidate what you enjoy playing the most.
[6:07:38] stringz: stoopid Jhin LUL
[6:07:39] freka_man: niceee

[6:09:52] afreak10: oh no
[6:09:59] Levyathin: Look at map choke points for the objects you need
[6:10:06] Buttzyy: whenever you get it pushed in like that and they respawn if you have a pushing lane towards there base just push it further for more pressure and presence because someone has to deal with the wave
[6:10:11] Darkaros: probably use wards to setup for top tower or bot engage
[6:10:21] titanodin: @itmeJP a ward video might help a lot
[6:10:33] Farnzy11: MF and Malz ult are gonna win or lose this game
