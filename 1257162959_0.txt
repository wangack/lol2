But hey personal opinion.

[1:25:55] zombo_com: his q thing
[1:25:56] titanodin: his q steals movespeed
[1:25:56] ChurchOfKenny: he gets a speed boost after hitting QW
[1:25:57] zombo_com: takes speed
[1:25:59] SamMFJackson: his q speeds him up
[1:26:02] RlDennis: He gains some movement speed from using his Q. It used to steal movement speed
[1:26:02] wbladez: he steals your movement speed
[1:26:03] Rezz284: his Q gives him YOUR speed
[1:26:04] jimmichristensen: it slowes you his q
[1:26:05] CadaverLuke: his Q steals movespeed
[1:26:06] MilkNPC: his q steals movement speed

[1:26:25] Haeher: LUL
[1:26:27] titanodin: push and buy?
[1:26:28] RlDennis: Just hard push and reset
[1:26:49] zombo_com: has lee even ganked top yet
[1:26:53] NutritionalNick: league is demoralizing
[1:26:56] RlDennis: He hasn't LUL
[1:26:59] decdice: nope
[1:27:00] RlDennis: Morgana has though
[1:27:12] zombo_com: what is skarner
[1:27:14] zombo_com: doing
[1:27:24] zombo_com: trying to gank a pushed lane
[1:27:28] RoboticBiotic777: hey @itmejp have you tried Darius yet or are you not really interested? he can be a pretty decent top carry.
[1:27:31] titanodin: skarner dont know when to gank
[1:27:47] forkliftocuultist: he probably just wanted to drop rift
[1:27:48] zombo_com: skarner and zed now???
[1:27:55] titanodin: oh he had shelly
[1:28:08] ChowYun: Lmao.
[1:28:10] ChurchOfKenny: One Q then Ult and he's dead
[1:28:17] titanodin: now ult?
[1:28:22] robertoredd: an escape from tarkov reference?? in my title?? rooDab rooDab rooDab
[1:28:27] ChurchOfKenny: Q Ult Ignite for good measure
[1:28:31] Vashile: i liked wwhen you played Kayle top lane
[1:28:39] tglenn: plate gold at least
[1:28:45] uui23: skarner probably just wanted to drop skelly and get the tower money
[1:28:57] RlDennis: Wow, your bot lane is .. competent?
[1:29:19] SamMFJackson: you need to make sure you Q after his q hits, otherwise you still slow and hes even faster
[1:29:23] titanodin: your rich
[1:29:38] Rezz284: if you use your q before his hits you, you give him MORE move speed
[1:29:38] Haeher: I would go buy soon rooIsee
[1:29:50] RlDennis: They don't really have an easy lane either. both champs bot get outranged
[1:29:52] Madracah: shouldnt garens q dispell the slow?
[1:30:01] teeders: y
[1:30:04] RlDennis: He used Q before he got hit there
[1:30:08] uui23: not when he q before he gets hit
[1:30:24] RlDennis: LUL the Skarner
[1:30:31] titanodin: @Madracah his q is what gives garen move speed which in turn gives  maplh more move speed
[1:30:34] Khatangher: help skarner
[1:30:41] Ceratic: lol this Skarner is pure comedy
[1:30:50] ShrowdArrow: clearly "preventing the malph from porting"
[1:30:52] Haeher: Skarner always coming far too soon LUL
[1:30:53] RlDennis: @titanodin They removed the movement steal a while back I'm pretty sure
[1:31:03] DrYaguar: KEKW
[1:31:07] DrewGamer: @titanodin yeah if you can bait the malph Q out first, garen can then use his own Q to remove the slow
[1:31:14] titanodin: @RlDennis so is it flat move speed now?
[1:31:18] IToldYouItsTaken: malf can be annoying, but as garen he literally cannot solo kill you
[1:31:23] Rave_Digger: That Malph isnt gonna be spamming laugh after JP TP's back with 4k gold LUL
[1:31:29] maaadmarty: Malph still steals movement speed with his Q so it can be tricky to catch him
[1:31:38] titanodin: @RlDennis because he definitly is gaining move speed on q
[1:31:39] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:31:41] RlDennis: @titanodin I think so? I remember they either changed the wording of it or just flat movement speed. Was a few seasons ago though
[1:31:44] Haeher: 3.5 so rich rooVV
[1:32:03] slycefyre: @Rave_Digger malph probably had a lot of gold as well, malph hadn't backed for the same amount of time and hadn't died
[1:32:33] robertoredd: worth, you baited out his control ward
[1:32:36] uui23: well you got first tower gold though
[1:32:39] sunflower204: q can reset your auto to help you take that tower faster.
[1:32:42] afreak10: lvl 12
[1:33:21] Ceadeuss: 11 to 11 with a 1/1/1 kda
[1:33:22] Oglok_Pandra: Good Evening !

[1:34:01] birkhoms: jp feeding again? LUL
[1:34:09] titanodin: black cleaver is very good vs maplh
[1:34:19] RlDennis: @titanodin Actually, I think it was an update to the wording/functionality. It basically still does the same but they had to update it because spaghetti code. LUL
[1:34:20] Oglok_Pandra: damn I would love to have that CS... going back after a 5 year pause was rough
[1:34:30] DrewGamer: @birkhoms cohhSus 1 death is feeding now?
[1:34:31] zoalprime: Got a goal rank, JP?
[1:34:38] birkhoms: that skin is hot
[1:34:41] afreak10: nice
[1:34:57] Darkaros: @zoalprime Plat (but realistically happy with gold)
[1:35:14] birkhoms: @drewgamer for trolling purposes. sure
[1:35:39] RlDennis: Honestly, if you can reach gold. You can reach plat. The difference isn't as huge as something like Diamond > Challenger
[1:36:22] uui23: whenever you back just buy a pink and it will come naturally
[1:36:34] afreak10: idiot zed
[1:36:40] chikgila: LUL
[1:36:56] IToldYouItsTaken: skarner ults are always so amusing
[1:37:03] DrYaguar: LUL
[1:37:16] Sylarphile: how long is a season chat?
[1:37:26] RlDennis: Oh yeah, just buying a control ward whenever you have 75g leftover will be pretty good to start with
[1:37:32] ChowYun: Bronze arams, nice
[1:37:49] Gat0rCh0mp: @sylarphile pretty much the year
[1:38:01] DrewGamer: @Sylarphile usually ends sometime in november
[1:38:04] limneosgreen: this game is very low rank
[1:38:04] DawnofFrost_art: Yooo hes playing again :D
[1:38:13] Sylarphile: thanks
[1:38:18] Gat0rCh0mp: @sylarphile s12, 12th year of lol
[1:38:19] Omakie: you need to start getting in the habit in hard pushing side lanes jp and not grouping to aram mid unless its over a dragon or baron
[1:38:44] ChowYun: ^
[1:38:53] zombo_com: push bort
[1:39:05] RlDennis: One of the best things you can do right now is hard push a side lane. Then ward enemy jungle entrance to the river
[1:39:12] bairdman: fun lore, seraphine's stage she rides around on is made of the souls of skarner's kind
[1:39:13] EVILCRIKET: Woll JP's team win this
[1:39:17] DrYaguar: KEKW
[1:39:18] zombo_com: lol bruh
[1:39:19] Omakie: challenger zed
[1:39:20] Notenoughcoffee: i think he was pushing lanes yesterday guys
[1:39:21] Levyathin: My kinda guy KEKW
[1:39:23] WeeMr_Goodcat: gotta get in the habit of doing the things jp
[1:39:32] Tylerjsmith97: is JP playing against bots
[1:39:33] IToldYouItsTaken: bad zeds are something special
[1:39:33] afreak10: Top
[1:39:40] Tylerjsmith97: or what's with the names
[1:39:41] BlargMcBlarg: Special Zed KEKW
[1:39:49] Haeher: Zed my god just going kamikaze LUL
[1:40:06] zombo_com: you can probably 1v1 lee right now
[1:40:06] RlDennis: Those wards your team currently has in enemy red side jungle are pretty good. But there's no dragon to fight over. So blue side would be better
[1:40:15] jingosaurus: @Tylerjsmith97 theres a setting that makes all enemy players names their champions
[1:40:19] slycefyre: @Tylerjsmith97 you can make it so the game just displays the champ's name instead of the player's username
[1:40:22] RlDennis: But in general, those are good wards to have
[1:40:38] zombo_com: @RlDennis he just got bot tower cause of the wards with no issue
[1:41:09] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[1:41:09] IToldYouItsTaken: how many times are we gonna die under turret? - Zed, who's last death was under turret
[1:41:12] Dbrn47: Zed needs to quit pinging 'be careful' when he is the one constantly being caught
[1:41:26] RlDennis: @zombo_com Yeah, I'm not saying he should be warding blue side, only pointing out that there's not much to fight for objective wise bot side. (except for the one tower)
[1:41:29] zombo_com: it do be a vayne tho. so she can do well
[1:41:35] uui23: wow that cait just walked up and noone did anything LUL
[1:41:39] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[1:41:45] sunflower204: he was trying to look for an engage
[1:41:49] DrYaguar: a good malph ult and you're all deadd
[1:41:56] RlDennis: I feel like that Caitlyn would just die with a single Q ult
[1:42:00] Lutcha81: team is being poked to death
[1:42:11] sunflower204: they have way better engage with malph than your team
[1:42:12] epicshoo: poke city from the enemy monkaS
[1:42:18] afreak10: u have no opener to the group fight
[1:42:21] Khatangher: skarner grabs malphite hahaha
[1:42:22] RlDennis: LUL Sona
[1:42:28] IToldYouItsTaken: sona walked into pool LMAO
[1:42:29] Snowplex: why did skarner ult malph cirSlain
[1:42:33] Viktor616: This Sona is not looking at the screen
[1:42:35] zombo_com: time to push a lane
[1:42:43] Haeher: LUL your team looks like a headless chicken running back and forth getting poked by the enemy non-stop
[1:42:44] Darkaros: if it makes oyu feel better the enemy team was briefly dumb and ran away after getting an Ace KEKW
[1:42:57] titanodin: split push and hope they hold them long enough
[1:42:58] afreak10: they will just baron
[1:42:58] Darkaros: WTFF Why are they leaving it's just a Vayne
[1:43:04] sunflower204: malph is one of those champ who can lose the lane super hard and still be game changing late game
[1:43:05] DrewGamer: @Viktor616 sona doing her best lee sin impression LUL
[1:43:22] zombo_com: i dont understand how league placed one of my accounts silver 1, when I was facing people who were plat 2? and won and got an s+
[1:43:28] DawnofFrost_art: Did JP say yesterday he wanted to find a carry champ to play top?
[1:43:30] Esge: imo, sona pick into cait, lux and morgana wasn't ideal
[1:43:32] Greedlegion: jp already sounding like a veteran lol player right there LUL
[1:43:35] RlDennis: LUL
[1:43:35] afreak10: LUL
[1:43:38] sunflower204: that zed doesn't even know how to combo?
[1:43:44] Tylerjsmith97: why did zed go in
[1:43:47] Fiendmaw: Zed thinks he can just 1v5
[1:43:48] Reijm11: he went in 1v4 there why
[1:43:54] Haeher: Zed going 1v3 LUL
[1:43:55] Darkaros: lol_DawnOfFrost ya i dunno if he wants suggestions
[1:43:58] Darkaros: he was thinking of picking up Irelia
[1:44:09] BlueSpringFM: Climbing in team games is tough. Coz while you are better, they  might be where they belong
[1:44:11] zombo_com: nice
[1:44:12] sunflower204: he could've at least trade lux off if he comboed right
[1:44:16] AdrenALI_N: idk, that Zed is a really proficient feeder finameNom
[1:44:19] afreak10: useless team
[1:44:20] StarPogPlatinum: why watching pros when you can watch these bronze wild games
[1:44:20] Pingues: isn't  malp stackinga armour just unkillable for your team?
[1:44:33] Tylerjsmith97: @pingues yep
[1:44:39] zombo_com: he has black cleaver tho
[1:44:42] zombo_com: so that helps a little
[1:44:43] snyft: top bundle with irelia for 650 rp
[1:44:49] DrewGamer: @Pingues vayne can still shred him but she has to actually be able to stay alive 😅
[1:44:59] Tylerjsmith97: steraks is very useful
[1:44:59] RlDennis: @Pingues for Zed yeah. Vayne does enough true damage and Garen shreds armor with Black Cleaver and E
[1:45:01] zombo_com: yeah sterak is a good choice
[1:45:06] ChurchOfKenny: Vayne does true damage and Zed has Armor pen so Malphite isn't super tanky
[1:45:36] Pingues: i didn't play in a while but thanks for answers
[1:45:41] DawnofFrost_art: Ah, gotcha I was just gonna suggest something but I don't wanna trigger him more than his teamates already are senpaiBokay @Darkaros
[1:45:43] bairdman: or do what an assassin is supposed to do and actuallt kill someone, 4 times hees gone all in and enemy just walks away
[1:45:45] Haeher: Zed be feeding that enemy team nice and plump rooVV
[1:45:54] zombo_com: garen carry
[1:45:57] Levyathin: gj on that!
[1:46:01] Fiendmaw: The cockblock
[1:46:02] RlDennis: I think you could've fought him still
[1:46:07] scooterjr37: that fucxking turret is still up
[1:46:11] Pariston_Hill: Jp you are real good at this game
[1:46:12] zombo_com: with steraks its gonna be nicer
[1:46:12] RlDennis: You're pretty strong at this point
[1:46:24] afreak10: lux would have interrupted
[1:46:28] Reijm11: you outclass your own team alot
[1:46:38] sunflower204: you need something to help you get in position quicker in fight
[1:46:39] zombo_com: well he also never really got ganked
[1:46:40] Darkaros: JP will ask explicitly for suggestions if he wants them I'm sure, he's already thinking about Irelia MmmHmm
[1:46:43] ChurchOfKenny: Should of went full damage instead of defence considering you will need to carry this
[1:46:45] zombo_com: cause they were feeding on bot and mid
[1:46:45] Haeher: JP singularly carrying the game again you back is gonna start hurting real bad rooVV
[1:46:54] RlDennis: Vayne's .. alright. I can't fault a bronze adc for not flashing a Malphite ultimate too much
[1:47:06] Boonia: Hi Jp and Chat I havent been here so long that Jp has join the Garen club

[1:53:19] birkhoms: gg, played really well
[1:53:24] shoooti: Garen main?
[1:53:24] OdinX1: Yup, thats why malphite might be really good for you to play too, Ult into the backline and just fuckign explode them
[1:53:26] RlDennis: After Caitlyn dies they don't have consistent damage anymore, just burst (with the exception of Morg W) LUL
[1:53:35] afreak10: Garen got so much impact on team fights
[1:53:39] Omakie: 25
[1:53:47] Kniqhtmare_: 23
[1:53:56] afreak10: MF time
[1:54:01] RlDennis: It is one of the most satisfying things to land big ults with champs like Malphite, Ornn, Gnar, Kennen
[1:54:02] Achubra: surely you wont run into an hour long game today, that would be crazy
[1:54:06] Omakie: i think 15 is the break even point
[1:54:20] SamMFJackson: they cant be as bad as the S Leona
[1:54:21] StarPogPlatinum: Jhin ?
[1:54:21] ladderoat: Leona PTSD
[1:54:21] zombo_com: me as a one trick xerath support...
[1:54:21] RlDennis: Akali?
[1:54:24] afreak10: jhin?
[1:54:31] GibbyTheGamer: who has Jp played so far?
[1:54:37] Derilich: did they nerf lethal tempo tahm kench?
[1:54:37] afreak10: double shaco wow
[1:54:39] BlargMcBlarg: new poll: Will the support suck? KEKW
[1:54:46] Omakie: @zombo_com 1 trick xerath can take you far
[1:54:49] Invess: benched
[1:54:50] Darkaros: @GibbyTheGamer today or all-time? he just did his first game today as Garen
[1:54:51] AlanRLD: yes
[1:54:51] DrewGamer: they benched the kench Sadge
[1:54:52] RlDennis: @afreak10 Good, I hate that champ LUL
[1:54:53] OdinX1: Lux is fucking stupid strong
[1:54:54] ritchie313: yup and super easy to play
[1:54:55] Kniqhtmare_: defitnely not
[1:54:56] OdinX1: at any role
[1:54:56] Yceicle: More than pyke?
[1:54:57] epicshoo: i feel like you see more lux than jhin
[1:54:57] Infidel_Art: Pretty much after all the buffs
[1:55:01] OdinX1: Mid, Support doesnt matter
[1:55:08] OdinX1: 2 person root, insane range, control on E
[1:55:11] IToldYouItsTaken: why wont they give her fucking ult an actual cooldown
[1:55:12] GibbyTheGamer: @darkaros all time
[1:55:12] afreak10: @afreak10 haha ijpNODDERS
[1:55:14] CorduroyCashley: Flexible first pick, too.
[1:55:14] Kniqhtmare_: shes really popular and strong not msot broken at all
[1:55:19] mastermind2563: She is also the most mained champ in the game
[1:55:24] Oglok_Pandra: At least she has no hp
[1:55:26] RlDennis: I used to play her mid so much back in like Season 3
[1:55:28] OdinX1: Low key why i play her lmao
[1:55:33] sunflower204: she's only broken if she can aim Kappa
[1:55:38] Ozoaken: you havent seen a good camille yet have you?
[1:55:39] ChowYun: Cait lux vs mf zil. Good luck
[1:55:45] afreak10: her toolkit is too strong yep
[1:55:46] Invess: whenever I see her smiling face I can't help but smile myself tho
[1:55:52] flyscmusic: Olaf SMOrc
[1:55:59] Gat0rCh0mp: A silver LeBlanc monkaW
[1:56:01] SamMFJackson: olaf? good luck miss fortune
[1:56:03] RlDennis: Well then you guys are gonna need some grievous wounds LUL
[1:56:06] Omakie: zilean is insanely good if your adc is good
[1:56:10] Darkaros: GibbyTheGamer Lots of: Kayle, Tahm Kench, Garen, Mundo, MF, Trist; a bit of: Ashe, Teemo and a few other ADCs
[1:56:11] uhhgriz: Lol I just played my first game of LoL and man I think I'm done with the game didn't even do that bad and got spammed and ppl are really fucking toxic holy shit in non ranked too
[1:56:13] Omakie: but really realyl depends on the adc
[1:56:14] Boonia: if zil can land duoble bombs he is godly
[1:56:16] Invess: zil vgu incoming
[1:56:16] Fiendmaw: Surprised Zilean is used nowadays
[1:56:16] zombo_com: Xerath >
[1:56:20] OhTenGeneral: Zilean can do some fucked up things in the right comp. This comp isn't that comp though
[1:56:30] StarPogPlatinum: @Gat0rCh0mp Isn't she super safe if you know how to play her ?
[1:56:37] zombo_com: @XclusiveGriz first time
[1:56:39] IToldYouItsTaken: zilean is decent against their bot lane, can't get sniped at least
[1:56:39] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:56:41] OdinX1: Welcome to league, mobas in particular, but league is really bad about that
[1:56:41] robertoredd: @itmeJP try out caitlyn and jhin! they're really fun and while i'm an anivia main, those are my favorite two adc's
[1:56:52] sunflower204: @XclusiveGriz I would suggest aram, people are usually more chill there :)
[1:56:56] Boonia: inb4 he ques back up and carries so hard he gets addicted
[1:57:00] sckeperz: @XclusiveGriz Same just about alt f4'd because i was the bad one with the least deaths because i didnt have the same kills as the others
[1:57:01] RlDennis: Would you buy Serpent's Fang just for Lux shield?
[1:57:08] marlkarx_: Damn I feel so good since I gave up on league, but know I kinda wanna play again, f this
[1:57:10] teffy42: man I'm glad I learned to play League 10 years ago when everyone was bad at it
[1:57:11] Cronopolis: Blocking team and enemy chat in League is recommended :)
[1:57:11] Alfeana: I only play aram and there is very little toxicity that i experience
[1:57:12] Chaocc: well jp is one of the toxic ones lol
[1:57:12] RlDennis: Mostly for some lane pressure
[1:57:15] Dbrn47: Yeah, it doesn't matter if it's your first actual video game ever played, you will get berated in a moba.
[1:57:16] Tronix_604: toxicity is gonna get worse over the next 48hrs with all the ppl placing in Iron-low bronze and just giving up and not giving a shit anymore KEKW
[1:57:19] birkhoms: @xclusivegriz well that is league in a nutshell
[1:57:29] OdinX1: comet is free with your E i think? idk why honestly i dont play alot of MF
[1:57:29] Omakie: jp is not toxic in comparison
[1:57:32] uhhgriz: @sckeperz my support got pulled and died 5 times then went mid and never came back LOL
[1:57:32] titanodin: comet alway hits from your make it rain
[1:57:38] afreak10: ijpONEGUY
[1:57:38] revroom: @XclusiveGriz you were blessed, some people need month, years to get the full league experience and quit
[1:57:42] RlDennis: Arcane comet doesn't exactly benefit from Lethality anyway. @itmeJP Comet is just extra poke for an easier lane
[1:57:42] OhTenGeneral: You've typed some pretty toxic stuff but yeah I've seen a LOT worse
[1:57:50] issalga: zekeTHINK
[1:57:50] WantedOne: @Dbrn47 my experience is witnessing it in any team based game
[1:57:56] uhhgriz: @revroom lol might have only taken 1 game
[1:57:57] Brightbane: What tier is your toxicity d-s?
[1:57:58] jclester: Haha
[1:58:01] OdinX1: Thats pretty tame honestly
[1:58:01] ForestGumo: Jp isnt. Pj is.
[1:58:02] Dbrn47: yeah, any team game
[1:58:08] Gank4CE1: Salty = toxic Kappa
[1:58:22] Omakie: yep thats a every monday in league
[1:58:25] issalga: zekeWUT
[1:58:31] Gank4CE1: people overuse toxic just like cringe
[1:58:31] Fiendmaw: How are these people not banned
[1:58:32] Notenoughcoffee: i think you were banning Yone the most yesterady JP
[1:58:32] xPhire: Sounds like daily LoL business coxMuppet
[1:58:35] OdinX1: What you say is salty, and justified most of the time but idk about toxic lmao
[1:58:36] uhhgriz: I've watched jp play he is not even close to the ppl I just played with in nonranked game so
[1:58:38] sunflower204: sounds like a child who have no idea what they are actually saying.
[1:58:39] yanzz_: Its weird when you see it during ai games too lol
[1:58:42] juhayelen: Thats the foundation at this point
[1:58:49] afreak10: @Fiendmaw they got banned , 5 min after the match
[1:58:57] Hylotras: calling someone stupid is top 5% nicest people on league xD
[1:58:57] Alfeana: I never see any of that in league, I assume is happens alot more on Rift than Aram
[1:58:57] revroom: gonna have a hard time
[1:59:01] Chaocc: yea hbut it starts with stupid and ends with turning into a vegan
[1:59:02] OdinX1: Zil comes online at 2
[1:59:03] BaosilisK: jp is back coxHypers
[1:59:05] OdinX1: He seems to be okay too
[1:59:06] Boonia: Jp when are u gonna get crendor level of insults for people in league?
[1:59:08] Tronix_604: toxicity nowadays means you hurt someones overly soft sheltered feelings
[1:59:17] scooterjr37: cait lux combo is rough for short ranged adc's
[1:59:18] Gat0rCh0mp: zil needs LOL
[1:59:19] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[1:59:20] scooterjr37: like mf
[1:59:22] OdinX1: Like actually decent atleast from this early bit it seems like
[1:59:22] OhTenGeneral: HUGE
[1:59:23] Samstein: caitlyn is such a bitch in the laning phase at the beginning
[1:59:24] AdrenALI_N: justification through extremity is no justification at all, but I get you finameShrug
[1:59:26] WantedOne: cait is a bully
[1:59:27] OhTenGeneral: oops wrong chat
[1:59:28] flyscmusic: caitlyn lux monkaS
[1:59:31] Gat0rCh0mp: zil needs lvl 2
[1:59:36] SEye6: range poke is good
[1:59:39] OdinX1: i take it back
[1:59:40] afreak10: cait lux is tough lane
[1:59:44] sunflower204: I play aram only these days and rarely seen any toxicity there, and people are toxic in aram it's kind of funny.
[1:59:55] teffy42: just gotta endure this poke until Zilean pulls out some bullshit and wins for no reason
[2:00:07] Ozoaken: lux cait is lane domination
[2:00:11] WantedOne: this bot is either a duo, or real in sync
[2:00:19] Tronix_604: @Jontman42  LUL happens everytime, dont it KEKW
[2:00:30] scooterjr37: snare into trap is gg
[2:00:33] DigitalShiver: the way this lane works is that if you get hit by lux Q you are dead from 100% hp
[2:00:34] RlDennis: It's because both of them outrange you guys. Just kinda gotta bear with it until a jungle comes by to gank or one of them messes up
[2:00:40] DrewGamer: yeah he also got zilean as a support who offers like nothing against ranged matchups xD
[2:00:46] birkhoms: well, them pushing this hard makes them really gankable
[2:00:47] OdinX1: Do you usually not take heal as bot @itmeJP ? i dont pay attention to that alot of the time
[2:01:10] afreak10: top seems good
[2:01:24] sunflower204: Vi was doing a good job ganking
[2:01:26] Tronix_604: @OdinX1  meta has kind of changed for ADC summoners, heal is alright in laning phase, but exhaust is better for mid/late game
[2:01:33] OdinX1: Oh i see
[2:01:34] RlDennis: Sylas in your jjungle?
[2:01:35] OdinX1: Thank you
[2:01:40] scooterjr37: wont matter they they got all the wards
[2:01:43] OdinX1: I play support so i usually run ignite or exaust
[2:01:49] Gank4CE1: olaf is jg?
[2:01:54] OdinX1: But every now and then i get auto filled to bot and i run heal
[2:01:54] sunflower204: they are in your jungle
[2:02:01] Ceratic: what the heck was going on in jungle lol
[2:02:03] OdinX1: Guess im just not up with the times
[2:02:04] RlDennis: The enemy Sylas is either mega tilted or just trolling
[2:02:10] RlDennis: What is his cs ?
[2:02:18] revroom: remember, river brush warded
[2:02:22] Tronix_604: @OdinX1  well since exhaust doest a slow + 40% dmg reduction, its super OP now, even worth running dbl exh at times
[2:02:29] flyscmusic: yeah zilean doing alright
[2:02:33] StarPogPlatinum: You gotta endure the laning phase elaPain
[2:02:34] OdinX1: Noted
[2:02:41] OdinX1: Thanks for the advice/tip
[2:03:05] Gank4CE1: POGGERS
[2:03:08] revroom: aram bot
[2:03:13] afreak10: 2 kills not bad
[2:03:14] Arrietus: Arrietus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Whats the rank goal this season?
[2:03:14] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Arrietus! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[2:03:17] flyscmusic: alright dece
[2:03:25] Barba06: @revroom is that arab?
[2:03:32] sunflower204: only got one assist though :(
[2:03:59] RlDennis: No
[2:04:01] Tronix_604: bronze logic = 0 map awareness, play overly aggresive, stay in bronze forever, this enemy bot is hopeless lol
[2:04:02] OdinX1: Nah, theyre free
[2:04:04] Gank4CE1: only if you leave iirc
[2:04:09] Gank4CE1: leave shop area
[2:04:10] revroom: racist even @Barba06
[2:04:23] OdinX1: 4slot items are always free
[2:04:43] RlDennis: Jungle is kinda the same, You're just killing monsters while watching the lanes LUL
[2:04:44] sunflower204: Me, it's usually me that's bad :)
[2:04:51] Snowplex: what else are you gonna do? more farm cirFumo
[2:05:01] RlDennis: wow
[2:05:04] RlDennis: Lux didn't ult that
[2:05:09] OdinX1: I like to think im a slightly above average player, but its hard to climb as a support main
[2:05:15] afreak10: not 6 yeyt
[2:05:17] afreak10: yet*
[2:05:28] Desradin: Zilean with his ult is a pretty good counter against their ults, isn't he?
[2:05:33] RlDennis: She must've missed some exp then. Thought she was ahead
[2:05:38] RlDennis: He is yeah
[2:05:38] afreak10: at 6 both cait and lux ult would be lethal
[2:05:54] Tronix_604: @OdinX1  as long as you do what you can to reduce mistakes done by your adc, and just maintain vision with the occasional roam, you can carry as a support
[2:05:58] Dbrn47: @OdinX1 I used to think so too, but I was corrected and told that if I'm good I'd still carry
[2:05:59] Gank4CE1: lux LUL
[2:06:03] flyscmusic: LUL
[2:06:04] RlDennis: LUL
[2:06:07] Tronix_604: dont need aphromoo levels of outplays to carry as a support
[2:06:08] DrYaguar: KEKW
[2:06:14] Pewlitzer: that Vi was outta here LUL
[2:06:17] sunflower204: you ks her, you die Kappa
[2:06:17] Fiendmaw: Thanks Vi NODDERS
[2:06:17] RlDennis: I was just about to praise the Vi too LUL
[2:06:18] Esge: LUL
[2:06:18] Barba06: she was probably looking somewhere else LUL
[2:06:24] Desradin: he was probably looking somewhere else on the map LUL
[2:06:25] RlDennis: What is the Sylas doing?
[2:06:26] DrewGamer: WHAT
[2:06:32] StarPogPlatinum: My job's done PepeLaugh
[2:06:39] sunflower204: wasted flash
[2:06:40] RlDennis: @itmeJP Can you check Sylas' cs?
[2:06:42] Snowplex: cirDerp
[2:06:43] Boonia: how did that q hit
[2:06:44] Gank4CE1: Vi is in Arcane leave her alone
[2:06:44] DrYaguar: that Flash
[2:06:49] Gat0rCh0mp: lmao that vi flash
[2:06:49] flyscmusic: Vi flashing for the KS LUL
[2:06:50] OhTenGeneral: vi trying to flash steal that
[2:06:52] Khepri95: that Vi flash XD
[2:06:55] OdinX1: Maybe i just pick the wrong supports some of the time but i dont think thats ENTIRELY true @Dbrn47 If 3 otehr players on your team are bad and their lane snowballs theres not much you as a support, even with a very good ADC can do i feel
[2:07:03] afreak10: she died
[2:07:06] flyscmusic: now she is
[2:07:20] AdrenALI_N: i'm guessing if you're ballsy enough to pick a questionable character you either have no idea on the game, or have some skills to back it up finameLUL
[2:07:30] OdinX1: But, its also why i lean twords supports like lux, where i can pop off and carry
[2:07:31] Dbrn47: @OdinX1 I've never thought it was true, just what I've been told.  People think that if you are a good player and deserve a higher rank, you will carry from any posiiton.
[2:07:46] OdinX1: Theres probably SOME truth to it
[2:07:48] RlDennis: @OdinX1 correct. You kinda need to get involved with their lane earlier in those cases and rely on your adc to not die
[2:08:03] RlDennis: But, depending on randoms is a scary thing
[2:08:06] OdinX1: Yup
[2:08:10] Tronix_604: that is true, skill and familiarity will eventually overcome trolls
[2:08:18] OdinX1: Atleast im not alone in feeling that
[2:08:29] sunflower204: I would flash and ult as soon as zeal got a bind off
[2:08:36] Snowplex: lux too tanky
[2:08:40] Tronix_604: not at all, league is a cess pool of failure, none of us are making it, till we have
[2:08:52] Gank4CE1: did Zilean just give you xp? monkaHmm
[2:08:56] OdinX1: Doing not too bad concidering the matchup
[2:08:56] StarPogPlatinum: Olaf
[2:09:11] RlDennis: Olaf is the jungle, Sylas is the top. But I think the Sylas gave up after first blood
[2:09:12] Edot_KH: ya, they're getting dominated elsewhere on the map, lol
[2:09:23] OdinX1: Lux/cait is a really rough lane, and if they were playing better itd probably be impossible to win
[2:09:29] AdrenALI_N: well, at least we're providing a reasonable distraciotn then finameLUL
[2:09:53] RlDennis: Gnar is 3 levels up on Sylas LUL
[2:09:54] OdinX1: Lux gets a root cait should have a trap under your feet instantly and thatd be all she wrote
[2:09:55] Barba06: that gnar skin looks nice
[2:09:57] Tronix_604: 9 outta 10 times, you wont win a cait/lux lane, you have to just farm as best as possible and wait out lane phase
[2:10:34] afreak10: nice ult
[2:10:34] RlDennis: gj
[2:10:37] Tronix_604: maintain vision, last hit under tower, and farm for mid/late
[2:10:40] fyrepony9000: wow
[2:10:54] tglenn: good timing there
[2:11:01] SamMFJackson: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3 ijpPOGGERS ijpPOGGERS
[2:11:02] FyLaw95: bronze has improved over the years
[2:11:15] WantedOne: @FyLaw95 because now we got iron
[2:11:16] Sylarphile: POGGIES
[2:11:16] Gank4CE1: LUL
[2:11:17] afreak10: wow that clutch
[2:11:25] RlDennis: Wow, Vi won that fight through the Zilean ult even LUL
[2:11:25] Levyathin: That last second view dear god LUL
[2:11:27] sunflower204: feels good as adc when the frontline is making plays constantly :)
[2:11:28] ChurchOfKenny: Since Iron was put in, Bronze has gotten a lot better
[2:11:28] Boonia: that's a tilter
[2:11:42] RlDennis: Sylas has 49 cs ijpD
[2:11:46] Gank4CE1: KEKLEO
[2:11:46] Fiendmaw: Wait Iron is an actual league?
[2:11:50] Barba06: top 10 anime betrayals
[2:11:53] jingosaurus: @RlDennis what does gnar have
[2:11:55] Pewlitzer: you were the necessary human scarifice
[2:12:01] jingosaurus: @Fiendmaw Yes
[2:12:05] RlDennis: @jingosaurus I'd imagine around 100 - 120
[2:12:08] Skyform: Peeporidge farm remembers
[2:12:22] Gank4CE1: Iron iss new as of a couple years ago I think
[2:12:24] Levyathin: I'm seeing your mouse movement as an adc and its look might  good jp!
[2:12:37] ladderoat: they made iron because there were so many ppl in bronze, lots of ppl are really bad at this game lmao
[2:12:40] StarPogPlatinum: Iron league wasn't here the last time I've played
[2:12:50] flyscmusic: juicy xp
[2:12:54] RlDennis: Was added.. a few years ago?
[2:12:55] ChurchOfKenny: @StarPogPlatinum Added in the last 3 years or so
[2:13:15] DrewGamer: @ladderOAT as a bad, I can confirm there are a lot of us
[2:13:20] Barba06: no one saw that ult :)
[2:13:46] afreak10: LUL
[2:13:50] Levyathin: dw gnar is going ham KEKW
[2:13:52] RlDennis: @itmeJP Have you ever used Blue trinket as adc? It's a longer range ward that's visible and has 1 hp. But it allows you to check bushes
[2:14:02] AdrenALI_N: they popped off, and out... SnowRip
[2:14:07] RlDennis: Pretty decent to have as an adc
[2:14:10] StarPogPlatinum: @ChurchOfKenny Yeah I played from the beta to the release of Zoe
[2:14:15] Levyathin: Silas flashed
[2:14:24] revroom: the other team is feeding like there's no tomorrow is the reason your teammates seem to be doing good
[2:14:31] afreak10: 3vs1
[2:14:31] jingosaurus: F
[2:14:51] Levyathin: League 2022 KEKW
[2:15:39] Levyathin: bots pushing so na
[2:15:41] scooterjr37: get rift

[2:16:11] Kryllyk: bot goes mid after laning and stays there
[2:16:41] maaadmarty: Stuns if the second bomb also lands on them
[2:16:56] Fiendmaw: So you go mid as soon as the tower drops?
[2:17:10] Hopsinka: PJ is back ? PauseChamp
[2:17:31] Kryllyk: more like after landing Fiendmaw, which is questionable about when that is, but you can rotate top to take another tower or laning ends and you go mid
[2:17:33] RlDennis: @Fiendmaw pretty much, adc functions the best in teamfights so you kinda wanna be in the center (And mid is a shorter lane, thus safer)
[2:17:35] verentnarv: 2 cs pog
[2:17:39] revroom: later perhaps @Hopsinka
[2:17:57] Hopsinka: revroom pj mean if he is black and white ?

[2:58:04] Omakie: strap in boys another 50 minute throw fest that takes 10 years off jps life
[2:58:08] xDreadnord: 100% winnable for the enemy team
[2:58:09] Hyluhnduh: i believe
[2:58:13] Luthien_Cross: Kappa positivity!
[2:58:17] Gank4CE1: 50 minute loss NODDERS
[2:58:18] Netoen: Should tell them whether chat thinks it's winnable SeemsGood
[2:58:18] Hyluhnduh: I even voted for it
[2:58:19] jesterdetester85: if u actually are, u might win
[2:58:25] Darkaros: OOOO This'll be like that Garen game where JP actively loss sanity live but still won
[2:58:26] EvoCaliber: 30min and you win EZ Clap
[2:58:30] AdrenALI_N: @GrievAY it would make a lot more sense, same is true for a lot of games finameLUL
[2:58:37] sunflower204: I mean if twitch starts popping off you might have a chance
[2:58:40] Felgrun: @itmeJP With full boots it is faster to run to base than press B when you're on the inhib tower
[2:58:53] StarPogPlatinum: LOL
[2:59:04] warmaku: you can eat team mates, that so trolly
[2:59:05] Netoen: wimmable btw

[2:59:25] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:59:26] DagooX: NODDERS almost there
[2:59:30] Dbrn47: @AdrenALI_N More common... not really, but it depends
[2:59:31] Marc326: winnable, agreed COPIUM
[2:59:41] jesterdetester85: at this point people would vote no just to spite
[2:59:44] Felgrun: Honestly, play Yone
[2:59:46] DrYaguar: play Camille
[2:59:46] Frostberry: jp can you play a carry top lane ?
[2:59:51] Omakie: tahm wins lane but loses game and it sucks
[2:59:54] IToldYouItsTaken: aww, but you're pretty good with tahm
[2:59:56] Levyathin: I'm really recommending mordekaiser
[2:59:58] Omakie: thats how i feel about my favorite junglers
[2:59:59] a6314: the 1v9
[2:59:59] Fiendmaw: Back to Kayle NODDERS
[3:00:02] Baht: wouldn't it have been fine if you didn't have galio mid?
[3:00:10] sunflower204: keep twitch alive
[3:00:11] verentnarv: need more carry champions for top, your team had too many tanks for a low ELO match. @itmejp
[3:00:14] xmlgprorpx: time to learn jagula KEKW
[3:00:15] Point1985: Vayne top every game, they last for 2hours every time so you'd be able to carry every game :D
[3:00:17] Fiendmaw: Wasn't morgana mid?
[3:00:18] AdrenALI_N: @Dbrn47 cause higher level players would have a better understanding of what they could lose to, and play around it, but maybe that's more cards finameLUL
[3:00:22] Pewlitzer: tilt some ppl with Teemo KEKW

[3:00:49] Felgrun: LUL
[3:00:49] Samstein: idk if any other champ would make much difference in this game though, teammates just suck

[3:00:52] jeffhunter12: bikeLurk
[3:00:53] Darkaros: D:
[3:00:55] Gank4CE1: @itmeJP i was watching Fairlight play LoL this morning and he perma bans Mundo
[3:01:06] GrievAY: @itmejp your pick is fine and it is a carry, the issue is you got a Galio mid and only delivery of his ult is twitch sneaking in (aka useless).
[3:01:39] Omakie: i agree
[3:01:43] sckeperz: i honestly think the issue is nunu jungle. it does nothing but take objectives and he isn't even doing that
[3:01:43] jesterdetester85: @GrievAY if it's all to peel for twitch it's fine
[3:01:50] Omakie: these games cost you something deep inside you can never get back
[3:01:51] Riluske: but they said it was winnable! /s
[3:01:55] Point1985: And we don't have that many left JP
[3:01:57] sunflower204: twitch is your only hope :)
[3:01:58] geoffsgayestfan: -20 years from league Sadge
[3:01:58] afreak10: baron
[3:02:00] Puffywiggles: You can build Titanic Hydra and go Lethal on Tahm if you want to adapt him
[3:02:03] Netoen: LoL at least has a mechanic for surrender
[3:02:03] Felgrun: Those other people are all on duos probably and you're alone
[3:02:06] Haeher: Turning older in rapid speed rooOld
[3:02:08] jjoseneves: nunu is building full ap?
[3:02:10] Omakie: would rather get dumpstered and go 0/20 then get dragged around for 40 minutes
[3:02:19] GrievAY: @jesterdetester85 not rly, since if you want to peel for twitch there are better picks for mid
[3:02:21] sunflower204: why twitch :(
[3:02:22] Frostberry: BOOBA
[3:02:31] DagooX: nunu KEKW
[3:02:31] afreak10: nunu LUL
[3:02:32] Haeher: LUL
[3:02:34] Azzures_: oh boy that nunu
[3:02:41] Dbrn47: @AdrenALI_N it all depends on mistakes and morale.  All things staying equal, come backs aren't likely once the slide starts.  This current deficit would require throwing to start.
[3:02:42] Frostberry: hahahah

[3:05:07] Fiendmaw: Now Twitch is warning streamers?
[3:05:10] Felgrun: oh no adc kindred
[3:05:10] Puffywiggles: I don't think his playstyle is an afk farm to 16 style. Shens an active semi carry Tank with a global
[3:05:13] GrievAY: @itmejp have you tried Cho? Could fit your playstyle or perhaps Darius?
[3:05:14] afreak10: Kayle is so late game
[3:05:14] Marc326: @DagooX poki got banned for avatar, I heard, no?

[3:05:51] revroom: hasan moving again?
[3:05:55] Frostberry: what about gangplank or jayce are they still good carry top lane?
[3:06:01] DJunioD: hes probably just the first one to tweet it, maybe? @itmeJP
[3:06:03] IToldYouItsTaken: fox probably has a personal vendetta against him tbh
[3:06:07] DCHenkels: I think he is the only one who publicly announced he got one
[3:06:09] Muglore: @Vistoric Yes and hes pretyty strong right now
[3:06:11] snyft: People just stream shows openly on twitch? Or is it subwall so they assume its safe?
[3:06:12] afreak10: Gordon gave them the okay haha
[3:06:13] Marc326: @Darkaros look he doesn't make that much, he deserves a house COPIUM
[3:06:27] Miros__: don't think cho is really viable... very old kit
[3:06:32] Genostar0: Show him what we do to Teemo players JP!
[3:06:40] Sylarphile: @snyft in the open
[3:06:50] SamMFJackson: ijpPOGGERS god king ijpPOGGERS
[3:06:55] Darkaros: @snyft they openly stream it, sometimes with Twitch staff watching (they don't directly moderate the platform btw), but delete the VODs
[3:06:56] SamMFJackson: yes
[3:06:57] Genostar0: yes
[3:06:59] XIKaMuIX: yes
[3:06:59] IToldYouItsTaken: yep
[3:06:59] afreak10: ye
[3:06:59] Valyote: yup
[3:07:00] azuae: cho isn't viable as a tank.  as AP he could work with skill
[3:07:00] Kyuukotsu: Blind prevents Q. Yes.
[3:07:02] ketchuppotatochips: Yes, but you can E through his blind
[3:07:04] SamMFJackson: q will be blocked
[3:07:08] dudwasup: Definitely a lazy way to make “content”
[3:07:09] JimWho: That true @afreak10 ? Lol
[3:07:13] Netoen: 1 - 2 ?
[3:07:15] SamMFJackson: you need to bait his blind
[3:07:17] IToldYouItsTaken: nah
[3:07:18] GrievAY: Doesnt rly matter if the kit of Cho is old, look at Garen :)
[3:07:20] ketchuppotatochips: If you go fleet or phase rush you win after 6
[3:07:22] Achubra: run up and ignite him to assert dominance
[3:07:26] Point1985: E wait out the blind and Q
[3:07:28] Genostar0: he cant block your spin
[3:07:36] xmlgprorpx: he ruins melee
[3:07:37] Kyuukotsu: Bait out his Q first, then Q him.
[3:07:40] RitzC: just watch for the blind above your head, see how often he uses it
[3:07:40] IToldYouItsTaken: even if you can't queue him, you can still spin on that little weirdo
[3:07:41] pa_TIENce: E when you're blind I guess
[3:07:43] Point1985: Butit's a rough matchup for sure
[3:07:47] Point1985: lets pray he's a bad Teemo
[3:07:47] Rezzak77: he wins for a little bit but once you get items you can just spin on him
[3:07:50] Eplesh: what is the app your are using for all the start called?
[3:07:52] azuae: Biggest problem with Cho is all the mobility of the champs.  They need to speed up the cast animation of the Q and the world would change for Cho
[3:07:54] snyft: Do you lose less points if a teammate leaves btw in ranked?
[3:07:54] IToldYouItsTaken: don't know why i typed out queue
[3:07:57] ketchuppotatochips: Nidalee will prob help you because F Teemo's
[3:07:57] afreak10: @JimWho he tweeted calling Twitch out , but depends if its him or twitter team he got
[3:07:57] Gank4CE1: Fairlight was using exhaust for Garen v Teemo
[3:08:26] yanzz_: buy MR for first couple items and then teemo shouldnt be a problem
[3:08:30] Krazuel: maybe kindred will rule
[3:08:35] Rezzak77: first few levels are gonna suck if the teemo has half a brain
[3:08:38] JimWho: Oh, ok @afreak10 interesting ijpHMM
[3:08:40] BDave: bronze you never know other team may suck harder :D
[3:08:41] Fiendmaw: Garen doesnt win but he probably doesnt lose either
[3:08:53] Kyuukotsu: Ekko is AP.

[3:20:18] StarPogPlatinum: Teemo is on autopilot LUL
[3:20:18] Debazor: I feel like that's really all teemo does though. Just autos and lays the occasional shroom in the worst spot
[3:20:21] Dbrn47: He thought he was going to win

[3:21:13] Gank4CE1: 40 seconds to next death NODDERS
[3:21:21] MasqureMan: Are items in a decent place atm?
[3:21:27] Felgrun: With ulti you can just straight up kill him I think
[3:21:29] Debazor: Really like that Garen skin though, JP. Looks badass
[3:21:33] Ceratic: I would guess every time your ult is up you can just kill him
[3:21:41] Rezzak77: if you bait out blind then go if you got everything you should
[3:21:46] RichieGoose: You can trade and then back off and let your passive regen
[3:21:50] wdowny33: Teemo is less dangerous with mr for sure
[3:22:30] fyrepony9000: lucky ketchup teemo
[3:22:39] afreak10: top bushes prob

[3:23:02] Felgrun: I am officially impressed
[3:23:08] Eyeofthehawks: That adc end of game tirade about the leona woke me from my slumber yesterday, laughed pretty hard when you queued right back up again
[3:23:15] DJunioD: monkaS
[3:23:20] GrievAY: U win the lane from now on, stack MR and he can never kill you. The enemy team is 3.5 AP and 1.5 AD
[3:23:23] Felgrun: That ekko is gonna one shot everyone
[3:23:27] DJunioD: holy monkaS
[3:23:33] DJunioD: zed modCheck
[3:23:40] NotMyPersona: I love in this skin he randomly gets a second sword when spinning but its no where to be found anywhere else
[3:24:05] Drathas: that zed might be a bot
[3:24:09] Eyeofthehawks: You can shutdown ekko pretty hard, if it doesnt overflow to bot
[3:24:11] Felgrun: He's just spinning too fast
[3:24:23] Dbrn47: nah, he legit has another sword
[3:24:42] Simple_Hero: Here is what I dont understand about league. If I lose a game but have a A+ to S rating I think you should still gain a little lp or at least not lose Lp.
[3:24:50] Eyeofthehawks: Reset bounty Sadge
[3:24:54] Felgrun: Zed open bois
[3:25:05] Eyeofthehawks: @Simple_Hero the ratings are basically meaningless
[3:25:14] Debazor: Damn. Rell almost made it'
[3:25:19] Simple_Hero: @Eyeofthehawks then why have them
[3:25:22] DagooX: monkaS
[3:25:23] mrmosbka: NotLikeThis
[3:25:25] jjoseneves: @Simple_Hero imagine riot caring about the players
[3:25:31] Eyeofthehawks: @Simple_Hero theyre a gate for crates / keys
[3:25:32] Dbrn47: @Simple_Hero Make you feel good
[3:25:32] NotMyPersona: @Simple_Hero The problem with that it encourages kda players
[3:25:50] xmlgprorpx: his just so fed at this point he can just run underturret and kill some1
[3:25:55] viviblackmag: Sweeper
[3:26:04] Eyeofthehawks: Yeah a fed ekko who presses advantage just decides when you die
[3:26:09] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:26:13] Ewlu: feed ekko  is a nightmare
[3:26:21] Gank4CE1: call Liam Neeson we have a hostage taker
[3:26:48] br4nd0nh347: sweeper works for his shrooms right chat?
[3:26:48] SamMFJackson: teemo so fkin annoying
[3:26:50] Felgrun: They boutta go top and ruin your day
[3:26:52] fyrepony9000: zed says "we gonna win this"
[3:27:01] raynelkk: Ekko feels too strong
[3:27:02] SamMFJackson: hes an ez kill when ganked, not sure why the kindred isnt ganking
[3:27:14] Felgrun: @SamMFJackson Kindred is ADC
[3:27:23] xDreadnord: cmon

[3:27:44] Felgrun: Its bronze
[3:27:58] StarPogPlatinum: rank up
[3:28:01] Eyeofthehawks: Welcome to why i quit League
[3:28:02] Ebra: block them all?
[3:28:04] mrmosbka: it's question that ask almost every player
[3:28:05] DagooX: premade party? Hmm
[3:28:12] H4dus: can you blacklist people in LoL?
[3:28:14] bulletsponge55: I wish there was like an avoid button you click on other players names lol
[3:28:16] cenwenki: block them ?
[3:28:18] Felgrun: Because YOU have to be the one to the ekko things
[3:28:20] xmlgprorpx: welcome the reason i dont play ranked anymore
[3:28:24] Harakens: @DagooX can't solo/duo only queue
[3:28:32] GrievAY: You get up to master or higher
[3:28:33] Felgrun: Blocking them just makes them not be able to talk to you
[3:28:39] Eyeofthehawks: I jumped to TFT after 6 seasons of League, even in Plat this doesnt change
[3:28:42] DagooX: oh
[3:28:43] Frostberry: LUL zed
[3:28:45] Darkaros: Hmm i think we ain't got time for a W/L prediction boys
[3:28:45] KarmaTheQueen: I have a suggestion, if you wish to, buying oracle lens earler might be good to control teemos ulti spam
[3:28:54] kaleseyer: Hey, i know it sucks but everyone has bad games. Best thing you can do is just learn from it. Concentrate on your own mistakes and play. You can only control yourself
[3:29:03] mrmosbka: PJSalt TPFufun
[3:29:10] jjoseneves: i watch league streams to not forget how bad league makes me feel when i play it

[3:29:44] Felgrun: JP seems made for the ranked environment
[3:29:46] Darkaros: D: that's something you only say in Paradox games
[3:29:51] BbreakGaming: sounds like a good start to the season haha
[3:29:52] xDreadnord: hey,maybe theyre nice outside of the game :D
[3:29:54] Omakie: @itmeJP you should buy the top lane starter bundle there selling
[3:29:57] xmlgprorpx: BigBrother let it all out Clap
[3:29:58] MasqureMan: The best way to play League is go in knowing you can lose, and that’s okay
[3:29:58] TheTumbleingTusky: wow that game was sad
[3:30:02] Marc326: for better or for worse, stupid doesn't work like that
[3:30:06] Hyluhnduh: how did you get back to the menu so fast my game takes forever to get to home page
[3:30:07] Gank4CE1: bundles
[3:30:07] Omakie: its under champions then bundles
[3:30:07] Ellynas: Glad to know that LOL is still so full of PJSalt
[3:30:10] afreak10: bundles
[3:30:12] snyft: champions > bundles
[3:30:12] RlDennis: under bundles
[3:30:14] SeekoBlastar: champions > bundles
[3:30:20] Dbrn47: Imagine not being able to have babies because I'm bad at league... rooBooli
[3:30:22] Fiendmaw: I think you'd like Riven
[3:30:25] Eyeofthehawks: Wow thats a shit pack
[3:30:30] Felgrun: Teemo Irelia Riven LUL
[3:30:33] Sylohh: already got all except irelia
[3:30:34] Omakie: its cheaper then buying irelia alone
[3:30:36] RlDennis: If you want most top lane champions you can also just look at 'fighter' in the store
[3:30:40] GrievAY: Not worth it
[3:30:41] snyft: cheaper than buying irelia straight up
[3:30:43] OhTenGeneral: Riven in a starter pack? That's a choice
[3:30:47] Gank4CE1: owns Teemo bombadSus
[3:30:47] xmlgprorpx: deff not worth it
[3:30:49] Eyeofthehawks: You want someone who can engage, Malphite and Naut are super underrated low elo carries
[3:30:50] fdagent: those kind of comments make me anxious to even consider playing this game lol, love to watch it though
[3:30:51] Gat0rCh0mp: it subtracts the things you have from the price
[3:30:55] GrievAY: Irelia, and Riven are hard to play
[3:31:01] mrmosbka: how do you earn blue staff nowadays?
[3:31:08] Archangel3003: Get Irelia and 3 skins for less price
[3:31:09] Joebeezer: they got rid of the fighter pack?
[3:31:09] Felgrun: Irelia and Riven in a starter bundle, bruh
[3:31:11] DrewGamer: 2 of some of the most mechanically intensive champs in a "starter" pack WTF DansGame
[3:31:11] Joebeezer: shame
[3:31:11] mrmosbka: back in 2012 it was every battle
[3:31:13] Dbrn47: @fdagent It's not worth it imo
[3:31:25] Omakie: if you want irelia thats the cheapest way
[3:31:36] afreak10: she gets banned quite often tho
[3:31:37] azuae: Irelia or Akali
[3:31:39] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq

[3:32:01] Ewlu: you can try rengar top
[3:32:11] Jukettaja: Sometimes you can't analyse a game where the picks were bad
[3:32:11] sunflower204: that's how top lane is a lot of the time
[3:32:11] Felgrun: If you wanna be a real asshole just play quinn top
[3:32:11] H4dus: doesnt Irelia get banned most games
[3:32:16] Gank4CE1: maybe try JG?
[3:32:16] Eyeofthehawks: Part of playing top is trying your best to not be on that island, but yeah, sometimes it happens either way
[3:32:20] CadaverLuke: League has unwinnable games. its unescapable.
[3:32:20] TheTumbleingTusky: are you looking for a charter you can hard carry on?
[3:32:20] iUncouth: oh holy shit, Illaoi would be huge, bully the fuck outta everyone

[3:38:24] gotthejuicegg: Basically you just Q minions that are low to reset its CD, get to 5 stacks and auto people and toss in a stun, continue to auto till dead.
[3:38:27] xmlgprorpx: ult,q,e,q
[3:38:33] Omakie: yep
[3:38:33] Sir_RobsterRoll: last hit chain queen
[3:38:36] Eyeofthehawks: No, the marks dont stack
[3:38:36] Felgrun: Yes
[3:38:46] Joebeezer: marks dont stack
[3:38:49] Felgrun: The marks dont stack, but yea
[3:38:49] Sylohh: you want to autoatack between
[3:38:56] Omakie: r,q,e,q
[3:38:58] Baske_T: no, ult,  first q, then e then q
[3:39:04] Eyeofthehawks: I was like wtf is going on lmao
[3:39:12] Eyeofthehawks: Its more likely you lead with E
[3:39:17] Rezz284: usually yes
[3:39:23] Eyeofthehawks: E => Q in and go ham, R to stop all attacks and do it again
[3:39:24] Rezz284: but the slow from R can make it easier to hit E
[3:39:25] Felgrun: E,R,Q,E,Q,Q
[3:39:30] Radcosh: good night JP and chat. good luck with your ranked games
[3:39:41] Insigmada: nn Radcosh
[3:39:45] afreak10: reset ur mana
[3:39:47] Joebeezer: give yourself mana
[3:39:49] Darkaros: night Radcosh ijpHI
[3:40:07] SeekoBlastar: Can you E them to the front and back as well instead of side to side?
[3:40:09] Eyeofthehawks: Cooldowns refreshing again lol
[3:40:18] Eyeofthehawks: Try it with 3 dummies
[3:40:24] Omakie: your q can also be stacked via minions
[3:40:34] Omakie: or multiple dummies
[3:40:44] jingosaurus: you can cast it realllllly fast
[3:40:45] Hopsinka: irelia is really good at taking advantage of minions wave for chasing or escaping
[3:40:46] Achubra: build up passive then all in
[3:40:50] Eyeofthehawks: I mean youre level 18, but yeah your mana will disappear tho
[3:40:52] Omakie: yeah you can annilate minions
[3:40:58] Gank4CE1: buy items?
[3:41:00] xmlgprorpx: q kills stack passive = increase dmg
[3:41:01] Fiendmaw: No man refund
[3:41:07] jingosaurus: yes
[3:41:21] Eyeofthehawks: W is an awesome damage avoidance too
[3:41:25] Shunkan: You can cheese lvl up with quick wave clear
[3:41:32] ladderoat: You should turn on show mana costs in the options, dont know why its not on as standard tbh
[3:41:33] teeders: her autos are super strong basically autoing is most damage
[3:41:34] Felgrun: Mana doesnt get refunded on Q reset BTW
[3:41:50] Eyeofthehawks: Its a "dont die" button
[3:42:00] Achubra: its a defensive
[3:42:02] Eyeofthehawks: The damage is fairly negligible, its defensive
[3:42:03] Omakie: w allows you to tank something more or less
[3:42:03] qyang1212: you take less damage when charging W
[3:42:04] Cronopolis: And you can use W while CC'd too
[3:42:05] StarPogPlatinum: It's defensive
[3:42:05] Infidel_Art: Wanna charge it to survive burst
[3:42:06] Fiendmaw: Huge damage reduction while charging
[3:42:10] NotMyPersona: You also can do it fast to stack passive
[3:42:15] Felgrun: It is also pretty decent poke
[3:42:16] CadaverLuke: W reduces damage a lot
[3:42:17] ritchie313: it's helpful to watch a clip of her in a 1v1 helps understand her playstylr
[3:42:21] Felgrun: And builds passive
[3:42:26] Infidel_Art: YEP
[3:42:30] Omakie: w helps alot with matchups with things like set or tahm who wanna burst you
[3:42:32] Eyeofthehawks: 70% phys reduction and 35% magic is HUGE
[3:42:39] Eyeofthehawks: because its flat, pre-mitigation
[3:42:43] Tnobuhiko: you want to use it to tank burst
[3:42:49] Felgrun: Nah just once
[3:42:49] Eyeofthehawks: No, just animation
[3:42:50] teeders: could probably youtube irelia montage lol
[3:43:01] Eyeofthehawks: @itmeJP honestly champ spotlight is a good place to start

[3:48:59] AdrenALI_N: he did tweet it quite "proudly" as was suggested in chat
[3:49:02] Gank4CE1: more than one i think, it was master chef and fox
[3:49:24] AdrenALI_N: @daumis1 actually no, being willing to try new things is very much a master's mentality finameNom

[4:20:35] Razielvj: @bulletsponge55 Is not too much lower considering that the season lasts a year. the problem is that jp started playing at the end of last season

[4:24:12] allscorpion: @itmeJP have you tried renekton?
[4:24:13] Eyeofthehawks: Tryn can be so scary, or absolutely completely useless
[4:24:36] robertoredd: @Eyeofthehawks agreed
[4:24:38] i_revarm: trynd is  always scary imo, eventually he  just becomes a monster LUL
[4:24:44] yellgler: is ranked worse at the start of a season when all the sweatlords are grinding as with other competitive games?
[4:24:45] Ewlu: renekton cant hard carry

[4:25:29] Felgrun: Ranked is the absolutely worst at the beginning and end of season
[4:25:35] Dalek__Kahn: Ranked is bad 2 times a year. The first 6 months and the second 6 months.
[4:25:36] Bojack_The_Horseman: Pog league from arcane
[4:25:37] Brightbane: I watched arcane and started playing TFT instead
[4:25:37] Invess: amazonPumpkinWiggle Any Arcaners??? amazonPumpkinWiggle
[4:25:40] Lucien_NM: @illusionisttrixie that also work but i honestly save my ban for pure cancer champs
[4:25:41] kounounou: It is the same every year actually. I avoid ranked for a couple of weeks every year
[4:25:42] sckeperz: yeah everything that normally happens is being amplified by those 2 factors
[4:25:44] SeekoBlastar: Game is bad because new people are playing
[4:25:48] MADCERBERO: Sadge
[4:25:48] Eyeofthehawks: I feel like arcane brought a lot of people back in this Bronze to Plat range for sure
[4:25:51] Jinyael: ha jokes on them I instead decided to play TFT instead of hating myself playing actual LoL
[4:25:58] RockinBirbBoi: Start of season is usually a game stomps
[4:25:59] IllusionistTrixie: its less he's broken and more he breaks my mental :P
[4:26:08] Deadlyguz: but arcane is a banger of a tv show
[4:26:12] AnorienNightwish: oh, we learning new heroes?
[4:26:23] gotthejuicegg: thats really not that awful, most people that climb only have like 55% wr and this is only like day 1 of your ranked season anyway

[4:29:58] Joebeezer: maybe if you ask them nicely LUL
[4:30:04] Finvey: @eyeofthehawks the only intriguing thing about League was the fact that matches would only be 30-40 min. But with all the comeback mechanics I might as well ply ff14
[4:30:06] IndiePyromancer: the viewer player is jg right? any bets on if he camps the streamer?

[4:30:51] TheTumbleingTusky: last hit with q
[4:30:52] Achubra: that morde skin is the loudest thing ever made
[4:31:06] NotMyPersona: Mord just punishes melee champs
[4:31:07] jesterdetester85: huehueheuhue
[4:31:12] yanzz_: I miss pizza feet morde lol
[4:31:25] a_moonlighter: qss shuts his ult down at least

[4:32:06] Eyeofthehawks: The yasuo-ing begins
[4:32:08] Insigmada: the red pips under the hp/mana the passive stacks?
[4:32:13] Felgrun: Yasuo is certified dirt 1
[4:32:15] Deadlyguz: does JP know abot stacking the passive?
[4:32:16] Darkaros: PauseChamp now how's the t1 top tower matchup lookin

[4:32:49] ReginaldXIV: Ooh Irelia
[4:32:49] Big_Headed_Gamer: Hmm
[4:32:59] AnorienNightwish: now, was the intentional feed to rig the gamba? ijpHMM
[4:33:19] Drainora: the morde is so loud d:
[4:33:22] Finvey: @anoriennightwish conspiracy.
[4:33:22] Drainora: D:
[4:33:27] Rixxay: I had a friend say Morde has no bad match ups, is that true?
[4:33:37] NotMyPersona: They standardized irelia e and i cant hit it no more
[4:33:45] NotMyPersona: D:
[4:33:50] thatguyuknow985: Unsure if you know this, but you might want a qss for mord's ult. It'll let you get right out of it, basically nullifying it completely.
[4:33:50] br4nd0nh347: @rixxay it is
[4:33:52] NEMKI: If you E Q E its much easier to stun the target JP :)
[4:33:54] Luxtra_: i can see Irelia got a re-work from the last time i played this game cohhNotes
[4:34:01] Lucien_NM: @rixxay he gets fucked by pretty much every ranged top laner
[4:34:01] ReginaldXIV: The last time I played Irelia was before the rework
[4:34:01] NEMKI: Q on a minion about to die :)
[4:34:04] IllusionistTrixie: would be nice if amumu came to join this ultra pushed mord
[4:34:06] Shaimaal: if u use the first part of E in a bush, it is harder for the enemy to react
[4:34:22] reminkly: @NotMyPersona it's easier to hit if your initial E cast is at your feet and you use the 2nd cast to predict their movement
[4:34:23] Ebra: is that mord? they changed him so much
[4:34:27] Felgrun: irelia has been reworked for a few years yea
[4:34:27] Haeher: We playing Irelia haven’t seen JP play her before what she do rooIsee
[4:34:30] AnorienNightwish: i believe ijpNODDERS
[4:34:45] br4nd0nh347: @reminkly I think they reduced that last year
[4:34:50] Insigmada: wtf is this shit
[4:34:52] Felgrun: Brazil moment
[4:35:01] itz_just_camel: what th fuck was that
[4:35:03] iUncouth: bruh, let's hope your jungle gives some attention, cause Morde is perma pushed
[4:35:05] Lucien_NM: You buy QSS and you escape his ult.
[4:35:09] Ebra: man mord changed so much wtf
[4:35:09] Lucien_NM: easy
[4:35:10] NotMyPersona: @NotMyPersona That makes sense
[4:35:10] daniel85mg: lol wtf are those skills
[4:35:15] a_moonlighter: qss yeah
[4:35:21] IllusionistTrixie: mord's ult, lots of fun!
[4:35:24] slycefyre: @Insigmada morde ult, he basically traps someone in a spirit arena and 1v1s them until the time runs out of they are dead
[4:35:33] slycefyre: *or
[4:35:38] IllusionistTrixie: he says as amumu heads to bot lane, again
[4:35:41] Daruvik: Jungle will come top eventually COPIUM
[4:35:42] reminkly: @br4nd0nh347 it's still far easier to use the 2nd part of the cast to predict movement rather than cast it far out. a first cast far out shows your 'max range' while at your feet you can go anywhere out to max 360 from your spot
[4:35:46] thatguyuknow985: They even have an upgrade for qss which is good for ad champs
[4:36:01] NotMyPersona: I wonder if jp is going the non mythic first item route this game
[4:36:05] Felgrun: Mercurial scimitar aint that great
[4:36:06] Insigmada: looked like some tron shit to me

[4:36:43] IllusionistTrixie: about 100s, it'll be back up now
[4:36:43] TheTumbleingTusky: LONG
[4:36:44] iUncouth: I dont remember
[4:36:46] Big_Headed_Gamer: just keep practicing landing those E's on him
[4:36:47] Gank4CE1: shruggers
[4:36:47] Megarioran: big
[4:36:50] Haeher: Oh wow putting down those totems or whatever for that skill seems like a pretty player skill based ability rooIsee
[4:36:52] kounounou: I know it is expensive but just a thought, qss cancels his ult.
[4:36:55] Felgrun: Not quite 2 mins
[4:36:57] Big_Headed_Gamer: you waste an E he is going to go in
[4:36:58] metz0mat: 140 120 100 seconds
[4:36:59] Chopstix2005: welp mid is feeding
[4:37:02] Lucien_NM: @chopstix2005 7 mins in, amumu isnt supposed to perma gank
[4:37:14] yanzz_: surprised amumu isnt ganking more now theyre 6
[4:37:16] a_moonlighter: that's 3 deaths on Yasuo right?
[4:37:25] crawds: bonk
[4:37:25] itz_just_camel: we almost did it
[4:37:26] NEMKI: Not much you can do right now
[4:37:40] RitzC: QSS cancels his ult
[4:37:43] reminkly: @itmeJP qss can break out of the ult, but that's not amazing as a first item obviouslyt
[4:37:46] honeystout: not a bad attempt tbh
[4:37:47] IndiePyromancer: unfortunately it looks like amumu is trying to help the yasuo
[4:37:50] Lucien_NM: Buy Quicksilversash
[4:37:53] IToldYouItsTaken: you'll learn with time, it's your first time on irelia and she can be tricky
[4:37:56] Haeher: LUL
[4:37:57] Brightbane: Now he's 7! There's hope
[4:38:01] Rixxay: Prob a farm lane till late game lol
[4:38:02] IllusionistTrixie: yeah QSS tax at this point
[4:38:04] Ebra: not gonna lie, mord looks so much cooler now
[4:38:11] thatguyuknow985: qss cancels mmord's ult
[4:38:19] Lucien_NM: QSS or you will continue dying against him
[4:38:21] StarPogPlatinum: You just need practice on your new champ, you don't really know what you can do or not here
[4:38:24] IllusionistTrixie: thats mord's legendary skin, its quite new
[4:38:34] Big_Headed_Gamer: yeah this amumu big succ
[4:38:38] iUncouth: morde ult is 140 seconds at lvl 1
[4:38:44] sckeperz: its not legendary its just project
[4:38:50] Shaimaal: you want to level up W after Q
[4:39:06] Shaimaal: also W is a Channel
[4:39:06] Lucien_NM: @sckeperz its a Legendary Project Skin
[4:39:07] Sparky95_: @sckeperz It's both x
[4:39:18] IllusionistTrixie: its 1800 RP and very pretty
[4:39:19] Sparky95_: I snagged it from a box
[4:39:20] Baske_T: chat, how long do you have to place the second E after the first?
[4:39:24] Sparky95_: never played morde in my life
[4:39:24] bijoushin: you should still win after 2 items
[4:39:29] sckeperz: it may be marked legendary but its defintely not up to the quality of others
[4:39:32] ReginaldXIV: rift herald
[4:39:34] IllusionistTrixie: E auto casts at your feet after 2s
[4:39:48] Haeher: Yeah you need to get a real good kill with the help of your jungler to catch up rooIsee
[4:39:52] Sparky95_: @sckeperz It's been very well received I thought, it's a nice skin imo
[4:39:54] Baske_T: @IllusionistTrixie thx
[4:40:22] Felgrun: @sckeperz I think its better than all the other project skins
[4:40:24] NotMyPersona: I saved my amazon prime rp and bought True damage Ekko that skin is clean chat
[4:40:38] Daruvik: ijpNODDERS
[4:40:38] crawds: morde magic dmg
[4:40:41] Megarioran: wrong boots
[4:40:43] SinisterShinigami: i feel like jp would like playing mord
[4:40:50] sckeperz: im not saying its bad. I just think other legendaries got more love
[4:40:53] Felgrun: Finding Top Lane
[4:41:04] IllusionistTrixie: oh yeah plated not good v mord
[4:41:04] Sparky95_: @sckeperz Which ones out out interest, genuinely curious x
[4:41:10] Ebra: mord probably can fight the whole team now solo
[4:41:13] Lucien_NM: honestly you have to think of the perspective of the jungler, would you wsnt to gank when one of you two is definitely going to die to his ult?
[4:41:16] Haeher: Damn that Mort arena is really deadly once he gets even slightly stronger then you it’s just a complete trap
[4:41:26] MasqureMan: Finding Amumu
[4:41:31] sond23: You should never gank a Morde that's ahead
[4:41:36] IllusionistTrixie: he also steals 10% of your stats, so you cannot fight him in there, really
[4:41:42] sckeperz: the god king set @Sparky95_
[4:41:43] Fateborn: It is all that one viewers fault. Has to be.
[4:41:51] DagooX: modCheck
[4:41:56] Lucien_NM: too bad he doesnt see the QSS messages
[4:41:57] sunflower204: Jungle tend to focus on the winning lane to snowball the advantage rather than ganking losing lane.
[4:42:01] ag_blues: This is why Amumu has no friends.
[4:42:03] Sparky95_: @sckeperz Yewaah I agree here, I got Dariu's and Garen's set with the border, I'm a supp main xD
[4:42:08] Sparky95_: soo good though
[4:42:18] Big_Headed_Gamer: it isn't just on amumu. yasuo could rotate...
[4:42:20] Wulfenst: @itmeJP shes tricky. Ive got thousands of hrs into league and cannot play her for shit, but getting her passive stacked is super important. Good luck learning her though she seems fun :D
[4:42:24] sckeperz: exactly. Like I said the skin is fine. I just don't think it is worth the legendary RP cost
[4:42:31] Daruvik: modCheck gamba payout mods? modCheck
[4:42:31] Ebra: mumu ded
[4:42:32] Khuja__: what jungler doesn't gankl a laner that pushed...
[4:42:34] Big_Headed_Gamer: yasuo has only left lane for dragon so far
[4:42:36] Haeher: @illusionisttrixie oh my even steals 10% stats that seems hard to deal with
[4:42:40] sckeperz: but i also don't play morde so I may be bias
[4:42:41] Sparky95_: @sckeperz True damage Ekko? What's your take on that?
[4:42:48] Lucien_NM: @sckeperz same, i think Dark Star is the best Morde
[4:42:54] IllusionistTrixie: mord is my second main, and yeah if he gets a lead in lane he's going to smash you
[4:42:55] Sparky95_: I feel some of the academia legendaries aren't too goo either
[4:42:56] NEMKI: CC15 LUL
[4:42:58] Daruvik: ty
[4:43:15] Bojack_The_Horseman: hasagi
[4:43:17] sunflower204: that's why he don't gank, morede can 1v2 you guys :)
[4:43:17] Kyrvix: The problem with ganking a Morde is that he can just make it a 1v1 when he has ult. He's difficult to deal with.
[4:43:20] Felgrun: Oh damn yasuo actually killed him
[4:43:24] IllusionistTrixie: his "weakness" is team fights and Yasuo.Yone/Yi
[4:43:32] Darkaros: modCheck Any believers? Will JP WIN?
[4:43:43] sckeperz: @Sparky95_ its definitely a good skin again don't play him so don't know it that well.
[4:43:58] Baske_T: @Darkaros I'lll play the odds!
[4:44:05] Haeher: I will believe rooBless
[4:44:11] Baske_T: big payout if it works
[4:44:12] Big_Headed_Gamer: if team actually helps JP and he gets late game he will feel the power of late game irelia
[4:44:13] Omakie: those are some insane odds
[4:44:13] Sparky95_: @sckeperz Who'd you main? my top 4 are Lux, Leona, Morgana and Brand :D
[4:44:14] Felgrun: COPIUM
[4:44:14] IndiePyromancer: I think your bot lane is ahead so maybe there's a chance?

[4:45:02] daniel85mg: Elo hell
[4:45:05] sckeperz: @Sparky95_ When i played rank it was Alistar,Thresh, Zyra, Nami
[4:45:07] Big_Headed_Gamer: naut losing to a panth :(
[4:45:11] Ebra: OOOO
[4:45:13] Bojack_The_Horseman: lets go
[4:45:26] NotMyPersona: We getting kills chat we might still be in this

[4:45:49] Sparky95_: I grabbed the spirit blossom skin for Thresh tho!
[4:45:50] Daruvik: This lane is no more, it has ceased to be!
[4:45:52] i_revarm: how arrewe likingthe irelia gameplay?=
[4:46:03] Lucien_NM: first item botrk when hes not ahead scrubnoobPepega
[4:46:15] sckeperz: @Sparky95_ I played with a duo alot for awhile and did ashe/zyra bot lvl 6 was a kill everytime. We timed it to back just before we dinged and ding in lane
[4:46:19] Haeher: That mort is so feed now oh no rooKek
[4:46:20] sunflower204: they can't really do anything about morde though, his ult turns any ganks into 1v1
[4:46:22] Insigmada: It's his first time playing it
[4:46:24] IllusionistTrixie: oh interesting, shieldbow as irelia's mythic, I didn't think that was meta
[4:46:34] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Lucien_NM he still needs to learn item purposes don't be an asshole :)
[4:46:41] Sparky95_: @sckeperz Oooh that's nasty, I used to play Leo MF with my BF, the ult combo there is also great!
[4:46:46] daniel85mg: LUL
[4:46:53] Dalek__Kahn: Distraction deployed
[4:46:58] Garandro: chrisS
[4:47:01] Sir_RobsterRoll: amumu looks fabulous
[4:47:09] daniel85mg: Is amumu a troll viewer?
[4:47:10] Felgrun: Yasuo just really wanted that katarina dead
[4:47:12] Haeher: He is gonna LUL
[4:47:13] IndiePyromancer: that's embarrassing for their team tbh LUL
[4:47:18] scooterjr37: I dont know why people never use the turret
[4:47:29] Sir_RobsterRoll: oof morde hurts
[4:47:29] afreak10: yikes
[4:47:30] Insigmada: what it takes them out of the game that insane
[4:47:37] Lucien_NM: @big_headed_gamer thats true, im really sorry, didnt know hes new to this game.
[4:47:38] Big_Headed_Gamer: um
[4:47:41] AnorienNightwish: ijpWTF is that ult
[4:47:51] Haeher: Yup he got that full lane money all the towers
[4:47:59] Ebra: damn that mord is not good, otherwise he couldve done 1v5
[4:48:00] Haeher: there is nothing to be done
[4:48:04] Daruvik: I think we found the tanky carry champion JP needs to learn to carry when he gets awful team-mates
[4:48:14] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Lucien_NM it's ok you're just a typical. it shows :)
[4:48:14] i_revarm: i hope  you like irelia and stick with  her, she is very  versatile in build path and playstyle, youjust gotta  get to a point where you  can take  advantage  of  it  ofc
[4:48:17] Nightshaft25: i am out
[4:48:26] Haeher: LUL
[4:48:26] i_revarm: and that comes with time
[4:48:29] Sparky95_: Despite his none of ganks did he at least get Objs?
[4:48:34] Sonatta: inconceivable!
[4:48:34] NEMKI: Can you not 1 shot the range creeps with Q anymore?
[4:48:38] ZcottD: theres an opposite area to bottom1? heresy!
[4:48:38] Sparky95_: I am unsure
[4:48:41] IndiePyromancer: ddHuh I have to watch the lanes?
[4:49:03] DrYaguar: lets go Yasuo
[4:49:13] Big_Headed_Gamer: amu watches tyler 1
[4:49:16] Big_Headed_Gamer: without a doubt
[4:49:18] i_revarm: nice
[4:49:19] Lucien_NM: @big_headed_gamer heh i did an apology and you keep judging me, it really shows what kind of human you are.
[4:49:20] NotMyPersona: Yasuo snowballing RyuChamp RyuChamp
[4:49:22] Nightshaft25: LUL
[4:49:23] Sparky95_: real question here, I don't play it. Is it the Jungler's job to win lane for you? or is it to help win the lane then leave toy?
[4:49:29] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Lucien_NM SeemsGood
[4:49:31] i_revarm: she died thats all that  matters
[4:49:33] Sparky95_: and should they gank losing lanes?
[4:49:37] Sparky95_: or focus on snowballing others?
[4:49:39] NEMKI: @Sparky95_ Always blame jungle ;)
[4:49:40] Insigmada: "The Amumu Returns?" should of been in the poll LUL
[4:49:41] Kyrvix: Slowed her down enough so the team could catch up
[4:49:41] Archangel3003: The support got the kill and that's all that matters KEKW
[4:49:50] Sparky95_: I am being deadly honest what is the answer?
[4:49:52] Fateborn: There is a small chance you can still win. Maybe 5% but I like those odds!
[4:49:54] Bojack_The_Horseman: tyler1E
[4:49:54] IllusionistTrixie: rip support
[4:50:03] Dbrn47: jungle usually helps gank to keep them under control
[4:50:04] Nightshaft25: Support got kil job done
[4:50:05] noble_arya: nice
[4:50:05] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Bojack_The_Horseman atpCap
[4:50:07] afreak10: Pog
[4:50:10] Darkaros: PauseChamp good MF ult
[4:50:14] MammothEU: cohhPog
[4:50:20] NotMyPersona: Bye base
[4:50:21] afreak10: Mord winning
[4:50:26] Felgrun: @Sparky95_ It depends on the jungler, usually they just help a lane get an advantage, then push that advantage harder
[4:50:28] Sparky95_: @Dbrn47 So like to mitigate losing lanes?
[4:50:28] Shaimaal: @Sparky95_ thats a loaded question, it depends a lot on the lane, and the champion match  ups
[4:50:29] i_revarm: @Sparky95_ it all depends in the champions, some are  fine losing slowly, others need  to get  dug  out etc.
[4:50:42] Sparky95_: Ahh thank you for the insight chat! x <3
[4:50:44] sond23: @Sparky95_ Jungle role is to provide support for their winning condition, sometimes it's objectives, sometimes it's the Jungl himself, more often it's drakes and bot/mid
[4:50:44] sunflower204: typically jungle shouldn't gank the lane that's too far behind, better and safer to help the winning lane win more
[4:50:46] Big_Headed_Gamer: crazy how they are just letting morde end
[4:50:48] Sparky95_: All of you, much appreciated!
[4:50:56] Lucien_NM: @sparky95_ junglers main purpose is to secure objectives and help the lanes out.
[4:51:03] Pickedaname_: It's all subjective, based on matchups & team comps. You pressure the map
[4:51:05] NotMyPersona: That jinx ult
[4:51:06] i_revarm: some  champs  get  hard fucked if they fall behind so ganking  them even if your top dies and fall  further behind can be fine
[4:51:09] Felgrun: Holy shit no one died Pog
[4:51:09] DrYaguar: winnable
[4:51:10] Nightshaft25: 5vs1 lol
[4:51:37] Sparky95_: I never thought how much matchups and the jungler would influence that :) x
[4:51:37] Big_Headed_Gamer: they just trying to have a reason to flame you after game
[4:51:39] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:51:41] rHakkar: Soo Irelia ult is a skill shot?! Can it be blocked by yasuos wind wall?
[4:51:45] i_revarm: the build  u.gg is  giving you issuper aggro, i love it
[4:51:51] i_revarm: thats  the build i do on her aswell
[4:52:00] Shaimaal: @rHakkar yes
[4:52:02] afreak10: YAPPP
[4:52:05] Kyrvix: @rHakkar It's a projectile so yeah
[4:52:14] afreak10: she talks so much
[4:52:18] rHakkar: Niiice, thanks guys
[4:52:22] Felgrun: @Sparky95_ Yeah the game has like 158 characters, which one you choose changes how you play the game pretty drastically
[4:52:23] Big_Headed_Gamer: i would use super minions to help you level
[4:52:28] Big_Headed_Gamer: don't leave top
[4:52:32] Big_Headed_Gamer: till inhib is back
[4:52:51] NotMyPersona: oh no mord using his brain
[4:52:56] Sparky95_: @Felgrun well, yeah I play also, just nit playing that role made it not as obvious :) I only peaked Gold :/
[4:53:12] Sparky95_: I enjoy the insight into a role I haven't played!
[4:53:30] azuae: Mord can be a carry at this ELO
[4:53:49] SlipCrit: KEKW
[4:53:50] Bojack_The_Horseman: KEKW
[4:53:54] Daruvik: makes me think JP should give learning Mord a try, seems like with practice he's a major power-house
[4:53:56] DrYaguar: KEKW
[4:54:00] itz_just_camel: JP i love your stream have a good night man!
[4:54:01] Bojack_The_Horseman: no way duder KEKW
[4:54:02] Nightshaft25: KEKW
[4:54:03] Rixxay: Just permaban mord lol ggez
[4:54:04] Balthyxar: I wish i was in bronze right now, because i just had a jungler that didnt know how to jungle and chose lee sin, probably one of the hardest junglers to play let alone learn and did horribly with him
[4:54:08] Luke90toko: KEKW
[4:54:22] Lucien_NM: @rixxay why does he ban Jhin in the first place, is there a reason
[4:54:24] i_revarm: want  your mind blown again, having no mr or  bonus health vs him kinda invites alot of  dmg Kappa
[4:54:25] JuK3s: hotel JP today
[4:54:26] Deadlyguz: people really need to learn to just top typing if you don't have anything good to say
[4:54:28] Felgrun: @itmeJP Morde game next? Kappa
[4:54:37] Big_Headed_Gamer: everything is a carry at this Elo chat KEKW shut the hell up KEKLEO
[4:54:45] Shaimaal: jp wits end would be really good item to go here
[4:54:53] NotMyPersona: @Lucien_NM Teams don't know how to play against him and feed him
[4:54:57] Altair900: Deadlyguz expecting that level of intelligence is a bit much KEKW
[4:54:59] Bojack_The_Horseman: amumu can be a carry at this elo Kapp
[4:55:03] ChaosKunai: @Deadlyguz It'll never happen. People love to comment when it isn't warranted.
[4:55:07] Nightshaft25: @felgrun good suggestion monkaS
[4:55:13] Invess: welp
[4:55:53] Rixxay: Still winnable, lower Eli tends to throw leads a lot
[4:55:59] Rixxay: Elo *
[4:55:59] IllusionistTrixie: winnable?
[4:56:01] afreak10: jinx
[4:56:02] Baske_T: jinx rocket i think
[4:56:05] Felgrun: Jinx Ulti
[4:56:07] sunflower204: jinx rocket
[4:56:16] Nightshaft25: winnable
[4:56:16] Pickedaname_: Are they 1v1ing in 'the shadow realm'?
[4:56:20] Lucien_NM: This Rocket travels across the map.
[4:56:40] Felgrun: @IdkiPickedaName Yes, Morde sends you to brazil and 1v1s you
[4:56:48] KAHVITEK: MmmHmm these tunes so chill
[4:56:49] Shaimaal: when you hit your E, you should Q first before you Ult them, otherwise you waste 1 mark @itmeJP
[4:56:49] Pickedaname_: hue
[4:56:51] AnorienNightwish: like mord ult seems just so stupid.. actually REMOVING someone from the battle to a different realm is just big ijpWTF to me
[4:56:52] Balthyxar: your E has a decent duration when placing it once, so if you need to engage for you team you drop the E first, then dive and place the second for the stun/s
[4:56:56] KarmaTheQueen: @itmeJP Morde id AP dmg, build some mr
[4:57:12] afreak10: Mord just walk and slams
[4:57:12] IllusionistTrixie: lol their kat is 13 :P
[4:57:27] Haeher: @anoriennightwish same and somebody else said he even steals 10% of you stats seems kinda cracked LUL
[4:57:33] i_revarm: i thought jp was pretty  clearon not wanting  'advice' on how  to play but good  job chat KEKW
[4:57:40] Felgrun: At least kat seems to be behind, but then there's morde lvl 17 LUL
[4:57:41] rHakkar: Thats winnable
[4:57:45] afreak10: Pog
[4:57:49] KAHVITEK: Raid boss down Pog
[4:57:50] Felgrun: RAID BOSS DOWN
[4:57:50] IToldYouItsTaken: LETS GO
[4:57:50] sunflower204: morde got cocky
[4:57:52] itz_just_camel: dont call it a comeback
[4:57:54] DrYaguar: Pog
[4:57:54] Riluske: nice
[4:58:00] IllusionistTrixie: Yasuo hit his 10 death power spike
[4:58:00] Bojack_The_Horseman: winnable
[4:58:09] OdinX1: Yasuwoaaah
[4:58:13] NotMyPersona: Yasuo online RyuChamp
[4:58:13] afreak10: 3 alive
[4:58:30] Big_Headed_Gamer: @i_revarm he could def use it problem is half the baboons in the chat either don't play or suck. PepePoint also backseating allowed is on in the channel tags
[4:58:46] chipira: mord losing steam?
[4:59:04] OdinX1: didnt see his build
[4:59:08] OdinX1: He maybe picked shit items
[4:59:11] IllusionistTrixie: yup, mord doesn't scale as well as Yasuo.Irelia
[4:59:35] IToldYouItsTaken: WHOOP HIS ASS
[4:59:35] IllusionistTrixie: also that
[4:59:37] Big_Headed_Gamer: welcome to late game irelia
[4:59:37] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[4:59:47] Felgrun: FUCK HIS ASS
[4:59:52] MasqureMan: Amumu actually initiating PrideRise
[4:59:55] Haeher: We having a comeback right here rooPog
[4:59:55] WantedOne: @i_revarm part of the issue though, is half the advise is "win lane" or "get good" which isn't helpful.
[4:59:58] afreak10: ur not pushing tho
[5:00:00] zenoots: 33% more kills on your team
[5:00:01] Nightshaft25: WINNABLE
[5:00:02] DrYaguar: winnable
[5:00:03] afreak10: ur team*
[5:00:06] Riluske: winnable
[5:00:10] i_revarm: @Big_Headed_Gamer just having  garbage 'advice' thrown at you while  focusing on other things  generally doesnt  do shit for  you  now  does it
[5:00:11] Omakie: id get quicksilver sash into merc scimitar from here
[5:00:11] AnorienNightwish: @i_revarm well, there is a difference how you present your advice.. which is lost on some people
[5:00:14] Nightshaft25: have faith
[5:00:17] Lucien_NM: Yasuo hit Powerspike
[5:00:19] Dalek__Kahn: Just gotta try and herd the team to objectives
[5:00:20] RitzC: need to be getting toweres quick here
[5:00:23] Megarioran: @itmeJP now you all get huge advantages
[5:00:28] TETLegion: more kills yes but look tower..
[5:00:33] Big_Headed_Gamer: @i_revarm didn't I just say that 4Head atpCap
[5:00:35] Sparky95_: @Omakie Is this because QSS cleanses Morde ult?
[5:00:36] Riluske: This is very satisfying to watch right now
[5:00:38] Felgrun: Melt them turrets
[5:00:38] i_revarm: just let him play lol, heäll figure it  out LUL
[5:00:41] Sparky95_: Does it?
[5:00:41] IndiePyromancer: so morde had a 3 tower lead and yasuo died like 5 times in 5 minutes, but we're still here BoneZone
[5:01:01] Haeher: Solo push PogChamp get that top lane
[5:01:08] Felgrun: I feel like you can kill this panth
[5:01:09] Omakie: @Sparky95_ also because it gives mr and ad
[5:01:19] DrYaguar: Pog
[5:01:20] zenoots: double kill naut Pog
[5:01:21] NotMyPersona: Good ol you dont lose the game til your nexus explodes
[5:01:24] afreak10: team popping off
[5:01:31] Sparky95_: Yeaaa, as opposed to silvermere which is health I think
[5:01:35] Edot_KH: are inhibitors what actually allows the minions to spawn?
[5:01:42] Kryllyk: push out bot instead
[5:01:49] F4ll3N6666: wp jp
[5:01:50] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Edot_KH super ones
[5:01:52] i_revarm: you're  still 220 last  hits   and  have  a   good amount of xp
[5:01:57] slycefyre: @Edot_KH super minions spawn if you take down inhibs
[5:01:57] sunflower204: turns out top actually doesn't exist Kappa
[5:01:58] IllusionistTrixie: that was an interesting int from kat there
[5:02:05] Felgrun: Yasuo got the 0/10 powerspike, its fine
[5:02:07] DrYaguar: back
[5:02:17] Haeher: It’s crazy to me that this comeback was possible rooIsee but nice
[5:02:18] i_revarm: also only  dying  4 times  is big
[5:02:21] afreak10: back
[5:02:22] Edot_KH: i am now more confused, lol
[5:02:31] ChiZWorkshop: ChiZWorkshop subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months!

[5:02:47] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Edot_KH must be a birth defect Kappa
[5:02:50] NotMyPersona: I miss triforce irelia it felt good to q all minions in wave
[5:02:53] sunflower204: "top lane doesn't matter, ganking top never wins" Kappa
[5:02:56] ProxyClouds: JPs team could use some more wards
[5:02:57] slycefyre: @Edot_KH minions always spawn no matter what, if you take down an inhib, you spawn super minions which as you would imagine are way stronger than regular minions, giving you an advantage
[5:03:06] Kryllyk: Side lane push with middle pushing with minions
[5:03:09] LaowaiUK: Don’t think I’ve ever seen JP play league
[5:03:14] LaowaiUK: What’s his peak?
[5:03:17] DrewGamer: @NotMyPersona do people not build that anymore?
[5:03:18] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Edot_KH if the team takes down an inhib 1 minion per wave is now a super minion. stops when inhib respawns.
[5:03:31] Megarioran: E Q E
[5:03:32] Edot_KH: @Big_Headed_Gamer i don't play the game and try to deduce what things do, i'll go back to not worrying about it
[5:03:33] Deadlyguz: don't lead with it all the time
[5:03:35] Joebeezer: watch some irelia vids?
[5:03:46] NotMyPersona: @NotMyPersona Depends but not always
[5:03:50] i_revarm: you can go tri force, goredrinker, shieldbow or  divine sunderer on her LUL
[5:03:54] i_revarm: she has alot of options
[5:03:56] Balthyxar: you can Q dash and place the E a second time too
[5:04:01] afreak10: weird ult
[5:04:04] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Edot_KH if you don't play or plan to play best not to worry. games complex to newbies.
[5:04:07] Felgrun: @LaowaiUK He has been playing for a few months now, I think his last rank was like silver 2

[5:06:07] Sonatta: SUKI
[5:06:17] IndiePyromancer: that morde must be real upset LUL
[5:06:18] Ebra: ehhh
[5:06:23] Shawmaleleon: gg JP am the naut
[5:06:24] pandalisk9: i also feel like morde was throwing by ulting naut so much in fights, he should be assassinating carries with his forced 1v1 while ahead
[5:06:25] br4nd0nh347: both
[5:06:25] ZcottD: i didnt care for true blood
[5:06:25] afreak10: a bit of both
[5:06:25] IllusionistTrixie: both?
[5:06:26] zucroh: first few seasons were ok imo

[5:06:31] bulletsponge55: good in the beginning then shit lol
[5:06:31] Sonatta: it was OK at best, the books were better
[5:06:32] village_of_idiots: first season decent then downhill hard
[5:06:32] IthnanCryo: I found it boring
[5:06:34] Omakie: @itmeJP next time you face a mordekaiser buy a quicksilver sash so you can cleanse his ult and run away
[5:06:34] Pewlitzer: why not both?
[5:06:34] StarPogPlatinum: First seasons were okay
[5:06:35] Fateborn: Both? (didn't watch)
[5:06:36] Sparky95_: Morde is done for the day KEKW
[5:06:39] Darkaros: no idea
[5:06:40] WantedOne: only thing i remember from it was tuning into it, and seeing orgies. every time

[5:06:42] littlebobbytables: it's just so hard to find porn these days

[5:06:47] Luke90toko: The real loss is the Mords...
[5:06:51] Ebra: something about ancients?

[5:07:03] Bojack_The_Horseman: some shit has come to light
[5:07:03] afreak10: a lot of backstabbing
[5:07:04] snyft: they sucked each other off
[5:07:04] Poobzee: lotta weird shit
[5:07:07] Darkaros: i think i've legit seen porn with better/ more memorable plot than true blood
[5:07:09] Big_Headed_Gamer: i just started You
[5:07:10] Invess: That dialogue can apply to what we do in the shadows
[5:07:10] thrillhouse451: Everyone cam
[5:07:12] Poobzee: A LOT  of weird shit
[5:07:14] Big_Headed_Gamer: and am addicted
[5:07:16] mandehl: was good until they got away from the books
[5:07:26] Edot_KH: win is a win...2-4 now
[5:07:26] Pickedaname_: Vampires were draining humans and drugging them to get high off blood iirc
[5:07:32] sunflower204: the quintessential top experience: winning lane but still lose/losing lane but still win.
[5:07:32] JellyCubed: Would you go vampire if offered the option?
[5:07:37] Sonatta: i still binge through Spartacus twice a year NODDERS
[5:07:40] zucroh: @itmeJP have you tried out morde yet ?
[5:07:51] br4nd0nh347: there was a disease or something right?
[5:08:03] Big_Headed_Gamer: play braum top Kappa
[5:08:09] TheTumbleingTusky: he kept getting picked off dont feel bad for him
[5:08:09] Joebeezer: have you thought about jungling jp?
[5:08:16] Insigmada: Look at it this way jp, the amount of times that was you with tahm cohhFeels
[5:08:17] Mase88mase88: it had good actors that carried a mediocre plot
[5:08:20] TheTumbleingTusky: he wa high on his power
[5:08:24] Felgrun: @itmeJP Its 2-4 now
[5:08:24] Omakie: i dont wanna live forever screw that
[5:08:25] Sonatta: what kind of vampire... there so much vampire fiction
[5:08:29] sunflower204: that morde was pretty shit at team fight to be fair.
[5:08:31] NotMyPersona: once your love ones die it wouldnt be fun no more
[5:08:33] Darkblue08: After 200 years it gets old
[5:08:36] Invess: Also you wouldn't be able to go out during the day
[5:08:37] Daruvik: @itmeJP update your game W/L on your camera panel SeemsGood
[5:08:48] Invess: or eat normal food in some cases
[5:08:51] afreak10: just be a vamp gamer :P
[5:08:51] Tury4l: i guess it depends on your goals in life
[5:08:52] StarPogPlatinum: Eternal life is a trap
[5:08:53] hkharp: At that point you kinda live for other people.
[5:08:54] WantedOne: "your live is buy an instant!"
[5:08:56] DagooX: you could play LoL forever Kappa
[5:08:57] blackmonk1: but you will play games all the time
[5:08:59] br4nd0nh347: @invess in some shows vamps could
[5:09:01] Sonatta: like if you were talking being a Kindred from Vampire the Masquare, fuck that, those guys are miserable
[5:09:01] StarPogPlatinum: Imagine you're the only one alive at one point
[5:09:05] JellyCubed: That's a 100% fair point of view.
[5:09:08] slycefyre: @TheTumbleingTusky I wouldn't say picked off, he kept running into 1v4's even after yasuo was on a killstreak and the other team had baron, morde threw that. Plus, his team just trickled into fights at the end and weren't coordinated
[5:09:09] Craylith: @itmeJP It also seems nearly impossible to stay undected nowadays with all the surveillance and databases
[5:09:11] Tury4l: if you wanted to progress humanity then living a long time could help
[5:09:12] MisterEktos: @itmeJP there are also things you would only do because you know you have unlimited time
[5:09:13] Luke90toko: The deepest thoughts ever said during a lol stream...
[5:09:25] Big_Headed_Gamer: atpDance
[5:09:41] Prrophett: Being a mental health counselor has changed my perspective on life a ton recently
[5:09:41] Darkaros: ddHuh I walked away is there philosophy now instead of vampire sess
[5:09:44] Sir_RobsterRoll: KEKW
[5:09:45] ForestGumo: “Life is what you make of it with the time you have”
[5:09:45] Poobzee: @Craylith in true blood vamps are integrated
[5:09:46] Achubra: now for the irelia win streak
[5:09:47] noble_arya: KEKW
[5:09:48] afreak10: LUL
[5:09:50] Sir_RobsterRoll: ant-man? who's ant-man?
[5:09:53] br4nd0nh347: or stay in the shadows
[5:09:55] Laursi_: Paul Rudd is for sure
[5:09:57] Sonatta: Tom Cruise is definitely a vampire
[5:09:58] Daruvik: Paul Rudd literally doesn't age, it fits the profile ijpNODDERS
[5:09:59] Deadlyguz: prob? i though it was well known
[5:10:02] br4nd0nh347: or protect the planet
[5:10:06] Sir_RobsterRoll: @Daruvik that's the truth
[5:10:08] Felgrun: Is that amumu or shyv top?
[5:10:09] iUncouth: shyvana top?
[5:10:14] NotMyPersona: I mean Keanu is prob a vampire too
[5:10:16] Craylith: @Poobzee Sure. I was talking more real world.
[5:10:22] thesilentcacophony: dont you need to stay under radar so no one knows you are immortal?
[5:10:25] afreak10: @NotMyPersona he's too nice tho :)
[5:10:27] thatguyuknow985: Paul Rudd is a highlander. He keeps dueling other youths to the death to keep his youth.
[5:10:31] snyft: Think you wait for a setup if possible
[5:10:32] Priithee: when they flee i think
[5:10:38] Cstyle12: Did you buy those Irelia skins or are they from boxes
[5:10:39] Sonatta: @afreak10 he's a vampire with a soul ijpNODDERS
[5:10:40] i_revarm: what i like   doing in fights
[5:10:41] Joebeezer: use minion to gap close while using second e
[5:10:42] Daruvik: mid-fight is best usually, or to escape/when they escape
[5:10:42] Felgrun: Throw E behind you and try to predict movement? Idk
[5:10:43] Prrophett: Dont ask me Im still in wood tier
[5:10:43] i_revarm: is ult
[5:10:45] Riluske: Yeha, do you throw it out when they run away?
[5:10:46] NotMyPersona: @NotMyPersona Very true I take that back
[5:10:48] Sparky95_: I see some people E, then Q towards the champ with minions, then E again to quickly stun
[5:10:49] Big_Headed_Gamer: there's many ways you can use that stun
[5:10:49] i_revarm: q   in and use my  e after
[5:10:51] afreak10: @Sonatta ijpKEK
[5:10:53] Kyrvix: Stunning someone with E allows you to reset your Q so you can Q someone twice
[5:10:53] xNullSkillz: try to start with e, then u can q them and get a reset
[5:10:54] Tury4l: someone saud E > Q > E earlier
[5:10:54] sond23: Your E, then Q near him and second cast E
[5:10:55] i_revarm: its  pretty reliable
[5:10:56] Eggkamper: You get a Free q if you hit just whenever you are serten you hit it
[5:10:59] TheTumbleingTusky: max your pasive and than use your E to tart the fight
[5:11:01] Big_Headed_Gamer: early game I would def suggest poking if you land it
[5:11:07] Daruvik: but turning on smart-cast makes placing the 'E' much faster, but takes getting used to it for the aiming
[5:11:08] DawnofFrost_art: The way to do it is E to start the Stun and then Q to a low HP minion then Second E to stun and then onto the stun target @itmeJP
[5:11:09] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[5:11:09] Nerki77: lvl 1-4 get 4 passive stack and auto attack to death the enemy
[5:11:13] rHakkar: Im Iron so feel free to ask me anything @itmeJP
[5:11:26] Deadlyguz: @itmeJP your ulty snares so it makes it easier to land stun. u can use the stun to zone if you are wining lane but try to mix it up don't lead with it all the time
[5:11:31] KnightofZero2182: you should watch her spotlight after this game @itmeJP
[5:11:37] afreak10: yeah
[5:11:39] InsidiousKettle: max out passive then e for engage
[5:11:40] Omakie: e then q on them then w there ability then ult then q again. e will auto cast at your feet
[5:11:40] Darkaros: Kayle and Irelia's lines seem so whiny and melodramatic
[5:11:50] Sparky1232: yes
[5:11:52] Joebeezer: yes
[5:11:52] sond23: yes
[5:11:53] afreak10: yes
[5:11:54] Rezz284: she is their leader
[5:11:55] sunflower204: yes
[5:11:55] Omakie: yep
[5:11:56] Rezz284: iirc
[5:11:56] Kymix: nah
[5:11:58] InsidiousKettle: yea
[5:12:00] Sir_RobsterRoll: ionian master race LUL
[5:12:02] TheTumbleingTusky: yes
[5:12:03] Kymix: just a big fan
[5:12:04] Sir_RobsterRoll: yep
[5:12:08] NotMyPersona: She is from asia yes
[5:12:09] Haeher: Maybe it changes with a different skin don’t know if LOL does that with skins rooIsee
[5:12:12] TheTumbleingTusky: yup
[5:12:14] MasqureMan: Yes
[5:12:17] Darkaros: new prediction please read fine print
[5:12:18] Sparky95_: As much as Ionia has a leader
[5:12:22] ChiZWorkshop: what you get to choose?
[5:12:24] Eggkamper: Noxian
[5:12:30] xNullSkillz: nah man freljord all the way
[5:12:36] NotMyPersona: Top lane shyvana Pog
[5:12:37] Lucien_NM: Void has the most OP Characters
[5:12:42] Omakie: oh shoot darkaros mixing it up
[5:12:44] Sparky95_: Ionia gets railed by noxus in lore tho ;-;
[5:12:46] i_revarm: @itmeJP i think wickd has a short video on irelia, its  a couple  of years old  so  itemization isnt accurate  but it could  teach you a  couple  of things and its  a  short  vid
[5:12:59] KAHVITEK: I dont think you can get much more Ionian than Irelia is.
[5:13:01] teeders: you can literally right click that champ and win
[5:13:02] br4nd0nh347: that depends, op in the game or in that realm
[5:13:18] afreak10: ignite
[5:13:19] JellyCubed: @KAHVIGEN What about Sett?  He's a pretty badass one, right?
[5:13:36] zucroh: he could destroy her so hard if he would just attack her :)
[5:13:43] OhTenGeneral: Everyone wants to be the carry in this league
[5:13:44] afreak10: let him learn
[5:13:44] Big_Headed_Gamer: gets easier when you perfect that E
[5:13:47] RlDennis: Irelia kinda depends on hitting her stun
[5:13:48] Big_Headed_Gamer: don't stress
[5:13:50] Nerki77: she had ignite you missed e and didint used ur q
[5:13:53] Riluske: bronze is bully tier?
[5:14:03] IndiePyromancer: is irelia weak early game, strong late kinda champ?
[5:14:07] Big_Headed_Gamer: bronze is aggro elo
[5:14:16] Big_Headed_Gamer: everyone pushes chases kills etc etc
[5:14:17] zucroh: nop, irelia is strong every second of the game
[5:14:17] Darkaros: @EvocationCat yeh she's a carry
[5:14:22] sunflower204: you could win that, but she outplayed you.
[5:14:23] Caerbae: no irelia is just strong then stronger evocation
[5:14:27] br4nd0nh347: @itmeJP just fyi your Q heals, so if you prep the minions you can last hit q them for heals and stacks
[5:14:31] KAHVITEK: @JellyCubed, iirc Sett is not ionian.
[5:14:32] i_revarm: irelia  has matchups  where   you need tobe careful early, but for  the most part she  slays
[5:14:39] afreak10: back
[5:14:43] Ebra: KEKW
[5:14:49] IndiePyromancer: @Darkaros  @Caerbae I see! thank you
[5:14:50] Connor_Obrady: Big oof DX
[5:14:51] zucroh: irelia with stacked passive wins vs pretty much anyone in the game early
[5:14:55] InsidiousKettle: he did ping Keepo
[5:15:10] rHakkar: LUL
[5:15:14] StarPogPlatinum: :tf: 4

[5:15:51] StarPogPlatinum: lmao shyv
[5:15:57] NotMyPersona: Proxy Shyv LUL
[5:15:57] Kymix: oof
[5:15:57] Bojack_The_Horseman: lol
[5:15:57] Big_Headed_Gamer: free kill
[5:16:02] Big_Headed_Gamer: she is not a proxy champ
[5:16:04] Big_Headed_Gamer: fight that hoe
[5:16:05] Kymix: where is your jungler?
[5:16:05] Darkaros: im so confused by this proxy terminology
[5:16:09] zucroh: this shyv tho NotLikeThis
[5:16:10] RlDennis: Think you should've fought there, you had your passive stacked up and her E was down.
[5:16:10] Darkaros: dota uses "wave cutting" LMAO
[5:16:21] teeders: just fight her lma
[5:16:37] m3rcer: if only ur jg had map awareness to help
[5:16:37] DrewGamer: honestly, not a bad strat for you since irelia is one of the easiest champs to last hit under turret xD
[5:16:37] futanahri_: omg
[5:16:38] Ebra: KEKW
[5:16:38] its__fil: LUL
[5:16:39] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[5:16:42] Riluske: damn
[5:16:42] Joebeezer: LUL
[5:16:43] rHakkar: that waws a good try tho
[5:16:49] Riluske: so close tho
[5:16:49] i_revarm: unfortunate
[5:16:51] ZeniteZero: Solid fight, tbh
[5:16:51] teeders: with stacks they dropped rip
[5:16:58] Rezz284: that was unfortunately ignite dif i think
[5:17:01] i_revarm: with  the pot  and a dodge on her  spell
[5:17:03] m3rcer: oh hey look now they come
[5:17:04] i_revarm: it was so close
[5:17:08] zucroh: @itmeJP you need to fight when you have passive active, you went in right as the passive expired
[5:17:09] afreak10: that noc
[5:17:12] sunflower204: why is she playing like that?
[5:17:13] MasqureMan: Lane Shyv naturally pushes a lot if they use their W
[5:17:53] zucroh: passive is 60% of irelia dmg
[5:18:12] StarPogPlatinum: Don't forget you can tank hits with your W
[5:18:13] Achubra: ive seen some irelias poke with it
[5:18:15] Felgrun: Use it defensively I guess
[5:18:15] aircable: did she just miss the bush with her ward
[5:18:22] Insigmada: damn she is aggro
[5:18:26] RlDennis: Yeah, she's relatively weak without her passive stacks early on
[5:18:37] Pickedaname_: It allows her to roam opponents jungle and forces JP to farm at tower
[5:18:40] Dbrn47: some aggro top lanes today
[5:18:41] TheTumbleingTusky: you wanna block her q with your w
[5:19:07] Kymix: that why irelia is tough to learn. you have to learn how to mitigate the most damage with your w
[5:19:16] Kymix: fiora is about tthe same
[5:19:43] afreak10: ping her life
[5:20:07] Poobzee: nobody moved lol
[5:20:17] Caerbae: do people proxy in NA bronze or are these early season games just all kinds of strange?
[5:20:29] JellyCubed: That was close on the two swords move though.
[5:20:34] Felgrun: @Caerbae Second one
[5:20:36] RlDennis: When you have your passive stacked up like that youu can definitely try to fight
[5:20:38] Achubra: shes not being punished for her aggression by noc so shes goin buck wild
[5:20:48] Poobzee: bot getting all the attention
[5:20:48] RlDennis: When you have a health advantage ofcourse
[5:21:06] NotYourLad: you can def go on her with ult
[5:21:06] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Caerbae literally the only champ i ever seen that is ACTUALLY suppose to proxy is singed. idk if it's a new season thing or just this terrible elo.
[5:21:06] snailanvil: whens ff14?
[5:21:08] Romantau: ratJAM
[5:21:11] zucroh: that shyv saw someone do it so she thinks she should do it i think, she is playing really bad so 100% not a smurf
[5:21:18] IndiePyromancer: free kill top? think I'd die bot instead SeemsGood
[5:21:41] afreak10: EZ
[5:21:42] JellyCubed: Anyone have thoughts on the upcoming champion Zeri?
[5:21:43] Ebra: OOOO
[5:21:47] tyreese006: free kills top lane is filmed in front of a live studio audience
[5:21:48] Poobzee: lil late lol
[5:21:49] Darkaros: @snailanvil on this channel? probably not for a while; JP doesn't want to organize a raiding group and peeps are busy with schedules
[5:21:55] WantedOne: finally shows up, and was not needed
[5:21:56] NotMyPersona: Nice gank noc
[5:22:03] Omakie: irelia is a learning curve and your getting there good job jp
[5:22:03] Felgrun: Irelia in a nutshell
[5:22:09] moraph321: She charged into tower with 33%hp, that's how you did it
[5:22:09] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[5:22:14] Jukettaja: lol
[5:22:15] Niehilius: To fight, you should stack up your passive as people are mentioning
[5:22:18] snailanvil: @Darkaros awww dang thx for tellin me
[5:22:20] rHakkar: @snailanvil Man thats too bad, was hopping for the raids
[5:22:21] Niehilius: that's most of your damage
[5:22:40] Niehilius: I believe you take less damage when channeling w, so use it defensively
[5:22:42] Big_Headed_Gamer: another stupid jungler
[5:22:44] Big_Headed_Gamer: shame
[5:22:53] zucroh: @itmeJP until you learn how E works better, just get 4 passive stacks, ult and go in and auto attack. You will win 80% of duels like that
[5:23:10] NotMyPersona: Rip tower
[5:23:13] RlDennis: That's .. pretty solid advice LUL
[5:23:28] Samstein: @zucroh ye but he also have to use it to learn it.
[5:23:34] TelosVelox: LOL dude is in such a hurry to leave every game, not ganna learn a damn thing or get better but league things
[5:23:36] RlDennis: Lux? LUL
[5:23:38] Ebra: KEKW
[5:23:41] xDreadnord: umm
[5:23:44] DrYaguar: KEKW
[5:23:45] Saryuken: A random lux appears to the stage
[5:23:47] afreak10: she went all the way from the river
[5:23:50] Sir_RobsterRoll: :D
[5:23:50] Notenoughcoffee: LUL
[5:23:51] NotMyPersona: Every day i play league
[5:23:52] Big_Headed_Gamer: he's trolling
[5:23:53] sunflower204: he flashed for nothing
[5:23:54] Dalek__Kahn: That was an interesting route for the Lux to take
[5:23:59] TelosVelox: sorry you are stuck with this troll team
[5:24:00] Poobzee: noc still underlevel
[5:24:01] TDotTerror: Little Light took a little nap.
[5:24:18] Ebra: OOOO
[5:24:23] IndiePyromancer: the lux positioning was amazing LUL
[5:24:23] Riluske: nice
[5:24:26] RlDennis: gj
[5:24:27] Big_Headed_Gamer: noc is triggered and potentially throwing :(
[5:24:34] Fateborn: At least top lane is getting more attention than last game.
[5:24:48] zucroh: True but E is a strange spell, takes time to get used to it
[5:24:49] Felgrun: @itmeJP You should always keep your passive in mind, its really strong
[5:24:51] RlDennis: Hard push, back get botrk and maybe you can fight? I have no clue what Shyv has
[5:25:04] Joebeezer: no one won lane. it happens
[5:25:09] Rezzak77: be me, top tower, 3 of them infront of it, all of a sudden lux appears coming down lane, wtf i say
[5:25:22] Darkaros: YAPPP Mother. Father. Mailman. Clerk. Jane from the Nursery...
[5:25:25] RlDennis: Yeah, you can stack it up on minions
[5:25:28] m3rcer: the dmg
[5:25:34] Dalek__Kahn: well, it was a kill
[5:25:35] Nurama: an easy way is to W the wave, which gets back minions low then you can easy stack all three of those
[5:25:40] OdinX1: I think a good way to play her is to  Q kill minions then Q a person, as your go in after 4
[5:25:43] Nurama: if you level w first so it does enough damage that is
[5:25:48] Nurama: well second
[5:25:48] MasqureMan: Yo, that Corki skin is sick
[5:25:53] Loyrl: ijpH ijpH
[5:26:10] Felgrun: oh
[5:26:11] Baxian: what was that big bug thing that ran itself into the turets?

[5:26:20] Baske_T: @Baxian herald
[5:26:22] OhTenGeneral: so nocturne ulted into jungle instead of helping at inhib
[5:26:33] Joebeezer: you are building armor against ap tbf
[5:26:35] zucroh: well you didn't q her, i think you win that :)
[5:26:39] Storme_Solos: 2 levels behind and against shyv in ulti is a bit questionable xD
[5:26:40] Shaimaal: if she takes the inhib it is actually good for you
[5:26:43] Niehilius: well, she is very fed 😅
[5:26:46] Poobzee: dont guys theres minions on the inhib no big deal lol
[5:26:49] Xeby17: I just had the greatest league moment, my lane opponent said well played after I killed him in a close duel
[5:26:56] OhTenGeneral: I guess he took offense to your response to those first pings and decided to never help again
[5:27:00] Dalek__Kahn: Most of the enemy team is fed
[5:27:09] RlDennis: She's kinda strong right now yeah. Does she still gain resistances for each dragon killed by her team?
[5:27:11] NotMyPersona: You love to hear an enemy is godlike Kappa
[5:27:16] br4nd0nh347: chat remember it's his second time playing the champ, I don't think he's even seen the 4 stacks strat
[5:27:29] zucroh: he almost won and didn't q her at all or use ult, it's crazy how strong irelia passive is
[5:27:29] Felgrun: Nocturne is dealing negative damage to that ammumu
[5:27:38] Felgrun: 1000 gold Pog
[5:27:39] Pickedaname_: @baxian it's a limited time -map objective- that helps destroy towers quickly when characters are weak

[5:40:23] Insigmada: Does it act as a wall too?
[5:40:33] zucroh: it slows when they run in the walls

[5:41:53] i_revarm: she  likes those  m atchups alot more
[5:42:02] i_revarm: just  in general terms
[5:42:04] Pickedaname_: B U L L I E D
[5:42:06] StarPogPlatinum: more like 200 IQ
[5:42:10] NotMyPersona: Irelia's aa range is bonkers GD
[5:42:11] zucroh: smartcast
[5:42:11] Felgrun: Mouse speed
[5:42:12] Ebra: smart casting @itmeJP
[5:42:13] Kirino20: smart cast

[5:42:17] Omakie: smart cast on e
[5:42:21] xmlgprorpx: quickcast/smartcast
[5:42:22] Ebra: no you dont
[5:42:29] zucroh: i think you have smartcast with indicators ?
[5:42:31] Joebeezer: I don't think you do
[5:42:36] RlDennis: What is fast? the E?
[5:42:42] Baske_T: @RlDennis yes
[5:42:44] StarPogPlatinum: He have a good apm too, looks how he's clicking with his mouse
[5:42:44] Shaimaal: her E used to be faster the shorter the distance, but they removed that
[5:43:05] RlDennis: If you cast the E Far away and then closer to you it's alot faster. but they did remove that yeah
[5:43:07] xhriiis: with full stacks yea
[5:43:08] Hopsinka: she hits very hard with max stacks
[5:43:09] i_revarm: her passive is broken
[5:43:19] afreak10: geez
[5:43:27] Omakie: she is nutty damage at 4 stacks
[5:43:31] scooterjr37: she has to have the 4 stacks
[5:43:31] Joebeezer: it's all about hitting that stun
[5:43:32] afreak10: u played too safe
[5:43:33] Omakie: but stacks are everything
[5:43:34] Joebeezer: and passive
[5:43:37] br4nd0nh347: that's why chat was saying to get 4 stacks
[5:43:42] RitzC: just gotta work on ur q resets
[5:43:42] Baske_T: I don't think yuo played aronud the 4 stacks which is why you didn't see it
[5:43:43] OdinX1: Yeah, that was what i was trying to say with what i said earlier 4 stacks from minions then you all in someone most of the time
[5:43:45] Pickedaname_: Check opps items
[5:43:49] OdinX1: and  you just win trades because of damage + attack speed
[5:43:51] DigitalKnight03: it's all about her stacks
[5:43:54] Catzumo: bronze in chat, isnt the new lethal tempo buff for melee pretty strong on her these days?
[5:43:55] zucroh: that's why we said passive is broken, she gains like almost a extra complete item with 4 passive stacks
[5:43:57] Price_FTW: i almost dislike the video simply because i feel like all of these clips were attained by stomping lower level players instead of playing at even skill
[5:44:19] jessyloxxx: @Price_FTW look top left when there is a fight, 90% of times they are even
[5:44:41] Hemanse: danHmm i am already lost

[5:44:53] Price_FTW: @jessyloxxx even in score doesnt mean even in skill though.. dude could be a diamond player smurfing and ruining games of lower level players and thats where i take issue
[5:44:54] Hopsinka: only what u target
[5:44:55] Victo0: @itmeJP no, you want to q the minions to stack passive
[5:44:55] Rezz284: that is just prepping passive
[5:44:59] RlDennis: Q is targeted damage only
[5:45:05] jessyloxxx: @Price_FTW true that
[5:45:07] afreak10: PauseChamp
[5:45:10] TomNook: cliffhanger
[5:45:13] Bubblewrapz: Oh Q, no it doesn't
[5:45:27] AdrenALI_N: "is be impatient with your...." finameLUL
[5:45:30] ZeniteZero: Impatient with WHAT, cmon, don't leave us hanging! Kappa
[5:45:32] Hopsinka: lol imagine if that works like that holy LUL
[5:45:36] Price_FTW: what are we impatient with!?
[5:45:46] Insigmada: lol that 50% guess in to i didn't hear what he said
[5:45:51] fladerade: that would be so broken if people took damage if she just passed through them while qing
[5:46:03] afreak10: ye
[5:46:09] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[5:46:30] AdrenALI_N: so, is this video sounding more like new advice or that you are being patronised, cause they can often fall under either finameNom
[5:47:02] zucroh: @itmeJP at level 1, with 4 stacks of passive you gain more attackspeed and dmg per auto than a recurve bow that costs 1k gold..it's bonkers.
[5:48:19] afreak10: ijpKEK
[5:48:28] Hopsinka: well challengers irelias propably yes
[5:48:54] Kymix: those irelia plays are nuts
[5:48:55] RlDennis: And he was 1/3 vs aatrox there aswell LUL
[5:49:04] RomanticCreampie: fuck irelia
[5:49:06] Kymix: that irelia was just q to dodge most of aatrox's damage
[5:49:24] Hopsinka: she has really high skill cap
[5:49:29] RlDennis: yeah
[5:49:31] Baske_T: auto attack and Q spam
[5:49:33] Omakie: auto attack and use minions
[5:49:33] afreak10: yea
[5:49:38] xmlgprorpx: yes LUL
[5:49:38] Darkaros: MmmHmm this happens with Ember Spirit too in Dota KEKW
[5:49:39] RlDennis: It's passive management and auto attacking
[5:49:58] afreak10: W before E
[5:50:24] Lucien_NM: what did you 8
[5:50:25] jessyloxxx: she just killing 0/5 mundo here, cmon
[5:50:26] Omakie: yep
[5:50:27] RlDennis: It doesn't mark them
[5:50:27] Hopsinka: YEP
[5:50:31] eisey8: and that right there is why league isn't as fun any more. "You can outplay on accident" and so many champions are made like that nowadays
[5:50:31] Shaimaal: no
[5:50:32] Sweet_Threat: honestly there a lot of champs that have such problematic kits that they should be removed from Ranked/Normal games and left for PTR/customs until Riot figures out how to balance them
[5:50:33] AdrenALI_N: roman cancel coxPog
[5:50:33] RlDennis: It just makes it easier to finish them off
[5:50:36] Shaimaal: W doesnt mark them
[5:50:42] xmlgprorpx: w doesnt mark
[5:50:45] zucroh: it doesn't mark the, you just get the most dmg out of it
[5:50:47] Bubblewrapz: E and R is the only thing that marks
[5:50:49] RlDennis: It's about maximizing damage uptime, basically
[5:50:50] Sha1yen: rooHi evening chat. What are we watching?
[5:50:55] afreak10: LUL
[5:50:55] m3rcer: its just for extra dmg right b4 they get out of Q range
[5:50:57] Ebra: KEKW
[5:51:00] i_revarm: he was ahead  at least LUL
[5:51:01] Hopsinka: KEKW
[5:51:01] Darkaros: Irelia guide MmmHmm by SkillCapped
[5:51:01] Ebra: she can do 1v5
[5:51:05] garry_leonard: She was 5/2
[5:51:07] i_revarm: 21-1-1 this cliup lmao
[5:51:07] OhTenGeneral: A good Irelia is some serious bullshit
[5:51:09] Price_FTW: hes legitimately playing against people 3/4 ranks below him though.. just abusing them
[5:51:14] NotMyPersona: Now you see why she gets banned a lot
[5:51:15] Kymix: irelia has an insanely high skill cap
[5:51:17] Hopsinka: bro she is fed af LUL
[5:51:23] Shaimaal: he is playing in lower elo lobbys to farm good content :D
[5:51:29] jessyloxxx: lets make a learning video while im 21/1/1
[5:51:39] RitzC: a food irelia player will hard carry any game
[5:51:39] zucroh: tbh with irelia doesn't matter @Price_FTW you just q people and autoattack them to death
[5:51:42] Duo245: a lot about irelia is to be 10/0/0 in lane
[5:51:43] RitzC: good
[5:51:48] Hopsinka: oh
[5:51:55] RlDennis: Alot of champions can do that
[5:51:56] StarPogPlatinum: WAYTOODANK
[5:51:57] Kymix: oh damn
[5:51:58] afreak10: crazy
[5:52:00] Joebeezer: r flash instead of flash r
[5:52:05] xmlgprorpx: MANY champ use that tech
[5:52:06] Ozoaken: some abilities travel with your flash
[5:52:08] AdrenALI_N: @Shaimaal so if you have the skills you can do this? finameT
[5:52:10] i_revarm: nah man you can play  tank irelia and justbe annoying  af LUL
[5:52:13] Hopsinka: ye because if u press first R u already start casing and with flash its faster
[5:52:19] RlDennis: You use R and then flash. @itmeJP ALOT of champions use that
[5:52:36] applebananacake: even amumu use r flash!
[5:52:36] Shaimaal: @AdrenALI_N yes, put jp in an iron 4 lobby and he can do this^^

[5:53:29] AdrenALI_N: point is, who cares if "he's farming content" this is what you should be doing with the character finameNom
[5:53:36] RlDennis: yeah
[5:53:36] Joebeezer: yes
[5:53:38] Price_FTW: yeh
[5:53:38] polymurderous: yes
[5:53:39] afreak10: ye
[5:53:41] xmlgprorpx: yes
[5:53:46] polymurderous: freshly nerfed
[5:54:00] xmlgprorpx: meh that nerf isnt that bad
[5:54:06] m3rcer: @Insigmada does mechanics = apm? cohhHmm or maybe he str8 said no apm needed? rooThink
[5:54:06] Shaimaal: @AdrenALI_N yes, but he is going on a smurf to make himself look better, thats the issue i have
[5:54:17] aikkoru: doesnt look hard 4Head
[5:54:22] Joebeezer: he's ready, chat
[5:54:23] MrTrotty: shiledbow just got nerfed, might not be too good rn

[5:54:30] CadaverLuke: i believe in you JP
[5:54:35] Vendiktuss: how hard can it be right OOOO
[5:54:38] Luxtra_: @itmeJP i always look at champion spotlights when having trouble with or against a champ knowing a champ's mechanics is a big deal cohhGV
[5:54:38] NotMyPersona: Watch all that just for the your team to ban irelia
[5:54:40] Hopsinka: now try these plays like in video Kappa
[5:54:44] ladderoat: looks easy 4Head
[5:54:46] RitzC: JP hard carry lets goo

[5:55:02] deexor: key takeaways: push q, other buttons and hope for the best
[5:55:04] zucroh: shieldbow still the best 2nd item on her imo
[5:55:05] Insigmada: m3rcer it was into reference to the combo to hide your stun totems things
[5:55:08] AdrenALI_N: @Shaimaal its a silly non-issue, the only objective of this video should be to learn what your character does and why.  Doing what you need to to make your points clear is neither here nor there finameLUL

[5:55:31] chowdubs: just smash q and act like your winning
[5:55:39] NotMyPersona: @Sha1yen He went 6-6 yesterday
[5:55:40] i_revarm: @zucroh probably the  one  to go most frequently, butdont  underestimate the tankier options, they can be crazy vs some comps
[5:55:53] i_revarm: goredrinker  vs alot of  melees   comes  to mind LUL
[5:55:57] Spooky_Turtle_Wang: balanced as all things should be FeelsOkayMan

[5:57:56] Sha1yen: DrYaguar incorrect. Jungle and ADC are basically the only 2 roles people get filled into
[5:57:57] xmlgprorpx: cho top yi jungle
[5:57:59] freka_man: lool
[5:58:00] Dalek__Kahn: There are usually a ton of ADC's in queue, so being autofilled adc is rare

[6:02:45] OhTenGeneral: Cho is pretty strong against you early but you outscale him very hard
[6:02:54] Hopsinka: cant be worse than lacari he still learning gwen after 1k games LUL

[6:03:26] Athleon: the stun is tricky to learn for sure
[6:03:27] Yozki: Does it though?
[6:03:35] Sha1yen: The E definitely takes some getting used to. It feels very sluggish at first
[6:03:37] Ebra: KEKW
[6:03:42] Pickedaname_: I think you outscale Cho. His dmg is low, his sustain isn't good in combat
[6:03:43] bronze_aged: actual help Pog
[6:03:45] OhTenGeneral: @mystereSC It slows enemies when it lands and stuns them if he steps into it while giving him a shield
[6:03:46] RlDennis: Only thing to improve there is to put the second E in his escape path, so even if he dodges you get another few autos
[6:03:58] Joebeezer: at least your jungler has your back this game jp
