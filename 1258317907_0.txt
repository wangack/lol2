[0:33:24] PukiMan: how is there nothing wrong doing it? twitch can't claim they wern't aware of it happening when their employees taking a part of it

[0:33:28] djraven216: Yeah accountability

[0:34:30] Crendall: most publishers give conditions for streaming.
[0:34:31] al301able: didnt Pewdiepie get hit form the firewatch devs?
[0:34:31] German_LoCaD: Back to the Streamers should just buy a streaming license.

[0:34:42] BarryCarlyon: @noylraCyrraB I also welcome what @Darkaros said
[0:34:42] NinjaXI: hell back in the day jim sterling, tb and them had videos about game companies taking shit down every week
[0:34:43] Hundisilm: Only Chess streams shall remain
[0:34:48] Devlind: alot of publishers have it in that you can stream and use game footage for creative work though
[0:34:48] SlipCrit: aslo most devs have realised its good for marketing
[0:34:49] Gynocopter: Modern games have it literally written into some EULA's to be able to share it
[0:34:49] MaxVolume: And companies are even paying streamers to play their stuff
[0:34:49] InsanityRequiem: For the most part, game devs and publishers allow and have it stated it's okay to stream/make videos.
[0:34:50] Renaise: TBF they didnt actually do anything to any persona 5 streamer
[0:34:51] Ciefon: that's just semantics though

[0:35:01] JimWho: Hey @noylraCyrraB ijpHI
[0:35:03] bakavic: didnt TB have a years long feud with sega over Shining Force videos?
[0:35:06] GrannySith: that's a bad take, IMO. there is no real difference legally.
[0:35:07] MrJinPengyou: All we're saying is it's Wheat and Barry's fault
[0:35:08] Ciefon: in the eyes of the law it's the same
[0:35:11] BarryCarlyon: most of the game DMCA's are when someone does a game before release.
[0:35:12] GayAngelGabriel: but if you watch an older season of master chef it could make you interested in the newest show
[0:35:22] ZeoBishop: it is all Grey

[0:35:23] koanchap: Nonpublic domain books, yep

[0:36:19] koanchap: I remember Levar Burton wanted public domain or an author to give rights to read on stream

[0:36:19] duskps: Zeke you criminal
[0:36:23] Ciefon: @Dratt_ this is why it shouldn't be up to companies whether to enforce laws or not
[0:36:24] Myr_01: yeah, audiobooks are big business
[0:36:32] WDForty: i feel the difference between playing video games vs streaming tv shows, and like cooking a recipe from a cookbook vs reading that book on stream
[0:36:33] Siggenlh: you can read books that is "out of copyright".
[0:36:33] freetownJoe: anneActually
[0:36:35] Zaelsus: The closest would be you reading out the recipes from the cookbook during Whiskey Sweet @itmeJP
[0:36:35] Tighron: ONly th eones  who ar eodl enough to become public domain
[0:36:38] CastIronJake: I thought you could read a book on air because it is transformative work? that's how there are so many books read on youtube? glad to know thats not right

[0:37:06] SlipCrit: thyed be crazy to do it toh
[0:37:07] XeiZ: the more important part is that devs are in on the streaming industry, movie companies are not and wont be
[0:37:07] Cephyric: InternetPlumber No he can't, DMCA only applies to digital content - it's in the name
[0:37:08] JujuPwns: nintendo did it to youtube vids i think
[0:37:08] Victorunox: Never woulda thought Zeke would be going to jail for reading a book on stream Kappa
[0:37:10] Gingerprimer: @coryocalypse exaclty games streams just existst due to youtube/twitch is the best form of adversting for games
[0:37:14] bansheehero: @BarryCarlyon Works of many kinds can be copyrighted. Selling or not.
[0:37:14] Scientist__: youtube too
[0:37:18] MarshallOnline: well watching a game stream can sell it bc people want to play. Where watching a movie you already see it so why would you go buy it after the stream
[0:37:18] Oinned: baseline. everything you do is dmcaable. keep on clenching on ;)
[0:37:19] GrannySith: but that's just beacause there's this fragile understanding within the gaming sphere

[0:37:43] Aerodozz: Because game devs make more money from games being streamed probably
[0:37:43] Athorm: danganronpa did it

[0:37:51] LordArkady5: cohh giving them ideas

[0:37:53] ItsNoxid: Didnt atlus didnt want people to stream pass x date and people did it anyways
[0:38:00] Creakly: gamers are ruthless to companies that try
[0:38:02] FaramirRat: Its not completely the same, you play the game, you don't play books or movies.
[0:38:06] Estegard: @itsnoxid Yes
[0:38:17] DreamyPants: Streaming games sells games, streaming shows counterfeits sales is the big difference
[0:38:23] Korhazen: @FaramirRat what about story heavy games?
[0:38:30] woundedpoptart: hgtv is already talking to streamers about it
[0:38:32] BakinPacman: its all metrics i guess
[0:38:37] XeiZ: but why would they? i'll just watch the new season on xqcs channel
[0:38:37] Melgor101: lobosWave
[0:38:37] JujuPwns: if i've seen a movie, AI rarely watch it again, but watching a game being played is different. I can play that game and experience it my own way. Very different things in terms of what the viewers gets out of it i think
[0:38:40] Gynocopter: If there was an ancient aliens streamer I'd be watching it right now
[0:38:44] Cephyric: InternetPlumber DMCA specifically cannot be enforced against non-digital content,, there are other copyright law enforcement mediums for that (the M stands for Millenium btw, not Medium)
[0:38:44] educated_monkey: let's hope so
[0:38:44] BDave: they do not give a fuck
[0:38:44] KDogg241: HGTV wants people to stream their stuff
[0:38:47] Insigmada: This reminds me when JP got whole shows clipped to get around the subscription
[0:38:49] GayAngelGabriel: yeah I wouldnt known about master chef if it wasnt for twitch
[0:38:53] koanchap: Hollywood is notoriously out of touch
[0:38:53] Hemry64_: I mean Arcane dipped their toes in something like that I think
[0:38:57] MrJinPengyou: "WTF is Twitch"
[0:39:00] Truder2k: if the production companies sanction it the same way they have for games, sure
[0:39:01] FaramirRat: @Korhazen ya I could see games like Walking dead not wanting their game streamed.
[0:39:01] jatii: I rarely watch things twice, but I do play games I've seen streamed LUL
[0:39:12] Hundisilm: There was a reddit add for using licensed music service - I don't know why it was shown to me but :p
[0:39:17] CastIronJake: It's also issues with dividends to actors ect
[0:39:18] FaramirRat: @Korhazen but even then your making decisions that change the story so
[0:39:23] Creakly: maybe when zoomers get to the top of big tv
[0:39:24] Felgrun: You could stream the first episode of Arcane when it launched I think
[0:39:31] osna523: US only though
[0:39:32] Mrshilka: Arcane is Riot and Riot know what side of its bread the butter is on
[0:39:33] ReginaldXIV: There's a Twitch streamer on Gordon Ramsey's new cooking competition show
[0:39:39] thedarkcrimsonshadow: @itmejp what if there were TV channel Representatives like Fox picks Cohh and then he can watch all Fox shows on his stream for promotion
[0:39:40] Korhazen: @FaramirRat there was a story game like a year or 2 ago that the devs didnt want streamed, dont remember which one
[0:39:43] kasded: Hasan got paid to watch Borat
[0:39:44] BarryCarlyon: Enable the DRM systems
[0:39:46] Devlind: thats region locked right?
[0:39:48] InternetPlumber: @Cephyric I know what it stands for. It also covers any content in a digital medium. Bottom line is if you don't own it you can't broadcast it. The only reason it doesn't happen all the time is because its not worth companies caring about a lot of it
[0:39:48] BakinPacman: the funny thing is that disney one of the hardest leaning on this stuff has also allowed their games on twitch LUL
[0:39:51] Mrshilka: yes us only
[0:39:53] aurice_heartly: yeah Esfand does it and says he cant talk during commercials
[0:39:59] Twizzlar: paramount+ sponsored some of their shows for dansgaming
[0:39:59] imobaka: omg that sounds horrible to restream
[0:40:04] Mrshilka: but its us footballs not like its a real sport
[0:40:05] Estegard: NFL is US only
[0:40:07] woundedpoptart: its so geo locked and annoying
[0:40:11] cant_uppercut: Wasn't Arcane  like that.
[0:40:23] Creakly: region based
[0:40:24] RlDennis: region locking sucks
[0:40:24] Gantzsy: watchparties are paywalled
[0:40:25] AinzN: Mrshilka give me Aussie rules football!
[0:40:25] Ruuno: geo location problems
[0:40:26] yrvengalied: LUL
[0:40:26] JaseLeland: they suck big time
[0:40:26] kasded: YEP
[0:40:28] Cephyric: InternetPlumber JP is not making money from the statues behind him
[0:40:28] Siggenlh: watchparty is janky af
[0:40:28] QuestFor420: KEKW yeah
[0:40:32] Hambubger86: As a Canadian I can confirm watch parties suck
[0:40:33] SyedHaroonAli: KEKW
[0:40:33] Scientist__: ijpKEK ijpSHRUG
[0:40:34] Klassicoops: They do yeah
[0:40:37] layinglow: watched some good shows though
[0:40:38] BarryCarlyon: A given program on Amazon prime is not in all countries. Star Trek is a big one. DS9 is on netflix over here. Not prime.
[0:40:38] TheRawri: not many countries can watch those
[0:40:39] Aerionoth: you want me to pay money to watch shit? KEKW
[0:40:43] yrvengalied: Watched Parties Kappa
[0:40:45] Mrshilka: @AinzN Give me Ainz! ijpH
[0:40:45] Revanmug: I mean, I can't watch anything there almost always region lock
[0:40:45] Shapelessdnb: They need to open it up like the first Episode is free for all to watch.
[0:40:45] JWGK: region locking really ruin it for me
[0:40:51] woundedpoptart: especially while people are watching tv on stream KEKW
[0:40:52] Siggenlh: watchparties are only usefull for inhouse productions
[0:40:53] ZeoBishop: RIP We watch things
[0:40:53] Hemry64_: lately there also seems to be a syncing issue I think
[0:40:54] LimeNade: @itmeJP i did enjoy when you did the expanse watch party awhile ago and we binged irt
[0:40:55] Ciefon: yeah, idea is good
[0:40:55] Ruuno: vinland saga was good though
[0:40:56] JaseLeland: watch parties, more like, kill your viewership parties
[0:40:58] Amazhulaan: Mrshilka ijpH ijpLOOT
[0:41:00] InternetPlumber: @Cephyric JP's stream is making money. the statues are in the background therefor a copany could argue/claim a portion of that revenue
[0:41:03] Freakcho: Sodapoppin did movie nights(watch parties ) and he lost followers alot of them
[0:41:06] Jurmeli_: Wheel of time show KEKW
[0:41:06] Estegard: @CohhCarnage The redeeming point of Watch Parties is that everyone that gets involved in it IS PAYING THE SUBSCRIPTION fee so they all are paying for the content that's being watched
[0:41:07] Sonatta: Expanse FeelsGoodMan
[0:41:08] Mrshilka: @Amazhulaan Amaz! ijpH
[0:41:10] AinzN: Mrshilka buy me dinner and you got it! zekeFLIRT
[0:41:10] topgeeknj: I think most like Banter while gaming but watching a show or move nah shutup i want to watch! lol
[0:41:10] WDForty: a few streamers are making 2nd channels to dedicate to watch parties, but these are also huge 10k+ subs streamers
[0:41:12] Darkaros: I think EU lost access to either Vinland Saga or Downton Abbey on the last few episodes of that Watch Party
[0:41:15] lant3rnknight: prime has region locked shows so half your viewers cant watch.
[0:41:17] Siggenlh: LUL
[0:41:21] Freakcho: ma
[0:41:23] ErikThe_Viking: Vinland Saga was good until Amazon removed the license halfway so I couldnt follow along
[0:41:24] koanchap: LUL
[0:41:30] JimWho: Hey hey @Mrshilka ijpH ijpHI
[0:41:31] bansheehero: I did try to sync recordings, but you end up with different cuts and etc. Watch Parties have so much to do.
[0:41:41] BarryCarlyon: Regional licensing is as much of a mess for shows as DMCA is in general
[0:41:42] Mrshilka: @JimWho Jimmy Pog ijpH
[0:41:42] 14neo: @Mrshilka ijpH ijpBOOP
[0:41:48] Hundisilm: Are you sure its not for the general public not streaming though
[0:41:49] Siggenlh: they just want to diversify into oblivion instead of expand exsiting userbase LUL
[0:41:50] Mrshilka: @14neo 14! ijpH
[0:41:51] Cephyric: InternetPlumber They cannot issue a takedown notice for that, and they would never escalate it to court
[0:41:53] LimeNade: i really did actually like doing The Expanse watcher party with JP when he did it awhile back
[0:41:54] Ciefon: amazon wants to get the audience of big streamers to subscribe to prime
[0:41:58] pc2400: watch parties were there to push prime
[0:42:04] Unkim: Don't think amazon gives a fuck about twitch, let alone watch parties
[0:42:04] Hundisilm: i.e. if you want to watch a show with your remote girlfriend or something
[0:42:05] NinjaPandaEU: @itmeJP The small streamers that I saw being sponsored were big fans of Wheel of Time. Negaoryx, etc.
[0:42:07] Twizzlar: @Siggenlh unironically true, a lot of games do it
[0:42:08] InsanityRequiem: The most success I see with Watch Parties is, hilariously enough, when Japanese VTubers come over to use it.
[0:42:10] Heisuisui: too many hoops
[0:42:14] aurice_heartly: @itmeJP Max dood did a watch party to show Steve the first ALIENS movie... alot ppl loved it but i think its cuz they never ever used it
[0:42:19] Ruuno: the current watchparies is sadly the only correct way it coulsd work. licenses are like that
[0:42:22] Siggenlh: to bad amazon has so few shows not geoblacked that are "worthwhile"
[0:42:25] 14neo: @LimeNade that and 'Invincible' i think
[0:42:25] bairdman: has anyone heard of Tenami?
[0:42:26] FaramirRat: @Unkim they give a fuck when it comes to politics
[0:42:33] Siggenlh: they dont even support pausing LUL
[0:42:34] copycoffeecat: how would twitch go about doing that? they cant just wave their magic wand and make the movie industry give in
[0:42:38] BDave: for Amazon IPs it works
[0:42:41] RlDennis: If Watch Parties had launched along with some more amazon exclusive/owned shows. I think it would've gotten way more traction. Region locking is a huge bummer and I generally don't watch because I just imagine it's always not available in my region
[0:42:41] Serenade212: It’s at least a good indicator of the amount of red tape to navigate
[0:42:44] Geno07P: sounds like the streamers are just asking for the impossible
[0:42:53] imobaka: yea how else would you get more ppl to watch
[0:42:59] LimeNade: @14neo yea i just loved seeing how JP went from like not interested in The Expanse. To going on a bender watching it lol
[0:43:02] WDForty: @itmeJP Watch Parties is now a tool on amazon primevideo now so no need for the twitch inbetween anymore for friends wanting to watch stuff together
[0:43:03] Siggenlh: didnt some streamers jsut download episodes isntead ofg using the watchparty LUL
[0:43:12] ReginaldXIV: The Japanese Vtuber community loves Watch Parties
[0:43:15] Hundisilm: The Expanse watch parties were fun though
[0:43:18] BarryCarlyon: @WDForty and disney "stole" it
[0:43:20] 14neo: @LimeNade he watched so much that i couldn't keep up, but glad you enjoyed ijp7
[0:43:24] Supwizy: I did that @Siggenlh while watching we watch things
[0:43:25] Hemipheistos: zekeYAY Hey yalls
[0:43:36] 1TrueTyrant: @Hundisilm Agreed, I miss them
[0:43:36] WDForty: didn't know disney took it
[0:43:38] Hemry64_: Pog
[0:43:41] Eplesh: CHAINSOWRD Pog
[0:43:41] Mrshilka: Chainsword Pog
[0:43:43] 14neo: KKona Clap
[0:43:43] Stack_Together: I remember there was that show about spies collaborating
[0:43:46] Wildskunk: Pog
[0:43:46] bjartensen: monka
[0:43:49] BarryCarlyon: Yeah both D+ and AP have "on platofmr" start a room and watch a thing.
[0:43:51] JimWho: @Hemipheistos ijpHI
[0:43:51] Melgor101: lobosFall
[0:43:52] Mrshilka: The Emperor Protects NODDERS
[0:43:53] Ka0t1c1985: cohhEvil
[0:44:00] Gank4CE1: monkaW
[0:44:01] Malanor85: Careful now, thats Warhammer, might DMCA that
[0:44:02] Mrshilka: Ultramarines coloured too
[0:44:13] Supwizy: The people that the power of the broadcasting rights have no clue how the internet works
[0:44:27] Mrshilka: yeah Gamesworkshop love dcma
[0:44:32] FaramirRat: @Supwizy true, there all 60+
[0:44:33] NinjaPandaEU: Smurfs are boring. Vlka Fenryka ftw.
[0:44:36] aurice_heartly: friday
[0:44:36] 1TrueTyrant: I mean I think what Riot did with Arcane of letting a few individuals stream some of the show but not all of the show is a step forward in that sense
[0:44:36] Hundisilm: It was only matter of time though right?
[0:44:41] BarryCarlyon: the whole thing here is even more shit, as Paramount pulled Star Trek discovered from Internation netflix the week before the new season started. And then went it'll be on paramount+. But most of EU doesn't have paramount+ yet
[0:44:41] Scientist__: ijpKEK
[0:44:42] GrannySith: Viacom, right?
[0:44:43] IBSammy: Friday NODDERS
[0:44:45] GGuts: And Avatar is on Amazon KEKW
[0:44:46] ReginaldXIV: Avatar: The Last Airbender to be specific
[0:44:59] Mrshilka: @NinjaPandaEU I repect the space puppies as a loyal chapter but in Gulliman I trust
[0:45:00] mephium: oh ATLA
[0:45:01] ReginaldXIV: Does Disney own Master Chef now?
[0:45:03] oRiie: Only a matter of time before someone gets made an example out of and sued into financial ruin
[0:45:04] Opoppopro: @gguts only in na maybe
[0:45:04] HaasGaming: @ReginaldXIV The only Avatar that matters.
[0:45:08] FaramirRat: lol why?
[0:45:13] JimWho: Weird
[0:45:13] BarryCarlyon: @ReginaldXIV it's fox so yeah
[0:45:13] epicshoo: Hmm
[0:45:16] WDForty: so it's a timing race?
[0:45:23] KAWS__: Mizkif was streaming Avatar at the same time as poki but didn’t get banned LUL @itmejp
[0:45:25] Renaise: Did he not delete his vod?
[0:45:27] bakavic: but 1 comes with a free vacation
[0:45:28] GrannySith: suspension
[0:45:29] Supwizy: So you just have to stream when NA is asleep Kappa
[0:45:29] kazen01: strikes matter?
[0:45:29] Sluggs_: ban is better for the streamer
[0:45:32] Lindobu: "worse" Kappa
[0:45:33] Purona: because actively doing something youre not supposed todo
[0:45:33] Ryykerr: suspension vs ban ?
[0:45:34] Sonatta: Pokimane is going to make bank off the ban though
[0:45:35] hulskiey: ban is better cause you get free comeback stream LUL
[0:45:36] Ciefon: probably to stop the act
[0:45:39] Melgor101: lobosS
[0:45:40] Sammonoske: Ban is worthless if it's temp
[0:45:40] ZeoBishop: that is twitch in a nutshell
[0:45:41] jaxkmurphy: The ban is better
[0:45:41] mirautaj: 48 hour vacation Kappa
[0:45:41] X4320: ban sounds better, you can do a welcome back stream and get subs
[0:45:41] aurice_heartly: VIACOM goes HARD
[0:45:43] Gynocopter: "worse" Copium
[0:45:45] Gingerprimer: @Supwizy also for them twitch is money wise a drop in the bucket for theese ppl boradcasting right deals are enourmous
[0:45:47] jaxkmurphy: You make more money off of the ban
[0:45:47] me548604: 2 day vacation and no actual suspension.  what a serious punishment Kappa
[0:45:48] Legionnare92: caught in the act vs "dont do it again"
[0:45:48] sneakypooo: I kinda hate the word "ban" in this context, shouldn't it be called "suspension" or something to that effect?
[0:45:50] BobbiTheDragon: how long does the strike last on your channel?
[0:45:50] LSP_Strenuous: @itmejp Ramsey found out what twitch was on Next Level Chef from a twitch streamer competing
[0:45:50] Wildskunk: ban = free publicity
[0:45:52] Itz_AllWaySonny: LUL protocol is protocol. That’s what was written.
[0:45:54] pc2400: They should start doing 1 month bans
[0:45:55] Stack_Together: There’s dodge chance for strike Kappa
[0:45:57] InternetPlumber: not just fox/disney. you can also get a takedown from anyone who has distribution rights in that region
[0:45:58] Mrshilka: better for twitch too cause they get 50% of the return streamer revenue
[0:46:02] Renaise: Timeout is more accurate xD
[0:46:05] Scientist__: is it 3 bans and you're out ?
[0:46:06] IBSammy: I would think it's to stop them abruptly? So they can't keep streaming it that night
[0:46:07] aurice_heartly: Pokimane gets a 2 day vacation, FREE Publicity, & comes back with a 12 hr stream
[0:46:11] sajro94: Is a ban the only way twitch can stop a stream?
[0:46:13] Matzuka: What kinda Wednesday is this?
[0:46:13] Cephyric: I would assume that the Masterchef people issued the takedown on a VOD, whereas Nickelodeon issued it on an actual livestream
[0:46:14] ReggX: Is that how they do the live takedown on a technical level? They use the 48 hour ban to force the channel offline. nagHmm
[0:46:21] woodlaphroaig: GassyMexican do great watch parties of Star Trek where he adds a timestamp on his stream so that you can sync up with the content your self if you can't use prime. So you can add other sources.
[0:46:21] JimWho: Agreed @sneakypooo a bit over used
[0:46:23] duskps: Triumphant Return
[0:46:23] BarryCarlyon: @Strenuouz no quite. Since next level chef was recorded _months_ ago before people were watching it on Twitch
[0:46:24] Scientist__: @Matzuka show is sunday from now on
[0:46:29] Darkaros: !dfsunday Matzuka
[0:46:30] itmeBOT: @Matzuka If you missed the last few Dropped Frames episodes (295, 296; longer explanations within), we're moving to Sunday since it's better for each host's schedules. VODs will be up on YouTube as always if you want to continue enjoying Dropped Frames on Wednesdays!
[0:46:30] Hemry64_: Like when Hasan got ban for a week
[0:46:30] Gank4CE1: moon2CD
[0:46:32] SZebra: I'd love to Twitch to throttle streams post-ban
[0:46:33] yrvengalied: from Music DMCA now they want Hollywood and other type of media to do the DMCAs like in 2020 NotLikeThis
[0:46:37] BarryCarlyon: @woodlaphroaig we do the same thing.
[0:46:38] Icemoth: return stream is still a huge think i think
[0:46:40] DigitalShiver: honestly want them perma banned at this point
[0:46:41] hulskiey: reduce revenue after ban for 1-3 months
[0:46:42] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/DroppedFrames/status/1480236903739842566
[0:46:43] MrJinPengyou: Maybe Zeke has first hand opinion on that lol
[0:46:44] DrellokTV: no monetization for a month
[0:46:46] LCTR_: witholding revenue somehow?
[0:46:47] Sonatta: forfeit income
[0:46:47] Layercake: Perma HahaThink
[0:46:49] oRiie: Start taking huge chunks of peoples money; only way people learn
[0:46:49] imobaka: no ads - a punishment?
[0:46:50] Cronos_100: removing revenue yeah
[0:46:50] InternetPlumber: Perma
[0:46:51] Craylith: @itmeJP It´s also a really great look to get banned for this when you are running a talent agency
[0:46:51] German_LoCaD: Nice that trash gets free holidays ban for life.
[0:46:57] Hemry64_: A month ban would HURT
[0:46:58] MrTrotty: @itmeJP not being able to run ads would be a pro for some streamers
[0:46:59] MaxVolume: Twitch doesn't want to lose revenue, though
[0:46:59] InternetPlumber: you willingly broke the law. Permaban
[0:47:00] Purona: its not Twitchs job to punish the streamer monetarily...
[0:47:02] Creakly: not even youtube does that
[0:47:04] me548604: i intentionally committed a crime and then played the victim card NotLikeThis
[0:47:04] vpopeprohladno: LUL
[0:47:05] Melgor101: towLets towGo
[0:47:05] FlashfreezeBuddha: if you make the bans too long they will change plattforms imo
[0:47:06] BarryCarlyon: @imobaka ads but no ad revenue. They mean
[0:47:07] Ronin702: make them pay the royalties
[0:47:07] Mrshilka: a month means all those primes go elsewhere
[0:47:09] Aerodozz: LUL
[0:47:10] ansaron: Salute our corporate overlords!!!
[0:47:10] KDogg241: KEKW
[0:47:10] Eplesh: KEKW
[0:47:12] jaxkmurphy: Stop calling suspensions where a streamer gets a few days off a ban
[0:47:13] JimWho: LUL Zeke
[0:47:14] Gynocopter: month ban and with-held revenue for a year NODDERS
[0:47:14] Barba06: these streamers have so much money, they won't care about a month either
[0:47:14] Mighty_Rabbit_: KEKW
[0:47:15] Lindobu: disabling monetization is probably the harshest punishment
[0:47:16] aznhai: That's ridiculous cohh, you get banned for less for racism and other stuff; DMCA is such a light offense morally compared to other stuff
[0:47:18] Itz_AllWaySonny: CaitlynS as long as they don’t hire a musical savant to watch streams for DMCA takedowns.
[0:47:18] poldy_: go outside and touch grass rooVV
[0:47:18] Paragleiber: maybe delist the channel from directory for a few days after unban, so only followers will see the return stream
[0:47:19] Ignisgladius: a month ban and all the subs get screwed LUL
[0:47:22] KerwinBJones: if it's a legit dmca thing yeah
[0:47:23] Aerodozz: 3 strikes
[0:47:28] Gank4CE1: KEKHeim
[0:47:28] ReginaldXIV: I'm surprised the Viacom lawyers haven't crunched the numbers on the earnings of these people and started throwing out lawsuits
[0:47:31] woodlaphroaig: @BarryCarlyon that makes sense since it's so hard with where content is available
[0:47:37] Athleon: how about we start with 3 seconds Kappa
[0:47:40] GGuts: There is another small punishment. If you get banned you can't instant upload new emotes anymore. Twitch has to clear each one.
[0:47:42] aurice_heartly: yeah strikes go away after a year
[0:47:49] PukiMan: half a year and a strike ie removed is what I heard
[0:47:51] aurice_heartly: you get 3 strikes per year = perma ban
[0:47:53] kalTorakSF: accidental is one thing, but doing on purpose and trying to circumvent it should be harsher
[0:48:00] Gingerprimer: @Purona problem is when the rights holder gets tired of sending dmca to streamers they will send leagal action to twitch
[0:48:01] FaramirRat: Ya they are doing it in purpose to get a vacation
[0:48:09] FaramirRat: and publicity

[0:48:14] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing kmf_eternal! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:48:17] Takeapples: I read twitch only bans you when live so strikes don't add up to 3 instantly? don't know if true obviously
[0:48:17] InternetPlumber: bullshit or not, its the law in the US
[0:48:21] Craylith: @zznormnormcore How I about hating both?
[0:48:21] imobaka: big streamers dont need to worry about money, so they can feel safe
[0:48:23] TheGreenman: Because the comeback stream gets more views.
[0:48:23] freetownJoe: ddHuh
[0:48:29] pc2400: its only true if the streamer is big, if a small streamer got 48hours it would suck
[0:48:29] Tomchuu: how about ban forvere?  new streamers take their place.
[0:48:31] Cephyric: Didn't Poki call out react andies ages ago too? Pretty hypocritical
[0:48:35] DobbsjustDobbs: You can think DMCA is bullshit but it's the law and unless it changes not following it is detrimental to the platform
[0:48:44] German_LoCaD: Maybe put the fear into those content creator instead of rewarding them.
[0:48:45] qdazzarus: member when poki went hard after YT'rs because of them using her clips, I member
[0:48:48] aurice_heartly: yeah it really happens
[0:48:57] ReginaldXIV: Time to get banned CrungoSpin
[0:48:57] aurice_heartly: you get crazy publicity for being banned
[0:48:59] Mrshilka: bs or not DMCA is the law
[0:49:04] ansaron: @Cephyric It would have been hypocritical if she was doing it at the time. People can change their minds.
[0:49:08] Wildskunk: twitch should make it so they can continue to stream but can't touch money from subs / bits for X days
[0:49:08] jan_nil: just say the thing:  they get banned so they can take vacations because Twitch doesn’t offer paid leave @itmejp
[0:49:16] Gingerprimer: In the fight beetween DMCA law and twitch I am betting on the law every time
[0:49:20] aurice_heartly: CodeMiko got banned and she got the same thing
[0:49:31] mirautaj: should get banned more often
[0:49:31] Coffinsnail: DMCA should have like you said 3 day suspention, and no revenue from the 3 days prior from subs, bits, and prime subs, literally take money from them to wake them up
[0:49:33] Fenrick_Duskhowler: @itmeJP it will cause a huge exodus of creators from twitch that's why it' not a good idea
[0:49:34] duskps: @Wildskunk yea but then people will just donate directly
[0:49:35] steve87r: of course, it introduces you to a new audience
[0:49:38] imobaka: ppl were happy to get a break from zeke LUL
[0:49:45] BarryCarlyon: Even more so with streamerbans doin the free advertising when you ban starts/ends
[0:49:46] Cephyric: You can tell who hasn't had to protect their own copyrights before, based on the people that call DMCA bullshit LUL . The system is hugely flawed sure, but the system specifically does work in most cases. Abuse of DMCA is a different issue
[0:49:46] Wildskunk: @duskps some will. most wont
[0:49:51] HedgyV: @Wildskunk , that's already in place.  Streamers only get paid every 30 days.  It's a Financial reporting thing called Net-30.
[0:49:51] Sathias: @jan_nil They don't have a schedule enforced by twitch, they can not stream when ever they want.
[0:49:56] Mrshilka: plucky streamer fights twitch
[0:49:57] Tighron: @Wildskunk tha tmoney already is only pai dout  every 30/45 days anyway, so you have to straight up not pay it for it to have any effect
[0:49:58] JimWho: Yeah, the banned streamer becomes the hero ijpSHRUG
[0:50:01] Matzuka: I always wonder how long twitch will survive
[0:50:04] InternetPlumber: creators thinking they can just go to youtube and do the same thing are delusional
[0:50:06] Ezekiel_III: imobaka HOW DARE YOU?! zekePEPE
[0:50:12] BigBeardedAL: it's the law, then let's not care whether it's eithical or not....
[0:50:13] vashaun: we still dont know why the doc was banned
[0:50:16] jaxkmurphy: I also think content creators have made their viewers so anti dmca that even if a dmca claim is legit the viewers will still hate it and support their content creator @itmejp
[0:50:18] Notenoughcoffee: i didnt heard about pokimane for years.. but took one ban to see her name everywhere

[0:51:04] Lucifer222: public opinion won't matter when the suits start dropping
[0:51:04] 1TrueTyrant: I dont know, the whole nebulous threat of DMCA being enough justification for levels of punishments is just weird to me. But also Im not from the US or Europe so piracy to me has been a part of my life since I knew that the internet existed

[0:51:14] lews0rs: @DobbsjustDobbs DMCA is the law but most twitch streamers benefit from the current blindspot. JP could theoretically get a DMCA strike for his trailer time streams.
[0:51:15] BigBeardedAL: @dobbsjustdobbs it is when those copyright are controlled by companies and not people

[0:51:45] aznhai: my problem is cohh's solution to the system is harsher punishment? i cant disagree more; the ban follows twitch guidelines for # of offenses

[0:52:00] SyedHaroonAli: @NoorElBahrain ijpONO
[0:52:03] Cephyric: @Cephyric It's not though. Rights holders issue notices for infringement of their copyright. That's them saying they are willing to back this up in court. You can absolutely contest a takedown notice if you believe your content is fair use,, but you have to be willing to defend it in court
[0:52:04] Matzuka: I'm ot sure what cohh is sayong?
[0:52:06] PukiMan: it's so easy for twitch to fix their site. they should just be consistent with their rules.

[0:52:15] Lucifer222: because the sky spat on me
[0:52:16] BakinPacman: its purely attention of any kind can always be perceived as a either good or bad
[0:52:17] DobbsjustDobbs: I'm not saying I like DMCA, but unless there can be a movement to change the law, the platform has to abide by it. And these streamers poking the bear are hurting it for everyone else

[0:53:23] Hundisilm: those rules are great - you will get banned whenever
[0:53:33] 1TrueTyrant: Agreed, stronger punishments will do nothing for younger audiences, they will just find new ways around it. Its like hoping a teenager doesnt rebel, its just human nature

[1:05:32] PTviracaricas: @FrozanFlames exactly LUL
[1:05:33] Snoresalot: I wouldnt mind play to earn games
[1:05:35] TheGreenman: pay to earn is when you turn playing a game into a job.
[1:05:38] SlipCrit: @Hundisilm buying and selling skins like CS go basicly its fuckin dumb
[1:05:41] TheGreenman: play*
[1:05:41] Gynocopter: @Hundisilm people conflating value in products to be able to generate long term earnings
[1:05:41] InternetPlumber: a balanced response. lets see how the internet has taken it. oh god
[1:05:42] Scootouchard: Or be like Square Enix and say we don't care about our customers
[1:05:43] JaxRebel: i dont want it in games at all
[1:05:44] BakinPacman: they basically say it needs more research
[1:05:53] Mrshilka: Get out of here Stalker NODDERS
[1:05:54] pc2400: @mirautaj anyone who say no they lying until it is acceptable and profitable
[1:05:55] DoctorJohn: good, fuck NFTs
[1:05:58] Sonatta: no Sonic NFTS PepeHands
[1:06:02] bakavic: instead of collecting modelling trading cards in yakuza, you will now collect modelling nfts
[1:06:03] Zozamex: Get out of here NFTs
[1:06:06] Zrmi: Stalker will add them later after release.. 100% sure
[1:06:06] Gank4CE1: D:
[1:06:10] Matzuka: nfts oh boy
[1:06:15] Ruuno: they dont need nfts to do any of that
[1:06:16] DoctorJohn: they just see dollar signs
[1:06:18] Siggenlh: thats some large backlash if you can make a bunch of benjamins for a single ugly nft
[1:06:19] Mrshilka: @Sonatta Sonic nfts but its the furry porn NODDERS
[1:06:20] SlipCrit: those peopel dont pla ygames

[1:06:24] drinnja: https://clips.twitch.tv/FantasticCulturedSowRickroll-APi-97CPETBnyULX
[1:06:26] Hundisilm: The marketing person who came up with "Pay to Earn" needs to be hanged :)
[1:06:27] PukiMan: read how ieasy it's to destroy the nft system by shutting down opensea and laughed at people that purchased any
[1:06:28] middleagedavid: New technology that major corporations are already abusing
[1:06:33] Lucifer222: one of the many reasons im avoiding ubisoft
[1:06:35] BarryCarlyon: @Zrmi how? Stalkers initial NFT was "get your name and likeness in the game" can't really do that too much _after_ launch.
[1:06:40] Matzuka: I blame TF2
[1:06:41] Zrmi: @DoctorJohn thats not true
[1:06:42] Sonatta: @Mrshilka towLewd
[1:06:46] Cephyric: The cryprobros earning huge money off naive people want NFTs in everything
[1:06:47] FrozanFlames: @Hundisilm he was probably actually promoted. KEKW
[1:06:52] pacman7654: wtf do nfts have to do with games
[1:06:54] swordofrahl: NFTs are just the new scam. There is some use for digital artists, but most I've seen are complete scams
[1:06:55] PTviracaricas: i just don't understand what makes it a "new technology"
[1:06:56] cloudshots: NFT will happen. Greed is stronger than everything that is right.
[1:06:57] German_LoCaD: Hopefully saved Stalker 2. NFT thought out of their heads and back to the asshole it spawned from.
[1:06:58] yrvengalied: KEKW
[1:06:58] Heisuisui: KEKW
[1:06:59] WeeMr_Goodcat: how does JP green screen for DF? does he have a sheet he uses just for this, or is it just clever camera tricks?

[1:07:28] El_Zilcho22: i hope nobody checks it out
[1:07:30] middleagedavid: See? There's no coming back from this. They've sunk NFTs before they even got out of the gate
[1:07:31] Lucifer222: are they even a games company anymore?
[1:07:32] ReggX: Konami keeps digging
[1:07:36] DoctorJohn: @zeobishop NFTs use an enormous amount of energy to generate
[1:07:37] Cephyric: Konami are Konami, and Konami are the worst
[1:07:51] yrvengalied: if someone reaches that part in a game that was an NFT owned cant they claim that Video @itmeJP ?
[1:07:53] Lihapiiras: "Fuck Konami" - TotalBiscuit
[1:07:55] n1rri: I just don't get why we couldn't stick to what TF2, CS, DOTA, League with their buyable cosmetics are doing. Why do we have to do extra loopholes like NFT shit
[1:08:00] BarryCarlyon: @ZeoBishop DLC skins there are inifite of them. NFT's there is supposed to be a fixed number of them
[1:08:03] SFWildBill: look up WeNew if you want the nft cutting edge
[1:08:06] Sammonoske: Konami never got better lol. They just shut up for a while
[1:08:07] WayneG947: cough Blizzard cough

[1:08:17] PaxterRedwyne: Well Square at least has decent games
[1:08:24] Ciefon: like atari
[1:08:24] Mrshilka: Konami found out they can make money in other ways then panchinko machines
[1:08:24] LGNDRYNRG: OH WAIT IS THIS EPISODE 300??
[1:08:27] Liminaly: DF should have a betting pool on what Large games publisher gets it first in a large game , EA? Ubi? Bliz?
[1:08:29] BarryCarlyon: @lgndryrng 299
[1:08:30] Scientist__: @lgndryrng 299
[1:08:32] Darkaros: @n1rri " BabyRage I can't convert my Steam wallet money / skinned accounts back into real money"
[1:08:37] TheGreenman: NFTs are just the new lootboxes

[1:08:38] SlipCrit: @SenkoFluff theyve been out of the shitter for years FF14 made them MASSIVE again KEKW
[1:08:42] QuestFor420: its an EZ cash grab
[1:08:44] LGNDRYNRG: ty
[1:08:44] German_LoCaD: Prepare for the shitshow when Square is shoving NFTs in every Final Fantasy main franchise.
[1:08:46] Aerionoth: Squeenix had that problem when they almost sunk with FFXIV 1.0, now they forgot it...
[1:08:51] NinjaPandaEU: The devs still have that spark for the most part, but once you get big the MBAs take over.
[1:08:51] DoctorJohn: that there is exactly why companies are jumping on it. it's a cash grab. consumer loses.
[1:08:53] Matzuka: frre money Kreygasm
[1:09:00] Cephyric: Konami is the company that was already bastardizing all their IP into pachinko machines, so it makes sense that they're getting in on the NFT game
[1:09:00] kasded: YEP
[1:09:01] bakavic: @Liminaly ubisoft already has nft in ghost recon
[1:09:05] Mrshilka: will Microsoft say yes to NFTs though
[1:09:10] RlDennis: But how much would they lose in goodwill? If you sell a company. You do actually get paid for the goodwill of that company aswell
[1:09:11] SenkoFluff: @SlipCrit thats the thing with square they've been down so many times they needed ff to not go down
[1:09:11] Liminaly: @bakavic ouch
[1:09:11] German_LoCaD: I am out of every NFT suppored Product.

[1:09:29] TheGreenman: NFT horse armor
[1:09:30] Gynocopter: god no
[1:09:30] konvay: Sony CEO said they're for it? Or maybe that was personal and maybe that wasn't the gaming division
[1:09:34] JaxRebel: oof
[1:09:34] Klassicoops: Please Todd, no
[1:09:35] Siggenlh: nintendo are to stingent with their IP so they wont do it
[1:09:36] Airdus: i saw an interview of steve jobs saying that ppl making product make a company, once they're so big , their product is so well known, the power shift to marketing bc that's the ppl that generates more money and then the compagny loses their bond with their product
[1:09:38] Gliverz: droppef frames nft when?!
[1:09:38] BarryCarlyon: Gearbox/Borderlands gonna be next. Then Epic more fully.
[1:09:39] Myr_01: I'm just waiting for Star Citizen NFTs LUL
[1:09:39] mixel7: metal gear 35 year anniversary this year FeelsGoodMan Clap
[1:09:40] Lucavi43: if square puts NFTS on ff14, i quit
[1:09:40] Helix919: I still holding out SE NFT is going to be a PR thing, where they will "listen" and walk it back
[1:09:43] ZeoBishop: it is coming monkaW
[1:09:43] Sonatta: i'm surprise Valve hasn't announced a Steam NFT market yet
[1:09:50] RhodesToRome: @Siggenlh KEKLEO
[1:09:58] Hyluhnduh: monkaEyes online only

[1:09:59] Cavalier_UK: NFT of the show
[1:10:00] Monkeytrickz: the witcher season  3 nft
[1:10:00] GrateWhiteDope: Imagine NFT skins in league of legends and other games.
[1:10:01] SlipCrit: KEKW
[1:10:03] Hundisilm: I sort of like the concept on a very basic level for NFTs in games - the potential for abuse is too scary though
[1:10:04] woschdvendetta: PepeLaugh
[1:10:05] FrozanFlames: Square has its own conference so it is happening there LUL
[1:10:06] yrvengalied: PepeLaugh

[1:10:11] Cavalier_UK: most anticipated NFT
[1:10:12] BakinPacman: chad move
[1:10:13] Keyah: I don't think anybody would doubt Bethesda being Pro NFT, they're still cramming Skyrim down our throat. They don't care, they want money
[1:10:13] Purona: There wasnt an e3 last year though.
[1:10:15] BarryCarlyon: @Sonatta they don't need to they already have steam marketplace. They don't need to make it more complicated. And Steam already banned ALL blockchain based games
[1:10:16] PukiMan: @Darkaros isn't technically you can, by selling gifted games that you purchased using steam's wallet currency that you made from selling skins?
[1:10:17] Heisuisui: geoff likes to beat a dead horse
[1:10:19] taimou: @Sonatta valve banned nfts from steam tho
[1:10:21] Mrshilka: no days gone 2 PepeHands
[1:10:32] Siggenlh: games already have fake scarcity in much of their time/amount limited dlc bullshit
[1:10:36] Marc326: @Sonatta surprised how, didn't Valve ban any and all games with nft?
[1:10:38] ZeoBishop: bend
[1:10:40] vashaun: bend
[1:10:41] yrvengalied: Bend
[1:10:42] PrinceofTheUniverse: studio bend
[1:10:48] konvay: @Sonatta Steam has gone as far as banning blockchain/NFT from their platform, Epic then welcomed it. So I don't expect we'll see any of that, not anytime soon
[1:10:50] Monkeytrickz: @BarryCarlyon arent the steam tradingcards nft's in its own right?
[1:10:53] BarryCarlyon: @Darkaros Not really  as you _still_ can't convert that back to real money. Like you can with NFT's
[1:10:53] Darkaros: @Darkaros Shh that makes too much sense and is clearly much too difficult compared to selling receipts
[1:10:54] Matzuka: Valve banned nfts until their cut is guaranteed
[1:10:54] Siggenlh: dont EPIC already have nft stuff on their store
[1:10:58] German_LoCaD: Steam said no to NFT supported games on their platform, but then their are games with NFTs on Steam. MIR$4 etc
[1:11:06] Mrshilka: it was a dispointment onthe pos ps4
[1:11:17] El_Zilcho22: LUL

[1:11:21] Haeher: KEKW
[1:11:22] mephium: what? LUL
[1:11:25] BarryCarlyon: @Monkeytrickz You could argue that, but the steam marketplace makes it a SINGLE control point. Where as NFT"s have none. NFT"s generally only have a limited number of copies of a thin.
[1:11:34] Siggenlh: days gone had horrid pacing.
[1:11:36] Gank4CE1: KEKW
[1:11:40] MusenMouse: Foot in mouth
[1:11:43] RhodesToRome: Days Gone devs are always bitching about something
[1:11:47] cloudshots: but what the real number though
[1:11:50] Icemoth: I'd like to think Phil watches the show and the future of gaming is basically decided live here on Dropped Frames
[1:11:53] Helix919: I'm calling it; Nintendo will have the most NFT talk during their show. Nintendo Fun Times, or something that is cringe but no actually NFT.
[1:12:01] neuro_6: @RhodesToRome Nah its just the one guy
[1:12:01] ShockuhZuluu: @RhodesToRome NODDERS
[1:12:07] Matzuka: I'm never selling my Tulip bulbs

[1:12:14] SlipCrit: @RhodesToRome well mostly the lead dev whos gone now
[1:12:18] woschdvendetta: the days were indeed gone
[1:12:24] ShockuhZuluu: I cannot wait for whatever Ghosts 2 is!
[1:12:25] TheGreenman: It was a big open world zombie game... It's just that zombie games aren't as popular as they were 10 years ago
[1:12:29] ZeoBishop: psvr2
[1:12:30] Myr_01: PSVR2 Pog
[1:12:34] Monkeytrickz: @Monkeytrickz yeah, i get that, same as activision/blizzards wallets and the origin etc... i guess it's waitin for te day they allow blockchain traffic inbound and outbound to those systems.

[1:13:08] aurice_heartly: comes with a head vibration too lol
[1:13:14] StochasticDiscount: The Horizon devs didn't actually make the VR game though

[1:13:23] ZeoBishop: i may get that VR headset it would be my first

[1:13:37] kalTorakSF: COPIUM
[1:13:38] BarryCarlyon: PSVR is gonna work as it's a fixed hardware point. Less shit to go wrong with mixed hardware like PC
[1:13:38] aki_mattis: Alyx for PSVR2 would be so nice
[1:13:38] FrozanFlames: They also made FPS stuff before horizion so changing to a first person perspective could be smooth change for them hopefully.
[1:13:42] LGNDRYNRG: LOL
[1:13:42] BLOODYKNUKELZ: O man Cohhs gonna be disappointed lol

[1:14:20] Mega_R: You lost: you didn't Aloy fast enough
[1:14:25] Gingerprimer: @Mrshilka yeah I mainly meant public companies
[1:14:25] RhodesToRome: Why wouldn't Sony do better controllers? This shit is basically the Oculus.
[1:14:30] bjartensen: buttons KomodoHype
[1:14:34] Monkeytrickz: it's part tech demo and part interactive/action.

[1:14:47] ワフルデラ: @SiriusNick Senior World Designer of Horizon 2 said: "I didn’t work on it, but I promise you this will change what AAA means for VR." so I dunno

[1:14:51] yrvengalied: they called it " it will revolutionize the AAA VR games "
[1:14:55] Cephyric: Siggenlh Oh no the desk they showed was ridiculous. Do you remember when they announced their "modular" PC that had no hardware support? They put the same thing into a desk
[1:14:57] Siggenlh: the playstation are still lacking in power. hopefully it will lead to better optimized vr ports to pc. lower spec requirements

[1:17:24] its__fil: @Siggenlh you can look at it this way - ps4 had VR and that was woefully underpowered compared to PS5. So whatever VR comes out, sure it might not be as good as a top end PC but it'll still work
[1:17:28] BetaFlame00: 4 billion dollars.  If you can find it.
[1:17:31] CamberCYM: the eye tracking could be for the foveated rendering... instead of having fixed foveation like the Quest's have

[2:15:28] Riluske: @Dumt kotor 2 didn't really. They ran out of money and rushed everything
[2:15:29] philipov: Cohh-pium
[2:15:44] nimrickz: COPIUM
[2:15:58] bjartensen: easily
[2:16:03] izdouble: thats not a high bar\
[2:16:07] philipov: My favorite loporrit is Copingway
[2:16:08] ZeoBishop: NODDERS
[2:16:16] GGuts: The level design is fantastic in Mankind Divided.
[2:16:20] countmarcula: The ending felt like the ending to Chinatown. The conspiracy is way too big to do anything about. You just knocked down some pawns. The end. And that's actually kinda cool
[2:16:24] ar_farazon: The Ascent does cyberpunk so much better than Cyberpunk
[2:16:31] bjartensen: dyson hand dryer KomodoHype
[2:16:32] Siggenlh: ouff thats bad
[2:16:39] dreddreplicant: you can buy the game super cheap now

[2:16:43] SlipCrit: KEKW
[2:16:46] dreddreplicant: like 3 euros
[2:16:48] Lihapiiras: Worst part about this game is how much superior the Human Revolution is.
[2:17:01] countmarcula: @Lihapiiras Disagree
[2:17:06] hollysephiroth: thats not a lot for a game this big
[2:17:12] dreddreplicant: not only pr
[2:17:14] Sonatta: in the game when Tomb Raider sales were "disappointing" yet the highest they'd ever been
[2:17:16] leovic1: augment your preorder
[2:17:16] DagooX: SE pr probably
[2:17:19] leovic1: ijpNOPERS
[2:17:21] Siggenlh: the PR sunk the launch gamesales
[2:17:21] ZeoBishop: augment your preorder :)
[2:17:24] SlipCrit: so dont preorder?
[2:17:30] DagooX: knowing now that SE wants nft
[2:17:34] Supwizy: it was a ponzi scheme
[2:17:37] Jack_Peevey: SE said the same for the Tomb Raider reboot. It needed 3mil to be successful
[2:17:38] kazen01: the pr backlash
[2:17:41] Hemipheistos: GOOD !
[2:17:42] GGam3r: DX3 is gonna come with NFTs Kappa

[2:17:50] German_LoCaD: This augument your preorder turned me off.
[2:17:56] Siggenlh: the titles were also so similiar i felt likt it just was an expansion sized game.
[2:17:57] daumis1: Shouldnt pre order games in the first place
[2:18:04] pc2400: didn't it have bad PC port?
[2:18:07] ZeoBishop: go back ep 69 of DF to here about it Kappa
[2:18:10] Shapelessdnb: So is Mankind Divided the decent one or Human Revolution?
[2:18:21] GGuts: @Lihapiiras At least the technical and game play side in this game is much better than in HR. The graphics, game play, level design etc.
[2:18:21] Hundisilm: It was a good game though I think - I remember having fun with it
[2:18:22] CookieFiend_: "We dont pre-order videogames"
[2:18:24] philipov: human revolution is the decent one @Shapelessdnb
[2:18:26] Gliverz: maybe it didnt have an ending because not enough people preordered it, hmm?
[2:18:27] rarelybroken: I remember totalbiscuit talking about this in a very VERY negative way with the preorders
[2:18:32] Siggenlh: so about that mobile game...
[2:18:47] DagooX: also they did a tablet version that noone asked for KEKW
[2:18:48] FrozanFlames: LUL fuck square goddamn
[2:18:58] pc2400: Microsoft should buy it and give it to Arkane
[2:18:59] GGuts: @Lihapiiras Also the open-world part is much more alive and intriguing.
[2:19:00] KatjeMauw: EA with so many game series done that, make shit choices blame the people for not buying them
[2:19:02] Shapelessdnb: @philipov Ah thank you!
[2:19:02] kazen01: buying levels
[2:19:03] dreddreplicant: @Shapelessdnb they are both ok. good but with issues
[2:19:08] Siggenlh: i think i treid the mobile game on pc. it was so bad.
[2:19:19] mirautaj: cohhEvil Good
[2:19:27] ZeoBishop: is the store still up?
[2:19:37] thesestrangenotions: that story reminded me of hearing how EA affected ME:A and Anthem development
[2:19:40] Tyronin: i remember you all talking about it
[2:19:40] countmarcula: @Shapelessdnb They're both great. Most people will probably tell you HR is the better one but I actually liked MD more.
[2:19:40] GGuts: @Lihapiiras And the side quests are much better as well. But that's where it ends.
[2:19:48] ReggX: 2016
[2:19:48] bjartensen: JP should play DE:HR
[2:19:53] dreddreplicant: 2016

[2:19:57] mirautaj: 2016
[2:19:57] JujuPwns: 2016
[2:20:04] philipov: @bjartensen Deus Ex: Human Resources
[2:20:14] Gingerprimer: @Stalker2400 port was not amazing but not bad. Deus ex also has tons off bonus eye candy that you need a great/amazing pc to run and ppl maxed out the game on their at the time good pcs and ran inton problems
[2:20:22] bjartensen: @philipov KEKW
[2:20:32] Shapelessdnb: Ty chat PridePog because I just found HR sitting in my library
[2:20:44] SlipCrit: origins sdcl is honestly fiewn its just skins
[2:20:48] SlipCrit: dlc*
[2:20:51] pc2400: Assasin's Creed had mtx before Origins
[2:20:55] Gank4CE1: GotG was a lot of fun
[2:21:09] Supwizy: GotG is also a complete package for 1 price
[2:21:13] bjartensen: DE:HR first
[2:21:29] Hemipheistos: i think the MTX in AC:Origin and Odyssey are very subtile as an cosmetic option. It did not bother me at all.
[2:21:38] DagooX: director's cut is nice with devs commentating under it
[2:21:50] ReggX: Mankind Divided's gameplay is so good.
[2:21:51] Stickster42: dxmd will crash more then cyberpunk does
[2:22:00] pc2400: @Hemipheistos its not about bothering you, they shouldn't be there in a singleplayer experience
[2:22:05] SlipCrit: the weird thing with origins is trhe weapons you can buy have stats which SEEMS bad but they are the same stats as every other weapon and htey just scale with your level
[2:22:08] philipov: Mankind Divided is a "Buy it on sale" game
[2:22:35] countmarcula: MD has a TON of little clues / lore / side stuff to explore and discover, Prague actually felt alive and i loved it for that
[2:22:46] SoiledWig: @Stickster42 i guess it depends on what you're playing it on. i played DX:MD five times through and i never had a crash
[2:22:47] ftgander: I played through Human Revolution because a friend wouldn’t shut up about how great it was. So I beat the whole thing, found it incredibly boring tbh
[2:22:54] zerohour_88: they will have a lot more money when the NFTs hit KEKW

I get that people enjoyed it, so I’m not saying its a bad game, just one of those games I couldn’t personally enjoy that everyone loves

[3:37:51] afreak10: get ur item
[3:39:07] Killian_Hart: yep, this is yorick
[3:39:10] afreak10: i think the teleport better than ignite no ?
[3:39:19] s_k_o_m: G'day
[3:39:25] LazyNekos: Well also kinda delayed the back too much
[3:39:31] Killian_Hart: depends. teleport is great top against split pushers
[3:39:34] UFOanticipatorMAN: tp is nerfed now, so i guess ignite is better
[3:39:37] afreak10: gj
[3:39:39] demigod791: hey JP
[3:39:53] Natjen8: JP gaming!
[3:40:02] AdrenALI_N: Yorrick looks pretty weak from an outsiders perspective but I guess they got some secrets
[3:40:03] afreak10: ignite ftw
[3:40:03] Priithee: hows irelia goin
[3:40:14] roflrabbit: JP getting into the blade dancing grove BloodTrail
[3:40:18] Insigmada: Not only did he take you gold he also took your heals lol
[3:40:31] Herr_Panzar: @UFOanticipatorMAN is the cd even longer now, or how can they nerf  tp?
[3:40:33] Natjen8: i definitely starting to see more confident plays
[3:40:34] Sweet_Threat: graves fucked you
[3:40:35] Natjen8: which is great
[3:40:48] Rezzak77: that death would've tilted me more cause you might not have died if you coulda dashed on that wave at all lol
[3:41:02] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @afreak10 Ignite is better the tp when you have no faith in your team or (especially your jg) basically when you take ignite you are saying the rest of your team suck so bad you have to win it by yourself
[3:41:10] Natjen8: yeah rift herald aggro range is ridic
[3:42:02] afreak10: what indeed
[3:42:08] Darkaros: YAPPP Father. Mother. Cyan. Purple. Milkmaid. Plunger.

[3:43:48] TDotTerror: Father. Mother. Dasher. Dancer. Prancer. Vixen.
[3:44:10] KonikMiejski: yes, you can also not recast to pop second one on yourself
[3:44:27] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @afreak10  when you don't take tp you have can't tp to help your team. Ignite also falls off. So you are saying I am going to win early game and then try to win the game on my own
[3:45:20] SpawnOnMe: hot damn
[3:45:25] Baske_T: you are lvl 14, so you're up on him still
[3:45:36] Gliverz: That swain talking about team fights and to stop commit suicide... lol :D
[3:45:38] afreak10: Irelia is a gank hero , so if u TP other lanes and kill it helps the push in my opinion
[3:45:51] Nurama: @Baske_T Yeah but jp is always good :)
[3:46:00] Xinder88: Swain dies in a place he shouldn't have been solo, with no team anywhere near, complains about no one being there to teamfight and fighting 1v3....wut?
[3:46:19] afreak10: nice arrow
[3:46:20] SamMFJackson: oh shit, leeagueee time!
[3:46:33] Killian_Hart: @Xinder88 that's bronze for ya

[3:46:55] BrokenModem: @Killian_Hart Thats not just bronze, thats everywhere.
[3:46:59] Rdei: If you can dodge his stun then its free
[3:47:10] Tannrd: i think swain is playing fully zoomed in
[3:47:24] asbolution_: Hello chat, hope you're all well o/
[3:47:43] afreak10: he didn't count on u to block it
[3:47:43] johnfive21: Graves and Swain are Pepega
[3:47:52] Xinder88: @Tannrd Swain playing in VR
[3:48:55] Convectt: You do a lot of dmg tho
[3:48:56] KAHVITEK: That was a sick stun
[3:49:01] aznhai: jp is cracked
[3:49:08] Barba06: watching this makes me want to play Irelia
[3:49:29] sunflower204: assuming graves a good player, feeding him might be good
[3:49:30] AN71V1RU5: if someone takes all the kills, then they better carry
[3:49:47] Tannrd: your best bet may to be just split and hope your team can hold
[3:49:59] i_revarm: @itmeJP you inspired  me  to try Irelia on my alt  account  only  to get matched  up vs high diamond one tricks, it  did not  go  well and im upset about it! KEKW
[3:50:17] Variandra: @itmeJP ashe ulted backwards
[3:50:20] johnfive21: your team has 0 engage sadly
[3:50:27] sunflower204: probably could've shutdown xerath there
[3:50:42] AN71V1RU5: love this ashe flaming when she fed tf out of their botlane and jungle
[3:51:00] afreak10: more like swain feed
[3:51:05] FunFaceTV: yeah, graves kinda ksing and doing nothing productive with his lead...sad
[3:51:09] asbolution_: hol up who let this graves bot into your game of leagur
[3:51:59] afreak10: dumb team
[3:52:15] Jukettaja: Well you got Baron
[3:52:19] Pucci2001: why isnt your team pushing mid with 4 dead lol?
[3:52:21] Convectt: kinda worked out, no snipe on the baron
[3:52:32] Jukettaja: You usually reset after baron
[3:52:34] eggzoverxezx: its a game chat. relax
[3:52:35] Kalbatronas: i see thsi is bronze for a reason
[3:52:40] Jukettaja: Because the fight took a lot of your abilities
[3:52:46] Jukettaja: And you have gold to spend
[3:52:55] Tannrd: if you had ign and ult i think you win hard was unlucky timing
[3:53:00] Pucci2001: it was a free tower, nobody to stop you from taking it with baron minions to boot
[3:53:00] Insigmada: it looked like you won before it became a ninja 2v1
[3:53:00] i_revarm: spirit  visage for more  healing and some  mr is  not bad
[3:53:06] Pucci2001: then you reset and push another lane

[4:14:45] hitbox_royal_rabbit: bot seems strong
[4:14:51] CocoScruff: if she was there like 10 sec sooner you would have gotten away
[4:14:57] afreak10: most death's from top
[4:14:58] 2x0k: yeah hang in there, plenty of time
[4:15:01] dextros13: if Diana camps bot its easy win
[4:15:05] OhTenGeneral: Little Ru though
[4:15:06] Insigmada: Not little rue cohhFeels
[4:15:08] SamMFJackson: irelia might be awesome to play, but holy moly her voice line spams are annoying, lol
[4:15:12] roflrabbit: team doing fine
[4:15:14] dextros13: coxJam
[4:15:15] vpopeprohladno: PepoChamp
[4:15:17] Darkaros: YAPPP Mother. Father. Gamba. Is. Up.
[4:15:18] CipansR_Ayaya: Little Ru Sadge
[4:15:20] AKraftyBasterd: bronzeF
[4:15:30] Tornados_: Bad part, only you have died mostly, good part is only have to died and you're up two lanes
[4:15:47] hitbox_royal_rabbit: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3
[4:15:59] Fr0zenshock: diana should stay top a bit more..
[4:16:21] Tengtalks: @Josehamm No she shouldn't. Ganking a losing lane is not worth it.
[4:16:31] GT_JamesATL: Relying on Diana to help in any role is risky.
[4:16:42] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/DroppedFrames/status/1480236903739842566
[4:16:43] os_nexus: yeah mid or bot should try and swap with you
[4:16:48] hitbox_royal_rabbit: little does she know the edgy samurai in bottom lane is clearly the main character.
[4:16:52] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks helps get some pressure off him and so he can farm..
[4:16:56] Bojack_The_Horseman: KEKW
[4:17:05] afreak10: KEKW
[4:17:12] FrozanFlames: KEKW
[4:17:27] Tornados_: ask if you can swap with bot
[4:17:34] MattiaV96: "ya"
[4:17:35] STNbond: he already did
[4:17:35] Nurama: @Tornados_ he did
[4:17:36] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks just me tho.
[4:17:41] FunFaceTV: forgot to buy
[4:17:43] Tornados_: RIP ;<
[4:17:50] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: there are tones of bad jg playing today
[4:18:08] apothecary_asbjorn: Classic League
[4:18:11] DagooX: go jungle Kappa
[4:18:56] Tengtalks: @Josehamm Still.. She should focus most of her time on the lanes she can easily gank. Low elo always flips out if they lose a lane and the jungler doesn't gank. He should just farm what he can. and scale late.
[4:19:28] OhTenGeneral: Little Rue D:
[4:19:56] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks i mean also, if your top lane is not doing hot.. you should try and gank...
[4:20:16] Kalbatronas: sadly taht dosent work taht way
[4:20:26] afreak10: some money
[4:20:34] blastboys123: my arguement is better because of my dots......
[4:20:42] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks leaving them hanging isnt great also..
[4:20:43] Kalbatronas: of the lane is lossing to a 1v1 it a high chance it wont help much
[4:21:14] Tengtalks: @Josehamm Ganking a losing lane is just not the way to compensate for a lane losing. You only extend the lead. Seeing as they can probably not even 2v1 him.
[4:21:16] Nurama: @Kalbatronas One kill depending on how much it denies can change literally everything
[4:21:31] Caerbae: yeah right kalba, better just let them keep losing and report for feeding right? rooDerp
[4:21:33] Kalbatronas: well unless he scales then yeh but if he is even bad then heck its jsut a waset
[4:21:34] Nurama: @tengtalks diana is fed here she can easilhy help
[4:22:01] Tengtalks: @Nurama I was talking about the laning phase. Not the mid game.
[4:22:05] blastboys123: shes fed because she was everywhere else right
[4:22:12] Kalbatronas: @Caerbae i literaly stoped lossing so many games cose i staretd fokusign good lanes
[4:22:28] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks so what youre saying is.. just leave him alone and let him die?
[4:22:38] Nurama: Also sometimes you do need to stop the bleeding, even just showing can allow a lane reset. or as asked lane swapping can really help
[4:22:42] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:23:10] 7_r_3_v_0_r: i should of been a garen main widepeepoSad
[4:23:12] dextros13: bot be carrying
[4:23:13] afreak10: nice
[4:23:13] DrYaguar: Pog Yone
[4:23:18] Bojack_The_Horseman: i ban yone every game KEKW
[4:23:21] Caerbae: yone is perfectly balanced. Truly a 200 year masterpiece
[4:23:24] Tengtalks: @Josehamm No I'm saying the losing lane should focus on staying in EXP range and farm when it's safe. That way the jungler can extend the lead on other lanes and win the game. Instead of waste time on a losing lane.
[4:23:32] hollysephiroth: damn you JP those streams are making me want to play this toxic game
[4:23:36] KAHVITEK: Swain is also huge it seems

[4:23:51] Barba06: why are her voice lines so long LUL
[4:23:54] ShrowdArrow: does the w block his ult?
[4:23:58] OhTenGeneral: Poor Little Rue
[4:24:15] chowdubs: @OhTenGeneral RIP
[4:24:18] hitbox_royal_rabbit: Damn Lil Rue, worst sound cloud rapper out there
[4:24:18] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks yeah.. easier said than done.. leaving them alone and letting the enemy keep the lead and come up more and more.. thats also terrible.
[4:24:22] hitbox_royal_rabbit: he deserved it
[4:24:23] CipansR_Ayaya: KEKW
[4:24:28] Sonnung: I genuinely think the shield on his W is just too much.
[4:24:42] chowdubs: You think he had a crutch? Like little timmy?
[4:24:54] Sonnung: There's no reason to give him so much survivability plus a shield on a single ability.
[4:25:01] Tengtalks: @Josehamm No it's actually very easy to say. 1 lost lane and 2 fed lanes is better than 2 lost lanes and 1 semi decent lane since you babysat top all laning phase.
[4:25:16] Caerbae: Garen Q
[4:25:17] dextros13: garen q
[4:25:19] afreak10: Garen
[4:25:19] Barba06: garen q yeah
[4:25:20] FunFaceTV: gaen q
[4:25:20] KariTelDell: Yep
[4:25:21] sunflower204: garen Q
[4:25:23] Shoaron: Garen Q silences
[4:25:39] CipansR_Ayaya: Garen Q
[4:25:44] SoulCrusher842: Brand has a stun too
[4:25:48] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks yeah but in this instance the other lanes were doing fine... so you can sacrifice the other two lanes to go up top and help.
[4:25:56] uui23: it was the garen q
[4:25:59] CipansR_Ayaya: was it ?
[4:26:00] Nurama: brand didnt do any dmg to you
[4:26:01] Notenoughcoffee: NODDERS
[4:26:05] apothecary_asbjorn: you ever look at the Garen mains subreddit? It's toxic.
[4:26:07] AnorienNightwish: Garen Q modCheck
[4:26:07] CipansR_Ayaya: NODDERS
[4:26:08] jmj1987: Garen D KEKW
[4:26:08] GameOnlyNoTalk: any garen q'ers in chat
[4:26:09] sunflower204: he can cancel his spin mid way and q immediately
[4:26:18] Insigmada: Lol jp I was watching some pro-lol streamer this morning and people where giving him advice. FailFish
[4:26:20] CocoScruff: it was the long D of the enemy
[4:26:23] Archangel3003: Chat, JP has recently played Garen a bunch so he knows.
[4:26:26] Tengtalks: @Josehamm I'm going to stop this conversation. You clearly are not playing this game on a semi decent rank and explaining basic principles to someone that doesn't care to listen is pointless. Have a great evening.
[4:26:35] CipansR_Ayaya: @Insigmada LUL
[4:26:43] SoulCrusher842: JP do you know Garen can silence Kappa thanks chat Kappa
[4:27:01] AnorienNightwish: @Insigmada Think JP tweeted about Bergstein(?) getting advice from chat, a while ago or something
[4:27:09] sunflower204: @Archangel3003 he doesn't seem to know garen's E can be canceled mid spin though.
[4:27:13] DrYaguar: KEKW
[4:27:16] DagooX: wow targeted
[4:27:17] dextros13: @josehamm best way to win as jungle is pick the winning lane and camp it
[4:27:20] roflrabbit: so sneaky
[4:27:20] chowdubs: yone like PC
[4:27:25] Caerbae: Diana is finally top rooGlue
[4:27:32] xPhire: kaiyoDead
[4:27:34] SoulCrusher842: Garen falls off late game at least
[4:27:34] CipansR_Ayaya: Hello modCheck
[4:27:35] SmoothAssKiwi: every bush has a garen
[4:27:35] SlimmieP: LOL
[4:27:47] chowdubs: yone is trolling
[4:28:00] sunflower204: yone and irelia's late game is way stronger than garen's
[4:28:05] Nurama: bush garen :D
[4:28:09] Fr0zenshock: @dextros13 no its not.. the jungle should be helping lanes that arent doing as well.. help them push off the champ/s so your team is to catch up.. but whatever.
[4:28:11] Luke90toko: I feel like they have a group chat and you're not part of it...
[4:28:35] CipansR_Ayaya: OMEGALUL
[4:28:35] afreak10: LUL
[4:28:37] DrYaguar: LUL
[4:28:38] Nurama: The fact garen is ignite tp and wasnt ganked repeatedly is a joke
[4:28:40] DagooX: KEKW
[4:28:40] Tengtalks: @Josehamm That's completely false.

[4:28:52] Fr0zenshock: @tengtalks i thought you were done with this conversation?
[4:28:56] ワフルデラ: Pog Caster JP is back
[4:29:01] jmj1987: coxJam
[4:29:02] Proph89: Garen when he sees the top tower under attack: furryRun
[4:29:17] notlongtillDawn: I'd watch pro salt cast. That sounds entertaining lol
[4:29:21] Debuggingfool: A caster that gets more and more frustrated as a game goes on would actually be pretty funny to watch.
[4:29:29] Tengtalks: @Josehamm O you are that kinda guy. XD I should have expected as much. Clearly you are a high ranking player that can give great advice.
[4:29:29] SoulCrusher842: 👏
[4:29:40] afreak10: MYAAA ijpDOGSLIDE

[4:30:02] Fiendmaw: Are you enjoying Irelia JP?
[4:30:04] GrievAY: @josehamm you camp the winning lanes, get them more and more kills. That has been the get go since I started in s2.
[4:30:07] Insigmada: tengtalks yes cause casters are currently playing the game they cast ijpHMM
[4:30:08] Darkaros: Hmm Stop engaging each other in conversation if you resort to ad-hominems.
[4:30:14] Barba06: @tengtalks @Josehamm I think both of you should just stop
[4:30:16] afreak10: omg
[4:30:22] Rizveld: HahaThisisfine
[4:30:24] SoulCrusher842: Ammu had a easy steal
[4:30:25] Shoaron: why are they doing Baron?? Hmm
[4:30:31] Archangel3003: @sunflower204 Garen has usually killed him before he can do anything about it but he probably does, having played him.
[4:30:37] SoulCrusher842: aoe stun and ez snipe
[4:30:40] SmoothAssKiwi: yeah baron against amumu is pretty dumb
[4:31:01] blastboys123: all you need to do is appeal to an authority
[4:31:08] Kyrvix: Amumu only got it because people were still attacking Baron instead of Amumu first
[4:31:23] Fr0zenshock: @Barba06 i was good. people just kept talking to me after teng said they were done with the convo
[4:31:39] sunflower204: @Archangel3003 I saw him play Garen, he never cancels his E even when he E'd by mistake, he also never uses Q auto reset.
[4:31:42] robertoredd: jp is now an irelia main... oh how the mighty have fallen

[4:32:40] SoulCrusher842: Push that lane hard
[4:32:45] DrYaguar: Swain support is a thing
[4:32:46] Tideshaper: @Ryuenjin it's ben a thing for a while
[4:32:47] Nurama: @Ryuenjin been a thing since his rework
[4:32:49] blastboys123: its been a thing and maybe now its like a third of the thing it was but still somewhat at hing
[4:33:21] afreak10: yikes
[4:33:28] Fiendmaw: 3v5....
[4:33:38] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW just had a kat tell my team not to end because she wants 20 kills before we win toxic piece of shit

[4:34:15] SmoothAssKiwi: 10/2 jungle doesnt have soul control? weird
[4:34:29] The_Faceless_Void: @robertoredd so I ended her game meanwhile the enemy team ended her KEKW
[4:34:51] Archangel3003: @sunflower204 I mean why cancel E, you spin to win. Well he's new to Garen so maybe doesn't know about the Q. Just let him play/learn
[4:34:53] keogg: Diana has the sigma grindset
[4:35:04] FunFaceTV: no one has void staff for garen....thats really bad
[4:35:14] robertoredd: @The_Faceless_Void nice! as you should

[4:48:39] Runforyerlives: @BaronVonScufflebutt u.gg feels like it doesn't have that many windows and really lightweight compared to poro
[4:48:43] GGuts: I told myself "You only play to improve your own skills, not to win!" and then proceed to rage anyway KEKW
[4:48:49] Fiendmaw: That's why I quit these games,consistency is only rewarded over hundreds of games

[4:49:49] itmeBOT: JP plays a lot of: Tahm Kench, Kayle, Mundo, Trist, MF; and some of: Teemo, Ashe
[4:50:02] Sweet_Threat: if you get into the mindset of splitting damage on creeps to proc Q in succession, could be good
[4:50:11] Fiendmaw: Honestly isn't Trynd kinda busted at low levels?
[4:50:13] GGuts: @itmeJP If you lose your own champion in fights try colorblind mode. Basically all pros play with it on.

[4:50:56] Killian_Hart: green and red becomes blue and yellow
[4:50:57] Big_Headed_Gamer: just makes your hp yellow itmeJP
[4:50:59] GGuts: It makes your champions HP bar golden, is the main thing
[4:51:02] Killian_Hart: its really easy to see
[4:51:04] Cellonious: Your healthbar turns to yellow
[4:51:07] teffy42: it changes health bar colors and some abilities
[4:51:14] StarPogPlatinum: it's way better
[4:51:15] Big_Headed_Gamer: it does help a lot though
[4:51:18] DaWasabiHD: It makes your health bar Yellow, and then your teammates and enemies healthbars easier to not get lost in.
[4:51:23] jmj1987: colorblind mode reduces negative emotions

[4:54:35] DaWasabiHD: One of the things you can abuse in this matchup is surprising extra burst from your E stun.

[5:04:43] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Big_Headed_Gamer SeemsGood
[5:04:45] Souzen300: does mark still apply if the E stun is blocked by Mundo's passive?
[5:04:48] BenjaminGankling: I wish this game had romance FeelsBadMan
[5:05:21] Darkaros: Hmm Sounds like you need to visit this website involving epals
[5:05:22] Mousxca: @Souzen300 it should

[5:07:02] ArcaneLight: the what now?
[5:07:08] Prrophett: that range for that move is too far imo
[5:07:12] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[5:07:16] Caerbae: hitboxes in LoL? *laughs in Xerath*
[5:07:40] psychic_ward: making fettucine with Marinara sauce. ijpNOM
[5:07:41] Bloodscry: @jp league is a 2D game u need to aim for peoples feet
[5:07:48] itz_just_camel: now you od
[5:08:00] Faintlich: HOLY SHIT LOL
[5:08:05] Uniqueabout: KEKW
[5:08:09] itz_just_camel: what just happened!?
[5:08:14] uui23: wow what is vi items?
[5:08:15] Last_Pegasus: hi @itmejp hi @chat. how is everyone doing? how is the salt level today?
[5:08:19] Darkaros: oh ya PepeLaugh I forgot that Dota has another dimension over League, literally
[5:08:20] OhTenGeneral: Vi'
[5:08:24] a6314: 9 kill VI
[5:08:27] OhTenGeneral: Vi is a teensy bit strong right now
[5:08:32] Kyrvix: a lot of the damage could've been mitigated with W
[5:08:34] KAHVITEK: Rolling in gold
[5:08:37] Souzen300: @itmeJP spacebar?  You mean for the refocus?  I think you could just hit "Y" and it'll autolock the camera on you as a toggle.  Its Y by default
[5:08:39] Airdor: :O
[5:08:45] uui23: oh yeah with those yeah I expected that amount of damage
[5:08:56] Faintlich: @Souzen300 locked camera is unplyable alkDX
[5:08:58] WabbitHatter: vi was also 1 of my fav chars. sooo underestimated and then she just pops you
[5:08:59] garry_leonard: I'd say your doing a great job. You just gotta be less spammy with your Q, and save minions for mobility and healing during fights.
[5:09:01] Miros__: @SoulCrusher842 yeah, but perma-follow-cam is fucking dreadful..
[5:09:09] Karamor: @Darkaros sadly the league map actually has distortion for elevation in some places, fucking up skill shots without any actual benefit for play
[5:09:10] FluentZap: @Souzen300 yeah I keep that off also
[5:09:23] Souzen300: @Souzen300 its very sueful for dash heavy high movement champs...  I toggle it on off for Diana
[5:09:35] Darkaros: We're 16-16, with a fed Vi and Irelia, who'll win MmmHmm
[5:09:36] Faintlich: i just hold space then let go
[5:09:36] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Last_Pegasus careful, he started banning people already. PepeLaugh
[5:09:42] Souzen300: Irelia is like Diana but on crack with her dashes
[5:09:42] FluentZap: @Souzen300 I get lost sometime also though
[5:09:43] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[5:09:47] psychic_ward: sodium levels have been rising.....
[5:10:09] Runforyerlives: Love buying Serpent's Fang against VI
[5:10:21] Runforyerlives: but she is a monster with that cc
[5:10:22] Big_Headed_Gamer: vi's got a nice kit. good CC and arm shred passive.
[5:10:23] KAHVITEK: She has big fists tho
[5:10:24] Last_Pegasus: @big_headed_gamer  I'll be mindfully of that
[5:10:26] DaronGreax: She is just super up
[5:10:26] Souzen300: Her ult is the "You no play" button
[5:10:36] Darkaros: She's up to 10 kills monkaS
[5:10:40] GGuts: It's the Arcane buff NODDERS
[5:10:55] garry_leonard: You can beat VI 1 on 1 if you are in a enemy minion wave where you can far up your passive, and heal during the fight.
[5:10:59] Vyyle: Should it not be 1-1?
[5:11:02] Karamor: hmm, not sure, but does irelia full build outscale vi again?
[5:11:13] GGuts: yes
[5:11:13] itz_just_camel: nice
[5:11:20] Darkaros: ya the score on the camera is outdated. JP is busy
[5:11:21] i_revarm: with  deaths  dance its  easyvs  vi
[5:11:22] WantedOne: lulu baited mundo out of jynx ult lol
[5:11:23] Nurama: Trynd was ulted
[5:11:30] BaosilisK: YAPP
[5:11:37] Souzen300: @Karamor uh, I think.  Irelia has a lot of healing where as Vi doesn't just relays on passive shields
[5:11:54] i_revarm: jp can fuck vi when he  has  shieldbow  and gets  dd
[5:11:55] garry_leonard: @Karamor Irellia outplays and power comes from her Q and surfing the enemy minion wave during fights. She excels 1 vs 1 in the middle of a enemy minion wave.
[5:11:57] Vyyle: ok Darkaros, cheers.
[5:11:59] KAHVITEK: Dragon pit fight soon monkaW
[5:12:01] ワフルデラ: Cast Strippin's games as a tryout KEKW
[5:12:01] Souzen300: but this fed of a Vi is a scary thing
[5:12:07] Convectt: Vex is way deep
[5:12:10] Kyrvix: He can still beat Vi, it's close but it's winnable by using ult earlier with the Q reset
[5:12:41] SirMopy: 4v5 not fightable
[5:12:42] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[5:12:49] Karamor: corki does stupid burst, kinda crazy how unpopular he seems at the moent
[5:12:52] Big_Headed_Gamer: this is a wait for late game scale
[5:12:52] SoulCrusher842: They have like two hefty tanks lol
[5:12:56] Big_Headed_Gamer: and by scale i mean jinx
[5:13:04] Runforyerlives: These league skins. Thought that was bard until he threw that sapling.
[5:13:04] Big_Headed_Gamer: well and irelia
[5:13:09] KAHVITEK: Clap
[5:13:22] DagooX: D: Jinx killed Vi
[5:13:25] azuumo: hello everyone. hope you are all doing amazing.
[5:13:31] itz_just_camel: i know nothing about league but is that just a bad matchup or what?
[5:13:31] Airdor: coxManleee
[5:13:33] Big_Headed_Gamer: peepoHey
[5:13:34] Karamor: @Souzen300 good point, but vi knockback, knockup locks you down a lot
[5:13:41] Caerbae: I suppose the anti-shield daggerthing might work vs their comp
[5:13:50] Slade1760: Oooooo playing Irelia now? @itmeJP
[5:13:50] BaosilisK: doogHi stripHi
[5:13:55] ritchie313: i might just starrt paying support yummi and go take a nap during games cuz its coinflip either way
[5:13:58] itz_just_camel: ah so just overleveled
[5:14:05] Runforyerlives: @Caerbae Serpent's Fang
[5:14:07] azuumo: since JP started streaming lol i can finally watch a streamer who is close to my elo cohhSip

[5:14:21] Darkaros: BaosilisK stripHi
[5:14:23] i_revarm: just lucky is  guess KEKW
[5:14:25] psychic_ward: watching this team a few minutes ago made ne think to shred some cheese for my pasta.
[5:14:29] DagooX: Wowee dogs doing dog things
[5:14:30] iUncouth: powerful snoot
[5:14:33] Convectt: He smells the elevation of the food
[5:14:35] Souzen300: @Karamor yeah, it really depends where the fight happens though.  If its in the minion wave?  Goes to Irelia.  In River around nothing?  Becomes more about pure timing...  But Vi can .1 sec charge her q so dodging it becomes harder
[5:14:38] a6314: emiZoom oh

[5:15:42] LegendsOfBobby: im here for title
[5:15:44] azuumo: what was that corki thinking?
[5:15:53] Karamor: @Souzen300 what build?

[5:16:10] Karamor: saved
[5:16:11] DagooX: POGGERS
[5:16:13] Souzen300: @Karamor The Ravenous + Luden's + Manamune build
[5:16:14] Darkaros: Clap
[5:16:16] azuumo: what is vi's build? that tanky build wi th lethal tempo?
[5:16:18] Airdor: :O coxManleee
[5:16:19] The_Faceless_Void: SPEEDERS  GO TEAM GO
[5:16:20] BenjaminGankling: You sacrificed for the team POGGERS
[5:16:24] Big_Headed_Gamer: damn vi's kda finally got to her mental
[5:16:28] Souzen300: rockets proc Ravenous...  its insane
[5:16:29] Big_Headed_Gamer: that was a greedy dive
[5:16:31] Karamor: @Souzen300 hydra and luden's?
[5:16:40] Souzen300: yeah
[5:16:42] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/DroppedFrames/status/1480236903739842566
[5:16:43] Griddlez: vi does fall off I think, at least she did 10 seasons ago
[5:16:44] Karamor: weird
[5:17:00] Darkaros: Mundo with the "walk in because otherwise my parents will yell at me for not even trying" play
[5:17:00] Insigmada: lol 10 season ago xD
[5:17:07] Boonia: did mundo flash in tot kill tryn and forget abour his ult
[5:17:12] Souzen300: @Griddlez she falls off about as much as WW does...  Their Ults keep them relevant imo...  A good Ult can turn a teamfight
[5:17:13] KAHVITEK: KEKW @Darkaros
[5:17:13] GGuts: KEKW
[5:17:13] Nurama: @Boonia sounds like league
[5:17:14] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Griddlez yeah she is at her peak. that's why i said before they just need to let irelia and jinx scale.
[5:18:03] Big_Headed_Gamer: lol
[5:18:10] Karamor: @Souzen300 hmm, ww plateaus harder I think, if a game goes really late I'm tempted to switch to tank ww
[5:18:13] Big_Headed_Gamer: mountain soul on Vi
[5:18:15] Big_Headed_Gamer: monkaEyes
[5:18:18] DrYaguar: KEKW
[5:18:23] azuumo: afk trynda cohhS
[5:18:28] azuumo: cohhM
[5:18:30] Souzen300: @Karamor yeah you just become a CC bot
[5:18:34] Karamor: mountain soul on anyone is tough
[5:18:37] PangurBanTheCat: 4v5 with baron and trynd walks away... what
[5:18:47] Karamor: @Souzen300 pretty good CC with the E though
[5:18:49] PenguinLore: just ult
[5:18:55] DrYaguar: what is that vi doing
[5:18:56] Big_Headed_Gamer: come on jinx get your shit together
[5:19:03] Convectt: they are overextending a lot
[5:19:19] Souzen300: @Karamor yup, but still a CC bot in the late stage...  And a halfway decent tank due to Q + passive
[5:19:19] Cardsharp: Hey JP and Chat!  How is everyone this evening?
[5:19:22] Darkaros: have you tried doing the ult + flash trick i haven't been payign attention
[5:19:29] Darkaros: Cardsharp ijpHI
[5:19:35] ghostsofcarcosa: @Cardsharp ijpH
[5:19:50] Insigmada: Cardsharp ijpBOOP
[5:19:50] JeXus1985: Even after watching JP play Irelia, I still have no idea what it is she actually does
[5:19:55] Karamor: @Souzen300 yeah, just a super annoying switch if you build bruiser up to that point
[5:20:08] i_revarm: darkaros if you wanna see some cool combos for  irelia   go look at  wickd secret  irelia combo guide, there  is some  crazy fast  ones in there
[5:20:09] ChiZWorkshop: they can't seem to push at all atm
[5:20:25] jmj1987: @JeXus1985 She kicks ass!
[5:20:38] JeXus1985: that I did get, she's been kicking my ass in-game for a looooong time :D
[5:20:44] Insigmada: I think she has plot armour ijpHMM
[5:20:45] GGuts: They have poke though
[5:20:45] Runforyerlives: They don't know how to end.
[5:20:53] Big_Headed_Gamer: lanes are set in your favor. they have to pull off soon
[5:20:57] DD_The_Shmey: hmm
[5:21:00] ChiZWorkshop: they're running out of steam
[5:21:09] DD_The_Shmey: woah
[5:21:12] DD_The_Shmey: big fight
[5:21:17] KAHVITEK: thats a game i think
[5:21:28] Big_Headed_Gamer: omg that vex ult
[5:21:29] Big_Headed_Gamer: KEKW
[5:21:30] Darkaros: HYPERCLAP
[5:21:31] m3rcer: Clap
[5:21:31] Sparky1232: mancoWinnable
[5:21:33] iUncouth: PUSH!!
[5:21:34] ChiZWorkshop: they had too much poke and zero initiative
[5:21:38] Airdor: Go win :D
[5:21:40] JeXus1985: vex engages are so scary
[5:21:50] DD_The_Shmey: wow, that was a big fight, and JP's team took it. I didnt think that could happen
[5:21:52] ChiZWorkshop: gg!
[5:21:52] Karamor: @JeXus1985 irelia can jump on people, and that jump resets when you kill with it or you hit marked targets, her other abilities mark targets, so she just jumps on you several times, the rest are passive stats for hitting things
[5:21:54] Boonia: vex giving the adc nightmare
[5:21:55] i_revarm: jinx ramped  up super  hard too
[5:22:02] GGuts: Now watch the counter throw
[5:22:05] C4ge: pugLego pugLego pugLego
[5:22:07] KAHVITEK: uh oh monkaW
[5:22:19] JeXus1985: @karamor thanks! that actually explains a lot :D
[5:22:21] GGuts: monkaW
[5:22:22] Big_Headed_Gamer: death timers are still low. can't end yet
[5:22:22] DD_The_Shmey: now the counter attack, can they hold?
[5:22:24] uui23: tryn knew they were up and bailed early
[5:22:39] ChiZWorkshop: shit
[5:22:48] Souzen300: man Mundo doing Mundo things
[5:22:53] ChowYun: Gg
[5:22:58] DD_The_Shmey: is buy back a thing in LoL ???
[5:23:04] JeXus1985: no it isnt
[5:23:07] afreak10: no
[5:23:19] JeXus1985: there's a character in-game now who can revive dead enemies if he kills the person who killed your ally
[5:23:19] StarPogPlatinum: omg ashe
[5:23:23] PenguinLore: no
[5:23:27] zechetto: @DD_The_Shmey You can "undo" some buys/selss
[5:23:30] zechetto: sells
[5:23:31] Convectt: you stalled long enough
[5:23:32] Gat0rCh0mp: corki kill was huge
[5:23:33] Darkaros: ya yu fine
[5:23:33] Ozoaken: LUL is this vex complaining about cloud soul
[5:23:36] ChiZWorkshop: whatagame
[5:23:37] KAHVITEK: towers take reduced damage without minions?
[5:23:41] ShockuhZuluu: GG JP!!
[5:23:41] Baske_T: @KAHVIGEN yes
[5:23:42] Souzen300: @DD_The_Shmey you can undo a purchase if thats what your asking.  But if you leave fountain it doesn't work
[5:23:42] PenguinLore: they made the same mistake your team made
[5:23:44] JeXus1985: if you can get elder, then it's game for you guys
[5:23:44] PenguinLore: overstaying
[5:23:44] Karamor: clutch kill on corki there
[5:23:45] GGuts: A Game of THROWS
[5:23:46] SoulCrusher842: they fooked up
[5:23:59] SoulCrusher842: their adc took tower hits when they were alone lol
[5:24:02] pandalisk9: DD_The_Shmey no, buyback isnt a thing in league
[5:24:03] Big_Headed_Gamer: coming close to next wipe is a loss. around 35+ mins is when death times start getting hefty
[5:24:03] KAHVITEK: elder dragon and baron up monkaW
[5:24:03] Darkaros: Nah Dota players talking about buyback is literally a function where you cough up an amount of Gold and respawn early
[5:24:06] Boonia: the throw inito the counter throw into a counter throw gotta love league
[5:24:07] shiftshapercat: Nice defense
[5:24:14] Airdor: :O
[5:24:20] PenguinLore: elder
[5:24:24] DD_The_Shmey: @zechetto @Souzen300 in Dota2 you can pay money to reduce the death cooldown... it's a mechanic known in Dota as "Buy-Back"
[5:24:38] Insigmada: what gives the undead affect?
[5:24:38] Souzen300: yeah thats not in League
[5:24:43] TheHolyPuppy: dota2 mechanics dont work in lol most times^^
[5:24:46] DD_The_Shmey: yep i got that

[5:33:46] psychic_ward: so are we technically 1-2  now?
[5:33:52] Darkaros: 1-2, yes
[5:33:58] KAHVITEK: rerolling those vitals also helps against fiora

[5:38:29] titanodin: place 4 vitals on you and heals if she can hit them all
[5:38:33] pandalisk9: she creates 4 vital points around you and deals a ton of hp true dmg with each hit
[5:39:15] Ozoaken: weak points on 4 sides of you, each she hits does percent health true damage and heals her with bonus damage if she hits all 4 iirc

[6:27:09] Das_Publikum: this looks winnable

[6:32:40] psychic_ward: now I know how little rue felt..... ijpCRY ijpCRY
[6:32:41] Pickedaname_: Feasted on Yi early
[6:32:42] DD_The_Shmey: @TyranidSliver Is your name a reference to both 40k and Magic the gathering?
[6:32:54] TyranidSliver: @dd_the_shmey correct
[6:32:57] Nianami_: what is this Lux build Oo
[6:32:57] 1TrueTyrant: @Griddlez Gotta remember that a lot of people come back to ranked league at the beggining of the season, so a lot of the mid to late season gaps get filled
[6:32:57] Nickonil: nice level
[6:33:01] Himurai: Good few early kills on Jax and he can just snowball out of control
[6:33:01] DD_The_Shmey: cool
[6:33:08] Achubra: jax had some nifty aoe stuns
[6:33:10] i_revarm: you needed more  stuns  to deal with  him
[6:33:14] i_revarm: he becomes a monster
[6:33:19] itz_just_camel: 69 LUL
[6:33:31] KillerSPER: Jax gets outta control quick
[6:33:48] Nickonil: i've been playing like 10 matches with friends now.. and... its not fun playing with people who are both better than you and enemies that are better..
[6:33:56] i_revarm: btw @itmeJP its  really  fun watching  you learn league so thanks  for doing  that
[6:33:57] iheartmota: smurfing?
[6:34:07] Felgrun: I'd ban yi tbh
[6:34:20] Karamor: @Nickonil wait about two weeks then most poeple wil be sorted better
[6:34:32] Noytron: I didn't know Iron was possible o.o
[6:34:51] i_revarm: the app i use called porofessor tells you who is  premade
[6:34:51] iheartmota: silver i believe
[6:34:53] Darkaros: Sadge I remember when Iron was a meme not a rank
[6:34:59] k5martdom: Yeet the yi
[6:34:59] i_revarm: overall id  say  its  worse  than u.gg though
[6:35:03] Niethil: bronze/silver is where most people end up
[6:35:03] stellasayswoofwoof: im an iron level player thats why I don't touch ranked lol
[6:35:08] ワフルデラ: divine sword gets a sword to fly on
[6:35:16] Noytron: I guess since new season it makes sense a lot of people are iron - silver
[6:35:25] lokil93: man.. I feel that me being bronze 4 is good when iron has the most people
[6:35:26] Glenn___Coco: <3

[6:35:48] iUncouth: Sett or Maokai support
[6:35:51] FaneDRG: you're against sett top most likely
[6:35:52] Tideshaper: veig maokai bot
[6:35:53] MrZiggz: diana JG
[6:35:55] i_revarm: if  you assume  rank=skill

[6:36:11] KAHVITEK: Double TP aswell.
[6:36:12] ladderoat: gotta love bronze cheese strats
[6:36:29] Noytron: if you are fast enough yea
[6:36:29] i_revarm: sett can catch you in a  dash with  his  e though
[6:36:30] MrZiggz: You can often tell who's what role based on who they ban
[6:36:35] i_revarm: and you have it on cd
[6:36:37] Niethil: @i_revarm it depends where in gold though iirc, gol iv isn't any better than a high silver
[6:36:41] i_revarm: its  tough to play  vs sett
[6:36:53] SmoothNomad: such am aggressive yawn xD
[6:37:01] Tideshaper: @i_revarm however if he's in casting animation it's free to q to behind him
[6:37:09] Felgrun: I think Sett early game just shits on you
[6:37:12] i_revarm: for  sure
[6:37:20] iheartmota: must have started e
[6:37:27] Karamor: i r o n
[6:37:34] Nianami_: I really like Sentinel Irelia, as Skin
[6:37:35] i_revarm: @Niethil my point  was  that you can measure  "skill" in a billion different ways, we dont  have to get into it
[6:37:44] Felgrun: Ward
[6:37:46] Ksiraan: ward
[6:37:51] TheJokerJustin: ward at 1:20
[6:37:52] Noobpownin09: could grab a serpents to reduce sett's sheild
[6:37:55] Tideshaper: think he wabts a ward
[6:37:57] Cellonious: ward maybe
[6:37:58] DeluxiZ: i always play the champ that they counter the most as adc and 9/10 i win those KEKW
[6:38:07] heavymetalhorns: Father ResidentSleeper Mother ResidentSleeper Zelos ResidentSleper

[6:38:14] TheJokerJustin: its nice to ward for them so they know if invade happens
[6:38:20] i_revarm: Project & High Noon best irelia  skins, project  for  hiding E and high  noon cause  it   smooth  af
[6:38:41] Niethil: @i_revarm yeah I get ya, my team play and objective play is great but my farming is ass, probly why I'm still floating around the bronze/silver range myself rooSlain
[6:38:44] Noytron: LUL cool
[6:38:54] PangurBanTheCat: Sett is a PIA
[6:38:56] Ebra: KEKW
[6:38:56] Felgrun: If he got Q first you woulda died
[6:38:56] psychic_ward: they should make people pay for better voicelines they'd make a fortune.
[6:39:19] Felgrun: @psychic_ward I mean, some skins have alternate voices
[6:39:21] iheartmota: they techniaclly do. its called skins
[6:39:25] i_revarm: @Niethil im kinda  the  reverse, i farm well, dont  look at the minimap and refuse to buy pinks (did i mention i play  adc) KEKW
[6:39:28] Papapwnage: learing Tarkov is hard, getting in to play is harder
[6:39:39] Felgrun: Auto'd the minion F
[6:39:47] Riluske: poo
[6:39:52] Tideshaper: close
[6:39:58] clumsy_gamer_19: There's a hotkey that makes you only hit champs.
[6:40:09] Tideshaper: still an okay outcome considering how hard he heits early
[6:40:13] Darkaros: OOOO who gets first t1 top tower
[6:40:16] Sweet_Threat: first item bramble OOOOF
[6:40:20] Niethil: @i_revarm oh I do mid/adc half the time you just don't get any time to actually ward for adc cause the support already warded the river area KEKW
[6:40:39] Das_Publikum: ouch
[6:40:43] mcboifish: KEKW
[6:40:49] Noytron: i can't believe that 2nd tower shot went through
[6:40:54] Felgrun: Either you died or yi died, eh
[6:40:55] Darkaros: COPIUM it's fine Yi gets some farm
[6:40:55] i_revarm: Im  extremely  happy vayne is  super  good  atm
[6:41:02] Infidel_Art: god learning toplane seems daunting
[6:41:30] DogeDrill: what is the name of the overlay?
[6:41:35] Darkaros: U.GG
[6:41:45] Felgrun: Ow
[6:41:52] DogeDrill: thx
[6:42:02] Nightshaft25: yeap
[6:42:03] i_revarm: setts  passive  is  nutty
[6:42:08] Darkaros: ijpSUFFER
[6:42:09] itz_just_camel: hows that possible
[6:42:11] Ebra: Sadge
[6:42:12] scooterjr37: he is betetr 2v1 then 1v1
[6:42:16] RoniBranco: LUL

[6:42:17] m3rcer: so much shield KEKW
[6:42:18] Sieggod: lethal tempo is busted
[6:42:22] Noytron: the boss
[6:42:26] i_revarm: when i get  filled  support i play sett or  trundle supp LUL
[6:42:31] Nightshaft25: yeap facts
[6:42:40] i_revarm: cause they have  the dumbest skills
[6:42:54] Souzen300: okay real talk, does Irelia come with a MUTE button?
[6:43:08] Nightshaft25: trundle good too
[6:43:10] Souzen300: I swear she talks more then other champs
[6:43:11] TheJokerJustin: Yeah yi ruined your lane
[6:43:14] i_revarm: you have an option in the  sound section to turn voices  off
[6:43:15] afreak10: lvl 7 already Oof
[6:43:25] i_revarm: or rather  adjust  the  volumes of them
[6:44:02] i_revarm: if  this  sett  is smart  he goes for bork then tank and you basically  never win
[6:44:40] rincon_: Still stomping as Irelia?
[6:45:05] Darkaros: We're 2-3 Irelia-spamming today MmmHmm
[6:45:36] Darkaros: jinxed Sadge
[6:45:55] psychic_ward: been alot of hard matchups today.
[6:46:12] StarPogPlatinum: that's the plan
[6:46:23] OdinX1: Thats always the best bet when you fall behind
[6:46:26] i_revarm: what  you can do is  take the top jungle camp when you got  nothing  else to do, gives  you some  comeback gold and  xp
[6:46:30] i_revarm: since yi ignores  it
[6:46:31] afreak10: mana
[6:46:32] OdinX1: Just dont die and give a bigger lead, and you're golden
[6:46:40] OdinX1: especially if other lanes are doing well

[6:46:56] Darkaros: ijpONO
[6:48:04] ApathyOwl: LUL
[6:48:10] Pickedaname_: he can't hit tower if you hit him. his thornmail draws aggro
[6:48:11] iheartmota: he got 2v1 and doesnt want to go back more than liekly
[6:48:16] Icecream505: lol the lifee of a top laner
[6:48:19] Bazorki: its fine your farming up meanwhile your team is winnig the rest of the map.
[6:48:22] Nightshaft25: he is busy fedding himself
[6:48:22] Noytron: I think they have resigned to leaving the raid boss top
[6:48:28] Insigmada: yi is scarred shirtless of him LUL
[6:48:38] afreak10: u need items
[6:48:46] Infidel_Art: yi's probably scared of another 1v2
[6:48:49] Darkaros: Yi's having a good time around the map, it's fine MmmHmm
[6:48:53] Insigmada: lol phone autocorrect
[6:49:03] Nianami_: Yi got Dragon and Kills, I think its okay he is currently not top
[6:49:03] StarPogPlatinum: if he come gank now pretty sure he can 1v2 you
[6:49:10] Bazorki: just ask yi to hold tower so u can base
[6:49:21] Noytron: I'd definitely abandon the tower once plating falls
[6:49:24] Adept_Zeno: As a jungler i think the proper play is to just help the other lanes win at this point. At least thats what all the guides i read / watch kinda say
[6:49:30] KAHVITEK: save the game KEKW
[6:49:31] afreak10: even if they gank u won't have mana to help much
[6:49:43] jordeon123: What is the yi asking?
[6:49:44] ApathyOwl: shoved like 5 waves in a row KEKW
[6:50:06] jordeon123: Baited KEKW
[6:50:13] Ebra: triple OOOO
[6:50:17] Nightshaft25: EZ CLAP
[6:50:43] Das_Publikum: that Lissandra was too quick, she should have waited for the yi
[6:50:43] nomadthekid: damn if only yi rotated as well
[6:50:44] iheartmota: life as a top laner
[6:50:49] OhTenGeneral: Imagine if yi DIDN'T take 30 extra seconds to get there
[6:50:54] Das_Publikum: yi was about to joiin
[6:51:03] jordeon123: @OhTenGeneral Truuue
[6:51:03] Bazorki: yeah yi shouldve walked toplane taking your minionsand pushed your lane with u instead of farming his jungle but hey what u gonna do with peopel that dont listen :p
[6:51:21] Nianami_: again, not to bash your opinion, but Yi got an objective with dragon and a double kill.
[6:52:01] Bazorki: true, and i agree with that but when he just died yi was farming raptors and kruggs over covering top. which is on yi
[6:52:01] TheHolyPuppy: if u know u can barely win 2v1 if even... u just ignore the lane and get objectives... and he did it
[6:52:09] nomadthekid: I like JP's League hairstyle
[6:52:12] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[6:52:18] Noytron: xD
[6:52:19] Nianami_: oh, I see, yeah. :/
[6:52:20] Das_Publikum: nah, Yi was almost at the top tower, he actually came after warding/jungling
[6:52:23] TheHolyPuppy: it sucks for top when that happens but u shouldnt gank a dead lane^^
[6:52:37] Souzen300: Use to jungle back like early S10, I really hated trying to gank lanes that were behind in the 1v1 cause its such a coin flip.  You ether make the lane better, or so much worse...

[6:52:58] StarPogPlatinum: Yeah ganking a lost lane can make it worst in the end
[6:53:00] Darkaros: you were still getting farm, sett wasn't able to back either, it was a fine stalemate MmmHmm but i always play from behind as a dota offlaner
[6:53:18] Nianami_: I just noticed, they have such a scary tanky team, with lots of CC. D: will be a hard game
[6:53:19] afreak10: F
[6:53:24] i_revarm: sett is very balanced
[6:53:25] Bazorki: @Souzen300 your completly correct, but instead of farming his topside jungle he couldve taken red and ran top to cover so JP coulve backed
[6:53:30] i_revarm: just  not the right way LUL
[6:53:33] Rednexi5: Who is JP laneing against?
[6:53:38] Bazorki: Sett
[6:53:43] Souzen300: and jp was about even with Sett when Yi came up.  They got the kill under tower.  Yi shoulda gone back into jungle there
[6:53:44] Nightshaft25: sett
[6:53:45] Rednexi5: thanks
[6:53:50] Rednexi5: new char for me
[6:53:51] Noytron: first tower down lets go
[6:53:53] cosmicD: honestly  the way to play against sett is to just outscale him
[6:54:12] Darkaros: MmmHmm 18-15, two drake kills, who wins
[6:54:21] afreak10: Veigar
[6:54:28] Souzen300: @Bazorki yeah, but you can't expect junglers to cover lanes in low ranks...
[6:54:34] Bazorki: i know

[6:54:54] Bazorki: now he comes xD
