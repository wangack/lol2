[0:44:56] ThemDemo: Did we talk about the image of Thor and Jane's new costumes? Don't know if that was out last week
[0:44:58] ReginaldXIV: She finds a key that is also a sword
[0:44:58] SZebra: She just runs around telling villians to 'catch these hands'?
[0:45:01] Tyronin: Moonknight and blade are the next bigs ones for me
[0:45:11] WDForty: her story might lead into how they get mutants into the MCU
[0:45:15] MasqureMan: Probably Celestial tech/magic stuff
[0:45:17] spideycsa: Maybe they do a champions instead of younf avengers
[0:45:22] Altair900: I am so excited for Moonknight and Blade
[0:45:47] WDForty: Ms Marvel is already confrimed to be in the Marvels movie
[0:45:52] VyRe40: According to rumors, they're changing a lot about Ms. Marvel's power set and how she gets her powers.
[0:45:58] ReginaldXIV: I could see Young Avengers just being a D+ thing
[0:46:03] Bearyman: Scarlet Witch is supposed to be in the next Dr Strange movie, i'm sure a lot know that already
[0:46:05] yodelrodel: Well Daredevil made the jump....
[0:46:29] spideycsa: It might be champions instead cause America CHavez is in Dr. Strange 2
[0:46:33] gimpx0r_cpa: all I need is more Kate + Elena
[0:46:39] gimpx0r_cpa: yelena
[0:46:49] WDForty: Kate + Yelena were amazing together
[0:47:03] SpaceDive: yo I'm kang
[0:47:08] BranBirb: they also need to blue kang xD
[0:47:09] ReginaldXIV: I'm Kang
[0:47:11] ETS05: his proper introduction will probably just be in Antman
[0:47:13] cruxk__: this is thancred
[0:47:13] LFC_Letters: Hes confirmed for Ant Man but he'll be hear before hopefully
[0:47:16] WDForty: Kang needs more explaination
[0:47:17] CorporalPibb: Kang will probably have a full intro
[0:47:26] gimpx0r_cpa: or multiple Kangs?
[0:47:33] WDForty: if you don't know the comics, you still don't know the name Kang
[0:47:43] ThemDemo: I think to understand Wanda's headspace in MOM, and what her motivations are WandaVision is needed
[0:47:46] Sir_Myrmidon: no Kang Cameo in Dr Strange?
[0:47:51] KatjeMauw: more explanation for kang? they spend 20 min on him narating everything about himself
[0:47:54] Tronix_604: new rumor for strange 2: Wanda will have an actual house of M dark scarlet double as the actual bad guy
[0:48:05] pc2400: they never called him Kang in Loki
[0:48:06] DrewM87: do we really think Kang won't just be post credit scenes like Ant-Man? or just scenes in movies to show a "bigger bad" lurking behind the scenes
[0:48:12] MasqureMan: Do we think this is a “collect all the celestial tech” arc? Ms marvels gauntlets, Shang Chi’s rings?
[0:48:12] LFC_Letters: A Kang teaser at the end of the new Strange movie would be great
[0:48:13] DrewM87: Like Thanos*
[0:48:27] Goldsnake: its risky if its "new"
[0:48:49] BrannonCannon: When do y’all think we’ll see Spider-Man again? Fantastic 4 post credits with Johnny Storm? @itmejp
[0:48:50] WDForty: an MCU only viewer (no comics or cartoons) won't know who Kang is, they won't know how Kang links to Loki, we only know that stuff cause of comic knowledge
[0:48:57] Goldsnake: thor 17
[0:49:54] Altair900: "forget everything you know, vampires are real"
[0:49:55] spideycsa: when will Man-thing show up?
[0:50:00] Sir_Myrmidon: everyone is either a vampire or a skrull?
[0:50:02] CorporalPibb: stripHmm
[0:50:02] SlipCrit: i mean blade was in eternals so theyre alread yhere lul
[0:50:10] DaRandalizer: thats the multiverse for
[0:50:20] WDForty: they can't do Blade without vampires, seeing as how he's half-vampire
[0:50:21] Ebon_Sky: street-level mystical stuff?
[0:50:29] ThemDemo: They mentioned vampires already in Loki as well
[0:50:35] SlipCrit: KEKW
[0:50:39] Munetani_NJimha: KEKW

[0:51:01] SlipCrit: one of the guards said they fought a vampire
[0:51:02] Altair900: yes, it is. that's why blade is gonna be hype af
[0:51:03] MasqureMan: The ideal vampire wants as few as possible to have food all to themselves
[0:51:05] Invess: They talk about the whole Miss America supposed to be in NWH thing
[0:51:12] ThemDemo: Mobius says they have brought them in to the TVA
[0:51:13] Invess: there's concept art for it and all
[0:51:17] VyRe40: It was a line about how they managed to capture all kinds of different creatures (including vampires).
[0:51:28] Tronix_604: with no spoilers , them making older movies Canon now, could blade be in morbius timeline? @itmejp
[0:51:35] Poobzee: meaning the TVA spliced them

[0:53:10] CorporalPibb: LUL
[0:53:12] thecynicalshuffler: i really hope the rumors are true about Nic Cage Ghost Rider showing up in strange 2. probably not but i really hope it is... lol @itmeJP
[0:53:17] SlipCrit: when i was a kids i saw a man come out the earth
[0:53:18] DaRandalizer: hotel bronze?
[0:53:23] ReginaldXIV: There's a pocket dimension with a dragon and demons
[0:53:27] VyRe40: "If Blade could do it, then maybe I could ice skate uphill too!"
[0:53:33] Altair900: one of the first lines of the 2nd or 3rd blade movie with Wesley snipes is "forget everything you know, vampires exist." @itmejp
[0:53:45] Invess: if we dont talk about the man in ocean he cant hurt us
[0:53:59] leovic1: Sadge why does no one address the man in the ocean PepeHands
[0:54:08] BranBirb: Namor says hi btw.
[0:54:09] LFC_Letters: I think Thor will mention it somehow as like a joke
[0:54:13] ReginaldXIV: Morbius will bring it up
[0:54:21] Invess: they'll probably mention in The Marvels
[0:54:31] BakinPacman: ghostrider and dr strange could open up hell etc
[0:54:35] KingRahe: stone ocean? is that a jojo reference
[0:54:45] AlexWrapYourStuff: SPONGEBOB invading MCU????
[0:54:47] WDForty: we really need a proper MCU timeline
[0:54:48] MasqureMan: That’s Earth’s ass
[0:54:49] DaRandalizer: SPOILERS!!!! 2 more days

[0:55:07] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[0:55:07] ReginaldXIV: Wasn't there a Namor reference in Endgame?
[0:55:09] WayneG947: what if its in a remote place in the Pacific and the government cover up the natural disasters it caused. No one would see the new "islands" because of where they are
[0:55:40] Curtdogdoody2: may as well include godzilla
[0:55:47] ReginaldXIV: Maybe there is no timeline and it's all happening at the same time in the multiverse
[0:55:52] WDForty: we don't know when Eternals happens
[0:55:53] ThemDemo: The celestial is in the Indian Ocean according to the director
[0:55:54] ThePurbleKing: Does the MCU even have a coherent timeline at this point? I mean, any rules they mention end up not actually working as soon as they're mentioned.
[0:55:57] brutalbhutan: it was weeks i thought
[0:56:00] SlipCrit: spidy was a day after he last one so
[0:56:03] DarkHorde69: It was weeks I think
[0:56:03] Invess: it can't be years
[0:56:13] SKEWR13: Namor is supposed to be a mutant btw
[0:56:14] andiago: apparently about 8 months after endgame?
[0:56:24] RobertsXD: who is the man in the ocean????
[0:56:25] BakinPacman: what if everyones memeries were messed
[0:56:28] Goldsnake: Namor is an X-man ye
[0:56:34] Poobzee: that'd be annoying
[0:56:36] Bob__Z: In before “eternals took place in a different time line”
[0:56:36] DarkHorde69: I think for sure Eternals is in a different Universe.....
[0:56:40] LFC_Letters: thats a safety net the always have
[0:56:41] Invess: They're not, that's hacky
[0:56:43] Sir_Myrmidon: it was the multiverse all along
[0:56:49] Legionnare92: but wont that mean "it doesnt matter" and they get to pick and choose?
[0:56:51] Legionnare92: wack
[0:56:51] GregoryGlen: DC KEKW
[0:56:52] gidley_: @RobertsXD the dead celestial
[0:56:54] Moonshaener: dont do Feige like that man
[0:56:56] Imbadyoureworse: is this a rerun or is jesse just on giant red space man again KEKW
[0:57:08] MasqureMan: Salma hayek isn’t canon?
[0:57:08] Imbadyoureworse: just got here
[0:57:12] WDForty: i'm in the camp of Eternals is still in the future compared to everything else we've seen so far
[0:57:25] LFC_Letters: @Imbadyoureworse hes gonna keep mentioning it until Marvel mentions it LUL
[0:57:38] Imbadyoureworse: @LFC_Letters LUL totally fair
[0:58:10] RobertsXD: @RobertsXD ohhhhhh.... thanks
[0:58:25] AnorienNightwish: we spoiler free?
[0:58:28] ReginaldXIV: Hawkeye vs. the man in the ocean
[0:58:32] Imbadyoureworse: i liked the kate bishop rehash tbh
[0:58:38] AnorienNightwish: also ijpHI
[0:58:45] Imbadyoureworse: its not small when its your dad who gets dead @itmeJP
[0:58:56] MasqureMan: Technically “aliens” attacked at least 3 times in the MCU
[0:58:56] BakinPacman: antman with the timeskip maybe similar to how the time difference happened between the movies and the avengers storyline
[0:58:56] Kurooben: my first mcu stream ijpNEVILLE
[0:59:11] Daruvik: and it was the moment of 'innocence lost'
[0:59:18] Altair900: I don't think most people can even conceptualize what the ramifications of that are though, Bronze
[0:59:20] Imbadyoureworse: killed her actual dad KEKW
[0:59:32] SolidzDPS: Owl's view
[0:59:33] ReginaldXIV: What does Kingpin think about the aliens?
[0:59:37] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[0:59:57] Imbadyoureworse: its like hearing a hurricane hit another country vs a tornado kills your own family. the tornado is smaller scale but it means more to you personally
[0:59:59] rarelybroken: might be the reason why it didn't effect her much.
[1:00:01] bakavic: did Kingpin get blipped?
[1:00:02] CorporalPibb: she's rich so she's definitely fine
[1:00:27] WDForty: Kingpin was around during the 5 years
[1:00:30] rarelybroken: there is a chance that no on in her circle was effected but the snap
[1:00:38] MasqureMan: She did have a caring mom, so that helps
[1:00:38] Kurooben: she had an its about me attitude in the show so not surprised
[1:00:41] Ebon_Sky: power creep?
[1:00:44] BlueSapphyre: we're getting to level 20 D&D.
[1:00:52] Garfieldd: what's the man in the ocean reference from?? I cannot recall
[1:00:55] Imbadyoureworse: LUL yea true jp. great look
[1:01:04] spideycsa: in the comics New Yorkers are used to all the crazy stuff happening
[1:01:07] Imbadyoureworse: i had that issue in my epic lvl campaign
[1:01:10] BakinPacman: its similar to how the people in the world moved on in falcon and winter soldier. the world was doing "better" in one sense due to the lower population
[1:01:11] gidley_: @Garfieldd eternals
[1:01:13] VyRe40: @itmeJP "Speaking recently with Empire Magazine, Marvel Studios producer Nate Moore opened up a bit about Eternals, including when it will occur in the overall MCU timeline. Moore confirmed the film takes place “right around the same time as Spider-Man: Far From Home, with the world recovering from the attack of Thanos and the return of half the world population.”"
[1:01:13] bakavic: eternals @Garfieldd
[1:01:13] xChimpyx: Stan Lee confirmed best DM
[1:01:15] SKEWR13: So they have to do like MMOs and do a stat crunch
[1:01:30] El_Zilcho22: @itmejp it should be like The Leftovers! @itmejp
[1:01:31] Garfieldd: @Garfieldd oooohh, haven't watched it yet! thanks
[1:01:37] Darkaros: Look to the chat member above you. Look at the chat member below you. One of you won't survive
[1:01:37] Imbadyoureworse: riots everywhere
[1:01:41] Imbadyoureworse: complete break down
[1:01:48] Moonshaener: @VyRe40 so like 3 Months
[1:01:50] Kilgorrr: everyone just went to work the day after
[1:01:51] ReginaldXIV: Only like 1% of the people got blipped in The Leftovers and everyone is sad
[1:02:06] Gundevil: People screaming about the rapture if that happened irl
[1:02:06] Ebon_Sky: @Garfieldd The Celestial emerging from the Earth during Eternals
[1:02:13] Protonerd: Post is optimistic Bronze
[1:02:52] Imbadyoureworse: ahhh i can see bronze's point here. i didn't consider that LUL
[1:02:54] CorporalPibb: ijpNODDERS
[1:02:55] Altair900: I appreciate that whiplash. I think it makes for good social commentary
[1:02:57] BlueSapphyre: whiplash? he wants his burd.
[1:03:04] Ravnim: oh my apartment is on fire, oh well
[1:03:08] Altair900: life as of recent is all whiplash
[1:03:20] BakinPacman: thats the point of the story line in falcon and winter soldier. certain people got better off
[1:03:28] MasqureMan: Falcon clearly should have chose a profitable life of crime
[1:03:29] Imbadyoureworse: kate is actually sheltered by super villians. I get what bronze is saying
[1:03:35] SKEWR13: Average person can’t relate
[1:03:49] Altair900: rich got richer was definitely a part of the message of Falcon and Winter Soldier
[1:04:07] shadowoflight_: iron man got beanten to the ground, so
[1:04:25] ReginaldXIV: I hope they address how little The Avengers get paid in a movie
[1:04:27] Imbadyoureworse: thats for season 2 bronze :)
[1:04:34] Protonerd: Well her mother saying that stuff at the end came across as super hypocritical cause she thinks her crimes didn't matter
[1:04:35] leovic1: LUL
[1:04:39] El_Zilcho22: LUL
[1:04:40] BarryCarlyon: ooof
[1:04:40] Pangaren09: LUL
[1:04:45] Protonerd: Which was probably the point
[1:04:47] Dom_Odyssey: i guess you see why iron man is wealthy you kinda understand why he is that wealthy. with kate you never see why or how, until kingpin
[1:04:47] ThePurbleKing: @Altair900 Which is a *very* weird message to see on a big screen made by a super greedy business that literally made more money during the pandemic
[1:04:52] Imbadyoureworse: KEKW jesse
[1:05:03] TheGoblinsGuide: doodDed
[1:05:09] zymioi: that would be a great punch line for her next tx show or movie
[1:05:23] MasqureMan: New villain alert: The Blip Archer
[1:05:23] Big_Headed_Gamer: @TheGoblinsGuide doodSweet
[1:05:37] Altair900: @thepurbleking not arguing that or saying it's good. saying that could be repeated ad infinitum.
[1:05:40] Imbadyoureworse: mcu crew dogs kate bishop for 30 min straight Pog
[1:05:45] gimpx0r_cpa: insert thanos is right comments
[1:05:49] ReginaldXIV: They get blipped and they come back still in their prime
[1:05:49] Chaocc: he is real. imagine 50% of the people disappear. who else but the super rich would care for the next few years for some awards? :O
[1:05:50] SlipCrit: i mean someone did write "thanos was right" i nthe bathroom rmemeber
[1:05:50] Imbadyoureworse: just lite her on fire
[1:05:52] VyRe40: "My subs are down though..."
[1:05:54] captain_doggy: Thanos was right!
[1:06:07] BakinPacman: isnt that the story in falcon and winter soldier LUL
[1:06:09] Heisuisui: but also half the viewers are gone LUL

[1:06:22] GregoryGlen: Ned
[1:06:25] ClancyGuy: People who get inheritance money and when they come back are like "....nah fuck you"
[1:06:28] ThePurbleKing: The MCU hasn't even properly addressed the poverty and trauma that would be the result of NYC being partially destroyed a dozen or so times in the past decade of the MCU
[1:06:28] SlipCrit: afriendgers
[1:06:28] MasqureMan: They really just need a damage control/mockumentary series

[1:51:09] Dr_Whoot: @gidley_ Jan 21
[1:51:12] BrannonCannon: Attack on Titan is just a great story. It transcends most anime and shows in storytelling and character development. No awkward anime jokes/tropes and all dialogue isn’t forced or jarring. Basically if Game of thrones didn’t run out of book material and wasn’t rushed

[2:15:10] AinzN: zymioi I believe it's one of the newest Samsung tablets so should do. I use it for graphic design and that

[2:16:16] zymioi: @AinzN oh nice i just want it for games and streams and such :) the thing is i have money on apple store in the game all ready for wild rift will that carry over u think É
[2:16:21] Joebeezer: Take off indicators and try it out

[2:18:13] Big_Headed_Gamer: yeah you don't want to gimp your brain on mastering CS with auto execute ability like irelias. only when you want to push lane fast or fast defensive clear to save tower/stop them from getting plates.

[2:27:39] Big_Headed_Gamer: we already have 900 dummies in chat
[2:27:41] Big_Headed_Gamer: Kappa
[2:27:44] EightBitDelight: @AinzN better late then never haha
[2:27:45] jingosaurus: yeah thats pretty good
[2:27:47] daumis1: We need training montage  music for this
[2:28:12] jingosaurus: yeah so when they run away you can stun still
[2:28:33] ranother: if u kill something with q it ressets
[2:28:36] zucroh: he kills the minion with 1st Q so he get's a reset
[2:28:48] Joebeezer: He last hit a minion as a gap closer
[2:28:54] CadaverLuke: he preps a minion, then waits for the enemy; Q's the prepped minions and E's the enemy
[2:29:00] Shoaron: you can trigger minion waves
[2:29:09] ranother: if u hit stun q resets aswell
[2:29:09] everkn0wn: I think he hits his stuns
[2:29:21] Icecream505: It’s because he marks them with itrllias passive
[2:29:22] Joebeezer: Stun marks them
[2:29:24] br4nd0nh347: marked targets
[2:29:24] Shaimaal: if the e lands before q lands, you get a reset
[2:29:28] mrshieldbow: could it be connected with W
[2:29:34] ranother: the mark when u hit stun shows it @itmeJP
[2:29:34] br4nd0nh347: you'll see that target
[2:29:37] zucroh: Q resets if target dies or he is marked
[2:29:44] Icecream505: Stun resets and so does ikr
[2:29:45] Icecream505: Ult
[2:29:50] 99Roze: e marks them for free q, q must be off cd
[2:29:53] LokiCanadian: E and ult both reset q on marked targets
[2:29:55] Kyriac: you have to stun them first
[2:29:55] DawnofFrost_art: Simple way to put it is E- Q-R-Q and then Q again
[2:29:57] DawnofFrost_art: @itmeJP
[2:30:00] RitzC: its the mark from hitting e that resets the q
[2:30:04] RitzC: after you q it
[2:30:04] Joebeezer: Because that’s not a minion
[2:30:04] freaker286: He e's while flying with Q for an instant reset
[2:30:13] zucroh: yes, stunning = marks them
[2:30:17] CadaverLuke: he kills a minion with Q, then E's, which means he can Q the enemy twice.
[2:30:29] Shoaron: isn't it E Q E?
[2:30:32] RitzC: you gotta q after the e hits
[2:30:32] zucroh: because you don't kill the dummy, he kills the minion
[2:30:33] appaomega: The flying Q kills a minion
[2:30:35] Kyriac: put e down first then q then e while mid dash
[2:30:37] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[2:30:38] Joebeezer: Think if it as a mark that resets q
[2:30:40] freaker286: E-Q then E while in air
[2:30:52] jingosaurus: e should stun while youre flying
[2:30:59] Shoaron: they need to add a minion dummy to this mode LUL
[2:31:09] jingosaurus: the stun should land before your q hits them
[2:31:12] Joebeezer: Killing a minion is what resets it the first time
[2:31:30] DaddyTopDom: @itmeJP put down first E, then Q, then finish E before your Q lands
[2:31:50] zucroh: stunning someone with E gives you 2 Q on them
[2:31:51] Kyriac: @itmeJP put down first E, then Q, then finish E before your Q lands
[2:31:51] CadaverLuke: a marked target is a free Q, so thats the double Q he does
[2:31:52] Altair900: good ollllll league chat

[2:31:59] Simple_Hero: Most videos I see of guides for Irelia says to use E to determine whether to engage or not. if you land the E then you would have 2 Qs and if you miss then you just dont engage and try again when cd on E is done
[2:32:11] RitzC: the q needs to hit after the stun, but youll be in the q dash animation while the e is landing
[2:32:15] LokiCanadian: JP - both e and ult will mark the target. if you q a marked target - your q resets and you can use it twice like you are describing.
[2:32:16] jingosaurus: Yea the second q comes from him hitting a stunned target
[2:32:23] jingosaurus: so stun, then q, then q
[2:32:28] Joebeezer: E and r marks enemy champs and big monsters w consumes mark and resets cooldown
[2:32:28] CadaverLuke: You do; if the target is E'd
[2:32:33] freaker286: No, unless you kill with Q or hit the mark from E and R
[2:32:33] zucroh: stun a dummy, then Q twice
[2:32:33] NomsTaiters: also reads if target is unsteady it also resets
[2:32:38] ranother: if u are already in the air with q casted i think
[2:32:50] Shaimaal: he presses E on a minion, then q's it, which kills it and gives him a reset, while in the air he e's the enemy, then Q's the enemy, which also resets, because of E
[2:32:53] thatguyuknow985: Drop a test dummy

[2:33:13] Simple_Hero: E will just give a 2nd Q without a kill
[2:33:16] TDotTerror: Chat: "Yes. No. Maybe. I don't knooooow."
[2:33:22] CastIronJake: like does it show when he activates it that mybe a clue in (i don't know)
[2:33:24] Simple_Hero: her passive says each ability adds a stack
[2:33:28] Simple_Hero: except W
[2:33:33] Freezetrap: The only thing I can offer is that Q says it's reset when the target dies or is marked, and E says that is stuns and marks the target
[2:33:34] ranother: slowmo
[2:33:38] zucroh: @itmeJP you can't get another Q if you already used q, the cd doesn't reset like that. Q only resets if target dies OR you mark them with E stun or ultimate
[2:33:39] Insigmada: "can you repeat the question, your not the boss of me now"
[2:33:42] DaddyTopDom: @itmeJP basically you cant Q twice if the Q is already on cooldown. you get 2 Qs if the enemy is marked. First Q consumes the mark, second Q puts you on CD
[2:33:50] Ikarit: TDotTerror can you repeeeaat the question
[2:33:50] Joebeezer: I usually read the lol wiki jp
[2:33:52] jingosaurus: Zucroh is correct
[2:33:57] Ikarit: Insigmada cohhLUL
[2:34:09] TDotTerror: @Ikarit Hey, you're not the boss of me now.
[2:34:45] AinzN: What does her Ulti do?
[2:34:54] konvay: 3 Qs?
[2:35:00] zucroh: he uses 2nd E before pressing Q, that's why he gets a reset
[2:35:03] Shoaron: ooohhh i see now
[2:35:07] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord

[2:35:44] afreak10: yep
[2:35:49] GrievAY: JP have you looked at Wickd’s guide to Irelia on youtube?
[2:35:57] CastIronJake: looks like he lands the first E, then Q then stun with e then Q?
[2:35:57] KAHVITEK: Irelia players are built different jesus
[2:36:05] CastIronJake: sorry just trying to help
[2:36:14] MattyTheBoi: I'm feeling bold today. 6-4 coming up
[2:36:15] jingosaurus: So he is getting 3 q's there. E stuns and marks, then he q's, then ult makes them unsteady, and he q's again, and q gets reset becasue they are unsteady.
[2:36:19] zucroh: oh wickd, it's been a long time since i heard that name
[2:36:25] RakusTALENT: i dont know if it makes sense at all but would be dope to see IRELIA in season 2 of arcane
[2:36:26] RakusTALENT: anyone wif me
[2:36:32] Joebeezer: You could try practicing on a champ bot
[2:36:39] DarthVlader: jp, what made you pick Irelia to focus on ?
[2:36:52] jingosaurus: @RakusTALENT Location wise doesn't really make sense at all unfortunately
[2:36:54] Joebeezer: They at least move and try to fight/run
[2:37:04] KillerOnIce: I think it seems that Arcane will stay focused on Piltover, with some Noxian influence, so Irellia very unlikely
[2:37:08] RakusTALENT: @jingosaurus dang itz
[2:37:13] cin_paii: hey @itmeJP / chat, I was a reg viewer about a year ago and just came back over the last week. What got JP into LoL? I've really been enjoying it these streams
[2:37:16] WeeMr_Goodcat: has league ever had a different map chat?
[2:37:18] Invess: List em
[2:37:19] afreak10: YAPPP
[2:37:21] BaosilisK: lil ru
[2:37:22] KillerOnIce: though urgot might be very likely
[2:37:23] BaosilisK: YAPPP
[2:37:24] GameOnlyNoTalk: litle ru Pog
[2:37:26] TDotTerror: Little Ru?! D:
[2:37:27] konvay: PepeHands
[2:37:29] RakusTALENT: so we might see DARIUS POG
[2:37:30] SlipCrit: little roux Sadge
[2:37:34] KillerOnIce: since he was a noxian executioner in Zaun
[2:37:38] Kyriac: lil rupaul
[2:37:41] lzrdou: @Cinpaii_wow !whylol
[2:37:44] Rodwolt: ijpKEK
[2:37:45] Dredstryde: @WeeMr_Goodcat It has the rotating game modes - Twisted Treeline (3v3) and Howling Abyss which is ARAM
[2:37:45] Akspert: LUL
[2:37:45] jingosaurus: @WeeMr_Goodcat There used to be a 3v3 map and a different gamemode called Dominion map. As well this map is an updated version of the original
[2:37:47] AN71V1RU5: @WeeMr_Goodcat only for other game modes
[2:37:48] afreak10: ijpKEK
[2:37:49] GrievAY: Little Ru? Isnt that the child from Hunger games?
[2:37:55] Shoaron: you want to hit the ult before the Q lands
[2:37:58] ranother: u land behind him
[2:38:06] KillerOnIce: all of them so far XD
[2:38:07] br4nd0nh347: he doesn't Q yet
[2:38:11] GameOnlyNoTalk: you have to mark before the q hits
[2:38:13] br4nd0nh347: E then Ult
[2:38:16] Shoaron: E Q R Q E Q Q
[2:38:19] cin_paii: @Cinpaii_wow ah thanks! didn't know there was a command
[2:38:27] DaddyTopDom: do it slow
[2:38:31] cin_paii: !whylol
[2:38:31] itmeBOT: Did you know that JP's beloved, Aureylian, is Riot Games' Global Head of Player Community? JP now wants to learn League of Legends to connect with her and her co-workers ijpLOVE https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1444862232140070912
[2:38:33] CastIronJake: the ult missed on the one you didn't get recast, it cast through him
[2:38:36] jingosaurus: you are q'ing too fast
[2:38:40] freaker286: There it is!
[2:38:41] jingosaurus: okay there you go that was perfect
[2:38:42] Joebeezer: Look for the mark on the dummy
[2:38:44] jjonnej: i think irelia should be nerfed
[2:38:48] DaddyTopDom: Stun - Q - Ult - Q - Q
[2:38:49] Shoaron: you're ulting after the Q lands
[2:38:55] Samstein: ye that looks like it
[2:39:01] afreak10: yeah
[2:39:03] jingosaurus: As long as you hit stun before first q lands it should flow pretty easily after that
[2:39:03] br4nd0nh347: it's fine
[2:39:11] AN71V1RU5: i'm pretty sure from watching pros and challengers play irelia on stream, anytime something doesn't work you just blame ping
[2:39:14] Ikarit: 1.4k dmg
[2:39:17] KillerOnIce: technically JP you can weave the ult in with the second E activation
[2:39:22] Luxtra_: remember to auto attack in between abilities
[2:39:27] Shaimaal: you should try and get 1 autoattack in between spell casts @itmeJP  it gets easier if u use lethal tempo instead of conq
[2:39:34] jingosaurus: clap
[2:39:39] freaker286: Thats it Clap
[2:39:39] Shoaron: no
[2:39:47] Kryllyk: Practice with W at the end
[2:39:48] thatguyuknow985: Don't forget the W too
[2:39:49] Shoaron: E Q R Q E Q Q
[2:39:51] Zahanator: Chat, is it just me or are normals filled with completely clueless airheads? NotLikeThis
[2:39:54] jingosaurus: can throw a w in there too for safety
[2:40:03] greymankle: !placements
[2:40:16] Kokoianer: you can use w to reset an auto as well iirc? been a while since I played her
[2:40:21] Destello11: @Zahanator normals also have mmr, so win a bunch
[2:40:38] Dredstryde: @Zahanator Depends on your mmr - but its separate from ranked so you may be starting towards the bottom of the barrel
[2:40:46] Joebeezer: Now practice using minion wave?
[2:41:02] CadaverLuke: he W is too slow. better to save it vs stuns & such
[2:41:10] Kryllyk: Practice without Ult as well
[2:41:12] afreak10: u always try to fish the stun , if u don't u back and try again
[2:41:12] CastIronJake: ijpCHEER ijpCHEER
[2:41:14] Zahanator: Hmm, that might be it, haven't played normals in a few years LUL
[2:41:17] jingosaurus: yeah so what the guy was doing was exactly that, but qing to a minion that gets killed first to hide the animation of the first E
[2:41:21] konvay: yeah, just like that LUL
[2:41:24] KillerOnIce: just ult 5 times ina row 4head
[2:41:42] GrievAY: Mods can I post a link to Wickd secret combo Irelia guide?
[2:41:59] Darkaros: yes
[2:42:00] Shoaron: no
[2:42:09] TDotTerror: The duality of chat.
[2:42:14] CastIronJake: ^lol
[2:42:17] Shoaron: QW on the minion then go into R Q E Q Q
[2:42:17] Insigmada: not much of a secret if there is a video of it cohhDerp

[2:42:43] Achubra: yes
[2:42:49] KillerOnIce: it doesn't sustain it, but last hitting a creep will
[2:42:52] Berzerk12NV: HOTS is heroes, this is legends
[2:42:54] KillerOnIce: er

[2:45:55] johnfive21: This is why I stopped using blitz and such during champ select. You get tilted before you get in the game LUL

[2:46:52] TDotTerror: OMEGALUL AAAAAAAAA

[2:47:23] DarthVlader: @DarthVlader oh ok, ty
[2:47:23] Shaimaal: @itmeJP you should get lethal in this matchup
[2:47:29] Insigmada: DarthVlader he was getting annoyed at winning his lane and not being a carry

[2:48:48] Goobbl: is there a clip to that scream?
[2:48:58] Insigmada: I think dr. mundo is worse xD
[2:49:02] ReginaldXIV: Mind your Ps and Qs
[2:49:04] Karigard: Winning would be s bonus
[2:49:32] AinzN: This jsut reminds me of Skywrath from Dota 2 where he talks for 5 minutes at the start of the game
[2:49:52] Notenoughcoffee: @Goobbl its the first clip when you go to clips
[2:49:56] KillerOnIce: lethal tempo
[2:50:00] keogg: yone top is such a faceroll champ
[2:50:10] johnfive21: Shouldn't fight that early if he has ignite
[2:50:14] johnfive21: And you don't
[2:50:16] ranother: nah lethal tempo (his rune way to strong )
[2:51:37] br4nd0nh347: hah almost there
[2:51:45] KillerOnIce: missing the last hit on the minion cost the kill, sadge
[2:52:46] bobphrapples: no JP it's ALWAYS your junglers fault
[2:52:57] bobphrapples: I main jg, I know this
[2:52:57] johnfive21: Well Nunu could have anticipated and tried to counter gank .. you always blame the jungler KEKW
[2:53:01] AN71V1RU5: very solid self criticism, you sure you are a league streamer?
[2:53:11] roflrabbit: i belive, just hit dat R's
[2:53:18] Achubra: that botlane is pretty rough
[2:53:21] OhPatooie: wards help
[2:53:29] Archangel3003: If Yone does his tether thing and goes on you and you stun him, does him like recalling break the stun or cc?
[2:53:52] Hopsinka: this champ monkaS
[2:54:05] Big_Headed_Gamer: he has a lot of lifesteal built into kit i believe
[2:54:06] Kyrvix: @Archangel3003 Yes, it completely resets everything
[2:54:12] mbryer07: this is why yone is banned alot
[2:54:16] Notenoughcoffee: LUL
[2:54:27] DCHenkels: yone seems like Dumb to fight against  no matter what champion.  Like who is the counter to him?
[2:54:31] ReginaldXIV: I don't understand Yone so I auto-ban him now lol
[2:54:40] BaronVonScufflebutt: @mbryer07 yep if i ever play mid or top he's pretty much my only ban
[2:54:41] Big_Headed_Gamer: YAPPP father YAPPP mother YAPPP zella YAPPP mods YAPPP chat YAPPP pepe
[2:54:42] Archangel3003: @Kyrvix Ah so he is completely just bs as a champion then, ok.
[2:54:43] blastboys123: well h e cant unthether himself if you stun him in the tether only if u do it mid tether
[2:54:51] Kyrvix: @Big_Headed_Gamer Doesn't have any lifesteal associated with any of his kit but his Q deals extra damage which helps with lifesteal
[2:54:59] Strewppid: is yone ad? malph might do well enough, and mundo maybe
[2:55:04] Joulupukin: take grumps
[2:55:06] ChiZWorkshop: Feel like I'm turning into a grumpy Crendor just watching this game sometimes
[2:55:11] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Big_Headed_Gamer Madge lies
[2:55:13] garry_leonard: I know this is gonna sound weird, but as irellia you won't get many jungle ganks unless the jungle is some with a point and click hard cc or you get ahead on your own.
[2:55:25] titanodin: @itmeJP Good evening
[2:55:50] Archangel3003: I've seen Strippin and that complain about Yone and that once he gets a shieldbow he's just stupidly broken
[2:56:07] GrimEnd: shieldbow got a slight nerf at least
[2:56:09] KarmaTheQueen: I think the better solution might be to go all in when he wastes he's E
[2:56:34] Spools_: I don't know anything about LoL. Is asking a teammate for help a thing?
[2:56:51] MasqureMan: @spools_ yeah, can’t control if they actually help tho
[2:56:57] Archangel3003: He is very low risk and high reward
[2:57:18] mbryer07: eat the biscuits to live longer ?
[2:57:18] roflrabbit: Bounty Hunter Nunu
[2:57:21] Infidel_Art: Yone is just Yasuo except easier, less punishing, and stronger
[2:57:25] ReginaldXIV: It's an aggregate build
[2:57:28] Archangel3003: I feel like him and Yasuo are just champs that just let you go ham while keeping you safe with a bs kit
[2:57:28] garry_leonard: bounty nunu
[2:57:48] Rectifier15: nunu Mejai's PogChamp
[2:58:06] Archangel3003: The amount of Yasuo's that have missplayed when trying to jump me but been rewarded for it and saved with that stupid shield that pops
[2:58:08] Achubra: hows that bot lange looking
[2:58:09] konvay: does biscuit recover health calculated at time of use or per tick? Since it's % based

[2:58:57] Spools_: JP is higher level than his team but his enemy is even higher. Team is bad?
[2:58:58] afreak10: Nunu doing a pretty good job
[2:59:00] Tnobuhiko: yeah you can go in if he has no stack and you have all
[2:59:24] jeffhunter12: its funny seeing a giant discoball just roll by
[2:59:33] Tnobuhiko: go in now or it lost
[2:59:34] konvay: @johnfive21 that's probably the better way, might be too strong if each tick gets better mid-fight

Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!

[3:03:14] johnfive21: Did Irelia always talk this much?
[3:03:16] hoosierdaddy000: When you 1v1 kill should push wave to tower so it bounces back

[3:06:38] i_revarm: shieldbow  and hehas  executioners so your  healing is halfed
[3:06:39] blastboys123: he scales aswell
[3:06:39] Notenoughcoffee: yes, first match
[3:08:11] Debazor: This is the 4th game in a row I've played that we have not had an ADC AND they left me to solo bot as a support
[3:08:29] titanodin: LITTLE RU!
[3:09:32] HaqmSakem: I wonder if League would benefit from voice chat or just be MORE toxic
[3:09:38] zymioi: @Debazor i had a few games where we had no tank or jungle i wanted to scream in to the void
[3:09:40] afreak10: more toxic for sure
[3:09:44] azuae: Strippin is stuck in Bronze III as well - playing jungle
[3:09:44] MrWeedoz: more toxic
[3:09:48] Jormunduur: Hey JP! How's the first game goin?
[3:09:50] eLMaQ: @HaqmSakem it has voice chat i think
[3:09:52] TDotTerror: Voice chat in League's toxicity incarnate.
[3:10:13] azuae: League has voice chat - if you are in a party before queueing up
[3:10:21] johnfive21: voice chat is only for premade groups
[3:10:35] afreak10: space
[3:10:38] MasqureMan: Moba’s seem to bring out toxic behavior even though the genre itself does nothing to encourage it

[3:11:19] br4nd0nh347: Yeah not matter how fed that Yone is, the enemy botlane is fair game
[3:11:27] TDotTerror: Nunu's out for blood tonight.
[3:11:34] Achubra: in it to win it now
[3:12:12] MasqureMan: @dredstryde that’s what i’m saying, I don’t think Riot or the game itself does anything to encourage toxicity. It’s just become a culture of blame carried over from Dota
[3:12:38] azuae: its because of how team oriented it is - can't do it all yourself
[3:12:38] hoosierdaddy000: Most online, team based games are pretty toxic though tbf
[3:12:47] Marcoooooz: ^
[3:13:15] TehMud: So... I'm going through old sidequests now that I finished Endwalker. I'm doing a questline with Gyorin and now realize why these catfish things are so popular.
[3:13:16] Marcoooooz: There are a lot of sore losers, and bad winners, out there
[3:13:19] johnfive21: You missed Nunu in that fight
[3:13:22] OhTenGeneral: They all backed off as you went in
[3:13:22] zymioi: any group project is toxic with no policing with randoms
[3:13:24] KillerOnIce: q everyone hit by it
[3:13:25] BlueSapphyre: @hoosierdaddy000 ofc, because it's everyone else's fault i'm losing.
[3:13:34] Laidjon: Doesnt his q reset when targeting tagets hit by ult?
[3:13:34] MrWeedoz: when you're stuck spectating for a minute in a heated game it's easy to just sit on other players shoulder and talk shit
[3:13:35] Pickedaname_: Cait was leading a charge. It was pseudo 2v4
[3:13:45] issalga: I don't even know what this characters ult does, gonna check in google
[3:14:01] Big_Headed_Gamer: you didn't need to go full ham after the ult. the ult was enough to get NUNU to say "OK, now i go in" THEN you can attempt a clean up. you became the frontline there and immediately got wasted.
[3:14:12] Catzumo: i think if yone misses his dash in a fight and you have ult up with team behind you win the fight
[3:14:18] afreak10: nunu only came after
[3:14:52] Dredstryde: @MasqureMan Riot encourages it by not dealing with it head on.  All that's required for evil to triumph is for good to stand idle.  They needed to have an active hand in shaping their community/environment and not just raking in the money
[3:15:32] Pickedaname_: Tribunal?
[3:15:46] johnfive21: Tribunal was fun
[3:15:53] afreak10: top push
[3:16:07] afreak10: or not
[3:16:17] Tiamattinen: how many tribunal reviews did you do that resulted in a conviction?

[3:16:39] Tiamattinen: because I don't remember a lot of the ones I did getting a conviction
[3:16:55] MasqureMan: @dredstryde you feel like people don’t actually get banned for stuff?
[3:17:00] johnfive21: I'm not saying it was effective. Just that it was fun LUL
[3:17:05] Pickedaname_: Double digits. I was lenient in judgement also
[3:17:24] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Dredstryde that's too much work. people are disgusting towards one another. it would take an entire team of people who need to be paid more than they are worth to deal with this community.
[3:17:24] afreak10: they have good vision
[3:17:41] Barba06: you're farming pretty alright at least so you're not TOO far behind on gold
[3:17:52] Mattt_CE: Hope everyone is having a good day, just stopped by to check out how the ranked is going
[3:17:57] Big_Headed_Gamer: I'd argue that's exactly what you should be doing. split pushing
[3:18:12] Darkaros: @Matt_2677 ijpHI we've jus started for the day
[3:18:13] Tiamattinen: Facebook had the same problem, the teams that looked at the reported stuff got messed up by it
[3:18:17] fells: welp.
[3:18:18] IIIStyXLIII: Hold on, playing League of Legends?
[3:18:22] Dredstryde: @MasqureMan Its really hit or miss.  I've submitted screen shots with racial/religous/xyz slurs and haven't received notifications a punishment has been issued.  I've reported people for afk and gotten t hat e-mail.  Its lack of consistancy
[3:18:23] ghostwind32: wow
[3:18:26] Keyah: Jinx is getting free reign
[3:18:27] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Tiamattinen atpCap
[3:18:29] clumsy_gamer_19: Most players are toxic to a certain extent. Dealing with toxicity would reduce Riot's income.
[3:18:33] P4ste: I feel like the whole toxicity thing is overblown, if someone is truly toxic just mute them, it's pretty easy to not engage if that stuff affects you
[3:18:34] eLMaQ: you dont have good team to engage teamfight
[3:18:36] afreak10: they had baron buff to
[3:18:53] eLMaQ: with 3 poke champs :/ it was hard game to win
[3:18:53] Dredstryde: @Big_Headed_Gamer They print money - but they just don't care.  Considering the recent lawsuits it makes sense why.
[3:18:56] ThemDemo: Just a warm up game my dude
[3:18:57] IIIStyXLIII: Dammit, you're better then me
[3:18:59] Destello11: @Dredstryde What are you on? Riot shaped the online perception that being toxic (they literally popularized the term) is bad. They established that leaving is bad. Early LoL days people would quit like it was a SP game. Thye made the tribunal. They've been great. People are still people.
[3:19:01] Mattt_CE: You'll do it
[3:19:03] IIIStyXLIII: I'm Iron II
[3:19:05] MrCoffee80: ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE
[3:19:05] Bebop400: i would love to see your Kench you play well on him
[3:19:06] azuae: should pair up with someone and duo your way out of bronze
[3:19:11] azuae: makes it much easier
[3:19:17] MasqureMan: Irelia seems like the archetypal feast or famine champ
[3:19:18] Cronopolis: Ive heard mid irelia easier, yea. Also, 0-10 yasuo power spike inc Pog
[3:19:19] i_revarm: yeah i dont think it  should be possible to get banned for typing  shit, just disable thechat for people like that
[3:19:24] Jukettaja: I would take a look at some Irelia combos
[3:19:29] TPLivewire: Well that was exciting. I missed that entire match helping the cops search my yard for a moose....
[3:19:29] IIIStyXLIII: Teammates also fk you.. What a game
[3:19:32] issalga: Irelia also feels squishy low lvl? again, I have no idea what am I saying, but feels like JP has a lot more troubles 1v1 low level with Irelia than other top characters
[3:19:33] Mattt_CE: Bronze is just a rough elo so don't give up!
[3:19:37] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:19:40] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Dredstryde in the society we are if you can build a business that literally prints money as you say. you don't need to do such a thing as care
[3:19:45] Jukettaja: Irelia and Akali play more like fighitng game characters in many ways. You need a combo to pull off
[3:19:47] Innex: Irelia is a tough hero to get down. Just takes practice.
[3:19:51] KillerOnIce: could try Yorick top, lol, nobody know's how to play against him lower ELO
[3:20:01] Tnobuhiko: you missed your combos from what i've seen, should be easier when you are used to doing them
[3:20:19] Crazy_Miner51: @itmejp Are you enjoying the games? it really seems like a mixed bag when people are playing league
[3:20:30] Catzumo: @KillerOnIce samee with camille, she absolutely dumps in low elo
[3:20:32] Dredstryde: @Destello11 They recently settled/lost a law suit for harassment culture.  They promote mild harassment as part of the "sport" of the game.  They have stats showing 95% of all chatting in game is harassment and leave it alone.  Happy to point more specifics if you wanna DM me but don't wanna clog the chat anymore with blocks :)
[3:20:49] azuae: Yes you can.
[3:20:54] Crazy_Miner51: yeah, there are item sets
[3:20:55] azuae: Go to collection

[3:21:25] R1ppCaTT: you can do character specific as well
[3:21:31] azuae: You get 2 that you can make unless you buy more
[3:21:38] Thorexius: what rank?
[3:21:38] azuae: You can make your own item pages too
[3:21:48] Mitartesio: You can make default ones not show. And for item builds you go items and make an item page JP SIR
[3:21:50] CadaverLuke: didn't the vid litterally include a rune section?
[3:21:55] johnfive21: You'll have to turn off auto import of runes from u.gg though
[3:22:00] jmj1987: catJAM coxJam ratJAM
[3:22:00] Thorexius: guys whar rank is jp
[3:22:13] jingosaurus: @Thorexius says in title
[3:22:15] Darkaros: !rank
[3:22:15] itmeBOT: As of January 8, 2022, JP is Bronze III in League of Legends (playing Top). This is his second season ever; JP started his League journey in October 2021 and his previous season high was Silver I.
[3:22:22] IIIStyXLIII: Get your builds from o.ggg
[3:22:24] IIIStyXLIII: o.gg
[3:22:34] Mitartesio: as in tick the "hide preset pages" box
[3:22:42] Thorexius: ob. gg
[3:22:43] R1ppCaTT: at least you don't have to buy runes anymore
[3:22:45] IIIStyXLIII: lol
[3:22:46] Keyah: It's best to stick to popular/recommended until you get really familiar with a champ. Most "pro"/high-elo builds don't work for people that can't use the champion to the fullest.

[3:23:35] IIIStyXLIII: Not really, it's fine
[3:23:36] SinkingWings: Yea, i tend to u se aggregates as a springboard
[3:23:37] Crazy_Miner51: @itmejp  Do you chance from Armor to MR depending on your lane? that could make a large difference. it's the last row of the 3rd set of options
[3:23:50] KillerOnIce: That's the general idea
[3:23:59] KillerOnIce: Lethal is just kinda overtuned atm
[3:24:17] GrievAY: The risk with followimg item buildpaths is that you do not take into account the enemy team
[3:24:38] IIIStyXLIII: Irelia is a difficult champ to start with
[3:24:44] ZMightyCheeba: went 1-9 in placements LUL got 7 wins in a row shortly after and now I'm bronze 2 limmySmug Challenger here I come

[3:24:56] IIIStyXLIII: AH, I'm sorry
[3:25:03] IIIStyXLIII: Still a hard champ
[3:25:06] KillerOnIce: could play hentai queen as well and get illaoi, just tentacle them up
[3:25:06] MasqureMan: There’s powerspike items, and then there’s items you get to counter the matchups.

[3:25:32] bogidude17: Started watching you play LoL a couple of weeks ago and I'm just curious what happened to Tahm Kench? I loved the masterchef costume
[3:25:34] Mitartesio: Just have fun with it JP and you¨'ll  reach your goal
[3:25:35] Jukettaja: I think you had some insane moments as Irelia far as I've seen
[3:25:37] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[3:25:37] Madracah: thats just lol streams. even happens at pros streams
[3:25:41] Mitartesio: arguably true
[3:25:44] jingosaurus: Illaoi is insanely fun. Nobody sees her damage coming
[3:25:47] SmolMoonCat: Have you look at Lolalytics (site) at all? Or just U GG?
[3:25:47] Archangel3003: You can follow an item build path and tweak the order for as you need in games. Also a lot of build paths also show situational options you can use @grievay
[3:26:05] AinzN: I miss the Kench ijp7
[3:26:11] synthwavegames: I always wanted to play league, but it's one of those games that seem literally impossible to play as a newb as a boomer gamer. LUL
[3:26:11] ReginaldXIV: I've been seeing Kench as a support lately
[3:26:17] bogidude17: Makes sense. Thanks!
[3:26:23] Catzumo: @itmeJP Back in your Star craft years, did you ever see this part of the "esport" side with fans who knows best
[3:26:26] SinkingWings: Yea lol im the same way
[3:26:28] gobbothegreen: good thing irelia works mid
[3:26:29] SmolMoonCat: They're doing balance changes to Tahm to push him back to support actually @ReginaldXIV monkaEyes
[3:26:31] azuae: Kench was made to be a support originally I think
[3:26:31] keogg: u got mid rip
[3:26:34] BlargMcBlarg: It's a good solid backup
[3:26:37] issalga: ijpF1 zeke4
[3:26:44] jingosaurus: @synthwavegames It is definitely difficult to get into now. 157 champions and climbing. Needing to learn what each one does is just crazy learning curve
[3:26:44] ReginaldXIV: @AWeeLittleFox That explains a lot
[3:26:45] DaddyTopDom: irelia is a decent mid
[3:26:45] SmolMoonCat: @azuae He got reworked a bit to be a top laner
[3:26:52] captain_doggy: I don't play league, and i haven't watched much stream Jp so im here 4 the ride
[3:26:55] MasqureMan: Does anyone know what counters Yone?
[3:26:57] SmolMoonCat: @ReginaldXIV Changes aren't live just yet though. They're on PPBE atm.
[3:27:15] SmolMoonCat: @MasqureMan What lane?
[3:27:21] johnfive21: could be jg
[3:27:23] jingosaurus: might want conc
[3:27:25] Shaimaal: @MasqureMan irelia, jax and voli beat him in lane pretty badly
[3:27:27] Lexanan: voli kinda owns irelia in lane lol
[3:27:29] jingosaurus: conq
[3:27:32] gobbothegreen: ah swapped
[3:27:35] Omakie: voli top is okay but its a conq fight instead of lethal
[3:27:35] synthwavegames: @synthwavegames but I assume there is a "meta" like I sure their is a set # of champions that get played the most, no?
[3:27:38] SmolMoonCat: Voli banned Master Yi so might be jungle
[3:27:54] jingosaurus: Yeah I think their 4th pick is top
[3:28:02] KillerOnIce: he's just feeling that The Call cinematic, lol
[3:28:03] SmolMoonCat: Yeah red 4p is def ftop
[3:28:13] Archangel3003: I've started playing Kench top after watching JP. Won 5 placement matches with him so far and one as Ornn as Kench got banned.
[3:28:18] Orkpork84: It means he's due for a loss
[3:28:19] gobbothegreen: hi smurf
[3:28:21] afreak10: Sett

[3:29:07] Radcosh: may be a swain top

[3:29:08] ZMightyCheeba: prepare thy cheeks sett and voli going in
[3:29:10] titanodin: @AinzN o/
[3:29:17] AinzN: titanodin ijpHI

[3:30:38] konvay: @AWeeLittleFox I like Swain :) but I would prefer playing more traditional support roles. they just do so well :/ and also a lot of other roles tend to go AD now, so Mid/Support are the only AP

[3:30:48] qyang1212: hi jp,hows the climb
[3:30:58] DasHibbit: Hey JP, do you have any interest in TFT? I’ve never played true LoL but like Zeke I’m hooked on TFT
[3:31:02] MasqureMan: Just watched Arcane starter pack
[3:31:10] SmolMoonCat: @konvay I recently quit playing support tbh. Bot lane in solo q is so coinflippy because it depends on the rest of your team
[3:31:19] cenwenki: oof
[3:31:21] jmj1987: Do it for Little Roo JP! PepoChamp
[3:31:26] konvay: @AWeeLittleFox it really is :(
[3:31:29] titanodin: little ru BibleThump
[3:31:33] hoosierdaddy000: What champ are you? I haven't played LoL for 4 years lmao
[3:31:48] SmolMoonCat: @konvay We won our lane! Jinx is 3000 and 0. Oh... The 0/1239812 Zed just 1 shot her under tower.
[3:31:49] afreak10: lucky
[3:31:51] NexxomV2: monkaS
[3:31:51] johnfive21: 2hp lol

[3:32:27] Radcosh: good night and good luck JP and chat
[3:32:46] Ellynas: 4hps at minimum
[3:32:56] AinzN: Wait I thought we were Mid? Did someone else want to play Mid instead?
[3:32:58] SmolMoonCat: To be fair with the TP changes using it to get back to lane isn't the worst
[3:33:00] bulletsponge55: Hey JP would you ever do a show like you did with Justin Wong but with League?
[3:33:04] SmolMoonCat: @AinzN Swapped lanes
[3:33:07] johnfive21: They swapped with Akali @AinzN
[3:33:30] Laidjon: Minions mvp tho
[3:33:33] SmolMoonCat: @itmeJP Did you ever have to play against Lehtal Tempo Sett before they nerfed it?
[3:33:39] Rave_Digger: The fact that Sett can use minions to set of his stun is SO DUMB
[3:33:51] afreak10: he gets such a huge shield
[3:33:51] Duo245: ww ignoring tower cs LUL
[3:33:57] Pickedaname_: The cone ability is ridiculous
[3:34:53] SmolMoonCat: This makes me want to play ranked again
[3:34:53] Neragsito: has sett ever been nerfed since release?
[3:34:59] KillerOnIce: all you gotta do is sidestep the middle
[3:35:05] SmolMoonCat: @Neragsito Yes
[3:35:06] titanodin: irelia is warm and caring
[3:35:07] afreak10: good poke
[3:35:10] Neragsito: because it seems like the type of champ that was just released and it¿s still way too fuckin op
[3:35:26] SmolMoonCat: @Neragsito He's been nerfed a good bit. He's just made to duel really well
[3:35:44] Rezzak77: dont you just dodge the punch entirely with qing him cause it should go through him
[3:35:51] titanodin: he was backing i think
[3:36:00] demigod791: hey JP hope you league games go well im gonna lurk and wait for Chi
[3:36:03] cenwenki: are we winnin chat
[3:36:05] GrimEnd: @Rezzak77 good point, you end up at his back
[3:36:12] SmolMoonCat: Technically yes
[3:36:37] SmolMoonCat: He came through your jungle @itmeJP
[3:36:39] afreak10: he came from behind
[3:36:40] jingosaurus: I think he came from above
[3:36:43] titanodin: ill clip
[3:36:44] SmolMoonCat: You only had like.. 2-3s when he popped upp from Tri
[3:36:47] DagooX: think above
[3:36:54] titanodin: D:
[3:36:54] ZMightyCheeba: I'm terrible for that, I'll put wards down then not look then die LUL
[3:37:01] SmolMoonCat: Nah no map
[3:37:20] jingosaurus: Something so satisfying about spamming q on minions
[3:37:23] Dragonheart9997: i have my map 1 size bigger @itmeJP
[3:37:50] SmolMoonCat: Top lane's so polarizing 😩
[3:38:19] SmolMoonCat: Irelia from behind does not feel fun for sure
[3:38:25] Joebeezer: kill golems
[3:38:29] Nathrael: Get golems
[3:38:33] SmolMoonCat: Hide in the top side bushes to soak exp or kill kruggs?
[3:38:33] GrimEnd: I love JP's dominating Tamh Kench
[3:38:58] Strewppid: AWeeLittleFox i would say the opposite zekeFLIRT
[3:40:05] Ravenwings4: that was a nice try
[3:40:18] roflrabbit: prowling!
[3:40:23] Big_Headed_Gamer: rip flash
[3:40:28] DagooX: the enemy jungler is near
[3:40:37] Poobzee: oh my a competent jungler?
[3:40:41] clumsy_gamer_19: Is he playing in NA server?
[3:40:46] Nathrael: your team is kinda winning, so that's good
[3:40:49] DagooX: seen a second get in before ww attecked
[3:41:15] jingosaurus: always a good goal
[3:41:20] DyingEros: A good jungle will literally change the game
[3:41:23] Big_Headed_Gamer: @Poobzee warwick is a super safe jungle pick. very few are that idiotic as to mess him up but SOME DO PULL IT OFF!
[3:41:23] SinkingWings: let em
[3:41:31] DyingEros: IMO one of the most underrated roles
[3:41:51] SinkingWings: not underrated, theyre always blamed for the loss LUL
[3:42:16] SinkingWings: it was not
[3:42:17] RitzC: no

[3:42:21] aerovan00: cobaltHi
[3:42:25] Poobzee: no
[3:42:43] DaddyTopDom: it had 13 seconds to go when fight started
[3:42:52] clumsy_gamer_19: It's really hard to jungle. Camp management, understanding match up in lanes, knowing when to counter jungle, etc.
[3:43:09] jingosaurus: could freeze it
[3:43:18] jingosaurus: nice
[3:44:03] afreak10: F
[3:44:05] Joebeezer: go mid to protect?
[3:44:23] KillerOnIce: if your laner is on opposite side, macro is usually to hard push
[3:44:38] Nathrael: set still bot
[3:44:41] Nathrael: u could push more?
[3:44:51] JustLetItBe: I played a swain top lane and it felt pretty strong. vs garen for what its worth
[3:45:11] Duo245: Teemo toplane always feels good
[3:45:15] jingosaurus: Sett is bot
[3:45:16] Duo245: LUL
[3:45:26] MaestroMurdock: would the loss of LP be offset by becoming more confident with the hero? for long term advancement?
[3:45:30] shadowsphinx64: try yone, he's pretty cool. fun to vs yasuo as him, everything gets a cinematic  feel lol
[3:45:42] clumsy_gamer_19: How does jp decide on which champ to play?
[3:46:05] Kyriac: could always play the busted ass sett too
[3:46:18] Grimreap3r361: dont think its you cause you havent really been getting help top in any games
[3:46:32] Joebeezer: jinx ult inc
[3:46:50] H4dus: evening JP and chat. How goes the LoL grind tonight

[3:48:34] afreak10: dragon fight inc
[3:48:44] jingosaurus: you got TP
[3:48:46] Duo245: I always prefer nonstandard champs in lanes.  Villian doesn't know how to play vs it + never banned OWL2019DVa
[3:48:50] Joebeezer: tp
[3:49:14] Dragonheart9997: bramble for sett for anti healing

[3:51:57] Nathrael: Guys, he wasn';t alone
[3:51:57] Sylarphile: those were some slick dodges though
[3:52:03] Nathrael: he won't play that aggro if he was alone
[3:52:03] OdinX1: May have been better to turn on the jinx there no?
[3:52:04] mbryer07: swain and jinx trap
[3:52:08] OdinX1: she was like half health
[3:52:08] Poobzee: he's level 9 but they were ganking
[3:52:37] Kadah77: idk if you've ever tried him but i always had fun with trundle, people tend to underestimate how strong he is in a 1v1. only problem is he's pretty kiteable
[3:52:42] azuae: funny when the support is the "carry"
[3:52:49] afreak10: wow
[3:52:56] konvay: jeez
[3:53:00] ghostwind32: thats just mean

[4:04:29] CadaverLuke: LUL
[4:04:30] verentnarv: @itmejp you should play Irela, i heard she is a very nice champ and you can easily carry with her. SeemsGood

[4:05:27] issalga: @Truder2k that was the "chat can go fuck themselves" command?
[4:05:29] MasqureMan: I wish 30 people in chat cared about me
[4:05:35] BuggleStrus: Its the right call. One-tricking a champ helps you learn to play the game/lane without worrying about the abilities itself.
[4:05:42] Truder2k: @not_issalga it was LUL
[4:05:51] towerwrecker: @itmeJP just play what you have fun with its always what works the best m8

[4:12:46] Pickedaname_: @KillerOnIce I mimic their pings
[4:12:59] Eyeofthehawks: Malphite is a meat shield with a godlike engage
[4:13:04] Eyeofthehawks: He stacks armour
[4:13:10] AinzN: GraveSalad ah my bad! Let's go team!
[4:13:30] AinzN: So Malp is a big buy who eats damage

[4:13:53] Rdei: minions hit hard early
[4:13:54] jingosaurus: Malphs whole thing is armor too
[4:13:56] Joebeezer: the groundpound lowered your attackspeed
[4:13:57] AN71V1RU5: his minions were hit you, yours weren't hitting him. adds up quick
[4:13:59] RitzC: minions do alot of damage early

[4:15:46] sond23: @Strewppid it's easy double with Irelia aswell, he just needs time to learn the combos

[4:43:25] Joebeezer: hey jp have you tried divine sunderer on irelia against tanky top laners?
[4:43:27] Dbrn47: I made a pretty decent effort with FFXIV, but ultimately I fell off of it @Soraffe but I think it has more to do with me just being bored with MMOs overall
[4:43:28] DerfOnTurf: modCheck
[4:43:54] Soraffe: @Dbrn47 I just dont want to wait for 2 hours to log into a 4k queue just to get a random DC and start all over.

[4:45:31] summerspeak: As a person who changed their name because of reasons, you do have to appear in court to have it done.
[4:45:32] hitbox_royal_rabbit: I had to do the same thing to take my mom's last name instead of dad's who I never met.
[4:45:40] bansheehero: Friend was trying to appeal to courts for years to change first name and that is nearly impossible here :(

[4:46:48] GameOnlyNoTalk: @zurf3r thats not an american thing, states are responsible for name changes not federal

[4:47:00] GrievAY: Wow, in Sweden you would just need to fill in a form I believe
[4:47:07] DokuroJim: I wish it was easier
[4:47:15] Aurkus: Why do they make it so complicated. Like why cant we have modern systems for the public to interact with the government.
[4:47:22] GameOnlyNoTalk: its a state thing not federal lol
[4:47:27] Victo0: @itmeJP cait top used to be played a lot with grasp because she would constantly trigger it and get 3k hp by the time she leaves lane, but that got nerfed a while ago
[4:47:30] DokuroJim: I had to pay 300 dollars
[4:47:31] tkcross21: red tape everywhere
[4:47:39] Krisser50: I have two last names that are "protected" because there are so few with that name. So if someone wanted to call them self the same, there would be a hearing amongst the family.. Also with a lawyer..
[4:47:40] Duo245: In korea, my wife owns me because I'm a foreigner LUL

[4:49:43] Deathevan: it may not translate into actual skill though

[5:56:15] ghostsofcarcosa: Kench was banned this time
[5:56:15] Debazor: Kench is banned this round
[5:56:26] allscorpion: jax vs irelia is a classic matchup
[5:56:27] GGuts: I still think since Master Yi was created he has been the go-to champ to fast blast through Bronze and Silver
[5:56:30] ShaggyTh3Dog: Ahh my bad <3
[5:56:56] Debazor: Glad you're enjoying Irelia, JP. Was one of my favorites when i played ranked years ago

[5:57:23] ShaggyTh3Dog: Ahh I understand!!! Hes just not enough of a game changer with out support.
[5:57:24] Debazor: I'm currently learning how to Taliyah support. LOVE me Tali
[5:57:25] MyMansBart: Support is going to start positive and then be really toxic by minute 10. Calling it

[5:58:21] Debazor: According to u/gg, Nami is one of the better supports
[5:58:34] jingosaurus: @Aurkus Sometimes. She got a minor rework though
[5:58:39] ShadowsparksTV: Nami will always be a solid support because of her kit.
[5:58:46] Rednexi5: She was my jam back in the days
[5:58:52] Debazor: Nami is gud girl
[5:58:56] ShaggyTh3Dog: Ive been really wanting to try Nami but she not in rotation rights now!!!

[6:15:43] DrewGamer: I think if vi can peel him long enough, ashe should be able to take out jax fairly easily as the game goes on.
[6:15:50] OhTenGeneral: @Insigmada It has to collide with a champion
[6:16:06] Insigmada: ahhh kk

[6:21:44] DrewGamer: @Tannrd yeah that would probably be a pretty solid 4th item for this game.
[6:21:47] GameOnlyNoTalk: the clad seems to be pretty good
[6:21:50] GameOnlyNoTalk: vlad
[6:21:55] Joebeezer: vlad is a chad
[6:21:57] Debazor: More like Chadimir
[6:22:03] Joebeezer: ayy lmao
[6:22:32] Sylarphile: Sadge
[6:22:35] Joebeezer: oh boy
[6:22:37] ghostsofcarcosa: damn
[6:22:39] AKraftyBasterd: bronzeSAD
[6:22:40] TrafficShark: theft
[6:22:50] Wholemane: that might have been it
[6:22:53] TheHolyPuppy: Your team should stop deal dmg to baron to kill voli first and let baron outside of smite range @itmeJP
[6:24:06] Walshmobile: lookin like vlad online tho
[6:24:18] StarPogPlatinum: yeah...
[6:24:23] Wholemane: Voli might be a good champ for JP
[6:24:29] mbryer07: vlad getting super scary big though
[6:25:02] Tannrd: you can set it to "Quick cast with indicator" so it shows the range if you hold it but can still quick cast with normal r
[6:25:09] KAHVITEK: Ashe damage modCheck
[6:25:11] Walshmobile: ashe doing negative damage
[6:25:14] Gecko185: @Wholemane maybe for jungle, but not top
[6:25:17] GGuts: Father, mother, Zelos, O-ma, Ohn, Kai, little Ruu... None of them ever had a chance. FeelsBadMan
[6:25:23] NixonNarwhal: meanwhile jax in mid :)
[6:25:24] Joebeezer: this is grade a clown fiesta
[6:25:40] Wholemane: @gecko185 He not good for top anymore?
[6:26:08] azure_savage_: damn well this just fell completely apart
[6:26:14] Joebeezer: just dont fight
[6:26:38] GGuts: Jax vs Vlad is actually an interesting late game
[6:26:39] Santalama: Jp is just smurfing
[6:27:04] Gecko185: @Wholemane Tahm kench is a better tank for top imo
[6:27:17] Wholemane: That baron steal fucked em
[6:27:28] Samc27: @itmejp is that your made up word Chinese?
[6:27:30] Soraffe: @Gecko185 Yes Tahm is a tank for Irelia is a tank destroyer so.
[6:27:45] CapusoR: hard to win teamfight against elder
[6:27:45] Tannrd: need to try and hold until elder gone
[6:28:04] StarPogPlatinum: bad spot to fight yep
[6:28:05] Achubra: jax just gets out of control
[6:28:25] Archangel3003: That's actually a good Taliyah from what I've seen of her
[6:28:27] markbart1: good ol zion
[6:28:36] qyang1212: a fed jax is just too powerful
[6:28:41] lStarkx: jax its pretty good iinto irelia
[6:28:41] roflrabbit: gg
[6:28:41] OhTenGeneral: They won via uncontested drakes
[6:28:47] Daruvik: my loot NotLikeThis
[6:28:49] mbryer07: jax is ridiculously easy to play
[6:28:51] StarPogPlatinum: drakes Sadge
[6:28:51] lStarkx: u cant make a mistake cause he just wins
[6:28:53] CrashTestDummy: dee feet man
[6:28:54] mbryer07: and very strong
[6:28:55] Daruvik: -175K RIP
[6:28:58] lStarkx: 1 v 1
[6:29:12] Soraffe: Old league lore for Jax was that according to the summoners rift arena rules, Jax was too strong with a real weapon that he had to use makeshift weapons otherwise he would destroy everyone and everything. @itmeJP
[6:29:18] lStarkx: also ur build its to kill squishies
[6:29:21] OhTenGeneral: Vi went full tank after sunderer
[6:29:28] OhTenGeneral: So she wasn't going to carry
[6:29:31] lStarkx: jax is not a squishy in general, even less after 6 when he has ult
[6:29:47] Achubra: these games seem to be going better than yesterday
[6:30:03] Daruvik: You held lane really well against him in the early game though
[6:30:03] aethybryr: 3/3, better than yesterday!
[6:30:20] Achubra: no jungle dianas asleep at the wheel
[6:30:28] Harm1n: @achubra it's the difference between bronze 4 and 3 if I remeber yesterday right
[6:30:33] tkcross21: how's the sanshabar ?
[6:30:51] Achubra: possibly, but there was some warcrime level greif happening yesterday
[6:31:01] Gat0rCh0mp: Does paying for U GG get rid of ads or do you have to pay for the desktop client?
[6:31:32] Soraffe: League hastily banned Jax from the arena all together. But in the spirit of the Institute, the League eventually relented, stating that a champion’s skill was no reason to remove a realm’s access to the governing powers of the tournaments.Jax was reinstated, but with one rule: He is only allowed to fight with weapons the League deems suitable. For now, that list includes a lamppost, a chicken’s foot, a spatula, and a fishing rod. @itmeJP I know it's a lot i just thought it was cool
[6:31:39] Achubra: good old auotfill
[6:31:39] Snowplex: autofilled cirSlain
[6:31:42] StarPogPlatinum: oh no
[6:31:48] Wholemane: Noooo
[6:31:49] Joebeezer: F
[6:31:59] Joebeezer: Well shit
[6:32:00] Tannrd: could have atleast asked to trade first lol
[6:32:00] ghostsofcarcosa: uh oh
[6:32:01] TrafficShark: rip
[6:32:11] CryoWalks: should ask to trade before dodging
[6:32:11] garry_leonard: We could watch jungle guide videos
[6:32:15] fells: can you turn it off?
[6:32:25] StarPogPlatinum: you should have waited a bit to see if someone else wanted to dodge
[6:32:41] Hopsinka: 30 min monkaS
[6:32:43] Harm1n: you can't turn off autofill, if it wants to mess with you, it will
[6:32:44] mr_moustachi: NotLikeThis
[6:32:50] Wholemane: LUL
[6:32:53] Achubra: some irelia videos then?
[6:32:58] fells: react stream time Kappa
[6:32:58] crzymike: ijpD
[6:32:58] Hopsinka: time to make alt account Kappa
[6:33:02] markamodo: And now you see why everyone in league has multiple accounts
[6:33:06] Joebeezer: practice time?
[6:33:09] garry_leonard: Yeah you're suppose to pick a troll jungle like lux or something, and then see if some one dodges
[6:33:11] SamMFJackson: man, i cant believe the log in queues for FFXIV are still a thing
[6:33:11] amonwhite: tft?
[6:33:11] itmeBOT: @amonwhite your message has been received
[6:33:12] Rednexi5: lets watch avatar?
[6:33:19] Rionok: @harm1n you can turn off autofill if you main support Kappa
[6:33:20] Hopsinka: irelia videos Pog
[6:33:26] kibriel: fire up the backup account, pro gamer
[6:33:26] CrashTestDummy: CoolStoryBob
[6:33:34] stringz: :D
[6:33:34] Harm1n: @markamodo or just play support and always be autofilled
[6:33:35] Tannrd: idk if id go rageblade
[6:33:36] Lilmistwuble: eat and watch videos coxJam coxJam
[6:33:37] Achubra: oh look a jax
[6:33:38] Tannrd: unless super ahead
[6:34:23] Achubra: max stacks do work
[6:34:35] stringz: why not, full stacks and both are lvl 1
[6:34:38] lStarkx: irelia lvl 1 its one of the strongest champs
[6:34:38] StarPogPlatinum: he probably know the matchup very well
[6:34:42] lStarkx: u gotta build the passive
[6:34:45] Tannrd: garen cant trade back level 1
[6:35:04] stringz: and she killed his whole wave, while her wave is mostly alive DatSheffy
[6:35:07] lStarkx: if u r 5 stacks very few champs can fight u lvl 1 if any tbh xD
[6:35:46] stringz: cull
[6:35:47] Santalama: cull
[6:35:50] flyingmangos2: Cull it's for farming
[6:35:57] Joebeezer: w max second
[6:36:19] MyMansBart: His team is 2-0 in 3 minutes? This vid isn't realistic Kappa
[6:36:47] stringz: garen is actually free
[6:36:57] Snowplex: i like how people underestimate irelia's passive early game
[6:37:27] Tannrd: every cs you get 1 gold and at 100 cs you get 300 gold
[6:37:30] allscorpion: gives you gold after killing 100 minions, which is the 91 number
[6:37:34] Tannrd: it pays for itself and you get free stats after
[6:38:22] Gat0rCh0mp: ramus has a taunt
[6:38:26] Gat0rCh0mp: that brings him back
[6:38:31] CrashTestDummy: :D
[6:38:32] Hopsinka: lol
[6:38:36] stringz: @itmeJP lethal tempo max stacks give attack range as well :D
[6:38:37] Unodamuffinman: rammus taunts though.
[6:38:53] Infidel_Art: which it will be next patch
[6:39:07] allscorpion: this guy bases a lot
[6:39:36] stringz: better to spend that gold to capitalise on the ahead he is in
[6:39:38] Joebeezer: base timing is a skill
[6:40:08] flyingmangos2: That was Ult+Q damage
[6:40:11] Braumchu: that's ult + dash at the same time
[6:40:17] Joebeezer: it's q+R+passive
[6:40:20] stringz: lethal tempo stacking so he is doing faster and faster attacks and Garen is lvls behind
[6:40:21] Crooster: garen had a pickaxe, so no armor basically
[6:40:30] StarPogPlatinum: he times his passive well
[6:40:38] everkn0wn: he maximized there though.
[6:41:12] Santalama: yup
[6:41:12] Proph89: He said he maxes w second
[6:41:14] scooterjr37: hw did it second
[6:41:27] CadaverLuke: vid explained: W is good for damage reduction, so he maxes it second
[6:41:31] scooterjr37: the reduction fdor damage
[6:41:38] StarPogPlatinum: damage reduction strong
[6:41:48] vibration1130: learning base timings to minimize minion loses was one of the best things i learned
[6:42:01] stringz: and maxing a skill generally makes its cd lower
[6:42:06] garry_leonard: W is really goo when an enemy has a big important ability that is easy to prodict. Like Jax
[6:42:08] Santalama: The base damage is very high and the mitigation is vey handy to all in TF when you dont build bruiser items until 3rd usually
[6:42:12] stringz: or putting lvls in it rather
[6:42:20] Snowplex: Freezing is also a key thing to learn as you get better in top lane cirISee
[6:42:21] Santalama: not sure but i thought there was a time where pro irelias that go mid maxed W
[6:42:23] Santalama: because of that
[6:42:33] Santalama: or went 2-3 levels q not sure
[6:43:08] chowdubs: dude is a straight bully hahahha i love it
[6:43:10] Dbrn47: what rank is this guy
[6:43:33] AlvincatX: R is directional from you
[6:43:47] Hopsinka: why didnt he use W atleast
[6:43:50] stringz: maybe just delay R to be more confortable hitting it
[6:44:05] stringz: no need to rush it most of the time
[6:44:16] Santalama: Hopsinka wouldn't have mattered, he wanted to create space and time for E W
[6:44:22] kosarkislev: does R go through minions?
[6:44:32] Santalama: yes
[6:45:07] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[6:45:24] Hopsinka: easy to play 4Head
[6:45:37] kosarkislev: easy just all in EZ
[6:45:50] Santalama: well knowing if you are stronger than them in 1v1 is a pretty big skill and knowledge base to say its "very easy"
[6:45:59] Snowplex: just mark
[6:46:11] Sonatta: 3v1ing him, they mad LUL
[6:46:17] Xinder88: Guidemaker is feeding. Vid worthless. Kappa
[6:46:30] watermelontwitch: PepoG
[6:46:49] Sonatta: cohhNotes
[6:46:50] a6314: Twitch sumSmash stop changing my settings and breaking my Add-ons
[6:46:51] Puffywiggles: E gives you 2 charges of Q
[6:46:52] Edot_KH: nope
[6:46:53] ワフルデラ: no, I'm a support main
[6:46:53] titanodin: cohhJam

[6:47:02] Sylarphile: PepoG I'm gonna be such a good backseater
[6:47:03] watermelontwitch: NODDERS
[6:47:06] Debazor: Sorry- I got lost around level 1. Can you repeat?
[6:47:08] SchnellBier: PepoG
[6:47:11] Puffywiggles: So you can Q 3 times with E and ult
[6:47:34] MyMansBart: Does leveling E extend the stun at all or is it just damage?
[6:47:41] Snowplex: most go W second just for the damage redutction
[6:48:05] Dbrn47: that's the only issue with pushing towers.  the experience is that the other team gets help and you don't, so you might just end up ganked more.
[6:48:07] Puffywiggles: Yeah he's getting camped
[6:48:19] jjoseneves: farm with Q its no so hard kekw
[6:48:33] lStarkx: Watch ireliaCarriesU plays xD
[6:48:37] TDotTerror: Taking notes for Little Ru. PepoG
[6:48:51] s_k_o_m: the mental game?
[6:48:59] sunnnyblues: Yeah splitpushing is really good for solo play
[6:49:06] Pulsifur: or blade tf
[6:49:08] Cronopolis: If your team is letting you down, its best to splitpush
[6:49:09] ワフルデラ: depends on how much stronger you are than the other team
[6:49:10] Ceratic: Yeah objectives and map control > kills
[6:49:20] ワフルデラ: sometimes you can carry your team into some extra gold
[6:49:26] Snowplex: yeah thats why sometimes if enemy is all in one side just push from opposite side
[6:49:26] CapusoR: depends on game though, winning a 5v4 and getting a drag might be worth more than a turret and a kill on top
[6:49:27] KAHVITEK: Maybe some enemy jungle too.
[6:49:33] garry_leonard: Yeah you spend alot of time with team or worrying about not being with your team. You should take objectives to win the game
[6:49:37] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[6:49:38] titanodin: i love that ward placement
[6:49:44] titanodin: i ward that all the time
[6:49:51] Cronopolis: Half this video is macro theory
[6:50:03] jjoseneves: garen is bada
[6:50:07] stringz: he does so much dmg cuz he is ahead
[6:50:10] stringz: rly ahead
[6:50:11] JimB0b0: he autos way more
[6:50:15] CrashTestDummy: i like skill-shot champs
[6:50:20] stringz: and stacked lethal tempo helps
[6:50:33] StarPogPlatinum: he sure does
[6:50:44] stringz: yeah lethal tempo is crazy nowdays
[6:50:48] garry_leonard: You have to use ability, auto, use abilitiy, auto, etc
[6:50:51] KAHVITEK: Do you use the auto attack setting?
[6:50:51] zucroh: @itmeJP you could always watch a replay of yourself and see what you did wrong
[6:50:52] mbryer07: running cull is a bit of a risky build but also pays off if you can get 100 cs fast
[6:51:03] SchnellBier: have to be careful to not play irelia like a mage
[6:51:06] AlterAngelus: Do you use an attack move keybind?
[6:51:39] stringz: garen KEKW
[6:51:55] titanodin: lol SLAPPED
[6:51:58] jjoseneves: irelia its so fucking broken
[6:52:04] MyMansBart: Yeh he does the auto then walk which I always forget to do KEKW
[6:52:04] AinzN: We'll get to this point one day! ijpPRAY
[6:52:05] Sonatta: hiding the E under a Q is pretty slick
[6:52:05] monamibob: little temple
[6:52:06] bairdman: bork is often best 1sst item on aa bruisers
[6:52:07] stringz: yes I believe lethal tempo might be better for u JP
[6:52:08] StarPogPlatinum: it's a lot of micro to get every auto you can get
[6:52:12] garry_leonard: I think you are doing pretty well. You just don't know the match up very well, and you don't know what to do mid game
[6:52:12] Snowplex: cirFumo Better nerf irelia
[6:52:21] titanodin: LUL
[6:52:23] ワフルデラ: Quin's bird is bigger than her hitbox iirc
[6:52:25] AinzN: ijpKEK
[6:52:31] Cronopolis: not balanced KEKW
[6:52:31] SchnellBier: I mean you started playing her a few days ago and some play her for years
[6:52:34] titanodin: double life steal too
[6:52:36] CapusoR: it's a skill gap between him and enemy team, not indicative of equal play
[6:52:37] JacHighwind: i think its all about her passive her autos just do way more
[6:52:43] everkn0wn: do you know about shift click jp? it auto attacks nearby.
[6:53:05] Cronopolis: I just bind "attack move" to the "a" key like old school rts
[6:53:09] jjoseneves: irelia its a balanced champion LUL
[6:53:12] BlargMcBlarg: 1v9 LUL
[6:53:29] DerfOnTurf: Absolutely not balanced LUL
[6:53:33] JacHighwind: irelia abuser WeirdDude
[6:53:42] Xinder88: That's the other reason to learn Irelia imo. The fact she can work in Top or Mid, you don't have to necessarily be nervous if you get filled into Mid.
[6:53:55] monamibob: just be gooder
[6:54:04] Dbrn47: rooBlank
[6:54:32] StarPogPlatinum: don't do this PepoG
[6:54:52] watermelontwitch: no die PepoG

[6:55:33] tkcross21: selfish laning PepoG
[6:55:38] Edot_KH: go in on a 1v4, got it
[6:55:41] TDotTerror: "Don't do anything I wouldn't do...or I did." PepoG
[6:55:50] ワフルデラ: win lane win game NODDERS
[6:55:52] dommi132: 1v4 = pro
[6:56:14] MyMansBart: Basically just go balls to the wall lvl 1 then snowball
[6:56:26] KAHVITEK: My man doesnt even mention the bonus damage to shielded enemies KEKW
[6:56:36] stringz: ez cuz annie used everthing LUL
[6:56:47] Kyriac: ez cuz hes fed
[6:56:48] Dbrn47: me too
[6:56:55] stringz: dead man flashed
[6:56:59] Eyeofthehawks: Its so hard to learn a lot of the  fundamentals of the game in lower elo too, because nothing teaches you
[6:57:00] CapusoR: game is somewhere gold-plat probably
[6:57:00] Joebeezer: LUL
[6:57:04] Achubra: woosh on that ult
[6:57:08] monamibob: little tempo
[6:57:16] titanodin: hes trying to dodge the blind
[6:57:24] ワフルデラ: nah, Quinn can blind Irelia and then you're actually useless KEKW
[6:57:26] jjonnej: is this some gold players guide lmao
[6:58:07] Eyeofthehawks: Stil lhad some really good info
[6:58:09] Eyeofthehawks: "Play the map"
[6:58:17] Eyeofthehawks: Thats 99% of climbing out of Silver lol
[6:58:21] allscorpion: only tp if it's good PepoG
[6:58:24] tkcross21: make the team wait for you PepoG
[6:58:29] stringz: :D
[6:58:39] AinzN: PepoG Absolutely insane
[6:58:46] Infidel_Art: insane damage PepoG
[6:58:50] JimB0b0: you dont want auto attack really
[6:58:54] watermelontwitch: big boink, insane NODDERS
[6:59:05] jjoseneves: ire LUL ia
[6:59:06] allscorpion: better to a click on people
[6:59:12] Thiwaz: don't use autoattack. quick attack is enough
[6:59:15] Cronopolis: A LOT of games, JP Kappa
[6:59:18] AlterAngelus: If you have attack move that should be fine
[6:59:39] Eyeofthehawks: A move and Right Click targeted is all i ever used
[6:59:53] Kijito11: Kijito11 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 92 months, currently on a 92 month streak!

[7:00:02] allscorpion: playing a champ a lot makes you better PepoG
[7:00:24] Eyeofthehawks: Being 18/2 you should fight PepoG
[7:00:30] Farnzy11: I jumped into stream and it was muted so for about 5 mins I was like, okay JP god Irelia ijpKEK
[7:00:57] Eyeofthehawks: The guide should honestly end when youre up 10 kills over deaths lol
[7:01:12] CapusoR: i think that watching a pro player Irelia lane and try to understand why he does things teaches a lot more

[7:04:02] Eyeofthehawks: League definitely lasts longer when someone holds you hostage
[7:04:03] P0rtilo: You can't play without your team in OW
[7:04:08] arslant: @itmeJP Why not pick some easier champs for top lane. Wukong is pretty easy and fun bruiser
[7:04:09] Launs: overwatch is very toxic, but league as that vintage rage toxicity
[7:04:22] MyMansBart: OW solo was horrible because you teamfight straight away
[7:04:32] sunnnyblues: In league if a game goes bad, you have to suffer 40+ minutes. OW games are way shorter
[7:04:36] Lilmistwuble: Junkrat tyre always brings a smile.
