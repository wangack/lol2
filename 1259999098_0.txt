[0:30:47] Pulseonfire: probably Xiaoxiang

[0:30:56] maniacoakz: Deokdam is leagues better than Ghost.
[0:30:58] arionexus: hoya is just average or more low but burdol haha this guy haha i dont know why he is pro
[0:31:00] fguydg123: CaitlynS
[0:31:24] maniacoakz: And Hoya is honestly underrated and probably will look really good on a good team. He wont be any worse than Khan but not as godo as Nuguri
[0:31:34] eu_lost_in_playins_kekw: rascal renekton otp life has no ruler to carry him cuzz is herbivore jg @weq19892
[0:31:38] maniacoakz: But having an insane bot lane will help DK a lot. Deokdam and Kellin can win games on their own
[0:31:57] lazer1043: GHOST sucks
[0:31:59] Lounell_: what in the christian rock
[0:32:01] immortalis202: tbh i think that burdol can learn and shows off in dk
[0:32:09] maniacoakz: @arionexus lmao at writing off a 17 year old rookie
[0:32:11] Pulseonfire: sometimes I wonder if Faker wasn't playing but coaching SKT and they have a new mid laner LOL would they be trash?
[0:32:23] maniacoakz: Zeus looked like garbage took as a 17 year old rookie, means nothing
[0:32:24] dundy3: JDG vs EDG PogU
[0:32:24] weq19892: yee  DK 4th place LCK Kappa Kappa
[0:32:35] maniacoakz: Now the report is he is dominating everyone in scrimms
[0:32:55] MilkPlease: people forget that Ghost was the one who made DK win worlds 2020
[0:32:55] maniacoakz: No 17 year old top laner will be good, even Bin was trash in his spring debut
[0:33:01] eu_lost_in_playins_kekw: DRX or KDF will take 4th seed at worlds
[0:33:09] maniacoakz: Ghost is terrible
[0:33:13] dundy3: wait who is zeus even playing for SKT?
[0:33:34] arionexus: no way burdol could rise up, unlike  zeus with so much champion pool just get up and wash up your face
[0:33:44] shinwinter: @Pulseonfire imo i don't think Faker is coaching he's gonna play till he can't physically and mentally
[0:33:49] immortalis202: @MilkPlease just because ghost is not a flashy player a lot of people consider him bad

[0:34:53] arionexus: okay then you could see 2021 wcs again with his irelia game
[0:34:58] immortalis202: @arionexus u have seen just 9 game in a year and you claim that he can't be better
[0:35:03] maniacoakz: Ghost is so good his team would rather have Showmaker play ADC and Canyon play mid than play Ghost KEKW

[0:36:16] arionexus: 9 games enough to see his potential unlike zeus and doran
[0:36:41] HideWithMonkey: Lol, ghost fits DK playstyle. He is by no meams the top ADC, but pro games and your gold soloq are 2 things
[0:36:45] salmanbinmahfooz: guys when we will see the new EDG skins ?
