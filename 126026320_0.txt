[1:21:42] Worldie: @Sov25, well what I mean is, even when they have mids that are relevant, if their botlane is completely useless (cough cough Wildturtle) they tend to lose anyway due to enemy just camping bot to snowball

[6:42:39] tr4dy: you can't just say "hey he solo killed so he is better", it depends on a lot of thing.. when febi killed faker twice, he had a good matchup and got team help (warding, pressure, etc), maybe if you gave bjerg the same adv, he could do it too

[6:51:48] tr4dy: bengi had really bad seasons too, and i personally don't care at all about blank so i'm not getting triggerd or anything, just finding hilarious that some bronze players allow themselves to call others "trash" when they aren't even 1/10 of them

[6:52:39] vic830710: @tanbir1997 just find another 1-hour game where rumble can freefire in every teamfight and watch his dmg output FailFish he did well with some awesome mid-game tp, but not that much about teamfight skill
