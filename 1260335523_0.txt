[0:27:22] Reijm11: America had a new record of over a milion in a day yeah

[0:27:24] ChaosBlaze: thats the holidays catching up to us
[0:27:25] Saryuken: Desepticron attacked
[0:27:25] EightBitDelight: @AinzN And the fact that its -25C outside and I can't walk the dog so he's going nuts and keeping me from work is not helping
[0:27:28] Blackmarsh: @itmeJP In norway 6000 infected a day is alot
[0:27:28] rypta: new high score!
[0:27:30] summerspeak: Reported cases, infections are probably 2-3x that much.

[0:27:43] Atorxke: 2022 on a down slide already
[0:27:46] Shoaron: KKona Clap
[0:27:47] DagooX: it's because the delayed reporting from the holidays
[0:27:58] Puretaz: UK has it high as well people seem to have given up on it

[0:28:04] OnePunchMac: What about that PIG HEART @itmeJP
[0:28:10] ritchie313: not reporting not testing just terrible

[0:28:15] Shoaron: time to countered hypeE
[0:28:16] AinzN: EightBitDelight I didn't have to deal with any of that stuff. I just stayed in bed and slept LUL
[0:28:19] fruit_of_doom: I believe in you
[0:28:20] Mattt_CE: Whaaat
[0:28:21] Sir_Nerdly: If South Africa and Europe's trends hold, we should see a dip again in about 2 weeks. Unfortunately, deaths are increasing right now.
[0:28:21] Systemic66: first pick top is fun
[0:28:21] Marc326: it is Tahm Pog
[0:28:24] Shrimp_Parm: I've had it for about a week. currently fighting Sadge
[0:28:29] Mattt_CE: Man-Pig
[0:28:33] RlDennis: Tahm is a relatively safe first pick because he's.. kinda low-econ?
[0:28:35] ghostwind32: I hope they dont go bacon his heart...
[0:28:37] cyberronic: a genetically altered pig heart
[0:28:43] DD_The_Shmey: makes me think about the movie Babe, the pig with a heart of gold
[0:28:46] Blackmarsh: Man bear pig is real Pog
[0:28:47] Darkaros: Shrimp_Parm Hop you get well soon ijpLOVE
[0:28:49] l1ttlelechuga: now he just needs bear arms to become man-bear-pig
[0:28:51] OnePunchMac: Man pig or pig man ????
[0:28:52] cyberronic: YEP
[0:28:54] JonnyFiveO: Just needs a kidney from a bear for Manbear Pig!
[0:28:54] Reijm11: No he needs a bear kidney and he will be man-bear-pig
[0:29:00] EightBitDelight: @AinzN I could have calling sick but working from home and fresh back from 3 weeks off, I felt bad haha
[0:29:00] Ciefon: it was a human heart grown on a pig I believe
[0:29:03] fruit_of_doom: pig fart
[0:29:07] PointlessP0tat0: I wonder how that works, like does it function like a normal heart? does he need extra things?
[0:29:07] Shrimp_Parm: @darkaros thank you friend.
[0:29:09] MasqureMan: His relationship with bacon has changed
[0:29:09] PointlessP0tat0: its cool af
[0:29:12] Gliverz: werepig
[0:29:13] MrTrotty: it had to be altered so the body wouldnt reject it
[0:29:16] Darkaros: Pig-man-heart
[0:29:17] Shoaron: that's coo laf
[0:29:17] Atorxke: a heart with no shame
[0:29:18] RlDennis: Wait, ON a pig?
[0:29:21] Saryuken: Thats even more confusing
[0:29:24] Drnkn__Mnky: Would he now feel a certain way about eating bacon now ?
[0:29:25] ChaosBlaze: it was a gene-altered pig heart
[0:29:30] Marcloure: Oh, does she say "shapeshifter at the masquerade"?
[0:29:30] aejeh: how do you grow a heart?
[0:29:30] epicshoo: just tossed a heart on the pig?
[0:29:34] Tronix_604: so if he eats bacon, is it cannibalism?
[0:29:35] Zaelsus: We have the Man, we have the Pig, all we're missing is the Bear! LUL
[0:29:36] AinzN: @EightBitDelight yeah I would have felt bad as well
[0:29:40] Darkaros: stripUgg Grow human heart on pig. Take heart. Young one. stripUgg
[0:29:48] ChiZWorkshop: good start
[0:29:50] EightBitDelight: Will he feel bad eating bacon tho?
[0:29:52] DagooX: pig is the closes to the human genome
[0:29:54] PointlessP0tat0: do yall think the new james webb telescope in space will discover some weird new shit in the universe? xD
[0:29:55] Systemic66: how balanced is league nowadays?
[0:30:00] roflrabbit: zomg
[0:30:03] ChaosBlaze: lies
[0:30:04] xhriiis: that is always the right decision
[0:30:05] MayhemMooseS97: someone clip tjat
[0:30:06] Zaelsus: That Ez is probably in for a surprise
[0:30:06] Mattt_CE: /mute all exists too
[0:30:06] ZcottD: lets see how long that lasts
[0:30:06] OnePunchMac: Genetically modified Pig heart. Give me the creeps. Why I don't know
[0:30:06] Systemic66: big Pog if true
[0:30:07] Faaux: Kekw
[0:30:09] Marc326: "at Poe's masquerade" even supposedly from a poem
[0:30:09] cyberronic: ijpEZ
[0:30:09] ghostwind32: Make that a bet, LUL
[0:30:10] Gutbro9: LUL
[0:30:11] Tronmakers: how about emotes?
[0:30:12] Scientist__: KEKW
[0:30:13] Shoaron: I smells lies Hmm
[0:30:14] AinzN: Can we get that as a prediction?
[0:30:14] xseaka: Just only type positive things!
[0:30:15] Madracah: great idea
[0:30:15] DD_The_Shmey: Has anyone ever seen that series by "The Onion" called "Porkin across America" ???
[0:30:17] k0jak: prediction: will jp talk to his team ijpHMM
[0:30:17] Darkaros: League seems way more dynamic (in terms of roles and champ diversity) than I expected/remembered it being
[0:30:18] JustLetItBe: I give it 2 games
[0:30:18] ritchie313: mute all = tilt free Kappa
[0:30:21] ChiZWorkshop: How's Trundle?
[0:30:22] jmj1987: how you have grown JP
[0:30:22] KatjeMauw: but.....but how do you shit on them then!? that not natural man! Kappa
[0:30:24] GameOnlyNoTalk: ohhh can we get a gamba on him not typing LUL
[0:30:26] cyberronic: where's the channel bet?
[0:30:27] Lettz: need a Gamba on that statement
[0:30:27] DD_The_Shmey: the person in that show had a heart transplant from a pig
[0:30:30] JonnyFiveO: Completely balanced games are boring.
[0:30:31] KonikMiejski: As balanced as a game with 150+ Champs can be
[0:30:32] Shoaron: get a prediction going " Will JP yell at his team"
[0:30:34] Acheron13: 100 legends all perfectly balanced
[0:30:36] Skyform: 10 total bans for a roster of hundreds of champs.. so pretty balance *smirk*
[0:30:40] RlDennis: That's kinda rough no?
[0:30:47] Tronix_604: league has always been pretty balanced, it's the people in control that make it unbalanced
[0:30:49] Systemic66: @GameOnPantsOff because you've played so many of those to know?
[0:30:50] crescens22: Is it cause you're silenced?lol
[0:30:50] MayhemMooseS97: Id love to see a bet on if JP will type to team today
[0:30:57] kosarkislev: pretty sure its Trundle top and Jax jungle
[0:31:00] AinzN: Shoaron got to go all in on "No" as everyone will go "yes" Get that big money!
[0:31:00] Jormunduur: It was definitely a genetically altered pig heart transplanted from a pig.
[0:31:03] Devlind: A while back I decided to mute toxic people in dota and my enjoyment went up. Its like they are not there.
[0:31:06] k0jak: it's a bit too long term tbh

[0:31:15] Skyform: he trolling the asshole
[0:31:15] GameOnlyNoTalk: he trollin
[0:31:16] RlDennis: He's just riling him up
[0:31:18] Notenoughcoffee: LUL
[0:31:27] Systemic66: what is the punishment for dodging?
[0:31:27] Mattt_CE: lol thats brilliant
[0:31:31] The_Faceless_Void: instamute that fucker
[0:31:35] Darkaros: oh this is only one game
[0:31:37] Poobzee: oh up to b2 now
[0:31:38] The_Faceless_Void: modCheck
[0:31:41] AinzN: Do it game by game
[0:31:47] Shoaron: AinzN ye read my mind Hmm
[0:31:47] MasqureMan: League players lowering expectations from the moment it starts
[0:31:55] IAmBarboodith: bronze player threatening to dodge an iron player is hilarious
[0:31:55] AinzN: You can have 3 predictions going at once no?
[0:31:55] roflrabbit: Jax again? The most challenging of heroes...
[0:31:56] Frostberry: NotLikeThis
[0:32:00] Systemic66: wow chat has NO faith
[0:32:00] a6314: HACKERMANS
[0:32:07] k0jak: i reallllly wish they would do multiple predictions
[0:32:09] RlDennis: cohhM Trundle vs a tank
[0:32:10] Darkaros: no AinzN only one at a time
[0:32:10] Neragsito: interesting prediction
[0:32:11] k0jak: i'll take 3
[0:32:17] k0jak: you cannot
[0:32:20] k0jak: only one
[0:32:20] IkomaTomoya: It's to early for this gamba, League hasn't been going long enough yet stripHmm
[0:32:30] Darkaros: I will say that I'm pleasantly surprised at how FB -> first tower -> win game? prediction rotation is going
[0:32:30] RlDennis: @itmeJP Just asking, but do you know what Trundle ult does?
[0:32:34] Kasires: Hello everyone. Can someone enlighten a pleb and tell me how one goes about getting an animated background like JP's? is that steam app thing?
[0:32:36] Shoaron: ah fck the percentage flipped right when I was betting NotLikeThis
[0:32:36] jmj1987: Clap
[0:32:37] k0jak: as evidenced by my complete inability to start more predictions
[0:32:42] Darkaros: IkomaTomoya bet doubt then :) it's only for one game
[0:32:42] epicshoo: MYAAA
[0:32:47] Zaelsus: I've seen channels do at least 2, maybe only 1 active for voting at a time>
[0:32:47] Skyform: Skyform subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 81 months! ijpSUFFER
[0:32:47] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Skyform! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:32:49] PointlessP0tat0: what app do you use to display info and stats on the champs and game?
[0:32:53] Darkaros: !wallpaper Kasires
[0:32:54] itmeBOT: @Kasires JP uses Wallpaper Engine (from Steam)! Currently he's using "Center Point".
[0:32:57] Darkaros: !app
[0:32:57] itmeBOT: JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[0:32:58] k0jak: wallpaper engine
[0:33:06] Hylotras: thats a lot of ashe without improving it seems xD
[0:33:10] ChaosBlaze: im forever stuck in iron 1 this season....my team rolls have been horrid sigh
[0:33:11] Kasires: Thank you!
[0:33:19] AinzN: Shoaron I'll vote yes and help you out bud ijpSMUG
[0:33:28] Blackmarsh: Are league loading times still slow as hell?
[0:33:31] RlDennis: I honestly wonder what rank I'd be put in because I haven't touched ranked since season 7
[0:33:35] Sir_Nerdly: The amount of league I've played while never improving is impressive
[0:33:38] IkomaTomoya: I believe JP will chat, but in a postive encouraging manner :)
[0:33:41] Mattt_CE: I want high gold this year. Highest ive been is S4
[0:33:52] Kasires: Loved Arcane but still would not have the courage to go into LoL :P
[0:33:57] camerongio1: I wonder what the metrics for laptop users are for league
[0:33:59] CastIronJake: @itmeJP I'd be one of them, though i only play aram right now
[0:34:03] Systemic66: me :)
[0:34:04] Jormunduur: LUL
[0:34:07] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[0:34:11] CastIronJake: *and not a pc even just a laptop surface
[0:34:11] hawkdsr: i only want to get gold to get the victorius skin
[0:34:13] MrTrotty: When did they go back on the all chat removal?
[0:34:14] Unodamuffinman: youre against trundle
[0:34:17] Unodamuffinman: tho
[0:34:19] Genostar0: jax loses early
[0:34:19] Unodamuffinman: i htink
[0:34:24] Gliverz: You need to ask your teammates about it :D
[0:34:24] Zaelsus: I remember the time we could see everyone's loading %, so you can see who has the toaster/potato machine
[0:34:24] MasqureMan: There‚Äôs also some obscure audio bugs with League that can mess stuff up
[0:34:24] RlDennis: @Kasires It's like a team of frieends kinda thing to attempt to get into it LUL
[0:34:27] SkylerKK: I can confirm when I worked in IT at a University we played it on old computers. I mean like year 2000 computers. Game ran at a smooth 55 fps though.
[0:34:28] RlDennis: You're against Trundle
[0:34:29] roflrabbit: one does not simply dodge the tongue twister
[0:34:32] Darkaros: I wonder if LoL will ever cut off support for toasters. Sometimes I still giggle at someone unironically mad that FFXIV cut off x32 support
[0:34:33] HellForgeTV: LoL is alright as long as you mute all in-game communication. That tends to make it less toxic
[0:34:35] Biuregard: I liked it when you could see who loaded the slowest. But that could cause people to be toxic
[0:34:39] BlueSapphyre: @MrTrotty it only lasted like a week. people complained.
[0:34:43] RlDennis: @itmeJP Trundle ultimate steals tank stats.
[0:34:45] ritchie313: till 6 when he gets his busted ult
[0:34:46] Shoaron: Trundle is gonna fc your W up every time with his pillar if he's good
[0:34:48] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @itmeJP  wait doesn't trundle counter you
[0:34:51] Lutcha81: how long is a season ?
[0:34:52] MellonFarm: If Trundle goes bork you get cucked pretty hard
[0:34:54] Rdei: Trundle is super anti-tank
[0:35:00] Skyform: i don't know how to play against Jax with tahm cause of his dodge.
[0:35:06] AinzN: Tahm is uncounterable!
[0:35:07] Skyform: can't stack
[0:35:10] johnfive21: ijpHI Jp, ijpHI Chat
[0:35:16] Darkaros: tahm's only counter is global warming ending his natural habitat
[0:35:16] Marcloure: @camerongio1 I believe it must be pretty high. It's one of the few games that can run smoothly enough in laptops
[0:35:18] AinzN: johnfive21 ijpHI
[0:35:20] Catzumo: @Lutcha81 from jan to oct ish
[0:35:29] bogidude17: The only counter is a bad team
[0:35:32] johnfive21: ooh we running P5 playlist today? p5JAM

[0:51:01] Darkaros: @Pistollero1 You should watch some Switch gameplay. But basically Rise is a different kind of dumb (and better-dumb IMO) where there's basically a single player (easy as sin mode) and multiplayer (actual content) campaign and you can fully coop the MP

[0:53:10] Darkaros: @Pistollero1 The *only* bad thing about Rise's multiplayer functionality (since again it's fully coopable and that's where the "meat" of the game is) is that the singleplayer village quests locks some nifty QoL content that's MP-applicable and you want to finish it ASAP for some dumb tickets that literally are only from singleplayer and are useful for an early-meta helmet

[0:56:20] PangurBanTheCat: True AF. Trundle will be banging away on the Nexus when nobody is looking. They always do, somehow.
[0:56:24] GrievAY: Wait we on the Kench training now? ijpCHEER ijpPOGGERS ijpSIP
[0:56:26] individuali: did they have someone leave?

[0:56:52] Pistollero1: Trundle used to have suc h a cool backstory, but then they changed it for some reason into a very generic ice troll backstory, no idea why
[0:56:54] PenguinLore: and he won't kill him in the time he absorbs the stats - he pretty much needs to go through 2 hp bars
[0:57:11] Darkaros: hypeE "SHUTDOWN"

[0:58:19] Darkaros: Matt_2677 I explained it in-depth early (you might be able to scroll up) but basically there's a singleplayer-only campaign that's a joke, and a MP campaign that's decent in size. But about equal to launch World

[1:17:45] onehandmostly: it puts a debuf on you if your clone dies or walk out of the circle
[1:17:46] Haeher: good trade there was no way out of that
[1:17:46] RlDennis: Yeah, jungle backed after krugs. didn't see a gank opportunity
[1:17:47] HorrorShowXXXL: good moves jp
[1:17:58] Rdei: at release you could fight her to remove the effect early, but now its just better to move out of range and deal with the tentacles
[1:18:03] wagah: wagah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Keep up the awesome job of grinding LOL it's a pain in the ass. But i'm in it together with ya. Having the same trouble

[1:19:09] The_Faceless_Void: Wait is this the same duo bot as last game? ez and xerath?
[1:19:19] MasqureMan: I still think Diana is so busted
[1:19:23] larkhill: @The_Faceless_Void different. just a coincidence
[1:19:27] RlDennis: She used it yeah
[1:19:27] Skyform: she used it
[1:19:28] keogg: she used it yea
[1:19:31] freka_man: yes she did
[1:19:32] afreak10: ye
[1:19:35] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP its a small and makes her Q faster
[1:19:35] IkomaTomoya: Tentacle Slam Jam
[1:19:38] FyreAshbane: monkaS
[1:19:46] Joebeezer: monkaS
[1:19:47] afreak10: ijpMONKA
[1:19:48] Hopsinka: monkaS
[1:19:48] The_Faceless_Void: small? wtf was I typing
[1:19:49] RlDennis: She slams the ground, and in an AoE around her she spawns 1 tentacle per enemy hit (the ghost counting for 1 too)
[1:19:50] epicshoo: ijpMONKA
[1:19:52] futanahri_: monkaS
[1:19:52] Skyform: she slams the ground and any champ in the slam spawns tentacles.
[1:19:54] The_Faceless_Void: slam*
[1:19:55] ThemDemo: ijpD
[1:19:58] SchnellBier: she spawned a tentacle in your nose
[1:20:01] Kaleith: rip jp o7
[1:20:01] Darkaros: "YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN"
[1:20:02] Dr_Whoot: nose hair
[1:20:17] breadgravy: JP ever get nosehair trimmers? I remember you asked for recommendations awhile back.
[1:20:28] freka_man: when those 3 tentacles spawn from the ground and she w you get attack and if she manages to e you she also get heal
[1:20:29] RlDennis: Which gives her a ton of potential healing aswell. She can pop off in teamfights
[1:20:30] Joebeezer: run away there's a range
[1:20:31] The_Faceless_Void: walk out of the ring
[1:20:39] IkomaTomoya: You can break the range band I think
[1:20:42] freka_man: no you have to move away afar
[1:20:42] omgitsjason: just walk away when she R's
[1:20:47] blastboys123: if you walk out of the range you spawn tentacles tho
[1:20:49] johnfive21: yea but then you start spawning tentacles around you
[1:20:58] Sakkyoku: Man I really wish you could see enemy ability descriptions in game
[1:21:02] Sakkyoku: so stupid you can't
[1:21:05] RlDennis: It puts a debuff on you that spawns 2 tentacles after like.. 5--6 seconds?
[1:21:08] Skyform: you still spawn tentacles if you leave the range or she kills your ghost
[1:21:09] IkomaTomoya: If she kills the clone it spawns them around you fast
[1:21:12] vTwin_IndianScout: @itmeJP if you exceed the range you begin spawning tentacles
[1:21:12] RlDennis: 1 per few seconds
[1:21:19] battlexmonkee: If you know she can‚Äôt kill the clone then you can stay in range
[1:21:20] freka_man: yes it is
[1:21:28] battlexmonkee: If not then you should run
[1:21:28] Niwa_Rei: she deals damage based on max hp with her W
[1:21:33] keogg: yea illaoi is all about dodging the soul  pull
[1:21:35] blastboys123: she is annoyign but luckily shes not very good so she doesn tget played a lot

[1:22:06] xhriiis: if you dodge e she does nothing
[1:22:09] Skyform: her Q and E are skill shots
[1:22:11] igrcndd: buy bramble vest cause she is all about healing herself
[1:22:12] emi225: pretty much. which is why if u dodge E shes fucked
[1:22:12] futanahri_: she's a tank buster
[1:22:14] Skyform: so ppl are bad with her
[1:22:16] omgitsjason: because of the reasons you just listed lol
[1:22:17] TamboTv: to be fair its pretty easy dodge

[1:22:57] omgitsjason: stay behind creep
[1:22:58] freka_man: no u can stay behind minions
[1:22:58] Joebeezer: it's a line
[1:22:59] vTwin_IndianScout: it's like your tongue shot
[1:23:00] RlDennis: She missed it a few times
[1:23:00] AN71V1RU5: it's a skillshot
[1:23:01] Miracleshot: its a straight line
[1:23:02] freka_man: is like blitz q

[1:23:10] Necrocosm: no it's a skillshot
[1:23:17] epicshoo: not sure if it's been said but it's a skillshot üì£
[1:23:17] rHakkar: @Dr_Whoot old but gold it seens, new to lol here
[1:23:19] johnfive21: It's very hard for her to miss or you to dodge that skillshot
[1:23:21] DrewGamer: I'm not 100% sure chat, but I think it's a skillshot cohhK
[1:23:21] GrievAY: It is a skillshot, but she uses it when she is close to u so hard to see
[1:23:23] RlDennis: Yeah, you kinda wanna go in on her after she misses it
[1:23:30] battlexmonkee: Cus you‚Äôre at point blank when she does it
[1:23:30] Necrocosm: and it's not hard to land
[1:23:33] Kev_Bo23: kench is also a big target
[1:23:43] Rave_Digger: Thats why she gets so close to you because she cant land it otherwise LUL
[1:23:45] AN71V1RU5: it's a generous skillshot, but still a skillshot
[1:23:52] rubxcubedude: jp saved her
[1:23:56] johnfive21: that was HAM
[1:23:57] RlDennis: You could've spat her out into Nunu's ult
[1:23:58] Joebeezer: you could have thrown it in the ult
[1:24:05] Joebeezer: hbd
[1:24:08] Joebeezer: nbd
[1:24:13] Miracleshot: LUL
[1:24:14] freka_man: yes

[1:24:28] Insigmada: fuck nunu
[1:24:31] DrewGamer: LOL
[1:24:33] Haeher: no but good to know YEP
[1:24:41] johnfive21: I don't know about that JP. I think maybe if you spat her out into Nunu's ult
[1:24:43] Sakkyoku: Didn't they change the name from nunu to something dumb?
[1:24:49] PepperFTW: Really nice just pushing her hard if she does hit the pull on you, some scenarios there you pushed her off your soul, real good.
[1:24:49] Ajrags13: you could have spat that into nunu's ult
[1:24:51] PangurBanTheCat: If everyone had a chat when playing games I think people would just stop playing games... lol
[1:24:52] captain_doggy: No you want the kill so u miss the nunu
[1:24:52] RlDennis: @Sakkyoku Nunu and Willump
[1:24:52] Tronmakers: I dont even know what a nunu is
[1:24:53] MasqureMan: HahaThink
[1:24:53] Samstein: nunu was dumb to use his ult there anyways
[1:24:55] Kev_Bo23: just ult it into your throw YEP
[1:25:01] GrittzNGravy: no i dont play this game but thanks for the pro tips :)
[1:25:06] futanahri_: 4Head
[1:25:08] Joebeezer: you are fat
[1:25:09] RlDennis: It's about the same speed as Tahm Q no?
[1:25:10] freka_man: stay behind minions
[1:25:13] Altair900: Is this where Im supposed to insert a Nunu deez nuts joke or no?
[1:25:14] keogg: sit in your minion wave
[1:25:16] hitbox_royal_rabbit: Korean advice "just don't get hit."
[1:25:16] aznhai: it gets blocked by minions as well
[1:25:19] Joebeezer: it's tough
[1:25:25] SoulCrusher842: Just flash it Kappa
[1:25:26] DrewGamer: It's going to be hard as TK because his hitbox is big. Especially since you only have Boots 1
[1:25:32] Necrocosm: lyou have tier 1 boots, that doesn't help mate
[1:25:42] PepperFTW: If you do not dodge it and want to trade her, just push hard after she pulls you, so she does not focus your soul.
[1:25:43] AN71V1RU5: the important thing to always remember is that chat are all former pros who can play every champ or else challenger players who one trick the champ you are playing @itmejp
[1:25:45] wikes60: Basically its the same as your Q
[1:25:53] Ekoki: maybe don't leave the circle
[1:25:54] zymioi: chat not understanding itmejp sarcasm NotLikeThis
[1:26:00] SoulCrusher842: I'll have you all know I am a pro Iron 1
[1:26:01] RlDennis: Is she building divine sunderer?
[1:26:07] prrrah123: KEKW
[1:26:08] futanahri_: Kappa
[1:26:11] johnfive21: that missed I swear ..
[1:26:13] layn2321: When you run out of the circle range, it will spawn a tentacle near you
[1:26:13] xhriiis: KEKW
[1:26:16] DrewGamer: @Ekoki staying in the circle is really bad because she amps her damage to him while he's in it.
[1:26:20] hitbox_royal_rabbit: it can be creep blocked, your best bet is that
[1:26:20] Mina_the_Engineer: nope, you're too chonky
[1:26:24] Haeher: you might be too big
[1:26:31] tommy_cop: don't destroy the tenticles that are far away and aren't bothering you, then they won't respawn where it's more useful for her
[1:26:33] vTwin_IndianScout: Tham a thicc boy
[1:26:39] battlexmonkee: Yeah he a big boi
[1:26:46] BbreakGaming: But JP.. Chat said to dodge it bro KEKW ijpNODDERS

[1:26:54] loki15kun: I wonder if she is hiding the skill shot somehow
[1:26:59] Dr_Whoot: they might main Illaoi
[1:27:06] The_Faceless_Void: kayne modCheck
[1:27:11] The_Faceless_Void: jungler modCheck

[1:27:26] futanahri_: huge ult

[1:27:51] MasqureMan: They heard you
[1:27:51] Skyform: i do love the eat illaoi out of her ult move
[1:27:52] aznhai: the classic league saying "complain about it and ye shall receive"
[1:27:54] Sha1yen: rooSit
[1:27:54] battlexmonkee: Wow that wombo combo
[1:27:55] loki15kun: RlDennis For me it's really hard to see it
[1:27:56] Shoaron: AinzN i'm almost our of silver but the climb is backbreaking coxNotThatDrunk
[1:27:59] DrewGamer: actually that ult to cancel her ult was pretty PogBones
[1:28:04] Sakkyoku: assist POG
[1:28:08] Joebeezer: a nunu that's not feeding?!
[1:28:11] GrievAY: Damn Kench could use to loose a few pounds, but him on a diet ijpLAUGH
[1:28:14] Rdei: pop goes the Diana
[1:28:15] ParaSycthe: That was really good ult
[1:28:16] AinzN: Shoaron that means its almost ice cream time for you! ijpH
[1:28:22] johnfive21: Tahm can't take anyone with him on the journey anymore can he?
[1:28:26] Ekoki: just hit her and eat her if she takes your body @itmeJP
[1:28:30] RlDennis: @loki15kun It's just the pulling motion she does. It doesn't really have any flashy animations other than a tentacle lashing out ttowards him
[1:28:33] Shoaron: AinzN out of Brz*
[1:28:37] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:28:45] RlDennis: @loki15kun So when JP is close to her, you'll barely see the animatio
[1:28:53] AinzN: Shoaron ok you can have a small ice cream cone for that
[1:29:05] loki15kun: RlDennis I saw it. damn that is quick
[1:29:05] Shoaron: AinzN hypeE
[1:29:07] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[1:29:08] Ekoki: there you go
[1:29:11] Laurix246: Believe in yourself that believes in you that can block/dodge that!
[1:29:21] Ekoki: she ulted that time
[1:29:23] RlDennis: @loki15kun Yeah, it's maybe only a tiny fraction slower than Tahm's Q
[1:29:24] k0jak: ok kamina
[1:29:32] Kev_Bo23: jp too clean with it
[1:29:34] Sha1yen: It's really not. While it is fairly wide, it's more a matter of baiting it, than dodging it
[1:29:41] Laurix246: Fun fact: I disliked that anime quite a bit lol
[1:29:56] Laurix246: But somehow that's the only thing that popped in my mind for the moment
[1:30:06] DrewGamer: he is owning other places on the map to be fair
[1:30:13] zymioi: @Laurix246 odd take
[1:30:16] RlDennis: @loki15kun JP is making himself a little vulnerable by using his W though because he's showing where he's gonna land. But that's just something that comes with experience
[1:30:26] Sha1yen: double low dmg melee is NOT what you wanna fight illaoi with though
[1:30:29] layn2321: at least they're doing good work in the other lanes
[1:30:31] Darkaros: MmmHmm JP's team is leading, but who's winning, prediction up
[1:30:35] Sha1yen: So as much as it sucks, your jungler is doing the right thing
[1:30:36] tommy_cop: is it me or are NA players more chill that EU players
[1:30:41] RlDennis: @Darkaros Was that prediction prior to this one about which team got first tower?
[1:30:42] tommy_cop: than
[1:30:49] Darkaros: first top* tower RlDennis
[1:30:55] DrewGamer: @tommy_cop you haven't seen me play cohhK
[1:31:05] Laurix246: EU has more languages to swear in
[1:31:08] Shoaron: Riot needs to tweak the bonus gold for the losing team a bit cuz there are way too many comeback games recently
[1:31:08] RlDennis: @Darkaros Alright, was about to say that JP's team got bot tower first.
[1:31:16] loki15kun: RlDennis Cool. thanks for the info.
[1:31:25] tommy_cop: @tommy_cop hehehe, JP is a good role model

[1:31:55] tommy_cop: if this was EU servers the chat would be a cest pit of hate
[1:31:56] RlDennis: @loki15kun np
[1:31:57] DrewGamer: @GrievAY cohhChaos
[1:31:58] johnfive21: so much healing even through bramble monkaS
[1:32:02] Sha1yen: @itmeJP want a TLDR about illaoi from a 500k point main?
[1:32:12] Joebeezer: jp tilted so far the other day that he untilted himself
[1:32:16] Genostar0: Tahm kench eats tentacles for breakfast
[1:32:17] Rave_Digger: Just gotta yank her away from all her tentacles and she's an easy kill 4Head

[1:34:04] almoexe: or its the best bait in the world, no one expecting blitz hook Kappa
[1:34:13] Tronmakers: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3
[1:34:18] RlDennis: @EightBitDelight Yes, but there may be lower LP losses
[1:34:48] EightBitDelight: thx
[1:34:49] afreak10: that dmg
[1:34:55] Kaleith: they almost died
[1:34:57] Darkaros: ijpHMM I think I saw a highlight of a Illaio 1 v 5 and I think they too sat in tentacles
[1:35:00] RlDennis: The more people Illaoi is fighting, the deadlier she becomes

[1:35:22] battlexmonkee: Stay clear of the tentacles‚Ä¶ they give her LifeSteal
[1:35:30] Haeher: @RlDennis do you have to report that or does the game notice if a player char doesnt move rooIsee

[1:36:01] BurdTheWurd: "yet"
[1:36:33] RlDennis: @RlDennis Not sure entirely sure how it's determined. I just know there's a system in place that reduces LP losses incase of an afk. (Might also look at the exp earned by champion in-game)
[1:36:48] Joebeezer: he's dancing
[1:36:55] Rdei: cats eating electrons
[1:36:55] epicshoo: he's charging up monkaSTEER

[1:37:36] wikes60: They have a nasty wombo combo potential
[1:37:37] RlDennis: It's not as if you'd go from losing 17 LP to only 2 LP or something, but more along the lines of -14 LP @Haeher It doesn't reduce the losses by too much otherwise It might get abused in some way ofcourse
[1:37:46] Darkaros: wb psychic_ward ijpHI
[1:37:59] Haeher: yeah that does make sense
[1:38:00] wikes60: Swain Ult, Illaoi Ult, MF Ult,
[1:38:04] Opoppopro: there is an afk warning if you stand still for 2-3 min so yeah the game does know if a char doesn't move

[1:48:20] Lutcha81: @itmeJP there is several Tahm kench wallpapers in wallpaper engine, even one as a chef, its only 1080p tho
[1:48:32] Eplesh: dont you get -3lp or is that not a thing anymore?
[1:48:37] RlDennis: Didn't dodging cause like -5LP but no change to your MMR or something
[1:48:39] camdunne: You definitely lose LP for dodging
[1:48:44] Haeher: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3 river king wallpaper
[1:48:50] Altair900: yes you do
[1:48:52] GuacaWaka: there is a penalty
[1:48:55] DrewGamer: MMR doesn't change though right?
[1:48:56] Achubra: you lose lp but not mmr
[1:48:56] Altair900: it counts as a loss
[1:48:56] blastboys123: the first dodge per day is free
[1:48:58] Muffnar: u lose 3 lp
[1:49:00] imlolday: yeah its -3

[1:49:15] zymioi: @itmeJP side note did u see the clip where tyler1 drops his ice cream the scream kills it for me
[1:49:16] Achubra: better than taking a loss and losing mmr
[1:49:23] imlolday: first dodge of the day is -3lp, second is -10lp
[1:49:25] RlDennis: If it's a definite loss, it's worth the 3 LP loss to make sure your MMR isn't messed up I guess
[1:49:25] johnfive21: @Darkaros ijpNODDERS
[1:49:29] camdunne: @Shoaron it increases the more you dodge

[2:25:07] Fiendmaw: Would have worked if trundle didn't tp back
[2:25:17] Azathul: i like top cause it feels more like a 1v1 situation, unless their jungle camps you hard
[2:25:19] Samc27: Helping you push into turret without threat of engage
[2:25:25] heckin_majestic: prob assumed he tp the first time back

[2:46:35] kounounou: Ez overstayed as always
[2:46:36] afreak10: losing yeah
[2:46:37] Joebeezer: throwing
[2:46:47] rubxcubedude: getting kills but no objectives
[2:46:53] Poobzee: getting a lil too confident
[2:46:54] jingosaurus: ryze can split he has TP and his ult
[2:46:57] Athleon: shaco falling off in these teamfights
[2:46:58] Ahoy_NATO: you should defo get FoN for Ahri and WW
[2:47:04] kounounou: Ryze cant split because he is bad xD
[2:47:05] Fiendmaw: Look at the tower difference
[2:47:16] kounounou: He cant match anybody
[2:47:18] Fiendmaw: Your team didnt do much with those kills
[2:47:22] ScholarGoblin: Thanks for streaming LoL JP. It's been great to watch during recovery!
[2:47:35] afreak10: lets 5 , continuing to split
[2:47:38] BlurredVision18: Luckily Red went too ham under turret, could have been worse for blue team
[2:47:43] kounounou: Your jungler is top wtf
[2:47:48] PenguinLore: shaco not very good at jungling based on his positioning
[2:47:49] kounounou: This elo is triggering me
[2:48:12] mrmosbka: gg
[2:48:12] jingosaurus: no point trying to steal just wasting time pretty much shaco is top for some reason
[2:48:17] Darkaros: that was a lot of damage ijpHAHA
[2:48:19] PangurBanTheCat: ....whoever voted lose is about to have a huge payout lmao
[2:48:20] Fiendmaw: NODDERS
[2:48:22] Athleon: oh sthit thats a soul
[2:48:23] crustyy_: the 7 doubters will win big :O
[2:48:28] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: that was soul
[2:48:28] Xazarl_: the kills is 33-18
[2:48:31] JimB0b0: The shaco lost the game right there
[2:48:36] BlurredVision18: and there's the mistake, and Trundle too deep to stop, as I mentioned earlier LUL
[2:48:38] Fiendmaw: Trundle used the fact that he was 0-7
[2:48:42] Xazarl_: ur suposed to be holding trundle tho jp
[2:48:51] Xazarl_: you have tp
[2:48:52] mrmosbka: BIGBRAIN
[2:48:56] Pistollero1: Trundle push top always was the play apparently
[2:48:59] rubxcubedude: but doubled the ce
[2:49:01] kounounou: Your Shaco is the classic low elo junglers that ganks a lot and gets lots of kills but totally ignores objectives and is constantly at the wrong place
[2:49:08] heckin_majestic: not the first time shaco has been far from the objective
[2:49:08] captain_doggy: Trolling ithk not... Kinda
[2:49:11] BulletParry: it's bronze game it's not gonna til minute 50 anyway LUL
[2:49:18] afreak10: its over
[2:49:27] Azathul: Trundle a trk2g sub
[2:49:34] BlurredVision18: ^^^
[2:49:39] BlurredVision18: gates wins game
[2:49:43] jingosaurus: go top
[2:49:46] Darkaros: drag + 2 towers top was probably the turning point, they got so much gold after starving
[2:49:47] jingosaurus: look at that wave
[2:49:50] Ahoy_NATO: dude low elo games not ending is wild to me, these games last forever
[2:49:54] Cardsharp: Hey Jp and Chat! How is everyone!?
[2:50:11] Darkaros: Cardsharp ijpHI
[2:50:16] ZMightyCheeba: 3-0 PogChamp challenger incoming PogChamp
[2:50:27] Fiendmaw: Also your team damage is mostly AP no?
[2:50:28] CommanderBearded: Cardsharp Hello!
[2:50:37] afreak10: bot trundle
[2:50:48] Joebeezer: tele top
[2:50:49] jingosaurus: trundleee
[2:50:49] MasqureMan: @ahoy_nato people don‚Äôt usually know how to take advantage of objectives in low elo. Makes sense
[2:50:52] Darkaros: stripUgg I trundle I hit bottom
[2:50:56] Joebeezer: nooooooo
[2:51:01] mrmosbka: trundle too good for this game
[2:51:07] captain_doggy: The pusher of objectives
[2:51:09] afreak10: LUL
[2:51:13] PangurBanTheCat: That... actually is insane
[2:51:14] jingosaurus: he has hullbreaker
[2:51:16] SabertoothEwok: Its the hullbreaker
[2:51:19] TPLivewire: Trundle is super broken
[2:51:20] jingosaurus: when hes alone hes much stronger
[2:51:26] kounounou: He is not that busted, you let him free farm and push for a very long time
[2:51:26] Ahoy_NATO: he ult'd you and you build a ton of Res
[2:51:27] ShadowsparksTV: Hullbreaker is helping a lot.
[2:51:28] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: He got soul so you can't beat him
[2:51:34] MasqureMan: Trundle bought a new keyboard instead of breaking his earlier
[2:51:34] PenguinLore: assume he went hullbreaker?
[2:51:46] mrmosbka: soul > everything
[2:51:53] Felgrun: He just has a really good gaming chair
[2:51:57] Azulyian: y'all let him split push and farm. your shaco failed you
[2:52:10] Fiendmaw: Shows you the value of objectives
[2:52:16] Nathrael: shaco late is trash unfortunately, he doesn't scale at all
[2:52:17] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @itmeJP  soul + hullbreaker. you can't beak trundle
[2:52:20] plata: is this the master chef meta?
[2:52:29] Joebeezer: regroup and get vision
[2:52:35] BlurredVision18: Split Pusher split pushes, NODDERS
[2:52:39] Ahoy_NATO: what should have happened was the once lane phase was over, Ryze would split vs him and win and force everyone on enemy to go to him, but shaco/ez were doing it
[2:52:42] kounounou: Shaco could have been assasinating Ahri and Samira, but he doesnt know what he is doing
[2:52:43] captain_doggy: Ok hear me out... Robot trundles that just push top for you
[2:52:49] afreak10: top trundle
[2:52:59] ShadowsparksTV: Trundle is just going to keep split pushing.
[2:53:02] Darkaros: nah trundle is full stripUgg "i spleet poosh" atm
[2:53:06] skaugne: no one went with ryze lol
[2:53:13] titanodin: Good evening chat and mods o/
[2:53:16] apartowicz: You jinxed it yourself
[2:53:18] afreak10: GG
[2:53:24] PangurBanTheCat: That is insane
[2:53:34] mrmosbka: JEBAITED
[2:53:45] galdamesh: think that was more luck then skill but...
[2:53:46] Felgrun: Trundle is cracked
[2:53:48] ZMightyCheeba: He knows his stuff
[2:53:53] s_k_o_m: smurf
[2:53:53] mrmosbka: it was feed tactics all along
[2:54:00] Nathrael: I legit think he just wanted to block your path, but lucked out because you pressed your skill at the same time
[2:54:01] BlurredVision18: @galdamesh it's map awareness
[2:54:05] Darkaros: stripUgg while you were farming me, i was farming towers
[2:54:13] afreak10: F
[2:54:14] titanodin: @Darkaros o/
[2:54:15] Pistollero1: 0-7 in lane, and now his just going crazy
[2:54:16] kounounou: What is that shaco doing
[2:54:17] kounounou: wtf
[2:54:20] ZMightyCheeba: What's the shaco doing???
[2:54:21] jingosaurus: shaco is a moron lmao
[2:54:22] Darkaros: titanodin ijpHI
[2:54:22] TPLivewire: He kinda inted there
[2:54:22] Loganok: skyrim tavern ambiance music, nice cohhBongos
[2:54:23] PenguinLore: shaco ignoring another dragon
[2:54:24] Ahoy_NATO: dude wtf is this shaco doing, he also seems to do no dmg
[2:54:25] galdamesh: @BlurredVision18 him interupting the tahm W was map awareness?
[2:54:26] TDotTerror: Shaco, pls.
[2:54:26] JimB0b0: that's the second time he has done that
[2:54:30] kounounou: He doesnt know how to play Shaco either
[2:54:31] izzyiv: dang the throws
[2:54:34] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: Your shaco is complete trash
[2:54:38] Felgrun: Deth
[2:54:42] captain_doggy: F
[2:54:44] kounounou: He has the reflexes of an 80 year old Grandma that shaco
[2:54:44] Joebeezer: that's game
[2:54:45] izzyiv: that sucks
[2:54:53] PangurBanTheCat: lol Wow.
[2:54:54] PenguinLore: was more shaco than trundle honestly
[2:54:57] roflrabbit: GG
[2:54:59] Joebeezer: I can see how shaco is bronze
[2:55:00] MasqureMan: He knows how to Shaco, he doesn‚Äôt know how to play past early game
[2:55:03] Elyoslayer: i mean it is bronze, and he is a shaco
[2:55:03] afreak10: LUL
[2:55:05] Ahoy_NATO: trundle is going to think you were BMing him
[2:55:05] mrmosbka: heheh
[2:55:06] Poobzee: shaco CHASING kills
[2:55:07] HellForgeTV: GG
[2:55:09] Cardsharp: !playlist
[2:55:09] itmeBOT: For a list of the songs JP plays on stream, head over to https://itme.jp/playlist
[2:55:12] afreak10: ur team lost all dragons
[2:55:23] PenguinLore: trundle could have easily cost them the game had shaco focused on objectives
[2:55:25] s_k_o_m: oof, he was trolling hard
[2:55:27] rubxcubedude: trundle more gold than jp
[2:55:28] JimB0b0: the shaco never showed up to any dragons
[2:55:30] BlurredVision18: @galdamesh I guess I misunderstood what you were saying, im talking about trundle pushing turrets while five are down mid
[2:55:34] m3rcer: KEKW
[2:55:36] Farnzy11: hahaah
[2:55:36] Felgrun: Ew

[2:55:43] P4ste: KEKW
[2:55:44] roflrabbit: trolled
[2:55:44] captain_doggy: Didn't capitalize on your advantage as a team got almost no objectives F
[2:55:47] DyingEros: Actual trash bag LUL
[2:55:53] Farnzy11: what a bum
[2:55:54] qyang1212: shaco just need to focus on objectives
[2:55:59] SlipCrit: skyrim?
[2:56:00] TPLivewire: I ran into 5 games yesterday where like half the team shared their twitch
[2:56:03] SlipCrit: the fuck
[2:56:04] Darkaros: ahh that's the skyrim i know, with the low poly items and character models
[2:56:07] KB__1: @itmeJP how appropriate would it be if we tried to add you on league?
[2:56:10] ZMightyCheeba: hopefully he doesn't know who ye are eh
[2:56:11] Pistollero1: Thought that one was in the bag after that laning phase but nice comeback on their part
[2:56:17] Distant13Ocean: for some reason the music makes me wanna go play Divinity Original Sin or pathfinder
[2:56:19] WiFi_802: !song

[2:56:27] afreak10: KEKLEO KEKLEO
[2:56:28] galdamesh: @BlurredVision18 no JP was saying his reaction time to stoping his W but it looked more like he was just trying to block the walk path and JP happaened to start W
[2:56:28] BlurredVision18: LUL
[2:56:28] captain_doggy: Game of decent mechanics but little game sense
[2:56:29] mrmosbka: ahha
[2:56:31] StarPogPlatinum: Yeah... when your username is the same as you stream PepeLaugh
[2:56:37] crustyy_: loot +208.736
[2:56:45] PangurBanTheCat: lmao that payout wow
[2:57:02] BlurredVision18: @galdamesh probably luck of timing, yes
[2:57:22] MasqureMan: League usually comes down to the difference between early laning and midgame objevtives and pressure
[2:57:54] MasqureMan: You can win lane and be real bad at team fighting
[2:58:01] jmj1987: !next
[2:58:01] itmeBOT: Upcoming Games/Events From https://JPedia.net: Monster Hunter Rise PC Release - Wednesday, January 12

[3:08:23] MasqureMan: Is it blood lord Vlad?
[3:08:37] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[3:08:39] OuroborosChemist: @afreak10 he was not staying after that pass on nunu in mid
[3:08:40] heckin_majestic: I got stuck on vlad in aram and my team did not enjoy it

[3:09:35] BlurredVision18: lol Aatrox pushed
[3:10:02] DrewGamer: yes that is his ult JP He also gets a LOT of lifesteal as well
[3:10:09] MasqureMan: Have they made any other Darkin champs?
[3:10:30] BlurredVision18: No, only cute waifus, no cool champs
[3:10:41] galdamesh: varus is half darkin
[3:10:42] Walshmobile: @MasqureMan kayn's weapon is a darkin, I forget  if varus's bow is still or not (it got retconned a couple years ago)
[3:10:45] BlurredVision18: gotta follow the money]
[3:10:46] Boonia: kayn is darkin I think

[3:11:49] Omakie: aatrox
[3:11:52] Omakie: i hate that mofo
[3:12:05] DyingEros: Jun would've been nice there
[3:12:11] DyingEros: Could've got a kill and push
[3:12:11] BlurredVision18: I want more Voli's Urgot, Aatrox, Kench, Aniva, Rek'sai, etc.
[3:12:55] Insigmada: a lot of these melee heroes have a pull in move
[3:13:12] Insigmada: seems bad design
[3:13:13] Walshmobile: wtf is bot doing
[3:13:29] afreak10: blind team
[3:13:40] wikes60: made him pay for it
[3:13:47] Darkaros: holy fuck this attack on titan x call of duty crossover looks cursed
[3:13:49] BlurredVision18: Vlad god
[3:13:50] MasqureMan: I remember when Ashe was so strong no melee could catch her, so they started giving everyone gap closers
[3:14:01] TETLegion: i mean nunu wasnt that bad. he got them to stand there for so long and miss lane. but bot lane took too long
[3:14:09] CastIronJake: does an execute give any gold?
[3:14:10] ZMightyCheeba: mad vlad man limmyParty
[3:14:20] freaker286: think he wins right now fi you fight straight up
[3:14:25] Walshmobile: @CastIronJake nah, it's the pro move to get executed so enemy team doesn't get gold out of it
[3:14:39] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: 100 percent skill based. can you dodge his abilities
[3:14:53] CastIronJake: @CastIronJake gotcha, i knew it didn't in aram wasn't sure on regular league
[3:15:07] Darkaros: PepoChamp rotated top for a flash
[3:15:28] BlurredVision18: FeelsBadMan
[3:15:40] DyingEros: Jun really is make or break.
[3:15:47] Athleon: I like how he burns the flash and then he doesn't followup for the kill
[3:15:51] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: You hard win the fights if you dodge his qs
[3:15:56] DyingEros: If you get support games roll but without a good jun its almost GGs
[3:15:59] FyLaw95: irelia is a hard champ in general, im plat and cant play her
[3:16:11] Sakkyoku: That's why I use my ahri challenger skin
[3:16:11] Athleon: like what's the point of burning th e flash in teh first place if you're not gonna exploit it
[3:16:12] Grimreap3r361: i think irlea is bad luck
[3:16:12] Hyluhnduh: sheriffWOT
[3:16:26] SlipCrit: i thought challenger crashed and burned tho?

[3:20:06] Convectt: your farm is decent tho
[3:20:11] Shipless: Does freezing the lane work, or is that possible with this champ?
[3:20:19] Loganok: anyone got the name of the lol info overlay jp used some time?

[3:21:56] Grimreap3r361: irelia
[3:22:04] jingosaurus: @Grimreap3r361 Irelia is very very strong 1v1. One of the strongest in the game tbh
[3:22:17] BlurredVision18: @Grimreap3r361 she absolutely is here dueling protentional is insane, and can easy 1 v 2 if you know what you're doing
[3:22:55] jingosaurus: Yes exactly
[3:22:58] jingosaurus: Like what trundle did
[3:23:00] Omakie: that is very true

[3:23:29] MKHEROX: i try to split push top  and always die and get roasted for feeding.
[3:23:35] Athleon: I mean that's the etnire purpose of Singed lol
[3:23:38] zymioi: i do that when my team mates do not want to push dragons
[3:23:38] PangurBanTheCat: Lots of ways and different scenarios to use that too
[3:23:39] Edot_KH: @Korkauflauf don't accidentally burn by focusing on stream too much lol
[3:23:40] jingosaurus: @mkultrati wards are your friend
[3:23:45] MasqureMan: That‚Äôs mainly what you abuse when you have teleport, because then you can just TP to a fight
[3:23:46] stringz: if u pressure ur lane, enemy will eventually focus on u yep

[3:24:10] SteelMansfield: shit hits
[3:24:10] Felgrun: Yes
[3:24:12] OuroborosChemist: that works better if you can duel against 3-4/5 of their team tho pushing top and keeling over any1 who comes by doesnt achieve much
[3:24:15] SteelMansfield: *she hits
[3:24:17] TETLegion: what I didnt see it
[3:24:21] BlurredVision18: It's called Split Pushing, one of the fundamental strats of the game.
[3:24:22] Felgrun: Normal, no, but she has it
[3:24:22] MistroPain: thats genius!
[3:24:39] ghostwind32: what a great assist
[3:24:41] Felgrun: And it works so uuuuuuh yes
[3:25:09] BlurredVision18: Entire character kits are focused on the split push playstyle, Irelia being one of them, and Trundle LUL
[3:25:09] cenwenki: Morgana playin good
[3:25:13] zymioi: is it going to me one of those games where u win lane but lose game

[3:25:44] BestGinger4: you took turret first, so you won lol
[3:25:47] jingosaurus: I personally think you can fight him
[3:25:50] ashla11: 2x kill before lane started though meant op support lol
[3:25:52] sunflower204: is that aatrox the good kind or the trash kind?
[3:25:54] Felgrun: Should probably focus on bot lane now

[3:26:43] Tylerjsmith97: @darkaros open up this door goofy!
[3:26:44] BlurredVision18: you only need to swap lanes, when one turret is still standing, since both are gone in doesn't really matter.
[3:26:47] WeeMr_Goodcat: 3 and 1, lets go

[4:51:39] SeanR3: Bronze is the land of anything can happen
[4:51:41] Invess: Jinx always comes through in the end

[4:51:44] DJunioD: OMEGALUL
[4:51:46] Veltanos: @Darkaros seriously...
[4:51:46] freka_man: well ff in low elo is a motivation not to lose
[4:51:48] titanodin: @Darkaros arcane power spike
[4:51:49] Proph89: Any MH fans recommend MH:Rise for a first MH game?
[4:51:53] freka_man: is weird but is how it works
[4:52:00] CamberCYM: @Proph89 Rise was my first, it's great
[4:52:01] captain_doggy: Jinx did little till late where she popped off
[4:52:03] DagooX: Jinx was Pepega at the start, but got lucky
[4:52:05] Darkaros: ijpNODDERS Yes I strongly recommend MH Rise as a first MH game
[4:52:06] Sheal88: @Darkaros ijpNODDERS
[4:52:08] BlurredVision18: @Proph89 No, but you'll probably like it, so yes
[4:52:10] Sylonn: jinx didnt really carry just got the reset with low Hp cleanup
[4:52:11] Veltanos: that was a hell of a come back, and quite unexpected
[4:52:18] Darkaros: It even has "omega-easy" mode in the singleplayer-only quests KEKW

[4:52:40] Moose2033: ijpOLLIE
[4:52:43] ReginaldXIV: Have they said if the patches launch with the PC version?
[4:52:45] DerfOnTurf: ijpOLLIE
[4:52:45] thekingofthewolf1: @Proph89 try the demo and see what wepon you want
[4:52:51] Invess: @Proph89 play the card game
[4:52:54] ReginaldXIV: I don't want 2/3rds of a game
[4:53:00] zymioi: ijpDOGSLIDE ijpBOOP
[4:53:09] BlurredVision18: Rise is gonna be the "full game"
[4:53:13] CamberCYM: @ReginaldXIV All the patches are available at launch yeah
[4:53:16] Darkaros: Oh ya. If you're new to MH you need to figure out a weapon to play. There's 14 you can swap at any time. They're playstyle-defining. Try as many as you have to to find your groove.
[4:53:17] zymioi: dog was trying to sneak a fire
[4:53:21] ritchie313: over world?
[4:53:22] ReginaldXIV: @CamberCYM good

[4:53:29] MCelven: @itmeJP How about Lost Ark? Any chance you playing it on launch?
[4:53:31] Cardsharp: Rise is So good! Love it!
[4:53:35] Jaq_CT: world was godlike
[4:53:39] Cardsharp: Can't wait for the release tomorrow
[4:53:44] Darkaros: It is easier, but it also has good QoL
[4:53:46] Invess: the singleplayer is easier I guess
[4:53:51] Karamor: a lot easier
[4:53:52] StarPogPlatinum: I don't think it's easier, the last even quests are kinda hard. Monsters can straight up one shot you
[4:54:00] Darkaros: World or Rise are good intros. The question was "is Rise good for new players" ijpSIP
[4:54:00] SoulCrusher842: lol
[4:54:01] ReginaldXIV: Monster Hunter World was easy too until Teostra and Behemoth
[4:54:03] amonwhite: is it a good port?
[4:54:03] Proph89: ijpPOGGERS
[4:54:03] DJunioD: D:
[4:54:11] Joebeezer: don't do it
[4:54:13] Joebeezer: LUL
[4:54:15] Invess: I wish we had cross save for rise
[4:54:15] CDubTheRIPper: ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE
[4:54:18] Kyriac: are you raiding savage in ff14?
[4:54:20] BlurredVision18: The whole game is easy, the Hunter got stronger than every but the monsters have stayed the same, not that it's bad, it's fun, just different.
[4:54:25] apb____: he says it's ruff
[4:54:25] ReginaldXIV: ijpSUFFER
[4:54:26] SoulCrusher842: lmfao
[4:54:31] zymioi: lol
[4:54:32] iilu: I would like daily Ollie Wisdom
[4:54:38] psychic_ward: y
[4:54:40] aChillyCube: Ollie likes sprinkle treats from the cat sandbox!
[4:54:44] Puretaz: Ive heard others say good things about the port too
[4:54:54] psychic_ward: ijpNOM ijpW1
[4:54:57] 14neo: i don't know whether i should try out MH Rise or not monkaHmm
[4:55:04] Insigmada: The wisdom of cat shit is good ijpHMM I think I'll pass
[4:55:13] ReginaldXIV: MH isn't a hard game til g-rank
[4:55:19] allscorpion: "I think the current state of the game means that whoever has the most skill will achieve victory" - Ollie
[4:55:19] TPLivewire: Would you say you enjoyed Rise or World better? I'm debating whether I want to play Rise.
[4:55:20] BlurredVision18: @14neo there's a free demo
[4:55:24] SchnellBier: the recommended specs for the port are pretty low so I guess the port is good
[4:55:24] WeeMr_Goodcat: sorry another random curious question, do you dye your hair? we are similar age and hair colour, but mines now peppered with grey....just wondered ijpOLD
[4:55:44] Ryhs1374: never saw a good anivia support
[4:55:48] StarPogPlatinum: A lot of people compare Rise with Iceborne but Rise G-rank isn't even out yet
[4:56:05] Darkaros: I liked Iceborne better because it has an actual endgame LUL but that's an unfair comparison. I'd say Rise is better than World, at least with its patches included
[4:56:13] Felgrun: Anivia Support is probably a One Trick
[4:56:19] Achubra: dat anivia support
[4:56:28] Joebeezer: anivia support
[4:56:30] StarPogPlatinum: I'm playing Generations Ultimate right now, it's so brutal compared to World or Rise
[4:56:32] CamberCYM: If they dont keep wirebugs in the future, they dumb
[4:56:34] i_revarm: dont  hate on anivia
[4:56:37] Joebeezer: it could be good
[4:56:39] harnessed: Anivia support is fine btw
[4:56:40] KinkDaddius: the wirebugs are so damn good, Monster Hunter 6 needs to have something like them or I might cry
[4:56:41] Grimreap3r361: and what about MH stories
[4:56:41] SoulCrusher842: Anivia support.. where they wall off the adc to save themselves Kappa
[4:56:41] aChillyCube: bird support isn't that bad
[4:56:41] WombatSN: anivia supp is fun. lane wide walls
[4:56:42] Felgrun: Noxus hunter, yeah definitely a one trick
[4:56:42] Gliverz: Anniva is helping
[4:56:42] Insigmada: Is that a bad supp?
[4:56:48] league_of_feels: We need MHW 2 id play the hell outta it.
[4:56:50] Muffnar: Anivia support is good but Yasuo mid is sus
[4:56:55] SoulCrusher842: Anivia support sucks
[4:56:55] Achubra: what the worst that can happen?
[4:56:55] BlurredVision18: and Rise has an emphasis on arena hunting compared to the immersion World has.
[4:56:56] Athleon: anivia support is fine
[4:57:01] i_revarm: anivia is amazing vs certain comps
[4:57:01] Darkaros: MH Stories I've heard really good things about. It's a Mon game tho :p different genre entirely
[4:57:08] Joebeezer: anivia support with vayne is hilarious
[4:57:09] Ryhs1374: @league_of_feels true
[4:57:11] titanodin: @TPLivewire both are great, but i would say world was made for new players
[4:57:12] SoulCrusher842: It's not fine.. you can bully anivia easily
[4:57:13] Athleon: in this rank anything goes really if you're comfortable with it
[4:57:15] aChillyCube: +1
[4:57:23] zymioi: @Darkaros i want to buy that game one day
[4:57:23] Trident901: rooPog
[4:57:24] 14neo: @14neo gotcha, it's just if i were to get it i'd intend to play co-op, don't know if my friendos are getting it on release or not yet monkaHmm
[4:57:25] uui23: bot is probably going to be clown show so ready your tp there LUL
[4:57:28] chowdubs: here comes the first lol jk
[4:57:29] StarPogPlatinum: The truth is... all Monster Hunter games are fun if you like MH
[4:57:34] gobbothegreen: time for him to lose
[4:57:35] Darkaros: ^ NODDERS
[4:57:38] jesterdetester85: @StarPogPlatinum very true

[4:57:40] MammothEU: bot is gonna be interesting
[4:57:40] BlurredVision18: @StarPogPlatinum tru
[4:57:48] Darkaros: what we need is a MH game where you only hunt Kirin variants
[4:57:50] HarleyB0t: Oof, I‚Äôm on a FF14 break right now after Endwalker MSQ. I am too depressed to continue. I think I need a therapy session. coxClown

[5:31:19] xDreadnord: random mid fight
[5:31:20] bansheehero: I wonder if there is a league level that you can start blaming it on others. Something like not enough good players on SC2 NA or something like that :)
[5:31:24] BlurredVision18: LUL
[5:31:32] i_revarm: sadly your team is apparently  crazy  allergic to winning

[5:33:34] i_revarm: I lost a  game  earlier  where i had 50k dmg, next  person in the game  had 24k
[5:33:36] 2x0k: hard to engage when the team is constantly putting themselves in danger
[5:33:38] Omakie: honestly irelia just requires alot of early risk that chogath doesnt really let you have

[5:43:24] Grimreap3r361: wait is it normal to take E first with MF

[5:48:35] i_revarm: small tip, if  you're just farming under  tower with no immidiatethreataround, standing close to the  minion you're about to hit makes it easier, less  travel time on the dmg

[6:07:16] Miracleshot: the vlad has been toxic tilted all game
[6:07:28] Keirby: must be rough being an adc 8/0 and having a team trying to ff
[6:07:42] Fearnim: vlad true to his char, he sucks
[6:07:45] BlurredVision18: careful Diana, Vlad might run it down if provoked
[6:07:54] mr_moustachi: If naut gets a good ult in its ez
[6:07:57] ninja2601: @itmeJP that guy usually is you
[6:07:59] afreak10: Vlad throwing
[6:08:02] BlurredVision18: that Garen tho, flash silence

[6:08:10] Joebeezer: yep that sucks
[6:08:20] jessyloxxx: its not garen, ur nautilus sucks
[6:08:23] arteri0n: shame
[6:08:31] CDubTheRIPper: Sadge
[6:08:38] freka_man: u need anti heal item
[6:08:42] Joebeezer: you need renekton to engange and naut to peal
[6:08:47] freka_man: for tanks like garen and mord
[6:08:49] Dbrn47: nautilus was actually getting JP kills though
[6:09:08] BlurredVision18: Naut was carrying early lane phase
[6:09:09] jessyloxxx: good nautilus wouldnt let garen even touch you
[6:09:20] mr_moustachi: @jessyloxxx Yep. 0 peel 0 engage
[6:09:31] Miracleshot: the naut cant peel all of them and engage
[6:09:42] Keirby: @jessyloxxx problem is naut is having to engage as well as peel because rene is too chicken to go in first
[6:09:43] NixonNarwhal: @jessyloxxx Garen has been waiting then engaging once cooldowns are present, renekton not engaging leaves only naut to do so
[6:09:44] zymioi: lol i love how the chatty ones are the ones loosing the game but think that they are pro lol
[6:09:44] Miracleshot: renek hasnt engaged once

[6:10:42] mr_moustachi: @Miracleshot His ult can inock up all for ult then basic ark for root should be plenty
[6:10:51] Keirby: this vlad too heavy
[6:10:56] i_revarm: you can  tell someone else to get the antiheal
[6:11:01] jessyloxxx: @NixonNarwhal talking about jp's team, nautilius doesnt have to engage, especial
[6:11:02] Natjen8: vlad needs to learn what overstaying is
[6:11:09] i_revarm: and get the armorpen item with a  spellshield
[6:11:10] jessyloxxx: @NixonNarwhal especially when mf is carrying
[6:11:24] NixonNarwhal: someone needs too, MF can't engage lul
[6:11:42] BlurredVision18: does Pen mf even need grievous wounds, she does enough burst
[6:11:50] mbryer07: vlad really built defense for only mord he's a moron

[6:15:48] i_revarm: honestly, getting more  sustain or even more dmg  should be  better  than that mortal reminder
[6:15:49] freka_man: get a GA instead of QSS
[6:15:49] Joebeezer: upgrade it
[6:15:55] i_revarm: upgrade qss to its full item
[6:16:05] BlurredVision18: you still haven't finished the item? LOL

[6:16:15] BlurredVision18: I didn't notice
[6:16:16] Sniper4life7: not that update

[6:16:23] WantedOne: Lol the vlad model
[6:16:26] Joebeezer: tbf back when jp played in the before times
[6:16:51] Hewch007: qss is one of the last upgrades you make since its not as gold efficiant as what jps built already
[6:16:58] freka_man: GA
[6:16:58] synreir: what, its almost always had mercurial scimitar?
[6:17:03] freka_man: Guardian Angel
[6:17:04] Miracleshot: 4 engage champs naut only one to engage fights
[6:17:18] afreak10: F
[6:17:23] Ryuenjin: nah, for a very long time it was just QSS @synreir
[6:17:24] StarPogPlatinum: Naut somehow managed to die lol
[6:17:35] i_revarm: get  scimitar qss upgrade, sell mortal reminder and get ga would be my advice
