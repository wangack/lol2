[0:17:05] Top_cheddar: My stupid cat bit my arm last night to wake me up so I could put the covers over him....
[0:17:05] noelsixty: probably antialiasing
[0:17:06] Darkaros: it's the complete package
[0:17:09] yrvengalied: Dockec mode switch is the best version
[0:17:09] Sir_Nerdly: If only they made a new version, maybe a pro version, with an OLED screen.
[0:17:10] Rustles2: Switch looks better yeah
[0:17:15] Goopymage01: switch looks better to me
[0:17:17] Dumt: I thought, and still think, Monster Hunter Rise are, and is, damn good for what it is. :(
[0:17:19] xarantur: it's so uh unfocused with switch wtf
[0:17:19] zymioi: i hate to say this but i do not see the difference NotLikeThis
[0:17:21] Sluggs_: @Darkaros is the expansion gonna release same time?
[0:17:23] Dbrn47: yeah I'm looking at comparisons, there's many scenes where it's hard to see a difference
[0:17:30] Cixah: the only difference i see if 60 vs 30
[0:17:31] Darkaros: Sluggs_ Ya they tweeted it would
[0:17:34] 0ldnslow: HDr is really good
[0:17:34] blissfuldan: Can you take the PC version to a rooftop party with friends tho? Checkmate atheists
[0:17:36] Dbrn47: but some scenes are pretty clear
[0:17:36] SZebra: Is the PC version using FXAA or something?
[0:17:37] Cixah: and its not really any different otherwise
[0:17:37] GrittzNGravy: lol i was think that too LUL
[0:17:38] Darkaros: I can dig up the tweet but I posted it on Sam's Discord ages ago
[0:17:38] afreak10: its just slower
[0:17:42] Sluggs_: guess i have to get pc version then
[0:17:44] Dakublaze: I think the PC version has depth of field on
[0:17:49] Arcmourn: pc 4k
[0:17:49] SirCris: I notice a difference in the cape physics, that's about it
[0:17:50] Xibate: world looks better on pc
[0:17:51] Cixah: 1080p vod :vomit:
[0:17:55] genericnumber: PC the blur looks annoying
[0:17:56] MagnaCarter_: the game has 4k textures
[0:17:58] SZebra: @Dakublaze Ah, that would make sense.
[0:17:59] deterdetz456: "but i can play portable though" -switch players
[0:18:00] Collected1: that looks incredible for a hand held device
[0:18:05] Omid18: there is a chance they did no upressing on the PC etxtures
[0:18:10] afreak10: yep
[0:18:11] Sluggs_: its a switch port of course world will look better
[0:18:11] Sir_Nerdly: Yeah I feel like the higher res for pc is the bigger selling point, less so the 1080 vs 1080 comparison
[0:18:12] afreak10: less blur
[0:18:14] yrvengalied: @itmeJP the score overlay is showing
[0:18:21] Rustles2: Lighting is way better on the PC
[0:18:23] NoorElBahrain: ijpHI

[1:36:10] Kurozakai: destiny is doing the same thing I think @itmejp
[1:36:14] loki15kun: Says it's for everyone eligible now
[1:36:15] AN71V1RU5: didn't FFXIV have gift 4 subs for fat chocobo?

[1:37:35] loki15kun: I rent mine with Prime ;)
[1:37:35] yrvengalied: Sadge
[1:37:39] zerohour_88: @Darkaros also canta, he/she's a god in MH at least

[1:37:58] Rockmetler: Is what it is homie, you do you
[1:38:11] WayneG947: I know he doesn't need it, but Max streamed a shit ton of the game too
[1:38:14] Rustles2: It'll be a marketing agency I would assume
[1:38:15] BarryCarlyon: Streamer selection for things barely does make sense half the time
[1:38:19] CorporalPibb: most definitely
[1:38:20] Dbrn47: Strippin just said Twitch submitted the list
[1:38:22] david_the_giant: @itmeJP strippin confirmed, twitch submitted a list
[1:38:23] Dbrn47: on stream
[1:38:27] DanXaliberc: @BarryCarlyon agreed
[1:38:28] aurice_heartly: yeah thats totally what happened
[1:38:31] Layercake: Ofc Shitty as always ...they really give 0 fucks about the people promoting the game. Big numbers...good.
[1:38:34] Scottyshome: he was just saying that in stream
[1:38:35] AKraftyBasterd: Presumably they decide that people who already play it will STILL play it, new streamers will do it now because paid
[1:38:40] DangerRangerRex: stripFaint stripFaint stripFaint stripFaint
[1:38:43] Mrshilka: jesus christ stalker 2 is now dec 22
[1:38:45] Mrshilka: 2022
[1:38:46] LegendsOfBobby: jp i love you
[1:38:50] freaker286: Ya, has to be twitch because if Strippen is sponsored, would think want to double dip and do a smart promotion, but hey, its twitch sometimes lol
[1:38:53] espi: Twitch NotLikeThis
[1:38:54] SgtStruthers: They probably use soulless analytics to figure out who to put on it
[1:38:56] woschdvendetta: capcom content creator/community interaction seems not the best tho, they had pretty stupid requirements in the past to restream stuff etc.
[1:39:02] TH3HAMM3RGUY: can we see your rig?
[1:39:03] BarryCarlyon: Twitch is _really_ bad at making lists. They never check them twice.
[1:39:04] Buttzyy: thought it was Dec 8th @Mrshilka
[1:39:08] GrievAY: @itmejp was that a large drink from McDonalds? Looked a lot bigger than what we got in Sweden
[1:39:10] Mrshilka: well 8th maybe
[1:39:14] espi: @SgtStruthers no no the algorithm has claimed MANY souls
[1:39:15] Mrshilka: that still fucking forever
[1:39:17] aurice_heartly: max is playing and he isnt sponsored but the issue is that the sponsored streamers are duing the day when he isnt live
[1:39:18] DangerRangerRex: TO THE TWITTER MACHINE
[1:39:21] aznhai: ijpMAD
[1:39:22] VoltecZero: All of Vshojo streamers in the list guess I'll be a coomer
[1:39:23] aurice_heartly: thats why it doesnt affect him
[1:39:25] Cygnatus: there are some offlinetv people who play a bunch of monhun, weird missed opportunity
[1:39:33] KatjeMauw: GrievAY your large is a med in usa
[1:39:33] Buttzyy: truuee after it having a original release of April
[1:39:35] david_the_giant: @BarryCarlyon its almost like the important people don't have time to actually get to know the different streaming communities. LUL
[1:39:39] NinjaXI: theres ppl on that list that dont even play those types of games xD
[1:39:41] SgtStruthers: @SgtStruthers ijpSUFFER
