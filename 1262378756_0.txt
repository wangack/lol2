[0:17:24] Gat0rCh0mp: Hey chat ijpHI
[0:17:29] i_revarm: what triggers me more is that league  has  a  loading  screen
[0:17:38] The_Faceless_Void: @zymioi well you also cant block ppl from queing up with you in matches but dota does
[0:17:39] i_revarm: it should be able  to load  while in the lobby
[0:17:45] The_Faceless_Void: also LOLs client
[0:17:58] Ravenwings4: yeah not having a client update in 7 seasons is rough
[0:18:04] Ravenwings4: probably the worst part of the experience tbh
[0:18:05] i_revarm: did anyone play dawngate when it  was a thing?
[0:18:20] ShrowdArrow: if we lose this game chat, it's because we're not master chef

[0:18:40] Gat0rCh0mp: Hey they moved the position in the client that you pick your role before queuing, thats an update lol
[0:18:41] Miros__: @i_revarm only issue then is if people dodge... game would need to unload, potentially

[0:18:51] IToldYouItsTaken: try negotiating with him
[0:19:24] i_revarm: @Miros__ i think it could load assets used in every game and just have it sit loaded on the gpu/ram if you have the capacity
[0:20:05] Miros__: @i_revarm based on how long some of the loading times are in my matches, some people are playing this on potatoes. They def don't have the capacity..
[0:20:12] i_revarm: btw, tahm  is  gonna get changed again, think he  will end  up as support again
[0:20:22] epicshoo: monkaS

[0:21:06] Jukettaja: Doesn't mean Twitch won't gank
[0:21:09] 2x0k: his hero has no mana bar? just endlessly reuses abilities
[0:21:10] EightBitDelight: @AinzN ijpCHEER ijpHI

[0:35:37] DannoTanno: I like the move speed on FoN over the healing bonus on Spirit.
[0:35:59] eviltox: JP no longer using blitz? what he replaced it with?
[0:36:00] i_revarm: tahm has healing and shielding in his kit, the passive  is  really strong on him
[0:36:14] LegendsOfBobby: ^
[0:36:24] AinzN: eviltox u.gg I think

[0:37:45] i_revarm: well played
[0:37:51] DannoTanno: Ugg is good for build paths and tier lists of champs. Blitz is good for checking out enemy team players stats and weaknesses.
[0:38:06] i_revarm: porofessor  does it  all Kappa

[0:39:23] i_revarm: @DannoTanno hence the kappa, though  i prefer mysoftware to not  mine bitcoin on my pc, thats why i got  rid of blitz way back when that was  a thing
[0:40:02] DannoTanno: Yea, no need to DL any app if Poro offers it for free.
[0:40:11] IAmBarboodith: lol, jhin just hiden in a bush

[1:24:43] Darkaros: Uhh. You'll be good at lane mechanics w/ Smite experience for sure
[1:24:43] HursheyCrisp: you didn't buy a trinket
[1:25:00] HursheyCrisp: Oh that's a neat mechanic
[1:25:04] cin_paii: heya chat and jp!
[1:25:12] Ardranas: it AUTOBUYS? so much handhowlding ijpEZ
[1:25:17] camerongio1: yeah trinkets auto buy its very handy
[1:25:21] Darkaros: Just gotta relearn champs and items. I think real Smite has a jungler so you'll be used to that? I only play Arena LUL
[1:25:27] bigno985: ok thanks, between you and my friends playing League I've been thinking about getting into it.
[1:25:32] MasqureMan: My original problem with Dota 2 is how all the environment blends together
[1:25:48] MasqureMan: Especially coming from Warcraft 3
[1:25:48] Miri_TX: Trundle is OP IMO. Not flashy but solid and gets work done.
[1:25:52] Sogybritches: man i havent played smite in awhile, arena was always a blast
[1:25:56] freaker286: ya, around 3 min is a good one
[1:25:58] lormike: @Darkaros LUL Same Arena players ftw!
[1:26:00] freaker286: for first gank
[1:26:01] Weeniz: Enemy jungler paths up around 3 minutes, so 2:30 is a good time
[1:26:02] Darkaros: Dota is wack.The more you think about it the more it stands out from other Mobas these days since they follow LoL's jungler formula while Dota has rotations everywhere
[1:26:12] keogg: around 3:30 is good when junglers finish their first clear
[1:26:13] vTwin_IndianScout: I ward at about 3min since that's when the jungle would be rotating up if they start blue
[1:26:16] everkn0wn: kinda depends as well
[1:26:21] DejaDrew: @Darkaros Yeah I can't stand DOTA
[1:26:22] ChowYun: Depends on the enemy jungler champ i would say
[1:26:28] k0jak: also dark if u wanna gamba go for it
[1:26:28] camerongio1: Its good to word before 2:50 as junglers usually finish red around 3-3:10 at least in higher elo, might be around 3:30 here
[1:26:33] Miri_TX: @itmejp As you get familiar with the junglers, you'll learn their start and pathing so you know best ward time.
[1:26:33] Tronmakers: is smite still popular at all. i remember playing that a while back
[1:26:39] GameOnlyNoTalk: ward around 2:30 or as soon as you push past river
[1:26:39] TDotTerror: More like 'Yawn-eh', right?
[1:26:42] NyxaNight: well yone came from river so their jungler must have gone red to blue, so late ward
[1:26:50] IAmBarboodith: Crab spawns at 3:15. so you can expect a gank a little before or after (depending on the side the jg started)
[1:26:55] zymioi: does dota2 still get support or did steam for get about that game??
[1:27:08] DejaDrew: nice one

[2:04:46] TDotTerror: Widdle Wuu.
[2:04:47] psychic_ward: understandable and why not go with what works for you for a while.
[2:04:54] ZeroDjinn: Garen, Darius are both easy to learn strong champs in lane honestly

[2:05:53] Archangel3003: I think my problem with why I'm so bad at the game is I can't stick playing the same champ too long. I get days where I randomly want to play some one else.

[2:07:00] Duncain: garens ult is ap
[2:07:11] GrievAY: Think that is why some never climb you play to hard champs, Annie is a perfect example of a good mid to climb with. Point and click stun.
[2:07:13] ZeroDjinn: @GraveSalad better imo
[2:07:19] IToldYouItsTaken: @Duncain it's true damage

[2:12:32] k0jak: iamjustacow i disagree
[2:12:47] hitbox_royal_rabbit: But I'm Wood 4 and haven't played since s9
[2:12:48] hitbox_royal_rabbit: so
[2:13:06] OuroborosChemist: unless its super auto attacker like Trynd
[2:13:17] AutumnReds: 7 cs on you is crushing it?
[2:13:27] FloridaMan82: in top lane yes
[2:13:31] Catzumo: one kill is about 15 cs, if that hasnt change
[2:13:44] k0jak: anneS doubters might win one
[2:13:52] Darkaros: 7 cs is basically a minion wave lol

[2:27:04] konvay: I'm sure HoN was fine, but it's the hardest for me to understand what's going on as a viewer. The colors blended far too much. Dota2 was better, but League the characters pop from the landscape, much easier to be a viewer
[2:27:11] Convectt: @uui23 Yeah I played that last time like 9-10 years ago
[2:27:33] k0jak: homie lost 250k loot in 30 seconds
