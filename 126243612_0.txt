[3:37:50] innu2919: MARIN LPL 4Head
[3:37:59] tsm_s7_world_champs: TFW you realize Hauntzer is a top 3 top laner in worlds PogChamp
[3:38:01] goblinguy01: TSM can even 3-0 Ecko Fox
[3:38:01] cavalRy7: Kt will win worlds this year. They're like the EDG which beat SKT in MSI but better. Incredible early game
[3:38:02] onRmatheus: Marin can't carry his *** bot lane 4Head
[3:38:05] Aline_Kawaii: Kappa

[3:40:43] Karuaan: @eden_fesi always thought he was better than smeb
[3:40:43] tsm_s7_world_champs: Watching LPL when TSM wins S7 worlds easily LUL
[3:40:53] fakerofbronze13: LPL is basically high elo solo queue FailFish
[3:40:57] goblinguy01: TSM wont make it to MSI
[3:41:01] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Eden_Fesi, you're such a retard I can't tell if you're trolling or serious
[3:41:03] Gunerdrag: TSM could easily take a game or two from KT / SKT if you say otherwise ur just blinded by hate lol
[3:41:11] Sov25: remember when tsm thought they were top 4 LUL
[3:41:12] goblinguy01: They will lose to Africa
[3:41:12] Ralleezy: @eden_fesi easy to teamfight well when you have the best midlaner and 2nd best teamfight adc in korea
[3:41:26] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Gunerdrag, yeah most people in LCK/LPL chats are retards they wont admit that.. TSM only team to destroy SSG in groups
[3:41:28] trisde24: dat clear wave is so stupid
[3:41:29] im_moyo: @Ralleezy, yeah that's a reasonable argument

[3:41:47] im_moyo: @Karuaan, yeah, but im giving my opinion, not hunis
[3:41:48] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Karuaan, he's trolling, Huni is garbage
[3:42:01] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Karuaan, everyone knows Huni sucks
[3:42:02] goblinguy01: Wait you mean Memeos C9, FreeSm, FreeLG
[3:42:03] Rain_cub: Trackers knife graves is so DansGame
[3:42:14] Sov25: I think Huni will get better with time. after playing with the trash in na lcs he's only going to improve
[3:42:15] Ralleezy: @eden_fesi the main reason SKT lost 2-0 to Afreeca was beacause Marin was 2v1ing Blank/Peanut and Huni while everyone else was on map
[3:42:23] onRmatheus: NA will suck again like every year ResidentSleeper shut up pls
[3:42:25] fakerofbronze13: C9 is total garbage, NA is screwed if they go to MSI
[3:42:26] Gunerdrag: TSM is easily top 3 at the moment
[3:42:28] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Terrorsq, I already know you're a troll
[3:42:31] trisde24: huni suck? u see dat ults on rumble in 2 game vs kt?

[3:44:29] Karuaan: @eden_fesi but imo marin and summday > huni and smeb
[3:44:31] im_moyo: @Karuaan, I think Smeb is a bit better than Huni just cuz Smeb has some insane tps

[3:46:57] everyoneelseistrash0: Western teams only just farm and wait to be destroyed , don't want to seek chance and fight. and their fans even laugh at LPL fighting style. Why don't they think about why they even can't take single one game from KR team, but LPL team can? NotATK
[3:47:20] iseeyopantiess: Arrow losing to CLG LUL
[3:47:24] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Karuaan, no he isnt, he might look that way because of tank meta and being on SKT but he doesnt even compare to SKT Duke or Marin
[3:47:31] im_moyo: Stixxay is an animal tbh
[3:47:51] huntressofartemis23: i should try playing this game
[3:47:51] im_moyo: I think he's the best Western player

[3:48:23] cavalRy7: @sov25 Hauntzer rekt the *** out of Huni when he was on IMT
[3:48:23] tsm_s7_world_champs: Stixxay best western player? What in the fk is going on in this chat?
[3:48:29] Karuaan: @tsm_s7_world_champs duke is only good in lane he wasnt a good tf on skt last season but they basically won all the lanes every game
[3:48:37] tsm_s7_world_champs: Jesus fn christ I'm being trolled to hell and back right now

[3:49:12] get_updownleftright: haHAA
[3:49:13] im_moyo: yeah 100% better than Zven
[3:49:15] Sov25: @cavalry7 I don't blame him when playing with na domestic talent. Remember hauntzer at worlds? boosted kennen and 0 impact jayce
[3:49:18] huntressofartemis23: i know who the best western player is
[3:49:20] im_moyo: its a tossup between Jensen and Stixxay imo
[3:49:25] Lifemekhanism: Zven is trash
[3:49:27] tsm_s7_world_champs: Bjerg HAS been playing like garbage this season, Hauntzer is NA MVP so far
[3:49:31] im_moyo: I think both could do well in KR
[3:49:32] Dunlosi: LUL

[3:51:11] cavalRy7: @sov25 Also IMT had most expensive toster last year in NA probably. Domestic talent? Lul
[3:51:12] Karuaan: @lifemekhanism faker is the greatest player to have ever play lol

[3:54:22] im_moyo: Pobelter is far below average
[3:54:29] trisde24: just ignore that troll
[3:54:35] fakerofbronze13: Whenever Dardoch and Flame are doing poorly, IMT is losing
[3:54:35] get_updownleftright: IG botlane
[3:54:35] tsm_s7_world_champs: Pobelter is the best mid NA
[3:54:46] fakerofbronze13: the rest of IMT just can't step up
[3:54:48] im_moyo: is Olleh a flamer?
[3:54:51] tsm_s7_world_champs: Piglet destroying the best mid NA is pretty amazing PogChamp

[3:57:39] fakerofbronze13: Akaadian could be the best western jungler if he wasn't ridiculously inconsistent
[3:57:45] Karuaan: ya ssumday is my fav top all time
[3:57:56] im_moyo: 1 bad week = ridiculously inconsistent?
[3:57:58] tsm_s7_world_champs: ssumday looper flame all retired
[3:58:18] mrxdaddychill: dardouch and darshan is darshitt
[3:58:21] tsm_s7_world_champs: Hauntzer has destroyed them all in lane
[3:58:25] burrito_brian1: these are the WORST casters

[3:58:39] cavalRy7: Flame really sucks. Worst toplaner in NA lol

[3:58:51] Karuaan: top 3 NA jg: 1. Akaadian 2. Contractz 3. Sven
[3:58:52] cavalRy7: Ssumday 1v9 every game
[3:59:03] NardFtw: Casters are resident sleeper
[3:59:03] ashdobz: did i may win?
[3:59:09] mrxdaddychill: aphroomoo sucks
[3:59:12] tsm_s7_world_champs: @cavalRy7, its funny when people say NA sucks but anytime koreans import to NA they look like *** LUL
[3:59:15] im_moyo: top 3 NA jg: 1. Moon 2. Akaadian 3. Dardoch
[3:59:25] ashdobz: who won first game
[3:59:27] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Eden_Fesi, moon #1 LUL *** retard
[3:59:30] huntressofartemis23: you all seem to be nice. the last league chat i was on, i ran into an cranky man that insulted my ancestors
[3:59:33] Karuaan: @cavalry7 pissed we never got to see ssumday + kakao + rook1e on KT
[3:59:35] fakerofbronze13: Hai Moon Kreygasm
[3:59:37] mrxdaddychill: draftkings all day

[4:00:44] mrxdaddychill: skt
[4:00:46] fakerofbronze13: such a clown fiesta
[4:00:53] Karuaan: @eden_fesi as much as i like dardoch sven and contractz are playing better i kinda agree with moon and forgot to add him to my top 3 he will take svens spot
[4:00:57] Gunerdrag: @ash_dobz 2-0 imay\
[4:01:02] ashdobz: idk who to belive
[4:01:06] RustyTheCaster: Taco is correct, IMay won 2-0 easily
[4:01:07] ashdobz: thx
[4:01:11] im_moyo: Its hard to compare pawn to rookie when pawn is playing with 4 of the best players in the world and rookie only has Duke
[4:01:14] ashdobz: $_$
[4:01:17] Karuaan: reason why moon is so low is cause he has hai
[4:01:23] ashdobz: $$$$$ for me
[4:01:40] NardFtw: Get ***
[4:01:53] im_moyo: @Karuaan, Moon has been far and away the best jungler in NA, Contractz has been super average
[4:01:56] fakerofbronze13: Saying that Akaadian is ridiculously inconsistent wasn't quite accurate, Echo Fox as a whole is ridiculously inconsistent
[4:02:00] Karuaan: @eden_fesi Rook1e has been the best mid in china for 3 seasons now
[4:02:01] cavalRy7: Kata against Naut, Malz, Syndra
[4:02:03] tsm_s7_world_champs: Moon isn't even a good JG holy ***
[4:02:17] RustyTheCaster: P1 Meteos best jungler NA
[4:02:20] im_moyo: @Karuaan, thats fine, as of this season you cant really compare him and pawn
[4:02:31] tsm_s7_world_champs: @RUSTYTheCASTER, AGREED - Meteos AMAZING
[4:02:41] im_moyo: too much of a difference in the caliber of their supporting casts
[4:02:46] fakerofbronze13: Echo Fox could be a fantastic team if it wasn't for their odd week curse
[4:02:47] Karuaan: @eden_fesi moon also has the best shot caller of all time in lol history
[4:02:53] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Terrorsq, stfu
[4:02:56] im_moyo: uhh i dunno about that
[4:03:00] im_moyo: the best NA shotcaller
[4:03:05] TacosWillPronUs: rip
[4:03:06] cavalRy7: Pawn can go on 1v1 against Faker. Rook1e can't. End of discussion
[4:03:08] AI_Logic: LUL
[4:03:11] gogogocc: GG
[4:03:12] Karuaan: Hai is the best shot caller

[4:03:41] tsm_s7_world_champs: @Terrorsq, good, at least one of the 2 statements is true
[4:03:43] Karuaan: only other person i say is comparable to hai is mata in his prime

[4:05:04] cavalRy7: Inting
[4:05:54] Karuaan: @eden_fesi Dade wasnt the shot caller mata was. Marin is a choice but i think Hai is better and yellowstar was awesome i saw hai is above him and mata

[4:10:08] cavalRy7: Eden_fesi Sion and Poppy getting rework again? I don't think so
[4:10:16] kuroyukihime__: hasn't paid much attention to IG lately but I thought they had a new adc called Jackylove? What happened?
[4:10:17] Sublike: normal work day for them
[4:10:30] im_moyo: @cavalRy7, Riot said all the tanks were getting changed, it's like what happened to assassins
[4:10:44] everyoneelseistrash0: Scion most funny champion
[4:10:54] Rain_cub: Except all the assassins didn't get reworked
[4:11:01] im_moyo: who didnt?
[4:11:13] Rain_cub: Kassadin
[4:11:14] 靈魂棋手: tanker being more op midseason
[4:11:31] im_moyo: i think Kassasin is classified Diver
[4:11:34] chhopsky: you wish your air mattress was as tight as WE....?
[4:11:37] im_moyo: like Diana
[4:11:47] cavalRy7: Maokai needs literally 0 skill to play. Same with Naut
[4:11:57] cavalRy7: Point click stun
[4:12:01] rednecktie: GO HARD ON THAT CAT
[4:12:06] cavalRy7: And extreme tank
[4:12:21] chhopsky: cat
[4:12:39] im_moyo: is this prenerf or post nerf malzahar?
[4:12:44] AI_Logic: you mean snare Kappa
[4:12:44] Karuaan: @eden_fesi alright fine we can say dade but his shot callimg was average they won cause they basically won lane vs everyone
[4:12:45] chhopsky: 7.3
[4:12:49] cavalRy7: Post nerf
[4:12:54] im_moyo: ah kk
[4:13:00] Karuaan: except SSW
[4:13:01] huntressofartemis23: cool hairstyle
[4:13:04] cavalRy7: Fizz is coming back in 7.5 PogChamp
[4:13:14] Rain_cub: Diana is classified as a mage in her primary but kass is classified as an assassin
[4:13:22] 靈魂棋手: from s3 to s6 tanker op at the midseason,and final verson will be nerf
[4:13:30] chhopsky: kassassin
[4:14:12] Karuaan: @cavalry7 how?
[4:14:12] Neogeno: MVP = 2?
[4:14:16] im_moyo: @Rain_cub, oh yeah, youre right, riot just decided to leave him out for some reason lol
[4:14:41] 靈魂棋手: MVP TIMES 2
[4:14:46] cavalRy7: Karuaan they buffed his w extremely
[4:15:01] AI_Logic: level 1 firstblood
[4:15:06] Rain_cub: There's also a bunch of champions like yi and nocturn that are kinda assassins and fighters but got ignored also
[4:15:11] gl1mma: TriHard
[4:15:18] Karuaan: @cavalry7 he isnt even bad atm well new broken champ lol!!
[4:16:05] 靈魂棋手: who wanna see flash wolf?game start yet
[4:16:10] cavalRy7: He is bad lol. No kill pressure early anymore too low dmg in w and q
[4:16:28] im_moyo: he isnt bad at all, just not top tier
[4:16:32] Karuaan: ehh
[4:16:35] im_moyo: you can pick him and do fine
[4:16:45] Karuaan: he does a lot of damage
[4:16:54] cavalRy7: You need to snowball like Talon
[4:17:04] Karuaan: and early isnt supposed to be his good part
[4:17:14] Karuaan: @cavalry7 no he doesnt lol
[4:17:26] Karuaan: i was 3-0 on lb
[4:17:34] Karuaan: vs a fizz
[4:17:41] cavalRy7: Ye he was doing it and he cant anymore thats why he's bad
[4:17:43] 靈魂棋手: cc is most important thing in proplay
[4:17:55] im_moyo: that expectant look LMAO
[4:17:55] Rain_cub: I just feel like even with reworked assassins the mages match damage output have potential for the burst and provide utility so there's no incentive to play assassins
[4:17:56] 靈魂棋手: no cc =tier 2
[4:17:59] Karuaan: once he got his ult he one shot me at 6
[4:18:32] Karuaan: thats in diamond not bronze or silver
[4:18:43] Karuaan: so something there
[4:18:52] RustyTheCaster: You're also Leblanc, a fragile champion
[4:19:05] RustyTheCaster: Fizz hits 6 he has always been able to 1 hit some carries
[4:19:16] Karuaan: so i play cho mid against him?
[4:19:26] im_moyo: buffed cho PogChamp
[4:19:31] RustyTheCaster: Not quite what I'm implying no
[4:19:37] cavalRy7: 3-0 against fizz you proved my point. Shitty early laning
[4:19:41] 靈魂棋手: cho ap nerf
[4:20:01] 櫻ゆき: anyone here?
[4:20:02] ChatterBoxInc: oh wow a mod that talks in chat
[4:20:06] cavalRy7: He cant lane clear without sacrificing his only damage and escape
[4:20:06] Karuaan: @cavalry7 but he can still one shot
[4:20:18] 櫻ゆき: 4396 up up
[4:20:31] cavalRy7: W and q useless
[4:20:33] Karuaan: @cavalry7 a good fizz is scary tho
[4:20:40] huntressofartemis23: cant wait
[4:20:51] cavalRy7: Even a good termo is scary lol
[4:20:57] cavalRy7: Teemo*
[4:21:05] NardFtw: Amazing how tsm boy left when mod showed himself
[4:21:37] rednecktie: tsm girl has larger sex organs
[4:21:45] Rain_cub: Teemo actually has decent scaling potential but if people buy sweeper he basically only has three skills and one is a move speed buff
[4:21:54] huntressofartemis23: too much info
[4:21:56] cavalRy7: Fizz needs his e and w buffed to survive early game
[4:22:01] Karuaan: @cavalry7 and trust me fizz isnt bad hes overlooked cause of tge lethality changes and the way made his ult not autolock now cause it had a stupid hitbox
[4:22:04] cavalRy7: So he can have kill pressure
[4:22:36] Karuaan: @rain_cub ever played against tank teemo
[4:23:10] Rain_cub: Full damage teemo is suicide and basically only works vs bronze players
[4:23:29] Karuaan: @rain_cub liandrys into frozen mallet is so annoying to play against
[4:23:42] cavalRy7: I made a bronze to plat with full dmg jung teemo lol
[4:23:49] cavalRy7: It was fun
[4:24:09] Rain_cub: iPav smite teemo too PogChamp
[4:24:14] Rain_cub: Top
[4:24:15] Karuaan: @rain_cub i hate it cause i play champs that always get countered by teemo so i just hate teemo
[4:24:27] AI_Logic: The Jebaited teams into first picking rengar strat
[4:24:44] Rain_cub: Teemo is just kinda reliant on dominating lane and if he doesn't win he just feels bad
[4:25:16] cavalRy7: Tissues WutFace
[4:25:17] Karuaan: @rain_cub i play riven and yas top i love teemo a lot lol
[4:25:52] Rain_cub: Jungles are teemos worst enemy
[4:25:53] cavalRy7: You can destroy teemo with riven when you go all in
[4:26:00] FruitYogurt: issues Kappa
[4:26:07] Karuaan: @rain_cub especially onhit tank teemo
[4:26:17] Rain_cub: Teemo just gets snowballed all over

[4:27:12] huntressofartemis23: nice hair
[4:27:18] cavalRy7: I didnt see him winning 1 time
