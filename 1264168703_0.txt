[0:20:00] LmaoLp: @Lubufg or you could say that unlike other teams that might be up there with them, they have a proven track record of consistency last year and unlikely to have ego issues like other S/A tier teams
[0:20:58] LmaoLp: @uhisdnb theshy had a botlane for the first time since jackeylove left, he no longer had to giga burger flip things
[0:21:10] Whatssupman: What is "S/A" sir?
[0:21:12] ToTFlame: SeriousSloth Silverhand

[0:22:04] captainkrajick: Nah S/A is South America
[0:22:18] ToTFlame: South Africa SeriousSloth
[0:22:21] LmaoLp: @Whatssupman basically, the top tier teams of the league. or potential top tier. depends if you're approaching from potential vs expectations
[0:22:46] uhisdnb: @uhisdnb lets be real tho he wasn't a great burger flipper last few split haha. good to see him on better form again. always exciting to watch good Theshy
[0:23:04] Whatssupman: Then we could say WBG is S/A tier teams?
[0:24:12] LmaoLp: @uhisdnb kinda hard when enemy jg and supp visit your lane regularly while yours are putting out bot lane fires. plus, you gotta flip hard enough to carry games 3v5 :D
[0:25:08] LmaoLp: @Whatssupman potentially yeah. theshy and huanfeng are two great mechanical players, angel's pretty damn good himself. sofm and off though monkaS
[0:25:40] captainkrajick: ON stepped up hard since NEST last year wdym

[5:05:17] bengalistreams: @l3vi1 the only reason ur are saying LCK vs LPL, is because you know if you argued Korea vs China you would lose every time, so you change the goalposts. This is not even mentioning the fact that the best coachs are all Korean too.

[5:53:34] zzhibuz: how do Drops work? i got a message last game, like 5.4k viewers got a chest, when does it appear on my account?
[5:53:35] 03c63ef3: @bluesclues96 so you're saying, most of the LCK viewers on twitch are from KR? I woulda thought there would be some sort of KR streaming site instead
[5:53:47] l3vi1: @The_Edelen yeah this split music is not as good
[5:53:48] fazed343: @Munchables lebronJAM only
[5:54:06] rngbfs: @bluesclues96 so much, bozo
[5:54:22] bluesclues96: @03c63ef3 there's an LCK_Korea channel, and most westerners prefer LCK over LPL
[5:54:25] dragonslyer70: don't feed the kid
[5:54:27] nothingx55: @zero0ca not always sometimes theres some kid searching of attention writing something like "LCK>LPL"  and this trigger some hardcore fanboy. just ignore it
[5:54:34] rngbfs: all LPL fans are shambolic bozos, 0 macro region
[5:54:35] l3vi1: @03c63ef3 Koreans watch LCK on twitch unlike Chinese fans
[5:54:41] SirPodrickPayne: Vibe
[5:54:51] 03c63ef3: @bluesclues96 yeah, that's what i'm asking about. why do they prefer lck when it's so boring

[5:59:03] sickarrius: DIONB And Tarzan

[5:59:08] bluesclues96: @BlueNux because koreans always undermine the chinese players. look at worlds 2018 chat, most of them were spamming that TheShy and Rookie are korean for NO REASON

[5:59:53] tkirk1993: who won?
[6:00:03] bluesclues96: TES won 2-1
[6:00:08] rngbfs: @tkirk1993 TES - the fraud team
[6:00:12] BlueNux: @bluesclues96 To be fair, out of all the years, that year truly was carried by Koreans and showed the glaring effect of early importing. But nowadays, it's not as bad. Gimgoon is no Shy or Rookie. EDG this year Scout isn't crazy, though losing Viper hurts LCK a lot

[6:02:12] ramirez_arf: PowerUpR PowerUpR
[6:02:18] dragonslyer70: TheShy and Rookie are juat that good they wish they were koreans
[6:02:24] BlueNux: @bluesclues96 No one is discounting Chinese players. But the key carries were in fact theShy and Rookie that year. I think point is those and other Koreans never leaving Korea would have kept Korea at a much much higher level than LPL today. That's undeniable no?

[6:03:21] ysg60: bruh
[6:03:36] bluesclues96: @CognusNA huh
[6:03:38] BlueNux: @bluesclues96 Yeah, they can be pity. Why be triggered by them? Can't fight pity with pity. LPL is best because it combines amazing prospects from both countries. Part of that means weakening the competition (Korea/LCK). It's pretty obvious to me, but this chat argues nonstop.
[6:03:39] 你什麼咖阿: @bluenux So? FPX won the time of the Korean aid are very early to LPL, right?
[6:03:41] rngbfs: @bolyvfr DoinbV is a fraud, worse than xiye all-time

[6:04:43] l3vi1: @rngbfs TheShy never played in LCK so you shouldn't even include him cuz it actually works against you
[6:04:59] BlueNux: @dancing_with_death I prefer LPL much much over LCK. Surprise! Not everyone who favors LPL has the same opinion. Diversity of opinion. Get used to it.
[6:05:02] SwissCake: @blablaxx2 just waiting on teams to take the stage
[6:05:19] dekkerhun: hi
[6:05:24] rngbfs: @l3vi1 he was too awful to secure a spot, understandable.
[6:05:24] mercurialxc: actually the truth is that Korean they build up the whole esport system early than China, their have more proplayer by mature career system. These all ture. We just hate their arrogant attitude when they talk about their own player.
[6:05:25] l3vi1: Junjia is so good in soloQ but i'm not sure if he'd do well in pro
[6:05:32] Papaxa6655: Tarzan best jg lessss go
[6:05:39] JGabel: im very confused is chat arguing if LPL is better than LCK, or are you fighting if Chinese peopla are better at league thank koreans. those are two different things

[6:06:20] 你什麼咖阿: The most funny thing is not that LPL won the championship by Korean, but that 90% of the Korean players in the LPL team came to LPL very early, rather than those LCK players who came to LPL because LPL won the championship
[6:06:21] lckislck: kr player is center of lpl
[6:06:23] banduria13: yikes

[6:06:46] aceitacrl: Can we get drops just by having the live stream open or do i need to click in something after the drop appears?
[6:06:46] FWivan_uwu: The most funny thing is not that LPL won the championship by Korean, but that 90% of the Korean players in the LPL team came to LPL very early, rather than those LCK players who came to LPL because LPL won the championship
