[0:45:00] Stretchy302: Tidal waves? It was a tsunami
[0:45:07] Mick_: not tidal waves. Sunamis

[0:47:11] OuroborosChemist: you could build protective wall of 5m thick concerete that 15-20m tall
[0:47:13] ZcottD: only the sharknado could fend off a tsunami

[0:47:33] AinzN: You can have wave breakers but they aren't really built for tsunamis

[0:51:48] Sir_RobsterRoll: Remember the Thailand tsunami in Phuket? Wasn't too long ago...
[0:51:49] noelsixty: the warning i'm current having in my phone is 0.2m waves.
[0:51:50] Daruvik: what I read was 1-3ft waves on West Coast US, so nothing too severe
[0:51:59] Madinero: i hope we dutch dont get a big wave. we are mostly under sea level, so we would be fucked
[0:51:59] bansheehero: 1 foot wave is still better content than some youtubers :)
[0:52:15] Sir_RobsterRoll: omg that was 18 years ago D:
[0:52:36] BobbiTheDragon: how long ago was it in thailand?
[0:52:42] aki_mattis: @bobbithedragon 2004
[0:52:44] Kingeraser: its crazy all the people diving didnt rly notice it and when they came out of the water everything was gone
[0:52:46] HooverFan: indeed morbid as fuck
[0:52:57] RlDennis: @Madinero we're about as far away as possible from this, so it shouldn't really hit us
[0:52:57] OuroborosChemist: phuket tsunami was much lower than japans but much more deaths due lower infra tho
[0:52:57] SweCap: Phuket tsunami was awful. So many lost their lifes
[0:53:10] KlosterKatten: oof
[0:53:16] JeXus1985: jfc

[0:53:32] Reijm11: We were watching live at work when the Japan tsunami hit, it was surreal how big and fast it was
[0:53:39] KlosterKatten: @Stretchy302 .. no WTFF
[0:53:40] UnboundSouls: thats one of those things you dont forget seeing
[0:53:43] espi: Sadge

[0:54:08] Stretchy302: @klosterkatten Devastating, but still curious to see it
[0:54:10] espi: because of the tsunami
[0:54:11] ArthurNudge: it took me quite a while to really grasp just how many people lost their lives because of that tsunami
[0:54:14] Lutcha81: cus the factories are in thailand
[0:54:16] bansheehero: @Stretchy302 Because HDD factories were under water.
[0:54:17] SweCap: factorys was flooded
[0:54:24] AnorienNightwish: ijpHI JP and chat. Popping to say hello before FFXIV raid time
[0:54:28] Daruvik: because most HDDs are made in SE Asia
[0:54:34] UnboundSouls: stripHi
[0:54:52] bansheehero: SSD chips were fine, but the increased demand affected them as well

[0:55:01] noelsixty: Japan is still giving out warnings non-stop...guess im not sleeping tonight
[0:55:11] UnboundSouls: im on day 8 of covid, it took 6 days for it to finally start kicking my ass
[0:55:13] AnorienNightwish: @AinzN ijpSIP
[0:55:18] Sir_RobsterRoll: Western Digital got hit pretty bad
[0:55:26] HooverFan: yeah, if anything major happens to Thailand, the world PC market basically collapses, as evidenced now by COVID
[0:55:43] Necrocosm: nope at day 7 that's when it can get really bad
[0:55:49] noelsixty: yeah but the gov are mostly confused and not sure how to handle since the definition of tsunami according to their document is different from what is happening
[0:55:50] Necrocosm: or you turn the corner
[0:55:51] Darkaros: Snow storm incoming this weekend where I live PepoChamp
[0:55:52] Daruvik: that eruption probably will lead to some seismic aftershocks, so some waves will likely continue
[0:55:52] bansheehero: @UnboundSouls Good thing once it settles down. Mother had to take antivirals after 10 days of no reaction.
[0:55:56] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[0:55:57] Oresan_Fells: @noelsixty Is this because of that massive volcano explosion?
[0:56:17] OuroborosChemist: waterfront property isn't so lucrative with all the flooding and tsunamis better to build 40m above sea level and 10m above any surface of water
[0:56:29] Pentacookies: @UnboundSouls  same here day 8 >< for me
[0:56:33] espi: its day 9 you gotta watch out for
[0:56:33] Reijm11: there might be aftershocks
[0:56:45] ZcottD: wear an N95 to protect against tsunamis
[0:56:50] Galoari: day 7.. day 9.. i was down for a month last year from covid
[0:56:55] HooverFan: it wasn't a massive explosion so to speak, it was undersea...
[0:57:07] DoctorJohn: the waves do tend to get real low before they get REALLY high
[0:57:14] Cardsharp: Hey JP and Chat how is everyone!?
[0:57:14] bansheehero: Still havent started Yellowstone, but it is on my list

[0:57:37] TheRhymenoceros: The sound of the eruption was heard all the way in New Zealand
[0:57:43] noelsixty: but anyway its safe now. dunno why they still giving out warnings but ehh i'll just hang around here til they stop
[0:57:52] biglanky905: Jp you watch NFL/Playoffs?
[0:57:54] Galoari: NZ was rly close to it
[0:57:57] SweCap: Did you hear about Razors fancy mask that was not N95 at all
[0:58:00] OuroborosChemist: undersea and still managed to raise 10km tall mushroom cloud so it was a big Boom
[0:58:16] noelsixty: @noelsixty yep
[0:58:50] HooverFan: I love how Moon Knight rumors have it coming in March and the trailer premiere was during the Super Bowl, and then BOOM, trailer coming Monday

[2:48:22] ShowtimeTylers: Aaron dont be crazy now, actually moldy bread is vile
[2:48:24] OuroborosChemist: just chop the green bits off the bread and its fine
[2:48:29] PangurBanTheCat: Expiration dates are just rough estimates. There's a lot of different factors that can change how long something will last.
[2:48:30] Truder2k: expiry dates has mostly changed to "best before" date, to prevent food waste
[2:48:32] ShowtimeTylers: when bread is green, im running for the hills.
[2:48:36] ShowtimeTylers: otherwise its fine
[2:48:36] Reckless_Rob: You can save it longer but as soon as theres mold you toss it out

[2:49:39] EldritchSunny: They sell it cheaper when it's close to the epixry date over here
[2:49:44] PangurBanTheCat: Milk is obviously bad. If you have to question it then it's fine. If it smells for sure bad then it's bad.
[2:49:44] OuroborosChemist: @zymioi yea its fine for a week after expiration date based on taste if its not opened
[2:49:45] bansheehero: Chunk milk is fine, you can tell by the smell :)
