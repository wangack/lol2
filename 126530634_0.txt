[3:51:23] c9barman: hey guys, I can't find how gt played lgd, who won?
[3:51:25] HSGGisNOOB: Whos watching LPLUL
[3:51:30] pnkuU: 2-1 for GT
[3:52:14] pnkuU: @Angiefoxtrot yeah even though most people dont like him that much, i think he synergizes with frosk and dom pretty well
[3:52:24] fnask10: This is the best quality game of the day across all regions .. rng - edg just beats everything other leagues have to offer today in terms of gameplay and skill
[3:52:36] iisfish96: rng

[3:54:10] breal777: My dad is on RNG
[3:54:25] FishRoeSoup: there are rumours that chinese fans gonna bring those "polish embassy/flash wolves owe EDG iem champion" cardboards Kappa gonna see if they deliver the promise
[3:54:53] potkan0_0: SourPls
[3:55:01] pnkuU: the most important matchup will probably be mlxg and fireloli. who shows up better will quite likely win the game
[3:56:31] pnkuU: @FishRoeSoup are you maxzzie/fish or just some random guy who's twitch name starts with fish?
[3:57:29] FishRoeSoup: idk what u mean, fish roe soup is one of my favorite lunch dish
[3:58:40] RustyTheCaster: That isn't Fish :)
[3:58:41] pnkuU: oh ok, yeah there was a lpl caster who's name was fish and since a lot of casters (papa, rusty, atlus,...) come around here more or less often i thought you might be him.
[3:58:56] RustyTheCaster: Fish's name is Maxzzie in twitch
[3:59:05] beresuke: @FishRoeSoup why, were they denied entry?
[4:00:31] pnkuU: @beresuke yeah kinda. iem *** up communication to edg and edg *** up communication to fans, fans now think polish embassy is at fault while it's actually iem organisation.
[4:00:49] pnkuU: @rustythecaster the more you know :)
[4:02:13] FishRoeSoup: @beresuke not sure, have to wait updates on the forum. Considering the fans actually made trophies, medals and flags of IEM Champion and EDG did receive them, it would not be surprised if they do something crazy today 4Head
[4:04:15] FishRoeSoup: what the fk happened, i just stayed on this channel a little longer and huni is subbed out? WutFace what is going on
[4:04:33] pnkuU: who's playing now?

[4:12:44] alibabie: you guys have no idea what Chinese fans did to Clearlove after worlds, a normal person would suicide
[4:13:08] nothingishappening: don't they do this every year though?
[4:13:39] alibabie: and thats why the fans don't deserve a champion
[4:13:41] RustyTheCaster: Eh yeah Clearlove doesn't have it easy but he has support staff to help

[5:25:42] ASquishyLiquid: hows kongdoo and africa going?
[5:25:47] Mazacardo: EDG won MSI because of Clearlove
[5:25:57] Mazacardo: he was a beast at that tournament
[5:26:01] Sov25: I hope rengar gets nerfed so SKT can stop first picking it for peanut
[5:26:11] fnask10: EDG won msi because no other teams were tryhard, they were all on vacation

[5:26:17] WhiteWing789: Peanut got benched just now 4Head
[5:26:21] Mazacardo: nice excuse
[5:26:25] Sword_Art_Natsu: @mazacardo EDG was beast at that tournament.
[5:26:29] Mazacardo: NA was just bad anf Fnatic was trying hard
[5:26:32] Sov25: SKT went to MSI two days after winning spring split. Faker was sleeping during the finals and was woken up to sub in game 4.
[5:26:35] krazy2xtreme: @fnaskpojkenx nice excuse TSM on vacation?
[5:26:38] Clairfoyance: @fnaskpojkenx, BrokeBack na logic
[5:26:43] Voltiate: @sov25 at times they did. Deft was pretty bipolar with his games
[5:27:04] alibabie: Throw incoming 3 2 1
[5:27:10] fnask10: edg cant even beat rng who middle team in group A
[5:27:18] FatalSajko: fed camille GG tyler1NLT
[5:27:19] Sov25: @TyfloHawk Deft does well if you put all the eggs in his basket. Camp him, give him all the farm, and give him a frontline.
[5:27:22] alibabie: rng is bottom, GT is top
[5:27:22] Mazacardo: RNG is first in group A what are you talking about
[5:27:37] rodricide: weird trist build
[5:27:46] Clairfoyance: @fnaskpojkenx, RNG is 1st in their grp FailFish
[5:28:03] fnask10: ye sure, dont lie if you dont have any proof
[5:28:18] Sov25: @Terrorsq You can respect what he did domestically like dyrus, doesn't mean they aren't boosted animals compare to world class players :)
[5:28:25] Mazacardo: RNG is first you cant argue facts dude
[5:28:26] Matthielele: this throw FailFish
[5:28:26] Voltiate: @sov25 yes, the problem is that it became predictable and teams would prey on that to etheir shut down deft or snowball the rest of the map
[5:28:36] Clairfoyance: @fnaskpojkenx, i linked it FailFish RNG 5-1 FailFish
[5:28:47] ASquishyLiquid: dyrus used to be the best top in thte world
[5:29:01] tak4da: Gg EDG(((
[5:29:11] Asystolie: dyrus is *** LUL
[5:29:14] Sov25: @TyfloHawk Yea I know. Just saying that is typically when deft looks good, he gets a ton of resources invested. He's never done well when he's asked to get less resources.
[5:29:16] fnask10: Ok, but how can you say they are best because they are 1st? maybe they had easier games than other teams in the group
[5:29:37] WhiteWing789: are they playing at 7.4?
[5:29:40] Sov25: LUL
[5:29:42] RustyTheCaster: lol

[5:29:51] henrysyd: lmao
[5:29:52] Clairfoyance: @fnaskpojkenx, because they are 1st in their gro FailFish whats ur logic FailFish 1st in current standing = currently best
[5:29:53] ztttc: LUL
[5:29:55] WhiteWing789: Trist what are you doing FailFish

[5:31:02] alibabie: now he's angry uzi
[5:31:04] WhiteWing789: @Birmz_Aaron, we have season 1 ? 4Head
[5:31:13] Sov25: @Terrorsq That's like when people called doublelift the best adc when the competitive scene was very premature
[5:31:14] VoHiYo_KreyGasm: lol who's arguing that Dyrus is one of the best, he must be trolling
[5:31:17] 水枪呆毛: why tsm doesn't have skin？

[5:31:49] Its80hd: did uzi first item BORK?
[5:31:50] Sov25: @Terrorsq Season 2 LUL
[5:31:57] VoHiYo_KreyGasm: @Sov25, Yeah Doublelift actually was mechanically near unmatched in a season that actually saw competitiveness
[5:31:57] Its80hd: or cleaver first
[5:31:59] WhiteWing789: Script Camille PogChamp
[5:32:13] Lifemekhanism: BOTRK

[5:32:19] prigovor_: Duke EleGiggle
[5:32:20] Sov25: @VoHiYo_KreyGasm The competition before Korea had their own server
[5:32:33] VoHiYo_KreyGasm: You can argue that Koreans wern't fully developed in season 2, doesn't change the fact that he was really really good compared to eveyrone else at the time
[5:32:37] Voltiate: UZI has one of the worst cases of tunnel vision I've ever seen
[5:32:50] juicetannnn: i dont understand the cleaver tho
[5:33:00] WhiteWing789: @TyfloHawk, i think a lot of adc players play while holding their spaces most of the time
[5:33:01] Sov25: @VoHiYo_KreyGasm My point isn't that he wasn't the best S2. My point is when people act like it's an achievement.
[5:33:06] Its80hd: I habent seen a trist in a while but I like thay he isnt going crit build tbh
[5:33:07] rodricide: zzzz
[5:33:15] vinsmokekw: Why EDG?
[5:33:21] vinsmokekw: wake up!
[5:33:25] ASquishyLiquid: thats like saying that pele is a boosted animal compared to messi
[5:33:42] Fr3nd0: VoHiYo
[5:33:56] VoHiYo_KreyGasm: Except it is an achievement, season 2 was extremely competitive between the regions and still a major part of LoL history
[5:34:05] WhiteWing789: i dont think uzi will have enough damage with this kind of itemization .. o_o
[5:34:08] fnask10: Is uzi trying to make a case for being the dumbest adc in the world with his build?
[5:34:09] VoHiYo_KreyGasm: Would you discount M5 and CLG.EU's achievements in season 2?
[5:34:31] vinsmokekw: @ASquishyLiquid Racist junk

[5:34:37] decoyoce: @fnaskpojkenx And yet hes 6/2/1 that probably said somthing about the effectiveness of his build
[5:34:40] Voltiate: @whitewing789 that shouldn't matter because you should be aware of what's on the map constantly
[5:34:45] muslimituristi: dat trist build

[5:34:59] wallslikeme: tristana?
[5:35:01] Sov25: Importance*
[5:35:05] vinsmokekw: Tristana is so good

[5:35:26] vinsmokekw: look at explsion
[5:35:27] RustyTheCaster: so he's gonna range everybody soon

[5:41:45] dareboy92: yeah contractz can be trsah sometimes but he is not that bad in general I think
[5:41:46] Sov25: @eu_w_gnar 100% agree Perkz is MVP

[5:42:33] eu_w_gnar: @Sov25 Im sure they will win world s7 Kappa

[5:44:42] Sov25: @TyfloHawk Honestly I don't mind lane swaps until EU laneswaps occured. It had strategy on executing certain unique comps. EU laneswaps made it where you were forced to do it every time while laning phase

[5:52:15] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, what makes u think kramer wanted to be in EDG 🤔
[5:52:24] wanijyek: Who will win?
[5:52:27] pnkuU: edg has some koreans
[5:52:32] weebonduty: who will lose?
[5:52:34] pnkuU: rng has none
[5:52:38] juicetannnn: hes on afreeca
[5:52:41] weebonduty: you decide
[5:52:43] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, hes doing well on AF
[5:52:55] alibabie: EDG has good history of quality imports, it was not popularity contest
[5:52:55] weebonduty: epic league battle of history
[5:52:56] wyxf321: full Chinese this year
[5:53:06] everyoneelseistrash0: Actually, Chinese team sign Korean player just to save money, famous Chinese players need more money like PDD, go going
[5:53:15] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, ofrourse, zet was mid laner just last season
[5:53:50] wyxf321: thoes retired player??
[5:53:58] ASquishyLiquid: also maybe they sign koreans cause theyre bettter
[5:54:00] alibabie: Only if players like slmz come over to EDG, there aren't any good ADC around for sale in China
[5:54:31] weebonduty: if that grill has a boyfriend, I will post the picture of my D on this chat
[5:54:32] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, Deft into Zet Kappa gd decision
[5:54:41] alibabie: i feel OMG is wasting smlz and icon
[5:54:55] rodricide: @bestadcuuzzii, famous Chinese players need more money than korean big names like imp?
[5:55:21] Clairfoyance: CN is literally live by uzi, die by uzi, only player to challenge koreans on multiple occasion
[5:55:46] everyoneelseistrash0: Many Talented Chinese player like Uzi don't play professional game but stream to make more money. If these player can play LPL, Korean team can't win world. Trust me
[5:56:06] alibabie: @rl4n in some cases yes, because demand and supply, Chinese player don't take up the only 2 import requirement of the rolster, so in a way quality Chinese players are more valuable in the eyes of the clubs
[5:56:10] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, keep in mind, OG got 0-20 in career mid laner 4Head
[5:56:41] weebonduty: GT is alive 4Head
[5:56:46] SnooKappa: Both of these casters LUL
[5:57:23] everyoneelseistrash0: Talented player like PDD and gogoing just retire and don't want to play LPL because of money
[5:57:36] FatalSajko: HotPokket HotPokket
[5:57:40] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, i thought OG was big 🤔
[5:57:47] alibabie: and also because LPL as a organisation is quite corrupted
[5:57:49] everyoneelseistrash0: Wexiao lovelin same thing
[5:57:51] weebonduty: Pulse hair DansGame
[5:57:57] juicetannnn: "see you next time fam" id never thought id see that on an lpl stream
[5:58:08] Clairfoyance: @bestadcuuzzii, hope ur joking 4Head
[5:58:28] pnkuU: SourPls
[5:58:30] Europa_012: im late.. did it went 2-0?
[5:58:37] pnkuU: yes
[5:58:37] uzi_in_2017: sourpls
[5:58:43] Europa_012: deyum
[5:58:55] 搞个大新闻: did RNG win?
[5:59:01] everyoneelseistrash0: @anonuuu not joking , currently there many Chinese account on top KR server rank. They are mostly streamer 4Head
[5:59:06] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, they went all the way to quarters tho
[5:59:22] alibabie: @bestadcuuzzii solo q and pro play is completely different
[5:59:23] Clairfoyance: @bestadcuuzzii, no region will ever come close to beating KR LUL ever
[5:59:30] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, yea semi
[5:59:43] 搞个大新闻: did clearlove play in the game?
[5:59:55] alibabie: Maybe LPL can one day catch up, but i doubt that when it happens LoL as a game is still relevant
[5:59:59] Clairfoyance: @Presidentxijinping, hes retired LUL no
[6:00:39] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, yea but, success = more fans and that means more sponsors, OG has lot of fans
[6:00:56] 搞个大新闻: Hes not retired actually, he's still an official player of edg now@anonuuu
[6:01:11] Clairfoyance: @Presidentxijinping, doesnt mean he'll play anytime
[6:01:38] Midl4nekingdom: is this today?
[6:01:41] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, then what makes LUL
[6:01:51] Clairfoyance: @JinAirKuzan, no, its over
[6:01:59] Midl4nekingdom: ty
[6:01:59] 搞个大新闻: @anonuuu it's a important game, i suppose he would show up for this
[6:02:30] Clairfoyance: @Presidentxijinping, yes, its important, thats y EDG played their main jger
[6:03:10] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, then i dont see how investing is profitable LUL
[6:03:12] 搞个大新闻: fireloli is not necessarily better than clearlove
[6:03:50] pnkuU: but he's not that bad either @搞个大新闻
[6:03:52] alibabie: @anonuu In China, the streaming industry is different, unlike twitch pretty much a monopoly, the streaming platforms in China is in extreme contest for market shares, and they pay HUGE sums of money to sign famous streamer to stream at their platform, so a lot of streamers like PDD makes huge amount of money by signing the contracts to streaming platforms.
[6:04:25] Clairfoyance: @alibabie, ok, but chinese players are not as gd as koreans
[6:04:32] alibabie: yea ofc
[6:04:44] alibabie: Koreans train 10x harder than Chinese players
[6:04:50] Clairfoyance: they might be the richest, but they arent the best
[6:05:02] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, NotLikeThis
[6:05:34] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, and how is LGD profitable for him Kappa
[6:05:45] alibabie: there is 2 levels to it, solo q, and pro scene, in solo q, you can debate about which region is harder to be masters, but in pro scene, no region is near KR
[6:06:16] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, then they should give up pro scene and stream full tiem Kappa
[6:06:42] alibabie: in solo q, China region is more competitive by nature due to raw numbers of players, but yea KR professional gaming industry is too good to beat
[6:06:59] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, but they are doing pretty bad, how would they have fans
[6:07:40] alibabie: @anonuuu kinda like streamers such as box box or else, they put up good shows, but doesn't mean they have to be very very good
[6:07:47] Moobot: No links allowed (marioisfun12) (warning)
[6:08:05] Clairfoyance: @alibabie, but he isnt pro
