[2:58:28] thesestrangenotions: As a player this is terrifying
[2:58:32] DoodlestheGreat: @windgod2000 The Bethesda deal didn't leak, either. MS has a long history of playing things close to the chest.
[2:58:34] Galoari: lol COD is hardcore? xD
[2:58:35] pc2400: Personally the more AAA on game pass gives me more money to buy indies

[2:59:38] crazyt4c0: how is too big bad, more games for "free"
[2:59:39] JumpsOO4: the fact they could do this with all cash is mind bending to me
[2:59:40] raptorscream: @itmeJP Phil said in an interview with Giant Bomb, that he dosent want to go all Gamepass, and digital/hard Disc buy will still be a thing
[2:59:41] yrvengalied: MS feels like its gonna own the market if these acquisitions keeps being allowed not only MS though just to be clear
[2:59:45] ThemDemo: This is as if Netflix bought NBC, ABC, etc. rather than contract out shows and movies
[2:59:46] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour.

[2:59:55] Insigmada: actablizzsoft
[2:59:55] DoodlestheGreat: @pukventuk THAT would be the move that scares everyone.
[2:59:57] thesestrangenotions: MS got one with Bethesda, now I have my sus hairs raised on the back of my neck
[3:00:03] JumpsOO4: @Poriand never say never, no one saw this coming
[3:00:03] zebracak35: @itmejp I believe this move is more around mobile than gamepas. Windows presence in the mobile space is quite weak where as activision iss quite big
[3:00:08] Zaelsus: Imagine a WoW sub using gamepass
[3:00:09] MrTrotty: anti trust in NA KEKW
[3:00:09] OuroborosChemist: they get as many ips as game pass as possible and ppl will get those then they triple the monthly fee
[3:00:13] Zaalri: i don't think they could legally afford steam, that WOULD be a monopoly
[3:00:13] Sonatta: WoW subs could totally move to Gamepass and they just sell expansions, like TESO
[3:00:20] EightBitDelight: tbh, Microsoft has been good to everyone they have acquired up to now. This might be very good
[3:00:20] mexican_computer: monkaHmm

[3:00:23] MILESkg21: Hmm
[3:00:24] afiqltd: Hmm
[3:00:27] h3ybrian: But what’s not being said is how many people still buy the game and support it with dlc purchases bc they no longer have to buy the game
[3:00:27] eggnewb: 'starting monopoly vibe'
[3:00:30] yrvengalied: so that is the Loop
[3:00:30] Collected1: i think wow subs still make far too much money to roll them into game pass
[3:00:35] Zaelsus: Also, would they increase the price of Gamepass at some point? stripHmm
[3:00:36] bastionsan: Hmm
[3:00:36] Shapelessdnb: monkaHmm
[3:00:46] Thrishmal: I just want them to steal the Blizzard launcher for the windows store since it sucks so hard
[3:00:50] Notenoughcoffee: problem is then most important stuff on games will be GaaS, not quality stuff. like say goodbye to good story-driven
[3:00:55] raptorscream: @itmeJP Phil said in an interview with Giant Bomb (2 years ago), that he dosent want to go all Gamepass, and digital/hard Disc buy will still be a thing
[3:01:03] afiqltd: Hmm monkaHmm
[3:01:04] yrvengalied: the way they can bypass the anti trust law
[3:01:04] h3ybrian: If Disney is allowed then Microsoft can
[3:01:06] OuroborosChemist: if anti trust isnt doing thing on google, amazon and apple this merge is minor as comparison
[3:01:10] dumbalex: Steam could almost be looked at as a monopoly too
[3:01:15] raptorscream: ^
[3:01:16] Insigmada: monopoly, microsoft never got in trouble for that before ijpHMM
[3:01:18] LegendsOfBobby: @Collected1 ive been playing WoW since the day it came out. the day it switched to being able to buy game time with gold ive never paid for a single month. they dont make they much
[3:01:24] Brandling: @Notenoughcoffee WutFace
[3:01:33] DyingEros: Steam is a monopoly that gamers don't want to admit to
[3:01:38] raptorscream: yeah
[3:01:38] DaRandalizer: I guess, it might be also a cost cutting action. They can shorten AAA games and thus costs because they have so many strong ips now.
[3:01:41] yrvengalied: its feels like its comes a full circle
[3:01:46] Collected1: LegendsOfBobby : yeah but they make money from that gold too
[3:01:49] afreak10: which is good and bad
[3:01:53] Chromasphere_: wow ads
[3:01:56] raptorscream: @DyingEros and they get so hyped for it, that they hate everything else by default
[3:01:56] Z3r0Fear: Starcraft Ghost

[3:02:17] LegendsOfBobby: @Collected1 how are they making money off the gold i get from using the AH?
[3:02:19] Poriand: @legendsofbobby so wrong
[3:02:21] pr_necroskull: fps Starcraft, mmo starcraft
[3:02:24] 14neo: oh snap ijpMONKA or ijpPOGGERS to have that? no idea
[3:02:26] afiqltd: COPIUM SC Ghost
[3:02:28] tylawd: I guess I would counter that (also I'm dumb so feel free to say it) These games can be bought through other vendors, they just get included with game pass. As someone who uses multiple platforms to purchase and launch games, I don't really see this turning in to a negative unless they restrict access to the games themselves TO gamepass only vs selling them via conventional means
[3:02:28] Flashx2: Starcraft 3 plz COPIUM
[3:02:28] Againstmike: my brain just melted from that statement LUL

[3:02:43] Poriand: @legendsofbobby someone is buying that token with money to get gold

[3:02:59] Daruvik: JP's new show coming 2023: "State of the Gamepass" COPIUM
[3:03:00] raptorscream: and no new ips
[3:03:01] OneUnknownGuy: Starcraft 2 Patch COPIUM
[3:03:01] yrvengalied: @yrvengalied all Laws leave a loophole with the wording being chosen when said law is made
[3:03:01] pc2400: Why is it scary for the indie side?
[3:03:02] DagooX: can they buy EA too for Command&Conquer? Kappa
[3:03:05] thesestrangenotions: @tylawd They did that with Bethesda properties moving forward
[3:03:11] MrMX0121: If Mircosoft continue buying AAA companies Game Pass will cost $30 bucks or more.
[3:03:12] Craylith: @tylawd But why would people pay for a game when they can just play it for "free" through their Gamepass subscription?
[3:03:17] DerfOnTurf: State of the Gamepass LUL
[3:03:19] afiqltd: LUL
[3:03:19] DorianCahan: There’s so much pressure on MS to revive dead games
[3:03:20] ETS05: how does this convo apply to this case though, ABK doesnt publish indy games
[3:03:26] Collected1: LegendsOfBobby : well what i meant is the token you buy with gold was bought by someone who wants that gold
[3:03:36] thesestrangenotions: @yrvengalied that's my point. they are specifically made to be broken in the US
[3:03:38] DerfOnTurf: Poor indies Sadge
[3:03:38] raptorscream: also MS is 3rd in the market share for gaming
[3:04:03] DannyDeVitosHairline: more games on gamepass i.e activsion games means people are less likely to play the indies on gamepass.
[3:04:07] Siggenlh: that arguemtn is so bad. we are nto amonoply. we just have 2/3 of all the bigger studios
[3:04:10] tylawd: @tylawd but if i can still BUY It through the MS store or w/e vs ONLY being able to play it with a sub to game pass I still wouldn't say thats any different than what devs/distributors do now like Epic/Sony/Blizzard etc
[3:04:18] JWoody82: EU antitrust authorities are much more active
[3:04:21] Saryuken: Europe stopping progress once again...
[3:04:26] freetownJoe: DansGame
[3:04:33] yrvengalied: the only thing they can say about Anti Trust is the Horizontal Anti Trust and its a weak claim if used
[3:04:34] tylawd: @tylawd You could say that about any media or subscription based service. I don't see how this acquisition changes the concept.
[3:04:35] Daruvik: so more WoWs
[3:04:38] ryukenchi: i dont want that. i want to be able to just buy a game.
[3:04:39] SgtStruthers: Microsoft put most games on steam no?
[3:04:39] Hikyy: that's why mmo come back
[3:04:40] Siggenlh: its a reason why they say its about the metaverse and not videogames.to skirt around antitrust.
[3:04:49] ryukenchi: i dont want to have to sub to be able to play a game
[3:04:52] ryukenchi: thats stupid
[3:04:55] ResponseFox: Microsoft will own Battle.net after this aswell i wonder how this will change, maybe it merges with the windows store?
[3:04:57] afiqltd: Sadge
[3:05:00] raptorscream: MS also put their games on Steam, so there's that
[3:05:01] ZombieInaCostco: Do we think gamepass will go up in price soonish?
[3:05:05] DannyDeVitosHairline: wow subscription being free with gamepass ultimate/ pc would be the tits.
[3:05:07] DagooX: for indies gamepass could be a problem, because gamers could begin think "I don't want to pay $15-20-30 when I can get gamepass with lot of games a lot cheaper"
[3:05:12] afiqltd: NOPERS
[3:05:12] AntoniusJD: @yrvengalied I don't think it's as weak as you think, but I agree that the deal will go through in the US
[3:05:15] yrvengalied: True
[3:05:19] gorlork: Dogshit? Kappa
[3:05:22] Shapelessdnb: dumpster fire?

[3:05:29] thesestrangenotions: That was my biggest thing. Why do business with those bad people
[3:05:31] wanderingman: kotick getting a parachute
[3:05:33] OuroborosChemist: well being under fire is the reason Microsoft was able to buy
[3:05:34] spirouac: MS owns Daemonware now, which in my opinion is bigger than battle.net
[3:05:35] DannyDeVitosHairline: atleast bobby kotick will fuck off.
[3:05:37] afiqltd: DansGame kotick
[3:05:43] SuperKarti: according to Bloomberg Microsoft handled that like a vulture in the business sense. Sees a wounded company and pulls out the gun
[3:05:46] yrvengalied: @AntoniusJD it will be down played to look weak
[3:05:48] DerfOnTurf: A dumpstire fire shit show NODDERS
[3:05:50] thesestrangenotions: @DannyDeVitosHairline that relieved me
[3:05:50] Poriand: Microsoft buying the dip honestly
[3:06:00] Sonatta: i think that's exactly what happened, the owners are bailing out
[3:06:00] GrannySith: $70 billion might be worth it to get rid of Bobby. 🤷

[3:06:32] xhaven: You say this Jp but didnt RiOT games settle their lawsuit for $100M and everyone has forgiven them.
[3:06:33] pc2400: now the stock is sky rocketing
[3:06:37] afiqltd: true LUL
[3:06:37] AntoniusJD: @itmeJP DOJ Press Release specifically mentions the Monopsony problem Rami mentioned. Very interesting.
[3:06:45] itmeJP: yrven read twitter DM
[3:06:54] Truder2k: actiblizz would probably never be less expensive to take over than now... so it'd be now or never
[3:07:04] GrannySith: @yrvengalied wasn't he gonna get a similar amount of money even if he was fired?
[3:07:17] OuroborosChemist: but such is the way capitalism and corporatism works
[3:07:24] InternetPlumber: welcome to Corporate life
[3:07:26] raptorscream: Activision was at it lowest now, wait longer and maybe someone else would take it, worst case, Sony (worst case for ms)
[3:07:36] MILESkg21: just enough to buy another yacht KEKW
[3:07:36] afiqltd: DansGame FBBlock kotick
[3:07:54] Mallatom: Rami POGGIES
[3:08:00] duen75: there were rumors FB was looking to buy as well. So MS is..better?
[3:08:00] tomacomics: A lot of questions about how Sony and PlayStation can compete in the future.
[3:08:19] AntoniusJD: Yeah don't forget Bobby is still a non-executive director over at Coca-Cola
[3:08:22] mett7: kotick dont need more money, his already filthy rich
[3:08:27] droogydroo: it's absolutely a poisoned chalice
[3:08:31] Qutip: Microsoft should get rid of the Activision name
[3:08:45] lStarkx: they own wow and eso
[3:08:46] droogydroo: question is what they do with it now
[3:09:04] raptorscream: Phil was just promoted, he better flex on them
[3:09:11] Gnomeleader213: I mean, not entirely right? Like they can run so many angles to show that Blizzard "is in new hands"
[3:09:12] wampastomppa: people have a short memory, and this is enough of a point in time change that people will be like "different company, different expectations"
[3:09:12] HahaHazer: When I first saw the news everyone was excited cuz MS just obtained a bunch of big IPs so i dont think its a disaster per se
[3:09:13] DangerousClam: honestly its kind of perfect for a buyer. they can clean house and pass blame
[3:09:17] lStarkx: wouldnt it be called just microsoft blizzard now? or just blizzards idk
[3:09:31] Elder_Evil: next comes Kotick's book and seminar "How to create a toxic workplace and get paid doing it"
[3:09:35] Qutip: Blizzard has been lovced in the past BY many
[3:09:37] deSheepy: aren't Activision on strike
[3:09:39] OuroborosChemist: well after they purge all the associated ppl its fine for Microsoft doesn't matter too much even if few good ones not involved go with it
[3:09:40] raptorscream: @lStarkx it's not merger, it's aquisitions
[3:09:43] DeusSilvam_2: It would be crazy if Phil would let the existing good will go to waste by not cleaning house and making sure stuff gets fixed
[3:09:49] Qutip: Activision has always been hated
[3:10:03] DorianCahan: I would love for the good devs to come back to blizzard after
[3:10:04] DoodlestheGreat: They need the union even more now.
[3:10:07] AntoniusJD: @lStarkx ABK was bought, not merged
[3:10:07] raptorscream: Sony said "dont do that" and nothing happened, Phil said they'll revaluate, and it was 69mil
[3:10:27] DyingEros: A weird sentiment, I really hope that Phil is doing the right thing. That he hears us and knows that he could be a bastion of the future of gaming
[3:10:32] DyingEros: Please. Don't turn on us Phil
[3:10:46] Amazhulaan: cirBless We trust in Phil
[3:10:49] JBfromAccounting: KEKW
[3:10:49] AntoniusJD: @DyingEros Putting your hopes into a corporate executive KEKW

[3:11:02] yse14: @AntoniusJD thats what amazing PR does
[3:11:06] Verbittert: no one expects the microsoft acquisition
[3:11:08] DyingEros: @AntoniusJD I know. I feel the kek as well but I have to have hope.
[3:11:08] InternetPlumber: keep in mind chat that this is an acquisition proposal that hasn't been approved or has closed
[3:11:11] AntoniusJD: @yse14 Agreed
[3:11:21] InternetPlumber: between now and then MS can't do anything
[3:11:24] Miklagard: But what if phil leaves and for example a kotik follows him monkaS
[3:11:25] de_pauli: Phil won't be on Microsoft forever also. What happens after he leaves?
[3:11:33] Joulupukin: I think Electronic Arts is the next company Microsoft is looking to buy in 2013-2015 timeline
[3:11:34] AntoniusJD: @DyingEros I hear ya!
[3:11:34] DorianCahan: Phil has to answer to a board

[3:24:22] Flashx2: xbox with call of duty bundles will be huge
[3:24:26] thesestrangenotions: I feel like that Sony needs to get more aggressive on its Movie/TV exploration or get two major publishers to stay as relevant in games
[3:24:27] osakey: That is such an absurd amount of money
[3:24:28] Sad0wl: now its question how long sonny can survive on exclusives only
[3:24:28] drunkencpt: I have limited time to play, so I have no issues just paying for 1 to 2 exclusives, so Ill go where there's a game that interests me
[3:24:36] InternetPlumber: anything Sony acquires you have to assume it will be exclusive
[3:24:37] raptorscream: Sony's options are SE, Capcom or From Software

[3:28:42] GraveSalad: multiplayer games are fighting to get on XGP, you completely sidestep the usual issue of getting people to start playing so your community doesn't death spiral
[3:28:46] BananaJoe1701: Halo had also huge launch. How many people are still playing that?
[3:28:49] ramnax188: @yrvengalied they would have to get the wow team to get there shit together first

[3:29:43] Insigmada: Don't sony have IPs that are sourced too activision
[3:29:45] Ndelirium: awesome*
[3:29:45] ThemDemo: Sony partnering with Deviation Games (ex-COD devs) was a smart move LUL
[3:29:47] KingBoyle1_: I personally think these moves are bad for gaming in general
[3:29:50] nicklepolaroid: @ProBMFK Mixer is dead
[3:29:50] yrvengalied: @ramnax188 well before that they will need to clean house so they are on the way if they start to clean house
[3:29:51] GraveSalad: @ProBMFK Mixer is dead so unlikely

[3:30:14] zacekmx: remember all the new studios parneships that PS announced last year, there were alot FPS focus studios
[3:30:19] zynessa: @ProBMFK Wacky conspiracy, but yes, Sony can do this right now too.
[3:30:31] ProBMFK: @nicklepolaroid mixer might be dead but copyright isn't they just force you to stream on their prefered platform or you get striked
[3:30:38] Wolf: paid in exposure LUL
[3:30:40] thesestrangenotions: They already do that essentially

[3:31:12] afiqltd: hasn't even been a month LUL
[3:31:12] nicklepolaroid: @ProBMFK Hasn't happened because they don't own a platform. They could've done it with Halo and didn't
[3:31:14] ProBMFK: @Braideraid but with a monopoly what can consumers do?
[3:31:19] afreak10: PepeLaugh
[3:31:19] el_libre: dude thats crazy to think that all these activision accounts made via COD will now be converted to Microsoft accounts
[3:31:20] Sonatta: 2 largest? Microsoft said HOLD MY BEER LUL

[3:31:38] kibriel: where are federal regulators in all this?
[3:31:45] Braideraid: @ProBMFK that idea is so farfetched that I don't think it's worth discussing
[3:31:46] raptorscream: 9
[3:31:56] Mishymac: Maybe Sony will focus on the hardware like they seem to already be doing with PSVR2 and xbox seems not to care about hardware anymore
[3:31:57] MILESkg21: somebody plz buy Take Two and make a proper GTA remaster Kappa
[3:31:58] ThunderCcat: Maybe Sony go back to making a MAG game
[3:32:00] ProBMFK: lol chat it's a monopoly. you don't need 100% of market for a monopooly
[3:32:02] griff_ow: they talked about candy crush I assume
[3:32:05] AntoniusJD: @kibriel DOJ made an announcement today, looking to change merger and acquisition regs, I can DM link if you want
[3:32:07] BlueSapphyre: @kibriel getting paid to ignore it.

[3:33:21] MILESkg21: MICRO-CON ??
[3:33:23] yrvengalied: Exclusives
[3:33:25] nicklepolaroid: Japan has strict laws so non-Japanese companies CAN'T buy Japanese companies. So Microsoft won't be able to buy Capcom or whatever
[3:33:26] DJSketch04: @itmeJP what happens to Blizzcon?
[3:33:27] BlazeRom: oh my god that's right Blizzcon is dead
[3:33:37] Killercds: @itmeJP On DF, Rami made a lot of points about user spending data from the Zynga acquisition, do you think the same applies here with King?

[3:33:49] Klassicoops: MS E3 will be insane in the future
[3:33:49] nijntuu: why not do a game pass conference themselfs
[3:33:51] InternetPlumber: MS doesn't care about the console wara. Xbox is a vehicle for game pass. they would love for game pass to be on PlayStation
[3:33:53] kce_blackwolf: @itmeJP  what happens to blizzaedcon
[3:33:54] Turbologic: Blizzcon was already dead after all these thing

[3:34:06] kooshy_j: bliizard killed it itself LUL
[3:34:08] ralphfromdk: Didn't blizzcon kill itself?
[3:34:09] Myr_01: wasn't it already dead?
[3:34:09] zynessa: @SgtMckay Because it is literally not going to happen. If they wanted to do what you're describing, they would have done it when, you know, they still had a streaming platform.
[3:34:10] OcGhost: You mean Overwatch League Con
[3:34:12] OranHexthief: thats blizzcon and quakecon under MS now
[3:34:13] InternetPlumber: XCon

[3:35:03] freaktechnik: blizzconline part of gamepass?
[3:35:20] Dredstryde: ^
[3:35:21] ProBMFK: @zynessa you think so? Maybe I'm just jaded. I don't think anything is out of question when you're dealing with this much money
[3:35:29] Yatchmonkey: could sony afford epic games?
[3:35:32] DoodlestheGreat: @DoodlestheGreat That's how they know! :tf:

[3:35:49] Turbologic: @Yatchmonkey nope Tencent owns big part of Epic
[3:35:51] BelieveItMD: Assuming other gaming studios predict Sony’s knee jerk reaction to get new acquisitions, could they up their price since Sony might be desperate?
[3:35:53] smariton: what about battle.net @itmeJP ?
[3:35:59] Siggenlh: overwatch their last new IP proper LUL

[3:36:08] Desarleon: @yatchmonkey that's tencent for the most part so no
[3:36:09] Darkaros: I don't see how Battle.net gets touched. Bethesda still has their dumb launcher smariton
[3:36:12] raptorscream: Xbox COn
[3:36:15] zynessa: @ProBMFK Nothing has changed when it comes to streaming. Especially incentives to start copyright striking streamers. If anything, the situation has become less likely to end up like you're proposing, because Microsoft have *literally* nothing to gain from that.
