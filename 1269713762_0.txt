[0:59:25] kenguin35: @lunarwolffff RNG, EDG, BLG
[0:59:36] erixenlol: Edg fpx rng blg tes
[0:59:39] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: @bossnno he actually looks way better this year
[0:59:40] kenguin35: maybe LNG
[0:59:50] theeelegendhimself: How bad does this new int?
[0:59:58] Kad3nza: @lunarwolffff EDG, ENG, LNG, BLG, TES
[1:00:01] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: rng nah

[1:00:11] kenguin35: i cant seriously rate TES as a worlds contender with how Zhuo runs it down in game
[1:00:12] NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING: RNG AND LNG LOOKING SUS TO ME LUL
[1:00:25] bossnno: @lunarwolffff RNG, EDG, LNG, TES?, BLG?, WBG?, FPX?
[1:00:29] bluesclues96: they seem good wdym
[1:00:49] kenguin35: @NA_NEVER_WON_ANYTHING based on performance for sure i'd rate fpx higher but based on roster id say they have the most starpower
[1:00:56] bossnno: you have to put RNG and LNG because those rosters are good and its still very early in the split
[1:01:07] captainkrajick: @theeelegendhimself How bad is your English? What are you saying?
[1:01:27] sephiroxical19981202: RNG right now looks like Xiaohu 1v9

[1:03:31] bluesclues96: bin inted pretty hard too
[1:03:32] bossnno: i think rng's struggles are based on them playing knowing their midlaner will ditch anything to help them which doesnt happen with xiaohu anymore
