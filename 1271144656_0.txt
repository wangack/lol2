[2:18:29] Tronix_604: @archangel3003  that's for pro league, they play a patch or 2 delayed, so new Champs can't be chosen till like 2-3 weeks after their initial release so they can tweak if needed, ranked has never had restrictions

[2:35:21] galdamesh: shen legit just got nerfed...
[2:35:24] drunkencpt: And lvled at the same time
[2:35:28] Shoaron: @Darkaros i'm talking about the games i've played
[2:35:33] daaheq: lets go rivershen
[2:35:33] Seejo_Crux: oop
[2:35:34] Fiendmaw: Is Rengar still as ignorant as ever?
[2:35:46] Darkaros: @Shoaron ohh I missed the "I" lol
[2:35:46] Archangel3003: I fought one that just seemed to tank everything I hit him with while just doing stupid damage to me like 5 minutes into game
[2:35:51] slickwattle: peepoClap points!
[2:36:04] JBfromAccounting: rengar jumping in and out of bushes will be annoying as shit
[2:36:22] Darkaros: Who's getting the first tower? predict now
[2:36:30] Gank4CE1: f? or me
[2:36:34] afreak10: this is crazy
[2:36:37] Gank4CE1: Sadge
[2:36:37] 14neo: oh no ijpMONKA
[2:36:38] Kaleith: @Gank4CE1 yeah a bit
[2:36:38] miirro4: small f yea
[2:36:41] loki15kun: I was going to ask about it

[2:36:45] Seejo_Crux: Why would someone bother
[2:36:49] AinzN: Yeah something is fucky!
[2:36:49] afreak10: no way this is random
[2:36:52] ReginaldXIV: Looking sus now
[2:36:53] JustLetItBe: same here
[2:36:55] FluentZap: That's not fucking cool...
[2:36:56] Takagnor: use nordvpn
[2:36:58] drunkencpt: I dont know whats' going on with league this patch, same things happens to me. Just look at jps fps counter
[2:37:00] Kyriac: could it be because youre uploading YT vids?
[2:37:02] GraveSalad: @Seejo_Crux the answer is always cause they can
[2:37:15] Archangel3003: @Seejo_Crux Have yo  spent time on the Internet much?
[2:37:22] Archangel3003: you*
[2:37:23] ReginaldXIV: @Takagnor but what code do I use for a free 14 days? ijpHMM
[2:37:26] seatea07: didnt even know that was still a thing that people did anymore, stupid kids
[2:37:30] Seejo_Crux: I kinda assume the average human is decent but maybe I'm wrong.
[2:37:33] Veilshadow: Is blitz bad to use?
[2:37:35] ArcticCheetah: @itmejp even while playing lol offstream?
[2:37:40] ApathyOwl: double buffs? monkaS
[2:37:50] Darkaros: Veilshadow probably just preference
[2:37:54] Darkaros: !app
[2:37:54] itmeBOT: JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[2:37:54] AinzN: Bet it was that Yorick mid from the other day
[2:37:55] SiriusNick: how did they get your ip?
[2:38:07] GrievAY: He most likely have a very high speed fiber connection, shouldnt affect utlovad to game or youtube
[2:38:14] Gank4CE1: the average human? yes. league veiwers? no.
[2:38:16] GrievAY: Upload
[2:38:42] br4nd0nh347: they all do that top, so cheap
[2:38:44] galdamesh: no grey health tahm nerfs too much :(
[2:38:44] ghostsofcarcosa: @SiriusNick Could be targeted at ISP or something more general. Though I'm no expert on this stuff.
[2:38:46] Keyah: That's what they do
[2:39:04] Archangel3003: Yup I went against one and he just run back and forth that bush diving me. Pissed me right off
[2:39:05] drunkencpt: It's the only thing they can do. Once they're under your or their tower they're pretty useless
[2:39:08] psychic_ward: all he does is jump in and out of bushes?
[2:39:26] GrievAY: Yup and roams to ult
[2:39:37] Archangel3003: Yeah his passive gives him some benefit from it @psychic_ward
[2:39:50] johnfive21: This Rengo is really good
[2:40:03] johnfive21: for this elo

[2:42:32] ZMightyCheeba: Unbench the kench Pog
[2:42:43] Kaleith: the stream also Fs every time it happens so it's not just the game

[3:00:50] MeddlerMaz: Top can in fact carry lol
[3:00:58] Darkaros: titanodin ijpHI
[3:01:13] ghostsofcarcosa: @MeddlerMaz Said Tahm can't carry not top.
[3:01:18] Jukettaja: Tahp
[3:01:22] ReginaldXIV: Top KEKW
[3:01:24] Seejo_Crux: Top Kench?
[3:01:24] epicshoo: Pepega tahp carry
[3:01:28] johnfive21: Good ol' Tahmas Kench
[3:01:30] TDotTerror: Top Kench, m8.
[3:01:35] Ribbons_Almark: top kench indeed
[3:01:38] titanodin: prepare for a sleep fest
[3:01:55] kapjak: nassus more like assus
[3:02:01] ashla11: this is the part of the broadcast where they cut to literally any other lane
[3:02:06] Edokdyshi: Time to be super punishing so he can't stack! Good luck with the game
[3:02:19] Orangemorph: Oh gosh against Susan Top..
[3:02:35] ReginaldXIV: I don't watch LoL matches, do they tend to cut away from Nasus?
[3:02:48] ashla11: im not sure lol, was just going with the comments
[3:02:57] Tronix_604: tahm shits on nauseous, he can deny so much stacking by punishing
[3:02:59] freka_man: just get the wave under tower
[3:03:03] Jukettaja: Now that I think about it Darius and Tahm have the same kill condition. Both want stacks on the enemy.
[3:03:13] partick10: go tea 2@
[3:03:13] Tronix_604: nasus *
[3:03:15] freka_man: go river
[3:03:16] ashla11: I do watch LCS sometimes but dont know about nassus
[3:03:17] Orangemorph: Nobody [plays Nasus in LCS/ PRO ELO
[3:03:48] Seejo_Crux: oop, so much for my channel points
[3:03:59] ReginaldXIV: I figured nobody plays Nasus in pro
[3:04:00] titanodin: wait it cancels flash?
[3:04:15] br4nd0nh347: no it follows
[3:04:17] Jukettaja: Cancelled the W dash
[3:04:26] Rawrsong: In competitive play, Nasus either gets crushed or doesn't get the time to become a menace
[3:04:39] ghostsofcarcosa: Second bet up who gets the first tower
[3:04:42] MullyMagic: so when jps guy goes to burrow the enemy ca see it
[3:04:48] Tronix_604: no his fear  from E can cancel tahms tunnel  cast
[3:04:54] br4nd0nh347: warwickq follows his flash  warwick E cancelled his tunnel cast
[3:05:10] Baske_T: ^
[3:05:12] Orangemorph: Strippin should try to  gank top early to try to fuck up Nasus
[3:06:14] Orangemorph: Especially while having comms with the top laner
[3:07:43] yelom: soo... jp scaping to iron?
[3:08:20] EvoCaliber: ijpFLURK
[3:08:23] 14neo: we already won a match, this might be a loss but we're going for Silver ijpNODDERS
[3:08:34] WaxCourant: ganking Nasus is so annoying because he can just wither and walk to tower.
[3:08:39] stoiink: play against a nasus is one of the most boring matchups you can have Sadge
[3:09:11] DCHenkels: Susan is a tough to play against, especially once they start getting more and more stacks.  does Nassus still scale infinitely with the stacks?
[3:09:18] Pulsifur: Hey chat, Other then being a super mom whats Dodger been up to? Legit just haven't heard much mention.
[3:09:32] afreak10: why u ask here
[3:09:36] Darkaros: Hmm She has a Twitch stream and a Twitter if you want to follow her
[3:09:57] 14neo: @Pulsifur she streams pretty much daily, you must've just missed her
[3:10:13] Seejo_Crux: Oh dear

[3:10:49] Dredstryde: xD Thats how people feel when you W away xD

[3:10:53] freka_man: thats a pretty good ww
[3:10:59] Baske_T: @stoiink its not a bug, its part of his skill descrition
[3:10:59] freka_man: I can say he smurfin
[3:11:05] Ebra: riot is just making busted changes to so many heroes
[3:11:23] afreak10: its over
[3:11:25] MrJaycawbz: @stoiink It's been in the game for years, it's definitely known about at this point, so even if it's not intended, they're ok with it.
[3:11:29] zechetto: @stoiink It's a small leap, but if he holds the button, he "attaches" to you for a bit

[3:12:47] Orangemorph: @Archangel3003 Maybe he got a PBE account ?
[3:12:48] Dredstryde: @Archangel3003 They could have been on the the Public Test server - not likely but poassible
[3:13:22] Archangel3003: Wouldn't she have been changed when released on main though?
[3:13:30] ashla11: EU ping?
[3:13:37] freka_man: isnt smite at 900
[3:13:58] Orangemorph: @Archangel3003 It depends but normally in the PBE stage its only small tweaks
[3:14:30] Archangel3003: Well I guess I'll see how it goes when this game finally loads in!

[3:20:47] Fiendmaw: Meatloaf died?!?1

[3:21:40] Fiendmaw: That sucks... RIP
[3:21:48] Darkaros: team* chat rather. Just asked why the team left him to do drag LUL
[3:21:58] EvoCaliber: Big Denny's Energy
[3:22:04] freka_man: could have done baron
[3:22:07] freka_man: since ww dead
[3:22:09] bansheehero: @AinzN Truth is out there!
[3:22:11] WaxCourant: They win this I think. WW is such a useless champ lol.
[3:22:18] KarmaTheQueen: you guys should rush baron, no ww and veigsar
[3:22:23] AinzN: bansheehero always believe in the Kench! ijpH
[3:22:59] wikes60: @PiousFoole in teamfights ww can be big since he can fear the entire team
[3:23:00] bansheehero: yeah dont believe the cover-up. MasterChef is sitll on twitch :D
[3:23:02] Darkaros: baron was a smart call but entire team has to be on the same page
[3:23:04] freka_man: no baron goodl play
[3:23:44] Kymix: mid then vision around drake
[3:23:49] Fiendmaw: Oh veigar is their bot lane carry
[3:24:01] WaxCourant: @wikes60 I'm a WW main and 1s fear costs him his damage reduction. You usually just die for it. His teamfighting is really hard to do well.
[3:24:01] johnfive21: that's baron
[3:24:02] afreak10: deep
[3:24:03] Kymix: rip
[3:24:09] Kymix: that is baron or drake

[3:24:49] Liminaly: nice ult from draven, honestly the ww seems like the biggest problem by far
[3:25:07] Darkaros: some peeps look up WW, he's like 40% W/R in Bronze 3-3 with WW.
[3:25:12] Darkaros: looked*
[3:25:29] Frog_Quest: Pog
[3:25:31] 14neo: the play!

[3:25:50] 14neo: good play but didn't work out PepeHands
[3:25:53] afreak10: baron
[3:26:04] Gathas_Gaming: draven has some weird pathing
[3:26:20] Kymix: if you get zilean ulted, then it is more worth it to die and get revived, you will revive with more health and mana
[3:26:24] Fiendmaw: Their lategame scaling is better than our
[3:26:27] AinzN: POints saved for now? PauseChamp
[3:27:00] Kymix: turn around for baron

[3:27:44] m3rcer: KEKW
[3:27:50] johnfive21: it adds slow and damage over time to your attacks @14neo
[3:28:00] Keyah: You're Draven's a moron, he complained about everybody going dragon earlier as well
[3:28:04] 14neo: @johnfive21 oh nice
[3:28:05] famulor: Stupid question from a dota 2 player but is JP using any "third party software" for this game? anything a lol noob like me should look into?
[3:28:07] ralphfromdk: man, that draven sure has big draven energy
[3:28:13] Darkaros: !app
[3:28:13] itmeBOT: JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[3:28:14] TDotTerror: Canon Draven.
[3:28:15] roflrabbit: Veigar beeing bitesized, but slippery
[3:28:18] ChiZWorkshop: big dravidiot energy

[3:28:28] Invess: trying to solo as draven is just good roleplay

[3:28:31] freka_man: is faster
[3:28:38] Invess: oh wow someone said it first lol
[3:28:40] 14neo: this time Rezzak kinda yeah, the other time he was wrong though
[3:29:08] freka_man: yes
[3:29:11] Rezzak77: well ya tower is dumb compared to that drake
[3:29:25] 14neo: now it's gonna be pretty much about hoping that we're on the same page as Draven to make plays happen
[3:29:57] johnfive21: At times like this I find following the one person making the calls. Even if they're bad calls. If you commit as 5 it usually works out
[3:30:14] roflrabbit: noice

[5:32:12] stringz: q after the slow, it gets negated :D
[5:32:15] StarPogPlatinum: You have to use it after to remove the slow
[5:32:19] KTGoggins: @Puffywiggles If you're winnin', das all you need BloodTrail
[5:32:21] professor_arcane: should have flashed eq
[5:32:31] professor_arcane: usign the Q to cleanse the barrel slow
[5:32:34] KTGoggins: Kench is fine, just not oppressive anymore

[5:34:22] helper800: @Puffywiggles Gotta proxy farm
[5:34:37] KTGoggins: @Puffywiggles When ya do get around to him, #1 tip is just "Be annoying", and don't worry about lane phase :p
[5:34:51] TDotTerror: NANI?
[5:35:12] Puffywiggles: @KTGoggins Yeah that sounds like some good stuff. Cant always guarantee a win, so being annoying at least gives you something
[5:35:38] Lindobu: PauseChamp reconnected
[5:35:56] KTGoggins: Singed is the epitome of "lose lane, win game", his whole goal in teamfights is to be really annoying and decide whether to peel for the carries or pick off an enemy

[7:04:13] Darkaros: COPIUM believers
[7:04:16] Kevo_Fett: @MattyTheBoi same, and it seems the whole reason i stopped plays still applies
[7:04:19] AinzN: I believe in the comeback!
[7:04:34] DerfOnTurf: Such good odds :)
[7:04:35] Invess: @Darkaros surely half the enemy team will go afk right at this moment

[7:05:53] Invess: that is one unbalanced, uninteractive ass card game
[7:05:54] Twizzlar: @keepertj_ i mean lots of new champs, different items, dragons & souls, map changing etc, laning and jungle etc is same
[7:05:56] Darkaros: @keepertj_ herald seems like a nice addition, objective for top/jg. there's some funky dragon buffs and objective bounties to spice up the overall game. I don't watch League but it seems quite different to what I remember 7+ yrs ago

[7:51:16] Darkaros: Just remember you can block her from last hitting cuz her machine gun q is a skill shot technically
[7:51:20] Midnight4life: Did they win that last match chat? I had to step away to clean.
[7:51:25] afreak10: no
[7:51:30] AinzN: mayo_on_rice it's more of his passive when he does something
[7:51:32] Invess: She's Neon, from the iconic Valorant series
[7:51:36] Darkaros: mayo_on_rice no but both Zeri and Zeus have reallll shitty auto attacks for last hitting so they rely on their Q's to last hit
[7:51:42] Midnight4life: damn
[7:51:46] Darkaros: and they're short CD spells that function as autos
[7:51:53] Kalamtas: did they win the amumu game?
