[2:58:50] LmaoLp: @kukka30 not sure, i think he actually was wanting to remain with RA (?)
[2:58:53] kukka30: @ouatssss yeah maybe. i think he was afraid of FPX's new roster trainwreck
[2:59:07] kukka30: @LmaoLp ahh i see

[2:59:27] kukka30: Gori has been underwhelming so far right?
[2:59:40] Aenerius: If there's anything that will collapse during the spring split, it's either FPX or maybe OMG me thinks
[2:59:54] ouatssss: @kukka30 who would think the new fpx can be this good, right? PogChamp
[2:59:59] MarxistTurtle: current meta is good for Gori
[3:00:20] MarxistTurtle: even if Gori dies on lane he will be still a threat cuz of corki viktor meta
[3:00:22] kukka30: @ouatssss yes i didnt expect them to be this good
[3:00:24] LmaoLp: JDG have Hope Pog
[3:00:32] MarxistTurtle: but once meta changes I'd look for replacement
[3:00:42] Aenerius: FPX definitely performing better than originally expected!
[3:00:44] kukka30: @DarthLaser idk why but i feel it would be omg to collapse first
[3:01:01] kukka30: @MarxistTurtle is gori even playing good atm?
[3:01:13] Aenerius: @kukka30 Early wins versus easy teams raises mental only to crush it afterwards so yeah possibly
[3:01:14] lolwigglecat: FPX easy top 4 rn gonna get even better with Clid
[3:01:22] lummyboytellem: @MarxistTurtle gori is good enough. just give him time
[3:01:30] ouatssss: @MarxistTurtle yeah, 13 million rmb
[3:01:35] MarxistTurtle: @kukka30 he dies on lane then tops damage chart cuz he is on corki duty
[3:01:37] BigMightyena: Orange Kappa
[3:01:57] kukka30: @MarxistTurtle i see
[3:02:14] lolwigglecat: Gori got player of the split in his rookie split for LCK for a reason, hes just adjusting back to LPL
[3:02:14] Aenerius: I mean, Beichuan is performing so not even sure they need Clid right now. I'd rather see a replacement top
[3:02:18] Sylvanas_Windrunner1: Hang is basically hyllisang, but without the good side KEKW

[3:04:11] LmaoLp: @MarxistTurtle hang gets it done with fewer letters in his name. GIGACHAD

[3:04:43] originalcastelino: Is it best of 3
[3:04:55] kukka30: @originalcastelino yes
[3:05:00] Aenerius: @LmaoLp Hmm could be because JDG was seen as a superteam and imploded
[3:05:06] kukka30: all group stage games are bo3
[3:05:08] lolwigglecat: Clid and Gori will be the best mid jg duo in LPL
[3:05:19] shkim3680: LNG 2-0 ?
[3:05:26] Aenerius: Reason why I enjoy LPL and LCK way more these days compared to LEC: Bo3
[3:05:32] jovsu: is there LPL playlist?
[3:05:40] ultranovel: yeah shkim 2 0
[3:05:41] Aenerius: @lolChaser1 Bold take but I like it
[3:05:45] kukka30: @DarthLaser exactly
[3:05:51] ouatssss: @LmaoLp after what Griffin treated him? I think he's just unhappy with the current jdg roaster
[3:06:03] kukka30: @DarthLaser bo1 feel coinflippy
[3:06:29] Aenerius: Bo1 offers less narrative, less character development for players, less to cheer for your team
[3:06:29] LmaoLp: @ouatssss fair, but i think its more homesickness sort of thing yknow
[3:06:36] ouatssss: let's go, 369 time

[3:07:12] MarxistTurtle: honestly kanavi just fell off I doubt he is gonna become good if he returns to lck

[3:07:56] MazelCasts: You know what, I like it with the e first anyways LOL
[3:07:59] Aenerius: Bo3 involves more mental and also trains coaches to adapt to a game, and mental for players
[3:08:05] kukka30: @DarthLaser yeah, i would like to see how they adapt drafts after 1 lose and how they try to change their plan
[3:08:07] ouatssss: @MarxistTurtle he's not adjusting good to current meta, previously 2 years was like jg core, but now the core moved back to mid and adc
[3:08:09] snax985: hyli hang
[3:08:12] lummyboytellem: @pchen20 they arnt playing well at all. great individuals tho. but even the individual performance is lacking rn
[3:08:18] kukka30: @DarthLaser bo3 and bo5 are easily more interesting
[3:08:58] Aenerius: Yagao isn't performing well but it might have to do with the departure of Loken and Lvmao. I fear there is a lack of vision and shotcalling in the team and with a Kanavi who seems down, it could be it falls on Yagao now
[3:09:57] ultranovel: 369 what a handsome dont care about products  GIGACHAD
[3:10:21] lummyboytellem: @DarthLaser that coould be true. id love to know the behind the scenes dynamic.
