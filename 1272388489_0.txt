[2:23:58] bansheehero: @Stabaccus I meant dying with 5k or 5 gold.
[2:24:01] CamberCYM: @Gat0rCh0mp no i think he pinged pyke
[2:24:08] Tronix_604: @kalamtas some items are to OP together so it's one or the other for better build diversity
[2:24:19] Darkaros: nah it says in chat that pyke question mark pinged jp
[2:24:20] Kaias84: that garen skin is pretty cool
[2:24:28] Stabaccus: @bansheehero Yeah I meant thats the only effect on kill gold positively. Dying lots without kills/assists lowers your kill gold worth too

[3:20:16] Riluske: @Gameofpwns16 I guess that's what I don't understand. If he was matched with them, doesn't that mean they are in a similar league? So the skill level should be similar
[3:20:23] Eyeofthehawks: Mumu kat is a god tier combo

[3:21:29] mrkenndy: so sam didnt carry hard enough lol j/k
[3:21:38] Gameofpwns16: @Riluske Matchmaking isn't perfect, so they weight the LP gains in favor of the underdogs. Also, if you think about it, if you're ranked higher than your opponents and you lose, then they should take a lot of LP and you should lose a lot of LP.
[3:21:44] Darkaros: JP thinks they're gonna win, but are they getting first blood? Predict now OOOO
[3:21:47] Eyeofthehawks: If youre against jinx you just kill her when you choose

[3:48:30] prrrah123: Their mid and jug is playing decent too bad the rest is LUL
[3:48:33] Darkaros: !app
[3:48:33] itmeBOT: JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[3:49:00] Mauldidnothingwrong: @Darkaros Thank you! cohh7

[3:53:27] FrozanFlames: ijpCHAIR
[3:53:46] bansheehero: When you are this ahead on gold, is  there like unlimited teleport script or something like that?
[3:54:03] bansheehero: Or is it that you have no towers to port to?
[3:54:07] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[3:54:08] snyft: Silver yet?
[3:54:16] Darkaros: nope
[3:54:22] snyft: Close?
[3:54:24] bansheehero: Kind of felt weird watching JP running so long to join the team
[3:54:37] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1484954023023329283
[3:54:45] AinzN: snyft Bronze 1 with about 50odd LP
[3:54:51] bansheehero: So I was wondering if that is normal or just no cares given
[3:55:00] Eyeofthehawks: @bansheehero No, you have to choose teleport as a summoner spell before the game starts
[3:55:04] Eyeofthehawks: Theres no other way to teleport
[3:55:28] bansheehero: oh that makes sense I knew there was a teleport but nothing mroe :D
[3:55:28] Eyeofthehawks: You cant b uy TPs like in Dota
[3:56:00] CamberCYM: Are they still called summoner spells if they retconned summoners out of the lore?
[3:56:27] Darkaros: most non-dota moobas have a Recall feature/button, and then LoL has Teleport as a go-anywhere-ish port
[3:56:44] Darkaros: it still says things like "a summoner has disconnected" MmmHmm
[3:56:51] bansheehero: yeah but dota has tp, heroes have mounts
[3:56:57] Eyeofthehawks: Doesnt Sona still say summoner as well?
[3:57:12] bansheehero: so I was epxecting something like that, not knowing you have to choose it at start
[3:57:15] Eyeofthehawks: old lore was whacky
[3:57:23] ワフルデラ: Strippin was so blissfully ignorant about the TFT stuff
[3:57:36] Eyeofthehawks: There is a way to change your ss in-game, but you have to take a certain keystone mastery
[3:57:38] ワフルデラ: and now he knows about the shitty monetization on the new arena NotLikeThis
[3:57:38] Darkaros: !makemulti itmejp strippin
[3:57:38] itmeBOT: MultiTwitch Links updated.
[3:57:42] Darkaros: !multi
[3:57:42] itmeBOT: MULTI STREAM LINK: https://multistre.am/itmejp/strippin/
[3:58:26] 0GHammer: tft mtx is insane
[3:58:33] Eyeofthehawks: at least its all cosmetic
[3:58:38] bansheehero: I starting to understand why it is so hard to carry the team in League compared to dota or heroes
[3:58:41] Eyeofthehawks: idc how crazy it is if its cosmetic only
[3:58:43] 0GHammer: true but it's so overpriced
[3:59:10] ワフルデラ: it's 100€ just to get the arena
[3:59:12] Eyeofthehawks: its priced to maximize profit
[3:59:14] Darkaros: stripSuffer 5 more hours of League boys
[3:59:20] AinzN: We get a long stream again?
[3:59:21] Victo0: @bansheehero the game was heavielly balanced so that you can't, it's balanced toward pro play and tries to force you to play as a team and limit solo carry
[3:59:27] Gabriev666: no queue, only gamba hypeE
[3:59:43] Eyeofthehawks: League is an odd game in the sense that its patches and game design evolved to enforce what was the meta
[3:59:56] Eyeofthehawks: There was a time where "Ad Carry" wasnt a thing in League
[3:59:59] Eyeofthehawks: and it was just the wild west
[4:00:03] Darkaros: did you try running as admin someoen suggested that
[4:00:16] Ikkarrow: Teemo I dare you
[4:00:18] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!

[4:01:43] ReginaldXIV: Poppy vs Mordekaiser is fun
[4:01:51] Ikkarrow: you need to own the champ to use them in rank

[4:01:51] RoboticBiotic777: soon JP will win world's for NA. ijpHAPPY
[4:02:04] Ikkarrow: but Yi costs nothing to get for free
[4:02:15] KerwinBJones: Master Yi is also a cheap as shit champ, not hard for any new account to get
[4:02:18] Eyeofthehawks: Isnt yi a 450 essence champ?
[4:02:23] snyft: Vex usually top
[4:02:37] Eyeofthehawks: NODDERS
[4:02:37] Gregle: that's what they say
[4:02:38] ReginaldXIV: I feel like Yi, Vayne, and Yone are staple bronze bans
[4:02:41] RoboticBiotic777: I thought Vex was a jungle for some reason. lol
[4:02:43] 0GHammer: zeri is disgusting
[4:02:51] 0GHammer: uncapped movement speed
[4:02:52] Eyeofthehawks: Blitz used to be a bronze ban 100%

[4:12:24] AinzN: Hopefully someone corrects me
[4:12:30] genoerig: no banishment right?
[4:12:45] bansheehero: Somebody said 10-5 in chat, but thats about as good of a guess as yours
[4:12:51] AnorienNightwish: I only get to see the first few hours of the stream ijpSAD , since I started working couple weeks back
[4:13:06] AinzN: bansheehero that might be more correct I know it was 10-something

[4:16:49] Felgrun: If he hits you while the big one is sucking on you it deals %hp damage I think
[4:16:50] RavenHS: it drains health and makes zombies
[4:16:53] AinzN: Does that big minion de-spawn after a mount of time?
[4:16:57] kingmac_i: Yorick's ultimate does dmg to you, and increases his dmg to you as well

[4:33:21] Eyeofthehawks: if kindred gets activated, damn shes oppressive

[4:33:43] TheXtractor: Great to see JP playing with sam. Hows today going?
[4:33:46] Eyeofthehawks: Kindred without stacks is damn near useless
[4:33:47] asj1410: full ap team
[4:34:02] ReginaldXIV: Yeah that's why Kindred is hard
[4:34:12] ReginaldXIV: She requires good laners
[4:34:13] AinzN: TheXtractor 4-1 I think
[4:34:16] ReginaldXIV: At least 2 of the lanes
[4:34:24] TheXtractor: @AinzN cohhPog
[4:34:46] Eyeofthehawks: In bronze tho you can easily bait people into bad fight sbecause people tunnel on the marks
[4:34:54] ワフルデラ: ziggs can 25-0 a turret with an ability too KEKW
[4:34:59] ReginaldXIV: That's true
[4:35:01] Koinman25: ziggs mid is a thing
[4:35:05] ReginaldXIV: If the lane is stable anyway
[4:35:08] m3leed: ZIGG ZAC
[4:35:12] asj1410: Lux is support cuz she banned blitz
[4:35:13] Kyuukotsu: Ziggs was originally a mid before becoming APC.
[4:35:18] ReginaldXIV: Back in the olden days, Ziggs went mid
[4:35:24] TheXtractor: A I love that garen skin it looks amazing
[4:35:33] Eyeofthehawks: Tbf back in the day brand went mid too
[4:35:35] Eyeofthehawks: now hes support
[4:36:00] Fairlight_Excalibur: GOD KING BATTLE
[4:36:14] ワフルデラ: anything with cc can be played as support tbf if you're good enough
[4:36:33] Eyeofthehawks: Yeah but i never see brand mid anymore because no mobility
[4:36:41] Fairlight_Excalibur: hey hey. Been watching your bronzekov campaign the past few days.
[4:36:56] TickleTheCohh: rooD Fairlight is among us.
[4:36:59] Eyeofthehawks: Mid SHOULD be a farm fest with little interaction
[4:37:04] Eyeofthehawks: but its bronze
[4:37:10] Tideshaper: @Fairlight_Excalibur been loving your league streams, huge lurker, Teemo should've taken the deal
[4:37:19] Fairlight_Excalibur: not sure how backseaty I can be in here and get away with it, but
[4:37:26] Eyeofthehawks: Pretty much none
[4:37:36] Fairlight_Excalibur: you can beat darius if the fight starts when you are both around half HP. Fighting from full hp you just lose.
[4:37:45] TheXtractor: battle of the skins
[4:37:53] Fairlight_Excalibur: @Tideshaper yes, he should have LUL
[4:37:54] drunkencpt: yes

[4:38:07] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[4:38:09] Joitch: If he doesnt hit the q it could be close
[4:38:13] Eyeofthehawks: Extended fights with darius are a bad time
[4:38:14] Kaddhy_2k10: @TheXtractor of Gods
[4:38:14] Darkaros: Just don't point out absolute basics and you're probably fine MmmHmm JP will (strongly) say if it ever gets too much with backseating
[4:38:21] DonSombrero: lvl 6 execution battle
[4:38:32] Fairlight_Excalibur: @itmeJP You can beat him as early as level 4 but you have to avoid an all in, need to do short trades to get both your HP down to half.
[4:38:36] drunkencpt: if you dodge the outer ring of his axe aoe you can win, but needs some decent reaction
[4:38:44] AinzN: It's not Dunk Master Darius so you should be fine ijpSIP
[4:38:45] Darkaros: JP played a Darius vs Garen matchup, him Darius, yesterday so I'm sure he has someeee idea of how to paly it
[4:38:49] Joitch: The wave is in a good spot for you tho
[4:38:51] TheXtractor: The two-handed spin animation is so cool demn
[4:38:53] Eyeofthehawks: with equal movespeed it also requires darius to not be paying attention lol

[4:41:09] SkylerKK: Are you having more fun duoing?
[4:41:11] Fairlight_Excalibur: you're in a good spot to kill him
[4:41:15] Fairlight_Excalibur: he has low mana
[4:41:28] Eyeofthehawks: thats the kind of backseating that doesnt fly well Fairlight
[4:41:31] Eyeofthehawks: since oyu asked earlier
[4:41:34] AinzN: skylerkk I would say yes

[4:42:29] Sakkyoku: Is JP using a plugin to see the camp timers?
[4:42:35] Eyeofthehawks: yep
[4:42:35] AinzN: !app Sakkyoku
[4:42:35] itmeBOT: @Sakkyoku JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[4:42:35] Baske_T: !app @Sakkyoku
[4:42:41] Fairlight_Excalibur: @14neo nah I'm trash, but Garen and Darius are my most played champs so I've done both sides of this matchup 50 times
[4:42:43] Darkaros: Stream + reading chat delay makes it pretty difficult so I usually just warn people that their backseating's a bit too reaction-based MmmHmm
[4:43:01] Sakkyoku: @AinzN Riot is ok with that plugin?
[4:43:02] 14neo: @14neo ah, i see stripNote
[4:43:06] TheXtractor: cohhFee i have ptsd already
[4:43:12] ReginaldXIV: I like Darius, but I don't understand all of his matchups yet
[4:43:12] TheXtractor: cohhL
[4:43:24] AinzN: Sakkyoku there are a few apps that do this so I think so?
[4:43:27] Rikh: in a vacuum darius hardshits on garen
[4:43:48] Baske_T: Riot even links u.gg and op.gg from their website
[4:43:56] ReginaldXIV: why'd he ignite? lol

[4:55:58] Kaias84: @Baske_T at 100 you get into promo games, and it's best of 5
[4:55:59] Gathas_Gaming: @itmeJP and you get a free win for promo
[4:56:01] AinzN: 5-1 I think Darkaros
[4:56:02] ThatWazGuy: now that he's said it, jp won't bee lucky rooSuffer
[4:56:05] ReginaldXIV: stripProud
[4:56:13] ShrowdArrow: let's go! let's get out of bronze hell
[4:56:19] ReginaldXIV: Trust stripProud
[4:56:22] psychic_ward: should I be worried that it looks like JP is having fun in League?  Like isn't that one of the 4 signs of the apocolypse? ijpAHH ijpCRY
[4:56:35] AinzN: The power of friendship is so strong!
[4:56:37] IkomaTomoya: Winning IS fun NODDERS
[4:56:45] Darkaros: 4 game hot streak so we are 4-1
[4:56:57] SoulEroder: @psychic_ward that 4 signs had already come to pass, this is the outcome
[4:57:07] drunkencpt: Garen is a really good climber. Easy to understand and pretty strong
[4:57:08] AinzN: Nah can't be 4-1 can it?
[4:57:48] TheXtractor: Duoing is very good cuz its more fun, easier wins and you learn more. better than suffering solo lul
[4:57:53] fraggleroctv: does Riste still play Garen in mid or top?
[4:58:17] azuae: duo is definitely the way to make it out of bronze / silver elo hell
[4:58:27] ThatWazGuy: pretty sure most tools think every bronze/silver adc is a bad CS-er LUL
[4:58:32] AinzN: !Pool BamBoooh
[4:58:32] itmeBOT: @BamBoooh JP actively plays a lot of: Tahm Kench, Kayle, Mundo, Garen, Trist, MF; has played a bit but doesn't currently like: Teemo, Irelia, Darius, Ashe, Xayah
[4:58:36] AKraftyBasterd: Amumu bis
[4:58:37] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:58:38] Darkaros: Darius is kinda bruisery
[4:58:38] ChiZWorkshop: true
[4:58:57] Highspring: Is that a TF adc?
[4:58:59] Gathas_Gaming: that actually works until master :D
[4:59:02] gobbothegreen: But it is definetly less fun to not play other characters
[4:59:04] AinzN: I liked on Strippin's app it says JP is a passive laner peepoGiggles
[4:59:06] ThatWazGuy: in lower ELO playing your 1 trick is better than doing any kind of counter picking
[4:59:07] sunflower204: usually when they pick malph into garen they are just planning to lay back and wait for team fights.
[4:59:09] shatteredsaint: ad fate? havent seen that in years
[4:59:22] Kaias84: @AinzN wait what ?
[4:59:26] prrrah123: To is that line up
[4:59:29] prrrah123: Tf
[4:59:30] bulletsponge55: funny how much better you've been doing with just one competent teammate lol
[4:59:31] Kaias84: clearly isn'taccurate then xD
[4:59:35] Vendiktuss: ye caus malph cant really kill alone so he is mostly for team fights
[4:59:39] Gathas_Gaming: ad TF wow that is like 2012?
[4:59:54] AinzN: Kaias84 I know right! JP always goes ham!
[4:59:54] Miros__: TF in general is dogshit
[4:59:54] prrrah123: Easy win LUL
[5:00:01] shatteredsaint: yeah ad tf was a thing in 2011
[5:00:03] ThatWazGuy: oh he is AD with those runes, isn't he
[5:00:04] sunflower204: Malph can get completely shit on and still swing fights with good ults
[5:00:07] Irvatar: Can be AP TF in bot, but wit hhis cc and pyke it can be huge in bottom
[5:00:12] gobbothegreen: might just be apc tf
[5:00:13] DemonSamurai: Murc treads game if i ever saw one
[5:00:19] ThatWazGuy: nah, that tf has lethal tempo, he's ad LUL
[5:00:24] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[5:00:28] afreak10: veigar got buffed?
[5:00:36] psychic_ward: Unfortunately it looks like Darius didn't make the NBA.  Garen is too strong as a God King.
[5:00:46] ritchie313: he's so fun but very squish
[5:00:49] Victo0: @itmeJP best current winrate in silver+ is amumu
[5:00:52] ThatWazGuy: I played karthus jungle and got absolutely bullied by a xin zhao
[5:01:00] sunflower204: landing Karth's q takes some practice though
[5:01:05] Gathas_Gaming: is karthus kit the same as 10 years ago?
[5:01:06] gobbothegreen: I think its seraphine bot right? she is amazing apc
[5:01:08] afreak10: veigar a walking nuke if u get farm , but need to be good with the stun
[5:01:39] AinzN: I still think the best thing about League is the speedy start you get when the game starts
[5:01:43] AinzN: You don't get that in Dota
[5:01:48] AinzN: And I feel they are missing out

[6:00:05] bansheehero: You know how people always say that League has surrender? I think its because nobody is using it :D
[6:00:08] Felgrun: top lane bruh
[6:00:09] Dredstryde: top has minions and no tower...
[6:00:19] Rdei: 4k gold
[6:00:21] Darkaros: surely backdoor protection is stronger than an underleveled teemo?
[6:00:28] Darkaros: or does it only exist for towers?
[6:00:30] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour.

[6:05:18] EvoCaliber: !app @Psomaster
[6:05:18] itmeBOT: JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[6:05:19] Dredstryde: >_> got dragon soul - just gotta 5man and zombie  man yeah?

[6:06:53] Brytice: @AinzN There are 3 different 500g pots, that give you some short buffs, they're only useful for lategame when you have 6 items
[6:07:02] Darkaros: Teemo didn't buy enough time
[6:07:02] Wholemane: no reason to ult there @itmeJP

[6:11:58] TwitchHoodChat: @itmeJP how do you like the steak cooked
[6:12:13] sunflower204: teemo is more of an annoyance than a counter
[6:12:20] AinzN: @14neo go big or go home but since I am already home got to go big! ijpNODDERS
[6:12:32] 14neo: playing Teemo? i'd rather he play Amumu - maybe he mispoke?
[6:12:41] Snowplex: probably Camille jg?

[6:15:14] Papapwnage: all boomer rappers + kendrick lol
[6:15:16] SamMFJackson: who tf is kendrick lamar? sounds like he plays for the knicks
[6:15:17] bansheehero: That songs boomertastic :D

[6:15:59] Lucien_NM: it is when you put the donger in the arse
[6:16:03] Skyform: pretty sure i saw Showgirls at 13 years old
[6:16:10] SamMFJackson: oh god, that song was complete dogshit
[6:16:14] Atorxke: All in baby
[6:16:27] abrady: @Skyform same
[6:16:34] 14neo: @AinzN you will be soon stripFufu
[6:16:37] ghostsofcarcosa: Be bold bet big lose or win throw in all your gold
[6:16:41] kapjak: obama's xbox? is that the persons name
[6:16:41] Felgrun: Isn't samira pretty bad nowadays?
[6:17:17] Papapwnage: Im glad JP is still enjoying himself playing league. I have been playing Tarkov and am about to quit. Tired of getting 1 tapped
[6:17:51] Psomaster: @Papapwnage You should see how many times my buddy keeps getting killed with t4 helmets and t5 armor XD
[6:17:52] Convectt: Tarkov can be rough
[6:18:06] Papapwnage: @Psomaster im using them too, why bother!?!
[6:18:35] Papapwnage: @Psomaster i spawned into factory right at my quest to fix stuiff with tools. died in LITERAL 6 seconds
[6:18:39] Psomaster: @Papapwnage I run t4 helmet and t4 vest, cheapo ones, because it either saves you, or you die no matter what so why waste money
[6:18:43] Convectt: I just defaulted to Altyns to avoid that you don't see anything if you are dead anyways
[6:19:03] AinzN: @14neo better get the blankies ready! ijpCOMFY
[6:19:04] 14neo: a decent Camille finally? ijpMONKA
[6:19:12] Papapwnage: @Psomaster this is my first wipe, i got to lvl 14 im happy i guess
[6:19:16] Convectt: this was a good while ago tho
[6:19:22] 14neo: for sure ijpCOMFY
[6:19:27] Convectt: so don't know if it is still as busted as back then
[6:19:49] Atorxke: EZ
[6:19:49] Psomaster: @Papapwnage my like 6th wipe, I stopped early due to being sick, got to 26 this time, my record is 40 I think
[6:19:56] ShadowsparksTV: @papapwnage 15 is when you get access to the flea market. It helps a bit.
[6:20:07] afreak10: much better than the last one
[6:20:15] Darkaros: MmmHmm First Blood was lost, but who's gonna get the first tower? Predict now
[6:20:20] 14neo: chat i have a bad feeling about this game ijpSAD
[6:20:25] Papapwnage: @ShadowsparksTV i could see that, being able to buy stuff to upgrade the base
[6:20:26] Atorxke: All in again baby
[6:20:42] bansheehero: @14neo Debbie?
[6:20:48] ghostsofcarcosa: @14neo Just means the victory will feel better COPIUM
[6:20:51] ShadowsparksTV: @papapwnage It can make scav runs a lot more lucrative too.
[6:21:00] Convectt: @Papapwnage Opens up guns a lot aswell since you can buy parts
[6:21:04] AinzN: ijpONO
[6:21:05] TheXtractor: cohh7
[6:21:07] TDotTerror: First permaban of the day.
[6:21:12] Felgrun: Her shield came back at the perfect time rip
[6:21:15] BDave: rip
[6:21:17] afreak10: ijp7
[6:21:19] SkylerKK: Have the games been going well chat?
[6:21:21] 14neo: @ghostsofcarcosa indeed COPIUM
[6:21:22] Papapwnage: That sounds fun, maybe ill keep grinding then boys
[6:21:33] aethybryr: keep yer cool you got this jp
[6:21:35] AinzN: Chat you were all behaving so well today! I'm proud of you! ijpLOVE
[6:21:36] Twizzlar: @skylerkk yea, think he's in him promo's to silver right now
[6:21:37] ghostsofcarcosa: For the most part yea @skylerkk
[6:21:40] sorarecot: musicaDANCE
[6:21:41] Toojicle: Unlucky was all! Good shit
[6:21:44] Psomaster: @Papapwnage Get the flea at 15, make good guns, try some stuff out at the least
[6:21:49] StarPogPlatinum: There's the advice tag, maybe that's because of it monkaHmm
[6:22:08] Felgrun: People dont even read titles you think they are gonna read tags
[6:22:09] Convectt: building and trying out guns is my favorite thing in Tarkov tbh
[6:22:15] Ikkarrow: earlier when JP asked what Yoricks ghoul did and I gave a brief description was that okay?
[6:22:18] 14neo: @14neo are you talking about the 'Debbie Downer' phenomenon or something else? :O
[6:22:18] StarPogPlatinum: True LUL
[6:22:19] Papapwnage: bullets seem to matter more than the gun
[6:22:21] AinzN: StarPogPlatinum there is a difference though if your first message is some basic knowledge and that
[6:22:37] AinzN: Ikkarrow that was fine as JP wanted the knowledge
[6:22:38] Atorxke: sadge long legs miss clicked LUL
[6:22:41] OdinX1: Stuns are OP
[6:22:51] SamMFJackson: garen ulti is satisfying as fuucckk! ijpDOGSLIDE
[6:22:57] Darkaros: Backseating is allowed, with the caveat that it's not basic knowledge. That was a good example of not being helpful MmmHmm
[6:22:59] ghostsofcarcosa: @Ikkarrow Probably mostly what isn't cool is being disrespectful/dismissive etc
[6:23:03] Psomaster: @Papapwnage Type of bullet vs type of gun. I run 7.62 with an sks or shotty with slugs and they own if your good at your gun types
[6:23:04] bansheehero: Also you need to do X is not an advice, its coaching
[6:23:07] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[6:23:15] bansheehero: people mix that all the time
[6:23:17] Papapwnage: @itmeJP has anyone from chat offered to help you 1v1 learn matchups up top?
[6:23:18] serverfirst300003: warding and recalling is a no no since ward lasts only 60sec
[6:23:30] AinzN: Papapwnage a few have but he doesn't want it
[6:23:34] ShadowsparksTV: @darkaros Because that's not confusing at all.
[6:23:38] Twizzlar: lol wow
[6:23:38] StarPogPlatinum: OOOO
[6:23:39] KDogg241: POGGERS
[6:23:41] Darkaros: Like a while ago someone asked if JP's lane opponent went Ignite or Teleport and that was a useful question to keep in mind. Or reminding JP to buy wards since he explictly asks for it
[6:23:42] AinzN: It's better to learn by playing with friends and having fun
[6:23:46] Papapwnage: @AinzN i respect that
[6:23:46] Koinman25: he didn't pick it up
[6:23:57] Koinman25: nvm
[6:23:58] CamberCYM: LUL???
[6:23:58] Twizzlar: veigar said; my RIFT
[6:24:16] shemg: can't believe he got that lol
[6:24:17] Darkaros: ShadowsparksTV If you're not sure, just don't do it MmmHmm
[6:24:17] OdinX1: Correct
[6:24:19] Fynagle: Props to Veigar for scuttling in there to get it.
[6:24:19] xmlgprorpx: you need kill and pick the thing
[6:24:37] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1484954023023329283
[6:24:44] AinzN: Back to some chill Jammies
[6:24:51] ghostsofcarcosa: Jammies
[6:25:06] StarPogPlatinum: Otherwise it'll be like Diablo 2 when everyone were clicking on the ground to get the loot LUL
[6:25:16] AinzN: Chat what does Namumu's Ult do?
[6:25:24] Papapwnage: @Psomaster i ended up playing Subnatutica after i raged at Tarkov today
[6:25:40] AinzN: StarPogPlatinum like in Dota 2 where when you kill the big boss you can deny his loot ijpNODDERS
[6:25:42] serverfirst300003: @AinzN its Amumu and it stuns everyione around u
[6:26:01] StarPogPlatinum: Amumu ult ? It's an aoe cc around him
[6:26:03] Papapwnage: If she locks lane roam and get kills imo
[6:26:04] epicshoo: Amumu does a kinda big aoe snare around him
[6:26:08] lostinpoe: New Zealand going into alert level red  at midnight tonight
[6:26:08] CamberCYM: its like a very small ravage AinzN
[6:26:09] AinzN: serverfirst300003 yeah that's what I meant and thanks bud! ijpLOVE
[6:26:12] Karamor: camille should win duels against garen, sadly. pretty busted Q she has
[6:26:24] Fynagle: Is amumu ult still a straight stun? I have seen a lot of AoE stun ults now reverted to rooting instead
[6:26:26] AinzN: lostinpoe what for?
[6:26:30] abrady: @itmeJP what addon do you use for LOL
[6:26:30] Convectt: is that orange shield different from a regular shield chat?
[6:26:35] Darkaros: !app
[6:26:35] itmeBOT: JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[6:26:42] AinzN: CamberCYM ok that's a good comparison thanks!
[6:26:46] lostinpoe: covid Omni- whatever it is
[6:26:50] abrady: thanks @Darkaros
[6:26:53] Twizzlar: @Convectt orange shield means it blocks physical, purple blocks magic
[6:27:00] ShadowsparksTV: @convectt It's an adaptable shield. Orange is physical and purpose is magical.
[6:27:02] Wholemane: Creep score?...
[6:27:03] AinzN: lostinpoe hope it goes well bud!
[6:27:03] Papapwnage: yes orange blocks psy and purple magic as twizz said
[6:27:04] xmlgprorpx: your like 40farm xp behind
[6:27:19] afreak10: F
[6:27:26] CipansR_Ayaya: KEKW
[6:27:29] Densetsu_: I think she got away. :)
[6:27:30] AinzN: Damn!
[6:27:32] Densetsu_: Kappa
[6:27:36] Convectt: @Twizzlar @ShadowsparksTV Thanks you 2
[6:27:37] serverfirst300003: @Fynagle its a stun amumu has most stun abilities in the game, he has 2 stacks on his bandage that both stuns and his ult is aoe stun
[6:27:38] hlibbi: v
[6:27:38] Atorxke: you went away from lane while she/he kept farming minions
[6:27:39] lostinpoe: @AinzN Thanks man, I can only hope. Essential worker here.
[6:27:40] SpoonIsTooBig: oh the misery
[6:27:47] Pyr0_______: go get boots

[6:27:55] aethybryr: its all good man it's alllllllllll gooooooooooooood
[6:28:11] ReginaldXIV: Is it time? Is it hullbreaker time? PauseChamp
[6:28:16] lostinpoe: @AinzN Aww :) thank you
[6:28:20] Fynagle: @serverfirst300003 I know Varus's ult used to stun but when I recently played it says root now, so I didn't know.
[6:28:37] Karamor: hullbreaker really doesn't do much against camille
[6:28:44] serverfirst300003: @Fynagle no Varus ult was always a root
[6:28:46] afreak10: wow shes fast
[6:28:51] AinzN: lostinpoe it will be all fixed by next week as NZ is good about all this stuff
[6:28:56] epicshoo: oh amumu's ult used to just snare, glad they changed it. it was balls when i ulted and janna would just ult everyone to safely
[6:29:00] 0GHammer: I hate camille
[6:29:07] Atorxke: @afreak10 long legs
[6:29:19] StarPogPlatinum: She's decent for your elo
[6:29:35] lostinpoe: @AinzN I hope so, i really do.
[6:29:39] Karamor: @epicshoo snare that kept you from attacking, spaghetti code par excellence
[6:29:45] Fynagle: @serverfirst300003 I remember it was a stun way back during his release, but I feel like I see previous stuns are now roots.
[6:29:49] SpoonIsTooBig: this player is just really good
[6:29:51] novorus92: 4.89% ban rate in high elo
[6:29:53] Twizzlar: she also scales really well too
[6:29:56] Pyr0_______: if you Q then ulted she would of died
[6:29:57] Flashx2: LUL
[6:29:59] aethybryr: those legs are t i t i l l a t i n g tho
[6:30:00] Wholemane: you could've had her
[6:30:01] AinzN: Holy shit!
[6:30:07] lostinpoe: @AinzN But thank you for the support much apppreciated!
[6:30:07] Karamor: camille wins duels especially against garen
[6:30:09] Lucien_NM: Camille Broken Top Lane since shit ton of patches
[6:30:11] Papapwnage: auto-q-auto-q
[6:30:18] Invess: fighting game character
[6:30:22] TheXtractor: Camille is a very anti-fun champion to play against
[6:30:32] paradigmshitf: bot tower is gone right? where's the payout
[6:30:44] Papapwnage: true dmg makes the champ tho
[6:30:49] Atorxke: yup yup payout
[6:30:49] xmlgprorpx: no t hey dont know what to do after 5 nerfs they nerf everything EXPEXT the true dmg KEKW
[6:30:52] Darkaros: yehp it is
[6:30:52] Convectt: the shield seems very strong
[6:31:01] Atorxke: EZ
[6:31:04] ReginaldXIV: Clap
[6:31:06] paradigmshitf: ty darkaros
[6:31:14] Twizzlar: her whole kit is strong
[6:31:15] Darkaros: Time for the W/L prediction MmmHmm still a fairly even game despite the difficulty top
[6:31:18] epicshoo: people want their points OMEGALUL
[6:31:25] novorus92: no prio leave drag
[6:31:31] serverfirst300003: @Fynagle i just checked all tha ptach notes for varus on fandom i dont see it being stun
[6:31:36] AinzN: lostinpoe I'm a high risk for Covid stuff so I do my part by not going outside and avoiding everyone ijpKEK
[6:31:57] Karamor: camille overall is pretty balanced, she's her kit is jsut a bitch to play against
[6:32:06] Papapwnage: @AinzN good on you, you have to protect yourself. God knows most Americans only care about themselves
[6:32:13] novorus92: whats the question about varus?
[6:32:38] afreak10: very nice
[6:32:44] epicshoo: red buff slow was HUGE POGGERS
[6:32:46] AinzN: Clap
[6:32:49] get_bent009: D:
[6:32:51] Munetani_NJimha: D:
[6:32:53] CipansR_Ayaya: D: omg
[6:33:04] serverfirst300003: @Fynagle his earliest patch note says its immobolize already so it couldnt be a stun after that
[6:33:08] AinzN: Papapwnage I'm Scottish so it's easy ijpSIP
[6:33:09] Twizzlar: hextech soul is pretty annoying
[6:33:20] novorus92: hextech was nerfed
[6:33:27] Papapwnage: @AinzN nice, wonderful place. I'd love to see it someday
[6:33:39] AinzN: Papapwnage wait till we get independence
[6:33:57] Papapwnage: @AinzN is that a joke i dont get?
[6:34:02] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN Been to the lake district in North England almost made it up to Scotland, but restrictions and all. Someday hopefully.
[6:34:22] 14neo: 'fess up fellas ijpNO
[6:34:28] novorus92: tower for top thats why
[6:34:29] afreak10: ijp7
[6:34:35] Atorxke: Very Sus
[6:34:36] Convectt: people do like to snipe ppl during placements probably
[6:34:37] xmlgprorpx: kinda sus monkaHmm
[6:34:37] Jerbsinator: Nobody playing league has high IQ lol
[6:34:40] InfinityUnleashed: If they actually stream snipping, you could add a delay on the stream? kinda sus indeed
[6:34:40] novorus92: playing for a push so you dont have a jungle anymore
[6:34:44] Invess: I mean it's sus but for sure I feel
[6:34:44] Karamor: has happened to me before and I don't stream
[6:34:46] Twizzlar: wtf their support is 1v2'ing bot lane
[6:34:48] ghostsofcarcosa: during placements possible
[6:34:50] Papapwnage: youve made it! you are getting stream snipped
[6:34:53] AinzN: Papapwnage Scotland is tired of being ruled by the English so we are trying to get independence so we can be our own country
[6:35:07] Lucien_NM: @ainzn do you own bagpipes
[6:35:09] Fynagle: Always helps to put your overlay over hte map to cover it up. Seen a lot of League streamers do that.
[6:35:13] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa well hopefully one day you can visit and I can take you out for some Haggis
[6:35:21] AinzN: Lucien_NM of course
[6:35:22] bansheehero: I was hoping you would do that before the bus convinced England to leave
[6:35:23] Papapwnage: @AinzN i didnt know you were not independant
[6:35:38] Karamor: @AinzN a bummer about that last vote
[6:35:39] AinzN: Papapwnage I mean it is called the United Kingdom for a reason
[6:35:41] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN I'm down I'll try any food once why not.
[6:36:10] novorus92: all about lane prio i wouldnt call it stream sniping
[6:36:13] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa you'll have to catch it on your own though
[6:36:21] AinzN: Karamor I know! ijpSAD
[6:36:30] ghostsofcarcosa: @Papapwnage Yea both Wales and Scotland are part of the UK. They both have interest in being independent
[6:36:31] Lucien_NM: not the biggest fan of intestines, weird consistency
[6:36:50] 0GHammer: veigar can get stacks all day if the game keeps going
[6:37:07] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN I have to catch the sheep alright I can do that. As someone from Texas who has been on a ranch chasing cattle is something I can do.
[6:37:14] Vendiktuss: your biggest bet is to get into super lategame
[6:37:16] afreak10: dragon
[6:37:17] CamberCYM: Wales' interest in independence isn't feasible. As much as it would be nice
[6:37:18] Papapwnage: All nations should be independant. Nobody serves your best interest that isn't a part of it
[6:37:25] B4rino: !rank
[6:37:25] itmeBOT: As of January 19, 2022, JP is Bronze II in League of Legends (playing Top). This is his second season ever; JP started his League journey in October 2021 and his previous season high was Silver I.
[6:37:31] xmlgprorpx: time to go 60min game where veigar has 1s cd on w and can oneshot every1 KEKW
[6:37:34] ghostsofcarcosa: @CamberCYM That's true just worth mentioning in the context of the UK I suppose.
[6:37:36] 14neo: Objective bounties will save us COPIUM
[6:37:53] afreak10: 3 kills crazy
[6:37:55] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa sheep? Haggis is a little creature from the Highlands that has one leg shorter than the other and you catch it by making run round the other way
[6:37:58] 0GHammer: KEKW that akali
[6:37:58] afreak10: Pog
[6:38:01] CamberCYM: @ghostsofcarcosa There's definitely a growing movement for it though! its worth mentioning
[6:38:02] DrYaguar: KEKW
[6:38:05] SpoonIsTooBig: Veigar do be like that
[6:38:10] Darkaros: 2 for 4 Clap died for the team
[6:38:12] serverfirst300003: akali flash into a stun is priceless
[6:38:13] ReginaldXIV: I can't believe Akali dashed back hahaha
[6:38:14] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN ijpSUS
[6:38:20] Papapwnage: vinigar is stronk
[6:38:31] Lucien_NM: Veigar gets style points for using best Skin
[6:38:32] 14neo: Strippin goes real hard sometimes, when it's least expected - and it pays large dividends like it did there ijpPOGGERS
[6:38:37] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[6:38:45] Atorxke: He smol but stronk
[6:38:49] Karamor: @ReginaldXIV prety sure he thought the stun was about to expire, would have benn a baller play if it did
[6:38:53] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa I used to work in a fancy restaurant that sold Haggis and that was the story I told Americans visiting and they always believed me peepoGiggles
[6:39:07] itmeBOT: We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info: https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[6:39:11] ghostsofcarcosa: That's incredible it's like your version of drop bears lol

[6:39:46] ReginaldXIV: EZ
[6:39:47] ghostsofcarcosa: go go go
[6:39:49] emi225: veigar chonking people holy
[6:39:54] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa pretty much. There was a butchers near me that had fake haggis creatures in their window
[6:39:57] TDotTerror: Veigar the God
[6:40:12] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN That's hilarious.
[6:40:14] LighterTripod: not sure about the snipe but pretty sure your being smurfed by the cami playing this well with TP ign
[6:40:17] serverfirst300003: amumu is the best jungle to carry in low elo, i climbed to gold 2 with just only playing him this season
[6:40:19] novorus92: kiting in bronze dont often see that
[6:40:20] 14neo: awww, unlucky ijpSAD
[6:40:34] Atorxke: She's Carrying
[6:40:36] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa it was basically a haggis with false teeth and googly eyes ijpKEK
[6:40:38] novorus92: trundle is currently the best to climb in low elo jungle
[6:40:56] serverfirst300003: trundle is only good if your team is winning
[6:41:03] novorus92: false
[6:41:03] AinzN: grifff93 some of these players are Silver
[6:41:12] serverfirst300003: thats from experience
[6:41:23] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN ijpKEK the only thing similar to where I'm from is stuff like Frog Legs or Fried alligator...except its just that they actually are real things people eat.
[6:41:25] Lucien_NM: @serverfirst300003 fed trundle can solo carry
[6:41:31] novorus92: i mean i play in Master but im also a support
[6:41:34] xmlgprorpx: elder drag soon tm
[6:41:49] novorus92: but ive been playing for far to long
[6:41:54] Tideshaper: @grifff93 who do you recommend for support in low elo?
[6:41:59] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa funnily enough I have eaten both of those before.
[6:42:07] novorus92: zyra, morgana, senna
[6:42:08] serverfirst300003: i may be a shit tundrel but i know for the fact that i am useless on him if my team is losing, but on amumu engages are everything
[6:42:14] novorus92: leona is cheese
[6:42:17] bansheehero: I had alligator, but not a crocodile :)
[6:42:21] Lucien_NM: @tideshaper blitzcrank, morgana, lux
[6:42:24] 14neo: at least Caitlyn died
[6:42:36] Tideshaper: @grifff93 I play the morg and senna, with some leona so neat
[6:42:38] novorus92: blitz is rough if youre behind at all
[6:42:41] AinzN: @14neo you bet lose? ijpD
[6:42:45] novorus92: senna right now is so broken
[6:42:51] novorus92: shes an auto ban in my elo
[6:42:55] Tideshaper: with her q buff
[6:42:55] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN That's awesome. The frog legs from what I recall is popular in some places in Europe. Alligator obviously a bit weirder, but pretty well known in the states.
[6:42:56] Tideshaper: yeah
[6:43:00] shemg: elder is more important imo
[6:43:00] Darkaros: holy shit the Veigar nuke
[6:43:08] Lucien_NM: as blitz you just have to hit your hooks and pull frail enemies into your team @grifff93
[6:43:14] Vendiktuss: you need taht dragon at all costs
[6:43:16] bansheehero: @AinzN Debbie downer was revealed :)
[6:43:24] novorus92: true but so many people dont land his hooks lmao
[6:43:31] Karamor: some clutch stun walk ins
[6:43:32] serverfirst300003: ye they buffed sena this week right, herd she is busted now
[6:43:37] novorus92: or they end up hooking the wrong champ
[6:43:43] ghostsofcarcosa: Will the believers get their pay day one can dream
[6:43:50] Karamor: @serverfirst300003 build in slow on Q
[6:43:53] Tideshaper: enemy just threw
[6:43:54] titanodin: lol jungle trying to steal
[6:44:12] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa yeah frogs legs are a French thing. And it was either alligator or croc I had at some fancy meat restaurant that had boar, kangaroo and some other meats
[6:44:15] novorus92: dont leave drag
[6:44:18] serverfirst300003: ye that sounds crazy good if u have an adc that follows
[6:44:31] ElPolloBatman: they've got a ward in the pit, should've destroyed it first
[6:44:31] bansheehero: Kangaroo is actually a great meat
[6:44:33] Atorxke: nice bait
[6:44:39] Karamor: this is silver now
[6:44:39] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN Oh wild kangaroo I know that's a thing, but woah.
[6:44:40] AinzN: PepeHands
[6:44:45] Twizzlar: sam gonna smite it
[6:44:47] Invess: jesus that thresh deatrthcry
[6:44:49] CipansR_Ayaya: its always like that in placements
[6:44:51] Papapwnage: you are placed against higher rated players in placements and usually your team-mates are worse
[6:44:55] Fynagle: Splits are common and effective in Bronze, esp if you have a CC advantage.
[6:45:07] afreak10: F
[6:45:08] Twizzlar: ahh so close
[6:45:10] Wholemane: he missed the smite
[6:45:11] Vendiktuss: F
[6:45:11] 0GHammer: so close
[6:45:11] Darkaros: PepeHands
[6:45:21] novorus92: if youre a good split in low elo you always win
[6:45:23] AinzN: So close!
[6:45:29] Wholemane: LUL
[6:45:30] novorus92: thats the biggest issue with low elo
[6:45:32] paradigmshitf: TableHere FlipThis
[6:45:36] Wholemane: Amumu threw this game
[6:45:47] AinzN: Wholemane what you mean?
[6:46:09] Wholemane: That engage right before they initiated elder fucked them
[6:46:21] Atorxke: I feel bad getting the Points
[6:46:22] 14neo: @AinzN i bet just a few points , but yeah - had a bad feeling about that one ijpMONKA
[6:46:23] StarPogPlatinum: LUL
[6:46:26] KingPigJon: Oh god all my money is gone
[6:46:30] lostinpoe: Pssshh we all want to watch JP ;)
[6:46:31] KingPigJon: ;-;
[6:46:31] monamibob: the rage is better here
[6:46:32] Darkaros: PepeHands
[6:46:38] monamibob: and the trassh talk? omg its another level
[6:46:38] AinzN: @14neo I wanted to believe! PepeHands
[6:46:40] Lucien_NM: these tournaments are boring, they are playing alle the same champs over and over again
[6:46:46] Achubra: true damage champions are the worst
[6:47:12] Atorxke: Kreygasm
[6:47:13] Fynagle: It's weird you queue in with the same players in Bronze 1, yet in Bronze 4 I never see the same player.
[6:47:33] serverfirst300003: only reason to watch LCS is to watch DL, sneaky and meteos co streams to see how they shit on their old teammates
[6:47:44] Rhystyrant: That was the Cait from your last game.
[6:47:51] novorus92: Y'a;ll needed an elder and baron to have a chance
[6:47:59] Wholemane: They probably had vision there and saw Amumu
[6:48:06] Rhystyrant: And tje Morg I assume
[6:48:08] 14neo: @Rhystyrant yeah they knew that :O
[6:48:13] Rhystyrant: Ah
[6:48:15] Papapwnage: you were supposed to win the last match via hidden MMR
[6:48:28] Fynagle: If Strippin lost 16LP it means their team was the higher rating.
[6:48:33] ReginaldXIV: I lost 20 LP when I was 29/6/14 as Darius because someone on my team left the match half way through
[6:48:56] Nogardknight: bronzekov brothers
[6:49:03] Pain240: @itmeJP  Demacia ? SeemsGood
[6:49:08] serverfirst300003: @ReginaldXIV that happens all the time, u get those matches back when enemy team has same problem
[6:49:09] ThatWazGuy: wait, it doesn't adjust LP change when the game registers leavers/afk?
[6:49:14] bansheehero: Bronzov is so much better :)
[6:49:20] Karamor: @ReginaldXIV 20? no loss mitigation?
[6:49:20] Atorxke: ouch
[6:49:27] ReginaldXIV: zero mitigation
[6:49:33] Darkaros: That was your first time fighting a non-dogshit Camille, live and learn NODDERS go next
[6:49:40] AinzN: Time to bring out the Kench! hypeE
[6:49:46] Yurogami: isnt tahm support now? or is that next patch
[6:49:47] Achubra: next 3 games are wins
[6:49:48] Karamor: @ReginaldXIV weird.
[6:49:48] ghostsofcarcosa: hypeE unbench you say
[6:49:49] Achubra: easy peasy
[6:49:51] Papapwnage: UNBENCH THE KENCH
[6:50:13] Brahmancer: The toad has been unloaded
[6:50:13] novorus92: kench right now loses half his grey health top lane
[6:50:15] Karamor: @ThatWazGuy it usually does, when someone gets marked as leaver you lose half
[6:50:15] Darkaros: @Yurogami ya this is the patch the nerfed his E but he still seems gudly top
[6:50:18] novorus92: he got a nerf
[6:50:25] jmj1987: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3 Kench time
[6:50:26] Pain240: urgot hmm
[6:50:27] afreak10: ijpF1 ijpF3
[6:50:32] KDogg241: Master Chef POGGERS
[6:50:37] AinzN: grifff93 he's played him a bunch today and yesterday and did great on him
[6:50:42] Atorxke: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF2 ijpF2 ijpF3
[6:50:49] novorus92: its still possible its just not as good
[6:50:50] teeders: zero ad damage GL
[6:51:03] ThatWazGuy: @Yurogami idk why they keep wanting him to be support. There's other supports who do what he does as support but better
[6:51:10] Wholemane: ye 100% AP
[6:51:31] novorus92: they want him to be a supp becuase he was designed for it
[6:51:35] AinzN: Donger mid?
[6:51:36] serverfirst300003: ye but his buff that instead of slow now he 40% faster after he swallowed someone is annoying af
[6:51:44] Karamor: dodging in promos is a loss
[6:51:47] ghostsofcarcosa: First prediction first blood place your bets
[6:51:51] gobbothegreen: omg this game is lost
[6:51:51] ThatWazGuy: @grifff93 not very well i guess anneKappa
[6:51:52] sehxiedonuts: I think if oyu dodge in placement it goes as a lose
[6:51:57] SamMFJackson: i think u get penalized if u dodge during promo
[6:51:57] gobbothegreen: heimer, yuumi, veigar
[6:52:08] 45pringles: you cant dodge in placments somone else has to do it for you
[6:52:13] ThatWazGuy: I'm always tempted to ban yuumi because bronze yuumis are awful
[6:52:18] Papapwnage: all ap!
[6:52:19] afreak10: u get penalty tho
[6:52:24] shatteredsaint: team yordle
[6:52:26] titanodin: your the tank without you this is a straight loss
[6:52:48] Karamor: strippin should go tnak diana, it's surprisingly good
[6:53:02] afreak10: cait will feast on ur team if she's good
[6:53:17] AinzN: Chat more of you need to start believing! ijpPRAY
[6:53:18] shemg: Sam can just dodge for you I think
[6:53:50] SamMFJackson: that always drove me nuts about climbing, like to climb u gotta get on big win streaks, then continue that into promos... seems rough
[6:54:14] bansheehero: coxNotThatDrunk coxHypers coxNotThatDrunk
[6:54:21] TheXtractor: @SamMFJackson the system is made for you to grind not for you to see your 'real' rank :D
[6:54:26] Stegin: wait, urgot just moves over minions?
[6:54:37] itmeBOT: Want to support the stream? Why not go like and share JP's gone live tweet? https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1484954023023329283
[6:54:37] gobbothegreen: The system they have for wild rift is way more feelgood at least
[6:55:03] SamMFJackson: @SamMFJackson idk, grind for me, is like 10 games a week tops
[6:55:12] AinzN: Stegin his legs don't count as part of his hitbox or something someone said the other day
[6:55:15] afreak10: gj
[6:55:23] 14neo: this 'promo' system is probably what i'd end up hating most about LoL personally monkaHmm

[6:55:51] ashla11: or promos
[6:55:52] ThatWazGuy: the guy literally walked up to all in against a full minion wave anneS
[6:55:53] serverfirst300003: ye and they changed it so many times already most of ppl hate it
[6:55:54] bansheehero: 10k to 113k just before it ended, less gamba more lucky number slevin :D
[6:55:57] SamMFJackson: @ashla11 u have to win 2/3
[6:56:21] Stegin: AinzN that's interesting
[6:56:38] Wholemane: its 3 out of 5
[6:56:39] TheXtractor: @ashla11 Its basically like a best of 5. you win 3 of the 5 games you are in the next division. But its a bad system since matchmaking goes wonky during promos
[6:56:41] Wholemane: that you have to win
[6:56:56] TheXtractor: You almost always gets worse teammates or extra hard enemies during promos
[6:57:15] Papapwnage: ekko prob wont ever solo drag
[6:57:18] ashla11: can you fall out of silver if you make the promotion though?
[6:57:29] Phen0m: The fact that they hinge personal ranking on team based results is inherently flawed
[6:57:31] DrYaguar: @Wholemane IIRC if you fail once but get to promos again you start with one win already
[6:57:34] Insigmada: wonder what the pass rate for promos are.
[6:57:42] Wholemane: @Wholemane yes
[6:57:49] TheXtractor: @ashla11 once you are in a rank i dont think you can fall off anymore. they removed that a while ago i believe.
[6:58:02] SamMFJackson: there should also be demotion series imo, there was numerous times i would win promos, then lose like 2-3 in a row and be demoted again
[6:58:02] TheXtractor: at least unless you are in the high ranks like challenger/master

[7:12:14] Wholemane: LUL
[7:12:19] bansheehero: @milkyjsy Promotion is based on wins in a role playing team game?
[7:12:20] Darkaros: @milkyjsy A serious answer is that Bronze/Silver is like 70% of the playerbase. There's a pretty wide skill range even within Bronze since it's early season, Riot deliberately pushed back everyone 5-ish ranks from last season, and everyone's trying to get out
[7:12:28] SamMFJackson: yeah, we need the PJ scream clip, lol
[7:12:37] serverfirst300003: i can feel your pain for sure, this game can infuriate when u see ppl with literally room temp IQs, some of the shit ive seen just make me wanna reach through the screen and punch the fk out of them

[7:12:45] Papapwnage: @bansheehero i think they removed that dumb shit. Like you cant be a diamond support and iron top
[7:12:50] ThatWazGuy: the thing about league's rank system is that some people in bronze deserve to be there, some people deserve iron, and some deserve Gold. Good luck with your team :)
[7:13:07] Ikkarrow: lane yes jungle no
[7:13:08] Invess: does yuumi literally go in the pocket

[7:13:14] Eyeofthehawks: I dont think jungle exp is shared anymore
[7:13:25] TheXtractor: getting higher ranks is as much of a time investment as it is a skill investment. its a grind  yo
[7:13:25] bansheehero: @Papapwnage Missing the point, in a more flexible game you could take over roles others fail to do. Here you lose and cannot do much about it.
[7:13:27] Eyeofthehawks: too many ragequits from blue shared exp lul
[7:13:31] bansheehero: so it becomes a game of numbers
[7:13:36] afreak10: 5 mid

[7:28:48] Phen0m: @Senojcye silver is a mixed bag. People know a bit more what's happening and have overall better mechanical skills, but also lots of people who think they are better then they really are
[7:28:51] Nickonil: i completely agree
[7:29:07] Eyeofthehawks: Yeah youll get out, then youll be saying the same thing about Silver KEKW

[7:36:22] Eyeofthehawks: 50%, you either do or you dont
[7:36:39] Darkaros: JP's mentioned the Dark Souls 3 twice already. Exploit was old in the first place it's just getting more publicity due to abuse

[7:49:36] serverfirst300003: 1 min cd
[7:49:38] Snowplex: she can but not right now
[7:49:39] Eyeofthehawks: it fires a slowing thing that doesnt do much damage, but slows. But if you drop below 25% health it instakills you

[9:22:49] stringz: no advice/backseating in here I believe @Prophet181
[9:22:53] Darkaros: jokes aside JP already knows about the center of Sett punch interaction, Sam told him bout it earlier
[9:23:04] Prophet181: It says backseating allowed in the stream tags
[9:23:09] Miros__: @Prophet181 Because 1) he's aware, and 2) he realy doesn't like people telling him how to play
[9:23:13] Baske_T: ward!
[9:23:23] BigBadFerg: that is indeed one of the tags

[9:31:47] NuAera: yea mastery 7 dont really mean anything, u can farm that in norms :)
[9:31:52] AinzN: ghostsofcarcosa that's what I'm thinking as well
[9:32:08] AinzN: I'll do a little bet on win
[9:32:31] Darkaros: literally the equivalent of bragging about the hours you have in a game while still being at X shit rank
[9:32:33] InternetPlumber: that is what we call failing upward
[9:32:54] Gat0rCh0mp: lux missed everything until she hit the ult

[9:34:25] Cellonious: That is sad, so much gameplay with one champ and you are bad
[9:34:25] Karamor: @galdamesh play long enough and you will get a few suicide trolls on the other teams handing you a few free S
[9:34:30] 14neo: 'falling off soon' - reallly?!
[9:34:43] GrievAY: Yea, bragging about being Mastery 7 is like bragging that you ride a bike. Tills nothing of how well you do it or your understanding

[9:36:28] mistertiggles14: Not as good as the lux who used Q to steal it from JP's team a few days ago lol
[9:37:10] epicshoo: aphelios always seems like that champ where he's garbage on your team but godlike on the enemy team

[9:44:58] ReginaldXIV: no idea how JP lived
[9:45:04] TDotTerror: Amumu threw that like dollar bills in the club.
[9:45:10] AinzN: He lived because he's the God King! hypeE
[9:45:18] ghostsofcarcosa: The God King lives
[9:45:20] Karamor: @ReginaldXIV steraks, W, lux shield

[9:49:06] Darkaros: 0 damage modCheck
[9:49:22] breadgravy: just played a game where Zeri on my team went 29/3/5
[9:49:23] Darkaros: Ya apparently he has Thornmail and a bunch of armor items vs your AP team
[9:49:26] CinnamonToastKen: man even with the spin armor shred

[9:50:12] Karamor: winions
[9:50:23] SchnellBier: mid KEKW
[9:50:41] Darkaros: I'm so used to Dota and yelling at supports to auto attack
[9:50:44] breadgravy: yeah I'm playing zyra, getting paired with a lot of Zeri on bot, and I believe it.
[9:50:56] Darkaros: because they cast their spells and are like "welp sucks I don't have hands to bludgeon this 50 HP hero to death"
[9:51:14] CinnamonToastKen: seems like lux doesnt know her auto is empowered after she lands shit
[9:51:34] Darkaros: ya idk how LoL works maybe she has a reason to not just walk up and attack ijpSUFFER maybe
[9:51:36] Shoaron: people always underestimate how much dmg auto attacks deal
[9:51:42] SoulCrusher842: lol did Ammu's model bug

[9:53:27] Gat0rCh0mp: winions are gonna slow their push off of that for a second
[9:53:30] ReginaldXIV: Lux flopping for soul screwed the match
[9:53:44] CinnamonToastKen: thats asking too much

[9:54:13] Kalamtas: I never believe in apheilios in these ranks tbh
[9:54:20] mbryer07: how has that team not broken your base with a full build trist
[9:54:22] ReginaldXIV: Lux abandoned JP in a winnable 2v2
[9:54:27] ReginaldXIV: then they got soul
[9:54:28] mbryer07: she breaths and towers fall
[9:54:31] TDotTerror: 0/29 Lulu monkaS

[9:54:40] mistertiggles14: Their Lux has decent mechanics, but is a terrible player
[9:54:56] Atorxke: weird they didn't hard push for the win
[9:55:01] Darkaros: Ya, Lux is good on a "cast abilities and hit people" level and is rough elsewhere
[9:55:12] Doctor_Broteus: so is there something for league that shows some good skill progressions? thinking of starting but have no item or hero knowledge
[9:55:26] Kalamtas: nice peel by lulu
[9:55:28] NuAera: mid is like dead too, the tower and base almost exposed
[9:55:30] StarPogPlatinum: They were too far Crungo

[9:56:25] ritchie313: I didn't think you could demote
[9:56:27] Atorxke: I wish I believed in Annie

[9:56:53] Kalamtas: jp is really committed to league today

[9:57:07] AinzN: CinnamonToastKen why you got to be mean! ijpSAD
[9:57:10] Darkaros: 2 more wins
[9:57:11] InternetPlumber: wow. getting harassed in twitch chat and in game chat
[9:57:30] RlDennis: Baron was unfortunate tbh. Lux cast her abilities just as the Baron was resetting so it healed back up
[9:57:40] mistertiggles14: Was Aphelios the support to Brand? lol
[9:58:00] Darkaros: that game was such a trainwreck i don't even remember the lanes/positions lol
