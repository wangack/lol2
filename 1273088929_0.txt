[2:50:07] Moobot: Stay up to date on all the important LPL news on our Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/lplenglish
[2:50:11] KilluaViBritannia: edg made history last year, no one thought they gon win, this year its gon be a T1 miracle
[2:50:20] sephiroxical19981202: Bin played well last game when RNG played through him
[2:50:42] nhang14: @KilluaViBritannia T1 KEKW
[2:50:46] MarxistTurtle: @KilluaViBritannia everyone considered edg top 4 team only delusional lck fanboys underestimated them
[2:50:47] shakysheki: with how lec is looking its going to be lck vs lpl once again
[2:50:51] bluesclues96: @KilluaViBritannia no, most people who watched LPL knew that EDG was a strong contender, i didnt expected DK to win at all
[2:50:53] KilluaViBritannia: flexed up in the picture
[2:51:16] 03c63ef3: k3llyDJ
[2:51:24] LmaoLp: @KilluaViBritannia edg was my crystal ball :>
[2:51:31] longkazama: @KilluaViBritannia cringe EU boys ranked FPX top because of Doinb and Nuguri LUL
[2:51:35] KilluaViBritannia: @bluesclues96 i was expecting a T1 vs EDG finals, but the rookies messed up in the end
[2:51:43] look_pagoda: @ryanchen879 alright but judging from one series pretty unfair , theshy was so inconsistent last year LUL
[2:51:45] nhang14: @KilluaViBritannia but oner, keria and gumayushi can improve a lot though
[2:51:50] longkazama: then they got shit on during worlds
[2:51:50] ÏùÄÏùÄÌïúÏûøÎπõ: Faker was killed by Clozer today LUL
[2:52:01] KilluaViBritannia: lmao I knew FPX was gon lose, the players were busy doing adverts and partying all year
[2:52:12] bluesclues96: @KilluaViBritannia for me it could've been either T1 or DK, but yeah canna inted so hard
[2:52:19] ouatssss: @look_pagoda have you seen the rng games? Bin wandering around during teamfights, he's not intergrating with the team well, but he's definitely improving
[2:52:43] KilluaViBritannia: canna deserved getting traded 100%
[2:52:46] bluesclues96: @look_pagoda @ouatssss 100% agreed
[2:52:56] longkazama: @look_pagoda I judge because of many factors (1) his peak form (2) his freedom in IG (3) his stricter training in WGB (4) he has been carrying WGB every game
[2:52:58] bluesclues96: @KilluaViBritannia yeah for sure
[2:53:13] LmaoLp: @ouatssss if anything, i'd say it's overall huge comms issues for RNG
[2:53:39] longkazama: @look_pagoda meanwhile RNG is a already superteam already they were on par with EDG last world and xiaohu is a monster
[2:53:49] look_pagoda: @kingsaveyou yeah hes still needs time to adapt but hes def better than theshy
[2:53:51] Omek6: NODDERS
[2:53:54] KilluaViBritannia: @look_pagoda you gotta remember theshy has just recovered from a career ending injury, he is just now this year fully healed
[2:54:04] nhang14: after Lunar New year though, WBG will potentially lose everygame because holy shit their opponents are monkaS
[2:54:11] ubisoftimcoming: xiaoming
[2:54:11] papayasmithy: rng is not the same level as edg, sorry
[2:54:18] shakysheki: i think bin and wei has something going on, glad that he seems to communicate with him now
[2:54:22] KilluaViBritannia: who wins RNG or IG?
[2:54:26] look_pagoda: @killuavibritannia i hope so
[2:54:28] ljpnb66: LCK best regionÔºü
[2:54:30] bluesclues96: @look_pagoda dude he won worlds with this arm injury, imagine what he could do if he never got injured
[2:54:40] bluesclues96: @KilluaViBritannia RNG for sure
[2:54:41] longkazama: @nhang14 hopefully so this team needs a wakeup call

[2:58:24] Asura272: RNG badly needs a worlds trophy
