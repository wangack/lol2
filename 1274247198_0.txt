[2:00:56] GeNoFPaniC: @KilluaViBritannia yeah but not at the start of a Split when you just lost 2 bo3 in a row after starting 3-0. in the LPL anyone can beat anyone so I highly doubt that it was meant like that

[2:04:03] TheOreoCupcake: @GeNoFPaniC If they get 8 or 7th, they'll be happy with it. It's been a long time since a team went undefeated in the LPL so even if we expect EDG to drop a game, it's plausible that to go to 7 or 8 with 10-6 or something.

[2:05:50] Tyronefriedchickens: i thought BLG was the first game tonight?
[2:05:52] TheOreoCupcake: @GeNoFPaniC And playoff brackets are weird af. So lets say TES get 7th and OMG get 8th, OMG will be plenty happy to know they won't face a very strong team in the immediate next round.
[2:06:05] dazewow: They play really late, why dont they play like NA (Afternoons)
