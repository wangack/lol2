[2:46:18] chhopsky: Vici
[2:46:33] chhopsky: @Angiefoxtrot yeah! i feel so bad for him. LS told him to get the hell off the desk SIX TIMES last week
[2:46:36] fnask10: I think GT is best of the 3 i mentioned
[2:46:45] AngieFoxtrot: argh, that's just rude
[2:46:59] chhopsky: yeah like dude we get it no-one is a bigger nerd than you, that doesnt make them useless

[2:47:53] dragonboy122: gg
[2:48:00] ciriotian: Noob
[2:48:05] fnask10: I like how LS talked about mortal kombat as if everyone knows who "Cyrax" is.. Why cant he just say yellow ninja like rest of the world
[2:48:07] Rilaro: he casts spot tv lck slot

[2:49:14] chhopsky: @fnaskpojkenx that was really shitty, ive never heard of cyrax before so like way to directly insult your audience dude
[2:49:18] Mekaco: gg
[2:49:37] Rilaro: Bengi and Faker synergize super well, he plays way better with bengi than when he plays with blank or peanut
[2:50:11] fnask10: I wasnt insulted by not knowing who cyrax is.. I was more thinking LS cant just assume everyone spent their entire life reading comic books lol
[2:50:29] AngieFoxtrot: @chhopsky, I'm always willing to change my mind about a person, but geeze that sort of behavior is not a good look
[2:51:03] FishRoeSoup: 4.4K lee sin PogChamp is that 4396
[2:51:04] Rilaro: LS co caster thought that batman had the power to turn into a bat
[2:51:17] PulseIRL: @Angiefoxtrot <3

[2:53:27] chhopsky: @Angiefoxtrot yeah same. tbh i do not enjoy disliking casters, but ive never seen someone bus their co-workers and audience so badly before
[2:53:31] kingkarus: <message deleted> Kappa

[2:53:58] xmastime4life: pulse lost his job FeelsBadMan
[2:54:00] luccid: Who?
[2:54:01] AngieFoxtrot: The Crumbz meme'ing was so bad
[2:54:19] PulseIRL: @Rilaro Yeah a lot of it was a meme train but if enough people didn't like my casting then I need to change/improve which is what I'm doing
[2:54:21] Rilaro: i honestly couldn't tell you what his name is lol, he just sounds and casts like pulse
[2:54:32] PulseIRL: @Rilaro That's Vedius

[2:59:41] Rilaro: if i had to do like an hour podcast solo thats similar to public speaking for me
[2:59:51] Drinkss: I actually want to try casting, but i feel like i would suck
[3:00:01] takua16: only caster i know of that can do a good solo cast is doa when a few years back he had to solo cast a lck game
[3:00:04] fnask10: I dont know what to think of NB vs Snake, both these teams have looked so bad lately. Why was SoFM even playing support and their adc was jungling? i dont know what's going on there
[3:00:15] boogahboo: play league with friends and flame their plays is a good start Kappa

[3:06:08] boogahboo: new urgot models Kreygasm
[3:06:10] Rilaro: why do all junglers have that hint of toxicity ?
[3:06:24] Rilaro: i remember when i first started playing i was an udyr main, and i was toxic af
[3:06:45] razlol: tbh all roles are TOXIC
[3:06:50] boogahboo: you go to soloq, team losing you are blamed, team losing but you are doing well you want to flame them FeelsBadMan
[3:06:56] kitlit: ss or newbee guys
[3:07:22] boogahboo: you see the whole map as jungle and are more prompted to judge people
[3:07:22] Rilaro: but if you look at the pro's a lot of junglers had have that reputation of being "locker room cancer"
[3:07:24] FishRoeSoup: now i just rather not reply to teammates, better to save brain cell to actually think about the game

[3:09:32] AngieFoxtrot: lmao Frosk
[3:09:32] FishRoeSoup: Is Inori toxic? I thought he is fine from his interviews
[3:09:49] Rilaro: your kind of passively deciding who's good/ bad to spend time on
[3:10:11] Rilaro: yea man he's been toxic in solo q and they kicked out adrian cause they couldn't get along with each other
[3:10:11] kingkarus: sofm ls sp inc =))

[3:13:14] kingkarus: flandre?
[3:13:36] kingkarus: but why?
[3:13:45] Rilaro: I bet reignover is gonna have this same drama with his teamates, cause he's always gonna pick Piglets lane , like lourlo and bot are never gonna get attention
[3:14:02] Rilaro: but piglet looks good on dps mages
[3:14:04] YOLOallRARES: camile gg nb win
