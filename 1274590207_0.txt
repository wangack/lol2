[1:05:00] jruhro: to be fair she doesn't ever really get a ton of character development herself to know what she thinks about anything
[1:05:03] GaryArkham: Scott rules in the Astonishing and in Uncanny Origins
[1:05:05] MrMX0121: They didn't really give him anything to do in the second and third film. They killed him in the third film because he decided to join Superman Returns.
[1:05:07] BaosilisK: i think i agree with that jp ijpHMM
[1:05:16] KatjeMauw: wolvie was a hairy unkempt short dude, scott is tall and shaved
[1:05:16] MasqureMan: I think he’s usually a dick when Wolverine is around, and that’s the only time we see the characters
[1:05:17] riku_kopiku: they are a throuple because Logan and Scott wanna bang
[1:05:26] Orby1983: then in X3 they just kill him :(
[1:05:42] DyingEros: KEKW
[1:05:49] WDPrescott_: No, it was that 2000s and people didn't like Captain America and Suprman like characters, which Cyclopes is for X-men, so they just sabotaged the caracter

[1:29:49] Reijm11: iron man would just make a plastic polymer suit
[1:29:53] SabertoothEwok: X-men have always worked really strangely when incorporated into greater Marvel
[1:29:59] TerminallyHealthy: Storm wielded Mjolnir
[1:29:59] Cob_daBear: would be non-ferrous
[1:30:03] KeyxLock: send mutants to the mage circles in dragon age
[1:30:05] KeyxLock: that worked out
[1:30:05] zynessa: @Zrmi Wasn't she married to T'challa at some point too?
[1:30:14] Hundisilm: Superman though
[1:30:17] Zrmi: @Zrmi in comics yes
[1:30:22] Sonatta: i think that's why the Inhumans never hit with me... because they're always Walmart Mutants
[1:30:24] CtrlAltComplete: just get wanda to say "No more mutants"
[1:30:29] riku_kopiku: they really like justifying culling mutants
[1:30:34] Hundisilm: Isn't the plot of xmen basically the same as the plot of superman something
[1:30:48] Reijm11: several current mcu members are also alot stronger then they are shown now like Thor and Hulk
[1:30:51] Zrmi: Power already skyrocket with Scarlett Witch and Captain Marvel
[1:30:58] LeelandGrant: if you have ethernals in the mcu, Mutants should be no problem powerlevel wise
[1:30:59] KeyxLock: scarlet witch can always just be used to nullify the mutants again
[1:31:03] DaRandalizer: power creep!!!
[1:31:05] FightsCrime: I think they're gonna go Powers of X/House of X with it, Cerebo and Xaxier hid the mutants from humans globally

[1:31:42] Tronix_604: alpha flight! and puck LUL
[1:31:57] dranzyl: there was a nice convo with iron man and cyclops during civil war about registration (sokovia accords). cyclops says are you going to register people because of their birth
[1:32:00] chicacherri: the SEntinels?
[1:32:05] Hundisilm: They are talking about superman righ?
[1:32:29] IToldYouItsTaken: is hulk technically a mutant coxBut
[1:32:39] Zrmi: @IToldYouItsTaken no
[1:32:40] SZebra: Where does the Fantastic Four fit into that?
[1:32:40] Sonatta: the Uncanny Avengers was a great run though
[1:32:41] KeyxLock: wolverine was always the middle man between the xmen and avengers
[1:33:00] MasqureMan: @itoldyouitstaken mutate, although it makes more sense to me if he was a mutant
[1:33:02] CtrlAltComplete: agree. x men separate
[1:33:03] Zaelsus: They could jump straight into a Krakoa situationwith the mutants
[1:33:06] dranzyl: thats the beast he was an avenger
[1:33:11] jruhro: If you introduce the XMen and as the universe expands, that whole question of "well, where was this person during this huge threat in this other movie" gets way worse
[1:33:12] EndyBT: I mean , beast is an avenger
[1:33:18] gooseboy429: doctor strange will lead into mutants
[1:33:30] ThemDemo: After watching Eternals again, they focused so HEAVILY on evolution. Sersi talking to Darwin, the deviants literally evolving in front of our eyes, etc. The mutants are created in the Eternals comics right? I wonder if they are planning to bring mutants in through the Eternals sequel
[1:33:31] kooshy_j: I wanted Storm to show up in Black Panther so badly
[1:33:33] Zrmi: Hulk didn't mutate because of a mutant gen. So no mutant
[1:33:35] KingRahe: i just want my avengers vs xmen movie
[1:33:43] FightsCrime: @jruhro Powers of X addresses this pretty well with Xavier erasing the information from human minds
[1:33:57] KingRahe: yeah hulk and spider man are extants because they werent born mutants
[1:34:05] TerminallyHealthy: Black Panther 2 if it has a war with Atlantis should have first mutant appearance with Namor
[1:34:06] IToldYouItsTaken: @Zrmi what are you the mutant police roo4
[1:34:08] sotasty_: are they going to do a xmen movie?
[1:34:18] SpaceDive: eventually yea

[1:34:20] gimpx0r_cpa: hawkeye too
