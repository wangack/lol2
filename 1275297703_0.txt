[1:20:21] ArcaicoH: @e3o_o Up can hold game for more than 40min easily, this (if necessary) will gain time to corki spike.
[1:20:21] YakHerd: up draft is higher damage and easier to execute. But they kinda have to stay together. IG could potentially spread the map.
[1:20:27] ezilys_: this match is over 32 minute?
[1:20:33] perfectrotation7: @concacvn11 its better if they can execute it. its so hard to make all of it mesh

[3:41:22] TJKlaenn: Veigar in Pro Play soon? Hopefully? When 12.2 hits, maybe.
[3:41:22] bottom2g: @shrimp_baguette Aphelios is a very difficult champion which means most people can't play him well. Also, he's an immobile ADC, which makes him very vulnerable. This means his team needs to peel for him. Both of these factors makes him bad in solo queue, but good in pro play.
