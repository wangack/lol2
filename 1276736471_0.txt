[0:32:46] poooookey: review headline here was: most fun and ugliest pokemon game in years
[0:32:54] Acheron13: That's why Nintendo doesn't bother to improve the graphics. People will buy it no matter what
[0:32:55] TehMud: Gameplay seems fun just ugly
[0:32:56] Marcloure: Likely in comparison to other Pokemoin games
[0:32:56] Killercds: The consensus seems to be "Looks crap, but fun gameplay"
[0:32:58] espi: @Darkaros worst specs than my fridge display LUL
[0:32:59] Haeher: i feel like the problem with "new" is if pokemon players want something new and experimental or just heir standard pokemon Hmm
[0:33:02] SkywardRaven: It's pretty good tbh, once you get past how dogshti it looks
[0:33:04] Thebestbubbles: It makes sense that the graphics look pixelated and cheap, it is a small indie studio making, you know pokemon the biggest media franchise in the world

[0:33:49] ChiZWorkshop: It really unfortunately looks like they didn't give the art team enough time
[0:33:49] JuIgDeMaUr: It leaked a few days ago

[0:35:13] Scottyshome: that brand is literally unable to sleep.  How the heck could you get mastery 7 like him
[0:35:17] Irvatar: I hope the game is good, might be a reason to break way more from their old game format.
[0:35:20] TehMud: Wait Pokemon has a story?
[0:35:24] XIIIthHour: oh, good, I was going to ask if you wrote him a scathing tweet. LUL

[0:35:30] GrateWhiteDope: Pokemon was the only game I had in 2000
[0:35:31] paintedsteel: I might consider getting a switch only if you can fly a charizard or dragonite.
[0:35:31] kapjak: that's because you were a kid then
[0:35:33] Galoari: i thought it was too simplistic when i was a kid, but i liked it, now i just cant get into it
[0:35:34] Haeher: kinda dependa on the person rooIsee
[0:35:38] yrvengalied: tell that to pokemon go PepeLaugh

[0:35:45] Skyform: pokemon is still fun but it's stale on the innovation side
[0:35:46] Puvis: Guess some people just outgrow it and cant relate to it anymore
[0:35:46] Marc326: "it's not fun, stop playing it BabyRage stop enjoying things it's too late"
[0:35:46] larkhill: yes
[0:35:46] NoordSz: these guys live in huts yet have a ball that can turn a monster into energy and store it in some dimensional pocket space
[0:35:47] CapsuleCorpEmployee: yup
[0:35:48] Darkaros: ofc there are
[0:35:48] Acheron13: You liked Pokemon when you were 15, not 35
[0:35:48] afreak10: yes
[0:35:49] ThemDemo: Yeah
[0:35:49] Sonatta: the popularity of Pokemon Go disagrees with that take
[0:35:49] xystus_: yes
[0:35:50] Gecko185: yes
[0:35:51] Tronmakers: yes there are shinies
[0:35:51] GivTater: Yes they have shinys

[0:35:55] Shapelessdnb: Bruh, Pokemon is good. If only this shit wasnt switch only
[0:35:56] ReginaldXIV: Shinies? RIP Fubuki
[0:35:58] akmannen: JP did you watch boba fett today if not it was very good can recommend 👍
[0:35:59] BlueSapphyre: @TehMud very complex story. on the scale of zelda's storyline.
[0:36:01] jmj1987: i might buy a switch for this
[0:36:04] ItsBatsy: Its the first game where you can see them in the overworld
[0:36:07] bloodrayne316: so just cause people played it doesn't mean everyone gonna have same opinion
[0:36:12] wampastomppa: if there are no shinies then it's a 1/10
[0:36:14] DD_The_Shmey: @akmannen ahhh, I'm watching it today
[0:36:14] ThePezinator30125: boba fett Pog
[0:36:17] epicshoo: can we throw a big ass rock and knock them out?
[0:36:19] ChiZWorkshop: good choice honestly
[0:36:20] ryanfazz2: I wish it had pvp so you had something to grind for
[0:36:25] espi: that transition tho
[0:36:26] Lihapiiras: Good choice. Slow starter.
[0:36:28] gedeff: pokemon encourages animal cruelty. this game should be boycotted
[0:36:38] novafreez3: KEKW

[0:37:06] espi: D:
[0:37:06] sapphirescale: lol
[0:37:07] Devlind: You know when you catch a Pokemon with the ball, and it attempts to escape. Is it not the same as forcefully enslaving the Pokemon?
[0:37:08] CDubTheRIPper: monkaW
[0:37:10] zymioi: the real question is should i buy this or monster hunter stories 2

[0:37:14] wampastomppa: fully sentient animals
[0:37:17] pyroshine: monkaW
[0:37:23] ChiZWorkshop: I just feel kind of bad for this game's visuals when Genshin Impact exists on mobile
[0:37:26] The_AshenOne__: quinPsycho
[0:37:32] NoorElBahrain: CrungoCycle
[0:37:35] espi: bidoof?

[0:37:45] Nguyendex: different monsters? D:
[0:37:46] larkhill: that tree looks sad
[0:37:49] Imbadyoureworse: I know some people really looking forward to this game so I hope it’s good for their sake
[0:37:54] p1llus: I wish this game had more color, or is that just me? It looks so brown
[0:37:56] espi: the grass doesn't even catch fire Kappa
[0:37:59] HadoForReal: "at at at night"
[0:38:05] CDubTheRIPper: Hmm
[0:38:06] Darkaros: ChiZWorkshop you really shouldn't. many mobile devices unironically have better hardware than the switch. there's a reason why Genshin isn't on there
[0:38:08] SgtStruthers: How is there no VA in a 2022 game zekeKEK
[0:38:09] Aurugorn: this looks so dumb
[0:38:12] Ribbons_Almark: is that a new pokemon?
[0:38:12] Irvatar: @chizworkshop aren't phones way stronger than Nintendo Switch?
[0:38:14] epicshoo: throw bombs at them? KKona
[0:38:17] yrvengalied: am gonna be honest i will get this game play it for like 3 hours to catch some pokemon then just shelf it cause how lost i am and forgot what i had to do
[0:38:17] Haeher: @ChiZWorkshop i mean genshin looks good on pc i odnt feel like it looks much better then this on mobile monkaHmm but maybe im misremembering
[0:38:21] bloodrayne316: I'm looking forward to this and not really Pokemon fan
[0:38:26] espi: @p1llus yeah seriously, it's not only low-res textures, but the art direction is terrible
[0:38:32] BlueSapphyre: @Ribbons_Almark hisui region scyther.
[0:38:33] Otschboh: Riviting game play LUL
[0:38:40] larkhill: but can i dodge roll the boss like dark souls
[0:38:43] Manyfist: Nintendo Switch is like 2-4 generations behind other consoles
[0:38:44] ReginaldXIV: Genshin could work on Switch
[0:38:45] Ribbons_Almark: @BlueSapphyre oh cool!
[0:38:47] afreak10: no shit
[0:39:09] Galoari: @ReginaldXIV does it run on high at 120 fps like on my phone? :D
[0:39:12] GrateWhiteDope: LUL Animation wasn't in the budget
[0:39:13] Irvatar: @reginaldxiv I doubt it
[0:39:16] Nogardknight: read: monster hunter stories Kappa
[0:39:22] DejaDrew: How does anyone like this garbage
[0:39:26] ReginaldXIV: Genshin caps at 60 fps
[0:39:26] SgtStruthers: The profit margin on these games must be huge
[0:39:33] Dredstryde: No VA ResidentSleeper
[0:39:35] Galoari: @ReginaldXIV it's 120 on iphone 13
[0:39:38] Shoaron: !
[0:39:41] Aurugorn: great clip LUL
[0:39:45] jankenprime: I like that reviewer, seems very objective
[0:39:47] Sonatta: how many 10 year olds do you think will notice any of those short comings or even care?
[0:39:48] Miklagard: I prefer pokemon cries over them repeating their name over and over and over and over again NODDERS
[0:39:48] Galoari: there was an update for it
[0:39:49] DD_The_Shmey: This game would be Slammin if it had came out in 2006
[0:39:53] BlazeRom: solid 30 bucks game
[0:39:54] Joelyo23: way too high
[0:39:55] SgtStruthers: didnt sound like an 9

[0:39:59] GrateWhiteDope: Almost a perfect game Kappa
[0:40:00] Jtbrig1: @itmeJP Don't know if they will touch on it since this is pre-release but its suppose to have some kind of raid endgame with multiplayer as well
[0:40:00] Jack_Peevey: wow, these scores are..... weird
[0:40:00] Marcloure: Pokemon overall is overrated
[0:40:01] NoordSz: nostalgia does wonders
[0:40:01] Tyronin: i feel like this is a good start to great new way to do it
[0:40:01] P4ste: lackluster - 9/10!

[0:40:15] jaxkmurphy: That is literally the donkey game reviewer meme @itmejp
[0:40:15] DeadlyBrother: is it the nostalgia for people? i don't see anything good in that
[0:40:18] bloodrayne316: looks like only Pokemon that I interested in
[0:40:21] ciritus: Isnt that genereally Nintendo games to get high score
[0:40:21] Vladan997: the only reason it is that high is because it is pokemon nothing more or less
