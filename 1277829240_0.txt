[0:20:13] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[0:20:13] bansheehero: Its about as good as Mando and Mando was igreat

[0:20:23] one_kiwi_wolf: i love it all
[0:20:25] Jaydenhaze: you will like episode 5
[0:20:30] Larrith: Bobba Fett is a good show.
[0:20:31] BlackTidus: how weird is it that disney is streaming that new pamela anderson movie
[0:20:32] Inoyu: because people are dumb
[0:20:33] SlipCrit: i think star wras fans are just perpetually mad
[0:20:35] ftwNatsu: what series are we talking about?
[0:20:37] JohnWoosKid: The lowrider speeder bikes were kinda wqierd but I like the show
[0:20:40] Khaos_Void: I really dont get the hate, it can get silly but i like it
[0:20:45] Wasnii: its such a budget show. the acting is horrendous
[0:20:45] WDForty: some ppl don't like the many flashbacks cause they can't get their brain around the timelines, i personally don't have any problems with flashbacks/time jumps
[0:20:46] ChiZWorkshop: As a Star Wars fan I can honestly say Star Wars fans kinda suck
[0:20:47] NoorElBahrain: @ftwNatsu The Book of Boba Fett
[0:20:47] Julia: i love the show too, it has its own flavour
[0:20:49] Theravos: in episode 5 you find out Bruce Willis was dead the whole time
[0:20:50] Jormunduur: @itmeJP People just need to learn to enjoy content, rather than be hyper critical of everything
[0:20:53] MrWeedoz: they hate boba took off the helmet
[0:20:53] rAKAye: spoilers !
[0:20:54] ghostsofcarcosa: little lizard was my favorite bit
[0:20:54] SabertoothEwok: People have a really conflated view of what Boba Fett is despite having essentially no actual character development befotre this show
[0:20:55] Jormunduur: Mos Vespa LUL
[0:20:56] BlazeRom: sure wish disney+ would start becoming available in my country Madge
[0:20:56] PchelaPchela: I watched ep1 and thought it was bad, you're saying it gets worse...
[0:21:07] bacon_greece: power ranger vespas LUL
[0:21:09] EvoCaliber: ijpNODDERS
[0:21:10] ghostsofcarcosa: I want nose lizards
[0:21:10] Ahoy_NATO: lmao I'd never heard of a Vespa until LUCA
[0:21:14] gedeff: the book of boba fet its nowhere near being great. breaking bad is GREAT, boba fet is ok-ish
[0:21:29] WDForty: my only complaint about ep 3 was that the sfx about the speed wasn't done very well
[0:21:32] SlipCrit: @MrWeedoz PLEASE tell me they blame that on disney and not the fact that even lucas did that KEKW
[0:21:38] MaStAmUd: BIG TRUE
[0:21:45] breadgravy: Yes. Especially Mando season 1 was 100% a western and I loved it.
[0:21:45] Thrishmal: I can see that
[0:21:45] PoisonousTaoist: I wish they would have done the flashback stuff in the first 3 episodes. that's been my only gripe
[0:21:51] InternetPlumber: digging the space westerns in boba and mando
[0:21:51] NoorElBahrain: Star Wars is space westerns though
[0:21:53] Scientist__: if i like the mandalorian , should i watch this too ?
[0:21:53] hulskiey: what sane non american person likes westerns? D:
[0:21:54] pc2400: Space mafia western
[0:21:55] Jormunduur: My only issue with the Vespas, is that they are the brightest thing in the entire Star Wars Universe, the color felt a little out of place in brightness
[0:21:56] canhan81: its just a let down after the end of the mandolorin
[0:22:01] PchelaPchela: love westerns, don't care much about SW
[0:22:01] ItsNoxid: yes
[0:22:02] AnthonyPafos: I don't like westerns but i love boba fett
[0:22:06] Viriskali15: I guess I just don't understand why we need both Mando and Boba Fett, they seem too similar.
[0:22:09] WDForty: that's funny cause Star Wars is a sci-fi fantasy western ijpKEK
[0:22:11] ronrab1: I love westerns with bright blue and pink scooters, JP.
[0:22:13] K_oi: Do you need to watch mandelorian first?
[0:22:15] PlaguesV2: I agree with @anthonypafos
[0:22:15] Devlind: Have you seen Peacemaker yet? its pretty good
[0:22:19] thecynicalshuffler: prob is that boba is not really a badass in this show..  its more like the fennac shand show...  personal opinion
[0:22:19] bansheehero: I think if you like Mando you will like Fatty Boba, just finish S2 first :)
[0:22:21] m3rcer: @K_oi no
[0:22:25] ItsNoxid: u do need to watch mando first
[0:22:25] Bob__Z: Its not as grand of a scope as Mandalirian
[0:22:26] Cixah: western as in spaghetti western?
[0:22:28] Truder2k: the Vespa gang was a bit weird and the chase looked awfully slow and the CGI was not well done... other than that I enjoyed the other episodes
[0:22:30] Julia: im watching that and ozark season 4 danJulia
[0:22:39] Viriskali15: new season of Ozark was good
[0:22:40] ghostsofcarcosa: Oh yea Ozark final season
[0:22:43] NinjaPandaEU: I don't like traditional westerns, but I love sci-fi westerns. Mandalorian & Boba Fett are great.
[0:22:52] ArKiTroN: seen peacemaker?
[0:22:55] pc2400: @Viriskali15 its like mcu tv shows
[0:23:03] CarcosanStag: Ozark stresses me out and depresses the shit out of me
[0:23:05] Devlind: Ozark is pretty good with the last season, but its a show I think should have ended a few seasons ago.
[0:23:09] freaker286: Euphora is like that for me, it literally makes me sweat when watching it
[0:23:09] ghostsofcarcosa: Oh yea man its to much for that
[0:23:11] bubblebruise: @Julia im still on S1 is it worth sticking with?
[0:23:12] lillwalle: lillwalle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! what a year

[0:23:23] CarcosanStag: Started Season 4 and realized I was very unhappy lol
[0:23:23] k0jak: that show would be the like mainstream show if it was on cable
[0:23:27] ghostsofcarcosa: I watch to escape my anxiet thank you very much
[0:23:29] cjk83: I don't know if you've got this in America but give "The Bodyguard" TV series a watch. Really good action drama
[0:23:31] HokiHoshi: and this is why i watch the great british baking show
[0:23:34] SlipCrit: stress to escape stress Hmm
[0:23:35] Moohirim: i watched season 2 of dota, it was good to get some more selemene in my life
[0:23:37] Viriskali15: @stalker2400 I disagree, the MCU shows thus far have been meaningfully different from one another. Mando and Boba fulfill very similar character archetypes
[0:23:50] altizar: I like the great british baking show
[0:23:51] slickwattle: peacemaker is great!
[0:23:52] Julia: i watched that and hannibal too, no wonder im stressed out

[0:24:07] Darkaros: I need to watch S2 of Dota. I walked into a watch-along late and the Dota commentary / in-jokes were a great nostalgia trip LUL
[0:24:10] shadowoflight_: also wasn't there this monkey thing
[0:24:11] SlipCrit: OOOO
[0:24:13] scooterjr37: Peace maker is great so ridiculous abs over the top
[0:24:20] countmarcula: It's pretty meh imo
[0:24:33] BlazeRom: Sadge
[0:24:40] NoorElBahrain: Creater of Downton Abbey has a new series called The Gilded Age @itmeJP

[0:24:45] BlazeRom: we'll a f2p nft boba fett game

[0:24:53] NoorElBahrain: yes
[0:24:54] ghostsofcarcosa: @NoorElBahrain I've watched a bit its pretty good
[0:24:56] Draknios: I think they'll 100% make a bounty hunter game after the success of The Mandalorian
[0:24:59] Sir_Myrmidon: bounty hunter open world RPG seems like a no-brainer
[0:24:59] thrillhouse451: My mom loves it

[0:25:12] leovic1: gilded age has carrie coon
[0:25:13] pc2400: @Draknios would love if its canon too
[0:25:13] NinjaPandaEU: Or Massive Entertainment. Their game is supposed to be open world iirc.
[0:25:17] altizar: I'm looking forward to watching vox machina tht's coming out tommorrow
[0:25:19] BlazeRom: @Viriskali15 yeah, it is pretty short, most people were more hyped about the 60fps patch and the multiplayer content when that came out
[0:25:31] Viriskali15: @blazerom ah fair
[0:25:31] Draknios: @Stalker2400 I believe anything made now is considered canon
[0:25:33] thrillhouse451: The Jango Fett game was pretty good
[0:25:34] k0jak: can they remaster republic commando tho

[0:26:31] personno4: this supposed to be a pretty big league announcement isnt it?
[0:26:42] Julia: i binged hannibal, it gave me nightmares

[0:42:59] cjk83: Are you playing anything besides LoL offstream at the moment? Just curious if you've gone back and replayed anything away from Stream and can recommend it.
[0:42:59] Julia: so in a way he is your child now

[0:45:20] Reijm11: @Narnun new region and story reveal
[0:45:21] crawds: cant even upgrade to win11
[0:45:28] bansheehero: @craftyyydoggg 11gern discounted can get good, but yeah you got a better CPU :)
[0:45:31] WDForty: if you want a bottleneck, my 3070 is super bottlenecked by my 4770k, but good parts are stupid difficult to source for a new PC right now
[0:45:31] Inoyu: currently runnin the 10900kf
[0:45:32] Narnun: @Reijm11 oh so it's a big DLC reveal
[0:45:45] Ahoy_NATO: my new PC is 3070 with 10900KF
[0:45:46] andaroo: If you have an ASUS motherboard, Windows 11 is a piece of cake
[0:45:53] frankhard13: i who even carer
[0:45:57] ThemDemo: Pog
[0:45:58] SZebra: Oh yeah

[0:46:05] NoorElBahrain: ijpCLAP Clap
[0:46:06] Joitch: Ye
[0:46:06] Senpai_Eeyore: your computer should be able to upgrade to W11. if you have a modern motherboard
[0:46:08] thanh_n2004: heck yea
[0:46:08] Bertshet: You can since all current intel cpus can turn on tpm
[0:46:09] Monchenjiners23: yea
[0:46:11] Ebra: PauseChamp
[0:46:11] SZebra: Yeah!
[0:46:11] ThemDemo: ijpNODDERS

[0:46:25] andaroo: ASUS ROG type motherboards don't have the slowdown issue with Win11
[0:46:26] Shivverin: For Christmas?
[0:46:26] bansheehero: 11 just needs the TPM you should be able to enable it in bios. Not that it is worth it. The main benefit for W11 at the moment is HDR.
[0:46:38] Narnun: ASUS ROG is expensive though
[0:46:40] Narnun: aren't they?
[0:46:44] SZebra: @MapleMooseGamer If it's a 9900K they TPM will definitely be available as a BIOS option, yep :)
[0:46:46] Vanutappi: Have they released when PoE2 comes out?
[0:46:47] andaroo: @Narnun nah they are super common
[0:46:53] Senpai_Eeyore: I really like W11 look. its not reinventing the wheel but I like it
[0:47:01] crawds: im gonna try to grab a founder edition 4080 the day the show up
[0:47:06] DaMapleMoose: I"m on a ROG board. I didn't notice any slowdown. and Ya, I have a 9900k and that's where I got mine
[0:47:09] Kaleith: CrungoCycle loading CrungoCycle
[0:47:13] andaroo: W11 is just Windows 10.0.2 so it is the same base OS
[0:47:27] SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES: I hated the centered start menu and switched it back, but then I realized when I have my work laptop open it hides that part of the taskbar so I put em back to center LUL

[0:47:50] Archon86: HI ALL

[0:48:17] Senpai_Eeyore: @andaroo yeah I just don't really know if they need to reinvent much part W10 unless they are really gaining something from changing it completely
[0:48:19] DaMapleMoose: @Monkeytrickz not with a 1070 I'm not, lol
[0:48:19] Ebra: @DerfOnTurf not enough rgb

[0:48:28] Miros__: I'm a big fan of the corsair 680 crystal case
[0:48:32] Vorsith: @itmejp ever think about having viewers send in video feeds of themselves so you can have a live audience?
[0:48:35] Gnomeleader213: how did you find one?

[0:48:52] Archon86: is cohh joining?
[0:48:53] larkhill: 1937 is mrsp atm
[0:48:56] Sedge1987: @itmejp why did Ken get a PC? looks great
[0:48:58] andaroo: @Senpai_Eeyore agree, for short term it doesn't matter, long term maybe 2-3 years probably will start to shift
[0:49:00] Darkaros: peepoLeave 🚿
[0:49:03] StreamBonker: that would be a huge risk KEKW
[0:49:04] SZebra: EVGA often have 3090's available, it's the cards lower in the range that are difficult to find.

[0:58:44] BarryCarlyon: Might tweak the font size down a little on the title
[0:58:55] StreamBonker: @itmeJP what about doing it as an extension so that people can move it around if they want?
[0:58:57] DD_The_Shmey: that's a bunch
[0:59:08] crawds: is this orange guy a theme emote or the new mascot?
[0:59:09] ghostsofcarcosa: Yea had 1.5 but lost a bunch in bets

[1:00:14] Sonatta: ijpHMM a lot of people not playing PoE
[1:00:14] ghostsofcarcosa: These new things for polls and predictions are super cool Barry
[1:00:35] Shoaron: I think the emote should be in the box or outside the box not half n half
[1:00:36] Ozcro: they announced poe 2 way too soon
[1:00:39] UnboundSouls: i mean runescape league came out, and Lost Ark is is coming out 4 days after ppoe
[1:00:40] BlazeRom: too many things in Feb
[1:00:41] ThemDemo: I've never played POE
[1:00:42] avalanchea_: same for notifications on the right. needs an outline on yellow text
[1:00:43] DD_The_Shmey: Barry is really good at doing the Cool things
[1:00:44] Reijm11: POE burnout has been real for me
[1:00:46] BarryCarlyon: Will ad some outline :-D
[1:00:48] Doomwyte: imagine playing POE when lost arc is going to be out KEKW
[1:00:49] larkhill: lost ark definitely cuts into a lot of peoples poe time
[1:00:51] cjk83: What was the old betting system that was integrated with Justin.tv called again?
[1:00:51] ghostsofcarcosa: Feb is stacked plus I havne't played in a good long while

[1:00:56] TheodenArratay: its a big month, i dont blame em
[1:00:58] Marenthyu: @ghostsofcarcosa yes, barry does a lot of cool things
[1:00:59] andaroo: they really need POE2, badly
[1:01:00] geonoxes: Made it back with chips and soda just in time!
[1:01:01] Zairez77: i think this will be the first time i haven't played a new league in like 5 years
[1:01:04] Scojan: 100%
[1:01:05] UnboundSouls: Yup
[1:01:05] buttersnaps: thats what im doing
[1:01:07] Miklagard: I'm to hyped for ohhhhh....elden ring, so I replay at least DS3 again
[1:01:07] ghostsofcarcosa: @Marenthyu Truth
[1:01:09] saltseal: I am sooo Burned out of poe
[1:01:15] WDForty: i could see Lost Ark being an easy pivot for POE palyers
[1:01:17] poldy_: I'm kinda interested in the new lore, but thats it rooBlank
[1:01:19] Gat0rCh0mp: Yeah ill be playing 4 days of PoE and then all in on Lost Ark
[1:01:21] Lazarenth: look at all those Nos, GGG should be paying JP to stream this
[1:01:23] Ofrito: im still on the maybe
[1:01:24] avalanchea_: Lost ark is region locked, so I'm not playing it lol. I don't want to play on the japanese servers
[1:01:26] Miklagard: instead of poe
[1:01:27] OfficialJColt: It was either PoE or Destiny 2 for me this month. I chose D2
[1:01:28] IDominusI: Yeah money is a great motivator
[1:01:28] personno4: i just need a break from PoE, bit burnt out
[1:01:34] UnboundSouls: i know Ziz is gonna play the first week or so
[1:01:34] Digitking: I think GGG really screwed up by delaying the league to beginning of February. Lost Ark, Elden Ring, TWW3, etc. Lots of competition!
[1:01:35] afterlanterns: is there a release for PoE 2 yet?
[1:01:37] geonoxes: I do think the PoE burnout is real for some folks, its a lot league after league
[1:01:37] Ofrito: prob not on the start
[1:01:41] larkhill: lost ark throwing money at poe steamers sounds like a good idea
[1:01:46] Scytian: I'm waiting for POE 2, I don't care about POE 1 anymore, I hate playing every single second of current story
[1:01:50] UnboundSouls: im not sure how much content is in Lost Ark though
[1:01:54] Lazarenth: the 3.15 nerfening really killed POE for me personally
[1:01:58] Scojan: POE is a game I play on league day and then quit a day or 2 later
[1:02:00] Lazarenth: mana problems just arent fun
[1:02:03] Pewlitzer: Lost Ark is one reason for me, but PoE has gotten stale for me unfortunately
[1:02:04] Averagejoe007: I imagine GGG will figure something out to compete in terms of sponsoring streamers
[1:02:04] 14neo: well, to be fair chat - the prediction is probably skewed since people voting 'No' who may not have played before, or aren't big on it monkaHmm
[1:02:07] TheodenArratay: i will always check out the update, even if only for a week
[1:02:09] 14neo: *the vote
[1:02:11] crawds: i tried to do delirium event but it wasnt fun at all
[1:02:11] IToldYouItsTaken: i am also burned out on POE, hoping lost ark does a good job filling that void
[1:02:12] Deathkanigit101: i thought you skipped blight.
[1:02:14] Scojan: Lost Ark will have tons
[1:02:16] IraqiWizard: LUL
[1:02:16] WDForty: @UnboundSouls apparently there's 2 expansions coming with the English release
[1:02:17] imobaka: poe hit its peak a while ago, it always manages to drag ppl in again, but for shorter periods
[1:02:18] ThemDemo: ijpKEK
[1:02:23] Skyform: a fuck ton of content to go at your own pace
[1:02:28] Insigmada: Hi jp, mods and chat ijpBOOP

[1:02:36] NoorElBahrain: @Insigmada ijpHI

[1:02:38] GrannySith: I hope it won't be possible to rush past T1 and T2.
[1:02:38] BaldurCZ: i will play Lost Ark at slow pace just to enjoy and try something new, interested how it is
[1:02:39] ghostsofcarcosa: @Insigmada ijpBOOP
[1:02:40] thanh_n2004: is chat makin a guild in lost ark?
[1:02:40] crawds: lost ark raiding is similar to ff14 with all the dodging
[1:02:41] 14neo: @Insigmada ijpHI
[1:02:44] Shoaron: Lost Ark has been out for a few years now so there's plenty of content
[1:02:44] Nourack: crying for sponsor ?? LUL
[1:02:44] JBfromAccounting: I'll be playing a bit in-between the big releases I'm thinking. just depends on what the end game is with this update
[1:02:47] GameOnlyNoTalk: All the content lol people are literally crying because they are releasing too much content.
[1:02:47] BlazeRom: Jesus
[1:02:49] Ahoy_NATO: it takes like 16-20 hours to hit max level in Lost Ark, and then end game starts and it's huge
[1:02:49] DingoOnMy40: Indeed it’s not like the game been out anywhere else
[1:02:50] greedo626: Since they showed PoE2 I just can't excited for leagues ijpSHRUG

[1:03:04] larkhill: its an little overwhelming amount of content but im hoping its gated in some way that makes it make sense as i progress
[1:03:05] xence: that's like what, 300ish hours?
[1:03:09] BlazeRom: watch some people still do all that content in one week
[1:03:12] 14neo: i can understand it being HeavensWard and StormBlood quantities - but Shadowbringers too? D:
[1:03:13] Bigbaby1927: mmmm
[1:03:19] XitalicaX: now imagine if arr released with all of that but it was all the same quality as arr... oof
[1:03:19] Skyform: the director of Lost Ark wants NA/EU to catch up at a relatively fast pace
[1:03:21] avalanchea_: thats like 300 hours lol. there is no way, is there?
[1:03:23] ProSkilz58: is lost ark completely free to play or is it upto a level?
[1:03:26] BarryCarlyon: doogCLAPPING
[1:03:31] roguebullets: its called, 'old game'
[1:03:36] MostlyHype: did we decide on a class for lost ark?

[1:03:39] WDForty: @UnboundSouls Lost Ark isn't a "new" game, it's been out for 5 years in Korea and the English release is going to be close to that version
[1:03:40] poldy_: hypeE 1 minute
[1:03:41] Ozcro: ptr's are a curse and a blessing

[1:39:26] The_Faceless_Void: @ZombiesR no new skills to me is okay. Adding QOL stuff and fixing things is better to me like the atlas map and stones
[1:39:27] LarsHJensen: @Norrak1 was here from start, its only 35% complete now
[1:39:31] SlipCrit: simple to a galaxy brain maybe

[1:40:00] IraqiWizard: yeah i love POE but im not playing it after Elden Ring comes out
[1:40:01] Ignisgladius: I think this league is mainly about atlas rekowr rather than the league mechanic itself

[1:40:30] Nemoir: I think the endgame changes are massive aside from league soo, that covers it
[1:40:31] dragonbotherer: @dragonbotherer hehe, it didn't remain that way, that's for sure!
[1:40:31] darkrhulad: yep, I don't have enough time to play to get to true end game

[1:41:47] Azegoroth: I mean, the good part about the main part of this being an atlas update is that you will nave new stuff even if you don't play until next league
[1:41:53] MrWeedoz: it'd be great if SSF could be offline in poe

[1:49:23] Angelpawz: less rng tho i think
[1:49:24] CatatonicKiwi: it's a grind, but it's super front loaded
[1:49:27] Ravenwings4: the will be a grind, but you have a lot more points frontloaded
[1:49:29] Juksrace: completionist route
[1:49:29] Boshean: honestly the Poe campaign sucks
[1:49:34] R3nZiO: good thing its simple
[1:49:35] Tr0nc3k: ARGH!!!
[1:49:37] GameOnlyNoTalk: its is a litte grind but i dont mind the grind as much aas i hated playing with the stupid watch stones
[1:49:39] TheodenArratay: this is a much better system though, because the best passives were locked behind the hidden relms\
[1:49:51] Proph89: I'm glad it's sounding front loaded instead of this literally taking forever to get half of this "juice"
[1:49:53] jaypretorius: ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE
[1:49:58] Senpai_Eeyore: the acts completely keep me from playing PoE it takes me 20 hours to get through them and then I am bored by the time I get to maps. I am slow and the completionist in me wont let me run through mobs
[1:50:04] Juksrace: orb of corn flakes??
[1:50:05] Miros__: lul
[1:50:06] iskaiperino: but all the best stuff we'll probably go for early so the last points are optional
[1:50:09] SlipCrit: kinda crazy this game has been essentially replayign the same campaign for 10 years ?

[2:02:33] TheodenArratay: @neinvox yeah my advice would be to find a skill (probably a few) you wanna play, then look up a guide for that skill and have fun dayHeart

[2:04:04] JBfromAccounting: @neinvox maybe a little, in that you've played an action RPG before but that's about it
[2:04:10] The_Faceless_Void: @neinvox I would saying going from diablo to POE is likg middle school to highschool kinda of a big leap for ppl
[2:04:12] Scientist__: @neinvox D3 or D2, D2 exp should help a bit
[2:04:40] BirdReligion: there is a metal band named arch nemesis... but they broke up after 2 albums?
[2:04:41] k0jak: there's an edm producer that goes by archnemesis
[2:04:42] neinvox: @Scientist__  both!
[2:04:48] The_Faceless_Void: @neinvox or maybe high school to college the training wheels come off and you hav to venture on your own andhop things go well
[2:04:50] personno4: the recipes might get a bit complicated for it tho
[2:04:51] Dorwen: those implicit orbs can't be used on influenced items right=
