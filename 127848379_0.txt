[4:04:19] Donnie64: True true people would dodge so much more often with 5 bans but it'd be nice
[4:04:35] FishRoeSoup: they should make 5 bans for diamond+ like they force diamond+ to duo q only last year
[4:05:00] fudleh: then you would spend 10 mins in champ select just for someone to dodge. then another 10 mins before you even get threw another champ select

[5:58:32] heikeith: I sit at the middle TriHard
[5:58:36] yz_pingo: WHY THEY ARE NOT PLAYING?
[5:58:37] iworshipfaker: y is guy on right...not in school
[5:58:38] Kingkeflex: 1-1
[5:58:40] TheTragicomical: @FeetnGun, I disagree! I think it helps he's been around for a LONG time, he's also easy to listen to so that helps
[5:58:41] dindu_nufin_TriHard: ResidentSleeper LPL doesnt have ads they can just throw to us ? ResidentSleeper pls stop the random talking ResidentSleeper and put some chinese ads FeelsAmazingMan
[5:58:47] Mongobeef: @Crimson57o, I doubt she regrets it. It is a decent tattoo
[5:58:49] TheTragicomical: @FeetnGun Charisma is important too
[5:58:52] huseyin290399: so they'll play the 3rd game today`
[5:59:02] Crimson57o: @mongobeef it's not a decent tattoo
[5:59:03] yz_pingo: Someone can respond me why THEY are not PLAYING?

[5:59:11] dindu_nufin_TriHard: MrDJPingo, remake
[5:59:13] Kingkeflex: they are on remake
[5:59:15] iworshipfaker: @TheTragicomical Lol tryna tell me dash knows anything about league...you ever actually listened to him analyze why a team won
[5:59:18] Crimson57o: It's decent if it was somewhere normal. That's just a bad neck tattoo
[5:59:20] yz_pingo: bug or smth?
[5:59:23] huseyin290399: I've bet on Omg
[5:59:29] huseyin290399: i hope they'll win
[5:59:29] Crimson57o: And a neck tattoo alone is already ***
[5:59:30] iworshipfaker: @TheTragicomical very charismatic though I agree

[6:00:14] Mongobeef: @Crimson57o, that's an opinion an not a fact. It isn't a garbage tattoo. That you don't like it or the placement doesn't make that an objective fact
[6:00:15] TheTragicomical: @FeetnGun Well obviously he's on the panel for a reason. He's not the greatest with calling back to previous games like Fros, but he can carry a break
[6:00:28] lealkid: Ty @kingkeflex
[6:00:31] Kingkeflex: OMG!!!
[6:00:34] Mongobeef: The worst caster in this is Pulse
