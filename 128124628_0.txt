[2:20:17] BornAndDoom: @BuddyLoxX mouth watering :D
[2:20:26] TheTragicomical: It's most likely moonshine or grog, it's probably a wine due to its color. But I know he uses true ice to brew it.
[2:20:30] weakestlink99: *watching
[2:20:32] BuddyLoxX: butcherburgers, temperature?
[2:20:37] TheTragicomical: Y'know, Lissandra's powers and Trundle's club

[2:21:57] weakestlink99: Irelia is always nerfed.
[2:22:11] TheTragicomical: Ask what Swain's bird's name is. I know the answer to that one too. I'm one of the 5 people that gives a damn about League lore
[2:22:19] BornAndDoom: @BuddyLoxX medium rare :D

[2:23:27] TheTragicomical: And also Leblanc. J4 is Leblanc. It's true. Kappa
[2:23:37] TheTragicomical: I was alt-tabbed. Damn.
[2:23:41] Blameobama88: !score
[2:23:47] cantspeel: True or False Dodge used to be a stat found on items. Dodge worked like crit, that it had a chance of proccing and it could be stacked up to 100%.
[2:23:49] BornAndDoom: Riot knew the problem but they not fixing , they want more fund from their investor :D
[2:23:54] TheTragicomical: True
[2:23:59] talnova: LOL
[2:24:02] EES4: false

[2:24:06] BizarreKoopa: False
[2:24:10] GrappleMans: Man, I miss those days
[2:24:10] PulseIRL: @cantspeel Jax DansGame

[2:24:21] TheTragicomical: Nah. Dodge used to be the stat on Tabis
[2:24:23] cantspeel: :)
[2:24:25] cantspeel: :)
[2:24:32] PulseIRL: @cantspeel BibleThump
[2:24:46] TheTragicomical: Then changed it to armor and basic attack reduction when they removed dodge. I wanna work at riot so I did my research.
[2:24:51] cantspeel: True or False, Pulse is a one trick Quinn Top
[2:24:52] TheTragicomical: #fiteme
[2:24:55] Ozirizz: my boots of swiftness give me 100% dodge to varus ult Kappa
[2:24:59] TheTragicomical: True Kappa
[2:25:01] weakestlink99: True
[2:25:07] TheTragicomical: I'll ask one.
[2:25:17] TheTragicomical: What's the name of Nunu's best friend?
[2:25:19] bazookashs: @RiotPulse can you confirm that Vedius inherited his ears from his father, Prince Charles?
[2:25:22] PulseIRL: False, I'm a two trick MF/Quinn Kappa
[2:25:25] BuddyLoxX: Willump
[2:25:28] weakestlink99: #pulseisaonetrick
[2:25:30] TheTragicomical: Buddy has it.
[2:25:36] cantspeel: the answer was indeed False, Pulse flexes to his other one trick MF
[2:26:00] TheTragicomical: Next one. What makes a yordle go evil?
[2:26:00] BuddyLoxX: RiotPulse, MF Top PogChamp
[2:26:09] TheTragicomical: You'll never get this one. I'll give you a hint. Veigar lore.
[2:26:20] TheTragicomical: Hire me, Riot. I write. :(
[2:26:33] BuddyLoxX: Dark and mysterious Kappa
[2:26:41] TheTragicomical: I'll give ya' a bit.
[2:27:00] TheTragicomical: (It's lack of social interaction, it drives Yordles insane and Veigar went bonkers in prison.)
[2:27:02] weakestlink99: Has the pause time hit 0 yet?
[2:27:18] BizarreKoopa: 4:30 AM in NA
[2:27:21] BornAndDoom: this is going to be long , may be dragging till midnight
[2:27:41] TheTragicomical: 3:30 AM here in the ol EST, so I'll be here asking trivia that I think people might not know the answer to
[2:27:57] really_ryn: Isnt it 4:30? Daylight savings time
[2:28:03] SharpMaN7: legit 0-0 whats going on?
[2:28:04] hanafinit: 4:30 yup
[2:28:17] weakestlink99: Where in Shanghai is this filmed?
[2:28:33] TheTragicomical: Lulu and a certain other champion have a possible connection. Who is it? Hint: It's a song.
[2:28:41] TheTragicomical: vineClown
[2:28:47] weakestlink99: I don't know, so I'm asking.
[2:28:49] talnova: First Time a game was canceled cause of Champion Bugs AMAZING
[2:28:56] talnova: not really
[2:28:59] YOLOallRARES: score ?
[2:29:02] talnova: RIOT covers up this *** all the time

[2:29:35] weakestlink99: Tristana?
[2:29:36] TheTragicomical: Another hour long delay because someone forgot a mastery they're gonna end up using anyway
[2:29:41] talnova: MOVE ALONG
[2:29:43] FishRoeSoup: 1 AND A HALF HOUR AND NOW THIS ? IEM ???? Jebaited

[2:30:00] talnova: Sorry Kids this is Riot you didn't see anything okay
[2:30:01] TheTragicomical: The answer was Shaco FeelsBadMan
[2:30:09] ayakashi_kan: o
[2:30:32] TheTragicomical: Name three champions whose backstories need to be rewritten due to the removal of the League of Legends and summoners in lore.
[2:30:39] TheTragicomical: Kappa
[2:30:39] talnova: Riot You didn't see any Champion bugs which resulted in a game not counting. Nope that was just a test.. don't worry
[2:30:43] BornAndDoom: imagine this year worlds final hold in China , pause after pause :D
[2:30:55] ayakashi_kan: uh
[2:30:55] ebuCCC: RIP LGD
[2:30:59] talnova: well imagine if they just left in the middle of the game
[2:31:10] talnova: LOL
[2:31:18] talnova: DUDES IT IS EASY IT WAS A BUG!!!!
[2:31:36] talnova: Champions have bugs and break the game Zzzzzzz
[2:31:49] TheTragicomical: FeelsBadMan Nocturne, Alistar, Brand, and Fiddlesticks
[2:32:09] cavalRy7: LEAGUE OF BUGS NotLikeThis
[2:32:17] Press_X_ToJASON: @butcherburgers, bugs have never happened in EU or NA Kappa

[2:32:55] weakestlink99: have fun @thetragicomical
[2:33:31] cavalRy7: ALL IM SAYIN TriHard
[2:33:45] TheTragicomical: @weakestlink99 FeelsBadMan Annie's parents are rogue wizards. FeelsBadMan
[2:33:59] Crimson57o: Finally they fired that lesbian
[2:34:11] ssg2k: guys
[2:34:16] BornAndDoom: the casters FeelsBadMan
[2:34:22] ssg2k: wtf they are waiting
[2:34:23] innu2919: HeyGuys
[2:34:23] Osteoid: ResidentSleeper
[2:34:30] SharpMaN7: so are they gonna have vitality remake?
[2:34:31] cavalRy7: Crimson57o Pulse? Kappa
[2:34:31] TheTragicomical: I think she's just taking a break, probably getting another tattoo to make people in chat mad for little reason
[2:34:42] weakestlink99: I wonder if anyone knows where this is filmed, because I don't.
[2:34:53] TheTragicomical: @weakestlink99 I think it might be Australia, iirc
[2:34:53] Rawrsong: Must be hard for Rahz to find a barbershop in China
[2:34:54] weakestlink99: Maybe some mall?
[2:35:04] TheTragicomical: Nah. I heard it's the ol' Land Down Under.
[2:35:07] ssg2k: WHY THEY ARE WAİTİNG
[2:35:25] cavalRy7: NO CHRONOSHIFT IN CHINA?
[2:35:37] TheTragicomical: These guys are just casting feed from China. Buuut... Yeah. I'm tempted to say Melbourne?
[2:35:47] weakestlink99: Not the studio sections, but the feed.
[2:35:56] BornAndDoom: she will tattoo on other side of neck :D
[2:36:03] varusXzyra: TriHard TheRinger DendiFace
[2:36:11] cantspeel: How would everyone feel about an AMA for our caster desk?
[2:36:12] TheTragicomical: The feed itself is... Hm. @butcherburgers I really hope so, I love seeing people in chat get grossed out over nothing
[2:36:17] innu2919: 4Head
[2:36:20] TheTragicomical: It's hilarious! EleGiggle
[2:36:25] ssg2k: MATCH POSTPONED?
[2:36:25] weakestlink99: Ok
[2:36:38] TheTragicomical: Dunno about the stadium the feed is coming from, unfortunately.
[2:36:56] TheTragicomical: my knowledge is mostly all useless facts about every dimple on a champion's asscheeks FeelsBadMan
[2:37:10] BornAndDoom: @TheTragicomical our chat room more interesting than casters :D
[2:37:21] cavalRy7: Cantspeel is there chronoshift in CN? Or they're just gonna make full remake?
[2:37:35] ssg2k: guys answer pls why match stopped
[2:37:37] cantspeel: Youll have an update on that from Dom
[2:37:38] TheTragicomical: Most of the time, only because it's so slow. You can actually chat. It's bizarre. Shame LPL is on a two day delay streak.
[2:37:49] cantspeel: Also there is a full post on chronobreak that you can find on why it's specifcially in NA
[2:38:00] TheTragicomical: @cantspeel Which stadium is the feed from? Weakest is curious.
[2:38:13] weakestlink99: Yeah, there isn't much spam here.
[2:38:24] cantspeel: Shanghai Arena in CN
[2:38:25] BornAndDoom: LPL always behind than others
[2:38:31] TheTragicomical: Thank you bb
[2:38:33] weakestlink99: ty @cantspeel
[2:38:43] Optyfenx: REMAKE
[2:38:44] BizarreKoopa: :(
[2:38:47] hanafinit: REMAKE
[2:38:51] TheTragicomical: I'll continue giving dumb trivia. Braum's shield is actually a door. He ripped it out to save a baby troll.
[2:38:54] weakestlink99: Remake
[2:39:07] cavalRy7: WE'RE LOSING REMAKE BabyRage
[2:39:07] TheTragicomical: WutFace Oh god damn it.
[2:39:35] TheTragicomical: Tibbers is actually an enslaved Shadow Bear, cursed to an eternity of serving a prodigal little girl who likes burning things
[2:39:43] TheTragicomical: Also Annie is horrifying
[2:40:16] ayakashi_kan: this is depressing
[2:40:30] cavalRy7: *** THESE REMAKES AND DELAYS
[2:40:32] cantspeel: if anybody has any questions for our casters , let us know!
[2:40:39] TheTragicomical: Dunno if her lore is the same though. The Institute of War being removed and all
[2:40:49] TheTragicomical: @cantspeel Ask them where Lord Fros is.
[2:40:53] Kingkeflex: whos playing
[2:40:55] cantspeel: Day off hah
[2:41:00] Kingkeflex: we
[2:41:01] TheTragicomical: I'm getting bored and need color to look at. God damn it.
[2:41:19] TheTragicomical: Fros bb I miss you, you and your punk hair colors. BibleThump Calll meeeee
[2:41:21] ayakashi_kan: ftnaGUN ftnaBAD tbh if it wasnt for them losing the fight would they have pointed out the skill or whatever not going through
[2:41:35] BornAndDoom: LPL sound very soft , can't hear casters clearly. LCK LSM sound louder than LPL
[2:41:44] TheTragicomical: Anyway. Trundle originally suffered from leprosy, but his regeneration made any skin that sloshed off restore rather quickly. He took on a curse for his tribe.
[2:41:52] TheTragicomical: Like actual slushy flesh, falling off.
[2:42:01] TheTragicomical: Pretty tasty.
[2:42:30] TheTragicomical: Willump killed a dude for Nunu. Like ate him. And also sheltered him from the cold like he was a Charmander.
[2:42:30] EES4: i have forgotten about the game we were watching
[2:42:37] TRUTHS33K3R: HeyGuys
[2:42:39] TheTragicomical: yeah just talk about nonsense really, it's easier
[2:42:42] cavalRy7: LGD gonna get tilted and lose now NotLikeThis
[2:43:04] Silv3rStr3ak: @TheTragicomical Are these real lore facts, or are you making these up? Either way, well done, entertaining haha
[2:43:05] ayakashi_kan: im tilted
[2:43:12] TheTragicomical: @Silv3rStr3ak They're legit.
[2:43:28] PulseIRL: They're not all canon any more but they were legit lore once upon a time
[2:43:32] TheTragicomical: the Journals of Justice used to showcase lore events before Riot ruined everything and made all events playable
[2:43:40] weakestlink99: Anyone else like the show formerly known as Fei Cheng Wu Rao?
[2:43:42] TheTragicomical: (Yes. But Nunu's is still legit still.)
[2:43:58] TheTragicomical: For instance, before the great retconning,- Tragically? PogChamp
[2:44:01] ayakashi_kan: ResidentSleeper
[2:44:15] TheTragicomical: Anyway. Before the retcon, there was an arch revolving around Swain becoming high commander of Noxus, hence his swagtastic skin.
[2:44:19] cantspeel: Ok i got a question for pulse
[2:44:19] PulseIRL: I mean technically Summoners don't exist but still exist
[2:44:29] cantspeel: are you above or below cantspeel in LP XD
[2:44:31] BornAndDoom: LGD won't loose , they have to win otherwise Coach force them to walk home :D
[2:44:36] TheTragicomical: Nah they don't exist anymore. Summoner spells should be changed in name
[2:44:45] TheTragicomical: Kappa
[2:44:52] cavalRy7: Wtf siri on my phone just got activated from casters
[2:44:56] derr3ck: 0-0?
[2:45:00] TheTragicomical: Like they're not a thing. The league isn't a thing. Brand, Nocturne, Alistar, and Fiddlesticks are homeless.
[2:45:01] PulseIRL: @cantspeel I would have to log in but last time I checked like half a week ago I'd overtaken you
[2:45:11] TheTragicomical: Institute of War is gone, so Jax's story is ***
[2:45:14] cantspeel: yes, i shot myself int he foot here... im behind
[2:45:18] TheTragicomical: Tsk tsk
[2:45:20] cantspeel: eks deezle, the doc sheezle
[2:45:29] Kingkeflex: has im we started yet
[2:45:43] TheTragicomical: Ask me lore questions, I'll probably know them. I'm rusty on the second wave of Shurima stuff though.
[2:45:56] TheTragicomical: Specifically Taliyah? I gotta go over her and Yasuo's little buddy buddy story
[2:45:59] PulseIRL: I also know a lot of dumb lore stuff
[2:46:02] ayakashi_kan: @TheTragicomical, that sounds more ruined than when bob ross adds a huge tree in his paintings, and it cant even be saved, this is riot 0 devil 1
[2:46:06] SharpMaN7: ResidentSleeper
[2:46:07] mito_k: angry vag
[2:46:09] Kingkeflex: whos playing
[2:46:14] EES4: @thetragicomical rammus ezreal interaction
[2:46:16] cantspeel: QGvsLGD
[2:46:20] cantspeel: we are remaking
[2:46:20] Kingkeflex: ???
[2:46:22] koti_911: this is so dissapointing
[2:46:33] ayakashi_kan: @OSH1N, indeed ftnaBAD
[2:46:40] TheTragicomical: @ayakashi_kan You're technically not wrong. They have a lot of backtracking to do to fix like, 90 champs
[2:46:44] koti_911: QG getting annihilated, can't deny it
[2:46:46] Kingkeflex: thank you cantspeel
[2:46:56] cantspeel: no thank you for hanging in there
[2:47:00] TheTragicomical: @EES4 Oh yeahhh. I think I remember that? Was Ezreal in a ruin and Rammus just popped up?
[2:47:09] Kingkeflex: is it 0 0 im waiting on im we
[2:47:09] TheTragicomical: That sounds like something that would happen. Him being an explorer and all
[2:47:18] EES4: @thetragicomical yeeeeee 4Head
[2:47:20] cavalRy7: Qsh1n doesn't matter if LGD tilts after stupid bug remake
[2:47:21] TheTragicomical: And an anime protag piece of trash
[2:47:28] TheTragicomical: @EES4 GOTTEM. FeelsGoodMan
[2:47:36] ayakashi_kan: @TheTragicomical, but then wouldnt they have to be careful about changing interactions and then having to fix even more champs if they bother to fix the lore and all
[2:47:40] TheTragicomical: I'm on a roll, hire me for the lore team, Riot!
[2:47:48] cantspeel: XD
[2:47:55] TheTragicomical: Yes, Ayakashi. They would. That's why removing the thing the game is named after was kind of really stupid
[2:47:57] EES4: @thetragicomical The story of Syndra (my fav)
[2:48:04] TheTragicomical: It's now just "Legends" really
[2:48:06] PulseIRL: Rammus's story was literally him just wandering for years and years but he kinda just appeared one day and wanted to know what he was
[2:48:17] mito_k: League of remakes
[2:48:20] fishuuuu: Ok
[2:48:20] TheTragicomical: Rammus is really just a waster. It's great
[2:48:40] FishRoeSoup: WTF IS GOING ON SwiftRage 2 HOURS AND STILL NOT STARTING SwiftRage IEM 2.0 SwiftRage
[2:48:44] mito_k: NOk
[2:48:46] TheTragicomical: @EES4 Also yes, absolutely. Her story can be adjusted easily by removing the league factor, her just going off to wreck ***
[2:48:49] cavalRy7: I saw a story with Zed and Syndra in it at Rule34 Kappa
[2:48:58] TheTragicomical: How dare they restrict her power, brwahwarbarwhrw
[2:49:13] TheTragicomical: I think the lore team does so much good work, but it's kind of misplaced or not put int he right Medium
[2:49:36] cantspeel: Sorry team, CN teams QG vs LGD are currently remaking due to a game bug
[2:49:38] EES4: syndra story reminds me of the story of a cartoon with a monkey ( similar to wukong)
[2:49:41] TheTragicomical: Stuff like playable cosmetic events or modes is great, but at the same time so would a single player fleshed out game of playing as Rammus rolling around at the speed of sound
[2:49:52] TheTragicomical: So many characters, so much potential.
[2:49:56] PulseIRL: The lore is being remade region by region though and the updates since Shurima have been really solid
[2:50:00] Last1Try: why map score
[2:50:03] koti_911: incompetent chinese production
[2:50:07] TheTragicomical: What do we get. FailFish yordle table top game
[2:50:30] TheTragicomical: Kappa @RiotPulse Oh yeah definitely, Shurima's was tight. I actually really like Targon's fixing
[2:50:33] ayakashi_kan: ResidentSleeper ftnaGUN ftnaBAD

[2:57:03] Robinustream: I love spaghetti
[2:57:04] TheTragicomical: Like full on hoop earrings and boobage up to 11. Beauty mark, gap between teeth. That type.
[2:57:04] TurtleMonkey1410: wait what
[2:57:11] Robinustream: especially if it's code

[3:00:15] koti_911: bc CHiNA
[3:00:16] TheTragicomical: Holy *** I spelled that right.
[3:00:19] wholemoss: LGD should deserve the win. After the second pause, LGD's minions pushed to QG's base and got the base. LOL. So they have to remake.
[3:00:22] SharpMaN7: vitality round 2

[3:01:36] Robinustream: LOL
[3:01:40] koti_911: Make DOinmb cry >:)

[3:02:09] saKrayZne: what ABOUT Vi?
[3:02:18] Robinustream: is that a new champ?
[3:02:19] TheTragicomical: Police Brutality put a ring on her finger and she said "I do." Then punched it.
[3:02:24] saKrayZne: lol
[3:02:35] TheTragicomical: Please hire me Riot. I love these champions. BibleThump
[3:02:40] Robinustream: so vi is a reference to the na police brutality? LUL
[3:02:49] TheTragicomical: Nah. Just in general. She's the bad cop.
[3:02:50] saKrayZne: only two good kinds of cops, Vi, and the ones you never see
[3:03:03] TheTragicomical: Caitlyn is the hardass who can make a joke
[3:03:11] TheTragicomical: And Jayce is a boyscout
[3:03:36] TheTragicomical: Cammile is Le Fong from Avatar. (Also I just know her lore from looking at her.)
[3:03:47] TheTragicomical: (And a bit of info. Cyborg, enhanced, catches the bad guys.)
[3:04:08] TheTragicomical: And has an ult that Riot purposefully did not put on Fiora because it was too toxic, GG Riot
[3:04:30] K1mskii: who win 1 map?
[3:04:33] TheTragicomical: The Arena nonsense. It was considered for Fiora but they scrapped it because they knew it was bad. Give it to Camille. Great.
[3:04:33] ayakashi_kan: riot ResidentSleeper

[3:06:21] DeshTheWraith: LGD was ahead
[3:06:37] weakestlink99: LGD was +6k at abandonment

[3:06:50] YOLOallRARES: lul RIP who live betting LGD then

[5:07:59] CWHarper: @Sov25, dunno man, complaining about ellipsis is pretty autistic
[5:08:10] Sov25: @cwharper thank you

[5:13:27] osklift: Where is the dive on IM?
[5:13:52] osklift: They had already picked Vlad
[5:14:02] Erymon: kled and gragas would eat a kog all day long.
[5:14:19] osklift: Not when Kog has Lulu, Karma and Lee rofl
[5:14:27] Acidrain18769: No Yordles in this meta BibleThump
[5:14:35] Acidrain18769: eh
[5:14:40] Acidrain18769: ziggs
[5:14:40] huskyterrier: isnt Kled a Yorlde?
[5:14:44] osklift: Kog has so much peel in this comp, Klad and Grag wouldn't do anything
[5:14:46] Acidrain18769: is he?
[5:14:48] huskyterrier: I guessw hes not really meta though
[5:15:11] osklift: Kled is an ancient Yordle? or is that Gnar?
[5:15:12] huskyterrier: idk actually, hes short? lol
[5:15:25] huskyterrier: yeah thats gnar
[5:15:30] Erymon: yes, they would. feel free to try that comp against a grag/kled in anything above bronze and see it for yourself.
[5:15:32] Acidrain18769: yes kled is a yordle :D
[5:15:38] Acidrain18769: thx google
[5:16:07] HakuBow: NO MANA BigBrother
[5:16:18] osklift: MFW I pick Kog every game and I am Silver 1 KappPride
[5:16:40] osklift: KappaPride KappaPride
[5:16:53] Erymon: and if you did play kog in this meta, you'd need to build him with TF first, which reduces his end game carry ability.
[5:17:00] osklift: HAHAHAH
[5:17:10] osklift: No, you go guinsoos and destroy everybody.
[5:17:17] cavalRy7: OOOH Kreygasm

[5:18:21] osklift: And Tabi/Mercs
[5:18:26] osklift: Faker
[5:18:43] osklift: or TiensiNoAkuma Kappa
[5:18:50] cavalRy7: I need it for runes and masteries. Faker doesn't care about runes
[5:19:52] osklift: check champion analytics on opgg
[5:20:04] goblinguy01: It's World Elite vs Edward Esports
[5:20:52] osklift: For real though, Kog is low key broken. Highest winrate adc, got my trashy *** to diamond
[5:21:52] osklift: Though to be fair I usually don't blind pick Kog. I def would have picked Kog in this game
[5:22:04] Acidrain18769: so is lucian viable in this patch?
[5:22:25] osklift: Yes Lucian is viable

[5:40:29] THEchanllenger: IM will win
[5:40:37] THEchanllenger: WE is lack of damage
[5:40:39] teemoyang: What did lulu did ?
[5:41:04] osklift: @THEchanllenger, I agree, they should have picked Kog instead of this Ez pick
[5:41:05] teemoyang: I haven't see Lulu go Near the Dragon
[5:41:51] xLamonteCoxX: Damn, IM is game as hell lol
[5:41:51] osklift: With Kog they could 3v5
[5:42:07] dareboy92: what Kog is actually a pick in lpl?
[5:42:08] cavalRy7: THAT CHOKE 4Head
[5:42:09] airjaw: they're losing cuz karma is useless
[5:42:29] THEchanllenger: no way they can deal with this vlad now
[5:42:43] cavalRy7: nice damage kled
[5:42:48] xLamonteCoxX: well the WE team comp does lack damage.
[5:42:49] Sonicfields: Lol Ezreal is the only damage
[5:42:49] toi3uon: 2 sup on we?
[5:43:17] toi3uon: if im stall this, they may win
[5:43:17] Sonicfields: Ezreal is a safe ad anyway hes better in high damage comps
[5:43:23] Sonicfields: its not like a jinx
[5:43:43] cavalRy7: GG
[5:43:43] lxe322: PogChamp
[5:43:44] TheFurioso: THROWS LUL
[5:43:45] xXbucXx: its like the qulifier to worlds
[5:43:50] Voltiate: Good lord
[5:43:58] osklift: The Ezreal pick is so stupid
[5:44:09] lxe322: EleGiggle
[5:44:11] osklift: Kog could just stand still and destroy the entire team.
[5:44:42] Sonicfields: PTSD from naut teleport
[5:44:42] GrimZillaH: HOW DOES IT FEEL RUSTY
[5:44:43] imay42: what a throw
[5:44:47] osklift: Kog could also get more defensive items while dealing 3x the dmg
[5:44:48] dareboy92: Kog is good guys or what?
[5:44:54] halloderbaer: RUSTY <3
[5:44:57] CJDM310: That Vlad is actually pretty fed
[5:44:57] TheFurioso: or Sivir and Jinx
[5:44:58] osklift: Kog is the highest winrate ADC for a reason
[5:44:58] Voltiate: Jinx, kog, cait, take your pick
[5:45:10] Acidrain18769: jinx?
[5:45:12] osklift: I think Cait was banned actually
[5:45:16] toi3uon: vlad is so big
[5:45:20] halloderbaer: lol 3 players of IM have 3 wards each
[5:45:22] Sonicfields: Kog is strong in soloq but in pro play he gets shafted in lane
[5:45:23] dareboy92: even in soloq?
[5:45:38] TheFurioso: Ezreal is the most absurd pick
[5:45:38] osklift: Kog is the best AD by far for SoloQ
[5:45:39] Sonicfields: in soloq people aren't good enough to punish laning phase
[5:45:53] toi3uon: it's only 35 minutes,
[5:45:58] TheFurioso: for this comp
[5:45:59] osklift: I know this because I abuse Kog
[5:46:00] Acidrain18769: kog beats varus?
[5:46:02] xLamonteCoxX: Maokai's a tank, Lee is a tank. Karma does some damage but falls off as a mage. Lulu is a support. And Ez isn't the highest damage AD ever.
[5:46:05] mlg_rusty_spoon: its not about being good enough its coordination with the rest of the team
[5:46:11] toi3uon: can we see the gold of each players please?
[5:46:14] osklift: Varus is the lowest winrate ADC in SolQ lol
[5:46:23] lxe322: I'd abuse Kog too Kreygasm
[5:46:27] teemoyang: I like game like This you can't know the end until end
[5:46:37] osklift: I abuse Kog all day Kappa
[5:46:43] Voltiate: I also hate the fact that it's Lee sin jungle. If you want on do this comp then I feel that jungle needs to be a threat
[5:47:15] osklift: They either needed a hypercarry (Kog) or a big threat out of Top (or jungle)
[5:47:15] toi3uon: just push mid
[5:47:16] xLamonteCoxX: I mean lee can be, but he just went tank lol
[5:47:25] mlg_rusty_spoon: the ez pick is alright the problem is karma does nothing and its too late for a lee sin to be relevant
[5:47:49] imay42: rly, why the fk lee goes tanky...
[5:48:09] kingkarus: 8k gold lead, can't win team fight WutFace
[5:48:13] osklift: Ezreal was picked last rotation too. That is why I am focussing on that pick
[5:48:15] GrimZillaH: eyemay win?
[5:48:22] Voltiate: I don't know what pick/ban was, but this was definitely a good game to pick know Graves for WE
[5:48:23] Sonicfields: at this stage any build on lee is useless..
[5:48:39] CJDM310: gg
[5:48:47] Dagobert2424: condi Kreygasm
[5:48:50] imay42: kill vlaad kill that mtfker!!!!
[5:49:01] osklift: Graves could be good yes
[5:49:16] osklift: Olaf would also be good
[5:49:17] dareboy92: can someone send me a viable build for kog? I used to abuse him in S6 and kinda mained him in S5 but now I dont know what to build :/
[5:49:24] lxe322: ResidentSleeper
[5:49:33] ancestortnt: 0 TOWERS LUL EleGiggle
[5:49:36] osklift: Guinsoo - hurricane - bork/wits end
[5:49:36] teemoyang: The top come late
[5:49:51] mlg_rusty_spoon: i see you with the jinx/kog picks but they're just *** in lane you don't ever get to the late game with that
[5:49:53] osklift: Get defensive boots (Tabis/Mercs/Swifties) and get a defensive item
[5:49:58] CJDM310: IM has no dragons
[5:50:01] dareboy92: thanks man
[5:50:11] TheFurioso: interesting trade
[5:50:16] osklift: And u can either run Furor or Stormraiders
[5:50:20] Sonicfields: Unless its a really coordinated duo you should be able to get through lane with kog
[5:50:28] imay42: so who is stronger... Baron Nashor or Elder Dragon!
[5:50:30] xLamonteCoxX: Baron doesn't help teamfight though.
[5:50:32] osklift: Stormraiders is good because u can get magic pen + lethality, but I think furor is better atm
[5:50:39] Voltiate: At the same time, it almost doesn't matter what adc WE picked because I'M was smart in taking the ap carry tank in vlad
[5:50:44] TheFurioso: MAOKAI BALANCED
[5:51:00] osklift: IM has 0 dmg too haha
[5:51:28] mlg_rusty_spoon: at this level of play i dont think a kog would survive a gragas gank
[5:51:49] osklift: At this level of play they should be tracking the jungler
[5:52:30] mlg_rusty_spoon: alroght and then ben4 just camps and the kog never gets any gold or exp
[5:52:37] lxe322: PogChamp
[5:52:55] TheFurioso: VLAD THINGS

[5:53:21] imay42: nerf vlaad ffs DansGame
[5:53:25] osklift: Kappa
[5:53:27] mlg_rusty_spoon: not to mention lpl teams seem to have no idea what a ward is
[5:53:32] Voltiate: Jesus this vlad is a problem. Good thing WE has map pressure
[5:53:47] osklift: This Ashe build

[5:56:30] CJDM310: only 2k that's nothing
[5:56:30] osklift: Let's pick Low dmg MID low dmg TOP low dmg JUNGLE and LET'S TOP IT OFF WITH EZREAL! Our hypercarry of choice!
[5:56:35] Sonicfields: the last chance was when there were inhibs down
[5:56:36] xLamonteCoxX: You need burst, or a lot of dps for late game vlad. WE doesn't have it.
[5:56:46] TheFurioso: WE LUCKY IM COULDN'T TAKE AN OBJECTIVE
[5:56:54] LeckoTUT: wtf this game
[5:57:02] mlg_rusty_spoon: we probably thought they could win in 25 minutes

[6:00:55] osklift: @toi3uon, yes they should have backed after the inhib
[6:00:56] teemoyang: Good
[6:01:01] Voltiate: Never do that comp with ezreal again, WE
[6:01:03] lxe322: FeelsBadMan

[6:02:32] dominodumb: MVP's gonna go to Mystic without a doubt but Athena really deserves props for that game.
[6:02:33] alibabie: Nami Ult got all 5..
[6:02:53] 逆轉你的逆轉: epic throw
[6:02:58] osklift: Athena can't get MVP because he is a loser
[6:03:04] TheCreeperWorldGaming: who won/
[6:03:09] TheFurioso: VLAD WAS STRONG FOR TEAMFIGHTS BUT THEY WENT TO NEXUS
[6:03:12] TheCreeperWorldGaming: ?
[6:03:20] dominodumb: WAIT HERE'S THE REAL QUESTION
[6:03:29] dominodumb: WHY WAS BEN4 SO FAR FROM THE FIGHT
[6:03:39] osklift: He had previously died
[6:03:43] iDiedOk: he got pushed back
[6:03:57] alibabie: real question don't need to be all caps bro
[6:04:10] dominodumb: caps is a lifestyle first of all
[6:04:12] cavalRy7: Sad song BibleThump
[6:04:17] iDiedOk: they should of backed after inhib and waited for him, cause IM would of won that team fight and could of dived nexus turrets and wone nexus
[6:04:18] alibabie: you got a point
[6:04:20] TheCreeperWorldGaming: !score
[6:04:44] nguyenbaodangkhoa: MYSTIC HANDSOME BOY
[6:05:12] Dagobert2424: they could not back off because otherwise WE teleport to their nexus and chase them down to delay backs
[6:05:20] Dagobert2424: so it was win or loose
[6:05:28] ProLanser: who win?
[6:05:31] GrimZillaH: *lose
[6:05:32] iDiedOk: IM had cleared wards to teleport to turret
[6:05:34] alibabie: WE
[6:05:37] dominodumb: wait did WE actually have wards in the base?
[6:05:41] Acidrain18769: They could have backed after inhib
[6:05:47] Acidrain18769: karma was taking red
[6:05:47] dominodumb: because i saw the tp onto a wave to end the game
[6:05:56] Dagobert2424: minion wave
[6:06:04] zwamp_tv: I just woke up, did I miss anything?
[6:06:06] alibabie: there was no ward in IM base
[6:06:07] iDiedOk: no they didnt have wards in base, ben had cleared the previously
[6:06:14] kingkarus: song VoHiYo
[6:06:19] dominodumb: oh right that's another reason why he was late to the fight
[6:06:24] ProLanser: !song
[6:06:34] Dagobert2424: but the wave was close enough maybe I think
[6:06:38] kingkarus: captain, anyone?
[6:06:50] Acidrain18769: Ben 12 years old
[6:06:55] iDiedOk: they could have waited for Ben4 honestly
[6:07:04] dominodumb: just, seeing ben4 have to flash forward just to get the explosive barrel that actually led to jinjao's death... that hurt my pride
[6:07:19] Dagobert2424: Ben4 vs Ben LUL
[6:07:22] dominodumb: yeah even in the 4v4 they have to respect the power of maokai leesin frontline
[6:07:36] dominodumb: wait for ben4 and win the game
