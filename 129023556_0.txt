[0:54:03] 藍色髮夾: Zet sucks
[0:54:14] razlol: except LGD wont succeed
[0:54:41] 藍色髮夾: send meiko to RNG SwiftRage
[0:55:01] goblinguy01: Meiko would make Royal Club best team in China
[0:55:23] goblinguy01: Deft got great at laning because of EDG, Meiko and Clearlove
[0:56:03] 藍色髮夾: I just dont see this EDG team achieving much
[0:56:10] hanafinit: whos starting for icon
[0:56:29] razlol: you'll see soon enough;)
[0:56:37] hanafinit: show me some juejue mid!
[0:56:51] GrimZillaH: anyone know how long till they start?
[0:57:35] razlol: should be soon
[0:57:44] razlol: depends on china
[0:57:50] goblinguy01: EDG is a good organization and they can make any players good.
[0:57:55] definitely_Diana: Rip Icon
[0:58:03] hanafinit: yessss juejue!
[0:58:08] goblinguy01: Look at s4 EDG. U, Fzzf, Koro1, Clearlove and NaMei
[0:58:15] 藍色髮夾: good but not great, that's the problem
[0:58:21] 藍色髮夾: good enough to make quarters
[0:58:25] goblinguy01: They were a good team. You cant dismiss that
[0:58:57] definitely_Diana: how long can past success carry the reputation of a team? when do we start to dismiss them, regardless of old wins? @goblibguy01
[0:59:20] goblinguy01: That depends how old is league?
[0:59:24] definitely_Diana: @RuleFive_SuperVlin Yo
[0:59:39] goblinguy01: If the team is 2 years old, and they make Quarters once and failed next year. Its okay
[0:59:59] goblinguy01: Let me give you an example of an old organization that is dismissed. CLG
[1:00:15] goblinguy01: They made Quarters in S2 with CLG.EU, but where have they been in the last 5 years?
[1:00:26] FishRoeSoup: edg was a good team, now they are just drama makers
[1:00:41] fnask10: But CLG are good friends, they play with the power of friendship and you can't take that way from them
[1:00:44] 藍色髮夾: at least clg make groups every year
[1:01:05] definitely_Diana: Good example. They saw some success at 2016 MSI, but have since tapered off. EDG just celebrated its third birthday last month
[1:01:20] definitely_Diana: @fnaskpojkenx bummer that the power of friendship doesn't win worlds, ;-D
[1:01:36] goblinguy01: I mean isn't EDG just the last stronghold of World Elite with Aaron, Fzzf and Clearlove
[1:01:42] cantspeel: bang, wolf, best friends forever
[1:01:47] 藍色髮夾: no one have really believed clg is going to win worlds, unlike edg
[1:01:48] fnask10: No but I bet you right now they all sleep in the same room and have a great time watching a horror mobie
[1:02:12] rohitgusain: idk this game. but i betted 20$ on EDG. will they win?
[1:02:21] goblinguy01: I didnt believe Royal Club were going to make to Semi finals in s3/s4
[1:02:34] FishRoeSoup: only if clearlove7 sub in today Kappa
[1:02:34] fnask10: 20 dollars give you nothing, the odds were horrible
[1:02:53] goblinguy01: That doesn't mean Royal Club fans are wrong to believe they will be 2nd in worlds
[1:02:55] definitely_Diana: I think EDG are related to WE in that they once were a single organization, but comparing the two teams now is like comparing Boeing to a Mustang. Sure they both have gas powered engines stemming from the same design, but they're completely different this far down the line
[1:02:55] rohitgusain: ya ikr . still tell me
[1:03:07] goblinguy01: Who knew OMG would choke so hard at Quarters
[1:03:19] silverchime: waiting for koro and clearlove
[1:03:30] definitely_Diana: EDG should still be favored in this matchup though, unless they devolve to OMG's craziness
[1:03:30] husseinkain: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
[1:03:43] silverchime: OMG KORO1
[1:03:49] 藍色髮夾: wait is that koro?

[1:03:57] goblinguy01: Koro1, Meiko to RNG Kappa
[1:03:57] 藍色髮夾: holy I AM HYPED
[1:03:58] fnask10: If you are stupid enough to bet on EDG to 1.14 odds or something then you should stop betting.. OMG can win
[1:04:00] silverchime: yeah koro
[1:04:09] FishRoeSoup: KORO PogChamp
[1:04:14] 影影月: Koro LUL
[1:04:29] 藍色髮夾: plz come back MSI Koro1

[1:04:50] goblinguy01: I dont follow Chinese drama
[1:04:58] goblinguy01: What is happening with EDG and LpL
[1:05:08] silverchime: koro is handsome LUL
[1:05:11] FishRoeSoup: if edg loses today, koro is going to be flamed so hard for losing to omg without proper mid laner Kappa
[1:05:44] goblinguy01: He is making his family money. How can his parents be upset at a kid who has a job...?
