[1:00:52] CasterFroskurinn: @zoomenhanced A lot of teams in the LPL use the competitive games for experimentation due to the sheer number of games rather than using scrim time as strictly as other regions.

[1:03:06] Lanternderp: @CasterFroskurinn Will you be casting any of the games tonight?
[1:03:08] CasterFroskurinn: @zoomenhanced It's not really the lack of scrims, they scrim a lot, it's the quality and structure of the scrims. I have to assume it reflects on the infrastructure of the league in general. They just don't take it seriously or have structured direction in a lot of them.

[1:13:32] ttam23: @papasmithy do you ever watch NA LCS or EU LCS ever?
[1:13:35] CasterFroskurinn: @mikehouston I agree that Elise works well with Renekton - but so does Kz and Graves. I think they might play AD mid and needed an AP jungler...
[1:13:42] Lanternderp: LPL and LCK are wrecking my NA sleep schedule man ;_;
[1:13:45] AoiiKitsune: @CasterFroskurinn, so do you stay up to watch EU games?

[1:15:00] CasterFroskurinn: @BehBehCakes That's what I'm thinking, but I don't like the pick: zed or Elise. But I could only rationalize that you would want an AP jungle to have duel AD in mid and top.
[1:15:01] NaMeiiii: Papa doesn't watch taiwan #1 region FeelsBadMan
[1:15:02] PapaSmithy: TSM is definitely good, i don't know if it will translate to international play since their botlane will struggle 2v2
[1:15:08] 티모먹는다람쥐: coco god
[1:15:15] ttam23: @papasmithy ty for answer
[1:15:17] BehBehCakes: Eh its 11:18pm where I am
[1:15:21] AoiiKitsune: @PapaSmithy, picks for MSI?
[1:15:22] AShinyDragonair: @CasterFroskurinn, Look at that Ori and Elise not even AD mid Kappa
[1:15:35] PapaSmithy: its very easy to pick for MSI, SKT will win
[1:15:42] fnask10: Im gonna go ahead and say that TSM will fall behind early game vs any good team and wont be able to recover at all
[1:15:48] Lanternderp: ez 4 skt
[1:15:51] CasterFroskurinn: @silversvr01 NB draft's tilt me and Swift's current pathing is incredibly suspect. Hopefully he plays better this series.
[1:15:51] Aberken: @PapaSmithy, who do you think is the weaker link in the TSM bot lane? Biofrost or Wildturtle?
[1:15:53] BehBehCakes: 11:18pm Hawaii
[1:15:57] chrisrox22: @PapaSmithy, G2 Kappa
[1:15:59] AoiiKitsune: @PapaSmithy, haha, I mean the teams that will go to MSI, the winner is obvious

[1:16:29] CDMLoL: Ye um NB draft is suspect to say the least lol
[1:16:30] BehBehCakes: Unless something insane happens
[1:16:36] epdm_roof: @papasmithy I feel lik TSM is good however, they almost always give up game 1 to the other team which you can't afford to do vs Korean an china teams.
[1:16:40] CasterFroskurinn: SKT's new win condition is having every champion with a Championship skin.
[1:16:41] ttam23: As long as kkoma and faker is on skt, skt wins worlds
[1:16:48] rodricide: Skt alwsys winning ResidentSleeper
[1:16:48] Lanternderp: lmao
[1:16:51] Aberken: LUL

[1:16:58] AI_Logic: Why ask LUL SKT made changes that arguably made their team stronger and they one worlds last year
[1:17:02] NaMeiiii: kkoma and faker to NA 2018 Kappa
[1:17:08] BehBehCakes: @ya5uolol, Yeah they always lose the first game... If they could figure out that game 1 they'd be so good
[1:17:12] ttam23: If kkoma leaves then skt falls apart
[1:17:18] AShinyDragonair: Kkoma and faker too good
[1:17:20] Aberken: As long as Faker is still there SKT will keep winning
[1:17:28] epdm_roof: @behbehcakes yup
[1:17:32] NaMeiiii: bang to VG next summer and easyhoon will support him Kappa

[1:17:55] Aberken: SKT added Huni and Peanut...GG
[1:18:02] ttam23: Funny when people say huni would fail in lck and he's actually one of the best tops in lck

[1:19:31] BehBehCakes: @OmgArsenal, and Reignover

[1:19:43] ttam23: Bang > deft

[1:51:08] CasterFroskurinn: @AnarkoKapitalist WC will continue to get better, but unless they get more interaction with the power regions, they'll continue to struggle internationally. There's a reason BR/TR/CIS are the strongest WC regions due to their ability to scrim and play on the major servers
[1:51:13] DrDaft44: Camille 1v3
[1:51:18] CasterFroskurinn: @Jeerna in what way?
[1:51:22] Crimson57o: That's why Camille is a ban

[1:52:58] WhoKnowsUA: renek got outscaled by almost any toplaner
[1:53:00] CasterFroskurinn: @Jeerna I'd prioritize or draft winning matchups whenever possible and just camp the *** out of that side of the map. I wouldn't think any coordinated team would be able to deal with an established "strong side" of the map. They wouldn't have coordinated vision or tactics outside: CAMP IT HE'S CAMPING ME! HALP

[1:54:02] PapaSmithy: There's a Japanese language stream for LJL yes
[1:54:03] CasterFroskurinn: @Crimson57o Fiddles doesn't bring any hard lockdown and is quite fragile. He has decent poke with his crows, but in the scheme of things - other champions like Karma do his job better than him with more transitional power and use in later stages of the game. It's not that he can't support with what's needed, just that he's not the best at it.

And then examine the specific patch and stat work.

Then became a high elo streamer - I sat Diamond I on NA before Masters existed, though I don't think I'd be that good to reach it. And I ran a commentary stream before "coaching existed" where I'd watch people's games and give them pointers. I thought it'd go well wit hcasting so I tried it out.

[2:05:32] CasterFroskurinn: @FallenKillz the two stars of QG were Doinb and Swift and they had a falling out and refused to work together. Swift had more stake in the team and kicked Doinb and Link into LSPL.
[2:05:34] altruvice: he's just another singed

[2:07:28] Chaotic_Old_Bore: @CasterFroskurinn, cohhHi been a fan since kespa a couple of years ago and was delighted when you came to cast OPL, my only critique is that you had a tendency to talk too fast but you seem to have improved on that. Keep doing what you are doing and continue to improve what is already a great casting package (knowledge and enthusiasm) cohhGV

[2:07:51] 3DigitEloPlayer: @CasterFroskurinn do you think people can have deep game understanding without being a good player? or is it more like an exception rather than the rule?
[2:08:05] AoiiKitsune: @CasterFroskurinn, what about LPL?
[2:08:13] Crimson57o: My most played this season is malphite fiddlesticks velkoz and veigar support and some kayle support but no games in ranked yet
[2:08:18] Icely_: What patch is this? 7.4?
[2:08:18] CasterFroskurinn: @Kirrawayru thanks. I for sure still talk way too fast and have a bad habit of knee capping my analysis where I get scared I'm talking to much and jsut stop - ending the point before I fully explain it or dropping a weird hand off.

[2:10:23] BuddyLoxX: @CasterFroskurinn, I've missed a lot of LPL this season so far, what are the top 3 teams to watch right now entertainment wise
[2:10:24] SilentTao: 7.4
[2:10:31] CasterFroskurinn: @InShadeOfMe The new ban system separates the good from the great teams. I'm terrified the LPL will be exposed by it on the global stage against international teams.

[2:10:48] Jeerna: @CasterFroskurinn, in my Norwegian top team, ive encountered alot of people who wanted to coach us, who say they know stuff, but actually was just a bluff. Is it something alot of people do? Talk themselves good as a coach but doesnt deliver? Or am i unlucky
[2:10:49] Crimson57o: And trust me, you guys want supports like me and not just the support fill who only play morg lol
[2:10:59] Fallz312: @griech Im probably too big to tip on those chairs lol
[2:11:14] reedemerofna: someone on IM should change their name to hungry or feeding lol xd
[2:11:14] gedvis14: @CasterFroskurinn why do teams keep picking mid game team comps and then not act decisive?
[2:11:27] huskyterrier: support fill Blitzcranks LUL
[2:11:32] 3DigitEloPlayer: @CasterFroskurinn but if the casters would start grinding ranked for whatever reason, would they be able to get to high ranks on average? like are game knowledge and skill as a player strongly correlated like that or no?
[2:11:47] Eldar_Warlock: @Crimson57o, CoolStoryBob
[2:11:56] Shade_Fin: @CasterFroskurinn So you think LPL will be outdrafted in Allstars?
[2:12:01] Jeerna: @3digiteloplayer, they are all silver Kappa
[2:12:04] usedxsoul: No
[2:12:05] CasterFroskurinn: @Jeerna I don't the west in general really understand what makes a good coach - there are so few reputable western coaches, even at the professional level. And the skill set it takes to coach can vary so much from team to team and isn't always just about the game knowledge - I'd consider that more about the analyst.

[2:13:46] CasterFroskurinn: @Orly2001 depends on what the coach is needed for - a position coach 100% yes. THey need to understand how the champion works on a micro detailed level. A macro coach - no.
[2:13:57] altruvice: the coach needs to know how to hype his/her players as well as draft a comp fit for the team.

[2:28:30] CasterFroskurinn: @Geddn I think it helps that MSI is a smaller tournament - so you only get to see the best team in LPL as there's a huge gap between the best team and even the second place team.

[2:34:42] CasterFroskurinn: @Geddn No. I think the opposite. I think it's actually because they lose their identity and back down on the international stage. Historically when they go back to their aggression they thrive or catch teams offguard.

[2:35:49] CasterFroskurinn: @Jeerna I think you loose too much of your trading power sacrificing early armor. But MR is almost more important with all these bursty supports running around.

[2:36:57] CasterFroskurinn: @Jeerna I prefer flat because I prefer lane strength as ADC as position is item dependent for it's scaling and shouldnt be eating that damage mid/late anyway when a lot of those rune sets take over

[2:37:08] Lanternderp: gotta love games that are just one long *** teamfight :D
[2:37:10] DoogieMacGyver: I'd say flat, either armor or MR: with the "no lane swap" meta early game bottom is *way* too important, you need to be able to not get pushed in, and not just lose the lane/get zoned out.

[2:39:01] Eldar_Warlock: Casters getting exited LUL
[2:39:05] DoogieMacGyver: @RiotPulse (or Froskurinn): why does riot not make very slight buffs to a bunch of champions not showing up at all? It seems like adding like...2 points of armor or a couple base AD or the like, just to attempt to widen the champ pool?
[2:39:06] Ayphis: idk if anyone else feels this way but I feel like the casters from anything besides LCK and LCS don't have enough knowledge of the game :/
[2:39:06] Lanternderp: @casterfroskurinn Are you planning on doing another reddit AMA? :)
[2:39:15] na_2_fat_2_win_opieop: My sister is plat 5 and I'm silver 4 FeelsBadMan
[2:39:18] ESTEpo: Lpl so wacky i love it ^^
[2:39:18] Geddn: Dang im hooked on this game although hopefullyn i wont be deep down under. The game looks grave for NB but if they arent carefull the junglers actions will be made null and void because all that invading have given them bad Karma so lets hope they can take some jihn and tonic after the game and be able to say Ez Keepo
[2:39:23] Crimson57o: @casterfroskurinn do you think runes should be removed? Do they really play a role or is it all just copy pasted builds no variety
[2:39:27] dindu_nufin_TriHard: FailFish If you are not HIGH ELO (plat5 or higher) pls STOP TALKING FailFish
[2:39:32] CasterFroskurinn: @Lanternderp Haven't planned one.

[2:39:54] DoogieMacGyver: I know there's a lot of complaints about how low champion diversity is this season, and it feels like its been getting worse the past couple years

[2:40:05] PulseIRL: @DoogieMacGyver Making slight adjustments is the best way to balance because the ecosystem shifts wildly. Somethings a pick is sleeper OP for a while until that 2 ad buff comes in and reminds people the champion exists

[2:40:20] slimnockey: im bronze V is that still high elo?
[2:40:21] CasterFroskurinn: @Crimson57o I don't think there is enough variety with runes to impact specific playstyles as much as say masteries. I think they could be tweaked to reach their goal of creating unique experiences on champions.
[2:40:25] dindu_nufin_TriHard: FailFish If you are not HIGH ELO (level 30 or higher) pls STOP TALKING FailFish

[2:40:49] DoogieMacGyver: @RiotPulse, i mean, I agree, I'm just saying that the past couple patches there haven't been many changes to champs that saw no competitive play

[2:41:47] PulseIRL: @DoogieMacGyver Well, balancing is based a lot off of Soloq not just competitive and all levels of play.
[2:41:49] DoogieMacGyver: @RiotPulse, i don't have access to the data right now, but since S3ish I believe the % of total champs picked at worlds has progressively gone down significantly, and the % of near 100% pick/ban champs has gone up

[2:42:24] michaelsund: Mantra E is so balanced :)
[2:42:26] DoogieMacGyver: @RiotPulse, you're telling me that your large base of paying customers has influence on balance, instead of just the pro scene? DansGame
[2:42:44] Shade_Fin: @CommyMao @Eldar_Warlock That's very normal in competitive play

[2:44:13] Dooraven: hm is snake playing today?
[2:44:21] DoogieMacGyver: @CasterFroskurinn, isn't kog's early/mid game so anemic that you almost always fall too far behind by the time kog is unstoppable?
[2:44:24] goblinguy01: Krsytal isn't ADC :(
[2:44:32] CasterFroskurinn: @Dooraven No. iG vs QG is next

[2:44:37] PapaSmithy: but Triforce/Bork is back
[2:44:41] 小さい豚ですね: @cantspeel what do you think of tristana adc currently?
[2:44:44] PulseIRL: @DoogieMacGyver In the end it's what the players feel, right? If most people feels like there's enough champion depth per role then it's fine and I think there's pretty big pools outside of maybe jungle but there's a ton of A tier picks that just aren't Rengar/Graves/Khazix

[2:45:14] camm0o: @Papasmithy do you think we will also see things like Ivern to round up the protect the kog, or lulu is enough?
[2:45:15] Ayphis: @PapaSmithy, I see everyone building BoRK now but the buff didn't seem very significant, is it really better or is everything else just worse?
[2:45:22] TaylorSift: no pulse Kreygasm
[2:45:24] mad0tsukii: I'm pretty sure you just take guinsoo's still, with how brutally the ult's mana cost increase restricts its spamming TF is a lot less useful
[2:45:24] goblinguy01: I miss Snake JuggerMaw comp in s5. Kogmaw, Lulu, Nunu, Gragas/Mao and Karma Kappa

[2:47:12] camm0o: yeah Ivern is not the type of champ/playstyle that kr junglers usually like
[2:47:18] DoogieMacGyver: @RiotPulse, I feel like absent mid there's not a ton of diversity at any role right now, except whats forced by bans. 4-6 champs at ADC, top and support?
[2:47:22] Crimson57o: So is this karma pick just a protect graves pick

[2:47:43] gerhartmm: @PapaSmithy Will Jinx actually be good? Also, are there not so many control junglers in KR as to be good Iverns?
[2:47:45] PapaSmithy: we only had 1 game of it in Korea and 2-3 bans pre-nerf, nothing after
[2:48:00] Ayphis: I don't understand why BoRK is considered to be good on so many ADC's. I see people building it on jinx/twitch/lucian/cait. I can see it being better for Kalista/Kindred/Kog but I don't see what all the fuss is about, it still seems meh :/

[5:23:59] mito_k: Fly says Ahri's trash, i believe him
[5:23:59] Dr9oC: @RawsonStanley Because Fly is good outside of the laning phase, but the general level of midlaners in LCK means that the enemy mid has an edge heading into mid game.
