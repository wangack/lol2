You're not going to beat the moneybag teams at the top who are stacked with talent. Why not get someone like cvmax or kim and have your identity be extreme hardwork/discipline

[2:26:05] GCatalinStefan: @GCatalinStefan I ma looking, but let me explain one small thing - Malrang. He was at his best a slightly below average jungler in LCK and he is smurfing in LEC. This shows the monster of a gap

[2:31:41] pandoralight24: interesting to listen about what the pro Teams talk
[2:31:42] HZNSH: why is there no uzi anyone know?
[2:31:49] nixxy_7: Faker also looking good this start of season but to early to say who is best its only start of season give it a month and things will settle
[2:31:52] circ55: @krishneeljeet Uzi won't be playing
[2:31:53] jonasfrancisolol: Krastyel best mid
[2:31:55] captainkrajick: @wildrness if xiaohu does really well the whole year that would prove that
[2:32:05] linkDJFR: bo2 ??
[2:32:06] circ55: @HZNSH He is a sub player, not good enough atm for main team
[2:32:06] nixxy_7: the meta hasnt set in it just started
[2:32:09] TfcMyq: no one really knows exactly why uzi isn't playing / when he'd be playing
[2:32:11] advenum_: man uzi still not playing?
[2:32:14] circ55: He is not what he used to be
[2:32:21] captainkrajick: @HZNSH CNY not done yet
[2:32:23] nixxy_7: and most teams are testing what works this meta
[2:32:24] circ55: @Baws_YT No
[2:32:24] AkRoLLeR_: have uzi played one single game?
[2:32:26] wildrness: xiaohu has most solokills and the best champion pool no?
[2:32:31] jonasfrancisolol: I do remember when Krastyel beat faker in the worlds, after that match, I think he s the best
[2:32:34] TfcMyq: the only concrete knowledge we have is one day before the match when official starting rosters for the series are announced
[2:32:35] captainkrajick: UZI is not playing because CNY is not over until next week chat
[2:32:39] circ55: @AkRoLLeR_ Nah

[3:15:55] wildrness: how do you win the game with zeri though? you cant seige
[3:15:57] captainkrajick: @wildrness he wasn't kicked per se, it's just that RNG 2021 couldn't find a toplaner. so xiaohu swapped top and then they got Cryin
[3:16:03] thean2003123: well karma into zeri is pretty bad
[3:16:04] coffeealien: Cryin plays good. His champ pool is the real issue.

[3:19:36] ye1l: @goodvibesoldier false, Crisp himself said on stream that they're winning more scrims with Uzi, it's just that Uzi would not be happy to return and just be an average ADC, ruin his legacy
[3:19:38] AzoggFTW: uzi benched

[3:22:37] AuxCasts: Everytime you ask if Uzi is playing he will wait another minute before he plays

[5:44:10] reko___: @ye1l lol im being objective when ur straight up lying lol they got 2v2d once to a misplay every other time was a result of BLG focusing topside corki packaged down and voli ganked
[5:44:11] dawanggg: @superdino96 If a chinese team win with actually chinese players we can say that LPL is good kekw
[5:44:13] constantinossa: AL WIN
[5:44:16] edward_zhou: @ye1l yea third death was also bad since he died 3v2 and first death was also preventable
[5:44:17] TheGuyTyga: T OMEGALUL P E SPORTS
[5:44:27] Nitron_Biohazard: JKL KEKW
[5:44:34] coffeealien: @ye1l Yeah. I agree Doggo inted that third death by still trying to greed the plates but I love how your definition of a 3v2 is a failed tower dive. Hahaha.
[5:44:38] ljpnb66: TY
[5:44:40] mistabuckk: is this couragejd? lol
[5:44:42] edward_zhou: @ye1l the third death was literally blg focusing botside and him dying anyway
[5:44:50] liangzhu: @superdino96 you forget about rng or what?
[5:44:50] ljpnb66: I think its a ez win for rng
[5:45:01] bbrrosseeantt: @dawanggg how about if TL win worlds does it count as NA or EU LUL
[5:45:07] reko___: @ye1l every death is preventable if you play super safe and some adcs do that, when theyre weakside they just do nothing, but even behind trying to push for an advantage 2v2 when it works will auto win the game
[5:45:22] laampan123: TESM LUL
[5:45:24] dawanggg: @superdino96 RNG won worlds? are u fucking crazy?

[5:45:45] shinwinter: WOW V5 looking good
[5:45:49] leygend27: did uzi play?
[5:45:52] reko___: @DuhLeeted definitely not KEKW
[5:46:03] shinwinter: @leygend27 no
[5:46:14] DuhLeeted: @reko___ xiaopeng does not look good though
[5:46:42] reko___: @DuhLeeted oh trust me i know but tian has been sprinting it even harder before he came in imo
[5:46:44] CertainlySomeoneHere: o/
[5:46:53] M012345678: \o
[5:47:07] unfaith_fool: @IQMata u think we r the staff of BLG ?
[5:47:08] 南極北極熊: BLG won?
[5:47:26] leo5789: Rich, Rookie!
[5:47:27] edward_zhou: @ye1l sure but if it doesn't work you get flamed anyway
[5:47:33] edward_zhou: @ye1l see jackeylove
[5:47:33] dawanggg: @IQMata Uzi didn't play LPL even in his prime imagine now kekw
[5:47:36] reko___: i just rmb tian going 1/4 with 3 winning lanes against some middle of the pack team
[5:47:54] dawanggg: @IQMata he just plays the finals
[5:48:46] reko___: @ye1l pushing for advantages when behind is walking a fine line and this game showed doggo walking it quite well lol going 0/3 and ending with 9k more dmg than puff
[5:49:05] Doktor_Wyvern: @reko___ but how many assists? 1/4/0 and 1/4/10 are entirely different
[5:49:16] reko___: @ye1l he definitely griefed that one 2v2 but every other death was because he was weakside is what im saying
[5:49:24] tesudinho25: OMG 2 x 0 ez

[5:49:42] SirGarland: PPGOD PPGOD
[5:49:42] reko___: @Doktor_Wyvern i mean i think he was 0/3/1 at one point dont rmb exactly tho idk how thats relevant
[5:49:43] Oroni_enby_Hijra: Vibe
[5:49:43] edward_zhou: @ye1l he did more dmg bc his team was making more space for him, it had nothing to do with "pushing for advantages when behind"
[5:49:47] LmaoLp: @reko___ good news for you then, tian's been back as main jg scrimming for TES. LUL
[5:50:06] reko___: @reko___ good god maybe i shouldnt watch TES RNG after all
[5:50:10] edward_zhou: @ye1l every tf he was just sitting behind weiwei and autoattacking which literally any pro caliber adc could do
[5:50:24] reko___: @ye1l hes the adc lol do u want him to frontline or what
[5:50:44] WatanabeSaki: KARSA BibleThump
[5:50:48] Doktor_Wyvern: @reko___ you don't know how assists are relevant when determining if a jungler is doing good or bad?
[5:51:05] 阿森是我: Karsa SeemsGood
[5:51:06] edward_zhou: @ye1l no he did his job fine but the argument of him "pushing his advantages when behind" is complete bs
[5:51:13] reko___: @Doktor_Wyvern oh my fault thought we were talking about doggo scoreline lmao
[5:51:25] SirGarland: OMG overrated OSFrog
[5:51:58] reko___: @Doktor_Wyvern tian was definitely running it that game tho it was pretty bad i cant tell u how many assists off the top of my head tho
[5:52:08] edward_zhou: @ye1l if puff and doggo are swapped puff outdamages doggo by 10k+ simply bc his team isn't inting in 1 by 1
[5:52:10] rickyho5050: tes LUL
[5:52:26] J2easoN: 10 place lpl ad > best ad in eu sadly
[5:52:31] Doktor_Wyvern: @reko___ nah, I was talking about Tian. Most of his champ pool actively wants to donate kills, so KDA is more important than just KD.
[5:52:34] SirGarland: TES and RA KEKW
[5:52:47] DayVirus: Uzi playing now or still Doggo?
[5:52:52] reko___: @ye1l i dont think TT inted 1 by 1 that game but from debating w u for a bit i feel like u just dont watch the games lol BLG found really good flash picks from poppy and naut
[5:53:15] reko___: @Doktor_Wyvern i would agree with that statement but the particular game im thinking about he was on viego not j4 so KEKW
[5:53:47] SirGarland: ROOKIE WITH ADC WutFace
[5:54:18] Doktor_Wyvern: @reko___ that's fair I suppose

[5:55:16] yylskr: lanW
[5:55:21] aeldai: who won?
[5:55:22] coffeealien: @ye1l That guy commented so fast when Doggo got chunked by the Southwind hook, it was so funny.
[5:55:26] M012345678: @swipey_ad ye v5 actually not bad this split
[5:55:30] edward_zhou: @ye1l ok sure but even then it's bc of weiwei and crisp, you could probably even put LEC adcs in that position and they would still do meaningful damage there
[5:55:35] reko___: @Doktor_Wyvern hey it happens hes had injuries and i watched the FPX documentary his gameplay depends alot on his mental/confidence and it cant be good these days hope he gets better tho
[5:55:45] swipey_ad: @M012345678 Pog
[5:55:56] Vens5: cookie with a cream Kappa

[5:56:42] bluesclues96: @cr1m3s666 they won 2-0 yesterday
[5:57:14] andre07custodio: TRIKAS
[5:57:16] reko___: @ye1l once again this is a separate arguement tho u said he got 2v2d 3 times when actually it was 1 misplay and 2 instances of TT devoting time and resources bot to stifle Doggo
[5:57:18] cr1m3s666: oh ok i was actually asking xd ty
[5:57:18] coffeealien: @reko___ What do you think will happen to Doggo after that flash to Jinx to try to kill her? I think if he flashed to Thresh, he gets the kill but he still dies to Jinx anyway. He just flipped it I guess hoping for a better result. lol
[5:57:36] leo5789: RICH! RICH! RICH!
[5:57:44] leo5789: SOLO KILL
[5:57:57] J2easoN: never saw a full game of creme excited to see him vs rookie
[5:57:58] TheOreoCupcake: BOLO NOLO Pog
[5:58:07] tesudinho25: rich is trash
[5:58:20] reko___: @coffeealien i think he didnt expect the dmg from jinx is what im guessing he was spacing jinx at first so he wasnt getting hit at all but jinx is up a full noonquiver to 2 longswords he got hit by the zap too
[5:58:20] aeldai: v5 vs okg who won?
[5:58:34] bluesclues96: @xAyEeEss didnt start
[5:59:23] reko___: @coffeealien flashing on thresh probably wouldnt be good either because he was in the bush and unless he had a ward he wouldnt be able to kill him anyway i think there u just take the free thresh flash and move on
[5:59:24] bluesclues96: aki is a giant

[6:01:39] fazed343: @iNTactWF the pope Prayge
[6:01:41] coffeealien: @reko___ Yeah. I think it's better to just back off. He did this too on that game when he flashed in front of a Nautilus hoping to get a 3 man flamethrower q. If they can quell off these Doggo moments, BLG has a good chance to have a long run in the playoffs.
[6:02:00] J2easoN: is Photic good enough to play with karsa rookie ppgod?
[6:02:05] rafawhiskas: moshi moshi

[6:02:54] edward_zhou: @ye1l do you expect them to do nothing while blg sends 3 man bot? Doggo wasn't expecting the package when he walked forward, that's a clear and obvious mistake
[6:03:00] bluesclues96: @藷葉 BLG by far
[6:03:03] reko___: @reko___ i actually think this should be encouraged in the regular season especially against weaker teams for limit testing, as long as come playoffs he knows how to hold himself back
[6:03:06] rafawhiskas: V5 win now
[6:03:19] 藷葉: Thx

[6:07:58] edward_zhou: @ye1l sure you can try to make something happen but mechanical ability is also extremely important too. Messing up against Puff and Southwind which is probably a bottom 4 bot in the league does not say very good things for when you have to go against Viper + Meiko, lwx + Hang, etc
