[5:07:00] necrolyses: What was that song?
[5:07:07] AuxCasts: @fitspire In LoL people mostly specialize, some can flex but usually at the higher level they commit to one. It's different in other games like in FPS' they kinda overlap

[5:07:12] HorrorNightmare: @AuxCasts oh so you mean amateur tournaments? good idea covering those, seems good to get better at it as well. any way someone can get feedback on some of these casts?

[5:08:03] bluesclues96: 1-6 WE PRAYGE
[5:08:04] AuxCasts: @HorrorNightmare Yeah typically those are a good start, in terms of feedback often reaching out to other casters for feedback or a VoD review is a good way to get some insight
[5:08:05] Bibliosmia: Prayge
[5:08:08] spammingparrot: @m012345678 can you understand Spanish? BibleThump LUL

[5:08:10] eddiengai: Kreygasm
[5:08:10] fitspire: @AuxCasts was just wondering because if you start with just casting some uni/amateur stuff for fun, you usually wont have a 2nd person doing the other part
[5:08:11] lordtherkild: Thumbs up :)
[5:08:20] M012345678: @spammingparrot No :)
[5:08:31] spammingparrot: @m012345678 I didn't say anything wrong BibleThump
[5:08:51] Stilleto1_: @M012345678 perhaps, do you know the song name? :)
[5:08:52] NoRiskNoGain: @spammingparrot he's not time-outing you, its the channel
[5:08:54] HorrorNightmare: @AuxCasts ay cool thx for the advice :)
[5:08:58] AuxCasts: @fitspire Yeah it helps if you have a friend or other interested party to back you up but sometimes it does come down to solo casting. I did a lot of solo cast UK tournaments back in the day to get some experience
