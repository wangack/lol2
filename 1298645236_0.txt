[3:13:57] meowmeowm222: @Lulum992 lck only streams on twitch, lpl streams on a bunch of other places (yt, here, cn stream sites)
[3:14:01] pritish27: @Lulum992 i think they probably have some other streaming platform where the viewer count is through the roof
[3:14:14] hiwlp: @TfcMyq huya?
[3:14:16] masterchief410: people watch what they enjoy why are you comparing lmao

[3:15:39] monobeno: @rockslide1 Douyu doesn't broadcast LPL anymore
[3:15:42] tixwho: huya is not actually showing direct viewerships, but a very tricky data, never trust that
[3:15:48] hiwlp: @ChebsTwitch This not the number of viewers there, it's the popularity.
[3:15:55] Utopia_17: 6.5 mil on huya rn
[3:15:55] hiwlp: @tixwho +1
[3:15:55] rockslide1: @monobeno didnt know that

[3:16:41] pchen20: LPL dont have viewship probs they all just care about if any team can win worlds
[3:16:43] Â§èÂÜ∞Ë™û: this channel is usually for someone who doesn'e understand chinese stream or doesn't want to listen to chinese
[3:17:02] tixwho: the actual number will be around 20-25k for each streaming platform, that's my guess
[3:17:08] tixwho: still a lot though
[3:17:08] BMGxSkillzz: what is huya?

[3:17:47] OzlinF8: LCK is more interesting because you get to watch 8 good teams and 2 shit teams whereas the LPL has 7 good teams and 7 irrelevant teams.
