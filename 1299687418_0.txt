[1:27:47] monobeno: @TheOreoCupcake How do players get break whenever they want when they have a contract?
[1:27:54] TheOreoCupcake: @afleot It was, happened on Feb something or towards the end of Jan. Zhuo informed the team he wanted a break so this was an urgent support pick up.
[1:27:58] nightlewave: so they benched zoom with no reason?
[1:27:59] lissuta: MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[1:28:02] monobeno: It's like a football player tell the team he don't want to play despite having a contract

[1:28:29] xenon3520: @DJZRW maybe meta champ issue.
[1:28:33] anthonylch: TES is rebranded as TES48 LUL
[1:28:44] TheOreoCupcake: @monobeno He is still part of the team but he's been playing for a long time lol. It's logical to take a break. Tian took one cuz he had some issues.
[1:28:46] afleot: @theoreocupcake I see. What about zoom though why is he benched?
[1:28:46] xenon3520: @CLG_Rampage next game is pog tho
