[3:21:44] discord_421: @thenimboo another thing to consider is RA doesn't really want to split map in this situation. By going to lee's red, it means that Jinx and Naut are left completely to the mercies of Cait Braum.

[8:49:29] ziosevielspezel: atleast we can agree when a team is good like 2020 DWG instead of LCK fans COPING T1 vs DK was the real finals KEKW
[8:49:30] fbd8b8: 🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓
[8:49:34] jamespac123: @TheOreoCupcake at this point 2020 seems to be a fluke KEKW

[8:50:00] sephiroxical19981202: Cavaliers are good because they won championship in 2016 kekw
[8:50:02] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: LPL still the best last 5 years
[8:50:03] ziosevielspezel: @jamespac123  nah DK was really good in 2020
[8:50:07] AnaGabrix: peepoHey
[8:50:08] TheOreoCupcake: @TheOreoCupcake 2020 was an accident because LPL Suning played Chinese in Quarters and Semis.
[8:50:26] M012345678: Chat doesn't know LCK and LPL are actually both good regions PepeLaugh
[8:50:27] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: @ziosevielspezel until EDG and RNG broke them in MSI and Worlds

[8:50:46] TheOreoCupcake: @ziosevielspezel TES Demolished DWG at Mid Season 2020. TES would destroy DWG if they played at worlds KEKW
[8:50:46] ziosevielspezel: @theoreocupcake  JDG took a game off of them in groups
[8:50:54] TheOreoCupcake: @TheOreoCupcake DWG got out in Groups KEKW

[8:50:57] zaraay: @M012345678 thats actually true and a good statement but lck still is a little bit better YEP
[8:51:03] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: Appearances dont count EU fans only winning
[8:51:04] eu_lost_in_playins_kekw: EUROPEAN MINOR REGION LOST A BO5 TO WILDCARDS KEKW
[8:51:08] ziosevielspezel: @theoreocupcake  maybe it would been different if TES made it to finals that year
[8:51:10] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: LPL > LCK > EU
[8:51:26] TheOreoCupcake: @ziosevielspezel And JDG wasn't even the summer champs. If DWG played TES at any point, they would have lost KEKW
[8:51:30] M012345678: @M012345678 better in what term?
