[1:20:23] Sov25: rookie playing trash competition. he would get rekt by lck mid laners easily. even pawn gets out classed by nearly every mid laner
[1:20:38] Vashnaroth: tbh Pawn hasn't been stellar for years now, he's good but nothing more
[1:20:46] Fallz312: Pawn hasn't been good since SSW
[1:20:52] ssimple2: Pawn played pretty well yesterday tbh
[1:20:53] Vashnaroth: ^ this
[1:21:11] Vashnaroth: It's not one game, it's a question of consistency
[1:21:20] Fallz312: Is Imp still a thing
[1:21:31] Sov25: yea he can go from hero to zero very fast
[1:21:39] FishRoeSoup: thats different, pawn was supposedly a sub for edg but he came back coz scout wasnt working too well in spring.. rookie is always good

[1:22:18] rodricide: Is exhaust nerfed in the patch they are playing?
[1:22:22] ssimple2: he's always been volatile though
[1:22:47] Sov25: @fishroesoup don't see much except playing lane bullies a lot and team still being mediocre
[1:23:06] Vashnaroth: Implying Talon is *** in competitive Kappa
[1:23:08] AngieFoxtrot: Wasn't it that Pawn was injured which is why they stared Scout last year, and Scout just worked out in the end?
[1:23:12] Fallz312: Uzi should just sub for SKT so he can finally win worlds, then retire.
[1:23:24] choko97: bengi lul

[1:23:32] Vashnaroth: Welp that was a dive
[1:23:43] FishRoeSoup: @Sov25 coz IG's bot lane was a long time issue which was barely solved earlier this year
[1:24:00] Sov25: @fishroesoup still mediocre now
[1:24:10] Fallz312: skt is like the patriots. once you leave, you'll suck
[1:24:43] Vashnaroth: It's not like any person who left SKT got a contract on a team that was nearly as competitive as a unit tho
[1:25:01] AngieFoxtrot: Duke is doing well, which is nice to see

[2:58:38] Vashnaroth: TSM only was a serious contender for semis/finals in Season 6 and they chocked like mofos in groups
[2:58:49] 逆轉你的逆轉: is he crying?
[2:59:01] goblinguy01: In S4 if SK Gaming didn't troll, SK would have 2-0 TSM
[2:59:13] buckmtim: I think he has a lazy eye
[2:59:17] SylvrPoint: I can agree with that point, I actually expected them to hit Quarters/Semis

[2:59:47] ArtWardTTV: alliance
[3:00:00] SylvrPoint: C9 got carried by SKT in the end though, if SKT intentionally lost to FW, C9 wouldn't get into Quarters
[3:00:06] nick_curb: TTours
[3:00:19] Vashnaroth: They wouldn't have beaten ROX nor SKT, that's for sure, but still they chocked
[3:00:20] goblinguy01: No. SKT got stomped by Flash Wolves lol
[3:00:47] SylvrPoint: FW beat SKT on the first game in Group Stages, they lost on their second game.
[3:00:50] spam_the_wut_face: Remember Riot Casters put TSM is 3rd team at Worlds, only behind SKT and ROX lul

[3:01:32] goblinguy01: TSM had only beaten royal Club once
[3:01:38] Vashnaroth: Same with EDG, they had an astonishing season in LPL
[3:01:41] SylvrPoint: Uzi has always been a good ADC in my books
[3:01:52] tockersoce: why

[4:15:02] Vashnaroth: I don't think so
[4:15:06] AnthonyKaycee: there r chinese?

[4:16:40] avifaraday: that how u throw a game, guys
[4:17:16] Vashnaroth: Good play from GT tho, Snake just tunneled too hard on the Ekko
[4:17:32] SylvrPoint: Republic is really going ham
[4:17:33] roll1ng1: fat ekko
[4:17:53] Hugoohc: Repulic married me please <3
[4:18:19] nakeki: HightLight forrm ekko

[4:19:06] leonora152000: lul stupid snake EleGiggle
[4:19:22] roll1ng1: lol
[4:19:23] SylvrPoint: The only thing Jayce was able to do was out CS the Rumble with pressure
[4:19:33] nakeki: backdoor ??
[4:19:39] Hugoohc: nice scape
[4:19:39] imay42: and that did nothing for the team
[4:19:47] jaekun93: Escape master sofm Kappa

[4:19:56] VhPhi: useless jayce
[4:20:02] huff711: i like a good bar fight
[4:20:09] SylvrPoint: Don't really think it would matter though, GT's scaling is slightly better over Snake imo
[4:20:09] roll1ng1: rekt
[4:20:14] Vashnaroth: Ohq NotLikeThis
[4:20:57] imay42: u see that dmg from shock blast!!! so pathetic
[4:21:40] nakeki: Ohq Why ??
[4:22:02] SylvrPoint: Tank + Elise maybe would've been better? Or were they banned out?
[4:22:11] Vashnaroth: Tbh it's more Snake messing up on the map rather than Jayce not doing damage
[4:22:31] nhattan2512: ?
[4:22:41] Vashnaroth: The overchase on Republic with TP use from Flandre that lost them 2 towers was tragic
[4:22:44] SylvrPoint: That too, the bad positioning on zz1tai in the early game also contributed to that
[4:23:13] Vashnaroth: What a bad Rumble ult
[4:23:19] Vashnaroth: They still win this tho
[4:23:24] Alberkahn: What a bad decision

[4:24:48] Vashnaroth: It was all Republic
[4:24:54] leonora152000: snake & liquid on the same boat now 4Head
[4:24:56] imay42: the only dmg is ashe here
[4:25:05] imay42: with some weird items
[4:25:24] GillesDerai: Jebaited

[4:42:54] SylvrPoint: The SofM target ban hurts
[4:43:04] Oasis9527: just ppl don't interest in LPL like before
[4:43:28] SylvrPoint: If GT takes Kha'Zix, Snake can just take Elise + Lulu/Karma
[4:43:35] imay42: wow, gt so scared of meta junglers
[4:43:36] Vashnaroth: The Rengar Graves bans you mean @SylvrPoint?

[4:44:25] SylvrPoint: Graves is like 60/40 ban imo tho
[4:44:32] Vashnaroth: Lulu Kog?

[4:45:08] Lionheart_Diz: dunno if theyd run that against a camille
[4:45:17] Lionheart_Diz: could just be lulu ashe
[4:45:28] SylvrPoint: 0-2 on LS
[4:45:37] Zulkuss: Vashnaroth, IIRC, he were good
[4:45:37] Vashnaroth: Snake should prob take Ashe now
[4:45:47] SylvrPoint: The Syndra 2nd pick?
[4:45:47] luciferpham: sofm quite good on leesin
[4:45:54] imay42: no tank again
[4:45:59] luciferpham: why not leesin
[4:46:07] Vashnaroth: Camille Syndra Elise Ashe would be a sick pick comp

[4:46:20] Vashnaroth: Good teams can win without tanks
[4:46:23] Alberkahn: no lee because gt sin it comin

[4:46:31] imay42: but they dont, lul
[4:46:57] Lionheart_Diz: elise and rumble are tank shredders
[4:46:59] SylvrPoint: By now a safe comp would be Ashe + Tahm or so

[4:49:36] FishRoeSoup: which side is defensive u guys talking about?
[4:49:43] Lionheart_Diz: I like the Snake draft better
[4:49:48] Vashnaroth: Snake's comp is a pick comp
[4:49:50] luciferpham: wait for game 3
[4:50:00] SylvrPoint: Yeah, Snake's draft seems better if they can get some picks early
[4:50:18] r4steiro: only if
[4:50:22] Vashnaroth: That's why I would've loved to see the Ashe instead
[4:50:33] imay42: if....if is good
[4:50:39] roll1ng1: TF in 2017 BrokeBack
[4:50:59] Lionheart_Diz: ashe - lulu would have been sooo much better
[4:51:17] Vashnaroth: Why not Taliyah instead of TF tho
[4:51:21] FishRoeSoup: ashe is just better than cait in a lot of aspects
[4:51:22] SylvrPoint: If GT wanted to shut down the Lucian/Thresh lane, they could also snatch Shen
[4:51:54] SpearXros: LUL
[4:51:55] FishRoeSoup: that cleanse Kappa
[4:52:22] Zulkuss: SylvrPoint, and go Rumble mid?
[4:52:43] SylvrPoint: @Zulkuss, First pick Shen for safety, Camille was locked in anyways

[4:58:10] FishRoeSoup: NICE HITBOX RITO 4Head
[4:58:28] imay42: XY
[4:58:50] SylvrPoint: It's actually pretty hard to judge right now imo
[4:59:51] Vashnaroth: Depends on execution, both teams scale pretty evenly, maybe GT has the edge late game with Cait
[4:59:53] SylvrPoint: All lanes are except Top are about equal in CS, and Xubin is 200 or so ahead in gold only
[4:59:54] imay42: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[5:00:02] Vashnaroth: Ok this is big

[5:00:32] SylvrPoint: Ocean Drake is not even considered
[5:00:44] FishRoeSoup: how does cait behind nearly 20 cs.. interesting
[5:01:10] imay42: they had useless jayce with 0 dmg and 0 tankiness
[5:01:15] SylvrPoint: I believe it's cause Snake positioned badly, and double TP plays
[5:02:01] imay42: omg there free dragons...come on
[5:02:16] Hugoohc: ocean adragon is really ***
[5:02:16] SylvrPoint: Ocean isn't actually that significant in the later game
[5:02:27] imay42: golf at least
[5:02:34] imay42: gold*
[5:02:43] adamxx: ocean is still nice for siege comp
[5:02:46] SylvrPoint: Dragons don't provide gold
[5:02:47] telepathine: completely safe Kappa
[5:02:48] FishRoeSoup: TIL build tf like a tank 4Head
[5:03:04] SylvrPoint: They are just trying to make picks on SofM's pathing
[5:03:08] adamxx: dragons havent provided gold in years lol
[5:03:17] g3ther: why is lulu lvl 5?
[5:03:18] imay42: @SylvrPoint no gold? like, at all?
[5:03:26] SylvrPoint: None at all
[5:03:28] adamxx: no gold
[5:03:28] Zulkuss: Huh, Rumble not having cs lead looks weird
[5:04:23] SylvrPoint: They can consider moving bot to top now and pressure for top turret
[5:04:46] FishRoeSoup: interesting hook...
[5:04:47] imay42: fking feeder
[5:04:52] SylvrPoint: Kryst4l FailFish

[5:05:30] Vashnaroth: stopping the top tower from going down
[5:05:34] LeckoTUT: wasnt kr4stal an adc player?
[5:05:41] Zulkuss: yeah
[5:05:42] Vashnaroth: And most likely trading now
[5:05:47] Vashnaroth: keeps the gold dap

[5:05:51] SylvrPoint: Yeah...
[5:05:54] Zulkuss: BigBrother main too, apparently

[5:07:03] FishRoeSoup: actually sofm just played support few weeks ago as well.. was hilarious
[5:07:06] SylvrPoint: By now they just need to play 4-1 and pressure mid turret
[5:07:07] imay42: he should have kiled her
[5:07:08] lilse7en5: omg
[5:07:23] solcius: i think GT will win taht

[5:07:55] SylvrPoint: Unfortunately none of us are doing it.. FeelsBadMan
[5:08:06] Vashnaroth: Yea, 4-1 might be the only viable solution since TF ult is a thing
[5:08:07] imay42: NotLikeThis
[5:08:11] FishRoeSoup: @LeckoTUT sofm tried out support, then they decide krystal was better
[5:08:11] LeckoTUT: who was jungling for snake then?
[5:08:22] Vashnaroth: If you move Syndra in the Cait lane she can get collapsed on by the TF
[5:08:26] cantspeel: Mint
[5:08:29] FishRoeSoup: @LeckoTUT former snake adc mint
[5:08:37] cantspeel: HA beat you Roe

[5:10:02] KorendSlicks: But more busted
[5:10:29] Zulkuss: they need better shitcaller
[5:10:38] Zulkuss: preferably a support main one
[5:10:46] FishRoeSoup: this has to be the game with the least ninja tabis Kappa

[5:16:17] imay42: 7k gold lead? Sound like a challenge to throw
[5:16:17] Vashnaroth: It's not the damage from Camille, it's her kit that's overloaded as ***
[5:16:32] SylvrPoint: 4-1, they can't 1v1 Camille at all, so they either have to send another one to top or lose top turret
[5:16:48] Vashnaroth: Stun, slow, %dmg, shield, mobility, AA reset, pick ult
[5:16:52] roll1ng1: lol
[5:16:53] imay42: but no one can beat camille 1v1

[5:17:30] Vashnaroth: Rammus top, boys.
[5:17:32] SylvrPoint: They can just win by forcing 4-1s
[5:17:37] solcius: my mum beats camille
[5:17:41] Vashnaroth: LUL
[5:17:45] KorendSlicks: Jayce can't beat Camille FeelsBadMan
[5:17:47] Zulkuss: So, to beat a broken champ, you must play broken champ? 🤔
[5:17:58] KorendSlicks: I guess
[5:17:59] Azureee7: Every champ is broke 4Head
[5:18:07] 1bertu: Poppy beats camille the list goes on and on
[5:18:14] FishRoeSoup: No, you just need to pull out the traditional season 1 auto attack based champions Kappa

[5:24:08] SylvrPoint: Oh we're back?
[5:24:30] solcius: what they can win
[5:24:33] SylvrPoint: GT can somehow win if Snake throws hard somehow.
[5:24:45] solcius: just def cait penta
[5:24:46] Zulkuss: ^
[5:24:48] KappaFrankerZXD: GT can win if snake throws and then throws and then throws
[5:25:02] SylvrPoint: Maybe like they get hit by a 5-man equalizer on the Baron and then gets it stolen
[5:25:10] FishRoeSoup: GT dont have any advantages in teamfight though, unless they pick someone
[5:25:22] Zulkuss: a throw + Baron could give GT the game
[5:25:32] solcius: uh elise is -1
[5:25:32] Vashnaroth: If they get a godlike flank and pick Camille off early
[5:25:35] imay42: okay...baron first
[5:25:45] imay42: just dont die plz dont die
[5:26:04] SylvrPoint: They can force a baron now
[5:26:08] solcius: now is done
[5:26:21] SylvrPoint: Flandre shouldn't TP there though, he should just continue pressuring.
[5:26:27] Zulkuss: yup
[5:26:37] imay42: and now could be a perfect throw! Go snake!
[5:26:42] Vashnaroth: Nah you can't risk a late TP with Rumble TF collapsing
[5:26:50] imay42: loose with baron and 10k gold+
[5:26:52] FishRoeSoup: RUN IT DOWN MID BigBrother
[5:26:57] Vashnaroth: He played it safe and it's ok, he doesn't need TP right now
[5:27:06] Vashnaroth: He can just move between lanes
[5:27:43] FishRoeSoup: OHQ PogChamp

[5:36:05] FishRoeSoup: hearing to the current lck casters, it feels like watching two lpl channels at the same time Kappa
[5:37:00] SylvrPoint: I realized today that slow chats like this feels way better.
[5:38:17] Vashnaroth: Fast chats are usually 90% memes
[5:38:26] Vashnaroth: Or Twitch chat spammerinos
[5:38:32] 허형우: memes are the only purpose of twitch chat
[5:39:13] SylvrPoint: Jayce again after that Game 1?
[5:39:52] Vashnaroth: It wasn't all on Jayce

[6:02:33] nerobotas: WHO HAS BETTER CHANCES TO WIN ? GAME TALENTS OR SNAKE?
[6:02:37] FishRoeSoup: Kreygasm that dmg
[6:02:39] SylvrPoint: Judging by how it's going, I doubt Snake can win already
[6:02:43] Alberkahn: CAPS LOCK WINS
[6:03:04] TheWarlockJohn: gt win most likely if we are to judge by comps
[6:03:06] nerobotas: sorry, just thinking that caps make by D biger
[6:03:08] Vashnaroth: if this goes late the Kog will murder everything
[6:04:28] PulseIRL: type 1 for godgoon win
[6:04:32] Alberkahn: standard kog
[6:04:35] derr3ck: 2
[6:04:35] FishRoeSoup: 1

[6:08:35] g3ther: which minute do you guys consider as late game?
[6:08:43] ZhengleVGC: ausRekt
[6:08:46] Alberkahn: after 25
[6:08:48] SylvrPoint: About 35 I guess
[6:08:48] xcpn: 28+
[6:08:55] halloderbaer: 35+
[6:09:14] FishRoeSoup: after level 16 on major members
[6:09:27] FishRoeSoup: jin air 50min is early game
[6:09:28] SylvrPoint: In about 35, Kog'Maw would be at 5~6 items, that's the point where SNAKE has a low chance to win if they haven't got inhibs
[6:09:32] Vashnaroth: 25+ seems good, but it really depends on the laning phase
[6:09:36] Kimzark: the minute the enemy team is so ahead you cant do anything else... we get into to "late" to comeback "game" Kappa
[6:09:45] RustyHippo9: imo depends on the objectives left on the map, not based on time
[6:09:51] PulseIRL: Late game is 3+ Items/lvl16~
[6:10:27] LeckoTUT: LUL
[6:10:33] Alberkahn: Lucian ults are trash
[6:10:41] FishRoeSoup: TIL how to counter rumble with banner of command 4Head
[6:11:56] g3ther: on bet sites, it's 3.25 that GT will win
