[1:09:31] AKBouse: T1 is a well oiled machine. Everyone else has weaknesses that can be exploited.
[1:09:32] bluesclues96: @lolrandom_qaq no u can see the title that they are the second series

[1:09:58] bluesclues96: i knew RNG was gonna beat LNG. LNG are good but they only faced bottom teams, that's why they were 7-0
[1:09:58] datzed7890: I think RA defeat RNG
[1:09:59] omnialicent: but do not underestimate TES and BLG too
[1:10:01] Kumquatjk2: even if zeus loses top can any bot lane other than edg beat guma keria?

[1:10:32] nabadazz: @tcv69 ur wrong
[1:10:35] akexecution: @skyyaolol i mean edg definitely could beat t1
[1:10:37] GamesBondTV: fuck what do i take boys
[1:10:38] eliquinzel: This years Worlds is going to be excited, so many strong teams in LCK and LPL.
[1:10:41] Leroimerl1: @yuanqiyun yu spit fact !
[1:10:46] dejvsterkek: T1 would be favorites in a BO5 against all LPL teams rn. LNG and RNG would be closest
[1:10:48] Indektio: @pchen20 but can anyone outside of edg bot win t1 obt
[1:10:51] pyro_kertok: @skyyaolol But none of them will beat Astralis at worlds. So what does it matter?
