[4:35:30] hypotermal: Riot's stats on which regions have the best international results past 2 years? Yeah sounds manipulated to me
[4:35:34] BootOfficiaI: so is froggen the best team fighter in NA?
[4:35:37] cavalRy7: BABY SPIDER JUMPING WutFace
[4:35:38] michaelsund: Bo5 can usually indicate which team is better
[4:35:52] BootOfficiaI: he's definitely a monster in teamfighting but to say he's best is iffy. he has highest DPM bc he plays scaling mages
[4:35:52] SweetAgony: are the hosts reading le chat?
[4:35:58] BootOfficiaI: you need context to understand stats
[4:36:05] SweetAgony: or they don't care bout us? the viwers

[4:36:39] yaaz000: still worth for imay
[4:36:39] osklift: LPL chat is so dead that the caster actually could follow it DansGame
[4:36:42] PatriusW: @sweettAgony, Too busy casting
[4:36:46] SweetAgony: hope edg lose
[4:36:47] I_Love_Asa: Speaking of Froggen, how will Echo Fox do VS FlyQuest tonight?
[4:36:48] BootOfficiaI: or russell westbrook's perfect triple double. he only got it because he only shot 6 times to make sure he got it
[4:36:52] SweetAgony: >.> duno why but just cuz
[4:36:55] BootOfficiaI: stats need context
[4:36:59] goblinguy01: I can say, "People who play Middle Lane in LoL has lower chance is Breast cancer...."
[4:37:07] solcius: not worth at all
[4:37:07] BootOfficiaI: exactly^
[4:37:13] BootOfficiaI: pointless correlations are another one
[4:37:17] goblinguy01: I could find data on it comparing Mid landers and Breast cancer
[4:37:20] Skylinez33: fk context just make rumors
[4:37:22] hypotermal: How ignorant can you be? lmfao
[4:37:23] BootOfficiaI: its basic fkn stats

[4:37:37] BootOfficiaI: he might be
[4:37:39] osklift: Pick one please Kappa
[4:37:43] Skylinez33: froggen isnt
[4:37:48] SweetAgony: this is 7 wins out of 7 matches?
[4:37:51] I_Love_Asa: I started following LoL again last week, why is Echo Fox doing poorly?
[4:37:53] Skylinez33: kda whore
[4:37:55] KappaFrankerZXD: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer
[4:37:59] I_Love_Asa: Is it their shot calling?
[4:37:59] goblinguy01: Or "People who don't play LoL make 5% more in stem degrees .."
[4:38:03] osklift: Froggen > Piglet > Faker
[4:38:03] BootOfficiaI: he's playing like a monster. i brought him up ONLY to make the point that stats need context
[4:38:07] osklift: Everybody knows this
[4:38:08] solcius: If u play jungle, you have high chances of being stabbed someday
[4:38:23] yaaz000: zet is playing really well they have to kill hi mor edg wins

[4:38:30] KappaFrankerZXD: @sweettAgony Who?
[4:38:31] Lord_Taurusan: 3?
[4:38:33] 1EatCareBears: playing adc helps with self-esteem issues
[4:38:35] Skylinez33: Junglers have highest chance to kill jungle minions
[4:38:36] TheSgnl: Mancloud > Froggen > Faker
[4:38:36] michaelsund: So you imply there is no correlation in NA nevet reaching semis and being bad
[4:38:37] BootOfficiaI: Kappa
[4:38:39] SweetAgony: like both teams
[4:38:52] Skylinez33: Toplaners have highest chance to run TP
[4:38:52] KappaFrankerZXD: @sweettAgony If EDG wins this game the series is over, and if IM wins they have to win 1 more to win the series.
[4:38:52] SweetAgony: agnest each other, how many time to qualify to next round
[4:38:55] osklift: How could I forget about the legend himself, Mandatory Cloud!?
[4:38:58] I_Love_Asa: I mained ADC for a few years :D
[4:39:03] SweetAgony: oooh
[4:39:08] SweetAgony: @KappaFrankerZXD ty man
[4:39:08] Skylinez33: Most players run Flash
[4:39:11] I_Love_Asa: I felt like it was the most fun and skillful role
[4:39:14] BootOfficiaI: NA used to be bad but look at the players they have
[4:39:15] belacqua_: @I_Love_Asa, if Akaadian doesn't get a huge lead early they have no win conditions
[4:39:20] BootOfficiaI: $$$
[4:39:33] Skylinez33: after watching LCK.. NA is still bad
[4:39:35] BootOfficiaI: @EsLirael, its cuz the games are 4v5 for them. keith is legit terrible
[4:39:37] hypotermal: First of all, Froggen is definitely not playing well enough to be called a monster, and second of, all, after explaining context and origins of the statistics, you are still too ignorant to accept the truth
[4:39:41] PatriusW: EDG PLS FailFish
[4:39:41] I_Love_Asa: @EsLirael, Akaadian is the superstar player? Isn't Froggen?
[4:39:42] BootOfficiaI: for lcs at least
[4:39:42] SweetAgony: na = north murica? or is it a team called na representing north murica?
[4:39:42] 1EatCareBears: yea na is probably number 2
[4:39:44] hypotermal: sad.
[4:39:50] BootOfficiaI: froggen is playing well enough to be called a monster nub
[4:39:52] KappaFrankerZXD: and if IM wins this and EDG wins the next one I win $3,000
[4:39:52] Skylinez33: EU and NA cant stand even close to LCK
[4:39:52] DQO07: NA is the only major region to never win a world finals, or even attend a world finals, FeelsGoodMan
[4:39:55] michaelsund: Look at China with all these kr players last year LUL
[4:40:06] BootOfficiaI: if u cant see that oh well XD

[4:40:18] SweetAgony: why would u win 3k$ @KappaFrankerZXD
[4:40:20] gerhartmm: Froggen is clearly the best mid laner in the world. Anyone who says otherwise is retarded Kappa
[4:40:21] belacqua_: @I_Love_Asa, Nah, Froggen has never been good enough to build a team around, hes had some good games but Akaadian was huge early in the split
[4:40:25] DQO07: Oh, and did i mention they have less NA players than imported EU players LUL
[4:40:27] KappaFrankerZXD: @sweettAgony betting LUL
