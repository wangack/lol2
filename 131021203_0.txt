[0:05:24] rebeccamo: early LPL Kreygasm
[0:08:27] CasterFroskurinn: Hello!
[0:08:46] rebeccamo: @CasterFroskurinn not casting today? Kappa
[0:09:00] CasterFroskurinn: @rebeccamo Sick - Rusty picking up the slack for me today.
[0:11:08] grave1l: HeyGuys
[0:11:29] grave1l: MingLee MingLee MingLee
[0:13:49] c9kennedy: does icon really have a tattoo on his hand?
[0:14:30] CasterFroskurinn: So does Mystic actually.
[0:14:42] Ripulpos: Froskurinn!! HeyGuys
[0:14:50] CasterFroskurinn: :)
[0:14:56] nuppan21: :)
[0:20:57] CasterFroskurinn: I ate the most amazing chicken for lunch. I'm just sitting here missing that chicken still...
[0:22:23] CasterFroskurinn: What kind of meat cut?
[0:22:54] CasterFroskurinn: lol fair.
[0:23:44] yoosong: what brand of foundation is Icon wearing
[0:23:55] CasterFroskurinn: Photoshop
[0:24:10] yoosong: So he doesn't have smooth skin like that in real? :(
[0:25:04] CasterFroskurinn: In seriousness, in my experience working Riot events the makeup artists actually do very little to "hide" imperfections or create "perfect skin" they believe in making the players look like themselves.
[0:25:39] CasterFroskurinn: So while the players do wear makeup on stage, it's usually very light. Even the Casters usually have light makeup compared to other events - such as red carpet events and such.
[0:27:10] brandoumad: it's so weird seeing WE in first again
[0:27:17] yoosong: :( half a hour, gonna take a nap
[0:28:18] ogdon51: Icon holding his wrist like he's checking it for a heart beat after an intense carpal tunnel scare
[0:28:46] CasterFroskurinn: He's giving you that "I'mma 'bout to steal your gurl" look
[0:29:34] Tylar_7: interesting music
[0:30:49] CasterFroskurinn: Our Producer went out of his way to hand select all new music for the LPL. We have some rap, some pop, hard rock, alternative, and some EDM. It's as eclectic as our casting roster.
[0:30:58] Rick_zip: BR
[0:31:11] CavernaGeek: br oq
[0:31:24] Grimolnir: The real question is: is it as fresh as your casting roster?
[0:31:28] CasterFroskurinn: I call this the Pulse Song.
[0:31:55] Grimolnir: Not enough accordion to be the Pulse song tbh.
[0:32:28] hulkaldossari: sup
[0:33:29] Tylar_7: Froskurinn i didnt realize you would be in chat too xD
[0:33:50] CasterFroskurinn: I'm here all night - doing graphics for the show and chilling with everyone.
[0:34:06] Grimolnir: PogChamp
[0:34:14] innu2919: PogChamp
[0:34:37] Tylar_7: hey pretty good
[0:35:13] CasterFroskurinn: 3:37pm in Sydney.

[0:36:26] Tylar_7: 12:38 am on east coast USA USA
[0:38:03] zyrf1: Icon KappaPride
[0:38:04] Tylar_7: Froskurinn is a great caster but no one can compete with the punking Phreak Kappa
[0:38:17] zyrf1: OMGAzael
[0:39:50] CasterFroskurinn: Phreak said something hilarious backstage at worlds - we were the only two in the green room and I it was just quiet before he breaks the silence with: "It's fine to like things, but if you like really specific things it gets really creepy. It's fine to say: I like children. It is NOT okay to say: I like five year olds." I almost pissed myself I laughed so hard.
[0:40:26] Tylar_7: Thats Phreak for ya
[0:40:37] CasterFroskurinn: His delivery of the joke was 10/10.
[0:40:42] Haethos: FROSK PogChamp
[0:40:45] Tylar_7: i would love to have a 1 on 1 conversation with him
[0:42:02] Grimolnir: Anybody else KappaPride for Doinb?
[0:42:22] CasterFroskurinn: He's adorable
[0:42:44] FishRoeSoup: Mystic KappaPride > everyone else
[0:42:44] Rubberdubber69: im KappaPride for Imp
[0:42:56] Grimolnir: DansGame Impu....
[0:43:50] FishRoeSoup: no more imp, only omp MingLee
[0:44:32] CasterFroskurinn: He's gonna give NB the pImp hand tonight.
[0:44:43] Tylar_7: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:45:13] Tylar_7: @CasterFroskurinn, why doesnt fantasy LCS involve asian leagues?
[0:45:32] ChasingPurpose: ^
[0:45:46] CasterFroskurinn: @NPSpartan I don't know. But can you image how hard it'd be to get Fantasy points with the LPL? Between the roster rotations and the random victories/defeats. I'd rage out.
[0:45:57] KibbleFat: OMG Gogoing Kreygasm
[0:46:03] CasterFroskurinn: You'd have Bengi and get blocked by a rando Ocean sub.
[0:46:25] Tylar_7: ya but thats what happening to my bb Impact right now with C9
[0:46:32] Tylar_7: plz dont play rey C9
[0:46:39] Tylar_7: i need my points
[0:47:02] CasterFroskurinn: It used to be that NA player earn more points than EU - is that still true?
[0:47:08] PKOmega: hey man Ray makes spicy memes
[0:47:23] Tylar_7: thats how it is now since EU players arent guarunteed to play 2 games a week
[0:48:05] Sourke: @casterfroskurinn hey! Do you think there's a chance omg will take a game off we?
[0:48:54] Tylar_7: like all my eu players for the past 2 weeks only been getting 1 game a week and its frustrating cuz i got people like Jankos and vizicsacsi
[0:50:18] CasterFroskurinn: It's always possible because LPL - but in WE's current form, I doubt it. They are very clean in their macro.
[0:50:41] Gnerd_Rage: owah
[0:50:43] PKOmega: PogChamp I'm always down for a good fiesta PogChamp
[0:50:58] cantspeel: Frosko! are you casting today1?
[0:50:59] shapoppi: @CasterFroskurinn, where is dade?
[0:51:26] Sourke: I'm glad we is doing well this year so far, their organization has always been one of my favorites since 2012
[0:52:30] Midl4nekingdom: FROSK Kreygasm <3
[0:52:59] CasterFroskurinn: @shapoppi Dade is no longer signed to NB or QG.
[0:53:07] Midl4nekingdom: atlus' addition to lck was such a pleasant surprise - let's hope we get froskurinn casting LCK soon
[0:53:32] FishRoeSoup: now the whole world is filled with oce casters Jebaited
[0:53:53] PKOmega: hey man those OCE voices are Kreygasm
[0:54:06] ChasingPurpose: all the oce casters reuniting at worlds Kreygasm
[0:54:12] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn, how do you feel about casting LCK? or is your love for the chinese scene too big OpieOP
[0:54:43] FishRoeSoup: oce: we cant dominate summoner's rift, but we will dominate the caster desk 4Head
[0:55:04] CasterFroskurinn: @jinairkuzan I'm far too committed to the LPL. Although I have gotten to cast the LCK teams at international events and a lot of their players past and present. They are mah babies <3
[0:55:05] Sourke: @casterfroskurinn what's your favorite twitch emote? EleGiggle
[0:55:14] zyrf1: nb3Weeb
[0:55:14] CasterFroskurinn: @Sourke I like the rainbow face
[0:55:32] cantspeel: @FishRoeSoup waddup Soupy

[0:55:43] CasterFroskurinn: @FishRoeSoup That feel when the OCE casters get more done internationally than all of the OPL teams :>
[0:55:46] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn, appreciate the response thank you <3
[0:55:48] FishRoeSoup: @cantspeel good afternoon sir Keepo
[0:56:17] FishRoeSoup: @CasterFroskurinn damn thats a harsh truth Kappa
[0:56:48] Midl4nekingdom: do mystic and icon have the same hand tattoo 🤔
[0:56:50] jarvitz: WE WANT RUSTY
[0:57:07] CasterFroskurinn: Mystic has a rosee on his hand. Icon has the dude from crash bandicoot - or that's what it looks like.
[0:57:11] lxe322: Icon's hand hurts? WutFace
[0:57:28] Midl4nekingdom: tyTY frosk <3
[0:57:30] jarvitz: @casterfroskurinn did rusty ever get his clothes
[0:57:32] rebeccamo: maybe the same KappaPride
[0:57:42] CasterFroskurinn: @jarvitz he looks snappy on the desk right now.
[0:57:55] poorardia: @CasterFroskurinn how do you think rng would do at msi?
[0:57:58] CasterFroskurinn: You cant see it - but the casters are dancing behind the desk. Raz is LOSING it.
[0:58:03] KappaFrankerZXD: who wins NB vs LGD?
[0:58:17] KappaFrankerZXD: 🤔
[0:58:19] jarvitz: idk if that's good or bad. he said he forgot them on twitter
[0:58:24] CasterFroskurinn: @rexraptor10 I just hope we don't lose to WC teams at this point. Praying. But it's hard to say because everyone but Korea looks really rough.
[0:58:27] SmLeaves: are koreans banned from LPL?

[1:02:01] OMGScootsRIP: No Frosk? SeemsGood
[1:02:03] lxe322: Rusty is such a good guy BibleThump
[1:02:06] Midl4nekingdom: get better soon BibleThump
[1:02:16] CasterFroskurinn: Rusty looks like a boat captain with that vest.
[1:02:21] 0M3GAD4RK: spoiler??
[1:02:29] KappaFrankerZXD: they may aswell just skip WE vs OMG
[1:02:35] KappaFrankerZXD: we win 2-0 in 20 min stomps
[1:02:37] 0M3GAD4RK: 2-1
[1:02:39] ChasingPurpose: he can rock my boat you know what I'm sayin KappaPride
[1:02:43] CasterFroskurinn: ^^^^
[1:02:43] Midl4nekingdom: rusty's hair is making him look much older today
[1:02:46] THEchanllenger: I feel like WE is not improving so much. They are no 1 because EDG is not good as it was
[1:02:53] FishRoeSoup: rusty is captain jack without a ship
[1:03:05] Admiralcholo: Is Zero still on team WE??
[1:03:09] jarvitz: @casterfroskurinn so are you still at the studio or what? since you said you saw rusty before they went live
[1:03:22] Surfinerd: TriHard Razl meme maker room TriHard
[1:03:23] CasterFroskurinn: @Admiralcholo Yes! But he's not their starter - but he works with the team backstage
[1:03:31] OMGScootsRIP: TriHard
[1:03:46] Admiralcholo: @casterfroskurinn oh ;0 thnx
[1:03:47] lxe322: < TriHard /
[1:03:51] Tylar_7: This might be an unpopular opinion but i think RNG shouldnt be winning as much as they should. Literally having Uzi carrying the game to worlds like come on. ( I dont watch LPL games much so my only real experience with them is on their world stage preformance.)
[1:03:51] CasterFroskurinn: @jarvitz I'm sitting in front of the desk behind the cameras in the production room with the producer. I can make faces at the casters.
[1:03:57] Sourke: Nb will 2-0 lgd CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat
[1:04:14] MortosHD: that tie is dope SeemsGood
[1:04:16] Tylar_7: hell i might be wrong lately uzi might be trash idk
[1:04:25] Tylar_7: thats just what i see tho
[1:04:26] jarvitz: @casterfroskurinn lol. you should troll them or something
[1:04:29] cantspeel: i heard rumors that the lpl production room is lit fire.....
[1:04:42] cantspeel: i think uzi said that last night
[1:04:42] Rumblextristana: TriHard DatSheffy ArgieB8 desk
[1:04:53] CasterFroskurinn: @NPSpartan I would agree with that. I think RNG get to skate by simply because they have basics: this is how you play around spikes. This is how you set up a side wave. But nothing advanced. It scares me for international play.
[1:04:53] Surfinerd: no, the caster ar too hot that's all KappaPride
[1:05:02] seekndtroy: black chinese PogChamp
[1:05:07] lxe322: @CasterFroskurinn, You guys should do behind the scenes one day <3

[1:05:26] burnswin: mom BabyRage
[1:05:34] CasterFroskurinn: @lxe322 when I win my Lgd bet, the production room will also be forced to wear wigs.
[1:05:46] uzi_in_2017: Kreygasm UZI in S4
[1:05:50] poorardia: @CasterFroskurinn any reason we should still believe in lgd?
[1:06:00] Admiralcholo: LGD NotLikeThis
[1:06:01] alexsmendoza27: because imp u.u
[1:06:02] Sourke: Lgd seems hit or miss sometimes
[1:06:05] CasterFroskurinn: @rexraptor10 they're LGD and this is the LPL. Can you believe in OMG/SS/IM?
[1:06:13] Tylar_7: At least i'm not alone on this, if Uzi is the only rock for the team and nothing else is even close to him, i dont get how RNG doesnt get punished for it
[1:06:16] seekndtroy: Travis Gafford twin brother
[1:06:18] kazisqo: Dom casts LPL? WutFace
[1:06:18] OMGScootsRIP: NO PULSE? NO FROSK? FeelsGoodMan
[1:06:19] lxe322: @CasterFroskurinn, Lol I know nothing about that bet but I hope it happens!
[1:06:28] jarvitz: reminder LGD lost to 0-12 EU team
[1:06:40] seekndtroy: Travis Gafford on LPL LOL
[1:06:50] Admiralcholo: Lol when they were good tho
[1:06:52] CasterFroskurinn: @Liudotwenson6969 WE and RNG look solid - not amazing. But not terrible. WE need to smash OMG here to solidify my hope.
[1:06:54] KHRON1C: @CasterFroskurinn what do you think of QG sliding down in the standings and where do they sit in you opion?
[1:06:55] shapoppi: next match!
[1:07:03] shapoppi: @CasterFroskurinn, where is dade?
[1:07:11] THEchanllenger: miss old OMG and LMQ lol
[1:07:13] CasterFroskurinn: @Legendary_platypus QG should open up a charity with all these games they're donating.
[1:07:19] CasterFroskurinn: @shapoppi No longer in the LPL
[1:07:21] KHRON1C: ^

[1:08:53] Sourke: @casterfroskurinn any thoughts on the new galio?
[1:08:53] THEchanllenger: SMLZ is one of a kind
[1:09:14] CasterFroskurinn: @Sourke I hate facing him in solo queue. If he's on my team he feeds. Enemy team and he blasts my ass.
[1:09:26] Tylar_7: I better be seeing that dunkmaster galio skin
[1:09:27] fernandoliore: donde esta bengi ?

[1:11:41] CasterFroskurinn: @Liudotwenson6969 I spent a lot of time with the top 3 EU teams at IEM. They've improved since then, but they restored my confidence in the LPL actually. lololol

[1:14:45] Tylar_7: When @CasterFroskurinn gets girls ez when i cant get anyone
[1:14:46] CasterFroskurinn: @Hi_ImPhantomere Their mid game shot calling - they rely too much on their individual skills to win matches such as Scout or Mouse overperforming. Their macro and tempo game is terrible and lost. So they either steamrole in lanes and then use lane assingments to abuse; or win super late in 5v5 because their individual members press buttons better. But nothing is won these days off better strategy.

[1:24:44] 오르티: lee used flash as well
[1:24:46] CasterFroskurinn: @NPSpartan We don't have a live audience - so we can't feed off energy like the NA casters can from a crowd. It's a completely different cast. Likewise, we try to be more "late night league" style

[1:25:39] CasterFroskurinn: @Alucard_1749 We don't have control of the overlays in game - Riot China does. They pop keystones at the beginning of game, but I'll pass along the feedback. I like how LCK has them next to Summoner Spells

[1:26:01] trollmonius: I have a question are there more or less koreans in LPL atm ??
[1:26:12] uzi_in_2017: bronze do better SwiftRage

[1:26:15] SylvrPoint: Royal has full China tho
[1:26:17] seiniel: there are less
[1:26:32] CasterFroskurinn: @NPSpartan I actually find it easier to cast with a crowd. Because you don't have to "fake" energy and get it naturally. But everyone is different.
[1:26:41] KHRON1C: max 2 kr per team
[1:26:46] trollmonius: yeah it seems comparing to last year i havent watched LPL this year so far
[1:27:00] 오르티: Koreans are returning to Korea to win World championship now
[1:27:09] Some_Kinda_forsenCD: fake cmonBruh
[1:27:09] KappaFrankerZXD: @CasterFroskurinn u should have twitch chat up while u cast Kappa
[1:27:10] CasterFroskurinn: Also the main LPL audience ELO is higher than the average NALCS viewer. So we try to be more indepth analytical because we expect the audience knows more as a baseline.
[1:27:18] bestvijapan: o.O
[1:27:20] KHRON1C: collected their fat checks and bust their *** back to kr
[1:27:22] Voltiate: @CasterFroskurinn I know you don't have a crowd, but do you even get audio of the crowd from China?

[1:28:17] Tylar_7: @CasterFroskurinn, ive done alot of work with teaching high school kids public speaking and what ive noticed is if your comfortable with the people around you so i can see most LPL casters doing ok as long as they are familiar with each other

[1:41:36] FishRoeSoup: btw, is there any updates on s6 champion skins?
[1:41:37] Tylar_7: @CasterFroskurinn, so they are longer, i already have the advantage

[2:14:25] CasterFroskurinn: Krepo is such a nice guy. When I cast with him at Worlds I was so nervous and he took me out to breakfast to just chill me out. Gave me great feedback and was so kind.

[3:08:11] CasterFroskurinn: @Alviss144 I disagree. I think Pulse actually has a great voice for it - in fact of everyone on our team, I think he and Raz have the best natural voices
[3:08:23] lealkid: What happened to EDG? @casterfroskurinn
[3:08:28] CasterFroskurinn: @Alviss144 But it's all very subjective in that preference.

[3:09:36] Admiralcholo: @sparkyyyyyyyyyyy :-(
[3:09:38] BootOfficiaI: my mama told me
[3:09:39] CasterFroskurinn: I think Pulse suffered because he was so young when he made his debut with his pony tail and it's just really easy to pick on him. He's the weeb kid from school that got picked last in school and no matter how much improvement he makes, people just won't overlook the meme. That said, there is moderate and real feedback to give, but the general hate is overblown for how much he's improved.

[4:03:28] rofflepie: rng 2-0 flashwolf at MSI, IMAY 2-0 flash wolf at worlds, when was the last time flash wolf even won against an LPL team
[4:04:08] VG_Guest: @rofflepie this year FW looks better and LPL looks a lot worse
[4:04:29] DarKayserLeo: who said trihard?
[4:04:35] rshawer: @terrorsq I know you said every, but that word is entirely irrelevant, of the only one with any traction or relevance is espns
[4:04:47] byterover: Trihard
[4:04:54] rshawer: @terrorsq but if you want to be pedantic, then I apologize for misunderstanding
[4:04:58] rofflepie: mata was *** in lane during his last few month at RNG, they got a lane upgrade and MAYBE a macro downgrade, looper is average at best, letme isntgreat but the all chinese is definately an upgrade
[4:05:24] rshawer: @terrorsq make me ***
[4:05:34] rshawer: Lol

[4:07:47] SylvrPoint: Music WutFace
[4:07:48] rofflepie: letme speaking chinese is better than looper speaking korean, looper is better but not good enough to say having a chinese toplaner isnt better for the team
[4:07:59] rofflepie: its not u r switching a god of toplane to letme
[4:08:28] goblinguy01: Way
[4:08:31] rshawer: @terrorsq he used the word but, which to me implies that letme isn't great and not an upgrade, but since he speaks Chinese, it makes up for it
[4:08:40] goblinguy01: Wait*. Newbee won somehow
[4:09:06] rshawer: @terrorsq but no I don't agree with looper being average, I think he's fine, but his best skills are enabled with maya
[4:09:42] vincentljyp: ROFL have you ever watched RNG's game
[4:09:57] rofflepie: looper wouldnt be a top 4 toplaner in any of the 4 major regions right now, just by himself, he is doing fine in EF but he is not better than any of the other korea imports
[4:09:58] rshawer: @terrorsq worse means suddenly worse than FW? You can be worse but still better than some other team
[4:10:27] SylvrPoint: Benched FeelsBadMan
[4:10:55] rshawer: Ok, but RNG was much better FW at worlds, so I'm not sure if the gap is even made up
[4:10:55] goblinguy01: I don't think FW are that good
[4:10:58] vincentljyp: FW lost 0-2 to 3rd team in LPL
[4:11:04] vincentljyp: IM almost lost to WE
[4:11:04] rofflepie: i dont know how you can definitively say FW got better and lpl got worse just from IEM
[4:11:10] mmktyler: LOL Eimy
[4:11:18] goblinguy01: FW can beat LCK but lose to LPL...
[4:11:42] rshawer: @terrorsq we certainly didn't finish that argument, so we definitely didn't finding he debate BrokeBack
[4:11:57] rofflepie: nothing from FW's past suggest they can definately beat top lpl teams, even when they were winning against korea
[4:12:08] naturally679: MingLee vs MingLee
[4:12:14] rofflepie: same as AHQ, lms teams just doesnt match well against lpl
[4:12:16] vincentljyp: @Terrorsq Ok now figured out youre just trolling
[4:12:41] goblinguy01: Even EDG testing against AHQ. LMQ can't beat LpL
[4:12:50] goblinguy01: FW can't beat RNG Kappa
[4:12:55] vincentljyp: RNG
[4:12:56] SylvrPoint: Imp from World Champ to this LUL
[4:13:23] vincentljyp: RNG's adc won syndra 1v1 against FW's mid FailFish
[4:13:24] rshawer: @terrorsq LMS can play much better than China against Korea or Europe, but matched up FW can't beat Chinese teams, its style issue
[4:13:30] goblinguy01: That's like Africa and LGD would be top 3 in NA
[4:13:52] rshawer: I typed in Google for power rankings and got all espn
[4:13:56] goblinguy01: Did you people forgot that Uzi is still best ADC in China
[4:13:58] KappaFrankerZXD: WE & RNG would put up a good fight against FW. It definitely wouldn't be a stomp.
[4:14:04] rofflepie: and i would take the current RNG (assuming mlxg is playing) over worlds rng any day
[4:14:06] rshawer: So which other one beside the terrible espn ranking are you referencing
[4:14:09] SylvrPoint: No more Akali Mid please, just aim for staples FailFish
[4:14:10] rofflepie: so no they didnt get worse
[4:14:16] SylvrPoint: Akali Top****
[4:14:19] rshawer: I can't search google for every obscure power ranking in existence
[4:15:18] goblinguy01: Let's see at MSI
[4:15:28] goblinguy01: What LPL team will stomp LOS
[4:15:50] vincentljyp: Who the F evaluate teams according to ranking LMAO
[4:16:08] goblinguy01: AHQ is EDG sister, and can't beat LpL. Why?
[4:16:22] vinymox: @DanQuasar oi toptravesty
[4:16:28] PoliticalMuffin: are you guys implying that LMS and NA will make it out of the qualifier?
[4:16:48] goblinguy01: LMS will make it out of Qualifier
[4:16:56] goblinguy01: NA might lose to Soviets or Wild Card
[4:17:14] PoliticalMuffin: eu auto qualifies though
[4:17:25] rshawer: @terrorsq FW isn't even seeded in the MSI tournament 4Head 4Head 4Head
[4:17:40] SylvrPoint: Syndra inc ResidentSleeper
[4:17:42] rshawer: LMS didn't earn a direct seed
[4:17:43] goblinguy01: Why is LMS getting punished? NA deserved so play with wildcards
[4:18:16] rshawer: Cuz they only pick three with EU, KR and CN being the three best performers when you evaluate last years world and MSI
[4:18:21] SylvrPoint: Naut DansGame
[4:18:30] goblinguy01: EU, if you mean G2-8? No
[4:18:33] VG_Guest: @youkai111 that's quite hold. I said same thing last year and G2 happened.

[4:18:49] vincentljyp: So IM 2-0 against FW when they were 7th in powerranking and IM was 11st Kappa jack off to your power rankings

[4:19:27] goblinguy01: At IEM, G2 won because of Mickey throw
[4:19:27] rofflepie: FW lost to IM playing a mid laner in the jungle and a jungler supporting
[4:19:33] goblinguy01: Not because of G2 skill
[4:19:38] rshawer: Look at us plebs arguing about which team can win second place, when Korea is just going to stomp everyone

[4:20:15] vincentljyp: IMAY got an upgrade on roster and FW remains the same Kappa and FW suddenly can beat IM good logic
[4:20:19] goblinguy01: Is TSM going to win NA lol
[4:20:35] VG_Guest: @vincentljyp FW has better ADC
[4:20:38] 0401050: imp has on his cartier opticals. cost like 2k lol. better win 4Head
[4:20:45] rshawer: @kappafrankerzxd it does dipshit, never said I didn't, it's a funny observation.

[4:21:39] SylvrPoint: Infernal First Drag DansGame
[4:22:15] rofflepie: the real reason FW got better is not because of NL, NL was always bad, they had kramer before too, the real reason is because MMD is no longer feeding or going even, he can now carry sometimes
[4:22:41] 0401050: Fw is basically korea #2
[4:23:01] VG_Guest: @dakota_88 NO.

[4:25:26] 抗吧凌风: they have, he is called funny, but funny is playing top now
[4:25:29] rshawer: Since Bebe wants to carry and have the team play around him
[4:25:46] goblinguy01: Bebe is good but he needs a good team
[4:25:54] goblinguy01: How come Bebe doesn't go to AHQ

[4:28:21] 0401050: Swift sucks
[4:28:32] rofflepie: all the chinese fprum posts are saying swift feeds on purpose when cool is playing, like last week cool's tf game
[4:28:42] rofflepie: cause he wants coco to play

[4:31:00] demiurggermanec247: @goblibguy01 he's likely to be sick
[4:31:00] rshawer: @terrorsq ok, I concede that a guy from eyclypsia agrees with you. But he doesn't convince me, and since you don't actually give me reasons besides the authors conclusion, it's not a real argument
[4:31:02] rofflepie: and baybay got replaced by a streamer
[4:31:30] 0401050: mlxg lung cancer
