[1:19:25] PulseIRL: @remystar47 Don't quote me as it's not my place to say but afaik it's due to the fact that the NA playerbase is tiny in comparison to other regions

[2:14:16] GrisBauer: Cassio and ekko open, but lets pick viktor ResidentSleeper
[2:14:24] mrkenndy: how the heck isnt it kog? is the ashe arrow that much better in pro?
[2:14:39] Snipawolfe: comfort pick imo
[2:14:40] GrisBauer: No, its just they feel better playing ashe here
[2:15:05] GrisBauer: Maybe they dont play kog
[2:15:21] Snipawolfe: They should. Kog at botrk/guinsoo's is hands down the best ADC right now
[2:15:24] Griech: Dat beard Kappa
[2:15:31] GrisBauer: Guinsoo its bretty bad
[2:15:44] ShadowingSin: Best ADC in soloqueue, harder to pull off in comp.
[2:15:45] GrisBauer: Bork into tryforce
[2:15:54] noodle_soupi: QG just go mr, then gg
[2:16:02] noodle_soupi: ashe useless dmg
[2:16:04] GrisBauer: or bork into runnan
[2:16:13] alexsmendoza27: comeee oooon i want to watch Uzi
[2:16:19] ShadowingSin: Granted, I think this is probably a teamcomp that benefits kog, but he's by no means some god-tier in competitive
[2:16:20] GrisBauer: Na ashe its ok for the peel comp
[2:16:27] GrisBauer: Just kog its better
[2:17:18] Snipawolfe: triforce is trash on Kog right now. Guinsoo's gives him an average of 10.5% max HP life per auto attack while his W is up. That's not even counting the 22.5 average magic damage, his AD, botrk proccing for 12% average current life
[2:17:22] GrisBauer: No because sivir isnt powerful has ashe with 1st item bork
[2:17:40] ShadowingSin: Triforce isn't trash, it's safer
[2:17:42] rebeccamo: no smite PogChamp
[2:17:43] GrisBauer: Besides ashe has pick potential and sivir. well.
[2:18:21] mrkenndy: i wouldnt go sivir

[2:22:15] Snipawolfe: Viktor gets beat to death by the meta mids atm. Zz1tai is just getting outlaned early on a lane bully

[2:22:44] chatspam_vohiyo: Kappa
[2:22:49] GillesDerai: y no ban Zzitai?
[2:22:51] GrisBauer: Everylaner actually is a lane bully. and viktor its pretty bad against the 5-6 picks that are good atm
[2:23:21] papasullyc: so why play him?
[2:23:40] GrisBauer: Cuz he is safe on that champ? and maybe his pool is shit.
[2:23:58] papasullyc: Fair enough
[2:23:59] rebeccamo: maybe because 45k last match Kappa
[2:24:14] GrisBauer: Yea
[2:24:20] GrisBauer: 45k. Cant lane right now lol
[2:24:21] ShadowingSin: Viktor is like a more assassin-y orianna
[2:24:31] ShadowingSin: good teamfighter with waveclear, juts a little less utility and a little more burst
[2:24:50] GrisBauer: orianna is safer to play and has combos
[2:25:10] GillesDerai: is Flandre chinese?
[2:25:13] ShadowingSin: Viktor does too, with a lot more damage potential
[2:25:13] GrisBauer: This *** has to be close and his utiilty is nearby to none.
[2:25:42] Snipawolfe: His scaling is pretty good and he wrecks messy teamfights. If he goes Lich bane he can pop ADCs with E/Q/auto.
[2:25:57] Snipawolfe: Ori is legit almost the same champ just safer and more dangerous from further away with her ult.
[2:26:03] ShadowingSin: Viktor's lane presence is better than orianna's too, just less safe
[2:26:04] GrisBauer: Well. if he gets closer to an adc like to do that.
[2:26:23] ShadowingSin: Listen, you can compare all you want, but there's logical, viable reasons to choose viktor over other champs
[2:26:27] GrisBauer: I disagree. Viktor is more risky and has less reward.
[2:27:03] jolimba: holy
[2:27:06] GrisBauer: Te only reason a team need to pick it is because the player wants to use it and he feels safe. So with taht being said any argument is invalid lol
[2:27:13] GrisBauer: The*
[2:27:25] ShadowingSin: you can't just say an argument is invalid because you disagree with it lol
[2:27:49] Snipawolfe: He's saying the argument is invalid if Doinb values Vik over other pics
[2:27:54] Snipawolfe: *picks
[2:28:03] GrisBauer: Emm i didnt said that. I said we can compare all the *** we want. But he played it cuz he is safe on the champ not the kit on it.
[2:28:06] ShadowingSin: there were multiple other reasons to pick viktor, you just chose to ignore them to say "lul safe pick"
[2:28:13] GrisBauer: Exactly what snipa said.
[2:28:40] GrisBauer: But the other reasons makes viktor inviable. since there are champs that do what he do and better.
[2:28:58] ShadowingSin: see, that's where you're making an assumption that that statement is correct
[2:29:20] uzi_in_2017: dead chat LPL WutFace
[2:29:36] ShadowingSin: Viktor may be outclassed on specific styles, but he isn't outclassed universally by any champion
[2:29:40] GrisBauer: I dont understand ur englando LUL
[2:30:01] mrkenndy: ok @zoomenhanced go watch lck lol
[2:30:10] GrisBauer: Yes he is dude. Thats why he is not a priority pick.
[2:30:20] GrisBauer: And its more a safe poket pick
[2:30:23] noodle_soupi: ResidentSleeper
[2:30:27] ShadowingSin: Not being a priority pick doesn't mean he doesn't have his uses, lol
[2:30:51] GrisBauer: i didnt said he dont have uses i said that its not strong like to be priority
[2:30:53] mrkenndy: @zoomenhanced OH u actually wer ebeing helpful sorry not use to the 1% of lol chat lol
[2:31:01] ShadowingSin: now that's a totally separate arguement
[2:31:14] GrisBauer: and the only reason to pick it over orianna is because the player feels comfortable
[2:31:15] Snipawolfe: I wouldn't say Vik is outclassed universally but I would say someone like Ori is better in almost every way except for ez-pz waveclear
[2:31:41] yoooyaaac: LPL 4Head

[4:54:45] PulseIRL: @plasticspoonn Somehow spliced together from the essence of memes
[4:54:51] Krincy: Dom improved so much imo
[4:55:10] plasticspoonn: lol
[4:55:11] sakura_chain: @搞个大新闻 they paid for that side

[4:57:33] rodricide: RNG comp ResidentSleeper
[4:57:37] 搞个大新闻: @sakura_chain Actually no audio delay in my place
[4:57:51] noggywoggy: Orianna > Syndra as blind pick
[4:58:45] nezzqi: caster not just going with what she's saying and making it awkward af for her and himself..
[4:58:48] 搞个大新闻: RNG gonna lose
[4:59:01] sakura_chain: @搞个大新闻 i nnoticed the delay is only in game. the casters mouth were in sync
[4:59:16] Merk3nz: Orianna > Syndra most of the time right? Khan and Gragas makes the pick even better.
[4:59:19] ESTEpo: i also had an audio delay Sakura, i stoped paying attention at it a while ago
