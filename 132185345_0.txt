[3:51:32] KappaFrankerZXD: its dumb luck
[3:51:38] halloderbaer: naut support is just not tanky enough
[3:51:46] KappaFrankerZXD: it should be changed so only junglers can finish objectives
[3:51:54] KappaFrankerZXD: with smite
[3:52:01] halloderbaer: why? its part of the game that anyone can do it
[3:52:17] halloderbaer: its completely normal that adc solo dagons for example
[3:52:36] Vashnaroth: If the jungler had smite and LZ had control on the Baron and they still got it stolen
[3:52:39] KappaFrankerZXD: yeah part of the game doesnt mean its good... donald trump supporters are part of this world too.. is that good?
[3:52:43] Vashnaroth: It's their fault, not the Nami's
[3:53:12] halloderbaer: its a good part of the game. you can control it easily like @Vashnaroth said and if you fail you deserve it

[3:53:38] sasha_ermokhin: Ky
[3:54:04] KappaFrankerZXD: nah if u want to move the game away from RNG you need to remove the potential for *** sunfire cape steals and nami bubble steals
[3:54:12] rebeccamo: tali dmg Kreygasm
[3:54:29] chomi21: To make the game interesting you need to have the potential for comebacks
[3:54:53] chomi21: Baron steals makes it possible to make big comebacks
[3:55:13] KappaFrankerZXD: it is stupid, LZ are the better team, KDM are trash yet they won because they got lucky
[3:55:21] KappaFrankerZXD: that is not good
[3:55:27] KappaFrankerZXD: or interesting
[3:55:29] chomi21: The first game LZ had no chance really
[3:55:54] chomi21: So you cannot say the series was not competitive
[3:55:54] gnilebatHD: this guy ... lets remove "RNG" ... bubble steal is not RNG its a missplay by the jungler you donkey :D
[3:56:10] chomi21: Luck is a part of any sport
[3:56:22] KappaFrankerZXD: or healthy for the game
[3:56:28] chomi21: It's like removing hail maries from american football
[3:56:48] chomi21: Dude... The best team doesn't always win
[3:56:50] vincentljyp: I stole baron with 98 damage nami q once in low d soloq Kappa
[3:56:54] chomi21: That's what makes sports interesting to watch
[3:56:57] vincentljyp: Kappa and still lost
[3:56:59] KappaFrankerZXD: they go on about competitive integrity, a nami stealing a baron and winning the game from 4k deficit because of that baron is not competitive integrity
[3:57:06] kokichat: annie?? 4Head
[3:57:11] chomi21: Of course it is
[3:57:12] Vashnaroth: Oh shut up you're just mad salty
[3:57:21] chomi21: You're too butthurt dude
[3:57:24] KappaFrankerZXD: lol.... the reason they implemented BO3's to get the best team winning the series
[3:57:34] chomi21: No
[3:57:37] telenorbanditten: HotPokket MY TURN
[3:57:39] KappaFrankerZXD: so there goes that argument
[3:57:46] chomi21: That is incorrect
[3:57:54] KappaFrankerZXD: no, it isn't.
[3:57:55] chomi21: BO3 was made to make the better team win more often
[3:58:15] molly___cyrus: you must be trolling, no one can be that dense 4Head
[3:58:18] Vashnaroth: Practice your burst+smite with the team and do not fail execution that badly
[3:58:36] gnilebatHD: love these no and yes arguments that are just opinions thrown around
[3:58:42] KappaFrankerZXD: that is what I'm saying you idiot
[3:58:51] chomi21: If you took out all elements of surprise elements in sports, why would anyone watch them?
[3:58:53] KappaFrankerZXD: the ideal world is where the best team wins every time
[3:58:54] Vashnaroth: Or idk buy Condi as your jungler and just let him smite his way to the top
[3:59:12] KappaFrankerZXD: what don't you *** understand about that?
[3:59:13] chomi21: Here's a fun fact for you... We don't live in an ideal world
[3:59:22] chomi21: People make mistakes, and that's part of sports
[3:59:31] KappaFrankerZXD: holy *** kid, obviously, that's why you take steps to get closer to that ideal world
[3:59:41] hilfekiste: Sports would be irrelevant if noone made mistakes
[3:59:44] KappaFrankerZXD: what are you even trying to fcukijgn say?
[3:59:48] chomi21: So you want a world where the best team wins in 100% of the cases?
[3:59:53] KappaFrankerZXD: no shit.
[4:00:01] KappaFrankerZXD: that is what the goal is
[4:00:10] Vashnaroth: That would be the most boring world possible
[4:00:10] KappaFrankerZXD: that is literally the definition of competitive integrity
[4:00:13] chomi21: I'm trying to make you understand that your "ideal world" would be completely uninteresting and make sports vanish
[4:00:32] KappaFrankerZXD: ok??? it might be boring but it is the only logical option if they want to deliver on "competitive integrity"
[4:00:34] chomi21: God damn
[4:00:46] KappaFrankerZXD: and it wouldn't be boring for people who actually think logically
[4:01:01] Vashnaroth: I mean there are sports like rugby where the best team almost always wins due to the nature of the game but upsets are still a thing and extremely entertaining
[4:01:22] chomi21: Upsets makes sports interesting, and that's what people want to see
[4:01:27] chomi21: Sports is entertainment
[4:01:35] chomi21: And where is the entertainment with no upsets?
[4:01:35] Vashnaroth: And if you're the better team you shouldn't make absurd mistakes like getting Baron stolen by a Nami...
[4:01:44] KappaFrankerZXD: are you kidding?
[4:01:56] gnilebatHD: TRIGGERED
[4:02:00] chomi21: xD
[4:02:03] gnilebatHD: SeemsGood
[4:02:08] KappaFrankerZXD: seeing a team play well and execute on plans crisply is what makes games entertaining
[4:02:14] KappaFrankerZXD: not seeing a garbage team get an undeserved win
[4:02:19] chomi21: That's also entertaining
[4:02:31] chomi21: Watching a team make a huge mistake and fail is also entertainment
[4:02:37] KappaFrankerZXD: no
[4:02:43] chomi21: It's the unpredictability that makes it entertaining
[4:02:47] hilfekiste: Yes it is
[4:02:52] hilfekiste: Just in another way
[4:02:54] KappaFrankerZXD: maybe to idiots
[4:03:04] Vashnaroth: Didn't Kongdoo 2-1 KT last week?
[4:03:08] chomi21: Well, then you clearly have an extremely narrow understanding of what entertainment is
[4:03:25] hilfekiste: Two perfect teams playing against each other would easily become very stale
[4:03:48] KappaFrankerZXD: except you have to strike a balance between competitive integrity and entertainment
[4:03:58] KappaFrankerZXD: you are completely ignoring the need for competitive integrity
[4:04:00] chomi21: Of course... I can agree with that
[4:04:05] KappaFrankerZXD: to suit your shitty argument
[4:04:10] chomi21: XD
[4:04:32] hilfekiste: The reason why the best teams are still entertaining when playing each other, is because they can capitalize on the few mistakes the other team makes
[4:04:34] chomi21: Your argument goes like this: make LoL like I want it, because I'm the only one who knows that entertainment is, and everybody else are idiots"
[4:04:36] KappaFrankerZXD: a bad team winning a series is not entertaining, it is cringe worthy
[4:05:02] chomi21: You just cannot say that
[4:05:08] KappaFrankerZXD: except a nami bubble stealing baron is not one of those things
[4:05:18] KappaFrankerZXD: that is just straight cancer
[4:05:23] chomi21: I found that very entertaining
[4:05:26] Silv3rStr3ak: kappa got hypersalty over nothing, chill...
[4:05:35] chomi21: And that made me wanna watch more LoL
[4:05:52] gnilebatHD: why do you think all the YouTube cringe videos are being clicked so much?
[4:05:56] KappaFrankerZXD: well i feel sorry for you if you find a fking nami bubble stealing the baron and winning the worse team the series entertaining
[4:06:00] hilfekiste: It gives moments of excitement when steals like those happen
[4:06:03] KappaFrankerZXD: because idiots outnumber smart people
[4:06:28] chomi21: So we should also have ended the Super Bowl when the Falcons were leading by 20 points?
[4:06:38] hilfekiste: And you are the smarter person here?
[4:06:42] chomi21: Because it would be "unfair" to let New England have a chance?
[4:06:51] KappaFrankerZXD: evidently
[4:06:57] Silv3rStr3ak: Why do you assume only idiots enjoy something?
[4:06:59] telenorbanditten: How does gambling work in ur world?
[4:06:59] KappaFrankerZXD: no, it wouldn't be unfair
[4:07:05] chomi21: This guy xD
[4:07:10] Vashnaroth: Guys, don't, it's a salty fan, he ain't even listening to you
[4:07:13] KappaFrankerZXD: that is disgusting false equivalency
[4:07:24] gnilebatHD: r/iamverysmart
[4:07:26] chomi21: I didn't make an equivalency
[4:07:37] chomi21: I was asking a question
[4:07:41] KappaFrankerZXD: what a disgusting comparison, super bowl to league of legends game
[4:07:46] KappaFrankerZXD: holy shit...
[4:07:50] chomi21: To see how far you wanna take this argument
[4:08:14] KappaFrankerZXD: no, obviously they shouldn't have *** stopped the super bowl game because teams factor in fatigue to their game plan
[4:08:18] chomi21: Can I ask you something? Did you lose money on that game?
[4:08:20] KappaFrankerZXD: what a retarded *** argument
[4:08:29] chomi21: It wasn't an argument
[4:08:29] Vashnaroth: Huh, braum into Lulu with Karma and malzahar open
[4:08:37] chomi21: I thought you would be smart enough to see that
[4:08:47] KappaFrankerZXD: league of legends teams, however, don't factor in a *** nami bubble steal securing baron for them and winning the game
[4:08:53] Vashnaroth: LPL teams don't value Malza that much or is it just these teams?
[4:08:56] KappaFrankerZXD: and rightly so
[4:08:59] kingswenxarr: talking about hyper carries, why didnt u mention kogmow
[4:09:08] vincentljyp: malz is bad against lulu
[4:09:23] xcpn: LULU is Malz's counter pick? Who is stupid to pick Malz vs a LULU
[4:09:35] Moobot: No long messages allowed (br0x1gar) (warning)
[4:09:37] Vashnaroth: In lane yea, but with Ashe Maokai you get sick picks later
[4:10:13] Vashnaroth: Also the Braum into double ranged struggles so much
[4:10:30] KappaFrankerZXD: anyone else have any garbage arguments that they want destroyed?
[4:10:41] chomi21: Destroyed xD
[4:10:56] chomi21: Can you tell me at which point you destroyed any of my arguments? xD
[4:11:09] KappaFrankerZXD: literally all of them
[4:11:14] chomi21: Wow
[4:11:18] KappaFrankerZXD: go scroll up
[4:11:20] chomi21: Good job man
[4:11:39] chomi21: You were merely telling me your opinion of what an ideal world is to you
[4:11:46] Vashnaroth: Duke Trundle WHEN, IG please
[4:11:49] chomi21: And I was trying to let you know that nobody wants to have that
[4:12:06] Vashnaroth: PSA: Don't feed the salty troll please
[4:12:07] chomi21: There would be no viewers
[4:12:18] chomi21: There would be no reason to watch League of Legends
[4:12:36] KappaFrankerZXD: that's absolutely hilarious
[4:12:47] chomi21: Yeah, I'll stop talking to this troll now
[4:12:56] KappaFrankerZXD: that you think that without cancerous nami bubble steals nobody would watch league of legends
[4:13:17] KappaFrankerZXD: i don't know if you're retarded or so entrenched in your position that you don't want to admit being so disgustingly wrong
[4:13:38] Vashnaroth: What a sick gank holy moly
[4:13:46] Ïû≠Ïû≠Ïû≠Ïû≠: marge and homer? Kappa
[4:14:59] Vashnaroth: Oh boy double buff cass
[4:15:01] Miitniick: rng won ?
[4:15:03] KappaFrankerZXD: i would have $15,000 extra if cancerous RNG didn't exist
[4:15:06] Vashnaroth: Talon's gonna have so much fun
[4:15:09] vincentljyp: @Miitniick yes
[4:15:17] Miitniick: uzi op
[4:15:23] hilfekiste: That kinda answered the question :)
[4:15:25] vincentljyp: uzi was out
[4:15:33] Miitniick: oow boy lul
[4:16:05] KappaFrankerZXD: is duke brain dead? lmao
[4:16:48] vincentljyp: duke the triple dorans tilt
[4:17:01] Vashnaroth: Eh, it's decent enought for laning
[4:17:29] Vashnaroth: Also doesn't need that many tank stats right now in the top lane MU so he's safe to go dorans
[4:17:40] Vashnaroth: As long as Flawless doesn't repeat gank a lot
[4:18:39] spam_the_wut_face: NA Cannon
[4:18:44] Barataah: na catapa
[4:18:46] Ocsword: Kappa
[4:18:49] Nagly17: cass roa?
[4:19:09] arlanar06: I hadn't heard that cait builds bork now first O.o
[4:19:27] Ocsword: botrk is core on many ADs now
[4:19:43] KappaFrankerZXD: that wasn't what happened FailFish
[4:19:52] spam_the_wut_face: wtf
[4:20:00] uzi_in_2017: remake
[4:20:00] Ocsword: Ashe lucian Kalista and maybe others like twitch and vayne
[4:20:04] arlanar06: I know its core on many ads, but I didnt think cait benefitted as well from it as ashe or luc
[4:20:12] Vashnaroth: Maybe he'll build Cutlass first then go for other items
[4:20:23] trisssmerigold: how far will LPL go this year??
[4:20:29] Vashnaroth: Just for the sustain and active, like I think Bang did yesterday on Ezreal
[4:20:36] Ocsword: well Ashe and Cait have a lot in common to me
[4:20:44] KappaFrankerZXD: lmao
[4:20:55] arlanar06: I suppose since he has died once it helps him survive but cait doesn't deal as well with such a delayed power spike i feel
[4:20:57] KappaFrankerZXD: they're pixels bro
[4:21:30] Osteoid: Marge always gets Asche LUL
[4:21:32] ESTEpo: PogChamp
[4:21:34] spam_the_wut_face: Tank ResidentSleeper
[4:21:58] KappaFrankerZXD: unpractices rookie cass
[4:22:03] KappaFrankerZXD: d*
[4:22:06] Vashnaroth: No idea how Cait works with BotRK, but can't be that much worse than going BFSword into Zeal item
[4:22:35] arlanar06: Its not worse in lane it gives her decent sustain, but it heavily delays her power spike
[4:22:42] Ocsword: anyway it s good to see some ADs back in the meta
[4:22:42] arlanar06: and cait's power curve is pretty harsh atm
[4:22:56] Ocsword: the Jhin-Varus-Ashe trinity was getting boring
[4:23:08] Vashnaroth: I'm a bit sad to see Jhin fall off so hard though
[4:23:24] KappaFrankerZXD: yeah im sure u loved no skill adc's
[4:23:28] Vashnaroth: Even if the nerfs to lethality were entirely justified
[4:23:35] compucrazy: \ StinkyCheese / STINKY CHEESE \ StinkyCheese /
[4:23:37] spam_the_wut_face: Lul
[4:23:38] KappaFrankerZXD: fking bad rookie cass
[4:23:41] SlyGuyWillie: FailFish
[4:24:04] Ocsword: well the Deathfire touch surely didn t help for jhin
[4:24:36] Ocsword: nerf *
[4:24:39] Vashnaroth: Yea they maybe nerfed too many things at the same time
[4:24:49] compucrazy: EU LUL
[4:24:51] arlanar06: They did hit like 3 things at once in regards to Jhin so
[4:25:43] ESTEpo: bip bup
[4:25:57] Vashnaroth: IG be like "What are wards"
[4:26:00] lukasbildy: better comp 'IG :)
[4:26:04] KappaFrankerZXD: awful trade
[4:26:07] 1TinyHerb: League?
[4:26:16] Ocsword: lol
[4:26:23] Osteoid: TP BrokeBack
[4:26:24] Ocsword: never forgetti
[4:26:25] faras6: IM should win
[4:26:53] Vashnaroth: IG still has no top side wards after 2 successful top ganks and Naut roaming mid NotLikeThis
[4:27:04] wearedondon: what happened to lpl? looks like oce
[4:27:23] Anyfas: burgelisM
[4:27:32] kingswenxarr: i really dont like this lady caster
[4:27:46] KappaFrankerZXD: sexist pig
[4:27:47] Anyfas: what is that game
[4:27:49] Ocsword: "who needs wards anyway I have damages" - your 1/8 Brand solo Q support without sighstone
[4:27:55] Vashnaroth: Huh, so it is BotRK first Cait
[4:28:29] arlanar06: Yeah not sure I like it tbh
[4:28:36] Vashnaroth: And... Cleaver ashe?
[4:28:46] arlanar06: Yeah thats fine
[4:28:47] Vashnaroth: what
[4:28:49] Anyfas: what is that
[4:28:50] Ocsword: looks like it
[4:28:54] Anyfas: gg no re
[4:28:55] DoinMyDance: You want lots of cdr on ashe
[4:29:00] vincentljyp: its called the meta
[4:29:04] DoinMyDance: it increases graves dmg as well
[4:29:16] arlanar06: thats the alternative option to trinity force which you don't really wanna build on ashe thats just how the build goes now
[4:29:28] Vashnaroth: Mmm ok
[4:29:34] KappaFrankerZXD: awful rookie cass
[4:29:41] Ocsword: same for lucian if you need items quickly, cheaper than trinity
[4:29:42] KappaFrankerZXD: once again
[4:29:54] DoinMyDance: shes a utility adc anyway
[4:30:00] arlanar06: Yeh but trinity force is a better option for lucian than ashe
[4:30:07] Anyfas: Lol
[4:30:07] Vashnaroth: Yea I guess, as long as you don't build BC on graves as well
[4:30:13] Anyfas: LOL
[4:30:18] Vashnaroth: Oh boy that's a slaughter
[4:30:24] Osteoid: Big team fight
[4:30:28] arlanar06: cait doing negative damage
[4:30:31] Ocsword: 4-1
[4:30:38] arlanar06: that bork doing work...?
[4:30:42] DoinMyDance: going BC on graves would not be bad though
[4:30:48] KappaFrankerZXD: only thing rookie can do right is ult flash, literally easiest cass combo
[4:31:06] vincentljyp: nah theres no problem of building double BC, you shred their armor faster and it benefits both ad's
[4:31:11] DoinMyDance: makes him tankier, instantly shreds when they both have it and the MS is underated
[4:31:29] Vashnaroth: Great ult by Marge getting the Talon pick early
[4:31:43] DoinMyDance: i hate
[4:31:54] DoinMyDance: hate zerkers on graves
[4:32:01] ESTEpo: ^^
[4:32:09] Vashnaroth: Maw on Graves vs 1 AP champ <thinking emoji>
[4:32:29] arlanar06: why does he have zerkers? That doesnt make sense to me O.o
[4:32:31] DoinMyDance: naut/lulu/elise all doo magic dmg
[4:32:36] halloderbaer: ü§î
[4:32:47] DoinMyDance: its not ideal but it makes some sense
[4:32:50] Osteoid: Wut is dis
[4:32:51] KappaFrankerZXD: garbage IG
[4:32:54] Ocsword: PogChamp
[4:32:55] letec29: Rookie DMG LUL
[4:32:59] ivantai329: nice
[4:33:10] arlanar06: Cait damage on duke it like poking him with a toothpick -.-
[4:33:11] Vashnaroth: And that's what early BotRK does
[4:33:19] vincentljyp: maw is just a disgusting item, you win vs ap's regardless
[4:33:20] Vashnaroth: It shreds Baron super hard
[4:33:30] arlanar06: Also why does zerkers on graves make sense? I'm confused
[4:33:35] drizzledd: ppl said that rookie was a top tier mid, tell me more delusionals
[4:33:38] DoinMyDance: it doesnt
[4:33:42] halloderbaer: cause it gives him damage?
[4:33:44] DoinMyDance: its snowball item
[4:33:48] KappaFrankerZXD: he is good on anyting not cass
[4:33:56] Ocsword: Drizzledd GodV is the world's second best midlaner
[4:34:00] Vashnaroth: It's incredibly greedy
[4:34:13] DoinMyDance: ya rookie is disgusting, having bad games never happens
[4:34:16] drizzledd: @Ocsword, whos godv ?
[4:34:20] luentong: Super villain not super hero
[4:34:32] Vashnaroth: Especially vs Talon Cait, why not go Tabis?
[4:34:33] drizzledd: @Ocsword, watching lck but this is insane
[4:34:47] KappaFrankerZXD: rookie cass is SOO BAD
[4:34:48] drizzledd: these ppl know how to tf
[4:34:50] arlanar06: Zerkers gives attack speed not damage, why does that make sense on someone like graves who is reliant on a reload mechanic
[4:34:52] cavalRy7: ROOKIE CASS SUUUUUUUCKS
[4:35:02] halloderbaer: kidkid 1vs9 FeelsBadMan
[4:35:10] KappaFrankerZXD: game would be over if rookie wasn't trash at casss
[4:35:27] KappaFrankerZXD: so many missed opportunities
[4:35:31] cavalRy7: WHY YOU KEEP PICKING CASS WHEN YOU SUCK WITH IT
[4:35:43] DoinMyDance: @Jessyjess5646 AS = more quick draws, its a snowball item, it = more dmg in skirmishes when you can just auto, its a bad team fight item however
[4:35:46] SlyGuyWillie: hes in denial
[4:36:12] cavalRy7: "DONT WORRY GUYS THAT WAS A BAD GAME I'M AMAZING WITH CASS" LUL
[4:36:17] Ocsword: Drizzledd he is a chinese midlaner, he was sometimes reffered as the 2nd or 3rd best world midlaner before Worlds 2015, but he performed poorly like the rest of his team LGD, he earned the nickname "Gold V" and is now named Wei1less
[4:36:20] letec29: Megan 3x absolutly miss play
[4:36:26] Vashnaroth: Literally no reason to pick Zerkers over Tabis/Mercs though
[4:36:45] DoinMyDance: @Vashnaroth I agree, but thats the reasoning lol
[4:36:57] Vashnaroth: Yea I know
[4:37:07] arlanar06: Ahhh ok thank you
[4:37:09] drizzledd: @Ocsword, damn, i feel like faker,crown are on a tier of their own right now specially
[4:37:28] DoinMyDance: Also why is Naut, not a priority pick, when he is so broken
[4:38:03] Ocsword: Drizzledd yeah for sure, but this was 2 years ago and back then China was considered as a really powerful region after EDG's victory over SKT at MSI
[4:38:03] DoinMyDance: @Drizzledd I feel like Crown is better then Faker right now tbh, but not by much lol
[4:38:14] telenorbanditten: The damage comes from cait
[4:38:24] luentong: MR talon not tanking damage but 6/2/6 full damage elise BibleThump
[4:38:25] arlanar06: What damage?
[4:38:29] KappaFrankerZXD: bjergsen>crown>faker
[4:38:36] telenorbanditten: Not elise
[4:38:47] cavalRy7: TSM seriously gonna win world Bjergsen clearly better than Faker
[4:38:50] Ocsword: Goldenglue>Bjergsen>Crown>Faker
[4:38:57] DoinMyDance: @Ocsword Godv was insane that whole season besides worlds, its a shame he fell off so hard
[4:39:04] drizzledd: @rivenmywaifulh, now he is performing better but if you compare all the spring, faker stats are better
[4:39:07] Vashnaroth: Midlet > Goldenglue though
[4:39:12] halloderbaer: honestly, I feel like TSM is right at the level of SKT1 and Origin atm
[4:39:23] arlanar06: LOL
[4:39:26] SlyGuyWillie: thats what everyone said last year
[4:39:27] Ocsword: rivenmywaifulh yes just like imp too
[4:39:32] arlanar06: SKT1 and Origin xD
[4:39:33] SlyGuyWillie: and look how that turned out lol
[4:40:05] KappaFrankerZXD: IG may aswell ff with their dogshit decision making
[4:40:05] green1: cass build NotLikeThis
[4:40:06] cavalRy7: FROSK TRIGGERED HotPokket
[4:40:08] LeckoTUT: How is IG si bad
[4:40:11] vincentljyp: lulu op
[4:40:12] luentong: HotPokket What is that HotPokket
[4:40:13] cavalRy7: LOL
[4:40:25] Ocsword: Midglet and DoubleLift moving to TL is the most unexpected move to me lol
[4:40:26] DoinMyDance: @Drizzledd Yeah but I honestly attribute that more to SKT then too Faker, and thats not to be taken offensively
[4:40:51] DoinMyDance: @Ocsword I loved that team, they had so much potential
[4:40:53] drizzledd: @rivenmywaifulh, you have to take in account that faker is more of a shotcaller
[4:40:57] cavalRy7: ROOKIE INTING AT LPL GAME LUL
[4:41:16] HBCouch: i want to kill mysefl when this chick talks
[4:41:37] imezan_: chat is dead
[4:41:38] cavalRy7: CHICK? THAT'S SEXIST HotPokket
[4:41:38] luentong: HotPokket LPL is mine HotPokket
[4:41:57] Ocsword: rivenmywaifulh well this year China had big difficulties in worlds, hopefully for them RNG hopped in the following year
[4:42:23] vincentljyp: Fros is a good caster she has good knowledge about the game but her voice is making people uncomfortable
[4:42:24] HBCouch: I want to kill myself when this human being talks
[4:42:25] cavalRy7: REDEMPTION NEEDS A NERF
[4:42:29] DoinMyDance: @Drizzledd Hasn't Faker never been their shot caller? IIRC S3 it was Poo S5 it was Marin and S6 it was Wolf/Junglers
[4:42:36] Vashnaroth: Welp, onward to game 3 we go
[4:42:40] Ocsword: GG
[4:42:48] Vashnaroth: Nah Faker also shotcalls
[4:42:53] drizzledd: @rivenmywaifulh, they all shotcall, but faker talks the most
[4:43:00] cavalRy7: KT LOSING TO AFREECA 4Head EleGiggle
[4:43:05] drizzledd: marin used to call for gank etc
[4:43:15] Vashnaroth: KT broken, Monte curse confirmed
[4:43:17] DoinMyDance: Talking the most does not always = shotcalling though
[4:43:27] DoinMyDance: WildTurtle talks a ton
[4:43:54] luentong: BrokeBack Pawn and Deft BrokeBack
[4:43:59] DoinMyDance: Im probably not giving Faker enough credit
[4:44:01] drizzledd: @rivenmywaifulh, Who you think shotcalls in skt then ?
[4:44:04] Vashnaroth: Well Cait DID the damage
[4:44:20] arlanar06: Eventually yeah but the mid game was a bit messy
[4:44:26] telenorbanditten: Ban cait she is fkn broken
[4:44:38] DoinMyDance: i mean in an interview with bang he said it was mainly wolf
[4:44:49] drizzledd: when ?
[4:44:56] DoinMyDance: a few weeks ago idr
[4:45:02] drizzledd: i think faker confirmed he was the shotcaller
[4:45:11] drizzledd: in a interview now that i remember
[4:45:31] Vashnaroth: Maybe he shotcalls in teamfights rather than macro decisions
[4:45:51] DoinMyDance: Well thats fair, my whole point was Faker and Crown are 1A - 1B regardless how you rank them
[4:45:56] SlyGuyWillie: so...marin is playing mundo for some reason lol
[4:46:04] Vashnaroth: Mundo into Rumble?
[4:46:10] SlyGuyWillie: yep
[4:46:19] Vashnaroth: He's already tried it, not to great success tbh
[4:46:22] drizzledd: Faker on SKT‚Äôs team fights: ‚ÄúWe have two important calls to make in team fights. One is ‚Äòwe won this fight‚Äô and the other is ‚Äòwe lost this fight.‚Äô‚Äù
[4:46:24] SlyGuyWillie: going as u expect it
[4:46:25] Vashnaroth: But it is a strong counterpick
[4:46:32] drizzledd: thats what faker said
[4:46:55] SlyGuyWillie: well he just got solo killed on it so
[4:47:03] Vashnaroth: oh LUL
[4:47:07] SlyGuyWillie: lol
[4:47:21] Vashnaroth: Marin and his cheeky cheesy picks. Never change man.
[4:47:44] DoinMyDance: @Drizzledd regardless, its hard to make a 100% argument for 1 vs the other in their current forms
[4:47:52] SlyGuyWillie: doesnt help the rest of his team is shitting on themselves also right now, still early though
[4:47:56] Aubue: who won game 2
[4:48:21] DoinMyDance: @Ocsword i have not seen that much LPL this season, is anyone clear above the rest?
[4:48:21] Vashnaroth: IM
[4:48:30] drizzledd: @rivenmywaifulh, hope the best team goes to the final, afreeca,kt can upset
[4:48:36] drizzledd: and even mvp
[4:48:50] Vashnaroth: As a team you mean? RNG are the better team atm it seems
[4:49:09] l3wdahri: Who won?
[4:49:18] SlyGuyWillie: didnt kt lose to kongdoo recently?
[4:49:25] Vashnaroth: IG game 1, IM game 2
[4:49:36] Ocsword: fck accidentaly closed tab
[4:49:37] Vashnaroth: Yes they got 1-2 by Kongdoo last week
[4:49:40] Ocsword: what were u saying ? Kappa
[4:49:44] SlyGuyWillie: shame
[4:50:27] DoinMyDance: @Drizzledd I really want to see KT do well, but I just feel like even in their best forms, Mid gets slapped lol
[4:50:34] Ocsword: 2 0 RNG PogChamp
[4:50:38] DoinMyDance: @Ocsword i have not seen that much LPL this season, is anyone clear above the rest?
[4:50:39] Vashnaroth: Just rewatched the Nami baron steal in LZ last game, what a *** smite LOL
[4:51:19] chomi21: How much HP was left on Baron when Nami stole it Vashnaroth?
[4:51:30] Ocsword: rivenmywaifulh no idea, I almost never watch LPL I just watch them at worlds/MSI and IEM, aside from that I just take a quick look at the standings sometimes
[4:51:41] Vashnaroth: Something like 150 HP
[4:51:49] drizzledd: @rivenmywaifulh, i dont think pawn is the problem tbh, is the synergy in general
[4:52:13] chomi21: There was a Lulu steal on dragon recently too ,right?
[4:52:13] drizzledd: i feel like kt like too cheese with the good vision control that they have
[4:52:41] Ocsword: anyway right now RNG is first in group A, World Elite first in group B
[4:52:58] Vashnaroth: Baron had 226 hp left after the Smite with Nami bubble animation in the air
[4:52:58] Ocsword: now I'm off, later guys enjoy game 3
[4:53:02] DoinMyDance: @Drizzledd I do agree that Pawn is not the issue
[4:53:21] DoinMyDance: But Pawn will get clapped by Crown/Faker 95% of the time
[4:53:26] Vashnaroth: Bye @Ocsword, have a good day/night
[4:53:34] SlyGuyWillie: @Vashnaroth ah watching the korean match, i can see how mundo plays into rumble now, marin nearly just returned the favor, he just needed items
[4:53:36] DoinMyDance: Peace Oc
[4:53:40] Ocsword: ty u2 Vashnaroth
[4:54:07] Maxzzie: ArgieB8 HotPokket CoolStoryBob
[4:54:16] Vashnaroth: Yea @SlyGuyWillie also Rumble can't do anything to the Mundo in a splitpush situation

[5:02:06] drizzledd: thats worst than na challenger
[5:02:11] Vashnaroth: Wasn't he kicked from that team? I thought he was teamless right now
[5:02:25] drizzledd: isnt he better than pawn?
[5:02:49] DoinMyDance: He might have, he left um
[5:02:54] DoinMyDance: QG/Newbee

[5:04:04] drizzledd: can't
[5:04:44] DoinMyDance: Mickey might be my new favorite player though tbh
[5:04:57] SlyGuyWillie: thats been kinda problem with kt this year i think
[5:05:45] Vashnaroth: It's amazing how Mickey can be a godslayer and int his *** off in the same series
[5:06:36] rebeccamo: LUL
[5:07:03] drizzledd: Mickey was so fking bad at iem
[5:07:05] DoinMyDance: The problem with Mickey, imo is that he feels like he needs to carry, and tries to do too much
[5:07:13] drizzledd: he was inting all tournament
[5:07:27] rebeccamo: NA recall FailFish
[5:09:53] apolodakidd: my god spawn ScaredyCat ScaredyCat

[5:16:38] DoinMyDance: Do you think their issue could be Mata, trying to manage too much?
[5:17:07] drizzledd: idk their tf is so bad
[5:19:02] Archerzero0: hi
[5:19:23] Vashnaroth: THE TURN
[5:19:31] telenorbanditten: Wtf he live
[5:19:37] Vashnaroth: What a reaction from Duke
[5:19:38] halloderbaer: duke 4Head
[5:19:48] ESTEpo: BibleThump
[5:20:08] halloderbaer: varus passive gives him atk speed right? after killing something
[5:20:13] drizzledd: kt won wow
[5:20:26] Vashnaroth: yea
[5:20:31] DoinMyDance: @Drizzledd what makes their TF so bad though
[5:20:37] SlyGuyWillie: way for kt to make it look harder than it shoulda been lol
[5:20:50] Vashnaroth: "On kill or assist, Varus temprorarily gains Attack Speed. This bonus is larger if the enemy is a champion."
[5:20:58] SlyGuyWillie: @dasls
[5:21:04] SlyGuyWillie: yes
[5:21:10] Vashnaroth: 50% for 5 secs on champions, 25% for 3 secs for minions
[5:21:16] halloderbaer: thanks @SlyGuyWillie @Vashnaroth :)
[5:22:19] SlyGuyWillie: damn lol
[5:22:24] SlyGuyWillie: unlucky
[5:22:27] Ïû≠Ïû≠Ïû≠Ïû≠: haHAA
[5:22:34] Vashnaroth: NotLikeThis
[5:22:39] Vashnaroth: unluky
[5:23:29] halloderbaer: will we see a perfect game? ü§î
[5:23:43] SlyGuyWillie: in the lpl? probably not
[5:23:43] solcius: IM setup is full late game
[5:23:51] htl7: clown
[5:23:55] solcius: who made this draft? a monkey?
[5:24:01] Vashnaroth: Maokai Ori can still turn teamfights ultrahard
[5:24:33] Vashnaroth: What do you mean, outside of post-nerfs Maokai IM's a legit draft
[5:24:52] Vashnaroth: It's a teamfight comp with pick potential with Ashe Mao
[5:24:58] halloderbaer: its not like they picked lucian top Kappa
[5:25:05] halloderbaer: or pantheon mid Kappa
[5:25:09] xxobeerusxx: watching ants is more exciting than this
[5:25:16] DoinMyDance: Mao is good, hes just not busted
[5:25:20] Vashnaroth: Ants are badass yo
[5:25:42] solcius: if u think so, tell me wich lane is a winning lane?
[5:25:44] SlyGuyWillie: *** ants
[5:25:48] solcius: and jungle 0 pressure
[5:25:49] SlyGuyWillie: lol
[5:26:15] Vashnaroth: 0 jungle pressure due to Kid invading and getting the kill on Graves early on
[5:26:29] Vashnaroth: Which led to Elise gangbanging the bot lane Ashe
[5:26:33] xxobeerusxx: its like watching silver players in ranked..... better cs tho
[5:26:37] SlyGuyWillie: giggity
[5:26:40] FishRoeSoup: IM's comp is kinda item reliant on all members and all of them need good farm to be effective
[5:26:42] halloderbaer: sroCannon
[5:26:43] solcius: comon dude, it is Graves vs Elise, no sense comparing
[5:26:56] TiesAU: are you mental
[5:26:56] solcius: ofc will be invading or ganking and pressuring x999
[5:27:00] TiesAU: this is nothing like watching silver players
[5:27:17] TiesAU: there's nothing happening because they aren't fighting like brainless idiots, which is what silver players do
[5:27:21] solcius: I hope IM win anyway :D
[5:27:33] TiesAU: except for toplane just now, that was a little bit of a brainless fight >_<
[5:27:41] demiurggermanec247: LUL
[5:27:47] xxobeerusxx: PJSalt
[5:27:49] Vashnaroth: Odd that Varus went for PD instead of Runaan
[5:27:51] TiesAU: not the lul engage, the one before.
[5:27:55] solcius: LPL = no brain most of the time xD
[5:27:56] C00kleS: ULTIMATEly Kappa
[5:27:58] xxobeerusxx: lol i know
[5:28:01] TiesAU: *lulu
[5:28:35] FishRoeSoup: PD is unique in this situation, varus is going to only hit maokai
[5:28:37] rofflepie: they prob take baron off of the ashe pick if they got it, wasnt porintless at all
[5:28:41] halloderbaer: 300 farm at 26min FeelsAmazingMan
[5:28:54] trisssmerigold: @Solcius88 and NA loses to LPL every year
[5:29:06] KappaFrankerZXD: SHE EMPHASISED IT TriHard
[5:29:14] solcius: yeah NA sucks so hard NA games are random totally
[5:29:20] Vashnaroth: NA is historically bad at an international level
[5:29:40] FishRoeSoup: When was NA in worlds semi? :thinking:
[5:29:42] trisssmerigold: and EU go no further than LPL
[5:29:47] solcius: What do u think RNG vs iG ?
[5:30:01] halloderbaer: she goes for deathcap while having the mr item solo
[5:30:02] KappaFrankerZXD: rookie is such garbage this series lol

[5:33:33] trisssmerigold: and everyone shits their pants
[5:33:48] MulanIV: JinJao just disrespects IG's teamcomp, QSS would be really good but he opts into hexdrinker dunno why
[5:34:05] ShAd_1337: stalling out a game versus IMAY is a bad idea
[5:34:06] trisssmerigold: @KappaFrankerZXD can anyone from OCE even get intot the korean server challenger league?
[5:34:08] darkrainbow154: any region other then kr wining worlds might be cool gets kinda boring seeing kr team always dumpser others
[5:34:33] SlyGuyWillie: ^
[5:34:46] SlyGuyWillie: but it happens anyways
