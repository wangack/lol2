[5:32:14] TheDaydreaminOne: rly like an classic alchangover ... not that hard but kinda like ... hard to explain
[5:32:24] Dragonuts: only reason concetrates in heavy doses can give you a bit of a high next day is they coat your lungs in oil then body absorbs it
[5:32:31] Dragonuts: but smoking plant you wont get that.
[5:33:09] TheDaydreaminOne: maybe is from the heavy temperature ... is so fast so hot :(
[5:33:54] dan_e_: why the *** does this look so fast?

[5:42:29] Dagobert2424: why do they play with Eimy and not Intruder FailFish
[5:42:34] Wazirend: who cares lol
[5:42:46] Kaiseri: where is Punished?
[5:42:52] 0401050: Intruder is otp but still better than eimy EleGiggle

[5:48:08] kindue0: Lol I mean check the minions their blood is black
[5:48:19] TheDaydreaminOne: black blood = mostly a sign of HUGE liver problems
[5:48:37] halloderbaer: @BehindTheLeaves, minions are all alcoholics confirmed?
[5:48:59] kingkarus: TehePelo
[5:49:03] TheDaydreaminOne: what? did i miss somethin?
[5:49:09] OneHandyAndy: any1?

[5:52:52] TheDaydreaminOne: why isnt fizz played more?
[5:52:58] TheDaydreaminOne: in proscene i mean
[5:53:12] MTGOFerret: @BehindTheLeaves, usually banned
[5:53:13] Osteoid: Melted baron
[5:53:17] SlyGuyWillie: he actually gets banned more often than not
[5:53:21] SlyGuyWillie: nice
[5:53:21] OneHandyAndy: OMFG
[5:53:27] Aman12c: AHAHAHA√§
[5:53:34] Osteoid: ...
[5:53:36] OneHandyAndy: that was such a nice play PogChamp
[5:53:42] plasticspoonn: the smite package
[5:53:47] TheDaydreaminOne: i cant remember is i rly see that much fizzbanns in progames ... cant remember

[5:54:51] potatozrgud: Share the load
[5:55:03] Kaiseri: PogChamp
[5:55:09] CJDM310: tank fizz ResidentSleeper
[5:55:13] MTGOFerret: One that kinda surprises me that he fell outa of flavor so hard is Ziggs, did they just nerf him out of existence ?
[5:55:48] TheDaydreaminOne: hm
[5:56:00] TheDaydreaminOne: u mean midziggs or "adc"ziggs
[5:56:04] darkrainbow154: in my opinion fizz sucks if u dont play it vs a tank
[5:56:09] KayneAlexander: Did RNG win???
[5:56:26] MTGOFerret: @BehindTheLeaves, either honestly you just dont see him much these days
[5:56:27] ESTEpo: i want to see the play replay PunOko
[5:56:31] fnask10: rng lost 3-0
[5:56:34] Kaiseri: @MTGOFerret nope, but it is hard to play vs adcs with waveclear
[5:56:45] KayneAlexander: ty ty
[5:56:49] SlyGuyWillie: ziggs was more of a gimmick pick than anything, he takes towers but cant do too much else compared to other adcs
[5:56:50] TheDaydreaminOne: but he has gapclose,escape, good to huge dmg and so on
[5:56:57] KayneAlexander: WutFace
[5:56:57] TheDaydreaminOne: he can burst u hard
[5:57:22] Kaiseri: you only pick ziggs to take the first tower but if you cant push, you are worthless
[5:57:31] TheDaydreaminOne: ya in proscene he was picked cuz objectiveraping
[5:57:36] SlyGuyWillie: plus hes too skillshot reliant to do dmg
[5:57:50] Shouldof: ^
[5:58:03] halloderbaer: I found out about Fish streaming on twitch PogChamp more casters to stalk Kreygasm
[5:58:05] TheDaydreaminOne: but for midgame .... dunno why ... he didnt got nerfed hard and IMHO he is very good dmgwise and i like his skillset ...
[5:58:10] SlyGuyWillie: why pick him when u can just pick ashe or varus and auto someone to death
[5:58:21] KayneAlexander: SabaPing SabaPing SabaPing
[5:58:28] ESTEpo: and he's a mid pick so its illegal to play it bot Kappa
[5:58:28] Osteoid: GO ON OMG
[5:58:28] TheFurioso: FIZZ BALANCED
[5:58:31] nerobotas: OMG
[5:58:32] Aman12c: silvers
[5:58:33] rorschach1387: graves trolling
[5:58:34] zerofoxglven: ez
[5:58:35] SlyGuyWillie: tank fizz guys
[5:58:35] rebeccamo: fizz Kreygasm
[5:58:39] Dragonuts: knew fizz gonna shank them
[5:58:40] Uroxin: cmonBruh
[5:58:45] Dragonuts: he will be reason they win XD
[5:58:45] Aman12c: end
[5:58:46] darkrainbow154: lets run directly to kog with fizz ult on u gj
[5:58:47] nerobotas: one trick pony
[5:58:51] nutmilk___: MingLee
[5:58:52] ShAd_1337: OMG ,OMG SO GOOD PogChamp
[5:58:54] JackTT_TV: This TriHard Caster 4Head haHAA so bad haHAA
[5:59:06] SlyGuyWillie: i still play ziggs mid though, hes still fun
[5:59:15] TheFurioso: also syndra is really broken and oppressive
[5:59:32] JackTT_TV: Syndra is Balanced Kappa
[5:59:39] Snipawolfe: LOL. Fizz is like a budget nautilus. That ults pretty hilarious tho. Eimy *** Imp so hard
[5:59:39] TheDaydreaminOne: @Darkrainbow154, ya that was "questionable"
[5:59:51] TheFurioso: even orianna hasn't a change against syndra in lane
[5:59:53] JackTT_TV: In all honesty, it's so tough to change syndra without making her garbage
[5:59:56] TheDaydreaminOne: @SlyGuyWillie, me 2 .... i rly like him 2
[6:00:00] fnask10: I dont think LGD will do well at msi
[6:00:02] TheFurioso: *chance
[6:00:13] JackTT_TV: i'm, playing syndra vs orianna in my current solo q game
[6:00:16] CJDM310: ehh Syndra has a lot of built in weakness
[6:00:24] Snipawolfe: why flash when you could dash behind your ADC and knock him into your team? :^)
[6:00:27] ShAd_1337: s4 Xiyang Kreygasm
[6:00:32] TheFurioso: problem isn't counterplay
[6:00:34] JackTT_TV: syndra doesn't really have an escape
[6:00:37] Dragonuts: syndra farm is :D
[6:00:41] TheFurioso: she is very oppressive
[6:00:44] Dragonuts: he straight r pop someone now
[6:00:44] SlyGuyWillie: she still has no mobility whatsoever
[6:00:54] TheFurioso: all immobile mages haven't mobility
[6:00:59] johnnyboy1132: 12 cs a minute :O
[6:01:01] TheFurioso: that isn't excuse
[6:01:03] Snipawolfe: I think Syndra's pretty balanced. Just wish her R was turned into an execute or something so it did less damage to full hp targets
[6:01:06] JackTT_TV: the only way she should do MORE damage is if she lands the balls.
[6:01:09] TheDaydreaminOne: @TheFurioso, imho she is the strongest burstmid ... u only can try to counterpick with vlad or ekko
[6:01:19] JackTT_TV: Syndra can miss all skill shots and still 1 shot
[6:01:34] KayneAlexander: Let's OMGAzael and OMGScoots play this game. SwiftRsge
[6:01:35] TheFurioso: but she earns free orbs though wrong skillshots?
[6:01:40] KayneAlexander: SwiftRage
[6:01:44] JackTT_TV: yeah
[6:01:48] TheFurioso: problematic champ
[6:01:54] JackTT_TV: that's the broken thing about her i think
[6:02:00] CJDM310: she can if you're really weak and have no resistances, and she has a lot of balls on the field
[6:02:03] SlyGuyWillie: giving her a 20% true dmg buff when she was already strong didnt help...
[6:02:05] ShAd_1337: OMGAzael emote when Kappa
[6:02:09] JackTT_TV: i think the balls should contribute to the ult if she hits another champion
[6:02:17] JackTT_TV: only on the W tho
[6:02:24] JackTT_TV: and that isn't really the problem
[6:02:29] TheDaydreaminOne: @SlyGuyWillie, SO TRUE ... that was just sodumb
[6:02:31] JackTT_TV: you can't pick up 3 balls anymore
[6:02:43] Snipawolfe: someone suggested a cool change and I liked it a lot. Only let the orbs that damage champs contribute to ult. To compensate it could do a little more damage per orb
[6:02:44] SlyGuyWillie: that didnt help ***
[6:02:53] SlyGuyWillie: ^
[6:02:58] TheFurioso: I don't understand why is Riot still waiting for Syndra?
[6:03:26] SlyGuyWillie: @BehindTheLeaves i saw tht and was like ....'why?'
[6:03:44] TheFurioso: riot is favour to woman champions

[8:05:33] genioushero: ive won over 1200 euro on bet365 and never been banned. wtf are u doing wrong
[8:05:44] solcius: is not about money

[8:11:17] Chess_Poems: no common sense from these kids. I swear DoinB and a few other players in LPL are so freaking volatile. Mickey in LCK too
[8:12:02] Catova: how does bet365 justify the ban?
[8:12:10] Chess_Poems: WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace

[8:12:45] darkblade83: game 3 inb4
[8:12:52] fnask10: They dont have to justify a bann, they point to a rule saying that for whatever reason whenever they want they can restrict you
[8:13:01] EURANIX: i dont know why they go baron if they can just pressure lanes when they are winning
[8:13:08] fnask10: you get to keep any winnings but cant play anymore

[8:14:13] Thoraxx: imay DansGame
[8:14:41] kelflakk_: Did amazing j just cancel his ult with flash? What happened there? Lol
[8:16:11] Chess_Poems: On draftkings its more about pricing and constructing rosters
[8:16:57] Chess_Poems: So on small slates with tight pricing, it basically forces you to take one underdog and one favorite to make pure team stacks.
[8:17:17] KappaFrankerZXD: he did it TriHard
[8:17:24] Chess_Poems: Although stacking games works sometimes if there are lots kills
