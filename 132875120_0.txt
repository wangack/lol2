[6:48:27] Snipawolfe: Kalista has weird power scaling but she's great in teamfights and can put out a lot of damage in the 2v2.
[6:48:59] ughruhg: i would do her
[6:49:22] Snipawolfe: LOL. That sucks. They put their bot lane ahead and then let WE bot get first turret so they're even again
[6:49:45] ughruhg: yah theyll still lose theres
[6:49:50] ughruhg: so there not ahead
[6:50:02] ughruhg: or even*
[6:50:46] Snipawolfe: Eventually yeah, but first turret gold only exists once so that's a pretty big gain for WE, and until they take the turret back they're closer in gold than they would be otherwise

[7:51:50] Sokired: not a "spaghetti code"
[7:51:58] Snipawolfe: @Regrup I know. But him skipping sheen when it's soooo good in lane phase makes me think he might not go for trinity. Guess we'll see in a second
[7:52:00] amaurieuwest: what do u mena
[7:52:05] Snipawolfe: @n_0nsense and yeah LOL

[7:52:32] cabbage_g0d: 3 Ocean Drakes PogChamp
[7:52:35] WhoKnowsUA: @Snipawolfe maybe he wanted to catch Lucian and being able to answer all in or do it by himself aswell
[7:52:41] Sokired: its same as with blitz and ez
[7:52:43] cabbage_g0d: Tear

[7:54:02] cabbage_g0d: Literally just skrimming Kappa
[7:54:20] Snipawolfe: wtf. Lol. So he's doing regular build, just backwards so he has a 35 min spike instead of 25. WE Mystic best ez world Kappa
[7:54:23] michaelsund: Ezreal is a mid game champ FailFish you cant delay the powerspike at 50 min BrokeBack
[7:54:44] BettingDegen: Oh that's why he got tear 20 minutes into the game. Because he plans on farming for another 20 minutes FailFish
[7:54:55] StAthena: who gonna win
[7:55:02] BettingDegen: WE is going to win
[7:55:03] uzi_in_2017: TSM
[7:55:06] LeckoTUT: WE PLS
[7:55:07] cabbage_g0d: I mean i guess... if WE takes it easy the power spike could then be relevant???
[7:55:44] WhoKnowsUA: He could actually rush trifroce into that and make him regular season 3 Ez ADC AA based, very strong in midgame, probably even stronger than Lucian, but he decided to go regular build but building like that he just stupidly delays his own spike *facepalm*
[7:55:45] michaelsund: No Ezreal late game overrated MingLee

[8:03:01] weebonduty: what the hell? they have baron buff, they should go for a 5v4, why run?
[8:03:05] Snipawolfe: Or QG always lose around the baron
[8:03:19] weebonduty: chinese no balls
[8:03:25] BettingDegen: Because they have to focus Baron and after they killed it, they have no HP...
[8:03:31] BettingDegen: And terrible position
[8:03:41] cabbage_g0d: So why focus baron just turn 5v4?
[8:03:43] Snipawolfe: baron debuff is also huge

[8:04:14] BettingDegen: ^
[8:04:14] weebonduty: their hp is more than half after they take baron, that fight will be very good for them since it's 5v4 with baron buff
[8:04:19] michaelsund: Risking to get aced is surely better than securing baron for 2 plebs
[8:04:22] BettingDegen: They're bad CN team LOL
