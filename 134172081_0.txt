[3:33:37] FEBI_SIM_CARD_WAS_STOLEN: half the games hauntzer had to do nothing except farm lane on maokai then initiate teamfights since TSM ws always ahead
[3:33:39] NomadicHand: Seriously though LCK production > other regions
[3:33:47] twistedfatezzz: LCK so imbalanced skt throws game 1 just for 3 game series

[3:33:53] mrknizzles: I'm not saying he doesn't have a better team but he actually carried some games I'm just saying I don't think it's that crazy
[3:34:07] evil_amine: the music during introduction is so Hype PogChamp
[3:34:10] JustSanger: Though Hauntzer gets to be a better top laner because his other 4 teammates are better than SSumday's 4 teammates
[3:34:16] mrknizzles: What are the playoff implications here
[3:34:20] NomadicHand: TSM is just so inconsistent
[3:34:24] FEBI_SIM_CARD_WAS_STOLEN: @Eden_Fesi I am, ostensibly, if you think hauntzer is better than ssumday then you would say TSM is weaker if they had ssumday instead of hauntzer
[3:34:25] Sov25: @eden_fesi which is why the all nba team or mvp candidates aren't from the #1 team typically.
[3:34:33] Birdboss: Im so bad at casting, I got a neck tattoo to prove it. Female Yes, neck tattoo Check, terrible commentary CHECK.

[3:35:17] im_moyo: @Sov25 yeah lcs voting is dumb
[3:35:21] armaann: tsm with hauntzer is probably better than with ssumday considering he speaks english

[3:36:12] mrknizzles: Zig voted Goldenglue Youngbin and Adrian first team on his ballot
[3:36:13] im_moyo: @FEBI_SIM_CARD_WAS_STOLEN the all-league team isnt a question of who the better player is, its a question of who performed better during the split
[3:36:15] FantasticTT: why we are talking about Iraq when we're in China?

[3:42:45] mrk5ive: I got to the game late. Did rumble win early game?
[3:42:51] Brian410live: not all Koreans are native some are born here in the us and speak perfect English, they are American koreans
[3:43:07] im_moyo: @sciuccallucca im saying that an all north american korean lineup wouldnt perform any better

[3:45:06] Brian410live: each region has its on style, a Korean team wouldn't just auto stomp American teams..especially when given the time to adapt to counter Korean teams.. when out teams play against skt and their kind once a year, no wonder we don't do well
[3:45:16] armaann: the midlane difference isnt that bad, especially considering Lira will create pressure
[3:45:18] omiojones: ^ huh

[3:47:31] Brian410live: I wish tsm would do what clg did one year and play a full split in korea, like since spring split isn't as important as summer split go during that time just for the experience. it would be so cool
[3:47:33] 303Devilfish: TriHard
[3:47:33] Sov25: lira playing well when he arguably has three losing lanes and proving he was already s tier in lck is good enough to show how good he is.

[3:49:25] Sov25: svenz literally has got outclassed by inferior competition whereas crown is arguably the #2 mid laner in the world

[3:55:29] Sov25: @mrknizzles not sure if you watched hauntzer at international competiton because he doesn't

[3:55:40] UnholyDMC: insert any ADC? Lets get QTpie out of retirement LUL
[3:55:45] VG_Guest: @fnaskpojkenx that team would get smacked
[3:55:48] LordGam: i don't think any mid apart from skt can hang against Crown though

[3:56:10] fnask10: @VG_Guest I said all the worst imports for their postitions so ofc they would
[3:56:11] RustyTheCaster: Duke, Clid, Rookie, Mystic, Zero
[3:56:15] rubbruff231: @mrk5ive wait nevermind you wouldn't be a person if you were a slave
[3:56:18] mrknizzles: @sov25 I think he's better this year I know it's easy to get suckered but I watched and I feel he is playing great even on carries like Camillie
[3:56:19] RustyTheCaster: It would be better than RNG for sure
[3:56:24] UnholyDMC: What about forg1ven? he's nearly a god aat adc.

[3:57:30] VG_Guest: And then you have boosted trash cans
[3:57:31] Sov25: @mrknizzles a lot of times I've seen him do well from better synergy with his team. also helps that bjergsen absorbs so much pressure. international is a whole different game because guess what bjergsen won't dominate his opposition like he does in na
[3:57:36] UnholyDMC: pawn
[3:57:55] RustyTheCaster: Duke Rookie and Mystic are the easy 3 to pick up and would be gods on a team together

[3:59:07] trisssmerigold: I am just a fan of whoever is playing the best League of Legends in the world. And right now, that just happens to be imqtpie.
[3:59:10] UnholyDMC: Small cat, what are you meowing about?
[3:59:22] AI_Logic: How hard is it really to make predictions when less than 20% of the champs are viable in competitive 4Head

[4:23:14] KhaiChau: @Arnej35 Potentially... Depends on the luck of the draw on groups tbh. Like how H2k got to semis last year because they didn't have to face an NA team or Korean team up until Semis.
[4:23:34] im_moyo: @Sov25 yeah, literally all of the good high ranking mid laners are 1tricks
