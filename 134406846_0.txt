Rekkles is a good, serviceable ADC. The style fnatic plays is actually towards top and mid, leaving bot alone. So in the context of the team, Rekkles is not supposed to be the hyper carry

To put rekkles in comparison, Sneaky is someone who plays similarly and on a team that is structured to cater to top and mid first.

[8:38:01] WhoKnowsUA: @Terrorsq i disagree all teams u listed had some ways to avoid top opponents in some of their titles, Real Madrid in their last CL title for example. He had weak Roma and Wolfsburg as opponents. Alhough nobody is saying that they are lucky trash. They just avoided Barcelona, PSG, Bayern, Chelsea and Juventus
