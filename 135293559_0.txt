[6:14:49] definitely_Diana: hey @3XC3LS10R, why do you feel that they aren't that great? I find them funny and quite informative, :-)
[6:15:00] definitely_Diana: raz faces are the best
[6:15:12] iondefeso: rio lost them the game
[6:15:26] N1GEL: frosk is the only one that is informational
[6:15:29] Alrai17: i thknk this face TriHard is great for this stream
[6:15:33] N1GEL: pulse its EUs trasj
[6:15:36] CASTrini: Heh
[6:15:57] Dr9oC: Who won?
[6:16:18] iondefeso: lgd
[6:16:22] Dr9oC: rip
[6:16:26] N1GEL: and the last guy ruined the first set terribly with bad jokes and terrible casting, i had to watch the stream muted
[6:16:33] BooScaryGhostBG: TriHard
[6:17:02] Ultimateshinigami: @domroemer you're wasting your time talking with someone who has no construtive arguments so leave it i think they are all funny and good caster
[6:17:13] imcringingsohard: are there more matches?
[6:17:45] N1GEL: dont agree with you so my arguments are invalid lel
[6:17:48] CASTrini: RNG UZI
[6:19:36] definitely_Diana: sorry you feel that way @3XC3LS10R. What do you like in a caster? Perhaps we can look to align our style more toward your expectations in the future?
[6:19:46] Remortus: BibleThump I live on west coast I can't watch it all
[6:20:10] definitely_Diana: and thanks shinigami, but sometimes its interesting to see why people don't like casters, even if they don't know why they don't like them, :-D
[6:20:26] N1GEL: someone who actually talks about the game
[6:20:36] Ultimateshinigami: np man
[6:20:37] Lawanhermees: 🤔
[6:21:15] Midl4nekingdom: @domroemer, i didnt like you in NA but you've improved so much in the LPL it's impressive. Goon on you :p
[6:21:21] Midl4nekingdom: good*
[6:21:37] definitely_Diana: thanks @jinairkuzan! We've all been working super hard, and I know, I was pretty cringey in NA
[6:21:48] definitely_Diana: but at least we got relegades out of it, ;-D
[6:21:52] CASTrini: Cya later guys
[6:21:57] Midl4nekingdom: LUL
[6:22:13] N1GEL: think about the color casters in the western regions, pulse and raz together go off on tangents with mainstream media, the pepsi joke went on for 5 minutes one game, frosk usually keeps the conversation game oriented and not so much random side talk
[6:22:31] definitely_Diana: that def makes sense
[6:22:35] Ultimateshinigami: they've been talking about the game all the time , in the same time they've been doing jokes and so too cool off the serious mood ... that's what every caster does in every region to entretain people ....
[6:23:12] Griech: The only entertainment is hating casters Kappa
[6:23:19] N1GEL: that last set wasnt bad at all and i enjoyed the subtle or small jokes to keep the stream light hearted
[6:23:26] definitely_Diana: sometimes when the game is boring, or we've already set the stage for the upcoming fight at an objective, we'll go off on tangents to keep it entertaining instead of repeating the same things we already said
[6:23:41] definitely_Diana: Awesome dude, I'll pass on the feedback, ;-D
[6:23:45] Midl4nekingdom: frosk and rusty are the best but it may be from experience, dom is definitely the 3rd up there :)
[6:23:47] N1GEL: but the set before that was offtrack and very random, ruined the mood for some of the closer game
[6:24:07] definitely_Diana: Do you have a favorite caster elsewhere in the world that you like more? Maybe we can move our style towards that?
[6:25:11] N1GEL: well it depends on the situation, i like papasmithy and his style, i also enjoyed doa/riv kinda joking styles
[6:25:33] definitely_Diana: makes sense, I like those styles as well
[6:25:59] N1GEL: maybe instead of going off on tangents about random mainstream media and current world events, talk about the teams past or what is on the line
[6:26:05] Ultimateshinigami: @domroemer: don't take me wrong but i think being unique is the way to be a good caster so "copying" the style or some habits of a good foreign caster wount make the said caster better in my opinnion ....
[6:26:13] definitely_Diana: I'll talk to the team about looking into that in our next casts, :-D! I'll be casting tomorrow myself, and I like to get a bit wacky sometimes, so maybe you'd enjoy that as well, ;-D
[6:26:25] definitely_Diana: That
[6:26:34] N1GEL: i liked when they brought up stats and how people where in past seasons or if theyre new comers and rising stars
[6:26:59] definitely_Diana: That's Frosko's specialty, she loves going off on history and comparing this team to a different team from 2014 or something, and Rusty is super big on game specific details, like champion and item interactions
[6:27:06] N1GEL: i only watch LPL when im able to catch it so id would be nice to get the info to ffill in on players i might be unfamiliar witrh
[6:27:36] definitely_Diana: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. What makes it difficult for us as casters is making sure that viewers like you are current with the identity of new players without always repeating ourselves over and over
[6:28:17] definitely_Diana: e.g. if you were watching NA, and every single TSM game, the casters told the history of Bjergsen. It would get pretty stale fast for everyone involved, especially bjerg
[6:28:40] definitely_Diana: anyways, thanks for the feedback! I appreciate the conversation, :-D
[6:28:43] N1GEL: i understand what youre saying in that regard
[6:29:28] N1GEL: maybe talk some about the meta changes and how the players have been adapting etc, i like how they handled talking about imp and him playing on the kennen
[6:29:32] RustyTheCaster: gg!
[6:30:26] definitely_Diana: I'll pass that feedback along!
[6:30:50] definitely_Diana: Thanks for taking the time to explain your opinion, that really helps us level up our casting, :-D!
[6:31:20] urubu_rei: When will it start?
[6:31:31] Ultimateshinigami: thank you too for reply and good conversation towards something that is the core to make a stream enjoyable
