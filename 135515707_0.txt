[3:49:48] Tadiken: @THEARCHITECT7, just do yourself a favor and stop using winrates to judge champion strength. You don't understand the basic concepts of how stats work in conjunction with difficulty and skill ceiling in this game.
[3:49:51] Worldie: in a meta that's all about early-mid, committing to a 2 item spike as adc will *** you up too much
[3:49:53] Grondjuice0: WE 6th best team in the world lmaoo
[3:49:54] kynsareth: Vyre16, Because it's 3600 gold and by that point the tank has tier 2 boots and a completed sunfires and you have an item that takes 2-3 items to really do its thing. IE is bad until 2-3 crit items
