[0:13:29] Kalter_Aludem: do you guys think that SKT will make it to MSI?
[0:13:58] popeyes_manager_cx: KT looks extremely good right now, so I really don't know
[0:15:27] popeyes_manager_cx: it'd be great to see Deft and Mata obliterate Turtle and Biofrost in lane Kappa
[0:15:48] Kalter_Aludem: oh yeah
[0:16:00] ZZARU2: i just don't want fly to represent NA
[0:16:18] ZZARU2: at msi
[0:16:33] popeyes_manager_cx: C9 is our best shot right now
[0:16:43] ZZARU2: they looked really strong today

[0:22:27] mikehuoston: i'm hyped for skt vs kt
[0:22:30] soldado734: Viro modinha 3x0 em playoffs
[0:22:39] KinopioTFT: and a color blind one in chat Kappa
[0:22:51] mikehuoston: but kt looked really good bc they had a huge skill gap between cuvee&smeb / deft+mata&ruler/corejj
[0:23:03] ZZARU2: not the blue ones
[0:23:56] ZZARU2: they probably wouldve been able to stand a chance if they didn't pick lucian for ruler FailFish
[0:24:15] KinopioTFT: right, in an even match up in lane, maybe kt won't be able to 3:0.
[0:24:54] popeyes_manager_cx: hopefully Sneaky can have a bunch of 15 kill Lucian games at MSI like he had in that game against SSB
[0:25:01] mikehuoston: i think skt is going to win
[0:25:36] mikehuoston: 3-1
[0:25:52] ZZARU2: didn't they go 1-1 in both series?
[0:26:11] popeyes_manager_cx: SKT going to another international tournament ResidentSleeper
[0:26:54] KinopioTFT: i feel like skt, this split, only has a good team fight. Their map plays aren't as sharp as b4
[0:27:04] salsaguty: Is that the c9 coach Reapered? PogChamp
[0:27:23] mikehuoston: do u mind naming an example for me
[0:27:34] KinopioTFT: But kt is known and only for the team fights (and lane)
[0:28:13] ZZARU2: kt has been taking 20 minute barons pretty frequently
[0:28:13] mikehuoston: idk what else they could've picked for ruler. think the coaching staff didnt have faith in their picks
[0:28:21] mikehuoston: in his champ pool*
[0:28:36] mikehuoston: and adcs were banned out
[0:28:58] ZZARU2: yeah the fp cait RIP
[0:29:10] popeyes_manager_cx: Predictions for MSI: NA- C9, EU- G2-8, LCK- KT, LPL- RNG, LMS- Flash Wolves
[0:29:21] KinopioTFT: yea when it was skt vs bbq, bbq STOMPED them in every map plays
[0:29:30] mikehuoston: TSM, G2, SKT, RNG, FW for me
[0:29:38] KinopioTFT: the game where graves flahsed ashe arrow and stole baron
[0:29:49] mikehuoston: @Jw7641, thanks
[0:31:13] popeyes_manager_cx: at least we know which regions will be top 4 if G2-8 goes to MSI
[0:32:45] KinopioTFT: haha week 10 tho
[0:33:31] popeyes_manager_cx: still feels bad that Roccat didn't make the playoffs even after beating G2
[0:33:33] KinopioTFT: alright, time to order pizza
[0:34:31] popeyes_manager_cx: unless Misfits or UOL can pull off a miracle, G2-8 is looking likely
[0:35:07] bluecar0903: Which game will be the most competitive??
[0:36:02] NepZiN132: eoq china?
[0:36:15] bluecar0903: @graybloodd between these three games.

[0:38:06] bluecar0903: That's a pretty big discrepancy
[0:38:27] popeyes_manager_cx: it's the LPL boys
[0:38:40] popeyes_manager_cx: anyone can beat anyone in this region
[0:38:50] DraxtarLol: trash region lul lmao xdhehe
[0:40:01] popeyes_manager_cx: C9 Blue vs C9 White hype
[0:41:27] popeyes_manager_cx: low, but not impossible
[0:41:47] popeyes_manager_cx: I mean, no one expected them to beat CLG
[0:42:46] popeyes_manager_cx: TSM will lose game 1 because they're TSM
[0:45:45] popeyes_manager_cx: it would be nice to see FLY make it to the finals just so we get to a different org in an NALCS final
[0:50:16] YuriSwine: Why are QG playing the final game...im going to be up till like 8am now D:

[1:20:21] PapaSmithy: It was cool to see kt largely play well but it was sad to see Samsung play completely differently to their win streak
[1:20:22] Drakenking: They upped their jungle pressure, had a good early game, upped their ward coverage

[1:20:47] iamxcellent: I thought Cuvee was very bad
[1:20:49] popeyes_manager_cx: C9 has been looking rather strong ever since they started to consistently find early leads
[1:20:51] kairowe: @PapaSmithy, Do you think Peanut is the weakest link on SKT?
[1:20:53] mikehuoston: contractz outjged too

[1:21:09] PapaSmithy: I think kt attack Peanut and force him onto the backfoot yes
[1:21:12] VG_Guest: Haru*
[1:21:16] PapaSmithy: kt need Deft and Mata to 2v2 like they did vs Samsung

[1:21:46] Drakenking: @Nizar321321 2-3 hours, 3 hours for C9 series for comparison
[1:21:50] jmanyoky24: @Grondjuice0 if haru went to na, would he be bad too?
[1:21:51] PapaSmithy: bang and wolf are a better duo lane than deft and mata significantly based on this season

[1:24:51] 3323ssss: swift so bad
[1:24:55] PapaSmithy: it could be 3-0 SKT for sure
[1:24:58] jmanyoky24: @Grondjuice0 idk man i have a feeling we've been watching different games. sure, ssumday in 2016 wasn't what he was in 2015, and he had a bad playoffs and gauntlet. but that's just called slumping, does not mean he got worse. and as far as his performance in na goes, what makes you say it was bad?!?! do you see the people he had around him for starters
[1:25:01] PapaSmithy: but wouldnt it be *** hype if kt won game 1?
