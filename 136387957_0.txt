[0:32:57] roll1ng1: its sad these teams have 1-0 advantages
[0:35:09] CasterFroskurinn: The punishing factor of being 3rd vs 4th. It's to dissuade sandbagging in regular split to dodge certain teams in the gauntlet.
[0:35:37] CasterFroskurinn: Which is always why head2head mattered 3rd in determining seeding; trying to make every single game matter to the teams to keep them motivated over a long split

[1:13:59] ada_silveira: ??????
[1:14:05] goblinguy01: @eden_fesi Why should a team who played very badly, get more chances to beat you 3-0. You are rewarded for trying my slacking until week 7 to get into playoffs. Laziness and rewarded in LpL

[1:19:08] im_moyo: @goblibguy01 a lot of the coolest stories in sports history are about teams that stepped up in playoffs, this system discourages that
[1:19:09] goblinguy01: @eden_fesi The worse team will loss 0-3 regardless of the start. If IG can't win a 1-0 Lead, they don't deserve to win LpL.
[1:19:12] Jjmn12: @Eden_Fesi, no other region lets 7/8 place get in playoffs at all they're not supposed to be able to get first doing that poorly in regular season

[1:57:43] Beatsfor1: @alaso4ka cocaine is bad for you... but smells good though KevinTurtle

[1:58:47] Isadank: @BuddyLoxX does it matter if there's no precedent? This is mathematically a best of 4 with (and because of) an artificial advantage

[1:59:43] BuddyLoxX: Isadanknigh, the "weighted" implies that one team starts with an advantage, that's why it's called a WEIGHTED bo5

[1:59:49] DevoreSekk: @casterfroskurinn do lpl casters work for riot?
[1:59:50] CasterFroskurinn: @kshuna Galio has flexible itemization for early-mid resistances due to the free stats on his kit like the dmg reduction and shields. His initiation isn't as strong or reliable as Naut/Mao - but he has competing if not better lane control due to his passive + Q in lane for clearing and gaining wave priority.

[2:00:43] kshuna: @CasterFroskurinn, do you think he could see some play as a counter to the ap tanks like mao and naut, maybe combined with an assassin mid to make use of the ult? That's the best way I see it

[4:31:28] UNINSTALL_LEAGUE_PLS: NA doesnt have enough talent, contractz is sick tho

[4:35:50] Clairfoyance: @JakaGG, thats what World Champions do SeemsGood
[4:36:01] PapaSmithy: I think the kt that played against Samsung has a chance for sure
[4:36:20] PapaSmithy: All i ask for is a game 1 win for kt
[4:36:21] Jakaa: Agree. I guess it depend on their early game, cause i'm pretty sure nobody can take SKT in teamfights
[4:36:25] PapaSmithy: the hype would be amazing
[4:36:35] Jakaa: Imagine the reverse sweep Kreygasm
[4:36:42] prettydecentplayer: good thing early game is their strong suit
[4:36:44] chuen123: @papasmithy prediction
[4:36:48] Clairfoyance: @PapaSmithy, KT played well against SKT during split too
[4:36:49] cniamoon: But i can't be sure how good peanut will be too. He is kind of inconsistent
[4:36:50] Koti_88: Bang will 1v5 KT
[4:36:56] sladeazuma666: mata picks alistar, 1v9s teamfights gg
[4:36:57] prettydecentplayer: yeah i said 3-1 the other day as well for SKT
[4:36:57] Koti_88: Bang > Deft

[4:37:31] Snowkaai: k
[4:37:32] QuestCape: @PapaSmithy, other than Faker vs Pawn, is there any lanes which you think SKT is superior in skill?
[4:37:41] xkuffy: HeyGuys @papasmithy
[4:37:47] 303Devilfish: TriHard
[4:37:57] prettydecentplayer: @QuestCape, their bot lane this season > kT's
[4:37:58] jameshetfield1: Huni>>>Smeb EleGiggle
[4:38:10] Jakaa: Terrorsq Last year he got also crushed by Blank and this year by Haru. Peanut is a bit of a choker but when he's at 100% hes a monster
[4:38:13] DolphinPriest: peanut LUL blank Kreygasm
[4:38:17] PapaSmithy: in regular season bang/wolf monstered deft/mata but I think if deft/mata can play at the same level as they did against ssg that will be the big factor in kt winning
[4:38:17] BMRJosh: PogChamp i have friends Your friend Abyss_Blzdragon is also watching! VoHiYo
[4:38:20] Jakaa: Also I think that Deft is going to choke in the final.
[4:38:29] uqcm: @ best storylines of kt vs skt?
[4:38:31] cniamoon: @Terrorsq agree. agree. score must be the best jungle in the world
[4:38:32] prettydecentplayer: we won't see the kt vs ssg bc SKT's sidelaners are so much better than SSGs
[4:38:34] unclegucci: TriHard
[4:38:36] xkuffy: @papasmithy Favorite wrestler?
[4:38:37] Kal3l: only way for KT to win is for top and bottom to both smash
[4:38:39] Clairfoyance: @PapaSmithy, KT vs SKT looking like Worlds Finals Kreygasm
[4:38:41] EternaI_FIame: deft jinx PogChamp
[4:38:42] Koti_88: Kt will never beat SKT in a bo5
[4:38:48] sladeazuma666: SSGs bot lane didn't have the kahones to stand up to KT, will be different with Bang/Wolf
[4:38:49] Kal3l: jungle is going to be the big key
[4:38:58] Clairfoyance: @Koti_88, they did in 2016 summer tho LUL
[4:39:01] prettydecentplayer: kT need to win top side of the map
[4:39:12] Jakaa: @PapaSmithy, Yeah, but tbh in the Samsung series, Deft/Mata obliterated Ruler and CoreJJ, Bang and Wolf are 10 level ahead imo. Also, CuVee got demolished by Smeb
[4:39:14] Koti_88: @anonuuu current iteration*
[4:39:24] cortezzts: LUL
[4:39:25] sladeazuma666: if KT win topside, they let faker and bang run wild, imo they cannot win
[4:39:27] prettydecentplayer: god what basic teamfights
[4:39:33] Clairfoyance: @Koti_88, but SKT is beatable

[5:14:13] Crimson57o: My highest mastery champ is veigar CheepCheep
[5:14:15] Clairfoyance: @Koti_88, Taiwan is just FW and bunch of *** teams
[5:14:28] Koti_88: @anonuuu actually, it's just FW
[5:14:33] Yurille01: black blood DansGame
[5:14:36] prettydecentplayer: achilios isn't bad, but i just like atlus more

[5:15:07] MoonlightEV: Jhin is such a fun adc
[5:15:09] VincentErnie: LUL
[5:15:11] EdlesRoss: @jarvanl4 i am going to tell you how its going to be this year ok?`na and eu stuck in groups except for one team, which loses in quarterfinals, and final is going to be 2 korean teams anyways....so why do you even try to troll?
[5:15:11] Geistenly: @PapaSmithy Thanks, I'll play him
[5:15:12] itzshakehands: Make aatrox grait again :(

[5:15:19] volcanolad: that flash
[5:15:20] MoonlightEV: I bet Xayah is gonna be more fun though
[5:15:23] Clairfoyance: @Koti_88, beaten
[5:15:24] Shinji10TH: PapaSmithy, Any surprises from the draft of EU or NA playoffs ?
[5:15:25] Crimson57o: I've been enjoying Lucien lately. Trying to learn adc so I'm not so useless when I don't get support
[5:15:31] UnholyDMC: Jhin Zhou

[5:16:10] 헬스키친: TSM = MVP
[5:16:17] Clairfoyance: @Koti_88, ? LUL LCK has KR teams only
[5:16:34] itzshakehands: @PapaSmithy pls tell riot to make aatrox great again :(
[5:16:38] Crimson57o: @papasmithy what champion do you hate seeing on the enemy team the most
[5:16:41] Koti_88: Even so, Kt definitely isn't a "super team"
[5:16:43] PapaSmithy: Master Yi
[5:16:49] Crimson57o: Lmao

[5:16:59] PapaSmithy: Korean Yi replaced Korean Shaco at some point
[5:17:05] LeckoTUT: KT WIN BlessRNG BlessRNG BlessRNG
[5:17:10] EdlesRoss: @Koti_88 its the second best team in the world right now...WHAT ARE YOU TAKING ABOUT???
[5:17:12] perito_maldito: are any of them coming to MSI?
[5:17:15] Koti_88: Bang can basically 1v5 them
[5:17:19] Clairfoyance: ignote @Koti_88 LUL SKT or mad SSG fanboy i think LUL
[5:17:28] itzshakehands: @clearyourmind well aatrox wasnt the best champ but now he is completly garbage
[5:17:29] Koti_88: LUL
[5:17:40] Clairfoyance: yea mad SSG LUL
[5:17:45] prettydecentplayer: @Koti_88, who'd you say is the 2nd best team then??
[5:17:46] Koti_88: SSG suck
[5:17:55] mito_k: @Itzshakehands, he was never 'great', maybe he shone a couple times in a gold elo game
[5:18:08] Clairfoyance: @Koti_88, SSG suck, TSM or G2 best SeemsGood
[5:18:10] Koti_88: @trinkdare Definitely not Kt
[5:18:13] Benyeciz: guys could you please stop hyping the LMS for once?
[5:18:18] Atinyo: @papasmithy were you also disappointed with the ssg vs kt series? was hoping to see crown vs faker in the finals
[5:18:20] prettydecentplayer: so yuo haven't even thought about that FailFish
[5:18:22] Famousone07: lmao these swaps...

[5:18:35] solcius: we cant comapre skt to no one so
[5:18:36] Clairfoyance: @monsterkill111111, NB 3-1
[5:18:39] PapaSmithy: I would say I was puzzled at SSG playing a completely different style than the one they found success with
[5:18:45] Clairfoyance: @Terrorsq, BlessRNG
[5:18:46] PapaSmithy: but it was good to see kt address a lot of the criticisms
[5:18:56] PapaSmithy: both finals would have been hype, cant complain with a telecom war final
[5:19:03] fepl_: @PapaSmithy, KT gonna 3-0? PogChamp
[5:19:06] quzyyy: Best final imo
[5:19:07] mito_k: 3-0 SKT
[5:19:07] scorchinggames: ssg deserved getting stomped tho their comps were super bad xd
[5:19:12] PapaSmithy: LCK final is Saturday 5pm KST
[5:19:13] scorchinggames: they did everythingthey shouldnt have
[5:19:15] solcius: 3-2 skt hope
[5:19:23] Thresh_Will_Q_You: VAC
[5:19:25] Koti_88: Samsung is just bad
[5:19:25] EchelonBeam: NA EU LCS should give more advantages to top teams
[5:19:26] Geistenly: @PapaSmithy what does clg need to fix in order to come back stronger next split?
[5:19:28] 헬스키친: 2-3 KT WIN
[5:19:35] N1GEL: @PapaSmithy, ily
[5:19:35] Clairfoyance: @PapaSmithy, who would u say is best non-KR team?
[5:19:38] hansantizor: Picking Jayce was a horrendous idea
[5:19:40] mito_k: If SKT runs blank all 3 games, gg 3-0
[5:19:44] Crimson57o: I wanna see another faker 13 kills on zed in game 5 or game 3 whatever it is
[5:19:49] hansantizor: for SSG i mena
[5:19:50] EdlesRoss: @geistenly KICK HUHI
[5:19:53] N1GEL: obviously c9 is best non-korean team
[5:19:54] 헬스키친: 1-3 OR 2-3 KT WIN
[5:19:54] PapaSmithy: Flash Wolves is probably the best non korean team

[5:20:08] prettydecentplayer: Huhi is like CLG's best player overall for this season
[5:20:09] Atinyo: @papasmithy I hope SSG either goes back to old playstyle or polishes a new playstyle for next split, haru is so entertaining to watch and has tons of potential
[5:20:19] mito_k: C9 > FW
[5:20:19] Clairfoyance: @Koti_88, ? LUL they are
[5:20:20] prettydecentplayer: They need a new jungler
[5:20:20] Crimson57o: That game 3 in the 2nd kt SKT series was BlessRNG

[5:22:02] 헬스키친: RNG = JIN AIR
[5:22:03] unclegucci: First brick BrokeBack
[5:22:05] Benyeciz: FW does not convince me, they mop the floor with 0 competition and perform well at IEM. We all know how a dominating TSM at IEM got rekt at MSI 2015

[5:22:29] quzyyy: @Benyeciz Might surprise you at MSI ;)
[5:22:29] hansantizor: Darshan single handedly lost them against Flyquest
[5:22:30] prettydecentplayer: he does alright to others
[5:22:32] mito_k: CLG Seraph Keepo
[5:22:36] perito_maldito: ARE THEY GOING TO MSI?
[5:22:37] Koti_88: Lira cant be Korean. Contractz plays better
[5:22:38] PapaSmithy: I think its impossible to adequately rate FW @Benyeciz, they will perennially be over or underrated
[5:22:51] prettydecentplayer: @hansantizor, i mean cmon how many times is that going to happen? it was liek a onetime thing
[5:23:09] Koti_88: you dont get it
[5:23:22] Geistenly: @EdlesRoss but the games really ride on mid and top's performance rather than bot
[5:23:23] Crimson57o: CheepCheep

[5:23:37] hansantizor: @trinkdare You're right. It's just to show how inconsistent he is compared to other NA tops though
[5:23:46] Voltiate: As a Clg fan I believe that the best way to move forward is to blow up the team. Stixxay would be the only one locked in to stay
[5:23:46] Clairfoyance: Koti_88, BrokeBack
[5:23:48] N1GEL: @PapaSmithy, you see any potential in NA or EU?
[5:23:50] Yujulobster: EU Best team FW LUL
[5:24:01] prettydecentplayer: yup i was jus doing the same
[5:24:07] Benyeciz: Yeah guys, you are right about FW, I'm an LMS fan since S4 where AHQ upset EDG and constantly upsetting everyone since then. They haven't been able to get a real achievement since then tho, an MSI finals would be a great indicator.
[5:24:09] TheWaterBear39: doinb cam shaky
[5:24:15] Atinyo: @TyfloHawk, not aphroomoo aswell?
[5:24:17] Koti_88: LUL, Kt will lose 0-3
