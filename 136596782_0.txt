[1:47:46] weakestlink99: VG is in a good position though. DAN is relatively weak for 3rd in the LSPL.
[1:47:47] 不怕鞭炮的年: @trinkdare how about arrow
[1:47:56] michaelwa96_: LOD is arguably equal skill to WT at this point. WT looks bad on a stacked team... that says a lot

[1:50:16] VG_Guest: @kirazuto07 to be called a stacked team you need at least 3 "world class" players on team

[1:57:38] koti_911: Deft 1v5 sivir penta Kreygasm
[1:57:44] Somatic9: just a sivir comp lol
[1:57:48] Moszir: might be, I would be glad if they did well this time :)
[1:57:50] maball54: reach around Kreygasm
[1:57:51] michaelwa96_: also they've already announced their intentions to run a 6 man roster with WT (so basically a 5 man with WT watching every game from the sidelines)
[1:57:53] skippergong: 他们教练没话语权，明星选手权力太大。火狐走的时候就抱怨过。
[1:58:01] burnswin: this are bo3 or bo5?
[1:58:04] 大乌: S5有风哥 当时的VG教练遥控指挥
[1:58:06] Heisenptar: Imp ResidentSleeper rusty PogChamp
[1:58:08] skavwong: bo5
[1:58:12] burnswin: thx

[1:58:22] CyanideisJoffrey: Hey. Pyl recovered nicely from that face surgery
[1:58:25] 不怕鞭炮的年: 还不是把铁男放出来了哈哈哈哈
[1:58:30] DrHonker: they take DL, and WT goes to like fox or some lower mid tier team
[1:58:31] michaelwa96_: Yeah I'm looking forward to seeing them play with doublelift again
[1:58:34] Santrs: Kappa //
[1:58:42] CyanideisJoffrey: For a while his face was still REALLY swollen.
[1:58:42] Shidongan: Who will take that map?
[1:58:48] 大乌: 菜就是菜 跟放铁男没多大关系
[1:58:56] michaelwa96_: nah WT is going to remain with TSM as a sub for the rest of the year at minimum. That isn't speculation. That's fact.
[1:59:09] DrHonker: turtle is bad for a 1st/2nd palce team
[1:59:10] 大乌: LGD就是靠个人实力爆种 昙花一现罢了
[1:59:19] 不怕鞭炮的年: 说实话 时前几把
[1:59:22] DrHonker: but still an upgrade for midtier/ bot tier teams adc imo
[1:59:27] RustyTheCaster: @Heisenptar, PogChamp
[1:59:28] 大乌: S5的常规赛 他们都挺混的 都是季后赛爆种
[1:59:32] zer088: why are we talking so much about turtle?
[1:59:35] evil_amine: TTours
[1:59:36] DrHonker: def more consistent than keith imo

[1:59:42] maximusenceladus: who will win game 2?
[1:59:44] evil_amine: seizure LOL
[1:59:49] burnswin: because tsm is honestly on the same level as skt right now Kappa

[2:00:16] gerhartmm: what patch is this?
[2:00:23] applebunny2015: 偉神跟IMP 實力很強沒話說 可是整隊真的沒啥戰術 InuyoFace
[2:00:24] 水枪呆毛: 7.7
[2:00:25] prettydecentplayer: who matches ekko

[2:00:43] imvale: Galio
[2:00:44] draheriii: maybe I should be the coach for GT bc these comps are god damn booty

[2:01:56] lxe322: Why is Pulse even a caster (puke)
[2:02:06] koti_911: U DOCTA YET?
[2:02:07] michaelwa96_: pulse does a good job
[2:02:10] 大乌: 哈哈 看过a站funny的集锦吗
[2:02:12] Santrs: TSM is honestly on the same level as Origen right now PogChamp
[2:02:20] RustyTheCaster: Because Pulse is a good caster :)
[2:02:24] koti_911: ^
[2:02:28] nickodell5: if you think pulse is bad you should have heard the caster for the first set last night
[2:02:29] Santrs: ^
[2:02:29] Shidongan: PogChamp
[2:02:29] prettydecentplayer: LMFAO
[2:02:29] AngieFoxtrot: Pulse and Frosk have great chemistry
[2:02:37] Gohanssj2dbz: NA GANK LUL
[2:02:38] SnailSama: 为什么要黑我大法王
[2:02:39] 不怕鞭炮的年: lul god eimy
[2:02:45] Tsechaklam: 野王还是稳
[2:02:47] Zeptimius_: 2000 elo trap really?
[2:02:47] prettydecentplayer: outplayed
[2:02:49] michaelwa96_: if you think pulse is a bad caster you should hear phreak
[2:02:50] RustyTheCaster: @nickodell5, lol
[2:02:51] powerelectronics: memes haHAA
[2:02:56] ZZARU2: 2k elo is diamond LUL
[2:03:01] chuen123: 2k elo = d3 lul

[2:03:04] Zeptimius_: phreak is a great caster wtf
[2:03:06] skavwong: lol
[2:03:11] Seongpum: CoolStoryBob
[2:03:15] 만두보이: I literally dont know why people think pulse is a bad caster....
[2:03:17] gerhartmm: Pulse is good
[2:03:19] skavwong: 2k elo trap . seems good or seems bad ?
[2:03:21] koti_911: Pulse is very articulate
[2:03:22] 만두보이: His screaming isnt even loud wtf
[2:03:25] skippergong: lgd funny : my play style is similar to huni
[2:03:25] 抗吧凌风: pulse is ok compare to ls
[2:03:37] TiesAU: pulse is a great caster, people just hate on him because of the forg1ven interview :\
[2:03:39] decco41: if you think pulse is a bad caster you should hear Jatt
[2:03:40] Gohanssj2dbz: phreak good caster? is that a new joke? LUL
[2:03:40] nickodell5: @RUSTYTheCASTER not you rusty ;)
[2:03:42] koti_911: Screaming = hype
[2:03:42] Moszir: 2k elo is not even IM
[2:03:50] lumbas1: Worlds to relegation, basically Chinese Origen Kappa
[2:03:51] gerhartmm: Phreak is awesome honestly, his words are reaally fast and sometimes its like he's rapping
[2:03:57] prettydecentplayer: 2k elo is world6
[2:04:00] lumbas1: Pulse PogChamp
[2:04:05] 大乌: 法王和野王当时所在的UP可是要降级的，被LGD捞走，呵呵
[2:04:08] koti_911: Phreak is articulate because he's conservative
[2:04:09] ssimple2: i heard sivir forgot how to throw her weapon but it came back to her
[2:04:19] CyanideisJoffrey: eyy
[2:04:27] 抗吧凌风: cait na cs
[2:04:29] michaelwa96_: pulse did a great job in the forg1ven interview.
[2:04:36] skippergong: Up还有loong和world6啊，都不错的
[2:04:38] chuen123: so lpl casters live in china or NA ?
[2:04:46] CyanideisJoffrey: Aus
[2:04:46] lumbas1: @chuen123 Australia
[2:04:47] skippergong: 主要还是看战队培养
[2:04:52] prettydecentplayer: cait got dove when there was a huge wave
[2:04:52] 大乌: UP 只有一条大腿 就是loong
[2:04:53] 不怕鞭炮的年: 淘宝权对不起
[2:04:57] ssimple2: valdes
[2:05:02] RustyTheCaster: the casters live in SYD
[2:05:10] lumbas1: @rustythecaster HeyGuys
[2:05:14] nuttyrunner: goldv??
[2:05:22] CyanideisJoffrey: Rusty, have a Bundaberg for me.
[2:05:22] michaelwa96_: Phreak should be more conservative. He voices his opinions in extremes and it sounds like every other d5 player who thinks they have kkoma-level game understanding
[2:05:24] 大乌: 那时的UP没有world6的
[2:05:34] 大乌: 打野是野王
[2:05:50] koti_911: @shashounanren agreed
[2:05:50] medium_dog: UP不好的team
[2:05:51] applebunny2015: LGD當初買了 MARIN我還以為要主宰S6的LPL 結果還是一盤散沙打法 InuyoFace
[2:06:04] skippergong: I like all LPL casters lol, appreciate you guys for concerning this region, sincerely
[2:06:13] CyanideisJoffrey: NA hook
[2:06:19] ssimple2: Imp dumpstering west
[2:06:19] 不怕鞭炮的年: 因为没打野啊。。三核串不起来有毛用。。
[2:06:22] SnailSama: marin不就是个肉便器么
[2:06:25] 大乌: LGD能爆种靠的就是淘宝权
[2:06:26] hansantizor: I like them all except Raz...he's meh
[2:06:41] PatriusW: Savoki next lvl plays
[2:06:41] lumbas1: Sivir Karma vs nautilus is gonna shove in so easily so
[2:06:42] hansantizor: Gets very excited over nothing
[2:06:45] DePLANiTb: 好久不看比赛了。。想问今年LPL还有没有亮眼的战队哦OTZ
[2:06:45] CyanideisJoffrey: Raz is new, isn't he?
[2:06:46] medium_dog: sick ganks
[2:06:49] prettydecentplayer: even if there wasnt a ward he'd get seen
[2:06:56] gerhartmm: Yeah Raz is pretty bad imho
[2:06:59] AngieFoxtrot: @hansantizor, I love how hyped Raz gets, makes me smile after a long day
[2:07:07] ChaoS2751: 垃圾BP
[2:07:15] gerhartmm: Raz always says "And they say you know what? [...]"
[2:07:18] 삼도천심해어: raz is ex dig coach Keepo
[2:07:19] hansantizor: Yeah he's definitely very chill, which is good in its own right
[2:07:20] sadtakizawa: sivir karma bot BrokeBack
[2:07:23] 不怕鞭炮的年: marin都习惯faker统治中路上路打野反蹲了 去到lgd韦神当时那状态 当然炸
[2:07:28] pullup100: HI jjang gges
[2:07:34] RustyTheCaster: Raz is a brand new caster, he is getting better every week :)
[2:07:40] koti_911: TriHard is op
[2:07:44] skippergong: Tfw frosk was the only one on s6 analyst desk cheering for LPL teams
[2:07:46] prettydecentplayer: only if naut could land ahook LUL
[2:07:48] applebunny2015: 人家MARIN現在回韓國當了AF的大腿 當初在LGD根本被各種犧牲 InuyoFace
[2:07:52] RustyTheCaster: @skippergong, ahem
[2:07:56] CyanideisJoffrey: Yeah. Give the dude some slack. He'll get better.
[2:07:58] aitoresp: ?¿
[2:08:05] michaelwa96_: I love Raz. He's really entertaining imo. Looking forward to seeing him improve.
[2:08:08] chhopsky: raz has come a long way already tbh
[2:08:16] gerhartmm: Riv's voice is my favorite though
[2:08:19] chhopsky: he's really found his own style
[2:08:25] CyanideisJoffrey: d00d. Naut has been landing hooks all game. No minion is safe.
[2:08:28] gerhartmm: (Not LPL but yeah)
[2:08:28] meadowlands654: raz is too good to be true
[2:08:30] 不怕鞭炮的年: marin在lgd是真的惨
[2:08:34] 茅山道术: s6lgd不是上的法王么，伟神上了以后连胜了几局
[2:08:36] acriticalerror: 交流还是很重要的，沟通不好打得出啥玩意
[2:08:37] RustyTheCaster: I'll have you know I was absolutely on the analyst desk at s6 worlds going for LPL
[2:08:37] hansantizor: Riv has the best voice indeed
[2:08:38] chhopsky: i saw raz IRL once
[2:08:39] zephyrlolz: pulse NotLikeThis Kappa
[2:08:43] koti_911: Razlplasm's yeezy reference was so good haha
[2:08:45] AngieFoxtrot: @RUSTYTheCASTER, seeing Fish grow as a caster last was a highlight
[2:08:46] chhopsky: for 30 seconds
[2:08:48] prettydecentplayer: LOL
[2:08:52] chhopsky: @Angiefoxtrot !
[2:08:53] SnailSama: 不是很懂这些战队为什么这么执着于韩援
[2:09:00] 不怕鞭炮的年: 一开始韦神状态不好又手上才换的法王
[2:09:07] RustyTheCaster: @Angiefoxtrot, yeah :)
[2:09:08] AngieFoxtrot: @chhopsky, :D slinnedDino
[2:09:13] ssimple2: can't wait for Raz to hit us with the ol razzmatazz
[2:09:14] RustyTheCaster: Riv is god
[2:09:17] gerhartmm: @hansantizor Yeah either him or Zirene from NA at least
[2:09:18] RustyTheCaster: I absolutely love riv
[2:09:26] koti_911: Fish is dating a hot asian chick now, check his IG
[2:09:29] meadowlands654: love raz and pulse casting together. things get crazy.
[2:09:32] koti_911: no joke
[2:09:34] hansantizor: Riv is absolutely hilarious
[2:09:37] applebunny2015: 當初如果把重心放在MARIN
[2:09:42] hansantizor: Kobe is my fav caster though
[2:09:46] 大乌: 因为韩援好用啊，性价比高...
[2:09:47] gerhartmm: @hansantizor I think Kobe's laughter is so funny lol
[2:09:56] applebunny2015: 或者IMP兩個點位上也不會那麼慘
[2:09:57] 不怕鞭炮的年: 轮子妈能counter女警的吗原来
[2:09:58] SnailSama: 然而韩援一个比一个菜
[2:10:00] gerhartmm: Yeah he cracks a lot lol
[2:10:04] ssimple2: Kobe needs to pass the ball quit shooting fadeaways
[2:10:11] VS2135: LUL ULT
[2:10:12] hansantizor: @Jerrymenm YES that's exactly what's great about him
[2:10:20] hansantizor: I think Papa from LCK is good too
[2:10:22] AngieFoxtrot: Kobe and Riv together is just :D
[2:10:29] gerhartmm: Ah, Papa is sooo good
[2:10:32] 大乌: 国产选手不争气 能有什么办法？
[2:10:37] gerhartmm: He adds a lot of insight in between
[2:10:41] AngieFoxtrot: I'm loving the chemistry between Papa and Atlus
[2:10:49] CyanideisJoffrey: Budget DoA is getting better too
[2:10:55] 不怕鞭炮的年: 现在的国产打野跟上单是真的不行啊。。
[2:10:59] Jjmn12: LUL
[2:11:00] decco41: FailFish
[2:11:04] aitoresp: ¿??¿
[2:11:06] gerhartmm: Anyone else not missing Montecristo?
[2:11:06] NEXHypeLoL: GodGoon PogChamp
[2:11:08] ChaoS2751: 不给女警配个长手辅助真的菜
[2:11:09] ssimple2: the only thing about Papa i dont like is he can come across as overly critical but that's the only issue
[2:11:09] hansantizor: Yeah achilios isn't bad either
[2:11:12] acriticalerror: RNG和OMG可以啊
[2:11:13] nodricc: mbp
[2:11:13] AngieFoxtrot: hehe Pulse
[2:11:16] koti_911: ArgieB8
[2:11:19] SnailSama: 不是不争气，都没培养
[2:11:19] skippergong: Kreygasm
[2:11:25] Achilios: @hansantizor, >_>
[2:11:25] DePLANiTb: EDG和RNG今年打得怎么样呀，今年都忙着没看LPL
[2:11:25] meadowlands654: monte :'(
[2:11:36] SnailSama: 就只想着买那些自己觉得强的选手
[2:11:37] hansantizor: Oh *** i've been exposed
[2:11:40] applebunny2015: VG的上單 不錯喔 有站出來CARRY了幾把
[2:11:48] Krusher_: Kreygasm Riv
[2:11:52] SnailSama: RNG和OMG不也没韩援，照样打得好
[2:11:52] koti_911: Monte and DoA are making bank casting Overwatch now.
[2:11:56] AngieFoxtrot: @Jerrymenm, Haven't missed Monte at all, I miss DoA a little, but Achilios and now Atlus make it good
[2:11:56] 不怕鞭炮的年: 没到当年水平啊。。
[2:12:16] ssimple2: I miss three man booths in LCK
[2:12:19] acriticalerror: 给letme拿输出上单打得不错的
[2:12:21] gerhartmm: @Angiefoxtrot Yeah! Achillios was super good but I dont miss Monte at all either
[2:12:25] CyanideisJoffrey: I miss them, tbh. Doesn't quite feel the same. Also, Monte and DoA could keep me awake until 7AM. I love PapaSmithy but past like 2 or 3 just isn't happening
[2:12:35] lilGoobii: You know that LGD is in some really deep *** when Jinoo is their best toplaner LUL
[2:12:35] Jjmn12: @Achilios, PogChamp
[2:12:37] zer088: yeah, not so sure about that OW move, the competitive scene in that game is not looking the greatest
[2:12:41] prettydecentplayer: i think atlus has better synergy with smithy
[2:12:41] nickodell5: Papsmithy is fantastic
[2:12:44] gerhartmm: I mean DoA, not achillios @Angiefoxtrot
[2:12:47] PatriusW: Havent given Monte a second thought in ages LUL good riddance
[2:13:00] 不怕鞭炮的年: 中国的adc倒是很强啊
[2:13:03] Tsunnal: Best caster duo are monte and DoA, and Joe Miller and Deman who I think was the best
[2:13:03] hansantizor: I don't miss monte but he had amazing game knowledge
[2:13:04] DePLANiTb: 还是这里评论区好，感觉国内平台弹幕都不能看hah
[2:13:06] koti_911: Atlus is really good at hyping LCK
[2:13:08] prettydecentplayer: both pbp are fine to listen to tho
[2:13:26] hansantizor: @Tsunnal holy *** yeah deman was amazing
[2:13:32] RustyTheCaster: Atlus is rly good at hyping* not just lck!
[2:13:41] 茅山道术: 你可以去看背锅吧版聊
[2:13:43] 大乌: 急功急利，韩援占了那么多位置...新鲜血液自然出得慢且少
[2:13:45] 만두보이: @RUSTYTheCASTER miss your boy pastry?
[2:13:46] acriticalerror: 那就小狗和老贼猛吧
[2:13:48] ssimple2: Joe just call me joe miller miller
[2:13:50] RustyTheCaster: yes
[2:13:53] RustyTheCaster: I miss pastry
[2:13:59] Tsunnal: @hansantizor yeah I know, kids these days don't remember these gods
[2:14:00] 만두보이: <3
[2:14:02] sadtakizawa: Rusty is the best PogChamp
[2:14:09] 不怕鞭炮的年: lwx我看也不错啊 jkl还没上呢
[2:14:19] decco41: Keepo
[2:14:24] CyanideisJoffrey: Atlus is definitely much more passionate about the game than most people and he has the charisma to really push that out to other people. Pro hype guy.
[2:14:24] koti_911: Rusty needs to join lck PogChamp
[2:14:25] zer088: i miss spawn :(
[2:14:34] 大乌: 看老外嘲讽LPL也挺不是滋味的 只有我们可以骂 妈蛋
[2:14:36] Gohanssj2dbz: Rusty FeelsGoodMan
[2:14:38] Tsunnal: @rustythecaster BRING back miller and deman
[2:14:39] gerhartmm: How about Quickshot?
[2:14:48] acriticalerror: 有的根本不是老外
[2:15:01] hansantizor: Ahh don't really watch EU too much
[2:15:05] zer088: quickshot is the best pbp caster in the world imo
[2:15:07] VG_Guest: Deficio QS Krepo Kreygasm best trio cast world. Don't @
[2:15:14] DePLANiTb: 技不如人，甘拜下风，欸。
[2:15:15] skippergong: 别介意啊，老外自己赛区也嘲讽的，大家心态都挺好的
[2:15:15] acriticalerror: LWX还可以，可是AD这几个版本太惨了，被追着杀
[2:15:16] hansantizor: I think he's pretty good though
[2:15:23] CyanideisJoffrey: Quickshot has gotten MUCH better. I like his casting with Deficio, but he is still the only caster (yes, I have heard ls) that I have muted.
[2:15:25] eat_a__snickers: nobody watches eu except europeans LUL
[2:15:27] gerhartmm: @VG_Guest Actually Krepo has become really good lately
[2:15:35] zer088: pyra is really good pbp too
[2:15:39] chuen123: MONTE DOA PAPA BEST TRIO CASTER IN THE WORLD
[2:15:41] Sh4gggy: Eject Kappa
[2:15:42] ssimple2: Azael is the best they should let him solo cast
[2:15:43] SnailSama: LWX打的不错啊
[2:15:47] zer088: captainflowers has potencial too
[2:15:52] SnailSama: 金角有时候打得挺好
[2:15:54] Moszir: EU casters >> EU teams
[2:15:56] hansantizor: Eu is so boring. The top 4 and the bottom 4 teams are world's apart
[2:15:58] CyanideisJoffrey: CaptainFlowers is amazing.
[2:16:00] gerhartmm: Ahh whats the name of this EU caster?
[2:16:01] KominaKomi: "2 iches"
[2:16:03] 抗吧凌风: yea Azael deserve solo cast
[2:16:06] applebunny2015: 你看DEFT跟IMP玩AD 就會覺得其實也沒那麼慘 InuyoFace
[2:16:09] gerhartmm: He casted xPeke's backdoor
[2:16:24] 폭스마: HeyGuys Bye GT

[2:16:34] acriticalerror: IM中单雅典娜大腿粗的不行
[2:16:35] CyanideisJoffrey: Solo casting sucks though.
[2:16:40] NEXHypeLoL: LET IT GO AngelThump
[2:16:40] SnailSama: 金角中国的
[2:16:42] 大乌: 金角国产
[2:16:54] hansantizor: @VG_Guest I mean teams like origen and giants

[2:20:06] 不怕鞭炮的年: 老外们对乐观一无所知
[2:20:11] Talentueux: imp is still top 3 adc world
[2:20:13] michaelsund: Is this game 2 or LGD got a free win?
[2:20:23] koti_911: Deft knows he is still the best
[2:20:23] cantspeel: this is game 2
[2:20:25] Extreme_Person: League's Greatest Disappointment

[2:20:36] 大乌: 破解游戏的能力
[2:20:40] cantspeel: promo tourny isnt a weighted gauntlet like the playoffs
[2:20:43] CyanideisJoffrey: @talentueux Not only that, but Imp is like one of three people in the world that can wear those glasses without looking like a tool.
[2:20:46] im_moyo: what item is imp building?
[2:20:56] koti_911: Carry Potter
[2:20:56] gerhartmm: OH THATS RIGHT

[2:21:07] ImSudowoodo: wait LDG is playing promotions??? thought they were a good team
[2:21:13] sethcarry: deft is overrated
[2:21:14] alonsomafioso: Hope YM relegates LGD
[2:21:14] michaelsund: LUL
[2:21:18] NeilBeforeMee: DEMAN BOIZ
[2:21:24] ripdoni: who just said deft is overrated LUL
[2:21:25] hansantizor: EDG has full import slots...or something
[2:21:26] Talentueux: you put imp instead of wildturtle and let's see who can stop them
[2:21:27] NeilBeforeMee: @cookiesenbread nah they got rekt this season
[2:21:30] eat_a__snickers: Bork OhMyDog
[2:21:30] koti_911: @sethcarry deft knows imp is better

[2:21:51] ChaoS2751: shTbuild on cait
[2:21:52] koti_911: remember EDG lose to FNC? EleGiggle
[2:22:06] NeilBeforeMee: @jerrymenm he started casting csgo for a while then idk where he went
[2:22:07] 茅山道术: fnc 4:0 edg
[2:22:09] ripdoni: @Eden_Fesi, lmao LUL
[2:22:19] hansantizor: Piglet is much much worse than imp though
[2:22:21] ImSudowoodo: @NeilBeforeMee oh i see, i dont really follow LPL but all i knew was that they had IMP who was known to be a god
[2:22:21] koti_911: @Terrorsq imp make more than your mcm
[2:22:24] michaelsund: Remember the undefeated EDG lose to H2K and INTZ LUL
[2:22:34] NeilBeforeMee: Yeah they kinda let everyone down @cookiesenbread
[2:22:54] Talentueux: you put imp as TSM adc, TSM is instantly top 3 world
[2:22:55] NeilBeforeMee: Didn't lgd have marin at one point
[2:22:58] koti_911: @Terrorsq DL is chinese EleGiggle
[2:22:58] 不怕鞭炮的年: gimgoon还是猛啊
[2:23:04] koti_911: @Terrorsq Zven is trash EleGiggle
[2:23:09] Tsunnal: @neilbeforemee Deman went to ESL in general not cargo
[2:23:11] im_moyo: eimy has honestly been doing a decent job this game
[2:23:15] NeilBeforeMee: @talentueux not a bad idea tbh
[2:23:26] NeilBeforeMee: Oh yeah that's right @tsunnal
[2:23:35] michaelsund: Trash Zven achieved more in 6 months than Dlift in his all career LUL
[2:23:42] hansantizor: nah Regi said he won't get any non english speakers for TSM
[2:23:50] NeilBeforeMee: What games does ESL cover now? Csgo and what else @tsunnal
[2:24:00] Talentueux: you put aphromoo + imp as TSM's adc, TSM is top 3 and contender for world champ
[2:24:08] michaelsund: Aphromoo LUL
[2:24:09] momongah: BigBrother
[2:24:11] gerhartmm: @hansantizor That's why TSM is so successful honestly
[2:24:16] NeilBeforeMee: Biofrost isn't bad though @talentueux
[2:24:23] VG_Guest: @heirkaiba what?
[2:24:23] hansantizor: I'd take biofrost over aphro lol
[2:24:35] krazy2xtreme: tsm will never win worlds
[2:24:35] michaelsund: @EUscarra, MingLee /
[2:24:42] NeilBeforeMee: Aphro is a legend, but bio's actually quite good at what he does
[2:24:48] kiniewings: Biofrost is a fine support, i think he'll do better once DL is back on TSM
[2:24:49] Talentueux: @neilbeforemee worst stats in NA LCS and world 2016 and aphro is better
[2:24:56] hansantizor: No western team will ever win worlds lets be real
[2:25:00] michaelsund: @HeirKaiba, Did you realize OG replaced them with forgiven and Hybrid
[2:25:01] 不怕鞭炮的年: biofrost is better in TSM
[2:25:05] Tsunnal: @neilbeforemee it covers most famous games, HS, Heroes of the swam, ST2 and lol, but its held on an annual basis for these games. Not sure though
[2:25:06] NeilBeforeMee: Does he have the worst stats in NA? Didn't know that!
[2:25:11] gerhartmm: @hansantizor I cant really understand how Korean players can't speak english. Seriously anyone who spends so much time online HAS to learn english (saying this as a native spanish speaker)
[2:25:12] VG_Guest: @heirkaiba how did he relegate OG?
[2:25:16] watsupyouguys: TSM IMAQTPIE Kappa
[2:25:18] kiniewings: @Talentueux you do realize Biofrost in Worlds 2016 was still his first season in LCS?
[2:25:21] ssimple2: lol
[2:25:24] Jjmn12: Biofrost does not have the worst stats in NA lmao
[2:25:39] NeilBeforeMee: Yeah I assumed that he doesn't @jjmn12
[2:25:43] 大乌: 666
[2:25:43] VincentErnie: CN TP LUL
[2:25:45] toeycrunch: FrankerZ
[2:25:48] Seongpum: CoolStoryBob CoolStoryBob
[2:25:48] NeilBeforeMee: Who's the worst support in NA stats wise?
[2:25:57] 不怕鞭炮的年: 传统lgd打法。。。
[2:26:00] colearning: 87
[2:26:03] michaelsund: @HeirKaiba, OG deserves it FailFish they are such a joke org
[2:26:04] gerhartmm: @NeilBeforeMee Hakuho probably
[2:26:05] ispoketothedevil: Lep god
[2:26:11] applebunny2015: 巴龍這樣掉 好扯 對方打野還死了耶
[2:26:14] Jjmn12: probably Gate? maybe Matt
[2:26:15] Moszir: Kiwi still holds the death record in NA?
[2:26:15] Talentueux: @kiniewings so what ? zven first world got him to 2nd Best stats
[2:26:15] NeilBeforeMee: Kiwi had most deaths for like three years or some ***
[2:26:28] Jjmn12: actually it's Matt i'm pretty sure
[2:26:32] VG_Guest: A good org wouldn't replace a good team with bunch of clowns.
[2:26:33] gerhartmm: @Terrorsq What did they do to Forg1ven?
[2:26:36] NeilBeforeMee: Yeah Matt sounds right
[2:26:44] Jjmn12: he definitely was death leader for supps this season
[2:26:45] hansantizor: @Jerrymenm Yeah honestly you don't need to know that many words either since it's just for league
[2:26:50] CyanideisJoffrey: Ever? Probably Evaniskus
[2:26:56] NeilBeforeMee: Tfw terrorsq knows his ***
[2:26:57] 不怕鞭炮的年: s5韦神皎月单带吸引火力偷大龙。。
[2:27:12] ispoketothedevil: Red Canids >Skt
[2:27:21] NeilBeforeMee: The lower tier lpl teams look like *** right now
[2:27:30] michaelsund: Mithy is *** garbage Zven didnt play bad this year
[2:27:36] DanielSPoA: red canids at best can beat origen Kappa
[2:27:37] alonsomafioso: Lyon Gaming>Red Canids
[2:27:39] gerhartmm: @hansantizor But honestly these guys are geeks who've been playing online videogames all their lives (pretty much like me)...HOW?!
[2:27:40] Tsunnal: We all know SKT will win worlds
[2:27:43] lukasbildy: Terrorsq: lol he could not have only 2 kills in 6 games, maybe 20 is real, but not 2
[2:27:45] michaelsund: HeirKaiba: Emperor is pretty good....
[2:27:47] 大乌: 也就是分带嘛 他皎月带tp
[2:27:47] NeilBeforeMee: I think g2 will get creamed internationally
[2:27:52] michaelsund: LMFAOOO
[2:28:03] NeilBeforeMee: Last split even EU admitted that they were behind the curve
[2:28:05] akumouu: GOLDV
[2:28:05] Talentueux: Red canid would be 8th team in NA or EU LCS
[2:28:05] gerhartmm: @NeilBeforeMee Same
[2:28:06] michaelsund: This NA fanboy is so braindead actually
[2:28:08] koti_911: WEST
[2:28:12] ispoketothedevil: Red Yoda the best player in the world Kappa
[2:28:18] michaelsund: Emperor good LUL
[2:28:23] applingling: BabyRage TEAM? BabyRage
[2:28:28] DanielSPoA: @Talentueux now that OG is out, maybe 4Head
[2:28:33] NeilBeforeMee: It's not like NA will do much better, but they'll probably do better than NA if they don't get an aids group
[2:28:37] krazy2xtreme: i'm looking forward to MSI
[2:28:45] NeilBeforeMee: EU barely hit KR worlds last year tbh
[2:28:50] krazy2xtreme: i think only LMS/LPL can contend with KR
[2:28:53] chunidou: LOL G2 MSI last year
[2:28:55] ispoketothedevil: Brazil number one
[2:29:01] michaelsund: Emperor would be top adc in NA i guess LUL
[2:29:05] QuokkaOfTheChat: PogChamp ADC Kennen
[2:29:07] Talentueux: @danielspoa now Red canid would be 10th 100% with FNA and misfit academy
[2:29:11] NeilBeforeMee: Maybe c9/tsm/g2 fan contest lck
[2:29:14] krazy2xtreme: @Terrorsq wanna bet boy?
[2:29:19] hansantizor: Not even LMS, just Flash Wolves. The rest are garbage
[2:29:21] applebunny2015: 我挺好奇 LGD現在還有沒有在團練
[2:29:21] NeilBeforeMee: LPL looks weak
[2:29:22] lukasbildy: Terrorsq: So Zven has 0 kills in 4/6 matches ? Why he was starting adc in the game 6 then???
[2:29:23] koti_911: WTF? DansGame
[2:29:33] Zeken75: LUL
[2:29:33] krazy2xtreme: TSM lost 0-2 to a struggling RNG lol
[2:29:35] burnswin: tilted
[2:29:36] DanielSPoA: where's the zonyas lul
[2:29:44] Jjmn12: people forgetting CLG has consistently had most success against korean teams recently of all the western teams..
[2:29:45] QuokkaOfTheChat: God bless dude BlessRNG and welcome to the Big *** Club StrawBeary - @Imaqtpie 2k17
[2:29:46] krazy2xtreme: best NA team still got smashed by a chinese team that went 0-3 to EDG
[2:29:50] NeilBeforeMee: @krazy2xtreme fair point, but LPL looks a lot weaker thus split
[2:29:50] ChaoS2751: That's why lspl is prefect place
[2:29:51] momongah: "EU" LCS but finals in UK LUL
[2:29:54] 大乌: 他们最近在网吧集训 临时抱佛脚
[2:30:04] NeilBeforeMee: Yeah @heirkaiba
[2:30:07] CyanideisJoffrey: LMS. Flash Wolves need to end up on the top 8 bracket side with like MVP, KT to beat SKT in the semis and then KT to choke.
[2:30:09] michaelsund: @terrorsq really rewatch g2 games. Zven got *** because mithy
[2:30:12] 삼도천심해어: Kappa
[2:30:15] DanielSPoA: @Jjmn12 NA will have to play a wildcard tho.. CLG wouldn't survive that Kappa
[2:30:18] applebunny2015: 有隊伍肯跟他們練?
[2:30:20] Moszir: well, clg didnt get too many points this split, not sure they will go to worlds
[2:30:27] Talentueux: tbh G2 Will Just smash TSM or c9 at MSI
[2:30:29] 大乌: LSPL>NA
[2:30:30] Jjmn12: Wildcard > Korea 4Head @DanielSPoA
[2:30:35] VG_Guest: Why is NA talking about worlds? Oh nvm... Super team made top 4 EleGiggle
[2:30:39] NeilBeforeMee: Tsm looks weak though. IMO, c9 looks more consistent than tsm
[2:30:46] Jjmn12: Wildcard > CLG > Korea
[2:30:46] hansantizor: CLG will have to get 2nd in summer to go to worlds
[2:30:49] Talentueux: even bjergsen is not taking Spring Split seriously
[2:30:57] Molonym: LUL EU relegated to Wildcard last year
[2:30:59] krazy2xtreme: I swear NA fanboys are the worst
[2:31:05] krazy2xtreme: at least EU admitted they were ***
[2:31:07] Slurplies: LGD is in relegations? weren't they supposed to win world's s couple years ago?
[2:31:08] 不怕鞭炮的年: lol tsm is 1st in regular season, how's c9 more consistent
[2:31:26] michaelsund: Lgd tilted by Og
[2:31:27] koti_911: fat imp PogChamp
[2:31:28] MellyMelannie: EU were at worlds last year? EleGiggle
[2:31:33] krazy2xtreme: TSM fans were like if we had a bo3 against RNG we would win EleGiggle
[2:31:33] gerhartmm: @Moszir I was so disappointed that Immortals didnt make worlds last year. They wouldve done way better than CLG imo
[2:31:34] DanielSPoA: I was cheering for C9 but u know..
[2:31:38] Jjmn12: just because NA looks better than EU people who say that are fanboys? EleGiggle
[2:31:39] NeilBeforeMee: Just watching c9's series. Tsm makes me so anxious @joseph734155641
[2:31:40] DanielSPoA: they have been failing my expectations :(
[2:31:41] hansantizor: @Slurplies Yeah and then they realized throwing money at korean players isn't the solution
[2:31:42] Talentueux: TSM is so weak compared to others regions
[2:31:53] NeilBeforeMee: Like they have a way of oooking like they're behind even when they're ahead @joseph734155641
[2:31:56] gerhartmm: @HeirKaiba Pekrz always ints when hes a little behind
[2:31:58] TiesAU: @Slurplies that same year Liquid won NA summer regular season and they were in relegations this year. OG made it to semis and they just got relegated. happens to the best of us.
[2:32:05] AnthonyKaycee: kidding? clearlove is the NO.1
[2:32:14] NeilBeforeMee: Idk if you get what I mean, but c9 shows more commanding leads when they're ahead @joseph734155641
[2:32:14] Moszir: @Jerrymenm quite possible, unless Huni inted there too :D
[2:32:18] Slurplies: feels bad man
[2:32:23] DanielSPoA: DL could be the hero last worlds, but he went full zero instead DansGame
[2:32:24] 哦吼吼哈哈嗨: CLearLove leesin is the best
[2:32:25] alonsomafioso: The west is weaker this year for international events
[2:32:29] Tsunnal: CLG FANS never forget Albus Nox 4Head 4Head 4Head
[2:32:30] michaelsund: @HeirKaiba, yes
[2:32:37] NeilBeforeMee: KR > NA >= LPL >= EU > rest
[2:32:38] 不怕鞭炮的年: 4396走一波？
[2:32:40] krazy2xtreme: @jasonparanoia wtf are you smoking LPL's record against NA at Worlds is much better than NA"s performance at worlds
[2:32:41] gerhartmm: @Moszir LOL true! He also inted with FNC at worlds
[2:32:42] Talentueux: @neilbeforemee i think c9 and TSM are really weak right now compared to others regions
[2:32:43] im_moyo: @talentueux really? the only number one team clearly better than tsm outside of korea is fw
[2:32:43] NEXHypeLoL: :^)

[2:32:59] michaelsund: Imagine if H2K won that game at IEM LUL TW wouldn't be as hyped

[2:36:03] applebunny2015: 我猜IMP是想多打一點傷害 每場看IMP不管順逆風 傷害都很高
[2:36:04] Moszir: tsm just gets a debuff at worlds, its strange
[2:36:10] 不怕鞭炮的年: 毕竟两个赛区强度不一样
[2:36:13] gerhartmm: @krazy2xtreme The important ones are not yet decided
[2:36:23] iplaythefiddle: when will we see amumu in lpl?
[2:36:26] michaelsund: @moszir its called being overrated

[2:36:43] Talentueux: @terrorsq everyone think that g2 won't play well at MSI but with the results from IEM everything changed now, TSM is the weakest top 1 from all regions
[2:36:59] im_moyo: theyre all weak
[2:36:59] 大乌: 那年lpl官方最佳adc
[2:37:03] 不怕鞭炮的年: s5 的lpl其实蛮强的 世界赛打得不好啊

[2:37:59] MellyMelannie: bad habits die hard
[2:38:09] koti_911: Fat imp Kreygasm

[2:38:56] Kevinzhao97: 正方形打野 很舒服
[2:38:58] Talentueux: @terrorsq and this is not only like 2 years of bjergsen choking, this is 3,5 years straight
[2:38:59] 大乌: 那一年EDG拿了MSI冠军 LPL空前膨胀
[2:39:01] chunidou: 8.3k 4Head 4Head
[2:39:04] gerhartmm: @Talentueux They went against 6th place and 10th place KR
[2:39:08] NeilBeforeMee: Tsm is more like top8, g2 as well
[2:39:13] PastMasters: Na economy PogCamp
[2:39:17] applingling: 37.7k Kreygasm
[2:39:17] NEXHypeLoL: 3k LUL

[2:39:18] momongah: GRAPH Kreygasm
[2:39:19] MlSTERniceGuy: @NeilBeforeMee SSG is more likely than rng imo
[2:39:20] krazy2xtreme: @NeilBeforeMee sounds about right. hopefully no silly brackets like last year and hopefully no chokers from NA either
[2:39:20] hansantizor: 3K are you *** kidding me

[2:39:52] sladeazuma666: both junglers did absolutely no fighting, sad
[2:39:52] MellyMelannie: omg rengar wasn't afk this game????
[2:39:57] BlaKcRocK: 讲道理，拳头也是死妈。除了msi和总决赛，各个赛区根本没机会交手
[2:40:04] Tsunnal: @neilbeforemee top 5 teams: SKT, kt, sag, rng or EDG, few
[2:40:07] Talentueux: @jerrymenm and now the teams from korea who Went to IEM got to playoffs and took game off KT and skt, they were good teams at the time g2 faced them and g2 still won
[2:40:12] krazy2xtreme: @NeilBeforeMee CLG's lost was 100% their fault, if they couldn't even beat ANX they didn't deserve to be in quarters
[2:40:14] 不怕鞭炮的年: 有的啊 iem那些
[2:40:17] BlaKcRocK: 韩国就天天神仙打架，每个队伍都变得越来越强
[2:40:23] Meristematic: HotPokket and KonCha casting
[2:40:26] gerhartmm: @NeilBeforeMee I agree but that shouldnt be a problem. Top tier teams have to get out of group stage no matter what
[2:40:26] BlaKcRocK: 其他赛区就跟杂耍一样
[2:40:28] Kevinzhao97: 联赛太长了
[2:40:34] momongah: froskurin Kreygasm
[2:40:37] koti_911: Kreygasm
[2:40:41] Zeken75: I rub my nipple when I see Frosk Kappa
[2:40:47] Kevinzhao97: 欧美都打决赛了
[2:40:50] im_moyo: @tsunnal you think there are two lpl teams in the top 5?
[2:40:51] jumpman_two_three: This chick is annoying she sucks
[2:40:53] Kevinzhao97: lpl还在第一轮
[2:40:55] MlSTERniceGuy: @Talentueux Not rly. Rox and kongdoo didnt make playoffs
[2:40:56] NeilBeforeMee: I guess the ANX loss kinda screwed over CLG, but watching the games again just feels like a fluke
[2:40:57] gerhartmm: @Talentueux No, MVP was 9th and KDM was 10th at the time G2 beat them
[2:41:05] Tsunnal: @jerrymenm how do u consider a team high level, if he is stuck in groups?
[2:41:06] SNO0ZIE_: my 5 year old cousin can draw a better lion than her tatt
[2:41:06] roll1ng1: too stupid :D
[2:41:07] eat_a__snickers: LOL
[2:41:07] im_moyo: the top 5 teams are the top 4 korean teams and then fw

[2:41:23] im_moyo: and then everyone else is basically a cesspool below them
[2:41:24] gerhartmm: @Tsunnal Exactly. They need to get out and thats no excuse
[2:41:25] 不怕鞭炮的年: 韩国季后赛就4个队 lpl一堆
[2:41:28] chunidou: he said G2??? LOL
[2:41:32] MlSTERniceGuy: @Jerrymenm MVP wasnt at iem :)
[2:41:32] DePLANiTb: 要是像DOTA2那样经常搞搞世界赛也不错
[2:41:34] NeilBeforeMee: Yeah of course top tier teams should get out regardless, but the argument that EU is better cuz they went to semis makes no sense cuz easy groups
[2:41:35] Gummi_vitamin: pulse's seashell shaped hair is fascinating
[2:41:35] eat_a__snickers: tfw too stupid FeelsBadMan
[2:41:38] 大乌: 毕竟有12支战队
[2:41:38] Talentueux: @jerrymenm if bjergsen doesn't have doublelift he won't perform, do you see wildturtle carrying bjergsen because i don't
[2:41:44] BoosterSilver: Does Pulse have the same hair stylist as Frosk Kappa
[2:41:51] decco41: OpieOP
[2:41:53] NeilBeforeMee: Yeah turtle has seemed rather weak this split
[2:41:57] GrimZillaH: grill
[2:41:58] Gummi_vitamin: pulse's hair look like a dragon pokemon
[2:42:01] Tsunnal: @eden_fesi on of them, china scrims with Lms a looooot, so the level should be similar
[2:42:04] koti_911: PLZ imp 1v9 vayne SwiftRage SwiftRage
[2:42:05] AnthonyKaycee: OMP
[2:42:07] momongah: imp Kreygasm
[2:42:09] NeilBeforeMee: Tfw civilized discussion about worlds in twitch chat wtf is this magic
[2:42:11] gerhartmm: @Talentueux Werent we talking about G2 though?
[2:42:17] 大乌: SwiftRage
[2:42:17] AnthonyKaycee: too fat now
[2:42:18] BlaKcRocK: dota2 随时有世界各个赛区的队伍交手，大家可以互相学习。lol出了msi和总决赛都是在自家后院打架
[2:42:28] im_moyo: @tsunnal but it isnt... like you can watch them play games fw is significantly better than any lpl team
[2:42:28] MellyMelannie: @NeilBeforeMee this is late night twitch Kappa
[2:42:29] gerhartmm: @MisterNoiZZguy Wait, who was the other KR team then? I guess I got confused
[2:42:31] 不怕鞭炮的年: 这波野王那么久没死很关键
[2:42:35] BoosterSilver: dota 2 DansGame
[2:42:40] MlSTERniceGuy: @Jerrymenm Rox and kongdoo
[2:42:42] Kevinzhao97: 今年msi也是韩国的
[2:42:51] Talentueux: @jerrymenm yeah and g2 Will beat TSM 100% because doublelift is not here
[2:42:55] Quivain: hi
[2:43:01] gerhartmm: @MisterNoiZZguy Ah, true! 9th and 10th at the time they faced G2 still
[2:43:04] momongah: pulse Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:43:08] SNO0ZIE_: this girl more manly than 90% of chat LUL
[2:43:09] 不怕鞭炮的年: 看lck总决赛就知道哪个msi冠军
[2:43:10] luepert: what do these people have against hair on the sides of their heads?
[2:43:13] Tsunnal: @eden_fesi I think LPL will either get a MSI buff or will be. Joke
[2:43:17] MlSTERniceGuy: @Jerrymenm correct
[2:43:20] NeilBeforeMee: I don't think 100%, but higher chance of losing without DL @talentueux
[2:43:30] Talentueux: @jerrymenm no doublelift means biofrost inting 90% of the game and bjergsen not performing at his best
[2:43:31] eat_a__snickers: @t_e_a_, LUL
[2:43:35] demyoo: Pulse WutFace WutFace
[2:43:45] gerhartmm: @Talentueux But why do you think I care about TSM lol. Like why are you trying to make an argument about that?
[2:43:47] AnthonyKaycee: 这么晚了 老美都不睡觉的么 还在这里发弹幕
[2:43:53] SNO0ZIE_: @eat_a__snickers, EleGiggle
[2:43:58] Kevinzhao97: lck今年太强了
[2:44:06] momongah: pyl BibleThump BibleThump
[2:44:06] BoosterSilver: Don't make fun of Pulse BibleThump his parents left him there for Frosk to babysit Kappa
[2:44:08] gerhartmm: @Talentueux I dont think they could though, but thats not the point anyway lol
[2:44:09] NeilBeforeMee: DL kinda made up for turtle's inability to lane on immobile champs
[2:44:10] im_moyo: Arguing whether G2 can beat TSM is arguing whether a blind man can beat a man without arms.
[2:44:21] NeilBeforeMee: Pretty much @eden_fesi
[2:44:21] Talentueux: @jerrymenm because TSM Will go to msi as NA LCS
[2:44:24] wholemoss: 金工下个赛季不知道还会不会打lpl
[2:44:24] 大乌: 肯定有很多亚洲其他地区的观众 不一定欧美
[2:44:33] Quivain: DOES ANYONE HAS A TWITCH PRIME CODE Who like to share for a game i play plz me , thx alot
[2:44:34] 不怕鞭炮的年: skt跟kt五核战队 很恐怖
[2:44:34] NeilBeforeMee: Most accurate thing I've heard today @eden_fesi
[2:44:42] koti_911: fat imp best imp
[2:44:45] CyanideisJoffrey: "I can see, therefore, I can kick you in the dick."
[2:44:46] SNO0ZIE_: buncha 100 pound blone head idiot punk kids in chat LUL
[2:44:47] NeilBeforeMee: @quivain you can get banned for that
[2:44:50] Meristematic: so, the two winners of the qualifying round are in LPL, where does the 4th team come from?
[2:44:56] Talentueux: @jerrymenm we gave bjergsen the chance to perform for 3 years now, and every time he managed to choke
[2:44:57] Meristematic: Do the 2 losers play each other?
[2:45:08] CyanideisJoffrey: Yeah
[2:45:19] NeilBeforeMee: @talentueux I don't think it's all on bjerg tho
[2:45:21] Chaotic_Old_Bore: @Meristematic, im guessing that is correct
[2:45:38] MlSTERniceGuy: @Meristematic Nop they are out
[2:45:49] Meristematic: So you're guarrenteed 2 challenger teams in LPL next split
[2:45:50] gerhartmm: @Talentueux Ah, I see, yeah. Well it's gonna be tough though. I do think TSM will go to MSI but its hard to tell with C9
[2:45:53] Talentueux: @neilbeforemee yeah but i think he can't shotcall without doublelift
[2:45:54] NeilBeforeMee: Like bjerg choke and turtle's inability to carry is more the problem rather than just bjerg
[2:45:56] Tsunnal: @meristematic the 2 losers in the qualifying rounds
[2:45:58] BlaKcRocK: Twitch chat arguing wether NA or EU is better when in fact they're both bad LUL
[2:46:03] MlSTERniceGuy: @Meristematic I tihkn the 2 losers of the qualifying round will play for the last spot
[2:46:03] koti_911: imp bout to pull out the Vayne
[2:46:11] gerhartmm: @Talentueux Also I think Hauntzer is performing super good so now Bjergsen doesnt have to hard carry
[2:46:11] NeilBeforeMee: We're not arguing about that tho @blakcrock
[2:46:22] MlSTERniceGuy: @Meristematic No, the only the first
[2:46:31] GrimZillaH: is this bo5?
[2:46:36] NeilBeforeMee: That's true, hauntzer has taken a leading role on tsm nowadays
[2:46:37] Talentueux: @neilbeforemee wildturtle will tilt TSM hard if he flashes in
[2:46:37] MlSTERniceGuy: @Meristematic *only the
[2:46:44] NeilBeforeMee: Yes @grimzillah
[2:46:49] GrimZillaH: thanks
[2:46:53] 大乌: 人家韩国lol论坛很多技术贴，游戏攻略...我们国内的论坛，呵呵
[2:46:56] gerhartmm: @Talentueux Oh god please dont let him flash in
[2:47:03] NeilBeforeMee: Turtle really needs to work on his focus and positioning
[2:47:09] BizarreKoopa: GO LGD!!!

[2:47:43] toeycrunch: 3-0 or 3-2 Kappa
[2:47:44] NeilBeforeMee: Yeah ofc they will @tsunnal
[2:47:45] koti_911: imp wearing 2000 dollar pants
