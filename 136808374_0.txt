[3:03:01] thlghdeology: But seriously, players bring their own peripherals. If it is the mouse actually failing, tough shit. If it is determined to be a software issue or the usb port on the tower provided then that would warrant a remake. Probably what they are trying to figure out.
[3:03:05] adrianstent: RUSTY TROLLING

They could move on the next game and come back to this one, probably, but as for this specific game is concerned, if both coach stand their ground, it may take a while
