[1:09:06] sololanefiora: for trade
[1:09:23] sololanefiora: i dont think that uzi ISNT their main growing focus
[1:09:23] westbrook: why do you guys want uzi, he got spoon fed both games and still struggled in the 1st and lost the 2nd.
[1:09:35] sololanefiora: long term at least
[1:09:43] jamespac123: shadow KEKW

[1:10:48] 水原千鶴的老公: BLG 2-0 EZ
[1:10:58] TwistedGiraff3: Uzi was best adc in the world and seemingly retired early. His return is like the resurrection of jesus
[1:11:28] westbrook: can't blame doggo for his recent performance. 95% of people chanting for uzi gotta take a mental toll on him
[1:11:32] emerili: BLG will go 0-1, just to have an excuse to get Uzi on stage Chatting

[1:14:46] worlds2024: @sauvkb what?
[1:14:49] kanexx10: dont undestadn why they arent plaing him

[1:18:15] tranngocvan00: @majinglane bin overrated
[1:18:20] bluesclues96: once there's playoffs uzi plays 100% of the games, he usually doesnt play in the season

[1:19:04] theraiderrr: @MilkPlease does he even practice? I don't get how get can't be well enough to play every series, but well enough to do the practice which does with it

[1:20:52] MilkPlease: @theraiderrr im pretty sure Uzi has been practising alot in solo queue and in scrims so they wouldnt want to risk him breaking down on stage early due to health issues
[1:20:53] sololanefiora: @theraiderrr hes not in games because hes better or worse. its really really really them putting people on main roster for like experience and it adds more value for trading.
