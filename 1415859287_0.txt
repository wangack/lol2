[0:49:14] irlgigachad: are you sure starts? just graphic i think? ON has shown the team performs/wins with him through most of the season
[0:49:59] irlgigachad: Roster swap post RNG would be super reflexive, but i suppose LGD is a good team to play with

[0:58:37] avifaraday: SA replace ON is best joke i heard today LUL
[0:59:10] Orion_627: SA bench
[0:59:35] Malundu: The bigger question that the support starter is if TheSHy will int this series or not. He's always unpredictable

[1:06:23] TheMarshMatrix: @pablonico79 Yeah no problem. Suning was pretty good in 2020, so it's neat seeing them all back together except for Bin
[1:06:30] rotulive: weibo 2:0,edg 2,5+
[1:06:32] kaoru_12: mods really???
[1:06:40] irlgigachad: @nguyenhung410 idk there was a massive scandal where people got exposed and handed suspended, none of those players were included. Mainly theshy/sofm, just limit playing players
[1:06:47] Malundu: TheShy is a madman. He either smurfs on folks or he trolls.
[1:07:06] Orion_627: gamba pls
[1:07:08] TheMarshMatrix: @oooooomanooo Yeah theshy is a glass cannon type player for sure lol. Either he smurfs or he throws

[1:08:42] irlgigachad: @nguyenhung410 Yeah I saw, but I just think they're an arrogant team who miscalculated and if you were charitable and rewatched you could see if things slightly changed it does change the course of things
[1:08:48] TheMarshMatrix: Granted Weibo should win the series for sure either way
[1:08:49] TwickenTrickster2: what time do the games start?
[1:08:52] Alpha9920: who need to win this series message me on twitch
[1:09:00] Ant_Slays: Moleeee
[1:09:08] TheMarshMatrix: @roidrage999 Agreed
[1:09:08] irlgigachad: That second game started at draft though where that comp was too squishy and sion was open
[1:09:17] Malundu: if WGB fails, it will be because of TheShy or mid.
[1:09:20] codein_enjoyer: it's just they always throw some matches for the money
[1:09:26] gar000001: Imagine watch LPL match KEKW
