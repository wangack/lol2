[1:52:56] CrsBillyMays: @peanutbutter221 tbh i have no team loyalty, t1 is just my cup of tea. Their playstyle is what i like (macro macro macro), so many games they start out behind in kills and just like never falter. I wouldn't be said if they got rolled, but for now they give me the juice i want to see lol
[1:53:00] jetlagging1: @captainkrajick Nah.
