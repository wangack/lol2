[1:31:19] beck_temp: @bigchiefin13 she is very good in soloQ. You have kill pressure early, item spike earlier cause no boot passive, late game teamfight with W and R, can hard carry a game if you are fed enough, consistent damage  in team fight. Only weak point is you can't roam early (cause no boot )
