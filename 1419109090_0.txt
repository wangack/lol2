[1:29:53] 위드오닌: Fuck reksai
[1:30:00] kayonas: @monobeno thank you for not being one of them.  i mean uzi is a great player but they honestly think he could carry them to challenger or something lol
[1:30:08] gummyybearr: ez 2-1
[1:30:09] sephiroxical19981202: @kayonas UZI being 100% of the reason they win is obviously an exaggeration, but it's safe to say he's 60% of the reason in many series, which is amazing for an individual in a 5V5 game
[1:30:09] Rater9: Viktor so good into them
[1:30:12] b_webz_: ruck feksai
[1:30:14] 泫雅老公: 369 needs to pick gragas now free win
[1:30:14] monobeno: Only Leyan can play Reksai, Tarzan is too bad to win with it
[1:30:15] discord_421: @kayonas Kayonas, go watch RNG's games, watch Letme and Xiaohu run it down before Uzi just straight up wins a team fight.  You just don't understand what you're talking abut.

[1:33:33] WillItbe: depends how ahead tryn can get and if knows how to split push. otherwise it's JDG better team
[1:33:34] discord_421: @monobeno As I said, RNG locked Uzi into a contract in his first season, which mean he could not leave RNG, and RNG had a god awful track record on picking up anyone competent. They literally had Cryin as their mid, and shifted Xiaohu top becuase they can't find players.
[1:33:34] bitcatbite: monkaMEGA

[2:07:57] ye1l: @bailst222 Also had the 1st or 2nd biggest choke in worlds history. Let's not forget that.
[2:07:58] kayonas: @discord_421 for instance lebron james is without a doubt the best athlete the nba has ever seen, and has  massive physical advantage over other players.  its no wonder why he goes to the nba finals ond ifferent teams over and over
[2:08:02] dminuskia: I hope JDG win spring and TES win summer this year

[2:08:28] ye1l: Only Dade and maybe godV can contend Doinb for being the biggest choker in league history
[2:08:29] monobeno: @TheePaint1 I want LvMao to play because I don't want LNG at worlds
[2:08:38] angrybirds_007: china best mis night
[2:08:39] monobeno: @TheePaint1 Not with this shitter jungle and mid
[2:08:40] 泫雅老公: @A_Wan_Cake I think unless JDG played really bad at early game. No way LNG can win with this Draft. Tryn/Akali/Reksai can only do damage on Aphe but too much cc for JDG to protect Aphe/Victor. And Jinx cannot do shit if no one help her to kill someone for passive

[2:08:51] discord_421: @kayonas In NBA, you cannot make a tangible lead for yourself in a game. You are always going to be the same level of player at the start of the game, as you are at the end of the game, if anything you get worse. In league, with the how items, and levels work, you become stronger as you play. If you are skilled enough, the absolute gap between you and anyone else stats is massive.

[2:09:44] kayonas: @discord_421 ya bud in league its a lot harder to win games by yourself when everybody starts with the same gold/exp. in order for your theory to be correct, it would mean that uzi is light years more intelligent than al the other players
[2:09:45] sephiroxical19981202: @kayonas I would say esports are still somewhat physical, some people can just nail insane fighting games combos after a few tries why other people like me struggle to get even the most basic ones

[3:03:22] TheOreoCupcake: Nuguri refused to speak with his team at all. DoinB had to do the heavy lifting alongside Crisp. Last year, definitely the best player in the LPL before going to worlds. Worlds was a bad run, but for FPX as a whole.
[3:03:23] featherstorm_: @darkapplez people came in to the split saying LNG is the best mid jungle duo in the world or are people gonna disregard that again. just like how they never acknowledged the fact that they put him in the top 3 players, not midlaners, last year. just saying people tend to overhype him. i dont know the reason. maybe because he is likeable
[3:03:49] bailst222: tarzan #4 dpm jg--lvmao #8 assists supp
[3:04:08] TheOreoCupcake: @featherstorm_ You forgot the fact they signed LvMao mid way and replaced Iwandy. Iwandy is good but not LvMao.
[3:04:34] Moobot: THE LPL NOW HAS AN OFFICIAL DISCORD SERVER! Join here: https://discord.com/invite/tZBguQtcAc
[3:04:36] bluesclues96: JDG will definitely make playoffs
[3:04:40] 不行啦不行啦: V5 monkaS
[3:04:58] Darkapplez: @featherstorm_ It's simple, Doinb has shown he has the potential to be one of the best mids in the world. Tarzan has the potential to be one of the best junglers in the world. The fact that it hasn't worked out doesn't change that.
[3:05:02] TheOreoCupcake: @bluesclues96 They're the same score as LNG now so they most probably will Pog
[3:05:06] 후니조아: hi
[3:05:08] Warzard908: @AKBouse yea it was last year or 2020
[3:05:08] discord_421: @featherstorm_ And people came into the split thinking that V5 and WBG were going to be middle of the pack teams. People thought that BLG was going to be a top 3 team. How people perform verse the expectation doesn't mean that the expectation was wrong to have.
