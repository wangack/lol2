[1:04:38] scottoflorida2014: Doggo has had some amazing games
[1:05:00] Malundu: Doggo is good though

[1:05:12] xiaozaiz: doggo has no concept of defensive flash
[1:05:21] LordGlizzzington: damn google lied to me
[1:05:23] xiaozaiz: he only flashes forward
[1:05:43] Malundu: This is the LPL...you expect peopel to flash defensively, then go watch LEC or LCK lol
[1:06:21] monobeno: doesn't Uzi only have a single LPL title to his name?
[1:06:34] wontonsoup9000: why can’t I hold all these meta champions
[1:06:52] Malundu: I respect Uzi because he is one of the greats to play this game, but he hasn;t been the same after he had diabetes and a wrist injury
[1:06:53] monobeno: Even Jackeylove have more LPL titles than Uzi
[1:06:58] Blckrang3r11: Just bet $1000 on TT and I know nothing about league am I winning?
[1:07:14] J2easoN: if lpl is supposed to be best league in the world, people need to flash defensively. look at TL and bjergsen, he doesnt make many mistakes (miss some cs) but when i look at some lpl plays.. its just too chaotic to be good play
[1:07:26] dwanesuccan: MrDestructoid
[1:07:28] monobeno: Uzi is a great player, but when he was playing LPL was much weaker, yet he still wasn't able to win more than 1 LPL title

[1:07:43] goodboy_yanfei: MrDestructoid

[1:08:31] J2easoN: remember when bjerg clapped xiaohu ? yea i do
[1:08:45] Malundu: Bjergsen wouldn't be a top 3 mid in LPL
[1:08:56] Malundu: he's barely top 3 mid in NA
[1:09:02] monobeno: He wouldn't be top 10 in LPL bruh
[1:09:17] g40ge: Kick hacker to go playoffs
[1:09:26] J2easoN: who's better than him and hans sama ? rookie maybe
[1:09:38] bluesclues96: eucal
[1:09:41] hegemoonia: Bjerg fanboys coming to LPL chat to talk trash iwdINT iwdINT
[1:09:45] monobeno: Rookie, Xiaohu, Angel, Scout, Knight, Strive, Care, Fofo, Creme, Forge >>>>> Bjerg
[1:09:51] Malundu: Hans Sama is ADC
[1:09:59] Moobot: Stay up to date on all the important LPL news on our Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/lplenglish
[1:10:09] monobeno: Bjergsen wouldn't even start for any team in LPL LUL
[1:10:21] Orion_627: @j2eason NotLikeThis WutFace Kappa SeemsGood LUL
[1:10:24] Malundu: and I think Beserker in NA is better than Hans
[1:10:38] monobeno: Of course he is
[1:10:39] J2easoN: bjerg clapped xiaohu at worlds so hard.. please nooo rookie i can see.. but everyone else isnt known quantity
[1:10:49] monobeno: Berserker is like 3 times as talented as Hans sama
[1:11:17] Malundu: Bjerg beat Xiaohu one time and you guys think he's better based on that years ago lol
[1:11:21] kentuckyfan611: Hi Cody
[1:11:44] monobeno: Xiaohu is so much better than the Xiaohu in the past
[1:11:54] monobeno: While Bjerg is so much worse than the Bjerg in the past
[1:11:59] Malundu: TL tried to build a super team, but Bwipo and COreeJJ carry that team
[1:12:07] g40ge: I thought UP has 369 support
[1:12:19] J2easoN: xiaohu dropped off hard.. rookie isnt 2018 form either but still ververy good  - bjerg had break and still plays like the zil god we know from years ago
[1:12:38] J2easoN: and this time his adc cant int him.. hans is too consistent to throw like doublelift xD
[1:12:56] DarkPower9000: In Na it doesn't say much
[1:12:58] Malundu: Fudge is probably as good as Bjerg is and he's only played the role for half of a split
[1:13:12] monobeno: LEC still looks so much better than LCS even when their talent get stolen
[1:13:18] rankonemagee: yo
[1:13:20] Orion_627: @j2eason FBBlock
[1:13:23] monobeno: I'd say LEC looks decent this year while LCS looks trash

[1:13:31] TheOreoCupcake: UP BELIEVERS GIGACHAD
[1:13:46] kaoru_12: we cannot bet today?
[1:13:47] Malundu: LEC overall looks better than LCS, but I think C9 looks really strong and they have young talent
[1:13:48] J2easoN: lec looks bad this year..
[1:14:05] marinbalo95: gamba modcheck
[1:14:07] monobeno: Yeah, I think C9 looks to be by far the best team in LCS
[1:14:13] thegive: team liquid ain't bad

[5:02:45] Casondra_: So what constitutes a meme game next round? Fun champ select by RNG? Free picks for LGD by RNG not banning them out? Goofy throws/inting by RNG?
[5:02:56] flawlessrookie: @M012345678 who talked to you ?
[5:03:01] sephiroxical19981202: @rickehv Doinb?
[5:03:03] M012345678: @Casondra_ I'm free for anything :)
[5:03:06] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: LPL > LCK is true look at the past 5 years...
[5:03:11] bluesclues96: @flawlessrookie everyone
[5:03:28] flawlessrookie: @bluesclues96 not me
[5:03:28] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[5:03:29] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: but if we are talking Overall LCK and LPL might be debatable
[5:03:30] monobeno: What happened to Shadow? wasn't he a top tier jungler?
[5:03:32] Rater9: RNG gonna win that one also they don't want to risk
[5:03:37] holmn95: LEC  > LCK  >> LPL
[5:03:42] Rater9: Win fast and move on
[5:03:48] M012345678: Vibe
[5:03:48] bluesclues96: @monobeno in EU maybe
[5:04:04] TheOreoCupcake: RNG want to go home and Sleep early KEKW
[5:04:13] M012345678: @TheOreoCupcake So does LGD KEKW
[5:04:14] holmn95: @monobeno Nah he never was top tier in eu either
[5:04:15] bluesclues96: really wanted TT to win today
[5:04:37] TheOreoCupcake: @TheOreoCupcake @M012345678 OMEGALUL EZ Clap 25 min game
[5:04:45] monobeno: If Shadow wasn't top tier in EU, how did he get on a LPL team?
[5:04:50] bluesclues96: im glad EU is in LGD tbh, brings the LPL a lot of EU viewers
[5:04:53] discord_421: @monobeno He had one pop off split in EU, and a lot of his faults were covered by Humanoid. He was never that incredible before then.
[5:05:01] Casondra_: I'm getting so anxious for this game to start~! I hope LGD claps back with a 2-1 for this best of 3!
[5:05:02] monobeno: Why would LPL import average EU junglers?
[5:05:02] bluesclues96: @monobeno cuz of his parents i think
[5:05:31] pchen20: @monobeno cuz some team like saving money?
[5:05:33] d843: average EU jungler = low tier lpl jungler
[5:05:37] monobeno: His parents made a LPL team import him?
[5:05:49] 泫雅老公: That EU jungler is chinese tho
[5:05:50] spammingparrot: Dagda? LUL
[5:05:53] discord_421: @monobeno Because the middle/bottom tier teams of each region are not actually that far apart. Its at the top where the gap is obvious.
[5:05:57] TheOreoCupcake: ORANGEE WHEN DAGDA IS CASTING GIGACHAD
[5:06:01] bluesclues96: @monobeno i heard that his parents have connections, but im not too sure
[5:06:04] shakysheki: subs????
[5:06:07] pchen20: what kind of italian parents so powerful in china

[5:06:23] M012345678: @pchen20 Well he is partly chinese
[5:06:25] holmn95: His parents are chinese i think
[5:06:36] just_bottletop: WHO WIN???
[5:06:38] shakysheki: if that was xiaohusbvex lgd would win
[5:06:39] monkaspepe: shad0w is a 2nd generation chinese immigrant in Italy
[5:06:42] bluesclues96: @monobeno but then again, he is chinese, he isnt a white EU jungler
[5:06:42] 泫雅老公: maybe that's why they want to tryout shadow
[5:06:58] powdernotjinx: WHY THE FCK JAPAN LEAGUE HAS MORE VIEWS THAN LPL
[5:07:01] discord_421: @pchen20 China and Italy have a lot of economic connections. There was a reason why Italy was the Covid hotbed.
[5:07:02] spammingparrot: LGD won the Speedrun to their homes
[5:07:03] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: if RNG lose hypothetically where will you rank them in LPL 4th?
[5:07:03] just_bottletop: WHO WIN PLS

[5:07:25] bluesclues96: @discord_421 never thought about that, good point
[5:07:33] wzhidznz: bc chinese watch it in bilibili
[5:07:37] shakysheki: rng are better in red actually
[5:07:44] 我先放个夹子马克一下: LPL fans watch their own tube
[5:07:49] spammingparrot: @m012345678 I think its time to some chat filled with parrots? LUL
[5:07:59] 我先放个夹子马克一下: like Bilibili
[5:08:01] discord_421: @powdernotjinx Regional leagues are the fastest growing leagues. That besides, its RNG stomping a lower pack team. Not something that incredible to watch
[5:08:02] Rater9: RNG gonna have another clean game
[5:08:05] bluesclues96: omg shad0w couldve went to EDG, thank GOD
[5:08:13] 我先放个夹子马克一下: a
[5:08:15] Casondra_: someone barely beat me to betting on LGD first! lol

[5:09:02] ionutr2: LGD COMEBACK !!! 1-2 BibleThump
[5:09:03] shakysheki: kennen
[5:09:14] bluesclues96: huya has 15 million viewers when a top tier team is facing another top or mid tier team
[5:09:26] Rater9: @ionutr2 RNG won't risk getting into a tie
[5:09:31] pchen20: shadow is good if all you want is just a budget jungler, and even ldl jungler with potential is quite expensive these days
[5:09:33] Casondra_: Place your bets, folks!
[5:09:35] monobeno: @bluesclues96 For the last damn time, Huya does not show viewer count
[5:09:39] omnialicent: GG 2-0 RNG
[5:09:43] boya_UFC: 1-1 or 2-0
[5:09:47] monobeno: @bluesclues96 There is a huge difference between popularity score and viewer count

[5:10:13] Sanest_LeagueEnjoyer: I'm having a hard time who to support in LPL region just so good.. but right now I'm with WBG
[5:10:13] pchen20: the entire lgd roster simply tells you one thing thats all they want is saving money atm

[5:10:36] moggye: They all have faces only a mother can love crazy
[5:10:41] monobeno: @bluesclues96 the system in which Chinese stream platform use, instead of viewer count
[5:10:42] imakoji: lgss gonna win matchfiz
[5:10:53] captainkrajick: @bluesclues96 length of viewership + number of clicks
[5:10:57] Casondra_: @spammingparrot I'm from the East Coast of NA. :D
[5:11:06] monobeno: @bluesclues96 Twitch shows raw viewer count, Chinese platforms use popularity score, so that "15 million" is not viewer count
[5:11:08] captainkrajick: @bluesclues96 10,000,000 view score is not 10,000,000 viewers
[5:11:21] tixwho: @yoetus_carbrave that's not viewership unfortunately KEKW that's just viewing score
[5:11:22] xZyOs10: XIN Zhao 🙌🏻
[5:11:25] mxg2: @bluesclues96 popularity score is used instead of viewer count to combat botted views
[5:11:32] spammingparrot: @casondra_ Ohh I'm from Argentina. Our LLA is awful so I only watch LPL and PCS LUL
[5:11:35] shakysheki: wei xin gg

[5:11:54] omnialicent: @imakoji This is a serious accusation
[5:11:57] bluesclues96: @monobeno oh there's no words next to it, so i assumed the person icon = viewers
[5:12:13] bluesclues96: @mxg2 i see

[5:12:34] tixwho: understandable, chinese streaming platform is extremely tricky on viewership display
[5:12:36] captainkrajick: @yoetus_carbrave there is literally no viewership counter on chinese sites
[5:12:49] Rater9: @imakoji Why would RNG risk to get a free win close to securing 1-2nd spot
[5:12:57] tixwho: you can't really get the real viewership number as an audience
[5:13:00] spammingparrot: @hyunaismywife Not all teams haha. Humble teams and players... and I like the aggressive style
