[1:05:28] dancethenightaway124: @rickehv no
[1:05:37] HystericsCasts: Rookie of the split won't go to Zika
[1:05:38] alcatraz__2040: No gamba?

[1:07:08] monobeno: Anyway this whole situation has me very disappointed in Faker, as with a lot of my comrades
[1:07:08] HystericsCasts: I actually think because Xiaolaohu played acouple of games last split he's not eligible?
[1:07:13] dancethenightaway124: imo wayward rookie of the split
[1:07:15] coffeealien: Rich is technically a rookie in LPL so it's probably going to be him.
