[0:23:07] usedxsoul: @Merkry Please, GenG is still better than most of LPL
[0:23:19] haveoneonmoi: @Kingleoii what did iG revolutionize?
[0:23:46] 1557fan: @Kingleoii aggression game style
[0:24:09] 1557fan: @Kingleoii individual >> team ^^
[0:24:20] usedxsoul: @v5rookiie All of LPL has been playing with aggro for a while...it wasnt revolutionized by IG lmao
[0:24:32] MilkPlease: TT will beat V5

[0:27:06] Kingleoii: @lem0nade02 compared to lpl teams in terms of agressiveness where would you rank t1?
[0:27:11] haveoneonmoi: wait xiaohu laneswapped back mid? what a monster
[0:27:16] usedxsoul: Faker isnt the best mid laner like he once was, Zeus and Oner are okay and not inters, Which is why it works so well, They are all good players even if not the best, and then keria is insane and guma is great
[0:27:24] klausterz: BLG pls sell doggo
[0:27:27] nyankite: LUL

[0:28:02] GR0THYY: I hope 3 Games
[0:28:03] lem0nade02: @Kingleoii i think they are almost as aggressive as LPL but sometimes they are slow too
[0:28:07] ljpnb666: UZI VS DOGGO who wins
[0:28:08] 1557fan: @UsedxSoul I think you re fair  thats rare for t1 fan
[0:28:14] klausterz: @usedxsoul T1 is the best micro and macro game actually
[0:28:14] usedxsoul: Korea9 > All of LEC

[0:28:37] uylforlife30: I JUST REMEMBERED THE BULLYING T1 DID YESTERDAY.....
[0:28:43] 天使文安的水水: @UsedxSoul Faker might not be the best one. But his experience can help his team a lot.
[0:28:48] ph0enix_gryph4n: @Kingleoii That is why they win worlds
[0:28:51] lem0nade02: @uylforlife30 LUL

[0:29:17] 검은마음흑우: TSM WILL WIN THE WORLDS 2022
[0:29:19] Kingleoii: @lem0nade02 right so that slowness can cost them cause it would mean closure on the chances of winning a certain game...
[0:29:22] klausterz: UZI Perma Adc for BLG pls
[0:29:23] kelfunly: Guys serious question, is UZI playing today?
[0:29:28] 1557fan: 2019 t1 was supposed to win world then the 1557 incident came
[0:29:28] usedxsoul: @天使汶銨的水水 Well yea, Thats all im saying, Like faker/oner/zeus arent the best but they arent even close to the worst, They are smart players, even if they arent the best.
[0:29:38] lem0nade02: solobolo 😂
[0:30:03] Kingleoii: @ph0enix_gryph4n don't see it happening to be honest
[0:30:07] 1557fan: @UsedxSoul T1 as team >>>>>T1 as individual
[0:30:10] usedxsoul: It is only spring, Who knows how the meta is going to change by worlds, Its still way too soon to decide who looks the best going into it.
[0:30:13] lem0nade02: @UsedxSoul oner is great tho only second to canyon in LCK
[0:30:22] uylforlife30: @lem0nade02 zeus took it personally XD
[0:30:30] klausterz: @v5rookiie im support G2 on finals, but the fpx incident came
[0:30:37] AtomicOraion: @usedxsoul Oner is the second best performing jungler in LCK and Faker is probably the best mid this split since showmaker and chovy are having a rough split
[0:30:44] lem0nade02: @uylforlife30 whole team took it personally LULW
