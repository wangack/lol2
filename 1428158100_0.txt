[1:02:27] DuhLeeted: tian finally had a good series
[1:02:51] irlgigachad: hoping RA can win  to keep JDG down in the standings
[1:03:24] 泫雅老公: Why
[1:03:25] theomgfather: Cube will carry Prayge
[1:03:36] g40ge: why jdg in their yt channel has only hundred views they won lpl 2020 spring still underrated
[1:03:41] 泫雅老公: 369 will win
[1:04:08] theomgfather: 333333 Prayge
[1:04:16] irlgigachad: @泫雅老公 wbg fan, they're sinking but I believe they can fix it just need time which higher seeding gives them
[1:04:28] jetlagging1: RA's not gonna win
[1:04:58] jetlagging1: 369 will beat Cube into a circle
[1:05:12] 泫雅老公: true
[1:05:33] yooiva: hoping for some 3's today so ra can win
[1:05:43] leo5789: The shit..
[1:05:43] theomgfather: cube is so much better than 369 its not even debatable
[1:05:50] g40ge: now we know fofo isnt the carry of RA
[1:06:28] TheOreoCupcake: Cube GIGACHAD
[1:06:28] irlgigachad: these two teams do seem somewhat legit though where they have signature wins of late and could make playoff runs
[1:07:06] irlgigachad: @karsa369 idk about that, fofo-blg started the year off hot but then slumped. He's good but things got messy
[1:07:42] 泫雅老公: Because corki victor both got nerfed
[1:07:42] irlgigachad: said it many times, but I think uzi is a mistake and over complicates things. They were doing great with doggo

[1:32:12] discord_421: @yooiva Its because all the other teams look so weak that believing in T1 is so had. the 15-0 run isn't the same as the 2015 15-0 run, the league is a heavily 1 league team. And the only team that on paper be able to win vs them has had C ovid every time they've gone head to head.

[1:46:26] papayasmithy: its hysterics
[1:46:34] ragewrath72: looking back now 369 might have done a 5Head play and tanked his value so he gets traded out of TES KEKW

[1:54:35] ragewrath72: @ambraisbalanced the problem with yagao is he is only good on like 2 or 3 champs and he is sht on others so he becomes a liability come worlds
[1:54:39] Casondra_: Any mods here doing the game predictions? (I missed the last game start)
[1:54:50] TheOreoCupcake: Yaga OMEGALUL
[1:54:55] edgelordweeb: @sephiroxical19981202 yagao is good on like three champions rn
[1:54:58] ambraisbalanced: Yagao is like average slightly below average when it comes to LPL mids
[1:55:05] TheOreoCupcake: Very unreliable player, don't trust him if JDG make it to worlds.
[1:55:13] g40ge: Yagao beat knight in pingxiang cafe
[1:55:13] markgalvan: will jdg 2-0?
[1:55:19] edgelordweeb: strive >>> yagao
[1:55:54] bluesclues96: kanavi pog

[2:12:40] TheOreoCupcake: KEKW
[2:12:48] irlgigachad: @aaahahahahahahahahahahaha but when theshy does bad, it looks really bad and angels problem is that hes a ghost. But iirc HF is relatively consistent and still upper echelon
[2:12:50] g40ge: see
[2:12:59] iNTactWF: PPGOD GIGACHAD PPGOD GIGACHAD PPGOD GIGACHAD

[2:13:12] a999b99: MISSING HOPE
[2:13:17] 余傑陞: yu yan jia can see future
[2:13:22] omnialicent: Viper and Light not so good this split
[2:13:27] ye1l: light is the best ADC atm
[2:13:30] g40ge: I hate to see T1 beating v5 so i wish MSI will be postponed
[2:13:39] omnialicent: Btw, V5 has been so solid
[2:13:40] nacknack_nack: RA NO DAMAGE
[2:13:55] sephiroxical19981202: @omnialicent ???Light is definitely good this split
[2:14:00] captainkrajick: @omnialicent besides losing to JDG 2-0
[2:14:01] ye1l: @omnialicent ???? Light hasn't had a bad game lol he's literally 1v9 on LNG
[2:14:10] breongao: can you imagine no team want Rookie last year
[2:14:17] GautamKmr: light is playing the best on lng
[2:14:18] riitos: Light is perma 1v9 in LNG
[2:14:22] omnialicent: For me the best adc is Huanfeng
[2:14:25] captainkrajick: @omnialicent light is like the 2nd best player on V5?
[2:14:27] Casondra_: @NICNACKIE it's still early... give it time....and let's hope JDG don't stack up themselves...
[2:14:28] a999b99: ad 31 cs
[2:14:35] omnialicent: And with Kaisa back on meta
[2:14:37] g40ge: @breongao nahh just rookie refuse teams
[2:14:47] AKAROH: He didn't see that Kench W?
[2:14:49] mangomochee67: @breongao wdym he was stuck in IG
[2:14:56] g40ge: 3333
[2:14:58] jubraa: I like Elk as adc now hes is fun to watch imo
[2:15:08] bluesclues96: TTours
[2:15:10] ye1l: with how Viper has been playing and Huanfeng's last few series considered, Light is most definitely currently the best performing ADC in all of LPL
[2:15:11] nacknack_nack: @NICNACKIE YES SIR
[2:15:14] captainkrajick: TTours
[2:15:17] omnialicent: Elf very good but his team is awful
[2:15:42] GautamKmr: not true... best adc is still photic
[2:15:43] Casondra_: No live cameras on the players today?
[2:15:49] puckettttttttt: @ye1l betty underrated
[2:15:53] GautamKmr: any issue with V5 now?
[2:15:56] mangomochee67: @ye1l facts
[2:15:59] TheOreoCupcake: I think the best ADC in LPL in terms of skill are Light, Photic, Viper, Huanfeng and Gala.
[2:16:01] ye1l: like it's not even debatable that Light is doing extremely well atm. LNG wouldn't even have a chance of making playoffs without Light
[2:16:01] g40ge: @casondra_ hovid
[2:16:05] pyro_kertok: @Casondra_ played remotely. Covid
[2:16:06] irlgigachad: @ye1l took him so long to reach that, happy for him
[2:16:07] riitos: @Casondra_ remote cause of covid
[2:16:14] shakysheki: @ye1l dont forget gala
[2:16:17] 余傑陞: no live cameras that why whom playing?

[2:16:42] g40ge: CUTE
[2:16:46] ruC1: thebausffs
[2:16:46] ye1l: In terms of skill the best ADCs are Viper/JKL but skill is obviously far from the only thing that makes a player good

[2:17:17] lem0nade02: cube = babus KEKW
[2:17:19] irlgigachad: like i remember with snake how hyped up light was this was snakes prodigy to follow jkl / iboy, he had the rank 1 kalista god going on, but just never manifested in pro play
[2:17:22] KrzoOn: @WillItbe imagine its one of the best picks in current meta, and hyperscaling
[2:17:28] xaxaxaxaxa_xaxaxaxaxa: !score
[2:17:28] TheOreoCupcake: @bluesclues96 I meant mechanics + current form.
[2:18:11] GautamKmr: enough about best adc, who is the worst adc in lpls ?
[2:18:12] bookjun: @ye1l ADC is up to their team aswell, Light play well almost every games but his Jungle and Top are dogshit
[2:18:14] bluesclues96: @TheOreoCupcake ah.
[2:18:15] chikgila: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:18:15] ye1l: @bluesclues96 yeah mechanics. Viper and JKL are still completely untouched in that aspect, in the world even. JKL is just lacking in the brain department

[3:56:47] unrequitedIove: @sephiroxical19981202 benched KEKW
[3:57:02] pchen20: @worvansuns nah just go watch their first seed 0-6 S10 speed run, while the whole world playing fast TSM had to stay super slow due to he cant change his slow play style after all those years
[3:57:04] magikaki: TT has 2win pog
