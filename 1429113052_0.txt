[1:51:41] mrinterpret: Rich is def having a better split
[1:51:54] wzhidznz: @Hechyyy do u know who is best jg in the world?
[1:52:04] irlgigachad: @ye1l mechanics subpar no doubt, but it shows he understands the game, how to win and that was the case for 2020. ON just seems like he will never get the nuances complexities of the role and put them in bad predicaments at times
[1:52:22] Hechyyy: @wzhidznz well its for sure not tian thats certain
[1:53:08] ye1l: @mrinterpret Rich was less useful than TheShy in both game 2 and 3 in their series though... And he literally won game 1 with a hard counter and raw coinflip lol
[1:53:13] wzhidznz: @Hechyyy tian is best jg in the world 369 is best toplaner in the world
[1:53:18] ye1l: Rich is just not it

[1:54:07] ye1l: he's mid tier, he's pretty much a worse Cube backed up by rookie who has perma prio so Rich can go for illegal plays/trades permanently because of rookie
[1:54:09] wzhidznz: @Hechyyy whatever,TES is best team in the world
[1:54:21] AKBouse: @ye1l  The shy early jungle pressure cheese only worked a few times. V5 were not ready for it. Other teams countered it now ppl know what to expect

[1:56:39] Hollow_Alliance: if TES goes to worlds, Tian & JKL into again :)
[1:57:11] ye1l: I'm a LPL fan and I haven't cared about LCK since Khan was popping off on LZ and even I can admit that T1 is just better atm. Oner+Keria claps every jg supp duo in the LPL. Unless Wei+Ming hit 2021 spring form it's hopeless
