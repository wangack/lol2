[1:07:24] edward_zhou: uzi who can't play aphelios vs doggo who can only play aphelios
[1:07:26] MarxVendetta: @泫雅老公 how? He only played Jinx and they never drafted around him. Huh?
[1:07:28] 泫雅老公: UZI cannot play aphe. Cannot play zeri well. Of coz BLG will have bad draft
[1:07:37] tvc0101046: Never played Aphelios KEKW

[1:08:42] 泫雅老公: T1 adc in this patch is jinx/aphe/zeri. Uzi can only play jinx. How the team gonna make good draft?
[1:08:49] papayasmithy: is today last day in regular split?
[1:08:53] MarxVendetta: That is irrelevant to BLG having bad drafts. Everytime I've watched their P&B it has been horrible. You're blaming Uzi for, weird @泫雅老公
[1:09:19] edward_zhou: @泫雅老公 what is their alternative? play doggo? KEKW
[1:09:28] captainkrajick: @papayasmithy no we have the OMG series starting from tomorrow until Wednesday

[1:11:59] rokara123: You know BLG gonna drops one game when they let doggo play ResidentSleeper
[1:12:24] mimiolimii26: is doggo that really bad guys?
[1:12:27] 我只會玩賽恩: liang0Dc liang0Dc liang0Dc liang0Dc liang0Dc liang0Dc
[1:12:28] MilkPlease: @rokara123 better than almost dropping the series LUL
[1:12:40] Rhimeth: OOOO
[1:12:41] 假的紅樂: I love Uzi but he's not in his prime anymore. Why should a team always playing around a ADC who's weaker than Viper?
[1:12:46] rokara123: I smell fixing
[1:12:47] MarxVendetta: @mimiolimii26 nope.
[1:12:53] Rhimeth: OSFrog
[1:12:55] keithchupot: lgd wins
[1:13:06] edward_zhou: @mimiolimii26 he got gapped by every competent adc this split
[1:13:10] mimiolimii26: where is uzi?
[1:13:18] MarxVendetta: Horrible drafting by both teams
[1:13:34] frake_lol: uzi is finished like my idol pessi 😢
[1:13:37] mimiolimii26: who got better draft guys?
[1:13:40] g40ge: No EU jungler sadge
[1:13:47] shedo_47: over 28 min kinda good bet no?
[1:13:58] 一蓑煙雨: @mimiolimii26 Doggo is good.
[1:14:00] MarxVendetta: @假的紅樂 Who would they play around tho? Regardless their comps are never favorable for anyone.
[1:14:02] 當河馬是魯魯咪: Doggo>>>Uzi
[1:14:03] h011ywood: jayce needs to get ahead or he will fall really behind
[1:14:10] metal_over: Not true, Uzi was always ahead in term of CS and kill event they lose the game
[1:14:10] 尬電歐逆醬: Doggo GO! Taiwan fighting!
[1:14:13] g40ge: wheres the former MAD Lions Jungler??
[1:14:17] mimiolimii26: who got better draft?
[1:14:18] tendotata: no under 28!!
[1:14:19] rokara123: @milkplease ya I hope they don't drop the whole series
[1:14:20] MarxVendetta: @mimiolimii26 BLG's is easier to play.
[1:14:22] h011ywood: if jayce cant get early kills, its not good
[1:14:49] demiyrggermanec247: where's NL?
[1:14:56] g40ge: Prayge
[1:15:04] mimiolimii26: @marxvendetta the hero they used? im not lol fans im just put money here im dota 2 player
[1:15:05] gibwck: No Uzi again? :(
[1:15:06] MarxVendetta: Voli seems so out of place with Leblanc, Aphelios and Jayce tho.. Don't know what Weiwei is attempting
[1:15:09] CJDM310: what are the stakes of this match?
[1:15:16] peler1222: DOGGO monkaS
[1:15:17] swagger_meister: @pandal0z lol this is going to go over over over
[1:15:21] 假的紅樂: @metal_over that's because when Uzi plays, Weiwei spend all his time makes sure that Uzi is ahead. a tactic that doesn't pay off.
[1:15:26] proera8: No uzi??? NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:15:27] ratayusi69_kekw: Uzi=useless
[1:15:45] g40ge: No Shad0w??
[1:15:56] demiyrggermanec247: why did both toplaners not take tp tho
[1:16:08] metal_over: Uzi need more synergy . He was not playing bad
[1:16:14] 負號: no uzi can win
[1:16:16] MarxVendetta: @假的紅樂 It doesnt work because they dont have a comp that works around Uzi, and Weiwei keeps playing horrible champs around TFs. It has nothing to do with "ganking bot".
[1:16:17] sys7ematiic: NO UZI NO WIN
[1:16:24] h011ywood: they will be splitting
[1:16:26] 鼠餅の蛋餅: NL>>>>>>>Doggo>>>>>>Uzi

[2:04:04] the_color_coral: LCK waiting room you up?
[2:04:06] hideonbush1912: let UZI play
[2:04:08] cuprehan: mb ig i mistyped
[2:04:10] rjless: Uzi in which team?
[2:04:14] sadgeday: How do we know which player is acutally playing without camera? Maybe Uzi is playing but with Doggo name 4Head
[2:04:17] tvc0101046: ResidentSleeper
[2:04:21] kraken_aphelios_enjoyer: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:04:23] MarxVendetta: @cuprehan So maybe Harold wasn't the play to do and Uzi knew that but because the whole team was claling it he was hasitant. Would you say that's "poor macro" and if so by whom?
[2:04:24] Dandingt: ResidentSleeper
[2:04:26] naoprecisaleronome: AZIR ResidentSleeper
[2:04:46] kraken_aphelios_enjoyer: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:04:46] 295234852834: UZIR FUNgineer
[2:04:52] joshg0sh: Imagine prior for uzi, 70 years old hand
[2:04:52] CheeseChico: Bedge
[2:05:04] demiyrggermanec247: gamba?..
[2:05:15] MarxVendetta: @cuprehan I don't remember the game. But I do agree, like I said before, that his still rusty from all this time. I'd still put him above Doggo (even tho I don't blame him for anything BLG's problems are).
[2:05:20] bruliira: UZI ??
[2:05:35] cuprehan: @MarxVendetta well it was never clearly stated that was the case obviously but if that is why then there is a much bigger problem if they are pushing him around in comms like that
[2:05:41] bruliira: CADE O UZI  ??
[2:05:58] cuprehan: @MarxVendetta i can try to find the game if you wanna look at it
[2:06:07] lfishl: @MarxVendetta you are talking simple thoughts which are still beyond their level KEKW
[2:06:09] naoprecisaleronome: na casa da sua mae
[2:06:23] dhquang: DOGGO GAMING
[2:06:23] MarxVendetta: @cuprehan There's clearly an eggo/miscommunication problem based on their "behind the scenes". Besides they're a "new" team.. takes time to acomodate to each other.
[2:06:32] bruliira: @someoneniceandclean ofensivo T.T BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:06:45] MarxVendetta: @lfishl KEKW
