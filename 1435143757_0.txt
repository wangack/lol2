[2:42:55] sandyclawz: @Casondra_ I have everything EsportsCapsule2022 can give and still got over 50 spares.
[2:43:31] imaflyingcat45: is this playoffs already?
[2:43:44] M012345678: @imaflyingcat45 No, playoffs start on saturday :)
[2:43:44] plb79: no
[2:43:45] Casondra_: @sandyclawz I was wondering what happens when/if you collect all the rewards.. How many can you even get? What can you do with extra?
[2:44:18] imaflyingcat45: @imaflyingcat45 k thank you ^^
[2:45:12] will92153: Hi
[2:45:53] sandyclawz: @Casondra_ If you watch every main, drop eligible stream from start of the season to the finish, you can get over 100 capsules in a year before worlds. First 15-20 will give you all the rewards.
[2:46:29] sandyclawz: From there, any surplus capsules you get will start giving you copies of the loot table it has
[2:46:43] sandyclawz: any spare icons and emotes will be added to your loot table.
[2:47:17] TheOreoCupcake: AUX OISIN Pog
[2:47:40] ajimarco: One Piece 1044
[2:47:48] sandyclawz: Spare icons you can immediately turn into orange essence, emotes however, are unable to be turned into OE directly, only if you have ALL the store bought emote collection, you can re-craft them into store-bought emote spares
[2:48:03] 甘草米77: doin shit
[2:48:52] sandyclawz: From there, you can also turn them into orange essence. If you don't have all the store-bought emotes, they will be rerolled into store-bought emotes without a chance to turn them into OE
[2:49:37] sapojf: F DRX
[2:49:44] Casondra_: Oh, neat. Thanks for the info. You're amazing~! @sandyclawz

[2:51:20] TheOreoCupcake: ABLE EZREAL KEKW
[2:51:24] crushy92: boring draft
[2:51:28] sandyclawz: @Casondra_ Any time. Drops are a great way of getting OE. Also, if you have missed any previous seasons content, they also get added to the current Esport capsules loot content. For example:
[2:51:36] TheOreoCupcake: @basedjayrr Not for LNG. Decider for OMG.
[2:51:39] Beijxst: Is this BO5 or BO3?
