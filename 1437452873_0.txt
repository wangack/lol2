[1:10:06] CorporalPibb: I play dwarf fortress so gameplay
[1:10:07] Geeesus: do you like tiny tina's gameplay, is it worth getting?
[1:10:10] Nenod: @flatpackedcorgi gameplay is always king - stuff like Vampire Survivers, Loop Hero, Get Over It etc prove it time and again. in a way even Elden Ring - which is still full of bugs and some say less graphically pristine compared to the Horizons and the GOWs, but it's just way too fun and it will still get GOTY no matter all the imperfections.
[1:10:11] AdamBadr1: yeah gameplay for sure
[1:10:12] flatpackedcorgi: good point
[1:10:12] Asna: You mean Valheim? not valhalla

[1:13:02] Nenod: @flatpackedcorgi i agree, they kinda have aspects of the game that will please all From fans, even those of Bloodborne and Sekiro - there is gamplay in there for them too. and the open world actually has many places where it's not quite that open and you will still get your "fix" of feeling trapped, unable to run from the challenge and helpless :)

[2:22:22] Scott389: he pushed the minions so he got 2 first
[2:22:32] Jukettaja: I guess there's a lull in games

[2:25:01] Jukettaja: I had that playing League as well.
[2:25:08] Jukettaja: It would randomly cut internet for a split second.
[2:25:18] AinzN: There is jsut too much salt in League that the cables get congested
[2:25:23] Mrshilka: the league ac?
[2:26:32] Jukettaja: At least Garen has infinite sustain
[2:26:38] Jukettaja: So no amount of poke gets him out of lane
[2:26:47] AnnieJella: Garen passive doesnt break if he shields the dmg right?
[2:27:57] Ribbons_Almark: gj

[2:33:38] Lutcha81: let's see if it work out for him
[2:34:27] AinzN: I remember back before memes were a thing people would just quote Dodgeball and Anchorman at each other all the time
[2:35:25] quicksen: i like the lore of league but i have no ide of what the hell im looking at
[2:35:43] Ribbons_Almark: we been playing ranked all day?
[2:35:50] papporo: hey chat :D
[2:35:51] AinzN: Ribbons_Almark this is the second day

[2:36:27] Ribbons_Almark: @ainzn ah kk, ty!
[2:36:51] AinzN: Ribbons_Almark first game was a quick win but this one is a lot more rough
[2:36:53] Maklen5050: good fight
[2:36:57] KiDtaztic: this zeri is just bad
[2:37:28] AinzN: Wait they have that little evil magic zappy guy?
[2:37:39] AinzN: Haven't seen him all game!
[2:37:41] afreak10: team chat muted ?
[2:37:48] AinzN: afreak10 yeah all muted
[2:37:49] Keyah: It looks like Nocturne isn't building AS? cirThink
[2:37:54] afreak10: NODDERS NODDERS
[2:38:48] Ribbons_Almark: lmao
[2:39:23] afreak10: surrender vote
[2:39:24] gunstars20: LUL
[2:39:30] AnnieJella: If you vote after 20 it might work
[2:39:35] AnnieJella: Doesn it?
[2:39:38] afreak10: cohhFail
[2:39:44] Ribbons_Almark: I'm waiting for a Zeri skin I like, she is cool
[2:39:46] P0rtilo: if the vote ends after 20 it works
[2:40:21] Keyah: Hostage cirSlain
[2:40:34] Jukettaja: At least League has surrender option
[2:40:35] the_real_beardcat: some people like to suffer
[2:40:43] AnnieJella: Biggest issue is depending on teammates YEP
[2:40:45] Jukettaja: Dota 2 was hard for me when it had no surrender option
[2:40:52] PiriSetae: I feel ya, just got help hostage in a 4v5 with an afk since one guy wont ff
[2:40:53] afreak10: Dota have no surrender
[2:41:43] KiDtaztic: it would be one thing is they were playing better and coming up short. But eh maybe timers can win you the game
[2:41:44] Ribbons_Almark: that should totally be reportable  if it isn't an option, taking people hostage in games
[2:42:21] Mondo_Gibbs: 5 min cd
[2:42:22] scooterjr37: it is
[2:42:23] Keyah: It's the same if someone's tilted, they need out to recoup. There's no way out of games for those that need/want out w/o penalty cirBlech
[2:42:24] KiDtaztic: nvm rip
[2:42:28] Maklen5050: LoL needs a dynamic FF, where if you down certain gold amounts at certain points, the surrender vote is easier.
[2:42:29] P0rtilo: 3 min between ff no ?
[2:42:43] shatteredsaint: the madness returns?
[2:43:16] Invess: new content idew
[2:43:17] AinzN: We go again!
[2:43:30] orestes____: people can hold you hostage in unwinnable games, but inting in them gets you banned :D
[2:43:37] P0rtilo: @Maklen5050 Nah, it's already a great system as is. 15 unanimous, 20 4v1. The problem is the players
[2:44:12] afreak10: if the player is the issue , should be an offense when the game is lost
[2:44:39] Ribbons_Almark: yeee
[2:44:46] the_real_beardcat: league of lessons
[2:44:47] Darkwolfiex: how did jp find tiny tina wonderland

[2:45:29] NotYourLad: i've honestly been playing a lot of TFT recently to scratch some of my league itch without feeling like i have to commit my full attention to the game when just trying to chill
[2:45:30] sunflower204: I mean you are how good you are regardless of your rank, the rank is just smoke and mirrors.

[2:46:59] LazyNekos: Silver is also a weird spot cause you can have some with silver skills or some that just play against diamond and plat all the time
[2:47:04] gunstars20: Rip Jungle diff

[2:50:49] AinzN: yellgler he didn't. He wasn't enjoying it
[2:51:03] yellgler: thanks @ainzn
[2:51:23] AinzN: Wasn't there a guy who used to get paid a load of money to be a pet food taster?
[2:53:01] woofser: Bird food is probably alright. It's just seeds

[2:56:17] garry_leonard: I also love watching you hate people
[2:56:18] Keyah: In the name of the moon he punished you cirHappy
[2:57:53] scooterjr37: if he lands toss you lose the trade
[2:58:03] NotYourLad: he prob couldn't kill you because of your passive tbh, wave came in too slow
[2:58:43] beardedge3k: Vote surrender?
[2:58:54] AnnieJella: You rolled that le blanc
[2:58:57] AnnieJella: That was nice
[2:58:58] afreak10: nice kill tho
[2:59:03] KiDtaztic: nice kill tho
[2:59:04] P0rtilo: Good shutdown money though
[2:59:11] NotYourLad: might be a good game for defensive boots tbh
[2:59:26] Pain240: is the ranked reset ? @itmeJP
[2:59:26] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:59:30] sunflower204: you know that rammus is no good when he gank top and fed to tower.

[2:59:50] Rdei: cohhStare what did you just call me?
[2:59:52] Ribbons_Almark: this is what league does to people
[3:00:25] NotYourLad: ez and vex can carry this for sure
[3:01:38] AnnieJella: they prolly coming
[3:01:40] AnnieJella: from herald
[3:02:03] AnnieJella: Rip top tower Sadge
[3:02:50] AnnieJella: Rammus could be the solution to this urgot
[3:03:24] BroqRox: lol
[3:03:28] NotYourLad: vex and bot lane are so far ahead that rammus will become useful if he just roams with vex tbh
[3:03:37] NotYourLad: all he has to do is taunt for them
[3:03:54] BroqRox: someone died?
[3:03:57] BroqRox: yep
[3:04:34] BroqRox: urgots pokes are great
[3:04:37] br4nd0nh347: urgot is fun and strong
[3:04:40] garry_leonard: JP hasn't played any urgot yet?
[3:04:42] PinkButtonFunnyMan: !rank
[3:04:42] itmeBOT: As of January 23, 2022, JP is Silver IV in League of Legends (playing Top). This is his second season ever; JP started his League journey in October 2021 and his previous season high was Silver I.
[3:04:49] NotYourLad: he's good but if he gets put in an early hole he struggles a bit
[3:05:01] NotYourLad: if he gets an early kill into tiamat then he gets annoying fast
[3:05:19] garry_leonard: Urgot is like tahm khen, with less team fight, but stronger lane push
[3:05:47] AtheistVeganNihilist: How’ve the games been?
[3:05:59] NotYourLad: bot prob rotating top
[3:06:02] Jukettaja: Always fun when you get towers
[3:06:29] Jukettaja: Lets face it. What every top laner really wants to do is PvE
[3:06:38] Jukettaja: Push waves and take towers.
[3:07:10] NotYourLad: if you can get tower then it'll be fine
[3:07:15] NotYourLad: early inner is good
[3:07:21] Rdei: 3k
