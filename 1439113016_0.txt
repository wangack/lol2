[3:50:20] Lepointcentral: @theclamdestroyer as 2nd item ?  for me there is a  diff between void 2nd item and 3thd item. Having flat magic pen vs % is not better in 2nd item. Lyandries  provide 15 magic + sorcerer boot 18 + 45% void  = 47  With shadow flame instead you got between 43 to 53 but with more ap and more health.  Void staff is 3rd item better
