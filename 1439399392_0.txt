[0:48:07] DD_The_Shmey: Loki was perfect though
[0:48:14] andaroo: Too short, too long, pacing issues FeelsBadMan
[0:48:17] ThemDemo: They spend 4-5 episodes on average building up to end up having one episode trying to tie all the knots as well as have huge action set pieces. I think that is the main problem I have with the shows.
[0:48:31] TheSerifM: Netflix went WAY too long and I guess now they’re over- compensating
[0:48:37] Archangel3003: I really enjoyed Hawkeye honestly. Though I enjoy anything about archers.
[0:48:41] ThemDemo: Not to say I don't think the shows are good. They are better than most shows I watch
[0:48:56] andaroo: Yeah Disney tried to shorten Daredevil Season 2 and 3 and Netflix wouldn't let them per contract
[0:49:11] ReginaldXIV: How is Jessica Jones not in the 18+? that shit was dark
[0:49:12] LFC_Letters: its 16+ in the UK now
[0:49:39] Hundisilm: Isn't Jessica the darkest of them?
[0:50:06] DD_The_Shmey: yeah it was pretty dark
[0:50:07] LeelandGrant: Content wise for sure, but i think it is not very grafic
[0:50:31] Malanor85: @LeelandGrant Punisher got that covered
[0:50:32] Poobzee: I think Punisher is darkest
[0:50:33] seekthepwn: can you will smith that cat
[0:50:33] LeelandGrant: Jessica has very mature themes, but does not show the real bad stuff on screen
[0:50:36] Frost0555: @andaroo like take away episodes?
[0:50:45] KatjeMauw: miauuw
[0:50:52] TickleTheCohh: cohh3 Monitor is a balance beam for cats.
[0:50:58] quaxim: i hope this show is good. I am interested in completely new MCU content
[0:50:58] jmj1987: MYAAA
[0:51:04] vaelindreth: meowriPause
[0:51:08] LFC_Letters: the episode titles were also released too if you wanna see those
[0:51:13] DD_The_Shmey: the main bad guy in Jessica jones dealt a lot with non-consent stuff, you know, his powers were mind control, and he messes people up
[0:51:21] Malitor: does that count credits though?
[0:51:25] LeelandGrant: yeah, looking forward to it
[0:51:32] Malitor: Credits are usually 8-10 minutes
[0:51:56] Malanor85: MYAAA STRAAANGE
[0:51:58] ThemDemo: Critics saying that its so different from typical MCU makes me excited
[0:52:23] andaroo: What If danKEK

[0:52:42] ReginaldXIV: Clap
[0:52:42] WDForty: the more "realistic" their MCU show the more meh it is, the more "out there" the MCU show the better it gets
[0:52:44] DD_The_Shmey: ahh, I thought Hawk Eye was good
[0:52:46] DD_The_Shmey: I liked it
[0:52:55] DD_The_Shmey: Loki was the best though
[0:52:55] Hundisilm: I liked Hawkeye a lot more than the bird one :)
[0:53:02] KatjeMauw: funny how the "worst "what if" were my favo, and the best were my worst
[0:53:05] Hundisilm: it had some charm
[0:53:16] LFC_Letters: i mean its just captain carter and strange so far
[0:53:47] Ravnim: I just want Jeffery wright's the watcher in life action marvel
[0:53:57] Hundisilm: that sounds good

[0:56:03] Tyronin: Loki is real good tho
[0:56:04] Frost0555: Yeah not referencing other MCU stuff all the time is good

[1:03:35] Frost0555: @spacedive thats what i thought too
[1:03:36] bakavic: didnt the director spoil the post credit scene?
[1:03:39] Kyanilis: Oh I'm absolutely going to see Morbius and I expect it to be awful
[1:03:46] Hundisilm: Aren't spooderman movies ok?

[1:04:06] andaroo: the post credit is really bad
[1:04:13] andiago: KEKW
[1:04:15] Archangel3003: I've seen people saying that Jared Leto refused to do reshoots apparently and that's part of the reason. @itmeJP
[1:04:18] WDForty: Marvel has some crative control with the main Spiderman movies in the MCU
[1:04:18] b0ksah: savage
[1:04:23] berzerker_rage: Yeah Morbius is so saddening. This movie looks like a train wreck. Sony's shitty writing seems unable to kill these flicks
[1:04:31] akmannen: the spiderverse is good
[1:04:34] rapidshot20: this seems so bad I think I need to see it
[1:04:41] andaroo: Yeah this is not a Pascal movie, Pascal does Venom, Spider-Man and Spider-Verse
[1:04:43] ThemDemo: Jesse because they don't care, they make the movies to keep the rights
[1:04:45] Poobzee: Spiderverse is the only one
[1:04:47] Drakoni23: Except Spiderverse which is a miracle cause that was after the EMOJI movie
[1:04:50] raptorscream: Imagine Tom Holand Spider-Man, without Marvel hands in it
[1:04:57] Heisuisui: a lot of nepotism getting in instead of talent
[1:05:03] berzerker_rage: Venom 1 was ok, writing was rough, but not Venom 2 rough.
[1:05:04] m3rcer: Spiderverse is only exception i think
[1:05:17] andaroo: NOpe
[1:05:18] Drakoni23: It's hilarious
[1:05:20] aznhai: where can I read these reviews @itmejp

[1:05:28] Barrh: they reeeally want to be in the mcu without being in the mcu Kappa
[1:05:28] SKEWR13: How bad does it have to be to have horrendous post credits?
[1:05:29] ThemDemo: It's good discussion points
[1:05:29] Frost0555: Yea I like the Venom movies
[1:05:31] LFC_Letters: Sonys already tweeting about it KEKW

[1:05:48] DD_The_Shmey: yeah the venom movies were alright
[1:06:26] ThemDemo: I can whisper you the leak JP if you want
[1:06:29] andaroo: That's not in the movie
[1:06:31] Drakoni23: OH also a lot of the shots from the trailers are apparently NOT in the movie. Just here to bait people
[1:06:33] raptorscream: that's the creditr scene
[1:06:35] andaroo: none of the KEaton trailer footage is in teh movie
[1:06:44] berzerker_rage: Yeah it's him getting out of prison for post credit scene 1 @itmeJP
[1:06:44] Poobzee: wait so he pops up in prison in the other dimension?
[1:06:56] berzerker_rage: Scene 2 is where he comes back in full outfit @itmeJP
[1:06:59] pc2400: Maybe trailer scenes are fake for hype
[1:07:01] Poobzee: he just happens to show up the exact place lol
[1:07:16] andaroo: @itmeJP people are mostly complaining because there's no logical reason why Tooms would move to an alternate universe, that's not how No Way Home works danKEK
[1:08:16] Archangel3003: But everyone that came to the main universe in No Way Home got sent back...?
[1:08:17] ThemDemo: And also why Adrian would hate spider man at this point, not knowing who he is now, and also why would Morbius give a FUCK about spiderman?
[1:08:19] berzerker_rage: Morbius wasn't part of the sinister 6
[1:08:22] Drakoni23: They even already established variants possibly looking the same. Why not just have him be a variant instead of breaking the multiverse?
[1:08:24] raptorscream: isnt Scorpion at the end of 1?
[1:08:33] El_Zilcho22: Because it doesn't make any sense?
[1:08:35] bakavic: what beef does morbius have with spiderman?
[1:08:46] andaroo: Because Tooms gets sucked into another universe but that's now how Strange's spell worked
[1:08:48] Legionnare92: WHY WOULD MORBIUS JOIN THAT GROUP?
[1:08:48] LFC_Letters: They use the NWH spell but completly dont understand how it works at all KEKW
[1:08:56] ReginaldXIV: It's tha spidah man
[1:08:57] Dastorn: This is why we can't have nice things
[1:08:59] Legionnare92: sry caps haha
[1:09:00] ThemDemo: There is no logic at all in these post credit scenes, they do not make any logical sense for character motivations
[1:09:02] Frost0555: @bakavic he has good movies and morbius doesnt Kappa
[1:09:21] El_Zilcho22: why does he care about this universes spiderman if it's not the one that messed with him.
[1:09:23] andiago: huh
[1:09:26] Legionnare92: NotLikeThis
[1:09:29] Ageisfang: that makes no sense
[1:09:31] m3rcer: Wait so Morbius knows Peter Parker is Spiderman?
[1:09:32] Poobzee: ugh
[1:09:41] raptorscream: Venom/Morbius world dont have a Spiderman, since Venom only reacts when he sees MCU Spidey... so why is there?

[1:09:59] Legionnare92: what the hel is happening
[1:10:00] Dastorn: Sony is just peeing into the well at this point
[1:10:01] Poobzee: WTF
[1:10:15] Devlind: what Sony is doing is just so weird, it just feels like a huge money grab
[1:10:16] Drakoni23: And apparently the scene with the Spidey in the background is not in the film Jebaited
[1:10:17] Poobzee: "hey wanna be evil with me" "sure"
[1:10:24] ReginaldXIV: I think the BTS reason for these post-credits is that Sony and Disney had a fight over Spider-Man rights
[1:10:25] Archangel3003: 1) How does he have the suit. 2) How does Morbius even know Spider-Man. 3) Why would Morbius even have beef with Spider-Man?
[1:10:26] Legionnare92: i need to know what psychadelics Sony execs have on hand
[1:10:27] Sonatta: jared leto can't catch a break with super hero movies
[1:10:31] berzerker_rage: Sony just needs to stop. You know how much more money they could make if they just gave the IP to Marvel.
[1:10:33] Crafteroon: The villains ended up in MCU because they knew who Peter is, yet Vulture goes to a different universe for the same reason?

[1:11:38] berzerker_rage: @ThemDemo Sad thing is, they're just going to keep making them. They already have Madame Web in the works, and Kraven is filming now. :(
[1:11:38] raptorscream: Bronze loves Jared's Morbius, HATES Wanda
[1:11:58] raptorscream: good one Jesse

[1:12:54] SpaceDive: they should have dropped this in january
[1:12:57] Berrgerrs: Greatest movie ever made\
[1:12:58] riot_vision710: Me neither
[1:12:59] berzerker_rage: @ThemDemo Yeah, I'm not going to see them. I eventually watched Venom after it was released and went to digital.
[1:13:02] andiago: best rom com i saw last year NODDERS
[1:13:07] ReginaldXIV: Disney regained the rights to MCU Spider-Man so Venom 2 and now Morbius make no sense lol
[1:13:07] kherbb: NODDERS same
[1:13:08] freaktechnik: at least the first venom is much better after you've seen let there be carnage
[1:13:14] Hundisilm: Is Jared Leto actually a good actor?
[1:13:21] shadowoflight_: omg I kept hearing Jesse while watachint let there be carnage
[1:13:22] Archangel3003: But how???
[1:13:26] akmannen: its spiderbruh
[1:13:27] CozyConn: Garfield?
[1:13:28] SeekoBlastar: Toby?
[1:13:32] berzerker_rage: Yeah, I watched Venom 2, and the writing was so bad
[1:13:34] larkhill: its spiderpig
[1:13:36] pc2400: But Venom didn't know what spiderman was
[1:13:37] Hellbinn: but it wouldnt be same one so whats point ha
[1:13:40] bakavic: so how did venom not know about spiderman until no way home??
[1:13:42] NeonFlux: Dark Knight woops wrong show
[1:13:43] LFC_Letters: Andrew you saved yourself... dont ruin it agin
[1:13:45] freaktechnik: it'll be a cartoon animated spider man
[1:13:46] NeonFlux: DarkKnight

[1:13:50] DD_The_Shmey: yeah
[1:13:54] TheRhymenoceros: ew
[1:13:54] ReginaldXIV: Would Andrew Garfield even come back if it wasn't MCU?
[1:13:59] Drakoni23: As much as I want to see Garfield again, I'd hate for him to be screwed over AGAIN
[1:14:02] Legionnare92: but then why does adrian have beef with a diff spiderman? he has to knwo its not his ?
[1:14:03] El_Zilcho22: i don't want any spiderman in that universe
[1:14:03] berzerker_rage: If Sony is involved with any of the writing it's just going to be garbage.
[1:14:05] GrannySith: But would he take the role at this point?
[1:14:07] Drakoni23: Hope he knows better now
[1:14:07] andiago: NotLikeThis dont do this to him
[1:14:11] ThemDemo: @berzerker_rage yeah same for me. Sony only wants to ride on the MCU's coattails without doing any work. The only reason the Holland Spiderman movies are good is because of Marvel Studios, not sony. Sony just wants money with no actual work put in
[1:14:11] andaroo: @Stalker2400 Venom says at the end of Let there be Carnage that he has "multi-versal" info, that's how they explain it
[1:14:20] ReginaldXIV: Sony's animation team is 10/10 though
[1:14:23] Archangel3003: Sony needs to stop making superhero movies
[1:14:24] Drakoni23: Andrew for Spiderverse on the other hand tho! That would be dope

[1:14:43] gorlork: March 30th here in Sweden
[1:14:50] berzerker_rage: @ThemDemo Which kills me, you'd think they would just hand it all over keep your name on it. ,Keep distributing the films, and collect your money.
[1:14:51] KosmicKing78: My brother's birthday lol
[1:14:51] Ageisfang: i'm going on friday, fully 100% expecting it to be the joke of a film that it is
[1:15:01] riot_vision710: So you thought this was a real movie...  haha April fools

[1:15:41] Drakoni23: Can we just not go watch Morbius out of curiosity and not give them money?
[1:15:44] Hundisilm: It shoudl be Spiderman: The Madam Web Story to do well
[1:15:46] Archangel3003: Sony are really going all in on Spider-Man which as a character has only been really successful not being under Sony LUL
[1:15:47] WDForty: ppl who watched the 90's cartoon know who she is

[1:15:49] Ageisfang: wouldn't a madame web movie *have* to be a spider-man movie?
[1:15:50] ThemDemo: @berzerker_rage I think the reason why they don't is Pascal and Arad being prideful
[1:15:51] Poobzee: @LeelandGrant spiderverse Thanos basically
[1:15:55] Sonatta: it's not even going to be OG old lady madam web that people know...
[1:16:00] Crafteroon: Morbius released on April Fools so they can try to do a Snyder cut later, the joke is there is no saving that movie.
[1:16:05] Malkieri: I really want to see Kraven linked to Spidey.
[1:16:15] freaktechnik: sony cinematic universe is a weird board room concept.
[1:16:15] Barrh: doesnt kraven need spiderman? hows that gonna work

[2:10:04] afreak10: "sends bill to Nvidia:
[2:10:05] Hundisilm: Comes with its own power plant
[2:10:06] svensonidis: @Rikez probably MTP cable, since it's 100Gb/s over 100m
[2:10:08] Hundisilm: bundled
[2:10:09] AinzN: Jammies Jammies Jammies
[2:10:09] thepumpdaddyc: Mhm
[2:10:13] WDForty: a lot of IRL IT network managers watch LTT, so these kinda videos help sell shit in the business world
[2:10:13] PsychoMet: 100 meters for a Gig ethernet. 10+ gigs requries a lot of power and if copper is necessary it's just couple meters
[2:10:15] MythGameStream: Yeah, I got a 3K Watt UPS and it shows on my electric bill.
[2:10:15] DD_The_Shmey: @Legionnare92 They are building Skynet
[2:10:19] verysleepyexe: @MesquiteBear it's more than just yt now. ltt is huge
[2:10:19] BlazeRom: it's a nutty server
[2:10:20] Adventos: PepeLaugh
[2:10:21] ZcottD: 12 kilowatts a second of power
[2:10:25] ProSkilz58: @MesquiteBear they don't, they probably gonna make a ton of videos on it and eventually return most of it. They state in an old video a lot of the crazy stuff gets returned based on the deal.
[2:10:26] Darkaros: strongest modded minecraft server
[2:10:28] Legionnare92: @DD_The_Shmey oh cool cool
[2:10:29] ultimateannihil8r: YouTube clicks and bragging rights.

[2:10:37] afreak10: in a few years , Linus builds a super computer
[2:10:42] LighterTripod: so he can put all his porn in one place
[2:10:52] MesquiteBear: @ProSkilz58 oooo
[2:10:53] Anathel: it will be also a trad show thing for the suppliers
[2:10:53] Denimco: The things people do for NFT's these days
[2:10:53] Xaamatu: They do TONS of video editing especially with 4k and 8k footage.
[2:10:59] svensonidis: nah, that's just for the compute server
[2:10:59] BlazeRom: idk my brain is just melting from those specs

[2:11:10] SFWildBill: Small General Service: $0.1173 per kWh. Medium General Service: $0.0906 per kWh. Large General Service: $0.0567 per kWh.
[2:11:14] Mr_Shadow_commander: 512 core / 64 per server = 8
[2:11:22] The_Jux: they just have a little future proofing now
[2:11:24] Joshdread: Is JP going to do any Guilty Gear again now all the S1 characters are out?
[2:11:26] Kaleith: they're not keeping it, most of the hardware is going back
[2:11:29] Truder2k: power cables were rated at 30 Amps 240V, 2 cables... soo 14.4 kW
[2:11:31] JustSomeGamer: So, they;ll turn it on - and half of Canada goes into a brown out.....
[2:11:31] d_schizzle: was that so Linus can upload his consciousness?
[2:11:34] Liminaly: 4x 3000 watt PSU on the one server
[2:11:39] boxofpants: don't you run into limits of power you can pull for a small office building
[2:11:59] Starlorn: As a farmer our drier runs as 50 amps per phase standard, that's 25kw a phase
[2:12:01] Anathel: they have a workshop with welders etc
[2:12:03] Rikez: @Rikez That would make sense. I was thinking just regular ethernet.
[2:12:04] Hundisilm: @boxofcraniums I would think you would store this in a server farm
[2:12:12] raptorscream: @boxofcraniums Linus base is a warehouse
[2:12:19] thepumpdaddyc: @itmejp luckily they switched over to solar power for their building so the electrical bill will be fairly low /S
[2:12:26] tmn8: @itmeJP weta digital (vfx company) has giant server rooms like this and they take weeks to render some scenes
[2:12:27] RhodesToRome: monkaW
[2:12:31] woofser: WutFace
[2:12:37] ok_juju: some of the PSU units where for redundancy
[2:12:37] IAmCrossLed: They are in CA, and I know they just ran solar to his house, so maybe the building as well.
[2:12:39] ZcottD: that would be 3.50 to 4 bucks an hour at US power rates
[2:12:47] Starlorn: 12kw isn't much really
[2:12:54] Kaleith: @thepumpdaddyc they don't have solar on their building, Linus is getting solar for his house
[2:13:06] Justice98405: Hello JP and chat.
[2:13:09] thepumpdaddyc: @kaleith hence the /s
