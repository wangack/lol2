[0:27:13] DyingEros: Hey at least 6.1 is on the way with more in the pipeline
[0:27:14] cruxk__: What are they chances they announce a new switch for this game?
[0:27:15] ultimaprinny: 2022 is definitely the year where we can clear out our backlog games
[0:27:16] Devlind: what if the reason they delay it is to come out with a new switch at the same time? I can hope
[0:27:17] Mrshilka: @Altair900 Alt! ijpH

[0:29:21] Altair900: you can make fun of something and then still play or do said thing
[0:29:22] TheChristopherG: pre-ordering a mobile game DansGame
[0:29:22] KAWS__: it will be good on a ipad pro
[0:29:29] Darkaros: this is why JP makes fun of the Witcher 3, his secret game of the year
[0:29:31] JBfromAccounting: @itmejp hell,maybe Microsoft will get the Android apps on Windows shit working, then it's just Diablo on Windows
[0:29:39] OuroborosChemist: @00oniking00 well it 4 year old pc doesnt rly run med settings at 60fps on 3440x1440p i'd play etc Elden ring on ps5 instead but it think i can get geforce 4k gpu before i can get ps5

[0:29:54] Gnomeleader213: you're gray....
[0:29:54] Yozki: I dont see how they'll compete with Lost Ark and PoE and stuff
[0:29:56] epicshoo: ijpSUFFER

[0:30:05] Zoldaire: I can't get excited about any Blizzard game anymore. They're all just meh
[0:30:05] SZebra: Is the MTX model for Diablo Immortal known yet?
[0:30:07] SilvaeAmo: It does look a bit dull
[0:30:08] BillZeBub13: wasn't too much color the problem last time?
[0:30:08] espi: that's the point, everyone hated D3's satured look
[0:30:09] quaxim: did you play whatever was a few months ago @itmeJP
[0:30:11] Deathevan: so if I make fun of you I deserve a VIP and not a ban?
[0:30:13] Thebestbubbles: a dark aesthertic can be interesting but this just feels empty to me
[0:30:13] quaxim: I thought they had a demo
[0:30:14] CarrotWhisky: People complained Diablo III was too colorful, so back to greyness
[0:30:14] KDRushby: bit of green mixed in there
[0:30:17] Kultak: and very D3 just shiny
[0:30:18] InsanityRequiem: It's a reversion to their "colorful" D3.
[0:30:18] Mrshilka: some poe level are incredibly bright
[0:30:19] Zizen: hopefully its some weird HDR setting thats not capturing well
[0:30:20] Xzaven: this looks like the first view to diablo 3, where everything looked bland
[0:30:20] epicshoo: PoE's issue is blue on blue on blue on blue
[0:30:21] NoorElBahrain: ijpD
[0:30:25] Adept_Zeno: D4 better have some crazy good story if the gameplay stays how they've showed so far

[0:30:52] BlueSapphyre: even the brown looks grey.

[0:31:20] SpaceDive: ijpHMM
[0:31:21] Narnun: @itmeJP why did you think Diablo 3 flopped so hard? I personally quite prefer the gameplay to PoE
[0:31:24] Kymix: thanks for the answer
[0:31:25] ritchie313: does it feel cluncky, maybe cuz alpha
[0:31:25] Adept_Zeno: @Zoldaire  yeeeaahh i guess not these days

[0:31:39] CorporalPibb: art style wise, it's very PoE like
[0:31:41] Kymix: UHMM
[0:31:41] Mrshilka: wanting to show this publicly boggles me
[0:31:42] zerohour_88: KEKW
[0:31:42] 0ldnslow: Why is Immortal taking so long to release
[0:31:43] Wchillinman: LUL

[0:32:05] VeloRama: wtf is this LUL
[0:32:05] RybackStun: PoE*
[0:32:06] Shoaron: this is not a good showing imho

[0:32:06] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[0:32:08] MythGameStream: 4x 3090's in SLI
[0:32:13] DrTazerFace: The critics are out in force today
[0:32:17] Kymix: it is very underwhelming for me
[0:32:21] JBfromAccounting: @narnun it actually got really popular after the exact, it flopped in the beginning because of the real money AH n stuff, and the end game was meh
[0:32:26] Mrshilka: shadows is cool
[0:32:28] VeloRama: nice looting demonstration KEKW
[0:32:28] SpaceDive: Hmm
[0:32:31] Dangazak: color? modCheck
[0:32:31] epicshoo: Hmm
[0:32:36] JBfromAccounting: exact=expac
[0:32:38] Anterak: It would be cool if they highlighted what the focus of the test footage is.
[0:32:40] Wchillinman: NOPERS Only gray and browns
[0:32:42] Korlane: night? so day/night cycle?
[0:32:45] Vander_Mitch: 3090ti is 4 slot wide lol
[0:32:49] SirCris: People didn't like all the colors in D3, they wanted this dark and gritty atmosphere
[0:32:50] InsanityRequiem: I would have preferred in game sound over this music.
[0:32:51] VeloRama: looks like Dark Souls Kappa
[0:32:53] Qwayne84: Diablo 4?
[0:32:53] DrTazerFace: I actually liked D3
[0:32:56] ChosenDark1: it's pre-alpha color doesnt come in until at least alpha UHMM
[0:33:01] itz_just_camel: just tuned in what game is this? looks sick
[0:33:06] Narnun: town seems big
[0:33:07] NoorElBahrain: D4
[0:33:08] EthicaTank: d4
[0:33:09] SirCris: all the colors are in the skills
[0:33:10] Layercake: They already try color in D3 and things didn't went very well Kappa
[0:33:16] pykseldot: Color will be available in one of the content patches later down the road.
[0:33:17] itz_just_camel: thanks chat
[0:33:19] SchnellBier: D3 had good parts but also had a lot of fundamental issues
[0:33:20] sunflower204: POE2 have better art direction
[0:33:20] Alanthesheep: When is D4 due out again? Imagine if it was the same time as PoE2 that would be a bag move
[0:33:28] Alanthesheep: *bad
[0:33:30] MythGameStream: Illegal Tinting
[0:33:30] Nemm__: It looks boring without things to explode
[0:33:31] VeloRama: does this game not have fighting?
[0:33:31] n1rri: They're trying to emulate PoE it feels because it's popularity
[0:33:33] LokiCanadian: I don't think we will be finding much color in D4. To much negativity about D3
[0:33:35] epicshoo: monkaSHAKE
[0:33:38] Mrshilka: its moving
[0:33:41] itz_just_camel: i dont think this area is for you JP haha
[0:33:42] Zizen: still think it could be a HDR setting thats not capturing well
[0:33:43] JaxRebel: thats dark
[0:33:45] Shoaron: monkaSHAKE
[0:33:45] ultimaprinny: They probably showcasing the lighting?
[0:33:47] SilvaeAmo: Looks better?
[0:33:47] HannHannBann: ijpMONKA
[0:33:47] CarrotWhisky: Oh, this looks good.

[0:33:48] sunflower204: now this I like :)
[0:33:48] VoltecZero: Caelid Pog
[0:33:51] countmarcula: Cool, now show what it looks like when there's 1000 enemies getting gibbed and abilities being spammed
[0:33:51] InsanityRequiem: In game sound! Hurray!
[0:33:53] Mrshilka: mmm gold sound
[0:33:54] pocketdimension: can it stay forgotten?
[0:33:55] itz_just_camel: too many legs
[0:33:56] Sathias: I'd want to forget that place
[0:33:57] Xzaven: After playing D3 through once, i put the game down and never got back to it. The story was so bad i couldn't forgive the game
[0:33:59] Vander_Mitch: look like my basement !
[0:34:03] quaxim: still so grey
[0:34:04] SirCris: @Alanthesheep I think they are planning POE2 to release whenever D4 releases
[0:34:07] BobbiTheDragon: what game is this?
[0:34:10] Thrishmal: That lighting is dope
[0:34:10] pykseldot: Diabloy or Diablowie?
[0:34:11] xence: ya this place gives off D1 D2 vibes
[0:34:12] KDRushby: god damn i hate bugs with a passion
[0:34:13] Dangazak: D: muh vase
[0:34:16] espi: spider legs
[0:34:17] darktall: act 4 poe
[0:34:18] FashionablyLate_: looks like a slow path of exile with nicer lighting
[0:34:22] MythGameStream: @itmeJP Reminds me of the first time I played Path of Exil.  So dark.
[0:34:26] InternetPlumber: the tentacles are the anime influence
[0:34:28] Narnun: it's Cthulu instead of Diablo this time?
[0:34:30] Korlane: can't wait for another generic spider boss
[0:34:30] epicshoo: Illaoi? Hmm
[0:34:33] Narnun: I wonder what the story will be
[0:34:41] Lord_Beardmeister: super kawaii hentai boss for sure
[0:34:43] Narnun: and god forbid it's 4 acts short story again
[0:34:43] NoorElBahrain: squidward is the boss
[0:34:44] yrvengalied: LUL
[0:34:45] MistyCooky: yeah this looks too dark, it's hard to really see anything
[0:34:49] Thrishmal: I wonder if you can carry a torch
[0:34:49] Adept_Zeno: i guess they really liked the look of the harvest in poe
[0:34:52] itz_just_camel: @Korlane wait they have had spider bosses in games before?
[0:34:54] Narnun: if they pull another D3 I don't know what to do with them
[0:34:58] 00oniking00: @OuroborosChemist i use a 32' tv for my monitor so i play most on 1280x720p or 1920x1080p and its fine for me
[0:34:59] Alanthesheep: @Alanthesheep That would be interesting to see what happens with the play base and with non sponsored Twitch streamers
[0:35:03] Narnun: they better have 10 acts in this
[0:35:03] dreddreplicant: druid looks cool
[0:35:06] Dangazak: widepeepoHappy druid
[0:35:07] KelticNight: Hasan Druid
[0:35:07] Nemm__: Ryuid
[0:35:10] nimrickz: widepeepoBlanket
[0:35:11] itz_just_camel: i have never played a diablo game before cant wait to try one
[0:35:14] Arcmourn: what game?
[0:35:27] JBfromAccounting: @kelticnight heads too big for that
[0:35:28] OuroborosChemist: @00oniking00 yea higher res chunks frames
[0:35:29] ritchie313: maybe it is becuase weve all played poe but man this feels like a crawl its slow
[0:35:34] Buttzyy: ijpREPORT
[0:35:41] Narnun: still lacking in colour
[0:35:50] DrTazerFace: Is PoE on console?
[0:35:50] sourbeamttv: POE is just so far ahead of diablo
[0:35:52] KelticNight: @JBfromAccounting the helmet has a lot of extra padding in side, makes his head look larger LUL
[0:35:52] itz_just_camel: is POE that much faster than D3?
[0:35:53] Altair900: I kinda like it being slower than POE though
[0:35:56] sourbeamttv: it will never compare
[0:35:57] pykseldot: no skills being demo'd which include movement skills
[0:35:58] ZcottD: league start in poe is a crawl too though
[0:35:58] Mrshilka: lol yeah even diablo 3 you moving at massive speed
[0:36:00] Shoaron: LUL
[0:36:04] Kryptorchid: why is the shadow pivoting around the character model?
[0:36:08] WisePython: D4 will have mounts, though, or did that change?
[0:36:08] Dangazak: also the best NODDERS
[0:36:14] Zoldaire: @ZcottD Only for the first 2 hours though
[0:36:14] Xzaven: i see no flood yet :D
[0:36:15] Lord_Beardmeister: LUL 100
[0:36:15] CarrotWhisky: No, that would be the auction house.
[0:36:16] Wildskunk: the worst thing to happen to diablo is diablo 3 imho
[0:36:18] BlueBloodBlues: jay wilson was
[0:36:20] WalkSkyluker: PoE demos are slow too though. This is presentation stuff
[0:36:21] SchnellBier: well poe is also not perfect the game is so fast that playing together is pointless
[0:36:24] BlueSapphyre: need like a lantern on the character.
[0:36:27] LokiCanadian: Even POE devs want POE2 to be slower. Its the god of war remaster concept all over again.
[0:36:28] bakavic: holy shit, I actually nodded off for a sec
[0:36:31] KelticNight: isn't "Flooded Depths" an actual PoE area?
[0:36:32] Devlind: so PoE 2 or Diablo 4 first to release?
[0:36:33] FashionablyLate_: idk man, blizzard has already spent the last chance it had with me. I really dont feel like i can stomach their games anymore
[0:36:35] Thrishmal: I ma loving the reflections
[0:36:36] KDRushby: @Kryptorchid serious question?
[0:36:37] cruxk__: Does Diablo allow the customization like Poe does?
[0:36:38] countmarcula: It's kinda hard to judge without seeing any combat :P
[0:36:42] SpaceDive: ijpSIP
[0:36:43] Thebestbubbles: I think its a little weird to only give your kids the grey crayons and ask them to design every area for you
[0:36:46] JBfromAccounting: lol I can't go back to D3 after playing POE, too damn slow
[0:36:46] itz_just_camel: is diablo always this dark?
[0:36:47] epicshoo: @bakavic mopCaffeine
[0:36:47] Dangazak: POGGERS
[0:36:48] Mrshilka: @cruxk__ traditonaly no
[0:36:48] NoorElBahrain: nice
[0:36:55] Madude89: Poe took a long while to surpass D3, but GGG kept grinding
[0:37:00] ZcottD: @Zoldaire ya but we dont know what gear if any these chars in the video have so actual play could be faster
[0:37:00] Darbee: its all just so dark. We seen like 5 colors
[0:37:04] ftwNatsu: what's the actual appeal in POE? honest question, everytime I watch a POE stream all the streamer does is spam spacebar and 1 skill while killing hordes of monsters
[0:37:09] EmperorMethos: @itmeJP Seems like Diable knows it can't compete with PoE on showyness of effects so it focusing more on atmosophere
[0:37:10] VeloRama: @itz_just_camel the first one was pretty damn dark
[0:37:11] Alanthesheep: Verticality is a good thing. I like it
[0:37:16] JaxRebel: kind of scary how far off d4 launch seems to be
[0:37:21] Xzaven: @Darbee maybe once enemies are there it will be a bit more color?
[0:37:26] Mrshilka: @ftwNatsu that IS the Appeal
[0:37:30] LeroyGankins: @ftwNatsu numbers go up
[0:37:31] Dangazak: they could have edited that into one video NODDERS
[0:37:35] Zoldaire: @ZcottD You're right. But the footage they released for this quarterly update is very unimpressive
[0:37:35] countmarcula: @ftwNatsu the build to make the space bar effective
[0:37:40] CarrotWhisky: Numbers go brrrrr.
[0:37:41] Thrishmal: I feel like Diablo has never been super colorful
[0:37:46] espi: POE is like a clicker game
[0:37:49] ReginaldXIV: The fun part is building the character so you can press that one button
[0:37:52] Devlind: numbers and loot thats it
[0:37:52] SlipCrit: i def prefer havign more than 1 spell buit thats just me LUL
[0:37:55] Mrshilka: d2 had alot of colour
[0:37:55] nimrickz: diablo was red and black
[0:37:59] VeloRama: @Thrishmal have you played D3?
[0:37:59] CorporalPibb: don't need to the complex rotations for the big dps
[0:38:00] LeroyGankins: dopamine go brrr when exalt noise
[0:38:02] JoeyGripps: monkaW
[0:38:04] De4dMaNz: yeah based on the viewpoint and the region the game takes place in, its not like there should be lots of natural pop in color there tbh, looks great for wat it is
[0:38:11] Marcloure: I guess grinding for loot is also part of the appeal
[0:38:13] SirCris: Caelid
[0:38:13] Kymix: poe is the stress tester for a gpu
[0:38:14] itz_just_camel: ah see i like that it isnt so dark
[0:38:17] TheChristopherG: color Pog
[0:38:17] FashionablyLate_: @ftwNatsu that's an actual issue with the game, devs are very aware of it and during the last few years have been taking small and steady steps to turn it around, make the gameplay more active etc
[0:38:18] epicshoo: i can feel the scarlet rot monkaS
[0:38:19] Thrishmal: @Thrishmal Yeah, but I remember it being fairly drab.
[0:38:23] sunflower204: the appeal of POE is building the skill and then see it work.
[0:38:27] Dangazak: @espi how can you say something so controversial yet so true LUL
[0:38:34] Alanthesheep: PoE is my go to brain off kill shit game
[0:38:35] ReginaldXIV: Are we going through the ruins of Tristram for a 4th time though?
[0:38:36] ftwNatsu: @SlipCrit yeah same for me, that's why I find diablo much more fun and why I could never get into POE
[0:38:39] yraelvaint: I feel like you can break down any game into saying its a clicker game if you don't enjoy the other aspects of it.
[0:38:44] Mrshilka: horrible framews
[0:38:45] Runner027: Runner027 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months!

[0:38:51] ReginaldXIV: Will Act 2 be the desert?
[0:38:52] VeloRama: 50 shades of grey KEKW
[0:38:58] Mrshilka: Lut Gulam , maybe
[0:39:00] SlipCrit: imma be honest i liked how colorful D3 was and this is liek opressively dark anneLol
[0:39:03] NoorElBahrain: I always like the desert areas
[0:39:10] Dangazak: I think I saw green POGGIES
[0:39:10] KelticNight: it's no Diablo: Immortal NOPERS
[0:39:10] FashionablyLate_: sadly i dislike the way they're handling endgame bosses very much lately. Every boss feels like a set of minigames/gimmicks you have to get through to beat
[0:39:11] freedout: itching ma scarlet rot.
[0:39:13] notlongtillDawn: Some of those locations look like poe2 hahaha
[0:39:13] SpaceDive: yeah seems they are going for a bleak color set
[0:39:15] Madude89: A2 must be a desert, it's the lore
[0:39:17] sourbeamttv: Imagine this trying to compete with POE 2
[0:39:36] CorporalPibb: yeah
[0:39:37] tyriaan: yep
[0:39:37] Nemm__: in D3, ye
[0:39:38] Thrishmal: Yes
[0:39:38] KatjeMauw: yea
[0:39:38] Shoaron: ye
[0:39:38] Kirino20: yes
[0:39:38] itz_just_camel: is it worth going back and playing D3 for someone who has never played it?
[0:39:39] BlueSapphyre: yes.
[0:39:39] Devlind: yea
[0:39:39] NoorElBahrain: yes
[0:39:40] epicshoo: ijpPRAY
[0:39:40] Mrshilka: heaven is act 4 yes
[0:39:42] Kaleith: act 4
[0:39:43] Arcmourn: LUL
[0:39:43] espi: yep there's an Act in heavens
[0:39:45] KelticNight: in a little row boat?
[0:39:47] ReginaldXIV: Man Diablo 3 had a stupid story
[0:39:49] Zoldaire: @Madude89 A2 being a desert is an unwritten rule for ARPG games. This is the way
[0:39:49] Shoaron: and the dersert area
[0:39:57] VeloRama: jupp. d3 is heaven. d2 is hell
[0:40:02] espi: there's a city act
[0:40:03] copycoffeecat: i hated the barbarian areay more
[0:40:04] markbart1: yeah and the one in the mountains / cold area
[0:40:06] Sheal88: way too bright on me peepers
[0:40:08] Arcmourn: d3 heaven was trump tower
[0:40:22] pykseldot: People pissed and moaned about how D3 was colorful and lacked the "darkness" of Diablo/Diablo 2. Blizz over corrected on D4.
[0:40:22] swiftybean: Silver City iirc
[0:40:23] Xzaven: @ReginaldXIV story was the main reason i quit that game right after playing it through once. I couldn't bear experiencing that a second time...
[0:40:25] sunflower204: POE2's art direction is just better imo
[0:40:32] NoorElBahrain: I liked monk and crusader in D3
[0:40:43] copycoffeecat: only ios or android as well?
[0:40:43] ReginaldXIV: doodMash
[0:40:46] Mrshilka: Crusader was my jam in d3 NODDERS
[0:40:46] epicshoo: monkaSTEER roll out!
[0:40:48] dreddreplicant: LUL
[0:40:50] Darkaros: based and gachapilled
[0:40:51] VeloRama: barbarian goes brrrrr NoorElBahrain
[0:40:52] espi: KEKW
[0:40:53] CorporalPibb: LUL
[0:40:54] Kaleith: credit card's already getting charged, beware
[0:40:54] Zoldaire: ijpLAUGH
[0:40:55] Wchillinman: KEKW
[0:40:57] JaxRebel: Desperate
[0:40:58] JoeyGripps: LUL
[0:41:01] oaktree3: thats their openi g?!?!?!
[0:41:03] NoorElBahrain: VeloRama CrungoSpin
[0:41:04] the043: I also laughed hard on that number LUL
[0:41:06] espi: looks like a Raid Shadow Legends parody
[0:41:07] Deathevan: N OMEGALUL
[0:41:09] Kasekaibr: augment your preorder
[0:41:09] VeloRama: NoorElBahrain LUL
[0:41:10] Shoaron: idk if there are 30million phones in the world ijpONO
[0:41:13] IceColdFrozen: no, just no.
[0:41:13] SZebra: Not gameplay Sadge
[0:41:14] itz_just_camel: bigger than LA?
[0:41:15] CanadianEevee: Microtransactions lets gooooo!
[0:41:18] ReginaldXIV: Play a real mobile game like... Genshin Impact
[0:41:19] zerohour_88: mobile is BIG
[0:41:21] InternetPlumber: more or less than candy crush is the question
[0:41:22] 0ldnslow: Can I use my JoyStick
[0:41:25] Zizen: make me stop playing jenshin
[0:41:26] sunflower204: this is just easy money
[0:41:32] itz_just_camel: well in that case im in
[0:41:34] Shoaron: comperable since its on mobile
[0:41:35] CarrotWhisky: Absolutely; mobile gaming is huuuuge.
[0:41:36] Sheal88: that casting animation LUL
[0:41:37] fells: i just cannot see how this is fun :\
[0:41:39] Xzaven: hey lost ark is the best mobile game on pc currently
[0:41:41] ReginaldXIV: I'll try it, hope it works on emulators
[0:41:46] SZebra: My phone probably can't handle it so I'm out.
[0:41:47] markbart1: it will prolly be huge in certain countries
[0:41:48] Cal_197: the classes look a bit too similiar tbh
[0:41:55] zerohour_88: mobile gaming is literally more than PC and Console combined so it won't be surprising LUL
[0:41:56] Arcmourn: frame rates sucked
[0:42:02] Lutcha81: this is just selling nostalgia in phone form
[0:42:04] gigamesh00: wheres the battle pass trailer Kappa
[0:42:14] espi: @zerohour_88 marketing budgets, not revenue
[0:42:17] Nemm__: Iirc, the MTX is upgrade materials and battlepass
[0:42:19] SZebra: Yes, there is a Battle Pass
[0:42:39] IceColdFrozen: so Immortal will come out, then when it stops making enough money they will release D4
[0:42:41] Mauldidnothingwrong: Wasnt there a cosmetic shop?
[0:42:46] Nemm__: I would think it has a similar monetisation as Lost Ark
[0:42:54] WisePython: attacks will cost mana/energy, and you will need to buy a bundle of potions for real money, probably
[0:42:56] UnboundSouls: @IceColdFrozen correct
[0:42:59] espi: this is hard to watch
[0:43:09] ReginaldXIV: If it's like other similar mobile games, the HP and damage of the mobs will be so oppressive and you'll be so undergeared that you'll start thinking about paying money
[0:43:13] Deathevan: lol
[0:43:17] zerohour_88: @zerohour_88 hm...when you google gaming revenue it shows 50% or more is mobile, so I dunno, if you say so
[0:43:21] Dangazak: CrungoSpin
[0:43:22] IceColdFrozen: 'discover' = buy, right?
[0:43:22] the043: become the biggest whale that ever whaled
[0:43:23] UnboundSouls: why release AAA games when you can make gachas with the same IP
[0:43:31] KelticNight: think it's like LA where you can throw money at it to get stronger
[0:43:31] neggst: what i wanna know is.. what about the people that don't have phones?
[0:43:33] SZebra: It looks so slow compared to D3 and PoE :(
[0:43:37] gigamesh00: unleash your wallets!
[0:43:39] EthicaTank: ive heard nothing but good things from ppl who played it tho
[0:43:41] Cal_197: if only it was on PC..
[0:43:44] Zoldaire: @neggst Guess you better go buy a phone then ijpLAUGH
[0:43:44] Devlind: did they announce what the money grab is in the game?
[0:43:46] Deathevan: this is the future of gaming
[0:43:47] ErikThe_Viking: It just looks like diablo 3 tho
[0:43:47] oaktree3: how is this diff from other action games on mobile?
[0:43:56] ZcottD: some of it looks good and some of it a bit too cartoony to me
[0:43:56] UnboundSouls: it isnt
[0:43:57] ThisHereGames: emulators inc
[0:43:58] thrillhouse451: I wonder if I can use my backbone for that
[0:44:04] Xzaven: @oaktree3 it's named diablo! :D
[0:44:07] the043: it has the diablo IP, that's about it
[0:44:13] ReginaldXIV: as far as I know it's a reskin of a different Netease game
[0:44:22] quaxim: lol
[0:44:24] Thrishmal: Looks stiff
[0:44:29] epicshoo: PepegaPls
[0:44:33] quaxim: its so slow
[0:44:35] Mrshilka: its d3 but less
[0:44:37] UnboundSouls: KEKW
[0:44:39] Dangazak: gamepay Kappa
[0:44:40] KatjeMauw: oaktree3 a bit harsh but true, its a reskin into diablo3 looks
[0:44:41] Mrshilka: but on your phone
[0:44:44] Xzaven: i am not impressed
[0:44:48] TheChristopherG: does it have auto-play?
[0:44:51] ThisHereGames: looks generic enough I guess
[0:44:51] dreddreplicant: looks like what a mobile diablo would look
[0:44:52] AinzN: I'll probably check it out
[0:44:59] Cal_197: it will be one of the biggest phone games ever
[0:45:06] ReginaldXIV: I'm more interested in PoE mobile
[0:45:08] The_Faceless_Void: not like any other mobile games to grab my attention
[0:45:08] Mrshilka: I will wtch Jp play it
[0:45:12] oaktree3: def big in teens of today
[0:45:15] SpaceDive: ijpSHRUG
[0:45:16] Vasar: I swear I just heard a goblin noise from oblivion LUL
[0:45:19] Marcloure: @oaktree3 I mean, that is like asking what is the difference between Arena of Valor and LoL: Wildrift. Same genre, different takes. AoV is much faster and explosive, Wildrift is slower, more tactical, has vision control, etc.
[0:45:22] InternetPlumber: don't forget about china
[0:45:23] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP the Fps makes me want to vomit almost
[0:45:25] Devlind: it looks alot like a game I watched a while back, cant remember what it was
[0:45:27] Shapelessdnb: Shapelessdnb subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hey and good day to JP, mod & chat!

[0:45:30] WATERMELONFRESH: People underestimate how huge the mobile market is LUL
[0:45:32] Mauldidnothingwrong: "Diablo Immortal will have a Battle Pass. Plus in-app purchases found in the game either serving as cosmetic items or things that will complement gameplay." So yea game pass at least
[0:45:34] m3rcer: I mean it dont need the diablo crowd
[0:45:39] UnboundSouls: we have PoE, last Epoch now
[0:45:39] m3rcer: jsut needs a slice of the mobile market
[0:45:41] yrvengalied: question mark ?
[0:45:46] Kaleith: deckard cain is in great danger and he needs your help, to help him all we need is your credit card number, the 3 numbers in the back and the expiration date
[0:45:48] Ap1werks: you all own phones right?!
[0:45:48] KatjeMauw: true
[0:45:49] Alanthesheep: Have we heard much about where PoE mobile is at right now? I can't recall
[0:45:51] dreddreplicant: it wont need diablo fans
[0:45:53] DD_The_Shmey: dylanburnsCowJAM
[0:45:54] Rdei: even if this game ends up as a flop, mobile games just make way to much money
[0:45:54] Marcloure: Well, poeple in China prefer mobile games
[0:45:57] ThisHereGames: chinese market will carry it
[0:46:00] ReginaldXIV: Play a real mobile game like Nikke: Goddess of Guns or whatever
[0:46:01] InternetPlumber: people who watch twitch are not the target audience for mobile games
[0:46:04] oaktree3: the general public thinks that mobile games and predatory microtransactions are normal.
[0:46:05] Heracy: The whole thing was a PR nightmare, but I am still gonna play Diablo while I go to the bathroom
[0:46:05] ReginaldXIV: AYAYA
[0:46:05] InternetPlumber: unless its genshin
[0:46:06] Xzaven: CoD players will play any single CoD game, and are fine with yearly new games that dont do anything well :D
[0:46:09] Dangazak: there are so many mobile players that it would make money anyway
[0:46:12] Cal_197: BLIZZARD fans dont care about getting screwed over with this
[0:46:16] Mauldidnothingwrong: Diablo 4 was delayed to 2023 right?
[0:46:17] yrvengalied: Yup
[0:46:22] dreddreplicant: how
[0:46:23] yrvengalied: its in JPNN
[0:46:24] WATERMELONFRESH: ???
[0:46:27] UnboundSouls: context?
[0:46:28] DD_The_Shmey: Jammies Fault Lines Jammies
[0:46:30] yrvengalied: and i commented on it as well
[0:46:33] canhan81: who is he?
[0:46:34] dreddreplicant: and what he means by "suffer"
[0:46:36] an_kush: !song
[0:46:36] itmeBOT: I'm sorry I'm unable to determine which track is currently playing
[0:46:46] UnboundSouls: oh its a money issue
[0:46:48] CarrotWhisky: I mean, I understand his point of view. Microsoft does it at a loss.
[0:46:51] KurisuTheNinja: Microsoft has way more money than Sony. So they can eat the cost of putting new games out at a loss. Sony doesn’t have nearly the capital so I doubt they could take losses like that.
[0:46:53] Layercake: ''gamers''
[0:46:53] cyberronic: wat
[0:46:54] DD_The_Shmey: Jammies Salt Mines Jammies
[0:46:56] NoorElBahrain: 🚴
[0:46:57] an_kush: what song is this chat?
[0:46:59] afreak10: rooSuffer live service
[0:47:01] SlipCrit: they als odotn have MS fuck you money
[0:47:01] NoorElBahrain: !song
[0:47:02] itmeBOT: It doesn't appear that I hold any information about this track, Sorry
[0:47:04] itz_just_camel: that makes sense because gamepass is prolly more used on pc than it is on xbox
[0:47:05] cyberronic: and hey all ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE ijpDOGSLIDE
[0:47:07] dreddreplicant: of course it is a money issues, sony is a corporation
[0:47:09] ultimaprinny: “Suffer” = low sales probably
[0:47:10] Mrshilka: Microsoft has more money cause gamepass is printing cash
[0:47:15] yrvengalied: basically we invested alot and want big return on them so we cannot offer it for cheap @itmeJP
[0:47:18] xAdrenal1ne: @an_kush Faultline - Prxsm
[0:47:25] WATERMELONFRESH: Sony can't eat the loss on day 1 release
[0:47:27] Mrshilka: they want money
[0:47:27] dreddreplicant: idk
[0:47:27] SchnellBier: we like money peepoHappy
[0:47:30] oaktree3: yup prob low sales
[0:47:33] darktall: means i wanna charge u 70 bucks for the game
[0:47:38] raptorscream: @Mrshilka MS has money because Azure > Office > Wiondows
[0:47:39] UnboundSouls: "we will make less money from people only buying ps+"
[0:47:40] an_kush: @xAdrenal1ne you the mvp
[0:47:43] freetownJoe: smaller games bite sized
[0:47:44] Thrishmal: They think the game pass method is ultimately losing money
[0:47:45] KurisuTheNinja: It means they don’t have fuck you money like Microsoft and can’t take the losses
[0:47:48] Xzaven: @darktall 80 mopre likely
[0:47:51] dreddreplicant: he likes that sweet 70 dollars price tag right
[0:47:53] Kaleith: gamers definitely wouldn't want to get those games day 1 included in their subscription COPIUM
[0:47:54] InternetPlumber: means they don't think they can sell enough subs for the MRC to cover the large $70 quarterly dumps
[0:47:54] OuroborosChemist: @Mrshilka yea and that less than 5% of microsofts revenue come from making game
[0:47:55] KelticNight: they see their big games like "blockbuster movies"
[0:47:57] bakavic: they are banking on gaas instead of sub based games service
[0:47:59] itz_just_camel: 70 bucks is a huge punch in the wallet
[0:48:01] cyberronic: "but muh $80 bucks!"
[0:48:08] EmperorMethos: @itmeJP basically saying if they put games day one, they won't have as much motivation to invest alot of money into those games
[0:48:10] Mrshilka: @raptorscream diferent dizisions the finacials shown gamepass is making more money then xbox hardware
[0:48:11] yrvengalied: but they can do that for new IPs for a trail run so that people can buy it or not
[0:48:23] freetownJoe: PS on PC
[0:48:23] dreddreplicant: is he okay
[0:48:28] castielsensei: lolwut
[0:48:32] Wchillinman: ruuWut
[0:48:33] Mauldidnothingwrong: I'm hoping Persona 3 FES will finally be playable on PS4 as well thesal28Salute
[0:48:33] raptorscream: @Mrshilka oh yeah, software will always make more money than hardware for consoles
[0:48:37] Collin7: were his eyes closed? how did he not see it
[0:48:38] KDRushby: if they cant afford to put first party on there how are they gonna get 3rd party releases big enough to compete with game pass?
[0:48:43] OuroborosChemist: 80$ isn't bad inflation adjusted i paid 110$ for games 15-20 years ago
[0:48:44] gigamesh00: cmon jim ryan. bloodborne pc will sell 100 million units Kappa
[0:48:47] ZcottD: hes saying a lot of nothing
[0:48:49] UnboundSouls: yup
[0:48:51] dynasstone: he seems out of the loop or just pure dumb
[0:48:53] m3rcer: yep
[0:48:54] Darkaros: YAPPP
[0:48:54] KelticNight: "we never saw it coming" says the people asking for GoW on PC the second it came out LUL
[0:48:55] yrvengalied: YEPPP
[0:48:55] skeoch: Exec speak for we like our revenue streams as they are, do not f with it.
[0:48:57] UnboundSouls: professional shit talker
[0:48:58] itz_just_camel: that is a talent not many have
[0:49:02] Kultak: pure corporate
[0:49:03] an_kush: who's bing watching moonnknight tomorrow?
[0:49:03] EightBitDelight: Typical suit I guess
[0:49:03] oaktree3: i heard a giant shrug
[0:49:04] WATERMELONFRESH: Corpo speak
[0:49:05] KelticNight: talks a lot, says nothing
[0:49:05] TheChristopherG: Master degree in PR
[0:49:06] Layercake: Jim Ryan could be a great politician  HahaThink
[0:49:08] Mrshilka: @Darkaros Dark! ijpH
[0:49:25] CarrotWhisky: It is Bloomberg he is being interviewed by, so understandable.
[0:49:26] crispybc: basically he said until you stop buying games day 1 we won't add it the srvice
[0:49:28] ultimaprinny: That guy has no personality whatsoever
[0:49:39] dreddreplicant: ps plus sucks on ps4
[0:49:40] Darkaros: Mrshilka ijpH ijpLOVE
[0:49:42] Mrshilka: 20 bucks a month no new releases
[0:49:47] WDForty: top end is $120/year
[0:49:56] Mrshilka: still pay 70+ for a new title
[0:50:03] raptorscream: isnt gamepass 120$/year too?
[0:50:06] EightBitDelight: @Mrshilka ijpHI
[0:50:10] WDForty: it's going to depend on the game catalogue
[0:50:13] CarrotWhisky: @raptorscream I don't think Game Pass has yearly payment yet?
[0:50:14] bakavic: they just merged ps+ and ps now
[0:50:15] yrvengalied: they will do it cause of the exposure that sony brings
[0:50:18] Mrshilka: yeah but gamepass ultimate is pc and xbox and day 1 everything
[0:50:23] yrvengalied: but they will turn to Xbox in the end
[0:50:25] UnboundSouls: corret
[0:50:25] ItsBatsy: The thing is the biggest one is the same price as the same as now and plus with no changes
[0:50:27] Kirino20: @itmeJP as far as i know, xbox gamepass makes not that much profit its more or less "even" . but i dont find where i rad that and its mor then 1 month old
[0:50:27] freetownJoe: long term sustaining
[0:50:28] UnboundSouls: correct
[0:50:29] ChosenDark1: $60 for basic vs $120 for premium
[0:50:35] cyberronic: but I get more for less... on gamepass.. so its not a "terrific" value
[0:50:35] freedout: next it'll be: $99.99.
[0:50:36] Mrshilka: @EightBitDelight EBD! ijpH
[0:50:37] KurisuTheNinja: They don’t have the capital like Microsoft does
[0:50:43] WDForty: that $1 deal was amazing for MS
[0:50:52] CarrotWhisky: Short vs. long term analysis essentially.
[0:50:54] raptorscream: Gamepass also blew up because of all the Day 1 releases, outside of Exclusives too
[0:51:00] ItsBatsy: For people that alreadys ub to plus and now this service offers nothing new
[0:51:05] UnboundSouls: yea, just look at Epic store, Origin LUL
[0:51:07] EmperorMethos: @itmeJP Sony cannot take losses like MS can with their deeper pockets
[0:51:11] RybackStun: Right, because Xbox had Day 1 from Day 1. If Sony thinks they can't do that then their service is DoA
[0:51:20] Kaleith: @raptorscream you can get up to 3 years at 60ish USD/year with the upgrade trick
[0:51:20] Drewskii10: Their market is only consoles too
[0:51:20] TonnyWalker: Weeeell to be fair it took a bit time for game pass  to  have a veeeery  good  catalog
[0:51:24] Mrshilka: the no day 1 is the big thing here
[0:51:25] OuroborosChemist: first to market for any subscription service is huge thing
[0:51:28] WDForty: the Day 1 thing for Gamepass came after Gamepass showed itself as something viable in the long run
[0:51:34] Mrshilka: youpay 20 a month and no day 1
[0:51:43] cyberronic: ah the retro bait
[0:51:44] Tehnshun: stream ps3 games Pog
[0:51:47] oaktree3: for some1 like me who is at avg a saturday gamer monthly sub is not efficient  for me but the option is great
[0:51:49] freedout: gamepass is an amazingly good deal.
[0:51:55] xence: something i havent heard anyone really comment on is with PS+ after adding a game to your library you keep it even after canceling PS+. if this stays the same with the higher tiers that would be huge over gamepass no?
[0:51:58] EthicaTank: not yet
[0:51:59] Wubsian: I just want it for the PS1/PS2 games
[0:52:00] WDForty: there's no game list yet
[0:52:00] SlipCrit: not till june
[0:52:03] Darbee: I want the list.
[0:52:04] yrvengalied: the reason for this whole " New subscription " is to push PS Now @itmeJP as PS plus users were 95% of the money being brought to sony and Now is not growing at all
[0:52:06] DrTazerFace: Meh I have no need for gamepass. Not enough time and no games I absolutely have to play
[0:52:07] ItsBatsy: @itmeJP this is ltierally just psn and ps+ combined thats it
[0:52:08] CharlieMango85: i dont think xbox measures gamepass success solely on being profitable. It drives players to xbox, makes them buy more games, etc
[0:52:08] UnboundSouls: its probably not solidified yet
[0:52:15] WDForty: i top end also has some cloud gaming thing i think?
[0:52:26] CarrotWhisky: They did mentioned Returnal, Mortal Kombat, e.t.c. on the line up I think.
[0:52:27] WATERMELONFRESH: Sony also has to put cloud saves and backwards compatibility locked behind a paywall where as MS doesn't
[0:52:31] ultimaprinny: It’s not really gonna change. People will still get regular PS+ for online play. The other tiers is just for people who want everything it has to offer
[0:52:33] ZcottD: ya some titles can only be streamed
[0:52:36] itz_just_camel: I mean being able to go back and play ps2 games is gonna be great but its not as sustainable as GP
[0:52:37] Randomdude08: So what about PSNow? How will this service effect that?
[0:52:38] Kaleith: most of the streamable stuff will be the same that already is on PS NOW
[0:52:39] KDRushby: give me spartan total warrior and other ps2 titles and  ill pay them whatever they want
[0:52:41] Tehnshun: top end has ps3 games streamed
[0:52:41] Siggenlh: lots of non-sony IP to figure out i think.
[0:52:41] BlueSapphyre: depending on the ps2 library, i could see myself convinced to get it.
[0:52:44] German_LoCaD: But sony offer games might not expire bun on gamepass games expire frequently.
[0:52:47] SpaceDive: I just want a ps5 at msrp
[0:53:00] DrTazerFace: I Have a ps5 and will buy premium though
[0:53:00] gulox2: They did say all major publishers are on board for the offerings, I believe.
[0:53:02] cosmicblip: playing the retro games on ps now streaming is not going to be good hope they do a big upgrade to that
[0:53:04] itz_just_camel: @Randomdude08 it doesnt if you have the base level nothing changes
[0:53:04] bakavic: the price to get what we already are getting isnt changing
[0:53:05] CarrotWhisky: PS+ is still very huge; if even a small percentage of it buys the highier tiers, it could be a profit decision for Sony.
[0:53:13] Siggenlh: hope they bring back the older stuff that got removed from the PSstore
[0:53:24] ItsBatsy: Its literally just ps now added to ps+ there is nothing new here. Its even the same price at the top end
[0:53:29] WDForty: this doesn't change PS+, but gives it extra tiers above it
[0:53:30] freedout: you can even vpn membership for much cheaper by signing up via another countries location.
[0:53:36] freetownJoe: MmmHmm
[0:53:39] Narnun: that's because they locked online under PS+
[0:53:40] Kaleith: nibellion mentioned it will include Death Stranding, God Of War 1, Marvel's Spider-Man (+ Miles Morales), Mortal Kombat 11, Returnal
[0:53:42] itz_just_camel: isnt that unrealistic competition?
[0:53:46] cyberronic: we already there KEKW
[0:53:49] DrTazerFace: PS3 is the only console they haven’t added to the list yet
[0:53:53] InternetPlumber: requiring PS+ for multiplayer is waht drove that number
[0:53:56] Narnun: if Online wasn't locked under a subscription no one would ever buy PS+
[0:54:07] GregoryGlen: ijpNODDERS agreed
[0:54:08] raptorscream: ^
[0:54:10] Richie31213: @xence thats because that isnt true
[0:54:12] KelticNight: it's Jim Ryan, he's been wrong before LUL
[0:54:21] oaktree3: i mean CEOs are 9ften wrong
[0:54:23] cosmicblip: ps now is using old technology then what xbox and amazon are using its not good
[0:54:23] Wubsian: @SarcasticFiend it's PS1/PS2/PS3 games but PS3 games are cloud streaming only
[0:54:28] afreak10: modCheck Successful live service ?
[0:54:32] German_LoCaD: true too
[0:54:34] fearthedawn: i think he means market percentages, like 90%+ of music is streaming or something stupid like that and he doesn't expect that for gaming any time soon
[0:54:37] Narnun: for every live service working there's 100 failed ones
[0:54:42] SchnellBier: live service games like babylons fall or marvels avengers KEKW
[0:54:47] Kymix: Thatis why sony invested so much into Bungie
[0:54:48] WDForty: you have to remember MS locked away online behind Paid Gold first for years before PS started charging
[0:54:48] 00oniking00: @afreak10 never see one
[0:54:50] freedout: thanks to boomers.
[0:54:51] freetownJoe: LUL
[0:54:55] ultimaprinny: It means gamers are a fickle bunch. They change their minds frequently about games lol
[0:54:58] Nemm__: I dunno, it doesn't feel like overall growth so much as bloat
[0:54:59] Narnun: I guess its worth launching fail live service games until you get one going
[0:55:00] gulox2: I bet the PSP games are gonna be a bigger draw than people think.
[0:55:01] CarrotWhisky: But a successful live service can easily make the 100 failed ones worth it.
[0:55:05] freedout: gen X
[0:55:16] DrTazerFace: @wubsian the article I read said ps1 and 2 games will be available
[0:55:23] Wubsian: this guy goes more indetail about the new service https://twitter.com/zhugeex/status/1508788345547206663?s=21&t=wc_4VOFHjAl2-Mga60eqdA
[0:55:33] UnboundSouls: isnt Overwatch turning into a live service?
[0:55:55] CarrotWhisky: Live service games is something Sony has been lacking. Will be interesting to see what Bungie and Haven will provide.
[0:55:56] Narnun: wasn't overwatch already a live service game?
[0:56:04] oaktree3: i thought overwTch already was
[0:56:05] UnboundSouls: they didnt give us any real updates on the game
[0:56:07] yrvengalied: @Wubsian yup
[0:56:09] KelticNight: it's funny cos Ryan once said no one wanted backwards compatibility, now it's a sub tier LUL
[0:56:11] Wubsian: Babylons Fall is the best live service game out ijpKEK
[0:56:21] m3rcer: so many lootboxes
[0:56:21] CarrotWhisky: Overwatch kinda was live service the same way Team Fortress 2 was if we talk about loot boxes and such.
[0:56:22] Mrshilka: ijpWHALE
[0:56:24] Paloran: Overwatch was fun in it's beta. That was the last time I had fun with it. Feels miserable to play now.
[0:56:54] yrvengalied: they just didnt wanna invest into remaking their catalog of games
[0:56:55] Mrshilka: it lost is whimsy
[0:56:58] ReginaldXIV: OW is fun, just turn off voice chat
[0:56:58] InternetPlumber: toxic ass blizard fans
[0:57:02] Baalversi666: HI @itmeJP & chat
[0:57:02] cosmicblip: ps now only just added 1080p last april and its still not as good as xbox x cloud
[0:57:04] Mrshilka: became serious business
[0:57:06] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[0:57:09] TonnyWalker: Overwatch is one of those  games that are only fun with a squad of friends
[0:57:09] UnboundSouls: i played the hell out of overwatch until Bridgette came out
[0:57:20] oaktree3: same
[0:57:24] Narnun: what about baby games like Tunic and Kirby JP? Not your jam?
[0:57:29] Nemm__: I really hope OW2 is great. But I will have fun with it either way
[0:57:33] Narnun: there's a bunch of interesting indies
[0:57:36] ReginaldXIV: Tunic is a difficult game lol
[0:57:37] Mrshilka: @Narnun why call them baby games?
[0:57:47] Mrshilka: Tunic is fucking fox darksouls
[0:57:50] Riluske: heard Tunic was great
[0:57:50] DrTazerFace: Now you have time for PoE
[0:57:51] UnboundSouls: for me its when even winning makes you salty
[0:57:53] FaceMcShooty: yeah irrc
[0:57:55] WDForty: the whole free HK thing put a LOT of ppl off overwatch
[0:57:58] SlipCrit: their on like season 333 now
[0:57:59] German_LoCaD: I still argue Genshin is a lifeservice big Endwalker sized update every 2 months, every 2 weeks smaller event updades, areas new characters.
[0:58:04] Narnun: @Mrshilka cause of the asthetic, it's a in joke for me
[0:58:04] SlipCrit: 33*
[0:58:12] Mrshilka: NOPERS
[0:58:13] Narnun: Tunic is hard though you are right
[0:58:13] swordofrahl: overwatch just never captured what TF2 was for me... too serious and enough fun
[0:58:13] JeedanJune: i quit on the 2nd day of Overwatch release PepeLaugh
[0:58:14] Altair900: Tunic is quite difficult and Kirby is just fun. Games like those shouldnt be called baby games just cause of art style
[0:58:15] FaceMcShooty: you streamed a fuckton in s1
[0:58:16] AinzN: I stopped OW when OWL became a thing
[0:58:18] Narnun: although I have like 1 hour in tunic
[0:58:20] ReginaldXIV: Tunic is like mini Elden Ring
[0:58:22] Narnun: I haven't played much
[0:58:23] Mrshilka: @JeedanJune MmmHmm
[0:58:27] ItsBatsy: @German_LoCaD That is just what gacha games typically do
[0:58:29] JeedanJune: MmmHmm @Mrshilka
[0:58:53] Rdei: its fun before people found out the meta
[0:58:58] Baalversi666: i got a mail about diablo immortal   today
[0:58:58] freetownJoe: KEKW
[0:58:59] johnpaul79: Hi 👋 all
[0:59:00] SlipCrit: the arcade mosdes were most fdun to me
[0:59:03] Cronopolis: I miss pre rework mercy ult so bad
[0:59:03] Mrshilka: OWL killed many things
[0:59:05] UnboundSouls: oh now i remember, i deleted my account when they fired 1200 people overnight, and then Apex came out a few months later
[0:59:09] shibbsyy: They forced the esports aspect and it just ruined it.
[0:59:11] Luciodamus: the toxic community killed it for me
[0:59:12] johnpaul79: !commands
[0:59:13] itmeBOT: For a list of commands (and what they do) visit https://itmebot.com/commands/
[0:59:17] WATERMELONFRESH: It invited try hards Kappa
[0:59:19] Bananaramer02: I miss OW with PJ
[0:59:23] gigamesh00: because it catered towards esports ?
[0:59:24] xence: @xence oh you're right!! i'm not sure why i thought this was the case!
[0:59:25] ReginaldXIV: When OWL launched, they stopped doing cool stuff in-game
[0:59:26] AinzN: I wasted so much money on the OWL emotes
[0:59:29] eke____: trying to force a game into an esports makes for a boring esports it should come naturally
[0:59:33] m3rcer: bunker meta was not fun to play
[0:59:38] freetownJoe: It brought an attitude ?
[0:59:38] espi: calling people "tryhards" in a competitive game
[0:59:43] shibbsyy: JP the Junkrat main.
[0:59:44] Mrshilka: the meta feed a certaint ype of people
[0:59:51] EightBitDelight: @AinzN ijpHI
[0:59:56] AinzN: EightBitDelight ijpHI
[0:59:58] UnboundSouls: yea the problem with overwatch is that your ability to play certain characters didnt transfer to others
[1:00:00] TonnyWalker: It invited the why  are you not playing this character crowd
[1:00:07] itmeBOT: Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[1:00:08] Shapelessdnb: Gamers destroyed it
[1:00:11] Kultak: yeah, removed the fun
[1:00:13] andigawa: i kinda missed one ranked season and noticed i didnt care
[1:00:15] Paloran: Yuuuuup when the meta gets established it's very anti-fun usually.
[1:00:17] FaceMcShooty: i loved ur junkrad games. u mastered that hero
[1:00:21] ReginaldXIV: At least Genji sucks now
[1:00:23] freedout: biobreak
[1:00:23] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP I would say it made a certain mentality spawn which gave way to toxicity in a game that didn't need it
[1:00:23] SlipCrit: they didnt understand the godrat Sadge
[1:00:25] ReginaldXIV: That's all that matters
[1:00:27] Shapelessdnb: it's the toxic side of competitive gaming
[1:00:29] SchnellBier: meta slaves destroy a lot of fun in games
[1:00:29] Narnun: but league has a meta as well
[1:00:31] Narnun: and all that
[1:00:32] Shrimp_Parm: no ads ijpSAD
[1:00:34] ok_juju: competitive overwatch was hard to look at as a spectator too busy
[1:00:38] KelticNight: LUL
[1:00:43] Mrshilka: Anno Pog
[1:00:43] Shoaron: Pog
[1:00:44] k0jak: anno pog
[1:00:44] WDForty: OWL turned OW from a fun game that's a decent e-sport to something that was hyper e-sports focused and anything that happened in the OWL became truth in casual games and if you weren't doing exactly that you were playing the game wrong and bad

[2:13:14] Dark_lite7: going in at a high price point. Should start lower and gain a base.
[2:13:15] StarPogPlatinum: Paid demos or trials, yikes

[2:13:29] ch0ncy: I wonder if you can still buy a card for cheaper on eBay for this service like you can now?
[2:13:30] German_LoCaD: PS games you keep forever though gamepass games leave the service monthly.
[2:13:46] Archangel3003: The premium stuff should just be combined with the extra bundle for the same price or maybe bumped up slightly to £12. Otherwise I don't see many people going for the premium option

[2:15:48] German_LoCaD: PS games you keep forever though gamepass games leave the service monthly.
[2:15:52] The_Faceless_Void: @theyreredhott gamepass told us day 1 of the games they would offer and yet crickets from sony

[2:16:02] quaxim: rise up gamers
[2:16:03] serein: @theyreredhott I mean, they don't have first party games on day 1, with game pass, 120 per year I get my value if I play 2 $60 games I otherwise would have bought
[2:16:05] theyreredhott: @The_Faceless_Void fam its been 5 hours, relax LMFAO
[2:16:08] Brunetteclutz: I don't pay for gamepass lol. I can't afford any of it.

[2:16:39] FrozanFlames: end result still no competition for game passs.. Sadge
[2:16:40] thanh_n2004: it's hard to compete with gamepass in general i feel. even if sony put their 1st party games for free, it still wouldn't compete
[2:16:40] Truder2k: @Truder2k but is there actual cash to be had ?
[2:16:46] DannyDeVitosHairline: sony fans have been crying for ps1 ps2 ps3 backwards compatibilty, they said it wasnt possible/ ignored fans. Now they have it but charge for it
[2:16:56] jmm548: damn i own all of those
[2:17:07] Senverti: pretty much nothing if youre already a playstation loyal
[2:17:09] OuroborosChemist: @DannyDeVitosHairline gotta monetize things ppl "want"

[2:18:57] serein: @theyreredhott It's not like I need 100% of value right out of the gate for game pass, it's the whole year. I just don't see me being interested in the games on PS+ catalog that aren't on PC already

[2:38:21] Viriskali15: was that a streamer wide change or specific to you? @itmejp
[2:38:23] Panda_c260: @aurice_heartly that requires you have your ps4 setup cause they don't usually offer the ps4 versions on ps5 storefront
[2:38:23] Supwizy: I refuse to buy the new horizon because its 70
[2:38:24] JimB0b0: maybe buy a second copy to give away to add to your anaylsis?
[2:38:27] Truder2k: @p_michaud wasn't that the first one, and not the new one ?

[2:49:43] SZebra: This looks far too much like hard work.
[2:49:45] Mrshilka: its a trailer for a spefiic use chat
[2:49:49] radiologue: it's a trailer for people that don't need to haul anything that weighs anything
[2:49:51] ThaSandus: I mean i guess thats kinda neat for a small trailer tbh
[2:49:52] OuroborosChemist: @The_Faceless_Void 2,8x5m trailer only weights 250kgs so this is not that light
[2:49:57] TheObviousLine: just get a truck already
[2:49:59] The_Faceless_Void: @KimTheMisfit no doubt just those two things together seem odd and im a little high KEKW

[2:52:06] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP would you ever install a elevator chair from your gaming room to the upstairs?
[2:52:12] b0ksah: properly not good for gravel or building mats  but if you don't need that then sure
[2:52:17] EdGLives: I mean you can just build a trailer that size with wood and some scrap metal and an axel off an old car and itll probably be around the same weight
[2:52:24] freedout: saves having the truck and car and just use the trailer to haul stuff to dump etc
