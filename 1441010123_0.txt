[0:12:28] AeraStormm: @aaahahahahahahahahahahaha cuz they suck tian never lost it
[0:12:31] Seanatonin_: unless JKL just ints

[0:19:50] snoopzilla_: Doinb rumble predetor ? like in worlds ?
[0:20:06] pi_______________________: @hunsmerc world champs lose to randoms? viet jgler?
[0:20:34] pokojnaslavica: go DOINB
[0:20:45] irlgigachad: bengi had a 3 year run, truly great players usually have 8-10 years. While it was probably one of the best short runs, he had a very stacked squad around him. Then floundered getting replaced by blank, going to VG and not having a good showing in LPL
[0:20:47] ElliotLake: Hello everyone. I hope all of you are having a wonderful evening/day :)
[0:20:56] goodboy_yanfei: actually WBG is the finallist of 2020 isnt it

[0:21:46] splintso: do we not remember 2019?? world champions lost to TL in MSI semi final?? calssic worlds hangover
[0:21:58] pi_______________________: WBG are hard randoms with washed top laner and bottom tier mid laner
[0:22:08] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ they arent randoms. they are literally sunin who made the world final the year before? and SOFM is a veteran
[0:22:38] irlgigachad: @pi_______________________ the most diceroll team out there, each taking turns being bad
[0:22:54] dynysos: peepoHey Hey chat
[0:23:05] sanestplayer: LNG in 4 or TES in 5 Kappa
[0:23:39] goodboy_yanfei: I believe TES 3-2
[0:23:39] hunsmerc: the fact is that any of the top 7 teams could probably beat each other on their day
[0:24:08] sanestplayer: this match is 50/50
[0:24:08] alcubierre01: !tes
[0:24:10] theeelegendhimself: LNG makes this quick pls
[0:24:42] pi_______________________: why cant lpl teams have the class of LCK? whens the last time a lpl team went undefeated?
[0:24:46] hunsmerc: @theeelegendhimself they wont, they always have at least 1 bad game in them
[0:24:49] splintso: nah its cold n rainy im in for 5 games
[0:24:52] yuio3456: playoffs are delayed 1 week after today's games?
[0:24:54] alcubierre01: 100/0

[0:25:25] Moobot: THE LPL NOW HAS AN OFFICIAL DISCORD SERVER! Join here: https://discord.com/invite/tZBguQtcAc
[0:25:27] splintso: @yuio3456 i think its tomorrow?
[0:25:32] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ is this a joke question? T1 are by far the best team in their league. everyone else is dreadful. The LPL has about 4 teams on T1 level
[0:26:03] irlgigachad: @pi_______________________ not undefeated, but in both 2018 splits 2018 ig 18-1 each split. lost MSI since it was duke in playoffs not theshy
[0:26:12] pokojnaslavica: why delayed covid?
[0:26:16] yogui_nodogma: @pi_______________________ indeed
[0:26:36] theeelegendhimself: Jackeylove play syndra for me Kappa Kappa Kappa
[0:26:47] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ its a stupid question. The LPl is much more competitive with more teams.
[0:26:53] splintso: i just dont see a world where V5 can legit match T1
[0:26:56] pi_______________________: @hunsmerc you must be trolling. chovy is the best mid ( just watch him cs!) and canyon best jg in the world
[0:26:57] xddman1234567: hello LPL lovers ratirlAlfred
[0:27:35] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ you named two players who are carrying their teams, canyon has burden. they would both get stomped by T1
[0:27:37] irlgigachad: and still my favorite feat of 2018 ig: winning a professional game with the owner as adc, it was AA cancel galore with many other visible mistakes
[0:27:39] gasparsq1: h
[0:27:46] cosmoslr: who gonna win?
[0:28:13] pi_______________________: @hunsmerc yes because t1 has class unlike the lpl coinflippers
[0:28:14] fancti: @cosmoslr TSM
[0:28:36] splintso: @aaahahahahahahahahahahaha that was hilarious
[0:28:38] cosmoslr: tes?
[0:28:57] fazed343: @pi_______________________ LCK frog COPIUM is always a wine best served cold KEKW
[0:29:02] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ Has class? like losing games in best of 3's against bottom teams in LCK?
[0:29:19] fancti: where would TSM rank in lpl ?
[0:29:20] tranquilfraise: TSM WILL WIN WORLDS
[0:29:40] pi_______________________: @hunsmerc 18-0
[0:30:10] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ we're comparing LCK to LPL. your 18-0 has no relevance to the LPL. God your  IQ is low
[0:30:12] doctor_strange_8: Which team will choose the side for the first game?
[0:30:38] pi_______________________: @hunsmerc still waiting for u to cite an LPL team EVER that has gone undefeated
[0:30:43] alphakush1: t1 19-0 now soon to be 20-0
[0:30:50] yDerickADC: sorry guys but im the biggest hater of TSM
[0:30:57] fancti: bottom 3 lck teams so strong even best team  t1 struggles against them monkaW
[0:31:01] nbooob: @pi_______________________ I think hes baiting you, dont get too invested
[0:31:16] Hechyyy: COPIUM
[0:31:29] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ cant bait when he can't form a single argument
[0:31:29] yDerickADC: no, im the biggest hater of LCS and all NA fanss
[0:31:51] pi_______________________: @hunsmerc the argument is 18-0 and u cant refute
[0:32:06] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ LPL teams dont play in a one team league.
[0:32:16] choukurron: start when?
[0:32:30] pi_______________________: @hunsmerc they play in a coinflip league
[0:32:43] Hechyyy: comparing LCK 18-0 to LPL 17-0 is legit so dumb
[0:32:43] beyond_the_aeons: Wait is that iwandy Pog
[0:32:44] fancti: lpl is farmers league Sadge
[0:32:51] tsefakrikri: @choukurron bruh
[0:32:59] hunsmerc: you've only been watching this league since january. sit down kid
[0:33:11] Gogumarc: there is a freakin countdown
[0:33:16] imsoo87: Nu ga jungbae ya???
[0:33:16] splintso: if T1 dont win LCK and MSI 18-0 means less than nothing
[0:33:35] ElliotLake: catJAM
[0:33:47] ghostbladeeee: who is the favorite guys?
[0:33:50] hunsmerc: @splintso agreed
[0:33:56] xg32: will tian remember how to play the game today
[0:34:13] pi_______________________: t1 18-0 is a class never been seen in LPL , its just the truth and a hard pill to swallow for LPL fans
[0:34:21] choukurron: @gogumarc sry i am blind
[0:34:26] hunsmerc: @xg32 only if he gets his preferred champs
[0:34:27] xg32: i like TES but i gotta give it to LNG man, tarzan into tian is just....
[0:34:31] AgentCuckyMGZ: #LNGWIN

[0:34:58] kbks123: #TESM WIN
[0:35:08] Hechyyy: stomping a bad league is now harder than winning a competitive one got it KEKW i guess 17-1 immortals is the best team ever KEKW
[0:35:18] bl3xfull: @pi_______________________ nah but lpl won worlds in past 4 years 3 times and korea only 1 time
[0:35:30] hunsmerc: @Hechyyy he has no sense of logic. lmao
[0:35:43] edehunn: west taiwan
[0:35:52] pi_______________________: LPL won using korean players
[0:36:07] turhtk236: LNG BELIEVERS GIGACHAD

[0:36:22] imsoo87: Lol=korean

[0:36:42] splintso: no doubt T1 18-0 is a wonderful feat all props to them but that means NOTHING now
[0:36:47] pi_______________________: oof kids in here calling league a sport
[0:36:52] pokojnaslavica: with DOINB WE BELIEVE
[0:36:55] jiniyxxn: is NL subbing in for Light?
[0:37:23] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ pretty clear you haven't watched any sports.
[0:37:25] splintso: @Hechyyy dude if only... 50k T1 trolls on LCK stream everytime they play
[0:37:25] xg32: i dont think any team in the lpl is favorite in a bo5 against t1 atm
[0:37:30] xddman1234567: hello LPL lovers ratirlAlfred
[0:37:40] citruslove0809: @pi_______________________ Esports at the 2022 Asian Games :D
[0:37:42] pi_______________________: LPL games are literally just checking which of the koreans they bought are playing better on the day
[0:37:51] inl777: midking doinb
[0:37:56] xg32: at least i wouldnt bet money on it
[0:38:14] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ so you have an agenda against chinese players? not the LPL
[0:38:18] dynysos: SourPls
[0:38:19] larricane: #LNGWIN
[0:38:19] Hechyyy: @pi_______________________ why cant teams with 5 koreans beat teams with 2 koreans then? mind explaining why korea doesnt win int. events?
[0:38:31] yongtph: tes to win?
[0:38:54] pi_______________________: @Hechyyy they won the most by far lmfao ur actually new
[0:39:01] xddman1234567: i hope we get 5 games pepeD
[0:39:01] jiniyxxn: @pi_______________________ LPL has better Koreans that's the explanation
[0:39:04] citruslove0809: @pi_______________________ You have such an in-depth understanding of Pro league wow amazing POG holy
[0:39:09] larricane: @pi_______________________ LPL have better korean players
[0:39:19] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ -subscribed since jan 2022 "new"
[0:39:37] Hechyyy: korea has won 1 international event since 2018. who cares nowadays if they wont early seasons if they cant compete now
[0:39:37] kakdugi3: right?
[0:39:38] pi_______________________: i mean they are obviously gonna buy the best koreans arent they? thats how this works
[0:39:40] xg32: the kr talent drain was real, didnt pay players well + military service
[0:39:49] taysobrazzy: TES
[0:39:49] Moobot: Stay up to date on all the important LPL news on our Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/lplenglish
[0:40:03] fazed343: The LCK COPIUM is so real in this chat KEKW Keep whining
[0:40:30] Hechyyy: HAHAHA yeah. LCK COPIUM is fuckin great
[0:40:31] NIP_R00KIE: edg?????
[0:40:33] jiniyxxn: @xg32 true, lucky Doinb finding a wife and citizenship in China
[0:40:37] pi_______________________: LPL directly purchased nuguri after he won a world championship even
[0:40:47] sayyestowidehard: cringe
[0:40:47] kbks123: west taiwan league
[0:40:56] captainkrajick: Doinb LCK reject KEKW win worlds is now LCK player???
[0:41:02] citruslove0809: @pi_______________________ I suppose every team in every region just tries to buy the best players......
[0:41:03] splintso: T1 have mostly synergy from last year meny teams have a lot of improvement to go
[0:41:07] o_IDistortion_o: I thought lpl was delayed or did I misread?
[0:41:12] ghostbladeeee: what's your score prediction guys?
[0:41:18] valorant_is_sleeper: lpl = nothing but korean carries deal with it. truth hurts
[0:41:31] hunsmerc: every year its a one man korean team dominating LCK
[0:41:34] captainkrajick: @o_idistortion_o after the next 2 series 1 week break before double elim
[0:41:38] irlgigachad: another thing LCK fans dont grasp is iirc the LCK didnt want/gave up on doinb/theshy and were made in LPL. No LCK coach would have let theshy develop his style which changed the game post 2018. dopa wrote an article about how IG 2018 forever changed pro league
[0:41:56] banjing15: T1 > LPL
[0:42:01] hunsmerc: one team i mean not one man
[0:42:03] jiniyxxn: but who tf cares about nationality, it's irrelevant when rng won msi with 5 chinese
[0:42:06] narvuntien: Chinese ADCs are still great. I am not sure why Chinese solo laners tend to struggle
[0:42:07] o_IDistortion_o: okay thanks
[0:42:19] captainkrajick: LCK fans only claim Korean players if they win anything in LPL. Where are the Gori fans? modCheck
[0:42:29] mahdmaxx: true doinb never has trust from korea china did everything and made him a pro player. Anyway if lpl was just about good korean why rng again high ranking with no korean
[0:42:36] ToTFlame: Jebaited
[0:42:39] valorant_is_sleeper: EDG was forever stuck in elo hell every season until last year. Viper literally makes them Worlds Champion.
[0:42:40] tranquilfraise: TSM will win worlds enough said
[0:42:58] Hechyyy: im losing too many braincells reading these LCK dogwater takes KEKW see ya chat
[0:42:58] citruslove0809: @captainkrajick There are probably few Gori fans cuz Gori disliked Faker
[0:43:03] pi_______________________: yup viper was an expensive purchase for sure
[0:43:05] NIP_R00KIE: @tranquilfraise true
[0:43:09] splintso: @captainkrajick true but Ucal kinda carried worst team was like top 5 mid
[0:43:13] o_IDistortion_o: tsm has to make playoffs to make worlds
[0:43:16] captainkrajick: @valorant_is_sleeper it's clearly Flandre diff since he only joined last year EZ
[0:43:19] xddman1234567: veiNODDERS
[0:43:32] ld3s05: BrokeBack BrokeBack

[0:43:51] sooperboof: marin in lpl LUL
[0:43:59] o_IDistortion_o: cashmeowTruffle
[0:44:00] banjing15: T1 > LPL
[0:44:05] mahdmaxx: @4evolutionpog real. Last time i see someone say you should put a korean instead of ucal lol
[0:44:10] hunsmerc: @captainkrajick They mention all the good korean players, which ironically most move to china because the LPL is more competitive, better pay. they dont mention the bad ones, eliim, burdol, effort etc
[0:44:11] captainkrajick: @valorant_is_sleeper World Champ and first China solo lane player to win Worlds though:)
[0:44:11] dynysos: pepeD
[0:44:19] Kell_Z: pepeJAM
[0:44:30] pi_______________________: if LPL players were good we woulda seen one imported to LCK by now
[0:44:46] valorant_is_sleeper: we all saw yesterday. literally Viper TheShy Scout vs 7 chinese
[0:44:49] SweenaHA: anyone ask the people in charge who wins today? :^)
[0:44:51] captainkrajick: if LCK wasn't racist they'd have LPL players by now
[0:45:11] irlgigachad: @pi_______________________ so im somewhat confused though, are you anti free market systems, believe it should be a measure of nations, let the players be at the mercy of various league-org standards. Imports have been a huge net benefit for league esports as a whole
[0:45:14] hunsmerc: @pi_______________________ why would a good chinese player go to LCK when all the good korean players are leaving the LCK?
[0:45:21] captainkrajick: @valorant_is_sleeper Viper ran the next game down oh but he's Korean :)
[0:45:25] mahdmaxx: Anyway t1 guy nothing can refute they did 18 0 but nothing to be proud when you don't play a single bo against gen g full team wait the final befere celebration
[0:45:30] puchicorn: Why would people go to lck when they pay less and they have to leave the own country?
[0:45:36] xg32: lck pays way less
[0:45:39] enthusiasticlied: @captainkrajick got gapped by theshy yesterday tho
[0:45:42] vv_fudge_vv: lck doesn't need to import. they have an ocean of players and pay the least out of all major regions
[0:45:42] xddman1234567: why is chat so madge today
[0:45:52] valorant_is_sleeper: @captainkrajick do u really think edg could win without viper and scout then u are delusional
[0:45:57] splintso: @captainkrajick dude u dont want to go there china is literally the most racist country throughout history
[0:46:01] OGDa1m: 3-1 or 3-0 LNG
[0:46:06] captainkrajick: @enthusiasticlied Amen TheShy LPL talent GIGACHAD
[0:46:16] xg32: they could import if they wanted to, lck basically has 2 teams
[0:46:19] pi_______________________: @puchicorn not even worth wondering, they havent even gotten a single offer from lck teams
[0:46:20] h011ywood: why does lck pay the least, are they too poor?
[0:46:42] vv_fudge_vv: no. that's just what they choose to do
[0:46:45] citruslove0809: @h011ywood china too rich
[0:46:46] xg32: or 3? i guess if dk gets a toplaner
[0:46:47] lonelykid322: ahah, what s up whit this music? so cool
[0:46:51] puchicorn: 3-0 with iwandy, 0-3 with LMAO
[0:46:53] jiniyxxn: i don't care about lck vs lpl but what I do know is that the top LPL players mostly consists of Koreans like Rookie, TheShy, Scout, Viper and Doinb
[0:46:55] thatsdanny4u: LNG is favored
[0:46:59] captainkrajick: @splintso ah sorry fam I've been there a few times and it was really fun and amazing experience as a brown guy
[0:47:02] A_Cute_Snek: @h011ywood not as much moeny as NA/CN, plus they dont have to pay money to attract talent
[0:47:07] SweenaHA: idk why people are even talking about these washed up regions when CBLOL > all
[0:47:30] xg32: it's not that they are poor, as one pro who retire put it, their other jobs pay like shit so players accept less, NA, CN has other shit to do so they more
[0:47:31] jiniyxxn: NL would destroy LPL for sure
[0:47:33] A_Cute_Snek: @4evolutionpog wtf? lmao, all I ever see is LPL fans bashing Korea unprompted
[0:47:40] captainkrajick: LCK fans chatting hoping LPL doesn't beat them again in international events

[0:54:04] irlgigachad: a thing lck import haters never mention are the player salaries, living conditions and overall player treatment. The peak was ofc griffin, contract madness, iirc had subpar living arrangements. But now tarzan/viper have amazing contracts, a dignified living situation and things likely have a better oversight.
