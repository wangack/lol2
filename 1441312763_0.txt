[0:24:14] genericnumber: We have to refrigerate our eggs in the US, because they wash off the protective coating in processing here.
[0:24:16] WDForty: Eggs in EU and Asia aren't washed during processing, so they keep the protective layer on the outside to prevent bacteria

[1:06:39] Wumbologistmd: @neurovoid I loved Battleborn. Gearbox's marketing team fucked that up so much trying to set it up as a Overwatch competitor. They also should've separated the PvE and pvp modes and made pvp free to play way earlier.

[2:14:47] dreddreplicant: LUL
[2:14:48] Senpai_Eeyore: if masks actually protected me from others and didn't protect others from me, then maybe I would wear one, but if no one else is, then I am not protecting anyone

[2:15:10] Sven_Stryker: they made us a Horse Feed Bag with headphones NODDERS
[2:15:15] BlazeRom: this looks so wrong
[2:15:17] Aurugorn: so what if you wanna talk to someone

[2:16:20] DesDroid1: True
[2:16:22] OuroborosChemist: well proper protection against emission and gasses looks pretty much like M95 mask usually so if this does the same its "fine"

[2:16:51] SuddleT: Someone's gonna turn this into a face bong
[2:16:51] Dukrah: !JPNN
[2:16:51] itmeBOT: ijpJPNN JPNN -- the JP News Network -- is a Wednesday + Friday gaming news show (NOW in a tasty Podcast flavor - https://jpnn.itme.jp or search for "JPNN" where you normally find podcasts). Before written news coverage, JP checks out trailers in Trailer Time (cut as a separate VOD for DMCA concerns). ijpJPNN
[2:16:52] SZebra: $500-$1000 before you ask
[2:16:53] moist_heinous: you will probably get mugged wearing something like that
[2:16:57] eniGzor: Bane needs music catJAM
[2:16:57] freedout: we do need it
[2:16:58] zerohour_88: sound like a 10 year boy IRL when I talk so that will be a massive improvement
[2:16:58] Shoaron: are the filters cleanable or replaceable?
[2:16:59] SavageCheez: I'd buy one
[2:17:09] fredrixyo: those filters are gonna get dank fast in a smog city
[2:17:11] its__fil: @Shoaron, you probably just buy a new pair KEKW
[2:17:12] heavymetalhorns: Kinda reminds me of the Mass Effect helmets when the visors are up
[2:17:16] airy_0: I'd buy one if im going to China or India
[2:17:18] BlazeRom: why not find ways to make air cleaner in cities Hmm
[2:17:21] Seregrim: yea after 1st patch they reduce battery life like on portable vacuums
[2:17:22] vashaun: remember when dyson came up with the air blade hand dryer and people thought it was great but in reality it was an awful way to dry your hands?
[2:17:26] freedout: for traveling
[2:17:31] Aurugorn: can we get a hide helmet function irl?
[2:17:31] SchnellBier: but where's the screen to measure the combat power?
[2:17:33] dragonbotherer: dyson blatantly trying to make us all quarians. Currently in hayfever hell though, so not against it...
[2:17:33] AlexWrapYourStuff: Here it starts BROTHERS the WH40K helmet erliest air filter version lfs666 lfsHU
[2:17:35] GraveSalad: this would be great working in our metal shop back in the day
[2:17:35] Kyriac: $7000
[2:17:35] Waypointier: timestamp your interactions
[2:17:35] OuroborosChemist: it doesnt protect against gasses entering eyes so its less useful
[2:17:36] Leysfort: that could be like the division tech
[2:17:36] SuddleT: ...who wanted this??
[2:17:38] SgtStruthers: Can u hook it up to a camel pack for hydration?
[2:17:41] Malitor: lol, germs are good for you
[2:17:41] RuleofBooKz: well if u have a Dyson Air purifier they give that data
[2:17:45] ThaSandus: probably like a grand LUL
[2:17:46] Banana25: imagine wearing that outside
[2:17:47] CapitanLlama: WTFF
[2:17:53] Zwilorg: already seen the trailer for Stanley parable release date??
[2:17:56] P4rappa: Needs a AR-visor to complete the look.
[2:17:56] ryukenchi: germophobes are gonna get this
[2:17:56] EvilBuho: For airplane and travel is for sure great.
[2:17:58] freedout: pretty cool really
[2:17:58] L4ncster: There was a good thread on twitter earlier about how this would be really good at spraying the air you breath out over quite a distance.  Refered to it as a snot cannon
[2:18:00] greedwinz: They should’ve just made a helmet instead of…w/e this is
[2:18:04] toesondanosehb: it is just like an over the nose CPAP machine...
[2:18:06] kildjian: It seems weird to me, because not closing off the nose from outside air you still get some unfiltered air
[2:18:07] zerohour_88: I'll just be quoting Bane the entire time wearing this
[2:18:07] tinyBlipInHistory: cooohhhpssh
[2:18:08] PrinsesTNGC: but it doesnt count as a mask for a plane
[2:18:09] NoorElBahrain: Clap
[2:18:10] BlazeRom: "I dare not breathe your dirty peasant air. I have filtered air."
[2:18:16] toesondanosehb: CPAP with headphones
[2:18:18] Nemm__: I can imagine this being fine in VERY niche situations, but day-to-day? Nah
[2:18:24] freedout: yeah during crowds while traveling
[2:18:26] SabertoothEwok: Im pretty sure it not being air tight makes it like only partially helpful? Other air is still gunna get being breathed in unless its blowing enough to displace all the air
[2:18:29] Adept_Zeno: i would want a full helmet or an eye visor or something
[2:18:29] ryukenchi: how about outside?
[2:18:30] larkhill: now is that better or worse than razer's fancy mask
[2:18:30] GameOnlyNoTalk: i bet that will be a hit with poker players
[2:18:39] WeeMr_Goodcat: i'd wear this. underground. this my army. as i planned to blow up gothem
[2:18:43] freedout: planes air is actually filtered and amazing clean
[2:18:45] jlhgameart: JP there's long threads on twitter about how that is a super spreader device for germs from the person wearing it.
[2:18:47] ok_juju: wonder would skin tan marks be in issue ijpHMM
[2:18:48] SuddleT: Can't wait to see peer-reviewed studies on how much this thing doesn't actually matter
[2:18:49] BlazeRom: hazmat suit when
[2:18:49] DagooX: but can it dispense chips? Hmm
[2:18:56] Mc_Grumble: April 1st?
[2:18:59] GraveSalad: every convention should make these mandatory. I forgot how gross conventions are, or maybe covid just made me paranoid now
[2:19:01] Thomathan36: Does it filter smells? Wear at conventions
[2:19:04] Starlorn: Those that are not exposed to the natural environment tend to be asmatic .. so I guess this will take it to the next level
[2:19:09] RuleofBooKz: So far Dyson has refused point blank to talk pricing on the Zone.
[2:19:12] OuroborosChemist: airplane air, recycled through HEPA filters so its more pure than outside air in 99% of cities
[2:19:15] ThaSandus: The actual earcup part looks kinda sick actually tho
[2:19:18] SavageCheez: Then later, they could craft a shaded visor that act as sunglasses
[2:19:21] zerohour_88: chuck KKona
[2:19:26] AinzN: Dammit Chuck! NOPERS
[2:19:29] Kymix: his name is mike
[2:19:30] GameOnlyNoTalk: its from my cousin, he knows a guy
[2:19:31] NoorElBahrain: Chuck Norris knows all
[2:19:32] Asna: Chuck, Cous he F*ks
[2:19:33] ElSpartin: arent their filters on it?
[2:19:37] ZcottD: chuck only cares about roaches
[2:19:37] Lutcha81: surprise, chuck testa
[2:19:38] larkhill: billy bob did his research
[2:19:40] zerohour_88: this mask and then those glasses from Deus Ex
[2:19:43] CapitanLlama: i think is better to wear the Razer Zephyr than that
[2:19:46] SgtStruthers: Like anyone cares about other people Kappa
[2:19:46] freedout: use it in a room with white light and spray a reflector material to watch how it performs
[2:19:50] TickleTheCohh: Pretty much. If you've got covid. You are expelling that air super far with this device. Because it doesn't filter your exhalation.
[2:19:52] Ebra: excited for it
[2:19:58] GraveSalad: 2 days till "don't read the internet" day
[2:19:58] TheRhymenoceros: i feel like the mask needs to be taller/ cover slightly more of the face
[2:19:58] DagooX: world peace Kappa
[2:19:58] BlueSapphyre: morbius is the biggest april fools joke.
[2:19:59] ArthurNudge: what game is up for community day?

[2:20:00] freaker286: JPNN on friday going to be great
[2:20:01] SlipCrit: probably things we actually want but wont get
[2:20:01] Thebestbubbles: does it have a defense system to protect you from being slapped?
[2:20:01] AinzN: I'm betting a lot of NFT stuff
[2:20:03] RuleofBooKz: Looks like a product that gives it's clean air for the rich, for the comfortable, for those who likely have access to preferable environmental conditions already.
[2:20:04] aurice_heartly: i still remember the Zelda Anime April Fools youtube video
[2:20:05] Starlorn: I guess the next level of this Dyson device will be smellyvision
[2:20:06] Zandivya: Just need a full daft punk helmet
[2:20:08] Ebra: excited for the jokes and videos
[2:20:09] McTribble: NFT versions of the dyson mask?
[2:20:11] NoorElBahrain: will Blizz even do anything this year?
[2:20:11] BlazeRom: April 1st will be horrible
[2:20:12] lord_baggabutts: keeps chucks name out your mfing mouth
[2:20:15] Asna: Millions of NTF april first
[2:20:15] Smiffus: like headphones with air filters.. noone will believe that..
[2:20:18] WeeMr_Goodcat: Something wild could happen, like will smith slapping chris rock

[2:20:35] zerohour_88: I am so over April 1st, its very rarely fun
[2:20:37] aurice_heartly: FF14 did April Fools joke last year
[2:20:37] Nemm__: for this year
[2:20:39] BlazeRom: Blizz will advertise as a safe company to work at on April 1st
[2:20:42] Senpai_Eeyore: they will fire Bobby Kotick on April 1st only to rehire him on the 2nd
[2:20:44] GraveSalad: reality is hard to beat nowadays. NFTs were peak april fools but people buy them like crazy

[2:21:33] ihatevnecks: companies are going to announce real NFTs on april 1st, and then avoid the blowback because everyone will just assume april fools
[2:21:33] WeeMr_Goodcat: o no, a company do an april fools NFT, and then realise people will actually spend the money....then do it for real
[2:21:35] TelosVelox: yeah, world is way too emotional to handle jokes anymore sadly lol
[2:21:35] Skylin3r: Blizzard's fools day , kotick fired Kappa
[2:21:38] Shikiri: it'll be "fake" if ppl show interest though ConcernDoge
[2:21:42] TickleTheCohh: rooThink @OuroborosChemist But is it really protecting you if the person wearing it is the one that is infected? It'd end up being everyone else infected.
[2:21:48] moist_heinous: cyberpunk NFT April fools
[2:21:52] SuddleT: Swap stream keys with another streamer and dress up as each other
[2:21:53] AshLike: offensive is it? then good
[2:21:53] SZebra: Vtuber filters for all could be a good goof.
[2:21:53] RitzC: eh everything offends people, i wouldnt care lol
[2:21:53] W_Tile: maybe we lost the mood for April fools
[2:21:54] Nemm__: Everything is offensive to someone, people need to get over themselves more often!
[2:21:57] AinzN: I think April Fools should just die
[2:22:00] NinthDemon: say your moving to youtube

[2:37:08] TheChristopherG: BoneZone
[2:37:09] ElSpartin: I feel like there's a more basic version of this vid that needs to exist
[2:37:10] bobphrapples: I hate those type of videos
[2:37:10] TETLegion: @ThaSandus by bending it?
[2:37:14] stoiink: chat did he pick a jungler to learn yet?
[2:37:30] SchnellBier: I feel like that is basically a non guide guide
[2:37:31] the_real_beardcat: Nr. Rule of being a good jungler: Getting good
[2:37:34] Orangemorph: @ElSpartin This video is REALLY basic
[2:37:38] AinzN: stoiink I think amuamu or something
[2:37:51] ElSpartin: But can we get *more* basic @Orangemorph
[2:38:25] Orangemorph: @ElSpartin How ? He literally explains how to play jungle from the ground up LUL
[2:38:29] Lutcha81: like how basic? step 1: turn on computer, if so we have for to go
[2:38:38] Lutcha81: far*

[2:38:45] the_real_beardcat: step 1: Grab your mouse
[2:38:57] TheFall3n: Reinstall league should be the second step
[2:39:07] TelosVelox: @the_real_beardcat whoa slow down there, step 1 is think a lot and do nothing
[2:39:13] 14neo: You hear it here first folks, jungle is a mistake ijp7
[2:39:37] SchnellBier: step 1: buy a pc
[2:39:37] Orangemorph: Jungle is really fun top play if you dont listen to your teamates LUL

[2:42:25] Welanh: oof, jungle the role where you are the bitch for everything and have be everywhere at once NotLikeThis
[2:42:42] bobphrapples: don't invade if you aren't great a jg yet
[2:43:03] SilverSeraph: i feel like this video is too general and not helpful at all
[2:43:11] JimB0b0: Yeah
[2:43:20] the_real_beardcat: Nr. 1 Rule of being a good jungler: Getting good
[2:43:22] WaystedMined: Chat full of level 2 divers
[2:43:22] Cronopolis: In general, dying is bad in any rank; yea.
[2:43:28] TelosVelox: Jungle 101: Mute all and then focus on playing jungle
[2:43:28] ThaSandus: pretty much
[2:43:30] Narnun: Don't die and Kill the enemy champion
[2:43:31] Narnun: easy
[2:43:38] TheChristopherG: Rule 1. Win game
[2:43:39] Narnun: you got this
[2:43:48] SilverSeraph: like when he says "winning botlane" thats really hard to figure out if you dont know matchups
[2:43:58] ThaSandus: wait what guy?
[2:44:02] Narnun: Who is your champion of choice for this JP?
[2:44:04] stoiink: i think just experience in jungle is more important this seems so confusing
[2:44:15] epicshoo: JP on that hecarim engage POGSLIDE
[2:44:16] sin_plague: he wants to play amumu
[2:44:25] Narnun: amumu Pog

[2:44:31] bobphrapples: bot and mid, this guy smh
[2:44:59] Darkaros: state of the game is dead NOPERS
[2:45:03] zymioi: good team play he never play with random before lol
[2:45:11] TelosVelox: Nunu is a LOT of fun to play as jungle
[2:45:14] ritchie313: its super generic vid says nothing of routes sides or anything
[2:45:15] bulletsponge55: don't tower dive, be careful when you go for dragon, be careful when you invade lol
[2:45:16] Archangel3003: @itmeJP Think that's the Rengar the guy saw that was going to help in one shot yesterday lol
[2:45:18] Darkaros: the video said "state of the game" :p
[2:45:27] TelosVelox: same with Zac, just easy to learen
[2:45:28] ThaSandus: I personally loved playing Volibear jungle
[2:45:31] bobphrapples: search "amumu jungle pathing", profit
[2:45:31] Cronopolis: Glacial Augment, tank udyr is super simple and fun.
[2:45:32] TelosVelox: learn*

[2:46:03] Narnun: we are op
[2:46:15] Narnun: put me on senna and watch me dominate a damn game
[2:46:18] m3rcer: alot of this video seems like a list of stuff you need to learn but doesnt teach any of it
[2:46:50] TelosVelox: @m3rcer p good way of summing it up
[2:46:53] Shoaron: ARAM hypeE

[2:47:16] Archangel3003: I thought that was daily dose then
[2:47:21] Orangemorph: You dont really need to learn anything for jungling in silver tbh
[2:47:29] thrillhouse451: 1. Be Aware
[2:47:30] Narnun: starting with camile jungle, one of the hardest junglers
[2:47:32] its__fil: 1. FF
[2:47:34] Banana25: already better
[2:47:51] ReginaldXIV: outside of pathing and kiting, there's too many variables
[2:48:06] Cronopolis: erickdG
[2:48:09] m3rcer: this video already seems a lot better
[2:48:14] Darkaros: Hmm this do be seeming useful
[2:48:14] SilverSeraph: =]
[2:48:29] NoorElBahrain: PepoG
[2:48:35] Skyform: monica wants some 7's

[2:48:53] JustVims: There's no GCD in league
[2:49:20] m3rcer: classic kite
[2:49:22] bobphrapples: ring around the rosey
[2:49:37] Cronopolis: Wow I didn't know this was a thing LUL Diamond Player (nonjungler btw)
[2:49:45] bobphrapples: you have to also say "you can't catch me" while you do it
[2:49:50] JeedanJune: i don't consent to dmg so i never die ijpSHRUG
[2:49:54] Darkaros: kinda obvious disclaimer: don't waste your auto attack cd just to kite stripLUL
[2:49:54] Boonia: wow junglers are suppose to do that
[2:49:56] afreak10: Hmm
[2:50:02] ThatGunsFoHire: Buzzwords!
[2:50:30] Flanders125: outdated
[2:50:31] stoiink: lmao super old item
[2:50:37] SilverSeraph: this video is old BUT the mechanics apply
[2:51:00] Welanh: I think this is kinda advanced/specific for junglers who have a bad/difficult clear? (like amumu doesn't need this kiting)
[2:51:17] Cronopolis: Ivern doesn't need to kite either Kappa
[2:51:22] Infidel_Art: think so
[2:51:27] SilverSeraph: i mean if you've never jungled these are all good things to know
[2:51:50] Cronopolis: Actually, didn't they change the jungle creep movement speeds earlier this season?
[2:52:29] TheFall3n: This is a good trick
[2:52:38] afreak10: u have timers
[2:52:55] James_Blond_: you can do the same thing (aoe camps) with red and raptors
[2:53:57] TheFall3n: WUT
[2:53:57] its__fil: 5Head
[2:54:07] Narnun: cohhNotes useful video

[2:55:35] Adept_Zeno: It also makes watching hype active junglers a nightmare as they spam F1-4 every 5 sec
[2:56:12] Cronopolis: @Adept_Zeno ever seen LS stream league? LUL
[2:56:17] Welanh: sweeper? no

[2:56:22] stoiink: nope
[2:56:22] Narnun: no
[2:56:26] ritchie313: depends on jg
[2:56:30] Ebra: you can switch to it at any time
[2:56:32] Lobonidas: 50/50, depends on jungle
[2:56:34] Boonia: most start with yellow hen switchh later in game
[2:56:36] SilverSeraph: you dont start with it but alot of games i will grab sweeper after first back
[2:56:37] magnutize: sztart ward place it at like 40 sec then b and buy sweeper
[2:56:47] Flanders125: ls tries very hard to be korean, he thinks the higher the apm the better player he'll be lol
[2:56:50] afreak10: Jebaited
[2:56:50] Eravall: higher elo will start trinket ward, recall before camps spawn and swap to sweeper
[2:56:53] Gat0rCh0mp: that was a good tip
[2:56:53] Adept_Zeno: @Cronopolis Dont think so
[2:56:54] Lutcha81: unless they also see this video
[2:56:56] ReginaldXIV: laynaCrungo I'm tricked
[2:57:01] its__fil: does that mean every jungler walks in the opposite direction monkaHmm
[2:57:05] Narnun: i'm used to starcraft so quick camera is fine
[2:57:20] afreak10: ddHuh

[2:59:25] ElSpartin: PepoG
[2:59:33] afreak10: @Flanders125 just outdated
[2:59:37] Achubra: so you are going to play lee sin right
[2:59:44] Narnun: PepoG
[3:00:08] stoiink: you should watch a amumu specific guide
[3:00:09] afreak10: watch amumu jungle
[3:00:11] Darkaros: you should look up mumu-specific jungle routes
[3:00:12] Orangemorph: You should try Shyvana jungle she is very good
[3:00:13] ritchie313: you should watch one about pathing in jg
[3:00:13] cleansock42: I suggest learning Fiddlesticks jungle clearing
[3:00:19] ElSpartin: watch an amumu routing guide
[3:00:19] Infidel_Art: DansGame unranked

[3:00:24] Skyform: waht.. not 1st time ranked as new jungle?
[3:00:25] titanodin: no suggestions
[3:00:28] Lobonidas: amumu is a bit special with clearing
[3:00:28] SchnellBier: look at a path
[3:00:29] Welanh: specific guide is recommended
[3:00:38] SilverSeraph: this shows the leash range of each camp if you intend to leash them
[3:00:41] Columnedarc: udyr is always a good Champion to learn @itmejp
[3:00:42] SaboLassie: try Shyvana
[3:00:52] BlondeCow: Mumu takes the big singles way slower than the group camps
[3:01:18] bobphrapples: blue -> gromp -> wolves
[3:01:23] Narnun: amumu can do blue and grump together
[3:01:24] issalga: that was intense, like 3 or 4 messages beginning with "you should" zekeLUL
[3:01:32] bobphrapples: red -> chickens -> crugs
[3:02:00] BlondeCow: @narnun that’s sick I am a huge jungle boomer

[3:06:06] SlimmieP: We shoppin at costco today boys?
[3:06:25] stoiink: it will upgrade smite after 5 uses
[3:06:26] Narcotical: It upgrades your smite after 5 uses
[3:06:31] Brmbrmduc: you stab people
[3:06:33] vtjsuav: good afternoon @itmejp and chat
[3:06:34] AinzN: Shoaron if this makes me cry! ijpNO
[3:06:35] airy_0: buffs you basically
[3:06:39] SilverSeraph: it gives you more exp from jungle caps
[3:06:42] sin_plague: jungle mobs
[3:06:45] Shoaron: AinzN gl :)
[3:06:47] TETLegion: its passive isnt it.
[3:06:51] CrashCycle: you dont use it, its just a buff
[3:06:52] Narcotical: Nothing with the item, use smite
[3:06:54] titanodin: @itmeJP it changes your smite
[3:06:54] TETLegion: it just upgrades after using smite a few times
[3:06:54] JimB0b0: no
[3:06:55] afreak10: look the bottom consuming text
[3:06:55] shemg: when it upgrades it turns into a mini ignite
[3:06:55] Cronopolis: Ember Knife "evolves" when you use smite 5 times.
[3:06:56] stoiink: just smite jungle mobs and you will see that 5 count down
[3:07:01] P0rtilo: Most of the times mobs, but you'll use it on enemies when it's upgraded
[3:07:02] debajr: you'll use smithe, not the item itself
[3:07:03] afreak10: passive
[3:07:03] stoiink: smite frog
[3:07:03] airy_0: use smite to last hit generally
[3:07:06] Lobonidas: it upgrades after 5 smites, then you can use it against people and it reduces their dmg done to you + deals a bit of dmg
[3:07:11] JimB0b0: you are getting help here, so no
[3:07:13] stoiink: last
[3:07:13] bobphrapples: smite gromp
[3:07:13] Narcotical: Smite to killl usualy
[3:07:18] sin_plague: I'd save your smite for red, tbh
[3:07:21] xyzlime: u nned to smite 5 times to charge that and after that u can use it on enemies and camps
[3:07:22] bobphrapples: no, just smite whenever
[3:07:25] JimB0b0: smite to heal yourself
[3:07:27] bobphrapples: it heals on death
[3:07:29] P0rtilo: It heals you, so when your life can regenerate
[3:07:29] airy_0: save your smite for when you need it
[3:07:30] SilverSeraph: smite to heal. dont use it to pull
[3:07:36] Welanh: smite heals you
[3:07:36] Kyrvix: Smite will heal you, so smiting later is generally better unless you're low on hp
[3:07:41] James_Blond_: smite for damage or for heal :) best case both at the same time.
[3:07:43] aLazyDeveloper: barbCheer
[3:07:49] bobphrapples: smite now
[3:07:52] JimB0b0: @itmeJP you smite him from far away so he walks to you
[3:07:55] JimB0b0: not the other way
[3:07:56] issalga: @Shoaron zekePEPE
[3:08:00] bobphrapples: 450
[3:08:03] SilverSeraph: smite to heal
[3:08:07] Narcotical: 450 now
[3:08:09] bobphrapples: hover it
[3:08:13] Cronopolis: Try to use all 450 damage of the smite
[3:08:16] titanodin: lol just keeping the tears flowing
[3:08:18] Shoaron: @not_not_issalga, FeelsBadMan
[3:08:21] Kyriac: it tells you in the buff bar above your passive
[3:08:23] bobphrapples: nah you're good
[3:08:26] afreak10: small ones first no ?
[3:08:26] AinzN: Shoaron it didn't make me cry. I was too much enjoying the animation style
[3:08:43] ThaSandus: Remember you got F keys
[3:08:43] bobphrapples: try to peek at your lanes while you farm
[3:08:48] James_Blond_: yes
[3:08:52] bobphrapples: yes
[3:08:53] stoiink: yep
[3:08:54] sin_plague: yes
[3:08:55] afreak10: yes
[3:09:00] Shoaron: AinzN the animation still looks pretty good even today
[3:09:02] Lutcha81: remember the F1 to F4 binding before next game
[3:09:03] afreak10: smite at 450
[3:09:03] TETLegion: yes also with smite
[3:09:18] James_Blond_: yea, since you have cc for crab later.
[3:09:40] ritchie313: skuttle then top gank go go go
[3:09:42] JimB0b0: q?
[3:09:44] BuggleStrus: Max E
[3:09:49] BuggleStrus: Spam E on CD doing camps
[3:09:49] zymioi: is fair to say u can smite mobs early game but u should save smite for late game last kill shot ?
[3:09:51] Narcotical: I think you max E on Amumu
[3:09:54] James_Blond_: Max E
[3:09:54] sin_plague: usually 2 points in q, max e
[3:09:57] ElSpartin: no you gank
[3:10:00] JimB0b0: back or check bot
[3:10:02] ritchie313: gank
[3:10:15] shemg: back is fine the lanes were pushed
[3:10:17] TPLivewire: There were no lanes with open ganks so you were good really
[3:10:17] SilverSeraph: u dont need t o gank
[3:10:19] LegendsOfBobby: boots usually a good first buy too
[3:10:20] SilverSeraph: its safer to just back
[3:10:21] JimB0b0: @itmeJP buy boots first as jungle, it helps you move between camps faster
[3:10:21] TamboTv: there was nothing to gank, it was fine to back there
[3:10:22] BaldCanadianFather: to be fair everyone else backed so you couldn't really gank anyways
[3:10:24] sin_plague: amumu is slow in general
[3:10:35] flyingmangos2: Yeah you didn't have any good ganks at that time, good to back
[3:10:39] BaldCanadianFather: id try ganking after gromp
[3:10:50] Elz_7: nah use for extra damage and shield break on crab
[3:10:52] SilverSeraph: you want to smite off cooldown at the beginning to level up your smite
[3:10:56] ritchie313: Drake bot has prio
[3:11:01] ritchie313: welp they backed nvm
[3:11:01] Shoaron: scuttle is up
[3:11:01] stoiink: save smite if you have good health
[3:11:03] Cronopolis: Check Crab. Crab is a higher value camp.
[3:11:08] James_Blond_: you can check crab if you want after first clear
[3:11:10] BaldCanadianFather: get scuttle and try and ward up river area
[3:11:29] Shoaron: they saw you

[3:12:02] Shoaron: uuuh no
[3:12:03] shemg: I think you need help
[3:12:06] Shoaron: ping it
[3:12:09] James_Blond_: kite it out and ping your team
[3:12:10] TETLegion: not without items at this point
[3:12:12] Cronopolis: As amumu it might be tough. Enemy jungler is on prowl too.
[3:12:12] everkn0wn: its infernal as well
[3:12:35] TETLegion: use smite on crab you have max 2 stacks
[3:12:35] JimB0b0: need to keep one stack of smite on cd
[3:12:40] ritchie313: bot totaly threw that and died
[3:12:41] omgHylh: most used frase as jungler: why are they not helping?
[3:13:09] Shoaron: should always keep 1 smite up when dragon is up unless you know you're going to lose it
[3:13:09] Skyform: they were fighting i think
[3:13:21] TPLivewire: Yeah, they were fighting bot
[3:13:28] onehandmostly: you want sweeper btw

[3:13:55] Shoaron: see the little white bar above the HP bar?
[3:13:55] James_Blond_: @itmeJP you can check the patience bar above the monster.
[3:14:04] Kyriac: the bar above his HP shows  you his reset meter
[3:14:13] ritchie313: dont gank for bot focus top and mid they are your win condition
[3:14:16] stoiink: wait thats what that bar is??

[3:20:40] SchnellBier: oh yeah you can smite champs
[3:20:50] antroz92: ^
[3:20:57] zymioi: ^
[3:21:00] DerfOnTurf: Anything but mad is good NODDERS
[3:21:21] stoiink: does mute all also mute pings?
[3:21:23] antroz92: smite enemy
[3:21:35] zymioi: yes u can
[3:21:36] sin_plague: you can now
[3:21:40] Shoaron: ye
[3:21:40] antroz92: now that its upgraded yes
[3:21:44] slayer78456: You can once it upgrades
[3:21:48] TheTychusReaper: Blue too
[3:21:50] Shoaron: and blue
[3:21:50] stoiink: blue will slow them
[3:21:53] PennyPlaysGames: Blue smite slows
[3:21:54] Gat0rCh0mp: once it transforms off yellow
[3:21:57] stoiink: but it has to be upgraded
[3:21:57] ClearlyFrog: red is more damage blue slows
[3:21:59] Lunar688: Red does true dmg to champs. Blue slows them
[3:22:03] antroz92: simte monsters 5x then u can smite champs
[3:22:05] TETLegion: both but have different effects
[3:22:06] Cronopolis: Blue slows people, Red makes them do less damage and take more damage from you
[3:22:09] TheTychusReaper: Doesn't red also reduce damage you take from them?
[3:22:27] Cronopolis: You usually go blue smite as a tank I think.
[3:22:30] StJoshUK: yeah 20%
[3:22:46] thatguyuknow985: I've always thought rift was more valuable than dragons
[3:23:00] TheTychusReaper: Mods is there a playlist he's listening to?
[3:23:00] ElSpartin: 1 rift is better than 1 drg, but soul is very stronk
[3:23:12] ritchie313: you should hover bot drag up in 30sec
[3:23:19] slayer78456: @Cronopolis Nah it depends entirely on the champion which you want.
[3:23:30] AinzN: Clap
[3:23:39] antroz92: stealing Pog
[3:23:39] TheTychusReaper: 20 sec on drag
[3:23:49] ElSpartin: shaco hovering drag
[3:24:04] freaker286: Honestly JP, you are killing this game.
[3:24:13] antroz92: ping drag?
[3:24:17] TDotTerror: Vayne's getting smoked.
[3:24:37] debajr: are you aware u can Q twice with 3s between charges?

[3:25:37] Rdei: Clap
[3:25:41] Darkaros: first win of the day stripProud my streamer
[3:25:42] ElSpartin: need to check map more
[3:25:45] OmegaCrits: Clap
[3:25:46] JimB0b0: Early clear optimization
[3:25:46] Darkaros: you backed isntead of ganked at one point
[3:25:47] larkhill: the blue leash
[3:25:48] Shoaron: Dragon control
[3:25:49] BuggleStrus: Spam E more when clearing!!!
[3:25:49] ritchie313: no drag prio lost both early rifts
[3:25:49] Kyriac: early gank
[3:25:49] thatguyuknow985: Map awareness
[3:25:49] Cronopolis: You can use smite more optimally
[3:25:50] sin_plague: not terrible
[3:25:52] TheTychusReaper: Smiting enemies is helpful and timing camps like dragon is important
[3:25:53] titanodin: that normal mumu things
[3:25:55] James_Blond_: @itmeJP you could have contested crab after red or went bot for that crab.
[3:25:56] TETLegion: better map awareness but for a first game no complains
[3:25:58] zymioi: not smite players enough i think
[3:25:58] bobphrapples: don't worry about damage, worry about objectives
[3:25:59] 14neo: @Shoaron I see, makes sense ijpLAUGH
[3:26:01] titanodin: mumu is a CC beast not damage
[3:26:05] antroz92: when doing blue + frog, dont go that far so blue doesnt reset
[3:26:05] sin_plague: save a smite for combat in the mid to late game
[3:26:05] kainin00: kiting
[3:26:08] Shurai7: damage was normal for Amumu
[3:26:08] breadgravy: You should have gotten a pink drink from starbucks.
[3:26:14] stoiink: you can also smite jungle mobs mid fight to heal
[3:26:16] shemg: check enemies hp to gank cleaner
[3:26:22] JimB0b0: You should not go to dragon until after you gank bot
[3:26:35] antroz92: if u need a slow vs enemy team, go blue smite
[3:26:35] titanodin: ^
[3:26:42] bobphrapples: damage doesn't win games, objectives wins games
[3:26:46] titanodin: i try to win a fight bot before dragon
[3:26:49] Muffnar: Sweeper earlier
[3:26:51] Darkaros: coxStare why would you say this
[3:26:54] bobphrapples: 5 smites
[3:26:56] Kyriac: the knife at the start
[3:26:56] StJoshUK: no after 5 uses
[3:26:57] Muffnar: after u smite 5 creeps
[3:26:57] ClearlyFrog: just using it
[3:26:57] Cronopolis: 5 smite uses
[3:26:58] Almacare: What's your fallback champ if amumu is banned?
[3:26:58] BuggleStrus: just using it 5 times
[3:26:58] stoiink: based on which knife you buy at the start
[3:26:59] xyzlime: 5 smites cchange the color
[3:26:59] James_Blond_: it changes after you used it 5 times
[3:27:00] scooterjr37: its based on the item you buy
[3:27:06] thatguyuknow985: The jungle item you choose determines smite color
[3:27:07] slayer78456: It's a certain number of smites based off starting items
[3:27:12] scooterjr37: one does a slow chilling smite other i think lowers armor
[3:27:14] StJoshUK: and the colour is determined on what  item you pick
[3:27:14] TETLegion: its the item you buy, the knife. after 5 smites you automaticly upgrade it
[3:27:14] omgHylh: the item you buy determines the buff and colour
[3:27:15] antroz92: u pick
[3:27:16] ClearlyFrog: you buy it?
[3:27:17] flyingmangos2: The starting item
[3:27:17] Cookiee93: Item you buy
[3:27:18] James_Blond_: the starting item you buy
[3:27:18] bobphrapples: the purchase
[3:27:19] titanodin: starting item
[3:27:22] m3rcer: the item you bought
[3:27:23] freaker286: what you buy, there are two knifes to buy
[3:27:25] thatguyuknow985: Yeah the starting item
[3:27:26] ClearlyFrog: its your first item
[3:27:26] slayer78456: The knife you buy at the start it gets consumed when it upgrades
[3:27:30] BuggleStrus: red or blue knife
[3:27:30] StJoshUK: red = 20% damage reduction  blue = true dmg and slow
[3:27:34] ClearlyFrog: blue is usually better for amumu
[3:27:34] slayer78456: As amumu I'd go red smite
[3:27:39] StJoshUK: no 20% dmg on a target is clean for a tank
[3:27:41] antroz92: if u need a slow, go blue
[3:27:43] Cronopolis: it depends on your gameplan. I like blue for tanks.
[3:27:43] bobphrapples: red smite for amumu is good
[3:27:45] flyingmangos2: Ember knife is still pretty good for the damage reduction from a champ
[3:27:45] StJoshUK: but subjective
[3:27:51] slayer78456: You have plenty of CC so blue isn't necessary
[3:27:52] TDotTerror: The Duality of Chat
[3:28:00] thatguyuknow985: Red is probably best for amumu
[3:28:06] bobphrapples: you want red to reduce champion damage on the champ you smite
[3:28:06] Muffnar: Depends on the matchup
[3:28:07] the_real_beardcat: I would call the river king
[3:28:11] xyzlime: red ember reduce champs damage towrds u
[3:28:12] titanodin: league is fun again \o/
[3:28:14] stoiink: he does very little damage though
[3:28:18] stoiink: mostly cc
[3:28:23] Shoaron: Ivern clears pretty quick
[3:28:26] JimB0b0: you're amumu, you can't really invade
[3:28:28] cleansock42: odds are Ivern is going to invade you
[3:28:32] Brytice: @itmeJP The starting jungle item is red or blue, after you've used Smite 5 times they upgrade and are removed from your inventory and your Smite get's buffed (and allows you to us it on enemy champions)
[3:28:36] antroz92: ur slow KEKW
[3:28:37] 99flamey: Ivern means he’s going to invade you a lot actually LUL
[3:28:38] Shurai7: please dont invade as Amumu
[3:28:54] antroz92: jungle route?
[3:29:02] thatguyuknow985: Are you starting red or blue?
[3:29:03] debajr: crab you mean?
[3:29:03] TETLegion: you mean gank after red instead rocks?
[3:29:05] James_Blond_: you can contest crab after red
[3:29:06] ElSpartin: you may need to rephrase that, it didnt make any sense
[3:29:07] shemg: depends on how the top and mid lane look
[3:29:08] zymioi: @Shurai7 i feel like u have ptsd from amumu
[3:29:09] Shoaron: red>wolves>blue>frog?
[3:29:10] thatguyuknow985: Go crab
[3:29:13] bobphrapples: if you want to do full clear, then yes
[3:29:18] titanodin: krugs is rocks
[3:29:20] slayer78456: I wouldn't recommend early invading.
[3:29:20] BaldCanadianFather: gank after krugs
[3:29:32] Gat0rCh0mp: need to learn scuttle control too
[3:29:35] avgrojm: Ask team toward red so ivern does not steal
[3:29:38] bobphrapples: you can 3-4 camp gank
[3:29:48] stoiink: i like to go crab before krugs on some champs
[3:29:54] shemg: viego clears very fast
[3:30:16] BaldCanadianFather: as amumu? yea
[3:30:19] TheTychusReaper: Smite heals you so i don't normally use the bottle early
[3:30:26] shemg: yea
[3:30:27] antroz92: YEP
[3:30:32] BaldCanadianFather: one of the slower ones iirc
[3:30:40] Shoaron: early game he doesclear slow
[3:30:56] cleansock42: yeah thats why he is in a bad spot =(
[3:30:59] TheTychusReaper: Don't take Ignite
[3:31:01] slayer78456: You definitely want flash
[3:31:07] TheTychusReaper: Flash is WAY better for Amumu - he's a playmaker
[3:31:09] Shurai7: you can flash ult and then Q to keep them in place for a long time
[3:31:09] xyzlime: no u want flash
[3:31:10] Muffnar: No
[3:31:11] JimB0b0: You don't want to 1v1 as amumu
[3:31:15] JimB0b0: you are a cc bot
[3:31:15] freaker286: One long-term thing, generally want to save skill up for right before fighting. If you get into a lv 1 fight, you want q for stun
[3:31:16] antroz92: big flash plays
[3:31:17] Ozoaken: amumu is a play for team jungler flash lets you flash in and r enemy team
[3:31:19] shemg: I don't think they stack but not sure
[3:31:21] cleansock42: if you are looking for 1v1 you should change champs
[3:31:21] Shoaron: Flash + R is still very strong for mumu
[3:31:23] BaldCanadianFather: you can hide in brush, then flash Q and ult to catch their entire team
[3:31:24] SchnellBier: flash for placing ultis
[3:31:25] Muffnar: You Q into team and flash for better ult position
[3:31:25] 99flamey: If you want to 1v1 your gonna need a new champ
[3:31:29] slayer78456: The only champs that don't take flash are like shaco who has insane mobility
[3:31:53] titanodin: @itmeJP your not kiting gromp right
[3:31:54] BaldCanadianFather: or yeah, Q into team, then flash behind front line to squishies and ult
[3:32:06] Nathanisms: dont forget touse your pot charges JP
[3:32:19] ElSpartin: gromp kite is 1 auto back, 1 auto back for 5 of gromp autos
[3:32:26] Askann: it's OK, you don't need to know how to kite right away
[3:32:31] antroz92: i think if the monster moves then u did it right?
[3:32:33] svensonidis: stuuter step? like you do with marines in starcraft

[3:32:56] BaldCanadianFather: you can save now since you dont need to gank top
[3:32:56] freaker286: if you think fighting, or svae if not
[3:33:11] Ozoaken: first scuttle isnt worth much, if it isnt safe to take dont bother with it
[3:33:12] titanodin: good krug kiting
[3:33:29] antroz92: seems it involves being aware of how lanes are doing
[3:33:34] ElSpartin: C R A B

[3:36:59] PennyPlaysGames: @NDUDINEMESIS It's the U.gg addon
[3:37:01] Muffnar: Little bit of a micro misplay but noticing the fight and ignoring gromp and going in was really good jp
[3:37:03] antroz92: nvm
[3:37:06] StJoshUK: Yasuo E has a time out on all minions and champions
[3:37:17] zymioi: @LokiTheHarvester did one survive and walk away ??
[3:37:17] StJoshUK: Can only do it once every about 10ish secs
[3:37:18] Ozoaken: yasuo dash has very short cooldown to use again, but cant be used on the same target for a longer cooldown
[3:37:42] LokiTheHarvester: @zymioi for a little while, but both the sup and adc died i think
[3:37:45] dawegar: @StJoshUK no can do it on repeat to new targets

[3:54:50] LokiTheHarvester: i think you are doing very well for a new role

[3:55:00] OmegaCrits: @itmeJP dont forget sweeper
[3:55:03] antroz92: that wasnt worth dying for, adc was already dead
[3:55:08] antroz92: no objective

[3:56:13] freaker286: once you by sweeper, need to be sure you are buying pinks as well to keep up putting out vision
[3:56:46] ritchie313: darius is also darius lol

[3:56:55] LokiTheHarvester: yikes man, just got rolled over
[3:56:58] ElSpartin: annie had a very bad lane phase and darius darius'd all over your team
[3:57:03] zymioi: this is a hard match up
[3:57:03] dawegar: try not to engage but peel for zeri
[3:57:13] dawegar: they want u to engage
[3:57:16] Ozoaken: looked like yasuo got onto your backline and didnt get hit by your ult
[3:57:27] antroz92: ^
[3:57:30] LokiTheHarvester: ult just barely missed yas
[3:57:42] Nako_Bocchi: hey chat and jp, hows the jungle so far? stripSip
[3:57:49] slayer78456: Ahri beats annie in general so it's a rough game for them

[3:58:11] epicshoo: furryRun

[3:58:36] antroz92: 2/7?
[3:58:41] Ozoaken: you had a very small window to steak, but assuming its gone prevents you from running in and dying like that
[3:58:48] Ozoaken: *steal
[3:58:49] LokiTheHarvester: @Ozoaken at the least we could have traped them in the pit and 5v3 them
[3:59:10] Shoaron: JP's KDA is a lil ijpSUS

[3:59:42] Achubra: i think the issue is you don't have the porcelain amumu skin
[3:59:50] AinzN: Jammies
[4:00:01] dawegar: peel dont engage it stops their dive and combo
[4:00:07] bobphrapples: @Achubra u right
[4:00:07] SchnellBier: MmmHmm
[4:00:10] Kyuukotsu: @Achubra Funny enough I just got that through a loot box today. LUL
[4:00:18] epicshoo: yasuo sniping that backline
[4:00:20] dawegar: good effort
[4:00:22] antroz92: again yasuo in back line
[4:00:23] AinzN: That was a good Ult from you
[4:00:37] dawegar: ur ult saved zeri so can clean up
[4:00:39] Narcotical: Zeri couldve cleaned that all up probably
[4:00:44] antroz92: bodyguard zeri
[4:00:56] LokiTheHarvester: @Narcotical she played too scared
[4:02:04] Shoaron: yall got no wards
[4:02:13] antroz92: ads.... but i think its best to wait for yas in backline to q then ult team?
[4:02:53] ritchie313: down side to playing mumu is you cant carry in these positions
[4:02:56] Narcotical: Enemy team just wants to dive backline so its probably best to just peel for the carries ye
[4:03:17] Edokdyshi: stop Yazuo. ult him if can probably
[4:03:21] Nako_Bocchi: your ult needs to hit yas and darius, so that zeri can stay safe
[4:03:22] antroz92: ^
[4:03:32] dawegar: drag
[4:03:47] bobphrapples: you have to ping for help, people are brain dead

[4:05:18] dawegar: ur ult doesnt need to be perfet take picjs when available
[4:05:26] LokiTheHarvester: flash ult would have killed darius
[4:05:27] dawegar: picks
[4:06:38] Narcotical: @LokiTheHarvester And probably stunned yas
[4:06:59] Achubra: you didnt hit your active that fight too
[4:07:27] LokiTheHarvester: sunfire procs off attacking heros i think?
[4:07:34] bobphrapples: stoneplate would have saved him
[4:07:50] Strivus: Hey JP, how you doing?

[4:12:40] Strivus: JP, any thoughts on Triangle Strategy? Are SRPGs  something you like?
[4:12:56] Ozoaken: another thing that ive found useful for ganking is to use the "on my way" ping so that your laner is more likely to notice you going in
[4:13:00] SpiritOfBlaze: Usually you ward pixel bush, which is the small bush in the river, that''s near your opposite bush your starting
