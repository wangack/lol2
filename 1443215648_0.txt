[0:23:16] tim_beh: ugh visual clutter overload
[0:23:17] SixPointFive: Looks cool, but seems really floaty
[0:23:21] BlueSapphyre: spoilers.
[0:23:22] VoltecZero: FOV too narrow for a game this speed
[0:23:34] VoltecZero: It's going to make people nauseus
[0:23:35] woschdvendetta: i'm kinda only interested in this game from a technical standpoint, looks great and has the first directstorage implementation
[0:23:35] UnboundSouls: kinda looks like DMC but in ye ole era
[0:23:38] SixPointFive: I could see tons of terrain interaction errors
[0:23:45] MagnaCarter_: I really like the amount of spells you seem to have
[0:23:48] zerohour_88: the casting thing could be fun with all the effects going on
[0:23:49] GrateWhiteDope: Why's the text weird as fuck?

[0:23:54] ZeoBishop: spolier D:
[0:24:04] aurice_heartly: when is JP gonna April Fool us?
[0:24:12] ThemDemo: Looks like there is no melee combat at all?
[0:24:14] Reijm11: I wonder how much the ability swapping is going to be necessary or if you can just spam some
[0:24:17] bastionsan: the only thing that i not super into is the faact that you have to pause combat to "cast"
[0:24:17] eviltox: is this 30 fps?
[0:24:17] GrateWhiteDope: cLuStER bOLT LUL
[0:24:21] jediknight223: @ThemDemo Looks like it.

[0:25:12] rich16bit: Hopefully you can turn it off
[0:25:17] lazyxzone: camera is whacky
[0:25:24] Riluske: I'm really hoping that's just for beta and will be taken out/modified for final release
[0:25:28] cyberronic: so, uhm, how often are they gonna say that she just wants back home?
[0:25:31] Shapelessdnb: Don't know if this makes sense but the particle work seems very uninspired
[0:25:55] bastionsan: i hope sp
[0:25:58] thrillhouse451: Hot take
[0:25:59] bastionsan: so*
[0:25:59] BlazeRom: you just gotta get that 3090ti
[0:25:59] UnboundSouls: also the character/camera are spazzing out because the model keeps moving over different height terrain
[0:26:07] zerohour_88: Luminous engine right? that thing was pretty heavy
[0:26:10] VoltecZero: I feel woozy already watching this
[0:26:36] Lolleer: it feels like whoever is playing is struggling to keep up with the speed of the combat
[0:26:45] BlazeRom: yeah, combat and traversal seems fun
[0:26:46] eviltox: considering Squere Enix notorious PC optimization i wouldn't get my hopes up
[0:26:50] Ritzadette: that's kinda melee
[0:26:55] BlazeRom: the writing and talking...eehe
[0:26:57] MisterWhims: so far the game seems very empty
[0:26:57] ThemDemo: Looks like its a pretty big and EMPTY open world
[0:26:58] BigWaldo7713: still feels like a tech demo to me
[0:27:03] UnboundSouls: Sadge
[0:27:04] kuronomiya: I feel this game does not have a very good artistic identity
[0:27:08] SlipCrit: wasnt 15 good on pc tho? and this is the same team?

[0:27:21] BlazeRom: BEG

[0:27:48] Kaleith: this is gonna be a nightmare to stream, those particles and light effects don't play well with compression
[0:27:48] bastionsan: KEKW

[0:27:50] GrateWhiteDope: lol ya
[0:27:57] GunzGames: It's certainly triggering me
[0:27:59] yoyourmister: @Datdudedean34 forspoken
[0:27:59] KoRnyRocks: This really doesn’t impress me at all.
[0:28:11] JeedanJune: ye it will be like Warframe with bitrate @Kaleith
[0:28:12] SlipCrit: @restart no it literally is the same it just has western writers they worked with
[0:28:13] UnboundSouls: i guess they have so many effects the only way to identify that enemies have debuffs on them is text
[0:28:20] DoctorJohn: sup chat
[0:28:22] Voidheim: what game is this?
[0:28:24] DoctorJohn: hi JP
[0:28:26] BrunoMacx: is this warframe?
[0:28:28] BigWaldo7713: forspoken
[0:28:28] Kaleith: forspoken
[0:28:30] bastionsan: @Voidheim forspoken
[0:28:35] GunzGames: The world looks Dead
[0:28:35] ItsBatsy: The skybox looks terrible lol
[0:28:36] kuronomiya: Yeah, doesn't have much going on
[0:28:37] WestElmCaleb: Ya after you’ve played Elden ring, the standard for these types of games is pretty high
[0:28:37] titanodin: i see that
[0:28:38] zerohour_88: Dragon Dogma 2 soon COPIUM
[0:28:39] ThemDemo: It is going to be hard playing open world games like this after Horizon and Elden Ring
[0:28:39] Riluske: Looks like people are going to have massive bitrate issues while streaming it
[0:28:41] DoctorJohn: the movement does look very satisfying
[0:28:44] pa_TIENce: I wish Parkour Magic is a real thing
[0:28:47] gooseboy429: kinda seems like infamous
[0:28:52] Sonatta: i hate that it's called parkour magic...
[0:28:52] BlazeRom: maybe that's why the traversal is so fast
[0:28:54] jediknight223: It does feel like Warframe with the movement.
[0:28:54] BigWaldo7713: fall damage :(
[0:28:55] eke____: i must admit i like the speed of the game zoom zoom
[0:28:57] timecod: unreal engine 5  ?
[0:28:59] Kaleith: formerly known as projectathia, gary whitta worked on its writing
[0:29:05] BigWaldo7713: omg
[0:29:09] eviltox: ff15 engine
[0:29:09] Vivelin: Who actually likes having fall damage?
[0:29:11] BigWaldo7713: that diamond system is the same as tales LUL
[0:29:17] zerohour_88: Luminous engine, same as FFXV
[0:29:18] SirCris: at least you can do a double jump at the end to save yourself
[0:29:18] BigWaldo7713: i just noticed
[0:29:28] freetownJoe: Would this come out on ps++
[0:29:30] BigWaldo7713: use the diamonds to use big attacks
[0:29:33] WestElmCaleb: This looks so threadbare honestly
[0:29:36] Keyah: That's a DBD killer...
[0:29:47] moist_heinous: we've been spoiled with elden ring so this looks pretty empty in comparison
[0:29:48] ThemDemo: Oh there is melee, I saw a magic sword
[0:29:49] Borovier: I hope you can change the outfit. I've never liked the combination of modern clothes with fantasy worlds
[0:29:57] aurice_heartly: what game is this?
[0:29:58] zerohour_88: was that an invi frame on the dodge roll
[0:29:59] SleepyDutchNub: What is this weird commentary
[0:30:07] UnboundSouls: i can hear my GPU melting already
[0:30:08] Sjibbie: HEre is hoping it is not going to be the same combo over and over to easily beat everything
[0:30:09] BlueSapphyre: i'm super hyped for this game. it looks great.
[0:30:09] kuronomiya: ijpNOPERS
[0:30:09] Kaleith: I wasn't excited before and I'm not now, thanks
[0:30:22] BigWaldo7713: i hope i can turn off the text LUL
[0:30:23] BaldurCZ: i dunno, very "meh" for me..
[0:30:27] woschdvendetta: def waiting for reviews for this one
[0:30:28] SlipCrit: i feel liek im the only person actually excited for this LUL
[0:30:34] ThemDemo: If the story doesnt pull me in this game is going to be hard to sell me on
[0:30:38] Ritzadette: bye
[0:30:42] burgerpirate: This looks like a deep discount type of game
[0:30:46] eviltox: Now this is a trigger for me when developers say "beautiful to look at" not "exciting to play'
[0:30:48] r0digan: I think the combat looks great
[0:30:53] EseTss: Forspoken 80euro on steam for me...
[0:31:00] KingRahe: Looks cool but the switch like framerate hurts my brain
[0:31:06] BigWaldo7713: ill wait for sale
[0:31:08] eke____: i definitely would be interested but it costs 80 fucking euro
[0:31:12] WestElmCaleb: I think after Elden Ring, open world games have to jam pack the content in in order to justify the openness
[0:31:12] SlipCrit: that wasnt a dev tho eviltox LUL
[0:31:28] SirCris: it's the first $70 game I believe
[0:31:37] GunzGames: IMO it just looks like a glorified tech demo. A World void of life with some real pretty spells
[0:31:41] WestElmCaleb: Otherwise give me a more closed, linear experience
[0:31:55] Vilerious: another empty open world game
[0:32:02] eviltox: @SlipCrit it is somebody well conected to show off

[0:37:48] WestElmCaleb: Only password manager i use is iOS
[0:37:53] OuroborosChemist: common word+3-5random numbers+another common word is sorta strong for password, write it down on physical notebook stored in secure location
[0:37:54] Shoaron: @sonatta, ijpH
[0:37:55] Heisuisui: ppl are stupid
[0:38:01] tecwa: yeah i don't trust onlien password services so i only use local keepass :|
[0:38:03] Sonatta: @Shoaron ijpH
[0:38:07] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP The one I use requires a 12 digit password plus it have a 2FA as a requriement
[0:38:10] BarryCarlyon: What are you doing?
[0:38:11] OcGhost: Do not use online password managers
[0:38:16] itmeBOT: If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!

[0:38:22] bakavic: always use 2fa
[0:38:27] ItsBatsy: physical security keys are a must
[0:38:31] UnboundSouls: he would have been better off using 1 password for everything he used
[0:38:35] Tocavian: Work in a company related to banking, and our email comes up when you search a specific bank on google. We get a BUNCH of emails from people who have been scammed that includes ALL their details.
[0:38:35] DannyDeVitosHairline: easiest way is to never save passwords and just tattoo them onto you everytime you get a new one lol
[0:38:37] Snowl3opard1: Password manager plus hardware key or 2fa.
[0:38:40] xIGBClutchIx: SMS is so bad
[0:38:42] miirro4: yea was thinking of switching to keepass as well. The typical services are just too damn convenient...
[0:38:46] itmeBOT: Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[0:38:49] Vivelin: Oh yeah, SMS 2FA is bad
[0:38:54] OuroborosChemist: @ItsBatsy yes cannot be broken without physical access
[0:38:57] eviltox: get password manager for your password managers, simple
[0:38:57] Zizen: SMS is the worst form of 2FA
[0:38:58] Riluske: Yeah, simswap is a big issue
[0:38:58] Zeltoo: sms is like plain text..wtf
[0:38:59] StevoRay: SMS can be spoofed to another phone.

[0:39:14] WestElmCaleb: Everything important i have nowadays is 2FA - bank, credit card, email, investment accounts, etc. Everything else isnt that big of a  deal if it gets hacked
[0:39:14] woschdvendetta: traditional phone standards are inherently weak
[0:39:14] afreak10: WeirdDude

[0:39:37] UnboundSouls: dont have to deal with that shit
[0:39:38] bansheehero: Offlien password manager, no simple passwords nowhere and 2FA when possible.
[0:39:39] quaxim: I didn't get a go live tweet :(
[0:39:47] stewieboiiii: I use Microsoft Authenticator for all of my 2FA stuff, SMS is too unsecure
[0:39:50] Gorn_Vernaleer: @nuiben it's very easy
[0:39:51] quaxim: It does
[0:39:52] XayDay: Ramadan Kareem for who is doing it ijpLOVE
[0:39:52] UrsusLvovich: there was a fascinating video from a hacker conference of a reporter challenging someone to socially engineer his bank information. She got it so easy
[0:39:54] woschdvendetta: all current biometric means of security are spoofable, in some cases very easily
[0:39:54] ThePointGaming: its still a person taking the phone call...so yeah unfortunately
[0:39:54] bansheehero: but 2FA without a password is dumb too.
[0:39:55] BlueSapphyre: yes it helps.

[0:40:03] yrvengalied: it helps
[0:40:06] ThemDemo: I just get the twitch notifications
[0:40:07] NiloxofAsgard: discord plus twitter always is good to let me know when you go live
[0:40:08] GunzGames: I used to work at an ATT call center. The number of security breaches we had in a week at a single call center was dumb-founding
[0:40:10] Shapelessdnb: I'm not on Twitter and I like it that way NODDERS
[0:40:11] quaxim: I was hoping we could get notifis in the community @itmeJP
[0:40:11] DannyDeVitosHairline: phone customer service is based on time, they want you in and out so they can have more customers. They will easily fall for scams
[0:40:12] ElSpartin: It helps me. I only have 2 major ways of knowing a channe is live and thats one of them
[0:40:13] JeedanJune: ye that's what i do @bansheehero but moving the new manager with updated passwords sucks but heyy only gotta do it once a year lol
[0:40:14] madhei: @Mana_Sora April 12
[0:40:14] quaxim: but its not poss

[0:43:18] SchnellBier: well it would be weird to make a show about the same story that the already cinematic games tell
[0:43:28] Gorn_Vernaleer: @cyberronic it's still a cool setting
[0:43:31] WestElmCaleb: LUL the video game of halo had the most barebones story all time
[0:43:36] Sonatta: Master Chief is alone for most of Halo 1
[0:43:36] BlazeRom: John Wick?

[0:43:48] gigamesh00: well they go towards the alien politic
[0:43:48] woschdvendetta: flipping vehicles for 20 minutes of each episode would be kinda funny tho
[0:43:49] SlipCrit: well thats what the books are for. but they didnt even do that
[0:43:50] ElSpartin: weird
[0:43:52] anywhere_but_here_: I liked the books more than the games

[0:44:17] xIGBClutchIx: The one thing I hate was that first person point of view thing. It reminded me of that Doom movie.
[0:44:18] WestElmCaleb: Ya you expect pg to pg13
[0:44:18] afreak10: with the amount of blood first episode had
[0:44:18] Archangel3003: I saw a tweet of someone saying they didn't know if that second episode of Halo was an April fools and needed to watch it again to see.

[0:46:13] Darkaros: AinzN ijpH Nilox ijpLOVE
[0:46:14] PenguinPowered: heating up sand hot enough turns it to glass..
[0:46:15] woofser: @itmeJP Did you glass some planets in Stellaris yesterday?

[0:46:23] WestElmCaleb: I feel like its generally also used as slang for “getting annihilated”
[0:46:25] 8mmspikes: Hit a planet with so much lazors that it turns sand to glass
[0:46:28] Heisuisui: the protoss approach
[0:46:28] LeelandGrant: heat that melts stone and leaves a ceramic behind
[0:46:32] BarryCarlyon: Super heated sand innit
[0:46:33] OuroborosChemist: @Shapelessdnb you fry the planets surface by orbital bombartment so all etc sand turns to class cause it melts
[0:46:34] NinjaPandaEU: Using high energy weapons to turn a planetary surface into glass.
[0:46:34] Mondo_Gibbs: Exterminatus geefHypers
[0:46:35] altizar: When a nuke goes off, it generates enough heat to turn silcate rock into glass.
[0:46:35] BanjoRol: Omg the worst music man
[0:46:35] lootin_and_shootin: vitrification
[0:46:46] raptorscream: @itmeJP high temps turn Sand into Glass

[0:46:58] unreliable_witness: Yeah, apply enough heat to sand it turns into glass. And nukes do have that heat. Simple. Very real.
[0:47:09] lootin_and_shootin: lightning strikes cause sand to turn to glass. vitrification
[0:47:11] DoctorJohn: yah
[0:47:13] DoctorJohn: it did indeed
[0:47:14] Shapelessdnb: @Shapelessdnb Interesting
[0:47:14] ElSpartin: radially

[0:47:21] kuronomiya: ijpNODDERS
[0:47:24] altizar: doesn't have to be just sand
[0:47:25] DoctorJohn: I always thougth that was where the term" glassing" came from
[0:47:25] JeedanJune: yea i've been to a glass factory when i was little, it was so fucking cool how they do it
[0:47:27] Miros__: not "all", but a lot
[0:47:28] Heisuisui: from US war crimes
[0:47:34] bansheehero: From testing, it is green
[0:47:35] epicshoo: did someone just tell you how glass is made? WTFF
[0:47:39] BigWaldo7713: america #1
[0:47:41] BarryCarlyon: sci fi glassing is "bigger" sicne it melts everything. where as so far we on;y tend to do sand generally. :-P
[0:47:43] JeedanJune: @DoctorJohn yeh that's what i thought too
[0:47:46] raptorscream: FBI agent looking at JP's search "hmm, Nuke Glassing"
[0:47:47] Hemry64_: Oh theres a lot we gloss over KEKW
[0:47:50] DoctorJohn: we absolutely were covering up/whitewashing shit like that
[0:47:53] DannyDeVitosHairline: yeah it was pretty bad
[0:47:54] CocoScruff: the atrocities that we created? yea... they don't tell us about any of that LUL
[0:47:54] ElSpartin: no they just gloss over it, bascialyl saying 2 dropped one, they didnt surrender so we did another and that was it
[0:48:00] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP it barely teaches history
[0:48:01] ThemDemo: Yeah, pretty bad shit
[0:48:03] Shapelessdnb: Kinda weird
[0:48:04] BarryCarlyon: Super heat anything quickly it goes real weird.
[0:48:05] WestElmCaleb: Ya, it was one of the all time fcked up things
[0:48:06] Freezetrap: American history class (all history classes really) are very selective in what they tell "Winners write history"
[0:48:10] boxofpants: you would be in class for another couple years if they didn't gloss over stuff
[0:48:10] DoctorJohn: oh yeah i had to read Japanese-perspective material or non-US material to realize just how fucked up things were after the bombs dropped
[0:48:11] BigWaldo7713: ya since they were negotiaiting surrender beforehand
[0:48:13] bansheehero: do they even still teach internment camps in the US?
[0:48:15] Keyah: This thing happened. These are the key points. Gonna ignore everything else, moving on
[0:48:16] SlipCrit: atrocities and taxes2 things the US doesnt teach you
[0:48:19] unreliable_witness: That is fucked up. If nothing else American schools _should_ teach you the spesifics. We learned in Europe.
[0:48:20] AinzN: Yeah my history classes in school was all about Scotland and how England fucked us over NODDERS
[0:48:20] raptorscream: Winners dictate history
[0:48:21] breadgravy: yeahhh American history classes really love to gloss over stuff.
[0:48:21] bansheehero: and yes it comes from testing sites in the US
[0:48:34] Brandon_Scales: @itmeJP its called Trinitite
[0:48:38] eviltox: lets hope US won't decide to repeat that mistake
[0:48:40] DannyDeVitosHairline: the axis.
[0:48:41] BigWaldo7713: its like russia won the war but now people believe america won it
[0:48:42] DoctorJohn: @boxofcraniums of all the things we gloss over, that probably shouldn't be it lol
[0:48:43] raptorscream: @itmeJP lighting strikes in desert create "glass trees"
[0:48:46] Dr_Whoot: Axis Powers baby
[0:48:46] angryhonkinggoose: You wouldnt believe the Anti-Americanism in the rest of the world, the history is perceived quite differently.
[0:48:48] kuronomiya: Yeah i saw that
[0:48:48] BigWaldo7713: its weird
[0:48:51] Javtastrophe: wild
[0:48:54] raptorscream: Japan is still at war with Russia
[0:48:56] WiFi_802: yeah japan do not teach that at all
[0:49:00] Zizen: the US really like removing the ugly parts from its history
[0:49:01] Miros__: History is written by the winners.
[0:49:03] Archangel3003: There seems to be a whole lot of revisionism (That a word?) in American teaching at school.
[0:49:03] kuronomiya: Japan was pretty savage in ww2
[0:49:05] WestElmCaleb: Ya Japan wants the Atolls now
[0:49:06] Heisuisui: a lot of the sides do that
[0:49:07] bobotea: japan is wak they dont teach ww2
[0:49:07] OhPatooie: Japan censors alot of the atrocities of their war
[0:49:07] BrunoMacx: history in north america tend to remove a lot of the war crimes and blame from that period
[0:49:08] unreliable_witness: @raptorscream Those are really damn cool looking. The glass trees I mean. Exceedingly rare, but damn
[0:49:13] SchnellBier: well there is a reason why the US reputation isn't as good as they see themself
[0:49:14] LeelandGrant: @angryhonkinggoose thruth has a well known liberal bias
[0:49:16] Disgustingstache: YEah that isn't shocking because Japan has actively tried to forget that part of their past, just as Germany has done as well.
[0:49:16] DoctorJohn: Japan, on the other hand, glosses over a ton of their own war atrocities too. we're all guilty and nobody is good
[0:49:20] bansheehero: You can glass that shit over Kappa
[0:49:21] woschdvendetta: every country does
[0:49:25] OuroborosChemist: A-bombs were overated fire bombing Tokyp killed 3 times more ppl than A-bombs together differes is while A-bombs there was plain, Tokyo bombingwas done by hundreds of bombers
[0:49:26] BigWaldo7713: oh ya
[0:49:27] CocoScruff: ALL the maps LUL
[0:49:28] altizar: not just the US everbody revises history
[0:49:29] Heisuisui: KEKW
[0:49:30] DannyDeVitosHairline: still crazy to me that american history only started in 1776.
[0:49:31] BigWaldo7713: imperial japan was FUCKED
[0:49:33] buzzkillington_: Trying being British, they don't teach you any of the fuck up shit we did
[0:49:33] kuronomiya: I THOUGH THE SAME LUL
[0:49:34] ZcottD: lmao
[0:49:34] SMonTwitch: NODDERS accurate
[0:49:34] Phen0m: LUL
[0:49:36] ElSpartin: Look it could be good if juiced
[0:49:38] OnePunchMac: The UK removes nasty part from its history too
[0:49:40] DoctorJohn: Germany i dont think tries to whitewash, they acknowledge nazi-ism as their history and ban all aspects of it afaik
[0:49:40] Freezetrap: Atoll is probably my favorite map XD
[0:49:42] thepresenterv: wonder what kids learn about 9/11 in school nowadays
[0:49:43] Shoaron: every country tries to remove the ugly parts of its histroy from history
[0:49:43] ShrowdArrow: ijpLAUGH
[0:49:44] raptorscream: Japan will start pushing to get their island back from Russia, that will be a nice way to end the WW2 war for them
[0:49:49] CocoScruff: yay imperialism!
[0:49:51] WeeMr_Goodcat: ooo total war warhammer 1 is free on epic. get grab
[0:49:52] kuronomiya: Thought*
[0:49:53] DannyDeVitosHairline: our empire was disgusting.
[0:49:54] vaizard27: @Disgustingstache yeah, that's why we have 4 years of only ww2 in school and visit concentration camps like thrice during our school-life
[0:50:01] Athisyy: Germany teaches you all of it danShame
[0:50:04] WGD118: @DoctorJohn They have almost gone the other way though, in basically banning free speech
[0:50:04] DoctorJohn: i mean our history classes dont teach us our imperial colonizers gave vast swaths of Native Americans blankets with smallpox
[0:50:10] Boshean: everywhere is really fucked stripNote
[0:50:12] BarryCarlyon: You can read more on it on wikipedai https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitite its on the opening paragraph
[0:50:12] ShrowdArrow: [INSERT_COUNTRY_HERE] is really bad at teaching history
[0:50:18] Shapelessdnb: Netherlands does a decent bit I think. Atleast a part about slavery etc
[0:50:19] Disgustingstache: @vaizard27 Fair point. I concede.
[0:50:25] unreliable_witness: @DoctorJohn I think they've been doing good work with it. Not denying and making sure everyone knows it's not to be repeated.
[0:50:26] Archangel3003: @onepunchmac Yeah the parts from back when we used to be "Great" Britain.
[0:50:26] DoctorJohn: @WGD118 that's only true if you believe Q-anon shit dude. Careful what you read.
[0:50:30] Gorn_Vernaleer: @DoctorJohn bullshit
[0:50:31] Tocavian: Depends where in Britain, if you're Irish, Welsh or Scottish it happened to your ancestors as well.
[0:50:32] BigWaldo7713: canada does a good job diving into our history
[0:50:38] SleepyDutchNub: @Shapelessdnb no we dont. we look like hero's when doing slavery
[0:50:41] bansheehero: You can watch veritasium video :)
