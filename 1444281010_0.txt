[1:06:28] the_real_beardcat: why not use a cheap ass keyboard and use auto hotkey?
[1:06:32] GassyMexican: Why did I never think to use that for discord
[1:06:50] DoctorJohn: my mute button for discord on my keyboard malfunctions sometimes too, steamdecks are pretty good
[1:06:50] freaktechnik: the stream deck is probably also about 10x less effort
[1:06:56] SirCris: need that single button keyboard
[1:06:58] Lutcha81: get the Corsair K1 ;)
[1:07:00] DoctorJohn: LUL wow JP just out swinging today
[1:07:00] the_real_beardcat: well there are small keyboards too
[1:07:03] sneakypooo: You can buy just a number pad for real cheap.
[1:07:04] GassyMexican: Now I fear the muscle memory to mute unmute etc is too strong
[1:07:06] DoctorJohn: fists flying
[1:07:10] Slittyfungus: 20% keyboards are cheaper than that an the same size so
[1:07:10] GassyMexican: That I’d get it and forget to use it
[1:07:15] sin_plague: if only you had that april fools corsair 1 button keyboard to replace that with
[1:07:18] BarryCarlyon: Stream deck also added an official discord plugin recently. At the same time they announced the footpedal
[1:07:25] GassyMexican: Nah keyboard
[1:07:37] NoorElBahrain: Is it my time to recommend VIA compatible tiny keyboards and macropads??!
[1:07:41] GassyMexican: Backslash for hard mute
[1:07:48] MrMontyHShah: there's a lot of maxes in twitch land
[1:07:53] GassyMexican: Side button on mouse for push ti mute
[1:07:57] bonusOnTwitch: I've had a 2-switch foot pedal for years and it's fantastic. PTT is easy-- one switch for in-game, one for discord.

[1:09:11] DoctorJohn: when i bought my Corsair MMO mouse I had to manually program each single button on the mouse (14 times) to just be numbers
[1:09:14] GassyMexican: Side button on mouse to push mute is a solid move tho, cuz when talking in game for voip, you bind the same button. No double talk ijpEZ

[2:43:40] AinzN: Ah so he's League's version of Centaur from Dota 2
[2:43:59] Mondo_Gibbs: @AinzN he is a centaur that hits harder the faster he runs and his ult is a charge the go through walls with a fear added to it
[2:44:46] AinzN: Is Hecarim a Jungler as well?
[2:45:00] Miros__: Jung or top, yeah
[2:45:02] cri_hard: Yeah hes top tier right now
[2:45:46] AinzN: Damn!
[2:46:07] cri_hard: Still, good effort jp Clap
[2:46:28] Lutcha81: his name is "go in with me"
[2:46:31] n1rri: I honestly think that Yasuo had a really rough early, but some of his ults have kept the game going on.
[2:47:06] sin_plague: if you can hit multiple people with pillar and yasuo ults appropriately, you might be able to turn it around
[2:47:09] sack02: might even be baroning
[2:47:15] sin_plague: but at this point the enemy team has twice as much gold as you

[2:48:34] AinzN: I would say worth
[2:48:49] uui23: kept vi busy so she can't steal
[2:49:49] PennyPlaysGames: Noc jumping you was a silly choice
[2:50:16] imsneakle: BORK in trundle is so good
[2:50:21] cri_hard: Winnable Pog
[2:50:24] AinzN: Where's that guy who said he would gift subs if JP wins this game?
[2:50:27] uui23: yeah when noc went for JP instead of MF was a massive missplay since her ult did a lot of damage
[2:50:30] crux_58: This match has many highs and lows
[2:50:40] Mrshilka: @AinzN running
[2:50:51] imsneakle: with elder is def winnable
[2:51:03] AinzN: Mrshilka probably
[2:51:19] cri_hard: @snipinyeti PauseChamp
[2:51:39] CocoScruff: Ziggs Sadge
[2:51:46] Spaltzer: Why did your team choose to engage 4v5 when Ziggs wasn't there?

[2:53:30] AinzN: Trundle's attack speed looks so slow when you don't have the puddle on you
[2:54:07] ritchie313: solo baron there all bot
[2:55:38] AinzN: Team? modCheck
[2:56:12] pa_TIENce: There is no teamwork
[2:56:14] sin_plague: not grouping ever is real frustrating
[2:56:26] noelsixty: @AinzN his attack cancel is kinda insane tho, so many skills he can cancel off
[2:57:00] Thanator: Did MF just return when she could have literally walked to the fountain faster? lmao
[2:57:04] sin_plague: he only has the 1 aa reset skill
[2:57:16] noelsixty: ah, only one. my mistake then
[2:57:25] sin_plague: it does have a relatively low cd though
[2:57:47] sin_plague: you don't have the wards to chase. that's weird
[2:58:08] Lutcha81: i understand why the yasua has that name, he just goes in, no regard for health every time
[2:58:23] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:58:32] TheXemi: yasuo went a little too aggro there
[2:58:33] noelsixty: objective play seems off here, yeah
[2:59:08] ProxyClouds: Damn, why chase and not just kill baron. MF and Yasou are not good
[2:59:29] sin_plague: this game has gone on 15 minutes longer than it should've
[2:59:30] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[3:00:02] noelsixty: inhib time Clap
[3:00:22] CozyBeard: Crazy match, feels like this should have been over 5 times already
[3:00:31] AinzN: I really don't understand League at times
[3:00:34] pa_TIENce: Baron?
[3:00:45] sin_plague: should've probably 2 manned baron on the way out
[3:00:50] Lutcha81: oh ye, where are the timers on the minimap ?
[3:00:59] JWoody82: its a throw off
[3:01:05] Ozoaken: it is frustrating when your team gets two kills for nothing and still refuses to go baron, even one kill is enough to look to baron
[3:01:06] PliusInfo: is this the same game?
[3:01:12] AinzN: Lutcha81 the PC crashed when game loaded up so messed everything up
[3:01:16] Ozoaken: have a lot of games like that
[3:01:18] AinzN: PliusInfo yep
[3:01:19] TDotTerror: Yes. @PliusInfo
[3:01:19] Archangel3003: They are going to try it now for sure
[3:01:22] pa_TIENce: They are doing it now
[3:01:29] Lutcha81: @AinzN oh the timers are from the addon
[3:01:33] crux_58: @PliusInfo yup. timer at the top right
[3:01:35] PliusInfo: oh 42min NotLikeThis
[3:01:40] AinzN: !app Lutcha81
[3:01:40] itmeBOT: @Lutcha81 JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[3:01:49] noelsixty: guy is walking tank jeez
[3:02:02] 0GHammer: you can defend tier 3 turrets
[3:02:05] 0GHammer: you gto this

[3:02:14] n1rri: They don't have the power to push
[3:02:15] iRhayne: oh no JP is back in hell
[3:02:20] ritchie313: rofl they could of ended wtf
[3:02:20] JWoody82: why end when you can throw
[3:02:23] Archangel3003: Why do Yasuo players just play single player cause they're an op champ and think that's enough
[3:02:24] AinzN: iRhayne he never left!
[3:02:25] afreak10: they are scared of u :)
[3:02:28] wbladez: if the dont end, its still winnable
[3:02:31] n1rri: They'll just take baron
[3:02:34] PliusInfo: is opp team trolling at this point? LUL
[3:02:53] Archangel3003: What's even mopre crazy than that is they're not even going Baron
[3:03:12] AinzN: No one likes Baron. He's stinky
[3:03:19] DrYaguar: Pog
[3:03:23] Lutcha81: the timing from MF

[3:04:48] shemg: chains or deadmans
[3:05:00] uui23: did game is still going??
[3:05:02] noelsixty: a match this long reminds me of dota lol
[3:05:07] ProxyClouds: I like Thorne mail but not sure if it’s good for trundle. They focus you a lot in team fight
[3:05:09] sin_plague: they're split both elder and baron
[3:05:11] pa_TIENce: Are the potions still in the game?
[3:05:32] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP Drop Sprite Visage for a Randuin's Omen to stop some of the auto attack damage you take

[3:07:59] Darkaros: ya alistair was just a punching bag LUL
[3:08:00] noelsixty: its weird how some fights Alis is tanking your team for so long their team has problems catching up
[3:08:11] TheZander: if they just grouped...the hell
[3:08:14] DagooX: the tank must have been pissed
[3:08:16] uui23: that was more on twitch not engaging at that last fight
[3:08:16] sin_plague: that twitch lol
[3:08:30] uui23: and when nocturne just blew up mid fight
[3:08:44] noelsixty: the real punching bag right here ijpEZ

[3:09:28] Keyah: Vi had the right of it though, they're full build and half the team is farming
[3:09:28] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP if the tank goes in and no one follows up.. he anit gonna do much
[3:09:29] daz2z: big oof
[3:09:32] TDotTerror: That Alistar's unbelievably tilted.

[3:10:02] RyanSL: he alt f4'd and is going to go play stardew to relax
[3:10:13] Tnobuhiko: @crux_58 it means amount of damage he mitigated, if you deal 100 damage and if he mitigates 80 you deal 20 damage to hi
[3:10:23] Irvatar: it looks like they lost because twitch didn't deal damage when he should
[3:10:25] crux_58: @crux_58 gotcha ty
[3:10:28] AinzN: Jammies
[3:10:34] Mondo_Gibbs: 2
[3:11:04] Keyah: Twitch was full build and still farming instead of being in Teamfights cirLaugh
[3:11:10] Tnobuhiko: yeah he should just wait for yasuo wall then open up with ult
[3:11:15] Mondo_Gibbs: @itmeJP if you like to run down people and doing jump scares on people try out Hecarim - he is super fast
[3:11:37] ProxyClouds: Both twitch and nocturne keep showing up late. So almost all team fights started 3v5 we’re JPs team nuked Alistar or got a pick

[3:50:12] Ozoaken: ya yasuo ult keeps you in place so you have no chance to dodge diana ult
[3:50:37] Darkaros: JP decided not to play Weird West because it was unvoiced
[3:50:41] Keyah: "ward"
[3:50:41] saiB_1912: a ward skin

[3:53:33] br4nd0nh347: THe more people around her the more damage
[3:53:47] RhylerH: Her ult does more damage the more people she pulls in, that plus yasuo ult crit just melted your team
[3:53:47] TheObliviousYeti: Focusing tank ^^
[3:53:48] br4nd0nh347: whoa look at those wins
[3:53:55] Ribbons_Almark: She can just Dash and E to summon Yasuo like a Pokémon
[3:54:15] TheObliviousYeti: big juicy tanks feel so nice though
[3:54:25] privatememes_: yeah but still ult the tanks if playing trundle
[3:54:31] InsidiousKettle: Yeah, just ult tanks and go after their backline

[3:56:48] privatememes_: idk about this cleanse lol
[3:56:54] Lunar688: yeah, but he needs to cheese a lvl 2 gank
[3:56:55] stoiink: annoying well
[3:57:01] Lunar688: which is about 99% effective at low elo
[3:57:01] xyzlime: pretty strong in the rite hands
[3:57:06] RhylerH: Their team so squish against your team's wombo
[3:57:12] garry_leonard: He will struggle if you suceed at invading or killing him early
[3:57:35] RhylerH: Not alot of cc on them either, all damage or bust
[3:59:33] Lunar688: go steal his blue!
[3:59:36] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour.

Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[3:59:50] Lunar688: He's blue and gromp are up to steal. it'll put him behind and you ahead
[4:00:35] Lunar688: his*
[4:02:49] Lunar688: steal his chickens and golems there, since he just showed top and you were in his jungle already.
[4:02:59] vangardart: go next
[4:03:16] RhylerH: Yeah against a gank heavy jungler like twitch you can just stack objectives or predict a counter gank
[4:03:23] Lunar688: if you see the enemy jungler on the opposite side of the map as you ganking then it's better to take his jungle than your own

[4:14:20] Gameofpwns16: The important thing is that it has like an 8-10s cooldown, so if you wait it out and then go in he's much easier to take on
[4:14:50] RhylerH: This team is actually pretty good despite falling behind early
[4:14:57] Gameofpwns16: @itmeJP you're doing a great job with objective control so far
[4:16:29] novorus92: how are you finding jungle
[4:16:34] Fairshihtzu: Stream stuttering some, or just me?

[4:17:40] lentyla: you should really start maxing out your W instead of your Q

[4:17:43] CupCakesofChaos: jp learning that jgl life
[4:18:24] vangardart: needed a better choice of support tbh
[4:18:31] Gameofpwns16: See? Jax's dodge was on cd so you were able to bonk him
[4:18:50] Miros__: So... a fiddle
[4:19:23] afreak10: either dragon or baron now
[4:19:27] GambolMuse: Fiddle support, huh? Bold choice
[4:19:35] BroqRox: lol that arrow
[4:19:43] afreak10: F
[4:19:55] novorus92: very hard trundle game, but game isnt on you

[4:21:56] InternetPlumber: should steal the role queue from dota
[4:22:01] RhylerH: They tried, it wasnt good
[4:22:07] novorus92: what made you whanna jungle? trying all roles? or
[4:22:13] Kabora: Can we arrest them for being such criminal scum?
[4:22:16] RhylerH: People manipulating the system
[4:22:21] Cronopolis: It failed because many high elo people complained that when people were "filled" in off roles, they played less tryhard
[4:22:29] novorus92: jungles real fun, for solo i like it alot
[4:22:48] RhylerH: LUL good quesiton
[4:22:50] br4nd0nh347: $$$$$$$$$
[4:22:57] Keyah: Funny enough it's not in their interest to ban players
[4:23:05] xyzlime: Because riot doesn’t ban lol
[4:23:10] xyzlime: They never do
[4:23:11] GambolMuse: Or if you queue into a certain role, make it so your champ select is only that role specifric
[4:23:11] novorus92: riot does ban
[4:23:14] novorus92: so thats a lie
[4:23:17] GambolMuse: Specific*

[4:23:24] Ribbons_Almark: do it, get banned Kappa
[4:23:31] xyzlime: @grifff93 u be surprised
[4:23:40] vangardart: kench
[4:23:40] LovesCatSweater: try zac
[4:23:41] novorus92: i know for a fact they do lol
[4:23:41] Gameofpwns16: I like nocturne jg
[4:23:59] xyzlime: I mean they do but lightly
[4:24:01] Gameofpwns16: JP, you're making too much sense
[4:24:03] InternetPlumber: too much logic in that
[4:24:05] br4nd0nh347: Those that get banend make new accounts anyways
[4:24:07] LovesCatSweater: will pay for ban
[4:24:14] jmanrme: Part of the problem is the perception about riot not banning so people don't report
[4:24:26] Victo0: but this would mean that people can be happy, i played LoL for over a decade and i'm pretty sure happy people are just a myth
[4:24:27] Khuja__: maybe I am missing something, but if there was a role specific queue, what exactly can people manipluate?
[4:24:29] shemg: also the banned people will probably make a new account and spend money
[4:24:42] BroqRox: harware ban?
[4:24:46] br4nd0nh347: @Green_Chocobo they swap their role with someone else
[4:24:52] novorus92: its also bad because the face of league of legends is the most tosix person ever it shows people they can be to
[4:25:04] Khuja__: surely if you don't do your role, you get reported and banned though
[4:25:06] Gameofpwns16: IP ban might work. Wonder how that would go over with players though.
[4:25:08] BroqRox: lol
[4:25:09] RhylerH: Bans only really happen from hate speech and text cause there are too many ban reports so they automate the system and that system is so poor
[4:25:14] Archangel3003: But they make a new account and have to get back to lvl30 with a handful of champs to even get into ranked. That might put them off getting banned a bunch as well
[4:25:14] Felgrun: But we're on fuckin silver so nothing matters
[4:25:23] novorus92: i love watching him too
[4:25:24] br4nd0nh347: @Green_Chocobo surely luxxLaugh
[4:25:27] Victo0: @itmeJP also one role/queue meant that midlaner would have 50 min queues
[4:25:40] Klaag: @itmeJP ipban can be worked around man, better to do mac ban
[4:25:42] BroqRox: I remember when my friends and I went all tanks in lol KEKW
[4:25:47] Keyah: Mid is most pop. yeah
[4:25:50] Cronopolis: Malphite probably wants to blow people up LUL
[4:25:54] br4nd0nh347: Oh yeah that was a problem too queue times
[4:25:54] GambolMuse: I hate mid, give my support/jungle any day
[4:26:00] Gameofpwns16: @Victo0 This is a feature, not a bug. Forces players to diversify their roles.
[4:26:21] Gameofpwns16: Or they can sit in a long queue
[4:26:22] RhylerH: Ap burst malp and bruiser yorick so really only two tanks tbh
[4:26:22] br4nd0nh347: I actually liked that idea, but yeah it didn't work.
[4:26:27] vangardart: is league in a tank meta right now
[4:26:36] Victo0: @itmeJP before all that we had no role, 99% of the time the person that had to support was just the last person to selct their champion that got forced into support

[4:29:01] Gameofpwns16: @Karigard Amumu has a gap closer that allows him to get in close combat with enemies. Then he pops a bunch of AOE damage (and CC on his ult). Generally builds tanky, sometimes with some magic damage.
