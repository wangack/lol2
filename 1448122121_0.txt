[1:01:36] NinjaPandaEU: If I had money I'd own so many keyboards lmao
[1:01:37] NiceGuyNick: @itmeJP Yea dude this is the step ive never took
[1:01:37] Gorn_Vernaleer: way too expensive...
[1:01:38] Vaylufa: oh man i really wanna build one myself with those real nice clicky clicks
[1:01:39] Vuhadzu: it's a fun way to spend a lot of money
[1:01:39] alonzogarbanzo: it's all about the lubing
[1:01:40] BlazeRom: Kreygasm
[1:01:41] Javtastrophe: same
[1:01:42] bansheehero: this one is pretty mild when it comes to customs
[1:01:42] MMOAltoholic: @itmeJP you should it's amazing
[1:01:43] noelsixty: i went cheap with Keychron but its so nice once you dip a toe into it LUL
[1:01:44] Neragsito: it's a DEEP rabbit hole
[1:01:44] 00oniking00: @EightBitDelight in brazil all that is build on MDF and some parts with MDP
[1:01:44] MiniMofu: I never see the appeal of those curly cables
[1:01:44] AN71V1RU5: i just started getting into it a bit. don't, its an absolute money pit
[1:01:45] ElSpartin: yeah i just want a keyboard that is good and ready to go
[1:01:46] Xorkrik: Then you have to lube them LUL
[1:01:47] thanh_n2004: it's very satisfying to type on them
[1:01:47] BlazeRom: I can see the appeal
[1:01:48] ItsNoxid: i know its a money sink so i stayed away
[1:01:48] cromxa: my friend does it and makes a new keyboard like once every 3 months lol
[1:01:50] Saryuken: Its with hotswappable switches YUCK
[1:01:50] RuleofBooKz: keyboard front is too high and square
[1:01:51] Darkaros: cattu
[1:01:52] BarryCarlyon: Nice pause
[1:01:53] Dieelon: its for coders that wear north face vests
[1:01:53] MagnaCarter_: great pause JP
[1:01:54] Hemry64_: There so much going on here KEKW
[1:01:55] freedout: i dont think you can build a PC cheaper than the brand names.
[1:01:56] swinglock: I like the cat LUL
[1:01:57] xarantur: don't get into the keyboard building cause it often turns into an addiction
[1:01:57] BlazeRom: NODDERS
[1:01:58] Ciefon: yes
[1:01:58] noelsixty: yes KEKW
[1:01:58] KelticNight: "some assembly required" LUL

[1:02:02] its__fil: You can get more custom than this, but yes
[1:02:04] MiniMofu: Gotta lube t hem too
[1:02:05] Vuhadzu: yep
[1:02:05] Sprengkobold: yeah cause you can customize the switches
[1:02:05] ace_korneya: you constomize it the way you want the the point of it @itmeJP
[1:02:06] ElSpartin: not worth
[1:02:06] Xorkrik: keycap
[1:02:06] IssacMc: do you want to spend more money to build it yourself?
[1:02:08] Marzus: you can also fuck it up
[1:02:08] SuperToxin: seems like a huge waste of time
[1:02:08] ChiZWorkshop: I don't know why this video is stressing me out
[1:02:09] boxofpants: cause marketing
[1:02:09] TheFall3n: Customization
[1:02:09] Anjaku: well the switch u like
[1:02:09] BlazeRom: it's fun
[1:02:09] JessicaSong: its called building JP
[1:02:10] noelsixty: its like building a warhammer KEKW
[1:02:10] zerohour_88: ew, manual labor
[1:02:11] Shoaron: people want their custom keys bruh
[1:02:11] bansheehero: well no
[1:02:11] Zandivya: The Dark Souls keyboard Noor linked looked pretty cool
[1:02:12] ToeKnee147: you have to BUY the switches and caps
[1:02:12] its__fil: Why do you build custom PCs
[1:02:12] xarantur: and lube them up JP
[1:02:13] Vuhadzu: fun and customisation
[1:02:13] Theagent203: @itmeJP so you can have the base that you want and the switches that you want
[1:02:14] moist_heinous: so it sounds and feels better
[1:02:14] SixPointFive: So you have have the switches you want?
[1:02:15] the_real_beardcat: you can have different switches for different keys
[1:02:15] alonzogarbanzo: Why do people like legos?
[1:02:15] SZebra: Different switches have different feels, so you can customise it  perfectly
[1:02:15] yrvengalied: but the cat though
[1:02:15] thanh_n2004: i mean same reason you build a PC i'd gather
[1:02:17] espi: same reason you build a PC yourself: to get to choose everything
[1:02:17] streamChef: If you do a lot of typing getting an ergonomic one is 100% worth it.
[1:02:17] 667_warwolf: Custom switches in custom places
[1:02:17] tecwa: clicking a keyboard together is so zen
[1:02:17] dreddreplicant: no thanks
[1:02:17] TheFall3n: DIY
[1:02:18] Ravnim: this is the easier set up LUL
[1:02:20] Notenoughcoffee: and sometimes you have to lube them aswell
[1:02:20] copycoffeecat: custom key caps
[1:02:20] zahal3x: ikea of keyboards
[1:02:20] PliusInfo: KEKW
[1:02:21] EightBitDelight: @00oniking00 Same here. But when I live in BC, they built everything to last
[1:02:21] chazlupine: because it cost more Kappa
[1:02:21] Kaleith: you can also use lube, o-rings and more
[1:02:21] NinjaPandaEU: Because you can choose from a hundred different switches.
[1:02:21] Hemry64_: A lot of people learn to solder to make their keyboard
[1:02:21] Javtastrophe: its some elitist shit
[1:02:21] IceReaper898: So you can use your own preference of switches, and customize stabilizers
[1:02:21] AN71V1RU5: you can get way more custom than that, but yeah, thats the idea
[1:02:22] Anjaku: custom switches with different click sounds
[1:02:23] Senpai_Eeyore: I literally used my stimulus check to buy a moonlander (which is a split ortho keyboard)
[1:02:24] CyberLetho: Its a waste of time
[1:02:24] KerwinBJones: you can have different switches for different keys
[1:02:25] LeelandGrant: so you can use different switches for differnet keys LUL
[1:02:27] ausl0: opening up and lubing each switch makes a huge difference
[1:02:27] Zuleyus: your 3090 would pay for a lot less keyboards than you'd expect... LUL
[1:02:28] Ciefon: because you want very particular switches
[1:02:28] TheFall3n: I want to do it myself
[1:02:28] MrTengan: more shit that you can break installing it
[1:02:29] teh_PING: look sound and feel
[1:02:30] Xorkrik: So that you can get the switches you want and the keycaps you want.
[1:02:31] AN71V1RU5: to tailor it exactly to your needs
[1:02:31] ワフルデラ: you can make a very silent keyboard when made custom
[1:02:32] DingoOnMy40: DIY
[1:02:32] espi: @itmeJP some shops assemble it for you
[1:02:32] rich16bit: some people are really into it as a zen thing
[1:02:33] BarryCarlyon: in case you want different switches in different places and want to change it later I geuss
[1:02:33] CocoScruff: because they can
[1:02:35] noelsixty: its a hobby
[1:02:35] the_real_beardcat: its like a puzzle
[1:02:35] MMOAltoholic: you can swap the switches for different keys and change them when they burn out
[1:02:36] ElSpartin: Cant you just tell the company "hey I want x swtiches on y keys" ?
[1:02:36] AinzN: Where's Noor? Maybe she can explain properly
[1:02:37] ace_korneya: better quiality stuff too is like building your own pc samething @itmeJP
[1:02:37] Shoaron: easier to repair
[1:02:37] leovic1: mostly to keep in theme with the rest of the build
[1:02:38] SZebra: @Senpai_Eeyore Clap
[1:02:39] ashla11: so you can choose what kind of keycaps and switches you want and the company doesnt charge you?
[1:02:39] 667_warwolf: @itmeJP Diffrent key-switches on diffrent keys
[1:02:40] bansheehero: you get it assembled ot you buy fro, other sources
[1:02:40] KelticNight: people are weird NODDERS
[1:02:41] gseeder: so u can swap them out whenever u want cuz thats what being a crazy is about
[1:02:41] mfmotion: you can have different types of key switches I guess
[1:02:41] SirJaswic: because once you type on a nice switch, everything else feels like hot garbage
[1:02:41] Vandellyr: I bet they paid more for the DIY... LUL
[1:02:42] MagnaCarter_: Why do you have shelves of things behind you JP? How many did you build?
[1:02:42] Rambler: cause custom switches are so much better than the ones in prebuilts
[1:02:42] HadieHim: the people that do that also do it for multiple keyboards to collect them
[1:02:42] WDForty: for ppl who want to use custom switches, some ppl will use different switches for letters vs function keys, etc.
[1:02:44] MrDigitalCypher: like how many social gatherings do you have in your office>?
[1:02:47] conv3rge_: Once you start typing on better switches, you'll never be able to go back.
[1:02:48] dreddreplicant: LUL
[1:02:48] CanadianEevee: My needs is a keyboard
[1:02:49] Anjaku: custom click sounds
[1:02:49] Shinichii: Looks cool though
[1:02:50] Vuhadzu: so you can use whatever switches in the keyboard case
[1:02:51] KingRahe: custom keyboards are serious business
[1:02:51] BlazeRom: it needs to look pretty ijpMAD
[1:02:52] noelsixty: not for them keebs enjoyer LUL

[1:02:54] uzling: more whiskey for me... that keyboard makes no sens... more booze 4 me LUL
[1:02:55] Ciefon: people are very particular about how their keyboards look and feel

[1:02:59] Hemry64_: He doesn't get it NOPERS
[1:02:59] DrTazerFace: Pc ppl are a special and unique breed. So they need everything “special and unique”

[1:03:07] Vaylufa: and some want really small cool custom ones with nice keys?
[1:03:07] Xaamatu: people like to use different switches, some keyboards give many switches
[1:03:08] Saxmachine904: There is no defending this lol
[1:03:08] MMOAltoholic: it's a "feel" thing
[1:03:08] cromxa: can make it looks cool and feel better i guess

[1:03:17] techjunkie452: some people like building cars, others build pc's and the crazy ones build keyboards

[1:03:18] PliusInfo: KEKW
[1:03:18] MrDigitalCypher: dumbest
[1:03:19] Senpai_Eeyore: I mean its like anything, its a hobby

[1:03:40] Miros__: @yrvengalied The moon isn't real.

[1:04:27] LeelandGrant: there is only one way to sleep LUL
[1:04:28] leovic1: HACKERMANS
[1:04:28] conv3rge_: You absolutely will type better.

[1:04:30] bansheehero: There 3 reasons: Sound, Controller and ergonomics
[1:04:30] Miros__: I type with my penis
[1:04:30] SZebra: Hear that chat, membrane switches for everyone!
[1:04:31] xystus_: different switches have different action points.
[1:04:33] MrDigitalCypher: Becuase AmERICa
[1:04:33] TheFall3n: The height of the cap helps to type faster
[1:04:33] Riluske: It's fun
[1:04:33] espi: JP LUL
[1:04:34] Kaleith: I think it's more like custom tailored clothes, store-bought are fine but getting something that fits you perfectly is another world
[1:04:34] Vuhadzu: it changes/improves/worsens your typing depending on the switches
[1:04:36] IssacMc: but people love to hear about your custom keyboard at parties
[1:04:37] KelticNight: even if you get an expensive keyboard, why can't it come pre-assembled? LUL
[1:04:38] Hemry64_: Linus has videos on this I believe PepeLaugh
[1:04:38] Dieelon: its for "coders" that wear north face vests

[1:04:44] tphuman: @itmeJP great marketing from custom keyboard companies
[1:04:44] DCHenkels: To brag and show off
[1:04:45] SchnellBier: my 10€ keyboard does the job KEKW
[1:04:46] Theagent203: @itmeJP why buy a lambo if you can only drive 50 in cities
[1:04:46] LiteralZero: WTFF chat
[1:04:47] CruncheeSnacks: he isn't being critical of expensive keyboard.. more than you have to assemble it... you can buy fully functional keyboards with blue switches
[1:04:47] MrTengan: bragging rights...
[1:04:47] pa_TIENce: we need Noot
[1:04:48] Woolfius_: no it doesnt KEKW

[1:04:48] SZebra: Also true
[1:04:49] hekehe: Its hobby! get over it
[1:04:49] its__fil: You can program custom keyboards pretty nicely with layers, macros and so on. More so than Logitech/Corsair/Razer software etc
[1:04:50] unsimulacrum: @itmeJP it's just a hobby kind of a thing, people make a big deal out of it.
[1:04:50] pa_TIENce: Noor
[1:04:51] EightBitDelight: It's fun to DIY stuff to learn how they work

[1:04:55] GTrakl: It's just cool to build the stuff that you're gonna use? I don't know sofieShrug
[1:04:56] domTheCactus: lego one was pretty good explanation, why do you like to build lego instead of buying already built lego statues
[1:04:56] the_real_beardcat: you should buy a key-test-kit
[1:04:57] Zandivya: Spend money on anything between your fingers and the table ramaLul
[1:04:57] DrTazerFace: BUT BUT BUT is the only explanation

[1:05:00] Arosa2D: it's like buying skins (?)
[1:05:01] arctura_alpha: your bank balance will thank you for not getting into custom keyboards @itmeJP
[1:05:01] alonzogarbanzo: Imagine not understanding keyboard culture KEKW
[1:05:03] thrillhouse451: Maybe they like the way it looks
[1:05:03] Kercon: We have money and we want to spend it
[1:05:04] WDPrescott_: if you want to type better you get an ergonomic keyboard, though they are monstrous
[1:05:05] ToeKnee147: only argument i could make would be spacing @itmeJP
[1:05:05] Alrric: I dont think there is a explenation its just pawning off the work to those who want to pay more lol
[1:05:05] SmoothAssKiwi: we've got some stenographers in chat i see
[1:05:05] NinjaPandaEU: I type better on MX blue than on red or black e.g.
[1:05:06] Saryuken: I do it because I can afford it. And it looks nice
[1:05:07] srslypls: customize feel and sound to your liking
[1:05:08] ワフルデラ: you can make more silent keyboards when built custom @itmeJP
[1:05:09] MMOAltoholic: what keyboard are you using now @itmeJP
[1:05:09] Senpai_Eeyore: the only real reason is that people like it and thats it, there doesnt need to be an explanation
[1:05:11] Sprengkobold: are you really gonna use the player 3 keyboard
[1:05:16] thatoneguysky: Because it was free
[1:05:16] oaktree3: give it a try. JP XD
[1:05:16] noelsixty: my keyboard has a knob LUL
[1:05:17] ace_korneya: well yeah you can have a 3090 doest mean your better at games is just like building you pc you get to customize every aspect of the keyboard to your liking
[1:05:18] Woolfius_: if you trip over the keys when typing on a 10 dollar KB you will do the same on a 500dollar KB
[1:05:19] Mallatom: widepeepoHappy Kitten
[1:05:20] 667_warwolf: ok its like diffrent condoms, some just feel better...
[1:05:21] Icemoth: sound + the tactile feel + you actually type faster on some switches
[1:05:22] LordCogency: Its so  you can customize each section of the keyboard. Like WASD a different tactile thingie and whatnot.
[1:05:22] Teza_Kinoku: because people want to customize everything they own to their own aesthetics
[1:05:22] LeelandGrant: @itmeJP you can use different switches for different keys e.g. WASD
[1:05:22] NiceGuyNick: @itmeJP I SEE YOU JUDGING US ALL LIKE A GOD
[1:05:23] almoexe: its like the weight of a good knife, everyone has preferences
[1:05:24] KelticNight: LUL
[1:05:25] EightBitDelight: That cat looks comfy
[1:05:26] WDForty: @itmeJP different switches have different key height, different weights for actuation, some require linear force, some require more force to get past a "switching point"
[1:05:26] AN71V1RU5: different switch actuation points can defintiely affect typing speed, but tbf you can buy premade keyboards with almost any switch types
[1:05:27] KerwinBJones: if linus made a video about building your own keyboard he'd drink the koolaid
[1:05:27] DrTazerFace: @waffledealerwastaken that I can appreciate and understand

[1:05:35] AporieTM: imho such keyboards only help people who grew up learning typing with typewriters or old, hard keyboards.
[1:05:39] aki_mattis: you'd be the bestest typer in the world
[1:05:39] Imbadyoureworse: @itmejp my cherry red switches sound nice and feel nice when I’m coding for hours on end. That’s basically why I like them
[1:05:40] Darkaros: woah espi got weirdly censored wonder why
[1:05:44] yrvengalied: ijpKEK
[1:05:44] PunyMagus: sometimes it helps depending on the person. Some people type moving the fingers higher/lower and the position of the keys can feel either good or bad depending on the keyboard
[1:05:47] yrvengalied: all the Jinxes
[1:05:47] Xorkrik: It's totally not gonna start now.

[1:07:56] TPLivewire: Yeah that cable is ugly
[1:08:00] PunyMagus: the loud keyboard is fun at the beginning, but it gets bad when you have to code til 4am and keep the neighbours awake with you

[1:08:05] bansheehero: That I dont know.. those 50 bucks cavles are so popular
[1:08:08] Rambler: steadycam
[1:08:09] its__fil: What are your thoughts on RGB lighting in computers?
[1:08:09] streamChef: Cable is 100% dumb and only for aesthetic reasons
[1:08:13] AN71V1RU5: its a rig to take the weight off, helps keep stable and mitigate back issues
[1:08:14] Elievex: Those a classic old school keyboard cable
