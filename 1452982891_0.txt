[0:24:43] WDForty: he teleported Hulk with his dying breath
[0:24:44] ThemDemo: Skurge?
[0:24:49] prfella: heimdall Sadge
[0:24:49] BigWaldo7713: skurge ya
[0:24:50] yrvengalied: Time for a New Asgard ?
[0:25:03] ThemDemo: He sacrificed himself I think
[0:25:04] raptorscream: will we get Ares from WW? :))
[0:25:08] ruiyolas: knuckles Sadge
[0:25:10] Wubsian: @Deadpixzl Loki die died not Snap Died
[0:25:10] A1rbanas: @itmeJP one of the most important aspects of the mcu that I have noticed so far is that there needs to be body confirmation, if there's no body confirmation they have a chance to comeback someway
[0:25:15] Hundisilm: Isn't new Asgard Norway?
[0:25:23] EvilBuho: I think Thor gets kill
[0:25:27] Shin_gx: @Malanor85 yeah i get that LUL we see her in endgame too for a bit in the time travel bit
[0:25:28] prfella: @deadpixzl no Prime Loki is dead. variant loki is in another timeline in the TVA base
[0:25:29] WDForty: the end of the Lady Thor comic arc crated a new Asgard in space
[0:25:30] rich16bit: Egyptian Gods?
[0:25:32] Sir_Myrmidon: It's SG-1, Thor's race wanders off and earth is left to defend itself vs the other 'gods' :)
[0:25:33] 23Thijs: what if russel crowe isn't playing zeus but instead old Thor
[0:25:39] 00oniking00: i hope not
[0:25:40] Tyronin: she'll find a piece of the hammer, it's the same way Frog Thor happened
[0:25:41] Shin_gx: Meow meow lionStop zekeHAM
[0:25:47] Deadpixzl: @Wubsian ahh right
[0:25:51] Legionnare92: MYAAA nir
[0:25:55] Ogrekidd: The real question is are they gonna have thor ride a space shark like in the comic
[0:26:01] Siggenlh: Mjølner
[0:26:06] Xanctius: @itmeJP But in Ragnarok, it is said that the hammer isnt the source of thors power, so that makes no sense
[0:26:14] Hundisilm: No
[0:26:15] Sonatta: no... multiverse ends in Strange
[0:26:17] Wholemane: That would be horrible. Cpt marvel levels bad LUL
[0:26:21] 00_Exia94: end credit maybe
[0:26:21] Malanor85: post credit mabye
[0:26:22] thekingofthewolf1: women power
[0:26:23] Sir_Myrmidon: after-credits ?
[0:26:24] OmarKhaledBadr: He still has to deal with Kang though
[0:26:30] goblinlove: That would be cool
[0:26:37] rich16bit: maybe end credits
[0:26:45] raptorscream: Mjolnir, or how Ant-Man calls it... Johnathan
[0:26:48] Siggenlh: we already have female asgardian in the MCU or is Valkyrie difrent. since she aint a Thor.
[0:26:49] KatjeMauw: hiddle boy cant kee p a secret can he?
[0:26:56] Ogrekidd: the gorr comic has like time travel different ages of the same thor
[0:27:01] WDForty: i think Multiverse of Madness is going to change something in the MCU that we will see partly in the Thor movie
[0:27:01] goblinlove: Loki could be hiding himeself
[0:27:03] davidonstreet: hey anyone else having probelms finding the vod for the stream? it has happended for every channel today
[0:27:14] davidonstreet: cant watch back untill streams over
[0:27:16] DrTazerFace: @xanctius but Odin blessed it to give whoever is worthy the power of Thor. Even if it isn’t The source it Can be
[0:27:19] raptorscream: @Siggenlh she;s a Valkyrie, not a God or "worthy"
[0:27:19] goblinlove: King Valkyrie will die
[0:27:22] WDForty: i can see Loki for post credits
[0:27:28] dahak777: @davidonstreet Twitch has done some new dmca so alot of them get unpublished
[0:27:33] jeffhunter12: yeah montage for sure
[0:27:33] prfella: @siggenlh female asgardian role is the brunette one from the movie and loki show
[0:27:34] Sonatta: definitely a work out montage
[0:27:35] andaroo: montage hypeE
[0:27:42] BigWaldo7713: even rocky had a montage!
[0:27:44] 00_Exia94: training montage Pog
[0:27:46] LFC_Letters: thatll be the title scene probably
[0:27:47] AinzN: "Push it too the limit!" Jammies
[0:27:48] LiamLee_iii: When does Beta Ray Bill come into the picture?
[0:27:52] ThemDemo: That's probly the opening credits LUL
[0:27:58] prfella: @siggenlh forgot her name, lady somemthing, shes in love with thor
[0:28:01] Zrmi: Hes gonna play Wii Fit now
[0:28:06] DrTazerFace: Beta Ray would be an awesome surprise
[0:28:11] andaroo: Would be cool if Thor and the Ravagers were out keeping peace and helping in space
[0:28:14] WDForty: oh shit, my idea for Thor post credit, is Loki showing up on the run from the new TVA to warn ppl about Kang????
[0:28:19] OmarKhaledBadr: Thanos killed half of all those refugees before he snapped them too
[0:28:21] Siggenlh: aint Valkyrie running new asgard?
[0:28:22] Tyronin: i bet you she doesn't even rebuild it, it will form on it's own
[0:28:36] prfella: @siggenlh yea she is
[0:28:48] Tyronin: she'll find a piece of it, it's how frog thor became thor, he found a piece of the shattered hammer
[0:28:49] Redvelvet84: why rebuild, isnt there an extrra hammer after endgame? Nowhere was stated that was returned
[0:28:51] goblinlove: Release date?
[0:28:53] Ravnim: ooo, does jane get snapped
[0:28:55] Zrmi: I think something will happen to Thor and she will need to repair the hammer to save gim
[0:28:58] Incredible_Sausage: franchise toy cycles always ruin movies
[0:29:05] andaroo: It's in early poster art, so probably not
[0:29:14] ThemDemo: Well they announced it at comic con and it was pretty big press
[0:29:15] Deleroth: @Tyronin do you have to be worthy to lift a piece?
[0:29:16] EvilBuho: She did
[0:29:18] Barrh: cap took the hammer back as well @Redvelvet84
[0:29:18] WDForty: they announced Lady Thor when they announced the movie
[0:29:19] GrakusWolf: Maybe sword tries to rebuild the hammer and she is brought in as an expert on Thor and proves to be worthy to wield it
[0:29:22] LFC_Letters: its in posters and toys... its announced
[0:29:30] Crafteroon: It's a Taika film, Gorr comes to kill the Asgardians, instead kills the Asgardian actors of Loki, Odin and Hela, Matt Damon, Sam Neill and Melissa McCarthy.
[0:29:40] Siggenlh: marvel changes their stuff all the way till release and sometimes after it LUL
[0:29:41] Tyronin: @Deleroth no, but it will only form the full hammer and give you power if youa re
[0:29:45] raptorscream: they did it once, wit hSteve
[0:29:45] DrTazerFace: Yea lady Thor has been confirmed for quite awhile
[0:29:49] everyhoohoo: i can't wait to see her muscles :)
[0:29:49] raptorscream: they wont take that from him
[0:29:59] 00_Exia94: KEKW
[0:30:02] GregoryGlen: KEKW

[0:30:10] ghostsofcarcosa: They gots to go
[0:30:16] Munetani_NJimha: That would totally be Waititi LUL
[0:30:20] Malanor85: Maaaatt dAEEamonn
[0:30:24] andaroo: I think this film is going to be darker than Ragnarok (which was actually pretty dark)
[0:30:27] Hundisilm: It is still weird for me to call someone "Thor" - Thor is not a super hero identity to me but a person :)
[0:30:29] ThemDemo: Rumors are that a test screening happened recently internally and people gave it a standing ovation.
[0:30:34] andaroo: Russell Crowe is Zeus
[0:30:44] Zaelsus: It could be a cut away scene after Gor finds the actors, thinking they're the real ones
[0:30:52] prfella: yea russell crowe is zeus and melissa mcarthy is hela
[0:30:56] WayneG947: I think something like that is going to happen from the rumours i hear
[0:31:03] raptorscream: its a toy
[0:31:27] raptorscream: https://geekositymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/See-Christain-Bales-Gorr-in-the-upcoming-Thor-Love-and-Thunder-01-768x402.jpg
[0:31:30] EvilBuho: I think Ravager Thor dies in the first 15 minutes of the movie, then craziness ensue to find a way to revive thor and that is how the hammer gets rebuilt.
[0:31:30] TheRhymenoceros: Russell Crowe Zeus is in the audience watching the actor playing him get slaughtered by Gorr
[0:31:31] pc2400: @prfella hela variant?
[0:31:32] raptorscream: this is what he is talking about
[0:31:39] 00_Exia94: KEKW
[0:31:40] WDForty: it was shit manderain

[0:31:44] Incredible_Sausage: That's a HQ cosplay
[0:31:47] bakavic: can confirm, can barely understand it
[0:31:54] El_Zilcho22: yeah that was bad hahaha
[0:31:59] BigWaldo7713: its actual gibberish
[0:32:02] lixyewup: I couldn't even tell it was a real language.
[0:32:04] prfella: @stalker2400 nah shes plays hela in the stage show llike Matt damon is loki
[0:32:08] nicklepolaroid: Why do they try with mandarin? stripDerp
[0:32:12] khascien: Yea it sounded really questionable
[0:32:14] ghostsofcarcosa: Yea it did sound off
[0:32:14] nicklepolaroid: Just do Spanish or something
[0:32:15] WDForty: everything is slurred together with horrible prounouciation
[0:32:16] Ceaseless_: did you see bale on set @itmeJP https://old.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/u0gfen/christian_bale_as_gorr_the_god_butcher_bts_pics/
[0:32:16] toaobadger: LUL LUL LUL yeah it sounded bad
[0:32:18] shadowoflight_: it was rubbish
[0:32:18] taolander: yep native speaker here, couldn't understand anything
[0:32:22] Tyronin: awwwww
[0:32:24] leovic1: ijpHI

[0:32:40] Gundevil: Yeah thought they were saying something in egyptian at first
[0:32:42] pc2400: @prfella that'd be funny
[0:32:43] Hundisilm: That is very weird
[0:32:46] Zrmi: maybe its one of those intentional mistakes Kappa
[0:32:48] WayneG947: probably because of the pitch of the vocals
[0:33:05] Redvelvet84: you'd think it be easy for them to get proper trainers after Shang-Chi
[0:33:07] Tr0nc3k: second ep sucks tho
[0:33:07] prfella: @stalker2400 oh its confirmed already
[0:33:09] Tyronin: YYYAAASSSS
[0:33:09] andaroo: I mean Oscar was in his undies
[0:33:11] ThemDemo: Went from a 9 to a 9.5
[0:33:12] Deleroth: mr knight did it for her
[0:33:12] Xanctius: I found it super boring
[0:33:14] gorlork: POGGIES
[0:33:15] Tyronin: it was so good
[0:33:16] ThatGunsFoHire: The suit easily bumped it up to a 9
[0:33:16] poooookey: spoiler tags?
[0:33:16] BlueSapphyre: i didn't like the second episode as much..
[0:33:16] Legionnare92: new strange trailer no?
[0:33:17] JosieSprings: Yes!
[0:33:17] Ceaseless_: why is she so loud lol
[0:33:20] PrimordialDilemma: What?
[0:33:22] SpaceDive: well.........
[0:33:25] Zeinternetz: Super wrong
[0:33:27] Zrmi: It was better but still kinda crap
[0:33:28] porpoise42: lol i had a hunch bronze would like this episode
[0:33:29] Siggenlh: they are running out of time with the show imo
[0:33:34] Incredible_Sausage: did we watch the same thing?
[0:33:35] andaroo: That is one of the best tailored suits
[0:33:36] FrozanFlames: NODDERS I think they should have released 1 and 2 as 1 episodes 2 was so much better
[0:33:37] BlueSpringFM: 'Wagwan, I did it!'
[0:33:37] Tyronin: It was so good, chat is wild
[0:33:38] kingofgames726: broze please use your inside voice unleess that is her inside voice
[0:33:41] quaxim: @itmeJP can you throw up the "now discussing"
[0:33:42] raptorscream: they did it with Loki
[0:33:45] SpaceDive: big cliffhanger I bet
[0:34:24] Incredible_Sausage: episode 2 had the same story beats as episode 1
[0:34:26] Zrmi: the CGI still horrible
[0:34:29] GoDoWaR: @itmeJP they appearently did the cuts in the first eoisode for the rating so its all the violent scenes
[0:34:30] Shin_gx: KEKW
[0:34:30] Hobolito90: what are we talking about? moon knight?
[0:34:32] Monchenjiners23: KEKW
[0:34:40] n1rri: @Hobolito90 We are
[0:34:47] gorlork: I liked the second episode
[0:34:48] toaobadger: episode 1 was just for the layman fans who needed a mundane introduction to the character
[0:34:51] SabertoothEwok: Playing Mr Knight off as a joke sucked…
[0:34:53] Siggenlh: im happy they refrained so far with flashbacks. keep the show going forward
[0:35:00] Legionnare92: different directors btwn ep1 and 2
[0:35:09] Xanctius: It was way to silly for my taste
[0:35:12] raptorscream: ^
[0:35:22] Incredible_Sausage: the first shot of episode 1 should have been the last shot of episode 2. BOOM. move the story along from there.
[0:35:23] ItsNoxid: U miss cute steven tho
[0:35:27] FrozanFlames: you could watch the trailer watch episode 2 and probably have 90% of everything LUL

[0:35:33] raivo9n: did the speak about halo ?
[0:35:45] larkhill: feels like a show thats better off binged all at once rather than week by week
[0:35:46] 00_Exia94: no ep1 no laters gators
[0:35:51] raptorscream: Halo isnt Marvel
[0:36:02] FrozanFlames: it was also more moonknight
[0:36:02] toaobadger: la'ahs ga'ahs
[0:36:04] prfella: @raivo9n halo isnt marvel
[0:36:21] Siggenlh: Legion is good?
[0:36:26] BigWaldo7713: look i loved the suit gag
[0:36:27] Tyronin: I'm super into it so far. It feels so different compared to anything Marvel has done
[0:36:31] BigWaldo7713: so good
[0:36:33] BlueSapphyre: legion is great @Siggenlh
[0:36:41] Wholemane: I wish it had a bit more edge to it.. Like Daredevil and Punisher
[0:36:43] b0ksah: @Siggenlh yup ...but talk about slow
[0:36:44] ReginaldXIV: KEKW
[0:36:47] Malanor85: I hope Ep3 is is going over the top
[0:37:26] rich16bit: It's more The Mummy/Shaun of the dead than Legion
[0:37:27] andaroo: @Malanor85 Episode 5 got accidently leaked, and many people think 5 and 4 are the best episodes
[0:37:27] ThatGunsFoHire: I feel like episode 1 and 2 are showing you the duality in the character in the different ways they were directed
[0:37:48] Tyronin: @ThatGunsFoHire this is totally what i felt too
[0:37:58] Siggenlh: what.
[0:38:09] Siggenlh: Shaun of the dead is great so is Hot Fuzz
[0:38:16] phil9s: Bronze definitely shouldn't move to the UK LUL
[0:38:17] LFC_Letters: episode 1 and 2 were the same episode by 2 different directors
[0:38:17] FrozanFlames: it is completely an out of place moment now NODDERS
[0:38:18] CozyConn: i feel like it was Konshu that was controlling him
[0:38:21] andaroo: It was Konshu
[0:38:33] toaobadger: zelaDownBad zelaDownBad zelaDance zelaDance
[0:38:41] LFC_Letters: Jake was the one who set up the date 100%
[0:38:43] BigWaldo7713: but konshu doesnt have control it showed in episode 2
[0:38:57] Poobzee: But if Khonshu can control why not do it all the time?
[0:39:01] Siggenlh: i guess Bronze dropped out Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead before the midle.
[0:39:06] jeffhunter12: yup
[0:39:12] Ceaseless_: good from his wife. thats why they like that same french obok
[0:39:14] Ceaseless_: book*
[0:39:25] FrozanFlames: Mark wishes he could live as Steven seems to be the setup of his character he doesn't want to be moonknight
[0:39:30] BigWaldo7713: hes a mercenary
[0:39:43] andaroo: Well and it makes sense if Jake set up the date
[0:39:43] SabertoothEwok: This show definitely is better if you don’t know moon knight from comics I feel
[0:39:43] Siggenlh: Marc only cares about himself it seems.
[0:39:50] Legionnare92: what
[0:39:55] Legionnare92: he is moon knight so his wife wont be
[0:39:56] Legionnare92: lol
[0:40:04] LessSanity: marc is the base person
[0:40:05] raptorscream: @Siggenlh Mark does it so Konshu wont take his wife instead of him
[0:40:11] Poobzee: I just wanna see where Steven came to be
[0:40:17] kazen01: steven being a version of his wife
[0:40:29] jeffhunter12: The way konshu talked about their body it seems steven might be the original of this body and mark got put in there to save him
[0:40:35] Siggenlh: i think we get another personality soon.
[0:40:45] Zrmi: Steven was the persona to hide him in 'normal life'
[0:40:51] LFC_Letters: i dont think we see Jake til episode 4
[0:40:53] Tyronin: im curious if we are going to see the otehr personality

[0:41:07] andaroo: Layla
[0:41:07] ThemDemo: Layla
[0:41:08] JosieSprings: Layla
[0:41:09] FrozanFlames: Layla
[0:41:11] nicklepolaroid: @jeffhunter12 I didn't understand that, I got that Marc was the base
[0:41:32] Tyronin: we never hear the mom talking
[0:41:38] SpaceDive: NotLikeThis what
[0:41:40] raptorscream: He leaves voice messages
[0:41:41] Norrak1: I have a feeling his mom is ignoring his calls
[0:41:41] jeffhunter12: konshu said that body doesnt belong to mark but that could also have been konshu being possesive
[0:41:50] zerohour_88: Konshu said he found Marc as a corpse, so that's a thing
[0:41:54] FrozanFlames: so now the real question is jake or marc the one who setup the date and was also working the museum job
[0:42:04] Siggenlh: did Konshu make Steve happen later on as a way to hide?
[0:42:06] Hundisilm: I thought Konshu put Marc in Steven because Marc died?
[0:42:21] Nightsharm: maybe the mum is the 3rd personality
[0:42:51] Barrh: also layla asks if this steven is one of his latest
[0:42:51] Siggenlh: ITS OCEANMAN
[0:42:52] zerohour_88: how Konshu saved Marc and made the deal is still a bit unclear
[0:43:01] prfella: @hundisilm nah marc existed before steven. steven doesnt exist until a few months ago
[0:43:07] Variandra: @Hundisilm i think they say "we were dead and konchu saved us"
[0:43:07] Protonerd: french? LUL
[0:43:07] MagnaCarter_: It is a terrible French accent
[0:43:30] jeffhunter12: its also hinted at during the credit scenes, both episodes had a image of london with anotehr city in the reflection
[0:43:39] FataltheBaptist: and steven has so much in common with marcs wife
[0:43:53] FrozanFlames: @MagnaCarter_ such a bad French accent it is a mediocre British one ijpKEK
[0:44:32] BigWaldo7713: yes
[0:44:33] Norrak1: Ya I think so
[0:44:33] raptorscream: yes, trace footstapes
[0:44:34] SpaceDive: fight club Hmm
[0:44:35] LFC_Letters: it just shows footprints yeah
[0:44:36] NixonNarwhal: yes, same as tape on door
[0:44:37] Poobzee: yea
[0:44:38] BigWaldo7713: to see if he got up at night
[0:44:39] Hundisilm: Sand was to detect sleep walking I think
[0:44:43] Fynagle: Same as the tape, to show if he left the apartment and bed.
[0:44:46] raptorscream: @itmeJP tape on the door, and sand ot see if he sleep walks
[0:44:47] BlueSapphyre: davy jones can't walk on land.
[0:44:48] ashrifts: @itmeJP yes and Marc just repalces it
[0:44:49] WDForty: that's what i think too
[0:44:49] 23Thijs: the sand was because he thought he was sleepwalking
[0:44:52] Nullstellensatz: his mom definitely doesn't exist, right
[0:44:53] ItsNoxid: he just thought was sleep walking
[0:45:00] rich16bit: I think Mark sees Steven as the best part of him and wants him to carry on when hes done
[0:45:15] 00_Exia94: do you think the scarab is the "thing that changed"
[0:45:23] Poobzee: or Marc can smooth the sand over and retape the door
[0:45:26] nicklepolaroid: It just seems like my worse nightmare
[0:45:27] Reijm11: I thought it was a ritual circle at first
[0:45:30] nicklepolaroid: I really hate sand
[0:45:33] Ceaseless_: @itmeJP did you notice the names of the police that are in the credits
[0:45:34] Hundisilm: to prevent snails
[0:45:35] Zaelsus: If this is post snap, could he have been snapped and the return messed up the personalities?
[0:45:40] Fynagle: Steven woke up in different places, so he uses the sand and tape to see if he actually left the bed while asleep.
[0:45:40] riot_vision710: i think he meant Supernatural

[0:52:07] raptorscream: Judging based on past, present and future
[0:52:08] FrozanFlames: A cult idolizing the loss of population and only keep the good people post snap really makes a lot of sense dead ass
[0:52:10] prfella: this is post snap, they already know about thanos and stuff
[0:52:11] KatjeMauw: they judge you for what you "might" do later
[0:52:15] Norrak1: Killing children is where we should draw the line hah

[0:53:07] kazen01: he does have the charisma of a cult leader LUL
[0:53:17] Hundisilm: Weren't they just people who lived there?
[0:53:24] NixonNarwhal: like that old lady he kills lul
[0:53:29] Zaelsus: Imagine if it's not exactly judging good people, but judging people that can be used by the gods (unaware to Arthur, or even with him aware)
[0:53:32] Hundisilm: And they like him because he's nice and stuff
[0:53:32] Zandivya: So why is the Jackal invisible? Is the moonknight costume invisible to normal people? Did they just see Steven flinging himself against a car?
[0:53:50] Osskssa: @Hundisilm no they were all cultists
[0:53:50] prfella: @zandivya only avatars can see them
[0:53:51] Kalzone1: He also specifically said to Steven “the difference between the medicine and the disease is dosage”
[0:53:58] Texaimian: It’s crazy how often London is the center of attention for MCU recently
[0:53:59] Gorn_Vernaleer: they were acting very brain washed, that was a bit weird if there is really no other control mechanism
[0:54:08] MostlyHype: I hope we get an explanation of why Harrow switched
[0:54:11] FrozanFlames: @Zandivya Layla could see the suit but not the jackal so do not think so.

[0:56:29] m3rcer: 99% sure hes succing them
[0:56:31] Norrak1: My theory is he doesn't sleep and uses people as power source
[0:56:31] MostlyHype: Didnt he say the same thing to the  old lady in episode 1
[0:56:32] kazen01: sounds about right
[0:56:44] Osskssa: cos when he touched him taking the scarab off him he new he was bad
[0:56:45] prfella: @m3rcer cohhMy
[0:56:45] Zandivya: I think the judgement isn't real. It's just Amit eating souls.
[0:56:47] Zrmi: Avatar of Mephisto? Kappa
[0:56:53] m3rcer: @prfella u know hes doing it cohhMy
[0:56:54] raptorscream: he is not an Avatar, he said that the Staff was of the 1st Avatar, and that's it
[0:56:56] jeffhunter12: that would explain the the jackal mummies
[0:56:59] Poobzee: Ammit
[0:57:06] NeonFlux: anubis is death
[0:57:11] prfella: @m3rcer NODDERS
[0:57:13] Nullstellensatz: didn't he say he was an avatar for khonshu before
[0:57:21] jeffhunter12: Death isnt evil
[0:57:22] m3rcer: yeah but neutral Death
[0:57:24] khascien: Death isn't evil - death is neutral
[0:57:26] LeelandGrant: anubis does not kill you though

[0:57:30] riot_vision710: I'm pretty sure @nullstellensatz right
[0:57:30] Osskssa: death isnt evil
[0:57:30] raptorscream: Death is neutral
[0:57:34] stoner2k: anyone see the gorr god butcher toy ? yikes
[0:57:38] LeelandGrant: he just takes care of your soul after your death
[0:57:41] Norrak1: He doesn't use the staff with the homeless man though
[0:57:42] Ogrekidd: anbuis is a pshycopomp he ferrys the dead he is not god of the dead
[0:57:43] Ginji_____: Anubis judges and Ammit eats the bad one
[0:57:58] BlueSapphyre: @stoner2k they talked about it at the top of the show.

[0:58:05] Rambler: @stoner2k they went through them earlier
[0:58:05] jeffhunter12: He simply judges the dead
[0:58:08] nicklepolaroid: Hades is getting a redemption arc because of Persephone, so it makes sense that Anubis isn't the bad guy
[0:58:11] Ravnim: arthur was konshu's avatar, so he probably has tech from before
[0:58:13] MrMX0121: Yes, we has played AC Origins
[0:58:18] KatjeMauw: the croc god he says he works for is the one that eats your soul if you werent judged good enough for afterlife
[0:58:19] Poobzee: Ma'at judges
[0:58:19] GrakusWolf: Osiris is the God of the dead. Anubis is like the God of funeral rites. Ammit judges people.
[0:58:19] ItsNoxid: i wanna play assassins creed origin now
[0:58:54] Osskssa: @ItsNoxid lol stop i just restarted Valhalla i cant switch back now!
[0:59:08] ItsNoxid: @Osskssa I still need to do that
[0:59:11] Xanctius: Moon Knight isnt afraid of killing, so why hasnt he just ...killed Arthur Harrow with a rifle yet?
[0:59:17] Zrmi: Why did Moon Knight runs from that Jackal when in eps 1 he smashes that in 2 seconds?
[0:59:28] ReginaldXIV: tis a jackal tis is tis is
[0:59:29] KatjeMauw: Zrmi the people
[0:59:34] Osskssa: no its werewolf by night lolkeke all those people smh
[0:59:34] khascien: But isn't that just because jackals are stereotypical egyptian - and this is Marvel.
[0:59:34] m3rcer: @Zrmi get away from ppl to make it safe i think
[0:59:35] KatjeMauw: that were around
[0:59:35] raptorscream: @Zrmi run form populated area
[0:59:37] everyhoohoo: @Zrmi cause steven was in control not marc
[0:59:38] Variandra: @Zrmi to get it away from the ppl.
[0:59:49] prfella: @zrmi he was getting it away from the people
[1:00:05] Zrmi: Why take it away from the people though when he can take it out easily? Its not like he gets a chance to hurt people
[1:00:08] everyhoohoo: ope i missunderstood question dont mind me LUL
[1:00:14] rich16bit: he said that he was the old fist
[1:00:22] Osskssa: @everyhoohoo no Moonknight is always Marc
[1:00:24] raptorscream: did he ever said he was an Avatar though? he jsut said the staff/cane was of the 1st Avatar
[1:00:26] m3rcer: @Zrmi cool jumping shots like Disney logo i guess
[1:00:33] PsychOnRails: Why Konshi did not recognize him as Anubis though?
[1:00:34] jeffhunter12: clearly hes mephisto
[1:00:36] prfella: @zrmi he wanted to make sure no one got hurt by mistake
[1:00:37] Ravnim: he can't bend all the element Hmm big sus
[1:00:42] pc2400: Avatar? the blue people? or the anime?
[1:00:43] khascien: Well if he's lived through it, then I'd say "Not this shit again" is the vibe he gave.
[1:00:44] Osskssa: @raptorscream said he was Konshus former avatar
[1:00:56] raptorscream: @Osskssa oh, ok, i missed/forgot that
[1:01:01] Poobzee: the way Arthur went from "lets take a walk" to "where's the scarab" was top tier villainous
[1:01:05] Zrmi: @prfella If he wanted to make sure no one got hurt he should have just taken it out right away in stread of letting it run around
[1:01:08] WDForty: didn't he also say he used to serve Khonshu before Ammit
[1:01:09] prfella: @raptorscream huh no he said he was the former fist of kkhonshu
[1:01:16] riot_vision710: yeah just cause he said that doesn't mean we should take it a face value
[1:01:16] LFC_Letters: that sounds familar yeah
[1:01:17] JosieSprings: Yes
[1:01:18] VTuberThighsChokeVictim: He does
[1:01:19] Protonerd: Yeah that's what he said
[1:01:19] m3rcer: Ammit's avatar did betray her
[1:01:22] jeffhunter12: he did say she was betrayed by sooomeone
[1:01:24] everyhoohoo: @Osskssa yeah but i thought they meant why wasnt steven fighting when the jackel first popped up not why marc ran to move the jackel from people
[1:01:24] ThemDemo: Betrayed by the other gods right?
[1:01:26] Variandra: @itmeJP betrayed by other gods avatars
[1:01:37] Poobzee: i think Khonshu was the betrayer he said
[1:01:41] bogidude17: Didn't khonshu acknoledge that arthur was his previous avatar?
[1:01:44] Buzz_Ruzz: i think he did say "her own avatar"
[1:01:48] MostlyHype: ok what if they pull a fight club
[1:01:49] Ginji_____: did he not say he is the first avatar of ammit?
[1:02:00] VTuberThighsChokeVictim: Other Gods and her own avatar, i think?
[1:02:00] 1sttimelurker: betrayed by other gods
[1:02:04] Hundisilm: They Cesare'd her?
[1:02:06] riot_vision710: troooo
[1:02:09] m3rcer: betrayed by other gods and HER avatar
[1:02:14] JosieSprings: Other gods and her own avatar
[1:02:15] prfella: @zrmi he didnt let it lol, steven was mucking around first. even Layla screamed at him"lead it away from the ppl" i think youre just overthinking this mate LUl
[1:02:22] Redvelvet84: open Disney, skip to the scene and eliminate doubt
[1:02:35] GrakusWolf: Khonshu did want Steven to kill him like right away, in a bitter ex kinda way
[1:02:36] KingRahe: Black panther is basts avatar
[1:03:04] Osskssa: crush his windpipe!
[1:03:07] Zrmi: @prfella NO, Mark was in control. He took that jackal out in 2 seconds in eps 1. Really no reason to lead it away when you can take it out easily.
[1:03:40] Zrmi: It's not like that Jackal was a Hulk smashing buildings
[1:03:44] riot_vision710: who do you think Steven is talking to when he calls his mother? @itmejp
[1:03:46] ThemDemo: @Zrmi he was alone in ep 1 and not ep 2, apples to oranges there
[1:03:49] KingNightOwl: But Khonshu also talks to Steven like we was Marc as well.
[1:03:59] Osskssa: @Zrmi did it cos it looked cool! :P
[1:04:01] bogidude17: @riot_vision710 I think it is just voicemail
[1:04:01] m3rcer: @riot_vision710 it seems like he was making a voicemail
[1:04:09] LFC_Letters: im still convinced this is pre snap
[1:04:10] Gertew: hes passport was renewed in 2018
[1:04:12] pc2400: steven wasn't snapped
[1:04:13] MostlyHype: passport had a post snap date
[1:04:13] Norrak1: We dont even know if there was a snap
[1:04:18] Gromsky: his passport shows that he wasn't snapped
[1:04:18] Hundisilm: Was there even a snap
[1:04:18] MagnaCarter_: We also don't know when this is set
[1:04:21] Ceaseless_: its after snap @LFC_Letters
[1:04:24] prfella: @zrmi bro..he had to use a BUILDING to impale it and he still needed his moon rangs. youre implying he just used his fists to one shit him. he needed help to kill it.  again youre overthinking it
[1:04:27] BlueSapphyre: Ammit.
[1:04:28] Siggenlh: they still have not mentioned ocean man either
[1:04:28] riot_vision710: that's sounds right
[1:04:32] Sir_Nerdly: Is Layla the “out” in case Oscar doesn’t want to do it anymore?
[1:04:33] WDForty: @itmeJP we do know that Marc's passport was renewed during the snap
[1:04:35] ItsNoxid: there was a pass port for marc that was renewed during snap
[1:04:35] Poobzee: Ammit
[1:04:37] Darkaros: korra is the avatar AYAYA
[1:04:39] T3rrortrooper: Marc Specter survived the snap @itmeJP we see it on the passport
[1:04:40] appaomega: Ammit the Crocdile
[1:04:44] riot_vision710: just talking to himself
[1:04:48] ThemDemo: It's a lot of lore to keep up with for sure
[1:04:48] prfella: @zrmi one shot*
[1:04:54] Hundisilm: Arthur?
[1:04:58] Gertew: the us passport was renewed in 2018 expires in 2028
[1:05:00] jeffhunter12: couuuld be
[1:05:05] NixonNarwhal: this makes sense
[1:05:16] Zrmi: @prfella he didnt need it.. It was all just for cgi action scene and that's just bad writing
[1:05:17] Sonatta: ijpHMM
[1:05:21] 0GHammer: KEKW except that Thanos isnt from Earth
[1:05:26] Sonatta: that's a big brain theory

[1:06:23] WDForty: @bogidude17 there's GRC ads on the buses
[1:06:37] Deleroth: mark's passport was done during the snap time
[1:06:41] GrakusWolf: pretty sure he just quit. Marq  could do the same but won't because his wife would be the next Avatar.
[1:06:42] bogidude17: @WDForty Yeah I asked and then JP answered
[1:06:43] prfella: post blip, actually @itmejp

[1:06:58] rapidshot20: crack YEP
[1:06:59] Hundisilm: well
[1:07:00] Sir_Myrmidon: re: Snap - were the gods snapped? Did half of the pantheon cease to exist?
[1:07:00] Osskssa: i just love crack...
[1:07:06] riot_vision710: so if it's post that makes it what 2019?
[1:07:07] Deleroth: it's all in his head :)
[1:07:09] Hundisilm: the girl also so her when she threw stuff at it
[1:07:16] Hundisilm: saw
[1:07:19] gooseboy429: in winter soldier there was mention of something in egypt
[1:07:37] m3rcer: i mean i guess technically theres isnt a rule saying 1 avatar only
[1:07:37] Deleroth: doesn't Bronze understand how being an airbender works?
[1:07:38] riot_vision710: nikaCult nikaCult
[1:07:40] 00_Exia94: NODDERS
[1:07:44] GoblinGraphx: well moon Knight is the Left first
[1:07:45] Munetani_NJimha: Well there are more than one avater, just to start you have the film and anime
[1:07:49] Ceaseless_: I think the first 3 episodes is some retelling of events which explains gaps from location to location and we find mark in the mental ward in of ep 3 due to Bobbi and Billy being listed by name in ep 2
[1:07:49] dahak777: @Sir_Myrmidon that would be a good question. i would think yes.
[1:07:51] VisualRenegade: But then wouldn't he just make Leyla another avatar?
[1:07:55] Sir_Nerdly: There’s more than one in the latest comic run @itmejp
[1:08:05] m3rcer: granted that invalidates the wifey threat tho
[1:08:11] Hundisilm: Because Ammit would do a next Snap
[1:08:15] frozen_eggo: its cause ammit murders future murderers
[1:08:16] Deleroth: @Sir_Myrmidon to an atheist, did they ever?
[1:08:18] Hundisilm: wasn't it explained somewheer?
[1:08:31] jeffhunter12: Yeah they made it clear ammit was baaaaaaaaaad
[1:08:41] riot_vision710: I think you have to be on the brink of death to become an avatar
[1:08:49] Hundisilm: I thought it was because Ammit would just immediately kill anyone who would do bad in the future
[1:08:54] muffinface__: @itmeJP maybe he is Hunter's Moon?
[1:09:00] Hundisilm: i.e. almost anyone
[1:09:00] LFC_Letters: they need to do that comic panel... its conic
[1:09:05] riot_vision710: your soul might have to be unmoored
[1:09:16] ghostsofcarcosa: Nah bronze is right those who oppose this must be shut down.
[1:09:17] Zrmi: He doesnt want Ammit to become a god of the level of  Khonshu. Ammit is lesser than a god
[1:09:40] ThemDemo: Yeah Khonshu does the break-down builld-up playbook very well
[1:09:45] Legionnare92: he knows he owns marc cuz he threatens using his wife
[1:09:48] SpaceDive: monkaS

[1:13:20] GrakusWolf: Aliens
[1:13:21] prfella: @sarcasticfiend mephisto Kappa
[1:13:25] Zrmi: I think it's all about Ammit wanting to become one of the Ennead
[1:13:30] Siggenlh: im hoping the first episode was the "filler" one. but we are already in Egypt.
[1:13:42] DrTazerFace: Shit you right. It’s always Mephisto
[1:13:52] prfella: @sarcasticfiend NODDERS
[1:14:07] VTuberThighsChokeVictim: I believe in the comics its the same Bast in moon knight and wakanda and the black panter is basts' avatar
[1:14:13] Weirwood: Is the Black Panther the Avatar of Bast?
[1:14:13] ThemDemo: Wakanda is located directly south from Egypt and not too far away in the MCU
[1:14:16] DrewM87: @itmejp people think they go the avatar route with Bast to "continue" black panther because in the canon Shuri is trying to "create" new flowers but can't
[1:14:22] BlueSapphyre: @Weirwood yes.
[1:14:27] bogidude17: @SarcasticFiend My bet is on Julia louis-dreyfuss
[1:14:31] mexican_computer: monkaHmm Which egyptian god is Mephisto?
[1:14:32] prfella: @weirwood yup
[1:14:47] GrakusWolf: WAIT A SEC! there were two black panthers for a bit. what if there can be two avatars?
[1:14:54] Weirwood: ok cool
[1:14:55] riot_vision710: we can hope Jack the werewolf guy might get a post credit setup at the end of the series @itmejp
[1:14:55] DrTazerFace: @bogidude17 oooo I could get down with Elaine
[1:15:02] Variandra: @GrakusWolf that talked about that already
[1:15:15] Deleroth: nick fury going to show up
[1:15:32] 23Thijs: you really shouldnt expect crossovers with every project they do
[1:15:37] raptorscream: RDJ post credit
[1:15:37] GrakusWolf: it could be confur
[1:15:41] Zrmi: Werewolf by Night will visit in post credits
[1:15:42] WDForty: Captain Britan post credit?
[1:15:42] Siggenlh: dont think gonna have much than atmost a cameo or a refernce.

[1:16:15] antphilosophy: kid cudi is the best song for this show
[1:16:27] ReginaldXIV: Also it was a colorful vista and not the yellow filter
[1:16:28] Kalzone1: The director did say in an interview that they shot but removed a lot of the connections to the mcu. Wanted it to be more of its own thing
[1:16:29] m3rcer: i was surprised there was no tint danKEK
[1:16:34] ghostsofcarcosa: Also they had actually buildings near the Pyramid
[1:16:42] jeffhunter12: coxJam

[1:17:50] KingNightOwl: mexico is always sepia
[1:17:52] nicklepolaroid: Maxico is like yellow / sepia
[1:17:54] LeelandGrant: eastern europe = grey

[1:18:01] jeffhunter12: i HATe those color filters
[1:18:02] CEINARU: LUL
[1:18:03] prfella: @themdemo the director is eygyptian. the actress for layla is also egyptian
[1:18:05] MythGameStream: @itmeJP I wonder if the Ancestral Realm has a souvenir shop called Bast Pro Shop.
[1:18:06] Siggenlh: blue in the nordics.
[1:18:06] Norrak1: Extraction on Netflix

[1:18:18] OmarKhaledBadr: The piss filter is so offensive as Egyptian seriously
[1:18:20] m3rcer: fun movie but it was full of tint
[1:18:20] raptorscream: Extraction is great, except the tint
[1:18:21] SlipCrit: out
[1:18:21] eridani3: LUL
[1:18:23] Darkaros: ijpKEK I still can't believe that movie got a sequel
[1:18:24] Weirwood: That knife fight is fantastic
[1:18:24] ghostsofcarcosa: Its complete nonsense
[1:18:25] ReginaldXIV: That's a lot of tint
[1:18:36] Hundisilm: You mean it doesn't actually look like that?
[1:18:48] El_Zilcho22: did they do that in X-men Apocalypse? i don't remember
[1:18:49] ReginaldXIV: They filter New York and LA a lot too
[1:18:49] pc2400: and Scandinavian countries are cold blue tint
[1:18:49] shadowoflight_: Extraction was terrible
[1:18:50] ThemDemo: @prfella yeah I know, they are doing a great job hiring representative creators for the cultures to be highlighted
[1:18:52] bogidude17: I feel like the South is also tinted sometimes in movies but I could be wrong
[1:18:56] jeffhunter12: its a crutch
[1:19:02] da3mon_01: and each alien planet is just vancouver
[1:19:04] Zrmi: They are making Extraction part 2 also

[1:19:05] Weirwood: beats the crap out of those little kids

[1:19:12] raptorscream: Extraction was great
[1:19:17] prfella: @themdemo ms marvel is doing the same with indian
[1:19:38] Poobzee: the kid he's extracting is a pretty good actor too
[1:19:39] ThemDemo: @prfella ijpNODDERS
[1:19:41] Osskssa: @prfella not Indian
[1:19:47] Siggenlh: difrent tints makes sense for other world due to light refraction in difretn atmosphere compositions. on Earth only if there is smog or a storm.
[1:19:51] Hundisilm: The action in Extraction is pretty good though no?
[1:20:02] raptorscream: @Hundisilm yeah, long cuts
[1:20:07] Hundisilm: it was directed by a stunt co-ordinator I think
[1:20:26] MagnaCarter_: @Hundisilm the director is a veteran stunt coordinator/director so it's got some solid fight scenes/cinematography
[1:20:28] ghostsofcarcosa: and they played it in Endgame don't they
[1:20:29] KingNightOwl: AaaaaaaaaAAAAH
[1:20:39] Siggenlh: the marvel themes are just background noise for me. i dont really notice them
[1:20:43] bogidude17: We starting to talk about leitmotifs? ijpSUS ijpSUS
[1:20:44] raptorscream: wasnt Extraction directed by the same dudes that make John Wick?
[1:20:47] DrTazerFace: But it does work
[1:20:50] ThemDemo: Oscar's performance is so fucking good
[1:20:52] Docgalaad: Golshifteh Farahani is certainly represented better in Extraction than in Invasion.
[1:20:55] rypta: khonshu's stupid voice?
[1:21:08] jeffhunter12: that scene at the end with steven in the mirror was so gooood
[1:21:15] jeffhunter12: yeah that was also amazing
[1:21:18] Variandra: @itmeJP can u tlak about how Khonshu yells "you have no conscience" to the cult leader
[1:21:35] Barrh: or is it marc in the mirror
[1:21:37] Masterpug13: We don't know that is Mark in Egypt.
[1:21:38] akmannen: some people think thats jake in the end and not marc
[1:21:42] Barrh: and jake on the floor
[1:21:43] raptorscream: Time Skip
[1:21:43] Deadpixzl: its marc in the mirror
[1:21:47] Deadpixzl: and Jake drinking
[1:21:50] Weirwood: The trailer scene had me thinking the mirror kicking was 100% Steven. It's very interesting that it was Marc losing control
[1:21:53] BigMeatSunday: That's not Mark. XD
[1:22:06] KingNightOwl: time skip
[1:22:38] Crimsonomi: time skip
[1:22:43] OmarKhaledBadr: The cinematography is impressive as hell
[1:22:57] raptorscream: 1st ep had good cinematography too
[1:23:03] Siggenlh: might be realtime for steven. since he might not have had a chance to do the mirrorthing until now.
[1:23:05] raptorscream: with all the refelction stots
[1:23:07] raptorscream: shots*
[1:23:18] DrewM87: @itmeJP The guys that directed episode 2 and 4 of MoonKnight are directing season 2 of Loki

[1:33:42] GregoryGlen: Captain Britian when
[1:33:45] Hundisilm: Is there a blade movie planned?
[1:33:46] Crafteroon: I mean the realistic thing would be for the celestial body to turn into a political issue with china claiming it as belonging to their "territorial waters", but I don't think MCU has the balls to go that deep.
[1:33:46] nicklepolaroid: Dracula owes him money, it's more important than the dude in the sky
[1:33:47] JosieSprings: Captain Carterrr?
[1:33:48] MagnaCarter_: Can we get Henry Cavill as Capt. Britain, please?
[1:33:55] Sonatta: if Captain Britian shows up.... does Olivia Munn show up as Psylocke again?

[1:34:02] MrPotato42_: Spider-UK? PauseChamp
[1:34:05] rich16bit: Moon Knight in Blade fighting Dracula?

[1:34:27] EndyBT: Cap Brit can’t be here without mutants…please marvel
[1:34:31] 00_Exia94: bring nick cage back for ghost rider

[1:35:01] SpaceDive: morbius Hmm
[1:35:01] Hundisilm: Nah 90% games get delayed :p
[1:35:03] DrTazerFace: Eternals end credits would agree
[1:35:07] nicklepolaroid: Aren't we getting the X-Men with Dr Strange?
[1:35:27] pc2400: Do the MCU TV show do post credits that tie into movies?
[1:35:35] Crafteroon: They could make the first season of Midnight Sons just be the crew gathering and meeting eachother.
[1:35:41] Doom2soon: @Stalker2400 on some episodes, not all
[1:35:49] Critternation3000: @Stalker2400 sometimes
[1:35:56] pc2400: @Stalker2400 I can only think of Wandavision
[1:36:02] NinjaXI: @Stalker2400 theo do do post credits, whether it ties into movies or not remains to be seen
[1:36:05] Siggenlh: so the only way disney get people to subsrice is trickling down the content. i keep getting months long hiatuses for each show.
[1:36:08] ritchie313: henry cavill would be good as anything
[1:36:10] riot_vision710: oh for sure

[1:36:18] albino_anteater: That guy was great though
[1:36:19] Zrmi: Doctor Voodoo would be cool
[1:36:21] Sir_Myrmidon: that was a good Ghost Rider
[1:36:24] SlipCrit: make nice cage robbie remaster mentor
[1:36:29] MagnaCarter_: Cavill could play any role in MCU and we'd all be happy
[1:36:35] SlipCrit: reyas*
[1:36:36] WDForty: one of the crazy theories right now is that the current MCU we know, is a "House of M" messed up world that's forgotten about Mutants, and something is going to happen to undo that shit and everyone will remember mutants and they will come back
[1:36:42] MythGameStream: Agent Coulsen comes back as Ghost Rider.

[1:37:24] nicklepolaroid: @osakey But Deadpool is part of the MCU now, isn't he?
