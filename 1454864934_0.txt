[1:06:13] WDForty: Curiosity has one for educational youtubers, and Floatplane has mostly tech youtubers
[1:06:14] ArgusTangentti: floatplane is the reason they know you should stay out of video stuff Keepo
[1:06:22] BlazeRom: they mentioned a long time ago they wanted to try and separate from you tube, right ?
[1:06:24] GraveSalad: Floatplane is why Linus got into all the server stuff lately
[1:06:25] BlazeRom: on their podcast
[1:06:26] Nickonil: the guy "luke" that we saw for a few sec is the TEO of that company
[1:06:26] Jtbrig1: @itmeJP Yep in case Youtube went tits up they are safe.
[1:06:28] DrTazerFace: They’re building a million dollar pc…..
[1:06:28] GunzGames: It's not nearly as much money as you think.

[1:07:51] tinyBlipInHistory: lol
[1:07:54] Reckless_Rob: Thats a big PSP
[1:07:54] BlazeRom: "turns out"
[1:07:56] Jtbrig1: @itmeJP Because Nintendo was flagging videos that was emulating switch on the SteamDeck Linux is working on a vid of that as a FU to nintendo lol.
[1:08:06] Jtbrig1: Linus..
[1:08:06] DrTazerFace: For only $100 per bott
[1:08:13] Mrshilka: but buy this 5k apple hat

[1:08:41] Ebra: index?
[1:08:45] zymioi: @please_stop_banning_mii yes i seen some u tube videos
[1:08:50] ElSpartin: I have a steam link
[1:08:54] BlazeRom: steam machines were total failures, I remember that
[1:08:54] ErrorOtter: steam controller was good
[1:08:56] ArgusTangentti: Link good
[1:08:57] Gorn_Vernaleer: steam link is great
[1:08:58] Wchillinman: True LUL
[1:09:01] countmarcula: conveniently not mentioning the Index
[1:09:04] Wurf13: i liked the stream controller
[1:09:05] Miros__: ...this guy not heaard of the Index?
[1:09:06] DrTazerFace: The steam link turned me off of ever buying Valve hardware
[1:09:06] NoorElBahrain: what about the index?
[1:09:08] zymioi: @please_stop_banning_mii but i am not sure how will so keep that in mind
[1:09:08] Lysara11: I have a Steam Controller, I like it
[1:09:08] Javtastrophe: if you needed steam links theyre actually godlike
[1:09:12] Kaleith: same for the controller, their only failure was the steam machines project
[1:09:15] Redvelvet84: casualy ignoring the VR hardware?
[1:09:16] Laursi_: I still use my steam link on occasion
[1:09:17] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[1:09:17] GraveSalad: Steam Controllers and Link became Steam Input and Remote Play so they're still used, just not hardware based
[1:09:18] vin88x: I have both the steam link and steam controller
[1:09:22] Nickonil: yeah wtf, the index is awesome as far as i understood LUL
[1:09:34] GraveSalad: Index isn't a failure so didn't fit the narrative
[1:09:38] Estegard: People, bear in mind that MKBHD has said before that he's not that much of a gamer or into gaming.
[1:09:39] zymioi: this will be good for warframe
[1:09:42] Mrshilka: because the index does not feed his narative chat
[1:09:45] tinyBlipInHistory: thats wide
[1:09:51] Kaleith: skin
[1:09:56] 00_Exia94: skin
[1:09:58] Nickonil: d-brand skin?
[1:09:58] BlazeRom: looks good in white
[1:09:59] GrannySith: he talks about it
[1:09:59] alonzogarbanzo: no it's a skin
[1:10:01] Hemry64_: D-brand probably
[1:10:02] Estegard: dbrand skin most likely
[1:10:06] zymioi: @please_stop_banning_mii all so wifi lol to play i think lol
[1:10:10] BlazeRom: SMOrc BIG
[1:10:18] its__fil: You can also 3D print your own Steam Deck shell, they put out the files for it
[1:10:24] ElSpartin: One day I'll be able to convert grams to Lbs
[1:10:25] Mmmmbacon1: reminds me of my white Vita
[1:10:28] BlazeRom: I'm curios if Nintendo will care about this
[1:10:39] zymioi: @please_stop_banning_mii and warframe would be good for it to i want one might get one end of the year
[1:10:48] Yohhakkai: i'm constantly at home, fuck i havent touched my switch in years LUL
[1:10:50] Hemry64_: I wish they would Sadge
[1:10:53] tinyBlipInHistory: drifter?
[1:10:56] Rawrsong: They cared enough to try to prevent emulation on the Steam deck
[1:10:58] MartymusPrime95: Gona play Rimworld in bed with this only PogChamp
[1:10:59] BlazeRom: fair enough
[1:11:00] Nickonil: i mean its a linux pc thats optimised for steam games spesificly
[1:11:00] Darkaros: stripUgg Too many buttons
[1:11:01] ErrorOtter: nintendo knows they have their market locked down
[1:11:03] Sonatta: nintendo's core audience is 15 year olds
[1:11:03] BaldurCZ: ijpNODDERS
[1:11:04] Haeher: nintendo makes its money with their first party games
[1:11:05] KingRahe: nintendo sells nostalgia
[1:11:10] nKoalaBear: ppl who buy nintendo products like the games not the hardwate
[1:11:15] BlazeRom: I can see taking this on a business trip
[1:11:16] Zaalri: it sucks, i want one but for rogue lites and casual games, which cant justify the price
[1:11:16] 00oniking00: they talk about battery life yet?
[1:11:24] Gorn_Vernaleer: @MartymusPrime95 yes! Me too! They even optimized it, so awesome.
[1:11:27] 00_Exia94: nintendo will only care if switch emulation gets really good on the steam deck
[1:11:29] countmarcula: they're gonna care when people start running Yuzu and Ryujinx on it
[1:11:36] MartymusPrime95: @MartymusPrime95 coxHypers
[1:11:39] NoorElBahrain: nintendo has exclusive games that drive sales too
[1:11:52] ArgentEsper: People have jury rigged full windows onto the steam deck. It's definitely more for enthusiasts.
[1:11:55] Rawrsong: Headphone jack Kreygasm
[1:11:58] zymioi: better frames for stardew valley !!!!
[1:12:03] vin88x: I always wondered what happened to L3 R3
[1:12:05] 00oniking00: @dontcarebear1983 i'm not a nintendo fan but there is some games i want to play and is a buy if one day comes to pc
[1:12:11] Bob__Z: Nintendo has three games, Mario, link, pikachoo
[1:12:22] 00oniking00: nope
[1:12:23] its__fil: *cough* you can also buy and put an SSD in the cheapest version *cough*
[1:12:25] BlazeRom: Elden Ring alone is 50 gigs
[1:12:28] NoorElBahrain: 512 for CoD
[1:12:28] Redvelvet84: @vin88x push the sticks
[1:12:29] VektoorZ: As a new dad, being able to play my steam library anywhere in the house with and easy suspend option, i can't wait to get mine
[1:12:30] Darkaros: I have 60 gigs of XCOM2 + mods
[1:12:35] Gorn_Vernaleer: @ArgentEsper not much rigging needed, valve even released drivers for windows lol
[1:12:35] zymioi: @Avalier ijpD ijpD
[1:12:36] Sonatta: Call of Duty isn't running on that LUL

[1:12:48] DrTazerFace: I just saw the story about a guy that hooked his gfx card to the deck to get 4K etc. at that point why not just buy a pc LUL
[1:12:52] ErrorOtter: this dude is basic
[1:12:53] Estegard: Of course MArques is playing NBA 2K LUL
[1:12:53] vin88x: @Redvelvet84 Ah! good call 👍

[1:14:06] BlazeRom: but then I remember how much I used the switch after I got it
[1:14:10] DrTazerFace: They don’t
[1:14:20] Gorn_Vernaleer: @ReginaldXIV it's a thrid party skin

[1:14:21] zymioi: playing monster hunter on this game while pooping is a dream
[1:14:23] shumbody0: most games are at 30fps otherwise its 0 battery
[1:14:25] NoorElBahrain: ReginaldXIV it is a skin apparently and ijpHI

[1:14:53] ghostsofcarcosa: Oh the emotes pop up now when I type them
[1:14:55] ghostsofcarcosa: that's new I love this

[1:15:07] Mrshilka: @ghostsofcarcosa Ghosty Pog
[1:15:08] Sonatta: wait... if there's a delay... how do you play shooters are on it?
[1:15:11] DoctorJohn: right now I just don't have a lot of games I really want to play that I could play on this thing
[1:15:12] ReginaldXIV: Shoutouts to the Timberwolves for making playoffs before they get shut out again
[1:15:23] Kaleith: shoes on white sofa WTFF

[1:15:40] 00oniking00: we need a new battery technology, for cars, phones, notebooks and now hand consoles
[1:15:41] Jtbrig1: FF14 on this is the dream imo
[1:15:44] unreliable_witness: @Kaleith Shoes inside in general WTFF
[1:15:47] DoctorJohn: lost ark controller mapping is awful
[1:15:49] xystus_: lost ark doesnt work
[1:15:50] Darkaros: You could get tilted at people ragequitting your raid. IN BED. DoctorJohn .
[1:15:51] Sonatta: FF14 runs on it @Jtbrig1
[1:15:55] zymioi: @DoctorJohn stardew valley while pooping
[1:15:55] Lestarion: lost ark doesn't work on steam deck, sadly
[1:16:00] tinyBlipInHistory: ff14 crafting too
[1:16:05] DoctorJohn: @darkaros ALREADY DO hahahaha
[1:16:07] DrTazerFace: Did you order one JP?
[1:16:07] Jtbrig1: @Sonatta Ya I know :) can't wait to get one.
[1:16:10] DoctorJohn: oh wow it actually doesn't work? damn
[1:16:13] Gorn_Vernaleer: @Sonatta there is allways a delay, no matter what device, it's just that you have to familiarize yourselfe to slightly diffrent delays from device to device
[1:16:18] Collected1: feels like this still needs a few more years of refinement and advancement of technology
[1:16:20] Nickonil: Elden Ring runs very well from what i heard
[1:16:27] PoloDan: @reginaldxiv I am so ready to have my soul crushed when they inevitably get destroyed
[1:16:29] Kaleith: it runs natively and it doesn't have the stuttering issue thanks to a valve patch
[1:16:30] ok_juju: elden ring runs on linux
[1:16:34] SuaveSentinel: based
[1:16:35] Hemry64_: Saaame
[1:16:36] Lestarion: elden ring runs beautifull and doesn't have the stutter problems the pc version has
[1:16:37] freaktechnik: it famously ran better on deck than on windows because valve did some optimization in the translation layer
[1:16:39] Trumpetmcool: same
[1:16:40] GraveSalad: not natively, but it runs better in Linux than Windows on my PC currently
[1:16:43] DoctorJohn: even though I'm not picking up first gen, this is an EXCELLENT first iteration and I'm very very impressed honestly
[1:16:45] Jtbrig1: @itmeJP Not native but because of what Valve did with the Proton that runs it. It doesn't have the studder issue it does on windows.
[1:16:46] Notenoughcoffee: elden ring has a bunch of popping on grass
[1:16:47] NoorElBahrain: Trumpetmcool ijpHI
[1:16:48] ModMV: Digital Foundry did a whole deep dive on how Valve created a hack to smooth out Elden Ring's loading issues.  It was fascinating
[1:16:53] Trumpetmcool: hai NoorElBahrain :)
[1:16:59] CriddleCakes: I wish the sticks were asymmetrical.
[1:17:02] 00_Exia94: same, not for me but I am very excited to see where the tech eventually leads
[1:17:02] Puretaz: valve patched elden ring especially for steam deck for it to run well
[1:17:14] NoorElBahrain: Trumpetmcool hope you are well
[1:17:15] its__fil: Anti-cheat is holding back some of the multiplayer games but they're working on it
[1:17:22] Nickonil: well "Linux" pc shrunk down..
[1:17:27] DoctorJohn: oh it's the anti cheat?
[1:17:28] ok_juju: Easy anti cheat most of the time is the issue for linux gaming

[1:19:06] Yohhakkai: did jp saw mythforce yet? i joined late
[1:19:13] Moohirim: if that is the case, then blitz is also crashing the pc, cause i crashed with that running
[1:19:17] LeroyGankins: Oh my U.GG does do that. It moves teh window around constantly
[1:19:18] DoctorJohn: why is league so separated between its launcher and the actual game, I can't think of another game like it
[1:19:20] afreak10: try a day without it
[1:19:20] JBfromAccounting: u.gg doesn't like some resolutions
[1:19:25] NoorElBahrain: upgrade time hypeE
[1:19:26] Darkaros: disconnect your monitors before playing League NODDERS become a bot
[1:19:28] PoloDan: I have 2 different monitors and that same screen flash just started for me
[1:19:28] GraveSalad: Some games really hate multi-monitors, especially if they're not all the same
[1:19:34] AinzN: What I'm hearing is Regi is sneaking into your house and crashing the game themselves NODDERS
[1:19:45] Trumpetmcool: yes NoorElBahrain hope ya'll are good too ^^ been meaning to stop by but been busy with life :)
[1:20:04] DoctorJohn: weird thing is I have a 3440x1440 monitor and then a side screen that is 1920x1080, and I have also crashed with league
[1:20:12] NoorElBahrain: Trumpetmcool I have been thanks. ijpHAPPY
[1:20:13] its__fil: put an AirTag in there so people can stalk me ijpKEK
[1:20:14] Nickonil: i am really upset that valve doesnt allow me to order this.. same with index.. since Norway isnt in the EU... like.. wtf..
[1:20:17] Angelos_42: his control - game delay seems to be because of the 30 fps limit he had turned on. More ppl had that issue with that particular game
[1:20:20] zymioi: yea i watch a video some hook up  a mouse and keyboard and tv crazy
[1:20:20] Trumpetmcool: good :)
[1:20:29] Sonatta: glass is nice NODDERS
[1:20:35] yrvengalied: good idea
[1:20:36] ProxyClouds: #ad
[1:20:39] DoctorJohn: OOOO steam deck customization
[1:20:41] Rawrsong: Killswitch, the infamous halo killer PepeLaugh
[1:20:57] afreak10: stalkers use them
[1:21:00] nKoalaBear: no
[1:21:01] CriddleCakes: It is horrifying.
[1:21:03] Estegard: Yep
[1:21:04] GrateWhiteDope: A what?
[1:21:06] JBfromAccounting: yep, shits insane
[1:21:06] MattiaV96: but they are so useful...
[1:21:06] MesquiteBear: yup
[1:21:07] Monchenjiners23: yea
[1:21:07] Trumpetmcool: ?
[1:21:07] Gellar09: the pairing shit
[1:21:09] NoorElBahrain: no
[1:21:09] Notenoughcoffee: i saw the one they used to stalk a woman
[1:21:10] Haeher: stalker time monkaW
[1:21:11] Collected1: Apple addressed a lot of that with detection stuff on iPhones
[1:21:11] Scrince: If anyone would have thought of it before....
[1:21:11] Naneth: did you see the tom scott video? its scary accurate
[1:21:12] Braideraid: whats an air tag
[1:21:14] Nikhxs: What is air tags?
[1:21:14] asadachi99: car thievs use em
[1:21:15] BlazeRom: oh..
[1:21:16] Rawrsong: Oh, as soon as I heard they were giving trackers to the general public I knew bad actors would be using htem
[1:21:19] NoorElBahrain: oh no
[1:21:22] afreak10: @Braideraid GPS tag apple created
[1:21:22] bearclaw34: zeke said something about mail
[1:21:24] JBfromAccounting: it's affordable tracking devices, it's fucking insane
[1:21:29] Angelos_42: Those kind of things already existed, but this one can actually warn you. But yeah, it is never perfect
[1:21:29] freaktechnik: (get AirGuard on android)
[1:21:31] magicmike_in_the_pants: have u seen the video of tom scott test out the air tags stalking? its really entertaining
[1:21:33] Nikhxs: Nikhxs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[1:21:33] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Nikhxs! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[1:21:37] JustVims: That's been going on for a while
[1:21:41] DoctorJohn: jeez that's fucked up
[1:21:44] Hemry64_: Wait I thought they implemented a system to prevent that?
[1:21:45] Trumpetmcool: oof
[1:21:47] DoctorJohn: we have them on our animal collars
[1:21:49] Scojan: Shit... I fear for females if that is happening
[1:21:51] MartymusPrime95: Are they big tags??
[1:21:52] hkharp: Or they will hit them on cars.
[1:21:53] RandomizedRaccoon: I put air tags on all of my bikes and i really wouldn’t want to miss them for that
[1:21:57] DrTazerFace: So this is how I’ll find my favourite streamer :) Kappa
[1:21:59] Collected1: if you have an iPhone it will immediately tell you now that theres one near by
[1:22:01] ShockuhZuluu: Happened to my car
[1:22:01] its__fil: @klitz2013 Apple's tiny wireless beacon that you're supposed to put on your keyring, put in your purse, etc. to track using your phone. Unfortunately because of the way it's designed, it can be used by adversaries to track people without them knowing
[1:22:03] JustVims: nah they released a app that let's you know if there's a air tag near you for prolonged period
[1:22:10] afreak10: yes
[1:22:11] afreak10: there is
[1:22:15] GrateWhiteDope: @Avalier oh
[1:22:15] Angelos_42: there is an android app
[1:22:19] Trumpetmcool: that's nice
[1:22:20] Xenflux: @itmeJP the Android app is one you have to run manually
[1:22:21] Rawrsong: @MartymusPrime95  a bit bigger than a quarter
[1:22:22] WDForty: they never wanted to release an android app, but this thing forced them to
[1:22:25] Xenflux: so it's useless
[1:22:27] Haeher: @Nikhxs little discs from apple that have gps people can track you with those anywhere they use other apple devices in range to treack their location its kinda fucked
[1:22:28] 00_Exia94: people are shit, color me surprised..
[1:22:32] Kaleith: there's an android app but you'd need to know about the issue going out of your way to install it
[1:22:32] Mrshilka: because humans Jp
[1:22:35] Mr_Perril: whats the app for Android??
[1:22:35] CriddleCakes: Did you say that is an app or something implemented into the phone?
[1:22:37] CanadianRM4: !KH3
[1:22:37] itmeBOT: JP will be returning to Kingdom Hearts III to play the DLC for the first time (after 100%ing the base game at launch) on Thursday, April 14th!
[1:22:41] Duckybeard: I use an AirTag on my dogs collar. I love it.
[1:22:43] BlazeRom: it sucks, can't really blame Apple for this, people just suck
[1:22:43] crimson_calamity: they do it to streamers to i've heard. send package to po boxes, then the streamer takes them home, address gets revealed
[1:22:45] Yohhakkai: hm
[1:22:46] Yozki: dude air tags are super helpful, but yes there's stuff to figure out
[1:22:51] ritchie313: the airtag is nice for keys and when you need to remember where stuff are
[1:22:52] WDForty: even with those warnings tho, it can take hours before the warning happens
[1:22:53] Notenoughcoffee: yeah some girl found one glued on her car
[1:22:59] MattiaV96: If I had the money I'd have a air tag for literally everything I own
[1:23:01] DoctorJohn: yeah this is gonna need legislation
[1:23:04] CriddleCakes: Sorry I meant the alert that notifies you of an airtag near you.
[1:23:06] mky404: @duckybeard that’s what normal people use it for! Sadly there’s some fucked up people
[1:23:07] Trumpetmcool: FailFish
[1:23:08] Ebra: yikes
[1:23:08] Rawrsong: Imagine those spy movies and cartoons where you see someone using a tracking dart
[1:23:11] Lysara11: people used these things for years, it's just with AirTags people are finding out how common it is
[1:23:11] DoctorJohn: absolutely gonna need legislation, sorry libertarians
[1:23:11] BublegunPrincess: Oh my god. I've just noticed that huge mouse pad ijpHAPPY
[1:23:15] Xenflux: @BlazeRom you can blame Apple for monetizing the locations of everyone who's bought an iPhone to sell these devices
[1:23:19] SgtStruthers: Good to put on expensive dirt bikes when you got asshole redneck neighbors who like to steal shit out your yard
[1:23:19] poooookey: streamers that have po boxes to stay anonymous get them
[1:23:20] AnorienNightwish: ijpONO
[1:23:24] ReginaldXIV: This was a big problem in the vtuber world a couple years ago
[1:23:26] Angelos_42: Yeah, devices like that already existed, but these can warn you. I hate that any variation of it exists, apple or not.
[1:23:33] DrTazerFace: The idea isn’t even new or specific to Apple. I used Tile for yrs now
[1:23:35] Trumpetmcool: oh wow, people can be investigators now
[1:23:35] SchnellBier: no idea how anyone thought this is a good idea
[1:23:41] afreak10: monkaW
[1:23:46] NoorElBahrain: wow...
[1:23:47] MartymusPrime95: coxWha
[1:23:50] rosemon5001: yo thats fucked
[1:23:52] BlazeRom: @Xenflux wait, anyone can see the trackers ?
[1:23:52] Haeher: my god
[1:23:52] altizar: They fit nicely behind a license plate
[1:23:55] afreak10: oh god that's scary
[1:23:55] Trumpetmcool: O _ O
[1:23:55] DoctorJohn: well
[1:23:57] Haeher: monkaSHAKE
[1:23:57] Estegard: Yah, I member that
[1:23:59] JMansell: Tom Scott did a video recently about AirTag stalking, conclusion was that if you weren't aware of the Tag it would be easy to track anything
[1:23:59] DoctorJohn: that's fucking scary
[1:23:59] GunzGames: Air Tag is the cheapest alternative to easily track some one, so much so  that police have started using them in investigations.
[1:23:59] NoorElBahrain: people are awful
[1:24:02] Bearyman: good grief
[1:24:04] ArgentEsper: There have been positive and negative stories, but it generally seems net negative. Sadge
[1:24:05] mky404: Oh shit I remember Zeke warning about that
[1:24:13] KDRushby: what is the original purpose of it
[1:24:19] GassyMexican: That’s why if I get anything now from a P.O. Box I thoroughly check the entire box
[1:24:23] ritchie313: why are people so creepy
[1:24:23] AinzN: Now I'll never be able to send JP the crocheted Lou T I've made! ijpSAD
[1:24:24] BlazeRom: @KDRushby to track your stuff, like keys and what not
[1:24:24] GassyMexican: And open it up at the place
[1:24:26] MattiaV96: @KDRushby tracking your own stuff
[1:24:31] Mrshilka: @KDRushby finding lost stuff
[1:24:31] Kaleith: @KDRushby tracking your stuff, like a backpack, your keys, whatever
[1:24:35] BlazeRom: good
[1:24:35] TheErad: tppowerAIYIYI
[1:24:37] Mr_Perril: the app is "Tracker Detect" on Google Play, made by Apple :)
[1:24:38] Vili_Borrson: Real dumb Apple didn't expect people to abuse it
[1:24:41] CriddleCakes: Horrifying.. just another anxiety inducer when going out into public.
[1:24:45] Yohhakkai: did jp saw mythforce yet? didnt get an answer sadly
[1:24:47] BearLorde: I mean there have been trackers before AirTag that don't tell you at all if its tracking you.
[1:24:54] Sprengkobold: way safer do to throne or something like that isnt it
[1:24:54] GraveSalad: yea, PO boxes aren't worth it unless you work from a studio or something
[1:24:59] Xenflux: @Mr_Perril it's not real-time detection, last I checked
[1:25:00] Vili_Borrson: True
[1:25:02] MattiaV96: there are apps both on iOS and Android to detect air tags
[1:25:05] afreak10: most tech can be abused , go figure
[1:25:10] freaktechnik: they copied an existing product, apple doing it just made its attack suface much better
[1:25:11] SchnellBier: well apple doesn't really care if they abuse it as long as they buy it
[1:25:13] Nickonil: yeah :( po-box sounds like inviting crazy these days :( not worth
[1:25:14] magicmike_in_the_pants: in pursuit of great they failed to do good KEKW
[1:25:15] Angelos_42: mythforce is a coop game
[1:25:15] MattiaV96: @afreak10 literally every tech
[1:25:17] Yohhakkai: game on egs
[1:25:17] Mr_Perril: @Mr_Perril no you gotta run it urself
[1:25:22] DrTazerFace: There’s been gps trackers for YEARS before Apple made one
[1:25:24] DoctorJohn: I gotta warn some of my streamer friends about this who have faced stalkers
[1:25:36] NoorElBahrain: DoctorJohn ijpSAD
[1:25:41] TongyOne: when the internet was created, who anticipated how such a great tech would be abused
[1:25:41] CriddleCakes: D:
[1:25:45] Mrshilka: chat humans invent a new tech we ask ourselves 2 things, how can I use it to get off and how can I use it to kill other someoone else
[1:25:46] NeonFlux: I have one on motorbike phones me if bike moves without the keyfob
[1:25:48] BaldurCZ: widepeepoHappy Paissa
[1:25:50] yrvengalied: ijpKEK
[1:25:50] GameOnlyNoTalk: How’s the pillow
[1:25:52] NoorElBahrain: DoctorJohn I just feel sad reading that
[1:25:53] Xenflux: @Mr_Perril right, so it's unreasonable to ask Android users to download an app and run it manually periodically just to see if they're being tracked
[1:25:53] AinzN: I would say surprised Zeke still uses a PO Box but then I remembered it's Zeke no one wants to stalk his house zekeKEK
[1:26:05] NPSJason: blaming the company takes agency away from the terrible people who do this crap
[1:26:06] Bob__Z: It just shows that apple exists in its own reality
[1:26:08] Stoffy1: Tile has been around for a long time
[1:26:09] rosemon5001: @Mrshilka NODDERS
[1:26:12] Yohhakkai: https://youtu.be/BoaNQ6hY7gc << mythforce
[1:26:17] DoctorJohn: @noorelbahrain yeah. and they're all female, surprise
[1:26:18] WDForty: apple isn't fully to blame, but they do carry some burdon
[1:26:27] Zeltoo: airtags dont stalk people, people do!
[1:26:27] GraveSalad: apple isn't to blame, RFID tech is old, they maybe just didn't have to put fanfare behind it
[1:26:30] Vili_Borrson: @WDForty ijpNODDERS
[1:26:31] NoorElBahrain: DoctorJohn ijpCRY
[1:26:34] ayethin: @dontcarebear1983 but who makes the tech gwiseHmm
[1:26:37] magicmike_in_the_pants: are we still reacting?
[1:26:49] AltraWolf: Anno 1800 is on sale!
[1:26:50] Archangel3003: I saw that earlier, looks awesome
[1:26:54] DoctorJohn: oh my God
[1:26:56] Archangel3003: That Mythforce game
[1:26:57] WDForty: what happened this time?
[1:26:59] afreak10: monkaW
[1:26:59] Ceaseless_: which one
[1:27:00] DoctorJohn: dude i was no Newsom fan but
[1:27:00] Vili_Borrson: @AltraWolf zekePOG
[1:27:01] Sonatta: Blizzard story? PauseChamp
[1:27:05] Pvt_Shockturion: Just did yea pure monka
[1:27:05] DoctorJohn: Holy shit
[1:27:06] ZcottD: more blizzard?
[1:27:06] Rawrsong: This is similar to the argument about gun manufacturers being responsible for murders
[1:27:07] BaldurCZ: Crungo
[1:27:08] yrvengalied: did you see the 6 min gameplay for the pinochio souls like game JP @itmeJP
[1:27:08] izzyiv: COPIUM  gimme the news JP
[1:27:10] Estegard: The California Governor one? @itmeJP
[1:27:15] mky404: You gonna play the new poe league @itmejp
[1:27:17] NoorElBahrain: No spoilers. I get my news just from JPNN
[1:27:18] Kaleith: @GraveSalad it's gps and bluetooth low energy, it has nothing to do with rfid
[1:27:24] Zaelsus: Also, people will always find a nefarious way to use something innocent, fun or useful. Remember the 3DS photo share feature that was removed because people were sending nudes (and/or other dodgy content) to random people/kids
[1:27:25] Gorn_Vernaleer: yea, Anno DLC launched today
[1:27:26] JBfromAccounting: Newsome possibly meddling in the case... GOOD TIMES
[1:27:27] DrTazerFace: @rawrsong good point
[1:27:35] ploki122: @Yohhakkai So it's just a regular ARPG?
[1:27:36] DoctorJohn: OK don't open Twitter
[1:27:39] KDRushby: i read the news about it but didnt understand it, was the governor being paid to stop it?
[1:27:41] DoctorJohn: close eyes and ears until JPNN
[1:27:42] NoorElBahrain: ijpSPOILER
[1:27:47] NeonFlux: worse than breast milk gate lol
[1:27:49] altizar: blizzard game company or bliazzard snow storm?
[1:27:52] ritchie313: if @itmeJP didnt report it i didnt hear about it rofl
[1:27:53] Collected1: if anyone is into it, BlizzCon looks like it's on this year based on the con center calendar and some emails hotels sent out
[1:27:54] GrateWhiteDope: Pog D2R Tomorrow
[1:27:57] ploki122: When's next POE league? Like 3-4 weeks?
[1:28:05] DoctorJohn: not games related but they finally caught that NYC subway shooter
[1:28:08] JBfromAccounting: @altizar the company LUL

[1:28:15] GrateWhiteDope: big update
[1:28:19] Archangel3003: Whatever happened to that Iron Heart game?? They showed it, it died off a bit, then they started showing more of it and... just remembered it's a thing

[1:28:42] altizar: @JBfromAccounting I mean they're a blizaard snow storm in the news right now too :)
[1:28:45] JBfromAccounting: oh yeahhhhhh... the first true balance patch for it since back in the early 2000s
[1:28:48] Archangel3003: Wait was it Atomic Heart actually
[1:28:48] ploki122: @Yohhakkai Ah!
[1:29:01] ItsNoxid: one where i live
[1:29:06] JBfromAccounting: @itmejp  check the radar LUL
[1:29:06] prfella: @ayethin apple didnt invent rfid tech LUL

[1:29:38] ayethin: @prfella apple made everything Kappa
[1:29:43] macintoshID: Getting snow right now. Has been cold here for 3 days.
[1:29:43] ultimateannihil8r: I am in Kansas and it is somewhat snowing here as a cold front is moving through.

[1:29:59] altizar: Nothern plains
[1:30:04] ItsNoxid: @ploki122 lol whats the 2nd? AB or Quebec?
[1:30:06] iilu: I can't wait for it to stop being so cold so I can complain about it being too hot
[1:30:18] ploki122: @ploki122 I think Alberta's more hated than us, yeah...
[1:30:19] NoorElBahrain: you are at 30F and I am at 30C

[1:31:05] DoctorJohn: I was about to say, a fever is 38
[1:31:06] Vili_Borrson: ijpDEAL @AinzN
[1:31:17] ploki122: 30 dry vs "feels like 30" is a massive difference...
[1:31:29] ploki122: because 30 dry can easily turn into "feels like 42"
[1:31:30] Redvelvet84: 30c is way too hot.
[1:31:33] Vili_Borrson: I like the cold so 86 is hot zaqLUL
[1:31:33] scooterjr37: Is it a dry 86?
[1:31:33] ShockuhZuluu: Melt my poor Canadian soul
[1:32:33] Miros__: I've been in 45 dry, and 30 wet. I'd take the 45 every time.
[1:32:50] ploki122: I'd take a nice semi-humid 20C personally...
[1:33:01] ploki122: If we get to choose, I definitely won't take 30s :P

[1:49:20] asadachi99: shitty AI
[1:49:20] Yohhakkai: that came out today didnt it?
[1:49:22] Notenoughcoffee: people hated the cards i think
[1:49:23] SirSabza: Too similar to L4D which is a dying genre anyway
[1:49:26] ElSpartin: the specials arent fun and the ai is bad
[1:49:27] The_420_Dwarf: I feel like L4D2 Was better
[1:49:30] thatguyuknow985: PvP mode wasn't great
[1:49:31] The_420_Dwarf: Or Vermintide
[1:49:31] DoctorJohn: @itmejp i still play it sometimes, I think just a lot of other games came out
[1:49:32] WDForty: they cards were alright
[1:49:37] The_Shift_Key: Level design was boring
[1:49:38] DoctorJohn: they have improved it a lot in the last few months
[1:49:43] BlazeRom: to me it just felt like another L4D game
[1:49:45] Razzyingraz: I thought cards added variety
[1:49:52] moist_heinous: I blame elden ring
[1:49:53] Darkaros: Deep Rock Galactic kinda overshadowed this game hard with its updates
[1:49:54] BlazeRom: which I know that's what it is, but I guess nothing unique about it
[1:49:55] SirSabza: @BlazeRom that was the whole point i think
[1:50:02] DoctorJohn: I quite liked it
[1:50:08] Zeltoo: i mean im watching the trailer and its not doing much for me
[1:50:16] NeonFlux: it's one of best Co op games at mo tbh
[1:50:16] DoctorJohn: Sam played it a ton when it first came out
[1:50:18] The_Shift_Key: The biggest gripe with this game is not being able to drop attachments
[1:50:24] Zandivya: I saw a video doing a direct comparison with Left for Dead and this is just a straight up worse game.
[1:50:25] asadachi99: the steam reviews for this game are brutal
[1:50:26] Wubsian: I loved this game
[1:50:28] Yohhakkai: @Darkaros newww season and i havent touched it in ages cuz solo no fun
[1:50:39] huemaahn: the card system was so outdated
[1:50:40] rosemon5001: i think people expected it to be wayyy more different than l4d2
[1:50:52] NeonFlux: I was playing last night the tunnels adds hole 4 new acts
[1:51:01] SirSabza: people were passionate about PVP in L4D franchise, this games PVP was not good
[1:51:10] espi: is this DLC?
[1:51:11] DoctorJohn: the steam reviews were bad? I thought they had passed 80 percent positive at one point
[1:51:24] Riot_PhD: I enjoyed the beta a lot but it was something I felt is only good with other people so it is an on sale game for me
[1:51:26] DoctorJohn: yes they added more characters and I think a new map? tons of new cards and such too
[1:51:40] bairdman: Yeah the non l4d pvp turned me away from it
[1:51:44] Gnomeleader213: For me the combat didn't feel satisfying. Melee didnt have the "crunch" that Vermintide 2 had
[1:51:55] Jtbrig1: @itmeJP No mod support, The PVP was bad and the story mode was Meh. It was a odd step back from L4D2
[1:51:57] SirSabza: @DoctorJohn its highest reviews will prob be negative, a lot of bad games get good reviews because to a casual or someone who doesnt care much the games fine, if it was looking to replace L4D its bad
[1:51:58] DoctorJohn: nice!
[1:52:00] Kiratze: Had a lot of fun with the game. But if it wasn't on GamePass I def wouldn't have played it.
[1:52:01] Darkaros: crikJAM Yay

[2:22:20] Ardentfoxx0017: it was like a really long time back like b4 you redid the wall I think
[2:22:23] Zoldaire: Have you tried the new PvP in FF yet @itmeJP ?
[2:22:24] Miros__: @Mrshilka I think that's the width dimention, not the height
[2:22:34] DoctorJohn: I loved ranged
[2:22:36] Theace4434: Is Rise any good? it looks worse then World
[2:22:38] DoctorJohn: I play HBG and LBG
[2:22:44] BaldurCZ: i have noticed im getting less trash from retainers
[2:22:44] tecwa: fastest way to kill monsters as well :D
[2:22:53] DoctorJohn: @theace4434 i played 400+ hours of both! both enjoyable in different ways
[2:22:55] BaldurCZ: after 6.1
[2:22:56] Mrshilka: @Miros__ I was thinking it sitting upright like the Thanos one but maybe yeah
[2:22:57] breadgravy: yeah Rise is AMAZING.
[2:23:06] JonnyFiveO: I've never tried a ranged weapon in MH yet. I might give it a go in Sunbreak.
[2:23:16] DyingEros: I kind of like Rise but worlds realism and slower pace feel good to me
[2:23:17] destiz_: NEW indie ARPG Diablo 2 mix Titan quest clone for eastpunk elements coming tomorrow its called Ghostlore i,m pretty excited for that :)
[2:23:19] Darkaros: I have a PC Bow setup stripCute gonna admit that Rise Bow's controls are a bit jankier than World's since you can't double-bind Sadge
[2:23:20] Muffnar: Rise is better at leveling, worse end game. Hopefully sunbreak fixes that
[2:23:23] BaldurCZ: yeah
[2:23:25] 8mmspikes: Fuck a bom boko
[2:23:36] Theace4434: I played world alot, but dunno something about Rise didn't grab me.

[2:24:22] DyingEros: That Battle Bunny is fuego
[2:24:22] Theace4434: @SmithyUK That's what I noticed.. Just why did they have to downgrade the UI
[2:24:34] breadgravy: yeah what? the base game of MHW at launch was trashed for its endgame, with how limited it was.
[2:24:38] Nickonil: i am starting to get afraid of what i will do with my life after i have gotten this last achivement in elden ring :S hope the DLC's add a lot of content gotten every weapon and every armor piece every spell etc.. just need to get the last ending now

[2:30:02] AinzN: ijpKEK
[2:30:06] destiz_: There was a Kingdom hearts reference to disney+ series that called proud family, one of the Family played the game what looks like kingdom hearts :D
[2:30:09] Darkaros: aros is sora backwards
[2:30:12] DoctorJohn: no way, nobody knows Kingdom Hearts lore its impossible
[2:30:17] breadgravy: @Darkaros OH SHIT

[2:30:30] destiz_: so maybe that mean that we are getting that Disney+ kingdom hearts series soon :)
[2:30:36] BlueSapphyre: @DD_The_Shmey no spoilers!
[2:30:36] ArgentEsper: @DoctorJohn Everyone is either Sora or Xehanort, even you. stripCute

[2:31:22] P0rtilo: @Kyriac really want to know ?
[2:31:35] Archangel3003: @Shoaron Thanks lol
[2:31:38] Kyriac: yes
[2:31:41] breadgravy: Does Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 hold up still gameplay wise?
[2:32:03] ArgentEsper: @breadgravy They're on EGS if you don't mind that. :)
[2:32:11] Kleph78: i believe so
[2:32:11] Lonefellow: 2 is incredible gameplay wise, but only FM and only Critical Mode
[2:32:29] Kyriac: is ventus just sora time traveled and amnesia'ed?
[2:32:30] destiz_: but yea it was kinda weird that they didnt say anything for that Disney+ Anime/animated KH series for the Anniversary event,
[2:32:37] P0rtilo: @Kyriac Basically, Sora has a part of Ventus heart in him... when Sora was born he had that part of him and therefore had some of his traits

[2:54:54] LeroyGankins: is it day one patch stats though?
[2:54:54] Johnny2Cs: Its alays weird on a new patch day
[2:54:57] TheXtractor: nocturne is soo much fun
[2:55:00] LeroyGankins: Stats can be real wonky day 1
[2:55:01] TheXtractor: should give him a go
[2:55:05] LeroyGankins: Yes
[2:55:08] Johnny2Cs: because there are a low amount of games, so if you checked it yesterday the numbers are different
[2:55:11] Johnny2Cs: yesterday
[2:55:13] LeroyGankins: GP buffs
[2:55:21] LoLChivas: they buffed GP
[2:55:22] LeroyGankins: Yone/Yas buffs, Zeri nerfs
[2:55:23] jeffhunter12: wait what
[2:55:24] LoLChivas: so dumb
[2:55:40] Johnny2Cs: yeah idk what psycho buffed yas/yone
[2:55:44] Nightshaft25: nocturne is good yeah
[2:55:46] TheXtractor: nice shiny
[2:55:48] mayosilog: isnt Aurelion Sol the least picked hero?
[2:56:09] Achubra: yas is getting a new 1820 skins so they gotta buff him
[2:56:26] Achubra: 1820RP
[2:56:39] LeroyGankins: 2 weeks
[2:56:42] LeroyGankins: I think
[2:56:44] LoLChivas: @mayo_on_rice depends on the role but asol is one of the lowest mids
[2:56:55] jeffhunter12: gangplank is getting a skin from the ruined king game which is cool
[2:56:58] Johnny2Cs: Also as a side note, OP GG isnt as accurate for low elos (below plat) and trundle is a solid pick in the jungle if your personal WR is so high
[2:57:17] ritchie313: its bout to be a stomp or bots lol
[2:57:34] jeffhunter12: yeah im playing through it at the moment, such a blast

[2:59:21] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:59:26] Delkata: Does she feel any good to play?
[2:59:28] ObeyTheEgg: i dont thin kthat was his name, no
[2:59:47] Johnny2Cs: @Johnny2Cs u.gg is better for filtering low elo. But really stats arent really relevant to lower elos. Improvement in gameplay is going to far outweight any champ differences in gols/silver
[2:59:54] Caedranos: Same Trundle :)

[3:18:33] Shiny_Cony_: Hows it going JP?
[3:18:50] AloeHH: DOes the enemy team have to wait till 2000 to FF?
[3:19:06] Felgrun: They can 15 min ff if everyone agrees
[3:19:12] Felgrun: But I guess they didn't
[3:19:21] epicshoo: jhin just walked around WW OMEGALUL
[3:19:22] the043: WW probably keeping them hostage

[3:19:58] NotYourLad: playing against a fed trundle is genuinely one of the worst feelings in this game
[3:20:05] Felgrun: Bot lane is keeping them hostage is my guess
[3:20:07] NotYourLad: just steals all of your stats with ult and then beats your ass to death
[3:20:11] epicshoo: HYPERCLAP

[3:20:57] NotYourLad: ww with no completed mythic at 20 min monkaS
[3:21:24] epicshoo: FeelsRainMan
[3:21:36] Felgrun: This ww is probably just like a kid havin fun with league
[3:21:46] SirSabza: worst part he didnt even rage, which means he was defeated
[3:21:47] Johnny2Cs: OOF
[3:21:53] Farnzy11: Whats normal for LP gain?
[3:22:03] woofser: He's just a kid who is trying to have fun PepeHands
[3:22:07] Johnny2Cs: around +/- 20
[3:22:08] SirSabza: 23-25 usually
[3:22:09] afreak10: which rank will you be happy in ?
[3:22:14] SirSabza: but 16, if you're high mmr
[3:22:14] Keirby: you feel like you should have gotten more than 13 for that ww?
[3:22:16] BarbedWireShark: 23-25 is super high gains, that is not normal
[3:22:17] NotYourLad: +20ish is the average if you're at your proper rank for your mmr
[3:22:19] EzI091: and you lose like 60 for a loss?
[3:22:22] BarbedWireShark: normal gains are 15-17
[3:22:24] NotYourLad: 17-20
[3:22:34] SirSabza: i've never had an account getting 13-16 O.o
[3:22:37] Johnny2Cs: Yeah Riot REALLY doesnt want you in Gold JP
[3:22:38] epicshoo: so somewhere between 0 - 100 got it PepoG
[3:22:38] SirSabza: other than my main in high mmr
[3:22:40] Farnzy11: twitch chat giving 400 different answers. I am laffin LUL
[3:22:52] LagoutLoud: It used to be that, they reduced it about a year ago when they removed inter division promos
[3:22:59] Narcotical: @Farnzy11 Typical twitch chat tho
[3:23:02] Felgrun: You guys dont get +50 lp every game? lol just play better xd
[3:23:04] Johnny2Cs: @Farnzy11 Its different for everyone based on MMR and elo gains
[3:23:19] Johnny2Cs: So 'normal' isnt really difned
[3:23:23] BarbedWireShark: if u are 50% winrate out of 100 games, 15-17 lp gain is normal
[3:23:26] titanodin: Good afternoon everyone
[3:23:35] Lunar688: back in s3 I got +0LP 2 games in a row, then lost 49lp. that was after a 26game win streak. When the system wants you somewhere it keeps you there
[3:23:38] BarbedWireShark: if u are 55% winrate out of 100, 17-20 are normal etc
[3:23:40] Farnzy11: @Farnzy11 gotcha gotcha. JP getting 13 just seems very low, so wasn't sure how it all worked.
[3:23:58] Yorolek: Wait, then how does it work? The game just randomly decide what rank you should be in and makes your life harder?
[3:24:11] Felgrun: Its been like a month since I last played league and I was just getting matched against challengers on normals
[3:24:35] BarbedWireShark: @Yorolek JP is 51% winrate rn. so if he keeps winning more than he loses, his LP gain will get higher
[3:24:42] Felgrun: I swear Im just gonna play ranked to get matched against silvers like me
[3:24:52] AinzN: Niice!
[3:24:54] crux_58: That's cool
[3:25:00] AinzN: I need some good cookware
[3:25:00] SchnellBier: for a second I thought they announced NFTs
[3:25:03] The_420_Dwarf: Fancy!
[3:25:13] Lazar3t: zippo does something similar for the lighters
[3:25:16] Shiny_Cony_: And here's me using an antique cast iron skillet from the 30's lol
[3:25:17] Felgrun: That sounds real nice
[3:25:35] MostlyHype: how goes the salt farming?
[3:25:40] Cardsharp: wouldn't it be easier just to ship a new one?
[3:25:50] BaldCanadianFather: love me some le creuset
[3:25:50] epicshoo: C-CAW
[3:25:56] 14neo: here @AinzN i'm not using this anymore 🍽️
[3:26:03] The_420_Dwarf: What are they called again? I might get one for my mother.
[3:26:04] titanodin: @14neo o/
[3:26:07] Felgrun: yo holy shit an anivia on silver Pog
[3:26:08] titanodin: @AinzN o/
[3:26:11] 14neo: also @AinzN @titanodin ijpH ijpBOOP
[3:26:16] Yorolek: @BarbedWireShark Oh so its based on winrate. Still seem weird that he loses more then he get on a win
[3:26:22] Tezius: thats damn expensive for cast iron
[3:26:29] AinzN: 14neo titanodin ijpH
[3:26:44] Yorolek: @BarbedWireShark thanks for the info!
[3:26:45] The_420_Dwarf: Thank you!
[3:27:07] titanodin: i wonder fi they fix the rust on other cast iron pans
[3:27:13] BarbedWireShark: @Yorolek not entirely on winrate. a lot comes into play, but can assume since he is 51% and getting 13, he prob goes on win streaks then loss streaks
[3:27:14] Cixah: Cixah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 68 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Have you played any of the new ffxiv patch JP? The pvp is quite fun :)
[3:27:14] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Cixah! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:27:20] BarbedWireShark: which can skew lp gains a lot
[3:27:21] 14neo: D:
[3:27:26] SirSabza: tell me he at least won lane
[3:27:33] heckin_majestic: I had someone steal my red once and say "that's what smite is for" before taking off
[3:27:47] chellooo85: Was playing as Jhin.. jungler wanted a hard leash.. my 4th shot stole it
[3:27:51] epicshoo: ddHuh
[3:27:52] SirSabza: LULW
[3:28:04] 14neo: ijpLAUGH
[3:28:13] ForgetfulOkami: sounds like bronze/silver KEKW
[3:28:26] br4nd0nh347: you should get more LP when that happens
[3:28:39] Shoaron: the higher you climb the more emotional the players will get JP
[3:28:44] Thanator: Moral support
[3:28:48] KyrainMcLeod: moral support is important
[3:28:49] Tezius: those skillets look nice, but not nice enough for the 150 price hike over a lodge. the care they offer is nice though
[3:28:53] 14neo: @Shoaron ijpH ijpBOOP
[3:28:54] SirSabza: @br4nd0nh347 eh, you could somewhat match fix LP doing that by making your friend leave
[3:29:02] Shoaron: @14neo, ijpLOOT
[3:29:17] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:29:47] ghostsofcarcosa: @Shoaron @14neo ijpH
[3:29:54] Shoaron: @ghostsofcarcosa, ijpBOOP
[3:29:57] SirSabza: you saved Yone wave though, so small victory :)
[3:30:08] issalga: how is the jungler life going?
[3:30:46] The_420_Dwarf: Oh yeah im definitely getting a pan from this site for my mother, thanks for the information @itmeJP !
[3:30:59] Felgrun: Glacial augment on anivia seems not worth it
[3:31:02] br4nd0nh347: @sirsabza true, you'd still have to win. If that friend dipped when you are about to win, it won't kick in. it would be for people that leave in the beginning middle of the game
[3:31:38] Ozoaken: you pinged be careful if you want them to help ping assist me
[3:31:41] titanodin: nopw varus is ded
[3:31:42] breadgravy: had to refill my water, what was the skillet brand name?
[3:31:48] titanodin: now
[3:32:05] shemg: sorry gotta go unfreeze my lane so the other team can farm
[3:32:08] Tezius: @breadgravy smithy ironware
[3:32:16] breadgravy: @breadgravy thanks!
[3:32:20] SirSabza: i cant tell is sion is flaming your or just mad, but Sion beats mundo so idk his beef
[3:32:23] Felgrun: Obviously mundo isn't an ez kill cause he's ahead now
[3:32:55] LagoutLoud: she just took your topside
[3:33:05] Felgrun: Qiyana is just 100% bs
[3:33:18] SirSabza: shes took a lot of exp from top sat up there
[3:33:33] shemg: qiyana can carry the whole game
[3:33:43] AinzN: ijpKEK
[3:33:50] Felgrun: Qiyana and Ahri will carry this whole game
[3:33:53] Felgrun: also LUL
[3:33:55] titanodin: sion is good fun
[3:34:00] Keirby: I thought sion was dead for sure
[3:34:02] SirSabza: if yone gets 3 items he can carry we'll see
[3:34:06] Neragsito: mundo missed that knife
[3:34:10] Felgrun: Even sion thought he was that
[3:34:14] titanodin: @Keirby even if he died he would have still killed him
[3:34:14] Felgrun: dead*
[3:34:48] LagoutLoud: nah she bot side free rift too
[3:34:49] BaosilisK: 4 bot LUL
[3:35:18] SirSabza: good W rift is free
[3:35:18] Tezius: nice pillar
[3:35:24] Keirby: very nice e on that
[3:36:11] Felgrun: Your bot lane can kill their bot lane, but qiyana kills literally everyone
[3:36:19] Joebeezer: stun takes 3 q's
[3:36:28] NeosoraAmana: his ults on cooldown you see it bottom right
[3:36:34] Felgrun: 2Q to charge it
[3:36:37] SirSabza: stun? is that new on yone? I thought he just had ult knock up
[3:36:57] LagoutLoud: They are getting camped and not warding
[3:37:03] LagoutLoud: hard to feel bad
[3:37:08] SirSabza: they warded bush tho Kappa
[3:37:28] Farnzy11: i dunno man if I was ganked constantly I would probably play alittle defensive in bot lane LUL
[3:37:32] BaosilisK: ijpPOGGERS
[3:37:35] titanodin: poor mundo
[3:37:36] Tnobuhiko: gift them tower with herald to make up
[3:37:47] Keirby: @Farnzy11 or maybe get some wards out?
[3:37:50] Joebeezer: maybe use herald there?
[3:37:53] SirSabza: they have the perfect botlane to play back from too, both have long poke but they're just skirmishing
[3:38:02] Felgrun: There goes Qiyana again
[3:38:06] Joebeezer: fair enough
[3:38:07] Farnzy11: @Farnzy11 lol anything except what they are doing
[3:38:08] Felgrun: She just gonna R and penta
[3:38:12] Cronopolis: fed quinoa
[3:38:27] woofser: If Qiyana stays bot I bet you can take an inhib with Herald
[3:38:29] Joebeezer: oof
[3:38:29] Tnobuhiko: this varus
[3:38:32] Tnobuhiko: my eyes
[3:38:38] Darble: imagine hitting a skill shot, not that guy
[3:38:41] LagoutLoud: Lol has a trundle with pilar, Raw ults anyway
[3:38:41] Kyriac: missed ult missed q
[3:38:54] Felgrun: Varus do be tiltin
[3:39:07] SirSabza: tbf to varus his Q woulda hit but he got stunned
[3:39:08] Cronopolis: tpanimeYGOddduel
[3:39:13] Felgrun: OH yeah, fun fact, qiyana ult stuns on bush
[3:39:21] Joebeezer: herald gonna run out soon
[3:39:41] titanodin: @Felgrun inside bush right?
[3:40:10] Felgrun: Yeah if you are inside the bush and she ults you, even if you dont hit a wall, it stuns you
[3:40:14] SirSabza: she ulted though, he wasn't gunna do much there with 2 more dashes
[3:40:22] sofa_kingkong: path top sion is the win con here
[3:40:55] SirSabza: what are sions items? wondering if he can run it down yet
[3:41:07] Tnobuhiko: herald
[3:41:10] Tnobuhiko: nwm
[3:41:12] Felgrun: Now he can 100% run it down
[3:41:16] Felgrun: rip heral
[3:41:22] Darkaros: D:
[3:41:25] SirSabza: you didnt get much chance tbh
[3:41:55] woofser: I bet JP and Sion could have taken an inhib with Herald earlier
[3:42:02] Felgrun: He had no ult rip
[3:42:02] SirSabza: his ult wasnt up for that fight, idk why he even went in that early
[3:42:03] titanodin: ez anivia wall
[3:42:11] NeosoraAmana: he didnt have ult again for some reason
[3:42:32] SirSabza: oh hes using his ult for escape thats why
[3:42:56] titanodin: dats a thirsty bird
[3:42:57] Buttzyy: xerath going to ult lol ?
[3:43:29] Felgrun: Anivia do be kinda torrlin

[3:45:04] Felgrun: Meanwhile top lane do be an island
[3:45:05] SirSabza: he doesnt have the items to run it down, he went for damage instead of tank items
[3:45:05] titanodin: dont think he can ignore mundo to get the tower tho

[3:46:34] LagoutLoud: You can actually interrupt samira ult with pillar if you need to
[3:47:02] SirSabza: the longer this game the worse it gets, your carries aren't good enough to carry
[3:47:07] Kalvixish: I mean did you have any doubt, Yas and Yone are both the same, they think they're god cos of their flashy easy to use skills
[3:47:09] Kalvixish: then throw
[3:47:16] titanodin: trundle and sion are the carries
[3:47:42] Felgrun: Varus hit qiyana Pog

[3:48:04] Felgrun: and bot tower is closer
[3:48:16] Kalvixish: I rekon with your ult you could beat mundo 1v1 now
[3:49:23] Cronopolis: spend your dosh before the next fight
[3:49:46] SirSabza: qiyana makes it now but sion should create enough pressure
[3:50:08] Price_FTW: this one looking like a case of tankier team wins. just gotta keep it up
[3:50:11] DagooX: KEKW

[3:53:00] titanodin: @itmeJP any interest in learning a new jungle?
[3:53:04] Kalvixish: late night LoL with work next day is always a risk if it goes pear shaped
[3:53:12] Tezius: Thor 4 trailer theory: yall think theyre delaying it because Gor the god butcher is somehow gonna tie in with moon knight and wreck someone in the egyptian pantheon?

[3:54:59] SirSabza: in this ELO people ALWAYS google counters
[3:55:04] ForgetfulOkami: they're informed they're just bad
[3:55:08] Sonatta: they're trying way too hard
[3:55:15] Infidel_Art: Don't forget that silver is average skill... people aren't dumb here
[3:55:20] Kalvixish: ah ye, that makes sense
[3:55:20] ForgetfulOkami: ya
[3:55:25] shemg: its pretty easy to just google trundle counter
[3:55:29] DyingEros: Silver is average rank I believe in the RM
[3:55:34] Kalvixish: I'm silver as well, I just stick to my good old Hecarim to carry me through and ignore counters
[3:55:39] SirSabza: Silver now is like plat 8 years ago, i've seen people insec leesin in silver lol
[3:55:42] Kalvixish: charge hard enough into anything and its not longer a counter I always say
[3:55:43] wude: silvers can play lane phase but after that its just ????
[3:55:54] Farnzy11: Zyra support. I feel seen POGSLIDE
[3:55:57] Felgrun: Isn't silver like 90% of the playerbase?
[3:56:03] tglenn: but it’s the counter bro
[3:56:09] ForgetfulOkami: idk about 90% but silver is quite a bit
[3:56:09] Kalvixish: I mean ye, in silver closing a game is hard, I can get a good early with ganks to put people ahead, then it drags on another 30 minutes till I'm irrelevent
[3:56:11] The_420_Dwarf: @wude I feel attacked Kappa
[3:56:15] SirSabza: Gold is the highest amount no? Iron has less people than masters
[3:56:21] ForgetfulOkami: yeah iron, bronze, silver combined is like 70%
[3:56:23] Anarrima7: Whats the highest rank youve been?
[3:56:37] SirSabza: In EU there was less people in Iron than there are in masters
[3:56:44] OuroborosChemist: silver mediocre with hints of greatness and whole lot more or absolute of dissaters in terms of performance of each small play in game
[3:56:56] Kalvixish: @SirSabza I can believe that, as you would really need to try and be awful to be in iron
[3:57:22] Goldenkrow: How was playing bot? Curious about that role @itmeJP
[3:57:44] SirSabza: If counters matters massively, one tricks wouldn't be in Challenger
[3:57:47] Infidel_Art: absolutely
[3:57:53] Helix919: Wait I thought you made gold one season?
[3:58:02] Shoaron: thats a good way to put it LUL
[3:58:15] Kalvixish: @SirSabza very true, even champions that aren't good can be 1 tricked to challenge by the best players
[3:58:43] Anarrima7: What nr is this season?
[3:58:48] Kalvixish: good news is the Wukong is probably just trying them out as they got buffed
[3:58:52] SirSabza: 12 i think
[3:58:55] Kalvixish: so probably isn't going to know how to play em
[3:58:58] OuroborosChemist: @SirSabza depends on matchup and skill difference low tier champ vs higher tier thats direct counter sorta slaps you at equal skill level
[3:58:59] Anarrima7: Ahh
[3:58:59] AinzN: I'm been blind running the new Ex Trial raid in FFXIV and my lord it's busy!
[3:59:01] SirSabza: i think he meants which season
[3:59:06] n1rri: Season 21? I think?
[3:59:15] Kalvixish: 22
[3:59:22] Kalvixish: I though it was 22
[3:59:23] Kalvixish: yhang on
[3:59:26] SirSabza: no its 12, League hasnt been out for 22 years
[3:59:27] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[3:59:27] Anarrima7: How many seasons
[3:59:35] Anarrima7: Oh 21
[3:59:43] Shoaron: they started doing 2 ranked seasons a year instead of 1 iirc
[3:59:44] Kalvixish: ah wait
[3:59:47] SirSabza: no its 12, legue hasnt been out since 200 xD
[3:59:52] AinzN: hypeE ADS! hypeE
[3:59:56] Infidel_Art: They just refer to seasons by their year now, they stopped counting. So this is Season 2022
[4:00:02] Kalvixish: I got confused by the emote being the 2022 one
[4:00:02] freaker286: @Shoaron 2 splits, but still one season
[4:00:02] BaosilisK: peepoArrive
[4:00:06] zymioi: teemo bottom ! ijpD ijpWTF
[4:00:13] zymioi: that a thing
[4:00:13] Felgrun: season 12
[4:00:18] SirSabza: i mean yeah its season 2022, but its season 12, patch notes are 12.x
[4:00:23] Felgrun: Just look at the first number in the patch notes
[4:00:30] Shoaron: ah kk
[4:00:36] Shoaron: then yea season 12
[4:01:22] SirSabza: they started 2 resets cus they know game is played the most around rank reset and wanna make money
[4:01:29] PainExpress: is that a yasuo adc?
[4:01:34] zymioi: teemo bottom lane is a thing when did that become a thing ??
[4:01:39] LagoutLoud: Why did they lane swap mid and top?
[4:01:55] SirSabza: Ahri gets dicked on by fizz early
[4:01:56] freaker286: @LagoutLoud they didnt, he picked shen mid and her neeko top
[4:02:33] LagoutLoud: I mean they could be duo and not talk about it in chat, but shen mid against fizz isnt going to get much done either
[4:02:43] Felgrun: Ahri until level 3 absolutely bullies fizz
[4:02:48] Felgrun: Then starts falling off
[4:02:49] BaosilisK: the name was fitting LUL
[4:02:51] SirSabza: Shen in theory is a good against fizz, cus melee vs melee shen dominates early
[4:03:00] LagoutLoud: @Felgrun Its neeko not ahri
[4:03:04] freaker286: @LagoutLoud they talked in chat, neeko asked if shen wanted to swap and he sai dno
[4:03:08] inuakurei: LUL
[4:03:18] Felgrun: @LagoutLoud Same thing
[4:03:28] SirSabza: there are very few pre 6 champs that beat shen in a 1v1 in lane if melee
[4:03:41] Felgrun: Any ranged will bully melee until everyone has their abilites
[4:04:03] Kalvixish: least you got a shen who uses their ult
[4:04:08] Kalvixish: should make things a lot easier

[4:04:27] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Inoyu! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[4:05:43] Kalvixish: nice
[4:05:54] Kalvixish: keeping that fizz on his toes
[4:06:15] SirSabza: yasuo teemo bot lol, seems counter productive
[4:06:24] DobbsjustDobbs: You finishing the 6.1 MSQ later tonight JP?
[4:06:31] numerrik: As you should, jp, that was a pretty good pick
[4:06:38] Kalvixish: yasuo teemo bot seems like the most souless bot duo you could imagine
[4:07:05] Kalvixish: ye your guys aren't realising they should be slowly pulling back so you can gank
[4:07:06] SirSabza: teemo is so item starved i can't imagine him being a support lol
[4:07:25] crux_58: Clap
[4:07:31] Infidel_Art: LUL
[4:07:34] Reijm11: almost got away with it
[4:07:38] Kalvixish: I mean if your team had paid attention it wouldn't have been
[4:07:46] Kalvixish: it was like they didn't notice you had dived em
[4:07:46] Razmeck: Is this a ranked game?
[4:07:51] Infidel_Art: diving is scary
[4:08:00] SirSabza: felt like jinx and zyra gave no input into that gank whatsoever
[4:08:02] NeosoraAmana: you were startled by the red shen ult cause you thought you were low on health
[4:08:06] Infidel_Art: @Razmeck yes
[4:08:24] Kalvixish: @SirSabza yep, that Yas sat there on like no health for so long JP had to go back in again
[4:08:31] numerrik: I mean it was a 2 for 1 and a tower got the kill, not an opponent, could have been worse
[4:08:35] Kalvixish: clearly farming minions is more important than killing yas
[4:09:07] SirSabza: neeko damage looking kinda nutty atm
[4:09:17] Kalvixish: notghin sadder than seeing a flash so completely wasted
[4:09:25] The_Faceless_Void: Jp must of gotten out of smurf que or something his teammates seem to have brains in his games today
[4:09:44] SirSabza: @The_Faceless_Void the last game was full of a couple pepegas
[4:09:47] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:10:16] The_Faceless_Void: @SirSabza oh I must of not been paying attention
[4:10:19] ghostwind32: Wow
[4:10:19] Infidel_Art: Goddamn
[4:10:20] ceilss: Whgy herald top? Why not just go bot and take plates with it ?
[4:10:27] ghostwind32: Incoming resign
[4:11:12] Kalvixish: by the time he got bot plates probably would have been almost done anyway and its handy pushing to an inhib
[4:11:30] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW 5 gold bounties
[4:11:34] The_Faceless_Void: or was it 3
[4:11:34] Kalvixish: further you push a lane further the minions will push it, so hard it is to push it back to your towers
[4:11:36] The_Faceless_Void: either way
[4:12:05] NeosoraAmana: yep but farm was more important then the kill anyway
[4:12:21] NeosoraAmana: 250 gold kill or 650 gold minions
[4:12:29] Kalvixish: I mean at this point I can only imagine how little they are worth for a kill
[4:12:56] Kalvixish: I mean if he went all in ye probably
[4:13:02] Kalvixish: but his spirit was already broken
[4:13:04] absurdiTyyyy: EZ Clap
[4:13:04] Infidel_Art: EZ Clap
[4:13:05] DagooX: greyCR
[4:13:07] Anarrima7: lol
[4:13:07] Notenoughcoffee: Clap
[4:13:08] AinzN: ijpEZ Clap
[4:13:10] inuakurei: EZ Clap
[4:13:13] ghostwind32: That was so lopsided
[4:13:26] ceilss: KEKW dmg
[4:13:30] lzrdou: like 10
[4:13:35] Infidel_Art: Almost silver 2 Pog
[4:13:37] Anarrima7: LP omnomnomnom
[4:13:53] VioletEden: hard to do damage if the enemy team is permanently dead
[4:13:58] Kalvixish: this is something I hate about the LP system
[4:13:59] NeosoraAmana: your MMR is really bad somehow
[4:14:05] ceilss: 20 wins to fix mmr usually
[4:14:08] Kalvixish: it seems so random as to when it decided your MMR has improved
[4:14:12] wude: more games you play the less you get
[4:14:20] stellasayswoofwoof: the mistake is playing ranked in the first place lol
[4:14:51] BaosilisK: the next win will sure do it COPIUM
[4:14:54] NeosoraAmana: the shen knew
[4:14:55] SirSabza: prob wanted to duo
[4:15:05] NeosoraAmana: he was giving u advice like a chatter would all game
[4:15:18] Kalvixish: The worst thing though, is when you go on an 11 win streak, normally an 11 lose streak follows.
[4:15:21] Miros__: what's your overall record on Trundle?
[4:15:24] Infidel_Art: LUL
[4:15:34] NeosoraAmana: why is shaco your ban btw
[4:15:35] Kalvixish: thats what made me quit last time, I noticed everytime I won 10 games, I'd then lose 10 right after
[4:15:46] titanodin: is the new moon knight out today?
[4:16:11] Ozoaken: 34-18 oon trundle
[4:16:15] Infidel_Art: das really good
[4:16:23] Joalni: Every Wednesday @titanodin So yes.
[4:16:43] titanodin: @Joalni does ti have a drop time?
[4:16:46] Anarrima7: man, I really want to play a moba, but everything is so toxic.. feelsbadman
[4:17:05] Kalvixish: @Anarrima7 just mute all and team chat, thats what I do
[4:17:10] sunflower204: aram tend to be less toxic
[4:17:10] Kalvixish: it makes the game much more fun
[4:17:17] Joalni: @titanodin I would think it should be out everywhere. For me it's been 12+ hours.
[4:17:18] EzI091: @Anarrima7 Smite is more chill compared to others mobas
[4:17:23] SirSabza: your account has a 51% winrate so maybe they think you're fine the way you are
[4:17:24] Anarrima7: true true..
[4:17:25] atterberry_: @Anarrima7 I share the same sentiment.
[4:17:29] ForgetfulOkami: @Kalvixish 100% this
[4:17:29] titanodin: @Joalni thx
[4:17:31] Infidel_Art: Yeah any time I play with a Renata it doesn't feel like she does anything
[4:17:32] GrievAY: Silver 3 Lee
[4:18:04] SirSabza: Renata ult is one of the best supp ults in the game
[4:18:07] titanodin: i tend to main a role each season when i started
[4:18:21] Kalvixish: And jungle is the harder one to go to as its so different to lanes, plus so much crap to pay attention to laners have no clue about
[4:18:37] SirSabza: Top is the worst lane to solo queue, you're at the mercy of so much
[4:18:51] Kalvixish: it must be lovely being a laner and just paying attention to your lane and nothing else.
[4:19:06] Friedolf: HypeCry in the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion ganks tonight
[4:19:13] JonnyFiveO: @itmeJP Did you ever figure out your crashing issue when loading in?
[4:19:14] Kalvixish: Yep, as a jungler, you're luck if they stop CSing to help when you gank
[4:19:24] Kalvixish: I've had many ganks fail because the laners kept CSing instead of helping
[4:19:25] ritchie313: good save
[4:19:29] Darkaros: gg go next tinder
[4:19:33] thatguyuknow985: I think the next thing you need to learn for jungle is how to track the enemy jungler.
[4:19:39] LagoutLoud: Swipe right is match Swipe left is not match lol
[4:19:42] sunflower204: Playing jungle also makes you realize how unreasonably mean you were toward your jungle
[4:19:46] titanodin: when i play top my jungle LOVES me i always go to save him from invades
[4:20:14] Kalvixish: @titanodin ye if a laner actually helps me against an invade they have my undying gratitude and ganks for the rest of the game
[4:20:23] ForgetfulOkami: truth
[4:20:34] ghostwind32: The Jungle standard is low. So many bad junglers
[4:20:35] Fynagle: Successfully gank the lane. If they get away then it then they get annoyed.
[4:20:49] Kalvixish: however when somebody is going 0/5 and you rightfully don't gank the now fed enemy they will instantly blame you for it
[4:20:50] SchnellBier: 1 successful gank is half a win already
[4:21:06] sunflower204: I had people blame me for not giving the kills to adc on a succesful gank.
[4:21:09] Anarrima7: isnt that part of the job for a jungle? (noob in lol here)
[4:21:11] thatguyuknow985: You got flash. That
[4:21:19] thatguyuknow985: That's good enough
[4:21:20] SirSabza: its fiora though, so in 4 levels she kills everyone on the map
[4:21:28] Kalvixish: Honestly I think the thing I hate most is losing laners who complain that I don't gank for them
[4:21:37] Infidel_Art: oh no
[4:21:48] Fynagle: It's very difficult to get a player a kill during a gank. Could mean the difference between a kill and them getting away.
[4:21:52] Mud__: UHMM
[4:22:19] Kalvixish: @Fynagle thats why I don't even try, could also result in them getting a kill they wouldn't have otherwise, or backup arriving
[4:22:25] Kalvixish: better off just getting the kill fast as you can and moving on
[4:22:57] Fynagle: @Kalvixish To be fair it depens on comp. If your bot has CC it can make it easier, but people never play/plan for CC at champion select.
[4:23:19] Kalvixish: I mean ye if they get CCd I'll happily leave it for the carry
[4:23:24] Kalvixish: but that is a rare situation
[4:23:52] Fynagle: @Kalvixish Yeah, people generally only hae CC champions primarily so they can get kills.
[4:24:08] Infidel_Art: Nice
[4:24:11] LagoutLoud: That pillar was perfect
[4:24:13] Kalvixish: ye Urgot got 6 as he got 5
[4:24:13] Anarrima7: noice
[4:24:18] Kalvixish: so hopefully he can catch up now
[4:24:46] Kalvixish: I don't think he knows when a supp is meant to roam
[4:25:04] LagoutLoud: no
[4:25:13] thatguyuknow985: No his ult is a kick
[4:26:22] Kalvixish: when ganking mid rather than just going through the river bush, I'd circle around the wall near the tower
[4:26:40] Kalvixish: it put you behind them so they have to run at you or into the river
[4:26:43] ch4ppi2: LUL
[4:27:07] Xinder88: Only one pink ward of your own allowed at a time. You placed a new one so the previous one expires.
[4:27:42] Ozoaken: you pinged be careful. How is your team to understan that that means you want to do the objective?
[4:27:52] DagooX: NOPERS
[4:28:02] Guomi: Not even you? Sadge
[4:28:34] Kalvixish: I'd go help fiora
[4:28:37] Kalvixish: lee will go in
[4:28:59] Kalvixish: could probably go rift now
[4:29:04] Kalvixish: *herald
[4:29:12] 14neo: ijpHMM
[4:29:36] Infidel_Art: no shame in spam pinging more
[4:29:43] Infidel_Art: when team isn't paying attention
[4:30:03] Kalvixish: careful lee was top
[4:30:18] Anarrima7: ez clap
[4:30:49] Kalvixish: repeat gank!
[4:30:55] crux_58: Clap
[4:30:57] ghostwind32: lol
[4:30:57] Narcotical: Nice pillar placement
[4:31:01] Infidel_Art: Pog
[4:31:03] Anarrima7: woops
[4:31:06] Kalvixish: Thats another important thing to learn as jungle, repeat gank a lane until you tilt them
[4:31:10] Fynagle: The "try to force an FF" win, a classic.
[4:31:17] iceco1d_tv: the gromp greed paid off
[4:31:52] Ozoaken: for fiora under top tower
[4:31:53] sunflower204: that's for fiora I think
[4:31:54] Kalvixish: annoyingly I think he was actually aiming at Fiora
[4:31:56] Miros__: oh god... a max slow Ashe build is irritating AF

[4:32:46] sunflower204: ashe is so easy to gank
[4:32:48] iceco1d_tv: master troll
[4:32:48] Kalvixish: make that Urgot regret he ever loaded this game
[4:32:49] Mud__: peepoClap
[4:33:23] Fynagle: Uh oh, can't let them get bounty gold. That's what turns the game.
[4:33:39] iceco1d_tv: he got up and walked away
[4:33:41] Narcotical: This Urgot must be so mad
[4:33:41] Kalvixish: ok I think you'll tilt that Urgot soon :P

[4:36:39] Kalvixish: I swear that Ashe has turned off their mini map and is playing with the volume off
[4:37:22] titanodin: @itmeJP try letting ashe know your coming next time just too see if she gets away next time LUL
[4:37:42] sunflower204: not if you ult him
[4:37:42] Kalvixish: I mean they killed a dragon right next to her, what else is he meant to do

[4:38:31] Ozoaken: LUL lee just save her with his kick
[4:38:45] GrievAY: But this is why you don’t play Lee Sin in silver (if u want to climb). The player piloting Lee doesn’t have a clue what he is doing or how to play the champ
[4:38:47] Kalvixish: 2 towers I rekon for this
[4:38:57] bronze_aged: bonk bonk bonk bonk

[4:40:48] Infidel_Art: Imagine how tilted the enemies will be after a game like this
[4:40:50] Kalvixish: This honestly feels like the Urgot and Ashe at least are iron
[4:41:01] P0rtilo: Mad respect to that Fiora, who died 2 times in 30 sec and still managed to win her lane HARD
[4:41:05] Senlikin: 30 - 6 senlikLUL

[4:42:18] Felgrun: You are winning too much
[4:42:24] Razmeck: The games I see @itmeJP playing today really makes me question what type of SOLOQ bots is JP playing with
[4:42:34] DoctorJohn: did we break the win streak?
[4:42:45] Kalvixish: You're playing jungle now dude, you don't get honours for carrying games
[4:42:45] Fynagle: Only time I ever see mulitple honors is almost always top.
[4:42:51] Kalvixish: you get told you did your job and thats it
[4:42:54] DoctorJohn: damn nice
[4:43:18] titanodin: @itmeJP you might skip a rank with that big of a win streak
[4:43:31] bogidude17: Is Autofill the thing that makes you sometimes get bot lane?
[4:43:38] Kalvixish: I mean you'd hope, but I think its bsaed onMMR not win streak

[4:44:36] Kalvixish: I don't know if its cos I'm old or what, but I don't get why people spend money on those things
[4:44:57] SchnellBier: there is no reason
[4:45:02] Guomi: Rich idiots like those who pay 3 million for original.... is Rembrandt that cheap?
[4:45:02] afreak10: KEKW

[4:46:22] 14neo: @Guomi yikes ijpMONKA
[4:46:30] SchnellBier: we should support NFTs by selling them to rich people NODDERS
[4:46:46] titanodin: just ban set now and tilt them
[4:46:51] Anarrima7: set?
[4:46:53] Felgrun: why the fuck do people buy NFT
[4:46:54] drewmud: There's a reason Mayweather is the highest paid athlete of the last decade
[4:46:56] Guomi: The richest thing I heard of him was buying maybe only copy of mint-grade concept Pikachu, and wearing that to UFC or WWE match
[4:46:59] Felgrun: just guy a painting or some shit
[4:47:14] Guomi: Paintings are all taken by now basically

[4:49:42] lordofchaos: chat I was thinking of coming back to play FFXIV  and it seem like there better content for free in the trial then just paying for my old account? any have links pro and cons
[4:49:53] Hopsinka: lol
[4:49:55] W_Tile: the you have won enough queue
[4:49:58] DobbsjustDobbs: 10
[4:49:59] The_420_Dwarf: Maybe its one of those literal names
[4:50:01] DobbsjustDobbs: THere's 9 others
[4:50:01] titanodin: FAKER POG
[4:50:05] Hopsinka: jp quit lost ark chat?
[4:50:06] scooterjr37: dont disrimiate onm crackheads JP
[4:50:16] scooterjr37: discrimiate also
[4:50:25] Guomi: Well you have usual limitations on free trial as anywhere else
[4:50:27] Strivus: You cant sign up for the trial under the same email if you had played before
[4:50:29] Tremert: They are finding the most toxic people on your team so you can have equal fun and anger xD, Is part of the experience, too much fun already xD
[4:50:30] Guomi: Anti-botting measures
[4:50:38] valh411a: Did you know that the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV has a free trial, and includes the entirety of A Realm Reborn AND the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions on playtime? Sign up, and enjoy Eorzea today! Kappa
[4:50:39] heckin_majestic: could roll new char on old acct and still play the free part I think, unless they changed it
[4:50:41] lordofchaos: I played back in 2015 so no xpac and I had lvl 50 pally/summoner/scholar
[4:51:00] Guomi: Once you pay on a service account, you pay forever
[4:51:10] W_Tile: if you are at 50 I say just play fromj there
[4:51:32] Kalvixish: I tried playing FF14, but I finished the starter quests in the first area, then wasn't sure what to do besides the starter quests in the other starting areas
[4:51:48] Kalvixish: but they don't scale up so it felt like it'd be a case of clearing up super easy quests for house keeping sake
[4:52:04] JonnyFiveO: It took me I think about 60 hours to go through ARR a few months ago mainlining the story.
[4:52:14] cjk83: The new duty support will help with avoiding queue times
[4:52:16] Irvatar: But you don't need to pay a sub for the time you play on free trial but you also can't join guilds/fc
[4:52:23] Kultak: I wouldn't start over from 50
[4:52:28] Guomi: The anti-botting/scamming measures
[4:52:32] titanodin: there team has low HP
[4:52:34] ghostwind32: I just followed the MSQ expansion by expansion. There are easy charts to follow online
[4:52:35] lordofchaos: that pretty dive heavy team
[4:52:39] shemg: wukong jungle
[4:52:45] JWoody82: sona stronk
[4:53:04] Kalvixish: they are basically all AD though
[4:53:14] Kalvixish: so you can stack armour here and win easily
[4:53:33] lordofchaos: ok thanks for advice ItmeJP ya im playing agian and 2 friends are playing for first time
[4:53:33] notlongtillDawn: Then again there is a reason why the trail includes HW. It's a bit of a slow burn.
[4:53:45] OdinX1: doesnt kaisa do % health magic damage tho?
[4:53:48] Infidel_Art: Kai'Sa is 100% building AP
[4:53:57] WantedOne: dont forget the 10 lol
[4:54:10] Irvatar: But you can't create parties on your own
[4:54:11] lordofchaos: yep
[4:54:13] Kalvixish: ah is she? I just always assume carries are more AA based
[4:54:13] W_Tile: also friends make everything 100% better
[4:54:31] OdinX1: THere are lots of helpful people who will make you a party and then leave it
[4:54:39] OdinX1: Ive helped several people /shouting in gridania do it
[4:54:43] Guomi: You do need someone to organize it, a sub player
[4:54:45] BaosilisK: oh ye can't talk and can't create parties ijpSAD
[4:54:48] Kalvixish: well Kai'Sa is kinda split of AD and AP, so armour will still do work
[4:54:52] synthetik666: im looking forward to playin Evil Dead and The Quarry with friends
[4:55:10] Irvatar: @OdinX1 true, but its also annoying every time you have to leave because of a solo duty
[4:55:31] W_Tile: it was a thing
[4:55:35] Infidel_Art: YEP
[4:55:36] TheHeirofYork: in silver it is
[4:55:36] W_Tile: idk ab out now
[4:55:49] br4nd0nh347: neeko ad is a thing and it was realyl bad back in the day
[4:55:50] Infidel_Art: It's a thing in all ranks
[4:56:00] Narcotical: You already had top, mid and jungle AD though so I guess it's not too bad of a choice to go AP bot
[4:56:12] W_Tile: ah sound logic
[4:56:33] lordofchaos: is bot lane a duo maybe?
[4:56:35] Infidel_Art: They're nerfing some ADC items next patch too so classical ADCs are gonna get even more unpopular
[4:57:00] Kalvixish: you'll probably be ganking top and mid most this game
[4:57:06] Kalvixish: Vel Koz is just guna be perma pushed in
[4:57:14] jeffhunter12: vel koz getting fed is so cruel
[4:57:52] Kalvixish: giving you double crab I guess
[4:58:05] Ozoaken: first crab isnt worth fighting over
[4:58:18] Lodba: can i ask somthing ?
[4:58:29] Lodba: what is the point of asmr on twitch ?
[4:58:37] synthetik666: shes a super freak, super freak
[4:58:44] Theagent203: it looked like jp used that pillar to deny urgot the kill LOL
[4:58:53] jeffhunter12: it did lol
[4:59:12] jeffhunter12: ijpSMUG
[4:59:32] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[4:59:33] sunflower204: urgot probably could've kill yone by himself with that flip
[4:59:47] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[4:59:52] Justice98405: I have a question about resubbing with a Prime thing. Last month was my first time ever so how do I 'properly' resub to this channel later this month? Wait for the final day and it'll let me do it again or do I have to wait for it to lapse?
[5:00:20] Justice98405: Last day is the 22nd or so I think.
[5:00:27] Dredstryde: @Justice98405 Should be able to do it on the final day
[5:00:31] bairdman: @Justice98405 youll get a notice when your prime is ready to use again
[5:00:44] bairdman: ijpHI
[5:00:49] Justice98405: Okay cool.
[5:01:08] Justice98405: thanks @dredstryde and @bairdman
[5:01:24] Justice98405: I'm new to this and don't wanna mess it up. lol
[5:01:45] Feeos: the day it falls off you gotta wait a certain amt of time then it pops up to use again
[5:02:42] Justice98405: good to know @feeos
[5:02:47] Kalvixish: thats the best person you could give it to
[5:02:57] Kalvixish: you don't wanna give it ti a laner
[5:03:05] Eyeofthehawks: Doesn't matter how easy it is if you eat crayons
[5:03:18] Kalvixish: leave it, you cant sotp em
[5:03:22] Phreams: if you dont know proper spacing its hard because you get perma attacked
[5:03:34] TelosVelox: niceeee
[5:04:05] Lodba: you could havw 2 vs 1 but you went on herald
[5:04:22] TGOTPC: they got herald
[5:04:22] Lodba: no
[5:04:26] WantedOne: they got the herald
[5:04:29] Kalvixish: Yone got the last hit
[5:04:31] Lodba: you dident kill it
[5:04:32] AinzN: You didn't get last hit on it
[5:04:33] WantedOne: you were a few hp off
[5:04:34] Eyeofthehawks: You didnt get it, it popped with an assist on you
[5:05:07] Kalvixish: you can regank in a min though now his flash is gone
[5:05:59] Kalvixish: gah this gank aint guna happen
[5:06:09] Kalvixish: oh...
[5:06:13] Kalvixish: well unless that Yone does that
[5:06:19] sunflower204: that yone made a really dumb move
[5:06:30] Infidel_Art: that's a huge early tower
[5:06:44] Kalvixish: ye that Yone should have been away easily, but he decided to suicide
[5:06:54] Justice98405: Not to encourage JP but I kinda like watching League because I just zone out and read chat or listen to JP since I don't 'know' League worth anything. lol
[5:06:58] Infidel_Art: how does irelia have so little damage lol
[5:07:06] Kalvixish: I get the feeling this Irelia just finished a game where she got fed
[5:07:13] Kalvixish: and now she's playing like shes an end-game fed irelia
[5:07:23] P0rtilo: She has a 2 lvl gap... and complains
[5:07:31] AinzN: @Justice98405 that's the best way to enjoy League
[5:08:05] Justice98405: @ainzn maybe the only true way to enjoy it? 😆
[5:08:29] TheKushMinister: there is one thing i fear most in this game, and thats trundle in the yungle
[5:08:34] breadgravy: @Kalvixish yeah their last game they went 24/4/7
[5:09:04] Kalvixish: if you hang around top you can get the next herald
[5:09:26] Fynagle: He knew what was up/
[5:10:20] Eyeofthehawks: After Wu was behind you it was just a matter of time
[5:10:20] Kalvixish: sometimes it's better to just leave a tower to die
[5:10:47] TheKushMinister: your vel wasnt prioritizing correctly and missed some things, couldve been a good turn
[5:11:18] JWoody82: by 16 mins, that sona's buttons are going to start having pretty, pretty short cooldowns
[5:11:51] Kalvixish: drake
[5:11:52] crux_58: Clap
[5:12:02] sunflower204: no idea why they chase him lol
[5:12:37] Infidel_Art: well hey drake
[5:12:41] sunflower204: well 1 for 1 not bad
[5:12:46] Fynagle: Irelia doing Irelia things.
[5:12:55] WantedOne: @sunflower204 also gave an assist
[5:13:05] Kalvixish: I mean shes not exactly being helpful, but at least slowly getting kills will feed her
[5:13:06] Lodba: trading when you are behind is good
[5:13:10] Kalvixish: and eventually she can't help but be useful
[5:13:32] inuakurei: KEKW
[5:13:45] Fynagle: Someone's grabbed a shot-put.
[5:13:45] Kalvixish: and urgot is just heralding while they take mid
[5:14:10] Kalvixish: I mean Urgot even said he was going herald
[5:14:17] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[5:14:20] Kalvixish: ye he should have stopped and come help, but he actively said what he was done
[5:14:22] WantedOne: "im going to go rift" "wait, you werent flanking?!" the heck
[5:14:30] Kalvixish: ye thats game sadly
[5:14:42] Kalvixish: actually
[5:14:47] Kalvixish: I think just enough of em died for it not to end just yet
[5:14:53] Kalvixish: but oof, it's going ot be tough
[5:14:57] TheKushMinister: kraken slayer neeko
[5:15:03] TheKushMinister: i have truly seen it all
[5:15:23] TheKushMinister: how to render neekos abilities useless 101
[5:15:39] Kalvixish: ye that Irelia will be useful in the late game
[5:15:41] woofser: COPIUM
[5:15:45] Kalvixish: she just needs time to very slowly get there
[5:15:51] Lodba: late game you lose kaisa can kill you all whit ofscreen w
[5:15:53] Genostar0: get the urgot fed and he will carry
[5:15:56] Kalvixish: Vel is ideal for drawing out a game though
[5:16:06] Kalvixish: he just needs to wave clear every lane so they can't push
[5:16:11] sunflower204: your team will probably just run them over if the game gets late enough
[5:16:17] TheKushMinister: but he doesnt know that, hes too busy calling neeko trash LUL
[5:16:49] WantedOne: irelia in on it now LOL
[5:17:30] BaosilisK: its just bickering ijpLAUGH
[5:17:31] Kalvixish: annoyingly you need this Vel to actually clear waves to draw it out
[5:17:36] Kalvixish: but he seems to be 1 of the worst here
[5:18:22] Kalvixish: Urgot, what are you doing
[5:18:29] Lodba: go nash when urgot dos that
[5:18:32] TheKushMinister: crabgot things
[5:18:35] thrillhouse451: I think JP should go pro. Start making some money on the circuit
[5:18:35] Lodba: there is 4 bot
[5:18:36] shemg: yea not a great play by him
[5:18:38] AsocialSociologist: hey, itmeJP and chat cohhDap
[5:18:50] Kalvixish: he's getting the occasional tower, but he dies for every tower he gets
[5:18:50] thrillhouse451: @eladrine ijpBOOP
[5:19:33] TheKushMinister: its hilarious seeing neeko having to use ult for an execute instead of using it to 100-0 someone
[5:19:43] AsocialSociologist: @thrillhouse451 cohhBoop
[5:19:48] Lodba: your e giws vision no ?
[5:19:52] Kalvixish: I mean do these people realise that flaming neeko isn't going to make her play better
[5:19:53] Genostar0: Baron will be the nail in the coffin
[5:20:02] Askann: it's funny to see silver rank players fight for no reason at all

[5:31:56] Tiamattinen: Trundle is one of my favorite champs, love seeing him get play
[5:32:15] ghostsofcarcosa: @AinzN ijpLOVE appreciate it very much
[5:32:19] Kalvixish: I mean theres trundles in challenger so clearly hes not that weak
[5:32:36] AinzN: ijpEZ Clap
[5:32:44] WantedOne: lol no assist to mid :p
[5:33:33] Kalvixish: weirdly done thing at least in higher elo on trundle seems to be ignore tiamat and go right into sunderer
[5:33:50] Tiamattinen: Trundle's kit is also pretty much unchanged since his creation and he has no super fancy mobility tricks
[5:33:55] Kalvixish: not sure if thats because they go for gank heavy strat or just ignore some camps
[5:34:01] Tiamattinen: just good and solid bruiser gameplay
[5:34:53] Derdrom_TJM: JP why the W max?  Isn't Q better for damage?
[5:35:17] itmeBOT:  We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info:  https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[5:35:36] sunflower204: I've seen people go E max too
[5:35:47] Derdrom_TJM: Ah I see.  I usually put 2 points in it early but max Q.  lower CD and more damage for Q spam is so good
[5:36:27] Kalvixish: grandmaster trundle does W first, then Q, E last
[5:36:42] Kalvixish: W gives you not only damage but better closing speed is probalby reason
[5:36:57] Derdrom_TJM: @Kalvixish I haven't seen that build before.  I haven't played JNG in forever
[5:37:28] Lodba: that flash from adc
[5:39:13] Kalvixish: free herald
[5:40:06] Aviutershi: the freest of haralds
[5:40:52] Kalvixish: probably would have been better using the herald mid
[5:40:58] Kalvixish: could have got another 2-3 plates of gold
[5:41:45] Kalvixish: lol she miss-flashed
[5:41:47] Buttzyy: KEKW
[5:41:56] WantedOne: failed flash, oof
[5:41:58] zymioi: ijpCHEER

[5:42:42] Kalvixish: Nah you have Akali
[5:42:48] Kalvixish: and Tryns is split pushing well
[5:43:05] Kalvixish: at least Ashe accepts she is doing badly so isn't tilting yet
[5:43:51] Kalvixish: yethis is a win
[5:44:13] 14neo: nice plays though ijpH
[5:44:18] Nurama: Greedy and your team, backed you up. soooo it works
[5:44:18] Fynagle: I've seen a lot of Ashe in the past couple of weeks. What happened in the pros that caused this?
[5:44:30] BaosilisK: its good if not punished ijpHAHA
[5:45:42] Kalvixish: help Tryn with pushing top
[5:46:40] Kalvixish: I'd put it mid to open that up
[5:47:23] Kalvixish: the triple charge
[5:47:41] Kalvixish: I mean ye that worked VERY Well though
[5:47:59] Kalvixish: 3k gold
[5:48:00] cleansock42: have you never seen the Shelly Dance?
[5:48:46] BaosilisK: holy shh ijpLAUGH
[5:48:47] Pingues: well ashe not joining

[5:51:37] Kalvixish: sunderer deaths dance definitely the combo
[5:51:45] RumoSenpai: Clap
[5:51:52] Kalvixish: 14!!
[5:51:58] Reijm11: wow
[5:52:01] BaosilisK: it went up ! ijpPOGGERS

[5:52:13] Kalvixish: it's great being jungle
[5:52:13] AinzN: Got an extra 1 LP for not dying! NODDERS
[5:52:14] Nurama: 7/11 :O you made snacks of them
[5:52:32] Kalvixish: nobody respects junglers :(
[5:52:41] RumoSenpai: FeelsRainMan
[5:52:43] hanguntv: @itmeJP stand straight
[5:52:44] jeffhunter12: 1 win would do it
[5:52:47] Darkaros: COPIUM FFXIV 6.1 soon
[5:52:56] BaosilisK: COPIUM
[5:52:56] Achubra: at this rate you might even get to skip silver 2 and go right into 1
[5:53:02] NightFaeFox: COPIUM
[5:53:31] BaosilisK: that gamer posture all day NODDERS
[5:53:45] DoctorJohn: ive been working hard to try and improve my posture
[5:53:51] DoctorJohn: try and improve my neck and back pain lol
[5:53:59] Khuja__: we need a good catch phrase fro Trundle. I miss "I'm the god dammed river king" being shouted :)
[5:54:06] DoctorJohn: a lumbar pillow?
[5:54:14] DoctorJohn: ive gone through a lot of them, havent found one yet that works well for me
[5:54:19] DoctorJohn: my problem is im both
[5:54:21] DoctorJohn: i move in my sleep
[5:54:28] ceilss: Kaisa mid - that's a dodge
[5:54:31] Achubra: thats a gross team
[5:54:34] AJAnimosity: @itmeJP In an earlier game, you walled off someone and slaughtered them and I said to myself "Trundle is such a fucking troll" :|
[5:54:35] The_Faceless_Void: Stomach sleepers unite KEKW
[5:54:40] DoctorJohn: and i snore on my back much to my wife's consternation
[5:54:42] ceilss: absolutely useless champ mid
[5:54:43] The_Faceless_Void: Stomach sleeping is superior
[5:54:44] Kalvixish: I need to invest some money in lumbar stuff, like a nice lumbar supporting char.
[5:54:44] inuakurei: I switch, depending on my mood
[5:54:47] Kalvixish: But those thigs are like 1.5k
[5:55:03] DoctorJohn: i gotta get a chair like sam's, i sat in one that my friend owns and it was the most comfortable thing
[5:55:20] Reijm11: I want a pillow with active cooling, like a heat blanket but reverse
[5:55:22] Kalvixish: Nautilus, oh yeI forgot he exists
[5:55:30] jeffhunter12: man that is a craaazy team
[5:55:38] zombo_com: justy play sion hullbreaker top and go 0/18 and still win cause its the meta
[5:55:56] BaosilisK: @Reijm11 a cold blanket HahaSweat
[5:56:04] zombo_com: doesnt really accent anything
[5:56:08] Kalvixish: You can if you are going to split push as it'd be past the laning phase you'd want it
[5:56:21] Kalvixish: and as trundle can split push you could as like a 4th item
[5:56:27] zombo_com: as its for lane minions and towers, if you're splitting solot as JG Possibly?
[5:56:50] ceilss: Told ya - Kaisa mid is 100% dodge
[5:57:00] Gorriliaz: Yeah, 3 hypercarries, not one of them can get fed or its over ^^'
[5:57:03] zombo_com: im hating this Kaisa Mid meta, mine always feed
[5:57:22] Kalvixish: 1 thing I would recommend, get a QSS after your sunderer, it'll help you deal with Mord
[5:57:30] Kalvixish: though he might not ult you as you can ult him right back
[5:57:30] spacemarine55: how do you quikc check on your teamates real fast ?
[5:57:37] spacemarine55: jsut type in every name or is there an addon ?
[5:57:40] jeffhunter12: ijp7
[5:57:50] ceilss: @zombo_com its Korean meta... But the truth is - even in korea it doesn't work LUL
[5:57:55] cuttlefishsquid: mid AP kaisa ? ugh either go big or flop
[5:58:07] zombo_com: i use blitz.gg
[5:58:17] Gorriliaz: Mord shouldn't really want to ult trundle tho. Usually, whoever ults the other first in morde/trundle matchup loses
[5:58:20] zombo_com: i think porofessor is decent as well?
[5:58:23] spacemarine55: oh wow first tiem seeing your setup thats crazy cool
[5:58:25] Achubra: 7 monitors is weird, round it up to 10
[5:58:27] crawds: you have a good AC for the summer?
[5:58:32] Kalvixish: I use professor poro, gives you stats of em when it loads in, and stats for you in-game
[5:58:37] Kalvixish: which is handy to see where you are struggling
[5:58:37] CastIronJake: @itmeJP That TV/Monitor always gives me a chuckle whens its with all of the others
[5:59:25] cleansock42: can I have your room?
