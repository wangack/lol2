[0:34:41] OGBlaze_Official: @altizar Doubt it would achieve anything, not a standard reportable offense cuz he is still playing
[0:34:46] DoctorJohn: this kind of childish shit was why I gave up competitive overwatch. So many people who think they are a professional godsend held back by the other people on their team every single game

[0:35:50] SgtStruthers: @SgtStruthers True also the game was built to incite rage like this
