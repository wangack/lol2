[0:54:42] SuperHaxx: i think the big bad can be Chthon
[0:54:47] OriginalName2: @gooseboy429 I think citorak or however it's spelled.
[0:55:08] ReginaldXIV: Petah Pahka
[0:55:09] Reckless_Rob: Yeah but you didnt see the other guys

[0:55:37] Memitim: I want chimkin
[0:55:45] Drakoni23: They originally wanted the NWH trailer to look like a "Civil War" between Strange and Spidey
[0:55:46] OmarKhaledBadr: It would be wild if it was Chthon
[0:55:47] TheAetherParadox: I mean... thanos looked BAD before his CG was done and Marvel got flamed for it
[0:55:51] Zrmi: @raptorscream It's the same as the comic where its a god
[0:55:52] FataltheBaptist: she hulk got pushed right?
[0:55:52] raptorscream: but everyone knows Goblin's laugh
[0:55:53] MythGameStream: @itmeJP You think Beta Ray Bill will make a cameo?
[0:55:54] spideycsa: Dr. Strange is the MCU's new tony stark. Maybe they are working towards a midnight sun type of epic movie
[0:55:59] ThemDemo: For normies this trailer makes Zeus seem like the villain kinda
[0:56:05] Ravnim: anyone else get futurama deth by snu snu vibe from the the giant skeleton LUL

[0:59:02] Omid18: mild take: worst episode thus far
[0:59:04] PlayWithMonsters: geez, guess i check the yt for that one
[0:59:07] Spartan_Bobo: Did yall see where Moon knight is apparently a limited series
[0:59:15] spideycsa: this episode was the lore dump
[0:59:27] BlueSapphyre: limited series makes the 6 episodes make sense.
[0:59:27] Ravnim: oscar isaac is the goat actor
[0:59:30] 0GHammer: the council of gods was so stupid omg
[0:59:33] ruiyolas: it was a crazy episode 󠀀 󠀀
[0:59:34] guvkon: Episode 3 was pretty bad
[0:59:38] skythe00: the avatar meeting was a little hokey lol
[0:59:42] spideycsa: notice in the background the moon was 1/2 full as well
[0:59:53] SilverNiKr: they did the man in the ocean!

[1:00:06] PlayWithMonsters: ijpS
[1:00:08] MikeTsa7: dumbest pantheon  󠀀
[1:00:09] TheAetherParadox: THERE IS A MAN... IN THE OCEAN
[1:00:10] RandomTangant: My favourite part was "Our case against Harrow for the Gods must be airtight" and then their plan turned out to be "You gotta believe me bro!"
[1:00:12] frozen_eggo: veiO stars  󠀀
[1:00:16] Malitor: Konshu's "Presence" during the god meeting was stupid
[1:00:19] guvkon: I was checking time left in the middle of the episode
[1:00:21] GregoryGlen: ijpKEK
[1:00:27] Siggenlh: someone is fucking with the sky again.
[1:00:30] yrvengalied: they were from Cairo yes
[1:00:33] Bob__Z: Not again…
[1:00:36] Laidjon: It made the gods angry
[1:00:41] Devlind: This might all be in Marc's head still
[1:00:53] Ravnim: could just used a $3 starmap app instead of manipulating the skies LUL
[1:00:54] Siggenlh: wierd it was only 1 crowdshot.
[1:00:54] Ceaseless_: i assume just the stars. he said he remembers every night so just a projection of that night type thing
[1:00:55] svensonidis: LUL
[1:01:00] VyRe40: A therapist, or a cult leader.
[1:01:00] Darkaros: COPIUM
[1:01:01] ワフルデラ: dude, the therapists need therapists
[1:01:01] ItsNoxid: ijpKEK
[1:01:01] Drakoni23: To me it looked like a "projection" of how the stars looked like
[1:01:05] BlueSapphyre: post snap, stars moving is normal.
[1:01:07] guvkon: But the beginning and the very end were pretty cool
[1:01:09] TheAetherParadox: Also... those stars are systems with people in them... did captain marvel get flung like 8 billion lightyears
[1:01:39] raptorscream: Mark to Stephen was so great
[1:01:41] spideycsa: 3rd persona likes to stab things too
[1:01:47] BroqRox: ijpNODDERS  󠀀 󠀀
[1:01:47] Siggenlh: dont we know what the sky looked like 2000 years ago IRL?
[1:01:49] 0GHammer: JAKE
[1:01:54] bakavic: who is the 3rd persona?
[1:02:04] BaosilisK: well the spell itself made like lines in the sky that was just the moon going around really fast so it wasn't just a projection thing
[1:02:05] KatjeMauw: Siggenlh sorta
[1:02:05] Tyronin: o loved it
[1:02:07] Drakoni23: Oh yeah. Turns out good acting is the best special effect
[1:02:10] CptArimus: the acting was great in that scene, but it was terribly written. "No U are bad"
[1:02:11] ilsombrero: he soundes like Broken Matt Hardy
[1:02:12] spideycsa: jake should be the 3rd one
[1:02:14] Sathias: @Siggenlh The stars move so it would be different 2k years ago
[1:02:14] vashaun: i thought that was odd. i dont understand why he was yelling. felt out of place
[1:02:15] blissfuldan: The council portion was so bad
[1:02:17] SeekoBlastar: "Our case need to be perfect" Proceeds to present no evidence
[1:02:26] Siggenlh: the council of the gods didnt give a shit either way it seems.
[1:02:30] Norrak1: I thought it was that Marc/Steven wasnt letting him fully have control?
[1:02:30] Zaelsus: his eyes during the screaming were great, showing the confusion if having a god speak through you
[1:02:42] Ravnim: PauseChamp
[1:02:42] KatjeMauw: Siggenlh between ancient notes and simulations we kinda can, its not 100% sure, but as close as possible
[1:02:47] GrannySith: sure we can :)
[1:02:48] Tyronin: i think he lost his cool quickly. He seems more emotional then the other gods
[1:02:50] Bitghost_: I dont understand how the gods can't "see" what Harrow is doing
[1:02:52] Tyronin: I agree with Bronze here
[1:02:57] ChosenDark1: couldn't have been like check his wrist he's got a tattoo for ammit on it
[1:02:59] ReginaldXIV: lol

[1:03:18] esi_vee: LUL
[1:03:19] DagooX: greyC
[1:03:25] skythe00: its true, the other Gods chilled out and just kind of live as avatars, Khonshu still wants to be a God
[1:03:32] Spools_: when you aren't listening take LUL
[1:03:36] BroqRox: LUL
[1:03:37] chon_chon: Destiny?
[1:03:37] Siggenlh: how persuasive you are.
[1:03:42] Docgalaad: the chewbacca manouever
[1:03:46] SuperHaxx: ben shabibo as i call him
[1:03:46] Tyronin: Yeah Khonshu seems unhinged comapred to the other gods, and Harrow knew that and was fucking with him
[1:03:52] buckfugler: shabibo
[1:04:03] JusticetoAll: that scene was dumb haha aren't they gods? can't they just read his mind or something?
[1:04:08] Lutcha81: if you can't win with arguments, try volume - from calvin and hobbes
[1:04:24] Tyronin: @JusticetoAll no their not gods, they are gods like thor is
[1:04:32] Tyronin: just an alien race
[1:04:42] ThemDemo: Yeah Harrow says in ep 2 that Khonshu is prone to childish outbursts
[1:04:48] Tyronin: ^
[1:04:51] RandomTangant: The problem I had was, it wasn't like they actually HAD any evidence tho
[1:05:06] FaceMcShooty: it kinda sucks that konshu can rewind the stars like a few thousand years but nobody can sense where harrow is coming from
[1:05:17] ItsNoxid: when he mention how he remembers every night, when i started liking Konchu
[1:05:19] Xanctius: But its gods yeah
[1:05:26] Grond_: so is thor
[1:05:33] Tyronin: there not gods tho. They are pretending to be. Like Thor
[1:05:34] FataltheBaptist: gods are lazy
[1:05:35] stresstest: Gods acting as Scared kids
[1:05:36] GrannySith: they're already kinda tired of his antics as well
[1:05:39] Sir_Nerdly: But why don’t they know
[1:05:40] afreak10: Gods that really don't want to intervene  󠀀 󠀀
[1:05:42] Estwilde: Thor is too, and he's not 'above' anything like a deity
[1:05:43] spideycsa: most gods are winey little bitches since they have so much power
[1:05:55] Tyronin: They don't seem to have Omnipotence
[1:06:17] bitspirit3: so is this moonknight shit any good? I 've been considering watching it
[1:06:18] Siggenlh: the gods are like centrist they want the status quo. dont rattle the order of things
[1:06:25] Ricstitch: the other gods already hated Konshu and needed very little to choose Harrow's side?
[1:06:32] TweektheProphet: The point of MCU gods is they don't care about anything except themsleves
[1:06:34] ilsombrero: american politics in a nutshell
[1:06:37] NinjaXI: I also dont think the screaming was entirely intentional, it feels more like marc was resisting
[1:06:42] Tyronin: @tano_cosplay 100% this

[1:07:07] m3rcer: i mean
[1:07:10] Deadpixzl: truth
[1:07:11] Sir_Myrmidon: incoming 'Gorr was Right' mugs

[1:07:17] LeelandGrant: Thors mum seems pretty ok
[1:07:18] LuckyNumber: No Gods Madge
[1:07:19] Docgalaad: dont forget the best one, loki
[1:07:33] Needleinahaystack: yeah but he has a literal staf and a tatoo with the image of the evil godess, don't the "gods" see that????
[1:07:56] 0GHammer: @Needleinahaystack RIGHT???
[1:07:58] spideycsa: Maybe Konshu did it on purpose to lit another  fire under Marc
[1:07:59] Ravnim: konshu's got a bird brain sooo
[1:08:14] BlueSapphyre: i have a feeling that the gods want to free ammit also.
[1:08:22] OvaryPunch123: Did the scene with Harrow and one of the gods talking after khonsu's imprisonment shown they were in on it with Harrow? A part of me felt that way.
[1:08:26] yrvengalied: this is Jesse right now in my head https://c.tenor.com/JmH3vcFBiGcAAAAC/cutebiker-gravityfalls.gif LUL
[1:08:27] braljoh: Gorr, he a'ight, maybe think about workshopping the whole "God Butcher" name a bit, maybe. cohhHmm
[1:08:36] Siggenlh: debates are never about finding the truth.
[1:08:39] frozen_eggo: but that reveals the location 󠀀 󠀀
[1:08:41] RandomTangant: If their argument got derailed in the meeting that would have been fine, but it was more they just didn't even have an effective argument in the first place
[1:08:44] spideycsa: not all 9 gods were at the meeting thing too
[1:08:51] ChosenDark1: @Needleinahaystack tbf he didnt bring the staff and seems to have hidden his arms behind his back. however marc still should have brought it up
[1:08:52] Xanctius: But Jesse...that would ruin the show...
[1:08:52] ItsNoxid: The gods turned so many other gods into stone, they kinda sussy
[1:08:54] Sir_Myrmidon: they don't know where the prison is iirc
[1:09:05] yrvengalied: LUL
[1:09:08] Siggenlh: there were a lot of stonestatues.
[1:09:10] ThemDemo: It's also that the gods dont want to be involved with earth at all, like they are avoiding earth at all costs it seems like
[1:09:23] the_ch0: KEKLEO
[1:09:24] BlueSapphyre: @spideycsa 2 were missing. like Steven said in episode 1.
[1:09:27] Osskssa: that was Marks first time doing it
[1:09:32] m3rcer: ijpKEK

[1:09:59] JosieSprings: LUL
[1:10:04] DobbsjustDobbs: That was great!
[1:10:07] riot_vision710: HEY I AM TALKN LIKE DIS
[1:10:14] Legionnare92: when we gonna talk about the potential 3rd violent persona cuz there are moments Steven thinks its marc but Marc blacks out
[1:10:17] FaceMcShooty: he has the tattoo on his arm xD
[1:10:17] frozen_eggo: he WAS an avatar  󠀀 󠀀
[1:10:20] Tyronin: maybe he has his own access
[1:10:21] Siggenlh: sam raimi dutch angles came out
[1:10:24] riot_vision710: heeyigh
[1:10:27] Treatmentjoe: I think he is Anubis
[1:10:28] DobbsjustDobbs: He was an avatar
[1:10:31] ThemDemo: They have sympathy for him because of Khonshu
[1:10:31] 23Thijs: maybe he's buddy buddy with the judges
[1:10:31] EvilBuho: That felt super stupid
[1:10:32] Siggenlh: Hathor is sus
[1:10:38] Norrak1: I bet he has a deal with the bald dude avatar?
[1:10:40] Tpocket: they rtreated him like poor abused former avatar
[1:10:43] Spools_: "we're just gonna leave you here" ..
[1:10:46] TheTychusReaper: Maybe it's cause he's been accused?
[1:10:53] Ceriwyn: former avatar perk?
[1:11:10] Zandivya: I think it's because they're rushing the story to get it done in three episodes
[1:11:10] Siggenlh: he was the accused. so he showed
[1:11:16] frozen_eggo: I think it was more to just plead his case
[1:11:22] normalnaut: Maybe they're suggesting the council has been rigged
[1:11:35] riot_vision710: And where is Rah through this ?
[1:11:44] Tyronin: We thats Moon Knight. All through the comics we are taught how much the gods suck. Even Khonshu is an asshole
[1:12:00] skythe00: also I wonder if the Egyptian Gods are also aliens like the rest or are they actually native to Earth?
[1:12:12] Xanctius: only 3 episodes left, going to be some very busy episodes
[1:12:13] spideycsa: A lot of between the panels type thing in this series
[1:12:15] ItsNoxid: yep
[1:12:30] Zrmi: I think it's the actor guy, we saw a cameraman in frame too
[1:12:30] m3rcer: im fine with it
[1:12:32] ChosenDark1: i thought the cut was showing resistance in giving over control
[1:12:39] ilsombrero: yeah it seems that they always do it when a person takes over that Steven does not know of
[1:12:47] Drakoni23: To me the "annoying cut" means "forceful takeover"
[1:12:47] synthetik666: 6 episodes or what not seems like such a big mistake. should be a minimum of 10 in my opinion
[1:12:49] JBfromAccounting: @itmejp  did you see the theory about the guy who cut his own scarf had a possible Kang pharaoh headdress on his jacket?
[1:12:53] 23Thijs: the jarring cut is because he's not in control of the transition, when he deliberatly gave control there was no cut
[1:13:01] Lutcha81: i like that cut, shows how he looses consciousness
[1:13:04] SabertoothEwok: Marc not knowing about third personality is weird, their constitency of how much Marc knows about DID is bad
[1:13:05] guvkon: I love the cut
[1:13:13] Memitim: is this moon knight stuff?
[1:13:38] Zrmi: I think it's Jake the actor
[1:13:41] VyRe40: They have the 2 reflections in the museum scene in the first ep too.
[1:13:47] ilsombrero: @itmeJP shouldn´t you put the spoiler tag on the screen?
[1:13:50] VyRe40: Steven, then 2 reflections behind him.
[1:13:53] Ravnim: they could have changed jake like how they changed steven
[1:14:03] Drakoni23: Also the moon in the credits keeps getting fuller. We are at half moon now and will probably end on full moon in the last episode credits
[1:14:04] ThemDemo: Steven in the comics isnt what he is in this either tho, I think the 3rd will be named Jake but will have different traits from the comics
[1:14:06] spideycsa: might be Jake becuase of the driving part in the first episode
[1:14:08] Tpocket: yeah third personality seems the unrepentant killer that was "needed" given mark can't commit
[1:14:08] itmeJP: ilsombrero should be doing a lot of things, staying awake is the primary concern atm though!
[1:14:13] Norrak1: Isn't "moon knight" an actual personality in the comics?
[1:14:17] Siggenlh: we dont think its KOnshu himself taking over?
[1:14:25] itmeBOT:  We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info:  https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[1:14:29] ilsombrero: sorry, my bad
[1:14:29] riot_vision710: Yeah but where are we going with this story ITS ONLY 6 episodes
[1:14:45] ChosenDark1: i thought it was konshu controlling his body physically
[1:14:45] OmarKhaledBadr: That kid was a pretty well known Egyptian actor btw
[1:14:53] Barrh: steven also istna rich man
[1:14:56] Siggenlh: i dont think they gnna do flashbacks. since the havent done any already
[1:14:58] 23Thijs: Steven and Jake were massively changed for the show i think
[1:15:03] spideycsa: Midnight might show back up as well
[1:15:03] BroqRox: lol 󠀀 󠀀
[1:15:06] Ravnim: @Norrak1 seem they are using the moon knight as different costumes for each personality
[1:15:13] skythe00: what if Marc is actually Jake? and the Third is real Marc? zekeTHINK
[1:15:13] Quemi_Totl: Saw someone speculate that the 3rd personality might be a mcu rewrite and perhaps being the bushmaster of the mcu version
[1:15:40] itmeJP: Quemi_Totl oh I like that
[1:15:46] Lutcha81: @skythe00 Marc did seem rather Psycho when kicking the glass in episode 2
[1:15:52] Tyronin: I think the 3rd personaily is going to be all the bad in Marc, like how Steven is all the good in him
[1:15:53] frozen_eggo: Frenchie? 󠀀 󠀀
[1:15:58] Quemi_Totl: since harrow seems really sure that steve/marc/whoever did kill laylas father
[1:16:09] CorporalPibb: stripHmm
[1:16:11] SabertoothEwok: But Steven is also not what comic Steven is either
[1:16:13] Imbadyoureworse: dang what did i miss 󠀀
[1:16:18] spideycsa: I also like that you hear glass when Ethan Hawking walks around still
[1:16:49] NixonNarwhal: Mark protecting Layla from the third personality by using steven
[1:16:52] Zrmi: I don't think they were really murders but his personality being an actor playing in a movie 'killing' bad guys
[1:17:03] Nicius: the moon has 4 main phases... maybe there will 4 personalities or maybe there is 3 and konshu...
[1:17:31] Tyronin: yeah
[1:17:32] Imbadyoureworse: so we think jake is the psycho?
[1:17:55] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:17:58] Tyronin: Jake is pretty ruthless, he murders people all the time in cold blood
[1:18:00] aerhelios: i disliked that part too
[1:18:08] BroqRox: that part was weird
[1:18:10] ItsNoxid: he was suppose to be a bigger deal before the actor died
[1:18:12] Barrh: he is supposed to be midnight man or something
[1:18:13] Norrak1: Doesn't that actor end up being an important character?
[1:18:13] spideycsa: they guy the visited was Midnight also from the comics
[1:18:17] ChosenDark1: 3rd personality is the "random bullshit go" and "dracula you big nerd" type of psycho?
[1:18:18] LessSanity: @Imbadyoureworse yes, jake is THE ruthless psycho personality
[1:18:18] The_Shift_Key: I think that's just how rich people be
[1:18:18] Bitghost_: yeah that was so weird
[1:18:19] BroqRox: and harrow popping up out of nowhere 󠀀 󠀀
[1:18:19] Laidjon: Anton looks like buff crendor to me
[1:18:20] Norrak1: Ya he is Midnight
[1:18:24] Malitor: Unfortunately, he died
[1:18:25] Imbadyoureworse: the actor who played anton died so idk if that had anything to do with it. like it was edited wierd and was meant to be more @itmeJP  󠀀
[1:18:26] OmarKhaledBadr: The acting was very disconcerting agreed

[1:18:31] Sophiaan31: YEah too bad he died
[1:18:33] Bitghost_: and he got real murdery REAL quick
[1:18:35] Osskssa: RIP that guy in red the actor passed
[1:18:35] VyRe40: FYI, the spear guy collector, Anton, is a character from the comics. He's Midnight Man. @itmeJP The actor passed away though in a skiiing accident.
[1:18:39] Spools_: he was like classic 80s TV show villain
[1:18:40] spideycsa: Unfortunately that is teh actor that died as well
[1:18:41] SabertoothEwok: That actor also passed away
[1:18:42] DobbsjustDobbs: I mean, he dies IRL
[1:18:42] SuperHaxx: Anton was suppouse to have a bigger role but he died so they had to cut out alot sadly
[1:18:48] Greywind424: the actor died irl
[1:18:50] GrannySith: he just felt like a throwaway character to me

[1:19:24] Norrak1: There was a In Memory of at the end
[1:19:28] BlueSapphyre: that death on a horse looked like a reshoot.
[1:19:35] OmarKhaledBadr: He was a setup, that's really sad
[1:19:37] spideycsa: you hear teh clocks chiming midnight as he rides away
[1:19:40] RandomTangant: Nah he got got by Moon KNight
[1:19:41] Osskssa: in the credits the English bodyguard that Layla knew was credited as Bushman
[1:19:43] riot_vision710: that guy wasn't more than 34
[1:19:46] Siggenlh: wasnt that character a reocuring guy in the comics.
[1:19:52] Imbadyoureworse: yea its sad actually 󠀀 󠀀
[1:19:54] Greywind424: he got a moon weapon in the back of the head
[1:19:55] BroqRox: like the edition was weird 󠀀 󠀀
[1:19:57] Zrmi: Ah he was in a fatal skiing accident
[1:19:58] riot_vision710: damn prime of his life
[1:20:15] spideycsa: in the comics Midnights son is becomes a "robin" like character to moonknight
[1:20:25] riot_vision710: imagine getting the part in Marvel show
[1:20:41] BaosilisK: ijpSAD
[1:20:56] Imbadyoureworse: harrow right?
[1:21:02] Imbadyoureworse: yea lol 󠀀 󠀀
[1:21:08] DobbsjustDobbs: Harrow's men
[1:21:14] BroqRox: they left something behind the port, but never picked up back
[1:21:26] Reijm11: There was also a weird mastubatory joke when steven/marc was alone with the sarcafacous
[1:21:35] spideycsa: I bet they editied a lot of stuff out from that scene
[1:21:44] BlackholeYeti: what even was in that bag?
[1:21:56] doriyahfromdowntown: Gasper Ulliel collided with a skier at a resort, resulting in a fatal brain injury. R.I.P.
[1:21:57] BroqRox: what was in the bag?! 󠀀 󠀀
[1:22:18] LFC_Letters: all of this stuff was probably cut because he passed... there was probably alot of setup of his character
[1:22:31] DobbsjustDobbs: Yeah I bet that entire scene was rearranged
[1:22:47] riot_vision710: Alright I'm taking another dab to help straighten out these inconsistencies  nikaPop nikaDaze nikaJuice

[1:24:51] GhostEyedDog: seqInsane PianoTime
[1:24:58] Tyronin: the show is very fast paced i agree
[1:25:06] Docgalaad: i think the exact opposite, i'm waiting for this show to have action eventually
[1:25:33] Drakoni23: Khonshu literally sais "Tick, Tock"
[1:25:37] Dratheaon: everytime an  episode ends, i feel like, its over already? I want more!!!
[1:25:48] itmeJP: Dratheaon same!
[1:26:07] s10thking: it was torn into pieces though
[1:26:15] FrozanFlames: Harrow I think didn't find ammit so he needed them to get it and find those coordinates is how I read it.
[1:26:50] ThePointGaming: i thought Moon Knight peaced him out?
[1:26:53] Tyronin: im loving it as much as Loki
[1:27:01] Magna2xlc: This show needs 13 episodes like Legion to marinade in the psychosis.
[1:27:06] Darkaros: D:
[1:27:09] ReginaldXIV: monkaSHAKE
[1:27:26] riot_vision710: Episode 1 was great
[1:27:33] ThemDemo: It's dark just not graphic, which I think is good
[1:27:39] Tyronin: ^
[1:27:50] Tyronin: It's a great way to handle dark for Disney
[1:27:51] allAshees: it's so jarring that there is no blood
[1:28:03] Dunkhart: @ThemDemo preach ijpH
[1:28:16] riot_vision710: Is the show right now great? no, but it is fun
[1:28:29] mexican_computer: I learned it from you dad
[1:28:31] Tyronin: I'm wondering if this is how Blade is going to be. A lot of dark topic's and situations, without it being graphic
[1:29:09] Zrmi: That kid had a Rama Tut logo easter egg on back of his jacket
[1:29:21] ThemDemo: @Tyronin I think this is a good starting point, I imagine blade will really push up to the line
[1:29:25] Osskssa: iys not his cult tho...
[1:29:27] riot_vision710: if they don't make Blade rated R they'll have fucked up royally
[1:29:49] 0GHammer: he couldve been snapped
[1:29:50] Tyronin: @riot_vision710 Disney is never going to make a rated R movie lol
[1:29:52] Siggenlh: maybe thats just the quality you need to be a good avatar
[1:30:21] AdonaiEIohim: experts that know nothing
[1:30:22] hkharp: Nah, I think he just enjoys the pain.
[1:30:27] BlueSapphyre: @riot_vision710 deadpool 3 has been confirmed to be R. no?
[1:30:32] MythGameStream: What if the pain keeps Conchu from taking him over again?
[1:30:38] riot_vision710: @tyronin I think they may yet learn have to learn how
[1:30:45] Osskssa: @Tyronin Deadpool will be r rated already said so
[1:30:49] nicklepolaroid: You could hear the glass in his shoes in this last episode
[1:31:00] Bitghost_: Harrow prob got addicted to the power/pain and uses the glass as a way to remind him of it
[1:31:05] Tyronin: I still don't know if Deadpool will be, i can see Disney pulling it back
[1:31:05] Reijm11: We also don't know who might have been the original person before Knoshu as far as i know
[1:31:13] Souzo_: oh that's an interesting take
[1:31:19] riot_vision710: @bluesapphyre that's what I've been hearing
[1:31:25] Siggenlh: we dont know if the other avatars sees their gods. that might be what happens if you keep seeing them.
[1:31:28] ThemDemo: I think the glass in his shoes is pennance for his sins as Khonshu's avatar
[1:31:31] 0GHammer: thats prominent in many scenes LUL
[1:31:42] frozen_eggo: he has the tattoo move when judging ppl  󠀀 󠀀
[1:31:46] Treatmentjoe: Doesn't the tattoo move every time he judges people??
[1:31:47] Protonerd: Yeah it's not exactly hidden LUL
[1:31:50] RandomTangant: It's the judging tattoo
[1:31:53] Tyronin: oooo
[1:31:56] SilverNiKr: @Treatmentjoe yes
[1:32:00] nicklepolaroid: Anubis was a stone, wasn't he?
[1:32:03] Magna2xlc: you see the scales move when he judges souls
[1:32:03] SilverNiKr: the tattoo shows the judging
[1:32:04] nicklepolaroid: I saw a meme about it
[1:32:04] riot_vision710: It makes sense... they slid the Netflix rated R series over to D+
[1:32:14] Tyronin: @nicklepolaroid oh really?
[1:32:26] Drakoni23: Maybe he blipped so the other Avatars are still ok with him being around
[1:32:29] vashaun: how did she miss the scale? they focued on it a few times
[1:32:29] riot_vision710: and they see the analytics
[1:32:49] frozen_eggo: maybe crocodiles are just a shitty summon  󠀀 󠀀
[1:32:49] Darkaros: stripYum vore
[1:32:58] Siggenlh: disney might split up the marvels shows into difrent age-groups but have guest roles from other series.
[1:33:03] Kreunt: didn't sg-1 already kill anubis
[1:33:09] nicklepolaroid: @Tyronin I saw a picture of it in a Moon Knight group in Facebook, but I didn't catch it for myself and haven't seen the episode again to make sure. So take it with a grain of salt
[1:33:11] TweektheProphet: amit eats those who are judge unwothy from anubus
[1:33:12] 14neo: a bit late, but welcome Sequisha raiders! ijpH
[1:33:12] riot_vision710: so if people are watching
[1:33:16] TheArgentGod: @Kreunt ha!
[1:33:20] Heisuisui: @Kreunt KEKW
[1:33:27] spideycsa: Wonder if bast will show up in the black panther stuffs
[1:33:28] Tyronin: @nicklepolaroid it's a good thing to look into when i rewatch it
[1:33:30] Hyper_Remy: @Kreunt LUL SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:33:34] Osskssa: and sg1 killed hathor too
[1:33:52] Tyronin: there is crocdile head demons like the jackels i think
[1:33:55] nicklepolaroid: @Tyronin Yeah!
[1:33:59] kennethmcmillan: BUT. Loki was a gator
[1:34:01] Dratheaon: Maybe hes trying to harness multiple gods?
[1:34:02] 23Thijs: imagine a croc waddling after steven up the stairs, very threatening
[1:34:07] spideycsa: what is crocadile loki shows up in the tomb?
[1:34:08] Tpocket: easier recognition yeah, yer probably right
[1:34:08] Siggenlh: we should fight the crocodille with an alligator
[1:34:09] heronlord: ammit was part crocodile part hippo and part lion
[1:34:11] Magna2xlc: they already had the assets from mummy movies
[1:34:14] VyRe40: They might have a crocodile miniboss later in the series, who knows.
[1:34:18] OmarKhaledBadr: egyptian crocodile symbology can be pretty terrifying though tbf
[1:34:20] Imbadyoureworse: might isis shell help you in a crisis
[1:34:26] s10thking: he is claiming it to be judgment but its not, as long as harrow uses "judgement" to consume people he can use the powers to summon creatures and what not even with the god being sealed
[1:34:28] SlipCrit: ijpD
[1:34:31] BroqRox: isnt that why the avatar invited harrow to see the statue
[1:34:36] frozen_eggo: the kid is Kang POGGIES  󠀀 󠀀
[1:34:40] the_ch0: D:
[1:34:43] spideycsa: aman-ra
[1:34:45] BlueSapphyre: rama tut.
[1:34:50] keathleyy: It's been confirmed by the creators.
[1:34:55] ThemDemo: New Rockstars contacted the producers and they confirmed it
[1:34:55] VyRe40: Rama Tut IIRC.
[1:34:57] TheArgentGod: that's just the hat of the combined dynasties...
[1:34:57] Imbadyoureworse: looks like a baby bottle top 󠀀 󠀀
[1:34:57] ItsNoxid: its been confirmed it
[1:34:59] Osskssa: looks like a bottle
[1:34:59] EvilBuho: it has been confirmed by the creator
[1:35:00] spideycsa: yar rama tut
[1:35:03] Zrmi: it's his head
[1:35:03] WDForty: they have contacts with prop ppl and it is
[1:35:12] Reckless_Rob: Thats definitely a thing
[1:35:15] JumpTroopC5: Confirmed with who?
[1:35:17] SlipCrit: ijpHMM ijpHMM ijpHMM
[1:35:22] oaktree3: prob just cameo XD
[1:35:23] riot_vision710: they can pad the Blade film with a separate studio

[1:35:27] spideycsa: the shows creator
[1:35:30] da_printer00: @itmeJP Do you think Arthur Harrow will become the Shadow Knight?
[1:35:30] Sir_Myrmidon: 'It was Kang all along' montage at the end? (Sorry was rewatching wandavision)
[1:35:35] VyRe40: I think the jacket could just be a throwaway easter egg that's not meant to mean anything.
[1:35:39] Malanor85: its all part of Kang's Plan
[1:35:39] frozen_eggo: idk doesn't Kang just like Egyptian style stuff? cause Kang is from the future vineConfuse
[1:35:40] Siggenlh: it just gonna be an esteregg but in 3 movies they gonna horseshoe in a direct link LUL
[1:35:41] ritchie313: could of been kang at one point
[1:35:41] SuperHaxx: @JumpTroopC5 they say the know prop people at the show and asked them and they confirmed
[1:35:41] VyRe40: They just put the design in there for kicks.
[1:35:41] TweektheProphet: Kang hate the gods and he is the reason they left the Marvel Universe
[1:35:43] BlueSapphyre: kang wants to free ammit?
[1:35:46] DannPunk: Obviously it's Mephisto LUL
[1:35:50] OmarKhaledBadr: I would love it if the actress did mocap for a crocodile woman LUL
[1:35:51] Magna2xlc: what about Apocalypse?
[1:35:57] Zrmi: Rama Tut pulling the strings.. he was the one who betrayed the other Egypt gods

[1:39:57] Quemi_Totl: @spideycsa apparently marvel has listed moonknight as alimited series to the emmys so not likely
[1:40:01] Osskssa: @Altair900 its a one off series

[1:55:49] JumpTroopC5: I think it is Gozer the Gozerian
[1:56:06] Tpocket: I think the current thought is: Ennead just means 9, so MCU remixed who is "in" the 9, so they're trying to figure out who are the 9?
[1:56:09] ChosenDark1: so the last one is Kek clearly
[1:56:09] Zrmi: They are all banished gods?
[1:56:13] Magna2xlc: Ennead consists of nine gods: Atum, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys are the gods of Heliopolis.
[1:56:16] HawkeyeP1erce: I think Bast and Anubis are the ones missing? Because the Bast one would be Black Panther or Wakanda adjacent. Might be excluded for that reason
[1:56:21] DJSpinladan: where is slifer the sky dragon

[1:59:58] gorlork: ijpSUS
[1:59:59] s10thking: well wouldnt that also follow along with the multiverse, considering venom had no clue who thanos or the avengers were, and isnt moonknight confirmed part of the same universe as venom?

[2:03:28] Quemi_Totl: like in RL mythology loki is the father of hela, not her step-brother
[2:03:29] WDForty: he calls it a piece of Ammet's power
[2:03:30] kennethmcmillan: he said it was a part of her power
[2:03:32] Zrmi: Rama Tut once made an Anubis android LUL
[2:03:35] FrozanFlames: I mean it has crocs as the handle

[2:03:47] zestyzanzil: ^
[2:03:49] JessieVanitas: the cane is the Amit's gift to her first avatar and contains a sliver of her power
[2:03:55] Magna2xlc: The cane is to gator heads back to back
[2:03:59] ChosenDark1: doesnt the cane have gators on it?

[2:04:09] Treatmentjoe: Horus and Osiris were the last 2 Jesse
[2:04:12] zestyzanzil: He says the cane is “a fraction of her power.”
[2:04:26] JumpTroopC5: King-To-Pawn 2 Tut
[2:04:34] Malitor: Jackals are generally used as generic minions by media as Anubis is one of the more popular gods.

[2:05:57] BaosilisK: imagine if you see wanda also in the mental ward Kappa
[2:06:02] SlipCrit: ijpCHEER

[2:06:16] SpaceDive: or morbius PogChamp
[2:06:18] s10thking: i think the reason he tells steven to tell marc to go get him is because the other personality can take over marc but cant take over steven

[2:54:16] DrewGamer: at first I thought JP was exagerating a bit (mostly just been listening)...but damn that team DO be rotating hella quick for Silver players.
[2:54:16] Lunar688: That brand has ulted minions 2 times now hah
[2:54:17] issalga: which one of them is pinging non stop? I hate him
[2:54:19] Percussion1: brand refuses to leave mid, lets vex roam all over, clearly jungles fault
[2:54:34] Mondo_Gibbs: Brand is so outdated in mid it makes little sense to play him there... There are so many other mage champs that is better him for it fx Vex or Xerath
[2:55:05] Chopstix2005: wait is brand running barrier?????
[2:55:27] woofser: This looks like a fun match Crungo
[2:55:29] Mondo_Gibbs: @Chopstix2005 Kinda need to it in mid vs a Vex she can gap close so quick
[2:55:33] DrewGamer: to be fair, it's Silver so people could probably get away with just about any champ. But they have to actually know what's going on in the game KEKW
[2:55:41] AinzN: Get this Brand out of here!
[2:55:48] RallyBannerLive: honestly having team chat off is the only way to play
[2:56:02] yrvengalied: Hmm JP you might need to rest the throat
[2:56:08] Lunar688: I do
[2:56:11] AinzN: RallyBannerLive he used to allmute but playing Jungle you need a bit of team communication
[2:56:12] Birgerz: @MondoGibbs eh comfort has value, not like its valid here but for some people like me have thousands of hours in one champion, like me with singed. He might be shit but at least I know all his interactions inside and out
[2:56:22] Birgerz: you can turn you chat of as jungle
[2:56:32] Birgerz: just go in to it as a solo race
[2:56:36] Birgerz: when everyone else is
[2:56:43] DrewGamer: I try to give people the benefit of the doubt when the game starts, but I won't hesistate to mute mid-game if a particular person is being annoying @RallyBannerLive
[2:57:17] svensonidis: is it like this in higher leagues too? like, blame throwing, BM, etc.
[2:57:41] mayosilog: This always happens on holidays
[2:57:41] izzyiv: time for a bramble vest
[2:57:51] BroqRox: fro content he said lol
[2:57:59] Rdei: Goof luck on your games JP
[2:58:00] DD_The_Shmey: @Helphen666 did you say my name?
[2:58:09] DD_The_Shmey: What's up?
[2:58:15] ritchie313: wow xin definetly went carry build
[2:58:19] AinzN: DD_The_Shmey I think DD is an item in game
[2:58:25] DrewGamer: @Helphen666 add on the Steelcaps and its an especially rough time :(
[2:58:41] DD_The_Shmey: oh, @AinzN you mean he wasnt calling me an immortal?
[2:58:51] DD_The_Shmey: ah ok ok <3
[2:58:53] AinzN: DD_The_Shmey clearly! NODDERS
[2:59:04] DD_The_Shmey: Keepo
[2:59:09] woofser: Just tank it 4Head
