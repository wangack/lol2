[0:35:57] itmeBOT: Hey @roboticbiotic777, to time someone out please send a message @ing who you want to time out, for example "I would like to timeout @Dave thanks" or simply just "@Dave". Just a FYI: I am unable to timeout JP, Mods or VIPs.
[0:35:57] ElSpartin: and singlepalyer
[0:35:57] DyingEros: @Siggenlh Not minor but major. I still get what you are saying though.
[0:36:04] Gingla: Is this game going to be 60?
[0:36:04] cyberronic: well, Im an idiot now
[0:36:04] griff_ow: there is an ENITRE PVE part of the game they haven't even showed yet
[0:36:06] Systemic66: it still is something other games don't charge for
[0:36:07] Turbologic: Minor patch NODDERS
[0:36:08] Norrak1: Only 5 years
[0:36:12] gedeff: i am NOT an idiot. I am VERY smart AND clever
[0:36:13] Sluggs_: you can still play overwatch 1 and get all these changes
[0:36:14] Dumt: Isn't it also an engine update?
[0:36:14] NinjaPandaEU: New engine, new heroes (more are coming before release), new game mode, new maps, and the update is free.
[0:36:17] Systemic66: they just do it incrementally
[0:36:19] ReginaldXIV: Normal Doomfist flies into a group of 6 with a Mercy pockets, kills everyone and flies away
[0:36:22] Archangel3003: Tell me you haven't followed OW2 develpoment without.... you know the rest KEKW
[0:36:30] Systemic66: which is a fair model
[0:36:31] Reckless_Rob: Oh really?
[0:36:31] DobbsjustDobbs: Still didn’t need to be new gamenpurchase
[0:36:40] kuronomiya: feels like 2016 watching some overwatch again
[0:36:44] Norrak1: Which we know next to nothing about unless I missed videos?
[0:36:47] DobbsjustDobbs: That’s fine
[0:36:52] itmeBOT: @siggenlh, @roboticbiotic777 has requested you be timed out, But I'll give you 30 seconds to say your last words (for 10 mins).
[0:36:56] ReginaldXIV: All of the CC is relegated to tanks and healers now which is nice
[0:36:59] BakaOniiChan_: oh all the changes apply to O 1 ? i didnt know that
[0:37:00] Systemic66: do we know how much they charge fro the pve
[0:37:04] BakaOniiChan_: OW 1*
[0:37:05] estebanstrangiato: have they shown any PvE stuff
[0:37:06] Gingla: So I  dont get it, i can play overwatch 1 againts a person that has overwatch 2? @itmeJP . Im confused
[0:37:07] JonnyFiveO: I really think they should have marketted it as an expansion rather than a sequal. A lot less confusion that way.
[0:37:10] Reckless_Rob: Thats pretty high
[0:37:11] DyingEros: Lets be honest. I doubt the PvE is going to be that huge. Between what they have done in the past and talked about doing in the future I don't think PvE is going to be it. Plus the player retention will almost exclusively be PvP.
[0:37:16] Archangel3003: @Siggenlh Are you doubling down? LUL
[0:37:19] KelticNight: haven't played OW in like 5 years? feels like forever ago
[0:37:21] Reckless_Rob: Oh yeah almost
[0:37:22] itmeBOT: Hey @siggenlh, This timeout is sponsered by RAID SHADOW... I mean @roboticbiotic777, See you in 10 mins.
[0:37:34] AinzN: Siggenlh ijp7
[0:37:46] griff_ow: @DyingEros you're out of your mind if don't think Blizz devs can make a fantastic PVE game out of OW
[0:37:50] Dieelon: holy shit

[0:38:04] DyingEros: @griff_ow Can and Will are two entirely different things
[0:38:16] Dieelon: FUN DETECTED
[0:38:17] an_kush: is this not just overwatch 1? and they gonna charge 60 quid for it?
[0:38:26] itmeBOT: Hey @kelticnight, to time someone out please send a message @ing who you want to time out, for example "I would like to timeout @Dave thanks" or simply just "@Dave". Just a FYI: I am unable to timeout JP, Mods or VIPs.
[0:38:31] Rawrsong: I wanna see him punch a Mercy or Pharra out of the air
[0:38:34] Dellago: You never know, they still havent removed Mercy's super jump
[0:38:34] HeroHarmony: off topic: will we be watching Homeworld 3 in an hour? :D
[0:38:39] JeedanJune: PvE takes too much effort, so just stick with PvP at this point tbh @griff_ow got no trust left in Blizz, but maybe they pull a miracle lol
[0:38:42] KelticNight: @RoboticBiotic777 pride comes before a fall NODDERS
[0:38:42] itmeBOT: @roboticbiotic777, @kelticnight has requested you be timed out, But I'll give you 30 seconds to say your last words (for 10 mins).

[0:39:05] Gingla: Chat somebody help me , if I have overwatch 1 and I dont care about PVE, do I have to buy Overwatch 2? I dont get it @itmeJP
[0:39:07] MrGein_182: he was too hard to play for me :( im bad

[0:39:19] JonnyFiveO: Doomfist was good if it wasn't me playing him.
[0:39:19] ReginaldXIV: They're probably removing Cassidy's flashbang tbh
[0:39:25] an_kush: @NinjaPandaEU is that the ps5 base price for games?
[0:39:29] Archangel3003: I could never master how to play Doomfist tidy and just left people who could play him do their thing
[0:39:29] Mrshilka: @HeroHarmony spillt he beans!

[0:39:31] Dellago: "Overwatch 2" is just the PVE content. All the changes they're making to PVP are applied to the base game
[0:39:33] HeroHarmony: @Mrshilka It will be from gearbox
[0:39:33] Reckless_Rob: Inf ammo
[0:39:39] NinjaPandaEU: @Gingla The PvP update is announced as free.
[0:39:40] Mrshilka: ooo gearbox coool
[0:39:43] Dumt: @gingla No. Overwatch 2 PvP will be free. The Overwatch 2 PvE is going to cost.

[0:40:21] BigWaldo7713: essentially this is overwatch 1.5
[0:40:21] Dieelon: ehhh i prefer old orisa
[0:40:26] Reckless_Rob: @KelticNight LUL
[0:40:27] NinjaPandaEU: @an_kush Ah okay. I play PC. OW1 is $40 on PC, so not full price. I'd be surprised if OW will cost more.
[0:40:27] as_ter_blast_er: Rip my main
[0:40:28] griff_ow: that is actually a pretty sick sound effect tho
[0:40:34] Turbologic: Thank god no more Orisa shields NODDERS

[0:42:49] 1killersquirrel: Your brother is doing Overwatch 2 content? Kappa
[0:42:53] Archangel3003: That doing a big chuck of damage is ok since it's a skill shot you have to aim. So a reward for landing it
[0:43:02] griff_ow: and its gonna be really fun to watch in the hands of pro's
[0:43:16] HadieHim: blizzard realized that all the shields they added killed their game
[0:43:17] BigWaldo7713: prety much
[0:43:19] Supwizy: He said the S word monkaSHAKE
[0:43:20] Mrshilka: @1killersquirrel look how witty this poerson is
[0:43:30] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[0:43:37] NinjaPandaEU: I guess it also functions differently. Shields and health actually took different damage from different weapons/sources.
[0:43:43] Stormmaggeddon: Revolutionary Kappa
[0:43:48] KelticNight: @RoboticBiotic777 "jokes on you, I'm at work and have a meeting to go to. nice try, nerd. ijpSMUG haha no hate, tho." pls stop NODDERS

[0:45:44] Supwizy: SIGMA BALLS
[0:45:45] hillowa: also pvp will be 5v5
[0:45:46] Reckless_Rob: Oh thought that was Zenyatta LUL

[0:52:46] 1manpizza: is the sound some placebo stuff?
[0:52:48] Bhu1234: @gytax_ the 'Gold' is a type of special Weapon Overskin that's available for all heroes. Unlocking Golden weapons takes grind and winning a lot, so it's more like a show-off thing.

[1:10:26] cyclonicrift: Is overwatch 2 just one big update rather than an actual second game @itmejp ?
[1:10:26] Tiny_Muffin: why play OW when you can play TF2 for free :)
[1:10:33] Frostwol: is he just showing UI and visuals?
[1:10:34] Siggenlh: what timeframe is that poll for? this year? or at all?

[1:11:22] Bhu1234: She was the most broken character, they were completely out of touch of how powerful she'd be when they released her
[1:11:22] IronFistOfChina: yeah, but it was also the fact you could run more than 2 tanks

[1:23:35] ranin: i think it's the correct way of doing things, like in csgo you can win a round 1v4 or even 5
[1:23:42] BigWaldo7713: LOL

[1:24:06] Mrshilka: The year Misses and I left the USA eldest step daugther signed herself up for a credit card and insta 20k depbt NODDERS
[1:24:06] middleagedavid: Dem Bennyfits tho
[1:24:07] xLichdenheim: That card won't give you more mana in league though Kappa
[1:24:08] Siggenlh: JP soon certified "adult gamer". he gonang et his card in the mail first.
[1:24:36] AinzN: Mrshilka so you sold the kid to pay for that debt?
[1:24:43] Siggenlh: does the whales get a platinum gamer card? asking for a friend
[1:24:48] ag_blues: Who is this McCree
[1:24:55] WDForty: i do hate stuns so much
[1:25:01] WDForty: stun locks were so BS
[1:25:01] Mrshilka: @AinzN nah its her debt stupid child she is still paying it off 5 years later lol
[1:25:07] yrvengalied: ijpKEK
[1:25:14] AinzN: Mrshilka ouch! ijpONO
[1:25:15] ChiZWorkshop: I feel like this will change as people get used to the maps and new gameplay mechanics
[1:25:17] Gynocopter: they fly now CrungoSpin
[1:25:24] ChiZWorkshop: OW played like this on launch too originally
[1:25:25] KAWS__: does this have a br
[1:25:26] Jukettaja: Where's Pharah?
[1:25:30] Mrshilka: no br
[1:25:40] hillowa: yes ow has replays
[1:25:54] AnorienNightwish: OW1 has replays already, has had for a while now
[1:25:55] hollysephiroth: ewwwwwwww
[1:26:02] ranin: oh no they have gone the lol way?
[1:26:16] Reckless_Rob: Ana is sick
[1:26:18] hollysephiroth: so homogenization , thats always end up fun
[1:26:33] ChiZWorkshop: FFXIV is also doing this
[1:26:39] Siggenlh: who need class restriction is a classbased game.
[1:26:41] WDForty: DVa eating an ult was so statisfying
[1:26:49] k0jak: these people are too good at this game
[1:26:50] Liminaly: so OW looses it's identity of all characters not being generic ?
[1:26:52] ranin: i mean if you can't balance then you have to make everyone similar
[1:26:53] Mrshilka: Nerf this NODDERS
[1:26:55] KAWS__: no br means it will do as well as halo infinite
[1:27:12] Mrshilka: halo is not a hero shooter
[1:27:16] m3rcer: i guess it means the game becomes easier to pickup
[1:27:17] Mrshilka: this is a hero shooter
[1:27:24] Mrshilka: they are nothing alike
[1:27:25] STNbond: ????
[1:27:27] Dieelon: this guy just says shit and hopes for the best
[1:27:29] IronFistOfChina: This guy is awful
[1:27:31] BuggleStrus: weird take...
[1:27:33] the043: did he play a fighting game before?
[1:27:37] BigWaldo7713: yes
[1:27:37] Darkaros: 🙃 I think I dislike the last two content creators
[1:27:37] ElSpartin: true
[1:27:38] 1manpizza: NODDERS
[1:27:43] salvagedrifter: I need him to finish the fighting game thought
[1:27:44] Mrshilka: yep owl
[1:27:46] SergeitZ: YUP
[1:27:46] Dieelon: true tho
[1:27:49] Reckless_Rob: For me it was being dependant on your whole team all the time
[1:27:50] GrateWhiteDope: They forced it too hard
[1:27:51] ArthurNudge: is owl still a thing?
[1:27:52] ValcoNick: why?
[1:27:54] Cronopolis: Yup
[1:27:54] BigWaldo7713: they got rid of fun for COMPETITIVE
[1:27:55] Majaboo: did he just say something then completely contradict what he just said in the same sentence with the whole tank thing?
[1:27:56] Siggenlh: the thing that "killed" battlefield. removing more of the uniqeuness between classes. where every lineup is the same and everyone can a bit of everything.
[1:27:56] k0jak: yep ArthurNudge
[1:28:00] ranin: forcing a game into esports i never good
[1:28:01] l1ttlelechuga: i felt like nothing new was ever added
[1:28:02] huemaahn: true they stopped trying to make the game fun
[1:28:02] ArthurNudge: orly... wow
[1:28:03] Sonatta: yeap
[1:28:18] relyks88: yep happened to me with apex too, everyone becomes a sweat
[1:28:21] xyzlime: @itmeJP can u explain y? just want to know
[1:28:23] k0jak: i mean OWL was real fun, and the city tie-in made it a lot easier to "attatch" to a team
[1:28:32] IronFistOfChina: Can we watch the video but mute it
[1:28:36] Siggenlh: i dont like that the monkee got a long range gun now. it kinda defeats his unique purpose.
[1:28:39] k0jak: but everyone in ranked just forced OWL comps even if it was bronze
[1:28:39] ValcoNick: owl had nothing to do with their shitty balance philosophy where they try to balance for all skill levels instead of just balance around high level play
[1:28:40] ElSpartin: no I wouldn't conclude that form this gameplay
[1:28:43] SaraScorpion: never cared about OWL :)
[1:28:50] GrateWhiteDope: lol
[1:28:50] VoltecZero: Doomfist is a tank now?
[1:28:55] Lan_d0t: Yeah he's a tank now
[1:28:58] KAWS__: @Mrshilka that was not my point
[1:29:05] tecwa: i dont know, everything he hypes up sound liek a super turn off :(
[1:29:11] Schmubbs: It feels like this guy is shouting at me
[1:29:11] Reckless_Rob: Thank you
[1:29:14] Dieelon: doomfists a tank?! interesting
[1:29:18] ReginaldXIV: Have they added a scoreboard?
[1:29:18] ranin: i feel like everyone deals less dmg now, has it become a sponge shooter?
[1:29:20] Siggenlh: be a tank but play like the DPS. a dps with extra HP
[1:29:29] Rhikaroo: man i dont like this guy
[1:29:29] Rawrsong: Adult Gamer
[1:29:32] STNbond: holy shit 6 years....
[1:29:32] m3rcer: was it tho
[1:29:35] ChiZWorkshop: It sounds like this is more a case of people just not being used  to the changes yet than actual gameplay changes for the meta
[1:29:35] SgtStruthers: So its just becoming a even worse TF2 KEKLEO
[1:29:35] tkordeliski: Winston got a railgun to replace the tesla cannon?
[1:29:37] TamboTv: is this guy serious ?
[1:29:38] Rhikaroo: but i guess i am just not an adult gamer
[1:29:39] BigWaldo7713: it was more fun
[1:29:44] cyclonicrift: I’m sorry 6 years?
[1:29:46] windgod2000: I remember the launch marathon JP did
[1:29:53] KAWS__: stuns were there since day 1
[1:30:06] m3rcer: did this guy not play at launch?
[1:30:07] gorlork: 6 years monkaW
[1:30:09] middleagedavid: Yeah, shit I watched that
[1:30:11] Sidewinder3121: simpler times
[1:30:11] Darkaros: QC remembers the launch stream NODDERS
[1:30:13] StupendousHam: danOld so long ago
[1:30:16] grimeylive: i was extremely drunk on launch night. don't remember much
[1:30:17] cyclonicrift: I feel so old
[1:30:23] Reijm11: I was there pretty sure
[1:30:24] Mrshilka: I still have OW CE
[1:30:24] k0jak: yeah i feel like generally in games if you make stuns you have to center the balance around the stuns or it becomes unfun
[1:30:24] Rhikaroo: i think there was a lot of fun stream content during the early beta
[1:30:25] BlueSapphyre: inflation.
[1:30:27] Reckless_Rob: I mean, wont there still be OP team comps?
[1:30:27] Sidewinder3121: or should I say simpless times
[1:30:27] STNbond: Double mcree when you could melt a tank with 1 fan the hammer
[1:30:29] BigWaldo7713: i put many hours into day 1 overwatch LUL
[1:30:34] KAWS__: !followage
[1:30:34] itmeBOT: We don't track followage. If you're on browser, you can click your own username to see how long you've been following the channel though!

[1:30:46] Jukettaja: Can you still lane swap?
[1:30:46] Catelfy92: onlywatch
[1:30:48] NinjaPandaEU: I remember watching the beta tournaments in late 2015 iirc. Or early 2016. Beta tournaments were so fun.
[1:30:53] cooliokj77: 24 hour giveaway i remember that
[1:30:53] Jukettaja: Character swap even
[1:30:55] Siggenlh: i play it intermittenly every few months and honestly cant tell whats changed
[1:30:57] 1manpizza: people switching heroes will surely happen Kappa
[1:31:01] Puretaz: you did a good rotation of characters when you did it though
[1:31:03] BigWaldo7713: i remember the video by Totalbiscuit that got me hooked int othe game before release
[1:31:18] Mrshilka: TB Pepehands
[1:31:23] Mrshilka: PepeHands
[1:31:28] KAWS__: that was fun to watch
[1:31:28] EvilBuho: it was great to see that
[1:31:32] ElSpartin: 100%
[1:31:33] EvilBuho: Oh for sure
[1:31:36] NinjaPandaEU: Oh there will be.

[1:31:42] Xibate: these changes sound alot like they are made to make overwatch league look better
[1:31:43] eniGzor: easily
[1:31:44] Rhikaroo: USA vs Spain 2
[1:31:48] Reckless_Rob: I mean I dont mind a little League now and then. Watching it
[1:31:49] TamboTv: drama sells on twitch
[1:31:58] xarantur: Yeah they're gpnna ruin OW2 before it can get going ruuKek
[1:32:23] BigWaldo7713: i just hope they dont focus competitive play and add some casual fun too
[1:32:34] 1manpizza: bastion moves PepeHands
[1:32:42] jeffrey_characterwheaties: how can they call this "2"? lmaoooooo
[1:32:45] Dieelon: looks too little
[1:32:47] ElSpartin: drive by minigun
[1:32:48] Reckless_Rob: Yeah they look big LUL
[1:32:53] mephium: there's so close together
[1:32:59] ArthurNudge: 'not final visuals'?
[1:32:59] m3rcer: i think its the grey background and not being spread out
[1:33:01] WDForty: they took away everyone's stats, you only see your own stats now
[1:33:02] Kurooben: valorant POG KEKW
[1:33:04] Klont: Less detail vs OW1
[1:33:09] Reckless_Rob: Wait, the tank has a minigun now?
[1:33:09] Reijm11: I kind of like it, looks clean
[1:33:09] salvagedrifter: wow, jp with 22,370 peak overwatch viewers
[1:33:11] mephium: they're
[1:33:18] Klont: same with the ult meter, more detail in the current game
[1:33:23] Liminaly: @ArthurNudge because it's Alpha?
[1:33:26] Darkaros: ????
[1:33:26] Rhikaroo: ???
[1:33:28] 1manpizza: rpg? OMEGALUL
[1:33:30] BigWaldo7713: thats what makes it call of duty@!
[1:33:31] mephium: huh
[1:33:32] Siggenlh: what
[1:33:32] ranin: ???? :D
[1:33:32] m3rcer: rpg KEKW
[1:33:33] woofser: WTFF what
[1:33:34] Gynocopter: ???
[1:33:39] BigWaldo7713: theres no emphasis on teamwork anymore
[1:33:45] GrateWhiteDope: wot
[1:33:47] Kyshakk: He's talking about GOATS
[1:33:47] Schmubbs: I'm not sure this guy ever played OW1
[1:33:48] the043: this guy with his analogies
[1:33:52] ArthurNudge: Liminaly because it says on screen. dunno if that aspect will get changed, just offering a pov
[1:33:56] Siggenlh: a weak hero? sounds like a balance issue.
[1:33:59] Darkaros: I think this guy isn't actually an adult game Hmm
[1:34:02] Systemic66: seems very optimistic
[1:34:08] GrateWhiteDope: so its like call of duty
[1:34:12] raivo9n: will the discontinue OW1 ? @itmeJP
[1:34:12] Dieelon: that guy actually makes a great point, the most frustrating thing in the world in OW is having to match a dps character to deal with certain threats like Pharah/Mercy combo
[1:34:15] Siggenlh: no team in teamsshooter.
[1:34:17] the043: @Schmubbs I'm not sure he even played anything before LOL
[1:34:20] BigWaldo7713: so call of duty where every man for themselves
[1:34:23] Reckless_Rob: Wont there still be very good team comps
[1:34:30] IronFistOfChina: His analysis is OV1 = Bad and OV2 = Good
[1:34:31] xhaven: I dont like it
[1:34:34] BarryCarlyon: The greater good
[1:34:42] xhaven: I prefer OW 1's style
[1:34:45] the043: first the fighting game comparison and now the RPG... like what?
[1:34:51] Sidewinder3121: yea I'm a jucnkrat main how could you tell BBoomer
[1:34:56] Liminaly: the video guy is viewing this through band new games goggles, give it a month and there'll be a meta again
[1:35:01] itmeBOT:  We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info:  https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[1:35:07] ranin: next the civ comparison
[1:35:09] IronFistOfChina: Idk I don't actually think it was that 1 dimensional
[1:35:09] The_Faceless_Void: Ehh idk if this game will hit the mark
[1:35:09] Stormmaggeddon: Meta isn’t as important
[1:35:14] middleagedavid: Suprise Mechanics???
[1:35:19] Rhikaroo: its not aim chat its accurasy
[1:35:21] Hyluhnduh: what about symmetra?

[1:35:24] Reckless_Rob: This actually looks kinda fun NotLikeThis
[1:35:25] mephium: who is mcree
[1:35:26] Siggenlh: i honestly wished they removed some of the heroes and give alt weapon or skill instead. there is simoply too many i i rarely see a third of them in a gamenight.
[1:35:27] Dumt: Best Pokèmon is Blissey. All hail her Special Defence.
[1:35:28] StupendousHam: gordita
[1:35:28] Dieelon: who the fuck is mcree?
[1:35:29] BigWaldo7713: def an adult gamer
[1:35:29] Lan_d0t: Bruh gee TUH
[1:35:29] Schmubbs: @Schmubbs "This game is just like Monkey Island....now hear me out, after hearing about our sponsor, this random mlm debit card"
[1:35:33] mephium: I only know cassidy
[1:35:33] Reckless_Rob: McCassidy

[1:36:26] Jukettaja: Can't fault you for that
[1:36:28] IronFistOfChina: too many syllables
[1:36:30] Jukettaja: No one can remember Cassidy
[1:36:34] AinzN: Reckless_Rob ijpSAD
[1:36:37] Misanthrope89: is this ow2 gameplay? looks the same as ow1 KEKW
[1:36:46] BigWaldo7713: its ow1.5
[1:36:53] Reckless_Rob: @AinzN yeah they want less stuns i guess. But good damage as Mei is nice too
[1:37:01] BigWaldo7713: its just a large free expansion for pvp and pve is paid for
[1:37:03] tkordeliski: Every competitive game has a meta, just to new to define it
[1:37:04] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW
[1:37:06] SgtStruthers: There are some
[1:37:09] HadieHim: there are diablo skins ya
[1:37:09] LunarBound: Halloween skin

[1:37:11] Yeagher: halloween skins i think
[1:37:11] BigWaldo7713: probably
[1:37:11] NinjaPandaEU: They had some of them yeah.
[1:37:11] Rhikaroo: well it seems nice
[1:37:14] LunarBound: Gargoyle
[1:37:14] IceReaper898: Yeah that's in the game already
[1:37:14] Reckless_Rob: That is a horn
[1:37:18] IronFistOfChina: Halloween Winston Skin]
[1:37:18] AltraWolf: Halloween
[1:37:24] Sidewinder3121: they're honry

[1:37:36] The_Faceless_Void: what
[1:37:38] LunarBound: There are diablo and Warcraft and starcraft skins though

[1:37:45] AinzN: I think there were some Diablo skins in the game as I remember a Barb Zarya
[1:37:54] Dieelon: i agree, ow2 actually sounds awesome after this video
[1:37:59] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP idk about the no tank peeling tho that seems bad on paper
[1:38:00] Reckless_Rob: So Sombra silence is 1 sec?
[1:38:06] SgtStruthers: Left trigger holders OMEGALUL

[1:38:12] Reckless_Rob: Yaaaay, Ana :D
[1:38:13] zenoots: I'm just happy it won't be a solved game now
[1:38:20] MrGein_182: can you link that video JP ?
[1:38:26] Reckless_Rob: @AinzN Undisputed
[1:38:27] itmeJP: https://youtu.be/4HSvgiKidyo
[1:38:29] Siggenlh: guess im skipping this then.
[1:38:30] MrGein_182: thanks !
[1:38:33] ranin: i have to admit that in ow1 it was pretty frustrating to play if your dps didnt shoot shields at all
[1:38:39] tkordeliski: this guy honestly doesn't sound like he played that much high overwatch
[1:38:51] Whiskeydog23: launch day?
[1:38:51] Oinned: is the video showing ow1 while explaining ow2?
[1:38:52] SgtStruthers: I wish we could pick and level skills like in hots. Have a little choice in hero build
[1:38:54] Dieelon: this seems much more friendly towards solo players
[1:38:55] IronFistOfChina: Baptiste, Mercy comps sound great
[1:39:07] Incredible_Sausage: Pepega
[1:39:09] konvay: of course :/
[1:39:27] IronFistOfChina: idk if Zen will or ana will be viable
[1:39:49] 1manpizza: Wonder if OW2 will get the more casual players back, seems like a lot of these changes might make it harder for them Hmm
[1:39:49] Tartaroc: i dont care what is working for the pros
[1:39:55] WDForty: it's always so fun playing support and getting sniped first cause no one will cover you ijpSUFFER
[1:39:57] AinzN: As long as I can still one shot headshot Tracer with Mei's ice spike I'll be happy!
[1:40:00] BigWaldo7713: i was always the tank :(
[1:40:01] Reckless_Rob: Urchins? DansGame
[1:40:03] Hemry64_: nobody likes playing tank in OW
[1:40:12] BigWaldo7713: i love tank but you get shit on so much
[1:40:12] Reckless_Rob: I liked Winston
[1:40:19] IronFistOfChina: i loved off tank
[1:40:21] The_Faceless_Void: Ah yes blizzard still catering to the pro's and 1%ers in their games. Nothing chanes
[1:40:22] StupendousHam: of course
[1:40:22] Reckless_Rob: @BigWaldo7713 Yeah LUL
[1:40:24] Whiskeydog23: i will still only main Junk Rat
[1:40:27] IronFistOfChina: main tank was bedge
[1:40:47] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP the more he says stuff about the pros the less I care. No one cares about the pros
[1:41:02] Liminaly: ouch
[1:41:03] AnorienNightwish: ijpKEK
[1:41:04] Reckless_Rob: Accurate

[1:41:09] Whiskeydog23: nice
[1:41:14] wookie_hairy: Haven't played OW in years, think I might give 2 a go
[1:41:17] KDRushby: self awareness is a good trait
[1:41:18] Rhikaroo: i think there is still going to be a pain point though? everything he is saying is there is more focus on fighting but its still an objective focused game?
[1:41:18] BigWaldo7713: wow
[1:41:32] Dieelon: lmao
[1:41:32] BigWaldo7713: LUL

[1:41:46] Sonatta: opt in for Dragonflight beta.... what ever happened to being able to just opt into all beta on battle net
[1:41:47] bulletsponge55: Admitting it is the first step you know lol
[1:41:47] zenoots: blizzard becoming self-aware
[1:41:47] middleagedavid: ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS
[1:41:52] The_Faceless_Void: @Rhikaroo yeah this guy has show more going for elmis than he has defending a point
[1:41:56] tkordeliski: supports already got farmed in ow1 if there wasn't strong team play
[1:42:20] ElSpartin: draft is the death fo this game, again
[1:42:21] SgtStruthers: Draft with 10 heroes KEKW
[1:42:26] Dieelon: theres not enough characters for draft lol
[1:42:28] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW draft mode with who?
[1:42:29] mephium: didn't they have that weekly hero ban stuff or something
[1:42:31] Siggenlh: role overlap gonna mean even more fo the character wont gonna appear in a match since everyone can do everything. even if they do it a bit worse.
[1:42:33] IronFistOfChina: I think the first 2 meta's  are going to either be full damage comps, but i think shield comps will still be the meta eventually
[1:42:34] Reckless_Rob: Oh yeah..the wall
[1:42:36] SgtStruthers: There is not a big enough roster for draft
[1:42:39] Joebeezer: let me ban genji every game and I'm in
[1:42:40] LunarBound: That's the opposite of the game though, which is switch to adapt to your enemy
[1:42:42] Joebeezer: Keepo
[1:42:49] mephium: yeah like will they ban 2 characters?
[1:42:55] VincentRSu: something like Raibow six maybe 1tank 1 healer ban
[1:43:01] JumpTroopC5: Oh you are isuq…I was trying to figure out who that was on my friends list. I did dailies with you in BfA on my shaman. @itmejp
[1:43:02] The_Faceless_Void: ????
[1:43:08] mephium: and will they have to be polled by your team?
[1:43:09] Siggenlh: there is already way too many characters i see so few of them
[1:43:20] Reckless_Rob: So is it more casual friendly? But were not sure about high level
[1:43:35] The_Faceless_Void: So whats the point of drat que if not to counterpick or make it so only 1 champ works against a comp
[1:43:36] Liminaly: are these design principles he keeps quoting directly from the devs?
[1:43:39] The_Faceless_Void: I find that hard to believe
[1:43:44] ArthurNudge: can you no longer switch heroes mid-round?
[1:43:46] m3rcer: i tot one of the biggest draws of the game was you can swap midmatch if within ur role after role locks became a thing
[1:43:46] KDRushby: do you think he has a script or just wings it?
[1:43:58] Reckless_Rob: This is a very long monologue
[1:44:01] ElSpartin: Yes but also no
[1:44:01] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:44:01] tkordeliski: He says there won't be any meta then says that there will be an ultra stale meta of s-tier heros
[1:44:02] zenoots: he's contradicted himself a ton in this video. lol
[1:44:02] IronFistOfChina: Don't trust anything this guys says
[1:44:02] 1manpizza: @Reckless_Rob think it depends what the playstyle for casual players is. Someone who just healed before, might not be very viable with 5 player teams
[1:44:13] Reckless_Rob: Yeah..
[1:44:13] ElSpartin: He's bad at explaining himself and beign concicse
[1:44:15] The_Faceless_Void: UH solider isnt female?
[1:44:15] HadieHim: theres always going to be a tierlist, a meta
[1:44:16] The_Faceless_Void: what
[1:44:22] VincentRSu: gotta fill 10 minutes for adds
[1:44:23] yrvengalied: OW2 seems to have been designed for esports in mind
[1:44:26] mephium: sojourn faceless
[1:44:28] Siggenlh: didnt he say that he think having a meta is good? aka a stale game.
[1:44:29] tkordeliski: people complained so much about widow wtf
[1:44:29] Rhikaroo: no when you have to click heads people just call aimbot
[1:44:29] xhaven: yea this guy really represents the 1% of players that care only about top ranked play
[1:44:30] mephium: no soldier
[1:44:30] STNbond: ok but what about the most important part of overwatch...the skins
[1:44:33] 1manpizza: His comparisons are some stretches
[1:44:34] mephium: not*
[1:44:36] Tezius: This feels like theyre stuck between a competitive esports design and a "have fun smashing your action figured together" design
[1:44:37] Incredible_Sausage: he's double-speaking
[1:44:38] Reckless_Rob: Bolth
[1:45:00] KAWS__: is this gameplay from OW2?
[1:45:02] SgtStruthers: Sounds like the lead dev is a algorithm
[1:45:05] the043: this video should have ended 10 minutes ago at least
[1:45:05] Dieelon: actually true
[1:45:07] Siggenlh: esports > fun for casuals.
[1:45:11] Joebeezer: drop esports design and we all win
[1:45:17] m3rcer: same shit with heroes of the storm
[1:45:24] Joebeezer: there's a reason why overwatch peaked pre overwatch league
[1:45:25] Siggenlh: esports for esports sake. not for the players.
[1:45:29] xhaven: I think the focus on the esports killed OW1 many players just enjoyed playing
[1:45:34] The_Faceless_Void: I would say that is a problem as a whole with blizzard games. HOTs was a super chill fun game then it got ruined by Esports
[1:45:48] 1manpizza: The concept of OW2 is kind of crazy
[1:46:02] Siggenlh: only a couple of years?
[1:46:04] Reijm11: I mean who hadn't difficult years at blizzard except for thos on top
[1:46:09] Incredible_Sausage: nope. don't like that.
[1:46:11] Siggenlh: is this a robot?
[1:46:12] AdamBadr1: ijp5HEAD

[1:46:18] 1manpizza: Can we get Kayne and the Weeknd to read this?
[1:46:19] Munetani_NJimha: Futuuuuure
[1:46:21] xhaven: I dont understand how most players of OW can see that the focus on esports was bad for the game but the devs/company cant
[1:46:32] MrDigitalCypher: that is so fulent
[1:46:33] Cygnatus: this is how i'll communicate in ow2
[1:46:44] IronFistOfChina: Is she a Robot?
[1:46:48] ranin: i mean icefrogs been working at dotes for almost 20 years so there's a lot of work to go through to get a game with unique characters and balance
[1:46:51] jeffrey_characterwheaties: lol
[1:47:01] ElSpartin: text to spech @IronFistOfChina

[1:47:11] Siggenlh: insert a jim sterling episode an you are likely to land on a blizzard is bad episode.
[1:47:22] IronFistOfChina: @ElSpartin Yeah took me a sec
[1:47:24] 1manpizza: @xhaven they were selling multi-million buy ins to league. Potential income and esports buzzwords for investors
[1:47:24] mephium: I wonder how much of a loss that OWL is costing blizzard, like riot's lol esports stuff
[1:47:57] xhaven: @1manpizza yea FeelsBadMan
[1:48:12] Siggenlh: nothing is more annoying having to crunch to a date then it getting postponned. all that unesecary suffering for nothing
[1:48:17] Booba__TV: ijpPOGGERS
[1:48:18] The_Faceless_Void: @mephium I dont think the cost sink for riots league is as bad as OWL will ever be
[1:48:29] mephium: oh I see
[1:48:39] ranin: why would owl cost blizz?
[1:48:41] AdamBadr1: JP going to be playing OW all summer PauseChamp
[1:48:41] atern: @itmeJP Hey, what's your shelving system?
[1:48:50] Tezius: yeah they opted out of updating OW1 to get OW2 out, then had to delay OW2 so both just kind of stagnated?
[1:48:51] Rhikaroo: @mephium i think in the long run they lost money, but the upfront payment of OWL was 90m from twitch 10m per team
[1:49:01] NinjaPandaEU: A few devs have been tweeting the past few weeks that the execs at ActiBlizz have several times changed the orders for the dev team. Focus on PvP, then focus on PvE, then back the PvP, etc.
[1:49:09] ranin: aren't the teams paying for everything anyway?
[1:49:22] The_Faceless_Void: @ranin the contract with youtube to broadcast OWL matches might be one thing that would cost them plus if no fans then no merch money as well
[1:49:33] Siggenlh: how they gonna test anything of note if the beta got so little new content. aint they been testing the balancing for a while with the aplha?
[1:50:03] SkylerKK: Oh shit I thought this was trailer time
[1:50:08] Shoaron: TT hypeE
[1:50:09] BlueSapphyre: saints row, yes?
[1:50:11] Josh902: A Stellaris trailer came out a bit ago those are usually pretty good
[1:50:13] ranin: @The_Faceless_Void isn't it the other way around? youtube paying blizz more than twitch to get that contract?
[1:50:13] The_Faceless_Void: oh that wasnt TT?

[2:34:57] 1manpizza: #BeYourOwnBoss
[2:35:00] ranin: Game devs still haven't made the ultimate BR experience where instead of shrinking the map, the player characters got bigger!
[2:35:00] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord

[2:37:29] raptorscream: who is this game for?

[2:37:34] xLichdenheim: JimRobs LUL
[2:37:42] Thrishmal: So, question is, did they make the actual gameplay look better?
[2:37:45] BlueSapphyre: @raptorscream me.

[2:38:22] GrateWhiteDope: looks like more nonsense fun
[2:38:27] raptorscream: @eniGzor nah, this is trying to do GTA 5 + Fortnite
[2:38:28] 1manpizza: Saints Row games are so different from 2 to 3 to 4, the fanbase will never agree on what a saints row game is
[2:38:31] Miros__: Rockstar took too long with GTA6, so Saint's Row gonna try to get in on that sweet, sweet GTAO money
[2:38:35] rich16bit: yeah they needed this in Cyberpunk
[2:38:35] Tobin: is this saints row?
[2:38:36] Cephyric: eniGzor Make sense,, since the entire SR franchise is a satirical take of the GTA series
[2:38:39] SgtStruthers: Always had way more fun in Saints row than GTA
[2:38:40] DagooX: guitar rocket launcher POGGER
[2:38:41] BroqRox: AYAYA skins

[2:40:01] TheSteelWizard09: Makes me want to replay SR3
[2:40:01] yrvengalied: @yrvengalied that is why i wanted them to work on the game more than the customization
[2:40:02] BigWaldo7713: ya
[2:40:02] AwesomeKingPho: GTA: Fortnite Edition!
[2:40:03] BlueSapphyre: hyped*
[2:40:03] BaldurCZ: what i liked about Saint Row games was the silly dumb story and characters, hope it still will be there
[2:40:03] Archangel3003: Ok I'm now sold on this game just from the customization! I enjoyed Saints Row 3 & 4 so as long as it's simmilar or better gameplay then great.
[2:40:04] Grazzy21: looks good
[2:40:05] HermitPeanut79: DOA
[2:40:06] NinjaPandaEU: I have no bloody idea what Saints Row is but this trailer looks fun.

[2:40:18] Needleinahaystack: it still look sooooo generic to me...

[2:40:23] Snowfunk: DoA
[2:40:27] BroqRox: I remeber on 3 that you had a tank battle with an airplane that makes a zombie apocalypse run wild in the city

[2:42:35] espi: its an expansion
[2:42:36] DagooX: more options
[2:42:36] raptorscream: Stellaris, neverending
[2:42:36] ghostsofcarcosa: its stuff to make vassal and conquest more detailed I think
[2:42:36] Necroe: more stellaris
[2:42:37] 1manpizza: new mechanics?
[2:42:39] b0ksah: you start as a race with a overlord
[2:42:42] Omid18: new mechanics
[2:42:44] boxofpants: little bit of everything
[2:42:44] Korhazen: @itmeJP the DLC is focused on later game, Empire ruling etc
[2:42:47] ghostsofcarcosa: New mechanics
[2:42:47] k0jak: yeah usually new mechanics
[2:42:50] Darkaros: there's even more ai mini-factions to lord over, so you can send mercenaries etc
[2:42:53] Grazzy21: new mechanics and the usal overhaul
[2:42:55] Siggenlh: we dont know yet LUL @itmeJP there aint been enoguh devblogs
[2:42:56] Munetani_NJimha: Paradox DLCs is generally more mechanics
[2:43:01] DagooX: it looks like spying
[2:43:03] OuroborosChemist: i think they overhaul whole vassal/subject system
[2:43:04] Mrshilka: its a entire rework of the empire system with subjagation
[2:43:11] ThaSandus: so next tier kinda?
[2:43:13] Bagrym: my guess would be, try to conquer the galaxy as emperor, fight against traitors, backstabbers and heretics, while alien race undermines your base of power
[2:43:16] Incredible_Sausage: cool that the mechanics are modular like that and they can just plug it in
[2:43:18] Mrshilka: you can have slave races of sdcientists
[2:43:23] Omid18: Pog
[2:43:23] k0jak: maylaris
[2:43:28] BigWaldo7713: D:

[2:45:08] Reijm11: People forget that hey never ment this to be a gaas so they don't need constant high player numbers as long as people come back for the dlc
[2:45:10] yokaiartist: oh no i am*
[2:45:11] Jukettaja: I keep hearing Ewoks

[2:47:53] afreak10: and then they will nerf it
[2:47:54] AinzN: Shoaron I think that was one of the reasons I didn't get the game as I play in a group of 4
[2:47:59] Incredible_Sausage: i'm not
[2:48:06] JuloFreeq: i exchanged my outriders for guardians of galaxy

[2:48:43] BigWaldo7713: the game was super janky
[2:48:43] MythGameStream: It just ended.  End Game wasn't much.

[2:58:39] Archangel3003: @BigWaldo7713 Published by 2K Games and developed in-house. So some people are not holding they're breath for them to do a good story heavy game.
[2:58:45] the_real_beardcat: is there some way to watch yesterdays VOD? or is the twitch DMCA situation still a mess?
[2:59:12] AinzN: the_real_beardcat I think they are under highlights now?
[2:59:17] The_Faceless_Void: !vods2
[2:59:17] itmeBOT: PSA: Twitch is automatically unpublishing VODs, and we must manually edit/highlight them after checking if there's DMCA content that prompted Twitch to unpublish it in the first place. It may be a few hours after the end of a broadcast before we can reupload them. YouTube uploads will continue at usual pace. Thanks for your patience! https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1512149573581656070
[2:59:17] AltraWolf: That's very true,  I just remember you banning Shaco more than Yi
[2:59:21] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:59:29] MaStAmUd: MaStAmUd subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[2:59:29] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing MaStAmUd! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
