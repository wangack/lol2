[0:39:03] Doctor_Von_Decency: @itmeJP rubber band man song was aptly picked for Infinity War considering rubber bands SNAP.. Thanos is rubberband man confirmed
[0:39:19] townm79: Immigrant Song used in Ragnarok was the best
[0:39:25] ThemDemo: Groot is also adult groot again
[0:39:25] BigWaldo7713: COSMO <3
[0:39:34] Osskssa: Kosmo

[0:40:19] Miros__: Calling it: Cosmo is actually Loki-variant trying to get close to Thor to talk about how he fucked up the multiverse
[0:40:20] Osskssa: he would be 20s
[0:40:23] ThemDemo: Kraglin's got his new look

[0:41:23] LFC_Letters: bronze......
[0:41:23] DyingEros: Hands down
[0:41:25] Legionnare92: did this episode feel weird to anyone else?
[0:41:26] Ceaseless_: here comes the hate lol
[0:41:28] Osskssa: it was great
[0:41:33] Omid18: agreed with bronze
[0:41:34] DobbsjustDobbs: Oh god
[0:41:36] iilu: Yep, with Bronze
[0:41:37] DyingEros: The yell of "WAKE UP" made me feel some kind of way
[0:41:38] KingNightOwl: the first half was very slow
[0:41:38] Toscacake: yep
[0:41:39] Darbee: i agree with bronze
[0:41:43] ruiyolas: i agree with bronze
[0:41:44] rapidshot20: i'm with bronze
[0:41:47] sch1z0: LUL
[0:41:49] DyingEros: I agree with Bronze
[0:41:49] m3rcer: I agree
[0:41:49] poooookey: it was indy
[0:41:51] hollysephiroth: I agree first half was boring
[0:41:52] TheAetherParadox: I fell asleep in the first half on my first watch... ngl
[0:41:52] aznhai: bronze gang
[0:41:52] Sir_Myrmidon: PopCorn
[0:41:54] DyingEros: Its plodding and meh
[0:41:54] DobbsjustDobbs: Bronze not a fan of Indiana Jones
[0:41:56] Osskssa: i loved first half
[0:41:57] Eristaios: i agree
[0:41:58] Omid18: ep 3 and first half of this episode were lower quality than the rest of the show
[0:41:59] Gorn_Vernaleer: true! first half is bad
[0:41:59] kazen01: first half was the mummy / indiana jones
[0:41:59] Exokaz: here we go...
[0:42:02] HereForPizza: ijpNODDERS
[0:42:03] Keynass: it was sooo dumb
[0:42:03] shiddass_andy: nope, 1st half was the best
[0:42:04] Legionnare92: i would have enjoyed if they let it hang "wait was it all in his head" at the end of the episode
[0:42:07] skythe00: where does the first half end?
[0:42:07] darth_derpius: I thought the 3rd ep was ass, and ep4 always all great
[0:42:10] DobbsjustDobbs: Disagreed
[0:42:12] Lord_Beardmeister: b movie vibes, sure.
[0:42:18] Ravnim: this only has that one stupid scene the rest was awesome
[0:42:21] Gorn_Vernaleer: so boring till the last half
[0:42:25] Sonatta: that's my problem with the very beginning of Rogue One with Cassian... looks cheap
[0:42:28] reboot2099: The first half was fun, and the second was great, but both in the same episode was really weird. It should've been 2 episodes
[0:42:30] Osskssa: @skythe00 im guessing after h gets shot
[0:42:51] DD_The_Shmey: I thought the mummy fight was cool
[0:42:54] Zrmi: I think it was written 'bad' B movie dumb on purpose... But I didnt like it also
[0:42:57] PlaguesV2: I thought that but steven was in control not marc
[0:43:00] skythe00: i'd say it was slow until they split up and then it gets good
[0:43:06] ruiyolas: when the "zombies" appear, then it becomes great
[0:43:10] SabertoothEwok: Layla and Marc/Steven are not smart in this show
[0:43:26] DobbsjustDobbs: They have 3 episodes, Bronze
[0:43:27] abagofpudding: the heka priests looked so gooood
[0:43:27] b0ksah: They act like dumb horror movie actors
[0:43:47] DD_The_Shmey: yeah
[0:43:54] Eristaios: ijpNODDERS
[0:43:57] bobislost: they were already proceeding with caution
[0:43:57] m3rcer: dumb horror movie characters basically
[0:44:01] The_Faceless_Void: Yeah I‚Äôm with bronze
[0:44:05] DD_The_Shmey: they should have moved forward, clearly something supernatural
[0:44:06] LeelandGrant: they where more acting like tourists than everyone else
[0:44:06] RyanV97: It's kinda like, why would you have the characters find that info and then *not* do anything with it
[0:44:09] CorporalPibb: they noticed the obviously trapped corridor at least
[0:44:12] KingNightOwl: That mummy was giving me clicker vibes, loved that part
[0:44:12] DobbsjustDobbs: But what would you have them do?
[0:44:14] appaomega: Layla doesn't realize how dumb Stephen is
[0:44:20] Osskssa: yeah they were cautious even Steven suggested not going down the bloody tunnel
[0:44:23] appaomega: She was ready, no planning needed
[0:44:24] jeffhunter12: i assumed it was harrow doing the embalming at first
[0:44:34] Crafteroon: Seeing an old sacrifice prep table is okay, finding fresh blood is not.
[0:44:41] madxxtitan: Bron nitpicking and hates everything as usual
[0:44:55] Zrmi: The world isnt real though.. It's a B movie imagination of Steven
[0:44:57] Osskssa: @Crafteroon not for sacrifices, for mummification
[0:45:04] Xanctius: But it has to be relatable to us, and if we cant relate to any of the characters, it becomes too foreign
[0:45:08] LeelandGrant: i found it strange how they geeked out but where not cautious
[0:45:16] Ravnim: marc was screaming for them to gtfo but only behind the mirror
[0:45:17] JusticetoAll: Maybe one line along the lines of "Well Steven... Mark... what ever, you don't have the suite now so... be careful"
[0:45:21] Omid18: agreed with bronze.
[0:45:30] sch1z0: KEKW
[0:45:31] BaosilisK: @madxxtitan she is right tho, there was those scene of them anylizing stuff but it didn't sticked on the paper LUL
[0:45:36] Crafteroon: @Osskssa I like to think of my tables as multi-purpose.
[0:45:38] Aegorax22: They did try to avoid the blood trail, but took there sweet time about it
[0:45:40] DD_The_Shmey: Lets talk about the 4,000 wood scaffolding that had not decayed to dust
[0:45:46] Legionnare92: but also that undead priest or wtvr.... it was so inconsequential
[0:45:46] skythe00: they split up cause they were looking for a way to go that wasnt down the blood tunnel
[0:45:48] ThemDemo: I mean their entire lives are devoted to archeology, they would be excited to see this stuff
[0:45:50] Osskssa: Bronze Steven saw the blood and said lets go another way
[0:45:54] DD_The_Shmey: 4000 year old
[0:45:57] Legionnare92: it provided not hign but a "lets show layla be cool"
[0:46:02] Osskssa: @Crafteroon from Ikea? lol
[0:46:04] skythe00: the jeep ambush was dumb though
[0:46:11] Farfic: I had no issues with the darkness
[0:46:14] Zrmi: wasnt that dark at all LUL
[0:46:15] darth_derpius: do u guys think the "sky turning" from ep3 was visible and affected the entire world? bc that's more egregious than the eternals ocean man if so lol
[0:46:19] Darbee: the ambush wasn't needed at all
[0:46:26] DobbsjustDobbs: The ambush was really dumb
[0:46:26] Keynass: that sounds like a badly adjusted monitor
[0:46:29] LeelandGrant: how did she know throwing that torch woud set up bullets? She could not see that they where up there
[0:46:36] oPH0EN1Xo: i dont think its as bad as bronze says. Oscar isaac played it well. he played an awkward nervous perspective that fit the situation. i think it was a good scene and totally more foreboding than expected in a Disney show @itmejp
[0:46:37] Osskssa: @darth_derpius yes everyone saw, they showed people seeing
[0:46:46] Crafteroon: @Osskssa The egyptian tomb tables just aren't easy to clean.
[0:46:48] Jingleheimer1: quietest and weakest 50 cal machine gun at the start
[0:46:48] Hundisilm: That would be super weird
[0:46:49] jeffhunter12: the romance is weird but funny
[0:46:50] Bitghost_: they're just going to be poly, no big deal
[0:46:57] darth_derpius: @osskssa they showed people in Cairo afaik
[0:47:05] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[0:47:10] Hundisilm: What do you do if your wife cheats on you with you
[0:47:24] Hundisilm: While you are looking
[0:47:26] Osskssa: @darth_derpius well i imagine only people where it was night would notice? lol
[0:47:26] synthetik666: i had one where issue mark seems to make steven hit himself, but i didnt even think he could do that. i thought only konshu could
[0:47:33] ruiyolas: still weird, marc didn't consent
[0:47:41] synthetik666: one issue where*
[0:47:45] 0GHammer: I loved that punch in the face he gave himself LUL
[0:47:46] skythe00: yeah that was neat
[0:48:09] abagofpudding: i squealed when the alexander reveal happened
[0:48:16] Omid18: how did she even see that
[0:48:20] Drakoni23: Brought ALL the artillary but then not using it to just perforate the car Jebaited
[0:48:23] CorporalPibb: a flare wouldn't do that
[0:48:30] LeelandGrant: how would she even know the bullets are there?
[0:48:30] skythe00: she must be in the jeep? should we riddle the jeep with bullets? We got hundred? Nah just drive around the wrong way
[0:48:35] AN71V1RU5: flare would not do that without accelerant
[0:48:35] Xanctius: No, they wouldnt
[0:48:36] Ricstitch: no
[0:48:36] RuleofBooKz: in a comic they would
[0:48:36] DyingEros: Yeah, def not the best opening half.
[0:48:37] Ceaseless_: maybe some under the intense heat
[0:48:38] Osskssa: yes
[0:48:38] CorporalPibb: a molotov maybe
[0:48:39] ruiyolas: they wouldn't for sure
[0:48:41] Redvelvet84: they SHOULDNT, but could
[0:48:41] BaosilisK: no LUL
[0:48:43] Hundisilm: They were super anti mummy bullets
[0:48:45] DyingEros: Once they make it into the maze tho its really good.
[0:48:49] SolAlpha3: you can see the whole truck unlike a camera
[0:48:49] SpaceDive: unlikely
[0:48:55] ArcheRazor_: they certainly dont blow like fireworks LUL
[0:49:00] Hundisilm: It was a Toyota perhaps
[0:49:04] Osskssa: flares are super hot 1,600 ¬∞C
[0:49:11] Omid18: nah you right bronze
[0:49:13] MythGameStream: She had a can of Fix-it-Engine.
[0:49:15] Zrmi: Layla should have been hit by flying bullets after that explosion also
[0:49:17] ItsNoxid: it do be a toyota
[0:49:19] Masterpug13: It is possible (and likely) that it is goofy because it is all in his head. He was unconscious, so he just 'made up' what she did while he was out.
[0:49:21] Affly01: it was just such a useless scene that sets up nothing and is full of dumb stuff
[0:49:29] ruiyolas: nah bronze's right
[0:49:31] RuleofBooKz: hard to get good help
[0:49:31] Keynass: 50. cal goes through steel plates, car wouldnt even make it stutter
[0:49:32] LeelandGrant: that whole scene was dumb and served NO purpose
[0:49:46] LeelandGrant: What would have been lost if this whole scene did not happen?
[0:49:47] yunggoon1: atpBigot
[0:49:49] skythe00: the only thing it setup is Layla using flares which she does once in the tomb lol
[0:49:57] NinjaXI: theyre literally cult members, they cant be smart
[0:50:02] allAshees: I love when they paint the goons as badass mercenaries and they suck
[0:50:05] kasded: KEKW
[0:50:06] JosieSprings: LUL
[0:50:07] oPH0EN1Xo: that doesnt make them any less stupid
[0:50:08] shadowoflight_: why I really, really appreciate the incredibles, all the goons were smart, even mind controlled zombies were smart
[0:50:09] Zrmi: But it's all written like a adventure B movie, on purpose I think
[0:50:10] Hundisilm: People are stupid Bronze
[0:50:12] DobbsjustDobbs: Cultists are stupid, Bronze
[0:50:21] azazelmoriarty: it's like police if your iq is too high they don't hire you
[0:50:22] kynon5097: The followers that never passed an intelligence check
[0:50:30] DobbsjustDobbs: There's only one smart person in a Cult
[0:50:42] Malanor85: Well THERES your Problem, Thinking!
[0:50:45] Darbee: yep
[0:50:48] Legionnare92: i couldnt get over Steven walking into one room and going "wait this whole place is shaped like this!"
[0:50:48] zymioi: BUT its cool for kids tho lol
[0:50:50] appaomega: Nah, shes a killer
[0:50:55] Ravnim: action scene aren't that great in this show
[0:51:06] oPH0EN1Xo: theyre just trying to show that she can handle herself in dangerous situations.
[0:51:10] Hundisilm: It shows she's super boss girl
[0:51:18] Osskssa: Black Widow action scences were interesting? whut?
[0:51:25] abagofpudding: layla was giving very much final girl in the beginning of the episode
[0:51:34] Doctor_Von_Decency: @Legionnare92 yeah that was tough hahaha
[0:51:37] Zrmi: @Osskssa At least Yelena was interesting to look at LUL
[0:51:38] CorporalPibb: she's already proven to be a badass in the last episode and when fighting the mummy
[0:51:46] MarcusUno: Moon Knight BatChest
[0:51:54] Osskssa: @Zrmi true she was best thing in that
[0:52:03] Ravnim: I was waiting for marc to swoop in and save her but it was nice she was able save herself
[0:52:07] KingNightOwl: good point
[0:52:21] DyingEros: Layla Croft KEKW
[0:52:36] zymioi: every part with a silly action part is for the alpha man and child who looking for a good time LUL
[0:52:48] ThemDemo: I loved the horror elements in this episode. My wife was actively hiding under the covers during it LUL
[0:52:59] Hundisilm: To be fair to the goons - if I had a machine gun - I wouldn't be very scared of a girl under a truck
[0:53:13] DyingEros: Yeah the zombie was scary
[0:53:13] Ravnim: yup monkaS
[0:53:23] Bitghost_: that jump scare actually scared the shit out of me
[0:53:24] DD_The_Shmey: yeah
[0:53:24] DyingEros: The clicks and the dragging Layla back into the dark
[0:53:25] appaomega: up close scary too
[0:53:27] DD_The_Shmey: clicks were good
[0:53:30] DyingEros: I was on the edge of my seat
[0:53:32] Xanctius: Ripped off Predator
[0:53:33] Zrmi: clicking was the jaws because they have no tongue
[0:53:34] nijntuu: very last of us clickers
[0:53:36] KingNightOwl: the clicks were awesome
[0:53:45] LeelandGrant: i hated jpw the mummy got her. There is a mummy behind the wall and trying to get you through cracks and you are then standing with your back to that wall in front of a shadow?
[0:53:50] DyingEros: I liked it lol
[0:54:03] SabertoothEwok: That is not unique to Last of Us at all. Monsters be clicking long before that
[0:54:04] Exokaz: guess last of us stole ecco location
[0:54:04] shadowoflight_: nah, sounded good but not echo location
[0:54:05] DobbsjustDobbs: It worked, that's what matters
[0:54:08] SilverNiKr: was Naughty Dog the first to make echolocating enemies?
[0:54:25] KatjeMauw: SilverNiKr hell nah
[0:54:25] abagofpudding: the use of practical camera tricks during the zombie parts made me so happy
[0:54:26] ThemDemo: Their tongues are removed in the embalming process so yeah very disturbing sounds haha
[0:54:33] crypticnightwing21: Don't they cut tongues out on a mummy
[0:54:43] KingNightOwl: yeah I didnt think it was Eccho location just a weird disturbing sounds
[0:54:46] Masterpug13: Spoiler, the whole show has been this. XD It's all a delusion.
[0:55:20] Hundisilm: That was very Legionish :p
[0:55:22] LeelandGrant: i was hoping they would open the third cofin
[0:55:28] Legionnare92: how do you NOT open the OTHER sarcophagus, after steven was trapped in the first one! explicitly looked at and ignored it lmao
[0:55:29] ThemDemo: That room is the same room from episode 2 when steven is pushed out the window
[0:55:30] DrTazerFace: Is it a 6 episode thing again?
[0:55:41] Ricstitch: if only this season had 16 episodes...
[0:55:42] VTuberThighsChokeVictim: Tawret, lets goo
[0:55:46] DyingEros: The last 10 mins are the best
[0:55:51] DyingEros: I was entranced.
[0:55:54] MythGameStream: I was waiting for Legion to appear.
[0:55:57] DyingEros: Yeah, I thought that was the real world.
[0:56:06] abagofpudding: i think it's real, but in the overvoid
[0:56:09] awgwab: I like the idea that it is sorta the afterlife
[0:56:12] DobbsjustDobbs: I am so happy it wasn't the real world
[0:56:13] skythe00: yeah there was a real few minutes where you're like "oh shit... is it all in his head?"
[0:56:15] jeffhunter12: nah the place looked too fake
[0:56:24] ReginaldXIV: ü¶õ Hi
[0:56:31] DrTazerFace: Ok. Bye
[0:56:37] sotasty_: what does the bingo game means? ijpHMM
[0:56:42] xelan_star: we will see jake in the next episode I am sure
[0:56:44] Zrmi: they have to free Konshu in the mind jail I guess
[0:56:48] ashla11: we already know there is a third persona right?
[0:56:52] RyanV97: The third coffin is probably Khonshu
[0:56:57] Drakoni23: Question: Is it happening in real time, slow or in the split second of him dying?
[0:56:58] Malanor85: I really wanna see, HOW deranged "Jake" is
[0:57:01] Bitghost_: I think the Hippo god helps them come together, like become more harmonious instead of fighting each other constantly
[0:57:06] abagofpudding: i feel like jake is gonna be a post credits
[0:57:07] LFC_Letters: unless there is a second series and they havent announced it yet
[0:57:14] MythGameStream: @itmeJP Did they ever determine who killed those guys when Mark woke up to take control and Stephen said he didn't do it?
[0:57:39] Ceaseless_: its to co-exist really
[0:57:39] abagofpudding: i think it's gonna embrace the "stronger together" thing
[0:57:39] MythGameStream: Konchu or third personality?
[0:57:46] appaomega: Do you think Marc let Stephen die?
[0:57:53] ThemDemo: I think they will be flipping back and forth a lot more and faster as we continue
[0:57:54] appaomega: or vice versa?
[0:57:59] nijntuu: aren't they in the field of reeds right now?
[0:58:00] DyingEros: His love is going to kill her
[0:58:08] jeffhunter12: third personality exists as they were the one that asked the coworker out
[0:58:18] DyingEros: I think she knows Konshu is coming for her
[0:58:40] Legionnare92: but its weird cuz its not resolved? he said it was his partner not him, but shes mad he didnt stop him
[0:59:01] azazelmoriarty: nah it's different
[0:59:03] DobbsjustDobbs: She's mad cause the reason they are together is his guilt for her father's death
[0:59:14] Osskssa: WW 1984 was horrible
[0:59:23] Rawrsong: Body Snatching is different situation
[0:59:35] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[0:59:41] Zrmi: Or she never really like Mark but his looks Kappa
[0:59:46] skythe00: zekeKEK LOL
[0:59:46] Hundisilm: I don't like the lovesick plotline from Wonder Woman - it feels weird somehow
[1:00:03] DyingEros: Facts
[1:00:06] Osskssa: it was Zack!
[1:00:09] Bob__Z: She wants the mystery
[1:00:11] Lord_Beardmeister: Aerith is a one-man woman and Cloud thinks he's that guy be really isn't
[1:00:14] ruiyolas: Eh, shipping a dead person doesn't matter PepeLaugh
[1:00:41] KingNightOwl: LMAO
[1:00:46] Ravnim: LUL
[1:00:47] Hundisilm: Are they two people for her or is it more that its the one same person that is a bit wonky
[1:00:47] appaomega: It looked like she realized the difference and then went forward with it
[1:00:55] Osskssa: almost kissed her nostrils
[1:00:56] DyingEros: He's so hot and I couldn't believe he did such a bad kiss lol
[1:00:59] yrvengalied: ijpKEK
[1:01:01] DyingEros: It was like....wut
[1:01:04] KingNightOwl: the Steven kiss did look a little yikes
[1:01:09] DyingEros: After he gets shot. Whew.
[1:01:16] elderdrai: he is an amazing actor!!
[1:01:17] Zrmi: He's a good actor but I don't like him in this role to be honest.. for some reason I'd rather have seen him play a different hero
[1:01:17] WayneG947: Steven for speaking to, Marc for sex. She has the best life
[1:01:22] Ceaseless_: just shows how much star wars fucked him lol
[1:01:25] appaomega: yaaaaaa
[1:01:34] DyingEros: BINGO
[1:01:35] DyingEros: Its amazing
[1:01:40] ilsombrero: I¬¥m still waiting for the reveal that everything is a movie funded by Steven Grant, would also explain why some things look so incredibly jarring
[1:01:44] Ravnim: ooo, 2 bullet for both personalities
[1:01:46] jeffhunter12: him talking and drawing the horus eye was great too
[1:01:48] Tremert: I think Steven is a personallity that creates Mark to shield himself, and he copies the best person he knows: Layla, that's why Steven is so similar to her, cause he's copiying her personallity as a good person like
[1:02:05] itmeBOT:  We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info:  https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[1:02:29] LeelandGrant: lets see how they end it first
[1:02:31] LFC_Letters: yeah casting is amazing... everyone is great
[1:02:32] DD_The_Shmey: really good editing too. I wonder how many takes they do of the different personalities before they find the right one to put into the final cut
[1:02:35] shiddass_andy: you cant get better than loki
[1:02:45] AN71V1RU5: I'm rewatching Loki, every episode is amazing
[1:02:49] Osskssa: i hated loki it sucked so boring
[1:02:51] aLi3nVPuPPiEs: wandavision is way better than loki
[1:03:00] zymioi: loki was great i watch it last week
[1:03:05] Drakoni23: Loki just does the thing. Love it
[1:03:07] DobbsjustDobbs: He'd been in 4 movies LUL
[1:03:10] skythe00: yeh each episode of Loki clips along great, the only kinda slow one is 3
[1:03:14] Zrmi: We didnt know Loki that well though
[1:03:16] AN71V1RU5: Wandavision takes half the show to get anywhere.
[1:03:22] zymioi: the hair flip get me every time lol
[1:03:30] Spools_: Moonknight is on the screen for about 5% of his own show ResidentSleeper
[1:03:48] Rawrsong: Poe Dameron, much like damn near every other sequel trilogy character, got done dirty
[1:03:50] DD_The_Shmey: Loki was the best
[1:03:53] Osskssa: @Spools_ cept he is cos Marc is moonknight
[1:03:59] ReginaldXIV: It had slow moments of just people talking too which doesn't happen often in the MCU
[1:03:59] DD_The_Shmey: ijpNODDERS
[1:04:15] Hundisilm: I was thinking why there was no moonknight last episode, but it was because Konshu is gone right?
[1:04:21] Osskssa: yes
[1:04:26] Osskssa: so no suit
[1:04:31] Drakoni23: Moon Knight is still an origin story even tho Marc has been Moon Knight for a long time. Because our in into the story was Steven who just gets to know everything.
[1:04:37] DyingEros: Yes no suit to Konshu comes back
[1:04:39] LeelandGrant: Wandavison reminds me of "in Bruges". The first half is boring as hell and the second half shows you why the first half was not boring at all LUL
[1:04:41] abagofpudding: MoM is also a two hour sam ramis movie so i trust that it's just gonna rip
[1:04:54] Malanor85: K A A N G!
[1:04:58] LFC_Letters: Scarlet Witch's story is just starting...
[1:05:02] abagofpudding: raimi
[1:05:03] kasded: kasded subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! woohoo
[1:05:03] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing kasded! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[1:05:09] DD_The_Shmey: true @Malanor85 I want to see Kang in this
[1:05:20] appaomega: Chthon
[1:05:20] DaRandalizer: Will they feature the different movie scenes from the lemire comic? Maybe the budget went there?
[1:05:36] PlayWithMonsters: eggyWiggle
[1:05:36] Bob__Z: We didn‚Äôt need the first 2 episodes honestly
[1:05:55] LFC_Letters: @DaRandalizer theres some more trailer footage which hasnt been shown yet but I wouldnt expect a ton more
[1:05:55] itmeBOT: New Tweet from itmeJP:- We'll have drops on our channel for OW2 access Wednesday! Go like and retweet... https://twitter.com/itmeJP/status/1518656114061201409
[1:06:10] Drakoni23: Watched a video from someone with DID talking about the show. The alters are there to protect the host and one way they do that is by altering memories, to put them away and move on.
[1:06:33] jeffhunter12: the asylum looks super unreal
[1:06:34] ThemDemo: Its the same room from ep 2
[1:06:40] ThemDemo: when steven is pushed out the window
[1:06:42] ashla11: really?  I thin it would creep me out
[1:06:48] DyingEros: Ethan Hawke killed it man. So calm and so scary
[1:07:06] DD_The_Shmey: really @ThemDemo are you sure?
[1:07:14] tkcross21: do we think the asylum is real world?
[1:07:19] ThemDemo: Yeah someone did a comparison, Ill look for it
[1:07:28] sotasty_: ijpKEK
[1:07:35] Ricstitch: Who is the hippo lady?
[1:07:43] DyingEros: @ThemDemo I'm interested in seeing that too
[1:07:45] DD_The_Shmey: another god @Ricstitch
[1:07:46] DobbsjustDobbs: She's the goddess of Rebirth
[1:07:52] Osskssa: @tkcross21 no cos Steven is ther too
[1:08:01] CorporalPibb: compared to Konshu's ominous god voice
[1:08:06] DyingEros: The scream was perfet
[1:08:06] Hundisilm: That hippo is cute though
[1:08:08] xelan_star: different screams too
[1:08:09] DyingEros: *perfect
[1:08:12] DyingEros: I lost it lol
[1:08:21] Zrmi: they finally synced
[1:08:24] Ceaseless_: she helps them heal and thats ep 5 lol
[1:08:26] Osskssa: she is
[1:08:26] jeffhunter12: the screaming made it for me
[1:08:30] Drakoni23: I like the little overlap in the Split Screen to try sell Isaac being in the same room twice
[1:08:37] crypticnightwing21: She got credit for ep 5 and 6
[1:08:38] Quemi_Totl: Heavy Spoilers on youtube has a video on how ep1-3 has all been a "dream"
[1:09:04] FrozanFlames: She is a physical opposite of ammit so I feel she is going to want to help.
[1:09:05] raptorscream: Hippo godess is in the next 2 eps
[1:09:10] tkcross21: @osskssa  fair , I just wonder if it could be hallucinations
[1:09:14] PlaguesV2: At the end credit scene she was in the statue thing like khonshu during the credits @itmeJP
[1:09:20] raptorscream: and she's teh goddess of fertility
[1:09:21] CCLone: Tawaret doesn't have an established lore in the marvel comics universe, so they can do anything with her
[1:09:26] Altair900: I think for episode 5 she has to help Marc and Steven heal, but in order to heal, they have to let the third person out of the other sarcophagus, so he can be whole
[1:09:28] Quemi_Totl: incl how harrow physh office is the room from earlier
[1:09:43] Legionnare92: there were a LOT of stone imprisoned gods. wonder if they all get out when konshu gets free
[1:09:45] WayneG947: She is birth and motherhood vs Ammit's death and soulstealer
[1:10:06] Osskssa: she isnt one of the big gods in egypt a lesser god
[1:10:28] FrozanFlames: @WayneG947 exactly plus the animals she is built out of are actually opposite parts.
[1:10:29] Masterpug13: They are both 'dead' or passing into the afterlife.
[1:10:35] Gorn_Vernaleer: I kinda thought the hippo was related to the nice girl from the council
[1:10:38] Drakoni23: Still not sure if it's all in Marc's head or in some sort of Limbo
[1:10:40] kazen01: so many gods were statued
[1:10:40] crypticnightwing21: They could be a version of a underworld
[1:10:41] Zrmi: Maybe they can be in mind worlds but not physical world
[1:10:48] aLi3nVPuPPiEs: i get the feeling that this asylum is the underworld and all of the gods that are banished are there too
[1:10:53] yodelrodel: Someone on twitter did a breakdown of all the statues, I don't think the hippo one was mentioned
[1:10:56] raptorscream: Undevoid
[1:10:56] Osskssa: @Gorn_Vernaleer nope thats Hathor
[1:11:01] raptorscream: or something like that
[1:11:07] Zrmi: I think they have to break out Konshu in the nut house too though
[1:11:11] nijntuu: field of reeds, like the little girl said in the first episode
[1:11:24] Masterpug13: Yeah, field of reeds.
[1:11:29] FrozanFlames: Well he is dead so I think the implication he is in the "after life" which is the pocket dimension I think they are just not allowed to leave there once stoned but who knows for sure its left pretty vague
[1:11:51] Averagejoe007: I loved that they foreshadowed Tavaret in the gift shop as well lol
[1:11:53] PlaguesV2: @itmeJP I twitted a picture of the credits to you
[1:12:10] Masterpug13: IMO, the whole series so far has been Mark/Steven passing through the field of reeds.
[1:12:29] Sir_Myrmidon: uh oh
[1:12:31] DD_The_Shmey: @PlaguesV2 can you post it in chat?
[1:12:32] Rawrsong: Oh no
[1:12:35] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:12:36] ritchie313: this better not be a twilight thing were it's all in your head
[1:12:36] CorporalPibb: ijpONO
[1:12:36] FrozanFlames: @Masterpug13 that would be trippy LUL
[1:12:37] Sonatta: we going deeeeeep when we reference Lost
[1:12:41] Heisuisui: lost fans? modCheck
[1:12:42] DD_The_Shmey: your tweet @PlaguesV2
[1:12:42] Robz8: YEP
[1:12:53] PlaguesV2: @DD_The_Shmey ill dm you it
[1:12:56] Hundisilm: what?
[1:12:57] tkcross21: Lost is now MCU canon ?
[1:13:04] nullv: so we're going back to the island?
[1:13:08] trashthalk: We have to go back
[1:13:09] zestyzanzil: Harrow has a specific line as the therapist where he says something like: ‚Äúwe live in a mental world. We have little if any effect on the physical.‚Äù
[1:13:10] WayneG947: Oh shit yes, it is revealed in the end during a flashback
[1:13:14] Sonatta: we never left
[1:13:19] crypticnightwing21: @itmeJP But how has harrow had his powers while ammuet been stoned. So marc still should have some of Knoshu powers
[1:13:25] Rhuvian: Happy to say I never watched Lost.
[1:13:44] CorporalPibb: fertility and caretaking
[1:13:44] Doctor_Von_Decency: @itmeJP did you guys ever talk about the little girl in episode one asking steven if he was upset he wasn't deemed worthy after dying?
[1:13:45] Osskssa: @crypticnightwing21 its from the staff not Ammet
[1:13:51] Hundisilm: too good
[1:13:54] Zrmi: because the bad gods want to take over
[1:13:54] appaomega: For helping people
[1:13:58] FrozanFlames: @crypticnightwing21 assuming that IS ammuets powers and not something else
[1:14:00] LeelandGrant: because the bad guys are winning?
[1:14:05] sorescott: if Marc loses all powers when Konshu is stoned, how has Harrow got powers from Ammit?
[1:14:06] appaomega: Because of Lost
[1:14:10] appaomega: The banned her
[1:14:20] ReginaldXIV: She was ready to 1v1 Thanos
[1:14:21] Osskssa: @sorescott he dont its the staff
[1:14:22] trashthalk: rhuvian you're missing like... 4ish seasons of fun and then not much after that
[1:14:24] FrozanFlames: Wouldn't stop helping humans NODDERS
[1:14:27] ThemDemo: Here's the office comparison
[1:14:32] ThemDemo: https://cdn.realsport101.com/images/ncavvykf/epicstream/cffe24134d82e6a244a7dd64ac18cd9ee37ada13-650x400.jpg?w=650&h=400&auto=format&dpr=2
[1:14:37] ThemDemo: https://cdn.realsport101.com/images/ncavvykf/epicstream/5b0182dda5f66a5505db7d05a804ed9524a1dcbd-650x400.jpg?w=650&h=400&auto=format&dpr=2
[1:14:40] Zethgryn: maybe she interfered with Thanos snap, that would be cool
[1:14:49] Rhuvian: @trashthalk Yeah that's what I keep hearing. I hate getting into something and then having the rug pulled out. GoT killed me.
[1:14:56] sorescott: @Osskssa The scales on his arm happened without the staff though?
[1:14:56] DobbsjustDobbs: Oh wow it is that room
[1:15:09] Rawrsong: Could be a "No Gods, No Kings, Only Man" type situation
[1:15:14] ReginaldXIV: Isn't Anubis also a statue?
[1:15:18] FrozanFlames: A lot of Neutral in that group NODDERS
[1:15:18] DD_The_Shmey: ahhh @ThemDemo ijpNODDERS your right
[1:15:20] Osskssa: @sorescott always has the staff with him tho
[1:15:20] ThemDemo: Probly for production reasons, but yeah same room
[1:15:21] Drakoni23: Have you seen Oscar Isaac sing the Hippopotamus song on Jimmy Fallon's show? Which was out before Ep 4 and noone knew it was a sneak peek noone knew xD
[1:15:53] Zrmi: Well Zeus is coming to God and Thunder LUL
[1:15:53] LFC_Letters: Normally at this stage we know how each of the shows ends... so this is a great feeling
[1:15:59] DD_The_Shmey: oh i missed that @Drakoni23
[1:16:05] DD_The_Shmey: so cool
[1:16:07] Tyronin: There is no way they kill off gorr in one movie
[1:16:34] HadieHim: gorr is too cool for one movie
[1:16:48] Osskssa: @sorescott  ''The Staff of Ammit is a powerful staff embued with the power of Ammit that us used to judge people on their past, present, and future''
[1:17:06] Altair900: Other parts of the mcu will start diving into this stuff, we've gotta wait and see what they do with Gorr. hard to say
[1:17:11] Drakoni23: In the first episode Donna also said Steven would end up in a sarcophagus. Which he did in E4.
[1:17:17] Hundisilm: wasn't he involved int stoning of Ammit?
[1:17:21] Quemi_Totl: well it is Christian Bale. Maybe he only signed on for 1 movie
[1:17:33] LFC_Letters: cause he found him before...
[1:17:41] Sir_Myrmidon: yerp
[1:17:44] PlaguesV2: i thought he said "tell marc to free me"
[1:17:47] KingNightOwl: its happened before
[1:17:53] Bitghost_: well no he says tell mark to free me
[1:17:54] sorescott: @Osskssa Thanks!
[1:18:01] phrozenstar: @PlaguesV2 That is what he said
[1:18:03] Osskssa: he said to free me nothing bout where he is
[1:18:08] DD_The_Shmey: oh third coffin is definitly jake
[1:18:09] Averagejoe007: BOOM Clap
[1:18:12] jeffhunter12: he says "free me"
[1:18:16] Bellicosed: @DD_The_Shmey yeah
[1:18:22] trashthalk: Bronzes got BOXES of Pepe
[1:18:23] andaroo: WAYTOODANK
[1:18:34] Malanor85: will he release them?
[1:18:55] seekthepwn: she has to be some kind of doctor - that's why she took the HIPPOcratic oath :)
[1:19:05] DobbsjustDobbs: cohhStare
[1:19:05] tkcross21: all the gods playing poker ü§£
[1:19:08] jeffhunter12: bikeJudge
[1:19:16] Osskssa: Marc got shot at some Egyptian archeology site not neccassarily a temple
[1:19:17] Rawrsong: KAAAAANG!
[1:19:30] FrozanFlames: yeah Kang link feels more and more like a phase 4 need
[1:19:31] jawatbs: They did not showed up because they were scared of Godvid.
[1:19:32] nijntuu: would now love the gods in all their glory in a therapy session with stephen en marc
[1:19:35] ritchie313: i mean technically everything is kang
[1:19:52] Osskssa: Kaang is the new mephisto /faceslam
[1:20:08] Hundisilm: I counted 10 god stones
[1:20:18] Tremert: On the label at the door were it's the tomb that they didnt open it says MRMoon
[1:20:29] WayneG947: yeah let them go, Gorr needs victims
[1:20:31] KHupp13: What if the coffin he sees is the third personality they don't know about yet
[1:20:41] Legionnare92: it coudl be a "only way yo break konshu out is to break them all out"
[1:20:43] punchbowl: I hope steven fangirls over each god as he meets them
[1:20:44] FrozanFlames: Idk if Marc would but I bet STEVEN would let them out as Mr. Knight
[1:20:47] Sir_Myrmidon: haha Steven lets them out an Gorr shows up
[1:21:16] LeelandGrant: And then we cut to a scene after Gorr kills them all LUL
[1:21:18] Bellicosed: @KHupp13 seems plausible since the knife scene before when they both were like "what did you do? and they both went, wasn't me"
[1:21:19] Rawrsong: Magical Realism
[1:21:22] yrvengalied: true
[1:21:23] Osskssa: @KHupp13 oh it definately is, it was red and violent
[1:21:25] Bitghost_: ya but thor is an alien
[1:21:25] Altair900: A MAN IN THE OCEAN
[1:21:33] DyingEros: A MAN IS STILL IN THE OCEAN
[1:21:35] SpaceDive: they should get that ancient aliens guy on the show
[1:21:37] DobbsjustDobbs: A MAN IN THE OCEAN
[1:21:41] Sir_Myrmidon: it was what... 3? 4? Apocalypses ago?
[1:21:52] frozen_eggo: ya imagine if your dad dies thinking gods are real and Thor pops up veiOMEGALUL
[1:22:02] Legionnare92: do we know when this show takes place chronologically
[1:22:07] FrozanFlames: MCU is a bad place to be an atheist KEKW gods everywhere
[1:22:07] DD_The_Shmey: @Altair900 @DyingEros @DobbsjustDobbs . also the sky was all changed
[1:22:14] Hundisilm: I mean lets be fair - the MCU is ziptied together from multiple unrelated stuff :p
[1:22:25] DobbsjustDobbs: And a giant god head and hand popped up one time
[1:22:26] Malanor85: Ooooooo
[1:22:28] abagofpudding: they did say that they weren't using bushman
[1:22:28] DyingEros: The one that shot him
[1:22:36] Osskssa: geez tinfoil hat Bronze
[1:22:36] Public_Goat: Kang is Duchamp?
[1:22:37] DaRandalizer: so... theres a chance for the flying spaghetti monster coming to the MCU?
[1:22:40] VTuberThighsChokeVictim: They havent named the partner, so maybe!!
[1:22:42] Malanor85: Thats TOO good Bronze
[1:22:48] KingNightOwl: that would be a crazy twitch. I dont see it but maaaaybe
[1:22:50] reboot2099: nah, no chance kang is the partner
[1:22:52] FrozanFlames: Kang instead of Bushman would be bold as fuck LUL
[1:22:54] rich16bit: TheIlluminati
[1:23:08] Zethgryn: i think marc's partner is just the other alter ego
[1:23:18] jawatbs: Or he was used by the other gods who wish secrecy
[1:23:20] tkcross21: almost as crazy as a MAN in the OCEAN
[1:23:20] reboot2099: stop doing the mephisto thing with kang lol
[1:23:23] Altair900: Kang would have to be Rama-Tut or whatever
[1:23:25] Osskssa: @FrozanFlames Bushman was already in show he dead, Layla killed him at the rich guys place....was in credits
[1:23:28] Hundisilm: why would Kang care about that?
[1:23:32] LFC_Letters: or the guy who did it was working for Kang or something
[1:23:38] yrvengalied: ijpKEK
[1:23:39] Drakoni23: Guys! They are ALL skrulls! Clearly Kappa

[1:24:07] WDForty: so Jesse's confirmed that it's TOO GOOD of an idea so won't happen
[1:24:11] Osskssa: not in this it aint
[1:24:15] nijntuu: that would make kang just a joke
[1:24:32] FrozanFlames: Now the real question is does the revel go to the past like JP suggest or closer to modern times.
[1:24:34] Zrmi: I think Rama Tut was the reason the Egypt gods started betraying each other
[1:24:38] Altair900: if Kang shows up its going to be as a mention of Rama-Tut, not as Kang himself
[1:24:45] DyingEros: YOU KNOW NOTHING JESSE COX
[1:24:46] andaroo: getting to space nbd anymore

[1:24:53] 0GHammer: there is a GIANT MAN IN THE OCEAN KEKW
[1:24:56] Hundisilm: He deserves it Jesse - his previous girlfriend was arrowed to death
[1:24:56] Osskssa: Ok Moonknight will be in Thor, Konshu fixes Moljnir
[1:24:57] LFC_Letters: yeah it will be Rama-Tut, not Kang specifically
[1:25:02] Averagejoe007: KEKW
[1:25:05] WDForty: you can't expect things to tie up this soon, we're too early into the current mega arc
[1:25:06] Sir_Myrmidon: the ocean space man yeets jon snow into space _clearly_
[1:25:07] sandmanOW: kang is in the next ant man movie "Quantumania"
[1:25:08] Affly01: Did you ever imagine captain america going to space?
[1:25:10] WayneG947: Not a God
[1:25:10] EvoCaliber: LUL

[1:25:27] nullv: he needs S.W.O.R.D.
[1:25:29] Bellicosed: what if the godly war was about Apocalypse O_O and that is the main guy
[1:25:33] InternetPlumber: I really think they are soft removing it from the cannon
[1:25:36] OmarKhaledBadr: Blade has a spaceship guys, you don't get it LUL

[1:25:41] DyingEros: A GIANT MAN IN THE OCEAN
[1:25:43] Zrmi: Jon Snow is maybe in the nut house too... doesnt Black Knight die all the time?
[1:25:48] WayneG947: Vsmpires exist
[1:25:53] DD_The_Shmey: I think Kang is going to be an ancient Pharaoh Rama-Tut, who talked the gods into imprisoning eachother in stone... I think he had a hand in setting up the in the current state of things with the gods not interfearing in human's every day life
[1:25:59] xelan_star: and vampires too
[1:25:59] SpaceDive: eternals LUL lmao
[1:26:07] RoniBranco: A lot? only a Lot? there must be a better word for what they made
[1:26:20] FrozanFlames: and all this will lead to gods fighting dracula on the moon KEKW
[1:26:20] DyingEros: True KEKW
[1:26:21] Osskssa: @DD_The_Shmey for why? why would he care?
[1:26:27] DyingEros: I am 10000% here for it.

[1:27:09] darth_derpius: take us to batteworld
[1:27:11] HadieHim: i want to see gorr kill an entire pantheon of gods
[1:27:13] LeelandGrant: ragnarok was a good start
[1:27:15] DD_The_Shmey: @Osskssa the current state of afairs with gods non-interfearence makes it easier for Kang to establish a TVA agency (or something similar)
[1:27:17] RoniBranco: Cosmic Spider is coming
[1:27:18] Altair900: I just want to know how they introduce vampires
[1:27:18] ApathyOwl: planets do be tasty NODDERS

[1:27:53] SavageCheez: But he's the coolest dude ever
[1:27:56] ReginaldXIV: I'm from space bruh yoooo
[1:27:57] Rawrsong: Fishburne*
[1:27:59] WayneG947: they pretty much did that with Peter Quills dad, Ego
[1:28:00] DyingEros: I hope they cast Silver Surfer as someone absurd.
[1:28:00] Xanctius: Hugh Jackman clearly
[1:28:02] LeelandGrant: Crocdile Dundee?
[1:28:03] Hundisilm: You just cast the actual Silver Surfer
[1:28:03] Osskssa: @DD_The_Shmey the earthen gods are pretty weak in the bigger picture tho, especially whats out there
[1:28:08] Darkaros: silver bodyspray man
[1:28:09] ambidextrous_worm: nic cage please

[1:28:16] yrvengalied: Cody Rhodes the one who played Nero in DMC
[1:28:17] DyingEros: NIC CAGE

[1:28:24] MythGameStream: Nick Offerman voices Silver Surfer.
[1:28:24] PattyMacAttack: I mean if recent castings are anything to go by, if he's CG, he will be voiced by Chris Pratt
[1:28:36] DD_The_Shmey: @Osskssa Are they though??? the power level has not been established yet in MCU
[1:28:36] ambidextrous_worm: what if white vision becomes the silver surfer
[1:28:38] SeekoBlastar: Laura Bailey

[1:28:55] Zethgryn: keanu reevs KEKW
[1:28:55] spideycsa: point break silver surfer
[1:28:56] Masterpug13: Nick Cage
[1:28:57] ambidextrous_worm: like he noped out to space
[1:28:57] DyingEros: @itmeJP He's gonna run the gauntlet.
[1:29:02] WayneG947: Keanu is perfect
[1:29:02] SavageCheez: noooooooooo
[1:29:03] Zrmi: he doesnt act emotions so that would work LUL
[1:29:03] Osskssa: @DD_The_Shmey yes compared to a celestial lol
[1:29:04] andaroo: Just bring back Doug Jones again
[1:29:10] RoniBranco: James Earls Jones voice
[1:29:11] Seregrim: no way silver is buffed AF
[1:29:13] TheRhymenoceros: Keanu

[1:29:30] saiyanadam: Danny DeVito

[1:29:43] Masterpug13: C'mon, give Nick Cage a shot. Be soooo good. Hahaha
[1:29:44] Hundisilm: But... the usual caveat.. Tropic Thunder
[1:29:49] tkcross21: Kanye for silver surfer
[1:29:50] furry_wolf2001b: keanu got the face, and face acting for it
[1:29:51] SavageCheez: Ryan Gosling
[1:30:02] darth_derpius: timothee chalamet?
[1:30:13] LeelandGrant: make silver surfer a woman maybe?
[1:30:19] Gecko185: not true with with tom cruse, his role in tropic thunder, was not a typical tom cruse role.
[1:30:28] Omid18: oh yea for sure
[1:30:35] EndyBT: Silver surfer is clearly Elijah wood
[1:30:37] LFC_Letters: itll be done in 10 mins or so sadly
[1:30:37] Zrmi: he will have his powers back at end of episode is my guess
[1:30:39] spideycsa: the 3rd personality will show up
[1:30:43] DobbsjustDobbs: I think he's back alive by the halfway point
[1:30:44] Averagejoe007: I think we see the suit back at the end of 5
[1:30:53] WayneG947: @leelandgrant That is an excellent idea. Makes the character more symptethic around the story of her lose
[1:30:58] Malanor85: yes
[1:31:20] Osskssa: no
[1:31:25] reboot2099: episode 6 stinger is gonna be Gorr killing all the egyptian gods that are left (except for konshu)
[1:31:25] Altair900: Third tomb gets opened in episode 5 because Marc and Steven need to be whole in order to heal and come back to life
[1:31:25] Osskssa: not Konshu
[1:31:27] SchnellBier: how about schwarzenegger as silver surfer with terrible lines like in the batman movie
[1:31:33] hungoverhugo: Daniel Radcliffe silver surfer
[1:31:34] SavageCheez: Mark sets them free. Thats why Conchu allowed them to entomb him
[1:31:36] Sir_Myrmidon: maybe hippo lady knows Marc
[1:31:39] Zrmi: being there before doesnt mean he saw a freaking huge hippo before
[1:31:40] DD_The_Shmey: @Osskssa I think it has been established that the Celestials power level is on par with the gods - Didn't Gorr kill a celestial with his fancy sword, and Gorr also fights with gods... I dont think you can say hands down that celestials are on a significatly higher level than the gods. we just dont have enough information yet
[1:31:59] spideycsa: episode 6 is pure moon knight fighting
[1:32:01] Hundisilm: Anubist is stoned - can't id the other stones :p
[1:32:05] darth_derpius: @schnellbier he says "surfs up" before he launches someone into space
[1:32:06] LFC_Letters: I would love it if they left it but I think he comes back ep 5
[1:32:08] andaroo: @DD_The_Shmey I don't know if Gorr killed Knowhere, but the sword did
[1:32:09] ReginaldXIV: ijpHMM
[1:32:17] Zrmi: @DD_The_Shmey No it was someone else who wielded the sword
[1:32:21] Zethgryn: i hope we see anubis
[1:32:23] Osskssa: @DD_The_Shmey in the mcu we havent seen Gorr do anything yet, he is probably super depowered like Draxx
[1:32:25] DD_The_Shmey: oh
[1:32:29] Averagejoe007: between Moon Knight and Kang Kappa
[1:32:33] DD_The_Shmey: thats true @Osskssa
[1:32:40] Osskssa: the orderleys was the cops
[1:32:49] andaroo: @Osskssa from the trailer he does kill that mountain sized god
[1:32:53] DD_The_Shmey: we havent seen gorr yet
[1:32:54] Shin_gx: Shooting for the Moon Knight Kappa
[1:32:58] Malanor85: Im here for Wierd

[1:33:15] Averagejoe007: TV time ?
[1:33:20] Zrmi: @DD_The_Shmey Knull created the all black and killed Knowhere with it
[1:33:21] LFC_Letters: we probably get the flashback episodes of how he gets his powers and his parents and stuff
[1:33:22] Tyronin: she says we won again
[1:33:27] Tyronin: and ill share this time
[1:33:40] raptorscream: @itmeJP that BINGO thing is fake, numbers dont match letters
[1:33:49] Ravnim: she changes the noun everything, you, we, I won
[1:33:52] raptorscream: there's also a "74" that it's too high for BINGO
[1:33:57] kainin00: she said "you won", "we won", "i won"
[1:34:02] DD_The_Shmey: ok thanks @Zrmi , I'll have to google Knull
[1:34:03] JeXus1985: wasn't there an S followed by a number for bingo?
[1:34:05] JeXus1985: There's no S
[1:34:06] andaroo: Knull was a retcon btw, in 2018, but he was never named in the OG comic so easy to skip over it
[1:34:11] smashwow: which feels like irony based on the way mark treated here
[1:34:13] smashwow: her*
[1:34:19] reboot2099: the prize is being konshu's avatar and layla is gonna steal it from mark in episode 6 lol
[1:34:21] darth_derpius: they also said T-16 for bingo. star wars reference Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:34:28] BlueSapphyre: @DD_The_Shmey Knull is the symbiote god.

[2:19:02] OuroborosChemist: if 4k is not significant improvement over 1440p it jsut means your screen isnt big enough
[2:19:03] AinzN: Kaplin sending PJ DMs asking if his ass is ready! ijpSEXY
[2:19:06] bansheehero: I like the 43" inch 4K from Gigabyte for gaming, that is VA. For IPS LG and Dell  (LG) are great.

[2:21:36] Slittyfungus: ahh
[2:21:39] keathleyy: I'm hooked on the double 4k for work. But it just depends on everyone time spent on them probably.

[2:22:21] Joulupukin: Gigabyte 43" AORUS FV43U but its huge so if you want smaller not that one
[2:22:27] DaRandalizer: the 42 inch thingy to your right?
[2:22:27] Slittyfungus: that tv is so dope
[2:22:36] OuroborosChemist: @Scrapped i dunno one stealth bomber cost 2billion and whole program costs 200billion

[2:23:13] Lutcha81: just bought a c1 cus theyre a "cheap" now that C2 soon comes out
[2:23:17] bansheehero: they are big because 43" 4K is exactly 4x22" FullHD monitor. so great for porudctivity due to scaling.
[2:23:28] Slittyfungus: ^
[2:23:33] WDForty: i need a flat 16:9 or 16:10 QD-OLED monitor before i go in

[2:33:16] bansheehero: VA/TN are on their last leg, IPS has its place. OLED market will shake a bit in the summer
[2:33:16] WDForty: i built my current PC at the end of DDR3, and don't wanna do that again with buying into end of life tech
[2:33:16] BillZeBub13: can be useful to get something that's been out so you know all the issues that arise 6 months in

[2:33:34] Neragsito: that FF6 statue is not gonna buy itself lol

[2:33:37] DaRandalizer: buy it! or ask the wive first?

[2:33:45] El_Zilcho22: my monitor is over a decade old. ijpSAD
[2:33:49] scar3cr0w79: "since Jesus walked in sandals", as we say in Sweden
[2:33:51] WayneG947: I have had my PC for 11 years now and my main monitor is older again
[2:33:54] Knossos42: @WDForty You don't need to worry. DDR5 won't be good for years.
[2:33:58] WDForty: JP's a bleeding edge guy
[2:34:02] Gorn_Vernaleer: so? does the monitor still work? Is there anything you've noticed that is bad?
[2:34:04] SweCap: My gaming PC is 9 years... LUL
[2:34:05] MattiaV96: I have a 2k, 165hz gaming monitor which I bought with an offer at 300‚Ç¨, it's great but Nvidia Nvidia doesn't allow me to set my pc to 165hz, so I'm stuck at 144hz
[2:34:06] saundsr: half of chat was born since you bought your last gaming monitor
[2:34:07] Marc326: chat, tv is not a gaming monitor, it's a gaming tv ijpSMUG
[2:34:25] WDForty: @Knossos42 the problem is when DDR4 is phased out, replacing or upgrading gets stupid expensive
[2:34:39] WDForty: that's what happened to me and DDR3
[2:34:39] Kaleith: no u be soft PunOko

[2:35:13] 00oniking00: yep
[2:35:14] OuroborosChemist: karla or carla?
[2:35:14] bansheehero: @WDForty RAM is not changing much, but if you have money next gen will be the thing :) Q2 2023.

[2:36:55] Kaleith: probably users overall, including all the mobile games
[2:36:59] furry_wolf2001b: what shuld they expect, firing the people making the content, and not making new content
[2:37:00] phil9s: Nearly the population of the UK
[2:37:00] WDForty: @Knossos42 my current PC is over 8 years old, i build me PC to last me, and in the middle of that life span DDR3 prices skyrocketed
[2:37:06] Djhawk26: Still a WoW player
[2:37:14] UnboundSouls: just sounds like people who turn on blizzard app
[2:37:14] SweCap: Now imagine if Elon would feed those people with his twitter money LUL
[2:37:17] Kaleith: not really helpful not knowing what the numbers were and how the losses are distributed
[2:37:21] WayneG947: @gorn_vernaleer monthly users are all players across all IPs. I would likely count for 2 (WoW & OW)
[2:37:23] SgtStruthers: They will all be back for 10.0 and ow 2.0 Kappa
[2:37:24] moist_heinous: stalalaJAM
[2:37:27] Spheniscus: Most of the drop is from King
[2:37:44] yrvengalied: i didnt add that number as some reports say 50 mil some say 63 mil and other give random numbers
[2:37:47] UnboundSouls: half of them are probably Russion bots LUL
[2:37:49] moist_heinous: lol wait which monitor?
[2:38:05] WayneG947: there were a lot of negatives JP, i would just wait for the next releases
[2:38:05] Gorn_Vernaleer: ok if that is so, then wouldn't that number fluctuate all the time heavily? With new releases going up a lot and then going down again?
[2:38:08] afreak10: how much is it ?
[2:38:11] yrvengalied: they only said that they lost active users with no numbers and stated the reason
[2:38:12] Mugwart: Do we really need another screen?
[2:38:13] Wildskunk: might want to check Alienware AW3423DW QD-OLED first.
[2:38:13] ZeusLong52: that was an odd 3 second ad
[2:38:23] oPinger: might as well while the boss is away
[2:38:23] Puretaz: Look at the samsung g8 jp
[2:38:31] Knossos42: @WDForty 8 years is a long time for a pc to stay relevant
[2:38:34] bansheehero: I would go for 27 inch with 6 onitor setup.
[2:38:34] moist_heinous: as long as it's not ultra wide LUL
[2:38:41] UnboundSouls: do it cause problems when running monitors with 60hz and 144hz refresh rates?
[2:38:45] Mugwart: fuck it...yes we do
[2:38:48] lylphar: is it new that twitch shows both the stream and the ad?
[2:38:55] moist_heinous: ff14 doge mount?
[2:39:01] BarryCarlyon: @lylphar not really no.
[2:39:12] bansheehero: and the LG and Asus options are not bad IPS panels
[2:39:27] ProxyClouds: Big numbers but not a surprise I would say. CoD feel of the BattleRoyale throne and all Blizzard games have been bleeding players because of bad PR and games stagnating.
[2:39:33] Mugwart: Barry we always need new tch
[2:39:42] raptorscream: why new monitor if you have the big one?
[2:39:50] ChiZWorkshop: And how to fix it
[2:40:03] bansheehero: @raptorscream Not the same monitor in his layout.
[2:40:07] Kaleith: would playing at 120 hz work in that case?
[2:40:25] Seregrim: instead of buying twtter should of fixed BF2042
[2:40:26] Knossos42: @WDForty also updating memory doesn't help that much with gaming. GPU's are the single biggest indicator for gaming performance
[2:40:41] Knossos42: CPU next
[2:40:41] UnboundSouls: I think the biggest obstacle to 4k media is the lack ISP options
