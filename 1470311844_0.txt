[0:26:13] KidLee: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has already sold $42+ Million in Advanced Ticket Sales

[0:26:22] thanh_n2004: would we know if they were bad? do they publish numbers?
[0:26:23] bakavic: thats prob the first 45 minutes of the movie that they aqre spoiling
[0:26:23] Boshean: ijpW1
[0:26:25] ThemDemo: There is a twitter leaker 'noobmaster69' leaking a bunch of shit
[0:26:26] Norrak1: Ya I stopped watching the 30 sec. mini trailers it's just ridiculous at this point
[0:26:28] SgtStruthers: Put it on disney plus cowards
[0:26:28] KidLee: Early tracking has the opening weekend hitting a massive $150m, but many are expecting it to blow past that. For comparison Dr. Strange 1 opened at $85m
[0:26:31] Eristaios: please no spoiler ijpSAD
[0:26:31] 00oniking00: its crazy spoilers out there by marvel
[0:26:54] LokiCanadian: Sounds like we are better off going in completely blind for the experience.
[0:26:56] WDForty: i'm hoping everything they've shown is only first act
[0:27:02] A_Farmhand: i genuinely think its like what they did with endgame and its just the beginning
[0:27:05] Scottcher: The movie is probably only 30 minutes long
[0:27:06] Archangel3003: I've seen the first teaser they put out for it and then done my best to ignore anything else about it as I don't want spoilers at all.
[0:27:18] bakavic: the amc theater near me is all sold out, for opening weekend
[0:27:19] ThemDemo: That trailer apparently was supposed to come out next week
[0:27:19] thrillhouse451: Maybe we need a break from Marvel?
[0:27:23] DoctorJohn: coxJam
[0:27:28] Elektrifyz: I think they surpassed 47 million in presages which is insane
[0:27:32] Elektrifyz: Presales
[0:27:34] 8mmspikes: They are even promoting with vtubers
[0:27:35] Buffmages: !PoE
[0:27:36] Lihapiiras: It used to be that companies tried to restrict fans from spoiling the movie. Now its reversed.
[0:27:38] itmeBOT: Path of Exile's new league is hitting May 13, and JP will probably be playing a lot of it this season! He played last season completely offstream and enjoyed the new mapping endgame a lot even though the league and its mechanics weren't that appealing over Elden Ring.
[0:27:40] Archangel3003: Same with Thor, I've seen that teaser and that's enough for me.
[0:27:41] JBfromAccounting: @thrillhouse451 blasphemy!
[0:27:42] OuroborosChemist: movie isn't good if seeing 5mins of plots main plot points "spoils it"
[0:27:44] EightBitDelight: D+ at 30$ and I'll buy it. But going to a movie theatre in 2022? Not sold on that

[1:07:08] 1sttimelurker: he really shouldn't say anything

[1:07:15] Kaleith: nice%
[1:07:16] raptorscream: 69 mil
[1:07:24] T_W_O: no one allows bobby to do anything, he just does whatever he wants
[1:07:35] Azegoroth: If I was a shareholder in a company getting bought out by Microsoft I would want to cash in too
[1:07:59] Rawrsong: Oof
[1:08:01] Eristaios: demos?
[1:08:03] KingRahe: i will never understand the need to limit demos
[1:08:13] Sonatta: forced demos NODDERS
[1:08:15] Shoaron: mandatory demos?
[1:08:17] Rawrsong: "Try before you buy"
[1:08:25] CarrotWhisky: Not quite like demos; demos are developed seperately, whereas trials seems to be the full game, but with time.
[1:08:30] Kaleith: they have to marked the top tier ps plus in some way
[1:08:31] Omid18: they said devs don't need to make it. sony will create the demo
[1:08:32] Rawrsong: 2 hour access to the full game
[1:08:35] SgtStruthers: Are they free?
[1:08:40] CarrotWhisky: Similar to how Yakuza 7 had a trial instead of ad emo.
[1:08:41] Onefootstout: good stuff
[1:08:45] Mrshilka: PS forcing devs to make more content so they can upsell shit
[1:08:45] Sonatta: rather than develop a trial system into the Playstation store... they're forcing developers to make demos
[1:08:46] ArKiTroN: no the demos is to be created by playstation and not by the developer themselves
[1:08:50] mexican_computer: I always thought that cloud gaming would be used to demo games but that never happened.
[1:08:51] Kaleith: @SgtStruthers you have to sign up for the most expensive ps plus tier
[1:08:57] Eristaios: wtf?!
[1:09:03] hollysephiroth: Sounds great no ?
[1:09:04] CarrotWhisky: It's also not by the devs, but by Sony handling it.
[1:09:06] kainin00: so the end for refunds?
[1:09:10] Mrshilka: Move to xbox boys
[1:09:11] SgtStruthers: @SgtStruthers ohh i see. Gives that some value I guess

[1:09:28] Sonatta: Gamepass keeps looking better for developers LUL
[1:09:30] The_Shift_Key: EA does this, but it's their games.
[1:09:31] CarrotWhisky: Eh, not really. There were game trials even back in the PS3 era. I remember there for instance in Mafia II's trial.
[1:09:37] yrvengalied: basically wants to take money from the publishers and devs for nothing
[1:09:38] BiBaButzeBenne: what if the game isnt even 2 hours? like journey
[1:09:42] ItsBatsy: I mean steam and xbox you can just refund before 2 hours so its essentially the same thing
[1:09:44] ritchie313: man sony is like how do we make less money, boom got it make the devs mad @itmeJP
[1:09:47] Tronix_604: @itmejp  I'd like Ramis thoughts on this. Hmm
[1:09:48] SgtStruthers: People are going to stack their first hour with all the good gameplay
[1:09:52] Kaleith: @BiBaButzeBenne they usually aren't over 34$
[1:09:55] Woronov: BUT what did the npc say though i wanna know
[1:09:57] BiBaButzeBenne: ahh true
[1:10:08] Mrshilka: Sony saw Netflix thinking about ads and said hold my fucking Saki
[1:10:14] Sonatta: it needs to be successful but it can't include Sony titles
[1:10:29] LUMBOrak: but it said the Sony Team is doing the Timetrial versions
[1:10:35] TabascoCat27: The problem is Sony putting these behind premium subscription without compensating the dev
[1:10:48] ShingetsuMoon: oh yeah, people were saving up for YEARS lol
[1:10:50] Rawrsong: Shady Sony at it again
[1:10:52] Sir_Nerdly: The thing is I’m not even gonna play a 2hr trial for a game I’m on the fence for. But put the FULL game on your game pass equivalent and I’ll give it a shot.
[1:10:56] Sonatta: cracking down on people buying time cards to avoid they from benefiting from the free upgrade
[1:11:09] yrvengalied: we are back in the PS3 sony era
[1:11:14] Mrshilka: Sony being sneaky shits
[1:11:15] zacekmx: Time Trail, job is going to be done byu PSN Store.. The funtionality already exist, ex. Game with Free Weekends
[1:11:28] RoniBranco: LUL
[1:11:31] T_W_O: haha, they prorated their shit
[1:11:36] TwoRedWine: what??
[1:11:38] Stormmaggeddon: Lmao
[1:11:39] Vili_Borrson: zaqSquint
[1:11:41] ArKiTroN: the prepaid ps+ cards can be redeemed after the new ps+ launches in their region or when their current subscription ends
[1:11:44] DagooX: Hmm
[1:11:46] Sonatta: bait and switch at it's finest
[1:11:51] Monchenjiners23: Hmm
[1:11:53] JaxRebel: ijpSUFFER ijpSUFFER
[1:12:02] The_Shift_Key: Meanwhile Xbox let people convert all their gold to gamepass for $1
[1:12:07] the_ch0: CrungoSpin
[1:12:20] OuroborosChemist: makes sense you cant stack 10€ play time for 30€ worth after update that would be too generous
[1:12:20] thesestrangenotions: TTS breaks up too much for me, is there a url for this info?
[1:12:21] SolAlpha3: So dumb sony
[1:12:22] LUMBOrak: there are already people who have PSplus till 2032
[1:12:23] Sonatta: Have you heard about Gamepass...?
[1:12:25] Sir_Nerdly: It makes sense financially for them, I guess. You paid for your card at price x for the previous system
[1:12:33] WDForty: there's no bait and switch, if you paid for the lowest tier, they're not going to give you to full time for a higher tier for free
[1:12:36] DagooX: greyWeird
[1:12:42] NoorElBahrain: decemaber

[1:14:41] CarrotWhisky: This seems more about the Q&A-company itself rather than with BioWare.
[1:14:54] Mrshilka: its still ea signing the checks
[1:15:02] zerohour_88: KKona just get covid and fall over KKona
[1:15:12] Mrshilka: cheques
[1:15:25] Dredstryde: Flexible in house out sourced...

[1:16:50] dreddreplicant: NotLikeThis
[1:16:56] LUMBOrak: Sadge
[1:17:02] RhodesToRome: 343 weren;t prepared to develop for a live-service game
[1:17:04] Garrett_Redden: Glad the team is being prioritized but clearly something is happening poorly over there in management
[1:17:06] MakzinD: Man, that game was NOT ready for launch
[1:17:08] Mrshilka: good for work yeah but very poor planing for it to lose content
[1:17:11] Needleinahaystack: 343 is in shambles. Just give halo to another studio
[1:17:13] ThePointGaming: is it actually for health or just them prioritizing badly
[1:17:14] Gnomeleader213: I'm convinced there's 2 people who work in that studio and they just don't want to admit it
[1:17:17] UnboundSouls: Hmm
[1:17:24] CarrotWhisky: Shame that for around a decade, 343 still can't manage despite them trying with 4 games in the Halo-series.
[1:17:25] Mrshilka: exaclty it was rushed for release lacking content
[1:17:38] ThePointGaming: Exactly
[1:17:39] UnboundSouls: doesnt that just sound like they need to hire more people?
[1:17:39] Mrshilka: truth Jp
[1:17:40] dreddreplicant: yeah
[1:17:40] zerohour_88: at this point it just feels like they're guilt-tripping us

[1:17:44] Needleinahaystack: agreed
[1:17:44] yrvengalied: NODDERS *
[1:18:08] schwed15: but they also better be actually doing that and not just saying it
[1:18:11] MakzinD: This is the problem with contracting workers instead of hiring them
[1:18:17] dreddreplicant: 1 year delay too
[1:18:17] LUMBOrak: "release features"
[1:18:26] afreak10: NODDERS NODDERS
[1:18:26] SgtStruthers: They never even said anything about split screen co-op
[1:18:30] xarantur: We should've had co-op 3 months ago
[1:18:31] UnboundSouls: a year long beta Hmm
[1:18:31] El_Zilcho22: ijpNOPERS ijpNOPERS ijpNOPERS
[1:18:35] CarrotWhisky: @UnboundSouls The issues is that Microsoft has a weird, 18-months contractor policy, so they do "hire", but not in a sustainable way for a live-service game like Halo: Infinite.
[1:18:36] raptorscream: its on time
[1:18:37] LUMBOrak: i bet splitScreen is dead rooCry
[1:18:39] ShingetsuMoon: Live service games are really hard to keep going. Feels like they weren't ready for it
[1:18:41] zymioi: @itmeJP but they work so hard on that cook book that u wanted so much
[1:18:44] alonzogarbanzo: AI Clap
[1:18:44] Gertew: give the halo ip to someone else please
[1:18:46] SgtStruthers: They promised split screen after 5 didnt have it
[1:18:46] OuroborosChemist: its more like we wanna do x for workers but the budget is the same so things will be delayed
[1:18:50] AinzN: CARLA! hypeE

[3:24:09] iamjustacow: I have just one access and it's a covered hole with no ladder. I just ignore it...
[3:24:14] UnboundSouls: does having a bathroom attic door mess up the attic with all the humidity?
