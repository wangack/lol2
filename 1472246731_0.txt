[2:42:31] Mrshilka: ticketmaster was/is a great idea humans are just greedy shits

[2:43:50] raptorscream: @itmeJP i think so
[2:43:51] Gat0rCh0mp: It talks a lot about how public ticket releases have such a small allotment and how companies purchase up the tickets, like credit card companies for their incentives
[2:43:56] dwerzy: yeah
[2:43:57] Mrshilka: but yeah I am a 74 baby
[2:44:38] raptorscream: yeah, tickets released to the public is in low numbers, majority hold on for sale, hence scarecity and high prices
[2:44:46] Justice98405: Good luck in League today JP, I'm out. DFG was awesome.
[2:44:59] Boonia: ok i wasnt expecting that from a darius support
[2:45:05] Liminaly: did i just hear Jhin counting to 4 in the background?
[2:45:09] Archangel3003: I've just set up the notify me when in stock again email thing on the Lego site and saw them say on Twitter that they would be having more stock in so hoping to get one!
[2:45:28] Mrshilka: I saw both Sting and GNR in 1988 having to go get tickets at the venue
[2:45:35] UnboundSouls: having tinnitus since i was a kid is both a curse and blessing, i have zero desire to go out to any loud parties/venues

[2:45:59] Liminaly: i've heard him do it when you play as him, never as nother player. huh
[2:46:01] UnboundSouls: but thats also just a sound mixing problem
[2:46:11] UnboundSouls: movies and shows are just louder

[2:46:21] UnboundSouls: bunch of neat videos on that
[2:46:39] FrameLoss: @Mrshilka I can't remember the last time I bought a ticket at venue, but it had to be when CBGBS was still open.

[2:47:28] UnboundSouls: so does ticketmaster and stuff increase prices like certain airlines?
[2:47:35] Mrshilka: order tickets, order hotel, order taxi if needed all online

[2:56:00] pa_TIENce: Old VA I think
[2:56:24] pa_TIENce: Before he got reworked into Ice Troll King
[2:57:00] titanodin: how does yordle taste?
[2:57:11] Sinnethx: @itmeJP i heard from retiered pro player few days ago about Trundle ult stop do dmg when you lost vision on that target .. its loos like that was why Veigar dont die on mid few momets ago..
[2:57:25] Warhog__: !poe
[2:57:26] itmeBOT: Path of Exile's new league is hitting May 13, and JP will probably be playing a lot of it this season! He played last season completely offstream and enjoyed the new mapping endgame a lot even though the league and its mechanics weren't that appealing over Elden Ring.
[2:57:34] birkhoms: what are these protals on the walls?
[2:57:50] HeeroMaki: i am so bad at LOL now, i stopped playing in season 2 but loving playing kench top lol
[2:58:00] Mrshilka: @titanodin pretty good by the indepth art I have seen on online
[2:58:05] UnboundSouls: 2900 hours im finally able to make my own poe build stripSuffer
[2:58:11] Warhog__: It's the Hextech Dragon's "buff" @birkhoms
[2:58:18] Mrshilka: @UnboundSouls Pog
[2:58:20] titanodin: @Mrshilka WutFace
[2:58:21] Tylerjsmith97: ....and he ulted into the wall
[2:59:21] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:59:22] Tylerjsmith97: yeah JP he did it into Tribush wall
[2:59:34] birkhoms: @Warhog__ k, seems like lol changed quite a lot since I played last time, like 2013
[2:59:48] ProxyClouds: @itmejp don’t forget herald
[3:00:44] UnboundSouls: damn not bad
[3:00:57] birkhoms: and now they will complain that you did nothing LUL
[3:01:04] birkhoms: LOL in a nutshell
[3:01:16] Bojack_The_Horseman: sion BigBrother
[3:01:18] Archangel3003: Sion is so broken honestly lol
[3:01:29] Archangel3003: This guy playing him bad
[3:01:29] iamjustacow: is he building damage?
[3:01:48] pa_TIENce: Should have used his passive to kill inhib
[3:02:05] Archangel3003: We had a game lost as a Sion would take on 2 or 3 of us, kill one, die, then kill another 1 or 2 that were left low hp. If near a tower he's also take that too
[3:02:15] UnboundSouls: D:
[3:02:34] TDotTerror: First game?
[3:03:05] Archangel3003: Why did your Darius run into 3 of them with like a quarter hp lol?
[3:03:13] 14neo: how is that Sion 'silver'?
[3:03:24] Shoaron: do they have a silence?
[3:03:25] ratattad: you keep moving while its casting
[3:03:26] Doomwyte: fiddle silence maybe?
[3:03:26] ReginaldXIV: Jhin is way too complicated for someone who has no idea lol
[3:03:31] ProxyClouds: This sion is so bad
[3:03:47] afreak10: F
[3:03:56] UnboundSouls: LUL
[3:03:58] TDotTerror: Yup.
[3:04:04] Archangel3003: "Suck my dick Trundle" LUL
[3:04:09] thesestrangenotions: was DFG a short one?
[3:04:19] afreak10: verbal?
[3:04:26] titanodin: @itmeJP any bear games today?
[3:04:48] ceLaguna: Is Silver I below or above Silver II and so on in the ranking system? Don't know much about League
[3:04:56] newusertrue: !rank
[3:04:56] itmeBOT: As of April 29 2022, JP is Silver I in League of Legends (playing Jungle, switching from Top). This is his second season ever; JP started his League journey in October 2021 playing ADC. This is his all-time highest rank.
[3:05:07] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:05:15] ratattad: Silver 1 is above silver II
[3:05:48] ratattad: its about average skill level of players who participate in ranked play
[3:06:39] TDotTerror: LOL
[3:06:39] newusertrue: Silver is probably one of the hardest elks to get out of besides diamond
[3:06:45] TDotTerror: MeMe's got it rough.
[3:06:46] TheTonyStarkTV: Why do you like maining tundle?
[3:06:59] Brettakisse: cause hes the king
[3:07:55] anyhomies: woah a kled player
[3:08:17] 14neo: What's that Wolf char that is strong early but gets a bit weaker as the game goes on?
[3:08:20] TDotTerror: Voli looked good in unranked play.
[3:08:27] Brettakisse: warwick?
[3:08:29] issalga: possibly_issalga subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[3:08:29] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing possibly_issalga! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:08:35] anyhomies: i think a lot of people picked up gp after the buff
[3:09:28] Gat0rCh0mp: Clap
[3:09:28] Doomwyte: GP at this elo is like blitz, you can suck for 99% of the game, but land one good barrel/hook and its GG
[3:09:30] Brettakisse: good start
[3:09:30] Johnny2Cs: LUL
[3:09:30] woofser: EZ Clap
[3:09:31] zombo_com: anyways
[3:09:33] Buttzyy: what is he doing
[3:09:33] anyhomies: ddHuh
[3:09:34] shatteredsaint: what was that gp doing..
[3:09:41] Johnny2Cs: That was suicide
[3:09:54] HeeroMaki: cause he ya know, wanted to put you ahead...
[3:09:56] Killa_Ape: He's just proving the GP statement.
[3:10:07] TDotTerror: Gangplank got ganged up.
[3:10:43] ratattad: I would really recommend changing up your build this game, triforce against this team would again be much better. No tanks on opposing team
[3:11:07] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[3:11:26] Neragsito: and even more AS
[3:11:29] ratattad: its much better damage against squishies than divine sunderer
[3:11:33] Burkody: pepeRun
[3:13:55] MmmDoggy: classic yasuo
[3:14:14] aznhai: naaaah. levels are good on trundle.
[3:15:18] ratattad: Yep, and good dragon here. Both bot and mid had push
[3:16:23] Insigmada: does you haste area affect other people too?
[3:16:31] MmmDoggy: @Insigmada no
[3:17:24] Doomwyte: Kleds ult
[3:17:29] Radcosh: bless you
[3:17:37] Kaleith: "woohooo POGGIES "
[3:17:55] ratattad: Kleds ult gives you a massive speed buff, should have followed him there, but you got the flash anyway
[3:18:13] epicshoo: kled's gonna run it down now
[3:18:47] MmmDoggy: has to be someone elses mistakes who made me play bad!
[3:19:07] SilentCleric: good afternoon chat how goes it   ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3
[3:19:08] Insigmada: !poe
[3:19:08] itmeBOT: Path of Exile's new league is hitting May 13, and JP will probably be playing a lot of it this season! He played last season completely offstream and enjoyed the new mapping endgame a lot even though the league and its mechanics weren't that appealing over Elden Ring.
[3:20:01] ratattad: Bot invade on this side is very dangerous, your bot has to run so much further to help you out
[3:20:42] toaobadger: LUL the classic
[3:20:46] toaobadger: trundle kinda nuts rn tho
[3:21:08] toaobadger: wait the classic salty chat
[3:21:30] m3rcer: i died 1v1, its jg fault
[3:21:30] toaobadger: Solo dies  blames jungler
[3:21:47] NotYourLad: GP is super strong right now
[3:21:56] NotYourLad: super annoying to play against
[3:21:56] sin_plague: thanks for the gift sub @itmeJP
[3:22:16] 0utlawArts: its the whole; IF U WERE THERE mentality, which shudnt b ur state of mind wen playin top lane, or league in general in most cases
[3:23:00] m3rcer: what is that ward KEKW
[3:23:07] Karamor: didn't JP rage uninstall LoL?
[3:23:19] The_Faceless_Void: @Karamor That was PJ his brother
[3:23:39] Hwoaarangg: everyone rage installs it again eventually
[3:23:40] AinzN: Wait didn't JP have a Scion top or is this a different game? I had to step away for a bit but didn't think it was that long
[3:23:57] Rednexi5: Rednexi5 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[3:24:37] The_Faceless_Void: Kled bot tower is gone
[3:24:43] Insigmada: lol mid even pinged him on that one xD
[3:24:46] Baske_T: @AinzN diff game
[3:24:58] AinzN: Baske_T how did the other game go?
[3:25:10] sin_plague: your team is tilted and not thinking
[3:25:11] Baske_T: @AinzN JP's team FF'd
[3:25:13] The_Faceless_Void: @itmeJP Kled must of got placed in the group of kids who needs extra help from teachers and never g ot the help KEKW
[3:25:17] epicshoo: kled's mental in shambles before game even started
[3:25:19] Neragsito: they don't know lanes died like 5 min ago
[3:25:22] Karamor: the zen like music seems a nice way to stay calm
[3:25:26] AinzN: Baske_T oh ijpSAD
[3:25:28] StupendousHam: I also blame you
[3:25:30] Hewch007: sad part is they have 2 jungle wards and still died lol
[3:25:40] GrievAY: Omg JP support and mid are top! And u did nothing! And u turned off kled’s map and screen! Kappa DansGame
[3:25:43] pa_TIENce: Team can’t read minimap
[3:25:53] lordofchaos: ya the jungler live i love hate it cause it always the jungler fault lo
[3:25:59] sin_plague: kled is inting now
[3:26:16] NameThatIsAMeme: people should be bitching about getting ganked when they dont buy wards :/
[3:26:47] siledF: lmao get in there big dog
[3:26:49] siledF: what u scared of
[3:26:53] NameThatIsAMeme: souldn't*
[3:27:23] sin_plague: he's going to 1v4? with no support?
[3:27:41] epicshoo: definitely one of those games where lanes are just too far gone
[3:27:50] GibbyTheGamer: mod check
[3:28:25] sin_plague: at this point gp is one shotting people
[3:28:40] GrievAY: Klee has the mentality of an idiot. “Miza push lane, miza die, miza blame jungles, miza see jungler on mini map, miza still push”. Tbh that is an insult to idiots
[3:28:44] AinzN: What makes GP so powerful?
[3:28:59] sin_plague: crits
[3:29:00] shatteredsaint: being a fed pirate
[3:29:07] Jukettaja: Love the pillar into Yasuo ult
[3:29:42] oiluid: nice
[3:29:43] GrievAY: @ainzn  built in qss, global ult, hits like a truck the later it goes
[3:29:47] Karamor: @AinzN barrels, if he hits them his attack gets amplified, that damage ignores % of armor as an aoe, and he can chain the explosions.
[3:29:55] lStarkx: jhin solo pushing vs a fed le balnc KEKW
[3:30:01] AinzN: Thanks Chat! PepoG
[3:30:21] AinzN: Yummi just hanging out with Trundle the one decent player NODDERS
[3:30:27] sin_plague: maybe if you 5v5 and maybe if people pull their head out
[3:30:32] lStarkx: Gp is op due to lethality being so good with his kit
[3:30:38] Sinnethx: afk cat gamig :D
[3:30:56] ratattad: With a good yas/yuumi ult you can win
[3:31:35] NameThatIsAMeme: did jhin flash for the clone????
[3:31:42] Jukettaja: yes
[3:31:55] Karamor: @Civil____ and he didn't kill
[3:32:04] GrievAY: Now the q is, how will kled blame that on jp?
[3:32:05] epicshoo: "but it's jungle's fault" COPIUM
[3:32:11] AinzN: Kled? ijpWTF
[3:32:12] sin_plague: jhin literally ran forward to die
[3:32:27] AinzN: Oh that was Jhin who died
[3:32:46] ProxyClouds: Imagine if the Jhin could finish of the low enemies. He just keeps dying early in the fight
[3:33:22] GrievAY: Shouldn’t Yumi be with Yasuo?
[3:33:26] sin_plague: well, right now lb has nothing to fear. no one has enough mr to fend her off.
[3:33:29] ratattad: Problem at this elo is that pretty much every gank is gonna succeed with minimal setup, and every time you were in position to gank the lanes were pushing
[3:33:47] epicshoo: kled with his one brain cell that ults any visible enemy
[3:34:16] AinzN: So Chat with the way Yuumi is playing jsut staying attached to JP who is meant to buy and place the wards?
[3:34:18] epicshoo: ijpSUFFER
[3:34:33] siledF: RIP
[3:34:40] sin_plague: let's see the drama
[3:34:52] Snowplex: cirNom
[3:34:57] epicshoo: yikes
[3:35:01] Karamor: @AinzN yuumi gets free wards and can palce them while attached
[3:35:02] ceLaguna: pvpBag
[3:35:05] woofser: oof
[3:35:23] sin_plague: too tilted to talk shit
[3:35:28] sin_plague: impressive
[3:35:33] Sharodin: 3:10 Yassuo just hit his powerspike^^
[3:35:40] AinzN: Karamor interesting
[3:35:43] AnnieJella: Naah
[3:35:45] sin_plague: no
[3:35:58] AnnieJella: Does gp Oranges cancel the hook or nah?
[3:35:58] The_Faceless_Void: barrels are OP
[3:35:58] GrievAY: No range vs melee
[3:35:59] Dagomani: Is GP still incredibly busted to the point where if the player is decent he just stomps top lane in general? :P
[3:36:03] halebob: halebob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:36:03] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing halebob! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[3:36:04] ratattad: Its a pretty bad matchup since gp can just cleanse the chains
[3:36:08] Rednexi5: can you check kleds stats?
[3:36:25] Karamor: @AinzN to be clear, free ards from the support item, but in general everyone should ward with free trinket wards or clear
[3:36:26] siledF: kled actualls wins
[3:36:31] sin_plague: gp just tenderizes kled with barrels like a nice steak
[3:36:34] siledF: tough matchup for GP
[3:36:37] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[3:36:49] epicshoo: monkaS
[3:36:57] AnnieJella: monkaS
[3:36:58] Rednexi5: @itmeJP Any plans for some Voli?
[3:37:00] ratattad: You might be right, kled does win most melee setups. didnt look up the stats
[3:37:02] GrievAY: The thing is Kled try to win and push the lane, instead of soaking xp getting the gold he can and play for when landing is over
[3:37:06] NameThatIsAMeme: Counters and matchups dont matter under plat in my mind.
[3:37:10] Mud__: zekeS
[3:37:10] sin_plague: you are incorrect @siledF
[3:37:20] AnnieJella: Well he is watching the stream
[3:37:24] AnnieJella: so 100% streamsniper
[3:37:40] siledF: @sin_plague nah big dog. check u gg. kled is GPs 4th toughest matchup
[3:37:41] epicshoo: voli looked fun
[3:37:55] siledF: but that dont mean skill doesnt come into play,l ike anything else
[3:38:00] ceLaguna: Graves is supposedly the ez gg lp no re Jungler
[3:38:02] siledF: jungler influence, ect
[3:38:11] Boonia: Jp do you think voice chat would improve or hurt rank in league
[3:38:21] azriel2k3: hurt big time
[3:38:23] AinzN: Hurt
[3:38:24] Archangel3003: Sejuani <3
[3:38:27] epicshoo: nothing will improve league KEKLEO
[3:38:27] NameThatIsAMeme: Hurt
[3:38:32] scooterjr37: dont play karthus the ap junglers are ass atm,
[3:38:33] lStarkx: they should removte chat tb
[3:38:37] Archangel3003: Love playing her jgl currently
[3:38:38] ReginaldXIV: Voice chat does nothing for Dota 2
[3:38:39] lStarkx: just leave pings
[3:38:41] Karamor: they had voice chat and no one every used it
[3:38:46] lStarkx: so people dont type shit
[3:39:00] siledF: @lStarkx you can disable it. i highly advise it. completely different game
[3:39:03] Xenflux: unless you're playing CoD on Xbox Live in 2006
[3:39:06] KTGoggins: But voice chat did wonders in Heroes
[3:39:09] lStarkx: i mean if people can type
[3:39:11] lStarkx: its worse
[3:39:13] lStarkx: waste of time
[3:39:16] ryu_furinkazan: Cowards are brave online
[3:39:17] lStarkx: people dont listen anyways
[3:39:32] Archangel3003: Voice chat might make this game like CoD lobbies
[3:39:33] Denimco: Is there a command to block text but keep the pings?
[3:39:35] siledF: turn off allied chat, all chat and enemy emotes. HolidaySanta
[3:39:41] HSRpepe: I just never type in chat
[3:39:48] siledF: @Denimco yeah in interface
[3:39:50] AinzN: PauseChamp
[3:39:59] KTGoggins: @Denimco Yeah you can individually mute the chat or the pings, leaving whatever you want open
[3:39:59] Mud__: UHMM
[3:40:11] The_Faceless_Void: I tilt at people who NEVER USE PINGS
[3:40:21] Karamor: @Denimco yes, you only block chat, emotes or pings respectively
[3:40:26] The_Faceless_Void: Like why? you dont have to talk and pings give me a better idea of what you want to do
[3:40:26] AinzN: No crash! hypeE
[3:40:28] Killa_Ape: I missed the end of the last game, did it end poorly?
[3:40:33] sin_plague: yes
[3:40:35] AinzN: Killa_Ape yeah
[3:40:35] The_Faceless_Void: very poorly
[3:40:37] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[3:40:50] Mrshilka: racism would go up
[3:40:56] sin_plague: ^
[3:40:58] The_Faceless_Void: squakers go up KEKW
[3:41:06] The_Faceless_Void: sqeakers*
[3:41:14] siledF: games dead anyway who cares
[3:41:23] AnnieJella: The misogony will go up Sadge
[3:41:26] Almacare: That billy is always doing this
[3:41:27] The_Faceless_Void: ? @siledF what
[3:41:27] Rednexi5: The amount of people that have sex with my mom allegedly would skyrocket
[3:41:27] AinzN: ijpWTF
[3:41:30] Denimco: @KTGoggins I know it can be done individually. But to do this every game is a bit to much. Would be nice to have a command
[3:41:39] Mrshilka: or he is a conservative and does not care
[3:41:43] AinzN: Rednexi5 your mum does have it going on NODDERS
[3:41:45] The_Faceless_Void: Also riot made valorant and its just as good if not better to some
[3:42:08] azriel2k3: Every now and then I get the urge to pick this back up again but then I remember how mad it used to make me
[3:42:13] Rednexi5: @AinzN She "was" a lovely lady
[3:42:27] Mrshilka: I have an adult step sona nd not even I have used well I fucked your mum comment
[3:42:37] itmeBOT:  We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info:  https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[3:42:41] sin_plague: once I deleted I never came back. totally worth it.
[3:42:44] KTGoggins: @Denimco Yes well unfortunately there's no cool answer there. However, the upside is all you have to do is open the scoreboard and click a button
[3:42:46] AinzN: I am a long time Dota 2 player/watcher but I have been watching more League lately. Dota just seems boring to me now
[3:43:08] Mrshilka: Dota heros feel rather more tame than lol
[3:43:10] KTGoggins: @Denimco It's a pain to do every game, yes. But at least it's a minor pain? :p
[3:43:19] Karamor: @Mrshilka they are not
[3:43:33] siledF: @KTGoggins there is an option in the interface settings to disable the chats so you dont gotta do it every game
[3:43:41] Mrshilka: but most importantly lol porn is far superior to dota porn NODDERS
[3:43:43] EzI091: @Mrshilka more tame? in what sense? they are more complex than lol
[3:43:45] ratattad: still very worth, kills on morgana is fine
[3:43:51] Warped_Oblivion: kass getting it is worth
[3:43:52] Kaleith: morg died first
[3:43:53] Brettakisse: kassadin is a solid champ to get kills for
[3:43:54] Gat0rCh0mp: no cause you died 2nd so they would go to her, but she is dead
[3:43:56] Denimco: @KTGoggins Absolutely, considering you get a lot of peace when turning the chat off XD
[3:44:03] KTGoggins: @siledF orly? And does it stop at chat or does it mute the pings too?
[3:44:06] siledF: @Denimco get into a game, go to settings, interface and scroll down. two boxes to disable [Allied] Chat and All chat
[3:44:10] AinzN: I like the simplicity of League at the moment. There is too much going on in Dota for my lizard brain to keep up with
[3:44:13] siledF: @KTGoggins no it doesnt mute pings, just chat
[3:44:20] Kaleith: still good to get 1st blood and her flash for sure
[3:44:26] siledF: then if you want to mute pings you have to do that individually in the game
[3:44:35] Kaleith: Clap
[3:44:37] AinzN: ijpEZ Clap
[3:44:41] sin_plague: brainless panth
[3:44:45] KTGoggins: Ah that's right you can just turn the chat off, true. I've had All Chat off forever and forgot at this point @siledF BloodTrail
[3:44:45] Mrshilka: @AinzN likely this for me since i only watch lol here
[3:44:52] siledF: @Denimco @KTGoggins a real game changer!
[3:44:58] Denimco: Ohw nice @siledF Thank you!
[3:45:12] siledF: but you have to be in a game to see the settings. not from the client
[3:45:17] AinzN: Mrshilka yeah I only watch League here as well. I might check out Crendor doing ARAM but most of the time that's too late for me

[3:54:44] sin_plague: in. shambles.
[3:54:45] Fateborn: Yep, Vlad is just dumb
[3:54:47] ratattad: To be fair, if you just had overloaded bot you could have salvaged that. Try and work with what you get, no reason that you have to stay top there
[3:55:38] murasaur: no idea why morgana was so deep
[3:55:50] murasaur: or whatever that character is, cant tell the skin

[4:01:01] Kabora: Impressive for potatoes, soon they'll take over the world!
[4:01:09] TDotTerror: The higher you go, the potato-y your teammates will be.
[4:01:18] GrievAY: The logic is, see player kill player/die to player

[4:02:32] aLeafGuy: best bet would be to take teemos jungle
[4:02:48] siledF: get up in his ass
[4:02:49] ZeroDjinn: yeah teemo jungle is a thing
[4:02:52] titanodin: trool
[4:02:52] KTGoggins: Yeah, that's normal
[4:02:53] HSRpepe: I think you win that 1v1
[4:02:56] maaadmarty: Teemo can jungle but I wouldn't say it is great
[4:03:03] zombo_com: it is silver
[4:03:04] ZeroDjinn: not fast early on
[4:03:05] siledF: just dont let him blind ur q
[4:03:09] GrievAY: Haha teemo jungle, will he do the ye old hide at second buff steal I wonder
[4:03:12] titanodin: i seen more morgs jungle than teemo
[4:03:14] Gat0rCh0mp: theres gonna be shrooms everywhere, itll get annoying if he gets going
[4:03:23] ZeroDjinn: sweeper early for sure
[4:03:31] Fynagle: Down in iron/bronze there's been an infestation of OTPs/off-meta players who just pick dumb stuff.
[4:03:36] Kabora: Don't know much about LoL, but I've heard Teemo is annoying.
[4:03:40] HSRpepe: just invade his ass early
[4:03:46] Wolfesong_: prolly starts blue cause he's topside, but Red benefits teemo more since it's on hit.
[4:04:07] Mud__: I never played league, I just like to watch...like a league of legends voyeur PauseChamp
[4:04:08] crux_58: ijpHMM
[4:04:11] HSRpepe: jp gonna carry this game
[4:04:15] ZeroDjinn: @Kabora teemo was basically the original ranged top who also put down mines to stop ganks. He is out done by many new champs but the irritation is still there
[4:04:17] siledF: Kappa
[4:04:30] ZeroDjinn: most tops were melee back then
[4:06:38] ashton895: i play pantheon any tips for him ?
[4:06:57] The_Faceless_Void: stun
[4:06:59] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW
[4:07:07] Fynagle: Huh, is that how scuttle works? A single skillshot ability/spell breaks the whole shield?
[4:07:19] siledF: cc ability
[4:07:21] The_Faceless_Void: stun or knockup for scuttle
[4:07:49] KTGoggins: @Fynagle As long as the ability causes any kind of CC. The pillar is a knock up if you hit it dead center
[4:07:58] KTGoggins: Pardon me, Hard CC. Slows don't do it
[4:08:08] Radcosh: good night and good luck JP and chat. enjoy the game
[4:08:08] Fynagle: @The_Faceless_Void Do roots work or does it have to be a hard stun?
[4:08:17] AinzN: Radcosh peepoBye
[4:09:11] Rawrsong: Mid Riven ain't used much for a reason
[4:09:27] KTGoggins: @ashton895 When playing Pantheon, remember that you get half your cooldown back on your Q if you just tap it, rather than throwing it
[4:09:32] sin_plague: anything that stops movement iirc
[4:09:36] Agspi: @itmeJP Have you watched any professional League games?
[4:09:45] thrillhouse451: JP Mods Chat ijpHI ijpDEAL
[4:09:56] thrillhouse451: Fun DF today
[4:10:04] KTGoggins: @ashton895 harassing with throwing your Q seems like a good idea, but it's a wicked 13 seconds cooldown early on, and you get the same damage by just stabbing it forward
[4:10:15] Karamor: riven in one shot hp range
[4:11:02] garry_leonard: ki.ll his sent ward?

[4:15:02] Ryuenjin: Honestly it looked like he was going to run away until Mundo showed up. I figured he was going to let you die.
[4:15:11] Rawrsong: Kid saw a few Riven highlight vids and thinks he can just pop off anywhere anyyime
