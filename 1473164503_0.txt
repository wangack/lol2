[0:47:12] Drakoni23: That explains how he has such good chemistry with himself, because he has great chemistry with his brother

[0:48:46] Drakoni23: It's like watching a magic trick, where you know it is but you don't care and believe it anways cause it's done SO well
[0:48:55] Omid18: disagreed. episode 3 was the worst episode of the series
[0:49:06] ThemDemo: I think this episode hits as hard as it does because of eps 1 and 2
[0:49:07] zerohour_88: I expected some sort of trauma, but damn episode 5 went off
[0:49:19] GrannySith: eww normies
[0:49:24] GrannySith: Kappa
[0:49:33] AnyOtherSunday: The director of ep4 and the first 3 is the same and the vibe was totally different
[0:49:34] PariahPaladin: After episode 4 I was sad that there are only 6 episodes.  I want another 10.
[0:49:38] Bitghost_: people didn't even know why he went to that tomb...which is the entire point of the show lmao
[0:49:38] Norrak1: Ya my wife isn't really getting into it, she was more into Loki and that was weird too
[0:49:42] the_ch0: NODDERS Dark AF
[0:49:43] jeffhunter12: real fucked up
[0:49:45] AnyOtherSunday: this episode and the finale will be by different directors
[0:49:46] EvilBuho: I think is the same reason people did not like Legion in FX, it was too weird for regular MCU fans. Bunch of dumb dumbs
[0:49:46] wujuice: hes such a good actor
[0:49:50] Ravnim: dark and too real

[0:50:20] Norrak1: I was hoping he killed her
[0:50:21] jeffhunter12: was horrifying
[0:50:34] Zrmi: The thing that making me dislike Moon Knight the most is 'the hero' not being likeable. I just don't like Steven/Mark enough to care about it.
[0:50:34] Rivix86: But her story was written so true to life, so well done
[0:50:39] zerohour_88: even Bronze describing the scene is giving me nam flashback
[0:50:40] Frost0555: @norrak1 WutFace
[0:50:48] normalnaut: And Dad's negligence
[0:50:49] Loksen: D&D time for me. Will check the vod or youtube afterwards
[0:50:49] b0ksah: @Mediocritish not disney
[0:50:50] crzymike: for her to blame him for everything. it was sad
[0:50:50] iiidaaah: yeah, jessica jones for sure had really dark stuff too. but that was netflix
[0:50:56] Norrak1: @Frost0555 I meant, his 3rd personality
[0:51:00] jeffhunter12: it reminds me of when falcon actually adressed racism, i didnt expect theyd actually dare
[0:51:08] the_ch0: Him crying in the street after her death really got me
[0:51:08] Frost0555: @norrak1 ohhh lol
[0:51:21] GrannySith: Thanos was just a jolly purple dude who did something so hugely abstract that it's hard to process.
[0:51:21] fihritoo: Moon knight is the first marvel IP my kids stopped watching
[0:51:23] jeffhunter12: @the_ch0 yeah that hit hard
[0:51:27] rich16bit: it was tough but totally needed to explain Marks extreme issues
[0:51:29] Osskssa: @AnyOtherSunday same guy directed 1, 3, 5 and 6
[0:51:31] Kyriac: it triggered me quite bad because of my childhood not gonna lie
[0:51:31] oaktree3: so thats why disney plus required me to verify my age before watching moonknight
[0:51:40] bloodowl77: Nimo?
[0:51:45] 23Thijs: Nemo?
[0:52:00] Iko336: Finding nemo just got dark

[0:52:45] Norrak1: But is he?
[0:52:51] Norrak1: I mean he still gave him a choice
[0:52:56] DD_The_Shmey: ijpNODDERS
[0:53:06] Ravnim: konshu say steven is a worm, but he's a goat
[0:53:08] Osskssa: thats a choice
[0:53:12] ThemDemo: I love how Steven also forgave himself about his brother's death too
[0:53:16] Norrak1: And he didn't seek him out, Marc found Konshu by accident really
[0:53:39] DD_The_Shmey: or did he @Norrak1 ??
[0:53:39] shadowoflight_: that broke me
[0:53:52] Norrak1: Heck if you ask me Konshu made someone better out of Marc, he was pretty bad
[0:53:57] jeffhunter12: im pretty sure the ''therapist'' part is his subconcious trying to fix his shit and help finally move forward
[0:53:59] Norrak1: At least he had a purpose now
[0:54:10] Legionnare92: i dont get how its a trauma response personality but also egyptian god realms treats them as separate souls?
[0:54:17] rich16bit: ijpNODDERS
[0:54:27] LFC_Letters: How long have we been talking about ep 5 chat?
[0:54:37] Heisuisui: 10 min?
[0:54:46] shadowoflight_: @Legionnare92 same soul, but not whole, from my understanding
[0:54:56] shadowoflight_: broken up
[0:55:02] Norrak1: Ya I think that was a blunder
[0:55:04] Siggenlh: Konshu really broke his brain proper is what i see @Legionnare92
[0:55:10] 00oniking00: mark create steven for the abuse but steven dont remember the abuse
[0:55:11] jeffhunter12: stevens personality is also fucked and tried to block it out
[0:55:11] 4MrAnderson: Jack took the beating, not mark or steven
[0:55:18] Talosar7: Mark created Steven, Steven created Jake for the beating part
[0:55:19] rich16bit: i think Jake took the abuse
[0:55:20] DD_The_Shmey: nope nope, The theory is that Jake is the one who took the beating
[0:55:25] Aurugorn: Jake :)
[0:55:27] Xanctius: Jack has been there
[0:55:29] Xanctius: er jake
[0:55:29] lazyxzone: a third personality? the red sarcophagus in the ward?
[0:55:36] Siggenlh: its sorta the same way the hulk when astral planed is 2 difrent "souls"
[0:55:39] Olf_Himself: Jake was in the episode
[0:55:41] Legionnare92: @shadowoflight_ but then how would steven being lost in the sand end up balancing the scale?

[0:55:48] 00oniking00: true
[0:55:49] Klarion21: I had the same thought as Jesse, why would steven be created to shield him but then steven gets beat
[0:55:50] ThemDemo: In the scene where he has a broken nose with Harrow
[0:55:51] rich16bit: yep
[0:55:51] Siggenlh: we saw Lockley.

[0:55:57] Munetani_NJimha: When he has the bandaid on the nose
[0:55:58] DD_The_Shmey: Steven is in denial, Jake took the beating, and Mark is the original
[0:55:58] Masterpug13: "Mom is angry because I didn't clean my room." instead of "Mom is angry because she thinks I was responsible for my brother's death."
[0:55:59] Deadpixzl: Yep, Jake is the one with the broken nose
[0:55:59] AthulNL: KEKW

[0:56:01] ilsombrero: I thought the director denied that?
[0:56:04] Siggenlh: his nose was also cut up
[0:56:11] Gorn_Vernaleer: how can the scale be level with 3 in him?
[0:56:13] WayneG947: Yeah he did have teh brooklyn accent
[0:56:16] RVIII: @ilsombrero he did, but I assumed he was a big lying liar
[0:56:17] Zrmi: But why is the scale balanced when Jake still there?
[0:56:32] ilsombrero: @RVIII that´s absolutely possible xD
[0:56:33] DD_The_Shmey: ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS
[0:56:34] demo_nacho: The theory in the fandom is that Jake was created to take his mom's beatings
[0:56:34] AnyOtherSunday: why only 2 hearts then?
[0:56:42] Redvelvet84: cause you go from 3 to 2
[0:56:42] LFC_Letters: @Gorn_Vernaleer because Jake is trapped and Steven is dead... so its just Marc
[0:56:44] shadowoflight_: @shadowoflight_ I felt that was kinda like... without steven, the soul was not longer split,
[0:56:51] Siggenlh: @Zrmi maybe its unbalanced if jake show up proper WutFace
[0:56:52] Doctor_Von_Decency: bronze is 5head I just got chills lol
[0:56:57] iiidaaah: The director did not deny. He just answered "no" too "please confirm this is jake".
[0:56:57] Stormmaggeddon: how the fuck are they going to tie this up with 1 episode
[0:57:05] ReginaldXIV: Hello I'm Erik Voss an welcome to my top 20 easter eggs of Moon Knight Episode 5!
[0:57:13] Legionnare92: also how can the scales balance when we have this 3rd personality?
[0:57:26] CorporalPibb: Steven created Jake
[0:57:27] 00oniking00: steven dont remember the beating
[0:57:28] shadowoflight_: @Legionnare92 no idea lol
[0:57:33] Gorn_Vernaleer: @LFC_Letters if Jake is trapped, how can he still come out to kill people? that does not make sense
[0:57:35] jeffhunter12: @Legionnare92 yeah i dont get that either
[0:57:44] jeffhunter12: there are some big questions
[0:57:50] zerohour_88: the scales being balanced with the 2 hearts can make sense, cause its just the 2 hearts being on that scale
[0:57:52] Redvelvet84: @Legionnare92 cause steven freezes, and therers only 2 left, so balance
[0:57:59] jeffhunter12: like why did steven not talk about how anubis should have been there
[0:58:06] Siggenlh: Jake is only trapped in the "ward". he out and about in the scenes we dont see either of teh other 2
[0:58:16] muffinface__: @itmeJP they tease that when he says on the boat "its in me too" and starts to fight the sand dudes.
[0:58:28] Docgalaad: it's weird the balance reached equilibrium without the need for jake to be onscreen
[0:58:29] Legionnare92: @Redvelvet84 they only ever show two on the scale, steven and marc's tho
[0:58:47] DyingEros: @Docgalaad Its because they were missing a heart
[0:58:59] Siggenlh: im sad they gonna shove in the entire Jacke bit and the endfight in one episode
[0:59:04] Siggenlh: Jake
[0:59:05] Drakoni23: Really recommend braiDIDbunch on Youtube. They made some videos talking about the episodes, their own experience with DID, how accurate/relatable it is.
[0:59:08] Broxalar: Also there was another sarcophagus that didn’t get opened during the episode
[0:59:11] jeffhunter12: both personalities got major issues
[0:59:13] DyingEros: BINGO BRONZE
[0:59:16] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[0:59:19] Cephyric: 6 is the finale though, so they've gotta introduce jake and get marc and stephen back and beat harrow and get konshu and stop ahmut? That's a lot to do in 40 minutes...
[0:59:38] BuggleStrus: Do we know episode 6 runtime?
[0:59:42] Lord_Beardmeister: I feel Jake is a season 2 reveal. Easter eggs in S1, but nothing formal
[0:59:50] TheAetherParadox: That happened when both of them didnt talk to layla about the crazy violence and missing time
[0:59:52] jeffhunter12: i love how they let that sink in with the dial tone
[1:00:06] the_ch0: PepeLaugh
[1:00:09] zerohour_88: ijpKEK
[1:00:12] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[1:00:13] crypticnightwing21: Oscar Isaac said we would find out who was in the red sarcophagus in episode 6 @itmeJP
[1:00:42] raptorscream: Steve seemed scared and confused in teh 1st episode
[1:00:53] WaystedMined: Is the 3rd personality the person who killed the wife's father?
[1:00:54] Redvelvet84: @Legionnare92 i think thats just 1 heart "copied" cause its still 1 person, so the hearts just reflect 3 personalities.
[1:01:09] Redvelvet84: *2
[1:01:10] Sir_Myrmidon: Jake probably arranged the date in Ep1 also
[1:01:15] jeffhunter12: @Sir_Myrmidon he did yeah
[1:01:20] LessSanity: @WaystedMined no, they say who did it in the episode
[1:01:25] Omid18: he says just tie him up though
[1:01:29] raptorscream: Mark also mercenary
[1:01:37] ApathyOwl: Hmm
[1:01:42] Kev_Bo23: they never let jake out of the coffin at that point right?
[1:01:44] LFC_Letters: Jake would be a different person since they have there seperate bodies now
[1:01:45] Drakoni23: Wouldn't they be separate in that world?
[1:01:48] shadowoflight_: I think jake just does it, marc still thinks about it
[1:01:52] DobbsjustDobbs: That's too much, there'd be a separate body for the third one
[1:01:55] Zrmi: After credits probably be like... but hey there is one more
[1:02:00] raptorscream: @itmeJP wouldnt Jake be a 3rd body, sicne each personality ahs a body
[1:02:01] MysticXIII_: MysticXIII_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 12 month streak! 
[1:02:01] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing MysticXIII_! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[1:02:07] Bitghost_: 7 ads wtf
[1:02:10] Josanni: @itmeJP I think Jake was the drunk version outside the funeral too
[1:02:22] ThemDemo: That bird skeleton before the cave is interesting ijpHmm
[1:02:26] Crafteroon: A great Hollywood moment was when Elizabeth Taylor was introduced as "Queen of De Nile" after making Cleopatra.
[1:02:36] Xanctius: The place the bandaid is on jakes nose is the same place Konshu has a bump on his
[1:02:39] Osskssa: seperate bodies? there is only one body lol
[1:02:52] jeffhunter12: oh neat
[1:03:05] raptorscream: @Osskssa in the assylum, they're shown as being a single entity
[1:03:20] Drakoni23: Isn't the fish drawing in the background even somewhere? Or am I making that up?
[1:03:33] xelan_star: harrow taking the buss to work
[1:03:47] Xanctius: She refers to him being stuck in then desert
[1:03:51] normalnaut: @Drakoni23 the fish drawing was hanging on the wall in the bedroom when mom comes in
[1:04:01] DyingEros: I agree. It was the best episode hands down. I really hope they keep up the mature theme
[1:04:01] zerohour_88: they need to lock Oscar Isaac down
[1:04:06] Aythers: Loki had better episodes than this IMO
[1:04:07] LFC_Letters: im ready Jesse
[1:04:08] Brandling: PopCorn
[1:04:11] Osskssa: @WaystedMined no Bushman did that and shot Marc
[1:04:11] DyingEros: @zerohour_88 1000%
[1:04:51] Cephyric: They do this with trailers all the time though
[1:05:29] Eristaios: will we see jake side of the black-out moments ?
[1:05:54] raptorscream: Loki
[1:05:57] Norrak1: Loki
[1:05:57] SpaceW_: Loki
[1:05:58] zerohour_88: @Eristaios we'll need like 2 more episodes
[1:05:58] the_ch0: Loki
[1:05:58] ThemDemo: The twitter post was updated as well to replace Series to Season
[1:05:59] BlueSapphyre: loki.
[1:06:00] CorporalPibb: Loki
[1:06:01] spideycsa: is the next episode gonna be an 1 hour 20 minutes?
[1:06:04] RVIII: Loki
[1:06:06] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: Loki
[1:06:06] PariahPaladin: Yeah Loki
[1:06:06] jeffhunter12: i honestly i dont expect harrow to get beaten next episode
[1:06:07] RVIII: and I think What If?
[1:06:08] Norrak1: There was also an end credit
[1:06:09] leovic1: what if too right?
[1:06:13] raptorscream: What If too
[1:06:16] Eristaios: @Eristaios yeah true
[1:06:25] Gorn_Vernaleer: in UK a season is called a series, so maybe you are over thinking it
[1:06:29] LFC_Letters: Itll probably be one season and then set up Midnight Sons or something like that
[1:06:36] SavageCheez: They also said that Moonknight was supposed to be a 1 season show
[1:06:36] Cephyric: When did they change that last minute with Loki? Loki was the 1 show we knew was getting a second season before it came out
[1:06:39] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: probably means they are at least open to the possibility
[1:06:46] 00oniking00: i'm in for more moon knight
[1:06:50] Hundisilm: Brits use Series in the same way as the Muricans use Season though?
[1:06:52] Legionnare92: i dont midn cuz the plot grinded to halt and theres only one episode left :/
[1:07:00] CorporalPibb: could be they got renewed or some meta stuff due to multiverse craziness?
[1:07:08] xelan_star: only if oscar issac is involved
[1:07:08] Hundisilm: So it might've been just a oopsy by a brittish person at first
[1:07:20] zerohour_88: hoping the reception this series get can rope Oscar for more Marvel stuff
[1:07:22] Kunguru: Danny Ketch Ghost Rider!
[1:07:24] SolAlpha3: Will Steven come back?
[1:07:39] DobbsjustDobbs: You mean the 42 minute finale that will in no way resolve everything?
[1:07:40] Stormmaggeddon: I just need confirmation that we'll be getting more moon knight in the last episode
[1:07:43] Xanctius: Isnt steven dead though? his "role" isnt needed anymore really
[1:07:57] Hagaroth: I hope they don't kill arrow
[1:08:03] BuffaloTheory: @Hundisilm What do you mean? We use series to define the entire show and season to define each... well, season
[1:08:21] jeffhunter12: it sounds like hes both manipulating him and helping him in tandem
[1:08:27] Eristaios: ijpNODDERS
[1:08:32] CorporalPibb: ijpNODDERS
[1:08:45] Hyper_Remy: gassyJAM gassyJAM
[1:08:47] Aurugorn: too relatable
[1:08:58] Siggenlh: if they "kill off" steven. is it trully still "moon knight"
[1:09:02] Cephyric: BuffaloTheory Nah series and season is used interchangeably depending where you are. Season only really started being referenced around me as US-based stuff bled into UK culture
[1:09:25] TheAetherParadox: I am like... actually triggered
[1:09:28] TheAetherParadox: lol
[1:09:33] Hundisilm: @BuffaloTheory Really - I might just be crazy then :p
[1:09:39] Drakoni23: My theory is that the therapist is each alters individual "mind palace", their inner world. There are inconsistencies between the different ones.
[1:10:09] aethybryr: great point
[1:10:10] jeffhunter12: dr harrow even refers to how the mind fabricates these worlds
[1:10:10] GrannySith: Isn't that a sort of pastry? darkoHmm
[1:10:14] titanodin: a lot of times people do need to shut up too listen
[1:10:23] DobbsjustDobbs: This last episode has to save Steven, stop Harrow, introduce the third actor, and somehow lead into another series in 42 minutes. No way.
[1:10:39] Klarion21: Bill Lumberg is all i get
[1:10:44] Siggenlh: theere gonna be multiple season?
[1:10:51] DyingEros: Its combative at times. Most often.
[1:10:53] Osskssa: no
[1:10:57] Ravnim: let's just call your dead mom
[1:11:08] the_ch0: KEKW
[1:11:11] DyingEros: KEKW
[1:11:11] vaelindreth: KEKW
[1:11:16] Hyper_Remy: SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:11:17] MattiaV96: yes, bronze literally described therapy
[1:11:18] GrannySith: But wouldn't that version of Harrow be Marc/Steven's subconscious trying to gaslight themselves?
[1:11:22] Eristaios: omg is this universal ?
[1:11:25] titanodin: LOL
[1:11:25] bane0808: is @thatbronzegirl trans?
[1:11:26] Aurugorn: Clap
[1:11:26] Drakoni23: THAT phrase "Is this rational?" I've just been thinking, in the MCU, where we have literally aliens/gods walking among people, giant men coming out of the ocean, talking hippo doesn't seem that far on the "irrational" scale Jebaited
[1:11:27] thorborg99: the flashbacks
[1:12:05] gallahandro: @itmejp Empty Chair technique
[1:12:22] DyingEros: Sadge
[1:12:25] DyingEros: facts
[1:12:37] jeffhunter12: yup
[1:12:39] MattiaV96: therapy isn't even all the same, there are literally different therapists for different specialities
[1:12:46] jeffhunter12: gotta get to the acceptance stage
[1:12:56] Ravnim: they reverse psych my reverse psych D:
[1:12:59] MattiaV96: sometimes it's really hard to find the therapist woth the right area of exprtise
[1:13:03] DyingEros: Lets do the thing then. Like all the way.
[1:13:05] MattiaV96: with*
[1:13:13] DyingEros: Therapy is scary af man. It really makes you confront YOU.
[1:13:27] MattiaV96: @DyingEros yeah
[1:13:34] jeffhunter12: that might be what happens when harrow judges people
[1:13:46] DaRandalizer: well, sometimes you need to get angry to have the energy to be more honest to oneself
[1:14:00] rich16bit: so many questions for on ep
[1:14:27] rich16bit: *one
[1:14:50] jeffhunter12: too short
[1:14:51] Legionnare92: so much to do in an epiode!
[1:14:54] DobbsjustDobbs: Shortest finale episode
[1:14:55] tmn8: it would be kinda cool if jake took control while this was happening
[1:14:57] JBfromAccounting: Shortest finale for one of these MCU shows yet
[1:15:15] LFC_Letters: Loki was cool cause it was just messing with your mind
[1:15:17] LeelandGrant: i would be happy if the next episode ends with him "waking up" with all his personalities working together and harrow fight is next season
[1:15:20] TheAetherParadox: HARD Disagree. The last ep of loki was trash because they had to set up another season
[1:15:26] GrannySith: 42 minutes is cliffhanger length NODDERS
[1:15:28] thorborg99: doctor starange movie is only 2 hours
[1:15:28] jeffhunter12: very unlikely to resolve it next episode
[1:15:29] Cephyric: I don't get why they keep writing these shows into 6/8 episode seasons. After the first 3 shows you'd think Disney would be happy to put out 20 episode seasons safe in the knowledge that we will watch it no matter what
[1:15:41] Drakoni23: Maybe they have a twist in there that will shorten a buuunch of questions
[1:15:49] SolAlpha3: They'll prob wrap up ethan hawke
[1:15:54] StenSaxWTF: Herod gonna win
[1:16:00] LFC_Letters: id LOVE that, just Harrow torturing him forever LUL
[1:16:03] Brandling: Something something Mephisto
[1:16:14] Frost0555: I loved the Loki finale
[1:16:26] Docgalaad: @Cephyric i dont need 20 bland episodes with 14 fillers in the batch
[1:16:29] LFC_Letters: they said it was because they were mental
[1:16:30] jeffhunter12: because he wants to be locked up
[1:16:31] GrannySith: Because they're insane. LIke Marc said.
[1:16:36] NixonNarwhal: he wants to get help probably
[1:16:38] DobbsjustDobbs: Marc knows he's insane
[1:16:40] aethybryr: he thinks he deserves it
[1:16:42] Benkebur: The_rapist?
[1:16:44] jeffhunter12: he wants to get help
[1:16:46] Hundisilm: @Hundisilm You can google Doctor Who Series 9 and such though right?
[1:16:50] Omid18: he believes he is insane
[1:16:59] TheeKarn: Comfort vs security as well
[1:17:04] Hundisilm: Also wiki calls Doctor Who Seasons series
[1:17:24] zerohour_88: fwiw, Top Gear also uses series instead of seasons
[1:17:36] Osskssa: its purgatory
[1:17:37] Cephyric: Docgalaad There has clearly been enough room in the last 2/3 shows to at minimum have 12-16 episodes without them stretching story. So much they gotta skip around to fit it into 6
[1:17:40] Hundisilm: So  I am not crazy :)
[1:17:47] spideycsa: maybe he did as a child  helping to cope with his horrible mother and being involved in his brother's death
[1:17:50] normalnaut: I don't know if it means anything, but one of the orderlies we see over and over is the guy Steven watched the mummy priest embalm.
[1:17:53] SuitSizeSmall: Something that still bothers me is last episode Dr. Harrow said marc has been there since he was 12
[1:18:00] ThemDemo: I loved the Ancestral plan reference
[1:18:12] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:18:15] EvilBuho: I think we already seen Jake a few times
[1:18:16] Siggenlh: the pointy bits
[1:18:19] jeffhunter12: jake might be the uninhibited self
[1:18:22] Osskssa: @normalnaut the two orderlies were the cops in London
[1:18:25] SolAlpha3: pure fight
[1:18:25] LFC_Letters: I mean Marc gets the blame for Jake most of the time
[1:18:27] muffinface__: @itmeJP 5 head! Jake can only be seen by steven because mark does not know about him. That is why he was balanced when steven went into the sand?
[1:18:29] zerohour_88: red coffin, mind you
[1:18:33] Cephyric: Hundisilm You're not crazy, "series" is the generally used term here more often than not, but US culture bleeding into UK culture has meant that they are pretty interchangeable now
[1:18:37] Craxxbones: jake is the one with a cut nose
[1:18:49] Prrophett: Jake made an appearance in the episode btw
[1:19:16] Prrophett: outside the coffin I mean
[1:19:18] jeffhunter12: i love how throughout the episode they try to escape from one reality into another when confrontation happens
[1:19:20] Araymund: the construction is also a tool for them to balance the scales, produced subconsciously
[1:19:21] howitzah: was jake the one with the busted nose?
[1:19:31] SavageCheez: yes
[1:19:34] spideycsa: yup
[1:19:35] BlueSapphyre: yes.
[1:19:36] Craxxbones: yup
[1:19:51] br00zr: What fictional character is Jake modeled after?
[1:19:52] jeffhunter12: the villain aka confrontation
[1:19:55] EvilBuho: Jake is the one that asked the lady out, the one that looked at the camera pissed off. The one that likekly kill the fish and got a random replacement. ETC. Hes been in every single episode
[1:20:02] Drakoni23: Which is why Jake's Harrow has a syringe, the other ones don't
[1:20:09] spideycsa: jake is a cabby who is street smart
[1:20:24] ZergofImportance: Marc harrow and stevens harrow are different
[1:20:31] rich16bit: i was upset by Steven
[1:20:44] ZergofImportance: Marcos seems to me more antogonistic
[1:20:48] Osskssa: @EvilBuho thats what they want you to think
[1:20:52] the_ch0: All of the end songs were great
[1:21:05] DyingEros: The music has been 10/10
[1:21:10] DyingEros: Its been so god damn good
[1:21:10] jeffhunter12: weird having the spiritual manifestation of a personality get affected by the sand
[1:21:10] BuffaloTheory: @Hundisilm To be honest you and @Cephyric have thrown my entire understanding of the matter into question LUL I haven't used "series" that way in forever so my brain has clearly just deleted it to make room
[1:21:15] Siggenlh: wasnt that christian chanting at the end?
[1:21:33] Drakoni23: Loved watching reactions and everyone going "Wait, they won't end on that, right? No, no, noooo" LUL
[1:21:41] BlueSapphyre: speaking of the field of reeds. the call out for the ancestral plane got a pop from me.
[1:22:09] DyingEros: Seeing Steven actually fight back really hurt to watch him crumble. It was so.......man.
[1:22:11] DyingEros: Heartbreaking.
[1:22:25] LFC_Letters: Is there any chance we get anything Kang related, post credit etc.
[1:22:29] howitzah: steven gave me electric blanket from brave little toaster vibes
[1:22:31] jeffhunter12: also why wasnt anubis there
[1:22:43] DyingEros: @jeffhunter12 Anubis is locked up.
[1:22:48] spideycsa: hippo lady commented that she was just filling in
[1:22:49] Cephyric: BuffaloTheory You stop using language that you generally stop hearing, if everyone around you has adopted "season" then you have as well subconciously. I have the same thing with pronouncing youtube like an american does ("toob" not "choob")
[1:22:55] spideycsa: anubis might be a stone statue
[1:23:02] rich16bit: do you think Jake will take the body and take on Harrow
[1:23:02] zerohour_88: "Anubis is not gonna like this" or something
[1:23:05] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: @DyingEros But in my mind Steven died because Marc didnt need him anymore. They resolved that part of him
[1:23:09] EvilBuho: I think even thought they are saying it wont tie up with the MCU we are going to get a Blade Cameo
[1:23:12] jeffhunter12: @DyingEros yeah but why doesnt steven ask about that, its something he would ask about
[1:23:12] Zrmi: and 2 hearts
[1:23:13] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: Which is why his scales balanced
[1:23:20] normalnaut: I thought the scale was going to force them to reveal Jake
[1:23:25] frozen_eggo: maybe 2 personalities claiming ownership of the body is what made it unbalanced
[1:23:34] Sathias: I took it as it was unbalanced because there should have been 3 hearts but now that Steven is gone 2 hearts is balance.
[1:23:35] peaks102: Do we think there will be a big finale drop that connects to DS2 that comes out friday?
[1:23:42] jeffhunter12: she said it was about being the truth
[1:23:42] DyingEros: @jpcguy89 I get that but for the continuity of who and why he lives in MoonKnight.
[1:23:48] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: Fair
[1:23:54] Hundisilm: Good Riddance :p
[1:24:04] Drakoni23: It's weighted against the feather, not judged by a god
[1:24:05] CptArimus: well, if jake is tied to steven, then when steven is gone then jake is gone... right?
[1:24:06] sotasty_: isn't the final song saying "messiah of the sun"?
[1:24:11] Legionnare92: *shrugs*
[1:24:33] Wedrikul: @Legionnare92 this episode in a nutshell LUL
[1:24:37] A1rbanas: 'jake' hasn't been introduced yet, there's a lot of evidence saying so but that's just smoke right now
[1:24:54] bloodowl77: I really like the hippo lady
[1:25:01] NixonNarwhal: and then he remembers hes also jake LUL
[1:25:03] br00zr: Three personalities are unbalanced but two are?
[1:25:05] jeffhunter12: i think him falling off was more of a metaphor for them realising they are the same
[1:25:09] stresstest: will there be a Season 2 of moon knight ? feels like theres alot thats going to be missing after the last episode in 2 days
[1:25:14] Rednexi5: it was that they accepted each other I thought.
[1:25:28] Cephyric: Until the show confirms it it is fan theory thar Jake was in other episodes - See all the fan theory around Mephisto and Wandavision
[1:25:36] raptorscream: I dont think Mark is "happy" at the end, or content
[1:25:40] Hundisilm: That's why all the sociopaths go to heaven
[1:25:41] Rednexi5: and by accepting each other they balanced the scale.
[1:25:43] shadowoflight_: self worth
[1:25:48] Docgalaad: @stresstest probably revealed at the end of the season it is to be continued
[1:25:52] Drakoni23: So kinda like in Lucifer it isn't the devil keeping you in hell but your own guilt?
[1:25:56] lost2knight: I don't remember but at the end when the scales balanced were there still two hearts?
[1:26:05] Cotunu: it could have been unbalanced with two hearts because there is there personalities
[1:26:11] zerohour_88: kinda like Amit is judging you based on what you're gonna do vs what kind of person you are
[1:26:12] Wedrikul: @lost2knight yep
[1:26:13] BuggleStrus: Catharsis!
[1:26:17] spideycsa: listening to heavy metal takes the weight off me
[1:26:21] lost2knight: @Wedrikul thanks!
[1:26:28] Siggenlh: the big cry
[1:26:52] Stormmaggeddon: symbolic
[1:26:55] Xanctius: ok chat, who wrote on Bronzes glasses
[1:26:56] Hundisilm: I wonder how Darth Vader would fare with the feather
[1:26:58] LeelandGrant: Alegoric
[1:27:00] Imbadyoureworse: Thus the saying with a heavy heart
[1:27:03] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: The fact that we're having this in depth of a discussion about the meanings of what happened on the show is a testament how good it is
[1:27:04] jeffhunter12: think figurative heart
[1:27:05] lost2knight: Having a heart is a heavy burden
[1:27:36] Hundisilm: Damn dying in Egypt is a chore
[1:27:46] frozen_eggo: oh no a test!? girldmPanic
[1:27:48] Hundisilm: so much stuff you have to do
[1:27:48] Legionnare92: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:27:56] Legionnare92: cant we just die in peace
[1:27:58] Hagaroth: I'll just go to hell
[1:28:01] Klarion21: thank you, it bothers me that it wasn't anubis on the boat
[1:28:04] normalnaut: Thems the rules!
[1:28:18] Wedrikul: so anubis is stoned for sure
[1:28:24] WayneG947: Sounds legit, I think that's what the afterlife is SeemsGood
[1:28:24] AnyOtherSunday: Ammit actress?
[1:28:25] Wedrikul: since they were not there
[1:28:28] Hundisilm: I think we sa anubis stone
[1:28:33] jeffhunter12: if anubis is stoned thoth might be too
[1:28:39] Hundisilm: saw
[1:28:40] zerohour_88: since we're depicting child abuse now, might as well go the distance
[1:28:41] Drakoni23: It's also not Anubis which I found odd and might have meaning? Tawret even had queue cards to do it right
[1:28:50] Hundisilm: when Kenshu was put on the shelv
[1:28:52] frozen_eggo: poor ppl gotta walk?
[1:28:53] Hundisilm: shelf
[1:29:07] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: Do we think Khonshu gets free?
[1:29:14] Imbadyoureworse: Yea lol she had queue cards
[1:29:17] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: Cus if he doesnt he cant become Moon Knight again
[1:29:19] Imbadyoureworse: That was cool
[1:29:24] jeffhunter12: Exactly jp
[1:29:28] WayneG947: that's 32 minutes
[1:29:29] jeffhunter12: im so confused
[1:29:31] xenorifle: "Damn Hippos getting on our boats and stealing our jobs" - Anubis probably
[1:29:34] Hundisilm: I mean he is still in the same room with Ethan Hawke
[1:29:37] Kunguru: Jake kills the hippo
[1:29:37] Hundisilm: just lying in the pool there
[1:29:42] Affly01: well, it'll either be super good or it'll be super deus ex machina
[1:29:43] spideycsa: Scarlet Scarab might show up through layla?
[1:29:43] Hundisilm: not far to go
[1:29:44] Legionnare92: in a choppy edited way prob
[1:29:48] Siggenlh: he took Alexanders ride for a joyrid
[1:29:49] Redvelvet84: probably the head sticking out the planet will do something.
[1:29:53] LFC_Letters: theres no Marc or Steven next episode and its all Jake... id love that sooo much
[1:30:10] Imbadyoureworse: When the guy comes out of the ocean he grabs them on the way
[1:30:12] Drakoni23: Question: Do we free all the gods by the end?
[1:30:14] LessSanity: aren't the gods that are left pretty much gods of order
[1:30:46] Legionnare92: didnt they say hes still got bullets in him? like if he comes back he cant heal still
[1:30:51] Cephyric: Gotta assume that Amit has been freed for the final fight, otherwise how is Harrow ever gonna match up to Moon Knight?
[1:31:02] Doctor_Von_Decency: @itmeJP i wager Jake is still in the asylum cause hes unresolved and he's gonna bust Steven and Marc out of the afterlife
[1:31:05] jeffhunter12: it would make no sense for that to be konshu
[1:31:13] jeffhunter12: its his marcs mind
[1:31:16] Devlind: I dont think there is a second season sadly
[1:31:18] zerohour_88: Jake can just be a reveal and the explanation comes later
[1:31:34] ApathyOwl: a reflection that stays when he walks past a mirror or something
[1:31:37] vaelindreth: LUL
[1:31:43] TheAetherParadox: AND THEN THEY KISS
[1:31:47] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: I want one of these shows to just have a secret extra episode. that would be so sick
[1:31:54] Osskssa: no second season would of green lit it already plus feige has this all planned out
[1:31:58] Imbadyoureworse: Well there is some debate in the comics as to whether konshu is just an alter of Marc’s and not real @jeffhunter12  but they haven’t really gone that way it doesn’t seem like
[1:32:10] Imbadyoureworse: In the show
[1:32:11] Cephyric: Why does he need to be dragged in right away?
[1:32:17] Drakoni23: Which I'd be fine with. I like how Marc and Stephen are real, individual characters and not just a gimmick of someone "changing personality", no the alters are more than that.
[1:32:21] PariahPaladin: I was really hoping that it was Rama-Tut in the sarcophagus.
[1:32:21] raptorscream: 2018
[1:32:24] jeffhunter12: @Imbadyoureworse yeah it seems pretty established that konshu is its own entity
[1:32:26] bernienard_: Howwee, I thought they were talking bout Dr. Strange. Panicked quick.
[1:32:26] MrDigitalCypher: Steven isn't a "real physical person" so how could he die in the sands?  Steven is still around. Mark just hasn't thought him back.
[1:32:34] SlipCrit: did we mention that tawaret mentions black panther heaven?
[1:32:37] Ceaseless_: its post snap based on the ad on the bus
[1:32:38] Hundisilm: Snap happened in one of the verses right?
[1:32:39] raptorscream: Passport was 2018 or 2019
[1:32:40] LFC_Letters: They have the post snap posters up
[1:32:47] raptorscream: and Post Snap posters
[1:32:52] LFC_Letters: of the rehomeing or whatever it was
[1:32:52] Legionnare92: "thanos was a right bloke" on a pub wall somewhere
[1:33:00] Imbadyoureworse: @jeffhunter12 they would have to really pull the rug on us to make it ambiguous at all in the show based on what we have seen yea
[1:33:04] raptorscream: @Legionnare92 that wasHawkeye
[1:33:05] VeloRama: episode improved alot over ep4 cohhGG
[1:33:07] Osskssa: post snap ads on busses in london
[1:33:09] Stormmaggeddon: oh yeah they did mention the ancestral plains or whatever
[1:33:13] ShaggyTh3Dog: If its pre snap couldnt all those souls arriving also be the snap?
[1:33:13] Brandling: The passport could be fake :)
[1:33:21] Xanctius: Doctor Huey
[1:33:28] Legionnare92: @raptorscream thats the joke
[1:33:33] accallon: moon knight demanding his money from dracula as a after credit scene
[1:33:37] WayneG947: Ah Dr Huey, the Chinese knockoff Dr who
[1:33:43] Frost0555: @stormmaggeddon yes in this episode
[1:33:44] Osskssa: @ShaggyTh3Dog no that was Harrow, Twaret said it was souls judged before thier time
[1:33:44] raptorscream: @raptorscream Sorry Marvel Die Hard
[1:33:48] spideycsa: hey dracula you big nerd
[1:33:54] profnesbitt: Sorry just coming in. But did Steven create Jake to take the abuse. He definitely seems to come out in extreme fight or flight situations.
[1:33:58] Siggenlh: start, middle and end is very strong in this series
[1:34:06] frozen_eggo: we need more zack snyder cut type things, LONG movies but in chapters
[1:34:07] ShaggyTh3Dog: @Osskssa True! <3
[1:34:23] Hundisilm: @frozen_eggo No thank you :)
[1:34:31] Cephyric: frozen_eggo So you mean 12+ episode TV shows? :p
[1:34:33] Doctor_Von_Decency: @profnesbitt they agreed that's probably the case! marc hides through steven and steven hides through jake
[1:34:33] Hundisilm: Just do a miniseries then or something
[1:34:43] AN71V1RU5: I agree, just rewtached Loki as well, it was fantastic.
[1:34:48] WayneG947: Remember 22 episode shows, damn that was rough
[1:35:02] shadowoflight_: there are people who only care about the action
[1:35:12] Hundisilm: I dunno the first two episodes was fine in my opinion
[1:35:14] Drakoni23: Good thing is, this is phase 1 of D+ shows and they can now take from those first few what people liked/disliked. And with how much the movies have improved from 1 to 3, I can only imagine how much better the shows will get over the next few years
[1:35:15] Imbadyoureworse: Bronze is onto something with the pacing
[1:35:17] Frost0555: Yeah, pretty much everything about Loki I like
[1:35:24] jeffhunter12: the first 2 episodes were rather good imo
[1:35:25] frozen_eggo: I mean a 4-6 hour video broken into chapters
[1:35:31] Drakoni23: They still need to figure out how much show or movie they can do in the show format
[1:35:31] jeffhunter12: just not entirely what i wanted from moon knight
[1:35:42] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[1:35:51] CorporalPibb: these shows is probably best viewed all in one sitting
[1:36:05] Hundisilm: I think Wanda was hype very much because it was the first
[1:36:05] ruiyolas: these are superhero shows, they need to have action scenes
[1:36:10] raptorscream: Loki and Wanda are also Known characters from former movies, MoonKnight, about a crazy guy
[1:36:19] Hundisilm: I don't think it would do that well if it was realeased now comparatively
[1:36:23] Cephyric: frozen_eggo a 6 hour movie brokwn into 6 chapters? You could probably give that a pretty snappy name, maybe something that starts with an "S"? ;)
[1:36:37] raptorscream: @Cephyric Spider-Man?
[1:36:41] Redvelvet84: think the hype came more from being established MCU heros, compared to "new"  characters.
[1:36:50] Affly01: Wanda and Loki are much more fantastic and super like tbh, Moon Knight had one "super" scene
[1:36:51] raptorscream: ^
[1:37:00] frozen_eggo: I just mean a longer movie format rather than shoehorned tv episodes
[1:37:02] peaks102: tbh those were released when we had kind of a marvel drought cause of covid.  Now we have a lot of marvel content coming out regularly
[1:37:11] Cephyric: raptorscream Perfect, rolls right off the tongue too. "Hey, you see that latest Spider-Man?"
[1:37:13] profnesbitt: I just hope they don’t takeaway that is has lower ratings because it isn’t constantly referencing the greater MCU.
[1:37:15] BlueSapphyre: it's like agents of shield. S1 and S2 are dull, and then it takes off from S3 onwards.
[1:37:19] jeffhunter12: You have to build up to these moments
[1:37:23] Sonatta: Falcon and WInter Soldier were Steve's bros
[1:37:26] Hundisilm: Wanda isn't a side character?
[1:37:30] Siggenlh: DnD episodes be like skip the first 10 sessions
[1:37:33] VeloRama: i'm actually hyped again for moon knight after last weeks episode. was just wild without any bullshit
[1:37:45] raptorscream: what's wrong with MCU Die Hard?
[1:37:51] Siggenlh: Falcon who again LUL
[1:37:52] Imbadyoureworse: I enjoyed falcon and winter soldier for the most part
[1:38:00] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: I loved the Hawkeye series
[1:38:01] Frost0555: @hundisilm no lol
[1:38:02] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: wtf
[1:38:07] raptorscream: @Siggenlh Clarence
[1:38:14] bernienard_: Why do people love Moonknight so much? I still don't see it, 5 episodes in.
[1:38:14] LFC_Letters: cant wait for Groot to say "I am Groot" for six weeks and im gonna love it LUL
[1:38:29] Sonatta: watching Wanda was like watching Mando... very 1 sitting binge-able
[1:38:38] Imbadyoureworse: @bernienard_  it might not be for you. That’s ok
[1:38:40] Frost0555: @jpcguy89 yeah I like Hawkeye
[1:38:41] GTrakl: @bernienard_ It's ok for people to like, or not like, different things
[1:38:58] DD_The_Shmey: naw i like the weird in the middle
[1:39:07] DD_The_Shmey: weird up front makes people stop watching
[1:39:10] jeffhunter12: hes also unproven
[1:39:12] bernienard_: I'm asking why though. I'm trying to understand what the Hook is? I loved the Eternals, but many didn't.
[1:39:22] A1rbanas: he's weirder than deadpool?
[1:39:25] Siggenlh: too little wierd shit comming too late
[1:39:25] Imbadyoureworse: They had to figure out how to introduce the character. The others were established
[1:39:39] MrGein_182: @bernienard_ yeah i fell asleep in every episode. i takes me a week to watch 1 episode
[1:39:40] EvilBuho: Man you all need to watch Legion lol
[1:39:43] raptorscream: @bernienard_ people are hyped for MK because of the comics
[1:39:52] Hundisilm: @bernienard_ The characters are quite interesting :)
[1:39:59] DD_The_Shmey: you got to bait them in with content the viewers are able to understand and follow, and then once they are invested only then do you challenge their conception of the show and flip the script. This makes it an exciting experiance
[1:40:07] DrTazerFace: Legion was terrible
[1:40:15] Hundisilm: wut?
[1:40:20] InternetPlumber: saying the first episode is just the trailer assumes everyone watches the trailers
[1:40:21] Benkebur: Fudgethenorm
[1:40:29] CorporalPibb: I know family members who would give up if the show got too "complicated" at the start
[1:40:33] Imbadyoureworse: People KNEW Loki though
[1:40:33] vaelindreth: KKona
[1:40:36] SouthernBiscuits: mee maw minutes
[1:40:40] KanganLogan: But Loki was a very established character
[1:40:50] VeloRama: well, i almost didn't continue watching after ep4 and i had no idea who moon knight is. so yeah, pretty much spot on LUL
[1:40:57] Imbadyoureworse: Like my mom knows Loki so she is in from the movies. She doesn’t know anything about moonkight
[1:40:59] DD_The_Shmey: yeah @KanganLogan 100% true, people already invested
[1:41:02] LeelandGrant: Severance starts weird and keeps at it. It can work if you trust your story
[1:41:05] Drakoni23: They just "Do the thing", just like Spiderman No way home just "did the thing"
[1:41:12] Osskssa: hated Loki, didnt feel like Loki at all
[1:41:13] DD_The_Shmey: I disagree with bronze on this take
[1:41:17] Hundisilm: Loki was already the best character of the show characters pre shows to be fair
[1:41:27] profnesbitt: That’s what I’m going to assume happens in dr strange 2. 5 minute lore dump and then jumping into all the crazy shit.
[1:41:34] Legionnare92: so... predictions for this week?
[1:41:37] DD_The_Shmey: @Osskssa Loki was my favorite series
[1:41:58] Frost0555: @dd_the_shmey Loki is just great
[1:42:18] Osskssa: @DD_The_Shmey got through 3 episodes i was bored in every one couldnt finish it, loved all the other series
[1:42:21] Omid18: I really liked episode 1...
[1:42:26] raptorscream: Jackal = Anubis Dog
[1:42:26] Imbadyoureworse: But again Wanda is established with normal audiences . I think that’s the difference. But that’s just me
[1:42:31] Siggenlh: Loki only got interesting once they got to the void Imo
[1:42:40] EvilBuho: I think I said it a few times, but Chat if you liked Moon Knight Episode 5, go watch Legion in FX. 3 seasons of that and it gets more ridiculous as it goes.
[1:43:01] Drakoni23: I really wish D+ shows would release 2 per week. Like Arcane did 3 a week
[1:43:09] Frost0555: @evilbuho Watched it before Moon Knight, it was fun
[1:43:14] normalnaut: Legion is easily the most bonkers Marvel thing ever.
[1:43:16] DD_The_Shmey: I was hooked into loki from episode 1, and was 100% engaged with each episode riding the roller coaster
[1:43:20] Siggenlh: Diney aint got enough stuff on it for it to be worth my time with 1 week hiatuses and then month long ones
[1:43:21] VeloRama: that was actually OK. your protagonist getting shot and then the second half of the episode is some wierd shit about an asylum that doesn't make sense was way worse
[1:43:22] spideycsa: I can think of a million hooks, and they all deal with fishin'
[1:43:24] normalnaut: Also, some of the darkest
[1:43:42] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[1:43:44] GrannySith: Idk, I was hooked after the first episode basically without knowing anything about the character. 🤷
[1:43:44] rich16bit: They should have dr harrow talking to mark in the asylum
[1:43:46] sotasty_: true ijpNODDERS
[1:44:04] rich16bit: ijpNODDERS
[1:44:25] EvilBuho: For sure @normalnaut , I would flip if he somehow shows up in something MCU related but very doubtful. Such a good series
[1:44:28] KanganLogan: @GrannySith Same
[1:44:37] Rednexi5: Harrow saying bring him in. then cut to Steve.
[1:44:46] Affly01: the scenes where stuff happens without Steven or Marc seeing it would give it away anyway
[1:44:48] Rednexi5: just doing stuff in London.
[1:44:50] AnyOtherSunday: all the references in the asylym wouldnt have been there
[1:44:50] WDForty: oh man, the glass in the shoes man, in all the scenes with him, you can hear the glass when he takes steps
[1:44:51] Imbadyoureworse: One thing the show doesn’t have that some of the best moon knight runs DO have is that it’s ambiguous as to what is actually real
[1:45:20] Zrmi: Because the main character isn't likeable for a lot of people. A lot of people just don't like Steven/Mark
[1:45:21] Drakoni23: Got to say, I usually find "and it's all a dream" very frustrating in media. So I might just wait out til the whole show drops before I get too invested week to week for it all to be forgotten or not real
[1:45:37] Sophiaan31: Inversely, I had a coworker whose not in the marvel ecosystem going have you seen this moon knight thing? It's crazyyyyyy
[1:45:42] andigawa: most of my friends wait for d+ shows to be finished before starting to binge them.
[1:45:46] AnyOtherSunday: What about the red scarab on Layla's pinky in the asylum ?
[1:45:47] Aythers: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. Just start the show doing Taxes
[1:45:54] Drakoni23: I'm glad that it seems like they really did their research on DID.
[1:45:57] Sophiaan31: And I was like Oh yes lets talk about it
[1:46:00] profnesbitt: I think it’s going to end ambiguous and lean more into is it real. Like after he beats harrow as moon knight at the very end the last shot is jake standing in the drs office with that sharp triangle sticking out of Dr version of Harrow laying dead on the table.
[1:46:09] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: Anyone remember The Lone Gunment
[1:46:11] Doctor_Von_Decency: that was Awake for me :/
[1:46:12] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: Gunmen*
[1:46:12] spideycsa: a lot of my friends wait until the entire series is out before watching it, so I usually have to wait before talking to them about everything
[1:46:16] AnyOtherSunday: There is a red scarab character in the comics
[1:46:29] ImAFanOfDeliciousFlavor: The Lone Gunmen is one of my favorite shows of all time and got canceled SO quickly
[1:46:49] EightBitDelight: I use my kids to judge how general audience reacts to Marvel production. They have sat through every movies without asking once to get up and pee. Last MK episode, we paused twice.
[1:46:54] VeloRama: defo ep5 for me
[1:46:56] bernienard_: Disney needs to do the Netflix Episode Dump for new IPs like Moonkight.
[1:47:12] Sonatta: I bet if Daredevil showed up in Moonknight it'd pop off
[1:47:18] DD_The_Shmey: yeah
[1:47:44] Hundisilm: I think The Expanse didn't do too well viewership wise at first either - but its probably the best SciFi show in the relatively near past :p
[1:47:49] ApathyOwl: Crungo
[1:47:52] shadowoflight_: vs the LEGEND of MORBIUS
[1:47:53] Spools_: lol
[1:48:08] Sonatta: the first few episodes of The Expanse are very rough
[1:48:26] Hundisilm: @Sonatta I dunno I sort of got hooked on the first episode :)
[1:48:30] Zrmi: @Hundisilm viewers were pretty good actually. The show was just too expensive to make for Syfy.
[1:48:36] DD_The_Shmey: i wanna see moon knight pop up in another show, and the characters in the show have no idea who he is, and Moon Knight just beats the crap out of one bad guy, and then leaves, leaving everyone in the regular cast looking around going "Who the F#$k was that??"
[1:48:54] Sonatta: @Hundisilm the books are what hooked me :)
[1:48:58] da3mon_01: There was also some Hungarian in the desert for some reason
[1:49:01] Docgalaad: @Hundisilm i was too. But felt very disappointed by the second one. They put too much money in the pilot.
[1:49:09] icawn_: I rewatched episode 3 forgetting I already watched it. I find the story very uninteresting. The acting is great though and that is why I stuck to it.
[1:49:18] Hundisilm: @Sonatta If you read the books first you are gonna have a very different perspective
[1:49:21] bernienard_: Ms. Marvel feels very americanized.
[1:49:31] WDForty: i agree with Bronze, that's how things should be done
[1:49:38] Sonatta: i still can't get over Ms Marvel's power change
[1:49:38] WDForty: present it as just normal
[1:50:38] Imbadyoureworse: It is kinda important to his character
[1:50:47] zymioi: i love characters that have diverse back ground but they are just there no one has to point it out there just going threw the story
[1:50:47] Stormmaggeddon: I don't think that complaint holds any water
[1:50:48] raptorscream: America is weird to thej rest of the world, Bronze
[1:50:59] bernienard_: America is so addicted to race when other countries just play it normal.
[1:51:03] 00oniking00: america is butt hurt
[1:51:10] LeelandGrant: Hannibal Lector should be played by a cannibal

[1:51:14] Munetani_NJimha: It's just america
[1:51:20] Munetani_NJimha: They don't know what acting means
[1:51:25] Saunt: cause they are ACTORs aslong as they protray it well its fine
[1:51:29] Sonatta: it's american virtue signaling and guilt
[1:51:30] Cephyric: The whole point of acting is that you play roles that don't always reflect your actual life right?
[1:51:39] Imbadyoureworse: I think the casting was really good
[1:51:52] zymioi: lol we are watching bones and u can tell its day time tv in 2000 lol
[1:52:19] bernienard_: In the Philippines, you'll see darkened skins to depict the natives of the country, on very Asian actors/actresses and that's normal.
[1:52:36] 00oniking00: @Cephyric most of the time but not so long ago people lost jobs in voice acting in video games and cartoons becouse diferent race
[1:53:01] raptorscream: Bronze haters Wanda!!!
[1:53:06] raptorscream: :D
[1:53:14] jeffhunter12: the point of acting is to play someone you arent
[1:53:25] raptorscream: Oscar is carrying hard the show
[1:53:45] spideycsa: I think eathan does a great job in it too
[1:53:48] spideycsa: ethan
[1:53:50] raptorscream: REAL Mark, screaming at the sight of the Hppo lady, so out of character, up to that point
[1:54:02] Saunt: Hollywood USE to do it, but I guess people getting "offended for others" somehow makes them afraid
[1:54:13] LFC_Letters: any predictions for the finale?
[1:54:15] Hundisilm: @spideycsa You mean the two characters who are bout 90% of the show are pretty good? :p
[1:54:16] raptorscream: there were Spoiler Tags?
[1:54:30] the_ch0: PepeLaugh
[1:54:31] leovic1: KEKW
[1:54:32] spideycsa: @Hundisilm who whoulda thought right?
[1:55:03] Barrh: and 6 just feels like not enough to be satisfying
[1:55:08] Stormmaggeddon: I think it makes sense, most people are going to be able to binge all 6 episodes
[1:55:11] Hundisilm: I blame Zack Snyder for this nonsense
[1:55:13] LeelandGrant: If you do that, don't release it weekly!
[1:55:24] LFC_Letters: they make a 6 hour movie and still run out of time
[1:55:25] zymioi: i starting to like movies that turn in to tv shows
[1:55:39] Drakoni23: Think it would be fine if it was released differently. 2-3 episodes per week
[1:55:47] SpaceDive: wish it would release all at once
[1:55:47] Frost0555: Yeah they need more episodes
[1:55:49] NixonNarwhal: Budget should not be a word that applies to disney
[1:56:04] Saunt: you ain't Britsh, dont do 6 episodes
[1:56:04] gidley_: YES!. 8-9 would be great
[1:56:12] LFC_Letters: even if the episodes are a bit shorter, just more episodes
[1:56:17] Ravnim: 6 ep is nice when it's hour long eps
[1:56:19] SolAlpha3: at least don't resolve 5 hours in the last 45 minutes
[1:56:20] raptorscream: and Loki was the same
[1:56:23] zymioi: yes they should do 10 ep hr long
[1:56:34] Drakoni23: The best show with 6 episodes is Good Omens. There it really works
[1:56:52] raptorscream: what if it's Moon Knight in the 3rd coffin, the actual suit
[1:57:06] Docgalaad: save the world from harrow is S2
[1:57:07] Cephyric: You watch the bait-and-switch be that the third coffin is Konshu and Jake is never mentioned
[1:57:15] Hundisilm: I dunno you can do stuff with 6 episodes - just the pacing needs to be correct
[1:57:22] shadowoflight_: I'm sure harrow will not be done in this season
[1:57:28] MrMoogleberry: 42 minutes and there's intro and outro in there
[1:57:29] LFC_Letters: 42 mins with credits too
[1:57:31] Stormmaggeddon: secret 7th episode Kappa
[1:57:33] AlsoZen: If 6 episodes, make them 1.5h. How long was an ep of Sherlock (the BBC one)?
[1:57:37] EvilBuho: They do have to make them at least 2 hour finales
[1:57:39] profnesbitt: We don’t have to get out of the psych ward. I think return to jake killing dr narrow will be the last shot of the show in the psych ward.
[1:57:41] Iko336: it's kinda weird that the last episode of these shows is usually not the longest
[1:57:45] Imbadyoureworse: The most obvious third alter thing is when the knife guys are killed but Marc and Steven didn’t do it
[1:57:56] raptorscream: 3
[1:57:57] Cephyric: Docgalaad There were shots on MK vs an Amit-powered Harrow in the original trailer, that's 100% the third act of the finale
[1:57:59] Heisuisui: yohoho
[1:58:05] Hundisilm: @AlsoZen I wann asy they were 1 hour things?
[1:58:08] raptorscream: what if it's Moon Knight in the 3rd coffin, the actual suit @itmeJP
[1:58:17] LeelandGrant: just releaase 3 episodes per week then
[1:58:21] SolAlpha3: It's like STTNG where they solve everything in the last 10 minutes. I hated that.
[1:58:21] Drakoni23: Or you skip week 1 and sub for 2 months
[1:58:22] Frost0555: @iko336 Hawkeyes last episode was the longest I think
[1:58:25] Saunt: @raptorscream they have set up so much for a 3rd person that its not Moon Knight, we saw their broken nose bandage, heard their accent sl;ip out and how marc and Steven are confused by who is killing the people
[1:58:29] Redvelvet84: people who worry bout money just binge once its all out, so only 1 month paid
[1:58:37] Zrmi: @raptorscream they talked about that pretty often
[1:58:44] AlsoZen: @Hundisilm Yeah that could be
[1:58:48] zymioi: Disney shows feel like Korea show but they have the martial to make it work
[1:58:53] Hundisilm: @AlsoZen Sherlock isn't a "one story" thing though mostly
[1:58:57] raptorscream: @Saunt im thinking maybe it's MK in there, that helps them, and Jack beats Hosptial Harrow
[1:59:01] profnesbitt: Did both Mark and Steven see the third coffin or just one of them when they walked by?
[1:59:05] Hundisilm: There is an arc but mostly each episode is its own thing
[1:59:08] Barrh: not counting intro/credits?
[1:59:22] Cephyric: Minus like 8 minutes from each episode for EP/OP
[1:59:27] AlsoZen: Yeah, the 3-6 episodes won't work for this
[1:59:40] Iko336: i think it's about 4 hours 6x40 min without credits roughly
[1:59:46] Saunt: @raptorscream is the suit even its own personality?
[2:00:15] zymioi: avatar korra ** not korea lol
[2:00:18] raptorscream: @Saunt no, maybe in Marks head could be, Steve summoned the suit
[2:00:18] uberfalter: obiwan

[2:00:34] ThemDemo: Late May
[2:00:37] Frost0555: Obi Wan is May 27th

It may be a few hours after the end of a broadcast before we can reupload them. YouTube uploads will continue at usual pace.

[2:17:28] eviltox: @Strivus Guardians of the galaxy was a good game, ty for work
[2:17:33] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: Embracer has a lot of good will with me. They are trying to create a museum of every video game ever made. And their CEO of that department is a swedish retro youtuber I grew up watching. So it seems like they arent out of touch.
[2:18:04] NercesK: cohhJam
[2:19:04] thanh_n2004: @SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD i'm happy to hear that, i don't know much about em.
[2:19:19] eviltox: imagine open world deus ex game with next gent graphics. they can call it Deus ex 2177...
[2:19:42] Kaleith: ijpHI everyone
[2:19:45] Strivus: @eviltox ty, glad you enjoyed it :)
[2:20:05] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: @thanh_n2004 a lot of people dont. I guess I found out about them earlier since I'm swedish. They own like 300 games currently being made. They bought gearbox and a LOT of midsize studios.
[2:20:31] Siggenlh: hard to tell what embracer gonna do. its a giant corporation. with tentacles into gearbox aswell
[2:20:58] Hasan_Lurker: coxDance
[2:21:14] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: embracer seems to be pretty handsoff. they have shown willingness to let studios set their own deadlines etc.
[2:21:15] iilu: hypeE
[2:21:22] eviltox: After Wonderlands, i would never buy another gearbox game
[2:21:23] Siggenlh: embracer is what THQ Nordic turned into when THQ exploded in bankruptcy.
[2:21:27] Mud__: hypeE
[2:21:27] Gorn_Vernaleer: coxJam coxJam coxJam ijpTOTSUGEKI

[2:21:58] GoDoWaR: ijpDANCE
[2:22:03] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: yeah embracer is THQ nordic.
[2:22:11] Siggenlh: embracer seems like a leech of gamedevs. but atleast they let them do their own thing seemingly.
[2:22:17] Shin_gx: atpDance coxDance catJAM crendorCatjam coxJam crendorCatjam crendorCatjam coxDance atpDance
[2:22:20] BlueSapphyre: Embracer recently bought Asmodee, one of the largest board game publishers.
[2:22:36] CyranoBeoulve: @Gorn_Vernaleer hopium hard for Legacy of Kain here lol
[2:22:44] toaobadger: when does the mcu crew vod drop on youtube? just missed the stream
[2:22:46] Siggenlh: had no idea coffestain was under embracer. says alot about them trying to keep their branding in the uknown
[2:22:52] eviltox: thing with Embracer, they dont do budget like Squre, so games will be pretty modest
[2:23:08] Foozzie: watch them cancel ff14
[2:23:21] Strivus: @Foozzie they wont LUL
[2:23:24] Darkaros: @Siggenlh coffeestain had to do a big twitter post distancing themselves from thq nordic (I think it was?) when they did a dumb
[2:23:25] BlueSapphyre: @Gorn_Vernaleer I don't know what more they can do with Legacy of Kain, the story felt very final. unless it's a remaster/remake.
[2:23:27] Siggenlh: @eviltox wouldnt say that since most of those budgets are all about marketing.
[2:24:00] Siggenlh: @Darkaros Embracer is THQ Nordic or what it turned into. it has just spun off the label into its own thing.
[2:24:19] eviltox: @Siggenlh Embracer is kinda bad in marketing they also don't do HUGE marketing campaigns
[2:24:35] Siggenlh: @Darkaros was just on the embracer site and there was a satisfactory image there
[2:24:36] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: I like the trend toward AA games because they can be more creative and niche.
[2:24:55] eviltox: AA = no Guardians 2
[2:25:00] yrvengalied: @Darkaros @AinzN ijpH ijpLOVE
[2:25:14] Siggenlh: Randy pitchford is still running gearbox. so i dont think embracer really cares. well saide for normal corpostuff.
[2:25:16] Gorn_Vernaleer: @eviltox weren't they also the guys behind the infamously boring KOCH Media Showcase thing?
[2:25:18] Siggenlh: *aside
[2:25:42] OuroborosChemist: you dont need that much marketing if you're in niche category your fans will buy product if its good  other will not regardless of marketing
[2:25:50] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: @eviltox Yeah but at least they have publicly said that their focus is single player games. so no live services etc. like square enix wants
[2:26:05] Strivus: All I can say from this morning's town hall is that the future of Dues Ex and Legacy of Kain are very bright ;)

[2:26:53] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: @darkaros context o:
[2:27:11] eviltox: @SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD It's good but. i've yet to see a really good game from them. 7 or 8 out of 10 yes, but not a single 10 out of 10

[2:27:37] yrvengalied: @Darkaros embracer is the trading part of thq nordic they just separated the business from the development studio parts
[2:27:44] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: @eviltox yeah that seems to be their model. Might change now that they have bought more high end studios.

[2:31:12] Siggenlh: this does like a giant waste of money? nobody who cares about these people gonna care about this ad. and those who dont aint gonna care
[2:31:16] Hauseman: Youtube needs a better interface.
[2:31:22] zerohour_88: YT chat is so damn bad tho
[2:31:22] JaseLeland: he means first of many recent
[2:31:22] yrvengalied: basically YT is capitalizing on the Twitch new policy leaks

[2:31:45] WayneG947: Vader from GTA RP
[2:31:45] AN71V1RU5: lupo, valk
[2:31:45] Difficulty_Level: twitch isn't agreeing to match what twitch is paying, the meta narrative?
[2:31:45] nobelx: What would make you leave to go to YouTube? Better contract? Or Twitch continuing to fuck streamers over?
[2:31:47] Siggenlh: with how the new contracts gonna be. they gonna bleed talent alot.
[2:31:48] hawk_moth: Dr Disrespect. KEKW
[2:31:51] Osskssa: chance on YT to grow isnt good, so its def for the money

[2:33:33] JaseLeland: syk has 3m subs on youtube, he won't lose viewership
[2:33:33] Siggenlh: unless they are exclusives they gonna costream on twtich once twitch gets new contracts to double dip.
[2:33:35] Shoaron: @yrvengalied, ijpBOOP
[2:33:35] GregoryGlen: AD revenue split will make up for the sub loss
[2:33:40] eviltox: International viewership on YT is much better
[2:33:40] larkhill: discoverability suffers on yt. when u have the community already, yt is great
[2:33:45] Imbadyoureworse: I’d miss you Sadge

[2:33:59] zerohour_88: salivating on those superchats
[2:34:00] Osskssa: @JaseLeland he will cos those 3 mill watch his vids not him streaming
[2:34:07] OuroborosChemist: @oaktree3 as per with anything else rly
[2:34:08] Hasan_Lurker: I'm only on twitch because I ran out of hasan videos to watch on youtube
[2:34:21] ryukenchi: yeah i think some of them are doing better on yt than twitch
[2:34:28] Siggenlh: i dont think hasan will switch platforms. but he likely gonna costream. since hes about reach
[2:34:31] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: some OTV people might actually gain viewers from going to youtube
[2:34:37] zerohour_88: YT player is much better for me too
[2:34:42] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[2:35:10] JaseLeland: @Osskssa I don't know, I watch lud, rae, etc. on occasion. they all have good viewership. lud had 60k last night for example
[2:35:12] WayneG947: whats Twitch Prime? Kspps
[2:35:19] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: the best part of the youtube player is you can seemlessly watch 2x speed to catch up
[2:35:21] tamgc: discoverability is better on YT too...like I found out about sykkuno on YT before I ever did on twitch
[2:35:35] ItsBatsy: Unless youtube makes the player and chat experience better I will never watch a youtube stream its so bad
[2:35:47] Hundisilm: YOu think Google can accomplish what Microsoft could not?
[2:35:51] Hasan_Lurker: coxBongo
[2:35:52] nobelx: YouTube has the inbuilt donation "superchat" feature as well with more of that money going to the creator (or so i believe)
[2:36:01] VeloRama: chat on YT is pretty bad though
[2:36:05] Tronix_604: @itmejp  I think they may try to incorporate YouTube premium into something like a twitch prime
[2:36:09] Reckless_Rob: Thats disgusting
[2:36:14] zerohour_88: @ItsBatsy chat, sure, YT chat is bad but the player is so much smoother
[2:36:23] Reckless_Rob: Oh ok
[2:36:41] ryukenchi: ive never heard of mr beast
[2:36:46] thanh_n2004: as a stream lurker, youtube's chat doesn't bother me much
[2:36:46] Archangel3003: That stream was during my bed time so missed it
[2:36:48] oaktree3: so much monies how
[2:36:49] Reckless_Rob: I mean twitch player is fine
[2:36:53] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: poker tournament with streamers is usually funny because they are content brained
[2:36:54] Siggenlh: @ryukenchi lucky you.
[2:36:54] AwesomeKingPho: As a poker stream, it sucked. Dwan was bored as hell playing against them. As a fun stgream, probably good.
[2:36:54] ReginaldXIV: YT chat brings my browser to a halt
[2:36:57] VeloRama: also, no channel offline chat on YT as far as i'm aware
[2:36:57] DyingEros: Everyone says smoother but it don't really notice a difference in quality tbh.
[2:37:04] yrvengalied: and the wealthiest i think
[2:37:06] ItsBatsy: @ItsBatsy Its missing a lot of the core features im used to on twitch, which to be fair most of those come from ffz but yeah tis missing a lot of features
[2:37:12] Freezetrap: There's a Mr Beast burger shop that opened up right near me :O
[2:37:14] Sluggs_: mrbeast is the biggest youtuber now
[2:37:15] effed_up: does he have a pop up burger joint?
[2:37:17] titanodin: see i am not a youtube guy
[2:37:18] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: yeah Mr beast is the expert at working the youtube algorithm
[2:37:19] NocturnalLogic: yeah, that dude is swimming in money

[2:37:44] Reckless_Rob: I dont really care about whales and their chatrooms are trash
[2:37:54] SZebra: They were triggering Hellmuth though, which is always good for a laugh
[2:37:55] yrvengalied: i think he was in the Top 10 highest revenued YTber back in 2021
[2:37:56] Darkaros: PepegaCard
[2:37:58] Droigan: He also went into bitcoin really early he said in a podcast, so he is very well off.
[2:38:00] yrvengalied: he ranked 4th i think
[2:38:01] OuroborosChemist: biggest at 50mil per year is still very poor vs actually rich ppl
[2:38:04] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: it's fun to watch people deprint money
[2:38:05] Tronix_604: actually, mizkifs and moistcriticals poker stream was super entertaining
[2:38:26] ReginaldXIV: Actually
[2:38:29] ThemDemo: Mjolnir looks good back there

[2:40:12] Velrun: Have started watching The MCU Crew from episode 1. I am up to episode 12 (Loki ep3). I am amazed how much you guys got exactly right!! @itmeJP

[2:41:32] afreak10: square acting weird
[2:41:42] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: I guess square enix wanted to get rid of their debt
[2:41:43] Reckless_Rob: lmal, sounds good
[2:41:48] ThemDemo: Their margins are the big reason why the number was so low, SE mismanaged the fuck out of them
[2:41:58] SZebra: Have there been any games developed and released wholly under Embracer ownership yet, or is it too soon?
[2:42:01] nimrickz: looks like they are prob going to be bought out
[2:42:06] GameOnlyNoTalk: @Siggenlh true but the house gets some of the cut in a tourney, but it was a cash game.
[2:42:06] JustPete__: They paid 3 billion for a board game and ttrpg company, 300 million for Tomb Raider and Deus Ex. Crazy
[2:42:20] prfella: @zerohour_88 they released a statement saying they sold so they can invest in blockchaib

[2:43:23] bakavic: from a business perspective, its understandable why they sold off eidos and crystal dynamics

[2:43:32] stopthecarnival: I just missed the sweet, sultry sounds of your voice JP

[2:44:02] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: There are some really good text to speech out there
[2:44:02] SZebra: Thing is, Square can no longer hide behind their Western IPs/Studios when they have bad financial results.
[2:44:07] Reckless_Rob: @Foozzie o.O

[2:44:41] bakavic: @SZebra if you look at their latest financial papers, the only studios not doing well were the ones recently sold off
[2:44:59] yrvengalied: but am sure once it launches it will be news
[2:45:02] SMARTEST_MAN_IN_THE_WORLD: yeah exactly their japanese studios are doing well
[2:45:05] ReginaldXIV: I think the issue was that the profit margins were very low despite the games doing well. SE couldn't maintain operational costs
[2:45:20] zerohour_88: @bakavic and SE's big main IP prints money too LUL
[2:45:22] yrvengalied: probably will hit in the 10+ mil with in a couple of weeks
[2:45:24] bakavic: eido's 2021 profit margin was what, .62%?
[2:45:32] Tronix_604: maybe need new head Kappa
[2:45:34] Aisling_Evergarden: If you want a new mixer, I heard Microsoft has one they dont need

[2:45:56] HereForPizza: PauseChamp
[2:45:57] SZebra: @bakavic True, but Eidos/CD have often been the whipping boy when they've had bad years. Perhaps due to Square's entirely unrealistic expectations and requirements.
