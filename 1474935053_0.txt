[0:23:51] Menion01: To become a pilot, that means the candidate's vision can be no worse than 20/70 (correctable with glasses to 20/20) in each eye.
[0:23:52] NPSJason: air force innit? @itmeJP
[0:23:58] iilu: It's probably going to the channel islands to see Sips

[1:00:47] itsJprof: @Nashfanfl13 he's playing the elden ring of welding, where he doesn't summon
[1:00:54] Heisuisui: cheating!
[1:00:54] NPSJason: welding done wrong is actually dangerous so it's fine to be brutal LUL
[1:00:56] Nashfanfl13: lol
[1:00:59] OuroborosChemist: its just dropping the disliked frames
[1:01:03] yrvengalied: so he is reducing the flashing part
[1:01:05] shadowoflight_: wait you mean it wasn't obvious the video was edited?
[1:01:09] countmarcula: so he's just cutting the tacs closer together 🤷
[1:01:10] AinzN: ReginaldXIV you taking notes on how to edit JP's welding videos now?
[1:01:19] m3rcer: ah you edit out the flash to fake thats its a cold weld
[1:01:24] countmarcula: 5Head

[1:01:43] ceLaguna: errrrrr....
[1:01:47] Yorolek: me neither
[1:01:57] SpaceDive: just because of the edit yea
[1:02:01] BlueSapphyre: yeah. using editing magic.
[1:02:03] OnePunchMac: yep
[1:02:03] yrvengalied: probably
[1:02:03] MrDigitalCypher: no its missinformation. Those welds are not good welds @itmeJP
[1:02:03] Mrshilka: making itlook like a type of welding that does not exsist
[1:02:04] m3rcer: the different type of welding doesnt work i think is the problem
[1:02:04] 00oniking00: yep
[1:02:05] Norrak1: Pretty much
[1:02:05] SixPointFive: Basically, it seems so
[1:02:07] raptorscream: @itmeJP i't s fake type of welding, you can't weld like that at all
[1:02:07] LiteralZero: @itmeJP I THINK he's sped the weld up to make it look like its as good as other welds
[1:02:09] ReginaldXIV: Madge
[1:02:09] iamjustacow: the start and stop welding method is what he was saying I think
[1:02:09] SilvaeAmo: Pretty much I think
[1:02:09] Norrak1: and probably stealing views
[1:02:09] ApathyOwl: misinformation of how to weld I guess
[1:02:10] ZcottD: hes mad they do cheap welding that doesnt hold up and advertise it
[1:02:10] 00oniking00: 100% on point LUL
[1:02:11] yrvengalied: and misinformation too
[1:02:12] WDForty: @itmeJP if someone tries to do what the fake video shows, someone will try to do it like that and the weld will fail and maybe hurt someone
[1:02:12] zapH2O: he's upset because it's a welding that doesn't actually weld properly
[1:02:14] sack02: people editing welding to make a fake technique
[1:02:14] ThemDemo: People making up a new process that does not exist
[1:02:15] MrDigitalCypher: its misleading
[1:02:15] Lutcha81: i guess he is upset they cut it so it looks like they "invented" a 5th style ?
[1:02:16] Dasutin23: if someone mimicked the edit for real, it would result in a wak weld
[1:02:18] yammosk5: people are calling it a technique when it is just editing
[1:02:18] Yarmus: shitty weld sold as awesome weld
[1:02:19] Dasutin23: weak*
[1:02:19] shumbody0: people keep sending him vids about it
[1:02:20] itsJprof: I think it looks fancy but it doesn't actually hold stuff together
[1:02:22] countmarcula: yeah they're effectively speeding up the edit to make it look quick and easy
[1:02:23] Mrshilka: if you follow the video you gonna make a weld that fails
[1:02:27] nightsreach: the ype of welding is also a problem, not lack of skill
[1:02:27] Archangel3003: I think it's likely that if people try to copy that and then end up injuring themselves or damaging something because it didn't actually work
[1:02:27] breadgravy: yeah, it's basically like those fake lifehacks that get popular
[1:02:27] raptorscream: @itmeJP VIEWS !!!
[1:02:28] Sluggs_: views
[1:02:28] Gyranthir: they're deleting the flash. and doing something skill-less, and makign the cut look good/fancy.
[1:02:28] SixPointFive: For views?
[1:02:28] iamjustacow: fake internet points
[1:02:30] shadowoflight_: it's misrepresenting a ba weld for something taht doesn't exist

[1:02:30] Norrak1: Views?
[1:02:30] zerohour_88: cause it looks good on video
[1:02:30] Miros__: It's selling a "cookless cheesecake" that omits the bake time from the video

[1:02:58] AinzN: Time to nominate Welding for JP's community day NODDERS
[1:02:59] Crafteroon: He's upset about the Yasuo compilation that deleted the 50 or so games of complete feed on Yasuo's part to show the 2 quadra kill moments.

[2:13:29] GrievAY: His clear is super fast from lvl 1 and just becomes faster @itmejp
[2:13:56] BaosilisK: bot is doing good at least
[2:14:04] AlphaMetal: In this Elo no one is good at farming so you can just lock in karthus and farm your little heart out and hopefully your team doesn’t chain feed.
[2:14:51] GrievAY: Plus he has a global ult that will hurt more the longer the game lasts
[2:15:03] RoboticBiotic777: doesn't jungle item decrease the gold you get from minions? so even if he is clearing actual waves, it isn't actually giving him that much extra gold.
[2:15:21] RoboticBiotic777: of course if the farm is from jungle then yeah. he has a lotta gold. haha
[2:16:20] AsocialSociologist: LUL

[2:33:40] NiloxofAsgard: you have to right AinzN stripFufu
[2:33:41] Craylith: As somebody who doesn´t play League how do players usually decide who to ban? The strongest characters? The direct counters against their own character?
[2:33:45] Strivus: @itmeJP Have you heard of Shaco's law? Shaco on your team? Feeding idiot. Enemy Shaco? Fakers alt
[2:33:56] AinzN: NiloxofAsgard yes! NODDERS
[2:33:59] ProxyClouds: So sad I can’t bet in those :( would have been fun. Guess it’s an EU thing?
[2:34:06] EclNano: @Craylith the heros you dont like
[2:34:15] Tnobuhiko: @Craylith usually both, if something is too op they usually ban it, or if something is too strong of a counter
[2:34:18] CastIronJake: @AinzN WE thank you for your service though haha
[2:34:39] AinzN: CastIronJake I just want to remove an emote! ijpSAD
[2:34:40] NiloxofAsgard: welp my channel points are gone Sadge this is shaping up to be a good dub for Jp unless his teams trolls

[2:35:00] Craylith: @Craylith I see. Thanks. for the info.
[2:35:02] ZeroDjinn: tanky kat has become meta is why JP
[2:35:03] Cixah: !poe
[2:35:03] itmeBOT: Path of Exile's new league is hitting May 13, and JP will probably be playing a lot of it this season! He played last season completely offstream and enjoyed the new mapping endgame a lot even though the league and its mechanics weren't that appealing over Elden Ring.
[2:35:08] ZeroDjinn: on hit dmg is huge
[2:35:21] Cixah: kats popular and she got a bit of a base damage buff
[2:35:24] CastIronJake: Main Character syndrome?
[2:35:32] AinzN: ProxyClouds you have a channel prediction badge so you have bet?
[2:35:34] aLeafGuy: 3 tanks is gonna be tough late game
[2:35:49] ZeroDjinn: if she goes the meta kat build she'll melt tanks
[2:35:50] ZanninAkkusu: Vaynespotting time!
[2:35:54] Tnobuhiko: vayne vs tris is a tough matchup for vayne
[2:36:09] zerohour_88: match of the hypercarries
[2:36:09] sack02: kat seems like a hard swain counter if she's good
[2:36:29] ProxyClouds: @AinzN I have the badge but can only select yes or no, not bet on the answer
[2:36:34] Tnobuhiko: @sack02 is there anything that does not counter swain?
[2:36:45] Shoaron: Hmm
[2:36:47] InternetPlumber: thats the bald sneaking in jp
[2:36:53] PangieV: lookin fresh with the new dew JP HypeCool

[2:37:09] Cixah: it looks deep yea
[2:37:12] InternetPlumber: thats how it started with me
[2:37:13] AinzN: ProxyClouds weird. Where are you from if you don't mind saying? I knew a few countries can't bet due to gambling laws
[2:37:24] space_koara: im going bol i will shave my soon
[2:37:29] zerohour_88: I had a barber hide my hairline quite well, but the style didn't vibe with me

[2:38:23] Silver_Sol_x: were you trying to bet a custom amount @ProxyClouds?

[2:44:26] Gorn_Vernaleer: @UnboundSouls really? I did it yesterday, it was only like 2 clicks.
[2:44:29] Gat0rCh0mp: kat really just needed to auto attack that minion 2x
[2:44:42] UnboundSouls: i had a make a microsoft account and then it said it didnt work

[2:46:40] The_Magician: re-worked Swain feels strong
[2:46:52] Shiny_Cony_: @itmeJP do you play with anything like u.gg?
[2:47:04] AinzN: Getting flashbacks of that Twitch who was obsessed with dragon the other day
[2:47:08] k0jak: !app
[2:47:08] itmeBOT: JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay).
[2:47:16] k0jak: ijpHMM
[2:47:21] AinzN: Shiny_Cony_ he uses poro
[2:47:26] Shiny_Cony_: @k0jak lol thanks
[2:47:28] moist_heinous: that was Abit forced by kat
[2:47:30] k0jak: he uses porofessor now
[2:47:35] Garrett_Redden: There's only been angles bot and it's never when you are on that side of the map
[2:48:12] k0jak: !makecommand app JP has used u.gg and Porofessor, thinks both of them are equally alright-ish, and currently uses Porofessor.
[2:48:13] itmeBOT: !app CHANGED. It used to be "JP uses U.GG as his in-game League of Legends helper app. He bought a year of premium (...and thinks it's ultimately just okay)." - To revert issue !revert app

[2:52:47] zerohour_88: considering how bot went, it went downhill fast
[2:52:59] AlphaMetal: Your katarina is a potato and vayne can’t do anything. It’s rough.
[2:53:21] AinzN: Yeah since you hit high Silver the games have been weird
[2:53:27] Garrett_Redden: can't carry but I feel bad for him. Seems like his cho just played super passive and didn't know the match up enough to adjust
[2:53:34] Garrett_Redden: in regards to urgot
[2:53:56] Shoaron: healing in this game can be ijpSUFFER sometimes
[2:53:57] Kinjimax: how we doing in league today

[2:58:43] Birgerz: always good to cover it but its sadge to not be able to see it
[2:58:48] Garrett_Redden: There's an overlay you can use that still shows your lane vision and stuff so it's not total darkness. if you think that's enough
[2:58:50] Birgerz: kinda like covered chat in ff
[2:59:08] Reijm11: Better games then yesterday?

[2:59:36] Gat0rCh0mp: At least since you are jg w/ map hidden we at least know whats up as viewers, when you watch a bot laner or something that hides map its hard to tell whats going on with the game sometimes
[2:59:46] Jnuggernaught: What happened to yesterdays VOD? It was removed while i watching it.
[3:00:07] Darkaros: !vods2
[3:00:07] itmeBOT: PSA: Twitch is automatically unpublishing VODs, and we must manually edit/highlight them after checking if there's DMCA content that prompted Twitch to unpublish it in the first place. It may be a few hours after the end of a broadcast before we can reupload them. YouTube uploads will continue at usual pace.

[3:06:27] Gorn_Vernaleer: I just realize, that I look at the map a lot usually... Sadge
[3:06:36] Rawrsong: Ashe is taking a smoke break PepeHands
[3:06:36] OuroborosChemist: smoking weed or poppies?

[3:07:18] Gyranthir: JNCOs?
[3:07:22] Darkaros: NODDERS It's true, JP smoked the meats during a LoL game once
[3:07:35] moist_heinous: jenkums yep I looked it up. probably
[3:07:46] Archangel3003: Worst thing about the way vods are now, is that if I leave the stream before it's finished, then come back to watch the end of it the next day, it doesn't put me back to the point I left and I have to guess where I was.
[3:08:57] zymioi: is it me or is the map bug
[3:09:05] sack02: its an overlay
[3:09:05] Banana25: overlay
[3:09:06] OhTenGeneral: It's an anti-ghosting thing
[3:09:10] Rawrsong: There's an overlay to block snipers
[3:09:14] zymioi: oh okay
[3:09:18] GrievAY: @zymioi overlay not lined up
[3:09:35] zymioi: i thought i random thought i was high there lol

[3:11:21] AinzN: Can't do rotations if you don't avoid the circles
[3:11:27] demigod791: no like actually who cares if you do your rotation perfectly its all about uptime
[3:11:34] OuroborosChemist: more uptime so stand in fire that only dmg you a bit but doesnt kill you
[3:11:40] Birgerz: yeah a lot of people have the correct rotation but wait half a second between each GCD so they have awful tho
[3:11:42] KerwinBJones: rotations in FFXIV are so much more brain than reflexes... some of the people who struggle i wonder
[3:11:48] ceLaguna: Always orange parse on Soraka
[3:11:49] demigod791: mind you im a lil greedy shit in XIV
[3:12:26] AinzN: If I cared about rotations in FFXIV I wouldn't main DNC
[3:12:33] Birgerz: @OuroborosChemist and then savage gives you a damage down
[3:12:46] ceLaguna: @AinzN you rotate with your head on the keyboard with DNC
[3:13:10] Banana25: monkaS

[3:14:29] sack02: might be power farming for stacks too
[3:14:36] NiloxofAsgard: sucks ijpSAD some people really live off pooping on everyone around them ijpMAD
[3:14:39] Garrett_Redden: Cho doesn't gank a lot early. Usually he walks out of jungle at like lvl 8 big as shit
[3:14:46] AinzN: Birgerz I'm just upset that they nerfed DNC damage is all ijpSAD
[3:14:57] Rawrsong: Cho can't really gank much early so he lives in the jungle
