[1:04:15] FreshBrew: i like these houses just to count all the bathrooms they have. like whenever theres extra space theres another bathroom
[1:04:21] GraveSalad: 42 mil in Utah, so rich mormons?
[1:04:21] Kalvixish: The scenery is gorgeous, the house itself... not so much
[1:04:23] JBfromAccounting: heated driveways Im guessing
[1:04:23] FaceMcShooty: @itmeJP have u seen the video of the biggest most expensive house in the world? it is nuts xD
[1:04:28] Thrishmal: Seems a bit too close to the other mansions
[1:04:29] itsClavi: Looks like a prison with the tower on the outside
[1:04:37] Jay_rb: Ollie would fuck that place up EZ
[1:04:39] BeardedBeck: This house will probably look pretty good in a few years, when the copper oxidized
[1:04:44] Puretaz: Does he think someone will view this video and be like ima buy that
[1:04:48] jeffhunter12: uhhhh
[1:04:49] countmarcula: what channel is this?

[1:04:58] Zeltoo: looks a bit like a prison
[1:04:59] BeardedBeck: @countmarcula Enes yilmares
[1:04:59] SZebra: Wasn't this the setting for the assault sequence in Inception?
[1:05:02] itsClavi: Shrek ears
[1:05:05] ReginaldXIV: Target spotted
[1:05:05] Zeltoo: outside anyway, with that tower thing
[1:05:06] zymioi: i feel like this house being in a movie
[1:05:07] Kalvixish: Thats the wall he forgot to wipe down 1 season when he left, and now its just to hard to clean up
[1:05:07] JBfromAccounting: @facemcshooty the developer had to file for bankruptcy and sold for way less than what they were saying it was worth lok
[1:05:08] Reijm11: I think i killed someone here in Hitman 3
[1:05:08] Saunt: thought it was a CGI house for a sec
[1:05:09] NoorElBahrain: @Zeltoo I can see that
[1:05:10] yrvengalied: this looks sick
[1:05:13] Jay_rb: Looks like a Call of Duty map
[1:05:13] JeedanJune: that should lower the value by a couple million KEKW
[1:05:24] Crafteroon: Someone saw the snow fortress from Inception, and was like "I could build that".
[1:05:31] Goobbl: Goobbl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months!

[1:05:55] FreshBrew: oh the tower is meant to keep out the riffraff, Nice!
[1:05:55] jeffhunter12: dont call it the colony
[1:06:00] SZebra: pop-up machine guns?
[1:06:04] TinyTal: It looks like a cult compound...
[1:06:11] NPSJason: The Colony is 100% a cult town
[1:06:14] kasded: YEP
[1:06:15] Cygnatus: that's not a house, that's a whole zip code
[1:06:15] ReginaldXIV: Probably heated
[1:06:17] Mujona: They are normally heated
[1:06:18] Kaleith: it's foam ijpNODDERS
[1:06:21] GraveSalad: dude, just imagine how many people you could house instead of just 1 rich asshole making a prestige statement
[1:06:23] SZebra: Fake snow?
[1:06:24] countmarcula: The Colony? A little on the nose guys, no? KEKW
[1:06:31] Rambler: probably heated yeah
[1:06:37] Kalvixish: I mean I'd guess heated, and somebody is paid to clean it every single day
[1:06:39] Kaleith: or maybe it's just cocaine
[1:06:40] its__fil: Ah yes valet parking
[1:06:42] acturio01: probably the snow is actually cocaine
[1:06:46] OmegaCrits: lol look at that pile of snow
[1:06:47] JBfromAccounting: @itmejp for 42m they ain't gonna let mother nature be an issue lol
[1:06:47] SZebra: @countmarcula #notacult
[1:06:49] Calum_: @itmeJP He also has a 2nd channel called 'Enes Plus' where he tours stranger houses like floating homes and doomsday bunkers.
[1:06:55] FreshBrew: thats what every house looks like in april in canada. snow on the grass but all the roads are clear
[1:06:56] sage40k: this place prolly cost more than my hometown

[1:07:02] EvoCaliber: ijpNODDERS
[1:07:02] Hiei121: MmmHmm

[1:07:04] CryptidLurks: NODDERS Surely it's the Hooker Door
[1:07:07] yrvengalied: but where is will smith
[1:07:09] buzzkillington_: Yes but you gotta pay extra for it
[1:07:09] Saunt: the backdoor for the hookers?
[1:07:12] zymioi: ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS ijpTOTSUGEKI
[1:07:12] AzamaraSehki: Of course, you don't want them dirtying up the normal entrance
[1:07:12] CheekierNando: Heated concrete and sidewalks does not work. They melted snow refreezes into ice if its not naturally banked off.
[1:07:12] Senpai_Eeyore: its sad cause its a really cool house but yeah, think of the money you could use for other things...
[1:07:13] BeardedBeck: Fast access to food through uber
[1:07:14] Rambler: zekeFLIRT
[1:07:16] shibbsyy: Ain't nobody comin' over. NOPERS
[1:07:18] Joitch: KEKW
[1:07:24] Truder2k: this is why we can't have nice things... just pissing away energy to heat concrete outside
[1:07:26] FreshBrew: but you can see the massive snow pile where the plow piled it all
[1:07:26] Kalvixish: "theres a special dungeon as well when you get to rough with the hookers"
[1:07:28] CheekierNando: Oh they have irrigation in the concrete
[1:07:31] MesquiteBear: Lol
[1:07:33] Thrishmal: Escorts, JP, sheesh
[1:07:38] perfidy0255: Can't let the plebs walk in the same way as them peoples.
[1:07:39] TinyTal: @itmeJP Well you don't just take them in the main entrance...
[1:07:43] Sprengkobold: the streamer analogue would be the doordash door
[1:07:50] CryptidLurks: " uh uh, that's the hooker door." NOPERS
[1:07:55] FreshBrew: show us the car lifts
[1:08:08] Thrishmal: Zombies will fall right over that wall
[1:08:10] NPSJason: also doubles as a door to drag the bodies out of
[1:08:12] SZebra: Not hookers, 'contractors with negotiable virtue'.
[1:08:13] Kalvixish: Agree to disagree, I prefer stone to copper
[1:08:20] JBfromAccounting: Jesus Christ... that's so much copper for a god damned retaining wall
[1:08:22] JeedanJune: so great LUL
[1:08:23] MesquiteBear: That’s dum expensive
[1:08:25] KatjeMauw: copper petina = green dont it, thats just copper \
[1:08:25] iilu: Yeah, not into it
[1:08:28] Steel_Faith: KKona nice wall
[1:08:29] Kalvixish: Plus how much are they paying to stop that copper turning green?
[1:08:29] TaylolasTV: he reminds me of mr.stones
[1:08:29] Crafteroon: copper and timeless should not be used in the same sentence.
[1:08:29] Zeltoo: omagine when the sun hits that copper
[1:08:31] Lutcha81: wont that copper be green very fast
[1:08:37] boxofpants: im just thinking of people that strip copper out of old buildings having a field day
[1:08:39] JBfromAccounting: a 2nd hooker door
[1:08:40] Azegoroth: That's gonna need a lot of work with all that copper, because copper becomes green if it becomes oxidized
[1:08:42] zymioi: this is jeff bezos house ijpKEK ijpKEK
[1:08:43] Kalvixish: I mean it must cost them a fortune to stop it oxidising and going green
[1:08:44] GraveSalad: so how much do you have to spend to not make the walls go "statue of liberty" on you?
[1:08:48] sneakypooo: @Lutcha81 They can afford slaves to polish it
[1:08:49] JeedanJune: waste of water
[1:08:51] NPSJason: @Lutcha81 not when you have 17 people to clean it 24/7
[1:08:55] Korhazen: its probably not real copper
[1:09:00] CryptidLurks: GIant fuzzy couch
[1:09:02] its__fil: @Lutcha81 That's how you know it's time to buiy some more HahaThink
[1:09:03] perfidy0255: @Lutcha81 I was gonna say the same thing. It's going to oxydize.
[1:09:05] generalcatburd: We've strayed too far from frank lloyd wright
[1:09:05] Jay_rb: does a Giant live there?
[1:09:06] TinyTal: "And here is the fire hose, for when the hookers need to go home."
[1:09:08] Kalvixish: Christ, is this proof finally Bigfoot exists? he only visits rich people
[1:09:10] legofreak59: why do you need a massive door like that?
[1:09:13] BeardedBeck: @Korhazen its so expensive, it probably is
[1:09:13] NPSJason: @Korhazen true, it's likely gold painted to look like copper NODDERS
[1:09:16] SZebra: Copper is probably treated with a sealant, or it's an alloy.
[1:09:18] NoorElBahrain: gym?! NOPERS I don't want to exercise
[1:09:26] Lutcha81: i accept the slave answer the my copper question
[1:09:26] GraveSalad: @legofreak59 in case Shaq comes over
[1:09:26] DaRandalizer: not really in the front the front door
[1:09:37] Kalvixish: it doesn't look gorgeous, it looks like they used the scrap materials they had spare
[1:09:39] Sprengkobold: who tf is "bronze inlaid floor" rich
[1:09:41] Senpai_Eeyore: I do like that society really has just started to look at these videos in a more critical light rather than glorifying it like we did in the 90s and 00s
[1:09:43] hawk_moth: Why does this guy give me con artist vibes?
[1:09:44] CryptidLurks: Big door, to load in their piano if need be.
[1:09:55] BobbiTheDragon: who owns that house?
[1:09:58] Stormmaggeddon: those windows are so fucking expensive
[1:09:59] BurdTheWurd: What I like to call wasted space

[1:10:06] SZebra: KEKW
[1:10:09] Cygnatus: D:
[1:10:09] JeedanJune: i'd be disappointed with the echo for that money
[1:10:16] lzrdou: all these super expensive mansions look so soulless its scary
[1:10:16] itsClavi: If I was a millionare, I wouldn't have that big of a house.
[1:10:17] JBfromAccounting: I don't think he's even an agent now, he just does YouTube for the most part
[1:10:17] CryptidLurks: KEKW So unnecessary
[1:10:19] jeffhunter12: woooow
[1:10:25] NoorElBahrain: house isn't for me
[1:10:25] jeffhunter12: that  looks really nice
[1:10:27] lord_baggabutts: bruh that water bill tho
[1:10:30] Thrishmal: Nice of him to let the camera guy talk, lol
[1:10:32] yrvengalied: LUL
[1:10:33] Crafteroon: so once you break them....
[1:10:38] its__fil: There's always a big staircase wit hsome unique bullshit in the middle
[1:10:55] NPSJason: the difference between a low end and high end realtor is, they describe the same house but one is honest
[1:10:57] thrillhouse451: removalbe mirror
[1:10:58] Jay_rb: Hookers coke room NODDERS
[1:10:58] AinzN: I have thought a lot about the house I would make if I had millions and I would jsut buy a tiny cottage
[1:11:02] Stormmaggeddon: weird mirror
[1:11:02] EvoCaliber: LUL
[1:11:04] Bored_Ming: Show the HVAC system
[1:11:05] Kalvixish: I never get homes like this as unless you have like 20 people visiting non stop it'd feel so empty
[1:11:05] Nemo_wolf: with those stone walls, that is not a small child friendly home.
[1:11:07] Miros__: that mirror is fucking hideous
[1:11:07] Thrishmal: I kinda dig that
[1:11:09] Redvelvet84: it sucks that they cant be critical of anything in these videos, or they lose their source of income
[1:11:09] FreshBrew: i really enjoy a house with nothing but features to trip and fall on and maybe never wake up from the impact
[1:11:12] CryptidLurks: Ah yes, the coke room right behind the Hooker door. stalalaNotes
[1:11:13] Sprengkobold: the inability to never get cleaned
[1:11:14] JeedanJune: eh lol
[1:11:17] iilu: Yeah, this really isn't my style, far too flashy. I'm with you AinzN
[1:11:17] NoorElBahrain: nice wall

[1:11:24] NoorElBahrain: mirror is creepy
[1:11:25] Senpai_Eeyore: that looks like an alien...
[1:11:27] Kersenka: When a guy says everything in the house is absolutely amazing you know you cannot trust a word he says
[1:11:28] PangieV: Dr. Seuss lighting right there
[1:11:29] generalcatburd: man this house would suck to do acid aT
[1:11:29] jeffhunter12: terrible mirror

[1:12:22] generalcatburd: maybe we can spot the fishbowl for the keys
[1:12:23] ThemDemo: Oh my god
[1:12:26] Kalvixish: look how he avoids touching the fabric
[1:12:30] AinzN: @iilu all I need is a small place that allows me to have all my current tech and really fast internet
[1:12:32] Pistollero1: "Couch"
[1:12:35] espi: sounds expenive
[1:12:35] TheCoskii: some kinda ancient tree chunk likely.
[1:12:36] Kalvixish: he knows full well that fabric is far crispier to the touch than it should be
[1:12:38] Zaalri: they burn the outside of the wood
[1:12:39] Sprengkobold: it translates to rich people nonsense

[1:13:23] espi: the snack
[1:13:26] NoorElBahrain: office is in the kitchen?
[1:13:29] Kalvixish: that is where you double team somebodyu
[1:13:31] STNbond: thats for the chef
[1:13:31] SZebra: One blacklight and you could see this compound from orbit at night.

[1:13:37] Reijm11: @NoorElBahrain butler office

[1:13:44] iilu: @AinzN Yep, I'd just like a little wildlife haven somewhere
[1:13:48] Kalvixish: this entire house is designed purely for orgies

[1:13:55] ToeKnee147: there is that weird matte blue again
[1:13:59] Crafteroon: not sure about the blue though.
[1:14:03] shibbsyy: A great kitchen for making a nice grilled cheese.
[1:14:03] AzamaraSehki: @Kalvixish nekomi2Gasm
[1:14:12] Truder2k: the kitchen actually looks like it is useful instead of just ostentatious

[1:14:18] Redvelvet84: thats more a business kitchen than a home kitchen

[1:14:54] espi: they put the wood in the wrong direction NotLikeThis
[1:14:55] Zaalri: ones hot and ones cold
[1:14:58] rowanislay: @GraveSalad because you pay for a private chef to cook for your friends in this huge kitchen, it needs to look nice.
[1:15:01] BeardedBeck: Why do you need the door to the bedroom?
