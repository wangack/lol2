[0:55:14] Munetani_NJimha: Baseball OMEGALUL
[0:55:15] SaltyAsChuck: @itmeJP we were always taught if you turn your shoulders toward second instead of outside.. you go back to the bag if you're staying
[0:55:15] El_Zilcho22: nothing. shouldn't have been called out
[0:55:21] lordofthecheese: he wasnt looking at the ball, he was looking at the coach
[0:55:23] Excalibur_Z: if he turned clockwise he would have been fine
[0:55:23] kin_gdom: yeah, turn right instead of left
[0:55:29] Qvdv: bobbithedragon you could be an umpire then
[0:55:32] Ruxpen: Terrible call
[0:55:33] SaltyAsChuck: I think it's a stupid call for professionals

[0:56:06] Lutcha81: oops caps
[0:56:10] InternetPlumber: "i'll see myself out"

[0:57:11] Shiny_Cony_: Baseball has so many weird mannerisms like that haha

[1:22:27] Imagine42: @Shin_gx I mean you're not wrong, that's why I'm saying that I hope that they fix some of that stuff in the expansion

[1:24:10] RoniBranco: STO was meh, CoH was good compared to what we have at the time
[1:24:14] MythGameStream: Champions did the same thing to me.  $200 for life time sub then went F2P.

[1:25:02] Shin_gx: @Imagine42 if it's more of the same with a couple QoL stuff as it looks like to be, i think you have more chances winning the lottery tbh. Concept of the game was great and the characters you play were cool but the rest was such a clusterfuck, it was like anthem again but slightly less broken
[1:25:05] WaystedMined: Strange that in many ways the CoH character creator is still the gold standard....
[1:25:06] MTLSnowman: Muffnar, I heard of them but friends moved on to other games and got out of the MMO life

[2:50:54] Puretaz: how long does it take to get 7 levels in league
[2:50:56] Mondo_Gibbs: "Yea, you should play more Victor, you need that staff to prop up your horrendous plays" or could have gone with "You should play Shaco, atleast that you might be funny" for that Victor player

[4:14:28] bobphrapples: oh shit bot comeback
[4:14:29] k0jak: seems fine to me
[4:14:32] freaker286: @The_Faceless_Void I mean, I wouldnt consider the person that said that a friend, but not sure about ban worthy
[4:14:51] SergeantFlare: @The_Faceless_Void nah there's a list of key words that an auto mod bot flags
[4:14:55] epicshoo: monkaS
[4:14:55] Direwolf45: my friend got banned for the name he used for a couple years
[4:15:11] The_Faceless_Void: Well i got A FUICKING PERMA FROM THAT JOKE
[4:15:22] freaker286: I mean, lv 4 pillar makes sense when all lanes are inting and you cannot gank them
[4:15:24] Direwolf45: @The_Faceless_Void atpFeelsBeardMan
[4:15:35] Spaltzer: @The_Faceless_Void Your very first punishment ever on your account was a permanent ban?
[4:15:47] The_Faceless_Void: @Spaltzer my first EVER was a 3 day chat ban
[4:15:52] The_Faceless_Void: this is ONLY 2
[4:16:08] Direwolf45: HOLD
[4:16:09] Spaltzer: Typically, they do escalating punishments, starting with chat restrictions. I'm surprised that you got permanently banned on your very first offence!
[4:16:09] aethybryr: not yet not yet
[4:16:10] bobphrapples: locked screen player
[4:16:12] botsumoto: LUL
[4:16:12] epicshoo: ijpPRAY
[4:16:14] The_Faceless_Void: @Spaltzer ive been playing since season 1 and never had issues until this season
[4:16:18] Dieelon: viktor ran out of auto attacks
[4:16:19] SlythaCrazy37: no mana cant auto attack twice 2 help u kill YEP
[4:16:36] freaker286: "victory, if you unlock your camera you might win one in 8 games"
[4:16:44] freaker286: victor*
[4:16:51] The_Faceless_Void: @Spaltzer gonna appeal it and I asked for a perma chat ban cause I cant deal with silver teammates even after saying GJ and NJ and keep it up you guys rock
[4:16:51] Spaltzer: @The_Faceless_Void Did you agree to the Summoner's Code when you created your account?
[4:17:15] The_Faceless_Void: @Spaltzer if tyler 1 can be unbanned for his shit i should be as well
[4:17:31] Spaltzer: @The_Faceless_Void But Tyler1 is actually a somebody. Aren't you a low-ranked nobody?
[4:17:32] bobphrapples: synergy
[4:17:33] freaker286: That pillar is godly
[4:17:36] SlythaCrazy37: thank godu  got that
[4:18:00] The_Faceless_Void: @Spaltzer I dont think tyler ahd the pulling power he had back then as he does now
[4:18:18] bobphrapples: nasus wants you to be top, mid, and bot at the same time, can you work on that kthxbye
[4:18:28] AnnieJella: @The_Faceless_Void That doesnt even seem worthy of a chat restriction even
[4:18:38] Spaltzer: @The_Faceless_Void Would you say you and Tyler1 have comparable amount of clout for when he got unbanned? Or would you say he has significantly more clout than you?
[4:18:44] SergeantFlare: they let MF go???
[4:18:55] Airdus: tell him that as far as man machine goes for viktor, he's probably the son of a printer
[4:18:56] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW what was that dive
[4:19:09] Spaltzer: @AndiFjell It wasn't his first offence, and there's always two sides to a story. Of course this person was toxic prior to this and this is simply an escalating situation of poor behaviour
[4:19:19] cloudaeris1: that jarven was bold
[4:19:23] AnnieJella: @Spaltzer oh i thought it was first
[4:19:24] ErikThe_Viking: It looks like that Victor was missing a Trundle in his life
[4:19:48] Rawrsong: I've seen that hentai
[4:19:52] Spaltzer: @AndiFjell Nope, he was banned from chat for three days prior, and that's all he's telling us. Likely more to the story than the "victim" admits
[4:20:04] The_Faceless_Void: @AndiFjell my first chat ban was after having a literal bot laning support on my team and telling them to I hope they find love in life KEKW
[4:20:24] The_Faceless_Void: @Spaltzer I got chat banned for having a BOT support and shitting on them
[4:20:27] Spaltzer: Wouldn't it be a perfect world if we could believe every victim and all the stories they tell
[4:20:28] Buttzyy: lool this nasus big baby
