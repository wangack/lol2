[1:34:08] ZeroDjinn: evening all
[1:34:16] Kalvixish: his role in the main MCU is done, so he's an easy kill for sympathy
[1:34:17] ghostsofcarcosa: nebula likely lives I think
[1:34:19] WaystedMined: Both Thors

[1:35:45] garry_leonard: tea cup amumu be like "i thought you'd never drink tea"
[1:36:14] NoorElBahrain: @Kalvixish both exist at the same time in the comics I don't see why they can't in the films
[1:36:26] garry_leonard: lol no "i thought you'd never pick me" Just playing with words.
[1:36:31] Kalvixish: @NoorElBahrain thats comics, in the films it'd confused the general public
[1:36:37] Orsulamon: the porcelien skins remind me of beauty and the beast
[1:36:46] Kalvixish: @NoorElBahrain you need to remember the general public isn't smart, thats what modern Trek is still being made
[1:36:52] Kalvixish: why*
[1:36:53] swiftybean: @Kalvixish chris has a revitalized enjoyment of the role since ragnarok and has shown enthusiasm to play it for a while longer
[1:37:16] NoorElBahrain: @Kalvixish oh the reminds me Strange New Worlds is like old Star Trek and I love it!
[1:37:25] ghostsofcarcosa: @NoorElBahrain Oh seriously?
[1:37:28] zerohour_88: NODDERS
[1:37:47] NoorElBahrain: ghostsofcarcosa yeah 1 ep so far and I love it so hopefully it continues
[1:37:56] Kalvixish: @NoorElBahrain 0oooo0 I'll need to watch that, I've been slowly losing all hope and getting depressed over how new Trek has gone down the toilet
[1:37:57] NoorElBahrain: yeah old Star Trek vibe JP
[1:37:58] ghostsofcarcosa: @NoorElBahrain Hell yea I might actually watch it then!
[1:37:59] Nashfanfl13: I liked Strange new worlds pretty good but only 1 ep so far :)
[1:37:59] Sonatta: i gotta check out Strange New Worlds
[1:38:13] NoorElBahrain: Pike is now one of my fav. Captains
[1:38:17] Kalvixish: @NoorElBahrain it'd be nice to see people actually making sci-fi for people who care about the genre instead of idiots
[1:38:27] afreak10: episode 7 was trash
[1:38:28] ghostsofcarcosa: That's exciting Noor ty for the heads up
[1:38:29] Randomdude08: yes
[1:38:32] NoorElBahrain: @Kalvixish I hope so
[1:38:34] Tanaros: Is all of Halo out?
[1:38:40] NoorElBahrain: @ghostsofcarcosa enjoy ijpLOVE
[1:38:41] Merlin_Emrys: how is outer range?
[1:38:41] Kalvixish: Seriously Picard is such a huge pile of crap it makes me sad for the legacy of Trek
[1:38:48] ghostsofcarcosa: Also lower decks isn't awful of all the new star trek stuff its okay.
[1:39:00] Kalvixish: and STD (so bad they named it after sexual diseases) has completely collapsed in on itself
[1:39:11] ghostsofcarcosa: It's nice to just watch something and be done
[1:39:12] drunkencpt: oh yes
[1:39:15] SpecificallyVague: agree
[1:39:16] WaystedMined: You were given a story and it's complete
[1:39:21] kapjak: that and nope are both alien cowboy movies/shows. How did 2 come out at the same time
[1:39:23] Sonatta: no filler tv shows are great
[1:39:28] drunkencpt: Like chernobyl, fucking hell so good
[1:39:43] Kalvixish: I mean I'm still fine with something like TNG and DS9 where it's an ongoing thing, but not stupid "oh no end of season mega worry thing!"
[1:39:44] KokooGra: Is this music in-game?
[1:39:45] Shoaron: ye some TV shows go on way too long 'cough coughanime cough'
[1:39:46] NoorElBahrain: yeah the story is better pased. 24 ep series is full of filler

[1:39:55] NoorElBahrain: paced*
[1:39:56] Kalvixish: I actually enjoy weekly episodes that are seperate things
[1:39:57] ZeroDjinn: Q
[1:40:08] Kalvixish: I'm getting tired of every season being 1 huge story with no self contained episodes
[1:41:15] NoorElBahrain: @Kalvixish yeah Voyager has a series, seasonal, and smaller story arc + still have the episodic Star Trek feel to it
[1:41:39] Kalvixish: ok I lost a LOT of confidence in strange new worlds seeing that Kurtzman has written for it...
[1:41:50] Kalvixish: that guy is a complete and total idiot who hasn't watched and episode of Trek in his life
[1:41:55] The_Faceless_Void: zeri afk farming lane
[1:42:12] Kalvixish: Kurtzman has single handily destroyed Trek
[1:42:38] KokooGra: Hello? Is this music in-game?
[1:42:52] AinzN: Kokoo__ no this is a lofi playlist from YouTube
[1:43:04] AinzN: !song
[1:43:04] itmeBOT: The current song is: beats to relax/study to by lofi hip hop radio
[1:43:31] KokooGra: Thank you for answer @AinzN  @itmeJP
[1:43:46] Kalvixish: The best example of how dumb and simplified new Trek is, is season 2 of picard and how they treated Guinan... they make her own a bar in EVERY GAME CENTURY
[1:44:00] Kalvixish: my god in previous episodes of TNG we saw her rubbing shoulders with high society
[1:44:10] Kalvixish: but in Picard she just runs a bar in every single god damn century apparently
[1:44:19] Kalvixish: because she ran 10 forward so of course she only ever runs bars
[1:44:33] Kalvixish: and she was somehow younger in the 18th century than she was in the modern age
[1:44:38] DobbsjustDobbs: Kalv, it's gonna be ok
[1:44:55] Kalvixish: like... did they not watch enough to know that they met Guinan in the 18th century?
[1:45:02] Kalvixish: clearly not as they'd know she wasn't a 20 year old in those days
[1:45:05] NoorElBahrain: Well this one started out well. Hopefully it continues because I need good Star Trek
[1:45:16] Kalvixish: Same, I miss old Trek
[1:45:25] DobbsjustDobbs: good gank
[1:45:27] Truder2k: tell us how you really feel @Kalvixish LUL (jk... just funny that you're on a 5 minute monologue :D)
[1:45:44] jeffhunter12: thats really good
[1:45:47] Boonia: has Jp been getting stream sniped? I just noticed he has the map coverings
[1:45:53] Kalvixish: sorry :P I'm just a little drunk and have seen way to much old Trek combined with highlights of stupid stuff in new Trek
[1:46:01] maximal99334: Poor Amumu :(
[1:46:02] Feeos: I like Picard show, star trek: Michael Burnham is bad. New show haven't watched yet
[1:46:15] AinzN: Boonia there have been some games where people have come in afterwards and that
[1:46:17] jeffhunter12: @Boonia yaeh theres been some stream sniping recently
[1:46:19] Kalvixish: like how the Romulan Empire, the BIGGEST empire in our Galaxy, somehow collapses because of 1 supernova
[1:46:29] Kalvixish: even though a supernova takes 1000s or millions of years so they would 100% know it was happening
[1:46:56] Kalvixish: I mean why did the Romulans 100% rely on The federation? they have a huge empire, and why did the federation decide to be evil and leave them to die?
[1:47:12] jeffhunter12: was worried he was about to become a mummy snack there

[1:54:57] andreaslorozco: he just feared you in mid
[1:55:07] Kalvixish: The only difference is GM players play 8-12 hours a day every day

[1:56:47] Kalvixish: but ye fighting over objectives is when you are meant to fight
[1:57:39] ErikThe_Viking: Well you cant compare low elo league and competitive play where some games are around 1hour.
[1:57:43] TheXtractor: started playing league again today after not playing since dec 2020

[2:07:09] afreak10: so many losses
[2:07:10] TDS_Ezaor: why is he building shieldbow on zeri
[2:07:11] archinctp: I'm sure he used to play zeri before they ABSOLUTELY broke her legs
[2:07:12] jeffhunter12: sibling maybe
[2:07:21] Gat0rCh0mp: yikes
[2:07:27] Omakie: she is a farming player it looks like
[2:07:30] CamberCYM: "Cold streak" Mmmhmm
[2:07:37] Felgrun: Yeah no this looks like a very tilted gold player
[2:07:39] Omakie: likes long laning and long games
[2:07:43] ZeroDjinn: went on a hot streak before too so could be inflated MMR for harder teams
[2:07:56] andreaslorozco: why focus so much on what you can't control, vs looking at what you could have improved?
[2:08:06] tkcross21: summoner name change ?
[2:08:27] Felgrun: ADC time Pog
[2:08:38] Gat0rCh0mp: yeah he was getting found out too much and people openning the stream during game @tkcross21
[2:08:43] andreaslorozco: gotcha, for the content... good enough
[2:08:45] Kalvixish: Honestly I feel like they should just stop bothering with changing the balance in LoL, and work on solo Q MMR.
[2:09:08] Omakie: i like them making things more tanky
[2:09:13] cloudaeris1: ahri allways get banned lol
[2:09:14] tkcross21: @Gat0rCh0mp 👍
[2:09:19] Kalvixish: I'm 100% ok with the balance, it doesn't bother me, it does bother me when my ADC feeds 17 deaths so I had 0% chance of winning.

[2:09:43] Kyuukotsu: I ban champs I see every game to be honest, and MF is so over picked. I'm not surprised by the ban.
[2:09:44] epicshoo: pepeSmoke
[2:09:45] Felgrun: Its one of the most played adcs so maybe high idk
[2:09:47] BaosilisK: catJAM
[2:09:50] ワフルデラ: MF is pretty strong in low elo

[2:11:37] Felgrun: sus
[2:12:22] ChowYun: Ap malph is still a thing? Lol
[2:12:23] thesestrangenotions: what's adc in LoL?
[2:12:41] archinctp: these silver game hit different
[2:12:47] Baske_T: Rammus is ok
[2:12:54] LagoutLoud: AP malphite is the best way to lose to shopekeeper
[2:13:01] LagoutLoud: followed by AP cho
[2:13:13] Felgrun: @thesestrangenotions Consistent physical damage dealers usually through auto attacks
[2:13:26] ChowYun: Adc is attack damage carry
[2:13:38] ワフルデラ: so we had a malz that got jungle autofilled but picked as if he was mid
[2:13:44] ワフルデラ: not we have no jungle and playing 2v1v2
[2:14:03] Kalvixish: dammit Pyke!
[2:14:05] thesestrangenotions: ah thanks. is there a glossary or something I can use for LoL terms whenever JP plays?
[2:14:13] Kalvixish: I mean at least Pyke can carry as well I guess
[2:14:23] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord
[2:14:35] Felgrun: @thesestrangenotions I dont think so
[2:16:13] Kalvixish: no Pyke, don't drag in death
[2:16:30] archinctp: that Pyke skin is sweet
[2:16:32] Felgrun: Lucian/Nami deals so much damage
[2:16:50] ritchie313: wow jp playing really well actually maybe adc might be ur real main lol
[2:16:52] Shoaron: Nami counter trist
[2:17:00] Felgrun: I'd wait until 6
[2:17:03] ChowYun: Ull die to minions and nami bubble
[2:17:10] Kalvixish: In terms of jump in, 2 things to consider are wave size and your level. So if you have just leveled to higher than then and thinned the wave you can jump in
[2:17:45] Kalvixish: But Lucian is good during the lane phase so you shouldn't expect to win ealry
[2:17:52] Kalvixish: and should just focus on last hitting till you scale to late game
[2:18:08] Felgrun: Team is doin good lets go
[2:18:16] Biskus: !MCUCrew

[2:18:18] Kalvixish: you need to hard shove the lane before you can back
[2:18:22] Kalvixish: get it to crash
[2:18:31] Kalvixish: otherwise you'll lose farm under your tower
[2:18:53] Kalvixish: I 100% would back, so ye start attacking non stop to hard shove the wave
[2:19:17] Kalvixish: if you can get the wave to crash you can back and not lose much farm
[2:19:51] Felgrun: Minion management is the most unfun thing in this game I stg
[2:20:16] Kalvixish: thats why I don't lane and just jungle :P
[2:20:24] Kalvixish: but to be a good jungler you need to understand wave management at least a bit
[2:20:47] Kalvixish: so now you can all in
[2:20:52] Kalvixish: you've bought and he hasn't
[2:20:55] Felgrun: I just dont worry about it and just hope i kill the other laner

[2:22:19] Kalvixish: and now you can hard shove
[2:22:24] Kalvixish: that was 100% worth
[2:22:47] Felgrun: Nami deals a shitload of damage so just watch out for that
[2:23:23] TDotTerror: Oh, a Triss day, eh?
[2:23:26] Felgrun: Dude just bought the whole potion shop
[2:23:37] Kalvixish: ok you can hard shove that now

[2:24:20] ChowYun: Quick Q and he out atpRtsd
[2:25:27] Xinder88: the pyke fucked the Ekko's stun there
[2:25:39] Xinder88: He saved her from being stunned
[2:25:41] Kalvixish: remember if you have a spare 75g on a back to buy a control ward, then you can put it in your tri-brush
[2:25:45] Felgrun: Kat cancelling autos like a pro
[2:26:05] Kalvixish: supp should be warding, but if you help with it you'll avoid being ganked a lot
[2:26:10] kasded: Clean
[2:26:17] BaosilisK: KEKW
[2:26:17] tkcross21: ijpCHEER ijpCHEER ijpCHEER
[2:26:29] Felgrun: That lucian dashed into that LUL
[2:26:42] Kalvixish: you can hard shove this under tower again
[2:26:47] Kalvixish: and dive them if they try to fight
[2:26:52] epicshoo: hypeE
[2:27:08] Kalvixish: careful their bot will be back very soon
[2:27:15] Kalvixish: as in like now :P
[2:27:30] Kalvixish: apparently Sej just wanted to feed instaed
[2:27:53] epicshoo: you get first tower but they get a bounty tower OMEGALUL
[2:27:57] Kalvixish: tell your Malphite to go bot
[2:28:00] The_Faceless_Void: KEKW imagine your ADC is 21/5 AND LSOING THE GAME
[2:28:00] Kalvixish: while you go mid
[2:28:07] The_Faceless_Void: I fucking need mental therapy
[2:28:10] Kalvixish: as carry you should swap to mid and take that now
[2:28:27] Atorxke: Nazoos
[2:29:01] The_Faceless_Void: wukong modCheck ult?
[2:29:05] Xinder88: I thought the kat was already one of the dead myself
[2:29:11] Kalvixish: still worth, you get mid from that probalby
[2:29:24] kaamio1: o.o
[2:29:37] aideh: sus
[2:29:37] Kalvixish: swap to top now
[2:29:49] Felgrun: because he's a coward
[2:29:49] Kalvixish: you need to be swapping the carry/sup to whatever lane has its outer
[2:29:54] Kalvixish: ok sorry :9
[2:29:58] Kalvixish: :(
[2:30:01] ghostsofcarcosa: @Kalvixish Chill it out.

[2:30:15] Kalvixish: ye I'm a little drunk, I'll stop
[2:30:39] yogaplayz: i dont see the problem with trying to help
[2:30:43] kapjak: @Kalvixish cheers whatcha drinking
[2:30:53] Xinder88: @yogaplays I think it's the volume of help
[2:30:58] Xinder88: not the concept of wanting to help
[2:31:01] Kalvixish: I'm going a bit overboard I will admit. And @kapjak brandy
[2:31:04] ghostsofcarcosa: @yogaplays It's not about trying to help its the volume/frequency and a lot of it isn't particularly useful.
[2:31:16] ghostsofcarcosa: No offense @Kalvixish
[2:31:25] zechetto: Pike kill with a pike assist? Is that how his passive works?
[2:31:28] yogaplayz: @ghostsofcarcosa chat with no chatting is awesome i guess
[2:31:30] kapjak: @Kalvixish ooh fancy, im drinking vodka and diet coke after a pint of ipa
[2:31:42] Xinder88: JP started out league playing ADC so he certainly isn't a beginner in that role
[2:32:18] epicshoo: monkaS
[2:32:23] Xinder88: I never know when to swap to blue trinket in the game
[2:32:34] BaosilisK: nami vanished LUL
[2:32:50] Kalvixish: nice :)

[2:33:33] Xinder88: and Sejuani
[2:33:47] HadieHim: pyke pulled nasus towards you
[2:33:47] Kalvixish: Ye this Malph doesn't want to accept the laning phase is over
[2:33:59] Felgrun: Its his lane and he wont give it to anyone else
[2:34:02] ritchie313: he pickes maphite who can roam well and impact lanes but then doesnt do anthing
[2:34:16] Xinder88: @ritchie313 He ahs roamed a lot, but yeah doesn't wanna give up the mid lol
[2:34:26] an_kush: i see ap malph doing its thing
[2:34:52] Felgrun: AP nasus aka the ICBM
[2:34:52] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:34:52] Xinder88: Is there an item in the game that gives ranged characters slightly more attack range?
[2:35:01] Felgrun: Malphite not Nasus
[2:35:03] Felgrun: derp
[2:35:08] Kalvixish: @Xinder88 there was at least on energised attacks
[2:35:17] Kalvixish: @Xinder88 er... the barrel gun crit item, I can't remember its name

[2:35:32] an_kush: melted that nami
[2:35:32] Kalvixish: thats the one
[2:35:44] Xinder88: Ohhh that's cool
[2:35:59] Felgrun: Malph needs to to his thing to kat
[2:35:59] PrinceofTheUniverse: jp were there any videos you watched to learn to play league or was it just playing over long period of time?
[2:36:03] Xinder88: ADC and Support are the 2 roles I've yet to play since coming back to league after 10 years lol
[2:36:37] Kalvixish: I like having a Pyke purely as if the carry fails to do well, the Pyke can take over as carry
[2:36:42] debajr: I a tually think solo ulting the nami is less effective than wainting for them to group up...
[2:36:44] kapjak: you mentioned switching to valorant, did you play og csgo back in the day?
[2:37:10] an_kush: you played dota before? the WC3 map by icefrog @itmeJP ?
[2:37:16] ghostsofcarcosa: Sometimes its nice to coast haha
[2:37:41] epicshoo: furryRun
[2:38:17] Gorn_Vernaleer: Malph is fun
[2:38:22] Felgrun: Ah yes, the classic flash away jump back in strat
[2:38:26] Felgrun: No one expects it
[2:38:55] Xinder88: Lol when the other 2 came out of the brush to surround you lol
[2:39:08] Xinder88: That was a "welp I'm dead, may as well go out swinging" moment
[2:39:14] HadieHim: they dive for you, then they die
[2:39:15] Kalvixish: I mean you hurt Nasus a lot, and he's the only 1 who can carry them right now
[2:39:21] an_kush: LUL
[2:39:25] Felgrun: Just ADC doing ADC things

[2:40:05] Felgrun: TP and ghost
[2:40:08] Rinuz: no damage on those two
[2:40:09] HadieHim: wukong went top for some reason
[2:40:11] Xinder88: pyke malph only ones left and low hp? I guess?
[2:40:17] Xinder88: Wait wukong didn't help?
[2:40:25] Xinder88: Wtf?
[2:40:29] Darkaros: peepoArrive Hello from my hotel with Thai Tea
[2:40:37] Felgrun: Only malph and pyke on dragon, wukong either died or left
[2:40:54] Xinder88: I dunno why wukong would leave lol
[2:41:02] Xinder88: Sejuani
[2:41:03] Xinder88: uh oh
[2:41:04] Kalvixish: @Xinder88 he's a laner, they do that
[2:41:08] Felgrun: He's a coward thats why
[2:41:48] Kalvixish: worst part is Wukong had the best single target damage
[2:42:04] Darkaros: stripNote So this is JP's 3rd-at-least ADC game eh
[2:42:31] Sinfidel: !! That's not our Troll. ADC JP is back!

[2:47:47] Kalvixish: Personally, I like to break the tension by pretending I mis-typed on "lets kick some ass" and typing "lets lick some ass". It puts everybody in a light hearted mood I find
