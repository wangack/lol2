[0:58:51] bakavic: this is smash without the polish
[0:58:54] ryukenchi: hitbox
[0:58:59] BigWaldo7713: not the best way to showcase this game

[0:59:44] BigWaldo7713: so many expansions LUL
[0:59:57] ProxyClouds: I wonder if they will ever make a Stellaris 2 rather then just keep pumping out DLC
[1:00:02] UnboundSouls: or was that just the April fools update
[1:00:05] TheCaselock: It’s just a less-good Super Smash Bros. Hard pass
[1:00:05] Makimachine: @UnboundSouls The Worm is Love!

[1:00:28] Mujona: That was a Quantum Catapult.
[1:00:41] dekai_hara: cool looking trailer
[1:00:42] BigWaldo7713: this game makes dead or alive dlc look tame
[1:00:50] Hemry64_: @P4rappa what you don't want to pay $200+ for all the DLC KEKW
[1:00:51] Miros__: @P4rappa Well, it is a Paradox game, after all

[1:03:13] DanteVanDeva: it is free on the game pass
[1:03:15] BigWaldo7713: theres not enough content to keep things going long term
[1:03:15] SaltyAsChuck: @itmeJP that's because it's very shallow and every game is a speed run
[1:03:21] AinzN: Rekatron it's an official NBAJam voice pack for Dota
[1:03:26] DanteVanDeva: It was alright @itmeJP
[1:03:28] De4dMaNz: only if u have friend lol.. but thats IMO only ya know
[1:03:33] Rustles2: It's alright but there are so many games that do 4 player coop better

[1:03:38] Baske_T: it's one of those games that are fun with friends
[1:03:43] Xibate: i forgot this existed
[1:03:48] Archangel3003: It probably has more players than that one single person still playing Babylons Fall though right.
[1:03:48] UnboundSouls: so they added a zombies mode?
[1:03:53] geoffsgayestfan: it's like super bland and boring apparently
[1:03:54] Kultak: my 16 year old nephew is really into it
[1:03:59] Insigmada: reminds me of killing floor
[1:04:00] AcroXL: this looks not good
[1:04:03] AinzN: Rekatron the video should be on YT so you should definitely check it out
[1:04:03] De4dMaNz: @geoffsgayestfan this is accurate
[1:04:09] UnboundSouls: why

[1:04:35] ZcottD: motion blur and a smaller fov, nice

[1:05:02] Si_Cwan: motion blur is OK if its done right, sad thing is, only about 1% of the games do it right
[1:05:02] Juksrace: they should also lower FPS then ;)
[1:05:11] xarantur: good thing this is only in til July
[1:05:29] afreak10: 🤮
[1:05:30] SonicTHI: my eyes hurt form just watching this shit
[1:05:32] Room42B: The base game is still good fun, but this spin off has never gripped much of the original player base
[1:05:32] Hathcyn: I just like that they are making Motion Blur a negative status effect but most game still launch with it as a default option on
[1:05:34] Darkaros: max level contamination your m+kb controls are disabled and are bound to a virtual controller instead
[1:05:36] Dunkhart: @AinzN yeah I found It, this is, this is a thing that exists. for sure ijpLAUGH
[1:05:40] AceAssegai: usually the devs don't play the games are a terrible meme, but in this case I feel like it's apt
[1:05:43] JeedanJune: love the super low visibility KEKW
[1:05:43] ritchie313: this feels complicated

[1:53:49] MaxVolume: 2 buttons is fine for me. Warcries is where I draw the line
[1:53:51] svensonidis: @Lutcha81 they already know... it's gonna be fixed in 3.19
[1:53:55] Onefootstout: seems cool
[1:53:56] Sauskavr: @the043 doesnt matter now
[1:53:57] VeloRama: how does he know it's still bugged after the 3.18 patch though cohhSus
[1:54:10] ritchie313: @VeloRama they said they will not fix it
[1:54:11] k0jak: played it a few leagues ago it fucks
[1:54:13] SaltyAsChuck: @itmeJP Just macro desecrate to your right-click 250ms slower than your detonate dead.. ez pz
[1:54:14] Cixah: because there are no changes
[1:54:16] JeedanJune: ye i'm doing this before they fix it, i never played a "broken" build before so i wanna try
[1:54:17] Neurodrive101: unethical
[1:54:17] zombo_com: he stole ur music
[1:54:19] Sauskavr: @VeloRama because they confirmed it wont be fixed
[1:54:19] Lutcha81: @Lutcha81 ok still, everyone and their mum will be playing this then
[1:54:22] Mrshilka: patch has no skillc hanges
[1:54:24] DobbsjustDobbs: They said they aren't fixing the bug, but they didn fix the atlas passive that was gonna make it nutty
[1:54:30] the043: @the043 how? what changed?
[1:54:31] Nex210: nope lol
[1:54:31] JeedanJune: MmmHmm @Mrshilka
[1:54:31] Puretaz: Think im going to go explosive arrow
[1:54:35] DobbsjustDobbs: They did fix
[1:54:37] Sauskavr: yeah you can do T16's with no gear at all
[1:54:37] johnfive21: this will be 20%+ at the start
[1:54:39] Mrshilka: also G'day @itmeJP and chat! ijpH
[1:54:45] kotwin: iirc Lightee did all the content on DD with blue items only
[1:54:49] Teloh: And block cap
[1:54:54] Hemanse: Its tanky AF
[1:54:54] afreak10: its really beefy
[1:54:55] Mrshilka: @JeedanJune MmmHmm
[1:55:02] Ravnim: don't have to focus dmg on gear just defense
[1:55:06] Sauskavr: yeah you need no gear at all to do t16's
[1:55:09] CorporalPibb: probably good for permadeath?
[1:55:19] Mujona: Yeah
[1:55:20] kremdes: yep
[1:55:20] SZebra: yes
[1:55:20] Tripc897: Yes
[1:55:21] Joulupukin: yea
[1:55:21] Hemanse: YEP
[1:55:21] Teloh: yes
[1:55:22] Insigmada: yes
[1:55:22] Sauskavr: ueaj
[1:55:22] afreak10: yeah
[1:55:22] muffinface__: yes
[1:55:22] JeedanJune: yea
[1:55:23] johnfive21: YEP
[1:55:23] Cixah: yes
[1:55:24] Sauskavr: yeah
[1:55:25] CorporalPibb: ye
[1:55:25] the043: yep
[1:55:27] johnfive21: 60% more than it should
[1:55:30] Insigmada: it not meant to have that hp
[1:55:37] Cixah: Auric + Specter Bug = 900% BASE MONSTER HP specter
[1:55:38] JeedanJune: so still a good build if they nerf it tbh
[1:55:41] kotwin: it would be still very strong without it, but this way it's quite busted
[1:55:41] Weeniz: We love abusing bugs and advertising it
[1:55:41] Tripc897: The champion has 561% health
[1:55:43] Cixah: its basically just free damage
[1:55:44] SZebra: KEKW
[1:55:50] kremdes: @itmeJP and in the atlas you skill map enemies do 25% less damage and have 50% more life. So it soubble dips again
[1:55:50] Tripc897: If you get to the end of Ignite DD, and don't like it, you can swap to Skelly Mage Necromancer if you hate it
[1:55:51] Mrshilka: there is new uber boss to try too
[1:55:54] Ravnim: uber uber shaper PauseChamp
[1:55:55] CarcosanStag: how likely is it that this would be patched or fixed before/during the league tho?
[1:55:56] EvoCaliber: ijpNODDERS
[1:56:00] Insigmada: and the desecrate also over populates with your specters too atm
[1:56:00] CorporalPibb: it would be pretty neat
[1:56:01] Mud__: ijpNODDERS
[1:56:02] SZebra: @kremdes That has been fixed.
[1:56:05] pinnyo: Are both builds just bugged? 😂
[1:56:07] JeedanJune: nooo JP will steal my rng Madge
[1:56:10] SaltyAsChuck: @Weeniz he talked about it a bit back on his stream and said it was reported at league start and never got fixed.. so he was going to use it again lol
[1:56:12] JeedanJune: PepeLaugh
[1:56:17] Tripc897: @Quadra1x 0%, GGG said they were leaving it in
[1:56:28] Teloh: Honestly, its probably worth experiencing at least once
[1:56:31] Teloh: The power and tankiness
[1:56:35] CarcosanStag: @Quadra1x awesome, tyty
[1:56:43] Lutcha81: @Quadra1x until 75% of all players are playing this and they fix it anyway ?
[1:56:45] AinzN: Mrshilka ijpH
[1:56:46] Mrshilka: there is no skill changes this patch
[1:56:51] Teloh: NODDERS
[1:56:53] Mrshilka: its the same skills as last patrch
[1:56:53] HadieHim: do it
[1:56:54] Redemption99: it's a strong pick
[1:56:55] TabascoFool: I always play minions, I'm happy
[1:57:00] Mrshilka: @AinzN Ainz! ijpH
[1:57:00] Insigmada: DD is funny to play in the synthesis zones desecrate only has your specters so you just melt everything in there
[1:57:03] ritchie313: if you want a smooth no issue build than yeah this is it
[1:57:04] SMonTwitch: me too
[1:57:06] zymioi: is there a reason why he does not go threw the trap tree ?w with this
[1:57:06] Sauskavr: @Lutcha81 doesnt matter if people are playing
[1:57:12] Algorithm07: might ruin trying anything else is only downside
[1:57:13] Alanthesheep: I do like Ziz's builds
[1:57:14] pinnyo: I hope ggg just gives this guy tons of money.
[1:57:26] muffinface__: @itmeJP there is also a new atlas nodes that decrease monster dmg but increases there life.
[1:57:31] omid__79: the only downside of dd is that mapping is not that fun with it imo
[1:57:39] JeedanJune: yes Chris Wilson will go to his house and just drop a buncha cash @pinnyo
[1:57:43] Kyrvix: @muffinface__ Doesn't affect DD damage
[1:57:51] Lutcha81: @sauskavr ofc it does, if everyone is playing this build it nullifies the economy and what they put in the game as new, if everyone can just shit all over it
[1:58:13] JeedanJune: economy ResidentSleeper
[1:58:21] Sauskavr: @Lutcha81 it really doesnt they stated on the recent podcasts they do not look at what people are playing
[1:58:32] Sauskavr: you clearly didnt watch Chris on the podcast this week
[1:58:38] JeedanJune: the best leagues where when the economy was so broken when everything was cheap af @Lutcha81
[1:58:41] zombo_com: @JeedanJune how can you tell if someone doesnt like economy? Dont worry they wont shutup about it
[1:58:43] Teloh: You're omega tanky
[1:58:45] afreak10: very tanky
[1:58:46] muffinface__: @muffinface__ :(
[1:58:47] omid__79: and 100% spell supp
[1:58:56] Sauskavr: and also they have said several times they will not fix this until 3.19
[1:59:01] JeedanJune: @zombo_com or if they love it same same PepeLaugh
[1:59:05] zombo_com: drue
[2:00:17] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour.

Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[2:00:23] Insigmada: The tentacle mtx is sweet also LUL
[2:00:25] the043: this will be my backup (again) if I end up hating traps (again)
[2:00:54] Teloh: This is a DoT build as well
[2:00:57] tglenn: wonder how long it took to figure out which minion to use for the specter
[2:01:02] TOBerserk: do the build quin is starting with shockwave cylone
[2:01:04] ErikThe_Viking: I'm going to test out lightning trapper tomorrow
[2:01:05] moist_heinous: that's nice
[2:01:09] Sauskavr: this will be the go to setup if you want a very easy start
[2:01:33] JeedanJune: spectral helix will be a LOT weaker than DD PepeLaugh
[2:01:34] Insigmada: tglenn all that is data mined. just took someone to look at the sheets for the hp
[2:01:36] Kyriac: this is actually the build im doing
[2:01:42] JeedanJune: this looks really cool
[2:01:54] SZebra: SH is basically Blessed Hammer from D2, isn't it?
[2:01:56] Ravnim: reroll DansGame

[2:02:20] Madude89: that looks like simulacrum
[2:02:22] omid__79: he's going simulacrum i guess
[2:02:24] freaker286: @JeedanJune I was just about to say, love it
[2:02:27] omid__79: doing*
[2:02:29] Joulupukin: that is simulacrum that is why it looks worse dmg
[2:02:32] JeedanJune: @freaker286 yea its amazing
[2:02:35] afreak10: yeah
[2:02:35] kotwin: it's also simulacrum 30 instead of just t16 maps
[2:02:36] Xanctius: Delirium 30 bosses
[2:02:38] Insigmada: I don't think you will like this. it's build up positional skill.
[2:02:39] JeedanJune: yea Simulacrum / Delirium
[2:02:42] Teloh: Yea this is a Simulacrum, so shit is kinda tanky
[2:02:44] afreak10: simulacrum
[2:02:46] ErikThe_Viking: Pretty tanky
[2:02:53] Ravnim: hp is giong crazy LUL
[2:02:54] afreak10: goes up to 30 now
[2:03:04] VeloRama: hollow knight cohh3
[2:03:12] TabascoFool: now I want to play hollow knight
[2:03:28] BarsS1mpson: God damn now I have to go back and play Hollow Knight
[2:03:32] zombo_com: simulacrum

[2:04:01] Sauskavr: HH got gutted though with the change to rare mobs
[2:04:04] JeedanJune: ratJAM
[2:04:05] Nex210: giga defense
[2:04:08] ワフルデラ: this guy looks like a prime candidate for r/13or30
[2:04:10] omid__79: this build also uses one of the new amulets which is pretty cool if you haven't interacted with it before
[2:04:22] janpp95: i personally disliked lightning strike due to the requirered positioning to deal decent damage
[2:04:39] Bob__Z: how much is that belt?
[2:05:01] MoosidoreTheDuck: @ワフルデラ 100%
[2:05:18] Kyriac: traps are yucky
[2:05:20] Madude89: last league I had sick perseverance
[2:05:29] ranin: Last league I played was harvest, how out of it will i be this league launch?
[2:05:31] moist_heinous: serious beard
[2:05:40] shibbsyy: Amish-inspired.
[2:05:42] Neurodrive101: fire trap elementalist seems a bit better
[2:05:47] the043: fast and traps in the same sentence? LUL
[2:05:54] omid__79: KEKW
[2:05:57] Sauskavr: @the043 traps can be very fast
[2:05:59] CocoScruff: this guy's beard is out of control
[2:06:01] SZebra: I'm probably going to run back EA Champion. Because I'm a vanilla ice-cream kind of guy.
[2:06:15] SaltyAsChuck: This is why I watch youtube videos at 1.25 or 1.5 speed
[2:06:27] TOBerserk: If you want to go traps seismic exang traps are better
[2:06:27] shibbsyy: "I like traps." - JP 2022. ijpONO
[2:06:29] JeedanJune: same @SaltyAsChuck
[2:06:30] Insigmada: ranin not really. I find PoE is easy to repick up. you can focus on the stuff you know and slowly catch onto the newer stuff
[2:06:41] omid__79: and traps are GREAT bossers and this league by the looks of it is a bossing league
[2:06:52] the043: I'm giving phys traps a chance this league before it gets nerfed
[2:06:56] VeloRama: that's what i call a neckbeard
[2:06:58] JeedanJune: yea that's true, traps always destroy bosses @omid__79
[2:07:01] shibbsyy: Never liked the trap playstyle. Sadge
[2:07:17] 00oniking00: by the beard
[2:07:19] afreak10: pretty slow
[2:07:43] ritchie313: this is a meh
[2:07:48] vashaun: how many builds has jp checked out?
[2:07:54] 00oniking00: its only me or PoE player want to press 1 button and finish the game?
[2:08:05] rich16bit: most poe build guides are like coding tutorials
[2:08:08] ErikThe_Viking: Less presses the better
[2:08:16] afreak10: @00oniking00 some do , some don't
[2:08:18] johnfive21: ideally 0 buttons @00oniking00
[2:08:22] zymioi: @00oniking00 that good thing about poe many play option
[2:08:24] 00oniking00: not press the same button over and over but just once LUL
[2:08:27] JeedanJune: yes because monsters are so fast and hit so hard more than 1 button generally means you will be dead @00oniking00 not always but it does make it easier
[2:08:32] shibbsyy: Less presses = focus more on mechanics imo.
[2:08:38] JeedanJune: ^
[2:08:39] Incredible_Sausage: i love it when build videos start out like "this starter build only costs 47 exalts, let's get into it..."
[2:08:43] Incredible_Sausage: KEKW
[2:08:49] Algorithm07: yea no ty
[2:08:54] johnfive21: yea JP's playing DD ijpHMM
[2:08:54] JeedanJune: i mean you started with the best one KEKW
[2:08:54] UnboundSouls: Poison conc is pretty good
[2:08:56] ritchie313: we blew out load on DD
[2:09:00] kremdes: 3 buttons, self curse, fire trap and burn trap
[2:09:00] BuggleStrus: If you're going to trap you might as well phys trap
[2:09:01] UnboundSouls: i think so
[2:09:02] the043: yea, 3.16
[2:09:05] JeedanJune: that hair Pog
[2:09:05] Nex210: pohx's bible for rf is Pog lol
[2:09:07] Madude89: skele mages spoiled you already lol
[2:09:10] quazy: RF PgChamp
[2:09:12] ritchie313: he had a whole ass wiki
[2:09:15] Kyriac: i bet he would be a good in bed
[2:09:16] SlCKNESS: @rich16bit I don't think u've seen a an actual coding tutorial, they're a lot more straightforward and engaging than PoE build guides
[2:09:17] Insigmada: 3.17 got a lot of nice stuff for RF
[2:09:18] EightBitDelight: Im going RF
[2:09:18] afreak10: Pohx RF is very solid , but i really hate the playstyle
[2:09:18] ranin: hope poe2 slows the game down a bit
[2:09:19] DobbsjustDobbs: His wiki on it is INSANE
[2:09:23] UnboundSouls: nothing
[2:09:24] Hemanse: Pog x
[2:09:28] ワフルデラ: weaknesses get patched up said Ziz
[2:09:29] DobbsjustDobbs: Fire traps, that;s it
[2:09:37] Teloh: Uses firetrap for added dam now too
[2:09:38] iXlightLess: you need to play as much as him to make RF work
[2:09:39] UnboundSouls: there are new uniques for engame gearing
[2:09:39] Algorithm07: RF is pretty crazy atm
[2:09:39] kotwin: 3.17 improved map clear by quite a bit via Maven's boots explosions
[2:09:41] omid__79: this is one of THE best build guide in poe Pog
[2:09:41] Empyrialist: nothing is changing for anything in 3.18, but yeah, it got slightly buffed in 3.17
[2:09:44] uzling: I like the 3.18 with curse on frostblink so much over his older versions
[2:09:51] Insigmada: Maven boots got changed, fire trap, neck
[2:09:57] muffinface__: @itmeJP you get flame trap now with RF
