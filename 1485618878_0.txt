[0:13:47] Imbadyoureworse: pedipalps are each of the second pair of appendages attached to the cephalothorax of most arachnids. They are variously specialized as pincers in scorpions, sensory organs in spiders, and locomotory organs in horseshoe crabs.

[0:32:49] Voidruner: This was not better than the first one
[0:32:52] SpaceDive: spiderman 1 DansGame
[0:32:56] Reckless_Rob: Me too
[0:32:57] m3rcer: cohhGasp
[0:32:58] Kagutsuchiii: ijpNODDERS the flip
[0:32:59] Barrh: it is a good origin story
[0:33:04] mob1900: burkeClap burkeClap burkeClap
[0:33:08] geonoxes: I feel like its near Strange 1, in that area
[0:33:25] LeelandGrant: Dr Strange 2 is right below civil war i think
[0:33:35] Omid18: I will never get over the fact that you guys thought iron man 2 is better than ant man and the wasp. it eats me from inside
[0:33:39] Reckless_Rob: For me its bottom half
[0:33:40] Ravnim: better than ant man for me
[0:33:43] allups: i stand the hulk should be higher
[0:33:51] NicVspz: It probably should just straight up be nr. 11
[0:33:56] Zrmi: Civil War was better than Multiverse of Madness
[0:33:59] Reckless_Rob: @allups I love you, but you are insane
[0:34:00] geonoxes: With more time, I feel like Eternerls should be below Captain Marvel
[0:34:10] yodelrodel: Civil War was better I think
[0:34:10] DyingEros: 14
[0:34:11] Voidruner: Beneath Age of Ultron for me tbh
[0:34:14] tyriaan: black panther was better
[0:34:19] qdazzarus: eternals should be below hulk lol
[0:34:21] Hagaroth: 16 for me
[0:34:23] Reckless_Rob: 21 for me I think
[0:34:27] Imbadyoureworse: idk zombie strange with a cloak of damned spirits flying around was pretty sweet
[0:34:29] allups: @Reckless_Rob im the only one who is sane
[0:34:32] LeelandGrant: 14 sounds good
[0:34:37] Reckless_Rob: @allups Ahh..maybe..
[0:35:01] Crafteroon: I would put it above Far From Home.
[0:35:15] Voidruner: The first part was good, the moment they start running in the tunnels, it goes down drastically
[0:35:29] 23Thijs: below ultron
[0:35:34] walternatorz: It turned into the full blown horror film at that point
[0:35:47] DD_The_Shmey: I disagree
[0:35:49] Barrh: i think the illuminati part was in the reshoots
[0:35:59] Reckless_Rob: I dont know them...personally
[0:36:07] jjaamm0: dr strange 2 visual s+ story c-
[0:36:08] Imbadyoureworse: man I had a different time. I thought the movie was a ton a fun
[0:36:11] Iamdenril: because it was cool tho
[0:36:15] DD_The_Shmey: I think the battle with illuminati was sick, I was totally invested in the characters
[0:36:16] kazen01: it did have cool moments
[0:36:31] Reckless_Rob: LUL
[0:36:32] leovic1: ijpONO
[0:36:33] yrvengalied: rearrange hypeE
[0:36:35] SpaceDive: do it all over again
[0:36:36] yrvengalied: CHAOS
[0:36:37] SpaceDive: LUL
[0:36:38] yrvengalied: hypeE
[0:36:43] Reckless_Rob: Insert, but then also rearrange
[0:36:50] Wedrikul: CHAOS
[0:36:53] 0GHammer: insert the movie first
[0:36:53] the_ch0: TIME FOR CHAOS hypeE
[0:36:54] 23Thijs: I think you should get to rerank the previous movie to get rid of recency bias
[0:36:57] Barrh: ok time for a fresh rewatch of all the movies and re rank it Kappa
[0:36:57] Iamdenril: @DD_The_Shmey agreed
[0:36:57] DD_The_Shmey: I think this movie better than  first dr strange
[0:37:01] Voidruner: Civil war was way better than this dr strange
[0:37:03] 0GHammer: stop trying to negotiate rearrangements LUL
[0:37:08] jeffhunter12: weve gone into politics
[0:37:19] Imbadyoureworse: i think its better than black panmther
[0:37:21] Reckless_Rob: @0GHammer LUL
[0:37:22] Imbadyoureworse: there is said it
[0:37:26] Darkaros: don't fall for it Bronze/Jesse. Never forget that he scammed Endgame into 2
[0:37:26] akmannen: Dr strange 2 is iron man 2 tier
[0:37:31] DaRandalizer: Captain Marvel is better than Far from home etc.
[0:37:34] leovic1: ijpKEK
[0:37:37] DD_The_Shmey: @iamdenril yep ijpNODDERS
[0:37:39] OmarKhaledBadr: We're back to the delegations everybody LUL
[0:37:45] EvilBuho: Black Panther is in my top 5, so for sure it should be higher lol
[0:37:56] Reckless_Rob: I think Black Pan cause ive seen it less
[0:38:08] Reckless_Rob: Shang chi is so high though
[0:38:09] Imbadyoureworse: i must need a black panther re watch
[0:38:10] noMaDNINe: 15
[0:38:15] saiyanadam: I still think black panther is mid
[0:38:22] SpaceDive: no way home should be lower
[0:38:23] Barrh: love ant man
[0:38:27] Voidruner: First Avenger is way to high on this list LUL
[0:38:27] Ravnim: I'd rewatch because of the Raimi scenes
[0:38:31] Reckless_Rob: I love Rudd man
[0:38:32] leovic1: ijpCHEER ant-man
[0:38:37] LeelandGrant: Guardians 2 is a great rewatch
[0:38:47] Iamdenril: too far JESSE
[0:38:51] WDForty: I think you gotta do insert only, unless the movie being inserted is connected/impacts how one watches a previous movie (e.g. Infinity War + End Game)
[0:38:54] DyingEros: 14
[0:38:58] DyingEros: It is definitely a 14 movie
[0:39:18] geonoxes: I think its better than Cap 1
[0:39:20] Imbadyoureworse: 14 sure i could see that
[0:39:23] Voidruner: guardians were way more fun than strange
[0:39:29] DyingEros: We only like FA cause Chris Evans is so screen likable. The story and pace is and can be as bad as MoM
[0:39:30] Zrmi: Doctor Strange> Civil War>Multiverse of Madness
[0:39:31] Reckless_Rob: It's a toughie
[0:39:33] LeelandGrant: 14, but i could see 17
[0:39:41] DD_The_Shmey: I think the new dr strange should be somewhere around Shang Chi, and definitly above Dr Strange 1... woah I think Jesse is crazy
[0:39:58] Imbadyoureworse: i liked it better than the first strange as well
[0:39:59] ritchie313: it did nothing for the overall plot of marvel other than introducing chavez
[0:40:01] kazen01: thats fair
[0:40:06] noMaDNINe: cap amarica is better
[0:40:13] SpaceDive: low mid yeah
[0:40:14] Reckless_Rob: Btw, how is Spiderman above both Avengers movies?
[0:40:15] noMaDNINe: 15 16
[0:40:16] DD_The_Shmey: way way better than civil war, omg
[0:40:19] Imbadyoureworse: does it need to do something for the overall plot of marvel? id say no
[0:40:31] Ravnim: DrS2 probably one of the better mcu sequels but that's not saying much
[0:40:34] leovic1: ijpKEK JP really angling for a reorder
[0:40:46] spideycsa: 13.5
[0:40:47] ritchie313: @Imbadyoureworse it does with how early into phase 4 we are
[0:40:53] Iamdenril: false!
[0:40:53] Voidruner: Agreed
[0:40:57] leovic1: NODDERS
[0:41:00] bsamuraiking: agreed
[0:41:00] sotasty_: it's 16
[0:41:01] Crafteroon: I think Dr Strange 2 brings more to the MCU than Guardians 2 because it opens the horror and more brutal options to MCU films.
[0:41:02] DD_The_Shmey: give me rank 8
[0:41:05] Reckless_Rob: Ant Man is precious
[0:41:09] Hagaroth: I'd rewatch ant man no probel
[0:41:12] OmarKhaledBadr: Also Michael Douglas
[0:41:22] Hyper_Remy: I constantly forget about the black widow movie
[0:41:24] LeelandGrant: if you put it below antman, it should be below guardians 2 as well
[0:41:24] Voidruner: I think this movie heavily depends on weather you are a Sam Remi fan
[0:41:30] geonoxes: The script is tighter for sure
[0:41:34] p00pouri: wow i've never seen this list before, there are movies lower than captain marvel?? thats insane
[0:41:34] Iamdenril: dr strange 2 had the balls to use its pg13 rating and should be higher up for that alone
[0:41:46] Reckless_Rob: @Voidruner Yeah I guess so
[0:41:53] dahak777: Should not Move Around.... Just Insert only
[0:42:05] Ravnim: can't forgive marvel for getting rid of Edgar Wright for Ant man tho
[0:42:06] Barrh: id say 14 and antman at 15
[0:42:07] Iamdenril: wrong jesse!
[0:42:07] noMaDNINe: wtf 2 down .. below cap meraica
[0:42:11] Scott_Buckley: 100% agree
[0:42:20] 23Thijs: 13 is way too high
[0:42:26] p00pouri: @Ravnim yea the louis scenes are the only thing that remain from him
[0:42:27] Iamdenril: 13 is fine
[0:42:28] Toscacake: we're not ready for reordering, not yet
[0:42:32] ZeoBishop: LUL
[0:42:32] leovic1: KEKW
[0:42:33] DD_The_Shmey: I think its 1000% better than civil war
[0:42:35] Reckless_Rob: Its just not
[0:42:36] Acheron13: Civil War is too low in this list
[0:42:37] Voidruner: no way it's better than civil war
[0:42:39] NicVspz: Jesse on the hate train
[0:42:43] Sir_Myrmidon: civil war is better
[0:42:44] ReginaldXIV: I think the reorder should happen after Thor
[0:42:46] crzymike: i love civil war
[0:42:47] FrenzyAggressor: hell no its not better
[0:42:52] Barrh: it had spidey in it
[0:42:54] LeelandGrant: civil war is better
[0:43:02] EvilBuho: Civil War was trash, it was for sure better than civil war
[0:43:09] dahak777: Id say wait for the reorder till the end of the phase?
[0:43:09] rich16bit: civil war one of the better marvel movies
[0:43:14] QConsolidated: ye might be better to wait for Thor to come out lol
[0:43:22] Reckless_Rob: @EvilBuho Now now, lets not say things well regret
[0:43:22] the_ch0: Kinda
[0:43:29] pc2400: Avengers 1?
[0:43:31] AinzN: Iron Man was in Hulk ijpSIP
[0:43:38] OmarKhaledBadr: Zeemo was also great
[0:43:44] Reckless_Rob: Zoomo
[0:43:49] yodelrodel: Black widow
[0:43:50] robrewster: fury
[0:43:56] Aurugorn: war machine variant*
[0:44:01] EvilBuho: @Reckless_Rob  it was so bad, and I am sticking to that. I guess its because I was such a huge fan of the comics and it was such a letdown
[0:44:10] Hagaroth: Thor had hawkeye
[0:44:13] Imbadyoureworse: im really looking forward to the new thor movie
[0:44:25] WDForty: Age of Ultron is the origin of Vision
[0:44:28] Reckless_Rob: @EvilBuho Yeah ok I get that. I red the comic after the movie OpieOP
[0:44:33] DD_The_Shmey: Civil war was alright, but the entire story of the villa, Zemo fell flat for me compared to Dr. Strange 2
[0:45:05] LeelandGrant: it was also to show wandas powerlevel
[0:45:27] spideycsa: I think 616 illuminate won't be a thing until they all fight Kang togeether
[0:45:38] m3rcer: appreciate it as a stepping stone i guess
[0:45:40] Alucard_ris: they said that the illuminati deaths will have consecuences in the future @itmeJP
[0:46:00] WDForty: it's "contained" for now
[0:46:06] Ravnim: @DD_The_Shmey wow, zemo is probably one of the best villains for me because by the end it redefine his arc in the movie while DrS2 Wanda's villain arc was bad throughout
[0:46:08] DD_The_Shmey: The big fight in Civil war was just as much fan service as the illuminati fight. The illuminati was a huge part of the plot of Dr. Strange Multiverse of Madness, a required part for the character growth of Dr. Strange and Wanda
[0:46:09] Barrh: there was a scene that show an app on tonys phone called illuminati so who knows LUL
[0:46:18] rich16bit: Age of Ultron sucks so bad worst marvel movie by far
[0:46:23] OmarKhaledBadr: 3 universes is what we saw really
[0:46:45] Hagaroth: This whole phase is very overpromising trailer and no commitment
[0:46:50] Voidruner: I personally feel Dr strange was a waste of potential
[0:47:02] p00pouri: I can't understand why people hate the Wanda arc in multiverse of madness, she was a hero for like 2 movies.... she's been a villain far more often and has never been mentally stable
[0:47:08] DD_The_Shmey: @Ravnim I thought the wanda villan arc corrected a terrible character history of wanda. It Fixed the character wanda. She was 1000% better as a villan than as a hero that never really made sense
[0:47:16] bsamuraiking: Dr Strange 2 was hella mid. I don't understand people saying it was better than Civil War
[0:47:30] Hyper_Remy: Shang chi seems crazy high
[0:47:32] crzymike: this all comes back to jp plot to increase the rank of ant-man
[0:47:41] DyingEros: Agreed
[0:47:53] Holrend: is there a link for the list?
[0:48:00] EvilBuho: Ant man is top 10 for me
[0:48:06] 23Thijs: yall are rating civil war so low tbh
[0:48:15] itmeJP: mcucrew.com/rankings
[0:48:20] Holrend: thank you
[0:48:26] walternatorz: ant man is the andy dalton line of marvel movies
[0:48:41] Blexun: artificial conflict
[0:48:43] furry_wolf2001b: VoteYea
[0:48:45] KatjeMauw: thats just bad writing
[0:48:55] DyingEros: Artifical conflict
[0:48:56] OmarKhaledBadr: To be fair she was an admiral and didn't have to justify herself to an officer
[0:48:58] rich16bit: Yeah
[0:49:08] geonoxes: @walternatorz I wonder how many people in chat will understand that joke, but I love it
[0:49:15] Hyper_Remy: FailFish FailFish FailFish
[0:49:26] DD_The_Shmey: @Ravnim like, What was Wanda's origin story in Ultron?? She and her brother were experimental child soldiers that Hydra used as cannon fodder against the avengers to buy them time to escape. They were literally introduced as cannon fodder background characters... how she turned into one of the main hero's never made sense to me
[0:49:29] Ravnim: @DD_The_Shmey I agree, Elizabeth Olsen's role as a villain is great, it really fits that actor/character
[0:49:36] Blexun: antman is definitely better than average IMO
[0:50:55] rich16bit: Plot device scripting out human interaction
[0:51:08] Iamdenril: eternals was garbage
[0:51:09] AinzN: Eternals ijpKEK
[0:51:15] ZeoBishop: iron man 3 is better that is why KEKW
[0:51:15] DyingEros: 27
[0:51:16] Stormmaggeddon: KEKW
[0:51:17] Iamdenril: not one of them is likeable in that film
[0:51:17] pc2400: Iron man 3 is good
[0:51:18] Sir_Myrmidon: how did Eternals beat out Captain Marvel?
[0:51:21] tkcross21: eternals should be bottom tier. maybe even lower than hulk.
[0:51:21] Toscacake: i still haven't seen it LUL
[0:51:21] shadowoflight_: ? that's a silly question
[0:51:25] DyingEros: It is so fricking bad
[0:51:28] qdazzarus: it sucks even more
[0:51:28] Rednexi5: how is Eternals as high as it is?
[0:51:28] geonoxes: How did eternal beat Captain Marvel?
[0:51:33] EvilBuho: I feel like Black Widow should be much higher than what it is
[0:51:35] WDForty: Eternals was just ok-ish, not horrible bad, but just ok
[0:51:41] Hagaroth: Eternals is the least rewatchable movie after black widow
[0:51:43] leovic1: KEKW
[0:51:44] shadowoflight_: I'm surprised eternals is not 26-28
[0:51:44] m3rcer: KEKW
[0:51:45] reboot2099: Eternals should be in LAST. Yes, ETarnals is worst than Thor 2.
[0:51:47] Hyper_Remy: LUL
[0:51:48] SpaceDive: wait what LUL
[0:51:50] Acheron13: Wrist sun dials
[0:51:51] leovic1: ancient wrist sundial
[0:51:55] LeelandGrant: wrist sundials?

[0:52:00] WDForty: that was sign language developed by aliens tho
[0:52:05] WDForty: lol
[0:52:05] Stormmaggeddon: I think eternals could get pushed all the way to the bottom LUL
[0:52:08] Killercds: I'm just super salty that WandaVision was supposed to give Wanda character growth with processing her grief.... but then Strange MoM basically said JK she learned absolutely nothing
[0:52:08] p00pouri: eternals is literally just boring its not bad
[0:52:12] ControllerZen: I enjoyed Eternals
[0:52:17] BobbiTheDragon: i didnt like black widow at all
[0:52:18] mob1900: modRe modKt
[0:52:28] Iamdenril: everyone in eternals is an asshole in their own way

[0:52:53] Ravnim: @DD_The_Shmey I liked their redemption arc in that movie, but having her have no reason to be evil than an emotional/irrational one sucks
[0:52:55] KatjeMauw: omg
[0:52:56] p00pouri: Black Widow sucked it ruined taskmaster
[0:52:59] OmarKhaledBadr: Fuck what they did to Taskmaster in that movie

[0:53:57] BobbiTheDragon: i gonna have a lord of the rings marathon with friends on my vacation
[0:54:17] DD_The_Shmey: @Ravnim she had so little screen time for development throughout the main movies, I remember when they announced Wanda Vision I was like "oh finally, we get to know what her story is and why she is so cool and deserves to be one of the members of the avengers" but instead we got an in depth story about her being super powerful and dealing with grief in an unhealthy way. I never really got a good read on her character motivations because she wasn't quite right in the head during wanda vision
[0:54:23] SpaceDive: thats a good thing in a way
[0:54:32] Ravnim: @DD_The_Shmey sir pls

[0:58:06] Ravnim: @DD_The_Shmey yea, but acting wise I'd like to see more of her, she was great in Wandavision
[0:58:09] SpaceDive: yeah now way home is lower for me

[1:06:34] Sir_Myrmidon: woah, hey now
[1:06:35] JWoody82: hard disagree
[1:06:36] SpaceDive: black widow last yeah
[1:06:37] yunggoon1: What
[1:06:39] Reckless_Rob: Eternals is absolute dog trash
[1:06:40] crzymike: oh
[1:06:42] EvilBuho: The official rankings is bad
[1:06:43] twitchymctroll: NOPERS
[1:06:45] Voidruner: Eternals is better than Black Widow, that 1/2 half of BW was baaaad
[1:06:46] Haeher: NO
[1:06:47] the_ch0: OMEGALUL
[1:06:48] leovic1: ijpKEK
[1:06:49] akmannen: dr strange 2 isnt ageing well either Sadge

[1:06:51] EvoCaliber: LUL
[1:06:52] Legionnare92: black widow is just inconsequential?
[1:06:53] DyingEros: THE MAN IN THE GODDAMN OCEAN
[1:06:54] Hyper_Remy: LUL
[1:06:55] OmarKhaledBadr: So true LUL
[1:06:56] shadowoflight_: black widow is SO MUCH better than eternals
[1:06:56] tkcross21: and every week Jesse is right
[1:06:56] QConsolidated: Black Widow was better than Eternals for sure
[1:06:58] Voidruner: they are close tho
[1:07:00] BlueSapphyre: the second half of black widow is so bad.
[1:07:01] WDForty: @itmeJP FYI User submission for MCUTV won't let you change order of stuff
[1:07:01] MagnaCarter_: Eternals has barely been out, if it hasn't aged well AT THIS POINT
[1:07:04] DD_The_Shmey: eh yeah eternals didnt age well, black widow is better
[1:07:05] Ceaseless_: i say shang chi #1 because they did something great with a new character while spiderman is just more spiderman at the end of the day
[1:07:05] Zrmi: Black Widow was at least half a good movie
[1:07:12] demigod791: BW did not age well the only reason that movie is fun is Florence Pugh
[1:07:14] reboot2099: In Black Widow, there are at least fun charactewrs. NOBODY in Eternals are fun. It's just boring
[1:07:24] shadowoflight_: the man in the ocean is too small, it's not to scale, if you really want to argue
[1:07:24] muthan: Eternals didnt age because its Eternal LUL
[1:07:26] Reckless_Rob: Well...its easy to overlook Kappa
[1:07:36] OmarKhaledBadr: LUL
[1:07:43] Falc1979: Eternals tries to be too epic and cocks it up massively
[1:07:52] sotasty_: but black widow has yelena
[1:07:57] kazen01: it was a good first half
[1:07:59] m3rcer: @Ceaseless_ gotta say yeah while i had fun with the movie i didnt really get hyped until i saw those 2 characters tru the portal
[1:08:02] Affly01: First 45 minutes are ScarJo being invincible
[1:08:27] Falc1979: Black Widow is kinda good brainless 80's fun action.
[1:08:49] Legionnare92: what about show rankings?
[1:08:54] Reckless_Rob: Black Widow isnt pure bad
[1:08:58] IthnanCryo: You guys did phase 1 to 3 before the main list i believe
[1:09:04] Crafteroon: Phases were ranked within the phase, the overall was overall, so changes happened.
[1:09:08] BarryCarlyon: Yeah I don't think the crew did phases just overall. And I aded phase 4 for everyone today. Since have enough films for it to be sensible
[1:09:20] Fetko1: black widow was way more entertaining than eternals
[1:09:22] EvilBuho: That makes no sense to me lol
[1:09:40] TribalSage: Spiderman No Way Home, Doctor Strange 2, Black Widow, Shang Chi, Eternals.
[1:09:42] SpaceDive: do a phase ranking
[1:09:45] noMaDNINe: this is not hard jp .. just drag eternals and drop it on 5 :-
[1:09:45] Falc1979: But they failed in making Eternals.
[1:09:50] Reckless_Rob: @BarryCarlyon Which one is your favorite? Of all movies
[1:09:53] reboot2099: Just rank movies on if you like it in a vacuum, not if it's important or ambitious
[1:10:01] BarryCarlyon: @BarryCarlyon ragnarok
[1:10:10] OmarKhaledBadr: Alexi
[1:10:10] pc2400: Salma and Jolie characters are so bad written
[1:10:15] LeelandGrant: if eternals plays 10 years in the future of the other mcu movies, does that makes the movie better?
[1:10:16] geonoxes: That almost makes Eternals worse
[1:10:18] yrvengalied: Red Guardian
[1:10:20] the_ch0: NODDERS
[1:10:21] yrvengalied: NODDERS
[1:10:22] DD_The_Shmey: YES!!
[1:10:23] Reckless_Rob: @BarryCarlyon Ah nice
[1:10:26] Hyper_Remy: Fax
[1:10:30] DD_The_Shmey: ijpNODDERS
[1:10:35] Blexun: but Red Guardian became kind of a joke towards the end of the movie
[1:10:38] Iamdenril: None of the eternals are likeable in anyway
[1:10:49] Iamdenril: gilgamesh maybe
[1:10:52] DD_The_Shmey: Jesse spitting facts now
[1:10:55] twitchymctroll: NODDERS
[1:10:56] Voidruner: True, but that BW ending was rly bad tho
[1:10:57] ReginaldXIV: Florence Pugh and Hailee Steinfeld are the future of the MCU
[1:10:57] Iamdenril: but otherwise none of them
[1:11:04] Affly01: The only fun eternals were killed saddly
[1:11:06] Ravnim: NODDERS yes
[1:11:08] Reckless_Rob: I mean she pulls that movie to another level
[1:11:15] Iamdenril: @Affly01 YES
[1:11:17] LeelandGrant: but the second half of black widow was so bad, it pulls down the first half
[1:11:24] Voidruner: Give Florence and Hailee their own show!
[1:11:42] DD_The_Shmey: which one was gilgamesh? was that the indian sidekick guy?, he was cool @Iamdenril
[1:11:45] muthan: i still think in Eternals it was not about the characters. Its rather MCU pantheon lore building.
[1:11:58] Falc1979: So the MCU is playing football - and Eternals is trying the be the stadium the MCU plays on - and messes it up... which is why it's the worst thing in the MCU
[1:12:00] noMaDNINe: eternals 5 .. jp !doit
[1:12:04] Iamdenril: @DD_The_Shmey gilgamesh was the punchy guy looking after thena
[1:12:16] Sir_Myrmidon: But.. there _are_ good parts of black widow. Eternals.... ?
[1:12:17] Falc1979: to
[1:12:21] Voidruner: they did taskmaster so dirty
[1:12:24] Meis122: It ruined taskmaster
[1:12:26] ReginaldXIV: Madge
[1:12:30] Acheron13: "Above the radar"
[1:12:31] OmarKhaledBadr: o7 Taskmaster
[1:12:35] shadowoflight_: taskmaster was so dumb
[1:12:38] Nobiont: @DD_The_Shmey gilgamesh was the big korean guy
[1:12:38] reboot2099: But I would start Eternals and stop after the 30 first seconds... LUL
[1:12:40] p00pouri: Black Widow is the worst movie its worse than Hulk
[1:12:43] pc2400: They can bring Taskmaster from other universe now
[1:12:49] DD_The_Shmey: ahh yeah @Iamdenril , he made a promise to watch after the crazy one
[1:12:52] LeelandGrant: Eternals had some HYPE optics
[1:12:57] TribalSage: Black Widow was better than Eternals and Shang Chi
[1:12:57] EvilBuho: Black Widow is better no question ask.
[1:12:58] Voidruner: eternals was rly mid, but they had important lore and the movie looked better
[1:12:59] 23Thijs: fight scenes were cool in eternals
[1:13:04] walternatorz: I like the idea of eternals.
[1:13:21] Juvar23: first live MCU crew pog
[1:13:22] demigod791: at least Eternals is pretty to look at XD
[1:13:22] p00pouri: finger guns
[1:13:23] OmarKhaledBadr: Also fuck earth, who cares if all humans die
[1:13:24] p00pouri: lol
[1:13:33] p00pouri: finger guns is the only thing that was fun in eternals
[1:13:42] profnesbitt: I still love that had a realistic choice.
[1:13:42] oPH0EN1Xo: see....i know im minority but i enjoyed eternals. yes they stuffed too many characters that most people know nothing about into a movie together but i enjoyed it
[1:13:48] oPH0EN1Xo: i like the combat
[1:13:48] Affly01: but the Ikaris and Makkari fight was cool
[1:13:51] SKEWR13: Man in the ocean…
[1:13:51] Iamdenril: he's chosen not to give a shit about anyone thus choosing a side
[1:13:52] DD_The_Shmey: ijpNODDERS  lets move eternals down a rank
[1:13:55] 23Thijs: he didnt want to fight ikaris because he adores him
[1:13:59] TribalSage: Why are you including the Disney+ shows? They are part of the MCU phases.
[1:14:00] Voidruner: it's close
[1:14:01] PathfinderSC2: Eternals is visually 10x the movie that Black Widow is... its arguably one of the best looking films in the MCU??
[1:14:08] the_ch0: KEKW
[1:14:09] TribalSage: Arent*
[1:14:18] noMaDNINe: jp wtf .. 5 doit .. dont think .. doit
[1:14:22] Voidruner: Eternals were stunning visually, agreed
[1:14:27] AinzN: TribalSage the shows have their own list
[1:14:33] geonoxes: This phase is kinda a mess huh?
[1:14:34] a_fly1ng_m0nkey: "If you choose not to choose, you still have made a choice" -Rush
[1:14:35] Radcosh: spoilers D:
[1:14:36] Killercds: Kumail Nanjianis character never took the time the listen to the lyrics to Tom Sawyer by Rush
[1:14:40] Jungle_jims99: But @itmejp Black Widow at least doesn’t have a scene of Icarus flying into the sun
[1:14:44] oPH0EN1Xo: i legit love how they handled mikari's powers in the game. handled a speedster way better than DC ever does with the flash
[1:14:48] p00pouri: Eternals is a steady ok movie
[1:14:49] MagnaCarter_: killing Selma Hayek was a dumb choice
[1:14:54] Falc1979: Angelina played Angelina in Eternals :-D
[1:14:57] demigod791: this Phase is by far my least favorite i really havent liked any of them XD
[1:14:58] EvilBuho: Noo
[1:15:01] DaRandalizer: too many characters for one film
[1:15:03] TribalSage: Most of the Disney+ shows are better than Eternals
[1:15:03] profnesbitt: There are people like that though. Anybody ever seen a family issue turn physical has seen someone refuse to get involved even to break it up because they don’t want to fight family fully knowing one person will beat the other.
[1:15:11] DD_The_Shmey: yeah, @PathfinderSC2 it's amazing that they had all that budget and all that gorgeous visual affects, and a great cast of characters, but still the movie was so bad
[1:15:12] geonoxes: The bad guy was superman
[1:15:13] PathfinderSC2: Also the Eternals soundtrack is brilliant. Just the Makkari speedster track is one of the best Marvel has had
[1:15:19] WDForty: to me Eternals was ok all through out, Black Widow was pretty decent, and then turns bad, so they both average out
[1:15:19] Falc1979: NO
[1:15:21] OmarKhaledBadr: The celestials look awesome
[1:15:23] crzymike: no
[1:15:23] reboot2099: IT's mind blowing how boring the characters in Eternals are but ALL the actors are top tiers! How do you make boring characters with those actors??\
[1:15:23] the_ch0: NOPERS
[1:15:24] Voidruner: It's really close
[1:15:24] MrDigitalCypher: they are not debating 5th place between BW and eternals?
[1:15:26] Fetko1: no
[1:15:31] twitchymctroll: no
[1:15:33] a_fly1ng_m0nkey: LMAO
[1:15:40] noMaDNINe: thats not the question wtf
[1:15:48] camino_elpandajerk: Eternals is cinematic tofu
[1:15:50] noMaDNINe: eternals 5 done
[1:15:59] SpaceDive: ironman 1 still holds up
[1:16:15] Fetko1: tony stark built the couch too
[1:16:17] WDForty: i'm comfortable with the current ranking
[1:16:21] profnesbitt: Generally my answer is I rank something that is polarizing higher than something that is meh.
[1:16:23] Ravnim: that man in the ocean!
[1:16:24] Killercds: Yeah, the suit turned on Noclip
[1:16:27] sotasty_: yelena matters ijpMAD
[1:16:32] camino_elpandajerk: Vibranium couch
[1:16:35] MrDigitalCypher: The Gaint in the ocean!
[1:16:36] Iamdenril: things in eternals where supposed to matter but... didnt
[1:16:39] m3rcer: i mean no one mentioned the man in the ocean so......
[1:16:46] EvilBuho: Yelena and Red Guardian should be enough to make it better
[1:16:49] p00pouri: Black Widow was literally worse than the Hulk movie straight up
[1:16:49] Crafteroon: Eternals is the Revenant, while Black Widow is The Martian. One is more fun, the other won best picture.
[1:16:55] 23Thijs: you cant expect things to pay off in the very next movie everytime
[1:16:57] PathfinderSC2: Also Jesse is forgetting that Jon Snow is going to fly to the moon with Blade... so there's that
[1:16:58] WDForty: i don't think you can rank phase 4 yet cause phase 4 isn't even close to done yet
[1:17:01] ThePointGaming: @itmeJP chances on them pulling an Age of Ultron with Eternals? aka making it a bigger deal than it is now
[1:17:04] DD_The_Shmey: I think there is a 50-50 chance that they just retcon Eternals out of the MCU
[1:17:05] OmarKhaledBadr: Hawkeye
[1:17:07] LeelandGrant: You sure about that?
[1:17:09] reboot2099: Dudes, stop saying a movie is better because it matters. It should be "do you enjoy the movie? yes or no" not "is it important?"
[1:17:10] TheLegendReborn: does setting up with exposition make it a movie that actually is good though? setting up with exposition doesn't make something good
[1:17:11] Iamdenril: SOME MENTION OF THE GIANT MAN IN THE SEA
[1:17:16] 1sttimelurker: Eternals should be bottom
[1:17:30] Ravnim: COPIUM mcu will stick to the comics
[1:17:32] Voidruner: I feel like Eternals will be the Age of Ultron of this phase LUL
[1:17:32] DD_The_Shmey: I would be competely fine if Eternals was retconned out of MCU cannon
[1:17:37] MrSiege: What’s worse though mobius or eternals (even though it isn’t MCU)
[1:17:38] WDForty: Krakoa
[1:18:30] Blexun: literal space giant
[1:18:33] noMaDNINe: eternal bottom .. the show :-
[1:18:39] yodelrodel: Fantastic Four will be main as they move towards Secret Wars
[1:18:46] m3rcer: that sword still there btw
[1:18:48] Voidruner: What sword? Kappa
[1:18:54] EvilBuho: Sword? What ya talking about
[1:18:58] BigTheDave: Eternals is the Ashenvale Sword lol
[1:19:07] Falc1979: YEP!
[1:19:08] kazen01: they havent said anything about an eternals 2 right?
[1:19:11] Blexun: hand was on the news too
[1:19:12] shadowoflight_: To me, the man in the ocean is too small. More like island sized instead of planet sized.
[1:19:13] itmeBOT:  Come hang out in the Sub Only Discord chat, just sync your Twitch account with your Discord account. You can find info on linking Twitch to discord at https://itme.jp/discord

[1:19:18] xelan_star: magic
[1:19:19] Grond_: KKona DUH
[1:19:23] MrDigitalCypher: dimension phasing....
[1:19:28] Aurugorn: it's like a cork
[1:19:30] p00pouri: eternals set the way for a thamos revival and redemption arc in the future
[1:19:35] shadowoflight_: the lava is the yolk
[1:19:38] JusticetoAll: is that the beauty of the multiverse now though? just throw "Eternals" into a non 616 multiverse
[1:19:40] Falc1979: Well yes
[1:19:48] profnesbitt: Are they going to do secret wars and secret invasion because as an extreme MCU fan and barely casual comic fan those two things sound identical?
[1:19:50] DD_The_Shmey: Even if the hand wasn't there in the ocean... what about the Giant "Show me What You Got" head appearing in the sky above everyone, judging the people of earth while everybody turns to look up at the head
[1:19:52] OmarKhaledBadr: Jon Snow thinks he's going to fight a celestial with a magic sword LUL
[1:19:53] BigTheDave: Three Mile Island
[1:19:54] Iamdenril: @p00pouri did it!? please explain!?
[1:20:03] Wholemane: Jon Snow saying "I love you Cersei." LMAO
[1:20:13] PathfinderSC2: I mean we say all this but The Blip would have ended life on earth and literally no one mentions the economic or social impact after Endgame
[1:20:14] zzNamttamzz: Maybe it's below radar
[1:20:15] jnkgamer: The same way no one talks about Gotg 2 where ego was taking over multiple planets. That was never spoken about again
[1:20:16] a_fly1ng_m0nkey: Jon snow on the case, we're in good hands
[1:20:18] Seansky33: See i will never forgive marvel for allowing Black Widow to be a phase 4 film so it is 5 for me
[1:20:27] Aurugorn: LUL
[1:20:28] yunggoon1: atpRtsd
[1:20:28] Crafteroon: Changing the giant into stone should have crumbled the whole thing under the ocean.
[1:20:31] demigod791: its above the radar XD
[1:20:31] p00pouri: @Iamdenril well if eternals can be remade and his brother is an eternal its canon they can revive him and he won't have mad weiry or however you spell it
[1:20:32] Falc1979: It wouldn't
[1:20:35] LeelandGrant: Magic LUL
[1:20:35] andiago: its way bigger than i remember KEKW
[1:20:39] kazen01: the displaced water lol
[1:20:40] wanderingman: magic
[1:20:47] SpaceDive: RIP Earth
[1:20:50] Hagaroth: That's like 6 time everest
[1:20:52] Sonatta: that's global devastation... worse than Death Wing
[1:20:54] Sir_Myrmidon: jets would fly through his fingers
[1:21:03] Falc1979: tsunami <------ ????
[1:21:06] Craylith: @PathfinderSC2 That's what Falcon and Winter Soldier was all about.
[1:21:08] crzymike: that is a continent
[1:21:08] WDForty: the scale is really messed up cause they show them standing on the hand and it doesn't look as big
[1:21:10] shadowoflight_: hmm. yea same
[1:21:11] ashla11: dudes head is like 100km tall
[1:21:12] LeelandGrant: Higest mountain on earth
[1:21:13] Iamdenril: @p00pouri true but i dont think they're gunna re-use thanos at least anytime soon if they did at all
[1:21:13] m3rcer: just the earth flood alone
[1:21:14] geonoxes: more mass than everst out of nowhere
[1:21:18] SiegeMeister: Jessi finally vindicated
[1:21:22] ZemogJr: Isn’t there another shot where it’s way smaller?
[1:21:23] Crafteroon: The hand alone is above the radar! @itmeJP
[1:21:25] QConsolidated: inb4 it turns out Eternals doesn't take place in 616
[1:21:32] Blexun: if we learned later that Atlanta prevented massive damage would you accept it
[1:21:32] profnesbitt: Wait what body part did they fight on then? Because they weren’t in the clouds
[1:21:34] jnkgamer: The same way no one talks about Gotg 2 where ego was taking over multiple planets. That was never spoken about again
[1:21:35] Falc1979: Billions - all of them!
[1:21:37] m3rcer: oh yeah its above radar thats true
[1:21:37] 23Thijs: water went down to replace the space the celestial vacated in the center of the earth?
[1:21:38] Blexun: Atlantis
[1:21:44] p00pouri: @Iamdenril well if they go for a fight against the celestials they will need more powerful people to help fight so its possible
[1:21:50] Affly01: there is no more India if he's like 100 km tall
[1:21:50] MrMoogleberry: "it took place in another universe" marvel
[1:21:52] a_fly1ng_m0nkey: it's so weird to me when people do this, where they are ok with superhuman but then all other physics need to be realistic.
[1:21:56] tyriaan: it's because it's REALLY high up
[1:21:56] Zrmi: even in Europe, The Netherlands is below sea level LUL
[1:21:59] PathfinderSC2: @craylith but it wasn't really, because the only thing they mention is displaced people. What I'm saying is the global economy would have collapsed in those 5 years... not just some people being homeless after
[1:22:00] BigTheDave: The Waves are 3 miles high
[1:22:01] reboot2099: Yes, that was what I was tyoing, water and clouds don t  match up
[1:22:02] EvilBuho: Just FYI clouds are usually lower when near water
[1:22:05] m3rcer: Eternals is in 617 guys its okay
[1:22:05] Imbadyoureworse: its into space
[1:22:13] SiegeMeister: Doesn't seem like there's enough distance from the water to the clouds
[1:22:14] Imbadyoureworse: its a low orbit finger tip
[1:22:15] Falc1979: ALSO! That hand: Free space elevator! :-D
[1:22:15] JusticetoAll: Those waves are the size of mountains
[1:22:16] Bloodfire212: yeah the sense of scale is pretty fucky
[1:22:21] JBfromAccounting: this is from like 7 miles up so this thing is god damn HUGE
[1:22:22] Freezetrap: you can see the curvature of the earth in this image XD
[1:22:24] DD_The_Shmey: the water level rising due to global warming = 1 meter, the water level rising due to ocean hand+head = 50 meters
[1:22:32] Imbadyoureworse: the tsunamis from this thing
[1:22:33] oPinger: if it fully emerged the earth would be a yoke sack on its waist, earth is gone
[1:22:33] shadowoflight_: actually our atmosphere is very, very thin
[1:22:34] oldmangamer1974: Clouds or steam from the heat of it
[1:22:38] Legionnare92: those ripples are bigger than any tsunami to happen on earth lol
[1:22:40] profnesbitt: Would you hate it or love it if they open Pandora’s box and say that eternals occurred in a different universe?
[1:22:41] Iamdenril: @p00pouri man celestials are a serious threat i dont think we will see anything to do with them before kang at the very least
[1:22:43] Sonatta: it's reaching into spac e
[1:22:44] Kewnst: this dwarfs mounteverest.
[1:22:44] ashla11: @shadowoflight_ this is so true
[1:22:46] kingofgames726: best one hour show i ever watched
[1:22:51] rich16bit: its like in space
[1:22:56] CptArimus: like, that means that hand is easily over 300,000 feet tall
[1:22:56] DaRandalizer: look at the vortex around the head
[1:23:00] ThemDemo: To be fair the atmosphere is extremely thin on earth compared to earths diameter

[1:23:13] Craylith: @PathfinderSC2 I mean they talk about the economical, societal and political impacts. How borders suddenly didn´t matter anymore. How people started working together more.

[1:23:30] demigod791: see this bothers me but like the guy in space is a fucking thing XD
[1:23:30] Affly01: >As Weta Digital VFX supervisor Matt Aitken tells us, Tiamut—the Celestial born from the Earth's core in Eternals—is a whopping 300 miles tall from head to his feet.
[1:23:30] MrDigitalCypher: think about the land rush to by property
[1:23:32] ShadowlessFiend: Valle
[1:23:33] MikeTsa7: ijpKEK
[1:23:34] Holrend: so there is a hole in the ground where the things come out?
[1:23:41] noMaDNINe: 5 @itmeJP ijpHAPPY_HF
[1:23:43] Huffshee: so much of the world would be under water if this hapened
[1:23:47] Imbadyoureworse: yea jesse is right lol
[1:23:57] Falc1979: The amount of energy pushed into the water by this - the US would have been wiped out too
[1:24:03] Imbadyoureworse: but hear me out jesse: MAYBE this wasnt 616
[1:24:04] ShadowlessFiend: Also the ocean isn't so deep
[1:24:12] WDForty: we've already found out how this plays out (see COVID)
[1:24:14] PathfinderSC2: Never realised I was an Eternals defender until this episode hasSadge
[1:24:15] ワフルデラ: why would you speak english in india Kappa
[1:24:16] shadowoflight_: LUL
[1:24:16] OmarKhaledBadr: 2 days later a bigger dude appeared in the sky LUL
[1:24:17] DD_The_Shmey: @ThemDemo hahahahaha, its funny that... the fact that we are having the conversation of how thick the atmosphere is, really highlights how ridiculously big that hand is
[1:24:25] AinzN: Jammies You are my Horizon! Jammies
[1:24:26] p00pouri: This is a hollow earth theory earth so the water doesn't create a tsunami it goes into the drain no?
[1:24:27] m3rcer: NODDERS
[1:24:27] yrvengalied: give em the Hand

[1:24:36] Wedrikul: OMEGALUL
[1:24:40] camino_elpandajerk: On the plus side, we could launch rockets into space with much less fuel if we launched from his index finger
[1:24:42] PrimordialDilemma: LUL
[1:24:46] Killercds: To see the arc of the earths horizon like that it haas to be a minimum of like 50,000 ft above sea-level
[1:24:47] MikeTsa7: ijpKEK
[1:24:54] PathfinderSC2: and by that measure Black Widow is worse
[1:24:55] SpaceDive: so massive you couldn't even tell what it is
[1:25:00] OmarKhaledBadr: I got you
[1:25:04] Zrmi: it's a celestial avatar though
[1:25:05] ShadowlessFiend: How deep is the ocean ?
[1:25:13] Ardentfoxx0017: Didnt in the movie they say the eternals "energy,lifeforce, whatever" was spent to save the planet from devastation or some such hand waving reason for why nothing apocalyptic happend
[1:25:14] ThePointGaming: the Celestial coming to earth would have caused such Chaos on its own
[1:25:18] frenzalitis: "Show me what you got"
[1:25:18] kasded: KEKW
[1:25:19] Falc1979: I would RATHER rewatch the last season of Game of Thrones than Eternals!

[1:25:35] GlasMondTV: Move Eternals to 6!
[1:25:36] TheRhymenoceros: Southern hemisphere 100% just saw Celestial crotch
[1:25:41] Xanctius: @itmeJP About the statue size: According to Eternals VFX supervisor Matt Aitken, Tiamut is about 500 km tall; however, the size can change depending on the scene.
[1:25:41] profnesbitt: He was more translucent than I remembered.
[1:25:46] 23Thijs: YES do AoS!!!
[1:25:50] Voidruner: AoS was great after s1, s1 is trash tho
[1:26:20] Ravnim: DrS2 is better than ShangChi imo
[1:26:20] shadowoflight_: AoS was so saturday morning cartoon, couldn't stand after end of season 1
[1:26:21] Hagaroth: Type Arishem
[1:26:23] Zrmi: Knowhere is huge and just the head
[1:26:28] DyingEros: so like 20k feet tall? Thats cool
[1:26:29] p00pouri: AoS is so good, then terrible then ends pretty good
[1:26:31] Sir_Myrmidon: 500km tall... the ISS is lower than that?
[1:26:33] Voidruner: You can skip s1 of AoS and nothing would change
[1:26:35] SiegeMeister: How big is that in real world miles?
[1:26:55] dahak777: Apparently ISS orbits at 408 km
[1:26:58] ItsTheChops: Thats twice the distance to the moon
[1:26:59] Crafteroon: @SiegeMeister about 2570 bicycles tall.
[1:27:00] uzling: 310 miles ish
[1:27:00] Falc1979: LOL from that picture the gap between the hand and his head is more than 500 Km
[1:27:03] PathfinderSC2: it's definitely shown as bigger than 500km
[1:27:11] DyingEros: ISS is only 480km @itmeJP
[1:27:12] DyingEros: Bruh
[1:27:12] m3rcer: hand of god shit
[1:27:22] m3rcer: like that one game with the angry dude too angry to die fighting gods
[1:27:25] Iamdenril: he doesnt reach to earth he pulls the eternals towards him
[1:27:25] untimely27: dude has his on gravity
[1:27:25] WDForty: didn't he just teleport them to his hand and didn't reach down??
[1:27:45] twitchymctroll: this movie hurt my brain so much it ranks below thor 2 for me
[1:27:47] EvilBuho: The shockwaves
[1:27:50] spideycsa: that is a baby celestial compared to a developed one
[1:27:51] profnesbitt: Hang on. They show the way people on earth see him though and he is hard to see. His eyes and an outline are it.
[1:27:51] SpaceDive: wouldn't it change the earths orbit
[1:27:56] ApathyOwl: that city is gone KEKW
[1:28:07] Iamdenril: i believe thats a vision that gif
[1:28:12] PathfinderSC2: I mean if we're going to worry about the physics, we might as well not watch Phase 4 NotLikeThis
[1:28:12] Grond_: amazing looking , put it back on 4 LuL
[1:28:13] bairdman: Oooh back to me question during the pre show, what about Ego? He’s not really a celestial right
[1:28:13] MagnaCarter_: there was a city RIGHT THERE?! That's a lot of dead folk
[1:28:14] SiegeMeister: @Crafteroon What about cats-per-square-ironing-board?
[1:28:15] Hagaroth: The city would also lose the city
[1:28:16] Iamdenril: tiamut was in the sea
[1:28:27] wicknap: @RyGuy_ The earth would spin out of orbit, yes. lol
[1:28:29] a_fly1ng_m0nkey: So to get this right.  He's ok with this guy existing but is caught up on the physics not being correct.
[1:28:30] dahak777: Man.. the more this is talked about the more Earth should not be here at all
[1:28:47] Freezetrap: I think the only thing significant about the Eternals movie is that it sets up why Earth will be a primary place of importance in the universe for the rest of the MCU when they bring in more cosmic stuff
[1:28:53] ashla11: does arishem live forever unlike other celestials that run out of fuel?  I never got that part of the movie
[1:29:01] ApathyOwl: @RyGuy_ LUL
[1:29:15] Crafteroon: They are celestials, so one would assume they nullify their own gravitational forces when near planets, otherwise some big waves would occur.
[1:29:22] noMaDNINe: eternals : beyond
[1:29:34] OmarKhaledBadr: SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT! LUL
[1:29:39] ItsTheChops: show me what you've got
[1:29:52] ApathyOwl: @OmarKhaledBadr beat me to it KEKW
[1:30:00] PathfinderSC2: Literally none of the physics in the MCU makes sense, even Iron Man 1 makes no sense
[1:30:02] Sonatta: especially if everyone knows Captain American and Tony Stark are dead
[1:30:03] Blexun: imagine living in the southern hemisphere and all you see is giant red space schlong
[1:30:03] Wedrikul: if they said "sup" the sound shockwave would strip earth of atmosphere
[1:30:16] Seansky33: what do you mean chaos would have already happened when half the world was snapped
[1:30:18] Affly01: it was hilarious how in the post credit scene people start running the moment Charlize Theron opens the portal
[1:30:23] SabertoothEwok: Granted that would have happened in the snap too
[1:30:26] Zrmi: there are humans on this earth that can blow up everything with just a button...
[1:30:34] SabertoothEwok: There would be no society when half the population goes poof
[1:30:37] Seansky33: This is just more par for the course.
[1:30:49] OmarKhaledBadr: @RyGuy_ It's cause he mentioned the council of Ricks LUL
[1:31:05] CptArimus: imagine being the people at the equator who are staring at Arishem's junk
[1:31:07] Wholemane: Its such a cool picture tho... So ominous
[1:31:07] BlazeRom: they should just scrap a universe
[1:31:09] Zrmi: I really need Galactus in the MCU
[1:31:18] A1rbanas: I though only she could see that, not everyone?
[1:31:19] Aurugorn: so what does the other side of the earth see LUL
[1:31:19] noMaDNINe: imagine the people in the south :-
[1:31:28] Gregoryturtle: Are these invisible to normal people like the monsters in Moon Knight were?
[1:32:09] OmarKhaledBadr: LUL
[1:32:17] Hagaroth: I mean that guy dropped his bike in the park
[1:32:21] Iamdenril: celestial crotch
[1:32:24] PathfinderSC2: There are many bad things about the Eternals but the physics are really not the issue given the whole MCU
[1:32:26] BlazeRom: ShOw Me WhAt YoU GoT
[1:32:31] MagnaCarter_: big ol' celestial dick in Australia
[1:32:31] Falc1979: Celestial dong in Australia!
[1:32:33] Ravnim: Also the Giant dead santa in Rick and Morty
[1:32:33] BlazeRom: does the Celestial have genitals ?
[1:32:36] Blexun: Celestials Ken Doll
[1:32:42] kazen01: we got a stone core now right
[1:32:44] camino_elpandajerk: The butt hemisphere
[1:32:45] twitchymctroll: celestial balls not recommended
[1:32:55] JBfromAccounting: Florida GONE
[1:32:59] bogidude17: And Australia would see the crotch upside down
[1:33:01] BlazeRom: is the moon and the earth the celestials balls ?
[1:33:03] spideycsa: celestial have cosmic altering powers though
[1:33:03] TheSteelWizard09: All of this shows that Eternals is way too high on the normal list.
[1:33:11] walternatorz: the mass was always there in the world, it likely didn't change much
[1:33:14] Aurugorn: they obviously based watches on that sign
[1:33:15] WDForty: well he can teleport using some sort of gravity well, so you can write off him not impacting the planet by getting earth, but there's only so much you can give
[1:33:19] Kagutsuchiii: ijpNODDERS
[1:33:19] Stormmaggeddon: There really is no defending this movie
[1:33:27] Zrmi: maybe they borrowed some logic from Roland Emmerich
[1:33:29] ashla11: we should all sit down and talk about ironman and how he would be turned into paste every time he flies in his armor the way they show him do it
[1:33:32] OmarKhaledBadr: He invented the atom bomb shortly afterwards LUL
[1:33:35] dabthirty: In the comics celestial are big but are they the size of planets?
[1:33:36] ZemogJr: I mean.  Do we assume the laws of physics apply to beings larger than a planet?
[1:33:39] Wedrikul: gravity is a physical concept that HAS to work in any sci-fi or fantasy since otherwise anything would cease to exist
[1:33:40] WDForty: *write off him impacting the planet's gravity
[1:33:45] PathfinderSC2: @ashla11 YES! Thank you
[1:33:58] WDForty: they are at least trying new things
[1:34:03] Falc1979: Phase 4 is supposed to be all over the place
[1:34:05] ReginaldXIV: Feels like a messier phase 1
[1:34:07] BlazeRom: @ZemogJr i mean, it should right ? but then again this is comics so they break physics all the time
[1:34:10] Legionnare92: how do you rank the shows stripHmm
[1:34:14] d1stract10n: they are lost without RDJ
[1:34:17] WDForty: it's better than constantly doing the same thing over and over again, they are experimenting with new stuff
[1:34:18] ZemogJr: That said.  Love this show.
[1:34:19] LuckyNumber: @Falc1979 it is supposed to be bad 4Head
[1:34:24] Crafteroon: Yeah, Celestials must nullify their own gravitational effects near planets. They only wanted to test the Noah scenario once or twice.
[1:34:26] BlazeRom: they are going way too over the top
[1:34:30] reboot2099: Phase 4 has the best and the worst movie of the whole MCU
[1:34:33] A1rbanas: "with great power comes great responsibility"
[1:34:34] Blexun: Marvel usually has an Act 3 issue
[1:34:34] Freezetrap: A big critcism of MCU movies has always been the 3rd act, same for the TV shows
[1:34:44] Falc1979: @LuckyNumber No but they need something for phase 5 to "fix"
[1:34:46] akmannen: yeah the CGI fights at the end
[1:34:56] SabertoothEwok: Its actually how they write scripts cause its how Iron man was done
[1:35:11] demigod791: NWH has a bad ending to me as well XD but i also dislike that movie a lot
[1:35:11] Devlind: no way home was so boring at times, fell asleep watching it. Shang Chi was pretty good I think
[1:35:13] CptArimus: TBH, the only landing outside the big ones that stuck well for me was Dr. Strange 1 - because it isnt a big battle but a smart negotiation
[1:35:18] SabertoothEwok: they start working before its done and then finish script as they film
[1:35:24] PathfinderSC2: Phase 1 all had weak endings bar the Avengers
[1:35:26] profnesbitt: Honestly I’m tired of the super fights and find them to be the least interesting part of the MCU movies at this point. That’s why I liked moon knight so much.
[1:35:31] LuckyNumber: @Falc1979 i mean phase 2 did that without being all over the place.
[1:35:49] d1stract10n: demon alien dragon
[1:35:49] rich16bit: still had a war type battle like in most marvel
[1:35:51] DomLayne: It’s called Legend of the 10 Rings and then they just… don’t discuss them?
[1:35:51] reboot2099: TV series are even worse in this regard. Except for Loki, finales almost always suck
[1:35:59] ZemogJr: @blazerom for certain aspects, sure.  But who’s to say the Celestial actually physically appeared vs. a projection or something, or was only visible to some and not others, or.
[1:36:01] Barrh: i hated that he died LUL
[1:36:04] m3rcer: oh yeah got straight soul succ
[1:36:04] ilsombrero: Deathdealer
[1:36:06] OmarKhaledBadr: That dude got destroyed by a demon LUL
[1:36:19] m3rcer: arguably one of most skilled fighter
[1:36:21] DobbsjustDobbs: Y’all out here hatin on the dragon
[1:36:21] m3rcer: first to die
[1:36:28] twitchymctroll: got phasma'd
[1:36:36] SpaceDive: the dragon was my favorite part LUL
[1:36:36] OmarKhaledBadr: The guy with the sword arm too
[1:36:41] Falc1979: @LuckyNumber Yeah but they always have to one up stuff - so setting up a fragmented universe to fix is kinda the way they had to take it. I mean - they did it horribly but - /shrug LOL
[1:36:53] spideycsa: razor fist tenchiWoo
[1:37:01] Barrh: they kept razorfist instead of cool mask dude :/
[1:37:09] pc2400: same thing happened in Moon Knight
[1:37:18] m3rcer: i think its just that for Shang Chi we got to care about the son and dad dynamic and root for that conflict
[1:37:28] demigod791: @Stalker2400 Moon Knights actually worked for me XD
[1:37:28] m3rcer: then suddenly we get a cgi monster duel
[1:37:31] DyingEros: Same thing with Moon Knight and the gods fighting
[1:37:36] BlazeRom: @ZemogJr fair enough
[1:37:43] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[1:37:46] LuckyNumber: @Falc1979 yeah maybe they will come back with the big ideas and really "fix" everything. or it will be just a meh phase and they start fresh with 5
[1:37:49] m3rcer: when it coulda just been an epic showdown
[1:37:58] m3rcer: like an action movie
[1:37:59] WDForty: if all they said was that the clouds the place generates blocks radar, that would have been easier to take, vs "above radar"
[1:38:00] demigod791: look at Loki XD Lokis ending was good
[1:38:05] Ravnim: Loki had a great ending where they just talked
[1:38:06] Affly01: Doctor Strange 2 didn't have a epic finale
[1:38:15] profnesbitt: Dr strange and Loki had the best endings
[1:38:20] Falc1979: @itmeJP Also will that part of the head and hand be a permanent thing every time we see earth from now on - or will it be the biggest project the world has ever done in removing it?
[1:38:30] Zrmi: they need new good badguys
[1:38:31] OmarKhaledBadr: 'Strong enough to have it all. TOO WEAK TO TAKE IT' such a good scene
[1:38:56] Falc1979: @LuckyNumber I do not disagree - it was pretty damn bad! LOL
[1:39:47] profnesbitt: I hate Superman level heroes. I like them as villains.
[1:39:55] DobbsjustDobbs: Peggy saying The line was the worst part of strange 2 for me
[1:39:55] DyingEros: And she has 0 powers
[1:39:57] m3rcer: but was she above the radar when it happeneed
[1:39:58] DyingEros: Shes just a human
[1:40:06] DyingEros: @m3rcer You right.
[1:40:12] Lutcha81: yes but then we also saw her shoot lightning bolts out of her hands, so what is reality
[1:40:13] SpaceDive: physics DansGame
[1:40:13] Karhutt: Gravitationally she'd be dead, 100% agreed
[1:40:17] Holrend: she probably had the darkhold
[1:40:29] Jingleheimer1: she should've died 10 times in the first 20mins of that movie lol
[1:40:31] IceReaper898: @profnesbitt My least favorite part about Superman level heroes is that they never actually write them like they're superman level.
[1:40:34] Crafteroon: That's why Dr Strange 2 is better than Black Widow. Because when your back hits a fence when falling, you don't come back from that.
[1:40:38] LiamLee_iii: Wong would be dead when he fell at the end of Strange 2
[1:40:39] LeelandGrant: the big endfights often make the hero interchangable. At that moment, the character no longer matters cause the scope is too BIG
[1:40:40] OmarKhaledBadr: @Holrend LUL
[1:40:40] Zrmi: it's a comic reality.. if it looks cool its all good
[1:40:44] profnesbitt: Everybody in every movie who is knocked in unconscious for more than 30 seconds is going to have Brain damage.
[1:40:48] JusticetoAll: Is there some theories where she got some soviet super soldier variant or something
[1:40:49] tkcross21: @holrend LUL
[1:40:49] JusticetoAll: ?
[1:41:00] BlazeRom: Nanomachines son
[1:41:05] Iamdenril: we've seen her do the exact opposite in end-game
[1:41:08] m3rcer: @profnesbitt and even then superman in comics is that hes written alot to take account into that. hence "world made of cardboard". or how spiderman mentions he gets knocked back by normal dudes cause otherwise those guys would break their hands

[2:17:44] ZcottD: i dont think im smart enough for this game
[2:17:58] Shoaron: wait is there a chance that you lose your t5 blood to a t1 enemy after killing them or do you get to choose?
[2:18:01] zerohour_88: "ew, what is this pleb blood"
[2:18:31] Miros__: gotta hunt down that gamer girl blood for PVP? ijpHMM
[2:19:05] Bover99: @Shoaron if you get blood from a weaker enemy the strong buff is overwritten, but just killing doesn't
[2:19:26] El_Zilcho22: BattleRite doogThump doogThump doogThump
[2:19:29] Shoaron: ah kk
[2:19:33] Systemic66: a lot of people got salty when they made that battle royale
[2:19:39] Systemic66: instead of updating the arena mode
[2:19:49] Shoaron: BR was pretty good right? people jsut didn't play it iirc
[2:19:52] Systemic66: then both games died
[2:19:53] Poobzee: and then just abandoned
[2:19:58] El_Zilcho22: wish Battlerite was still popular.
[2:20:05] Nickonil: yeah they basically treat multiplayer games like a "release and done" thing
[2:20:12] Systemic66: stunlock seems to struggle to make money off their games
[2:20:24] NicVspz: Ah yes, early access with microtransactions
[2:20:48] San_Drone: battlerite arena was pretty good and fun
[2:21:14] Mopje_: are you done / finished with poe?
[2:21:16] eridani3: Pog the expanse
[2:21:28] zerohour_88: I'm kinda sold, but the performance issue is worrying
[2:21:29] DyingEros: @NicVspz Microtransactions is a bit of a buzzword. Its cosmetics.
[2:22:05] epicshoo: the salt was good while it lasted Sadge
[2:22:07] Zippee666: what was that game called again?
[2:22:10] OnePunchMac: Hey Guys
[2:22:13] OhDC: missed half that vid, was offline protection mentioned? its my one pet peeve with these survival games :s
[2:22:13] uzling: 214k RF dmg and 32k mine dmg.. got a t16 map... got to boss... 0 dmg to boss.. could not even remove its shield KEKW
[2:22:13] zerohour_88: V-Rising
[2:22:14] MikeTsa7: v rising
[2:22:15] Ajrags13: @Zippee666 V rising
[2:22:21] uzling: this patch is so fucking wired KEKW
[2:22:21] Zippee666: @Zippee666 Thankyou kindly
[2:22:22] iilu: OnePunchMac ijpHI
[2:22:24] synthetik666: yea my problem with PoE is that is still feels the exact same just about every league
[2:23:10] thanh_n2004: i luckily treat it as a comfort game so i don't mind it being the same
[2:23:22] BlueSapphyre: i gave up on poe in act 1. the beginning of that game got crazy hard.
[2:23:49] Nickonil: i played a year ago almost exactly, and i went from getting to maps is roughly 14-16 hours now.. i played 8 hours and i am on act 2..
[2:23:57] ApathyOwl: I just think GGG's direction with the game has been diverging with what I want from it for the last year or so Sadge
[2:23:57] ThePointGaming: I wonder if PoE would benefit from the adventure mode that D3 did?
[2:24:02] Reckless_Rob: Thats a good faultline
[2:24:10] ThePointGaming: Doing that campaign over and over just feels ughh
[2:24:22] thanh_n2004: agreed
[2:24:22] synthetik666: the real PoE :) Pillars of Eternity. such a good game
[2:24:33] Shoaron: didn't covid fck them?
[2:24:36] JimB0b0: Covid fucked the timeline I think
[2:25:05] Stormmaggeddon: I mean even without covid it seems like it was really far out
[2:25:12] Heracy: As a casual PoE player, yes
[2:25:22] TheTrixRabbitt: 100% - I have my steam deck and keep thinking about playing POE, but the thoughts of POE 2 has me waiting
[2:25:23] Shoaron: I am one of those people jsut waiting for PoE2 ijpSIP
[2:25:24] Stormmaggeddon: I fall into that category
[2:25:25] SirCris: I think their plans have always been to have it release around whenever Diablo 4 comes out either way
[2:25:29] Nickonil: yeah i sadly have to agree
[2:25:38] Darkblue08: Well good they didnt wait, it would have been cancelled because of Covid.
[2:25:53] iilu: I am a person waiting to watch other people play PoE2
[2:26:01] yrvengalied: Nope
[2:26:03] Stormmaggeddon: lol
[2:26:06] El_Zilcho22: hamster game?
[2:26:08] Shoaron: the current PoE has to many mechanics for me to follow along NotLikeThis
[2:26:08] itmeJP: https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20220513-12545/
[2:26:12] yrvengalied: which hamster
[2:26:16] Haeher: Definitely me I haven’t been playing cause I thought man POE2 is coming and now I’ve been out so long that I’m like I’m gonna wait for POE2
[2:26:19] Haeher: LULN
[2:26:22] Haeher: LUL
[2:26:52] yrvengalied: Ok lol adding it to the randos LUL
[2:27:09] yrvengalied: i will add it now
[2:27:10] SirCris: My thing is I just put so many hours into it that I'm ready for something new. Same with every other ARPG I played.
[2:27:46] MrDigitalCypher: I only have 246 hours in POE1 and I have never made it to maps.
[2:28:01] Nickonil: a "casual mode" would also be a big help for me even though i would feel awkward playing it that way
[2:28:09] ApathyOwl: CarlSmile
[2:28:11] ZeoBishop: we are truly feel the effect of covid
[2:28:14] SgtStruthers: KEKLEO
[2:28:14] Systemic66: I'm so sick of hearing about it
[2:28:15] synthetik666: im enjoying evil dead the game right now, its flawed. but still very fun. probably not for super long though admittedly
[2:28:28] Saryuken: Who cares about games now LUL
[2:28:30] Systemic66: dr strange 2 made me want to buy evil dead game
[2:28:52] RoniBranco: Top 3 isnt all CS GO at the moment?
[2:28:53] H4n1baL: isn't that rather reflecting the state of twitch right now? :P
[2:28:55] zerohour_88: the hypest video game thing coming is Summer Game Fest?
[2:29:03] Haeher: What games feels like I haven’t seen new games in ages or atleast ones that I’ve been interested in besides Indi games there are always great Indi gems
[2:29:07] Systemic66: that's a shame
[2:29:19] Craylith: I wonder if we will look back on 2022 in a few years and realize that it was quite harmful to the games industry
[2:29:43] SirCris: when I can't figure out what I want to play I browse and play from the Steam demos section
[2:29:55] Imbadyoureworse: evil dead game is real fun
[2:30:00] MrDigitalCypher: Elden ring set the bar too high and most other games are not offering the same good time high that ER did
