[0:33:06] Ernie0013: It literally wasn't allowed to come out in my country
[0:33:09] riduY: i think there's outrage cuz Diablo has historically been a more mainstream franchise, but now it's going mobile

[0:33:57] AinzN: Shoaron hypeE
[0:34:00] SquiZNovus: They didn't even bother to disable the lootboxes like in Overwatch, because you can't really do decent endgame without them
[0:34:01] SZebra: TBH I didn't feel like gameplay was better than D3, and the UI is even worse. But the MTX really turned me off (not a mobile gamer though).

[0:34:31] MasqureMan: They’re in the business of lawsuits atm
[0:34:31] Norrak1: The PC port is pretty bad though, but on mobile it's fantastic.
[0:34:38] CozyBeard: I just don't want to support that type of game. They will still make their money but it's the principle.
[0:34:39] Shoaron: @themdemo, ijpBOOP
[0:34:40] Tronmakers: also, suddenly you have a larger entity wanting your PR to be good when your baught
[0:34:40] Lord_Zapan: Imagine being Blizzard PR guy LUL
[0:34:44] Deusmorte: Diablo 4 is the only blizzard game i'm waiting for
[0:34:45] DoctorJohn: yeah honestly the PC port is the only part that's a little disappointing
[0:34:47] uzling: its not like using any money in immortal hinders you from having fun...

[0:35:19] yraelvaint: ijpWHALE
[0:35:19] DoctorJohn: every other blizz franchise combined, easy
[0:35:20] NPSJason: on the f2p-p2w scale Diablo definitely goes further than most big western releases, but it still probably caps out around a 6/10 on the scale
[0:35:20] saprobate: prolly
[0:35:21] woschdvendetta: are there any old school single player experiences on mobile? like pay/play once and be done kinda deal
[0:35:21] ItsJustReeses: Gonna make more then D3 and thats what makes me sad itsjus180SadBoi
[0:35:21] Xenflux: Normal people don't really care about the Internet's outrage of the week

[0:35:41] Slippage_: @ernie0013 oh no I know I was just making a stupid joke. I saw there for a few eu countries that banned it. Loot box rules are trying to spread in eu it seems
[0:35:47] osakey: Now I want a Marvel game like Pokemon Snap LUL
[0:35:50] Sven_Stryker: Snap still isn't officially out though, right?

[0:35:57] hulskiey: you can look up sensor tower stats for mobile rvenue at the end of month
[0:35:58] TheToDDYz: I'm waiting to get access to the beta for Marvel snap lol
[0:36:01] OhTenGeneral: Their monetization seems to be working very well. The daily reset on when you can buy is deviously addictive
[0:36:02] TheChristopherG: Still waiting for an invite PepeHands
[0:36:03] freaker286: I am still waiting for my beta invite
[0:36:06] Qbush: i was genuinely surprised at how many streamers i watched yesterday that had generally no idea how mobile game monetization works
[0:36:07] yrvengalied: i think it is getting some fund
[0:36:10] Zeinternetz: Surprised Marvel Snap didn't get more streamers into closed beta
[0:36:11] HighLord_PanCake: i wouldnt want this as like my "main game" but its fine/ pretty cool for like some fun newish diablo game. im just chillin playing for free
[0:36:14] SabertoothEwok: It’s not open download yet
[0:36:14] yrvengalied: not big yet though
[0:36:30] Shoaron: @yrvengalied, ijpLOVE
[0:36:31] OhTenGeneral: I would imagine on full release they are going to make a fuckton of money
[0:36:36] kapjak: how are liking runeterra? @itmejp that has some pretty good monetization.
[0:36:41] Meis122: I feel the same. Whenever I go to buy a variant I stop because I want to save gold for crafting materials
[0:36:45] Onefootstout: since its beta its prob not on the charts
[0:36:45] kapjak: how are you*
[0:36:46] yrvengalied: @Shoaron ijpH ijpLOVE
[0:36:47] Voidheim: @HighLord_PanCake same. I'm literally just playing for the lore. Once I get all the lore, I'll be done. It's nice seeing old characters.
[0:36:52] yrvengalied: Snap is still in beta
[0:36:55] yrvengalied: right
[0:36:59] YellowKiwi: @kapjak Runeterra is the best card game monetization I think.
[0:37:10] 7trektoe: we get to take pics of blackwidows ass nice
[0:37:20] ThemDemo: Might be a rounding things
[0:37:20] BlazeRom: still earning millions at least

[0:37:28] Hallem: Hey @itmejp  and chat ijpLOVE ijpHI
[0:37:31] hulskiey: probably
[0:37:33] Kurozakai: not suprising tbh
[0:37:35] TheChristopherG: Not enough Morbius to make them money
[0:37:39] Voidheim: ^
[0:37:40] NoorElBahrain: Hallem ijpHI
[0:37:40] Sven_Stryker: different icons in upper corner, yeah
[0:37:45] BlazeRom: They need to Morb out
[0:37:45] SMonTwitch: Yes, the icon shows which platform
[0:37:49] Elievex: Yes the icon is on the right
[0:37:53] lotote45: JP do you know the game has facial recognition in the game for Chinese market!!
[0:38:12] SMonTwitch: I doubt the data has been collated yet

[0:38:40] WDForty: did you know that ios and android have permissions controls
[0:38:42] cTrix: Outrage? I want in
[0:38:42] Syllvn: @lotote45 It's a requirement in China...
[0:38:46] xarantur: the face ID stuff is for their "you can't play games at night" thing for children
[0:38:47] Boshean: ijpANGY
[0:38:50] Mana_Sora: i think he was saying, you need facial recognition to play the game
[0:38:51] Mrshilka: likely for chinese gov mandates
[0:38:52] thesestrangenotions: @itmeJP games in china have introduced facial tracking for the curfew
[0:38:57] TacoTangler: next thing china will do is make me remember my password
[0:39:00] lotote45: For the game itself
[0:39:01] NoorElBahrain: I can't believe morbius got memed into semi-success and is not back in theaters.
[0:39:01] SMonTwitch: It's a gov mandate to track game time
[0:39:02] WDForty: oh that shit
[0:39:03] bakavic: those software are a standard part of development suite in mobile apps
[0:39:07] Julia: i find diablo immortal really fun, but i need a shower after each session, it is what it is tho danJulia also hi
[0:39:08] titanodin: my car has pocket recognition to detect my keys

[0:40:24] ItsNoxid: looks like d3 but better
[0:40:25] gigamesh00: pc client with mobile ui
[0:40:27] Voidheim: the PC client looks bad, but they still call it a beta for the PC
[0:40:27] thanh_n2004: dude, imagine if i could put my face on my barbarian
[0:40:28] Syllvn: The game looks great

[0:40:40] woschdvendetta: i mean it's diablo LUL
[0:40:42] vallitz: The pc client is beta, it's not good to be honest

[0:40:55] Mrshilka: @Julia always happy to see you over here Julia ijpH
[0:40:58] Julia: it looks super well on an ipad pro 2020, its 60fps and ultra
[0:40:59] Norrak1: But on mobile at 60fps maxed out it looks great
[0:41:00] Voidheim: they call the PC client a beta right now. So they have plans to tweak it.
[0:41:05] uzling: crashing alot for me :(
[0:41:06] Yngvar: There's a lot of good art in the game. That's the best thing I can say about it.
[0:41:10] Joitch: I kinda want to try it but its not gonna be released here Sadge

[0:41:32] TheToDDYz: Theres a character called JP on the new Street Fighter lmao
[0:41:34] German_LoCaD: PC Immortal feels like a downgraded D3 so why not just play 3
[0:41:36] RybackStun: viewership for DI is pretty bad unless you are already a top 10 twitch streamer
[0:41:39] WDForty: still waiting for that snap invite Sadge
[0:41:40] SirCris: it's mostly just people saying it's p2w

[0:43:19] Akabuu: has jp done the pog face at the games yet? did i miss it? D:
[0:43:20] hulskiey: zoomers cant read that well so streamers use symbols
[0:43:20] Br0jon: @itmeJP I think you'd hate it honestly. I do love it personally though. Maybe in another 5 years haha
[0:43:24] Mrshilka: monkey see monkey do

[0:44:11] murasaur: yeah, p much
[0:44:11] h3ybrian: The real question @itmejp is why don’t you have sirens on your title
[0:44:13] Riph_Raph: @xarantur KEKW

[0:44:20] Axeum: jorerSip jorerNizuko jorerHug
