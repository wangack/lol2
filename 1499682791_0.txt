[0:49:58] finale_lol: I really want RNG to win a Worlds championship, since they're the only team with a policy to not get Korean players to get become better. IG - FPX - EDG all had 2 Korean players in their roster when they won Worlds, so it kinda leaves a salty taste that they are not the strongest region with the players they produce domestically.
