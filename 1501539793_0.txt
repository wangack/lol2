[0:17:09] fred_birkhoff: 3-2
[0:17:11] stalla1234: @kukka30 wow
[0:17:19] captainkrajick: it's not that hard to get 89k really. I was 100k but I lost it all betting on V5 PepeHands
[0:17:21] thatsdanny4u: @tommychan123456 3-2 its was close
[0:17:24] stalla1234: How to collect a lot of channel points
[0:17:27] kukka30: @wck12345 how much do you have?
[0:17:41] captainkrajick: @tommychan123456 didn't they lose to EG
[0:17:44] kukka30: @captainkrajick deserved for betting on V5 KEKW
[0:17:48] captainkrajick: @wck12345 bet and win
[0:18:02] captainkrajick: @kukka30 i won most of it betting on V5 though
[0:18:09] kukka30: @captainkrajick i lost alot betting on FPX in last split finals KEKW
[0:18:14] fred_birkhoff: i think the whole format of MSI and Worlds is bad. they should have best of 3's earlier than rumble stage
[0:18:15] captainkrajick: i live and die by V5

[0:19:34] kukka30: @captainkrajick damn Pog
[0:19:39] thatsdanny4u: @fred_birkhoff @fred_birkhoff i agree, give lower regions a chance to compete at rumble stage like OCE
[0:19:40] kukka30: Lets go LNG
[0:20:02] kukka30: If i see Lvmao on rift today i'll go berserker
[0:20:31] captainkrajick: @kukka30 they announced starting roster already for game 1 so it's not Lvmao at least for game 1
[0:21:00] kukka30: "atleast for game 1" point to be noted
[0:21:09] captainkrajick: @fred_birkhoff I think that the worse regions should have to face each other to compete vs the better teams. Because what's the point of being shitstomped by RNG like 12 times in a row
[0:21:17] kukka30: amount of favour given to lvmao last split was abnoxious
[0:21:53] captainkrajick: @kukka30 tbf Lvmao solo won LPL for JDG so you gotta give him that at least. Shame he fell off though
[0:22:12] Jethro_F22: @kukka30 That game 5 bard was epic
[0:22:25] kukka30: @captainkrajick JDG Lvmao was monster
