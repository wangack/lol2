[4:51:45] michelangelee: @c0rrup710n It's just a bad pick considering RA's team comp. They want early game win because of Lucian Nami and Reskai, Ornn gives good late game security but Viktor is meh because he gets outscaled by Azir and won't do enough burst to kill anyone late game especially with Kayle on the other side. Basically, not good enough early and not good late
