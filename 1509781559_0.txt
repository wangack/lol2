[3:10:38] maolanu: even waves always push from closer to the tower
[3:10:45] Derfrk: @ShinsuZYX She pushed only because she knew it would push away from her - to have a top lane freeze against yourself in Top on your side of the lane, you need at least 3-4 extra minions on enemy side. That time it was only 2, not enough
[3:10:45] saken123: @saimorales12z yes very possible
