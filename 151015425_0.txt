[2:35:52] Envoy_of_the_End: @ScarraFace but yea, if u're like 6 place in LCK going into playoff, good luck winning that shit lol, you gotta play 1 bo3 and 4 bo5
[2:36:07] Meshugunah: LUL T LUL S LUL M LUL
[2:36:09] sad0ptimist: @ScarraFace Yeah because of the gauntlet, but i think worlds is much more competitive rather then just the top 2 smashing everyone
[2:36:16] MarkusAnime: Should TSM get a new jungled?
[2:36:16] goblinguy01: If you are 6th place in Korea. You need to win 3-4 Bo5

[2:37:17] goblinguy01: That's hard to win that many consecutive series in a row
[2:37:20] MarkusAnime: Let's play a game: if SKT never existed, who would win worlds in their 3 years they won it?
[2:37:35] Envoy_of_the_End: KT bullet won first year
[2:37:37] goblinguy01: S3 would have been Royal Club vs Najin 100%
[2:37:42] Envoy_of_the_End: no
[2:37:49] michaelsund: I didn't watch s3 but the others are KOO and Rox
[2:37:50] The_True_Lion: Team Velocity 3 times world champs without SKT
[2:37:50] MarkusAnime: No Gambit/M5?
[2:37:56] Envoy_of_the_End: KT bullets would have stomped Najin
[2:38:03] Envoy_of_the_End: they were only 2nd to SKT
[2:38:06] goblinguy01: S2 - TPA best team
[2:38:12] goblinguy01: S3 would have been Uzi vs KT

[2:38:33] Envoy_of_the_End: season 3 would definitely be KT Bullets, and season 4 probably Samsung
[2:38:40] goblinguy01: S4 would have been SSW vs OMG/ROYAL Club
[2:38:43] Envoy_of_the_End: @MarkusDCSD didn't u see MVP Ozone at world? lol

[2:39:41] Envoy_of_the_End: season 5, would probably be Koo Tiger
[2:39:50] Envoy_of_the_End: and 6 i would say Rox
[2:39:54] fnask10: Can they stop thinking snake have good players? Flandre sucks, zztai sucks mid, its like saying fcking Wickd is still a good toplaner
[2:39:56] Envoy_of_the_End: Samsung looks good but
[2:40:01] Envoy_of_the_End: they didn't go against SKT
[2:40:11] sad0ptimist: Faker is going to be smashing everyone in his 30s 4Head
