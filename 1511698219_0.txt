[1:10:22] captainkrajick: AL is really strong rn. It's so good to see Forge poppin off
[1:10:30] hermeneutist: if anything, betty's lower gold% while still contributing is probably better

[1:12:13] monobeno: Why LGD benched Haichao for 2 weeks I will never know
[1:12:35] monobeno: I'd fire the LGD coach for starting Ye fucking G over Haichao
[1:13:15] monobeno: The fact they're starting Haichao today means AL will get obliterated 2-0
[1:14:00] SuperM0nkey123: ZERI
[1:14:25] monobeno: Give Haichao the counterpick
[1:14:37] JVhunts: @ethansix what if... hear me out, this might be a crazy idea... what if you tune in 20 min later when they are not talking anymore?
