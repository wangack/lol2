[1:05:46] sxnnervso: @m012345678 thanks for always answering my questions
[1:05:47] monobeno: @Vayonnaise Who do they even win against? They're the worst team by a huge margin
[1:05:51] FlyingStiffArm: @avoidvso 4 o‚Äôclock
[1:06:07] nesbylol: TT can win COPIUM
[1:06:13] thatsdanny4u: @douchbug definitely not RNG lol
[1:06:14] monobeno: @Vayonnaise They have a paycheck stealing botlane that isn't even LDL level
[1:06:17] Vayonnaise: @monobeno worse than FPX? TT?
[1:06:21] lVGa0: @douchbug FPX BLG AL IG
[1:06:21] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[1:06:34] monobeno: Yes, they are worse than FPX
[1:06:35] stephcurrysim: RNG V5 EDG TES are locked for worlds don't even bother debating it, JDG is going to feel the burn of fielding yagao mid when push comes to shove, he's been super lackluster this split in their losses
[1:06:50] Vayonnaise: @monobeno ahh that's fair. botlane is def where they're suffering
[1:06:53] painmbv: 20 wr player KEKW
[1:06:57] monobeno: And TT isn't even that bad with Beichuan and Xiaoxiang
[1:07:10] goodboy_yanfei: 20 wr player KEKW
[1:07:16] mazeevelous: nice winrate KEKW
[1:07:19] lVGa0: @stephcurrysim this guy is bandwagon dont be fooled for what he type
[1:07:31] monobeno: @Vayonnaise WE deserves everything by signing someone as shit as Smlz, who is literally stealing paychecks
[1:07:41] LinHyouka: better than chat still at 20 wr KEKW
[1:07:42] stephcurrysim: bandwagon for who? i don't support any of those 4 teams LOL outside of rookie and v5 maybe
[1:07:51] thatsdanny4u: i just want to see TES vs any LCK team, not RNG
[1:08:07] stephcurrysim: TES would wipe any lck team
[1:08:13] riskqey: why does it matter what nba team he supports? KEKW
[1:08:25] astralinfluence35: v5 vs t1 finals
[1:08:40] stephcurrysim: t1 aren't making finals
[1:08:45] Vayonnaise: @monobeno also fair. I didn't think they were gonna be a top team or anything just didn't think they'd be 0-X haha
[1:08:50] lVGa0: @stephcurrysim ur ign maybe you change it if boston win your name rn must be jasontatum
[1:09:03] stephcurrysim: LOL ?
[1:09:09] Rensebrink: i just wanna see ppgod vs lck Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:09:16] stephcurrysim: yeah okay mate i haven't been supporting the warriors since 2012 you're right
[1:09:22] mrcygnusvibing: when is it going to start
[1:09:24] FlyingStiffArm: I hope both teams give a good show, plenty of kills
[1:09:31] monobeno: @Vayonnaise Which is also why I have them way worse than FPX, FPX's adc is at least a former world champ, he became worse but not paycheck stealing worse
[1:09:33] astralinfluence35: yeah I wanna see ppgod plating internationally lol
[1:09:54] oce_mir4i: did lgd won?
[1:10:03] tvhessi: @stephcurrysim stop lying bandwagoner
[1:10:23] stephcurrysim: it must hurt you that steph has 4 rings
[1:10:28] FlyingStiffArm: @nguyenhung0410 Yeah
[1:10:44] shibuyasjp: who is who
[1:10:48] Vayonnaise: @monobeno FPX just seems like they aren't all on the same page. like watching a solo queue game alot of the time. although same could def be said about WE
[1:10:52] Rensebrink: @astralinfluence35 yup, that will be meme out of control TPFufun
[1:10:57] monobeno: didn't curry get carried hard by durant?
[1:11:09] oce_mir4i: man omg sucks
[1:11:14] stephcurrysim: FPX doesn't have a coordination problem they have a clid problem
[1:11:19] tvhessi: @stephcurrysim im a kings fan bro. I really dont care who wins rings lmao
[1:11:20] stephcurrysim: change their jungler and they'll be a playoff team immediately
[1:11:38] heyy_allex: baiCLOWN
[1:11:50] stephcurrysim: you probably do care considering you're ready to call anyone a bandwagoner if the team they support wins
[1:11:51] Vayonnaise: @stephcurrysim if said jungler could reel them in I could see it
[1:11:59] stephcurrysim: if rings didn't matter bandwagoners wouldn't bother you
[1:12:03] ClarkAndrewww: !score
[1:12:05] FlyingStiffArm: @tvhessi You are loyal asf being a kings fan
[1:12:08] lVGa0: BLG should get H4cker to make in playoffs
[1:12:23] stephcurrysim: Clid is quite literally the worst jungler in the LPL rn, he's too big an anchor for FPX to carry
[1:12:28] Rensebrink: idk what's wrong with supporting gsw, they win like 1 title in 5 years?
[1:12:31] M012345678: Games haven't started yet

[1:57:10] itzaugment: "touch grass" is not an insult towards gamers, rather it is advice for them. When participating in intense periods of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty. The sweat causes the hand to become slick, and it b becomes more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse, thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense gaming moments.
