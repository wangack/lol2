[0:46:24] aiandcola: and EG beat T1
[0:46:35] shippexlol: @monobeno Damwon isnt even 2nd best in the LCK
[0:46:49] monobeno: The last LCK team to win before DK is Samsung
[0:46:57] shippexlol: @ouyanwanlu Ur on some copium, it was a close 3-2 banger. Where t1 wouldve won if they didnt completely int draft.

[0:49:05] aiandcola: but i dont think RNG is better than EG
[0:49:11] aiandcola: that s it
[0:49:22] Criminal997: loool
[0:49:50] RG_jvx: it's exhausting to see the  same thing at every event, LCK  is better while they always lose to LPL. Get over it, LPL is just better rn

[0:50:04] ehxales: @TehClownz based and true
[0:50:09] MogdarPhoenix: @ouyanwanlu Ooooo... k.... We will see in world championship
[0:50:14] shippexlol: @inaf9 Did you even see game 3 draft? Like I said, RNG won cuz t1 trolled draft for no apperant reason. That being said LPL is obviously by far the superior region.
[0:50:21] shippexlol: @inaf9 Game 5*
[0:50:30] aiandcola: EU IS THE MOST FUKING TERRIBLE REGION IN THE WORLD

[0:50:52] monobeno: Ah yes, always the draft excuse COPIUM
[0:50:57] monobeno: LCK fans are so funny
[0:50:58] aiandcola: NA always ＞EU NA just unlcky
[0:51:16] MogdarPhoenix: @shippexlol I think LPL and LCK are very equal, but yes, I didn't understand T1's last draft lol
[0:51:22] shippexlol: @RG_jvx Nobody is saying LPL isnt the best region. Im saying that Msi was close. And that t1 couldve won if they didnt troll draft. That being said I hate LCK. Doesnt mean I need to be biased and say that they played very bad.
[0:51:34] glaysyou: why xlb again
[0:51:45] monobeno: "Draft excuse"
[0:51:56] shippexlol: @MogdarPhoenix Yeah exactly, to pretend that the difference between rng and t1 is insanely big is just weird.
[0:51:57] Darkapplez: @RG_jvx Way too rational for LPL twitch chat
[0:52:30] M012345678: catJAM
[0:52:34] shippexlol: @monobeno Again, I hate LCK. Its not an excuse, their drafts wasnt optimal.  Even the biggest lpl fans can admit that. Surely.
[0:53:04] monobeno: Draft is a part of the game, cant use it as an excuse
[0:53:07] aiandcola: RNG is better than T1 but EG is better than T1 as well ,EG BEAT T1 ASS
[0:53:11] RG_jvx: it's not about LPL twitch chat, it's about everywhere online. Reddit, MSI twitch chat, worlds twitch chat, world casters ... and so on
[0:53:34] MogdarPhoenix: Faker picked Ahri, a champion that was absolutely useless the whole series, Zeus picked Jayce (really?) and botlane was Jhin and Yuumi. Well, someone tell me why in spring split that was a good draft xD
[0:53:44] monobeno: Imagine saying a team would of won if they didn't play like shit, same thing as draft
[0:53:51] MogdarPhoenix: *spring split 2022
[0:54:03] Darkapplez: @RG_jvx This chat is smaller and filled with bandwagoners that support LPL because they're the best region... the perfect cocktail for loads of shit takes and toxicity
[0:54:04] litwos28: Rich KappaPride
[0:54:06] shippexlol: @monobeno Im not using it as an excuse, im not rooting for lck. But when draft is the main difference between to teams, you cant say it wasnt close. Specially when its 3-2 series.
[0:54:10] monobeno: playing well is part of the game, drafting well is also part of the game, you do bad in 1 you lose

[0:56:02] cry888887: After 5-0 and 0-4
[0:56:08] shippexlol: @monobeno If you dont think T1 couldve won game 5 with a proper draft then I dont know what to tell you. Im not even saying they would win. All I was really trying to say is that T1 is a very strong team. Even by LPL standards. Damwon is not.

[0:59:23] wyhtobu: LPL has few international fans
[0:59:27] monobeno: Jamada? Who
[0:59:27] shippexlol: @inaf9 RNG played incredibly well. And they deserved to win. But to pretend t1 was far off is just not true. They really improved true out the tournament.
