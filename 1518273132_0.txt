[3:26:56] sweetkazen: @TheOreoCupcake  Also the shy I think, they both registered in LPL first
[3:26:59] TheOreoCupcake: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• Fun fact, he's Korean and came to China as an import.
[3:27:06] drphisycopata: Nice pick ig ‚Äúseraphine adc‚Äù looks like my ranked

[3:27:18] lVGa0: BLG should start hiring Smlz
[3:27:18] cameliaflow: Both teams KEKW

[3:27:49] laberta8: MEGALUL DG DIF
[3:27:50] gorky88: i told you 25 min win ez
[3:27:52] TheOreoCupcake: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• @kappa_scute has permanent resident rn I think. Along with Scout.
[3:27:54] hermeneutist: i detect some gaslighters trying to salvage doggo's reputation from one game where he snowballs vs noob laners trying new champs
[3:28:01] sweetkazen: Thats not really how import works tho @TheOreoCupcake  he doesnt even count import for the import policies which makes every team can only have two imports for any game
[3:28:08] bluesclues96: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• rookie and doinb are basically chinese at this point
[3:28:17] perfectrotation7: this seraphine senna, tahm senna bot lane is so fk cringe man

[3:28:53] TheOreoCupcake: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• "Foreign" player impact the salary more than we think. Uzi was definitely not earning 1.2 mil a year in 2015 KEKW

[3:29:39] sweetkazen: @TheOreoCupcake  oh yeah, to "dig" a player out of LCK costs a lot, Nuguri definitely earned a lot more than Doinb
[3:29:40] l3vi1: @MDMJ_ But my team IG can still win BibleThump
[3:29:40] darpaksss: @miradordesucasa yes but not in lpl xd

[3:30:30] jetlagging1: WeiWeiWei
[3:30:31] ÊúàÊ¢ì: BloodTrail
[3:30:33] hermeneutist: let's just say that doinb can retire any time and actually earn more money streaming

[3:31:09] l3vi1: @MDMJ_ IG will be back in form in be top 3 in lpl :(
[3:31:09] sweetkazen: Doinb makes a shit ton from streams, one the most successful streamer in China right now
[3:31:11] TheOreoCupcake: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• That's more like it. That sounds "reasonable" for a new LCK import.
[3:31:13] ÈÄÜËΩâ‰Ω†ÁöÑÈÄÜËΩâ: BLG with BIN and CRISP on the team and keep losing LUL
[3:31:15] hermeneutist: pro play is an actual waste of time for doinb, cos he could easily stream 3h more a day instead
[3:31:15] tantrokyniem: @Âì≠Âì≠Â¶πÁ¥ô Doggo small and stupid just like Taiwan
[3:31:16] ÈçäÈäÖË°ìÂ£´_‰∏çÁ¥ÑÂÖíÁ´•: FOFO carry on bench KEKW

[3:31:35] ÈóúÊåñÂ±ÅËòáÂñî: Doggo needs BLG Liang BibleThump
[3:31:42] KC_Rikuo: tai what?
[3:31:45] ËÄÅ‰ªô: @Âì≠Âì≠Â¶πÁ¥ô nmsl
[3:31:48] hermeneutist: doinb could also easily get any type of guest hosting job with lpl and possibly even in lck
[3:31:50] Âì≠Âì≠Â¶πÁ¥ô: Liang BibleThump
[3:31:54] lVGa0: Doggo need BLG PK
[3:31:54] Âè™ÊòØË∑ØÈÅéÁöÑÁãóÁãó: CRISP MVP
[3:31:55] MDMJ_: @l3vi1 I won't hold my breath on it
[3:31:56] sweetkazen: @ultranovel  he is no doubt a skilled player, cant say the same about his professionalism tho
[3:32:22] bluesclues96: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• agreed
[3:32:29] l3vi1: @MDMJ_ I would...and die as a result
[3:32:29] sweetkazen: @TheOreoCupcake  if we are only talking about LPL streamers, he should be number 1 I think

[3:32:52] ye1l: Doggo got carried in game 1 and 3 and solo lost game 2...
[3:33:23] sweetkazen: @ye1l  IKR, might as well just let UZI play LUL its better for business KEKW
[3:33:31] ÎßûÏß±ÍπîÏÉàÍ∫Ñ: icon pog
[3:33:33] hermeneutist: IG just trying out new champs in live game with a sub adc

[3:34:04] lVGa0: LNG made a bad decision
[3:34:08] Âì≠Âì≠Â¶πÁ¥ô: Doggo is the best relax15
[3:34:20] tadeu131991: jeje
[3:34:21] ye1l: at least Uzi has fans yeah, but when blg benched him he just quit and got married KEKW good for him
[3:34:32] KC_Rikuo: wink 100 kp pog KappaHD
[3:34:33] Âè™ÊòØË∑ØÈÅéÁöÑÁãóÁãó: 1-0-19
[3:34:44] lVGa0: @ye1l he needs money for marriage
[3:34:54] ye1l: the worst of it is that Crisp only joined BLG because he was promised to play with Uzi but BLG never even let Uzi scrim properly, at most he did 2 scrim blocks a week which is pretty much nothing
[3:35:06] l3vi1: @KC_Rikuo he's just that goof Kappa
[3:35:12] sweetkazen: UZI's health definitely killed his careers, Its better to just go back to normal life now
[3:35:22] ye1l: otherwise crisp could've been on a team that would actually be able to win things
[3:35:36] lVGa0: I think BLG 4th seed in Worlds
[3:35:56] sweetkazen: Diabetes and both hand and back injuries
[3:36:02] l3vi1: @ye1l why though? all the hype and advertising that UZI will be back only to bench him
[3:36:03] ye1l: if BLG gets 4th seed then LPL will have teams lose to LEC and LCS in groups lol
[3:36:11] sweetkazen: @‰πÇÊñ¨‰ΩõÁÜäÊ±∂Èä®‰πÇ  slightly, yes.
[3:36:28] lVGa0: Peeyan had Kidney Failure but he is okay now
[3:36:31] ye1l: @l3vi1 Because blg scammed him, they wanted him as a streamer for their platform, nothing else
[3:36:55] sweetkazen: Oh yeah, thats true tho
[3:36:59] Thesimpop: Lpl 5 seeds, lck 4 seeds, lec 3 and lcs 2 would be the best for worlds
[3:37:07] sweetkazen: UZI is streaming for the sponsor of BLG now
[3:37:09] Âì≠Âì≠Â¶πÁ¥ô: Crisp did great job
[3:37:18] sweetkazen: Bilibili
[3:37:18] l3vi1: @ye1l Unlucky him. From RNG's prison contract to scammers
[3:37:41] l3vi1: @Thesimpop say that again
[3:37:41] Mothersmandolin: What the hell is up
[3:38:15] Prezzylol: who won ?
[3:38:17] ye1l: a team like DRX eats BLG for breakfast though, no shot BLG makes worlds
[3:38:25] lVGa0: FoFo is most fraud player he gave up his position for Icon and accept luxury item from Icon
[3:38:28] sweetkazen: even QG got disbanded where UZi stayed for a year or some KEKW what an unlucky dude
[3:38:31] Mothersmandolin: DAGDA is the greatest tho
[3:38:37] M012345678: @SkyWheel Should be only a few minutes
[3:38:37] sweetkazen: And in OMG nobody liked UZI
[3:38:40] LmaoLp: @l3vi1 BLG didn't exactly have the best reputation before uzi. they do have money to throw at problems instead though, but it doesn't fix everything
[3:38:48] OddmfkFuture: uzi is bad and was never good
[3:39:09] jeffwonderch: wow
[3:39:12] lVGa0: Uzi doesnt like America so he didnt go to NA
[3:39:18] sweetkazen: Id say UZI only got 4 years of proper play and all of them were with RNG, S3 S4 S7 S8

[3:40:03] zeddywapp: commentators op
[3:40:04] sweetkazen: And TBF, he did blow it for the team in S7 for not knowing how to play Xayah at the time KEKW
[3:40:15] l3vi1: @LmaoLp true UZI made BLG famous but they did him so bad
[3:40:20] sweetkazen: so nobody to blame for not having any S champ
[3:40:35] bbdos: Vibe

[3:41:33] sweetkazen: but UZI not knowing how to play xayah definitely played its part
[3:41:58] sweetkazen: Rakan and xayah the fire duo for that meta
[3:42:00] ÂñúÂíßËÄÉÂñî: pepeJAM
[3:42:07] lVGa0: Breathe doesnt like FoFo he agreed with RNG Offers
[3:42:12] vicviper: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• implying they can let more powerful picks through, why didn't T1 ban Gwen? same reason LUL
[3:42:19] LeBesta_: somg name?
[3:42:35] lVGa0: FoFo is harsh talker sometimes
[3:42:43] ÂñúÂíßËÄÉÂñî: @lvga0 big L for RNG tho
[3:42:44] jetlagging1: will be a quick 2-0 for RNG
[3:43:33] lVGa0: Dont forget COLD that guy is legend YYDS
[3:43:42] MountEnvy: DansGame bring the music back
[3:43:52] sweetkazen: @vicviper  I mean, I would say that at the time Galio was the most powerful pick out of all picks. It allowed faker to help the bot lane too much thus not allowing UZI to do what he does best, winning lanes
[3:43:53] ÂñúÂíßËÄÉÂñî: FeelsAmazingMan Kappu
[3:44:12] taisaan: 35ping match?
[3:44:23] HuhhGuy: rng game bout to start?
[3:44:23] sweetkazen: UZI was definitely still the most powerful ad player in laning phase in S7
[3:44:52] max5464shy: SeemsGood
[3:44:55] vicviper: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• so you would let xayah through and Uzi getting gapped instead? LUL
[3:45:01] HuhhGuy: omg +1.5 is the play guys :)
[3:45:02] lVGa0: @ye1l its okay dude you will be back someday
[3:45:13] HuhhGuy: all of rng series have gone 3 games this split
[3:45:46] sweetkazen: @vicviper  UZI couldnt play it tho, there were even games when Xayah rakan was open and he cant pick her. putting RNG in a bad position in BP
[3:45:51] lVGa0: OMG Able is one of the 3 Genius AD in LPL with JKL and IBoy
[3:45:52] Moobot: THE LPL NOW HAS AN OFFICIAL DISCORD SERVER! Join here: https://discord.com/invite/tZBguQtcAc
[3:46:01] sweetkazen: so they are already at a disadvantage
[3:46:29] vicviper: @ÊàëÊòØÂ§ßÈ†≠È≥• exactly, that was why RNG needed to ban her, because they can't afford her on the other side
[3:46:36] sweetkazen: I would just let UZI do his thing and win a unfavored matchup than letting faker constanly helping with bot skirmishes
[3:46:44] vicviper: and there were other must ban champions during that time
[3:46:48] sweetkazen: But thats just me tho
[3:46:57] lVGa0: GenG will be Undefeated. JDG will be Undefeated.
[3:47:21] sweetkazen: I mean, they could've tried for one game tho out of the 5
[3:47:40] sweetkazen: Galio was having so much impact on the entire map
