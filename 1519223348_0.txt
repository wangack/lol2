[1:56:06] bolyvfr: they fired their main coach
[1:56:07] Jethro_F22: @monobeno Because he was absolute god-tier last year and it's sad to see him not performing to the same level
[1:56:10] mhcd: @mohammad_somady0019 they still hiding their secret method to win

[1:57:23] monobeno: @Jethro_F22 So because he was god tier last year, you're sad he won't be at worlds this year due to him being shit tier?
[1:57:35] longkazama: @mohammad_somady0019 so strong? are u sure? got beaten by 100T and T1? went to 5 games to both RNG and DK
[1:57:42] longkazama: they won by a hair

[1:58:02] IllegalSpaceman: TheShy GIGACHAD
[1:58:03] Jethro_F22: @ashemain6996 Maybe they do another documentary series this year so we can see what's happening behind the scenes. Must be something going on to cause such talented players to underperform.
[1:58:05] deecaffeinatedTV: TT lost?
[1:58:13] deecaffeinatedTV: *lose
[1:58:14] nengw: FIORA SOO SEZY
[1:58:24] kaiserwroth: skill is relative, when the teams play their best right from the beginning of the season and the meta changes they almost always fail to make it to playoffs

[1:58:54] top1cringe_po_vys: theshy Kayle KEKW
[1:58:59] longkazama: LPL is literally the most competitive region in the worlds where countless world class players fail to make worlds every year
[1:58:59] ashemain6996: @ashemain6996 my only theory is that the addition of doinb didnt go as planned
[1:59:12] Jethro_F22: @monobeno There's a difference between being a bad player and having a bad performance. In his case it's the latter. So yes, I am sad to not see such a great player perform on the world stage. Obviously it's because his performance this year isn't good enough to earn the spot, but it's sad nonetheless
[1:59:21] nengw: Flandre best top :/
[1:59:41] longkazama: why do u think every different LPL team dominate the LPL every year/split

[2:00:50] Jethro_F22: @ashemain6996 Either that, or they just massively overperformed last year and with the change in roster they're performing at a level much more reflective of how good they really are
[2:00:51] jackkiekkk: hola
[2:00:51] Er0yzer: lebronJAM anything she wants
[2:00:56] monobeno: @Jethro_F22 He is being flamed to shreds right now for having a champion puddle, Corki one trick, can't play meta mid laners like Ahri and Lissandra

[2:02:52] M012345678: catJAM 🎺
[2:03:06] monobeno: @Jethro_F22 Whats the point in being able to play shit like Kled when you can't play top tier picks like Zoe
[2:03:07] Jethro_F22: @monobeno Okay
[2:03:09] ashemain6996: @ashemain6996 I dont wanna believe that I really liked the way they played during summer playoffs
