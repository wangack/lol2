[0:47:15] Vanfenyy: A
[0:47:18] darkblade83: Sofm mentality is to carry , when his teammates get behind he tends to outreach and makes mistake , thats my concern xD
[0:47:35] krazy2xtreme: LPL = dead region
[0:47:40] prof3ssorlive: Also @riotpulse I miss your casting. I had a baby otherwise in wouldn't even be up right now but looking forward to catching up on VODs of matches you cast last week!

[0:52:49] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Hi ma man
[0:54:07] 69TV: I think dans comp is fine but i dont understand the jhin
[0:54:14] PulseIRL: @lledaff Kappa /
[0:54:32] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Miss your casting KappaPride
[0:54:49] UsakPrensesiZarakiDayi_: @RiotPulse what do you think about this match ?
[0:54:50] PulseIRL: <3 KappaPride
[0:55:11] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Will you be at worlds again ?
[0:55:17] goblinguy01: @zoomenhanced It seems like Sofm and Ohq don't have good Mandarin. If they need signs in 4 languages and talk in English during meetings...
[0:55:32] PulseIRL: @Erdalbibi I want DAN to do well because they are very fun to watch but if Snake have gotten their shit together they should 2:0
[0:55:46] goblinguy01: I figured Sofm can leave Mandarin pretty easy since his mother language is based off Chinese
[0:55:59] PulseIRL: Slight *** Kreygasm
[0:56:07] UsakPrensesiZarakiDayi_: @RiotPulse ty for comment <3
[0:56:09] darkblade83: watched sofm stream , he still speaks english with broken chinese tho
[0:56:14] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Tell me SMOrc
[0:56:38] PulseIRL: @lledaff Dunno, none of us know until closer toward the time
[0:56:39] ledaff_: @RiotPulse You will cast at worlds again ?
[0:56:45] ledaff_: Oh
[0:56:45] goblinguy01: Vietnamese and Chinese aren't close but it's an advantage
[0:57:17] PulseIRL: @lledaff I hope so though, I got offered MSI but I chose to do LPL finals instead
[0:57:33] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Anyways keep up the work man ur casting is sick !
[0:57:57] PulseIRL: @lledaff Thanks man TehePelo
[0:59:04] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Btw im a tsm fan lol, what do you expect them to give us this worlds
[0:59:45] ledaff_: @RiotPulse After the doublelift comeback
[0:59:58] PulseIRL: @lledaff Unless a lot changes between MSI and Worlds I don't expect a lot. I think China / EU / Korea are ramping up and NA / LMS are stagnant
[1:00:25] Sickosno: @riotpulse ur sexci
[1:00:53] PulseIRL: @lledaff Doublelift is the type of player who will win games by himself though so that could be a wildcard though that won't win Bo5s unless the team synergises
[1:01:12] PulseIRL: @Sickosno Kreygasm
[1:01:20] edgelordweeb: PogChamp
[1:01:25] Sickosno: What about the insane oce lcs PogChamp
[1:01:29] michaelsund: FailFish
[1:01:46] ledaff_: @RiotPulse They make some stupid mistakes like that baron losses if you watched them a lot and the drafts they did in MSI were just so awkward
[1:01:51] BettingDegen: PULSE ANALYSIS LUL
[1:02:30] hanu229: PogChamp E Q FLASH J4
[1:02:40] PulseIRL: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:02:51] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Also they are putting bjergsen on galio and he is the biggest carry in the team imo
[1:03:19] PulseIRL: @lledaff Every top tier mid laner is playing Galio though just because of how strong he is
[1:04:06] PulseIRL: @lledaff Like, you could put him on a high mechanical pick but why would you if you can play Galio who is easier to execute AND does more
[1:04:23] prof3ssorlive: Was that hook totally blind?
[1:04:42] ledaff_: @RiotPulse If they practice a lot for worlds and avoid the small mistakes they do, do you think they will at least get out of groups ?
[1:05:02] 甜野的小迷妹: not completely, there was a ward at the tribush @DarthSherlock
[1:06:31] PulseIRL: @lledaff Oh I think they'll almost certainly get out of groups unless they get Death Grouped, it's more a question of them getting further than Quarters
[1:06:55] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Thanks for the conversation ! love ya, hope i will see you casting a tsm game at worlds :D
[1:07:16] Heeylo: wait galio dont have nerfs in 7.12!! wtf DansGame
[1:07:56] Sickosno: The girl commentator has so good hair, I'm so jelly.
[1:08:24] PulseIRL: @lledaff <3
[1:08:46] ledaff_: @Heeylo There will be a galio nerf but its not gonna be big because tank galio already got nerfed but after the tank items update its so sick now
[1:09:28] Sickosno: @riotpulse do you think gangplank mid would ever be seen?
[1:10:37] ledaff_: @Sickosno There is a lot of better picks than gp mid unless a pro wants to have fun or make a surprise or he is so good at it
[1:11:18] PulseIRL: @Sickosno It's tough because he got repeatedly blasted by nerfs and even with optimized builds he kinda sucks outside of niche situations
[1:11:44] PulseIRL: @Sickosno He was actually played recently by Vizicsacsi but ended up losing, he tried to use steraks + new Death's Dance
[1:12:08] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Did you watch expect picking it ? still a good pick for a good gp player
[1:12:09] PulseIRL: That was top lane, however
[1:12:26] PulseIRL: Expect? Did he pick it competitively?
[1:12:29] PulseIRL: Or soloq
[1:12:39] ledaff_: @RiotPulse competitively and at msi too
[1:12:55] PulseIRL: I mean recently, as in Summer
[1:12:57] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Against skt btw
[1:13:04] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Oh no not in summer
[1:13:08] PulseIRL: Yeah yeah
[1:13:16] PulseIRL: I saw the MSI GPs
[1:13:28] Sickosno: Oh boy that would have been good to watch, I love seeing off meta picks.
[1:13:37] ledaff_: @RiotPulse To be fair gp is balanced right now at least
[1:13:43] PulseIRL: Played into Galio AFAIK
[1:13:53] Exorus1: Ks
[1:13:55] PulseIRL: But if you pick GP into Galio why not pick Fiora instead
[1:14:05] PulseIRL: Better AD picks atm
[1:14:10] Gunerdrag: PulseChamp
[1:14:14] Sickosno: I still have hope for uol to bust the AD TF jg
[1:14:16] ledaff_: Maybe he is good at gp more than fiora ? comfort pick
[1:14:30] PulseIRL: That's also a valid point, comfort is big
[1:14:40] PulseIRL: That's why when Clearlove busts out the Evelynn no one questions it
[1:15:03] ledaff_: I've seen expects fiora and he looks good on gp more
[1:16:05] Fuzz_box: TTours
[1:16:18] ledaff_: @RiotPulse I mean if you get a good comp around gp and gp avoids playing agaisnt shields and hard assassins, will do okay
[1:16:21] PulseIRL: Cat is actually my new favourite player

[1:17:42] Fuzz_box: This is a bloodbath
[1:17:45] ledaff_: @RiotPulse btw pulse i want to ask you about bjergsen, idk if its me or there are people like , i just think he is so good and can be compared to faker. What do you think ?
[1:17:48] PulseIRL: DansGame ing
[1:17:53] GLPhoenix: fiesta time boys :D
[1:17:54] Sickosno: FailFish FailFish FailFish
[1:18:13] PulseIRL: @lledaff I think that Bjergsen is still Faker's NA counterpart
[1:18:25] 甜野的小迷妹: That looks like my gold IV soloq game NotLikeThis
[1:18:43] Sickosno: Who does cat play for?
[1:18:48] PulseIRL: @lledaff The team was built around him for a reason though it does mean the team lives and dies based on his success
[1:18:50] Sickosno: Oh nvm LUL
[1:19:03] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Yeah thats what people say! and also the fact tsm is not showing up internationally he didn't had the opportunity to show up as the best midlaners do you agree ?
[1:19:12] hooleechet: How about jensen then compared to bjergy ?
[1:20:04] ledaff_: @Hooleechet They also call jensen , bjergsens rival but i still think bjergsen is better he always outperform him as tsm vs c9 unless c9 camp him
[1:20:27] ledaff_: @Hooleechet But jensen is still so good
[1:20:32] Sickosno: AsianGlow NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[1:21:37] PulseIRL: @lledaff I think that's a bit of a leading question, TSM just needed to play better as a team. Bjergsen could have done better but so could everyone.
[1:21:44] ルナティックリュウ: +582
[1:22:10] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Otherwise afreeca gave up galio and zac to rox in lck , and thats a big mistake i guess ! they are losing so hard
[1:22:35] hanu229: 0
[1:22:38] ルナティックリュウ: 0
[1:22:56] ledaff_: @RiotPulse And now rox are throwing LOL

[1:28:48] NguyenAnhHLN: does any vietnam dude in here?
[1:28:52] Fuzz_box: Somebody plays D&D with that Purple Worm reference
[1:29:11] PulseIRL: this game is an actual disaster
[1:29:20] 甜野的小迷妹: '玩蛇' is what we sometimes use. Though it means 'playing snake' literally
[1:29:28] Fuzz_box: These teams are both so hyper aggressive
[1:29:34] ledaff_: Idk whats exactly happening in this game
[1:29:34] PulseIRL: Dom is a veteran D&D DM
[1:29:54] 甜野的小迷妹: And snake named their series that as well (one like TSM's legends)
[1:29:56] Fuzz_box: @RiotPulse oh very cool. I love D&D
[1:30:17] PulseIRL: We actually have a weekly D&D session that is streamed by DomLUL
[1:30:30] Sickosno: This commentary is great

[1:30:49] PulseIRL: Dom / Me / Spawn / Rusty / Fish / Benji
[1:31:37] ledaff_: @Sickosno @RiotPulse is missing Kappa no complete cast without him

[1:32:53] UsakPrensesiZarakiDayi_: DomLUL
[1:32:54] ledaff_: The problem this game for snake is that j4 cant do much everyone can escape his ult and same for khazix he wont do dmg late on he cant get to jhin with that thresh peel
[1:32:59] FishRoeSoup: MrDestructoid =======C DomLUL
[1:33:01] 甜野的小迷妹: Kappa no I'm in Aus
[1:33:11] Fuzz_box: @RiotPulse I've thought about getting my group to stream our game, but worry that it would change the group dynamic

[1:34:56] PulseIRL: @Fuzz_box Yeah it normally would I guess but we're all casters so for us we just kinda forget
[1:35:26] ledaff_: @RiotPulse A question, when you casting do you have twitch chat on one of your screens ?

[1:38:06] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Hahaha good boy
[1:38:10] GLPhoenix: having it open is an unnecessary distraction for little to no gain
[1:38:16] Fuzz_box: Yeah, they would have to be totally focused on the game. So that their engagement is communicated to the viewers
[1:38:24] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Omg man im watching both games LPL and LCK fiestas everywhere
[1:38:48] Starforged_: 1670 dmg hit on ashe ok

[1:45:42] darkblade83: again with the comp
[1:45:50] Sickosno: Who is this?????
[1:45:57] Sickosno: Was he there the whole time?
[1:46:03] 甜野的小迷妹: just wait for EDG's game with IM @FishRoeSoup
[1:46:25] mamichon: Why did snake go for baron? They could have sent jarvan home and contested baron without engaging
[1:46:29] 甜野的小迷妹: but seriously as an EDG fan I want zet gone asap
[1:46:33] FishRoeSoup: @甜野的小迷妹 oh yeah its coming today Kappa lets see
[1:46:43] haruchng: thresh is so stronger
[1:46:46] ledaff_: @甜野的小迷妹 didn't watch lpl for a bit, did EDG get their level back yet ? or they are stills struggling
[1:46:47] mamichon: They just had to wait for mid megacreeps to push and they can easily take baron
[1:46:52] Sickosno: Her hair PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:46:58] FishRoeSoup: yeah deft to zet is one of the worst downgrade ever Kappa
[1:47:03] ledaff_: still*
[1:47:05] Ya_Eer: Maybe Riot should consider discontinuing this broadcast. It doesn't get enough viewers to justify paying casters for these 9 hour streams..
[1:47:23] haruchng: Caster what division?
[1:47:38] 甜野的小迷妹: @lledaff they won their game against snake but that was basically snake commiting suicide for two games
[1:48:06] 彩虹上的芬达: @FishRoeSoup EDG got a bad korean adc, the new chinese adc can play lpl at July
[1:48:26] ledaff_: @甜野的小迷妹 I miss the days when EDG and RNG were dominating it was fun to watch

[1:51:24] ledaff_: @Darkblade83 remind that if they ban shen and thresh they will leave other picks so they gotta sort it out !
[1:51:51] Ya_Eer: Plazlerasm TriHard
[1:52:00] PulseIRL: Alright chat, how long should the timeout be?
[1:52:19] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Haha forever maybe ?
[1:52:28] FishRoeSoup: @RiotPulse just like how long dopa is banned competitively on korea
[1:52:29] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Kids are going ham racist
[1:52:29] darkblade83: @lledaff snake has problem with shortcalling so having to deal with a splitpushing shen is a nightmare for them xD
[1:52:32] ShinyCharikarp: 20 minutes
[1:52:57] PulseIRL: First offense will be a timeout
[1:53:07] PulseIRL: If he comes back and continues then we go full public execution
[1:53:10] PulseIRL: So
[1:53:10] loatheyy: 69 half minutes
[1:53:12] PulseIRL: 20m?
[1:53:12] mainanalyst: no aussie casters anymore?
[1:53:21] PulseIRL: 69 minutes is good
[1:53:21] ledaff_: @RiotPulse 20 is good
[1:53:22] FishRoeSoup: @RiotPulse sure SeemsGood
[1:53:59] PulseIRL: @timeout @NIGG_OUT 1200
[1:54:03] PulseIRL: lol
[1:54:11] loatheyy: You tried.

[1:54:17] Team_Vertex: Is LPL BO2 or BO3?
[1:54:20] PulseIRL: Ruined KappaRoss
[1:54:28] ledaff_: Nailed
[1:54:30] darkblade83: bo3
[1:54:34] Team_Vertex: ty
[1:54:34] TheDalaiDonkey: !song
[1:55:03] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Do you think SNAKE will 2-1 ?
[1:55:12] 彩虹上的芬达: how does bo2 work:l
[1:55:16] FishRoeSoup: poppy PogChamp
[1:55:17] PulseIRL: Dan 2:0
[1:55:45] PulseIRL: @彩虹上的芬达 Point system. 2:0 = 3 points 1:1 = 1 point each
[1:55:46] haruchng: lol pro leagu is only Chineses?
[1:55:53] ledaff_: This split every single region is fiesta i dont understand
[1:55:57] PulseIRL: @Grhoss Yes
[1:56:04] haruchng: Thanks :D
[1:56:35] 彩虹上的芬达: @RiotPulse never heard that in china
[1:57:10] haruchng: Shen AD or AP?
[1:57:36] ledaff_: Tytanic hydra then full tank
[1:57:52] PulseIRL: @彩虹上的芬达 Europe has that system last year
[1:57:53] ledaff_: But it depends on the situation of the game
[1:57:59] FishRoeSoup: the good old wits end shen Kappa
[1:58:00] PulseIRL: Had*
[1:58:23] ledaff_: @RiotPulse The draw system or what ??
[1:58:32] PulseIRL: @zoomenhanced Huge. I think the mental game is more important than anything else
[1:58:41] Flitzferkeugah: @RiotPulse WutFace
[1:58:42] Vennntil: DansGame ing
[1:58:49] Flitzferkeugah: RiotPulse took over chat.
[1:59:05] Flitzferkeugah: Oh well. DansGame PogChamp
[1:59:49] ledaff_: @RiotPulse Why riot didnt try Africa ? there are a lot of talents in there
[2:00:07] darkblade83: i still think its better to have tank on the team xD
[2:00:20] FishRoeSoup: @lledaff "lots of talents" ?
[2:00:50] Flitzferkeugah: and why NA is getting chance after chance after chance. FeelsBadMan
[2:01:05] 忘川之水丶: Lack of foreign aid quota
[2:01:05] Flitzferkeugah: even though we keep disappointing everyone everywhere. BibleThump
[2:01:10] FishRoeSoup: coz NA has team owners like steve Kappa
[2:01:21] ledaff_: @FishRoeSoup Yeah, i currently live in morocco and esports here is developing a lot , started getting sponsors and doing national tournaments trying to tell riot that esports exists in here
[2:01:23] Flitzferkeugah: Team Liquid is a good team. (Paid for by Steve)
[2:01:32] PulseIRL: NA had to fight to get into MSI through Playins to be fair
[2:02:18] Flitzferkeugah: True. But we managed to fight our way in play-ins this year. But what about next year? I'm buying stock in EU and CH btw. KR dominance can't continue forever.
[2:02:43] darkblade83: blitz this game ?
[2:02:46] ledaff_: @RiotPulse I think NA cannot be removed because its riots residence no ?
[2:03:25] Flitzferkeugah: I think NA is gonna start falling behind, losing world slots in favor for playin slots. Giving wildcard regions a chance to get to the world stage, and NA will be there with em.
[2:03:39] Flitzferkeugah: And Wildcards have shown they have a-lot to offer.
[2:03:46] ledaff_: @Daniellrr IMO EU will do something crazy this worlds 2017 , FNC looks so so good as G2 H2K UOL ...
[2:04:15] Jackp0tta: 376 viewer PogChamp
[2:04:38] Flitzferkeugah: @lledaff EU talent is almost all home grown and they have A-LOT of competition at the top. It's not the same 2 teams in the finals over and over, that competition will drive the players to bring their best and the results WILL show. Mark my words on that.
[2:04:48] ledaff_: @RiotPulse So why riot doesnt try to make Africa a wildcard or something they have something to show too
[2:05:23] Flitzferkeugah: Also, there's a snake in mah boot. WutFace
[2:05:28] ledaff_: @Daniellrr I completely agree with you, EU has a lot of talents especially midlaners
[2:05:29] Team_Vertex: leona
[2:05:30] Flitzferkeugah: #DANWIN
[2:05:44] darkblade83: blitz!
[2:06:05] 青春那么花: DAN>EDG>SNAKE?
[2:06:14] PulseIRL: @lledaff I don't know much about league infrastructure in Africa. Maybe their scene will grow to a point where they become a T3 region.
[2:06:18] Flitzferkeugah: @lledaff Let's not forget ADCs. Zven and Rekkles are completely different beasts from the rest of the west.
[2:06:39] NguyenAnhHLN: eu lul
[2:06:54] Flitzferkeugah: I dream of a EU vs CN world finals.
[2:07:00] Flitzferkeugah: Maybe... G2 vs EDG. PogChamp

[2:08:22] ledaff_: @Daniellrr I rank rekkles one of the best adcs to be fair and zven too but rekkles has something special
[2:08:26] Samuka31: Hey @RiotPulse. I hope everything is going well for you :)
[2:08:31] 甜野的小迷妹: @Daniellrr maybe when EDG get a better adc
[2:08:46] 甜野的小迷妹: FailFish
[2:08:48] Flitzferkeugah: @lledaff Rekkles and Sneaky have always been on my radar for a long time. But Rekkles is really pulling something else lately with all his Frozen Mallet builds.
[2:09:18] 青春那么花: you mean huxianzhao?
[2:09:28] Flitzferkeugah: @lledaff I honestly love it. I play ADC in low gold, and while it's fun to emulate the pros. Rekkles is the only pro I just "cannot" figure out how to emulate. He has a special touch that can't be copied.
[2:09:48] 甜野的小迷妹: @青春那么花 I think he might be a better choice than zet but still not one as good as deft
[2:10:01] Flitzferkeugah: Deft BibleThump
[2:10:04] 甜野的小迷妹: Afterall he's just 17 from the youth team
[2:10:26] Flitzferkeugah: Come back to us Deft. KT Rolster smells like shrimp. TheThing
[2:10:36] 青春那么花: @甜野的小迷妹 but deft is not in EDG anymore BibleThump
[2:10:54] 甜野的小迷妹: So EDG might get better next season but clearlove doesn't have time for that
[2:11:03] 甜野的小迷妹: BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump

[2:22:12] SnailSama: 夏季赛人突然就变少了
[2:22:22] eslrahc: 可能是真的捞了
[2:22:35] eslrahc: 所以没人喷了
[2:22:35] Jkf13: 春季赛的时候疯狂屏蔽
[2:22:57] eslrahc: 湾湾怎么喷还是被LPL支配 有什么用
[2:23:57] Jkf13: 等7月的洲际赛的时候肯定大把带节奏

[2:34:25] SnailSama: snake阵容是全兼容的。。。
[2:34:39] SnailSama: SofM还能打辅助，Flandre能打五个位置
[2:34:42] FishRoeSoup: 上赛季那个mo辅助太抠脚，只好硬让队员灵活组排
[2:35:00] eslrahc: 灵活组排666
[2:35:18] FishRoeSoup: 之前是sofm先试辅助，后来才是水晶
[2:35:27] SnailSama: 各种换位置
[2:36:00] FishRoeSoup: 对那个人员名单里五个位置都有flandre，笑尿
[2:36:23] SnailSama: 几乎每个队员都是3个位置以上
[2:37:12] eslrahc: 乐观家族啥时候有比赛
[2:37:22] PulseIRL: @zoomenhanced Great question. I'd give the team 2 weeks off practice. They need time to reset.
[2:37:41] PulseIRL: They are going too hard with too many expectations for a mid-table team
[2:38:56] eslrahc: 感觉现在的dan就是以前的snake
[2:39:17] 有名字: 不是lspl上来的吗
[2:40:06] 甜野的小迷妹: Snake感觉完蛋了 Kappa

[2:52:46] Moobot: No links allowed (BaoBa00) (warning)
[2:52:47] koti_911: LGD and JDG the only reason why i watch LPL
[2:52:51] Infinfantry: Fuck all chineese
[2:52:55] koti_911: ^
[2:53:04] Flitzferkeugah: Be who you want to be 🤔 What if I want to be a apache attack helicopter? 🤔
[2:53:43] Flitzferkeugah: I like watching the LPL because I honestly cannot stand watching the LCK anymore.
[2:53:44] koti_911: @zoomenhanced got $500 on Ssg. easy win you moron
[2:54:00] Flitzferkeugah: Korean dominance has completely just ruined professional league for me. I cannot stand watching a LCK team anymore.
[2:54:05] FishRoeSoup: i like watching LPL because it is more closer to solo q games
[2:54:11] Flitzferkeugah: Same thing happened to SC2.
[2:54:39] SwaggyBT: Maybe NA and EU should git gud
[2:54:40] koti_911: @zoomenhanced Ssg is simply stronger
[2:55:19] koti_911: i have a kt rolster t shirt though
[2:55:22] Flitzferkeugah: Why? It's just the same story over and over again. SKT slumps early on, starts spiking mid season, compeltely dominates playoffs
[2:55:36] Flitzferkeugah: KT Rolster and Samsung follow and then ResidentSleeper for everyone else
[2:56:01] koti_911: @zoomenhanced either way, still a lot of hype
[2:56:13] Moe11436: GO IM SwiftRage
[2:56:13] SwaggyBT: Delta fix is ganna beat SKT
[2:57:09] Flitzferkeugah: @zoomenhanced I'll agree to disagree here. I just find the SAME team winning over and over and over to be bad for the health of a competitive scene.
[2:57:36] koti_911: @Daniellrr you cant stay at the top forever.
[2:57:42] koti_911: @Daniellrr it will be Samsung this year
[2:58:22] Papaxa6655: TriHard PogChamp TriHard
[2:58:23] Flitzferkeugah: @koti_1488 Let's hope so. Otherwise if SKT wins the LCK summer split, then wins worlds for the 3rd year in a row? It just... seems bad. SKT skin line is already the 2nd largest skin line in league. Where does it stop?
[2:58:23] Whatwehavelearnedisprime: The players of Longzhu have great potential
[2:58:45] eslrahc: which team do you want to get S7 champion
[2:59:09] koti_911: CuVee is better than Huni
[2:59:10] Flitzferkeugah: @koti_1488 League is still young in the professional scene. But the idea of ONE team being world champions for 50% of the games lifetime is actually absurd. It just feels wrong to me.
[3:00:11] Moe11436: was there a big pause between the games?
[3:00:16] javipn98: Who win ?
[3:00:40] Axel_Gear: @Daniellrr it won't last, competitive gamers have short careers, SKT will probably be medicore in another year or 2
[3:00:57] prigovor_: TriHard
[3:01:03] averagenormalguy: Faker already looks way past his prime
[3:01:31] Axel_Gear: way past? nah, he's just been studied for years and people know some of his weaknesses now
[3:02:01] AoiiKitsune: What's the biggest skin line?
[3:02:11] koti_911: Faker definitely not worth 1 million bucks, but he is decent
[3:02:35] Moe11436: Is DansGame team any good?
[3:02:43] averagenormalguy: I would assume every player gets scouted in every intenational tournament, but that still does not explain inconsistency in his performance
[3:03:19] Flitzferkeugah: @Axel_Gear I hope you're right
[3:03:39] Lenzo947: finally I can chat, screw that follower-mode
[3:03:47] koti_911: Put Doinb on a top KR team and he will be successful
[3:04:54] Lenzo947: so whos the strongest LPL team right now? haven't followed the matches too much
[3:05:03] javipn98: Who win ss or dan ?
[3:05:07] koti_911: @Lenzo947 Sadly, WE
[3:05:10] Moe11436: DansGame won
[3:05:16] Lenzo947: why sadly?
[3:05:35] flame129764: Xin zhao?

[3:05:39] koti_911: @Lenzo947 99% of LPL viewers are LGD fans
[3:05:47] jungchaeyeon01: guys who win the previous game?
[3:05:48] Moe11436: javipn98 DansGame team won
[3:06:04] 20point76erslead: Hi Tom
[3:06:16] Lenzo947: I thought ppl cared more about results than popularity?
[3:06:24] fanaarty: 99% of LPL viewers are EDG / RNG fans
[3:06:34] koti_911: @fanaarty that is just not true
[3:06:52] koti_911: @fanaarty imp has the biggest fan base, period.
[3:06:55] jungchaeyeon01: lgd fan here
[3:07:37] SnailSama: im every team's fan except for SKT
[3:07:41] Lenzo947: is LGD good right now?
[3:07:51] Moe11436: BigBrother
[3:07:54] koti_911: @Lenzo947 they are definitely top 3
[3:08:04] koti_911: which means worlds
[3:08:08] Lenzo947: they've added Cool to the roster recently havent they
[3:08:32] Lenzo947: well, people are just bored of seeing the same team win everything
[3:08:32] stevenzhai537: le guan fans
[3:08:40] Lenzo947: i think thats fair
[3:08:43] SnailSama: they just make worlds boring
[3:08:49] fanaarty: @koti_1488 LGD only had a lot of fans at the time that Marin played
[3:08:53] SnailSama: cuz we all know the champion
[3:08:56] koti_911: LGD going to bring hype to Worlds this year
[3:09:16] Lenzo947: i hope it doesnt become Worlds 2015 all over again
[3:09:23] Lenzo947: LPL sanbagging
[3:09:25] ctown1619: 傻逼解说
[3:09:27] fanaarty: LGD without marin = LGD without fans
[3:09:29] Voltiate: Blind Kass... OK
[3:09:42] koti_911: SSW failed but succeeded
[3:09:55] SnailSama: but LGD still has imp
[3:10:29] Tutturuu96: Look saying LGD has no fans without Marin is ignorant af... ofc RNG and EDG has like most fans, cuz they've done fine internationally.. but LDG got a fuck ton of fans when IMP joined
[3:10:44] Tutturuu96: they're such a likeable team
[3:10:48] SnailSama: zet only plays 2 champions LOL....ashe or varus
[3:11:08] Lenzo947: I bet GOLDV's Varus brought quite a few fans as well Keepo
[3:11:18] koti_911: Goldv is gone, hes history
[3:11:41] SnailSama: its LGD cool now
[3:11:45] fanaarty: @BestWeeabooo I'm not saying that LGD does not have fans. I only said that the fanbase declined with the exit of marin
[3:12:00] koti_911: @fanaarty that is not true.
[3:12:12] Lenzo947: you said LGD without fans
[3:12:14] koti_911: @fanaarty anyone with a brain knew that marin would not bring success to LGD
[3:12:18] Lenzo947: slightly overexaggerating there
[3:12:44] koti_911: @fanaarty the problem is GodV
[3:12:54] Voltiate: BOOP
[3:13:07] SnailSama: BOOP
[3:13:18] Lenzo947: LPL needs to stop relying on KR players to succeed
[3:13:24] averagenormalguy: When do you think IM hits the scaling here? 2 items?
[3:13:38] fanaarty: @koti_1488 Fanbase is not related to good performance
[3:13:45] Lenzo947: unless they have a good communication system, I don't see them playing consistently
[3:13:52] Chaotic_Old_Bore: cohhBoop
[3:14:12] koti_911: @fanaarty you make zero sense. why support a team that will fail?
[3:14:16] fanaarty: @koti_1488 i agree. GodV was the problem
[3:14:42] Lenzo947: bandwagoner spotted
[3:14:58] JaimeeeK: @koti_1488 supporting teams that fail is basically a meme in sports...
[3:15:05] koti_911: we all love imp, but his team was terrible past splits
[3:15:11] goblinguy01: @koti_1488 In what metric? If a team beats Korea, Support them? If a team goes to finals support them?
[3:15:22] Voltiate: @Lenzo947 So many LPL teams need to get smart management and then make players respect command
[3:15:27] SnailSama: some grills just support a team just bcuz of the handsome guy
[3:15:31] fanaarty: @koti_1488 Apparently you do not know what an LPL fanbase is. It is something very different from other regions
[3:15:35] goblinguy01: Why do people support TSM or Fnatic but yet they have my beaten Korean teams
[3:15:50] goblinguy01: have not*
[3:16:00] muslimituristi: Jeep AD LUL
[3:16:13] Lenzo947: because the fans support their regional teams
[3:16:14] Voltiate: Ok Mouse...
[3:16:28] fanaarty: @goblibguy01 I hope he has arguments for this. xD
[3:16:31] goblinguy01: How do we Guage team success? International or Global success?
[3:17:09] goblinguy01: @fanaarty I'm not a Korean fan but I see why they are good. I'm making a point, why support a team who can't beat the best teams in the world?
[3:17:29] koti_911: Ssg is going to win vs Kt xD
[3:17:34] Voltiate: flash?
[3:17:42] goblinguy01: What logic is supporting a failing team?
[3:17:46] Starforged_: PogChamp
[3:17:47] goblinguy01: Wtf Edward Esports
[3:17:58] koti_911: @goblibguy01 100% agree
[3:18:06] zekeovo: GGEZ
[3:18:07] JaimeeeK: May I PogChamp
[3:18:18] TooheysOCE: umm is this pro game correct?
[3:18:21] goblinguy01: By logic. No one should support Non Korea and Taiwanese teams
[3:18:25] 2208876468: lol 厂长
[3:18:27] FishRoeSoup: CoolStoryBob edg in summer
[3:18:29] Voltiate: I just watched AF vs ROX, I thought that series was tilting... holy
[3:18:36] goblinguy01: It's Edward Gaming vs Edward Sports
[3:18:50] fanaarty: @goblibguy01 eople do not hope for a team only if it's good. This happens in sports and e-sports
[3:18:50] koti_911: tsm lose to vietnamese
[3:19:07] 甜野的小迷妹: wtf happened Kappa
[3:19:17] Voltiate: @zoomenhanced No, the Korean fiesta was at the same time as the DAN fiesta
[3:19:24] goblinguy01: @fanaarty That's illogical. You support teams who play well win or win. DansGame
[3:19:26] FishRoeSoup: @甜野的小迷妹 mah boi EDG let's go GivePLZ
[3:19:28] 甜野的小迷妹: I lost connection for 2 mins
[3:19:43] goblinguy01: No competitive Spirit in these noobs
[3:19:46] Lenzo947: Maybe people just like players' personalities, look at qtpie when he played for DIG, they never got top 3 in LCS playoffs but the team still had fans
[3:19:54] 甜野的小迷妹: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:20:02] Starforged_: clown fiesta happened lul
[3:20:18] goblinguy01: Those people have a backwards thinking. Successful is Numbah One in Korea
[3:20:25] koti_911: @Lenzo947 thats why i like imp.
[3:20:32] koti_911: @Lenzo947 he is super cool
[3:20:40] Lenzo947: Yeah I can respect that
[3:20:54] fanaarty: @goblibguy01 Explain the TSM effect
[3:20:55] Lenzo947: what I dont respect is people who say that you should only support teams who win stuff
[3:21:01] Lenzo947: its personal preference for god sake
[3:21:14] Lenzo947: bandwagoners are not fans
[3:21:26] JaimeeeK: lots of people enjoy underdogs too, t
[3:21:28] FishRoeSoup: clearlove needs to stick to zac and olaf jg and stop playing mechanic intensive champs Kappa
[3:21:47] koti_911: @Lenzo947 ppl that say Kt will beat Skt simply bc they like Deft
[3:22:31] goblinguy01: I never said always root for winners. I said support teams who play well regardless of outcome. If a team loses in a competitive 5 games set, That's fine. If a team gets crushed 3-0 in 20 minutes games. Why do you support these teams who fail to adapt?
[3:22:45] Lenzo947: well, Deft might pop off in a game or two, but Bang is just too good, I don't see a single player carrying a team who has PawN
[3:22:58] Lenzo947: sad to see PawN decline, but its the reality
[3:23:08] goblinguy01: I liked Deft in SSB and EDG. He showed he is a good player by proof of solo carrying games.
[3:23:22] goblinguy01: Deft also learn to adapt to Chinese playstyle
[3:23:29] koti_911: some people pray that PawN will go back to his previous form and crush the competition
[3:23:35] Lenzo947: yea Deft played really well in LPL
[3:24:05] goblinguy01: Ohq and other Korean adc have not adapted. I don't respect most Koreans in LpL.
[3:24:07] Lenzo947: I remember that penta vs LGD in S5 Spring Finals
[3:24:11] FishRoeSoup: DomLUL
[3:24:13] Lenzo947: on Sivir
[3:24:25] goblinguy01: Imp, Deft adapted. The rest of Korean ADCs failed
[3:24:30] koti_911: @Lenzo947 super saiyan deft
[3:24:33] Lenzo947: Mystic is also good
[3:24:43] koti_911: @Lenzo947 that was extremely hyphee
[3:24:45] goblinguy01: My bad Mystic is good :D
[3:24:51] SnailSama: 累了
[3:24:52] Somatic9: He was also on the best team though
[3:25:02] goblinguy01: Mystic was trash in Jin Air. Good in World Elite.
[3:25:18] Lenzo947: well, he wasnt dragging the team down tho, he pulled his own weight in many games
[3:25:22] goblinguy01: Mystic is the only Jin Air player who had success outside of Korea
[3:25:38] FishRoeSoup: CLEARLUL SKILLSHOT 4Head
[3:25:57] FishRoeSoup: cass ult WutFace
[3:26:05] Lenzo947: I mean Smeb was also utter trash when he played for Incredible Miracle but got really good in a span of 2-3 years
[3:26:17] gtcobyy: blanc?
[3:26:26] goblinguy01: Blanc isn't good lol
[3:26:37] gtcobyy: was by far the best player on psg
[3:26:43] koti_911: Jinjiao is actually a god
[3:26:49] Lenzo947: I disagree
[3:26:51] koti_911: Keep sleeping
[3:26:52] goblinguy01: Mystic is on a middle tier team and with hard work Work Elite become the best team in LpL
[3:26:57] Lenzo947: WhiteKnight was the best player on PSG imo
[3:27:23] Lenzo947: got many advantages in his lane that he transitioned to other lanes and set his team up for success
[3:27:33] gtcobyy: whitenight is also good but he played 7 games out of 15
[3:27:50] goblinguy01: Mystic, Uzi are the top 2 ADC imo
[3:27:53] Lenzo947: well, he brought PSG from last place to 3rd?
[3:28:00] Lenzo947: I think it was 3rd
[3:28:04] goblinguy01: I disagree Frosk MingLee
[3:28:17] gtcobyy: there was no way he would be last place
[3:28:22] koti_911: Uzi always does some crazy sh*t when u least expect it
[3:28:39] FishRoeSoup: CLEARLOVE Q PogChamp
[3:28:43] Lenzo947: I loved Uzi in season 4ň
[3:28:49] 20point76erslead: clearlove is back PogChamp
[3:28:49] FishRoeSoup: HE FINALLY HIT IT PogChamp
[3:28:57] Lenzo947: the series vs EDG and OMG at worlds were insane
[3:28:58] goblinguy01: Uzi = Every Western ADC goals. He gets away with crazy 1v3-4 Flash engages.
[3:29:05] JaimeeeK: i may not NotLikeThis
[3:29:16] koti_911: @goblibguy01 is he still benched?
[3:29:16] goblinguy01: So many Western ADC want to play like Uzi. Look at DL LUL
[3:29:27] Lenzo947: p/b is on for KT SSG
[3:29:31] goblinguy01: @koti_1488 Aye for now.
[3:29:31] koti_911: @goblibguy01 yea i agree haha. dl is just trash
[3:29:38] one_more_plz: road flash 4Head
[3:29:46] goblinguy01: People have been talking about Uzi since S3 in Na
[3:29:59] gtcobyy: why does imay keep playing ben4 road ahh
[3:30:10] koti_911: @goblibguy01 if u watch dl stream, he talks trash when he wins against NA challenger
[3:30:13] Lenzo947: DL has good shotcalling and CSing, but if he doesnt get Lucian or something agressive, he doesnt stand out
[3:30:31] goblinguy01: @koti_1488 I don't watch Na LCS or streams
[3:30:33] Lenzo947: i dont like DL on utility champs, but its the meta and he has to adapt
[3:30:39] goblinguy01: I have better use of my time lol
[3:30:48] Lenzo947: oh, also DL's Ezreal is pretty good
[3:30:51] koti_911: Dl is chinese american btw
[3:31:04] gtcobyy: the problem with dl is not that he is a bad player, he just has about 35 iq
[3:31:07] Lenzo947: well, he grew up in NA
[3:31:15] goblinguy01: Yes. DL Ping looks up to his fellow country man
[3:31:33] koti_911: DL is not ever going to win worlds. he needs to retire
[3:31:35] goblinguy01: Same for Chaosx. Speaks Fluent Mandarin, it's why he went to Lspl to coach
[3:32:01] koti_911: Tsm play 50+ minute games vs lcs team
[3:32:44] goblinguy01: Do DL and BioTrash talk in their native language? We know Bjerg and Sven speak Danish in quick plays
[3:33:03] koti_911: @goblibguy01 who cares? they know they will never win worlds
[3:33:16] PulseIRL: Holy shit lol

[3:37:23] Lenzo947: Keepo
[3:37:42] Lenzo947: the era of KaKAO destroying the SKT organization
[3:37:48] goblinguy01: @lenzo947 Well SKT T1S and T1K did match fixing lol
[3:38:06] Lenzo947: yea, theres no way Optimus would outplay SKT S on a regular day
