[1:27:28] worlds2024: @monobeno why not
[1:27:32] captainkrajick: @monobeno there's this thing called A1 sports visa
[1:27:35] bet365_lol: @monobeno they might never return and claim refugee status (jk)
[1:27:45] captainkrajick: @monobeno sports visa. Esports now get sports visa

[1:30:20] monobeno: @Worlds2022 They're a very rich org, their house is very luxurious
[1:30:21] scottoflorida2014: Esports are better than traditional  sports.  The players aren't corrupted yet
[1:30:39] bet365_lol: @i_love_clocks its not a sport though, would you call chess a sport?

[1:32:13] scottoflorida2014: The ONLY true sport that requires finely tuned athletes is curling
[1:32:18] captainkrajick: he calls himself bet365lol but he knows very little about sports, esports, or League of Legends KEKW
[1:32:30] captainkrajick: @scottoflorida2014 true
[1:32:30] lVGa0: @monobeno he tried to apply everywhere even in boston
[1:32:46] hermeneutist: i'll bet he knows all about matchfixing once his team loses tho
[1:32:48] riddimgodkhuuster: a "sport" is not restricted to physical competition, that's just pure ignorance
[1:33:01] ÁÜ±ÁãóÁéãÂ∞èÈ¶¨: WE trash TEAM
[1:33:02] cannibalisticemu: @bet365_lol dude I was just with you in the LCK chat. DK NS game was boring
[1:33:04] i_love_clocks: If you get paid for doing a service, you are working so sports in the end, whether you like it or not, is a job so you are working
[1:33:06] monobeno: @lvga0 It's bad applying for multiple jobs?
[1:33:09] captainkrajick: @hermeneutist KEKW
[1:33:09] worlds2024: whats a sport
[1:33:09] bet365_lol: lmao these people are sitting in a CHAIR typing on a keyboard and clicking with a mouse they are not "athletes"  with all due respect
[1:33:32] ÁÜ±ÁãóÁéãÂ∞èÈ¶¨: WE trash team
[1:33:34] captainkrajick: @i_love_clocks well yeah, but they're not working for an american company, nor are they paying American taxes
[1:33:38] scottoflorida2014: C- at trolling
[1:33:41] bet365_lol: theres no physical excursion done, its not a sport
[1:33:42] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[1:33:45] hermeneutist: dude, esports demands a great deal of physical strength... in the finger-clicking ability and butt-sitting endurance
[1:33:47] ÏÇºÎèÑÏ≤úÏã¨Ìï¥Ïñ¥: G2 KEKW
[1:34:02] papayasmithy: is dis match of the weak?
[1:34:07] captainkrajick: @i_love_clocks I mean their salaries are not under American taxes, their winnings might be
[1:34:22] hermeneutist: @papayasmithy the *weakest
[1:34:24] BLG_worlds_2024: i will never understand why you guys always want to debate in this chat when the games are on KEKW
[1:34:26] riddimgodkhuuster: @bet365_lol a sport isn't limited to physical activity, thats just ignorance
[1:34:27] cannibalisticemu: @bet365_lol though they're professionally competing on an international level
[1:34:30] bet365_lol: i wouldnt call chess a sport, sure it requires hard work and dedication to get better, just like LoL but its not a sport
[1:34:48] papayasmithy: @hermeneutist ok ty :-)
[1:34:48] bet365_lol: @bet365_lol so?  my point still stands
[1:34:51] riddimgodkhuuster: then elaborate: what does esport stand for
[1:34:56] hermeneutist: is bowling a sport? is curling a sport?
[1:34:57] Kostthegreat: why is Dom not online yet?
[1:34:58] riddimgodkhuuster: tell me pls
[1:35:00] captainkrajick: @bet365_lol yeah bro, you too can play like them and practice for 8 hours a day too COPIUM
[1:35:02] MaryJaneUK: Anything competitive can be a sport. End of discussion.
[1:35:07] lVGa0: Breathe is the kevin durant of LPL
[1:35:08] worlds2024: monkaW
[1:35:14] captainkrajick: @Kostthegreat because it's WE vs RA and he wants to sleep
[1:35:16] discord_421: @i_love_clocks Working visa's are for long term in country employment. Going to iceland for a tournament is not long term, they do not need to have drivers licences set up, or need to purchase/rent homes for a few years.  Sports visa's are short term, for the tournament. It does not allow for long term employment in the country, or purchasing of a property as a permanent resident.
[1:35:21] bet365_lol: lmao people are mad because im calling out basic facts
[1:35:23] hermeneutist: heck even darts is a sport iirc
[1:35:26] i_love_clocks: @MaryJaneUK Eating contests are a sport? POGGERS
[1:35:26] riddimgodkhuuster: @MaryJaneUK yes. Someone gets it.
[1:35:38] Stormserpent101: @Kostthegreat I don't think he has any interest in this game, And he was out late last night
[1:35:39] hermeneutist: chess could easily become a sport if they applied with the IOC i'm pretty sure
[1:35:41] BLG_worlds_2024: WutFace debate and text walls
[1:35:41] captainkrajick: @bet365_lol yeah bro 22 ppl kicking a ball is soooooo easy bro I can do that, that's not a sport that's child's play
[1:35:41] iamporos: good job RA
[1:35:46] MaryJaneUK: @MaryJaneUK yes it is.
[1:35:49] jamespac123: @bet365_lol who asked you?
[1:35:49] bet365_lol: the people crying have never done a real sport and it shows
[1:35:57] riddimgodkhuuster: @bet365_lol ur ignorant and u don't know what a sport is KEKW keep being the internet warrior u are kiddo
[1:36:02] myprecioussosnowy: Clueless no way WE wins this game right
[1:36:09] scottoflorida2014: Feeding a troll who uses 2014 claims WutFace
[1:36:13] i_love_clocks: @i_love_clocks Nice to know, what about business trips that lasts a few days. How are those managed?
[1:36:13] hermeneutist: top chess competitions have millions of viewers worldwide, why wouldn't the IOC get in some of that
[1:36:21] captainkrajick: @myprecioussosnowy they have Kalista
[1:36:35] BLG_worlds_2024: mayahiChatting league is on time to debate about whether or not chess is a sport
[1:36:50] illiarashau: ez for team we
[1:37:01] taolacho: Fy is that you LUL
[1:37:10] captainkrajick: @i_love_clocks @i_love_clocks Business trips under a tourist visa cannot find new employment with an American company. But can perform whatever business they have under X amount of money I think.
[1:37:10] sorryiasked: ok, automod doesn't let you joke about pee
[1:37:10] Surlime: "real sport" btw
[1:37:14] hermeneutist: nascar racers sit in a chair and go in circles for an hour, is that really much better
[1:37:22] KeanoCS: Dumb chat
[1:37:25] papayasmithy: chess is a game. not a sport.
[1:37:35] bet365_lol: esports are not actual sports.  Theyre a competition and the people involved are extremely talented and train vigorously but its not a sport no matter how hard you sugar coat it
[1:37:39] riddimgodkhuuster: @hermeneutist exactly
[1:37:48] MaryJaneUK: @papayasmithy Learn the meaning of the words you are using. Clown.
[1:38:01] captainkrajick: Formula 1 isn't a sport
[1:38:05] riddimgodkhuuster: @bet365_lol copium, its ok to be low IQ
[1:38:08] BLG_worlds_2024: somebody just say some dumb stuff about league so the debate is at least league related NotLikeThis
[1:38:08] captainkrajick: Kappa
[1:38:09] MaryJaneUK: Staring contest = sport
[1:38:10] i_love_clocks: @i_love_clocks I see makes sense. Though it is weird to ask for a tourist visa when you are actually doing business.
[1:38:11] hermeneutist: chess can be very easily converted into an esport, just animate the pieces and make it have some nice effects- oh wait, that's TFT
[1:38:36] bet365_lol: @hermeneutist do you not understand the amount of G forces their bodies go through?  it requires physical strength to not go unconscious and keep the wheel straight.  NASCAR is a sport,,league is not
[1:38:36] i_love_clocks: Saying that chess is like TFT is an insult KEKW
[1:38:38] discord_421: @i_love_clocks Depends on the country. America has the B-1 business visitor visa, which is different from a working visa.
[1:38:40] Whalesdom: brock roflgatorPuke
