[1:51:18] originmorii: @glphoenix she's rarely casting when I watch, and even then, she goes in and out between games

[1:52:41] FishRoeSoup: PulseChamp
[1:52:46] originmorii: it's not even that hard to cast for a few hours a day, a few days a week. what else do casters do? honestly curious
[1:52:50] DolphinPriest: spawn looks older with that hair color
[1:52:52] KingdomsSword: Such hair PogChamp
[1:52:56] Teoadam: asian weeknd
[1:53:06] GLPhoenix: @Glacier18 are you serious?
[1:53:19] Bedroevelse: @Glacier18 LUL ok bruh
[1:53:36] DolphinPriest: u cant smoke as caster BibleThump
[1:53:39] applingling: he looked more professional with darker hair
[1:53:40] Bedroevelse: This job takes ALOT of dedication
[1:53:47] 甜野的小迷妹: one does not simply go up there and talk about a match
[1:53:52] GLPhoenix: for every few hours of casting, theres about double that in prep
[1:54:08] originmorii: I'm just curious what else they do besides casting. it was an honest question
[1:54:11] cantspeel: CmonRaz
[1:54:15] Ayluro: its not even that hard to do any job just go there work for a few hours. what else do you do?
[1:54:18] GLPhoenix: @DolphinPriest I dunno, tasteless seems to make it work
[1:54:24] nova914: only double? :P what about keeping up to date with the other leagues all over the world out of professional curiosity?
[1:54:41] originmorii: like, casting isn't the hard part. I figured there was more going into it to make it difficult
[1:55:06] DolphinPriest: TehePelo
[1:56:13] nova914: @Glacier18 Think about it like this. Every player needs to know how the mechanics of each and every hero works, every combo and the tactical and strategic plays of teams. Casters need to know all of that and see it happening before it happens to be able to cast it :P
[1:56:34] nova914: So think of all of the work outside of casting that goes in to stay up to date with the game mechanics, to stay up to date with the players and the leagues
[1:56:50] GLPhoenix: good prep makes the casting look easy
[1:56:54] Bedroevelse: And the constant evolution of the meta
[1:56:59] nova914: absolutely
[1:57:00] Bedroevelse: And you gotta look good af
[1:57:18] nova914: now, lets not give them ALL the credit. There's also brilliant people in their ears behind the screens feeding them facts and stats and tips.
[1:57:25] nova914: but they do a decent chunk of prep
[1:57:32] nova914: So its not as easy to cast as it looks
[1:57:36] FishRoeSoup: lpl native casters disagree Kappa all we know r random history and random poetries
[1:58:02] nova914: It's also surprisingly difficult to talk non-stop about any sport. turn the volume down and try it. You'll last 5 mins tops on play-by-play
[1:58:23] Ayluro: you just gotta be eloquent might look easy but if you were sent there you would go UHHHH ehmm err kogmaw lul very good combo uhhhh yeaa
[1:58:25] Bedroevelse: I was thinking of trying the whole caster thing, then I realised I'm a lazy depressed fuck
[1:58:47] nova914: I would do it if I could go 30 seconds without swearing when I speak... :/
[1:58:53] GLPhoenix: i cast HotS, so i kind of have a bit of an idea about it
[1:58:58] Bedroevelse: @nova914 SAME
[1:59:17] TidalFlux: videogames really made me swear alot
[1:59:24] Bedroevelse: I'm swearing way too much in my native language, not as much when I speak english.
[1:59:24] nova914: @Trollpappapinne Ah well... FUCK IT!

[4:52:44] im_moyo: which is better competition than most teams in the world are beating
[4:52:48] goblinguy01: Wins against bottom tier teams mean nothing imo
[4:52:57] im_moyo: and they played a close 3 game series against skt
[4:53:07] goblinguy01: If you beat Liquid 15 times, what does that mean
[4:53:11] Warwizard23: ok fair enough
[4:53:31] im_moyo: if wins against mid tier lck teams mean nothing then none of the wins in EU, NA, or LPL mean anything
[4:54:06] Ribbon1: Who won 1st map?
[4:54:07] goblinguy01: It's safe to Na and EU mean nothing

[4:54:55] unagi_AM2: safe to say that SKT would laugh at this match
[4:55:02] Warwizard23: i do respect G2 somewhat for at least taking a game vs SKT at MSI. TSM WAS MASSACRED by them every game
[4:55:03] goblinguy01: Dan Gaming vs Roccat
[4:55:34] Frostring: alot of G2's games vs skt were fairly close
[4:55:43] im_moyo: FNC, g2, msf, uol, and h2k are better than the lpl top 5
