[4:53:14] CybersIoth: LPL is better than LCK because of the playstyle, they actually have the ability to skill check and out team fight LCK and are very aggressive and LCK will never contest in a losing state

[4:53:26] zzanggaelol: T1>>>>>>>V5
[4:53:28] ye1l: put Leyan vs literally anyone and have the lanes be stable and he will have a CS lead. Might int or something, he's not the best at most things, but in terms of efficiency he's unrivaled
