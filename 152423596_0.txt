[0:59:47] DarkGaaraSand: @RideOnKush rakan is banned a lot in regions such as lck and lcs na and eu
[0:59:49] CasterFroskurinn: @RideOnKush his lane phase can be tough because he doesnt have much wave control so he was strong in the dorans shield meta but as we move away from that when it gets adjusted he does lose some value because the matchups can change back towards poke as a viable option

[1:11:05] varusXzyra: @bgijy1 ohh o_o didn't know about the turret defenses
[1:11:09] NealeF: Cait was inting?
[1:11:13] varusXzyra: @bgijy1 thanks!
[1:11:13] Machrus: @RideOnKush if you catch one of Gigabyte Marines' games in MSI they puleld one off to limited success, mainly it was a popular strategy because towers took more damage, now, not soe much
[1:11:50] bgijy1: @RideOnKush yeah thye implemented that some time back, because lane swaps weren't flashy enough to watch.
[1:11:50] sweezy215: cmonBruh
[1:12:02] bgijy1: And no problem!
[1:12:25] BootOfficiaI: yeah post 5 lane swaps are popular
[1:12:47] NealeF: Kled died outside of the map PogChamp
[1:12:49] BootOfficiaI: they're used to dodge tp disadvantage, first tower blood if u have tempo advantage
[1:13:04] Symphoneers: Amazing forgetting that his entire team isn't also Kleds.
[1:13:16] BootOfficiaI: and if ur comp takes towers much faster as well
[1:13:32] Machrus: What colour would you say Razz's necktie is, asking for a friend?
[1:13:39] bgijy1: They are akso used to gain control around rift herald, since if you get herald, it's almost guaranteed one free turret of your choosing.
[1:13:41] BootOfficiaI: purple nurple
[1:13:49] Cyrodilian: plum
[1:13:51] NealeF: normally in na or eu or w/e they swap bot lane up top, after first tower goes down in bot lane. because it changes up the pressure
[1:14:01] Stryder2020: #burgundy
