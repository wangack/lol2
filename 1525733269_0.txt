[3:06:16] fabio040202: Samira
[3:06:31] matthew_pyroboss: WE has better draft
[3:06:43] epsilon2k: sure
[3:06:44] AcexXVII: xerePopcorn
[3:06:56] matthew_pyroboss: only voli is bad in WE's draft but samira has been proven again and again to have a kit that doesn't work

[3:09:47] rayhawkke: @ayoub_ammor no ads right??
[3:09:55] bluesclues96: @matthew_pyroboss worst part about panth's e is that it blocks goredrinker healing because you didnt do any damage
[3:09:56] chatgptesport: late game who better?
[3:10:06] rayhawkke: @nebulaze_ any ads??none then gud
