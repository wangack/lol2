[6:16:55] BroderBill: JDG OpieOP
[6:17:07] hiuregod: @gautamkmr Icon isn't that good at all, they needed him replaced
[6:17:14] bjartscales: @chetehdez88 DoinB is just as bad as Tarzan
[6:17:15] zxasd198: icon is worse than fofo
[6:17:16] hiuregod: LNG need Dream
[6:17:27] Trottskee: Is there any other games after this?
[6:17:29] BroderBill: JDG already beat TES and EDG
[6:17:44] hiuregod: and a 2nd option for Ale
[6:17:45] mahreez10: This is not JDG but JGG
[6:17:46] chetehdez88: @laedarii hoy many world champion has Tarzan?

[6:18:32] hermeneutist: tarzan tho, has been having bad games so much that it's rarer to see him have good games
[6:18:35] Trottskee: @myprecioussosnowy Thank you!
[6:18:43] GautamKmr: i think the permaganking jg style is not working for tarzan
[6:18:48] GautamKmr: he falls so behind in CS
[6:19:03] chetehdez88: DoinB cant carry every single game alone. He has no team. Best player of all times with no team is sad
[6:19:13] GautamKmr: i would rather see tarzan on carries, and doinb on champs like taliyah lissandra

[6:26:34] asp1017: t1 doesn't even look that good but they clapped gen g
