[1:12:43] fakerofbronze9: H2K isn't going to worlds this year, that's for sure
[1:12:44] hanafinit: TSM C9 > G2 FNC
[1:12:48] mussjznedsein: they are rn
[1:12:55] Talentueux: OMG 2-0 so easily lol
[1:12:57] mussjznedsein: roccat is strong tho
[1:13:01] FlipperMeTimbers: C9 lost to immortals
[1:13:09] lokkiiiii: doubt a 2-0
[1:13:09] Envoy_of_the_End: Fnatic with the Kennen crutch 4Head
[1:13:12] shenzenian: jinoo looks like weixiao
[1:13:15] hanafinit: SKT > EVERYONE
[1:13:21] hanafinit: KKOMA GOAT
[1:13:23] mussjznedsein: twitchchat retarded again.. see ya
[1:13:34] hanafinit: gn
[1:13:35] lokkiiiii: icon usually does not perform well against cool, and Jinoo is a much better laner than Xiyang
[1:13:35] edgelordweeb: I think LPL is probably better than NA right now just from watching the games and because LPL has historically been better though CLG has looked really good
[1:13:35] fanaarty: smlz is the best adc in lpl
[1:13:38] SpaceOverwritten: @hanafinit inb4 other "super team" arrives
[1:13:39] Envoy_of_the_End: since when is twitch chat not retarded LUL
[1:13:47] Grondjuice0: Honestly no region outside korea has any hope. no one is close
[1:13:48] hanafinit: lol @月ホコリ
[1:13:56] Ruschev: Quality plays by lulu 4Head
[1:13:56] Talentueux: i think C9 will do decent at rift rivals, but TSM and P1 will get destroyed tbh
[1:14:07] fakerofbronze9: NA has decent teams, but unfortunately, none of those teams are going to Rift Rivals
[1:14:08] hanafinit: @greece_debt3 i think thats why he left LOL
[1:14:11] Envoy_of_the_End: TSM FailFish
[1:14:17] Talentueux: @fakerofbronze9 true
[1:14:23] killmepl34: TSM EleGiggle
[1:14:30] iloveuoft: LUL U
[1:14:40] Talentueux: @fakerofbronze9 should swap TSM and P1 for IMT and CLG
[1:14:43] Envoy_of_the_End: doesnt matter how good they are domestically
[1:14:50] Envoy_of_the_End: they always suck donkey ball internationally
[1:14:54] SpaceOverwritten: tsm performs "well" in the nalcs but for some reason they get bodied internationally
[1:14:59] lokkiiiii: LGD's comp looks really good, not to keen in Xiyang's Gragas
[1:15:02] FlipperMeTimbers: FailFish
[1:15:03] SpaceOverwritten: @envoy_of_the_end oh someone already said it
[1:15:09] Remortus: CLG IMT and DIG would be the teams I'd want for NA rift rivals but rip especially for P1
[1:15:12] Grondjuice0: hopefully KT can unseat skt this year. they are finally looking good
[1:15:15] fakerofbronze9: I'd honestly be surprised if Fnatic doesn't sweep the NA representatives without G2 or UOL having to play
[1:15:27] Talentueux: true
[1:15:31] Envoy_of_the_End: well we got P1 at rift rival FeelsBadMan
[1:15:43] edgelordweeb: what about dignitas though? they're doing really well outside of their slip up vs TL
[1:15:43] Talentueux: P1 should just forfeit
[1:15:52] SpaceOverwritten: @grondjuice0 that's what they said when they got the super god squad to take them down last time
[1:15:57] Talentueux: let IMT go instead of P1
[1:16:10] fakerofbronze9: P1 feeling grateful for franchising right now
[1:16:19] Envoy_of_the_End: honestly i have no clue why Rift Rival
[1:16:21] Talentueux: they won't get in
[1:16:22] na_cl__: P 0-5
[1:16:23] Envoy_of_the_End: is the previous season top 4
[1:16:23] urkinmagurkin: What is Cool's haircut called?
[1:16:30] Envoy_of_the_End: and not the current top 4
[1:16:36] Remortus: IMT and CLG would probably take a few games, P1 may just be an embarrassment
[1:16:44] lokkiiiii: You NA fans crying about P1 going to Rift Rivals, we have WE at their absolute worse going against the best of Korea :/
[1:16:45] Grondjuice0: @leftover_moondust true. although skt has looked worse this split. especially the top lane
[1:16:55] SpaceOverwritten: yeah
[1:16:57] Envoy_of_the_End: our only hope is CLG and C9 FeelsBadMan
[1:16:59] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End so it gives more incentive for teams to places higher in Sprint split
[1:17:09] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End spring
[1:17:10] Envoy_of_the_End: @Talentueux they already did that with MSI tho
[1:17:12] 抗吧凌风: dw na u have tsm
[1:17:12] SpaceOverwritten: then again if you think, huni has spent too much time in na
[1:17:19] fakerofbronze9: riot should allow the community to vote for their region's representatives, that would make things interesting
[1:17:19] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End only for the 1st seed
[1:17:23] 抗吧凌风: tsm honestly is on the same level with skt now
[1:17:24] Remortus: NA has our TSM EleGiggle
[1:17:27] Envoy_of_the_End: @Talentueux they should have just let Rift Rival be mid season
[1:17:28] 抗吧凌风: Kappa
[1:17:29] Grondjuice0: hunis stats are awful atm..13 kills 27 deaths
[1:17:30] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End now it gives the top 3
[1:17:35] edgelordweeb: @lokkiiiii WE is way fucking better than P1 is right now. p1 is terrible
[1:17:42] Envoy_of_the_End: @Talentueux it'll be more competitive overall and punished team that sandbag
[1:17:54] Remortus: You mean P0-5
[1:18:01] Remortus: Feelsbadman
[1:18:05] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End they don't have time i think and riot wants to hype up world
[1:18:11] Envoy_of_the_End: @Talentueux although i wouldnt be surprise if they change it next year, this is the first year anyway
[1:18:14] lokkiiiii: @edgelordweeb They lost to Snake yesterday :/ SNAKE
[1:18:16] SpaceOverwritten: @grondjuice0 faker seems to have been doing poorly too, I haven't seem much of the lck but still
[1:18:25] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End they don't want every team to face each other all the time i think
[1:18:27] 彩虹上的芬达: @抗吧凌风 我在抗吧见过你
[1:18:43] Envoy_of_the_End: @Talentueux i meant the current top 4 vs spring top 4 thing
[1:18:44] fakerofbronze9: P1 is substantially better than the worst team in EU (MM), but that's not saying much, they're still bad
[1:18:44] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End this way it hypes up worlds a lot more
[1:18:50] ne_danz: PogChamp
[1:18:51] Talentueux: @Envoy_of_the_End yeah
[1:18:58] Grondjuice0: @leftover_moondust faker actually did brilliantly with skt vs mvp. he carried so hard.
[1:19:03] 抗吧凌风: 那你一定也见过我的手下张艾宇和饶罗翔了
[1:19:07] edgelordweeb: @lokkiiiii ik that was hype as fuck but one upset loss doesn't make you garbage
[1:19:12] SpaceOverwritten: ah, I probably missed that
[1:19:24] Envoy_of_the_End: at least there's no wild card to counter CLG at rift rival Kappa
[1:19:27] Talentueux: @edgelordweeb true
[1:19:29] Grondjuice0: hehe huni played cass top and didnt do well...
[1:19:29] averagenormalguy: frost must be so hard to cast with

[1:19:58] konanbarbarian: items
[1:20:00] NahDawgDatAintMe: clg won't be at rift rivals
[1:20:03] heartbraek: its not frost, its fross
[1:20:04] fakerofbronze9: should be T5M vs GAM at Rift Rivals 4Head
[1:20:08] lokkiiiii: @edgelordweeb it wasnt just one upset loss tho, they've been looking really bad after MSI, got smashed at Demacia cup, and off to a really slow start in summer
[1:20:19] SpaceOverwritten: I hope huni steps up, else he might get dumped and just become this drifter going from region to region
[1:20:34] NahDawgDatAintMe: I'm actually kind of sad GAM lost 2 of their players
[1:20:34] konanbarbarian: rip

[1:20:46] Envoy_of_the_End: @nahdawgdataintme already?

[1:21:03] Talentueux: @月ホコリ after seeing the new skins he will dw
[1:21:07] fakerofbronze9: Levi was a f*cking monster
[1:21:14] Envoy_of_the_End: Levi and Optimus is their core
[1:21:19] NahDawgDatAintMe: @envoy_of_the_end it was top and adc
[1:21:22] Envoy_of_the_End: the rest are replacable
[1:21:33] Grondjuice0: i think huni will just back to eu or na if he cant pick it up. he isn't good enough to carry a team in korea on anyone else but rumble
[1:21:38] Remortus: Levi Optimus is a world class mid Jg duo
[1:21:39] Envoy_of_the_End: and they still got Archie for the veteran
[1:21:45] SpaceOverwritten: @talentueux speaking of the skins, where did duke move to?
[1:21:51] Envoy_of_the_End: @月ホコリ IG
