[0:43:39] Waibop: Good final match today Vibe
[0:44:10] ROIDRAGE9999: @ljpnb666 obviously not LUL
[0:44:12] Waibop: RNG won MSI so there's a real possibility sure
[0:44:48] 알고싶어요: @ljpnb666 Of course. LCK is weak except for the top three teams.
[0:45:35] fhh0425: lck have more fans than lpl
[0:45:35] ToTFlame: lpl bo3  every game lets go Kappa

[0:45:50] Waibop: lol yeah
[0:46:11] Waibop: Just bet blue side
[0:46:15] 알고싶어요: FYI, I'm an LCK fan, but I'm not looking forward to it. Except for the top three teams, their performance is terrible.

[0:47:44] lVGa0: I dont enjoy fpx games much before but when summit came to LPL i enjoy their games
[0:48:29] 알고싶어요: @yolo_pete DRX is doing well, but I don't think DK's form has come up yet. The biggest problem is that Bot Lane is su..k
[0:48:32] bkkz: i think drx is slightly  better than dk
[0:48:37] Yolo_pete: AL > WBG.
[0:49:26] bkkz: agreed
[0:49:36] Yolo_pete: @RocketDive98 True. Alos Canyon and SM are not what we used to seeing
[0:50:02] Yolo_pete: Zeka is cracked though
[0:50:19] bkkz: i just have a feeling blg wbg will be 1-1 and theshy will pull out some sh1t and lose

[0:55:52] 알고싶어요: I think T1,GEN,DK or DRX will be the team that will advance to Worlds LCK this season. Personally, I like LSB's performance because it's very Cool
[0:56:18] Juuniors: UP will destroy AL Zoom will carry
[0:56:32] Juuniors: BLG will 2-1 WBG as usual

[0:58:17] lebrontorunnningthruda6: sandbox good or bad
[0:58:18] lVGa0: LCK needs to expand their teams from 10 to 12 teams so they dont import players much

[0:58:49] HourlySword: KDF has a fun roster
[0:58:52] 알고싶어요: NS, KDF, and KT have so many ups and downs in their performance that it will be difficult to advance to the Worlds.
