[2:21:43] discord_421: @hotsingleyams Certain analysts refuse to properly acknowledge that the best game is currently being played out of LPL. Since they refuse to do that they, without watching the league, make pretty sweeping statements that other leagues are the best, and their fans go into LPL chats and troll.
