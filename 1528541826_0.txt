[3:12:48] Shadraxthegod: Kalista spear???
[3:12:48] padfoot1997: Kalista is one of the best early game picks, so you can snwoball hard from bot
[3:12:56] 哈哈哈哈哈哈哈123: RA let’s go
[3:13:03] hermeneutist: @Lightiwthin that's not the reason for kalista... she is just a strong laner + early game adc + secures neutrals, i.e. one of the best for snowballing early tempo
[3:13:14] tantrokyniem: Kalista always a top priority pick in LPL. You can destroy 1 lane with that pick
[3:13:28] glazzcannon420: Too bad channel points don’t give you an option to get free subscription.
[3:13:48] lebrontorunnningthruda6: caster curse
[3:13:49] Lightiwthin: @hermeneutist yeah I agree, just thought the question is based on a generic level but yeah in terms of viability she is pretty strong rn and it is undeniable

[3:13:53] lVGa0: JDG winning by matchfix

[3:14:28] Axeum: axeumHug axeumSip axeumEhehe
[3:14:38] hermeneutist: HOWEVER.... if your team sucks at early game snowballing and can't generate any tempo, this kalista pick = autolose late game
[3:14:40] ajagwapo: RA will win this game, same with FPX earlier
[3:14:48] shimaze_: who won?
[3:14:50] saliaamara: I'll pay more attention to her lane phase + objectives
[3:15:23] Warzard908: LNG win?
[3:15:25] hermeneutist: so you will see the traditionally macro-strong teams like RNG, EDG, etc try to draft late scaling vs kalista and grab jg prio
[3:15:31] Warzard908: Oof nvm
[3:15:36] glazzcannon420: @fred_birkhoff poor form I call it. When you critique pro players as if you are on the field with them it makes it seem as if you really don’t know what you are talking about.
[3:15:40] shyguyhihi: some random ass jdg team goes 7-1
[3:15:42] fred_birkhoff: beeee who you are...
