[3:10:08] LmaoLp: @monobeno more accurate than you might realize btw. jackey will actively bodyblock stuff intended for knight a fair amount of times (barely any other adcs in the league will do this for their mid, i think photics the only other one i remember doing this) and/or be the more aggressive carry/target specifically to give knight opportunity to do things.
