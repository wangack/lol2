[1:21:19] theomgfather: 369 has been 999 more than 333 this split for sure
[1:22:01] ye1l: @monobeno i think yagao is a big weakness and Kanavi seems to be a choker. On form they're my favorites but I'm not super confident that they'll play at their best
[1:22:33] GunnieSargeant: still no game?
[1:22:40] wontonsoup9000: bets
[1:22:40] Sylvanas_Windrunner1: yagao is a black hole in midlane
[1:22:46] GunnieSargeant: is this a podcast or LPL game?
[1:22:52] ye1l: similar situation for TES, Tian has super good form atm but I'm not blindly confident that he will play well at worlds
[1:23:02] captainkrajick: @gunniesargeant LPL game
[1:23:04] Sylvanas_Windrunner1: game
[1:23:10] jukujo13: was the replay old?
[1:23:21] ye1l: atm Photic/Knight/369 are for sure the frontrunners for summer MVP
[1:23:29] monobeno: So basically, all top LPL teams have a major choker. Kanavi, Tian, Rich and Breathe
[1:23:32] captainkrajick: @jukujo13 no the replay was from the future

[1:24:19] monobeno: I want RNG to do well, but Breathe is a bigger weakness than Yagao
[1:24:24] theomgfather: LPL always starts about 5 mins after the hour
[1:24:25] ye1l: i don't think rich is a huge issue he's just very volatile and relies on rookie to tame that volatility. For V5 karsa is the biggest issue
[1:24:27] M012345678: Here we go
[1:24:36] sodegurumajime: lpl really is ahead in ever way
