[0:50:12] Hemry64_: Bawss
[0:50:24] MagnaCarter_: They really should have failed the mission to show the issues you can face
[0:50:45] ReginaldXIV: tougher, shoots them once KEKW
[0:50:50] Jiinglle: monkaHmm they didnt seem that tough
[0:50:56] Ebra: there we go
[0:50:57] Weeblewonder: we couldnt be bothered making mutants so we just put a green skin on them
[0:51:01] fcsgamer: DONT IT LOOK FUN THOUGHÉ
[0:51:09] Imbadyoureworse: No
[0:51:11] Reijm11: I actually kind of like it
[0:51:17] Gertew: clearly KEKW
[0:51:21] Jiinglle: HUHH what
[0:51:31] Imbadyoureworse: I thought the insurance fraud looked funny though. That could be its own game
[0:51:35] BaconTopHat: They have been terrible at marketing this one
[0:51:35] MagnaCarter_: that's..not a metaphor anyone uses
[0:51:48] Thanator: Chalupacabra is a great name though ngl
[0:51:49] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: food truck? rooCookie
[0:51:53] Hemry64_: Is this gonna be on game pass? Because I can't tell if I'm going to like it or not with out trying it
[0:52:25] yunggoon1: Loa dust atpGasm
[0:52:33] appaomega: Sounds like V

[0:52:34] ritchie313: it looks like shit
[0:52:37] sarqon: both?

[0:52:40] Miros__: I'd answer you JP, but I fell asleep
[0:52:40] xarantur: it look unfinished
[0:52:41] Mrshilka: looks like last gen
[0:52:41] HadieHim: its very meh
[0:52:42] Nordud24: it looks bad
[0:52:43] Maklen5050: to me it jsu8t looks outdated
[0:52:43] Peardr0ps: It just looks generic
[0:52:43] The_Marlfox: It's very dated
[0:52:43] Ebra: it looks fine?
[0:52:45] KelticNight: looks underwhelming AF
[0:52:45] NYY_Tony: Looks like the GTA engine, right?
[0:52:45] xhaven: looks fine but not sure gameplay wise
[0:52:46] Hemry64_: They've shown things yet nothing at all it feels
[0:52:46] Gundevil: Both
[0:52:49] MagnaCarter_: it doesn't look great
[0:52:49] WhiteMilk89: looks dated
[0:52:52] dasmex: It doesn't look good
[0:52:53] Heisuisui: it looks 5 years too late
[0:52:53] Jiinglle: doesnt look great
[0:52:53] 3dlab: probably a cool game for 2015
[0:52:55] yraelvaint: This could be fun but they're not really selling it.
[0:52:55] KatjeMauw: saint row never looked good
[0:52:56] imnepse: uninspired
[0:52:56] Booba__TV: no music
[0:52:56] Weeblewonder: its a saints row game and theyre slow walking everywhere lol
[0:52:58] Nemoir: Physics look fun
[0:52:58] Lutcha81: looks great in 2010
[0:52:59] SlimmieP: Looks like saints row
[0:53:01] thesestrangenotions: Nothing going on in the gameplay, looks like a fornite mode or something
[0:53:01] Ebra: no idea why no music tho
[0:53:02] SZebra: Looks like Grand Theft Valium.
[0:53:02] Weeblewonder: zero cars on the road
[0:53:03] Laursi_: where's the crazy saints row weapons?
[0:53:03] Maklen5050: looks like a game I would have played 5 years ago
[0:53:04] WDPrescott_: THis looks like the same quality of SR3 used on OG Saints Row
[0:53:06] NinjaPandaEU: It looks like an Ubisoft open world game, but somehow worse?
[0:53:07] mathgss1: so generic, where are the fun stuff this series is famous for?
[0:53:09] Snoresalot: I will probably get it
[0:53:09] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: ive never really liked saints row but i do appreciate the style rooBobble
[0:53:12] Weeblewonder: huge pop in lol it looks garbage
[0:53:13] gregreg: never played any of these Saints Row games and not even if it's free
[0:53:15] fcsgamer: They are trying to make this GTA6
[0:53:19] SplatterDoll: It looks like generic saints row from 7 years ago
[0:53:22] Miros__: pop in, and basically noone else on the road...
[0:53:24] SlimmieP: Also no music
[0:53:25] Hemry64_: It also feels really generic, there's no personality
[0:53:28] Shin_gx: Feels like if the Far cry ppl did Saints Row and made it even more boring ijpKEK
[0:53:28] Ebra: where is the music..
[0:53:39] NullSignal: they shoulda went with radioactive mutants. that's a missed opportunity
[0:53:39] BuffaloTheory: @Ebra DMCA probably
[0:53:39] Kurozakai: honestly dont know why anyone would play Saints Row when GTA exists
[0:53:44] BlueSapphyre: dmca yeah.
[0:53:45] Nordud24: guns even sound bad
[0:53:48] Qritical: Knew this was gonna be ass lol
[0:53:52] Klassicoops: Ubisoft's Saint's Row YEP
[0:54:01] BlueSapphyre: @Kurozakai gta is too serious. i like the wackiness of saints row.
[0:54:04] BublegunPrincess: This looks like a game from more than 10 years ago AND without anything that made Saints Row good
[0:54:04] ChowYun: Ps3 npcs
[0:54:05] zzNamttamzz: Music won't save this gameplay
[0:54:08] zerohour_88: Kurozakai I quite liked Saints Row
[0:54:11] windgod2000: Yeah Music in Saints row is a big thing
[0:54:20] joshgrenon: jim robs KEKW
[0:54:21] Macroversal_: I just wanna watch Crendor and Jesse shenanigans.
[0:54:25] Hemry64_: @Kamurotetsu_ Honestly yeah, its pretty much what it feels like Sadge
[0:54:26] Dr4gonb0rn_: looks so bad
[0:54:31] KatjeMauw: Macroversal_ agreed
[0:54:35] SplatterDoll: Saints Row has kind of gone downhill since 3
[0:54:40] KelticNight: Saints Row was to GTA what Hot Shots was to Top Gun. it was an OTT pisstake. without the humour Saints Row is just dull
[0:54:47] MagnaCarter_: if it's on Gamepass I'll play it
[0:54:50] mathgss1: bad showing
[0:54:56] Hemry64_: But what is the story? they haven't shown anything pertaining to the plot
[0:54:57] Mallatom: widepeepoHappy coke time
[0:55:00] Imbadyoureworse: Good luck is a stretch
[0:55:01] KatjeMauw: 3 and gat outta hell were enjoyable to me
[0:55:04] LeKremlin: monkaSTEER
[0:55:05] Qritical: Just give us an SR2 remake so the series can ride off into the sunset
[0:55:06] Dr4gonb0rn_: TTS streams again, when?
[0:55:07] jmj1987: Try Lego's
[0:55:09] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: rooRave
[0:55:14] Mrshilka: sr2 was the best for me
[0:55:19] jmj1987: Jammies
[0:55:20] Mrshilka: I like the english boss voice
[0:55:21] LeKremlin: VIBE VIBE VIBE
[0:55:25] mathgss1: ijpNODDERS
[0:55:25] BlueSapphyre: saints row 3 is the epitome of saints row.
[0:55:28] yunggoon1: I just want SR2 remaster atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:55:30] Laursi_: I enjoyed 3
[0:55:33] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: rooBobble rooRave rooBobble
[0:55:34] mathgss1: saints row 3 was so much fun
[0:55:41] KelticNight: I got Saints Row 3 in a bundle, never played it LUL
[0:55:42] Hemry64_: @yunggoon1 I miss Carlos Sadge
[0:55:57] BaconTopHat: I still can't believe GTA still hasn't made the story officially playable co-op yet. It's the best part of SR.
[0:56:00] yunggoon1: Carlos face atpFeelsBeardMan
[0:56:04] KatjeMauw: just over the top gta
[0:56:06] ChowYun: Never understood the sr appael
[0:56:20] SchnellBier: I think saints row looks fine, like old school gta
[0:56:23] KatjeMauw: in a more childish way
[0:56:24] Shin_gx: @Kurozakai Saints Row 3 & 4 were actually pretty damn fun back when GTA titles were so serious in comparison, but they kept making the same thing over and over for the stuff they released after and it got stale fast Sadge
[0:56:30] zerohour_88: SR is GTA but wacky
[0:56:48] SchnellBier: I mean yeah wacky but not always
[0:56:59] SchnellBier: gta gets to a certain wacky level as well
[0:57:04] mathgss1: yeah I remeber the shark gun that shot blood and then a shark would jump from the ground to kill stuff
[0:57:15] BlueSapphyre: dubstep gun is one of my favourite weapons in any game ever.
[0:57:16] SchnellBier: but saints row especially saints row 3 and 4 are insanity
[0:57:47] cherry_badger: catJAM
[0:57:48] zerohour_88: 4 went a bit hard on the superpower side, it felt like budget Prototype at times
[0:57:59] zerohour_88: but the wacky guns were still fun
[0:57:59] Reijm11: GTA gets wacky but in a mostly semi realistic way, Saints row 3 and on are that times 100
[0:58:07] SchnellBier: I just think saints row looks fine since rockstar refuses to make new gta games I'm happy if someone does
[0:58:43] the043: ijpHI  chat
[0:58:45] zerohour_88: GTA Remaster died so GTA6 could live ijpKEK
[0:58:51] zerohour_88: the043 ijpHI

[1:01:26] Reijm11: @BlueSapphyre The GTA story games are worth at least a playthrough once, they are pretty good
[1:01:33] Gaulstar: limesDance
[1:02:00] SchnellBier: san andreas is still the best
[1:02:14] Shin_gx: @Mrshilka i still can't believe they were dumb enough to put that trash ass Rdr2 on pc and still refuse to put the 1st one KEKW
[1:03:23] DyingEros: Maybe KEKW
[1:03:29] De4dMaNz: maybe xD
[1:03:33] De4dMaNz: shit was a travesty
[1:03:36] mathgss1: oh man I forgot it was supposed to have co-op
[1:03:38] appaomega: Halo Finite
[1:03:45] Reijm11: might have a resurgence but probably to late
[1:03:51] vashaun: agreed
[1:03:53] DyingEros: Game was an actual research project on how to kill an established and self hyping franchise.
[1:03:56] De4dMaNz: yeahh it could of been so so so much better
[1:03:58] Shin_gx: Yeah i could see that
[1:03:58] DyingEros: Its worse than BF2042
[1:04:01] yrvengalied: it had gone through dev hell
[1:04:01] DyingEros: At least thats funny
[1:04:08] mathgss1: that is games as a service for you
[1:04:09] KelticNight: launched to such fanfare, then dropped off a cliff
[1:04:11] Gertew: nothing new from the Halo sereies
[1:04:13] vashaun: we were so hyped when they launched it too
[1:04:16] xarantur: i mean there's always anthem
[1:04:17] Shin_gx: Both from the single player pov and the struggles it had with multiplayer
[1:04:18] SZebra: BF2042 at least had some tremendous memes and stream clips
[1:04:28] Haeher: funny i never played Halo and when the new one released i only saw the hype then nothing KEKW
[1:04:29] De4dMaNz: people knew wat they were walking into with BF
[1:04:31] vashaun: vashaun subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[1:04:32] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing vashaun! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[1:04:32] DyingEros: I'd put BF over Halo
[1:04:35] Qritical: Worse than 2042??? Dude what LMAO
[1:04:35] zerohour_88: BF launch was terrible, but at least its playable now
[1:04:35] De4dMaNz: with Halo we expected more
[1:04:38] ritchie313: battlefield wasnt bad its just over hyped
[1:04:42] yrvengalied: BF2042 has now already surpassed Halo's Steam Concurrent players LUL
[1:04:46] sarqon: it was actually playable unlike cyberpunk
[1:04:51] Galthunda: Anthem. Fall out 76. Mass effect andromeda.
[1:04:52] DyingEros: @yrvengalied KEKW
[1:04:54] thesestrangenotions: Halo had further to fall
[1:04:55] SchnellBier: not sure when the last time was when I was hyped for an EA game
[1:04:59] Shin_gx: Yeah it was a massive disappointment but idk if the hype levels were comparable

[1:05:02] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Kaibasch! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[1:05:05] Ken_Taru: Halo 5 wasn't a "good" game
[1:05:06] mathgss1: I think the hype for halo games was way higher
[1:05:09] zerohour_88: Halo post Bungie Sadge
[1:05:23] LeKremlin: mathgss1 PauseChamp zekeYAY
[1:05:24] dasmex: Andromedia was actually okay though
[1:05:28] De4dMaNz: @Ken_Taru i would agree to this but H5s multiplayer carried it enough
[1:05:32] schlopytopy: the cosmetics to me in halo, on top of the fact that they were severely overpriced, were sooo ugly
[1:05:34] jeffrey_characterwheaties: fps has changed. halo just feels dated
[1:05:37] Haeher: eeeehhhhhh
[1:05:41] Haeher: not really
[1:05:42] windgod2000: I liked Andromeda
[1:05:43] DyingEros: It was a C- game at best
[1:05:45] Shin_gx: Was it ? KEKW
[1:05:49] vashaun: andromeda was what? who said that?
[1:05:49] Deathspate: Andromeda KEKHeim
[1:05:50] mathgss1: @LeKremlin friend! cohhL
[1:05:51] kapjak: Andromeda was definitely ok
[1:05:52] thesestrangenotions: Halo Infinite MP raised the hype on early release and BF has just been consistently criticized.
[1:05:52] k0jak: i think that's a normal take these days. it was an awful launch
[1:05:55] DyingEros: I gave it a solid 50hrs
[1:06:03] the043: andromeda wan't that bad after the patches
[1:06:04] larkhill: andromeda ended up as an ok game after patches. it started out a hot mess
[1:06:06] KelticNight: what's an Andromeda?
[1:06:07] zerohour_88: Andromeda was a game for sure PepeLaugh
[1:06:09] OnikenUK: would you recommend Andromeda if it's $5 and it's only one in the series I havent played? LUL
[1:06:21] Deathspate: It didn't ruin ME but it surely carried it out back and shot it multiple times
[1:06:21] DyingEros: Yes
[1:06:25] ArKiTroN: yes
[1:06:26] Dredstryde: Free on Game pass!
[1:06:27] appaomega: Overwatch 2
[1:06:27] dasmex: for 5? yeah
[1:06:30] yrvengalied: yea
[1:06:30] jeffrey_characterwheaties: game pass
[1:06:31] k0jak: sure if you want to
[1:06:32] vashaun: for $5 sure why not
[1:06:32] SchnellBier: well andromeda was just in a terrible state on release
[1:06:34] thrillhouse451: @Deathspate ahhahaha
[1:06:39] xarantur: @OnikenUK for 5 ? yeah
[1:06:39] Imbadyoureworse: Is that a whataburger cup?!
[1:06:41] OnikenUK: 🤔
[1:06:42] sarqon: it was good imo
[1:06:52] thesestrangenotions: Andromeda gameplay was what I wanted in ME 2 and 3
[1:06:53] Dredstryde: People we're never going to like Andromeda as the first ME without Shep
[1:06:55] OnikenUK: putting it on the list then, ty
[1:06:55] larkhill: i liked the story. it just didnt fit into the series
[1:07:00] Diabetic_Cheezeburger: rooBobble
[1:07:00] moist_heinous: nice Wonderwoman cup
[1:07:05] De4dMaNz: i thought andromeda was ok yeah.. it lacked multiplayer though, was just like a rough horde mode
[1:07:12] SirCris: water burger
[1:07:17] mathgss1: they gave the mass effect IP for developers with no experience and asked for it too quick, it was a predictable disaster
[1:07:18] zerohour_88: people need to see the story on how the Andromeda development was screwed PepeLaugh
[1:07:21] SirCris: that's what I heard
[1:07:29] SirCris: thanks for showing it to clear it up
[1:07:58] NightShader1: waterbuger
[1:08:03] Shin_gx: @kapjak idk singleplayer had so much shit that ended up being cut or never got put in later when it was supposed to, and multiplayer was supposed to be like on the levels of ME3 mp which was incredible, and that was and unstable laggy buggy dumpster fire too. And i'm not even talking about the bugs in the sp or the graphical issues
[1:08:04] yrvengalied: its not known outside of US
[1:08:05] Gertew: isnt whataburger only in America?

[1:42:20] Reijm11: yes
[1:43:23] sarqon: are truck stop sandwiches a big threat in the game?
[1:43:31] Omakie: huge threat
[1:43:55] Meis122: I dont think the truck is going to pass emissions
[1:43:58] Kalitsu: brmmm
[1:44:11] canucklehead2222: zekeCH zekeAD
[1:44:18] Mrshilka: many of themmost powerful trucks are old and will neve rpass emmissions
[1:44:22] zerohour_88: AnorienNightwish ijpH
[1:44:30] murasaur: just an EGR delete, no big deal
[1:44:34] Mrshilka: modern trucks are crippled by emmissions standards
[1:44:36] SchnellBier: I never used this truck but damn this one leans like crazy in regular turns
[1:44:41] murasaur: Mrshilka good
[1:45:10] Junaio: Sound of that truck gives me flashbacks to E'gars pest control truck in MIB
[1:45:17] ShellShockDelinquent: Clap
[1:45:54] murasaur: ugh, that strip of land
[1:46:18] Mrshilka: not saying the emissions standards are bad just a similar rated truck from today will do less inthe real world then older ones
[1:47:10] Mrshilka: its a reason why certain engines command such high prices ins econdhand market
[1:47:24] Radiag: i enjoyed first person with a steering wheel quite a bit
[1:47:26] Reijm11: there is gas on the way
[1:47:26] quaxim: I think so
[1:47:47] zerohour_88: imagine electric trucks with crazy high torques tho
[1:47:56] Omakie: for all the frustration this game brings it also brings a real nice feeling of zen
[1:48:02] Mrshilka: yeah once you can solve the battery issues electric will be great
[1:48:21] murasaur: Electric is already pretty good, as long as you dont need range
[1:48:30] BlueSapphyre: @Mrshilka better battery tech will also make solar and wind more viable.
[1:48:34] murasaur: very good for intercity
[1:48:58] miesals: damn  you can roll coal in this game?
[1:49:01] zerohour_88: I think electric trucks are already undergoing trials? haven't read news on them in a while
[1:49:01] Mrshilka: honestly convert everything to battery that we can and you could run less emisions safe heavy duty trucks and still keep helping enviroment
[1:49:08] Mrshilka: @BlueSapphyre yep yep

[1:52:14] GideonFaile: I'm pretty excited for King Goth the Lion's Dropped Frames
[1:52:17] MrJaycawbz: Seems like every game has a grappling hook these days Kappa
[1:52:19] Burepishta: There's one cosmetic element which helps, the one with more lights on the front
[1:52:22] Omakie: also this particular truck is alot better in high gear jp
[1:52:33] Omakie: its low is to low without an upgraded transmission
[1:52:35] Reijm11: Games like these always kind of make me want to drive trucks but then i remember all the annoying little details that games can skip over
[1:52:57] Mrshilka: @Reijm11 like haing to set thewinch manually lol
[1:53:06] Reijm11: Like there is no auto winch feature in real life
[1:53:09] Burepishta: Like a glove
[1:53:10] ReginaldXIV: Is this the new map?
[1:53:16] BlueSapphyre: @Reijm11 like having to drive for 16 hours a day. and hoping not to fall asleep at the wheel?

[1:54:22] Omakie: levy aint dry this time though
[1:54:32] MrJaycawbz: @Whitemage082 Unfortunately, it would seem as though the levy was dry.
[1:54:33] BlueSapphyre: tax payer dollars need to improve this road.
[1:54:50] ReginaldXIV: Someone should make a game like this, but you're an actual person driving and anytime you break down you have to physically fix the truck
[1:54:51] Mrshilka: time for some good ole boys to drink whiskey and rye
[1:54:53] Whitemage082: @MrJaycawbz no good old boys? to help?
[1:55:19] MrJaycawbz: @Whitemage082 Nah, they were swimming in whiskey. And don't get me started on how much Rye they consumed.

[2:06:21] tc2030: What kind of angle of approach is that:? lol
[2:06:22] MrJaycawbz: So, it would be dumb as F, but if you ran out of gas, could you technically just winch your way bit by bit to a station?
[2:06:23] Whitemage082: should have gas in the chevy worse case
[2:06:24] Khaoswarmammoth: oh well thats it game over lol
[2:06:32] freedout: one wrong turn can screw you.
