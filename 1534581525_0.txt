[1:21:36] BlameTheBunny: 6 minutes of ads, that's a twitch turbo ad right there
[1:21:37] Thalarg: Hmm

[2:18:08] SyedHaroonAli: NOPERS
[2:18:13] DobbsjustDobbs: @Eclipsedhusky it's marketed as an action MMO
[2:18:31] Eclipsedhusky: Dam. but figures
[2:18:36] aurice_heartly: I saw CodeMiko mkoWHY play Warframe yesterday and it was the funniest experience I have ever seen
[2:18:36] ProSkilz58: Just noticed JP changed the shame box to $$$_box for Goth LUL
[2:18:43] Jiinglle: That horse looks sick POGCRAZY
[2:18:44] pc2400: its just a story quest with a new mechanic not really a big mode
[2:18:48] Nund0: this is what i expect every style of game to follow
[2:18:57] 1manpizza: How do the grinders feel about this?
[2:19:18] Nund0: these f2p games will become a huge combination of games
[2:19:29] Nund0: all sharing the same source material
[2:19:35] xarantur: More Sekiro from how the parry worked
[2:19:39] Eclipsedhusky: I imagine the boss was melee because she chose Excal
[2:19:53] Jiinglle: monkaW
[2:19:54] imobaka: also really excited for Soulframe the new game
[2:20:01] Rentoray: monkaW
[2:20:07] Supwizy: It reminded me of the Fantastic four Galactus
[2:20:07] Altair900: Please note: probably want to play New War
[2:20:09] aurice_heartly: SoulFrame looks awesome
[2:20:09] Jiinglle: BabyRage in the sky
[2:20:15] xarantur: The devs did say that the paradox is set before new war or something liket hat
[2:20:19] xarantur: that***
[2:20:30] leovic1: ijpNODDERS
[2:20:32] aurice_heartly: passing WarFrame over to SPACE MOM is so awesome to see as well @itmeJP
[2:20:34] Eclipsedhusky: Paradox is before the Lotus story line, while also during it
[2:20:47] dotLAN: Indeed, very excited for this
[2:20:47] MrJinPengyou: Do you need to play 200 hours to get access to this?
[2:20:50] sch1z0: warframe is like madden/cod ppl they only play it
[2:20:56] iUncouth: saw on twitter that Reb got promoted, good for her
[2:21:06] aurice_heartly: She deserves it Clap
[2:21:21] Eclipsedhusky: MrJinPengyou possibly but its stand alone story for Paradox's story. You can also get carried through most story quests. Lot of friendly tenno out there
[2:21:51] cxselt: the fact that it's so differentiated from the core warframe gameplay and story experience makes it seem way too out of place.. if it would've been a standalone game or introduction to a new iteration of warframe it would've left a way sweeter taste no1UMM
[2:21:57] leovic1: oddly enough the parry system has always been there
[2:22:17] pc2400: @leovic1 parry angle stat?
[2:22:22] Altair900: The Warframe mod menu is a kill screen just like the POE passive tree
[2:22:47] Snowmancer: we are getting SOTC here
[2:23:09] Eclipsedhusky: Kahl of duty campaign story VeilBreaker too coming
[2:23:10] Shin_gx: @iUncouth Pablo & a couple other known ppl at DE got too, mostly because of their new game announcement with Steve and other ppl that are going to work on it
[2:23:29] Thalarg: also Khora
[2:23:39] Jiinglle: this colour filter looks fucking amazing as well NODDERS
[2:23:40] cxselt: ofc it's the drops LUL
[2:23:47] Eclipsedhusky: Steve has mentioned that announcements are always their biggest players coming back on line, not even the actual releases
[2:23:50] Altair900: SUFFERING FROM SUCCESS
[2:23:51] CorporalPibb: same
[2:23:58] 1manpizza: in game live event

[2:24:42] theSLiKbandit: Kahl of Duty
[2:24:45] aurice_heartly: @itmeJP rebecca also got promoted and is taking the reigns for Warframe
[2:24:53] Eclipsedhusky: Kahl is a clone that is now outside of his army
[2:24:56] Altair900: Last years was the most impactful for me personally xarantur The New War got me VERY emotional
[2:25:00] 1manpizza: A war-like
[2:25:01] Shaded_Rav: Warframen't

[2:25:32] RybackStun: do we know how account merges will occur?
[2:25:33] Altair900: Other way around Goth. Veilbreaker is before paradox
[2:25:41] aethybryr: ooo watch the trailer
[2:25:44] JaseLeland: souls like warframe?
[2:25:45] Altair900: So excited to see what Steve does with Soulframe
[2:25:46] 14neo: i am a bit worried about crossplay, crosssave and mobile - in terms of how the plat market will work, otherwise seems fun
[2:25:48] xarantur: @Altair900 i liked how they showed off nidus compared to Khora and then the zariman kids
[2:25:58] Eclipsedhusky: They also announced that the developers of Darksiders Genesis are working on a Warframe game as well
