[0:44:25] protegos: #SaveSoil
[0:44:36] Zempester: what happened to WE
[0:44:42] ke3hl: i mean game 1 or game 2 LUL
[0:44:44] Zempester: i thought they were a top seed like 2 years aog
[0:45:01] captainkrajick: @Zempester they were 5th place last year
[0:45:02] monobeno: Then say game so people can actually understand you
[0:45:11] ayoub_ammor: WE first win today ! WE BELIEVERS !
[0:45:12] captainkrajick: @Zempester then they lost toplane and botlane so they're kinda fucked
[0:45:17] monobeno: WE ran out of money to pay their star players
[0:45:29] captainkrajick: @Zempester but WE isn't bad even though they're 0-8
[0:45:35] monobeno: WE didn't even have money last year but players stuck together out of friendship
[0:45:44] captainkrajick: @Zempester they have a strong early game, it's just other teams are better because it's LPL
[0:45:56] HystericsCasts: 92 raiders from HystericsCasts have joined!

[0:46:16] HystericsCasts: Enjoy LPL <3
[0:46:22] Zempester: can teams get kicked out of the league due to poor placement?
[0:46:25] d9ajvcc: xD
[0:46:32] Zempester: or is it buy in?
[0:46:40] monobeno: No, which is stupid
[0:46:41] captainkrajick: @Zempester no, otherwise V5 would've been kicked out for being 0-16 last year
[0:46:42] HystericsCasts: Teams cant get kicked out afaik
[0:46:46] HystericsCasts: it's franchised essentially
[0:46:49] captainkrajick: @Zempester it is franchise yes
[0:46:49] monobeno: Relegation is the way to go in any sport
[0:47:30] captainkrajick: @monobeno I like a mix of both relegation and franchise, like in CSGO for example
[0:47:40] captainkrajick: @monobeno but having relegation keeps it exciting
[0:47:48] xrapidashh: is WE really that bad?
[0:48:04] monobeno: Having relegation will get rid of parasite teams
[0:48:04] captainkrajick: @xrapidashh no, WE is solid, it's just that this is LPL
[0:48:19] captainkrajick: @xrapidashh this split every single team has been stepping up. LPL is very fun to watch
[0:48:32] monobeno: You know, I'd actually feel sorry for WE if they didn't sign Smlz
[0:48:37] jaysanq: I'm WE defender, no WE is good (but not that good)
[0:48:45] monobeno: But they signed that paycheck stealer, so I hate WE, no sympathy for them
[0:49:11] xrapidashh: if they didnt win any game in LPL means they are the worst team in LPL right?
[0:49:38] monobeno: I think they're better than LGD
[0:49:40] captainkrajick: @xrapidashh yes, but doesn't mean they're bad?
[0:49:44] monobeno: LGD is the worst imo
[0:49:45] TocaRed: nice, 6 game today
[0:50:00] captainkrajick: @xrapidashh they look like they'd be top 2/3 in LCS
[0:50:21] autumnrainbells: @xrapidashh most WE loses were 1-2, so not that bad. Just can't win 2 games in a series
[0:50:23] mazeevelous: just 10 more years
[0:50:27] Blocks2007: worst day of lpl games fml
[0:50:32] monobeno: WE at least have a mechanically gifted player in Shanks, LGD has nothing'
[0:50:58] xrapidashh: i see thankyouu
[0:51:49] professor_silent: can we even win this one? KEKW
[0:51:50] monobeno: Xun needs to get his ass onto a good team asap
[0:52:06] lVGa0: Xun needs to be in BLG
[0:52:13] autumnrainbells: @monobeno UP would be a good start
[0:52:29] Obywatel_Swiata: Vibe
[0:52:34] monobeno: He'd be wasting his career on UP
[0:52:53] ke3hl: i hope WE can take 1 game Prayge
[0:53:13] monobeno: UP only has 1 player out of 5 that is anywhere near top tier, and that is Elk
[0:53:19] monobeno: Rest are shitters pretty much
[0:53:20] autumnrainbells: @monobeno UP ain't that bad tho

[0:54:43] autumnrainbells: Ya gotta cut Zoom some slack, dude was benched for quite some time
[0:54:54] jaysanq: zoom isn't terrible, just more of a role player nowadays ig
[0:55:04] monobeno: @autumnrainbells He got benched because he was so bad LMAO
[0:55:08] lVGa0: H4cker is the best he didnt let himself died just like he do sacrifice death to win a team fight
[0:55:24] monobeno: Zoom was the single reason TES looked like shit at the beginning
[0:55:34] captainkrajick: @monobeno He got benched because Wayward is the best toplaner in the LPL???
[0:55:41] Snitchor: 5k viewers on major final LUL
[0:55:42] monobeno: He can't lane to save his life, he needed Tian on his ass 24/7 which in turn led to TES's bad dragon rate
[0:55:47] chrisrox22: close matches today
[0:55:54] monobeno: After Zoom got benched, TES' dragon control instantly shot up
[0:56:01] autumnrainbells: @monobeno Well I mean if I had to choose, I would def choose Wayward for tes. They're like a trident team. Prob dont fit well with weakside top
[0:56:02] Cloudchaser9: AYAYA
[0:56:04] monobeno: If it wasn't Zoom being terrible idk what isa
[0:56:23] captainkrajick: There's more than 1 type of toplaner
[0:56:33] monobeno: Tian couldn't even play the game with Zoom on the team
[0:56:37] Dexteris: oh... bad match ups :(
[0:56:41] Lynvand: Fun fact, AL never won against WE before.
[0:56:42] captainkrajick: There's the Wayward type, the Zoom type, and the Bin type
[0:56:47] ken0ow: @Cloudchaser9 AYAYA Vibe
[0:56:55] captainkrajick: @monobeno Tian couldn't play with Nuguri either

[0:57:16] wimpodwarden: AYAYA
[0:57:18] lVGa0: Theshy 1v9  pushing lanes against V5. There is no other toplane can do that
[0:57:23] captainkrajick: @autumnrainbells TheShy is his own thing, we don't categorise him
[0:57:25] Snitchor: Top 3 junglers in the world: 1. Tarzan 2. King Kong 3. Mowgli

[0:58:40] POweeeeee: christ this song is absolute garbage
[0:58:46] autumnrainbells: @lVGa0 Wayward did a similar 2v1 against V5 spring split too
[0:58:55] captainkrajick: AYAYA
[0:59:14] captainkrajick: @lVGa0 @autumnrainbells But he doesn't tp into 5 people now does he?
[0:59:45] Lynvand: @jaysanq Yeah, or this'll be the first win WE gets.. Who knows AL is the better team rn KEKW
