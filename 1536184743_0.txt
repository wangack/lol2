[1:31:55] vilgefortz_egi: is gnar more dominant than GP at toplane?
[1:31:58] jetlagging1: @ayoub_ammor it makes a lot of sense.  it's similar to nba scheduling.  they put the most high profile matches on weekends and teams travel to other arenas when playing with audience
[1:32:00] discord_421: @cirobell due to the way that the schedule system works, the MSI participant gets the first week off. That results in some teams having more games later in the season to accommodate.
[1:32:07] myprecioussosnowy: it's for business reasons, LPL has a "match of the week" every weekend and TT isn't part of that rotation, they're bottom tier
[1:32:16] cnheil123: @enzadeninothefirst  lol every bettor feels hahahhaha

[1:35:58] SerPounce_AA: @tvbcom789 yes but why they don't have names in korean or chinese, just random shitty english words like Jerry, creme, faker, mark
