[0:45:02] Mallatom: think they were in talks with microsoft
[0:45:02] Grand129: Microsoft origionally tried to buy discord but it did not happen.
[0:45:05] Nemm__: Didn't Microsoft acquire them?

[0:45:43] Darkaros: 🙃 I'm tilted again by Twitch's VODs, the easiest way to find your VOD is to search "[channelname] forza" in that occasionally-useful search bar, but you can't find the dates without clicking on/watching the VOD

[1:17:19] DuneAlien: @Nisco3000 i think everyone understand, its pretty simple, sometimes people understand something and still don't like it
[1:17:33] k0jak: s8 was dogshit but like that has no effect on anything else
[1:17:33] Gnomeleader213: Would you rewatch GOT?
[1:17:35] aurice_heartly: the ending was fantastic, it should have won awards
[1:17:39] DuneAlien: then again i haven't seen it xD
[1:17:40] Makimachine: Didn't GoT end with Bran as a time traveling immortal god king? Kappa
[1:17:42] Nisco3000: @DuneAlien It's J R R, his story lines go insane deep.
[1:17:44] Shin_gx: I mean it's still a tv show at the end of the day, it's not the end of the world and it's been years now LUL
[1:17:45] DejaDrew: Its easy to understand. Just bad choices and a unfulfilling ending.
[1:17:48] Gnomeleader213: yeah
[1:17:49] emerson628: im hopeful for this because unlike GOT the story has already been fully written

[1:17:55] zucroh: on imdb says writed is Ryan J. Condal.. he did Rampage and colony. Not a lot of experience on this guy for such a big show, hope he does well

[1:18:27] WaystedMined: I mean the horse meme around GoT is fairly accurate...
[1:18:27] xPhire: For me "House of Cards" is still one of the best series of all time. Even If its mostly only season 1 and 2 fgsThink

[1:19:37] aurice_heartly: House of Cards is an amazing show even if Kevin Spacey is in it
[1:19:37] Gorn_Vernaleer: @ryukenchi problem is that there is no pay off later and knowing that ruins even season 1.. nothing they hint at has real meaning in the end, which is very sad
