[1:16:43] GIGABIN_Enjoyer: @lVGa0 pls use semicolons and colons. I understand that bounties create a comeback mechanic but a 10k gold lead should disappear because a single player gets caught before a big objective. bounties should be capped across objective and player bounties or atleast limited ot a reasonable number. People who outplay others should be punished for play better 90% of the time

[4:49:39] hermeneutist: then you might as well compare with UEFA
[4:49:41] oce_mir4i: just pick liss or something
[4:49:57] hermeneutist: the usual comparison is with LCK/LEC/LCS which have 10 teams each
[4:50:03] SenkuKiwi: junjia instead of jiejie? did I miss something?
[4:50:13] BLG_worlds_2024: @hermeneutist nba is a relatively global sport and the most global sport that average american knows about

[4:50:51] survivedv3: EDG THRESH
[4:50:54] chrisehhh: so basically Asia has the best teams
[4:51:08] emptyy_x: jiejie benched ?
[4:51:13] CJholder99: @Chrisehhlolz yep
[4:51:17] kyriakos0801: Where is Jiejie?
[4:51:23] jetlagging1: @crynter97 edg benched jiejie for junjia when he wasn't performaning even during their champion split
[4:51:24] monobeno: @emptyy_x Jiejie got moved to LDL
[4:51:30] BLG_worlds_2024: @Chrisehhlolz Yes, LPL, LCK, LEC, and PCS are the top 4 regions. 3 of which are asian
[4:51:34] monobeno: @kyriakos0801 Moved to LDL team
[4:51:37] akina_0623: Sett

[4:52:15] kyriakos0801: @monobeno what is LDL!
[4:52:17] chrisehhh: cloud9 where good at one stage
[4:52:20] vagnerlanches: Red Canids would win this EDG very easy
[4:52:34] kikixjj: @vagnerlanches COPIUM
[4:52:35] oce_mir4i: @chrisehhlolz always has been
[4:52:38] chrisehhh: 8 years ago at one stage or probably longer than that
[4:52:38] Squabblol: PCS top region LUL
[4:52:40] monobeno: @kyriakos0801 2nd tier league in China
[4:52:43] TheRealJayvvo: @Chrisehhlolz asia will always have the best teams till the LCS starts paying import players mental amounts of money, which will only happen when LoL becomes a household sport in the US
[4:52:44] alpha1250655: what game is this
[4:52:45] hermeneutist: EU has been improving substantially for a few years, G2 even snagged an MSI in 2018
[4:52:46] sshwy: I dont get why they let them ban tahm terrible coach
[4:52:46] BLG_worlds_2024: @Chrisehhlolz NA is not that far behind LEC but they arent quite at an international competitive level yet.
[4:52:52] „Ç≠„Éú„É´„Éà: Pain Gaming > LEC
[4:53:01] babithanjok: cool
[4:53:04] worlds2024: how can worlds winner go to LDL wtf?
[4:53:12] hermeneutist: NA has been lagging for a longer while, but recent 2-3 splits with the new orgs has been pretty solid
[4:53:13] vagnerlanches: paiN gaming is small
[4:53:17] CJholder99: @Chrisehhlolz c9 lost to the worse team in lcs last week, so NA is a shitshow as usual
[4:53:20] vagnerlanches: FURIA is better
[4:53:34] lVGa0: Guma and Keria best botlane duo in the world
[4:53:38] jetlagging1: @Worlds2022 he's not on LDL.  just benched
[4:53:46] Squabblol: thinking C9 is the best LCS team :/
[4:53:50] oce_mir4i: Red Canids > EG
[4:53:57] hermeneutist: at least EG, flyquest, cloud9 etc have been seeing solid results from their NA rookies
[4:54:05] chrisehhh: haha thats good but when I did play clould9 where topn5 world hmm was mostly eu and na teams
[4:54:16] chrisehhh: tbh
[4:54:24] chrisehhh: but this is years ago
[4:54:26] worlds2024: @jetlagging1 did jiejie play game 1?
[4:54:36] barnesbou10: Draven shutdown
[4:54:40] oce_mir4i: @chrisehhlolz dude how long havent u play league
[4:54:45] hermeneutist: EU has had lower local leagues cultivating talent for more years, so they've had a steady stream of rookies
[4:54:46] oce_mir4i: 8 years or sum
[4:54:47] chrisehhh: like maybe 10
[4:54:52] chrisehhh: 8 years
[4:54:54] emptyy_x: @Worlds2022 jiejie got traded
[4:54:54] vagnerlanches: Red Canids win this wolrds
[4:54:58] TheRealJayvvo: @Chrisehhlolz The best LCS team of each split could probably get top 4 in LEC but the rest of LCS would compete with LECs bottom two
[4:55:00] vagnerlanches: worlds*
[4:55:03] jetlagging1: @Worlds2022 nope.  knowing EDG they'll probably play jiejie next series.  Just give him sometime to get his shit together
[4:55:35] chrisehhh: but when  I was playing competievly was longer
[4:55:35] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
