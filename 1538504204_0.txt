[1:02:38] Sammonoske: opps Not being sore doesn't mean you're not making progress
[1:02:38] DangerRangerRex: not necessarily
[1:02:39] zerohour_88: progression, add a bit more load if you can

[1:32:12] NickLeonhearth: Still better than suffering brain damage in america football @itmeJP
[1:32:13] EvilBuho: @itmeJP  technically they don't have to do that, but they do to stop the ball from the penalty
[1:32:18] TORIwoo: Thats the point, to let the ball hit you and block it

[1:39:53] dFaroda: I wonder if the emu will work day one for XB3.
[1:39:54] Norrak1: This is like a condensed version of that
[1:39:55] genericnumber: I like the art, but just doesn't look great compared to the tech-focused trailers we were just watching
[1:40:00] buzzkillington_: Yeah. Pretty sure this is just a condenced version of the direct
[1:40:02] NaughtyPedro: do you need to play the other 2 games?
[1:40:06] zerohour_88: @Hundisilm the art style is good, the resolution/fidelity is terrible due to switch

[1:42:21] Wamblo_: Chat surprised a switch game looks like a switch game
[1:42:22] Gytax_: Curious though, don't developers complain to Nintendo that their hardware is just not up to snuff anymore and it limits what they can do? Especially developers who exclusively develop for the Switch?
[1:42:28] kannart_: AYAYA
[1:42:29] Darkaros: AYAYA gattai

[1:43:12] jeffrey_characterwheaties: everything looks like genshin..
[1:43:13] Riluske: Is this trailer old, or are they just recycling other trailers?
[1:43:15] DraulTheVikingFox: example of a could be great game being held back by the console
[1:43:16] Wamblo_: Just saying, there is a decent Switch emu with upscaling and 60 fps
[1:43:24] SgtStruthers: More fps in a renaissance painting
[1:43:31] Norrak1: @jeffrey_characterwheaties Or you know it looks like Xenoblade 1 and 2 which came out years before
[1:43:32] KelticNight: Young Brog is my rap name
[1:43:38] countmarcula: look forward to playing this on Yuzu
[1:43:40] Kersenka: I would like to play this, but the FPS would kill me. WTF are nintendo doing
[1:43:41] jeffrey_characterwheaties: the font??
[1:43:46] Kyanilis: @Riluske trailer is new but it's all old info/footage yeah. Everything in it has been shown before several times

[2:09:33] Veshok: why wouldn't they just disable all chat functions

[2:10:03] zerohour_88: I used to run teleport as a support back in s2, thank god I wasn't in NA ijpKEK
[2:10:04] Nuke_Fusion_: how's the LOL goin'?
[2:10:25] fells: @Nuke_Fusion_ probably not best time to ask that.
[2:10:29] lilfuzz: @Veshok chat is necessary for team callouts, so it's a blessing and a curse
[2:10:40] afreak10: if they don't hold u hostage

[2:10:53] Nuke_Fusion_: that's good huh Madge
[2:10:57] Fateborn: So this Renata is playing like this because JP picked smite on accident? evoThink
[2:11:01] TORIwoo: he's trolling, its 30 min + game
[2:11:04] spacemarine55: This is the shit I see every day in gold
[2:11:07] Miros__: @lilfuzz I mean, I survive on pings alone
[2:11:15] Veshok: @lilfuzz yeah but pings are enough to do so. I disabled team and all chat more than a year ago and play just fine without. Mental was never better
[2:11:34] Darkaros: @Fateborn no, he thought Ashe (Sacriel) was trolling because he saw Domination rune (? his runes are fine)
[2:11:54] lilfuzz: @Miros__ I know in smite, peeople like to post times that someone used an active, so that way the team knows how long the enemies active is down for. That is very valuable
[2:12:00] zerohour_88: I want to say pretend its S3 and you're doing a lane swap but this is terrible ijpKEK
[2:12:04] AtheistVeganNihilist: I mean, the game is still winnable

[2:12:19] Veshok: @lilfuzz nobody does that below diamond rank in league lol
[2:12:19] Miros__: @lilfuzz not so much in silver
[2:12:46] TORIwoo: @Fateborn Nah, its he just a troll, no one feeds because of runes, peaople pick shit runes all the time
[2:12:48] IssacMc: their morgana coming top is actually a hurting them
[2:13:21] lilfuzz: @Veshok so I guess disable it for all who are below diamond?
[2:13:49] Veshok: @lilfuzz I'd say so yeah. Not missing out on much
[2:14:26] lilfuzz: @Veshok Yeah I guess, but let's be honest, there's plenty of other ways players can vent out their toxicity
[2:14:32] ワフルデラ: Bronze in EUW pings summoners all the time
[2:14:52] ワフルデラ: NA sounds like an hell to play in
[2:15:12] Veshok: @lilfuzz  true, you can't prevent someone target inting or just afking or something. But if you can just avoid the flame and hate that still a big plus in my book.
[2:15:18] Miros__: miiight be a good time to muteall JP..
[2:15:27] Darkaros: getting secondhand tilt from this support ijpSUFFER
[2:15:32] Miros__: ^
[2:15:45] Riluske: same @Darkaros
[2:15:52] ワフルデラ: Rennata going for the three fer Pog
[2:15:57] zerohour_88: I play MOBA in SEA ijpSUFFER and even tho there are still dumbasses, everyone fights till the end/ff
[2:15:59] Veshok: @lilfuzz also all the typing distracts from just playing the game.
[2:16:20] lilfuzz: @Veshok It's the nature of MOBAS. It's more toxic than most competitive games purely because random players have so much influence over the entire teams potential
[2:16:34] IssacMc: no its 100% a duo
[2:16:43] zerohour_88: don't you get matched with other duos too?
[2:16:44] Neragsito: the bully is popular, I want to be friends with him
[2:16:56] ElSpartin: voli
[2:16:59] ワフルデラ: voli
[2:16:59] Veshok: you ate voli xD
[2:16:59] Neragsito: you ate the voli
[2:17:06] IssacMc: @zerohour_88 it increases your chances
[2:17:19] Jukettaja: Ooh that root into MF ult was rough
[2:17:28] m3rcer: yep
[2:17:32] PangieV: yeah
[2:18:04] ワフルデラ: probably? but voli is also giant
[2:18:15] BlueSapphyre: voli hitbox is also huge.
[2:18:16] ritchie313: looks like voly and renata are duo
[2:18:27] camdunne: @itmeJP The voli and Renata are duod
[2:18:45] ElSpartin: hpw can you check that chat?
[2:18:57] Manse06: They had to duo so they could outnumber their braincells
[2:19:00] angryturk: does opgg show that info still?
[2:19:28] SawyerStreamsStuff: yeah
[2:19:29] zerohour_88: you can check their past games and then compare, I assume?
[2:19:34] bulletsponge55: not to mention he fed a kill before he fucked off to ruin your lane
[2:19:42] iamjustacow: lol wow, I don't miss bronze
[2:20:01] Nuke_Fusion_: well that's the majority of earth's population LUL
[2:20:02] Jukettaja: Yeah they don't realise that even if everyone did what they asked, the outcome would be even worse
[2:20:04] Obivanbeegees: The best thing i ever did in a game was mute all chat
[2:20:06] ワフルデラ: mid feels like a 9-5 young adult trying to play his games for the day, I feel for him
[2:20:16] lilfuzz: I've noticed MOBAS really put a spotlight on how much critical thinking skills people lack
[2:20:21] Nex210: watching stuff like this makes me glad i decided on a child free life LUL
[2:20:27] Jukettaja: This Volibear is on a mission
[2:20:37] Jukettaja: At least Pantheon wasn't there

[2:23:07] zerohour_88: that Ashe ult hit but Synd couldn't one shot still I think
[2:23:28] lilfuzz: I dont play this game but that seemed like an obnoxiously long CC
[2:24:08] zerohour_88: its relatively long for League, at least, but you have to hit with it LUL
[2:24:15] Valask: Pog

[2:25:37] FatLasha: 0 ward support wth is renata doing?
[2:25:46] Valask: have they added any swing or comeback mechanics to League
[2:26:05] Veshok: The beauty of leage: Sometimes you just have to wait until the enemies outplay themselves
[2:26:13] Darkaros: they added objective bounties a while ago
[2:26:17] Miros__: @Valask sortof.... if your team is behind, map objectives can be worth more
[2:26:18] BuggleStrus: @Valask There's objective bounties that give your team gold if you're behind
[2:26:20] Veshok: @Valask there are gold bounties. notice the yellow border on the towers
[2:26:26] v3rt3x: @Valask bounties, that's why the enemy objectives and neutral ones have borders
[2:26:43] Valask: so much attention capWideTide1 capWideTide2
[2:27:37] br4nd0nh347: oh my that syndra
[2:28:48] lilfuzz: If you cant think of any kind of blame, just blame support

[2:29:50] BroqRox: that was a warming?
[2:29:51] BuggleStrus: games like this are why i don't have in-game chat on
[2:29:54] BroqRox: monkaW
[2:29:59] Darkaros: The only silver lining is JP having a friend to vent with ijpSUFFER
[2:30:03] Valask: this isn't Sac's first rodeo in League is it monkaW
[2:30:04] Reckless_Rob: Were all having fun here :)
[2:30:11] zerohour_88: suffering with friends ijpKEK
[2:30:12] GameOnlyNoTalk: @Valask gives you life but takes your soul
[2:30:14] dasmex: pls rito do the right thing
[2:30:21] Tetracyclin: Report for bad player Kappa
[2:30:48] Fuji_5: You got this JP! We believe in you
[2:30:52] Valask: you need to do it compulsively or not at all
[2:30:57] TDotTerror: Oh, the misery...
[2:30:58] Veshok: @itmeJP why don't you disable chat?
[2:31:11] BDave: some people are sadomasochistic though :D

[2:31:42] WaywornCypress: ?
[2:31:45] Valask: some things never change ijpKEK
[2:31:45] Tetracyclin: It's the idealist stance to not disable chat
[2:31:57] Fuji_5: yeah a lot of the pro League streamers say, mute all is a better experience
[2:32:08] Valask: Do you actually benefit from chat in any way that pings do not provide
[2:32:12] Insigmada: ijpHI jp and chat ijpLOVE

[2:35:33] Nyx187: w first then q for ashe
[2:35:43] Valask: Chat, which role in League is usually coping, which one is malding, and which one is seething?
[2:35:52] Fateborn: W -> Q -> E is the preferred order for Ashe.
[2:36:06] PangieV: @Valask whichever role has a person playing it =)

[2:38:10] Joalni: @Theawesomesoccer2 So from a certain point of view...
[2:38:34] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: they don't have a tank so if he doesn't hard when lane (ai up two or three kills or 60+ cs) you should win lane
[2:38:38] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: Game*
[2:39:18] Nako_Bocchi: they don't have a lot of CC, so if you just get tabis and bramble vest, it's an ez lane stripHmm

[3:19:26] Dieelon: mid can carry a game
[3:19:34] Miros__: ADC can carry better than support
[3:19:49] Theawesomesoccer2: i think the best solution is to play a carry 'support' like brand or lux
[3:19:49] Killian_Hart: a good kill support can take over the carry role
[3:19:59] InsidiousKettle: play swain support and carry anyway
[3:20:02] SouthernBiscuits: Senna can transition into carry pretty easily
[3:20:14] tripstn: or play yuumi and just sit on most fed person KEKW
[3:20:18] Tangilizer: yeah nowadays support can carry so much more than when i was playing
[3:20:30] AtheistVeganNihilist: Adc can’t carry because they die instantly late game, supports making plays carry more then adc’s generally now
[3:20:51] ワフルデラ: roaming support needs game knowledge tho
[3:20:58] Nako_Bocchi: I remember when all supports did was buy the gp10 item and just buy ungodly amounts of wards ijpOLD

[3:38:54] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @itmeJP  you know you can get it so that it will always have your pots on 3 if you want

[3:41:17] ReginaldXIV: peepoRun SPEEDERS 💩
[3:41:19] titanodin: lol that last nasus kill was prob 3k alone
[3:41:19] ワフルデラ: so fun mobile news
[3:41:43] ワフルデラ: Google Play is region locking their stores so people can't buy stuff outside of their regions anymore
[3:41:58] ワフルデラ: like microtransactions in JP play store games
[3:42:18] itmeBOT:  We have an Epic Games Store Creator Tag now! Use 'itmejp' at checkout. More info:  https://itme.jp/epicfaq
[3:42:58] dFaroda: Why?
[3:42:59] ReginaldXIV: They always region locked stuff I thought
[3:43:05] Killian_Hart: probably server costs
[3:43:05] dFaroda: No.
[3:43:05] Neragsito: price disparity?
[3:43:07] ochsii: tax avasion
[3:43:08] ReginaldXIV: Unless you mean through VPNs
[3:43:11] afreak10: ddHuh
[3:43:16] Neragsito: things in LA are always cheaper
[3:43:21] PangieV: is that to try and combat account selling?
[3:43:29] BlueSapphyre: regional pricing?
[3:43:32] m3rcer: i tot stuff on google store was already region locked
[3:43:37] ochsii: that was the reason in germany
[3:43:38] Ageisfang: yea it's been that way forever
[3:43:39] Kyanilis: yeah isn't that the case already? I have a few other region google play store accounts already
[3:43:45] Zorlop: I thought the play store was always somewhat region locked already?
[3:43:59] Killian_Hart: doesn't google not pay any tax already
[3:44:00] BlueSapphyre: al capone was caught on tax evasion.
[3:44:09] BroqRox: with diablo inmoral Kappa
[3:44:09] ReginaldXIV: I have to go through TapTap or QooApp for games outside of the US
[3:44:19] ワフルデラ: dunno I just heard it, you can atm download games through VPN and turn it off and still pay with EUR or something to pay for JP games
[3:44:38] Kyanilis: qooapp is great
[3:44:39] ワフルデラ: so with this news that's impossible
[3:44:44] Ageisfang: a quick google search tells me that at least since 2015, and probably prior to that, google play has been region locked
[3:45:09] Kyanilis: oh maybe payment methods specifically weren't region locked? I don't think I've tried that
[3:45:15] Kyanilis: apps definitely are though
[3:46:01] afreak10: KEKLEO
[3:46:10] ritchie313: you popped 3 times i havent popped once
[3:46:24] Zorlop: @Kyanilis that must be it, I was near sure apps already where so it must be the microtransactions and in app purchases now
[3:46:30] ワフルデラ: apps were region locked for a long time but you could pay using foreign currency and payment methods
[3:46:38] tripstn: i want one so bad but i dont own a house nor can i afford one
[3:46:40] ワフルデラ: but reports are coming in of it now being unable to do so
[3:46:48] tripstn: so what im basically saying is please buy me a house and a tonal chat :)
[3:47:05] ワフルデラ: which sucks because FGO for example had a huge EN following in the Japanese version
[3:47:09] Moose2033: peepoArrive modCheck Jammies
[3:47:09] SouthernBiscuits: lol the mid was trying to pick jhin
[3:47:41] Killian_Hart: your adc c an't die if the enemy lane is dead
[3:47:50] moist_heinous: sutoKekW
[3:48:11] FormerlyUnknown: the cat one
[3:48:15] ワフルデラ: what sucks even more is games like Blue Archive are published under two different companies in JP and EN and they have different MTX, so now you're at the mercy of whoever is the publisher
[3:48:18] BroqRox: ddHuh
[3:48:21] Neragsito: that quinn is gonna be uploaded to pornhub as vore

[4:20:20] AinzN: ijpKEK
[4:20:39] TheChristopherG: Pog
[4:20:59] AinzN: Garen might be better for finishing off a Trundle
[4:21:13] BlueSapphyre: more salty.
[4:21:16] Nurama: more
[4:21:20] hollysephiroth: increse
[4:21:22] k0jak: it gets denser in general
[4:21:23] Shoaron: more since it get closer to the sand right?
[4:21:32] k0jak: since more pressure
[4:21:36] ochsii: well, google
[4:21:42] Johnny2Cs: Also has high pressure leading to greater concentration
[4:21:46] CastIronJake: My guess is by shore, due to evaporation
[4:21:48] Art_CM: Godking garen looks like buzz lightyear
[4:21:49] k0jak: it's all fish pee innit
[4:21:50] BlueSapphyre: there's even deadly salt rivers that run along the seabed.
[4:21:57] Johnny2Cs: thats why in the dead sea people float its because of the density
[4:22:11] CastIronJake: evaporation increasing concentration of salt within total water area?
[4:22:14] Nurama: Its why submarines in the arctic have issues reaching boyancy levels. So they have to account for temperature changes and salinity levels as they get deeper.
[4:22:22] AinzN: JP that's a question for those deep sea submarine people we've watched a few times
[4:22:35] Moose2033: salt content decreases slightly the deeper you go
[4:22:44] ochsii: its like playing league
[4:23:13] nuiben: @ochsii you made your contribution :)
[4:23:22] titanodin: oh a garen game
[4:23:24] dasmex: Aren't there like 'lakes' of highly dense salt water at those depths?
[4:23:31] ochsii: :D
[4:23:54] CastIronJake: Quick google search says it mostly depends upon the specific ocean

[4:58:48] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play on the channel! JP runs 3 minutes of ads every hour. These disable pre-rolls on the channel for 45 minutes as well as go to help supporting the channel, paying mods, and making sure our overlords are happy, too! Thanks for letting them run or by skipping them with Prime Gaming sub / normal sub to JP!
[4:58:51] Dudoes: @AinzN it looks pretty wild
