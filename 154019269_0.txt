[5:00:00] FishRoeSoup: well lucian sh1t on kass in lane really hard
[5:00:16] Sethd_: lucian can easliy split push both kass and renekton
[5:00:24] FishRoeSoup: yeah

[5:04:39] Sethd_: 30 cs vs 9 cs lul
[5:05:57] FishRoeSoup: cs Kreygasm
[5:06:27] FishRoeSoup: thresh Jebaited
[5:06:36] ghostofforsakenpast: if somehow they know where lee is on the map and gragas gets a flash bodyslam on thresh who has no sightstone yet and no flash even with lanegank it could result in a kill
[5:08:08] FishRoeSoup: not too bad, kass stay even in cs somehow
[5:08:25] Sethd_: kass tied cs against lucian
[5:08:47] scribbin_: jhin cs LUL
[5:10:05] ghostofforsakenpast: their win condition is to fight explosive fights midgame if that doesnt happen snake wins
[5:11:20] Sethd_: lucian could shit on kassadin in lane
[5:11:33] ghostofforsakenpast: ?
[5:11:41] ghostofforsakenpast: he has huge CS lead
[5:11:46] ghostofforsakenpast: had**
[5:11:54] ghostofforsakenpast: before ganks
[5:12:00] Sethd_: 6 cs isnt that huge
[5:12:06] ghostofforsakenpast: i said had
[5:12:18] ghostofforsakenpast: he had over 2 waves in early wich is gigantic
[5:13:05] ghostofforsakenpast: now kassadin can easily attack his mana pool with his sustain items and lucian goes oom as u can see
[5:13:14] darkblade83: why ?
[5:13:19] jungchaeyeon01: LUL
[5:13:22] scarzypher: lmao why is he even there
[5:13:28] roll1ng1: wtf wwas that position
[5:13:39] FishRoeSoup: LUL
[5:13:41] scarzypher: PogChamp that dodge
[5:13:52] FishRoeSoup: really nice prediction
[5:14:05] ghostofforsakenpast: i think gragas cdr boots vs caitlyn renekton lee sin is fucking troll
[5:14:21] scarzypher: same
[5:14:24] ghostofforsakenpast: LUL 0/5 kha'zix 2 games in this series and now g oing CDR boots LUL
[5:14:28] FishRoeSoup: probably want to be utility e flash bot
[5:14:41] ghostofforsakenpast: for what?
[5:14:47] ghostofforsakenpast: how can you engage on that team with flash body slam?
[5:15:06] ghostofforsakenpast: 30 seconds on flash doesnt comapare with ninja tabi vs caitlyn renek lee sin
[5:15:08] scarzypher: because he is not capable of ganking without flash e Kappa
[5:15:24] ghostofforsakenpast: but CDR boots maybe help you in 1 gank until lanephase ends
[5:15:28] FishRoeSoup: if he cant engage with e flash u may as well tell him to uninstall lol
[5:15:30] ghostofforsakenpast: BrokeBack
[5:15:51] ghostofforsakenpast: you dont pick gragas to flash E in teamfights
[5:15:54] Snipawolfe: E, flash, ult comes out too quickly to flash or net or outplay
[5:16:31] solcius: gragas jungle is shit
[5:16:42] ghostofforsakenpast: you flash E caitlyn, wich is the only option to flash E in a teamfight and get hook flay box and even kick or something and die like a dog
[5:16:55] ghostofforsakenpast: before throwing cask
[5:17:14] Snipawolfe: if he's slow enough not to have it buffered and get it out immediately, sure
[5:17:24] ghostofforsakenpast: ?
[5:17:32] ghostofforsakenpast: you will get CCed before throwing cask dude
[5:17:33] scarzypher: PogChamp
[5:17:41] ghostofforsakenpast: on top of that
[5:17:59] ghostofforsakenpast: bodyslam is easy to bodyblock
[5:18:11] ghostofforsakenpast: and caitlyns range is too big
[5:18:29] darkblade83: athena still save his flash
[5:19:17] scarzypher: what is sofm building ü§î
[5:19:28] Snipawolfe: not arguing either of those but if you think he could be hooked before getting his ult out you're insane or you think krystal can see the future lol
[5:19:36] ghostofforsakenpast: sofm is building knights vow
[5:19:51] scarzypher: he always builds weird stuff
[5:19:51] NVQQ: CDR items
[5:20:00] FishRoeSoup: 45% cdr lee song Kappa
[5:20:20] ghostofforsakenpast: dude stfu if gragas gets flas hbodyslam in teamfight on cait its your shit soloq game, bodyslam is easy as fuck to bodyblock and he will likely have no follow up and caitlyn sits at too big range
[5:20:23] emeraldadc_vayne: he build knight vow almost every game
[5:20:52] Snipawolfe: like I said, not arguing either of those. Lol. No shit it's easy to body block and she has long range. She actually has the longest range in the game LUL

[5:30:37] im_moyo: support items are all more gold efficient because they don't have stats that are as selfish
[5:30:49] Levigeddon: lul lol gamepedia says otherwise but it seems that you are right
[5:31:23] im_moyo: It's a support item that tanks build
[5:31:32] im_moyo: riot designed it for support
[5:32:05] im_moyo: what riot said
[5:32:10] im_moyo: and it's function
[5:32:53] Snipawolfe: if you're not near your ADC you lose 15% MS and 20 armor. It's not huge but it pushes the item under 100% gold efficiency, and you don't get the health/damage trade passive
[5:33:01] Levigeddon: ?????

[6:26:05] FlipperMeTimbers: ^
[6:26:17] Geddn: Caster is high or drunk ftnaGROG
[6:27:07] PreacherCasts: Every single game Zac leaks through bans, you give 100 different reasons why the game was won coincidentally with a Zac, and then the ridiculous winrate at the end of the season gets you every time DomLUL
[6:27:33] Geddn: Because some teams are Coky thinking they can beat zac
[6:27:59] Levigeddon: @PreacherCasts I think some teams want to learn how to counter zac so they dont have to ban him anymore and maybe can ban a comfort pick instead
[6:28:16] Geddn: ftnaWUT Pulse giving Frosk bad thoughts
[6:28:25] halloderbaer: but you dont learn in lpl games, you try out stuff in scrims
[6:28:32] PreacherCasts: @Levigeddon I totally agree. Regular split is best time and setting to learn. Not like you're gonna get it in scrims/solo queue
[6:28:41] ghostofforsakenpast: dafuq, zac is beatable, they made obvious mistakes
[6:28:50] FlipperMeTimbers: @preachercasts they didn't think clearlove played Zac. So it was basically a bluff to see if they get it
[6:28:55] ghostofforsakenpast: don't say they lose because of zac plz
[6:29:02] Geddn: Illaoi valentines day skin Kappa
[6:29:09] Levigeddon: @PreacherCasts I dont know whether you watch EU LCS but almost no team bans kennen against rekkles for that reason
[6:29:50] PreacherCasts: @FlipperMeTimbers Not gonna lie, Zac isn't the most mechanically challenging champ to play. I assume these teams have played with old Zac, so the new Q is really all you need to learn. Botch ult and it's not a big deal.
[6:29:53] Levigeddon: @PreacherCasts In addition, the average game time of a scrim is about 15 min so you dont have that much of a chance to test fighting against zac in late
[6:30:09] halloderbaer: Rito should combine lore and skin sales. for example make some Miss Fortune + Ahri lore and sell romantic skins at the same time Kappa
[6:30:29] ghostofforsakenpast: zac is not that great in late if the enemy plays properly
[6:30:37] Geddn: @PreacherCasts But if you do lose alot of games because you want to "scrim" instead of winning then your boned
[6:31:08] Levigeddon: @UdyrulPacalitDeVulpe Youre right. His biggest strength is his enormous gank potential
[6:31:11] PreacherCasts: @Geddn Hey man; I'm rationalising it, not agreeing with it
[6:31:32] ghostofforsakenpast: also Zac is not a very tanky champion compared to other champions
[6:31:39] ghostofforsakenpast: he has to collect blobs, thats his only tankyness
[6:31:43] Geddn: @PreacherCasts Yup just pointing the other side of the coin so to speak
[6:31:48] ghostofforsakenpast: in lategame he melts hard
[6:32:11] Levigeddon: @ANELE_WORLD_ONLY_HOPE ANELE
[6:32:17] FlipperMeTimbers: @preachercasts I know he's not mechanically challenging but would you rather a player knowing the ins and outs of a champion on your team or someone who has only basic knowledge of them?
[6:32:20] Geddn: @UdyrulPacalitDeVulpe guess thats why hes basically perma banned Kappa
[6:32:45] Levigeddon: @Geddn Well you dont need a good late if your ganks almost always result in kills
[6:33:07] halloderbaer: Ekko NotLikeThis
[6:33:15] ghostofforsakenpast: see?
[6:33:23] ghostofforsakenpast: zac got oneshooted almost
[6:33:25] FlipperMeTimbers: GG
[6:33:43] halloderbaer: no problem getting one-shotted when you have passive
[6:33:45] Geddn: @Levigeddon Yup also Zac only needs one good ult and pull them into his team and its gg
[6:34:34] Geddn: WE leaving Zac open 4Head
[6:34:41] Levigeddon: @Geddn Ye he isnt garbage in late but you can flash his ult if youre quick enough. His E can be interrupted i.e. by a thresh flair
[6:35:11] jarvitz: what were the scores of the other series and who casted them
[6:35:17] Geddn: @Levigeddon But despite of all that everyone knows his broken
[6:35:28] Êó•ÁãóÂ∞ëÂπ¥Âè≤Â§ßÂΩ™: 3502
[6:35:30] Levigeddon: @Geddn I dont want to argue that zac isnt strong in early or late or whatever but if your team plays properly he is not unbeatable
[6:35:59] Geddn: @Levigeddon I agree there but he isnt as nasty as Galio mid there are ways to counter it but its still very hard
[6:36:13] Geddn: @Levigeddon I meant he is as *
[6:36:18] Levigeddon: @Geddn Its hard to counter him but no impossible. He should still be banned by WE ^^
