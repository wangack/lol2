[1:41:25] hermeneutist: TES, also known as Throw E-Sports is a professional league of legends team known for throwing consistently at the highest level. Well known for losing despite having massive gold leads, they have inspired various teams around the world like G2 to do the same

[1:42:07] ziosevielspezel: @MarsmheIo  this is game 1
[1:42:11] rehs0m: @nereo50 lck is weakest it's ever been. Nobody cares about T1 except T1 fans
[1:42:11] droy_1_: @nereo50 RNG was by far better than T1 overall avec V5/TES could have won against T1 as well faker is outdated

[2:23:10] BroderBill: Tian looking at his paypal after the match and smiling
[2:23:13] bluesclues96: @khuuster808 yes, they do play too safe if they aint winning. it means they need to play more aggressive

[2:23:56] riddimgodkhuuster: yea i agree with all statements, im just biased bc LPL is so much more entertaining whether in a positive or negative direction each game LUL
[2:23:58] TheOreoCupcake: @Prosnail V5 have a different style tbh. TES rely on Knight's laning solely for mid pressure but Rookie has become better at moving around the map.
[2:24:16] Dulcista: guys, is this game live?
[2:24:23] ziosevielspezel: @TheOreoCupcake  with dragon buff every drake would be important it can change the pace of the game
