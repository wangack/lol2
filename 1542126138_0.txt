[1:12:01] CovererInGloom: @rockslide1 true, but with one difference; TCL > CBLOL > NA > LPL > EU > LCK
[1:12:07] makimakiboy: @omnialicent why not? I mean with all this online play and ping adjustment, that wouldnt be too strange
[1:12:08] AtticusT95: RA +9.5 kills is the good bet ???
[1:12:11] eugenINSTAocider: sylas>azir
[1:12:16] pyro_kertok: @west233_ Sadly, all those achievments are old. LPL is winning the recent LoL history. That is what matters right now. Not the past. The present
[1:12:18] zeffwizard: NO WAY LUCIAN COUNTER APHELIOS
[1:12:29] bolyvfr: If you think about this, players like Hoya and Rich are kinda meh in LCK, then they go to LPL and suddenly become decent players?
[1:12:29] Shyft4: M OMEGALUL NKEY KING do you mean fking Wukong =/

[1:12:51] dadedaweiybx: gumayusi no.1
[1:12:52] pyro_kertok: @zeffwizard Does and doesn't. Lucian SLAPS him early. If the Aphe gets to scale, he wins.

[1:13:30] splintso: @bolyvfr its a style thing i guess
[1:13:33] pyro_kertok: @zeffwizard Mainly, Lucian spikes 10000x harder on 1 item than Aphe. Aphe can do smth after 3 items.
[1:13:34] senseipogi: @bolyvfr so fucking true... but then there's nuguri KEKW
[1:13:40] zeffwizard: @kyodinha who is lucina? new champ?

[1:14:40] makimakiboy: @bolyvfr I think the constant, aggressive fighting style in LPL just provides more individual player improvement. When I compare the games of other leagues, it just looks like they avoid one-on-ones and fights in general, but for the necessary dragon/herald fights
[1:14:44] senseipogi: @splintso ehh, i still think nuguri pre-LPL was his prime
