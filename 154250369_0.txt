[4:47:05] songwilliam: 솔체원 퓨리 화이팅!!!!
[4:47:15] KappaFrankerZXD: but what he just did there was not smart at all
[4:47:34] Fr3nd0: like i said
[4:47:39] Fr3nd0: unlucky
[4:47:39] RustyTheCaster: eimy also was a bigger problem not going earlier and walking around the journey
[4:47:44] Killerajt17: What's up with uzi?
[4:48:08] KappaFrankerZXD: i mean it was bards job to initiate it and thus it was his responsibility to wait for gragas to be ready to enter it
[4:48:46] RustyTheCaster: pyl redeemed?
[4:48:54] Fr3nd0: gragas missclicked the journey that's why he pathed around it and it took him longer to get in imo
[4:49:05] Kaiseri: Cool had flash
[4:49:08] RustyTheCaster: hard to say he positioned poorly
[4:49:37] KappaFrankerZXD: i'll reserve full judgement until the game is over
[4:49:39] rofflepie: if cool wasnt greedy and ulted kog instead of trying to slowly kill him, they would have had time to get away from that tele
[4:50:18] Fr3nd0: happens when you click the entrance of the portal instead of the path, strange sometimes
[4:50:28] Kaiseri: he could have flash+ghost and he would have make it to bard portal
[4:50:32] Baloin: @RUSTYTheCASTER This is twitch chat. He needs to do something PogChamp in order for the hive mind to forgive him.
[4:51:01] RustyTheCaster: I will wait for the pog champer

[4:53:07] KappaFrankerZXD: they have done well to shut down lees early game
[4:53:34] eslrahc: Eimy?
[4:53:38] Fr3nd0: this is what happens when you play classic skin kalista instead of skt
[4:54:06] Kaiseri: like a monkey? 4Head
[4:54:22] eslrahc: i think omp dose not like SKT
[4:54:45] Fr3nd0: OMP

[4:56:37] Kaiseri: Imp is bae KappaPride
[4:57:18] Fr3nd0: an imp is supposed to be furious or fast?
[4:57:51] eslrahc: why could kalista appear in the games ? she is a useless champion
[4:58:11] Yoganshmire: She's like meta now

[4:59:04] bgijy1: \
[4:59:33] eslrahc: I mean, kalista was good ,not now
[4:59:38] Fr3nd0: i mean she only deals 90% of her ad as auto attack dmg Kappa super bad
[4:59:51] Yoganshmire: Did she get buffed recently or other champs get nerfed
[5:00:24] IceFoxMurde: If u compare Kalista to Draven, she is useless
[5:00:29] Fr3nd0: CmonRaz
[5:00:40] Symphoneers: Got some small buffs a while ago. Kind of a pocket/composition dependent pick imo.
[5:00:41] HystericsCasts: CmonRaz
[5:00:51] Fr3nd0: if you compare draven to pro play he is useless?
