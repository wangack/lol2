[0:26:10] mittudomen12345: @splintso G2 is locked by winning spring
[0:26:17] toguro17: not a LEC hater but super sad to see they gone 0-6 in finals  FeelsBadMan
[0:26:22] sg_yeebo: holy bangers
[0:26:23] lVGa0: G2 is a football team
[0:26:34] fred_birkhoff: dude from france, your name is against channel regulations lol... but yeah true

[0:27:14] fred_birkhoff: i tried tagging you, dude from france, but apparently ur name is against channel's moderation settings
[0:27:24] mittudomen12345: @splintso Remember the point system? G2 has 90 points because they won spring
[0:27:31] zizu7777: This are top eleven songs
[0:27:40] mittudomen12345: MAD for example has zero, so they must win
[0:27:46] aiandcola: EDG WILL WIN I BET MY HOUSE ON THEM
[0:27:48] lVGa0: G2 never won to iG right then TL beat iG in 2019 MSi so its proved that NA>EU no arguements
[0:27:49] fred_birkhoff: in mother LEC, dragon takes your soul FUNgineer
[0:27:57] TriHard_From_France: @fred_birkhoff is it ? 7 years on twitch first time some1 tells me that
[0:28:02] toguro17: @toguro17 world finals  FeelsBadMan
[0:28:10] fred_birkhoff: yeah... can't tag you
[0:28:14] donotbefail: The only way LEC team can pass their group stage is to win the first spot to worlds because any of the 4 LPL is a problem for them. meaning 1st spot can save them from meeting a problem with 1-2 LCK spots team.
[0:28:20] maxmilkian: Rip Joe Rogan
[0:28:20] mittudomen12345: @lVGa0 G2 won vs TL so NA < EU
[0:28:26] Jonas02696: dadad dadadadaaaaa
[0:28:41] splintso: cuz we cant tag u so dgaf
[0:28:41] adkillerpeople: @lVGa0 and G2 lost to SGB but EG not XDD
[0:28:46] maxmilkian: is XL good?
[0:28:48] bolyvfr: Personally I think 2019G2 is the best team west ever had.
[0:29:00] mittudomen12345: YEP
[0:29:02] fred_birkhoff: LEC is just as bad as LCS ... they just like to talk more... hearing who's better LEC or LCS is like hearing 2 toddlers fighting about whose dad would win in a fight ResidentSleeper
[0:29:26] shenosrs: @donotbefail good take, that’s what I thinking as well. Maybe 1-2 spots from lec can pass the group stage
[0:29:35] splintso: the gap between LEC and LCS is Caps
[0:29:43] TriHard_From_France: ok WE vs XL, WE would still beat em, matter of fact WE 0-11 would beat any LEC teams
[0:29:53] Creemi: @fred_birkhoff LEC is not looking that great but to say they are just as bad as LCS is delusional

[0:31:37] quernkor: is Ale back for this match?
[0:31:41] splintso: Caps went on a 1 month killing spree where G2 became great... he fell off G2 went back to middle of LCS team
[0:31:43] SkuLLzN: lec not that bad just can't win vs lck lol that's it
[0:31:43] TriHard_From_France: ok when LEC and LCS start doing a BO3 format then maybe you can take them seriously
[0:31:56] Zachmiller13: 2 bangers Pog
[0:32:04] mittudomen12345: LEC does have good games that are entertaining to watch but we arent near the 2019 level
[0:32:11] donotbefail: LCS need a miracle to even get 1 team out of worlds group stage man comon now... but they will script it because they NEED to let 1 LCS team to pass group stage to make it entertaining for the fans
[0:32:15] ejd031: Lng beat edg??

[0:34:49] maxmilkian: There should be a tournament that is just open invite to all teams and its just straight up play offs

[0:35:15] radwimmp: If Ale doesn't play i'm gonna riot
[0:35:18] donotbefail: @Worlds2022 He is actually right, if u take the lvl of all the teams right now and the competetive lvl of their representing league there is more probability to see 2 LPL teams in the finals.

[0:37:24] donotbefail: watch out predicting 2-0 V5, It's Photic&PPgod vs 369 today. If 369 is all about 9 today it might be flip to JDG side
[0:37:24] ViingadoR: LUL
[0:37:26] splintso: @ouyanwanlu well i guess RNG lose to TES in quarters

[0:45:32] immortelz: Jdg or V5 win
[0:45:40] SkuLLzN: @bolyvfr yeah, hard to bet in
[0:45:48] TriHard_From_France: @splintso nah its cause usually the opponent are too focused on chovy cs BatChest thats why ruler has it easy
[0:45:49] lVGa0: Faker will go to G2 after being defeated by LPL team caPs going back to Fnatic
[0:46:28] lem0nade02: jdg vs v5 why is this banger not on weekend
[0:46:30] mittudomen12345: @lVGa0 language barrier
[0:46:31] adkillerpeople: @lVGa0 fake news
[0:46:36] splintso: @splintso that is a factor def but Rookie and Xiaohu r similar
[0:46:39] achrafErr: catJAM
[0:46:39] TriHard_From_France: i dont think they have the money for faker
[0:46:40] sanestplayer: if faker dont win this year he needs to retire lol
[0:46:52] mittudomen12345: @lVGa0 why would Joe sell Faker to Carlos
[0:47:00] SkuLLzN: @lvga0 shaker rent free on teams kekw no more wins just money and muh title
[0:47:01] donotbefail: @splintso Can you tell me why u prefer Ruler? I'm watching LCK as well and LCK duo laners is not close to impresive as LPL ones. Watching Ruler dominate in LCK is nothing as dominate in LPL with all respect.
[0:47:13] Bento9: who makes this playlist
[0:47:15] lVGa0: @mittudomen12345 because he is washed up

[0:48:25] lVGa0: @mittudomen12345 if he retires he’ll going to G2 head coach
[0:48:34] SkuLLzN: @donotbefail lck tend to go easy on early lol go all in lvl 1 2 3 6 that's why it's hard to compare lck and lpl
[0:48:37] worlds2024: today is good day for LPL Pog
[0:48:42] maxmilkian: bo has 65% winrate tho

[0:49:20] oniichanaya: LNG AND EDG IN SUMMER LUL
[0:49:27] splintso: @donotbefail yeah i hear what u r saying but i think Ruler is creating his own advantage slightly more even with weak LCK, and doing 1k+ DPM in 25min games consistently is crazy
[0:49:29] maxmilkian: Toyz is in jail
[0:49:41] lVGa0: Ambition Broke T1
[0:49:42] JordanML1: awesome games today cant wait
[0:49:42] leishendj88888: When I saw EDG leading the rival's economy by 2k, I lay down and watched. When EDG was 10k, I just sat up
[0:49:46] toguro17: @UncleGtv than t1 / dk /g2 also match fix ? MaxLOL do u even have any brain cell before tying
[0:49:57] ohleho: wtf today's matches are so good
