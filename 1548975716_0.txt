[3:36:56] dammbj: @bosuadilac no,
[3:37:02] bluesclues96: @69N28E because zoom missed his ult
[3:37:11] twitchuserldz: LUL
[3:37:15] dammbj: lane is very hard, both team
[3:37:18] bluesclues96: @69N28E gragas ult isnt one of those abilities that can be dodged without a gap closer
[3:37:19] invertedcrayon: @69N28E @bluesclues96 yea thats sherlock
[3:37:21] namibi: because summit dodged
[3:37:28] lVGa0: I believe in H4cker supremacy ThankEgg
[3:37:31] Kexy: @69N28E no matter how well GP played. he shouldve been dead there. Zoom missed a huge aoe ult which is fkn stupid for a pro
[3:37:35] hermeneutist: is it really a miss when summit dodged it
[3:37:50] kittychicken69: LPL is NA on crack

[3:38:05] 0wnedbysanta: its a very big range to hit so i think he missed it personally
[3:38:07] Kexy: its a miss because gragas can easily E R combo
[3:38:09] ukraynali00: TCL?
[3:38:15] invertedcrayon: if Summit was Faker, they would be crying at the site of Faker outplaying the dodge LUL
[3:38:17] hermeneutist: zoom just greeded with the combo, not using R right after E
[3:38:18] bluesclues96: @hermeneutist no because gragas ult is undodgable without gap closer
[3:38:19] irlgigachad: @hermeneutist yeah but its pro level expectations, esp for someone who has a name for themselves like zoom
[3:38:21] ÎåÄÎßåÍ∞ú: ResidentSleeper
[3:38:28] hermeneutist: he did E Q aa R

[3:38:34] namibi: @MamunHS true

[3:39:27] hermeneutist: it's still a great dodge by summit, most other toplaners would've panicked and eaten the ult
