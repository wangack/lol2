[0:45:05] Nahxela: Vibe
[0:45:28] Kabior: Honest question: Whats the reason behind LPL having way less international viewers than LCK?
[0:45:58] discord_421: @Kabior LPL's primary region uses a different service, and cannot access twitch/youtube.
[0:45:58] Nahxela: they don't watch on twitch
[0:46:06] donotbefail: They all watch it in their own website and they have more views than LCK+LEC+LCS together
[0:46:12] MeIodee: @Kabior they're asleep
[0:46:21] dragostoma23: because lpl is broadcasted when most people have school/work @kabior
[0:46:23] Nahxela: Bedge
[0:46:43] TastyAMG: @Kabior its due to them not marketing as much to international fans and korea being dominant for so long but its catching up now
[0:46:56] MeantToBeGod: BLG gonna dominate v5
[0:47:01] TastyAMG: @donotbefail They said international viewers
[0:47:11] MeantToBeGod: 8)
[0:47:20] MeIodee: @TastyAMG +1
[0:47:33] eugenINSTAocider: 2012-2016 korea 2017-2022 china
[0:47:38] Kabior: Thanks for all the answers - thought something like that. Was just wondering since LPL is basically more fun to watch most of the time.
[0:47:45] eugenINSTAocider: nobody uses this channel
[0:48:03] TastyAMG: @Kabior LPL is way more fun to watch lol
