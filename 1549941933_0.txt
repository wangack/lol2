[0:45:05] Nahxela: Vibe
[0:45:28] Kabior: Honest question: Whats the reason behind LPL having way less international viewers than LCK?
[0:45:58] discord_421: @Kabior LPL's primary region uses a different service, and cannot access twitch/youtube.
[0:45:58] Nahxela: they don't watch on twitch
[0:46:06] donotbefail: They all watch it in their own website and they have more views than LCK+LEC+LCS together
[0:46:12] MeIodee: @Kabior they're asleep
[0:46:21] dragostoma23: because lpl is broadcasted when most people have school/work @kabior
[0:46:23] Nahxela: Bedge
[0:46:43] TastyAMG: @Kabior its due to them not marketing as much to international fans and korea being dominant for so long but its catching up now
[0:46:56] MeantToBeGod: BLG gonna dominate v5
[0:47:01] TastyAMG: @donotbefail They said international viewers
[0:47:11] MeantToBeGod: 8)
[0:47:20] MeIodee: @TastyAMG +1
[0:47:33] eugenINSTAocider: 2012-2016 korea 2017-2022 china
[0:47:38] Kabior: Thanks for all the answers - thought something like that. Was just wondering since LPL is basically more fun to watch most of the time.
[0:47:45] eugenINSTAocider: nobody uses this channel
[0:48:03] TastyAMG: @Kabior LPL is way more fun to watch lol
[0:48:11] eugenINSTAocider: wait until tencent closes riot games

[0:55:37] mrmwastaken: @nekolqaq nah they would be like 3rd-4th
[0:55:39] thatsdanny4u: @nekolqaq as an t1 fan myself i cant see that happening. maybe top 3 atleast. T1 needs to beat RNG atleast
[0:55:49] TastyAMG: @HuhAfro i have a bridge in new york to sell you

[0:56:43] discord_421: @HuhAfro Is it? Are you going to tell me that 369 Kanavi doesn't choke slam Doran Freenut? Or that Tian K9 Jklul don't dismantle their entire life?   v5 is literally just a better Geng, Cookie has always had better hands than chovy, and Photic PPgod are Ruler Lehends times two.

So vi may as well build something that's cheap to match her poor JG clear, and spikes early to take advantage of her power around the first few drakes, before her items become irrelevant, and the only thing that matters is her engage.

[2:41:57] ye1l: @istemezukcu Lucas had to play support for wink almost all his games... Xun had way better early games with Lucas too... literally just give Ahn+Lucas a some time, asking Lucas to look good with Wink is like asking UP to win worlds
[2:41:58] eugenINSTAocider: we dont question these things
[2:42:08] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l @istemezukcu Nah, Lucas wasn't a bad support. He had to play with Wink as an ADC. That's sad KEKW

[3:53:37] lVGa0: If G2 was in LPL they cant even go to finals or go to worlds
[3:53:40] bkkz: at least say kanavi
[3:53:56] fred_birkhoff: that's why they came to the LPL Kappa'
[3:54:07] discord_421: @fred_birkhoff And Clid is the worst player in LPL, and rich is the reason why V5 has lost series.
[3:54:08] bkkz: Kappa
[3:54:09] lcgbro123: bin is up and down
[3:54:14] proxx2187: Why would LPL downgrade too G2
[3:54:23] hermeneutist: kanavi has basically had his entire career in lpl at this point, he's like rookie doinb scout already
[3:54:24] lVGa0: Weezer
[3:54:25] goblinaush: @fred_birkhoff OMEGALUL
[3:54:41] jamespac123: @fred_birkhoff both trash KEKW
[3:54:44] justeattwigs: @fred_birkhoff you chose the worst examples of LCK players both of them absolutely sprint it
[3:54:44] tvc0101046: no karsa no win
[3:54:46] shenosrs: My man even if T1 and GenG were in LPL they wont qualify  to worlds lol there is only 4 spots
[3:54:59] lVGa0: V5 needs H4cker
[3:55:01] zandaress: v5 pog
[3:55:12] s9714153: LUL
[3:55:14] hermeneutist: imo the best kr import has actually been ucal, totally saved TT's split
[3:55:29] fred_birkhoff: ucal, yeah
[3:55:37] lVGa0: KMT
[3:55:38] niconiconiiiiiii123: no karsa right ?
[3:55:54] edwin123111: blg win
[3:55:54] hermeneutist: summit's arrival coincided with FPX's improvement, but imo that's just cos clid finally figured out how to communicate
[3:56:02] lcgbro123: no karsa
[3:56:05] Maix_: lpl gotta be the most entertaining region to watch rn holy
[3:56:13] bkkz: don't let the fact that fpx won some games to make you think clid is good
[3:56:18] Poenguino: 0 LULW
[3:56:19] hermeneutist: summit himself has had some cool mechanical plays, but nothing actually game winning

[3:56:34] jamespac123: 0 KEKW
[3:56:39] discord_421: @hermeneutist FPX's improvement came from the fact that they started playing against teams that weren't top five teams.
[3:56:44] KingStronGongKSG: riaaHeart riaaHeart
[3:56:49] xxxxxxxxxxxxxwwwww: Fuck XLB
[3:56:58] chamber0903: ez 2-0 for v5

[3:57:00] rngbinge: 0
[3:57:04] goblinaush: @shenosrs my man so omniscient can you tell me if tsm, bro or we won worlds 2022 POGGERS
[3:57:12] hermeneutist: @bkkz clid is still absolute trash, but he's been less trash since summit came... maybe he just needed a kr buddy
[3:57:12] goonmooryu: @shenosrs how u can know? If these two teams were in LPL maybe they would play more agressively?
