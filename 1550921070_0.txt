[4:07:11] Jaqxzy: jdg win?
[4:07:19] d9ajvcc: like atm
[4:07:24] TfcMyq: @d9ajvcc RNG 3-1 at worst for RNG
[4:07:29] dinkkky: song name if someone knows?
[4:07:31] CJholder99: @d9ajvcc rng
[4:07:35] BLG_worlds_2024: @d9ajvcc TES are probably the only team that beats RNG rn
[4:07:39] d9ajvcc: really?
[4:07:43] bolyvfr: RNG. If bo1 weibo will win
[4:07:54] jetlagging1: @RNG_Worlds_2022 369 doesn't int this split.  He has the highest kda among top laners
[4:08:03] TfcMyq: RNG's ability to play from behind is stronger than WBG's ability to step up and upset opponents
[4:08:14] d9ajvcc: and how about JDG vs TES?
[4:08:16] Graymane024: catJAM
[4:08:18] TfcMyq: kda isn't everything, what's his dmg/gold?

[4:08:33] boya_UFC: I go with Weibo
[4:08:41] lVGa0: RNG FoFo next year please so Xiaohu go back to Toplane
[4:08:42] TfcMyq: @bolyvfr bo1 is the most coinflip format ever, even as a wbg fan u cannot just say that with confidence
[4:08:44] slowvuong: KDA is everything
[4:08:45] kukka30: @d9ajvcc JDG won head to head but TES is till considered stronger
[4:08:48] bolyvfr: Hard to tell. Depends on Kanavi
[4:08:48] d9ajvcc: interesting, thanks @bolyvfr
[4:09:00] 1DavyJones_: TheShy is hereee
[4:09:07] BLGWorlds2024: The RNG team is very consistent. I hope they don't lose momentum during the Worlds.
[4:09:10] kukka30: @d9ajvcc it was very first game of TES and they are on 12 win streak after that first game
[4:09:13] longkazama: who did JDG lose against? V5 and EDG?
[4:09:22] TfcMyq: @lvga0 rng already have breathe who they've wanted since before 2021 started, why would xiaohu go back to top?
[4:09:27] kukka30: @longkazama FPX
[4:09:27] longkazama: oh it's V5 and FPX i think?
[4:09:28] BLGWorlds2024: FPX and RNG
[4:09:44] dropkickterra: FPX and RNG, they beat V5
[4:09:44] kukka30: @longkazama no JDG won against V5
[4:09:53] jetlagging1: @kukka30 they also only dropped 7 games all split
[4:09:55] longkazama: I see thanks
[4:10:05] lVGa0: @tfcmyq if he wants to Breathe is going to Top Esports after they win Worlds this Year
[4:10:20] kukka30: @jetlagging1 TES lookin real strong, happy for my boi GOAT tian
[4:10:25] d9ajvcc: @aaandrade1999 the year when Ruler took LCK PO over Faker as first seed, and RNG gets the Summoner's Cup, hun?
[4:10:26] HuhAfro: is wbg vs jdg just better draft wins?
[4:10:34] d9ajvcc: RNG got*
[4:10:39] whodafkisthis: FPX WON A GAME? NO WAY
[4:10:43] longkazama: LPL is actually nuts this year
[4:10:47] TfcMyq: funny how everyone's perception on TES did a full 180 whereas I always predicted they'd make top 10
[4:10:54] TfcMyq: top 4 I mean
[4:10:58] CJholder99: @huhafro pretty much, they're both coin flip teams
[4:11:04] Moobot: @ultranovel Like the music? You can find all the songs in our playlist here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw9aCc1gvCoDiVoVQLZxlHHbobp5yxMRX
[4:11:06] BLG_worlds_2024: @huhafro no, On is awful so I say it's like 70/30 JDG's favor without draft
[4:11:10] bluesclues96: @TfcMyq i was gonna say lol
[4:11:26] longkazama: @TfcMyq when did that happen? they were quite a top team in spring
[4:11:30] bolyvfr: V5 weak spot is exposed in LPL and maybe the weakest of top 6. V5 is huge overrated
[4:11:31] bluesclues96: THESHY GIGACHAD

[4:13:18] lVGa0: V5 would not make into worlds playoffs i hope V5 dont go to worlds
[4:13:27] TfcMyq: @longkazama they were experimenting with zoom and Xiaopeng and dropping a lot of games, tian was in bad form, TES looked in bad shape in general
[4:13:31] slowvuong: JDG won @chamber0903
[4:13:33] whodafkisthis: RNG > EVERY ELSE TEAM
