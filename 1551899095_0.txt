[1:44:54] dragonx_v: Hi yea
[1:45:12] slu876: i think viper is sitting on 2k
[1:45:14] hiwlp: Viper best ADC

[3:16:06] captainkrajick: Christina?
[3:16:07] battler_zz: @battler_zz Ofc he is, Aphelios is one of the most banned adc champions in LCK and. Specially against deokdam who uses it as a priority pick. You might disagree with me, but there's no way of objectively proving that deokdam isn't a top tier Aphelios player and thus the comparison.  At this point you're just enjoying to troll me.

[3:17:18] chubby_4: did view get at least 3 kills?
[3:17:21] TheOreoCupcake: @battler_zz You can have good stats if it's just 16 games. There are equivalently better Aphelios, not strictly based on stats alone.
[3:17:24] ZennShade: LPL so hard to know who will go
[3:17:34] untimelyten: @bbbbbbbb not wendy weirdchamp
[3:17:44] pallyden: @ziosevielspezel So was T1 in Spring. LCK is just a weak region so one good team is able to dominate, but LPL has many good teams
