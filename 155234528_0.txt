[1:13:24] PodoPlays: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[1:13:25] slin_: I don't understand why this hype match between two teams doesn't have thousands of viewers :/
[1:13:35] ChrisMisTrees: @RiotPulse DanDom
[1:13:41] CasterFroskurinn: Clever sarcasm.
[1:14:11] CasterFroskurinn: No one knows who Dan Gaming are - one of our goals this week is to drive extra content for them as they continue to rise because their storyline is so cool!
[1:14:34] CasterFroskurinn: Picking OMG vs DAN as a match of the week with EDG vs RNG in the same week is a big deal. And might be a great turning piont for the LPL.
[1:14:49] PodoPlays: hey froskurinn what changed on corki to rocket him into the meta
[1:15:04] CasterFroskurinn: They adjusted the percentage of magic damage he does
[1:15:10] slin_: I don't really think anyone cares about which match is the match of the week unfortunately but hey nice try!
[1:15:25] slin_: And a cool sign indeed
[1:15:49] Shuwarin: Yes
[1:16:06] PodoPlays: thanks!
[1:16:08] CasterFroskurinn: MotW always has higher KPIs than any other match.
[1:16:46] slin_: Dan!
[1:16:53] Shuwarin: Dan for sure
[1:17:18] slin_: @CasterFroskurinn I think that is because it tends to be the most hype matches
[1:17:30] slin_: Not because it was chosen as MotW
[1:17:40] PodoPlays: is the game currently being played or is it a pause
[1:17:47] slin_: good question
[1:17:53] CasterFroskurinn: @Slin_ That would be the definition of MotW. We pick the most hype matchup. And then make sure to drive content for that match
[1:17:55] Shuwarin: I think is being played
[1:18:33] slin_: So do you think that DAN vs OMG will have higher KPI than EDG vs RNG this week? Even with RR coming up?
[1:19:04] Nesbyy: Where is the drag queen?
[1:19:22] CasterFroskurinn: No, I'm saying we are driving content for it as the MotW and it's exciting that Dan vs OMG has the possibility of having higher level of game play with the recent performance of both squads.
[1:19:45] slin_: Ok cool =). I support the decision.
[1:19:51] CasterFroskurinn: And Yo @Nesbyy I wish I was classy enough to pull off being a drag queen, but I have a feeling you mean that in demeaning way - which I ask that you not! Thanks <3
[1:20:10] FishRoeSoup: jhin why walk back DansGame

[1:22:35] PodoPlays: agreed casters are making the most of the situation
[1:22:42] FishRoeSoup: @CasterFroskurinn what is happening lag happens so often recently DansGame
[1:23:22] Menshion_: 4Head
[1:23:28] CasterFroskurinn: Difficulty in connections from China. It's the feed coming out of China to us that has issues. We have multiple feeds and bounce around to find a stable solution at the highest quality.
[1:23:35] FlipperMeTimbers: LUL we skip forward 30 seconds
[1:23:38] Genialex69: guys where is uzi ?
[1:23:47] RustyTheCaster: I.. am so sorry guys.
[1:24:01] CasterFroskurinn: Uzi has been on injury and is now back in the house - he is stated to return after Rift RIvals.
[1:24:02] EmKzBlaaa: In the shop close to AK
[1:24:11] FishRoeSoup: has vpn been tried out by you guys? just wondering
[1:24:13] Menshion_: @CasterFroskurinn is broadcast not from china?
[1:24:42] CasterFroskurinn: I don't know the technical vocabulary well enough but the people we have on it are always working hard.
[1:25:01] FishRoeSoup: @RUSTYTheCASTER LAG BabyRage
[1:25:16] CasterFroskurinn: You can follow LPL news sources like tuwan and pentaq on tiwtter
[1:25:39] sleezyhoon: LPL - most slept on league
[1:25:43] RustyTheCaster: yeah, this is embarrassing, we're working on it
[1:25:47] RustyTheCaster: sorry
[1:25:55] CasterFroskurinn: Can you imagine casting a game with only 20 seconds of gameplay scene at various intervals? RAZ AND DOM CAN
[1:26:20] halloderbaer: caster in chat <3
[1:26:32] CasterFroskurinn: I am here to serve
[1:26:37] FishRoeSoup: yeah and those who cant are currently hiding in the chat Kappa
[1:27:07] PodoPlays: for real having casters in chat is so nice rather than the shit posting in NA XD
[1:27:08] sleezyhoon: @rustythecaster Maybe people don't realize that LPL teams like RNG WE and EDG can the best teams in the world
[1:27:13] uhhsonedduh: I bet faker worries, he seems like a worrier
[1:27:17] halloderbaer: they should do an 1vs1 in aram map and stream it here Kappa
[1:27:34] sleezyhoon: 383 viewers
[1:27:34] CasterFroskurinn: I believe Huni's quote about Faker was: he wins worlds and then the next day is in solo queue
[1:27:39] slin_: The chat not being pure cancer is a very nice thing about the LPL =)
[1:27:39] FishRoeSoup: yeah since its so lag can we see dom 1v1 raz in aram? Kappa
[1:27:49] sleezyhoon: LPL can beat LCK
[1:28:03] goblinguy01: Lpl fans are nice :D
[1:28:06] kiper2238: !score

[1:28:20] RustyTheCaster: we're trying to fix it guys I really apologise
[1:28:22] PodoPlays: rip
[1:28:42] goblinguy01: Where is Rift Rivals being hosted?
[1:28:53] CasterFroskurinn: As in broadcast or the actual stadium?
[1:28:54] PodoPlays: is zac the strongest champ in 7.12
[1:29:02] Bandillo64: rapgod
[1:29:02] zedismlol: I want IG to finally create a good Team, so Rookie can show how good he is again ... :(
[1:29:02] slin_: Who will win IG vs JDG and why?
[1:29:04] kiper2238: who wins 1st map?
[1:29:07] Kninet99: who is winning now?
[1:29:12] Stubsdich: what for technikal difficulties happened?
[1:29:14] Kninet99: dan losing?
[1:29:23] Bandillo64: @casterfroskurinn hi VoHiYo VoHiYo
[1:29:24] sleezyhoon: My question is this: why don't LPL space their names after their team name??
[1:29:26] goblinguy01: The location of the event, Sorry
[1:29:40] slin_: haha @Zinatraa good question
[1:29:42] FishRoeSoup: @Zinatraa space is not count as an character in chinese
[1:29:43] fortecillo: i can tell you whats happening
[1:29:43] dragonboy122: the penta shiet fiesta, no plays from lpl
[1:29:46] sleezyhoon: @rustythecaster how come other nations names are spaced except LPL
[1:30:00] fortecillo: dan's mid tower destroyed
[1:30:04] sleezyhoon: @fishroesoup if that's the case, how will this turn out at worlds?
[1:30:11] CasterFroskurinn: I believe iG will best JDG; their talent across every position is better but partially with Kabe in the current meta. I believe he was hidden by the tank meta of last split and now is exposed for his inability to play carries and help Doinb and JDG have a secondary carry. So if Doinb doesn't win, they lose.
[1:30:14] Kninet99: lpl have good casters
[1:30:14] fortecillo: 33k to 37k
[1:30:29] sleezyhoon: Worlds 2017 will be throughout China and how will they approach the no space names
[1:30:29] slin_: Thank you.
[1:30:45] Kninet99: yeah jd is not good
[1:31:07] dragonboy122: fuck THE PENTA
[1:31:18] CasterFroskurinn: My favorite champion is Jinx in qolo queue.
[1:31:26] Bandillo64: awwww yiss
[1:31:29] Dimsum93: where is the game?
[1:31:31] fortecillo: do you need a fcking web for the stream? cos even my lil bro would find it
[1:31:39] halloderbaer: Jinx is so fun
[1:31:40] FishRoeSoup: @Zinatraa good question, probably they will have local english tournament server and chinese client will see a box with that space character
[1:31:44] fortecillo: 4k rng winning
[1:31:49] Kninet99: i cant believe caster communicate with fans. this is good. we can never have this on lck
[1:32:00] CasterFroskurinn: @lkorah good twitters to follow are tuwan_esports and pentaq_esports
[1:32:14] goblinguy01: If you don't Papa
[1:32:16] Shuwarin: @CasterFroskurinn how good you think smlz is?
[1:32:42] fortecillo: casters just go to lpl dot qq and look for the stream there, cmon im tired of listening to chinese casters
[1:32:51] goblinguy01: Who was an Lpl caster, most Korean commentator don't talk to us :(
[1:33:15] FishRoeSoup: there r 20k viewer in lck ofc they cant talk to everyone
[1:33:15] Dimsum93: uhm can any1 tell me where the game is?
[1:33:15] dragonboy122: and why there were no plays like this in THE PENTA ?
[1:33:31] sleezyhoon: @fishroesoup LPL should practice that though tbh
[1:33:36] CasterFroskurinn: @yaaan depends what we're measuring for "good". I think mechanically he is incredibly sound and with strong individual decision making. I think he struggles with his communication across the team and doesn't excel in synergy. So while he may be individually better than someone like Zet, because Zet can build unreal synergy with Meiko and SMLZ cannot achieve that with Five, their 2v2 will probably even out or be dependent on matchup
[1:33:48] sleezyhoon: And I hate how China banned twitch google Facebook YouTube and big sites
[1:34:02] CasterFroskurinn: @ThatCanadianKidFTW I use a shaper by Mr. Smith and hairspray and never wash it os the oils help it build up naturally.
[1:34:07] Kninet99: Korean commentators never talk to fans in twitch. only on their own stream. i like what LPL casters doing.
[1:34:43] cantspeel: Hey everyone , our feeds from China are completely unreliable at the moment, we are working with tech engineers both here in Syd and in Shanghai to get a solution so that we can bring you todays matches. Thank you for your patience and all of us here apologize for this unfortunate circumstance
[1:35:20] fortecillo: cant you just stream the chinese stream?
[1:35:34] CasterFroskurinn: There is audio on the Chinese stream.
[1:35:40] Bandillo64: never wash it ? :o
[1:35:48] Samuka31: @CasterFroskurinn many people say that if a chinese team doesnt reach the finals the chinese fans just wont go to the final, leaving the stadium half empty. Do you think this is likely to happen?
[1:35:51] CasterFroskurinn: And it will be at a lower quality than the feeds we recieve from China
[1:36:16] fortecillo: hmmm understood :( gonna learn some chinese this morning then
[1:36:31] CasterFroskurinn: @Samuka31 No. Naturally there will be more people there for an LPL team, but there are so many LCK fans in China and SKT ascend popularity
[1:36:54] Samuka31: @CasterFroskurinn oh ok ty. Just another question: where are you from? I have always wondered :O
[1:37:00] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn I wish LPL was promoted more often than LCK
[1:37:09] CasterFroskurinn: @Samuka31 I am from Portland Oregon in the USA.
[1:37:19] Samuka31: Ok ty :)
[1:37:35] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn where are you casting at? Are you in China?
[1:37:36] halloderbaer: get your alu hat. pause was scripted. they wanted everyone to see the rarest event ever - MVP winning Kappa
[1:37:45] CasterFroskurinn: @Zinatraa We are always working on ways to promote and offer more types of coverage for the LPL with our resources
[1:37:56] CasterFroskurinn: @Zinatraa We cast from Sydney AUS
[1:38:17] originmorii: I was watching LCK, what did I miss? what issue are they having?
[1:38:26] Garrox: where is game?
[1:38:33] Bibu08: ?

[1:38:43] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn ohh
[1:38:49] Shuwarin: Hahaha
[1:38:50] Thekeyboardcatlol: @casterfroskurinn what do all the lpl casters main? seems like all of na are junglers (kobe, zirene, dash, jatt)
[1:38:53] CasterFroskurinn: The feeds we get from China are unstable. We apologize and are working on it.
[1:39:03] goblinguy01: It makes me sad to see ignorant fans who would rather watch Korean TL vs Envy over Royal Club
[1:39:09] unlock_the_warlock: 😎
[1:39:16] goblinguy01: Is their dislike for China that high?
[1:39:16] CasterFroskurinn: @Thekeyboardcatlol Rusty mains Support. I Main ADC. Dom is Mid. Raz is jungle. Pulse is Top.
[1:39:20] originmorii: @casterfroskurinn Oh dang RIP, no worries

[1:39:56] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn RNG seems solid for a 10 man roster and EDG's scout plays with a solid kda the last time I watched
[1:39:59] Thekeyboardcatlol: rusty
[1:40:01] Trudeus01: @CasterFroskurinn So with that full team, when are you guys gonna play some ranked flex, or have you already?
[1:40:05] Thekeyboardcatlol: woops
[1:40:14] jungchaeyeon01: CN Q LUL
[1:40:27] ogcals: whats the current score?
[1:40:31] callmedos: who won the games? or they havent started yet?
[1:40:32] CasterFroskurinn: @Zinatraa Scout is very talented, but EDG lack decisive mid game shotcalling to close their early game leads. They perform well in lane phase but are inconsistent out against elite teams.
[1:40:59] CasterFroskurinn: @huskieman1 Pulse and I have too high a flex queue ranking to play with everyone else. :(
[1:41:20] Bandillo64: :(
[1:41:31] Trudeus01: @CasterFroskurinn sneakyFeels that's unlucky for them, at least you guys have the higher ranks
[1:41:32] fappykui487: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:41:51] CasterFroskurinn: @huskieman1 Rusty is the highest rank - in masters I believe. Everyone else really sits around plat/diamond usually
[1:41:52] FishRoeSoup: haha this y4's kalista clip has been on every LPL montage LUL
[1:42:07] halloderbaer: kogmaw + lulu 4Head
[1:42:19] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn who would you believe is the best ad carry in China as of now
[1:42:21] jsssin: wtf this is top 1? kog was cheating with lulu
[1:42:29] Bandillo64: rusty the best caster confirmed Kappa
[1:42:32] sleezyhoon: Besides uzi
[1:42:53] jungchaeyeon01: PogChamp
[1:42:57] CasterFroskurinn: @Zinatraa Mystic comes to mind. Depends on what we're measuring. I think Mystic is the all around best ADC in the league currently. Naturally someone like Imp or Uzi have superior mechanics in those miracle situations.
[1:43:02] FishRoeSoup: how to make top 10 plays in LPL => pick kog press w and auto auto auto auto auto Kappa
[1:43:09] Trudeus01: @CasterFroskurinn Sooooo blame Rusty and call it a day
[1:43:18] thewolfinside88: When are the games ?
[1:43:24] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn mechanics ?
[1:43:28] CasterFroskurinn: @huskieman1 I love blaming Rusty. I die bottom and I'll blame him when he's not even in my game
[1:43:52] Bandillo64: :')
[1:43:56] CasterFroskurinn: @Zinatraa Uzi and Imp can do things wtih champions I don't realize are possible; they just get the most out of their picks.
[1:44:26] thewolfinside88: What time are the games at so I can sleep to them lol
[1:44:29] Chaotic_Old_Bore: i think aussie casters punch above their weight we have casters in all the best regions
[1:44:40] Trudeus01: @CasterFroskurinn Every group has that one person who gets blamed for everything. In mine it's the guy who doesn't like the game enough to play solo sneakyLUL he only plays when there's 3+ of us
[1:45:03] Chaotic_Old_Bore: lck lpl nalcs and opl
[1:45:05] CasterFroskurinn: @huskieman1 they are good sports about it!
[1:45:24] CasterFroskurinn: I think the LPL just trains beast casters. Every aussie caster started in the LPL.
[1:45:30] Trudeus01: @CasterFroskurinn Absolutely, and its all out of love anyway
[1:45:41] CasterFroskurinn: Because we have to deal with this kind of thing - always have to be ready to improv.
[1:45:44] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn hopefully I get to see their vayne sometime soon
[1:45:52] Thekeyboardcatlol: fish and spawn are great
[1:45:55] CakeJimmy: rip DAN
[1:45:56] 2丨2: ResidentSleeper
[1:46:00] PodoPlays: RNG just took game 1
[1:46:03] Thelemonish: it's amazing how much pulse has improved
[1:46:12] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn guess that explains why PapaSmithy is a good caster; he came from LPL
[1:46:24] uzi_in_2017: Did Uzi play in game 1?
[1:46:26] senga_kench: wait is there no English broadcast or something?
[1:46:26] Thelemonish: didnt atlus too?
[1:46:26] CasterFroskurinn: When you cast this many games and do these long of hours, we build up endurance.
[1:46:27] Thekeyboardcatlol: agreed dom and pulse have improved quite a bit
[1:46:44] CasterFroskurinn: Atlus, Papasmithy, Spawn, Fish, PastryTime
[1:46:47] CasterFroskurinn: all from the LPL
[1:46:48] Bandillo64: casting lpl for a day = endurance + 5
[1:46:55] Thelemonish: pastry is also great
[1:47:03] halloderbaer: Adcs with Lulu for their support shouldnt get in the top10 ResidentSleeper
[1:47:17] fortecillo: RNG easy win
[1:47:18] thewolfinside88: What time is the next game at or is there a pause ?
[1:47:24] SeknAnkeS: my enemy is a squirrel dasls i can't lose OpieOP
[1:47:27] Spawnthecaster: haha does it really?
[1:47:28] senga_kench: is there no English broadcast today??
[1:47:29] Thekeyboardcatlol: and they have to fight off all the roos on the way to the studio. builds sturdiness
[1:47:32] Spawnthecaster: casting LPL was easy
[1:47:35] halloderbaer: @thewolfinside88 pause
[1:47:42] halloderbaer: @SeknAnkeS Kappa
[1:47:49] uzi_in_2017: GOLD V LUL
[1:47:54] CasterFroskurinn: Spawn's a weirdo - don't listen to him
[1:48:00] PapaSmithy: We have a 1 hour break
[1:48:03] FishRoeSoup: btw guys game 1 is finished Kappa
[1:48:04] PapaSmithy: will send some viewers your way!
[1:48:08] SeknAnkeS: PogChamp R
[1:48:09] Bandillo64: spawn is the gg ez type of guy i see Kappa
[1:48:13] CasterFroskurinn: Casting the LPL is like sprinting up a 90 degree angle
[1:48:18] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy hey how's montecristo
[1:48:22] Bandillo64: yo papa VoHiYo
[1:48:28] Thelemonish: @papasmithy coming from lck myself lmao
[1:48:39] CasterFroskurinn: We're having technical difficulties with our feeds.
[1:48:41] Thelemonish: i dont know if papa and monte interact much anymore
[1:48:43] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy are you excited to see the telecom war from OGN
[1:48:48] Thelemonish: since monte is in the us iirc
[1:48:52] PapaSmithy: Monte's a very close personal friend, he's doing well
[1:49:08] Thelemonish: oh thats reassuring
[1:49:20] FishRoeSoup: @PapaSmithy is monte still casting for overwatch?
[1:49:23] grand_sizulate: the papa Kreygasm
[1:49:30] thewolfinside88: @dasls thanks and @casterfroskurinn your by far my favorite caster in any region cause you inspired my sister to learn league so she could start a career in sports media then to casting haven't seen her this happy in years
[1:49:30] SeknAnkeS: graggy PogCHamp
[1:49:32] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy do you see him casting LoL games not soon, but in a few years?
[1:49:40] halloderbaer: @PapaSmithy Im tilted since game2 from the telecom war
[1:49:44] PapaSmithy: no I do not
[1:50:01] CasterFroskurinn: @thewolfinside88 tell her that I wish her good fortune!
[1:50:41] Thelemonish: @casterfroskurinn cant skip over how much you have improved as well honestly
[1:50:41] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy what did oh think about the telecom war on Tuesday?
[1:50:46] Bandillo64: sick ryze
[1:50:57] CakeJimmy: I haven't watched all games, but DAN looked pretty strong this split while RNG looked ???? last week, do you guys think RNG can close it out?
[1:51:06] CasterFroskurinn: @Thelemonish it's been a long but steady road. And a lot of fun.
[1:51:12] thewolfinside88: @casterfroskurinn imma screen shot the comment for her to see she is always on twitter waiting for tweets that mention you or rusty she is going to be excited and happy you noticed lol
[1:51:13] GorgeousTorjus: @papasmithy I just wanna say I love you man, been watching a longtime.

[1:51:26] CasterFroskurinn: @thewolfinside88 <3
[1:51:31] sleezyhoon: I think I'm going to be a fan of LPL and LCK
[1:51:38] sleezyhoon: NA LCS THEY ALWAYS REPLAY EVERYTHING LUL
[1:51:45] fortecillo: this game RNG played to DAN like cat and mice
[1:51:58] Thelemonish: i dont mind the telecom war but im worried that kt are gonna tilt once again
[1:52:05] Thelemonish: i honestly predicted kt to win
[1:52:13] SeknAnkeS: was...was that a GA graggas?
[1:52:19] PapaSmithy: OGN Legion HeyGuys
[1:52:21] SeknAnkeS: WutFace

[1:53:58] PodoPlays: already did an AMA lol
[1:54:05] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy do you think SSG has a chance to win worlds this year? They seem to be looking strong?
[1:54:06] Papaxa6655: holy molly, that zzitai
[1:54:14] CasterFroskurinn: AMA round 2 with special guest @PapaSmithy
[1:54:14] Fromorg: DansGame
[1:54:16] SeknAnkeS: lul
[1:54:17] FishRoeSoup: EKKO PogChamp
[1:54:21] Thelemonish: @zinatraa this split samsung are looking pretty bad
[1:54:26] applingling: Fizz (puke)
[1:54:26] CasterFroskurinn: And I Think @spawnde is around
[1:54:31] eat_a__snickers: why did mickey leave
[1:54:32] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn do you think SSG can win worlds this year?
[1:54:33] Mollywhopqt: KonCha KonCha TehePelo
[1:54:33] Thelemonish: coming from a samsung fan
[1:54:33] MlSTERniceGuy: @CasterFroskurinn @PapaSmithy Do you think CN has a chance at rift rivals?
[1:54:35] PodoPlays: i think saying lpl has better players than lck is a stratch
[1:54:40] Lanolinlol: see fizz on screen = its a fizz outplay highlight
[1:54:42] PodoPlays: but they are competetive
[1:54:45] Lanolinlol: still pretty cute tho
[1:54:51] Thelemonish: both skt and kt are much better than samsung atm
[1:54:56] fiku: @CasterFroskurinn @PapaSmithy what will you guys buy me after I am the first import from NA to KR
[1:54:57] goblinguy01: Name 1 player outside of Famer better than Rookie?
[1:55:00] thewolfinside88: Well now I have to stay up cause AMA
[1:55:01] sleezyhoon: @thelemonish not really SSG is tied with SKT
[1:55:02] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn are you aware of the " HotPokket " emote spam that comes up when you cast internationally? how do you feel about it ;D
[1:55:03] Eldar_Warlock: WutFace
[1:55:05] goblinguy01: Faker*
[1:55:09] Thelemonish: i actually think samsung were amazing end of spring legit thought they would beat skt
[1:55:12] CasterFroskurinn: @MisterNoiZZguy MVP's not looking so hot last I checked in. And we're sending 3 really solid teams, but RNG are pretty boosted by last years performance, so that's a concern as they face KT. I'm excited for EDG vs Deft/Pawn
[1:55:15] MlSTERniceGuy: @Thelemonish Since skt lost in week 1 against SSG - meeh
[1:55:17] PapaSmithy: I think China can do respectably at Rift Rivals sure
[1:55:20] Thelemonish: standings dont matter, form does
[1:55:23] PapaSmithy: I think OMG is heavily favoured against MVP
[1:55:32] fiku: @PapaSmithy im ignorant, why did Mickey leave ROX
[1:55:32] Thelemonish: skt were coming from msi burnout
[1:55:35] CasterFroskurinn: @Gonillua Gotta love the culture of twitch chat. I don't mind it; pretty funny
[1:55:38] Eldar_Warlock: SriHead FeelsBadMan
[1:55:40] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy who would you choose SKT or SSG on their matchup
[1:55:51] PapaSmithy: The why hasnt been released but Mickey has left Rox and won't be playing in the 2nd round robin
[1:55:59] fiku: Ahh
[1:56:01] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn it's just like azael and the OMGScoots
[1:56:02] grand_sizulate: @CasterFroskurinn charmander squirtle or bulbasaur?
[1:56:09] Midl4nekingdom: it's really nice and funny
[1:56:13] PapaSmithy: I think SKT will beat Samsung
[1:56:15] CasterFroskurinn: @Opumashoslaba Charmander of course!
[1:56:17] Eldar_Warlock: LUL
[1:56:17] Nesbyy: Wait what? Mickey left rox?
[1:56:19] applingling: @CasterFroskurinn you should've responded with SaltyFrosk . Where is the LPL emote advertisement
[1:56:20] Thelemonish: papa knows
[1:56:25] PodoPlays: best gen of pokemon
[1:56:27] nameless_typhlosion: @PapaSmithy Cake or Pie?
[1:56:27] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy i hope so
[1:56:27] goblinguy01: I love Mickey, his days of Lspl are shown on Afreeca and Rox. He is solid player
[1:56:32] Bandillo64: charmander masterrace !!!
[1:56:33] CasterFroskurinn: @applingling I don't have the plugin to use Saltyfrosk makes me sad
[1:56:34] Thelemonish: im predicting skt 2-0 actually
[1:56:38] MlSTERniceGuy: @CasterFroskurinn Well thats fair to say!
[1:56:40] Midl4nekingdom: omg i need BTTV to see the frosk emote NOW
[1:56:42] Chaotic_Old_Bore: cohhWow
[1:56:43] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy they seem to look strong now with blank
[1:56:45] applingling: FeelsBadMan
[1:56:45] scottoflorida2014: SKT will destroy SSG
[1:56:47] Eldar_Warlock: TriHard
[1:56:55] Nesbyy: Which team does mickey joined
[1:56:58] CasterFroskurinn: @Kyle__twitch yes, RNG won game 1
[1:56:58] Thekeyboardcatlol: @papasmithy why is huni doing so poorly? :( besides getting camped every game. seems like teams dont camp untara as much
[1:57:02] sleezyhoon: @papasmithy what about peanuts recent performance
[1:57:03] Lanolinlol: mickey was fired because hes garbage
[1:57:08] eat_a__snickers: skt will never lose any important matches FailFish
[1:57:13] goblinguy01: Will finals just be Lpl vs Lck?
[1:57:14] fiku: @CasterFroskurinn why does LPL seem more aggressive and less calculated than KR
[1:57:27] Nesbyy: WHERE IS MICKEY PLAYING ATM
[1:57:27] Thelemonish: why are apples red?
[1:57:28] nameless_typhlosion: and @CasterFroskurinn what champion do you wish would come into meta?
[1:57:32] goblinguy01: I don't think LMS can ever beat LpL
[1:57:36] Eldar_Warlock: LUL
[1:57:37] Lanolinlol: mickey is playing in the trash can
[1:57:38] Thelemonish: its just how they play man
[1:57:40] CasterFroskurinn: @alrealre I think that has a lot to do with how LPL engineers arouand vision and monster objectives like Baron. The mentality is that they are better players so a 50/50 to the audience doesn't feel like a 50/50 to them and they'll take risky plays because they're better
[1:57:45] MlSTERniceGuy: @PapaSmithy Who would win in a bo3 M% ( at their peak) or SKT?
[1:57:53] MlSTERniceGuy: @PapaSmithy *M5
[1:57:53] Thekeyboardcatlol: in b4 mickey in nalcs
[1:57:57] CasterFroskurinn: @Fiku see the comment that i responded with to alrealre
[1:58:05] Lanolinlol: thats where all teh washed up koreans go isnt it? Keepo
[1:58:10] Thelemonish: current SKT? or peak SKT?
[1:58:15] CasterFroskurinn: @Paws403 I'm a huge fan of Jinx and I wish she wasn't so fringe currently.
[1:58:15] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn do you guys ever translate interviews with the players in LPL or not allowed?
[1:58:18] Eldar_Warlock: Syndra pressed R and didnt get a kill? WutFace
[1:58:24] thewolfinside88: @casterfroskurinn what do you think of the new champion and do you like his connections to zed Shen Aatrox etc
[1:58:26] fiku: @CasterFroskurinn @PapaSmithy will you guys follow me on twitter @BIGFiku
[1:58:30] Gamrison: @CasterFroskurinn AMEN
[1:58:31] fiku: KappaHD
[1:58:33] GMBZAVTRA: ebat lee
[1:58:38] fiku: aw it ran out..
[1:58:38] CasterFroskurinn: @Zinatraa we are actively working on trying ot get a translator but hiring and visas have been problematic
[1:58:45] fiku: lsxyzOk
[1:58:49] ehelloconga: remake ?
[1:58:53] Lanolinlol: DansGame
[1:58:58] ehelloconga: why pause ?
[1:58:58] nameless_typhlosion: @CasterFroskurinn yeah I feel ya with the jinx, seems too risky for most pro teams
[1:58:58] CasterFroskurinn: @thewolfinside88 I admit I haven't looked at him. I was told he was like Bard....but in the jungle? I don't know how to feel about that
[1:59:08] AoiiKitsune: Any update on the game? What's happening in game atm?
[1:59:10] MlSTERniceGuy: @CasterFroskurinn Did you guys had any influence in the rift rivals idea / system?
[1:59:11] Eldar_Warlock: LS sub DansGame
[1:59:14] pandamarkii: if crown shows up and cuvee keeps his streak up i think ssg can 2-1 or even 2-0 skt CoolCat
[1:59:18] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn keep doing you, your casting is amazing! i have one friend who doesn't pay much attention to the league esports scene but watches some LPL for your casting
[1:59:19] grand_sizulate: @CasterFroskurinn when is riot going to make a League hall of fame
[1:59:22] Thelemonish: wont happen
[1:59:29] CasterFroskurinn: @Paws403 She acts as a great matchup into Caitlyn but her itemization and vulnerability are too easy for professionals to shut down
[1:59:33] Thelemonish: samsung have looked shaky this split believe me
[1:59:39] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn LPL year is this year and they have to win it all
[1:59:42] CasterFroskurinn: @Gonillua thank you! That's incredibly kind! <3
[1:59:46] fiku: @CasterFroskurinn are these clips recent? I thought VG was relegated and Bengi was teamless
[1:59:46] Thelemonish: im a big samsung fan
[1:59:52] Eldar_Warlock: Arrow LUL
[1:59:52] CasterFroskurinn: @Opumashoslaba I want Riot to make Faker into a champion honestly.
[1:59:53] lazorbadger92: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:59:55] scottoflorida2014: SSG struggled yesterday to finish LZ
[1:59:59] GMBZAVTRA: вау ори
[2:00:04] Thelemonish: they arent like in spring even then they got 3-0d by a weak kt
[2:00:10] CakeJimmy: DAN - RNG in champ select
[2:00:11] CasterFroskurinn: @Fiku I believe we're playing everything and the kitchen sink - these are recent and old
[2:00:25] nameless_typhlosion: @CasterFroskurinn Her and trist are really the only adc answers to cait late game imo but what do I know LUL love your casting and analysis btw maxyyHeart
[2:00:27] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn I want faker to go LPL and get exposed by everyone lol
[2:00:31] CakeJimmy: Cait > Thresh + Gragas > Taliyah + Jarvan
[2:00:33] nameless_typhlosion: maxyyLove *
[2:00:36] pandamarkii: i dunno, skt's early has looked kind of weak and i think SSG can take adv of that
[2:00:43] sleezyhoon: @casterfroskurinn actually I want to see how faker plays in LPL
[2:00:52] Thelemonish: the only advantage ssg have is their history
[2:00:54] Midl4nekingdom: @PapaSmithy maybe LCK could use some highlights like this PogChamp ?
[2:00:55] Bandillo64: @paws403 kog and twitch can easily contest with late game cait
[2:00:57] goblinguy01: I don't think Faker can play in foreign team
[2:00:59] Thelemonish: they have been an skt kryptonite recently
[2:00:59] Lanolinlol: CasterFroskurinn Kreygasm
[2:01:03] MlSTERniceGuy: @Paws403 Twitch?
[2:01:05] thewolfinside88: @casterfroskurinn i hate it his e seems broken if you can't pull him out of his e out side map or in walls and his ikr making him untargetable is kinda broken
[2:01:06] CasterFroskurinn: @Zinatraa Faker isn't incredible because of his mechanics, a lot of players can match him there but his hubris in how he demands the game be played and how he constantly drives tempo in his choices
[2:01:13] halloderbaer: Leona got picked in a game Kreygasm
[2:01:14] REXmoreOP: faker as a champions sounds incredibly op, his passive would be all scripts ever
[2:01:18] Thelemonish: but looking at their form ssg will get massacred imo
[2:01:19] goblinguy01: Every SKT that has bad issues
[2:01:28] Thelemonish: like wont even be close
[2:01:54] nameless_typhlosion: twitch and kog are risky to run as they require a whole team comp to be run around them for the most part
[2:02:03] nameless_typhlosion: also twitch gets rocked in lane by cait
[2:02:04] goblinguy01: The only semi good SKT who left was Easyhoon
[2:02:05] pandamarkii: i dunno, the ssg bott lane does well against the SKT bott lane
[2:02:11] Thelemonish: twitch doesnt necessarily need a whole comp, though kog does
[2:02:13] pandamarkii: and top i think will at least go even if not adv towards cuvee
[2:02:24] CakeJimmy: j4 jungle?
[2:02:33] Thelemonish: you cant go lane by lane dude
[2:02:34] pandamarkii: i also think SSG plays better with a lead than KT does
[2:02:40] Bandillo64: @paws403 ye twitch is really good atm nr1 in soloq and top tier in pro meta
[2:02:40] CasterFroskurinn: @alrealre but it means they're that much better on the international stage becuase there is a smaller margin for errors on that stage
[2:02:40] Thelemonish: skt has kuch better macro atm
[2:02:52] pandamarkii: and i also think ssg can secure a gold lead against SKT early the way SKT have been playing
[2:02:53] Thelemonish: whatever we will see
[2:02:59] nameless_typhlosion: if he's top tier in pro meta why isn't he picked every game vs cait?
[2:02:59] grand_sizulate: SKT will never lose when it matters FailFish kkoma will never allow it
[2:03:02] jungchaeyeon01: when do skt vs ss play?
[2:03:03] Thelemonish: as i said im a big samsung fan so i hope you are right buddy
[2:03:08] CakeJimmy: DAN picked j4 jungle o.o
[2:03:13] sleezyhoon: SKT is good now but we'll see after their second match against ssg
[2:03:22] nameless_typhlosion: maxyyShrug I just don't think it's "good" into cait
[2:03:26] CasterFroskurinn: @alrealre great minds think alike!
[2:03:35] nameless_typhlosion: you can make it work though if you're creative enough
[2:03:37] mujarshad: rookie 4Head
[2:03:49] Gamrison: Makes me wonder what happened, since Jinx was picked somewhat often in Spring Season 5. Then poof.
[2:03:51] goblinguy01: Rookie PogChamp
[2:04:01] Bandillo64: @paws403 but twitch is pretty solid against cait
[2:04:04] pandamarkii: if SKT can fix their early game then it's going to definitely be rough for SSG but if they still look shaky i think SSG will have their opportunity but yeah we'll see
[2:04:05] grand_sizulate: rookie washed up FeelsBadMan
[2:04:06] sleezyhoon: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:04:14] Gamrison: Oh yeah the nerfs nevermind
[2:04:17] ledgarll: angarReally
[2:04:19] Fr3nd0: top 10 PulseChamp
[2:04:19] Thelemonish: jinx got nerfed didnt she? she didnt just magically disappear
[2:04:26] Thelemonish: the rocket got nerfed to oblivion
[2:04:27] Gamrison: ^
[2:04:31] REXmoreOP: what is this right now? A top 10 top 10 list?
[2:04:39] Thelemonish: as debuff wasnt it?
[2:04:45] Thelemonish: made her really clunky
[2:04:46] uhhsonedduh: meta top ten
[2:04:49] pandamarkii: what is going on in this stream lol, wasn't this just played
[2:04:56] pandamarkii: is it a break right now?
[2:04:59] MlSTERniceGuy: @REXmoreOP MakeLPLgreatagain KappaPride
[2:05:01] CasterFroskurinn: @ggGetJinxed as wave clear items get more powerful like shiv she - like sivir - loses a lot of her niche. Likewise she doesn't have many good matchups and her itemization isn't felxible. So while somone like Jhin can build 20 million different ways, she has one direction. And why would I play her when I could play Cait?
[2:05:01] Thelemonish: kinda
[2:05:07] halloderbaer: they are replaying highlights till the issues are solved
[2:05:17] pandamarkii: oh there's tech issues? rip
[2:05:21] Gamrison: SMDR nerf in 5.8 was the point blank range damage, then 5.10 they hit the attack speed on the Mini Gun scaling
[2:05:24] Thelemonish: yeah jinx' main problem is she gets outclassed by caitlyn
[2:05:33] envyubermagicman: CAN WE GET SOME LPL OR RIOT COPY PASTA PLEASE THANK YOU WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:05:35] CakeJimmy: how do you guys feel about Renek - J4 - Taliyah -Cait - Tahm vs Kled - Gragas - LB - Ashe - Thresh?
[2:05:38] Gamrison: @CasterFroskurinn Yeah pretty much this. Shame though I miss Baron steals with the ultimate
[2:05:39] Thelemonish: superior siege, superior laning, even superior traps
[2:05:43] CasterFroskurinn: Our feeds are currently unstable. We are incredibly sorry for the delays and are actively working to fix the issues. Thank you guys for your patience. AND I WILL DO ANYTHING TO STALL
[2:05:51] Fr3nd0: tech issues again?
[2:06:14] REXmoreOP: so the games are going and we just don't see it or are the games paused?

[2:06:34] FishRoeSoup: @CasterFroskurinn yes stall it out like game 2 of lz vs samsung yesterday 4Head
[2:06:36] halloderbaer: Jinx passive is not really useful when you are not getting rolling. not like caits
[2:06:42] REXmoreOP: play by play casting through chat :p
[2:06:47] RustyTheCaster: so we can't actually broadcast to you guys until its fixed

[2:08:09] CakeJimmy: @Zinatraa go DAN
[2:08:15] CasterFroskurinn: @Opumashoslaba I really like Deficio and Quickshot
[2:08:16] michaelsund: @FishRoeSoup MingLee
[2:08:19] MlSTERniceGuy: @CasterFroskurinn Days ago couldnt find the reason why Uzi isnt playing even after some research therefore i am very happy to hear that!
[2:08:21] AmazingSalvia: quickshot and deficio Kreygasm
[2:08:26] Espen115: good taste SeemsGood
[2:08:26] nameless_typhlosion: LCK casters do their best but it's still not the same without them
[2:08:29] Thelemonish: deficio quickshot best duo KappaPride
[2:08:31] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn is vladimir's blood black in lpl for some cultural reason ?
[2:08:31] sleezyhoon: @ijimmyn that's DAN team comp?
[2:08:32] grand_sizulate: SeemsGood
[2:08:39] RustyTheCaster: yes @gonillua
[2:08:43] CasterFroskurinn: @Gonillua blood cannot be shown - so they make it black
[2:08:45] MlSTERniceGuy: @CasterFroskurinn Thx for letting me know !
[2:08:46] CakeJimmy: @Zinatraa yes, the other comp is RNG comp
[2:08:54] goblinguy01: On Chinese stream. RNG 1-0 Dan Gaming
[2:09:03] Thelemonish: i think all lck casters are amazing but i miss the 2 color caster times
[2:09:14] AtlantianWraith: >_<
[2:09:15] Midl4nekingdom: like it cannot be shown whatsoever on screen in china? @RUSTYTheCASTER @CasterFroskurinn thank you
[2:09:19] Thelemonish: its all papa now i want some variety even tho i love papa
[2:09:36] CasterFroskurinn: @Gonillua in video games. There's also skeleton faces so karthus has a different picture in the CN client
[2:09:38] michaelsund: Crumbzz BrokeBack
[2:09:38] sleezyhoon: @ijimmyn DAN has a chance to close the game out at 35 mins the latest or RNG wins by tank composition
[2:09:45] Thelemonish: sucks that papa left chat
[2:09:49] Espen115: Atlus is so good though
[2:09:56] Thelemonish: i wanted to have his thoughts on having another color with him
[2:10:00] PulseIRL: @CasterFroskurinn So does Hecarim PogChamp
[2:10:01] goblinguy01: Royal Club is more experienced team, they can turtle
[2:10:04] Thelemonish: atlus is amazing but he isnt color
[2:10:17] CakeJimmy: @Zinatraa not the biggest fan of LB lategame though, maybe I see it wrong
[2:10:20] Espen115: I know I'm saying it's the tradeoff we get two good pbp
[2:10:20] RustyTheCaster: atlus is an excitable yelly man not a colour
[2:10:21] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn thanks for the response i appreciate it; is it a cultural or religious reason if u'd happen to know

[2:11:27] Thelemonish: i know the word 4 is incredibly superstitious
[2:11:28] GLPhoenix: Similar to the karthus/vlad thing, in HotS, Stiches has open stomach, but in the Chinese client it is covered by a tarp of sorts
[2:11:32] PulseIRL: @1MrFahrenheit Kreygasm
[2:11:34] CasterFroskurinn: No he has four and he's considered cool for his association with death

[2:13:11] CakeJimmy: nothing happened in those 8 min, was watching
[2:13:26] koreancrispy: mlxg looks like hes from harry potter
[2:13:30] CasterFroskurinn: Sounds like Raz and Dom were also watching by how they're setting this up
[2:13:46] cantspeel: indeed they were
[2:14:07] CasterFroskurinn: Goodwork team! And thank you to everyone in twitch chat - you da real MVPs

[2:14:45] Thelemonish: is it fixed now?
[2:14:47] Midl4nekingdom: @CasterFroskurinn incredible stalling somehow 20 minutes passed by so fast BibleThump
[2:14:59] Thelemonish: like behind 3 patches or so
[2:15:06] GrimWillOnTwitchTV: @CasterFroskurinn Is Double Dorans ring still worthwhile then, even with the unique passive?
[2:15:09] CasterFroskurinn: The patch is distributed differently than other regions because the client is tencent and not riot. It's much better than it was but still usually a week behind
[2:15:18] PulseIRL: @Danielchoder MLXG starred in the Chinese equivalent of Broadway in a theater production of Harry Potter
[2:15:29] koreancrispy: lmao
[2:15:29] CasterFroskurinn: @GrimWillOnTwitchTV it's not nearly as efficient as it used to be but @RUSTYTheCASTER is a better guy to break it down
[2:15:33] Thelemonish: i think most people go a ring plus a dark seal now

[3:25:58] zedismlol: The caster is autistic JDG only used 2 summs less than IG on the toplane fight

[3:31:33] zedismlol: JDG is stronger currently than IG, difficult to contest for them
[3:31:48] kuwagami: if they don't contest or prevent they lose
[3:31:57] MrBaneBlade: JDG aren't stronger, they just scale it better
[3:32:13] MrBaneBlade: IGs comp is in a peak atm
[3:32:30] zedismlol: only rooklie playing it right, going into the drake to prevent JDG killing it
[3:32:50] zedismlol: IG has a IE finished adc, while JDG have a BotrK adc
[3:32:58] zedismlol: only winning possibility for IG is rookie
[3:33:05] zedismlol: who played it right, so they won
[3:33:15] MrBaneBlade: uh
[3:33:18] zedismlol: if rookie got fcked up this would have been easily wown by JDG
[3:33:24] kuwagami: technically, Cait IE first item isn't wrong
[3:33:32] zedismlol: its not wrong
[3:33:34] MrBaneBlade: IE Tabi > BotRK/Zerkers
[3:33:34] kuwagami: but the build up is weak at this point into the game
[3:33:37] zedismlol: but its a waqy weaker powerspike
[3:33:44] zedismlol: yeah
[3:34:05] FishRoeSoup: reksai ??? CoolStoryBob
[3:34:18] MrBaneBlade: but the more important thing is that Kha 1 item is infinitely better than Rek'Sai
[3:34:36] MrBaneBlade: And since Shen has greedy defensive items, vs Gragas' scaling tank items
[3:34:43] MrBaneBlade: IG had the perfect recipe to take the fight
[3:34:46] zedismlol: that dopesnt matter cause Kha shouldnt be able to do shit against JDGs disengage
[3:34:47] kuwagami: Gragas Vow first item? WutFace
[3:35:04] MrBaneBlade: what disengage? Gragas ult?
[3:35:06] FishRoeSoup: wow really vow first.. CoolStoryBob
[3:35:12] zedismlol: JDG got Gragas/Kali ult, Kha should be useless in fights
[3:35:24] zedismlol: if he goes in he is gonna be perma cced
[3:35:24] MrBaneBlade: not when you are contesting drake
[3:35:34] MrBaneBlade: if you perma cc Kha you die to Shen
[3:35:37] zedismlol: Gragas ult him awway, what does he do?
[3:35:50] zedismlol: shen cant hit kalista
[3:35:52] MrBaneBlade: Kha will never get hit by a gragas ult in river
[3:36:02] zedismlol: then get kalista ulted
[3:36:13] zedismlol: or reksai knock uped
[3:36:37] FishRoeSoup: doesnt even need knockup, stand together and kha is fked, ig doesnt have good aoe to respond
[3:36:50] MrBaneBlade: so all the while Cait/Syndra consistent damage is burning your front line, and Cait/Syndra kills Gragas faster than JDG can kill Kha/Shen
[3:36:54] zedismlol: Ig has good AOE Syndra at this point is tons of AOE
[3:37:01] MrBaneBlade: West is literally untouched
[3:37:20] zedismlol: yeah but wwest doesnt do equal damage as kalista
[3:37:21] mujarshad: megan 4Head
[3:37:21] FishRoeSoup: syndra aoe? CoolStoryBob
[3:37:35] MrBaneBlade: Yes you're right, at the 1 item powerspike he does more
[3:37:46] zedismlol: and dont forget the 2 infernal advantage JDG had, that is 200 damage per person level 11
[3:37:49] Itakura_StuGIII: JDG LUL
[3:37:55] kuwagami: it doesn't help that gragas's first item is useless in this situation
[3:38:02] MrBaneBlade: Infernal is useless of Kalista
[3:38:02] Fr3nd0: SaltyFrosk
[3:38:12] MrBaneBlade: Infernal is also useless on Gragas
[3:38:23] MrBaneBlade: Infernal is also fairly useless on 1 item Vlad
[3:38:24] zedismlol: its about 200 damage per person on level 11
[3:38:38] MrBaneBlade: it's literally 0 damage on Gragas
[3:38:38] FishRoeSoup: but only vlad stacks ap/ad though
[3:38:43] zedismlol: its 8 damage more on your E per stack
[3:39:07] mujarshad: wow 3 infernals then 2 mts
[3:39:24] MrBaneBlade: It's 0 damage on Gragas, it's potentially maybe 15 on Kalista, and maybe 50 on Vlad if he has AP runes
[3:39:30] SnowtrooperX: perfect recipe for a fiesta
[3:39:37] MrBaneBlade: sorry it's 16% of 10 for Gragas
[3:39:42] FishRoeSoup: actually that 1 infernal on ig is probably stronger than 2 infernal on jdg
[3:39:42] Fr3nd0: infernal is bad on our champs we should just give it up to the enemy LUL
[3:39:44] zedismlol: how much % is infernal? 16? with 120 ad thats 20 ad more, thats 2 long swords, thats 720 gold, thats 3.5k gold advantage this early on
[3:40:07] zedismlol: for that fight it was huge for JDG
[3:40:12] kuwagami: the only use JDG will get out of the infernals they got is with elder buff
[3:40:15] zedismlol: early infernal is udnerrated as fuck
[3:40:24] zedismlol: thats complete bullshit lmao
[3:40:49] zedismlol: even with base AD without buying any more damage stats 2 Infernals are about 500 gold for you
[3:41:00] MrBaneBlade: In a comp
[3:41:04] zedismlol: its better on other comps
[3:41:07] MrBaneBlade: that is automatically about 3.5k behind
[3:41:11] zedismlol: but saying its useless
[3:41:12] MrBaneBlade: so in reality
[3:41:21] zedismlol: is retarded
[3:41:24] mujarshad: kuwa what kind of opinion is that EleGiggle
[3:41:27] MrBaneBlade: it's not useless, it's for the late game, saying it's for elder isn't wrong
[3:41:39] halloderbaer: twitch chat discussion on its finest
[3:41:47] Fr3nd0: indeed
[3:41:51] zedismlol: its 3.5k gold 20 minutes into the game too, thats fkcing huge???
[3:41:55] MrBaneBlade: Duke is literally 1v5ing this game lmao
[3:42:10] FishRoeSoup: how many times reksai got caught this game with flash available CoolStoryBob
[3:42:15] MrBaneBlade: the 3.5k you MAYBE get from Infernal makes them EVEN when you think about composition
[3:42:32] Itakura_StuGIII: PogChamp
[3:42:45] zedismlol: not at that point when Kali is 10 times stronger than cait lmao
[3:42:53] Fr3nd0: with this many experts in twitch chat how come we dont have 10million different casters :/
[3:43:14] adrian_vale22: 600 viewers?
[3:43:17] halloderbaer: lol Cait still died to Gragas
[3:43:26] FishRoeSoup: damn cait passive stacks from bush did a lot in that fight
[3:43:34] zedismlol: cause i dont wanna have an underpaid job without being able to get any further ducation?
[3:44:12] MrBaneBlade: No Cait v Kali 1 item each is very split, but the tabi for Cait with heals, means Cait will out DPS Kali
[3:44:20] FishRoeSoup: @Fr3nd0 EleGiggle
[3:44:20] MrBaneBlade: Especially with Kali beeing forced to keep stacks on drake
[3:44:23] Fr3nd0: where is RAZ BabyRage

[3:55:26] FishRoeSoup: @SeknAnkeS its proven, but just really difficult and not worth to risk to cleanse/qss it though
[3:55:29] Fr3nd0: happens not often tbh
