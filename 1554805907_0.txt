[1:01:12] Fyrixia: @Fyrixia It's rumoured in China to be contract related Karsa only has a 1 year deal with v5 and Karsa hasn't wanted to resign yet so V5 decided to bench him

[1:12:50] 熱狗王小馬: XLB MingLee MingLee
[1:13:06] captainkrajick: @monkeypaws00 Karsa doesn't want to renew contract with V5, so V5 are threatening to not let him play

[1:13:32] captainkrajick: @TheOreoCupcake I want RNG to win so we can have the Golden Road Pog
[1:13:43] captainkrajick: @TheOreoCupcake and Xiaohu can be the GOAT and not Faker BASED
[1:14:06] Fyrixia: @TheOreoCupcake Very clean which is a very strange thing to say about TES normally
[1:14:11] TheOreoCupcake: @TheOreoCupcake @captainkrajick RNG's kryptonite is V5. Just avoid them and Tian will int in playoffs Prayge KEKW
[1:14:15] ahanem: @monkeypaws00 i mean if they know Karsa wont be there next year might as well see what they got in XLB right?
[1:14:36] TheOreoCupcake: @TheOreoCupcake @Fyrixia I usually don't call TES clean but their last game, it seems the players actually started to use the mic given to them KEKW
[1:14:43] captainkrajick: @monkeypaws00 @ahanem Yeah that's the reasoning for V5 playing XLB
[1:15:00] captainkrajick: @TheOreoCupcake @TheOreoCupcake Also the All Chat begging for the Penta KEKW

[1:15:49] AuxCasts: @ahanem not really when they still have playoffs/ potentially worlds ahead. Focus should be fielding best roster to win

[1:17:17] ahanem: @AuxCasts while i mostly agree with that (in major sports this is the definition of a tanking strategy), Karsa might have motivational issues as well and that is not easy to tell without having inside info
[1:17:18] therookie548: TSM KARSA
[1:17:22] TheOreoCupcake: @jun_429 @jun_429 Nah we here everyday. XLB easily is more proactive and ganks more than Karsa. Karsa is just smarter at the game. This ain't up for argument KEKW

[1:18:44] 麻糬是隻狗: @jun_429 u mean mindless aggression? ganking bot for 3 times in 1min and causing a 3 man dive on rich?

[4:05:09] 泫雅老公: @OGBryan0202 V5 Coach Nofe said he will not play for V5 in this season
[4:05:31] Pluzervii: hey, EDG is still pretty good
[4:05:32] OGBryan0202: @OGBryan0202 Sadge, i rate Karsa > XLB
[4:05:48] badjuju518: n
[4:05:53] badjuju518: nm
[4:05:54] OGBryan0202: @Pluzervii Pretty good but not good enough
[4:05:58] 水原千鶴的老公: V5 Rookie next season , V5 Karsa peepoHey
[4:06:01] irlgigachad: @OGBryan0202 was it ever confirmed, keep hearing contract stuff
[4:06:05] rinbunbun: TES JDG RNG V5
[4:06:13] Pluzervii: viper man
[4:06:16] lampshade_cg: who won?
[4:06:16] itsokbroIol18: AYAYA

[4:06:34] skuukzky7: who win ?
[4:06:37] sheiboyi: edg wbg>>>v5
[4:06:39] OGBryan0202: @Pluzervii Yea, he's good but other roles kinda iffy
[4:07:07] mobiano: how come they lost
[4:07:08] monkaspepe: AYAYAYAYA
[4:07:19] lorddino2: who won?
[4:07:25] 松松德腸子: Korea dad carry
[4:07:29] OGBryan0202: If only V5 plays more consistently, defo worlds material
[4:07:29] mobiano: v5
[4:07:38] Nickel1704: @lampshade_cg V5
[4:07:48] Len_xyz: @OGBryan0202 is it contract stuff? or performance?
[4:08:02] Raymondan: I think it will be V5 TES RNG and maybe one out of JDG\EDG\WBG (lowest chance here lol)
[4:08:02] Pluzervii: @Pluzervii we'll see in the playoffs
[4:08:10] Raymondan: LPL has 4 spots right?
[4:08:12] 泫雅老公: @OGBryan0202 No one knows.
[4:08:15] 水原千鶴的老公: as an old iG fan , Rookie or TheShy go to worlds Prayge
[4:08:40] 水原千鶴的老公: @Raymondan YEP
[4:08:56] sightstoneward: monkaS
[4:08:59] OGBryan0202: @水原千鶴的老公 I wanna watch Theshy show in worlds as well, but the other roles performs very inconsistently
[4:09:07] leo5789: knight vs Rookie
[4:09:12] 22kush: TES JDG are the best teams
[4:09:23] 泫雅老公: I personally think XLB's upper limit cannot even reach Karsa's lower limit so I don't believe it's because of performance
[4:09:29] C9_Kindboi: @水原千鶴的老公 GenG gonna win this year
[4:09:33] 22kush: EDG is good but not clutch and RNG is clutch but not good
[4:09:33] lVGa0: PSG and TES best teams
[4:09:37] 浣熊俠: veiCry karsa
[4:09:39] OGBryan0202: Can't write off V5 yet though, rookie is really good
[4:09:46] badjuju518: m
[4:10:09] rinbunbun: GenG sure they do LUL
[4:10:12] 水原千鶴的老公: WENDY AYAYA BAIBAI TY
[4:10:17] 22kush: Yeah can’t write them off for sure
[4:10:18] OGBryan0202: @泫雅老公 So true, XLB is very inconsistent as well
[4:10:27] painlimit1: LUL
[4:10:29] Raymondan: Definitely don’t know out of the top 4 (RNG TES V5 JDG) I think V5 and JDG are the two that I’m not really certain. TES and RNG did well spring. RNG TES got enough points to qualify
[4:10:35] Pluzervii: i believe in Edg man they're the same cast as the world champions don't forget that
[4:10:35] pikacho000: imagine the shy plus rookie
[4:10:55] badjuju518: mm mmmmm m m
[4:11:01] 22kush: RNG gets pretty lucky
[4:11:07] OGBryan0202: Competition for LPL is real tight
[4:11:11] painlimit1: a team with jkl theshy and rookie sounds pgood
[4:11:11] 水原千鶴的老公: TES RNG JDG EDG/WBG/V5 EZ
[4:11:12] 22kush: EDG v RNG was a good example. RNG should not have won thata
[4:11:14] leo5789: DuDu!!
[4:11:21] leo5789: Dushy!
[4:11:26] BLG_worlds_2024: @Raymondan YEP TES and RNG top 2 for sure. between JDG, V5, and EDG, i have no idea
[4:11:26] skillderxx: They play like that verse TES they’ll get rolled in 20 mins
[4:11:28] oce_mir4i: LCK LULW

[4:12:49] Raymondan: Nah RNG is a really good team. Just sometimes picks horribly lol. JDG would be the one I’m concerned for me. They have been defined as the team whom(smashes their heads together recklessly brutally and sees if it works) from a caster lol
[4:12:57] badjuju518: ?

The International Wildcard Invitational was replaced by the Play-in Stage. The best Wildcard region receives a direct spot in the World Championship's Group Stage for that year for their Summer Split champion.

[4:53:45] hal90000: @BOOM_KO Pantheon R is so garbage. Is worthless in TF and even as ganking tool because the opponent need to be so out of position. Literally worthless spell
[4:53:52] lfishl: JDG 18-0
[4:53:53] jetlagging1: Schedule trolled AL with the biggest false hope
[4:53:57] lVGa0: iboy>doggo>betty

[4:56:05] 03c63ef3: 333
[4:56:07] maeilmilk318: so
[4:56:07] hal90000: @BOOM_KO Even on Ganks or Flanks the enemy would need to be so distracted that they would notice the massive mark on the floor that feels like if takes 15 seconds to arrive
