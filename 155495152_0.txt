[1:54:51] Bedroevelse: I practice 20 hours a day and I'm almost NA levelSilver 2 btw haHAA
[1:54:52] rofflepie: UOL can beat EU teams cause they are all passive as hell and doesnt make any moves, if they play against any real region they'll get stomped, cause their playstyle is exactly how low tier / secondary league in lpl lck plays, try to take random skirmish, macro = group 5 on 5
[1:55:01] BootOfficiaI: @alrealre yeah they also have a very interconnected support network

[2:06:27] TheWolmer: What does chat think of imortals?
[2:06:27] chrisrox22: there are no good adc's in NA
[2:06:29] rofflepie: turtle need a aggrro play making support in lane like mata
[2:06:33] AlmightAza: i think DL was doing a heap of shotcalling or something, during the split they were making good fast macro decisions, but at msi they just looked completely lost
[2:06:54] AlmightAza: maybe it was a patch maybe they were unprepared who knows
[2:07:12] BootOfficiaI: when turtle was on twitch at MSI and it was literally bjerg and his frontline iirc not letting him make the plyas he wanted to consistently
[2:07:16] leng_: flashback of sven giving free double buff to faker at msi 4Head
[2:07:25] Midnight_League: actually svens was the worst at msi not turtle
[2:07:26] BootOfficiaI: and some ppl were smart enough on reddit to realize that
[2:07:35] TheWolmer: Svens hero pool is sick
[2:07:37] BootOfficiaI: but the majority literally blamed turtle
[2:07:38] AlmightAza: and i think NA has a huge fear of trying new talent
[2:07:40] tollimar: Double just need to show it to world right Kappa
[2:07:40] 디플: sven lul
[2:07:44] BootOfficiaI: that pissed me the fuck off
[2:07:59] rofflepie: parth just has no idea whats good and bad in new patches, remmeber MSI 3 years ago (the one edg one), in the TSM video they were literally all like we got the most OP comp ever, no way to lose what to ever, but they got stomped cause they thought ziggs was super OP or something
[2:08:03] chrisrox22: sven is the best jg NA worst jg world
[2:08:13] BootOfficiaI: sven LUL
[2:08:21] AlmightAza: ye @MattSangPark the whole team just didnt look the same at all
[2:08:23] Midnight_League: you can't expect much from turtle , he isn't a world class adc , just look at his positionning
[2:08:30] BootOfficiaI: WHAT?
[2:08:35] Outslugger1: THIS GAME'S STILL GOING
[2:08:36] TheWolmer: Sven aint super bad the problem is his hero pool
[2:08:38] BootOfficiaI: wildturtle isnt world class but he's fine
[2:08:44] Bedroevelse: DoubleLift is kinda cute tho LUL
[2:08:46] BootOfficiaI: whatever im done talking about turtle the bias is just too big
[2:08:49] Midnight_League: he was fine during msi
[2:08:55] leng_: like, you can be best jg in your region but those plays against skt were retarded
[2:08:56] TheWolmer: What did happend to flyquest`?
[2:09:01] Rohcas: sven is still tsm's 2nd best player tho
[2:09:06] Midnight_League: i just said , turtle wasn't the problem at msi , it was svens
[2:09:11] rofflepie: sven's playstyle has to invade, he cant just farm and counter gank, so against good teams that can hold lane and collapse they just auto lose
[2:09:15] BootOfficiaI: i wasnt talking to u midnight
[2:09:15] Eldar_Warlock: LUL
[2:09:18] ルナティックリュウ: ???
[2:09:18] AlmightAza: hauntzer is waaay more consistant than sven
[2:09:22] 甜野的小迷妹: How did Imay got baron...???
[2:09:29] Rohcas: the guy who said cody sun is best adc in the world calling me retarded LUL
[2:09:29] BootOfficiaI: LOOOOl
[2:09:32] Bedroevelse: I think TSM would do much better with a good coach tbh, individual skill is far from everything
[2:09:32] mujarshad: 3 nb died
[2:09:33] tollimar: Turtle is fine adc, but double is o fucking overhyped...one game he carries you the second one he loses you game.
[2:09:35] BootOfficiaI: i didnt even notice wtf, how did IM get baron
[2:09:36] Midnight_League: hauntzer wasn't as good at msi as he was in the split
[2:09:43] Rohcas: nobody from tsm was playing good in msi
[2:09:44] rkeere2: this chat 4Head
[2:09:50] Eldar_Warlock: @ThunBeast_TheThing Stop it FeelsBadMan
[2:09:52] yaaz000: imay might actualy win lmao
[2:09:55] Rohcas: hauntzer only good on tanks
[2:10:02] AlmightAza: @Midnight_League naw, none of them were imo
[2:10:03] BootOfficiaI: no, tsm can only play w/ tanks
[2:10:06] rofflepie: bjerg played fine, did more than his share
[2:10:11] 디플: i think na pro having talent but they dont understand how are they good team fight
[2:10:12] BootOfficiaI: its not hauntzer
[2:10:14] FishRoeSoup: why dont u guys admint LUL tsm is greater than skt
[2:10:17] yaaz000: 1teamfight won end game
[2:10:17] tollimar: Hauntzer Jebaited
[2:10:22] Rohcas: no bjergn underpoerformed aswell
[2:10:22] BootOfficiaI: ppl needa stop blaming individual players too much
[2:10:23] rkeere2: KR>EU>Taiwan>China>Na
[2:10:27] 성품: Watching China's, talking about NA's 4Head Classic LPL chat I love that 4Head
[2:10:37] BootOfficiaI: its mostly on the team for how they play around certain picks. mechanically, LCS players are beast
[2:10:43] leng_: @FishRoeSoup would be gullible had it not been for msi LUL
[2:10:44] Eldar_Warlock: 4Head
[2:10:47] Midnight_League: true , svens is actually pretty predictable , take some questionnable decision and loses almost every match up in jungle
[2:10:51] FishRoeSoup: 4Head Phoenix 1 > SKT 4Head
[2:11:00] Bedroevelse: Which is the best team in EU atm? Been away from the whole scene for a year or so
[2:11:03] rofflepie: he underperformed for his peak, but he played well relative to al lthe mid laners there, hled his own against some of the worlds best and perks
[2:11:12] Midnight_League: even peanut said it was easy playing against him , and peanut is far from being the guy who trashtalks for fun
[2:11:16] chrisrox22: sven is predictable but still best jg in NA
[2:11:16] AlmightAza: when sven plays his best he is unbelievable
[2:11:19] leng_: Fnatic are dominating so far
[2:11:21] tollimar: Its easy logic - team sucks, I can blame all players lul. Kappa
[2:11:24] BootOfficiaI: like ppl were blaming deft and his top laner for dying to kalista/rakan combo
[2:11:24] Rohcas: @Trollpappapinne fnatic currently
[2:11:25] Eldar_Warlock: @ITzOLGoN_MVGame Whats the difference? 4Head
[2:11:38] Shijiazhuang: LPL games ResidentSleeper
[2:11:44] rofflepie: deft playing like crap in the series against SKT, r u serious
[2:11:59] rofflepie: they were on the way to snowball that game to the end at 25mins then deft got caught twice in game 3
[2:12:00] ルナティックリュウ: L
[2:12:02] BootOfficiaI: it had more to do with lane assignment and vision than the players
[2:12:06] Eldar_Warlock: @ITzOLGoN_MVGame LPL fanboy spotted SoBayed
[2:12:09] BootOfficiaI: but ofc ppl will blame players
[2:12:23] Eldar_Warlock: @ThunBeast_TheThing Another LPL fanboy SoBayed
[2:12:25] Bedroevelse: Does EU actually have a chance at taking world's this season?

[2:13:08] Midnight_League: looks like u didn't watch xmithie for a long time
[2:13:12] BootOfficiaI: xmithie was sorta bad before
[2:13:13] Jackp0tta: gg

[3:34:02] rofflepie: galio just walked at them, if elise CCed her they have no CC left for anything else
[3:34:09] jungchaeyeon01: cmonBruh <- lucian
[3:34:11] rofflepie: ori didnt want to waste shockwave on galio only
[3:34:30] FishRoeSoup: well nunu is just useless, if u cant counter jg or something to make enemy useless, u become even more useless
[3:35:12] Sickosno: froskurinns' hair is always so gooooooooood
[3:35:32] FishRoeSoup: nunu is only viable top lane Kappa best counter to panth
[3:35:41] rofflepie: ivern is just better version of nunu in the jg now
[3:35:59] leng_: of all the better support choice you pick nunu LUL
[3:36:01] G8NGAS: nunu supp can work, just not against we hard engage comp, galio + braum follow + luc AA's + rengar = nunu useless af
[3:36:10] nichtDose: PulseChamp
[3:36:34] aeztyr: Hate Nunu, but he was the highest winrate in jungle in 7.12 lol
[3:36:41] superhalo0: @terrorsq nah it was imp 2 and godv 3 lol pyl was like 15
[3:36:48] rofflepie: that was pre surgery pyl, all his skills went awaywith his old nose
[3:36:57] FishRoeSoup: and nunu actually doesnt work well with kalista, kalista usually has excessive attack speed, nunu's w becomes not as effective as casting it on IE adc
[3:37:05] superhalo0: Agreed
[3:37:06] G8NGAS: lmfao
[3:37:18] na_hardstuck_at_walmart: an insect WutFace
[3:37:25] chokepanda: SourPls
[3:37:32] SavageMemeMeltWorldDream: ANELE /
[3:37:32] rofflepie: he was def top 5 HEADING to worlds
[3:37:37] superhalo0: He was dirty in summer
[3:37:53] rofflepie: he got cocky after the lpl win and didnt practice much for worlds
[3:37:56] aeztyr: Give 957 his Kled Kappa
[3:38:00] superhalo0: His orianna and syndra were really good and then like idek
[3:38:12] rofflepie: he plays so much chinese MMO last 2 years chinese fans flamed him for that
[3:38:23] superhalo0: Lmao
[3:38:26] 만두보이: lgd lost their coach right before worlds and then they collectively played like shit
[3:38:29] aeztyr: MMO is good
[3:38:31] G8NGAS: if their plan was actually to pick nunu from the start, kalista pick is the best way to get some self peel
[3:38:48] SavageMemeMeltWorldDream: duDudu duDudu duDudu
[3:38:55] Escapee1: CHANGED HIS NAME
[3:38:57] rofflepie: tilted and doesnt want to play anymore

[3:39:04] rofflepie: he streams now
[3:39:20] rofflepie: he didnt say official retire
[3:39:30] rofflepie: but he is not looking for team atm
[3:39:34] Boogielol: who is "he"?
[3:39:38] rofflepie: godv
[3:39:45] Boogielol: ah lul
[3:39:51] zerox__: goldv?
[3:39:54] Boogielol: der most overhyped mid laner
[3:39:59] Boogielol: the*
[3:40:27] Boogielol: goldv xDD
[3:40:31] Remortus: 2 400 lul
[3:40:33] rofflepie: his biggest weakness is roaming, he stays in lane too much, so lgd ditched him for cool cause mid laners need to roam way more now
[3:41:06] Boogielol: y roaming was kinda always important at mid to carry games
[3:41:17] rofflepie: also demands too much resource, taking all of tbq chickens and stuff season 5
[3:41:24] SavageMemeMeltWorldDream: RlyTho
[3:41:28] Remortus: Name a more iconic duo: Frosk and LGD
[3:41:31] rofflepie: first week of lpl, eimy got mvp, post game interview
[3:41:45] rofflepie: they asked eimy wahts the biggest difference to allow u guys to win this game
[3:41:50] rofflepie: eimy said "mid lane"
[3:41:57] Remortus: Faker and world titles
[3:42:37] SmellyGoatZ: TriHard

[3:43:56] zerox__: tsm could
[3:44:04] SmellyGoatZ: tsm lul
[3:44:10] rofflepie: wolf is acutally prob one of those super insecure people, cause his fat and stuff (korea hates on fat ppl way worse than NA), so he keep a cocky facade to hide his insecurity
[3:44:17] nichtDose: @Zer0x91 TSM wont even be at worlds this year LUL
[3:44:28] Zeno420Zoldyck: tsm LUL stop daydreaminqg boi
[3:44:30] zerox__: tsm numba 1
[3:44:50] FishRoeSoup: tsm has the best top mid jg adc sup in the world Kappa literately impossible to lose to skt
[3:45:01] G8NGAS: I have faith in kt rolster god squad to beat skt this worlds
[3:45:06] rofflepie: c9 is not making worlds at this rate
[3:45:27] rofflepie: kt rolster need a new AD to beat skt, deft is too tilted for some reason now
[3:45:31] nichtDose: Immortals and DIG will go instead of c9 /TSM
[3:45:35] na_hardstuck_at_walmart: honestly tsm is at least as good as the top turkish team
[3:45:41] 만두보이: c9 will make gauntlet almost for sure
[3:45:44] lbh49: LUL
[3:45:45] rofflepie: his old strength (late game teamfight) is his biggest weakness now
[3:46:07] Zeno420Zoldyck: thats not exactly an achievment
[3:46:10] Moeesy: imp on kog Kreygasm

[3:46:55] Siciliasandro: BigBrother BigBrother
[3:47:08] 만두보이: ssumday isnt even carrying dig
[3:47:09] G8NGAS: I think immortals will fall off at playoffs, it will be disputed by tsm and dig
[3:47:14] Symphoneers: Gonna send TSM again so Doublift can int into Uzi some more.
[3:47:19] Escapee1: trade for lira to dig
[3:47:21] 만두보이: half the time dig looks like hes inting half the time hes carrying
[3:47:28] Boogielol: if clg woulda bench darshit..
[3:47:54] darkrainbow154: yes let tsm go to worlds so Na can embarass themself abit more hahaha
[3:47:55] 만두보이: he makes some stupid ass decisions
[3:47:57] Midnight_League: keane is improving a lot , shrim is pretty good , not a big fan of the bottom lane tho
[3:48:04] Escapee1: darshan makes no sense
[3:48:18] Boogielol: shrimps yum yum
[3:48:40] areallynicehotdog: i think the should perma swap lod and big for altec and adrian
[3:48:48] Symphoneers: Problemsom neaceClown
[3:49:01] G8NGAS: true altec is really good same to adrian
[3:49:09] Escapee1: keane really has improved but dunno, dude is 50/50 still
[3:49:10] 만두보이: altec and adrian just joined the team
[3:49:36] Boogielol: tsm should trade doublelift for deft Keepo

[3:49:47] CarlitosWay: LUL
[3:50:09] Boogielol: who? xD

[3:50:51] jaekun93: whos hashinshin never heard of that b4
[3:51:00] na_hardstuck_at_walmart: hautzer already signed, can't put him in a team that deserves his #1 top laner skills :(
[3:51:01] Fuzz_box: TTours TTours

[3:51:31] cryptus__: DARSHIT BEST TOPLANER WORLD PogChamp
[3:51:35] Hasapin: NA
[3:51:39] rofflepie: darshan does his split thing ok, but they will never be a good team cause darshan cant team fight, monte said this years and years ago when darshan and shiphter joined dig
[3:51:43] Fuzz_box: Hashinshin can't hold a candle to former TSM top laner, the legendary inter himself Rain man
[3:51:43] Boogielol: hauntzer haha xD
[3:51:44] Outslugger1: hashinshin is just a meme LUL

[3:52:50] Greensleeves97: Why does the video look so weird
[3:52:54] rofflepie: they cant play 5 on 5 comps cause darshan doesnt play team fight well
[3:53:03] rofflepie: its not just about split pushing
[3:53:06] Escapee1: cant remember the last tp play i saw darshan make
[3:53:07] na_hardstuck_at_walmart: @Greensleeves97 It's re-streamed from youtube
[3:53:10] jaekun93: Korea is better than NA at League
[3:53:11] Escapee1: nothing memorable
[3:53:12] lbh49: they don't have access to the proper stream for some reason

[3:55:21] Wombey: @jaekun93 well hes not an american player

[3:55:58] galvatorex34: TSM>SKT>TRASHCAN>EU LUL SwiftRage
[3:56:03] rofflepie: i cant find it right now, but look at waht monte said about darshan and shifphter when they first switched to Dig, i dont agree with monte on most things but his analysis on darshan is spot on and still holds this day
[3:56:14] rofflepie: its one of the monte thorin videos
[3:56:27] jaekun93: @Wombey I know the team that played at MSI this year as well, TSM
[3:56:36] rofflepie: when they joined dig?

[3:57:09] rofflepie: watch it and u'll see lots of it still holds
[3:57:09] Escapee1: darshan is the exact same player he ever was
[3:57:14] Art1ficer_: yep...
[3:57:15] Xreal11: tsm fan LUL what a tard
[3:57:21] Boogielol: feels like 5 years tho or even more xd
[3:57:23] Art1ficer_: minions mvp
[3:57:40] Escapee1: i used to watch his stream and it was like pulling teeth to get him to practice relevant tanks
[3:58:02] G8NGAS: players improve as time passes but they dont normaly change their play style, darshan is still the same bruh.. barely improved
[3:58:11] eat_a__snickers: tsm best team world PogChamp
[3:58:21] Escapee1: took forvere for him to maokai
[3:58:29] sixfootfourBTW: youtube stream of lpl looks like its in 480p FeelsBadMan
[3:58:43] Escapee1: most dont
[3:58:47] eat_a__snickers: TSM is honestly on the same level as skt right now PogChamp
[3:58:49] rofflepie: then why do u say he is the best player on clg ..
[3:58:55] na_hardstuck_at_walmart: honestly people are hating on tsm too hard, they're about on the smae lvl as skt
[3:59:07] rofflepie: when stixxay and moo (when not engaging randomly) is palying much better
[3:59:20] G8NGAS: best player on clg this season is huhi/aphro imo
[3:59:40] rofflepie: huhi still loses lane though, but he is getting much better and wins sometimes
[3:59:49] jaekun93: Oh i remember now from another MSI is Darshan the indian guy on CLG
[4:00:05] Escapee1: yes
[4:00:18] icu2_: @anele_stockholm_anele TSM PogChamp Kappa
[4:00:30] Escapee1: i wish i was still a teenager, you guy shave such simple fun
[4:00:31] yukinobestgirl: 3000 viewers LPL, is LoL dead?
[4:00:31] Topentakiller: yes
[4:01:04] DefyPhysics: nope nobody knows how to understand the casters native language
[4:01:06] G8NGAS: yeah but huhi literaly looks like a new player to me this season, i dont think xmithie was the problem but he def improved a lot
[4:01:11] eat_a__snickers: lpl has like a mil+ views on pandaTV LUL
[4:01:16] Art1ficer_: there are like 300000 viewers on the chinese strem probably
[4:01:36] rofflepie: huhi has a unique way of playing the game, not just on a sol
[4:01:39] G8NGAS: I always thought xmithie a good player since he joined clg
[4:01:41] DefyPhysics: these casters speak weeb
[4:01:51] jaekun93: Yeah this is for English speaker that interests in LPL which are not many
[4:01:53] DefyPhysics: i don't dare comprehend the mongrels
[4:01:59] rofflepie: sometimes he would give up 2 waves to do the most random things, so the other team never except mid laner to roam at that point
[4:02:07] rofflepie: never expect*
[4:02:16] eat_a__snickers: Pyl roam PogChamp
[4:02:28] G8NGAS: xmithie gragas is pog champ
[4:02:34] Chaotic_Old_Bore: cohhBoop
[4:02:49] Batoja: TSM is at their strongest, they wouldn't get out of groups at worlds as always xd
[4:03:52] G8NGAS: tbh I really agree that tsm should have a sub jungler, sven tilts too much and doesnt play like he should when he's behind
[4:04:05] Escapee1: corki is a sign of an unhealthy meta
[4:04:14] rofflepie: tsm need a early game jungler that can dictate pace of the game (but not like sven and invade 100% even without lane priority)
[4:04:21] G8NGAS: still sven's lee is sick when he gets on a roll
[4:04:27] rofflepie: someone like season 3 meteros
[4:04:27] DefyPhysics: Corki is a sign of male enhancement
[4:04:32] rofflepie: dictate his own pace
[4:04:34] DefyPhysics: how many female corki pros are there?
[4:04:46] Art1ficer_: I wonder if riot will ever do any base code reworking like even in 20 years
[4:04:52] Escapee1: make sense
[4:04:52] Art1ficer_: probably not
[4:04:54] michaelsund: r/tsm leaking as usual EleGiggle
[4:05:05] LETS_GET_SOME_KAPPAS_BOYS: @Clunk_Smash ya right LUL
[4:05:11] Escapee1: theyll kill this game before they make a new client
[4:05:22] cryptus__: TSM AT RIFT RIVALS LUL
[4:05:30] G8NGAS: I wouldnt say like an early game junglers bcuz sven fits that role, more like a teamfight jungler like xmithie, some who can play tank junglers really well
[4:05:30] rofflepie: this game is gonna be VR in 5 years
[4:05:39] Hugh_Lovett: is r/tsm any worse than r/clg?
[4:05:47] DefyPhysics: They threatened suing a player that did make a better alternate client
[4:05:55] DefyPhysics: so he took it down stoped updating
[4:06:04] FishRoeSoup: lgd winning early game again? CoolStoryBob nice false hope bait
[4:06:15] DefyPhysics: Just riot things
[4:06:20] Escapee1: developing a new client from scratch isnt money they(tencent) want to spend
[4:06:25] rofflepie: tsm has no clue how to macro mid game, they need someone that leads, bjerg doesnt do it / doesnt want to do it, people say double shot calls but his shot call are mediocre at best
[4:06:34] FishRoeSoup: LUL
[4:06:52] Escapee1: tsm strats - hide in a bush and hope they facecheck
[4:06:55] DefyPhysics: How will WE come back
[4:07:00] Batoja: TSM is too much NA
[4:07:06] DefyPhysics: for does IMP return to the his enhanced male form
[4:07:25] rofflepie: tsm also goes into turtle mode with the slightest disadvantage early game
[4:07:27] FishRoeSoup: IMP WHY ??? Jebaited
[4:07:33] G8NGAS: bro bjegrs try hards too much trying to shotcall/play really well at the same time, some who could shot call mid game would be perfect for their jungler role
[4:07:40] G8NGAS: bjerg
[4:07:40] Hugh_Lovett: Jebaited
[4:07:42] rofflepie: ya
[4:07:46] nintendolama: Hey look LGD ahead
[4:07:49] FishRoeSoup: ONE MORE WAVE Jebaited
[4:07:51] rofflepie: thats why i said they need a jungler that dictates his own tempo of the game
[4:07:57] DefyPhysics: TSM just need blank
[4:07:59] Escapee1: the good teams do manage to play from behind, it's rare in LCS
[4:08:00] nintendolama: Wonder if they will throw again Jebaited
[4:08:00] decco41: TSM is too strong it makes other regions hopeless to beat them TearGlove
[4:08:01] stirefy: 4k lead time to throw again
[4:08:05] DefyPhysics: and faker
[4:08:08] G8NGAS: plus it would improve bjerg mecha play by a lot
[4:08:28] nintendolama: FLAMER
[4:08:29] rofflepie: maybe regi should just go korea and pay rush a visit
[4:08:34] DefyPhysics: Heck TSM should import KKoma and his mother
[4:08:41] FishRoeSoup: 5k gold lead at 18min CoolStoryBob will lgd throw again?
[4:08:44] LETS_GET_SOME_KAPPAS_BOYS: Twitch chat analysts are so smart PogChamp they know exactly how to fix TSM PogChamp
[4:08:46] decco41: SKT wishes they have Bjerg instead of washed up Faker TearGlove

[4:09:01] rofflepie: some teams do it, depends on the person
[4:09:04] Escapee1: i would hate to be on a team with a jungler reliant on being directed
[4:09:04] DefyPhysics: @Terrorsq I mean bang does some shotcalling for dragons
[4:09:09] DefyPhysics: and objectives rotatation
[4:09:12] michaelsund: TSM now that doublelift is back will be unstoppable and will dominate WORLDS and they are the only team that can defeat SKT in WORLDS and they will prove it in RIFT RIVALS #TSMWORLDCHAMPS

[4:09:26] FishRoeSoup: yeah adc has to watch his mouse click most often out of 5 members, and he has to shotcall lol
[4:09:29] rofflepie: I would make good calls on TL

[4:10:55] DefyPhysics: I think Xpecial wins worlds

[4:11:11] eat_a__snickers: Rush is destroying KR soloque incoming rank 1 PogChamp
[4:11:16] G8NGAS: if only biofrost could shotcall the entire game...
[4:11:17] rofflepie: if u ever watch his stream, he gets lots of information from enemy cs numbers, how the laner is cheating, etc to know wher ethe other junger is
[4:11:26] G8NGAS: or at least mid game
[4:11:32] decco41: @eat_a__snickers really? BibleThump
[4:11:43] FishRoeSoup: LUL PACKAGE?
[4:11:48] DefyPhysics: Xpecial since he is Humble. and says its to big of a goal to attempt winning worlds he is using reverse psychology
[4:12:07] eat_a__snickers: his name rush25 on opgg PogChamp
[4:12:20] G8NGAS: and ya DL knows how to play macro really well but it's hard to shotcall when u're on a carry role (mid/ad)
[4:12:34] G8NGAS: and at the same time focus on ur gameplay
[4:12:36] FishRoeSoup: @eat_a__snickers from s4 rank 1 to this BibleThump
[4:12:39] padhlala: H2K VS MISFITS HYPE PogChamp
[4:12:54] rofflepie: the role of the shot caller is acutally ok on a carry cause they understand relative power lvl in a game the best
[4:13:15] eat_a__snickers: @FishRoeSoup he was really inactive for a long time just recently started again
[4:13:15] DefyPhysics: @G0NGAS If your a natural shotcaller if could even help you start more focused in those roles but only if it comes easy
[4:13:32] G8NGAS: but thats not the main focus of a shotcaller, u can just call that and you dont need to be the main shotcaller
[4:13:52] FishRoeSoup: @eat_a__snickers what was he doing? went for army?
[4:14:33] G8NGAS: a main shotcaller should be really focused on what to do now and preparing what to do next
[4:14:33] DefyPhysics: lgd perfect game
[4:14:37] rofflepie: making calls based on relative team power is the most imporntat part cause it allows u to chose to make play here, fight for this dragon, contest or not contest, know the win condition and choose to snowball / stall

[4:15:03] rofflepie: like faker said, the most important calls are, fight, or disengage
[4:15:07] G8NGAS: u can't do that at 100% efficiency if u're on a carry lol
[4:15:53] 甜野的小迷妹: 30 mins later chat still talking about DL NotLikeThis

[4:16:09] FishRoeSoup: @甜野的小迷妹 or lets talk about meiko KappaPride
[4:16:19] G8NGAS: it's like lvl16 kassa, u dont need to be the shotcaller to know that ur mid is on a powerspike...
[4:16:30] Art1ficer_: knowing when you should fight or not is so hard in a 5v5
[4:16:38] 甜野的小迷妹: KappaPride I'm saving that for Sunday @fishroesoup

[4:47:36] G8NGAS: imp cosplaying rekkles Kappa
[4:47:42] MlSTERniceGuy: @haji194 They almost had to. They banned 4 or 5 adcs
[4:47:44] rofflepie: they liked how rengar galio combo worked last game
[4:47:48] rofflepie: i mean in game 1
[4:48:02] 0dd__: EU vs China would be a lot more exciting than EU vs NA FeelsBadMan
[4:48:08] haji194: it's that its kinda dead pick in the next patch FeelsBadMan
[4:48:13] ezart159: Who rekkles ???

[4:48:50] CJDM310: @Arhowe you're right NA about to destroy EU like they went 7-1 in the last 3 riot sponsored tourneys
[4:48:50] nintendolama: Uhh
[4:48:56] haji194: EU vs LCK would be more exciting Kappa
[4:49:05] ESTEpo: as long as it is not G2 let eu play ResidentSleeper Keepi
[4:49:10] Moeesy: ?
[4:49:23] G8NGAS: remember when imp made deft cry Kappa
[4:50:05] rofflepie: NA will prob get stomped at rift rivals, c9 p1 is slumping hard, fna is on a roll
[4:50:21] rofflepie: tsm is prob 50 50 against g2, but other 2..
[4:50:21] 0dd__: FNC vs C9 has always been a hype matchup PogChamp
[4:50:28] haji194: @cjdm310 EU still has overall better record head to head vs NA ^^
[4:50:29] rofflepie: fnc is playing p1
[4:50:35] 0dd__: fnc plays everyone
[4:50:40] 0dd__: it's round robin
[4:50:45] rofflepie: they changed the format?
[4:51:06] MlSTERniceGuy: Rift rivals is another irrelevant tournament. Msi and worlds counting
[4:51:08] 0dd__: yeah, was an update about it a couple of weeks ago
[4:51:12] MlSTERniceGuy: @haji194 Do they?
[4:51:24] haji194: yes
[4:51:32] MlSTERniceGuy: @SMALL13999 I am not LOL

[4:51:38] stirefy: G2 might choke but Fnc and Uol look super good
[4:51:38] nintendolama: Did he cancel an auto?

[4:53:23] rosetulet: TSM LUL
[4:53:35] rpk99: Still think tristana wouldve been better
[4:53:35] haji194: actually tsm looked better with turtle than doublelift but their playstyle sucked
[4:53:42] galvatorex34: TSM now that doublelift is back will be unstoppable and will dominate WORLDS and they are the only team that can defeat SKT in WORLDS and they will prove it in RIFT RIVALS #TSMWORLDCHAMPS PogChamp
[4:53:43] MlSTERniceGuy: @galvatorex34 Proving at rift rivlas? Therefore u implement that EU is the closest to skt 4Head

[5:00:14] aeztyr: @haji194 or bring Untara and let Huni at home lol
[5:00:15] rpk99: So is rift rivals 1 sub only?
[5:00:21] MlSTERniceGuy: y
[5:00:30] yoft1: I think untara will stay home honestly
[5:00:39] aeztyr: @rpk99 like every international competition
[5:00:48] haji194: @aeztyr i mean they won msi with peanut and huni, but knows Kappa
[5:00:50] MlSTERniceGuy: You can have more subs at worlds guys
[5:00:53] rofflepie: the rift rival line up been annouced for days now
[5:00:56] PapaSmithy: I remember casting Master 3 FailFish
[5:00:57] MlSTERniceGuy: Rift rivlas is limited with 1 sub
[5:01:01] rofflepie: peanut is going, untara is not
[5:01:07] weebonduty: what about TehePelo CurseLit ?
[5:01:07] MlSTERniceGuy: @PapaSmithy Dade Kreygasm Kappa
[5:01:09] aeztyr: @haji194 and on LCK they're doing poorly lol
[5:01:10] 삼도천심해어: Master 3 LUL
[5:01:25] yoft1: blank is so much better
[5:01:31] yoft1: than peanut
[5:01:36] haji194: @aeztyr LCK > MSI Kappa
[5:01:43] aeztyr: Peanut was the best til MSI to be honest
[5:01:47] haji194: or even worlds Kappa
[5:02:01] G8NGAS: peanut lee is better thats all
[5:02:05] yoft1: thats true but blank has gotten so much better and peanut is slumping atm
[5:02:08] aeztyr: Because he bring Rox Tigers to a great spot
[5:02:11] MlSTERniceGuy: @alrealre Right, rather take only untara instead of both.
[5:02:23] MlSTERniceGuy: @alrealre Doesnt make to much sense
[5:02:25] errorm28: i would take untara and blank
[5:02:32] rofflepie: cause peanut is kkoma's secret weapon, he uses peanut to abosrb all of the other team's prep and research time
[5:02:32] aeztyr: Me too @errorm28
[5:02:36] rofflepie: then set in blank
[5:02:37] 삼도천심해어: extra thicc WutFace
[5:02:38] G8NGAS: lee's peanut > rush > sven | rush nida > all
[5:02:45] MlSTERniceGuy: @alrealre Then why do you say let peanut at home?
[5:02:46] chokepanda: LCK&LCS CHAT ROOM Kappa
[5:02:51] tasalta: why couldn't WE do this in 2nd map. dik heds.
[5:03:06] aeztyr: @chockingpanda better than this game lol
[5:03:06] MlSTERniceGuy: @alrealre I would rather take more subs than let them home and mybe regret it.
[5:03:35] Boogielol: nobody talks about lpl 4Head
[5:03:42] rofflepie: NA is already qqing about 1 sub, if u allow more subs...
[5:03:46] G8NGAS: I meant lee's: *
[5:03:49] chokepanda: @aeztyr LUL TRUE
[5:03:50] Art1ficer_: ahhhhhhhhhhh

[5:05:07] yoft1: untara and blank as a duo has been so much succesful in the summer season
[5:05:08] rpk99: Rift rivals is on 7.13 right
[5:05:15] aeztyr: How brave lmao
[5:05:22] Avenuee3: Imp playing Rekkles 4Head
[5:05:27] lzhm: LUL
[5:05:27] G8NGAS: having a sub opens up so many doors but u need a smart coach to use it effectively
[5:05:38] MlSTERniceGuy: @alrealre Havent skt played with 2 subs at 16 worlds?
[5:05:40] haji194: 7.12 prob
[5:05:50] rofflepie: no
[5:05:51] Bandillo64: no last worlds just had 1 sub
[5:05:59] G8NGAS: having a sub ad <
[5:06:05] MrTyson: Untara has been godlike as a solo. Huni just isn't that good.
[5:06:11] SirNickolaus: 1 sub
[5:06:27] MlSTERniceGuy: @alrealre Its about rift rivals not worlds
[5:06:29] aeztyr: @alrealre vs Blank
[5:06:33] DefyPhysics: Untara is really consistent
[5:06:38] nintendolama: Type 1 for lgd win Kappa
[5:06:44] Avenuee3: Untara overratedd af he is playing in SKT and he is worse than Profit
[5:06:53] Redace_: Wasnt huni good pre msi?
[5:06:55] DefyPhysics: Well huni is super bad then
[5:07:00] aeztyr: Let's face the facts SKT likes the youngers
[5:07:01] yoft1: but he is performing better than huni
[5:07:02] MrTyson: Untara was rank 1 in KR...
[5:07:03] Redace_: Oh am i high
[5:07:06] DefyPhysics: Hes feeding on skt
[5:07:07] Topentakiller: does blank even have practise with huni they always swapped bot didn't they?
[5:07:09] Avenuee3: soloq mean nothing
[5:07:11] Redace_: Or*
[5:07:16] stirefy: Blank is not as good as score
[5:07:30] Moobot: No links allowed (alrealre) (warning)
[5:07:36] DefyPhysics: @stirefy His winrate is :P
[5:07:40] Avenuee3: Smeb Score Faker Bang Wolf the real best of the best
[5:07:45] kelkelkelvin: no dmg
[5:07:50] errorm28: COOL USELESS
[5:07:51] MrTyson: Galio ResidentSleeper
[5:08:01] haji194: why are they fighting FailFish
[5:08:03] DefyPhysics: @unlikemike123 they sub him out for untara and blank after he lose first game
[5:08:12] aeztyr: Galio in 7.12 bunBoosted
[5:08:12] yoft1: i would take mata over wolf but thats my opinion
[5:08:14] G8NGAS: I think faker will force huni bench just bcuz 2 junglers Kappa
[5:08:19] nintendolama: Galio is really balanced I heard
[5:08:23] stirefy: not hard to have a good winrate playing with the 3 most consistent players in the last 3 years
[5:08:23] rofflepie: blank out played score hard in 2 of the 3 games last week
[5:08:33] Redace_: Fighting again PogChamp
[5:08:34] rofflepie: score had a good reksai game but got owned mid game
[5:08:34] stirefy: lmao
[5:08:38] aeztyr: @yoft1 but Wolf is the only real Support in the world lmao
[5:08:41] stirefy: Blank was inting on elise
[5:08:50] Redace_: China fighting 24/7
[5:08:54] stirefy: he just has Faker Bang and Wolf
[5:09:02] adamxx: pulse's casting right now are pretty bad FailFish
[5:09:12] aeztyr: Faker in 2k17 Kappa
[5:09:18] DefyPhysics: @alrealre Big difference between solo q and LCK
[5:09:30] aeztyr: Faker "the fast killed on MSI history"
[5:09:42] adamxx: sometimes he is decent
[5:09:42] DefyPhysics: @alrealre They play solo q after super hard practice all day and ofcourse they don't take it as serious
[5:09:46] MlSTERniceGuy: @alrealre It seems that u really have only 1 sub at the events
[5:09:48] haji194: he's not that bad
[5:09:49] iPMaTRiX: Pulse is just a another memer and a bad one at that
[5:09:52] Avenuee3: Profit looked super good when he is playing for SKT but now he is so bad if you have Faker Bang and Wolf in your team you are playing super good
[5:09:58] 삼도천심해어: KT LUL
[5:09:58] yoft1: MVP is going to RR btw
[5:10:05] yoft1: LUL
[5:10:05] G8NGAS: individually mata is better than wolf imo, just wolf is too good starting teamfihts and overall
[5:10:08] DefyPhysics: @alrealre Tell that to his and blank 100% winrate scrub
[5:10:36] Redace_: I would like to see deft on skt even though i prefer bang
[5:10:40] adamxx: it just seems like he doesnt have things to say he just keeps saying oh this guy got caught again oh this guy died like really obvious stuff
[5:10:44] rofflepie: fun fact, faker has the first death of last MSI and had the last kill as well
[5:10:44] Redace_: See how he is
[5:10:47] Zeno420Zoldyck: galio balanced af
[5:10:50] stirefy: if someone thinks Blank is better than Faker, Bang or Wolf because his winrate is higher....
[5:11:07] DefyPhysics: Faker is better then blank but faker is also faker
[5:11:09] nintendolama: I never want to see a galio in a game please
[5:11:10] tasalta: i hate WE so much why couldn't they play like this in map 2
[5:11:19] deadcarnie: fuck your crocs, we got gators here
[5:11:23] aeztyr: Well, if we think overall, being a good solo player sometimes does not make you a good teamplayer. That's one of the reasons SKT wins and TSM is not even in playoffs
[5:11:30] TheFurioso: GALIO BALANCED
[5:11:32] Rainladking: i put 100 on WE winning
[5:11:33] rofflepie: cause galio lives with 20% hp on these engages, they had kog last game
[5:11:39] aeztyr: (In MSI)
[5:11:41] yoft1: TSM LUL
[5:11:41] rofflepie: if they had kog right now galio died 4 times already
[5:11:43] Boodster: there are blind people that listen to casters for twitch games btw. So even if he says the obvious things, its meant for those listening and not watching/cant watch
[5:11:47] Redace_: Tsm LUL
[5:11:55] Perothegreat: tsm lul
[5:11:59] MlSTERniceGuy: @aeztyr That is called knock-out stage
[5:12:01] CJDM310: gg ez
[5:12:08] nintendolama: @rofflepie they banned like every adc
[5:12:08] adamxx: SKT unsung hero is bang the guy just does not get caught and has the best positioning
[5:12:13] aeztyr: @misternoizzguy oh thanks
[5:12:15] kelkelkelvin: gg
[5:12:18] rofflepie: i saw
[5:12:24] MlSTERniceGuy: @aeztyr You´re welcome
[5:12:26] rofflepie: i am responding to the guy that ask why cant WE do this game 2
[5:12:27] G8NGAS: alright game is over boys, as I said 30min win ezpz
[5:12:29] Redace_: Galio is actually retarded
[5:12:36] stirefy: Bang is the second best player in the world and the best performing player at the moment
[5:12:37] Redace_: Wtf
[5:12:41] Rainladking: @Boodster maybe if i were blind LGD would disappoint me less
[5:12:45] adamxx: often not talked about @Terrorsq
[5:12:49] Paputsza: Not spoken of
[5:12:49] aeztyr: Still, TSM and TiltedTurtle were disgusting
[5:13:05] rofflepie: if only rumble had equlizer
[5:13:08] stirefy: he pops off without need of his team giving him resorces
[5:13:10] Boodster: @Terrorsq Unsung means someone not taking credit for so many things he should take credit for.
[5:13:19] adamxx: not much he is usually taking a back seat to faker and whoever is jungling
[5:13:33] aeztyr: Bang is a good example in this Soloq thing. I watch his streams and he is almost always carried lmao
[5:13:37] G8NGAS: rito nerfs to galio were perfect lul Kappa
[5:13:38] yoft1: NA soloqueue is very low quality thats why
[5:13:42] nintendolama: Ngl this game should be over by next 5 minutes
[5:13:45] lzhm: 20:10
[5:13:47] Redace_: NA players like to do stuff besides solo queue ex gym girlfriends etc.. meanwhile korea plays solo queue 24/7
[5:13:54] deadcarnie: faker sucks and is overrated
[5:14:06] yoft1: @Redace14 that is what makes KR so much better ..
[5:14:12] DefyPhysics: @alrealre Wolf is hard stuck in masters tier soloq
[5:14:14] Redace_: Exactly
[5:14:29] DefyPhysics: @alrealre Diamond1
[5:14:32] adamxx: i dont see faker having super better mechanics than other great players i think faker just has vision that other players dont have he sees plays before they happen
[5:14:38] mbergman22: Unwept, unhonored and unsung
[5:14:43] Boodster: we are talking about the game lol. Who cares if they got other things to do? good for them but thats why they wont win worlds ever

[5:20:22] eat_a__snickers: guess imp is fine with just winning 3 things his career LUL
[5:21:03] G8NGAS: uzi and imp are dumb rich
[5:21:21] na_hardstuck_at_walmart: dunno specifics but it's pretty obvious imp is gonna be paid a lot more
[5:21:22] G8NGAS: ad life feelsgood
[5:21:26] rofflepie: they all make good money, but ppl like imp, marin makes like 2 to 3 times more than the locals
[5:22:14] G8NGAS: I wouldn't say he's washed up tho
[5:22:17] slopefield: cringing so hard right now
[5:22:20] rofflepie: but ppl like lgd cause htey have imp, and his return of investment is way higher than waht they pay
[5:22:29] rofflepie: too much money in lpl scene
[5:22:42] benqu17: galio plays are always the same
[5:22:52] rofflepie: plus they dont have a very good replacement lined up atm
[5:23:30] rofflepie: also, prior this this year, a big part of player salary is paid y big stream sites
[5:23:42] Rainladking: guy on the left is 10x better commentator than the chick in the middle
[5:23:50] Rainladking: sub him in coach
[5:23:54] rofflepie: face recognition is more important than skills for the stream sites
[5:24:30] rofflepie: the stream sites are acutally not getting much investment return
[5:24:43] rofflepie: so they are paying a lot less this year now
[5:24:54] rofflepie: tahts why lots of lpl player went to NA acutally
[5:24:58] G8NGAS: bruh how do u know this shit?
[5:25:14] G8NGAS: are u chinese?
[5:25:16] rofflepie: ppl discuss this stuff all day on chinese forums
[5:25:21] na_hardstuck_at_walmart: rofflepie is lowkey the twitch ceo
[5:25:34] eat_a__snickers: imp actually doesn't get more views than popular chinese players
[5:25:54] rofflepie: not just looper, but also players that would be in lpl 2 years ago, in the same situation
[5:26:03] rofflepie: like sssumday
[5:26:14] rofflepie: beginning of seaseason 5, if ssumday left kr
[5:26:20] rofflepie: he is in lpl for sure
[5:26:54] rofflepie: the point is, lpl is not as attractive as it was 2 years ago, both from money and chance to win worlds
[5:27:16] rofflepie: so ltos of players thats in NA, would be in china instead, given the same situation 2 years ago
