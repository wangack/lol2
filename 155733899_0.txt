[3:11:41] Shuwarin: China pays a lot
[3:11:50] Ryan_TheLegend: Smeb is best top laner in the world by far
[3:11:59] xiaowu7: avoidless is disturbing the coach
[3:12:22] Ryan_TheLegend: I still think Duke is dumb :/

[3:14:16] Shuwarin: Man it happened with the ten samsung boys
[3:14:26] Shuwarin: I think its pretty common
[3:14:40] Shuwarin: To choose money over winning
[3:14:45] Ryan_TheLegend: Does anyone know what happen to samsung white? Or is that Samsung Galaxy?
[3:14:47] BlazingHigh: Be Lonely, suffer loneliness. It's difficult, meditation is difficult BibleThump
[3:15:01] Shuwarin: it´s samsung galaxy
[3:15:11] Shuwarin: sister teams dont exist anymore
[3:15:11] rofflepie: duke already won worlds, maybe he wants a new challange, and esports career is short, nothing wrong with making some real money before it ends
[3:15:13] Ryan_TheLegend: oh okay
[3:15:41] Kenbristolmedia: yeah!! more jarvan note taking.....for the 40th time
[3:15:53] rofflepie: in a few years this game might not even exist anymore, and none of their skills transfor to anything else, need to be set for life while u can
[3:16:05] Ryan_TheLegend: Faker and koma gonna be like 40 still playing
[3:16:10] xiaowu7: samsung white is a history
[3:16:24] Ryan_TheLegend: well koma coaching
[3:17:08] Shuwarin: it is possible for them to move to another game but its not something you've got for sure
[3:17:31] Ryan_TheLegend: I dont think league will die. Dota maybe
[3:17:54] Shuwarin: it will eventually, not soon tho
[3:19:04] goliahtz: Beşiktaş ESPORTS

[3:32:03] FishRoeSoup: LUL
[3:32:09] 甜野的小迷妹: yeah
[3:32:37] 甜野的小迷妹: @FishRoeSoup Classy meme right there
[3:32:44] FishRoeSoup: Keepo
[3:32:54] xiaowu7: Mingkai is the best
[3:33:30] xiaowu7: I like edg
[3:33:36] 甜野的小迷妹: I'm scared to say that he's a good jungler now already
[3:33:46] 甜野的小迷妹: got flooded by haters last year
[3:34:31] FishRoeSoup: ankai is the best*
[3:34:38] rofflepie: 7-chan can get to worlds again if they upgrade adc, or if zet plays even normal LPL lvl
[3:35:10] xiaowu7: Zet is difficult to be deft
[3:35:27] rofflepie: he doesnt need to be deft, edg is a mid focus team now anyways
[3:35:29] ESTEpo: VoHiYo
[3:35:33] rofflepie: he just need to not feed every other game
[3:35:48] FishRoeSoup: they couldve even got vasilii instead of zet, what a waste of import slot
[3:36:01] rofflepie: pick team fight adc, learn to team fight, meiko will carry him in the lane
[3:36:21] 甜野的小迷妹: @
[3:36:34] xiaowu7: And i believe clearlove
[3:36:51] xiaowu7: He will bring us surprise
[3:37:30] FishRoeSoup: one day clearlove will make semis
[3:37:35] rofflepie: he should just play like bengi now, vision focus, counter gank focused. His old style in season 3 and 4 fits him the best
[3:38:08] rofflepie: he can carry on khazix, but his leesin is still bad
[3:38:26] 甜野的小迷妹: He doesn't have to play lee sin
[3:38:35] rofflepie: he doesnt but he picks it still
[3:38:38] 甜野的小迷妹: Now that lee sin is not t1
[3:38:47] xiaowu7: He will prove himself
[3:38:54] solcius: LEe is t1 ALWAYS
[3:39:07] pineapple_on_pizza: eh
[3:39:11] 甜野的小迷妹: Not the first priority
[3:39:16] solcius: much better than gragas or kha for sure
[3:39:23] pineapple_on_pizza: lee is pretty bad rn
[3:40:01] xiaowu7: In fact he can play leesin good
[3:40:13] 甜野的小迷妹: Gragas can be a flex so it can confuse opponent during banpick
[3:40:31] FishRoeSoup: and nunu as well
[3:40:35] 甜野的小迷妹: He can play it in ranks but not as good competitive
[3:40:37] solcius: if you say so,
[3:40:47] solcius: guess ur new to this game
[3:40:54] rofflepie: no he cant, as fzzf said, if leesin doesnt have the kick back move clearlove would be the best leesin in the world
[3:41:10] rofflepie: he just doesnt engage on it nearly as good as top leesin players
[3:41:43] 甜野的小迷妹: Ik lee is always there to be picked, but in this meta there are other choices unlike last year's worlds when there were basically Lee and Olaf
[3:42:09] FishRoeSoup: yeah lee sin is actually broken for having too many dashes, not hard to pull off like people exaggerated
[3:42:10] TACONINJA782: LUL
[3:42:20] solcius: if something i learned in this game, playing since beta is that competitve is like "fashion"
[3:42:27] 甜野的小迷妹: And sadly clearlove is not as good on these two as other junglers
[3:42:34] solcius: oh the new fashion is to not pick lee, they do not
[3:42:34] pineapple_on_pizza: idk wehneve i play a gainst a lee in soloq they get shit on
[3:42:40] solcius: next week they pick it a lot
[3:42:53] rofflepie: 1 lvl insec is easy now, acutal engages like mlxg on bang at worlds or clid on mystic is very hard still
[3:43:09] xiaowu7: Why not say peanut is better in leesin
[3:43:45] rofflepie: clearlove is still on the, R flash stage, he doesnt even know how to ward hop insec properly yet
[3:44:05] xiaowu7: You are right
[3:44:16] TheSnackRap: H4cker hahAA 12 BTW
[3:44:25] xiaowu7: But i love clearlove too much
[3:44:26] TheSnackRap: kms FailFish
[3:44:32] TheSnackRap: H4cker haHAA 12 BTW
[3:44:41] FishRoeSoup: r flash is way easier than ward hop
[3:44:47] rofflepie: clearlove is actually good on khazix though eventhough it is not super meta atm
[3:44:48] Senor_Squid: Kassadin into full ad team how did this happen
[3:45:06] rofflepie: if world patch goes to tank junglers or heavy carry jungles he can shine again
[3:45:18] Senor_Squid: There had to have been better mids up
[3:45:24] xiaowu7: Like 2015msi?
[3:45:35] solcius: kassa can buy Gauntlet
[3:45:51] mujarshad: BM zhonyas Kreygasm
[3:45:55] solcius: and fenfen is a beast with kassa haha
[3:45:56] bluestorm1998: gg
[3:46:04] rofflepie: kass is picked basicly before anything was shown and into a blind pick, fenfen doesnt care
[3:46:06] 藤和エリオ: bad game
[3:46:12] TaylanCan: OOOOOO LPL1 OOOO ALIRIM Bİ DAL
[3:46:14] rofflepie: his kass is 100x better than his next best champ

[3:59:26] TheFriedPig: People keep talking about a young EDG ad carry who's being hyped up
[3:59:28] FishRoeSoup: yes
[3:59:43] rofflepie: that guy is even younger than jackylove atm
[4:00:03] TheFriedPig: How good is that EDG adc?
[4:00:08] FishRoeSoup: ig fans: if we have jackylove now we can win worlds Kappa
[4:00:28] rofflepie: around same lvl as jackylove, but u never really know with these prodigy players, how they develope
[4:00:47] rofflepie: they both play in TGA right now
[4:01:37] TheFriedPig: Is he only gonna join lpl in season 8?
[4:01:52] rofflepie: i would have to look up his actual age
[4:02:30] TheFriedPig: If EDG missed worlds for the first time.... :(
[4:03:01] rofflepie: apprently he can play in july
[4:03:17] rofflepie: not sure if thats true or not
[4:03:23] bluestorm1998: No Deft and Pawn no worlds Kappa
[4:03:37] TheFriedPig: Scout replaced pawn well
[4:03:49] TheFriedPig: Zet can't replace deft
[4:04:46] rofflepie: rofl his id is literally De1ft
[4:05:06] rofflepie: prob change his ID in lpl though
[4:05:17] TheFriedPig: Lul, he literally knows he's gonna be replaced very soon
[4:06:00] FishRoeSoup: fever reksai CoolStoryBob
[4:06:17] rofflepie: if the new ADC comes in this month and does well, zet is prob gonna be a flex mid / adc sub from now on
[4:08:35] FishRoeSoup: varus stop getting hit by everything LUL
[4:10:51] FishRoeSoup: REPORT VARUS ASSISTING ENEMY TEAM
[4:12:49] bubblebubblebutt523: Can we have marge back?

[4:18:22] FishRoeSoup: WHY.. IS..VARUS...THERE... LUL
[4:18:38] rofflepie: can we just get kid back, kid is better than this...
[4:18:55] Namigod: is it just me or did varus even get paid by the team?
[4:19:06] FishRoeSoup: varus get paid by steve
[4:19:11] Namigod: cuz he's not playing like he's paid
[4:19:30] rofflepie: he is totally playing like he is being paid (by the other team)
[4:19:48] Hydro_Pwnics: haHA u 2 are neato
[4:20:39] FishRoeSoup: i thought win trading only exists in solo q, until i see this game CoolStoryBob
[4:20:55] rofflepie: IG invented win trading
[4:21:03] rofflepie: remember ig vs pgd in sesaon 5
[4:21:07] FishRoeSoup: IG vs LGD 2015?
[4:21:28] FishRoeSoup: that 1-1x tbq j4 Kappa
[4:21:28] rofflepie: that was the epitome of both teams playing to lose
[4:22:30] FishRoeSoup: yeah that was so bad that the production had to call a pause to tell them to fking end it
[4:22:47] rofflepie: to be honest, there prob WAS some win trading in lpl in season 5, the bo2 system is designed to be win traded, since teams play each other twice
[4:23:06] rofflepie: if u go 1-1 1-1 twice, both teams gets 2 points, if u go 2-0 once and 0-2 once, both teams get 3 points
[4:24:51] FishRoeSoup: oh wow really.. i never thought about that before, no wonder lpl has no ties Kappa
[4:25:14] Namigod: maybe this is just a typical galio game, wait till galio is so tanky and then 1v5 and end the game
[4:25:33] rofflepie: caitlyn is ahead of curve, they'll be ok

[4:35:21] FishRoeSoup: get tarzaned and vasilii will mentor him to become a nice friendly player
[4:35:49] edgelordweeb: i'm pretty sure vasili could legit bash tarzaned's head in
[4:36:02] rofflepie: vasilli is actailly chill 99% of the time, he just cant control his emotion sometimes but he is nice normally, nothing like tarzoned at all
[4:36:05] FishRoeSoup: Keepo

[4:57:15] 甜野的小迷妹: but probably will still go 0:2 against skt cuz of their performance last time against NB
[4:57:44] 甜野的小迷妹: they only won that series because NB just did not know how to handle a lead or how to do baron
[4:58:35] salmantank: SHUT THE BLEEP UP
