[2:43:39] ye1l: @myprecioussosnowy Sure, but the team will never ever hit the ceiling that they need to hit to make worlds while playing with JunJia that's the issue. Sure their reg season record will be better and they won't look as bad if they never find that stability with Jiejie and play JunJia instead, but they're simply not going to go anywhere while playing JunJia

[2:45:23] myprecioussosnowy: @ye1l you're making so many "never" statements, jiejie isn't that great of a player, he definitely isn't the Viper of edg, and your philosophy is all team members play to one jungler, while EDG just wants a jungler that plays around their lanes, that's just another way to play the game

[2:45:52] fykeryjuth: @ye1l while i do agree jiejie is very good, if the team's working better with junjia thats the only option. Should fpx have kept nuguri after the under performance of the team just because hes an individually good player? No, because in the end all that matters is how the team functions together

[2:47:34] 98Kuroko: 2022 i mean
[2:47:37] fykeryjuth: @myprecioussosnowy now you are just a delusional jiejie fan, because to say edg laners were "runing it down" last split just tells me your analisis is utterly garbage
[2:47:39] stuffedStickyRiceRoll: real money guise because gamers like us have no life and our entire narrative is comical
[2:47:39] myprecioussosnowy: @ye1l nah, that's your opinion, in my mind EDG always won off the back of Viper Meiko, and Flandre on Graves

[2:49:33] 哈哈哈哈哈哈哈123: Who won ?
[2:49:47] Renakka: edg
[2:50:21] Waizenblizz: @TheOreoCupcake if a jungler can be the number one in the world even for a short period of time he is not a bad player and can become the best again in a similar meta
[2:50:23] myprecioussosnowy: @ye1l again, that's another opinion, you rank jiejie high, but I wouldn't even put him in top 10 jungler of lpl, even when they won worlds
[2:50:31] irlgigachad: @ye1l dont follow edg, but how are they utilizing flandre these days, is he still mostly weakside/ an after thought?
[2:50:56] chanobaby23: SCORE GUYS?
[2:50:56] TheOreoCupcake: @Waizenblizz Never said JieJie is a bad player. Junjia is just better in this time period KEKW This meta is good for Junjia.

[2:52:39] TheOreoCupcake: @Waizenblizz The point was just why is Junjia playing rn instead of JieJie. Junjia is way more proactive. Ganks like SoloQ. Wukong, Poppy and Trundle, he's good on.

[3:00:18] myprecioussosnowy: @tenhaotzu SeemsGood
[3:00:27] ye1l: and should aim for at least making Worlds which will be really really rough with JunJia

[3:19:15] BLG_worlds_2024: is it still a hot take to say Shanji might be the best LPL top?

[3:20:38] Nxvxck: map 1
[3:20:46] eLZ0rr0: @RNG_Worlds_2022 Better than wayward, more consistent than TheShy, only 369 might rival him for the Nr. 1 spot
[3:21:12] ye1l: EDG beat WBG with Jiejie, Jiejie was Elo helled by his team against JDG and TES and was absolutely not the reason his team lost. AL is literally the best team that EDG beat with JunJia... Of course JunJia is going to look better when he's playing vs way way way worse teams... Twitch chat making up opinions based on literally nothing but results with no context
[3:21:26] Jaqxzy: IG 2.0
[3:21:37] vinglaive: Gamba ?
[3:22:01] ye1l: @RNG_Worlds_2022 He isn't, his mechanics are completely awful and 369/TheShy is much better than him on literally any champion in the game that isn't a tank and even then 369 is very good at tanks
[3:22:04] ttvcoelho: IG Will take

[3:22:38] LaatiMafia: I'm a Yuumi main, how did you know GIGACHAD
[3:23:35] untimelyten: @ye1l what about the gigachad LCS talent summit on weakside
[3:23:40] iwillgo1day: lissandra open?
[3:23:47] untimelyten: Kappa
[3:23:56] myprecioussosnowy: @ye1l your "context" is so biased, "ello helled" is an opinion, the fact is junjia has had much more impact on the map versus jiejie ever was, and to your argument, in the RNG vs EDG, jiejie was insta-loss, and junjia was win game 2, your analysis isn't thorough at all
[3:24:11] ye1l: @ye1l he's in the top 10 and better than Rich at least
