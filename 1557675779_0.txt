Playing with JunJia is the same as surrendering the entire season to avoid the risk of "not looking bad" when they literally aren't winning anything anyways
[2:42:15] myprecioussosnowy: @ye1l yes I watched this pslite, they've been looking pretty bad, but you're pinning it all on jiejie/junjia, when the rest of the team just looks off, junjia makes up for that instability, but jiejie can't

[3:05:20] TheOreoCupcake: JieJie played against the "top teams" like TES, V5 and JDG and lost all of them.

[3:06:17] ye1l: @myprecioussosnowy The different path will never yield results that's the issue. dropping out in the middle of playoffs and not making Worlds is not "getting results" for the team that literally won Worlds last year....
[3:06:27] jetlagging1: IG is gonna get smashed
[3:06:34] myprecioussosnowy: @theoreocupcake seriously, it's like the titanic ramming into an iceberg, even though they could've avoided it altogether
[3:06:35] odka_winter: omg only shanji gigaman
[3:07:11] TheOreoCupcake: @myprecioussosnowy They lost 2-0 to JDG, TES and V5 with JieJie. It was a 2-1 loss against RNG with JieJie in game 1 KEKW
[3:07:23] SirGarland: TT fans: IG WIN PLS PoroSad

[3:12:02] percgod21007: they are really showing highlights vs ring ResidentSleeper
[3:12:12] ye1l: @myprecioussosnowy ??? they were literally on track to make playoffs with jiejie despite having already lost to all top 4 teams, they literally only ever beat a decent team with Jiejie which was WBG
[3:12:17] TheOreoCupcake: @myprecioussosnowy Forget winning worlds. If they lose against V5, They won't even make worlds KEKW
[3:12:40] ye1l: With JunJia they've only beaten really bad teams that they would've beaten even if they had h4cker in the jungle
[3:12:56] myprecioussosnowy: @theoreocupcake I don't believe in V5 bo5 Kappa but we'll see
[3:13:20] TheOreoCupcake: @myprecioussosnowy It depends on which V5 show up. The one that beat TES or the one that lost to OMG KEKW

[3:20:37] ZubL7: go that new champ
[3:20:38] Nxvxck: map 1
[3:20:46] eLZ0rr0: @RNG_Worlds_2022 Better than wayward, more consistent than TheShy, only 369 might rival him for the Nr. 1 spot
[3:21:12] ye1l: EDG beat WBG with Jiejie, Jiejie was Elo helled by his team against JDG and TES and was absolutely not the reason his team lost. AL is literally the best team that EDG beat with JunJia... Of course JunJia is going to look better when he's playing vs way way way worse teams... Twitch chat making up opinions based on literally nothing but results with no context
[3:21:26] Jaqxzy: IG 2.0
[3:21:37] vinglaive: Gamba ?
[3:22:01] ye1l: @RNG_Worlds_2022 He isn't, his mechanics are completely awful and 369/TheShy is much better than him on literally any champion in the game that isn't a tank and even then 369 is very good at tanks
[3:22:04] ttvcoelho: IG Will take

[3:22:23] gavilan62: bet please
[3:22:31] sshwy: ig no ad ???  LUL

[3:22:38] LaatiMafia: I'm a Yuumi main, how did you know GIGACHAD
[3:23:35] untimelyten: @ye1l what about the gigachad LCS talent summit on weakside
[3:23:40] iwillgo1day: lissandra open?
[3:23:47] untimelyten: Kappa
[3:23:56] myprecioussosnowy: @ye1l your "context" is so biased, "ello helled" is an opinion, the fact is junjia has had much more impact on the map versus jiejie ever was, and to your argument, in the RNG vs EDG, jiejie was insta-loss, and junjia was win game 2, your analysis isn't thorough at all
[3:24:11] ye1l: @ye1l he's in the top 10 and better than Rich at least
