[3:38:54] irlgigachad: @ye1l theshy usuaully has bad months or so and not full on splits iirc. But yeah there was a point where theshy was the biggest inter in the league
[3:38:54] OP_JOEL: bullying support D:
[3:39:18] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l TheShy and Zoom have had similar past few seasons. Didn't make playoffs in Summer 2021. Bad in Spring 2021.
[3:39:32] ye1l: @ye1l I mean that's just wrong, 369 gapped literally every toplaner but Bin and Nuguri in regular season in 2021 spring and he gapped Bin in playoffs too and at the end of summer when he came back he gapped Breathe when Breathe was widely considered the best toplaner in the world. 369 never ever hit a low point where he was actually bad, he just played below his usual standards
[3:39:35] cealan2015: blg blg blg
[3:39:42] jacquoz: Theshy has tendency to either really good or be a massive intet
[3:39:49] jacquoz: *inter
[3:40:05] ye1l: As for TheShy, he was still a top 3 toplaner for most of 2020 and he was literally the only reason IG made playoffs in 2021 spring, and when TheShy was gone for most of 2021 summer IG couldn't even make playoffs without him
[3:40:10] irlgigachad: lmao some of those theshy jayce games
[3:40:16] kemc2006: HeyGuys HeyGuys blg
[3:40:27] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l @ye1l Yeah no one thought Breathe was the best top in the world wtf
[3:40:35] tuanbagay1: kkk
[3:40:44] ye1l: TheShy and 369 simply played below their level, they were never ever actually bad, just worse compared to their own standard. Zoom is outright bad and has been for 3 splits now

[3:43:17] doge3x: @jacquoz i'd say part of it is due to the rejuvenation in botlane

[3:45:30] willy2896: not so ez but still win
[3:45:40] gendsi: up won first map for sure
[3:45:52] doge3x: crisp renata is probably best itw tho, at least from the ones i've watched
[3:45:54] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l Suning barely made playoffs in Summer 2021. Bin nor breathe was the best top in the world at that moment. It's better I stop arguing against bait takes like this KEKW
[3:46:23] splintso: @doge3x 100% agree
[3:46:23] Moobot: Follow the official LPL Twitter for news, highlights, and more! https://twitter.com/lplenglish
[3:46:31] jacquoz: what a disappointment UP are BTW. Cryin and ZOOM were hyped up but have done nothing all split.
[3:46:35] 잘자다: Figth go
[3:46:39] duatilu: someting wrong i can fell it
[3:47:16] 잘자다: Fight go
[3:47:19] doge3x: @jacquoz ehh I don't think many had them high on the power rankings, definitely not 3-11 bad though
[3:47:21] lcgbro123: @jacquoz yep
[3:47:24] sshwy: ?????
[3:47:27] BLG_worlds_2024: i refuse to be so critical of Zoom when UP has the worst jungler and 2nd worst supports
[3:47:31] jacquoz: WTF is zoom doing?
[3:47:35] kaungmyat171: 7-0 lol
[3:47:36] anhdaden_from_thanhhoa: TT AYAYA
[3:47:38] styxx92: classic zoom
[3:47:43] untimelyten: Kappa brother zoom you can't go that far into the jungle
[3:47:43] beatles0966: matchfixeddddd
[3:47:45] anakinpisswalker: that whole team is so bad lol
[3:47:47] TheOreoCupcake: @RNG_Worlds_2022 This new support is some random guy on UP KEKW
[3:47:48] kaungmyat171: zoom in meeting haha
[3:47:50] yylskr: NotLikeThis
[3:47:51] Winterfr3sh: 7 - 1 Prayge
[3:47:55] sshwy: Is zoom playing w minimap off ?
[3:47:55] aleks12101: What a noob Team
[3:47:55] kaungmyat171: quick 2-0 ez
[3:47:57] todoge8080: zoom? more like doom
[3:47:59] Norgos21: i hate end of regular split, 90% games are 322
[3:48:02] mesium: CRACKER KEKW
[3:48:05] benyeochickenriceburger: zoom has to be the biggest falloff ever. from jdg to one of the worst top in the league LUL
[3:48:07] o_skeever_travesso: 0/4 LUL
[3:48:10] yylskr: not like this UP TT ez win
[3:48:18] carrypotter67: 7-0 only 2k golds KEKW
[3:48:23] BLG_worlds_2024: @RNG_Worlds_2022 I mean, it's not like he is much of a downgrade
[3:48:27] ye1l: @ye1l Bin was the best player on SN by a long shot in 2021 summer. SofM and Angel were bots, ON was awful and Huanfeng was slowly turning into the LPL kekless he's become now
[3:48:28] TheOreoCupcake: @benyeochickenriceburger There have been bigger falloffs.
[3:48:35] risisjsbsja: Zoom mum boom
[3:48:35] IndicaEndeavor: UP support is so trash why is he playing instead of ShauC?
[3:48:41] Norgos21: Zoom did 0 ults, they just afk
[3:48:43] TheOreoCupcake: @RNG_Worlds_2022 ShiauC was bad,  this new guy is worse.
[3:48:45] benyeochickenriceburger: losing to 2 koreans who cant make it in lck LUL
[3:48:49] IndicaEndeavor: ShauC wayy better
[3:48:52] doge3x: it's crazy how zoom went from top 3 toplaners itw to this lol, feels like smeb all over again
[3:49:06] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l Being the best player on Suning isn't worth an award. Their team was inting in Summer 2021.
[3:49:25] ye1l: @TheOreoCupcake As for Breathe, he was literally the best player on that WE roster. Pretty much never ever lost or inted lane and he was the best Akali and GP player in the entire league in 2021 summer.
[3:49:33] BLG_worlds_2024: @RNG_Worlds_2022 at least it isn't Off
[3:49:42] TheOreoCupcake: @doge3x At least Smeb made worlds when he was washed in 2018 and took IG to 5 games KEKW
[3:49:51] solarisblue_: Can TT still qualify for playoffs ?
[3:50:02] kaungmyat171: yeah
[3:50:15] sshwy: Zoom wanted to be as good as nuguri and god granted his wish
[3:50:16] yylskr: positive
[3:50:17] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l Once again, you don't get an award for being the best player on the roster. You only get one for being the best player in that position across the league. I guess not much can go wrong when Beishang babysits you the entire game.
[3:50:19] tomsrogi: CS LUL
[3:50:24] solarisblue_: Ty
[3:50:30] theraiderrr: @solarisblue_ they can still win worlds
[3:50:32] kaungmyat171: If they win this game + RA
[3:50:58] kaungmyat171: nvm will get reket in playoff first round anyway lol
[3:51:00] akina_0623: @doge3x Duke took IG took game 5, TheShy almost 3-0 them KEKW
[3:51:02] doge3x: @doge3x oh yeah defo, just pointing out how both went to arguably the best top itw to washed
[3:51:18] Wickthorium: omg slowest play they can
[3:51:19] JINhyun008: TT 8-8
[3:51:22] BLG_worlds_2024: If UP managed to bring in pzx and just a mid tier support they could easily be a playoff team
[3:51:29] solarisblue_: @theraiderrr GenG…
[3:51:38] ripbettors: @kaungmyat171 ofcourse LUL
[3:51:41] TheBloodmaster1: elk will  carry
[3:51:42] TheOreoCupcake: @doge3x @doge3x Smeb had a longer peak. And 2017 wasn't even his fault.
[3:51:53] ye1l: @ye1l That roster doesn't sit top 3 in the league until literally the last week of the split if breathe wasn't the best top lol
[3:51:55] jacquoz: @rng_worlds_2022 hacker needs replacing first asap
[3:52:01] makibaoooo: who the name hero mid TT?
[3:52:08] cealan2015: up win please
[3:52:12] BLG_worlds_2024: @jacquoz pzx would be such a good fit
[3:52:13] NapletekGucia: fpx won bo?
[3:52:29] ziggyop: PotFriend
[3:52:30] rehs0m: @jacquoz ??? he literally just named a jg lol
[3:52:31] jacquoz: Hacker is honestly one of the worst junglers in LPL
[3:52:34] untimelyten: Kappa someone needs to check h4cker, I think he's been tampered with
[3:52:38] ultranovel: @makibaoooo ucal mid laner player talayh hero name
[3:52:41] ye1l: he was the best player on a team that was literally top 3 in the league for most of regular season and won 4 bo5s straight in playoffs
[3:52:42] falsoprofeta98: PotFriend <3
[3:52:45] aleks12101: @cealan2015 They noobbsss
[3:52:46] beatles0966: fps 2-0 win
[3:52:46] theraiderrr: @solarisblue_ geng will fail cause of poor cs of mid
[3:53:03] sshwy: Why TT not building anti tank items potential 322 game
[3:53:03] makibaoooo: @ultranovel thank you sir
[3:53:08] ripbettors: but UP is way better than WE. Man, WE is disgrace for lpl, the skill levels is way too low, very low
[3:53:13] TheOreoCupcake: @ye1l WE were 7th in Regular Season.
[3:53:19] doge3x: @doge3x agreed
[3:53:24] ye1l: @TheOreoCupcake not to mention that he absolutely bloodline gapped flandre and when RNG wasn't playing 4v1 toplane, he also made xiaohu look like a bot

[4:03:54] ye1l: @Er0yzer FoFo is not a bad player but he's the worst possible teammate. He has literally made people quit competitive play permanently after playing with him. Every jungler he has ever had has looked way way way worse while playing with him too....

[4:06:12] TheOreoCupcake: LDL talents when they come to LPL, it becomes really hard for most of them.
[4:06:14] doge3x: leyan is just really coinflippy, he could gap or get gapped by anyone
[4:06:17] tylerwizardman: you guys think female models should run around playing soccer too? this is the same. its fkn stupid and cringe, stay on the rift instead
