[0:45:58] Jax_6_gunblades: thats why i only watch na

[0:46:18] oldmansawce: True, na is definitely super competitive globally
[0:46:25] just_jayway: NA out of group stage LUL
[0:46:38] Jax_6_gunblades: worlds is only fun in group stage anyway
[0:46:41] FishRoeSoup: NA in World's semi Kapp.. iem worlds..
[0:46:46] CraxWayon: im surprised vasilli could ever find another team after he had that roid rage where he broke a bunch of monitors
[0:46:46] FishRoeSoup: Kappa
[0:46:46] PreacherCasts: @TehClownz We haven't lost a game at worlds yet
[0:46:49] FlipperMeTimbers: @mcrdisco if you stick around and watch a few more games this region always throws so it's just part of it...
[0:47:11] mcrdisco: @flippermetimbers alright cool lol
[0:47:15] decco41: na is not competitive, only tsm is outstanding and has the ability to crush skt
[0:47:25] oldmansawce: Wat
[0:47:25] FishRoeSoup: @k1a2p3pa yeah and everyone thought he would go downhill from there.. but obviously we r wrong Kappa
[0:47:25] alwaysbeclosing: hmm this caster is good, but i feel like he should tell me why the items purchased are objectively wrong
[0:47:33] oldmansawce: Clg will be fine
[0:47:36] just_jayway: @PreacherCasts this year's worlds will be different because of the play-in stage
[0:47:42] mcrdisco: @opieop_dansgame_opieop I'm a tsm fan boy and that's just not true
[0:47:55] PreacherCasts: @Riot_Jayway Bets are open!!!
[0:48:00] mcrdisco: @ftreprez65 clg is a 4th place team at best
[0:48:05] Itakura_StuGIII: @mcrdisco woosh Kappa
[0:48:12] just_jayway: if OCE makes it out of play-in stage, I will be surprised
[0:48:19] Jax_6_gunblades: tsm is just vacationing this split to be fresh at worlds
[0:48:21] oldmansawce: Yeah I agree, they should make worlds semis
[0:48:22] Art1ficer_: the whole world owuld be
[0:48:45] CraxWayon: are they finally making na and eu wildcard teams?
[0:48:57] mcrdisco: nb draft looks really bad. especially sense they aren't ahead
[0:49:01] just_jayway: i mean, the way NA has performed, I dont see why not
[0:49:20] just_jayway: this vasili ADC though, he might actually carry
[0:49:22] decco41: if tsm plays in lck they can at least gets top 2 no doubt
[0:49:24] michaelsund: But the $$$
[0:49:38] oldmansawce: He went ham last night also
[0:49:49] oldmansawce: Got a quadra on kog
[0:50:02] Jax_6_gunblades: but skt will sweep in 4
[0:50:16] alwaysbeclosing: but @Riot_Jayway they have triple AD?
[0:50:34] alwaysbeclosing: and the renekton is ahead
[0:50:34] just_jayway: ah good point, maybe not
[0:50:35] FishRoeSoup: which team has better late game>
[0:50:44] alwaysbeclosing: Kappa
[0:51:03] just_jayway: i respect the IE buy
[0:51:12] just_jayway: that's the man mode vasilli I know
[0:51:12] oldmansawce: Nb late game is good
[0:51:26] mcrdisco: corki does 80% magic damage.
[0:51:31] mcrdisco: he's not a real adc
[0:51:43] Itakura_StuGIII: corki is a mgc dmg dps
[0:51:45] just_jayway: lol this WE team
[0:51:46] FlipperMeTimbers: I'd say both late games are pretty even... New bee have the engage though
[0:51:50] Itakura_StuGIII: for if you have too much physical dmg in teamcomp
[0:51:53] pineapple_on_pizza: i would say the late game is even
[0:51:55] just_jayway: blows EVERYTHING on TK
[0:52:01] alwaysbeclosing: im not sure about you guys but id say the late game is even
[0:52:05] Jax_6_gunblades: ok not 80% but over 50
[0:52:11] Warwizard23: oo
[0:52:14] oldmansawce: Holy lul
[0:52:18] mcrdisco: @jax_6_gunblades it's 80%
[0:52:31] Art1ficer_: corki does like 90% magic actually
[0:52:33] oldmansawce: Cork I dropped the Valkyrie in the cataclysm
[0:52:37] Itakura_StuGIII: his autos are 80% mgc dmg, but you could say he does more than that in dmg output due to mgc abilities
[0:52:37] Art1ficer_: his autos do 80% magic, and all his abilities do magic
[0:52:41] Warwizard23: Poooound
[0:52:49] Art1ficer_: someone doesn't read patch notes :^)
[0:52:49] Jax_6_gunblades: autos are half and sheen should be doin more than 20% of his dmg
[0:52:51] cutiecat88: bless WE throwing so i have something interesting to watch
[0:52:51] decco41: Poooound
[0:52:56] PreacherCasts: 2.2k
[0:52:57] Art1ficer_: @Jax_6_gunblades read patch notes
[0:53:01] Jax_6_gunblades: w8 what
[0:53:01] PreacherCasts: You tried, Dom BibleThump
[0:53:05] mcrdisco: @jax_6_gunblades read patch notes
[0:53:09] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco just bcs he makes most magic damage doesn't mean he's not ADC lol. He did like 40% of magic damage in old seasons (season 3 or older). He was ADC just Riot changed his passive so he's fit as mid with his suicidal package more rather than botlane safe adc
[0:53:10] alwaysbeclosing: Rush BibleThump
[0:53:13] Art1ficer_: it's 80% magic now. and sheen proc is turned into magic too iirc
[0:53:14] mcrdisco: a
[0:53:15] LeCarry: vasilli poppin OFF after the NA bootcamp lul
[0:53:20] Art1ficer_: like 80% of sheen proc turns into magic right?
[0:53:33] just_jayway: Corki on average is like 75-80% magic damage
[0:53:33] CraxWayon: no his passive doesn't convert sheen damage
[0:53:36] oldmansawce: Rush BibleThump
[0:53:37] Art1ficer_: ok nvm then.
[0:53:44] mcrdisco: @regrup he's a mage marksman not an adc
[0:53:48] Art1ficer_: his base auto is 80% magic still
[0:53:54] Jax_6_gunblades: i have to read patch notes since 7.1 so i guess
[0:53:55] just_jayway: this WE throw smh
[0:54:01] Warwizard23: nice!!
[0:54:02] Itakura_StuGIII: @Regrup it's not exclusively a midlaner, he's can also be the mgc dmg marksman if you have a physical top/midlaner
[0:54:02] Jax_6_gunblades: so thats why he sees play?
[0:54:13] oldmansawce: I'm in love w da coco
[0:54:18] Art1ficer_: SHEEN IS TRANSFORMED into magic
[0:54:20] just_jayway: yeah, WE is the "best" team currently
[0:54:25] Art1ficer_: I just checked. get rekt chat.
[0:54:33] Art1ficer_: well 80% magic
[0:54:49] mcrdisco: @jax_6_gunblades yes he's a lot more efficient

[0:55:12] 提刀為汝斬天下: 2/5LMQ NA NO.3>WE LPL NO.1
[0:55:27] Jax_6_gunblades: corki is still real adc to me D :
[0:55:48] just_jayway: i dont think OMG is going to rift rivals right? it's top 4 from spring
[0:55:51] mcrdisco: well your name is @jax_6_gunblades soooo
[0:56:01] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco he have classic ADC items in his build. He can take botrk, any zeal items, IE or ER. And he AA alot. If it's not ADC playstyle than idk lol
[0:56:06] mcrdisco: @riot_jayway thought it was top 3?
[0:56:21] just_jayway: for the LPL/LMS/LCK regions, it's top 4 i thought
[0:56:35] just_jayway: NA/EU is top3?
[0:56:40] 抗吧凌风: top 4
[0:56:48] 抗吧凌风: for lpl/lms/lck
[0:56:55] mcrdisco: I only know for 100% it's top 3 in na
[0:57:11] mcrdisco: and P1 is gonna be one of those 3...
[0:57:37] Jax_6_gunblades: w8 lms got 4 seeds?
[0:57:52] just_jayway: Vasilii sponsered and paid by Jeep
[0:58:03] mcrdisco: @regrup he also builds good staff and that clown mask. he's a mage marksman
[0:58:07] just_jayway: yeah, the LMS/LCK/LPL event will be top4
[0:58:24] Jax_6_gunblades: well why tho
[0:58:31] mcrdisco: void staff*
[0:58:54] WhoKnowsUA: @Itakura_StuGIII i know but u can't really utilize his passive as botlane marksman. If u go in with package there is a chance to be focused and dies while being only one DPS champ in the team. He's better midlaner bcs of the passive and so he can go ALL IN without risking leave team without consistent DPSer bcs u will have other marksman in bot
[0:59:25] Jax_6_gunblades: its a sad mask and only it can understand my sorrow
[0:59:43] mcrdisco: That ausie should shave
[1:00:03] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco why wouldn't he build it if your Autos convert 50% of your AA damage into magic and your Q, W, R does 100% magic and E 80% magic and 40 phisical damage? U really retarded lol
[1:00:10] BerenCy: SourPls
[1:00:48] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco Last whisper works with Phisical damage which is only 50 of his autos and 20 of his E, and that's all lol
[1:01:12] pineapple_on_pizza: chat so hung up on corki lmfao
[1:01:21] mcrdisco: @regrup you're the one saying he's an adc lol. I'm explain why he's a mage marksman. your reading comp. skills are really low. and his autos are 80% magic damage no o ne build LW on corki
[1:01:42] pineapple_on_pizza: riot defines corki as a marksman, lets leave it at that
[1:01:57] 420juicelord69: why did they start early
[1:02:00] pineapple_on_pizza: he deals magi dmg, and scales with attack dmg
[1:02:10] pineapple_on_pizza: bye chat
[1:02:12] mcrdisco: @regrup you're to dense to have a civil discussion with.
[1:02:12] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco it's his unique playstyle lol. He's ADC WHO BUILDS AD DAMAGE ITEMS AND HAVE MAGIC OUTPUT. HE"S ADC MARKSMAN WHICH DEAL MAGIC DAMAGE WITH PHISICAL ITEMS. It's not a mage who goes MAGIC ITEMS TO DEAL MAGIC DAMAGE
[1:02:29] Jax_6_gunblades: >ad damage
[1:03:01] mcrdisco: @regrup rage more. he can build ap and often does
[1:03:22] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco He's AD CARRY bcs he build AD items as his Core. He have magic output but it didn't make him mage.
[1:03:26] Jax_6_gunblades: but werent his ap scales fked last year?
[1:03:58] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco u can go FULL AP corki as AP MAGE MID with MAsk Luden Rabado, THIS IS MAGE CORKI
[1:04:00] Escapee1: corki would do ap damage regardless of why he buys, is the difference
[1:04:04] mcrdisco: @regrup AD stands for attack damage. he doesn't deal attack damage you idiot
[1:04:07] CraxWayon: mage implies that he would be using magic but clearly he is flying in a plane so his ablities are mechanical and not magic Kappa
[1:04:07] Escapee1: he has both types
[1:04:13] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco when u build triforce into IE and Zeal it's and ADC DPS CORKI
[1:04:15] 420juicelord69: corki is an ad caster
[1:04:31] mcrdisco: he's a mage marksman
[1:04:35] Jax_6_gunblades: not even ad nomore boi
[1:04:40] mcrdisco: riot agrees with me
[1:04:54] Itakura_StuGIII: @k1a2p3pa technically, if it's hextech powered, it's magical TehePelo
[1:04:55] Jax_6_gunblades: yea cause rito knows best
[1:05:03] Escapee1: what a champ is referred to as by the fluff text is irrelevant
[1:05:04] Jax_6_gunblades: but you right
[1:05:08] mcrdisco: @regrup WAIT LET ME USE CAPS LOCK BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE THE WAY YOU COMMUNICATE
[1:05:09] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco how u call full AP corki with luden rabadon void mask mid then ? xDDD
[1:05:24] mcrdisco: @regrup different t
[1:05:34] Aberken: 2005 references LUL
[1:05:39] mcrdisco: play style that's less AA focused
[1:05:45] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco u can build him 2 ways as AP MID MAGE or ADC Mid/Bot caster DPS
[1:06:01] just_jayway: Corki is a Daring Bombardier, not an adc or apc or marksman or anything

[1:06:12] Itakura_StuGIII: vasili is gonna break someone if they feed LUL
[1:06:15] Jax_6_gunblades: but ap corki(unless he got buffed in s7) got fked last year
[1:06:23] mcrdisco: he doesn't deal attack damage. he cannot be an attack damage carry lmao
[1:06:26] CraxWayon: yeah ap corki is dog shit
[1:06:43] WhoKnowsUA: @mcrdisco your build conseder your playstyle if u bild AD items on corki u had to DPS and auto which is ADC playstyle. It doesn't matter what kind of damage u do AFTER calculations
[1:07:02] mcrdisco: You don't understand how words work
[1:07:03] 420juicelord69: Corki is a marksman about as much as orianna is due to his damage type changes
[1:07:41] FishRoeSoup: @Kyle__twitch its a risk. like no one knew a bench player of lspl would trash on mystic

[1:14:33] mcrdisco: You and the other caster
[1:14:39] 420juicelord69: @regrup the point is that his damage type is magic and he is ability based. he is not an adc. you can argue he is a marksman because of his auto attack based damage i guess, but like people have said, azir isn't a marksman
[1:14:52] PulseIRL: @mcrdisco Me :p Outside of Phreak I think I'm the highest rated PBP

[1:16:27] Jax_6_gunblades: yea a team with high skill will always make a region more competitive
[1:16:31] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 he have magic output. Right, but it doesn't make him mage. U can build him 2 ways, as AP mid corki with luden mask void rabadon or AD based triforce ie zeal botrk. And the second one is and ADC corki.
[1:16:49] Escapee1: lmq got rid of voyboy at least, that was an improvement of the scene

[1:17:06] BabyInAMicrowave: 631 ppl lol
[1:17:08] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 his build and playstyle consider him as AN ADC marksman, not his damage output
[1:17:34] mcrdisco: MDC marksman @regrup
[1:17:36] sickside_yu: 習包子 大撒幣
[1:17:38] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 Azir build have all AP items including nashor just bcs he AA alot
[1:17:52] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 so he's and AP mid mage
[1:18:02] goblinguy01: LMQ did train with OMG, OH my Dream and royal Club in S4
[1:18:07] mcrdisco: or mage is
[1:18:08] goblinguy01: You would hope they were good
[1:18:14] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 nuild corki the same way and u can call him AP mage
[1:18:17] mcrdisco: what people call MDC

[1:18:32] FishRoeSoup: corki is adc wtf is the problem? CoolStoryBob
[1:18:41] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 but if u build him with AD items it's not AP mid mage, it's an ADC caster DSP corki
[1:18:55] goblinguy01: Wait
[1:19:06] goblinguy01: Didn't LMQ have the same owner of Royal Club?
[1:19:13] goblinguy01: I thought it was all Chinese money?
[1:19:14] mcrdisco: and the XWX boosting service
[1:19:15] Namigod: the real problem is why is teemo an adc CoolStoryBob
[1:19:39] goblinguy01: Since they came from LpL. Lol
[1:20:03] goblinguy01: People called them Royal Club Na lol
[1:20:19] goblinguy01: It wasn't just a meme since they were bad in the LPL
[1:20:21] Namigod: i think
[1:20:22] PulseIRL: Legit seems like you guys are arguing semantics. You all agree about his variance in item builds KappaRoss
[1:20:25] 420juicelord69: @regrup adc stands for attack damage carry. Corki's primary source of damage is not physical. try building armor and see if a corki with ad items has trouble killing you(hint: he won't)
[1:20:27] Namigod: it was lolclass or something

[1:22:44] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 how will u call him when he builds luden rabadon mask void then?

[1:23:18] mcrdisco: @k1a2p3pa are you tell kled he isn't a man
[1:23:31] PulseIRL: I think regardless of Corki's build he's a hybrid caster champion
[1:23:46] mcrdisco: @regrup the same. he doesn't change as a champion with build.
[1:23:48] Jax_6_gunblades: corki is a tank
[1:23:50] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 Corki's primaric source of damage is AD when u build AD items, Bcs his skills scales with AD and passive convert AD damage into 50% magical
[1:23:53] Jax_6_gunblades: and thats a fact
[1:24:06] mcrdisco: @regrup 80%
[1:24:08] PulseIRL: Actually 80% magic
[1:24:22] Escapee1: you got a number wrong, it's over
[1:24:23] WhoKnowsUA: i am talking about his passive
[1:24:24] PulseIRL: If you go crit build corki you're doing mostly magic
[1:24:32] PulseIRL: Yup, his passive is 80/20
[1:24:35] PulseIRL: Weighted to magic
[1:24:37] WhoKnowsUA: but he scales with AD items and AA alot so overall it's 80%
[1:24:54] Jax_6_gunblades: but is t 80/20 100% of the time?
[1:24:56] WhoKnowsUA: his passive is 50/50
[1:25:02] Itakura_StuGIII: @zoomenhanced implying any of them will succeed LUL
[1:25:07] PulseIRL: Regrup, go look at the wikia real quick.
[1:25:12] mcrdisco: @regrup no it's not they changed it lol
[1:25:23] PreacherCasts: LOL! Canadian housing chat OP
[1:25:24] 420juicelord69: @regrup He is much more of an APC than and ADC whether he builds AP or AD. AD items are just more efficient to build in order to deal hybrid damage.
[1:25:26] calvinhwt: BRONZE CHAT LUL
[1:25:27] PulseIRL: I think that might change your whole argument TehePelo
[1:25:27] Jax_6_gunblades: how about the best team in na clg

[1:26:33] mcrdisco: @riotpulse next time you're on desk you should start a discussion on h
[1:26:33] PulseIRL: @Regrup To be fair it was a recent change but it's what triggered Corki coming back into Mid lane
[1:26:36] 420juicelord69: @zoomenhanced CLG is looking very good lately
[1:26:49] mcrdisco: if corki is an apc or adc
[1:26:52] PulseIRL: @mcrdisco I think we've done the Corki point to death at this point
[1:26:55] Jax_6_gunblades: corki got triggered?
[1:27:22] PulseIRL: Man, Void Rush is weird lol
[1:27:22] cutiecat88: WE throwing again LUL
[1:27:37] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 u call champion AP AD, depends on his builds actually, There is alot hybrid champs in league. Jax, Kayle for example which can be builded few ways but u call them by watching how they build, not which damage they do after all calculations
[1:27:45] PulseIRL: Sometimes it hits, sometimes it doesn't regardless of whether you dodge FailFish
[1:27:48] mcrdisco: kled ult is wanky sometimes

[1:30:29] Namigod: vasilii flashed into the small gap between cataclysm and the wall
[1:30:38] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 u can call him AP when his core is AP items, when his core is AD items like IE trofrice and Zeal he's an AD carry which scales from AD items which playstyle is similar to any other ADC caster like Lucian old Graves or MF, and they all can DPS after all. His outcome damage is magical bcs Riot forced it. But he's still an AD carry if he builds that way

[1:31:20] FishRoeSoup: shouldnt aim cait there, corki was stronger and with kills
[1:33:13] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 u're not calling Azir an ADC when he build full AP items right? Imagine Riot changed his skills to deal physical damage + his passive with autos and SUDDENLY u forced to build LW or lethality items instead of Void/Mask. Did u became ADC?
[1:33:18] FishRoeSoup: karma full support build LUL
[1:33:23] mcrdisco: Do corki crits deal in magic or physical damage
[1:33:24] Jax_6_gunblades: look at thay exciting wave clear Κappa
[1:33:50] Namigod: censer too strong lol
[1:34:27] mcrdisco: @regrup yes lol because he deals 100$%
[1:34:28] PulseIRL: Crits in relation to his passive so 80/20
[1:34:28] GummiGrim: @mcrdisco it's 75-25 magical/physical
[1:34:32] mcrdisco: ad now
[1:34:41] mcrdisco: @riotpulse #
[1:34:47] mcrdisco: thanks *
[1:35:05] 420juicelord69: @regrup Lucian is a perfect example to compare to actually, thank you. Lucian is an AD caster(aka ADC) and Corki is an AP caster(aka APC)
[1:35:09] FishRoeSoup: no such thing as ap marksman stop making things up CoolStoryBob corki is adc due to both itemization and playstyle
[1:35:31] Itakura_StuGIII: @jamesdd2147 corki doesnt build AP
[1:35:35] mcrdisco: @fishroesoup what is teemo
[1:35:42] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 Lucian, MF, Old and NeW graves have magic abilities in their kits
[1:35:45] PulseIRL: the devil
[1:36:00] 420juicelord69: @itakura_stugiii he deals ap damage?

[1:36:19] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 Ezreal have only 1 AD abilitty which is Q others deal magic damage but he's still ADC
[1:36:22] Itakura_StuGIII: @jamesdd2147 theres no such thing as "AP damage", there's AP and AD, which scale into physical damage or magic damage
[1:36:35] Namigod: more like KappaPride

[1:38:21] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 but u didn't answer about Azir. What if his skills scales off AP items but deal phisical damage, and to penetrate heavy armored targets u need to actually build LW/Lethality. WIll u call him ADC then?
[1:38:25] PulseIRL: He is the way I play him Kappa
[1:38:32] FishRoeSoup: statik shiv LUL
[1:38:39] Jax_6_gunblades: i play jax as a pve push top only

[1:39:05] PulseIRL: Then what is the point in building 6 gunblades if you don't use the active PunOko
[1:39:13] mcrdisco: @regrup I said yes
[1:39:26] FishRoeSoup: jax deals tons of magic dmg, but doesnt change the fact that he is still defined as an ad fighter

[1:39:54] PulseIRL: NB made WE angry rip
[1:40:04] 420juicelord69: @regrup uhh yeah in that case he'd be a carry based around dealing physical damage, sooo yeah pretty much ADC
[1:40:17] halloderbaer: RNG vs EDG later Kreygasm
[1:40:30] mcrdisco: these guys like to throw
[1:41:07] Namigod: is there a competitive game where full support karma worked
[1:41:14] 420juicelord69: BibleThump MFW WE forces game 3 and i have to wait for RNG longer
[1:41:24] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 Ezreal is and excellent example btw he can be builded both ways, as an ADC caster or full AP Ez with different playstyles. And Ez's abilities deal 3 of 4 magic damage but scales with both. But no one actually call triforce or gauntlet tier or even full crit items Ezreal an AP marksman. But u call Corki SUDDENLY

[1:43:12] jungchaeyeon01: NB lost monkaS
[1:43:45] FishRoeSoup: NB garbage draft and wrong focus in that early fight
[1:43:56] Itakura_StuGIII: karma mid LUL
[1:44:00] mujarshad: what's wrong with nb draft?
[1:44:14] FishRoeSoup: past 30min nb draft 100% lose
[1:44:14] mcrdisco: doesn't crown karma mid?
[1:44:16] Jax_6_gunblades: they lost thats whats wrongs
[1:44:24] mujarshad: lots of teams karma mid
[1:44:29] 420juicelord69: Karma mid so volatile
[1:44:39] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 THEY DO lol i just said it, He have both AP and AD scalings on E, Q and R. Just like Corki have on Q E and R
[1:44:40] Namigod: i think the problem is full support karma
[1:44:40] FishRoeSoup: u dont pick karma mid and build full support with no other carries
[1:45:06] mujarshad: yeah, so that's execution problem, not draft problem
[1:45:14] mcrdisco: @fishroesoup true
[1:45:18] 420juicelord69: @regrup yeah i get that but Corkis passive tho...
[1:45:29] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 he's similar to corki with double scalings and different playstyles while building AP/AD
[1:45:30] Itakura_StuGIII: its draft cuz not enough dmg dealers to support karma mid
[1:45:51] Itakura_StuGIII: and/or no hypercarry
[1:46:00] mcrdisco: @regrup who build ap ez Lol? giants gaming in 2015
[1:46:18] FishRoeSoup: whats worse is that they have varus adc..
[1:46:20] 420juicelord69: @regrup he is pretty similar but much more of a physical damage dealer
[1:46:31] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 the real difference isn't his passive but their penetration items which actually confuse ppl like u. Ezreal builds LW while Corki builds Void/Mask.
[1:46:38] envyubermagicman: Why the fuck was the score. Esportliveacore said 0 towers to 2 and 11 kills to 7
[1:46:38] Namigod: this reminds me of huhi's full support karma, exactly the same thing happened, and that was his first and last time go full support karma
[1:46:43] CraxWayon: varus is strong but he cant outdamage caitlyn + corki
[1:46:55] mcrdisco: @itakura_stugiii would have been better with a kog maw
[1:47:00] Jax_6_gunblades: i mean its a 2v1
[1:47:01] Itakura_StuGIII: yes
[1:47:12] Jax_6_gunblades: yes
[1:47:16] 420juicelord69: @regrup what's confusing about the penetration items?
[1:47:22] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 and that's bcs Ezreal's Tear playstyle is to poke with E which is his main ability that deal physical damage. Riot suddenly can change it to magic and u had to build Void instead
[1:47:38] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 with Q not with E my bad
[1:47:40] Jax_6_gunblades: >poke with e
[1:47:47] Jax_6_gunblades: pls no
[1:47:48] mcrdisco: kog maw does a lot more damage. and only thing varus offers that kog doesn't is a small engage
[1:47:58] WhoKnowsUA: i just changed it
[1:48:00] PulseIRL: That must be why my bot lanes always go 0/20/0 Kappa
[1:48:08] WhoKnowsUA: i did mistake
[1:48:21] mujarshad: poking with e Kreygasm
[1:48:27] FishRoeSoup: anyway NB's draft is terrible and shouldnt happen on this level
[1:48:34] WhoKnowsUA: and i changed it lol deal with it and move on already
[1:48:42] Namigod: holy shet
[1:48:51] j26martin: meiko daddy
[1:48:53] Jax_6_gunblades: we noticed
[1:48:57] Namigod: meiko barely have any muscle on his arm
[1:49:04] PulseIRL: This is twitch chat, we have to meme it first before we move on Kappa
[1:49:21] mujarshad: memes FeelsGoodMan
[1:49:22] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 the main thing why ppl being confused is when they see corki's build have AD items + Ap penetration items
[1:49:23] PulseIRL: lol Ming is great
[1:49:27] PreacherCasts: meMEE?
[1:49:48] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 he always was like that before his rework he had 40 or even 60% magic damage in lategame
[1:49:52] PulseIRL: Meiko eat a burger pls BibleThump
[1:50:00] mujarshad: I wanna watch uzi BibleThump
[1:50:03] fepl_: Meiko arm so small WutFace
[1:50:17] mcrdisco: @regrup I think your main confusion comes from not realizing how champions work and what thier passive do to damage profiles
[1:50:26] edgelordweeb: y4 Kreygasm
[1:50:27] Jax_6_gunblades: just eat meat and sniff 2 lines of creatin before sleep
[1:50:33] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 he was always considered AD carry with that build. He's been played mid and ppl is confused bcs of that + his magic damage + his penetration items so they start to call him an Mage
[1:50:38] FishRoeSoup: CORKI IS ADC NOW STFU SwiftRage
[1:51:00] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 he's midlaner bcs of his package, the main thing that didn't fit in botlane meta and playstyle
[1:51:04] PreacherCasts: We still arguing semantics in 2017?
[1:51:13] michaelsund: DBstyle TheThing
[1:51:23] Jax_6_gunblades: "you are a wizard corki" ~ obama
[1:51:25] PreacherCasts: Corki builds AD but doesn't do physical damage, so he's an ADC who does magic DPS. Settled.
[1:51:32] 420juicelord69: @regrup Yeahthats not confusing.. His skills scale with AD but deal magic damage
[1:51:48] mcrdisco: @preachercasts @regrup refuses to admit to not knowing how numbers work
[1:52:01] michaelsund: MingLee //
[1:52:15] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 but this conversation won't even started if he's been playing bot for the last 3 seasons i garantee u
[1:52:21] Jax_6_gunblades: ΜingLee
[1:52:28] mcrdisco: @regrup in 2014 you would build last whisper on corki
[1:52:43] mcrdisco: @regrup not void
[1:53:06] mcrdisco: @regrup so once again you're incorrect
[1:53:41] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 Ezreal is still decent botlaner and in early levels he have big chunk of magic burst at lvl 6 without AAing alot
[1:54:01] mujarshad: ezreal has like 46% winrate wut
[1:54:02] mcrdisco: @preachercasts he's an attack damage carry that doesn't deal attack damage?
[1:54:09] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 but no one even caring that 3 of his abilities deal magic damage and scales with both AD and AP items mostly
[1:54:20] FishRoeSoup: GUYS JUST GOOGLE "DEFINITION OF LOL ADC" AND SEARCH FOR THE FIRST RESULT AND THEN COMEBACK TELL ME WHAT CORKI IS SwiftRage
[1:54:27] PreacherCasts: @mcrdisco There's no such thing as attack damage. There's physical, magical and true damage.
[1:54:37] Jax_6_gunblades: google is fake news
[1:54:38] mcrdisco: @mujarshad he will do anything to not have to admit he's wrong
[1:54:48] mujarshad: twitch chat discussion BrokeBack
[1:54:54] michaelsund: FCreep Baldgiven subs
[1:55:02] Jax_6_gunblades: we are having a discussion?
[1:55:04] mujarshad: holy moly
[1:55:16] mujarshad: WE going nuts with the draft
[1:55:24] WhoKnowsUA: @PreacherCasts i dare u to start conversation with that guy, believe me u don't want that
[1:55:33] BerenCy: still a better discussion than na vs eu SeemsGood
[1:55:33] jungchaeyeon01: zac open DansGame
[1:55:52] mcrdisco: @preachercasts he's angry because he called me a retard with out knowing how numbers work
[1:56:00] mujarshad: @BerenCy true, carry on twitch chat
[1:56:08] PreacherCasts: @RiotPulse I'm tagging out. I'm done with this discussion. HAAAAAAAAAAALP
[1:56:08] Jax_6_gunblades: the z mistake but only with zac now cause zed is shiet

[1:56:13] kPrymari: LPL Drinking Game: Take a shot everytime the broadcast shows the word JEEP. 4Head
[1:56:36] mujarshad: you want people to die?
[1:56:40] mcrdisco: @kprymari inb4 alcohol poisoning
[1:57:14] Jax_6_gunblades: can we have a dunk competition like the nba in lpl
[1:57:30] mcrdisco: @berency that's because everyone knows na>eu
[1:57:35] FishRoeSoup: okay now we all know is corki adc or not right CoolStoryBob
[1:57:41] mujarshad: nb coach looks so disgusted 4Head
[1:57:45] Jax_6_gunblades: nope
[1:58:13] PulseIRL: @PreacherCasts sorry can't hear you KappaRoss
[1:58:24] Nadro: LMQ botlane reunited PogChamp
[1:58:35] mujarshad: no karma mid plz BlessRNG
[1:58:35] Jax_6_gunblades: then can you at least read pulse?
[1:59:02] dragonboy122: lwx is better
[1:59:14] PulseIRL: I don't see what I'm eating for dinner has to do with this, Jax
[1:59:23] mujarshad: wait, so is corki adc oor not? Keepo
[1:59:31] mcrdisco: @mujarshad no
[1:59:39] PulseIRL: yes but also no
[1:59:55] michaelsund: He's def not an attack damage carry
[2:00:02] mujarshad: i'm just kidding, i don't care EleGiggle
[2:00:10] jungchaeyeon01: he is assassin Kappa
[2:00:38] mcrdisco: @jungchaeyeon01 an assASSin
[2:00:53] michaelsund: @jungchaeyeon01 when Triforce IE Corki 2 shots LB you start wondering 🤔
[2:00:55] mujarshad: quite a few rumble got assassinated by corki last week 4Head
[2:01:30] Jax_6_gunblades: pulse btw Κappa
[2:01:35] jungchaeyeon01: @scarraface 🤔
[2:01:52] WhoKnowsUA: So glad Vasilii start playing again. Was a big fun of him when he was on LMQ. I hope he just have no mental issues now
[2:01:55] Jax_6_gunblades: yea im wondering why lb is feeding again
[2:02:11] PreacherCasts: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand then Zac just uses Q anyways BibleThump
[2:02:13] FishRoeSoup: “Attack Damage Carry, meaning a champion that usually has low health but deals a lot of damage from auto attacks, or attack damage.”
[2:02:22] FishRoeSoup: “Ability Power Carry, meaning a champion that doesn't have much base health but deals lots of magic damage through spells/abilities.”
[2:02:32] FishRoeSoup: so what corki is CoolStoryBob
[2:02:35] michaelsund: Corki does both
[2:02:40] michaelsund: 4Head
[2:02:49] mcrdisco: @fishroesoup AP marksman
[2:03:14] Jax_6_gunblades: magic dmg marksman
[2:03:25] Jax_6_gunblades: aka a lier
[2:03:36] 420juicelord69: AP marksman or AD caster
[2:03:43] 420juicelord69: whichever you prefer to say
[2:03:45] WhoKnowsUA: @FishRoeSoup it's really ieasy to resolve. When he's building AD items like IE triforce and botrk + aa Alot it's ADC playstyle. so he's ADC mid or bot no matter. WHen he's building AP items like rabadon luden and just poke with R + Q and then ALL in without using AA much he's and AP mage corki
[2:03:48] mcrdisco: @jax_6_gunblades MD marksman is an acceptable answer
[2:03:50] j26martin: NA E
[2:03:54] michaelsund: VASILI PogChamp
[2:03:58] mujarshad: Mor is a beast wtf
[2:04:04] 抗吧凌风: boosted gragas
[2:04:14] PreacherCasts: Nice catch Raz KappaPride
[2:04:22] Jax_6_gunblades: thanks
[2:04:30] mcrdisco: why is varus picked over ashe?
[2:04:50] Jax_6_gunblades: varus is edgier
[2:05:12] Jax_6_gunblades: also chat is kinda ded for 900 viewers
[2:05:21] michaelsund: BrokeBack
[2:05:37] 420juicelord69: varus works better with the new adc build style i think
[2:05:54] michaelsund: ThunBeast
[2:06:02] Gunerdrag: TriHard /

[2:06:15] Jax_6_gunblades: FrankerΖ
[2:06:29] Namigod: did he just
[2:06:31] mcrdisco: @jamesdd2147 nah, at least from what I've seen in na. ashe and Jihn do.good with energy items
[2:06:33] michaelsund: SriHead
[2:06:39] WhoKnowsUA: @Kyle__twitch yes he's annoying to play mid, but he's fine to deal in bot since it's 2 v 2 and easy to deal with any oppressive laner overall
[2:06:44] mcrdisco: go great*
[2:06:57] 布魯斯犬太: BrokeBack
[2:07:04] Itakura_StuGIII: oh, this is a much better comp from newbee
[2:07:13] RustyTheCaster: they have Zac >_>
[2:07:14] WhoKnowsUA: @Kyle__twitch remove his package and make him viable bot again so he become decent botlaner again > easy solution
[2:07:28] Namigod: RustyChamp
[2:07:30] Jax_6_gunblades: thanks rusty i never noticed
[2:07:42] RustyTheCaster: no worries 6 gunblade zac
[2:07:46] Itakura_StuGIII: LUL
[2:07:51] RustyTheCaster: jax* ;)
[2:07:54] PreacherCasts: @RUSTYTheCASTER From one Zac(k) to another, how strong is he at the moment?
[2:07:54] rofflepie: lpl will win rift rivals, mvp sucks now so omg wins, edg beats ssg with macro, kt will lose to rng cause lpl knows how to camp mata and deft, and xiaohu beats pawn, skt will fall to Taiwanese beef noodles
[2:07:58] lzhm: vasilii nice
[2:08:02] michaelsund: Rapidfire + IE + Triforce too stronk
[2:08:04] Jax_6_gunblades: ; )
[2:08:04] RustyTheCaster: broken.
[2:08:14] PreacherCasts: Solid analysis
[2:08:14] mcrdisco: @rustythecaster they're going 6 gunblade zac?
[2:08:30] MalPatrick: rofflepie has smoked a bit too much of that good shit tonight
[2:08:33] 420juicelord69: @mcrdisco well he probs went varus cause it's better range for the cait lane
[2:08:44] WhoKnowsUA: @Kyle__twitch he's been playing mid only bcs of the package, he was always stong botlaner and stong midgame ADC who can wreck havock at 16 min after finishing triforce while your cait is still sitting on pieces of zeal/IE
[2:08:51] mcrdisco: @jamesdd2147 That could.be
[2:08:58] mcrdisco: could be*
[2:09:06] RustyTheCaster: he is Varus for good engage!
[2:09:26] mcrdisco: @rustythecaster isn't ashe good for engage?
[2:09:37] 420juicelord69: @mcrdisco regrup still stuck on corki
[2:09:38] RustyTheCaster: Corki is actually a mid laner not because of the Package. Its because he scales so well with levels
[2:09:39] PreacherCasts: Varus deals with Cait lane better
[2:10:00] 420juicelord69: @mcrdisco resident sle
[2:10:04] mcrdisco: @rustythecaster explain why you'd pick varus over ashe as your bot lane carry
[2:10:06] RustyTheCaster: Varus has harder to work around engage, Ashe is super obvious and Varus also has the E shred/tank shred in kit
[2:10:10] jungchaeyeon01: varus has good waveclear than ashe
[2:10:15] KappaFrankerZXD: lol mystic could have killed
[2:10:20] RustyTheCaster: so he can build crit and still shred tanks with w
[2:10:22] KappaFrankerZXD: or forced both sums
[2:10:23] mcrdisco: @rustythecaster thnx
[2:10:29] FishRoeSoup: @RUSTYTheCASTER chat spent the last hour to discuss if corki is adc or not, what r ur thoughts on this Kappa
[2:10:36] WhoKnowsUA: @Kyle__twitch u don't want to rush into backline with that package as ADC u had to play safe so package is basically a waste in bot especially after laning phase is over, so using him mid fits much more unless they remove package or rework into something bot fitting
[2:10:38] KappaFrankerZXD: xiye*
[2:10:44] Jax_6_gunblades: fish why you do this
[2:10:47] michaelsund: LPL should send Dan
[2:10:52] PreacherCasts: Don't get baited Rusty. You'll never see the end of this
[2:10:59] michaelsund: LUL
[2:11:05] mujarshad: speak french to me dom Kreygasm
[2:11:14] RustyTheCaster: I can very easily press the cross in the top left ;)
[2:11:14] chokepanda: NB PogChamp
[2:11:25] RustyTheCaster: or right idk im on my phone its just a button
[2:11:30] michaelsund: Nice reference LUL
[2:11:32] Jax_6_gunblades: you on a mac?
[2:11:33] rofflepie: Dan is worse than every lpl team going to rift rivals
[2:11:36] mcrdisco: @kyle__twitch he thinks corki is an adc
[2:12:11] Jax_6_gunblades: but can tsm beat the 96 bulls
[2:12:18] rofflepie: get back to me at end of the season
[2:12:21] mcrdisco: @thunbeast_thething is any region?
[2:12:25] rofflepie: and see where dan ends up
[2:12:26] Itakura_StuGIII: @ThunBeast_TheThing the teams that are going, performed best in spring split
[2:12:29] WhoKnowsUA: @RUSTYTheCASTER package is the main reason he's been playing mid exclusively. He's an old champ and he's been playing mid since his release but not that much and not only mid. But package is the main gateway why he's not botlaner anymore and not a flex pick AT ALL
[2:12:44] RustyTheCaster: ok regrup if thats what you think
[2:12:49] Itakura_StuGIII: thats because the standings in LCK havent changed much from spring split
[2:12:50] RustyTheCaster: :)
[2:13:01] jungchaeyeon01: @thunbeast_thething u forgot MVP 4Head
[2:13:04] PreacherCasts: OOOOOOOOOoooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:13:08] michaelsund: MVP best team Kreygasm
[2:13:09] rofflepie: also little deft is coming in for edg very soon
[2:13:09] chokepanda: cuz best teams never beat these teams. Thats funny LUL
[2:13:31] PulseIRL: If you gave Cait the package in addition to her kit she wouldn't stop being an adc
[2:13:49] RustyTheCaster: dont do it pulse he's too steadfast
[2:13:52] Jax_6_gunblades: pls no rule34 pulse
[2:13:56] mujarshad: wtf swift plz
[2:14:00] Dagobert2424: cait is female she cant have a package LUL
[2:14:02] PulseIRL: Cait with the package Kreygasm
[2:14:08] michaelsund: WutFace
[2:14:12] mcrdisco: hahaha
[2:14:15] WhoKnowsUA: @RUSTYTheCASTER i mean look at his pick history at worls he's been top pick there before his package rework like all the time, and he's not being picked bot at all in pro games
[2:14:16] Itakura_StuGIII: @Dagobert2424 you can still give her a package LUL
[2:14:19] PreacherCasts: Cait with the package PulseChamp
[2:14:20] Namigod: kkoma cait top Kreygasm
[2:14:21] FishRoeSoup: CS LUL
[2:14:22] BerenCy: Temmo with the package Kreygasm
[2:14:22] PulseIRL: @Dagobert2424 You clearly haven't been that deep in the internet Kappa
[2:14:24] mujarshad: cait show me your your package Kreygasm
[2:14:37] RustyTheCaster: hi regrup, did you know that when they reworked corki, the package wasnt the only shift?
[2:14:43] RustyTheCaster: ;O
[2:14:48] michaelsund: RuleFive WutFace
[2:14:56] PreacherCasts: OOOOOOOOOoooooooo0000000000
[2:14:57] PulseIRL: ;O
[2:15:06] PreacherCasts: Kaind
[2:15:10] mcrdisco: FailFish @regrup
[2:15:30] 420juicelord69: wait who is rusty?
[2:15:31] PreacherCasts: @Regrup TFW you're arguing with someone who's known as a smart person
[2:15:35] WhoKnowsUA: @RiotPulse if u can't use package as Cait in bot she won't be picked bot after that bcs u basically can't release her full potential. So if with package she'll be fitting mid much better she will be picked bot lesser lol
[2:15:41] Dagobert2424: NotLikeThis
[2:15:41] 420juicelord69: i feel like he's someone legit
[2:15:54] Namigod: KappaPride
[2:15:56] RustyTheCaster: did you know he scales well with items and levels where most adcs scale with items mostly? ;O
[2:15:59] PulseIRL: Hey Rusty, did I leave my moisturizer on the makeup table? It's purple ish

[2:17:12] Jax_6_gunblades: doublelift
[2:17:17] mujarshad: corki Keepo
[2:17:18] rofflepie: corki was played mid ever since season 2, its not a completely new thing
[2:17:30] RustyTheCaster: did you know - I was a pro player? ;^)
[2:17:30] rofflepie: watch clg eu vs clg na gamea
[2:17:30] PreacherCasts: @RiotPulse I concede
[2:17:36] FishRoeSoup: ur not decent in league unless c1 2000 lp Keepo
[2:17:36] RustyTheCaster: try again regrup
[2:17:39] WhoKnowsUA: @RUSTYTheCASTER ofc i know, but did u know he still builds AD items just like regular ADC while dealing 80% of magic damage?
[2:18:00] mcrdisco: @regrup You just learned that
[2:18:05] BerenCy: 10 hours later, corki is still analysed
[2:18:07] WhoKnowsUA: @RUSTYTheCASTER remove his package and buff him in bot and u'll see what happen
[2:18:10] PulseIRL: ok fine I'm asking Raz when he's off the Desk, he doesn't give me sass PunOko
[2:18:10] mujarshad: how did that work wtf
[2:18:10] cantspeel: Corki is an adc

[2:18:29] tttacit: NA TP
[2:18:30] mcrdisco: @regrup legit the whole chat had to tell you that
[2:18:34] RustyTheCaster: can we all agree that Corki has a massive package?
[2:18:34] PulseIRL: cantspeel with the oil delivery to the bonfire Kappa
[2:18:42] cantspeel: what can i say
[2:18:44] RustyTheCaster: massive
[2:18:45] Jax_6_gunblades: no
[2:18:47] mujarshad: @RUSTYTheCASTER only at the start Kappa
[2:18:48] cantspeel: i like a good fire
[2:18:51] mcrdisco: @cantspeel you're wrong he's an AP marksman
[2:18:52] PreacherCasts: Huge
[2:18:59] mcrdisco: mage marksman*
[2:19:00] WhoKnowsUA: @RUSTYTheCASTER Ezreal have similar playstyle but he's been playing botlane and was in meta until this time while corki wasn't
[2:19:04] PreacherCasts: Gigantic package fire all over Twitch Chat KappaPride
[2:19:19] RustyTheCaster: did you know when they buffed itemisation Ezreal moved to mid?
[2:19:23] cantspeel: @mcrdisco sure he does magic dmg, but he doesnt have ap does he?
[2:19:23] RustyTheCaster: ;O
[2:19:23] PulseIRL: Corki is a hybrid attack damage ability power marksman caster mid bot laner champion
[2:19:28] cantspeel: hwo can yo ube an ap carry without being ap
[2:19:31] Dagobert2424: Corki deals 80% magic dmg is also why he is played mid because then you have still mixed dmg
[2:19:33] cantspeel: makes 0 sense
[2:19:34] rofflepie: the main reason that corki bot stopped being a thing (this was pre package) is the change to q, delayed skill shot is fine for wavwclear mid but its not good for fighting, so corki bot loses all the actual fights bot
[2:19:48] mcrdisco: @cantspeel he does though?
[2:19:48] PulseIRL: or hadapmcmblc for short Kappa
[2:19:49] WhoKnowsUA: @RUSTYTheCASTER i mean Forgiven for example love corki but he won't pick it for the same reason bcs he's bad in bot and package isn't fit him in bot at all
[2:19:49] itsyehey: @ScarraFace Im spanish xD
[2:19:58] rodricide: Kled OTP playing shen LUL
[2:20:01] cantspeel: AP isnt a damage type @mcrdisco come on man youre better than this
[2:20:19] cantspeel: physical dmg, magic dmg breh
[2:20:23] Jax_6_gunblades: but corki was still played bot even after his q got changed from instant to a delayed one
[2:20:24] mcrdisco: @cantspeel that's why I changed it to magic marksman
[2:20:34] RustyTheCaster: ok
[2:20:35] FishRoeSoup: put it up again "Attack Damage Carry, meaning a champion that usually has low health but deals a lot of damage from auto attacks, OR attack damage."
[2:20:39] cantspeel: you didnt
[2:20:41] michaelsund: @itsyehey i never studied spanish and i understand 80% as italian MingLee
[2:20:41] Osteoid: Don't lose with Zac NotLikeThis
[2:20:44] cantspeel: you said ap marksman
[2:20:48] cantspeel: come on man stahp
[2:20:56] rofflepie: ap still mattered cause corki still had ap scaling, so tri fprce was better on corki than pure ad ppl
[2:21:02] RustyTheCaster: so correct me if im wrong, forgiven doesnt play it bot because it's bad bottom
[2:21:09] RustyTheCaster: I'm shocked
[2:21:13] mcrdisco: then with our @ you o said magic marksman under it
[2:21:28] cantspeel: ill get on board with magic marksman

[2:22:11] RustyTheCaster: but im just up to snuff
[2:22:22] RustyTheCaster: well up to snuff corki, youre a wizard
[2:22:22] PulseIRL: But do you have an ace machine? KappaRoss
[2:22:25] 420juicelord69: @regrup Corki is a champion historically who gained notoriety thanks to his package. It's yuuge. Also he deals magic damage but since you can build AP and still deal magic damage he is an adc. Great logic buddy
[2:22:32] goblinguy01: Chances NewBee beats World Elite?
[2:22:35] mcrdisco: @riotpulse you're wrong magic marksman is manly
[2:22:35] michaelsund: @Kyle__twitch also remember the times he wouldn't play Kalista because he hated the champ 4Head
[2:22:41] chokepanda: ????
[2:22:42] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie that's bcs he have double scalings on 3 of 4 his abilities the same as Ezreal

[2:23:09] goblinguy01: Wait. Zac wasn't banned?
[2:23:12] Itakura_StuGIII: @ScarraFace it wasnt cuz he hated the champ, it's cuz he didnt feel like it was worth spending all that time to learn her since she'd get nerfed soon anywya, which she was
[2:23:18] WhoKnowsUA: @jamesdd2147 im not even talked to u, what's your point lol

[3:57:35] Caeddavik: c9 can't draft for shit, did you see them give reksai every game and orianna
[3:57:49] Caeddavik: if c9 can fix their shitty draft then maybe
[3:57:51] velocegravity: he looses lane all the time but gets so much help by xmithie
[3:58:15] velocegravity: xmithie makes flame look good
[3:58:25] FishRoeSoup: meiko so thin Kappa
[3:58:35] FishRoeSoup: meiko chopsticks Kappa
[3:59:45] nerobotas: Btw the most powerfull mid/jungle comp is reksai+orianna
[4:00:06] rofflepie: rush to tsm, thier only chance to make it out of groups at worlds
[4:00:08] nerobotas: what clown 9 did in gmae 2 yesterday with reksai+oriana should be a lesson
[4:00:29] Caeddavik: i miss Rush BibleThump
[4:00:41] rofflepie: c9 has no spots
[4:00:43] FishRoeSoup: fun fact: the only time tsm out of groups they played with amazing Kappa
[4:00:48] rofflepie: tsm has a spot
[4:00:57] catjammerl: MingLee
[4:01:39] rofflepie: he streamed in english all day till april ish
[4:01:48] rofflepie: wasnt that long ago
[4:02:10] rofflepie: his english however is full of memetalk though, cause he learned english from sneaky and c9
[4:03:10] rofflepie: c9 need to get a native top laner somehow
[4:04:51] velocegravity: ssumday would have to carry bjerg
[4:05:07] 南雨: Good team >> good player. Fact
[4:05:52] Caeddavik: idk, tsm has had the same players for over a year, and they haven't improved all that much
[4:05:55] velocegravity: if they keep sven they wouldnt
[4:05:57] rofflepie: tsm with ssumday can play skt style of games all day, skt's strongest comp is their 4-1 push pull comp, strong top laner split push, their 4 good enough to hold against other team and rotate all over their base
[4:06:10] Caeddavik: personally i think their coaching is the problem on tsm
[4:06:33] Caeddavik: they always play meta picks, no variation whatsoever
[4:07:11] velocegravity: he actually loves na so why hes poor
[4:07:14] rofflepie: i dont even know if skt would want ssumday tbh

[4:08:26] eat_a__snickers: where is uzi ResidentSlseper
[4:08:26] rofflepie: kt can beat skt if they replace deft
[4:08:53] rofflepie: kt wins early pretty mcuh every time against skt now, but their team fight is really bad atm
[4:09:00] velocegravity: wuxx > y4
[4:09:08] rofflepie: mainly cause deft is playing very poorly
[4:09:18] decco41: fuck koreans
[4:09:32] 1MrFahrenheit: @RiotPulse your and idiot OpieOP
[4:09:39] eat_a__snickers: imp would b better than deft on kt

[4:10:19] PulseIRL: @1MrFahrenheit KappaRoss
[4:10:27] rofflepie: last bo3 score played good game 1, but game 2 and 3 he didnt play that good, he got a early lead with 4 kills but he fed like hell mid game
[4:10:46] eat_a__snickers: SKT prob still win no matter what because Faker is too good and their teamplay is better
[4:11:13] velocegravity: Faker too good wtf? faker is the worst on skt
[4:11:22] weiger666: WutFace
[4:11:23] rofflepie: no, kr is not that weak, if deft didnt get killed at skt red buff, kt prob wins that series 2-0
[4:11:33] eat_a__snickers: ya man fakers the worst haHAA
[4:11:45] velocegravity: people think Faker is still the best
[4:11:48] 1MrFahrenheit: @RiotPulse VaultBoy
[4:12:18] eat_a__snickers: imp > deft
[4:12:39] rofflepie: funny deft use to be bad in lane but god in team fight, he is the opposite now
[4:13:05] velocegravity: like 2 years ago faker died to 1/10 ganks now 9/10
[4:13:35] rofflepie: cause benji would ward for non 24/7, and peanut is the lowest warding jungle in all of lck
[4:13:39] 南雨: Skt will win world is because they are good team not only because
[4:13:41] rofflepie: bengi*
[4:13:43] xniverz: @cmelvard Uzi is better
[4:13:44] velocegravity: he does carry almost never and doesnt win lane impressive
[4:13:54] 南雨: faker
[4:14:15] velocegravity: skt would win with any good mid too if he would have the same synergy with the team
[4:14:26] eat_a__snickers: Imp always been better than deft throughout his career LUL
[4:14:40] eat_a__snickers: now deft plays with mata and still not performing EleGiggle

[4:18:10] velocegravity: i dont say faker is bad i just say hes not the best
[4:18:12] WhoKnowsUA: @ThunBeast_TheThing don't forget that since last 2 years jungle have been buffed several times, so it's harder and harder to actualyl avoid ganks or stay alive

[4:20:30] DalFifa: you think Edward will come back this game?

[4:20:48] emeraldadc_vayne: uzi retired?
[4:20:56] velocegravity: Faker fangays watch just followning a hype that was beforevthey started playing league
[4:21:32] uzimatalol: I think skt is in a position now where it's not the faker show anymore. They have a solid team that all help towards the carry. It's about that top lane and jungle now for them faker is the last resort if shit falls.
[4:21:42] mujarshad: fiora just scaling top NotLikeThis
[4:21:45] velocegravity: @itzolgon_mvgame i dunno maybe he is but that doesnt make him 10x better than any other player
