[0:30:07] captainkrajick: I think LCK is not strong enough to put GEN 1st, because the region is weak. But I think GENG is good team

[0:31:13] elogia_: Fpx
[0:31:22] 띠로링닝: JDG , GENG << my choice
[0:31:29] captainkrajick: @DamwonKia_Edrick yes but they haven't performed well internationally outside of Ruler right?
[0:31:36] ShirleySzM: @captainkrajick pretty fair. Gen G is definitely pretty good but the 4th seed of LCK (seems like LSB or DK) are no where near the 4th of LPL (RNG/V5)
[0:31:42] randomasiandudeoverhere: TSM to win everything
[0:31:43] 파도666: Omg is dominant in the regular season but fpx is worth it if it hits a high point.
[0:31:44] sebastiana1: T1 top1   geng top2

[0:33:34] darioj21: @水原千鶴的老公 True, the LPL is very stacked with ADCs
[0:33:42] Ochibana_ame: LPL has had the most rigorous competitive format for years, as of now. Maybe a team or two from LCK or LEC, but I don't think any region can fully compete with LPL's top teams.

[1:57:42] invertedcrayon: @epiphanic101 and your criteria for gwen being broken is "1v9 and damage" as you said. I'm using the entire game as a reference as to why Sylas and Wukong are stronger picks.
