[1:03:58] 6000j: TES worlds skins would probably look neat
[1:03:59] AuxCasts: @Cinskiy yes, RNG and V5 can still make worlds and are locked into Regionals (RNG can still potentially take 2nd seed on championship points)

[1:05:37] AuxCasts: @litwos28 depending on where they are seeded into it they'll either need to win 1 Bo5 or win 2 Bo5's to make worlds. There will be 4 teams in regionals and 2 spots available
[1:05:41] theeelegendhimself: wayward so clean
[1:05:46] blablub812: @lavier761 cause china pays a lot better, simple as that
[1:05:46] DkAgent: @420puffgod nope but need to win Regional Finals for 3rd or 4th seed
[1:05:48] OhBaiMark: why's he dressed like the terminator?
[1:05:48] lavier761: @dota_is_boring If LCK that perfect, why KR players choose to win for LPL ? EleGiggle
[1:05:50] MogdarPhoenix: @ROIDRAGE9999 ? And then they won against them and got to the finals (and they lost, but they offered a good challenge). No one team remains always undefeated, the important thing is winning more than you lose.
