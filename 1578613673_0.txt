[2:33:48] jjenningswithanE: @myprecioussosnowy but that's EXACTLY what I'm saying:  it's STILL situational.  and when those requirements can't be fulfilled, TES don't have a backup plan in that moment.  so, get some RELIABLE engage so you can be more flexible in the heat of the moment, even if you fall behind.
