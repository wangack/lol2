[6:39:11] finale_lol: Come on guys, we all know that Isurus will win Worlds
[6:39:14] donotbefail: @thedragonkpop G2 can't even win vs struggling T1 xD
[6:39:19] bluesclues96: @TheOreoCupcake yeah he'd probably say something like "RNG begged riot to let them play at MSI and they still lost"
[6:39:39] donotbefail: @donotbefail for sure bro for sure Kappa Kappa
[6:39:40] TheOreoCupcake: @bluesclues96 We can't deal with their delusional takes PepeLaugh

[6:40:11] jetlagging1: @ziosevielspezel sanest comment today
[6:40:12] TheOreoCupcake: @ziosevielspezel Based Take. This is fair.
[6:40:16] Áéõ‰∏ΩËé≤ÂÜ†Ë•ø: 50CNY ALE
[6:40:20] OGBryan0202: @myprecioussosnowy i mean, LPL wanted to skip MSI if they had to go LAN, thats why RIOT had them play online, i think you are the one with comprehension issues when I'm not even a T1 bias, the reason i typed out whatever you are quoting is to people shitting on the ping issue
[6:40:22] ViingadoR: i remember last year 4 LCK teams in quarters last year
[6:40:22] thedragonkpop: @cesnaya gano RNG 3-2
[6:40:24] BLGWorlds2024: TRUE TRUE TRUE
[6:40:30] Luffy10941: @Luffy10941 yea it's possible but not sure if that will happen
[6:40:36] bluesclues96: @Luffy10941 yeah if they get lucky with the draws or if all of them get 1st seed in their group
[6:40:36] wg200234: Last year, all lck team in quarter
[6:40:40] SoulSnorlax: YUUMI
[6:40:40] shaonian1522: LPL ÔºûPCS agreeÔºü
[6:40:47] ceznaya: @thedragonkpop gracias
[6:40:50] TheOreoCupcake: @Luffy10941 @M012345678 LCK and LPL make it out of all their groups. LPL 1 & LCK 2 or vice-versa repeats for the groups and we get that.
[6:40:51] ViingadoR: 3 LCK teams semis 1 LPL LCK > LPL
[6:40:52] italianpriest00: @ziosevielspezel TRUE
[6:40:54] Purby: riot loves yuumi KEKW
[6:40:56] ghosthiena: quem ganhou?
[6:40:57] ziosevielspezel: @TheOreoCupcake  hopefully atleast 3 lpl teams make out of groups im scared of b01
[6:40:57] OGBryan0202: @myprecioussosnowy thats why they were allowed to play online though, MSI dont give them ticket to worlds, summer LPL does
[6:41:04] thedragonkpop: @shaonian1522 agreed
[6:41:05] untimelyten: @Luffy10941 If rng get out of play ins and oretty sure they don't put 2 teams from the same region so if all lpl teams make top 2 in groups
[6:41:06] remy_therat99: kekla
[6:41:14] Brento95: KEKW
[6:41:20] andy_juran: lng so close, i hate you ALE
[6:41:21] jetlagging1: @Luffy10941 4 LPL and 4 LCK teams in quarter = ratings tanked outside Asia kekw
[6:41:25] likeredred: LECÔºûALL
[6:41:30] fazed343: @shaonian1522 i mean pcs has FLying Oyster PepeLaugh
[6:41:30] sephiroxical19981202: I remember when semis are 2 EU and 1 NA team, as if that matters
[6:41:33] BLGWorlds2024: And lost to EDG. LCK KEWK KEWK KEWK KEWK KEWK
[6:41:37] TheOreoCupcake: @ziosevielspezel For LCK and LPL, they are at a disadvantage cuz regular season is BO3.
[6:41:51] graythroat: LEC AND LCS IN WORLDS EleGiggle
[6:42:01] gutojoatssi10: Chovy>>>>>>>Faker>>doinb gg

[6:42:04] tolistx: HATE  ALE too ÔºåIM  bolling
[6:42:06] Luffy10941: @Luffy10941 pretty sure if lpl and lck get out of play ins each group will have an lck and an lpl team just like last year monkaW
[6:42:15] ziosevielspezel: @TheOreoCupcake  for lpl its true but lck almost always makes it out only 2 teams have failed to make it out for lck
[6:42:23] Ïï†Ï¶àÌéåÏù¥ÏµúÍ≥†Ïïº: absolutely so excited
[6:42:27] thedragonkpop: Worlds in NA will be fun to watch
[6:42:31] donotbefail: @Luffy10941 Not gonna happend, LCK top 4 is way weaker than top 4 LPL. I can see 4 LPL and 3 LCK go next stage and maybe 1 EU team
[6:42:35] graythroat: LEC GETTING 4 SLOTS EleGiggle
[6:42:35] zen0476: NA KEKW

[6:42:49] OGBryan0202: LPL vs LCK gonna be so good at Worlds
[6:42:53] myprecioussosnowy: @ogbryan0202 honestly, it was a very crappy situation, and whichever team that lose the tournament would constantly blame the ping, which we see in real time right now
[6:42:54] rottung55: So sad ale,bin>>>breathe pls losing hard in world
[6:42:59] rombawan: TACOS Pog
[6:43:02] jetlagging1: @Luffy10941 It's not even NA anyway.  If TL beats EG it's 1 NA out of 15 players  from LCS
[6:43:04] graythroat: EU AND NA IN WORLDS EleGiggle
[6:43:10] TheOreoCupcake: @ziosevielspezel It's good for JDG and TES cuz they don't care about fighting. It's terrible for EDG and RNG KEKW
[6:43:16] ziosevielspezel: we were one game away from 2 na teams making it out of groups and 0 from eu last year

[6:44:10] OGBryan0202: @myprecioussosnowy yea, thats damn true, just not the teams fault, the schedules and quarantine measures screwed MSI up. Will be much better if all teams are available for LAN
