[4:55:20] janna___used_q_on_florida: Kreygasm lpl
[4:55:22] TiesAU: meanwhile at LPL casting HQ, they have barred the doors while Benji tried to barge in yelling "THIS IS MY CHANCE!" and a sickly pulse is lying against the base of the doors saying "I CAN'T HOLD HIM FOREVER"

[4:57:35] RustyTheCaster: I'd say Spawn is diamond but he has tilted down to plat
[4:57:36] mujarshad: yeah he's been abusing cinderhulk jglers
[4:57:42] FishRoeSoup: plat's game knowledge is simply insufficient for casters
[4:57:43] TiesAU: Krepo was around master. *pours one out for Krepo*
[4:57:49] definitely_Diana: most color casters are usually pretty high ELO (plat-diamond), PbP's vary from silver (Pastry) to diamond (Pulse)
[4:57:50] isentux1: I just think having silvers as casters is bad
[4:58:04] definitely_Diana: I don't think there's a single bronze caster

[5:03:49] definitely_Diana: @Liudotwenson6969 best I can think is to stream audio only on twitch with your headset through a VPN, on your phone, if possible, but we'll be on a delay from live
[5:04:17] definitely_Diana: @pogchampignonlol I'm unfamiliar with the internet infrastructure in china and korea, idk, :-(
[5:04:43] Asukara13: @asadkid VPN helps a lot

[5:46:47] Escapee1: raz has really improved
[5:46:56] merthins: Dan's botlane and jgl are really underwhelming. I'd rather want the feeding Kennen who suicides for mass dmg then that conservative play that gets you nowhere.
[5:47:59] Trip2sky: who wonnerd?
[5:48:07] sasinuka: @merthins apply to play adc for LGD

[6:09:26] notdoctorq: BrainSlug
[6:09:49] definitely_Diana: Frosko is PbP now?
[6:10:02] nameless_typhlosion: they swap off @domroemer
[6:10:13] nameless_typhlosion: pretty sure anyway
[6:10:16] Aenerius: @domroemer some casters are not defined by such "titles", they transcend the limitations others place upon themselves
[6:10:22] Aenerius: Kappa
[6:10:35] definitely_Diana: Keepo
[6:10:41] nameless_typhlosion: KappaHD
[6:10:54] notdoctorq: qtp1 tobias2
[6:11:03] Aenerius: Ok folks, Moyu is playing, place your bets on the amount of deaths he'll have. Our last game was 12 I believe
[6:11:10] Ihatemyself23: Frosk is great I think
[6:11:22] Aenerius: Minimum bet is 1 Kappa
[6:11:22] 삼도천심해어: DansGaming
[6:11:27] Ihatemyself23: Chat usually talks shit because grill but I think she does a great job
[6:11:35] MeAladel: OSBlob
[6:11:41] MeAladel: OSblob
[6:11:56] Aenerius: @Ihatemyself23 she's underrated due to internet stereotypes :/
[6:12:01] Ihatemyself23: At least she knows the game unlike sjokz who is just pretty face retard when it comes to game
[6:12:22] Aenerius: Hmm Sjokz will never say she has the knowledge, she is more like an esports journalist
[6:12:48] notdoctorq: KonCha weebers wall
[6:12:53] Aenerius: Got to say Dash has been doing an outstanding job as desk host though
[6:13:05] Ihatemyself23: Yeah but everyone is all Sjokz Jebaited but Frosk actually has the knowledge
[6:13:18] Jiqonix: sjokz is a host...
[6:13:18] Ihatemyself23: Honestly getting a hot chick to do post game interviews is shitty
[6:13:28] Ihatemyself23: Bring back Deman and Joe!
[6:13:35] Aenerius: Her questions are pretty spot on though to bring out flair and drama
[6:13:45] mujarshad: rip top
[6:13:47] Aenerius: Because unlike what people might say, we all do enjoy a tad of the dramatic in our esports
[6:13:58] Aenerius: The trash talking and rivalries and such
[6:14:14] merthins: Moyu seems like the Dyrus of the LPL second game in a row
[6:14:42] 布魯斯犬太: GG
[6:14:43] Aenerius: They could try to use the Darien strategy? Moyu dies top, get advantage elsewhere?
[6:15:39] Aenerius: O_o
[6:15:52] definitely_Diana: this game
[6:15:54] definitely_Diana: is Kappa
[6:15:55] Aenerius: Am I the only one having a hard time keeping up who is actually winning the fight?
[6:16:00] Ihatemyself23: Hat was a crazy fight
[6:16:02] FishRoeSoup: KOG PASSIVE SOUND LUL
[6:16:05] Rudiko: NotLikeThis
[6:16:14] Ihatemyself23: Wp by the gragas
[6:16:22] Ihatemyself23: Turned it
[6:16:50] Aenerius: Eimy going in for the steal?
[6:16:55] Aenerius: Nope
[6:17:39] AUMamba: U know what LGD jg have a nickname in China king of jungle
[6:17:45] chhopsky: FALCON PUNCH
[6:17:48] Ihatemyself23: Does anyone know what Monte does now?
[6:17:48] Aenerius: Monte's casting this would consist of a wide variety of sighs and half sentences
[6:18:04] Aenerius: @Ihatemyself23 He casts Overwatch and Hearthstone I believe
[6:18:05] Jiqonix: just the tip Kreygasm
[6:18:16] Aenerius: Overwatch is doing well considering worlds is coming up
[6:18:22] delusionaldemon: just the tip lmao
[6:18:27] Aenerius: The casting line-up seems legit too
[6:18:28] Ihatemyself23: Hmmm thats cool I guess
[6:18:36] keebao: @DarthLaser so shit casting and just
[6:18:40] keebao: sighing.
[6:18:43] sanjurothewise: drack
[6:18:49] mujarshad: mountain drack 4Head
[6:19:07] sanjurothewise: these casters are miles better than low-tier csgo casters who cant pronounce names
[6:19:08] Aenerius: Well, I do like Monte's casting but this would be a bit too much :P and agreed Derpah ^^
[6:20:19] zer088: @darthlaser 1111
[6:20:26] Aenerius: Well Overwatch also has change of pace as a strategy so I believe it would be possible? I don't really watch that often
[6:20:52] Aenerius: It's tough enough keeping track with NA, EU, LCK and LPL (which I barely can) as is o_o
[6:21:24] Cripplespite: no need to watch lpl as a whole just watch EDG , RNG , and WE matches
[6:21:36] sanjurothewise: lol that bard flash
[6:21:50] Aenerius: LUL
[6:21:52] Cripplespite: LGD LUL
[6:22:00] sanjurothewise: ve got a multi on LGD and samsung galaxy, ez
[6:22:02] Avenuee3: tfw LPL have more viewers than EU LIL
[6:22:07] Avenuee3: LUL
[6:22:17] Aenerius: EU starts in 30 minutes
[6:22:21] FishRoeSoup: VaultBoy BEST REGION HAS MORE VIEWERS, PROBLEM? VaultBoy
[6:22:29] delusionaldemon: yeah eu hasn't started
[6:22:32] Cripplespite: honestly EDG, WE, and RNG has the highest chance of going to worlds
[6:22:37] sanjurothewise: nip are gettng smashed
[6:22:37] Cripplespite: for LPL
[6:22:49] notdoctorq: ???????
[6:22:55] Avenuee3: OMG is honestly on the same level as SKT right now PogChamp LUL
[6:23:15] sanjurothewise: that skt samsung game was fuckin nuts
[6:23:26] sanjurothewise: ^
[6:23:27] Aenerius: No interesting match-ups today tho x_x, H2K will crush Roccat and VIT vs NiP is content negligable as the French would say...
[6:23:31] Cripplespite: OMG wud be 4th lol
[6:24:00] Avenuee3: in 2015 EU would have more viewers League dying
[6:24:05] mujarshad: mannn, lgd just has a casual 6k gold lead
[6:24:20] Aenerius: As a European, I find the EU LCS tedious right now for the most part
[6:24:21] Ihatemyself23: Wait a second. Is the renekton building a bork?
[6:24:33] mujarshad: yes
[6:24:36] Aenerius: There is no drive, no wish to be the best. They just want to be ok in EU and keep their spot, no more no less.
[6:24:40] mujarshad: it's good for 1v1
[6:24:57] Aenerius: NA actually is trying a lot harder right now whilst the EU teams just choke on their arrogance and lackluster attitude
[6:25:10] Ihatemyself23: Strange times
[6:25:16] PulseIRL: Froskurinn PBP Kreygasm
