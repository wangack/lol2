[4:12:06] JohnIn3D_: evening @Hackl25
[4:12:10] iamvievie: Peanut was benched right?
[4:12:19] nick_3015: Blank was doing well too. But his win streak was broken :(
[4:12:28] Aenerius: It has happened before, even last season that SKT lose a couple of series because they''re behind on the meta but Kkoma is quick to fix this
[4:12:29] iamvievie: Crown was good that game
[4:12:33] Aenerius: Give it a week or two and they're probably back
[4:12:50] nick_3015: true. If there one Korean midlaner that can match faker its crown
[4:13:02] Aenerius: Well Bdd was said to be the Fakerkiller
[4:13:07] 布魯斯犬太: SHY
[4:13:09] papanalgalorian: crown is a yung faker

[4:13:41] DterrorA: Class is permanent. Crown had like pretty long series where he was performing utterly bad
[4:13:42] nick_3015: Na beat EU and LPL beat KR and LMS
[4:13:48] Wan6Saber: LPL won RR
[4:13:48] leavesinwind: rng
[4:13:53] iamvievie: Yeah Pawn as well

[4:14:40] JohnIn3D_: @scarras_best_friend how does that make you feel?
[4:14:40] DterrorA: Every single member of LZ looks extremely talented(except Gorilla and Pray, we already know their class)
[4:14:48] iamvievie: Yeah but Longzhu is pretty weak
[4:14:56] 布魯斯犬太: UZI PogChamp
[4:15:00] verybiglama: well if we're comparing him to faker, faker was very dominant from the first game he played
[4:15:00] iamvievie: Bdd needs to carry to prove himself
[4:15:04] absolwave: longzhu is like the p1 of this split
[4:15:11] Aenerius: If LZ's organization sticks with these players, they could be contending for worlds next year
[4:15:14] absolwave: like pretty behind the top 2 but still clear top 3
[4:15:18] nick_3015: Either way SKT and SS are going to worlds. Its between KT and LZ to fight for the 3rd spot
[4:15:19] verybiglama: he does have good moments though
[4:15:38] Aenerius: Top 4: SKT, SSG, KT and LZ. Afreeca is a loose cannon that can go either way
[4:16:01] absolwave: jin air 6th place team <3
[4:16:03] Wan6Saber: Afreeca will lose, no doubt in my mind
