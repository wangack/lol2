[2:39:08] FishRoeSoup: @cantspeel where r these songs from? last time i also searched for strangers in the night and there is like literately no public information about it except few sneaky links
[2:39:20] MisakiKureha: Stranger in the night by andy chandler
[2:39:27] cantspeel: they are broadcast songs, so some of them are not easily accessible
[2:39:33] MisakiKureha: it is tricky to find but its one the first pages
[2:39:51] nemostreamo: i can never find the one that goes "well i've been told that you can make a mold"
[2:40:10] nemostreamo: another DnB song
[2:40:25] MisakiKureha: @dubu_dubu Stranger in The Night - YouTube
[2:40:32] Machrus: Silver hair PogChamp
[2:40:47] MisakiKureha: try it this way and in the description it shows its by andy chandler
[2:41:01] nemostreamo: @MisakiKureha it's a different one, not the last one. i might have missed it.
[2:41:01] weakestlink99: Did anyone, back when they were a noob, think Blade of the Ruined King was Blade of the Rune King?
[2:41:02] blackmaamba28: Fagget
[2:41:08] MisakiKureha: oh mb
[2:41:29] TheVern: @weakestlink99 100%
[2:41:32] weakestlink99: Because I did.
[2:43:17] Machrus: cameras on me, better yawn Kappa
[2:43:50] momongah: wait
[2:43:59] momongah: where's goong
[2:44:08] weakestlink99: Blade of the Rune King would be a good item idea, though. Maybe like +135% of rune and mastery effects for, like, 3500 gold.
[2:44:24] FantasticTT: DAN TEAM PogChamp DansGame TEAM
[2:44:43] momongah: SELLOUT
[2:45:33] Machrus: why dont LPL teams put a space between their team name and their actual name, e.g. DANKarin, not DAN Karin
[2:46:14] weakestlink99: @machrus Probably just Tencent Games' preference.
[2:46:29] GummiGrim: It might also let fit longer names
[2:46:48] Machrus: TSMDoublelift
[2:47:35] Machrus: i love LPL's obsession with kog
[2:48:06] Spiidy: DansGame
[2:48:26] Machrus: Fervor Rumble
[2:48:33] weakestlink99: @machrus It's 21-11, why fix what isn't broken?
[2:49:00] MisakiKureha: its was funny when a full build rage blade khalista out dmged a full build kog late TehePelo
[2:49:07] Machrus: @weakestlink99 I respect it! Does trist see play?
[2:49:21] Rudiko: kog 7# winrate lpl tho
[2:49:29] Rudiko: 73%
[2:49:42] weakestlink99: @machrus A little. Not as much as other ADCs.
[2:49:51] RustyTheCaster: LPL Drafts PogChamp
[2:50:19] Machrus: I wanna play more kog but I'm not good enough at farming so I hit like a wet noodle mid game
[2:50:34] Rudiko: use youw to farm lol
[2:50:36] Spiidy: TTours
[2:50:39] weakestlink99: @machrus What rank are you?
[2:50:51] Machrus: @weakestlink99 silver 4
[2:50:54] MisakiKureha: @Machrus dont let your dreams be dreams
[2:52:28] weakestlink99: @machrus That's about average. CSing and Midgame are going to be keys to improve your rank.
[2:52:53] mangohoe2: Just roam -Moe
[2:53:36] mangohoe2: Wait to climb you have to be good at csing?
[2:53:53] 甜野的小迷妹: unless you main support or jungle I guess
[2:54:06] mangohoe2: Im p2 and im shit at CSing :z
[2:54:09] weakestlink99: More CS = More Gold = Bigger Lead = Higher Winrate
[2:54:13] Machrus: @weakestlink99 I'm not that bad at csing in the first ten minutes i average 75-ish and that's usually with a kill and 1-2 backs, but once lane ends I seem to completely fall behind in cs compared to higher elo players.,
[2:55:01] mangohoe2: I average 5.8 CS per minute
[2:55:17] nerobotas: wtf... :D so trash
[2:55:25] zekeovo: LUL that EQ combo
[2:55:31] Im_only_sleeping: SeemsGood
[2:55:33] LDubz78: Ya I have that problem too. The key is to make farming your default and make a conscious effort to keep farming. That doesn't mean to not roam though. You should be farming every second you aren't roaming pretty much
[2:55:37] nerobotas: lvl 3 dive under the turret
[2:55:43] nerobotas: lmao
[2:55:56] LunarWulfiee: avoidless PogChamp
[2:55:57] nerobotas: and u guys want to tell me these guys are pros
[2:55:57] mangohoe2: Silver 4 is high elo anyways LUL
[2:55:57] LDubz78: It's like farm farm farm -> look to roam -> farm farm farm rinse and repeat
[2:56:10] Machrus: @MrKill1234 That's a really good way to think about it, I think I waste a lot of time walking mid, and then walking back when nothing happens
[2:56:12] nerobotas: lvl 6 vs lvl 4
[2:56:36] mangohoe2: If you are mid, push lane and try to clear the raptor camp
[2:56:42] LDubz78: Ya never go for a roam you feel wishy washy about. Either you commit to it 100% or you farm otherwise
[2:56:48] LDubz78: ^^That too
[2:57:15] mangohoe2: I'd recommend taking the enemy's raptor bc you get farm off it and get knowledge of enemy jungler
[2:57:27] grayofblood: OPL has more views than LPL EliGiggle
[2:57:33] grayofblood: EleGiggle
[2:57:35] Wan6Saber: Kappa
[2:57:47] Machrus: Raptors seem to destroy me when Im adc unless I'm like, tristana or something
[2:58:12] weakestlink99: Also, if you get a kill or two off of a gank, try and get another objective if you can. Small advantages can turn into big leads.
[2:58:13] NeedlessToSay: this game needs more cowbell
[2:58:15] mangohoe2: if you are adc, take the golems. Just the smaller one
[2:58:50] mangohoe2: xp is more important than cs in some case.
[2:58:55] mangohoe2: so dont die for farm
[2:59:37] rebeccamo: avoidless finally get back to lpl PogChamp
[3:01:32] LDubz78: LPL=China and LCK=Korea right? I keep confusing the other regions besides NA/EU lol
[3:01:46] Machrus: @MrKill1234 Correct!
[3:01:50] errorm28: true xD
[3:02:17] weakestlink99: What is DAN doing?
[3:02:44] NeoToph: losing
[3:03:07] weakestlink99: Yeah, kind of figured that.
[3:03:34] jurchek8: hahaha
[3:03:55] LDubz78: This is a more competitive game than the LCK one. Jin Air getting rofl-stomped
[3:05:06] weakestlink99: @mrkill1234 The Jin Air I remember would try and stall to the hour mark. Who are they against?
[3:05:33] LDubz78: bbq its 26 minutes in and 11-0
[3:05:45] LDubz78: and 5 to 1 in towers
[3:06:25] weakestlink99: At least it isn't a perfect. Has SKT swam back to Seoul yet?
[3:06:32] roll1ng1: lul no contest
[3:06:41] Cynji: C-C-Combo WutFace
[3:06:42] akcy21: cucacombo etmLol
[3:06:48] roll1ng1: worth kappa
[3:07:07] LDubz78: No idea. I just know this because I'm switching back and forth between LPL/LCK
[3:07:15] LDubz78: streams
[3:07:22] weakestlink99: Wow.
[3:07:38] Revanlol: ^
[3:08:14] weakestlink99: I'm a little delayed, because I have the stream on the TV, but chat on my phone. Sorry.
[3:10:04] weakestlink99: Please don't tell me DAN will try another 20-minute baron.
[3:10:29] 甜野的小迷妹: hmmm SNG might try
[3:10:43] 甜野的小迷妹: no nevermind
[3:11:23] Gyunol: i have this kog skin, its the cheapest one
[3:11:40] akcy21: I hope one day rito will stop killing supports and start making right things
[3:12:15] MisakiKureha: i will love league if they delete yasuo VoHiYo
[3:12:22] BettingDegen: REMAKE
[3:12:30] LDubz78: Dat Rakan play
[3:13:05] weakestlink99: @akcy21 I agree that they need to buff the gold output of the support items.
[3:13:28] LDubz78: ya know when Yasuo first came out I had a feeling he'd be an annoying type of champ...I wasn't wrong
[3:13:33] akcy21: @weakestlink99 eh who cares about gold, it is all about wards and team items issue
[3:13:55] LunarWulfiee: rumble flame horizon
[3:14:24] akcy21: rito exterminated oracle, made pink wards visible, removed usual wards from store, removed healing from mikael, removed team aura from aegis
[3:14:34] akcy21: fuck rito
[3:14:46] MisakiKureha: the friends PogChamp Rachael Kreygasm
[3:15:17] nerobotas: Karin so trash
[3:15:20] halloderbaer: honestly, if you are unhappy with the support role just play something like Brand or Zyra support and build full ap. its viable Kappa
[3:15:39] nemostreamo: im confused because support is stronger than it has ever been
[3:15:41] MisakiKureha: dont forget lux supp PunOko
[3:15:47] LDubz78: ^^^This isn't wrong. It is basically what Rito wants supports to do
[3:15:55] FantasticTT: DansGame TEAM
[3:16:00] roll1ng1: Damn CLEAN
[3:16:23] akcy21: "aegis aura is so strong, that we removed the only team aura from item available in game"
[3:16:44] LDubz78: Ya the aegis removal was dumb
[3:16:47] nemostreamo: because it was just braindead stats
[3:17:03] nerobotas: 30 min into the game. 1 item finished? :DDD
[3:17:05] akcy21: braindead stats? nice choice of words
[3:17:08] nemostreamo: now you have stuff like redemption and new locket that actually let you have an impact on the game
[3:17:11] nerobotas: dat reksai
[3:17:15] MisakiKureha: @akcy21 guess you never played supp around season 2-3 where in 45 min you got your first item and bought 30-35 wards and got 2 gold generateing item PunOko
[3:17:27] nemostreamo: support used to be nothing but ward bots
[3:17:52] akcy21: @MisakiKureha boi, I was playing supp since s3 and I remember not nerfed + gold runes and availability to buy more than one + gold items
[3:18:01] MisakiKureha: compared to that supp today are millioners
[3:18:26] weakestlink99: Yeah, at least support isn't buy 50 wards and a random item.
[3:18:31] nemostreamo: now they have tons of active items to actually impact the game with their own ability instead of just boring flat stats
[3:19:37] roll1ng1: PogChamp ez
