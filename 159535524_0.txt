[2:06:01] CyanideisJoffrey: Eh. It's whatevs. Not my style in general but it's not a big deal. She's gainfully employed doing something she loves.
[2:06:12] Aki_tw: sellout
[2:06:25] nintendolama: Bring back monte a doa rito :(
[2:06:42] EbinIsoViljami: bring back dodosin

[2:07:29] maltkat: frosk good for analyst desk tho
[2:07:56] maltkat: like i said very culture dependent
[2:08:35] Maria0zawa: Frosk just says things she thinks. Not about whats really happening
[2:08:41] CyanideisJoffrey: Do you have something constructive to tack on to your assessment there oh twitch neckbeard obsessed with older asian pornstars?
[2:09:01] Team_Vertex: Frosk is the best <3
[2:09:33] verybiglama: Pulse is an ultimate bro though
[2:09:50] CyanideisJoffrey: She's a color commentator. That's actually her job is to say what she is thinking.
[2:09:59] Maria0zawa: Pulse is biad too
[2:10:06] FishRoeSoup: HAHA sub out the best player LUL
[2:10:15] Maria0zawa: I dont like bias casters

[2:10:24] roll1ng1: pingvin hair 4Head
[2:10:29] myheartdied: Especially champion pool
[2:10:39] Maria0zawa: A caster has to stay neutral
[2:10:45] cantspeel: no they dont
[2:10:49] cantspeel: where does it say that
[2:10:55] CyanideisJoffrey: No, they really don't.
[2:11:18] nintendolama: Swift coco screw them just sub me in I'll carry ez 1v9 VaultBoy
[2:11:23] darkblade83: neutral LUL
[2:11:42] trisssmerigold: frosk likes to say how others are all bad while she's the only one seeing all the problems, rather than analyzing what the teams are trying to do or their strategies
[2:11:55] cantspeel: ^ thats false
[2:11:59] Maria0zawa: Exactly
[2:12:03] CyanideisJoffrey: And she'll dog on LPL players when they're... well, being LPL players. So I am not sure where you are going with that.
[2:12:08] cantspeel: she said specifically last game what snake was trying to do
[2:12:09] darkblade83: Ohq looks so exhausted KappaPride
[2:12:20] cantspeel: also she said that nb was tryin to sit back and let trist get item break points
[2:12:26] cantspeel: you arnt listening very well
[2:12:32] trisssmerigold: which is why she will always be a 2nd tier caster ever, without fixing these issues, some might even find her unpleasant
[2:12:35] FishRoeSoup: um caster is caster, u dont write an dissertation on stream
[2:12:44] CyanideisJoffrey: Also, Snake were running around like recently head
[2:12:50] CyanideisJoffrey: Less chickens
[2:12:52] Maria0zawa: She said Snake desperately went for baron
[2:13:06] goblinguy01: Vasili Kreygasm
[2:13:11] Maria0zawa: And when snake secured it she just shut up
[2:13:13] CyanideisJoffrey: They did. It was a 50/50 with a nearly even game
[2:13:19] nintendolama: Ngl frosk is a good caster
[2:13:28] cantspeel: snake lost 4 champs for that baron
[2:13:28] CyanideisJoffrey: That is a very high risk baron
[2:13:34] darkblade83: I actually like Frosk
[2:13:40] cantspeel: she thought it was high risk desperate baron cuz they couldnt crack the inner towers without it
[2:13:51] cantspeel: they got it and lost 4 champs
[2:13:55] nintendolama: There's a reason why she's chosen by riot to cast s6 worlds and ofc IEMs
[2:13:57] cantspeel: she was actually correct
[2:14:03] darkblade83: it was 3 champs @cantspeel
[2:14:16] cantspeel: ahh ya, j4 didnt die
[2:14:16] nintendolama: I actually expect raz or even pulse to do next worlds
[2:14:41] Maria0zawa: It was not desperate when 2 enemy champs are in lane
[2:14:45] FishRoeSoup: @cantspeel u should be on desk 🤔
[2:14:54] errorm28: stop hating onnher she is cool....
[2:15:02] FishRoeSoup: analyst desk
[2:15:20] errorm28: she is such a nice person and gets so much hate ....
[2:15:22] nintendolama: @fishroesoup I should be on the desk VaultBoy
[2:15:26] CyanideisJoffrey: Dat haterade tho
[2:15:29] cantspeel: desperate may be an overstatement, but her point was that isntead of using their map and vision to crack the tower they defaulted to relying on baron, which was to her was desperate
[2:15:31] trisssmerigold: @cantspeel the problem with Frosk is she likes to generalize things and make the losing team or players look dumb, rahter than analyzing how they tried their best with what their initial intent is,
[2:15:35] cantspeel: i dont understand why that doesnt make sense ot you
[2:16:08] nintendolama: Is this like an actual debate on twitch chat Kappa
[2:16:11] cantspeel: shes definitely more critical of plays , but that is her brand
[2:16:12] Maria0zawa: @trisssmerigold exactly. She analyzes based on the past and she thinks she is always right
[2:16:18] FishRoeSoup: @Elogreenpkease VaultBoy i have deep knowledge of the game and i am handsome
[2:16:33] Maria0zawa: Not on whats really happening
[2:16:35] trisssmerigold: think about it on any games she's casting, the losing side always has such mind boggling stupid movei and strategy, i mean,these guys are at least challenger players backed by coach analyzing the game for life
[2:16:38] cantspeel: i dont understand why deficio can actively sigh and complain about what g2 is doing live on stream and nobody goes "oh god defiicio is being way too hard on g2"
[2:16:56] maltkat: how do you know she thinks she's always right...
[2:16:59] Maria0zawa: And then go on and on about "they should do this they should do that"
[2:17:00] Sharkracer69: who is hudie?
[2:17:00] cantspeel: and if frosk criticizes bottom tier teams its "way too critical"
[2:17:04] Team_Vertex: 0-1?
[2:17:06] darkblade83: u cant never ban sofm lol
[2:17:23] CyanideisJoffrey: She casts in LPL. Mind bogglingly stupid shit happens every game.
[2:17:25] cantspeel: again not true, she explaiend waht htey should do with rift herald before it was used
[2:17:29] nintendolama: Because deficio is an alpha u beta cuck
[2:17:34] cantspeel: that wasnt a past analysis
[2:17:38] Team_Vertex: 0-1?
[2:17:40] trisssmerigold: @cantspeel you failed to understand what we are even talking about, and seems to be arguing for the sake of argueing
[2:17:52] darkblade83: @cantspeel i am with you , she is very infomative
[2:17:55] Sharkracer69: who is hudie? NotLikeThis
[2:18:02] errorm28: i love how every player that played on cj entus is a star xD
[2:18:12] cantspeel: no, im making an argument that she gives pretty in depth analysis using specfici examples of the game we just watched
[2:18:15] trisssmerigold: @cantspeel it's ok, you dont need to accept critism, and i understand you want to stand for your collegue, you ofc wont sht on your own collegue woth us strangers, we're not even talking about you
[2:18:17] errorm28: if you dont know swift and coco played on cj entus XD
[2:18:20] Team_Vertex: 0-1?
[2:18:23] CyanideisJoffrey: Triss, you're arguing about nothing and MariaOzawa is mad because she is a faded porn star.
[2:18:44] nintendolama: I think these guys should be head coaches for team liquid then they can make breaking point 2 for more money ofc paid by Steve VaultBoy @fishroesoup
[2:18:48] darkblade83: sejuani LOL4
[2:19:06] CyanideisJoffrey: New meme is "Paid by Disney"
[2:19:09] Maria0zawa: good arguement cyanide. Shows how much you know
[2:19:12] cantspeel: Everyone can make improvements, and Frosk does, but your criticism doesnt make much sense to me when i can pick out specific moments in the game to refute them
[2:19:34] darkblade83: borianna again
[2:19:45] CyanideisJoffrey: ^
[2:19:47] trisssmerigold: @cantspeel we're talking about genreal casting habit and way of doing it, not a specific case taht she didn't do what. like if you critize someone for being too loud, ofc there are times he's not loud
[2:20:08] FishRoeSoup: @Elogreenpkease VaultBoy head coach: frosk assistant coach: pulse VaultBoy winner of lcs summer split gg ez VaultBoy
[2:20:37] darkblade83: who is the new snake coach ?
[2:20:45] trisssmerigold: @cantspeel if you already set your heart and refuse to accept any criticism, ofc youll find other moments to refute any things being said
[2:20:51] nintendolama: PogChamp
[2:21:19] dragonboy122: grills
[2:21:29] cantspeel: im not refusing to accept criticism, far from it, more pointing out that I dont agree with you on the specific instances you brought up
[2:21:32] nintendolama: My favourite play by play caster is drakos
[2:21:57] Maria0zawa: Frosk kept talking about how bad Snake is mid-game, before the 1st turrets were event down
[2:21:59] CyanideisJoffrey: @maria0zawa I have no reason to take you seriously, so whatevs. evoMcRib have a McRib
[2:22:00] cantspeel: you brought up the desperate baron, and being overly post play analytical, i only gave you examples of when that did not happen
[2:22:01] myheartdied: Just stfu and watch the game
[2:22:02] cantspeel: that is all
[2:22:23] Maria0zawa: that's not analyzing. that's trying to show you know stuff and can predict what's gonna happen
[2:22:37] CyanideisJoffrey: lolol
[2:22:58] CyanideisJoffrey: Do tell what analyzing is if not that.
[2:22:58] dtieubinh: @trisssmerigold love you, my red hair BigBrother
[2:22:59] Maria0zawa: ignored btw
[2:23:11] CyanideisJoffrey: lol ok
[2:23:25] nintendolama: @cantspeel @maria0zawa @cyanideisjoffrey you guys should all just apply for being analysts for riot you all seem like you know what your talking about or you could be paid by Steve Kappa
[2:23:57] Maria0zawa: a guy with Joffrey last name criticizing a pornstar LUL
[2:24:17] FishRoeSoup: ?
[2:24:20] nintendolama: Joffrey from oblivion ?
[2:24:31] cantspeel: haha, its just a discussion, a quality one as well, there was no mal - intent
[2:24:57] Team_Vertex: Why is Snake 1 game over?
[2:25:07] Maria0zawa: when did any of us say we know stuff? LUL

[2:35:33] razlol: I've been exposed
[2:35:47] CyanideisJoffrey: Yeah, but it's Ohq. He's so good mechanically but he is a low game iq player
[2:36:04] CyanideisJoffrey: Kog really doesn't play to his strengths very well
[2:36:50] KappaFrankerZXD: lol every player who plays professionally in 2017 has a high IQ

[4:03:21] darkblade83: ^
[4:03:59] CyanideisJoffrey: The team got complacent because Ohq was supposed to secure with Rend and not be a fucking bonkler. So yeah. That is Snake's fault for expecting Ohq to not do something careless. They should know better. Like, Zztai should've hit the button on his kb for him.
[4:04:04] Maria0zawa: when it's your job to secure baron and you failed, yes it's an individual mistake
[4:05:32] CyanideisJoffrey: Ohq does shit like this all the time. He did it in LCK. He did it in NA. He does it in LPL. He is the posterchild for low game IQ.
[4:05:39] nintendolama: @zoomenhanced I was just saying it's a team fault theres many times where kalista doesn't secure it entirely they had no idea rakan was there and kalista tend can't be calculated in the moment unlike smite so it's not rlly ohqs fault the org is bad the team plays really bad and yea it just doesn't work
[4:05:59] nintendolama: Rend*

[4:55:37] dorp4: Edg can honestly make it far in worlds this year pay attention world
[4:55:48] Rudiko: every region is better than gpl. but GAM is beast
[4:56:09] Cripplespite: @dorp4 true, but that was like last yr hype, lets not hype them up too much
[4:56:16] chrysopelea: the way the GPL is set up is trash

[4:57:56] lokkiiiii: @goblibguy01 His Taliyah just isn't very good :/ He seems very uncomfortable on early game roaming mages
[4:57:56] dorp4: Edg vs ssg in the finals
[4:58:00] Curain18: its all about early game , if one team win early and its better or even with other game is almost over in world level
[4:58:04] AUMamba: china is boss ，but korea just are employee
[4:58:14] f532253947: PogChamp

[5:02:59] dorp4: Mark my words skt without bengi cannot win worlds
[5:03:39] michaelsund: Clearlove getting on form to choke at worlds Kreygasm
[5:03:45] dorp4: EleGiggle actually bengi cover for faker camping and mistakes
[5:04:26] Cripplespite: @dorp4 the coach take losses very seriously on skt, they are going to be in top form before worlds and that is just skt cuz they have a 100% world championship rate when they qualify..
[5:04:51] Symphoneers: His hair just keeps getting taller...

[5:06:48] dorp4: They will not just change over night
[5:07:18] Cripplespite: they dont have overnight they have months
[5:07:47] dorp4: It doesn't matter ssg and lpl teams proved that they are above this overrated skt
[5:08:32] Cripplespite: if skt qualify for worlds just know they won it 3 times alrdy
[5:08:33] dorp4: Dude ssg won clean 2-0
[5:08:52] dorp4: WutFace typical negative mind state
[5:08:56] Cripplespite: only chance is they dnt qualify like season 4
[5:09:13] Cripplespite: how am I in a negative mind state? ur in a dream state
[5:09:19] dorp4: EleGiggle again dude this statements will not get you far in life
