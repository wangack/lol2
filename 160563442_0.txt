[2:27:06] daddymoch: guoguo used to be better on orianna before he got a lazy eye
[2:27:06] darkblade83: Gougou is a better 5v5 i think
[2:27:12] RustyTheCaster: he had some massive shockwaves
[2:27:38] papasquizz: but after that stroke back in 09 it hasnt been the same
[2:28:03] dtoaster58: ^ wut

[2:36:18] lokkiiiii: yea
[2:36:44] lokkiiiii: But Ohq's decision making
[2:36:52] daddymoch: j4 can 1v1 fiora until lvl 15 1/2
[2:37:11] GLPhoenix: theres a reason "just ohq things" became a thing
[2:37:14] FishRoeSoup: half big item down already, how to 1v1 Kappa
