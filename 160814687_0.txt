[3:11:41] jaekun93: Cait is good in early and late game but there is a gap in the mid game towards her 3rd item
[3:11:41] WhoKnowsUA: @disabled_turkish_delights she actually have really weak midgame it was her known weakness for seasons, her rework with traps little improved that but if u're not sieging she's still weak during midgame

[3:13:00] Lord_Knt: Aremca3 No, that's the point
[3:13:00] WhoKnowsUA: Kog, Vayne, Jinx, Twitch and trist are the only one hypercarries in the game, Other may have good late but can't be hypercarries. Like Ashe, Cait they are strong late. That's it
[3:13:17] Gta_based_god: tfw your hair looks like a paintbrush
[3:13:20] Bandillo64: aahe has obe of the lowest dps late
[3:13:25] twilek321: Regrup pls stop talking all you do is make yourself look stupid
[3:13:25] Bandillo64: cait has one of the highest
[3:13:25] BaldursDottir: @disabled_turkish_delights aaah fair call ;)

[3:13:52] Bandillo64: ashe is good late because of her utility
[3:13:57] Kuuzoon: yeah vayne is bretty bad atm
[3:14:14] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 she have decent DPS, she have her own Q steroid
[3:14:17] michaelsund: Does utility kill a 5k hp 400 armor sejuani?
[3:14:20] jaekun93: KR Ashe priority Kappa
[3:14:24] Lava_Sam: that guy is as stupid as his hair is LUL
[3:14:34] Bandillo64: decent for a champ yes but low for an adc
[3:14:38] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 she's good late bcs of her 600 range permaslow from AA and good DPS
[3:14:40] vhhush: Cait can single destroy fights having like, tanks and peel champions to assist her
[3:14:50] Bandillo64: ye slow as i said utility
[3:14:59] Bandillo64: good dps no
[3:15:00] EgonThyPickle: Cait has shit dps. The only thing she has is range. Compared to Ashe she has way worse base stats and way worse steriods.
[3:15:25] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 her DPS is higher thatn Cait's outside of headshots which is 6 AA
[3:15:29] vhhush: Cait low dps is the biggest bullshit i've heard really
[3:15:35] grand_sizulate: can lucian be a hypercarry too TriHard Kappa
[3:15:38] Bandillo64: no its not
[3:15:41] merthins: Ashe is only worth her utility, which measn that as soon as the opposing team get's qss'es, she becomes a severe downgrade. Caitlyn outscales her heavily. Stop.
[3:15:54] Lord_Knt: Cait has the 8th highest total damage of all ADCs
[3:16:05] michaelsund: Lucian best hypercarry TriHard
[3:16:07] jaekun93: Mord is the hyper carry you need Kappa
[3:16:13] dragonboy122: who won
[3:16:16] WhoKnowsUA: @merthins her utility isn't only ult u can't QSS every single AA which is why she's strong late 600 range with permaslow autos
[3:16:25] GrisBauer: Wonder why argue on a twitch chat. Get a team guys u got so much talent on analitics 4Head
[3:16:47] Bandillo64: ashe atm is the lowest dps adc together with kalista
[3:16:47] GrisBauer: TriHard best adc TriHard not even joking
[3:16:49] EgonThyPickle: Cait has REALLY low base attack speed which means she scales really bad with attack speed. The only steroid she has averages out to about 10% extra dps.
[3:16:51] dragonboy122: who ewon
[3:16:55] KappaFrankerZXD: hey guys what roster is NB fielding in game 1 today?
[3:16:55] mujarshad: Are people arguing whether cait is hypercarry or not? 4Head typical twitch chat
[3:17:00] twilek321: Regrup User successfully ignored LUL
[3:17:02] merthins: The problem being Caitlyn with 3 items outranges her completely. Ashe can only kite, she cannot chase.
[3:17:03] Bandillo64: cait is at 8th place
[3:17:11] jaekun93: I don't understand , chatting and arguing is part of twitch chat experience , it's quite fun
[3:17:19] Bandillo64: ye it is :)
[3:17:26] nemostreamo: tfw LJL more viewers than LPL
[3:17:27] dragonboy122: who won
[3:17:31] vhhush: It's interesting arguing as well
[3:17:33] Bandillo64: IM won
[3:17:36] GrisBauer: Its funny to see gold chat argue VoHiYo
[3:17:45] WhoKnowsUA: exactly Cait got nerfed AS scalings on her own. She have really low AS in lategame now even while building double zeals there is ADC who outDPS her in a straight fight
[3:17:46] merthins: I am Diamond V haHAA
[3:17:46] BadCopyDoge: Pulse hair WutFace
[3:17:56] nemostreamo: hey i'm plat 5 with a 44% winrate Kappa
[3:18:06] Lava_Sam: I like how nobody is really pointing out that a adc can only dps if their team has a good front line, j4, seja carried not cait
[3:18:17] Bandillo64: i mean with the nerfs i can see the argument of cait not being the best adc late
[3:18:18] michaelsund: Sivir late game is Kreygasm anyway
[3:18:22] Lord_Knt: well that's the role
[3:18:26] Bandillo64: but she does way more dmg than ashe
[3:18:30] EgonThyPickle: Seriously, even Sivir has higher dps than Caitlyn.
[3:18:36] nemostreamo: sivir will be back in the meta
[3:18:37] vladik_vinogradik: dat chair Kreygasm
[3:18:40] GrisBauer: Sivir
[3:18:43] Lord_Knt: she doesn't
[3:18:44] Bandillo64: sivir is 10th atm
[3:18:47] GrisBauer: 2017
[3:18:52] GrisBauer: Pick one
[3:18:54] vhhush: Sellout
[3:18:56] EgonThyPickle: Where do you get these stats from?
[3:19:03] Bandillo64: guys you have enough stats just look them up
[3:19:05] merthins: Ashe, Jhin are picked primarily for utility, you can literally ask any pro player, and they'll tell you the same.
[3:19:09] grand_sizulate: sivir only has high dps if the enemy team groups up and takes ricochets up the ass FailFish

[3:19:18] michaelsund: @grisbauer tank comps + Sivir next patch
[3:19:25] nemostreamo: yeah but there are gonna be 2-3 tanks in comps so sivir will be back

[3:19:41] OMEGALAUGH: N1 intel EleGiggle
[3:19:46] GrisBauer: Tank and sivir ? wut?
[3:19:51] EgonThyPickle: Caitlyn has good siege tools which is why her damage is inflated
[3:20:03] EgonThyPickle: It's not like total damage dealt is a good indicator of dps
[3:20:04] Bandillo64: ashe was always one of the lowest dps adcs
[3:20:07] GrisBauer: There is still varus and trist why the fuck people would chose sivir
[3:20:07] michaelsund: ThunBeast TheThing
[3:20:08] pnkuU: chinese ads but western music lul
[3:20:31] vladik_vinogradik: GRILL
[3:20:38] nemostreamo: sivir will be for her ult
[3:20:48] Bandillo64: so that means a poke champ like varus should be high on the list
[3:20:50] grand_sizulate: sivir might be good if her mana costs got lowered or something
[3:20:50] GrisBauer: wich has been slighty nerfed
[3:20:54] pnkuU: WutFace
[3:20:54] vhhush: Why are asian girls so pretty
[3:20:55] Lava_Sam: @Regrup implying zac stood in front of vladmir once that game
[3:20:57] Tripep: IMay won?
[3:20:58] EgonThyPickle: I mean, Xerath deals on average 4k more damage per game than Caitlyn so I guess Xerath has some insane Dps, right?
[3:20:58] Bandillo64: but hes not
[3:21:01] Lord_Knt: varus without lethality has shit damage
[3:21:13] jaekun93: Varus can't poke turrets Kappa
[3:21:21] nemostreamo: it actually depends on how the toplane meta turns out
[3:21:21] Kuuzoon: IMAY MOM PogChamp
[3:21:41] WhoKnowsUA: @GrisBauer if u miss varus ult it's pretty much done, plus he rely alot on procing his W with skills do deal highest damage. While sivir do not rely on landing ult, she just use it and u engage
[3:21:41] vhhush: Drakthar got buffs for ranged champions, so Lethality ads will be back soon

[3:21:58] vladik_vinogradik: WTF is happening
[3:22:03] Lord_Knt: exactly what dubu_dubu said
[3:22:13] pnkuU: athena's bag got stolen BibleThump
[3:22:16] Lord_Knt: Duskblade is only broken in soloQ
[3:22:17] Kuuzoon: their parents are getting gifts from their kids
[3:22:19] jaekun93: Auto attack and spell rotation scales differently to be real, not a good comparison
[3:22:23] nemostreamo: like if you have a cinderhulk sej and a full tank maokai running at you, jhin is just absolutely useless
[3:22:32] WhoKnowsUA: @EgonThyPickle any poke champ will outdamage his team eventually if he's not sucking hard
[3:22:37] rofflepie: they are giving away key to a Jeep in one of the bags
[3:22:43] Lord_Knt: why is he holding the mic
[3:22:45] vhhush: Duskblade is good in soloQ becuase soloQ can't maintin their vision dcontrol @disabled_turkish_delights

[3:23:13] nemostreamo: linkin park BibleThump
[3:23:14] EgonThyPickle: @Regrup Yeah, that's my point. Caitlyn isn't 8th in damage dealt because she has high DPS. It's more because she has good siege tools and high range.
[3:23:21] KappaFrankerZXD: predictions for IG vs NB?
[3:23:25] WhoKnowsUA: @dubu_dubu just need more draven picks, and she won't be picked that much xD

[3:24:29] WhoKnowsUA: @EgonThyPickle we was talking about lategame damage if her team isn't sieging it's hard to proc headshots very often plus her AA scalings got nerfed really hard + she have no own steroids, her raw DPS is really low compared to any other ADCs
[3:24:29] Cicero172: when are the next games comin on

[3:24:58] Bandillo64: her raw dps is not low its average atm
[3:24:58] pnkuU: LUL
[3:25:00] KappaFrankerZXD: IG taking game of RNG does bode well for them, however I am unsure as to whether that was because it was Uzis first series back.
[3:25:03] Dat_Newt: "begone thot" LUL

[3:25:10] KappaFrankerZXD: Hard to accurately gauge the level they are at currently.
[3:25:25] EgonThyPickle: @Regrup Yeah I know, that's the point I've been trying to make. The argument I was responding to was that she had high dps because her damage per game was high.
[3:25:32] 6775674564: Who knew chinese had nice legs Kreygasm
[3:25:44] Lord_Knt: Why wouldn't they
[3:25:51] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 she have like worst AS scalings from all ADCs if i remember now ? bcs of her strong early she had to payoff there

[3:26:43] PKOmega: 🚗
[3:26:52] Bandillo64: she has bas as scalings for months now still rocking the late game because of range + escape tool with e + traps and decent dps
[3:26:52] khriz0571: Jeep o///o
[3:26:59] dan_kweed: HEY GUYS LET'S ALL BUY A JEEP

[3:28:10] khriz0571: his name is Raz
[3:28:11] EgonThyPickle: @Bandillo64 You're correct in that her range + escape + traps makes her good late game. Her dps does not since it's shit compared to essentially every other adc.
[3:28:24] Bandillo64: its not shit tho
[3:28:45] nemostreamo: oh wait, that coco
[3:28:47] Heylon: cait dps is not shit, it's decent

[3:29:27] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 only jinx have worse AS at lvl 18 than Cait 0.7 but Jinx have her own steroid plus higher range. Her E btw is in the weak state it can be interrupted plus u need to click backwards and it's harder than for example Lucian
[3:29:30] Bandillo64: ashe kalista and atk speed varus have shit dps
[3:29:34] jaekun93: Duke choking on his gum Kappa joking

[3:30:50] SealTeamFish: Vibrating gaming chairs
[3:30:53] Bandillo64: ashe is not very strong early game
[3:30:59] Bandillo64: varus kalista i agree
[3:31:10] nemostreamo: theshy is a riven one trick
[3:31:13] Sitro28: NB haHAA fan haHAA
[3:31:16] EgonThyPickle: @Bandillo64 I'm not sure if you're serious or not. A Corki that doesn't use spells can probably out dps Cait
[3:31:18] michaelsund: The Shy Riven otp LUL
[3:31:19] Bandillo64: cait does have her passive traps and net procc thats hella more dmg
[3:31:39] khriz0571: who tf is theshy
[3:31:40] boeniman: why is there no space between the team tag and the name of the player ? NotLikeThis feels so wrong
[3:31:42] Heylon: @regrup sorry if I interrupt ur 1v1 argument, but a good cait weaves in traps and net shots, which is her steroid and gives her decent dps
[3:31:44] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 ashe is very strong lvl 1-3 plus depends on support matchup, but kalista is the most dominant laner there
[3:31:56] EgonThyPickle: @Bandillo64 Her traps and net doesn't really help her dps tho...
[3:32:03] Bandillo64: it does
[3:32:10] nemostreamo: i wish they just banned camille/fiora/jax and then theshy would have nothing to play
[3:32:10] WhoKnowsUA: @raven13x in siege scenarios yes but in chaotic fights not at all
[3:32:13] vladik_vinogradik: cait ban Kreygasm
[3:32:14] ChoppedMutton: Traps definitely help her dps
[3:32:14] rofflepie: the chinese client is on linux, doesnt allow white space in names
[3:32:45] nemostreamo: its a good pick to give west and megan first pick since west is garbage
[3:32:50] khriz0571: wtf
[3:32:58] vhhush: Bro, if you think caothic fights are not god situation to cait's traps something is wrong, You can create zooning inside fights lol
[3:33:08] nemostreamo: let rookie get a counter pick 100%
[3:33:10] dontspacelook: when can jackeylove start playing?
[3:33:22] ChoppedMutton: Rumble in the Jungle
[3:33:29] Bandillo64: and cait will land a trap or a net in a teamfight
[3:33:30] gojiranutterbutter: Rumble jungle!
[3:33:33] Sitro28: Jayce jungle LUL
[3:33:37] nemostreamo: hopefully soon enough to get IG into the playoffs
[3:33:41] Lava_Sam: ashe pick incoming?
[3:33:42] EgonThyPickle: Even if traps help her dps she still has the worst base attack speed of all adcs. Something like Ashe Q will always provide a bigger dps boost than traps.
[3:33:46] khriz0571: Rumble mid PogChamp
[3:33:46] WhoKnowsUA: @raven13x plus if u use your E in 5 v 5 just to make "little more" damage without killing yor target u're leaving yourself without defensive tool pretty much, against divers like Jarvan/Gnar it can be fatal
[3:33:47] Bandillo64: and dont forget the dmg boost the traps give you
[3:33:54] rofflepie: jackylove is gonna play beginning of this split, but some owners blocked it for some unstated reason
[3:34:00] rofflepie: was gonna*
[3:34:02] Bandillo64: little more ?
[3:34:13] WhoKnowsUA: Traps works only as AA reset but in late u won't see a difference
[3:34:15] Bandillo64: you can 2 shot an enemy adc with trap net combo
[3:34:23] Whitelline1: rookie god
[3:34:24] dontspacelook: @rofflepie thanks, so hyped to see him
[3:34:57] EgonThyPickle: You're talking about burst now, not dps
[3:34:59] vhhush: @Bandillo64 Not inside fights cuz probabily enemy's adc will be so far to be hit by trap net
[3:35:01] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 any hypercarry except vayne outrange Cait, why would some1 come near her to get shotted in face lol
[3:35:04] ASkyNightly: Rookie top 3 mid laners world
[3:35:08] rofflepie: the current timeline is for sesaon 8, cause even if he comes in now it is prob too late for a s7 rush
[3:35:15] vhhush: But caitlyn has either burst and decent attack speed
[3:35:21] rofflepie: but he might come in for gauntlet run or something
[3:35:23] KappaFrankerZXD: @Sungazes on certain champs, on others he looks like garbage
[3:35:24] khriz0571: why is everyone fighing because of Cait? makes me sad BibleThump
[3:35:29] nemostreamo: cait with 2 zeal items and berserkers has about 1.45 attack speed now
[3:35:34] Bandillo64: any dmg is counted towards dps
[3:35:48] Heylon: @regrup regrup thats very true. that's why i would say cait needs a little more help and set up from her team than other adcs to unlock her full dmg potential. which isnt the best, but not that bad either.
[3:35:52] league_of_lul: PogChamp
[3:35:58] Sitro28: New champ PogChamp
[3:36:00] WhoKnowsUA: @Naeyeng she have like top 3 bottom AS without any steroids relying only on AS items like double zeal

[3:36:07] synchronousx: tf PogChamp
[3:36:09] rofflepie: NB should swap rumble to jungle, gragas top is a good lane against camille
[3:36:17] Bandillo64: cait is good because she doesnt need much help from her team
[3:36:29] rofflepie: rumble gets eaten alive by camille after 1 kill

[3:36:39] 6775674564: WutFace
[3:36:51] vhhush: Well , no nerfs cait could 1v9 games just by having someone tanking damage for her
[3:37:00] vhhush: That was broken
[3:37:00] khriz0571: SKT Duke PogChamp
[3:37:02] WhoKnowsUA: @raven13x the point is why would u do that if u have much better hypercarries like twitch jinx trist kog or vayne who can shoot ppl from much safer distance or have more tools to shred enemy team
[3:37:16] Bandillo64: vayne sucks early mid
[3:37:22] Bandillo64: jinx is too immobile
[3:37:25] EgonThyPickle: I mean, Ashe with no items and Q has more attack speed than Cait with 2 Zeal items. Not sure how you can argue that Cait has better dps
[3:37:25] ASkyNightly: CJ Coco LUL
[3:37:26] TheFurioso: ORIANNA SYNDRA CORKI TALIYAH ResidentSleeper TF AZIR VIKTOR PogChamp
[3:37:29] Bandillo64: twitch and trist are top adcs atm
[3:37:30] gojiranutterbutter: Seejay!
[3:37:52] Bandillo64: because ashe does less dmg per shot
[3:38:01] nemostreamo: top 5 adcs are gonna be cait, trist, xayah, ashe and varus in no particular order
[3:38:07] EgonThyPickle: What, she does damage per shot
[3:38:12] WhoKnowsUA: @raven13x give the same protecting tools u give to your cait and your hypercarry will do job much better. It's just Cait who have strong early laning phase one of the reason's why she's still picked but she's not hypercarry
[3:38:19] jerleejl: TTours
[3:38:24] vhhush: trist depends on her Q many times
[3:38:44] EgonThyPickle: *more damage per shot
[3:38:51] vhhush: and twitch whit no R struggles on fights
[3:38:52] rofflepie: cait has no weak mid game anymore cause u accel the game so much by going BF zerker and trade towers over and over
[3:39:08] rofflepie: rift herald also accelerated that process by a lot
[3:39:09] vladik_vinogradik: 1 raptor PogChamp
[3:39:10] Heylon: @regrup because no one has a safer distance than cait actually, in a siege situation, which also is useful for objectives. so it depends on ur comp. if you have a strong tf, get a hypercarry, if you need to siege, get cait. thats how I see it
[3:39:22] vhhush: Let's go IG
[3:39:25] FrozenGecko: which patch are they playing on?
[3:39:31] fepl_: Rookie PogChamp
[3:39:32] nemostreamo: 7.13
[3:39:39] FrozenGecko: ty
[3:39:40] vhhush: @raven13x Tris lvl 18 has more distance than cait
[3:39:53] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie have u ever encountered a tank champ in midgame as cait in midgame with 1.5 items? if u didn't she have no tools to kill him in adequate time
[3:39:53] vhhush: Actually Tris the best ad imo
[3:40:06] Lava_Sam: Lee gotta gank mid if they want to win
[3:40:06] 6775674564: Shy PogChamp
[3:40:08] rofflepie: cait doesnt even fight with 1.5 items anymore
[3:40:14] KappaFrankerZXD: THEY KNOW TriHard
[3:40:29] rofflepie: there is a reason everyone goes BF zerker into aspd item before IE
[3:40:40] gojiranutterbutter: No mumbling!
[3:40:51] rofflepie: when u finish IE, u would have at least 1 aspd item and zerker already, and u'll have a team fight powerspike
[3:40:53] Bandillo64: many pro players started going IE rush for the ad spike
[3:40:58] rofflepie: before that u lane swap top and mid to siege
[3:40:59] nemostreamo: any adc that can't build BOTRK is gonna be in trouble
[3:41:09] WhoKnowsUA: @raven13x i see it like this, most pros are pussies plus they have expectations and high pressured from coaches/fans so they just too scared to pick weak hypercarry and lose lane hardly, they rather pick strong cait win lane > scale late decently
[3:41:14] michaelsund: I don't like IE rush at all
[3:41:19] fepl_: Rookie LUL
[3:41:21] rofflepie: IE rush exsist but it is not standard
[3:41:26] Lava_Sam: that's so rough for tf
[3:41:28] Bandillo64: me neither
[3:41:32] vhhush: IE rush is not that good
[3:41:40] rofflepie: standard build is still BF, zerker, 1 aspd item, then finish IE
[3:41:40] vhhush: you lose so many early clearwave
[3:41:43] gojiranutterbutter: The cj buddies!
[3:41:48] vhhush: that you would have whit stattiks
[3:42:19] rofflepie: that aspd changes depends on the game, asian teams still build hurricane the most
[3:42:22] Bandillo64: ye i asked some pros in solo q about it they told me its for the ad in mid game
[3:42:28] Bandillo64: and the lucky crits hurt

[3:42:53] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie cait with IE and double zeals steal have no tools to shred tanks and it's around midgame. Some1 like poppy or new pick Chogath with 1.5-2 armor items would be unkillable for her. U need to waste money to buy LW and lifesteal to nod die fast enough against tank's base damage, until then Cait have no damage and u're saying she's decent midgame lol

[3:44:11] WhoKnowsUA: tell it my monkeys in soloq that they should let me play around my traps

[3:44:44] vhhush: Cait is good
[3:44:46] rofflepie: good luck getting on the cait with ur tank in a straight fron to back comp, and i didnt say cait is strong mid game, pro teams knows that and accel the mid game by tower trading and sieiging instead of force 5 on 5
[3:44:53] Bandillo64: cait is one if the best adcs in lower elo imo
[3:45:16] WhoKnowsUA: cait is top adc if u want to play that role actually
[3:45:24] vhhush: You need skill to play it
[3:45:24] rofflepie: if u wanna force 5v5 with 2 items tehre are tons of better adc's
[3:45:26] scottoflorida2014: Who won last series
[3:45:35] nemostreamo: imay
[3:45:35] WhoKnowsUA: if u're new and want to learn adc u just should try cait firstly
[3:45:39] scottoflorida2014: TY
[3:45:53] rofflepie: but cait is perfectly fine as a team fighter after IE zerker and 1 zeal item
[3:46:04] vhhush: I do not agree whit cait 1st, when I tried it for 1st it was so shitty
[3:46:08] nemostreamo: id actually recommend ashe because at least you can arrow if you arent doing too much damage but cait is good too
[3:46:12] vhhush: I rather do better on Varus
[3:46:17] vhhush: And tristana as well
[3:46:17] michaelsund: Ashe is probably easier
[3:46:22] vhhush: Ashe is easy btw
[3:46:24] scottoflorida2014: Ashe is the easiest to learn on imo
[3:46:26] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie against no armor targets yes. she's fine and do alot of damage
[3:46:31] scottoflorida2014: or Jhin
[3:46:52] Shinji10TH: Actually Kalista is best to start with, you learn all you need to know about adc with her, even if you'll hate yourself at first
[3:46:54] nemostreamo: i wouldnt learn the role on jhin though, learn other ADCS first then jhin
[3:46:59] vhhush: Jhin is made for people who ccan control their timings
[3:47:05] WhoKnowsUA: Ashe isn't easy lol u totally rely on your ult to be landed plus she have no escapes. As cait u can often go 1 v 3 in lane if your support is a monkey u can't do that with Ashe
[3:47:27] scottoflorida2014: Whats easy for one may be tough for another
[3:47:33] vhhush: But u have to learn 1st, u cant 1v3 if you're a newbie as well
[3:47:33] rofflepie: the primary role of cait before late game is not to force skirmishes, her primary role is in lane, thats why u dont see cait in jungle a lot for no reason, u should stay in open lane, and rely on trap line to siege and position
[3:47:35] LaFuetes: i think cait is a good pick with the right comp, but i do think she will see less play with the AS scaling nerf in the recent patch.
[3:47:47] scottoflorida2014: Just go with the best ADC ever...write it down. TEEMO :D
[3:47:54] WhoKnowsUA: @Shinji10TH i won't recomment Kalista lol kalista player need good mechanics, it's even harded to lasthit with her since u can't cancel your autos
[3:47:56] nemostreamo: rookie gettin SHAT on
[3:48:00] scottoflorida2014: Mushrooms everywhere for the win
[3:48:03] gojiranutterbutter: Mechanics!
[3:48:06] burnburnbaby: teemo is free elo
[3:48:37] Lava_Sam: Lee complete non factor riPepperonis
[3:48:51] nemostreamo: lee getting outpressured by a gragas = gg
[3:48:51] WhoKnowsUA: @Shinji10TH plus her W and R rely totally on your bond partner which is bad for soloq, u will be solo very often for various reasons
[3:48:54] vhhush: Cait was my free elo pick cuz i'm good lol
[3:48:55] Shinji10TH: @Regrup Exactly, with her you learn adc very well, since she has all the weaknesses you can have for unexperienced players, on top of her emphasizing the need to be with your support
[3:49:13] burnburnbaby: Teemo is harder then Cait
[3:49:25] vhhush: But if you put cait in the hands of a retarded she won't do any shit
[3:49:54] the_meme_king: @Naeyeng of a retarded
[3:50:22] BIGDADDYJONES69: IM GOOD BTW haHAA
[3:50:44] vhhush: I did 100k dmg whit cait in a 39min game, Broken shit
[3:51:08] ItsEmanuel: vasilli - mor please
[3:51:19] WhoKnowsUA: @Shinji10TH exactly why u won't recomment her for new players, Why do u think Kalista have always have low pickrate in soloq? except times when she was boosted and even then she havn't highest pickrate amongs all ADC? Bcs u had to rely on your support which is really bad for soloq
[3:51:34] mujarshad: no vasilii????
[3:51:43] nemostreamo: yeah playing kalista without being duo with your support is a nightmare
[3:51:54] the_meme_king: haHAA
[3:52:29] KappaFrankerZXD: FINED
[3:52:36] WhoKnowsUA: @dubu_dubu yeah i saw kalista spammers like Rekkless or Freeze in the past spammed her only while duoing and never solo
[3:53:08] rofflepie: make a totally original game like LoL and have chars that are totally original like ashe(drow), blitz(pudge), and taric(omniknight)
[3:53:19] vhhush: Rely on random people that you don1t trust is bad for soloQ in many situations
[3:53:23] VizeReZ: I wish they didnt make Kalista quite so duo reliant. I want to be able to do something when my support isnt there
[3:53:49] nemostreamo: missing cannon minion WutFace
[3:53:50] Heylon: @vizerez then dont pick kalista
[3:54:02] Heylon: Kappa
[3:54:06] WhoKnowsUA: @VizeReZ yeah same although i like her i do not even pick her anymore since they changed her W, too often i can't even ult some1
[3:54:06] VizeReZ: i dont, for that exact reason
[3:54:09] rofflepie: they should just let u ult on kalista without a partner by tossing a ball into a spot like syndra W
[3:54:24] rofflepie: and have same effect as kalista ult knockup

[3:59:18] rofflepie: 1.6 recoil was so smooth compare to the random jumping in csgo
[3:59:33] WhoKnowsUA: i actually do not even play csgo anymore but games are much more entertaining than in regular league games like LPL LCK LCS just bcs it's on Majors with international games
[3:59:59] nemostreamo: csgo is fun to watch but awful to play
[4:00:06] VizeReZ: I dont watch CSGO much because C9 doesnt get very far.

[4:03:30] WhoKnowsUA: @VizeReZ i was fan of N0thing he's arguably the only legendary player NA produced over these years, watched him in late 2000s in 1.6, sadly he was always the only 1 good performer

[4:05:33] TheFurioso: SHY SO BAD
[4:05:49] nemostreamo: west had 0 damage during that entire thing lul
[4:05:53] rofflepie: u know waht funny, SKT had a crap early game for ages, it is just everyone is playing with too much respect to them mid game when ahead, like KT against skt in all the games, WE showed that skt is vunerble to dives and forced plays mid game
[4:06:03] VizeReZ: The teams macro is falling apart. I will not say Bang and Wolf are super lane dominant, but they are nasty team fighters
[4:06:07] rofflepie: so all the LCK teams knows how to punish them mid game with a lead now
[4:06:07] nemostreamo: although its mostly on the shy there because he shouldnt have engaged when his team was that far away
[4:07:14] nemostreamo: WEST LUL
[4:07:23] nemostreamo: that was the most wildturtle thing ive ever seen

[4:17:31] nemostreamo: i need to see vasili tristana
[4:17:39] rofflepie: 2-0 im
[4:17:41] mujarshad: IM 2-0
[4:17:44] VizeReZ: Pulse does good work. just dont get him in a slow part of a game.
[4:17:50] nemostreamo: 2-0 IM, both games were super boring
[4:18:34] rofflepie: SN seems like a gatekeeper team, they are good enough to win lspl but dont have a superstar to carry them and nothing particularly strong to play off of in the LPL so they are struggling
[4:18:36] VizeReZ: Vedius was way worse of a caster for EU imo. Vedius should be a content creator for riot or a desk man.

[4:18:43] AnElegantMan69: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
[4:18:45] Alrai17: What is this LANGUAGE Anele
[4:18:54] AnElegantMan69: thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

[4:19:23] rofflepie: omg EU casters makes like 100 mistakes a game now, I was facepalming so hard earlier today when they talk about the cho making the right play going for the silence to prevent the smite
[4:19:38] nemostreamo: driving in china is horrifying
[4:19:40] AnElegantMan69: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

[4:20:45] rofflepie: driving in china is like team fight in lpl, it doesnt make sense to u a lot of the time and they engage at weird times, but it is a controlled chaos and everyone knows waht to do
[4:20:52] VizeReZ: oh yeah, their game knowledge is pretty trash besides Deficio. And they have almost 0 peripheral vision. only seeing one thing missing half the fight. It hurts to watch EU
[4:21:14] AnElegantMan69: @christineew muscle bb
[4:21:24] VizeReZ: They have nice shout casters besides Dracos in EU though.
[4:21:31] mujarshad: Deficio and Kobe are the best western casters

[4:21:59] itsBursty: papasmithy best caster world
[4:22:02] dan_kweed: @mujarshad you spelt Phreak wrong
[4:22:05] ceo_at_aldi: JATT? 4Head
[4:22:08] nemostreamo: i know there is no shoutcaster in that trio but it would be awesome
[4:22:10] rofflepie: EU caster just piss me off cause they have zero knowledge of the game now, like cc not preventing smite (outside of suppresion)
[4:22:13] mujarshad: @dan_kweed Jebaited

[4:22:48] decco41: jatt and phreak are just biased casters fking trash
[4:22:48] VizeReZ: They need Krepo back so they can have some smarts in EU. also there is no caster with good bot lane knowledge.
[4:23:09] shinamon345: they have budget krepo the new guy Kappa
[4:23:19] dan_kweed: where did Krepo go?
[4:23:22] rofflepie: they cant hire krepo back, its not just an image thing anymore, they need him to get the legal stuff out of the way 100% before even considering that
[4:23:22] kongkozyga: VoHiYo it's the wrong hole, krepo VoHiYo
[4:23:27] mujarshad: poor Henning 4Head
[4:23:29] ceo_at_aldi: best tri-cast is pulse, vedius and razzle - disagree and you're racist FUNgineer
[4:23:33] nemostreamo: krepo is in riot jail
[4:23:45] decco41: FUNgineer
[4:23:46] VizeReZ: Phreak is biased as hell, trash talks every play, tries to both color and shout cast, and he misses so much in game as well.
[4:23:51] jaekun93: Krepo retired from being a caster due to the nude leak
[4:24:20] VizeReZ: Jatt is not as biased as people make him out to be. he just compliments really good parts of plays, usually made by winning teams like TSM.
[4:24:21] cryptus__: @VizeReZ that hes always trying to color cast is triggering me so much NotLikeThis

[4:27:46] AnElegantMan69: *synchro
[4:27:59] jaekun93: look does matter i think, maybe thats why i dont like papasmithy since he looks so old
[4:28:02] VizeReZ: yes. i know season 1 worlds was cast from his basement
[4:28:02] AnElegantMan69: i post a palpatine quote and then they talk about him
[4:28:06] nemostreamo: jax has a ~30% winrate globally in competitive i think
[4:28:23] nemostreamo: well at least in korea, but its probably below 40 worldwide
[4:28:27] VizeReZ: but that doesnt mean he knows all the intricacies that the constantly changing and developing metas.
[4:28:46] rofflepie: they should have a tricast of sjokz frosk and nikasaur, sjokz do play by play, frosk does analyst, nikasaur talking about their skins and how pretty the rift looks
[4:28:51] nemostreamo: duke is LITERALLY twice the size of megan
[4:28:55] VizeReZ: im not going to watch 6 year old games.

[4:29:41] VizeReZ: i actually cant follow any thoughts you are trying to do here @christineew
[4:29:43] AnElegantMan69: I think they should just have all of the asian female casters and interviewers doing every region

[4:35:11] choko97: skt jax
[4:35:31] mujarshad: the gragas was dumb, he saw lee on ward, just go to his blue wtf
[4:35:39] VizeReZ: The Jax pick is also pretty good into mini Gnar.
[4:35:40] rofflepie: IG draft would be one of the best comps if they didnt last pick jax for some reason and went for the standard jarvan
[4:36:07] itsBursty: gragas clearing bot side, tp up for top laner, i wonder if they try to make a play soon...

[4:38:01] nemostreamo: wow.. then it truly is the best west adc
[4:38:18] rofflepie: did u watch deft kog the other day
[4:38:36] deadcarnie: duke needs to learn to cs
[4:38:38] rofflepie: he was feeding so hard to bait an engage and exploded on everyone so smeb can clean up
[4:38:39] nemostreamo: yeah if this was renekton or jarvan id be much happier with the draft
[4:38:41] VizeReZ: i mean Kogs passive does true damage. True damage = tank breaker.
[4:39:04] rofflepie: then again deft is acutally just really bad at kog and doesnt know waht he is doing
[4:39:06] nemostreamo: "best midlaner in china"

[4:56:33] rofflepie: that baron also did nohing regardless if the steal happend or not
[4:56:37] MoldyCalzone: nice pants Kappa
[4:56:38] VizeReZ: Jax could have beat the gnar hard if gnar wasnt hand fed kills and buffs
[4:56:41] kynsareth: If they gave Jax any sort of support that could have helped them quite a bit
[4:56:49] deadcarnie: duke got hung out to dry
[4:57:05] Moeesy: Rookie FeelsBadMan

[4:57:31] Lava_Sam: LUL
[4:57:32] nemostreamo: duke wondering who his boosted ass jungler and ADC are
[4:57:33] rofflepie: galio is auctally perfectly fine on good midlaners
[4:57:35] letmefaaarm: JEEP?
[4:57:37] deadcarnie: xD
[4:57:38] Jackp0tta: Duke LUL
[4:57:41] ChodeHammer: are jeeps sold in china?
[4:57:42] rofflepie: their comp is just crap
[4:57:45] AnElegantMan69: Jeipu!!
[4:57:47] scribbin_: Duke FeelsBadMan Rookie FeelsBadMan
[4:57:58] Moeesy: SaltyFrosk
[4:58:00] mujarshad: @rofflepie no... galio is fine if you have other carries
[4:58:03] MoldyCalzone: LUL
[4:58:06] kongkozyga: gnar rapes jax wtf , especially when he have 2 kills and red buff to start with
[4:58:06] scribbin_: SaltyFrosk
[4:58:08] Lava_Sam: @rofflepie not when Lee makes your jungler non existent
[4:58:09] VizeReZ: The IG comp wasnt that bad. stop trying to blame the comp
[4:58:10] world303: FeelsBadMan
[4:58:21] VizeReZ: Jax beats mini Gnar
[4:58:24] rofflepie: nothing on rookie would have saved that game
[4:58:28] scribbin_: Jax in 2017 LUL
[4:58:38] rofflepie: i just hate the argument casters make that best midlaners cant play galio
[4:58:45] VizeReZ: mini gnar is where you beat gnar at all
[4:58:53] MisakiKureha: Jax need a bit of baby sit early and its okey
[4:58:59] deadcarnie: i bet half the casters cant even play galio right
[4:59:01] Lava_Sam: Jax wins like every 1v1 tho, it's a 5v5 game for a reason this isn't solo q
[4:59:11] one_more_plz: dont play protect adc comp if your adc is bad FailFish
[4:59:20] scribbin_: wut lck midlaners play a lot of galio
[4:59:23] mujarshad: Ning fed a kill and red buff to gnar cause he got tilted that lee stole his blue
[4:59:24] pwipiri: TehePelo TehePelo
[4:59:27] hiephero: TriHard OneHand
[4:59:38] ChodeHammer: that color doesnt work for the dude in the middle
[4:59:39] MisakiKureha: I am sick of mid Gallio PunOko I want mages and asassins PunOko
[4:59:47] VizeReZ: that is the win condition with Jax though. Win the 1v1. stay ahead and split
[4:59:48] deadcarnie: that mohawk
[4:59:52] ChodeHammer: he needs a darker suit
[4:59:52] rofflepie: xiaohu is the best player on RNG when uzi is not playing (arguable when he is) and xiaohu plays galio all the time, its not about protect the adc comp, galio is actaully GOOD, since it is more defensive than mages but it is not a "cant make play champion"
[5:00:08] rofflepie: samething as xiye, faker played galio mid too
[5:00:09] VizeReZ: he isnt a team fighter, although he can pull it off with a good Jax
[5:00:19] one_more_plz: pulse hair WutFace
[5:00:25] scribbin_: pawn faker and kuro all looked good on galio
[5:00:30] Moeesy: Pulse hair PulseChamp
[5:00:33] VizeReZ: Galio is also a really good wave clear champ.
[5:00:34] MisakiKureha: @youkai111 its the grandson of songoku
[5:00:40] TNNRLoL: they aren't saying good mids can't play gallo, however if your bot lane is awful why play towards them
[5:00:41] VizeReZ: can hold the mid laner in mid lane.
[5:00:43] RustyTheCaster: I'd argue Xiaohu is the best player on the team with Uzi playing for sure @rofflepie
[5:00:45] ChodeHammer: @youkai111 pulse, used to be EULCS caster but he was bad so he went to LPL
[5:01:00] Moeesy: Rustythecaster PogChamp /
[5:01:10] insaneddie: he got tired of everyone making fun of him
[5:01:12] RustyTheCaster: @ChodeHammer or he chose to move because of the opinions of sheep being needlessly rude to a good caster
[5:01:12] MeAladel: TriHard
[5:01:18] scribbin_: @RUSTYTheCASTER RustyFace
[5:01:23] Lava_Sam: @xPekeIsG0d whoever is making picks for IG is on crack, why does anyone pick Jax there
[5:01:25] rofflepie: thats why i said arguable, thats not the point, the point is that teams that have mid laner is their best player, GALIO mid is perfectly fine
[5:01:45] RustyTheCaster: There are teams where Galio mid isn't fine on, RNG isn't one of those
[5:01:47] deadcarnie: i just wish ppl would stop picking corki mid. so tired of seeing it.
[5:01:58] MisakiKureha: No Gallio mid is not fine PunOko its not fun at all to whatch PunOko
[5:01:59] VizeReZ: Mid laner is their best player, and their side lanes arent disabled. need both for Galio.
[5:02:08] scribbin_: i miss corki in bot lane BibleThump
[5:02:14] TNNRLoL: it isn't fine on a team where your bot lane is literal garbage
[5:02:15] ChodeHammer: @RUSTYTheCASTER he tried to meme way too much in EULCS and would regularly go off on tangents, he's gotten better since he moved to LPL
[5:02:18] VizeReZ: i dont even think mid needs to be the best character.
[5:02:39] RustyTheCaster: @ChodeHammer Sure, but everyone still treats him like he is the EULCS memer, even if he has improved
[5:02:41] Lava_Sam: isn't galio good late game? isn't that why NB picked lee?
[5:02:44] deadcarnie: he had NO team to back him
[5:02:46] TNNRLoL: at a certain point gallo will do nothing to help if everyone else is useless
[5:02:49] world303: Pulse hair PogChamp
[5:03:01] Snowbear22: @RUSTYTheCASTER reputations are hard to change
[5:03:04] rofflepie: if everyon else is useless nothing would help them
[5:03:06] VizeReZ: I think Pulse is a great caster when there is something to cast. He was stuck mostly casting lane swaps and had to fill. not his strong suit.
[5:03:08] scribbin_: @RUSTYTheCASTER how much hair product does pulse go through
[5:03:09] RustyTheCaster: Exactly @Snowbear22
[5:03:18] rofflepie: the point is, just cause mid is ur star player doesnt mean u shouldnt run galio comps
[5:03:19] deadcarnie: anyone with a brain wouldnt stand by a tower with 2 champs and a rift herald
[5:03:19] RustyTheCaster: @Ssimple0 hair spray is a beautiful and underused tool
[5:03:25] rofflepie: IG is just dead, nothing will save them
[5:03:27] TNNRLoL: but the point is if they picked better this wouldn't of been an issue
[5:03:39] rofflepie: but teams like TSM for example, they 100% sure learn galio comps
[5:03:40] Snowbear22: @RUSTYTheCASTER so is that a confirmation of at least 2 per day?
[5:03:48] TNNRLoL: it has nothing to do with running those comps and everything to do with allocating resources to shit players
[5:03:53] RustyTheCaster: @Snowbear22 2 what exactly
[5:03:56] banshee_beat: it's a cockatoo!
[5:03:56] rofflepie: same with lots of other teams that has mid laner as their star
[5:03:58] TNNRLoL: because they have the players to use that comp
[5:04:04] scribbin_: @RUSTYTheCASTER seems like a pain to keep up but he's pulls it off
[5:04:20] Snowbear22: @RUSTYTheCASTER 2 cans of hairspray
[5:04:22] TNNRLoL: but if your bot lane is the worst of the worst why waste everything relying on them
[5:04:26] RustyTheCaster: Yeah look I'm not to the hair extremes these guys are but I agreee, talk about a lot of effort
[5:04:38] astropuma: KappaPride
[5:04:41] Snowbear22: :P
[5:04:49] banshee_beat: a lot of effort to look like a cockatoo Kappa
[5:04:51] scribbin_: @RUSTYTheCASTER not everyone has naturally beautiful hair like you KappaPride
[5:04:55] VizeReZ: Pulse has to cut those sides at least once a week.
[5:04:57] world303: @RUSTYTheCASTER touch it, I bet it's so crisp Kreygasm
[5:04:58] deadcarnie: lol @banshee_beat
[5:05:02] astropuma: PJSalt
[5:05:18] TNNRLoL: exactly like they said
[5:05:20] rofflepie: rookie tried to play tf game one and spread his presence around, it obv didnt work, they are trying something new, but like I said, nothing can save IG now, but best player midlaner shouldnt play galio, is a stupid argument
[5:05:22] VizeReZ: Galio works with teams that work well together.
[5:05:27] RustyTheCaster: absolutely it does Banshee, even atlus put time into looking like pidgeotto
[5:05:29] mujarshad: duke fell behind because of Ning cmonBruh
[5:05:30] TNNRLoL: if Jax was okay then it would of been fine
[5:05:35] astropuma: WutFace
[5:05:48] TNNRLoL: that isn't the argument tho
[5:05:49] deadcarnie: id rather spend time on my beard then spend time looking like a cockatoo
[5:05:51] RustyTheCaster: Raz tried cutting his own hair once, never again
[5:05:55] TNNRLoL: you are arguing something no one has said
[5:05:57] JohnIn3D_: lol
[5:06:02] RustyTheCaster: @Deadcarnie lost me at growing a beard rip
[5:06:03] mujarshad: LOOOOOOOl
[5:06:25] rofflepie: thats lietrally waht frosk JUST said, and EU casters say the samething (might have been NA i dont recall 100%)
[5:06:36] moonlandingwasfake9: i cant listen to this lesbian
[5:06:37] deadcarnie: @rustythecaster sucks to be you. been growing my beard for 3 years
[5:06:54] VizeReZ: There was the Bjerg playing Galio. but they were trying it while working on that type of team play
[5:06:55] banshee_beat: @RUSTYTheCASTER Pidgeotto XD
[5:06:57] RustyTheCaster: @Deadcarnie BibleThump
[5:07:03] TNNRLoL: no they said why put him on gallo because your botlane is awful so you should play around your strongest player. if jay would of worked then its fine like they said but it didn't
[5:07:12] TNNRLoL: and then they had to rely on the worst bot
[5:07:17] JohnIn3D_: dont make rusty cri! qtpSMORC
[5:07:35] RustyTheCaster: that's ok they're tears of not being as masculine as beard growers
[5:07:38] VizeReZ: you have face nipples WutFace @youkai111
[5:07:42] Moeesy: HeyGuys QT SUBS HeyGuys
[5:07:45] RustyTheCaster: I'm going to the gym 2 times a day to make up for it from now on
[5:07:47] deadcarnie: i got that wizard beard status, it's almost at pirate status
[5:08:00] JohnIn3D_: KonCha @Moeesy
[5:08:09] RustyTheCaster: The day I can grow a full beard, I will have a full beard
[5:08:36] mujarshad: rip the beard dream Kappa
[5:08:37] deadcarnie: its nice, especially when you start going bald
[5:08:48] Sk82478: wtf is his hair?
[5:08:51] VizeReZ: One incident with a firework and i cant grow a full beard. FeelsBadMan
[5:08:52] RustyTheCaster: it's like your head hair has fallen prey to gravity
[5:08:57] RustyTheCaster: and moved around your face
[5:09:00] Sk82478: why don't his friends tell him it looks terrible
[5:09:04] deadcarnie: exactly
[5:09:06] mujarshad: @RUSTYTheCASTER WTF LOOOOOOl
[5:09:07] rofflepie: rookie on mages cant win now cause IG has deep issues, galio isnt their first choice of comp given the tf game 1, but it didnt work and they are trying to mix it up. Frosk didnt even mention bot lane, all she said is, rookie best player, best player shouldnt play galio
[5:09:14] rofflepie: LCS caster said the same thing before
[5:09:21] rofflepie: which annoys me
[5:09:50] VizeReZ: When on a team with no cohesion like IG right now, Frosk is right
[5:10:06] VizeReZ: Frosk didnt take the 4 minutes to explain her full point.
[5:10:06] RustyTheCaster: if one day someone came in with a beard and a clean shaven head I'd absolutely just make the joke
[5:10:16] Megmegmurp: @rofflepie Frosk said that west and Megan are the worst in the league tho
[5:10:18] mujarshad: no
[5:10:21] deadcarnie: @rustythecaster my hair started falling prey to gravity at 27
[5:10:25] rofflepie: that comp made no sense in the first place, like they are trying to compy WE comp at RR, but last pick Duke went, nah i dont like jarvan lets play jax lul
[5:10:26] deadcarnie: feelsbadman
[5:10:28] RustyTheCaster: disaster
[5:10:37] JackTT_TV: Rusty is the only good lpl caster
[5:10:42] VizeReZ: THE JAX PICK WAS FINE.
[5:10:51] JackTT_TV: or should i say "the best"
[5:10:52] RustyTheCaster: naw man, thanks for the compliment but I like who I work with!
[5:10:56] deadcarnie: it happens when you have to much stress in life
[5:11:00] RustyTheCaster: We're all veryyyy different
[5:11:16] Tf_da_god: Who won game 2?
[5:11:19] JackTT_TV: i'm sure they're nice people.
[5:11:20] deadcarnie: nb
[5:11:46] Kaiseri: Spawn2 is very good indeed Kappa
[5:11:50] RustyTheCaster: y'all are being too kind
[5:11:50] deadcarnie: @tf_da_god NB 2:0
[5:11:53] RustyTheCaster: this is meant to be twitch chat
[5:11:57] RustyTheCaster: SMOrc
[5:12:01] JackTT_TV: spawn isnt ever on lpl FeelsBadMan
[5:12:03] rofflepie: that jax pick was 100% wrong in that sitation when u A) have the other 4 picks B) already know u r against gnar
[5:12:04] mujarshad: rusty you smell BabyRage
[5:12:08] Jackc0in: @rustythecaster youre shit SMOrc
[5:12:11] JackTT_TV: GG
[5:12:11] RustyTheCaster: Spawn was on once!
[5:12:16] RustyTheCaster: Cya tomorrow peeps
[5:12:24] RustyTheCaster: don't you dare be nice to me again or I'm coming for you SMOrc
[5:12:25] JackTT_TV: have a good one guys!
[5:12:31] mujarshad: rusty, how was casting opl today?
[5:12:32] JackTT_TV: sorry rust
[5:12:35] Jackc0in: okay SMOrc
[5:12:36] cantspeel: HeyGuys Night fam
[5:12:39] RustyTheCaster: was good @mujarshad actually a lot of fun
[5:12:43] Kaiseri: tomorrow LGD vs Snake FeelsGoodMan
[5:12:47] VizeReZ: Jax can win vs the Gnar. Jax can split to give two win conditions. Jax can still dive and disrupt the back line.
[5:12:49] mujarshad: sounded like it :D
[5:12:59] RustyTheCaster: you too! peace
[5:13:05] JackTT_TV: @RUSTYTheCASTER where do you guyus cast from?>
[5:13:12] RustyTheCaster: Sydney
[5:13:14] VizeReZ: the argue for J4 is the cataclysm to hold the team in a box for Kogmaw damage.
[5:13:23] JackTT_TV: whats the time differnece
[5:13:29] VizeReZ: otherwise J4 loses to Gnar unless massive outplay
[5:13:31] JackTT_TV: difference from cn to oce
[5:13:31] deadcarnie: LGD, DAN, and OMG gonna win tomorrow
[5:13:41] RustyTheCaster: 2 hours atm
[5:13:43] RustyTheCaster: so not that bad
[5:13:57] RustyTheCaster: alright I'm off, cya mate
[5:14:01] VizeReZ: the Renekton can beat Gnar until Gnar gets 2 items.
[5:14:05] rofflepie: even if jax is even with gnar without the 2 kills, gnar can hold jax fine pretty much all stage of the game, 4 1 split u want a midlaner that can 1 shot waves, which galio isnt really unless u build AP, no one players 4 1 split with galio mid
[5:14:13] KappaFrankerZXD: LUL rito games
[5:14:33] deadcarnie: off to watch fragbite
[5:14:50] VizeReZ: If you keep gnar spliting vs Jax then the 4 man of IG can probably win the fight if not super behind
[5:14:52] KappaFrankerZXD: good cast
[5:14:56] KappaFrankerZXD: ggwp
[5:15:07] FictionByBeast: Who won today?
[5:15:14] VizeReZ: you dont always draft like your team is total garbage. then you are trying to play soloq and not improve
[5:15:36] KappaFrankerZXD: IM 2-0 SNG, NB 2-0 IG
[5:15:42] rofflepie: no its not that, galio gragas kog braum is not a good 4 man unit at defending thats the point
[5:15:56] FictionByBeast: Thanks @kappafrankerzxd
[5:15:57] sf_tcec_champion: If anyone here can boost me to diamond send me whisper.I am currently g1 euw.
[5:16:00] KappaFrankerZXD: Both relatively convincing series.
[5:16:02] rofflepie: kog, in particular LPL kog, doesnt play defensive
[5:16:34] KappaFrankerZXD: However, Imay could have lost game 2 if they didn't make a couple of key decisions.
[5:16:35] rofflepie: go watch spring and summer kog games, the best games are when they are engaging and kog is chasing ppl instead of the other way around, thats why u see tons of kog kled games in spring
[5:16:54] rofflepie: and in summer the galio jarvan comp
[5:16:55] VizeReZ: And you think IG had no engage on those champs?
[5:17:13] VizeReZ: TP flanks from Jax make great engages too
[5:17:18] VizeReZ: which they mentioned
[5:17:19] rofflepie: they are no where near the comp that jarvan galio provides
[5:17:36] rofflepie: and jarvan comes online way earlier than jax
[5:17:48] VizeReZ: J4 100% can hold them in place longer. but had no chance against a gnar
[5:17:53] rofflepie: like someone mentioned earlier, u dont want that type of double scaling
[5:18:12] rofflepie: u dont need to paly jarvan, someone like camille makes way more sense
[5:18:18] rofflepie: cause of the double ult synergy
[5:18:29] KappaFrankerZXD: u have to consider the players ability and confidence on your suggested picks
[5:18:34] VizeReZ: Camille pushes people away.
[5:18:34] KappaFrankerZXD: which u don't have access to
[5:18:39] VizeReZ: how is that synergy?
[5:18:52] VizeReZ: and has 1 man cc.
[5:18:52] rofflepie: what, galio camille was run by tsm like last week
