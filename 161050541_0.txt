[2:54:00] 伊哭: lgd is so
[2:54:04] MirinStatus: Jeep MVP LUL

[2:54:57] nameless_typhlosion: yeah, and imp doesn't want to play without pyl
[2:55:12] rofflepie: i actualy think, consider language and things, best adc for KT is mystic
[2:55:22] rofflepie: but WE wuld never let him go
[2:55:50] Tking94: Who will win WE or OMG?
[2:55:55] TheDaydreaminOne: sucker? Kappa
[2:56:27] DterrorA: So Deft doesnt speak Korean? Kappa
[2:56:29] rofflepie: mystic doesnt try to be too flashy early, and always get his farm, and does well late game team fight, KT is a top side team early, let smeb and score control the pace of the game early and let bot carry late game team fight
[2:56:54] rofflepie: deft is getting caught left and right trying to ward and poke

[2:58:04] rofflepie: deft's issue with KT is that he is trying to demand too mcuh in lane, and mid game he is super off atm
[2:58:06] PoliticalMuffin: why did Dan change rosters though?
[2:58:17] PoliticalMuffin: they lost like 1 series
[2:58:27] rofflepie: he still think he is in EDG with clearlove camping for him 24/7
[2:58:27] 4_Matt: anyone want to play flex 5s, need one more (NA gold/plat) msg me
[2:59:01] rofflepie: KT against skt game 3, without those 2 deft getting caught they win 100%
[2:59:08] Tking94: Who will win out of OMG and WE?
[2:59:24] MirinStatus: WE wil win 2-0
[3:00:22] MirinStatus: MingLee
[3:00:38] DterrorA: Well, you can point out even some of Smebs plays earlier this season, which lost them some games. Not to mention Pawn... I generally don't think Deft is the problem
[3:00:50] luccid: \ TriHard >
[3:01:10] rofflepie: watch the games kt lose to skt, esp the recent sets, deft is getting caught every single game
[3:01:26] rofflepie: and his last game on kog, i have no idea what he is doing
[3:01:40] rofflepie: every other kog in asia goes hurricane, deft goes RFC
[3:02:03] luccid: Video games are just like basketball 4Head
[3:02:08] Eolios: who won the first set
[3:02:08] 4_Matt: anyone want to play flex 5s, need one more (NA gold/plat) msg me
[3:02:11] rofflepie: and he would die every team fight at the start, but good thing is he got a good passive off last team fight and smeb cleaned up
[3:02:28] DterrorA: Whatever. It's not a trend, so Deft is okay atm. If he continues to do so, then we can talk about change
[3:02:35] xamuan: Donald Trump won because he is a winner
[3:02:54] DterrorA: Heck, just because Faker played like shit vs LZ doesn't mean SKT have to change him right now
[3:02:56] Eolios: I think a lot of people are sure pawn has returned back to form

[3:15:51] MirinStatus: you realize he has one of the best stats for NA midlaners right?
[3:15:58] michaelsund: Wat is he really getting benched ? WutFace
[3:16:07] MirinStatus: highest DPM, highest CS/M
[3:16:18] rofflepie: stat doesnt mean everything, his playstyle is a big part of the reason EF struggles
[3:16:19] MirinStatus: it's not due to performance, that's for sure

[3:16:43] SSG_Crown: @ThunBeast_TheThing VisLaud
[3:16:43] JuKeNDiVe: Is Froggen benched I thought EF was just doing the dumb 10 man roster thing
[3:16:44] rofflepie: there is a reason why froggen having high cs number = bad for his team
[3:16:58] MirinStatus: are you stupid lmao?
[3:17:13] Eolios: did dan gaming bench ggoong
[3:17:24] michaelsund: @rofflepie Ye but without him they will get relegated 100%
[3:17:25] MirinStatus: so Jensen and Bjerg who also have high dpm and csm are also ''bad for their team''
[3:17:31] JuKeNDiVe: Froggen took a lot of resources but he was also the most consistent performer on his team
[3:17:31] MirinStatus: you're obviously clueless
[3:17:44] rofflepie: froggen unless he changes his playstyle, will never be a elite mid laner again
[3:18:01] MirinStatus: i love it when bronze players try to analyze

[3:19:16] Rall0Tubbs: @rofflepie dafuq u trying to writte about froggen is a elite mid laner
[3:19:19] rofflepie: no, his high cs number is EXACTLY why ppl say his playstyle need to change
[3:19:26] michaelsund: @dan_kweed chinese gatorade Kappa
[3:19:54] MirinStatus: what ''people'' are you refering to, because every professional opinion of it is that EG is making a mistake
[3:20:07] rofflepie: froggen's biggest issue is lack of presence early and mid game, and he doesnt roam enough, he tried to change that when he first went to NA, but with his team struggling he is back to i am gonna sit mid and farm to 6 item playstyle
[3:20:18] rofflepie: this is exactly why he has best cs numbers
[3:20:23] MirinStatus: you must have read a few reddit threads and think you have a qualified opinion now
[3:20:27] rofflepie: and his team not like that and he is benched atm
[3:20:40] Rall0Tubbs: @rofflepie before writing something about him go check is back history or the amount he makes on the team he is atm
[3:21:45] michaelsund: TheThing ThunBeast TheThing
[3:21:55] rofflepie: i watch every single NA lcs game, i dont need to go check back history, froggen has very high resource but doesnt do enough, same issue has jensen atm
[3:22:34] weakestlink99: DAN is 4-5, 2 matches up on Snake and IM, the 5th place teams in group A. JDG is 2-8, 3.5 matches behind LGD, the 4th place team in group B.

[3:28:54] rofflepie: i am not gonna bother talk to u about froggen anymore, he is not even relevant anymore and I dont know why you ppl worship him, so have fun

[3:29:54] Kxmx_Rin: @weakestlink99 It was such a weird moment when I realized that "EDG Zet" is actually Rox Cry. the ex-midlaner from the Rox Tigers. LUL
[3:29:55] KappaFrankerZXD: DansGame
[3:30:05] CasterFroskurinn: Zet came over with Nofe
[3:30:30] CasterFroskurinn: and I think there's pressure on Nofe to make it work with Zet despite his lackluster start in LPL because Nofe felt responsible for him
[3:30:36] CasterFroskurinn: But zet is doing better now
[3:30:59] weakestlink99: I actually didn't recognize him.
[3:31:03] PreacherCasts: Dan B? More like Dan qi

[3:31:32] Kxmx_Rin: @CasterFroskurinn it was just a weird moment when I was like "huh? i somehow know that one.... then i checked and saw that he was on Rox tigers as midlaner. LUL )
[3:31:38] rofflepie: RR gave a lot of confidence to zet, and lost a lot of confidence for smlz, zet even lost his Z-god title to smlz after rift rivals
[3:31:59] Kxmx_Rin: @rofflepie Z-god? xD wat?
[3:32:07] rofflepie: its a meme in china
[3:32:13] CasterFroskurinn: Chinese memes are best memes
[3:32:17] rofflepie: something- god is a meme title
[3:32:27] get_updownleftright: where the fk is goong?
[3:32:37] rofflepie: funny was the fa-god, eimy was the jungle-god, last season
[3:32:44] rofflepie: something-god means u r going really bad
[3:32:52] Kxmx_Rin: oh alright
[3:32:56] Kxmx_Rin: and why "Z" ? :|
[3:33:06] rofflepie: zet start with z, smlz end with z
[3:33:08] weakestlink99: Zed, I think.
[3:33:28] weakestlink99: Probably not, actually.
[3:33:31] rofflepie: it might not matter in korea
[3:33:47] rofflepie: cause it was a big issue cause he was fighting chinese trainees i tihnk
[3:34:03] Kxmx_Rin: ah k, so i thought correctly cuz the only thing that came to my mind was the Z for Zet and the Z for smlZ 4Head
[3:34:14] rofflepie: so there might be a race thing there, and chinese ppl would stand 100% with their chinese trainees in situation like that
[3:34:22] rofflepie: but its not 100% clear what casued it
[3:34:24] SenatorSpacer: Are they on 7/14
[3:34:29] CasterFroskurinn: 7.13
[3:34:39] SenatorSpacer: eh
[3:34:49] SenatorSpacer: ty tho
[3:35:06] PreacherCasts: @SenatorSpacer Count the Duskblades. It's 7.13 ;)
[3:36:04] Osteoid: Kabe LUL
[3:36:12] SenatorSpacer: duskblade didnt get buffed in 7/13
[3:36:31] CasterFroskurinn: he's saying its 7.13 because theres no duskblades
[3:36:32] SenatorSpacer: 7/14 is live
[3:36:37] OverRaid96: !patch
[3:36:40] SenatorSpacer: my bad
[3:37:10] CasterFroskurinn: Dark DoinB is best DoinB.
[3:37:54] weakestlink99: @casterfroskurinn Does Tencent get patches later than, like, NA or other regions?
[3:38:02] rofflepie: this lineup of jdg is prob better than the one with clid anyways, xinyi is doing fine and they dont have the rotation door adc anymore
[3:38:14] CasterFroskurinn: @weakestlink99 yes. It's a tencent client and not a Riot one in China.
[3:38:33] SenatorSpacer: What's the rules difference?
[3:38:51] CasterFroskurinn: There's no rules difference but a different process about how the patch is implimented and when
[3:39:00] Osteoid: DAN DansGame
[3:39:13] CasterFroskurinn: the client is also very different in use than the NA one - at least in my experience. There's a lot more plugins
[3:39:15] SenatorSpacer: kk ty @CasterFroskurinn
[3:39:16] paarthurnaks61: who will win do you think froskurinn
[3:39:27] SenatorSpacer: Im used to used kayne at this point
[3:39:29] CasterFroskurinn: This game?
[3:39:32] Vennntil: LUL
[3:39:33] paarthurnaks61: ye
[3:39:35] BloodbrotherHS: Jebaited
[3:39:39] CasterFroskurinn: JDG
[3:39:50] paarthurnaks61: aight thanks :)
[3:40:25] weakestlink99: @casterfroskurinn It makes me wonder if it is possible to use the Tencent client outside China.
[3:40:30] fighterslayer: when is the lpl finals froskurinn? VoHiYo
[3:40:37] CasterFroskurinn: @weakestlink99 we used to use it in australia
[3:40:51] CasterFroskurinn: The finals are september 3rd or 4th
[3:41:11] RustyTheCaster: Is that the real Froskurinn
[3:41:16] fighterslayer: 1 more month Jebaited
[3:41:18] CasterFroskurinn: Is that the real Rusty
[3:41:23] weakestlink99: Hey @rustythecaster .
[3:41:34] rofflepie: what u mean use it outside of china, to play chinese server or to play other server, u cant play other server on it 100%, but to play chinese server u can do it on NA, it is just very bad ping
[3:41:34] Kxmx_Rin: Is that the real Rairyou nb3W
[3:41:43] RustyTheCaster: watsup @weakestlink99
[3:42:06] rofflepie: there is no region block for the chinese server
[3:42:15] weakestlink99: Not much, just watched DAN abort a baron attempt.
[3:42:18] Osteoid: FeelsBadMan
[3:42:37] RustyTheCaster: @weakestlink99 ;)
[3:42:40] Kxmx_Rin: there it is Dan20minuteBaron Kappa
[3:42:53] Osteoid: ??
[3:42:55] CasterFroskurinn: I would like a different play, Dan
[3:43:27] CasterFroskurinn: "300 confirmed baron kills"
[3:43:30] weakestlink99: At least they got 2 copies.
[3:43:43] RustyTheCaster: if nothing else, we win the baron
[3:43:59] paarthurnaks61: JDG will win this
[3:44:43] CasterFroskurinn: Teams dying in dumb spots tilts me.
[3:44:55] Osteoid: Wow
[3:45:17] CasterFroskurinn: saltyfrosk
[3:45:19] KappaFrankerZXD: i'm not sure if doinb just finds great moments to ult on cass or if DAN players are rubbish at dodging it
[3:45:28] Ryechuchu: Frosk not casting live tilts me FeelsBadMan
[3:45:38] Ryechuchu: Great 1st game cast though~
[3:45:45] CasterFroskurinn: That was rough - but thank you
[3:45:47] CasterFroskurinn: PBP is hard
[3:46:00] CasterFroskurinn: helps that I know all the answers to the questions I ask though. lol
[3:46:32] nerobotas: -1570
[3:46:37] weakestlink99: This ends up about -1500g for DAN. Not worth.
[3:46:52] CasterFroskurinn: How are these teams all going negative in their Baron plays?! WHY TEAMS WHY
[3:47:01] BalaaGun: not true, they got to push bot
[3:47:18] BalaaGun: they lost a 1st tier tower and dragon
[3:47:21] Osteoid: Bot lane feed
[3:47:51] CasterFroskurinn: Unless Locken just loses his mind, JDG will walk over them.
[3:48:11] CasterFroskurinn: Kog maw with three completed items and a fed cassi to stand next to him
[3:48:16] Munchinsteaks: JINX
[3:48:46] weakestlink99: I would advocate not going for Baron if I were DAN.
[3:48:54] rofflepie: breaking bot inhib tower is huge though, renek is botk build he can split push on shen all game now, it gave them another win condition to split bot to win
[3:49:11] CasterFroskurinn: Not breaking the inhib is the miss though.
[3:49:51] Munchinsteaks: lies is past his peak on renek shen should easily be able to sway him away right now
[3:49:56] rofflepie: they can still get it, of course taking inhib there and not losing 3 would make that baron a huge win, but losing 1.5k to take bot inhib should still be worth
[3:50:03] CasterFroskurinn: They need to kill Shen and then TP/Package to the fight over Baron.
[3:50:11] CasterFroskurinn: or just take the inhib with 2
[3:50:28] Munchinsteaks: yeah the inhib is not worth
[3:50:44] Munchinsteaks: for the baron they had to kill shen otherwise they would of lost the baron fight too
[3:51:08] CasterFroskurinn: The inhib being broken should lock the baron down and minimize the dmg JDG an do with it
[3:51:10] BalaaGun: gee gee
[3:51:12] N4m3Lss: What patch is this? 7.13 or 7.14?
[3:51:16] CasterFroskurinn: 7.13
[3:51:23] N4m3Lss: thx
[3:51:58] CasterFroskurinn: What. Are. Dan. Doing.
[3:52:41] TiesAU: who won first set?
[3:52:48] CasterFroskurinn: this is bad fight for Dan

[4:01:15] weakestlink99: We are so hype for that Xpeke, but if JDG get reverse swept, they will be 4 out of playoffs.
[4:01:19] Beetrayn: damn

[4:04:52] Beetrayn: RustyFace 👌
[4:04:55] CasterFroskurinn: How far back Dan's coach wears his headste upsets me. I get anxiety that it'll fall off.
[4:05:39] Kxmx_Rin: maybe its not his headset, maybe its his haircut Kappa
[4:05:49] CasterFroskurinn: Loken is so cute!
[4:06:10] Kxmx_Rin: I'm somewhat hyped for WE vs OMG tbh.
[4:06:12] rofflepie: not everyone has a hair cut designed for headset 24/7 like pulse
[4:06:27] Kxmx_Rin: @rofflepie exactly
[4:06:40] weakestlink99: @rairyou That's going to be a good match.
[4:06:59] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn Who do you think is the best mid in LPL right now?
[4:07:06] Kxmx_Rin: @weakestlink99 I hope so :D will be the first game of OMG which I'll be watching
[4:07:16] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora Rookie based on raw talent
[4:07:23] rofflepie: how does pulse hair even work without headset, does it just wax it up like he does right now, or forward split and have a blob in front
[4:07:36] CasterFroskurinn: I have to fix Pulse's hair and get his headset on without smashing it
[4:07:48] Kxmx_Rin: thats a good question @rofflepie
[4:07:54] Beetrayn: aw thats cute
[4:08:09] CasterFroskurinn: He has a mohawk and the headset ruins it really. Because it just fans around his head. Before games I tug and pull his hairs into the correct places
[4:08:27] Beetrayn: hair pulling luxxGasm
[4:08:30] Kxmx_Rin: his hairs DansGame
[4:08:30] Ryechuchu: You can't just part it like the Red Sea?
[4:08:33] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn Not trying to say Rookie is bad, but what's holding back IG if he's the best in the LPL?
[4:08:33] Beetrayn: i mean what
[4:08:43] weakestlink99: Where is the Galio going?
[4:09:00] Kxmx_Rin: guess midlane? :o
[4:09:06] weakestlink99: Could be top, mid, or support.
[4:09:06] rofflepie: he is not the best, and ning and west are both worse than kid on jungle and kid on adc
[4:09:07] Kxmx_Rin: or maybe the good ol' galio Jungle
[4:09:08] kingdarude7: support
[4:09:12] rofflepie: and kid was bad
[4:09:21] Beetrayn: double adc jungles PogChamp
[4:09:25] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora Their bot lane is weak - probably the weakest in the LPL. With a learning jungler, rotatng top, weak bottom, and a poor draft that takes power from Rookie and doesn't allow him to hard carry - iG will sit in flux
[4:09:42] weakestlink99: Not support.
[4:09:46] Kxmx_Rin: @CasterFroskurinn so you think Rookie should change teams? :o
[4:09:55] Beetrayn: Braum adc PogChamp
[4:10:03] rofflepie: like, literally Duke Kid Rookie KId megan will do 2x better than current IG
[4:10:10] CasterFroskurinn: @Rairyou Rookie loves iG and he should stick with the tea that makes him happy, but they need Jackeylove to come of age
[4:10:10] kingdarude7: this comp is <3
[4:10:31] PortableCorpse: Lemme ask you the more important question: Who is the cutest player in LPL?
[4:10:38] CasterFroskurinn: ATHENA
[4:10:40] CasterFroskurinn: is so cute!
[4:10:40] paarthurnaks61: lel
[4:11:00] BalaaGun: Vlad pick= lose right?
[4:11:10] weakestlink99: Galio mid with Syndra or Orianna left up. Picks Vlad.
[4:11:14] Kxmx_Rin: I guessed correct with the galio midlane Kreygasm
[4:11:14] PortableCorpse: Well, I wish I could disagree
[4:11:30] rofflepie: galio is 90% mid in lpl and lck
[4:11:38] PortableCorpse: I'm just now getting in to LPL, seems fun from the games I've seen so far
[4:11:46] CasterFroskurinn: LMS is the only region that plays Galio Top - and his winnrate is atrocious in top lane
[4:12:25] rofflepie: EU also run galio top and support, but EU does EU things
[4:12:36] Beetrayn: luxxYikes VoHiYo look at my sign
[4:12:41] Kxmx_Rin: havent seen a galio top in eu in some time though :|
[4:12:50] CasterFroskurinn: EU is weird because their top laners have really strange pools so they a lot of the time have a very different top meta than global meta
[4:12:50] Kxmx_Rin: seeing things like J4 and so on quite a lot now
[4:13:07] paarthurnaks61: what u think about team setups frosk? bout this match
[4:13:09] CasterFroskurinn: Mithy spoke about it a lot at IEM Katawice - he felt EU's top laners actually left them exposed that tournament
[4:13:16] choko97: rumble and vlad vs galio lul
[4:13:21] PortableCorpse: NA is my region, but watching makes me weep sometimes
[4:13:34] CasterFroskurinn: If you want to feel better about NA you came to the right region
[4:13:34] CasterFroskurinn: lol
[4:13:35] Kxmx_Rin: @PortableCorpse England is my city Kappa
[4:13:41] rofflepie: watching NA gives me hope in going pro someday
[4:14:04] weakestlink99: We're underway.
[4:14:04] CasterFroskurinn: I love the CC and dmg threats that Dan's comp has
[4:14:05] PortableCorpse: RIP you
[4:14:13] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn On the topic of teams being bad, why was Vici such a dumpster fire?
[4:14:20] Osteoid: DansGame
[4:14:25] CasterFroskurinn: I don't think JDG have enough dmg to win the game, but they're a better team so they'll probably win through superior coordination.
[4:14:30] Osteoid: C'mon Dan
[4:14:38] choko97: ez red
[4:14:58] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora Vici couldn't figure out what made them good and they played a style completely different than any other team due to their limitations. Bengi's happiness seemed to be a massive issue as well.
[4:15:01] rofflepie: mega leash Kreygasm
[4:15:06] CasterFroskurinn: Gigaleash
[4:15:28] rofflepie: no maokai top for saplings, no giga leash
[4:15:29] Kxmx_Rin: Teraleash? 4Head
[4:15:36] CasterFroskurinn: RiP
[4:15:40] rofflepie: c9 had giga leash today for kayn
[4:16:01] rofflepie: mid lane for raptor, bot lane for red, go blue and there was 2 sapling there too
[4:16:16] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn Do you think another roster change would fix them, or do they just need a strategy revamp?
[4:16:19] weakestlink99: Right now, Vici is 12-1 in the LSPL, leading the league.
[4:16:41] CasterFroskurinn: @satanoidio last I saw they were using Crash in the jungle and are topping the LSPL - so I'd say they're on the right path to promote back into the LPL
[4:17:15] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn
[4:17:36] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora I @ the wrong guy: last I saw they were using Crash in the jungle and are topping the LSPL - so I'd say they're on the right path to promote back into the LPL
[4:18:22] weakestlink99: GT is also looking to go straight back up to the LPL at 10-3.
[4:18:29] rofflepie: its slightly harder to get promoted now though, since there are no more promotions i think only 1 or 2 get in this season
[4:18:34] michaelsund: ?
[4:18:39] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn What do you think are there strengths, is their bot as trash as the memes say?
[4:18:44] rofflepie: no more demotion*
[4:18:48] paperboathat_: *their
[4:19:12] michaelsund: Galio vs Vlad MingLee Bg
[4:19:16] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora I haven't examined the team close enough to analyze them with any real merit or intelligence
[4:20:05] CasterFroskurinn: A lot of my recent focus has been on the LMS and LPL to get more well rounded before worlds; don't have enough time to engage in LSPL.
[4:20:15] PortableCorpse: oh
[4:20:16] choko97: gg easy
[4:20:18] Beetrayn: PogChamp
[4:20:19] rofflepie: dunked for first blood
[4:20:37] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn how about the previous roster, were there any small flashes of brilliance or was it completely unsalvagable?
[4:20:59] paperboathat_: I remember Bengi got trashed on by the ceo
[4:21:06] weakestlink99: This is a disaster for DAN.
[4:21:19] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora I think Loong is underrated and an emotional player. You could tell that moral was low and he was puniched but if he was happy and healthy in a team environement, Easyhoon + Loong + korean jungler was a great base for any team
[4:21:30] PortableCorpse: I haven't had much chance to watch LMS this season, how is Flash Wolves looking? =/
[4:22:08] CasterFroskurinn: FW look great. I think Maple is boosted a lot by Karsa's pathing and attention and isn't actually as good as people give him credit. He's still good, but people talk about maple as if he's Faker or something.
[4:22:16] michaelsund: Lms might aswell be called FW region Kappa
[4:22:30] paperboathat_: LMS doesn't have an English stream right?
[4:22:40] CasterFroskurinn: JTeam got their new top laner and that makes them really scary. If they can patch their vision problems, Jteam are really exciting.
[4:22:40] iamvievie: Woah. Top in bottom and bottom in top?
[4:22:47] weakestlink99: @solairefastora I don't think so.
[4:22:50] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora no english coverage for LPL
[4:22:54] KingJebusTheWise: cmonBruh
[4:22:57] CasterFroskurinn: LMS*
[4:23:02] paarthurnaks61: do you think DAN can comeback from this situation?
[4:23:03] PortableCorpse: LOL
[4:23:16] Beetrayn: LUL remember free first tower trade meta a few years back
[4:23:28] PsycheFI: Jebaited Jebaited Jebaited
[4:23:28] yoooyaaac: WTF
[4:23:29] KingJebusTheWise: Jebaited
[4:23:29] choko97: kabe god
[4:23:33] Ponza: PogChamp
[4:23:35] yoooyaaac: NA CHASE
[4:23:36] michaelsund: Open
[4:23:40] PandanPaisen: ff 15 boys lol
[4:23:40] hotszzz: omg
[4:23:40] WhoKnowsUA: CN dive
[4:23:41] CasterFroskurinn: DAN's team comp doesn't come online till mid game - so there's still hope - but they uh...dont look so hot.
[4:23:44] weakestlink99: @beetrayn Season 5, right.
[4:23:47] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn How's Toyz's team Raise Gaming doing?
[4:23:47] patrik5100: Ez Jebaited
[4:23:48] Ponza: Massive passive
[4:23:48] Vennntil: FINED LUL
[4:23:53] Beetrayn: weakestlink99 yeah I think
[4:24:00] PortableCorpse: At least no one is hard feeding yet
[4:24:06] patrik5100: Big what? :o
[4:24:12] Beetrayn: it was all about scouting wards and lane swaps
[4:24:22] Garrox: big assive
[4:24:24] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora There were a lot of questions if Raise was actually the best LMS team not invited to Rift Rivals, but they thrived when Karsa wasn't on FW and AHQ were struggling.
[4:24:26] Munchinsteaks: im confused what happened to sej ult
[4:24:37] Munchinsteaks: was it doged by the ult?
[4:24:54] rofflepie: JD has better comp mid game anways, galio camille combo destroys single carries, samething as j4 galio, the galio + trap terrain comp is prob lpl's best comp atm
[4:25:02] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn Do you think they're legit, and what are they doing right?
[4:25:03] iamvievie: Rumble's ult was dodged
[4:25:08] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora it's unclear if htey could take down a performing AHQ/FW/and New JTeam. For now they're interesting but there's few games and little tape to tell if Raise go the distance
[4:25:13] iamvievie: Also Sej ult
[4:25:30] michaelsund: TSM wont leave groups EleGiggle
[4:25:32] iamvievie: But what I am asking is top in bottom and bottom in top?
[4:25:41] weakestlink99: @beetrayn I remember that was when I started watching LCK, back when they had about 800 viewers and also casted Hearthstone and team Starcraft. Good times.
[4:25:50] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora I think they play really basic LoL and the LMS meta makes it very easy to set up eveything you want and then execute. But global meta move much faster and AHQ and FW show that they can adapt and change, Raise havent
[4:26:08] Beetrayn: weakestlink99 nice :D
[4:26:25] PortableCorpse: My doggo demands attention brb
[4:26:33] CasterFroskurinn: pet the doggo
[4:26:41] Beetrayn: OhMyDog
[4:26:54] AlisonWunderland: InuyoFace
[4:27:11] rofflepie: skt is sandbagging to not be number 1 seed, cause they know TSM is number 1 seed and wants to play them in groups, but they forgot NA lost their #1 seed at MSI Kappa
[4:27:13] Emi1y_Rose: Pls give the doggo an extra head rub!
[4:27:17] weakestlink99: I guess that I am the only one who thinks doggos are a bit overrated.
[4:27:17] PandanPaisen: raise the puppy KappaHD KappaHD KappaHD KappaHD KappaHD KappaHD KappaHD
[4:27:22] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn What is the LMS meta? Is there an identity to the region, like how the LPL is the team fight region
[4:27:42] CasterFroskurinn: It's interesting how much leeway we give SKT because they're SKT. Rome could actually be burning and we're all standing in it like: this is fine, they'll win worlds!
[4:28:07] PortableCorpse: SKT's performance these past few weeks is really worrying
[4:28:12] PortableCorpse: I want to believe in them, but there
[4:28:14] KingJebusTheWise: TSM will beat SKT at worlds finals this year Kappa
[4:28:15] PandanPaisen: Waiting for my EDG skins
[4:28:17] Beetrayn: there's a little bit of smoke coming from Rome right now at leat
[4:28:20] PortableCorpse: is definitely a lot of big question marks
[4:28:40] Beetrayn: Pocket sand PogChamp
[4:28:40] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora LMS meta is defined by really long lane phases because Junglers are quite green. It means that teams skill gaps in individual pieces are very top heavy because they get to abuse the long time with their opponents. So a lot of victories are decided in the first 15 minutes because some players are just much better than others off of snowball
[4:28:45] weakestlink99: I think SKT probably won't win worlds.
[4:29:20] paperboathat_: Even if SKT manages to not win a game for the rest of the season, everyone still has to give a measure of respect
[4:29:26] rofflepie: no i acutally think SKT is bad now, and has been bad for a while, but teams finally know how to punish them mid game now, SKT been falling behind early for a year now, but they would hold and come back, at msi WE showed that just go hard on them, even if u dont get the perfect engage, and take suboptimal start of fight to force their split pusher to react
[4:29:29] CasterFroskurinn: It also means the vision game is really poor in LMS as a hole - experienced supports like Swordart still have great vision games but that's built by their international experience
[4:29:46] Emi1y_Rose: Man, black "blood" vlad is really badass
[4:29:53] CasterFroskurinn: SKT have a bad read on the bot lane meta and are failing in individual choices across the board.
[4:29:58] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn is that why they usually match up badly internationally?
[4:30:09] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn I mean LMS
[4:30:31] PortableCorpse: I wonder how much is on Kkoma and how much is on Wolf/Bang
[4:30:50] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora I think it's why they take some warmup time for international play. FW and AHQ have a lot of LCK and LPL scrim partners, but they don't learn a lot from their domestic league and change pretty drastically on an international stage
[4:31:01] rofflepie: skt is also too cocky sometimes, they know WE wants galio first pick and didnt care, if they banned galio at RR they prob win
[4:31:01] hyyuann: ??
[4:31:07] weakestlink99: (Insert Esteban from the Suite Life quote here.)
[4:31:09] PandanPaisen: that belt should be getting worn out pretty soon KappaHD KappaHD KappaHD
[4:31:12] Beetrayn: Harold! :)
[4:31:13] rofflepie: but faker was like, lul galio this kid, my cass stomp him
[4:31:23] EZ8_OCE: I think Bang is just having a bad patch in and out of game at the moment. He'll come back stronger once he gets his head in the right place
[4:31:27] yoooyaaac: ZIDANE
[4:31:31] 甜野的小迷妹: tinder Kappa
[4:31:34] Beetrayn: Harold BibleThump
[4:31:38] CasterFroskurinn: Faker's hubris has been plauging him since MSI. His disrespect against G2 when Perkz boddied him in lane was the start
[4:31:42] CasterFroskurinn: and it's gotten worse
[4:31:56] yoooyaaac: BibleThump
[4:31:57] Emi1y_Rose: As much as I don't want SKT to be having a bad time it'd be really exciting to me for a new worlds champion
[4:32:20] PandanPaisen: no more damn skt skins
[4:32:25] 甜野的小迷妹: BibleThump
[4:32:43] EZ8_OCE: @CasterFroskurinn You make a good point about Faker there. It'll be his downfall. I think the whole SKT roster needs to get themselves into a better mental state
[4:32:47] CasterFroskurinn: It makes the global meta so much more exciting. If SKT continue to struggle then it's a scrappy fight for the trophy. Will a korean team still get it? Probably, but the gap doesn't look so wide anymore - at least not right now
[4:32:53] Munchinsteaks: dont worry guys somehow dan will get a baron
[4:32:56] paperboathat_: It's not 100%guaranteed that SKT won't win worlds, it's still probably a solid 30%
[4:32:59] ESTEpo: VoHiYo all how you doing?
[4:33:01] rofflepie: faker also doesnt change how aggresive he plays when peanut is playing, peanut wards less than blank and benji use to, so he has less information to work with but still takes risky trades
[4:33:31] CasterFroskurinn: Faker forces people to play perfect league of legends. And watching enemy mid laners step up and match that is really cool. Faker brings out the best of people or they perish in seconds.
[4:33:52] Vexnya: As nice as the skt skins are we need a new color pallet, the gold and red/blue is getting old
[4:34:00] paperboathat_: Necessity is the greatest motivation
[4:34:13] PortableCorpse: I was so excited for SKT Nami
[4:34:26] CasterFroskurinn: I own all of wolf's skins
[4:34:28] CasterFroskurinn: fucking love that guy
[4:34:28] rofflepie: omg vs tsm finals, black and white skins everywhere
[4:34:35] PortableCorpse: Wolf is a qtpie
[4:34:43] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse I love my SKT Nami skin, Wolf's outdone himself there
[4:34:46] PandanPaisen: Give EDG skins GivePLZ GivePLZ TakeNRG TakeNRG
[4:34:47] CasterFroskurinn: He's just so cool. Great guy and fun personality.
[4:34:51] PortableCorpse: For sure, I love it as well
[4:34:54] PsycheFI: gg
[4:34:58] weakestlink99: @casterfroskurinn Did they make an SKT Ahri skin?
[4:35:00] PortableCorpse: It helps that Nami is my favorite support
[4:35:01] Beetrayn: PulseChamp
[4:35:05] 厉害大王: ez
[4:35:08] Vexnya: Yeah I like wolf he got me into playing nami as my go to aupport
[4:35:09] Beetrayn: PulseChamp sang7
[4:35:21] weakestlink99: Because I thought Faker played her a lot.
[4:35:23] CasterFroskurinn: @weakestlink99 I believe it's Syndra, Ryze, Azir, and Oriana?
[4:35:30] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn do you usually hang around in Twitch. Hat when
[4:35:38] EZ8_OCE: @CasterFroskurinn Do you rofl everytime the chop sticks drop down on the recall too?
[4:35:39] paperboathat_: You're not on cast?
[4:35:45] weakestlink99: Welp rip.
[4:35:46] 布魯斯犬太: poor dan
[4:35:48] Emi1y_Rose: I thought slice and dice was a renekton thing! :P
[4:35:50] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora usually. Even if I'm not talking I'm watching it.
[4:35:59] 布魯斯犬太: BibleThump
[4:36:06] CasterFroskurinn: I'm legit sitting just out of frame in the studio right now on my laptop - about to hop on desk for OMG vs WE
[4:36:16] weakestlink99: DAN just, from start to finish, failed.
[4:36:18] PortableCorpse: Yissss
[4:36:22] PandanPaisen: where iz rusty
[4:36:29] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn cool, it's really nice to be able to chat with an analyst and ask your opinion on things
[4:36:29] CasterFroskurinn: Rusty is sick; he lost his voice
[4:36:37] PortableCorpse: ^
[4:36:37] CasterFroskurinn: that's why I was called in - today was supposed to be my day off.
[4:36:37] PandanPaisen: ah
[4:36:42] rofflepie: there is no skt ori skin, its zed, ori already had a tpa skin
[4:36:44] 布魯斯犬太: GGGGG
[4:36:53] PortableCorpse: Hope to see Frosk at worlds
[4:36:54] CasterFroskurinn: @rofflepie AH yiss the zed ty ty
[4:37:14] Vexnya: Lol i have all the TPA skins and i even kinda forgot they were still a team
[4:37:16] PandanPaisen: urgot skin when
[4:37:25] weakestlink99: @casterfroskurinn Is Dom in the studio today, as well as you and Raz?
[4:37:28] CasterFroskurinn: I want Kkoma to get a ping
[4:37:36] Beetrayn: KKona
[4:37:37] CasterFroskurinn: if they win again - not a ward skin a legit Kkoma ping
[4:37:44] PortableCorpse: The Urgot rework gives me the willies. I do not like it.
[4:37:45] 厉害大王: Jing dong SuperVinlin
[4:37:50] CasterFroskurinn: Dom was in NA for comic con he just landed
[4:38:00] EZ8_OCE: @CasterFroskurinn Like a 'stop that' Ping
[4:38:00] weakestlink99: Ah, okay.
[4:38:07] PortableCorpse: Well, that's not true. I think it's a really cool rework, but his ult just does not agree with me at all.
[4:38:13] PandanPaisen: as in iwilldom dom?
[4:38:13] CasterFroskurinn: @summonerez8 "I will beat you with a belt if you do that" ping
[4:38:21] PandanPaisen: loooool
[4:38:48] rofflepie: galio balanced
[4:38:55] EZ8_OCE: @CasterFroskurinn I would actually love that ping, like the ping animation being an angry Kkoma face :L
[4:38:56] PortableCorpse: I need that ping for my buddy who plays mid lane like he's Faker
[4:39:01] 厉害大王: jingdong * com
[4:39:03] paperboathat_: It should be a ping like one of those hot singles ads
[4:39:03] Vexnya: New urgot is cool but his leg mechanic feels really gimmicky
[4:39:08] Beetrayn: gg
[4:39:19] Envoy_of_the_End: Ggoong got benched already? LUL
[4:39:26] paperboathat_: Kkoma and his marriage pursuits

[4:39:50] Beetrayn: ThankEgg
[4:39:57] weakestlink99: Have fun on the desk, @casterfroskurinn .
[4:40:04] EZ8_OCE: I would enjoy the kkoma ward skin so much more if he actually slapped his forehead when it spawns rather than the little point and wink animation
[4:40:04] CasterFroskurinn: <3
[4:40:07] PandanPaisen: i miss deft and meiko bot qq
[4:40:07] CasterFroskurinn: Cheers guys!
[4:40:14] PortableCorpse: Later, Frosk!
[4:40:16] paperboathat_: Cya Fros!
[4:40:19] Beetrayn: CasterFroskurinn bye sangHehe

[4:41:34] AndyChrist1: the boner aswell
[4:41:47] CasterFroskurinn: that escalated quickly
[4:41:48] weakestlink99: JDG got the win, but they still trail LGD by 3 games in the playoff hunt.
[4:41:49] rofflepie: snake saved JDG's season by gifting them that win
[4:42:19] CasterFroskurinn: HIS PHONE

[4:42:41] EZ8_OCE: Razz get off twitter!!
[4:42:43] Envoy_of_the_End: @CasterFroskurinn produce placement Kappa
[4:42:43] CasterFroskurinn: we have little tables
[4:42:46] paperboathat_: I mean JD saved it for themselves by letting Loken and Xinyi play with both hands finally
[4:42:50] CasterFroskurinn: you can see the water bottle stand
[4:42:50] AndyChrist1: >_<
[4:42:52] CasterFroskurinn: next to pulse
[4:42:55] rofflepie: someone zoom in, and use the reflective surface in the room to analyze whats on that phone
[4:43:02] CasterFroskurinn: ENHANCE
[4:43:19] Envoy_of_the_End: we need camera man to zoom in to see that HTC 4Head
[4:43:27] CasterFroskurinn: Apple scum lord
[4:43:29] paperboathat_: What time is it in China over there?
[4:43:30] ESTEpo: then photoshop and put random fun stuff there PogChamp
[4:43:37] CasterFroskurinn: China is 3 hours behind us
[4:43:39] CasterFroskurinn: so 5:30
[4:43:40] rofflepie: i rmember that scene, they took 5mins to bullshit zoom in and enhance, to find out something they could have just asked
[4:43:51] EZ8_OCE: Maybe Razz just sent a risky text and he's eagerly awaiting the reply
[4:43:57] rofflepie: forgot waht show that was though
[4:43:59] CasterFroskurinn: the never ending "..."
[4:43:59] weakestlink99: @solairefastora It is actually casted from Sydney.

[4:44:22] CasterFroskurinn: I can't
[4:44:24] CasterFroskurinn: :(
[4:44:26] weakestlink99: I wish they could do on-site, though.
[4:44:31] paperboathat_: Oh... it's 2:30 in the morning in the good old Alaskan tundra
[4:44:37] NxE_Elluminate: fdfds
[4:44:39] CasterFroskurinn: I respect that
[4:44:48] AndyChrist1: @CasterFroskurinn 1st thing u need to do is speak chinese :o
[4:44:50] NxE_Elluminate: @CasterFroskurinn what rank are you?
[4:44:53] Envoy_of_the_End: u're not in China right now Frosk?
[4:44:57] CasterFroskurinn: Diamond V

[4:45:54] cantspeel: LETS GET EM
[4:45:56] CasterFroskurinn: I tried to get Spawn and Deficio to boost me at worlds
[4:45:59] weakestlink99: Did you know that about 1 in 80 people are Diamond V.
[4:45:59] CasterFroskurinn: THOSE GUYS
[4:46:01] CasterFroskurinn: FEED
[4:46:04] michaelsund: TheThing
[4:46:05] rofflepie: what happenf to that chinese team u were coaching frosk
[4:46:12] Envoy_of_the_End: @CasterFroskurinn deficio wash up, Kobe still got it LUL
[4:46:17] AndyChrist1: ahhh, I thought u were sent to China as punishment
[4:46:23] PortableCorpse: I feed
[4:46:28] EZ8_OCE: With Spawns AD Alistar hoe could he not
[4:46:31] PortableCorpse: my ADC kills
[4:46:34] CasterFroskurinn: I was promoted to head coach - didn't want to be head coach, so I told them to hire LS. And they failed NACS
[4:46:39] rofflepie: frosk wish she got sent to china, chinese casters makes millions a year
[4:46:48] CasterFroskurinn: ^^^
[4:46:57] CasterFroskurinn: Vincent and Remember making that bank
[4:47:05] Envoy_of_the_End: @CasterFroskurinn wait you're with TempoStorm now?
[4:47:17] CasterFroskurinn: No. This was my chinese/NA team
[4:47:25] Envoy_of_the_End: PogChamp
[4:47:26] CasterFroskurinn: Roar
[4:47:27] ESTEpo: Congrotolations reaching ND5, how are your weeb lvls going? VoHiYo
[4:47:39] Envoy_of_the_End: oh the one that Chaox was coaching way back in the days
[4:47:43] rofflepie: was chaox adc on that team, or was that another team
[4:47:49] CasterFroskurinn: He was the adc
[4:47:53] Envoy_of_the_End: o
[4:48:00] PortableCorpse: I'm minoring in Japanese, where does that put my weeb levels?
[4:48:05] CasterFroskurinn: Phasekiller, Inori, Spicey, Chaox, and Remi
[4:48:09] EZ8_OCE: Sitting here in my first season of lol like I'll never rank that high BibleThump
[4:48:26] rofflepie: depends on how much anime u watch and how familiar u r with seiyuus
[4:48:28] weakestlink99: @rofflepie I though the big prize money was the 120万 RMB for the winners.
[4:48:38] michaelsund: Starting in s7 WutFace
[4:48:43] PortableCorpse: I watch animu occasionally, and I know roughly none
[4:48:51] rofflepie: in china tournament winning is very small amount of the ecosystem
[4:48:58] Timeluser: who won?
[4:48:59] weakestlink99: Ah.
[4:49:00] Envoy_of_the_End: Remi permabanned me cause i made Prototype salty FeelsBadMan
[4:49:08] rofflepie: the real money is stream, ad, sponsership
[4:49:11] RustyTheCaster: ads DansGame
[4:49:13] weakestlink99: @timeluser JGD
[4:49:16] EZ8_OCE: @tozzi_fan It's legitimately difficult haha, but progress is being made
[4:49:19] Timeluser: thk
[4:49:29] PortableCorpse: I wanted to take Korean but my university's Korean program is uh... lackluster
[4:49:32] rofflepie: salary is high too but u make more streaming than say, marin in LGD
[4:49:40] nguyenvu1: Lgd vs ss Who won?
[4:49:54] grimrevolution: ss
[4:50:08] weakestlink99: @portablecorpse You're lucky. OSU doesn't offer Korean.
[4:50:09] EZ8_OCE: Has anyone tried those HP and MP drinks?
[4:50:29] PortableCorpse: Our program is literally like one Korean lady that teaches elementary Korean 1&2 and that's all
[4:50:46] PortableCorpse: MY ADVISOR DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT EXISTED
[4:50:47] rofflepie: like there is a girl called feng teemo that stream on douyu, she sucks in league but she is cute and sings a lot on stream too, so she get more than 1 million rmb a month
[4:51:16] Lev1athanGRE: vmao lmao
[4:51:33] michaelsund: WutFace
[4:51:49] EZ8_OCE: I'd probably rather watch her than Tyler
[4:52:00] PortableCorpse: same, sommonerez8
[4:52:09] PortableCorpse: please excuse my spellikng.
[4:52:15] PortableCorpse: I give up.
[4:52:22] rofflepie: its not just watching, there is a weird fuerdai culture of competition
[4:52:37] rofflepie: so when one person buys a rocket "donate money basically" someone else would one up them and get 2
[4:52:44] PortableCorpse: WAIT, EZ8 as in 08th MS team?
[4:52:49] rofflepie: and chat would explode in the hype
[4:52:55] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse all g, the summoner is only there because my name is too short for twitch haha
[4:53:03] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse EXACTLY!
[4:53:06] weakestlink99: @rofflepie Wow.
[4:53:10] EZ8_OCE: someone gets it!!!!!!\
[4:53:13] PortableCorpse: HELL YEAH DUDE
[4:53:23] PortableCorpse: My favorite UC series by far
[4:53:37] weakestlink99: @rofflepie How much per rocket does a person get?
[4:53:39] AndyChrist1: Kreygasm
[4:53:54] EZ8_OCE: That legitimately made my day and yeah same I've watched it i dont even know how many times @PortableCorpse
[4:54:09] Envoy_of_the_End: cheerleader PogChamp
[4:54:09] PortableCorpse: I've been considering rewatching it soon
[4:54:16] AndyChrist1: CheerLeaders Kreygasm
[4:54:25] Envoy_of_the_End: when are we getting some cheerleader in NALCS SwiftRage
[4:54:27] rofflepie: rocket is 500, not sure how much cut the streamer get
[4:54:37] EZ8_OCE: Same, I'm currently being a sappy weeb and rewatching Seed
[4:54:40] weakestlink99: 500 RMB?
[4:54:46] rofflepie: yes
[4:54:49] winternap1: league of legends in 2017
[4:54:50] PortableCorpse: I've never watched Seed, is it worth a watch?
[4:54:52] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 gundam seed? PogChamp
[4:54:52] EZ8_OCE: The fights are ridic though so worth
[4:55:01] EZ8_OCE: Gundam seed yup
[4:55:06] weakestlink99: I'm done.
[4:55:11] winternap1: i just tuned in wtf is going on
[4:55:21] Envoy_of_the_End: Jesus Yamato is the best, never have to worry about him
[4:55:23] RustyTheCaster: get it cheerleaders
[4:55:24] RustyTheCaster: get it
[4:55:26] PortableCorpse: Wait, how much is 500RMB?
[4:55:29] EZ8_OCE: I'd watch it, it;s quite different to UC but worth the watch
[4:55:38] weakestlink99: Like 70 USD
[4:55:43] rofflepie: seed was my fav anime, envethough hardcore gundam fans hate it cause its too soap opera, but lacus is my childhood goddess
[4:55:46] PortableCorpse: Um what
[4:55:51] PortableCorpse: WutFace
[4:55:52] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 you should try Heroic Age if you like Seed
[4:55:59] AndyChrist1: dafuq
[4:56:00] weakestlink99: No joke, dude.
[4:56:01] rofflepie: 500 rmb is 80 90ish US i think?
[4:56:10] EZ8_OCE: Is that the one with the beg kinda dragony looking mecha?
[4:56:12] 厉害大王: 6.76 USD=1 RMB
[4:56:23] rofflepie: otherway around
[4:56:27] weakestlink99: @rofflepie That's probably more right.
[4:56:28] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 hm the mech is more organic
[4:56:32] 厉害大王: 6.76 RMB=1 USD
[4:56:49] MirinStatus: mic muted LUL
[4:56:54] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 but the story pace is kind of similar to Seed
[4:57:12] Envoy_of_the_End: Frosk just TP from chat DansGame
[4:57:18] EZ8_OCE: @Envoy_of_the_End I've watched pretty much every Gundam they released except build fighters coz... well no explanation needed there haha
[4:57:28] rofflepie: gundam seed does have the best mecha in all of the gundam tohugh, even hardcore fans agree
[4:57:34] EZ8_OCE: @Envoy_of_the_End I'll check out heroic age, sounds interesting
[4:57:38] 你可以叫我鸭兄: 500 RMB= 73.8956 USD This is today's exchange rate
[4:57:43] cantspeel: twitch shoutouts
[4:57:46] PortableCorpse: I disagree
[4:57:54] PortableCorpse: but Zaku is life so
[4:57:57] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 lol yea i like a romance plot in Seed, didn't watch much of 00 cause it seem to lack that
[4:58:02] EZ8_OCE: @rofflepie they're like so ridiculously strong compared to any other timeline lol
[4:58:09] MisakiKureha: gundam 00 VoHiYo
[4:58:19] PortableCorpse: Gundam X
[4:58:20] rofflepie: no they are not though, OP wise they have nothing on turn A
[4:58:26] Envoy_of_the_End: @rofflepie yea i dont like these new gundam design that i see in Iron Blooded Orphan
[4:58:38] Envoy_of_the_End: @rofflepie the leg and feet look odd
[4:58:43] EZ8_OCE: 00 I really enjoyed for the idea of the storyline it's so different to the other Gundam timelines
[4:58:48] rofflepie: i think someone did a acutal OPness of gundams, strike freedom broke top 5 barely, top 4 is all turn A and x and unicorn
[4:59:09] PortableCorpse: I have a few series I need to rewatch
[4:59:17] Envoy_of_the_End: i feel like Akatsuki would be pretty OP in the right hand
[4:59:20] PortableCorpse: I remember IGLOO fondly, but I'm afraid the CG may not have fared well
[4:59:21] EZ8_OCE: Unicorn with NTD active is just broken
[4:59:27] Envoy_of_the_End: that shit deflect all beams
[4:59:47] rofflepie: turn A is like planet destoyer lvl though
[4:59:53] EZ8_OCE: honestly would like to see a full blown Gundam series in CG
[5:00:02] PortableCorpse: MS IGLOO
[5:00:23] weakestlink99: I wonder if someone translates the chat like Inven does for LCK.
[5:00:29] EZ8_OCE: I love IGLOO but it was kinda short and like snippets of the war is all
[5:00:37] PortableCorpse: Yeah
[5:00:54] PortableCorpse: But yeah, you're not wrong
[5:00:56] EZ8_OCE: Like if they remade say ZZ or even the original MSG in CG I would cry haha
[5:01:11] PortableCorpse: I'd love to see bandai take another shot at a gundam MMO
[5:01:43] EZ8_OCE: That game upset me haha, it looked so cool but I could not get it to work in NZ. I think it was region locked to KR>
[5:02:01] PortableCorpse: UCGO had so much potential... :(
[5:02:07] rofflepie: i think old shows are good for its time, but if u use the same story now it would seem very rudimentary, i rewatched gundam 79 a while back, and the story seemed so stupid that time around
[5:02:15] Envoy_of_the_End: I just wish Konami/Kojima release ZoE 3 FeelsBadMan i feel like a gundam pilot when i played that game
[5:02:28] rofflepie: someone show up, oh no them died oh well, next
[5:03:11] EZ8_OCE: Anyone else think it would be much cooler releasing a battlefield style Gundam game to the world rather than dynasty warriors style games?
[5:03:14] weakestlink99: Any predictions for this series?
[5:03:18] rofflepie: no galio?
[5:03:21] cantspeel: WE!!
[5:03:25] EZ8_OCE: WE 2-0
[5:03:30] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 maybe Titanfall style?
[5:03:30] grimrevolution: WE
[5:03:31] michaelsund: Omg 2 0 TheThing
[5:03:31] rofflepie: OMG goon goof
[5:03:40] rofflepie: galio is WE's best champ atm
[5:03:41] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 bigger scale obviously
[5:03:46] PortableCorpse: Wild guess: WE 2-1
[5:03:52] weakestlink99: I say OMG 2:1.
[5:03:56] MisakiKureha: @summonerez8 Did you try VPN Gateway I played U.S and Japan region locked games with that
[5:03:57] deadcarnie: OMG 2:0
[5:03:59] rofflepie: WE 2-0
[5:04:11] MisakiKureha: OMG 2:1 VoHiYo
[5:04:21] michaelsund: TehePelo
[5:04:27] EZ8_OCE: @Envoy_of_the_End yeah that would be cool. There was a guy developing a Gundam simulator a while ago I think still ging but very slow progress
[5:04:44] PortableCorpse: rayLove
[5:04:51] EZ8_OCE: @MisakiKureha I tried but I couldn't really get it to work, may also have given my last computer aids lol
[5:04:55] rofflepie: there are 40 on 40 gudnam games
[5:05:02] rofflepie: i played it a while back but forgot waht it was called
[5:05:15] PortableCorpse: Mobile Suit Gundam Online ?
[5:05:18] rofflepie: u also have a commander on both side but I never figured out what to do as a commander
[5:05:23] deadcarnie: go play mech assuaalt with the 150 button controller you need
[5:05:24] EZ8_OCE: I heard of a game called operation Troy back on PS2 which looked cool but before my time
[5:06:00] deadcarnie: game cost 50$ the controller is 150$
[5:06:01] PortableCorpse: There were lots of neat Gundam games on PS2
[5:06:22] EZ8_OCE: Yeah there was one set in the Wing timeline that I played when I was like 10 lol
[5:06:29] EZ8_OCE: so much fun
[5:06:46] PortableCorpse: I softmodded my PS2 to play those games
[5:06:53] PortableCorpse: because they're impossible to find here :(
[5:06:58] MisakiKureha: I was sad that they started and abandoned a game project with a name TSF Forefront, not really a mecha fun but its a muv luv eclipse universe based pc game seemed so good but they will never finish it PuinOko
[5:07:10] MisakiKureha: PunOko
[5:07:15] Envoy_of_the_End: @PortableCorpse couldnt you just get ps2 emulator and download them?
[5:07:18] rofflepie: my fav gudam game is still the original gundam vs gundam style games, if u like seed play Gundam Seed: Rengou vs. Z.A.F.T.
[5:07:24] rofflepie: its on ps2
[5:07:38] PortableCorpse: brb
[5:07:46] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse sad thing is now that region locking for consoles is pretty much dead, there's just not as much coming out from the gundam side of things
[5:07:59] rofflepie: ps2 emulator are everywhere now
[5:08:03] Envoy_of_the_End: yea
[5:08:11] Envoy_of_the_End: i had a perfect emu like 7 years ago
[5:08:27] Envoy_of_the_End: nowaday it should be even smoother
[5:08:33] MisakiKureha: Is it true that you can play persona 5 with a ps3 emulkator now? :O
[5:08:44] rofflepie: there is a new ps3/ps4 gundam vs gundam game 2 years ago
[5:08:48] Envoy_of_the_End: ps3 emu might be a while
[5:09:00] Envoy_of_the_End: let see if there's one
[5:09:18] Osteoid: WE VoHiYo
[5:09:26] MisakiKureha: theres a pcps3 or something like that
[5:09:30] EZ8_OCE: If frosk saw this chat haha, all Gundam no league :L
[5:09:32] rofflepie: who is WE top, i missed pick ban
[5:09:34] Envoy_of_the_End: cause i read a while back that
[5:09:49] Envoy_of_the_End: in order for a pc to emulate a console, it have to be like 10x more powerful
[5:09:49] PortableCorpse: At the time, Envoy, my PC would literally explode trying to emulate PS2 games
[5:09:51] EZ8_OCE: 957 on Camille
[5:09:51] rofflepie: oh gg, camille galio comp
[5:10:05] Envoy_of_the_End: @PortableCorpse ah, have u tried it again lately?
[5:10:12] PortableCorpse: I have
[5:10:22] rofflepie: there was a guy arguing with me yesterday how camille is anti synergy with galio was like lul
[5:10:30] PortableCorpse: I'm on a much more powerful PC now so it isn't an issue
[5:10:54] rofflepie: hmm mega leash for omg
[5:11:08] Envoy_of_the_End: @PortableCorpse ah, yea ps2 is like one of the best emu, so many good games on that console lol
[5:11:26] michaelsund: Ps2 masterrace DatSheffy
[5:11:35] Envoy_of_the_End: i need a wii emu so i can play pikmin too
[5:11:45] PortableCorpse: I feel like that era was like a golden era for gaming on consoles...
[5:11:53] PortableCorpse: but maybe that's just rose tinted goggles
[5:12:02] Envoy_of_the_End: it is
[5:12:11] Envoy_of_the_End: lots of original IP
[5:12:45] EZ8_OCE: tbh I have some extremely fond memories of PS1 games that I would definitely play again
[5:13:05] EZ8_OCE: Digimon world 2003 anyone?
[5:13:15] rofflepie: i have a weird fond memory of snes games, and i would go back and play once in a while, like chrono trigger
[5:13:19] michaelsund: Gran Turismo 2 Kreygasm
[5:13:44] PortableCorpse: I always wanted to play the digimon games :(
[5:14:16] EZ8_OCE: Digimon world 2003 on PS1 was probably my favourite ever
[5:14:27] Envoy_of_the_End: apparently persona 5 is not 100% playable yet on ps3 emu
[5:14:32] EZ8_OCE: Theres also an NDS version thats an easy emu on pc
[5:14:39] Envoy_of_the_End: maybe soon
[5:14:41] rofflepie: my fav game on ps1 was the monster rancher games
[5:14:43] PortableCorpse: oh nice
[5:14:56] rofflepie: i would go to the library to borrow random cd to go home and summon monsters
[5:15:00] Envoy_of_the_End: @rofflepie oh that game was fun lol, i got Pheonix a few times too bad it doesn't last that long
[5:15:18] TheDaydreaminOne: i want to play persona 5 :( i can emu the ps3 version but it feels like alpha/beta
[5:15:31] PortableCorpse: Speaking of Phoenix, I need to make some time to play the Phoenix Wright games
[5:15:47] TheDaydreaminOne: true
[5:15:52] Envoy_of_the_End: is there a stable Wii emulator yet?
[5:15:55] TheDaydreaminOne: the movie was strange
[5:16:07] TheDaydreaminOne: ehm ya
[5:16:37] Envoy_of_the_End: i wanna play Pikmin 1 and 2 again
[5:16:48] EZ8_OCE: Sad thing is I find LoL usually takes priority over my other games. Still gotta spend a weekend playing mount and blade here and there though
[5:17:06] TheDaydreaminOne: i play zelda botw with CEmu v1.7.4d
[5:17:16] rofflepie: jsut be like apdo, get to rank 1 so u dont have to log in again
[5:17:23] rofflepie: and paly all ur other games after
[5:17:52] Envoy_of_the_End: @BehindTheLeaves oh nice
[5:18:10] EZ8_OCE: haha true, I just need to get good first
[5:18:18] EZ8_OCE: S7 is my season 1
[5:18:20] TheDaydreaminOne: but to play with 60+ fps u need rly good pc
[5:18:28] EZ8_OCE: well end of season 6
[5:18:32] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 or juts be like me, get to gold v and retire for the season
[5:18:33] TheDaydreaminOne: im around 30 and sometimes it stutters
[5:18:41] TheDaydreaminOne: but over all it works fine
[5:19:03] imSeven: OMG WE SUCK
[5:19:08] EZ8_OCE: @Envoy_of_the_End gold is my goal this season, If I can do that I'll be happy
[5:19:13] Envoy_of_the_End: @BehindTheLeaves also need a 144hz monitor too
[5:19:18] EZ8_OCE: what region are you gold in?
[5:19:22] Envoy_of_the_End: NA
[5:19:29] imSeven: where are the "omg we" memes?
[5:19:47] reedemerofna: why does jhin have dorans ring?
[5:19:50] TheDaydreaminOne: bayonetta runs way better dunno why ... i mean its way faster playstyle n stuff
[5:19:54] EZ8_OCE: @Envoy_of_the_End That's probably harder than mine haha I'm OCE
[5:19:59] rofflepie: remember chaox calling the winner for IPL5
[5:20:01] Envoy_of_the_End: @reedemerofna it's a korean thing that apparently is better than dblade
[5:20:03] TheDaydreaminOne: guess the openworld is the prob with zelda emu
[5:20:06] rofflepie: "WE will win IPL5"
[5:20:37] imSeven: OMG WE LOSE
[5:20:42] Envoy_of_the_End: @summonerez8 probably not much different at gold and silver
[5:21:15] TheDaydreaminOne: and i dont have a 144 monitor
[5:21:16] EZ8_OCE: Oh right is once you start getting into like plat, master etc where the gap opens?
[5:21:44] grimrevolution: Jhin has a ring cause Tahm proposed
[5:21:50] grimrevolution: It was very beautiful
[5:22:01] grimrevolution: A lovely moment for sure
[5:22:30] TheDaydreaminOne: lol i never saw a jhin doran start
[5:22:32] rofflepie: biggest gap is prob diamond 2 to low challenger, cause those u can easily get matched in the same game, and the skill diff between those is prob like diamond to silver
[5:23:21] TheDaydreaminOne: u should also try to avoid the times all the lcs guys (pros in general) play
[5:23:22] rofflepie: deft does doran 2 pot in solo q now, it allows u to do something with raptor lvl 1 or something
[5:23:29] EZ8_OCE: True, the player pool is a hell of a lot smaller up there I guess. Looks like I've got some work to do
[5:24:06] sddhz: SeemsGood
[5:24:36] EZ8_OCE: If you're serious about hard climbing is the pro guides route worth going down or?
[5:25:24] rofflepie: if u wanna climb, figure out waht style works for u waht doesnt, and admit it when u cant play certain champs and stick with what u r good at, and focus on cs
[5:25:28] TheDaydreaminOne: ask darshan, he climbed from silver and now hes pro :P
[5:25:46] rofflepie: some people are naturally fighter in lane, some ppl like to trade farm in peace, figure out ur style
[5:25:55] michaelsund: WE drafted 3 losing lanes and they lose PogChamp no way MingLee
[5:25:57] TheDaydreaminOne: but most important thing is to learn cs
[5:26:23] grimrevolution: And a champ that works for you is pretty imprortant
[5:26:43] rofflepie: some people wants to kill ppl whenever they can, flash engage anytime they can, pick champs that works like that, u cant pick ori and look to solo kill everyone
[5:27:00] TheDaydreaminOne: ya if u can cs out ur opponent u can do small misttakes cuz u scale him out with items
[5:27:08] roll1ng1: lul
[5:27:16] EZ8_OCE: I main support, I've started to find a couple of champs I like So I guess that's something. Just hard to have a massvie influence with some supp champs
[5:27:46] MirinStatus: back in the day you had to know how to play at least 2 to 3 champs for each role, now with the how the picking system is, you can get away with 1 tricking much easier
[5:27:52] TheDaydreaminOne: at the moment braum, kench and leona are supps that work in every league
[5:28:02] TheDaydreaminOne: and not hard to learn/handle
[5:28:04] michaelsund: Blitz is the best support
[5:28:14] rofflepie: support play style changes too much in differnt elo to give general advice, high elo is all about warding and roaming mid, low elo is about hitting ur skill shots and poking ppl out of lane
[5:28:18] michaelsund: Hes the solo q king
[5:28:37] TheDaydreaminOne: nah
[5:28:51] TheDaydreaminOne: leona lvl 18 u can stun every 3sec or somethin
[5:29:02] daddymoch: how do you mute the female caster?
[5:29:17] EZ8_OCE: I've been spamming Nami lately, just lots of sustain and poke. I need to practice my Leona though
[5:29:21] Envoy_of_the_End: welp im out, c yall, I enjoy these civilized discussion SeemsGood
[5:29:22] PortableCorpse: Had to step out for a bit. Have I missed anything exciting?
[5:29:27] PortableCorpse: Later, Envoy
[5:29:42] TheDaydreaminOne: imho for climb are tanksupps better
[5:29:43] michaelsund: @behindtheleaves have fun playing midlane vs mobis blitz
[5:30:11] TheDaydreaminOne: blitz (for me) is the champ i nearly have 0 probs to play against
[5:30:19] rofflepie: blitz is good in solo q cause vision are lacking a lot of time, and 1 pick mid game = win even if u r super behind
[5:30:21] TheDaydreaminOne: morgana way more harder for me
[5:30:36] EZ8_OCE: I guess a pool of say Blitz Leona Braum and Kench I'll be doing okay
[5:30:57] TheDaydreaminOne: ye
[5:31:05] KappaFrankerZXD: that flash was so bad lmao
[5:31:14] TheDaydreaminOne: seju also good
[5:31:19] rofflepie: learn 1 strong mage laner, else u'll hit a skill ceiling when u start playing ppl that knows to counter pick u with zyra all day
[5:31:28] EZ8_OCE: I honestly have hard time laning into Bard a lot of the time. Worth learning him?
[5:31:36] Sk82478: wow is this really twitch chat lol?
[5:31:43] michaelsund: MingLee MingLee MingLee MingLee MingLee MingLee
[5:31:46] Littering_Nd: No
[5:31:52] PortableCorpse: no, Sk8. You've stepped in to bizarro twitch
[5:31:54] Sk82478: love**
[5:31:58] TheDaydreaminOne: i always try to go sona vs bard
[5:31:59] Sk82478: lmao
[5:32:04] rofflepie: bard is ok, there is stronger picks in solo q atm, lots of bard kit is team based best for competitive
[5:32:06] PortableCorpse: Bard is a lot of fun to play, but you can very quickly fuck your team over with him.
[5:32:08] TheDaydreaminOne: works fine for me
[5:32:09] EZ8_OCE: I've got mastery 6 Zyra that I'm pretty comfortable on
[5:32:30] TheDaydreaminOne: zyra is nice
[5:32:34] Sk82478: I duo with a sup and zyra has been great for him lately
[5:32:41] TheDaydreaminOne: poke like hell, cc
[5:32:53] Sk82478: so much poke just win lane and snowball
[5:33:07] grimrevolution: I'm just glad MF isn't an insta-lock support anymore
[5:33:14] EZ8_OCE: tbh, in low elo I've been having a really easy time doing work with Malzahar, at least in normals
[5:33:17] rofflepie: if u really want to be good at support, u should learn thresh, it has a pretty easy learning curve dispite waht ppl think, but very hard to master so u r always getting better at it, and the kit will carry u all the way to challenger if u r good enough
[5:33:24] TheDaydreaminOne: ya and if u e ur plants u can stop a gank pretty good
[5:33:25] Sk82478: set up a noce stranglethorns with a bunch of plants and carry laet game team fights
[5:33:28] michaelsund: But Zyra midgame is really weak compared to melee supports
[5:33:55] michaelsund: She just ints if slightly out of position
[5:34:01] EZ8_OCE: @tozzi_fan You're right I do find I fall off real hard mid game as Zyra if I don't hard snowball early
[5:34:12] areallynicehotdog: all the champs everyones talked about so far are good for solo q
[5:34:12] Sk82478: @rofflepie I agree when my buddy started maining thresh overall his sup play got a lot better
[5:34:42] EZ8_OCE: Might have to start spamming Thresh, I've only played him a little bit
[5:34:48] areallynicehotdog: you just gotta find your playstyle with support
[5:34:56] grimrevolution: You should. He's a fun champ to play
[5:35:03] Sk82478: Very true @tozzi_fan u really just look to set up a nice ult late game or find picks that's it
[5:35:12] TheDaydreaminOne: tresh is highly skillbased
[5:35:13] JaimeeeK: geez idk about that ult
[5:35:14] grimrevolution: And you feel like you have a lot more impact than other champs
[5:35:22] PortableCorpse: To be fair
[5:35:31] michaelsund: Thresh is as cheesy as blitz
[5:35:35] JaimeeeK: sush skillshots NotLikeThis
[5:35:43] grimrevolution: But he's classy cheese
[5:35:45] areallynicehotdog: thresh has more utility tho
[5:35:53] PortableCorpse: ^
[5:35:57] grimrevolution: The smelliest of cheeses
[5:36:00] KappaFrankerZXD: thresh is the worst support in the game
[5:36:04] EZ8_OCE: @BehindTheLeaves Yeah I've found that the first few times I've played Thresh. Good to build real skill on I guess?
[5:36:04] Sk82478: classy cheese Kappa
[5:36:07] daddymoch: im the best thresh awake right now
[5:36:14] daddymoch: prove me wrong
[5:36:14] areallynicehotdog: thats false
[5:36:19] michaelsund: Flash Flay + lantern for the jungler= huge counterplay
[5:36:29] Sk82478: lol theres that twitch chat talk
[5:36:30] daddymoch: @areallynicehotdog what rank are you
[5:36:31] areallynicehotdog: theres way worse supports than thresh
[5:37:03] EZ8_OCE: I had someone supp me with a Nidalee. I did not like that lol
[5:37:09] areallynicehotdog: relax i was talking to kappafrankerz
[5:37:09] TheDaydreaminOne: @summonerez8 true!
[5:37:17] Sk82478: lol
[5:37:26] Sk82478: but she heals
[5:37:28] 칸트ㆍ: hey
[5:37:35] 칸트ㆍ: who won? lgb vs ss?
[5:37:36] TheDaydreaminOne: but imho its worth to have an eye on taric right now. with the changes ... will see
[5:37:37] KappaFrankerZXD: thresh is the worst champion in league of legends
[5:37:44] 칸트ㆍ: ss won?
[5:37:46] grimrevolution: ss won
[5:37:51] 칸트ㆍ: thx
[5:38:06] michaelsund: Thresh is the second best soloq support. You probably have no arms :/
[5:38:12] EZ8_OCE: @BehindTheLeaves Had my first game of Taric today. We won but I wouldn't say I did really well haha
[5:38:15] grimrevolution: Best support champ = Veigar if we're ranking by cheese value
[5:38:42] Sk82478: @BehindTheLeaves I agree I really feel like taric is on the verge of becoming big. his ult is gamebreaking and his stun is a lot easier to hit late game when u have a bunch of tanks just bouncing off each other in team fights
[5:39:00] TheDaydreaminOne: absolut true
[5:39:06] KappaFrankerZXD: if u want a hook champ play blitzcrank, thresh is the worst support in the game, and also the worst hcampion
[5:39:16] Sk82478: lol
[5:39:18] TheDaydreaminOne: btw .. lost a game vs ap lucian yesterday
[5:39:27] TheDaydreaminOne: sh!tload of dmg
[5:39:27] Sk82478: hyperbolic much?
[5:39:30] grimrevolution: There's only 5 kills in this game what is this nonsense
[5:39:33] haveyouseenmybearfaker: grill WutFace
[5:39:41] grimrevolution: There lies Naut, forgotten again
[5:39:46] grimrevolution: Crying in the corner
[5:39:49] Sk82478: twitch chat more interesting than game lukl
[5:39:54] 伊哭: WE is champion！！！
[5:39:58] PortableCorpse: Nami is objectively the best champion in the game? She's a mermaid, she has CC for days, and her laugh spam is top tier.
[5:39:59] gaypuppyboy: u right
[5:40:14] michaelsund: Nami late game is LUL
[5:40:14] gaypuppyboy: and, she puts boots on her head
[5:40:22] haveyouseenmybearfaker: @portablecorpse and she has her own drake
[5:40:24] Sk82478: @PortableCorpse tot tier analysis
[5:40:35] PortableCorpse: thanks, Sk8
[5:40:43] grimrevolution: I take your mermaid and raise you hamster
[5:40:56] grimrevolution: Teemo is clearly the best champion
[5:41:00] Sk82478: I raise u a cowbell
[5:41:01] gaypuppyboy: you talkin gnar? or teemo
[5:41:01] grimrevolution: At making people hate you
[5:41:04] Sk82478: more cowbell
[5:41:13] gaypuppyboy: ill raise you a scissorleg
[5:41:18] grimrevolution: Fuck the cowbell
[5:41:19] PortableCorpse: I mean, Alistar's cowbell is also top tier
[5:41:26] Sk82478: lol
[5:41:30] grimrevolution: I have been proven wrong the cowbell is superior
[5:41:37] gaypuppyboy: casters talk about the cowbell
[5:41:57] PortableCorpse: I miss Nami getting picked a bunch
[5:42:08] michaelsund: This WE aram comp..
[5:42:08] KappaFrankerZXD: lol mystic
[5:42:09] Sk82478: cowbell is cross generation I said more cowbell at work the other day and had some of the old heads rolling
[5:42:15] grimrevolution: You could have moocow, tahm, twitch, and river spirit nami on a team and make a band
[5:42:19] Shijiazhuang: BEN LUL
[5:42:28] PortableCorpse: Yessssss
[5:42:35] Sk82478: hell yeah @grimrevolution
[5:42:38] KappaFrankerZXD: putting smlz on jhin when he is like the best mechanical ad in the league
[5:42:40] PortableCorpse: Tahm Kench is really fun to play, too
[5:42:42] KappaFrankerZXD: LUL
[5:42:51] haveyouseenmybearfaker: yeah only people like 28 and up get it when I say more cowbell lol
[5:42:52] michaelsund: Rumble is overrated
[5:42:52] gaypuppyboy: youre forgetting about bard bard hello
[5:43:01] PortableCorpse: Bard bard. PogChamp
[5:43:07] grimrevolution: FUCK
[5:43:10] EZ8_OCE: I've been playing Nami for like the last week or so haah lvl1-5 in a couple days. Her kit is good for laning but you don't feel hugely relevant late game except for the bubble
[5:43:16] gaypuppyboy: hes the REAL band member
[5:43:26] PortableCorpse: Nami is the only champion I have mastery 7 on
[5:43:27] EZ8_OCE: I'm probably missing something though lol
[5:43:30] grimrevolution: Shit man fuck I am a SHAM
[5:43:31] PortableCorpse: I do not regret taking my ADC's kills at all.
[5:43:44] gaypuppyboy: i got lux morg n sona 7, raka almost there
[5:43:45] haveyouseenmybearfaker: nami on aram is pretty fun lol
[5:43:47] 伊哭: what is the mean of lul？

[5:44:36] EZ8_OCE: hahhaa @PortableCorpse I have mastery 5 after about 5 days , I feel like I get more kills on Malzahar though lol

[5:46:32] nerobotas: @Timmmmmm69 kappa
[5:46:47] PortableCorpse: Alright boys

[5:47:02] grimrevolution: Alistar, pugmaw, twitch, nami for Animal Planet teamcomp
[5:47:17] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse He's goodish but more for late game teamfighting and first couple levels of laning
[5:47:17] PortableCorpse: 🤔
[5:47:25] haveyouseenmybearfaker: no nidalee?
[5:47:32] PortableCorpse: But what about Skarner? He's a scorpion
[5:47:41] grimrevolution: Only if she stays completely as a cat

[5:48:14] grimrevolution: I dig it
[5:48:15] PortableCorpse: He's a pokemon

[5:48:35] haveyouseenmybearfaker: skarner is diglett confirmed
[5:48:44] 伊哭: so why you write it lul？

[5:49:13] grimrevolution: So what is the truth
[5:49:15] PortableCorpse: 🤔
[5:49:24] PortableCorpse: Rek'Sai is a qtpie
[5:49:30] grimrevolution: Rek'sai and Skarner fight for alpha diglette
[5:50:09] fancheng: Lpl最菜洗液
[5:50:09] PortableCorpse: Would Teemo also be a pokemon? Devil Rat?
[5:50:15] Sk82478: or rek sai skarner and malphite make DUG TRIO
[5:50:24] PortableCorpse: I like it, Sk8
[5:50:42] rofflepie: frosk is wrong though, that draft is exactly waht WE wanted, other team doesnt realize WE would pick galio over anything atm, inclduing zac
[5:50:49] haveyouseenmybearfaker: skarner kabutops?
[5:50:50] Sk82478: well kennen is pikachu
[5:50:51] grimrevolution: Teemo is more... like if you could make a legendary horror pokemon
[5:51:08] grimrevolution: Dug trio is goo, this is excellent
[5:51:08] PortableCorpse: Sk8
[5:51:17] Sk82478: yo
[5:51:18] PortableCorpse: I didn't think about that. Kennen is almost literally Pikachu.k
[5:51:23] dan_kweed: It's not exactly his hair that bothers me, but it just clashes so much with his baby face
[5:51:27] PortableCorpse: -k
[5:51:31] Sk82478: yep he is a lightning mouse
[5:52:10] Sk82478: I felt like a genius when I realized this the other day hahaha
[5:52:15] grimrevolution: There was a custom pikachu skin for kennen somewhere
[5:52:27] PortableCorpse: This pleases me
[5:52:35] grimrevolution: And an Ash skin for Twisted Fate
[5:52:38] Sk82478: nice
[5:52:46] Sk82478: yesssssssssssssssssss
[5:52:51] PortableCorpse: How bannable are those skins?
[5:53:01] grimrevolution: Discoheat made a video of them a while back
[5:53:08] grimrevolution: Not at all, they only show up on your screen
[5:53:14] Sk82478: i don't think they are. are thye?
[5:53:17] grimrevolution: Can't get banned for them
[5:53:17] PortableCorpse: Or do they live in a weird grey area
[5:53:22] Sk82478: yeah no one sees them but u
[5:53:29] arsel92: who win?

[5:54:02] dan_kweed: Jeep is the real winner
[5:54:14] PortableCorpse: i would drink it just based on the ad. I am easily swayed..
[5:54:37] dan_kweed: Dark Horse, the gatorade of China
[5:54:38] Shijiazhuang: CHINA HAIR WutFace
[5:54:41] haveyouseenmybearfaker: ad needed more shaq
[5:54:49] haveyouseenmybearfaker: every shaq ad is good
[5:54:53] dan_kweed: could probably get it on Amazon
[5:54:57] grimrevolution: ad needs more pen throwing
[5:54:59] Cripplespite: Team WE 2-0
[5:55:04] rofflepie: bring in world6.
[5:55:07] PortableCorpse: Damn it, dan
[5:55:12] EZ8_OCE: Just a case of mana potions from Amazon lol
[5:55:14] PortableCorpse: I guess I know what I'm looking at for the next few minutes
[5:55:25] grimrevolution: rip
[5:55:43] EZ8_OCE: If you find some and get them let us know what they're like lol
[5:56:11] dan_kweed: I mean, don't fo for the dragon ball z hair if you can't grow facial hair
[5:56:13] EZ8_OCE: I wonder if it's an energy drink like V or something

[5:56:49] michaelsund: BAN GALIO FFS
[5:57:00] Osteoid: CFL NotLikeThis
[5:57:11] EZ8_OCE: looool they didn't know about one of the biggest superbowl flops in recent history?
[5:57:18] world303: Stroking KappaPride
[5:57:30] haveyouseenmybearfaker: pls no
[5:57:32] rofflepie: WE prob wont pick kalista first pick
[5:57:47] Osteoid: WE VoHiYo
[5:57:48] dan_kweed: People always talk about how China and Japan have weird ads.... but America has Puppy-Monkey-Baby
[5:57:58] rofflepie: thresh here
[5:58:00] EZ8_OCE: ....wut?
[5:58:13] rofflepie: mystic doesnt like kalista
[5:58:17] michaelsund: Rakan first? LUL
[5:58:47] rofflepie: mystic will just go twitch again prob
[5:58:53] EZ8_OCE: lol I stopped playing Rakan after three or four games. I just feed i dont even know why
[5:59:39] 今朝厉害男王: Team WE PogChamp
[5:59:48] grimrevolution: He's a strange champ. I tend to like the tank supports more for sure
[6:00:17] michaelsund: Wtf Janna DansGame
[6:00:20] rofflepie: rakan is timing based, if u go in right time u can solo win a team fight, if u go in wrong time u die in 1 second
[6:00:22] world303: DansGame
[6:00:23] EZ8_OCE: @grimrevolution it's hard to nail down eh, like he's hard engage melee but not particularly tanky
[6:00:27] 尼奥: CrreamAwk
[6:00:52] EZ8_OCE: Janna my bae!!
[6:01:05] 今朝厉害男王: omg 7-1 4Head
[6:01:05] michaelsund: RuleFive
[6:02:00] PortableCorpse: Rakan is super fun in ARAM
[6:02:01] michaelsund: Picking Janna and banning Zac LUL
[6:02:29] EZ8_OCE: waste of a ban, just watched a game where she hard countered the shit out of him
[6:02:31] world303: LUL
[6:02:51] EZ8_OCE: Like oh you're jumpin in? NO
[6:03:00] haveyouseenmybearfaker: lck in picks and bans
[6:03:15] grimrevolution: @summonerez8 for sure. I feel like the best engages come out of using the ult and the entrance at the same time while most of them are distracted
[6:03:45] michaelsund: Who cares about the second best region Lck FailFish
[6:04:58] grimrevolution: I actually feel like Rakan does better without Xayah in most games
[6:05:10] EZ8_OCE: @grimrevolution Yeah, it's a hard balance, I think to really get good with him it would be a lot of practice, a lot of feed and a decent amunt of skill/timing
[6:05:12] rofflepie: but lms went to 5 games, lck only 4, are they really 2nd best hmm
[6:05:29] Nnitro5: lol
[6:05:42] rofflepie: as they would say in china, gamesmenship first, winning second, lck third
[6:05:46] Osteoid: LUL
[6:05:54] grimrevolution: lol
[6:05:57] Nnitro5: that girl bullying
[6:06:02] Nnitro5: xDDD
[6:06:17] grimrevolution: Frosk oh my god
[6:06:33] EZ8_OCE: He does seem to go really well with a Caitlin or a Kalista
[6:06:52] grimrevolution: I'd rather play with a Kalista tbh
[6:06:54] 今朝厉害男王: 国人吗
[6:06:55] ltfltf: Viewers LUL
[6:07:15] grimrevolution: Cait is okay, but I'd rather go Kalista or Tristana
[6:07:44] EZ8_OCE: Yeah, Fate's call giving you a bit of a fall back rather than just getting blown up if you botch the engage
[6:07:45] Sk82478: trist is off the chain RN in solo queue
[6:07:51] haveyouseenmybearfaker: or the best adc who is, of course, teemo
[6:08:08] LastOrder_lol: patch ?
[6:08:16] AndyChrist1: why is he called 957? WutFace
[6:08:38] rofflepie: its a hidden message
[6:08:44] rofflepie: look at 957 on ur numpad
[6:08:51] rofflepie: what letter does it spell
[6:08:52] AndyChrist1: like 9/11 D:
[6:08:56] Sk82478: cause hes just 1 more than 956
[6:09:29] michaelsund: Janna lane ResidentSleeper
[6:09:44] AndyChrist1: Lanna Jane ResidentSleeper
[6:09:49] Sk82478: IEG
[6:10:00] haveyouseenmybearfaker: Lois lane ResidentSleeper
[6:10:05] michaelsund: Classic e girl LUL
[6:10:22] AndyChrist1: Clark Kent ResidentSleeper
[6:10:51] grimrevolution: Teemo is the best everything @haveyouseenmybearfaker
[6:11:14] 布魯斯犬太: LUL
[6:11:16] grimrevolution: Tank? Best. Jungle? Best. Midlane? Best. Feeder? Best
[6:11:20] 尼奥: LUL
[6:11:21] haveyouseenmybearfaker: of course
[6:11:47] WhoKnowsUA: why janna not rushing sighstone lol, looks like low elo supports xD
[6:12:06] michaelsund: egirls rush ardent censer
[6:12:23] rofflepie: shit I am e girl support
[6:12:26] haveyouseenmybearfaker: never gonna give you up
[6:12:39] PortableCorpse: RIP me
[6:12:44] grimrevolution: never gonna let you down
[6:12:44] PortableCorpse: My google fu is failing me
[6:12:52] grimrevolution: did you find the drinks?
[6:13:04] WhoKnowsUA: ah i guess that type of Jannas who stay behind u and sometimes gives u E shield while u got hit by 2 enemy laners
[6:13:17] EZ8_OCE: as a support it tilts me so hard when I adc and my supp doesnt buy sightstone lol
[6:13:19] PortableCorpse: I know the drink name now, but haven't been able to find any where to buy them
[6:13:20] c_ide: didnt janna have a health crystal
[6:13:32] michaelsund: Yes the alt tab Janna
[6:13:34] rofflepie: better than those janna trying to insec with flash ult every 5 mins for no reason
[6:14:07] haveyouseenmybearfaker: what's the drink name?
[6:14:10] grimrevolution: they want those youtube plays
[6:14:10] michaelsund: LUL
[6:14:20] PortableCorpse: 战马 is the name
[6:14:23] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 not only that but she's so squshy without sightstone and she died already
[6:14:27] PortableCorpse: it means War Horse apparently
[6:14:30] rofflepie: i rather play with a janna that stands back to shield and q when getting engaged than janna trying to "make plays" all the time and tornado in lane for no reason
[6:14:32] michaelsund: I actually saw a Janna montage
[6:15:08] grimrevolution: what was that like
[6:15:13] EZ8_OCE: @Regrup very true, makes you that much more durable. Like I understand the shield buff surely second item
[6:15:53] michaelsund: Insane tornados DBstyle
[6:16:07] haveyouseenmybearfaker: basically sharknado
[6:16:13] grimrevolution: sounds like a breeze
[6:17:05] PortableCorpse: Help meeee
[6:17:14] PortableCorpse: I'm tiltinggg
[6:17:19] WhoKnowsUA: Janna Sona Soraka is overused by egirls it's not like this supports are bad or low skill capped u can actually make good plays and u will always can see is that a good support near u or bad especially if u main adc. This is actually so enjoyable to deny some jungler's jump with your Q as Janna
[6:18:49] world303: NotLikeThis
[6:19:06] WhoKnowsUA: literally soloq low elo Janna
[6:19:20] one_more_plz: 15 min no sightstone FailFish
[6:19:22] WhoKnowsUA: with that rush
[6:19:29] grimrevolution: This is painful
[6:19:33] EZ8_OCE: Honestly I like Janna as a support, so much disengage potential and if you know what you're doing with her she's pretty high up the tier list
[6:19:41] EZ8_OCE: But she does need that SS
[6:20:00] AndyChrist1: Report support no ards BabyRage
[6:20:08] EZ8_OCE: Like sightstone upgraded coin THEN censer or redemp
[6:20:08] AndyChrist1: wards*
[6:20:17] grimrevolution: No control wards either
[6:20:43] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 she rely so much on her adc to be atleast decent so it can backfire u when u have a monkey. I like to play janna lulu while autofilled but it tilts me so hard when i have ape adc, i can't fucking save him when he goes 1 v 5 or get caught or something like that
[6:20:50] trisssmerigold: frosk at it again, these are pro challenger players, with coach analyzing the game 24/7, its a team decision, analyze why they did it rather than make fun of them like you know better
[6:21:10] trisssmerigold: this is why frosk is so garbage tier analyst caster
[6:21:27] trisssmerigold: you think a pro support player doesnt know the importance of sight stone??
[6:21:48] PortableCorpse: 🤔
[6:21:56] rofflepie: it basiclly makes 1 item trist into 2 item trist, bypassing the weak early hamr
[6:21:58] WhoKnowsUA: he can be tilted and make wrong decisions or u think just bcs he';s pro he can't make mistakes?
[6:22:02] rofflepie: game
[6:22:11] trisssmerigold: they made their decision to make a choice, and the result ahvent even shown yet
[6:22:27] EZ8_OCE: @Regrup Yeah I've definitely been there. I try to only use her in solo queue if I'm duo with an adc I trust. Just part of being a suppport, so often if adc is a moron you get hung out to dry and also cop the blame
[6:22:27] world303: gachiGASM
[6:22:29] one_more_plz: at least the janna isnt building ap Kappa
[6:22:40] trisssmerigold: its already annoying and frustrating to listen to this even after this strat fails, now its even before whether this choice proved to be good or bad
[6:22:55] rodricide: No bueno LUL
[6:23:04] 川のカリス: 957 FailFish
[6:23:05] trisssmerigold: and frosk is already making fun at them like at some bronze players that doesnt know the importances of wards
[6:23:21] Fr3nd0: Jebaited twitch chat having a conversation Jebaited
[6:23:30] WhoKnowsUA: actually WE didn't realized Janna have no vision, usually in soloq games it can fuck up botlane without wards really hard to be camped/gangbanged
[6:23:36] Nnitro5: stop saying stupid things , they are pros yhat play this game 24/7 with a coach and they know how to play why do u thi kthey are playing there and u r not? maybe because they know what they are doing? ffs stop saying stupid things
[6:23:43] PortableCorpse: So any way, if I can find that drink somewhere, I'll order it and give it a try
[6:23:50] WhoKnowsUA: actually WE probably didn't realized Janna have no vision, usually in soloq games it can fuck up botlane without wards really hard to be camped
[6:24:11] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse if you do we need the review
[6:24:18] trisssmerigold: yeah you know waht? a pro player knows the importance of SIghtstone, and they CHOSE to rush another item, its not liek they suddenly forget theres wars to buy
[6:24:22] rofflepie: actually WE probably didn't realized Janna have no vision, usually in soloq games it can fuck up botlane without wards really hard to be camped
[6:24:31] trisssmerigold: so for exactly what is Frosk making fun of them??
[6:24:52] trisssmerigold: other than being annoying and proving why she's a garbage tier color caster?
[6:25:07] Nnitro5: i would love to see u guys playing there lol would be so fun
[6:25:21] trisssmerigold: its not even after this choice turned out to be a failure
[6:25:33] daddymoch: @trisssmerigold preach it my man
[6:25:35] EZ8_OCE: I would be 0/10 by now in this elo haha in all honesty
[6:25:39] trisssmerigold: analyze why they made this choice, what their strategyu is, isnt it what youre supposed to do???
[6:27:14] WhoKnowsUA: @Nnitro5 yes they are pros, but coach can't talk to them ingame, plus they do not suddenly discuss their items choices. 1 player can make sudden mistake or misjudge situation. It's not like they talk to each other every 3 minutes while at base "what should i buy" lol
[6:27:17] world303: Exposed Kappa
[6:27:25] grimrevolution: I liked it better when we were talking about shitty team comps lol
[6:27:32] trisssmerigold: @daddymoch im just pointing it out , as there are just so many times like these I normally wouldnt even bother
[6:27:37] EZ8_OCE: the Tristana is 1/0, censer hard buffs healing and shields. I'd say it was about Tristana surviving laning phase against hard engage and CC. It worked. Tristana has a built in escape with her W anyway so I guess last minute gank escapes are possible with her
[6:27:40] PortableCorpse: I tried a full support team once
[6:27:50] trisssmerigold: @daddymoch but the other day pulse or some other mod
[6:27:51] PortableCorpse: that was a fun game
[6:28:21] rofflepie: the idea is that ardent censor helps trist bypass weak early game, and their goal is to stay in lane push towers so u dont roam in the jungle a lot to deep ward, whether thats right or wrong is debatable
[6:28:22] 尼奥: PogChamp
[6:28:33] world303: pop him cmonBruh
[6:29:22] PortableCorpse: It's happening my boys
[6:29:27] PortableCorpse: My prediction dreams are alive
[6:29:30] one_more_plz: fight in jungle against syndra FailFish
[6:29:42] EZ8_OCE: she would have had yellow trinket too, thats pretty much enough between Janna and Trist to keep river bush warded
[6:29:55] michaelsund: Go to game 3 this is over ResidentSleeper
[6:29:58] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 look how WE didn't really cared that janna have no vision, probably didn't saw or ignored that fact, it could backfire their bot if WE actually decided to camp them or focus bot hard as 5 ppl.
[6:30:38] rofflepie: having reksai does help, even if there is no ward, gragas cant go in tri bush to camp for no reason cause he doesnt know if reksai knows he s there or not
[6:30:39] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 it's enough in early but u gave up vision control around bot, u have no red trinket and u can't ward drake or ward deep in the jungle etc
[6:30:43] rofflepie: its a mind game
[6:31:56] grimrevolution: This place turned into classic twitch chat and I'm OUTTA here lol
[6:32:06] WhoKnowsUA: well actually ardent rush looked like cheesy stuff and it's worked so they bypassed their weaknesses when having no vision control. It worked in this game but can backfire in others
[6:32:06] michaelsund: NotLikeThis
[6:32:08] PortableCorpse: No, grim.
[6:32:10] EZ8_OCE: @Regrup True, it was a gamble for OMG but it's worked out for them. They do lose vision control but I guess that also depends on Rek Sai keeping track of Gragas and using her trackers knife well
[6:32:14] PortableCorpse: Don't leave me. :(
[6:32:24] rebeccamo: is this really 1080p ResidentSleeper
[6:32:38] rofflepie: classic twitch chat would be vaultboy boys all around and luling at dragon steal instead of discussing item builds
[6:33:07] PortableCorpse: lol?
[6:33:20] EZ8_OCE: I've never seen such intelligent conversation and actual discussion in twitch chat before haha
[6:33:21] 尼奥: again EleGiggle
[6:33:28] michaelsund: Lost a 4v3 LUL
[6:33:43] EZ8_OCE: Elder Dragon team WE is back maybe
[6:33:47] PortableCorpse: I think that yeah, they didn't get punished this time for it, but I don't know if I necessarily agree with the decision.
[6:33:50] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie bcs u can't really discuss in a fast moving chat with 50k + viewers, this chat looks like some random streamer where chatters just arguing or talk with each other xD
[6:34:11] one_more_plz: fighting in the same place NotLikeThis
[6:34:48] rofflepie: which is fine, lpl chat brings up a random topic then talks about it for a while, then new topic appears
[6:34:58] EZ8_OCE: It's not the build path I would take myself but he I'm not being paid to play
[6:35:08] rofflepie: like how we had gundam talk an hour ago and emulator game talk 30mins ago
[6:35:16] PortableCorpse: yeah, roffle
[6:35:28] rofflepie: yesterday people argued about cait for an hour
[6:35:29] PortableCorpse: LPL chat has been super chill and I've enjoyed it
[6:35:49] roll1ng1: na wall
[6:35:50] michaelsund: We talked about how Disney sucks Kappa
[6:36:05] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie that's bcs of low viewer numbers, in the past when LPL en stream was hyped it was just impossible with 50k+ viewers
[6:36:29] EZ8_OCE: It's actually a good chat in LPL but I guess if you look at viewers there 1300 here, there's 14000 in the LCK chat. We wouldn't be able to do this over there
[6:36:29] PortableCorpse: I miss runaan's cait. :(
[6:36:56] rofflepie: i understand that, i dont even talk in NALCS chat besides the random VaultBoy me carry VaultBoy here and there
[6:37:13] michaelsund: Slmz FailFish
[6:37:40] WhoKnowsUA: need Draven/Cait picks to make those Tristana pickers suffer alot xD
[6:37:51] PortableCorpse: Draven Pogchamp
[6:38:20] michaelsund: Need Sivir comps
[6:38:27] EZ8_OCE: Holy crap, Draven in low elo solo Q. Gets two items and wins games. Ridiculous
[6:38:27] PortableCorpse: I can't type this morning
[6:38:40] Anarcyst: JIekou lol
[6:38:43] PortableCorpse: That or he feeds his face off, ez8
[6:38:48] Osteoid: Condi PogChamp
[6:38:50] goblinguy01: Pulse is TehePelo
[6:38:55] EZ8_OCE: haha true
[6:39:06] rofflepie: condi son of baron, lord of dragon, destroyer or nexus
[6:39:24] EZ8_OCE: I've been ruined by Draven a couple times lately.
[6:39:28] goblinguy01: Omg please
[6:39:35] PortableCorpse: Legit played against a Draven who gave up two kills in bot lane and then proceeded to run it down mid and talk shit on us for killing him.
[6:39:37] goblinguy01: OMG*
[6:39:46] michaelsund: Omg frontline inting NotLikeThis
[6:39:59] rofflepie: man i wish vincent would go pro
[6:40:00] PortableCorpse: Like, you're punishing your team for you being bad????
[6:40:01] world303: LUL
[6:40:03] trisssmerigold: what does she mean dont need to be there, they were there contesting the dragon
[6:40:06] rofflepie: his draven is prob best in the world
[6:40:20] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 he can do that aswell in any elo, his snowball is impossible to stop, money out of nowhere, 6 items draven at 25 min vs 2-2.5
[6:40:20] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse sounds like either Tyler1 or one of the monkey asf ADCs that are out there
[6:40:40] PortableCorpse: He wished he was Tyler1
[6:40:50] goblinguy01: I'm glad we can see an aggressive style for world Elite. I got use to S2 WeiXiao team composition
[6:41:24] WhoKnowsUA: Simple tactics against draven to play passively and wait of ganks, and do not engage risky fights
[6:41:52] EZ8_OCE: Tyler may be a headcase but he is a good draven haha. Sounds like all that guy had was a bad attitude
[6:41:52] PortableCorpse: Alternatively, wait for Draven to try and solo dive you and then cc him
[6:42:02] goblinguy01: ^^ Snake Krystal Draven was Kreygasm
[6:42:11] michaelsund: Pstar zilean best Draven Kappa
[6:42:17] Nnitro5: braum really usefull against draven
[6:42:23] 布魯斯犬太: AFK J4 REPORT
[6:42:24] rofflepie: watch how vincent plays draven, he chucks his enemy to 1/3 before jungle even finish his first 3 camps, and even if jungle comes he just kill them 2 v 3
[6:42:46] WhoKnowsUA: Draven have really huge weaknesses when he's not fed, he's no escape ADC with low range and need to catch Axes, so around midgame it can be easy to catch him or burst down fast
[6:42:51] nutmilk___: AFK WutFace
[6:42:56] 布魯斯犬太: REPORT J4 AFK
[6:42:58] one_more_plz: afk j4 LUL
[6:43:11] PortableCorpse: I just don't enjoy playing Draven at all
[6:43:36] EZ8_OCE: Yeah if you can put a hard CC on him he's over just like if you can stop a Kat from moving for even a couple of seconds
[6:43:42] world303: LUL
[6:44:05] PortableCorpse: Kat's trying to jump in and ult your team when you're nami is adorable
[6:44:15] goblinguy01: You know, 10 bans. Just ban it
[6:44:22] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie it's also depends on supports/enemy adc u it's hard to chunk something like zyra cait, u will lose half HP before u even run towards them. It's also tilts me so hard when i pick draven and my support picks passive supp like Soraka Janna and then staying behind me
[6:44:55] Anarcyst: Ben played that well
[6:44:59] EZ8_OCE: Today I was running a Malphite jg. Their Kat was pretty fed so my ult was reserved fro when she tried to come in. We won every team fight
[6:45:00] goblinguy01: If not build a Deathball LPL team Comp like Reksai, Shen/J4, APC, Lucian/Braum
[6:45:08] WhoKnowsUA: Plus his Axes really show's where he wants to move so u can go there or put traps or anything there
[6:45:16] rofflepie: of course, but thats how to play draven though, u trade aggresively and trade kills when needed, sometimes u lose caue of that, but its not like normal adc where the goal is to trade farm and scale
[6:45:18] TheFurioso: syndra balanced
[6:45:21] world303: Janna BrokeBack
[6:45:22] michaelsund: Smlz played these fights so bad

[6:46:02] goblinguy01: You had the easy kills mate
[6:46:07] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie he actually have god midgame/decent late but it's really hard to keep Axes up in a huge 5 v 5
[6:46:30] 布魯斯犬太: SMLZ SO BA FailFish
[6:46:34] michaelsund: Smlz went Hurricane instead of pd Big XD
[6:46:38] Anarcyst: watch ben
[6:46:41] PortableCorpse: He was just a Janna ult away from killing everybody
[6:46:44] WhoKnowsUA: @rofflepie so even when he's now snowballed it's not the end of the game u still can win etc with right conditions
[6:46:49] KappaFrankerZXD: smlz on a late game hypercarry WutFace
[6:46:50] goblinguy01: OMG just threw that fight imo
[6:47:07] goblinguy01: Ben and Condi saved the game for world elite
[6:47:09] nerobotas: syndra mechanics

[6:48:01] Munchinsteaks: tahm kench
[6:48:11] one_more_plz: if that crit killed gragas tristana would have clean up the fight
[6:48:13] trisssmerigold: wat??? are these casters freaking blind?? 2 was alaready on trist, janna ult actually blew them a bit
[6:48:18] rofflepie: imagine chen from dota in league
[6:48:25] rofflepie: the amount of trolling in solo q
[6:48:39] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 malphite jungle can't really work higher than low plat bcs he have no presence in game before 6. Plus smart kat should go to ult only after enemies use their Hard CC to interrupt her ult. I just assume u your team was way ahead and your ult wasn't needed for engages to win fights
[6:48:50] KappaFrankerZXD: mystic needs to not suicide
[6:49:01] michaelsund: I dont understand how Omg botlane isnt able to 2v8
[6:49:10] Anarcyst: janna ult was prior to the fight
[6:49:12] DterrorA: SKT 957 PogChamp
[6:49:13] michaelsund: It should be easy
[6:49:28] nerobotas: nice elder drake lul
[6:49:45] EZ8_OCE: @Regrup yeah this is low elo norms. Nah we were actually losing but we had other CC and I would often just jump on her once she got in range
[6:50:05] nerobotas: because chinese people are watching on panda tv
[6:50:12] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 bcs u can't really reserve your ult as malphite no matter where u play him jungle or top, ulting in 1 person isn't really good for fight except that she's the only one fed
[6:50:25] trisssmerigold: becasue these casters are cancerous to listen to
[6:50:30] nerobotas: gg
[6:50:34] Anarcyst: gg
[6:50:37] PortableCorpse: oh
[6:50:41] PortableCorpse: RIP
[6:50:41] 布魯斯犬太: ggg
[6:50:42] michaelsund: NotLikeThis

[6:51:08] foo730: wtf
[6:51:08] one_more_plz: penta PogChamp
[6:51:17] EZ8_OCE: @Regrup yeah that was basically our problem she was the only fed one, she was getting pentas and quadras lol once we took her out the resot of their team fell apart
[6:51:18] krazychicken55: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ugh 40min game
[6:51:19] 尼奥: YouDontSay
[6:51:19] rofflepie: "close:
[6:51:24] BeAr71169: mystic Kreygasm
[6:51:24] michaelsund: SMLZ TRASH
[6:51:25] Stuntern: Penta mystic
[6:52:00] rofflepie: so I called it, WE 2-0
[6:52:16] PortableCorpse: It was so close to being that 2-1. T_T
[6:52:25] Jonny116: L@
[6:52:40] EZ8_OCE: @PortableCorpse guess who called the 2-0
[6:52:41] michaelsund: NA has 1 import slot empty? LUL
[6:52:49] MisakiKureha: OMG TearGlove TearGlove PunOko PunOko TearGlove PunOko CrreamAwk
[6:53:02] one_more_plz: OMG first place group B BrokeBack
[6:53:13] PortableCorpse: good game though
[6:53:20] EZ8_OCE: definitely was
[6:53:26] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 which is my point xD hard to keep such massive ult like from malph for just one person while u can actualyl combo wombo enemy team. If im not adcing or face kata as my laner i try to reserve my interrupting CC for her (Diana E, Kassa Q for example) which is much easier than malph ult with such huge CD
[6:54:12] WhoKnowsUA: @summonerez8 or if i'm autofilled supp i just take Alistar and save my combo for Kata
[6:54:45] EZ8_OCE: This has been fun. I'm sure I'll run into you lot in twitch chat again. Time to go play myself :D at like 12:30 in the morning. Woo OCE
[6:54:53] krazychicken55: blitz can hard counter kata also
[6:54:56] PortableCorpse: Later, ez8!
[6:55:00] goblinguy01: World Elite is going to look so good in Worlds
[6:55:03] PortableCorpse: I friended you for maximum Gundam love
[6:55:06] krazychicken55: too much cc can make kat useless
[6:55:12] goblinguy01: They can beat most teams in the world :P
[6:55:37] goblinguy01: Let's hope they aren't in a group with SKT/KT. Save that for Quarters
[6:55:41] Cripplespite: who won?
[6:55:50] 厉害大王: WE
[6:55:53] goblinguy01: Good LCK Casters are from LPL
[6:55:59] goblinguy01: Atlus and Papa
[6:56:01] TokyoQuaSar: He looks like a cockatoo
[6:56:16] Nnitro5: xD
[6:56:19] goblinguy01: Atlus is KappaPride
[6:56:35] rofflepie: condi is the new -_- now ryu is gone for a while
[6:56:39] goblinguy01: I mean Papa, PastryTime and Atlus come in here still
[6:56:41] PortableCorpse: rayPride
[6:56:46] WhoKnowsUA: @Krazychicken55 depends on elo but it's not like new Kata rely on her ult that much like before rework. Plus smart players always try to find windows
[6:56:50] TRBLS: Kappa
[6:57:09] goblinguy01: It's good seeing OG LPL casters
[6:57:25] goblinguy01: Uzi is the best known Chinese player
[6:57:53] rofflepie: Uzi has teammate - 10% status debuff
[6:57:57] goblinguy01: Besides WeiXiao, PDD, Clearlove? Who is more famous then Uzi
[6:58:06] RustyTheCaster: more famous sure, but not best
[6:58:12] WhoKnowsUA: @Krazychicken55 in low elo players tend to just spam CC abilities just to simply engage backline without reserving/ignoring huge thread like Kata
[6:58:24] goblinguy01: NaMei Kreygasm
[6:58:26] AndyChrist1: how is the other guy called ? besides pulse and frost ? (sorry im new here )
[6:58:36] rofflepie: xiaohu and mlxg plays worse when uzi is back, if RNG plays the same way they do when y4 is playing, but with uzi, they would be best team in the lpl
[6:58:38] mujarshad: Raz
[6:58:39] world303: Pulse hair looks like he got electrocuted Kappa
[6:59:01] hozzayy: @AndyChrist1 ANELE
[6:59:02] WhoKnowsUA: maybe he was xD
[6:59:06] goblinguy01: Uzi isn't the issue on RNG
[6:59:20] goblinguy01: Same for OMG. too many personalities
[6:59:39] AndyChrist1: racists jokes aren't funny anymore FailFish
[6:59:56] goblinguy01: I love Uzi, but Frosk makes a point
[7:00:02] readyfordeparture: why noone watch chinese??
[7:00:05] hozzayy: get laid
[7:00:32] PrawnProwler: Uzi's definitely a big resource hog but I feel the team's choose to play around him rather than he makes them do it
[7:00:36] mujarshad: LOOOOOOl
[7:00:39] goblinguy01: NaMei was the best adc in S4 in the world until Imp took the title
[7:00:55] goblinguy01: Uzi only beat EDG in Worlds in Quarters
[7:00:56] rofflepie: uzi should wear a y4 mask and miss a few cs in lane, xiaohu and mlxg would play better, and when team fight starts, uzi takes off the face mask and carries
[7:01:24] goblinguy01: Too many good teams in China, sucks they only get 3 slots
[7:02:16] WhoKnowsUA: @goblibguy01 CN teams was overrated 2 seasons in a row, what good teams u are talking about
[7:02:56] rofflepie: lpl is a very deep league right now
[7:02:57] goblinguy01: @regrup Domestic mate. There are 5 good teams and the rest of the teams are competing
[7:03:20] goblinguy01: @regrup I can say the same about Na and Eu. Top 4 worlds eh?
[7:03:25] rofflepie: 10th place lpl would beat #3 NA team right now
[7:03:29] KappaFrankerZXD: pulse enjoys the sneaky rebuttal at the end of the stream ;)
[7:03:34] goblinguy01: You don't see me insulting Na and Eu
[7:03:56] goblinguy01: TL couldn't beat VG
[7:04:04] WhoKnowsUA: @goblibguy01 idk after underperforming that hard they shouldn't have 3 slots TBH, for me personally LMS teams is stronger RN, i would give that slot to them
[7:04:04] prigovor_: @goblibguy01 what did she say about Uzi?
[7:04:09] goblinguy01: I bet VG could beat half of Na
[7:04:19] razlol: cya guys!
[7:04:32] razlol: hope you guys enjoyed the show
[7:04:43] FlookiDAYI: hi
[7:04:46] goblinguy01: @prigovor Uzi fails to perform domestically, but he known as a great player internationally
[7:04:46] PortableCorpse: rayGuys
[7:04:53] PortableCorpse: Good show, catch you later doods
[7:04:57] FlookiDAYI: TwitchLit
[7:04:58] goblinguy01: Later :D
[7:05:33] goblinguy01: @regrup So NA should get 2 slots as well. Using your logic, Korea should get more slots?
[7:05:48] AndyChrist1: RITO EleGiggle
[7:05:49] goblinguy01: Can't talk about China being bad at worlds without looking at Na.
[7:06:48] goblinguy01: They need a system to add/remove slots for worlds if they create a metric
