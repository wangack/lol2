[1:09:00] rofflepie: teams need to just ban kass from fenfen, he is literally a one trick kass
[1:09:37] 布魯斯犬太: @rofflepie yeah , i agree
[1:13:55] grimrevolution: if edg wins though people still won't ban the kass
[1:14:11] Griech: Today is my birthday!

[1:17:13] ffujitive: haHAA
[1:17:14] 甜野的小迷妹: Everyone is
[1:17:20] rofflepie: like i get why edg doesnt ban it, they want him to take it and punish the weak early game with rotations and cait siege, but fenfen's delta between kass and his next best champ is like challenger to plat
[1:18:26] 布魯斯犬太: WOW 1719
[1:18:38] myheartdied: Cait dmg
[1:18:43] ffujitive: Caitlyn balanced delete this camp
[1:19:09] 甜野的小迷妹: They probably want to try and beat them even when fenfen has his best champ. It's game 1 anyway
[1:19:25] grayofblood: OPL > LPL
[1:19:38] grayofblood: 346 EleGiggle
[1:19:44] grimrevolution: @rofflepie yeah, i haven't watched enough of his games/paid close enough attention to actually form that much of an opinion about his other champs

[1:20:51] dapanzhu: @myhestia Better region than korea, According to the last tournament
[1:21:07] myheartdied: Yep they should ban kass lol

[1:30:44] Fr3nd0: wait apparently i missed an epic throw SaltyFrosk
[1:31:05] rofflepie: edg is just too cocky, they dont think kass is good so they dont care

[2:08:42] goblinguy01: Has EDG fixed their issues since S4? You can't replacement talent to fix their late game issues. I think S4 EDG has much less issues than S5/S6.

[2:21:45] goblinguy01: You know what to expect from WE, but they are best team in LpL
[2:22:17] rofflepie: dont agree with that at all, maybe cause I read more chinese league than frosk, but no one in china (the pros not the fans) think EDG is good roster wise
[2:22:22] goblinguy01: "See hero, Kill hero" - Alex Ich S2 Worlds
[2:22:24] rofflepie: edg acutally wins with good macro and team play
[2:22:34] harrisonju: why did EDG do so bad today? Didn't get to see all the games
[2:22:44] rofflepie: the talent is not that high
[2:22:49] grimrevolution: Disrespectful drafts
[2:23:22] rofflepie: WE has better talent in 4 of the 5 roles atm
[2:23:29] harrisonju: do you thinkteams that are faavored just refuse to ban someone out of pride?
[2:23:31] goblinguy01: WE don't tilt as easily and they have Condi. Clearlove tilts and EDG tilts entirely
[2:23:35] SSG_Crown: MingLee
[2:23:36] Optyfenx: bench uzi already FailFish
[2:23:54] goblinguy01: Even with Deft and Pawn on their team, Clearlove was the shotcaller
[2:23:55] harrisonju: i bet it happens more often than not and ends up biting them in the ass
[2:24:19] michaelsund: MingLee
[2:24:55] harrisonju: KT probably has the most holes for a "top" tiered team
[2:24:56] goblinguy01: What song is this mods?
[2:25:30] cantspeel: Ready-For-Love
[2:25:45] WhoKnowsUA: @goblibguy01 it was whole M5/Gambit style not only Alexich, they all had agressive playstyle except Genja
[2:25:45] harrisonju: btw does anyone know why Uzi was sick or just not playing until recently? Only started following LPL around last week
[2:25:46] goblinguy01: I will look it up. Thanks buddy
[2:25:55] cantspeel: thats the best i got its a broadcast song
[2:25:58] rofflepie: its ok KT will beat Afreeca, KT has 3 lpl and 2 lck, afreeca has 2 lpl and 3 lck, and since lpl > lck, KT > afreeca /r/theydidthemath
[2:26:46] rofflepie: r u not allowed to just cast the chinese stream sound for inbetween the games
[2:26:52] rofflepie: the prize draw seems interesting
[2:27:13] goblinguy01: @regrup I mean LpL moved away from that See Hero, Kill Hero style.
[2:27:24] Pfefferfuchs: why does she carry around a car?
[2:27:35] Optyfenx: agressive genja was the best genja
[2:27:43] Fr3nd0: is this a prank or did sng just 2-0 edg
[2:27:49] michaelsund: Genja WutFace
[2:27:52] Pfefferfuchs: car gone
[2:28:09] goblinguy01: The teams at worlds, IG and World Elite were not See Hero, Kill hero. It was different unlike M5
[2:28:21] cantspeel: pentakill PulseChamp
[2:28:22] goblinguy01: Giving away Rumble to PDD was pretty much GG
[2:28:50] rofflepie: was rumble a thing season 2, i thought it came out season 3
[2:28:51] PulseIRL: PulseChamp PulseChamp PulseChamp PulseChamp PulseChamp
[2:29:00] Fr3nd0: cn golddigger PogChamp
[2:29:07] pilgrimage01: omg girl oh no not them

[2:29:15] pilgrimage01: im burning
[2:29:17] Optyfenx: ye you should watch season 2 games from wickd on rumble
[2:29:24] Optyfenx: only thing he did was push and die by the jungler LUL
[2:29:31] besimtibuk69: beautiful
[2:29:35] rofflepie: i watched the whole worlds season 2 i dont remember rumble
[2:29:35] michaelsund: Wickd LUL
[2:29:43] Fr3nd0: that skirt tho Kreygasm
[2:29:52] harrisonju: wow wick "can only play 3 champs" ed
[2:29:56] goblinguy01: I rewatched IEM Singapore. IG vs CJ Frost. IG got Rumble, and PDD 1v2 Helios and Shy
[2:30:03] WhoKnowsUA: LPL Viewership PogChamp
[2:30:05] michaelsund: *can only play Irelia
[2:30:18] harrisonju: picks riven into singed
[2:30:26] goblinguy01: PDD almost won a 1v2 without flash xD
[2:30:27] Rudiko: \m/
[2:30:28] roychas: Hello everyone
[2:30:41] roychas: Is there any girls
[2:30:51] roychas: StoneLightning
[2:30:51] michaelsund: BCWarrior
[2:30:55] Fr3nd0: just war horse move on
[2:31:04] roychas: GingerPower
[2:31:22] roychas: Uzi
[2:31:26] Rudiko: edg lost?
[2:31:28] Fr3nd0: faker is live PogChamp retirement set in
[2:31:36] Rudiko: SaltyFrosk
[2:31:45] roychas: Skt..
[2:32:06] roychas: Skt will be champion
[2:32:13] harrisonju: Faker owns buildings lol
[2:32:20] harrisonju: he can just retire now and not worry about money
[2:32:43] harrisonju: BR team vs TSM world finals this year since SKT is gone
[2:33:21] roychas: We
[2:33:22] grimrevolution: Uzi and Frosk with matching glasses
[2:33:42] harrisonju: where is mlxg
[2:33:45] michaelsund: Mlxg LUL
[2:34:28] roychas: How do u think about ljl
[2:34:55] Fr3nd0: he ate to much spicy hot pot Kappa
[2:35:01] AlisonWunderland: uzi is back PogChamp
[2:35:03] rofflepie: 991 dps wtf
[2:35:27] michaelsund: Rookie is always the best Kappa
[2:36:05] kawaiiguy666: he makes an equalizer without playing rumble
[2:37:12] PortableCorpse: hey all
[2:37:20] grimrevolution: hey
[2:38:07] PortableCorpse: How's it going, grim?
[2:38:20] grimrevolution: Not bad, you?
[2:38:27] PortableCorpse: I'm good
[2:38:35] 水枪呆毛: Wtf this jger name IMsucks
[2:38:55] rofflepie: uzi twtich incoming
[2:39:16] PortableCorpse: 🤔
[2:39:23] PortableCorpse: I wouldn't even be mad
[2:40:01] RustyTheCaster: nah Uzi is better suited to trist here
[2:40:19] rofflepie: he will take twitch 100% if it is not banned here
[2:42:01] Optyfenx: uzi vayne PogChamp
[2:42:27] RustyTheCaster: god I hope not
[2:42:32] 日歌: = =
[2:42:34] RustyTheCaster: @rofflepie ;)
[2:42:46] rofflepie: not liking that at all
[2:43:02] RustyTheCaster: why?
[2:43:12] RustyTheCaster: if you prefer twitch you should be happier he is trist
[2:43:47] im_moyo: rusty tell him to play vayne next game pls
[2:43:55] im_moyo: <3
[2:44:00] rofflepie: galio comps are much better with twitch and kog than trist, his twitch is also better than his trist, not that he is bad on trist (3 shot bjerg at worlds)
[2:44:13] PortableCorpse: Can we get a thornmail Ashe please?
[2:44:14] RustyTheCaster: I don't understand why twitch and kog are strictly better with a galio comp though
[2:44:20] RustyTheCaster: they're all hyper carries that scale
[2:44:42] Shark_Carry: wtf lol
[2:44:43] 今朝厉害男王: RNGay PogChamp
[2:44:44] thedankbong: rngay?
[2:44:53] 今朝厉害男王: WTF
[2:45:01] thedankbong: GAY LUL
[2:45:10] Shark_Carry: tried the G A Y i guess
[2:45:11] 甜野的小迷妹: It's a nickname Chinese fans give them
[2:45:19] rofflepie: twitch does a lot more damag ein the type of fight galio sets up, its like a huge cluster in the middle instead of proper front to back
[2:45:21] 甜野的小迷妹: cuz xiaohu is...... pretty gay Keepo
[2:45:41] PortableCorpse: aren't we all pretty gay?
[2:45:54] 甜野的小迷妹: Also Oh My Gay is up there as well
[2:45:57] rofflepie: if this was vasilli, then I agree with trist 100% over twitch
[2:45:58] grimrevolution: Pretty gay? Honey I am 100% gay
[2:46:16] PortableCorpse: i'm at least 70% gay
[2:46:17] 甜野的小迷妹: SeemsGood
[2:46:19] RustyTheCaster: ok that doesn't make sense dude
[2:46:27] RustyTheCaster: you can say that trist is worse than twitch but if someone else plays it it's okm
[2:46:48] rofflepie: cause uzi is better at twtich than trist, and vasilli is the other way around
[2:46:49] harrisonju: wow blue side but no super leash
[2:46:57] PortableCorpse: AT least it isn't PugMaw.
[2:46:59] RustyTheCaster: that's so vastly different to your first point
[2:47:07] RustyTheCaster: and you know what that's fine but don't muddle em!
[2:48:06] CDMLoL: I just got here and don't exactly watch LPL but pree sure Trist is a better pick period
[2:48:22] RustyTheCaster: :)
[2:48:32] Osteoid: Uzi back PogChamp
[2:48:33] grimrevolution: Trist is good. I like the trist
[2:48:42] AlisonWunderland: @RUSTYTheCASTER KonCha KonCha
[2:48:46] grimrevolution: She actually has an okay early game compared to other scalers
[2:48:51] PortableCorpse: Don't you mean Delta Fox? :^)
[2:49:03] rofflepie: all of WE's galio comps, kog first choice, twitch 2nd choice, pretty sure they are way familiar with this particular comp than any other lpl team atm
[2:49:07] harrisonju: pros have talked about how trist is like borderline okay pick, you don't like her but you have to when cait/kalista are banned and you want that long range aa adc
[2:49:22] michaelsund: Talking about NA teams in the best region chat should be bannable
[2:49:31] RustyTheCaster: hi @AlisonWunderland
[2:49:54] grimrevolution: Looper used to be on RNG tho
[2:50:09] PortableCorpse: Rusty, how you feeling dude?
[2:50:22] harrisonju: idk how delta fox is an upgrade
[2:50:58] grimrevolution: But where's the Alpha Fox
[2:51:04] grimrevolution: Or the Bravo Fox
[2:51:17] RustyTheCaster: I'm alright @PortableCorpse, mostly just throat pains
[2:51:21] RustyTheCaster: thanks for asking!
[2:51:30] PortableCorpse: Get better soon!
[2:51:42] harrisonju: I want Sigma Fox
[2:51:49] PortableCorpse: Or continue being our dancing analysis monkey
[2:51:53] RustyTheCaster: haha
[2:51:59] rofflepie: echo fox might get relegated before franchising comes in
[2:52:03] RustyTheCaster: I'm overthinking twitch chat, haven't had a chance to explode on broadcast
[2:52:12] CDMLoL: that throat is the money maker look after it <3
[2:52:14] grimrevolution: I'm partial to Foxtrot fox specifically
[2:52:36] harrisonju: i want CLG EU back
[2:52:45] PortableCorpse: Foxtrot Fox also does the foxtrot every time they win, right?
[2:52:56] grimrevolution: For sure
[2:53:02] grimrevolution: They also play only Band comps
[2:53:20] harrisonju: damn the reksai looks like he's doing w/e the fuck he wants and getting away with it
[2:53:28] PandanPaisen: @RUSTYTheCASTER what do you think the safest blind pick supp is in your opinion?
[2:53:51] RustyTheCaster: Safest blind pick sup? Braum probably
[2:53:55] harrisonju: once an LPL team wins worlds, they'll care, but until then....
[2:54:02] grimrevolution: I'm a westerner and I think the LPL is far more entertaining than NA and EU
[2:54:09] RustyTheCaster: I mean there's no real counters to certain supports, Thresh is good too :)
[2:54:24] PandanPaisen: sounds right
[2:54:28] harrisonju: honestly LPL has no reason to
[2:54:29] michaelsund: Oh boy cant wait for 7.14 to hit in lpl
[2:54:32] rofflepie: they dont need to win worlds, they just need to stomp on NA and EU every game at worlds and ppl will start caring
[2:54:38] harrisonju: but i just can't see them winning worlds
[2:54:42] PandanPaisen: i love playing thresh but i feel like every time i first pick him they just bring out the morg or tahm lol
[2:54:45] RustyTheCaster: Be nice Terrors
[2:54:55] RustyTheCaster: The TK lane isn't that bad for Thresh friend
[2:55:03] RustyTheCaster: it's about the flay not the hook
[2:55:17] grimrevolution: I'm fine with being a reject westerner if I can watch the LPL lol
[2:55:19] PandanPaisen: yeh, it just tilts me to see him gobble everyone up lol
[2:55:24] harrisonju: flash plays with supports are op
[2:55:31] pilgrimage01: UZO
[2:55:39] harrisonju: personally, taric right now is just stupid. You get so many heals
[2:55:41] pilgrimage01: pilavas
[2:55:47] grimrevolution: they're hunting wabbits
[2:56:21] PandanPaisen: i be westerner to but i'm chinese american so i'm biased to lpl x)
[2:56:35] rofflepie: edg also beat h2k 2-0 in the same worlds but no one remembers that
[2:56:40] michaelsund: These Fnc and G2 are not the teams that represent EU today
[2:57:00] rofflepie: not the same worlds
[2:57:01] pilgrimage01: they dont true
[2:57:07] PandanPaisen: 2015
[2:57:22] grimrevolution: #wealllosttoSKT
[2:57:22] harrisonju: how does fnc not represent EU
[2:57:27] michaelsund: @terrorsq ye totaly same team of Msi
[2:57:36] PortableCorpse: rayNLT
[2:57:38] rofflepie: eu keep mentioning fnc edg when edg also beat eu 2-0 in groups, but no one remembers
[2:57:42] michaelsund: Does Fnc still have RO and Huni ?
[2:57:52] grimrevolution: Huni on SKT now
[2:58:04] michaelsund: @rofflepie i mean h2k was third seed
[2:58:15] michaelsund: @terrorsq they are slumping in Eu also
[2:58:28] harrisonju: g2 isn't slumping anymore
[2:58:29] PandanPaisen: to be fair
[2:58:29] grimrevolution: Albus Nox Luna was a fun team to watch though last year
[2:58:41] PortableCorpse: Yeah they were
[2:58:49] rofflepie: i mean, look up every single lpl eu series last 2 years, i bet its still in lpl favor
[2:59:07] michaelsund: emh not really LUL
[2:59:10] harrisonju: look LPL is obviously favorable, the amount of money spent on their rosters is ridiculous
[2:59:12] pilgrimage01: easy game
[2:59:48] harrisonju: you can easily tell the prestige by looking at vegas betting lines, you're often going to see LPL be favored vs any EU/NA team
[3:00:01] PortableCorpse: I wish there were more English broadcasts for the lower tier regions. :(
[3:00:25] rofflepie: g2 lost edg msi, g2 also lost to rng 2nd msi, at worlds fnc did beat edg, but same worlds edg 2-0 h2k in groups
[3:00:27] grimrevolution: My favorite teams and favorite regions depend upon how chaotic they are
[3:00:35] grimrevolution: Which probably explains why I like the LPL
[3:00:35] harrisonju: I think league play would be better with twice as many teams
[3:00:58] michaelsund: @rofflepie yes and Fnc 2 0 Ig that worlds. whats your point
[3:00:58] grimrevolution: @PortableCorpse me too
[3:01:30] PandanPaisen: if i were actually good at this game i would try to cast ljl :^)
[3:01:36] harrisonju: KT just rolled Afreeca
[3:01:45] rofflepie: my point is if u put together every single game eu lpl last 2 years, its prob even, and not gonna bother mention pre 2015 cause lul
[3:01:49] michaelsund: @rofflepie lpl was overall better last year but at s5 worlds lpl got stomped
[3:02:10] harrisonju: being good at the game and being good at casting are probably two different things. CloudTemplar was like diamond tier when he was pro
[3:02:15] grimrevolution: @thewasian0 I'm dissapointed that the only news we heard from the LJL was at rift rivals
[3:02:45] PandanPaisen: yeah but idont think people want to listen to a high gold/low plat like me as caster LOL
[3:02:47] PortableCorpse: I'd love to watch LJL
[3:02:57] PortableCorpse: I speak a little Japanese, but not enough to follow the cast at all. :(
[3:03:08] grimrevolution: And the LMS is growing too
[3:03:16] PandanPaisen: watch more anime kappa
[3:03:24] PortableCorpse: Kappa
[3:03:30] grimrevolution: lol
[3:03:40] rofflepie: implies watching anime helps learn japanese Kappa
[3:03:54] PortableCorpse: It doesn't?
[3:03:57] harrisonju: duolingo is a cool app
[3:03:59] PortableCorpse: Kappa
[3:04:00] PandanPaisen: nah for real thou dont do that the stuff they use in alot of instances is suuuper rude xd
[3:04:00] rofflepie: not really
[3:04:06] JuKeNDiVe: Isn't Rivington Silver
[3:04:17] PortableCorpse: I'm minoring in Japanese in University, major in comp sci
[3:04:22] JuKeNDiVe: pretty sure your elo doesnt matter for casting LMAO
[3:04:24] PandanPaisen: my aunt would wash mah mouth out for some of the stuff they say in some things
[3:04:51] mujarshad: @Funkh ye, but he's been casting forever, he's grandfathered in
[3:04:52] KappaFrankerZXD: >letting your aunt wash your mouth out
[3:04:53] PandanPaisen: mmm idk thou how many gold/plat casters in pro league are there x)
[3:05:02] michaelsund: depends if you are play by play caster or colour
[3:05:13] mlg_rusty_spoon: using the 4chan meme arrow
[3:05:19] JuKeNDiVe: Doesnt matter Casting isnt about having ALL the knowledge
[3:05:26] harrisonju: the people that design the game are like gold-diamond
[3:05:28] PandanPaisen: well she might also break out the odapee stick and smack me to lol
[3:05:35] JuKeNDiVe: Casting is about keeping people enthralled into the game
[3:05:43] harrisonju: there's usually one "fun" guy casting and one analytics
[3:05:49] rofflepie: EU caster doesnt even know u can smite while silenced, the bar is not very high atm
[3:05:55] goblinguy01: Where is MLXG?
[3:06:04] rofflepie: and this is the analyst guy
[3:06:06] grimrevolution: You'd be better off learning the basics of Japanese through something like duolingo and then watching youtubers from that region @PortableCorpse
[3:06:10] RustyTheCaster: mlxd is on the bench
[3:06:13] RustyTheCaster: doesn't work well with uzi
[3:06:17] PandanPaisen: WutFace WutFace
[3:06:21] PortableCorpse: ????
[3:06:31] grimrevolution: To learn Japanese
[3:06:35] mlg_rusty_spoon: uzi made another enemy
[3:06:38] goblinguy01: Oh man. Poor MLXG, did Uzi bench him Kapla
[3:06:38] mujarshad: UZI ASSERTING DOMINANCE Kreygasm
[3:06:39] PandanPaisen: watch kizuna ai :^)
[3:06:39] grimrevolution: Or any language tbh
[3:06:42] goblinguy01: Kappa
[3:07:06] harrisonju: only 5 kills in 22 mins.... is this really rng
[3:07:28] goblinguy01: RNG isn't always "See hero, Kill hero."
[3:07:33] PortableCorpse: I'm rather enjoying my course so far, girm
[3:07:50] PandanPaisen: If I had more time I'd think about it, just to much going on in my life lol
[3:08:06] grimrevolution: Course? Like a class?
[3:08:08] rofflepie: i am thinking about casting NA and EU LCS in chinese on chinese stream sites, but in comedy form
[3:08:13] PortableCorpse: Yeah, grim
[3:08:16] mujarshad: just watch anime to learn japanese VoHiYo
[3:08:34] PortableCorpse: I'm minoring in Japanese at my university, lol
[3:08:39] goblinguy01: ^^ Learn traditional, not slang of any language
[3:08:43] grimrevolution: Oh, lol I've just never taken a class for a language, I've just taught myself. But that's cool!
[3:08:43] PandanPaisen: About to start streaming piano on twitch in addition to teaching, plus college plus my other part time job lol
[3:08:52] mujarshad: @sharpy1095 he was the RNG jungler
[3:08:56] goblinguy01: MLXG is a Jungler of RNG
[3:09:03] mujarshad: but is benched now i guess
[3:09:10] PandanPaisen: flowers is cool
[3:09:16] AlisonWunderland: MLXG is harry potter
[3:09:18] harrisonju: last time i saw mlxg, he was playing hecarim at worlds
[3:09:22] PortableCorpse: Going in to my second semester currently
[3:09:37] PandanPaisen: i actually really like deficio and quickshot lol, they're some of my favoirtes
[3:09:40] mujarshad: Jebaited
[3:09:51] PortableCorpse: I miss Krepo, tbh.
[3:09:57] goblinguy01: This game is over
[3:10:03] harrisonju: yeah most peoplegenerally agree EU/LCK casters are best i think
[3:10:05] PortableCorpse: krepThump
[3:10:09] mujarshad: quickshot, deficio, kobe at RR was so good Kreygasm
[3:10:29] michaelsund: Eu casters are meh except Deficio Quickshot
[3:10:36] PandanPaisen: how about that one dude at all stars lol
[3:10:41] PandanPaisen: that guy was hype
[3:10:43] grimrevolution: I actually find LCK games too boring to watch and it's not the caster's fault it's just that the games aren't that interesting
[3:10:43] harrisonju: lol janna outruns red buff jesus
[3:10:56] mujarshad: @thewasian0 Dash?
[3:10:59] PortableCorpse: I dunno, they can be interesting
[3:11:04] goblinguy01: LpL is LCK but more aggression ^^
[3:11:07] grimrevolution: Granted, Atlus is hilarious and I love the guy
[3:11:14] PandanPaisen: no, he wasnt from one of the big regions
[3:11:18] PandanPaisen: the local one
[3:11:19] grimrevolution: Yeah, exactly @goblibguy01
[3:11:19] goblinguy01: Atlus was an LPL guy
[3:11:24] mujarshad: Ohhhhh
[3:11:25] PortableCorpse: Joe Miller*
[3:11:29] harrisonju: @grimrevolution personal difference i guess. I like how clean LCK is. Teams definitely make less macro game mistakes. Which is like the opposite of EU, but because of the less mistakes I think there's less kills
[3:11:33] michaelsund: @thewasian0 spawn? MingLee
[3:11:46] harrisonju: LGD is awesome to watch cuz they're legit just team fight after teamfight, although not yesterday
[3:11:53] mujarshad: I don't know his name, but yeah, he is awesome
[3:12:19] PortableCorpse: It triggers me that on nights where SpoTV are casting LCK they have no sound at all between games
[3:12:27] goblinguy01: This isn't even an Uzi game, but IMAY passively loosing
[3:12:38] grimrevolution: @Harrisonju That's what I like. I love Chaos. I love teh weird things. Looper picking Swain and Singed when he was on RNG was a highlight and was probably my favorite split by far
[3:12:41] harrisonju: LCK korean casters are fire. But i'm fluent in korean
[3:12:42] PandanPaisen: lol no not spawn
[3:13:33] PandanPaisen: IBAI @mujarshad
[3:13:36] PortableCorpse: brb
[3:13:41] PandanPaisen: that guy
[3:13:49] goblinguy01: Same for Peanut xD
[3:13:57] grimrevolution: I'm not fluent in Korean yet but I'm fluent in Chinese and I like switching between the two casts
[3:14:00] goblinguy01: SKT needs Kakao or Dandy
[3:14:06] PulseIRL: Ming is the lead shotcaller for RNG.
[3:14:15] xniverz: skt go china
[3:14:27] goblinguy01: Yeah
[3:14:41] PulseIRL: Yeah, they picked him up to turn him into a leader next to Uzi
[3:14:47] grimrevolution: Leona + Nocturne games were HYPE last split
[3:14:47] goblinguy01: When Mata left for Korea. Ming had to learn the role
[3:15:00] xniverz: Oh already believe that uzi had died xd
[3:15:15] PandanPaisen: galio lul
[3:15:15] PulseIRL: sks LUL
[3:15:37] grimrevolution: Ming just playing Leona was hype tbh
[3:15:41] f532253947: Road EleGiggle
[3:15:45] grimrevolution: 100% win rate
[3:15:47] harrisonju: casters in LCK in korean are really good imo. They're almost never wrong about their predictions and when they explain some of the stuff teams do i'm just like this game makes sense to me now
[3:15:49] rofflepie: janna saved them...
[3:15:51] xniverz: LOL JANNAXD
[3:16:07] mujarshad: mannnnn
[3:16:16] ceo_at_aldi: take names off of the biggest names BrokeBack
[3:16:18] mujarshad: how does lpl always get kogmaw to late game
[3:16:23] f532253947: Road paid
[3:16:26] thedankbong: all of them have 2 pink wrds
[3:16:35] Kaiseri: Hey Pulse, why was Frosk doing the play by play casting at the begining?
[3:16:37] goblinguy01: LPL was land of ADC ^^
[3:16:47] Kaiseri: *yesterday
[3:16:48] colorblindgenius: they have a mix between lategame and earlygame
[3:16:56] grimrevolution: Skill, the LPL is pretty good at drawing games out cause thet's simply what they do
[3:16:59] goblinguy01: They are use to JuggerMaw builds
[3:17:09] world303: Janna DansGame
[3:17:10] yoooyaaac: -248
[3:17:30] rarepepepls: I love the chaos from LPL
[3:17:41] rofflepie: kogmaw is just tier 1 in lpl, they dont even think it is that bad early and mid
[3:17:44] harrisonju: @terrorsq koreans
[3:17:45] CyanideisJoffrey: Yeah. Whoever the guy is in this... someone at the studio needs to hook him up with a book metaphors so he can stop sounding like a jackwagon.
[3:18:32] CyanideisJoffrey: Watching this stream for five minutes and he's punted at least three so far.
[3:18:42] grimrevolution: You know the LCK fans have arrived when the chat goes from poliet and interesting to shit lol
[3:19:18] thedankbong: TSM would beat all team
[3:19:22] PandanPaisen: if anyone likes piano/ japanese anime music thou check out my channel sometime when i've got everything together :^)
[3:19:30] Zynos_AT: Deft-Overs anyone? LCK got some :)
[3:19:30] Choylokyin: Uzi is back PogChamp
[3:19:40] PandanPaisen: im assuming the kt games ove then lol
[3:19:45] Tking94: Where is MLXG?
[3:19:46] PortableCorpse: I return
[3:19:54] rofflepie: roflmao
[3:20:01] grimrevolution: MLXG is benched
[3:20:02] PortableCorpse: Will DL choke at Worlds again? :(
[3:20:06] Tking94: TSM got 2-0 by Dig
[3:20:06] ng12233266586: Crit LUL
[3:20:07] PandanPaisen: soooo
[3:20:14] mujarshad: tsm got stomped by dig yesterday????
[3:20:21] Rudiko: TSM LUL
[3:20:21] colorblindgenius: yes
[3:20:28] harrisonju: when was the last time TSM made it out of groups at worlds
[3:20:33] Tking94: TSM are good but they didn't play well to the meta
[3:20:37] CyanideisJoffrey: TSM lost to Gravity
[3:20:57] Zynos_AT: DADADADADADADA Uzi SwiftRage
[3:21:00] colorblindgenius: fk tsm this is lpl
[3:21:02] harrisonju: lol uzi flash
[3:21:10] Kaiseri: TSL lost to RNG LUL
[3:21:19] CyanideisJoffrey: Cop with the coaching, Altec with the dps, Keane tilting Bjerg, Hauntzer making solid contributions for the winning team...
[3:21:21] harrisonju: jesus this chat just went 180
[3:21:28] grimrevolution: Uzi is done with everyone's shit lmao
[3:21:36] Zynos_AT: lul
[3:21:38] PortableCorpse: It does that sometimes, Harrison
[3:21:42] PortableCorpse: You just have to roll with it
[3:21:49] colorblindgenius: why is tsm always the matter of the chat
[3:21:49] harrisonju: did uzi have a slump? why the hate for him?
[3:21:57] harrisonju: i thought he was just thought of as LPL's #1 ADC
[3:21:59] mandarinchen20: RNG *__*
[3:22:02] colorblindgenius: holy crap team not gonna make it outof groups
[3:22:13] grimrevolution: Yeah, he was injured
[3:22:21] PortableCorpse: because TSM TSM TSM TSM or something idk
[3:22:22] grimrevolution: He had health problems at the end of last split
[3:22:26] Rudiko: uzi just cant win anything
[3:22:30] Kaiseri: Because TSM is the best team of all times haHAA
[3:22:34] Rudiko: except the 1v1 tournament
[3:22:38] harrisonju: i heard he's had wrist issues for a while, but people were hating on him for some reason
[3:22:49] CyanideisJoffrey: Was it anything serious or just repetitive stress injury?
[3:22:52] grimrevolution: Uzi is consistently at the top of the ADC list but he's never been #1
[3:22:53] Zynos_AT: uzi holding ulti the whole time Kreygasm
[3:23:10] harrisonju: oh really? in korea, people thought of uzi as #1 adc
[3:23:12] grimrevolution: Because sometimes he jumps into five people and pops like a balloon
[3:23:15] xniverz: Deft>Bang>Uzi>Ruler>Pray
[3:23:17] PortableCorpse: To be fair, fans will look for almost any reason to shit on someone
[3:23:18] harrisonju: in china, at least
[3:23:24] ceo_at_aldi: deft LUL
[3:23:25] PortableCorpse: or well, some fans
[3:23:30] rofflepie: deft lul
[3:23:36] Zynos_AT: bonkbonk>uzi
[3:23:41] harrisonju: the debate when samsung won worlds was UZI = Deft = Bang for a while
[3:23:42] Zynos_AT: boxSENPAI boxSENPAI
[3:23:49] grimrevolution: Uzi is amazing, he just demands so much resources but he can carry you no problem
[3:23:54] rofflepie: there is a reason uzi has never won a tourament before
[3:24:10] harrisonju: he tilts like no other?
[3:24:13] Kxmx_Rin: They'll fade away? and classify themselfes as Obsolete
[3:24:16] Zynos_AT: team holding him back BibleThump
[3:24:18] harrisonju: he's like chinese imp
[3:24:19] world303: He liked that position KappaPride
[3:24:25] grimrevolution: No, he's just got superstar status so he's camped
[3:24:33] grimrevolution: Constantly
[3:24:34] rofflepie: he doesnt tilt, but he tilts his teammates
[3:24:42] grimrevolution: ^true
[3:24:42] Zynos_AT: he seems like a flamer tho, or at least has
[3:24:42] rofflepie: he palys well most of the time
[3:24:49] PortableCorpse: But is he full Dardoch team tilt?
[3:24:50] grimrevolution: He's gotten better

[3:25:18] Kinfles: KappaPride
[3:25:18] rofflepie: rng with uzi, never won anyways, rng with wuxx, won lpl, won demacia cup, rng with y4 won rift rivals
[3:25:35] michaelsund: ThunBeast TheThing ?
[3:25:36] 厉害大王: Xiaohu=GAY
[3:25:38] harrisonju: i don't think you can blame one player for a team not doing well
[3:25:47] thedankbong: wait is xiahu gay?
[3:25:52] PandanPaisen: um\
[3:25:52] goblinguy01: It's a pattern Kappa
[3:25:57] rofflepie: not blaming him, he jsut doesnt mesh with his team and they play way worse
[3:26:02] world303: mlxg FeelsBadMan
[3:26:11] grimrevolution: @Harrisonju yeah, I agree. I just think RNG play best around their midlane rather than their botlane
[3:26:12] PandanPaisen: why have i returned to a chat filled with KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride
[3:26:14] rofflepie: it might be a resource thing, might be a team enviroment thing, might be a style thing
[3:26:16] mujarshad: wow
[3:26:22] harrisonju: hmm you might know better since i don't watch LPL as much
[3:26:22] rofflepie: but there has been 4 years of sample size now
[3:26:23] deerparkfish: @rofflepie lol with uzi second place at worlds twice
[3:26:27] deerparkfish: thats pretty good
[3:26:30] goblinguy01: Wuxx is a team player
[3:26:34] deerparkfish: better than all those things you said
[3:26:38] songwilliam: uzi
[3:26:39] harrisonju: honestly, at this time and the streamers tone just puts me to sleep
[3:26:41] goblinguy01: Uzi isn't
[3:27:03] songwilliam: uzi is the emperor of china
[3:27:04] rofflepie: thats not winning, chinese people acutally hated him for kocking out omg at season 3 worlds
[3:27:06] harrisonju: idk the last time i've seen amazingj play good jesus
[3:27:10] letsgankyi: 小虎= gay
[3:27:46] deerparkfish: @rofflepie 2nd best team in the world is way better than winning any of those things you said
[3:27:55] goblinguy01: We aren't saying if Wuxx was playing on Royal Club in S3/S4, they would win worlds. Wuxx seems to perform as a whole
[3:27:59] songwilliam: because uzi is a super star, wuxx isnt
[3:28:14] world303: @Terrorsq who replaced wuxx?
[3:28:18] grimrevolution: Wuxx was a role player which is what RNG needed
[3:28:20] harrisonju: wow RNG and OMG are the only two teams in LPL with only chinese rosters
[3:28:22] songwilliam: uzi is the king
[3:28:24] grimrevolution: Uzi replaced him
[3:28:26] goblinguy01: This game isn't a good example. Imay are a bad team
[3:28:29] CyanideisJoffrey: @rofflepie S3 OMG vs SKT might have been four games instead of three.
[3:28:34] rofflepie: clearly not when uzi constantly mentions that he never won anything, and chinese rags on him forever for never winning anyways
[3:28:42] rshawer: Neither wuxx or y4 are so good in lane and in LPL winning lane is super important especially the botlane. No one knows how to macro for shit
[3:28:43] michaelsund: @harrisonju better than none MingLee
[3:28:54] goblinguy01: Uzi can play Vayne and they will 2-0 IMAY
[3:29:23] grimrevolution: Uzi has lost more with Vayne than any other champ lol
[3:29:30] songwilliam: uzi has the insurmountable fans in china you cant imagine he is the king
[3:29:35] rofflepie: xiaohu and mlxg plays way worse when uzi is playing, i am not saying uzi is the whole reason to blame, but there is something there not clicking
[3:29:52] goblinguy01: IMAY are bad, Uzi doesn't need to try for Xiahou to win this game
[3:30:05] songwilliam: yes
[3:30:05] rofflepie: lol, i am chinese and i read chinese forum more than reddit, uzi is popular but he is not all positive like u think
[3:30:06] PandanPaisen: Jared Vayne Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:30:11] harrisonju: didn't uzi carry rng vs IG last time?
[3:30:11] grimrevolution: It's because he demands so many resources
[3:30:13] roychas: One of
[3:30:14] letsgankyi: uzi hava never get any team champion
[3:30:21] rshawer: Xiaohu played pretty well last split. Last split was less RNG playing worse, but WE being better
[3:30:31] rshawer: Seriously WE actually knew how to play macro
[3:30:45] thedankbong: fkin idiots uzi win 1v1
[3:30:56] decco41: VoHiYo PunOko VoHiYo PunOko VoHiYo PunOko VoHiYo
[3:30:59] rofflepie: before easeon 6, it was clearlove 100% being most popular, nowadays there is no clear most popular
[3:31:00] songwilliam: uzi seems like a prince chubby face
[3:31:01] letsgankyi: team champion i mean
[3:31:04] roychas: Lol say world should give uzi a champion
[3:31:05] goblinguy01: World had the best macro in S2 and 7 months without dropping a Map. They fell off in late S3 before worlds until s5

[3:33:09] letsgankyi: yeah
[3:33:10] goblinguy01: Uzi might be the best Chinese adc after WeiXiao in International. We all know that isn't true
[3:33:12] songwilliam: uzi is the most

[3:33:59] rofflepie: someone bring frosk in here
[3:34:03] goblinguy01: S4, NaMei was the best Adc

[3:34:25] rofflepie: frosk had a HUGE rant yesterday about how uzi was never the best lpl adc, at any time
[3:34:25] songwilliam: a million
[3:34:27] goblinguy01: S5, Deft/Imp were the best ADC
[3:34:34] harrisonju: who cares who has more fans lol
[3:34:35] roychas: Wei xiao don't play any more
[3:34:48] harrisonju: you can be a bad player and be good looking and a shit load of fans too
[3:34:48] goblinguy01: I've been am Lpl fan since S3 and I know Uzi wasn't the best in S4

[3:36:00] goblinguy01: Who else can carry EP to an LPL title?
[3:36:08] Zynos_AT: ??
[3:36:09] CyanideisJoffrey: Pyl fell off really hard.

[3:36:36] letsgankyi: yeah
[3:36:40] harrisonju: he didn't play in their last game
[3:37:04] goblinguy01: @rshawer Uhh. Doesn't that mean every World class ADC who plays bad at worlds is bad
[3:37:13] goblinguy01: Like DL, Reckless
[3:37:22] harrisonju: DL is kind of bad tho
[3:37:23] grimrevolution: Eyyy, they switched to the thresh figurine
[3:37:28] harrisonju: now at least
[3:37:38] Zynos_AT: Rekkless PogChamp xPeke PogChamp
[3:37:43] harrisonju: that was also like 5 years ago
[3:37:47] mujarshad: DL is bad BrokeBack
[3:37:47] Zynos_AT: xPeke S3 PogChamp
[3:37:53] harrisonju: azubu frost was a thing back then
[3:37:55] Zynos_AT: malphite mid, nidalee mid PogChamp
[3:37:59] harrisonju: or were they mig
[3:37:59] rofflepie: how can dl be consider world best adc when chaox is seaseon 2 mvp Kappa
[3:38:05] Zynos_AT: POGCHAMP PogChamp
[3:38:09] goblinguy01: Azubu Frost had a bad Adc
[3:38:17] letsgankyi: mlxg
[3:38:24] grimrevolution: Harry Potter has come back
[3:38:25] goblinguy01: Azubu got exposed by TPA
[3:38:31] harrisonju: really in korea, we compared imp to uzi
[3:38:35] michaelsund: @terrorsq if by people you mean NA fanboys MingLee
[3:38:42] harrisonju: supports have to manage them mentally
[3:38:47] CyanideisJoffrey: Woong was a jobber
[3:39:02] rofflepie: asian teams dont really think about doublelift at all
[3:39:12] letsgankyi: how do you guys read mlxg?
[3:39:12] grimrevolution: @Harrisonju I mean, Uzi is probably the best ADC in lane and he could definitely take it to Deft when Deft was on EDG
[3:39:18] goblinguy01: They don't care about their own Kappa
[3:39:19] CyanideisJoffrey: Maybe if Frost had an average ADC they would have won S2
[3:39:21] harrisonju: I like uzi
[3:39:27] harrisonju: i think he's really good
[3:39:30] grimrevolution: Same
[3:39:38] harrisonju: i don't think dobulelift is even above average
[3:39:43] letsgankyi: Peng Yiliang
[3:39:44] grimrevolution: He's probably my favorite player next to Mata and Looper
[3:39:46] goblinguy01: No. Shy got outplayed by Stanley and LilBallz
[3:39:53] rofflepie: just read it mlxg, but if u want how chinese pronounce it it is MaLaXiangGuo, try ur best to phonics that
[3:40:12] harrisonju: same thing about you and doublelift
[3:40:26] grimrevolution: I haven't watched Rekkles play since... the last time he was at worlds
[3:40:28] harrisonju: he's just one step away from being imaqtpie now
[3:40:37] f00tfungus: Who was rng support before Ming?
[3:40:41] harrisonju: also i never said anything about rekkles
[3:40:43] rofflepie: mata
[3:40:44] grimrevolution: Mata

[4:20:18] grimrevolution: I had to do actual work for five minutes and miss more than I wanted

[4:22:44] PulseIRL: @rofflepie hmm I see, maybe I should just get a consultation to see if what I'm doing is actually good
[4:23:23] PulseIRL: @grimrevolution We don't reach out, we're given offers from the producers on the show
[4:23:43] grimrevolution: Ahh, okay, thanks!
[4:23:50] PapaSmithy: as a freelancer and not a rioter you usually reach out and inquire if there is interest
[4:24:09] rofflepie: when u cut, no matter how u cut u r bound to lose muscle along with fat, its just a ratio thing, same thing as gaining, u cant gain pure muscle, so typically u want to be a bit buffer than ur final goal, then when u cut, u'll lose some small maount of msucle too, ending up at where ur ideal goal is
[4:24:29] rofflepie: screw u wtf LOL
[4:24:31] grimrevolution: That's interesting, do most freelance casters reach out or no?

[4:59:39] grimrevolution: I know but just
[4:59:42] rofflepie: This is exactly why I hate Galio. This ult is pure unadulterated, 100% cancer. Nobody has a single, new counter to it, all spouting the latest strategy to it, that aren't even good. THIS is why I'm turning off league and will just watch the professional play. And I swear to god, if any of you copy and paste this, I'm deleting annie forever.
[4:59:43] MisakiKureha: Nice english man SeemsGood

[5:03:29] rofflepie: WE memes are the most simple but best memes
[5:03:31] pnkuU: when u watch lpl, no matter how u watch lpl u r bound to lose brain cells along with sanity, its just a ratio thing, same thing as watching NA, u cant gain pure macro game, so typically u want to be a bit smarter than ur final goal, then when u watch lpl, u'll lose some small maount of brain cells too, ending up at where ur ideal goal is
[5:03:40] rofflepie: like congratulation WE
[5:04:04] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: LPL teams understand the value of their own league, they don't perform at Worlds because it is an inferior tournament that doesn't deserve them at their best
