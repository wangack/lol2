[0:58:41] DefyPhysics: NARUTO VS MAGNUS CARLSEN
[0:58:55] nemostreamo: a fetus is still better than west
[0:59:04] wyzrdsnvrdie: why as much people dont watch lpl compared to lck
[0:59:18] demonic55: naruto has no chances vs magnus
[0:59:25] NahDawgDatAintMe: Are we even sure Jackylove exists?
[1:00:02] nemostreamo: honestly no
[1:00:08] DefyPhysics: SHIKAMARU VS MAGNUS CARLSEN
[1:00:13] nemostreamo: he might just be a myth
[1:00:14] NahDawgDatAintMe: @montekrepo I can't speak for everyone, but it's way past midnight on the east coast of NA.
[1:00:36] TrendNation69: @montekrepo there are independent Chinese and Korean streams so twitch numbers are not an accurate representation of viewership
[1:00:54] nysportsdominate: more ppl watch lck because it's better league lol
[1:00:58] FishRoeSoup: lpl player would jump of military base and lck viewers r douchbags finding some sneaky villiges with few houses
[1:01:08] wyzrdsnvrdie: Yeah but lck airs later than this and usually 10-15,000 American viewers vs the 1000 watching lpl
[1:01:11] Tubbbbbbbs: is dorans a new thing with jhin?
[1:01:23] wyzrdsnvrdie: its for spell spam
[1:01:23] niFFFF: !status
[1:01:33] TrendNation69: yeah but lck is pretty boring
[1:01:34] niFFFF: !stats
[1:01:41] Tubbbbbbbs: ahh. thx
[1:01:41] absolwave: lck has more western viewers but lpl has more domestic viewers cuz they have the biggest playerbase
[1:01:42] nemostreamo: yes, the mana regen is valuable and Q has an AP ratio
[1:02:20] nemostreamo: also it restores FOUR mana per kill, so you need to buy it on jhin
[1:02:47] wyzrdsnvrdie: @nysportsdominate based on msi and rift rivals i thibk it's arguable lpl is even or better that's why i ask
[1:02:59] wyzrdsnvrdie: ah @anele_world_only_hope yeah i think youre right
[1:03:37] TrendNation69: @montekrepo I think LCK is still but best region but LPL is def 2nd
[1:03:46] TrendNation69: which a lot of people don't like to admit
[1:03:48] demonic55: brand deals more damage than jhin

[1:05:25] savior78: LPL is actual trash...
[1:05:33] TacosWillPronUs: LUL
[1:05:33] wyzrdsnvrdie: yeah and theres huge skill gap in top and lower teams
[1:05:46] savior78: LMS > LPL
[1:05:52] TrendNation69: NA can't make it out of groups @terrorsq
[1:06:08] wyzrdsnvrdie: LPL always outperform NA and EU at worlds these trolls are silly lol
[1:06:10] xayah_for_dinner: If LPL is trash what does that make NA and EU
[1:06:17] TrendNation69: then what happened to C9!

[1:06:26] FishRoeSoup: NA #10 team 4-2 EU LUL
[1:06:27] nemostreamo: top teams in every region outside of the top 3 korean teams are really close
[1:06:38] TacosWillPronUs: Nice trophies EU 4Head
[1:06:52] TrendNation69: At least they managed to take a game
[1:06:54] slayerwarx: EU 1 worlds vs NA 0 worlds title
[1:07:00] savior78: no @FishRoeSoup
[1:07:09] nemostreamo: its really really depressing that one of SKT/KT/LZ/SSG will not make worlds
[1:07:09] savior78: Mike yueng 4-2 eu Kappa
[1:07:11] wyzrdsnvrdie: lol @sephultur is def a troll

[1:08:16] DefyPhysics: What happened to Duke he used to be #1 top
[1:08:22] absolwave: in theory that last shot wasn't terrible but... it missed so bad
[1:08:27] savior78: he moved to lpl defy
[1:08:30] wyzrdsnvrdie: maybe pre season 5 yeah
[1:08:33] nemostreamo: i dont even think duke was top 3 top laners ni the world
[1:08:46] FishRoeSoup: LUL LEE FLASH
[1:08:57] TacosWillPronUs: 3rd seat 🤔
[1:09:00] nemostreamo: ssumday and smeb were better than duke
[1:09:07] FishRoeSoup: na <3 eu LUL
[1:09:18] NahDawgDatAintMe: @dubu_dubu They are still better than Duke
[1:09:30] nemostreamo: that is true, a lot of top laners are better than duke now
[1:09:44] savior78: im better than duke
[1:09:57] TrendNation69: What happened to the 1st and 2nd seed? @terrorsq
[1:10:06] NahDawgDatAintMe: He's good at pure laning but his slow tps are starting to hurt him
[1:10:09] TacosWillPronUs: This is a pretty mediocre attempt at flaming
[1:10:12] savior78: TSM was in hardest group
[1:10:18] FishRoeSoup: EU fanboi spotted LUL
[1:10:23] wyzrdsnvrdie: right now best top laner world is probably SSG top i forget name
[1:10:29] savior78: H2K was in the only group without a korean AND NA team
[1:10:30] f532253947: no let him talk CoolStoryBob
[1:10:33] blindautisticcat: Cuvee?
[1:10:40] nemostreamo: khan on longzhu is playing the best probably
[1:10:51] TrendNation69: @savior78 I mean I agree that H2K shouldn't have made it out either
[1:10:53] nemostreamo: you actually have to 100% ban his jayce
[1:10:55] carlinhoshk: gg suporte bronze nao compra pedra da visao
[1:11:05] blindautisticcat: Yea Khan is probably the best top rn
[1:11:17] Osteoid: Xiyang?
[1:11:24] dahtguy: LOL
[1:11:29] absolwave: tbh i think all of longzhu's top side is probably the strongest in the region
[1:11:32] NahDawgDatAintMe: What's with the Kogmaw priority in LPL? I don't see other regions playing it.
[1:11:41] FishRoeSoup: edg lost to h2k twice while EU #1 seed got disqualified by a wildcard LUL
[1:11:53] TrendNation69: LongZhu has the best bot lane
[1:12:05] nemostreamo: longzhu is just the best team in the world right now
[1:12:07] wyzrdsnvrdie: LPL likes to temfight late game so kog.is a strong pick for that
[1:12:09] savior78: whos best LCK jungler
[1:12:18] wyzrdsnvrdie: kogmaw*
[1:12:20] nemostreamo: probably Score
[1:12:29] absolwave: cuzz/score are top 2
[1:12:32] slayerwarx: I miss insec
[1:12:37] BlazingHigh: Bless Kappa
[1:12:38] blindautisticcat: Ya score is probably #1
[1:12:39] NahDawgDatAintMe: Score is the safe answer but nobody is the clear front runner
[1:12:40] savior78: right answer is rush
[1:12:41] absolwave: i think score is usually strongest but cuzz has looked rlly good
[1:12:42] nemostreamo: isnt insec rotting in the LSPL
[1:12:51] slayerwarx: yup
[1:12:55] nemostreamo: yeah right now there are no absolutely dominant junglers in korea
[1:13:20] nemostreamo: but i think its easy to say BDD is the best mid
[1:13:21] Osteoid: PogChamp
[1:13:24] FishRoeSoup: nice gank LUL
[1:13:24] nameless_typhlosion: LUL
[1:13:27] absolwave: blank was v strong but has kind of faltered
[1:13:32] NahDawgDatAintMe: They are either all absurdly good or average. I'm hoping they are just average but I'm going to be disappointed.
[1:13:34] blindautisticcat: bdd is playing the best right now
[1:13:40] fepl_: Cuzz overrated, gets hardcore carried by his team.
[1:13:44] nemostreamo: build a mejais Five PogChamp
[1:13:46] f532253947: ning lee MingLee
[1:13:55] wyzrdsnvrdie: i think NA has good junglers tbh, at least they make good early game plays that i think other regions dont go for
[1:13:56] savior78: world championship should have parts
[1:13:57] phortonomio: He didn't have flash
[1:14:11] savior78: 1st part is the 3 korean teams vs each other first place
[1:14:16] xayah_for_dinner: MEGAN?
[1:14:17] nemostreamo: i think they are all pretyt average, i believe they got used to Jungle being so overpowered last season
[1:14:22] xayah_for_dinner: THERES FEMALE?
[1:14:23] savior78: second is rest of world for 2nd Kappa
[1:14:26] blindautisticcat: dude bdd has a 11 kd, that's insane
[1:14:33] nemostreamo: no, megan is just the worlds skinniest dude
[1:14:43] wyzrdsnvrdie: xsmithie playing like a god right now
[1:15:05] xayah_for_dinner: imo xmithie can carry IMT into finals
[1:15:18] TrendNation69: that's basically what it is @savior78
[1:15:29] TrendNation69: how far can you go before you run into a Korean team
[1:15:35] slayerwarx: and loss to tsm

[1:15:51] TrendNation69: Yes @galatheus
[1:15:58] xayah_for_dinner: I don't think Xmithie is gonna out-shine svenskeren
[1:16:17] savior78: LOL true trend
[1:16:27] Osteoid: Wow Ning got lucky
[1:16:36] savior78: i think fnatic and TSM will have good showings this year
[1:16:45] Galatheus: Thanks @trendnation69, that explains the Duskblade
[1:16:53] TrendNation69: I don't think he needed to ult
[1:17:00] xayah_for_dinner: EU probably gonna be the worst region at Worlds
[1:17:03] wyzrdsnvrdie: dude Sven is shit on international stage he'll ruin tsm chances at getting out of groups
[1:17:07] NahDawgDatAintMe: I think this year will mimic 2014 worlds.
[1:17:18] TrendNation69: @savior78 let's see if the can make it out of groups first
[1:17:27] xayah_for_dinner: im just hyped for KT

[2:56:20] 420juicelord69: and it could add to anyone else on the team other than the ad, but it's pretty certain that all of tahms cs added to caits so far

[5:30:39] scottoflorida2014: You are not allowed to smoke pre 18 get it right
[5:30:41] lilmaune: i dont know what you mean @neonpinku but my point was that jeep seems like a wierd brand to be comercialised in LPL but idk maybe they makes lot of sales of it
[5:30:42] FEBI_SIM_CARD_WAS_STOLEN: not like drinking age restriction stops anyone
