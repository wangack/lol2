[0:04:37] edgelordweeb: Snake NotLikeThis
[0:07:45] definitely_Diana: hiii
[0:11:39] Spentacular13: Hello 42 viewers
[0:12:21] KaaOz1987: sad there is so few viewers on LPL, the caster is doing a good job tho
[0:23:10] PulseIRL: PogChamp //
[0:23:51] CasterFroskurinn: Party over here
[0:26:06] vlz00: StoneLightning StoneLightning
[0:27:00] CasterFroskurinn: 4 points
[0:27:04] PulseIRL: 4
[0:27:06] PulseIRL: F O U R
[0:27:08] CasterFroskurinn: you boosted animal
[0:27:20] Munchinsteaks: LOL
[0:48:11] grimrevolution: it's cause KT is bullying huni on the LCK stream
[0:48:24] CasterFroskurinn: A lot of our viewership is in VoD's
[0:48:24] ligatvliga: How many minutes ago the stream is started?
[0:48:26] CDMLoL: i mean can you blame them
[0:49:05] CasterFroskurinn: BUT LOOK AT THAT 1080P
[0:49:09] ligatvliga: How many minutes ago the stream is started?
[0:49:14] grimrevolution: It's beautiful
[0:49:25] grimrevolution: 10-15 minutes ago
[0:50:30] grimrevolution: Wait, why is the viewership mostly in the vods?
[0:50:42] CasterFroskurinn: because of timezone
[0:50:48] CasterFroskurinn: most of our viewers are NA
[0:50:57] chrysopelea: SKT and KT hyped right now
[0:51:14] grimrevolution: Ah, that makes sense
[0:52:04] CasterFroskurinn: We have some cool stuff planned, so surely we'll cotninue to build a kick ass broadcast for everyone :)
[0:53:23] grimrevolution: Nice!
[0:55:28] grimrevolution: I think as long as the metal isn't split pushing the LPL has a good chance
[0:55:35] KptBoredom: listening to telecom war game 3, watching lpl sneakyFiesta
[0:56:10] grimrevolution: The region was exposed when split pushing was the strat and while some teams like 2016 RNG was good at making you fight them, most of the LPL strength are in team fighting
[0:58:36] 鳳梨皇帝: 63 LUL
[0:59:24] araby: 365 viewrs LUL LPL dead region
[0:59:49] grimrevolution: I dunno about that, I mean I don't watch the LCK enough and the last time we saw the LPL and LCK clash was in Rift Rivals. Even then, though, it wasn't in a best of 5 one team vs one team
[1:00:13] chrysopelea: WE lost to G2 LUL
[1:00:15] CasterFroskurinn: They test different things
[1:00:21] grimrevolution: It was five teams vs. five teams in best of ones? So we don't actually really know if the LCK has an answer or not
[1:00:25] CasterFroskurinn: the relay Bo5 ws a format used in starcraft
[1:00:39] grimrevolution: I really liked that format tbh
[1:00:52] mcrdisco: that format is shit
[1:00:55] sir_meow_: meme free chat Kreygasm
[1:00:58] mcrdisco: tbh
[1:00:58] CasterFroskurinn: and tests things like mind games, improv, adaptability. And effectively beat the LCK coaches collectively by having a better read on their order and draft
[1:01:22] CasterFroskurinn: EDG showed their notes and got SSG draft almost perfect, they also knew SSG would be the first and wanted EDG to face them. Then won.
[1:01:53] grimrevolution: Yeah! Which was impressive seeing that they lost to them in the group stage
[1:01:59] CasterFroskurinn: People try to say that it wasn't impressive what LPL did, but it was. They didn't just sandbag OMG vs SKT and then crush the bottom LCK teams - they went through the best to beat the best. Was it a bo5? No. But it wasn't nothing.
[1:02:26] CasterFroskurinn: It showed that LCK are vulnerable and that LPL are contenders - not that LPL are the best.
[1:02:57] sir_meow_: But RR was on a new patch tho*
[1:03:03] mujarshad: LPL won rift rivals FailFish they are the best FailFish cmon frosk FailFish
[1:03:06] grimrevolution: I think it also showed how much these teams can improve over a tournament. Just looking at RNG at the beginning to the end was impressive
[1:03:17] CasterFroskurinn: " It showed that LCK are vulnerable and that LPL are contenders - not that LPL are the best."
[1:03:31] CasterFroskurinn: "not that LPL are the best."
[1:03:42] sir_meow_: Do you think it's a big advantage t be the underdog ?
[1:03:48] mujarshad: LPL ARE THE BEST SwiftRage
[1:03:50] CasterFroskurinn: I DONT WANT THIS MISQUOTED ON SOCIALS
[1:03:51] CDMLoL: "LPL are the best"
[1:03:56] CasterFroskurinn: lol
[1:03:57] KptBoredom: inb4 lpl wins worlds now
[1:03:58] mcrdisco: NOT THAT LPL ARE BEST
[1:04:14] mcrdisco: na winning world's
[1:04:21] CasterFroskurinn: that'll show 'em
[1:04:25] PulseIRL: lpl are the best TehePelo
[1:04:32] xlchen1128: wait until October
[1:04:34] CDMLoL: just keep savaging kt fans and most people will look past it im sure
[1:04:38] mujarshad: "[...] LPL are the best." - Froskurinn, 2k17
[1:04:48] CasterFroskurinn: mercy
[1:04:59] xlchen1128: hopefully there would be interesting matches in worlds
[1:05:02] KptBoredom: lpl > lck > na > eu >oce > lpl >lck >na
[1:05:12] xlchen1128: not all Korean showdown.
[1:05:27] mcrdisco: @kptboredom oce>eu
[1:06:15] CasterFroskurinn: I don't think so. I don't know what you're implying when you mean "LPL Comp" - LPL has a higher priority on Kog Maw, still more than any other global region. But engage comps are just really strong right now in general; I don't think that implies that LPL have a better read on the meta - just that the meta shifted into a lot of team's comfort
[1:06:39] KptBoredom: @mcrdisco oce > lpl > lck
[1:06:40] mujarshad: DansGame ING do the baron
[1:06:59] xlchen1128: there has not been a non Korean team to beat another since S4 OMG VS NJS. Thus, I hope someone could beat that.
[1:07:00] CDMLoL: DW only < SKT Kappa
[1:07:00] mcrdisco: chat is better in lpl
[1:07:08] grimrevolution: Actually, I have a question @CasterFroskurinn With the rise of tanks do you think that there will be a higher priority for the champs that melt them like the Vayne and Malzahar? or is Uzi the only one anyone sees actually picking it up?
[1:07:14] mcrdisco: but games more interesting in lck
[1:07:22] KptBoredom: @mcrdisco nobody wins worlds, every team gets a smaller trophy
[1:07:27] CasterFroskurinn: @grimrevolution yes! We've already seen their rise!
[1:07:51] grimrevolution: For real? Wait, has vayne been played again? where?
[1:07:53] mujarshad: Weeber's wall VoHiYo
[1:08:01] grimrevolution: Caue Uzi played it against WE I know
[1:08:03] CasterFroskurinn: @Dylanklebold91181 Kalista was a high priority everywhere due to how she empowered engage supports.
[1:08:18] CDMLoL: Ok ok, Vayne is a reach too far
[1:08:28] CDMLoL: Malzahar on the other hand, someone needs to spam that shit
[1:08:31] xlchen1128: Uzi played VN against WE@grimrevolution
[1:08:34] grimrevolution: You say that, but Uzi played her last week lol
[1:08:53] CasterFroskurinn: And WE played Malz. And more teams are picking up Varus for shred
[1:09:08] grimrevolution: @Xlchen1128 Yeah, I know I was wondering if she'd been played anywhere else
[1:09:15] grimrevolution: Ahh, Yeah Varus, forgot about Varus
[1:09:47] CasterFroskurinn: Perkz, Faker, Xiye were all scriming Lucian mid during MSI
[1:09:59] CasterFroskurinn: it was just Xiye that brought it out first on stage, but technically Faker was first in scrims
[1:10:19] haypah: DieMay lul
[1:10:20] grimrevolution: Xiaohu played him first didn't he? I think I remember him playing it during an RNG game in spring
[1:10:48] CasterFroskurinn: Don't get me wrong, I love the LPL! But their strength has never been on meta read and more so just throwing the meta out and doing what they do!
[1:11:15] CasterFroskurinn: Xiaohu played him when the game ment nothing and he'd played it the year before so hsi team allowed it - but as an actual counter it was being scrimmed at MSI
[1:11:21] mujarshad: fighting all game long Kreygasm
[1:11:35] grimrevolution: Ahhh okay, thanks
[1:11:48] Team_Vertex: @CasterFroskurinn VoHiYo
[1:11:58] CasterFroskurinn: <3
[1:12:54] CasterFroskurinn: I tipped Imay - WHY DAN WHY
[1:14:01] grimrevolution: The dandom is strong lol
[1:14:50] grimrevolution: What a meta when you lose two tanks and still have one left lmao
[1:16:20] wowan116: dan loose this game, dan so strong? NotLikeThis
[1:17:00] Dimsum93: wow no replay on that braum ult?
[1:17:12] CasterFroskurinn: I have concerns about Kayn bridging into mid and late game and think he'd really suffer in LCK due to that since a lot of those teams have a much stronger understanding about mid game vision plays.
[1:17:19] CasterFroskurinn: But we'll see! I'd love to see more Kayn.
[1:17:47] CasterFroskurinn: PLEASE IMAY
[1:17:51] CasterFroskurinn: MOMMY NEEDS THE TIPS
[1:18:56] wowan116: З22 in LoL :(
[1:20:36] Dimsum93: froskurinn do u speak icelandic?
[1:20:55] CasterFroskurinn: I studied it for a bit. :) It's how I got my name. I know some animals.
[1:21:42] Dimsum93: oh i see
[1:21:48] Dimsum93: ever been to iceland?
[1:21:54] CasterFroskurinn: yes!
[1:22:10] CasterFroskurinn: I plan on living there one day. It is the long-term goal: do esports. get money. live in iceland.
[1:22:26] KptBoredom: that's a nice goal
[1:22:45] CDMLoL: frosk leaving planning on leaving oce is a feelsbadman
[1:23:13] CasterFroskurinn: Sydney is one the greatest cities I've ever lived in - gorgeous here for sure. Love 'Straya
[1:23:43] CasterFroskurinn: I'll probably work in China someday and I've spent a lot of time there
[1:24:23] CasterFroskurinn: And the food in Shanghai is top percent
[1:24:50] grimrevolution: Do you think the LPL english casters will ever go to China instead of just going over there during finals? Or will it stay as it is?
[1:25:12] grimrevolution: That's true, the food in shanghai is amazing
[1:25:29] CasterFroskurinn: Yes, the goal has always been to get the broadcast into China.
[1:25:35] Gunerdrag: @CasterFroskurinn i saw you getting asian food a couple days ago PogChamp
[1:25:40] CDMLoL: LPL broadcast is in Sydney
[1:25:55] CDMLoL: Different site to OPL tho
[1:26:16] CasterFroskurinn: We used to share the studio with OPL but then they moved to competing days, so we had to split the broadcast teams
[1:26:19] grimrevolution: Is there any reason why it's not? If you can't answer that's cool too it's just interesting that it's streamed to you all in Australia
[1:26:39] chairmong: @CasterFroskurinn i saw you getting din tai fung on monday
[1:26:58] CasterFroskurinn: @Johncx Say "hi" next time!
[1:27:08] Gunerdrag: Johncx is anti-social as fuck

[1:32:42] Zeltion: k good thanks
[1:32:52] grimrevolution: lol I think most people are slowly waking up realizing someone won
[1:32:52] PulseIRL: no one won
[1:33:06] CasterFroskurinn: if the game goes over 50 minutes, everyone lost.
[1:33:09] CDMLoL: the only winner in that was frosk
[1:33:10] bigfatlp: 280 viewers 4Head feels like tier 4 csgo tournament games Kreygasm
[1:33:47] grimrevolution: @CasterFroskurinn what does that say for EU then?
[1:33:48] CasterFroskurinn: I think Snake tanked Kayne's win rate in LPL tho
[1:33:54] CasterFroskurinn: @grimrevolution ;)
[1:33:59] jarvitz: @casterfroskurinn jarvitHi jarvitHi jarvitHi jarvitHi jarvitHi jarvitHi
[1:34:12] CasterFroskurinn: It's good ol' Jarvitz
[1:34:21] jarvitz: hi!

[1:34:45] jarvitz: instead of me being up still I went to bed and woke up

[1:35:04] Gunerdrag: PogChamp
[1:35:15] jarvitz: she is from indiana (sorry frosk)
[1:35:22] CasterFroskurinn: Drakos and I were friends before esports and we basically are the same person. Both from Portland. Both hipsters.
[1:35:55] grimrevolution: That... explains a lot actually
[1:35:55] jarvitz: that's cool tbh
[1:36:09] jarvitz: now tell me... what is this friend thing
[1:36:19] jarvitz: Kappa
[1:36:35] Gunerdrag: @CasterFroskurinn u mean Tespha?
[1:36:36] CasterFroskurinn: It's where you go outside and do things near-ish other people
[1:36:46] CasterFroskurinn: I told him that was a dumb name day 1
[1:36:56] CasterFroskurinn: Queen le Tsepha
[1:37:06] jarvitz: lol
[1:37:50] KptBoredom: only time i ever go do anything near-ish people is for this one weekend in july where nerds from across the world flock to my hometown for SDCC
[1:38:21] grimrevolution: have you two ever casted together btw? You and Drakos?
[1:39:28] jarvitz: btw what is everyone's opinion on this emote jarvitHi
[1:40:01] CasterFroskurinn: @grimrevolution yeah! we've done so much amatuer stuff together. I helped him get his start with Riot.
[1:40:08] grimrevolution: It's too small you must make it bigger
[1:40:29] grimrevolution: Nice! That's really cool!
[1:40:43] KptBoredom: @jarvitz world needs more lapras. make a bigger lapras
[1:40:44] jarvitz: twitch has a size limit of 28x28
[1:41:02] jarvitz: and I don't have 4 emote slots
[1:41:04] grimrevolution: That's rude
[1:41:11] grimrevolution: tell them to stop that
[1:41:18] jarvitz: :(
[1:41:20] kushplaukis: who win
[1:41:21] KptBoredom: ah damn that was my next suggestion
[1:41:27] KptBoredom: 4 slot lapras emote
[1:41:43] grimrevolution: 22 slot lapras emote
[1:41:50] CDMLoL: frosk on fire with the kt memes
[1:41:53] KptBoredom: oh god yes give me that emote
[1:42:04] grimrevolution: BIGGER IS BETTER
[1:42:07] CasterFroskurinn: I'm in dual screen just destorying careers over here on the shitposting
[1:42:11] grimrevolution: ENLARGE THE LAPRAS
[1:42:13] jarvitz: ask nightblue he has enough slots Kappa

[1:44:07] CDMLoL: keep the shitposting up
[1:44:18] KptBoredom: Soon™ another 50 minute game INC
[1:44:18] jarvitz: I want rusty
[1:44:57] KptBoredom: 3:30 AM... sleep or more LPL 🤔
[1:45:31] jarvitz: @casterfroskurinn you guys need 1 more PBP person then you can have each color with each PBP exactly once per week all season
[1:46:22] grimrevolution: More lpl how is that even a question?
[1:46:32] grimrevolution: LPL > Sleep
[1:46:53] KptBoredom: shit dude you're right
[1:47:10] KptBoredom: thank god i don't work
[1:48:00] grimrevolution: thank god is right
[1:48:07] grimrevolution: how could you consider anything else?
[1:48:17] grimrevolution: Shame on you
[1:48:51] yuchiwai: there arent any big match today
[1:49:43] grimrevolution: PRAYER CIRCLE FOR A LESS THAN 50 MINUTE GAME
[1:50:24] MercuryCasts: skt won so im watching this
[1:50:53] grimrevolution: they won so rip
[1:50:56] MercuryCasts: i hope they dont
[1:51:07] 甜野的小迷妹: they just did
[1:51:22] MercuryCasts: they do now
[1:51:29] MercuryCasts: since they won to KT
[1:51:41] MercuryCasts: i just hope they dont win worlds
[1:51:42] grimrevolution: yeah lol they just beat KT they're going to playoffs at least
[1:51:49] grimrevolution: same
[1:52:54] KptBoredom: 4th set of SKT skins incoming
[1:53:08] MercuryCasts: i hope someone else wins
[1:53:17] MercuryCasts: skt have already won 3 times
[1:53:22] KptBoredom: sneakyFedora
[1:53:23] MercuryCasts: let another team win
[1:53:34] grimrevolution: why do we always talk about the lck in this chat can't we talk about something else for once like how to bully twitch into giving @jarvitz more slot to make a 22 slot Lapras
[1:53:53] Warwizard23: a team built to take SKT down and they havent even once. Thats sad FailFish FailFish FailFish
[1:54:32] MercuryCasts: faker isnt even doing well
[1:55:39] lassesays: >more efficient lv 3 vs lv 5 ?
[1:56:07] BunnyChallenger: the same teams like last game ? wtf
[1:57:13] MercuryCasts: i really hope a western team wins
[1:57:20] MercuryCasts: maybe fnatic or tsm
[1:57:32] MercuryCasts: just not an asian team for once
[1:57:35] KptBoredom: sneakyHey
[1:57:47] grimrevolution: I for one am for anyone that's not SKT
[1:58:04] jarvitz: did you see right rivals. EU isn't winning shit
[1:58:20] KptBoredom: i've got the unrealistic hope of seeing cloud 9 win it all but i'll take anyone at this point
[1:58:38] KuosaY: WutFace
[1:58:43] grimrevolution: a c9 win would be cool but, yeah, unrealistic
[1:58:56] trisssmerigold: franchising will allow chinese teams to experiment and really bring out the hidden talents in the vast chinese player base
[1:59:06] KuosaY: WutFace WutFace
[1:59:07] trisssmerigold: or even the talents in coaches
[1:59:11] KuosaY: WutFace WutFace WutFace
[1:59:19] MercuryCasts: the only world championship an asian team hasnt won was the one before they didnt even have a region
[1:59:34] KuosaY: who won skt kt
[1:59:42] grimrevolution: skt
[1:59:43] MercuryCasts: skt 2-1
[1:59:44] Fullmetalpwn: Skt
[1:59:49] trisssmerigold: SKT is good at counter picking an early advantage comb. and win early game force other team to make desperate plays and make mistakes
[1:59:54] KuosaY: ty WutFace
[2:00:11] trisssmerigold: with a great coach good at that and players of big champ pool, it had wored wonders so far,
[2:00:39] trisssmerigold: but thats just the only strength tho, and can be beaten easily with better talents know what theyre doing.
[2:00:55] Warwizard23: cmonBruh
[2:00:56] chrysopelea: "easily"
[2:01:01] MercuryCasts: mata morgana was horrible
[2:01:09] trisssmerigold: you see Faker successful escapes, thats not becasue how good faker is but that the other team is doing desperate plays and desperate plays usually lead to big failure
[2:01:10] Fullmetalpwn: KT with a big pick/ban fail by leaving Zac open thinking Peanut doesn't play it, and insted first picked Kalista for Deft
[2:01:29] trisssmerigold: on the ohter hand, faker is bad that allows these opportunities for the enemy team
[2:01:36] trisssmerigold: at positioning
[2:01:36] Baldier3: wait a minute, why is the quality of the stream so good today?
[2:01:55] grimrevolution: because they updated to 1080
[2:02:01] grimrevolution: it's been like that for a while
[2:02:02] trisssmerigold: Faker is realy over hyped, his strength is nothing but a big champ pool and a really good coach and team mates
[2:02:13] grimrevolution: and MrDestructoid hasn't paid a visit just yet
[2:02:22] MercuryCasts: he is really bad rn
[2:03:02] mujarshad: like who?
[2:03:38] mujarshad: @Dylanklebold91181 almost Jebaited me but not today 4Head
[2:03:40] trisssmerigold: but kona's counter picking really force other teams into losing side and doing desperate plays that allows SKT's relatively good players to punish them
[2:04:03] trisssmerigold: wiht a passive aggresive macro
[2:04:24] mujarshad: ????
[2:04:33] mujarshad: nice joke :)
[2:04:47] Shyvakuma: lul
[2:05:40] trisssmerigold: which is also why SKT is strongest at BO5 cause thats where the coach and pick ban ability really comes to shine compared to bo1s
[2:06:03] trisssmerigold: combined with their huge champ pool
[2:06:05] Shyvakuma: But yeah, feels like SKT not doing relatively well this split. their plays are not as amazing/convincing as before.
[2:06:07] chrysopelea: they've won 3 world championships 2 MSI's idk man
[2:06:20] Bdox: jin jow
[2:06:36] mujarshad: yeah literally no one says that skt is the best league org in the world
[2:06:41] trisssmerigold: on the other hand Faker really made a good choice somehow stayed in SKT where kona's p/b really utilized his champ pool to the max
[2:06:41] mujarshad: nope, no one says that
[2:07:21] mujarshad: DansGame ING WTF
[2:07:21] grimrevolution: RIP Dan gaming
[2:07:23] chrysopelea: China imported korean talent yet still lose
[2:07:54] trisssmerigold: exactly cause p/b really wins games
[2:08:11] trisssmerigold: and team strategy
[2:08:17] trisssmerigold: rather than player raw strength
[2:08:19] KhazixTooStronk: lpl but everyone talks about skt LUL
[2:08:32] grimrevolution: yeah it's exhausting
[2:08:45] grimrevolution: they can't do it in the lck chat cause it's full of memes
[2:08:52] mujarshad: i won't, lck is actually going on right now
[2:08:56] grimrevolution: so they come here
[2:08:57] mujarshad: eu/na aren't
[2:09:09] mujarshad: go talk in lck chat
[2:09:16] Fullmetalpwn: poor LPL, just 840 of us watching compared to 70kish across both main channels :(
[2:09:41] mujarshad: niether is likely
[2:09:46] grimrevolution: which is NICE I like the small viewership, the chat isn't obnoxious until the LCK people come over here
[2:10:08] Fullmetalpwn: @Dylanklebold91181 ohhh? how many views do they have rn?
[2:10:32] mujarshad: lpl streams get like hundreds of thousands of viewers
[2:10:33] grand_sizulate: lck person here 4Head
[2:10:44] grimrevolution: on pandatv? lol a lot
[2:10:51] mujarshad: the chinese ones
[2:10:59] grimrevolution: the LPL is the most watched region in the world due to pandatv
[2:11:11] jarvitz: frosk help I'm tired but lpl
[2:11:14] Fullmetalpwn: saya wha!?
[2:11:29] grimrevolution: frosk left to go get ready to cast the next set
[2:11:42] chrysopelea: LUL
[2:11:44] jarvitz: @grimrevolution you help then
[2:11:46] zKRYST4L: did the stream freeze?
[2:11:53] BunnyChallenger: y
[2:11:57] mujarshad: no
[2:12:03] grimrevolution: WAKE UP LAPRAS NEEDS YOU
[2:12:08] jarvitz: jarvitHi
[2:12:22] mujarshad: wow
[2:12:29] Warwizard23: Jebaited
[2:12:35] mujarshad: the pandatv stream has 2.7m viewers right now wtf
[2:12:41] Voysees: only 800 because of telecom war
[2:12:57] Fullmetalpwn: 2.7k million watching right now on panda tv... my mind is blown holy shit
[2:13:03] mujarshad: LOOOOOOOl
[2:13:07] jarvitz: uhh no
[2:13:19] grimrevolution: lol it's so funny watching people find Pandatv and then realize how huge the lpl really is
[2:13:20] jarvitz: 2.7k million is 2.7 billion
[2:13:31] MorriganLugus: BigBrother RUN IT DOWN
[2:13:31] grimrevolution: a lot of english speakers watch it on there too
[2:13:53] mujarshad: i think even lspl streams are more popular lol
[2:13:55] Fullmetalpwn: @Dylanklebold91181 true, I had no idea
[2:13:57] chrysopelea: yeah cause china has 2 billion people
[2:14:05] chrysopelea: why are we comparing apples to oranges
[2:14:19] grimrevolution: yeah the lspl has ore viewers than the lck gets in a week
[2:14:41] 甜野的小迷妹: 1.4, or 1.5, definitely not close to 2 billion
[2:14:42] pnkuU: @zoomenhanced you can turn it of
[2:14:44] michaelsund: Because China numba 1 MingLee
[2:14:47] pnkuU: its a toggle
[2:14:47] class_gannon: Apples>oranges
[2:14:49] grimrevolution: and that's in... a day?
[2:14:51] trisssmerigold: @zoomenhanced you can make the fronts smaller or allow them only on half or 1/4 of the screen
[2:14:59] grimrevolution: no, it's all only in chinese
[2:15:03] jarvitz: why is there no English lspl stream. id watch
[2:15:04] Shyvakuma: lol
[2:15:07] chrysopelea: yet apparently out of all those league players they can't find enough chinese to fill their own league and import koreans LUL
[2:15:14] Fullmetalpwn: @neonpinku is it like twitters with LPL #'s or something like that?
[2:15:22] wowan116: And ez 322,coef. 3.7 on - 1.5
[2:15:24] Fullmetalpwn: tweets*
[2:15:29] mujarshad: english lpl barely has viewers why would they do lspl lol
[2:15:41] grimrevolution: there are more chinese players than korean players in the lpl though lol
[2:15:55] chrysopelea: yet why import
[2:15:56] 甜野的小迷妹: @zoomenhanced no we don't enjoy that, I come to twich partly because of all the spams there
[2:16:03] Voysees: any team is only allowed so many imports
[2:16:07] michaelsund: @grimrevolution that makes sense since the import rule exists
[2:16:08] pnkuU: @zoomenhanced oh, yeah. there are people that like it, i guess. but no one i know personally watches with them on.
[2:16:09] 甜野的小迷妹: at least here the chat moves slower
[2:16:10] trisssmerigold: @chrysopelea its becasue the ridiculous amount of money in the scene allows them to do so, and when other teams starts doing it you have to follow up otherwise you might get kicked out, which is why they're franchise to allow teams experimenting with local talents
[2:16:23] jarvitz: @mujarshad well they could just record them and stream them during the day. no one would notice
[2:16:30] grimrevolution: because the lpl has a lot of money so they spend it on the best talents not taking in consideration the language barriers between koreans and chinese players
[2:16:35] pnkuU: @Fullmetalpwn what do you mean?
[2:16:49] absolwave: dank arin PogChamp
[2:16:51] grimrevolution: Like RNG in 2016 had two koreans and three chinese players BUT they all had to speak in english
[2:16:57] 甜野的小迷妹: most top-tier LPL teams have some youth teams though, audi and iboy are EDG
[2:17:01] Fullmetalpwn: the writing that scrolls across the stream, what is it about?
[2:17:01] grimrevolution: So it causes a lot of issues
[2:17:08] zKRYST4L: if the lpl spend it on the best talents how come golden glue isn't on a chinese team
[2:17:14] 甜野的小迷妹: EDG's own talent developed from their youth team
[2:17:20] grimrevolution: Ads, information, things happening after and elsewhere, news
[2:17:25] grimrevolution: lol it's played on tv
[2:17:31] chrysopelea: One of the stupidest thing I learned about the LPL is that they don't teach their korean imports chinese and communicate in pings FailFish
[2:17:34] JokerKV: @zkryst4l because goldenglue sux?
[2:17:35] mujarshad: LPL Kreygasm
[2:17:39] grimrevolution: Think of it as a normal football game

[2:19:10] Voysees: goodnight
[2:19:13] michaelsund: Neither MingLee
[2:19:19] Voysees: im na
[2:19:19] grimrevolution: in this chat right now?
[2:19:21] chrysopelea: @Dylanklebold91181 LUL in a way the chinese league actually makes the LCK stronger since they use that to scout koreans to recruit
[2:19:41] Shyvakuma: oce here
[2:19:53] grimrevolution: most people are either oce or na
[2:20:02] vikki45: im eu
[2:20:03] somous161: DAN is a new team for LPL, they updated from LSPL, After they joined LPL, they beated RNG, EDG, OMG, SS
[2:20:06] Shyvakuma: or eu
[2:20:15] one_more_plz: chinese here MingLee
[2:20:18] michaelsund: NA at this time?
[2:20:25] grimrevolution: you'll get the occasional eu and south americans though
[2:20:25] Voysees: its 7am
[2:20:26] trisssmerigold: @chrysopelea its more about team strategy and coach, rather than raw talent, the ability to communicate and form a coherent team that can execute a strategy is more important in winning in LOL
[2:20:53] 甜野的小迷妹: @somous161 no I don't think they beat RNG, didn't they lose all six matches versing group B?
[2:20:53] trisssmerigold: @chrysopelea so it doesnt even matter, put Faker in any of the bottom tier team of LPL their ranking wont change even a single bit
[2:21:05] grimrevolution: I work nights and I'm NA this is my normal wake time
[2:21:25] michaelsund: Rip Kappa
[2:21:28] Shyvakuma: 20:30 in aus
[2:21:39] Shyvakuma: the time differences
[2:21:47] 甜野的小迷妹: 21:00 in aus Kappa
[2:21:47] SuperHighDude: 13:00 Denmark
[2:21:52] grimrevolution: @甜野的小迷妹 yeah, Dan lost every game against group B
[2:21:56] grimrevolution: RNG dumpstered them
[2:21:57] JayTekkenX: Rusty AngelThump
[2:22:02] trisssmerigold: to be honest, how many of you can recgnize Faker in a game if you cover the team names,
[2:22:10] trisssmerigold: NONE
[2:22:21] grimrevolution: I can
[2:22:28] grimrevolution: the jungler will be camping the fuck outta that lane
[2:22:35] trisssmerigold: if they switch some general challenger into fakers role you wont even notice
[2:22:53] Shyvakuma: tru
[2:23:15] Voysees: though faker does have some lucky plays
[2:23:16] grand_sizulate: random challlenger player = faker 4Head
[2:23:18] 甜野的小迷妹: He used skins in game 1 and 3 today Kappa
[2:23:18] astropuma: That dude looks like Steve Janowski
[2:23:18] grimrevolution: lol SAME
[2:23:38] grimrevolution: I can spot out Rookie too if you covered his name
[2:23:39] trisssmerigold: LOL is in a state that personal player raw strength really doesnt mean sht at the highest level cause counter p/b and team comb out shines it so much
[2:23:47] grimrevolution: Just look for the syndra flash ulting someone
[2:24:10] trisssmerigold: the advantage brought by a better p/b and macro is so much, at least 100x more than any single player raw strength advantage
[2:24:12] Shyvakuma: could be bjerg
[2:24:24] grimrevolution: Rookie flashes walls though
[2:24:29] chrisrox22: play skill does still matter to a point
[2:24:32] grimrevolution: into fog of war
[2:24:40] grimrevolution: for no reason
[2:24:49] grimrevolution: other than to ult someone
[2:25:26] trisssmerigold: only when both team dont know what theyre' doing at p/b without a pre ordinated team comb, could player raw strength stand out
[2:25:31] grimrevolution: I can spot Mata's alistar too, probably
[2:25:33] teemoyang: Where did the hostess go?
[2:26:10] grimrevolution: The thing about the LPL is that a lot of midlaners have their own kind of... quirks?
[2:26:11] Voysees: thats true sometimes you can figure out the player because they have uniqe builds
[2:26:23] somous161: laoge shuo yingyu hao lei a
[2:26:23] chrisrox22: drafting seems vital to winning/losing
[2:26:27] grimrevolution: Like Rookie with flash and ult someone with no fucks given
[2:26:37] 87Eli: I like the TriHard caster
