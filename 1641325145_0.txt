[0:08:13] Husseingaming22: ??
[0:08:17] RANGERZX: he must lose like
[0:08:20] RANGERZX: 27
[0:08:31] 2sadsatan2: you need 64.5% winrate just not to lose LP
[0:08:42] chross1999: xdd
[0:08:54] InvisibleShadows: hurs af
[0:08:54] xdraga: climbable just dont lose Kappa
[0:08:57] InvisibleShadows: hurts*
[0:08:58] megagngn: but if it is not like this we eventually have 3000lp at rank 1 no?
[0:09:01] sato_ad: agurin just doesnt care keeps winning lmao
[0:09:10] RANGERZX: im 723lp with a 71% winrate and im +17 and -16
[0:09:11] RANGERZX: i dont understand
[0:09:17] anxietyandstresss: https://twitter.com/LEC_Wooloo/status/1587781939133648897
[0:09:18] RANGERZX: like the more i win the less i gain
[0:09:20] caronte_v2: i mean how can u get the rank 1 when he is above 200 lp and u get +5
[0:09:21] caronte_v2: KEKW
[0:09:40] elnvee: just better matchmaking needed no? i think low lp gains come from unbalanced match makijg ( 1 chall and 4 gm )
[0:09:45] rgbkarl: @RANGERZX you lost mmr flip
[0:09:47] goodguystof: hello guys
[0:09:47] Toqueith: ez 50 game winstreak angle
[0:09:57] Geeving: @anxietyandstresss lol what
[0:10:25] dol0ur: HELO JACKSPEKTRA
[0:10:32] rgbkarl: @RANGERZX who knows what complex algorith is behinde the mmr calculation which riot created
[0:10:51] dol0ur: I LOVE GETTING +22  OND ECAY
[0:10:57] dol0ur: IN 600LP ALREADY
[0:10:57] RANGERZX: its lame because people trying to get challenger right now are struggling because of shit gains
[0:11:02] RANGERZX: and at the top of the ladder the best strat is to just
[0:11:04] RANGERZX: simply NOT play
[0:11:27] N7ShepardLoL: The problem is that euw lp is very inflated, the system try‚Äôs to push higher people down, but because it‚Äôs so inflated the gains and loses are warped, idk how it got to this point tho
[0:11:28] rgbkarl: makes sense
[0:11:35] MiamiMarty: Agurin will sit up there until end and is now a mid main
[0:11:48] Aleixo0: they changed it
[0:12:01] sato_ad: zyb is coming tho
[0:12:04] Geeving: Riot too busy changing item icons Kappa
[0:12:05] dol0ur: they need toi make it so everyone has to go play more decays
[0:12:08] dol0ur: now
[0:12:12] dol0ur: otherwise its fked
[0:12:24] RANDYHUNTER123: doesnt he have to play decay games anymore
[0:12:25] dol0ur: even vs 1200-1300lp i only get +20 as 600
[0:12:31] megagngn: is mmr was shown the guy with +5 lp has the highest mmr probably. because there is no one higher than him
[0:12:56] megagngn: no in mmr not in lp

[0:13:52] dol0ur: ye its not rn but when magifelix did it with 8 acc chall
[0:13:54] dol0ur: it was real tho
[0:13:55] Geeving: this is obviously all Carlos his fault
[0:14:00] dol0ur: 8 accs only playing decay
[0:14:00] RANGERZX: riot should be more transparent about their systems .
[0:14:03] Toqueith: if bo or magifelix is the reason the system breaks , the system just sucks dick to begin with

[0:55:23] Rango235: thoughts on your new support :tf:
[0:55:43] yan__i: @lymet nah overall I am a chill and not toxic person, like I don't even mind if the support goes 0/10, but it feel kind of unplayable for me
[0:55:47] potfriend166: fold is goofy
[0:55:49] yan__i: it is just a statistic from my last 20 games
[0:55:50] James_InJapan: The s22 ultra is the new "note"
[0:55:58] lymet: @yan__i low sample
[0:56:01] James_InJapan: it's nice. I enjoy it so far
[0:56:29] Swearfy: ngl "new" inovative thing that i wish for is to bring the jack back
[0:56:34] baronpoint: varus ?
[0:56:44] yan__i: @lymet it doesn't matter I can give a 50 games sample, the point stays
[0:56:52] James_InJapan: umm I wouldn't say it's big. it's like sligly bigger than the 14 max I think
[0:57:18] lymet: @yan__i okay so you have bad support every game, just focus on things you can change cs, positioning etc
[0:57:20] potfriend166: janna outplay!!!

[0:58:55] lymet: @yan__i if you play 1000 games there is no way its always your support or teams fault, thats just cope

[0:59:29] Allsido: even an old 24 years old man ?

[0:59:52] DefonasTFT: Idk i dropped 400lp its hard to keep good mindset
[0:59:53] yan__i: @lymet my point was, is it better to duoq
[0:59:57] lymet: @yan__i see thats the good mind set
[1:00:02] datio123: not worth the time, waste of time if you dont make money with it
