[1:46:48] Just_Tyto: Dyrus r u okay are you having a stroke
[1:46:50] WhoFedFioraEve: Dyrus duo with me we get gm together
[1:46:50] Aco121: @Gunnarson yes for us who know his songs,but in general it
[1:46:51] adeewun: mastiff lmao
[1:46:51] RadiantSoul_Tv: it doesnt remove attack speed ebuff tho
[1:46:53] 1MrMe: dyrusFish dyrusFish
[1:46:53] kinaria_a: brain lag
[1:46:58] RadiantSoul_Tv: debuff*
[1:46:59] Taw______: @Aco121 mf just called what's prob 2pacs biggest hit "underrated" KEKW
[1:47:04] CallMeRavioli: do you smell toast
[1:47:04] maybbeth: we're all aware league is mentally draining
[1:47:06] Oriyanya: @WhoFedFioraEve bro u cant duo in masters
[1:47:06] ToddTheWiz: question for anyone, why wouldn't you pick merc over swifties?
[1:47:07] Aco121: @Gunnarson it's underrated songs
[1:47:34] WhoFedFioraEve: @WhoFedFioraEve ik it was a joke me and him can duo to masters tho
[1:47:44] Gunnarson: @Aco121 youre acting like not everyone knows who tupac is LuL not like he was one of the biggest and best rappers out there
[1:47:50] zachimon: it's sad how nobody appreciate's biggie's forgotten gem "hypnotize" Sadge
[1:47:57] NullAngel: Swifties reduce the wither slow, mercs reduce the wither duration, and tabis reduce q damage. Depends on your champ which one you want, tbh.
[1:47:58] Just_Tyto: @ToddTheWiz against Nasus specifically, or ever?
[1:48:08] Taw______: @Aco121 no  PeepoFinger
[1:48:09] Gunnarson: whos biggie
[1:48:20] ToddTheWiz: in general
[1:48:30] zachimon: @Gunnarson nobody knows Sadge so underrated
[1:48:38] Just_Tyto: They give you higher base movespeed
[1:48:49] Gunnarson: fr never heard that name, is he a tv show host?
[1:48:49] Oriyanya: @Gunnarson bro everyone knows who biggie is
[1:48:57] ofay07: so who out scales in this matchup? lol
[1:48:58] JohnMFnWick: @Gunnarson favorite deal at Wendys
[1:48:58] maybbeth: @Gunnarson enough to feed the needy
[1:49:11] Aco121: @Gunnarson  here in balkan , few of them hear about his real big songs like these
[1:49:15] JohnMFnWick: Kapp
[1:49:20] ToddTheWiz: ah, that's the only reason?
[1:49:30] ToddTheWiz: i still think mercs are pretty op
[1:49:30] Rosmic: @ofay07 depends on how many Q stacks nasus gets
[1:49:39] snarfiedoo: Pog
[1:49:41] dosiris25: nice w
[1:49:47] Hazeo: honor lux
[1:49:50] Brackker: clutch
[1:49:54] Just_Tyto: Mercs are better for most champs a lot of the time
[1:49:54] Gunnarson: @JohnMFnWick BIG fan of the 5$ biggie bag
[1:50:02] ofay07: @rosmic ahhh that makes sense
[1:50:05] Just_Tyto: but there are a good number of champs that movespeed is better on
[1:50:09] Gunnarson: @Oriyanya no clue, I only know drake and logic
[1:50:20] JohnMFnWick: @Gunnarson peepoFat hell yea
[1:50:34] nuwbZ: plate gold NotLikeThis
[1:50:34] Just_Tyto: remember that percent movespeed increases multiply your base movespeed which INCLUDES the value provided by boots
[1:50:37] zachimon: would you ever sell refill and wait for 10 gold instead?
[1:50:43] sp0rt1n: swifties POGGIES
[1:50:46] Taw______: @Aco121 you're just not interacting with the right people then, that aint an issue about the balkans
[1:50:51] joshuakyle94: @Dyrus so do swifties or is it mercs that break his wither faster?
[1:51:01] ToddTheWiz: oh, so it would be good on like a hecarim
[1:51:07] JohnMFnWick: @TytoCorvus the numbers Mason, what do they mean NotLikeMiya
[1:51:09] Aco121: @Gunnarson just go on yt and see how mmuch views he have on these songs,so i think most of people don't know very well
[1:51:14] Gunnarson: @Cracked_NA mercs make it go away faster, swifties make the slow not as bad
[1:51:43] Just_Tyto: @ToddTheWiz yes, though like everything in this game it's context dependent
[1:51:44] zachimon: swifites are also good if you're living in poverty
[1:51:46] NullAngel: -12
[1:51:48] joshuakyle94: @Gunnarson thanks, never actaully knew after playing for 8 years llol
[1:52:07] LsxNapier420: fast af
[1:52:33] Just_Tyto: if you can already keep on someone, then they don't make much difference. if 20 movespeed is the difference between catching someone and not then it's huge.
[1:52:40] Gunnarson: @Cracked_NA yeah tenacity makes the effects of CC (not knockups) not last as long and swifites say in their description that they make slows not as bad by like 40% or something
