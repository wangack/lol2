[0:07:23] T3Blitz: laning against viktor Despairge
[0:09:38] keeguar: HOLY
[0:10:36] jaydengers: personally don't like first strike at all on viktor. played it so many times and it just gives like 100ish gold by the end of lane
[0:10:49] jaydengers: it scales decently well but aery is for laning
[0:10:57] T3Blitz: If you always make a point to trade when first strike is up
[0:11:01] T3Blitz: i think you get a decent amount of gold from it
[0:11:11] jaydengers: ye i do, ive practiced it a decent amount

[0:22:59] zaytnnn: red kayn into 3 melees
[0:22:59] hydraneet: it feels like kayn and camille are doing some heavy lifting
[0:23:14] hydraneet: doesn't trist needs like 4 items to be online?
[0:23:24] timolasso: Voli needs to go bot and hardshove after this drag

[0:24:54] timolasso: voli is a shit champ
[0:25:01] jaydengers: voli doesnt lose to camille in lane
[0:25:02] PrunJuice: oh nice, you're 6/1 syndra. should be able to snowball easy.
[0:25:09] zaytnnn: voli beats camille

[0:27:19] MeFrank: camille escaped with like .1% from ult execute xdd
[0:27:21] hydraneet: i guess camille is just way to go of a pick into your team comp
[0:27:45] timolasso: voli should just int push botlane
