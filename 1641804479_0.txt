[2:33:15] mutantnemo: I'm still in the ironic phase. But I'm doing my best to catch-up.

[2:34:30] MaverickMan909: sayin kappa in the real world
[2:34:36] MaverickMan909: or pogchamp
[2:34:57] RMX_DZOK: i refuse to believe that some1 is saying kappa irl
[2:35:18] KaitoGen: bro the zoomers turned kapp into their own thing and spell it "cap"

[2:41:33] RMX_DZOK: can someone explain me how the tanks hav so much dmg? that vi character is always top2 dmg dealer in my lobbies
[2:42:05] KaitoGen: cuz there's only 1 tank a team, if they have no damage they can't create space as efficiently
[2:42:10] KaitoGen: so you can just ignore them and go dive comps all day

[2:45:50] RMX_DZOK: in rankeds you can ban champions?
[2:46:02] KaitoGen: no
[2:46:26] mutantnemo: I feel they don't have enough heroes to make banning viable yet.
[2:46:31] KaitoGen: it's definitely one of those games where you can climb with about anything but you gotta put in mad work if you don't play the hyper meta
[2:46:54] RMX_DZOK: so what's the hyper meta now? adc role
[2:47:13] KaitoGen: I think 1 ban per role would be kinda ok but it'd just be perma banning zarya, sojourn, kiriko/lucio. But I guess that's how bans work lol
[2:47:30] KaitoGen: ban the op then next patch ban the new op
[2:47:33] epik323: hello i was in the last game, we were 5 in discord practicing for our school tournament

[3:10:47] RMX_DZOK: i don't play TFT in general, i just play to get the skin. Literally every game i go lagoon kaisa zac and then dragons and in 99% i climb lp.
[3:10:49] fatguy925: YES, complexity, and Depth

[3:16:17] RMX_DZOK: @fatguy925 bounty is the best thing they added
[3:16:21] fatguy925: There was a time when it was a complaint, where gold to challenger was a very much different game than LCS, but LCS was where the stats were being harvested.
[3:16:25] prophaniti86: can confirm, am silver and only play scaling champs because all games go to 50 min
[3:16:43] fatguy925: smiteHmm
