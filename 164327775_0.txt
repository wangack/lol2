[1:51:55] Krincy: @iSeverity I don't think so. Spirit was inconsistent and Mowgli hit rank1 KR soloq, Spirit wouldn't just win those games
[1:52:08] DoogieMacGyver: @Kyle__twitch did you hear me talk about the enemy at all? "should have more wins" is BS, you need to play good, losing to yourself means you can get gudder easier but you still deserved your losses.
[1:52:36] velocegravity: RNG #01
[1:52:41] polduran: IEM is a special kind of tournament. there are not even the "strongest" teams playing.
[1:52:52] Never_Mist: @Krincy yes but subbing veteran spirit out for some one else isnt gonna do well on his confidence
[1:53:04] AzerFraze: minute 40 triforce juneThinking

[1:53:55] DoogieMacGyver: sure? you said 'deserved 4 more wins" or whatever, which isn't true, you threw more than your opponent, you deserve the loss.
[1:54:03] Levigeddon: LUL

[2:39:50] SkyTrax1989: it was like season 3 right when brand was used as top laner from time to time right?

[2:40:21] VizeReZ: If Brand could do something other than just team fight he would be great. if the enemy picks a Brand you just splitpush and 1-3-1 comp him to death.
[2:40:27] NA_Jayce: Gross Bran
[2:40:38] yudai95: brand has the best lane clearing

[2:42:51] OfficialUknoww: Nb got paid to throw I'm convinced

[2:43:13] michaelsund: How did they not spot Doinb FailFish MingLee
[2:43:14] VizeReZ: NB just has to much scaling.

[3:16:16] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: world finals will be an LPL team vs LPL team or against TSM.
[3:16:34] 2丨2: TSM Kappa
[3:16:37] aslanxdefg: TSM IN FINALS OMEGALUL
[3:16:42] Never_Mist: KT and SSG > any LPL team

[3:17:00] keebao: Rift Rivals tho PogChamp LPL > LCK
[3:17:15] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: LCK fans actually believe their top teams can beat TSM LUL
[3:17:22] michaelsund: MingLee
[3:17:29] aslanxdefg: EDG is really good atm
[3:17:30] yudai95: @jasonparanoia o na best of 1 ......
[3:17:30] VizeReZ: that Rift Rivals format was kinda a joke
[3:17:31] 삼도천심해어: TSM PogChamp Kappa
[3:17:32] Never_Mist: @VizeReZ if they get a wall with rumble ult then thats how they win there teamfight
[3:17:34] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: TheThing
[3:17:42] yudai95: u cant come to conclusions based o na best of 1 series ....
[3:17:44] Never_Mist: FailFish
[3:18:02] hundr3dsna: I hope dig wins through gauntlet
[3:18:08] Never_Mist: @VizeReZ i mean if rumble is relevant later lol
[3:18:23] VizeReZ: How will rumble not be relevant later?
[3:18:25] hozzayy: RIFT RIVALS LOL
[3:18:34] chrysopelea: dig gonna lose to the wildcard regions if they make it to worlds LUL
[3:18:40] VizeReZ: how can he not be while bruning the entire enemy team with all of his magic pen
[3:18:48] yudai95: NA is hyoed eveyr year for worlds
[3:18:55] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: yh sure LCK vs LPL rift rivals didnt count but NA vs EU did count right? LUL lmao
[3:18:55] yudai95: and same thing happens every eyar
[3:19:02] Never_Mist: @VizeReZ if he pushes up like that without vision and dies again he wont be
[3:19:03] VizeReZ: I dont want to try and predict who goes to world for NA. top 5 are way too close.
[3:19:05] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: LUL yh sure LCK vs LPL rift rivals didnt count but NA vs EU did count right? LUL lmao
[3:19:10] 삼도천심해어: LCK LUL
[3:19:11] OfficialUknoww: Tsm won't beat clg this Sunday
[3:19:36] VizeReZ: Rumbles build is cheap. he will get there. and even if he is behind that equilizer damage is still massive.
[3:19:44] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: TSM will 2-0 CLG
[3:19:47] yudai95: but clg lost to P1 and TSM beat P1, thus by simple logic CLG < TSM
[3:19:53] 2丨2: LUL
[3:19:54] yudai95: Kappa
[3:20:06] 1loveblond: SeemsGood
[3:20:06] CodingWithAndrej: LUL
[3:20:10] Never_Mist: @VizeReZ lol he almost got killed again xD
[3:20:16] noodle_soupi: clg needs more time to synergies the new jungler
[3:20:17] VizeReZ: NA vs EU Rift Rivals didnt have a Bo1 series to finish out
[3:20:30] OfficialUknoww: Phoenix 1 going to worlds lul
[3:20:39] RukShukWarrior: so who is chat betting on between JDG and NB

[3:20:41] yudai95: i like P1
[3:20:44] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: UOL lost to roccat and almost lost to MM LUL
[3:20:47] VizeReZ: that is fine. that is rumble
[3:20:47] yudai95: i feel like P1 has reallly biig potential
[3:20:51] Never_Mist: JDG btw
[3:20:52] Nesbyy: na winning a burger king fanbase held tournament and thinking they are good 4Head meanwhile they are 2nd seed for worlds
[3:20:55] yudai95: but theres something wrogn with their communication
[3:20:57] OfficialUknoww: Nb
[3:20:59] keebao: @VizeReZ its weird to compare NA/EU RR to LPL/LCK/LMS because of # of teams :l
[3:21:01] yudai95: synergy problem
[3:21:01] Mahades: Has kalista not biound Thresh?
[3:21:10] Mahades: Still has the item
[3:21:15] chrysopelea: correct me if i wrong but p1 can't make it to worlds right
[3:21:20] VizeReZ: I wouldnt compare them besides the format.
[3:21:24] Never_Mist: nope
[3:21:29] OfficialUknoww: I'm trolling
[3:21:30] VizeReZ: P1 is locked in relegation
[3:21:38] VizeReZ: cant gauntlet.
[3:21:41] Tycho78: bug maybe?
[3:21:46] chrysopelea: even flyquest right
[3:21:50] Mahades: maybe
[3:21:52] ChodeHammer: who is top in LPL right now?
[3:21:53] yudai95: fnatic is gonna win worlds anyways 3-0 vs kt
[3:21:53] Never_Mist: JDG got this game aslong as they dont throw early
[3:22:02] keebao: they ahve the link between them
[3:22:03] VizeReZ: Flyquest can be in the gauntlet still
[3:22:05] michaelsund: fnc MingLee MingLee MingLee
[3:22:09] keebao: probably a bug
[3:22:17] yudai95: fnatic is currently the best team i nthe west
[3:22:19] Never_Mist: @ChodeHammer OMG EDG
[3:22:19] RukShukWarrior: they have the tank line to just run the NB team down
[3:22:30] chrysopelea: oh yeah they can still reach 8th LUL
[3:22:39] Warwizard23: PogChamp
[3:22:43] michaelsund: Fnc wasted 6 months playing kennen comps..
[3:22:51] punkgirl01: LUL
[3:22:51] FoilsArt_: ???
[3:22:51] IceAxer: PulseChamp
[3:22:53] Tycho78: Jebaited
[3:22:55] noodle_soupi: TL to relegations again
[3:23:00] kiiro123: swift lul
[3:23:09] Never_Mist: @VizeReZ welp rumble is gonna be useless now
[3:23:18] ChodeHammer: @iSeverity ty
[3:23:19] ReliqTheSeeker: ?????
[3:23:19] VizeReZ: i guess relegation isnt locked. but based on schedule it pretty much is.
[3:23:21] Haldar199x: i think there is no relegations in NA lcs now
[3:23:27] yudai95: Fnatic is currently the best team in the west, closely followed by G2
[3:23:29] VizeReZ: Rumble is fine being behind.
[3:23:30] Warwizard23: GO JDG!!! SwiftRage
[3:23:42] ChodeHammer: @koti_1488 tempt?
[3:23:44] noodle_soupi: 2017 relegations 2018 no relegations (franchise)
[3:23:46] VizeReZ: @Haldar199x they are still doing it. but it means almost nothing besides out of worlds possibilities.
[3:23:46] Never_Mist: we will see
[3:23:59] chrysopelea: there is still a "relegation" tourny though. Losers have to a pay extra 3 mil if they want to stay in the LCS
[3:24:02] IceAxer: HUNI LUL
[3:24:05] VizeReZ: wait till team fights.
[3:24:06] hozzayy: You guys see Huni on Cho yesterday?
[3:24:08] noodle_soupi: this is last splist with relegations in NA
[3:24:15] melillensede: HUNI LUL
[3:24:18] hozzayy: The instant kill onTaliyah? Lmfao
[3:24:24] expired_milk_reformed: Huni is a joke 4Head
[3:24:26] ace3833: man what a shetty cast
[3:24:26] Riztic: LUL HUNI
[3:24:28] FishRoeSoup: @Hozzayy where did taliyah go to? LUL
[3:24:36] ace3833: Calls dyrus a huni
[3:24:39] hozzayy: Cho so fucking broken
[3:24:47] VizeReZ: @koti_1488 no it is true.
[3:25:09] Nesbyy: Not having relegations is stupid
[3:25:09] chrysopelea: @koti_1488 thats why I put "relegation" in quotes there is still a tourney
[3:25:14] TrinslagTV: @koti_1488 It will cost owners who have teams currently in the LCS 10m which is low
[3:25:29] michaelsund: @zoomenhanced ah yes the series vs skt where he popped off on ahri and inted on Tf Kappa
[3:25:41] TrinslagTV: If the team isn't currently in the LCS it will be 13m, if your team can't buy in and is in the LCS you get 3m as compensation
[3:25:48] VizeReZ: they also dont have to pay the whole 10 mil up front. only 5 mil down payment.
[3:25:48] chrysopelea: teams who lose the relegation have to pay 3 mil more plus the 10 mil for LCS
[3:25:55] IceAxer: DomLUL
[3:26:03] Never_Mist: why didnt they just take the drag and leave FailFish
[3:26:08] FishRoeSoup: Braum: Flash - Ready
[3:26:09] IceAxer: Walk through walls PulseChamp
[3:26:19] 삼도천심해어: KKona
[3:26:25] VizeReZ: @koti_1488 and yes i did read it. did you? or did you just read the reddit thread?
[3:26:25] RukShukWarrior: PogChamp
[3:26:32] IceAxer: KKona YES
[3:26:38] Tycho78: haHAA
[3:26:52] ace3833: I wonder if casters know that they are bad...
[3:26:57] ace3833: and try to fix it...
[3:26:57] FoilsArt_: Wall surfing
[3:27:01] IceAxer: 🤘 KKona 🎸 HIGHWAY TO HELL
[3:27:01] TrinslagTV: Franchising won't make it more interesting, it just adds new options for sponsors and owners
[3:27:03] Klucky99: will newbee win?
[3:27:17] aslanxdefg: lpl and lck casters are way better than any lcs caster imo
[3:27:20] DrHonker: drhonkS drhonkS drhonkS
[3:27:23] VizeReZ: They constantly talk about working on their craft. Frosk talks about how much work she put in to change @ace3833
[3:27:29] SkyTrax1989: i think JDG takes this home
[3:27:32] 그렘린1201: TL buying players left and right they first pick up reignover then picks up inori now dardoch TL is fcked 4Head
[3:27:35] elcab0ng: TriHard
[3:27:46] ChodeHammer: TL gonna be the New York Jets of LCS
[3:27:48] VizeReZ: NB wins late unless JDG has too much.
[3:27:53] OfficialUknoww: How much money these pro teams have lol
[3:27:54] michaelsund: Hopefully Reignover is set free
[3:28:00] chrysopelea: yeah nothing is inherently exciting about franchising, its what teams do with the extra safety in mind
[3:28:11] chrysopelea: that will be interesting
[3:28:11] shaniquanza: She's not trans
[3:28:23] shaniquanza: Franchising is pretty boring
[3:28:25] TrinslagTV: Each team is worth different amounts, for instance SKT I believe is around 64m USD
[3:28:29] VizeReZ: she hasnt ignored criticism though... she probably ignores obvious trolls like a smart person.
[3:28:32] shaniquanza: Gonna cut off a lot of diversity
[3:28:42] shaniquanza: Yea she ignores trolls
[3:28:48] ChodeHammer: @Shaniquanza franchising wouldnt be boring if they expanded the size of the league
[3:29:07] 삼도천심해어: EU TP LUL
[3:29:14] VizeReZ: they may look into expansion in the future.
[3:29:28] ziomek3223: galio should be nerfed
[3:29:36] VizeReZ: but franchising only allows teams to invest in new blood which i guess could freshen it up for a little fun
[3:29:37] FishRoeSoup: kogmaw should be nerfed LUL
[3:29:40] VizeReZ: Galio has been nerfed.
[3:29:45] ChodeHammer: i feel like franchising will give a better environment for players to improve
[3:29:58] ChodeHammer: rather than worrying about getting paid and having a place to live
[3:30:00] FishRoeSoup: with franchising i wouldnt be suprised if regi sub in tsm and kobe sub in clg again LUL
[3:30:01] shaniquanza: well yes but it also removes the diveristy that relegations bring in
[3:30:06] michaelsund: Bottom teams wont improve tho
[3:30:08] ChodeHammer: because your team is owned by some kid from dubai
[3:30:16] shaniquanza: If it wasn't for relegations teams like LMQ wouldn't have been born
[3:30:22] noodle_soupi: spy, misfits, fnc, g2 applied to NA LCS due franchising
[3:30:29] IceAxer: JINGDONG MingLee
[3:30:29] VizeReZ: They have teams to look for new blood. the teams will stay the same, but the players will change.
[3:30:38] Team_Vertex: Kay No Mana ResidentSleeper
[3:30:45] ChodeHammer: @Shaniquanza LMQ was also a terribly managed organization that did shady things and didnt pay its players
[3:30:47] Team_Vertex: Kayn*
[3:30:55] TrinslagTV: And none of those EU teams will get in while maintaining their identity
[3:30:59] shaniquanza: LMQ succeeded and had little to no issues
[3:31:03] chrysopelea: bottom teams will need to improve though, sponsors and outside ownership isn't gonna just take losing
[3:31:04] VizeReZ: think of it like the NFL. Yeah Brady has been on the Patriots for years, but there are always different players coming in and out
[3:31:05] shaniquanza: They made it to worlds their first season
[3:31:16] Team_Vertex: @Aznnick does EU LCS have franchising or is it the other way around?
[3:31:28] shaniquanza: No one has franchising yet
[3:31:29] VizeReZ: @Team_Vertex EU wont get franchising.
[3:31:34] shaniquanza: I believe
[3:31:43] Team_Vertex: Ty, guys
[3:31:44] noodle_soupi: only NA LCS, EU LCS not popular enough to gain franchising system
[3:31:53] chrysopelea: EULCS fans had a rage and prevented eu franchsing LUL
[3:31:58] VizeReZ: EU culture doesnt support a franchising system.
[3:32:02] chrysopelea: rage fit
[3:32:03] VizeReZ: LPL wants to be @zoomenhanced
[3:32:05] IceAxer: I'm in love with the Coco CmonRaz
[3:32:07] 2丨2: OMG NB thorwing
[3:32:13] ace3833: These casters need to focus more on game casting then trying to make bad jokes...
[3:32:15] ziomek3223: really jdg can win -.-
[3:32:20] shaniquanza: Coco can't carry this team
[3:32:22] chrysopelea: now eu orgs wanna leave eu
[3:32:23] 2丨2: throwing
[3:32:40] VizeReZ: @zoomenhanced in NA yes
[3:32:48] VizeReZ: although it doesnt carry as much weight.
[3:32:50] IceAxer: @chrysopelea Well Riot is trying to kill off EULCS
[3:32:55] shaniquanza: Not reallt
[3:32:56] ace3833: How can they get better when they try to be a shet comedian
[3:32:56] ziomek3223: they cant lose :(
[3:33:00] michaelsund: @chrysopelea well Spy and Msf are NA orgs and G2 has also na teams
[3:33:05] shaniquanza: EU LCS is fine
[3:33:14] noodle_soupi: NA LCS tons of money in sponsors and franchising, EU LCS is no near its match and falling in viewership this is a fact
[3:33:21] chrysopelea: @IceAxer They listened to their EU fans and stopped franchising not their fault
[3:33:22] shaniquanza: Misfits won't succeeded in NA if they go
[3:33:29] elcab0ng: TriHard my drag
[3:33:38] ChodeHammer: @Shaniquanza MM and NiP are dubious organizations at best
[3:33:40] VizeReZ: It will be a different org if they get into NA.
[3:33:42] Tycho78: DansGame
[3:33:47] IceAxer: @chrysopelea They have been trying to kill EULCS for 2 years now with BO2 and Groups
[3:33:54] shaniquanza: They'll have the same roster
[3:34:00] VizeReZ: They maybe keep two players. mix up the staff
[3:34:00] chrysopelea: i think LPL has an expansion tourny though
[3:34:04] sir_meow_: @vizerez they wont
[3:34:05] shaniquanza: And how would that even work would NA rules about imports apply
[3:34:06] michaelsund: They can't have the same roster wtf FailFish
[3:34:07] VizeReZ: they cant, there are still import rules.
[3:34:21] ChodeHammer: @Shaniquanza only one like that in NA is Flyquest which will probably lose its place in the franchising
[3:34:31] VizeReZ: They can only have two non NA players still
[3:34:38] shaniquanza: The question is do import rules Carry on for what teams that want to switch
[3:34:40] ace3833: Noob casters need to take criticism and try to get better
[3:34:56] sir_meow_: @vizerez they would need to get 3 na talents , which is hard to find , riot won't let em , they are just threatening riot
[3:34:56] ziomek3223: WHY RUB
[3:35:00] shaniquanza: If import rules carry on then why would you completely destroy your roster that is doing ok to do mediocre in NA
[3:35:01] VizeReZ: If they move from NA to EU they need at least 3 NA players.
[3:35:01] IceAxer: Riot can always change the rules as they did with Bjergsen etc
[3:35:07] ace3833: Not ignore criticisms as if they are good
[3:35:11] MichaelToost: gg
[3:35:18] MichaelToost: newbots will lose
[3:35:25] kiiro123: what is rumble doing
[3:35:32] VizeReZ: If Misfits gets in then a NA team gets taken out. There are players to pick up. trades will happen in the off season.
[3:35:32] michaelsund: @Shaniquanza for money ofc LUL that's why EU teams want to go to NA
[3:35:32] kiiro123: wtf
[3:35:32] shaniquanza: Getting caught
[3:35:37] IceAxer: Rumble LUL
[3:35:38] noodle_soupi: piglet should be NA resident next split
[3:35:40] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: LUL
[3:35:42] Tycho78: LUL EU ULT LUL
[3:35:45] Nesbyy: LUL
[3:35:47] shaniquanza: They could expand the amount of teams in NA
[3:35:49] darkblade83: thats a terrible Rumble
[3:35:52] ziomek3223: nice pick rumble...
[3:36:01] ChodeHammer: Froskuurin is probably the best caster from LPL tbh
[3:36:06] IceAxer: Trump is gonna deport all the imports LUL
[3:36:14] ChodeHammer: she used to be annoying but she actually took criticism and got better
[3:36:21] VizeReZ: Financial security in NA. They can pick up a new roster that may be better @Shaniquanza . cant tell anything until it happens.
[3:36:22] IceAxer: SaltyFrosk FROSK
[3:36:24] ace3833: Yah frosk is the only caster imo
[3:36:25] melillensede: LPL Kappa
[3:36:31] shaniquanza: @tozzi_fan obviously but you won't have any success by completely removing your roster and picking up some challenger kids and keeping your best EU players
[3:36:40] lDEXTORI: STFU PAPA SMITHY
[3:36:48] melillensede: Papa `?
[3:36:55] ace3833: others arent just that unique
[3:36:56] lDEXTORI: indeed
[3:37:00] IceAxer: Coco CS LUL
[3:37:09] ace3833: i can get any bronze players and they can cast the same
[3:37:16] noodle_soupi: eu lcs wil die if FNC and G2 move to NA LCS, it wont happen, but its a message towards riot
[3:37:18] VizeReZ: with the new system a lot of team are going to get shifted up. if a new team comes in then the old team has to go.
[3:37:30] ChodeHammer: i think Pulse got better than when he was in EULCS
[3:37:31] michaelsund: @Shaniquanza who cares about standings when franchising exists
[3:37:56] VizeReZ: @tozzi_fan Riot said if you stay at the bottom long enough they consider kicking you.
[3:38:01] shaniquanza: @vizerez they're perfectly fine succeeding in EU, so let me ask you would you rather have a Third or 4th place team in Europe that you can constantly improve or blow up half of your roster to see how you do in NA
[3:38:09] VizeReZ: says it shows poor managment.
[3:38:21] VizeReZ: Id rather have NA money as a businessman.
[3:38:23] shaniquanza: @tozzi_fan also the higher your standing more sponsors you attract and more players which takes you to worlds
[3:38:27] chrysopelea: The problem with EULCS is that they lost all their iconic teams, where is gambit, sk, eg?
[3:38:29] ace3833: Just dont try to make shet jokes and focus on grtting better at casting imo
[3:38:40] IceAxer: Unless the worst teams get demoted the teams will just create a team of Memers and Famous people that will make them money
[3:38:44] VizeReZ: Gambit is in the Russian league.
[3:38:49] shaniquanza: Gambit is in Russia, SK is focusing on CS, and E.G. Died
[3:38:57] chrysopelea: NA never lost their core orgs and was able to grow their fanbase
[3:38:58] ChodeHammer: i wish Loken had stayed in LCK
[3:39:02] Tycho78: what a throw
[3:39:02] kiiro123: LUL
[3:39:05] SavageMemeMeltWorldDream: D:
[3:39:12] ace3833: And why arr they trying to talk over themselves..
[3:39:15] noodle_soupi: EU LCS players doing pracftically same job as NA LCS, yet the payment is 4-6 times as much, and with new franchise guaranteed salary
[3:39:15] IceAxer: "Fnc not an iconic team" LUL
[3:39:21] ChodeHammer: ESC Ever with Athena Loken and Key was a really good team
[3:39:22] shaniquanza: NA lost dig but they bought themselves back in
[3:39:28] VizeReZ: saying NA never lost core orgs. no one remember GGU BibleThump
[3:39:29] shaniquanza: Ever was a great team
[3:39:36] IceAxer: NA lost Complexity as well
[3:39:38] ace3833: Not funny...
[3:39:41] shaniquanza: But Athena wanted cash and guaranteed success so he left to EDG
[3:39:47] shaniquanza: And we know how that worked put
[3:39:53] ace3833: Why is the caster laughing...
[3:39:53] shaniquanza: Out*
[3:39:54] ChodeHammer: @Shaniquanza do you remember who their top and JG was?
[3:40:00] Tycho78: with their losses in LoL, Dota, and CS, fnatic will be lucky to still be a team at all next year
[3:40:15] VizeReZ: @ace3833 do you watch sports ever?
[3:40:26] IceAxer: @Tycho78 Except that FNC is making more money than ever
[3:40:33] shaniquanza: Bless was top I think or crazy
[3:40:39] chrysopelea: fnatic is owned by big money now, they aren't folding

[3:57:34] ChodeHammer: @d1askonee OG got lucky and got FW in quarters which is the only reason they went to semis
[3:57:36] DrHonker: the whole chat is triggered by like 20 different topics wixLUL
[3:57:38] leon99671: NA Trumped

[3:58:31] IceAxer: NA National debt has increased by 2200% Since 1980 LUL
[3:58:36] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: thats why FW in S5 got 1st place in their group. beat rox and clg very easily SoBayed and OG beat FW DatSheffy
[3:58:41] VizeReZ: FW arent even Korean killers. they are just a good Bo1 team.
[3:58:48] VizeReZ: KR is bad at Bo1
[3:58:58] AlSmash: @dubu_dubu I never claimed that. China is just as stunted as an economic power because of its own economic policy. It's a house of cards that will likely not survive a major economic bump. Too much public money being used to artificially stimulate it.
[3:59:06] ChodeHammer: @d1askonee im saying that OG getting to semis was a 100% fluke and means nothing because they didnt win an actual best of series vs koreans
[3:59:14] VizeReZ: okay not bad. but they a significanly weaker in BO1 combared to Bo3 or Bo5
[3:59:17] OLGoN_RlyTho_cmonBruh: if KR is bad at Bo1 that means they wont get out of groups at worlds LUL
[3:59:19] ChodeHammer: @d1askonee at least G2 did that this year

[4:26:57] DrHonker: teemo usually can win most 1v1's, but the thing is, you should never let teemo 1v1 as a enemy jg. just camp teemo and make him extra useless lol

[4:32:55] remes12: Im stuck in Silver because my team sucks BabyRage

[4:56:34] vinsmokekw: Uzi PogChamp
[4:56:36] nemostreamo: compare uzi to Megan LUL
[4:56:38] Vashnaroth: I hated when they torn Samsung White/Blue apart @Nicontwitch BibleThump
[4:56:44] lokkiiiii: UZi is actually a lot thinner than he first started playing Kappa
[4:56:51] ASkyNightly: Chat fat shaming NotLikeThis
[4:56:59] ZhengleVGC: 4 Megans = 1 Uzi LUL
[4:57:04] TehFluffehCake: uzi Kreygasm
[4:57:06] NicOnTwitch: @Vashnaroth yeah but at least they got big money for that
[4:57:24] fake_zest: what music is this?
[4:57:32] chrysopelea: thats not actually fat, its actually piles of cash that he injected on himself Kappa
[4:57:32] Bandillo64: that song is dope

[4:58:18] DrHonker: all these dodges in lobby ResidentSleeper
[4:58:21] nemostreamo: i was lowkey thinking they could sneak into worlds somehow
[4:58:24] lokkiiiii: No Vasilii No win
[4:58:28] Bandillo64: wow frosks hair is 10/10 today
[4:58:32] NicOnTwitch: who else thinks pulse and frosk actually have crazy chemistry when casting?
[4:58:52] Bandillo64: me VoHiYo
[4:59:01] DrHonker: i think theyu're really good friends off of stream, so i think that helps it fit together on stage
[4:59:44] fanrlanz: GrammarKing
[4:59:47] Vashnaroth: They do, even though I think Pulse still has a lot of room to grow as a caster
[5:00:02] SkyTrax1989: Omg there is a human stuck to that nose
[5:00:11] uqcm: @TwoTragedies LUL
[5:00:22] Bandillo64: ye pulse is growing a bit slow but atleast hes growing

[5:01:39] lokkiiiii: Suzi lol
[5:01:49] NicOnTwitch: why is no one picking maokai?
[5:01:49] Vashnaroth: Vayne into Cait DansGame no please
[5:01:55] ATLien26: Dear God please don't let frosk cast this game BlessRNG
[5:02:00] SSG_Crown: vasili > uzi
[5:02:01] SkyTrax1989: jINX
[5:02:07] SkyTrax1989: aww
[5:02:07] fanrlanz: rip soloq vayne
[5:02:28] Vashnaroth: 'cause Cait is a much higher priority pick @Nicontwitch, she has basically no weak points anymore and her siege is disgustingly OP
[5:03:00] Bandillo64: imo caits late dps has taken a hit
[5:03:02] CidIXlol: kass ban LUL
[5:03:05] Moobot: No links allowed (pawn1224)
[5:03:06] Bandillo64: but shes still so good
[5:03:21] yudai95: is cait as good in late gae team fights as kog maw and tristana?
[5:03:29] nemostreamo: no
[5:03:34] Bandillo64: no dont think so
[5:03:39] nemostreamo: especially not after her nerf
[5:03:41] yudai95: so she does have weakness
[5:03:42] NicOnTwitch: I was just thinking that I miss froskurrin and thooorin videos, feelssadman
[5:03:44] Vashnaroth: She has a different function than Trist/Kog
[5:03:46] SkyTrax1989: Cait is best for siege
[5:03:49] elderikp: when was the nerf?
[5:03:56] Flarvain: loving this bowser theme music
[5:03:57] yudai95: 7.15
[5:04:03] elderikp: they play on 7.14
[5:04:09] Moobot: No links allowed (pawn1224)
[5:04:09] 그렘린1201: damn fury got fatter MingLee
[5:04:19] Vashnaroth: Trist and Kog are scaling hypercarries, Cait has a really potent late game, insane poke potential and trap making sieges deadly
[5:04:52] yudai95: whos better ,kogmaaw or tristana?
[5:04:54] SSG_Crown: MingLee
[5:05:02] f532253947: xiaohu on corki Kreygasm
[5:05:14] fanrlanz: kog banned
[5:05:17] elderikp: i wanna see a pro tarric :)
[5:05:19] yudai95: isnt tristana better than kog maw?
[5:05:27] Bandillo64: i pref tris
[5:05:30] NicOnTwitch: would have liked uzi on vayne
[5:05:35] Bandillo64: shes so much safer
[5:05:37] Vashnaroth: Kog has mixed damage and is better for teamfighting I'd say
[5:05:40] VincentErnie: KappaPride OUTRAGEOUS
[5:05:47] SkyTrax1989: Vayne so weak to cait tho
[5:05:48] Vashnaroth: Trist is safer and better for taking down turrets
[5:05:57] ZhengleVGC: 0% Win Rate on Taric LUL
[5:06:01] fanrlanz: KappaPride
[5:06:04] NicOnTwitch: @TwoTragedies that's very true
[5:06:13] yudai95: what about ashe
[5:06:24] Bandillo64: ashe is a utility adc
[5:06:25] yudai95: does ashe do better in alte game teamfightss than tristana and kog maw?
[5:06:25] Vashnaroth: You take Kog'maw to stomp a teamfight ultra-hard with multi-target autos with on hit damage
[5:06:35] Bandillo64: slow and ulti spam but low dps
[5:06:38] SkyTrax1989: i would have loved to see a Jinx... but think varus will be great
[5:06:39] MichaelToost: RNGay 4Head
[5:06:45] SSG_Crown: @ThunBeast_TheThing LPL fanshit MingLee
[5:06:48] yudai95: is kog maw with statik shiv good?
[5:06:52] Vashnaroth: Ashe brings initiation and kite
[5:06:58] NicOnTwitch: @TwoTragedies jinx is so sadly underplayed imo
[5:07:00] Bandillo64: no ashe is for engages/picks
[5:07:07] Bandillo64: @vashnaroth ye agreed
[5:07:08] SkyTrax1989: Agree
[5:07:18] yudai95: whos harder to play kogmaw or ashe?
[5:07:27] Bandillo64: imo kog
[5:07:27] fanrlanz: lpl just doesnt like ashe lol
[5:07:28] Vashnaroth: Jinx is a poor man's Kog'Maw to be honest
[5:07:31] SkyTrax1989: Kog hans down
[5:07:34] Cujo99: What is with the RNGay stuff?
[5:07:38] danielxpto: whats the thing it chinise people always hiding their faces FailFish
[5:07:46] RustyTheCaster: RNGay is a cn meme
[5:07:47] NicOnTwitch: @Vashnaroth yeah but kog was banned
[5:07:49] Bandillo64: its a cultural thing ^^
[5:07:57] fanrlanz: cuz they say xiaohu is pretty gay
[5:07:58] RustyTheCaster: because Xiaohu is a little bit kappapride to the public eye
[5:07:59] SkyTrax1989: Sivir could have been cool to
[5:08:01] FutureBeyondgt: oh jesus that energy drink is horibble
[5:08:04] ZhengleVGC: RNG = Royal Needs Gay KappaPride
[5:08:17] TehFluffehCake: @RUSTYTheCASTER FeelsBadMan
[5:08:24] Vashnaroth: Did you ever try out those energy drinks @RUSTYTheCASTER
[5:08:26] yudai95: is kogmaw good with static shiv?
[5:08:32] RustyTheCaster: @Vashnaroth which one
[5:08:36] lDEXTORI: WAS KOG BANNED?
[5:08:45] FutureBeyondgt: @Vashnaroth I did
[5:08:45] Bandillo64: i dont like shiv on him
[5:08:52] FutureBeyondgt: they were horrible
[5:09:00] Vashnaroth: The ones they advertise on stream
[5:09:06] lDEXTORI: DID THEY BAN KOG?
[5:09:09] yudai95: why isnt static shiv good on kogmaw?
[5:09:12] FutureBeyondgt: it's like fizzy monster but with a weird twist
[5:09:13] Bandillo64: yes kog was banned
[5:09:15] fanrlanz: how is it comparing to redbull
[5:09:20] Bandillo64: kog doesnt need crits
[5:09:30] Bandillo64: he needs atk speed to procc his w
[5:09:32] Vashnaroth: Statik Shivv is usually built for waveclear or burst damage on single autos
[5:09:32] FutureBeyondgt: kinda tastes like a watered down fizzy red bull
[5:09:37] Vashnaroth: Also for crit
[5:09:52] vinsmokekw: ha ha ha ha
[5:10:03] Bandillo64: there are better items like wits botrk rageblade
[5:10:17] TollyT: Your friend barcodekorean has just started watching! HeyGuys
[5:10:19] 그렘린1201: what a hacker MingLee
[5:10:22] Team_Vertex: Who got first blood?
[5:10:25] 그렘린1201: report MingLee

[5:10:41] fanrlanz: RNG
[5:10:49] Team_Vertex: Thanks!
[5:10:50] Bandillo64: i respect your endurance @pawn1224
[5:10:53] lucasbet: meee
[5:10:54] xcpn: LUL
[5:11:03] Bandillo64: lel
[5:11:03] Vashnaroth: Since Runaan applies on-hit effects to your secondary bolts you tend to stack items with on-hit effects @yudai95
[5:11:13] creepingdeath241: xmissE?
[5:11:16] 그렘린1201: he just did a score Kappa
[5:11:16] fanrlanz: lol, huni yesterday
[5:12:10] yudai95: @Vashnaroth isnt static shiv on hit effect?
[5:12:15] 안녕ㅋㅋ: why ban me?
[5:12:29] SkyTrax1989: you posted links? :S
[5:12:37] Vashnaroth: Yea but it's one hit every x attacks and I think it only procs on the main autoattack
[5:12:39] Bandillo64: its an energize effect like warlords or rapidfire
[5:12:51] MagikLimbo: corki mid ResidentSleeper galio mid ResidentSleeper
[5:13:02] NicOnTwitch: frosk hits her p's so hard
[5:13:05] Vashnaroth: meanwhile effects like BotrK and Rageblade are applied to every single bolt and aa
[5:13:08] yudai95: @Vashnaroth but since u stack attack speed with kogmaw, it means u get a lot of static shiv procs, which is good aoe damage no?
[5:13:11] ataturkzz: gj
[5:13:33] Vashnaroth: You already have AOE dmg built in his kit and Runaan's, there are better options
[5:13:36] Bandillo64: runaans with other on hit effects gives more aoe dmg
[5:13:51] creepingdeath241: Jebaited ?
[5:13:53] yudai95: which tiems shoudl i pick
[5:14:00] Bandillo64: other ads just dont go it because most dont have things like kogmaw w
[5:14:01] yudai95: with runnann
[5:14:07] 안녕ㅋㅋ: Why can not send links
[5:14:25] Vashnaroth: It depends on the champion
[5:14:26] Bandillo64: depends on the game but botr is good vs high hp targets
[5:14:39] 안녕ㅋㅋ: i am chinese so i dont know
[5:14:42] Vashnaroth: BotrK is generally really good as first item in most ccases
[5:14:43] Bandillo64: wits end when enemies have magic dmg/your team has magic dmg
[5:14:46] SkyTrax1989: @pawn1224 chat rules just respect them
[5:15:05] Bandillo64: rageblade always works as a 3rd item
[5:15:37] Vashnaroth: Also at the guy who said "LUL Kassa ban": I think it was to prep up the Corki pick
[5:15:48] yudai95: what about duskblade?
[5:15:56] Vashnaroth: since Kassadin is actually a great pick into Corki due to his magic damage reduction
[5:16:11] Bandillo64: no duskblade you dont need penetration
[5:16:16] Vashnaroth: Duskblade you build on Lethality adcs (Jhin, Miss Fortune)
[5:16:31] 안녕ㅋㅋ: admin i am sorry really
[5:16:32] MalphasX: Worst casting duo
[5:16:45] Bandillo64: you shred tanks with your %hp dmg and q

[5:20:45] yudai95: is thresh a tank support?
[5:20:51] nemostreamo: kha is kind of weird in this team comp
[5:21:02] SkyTrax1989: Chinese looks like StickEmojis Kappa
[5:21:29] Vashnaroth: @dubu_dubu They needed another damage threat outside of Cait and he works well with Taric and Galio tho
[5:21:30] lassesays: wheres the kogmaw
[5:21:30] yudai95: ok
[5:21:36] yudai95: who are the most tanky supp?
[5:21:43] wowan116: passive lol. U loose again, maybe go fight?
[5:21:45] yudai95: tom kench and braum?
[5:21:49] Vashnaroth: Braum/Taric/Tahm Kench
[5:21:51] ssw_soft: i think thresh is not tank supp.
[5:21:54] Bandillo64: braum leona tahm
[5:21:58] lassesays: alistar :D
[5:22:00] nemostreamo: yeah the only thing i can think of is the nice taric synergy but i guess that shows how few damage dealers are meta in the jungle
[5:22:03] f532253947: alistar maybe
[5:22:03] Vashnaroth: Also Alistar
[5:22:03] NovaVaughan: taric
[5:22:04] Bandillo64: oh yes ali
[5:22:05] 안녕ㅋㅋ: StickEmojis is what goole can not translate it
[5:22:19] yudai95: soraka....
[5:22:33] yudai95: soraka is my favourite tank jungler
[5:22:35] Vashnaroth: Don't play Leona she's really bad right now WutFace Rakan does what Leona does but better
[5:22:38] Bandillo64: lul
[5:22:45] fanrlanz: SNG is just trolling now
[5:22:46] Bandillo64: true that
[5:22:56] nemostreamo: Leona is engage and feed, Rakan is engage and win
[5:23:03] yudai95: is tresh an iniciator?
[5:23:14] ssw_soft: dat taric play was good
[5:23:20] MagikLimbo: bad roam
[5:23:20] Vashnaroth: He's mostly a pick champion
[5:23:29] Bandillo64: @yudai95 he can be yes
[5:23:47] WhoKnowsUA: thresh is kinda bad when your team behind, but like godlike when ahead
[5:23:59] yudai95: jsut like yasuo and riven
[5:24:06] Bandillo64: thresh can atleast peel with e and ult
[5:24:07] xcpn: kS Kappa
[5:24:15] yudai95: when ur team is behind yasuo and riven are bad, but when ur winning
[5:24:20] Bandillo64: blitz is useless af when behind BibleThump
[5:24:23] WhoKnowsUA: whe his team behind it's often he hook some1 but every1 lack of damage and it's like 1 for 5 trade usually
[5:24:30] wowan116: Again 4 kills?
[5:24:33] Vashnaroth: Thresh is good in SoloQ because people go around the map at random
[5:24:41] Vashnaroth: And you can catch them with Q and kill them
[5:24:51] yudai95: is blitz a tank jungler?
[5:24:54] FutureBeyondgt: smashing KappaPride
[5:24:59] xcpn: NA FLASH Keepo
[5:25:00] nemostreamo: thresh is picked for his hook in solo queue and for his lantern and flay in pro play
[5:25:10] lDEXTORI: RACISTTT
[5:25:14] Bandillo64: blitz is like thresh but much more all in
[5:25:25] xcpn: NA sappling
[5:25:39] ASkyNightly: YOU DOCTA YET?
[5:25:42] yudai95: which hook is easier to land thresh or blitz?
[5:25:42] MagikLimbo: racist stereotyping, fined
[5:25:43] nemostreamo: tanks (puke)
[5:25:47] f532253947: so tanky WutFace
[5:25:49] Bandillo64: you have no get out button you hook and start the fight
[5:26:01] Bandillo64: blitz vs lower elo thresh vs higher
[5:26:01] wowan116: Afk gaming NotLikeThis
[5:26:05] MichaelToost: Super Noob Gamers 4Head
[5:26:08] WhoKnowsUA: @yudai95 yeah true but if i would choose riven or yasuo i will choose riven 10 of 10 times, she's really strong late with 45 cdr and alot of flat ad with that AD scaling shield, plus if she's behind she can peel for her adc, i often do that in soloq
[5:26:11] Bandillo64: atleast for me
[5:26:19] xcpn: FLASH PogChamp
[5:26:41] Bandillo64: blitz always looks at the direction he hooks so its easier to predict
[5:26:52] Vashnaroth: If anything SNG would like to group up and siege/force teamfights but their engage is kinda abysmal
[5:26:59] Vashnaroth: So they don't know what to do
[5:27:04] fanrlanz: NotLikeThis how did this SNG take down RNG b4
[5:27:09] WhoKnowsUA: @Bandillo64 blitz is more of an all in cheesy pick bcs thresh is kinda strong in 2 v 2 bcs of his utilit and free damage from skills + E
[5:27:13] 안녕ㅋㅋ: 全都是英语 没中文》
[5:27:21] Vashnaroth: Also they have no map control so no picks with Kha
[5:27:40] Bandillo64: @regrup ye agreed
[5:28:05] yudai95: and perkz
[5:28:08] G0TH666: ????? £
[5:28:10] yudai95: perkz is a super star

[5:28:58] yudai95: imaqpie? dyrus?
[5:29:04] PleaseGoGame2: if doublelift is superstar then consider forgiven as well
[5:29:05] MalphasX: Bjerg and DL choke at worlds
[5:29:08] TopherOfOz: Ssumday?
[5:29:11] yudai95: imaqtpie and dyrus and mikeyeung are LoL legends
[5:29:18] nosJax: froggen is still the highest DPM and DMG% of any player in the world... he's still a superstar.
[5:29:20] 안녕ㅋㅋ: 你说@Whitewing789
[5:29:22] IYIFlame: Sp4zie
[5:29:27] WhoKnowsUA: @islothlove2 yeah plus thresh is better than blitz when behind or against alot of fatty bruisers which u don't want to hook, while as blitz u have like 0 impact in fight with huge frontlane
[5:29:28] hapserenbabs: Huhi that have dominated every league (NA EU AND LCS
[5:29:35] WhiteWing789: @pawn1224 不知道该说啥 。 - 。
[5:29:55] yudai95: @Regrup yeah, but thresh doesnt have a truck skin does he?
[5:29:56] 안녕ㅋㅋ: 爱 终于有说中文的了
[5:29:58] RustyTheCaster: Forgiven hasn't been a star for as long as DL
[5:29:58] Bandillo64: goldenglue superstar VoHiYo
[5:30:04] nightfallbott: Where's the golden Kappa check
[5:30:05] ssw_soft: haters gonna hate froggen is a superstar
[5:30:05] yudai95: @Regrup thus blitz > thresh
[5:30:08] RustyTheCaster: it's just such a vague opinionated discussion
[5:30:09] NicOnTwitch: omg how could I have forgotten the man, the myth, the legend IMAQTPIE, even have his stream on in the background
[5:30:12] 안녕ㅋㅋ: 你在国内还是国外 兄弟？》
[5:30:16] prigovor_: @SSG_Crown DL>Uzi confrimed at Worlds PogChamp
[5:30:23] TopherOfOz: Is Ssumday not a superstar? Pretty sure he's considered best top laner world
[5:30:26] yudai95: @RUSTYTheCASTER my LoL legends are: imaqtpie, dyrus and faker
[5:30:28] WhiteWing789: @pawn1224 哈哈哈，不太喜欢中文解说员，在这里看比较好
[5:30:29] nightfallbott: WHAT ABOUT THE GENERAL. LONG LIVE THEODDONE
[5:30:30] Bandillo64: blitz > thresh if you dont have too much experience with them
[5:30:37] WhiteWing789: @pawn1224 这段时间在上海
[5:30:38] Vengeancez93: I'd say Aphromoo qualifies as a superstar
[5:30:40] RustyTheCaster: Then we look at Toyz
[5:30:41] Cell_Kl: IMAQTPIE is the ADC GOAT of the rift
[5:30:48] MalphasX: Longevity means nothing when DL was known for eating skillshots
[5:30:48] Bandillo64: but thresh > blitz if you are a main/otp
[5:30:57] PleaseGoGame2: Godgiven top adc along with uzi.....then rest are just stars
[5:30:58] NicOnTwitch: wtf is an adc goat?
[5:31:02] RustyTheCaster: Faker, Toyz, Bjergsen, the bottom lane of skt
[5:31:07] Vashnaroth: Westdoor and AN are also LMS legends Kappa
[5:31:08] RustyTheCaster: goat = greatest of all time
[5:31:12] 안녕ㅋㅋ: 你挂vpn 了吗？
[5:31:21] TopherOfOz: @Nicontwitch goat = greatest of all time
[5:31:30] yudai95: i cant see imaqtpie in ur list @RUSTYTheCASTER
[5:31:30] WhiteWing789: @pawn1224 嗯 ， 用 VPN 不然几乎打不开
[5:31:30] MalphasX: Bjerg solo killed twice by jensen LUL
[5:31:33] IYIFlame: pray + gorilla
[5:31:33] NicOnTwitch: @RUSTYTheCASTER @TopherOfOz ahhh, k thanks
[5:31:40] 안녕ㅋㅋ: 我加你好友了
[5:31:47] SSG_Crown: DL > imp/bang/deft/pray ... yee Kappa
[5:31:50] Vengeancez93: @RUSTYTheCASTER Aphromoo? Been a pro since season 1 and consistently rated a top support by multiple regions.
[5:31:53] WhiteWing789: @pawn1224 好好，私聊吧
[5:31:59] Cell_Kl: i was joking btw... imaqtpie is just a great streamer, average ad
[5:32:09] RustyTheCaster: I'm tempted to say Aphro as well
[5:32:18] yudai95: whos aphro?
[5:32:18] YourH1GHness: Imaqtpie is an entertainer not a legend.
[5:32:22] yudai95: i dotn even know who apro is
[5:32:26] Vashnaroth: What about Clearlove? His legacy is undeniable
[5:32:27] RustyTheCaster: Aphromoo
[5:32:30] TopherOfOz: @Cell_Kl average professional adc* He's a beast solo queue adc
[5:32:32] Cell_Kl: aphromoo
[5:32:40] GosuGirl69: Aphromoo plays for CLG
[5:32:42] yudai95: who does aphrommoplay for?
[5:32:48] NicOnTwitch: Greatest of all time, one in each role - Flame, Dandy, Faker, Uzi, Madlife
[5:32:50] yudai95: CLG :puke:
[5:32:51] chrysopelea: soaz
[5:33:00] TopherOfOz: @yudai95 Counter Logic Gaming (CLG)
[5:33:01] ASkyNightly: I like support APHRO, but adc aphro was legendary
[5:33:04] RustyTheCaster: Clearlove is an interesting one, I don't think I would call him a superstar because he has always had better players on his team
[5:33:04] dheihwjabz: wtf is that galio
[5:33:06] Bandillo64: b-b-but clg is cool BibleThump
[5:33:12] RustyTheCaster: Clearlove is a star, but not a superstar
[5:33:20] wowan116: And?
[5:33:21] Vashnaroth: Fair nough
[5:33:25] WhoKnowsUA: If u're new to the game alot of ppl make the same mistake follow hook as Thresh, while Blitz early can hook pretty much anyone without alot of punishment
[5:33:30] RustyTheCaster: Kid = 443
[5:33:31] Bandillo64: and i dont like the clearlove worlds debuff :/
[5:33:44] WhoKnowsUA: so yes for newer players blitz is much better fitting
[5:33:48] MalphasX: CL carried EDG in the LPL when Deft was on the team
[5:33:52] xcpn: PogCHamp RNG
[5:33:54] yudai95: greatest of all time: soaz, broxah , perkz, that fnatic bot lane
[5:33:56] RustyTheCaster: Yes but Deft was the superstar
[5:33:57] xcpn: PogChamp
[5:33:59] Vengeancez93: I think Ambition is close to superstar level as well.
[5:34:08] CsicsiXD: Type 1 if Froskurinn is the best grill on Riot Productions
[5:34:10] f532253947: he always choke at worlds
[5:34:19] TopherOfOz: @yudai95 Soaz? Not Ssumday? You crazy fam
[5:34:22] aslanxdefg: 2
[5:34:25] wowan116: 10 min passive game. Loose baron +8k gold NotLikeThis
[5:34:28] RustyTheCaster: Meiko was the real MSI MVP though
[5:34:32] banshee_beat: perkz goat? LOL
[5:34:33] Cell_Kl: imp not in the superstar conversation? seasons 3-5 he was a monster
[5:34:34] Vashnaroth: ^
[5:34:35] yudai95: soaz rekt ssumday top lane in RR
[5:34:41] Vashnaroth: EDG lived by the Meiko that year
[5:34:47] MalphasX: Ok but what jungler is a superstar?? No one cares about that role
[5:34:49] CsicsiXD: league is ded BabyRage
[5:34:50] Bandillo64: i think score could be called a superstar
[5:34:52] banshee_beat: ok yudai is troll lol
[5:34:56] wowan116: Leave, SNG, save my time
[5:35:02] yudai95: @MalphasX yet its the hardest role
[5:35:04] Levigeddon: @MalphasX Score definitely
[5:35:14] Roslerox: PEANUT YO
[5:35:16] MalphasX: Its not hard
[5:35:16] Vashnaroth: Score is getting there tbh
[5:35:19] Miitniick: perkz 0-4 vs CLG lol
[5:35:22] banshee_beat: Score is my fav player <3
[5:35:22] WhoKnowsUA: @vengeancez93 he's unlucky underrated dude but i really rate him high personally. He was top KR mid before Faker, then got faded bcs of Faker's talent, then he switched to jungle and shine there now. Personally i think he's a legend, just underrated alot
[5:35:29] f532253947: bengi
[5:35:30] yudai95: thats actually somethnig i dont get, people dont really care about jugnlers, they care more about mid laners, but isnt jungler the hardest role?
[5:35:38] Roslerox: Bengi fasho
[5:35:51] RustyTheCaster: People will always look at ADC and MID before JG or SUP and then nobody really considers top
[5:35:51] NicOnTwitch: There's got to be a special club for having a league term named after you e.g. Flame, Xpeke, Insec, any others?
[5:35:52] MalphasX: Bengi no loll
[5:35:52] TopherOfOz: Every role has something that makes it difficult. No role harder than any other in my opinion. Except maybe top for teams that put top on island
[5:35:56] aslanxdefg: insec is a jngl legend imo
[5:35:56] Vengeancez93: What about Madlife? obviously not so great now but was world renowned for years.
[5:35:58] AngieFoxtrot: Perhaps a better words for some of these people who be Legend
[5:36:00] RustyTheCaster: Smeb is OP
[5:36:00] Bandillo64: @yudai95 jungle needs the most knowledge yes but mechanically other roles are harder
[5:36:09] Roslerox: Bengi is probably #1 over Faker. Most consistent player to EVER play
[5:36:17] CsicsiXD: Smeb is bae* KappaPride
[5:36:17] Roslerox: imo
[5:36:20] yudai95: @Bandillo64 junger needs the msot map awareness by far
[5:36:23] Cell_Kl: INSEC the legend
[5:36:26] TopherOfOz: @vengeancez93 madlife kind of a one trick
[5:36:26] Thiagosnk1: gg
[5:36:26] RustyTheCaster: consistent enough to be relegated in the LPL ;)
[5:36:28] MalphasX: There is a reason Bengi failed hard once he left SKT
[5:36:30] Vashnaroth: Flame is historically a monster toplaner, right now probably Smeb
[5:36:30] WhoKnowsUA: @yudai95 how the most busted and impactful role can be hardes lol? u basically don't see your counterpart while laners fight enemies since the start of the game, while junglers PVEing most of the time lol
[5:36:31] Cell_Kl: the creator of the lee sin ward kick
[5:36:37] NicOnTwitch: @islothlove2 yeah lol, just saw that :)
[5:37:03] Levigeddon: @Regrup I smell the silver LUL
[5:37:03] wowan116: RNG full hp all
[5:37:06] Roslerox: It really depends on who you like honestly. There's a bias there.
[5:37:11] wowan116: Nice damage
[5:37:11] Bandillo64: man this series was so one sided we spent like 1 hour just talking about stuff
[5:37:16] Bandillo64: FeelsBadMan
[5:37:22] Roslerox: @bandillo64 lol true
[5:37:27] TopherOfOz: Lol
[5:37:28] Vashnaroth: GG RNG 4Head
[5:37:29] MalphasX: SKT fans even shit on Bengi.
[5:37:34] NicOnTwitch: tfw missed watching second half of game because discussing league superstars
[5:37:40] RustyTheCaster: But he kept playing and started losing, a superstar moving for money does tarnish their record
[5:37:41] TopherOfOz: Game wasn't as entertaining as talking about GOATs of league
[5:37:41] yudai95: i thought jungler was the hardest role because the macro of the role is really hard
[5:37:51] Roslerox: Faker wouldn't have been sht without Bengi
[5:38:01] kynsareth: yudai95 that's a lto of it
[5:38:01] deliciouscupcakes77: Don't you ever think they will bump heads HEHEHEH
[5:38:02] RagoDK: Bow
[5:38:02] MalphasX: LOL
[5:38:07] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon plat last 3 seasons, what about u?
[5:38:08] Vashnaroth: Well I think it's also nice to talk with other LoL fans once in a while, no?
[5:38:10] Thiagosnk1: 10/10
[5:38:16] TopherOfOz: @RUSTYTheCASTER doesn't tarnish if he continues winning with new team
[5:38:21] CsicsiXD: The synced bow Kreygasm
[5:38:23] kynsareth: Bengi is great when Nunu is meta
[5:38:26] RustyTheCaster: Yes @TopherOfOz, however he didn't
[5:38:29] kynsareth: his macro is awesome
[5:38:33] Recinius: did u guys even watch lck season 6? bengi was shit
[5:38:34] Roslerox: I'm just glad chat isn't doing that EU v NA crap. That gets so old.
[5:38:36] Levigeddon: @Regrup No jungle main either but at least i don't trashtalk that role
[5:38:39] AngieFoxtrot: What about poor XPeke
[5:38:40] 厉害大王: RNG=Royal Need GA/Y KappaPride
[5:38:46] filipdit: 2018 #Western LCS inc. PogChamp
[5:38:50] Levigeddon: @Roslerox Don't mention FailFish
[5:38:55] RustyTheCaster: Deft is more of a superstar than Bengi
[5:38:57] TopherOfOz: @RUSTYTheCASTER agreed, just saying you can't blame the guy for going where the money is. You aren't gonna be a pro gamer for much longer than a few years. Gotta cash in lol
[5:38:57] Miitniick: miss old TPA BibleThump
[5:39:01] Bandillo64: uzi buff CL debuff BibleThump
[5:39:03] deliciouscupcakes77: Take the wheel Jesus BlessRNG BlessRNG BlessRNG BlessRNG
[5:39:09] Roslerox: @levigeddon Ya it probably would set someone off lol
[5:39:16] yudai95: if jungler isnt hardest role what is it?
[5:39:23] yudai95: maybe mid since they need good map awareness tono?
[5:39:26] Roslerox: S2 TPA was so fun. Bebe ftw
[5:39:27] TopherOfOz: Top hardest role
[5:39:31] yudai95: and mid needs good mechanicle skill right?
[5:39:32] RustyTheCaster: @TopherOfOz for sure man, he made his choice
[5:39:35] deliciouscupcakes77: Razzzzzzzle dazzzzzzzzle
[5:39:40] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon jungle got buffed every season since s3 when i started playing there, more gold. more xp more camps since then. And it was the most impactufl after mid in season 3
[5:39:45] NicOnTwitch: Mata, Pawn gonna be two time world champs?
[5:39:47] nickthierry: 1.4K LUL
[5:39:53] Vashnaroth: @TopherOfOz Most pro players stop competing at a young age, you still have time to make a living in the "real world", if you're a pro you should aim for the top
[5:39:59] AngieFoxtrot: Easyhoon BibleThump
[5:40:04] Roslerox: I've always been a fan of IMP too
[5:40:09] Levigeddon: @Regrup Still you need map awareness and a good macro level
[5:40:12] MalphasX: Only Uzi out cses a Cait lane that was bullying early.
[5:40:23] yudai95: @Regrup well u get even on xp and gold with other lanes if u dont go for ganks right?
[5:40:30] Bandillo64: varus is good vs cait tho
[5:40:35] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon still most challengers in the ladder are junglers/mids
[5:40:38] yudai95: @Regrup but with jungler u need to help ur lanes
[5:40:46] yudai95: @Regrup u cant just killcamps 24/7
[5:40:49] TopherOfOz: @Vashnaroth yeah but if you're 18-25 years old and have an opportunity to make 200k/year for 5 years you should take the money. You can save for school and for rainy days.
[5:40:49] Bandillo64: and taric supp is a sitting duck
[5:40:55] Miitniick: goat of jg : insec
[5:41:11] 厉害大王: Xiao hu=baby Tiger
[5:41:24] MalphasX: Jungle is really not that hard...
[5:41:32] TopherOfOz: GOAT jungle METEOSSSS
[5:41:35] Vashnaroth: Would be nice to see LoL keep going for a long time
[5:41:40] 안녕ㅋㅋ: Chinese people should have slept to foreign friends
[5:41:50] 안녕ㅋㅋ: bye bye
[5:41:51] AngieFoxtrot: You spelled that wrong, it's Memeos ;)
[5:41:52] Vashnaroth: And have legends playing for a long time and still be relevant as it happens in CS:GO
[5:42:12] RustyTheCaster: bye @pawn1224 !
[5:42:19] Levigeddon: @Regrup I wouldn't call this an argument. The second most played champion in bronze is thresh and he isn't weak because of that
[5:42:22] TopherOfOz: Does CSGO have people playing for long time
[5:42:24] WhoKnowsUA: @yudai95 i didn't said junglers didn't rely on their team to be even or ahead atleast to be relevant but he decide alot in the early. And since season 3 it's much more harder to resist ganks bcs of how much gold and XP they get plus autocatch mechanics
[5:42:31] CsicsiXD: Big Hair PogChamp
[5:42:33] AngieFoxtrot: Piglet BibleThump TL BibleThump
[5:42:34] sleezyhoon: @roslerox 2015 was the best SKT season
[5:42:36] MalphasX: Well Season 3 Worlds was my fav Worlds as well.
[5:42:43] Miitniick: last week of lck and NA lcs BibleThump
[5:42:53] TopherOfOz: The only CSGO pro I've ever known of was Summit1maltov
[5:42:58] 안녕ㅋㅋ: bye@RUSTYTheCASTER
[5:43:08] DrHonker: no more games tonight, right?
[5:43:12] noodle_soupi: damm that hair is disturbing
[5:43:12] MalphasX: C9 probably won't make Worlds 'cause Jensen is 1vs5 too many games.
[5:43:15] 厉害大王: MLXG=Spicy hot pot
[5:43:36] Miitniick: @MalphasX kda player lul
[5:43:48] CsicsiXD: No C9 on worlds? BibleThump
[5:43:51] Vashnaroth: @TopherOfOz Gambit Gaming won the last Major and their in-game leader, Zeus, is 30 years old
[5:43:55] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon i personaly hate junglers bcs when they havn't that much gold/xp i could play much safer to resist their ganks, now i can't, now matter how safe i'm playing if the choose my lane it's pretty much matter of time when i will die or just leave lane for 5 min completely
[5:44:04] MalphasX: Bjerg is prob the KDA player. Sitting behind Bio, Sven and Hauntzer every game and cleanup.
[5:44:10] yudai95: for me ADC is hardest role mechanicly, but easiest role when it comes to macro, jungle is hardest role when it comes to mechanics but hardest macro and mid lane is like good mechanics and good macro
[5:44:21] Vashnaroth: There's a bunch of old players who came from Counterstrike 1.6 and Source that kept playing
[5:44:24] 厉害大王: KonCha KonCha bye
[5:44:44] MalphasX: Skill difference in shooters is almost nonexistant. Who cares about shooters.
[5:44:46] WhoKnowsUA: @yudai95 supp is the easiest mechanical role, plus u don't need to lasthit
[5:45:03] yudai95: oh yeah supp is easy mechanicly
[5:45:06] Miitniick: support is the best role ... doesnt get credit but impact the game than anyone else
[5:45:17] Levigeddon: @Regrup I agree. But you called junglers "busted" that fight PVE most of the time but if they are doing camps, they can't gank you ;)
[5:45:27] yudai95: for me hardest role is either jungle or mid
[5:45:34] MalphasX: Shooters aren't hard lol
[5:45:37] yudai95: mayeb adc, since its pretty hard mechanicly
[5:45:53] astropuma: RedCoat
[5:46:00] MalphasX: Betting 'man'
[5:46:07] yudai95: @Kyle__twitch mechanicly
[5:46:11] Miitniick: support is easy mechanically lol really
[5:46:15] MalphasX: Nothing hard about shooters.
[5:46:18] BootOfficiaI: lol adc hard mechanically
[5:46:26] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon i mean u fight for each CS as laner and if u fucked up u can lose lane, get behind or straight die, while junglers basically PVeing at the start and then having fun camping some1 while getting the same gold and XP, how's that not busted and fair?
[5:46:42] yudai95: @Miitniick it probably dependso nthe supprots, like hooks are not always ez to land imo
[5:46:45] DoctorSurgeon: :B
[5:46:50] BootOfficiaI: @Regrup bc u need to actually know how to jungle not just farm
[5:47:00] MalphasX: There are good women csgo players but no women League players. Gotcha.
[5:47:02] Recinius: @Regrup u clearly dont understand what junglers do
[5:47:10] Levigeddon: @Regrup If the gank fails you lose time and your camps if the enemy jungler decides to invade. Or he counterganks or just ganks another lane. There are plenty of options
[5:47:13] Vashnaroth: @Regrup Jungling is about understanding your champ's strenghts, pathing in the most efficient way and vision/objective control
[5:47:19] Roslerox: lol @ arguing chat
[5:47:25] Vashnaroth: It's not just ganks
[5:47:26] yudai95: @Kyle__twitch imo csgo is much harder than LOL and other mobs mechanicly, but is it harder strategicly ?
[5:47:43] Miitniick: @yudai95 im a supp main everytime babysit that lame adc .. ward the map and get flame after lol
[5:47:52] Vashnaroth: @yudai95 At high levels? Yes, starting from the fact that you have more than 1 map
[5:47:57] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon before yes, now u have catchup mechanics, Check reddit where Tarzened created thread about removing catchup mechanics bcs it's really bad
[5:48:14] Vashnaroth: Execution of strategies vary vastly between CT and T side as well
[5:48:35] nickthierry: SeemsGood
[5:48:36] xniverz: RNG WIN?
[5:48:39] MalphasX: CSGO is easier than Pokemon games LUL
[5:48:41] Vashnaroth: Well, bye everyone HeyGuys
[5:48:46] nickthierry: HeyGuys
[5:48:51] Bingjian: 2：0
[5:48:55] Roslerox: League had like 125 champs and knowing CDs etc. Playing multiple maps in CS isn't that difficult. Still shooting.
[5:49:00] Bingjian: yea RNG WIN
[5:49:02] elderikp: without catchup mechanics a game can be over at 5 mins and they need to play out another 15 minute of game time which is super boring to watch
[5:49:18] MalphasX: There is no depth to a shooter.
[5:49:22] Miitniick: playing all supports expect janna lul
[5:49:41] Levigeddon: @Regrup I already read this and yes, its probably not balanced enough. But this is still no reason to call jungle an "easy" role
[5:49:51] Roslerox: UZI = Baller
[5:50:18] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon well again check challenger ladders on each servers, which role have more players
[5:50:47] Levigeddon: @Regrup So you want to say that more junglers became challenger in the last patches because of that ?
[5:50:50] Recinius: regrup probably main tanks top LUL just sitting there farming and join 30 mins in being unstopable
[5:50:57] MalphasX: Junglers look for ganks early, even if they only do 1 successful gank they get carried later and later in the game. There is rarely any pressure on them to win a teamfight or what not.
[5:51:22] MalphasX: Smiting is their toughest task after lane.
[5:51:33] yudai95: malphax whats hardest role for u?
[5:51:52] WhoKnowsUA: @Levigeddon i'm saying most of challengers clearly saying pcik jungler and get freelo
[5:52:10] MalphasX: Mid and adc 'cause they have to outplay and carry teamfights. We see so many mids and adc's fail for a reason. Whereas Mike Yeung new jungler owning older junglers.
[5:52:43] Levigeddon: @Regrup Im pretty sure that they dont do. Its the same like saying "pick a tank top" and youre save
[5:52:53] MalphasX: Svenskeren fails plenty and TSM still best team 'cause Hauntzer starts good teamfights and then they win it cause of adc and mid dmg.
