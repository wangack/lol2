[0:14:45] slayer78456: I played the Demo it was okay. It's a mix of combat and farming.
[0:14:49] DCHenkels: He got early access
[0:14:51] Toadv1ne: @ReginaldXIV I'm in the same boat, I'm not super optimistic.
[0:14:53] Reijm11: Harvestella does like kind of good
[0:14:55] RVIII: I just need to know how it runs on a steam deck
[0:15:15] ReginaldXIV: Switch and PC
