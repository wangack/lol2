[1:04:33] CasterFroskurinn: hyper aggressive. He was playing kog maw and the enemy jungler ganked and he didn't hesitate, insta flashed onto the other adc and killed him before dying to tower to deny the jungler
[1:04:40] goblinguy01: I wonder when some LMS players will go to the LPL like Chawy and Ziv :P
[1:05:09] shadowknight146: china prefer import korean in general
[1:05:11] ACypher: zhanqisususu is from RNG academy

[1:12:02] NiceRex602: @CasterFroskurinn why isnt there any relegation for LPL this split?
[1:12:03] CasterFroskurinn: meta shifted out of them. Athena is slumping.
[1:12:06] goblinguy01: He was the reason why they won 2 games against FW at S6 worlds

[1:13:13] pnkuU: @CasterFroskurinn Frosk, there is one very important question: How does War Horse taste, if u tried it yet?
[1:13:15] armaann: Wait Heal Barrier is meta in Kog/Lulu lanes in LPL?
[1:13:27] CasterFroskurinn: @neonpinku haven't tasted it
[1:13:37] Rudiko: windspeakers and heal synergy
[1:13:39] pnkuU: Not only in LPL @armaann
[1:13:42] goblinguy01: KogMaw is meta in China ^^
[1:13:57] armaann: has it been played in other regions?
[1:14:00] PapaSmithy: Who's iBoy
[1:14:00] goblinguy01: Before it became meta
[1:14:01] pnkuU: @CasterFroskurinn oh, unfortunate.
[1:14:05] NiceRex602: Bengi with Rush now FeelsBadMan teamless probably trying to feed ungrateful sisters FeelsBadMan
[1:14:10] CasterFroskurinn: their new young ADC

[1:14:19] steven1566: Meiko is the best Chinese player now
[1:14:19] NiceRex602: PapaSmithy GivePLZ
[1:14:20] CasterFroskurinn: yes
[1:14:25] PapaSmithy: interesting
[1:14:26] vic830710: even those braindead lpl fans know that scout is NOT chinese EleGiggle
[1:14:29] PapaSmithy: first game?
[1:14:33] Kembegrader: @papasmithy pogchamp
[1:14:35] CasterFroskurinn: No. He played last week
[1:14:37] shadowknight146: yes started now
[1:14:41] PapaSmithy: early thoughts?
[1:14:46] CasterFroskurinn: He looked very good. Hard to say without much tape
[1:14:54] NiceRex602: If jin air doesnt 2-0 doesnt that mean Afreeca wiin because of head to head @ PapaSmithy 🤔
[1:15:01] pnkuU: @armaann Not a lot do it. But there are some people that do it. Regardless of region. Prototype for example does it as well.
[1:15:02] CasterFroskurinn: really strong positioning but fairly braindead with builds. I'm assuming meiko just holds his *** for him
[1:15:10] PapaSmithy: head to head doesnt count as a tiebreaker for final standings
[1:15:15] PapaSmithy: so if Jin Air 2-1 it's a tiebreaker
[1:15:22] NiceRex602: oh ok GivePLZ
[1:15:45] NiceRex602: MEIKO Kreygasm best chinese support

[1:34:50] DanielSPoA: Riot said those regions would get 1 spot each, will be there some sort of play-ins like MSI?
[1:34:55] Recinius: they should just scrap one wild card team and let lck bring 4 teams
[1:34:55] DanielSPoA: Viet gets an extra spot
[1:34:56] chhopsky: i believe in miracles
[1:34:58] scottoflorida2014: They changed the rules somewhat so I am not sure how wildcard wiorks this year
[1:35:01] vic830710: gpl has 2 and the other wildcards have 1 seed

[1:35:42] hobo_monkey: @recinius It really wouldn't be worlds if it was mainly Koreans.

[1:54:50] 420juicelord69: why doesn't anyone watch LPL
[1:54:51] CasterFroskurinn: All the music on the English LPL stream are hand picked by our team for approval for play in Australia

[1:55:28] 420juicelord69: @casterfroskurinn what lane do you main?
[1:55:41] CasterFroskurinn: The LPL English is currently owned by Riot Shanghai but outsourced to the Riot OCE team. Tencent provides some resources. But there is a better relationship between Riot Shanghai and Tencent than Riot OCE and Tencent.
[1:55:46] plasticspoonn: watching lpl at 3am on mute listening to old jay-z...what has my life become evoMindBlown

[2:04:56] CasterFroskurinn: @PenguinGod__ many new casters don't know the difference between and analyst and a caster. You're there to tell a story of the game, not just explain how things work. And above all: be entertaining. Tell an entertaining and educating narrative!

[2:05:34] BesTossLoL: like dodosin Keppo
[2:05:52] edgelordweeb: be crumbzz and just talk shit and call people boosted monkeys and push the boundaries of what you can say on stream, easy way to become best caster
[2:05:53] PapaSmithy: Froskurinn in 2017 PogChamp
[2:05:54] Zdycopter: what
[2:05:57] CasterFroskurinn: @zoomenhanced Mercy. We call banter "showmanship" - it's your flair or personal style of casting and it should always build up the moment, not detract.
[2:05:59] Zdycopter: ???

[2:18:46] Hi_ImPhantomere: TSM is gonna make top 3 at worlds this year without a doubt
[2:19:03] CasterFroskurinn: LPPL was the academy league in a sense in that a lot of orgs had secondary teams and you could choose to sub out of the LPPL to be subbed onto the LPL roster
[2:19:14] CasterFroskurinn: where as LSPL was like challegner and actually tried to qualify a new spot into the LPL

[2:20:20] CasterFroskurinn: @Snowbear22 now they have the LDL and abolished some of the other leagues and the LDL will be a traveling circuit, I believe, and promote into the LPL
[2:20:25] Hi_ImPhantomere: If TSM played a Bof5 against WE it would be 3-0 easily

[3:11:54] 花村_さゆり: @MisakiKureha and then fix the game for worlds Kappa
[3:12:14] michaelsund: 3-5 patches? I dont remember Janna being balanced since i started this game MingLee

[3:12:42] AmazingSalvia: @MisakiKureha but those 3-5 patches are 3-5 weeks, not like other games where things can be broken for years

[3:13:21] edgelordweeb: pretty much everything in league is complete aids but it's somehow enjoyable
[3:13:34] NA_Jayce: DansGame ing
[3:13:47] MisakiKureha: @AmazingSalvia well in some cases its true, but not always
[3:13:58] pnkuU: @MisakiKureha me neither, cause league is - in comparison to other mobas - pretty balanced.
[3:14:19] 花村_さゆり: Dawngate was amazing
[3:14:29] 花村_さゆり: and then it died while still in beta FeelsBadMan
[3:14:57] edgelordweeb: I had a friend who played dota 2 and every game he has brazilian kids screaming at him and threating to ddos him
[3:15:12] edgelordweeb: *threatening
[3:15:51] 花村_さゆり: Dota 2 is an anime
[3:16:01] 花村_さゆり: every player thinks they are the main character
[3:16:14] edgelordweeb: that's league though
[3:16:30] NA_Jayce: @zoomenhanced that's every moba
[3:16:45] edgelordweeb: it's because losing in mobas is aids you actually can't do anything if you're super far behind
[3:16:45] MisakiKureha: @neonpinku well especially if you count how many champs and items there are it seems okey, but sometimes they screw up hard :D like when guinsoo was broken and built on everything and stuff like that
[3:17:08] 花村_さゆり: i think the comeback factor is higher in Dota2 then it is in LoL
[3:17:15] 花村_さゆり: in Dota2 you can comeback from anything
[3:17:20] 花村_さゆり: in LoL if you're behind you're gone
[3:17:42] edgelordweeb: in LoL you just hope the enemy team chimps out really hard and just ints
[3:17:57] NA_Jayce: @edgelordweeb LUL
[3:17:59] pnkuU: @MisakiKureha sure, don't wanna say it never happens. but not too often and often it gets fixed next patch or hotfixed the same patch. unless it's preseason, but thats preseason for ya.
[3:18:06] free7221: 了
[3:18:19] Cyrodilian: It should be gg - if you spend tome building an advantage the enemy shouldn't be able to come back
[3:18:21] 花村_さゆり: this preseason LoL changes forever
[3:18:41] maltkat: why
[3:18:45] 花村_さゆり: well that's the differnece between Dota2 games and LoL games
[3:18:46] edgelordweeb: if you int hard enough it's possible
[3:18:55] YOLOallRARES: snake need to do something. Cho'gat freefarm is scary
[3:18:58] 花村_さゆり: dota2 is balanced anyone can power win or comeback
[3:19:03] 花村_さゆり: LoL is like tiled
[3:19:23] pnkuU: unless youre playing in diamond or higher, people will always throw a lead.
[3:19:34] YOLOallRARES: no lol. in lol late game, you lose 1 combat = bye the game. In dota2 you can buy back and def
[3:19:35] 花村_さゆり: i beg to differ
[3:19:46] jungchaeyeon01: who win first series ?
[3:19:54] 甜野的小迷妹: EDG

[3:20:02] 花村_さゆり: i was bigfatlp stream and in Diamond they throw a 6 tower lead all the time
[3:20:26] edgelordweeb: if you think diamond+ doesn't throw go watch echo fox vods and tell me that again
[3:20:29] howlinghorsey: isn't EDG edward gaming? or am i confusing it with another team?
[3:20:32] maltkat: I'm following him too
[3:20:37] pnkuU: oh yeah it also happens in challenger but way less often
[3:20:58] pnkuU: @edgelordweeb i didnt say that at all
[3:21:27] edgelordweeb: dota is a harder game
