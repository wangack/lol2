[3:39:52] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: yeah if LPL players have a dispute they play chicken with their Lamborghinis
[3:40:03] TheTragicomical: Imagine being diagnosed with a disorder that only lets you feel secondhand embarrassment as your only emotion WutFace
[3:40:05] PulseIRL: Yeah I dunno, I think we need more villains in the ecosystem and punishing them just makes the scene boring
[3:40:11] TheTragicomical: JK, just look at Twitch chat haHAA
[3:40:13] grimrevolution: the worst thing is knowing that you could have just walked there, got the food, and walked back and the dude would have still been on the bike
[3:40:20] PulseIRL: lmao @TheTragicomical
[3:40:38] PulseIRL: @grimrevolution BibleThump
[3:40:50] TheTragicomical: @RiotPulse EU1 and 2 and NA 1 and 2 are absolutely abysmal, holy crap. Mods can't do their job because their is too much filth

[3:41:46] goblinguy01: Pulse, Frosk, Papa are good mods
[3:41:46] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: golden glue was last spotted donning a goofy costume and greeting disney vacationers
[3:41:52] TheTragicomical: @EUscarra I remember seeing a FEW games on there, and I just added it in there because it is ALL the same, man. Like it is the same chat, just swap team and player names
[3:41:55] grimrevolution: No! NO CRYING! Please I can't handle crying
[3:41:58] TheTragicomical: @RiotPulse BibleThump 7
[3:42:15] AngieFoxtrot: @RiotPulse Okay, I warn simply cause I know some people don't like hugs

[3:44:08] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: EDG destined to embarrass themselves at worlds the nth time in a row
[3:44:12] bgijy1: Sad to miss it. I love watching a good stomp
[3:44:34] grimrevolution: It wasn't a stomp they just dunked them into a dumpster
[3:44:35] MisakiKureha: @RicardoGetsHis_Revenge They will brake the ice this year , mark my words SwiftRage SwiftRage SwiftRage
[3:44:45] TheTragicomical: It's so weird watching eastern leagues, y'know? Because the casters seem much more lucid and the gameplay seems more... palpable though not too different in my eyes.
[3:44:50] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: iboy will bite into an ice cream cone and sever his jaw
[3:44:55] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: just like namei
[3:44:57] TheTragicomical: Different champs too, usually. Which is nice. Although it's 5 AM.
[3:45:03] WisperwindTFT: what happened to We1less/PainEvil/Godv
[3:45:57] goblinguy01: Poor Mickey, he is good. Now he rots in TL

[3:49:11] bgijy1: Isn't Shy on ROX, and considered a big name or something?
[3:49:15] michaelsund: Coutinho PogChamp MingLee
[3:49:30] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: they parade around his corpse sure, but he's been dead for awhile
[3:50:11] bgijy1: No, he's not, but he's still a big name people recognize
[3:50:44] bgijy1: yeah, ROX has looked pretty bad compared to the rest of the LCK
[3:51:15] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: i sure hope worlds introduces a melee no skill champ to showcase adcs skills
[3:51:34] grimrevolution: @DarrylHilbert there is no twitch, you can watch it on pandatv

[3:57:39] colearning: that's a top 3 LPL meme imo
[3:58:00] lipefuark: when is the final frmo return of the legends?
[3:58:20] WisperwindTFT: who is going there from Lpl?
[3:58:30] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: it's some season 1 safety bubble, koreans dont exist
[3:58:43] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: rapidstar would have crushed them all
[3:58:51] WisperwindTFT: Weixiao comeback?
[3:59:02] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: doubt he can find his mouse under all that money

[4:02:17] uziko_: Imp chose the money FeelsBadMan
[4:02:28] WisperwindTFT: Piglet is even more of a meme niw
[4:02:29] Í∑∏Î†òÎ¶∞1201: thought ump had carpal tunnel Kappa
[4:02:51] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: i'd like to think if piglet streams imp just donates insulting him

[4:05:00] WisperwindTFT: I kinda want to see vayne back in the meta
[4:05:25] FishRoeSoup: all vayne need is just some sort of wave clear
[4:05:27] WisperwindTFT: all those mechanical skilled adc's have to stick to Kalista .-.
[4:05:43] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: uzi played vayne last week
[4:05:51] grimrevolution: ^
[4:06:07] WisperwindTFT: I missed that than
[4:06:09] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: they are obsessed with kogmaw
[4:06:11] TheTragicomical: Vayne would be really rad to see in the meta. Or any champ that isn't in the unofficial rotation.
[4:06:12] grimrevolution: and he got static shiv too for wave clear
[4:06:26] Í∑∏Î†òÎ¶∞1201: ?
[4:06:31] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: the sooner cho gath is deleted from the game the better
[4:06:33] WisperwindTFT: that's usual for vayne rn
[4:06:58] WisperwindTFT: or at least for vayne mains
[4:07:07] WisperwindTFT: most bonobos just rush bork
[4:07:11] Í∑∏Î†òÎ¶∞1201: looks like LGD will never go back to being number 1 team in CN RIP
[4:07:30] RicardoGetsHis_Revenge: snake would be if they never threw
[4:07:37] FishRoeSoup: static shiv is not enough, vayne literately perma shoved in full laning phase
[4:07:58] WisperwindTFT: yeah but it helps
[4:08:31] WisperwindTFT: on the other hand
[4:08:40] WisperwindTFT: kog's waveclear sucks too

[4:21:33] WisperwindTFT: TL is the last place no matter what
[4:21:44] WisperwindTFT: Flyquest won today
[4:21:53] scottoflorida2014: P1 may have saved themselves by winning
[4:22:39] mujarshad: P1 didn't win?
[4:22:52] mujarshad: they have to win today vs fly
[4:23:01] michaelsund: Damn the bottom 4 are really close actually
[4:23:06] FishRoeSoup: P1 has one of the best roster on paper and somehow keep losing games
[4:23:11] mujarshad: EF is safe
[4:23:13] scottoflorida2014: Last week they were talking about it, they may have los since
[4:23:25] HakaruLovesU: Banana LOL best name ever
[4:23:30] mujarshad: p1 vs fly to decide second relegation team
[4:23:39] scottoflorida2014: looking right now

[4:25:16] PortableCorpse: LET'S GO SNG
[4:25:20] WisperwindTFT: Cho Gath is a stupid champion
[4:25:23] mujarshad: @scottofl2014 if they win vs fly they are 8th
[4:25:39] mujarshad: if fly wins, fly is 8th
[4:25:52] Team_Vertex: TRUMP CONFIRMED
[4:25:56] scottoflorida2014: How do they go from 3rd place to last in one split lol
[4:25:57] uziko_: imp 1v9
[4:26:05] goblinguy01: I just saw SKT get stomped map 1 against BBQ. Struggle early game against BBQ and only won off a misplay lol.
[4:26:14] goblinguy01: Losing a map to a 9th place team
[4:26:26] scottoflorida2014: @goblibguy01 That was great 25 minutes or something to
[4:26:30] michaelsund: Lck is so bad this year :/
[4:26:49] mujarshad: well they mismanaged their roster near the end of last split
[4:26:55] goblinguy01: @scottofl2014 SKT won game 2 but against 9th place. Dropping a Map is just bad
[4:27:01] mujarshad: and they ended up having to juggle many people this split
[4:27:05] WisperwindTFT: I doubt that any region is better this split
[4:27:14] goblinguy01: 2-0 low tier team or its an upset SKT
[4:27:24] scottoflorida2014: @goblibguy01 Yeah, SKT will still win the series but it's nice to see BBQ win
[4:27:25] WisperwindTFT: in all honesty quality didnt improve in any region
[4:27:35] halloderbaer: at worlds SKT and KT will step up. The telecom wars have been insane this year
[4:27:38] michaelsund: This is the weakest KR has ever been DogFace
[4:27:47] goblinguy01: @scottofl2014 It's not about BBQ losing. It's the fact, they dropped a map to BBQ
[4:27:50] cavalRy7: This match doesnt matter for SKT why should they tryhard their standing will not change
[4:27:51] mujarshad: i dunno, if skt throws early game again, maybe bbq won't throw
[4:28:11] mujarshad: cause their fans are going nuts right now
[4:28:17] goblinguy01: There is pride in LCK :P
[4:28:27] mujarshad: and they are not happy with their performance
[4:28:27] HADFlELD: Reminder that Suning beat Royal

[4:28:37] goblinguy01: I'm not even a SKT fan. I'm just making an observation based on ranks
[4:28:49] goblinguy01: It's like WE losing to Imay or Snake
[4:28:49] stirefy: bbq just gifted skt the win

[4:29:09] scottoflorida2014: Snakes year to dominate
[4:29:12] WisperwindTFT: mostly only fans because they win
[4:29:27] WisperwindTFT: will go away as soon as they are middle of the pack
[4:29:31] chrisrox22: WE > SSG > TSM > FNC
[4:29:32] stirefy: this match is kinda important to see how good skt is beofre playoffs
[4:29:35] michaelsund: So are Edg fans Tsm fans Fnc fans and Fw fans Kappa
[4:29:39] goblinguy01: 1st place should not lose to 10th Place
[4:29:42] uziko_: Jesus why is cho gath so big
[4:29:46] stirefy: they'll have to beat so many teams
[4:29:46] WisperwindTFT: yes

[4:31:55] Berserk72: imagine LZ after they were sold winning
[4:32:12] scottoflorida2014: LZ looks so good, when they are good. and then so bad when they are bad
[4:32:19] stirefy: i have a bad feeling about longzhu
[4:32:20] Berserk72: would the LZ ownership group try to buy it back?
[4:32:25] WisperwindTFT: I like NV
[4:32:26] stirefy: i hope they beat ssg today
[4:32:34] WisperwindTFT: and MSF
[4:32:48] scottoflorida2014: IF it has to be a KT, Hope it's KT and not SKT
[4:32:51] thedrfaust: I think LZ will be the Korean team that didn't make world this year
[4:33:04] Berserk72: it would be like the GSW being sold after the finals victory
[4:33:14] AmissFate: lul
[4:33:19] WisperwindTFT: if korea wins at worlds

[4:33:30] Berserk72: when
[4:33:37] cavalRy7: This game ResidentSleeper
[4:33:40] rofflepie: its actually very hard for LZ to make worlds if they dont win this split, even if they get 2nd they'll start quite far back in the gauntlet
[4:33:41] scottoflorida2014: I wondered what happens to IMT since one of the owners just died, if there would be some shakeup
[4:33:44] stirefy: poor Score man

[4:35:53] DoctorMansteel: bengi is a god in certain metas and a potato in others
[4:36:08] goblinguy01: That means he is inconsistent
[4:36:09] scottoflorida2014: Tempo Storm is the team to beat next year when they finally make it to LCS
[4:36:13] stirefy: Bengi hasn't been outstanding since s3
[4:36:15] goblinguy01: Good Junglers adapt
[4:36:27] michaelsund: @scottofl2014 but they lost MingLee
[4:36:42] scottoflorida2014: yeah it was rigged
[4:36:46] halloderbaer: Tempo Storm - the hots team?
[4:36:47] goblinguy01: Did Madlife or Dandy make it LCS?
[4:36:49] Gwerf: warmogs PogChamp
[4:36:50] WisperwindTFT: @DoctorMansteel exactly
[4:36:52] scottoflorida2014: :)
[4:36:54] FoilsArt_: 4k 5k???
[4:36:57] michaelsund: Team will probably disband
[4:37:00] uziko_: How is cho going to die
[4:37:11] DoctorMansteel: bengi incredibly inconsistent, only won 3 out of 6 worlds
[4:37:11] rofflepie: LCS doesnt have promotion anymore, next split is just selling spots
[4:37:16] scottoflorida2014: TS has a LOL team now
[4:37:18] cavalRy7: China is my city
[4:37:23] FoilsArt_: 6k?
[4:37:38] chrisrox22: TS will buy an lcs spot for 10m
[4:37:50] stirefy: Bengi wasn't even the starter in s6 lmao
[4:37:55] YourH1GHness: Why is this so boring to watch
[4:37:56] goblinguy01: Can we get another LMQ?
[4:37:59] michaelsund: Who backs Ts financially?
[4:38:04] rofflepie: there are more than 10 teams that re willing to pay, TS is not likely to get a spot
[4:38:19] DoctorMansteel: @stirefy go watch those last 2 bo5's and tell me which jungler won and which lost and in what order
[4:38:27] DoctorMansteel: at worlds
[4:38:40] stirefy: xd
[4:38:44] scottoflorida2014: Reynad owns TS but he has to have some silent partners with money
[4:38:47] stirefy: 2 b05 tells shit
[4:38:54] stirefy: he was garbage the whole year
[4:38:57] DoctorMansteel: semifinal and finals at worlds?
[4:39:02] DoctorMansteel: yeah that means shit
[4:39:07] stirefy: ye
[4:39:11] stirefy: he was cluth
[4:39:14] michaelsund: Misfits has more chance to get a spot tbh
[4:39:29] stirefy: but he was in the bench for all s6
[4:39:39] rofflepie: ther are about 6 spots in NA LCS thats locked, only about 4 for sell
[4:40:29] halloderbaer: interesting game ResidentSleeper
[4:40:30] rofflepie: CLG TSM TL IMT c9 DIG are all pretty much locked as long as they pay the 10mil
[4:40:52] BTLheal: I thought EF were pretty close to being locked too?
[4:41:05] rofflepie: EF has bad blood with rest of league
[4:41:10] halloderbaer: KappaPride
[4:41:16] rofflepie: i can easily see them not get a spot
[4:41:17] SlugSnipest: KappaPride
[4:41:20] FoilsArt_: Best Casters
[4:41:20] uziko_: i got a pic with the big banana
[4:41:22] DoctorMansteel: @stirefy bengi played 31 games for skt not counting international events that year
[4:41:22] BTLheal: yeah but they're pretty tight with riot?
[4:41:43] stirefy: 31 games is like 30 %
[4:41:48] stirefy: of the games they played
[4:42:04] rofflepie: if EF gets a spot then there is pretty much no chance for someone like TS to get a spot, consider the remaining NA LCS will also bid, also the 4 EU teams
[4:42:06] BloodbrotherHS: Big Cho eaten WutFace
[4:42:15] scottoflorida2014: Esports, if it keeps going the way it's going, they will have to start charging people to watch
[4:42:17] uziko_: Tahm has a pretty big mouth to eat that
[4:42:20] DoctorMansteel: 9 weeks 2 series a week
[4:42:24] stirefy: DanDy was carrying vici and when they swapped him for Bengi they got relegated
[4:42:32] DoctorMansteel: 54 possible games every game going 3 series
[4:42:36] BTLheal: well EF getting a spot would be due to their good relationship with riot, not due to their performance in the league
[4:42:56] f532253947: aram ResidentSleeper
[4:42:59] stirefy: because DanDy was truly a champion
[4:43:06] rofflepie: I didnt mention performance at all, if that mattered then TL is gone
[4:43:09] BTLheal: a relationship, afaik, teams like NV doesnt have, also there's a good chance NA LCS expands by atleast 2 spots, possibly 4
[4:43:11] DoctorMansteel: so at the least amopunt he played 57%
[4:43:23] uziko_: WIll this game ever end ResidentSleeper
[4:43:33] stirefy: what do you mean
[4:43:35] rofflepie: the 6 I mentioned has long history in NA, strong organization, and money to pay the 10 mil fee
[4:43:41] stirefy: 18 multiplied by 6
[4:43:45] edgelordweeb: I hope NV sticks around, they seem to be a pretty decent org
[4:43:51] stirefy: ain't 54
[4:43:58] DoctorMansteel: there re 9 weeks in lck season why 18?
[4:44:00] stirefy: your math are incorrect
[4:44:07] stirefy: two splits
[4:44:13] stirefy: per split
[4:44:17] DoctorMansteel: that was spring
[4:44:18] yaaz000: cho gath is playing so bad
[4:44:19] stirefy: 3 games max per series
[4:44:31] stirefy: i'm talking about s6 not spring

[4:47:14] DoctorMansteel: hate that shit

[4:47:34] yaaz000: kog has no flash. if they fight now they lose
[4:48:04] yaaz000: LGD is just outplayign SNG so hard. SNG should win all teamfights 100% with that teamcomp
[4:48:07] smassaboy: He was exhausted
[4:48:36] rofflepie: LGD dont even have exhanst
[4:48:42] rofflepie: FailFish
[4:49:09] smassaboy: Good! Kappa

[4:49:30] yaaz000: yeah tahm is playing reallly bad
[4:49:31] rofflepie: coulda killed renek and syndra with 1-2 more hits
[4:49:48] yaaz000: he even devours full hp chogath n shit for no reason
[4:50:07] yaaz000: fury needs flash or they will have a hard time
[4:51:38] f532253947: is this the 4th baronÔºü ResidentSleeper
[4:51:49] uziko_: Imagine playing a 60 minute game of league just to lose

[5:35:35] BTLheal: felt like bana couldve tped there
[5:35:41] BTLheal: with eimy coming down too
[5:35:42] Vashnaroth: Has been for quite a while @Hanzo_hasashi191512 , began as a Ori counterpick
[5:36:01] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: since xiye solo killed faker twice as lucian against ori
[5:36:12] rofflepie: it acutally started way before MSI
[5:36:18] rofflepie: watch spring LPL
[5:36:37] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: xiaohu was the first person to use it i think
