[0:02:23] OneHandyAndy: there we go
[0:02:39] zewm: oh god, another year before it starts
[0:02:40] YuriSwine: Tweeting frosk would have been funny seeing her reaction when she reads it
[0:02:47] OneHandyAndy: 1 hr early 4Head
[0:02:51] zewm: why is lpl later than lck?
[0:03:14] zewm: @NotDestru HeyGuys

[0:06:10] chrysopelea: LUL
[0:06:28] YuriSwine: ESL_LOL is better then SpotTV
[0:06:37] YuriSwine: *SpoTv
[0:06:42] chrysopelea: ESL is cancer
[0:06:53] YuriSwine: Yet still better then Spo
[0:07:17] chrysopelea: ye
[0:07:42] chrysopelea: I don't think switching LS with dumbzz helped the prograst
[0:07:51] chrysopelea: might have even downgraded it
[0:08:00] YuriSwine: I think it did. Getting rid of LS is ALWAYS a good idea
[0:08:10] mlgalanturing: LS was the worst
[0:08:17] YuriSwine: is
[0:08:53] chrysopelea: his team tempo storm didn't do well for NACS LUL
[0:09:15] zewm: I much prefer Rengfo
[0:09:32] 300_SPARTANZ: is this playoffs?
[0:09:35] zewm: LS just has a very annoying voice
[0:09:36] chrysopelea: probably told to em to act like koreans and proceed to do nothing
[0:09:48] YuriSwine: No LPL is still 3 weeks iirc from playoffs and regionals
[0:09:53] zewm: Crumbz has that sexy ASMR voice Kreygasm
[0:10:19] 300_SPARTANZ: damn 3 weeks so late
[0:10:42] YuriSwine: They have a 2-3 week break for new year
[0:10:51] chrysopelea: its better that it was in the past i think
[0:11:04] chrysopelea: they were really cutting it close to worlds before
[0:11:34] YuriSwine: I mean they will be again
[0:11:40] YuriSwine: worlds is...40 days?
[0:12:08] YuriSwine: No not even close
[0:12:23] YuriSwine: Doinb still got a chance though :D :D
[0:12:37] chrysopelea: being third seed kinda sucks lol
[0:12:55] chrysopelea: finish regionals then off to worlds
[0:13:55] chrysopelea: when the main group starts everybody pretty much knows your strats (If you make it to group ofc)
[0:14:43] YuriSwine: NB and OMG need to win to keep JDG chances good and strong.
[0:15:01] YuriSwine: As much as I do not want to root for NB...like i realllllllyyyyy do not want to root for them
[0:15:36] chrysopelea: Vasilli will break your neck kid, you better support NB
[0:16:16] YuriSwine: Nah fam I am hard on the Doinb train.
[0:17:01] zewm: this sounds like megaman
[0:17:41] YuriSwine: Anyone else think the new Brand skin looks like Hero Killer Stain?

[0:21:24] Wizzy1223: lol seriously
[0:21:38] Hi_ImPhantomere: I would be surprised if TSM even gave up a kill or an objective at worlds this year
[0:21:46] khriz0571: can someone ban @Hi_ImPhantomere ? lol
[0:21:49] goblinguy01: Who has watched Ti7? China is crushing those nerds?

[0:23:02] 300_SPARTANZ: Ti Bo1 top 16 lmao
[0:23:06] Hi_ImPhantomere: let's not forget TSM smashed SKT in scrims, so u can expect them to smash SKT at worlds this year
[0:23:07] goblinguy01: China Numbah One in Ti7
[0:23:28] goblinguy01: You can smash SKT in 59 scrims and it means nothing
[0:23:41] goblinguy01: Asian teams like to practice on stage
[0:23:51] 300_SPARTANZ: who da hell goes best of one past groupstage ffs
[0:23:55] Hi_ImPhantomere: @goblibguy01 TSM gonna breeze through worlds just like how they breezed through rift rivals, just wait and see

[0:28:40] goblinguy01: Why does DL lose to his fellow Chinese at every international event?
[0:28:41] mussjznedsein: it is you genius
[0:28:48] chrysopelea: anybody remember TSM vs RNG last year? DL betrayed NA
[0:28:51] goblinguy01: He always loses to Uzi Hmm Keepo

[0:45:41] chrysopelea: I feel like it does hold them back though
[0:45:59] goblinguy01: How did Rookie, Ray and the Korean who know Mandarin speak it so well

[0:52:48] hanafinit: who wins lgd or nb
[0:53:16] goblinguy01: Once Piglets goes back to Korea, you know they are running out of talent
[0:53:55] goblinguy01: Poor Mickey and Lira stuck in Na prison
[0:54:21] goblinguy01: Can they replace RO with Lira and get a better adc than Piglet
[0:55:12] Gebius: stuck in NA prison means good money . players go there for a reason
[0:55:16] Mikeboy63: and the shotcaller
[0:55:35] goblinguy01: Do you think Lira will stay in Na?
[0:55:38] chrysopelea: maybe Piglet is paying steve (Not Paid by Steve)
[0:55:44] Warwizard23: It looks like LCK pros always leave Korea because theres a better chance for them to make, compete, and win Worlds outside of their?

She cant make a hype like for example quickshot can, she doesnt have a good banter like phreak, krepo (rip) or deficio and her analysis seems to be presented in super boring way and that comes from me that loves all theorycrafting.
