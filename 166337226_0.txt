[2:18:46] EdDiliciousVN: for who ?
[2:18:49] Dat_Newt: WutFace
[2:18:50] kahanii: @sweboy123 it's because of ardent censer
[2:18:51] Badacems: 👌
[2:18:52] Koti1488: Uzi did cleanse
[2:18:53] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: @sweboy123 No, it's the LPL meta cuz they are really bad.
[2:18:54] Ripulpos: nb win game 1
[2:18:57] Never_Mist: @Krum_95 how do you talk like a white guy, hes talking like a professional
[2:18:58] dtoaster58: nb 1 - 0
[2:19:12] Baltmoree: @sweboy123 and if they have tons of CC it's a lot worth it to have a cleanse
[2:19:13] 그렘린1201: im in love with the coco TriHard
[2:19:22] dtoaster58: I think hes talking about the tone of his voice
[2:19:22] kahanii: @sweboy123 heal on support lets them trigger ardent
[2:19:24] sweboy123: hmm ok ty all
[2:19:40] Never_Mist: @Krum_95 you have to have a clean vocabulary to be a caster
[2:19:42] sweboy123: @kryptosciaa yeah but ardent isnt that op that its worth to take heal on supp
[2:19:47] shinamon345: technically its better because of cheap thornmail
[2:19:56] Baltmoree: @sweboy123 Also with cleanse as SS they'll save 1300gold for the QSS
[2:20:03] Never_Mist: @sweboy123 it actually works pretty well
[2:20:04] 그렘린1201: just dont bring back vasilli to newbee bruh
[2:20:12] Koti1488: @sweboy123 its counter-productive to play standard spells in s7
[2:20:12] kahanii: @sweboy123 ardent is rly OP lol, if they're not taking ardent then adc will take heal
[2:20:14] 그렘린1201: he is gonna ruin the chemistry Kappa
[2:20:30] maball54: im up baby
[2:20:43] luccid: TriHard West side \ TriHard >
[2:20:51] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: It would be a lot easier to take exhaust kill an immobile ADC FailFish
[2:20:52] maball54: ^^
[2:20:59] sweboy123: yes ardent is very good but i doubht their reasoning for taking heal on support is for ardent when both support have shields that will proc ardent on a 5 sec colldown compared to few minutes like heal lol
[2:21:02] trisssmerigold: FailFish these casters
[2:21:06] Never_Mist: lol
[2:21:08] bookjun: i read reddit vasilli had too much sex that ruined his skills?

[2:21:44] dtoaster58: @Bookjun so he took the eazy e route?
[2:22:08] Never_Mist: why does the LPL like short range adcs so much...
[2:22:11] Machrus: honestly why is he called bananafish
[2:22:14] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: @Baltmoree Actually she is really good because J4 and other engage champs are back in meta and her disengage is amazing. But lol.
[2:22:29] 厉害大王: Swift LUL
[2:22:33] 420juicelord69: i feel like barrier makes decent sense just because kog maw sits still and deals dps
[2:22:36] Koti1488: hopefully Skt 3-0 so i can watch RNG win
[2:22:48] 그렘린1201: because people in china like to eat fish with banana on the side Kappa
[2:23:11] Never_Mist: @jamesdd2147 that and 2 heals is pointless cause once you use one it applies healing reduction

[2:24:55] Machrus: i like it when they have western women names like Betty etc
[2:25:04] 그렘린1201: SNG paid by newbee ceo to throw hence that dive at mid MingLee
[2:25:05] Baltmoree: He took 2 tower shots, probably he was looking at the fight while clicking towards it

[2:25:49] Never_Mist: thats why
[2:25:49] Koti1488: @donnycha7 stay awake for chat hype

[2:31:28] Baltmoree: Max range knock up
[2:31:31] luccid: OH
[2:31:31] rudeoff: WTF
[2:31:36] trisssmerigold: @iSeverity i understand, just like bronze players confused why ppl would put ward on the map or in lane, plays really come as surprising when you pay 0 attention to minip or unware of any kill pressure
[2:31:38] luccid: CmonRaz
[2:31:42] scribbin_: PogChamp
[2:31:43] Hagoo: Swift + Coco <3

[2:31:58] 厉害大王: surprise
[2:31:59] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: But people say that Madara was just playing with his food
[2:32:15] Never_Mist: @trisssmerigold it was a missplay on SNG saide and he was trying to figure out why they would give them free kills
[2:32:27] bilboblaze: @NarutoUzumaki__DATTEBAYO and madra was god mode ... with the power of all the tailed beasts look at kisama who was itachis equal
[2:32:28] Never_Mist: welp gg
[2:32:29] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: You would think that Madara is the strongest but the fact that Mighty guy could do it was pretty interesting
[2:32:45] AngieFoxtrot: FailFish

[2:33:08] trisssmerigold: @iSeverity totally , they just dived for no reason , cho also jsut walked down for no reason and gave kill to tower
[2:33:11] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: True Kisame was disgustingly strong
[2:33:13] Shaidyn: NA game: 6 kills in 50 minutes. LPL game: 14 kills in 14 minutes.
[2:33:13] Hagoo: Now they fight without coco FailFish
[2:33:17] shinamon345: LPL pack with actions PogChamp

[2:33:27] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Samehade is one of the most broken outems in the game
[2:33:37] Baltmoree: I've herd about some clown fiestas, but this is next level, words can't describe this level of fiesta
[2:33:49] Never_Mist: like... what...
[2:33:52] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Those small things make Naruto so good
[2:33:58] Machrus: LPL isnt usually this much of a circus
[2:34:16] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: The fight where Kisame took on Killer Bee was just as good
[2:34:20] 420juicelord69: just last game everything was really slow
[2:34:21] taintzilla95: i beg to differ
[2:34:22] Never_Mist: @jasonparanoia no... no.. LCK > everyone else
[2:34:24] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: That fight was nasty
[2:34:28] Baltmoree: Never seen this much fiesta on the lpl
[2:34:36] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Kisame was best member of akatsuki

[2:34:50] holly_cow_bbq: NA EleGiggle Shortest Joke in Twich Chat EleGiggle
[2:34:58] Never_Mist: @Baltmoree what LPL is all fiesta they live in the Fiesta
[2:34:59] 그렘린1201: rofl
[2:35:03] 420juicelord69: this shit is a party cause lucian was trying to snowball
[2:35:08] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: wait which spider guy did neji fight?
[2:35:11] 그렘린1201: LPL boyz Keepo
[2:35:16] Hagoo: Why are they always forcing fights for no reason?
[2:35:18] MichaelToost: nice throw NB 4Head
[2:35:22] Hagoo: Without any vision?
[2:35:32] ShacoMyBrand: Bobby Heenan BibleThump
[2:35:35] Never_Mist: they arent even fighting over anything
[2:35:40] Baltmoree: @iSeverity at this level? THis game is bringing a whole new meaning to fiesta
[2:35:44] vanceencounter: i got ya
[2:35:48] shinamon345: chat doesn't realise its fiesta meta Kappa
[2:35:50] 그렘린1201: this feels more like watching solo Q than pro Keepo
[2:35:53] Never_Mist: just fighting jsut for the hell of it
[2:36:06] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: If we are talking about OG Gaara vs Rock Lee was better
[2:36:16] Baltmoree: Everyone is playing with the map covered, it's for the fun times!
[2:36:19] Hagoo: how do you mute weebs?
[2:36:25] Never_Mist: @Baltmoree i didnt say anything about level?
[2:36:26] AngieFoxtrot: reminds one of old QG and there fiestas
[2:36:34] 420juicelord69: trundle rushed adaptive? mmmk
[2:36:43] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Why would you want to mute weebs?
[2:36:50] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: What is wrong with Naruto
[2:36:56] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: I ll tell oyu
[2:36:59] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex becasue they can tell from the reaction that the enemy also have no vison of themselves and its a kill to push an advantage so they can win the game? as winnning the game is their objective and killing enemies helps that?
[2:37:01] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Its nothing
[2:37:02] Warwizard23: RlyTho
[2:37:03] 420juicelord69: oh wait cause kog nvm
[2:37:11] shinamon345: sakura in boruto is THICC
[2:37:19] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: That's what I've been saying, Naruto is edging into art category
[2:37:20] Never_Mist: @xHaguex click there name then the chat bubble
[2:37:36] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Wait what Sakura isn't thick
[2:37:43] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: You are thinking about Ino
[2:37:49] atsxo: is this an anime forum? watch the fucking game
[2:38:01] BREZZY: LUL
[2:38:01] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold But if you have no vision why go for the play? It's too risky and when you have a twitch you have so many opportunities there's no need to takee the first one you see everytime, plus there's no guarantee they'll get the objectives
[2:38:03] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex tho i understand you like the game where both team takes no risk or pushes no kill advantage and wait for 30 minutes pushing towers and waves like exactly in your games, mustbe entertaning tho
[2:38:09] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Wait I thought this was just a waiting room for LCK
[2:38:16] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: That is why I was talking about Naruto
[2:38:16] Never_Mist: @xHaguex who knows
[2:38:23] dtoaster58: 20 minutes
[2:38:25] Baltmoree: Waiting room for lck
[2:38:35] Baltmoree: Is the lck chat
[2:38:37] AngieFoxtrot: I've never even seen Naruto and intend to keep it that way
[2:38:42] Hagoo: Literally an LCK waiting room LUL
[2:38:43] Never_Mist: @xHaguex most LPL teams dont fight over vission or objectives they fight just for the gold
[2:38:51] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Why would you deprive yourself of Naruto?
[2:38:58] 삼도천심해어: DBS > oneshit > Borushit Kappa
[2:39:07] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: It can help you in yuor classes in school
[2:39:10] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex who is it risky? you ever played twitch? maybe you think its right to just ignore that ult and kayn's wall walk ability and push waves for 30 minutes? it must be youre kind of game
[2:39:12] bilboblaze: naruto is better than sex
[2:39:14] chrysopelea: Naruto stole my childhood FeelsBadMan
[2:39:19] hugh_jes: weebs haHAA
[2:39:27] AngieFoxtrot: lol school
[2:39:28] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Dude please dont compare Naruto to DBZ or One Piece, those shows are trash
[2:39:36] shinamon345: Thats how LPL beat Korean team LCK in RR LCK couldn't keep up the tempo
[2:39:37] hugh_jes: naruto haHAA
[2:39:44] Baltmoree: If you don't want fillers, read the manga, shippuden is 50% fillers
[2:39:50] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: yes shippuden is better than OG if you ignore the fillers imo
[2:39:52] KKona_KKona_KKona_KKona1: naruto DansGame
[2:39:53] hugh_jes: sit and spit Jebaited
[2:39:58] Never_Mist: @shinamon345 LCK not used to the Fiesta lol true
[2:39:59] bilboblaze: @johnson383 yeah just good a cannon epsisode list it will give u just the important ones
[2:40:04] scottoflorida2014: You plebs trying to carry on a serious conversation on Twitch LUL BrokeBack
[2:40:08] bookjun: fuck newbee pls end it LCK is coming
[2:40:11] bilboblaze: @johnson383 google*
[2:40:18] 厉害大王: 2-0 PLZ
[2:40:19] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold lmao i'm not saying that you can't do that, but there's so many more opportunities, roam mid and kill lucian and it's a guaranteed free turret, with drake dead roam top get herald and top tower, there's just so many better choices than rushing botlane and engaging every second
[2:40:26] holly_cow_bbq: Where are all the Plebs Now Typing TSM are on The same lvl as SKT? SKT really sux EleGiggle
[2:40:27] chrysopelea: anybody taking bo1's seriously and with LCK having MVP on their team LUL
[2:40:30] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: But dont read hthe manga for Boruto
[2:40:32] bilboblaze: hate us cause they anus
[2:40:35] chrysopelea: lets be real that RR had a terrible format
[2:40:48] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex and how in the fk world is the kill they're trying to take not one of these opportinues you talking about????
[2:40:50] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Kishimoto's vision is in the animation of Boruto not the manga
[2:40:56] UnderCwarrior: Puri-puri prisoner is best naruto character
[2:41:08] hugh_jes: SKT honestly on the same level as G2 right now SoBayed
[2:41:11] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: puri puri prisoner?
[2:41:14] scottoflorida2014: @holly_cow_bbq I think everyone accepts the fact that TSM will win Worlds so there's no sense in repeating it anymore
[2:41:15] shinamon345: bo1 is a terrible format LUL so we should play half a game now? LUL
[2:41:22] T0NELOCO: 6-9
[2:41:27] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: I don't think that is a character in Naruto
[2:41:29] bilboblaze: @NarutoUzumaki__DATTEBAYO tokyo ghoul is the best anime of all time
[2:41:37] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Hell no
[2:41:41] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold it's an opportunity but it's a shit one, the best they can get is a tier 1 non fb outer turret, and they've done it before so the jungler is likely expecting it and in that case can easily turn it if they force it too hard
[2:41:55] chrysopelea: Avatar the last airbender is my favorite anime Kappa
[2:41:57] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Actually yes, because Naruto isn't technically anime, it is art
[2:42:03] hugh_jes: haHAA anime talk haHAA naruto haHAA grown up men watching childrens cartoons all day haHAA
[2:42:05] BREZZY: Neither Naruto or Tokyo Ghoul are the best, the best is Boku no Pico
[2:42:08] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Just like Deidara said
[2:42:21] Baltmoree: The best char in naruto is Ichiraku, master of the Lamen Jutsu
[2:42:26] Shaidyn: Boku no Pico? What's that? Should I watch it?
[2:42:27] bilboblaze: hate us cause they anus
[2:42:29] BREZZY: LUL
[2:42:30] stoolio: Cowboy Bebop?
[2:42:32] bilboblaze: no
[2:42:36] hugh_jes: haHAA can we stop talking about anime haHAA
[2:42:42] BREZZY: Bro I like Sasori fight me
[2:42:42] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: No don't watch it
[2:42:43] bilboblaze: nooo
[2:42:44] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex no it was an opportunity for a kill, they saw it and they take it, how is it a shit one???
[2:42:52] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Deidara > Sasori
[2:42:56] BREZZY: hmmm

[2:43:09] no_fly_zone7: lmao cho how you keep fukin that up
[2:43:13] Baltmoree: A justin bieber fan is complaining about anime talking, what's happening to the world?
[2:43:15] 厉害大王: wtf
[2:43:17] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Sasori doesn't have the balls to be in Akatsuki
[2:43:28] bilboblaze: sasori sucks
[2:43:35] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold because the chance of actually getting the kill is low, and like i said there's better opportunities where the reward from the kill is much greater, tbh you're probaly like silver and never gonna get it
[2:43:35] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Deidara has the attitude and style of someone who belongs in Akatsuki
[2:43:40] atsxo: raz sucks no way around it
[2:43:45] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Sasori acts like a little girl
[2:43:57] atsxo: holy shit mods purge this chat
[2:44:06] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Did you see Deidara when he was revived with Edo Tensei?
[2:44:08] hugh_jes: haHAA weeb chat haHAA
[2:44:13] scottoflorida2014: I wonder if LPL will ever be able to play at LCK levels one day
[2:44:19] ebuCCC: Weebs WutFace
[2:44:20] Hagoo: When you've muted the weeb Kreygasm
[2:44:27] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex and youre reaosn for it is they can raom mid kill lucian and push mid??? you mentally challenged? how is "killing lucian in the mid and push tower" a better one? and u do freaking realize its also a "kill" in the mid????
[2:44:34] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: The guy was still trying to blow shit up during Edo Tensei
[2:44:38] hugh_jes: haHAA let me tell you about my fav naruto character guyse haHAA
[2:44:47] Warwizard23: wouldnt be suprised to see LGD lose later. I do want to catch RPG vs DFM
[2:44:53] bilboblaze: @mmc2344 naw tried watching all the way to where they fight the clown it gave me cancer
[2:44:56] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: i mean Deidara still isn't my favorite character
[2:45:05] MichaelToost: noob NB
[2:45:06] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: I was just saying that to compare to Sasori
[2:45:15] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Do you want to know my favorite character?
[2:45:15] hugh_jes: @NarutoUzumaki__DATTEBAYO CoolStoryBob
[2:45:24] hugh_jes: CoolStoryBob tell me more
[2:45:27] bilboblaze: no
[2:45:27] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: I'll tell you anyway
[2:45:28] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold Because getting mid tower opens up the whole map? This is common knowledge? With no mid they can easily push into any side of the jungle and create vision, you saw that TP flank in the previous fight where cho teleported behind? Only possible because they had mid turret
[2:45:30] Baltmoree: Who can it be?
[2:45:35] ebuCCC: Weebs all wear fedoras WutFace
[2:45:37] hugh_jes: CoolStoryBob tell us
[2:45:48] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: My favorite character is Kisame
[2:45:52] BREZZY: Why
[2:45:54] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex OFC are you retarded, how about they just all go mid kill everyone and push nexus???? why arent they doing that?????
[2:45:55] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: That dude is baller asf

[2:46:17] Baltmoree: My favorite pokemon from naruto is Agumon
[2:46:27] bilboblaze: kisama sucksssss
[2:46:32] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: That scene where he transforms into a shark against Killer Bee was LIT
[2:46:42] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: How does Kisame suck?
[2:46:44] hugh_jes: CoolStoryBob any other anime characters you can identify with? CoolStoryBob
[2:46:51] scottoflorida2014: Silly PLebs grossGJ
[2:46:58] shinamon345: ANYONE HERE WATCH KIZUNA AI
[2:47:01] potatozrgud: @justinbiebsfan98 grimer because I am trash
[2:47:01] Hagoo: @LPL1 Yeah resorting to baseless arguments instead of actually pointing out where i said something wrong, no point arguing further
[2:47:02] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Well I I do have another one
[2:47:08] bilboblaze: because he loses to a guy with no justsu
[2:47:35] bilboblaze: yes
[2:47:36] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Dude Mighty Guy fucking murked Madara
[2:47:45] yaaz000: newbee or sng win?
[2:47:46] potatozrgud: Wonder if you'll get banned for posting the madara uchiha copypasta
[2:47:56] BREZZY: do it
[2:47:57] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: It is expected he has a tough matchup into Kisame as well
[2:47:59] Baltmoree: You wanna make the mods appear? Talk shit about Frosk, you'll get a time out almost instantly
[2:47:59] calcil: where the fuck is my boy fury?
[2:48:11] bilboblaze: naruto turns into a god
[2:48:25] 삼도천심해어: haHAA naruto haHAA
[2:48:32] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex your argument for they shouldnt go bot to try get that kill is that they can raom mid kill Lucian and get mid, i ask how is it better, you said becasue open mid is important,and without mid they can....
[2:48:37] Baltmoree: @mmc2344 Frosk is the female caster for lpl
[2:48:43] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Either way if I had to choose another it is probably Sasuke
[2:48:49] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: He is just as baller
[2:48:51] bilboblaze: then theres this one guys whos actually talking about lol xD

[2:49:30] bilboblaze: sasuke loses his arm he trash
[2:49:31] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: And he still had one arm and took on a member ofthe Otsutsuki
[2:49:39] Hagoo: @jamesdd2147 kog has 3 items, we won't see how effective it is until a full teamfight
[2:49:48] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Dude even with one arm he is just as strong
[2:49:51] bilboblaze: ^^
[2:49:58] shinamon345: sasuke is just a edgelord
[2:50:01] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: He could have gotten his arm back, he just didnt want to
[2:50:08] bilboblaze: cant weav hand signs but yes
[2:50:16] Baltmoree: Sasuke was cooler when we didn't know where he was and he never appeared
[2:50:21] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: He doesn't need it
[2:50:28] bilboblaze: yeah exactly some bs bleach lookin ass stuff
[2:50:29] aimanicose: i'm sure orochimaru could've figured something out
[2:50:38] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Once you have that much control of chakra u dont need hand signals
[2:50:51] 삼도천심해어: haHAA sasuke edgelord haHAA
[2:50:54] potatozrgud: One armed dude classic anime trope
[2:50:56] 420juicelord69: @xhaguex why force a dive onto lucian anyway? he's much more mobile and strong early. Kog was not
[2:50:56] aimanicose: I liked shippuden up to Pain's battle
[2:51:01] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: They only had like 3 occurences of that dude
[2:51:16] 卄口长卂厶乇_𠘨卂尺凵丅口: Besides it is because Itachi's sharingan is busted
[2:51:31] Sonicfields: CHOGATH LUL
[2:51:37] Hagoo: @jamesdd2147 lucian was always pushed up from what I saw, with a twitch you can get behind him and then he can't possibly escape, no dive needed
[2:51:39] potatozrgud: Ff to 50 mins pls
[2:51:41] shinamon345: sharingan are just bunch of hax
[2:51:45] kahanii: someone win this game in the next 10 min so we can go to lck Kappa

[2:53:04] 420juicelord69: @xhaguex that was just another reason why they maybe took the fight bot
[2:53:13] potatozrgud: Put this game out of its misery
[2:53:48] mattyhoh: a fix fest? LUL get this troll outta here
[2:54:05] potatozrgud: If SN don't finish it off and drag it out another 15 mins just end me
[2:54:15] Hagoo: @jamesdd2147 yeah but that's why i'm saying, they had a huge advantage from some good kills bot early on but then they never translated it, they didn't get first blood turret, took them ages to get bot
[2:54:53] zafit45: Someone here who could get me from plat 3 to diamond 5 on euw whisper me pls

[2:56:23] potatozrgud: Gwin soo EleGiggle DansGame
[2:56:23] 420juicelord69: @xhaguex the main thing i was trying to say is kog scales hard, obviously they fucked up already by not having more of a lead at 30 min but The last thing you wanna do against kog is leave him a free lane to farm
[2:56:28] yaaz000: lwx,coco needs to play reallly well to be able to win or cho gath can solo carry
[2:56:28] 삼도천심해어: no more naruto talk Kreygasm Kappa

[2:57:13] yaaz000: kogmaw should win now xd
[2:57:26] shinamon345: tank kog PogChamp
[2:57:36] Ryan_TheLegend: does kog have stormraiders?
[2:57:43] yaaz000: warlord i think
[2:57:50] Ryan_TheLegend: hmm
[2:57:56] trisssmerigold: @jamesdd2147 its no use, @xHaguex has the genius strategy of all go mid kill lucian and push tower, nothing beasts that insightful glorious strategy
[2:58:00] yaaz000: ppl go warlord for the better laning
[2:58:05] Hagoo: @jamesdd2147 yeah obviously they don't wanna let kog free farm, but twitch scales can scale hard as well and the advantage they can get elsewhere should be able to beat out kog freefarming, but then again who knows it's 40 minutes into the game, but not every game vs kog is won against him by pushing bot
[2:58:31] Ryan_TheLegend: who are top 3 teams rn?
[2:58:35] yaaz000: the problem is their frontline at 40mins
[2:58:52] yaaz000: kogmaw will just melt them
[2:59:01] yaaz000: twitch is better vs squishies than kog . But kog melts tanks
[2:59:10] trisssmerigold: oh also for the great genius @xHaguex all kill attempts are stupid cause why do that when you can just go mid and kill lucian and take mid tower??? duh
[2:59:11] crdto: Randuins on lucian now too lol
[2:59:37] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold speaking sarcastically doesn't mean i was wrong LUL

[3:00:29] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex how can a genius like you be wrong when you understand the importance of MID tower and the great strategy of "just roam mid and kill lucian and take mid tower"??

[3:01:31] 厉害大王: TAIWAN NUMBA WAN
[3:01:36] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold this game could've been 15 minutes shorter if they took proper advantages, heck even higher up lpl teams will take these chances that's why they're at the top and newbee with a pretty good lineup isn't
[3:03:15] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex whatever you say master? i think they chould have won in 5 especially when they took your glorious strategy of "go mid kill lucian and take mid tower" all their other plays and attemps just seem futile after hearing hit glorious strategy of yours, guess they should invite you to be coach instead of some challenger analyzing thegame 24/7
[3:03:38] Never_Mist: @xHaguex just give up he will only see what he wants to see you wont chang ehis mind
[3:04:16] Hagoo: @iSeverity Yeah I know, at least with the other dude it's actually putting up arguments, not just getting triggered over twitch chat
[3:04:56] Never_Mist: @xHaguex they wont understand that these arent macro games
[3:05:23] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex how can i argue against you , when youre aguemeng against their trying to take a kill at bot is that they should "roam mid kill lucian and take mid" and whn i ask how its better you give me the glrious insight of the importance of mid tower
[3:05:24] mbergman22: I have icecream, I win
[3:05:32] 삼도천심해어: haHAA argument in twitch chat haHAA
[3:06:19] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex every gaem is so simple after jearomg your genius stragety of kill their mid and take mid tower,
[3:06:46] Hagoo: NB won again
[3:06:56] trisssmerigold: @xHaguex i mean why even bother trying to risk kill at bot when you can just kill their mid and take mid twoer? right? i just feel enlightend,
[3:07:09] Never_Mist: @trisssmerigold he just means the arent fighting over objectives or Vision they are just fighting just for the gold
[3:07:35] Hagoo: @trisssmerigold mid, top, or rift herald, any of those are available but bot every time, i'm going to watch lck lovely calm discussion HeyGuys
[3:08:13] trisssmerigold: excatly ,when every objective on the map is there for you to take, why even bother trying to kill right??

[3:59:25] goblinguy01: I think China Numbah Oneb
[3:59:29] Espen115: i think forever young are favorites but its a close match
[3:59:29] michaelsund: TL without Mickey and Dardoch would lose
[3:59:30] xGazzLoL: TL win after wasting 5 milions
[3:59:31] WhoKnowsUA: @wasuhh that's fine bcs he have huge frontlane. Corki and Varus had to deal with Cho J4 first while Vayne can kill much faster any target in the map already
[3:59:33] goblinguy01: Taiwan Numbah Four
[3:59:55] ShacoMyBrand: TL beating both LGD teams would be quite comedic
[4:00:20] yaaz000: maokai flash w,alistar w,q on vayne ,corki autos once
[4:00:35] yaaz000: LGD team comp is to much skill reliant

[4:00:50] 삼도천심해어: i worry about TL draft though BrokeBack
[4:00:57] goblinguy01: Dota 2 is owned by Americans lol
[4:01:21] michaelsund: And they are still trash at the game LUL reminds me of league
[4:01:30] WhoKnowsUA: @wasuhh vayne acutally are the best adc to deal with Alistar bcs his ult doesn't work vs true damage
[4:01:56] yaaz000: They have way to much cc vs vayne. He has to play mechanicaly super well to win
[4:02:14] Eliezer992: rerum?
[4:02:16] yaaz000: rapidfire,shiv corki can easily poke vayne
[4:02:43] WhoKnowsUA: @wasuhh well again only corki can follow their engage others have no damage basically full tanks

[4:03:45] goblinguy01: It wasn't anyone specific
[4:03:51] yaaz000: yeah lgd's teamcomp didn't make sense
[4:04:00] ShacoMyBrand: I wasn't a question of scaling, LGD just played bad
[4:04:00] yaaz000: it was all about getting an early lead
[4:04:12] goblinguy01: You can't blame Cool or Eimy. Why did Imp pick Vayne
