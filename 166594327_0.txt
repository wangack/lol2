[4:10:46] Beetrayn: </3
[4:10:49] goblinguy01: I mean U barely fed. In S5 quarter finals before MSI. You can't blame U for them losing 2 matches, it was the entire team playing like apes
[4:11:19] cutiecat88: u can have a role player mid if your jungle and top laner are playmakers
[4:11:29] Exastick: @Cutiecat88 Pawn's not really a role player. He can be a lower resource requiring player, but even then he uses more resources.
[4:11:40] goblinguy01: Deft only had 3 good games the entire series, Clearlove played bad in their loses and Koro did nothing
[4:11:50] nezzqi: monkaS
[4:11:51] Lzhrsmile: zzz
[4:12:05] mujarshad: flash for cleanse SeemsGood

[4:12:10] nickstroeve: Deft PogChamp
[4:12:28] goblinguy01: I'd imagine EDG initial was to be WE 2.0, well you can take the entire World Elite team to EDG right?

[4:13:55] goblinguy01: I'm pretty sure you've seen this comparison. NaMei was the next WeiXaio, Meiko was hand picked by Fzzf, and no one could replace Misaya in China :P

[6:04:36] freeko: how would i send them to you @CasterFroskurinn ?
[6:04:41] Kazin_dabes: pause
[6:04:44] LokiCatAU: I can see the advantage of Cronobreak but i really hope they practice and bring the implementation time down :|
[6:04:46] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko I have a business email on my twitter
[6:04:46] sweboy123: @bladex09 aha ok ty did they do anyhting or was it just unpaused ?
[6:05:00] Usagiii0911: SOFM FIGHTING
[6:05:01] rainbowhouse: EDG so bad
[6:05:03] life_a1ert: Oh no I dced. Can we reset again?
[6:05:04] NeiLy: you can evaluate me any day
[6:05:06] CasterFroskurinn: I think the issue in this situation of Chronobreak is what time to return to in game.
[6:05:17] cantspeel: WE DID IT FAM
[6:05:23] NeiLy: is this still replay
[6:05:27] nichtDose: Mod PogChamp
[6:05:28] SkyTrax1989: Thisd feels like EDG won out alot on how they did it!
[6:05:31] bladex09: @sweboy123 they rewinded 1 min b4 baron
[6:05:36] TiesAU: it looked like it said iBoy - does this now open the "what is an iBoy champion" silliness :(
[6:05:37] mujarshad: no, this is live
[6:05:40] life_a1ert: Can someone make me some toast and bring me a water? Anyone?
[6:05:48] CasterFroskurinn: I will be right there
[6:05:49] SteveDGamer: so much bs
[6:05:50] sweboy123: @bladex09 aha !! thank you so much bladex !! :)
[6:05:53] bladex09: @sweboy123 which is crazy bc edg lowkey threw baron
[6:05:54] CasterFroskurinn: do you want butter?
[6:05:55] cantspeel: implementation wasnt chronobreaks fault. the server was unstable so chronobreak had trouble working correctly
[6:06:00] MichaelToost: Snake can win this?
[6:06:01] life_a1ert: Yes please. Fake butter
[6:06:05] rainbowhouse: disgusting team
[6:06:06] cantspeel: thanks for the patience everyone!
[6:06:06] freeko: does chronobreak allow for the teams to return to any previous point in the game? or does it have to rewind only a specific amoint like up to 3 minutes back perhaps?
[6:06:07] CasterFroskurinn: Fake. Butter
[6:06:10] LokiCatAU: It does seem a bit weird to determine the best time with the teams. Seems a ref of sorts could be making that call :o
[6:06:11] NeiLy: what a sweet gal
[6:06:15] life_a1ert: Lmfaooooooooo
[6:06:23] mujarshad: @Freeko any point
[6:06:28] Mechafanboy: Too bad Snake lost their pretty sizeable advantage. Oh well. Let's go Snake~
[6:06:28] NeiLy: its called margarine on planet earth
[6:06:31] life_a1ert: I had a chance!!!!!!
[6:06:41] CasterFroskurinn: It's called unhappiness on bread
[6:06:47] Kazin_dabes: i can't believe its not baron
[6:06:50] SkyTrax1989: this is so unfair..... to restart the game would have been more fair honestly!
[6:06:56] life_a1ert: Lmqooooooooo
[6:06:57] mujarshad: @Freeko it replays all inputs to the server, so it basically replays the game to any point you want
[6:07:07] life_a1ert: Poor bread :(
[6:07:11] Usagiii0911: SOFM FIGHTING <3
[6:07:22] LokiCatAU: whats the replay filesize of an hour game? :p
[6:07:24] freeko: both teams agreed to this point to restart at, so i dont see how it could possibly be unfair
[6:07:24] life_a1ert: I almost ruined breads life.
[6:07:34] NeiLy: did rusty choose his pink twitch name neily4Think
[6:07:38] Alohra: AR URF FeelsBadMan

[6:08:03] Shyvakuma: how do you read SofM? do you read it like S of M or S o f M
[6:08:05] NeiLy: I only wanna be with you?
[6:08:13] CasterFroskurinn: It's "Style of Me"

[6:09:17] Shyvakuma: surprise surprise
[6:09:24] Alohra: reddit 4Head
[6:09:27] CasterFroskurinn: We went to the Snake house and spoke to their manager and they were all playing PubG and he answered us and we were both shocked.

[6:09:50] LokiCatAU: everyone needs a pubg break!
[6:09:54] freeko: out of curiosity why does SofM not just use Style of Me for the summoner name compared to SofM that he uses now?
[6:09:57] CasterFroskurinn: Snake are HILARIOUS. They are a super funny team; their manager does the best impressions of people.
[6:10:01] Kazin_dabes: i feel like ive seen this before somewhere
[6:10:08] CasterFroskurinn: I'm not sure why he uses the abbreviation
[6:10:09] Shyvakuma: lul

[6:10:14] sweboy123: LUL
[6:10:15] NeiLy: whats maokais win rate
[6:10:35] Shyvakuma: dosn't S and M mean something different in chinese?
[6:10:35] CasterFroskurinn: Vincent told me they say "smiles" but they have a bunch of combinations or nicknames for the players
[6:10:43] bedza: stop screaming
[6:10:53] CasterFroskurinn: We talk a lot to the Chinese casters. Specifically Vincent and Remember.
[6:11:10] donglees: WTF
[6:11:12] Shyvakuma: :)))))
[6:11:18] dorin_: gg

[6:11:59] donglees: EleGiggle B)
[6:12:00] life_a1ert: Cold hearted casters. No big deal. Death to all I guess
[6:12:05] Shyvakuma: lulululul

[6:12:15] life_a1ert: I'm here to help rumble
[6:12:24] life_a1ert: I gave him a life alert neckless
[6:12:26] CasterFroskurinn: Yeah. I *** at him to post more AMAs
[6:12:28] NeiLy: too much innuendo in that one for my taste
[6:12:32] life_a1ert: That's what I'm here for people
[6:12:36] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn so do you normally talk in english if you were to have a casual conversation with him say, after a cast for example?
[6:13:01] Kazin_dabes: they actually draw pictures
[6:13:04] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko yeah. I'll we chat him during matches and after a lot. To ask why teams are doing certain things or if they can ask how players are doing
[6:13:05] Never_Mist: Clearlove is having a good game :D
[6:13:08] Mechafanboy: Well to be fair, EDG looked pretty comfortable before the Baron anyway... Now that they're playing a bit slower, guess Snake's done for this game :(
[6:13:11] SteveDGamer: i would personally shout at the casters for not letting ss have the baron
[6:13:55] mujarshad: I'm pretty sure clearlove dc'd cause he was just standing at the back of the pit not moving
[6:13:55] AoiiKitsune: Pretty sure CL lagged or DCed to allow SS to get the baron
[6:13:56] CasterFroskurinn: Snake can never catch a break. U N L U C K Y. :(
[6:14:04] crok0d1le: its really too bad snake got the worst dragon when you're losing
[6:14:25] MikeFrozt: rip in pepperoni snake
[6:14:29] NeiLy: i would disagree with that statement
[6:14:35] NeiLy: cloud is the worst in all scenarios
[6:14:43] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn will they disclose what the issue was that caused the game to go into chronobreak? I woke up and started watching pretty much during the pause but I never learned what caused the pause
[6:14:45] sweboy123: no cloud is good sometimes !!
[6:14:48] CasterFroskurinn: It'd help them rotate between their towers to protect it
[6:14:49] AoiiKitsune: @crok0d1le sarcasm or serious?
[6:14:56] EdDiliciousVN: cloud is good for rotating between turrets and 3rons or dragon
[6:15:00] Never_Mist: yea cloud is good depending on your comp
[6:15:02] melillensede: @CasterFroskurinn Hello :)
[6:15:06] Shyvakuma: dragons are good/bad depending on the game situation
[6:15:16] AoiiKitsune: wait don't snake have mountains? or are the graphics wrong
[6:15:18] NeiLy: still would rather have any other one for tower defense
[6:15:21] EdDiliciousVN: if ur comp has a sivir and a cloud, prepare to be bamboozled
[6:15:21] crok0d1le: @AoiiKitsune serious. mountain does nothing if enemy has objective control and you cant even seige
[6:15:22] Shyvakuma: but water and fire drake are always good
[6:15:25] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko let me ask
[6:15:32] NeiLy: i guess mountain is worse when turtling only but good for capitalizing
[6:15:43] SteveDGamer: gg snake now get those cheaters
[6:15:55] Never_Mist: @CasterFroskurinn btw you are my favorite caster ty for all the Very detailed information you give us and the cool Furs :D

[6:17:49] deadbrain00: Armor DansGame
[6:17:56] CasterFroskurinn: OPL is doing cool things by having pros cast a lot of games
[6:18:08] melillensede: @CasterFroskurinn Will you be there at Worlds or rather will we still see you casting this year?
[6:18:09] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn do the team managers and or coaches allow you access to the players during the "downtime" from league play to do interviews and the like?
[6:18:13] CasterFroskurinn: more so than any other region. So it's nice to have a really updated pro perspectiveon the game
[6:18:14] chrysopelea: OPL is good for some laughs

[6:20:22] sweboy123: cognisant PogChamp fancy
[6:20:26] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn ok, so it is more just asking a coach or manager about the choices that were made during a pick/ban phase. So you dont spend an off day from casting at like say the EDG house talking to those players, managers, or coaches?

[6:42:11] freeko: is EDG just freelo'ing this game?
[6:42:12] retusv: PogChamp
[6:42:18] CasterFroskurinn: @brentjonesau it'll be skewed because he's on the top team and EDG awlays win

[6:43:23] mujarshad: syndra?
[6:43:29] Never_Mist: knew it
[6:43:41] CasterFroskurinn: But he's 40/9 on reksai

[6:44:56] freeko: sprained wrist? maybe a broken finger from smashing a keyboard?
[6:44:59] CasterFroskurinn: Elise is Clearlove's lowest winnrate jungler on more than 10 games played.
[6:45:20] Mechafanboy: Maybe Edg wants to give them back a win for last game? ;P
[6:45:22] freeko: is EDG playing for game 3?
[6:45:22] ZNXF777: @casterfroskurinn what about fireloli :thinking:
[6:45:22] Marci_Unleashed: nice mid edg EleGiggle
[6:45:22] Never_Mist: i believe, he can change that :)
[6:45:26] Adminxoxo: snake got game2 easily, edgs draft is terrible
[6:45:28] bettor4k: who has better draft?
[6:45:28] Kazin_dabes: zet = shattered ego?
[6:45:42] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko I actually believe it's a conspiracy. That they don't want to offend Zet fans, so they say he's injured while they've been training to replace him for a while now. But this is all my conspiracy theory.
[6:46:01] yudai95: asian jensen?

[6:46:48] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn LPL players are under contract just like any other region, yes?

[6:47:27] LokiCatAU: iSeverity not sure it will help with sealed headphones :o
[6:47:28] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko Yes. But fans in china also have fanclubs of specific players. Uzi's being the largest. You don't want to damage the brand of your org to that players fanbase by benching them, so say he's injured
[6:47:29] Voysees: only 6000 ppl on lpl BibleThump
[6:48:00] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn I guess at the end of the season, if Zet is traded/dropped I know where we heard the info first.
[6:48:07] Shrekkles: hey frosk are we gonna see you casting worlds? :)
[6:48:09] NeiLy: casters drained by pause BibleThump

[6:48:19] Voysees: qt has 11000
[6:48:35] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko I think they retain Zet as a good backup and have iBpy and Zet developed together. Likewise he's a solid brand and player. EDG has a ton of players and multiple teams they train up
[6:48:39] SpikeJulia: Cos there is douyu tv，panda tv etc.
[6:48:47] SpikeJulia: are

[6:49:57] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn does LPL have any kind of challenger series like other regions do? Does EDG have a "minor league" team in that challenger series to develop players out of?
[6:50:04] CATGR1LL: Mouse FeelsBadMan

[6:50:17] PreacherCasts: @Freeko LSPL is what you're looking for. Raz is a huge proponent
[6:50:18] NeiLy: tops tilted from pause
[6:50:18] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko China has 4 leagues: LPL, LPPL, LSPL, and TGA
[6:50:22] TiesAU: china has/had two secondary leagues right?
[6:50:24] vectorla: CULL
[6:50:25] decco41: they have lspl
[6:50:25] holly_cow_bbq: @domroemer SeemsGood
[6:50:35] TiesAU: oh i only knew about TGA and LSPL
[6:50:46] Never_Mist: @NeiLy4ReaLy seems like a 50/50 gamble
[6:51:01] khriz0571: google
[6:51:04] CasterFroskurinn: LPPL is the reserve league and can sub directly into the LPL within a week of roster adjustments. LSPL is closer to challenger that promotes int the LPL as a team. TGA is the Tencent Games Arena is the amatuer scene that can promote into 3rd party tournaments
[6:51:04] freeko: I was going to ask the same thing, lol site only shows NA and EU challenger series on it
[6:51:08] darkblade83: zzitai is gettin stomped by scout

[6:51:19] scribbin_: Fizz midlane in 2017 EleGiggle
[6:51:23] CasterFroskurinn: @zoomenhanced to my understanding it's used for a lot of academy-esque teams.
[6:51:28] Never_Mist: @NeiLy4ReaLy you dont get a return gank
[6:51:50] CasterFroskurinn: But all those leagues are turning into the LDL which will be the promotion league into the LPL once it's franchised next year
[6:51:59] CasterFroskurinn: most likely team to be promoted is Vici Gaming Right now.
[6:52:11] Never_Mist: @NeiLy4ReaLy i mean you just hope he doesnt comeback
[6:52:12] mujarshad: sofm is outjgling clearlove so hard
[6:52:13] melillensede: OSfrog BENCH KENCH OSfrog Ardent on Tahm? Kappa
[6:52:20] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn do you think franchising is a good or bad thing for the overall health of the pro scene?
[6:52:21] CasterFroskurinn: GT GT GT
[6:52:23] Mechafanboy: To be fair though, I think Mouse was in a pretty questionable spot even without a return gank, he was sub 50% health and pushed up wasn't he?
[6:52:26] NeiLy: honestly team liquid is on the same level as SKT right now PogChamp

[6:54:43] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn I think I would much rather prefer the risk of relegation to prevent stagnation. I think franchising 3-5 years from now will end up being a really bad thing for the pro scene with stagnation of the middle/lower tier pro teams
[6:54:46] kashfumble: @xu_xu_bird he was a toplaner in ig

[6:55:29] NeiLy: hes 14/12 on elise?
[6:55:35] freeko: Plus, how would a new team get into LCS on any region after franchising aside from buying out an already existing team?
[6:55:39] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko I think that's a weird assumption. People think the motivation has to be from losing your spot, but the same motivation comes from losing your job. Last place teams don't make the same money and if the boss is tired of last place, you'll lose the spot anyway.
[6:55:43] holly_cow_bbq: @CasterFroskurinn We need new caster skins.. e.g Froskurrin Jinx, Deficio Azir, Papasmithy Zed
[6:55:57] CasterFroskurinn: I support this
[6:56:00] scribbin_: @freeko expansion ?
[6:56:06] BootOfficiaI: why tf would smithy be zed. he'd be kench
[6:56:13] Mechafanboy: Does Papasmithy get Zed cause he's smooth AF? MingLee

[7:05:44] Alohra: TriHard racist emote
[7:05:44] NeiLy: whats a kilo

[7:06:02] NeiLy: i only know really awkward american measurements sry
[7:06:07] CasterFroskurinn: it's 154
[7:06:10] SpikeJulia: YEP
[7:06:11] CasterFroskurinn: pounds
[7:06:12] LokiCatAU: i am physically unable to do squats due to a screwed up rotator cuff... can deadlift 130kg though :o
[7:06:13] Namigod: yes ni hao means hi
[7:06:15] crok0d1le: @hwkallen1 actually its "hitler did nothing wrong"
[7:06:16] BootOfficiaI: @CasterFroskurinn Good on you Fros, do you have a schedule yet?
[7:06:21] LokiCatAU: *squats with bb
[7:06:22] CasterFroskurinn: @br\DAMN
[7:06:27] NeiLy: yeah i know the conversion i just prefer to remain ignorant, like a regular american would
[7:06:28] freeko: yeah 70kg is like 155lb
[7:06:30] CasterFroskurinn: that's seriously impressive
[7:06:31] Starryshine: That's more than what I weigh
[7:06:35] one_more_plz: ni hao HeyGuys

[7:07:41] Putin_mid: 0-4
[7:07:43] Never_Mist: what are they fighting over 🤔
[7:07:45] Mechafanboy: uh.... huh. okay, that's an interesting engage...

[7:08:02] ゴブリンスレイヤー100: ni hai
[7:08:27] SpikeJulia: dajiahao XDDD
[7:08:28] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn If it were me, I would say more reps with less weight to build toward increasing the weight down the road. Same way I rebuilt myself after years of being fairly inactive
[7:08:30] holly_cow_bbq: Clearlove will Carry... Place your bets now 4Head
[7:08:38] ゴブリンスレイヤー100: ni hai
[7:08:48] mujarshad: viktor stop int BlessRNG
[7:08:49] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko I usually just copy what Rusty or Fish or Dom are doing.
[7:08:55] CasterFroskurinn: many regrets
[7:08:56] kashfumble: What dose nihai mean Kappa
[7:09:03] Gunerdrag: @CasterFroskurinn fish is the sexiest guy ive ever seen and im straight KappaPride
[7:09:07] JohnIn3D_: @sikehouston dude
[7:09:18] CasterFroskurinn: He's the sexist man I've ever seen and I'm gay
[7:09:19] VizeReZ: Ray?
[7:09:21] 哥无青春: is li hai
[7:09:28] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn well, add 5-10 reps and drop the weight down by 5 or 10kg perhaps?
[7:09:29] wearedondon: isnt zztai a toplaner?
[7:09:29] NeiLy: sexist HotPokket

[7:11:03] CasterFroskurinn: Flowers is the nicest guy
[7:11:04] NeiLy: frosk is giving u a personal cast
[7:11:10] CasterFroskurinn: he's actually just ridiculously nice
[7:11:15] holly_cow_bbq: I am Elise after 30 mins... I am helping BibleThump
[7:11:19] NeiLy: he seems like a superhuman
[7:11:28] NeiLy: like the crimson chin neily4Think
[7:11:35] JohnIn3D_: lol
[7:11:36] LokiCatAU: clearlove *could* still come back in a big way! He's still good!
[7:11:46] BootOfficiaI: also the hypest pbp caster in any pro league
[7:11:47] Hankmardukiss: impact is korean.. thats irrelevant lmao
[7:11:47] Never_Mist: hes going Liandries still but hes there only ap
[7:11:49] LokiCatAU: still winning CS >_<
[7:11:57] Namigod: you should be careful with people that are "ridiculously" nice
[7:12:03] sokphaney: too bad froskurinn cant be that nice
[7:12:05] ゴブリンスレイヤー100: if clearlove can land a godly skill shots
[7:12:06] Hankmardukiss: i fall asleep listenin to lpl
[7:12:11] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn do you think it is worthwhile to do casting for smaller leagues to try to work toward a casting job at Riot or is it better to be a pro and then convert over to casting?
[7:12:13] Mechafanboy: bit hard to comeback on Elise, Elise is more for picking
[7:12:18] Mechafanboy: Not impossible, but very hard.
[7:12:22] JohnIn3D_: @Hankmardukiss is it the asmr cast?
[7:12:25] Never_Mist: baiting baron finally
[7:12:32] Hankmardukiss: asmr ?
[7:12:37] greenmachine06: how do u fall asleep in lpl? most are chaotic af
[7:12:39] LokiCatAU: oh poor spider
[7:12:39] VizeReZ: Flowers can get hype at dull moments and it actually works for him.
[7:12:42] Never_Mist: wth
[7:12:50] Hankmardukiss: i fall asleep to the casters
[7:12:51] greenmachine06: flowers too hype
[7:12:53] NeiLy: thats what i meant about him being superhuman
[7:12:53] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko eventually most pros will take our jobs in all honesty, but I want to move into a talent management position to help train and manage our pro casters when they eventually retire and want to try it
[7:12:54] Mechafanboy: so much commitment just for a support... D:
[7:13:05] Never_Mist: they let Lucian live iguess and went for sup
[7:13:13] SteveDGamer: yeah the casters are sooooo boring
[7:13:17] uqcm: OSkomodo /
[7:13:22] CasterFroskurinn: I really want to move into production or features. Tell stories and such.
[7:13:38] LokiCatAU: is this external to the current company, @CasterFroskurinn ?
[7:13:46] Never_Mist: all of the casters are awesome in the LPL...
[7:13:59] holly_cow_bbq: @CasterFroskurinn Don't you think that old pros could be only good as analysts but not as casters?
[7:14:00] Rikururu_: OSkomodo
[7:14:02] kashfumble: How many Koreans in these two teams B)
[7:14:03] Hankmardukiss: thats ur opinion @iSeverity
[7:14:03] 100secondminutes: lol edg samdbagging
[7:14:07] NeiLy: all of riots casters are good tbh
[7:14:07] SteveDGamer: No,.... Have you seen NA or EU casters?
[7:14:10] CasterFroskurinn: @zoomenhanced I love when I get to host but our team is too small to have a solid host
[7:14:17] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn Do they let you do other shows like they have the Dive with the NA casters for example.
[7:14:22] VizeReZ: as sad as it sounds that current color casters will move out for pros, having pros is just soo nice. Krepos insight on bot lane in EU was great.
[7:14:28] CasterFroskurinn: @holly_cow_bbq some pros can cast, some will be analysts - it's a weord skill set but they have the knowledge
[7:14:30] CATGR1LL: I remember China Talk
[7:14:30] Never_Mist: @Hankmardukiss didnt say it wasnt :p
[7:14:39] Hankmardukiss: best casters are in NA .. all of them and then deficio
[7:14:44] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko yes, and I've got some plans coming ;)
[7:14:54] Mechafanboy: I've got some minor things I dislike about the lpl casters, but I don't personally think any of them are bad, or even worse than NA/EU casters.
[7:14:55] Hankmardukiss: monte was good with papa
[7:15:24] quote_me_if_perkz_died: gg
[7:15:24] Hankmardukiss: phreak n pastry are really good
[7:15:27] Mechafanboy: Papa's great though imo. Fun to listen to and yet still trollish :P
[7:15:29] CasterFroskurinn: The LPL casters are still all early in our careers and dont have as many resources as our LCS counterparts. Longer schedules, more games.
[7:15:32] chrysopelea: game 3 PogChamp
[7:15:33] freeko: well, I think deficio/quickshot is the best casting duo out of all I ahve seen.
[7:15:34] SteveDGamer: SS won game and match :D
[7:15:35] Hankmardukiss: pastry is a great shout caster
[7:15:41] CasterFroskurinn: But Papasmithy, Pastrytime, Spawn, Atlus all came from our region
[7:15:41] chrysopelea: WE gonna get first BlessRNG
[7:15:45] NeiLy: i miss deman i once watched him solo cast, and camera control an entire OW tourney it was incredible
[7:15:50] NeiLy: guarentee he wasnt getting paid enough
[7:15:50] VizeReZ: Pulse got too much flak for his casting. the guy had to work with lane swap meta. wasnt anything to cast.
[7:15:51] Never_Mist: i miss monte he , was the the simon cowell of League Brutal yet fair
[7:15:53] Mechafanboy: I was actually really sad when he went to Korea :(
[7:15:58] mujarshad: nice!
[7:15:59] Biglebowski54: fucking fixers
[7:16:00] LokiCatAU: heritage pride :p

[7:16:05] Namigod: J4 MVP
[7:16:06] darkblade83: woooooooooooo
[7:16:08] CasterFroskurinn: and I also got much better perception when I left LPL and went international. It's sometimes hard to shine on the LPL.
[7:16:08] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn does being a "foreigner" in China cause such a problem?
[7:16:08] MY_30th_ACCOUNT_TriHard: EleGiggle
[7:16:10] Starryshine: GG
[7:16:16] Hankmardukiss: not saying NA is the best with casters like homegrown.. im saying na has the best casters.. ugh nvm lol

[7:17:03] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn what riot office would be responsible for an LMS english cast potentially?
[7:17:10] Shouldof: what happened in the first game
[7:17:10] LokiCatAU: must resist 4 wheeled temptation!
[7:17:15] kashfumble: Is ren dong a Chinese caster?
[7:17:16] NeiLy: he woulda done better on lee sin that game tbh
[7:17:20] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko I don't know in all honesty

[7:18:03] LokiCatAU: 14/14 ? :p
[7:18:05] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn if there were any place I wanted to go, it would be there. I am a closet FW fan but it is so hard to get any real info from LMS right now.
[7:18:06] cantspeel: Who's your favorite bearded man in pjs?
[7:18:06] Never_Mist: BibleThump
[7:18:06] Hankmardukiss: lmao
[7:18:11] Mechafanboy: Man, I liked Krepo's casting. A lil unhype, but he was fun to listen to....
[7:18:12] Menmafuyu: krepo BibleThump
[7:18:26] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko cast the LMS! I used to cast LPL before it got a Riot broadcast
[7:18:28] Hankmardukiss: i couldnt stand how krepo used his hands when he talked :P
[7:18:47] Fickfer: man fuk krepo he liked kids
[7:18:49] mujarshad: wtf GAM is trolling in the VCSA finals
[7:18:53] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn I would love to, to be honest
[7:18:53] TenkZi: @CasterFroskurinn Holyshit, i just found out your name wasn't Casterforeskurnn
[7:18:53] Hankmardukiss: im from nyc and his hand movements maade me cringe inside
[7:18:57] Fickfer: thats so fucked
[7:19:04] VizeReZ: Krepo didnt have to be hype. he was too busy giving amazing insight to the game
[7:19:12] CasterFroskurinn: Please be respectful to Krepo or I will ban you. This is your warning.
[7:19:18] Starryshine: Leave Krepo alone BibleThump
[7:19:18] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn I think I would be over my head though, at least to start for certain.
[7:19:25] Mechafanboy: That's probably true VizeReZ.
[7:19:29] DrHonker: drhonkS
[7:19:43] Fickfer: what is disrespectfull about talking about his preferences in women?
[7:19:53] MortosHD: LUL
[7:19:58] Hankmardukiss: cant talk about krepos hand movvements .. martial law in chat
[7:20:09] Fickfer: lul
[7:20:09] freeko: I thought Krepo was good for the EU casting. Shame what happened, but I guess it is what it is and we move on.
[7:20:13] CasterFroskurinn: You understand what I'm saying and I will not tolerate it in this chat.@Fickfer
[7:20:13] LokiCatAU: im a massive papasmithy fan but there may be some Aussie bias there
[7:20:16] Never_Mist: @Hankmardukiss she wasnt talking to you derp
[7:20:23] goblinguy01: Frosk HeyGuys
[7:20:24] Hankmardukiss: im trollinggg
[7:20:28] goblinguy01: Glad to you back in chat
[7:20:33] Never_Mist: :p mhm
[7:20:37] sokphaney: toxic mod lul
[7:20:38] VizeReZ: probably? Krepo and Deficio really try to give perspective to what the players do. Krepo was the one caster to really know bot lane
[7:20:52] YukiStarCraft: SMOrc
[7:20:57] Fickfer: i mean it is a shame that too much information got out poor guy i would not like that on my record either
[7:21:02] Hankmardukiss: krep knew his shit
[7:21:03] VizeReZ: until we get Mithy on desk again we wont have that level.
[7:21:03] Namigod: wait, now you mentioned it, haven't seen krepo on EU for a while, what happened
[7:21:07] YukiStarCraft: SMOrc /
[7:21:10] weehookoo: I miss Krepo FeelsBadMan
[7:21:11] nintendolama: @casterfroskurinn can we at least free tyler 1?
[7:21:17] CasterFroskurinn: Sure
[7:21:19] Fickfer: did he quit league?
[7:21:19] swiftdandy: HotPokket Let me talk
[7:21:21] nintendolama: BigBrother
[7:21:32] Never_Mist: @Namigod stepped down to deal with personal stuff
[7:21:41] DrHonker: BigBrother
[7:21:44] BUBD: are the games still going?
[7:21:46] Hankmardukiss: eh some girl screwed him unfairly

[7:21:54] VizeReZ: @bubd yessir

[7:21:59] MANgigglingwithHANDonCHIN: that hair wtf LUL
[7:22:09] melillensede: BigBrother #FreeTyler1 BigBrother
[7:22:17] holly_cow_bbq: @weehookoo you re sixteen?
[7:22:19] Mechafanboy: True, I just don't think it transferred into an interesting cast very well unless you were interested in that sole part of the game. I preferred his random insights on how good certain movements were or the decisionmaking that went into the plays since I think Krepo articulated those really well.
[7:22:20] Never_Mist: EDG pick a better comp please
[7:22:36] MANgigglingwithHANDonCHIN: dudes hair almost as big as his head got dayum PogChamp
[7:22:36] BUBD: thanks @CasterFroskurinn bb
[7:22:54] kashfumble: What's style of pulse's haircut
[7:23:00] CasterFroskurinn: It's a mohawk
[7:23:06] cantspeel: its called peacock
[7:23:10] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn how much time do you spend with raz/pulse before or after a cast to work on just stuff in general?
[7:23:12] mollike: hwkallen1 the fucked up style xD
[7:23:16] LokiCatAU: hell of a mohawk in that case
[7:23:17] VizeReZ: @mechafanboy oh yeah i agree. if you arent looking into the game like a junior analust Krepo could be dry.
[7:23:20] BUBD: pea-cock DendiFace
[7:23:21] DrHonker: Elise incoming for clearlove Kreygasm
[7:23:24] Never_Mist: welp no triple 2-0 FeelsBadMan the ritual is failed
[7:23:27] VizeReZ: analyst*
[7:23:31] LokiCatAU: 14/14 elise lets go!
[7:23:46] overkillkott: ez for snake
[7:23:47] melillensede: Duke seems to doing great FunRun
[7:23:47] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko everyone will do development differently. We try to have one-on-one meetings once a week to discuss and this can lead to planning vod review or practice casts.
[7:23:58] SteveDGamer: SS are going to make game 3 quick :)
[7:23:58] overkillkott: thx for low coeff on snakes
[7:24:00] Never_Mist: if he picks elise again im gonna goto sleep >.>
[7:24:06] mattythemadman: hey it's the guy he'll do the thing. Go guy go!
[7:24:06] CasterFroskurinn: I used to practice cast almost everyday with Flowers in offseason
[7:24:12] Mechafanboy: *nods* be that as it may, I really did like his casting though, I felt like he put a lot of work into building chemistry with all the other casters and playing off them even if it didn't always work out :x
[7:24:20] SpikeJulia: what if lee sin？xDDDDD
[7:24:27] weehookoo: @holly_cow_bbq haHAA good one

[7:25:03] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn how long do you think it takes to develop a rapport between yorself and another caster to work together?
[7:25:07] Fickfer: riot is trying to ruin the game
[7:25:14] melillensede: @CasterFroskurinn btw is there actually a stream on Chinese? or rather do many Chinese watch the LPL
[7:25:16] BUBD: who let the peacock cast
[7:25:17] Starryshine: 5 mil on chinese stream xD

[7:45:29] CasterFroskurinn: I care about all the LPL teams. It causes me much stress
[7:45:35] astraeus999: NO CULL FeelsBadMan

[7:46:27] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko it's a guantlet that runs wildcard, quarter finals, semis, and finals. Depending on where you finish in the ladder you're seeded into the different sections. 1st in semis, 2nd in QF, 3rd vs 4th (A vs B) in Wildcard with 3rd getting a point adv in the series

[7:47:25] marandi_: Aliens want to recruit humans for theyr version of sports too
[7:47:27] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn so it is a stepladder with the lower seeded teams needing to win their way forward to advance?
[7:47:33] CYBERBOOLI__xD: TEAMS
[7:47:36] goblinguy01: @casterfroskurinn LPL Playoffs are brutal. I believe their 3rd place worlds gauntlet is even worse lol

[7:47:39] f532253947: scout lul
[7:47:48] goblinguy01: Snake had to play 10 games :(
[7:48:01] nintendolama: SKT will just win everything as usual ResidentSleeper
[7:48:05] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko yep! And they put you on opposite sides. So WE and EDG can't meet until the finals since they're from the same group
[7:48:10] goblinguy01: Poor Snake :(
[7:48:11] ゴブリンスレイヤー100: ni hao
[7:48:14] CasterFroskurinn: @goblibguy01 I remember. :(
[7:48:39] CasterFroskurinn: They actually had to clear out the stadium between the last game of WE vs Snake and the players played in an empty arena due to curfew
[7:48:45] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn so the 4th in group a plays 3rd in group b and vice versa?
[7:48:47] nintendolama: @casterfroskurinn this is the year of uzi trust BlessRNG
[7:48:51] CasterFroskurinn: Flandre played 10 games that day and limped off stage.
[7:48:55] goblinguy01: Snake has been my favorite team the Lspl. I loved Snake with Beast, Ella, U and OGs of Snake
[7:48:59] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko exactly
[7:49:13] CasterFroskurinn: @goblibguy01 you have excellent taste. Ella +U <3

[7:49:46] NeiLy: my ex's name was ella so im prejudice
[7:50:00] nintendolama: @casterfroskurinn I've just realised this is a LPL game with only 2 kills LOL
[7:50:00] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn what happens if both of the group a teams win for example in that scenario, do they make the bracket before or are things reseeded in each round?
[7:50:02] LokiCatAU: Sunday Morning Lolz comic
[7:50:03] goblinguy01: Still a snake fan. Flandre is gas, Krsytal has the best Draven, U/Tank were good Role player. Aww thank Frosk :p
[7:50:27] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko it's criss-cross. so you can face the same group if you advance through the stages
[7:50:29] astraeus999: Ella is such a posh name
[7:50:38] CasterFroskurinn: U was so UNDERRATED
[7:50:44] NeiLy: posh was my favorite spice
[7:50:47] CasterFroskurinn: he made 2014 EDG so good with his Ziggs play
[7:50:51] Saerki: U was sooo good honestly
[7:50:52] goblinguy01: I love Baka, his Xerath's can't miss

[7:51:24] westninjatct: BAKA in Royal club LSPL
[7:51:28] goblinguy01: I remember when Reddit said, "U can't be the role player Misaya was for WE." He carried them in so many games when EDG has early game issues
[7:51:34] f532253947: Ziggs Xerath ResidentSleeper

[7:52:34] goblinguy01: No. Look up Snake Baka's Xerath ult, he was amazing but shallow pool
[7:52:41] AoiiKitsune: Every time Pulse says Hudie it really sounds like Huni
[7:52:52] NeiLy: is this raz first cast
[7:52:54] AndyChrist1: ahh good to know :)
[7:52:55] Saerki: I loved the stint when EDG put Scout repeatedly on Zed
[7:53:00] CasterFroskurinn: Listen to how Pulse says "rookie" it sounds like "ruckie" because of his accent
[7:53:01] freeko: @CasterFroskurinn does being good at LoL matter when it comes to casting?
[7:53:02] halloderbaer: no Raz casted before
[7:53:04] chou701: Throw LUL
[7:53:20] NeiLy: play by play doesnt require too much game knowledge
[7:53:28] kashfumble: Ruckie. Lul
[7:53:29] eMpireoftheFallen: pulse also says "route" like "root", like a true britain
[7:53:37] JaimeeeK: @casterfroskurinn that edg win at 33 prediction is looking surprisingly on target, do you do this professionally or something DansGame
[7:53:40] NeiLy: ability names and fluent phrasing
[7:53:41] AoiiKitsune: Well you would have to know ability names but I guess you don't have to be good at the game
[7:53:42] CasterFroskurinn: @Freeko It helps but everyone learns differently. Monte would just watch games instead of play. Rusty plays at a master/challenger level so he learns from experience. I talk to pros and observe so I try to find quotes from players to justify
[7:53:46] Midnight_League: which patch is this guys pls ?
[7:53:49] CasterFroskurinn: @JaimeeeK ;)
[7:53:54] LokiCatAU: I want to hear someone go full Australian in a cast.

[7:54:12] aldric0711: Lucian LUL
[7:54:22] freeko: is playoffs on 7.16 patch or will it be on 7.15 the rest of the way?
[7:54:29] CasterFroskurinn: "that was a big fuck off gragas cask, but the other team pulled a quick spreadie and we've got a real banger here"
[7:54:34] goblinguy01: I'm glad Scout is playing full Chinese now :P
[7:54:43] darkblade83: 7.16 is the world patch right ?

[8:04:08] EdDiliciousVN: these calls are so retarded
[8:04:15] NeiLy: the whole game depends on 1 pick that can end in a baron which almost always ends the game
[8:04:16] freeko: Elise fell off, and EDG got flat dumpstered in a baron fight by Tristana autoing them all into oblivion
[8:04:16] BUBD: 95% kill p definitely elise getting outscaled
[8:04:17] AzerFraze: snake? snake?! SNAAAAAKE!

[8:04:54] BUBD: anyways ill let you guys believe w.e
[8:04:57] freeko: EDG was the team that got the pick on SofM, but got crushed in the 4v5 afterward
[8:04:59] danilgas: 322
[8:05:03] huss26_: Renekton pick was terrible. Two ADCs need hardcore tanks.

[8:06:05] AoiiKitsune: 别回应
