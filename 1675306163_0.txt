[0:25:29] jesjndd: Yes, V5 must be some insane team with how they played in summer. Go back to Reddit @shadow_typical
[0:25:36] nightrb07: cuteeee
[0:26:40] shinwinter: and now rookie back with jackylove again is that a good or bad thing ?
[0:26:44] M012345678: @jesjndd You must be a pleasant fellow
[0:26:52] shadow_typical: its a good thing
[0:27:10] salsaguty: mvp in scrims?
[0:27:16] shinwinter: well i hope so
[0:27:21] shadow_typical: @jesjndd you said trash players and trash team which implies rookie and photic played bad
[0:27:23] jesjndd: Definitely more pleasant than Redditors who said for 4 months straight that V5 was the best team in the world 🤣🤣
[0:27:44] shinwinter: Sadge rookie BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:28:19] CJholder99: @jesjndd imagine calling rookie trash
[0:28:19] shadow_typical: bro blocked his whispers to avoid getting flamed
[0:28:26] jesjndd: @shadow_typical when I say trash players that doesn’t necessarily mean I’m referring to all the players. But I am referring to a majority of them
[0:28:45] shadow_typical: the only bad players were rich karsa xlb
[0:29:37] shinwinter: i hoep he's goes to worlds next year i wanna see him vs faker shwomaker <3
[0:29:59] leo5789: TES Rookie, JDG Ruler
[0:30:28] salsaguty: is this when kkoma was coach for vici
[0:30:44] jesjndd: @shinwinter he would get mogged so hard by Faker who isn’t even a top 4 mid in LCK. Thoughts?

[0:32:34] shinwinter: @CJholder99  true
[0:32:36] jesjndd: @shinwinter “you must be a new viewer”, is that the new copium for people who rate your favorite players low? 🤡
[0:33:03] jesjndd: @ixw1234 one of the best mids who hasn’t been on a top team globally for 4 years straight. 😭
[0:33:10] jesjndd: Keep up the cope
[0:33:23] shadow_typical: you can be a good player and be on a shit team

[0:34:01] CJholder99: @jesjndd your logic FeelsDankMan bad team = bad player
[0:34:23] 大老爺: gg
[0:34:30] jesjndd: @cjholder99 I didn’t say he was bad, I just said he’s not one of the best
[0:34:37] shinwinter: @CJholder99  he didnt even follow lpl ch more than a year what r u expect from him XD
[0:34:46] shadow_typical: how is he not one of the best
[0:34:54] jesjndd: There’s a huge difference, thinking Rookie is anywhere near the top 10-15 mids in the world is just delusional
[0:35:00] tatocastro4: i love karsa
[0:35:09] shadow_typical: he carried a roster with rich and karsa
[0:35:14] shadow_typical: and he isnt top tier
[0:35:17] 最愛喵喵的小雪: ......
[0:35:19] shadow_typical: despite his insane perfomances
[0:35:23] jesjndd: He has made 0 impact on the scene for 4 years straight now, and after this year it will be 5 years straight. Since TES are gonna suck
[0:35:24] shadow_typical: you’re just delusional
[0:35:27] SirGarland: TOP GAP
[0:35:30] ixw1234: name ur top 10 or 15 mids then?

[0:43:37] jesjndd: Or does that only apply to trash tier cookie 😭😭
[0:43:56] ixw1234: bad team != bad region like vicla will just decay playing in na for a year
[0:43:56] Treeds: he wouldve found a decent team otherwise, FLYQUEST isnt even top 40 best worlds teams
