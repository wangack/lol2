[0:58:58] astraeus999: @Sinrus leona also sucks vs kench
[0:59:00] Sinrus: @Saerki Then pick Leona and shove that nerd's face in the dirt
[0:59:06] Saerki: @sinrus alistar was picked before tahm

[0:59:54] Sinrus: 0@EUWRyze I wouldn't say sucks. He has counter tools for her engage, but she can still CC Kench and burn down his health. Esp with Kalista
[0:59:55] Âô¢Âô¢‰∏â: Stop trading objects and start fighting FailFish It's LPL
[0:59:57] OfficialUknoww: I thought snake had it lmfao
[1:00:12] Sinrus: @Âô¢Âô¢‰∏â LPL is now EU Kappa
[1:00:16] Saerki: leona is pretty good into tahm
[1:00:22] Saerki: but kinda horrible as a blind pick
[1:00:27] GummiGrim: Are you sure?
[1:00:32] goblinguy01: Trusting Snake is as bad as trusting Liquid LUL
[1:00:39] GummiGrim: It would seem like Tahm would just swallow whoever gets E'd on

[1:00:41] Phd_In_Swag: @mnm10210 Well I'm glad your not the caster bc you can't even make sense.
[1:00:58] goblinguy01: I mean realistically, WE will 2-0 this, but Snake needs to not lose passively
[1:01:01] OfficialUknoww: Blood moon kalista worth buying?
[1:01:08] Saerki: @gummigrim The point of picking leona into tahm is to engage repeatedly
[1:01:12] darkblade83: snake :(
[1:01:13] enjoythecode: Solo dragon PogChamp
[1:01:14] Sinrus: @Saerki Agreed. Leona is a garbage blind pick. Really strong if you know what the botlane is looking like
[1:01:16] goblinguy01: WE are the aggressive and pressing Snake Bot Cs.
[1:01:20] desolace_: @officialuknoww no it's noob skin , wait for SKT or championship
[1:01:23] makintoos1: lethality Jhin into 3 tanks is questionable
[1:01:35] Saerki: Because leona out-cd's tahm's devour
[1:01:42] interpol909: why would u engage on tahm ?
[1:01:46] W0lfmanHD: @phd_in_swag not my job anyways. im always ResidentSleeper with this guy is what i mean

[1:02:11] Miitniick: @officialuknoww championship the best
[1:02:12] 100secondminutes: mystic is a god
[1:02:14] Sinrus: @makintoos1 def. I don't know why jhin is still so popular now that everyone is playing Tanks. He feels more like a reaction pick
[1:02:22] astraeus999: @Sinrus QSS on kench vs leona shuts her down entirely....at least with alistar QSS doesn't work against his primary CC
[1:02:24] Âô¢Âô¢‰∏â: ResidentSleeper
[1:02:36] Sov25: @video_boi all I'm seeing is clown macro play
[1:02:39] Saerki: I'd argue jhin is a brilliant pick with a bruiser top like Camille or Renekton

[1:17:19] DanielSPoA: as I said, Elise is useless later on.. she didn't have the early impact they expected and now they are stuck without a proper front line unless Cho is with them

[1:19:13] interpol909: C9 PogChamp
[1:19:13] Phd_In_Swag: @Sinrus Bronze, Silver, Gold are all low elo. He has to depend on his abilities. His auto range is shite, and yeah you could say that man, but that's Solo Q mentality. Basically saying teemo is good bc he can play against garen, riven, and darius.
[1:19:25] AmazingSalvia: playing jhin against 3 tanks is soo much fun!
[1:19:28] Sinrus: I cry whenever I see Maokai build 0 AP

[1:20:02] 100secondminutes: lol look at this idiot trying to win the game
[1:20:03] BettingDegen: I cry whenever I see Maokai with no deathcap Biblethump
[1:20:08] Sinrus: @Phd_In_Swag And yeah, he has to rely on his abilities. His abilites that provide strong CC. He wants to pick and avoid teamfights. You have a team that can facilitate that, then you are golden
[1:20:10] chitose777: 45ish hours til skt vs kt Kreygasm
[1:20:25] Sinrus: @Phd_In_Swag Yes you can. This is a team game where you literally get to see the enemy team as they pick champs and you get to see yours
[1:20:35] Saerki: @Phd_In_Swag And the point stands that in soloQ and in competitve Jhin isn't a bad situational pick into teams that need engage potential
