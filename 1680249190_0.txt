[0:08:43] Rhikaroo: i thought you needed to track private jets to get banned on twitter these days
[0:09:04] Rhikaroo: ahaha i didnt see that
[0:09:06] BlueSapphyre: Snap ate all my desire for Hearthstone.
[0:09:12] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[0:09:15] KDogg241: not just suspended, perma'd
[0:09:15] Caruda: you get a ban, and you get a ban
[0:09:20] Sonatta: @Rhikaroo all you need to do is call him out for doing the same thing with a guy and his car hours after posting the new TOS
[0:09:28] Nurama: Free Speach KEKW
[0:09:39] Rhikaroo: @Sonatta thats kinda hilarious

[0:10:29] Tekri: yeah I don't care if twitter stays live. it's fun to watch all the crazy shit
[0:10:49] kolmgorov: Didn't he do the whole "twitter files" thing b/c twitter banned links to the story about the Hunter binden thing? ISnt he doing the same thing?
[0:10:53] Rhikaroo: thats my approach Tekri, just watching the mayhem without a stake in it
[0:11:13] boxofpants: something will just replace it...
[0:11:17] Caruda: he was either going to improve it, or destroy it.  both are fine
[0:11:31] Sonatta: Hive üêù
[0:11:33] BlueSapphyre: @splatterdoll i‚Äôm too smooth brain for mastodon.
[0:11:40] Eplesh: YES

[0:11:51] SlipCrit: coxNod
[0:11:51] boxofpants: warhammer henry cavil what
[0:11:56] Rhikaroo: amazon less POG
[0:12:05] Zizen: ijpCHEER
[0:12:10] NoorElBahrain: hypeE
[0:12:11] BlueSapphyre: Cavill would make a great Leman Russ.
[0:12:13] Eplesh: the "Executive Produce" is super important
[0:12:15] Tekri: @itmejp did you saw the valve interview in the Verge decent information
[0:12:20] Gertew: PepeHands Cavill Superman
[0:12:22] SplatterDoll: @BlueSapphyre hive is good too, but it is super slow an buggy right now. and only on mobile
[0:12:26] Sonatta: they'll have all the money for that movie
[0:12:37] Rhikaroo: you need money to do it
[0:12:39] ok_juju: ohh either it will be great or ijpONO
[0:12:44] Eplesh: Nerd right here
[0:12:59] boxofpants: not really
[0:13:01] Eplesh: well no
[0:13:01] ObliviousToMe: PJ is back?
[0:13:01] AlphaMetal: We‚Äôve had like 50 bad games what one bad show going to do?
[0:13:12] Rhikaroo: i've never heard that
[0:13:14] bolt0n: GW will have the final say its their IP.. and they are known to make good decisions... NOT
[0:13:18] AlphaMetal: We still got dark tide that‚Äôs all that matters ijpSIP
[0:13:19] Tekri: maybe a race is but never heard about that
[0:13:23] Moose2033: I saw someone say Eisenhorn for Henry, and I could see it
[0:13:23] Darkaros: peepoArrive JP did nazi that coming
[0:13:27] boxofpants: i mean it does make fun of facism but it wasn't like it's goal or anything
[0:13:31] Eplesh: Its a mockery of everything bad and shitty
[0:13:40] Ebra: Ebra subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! ijpKEK
[0:13:40] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Ebra! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:14:01] NoorElBahrain: Well I doubt it will be as bad as Halo since Cavill loves WH40K and he is on the creative team
[0:14:05] Eplesh: everyone dies, everyone is scared, everyone wants to be on "the right side" but there is no "right side" everyone is bad
[0:14:07] FataltheBaptist: jp how is doggie care going
[0:14:22] l1ttlelechuga: i love pj time ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS ijpNODDERS
[0:14:26] boxofpants: the orignal characters were parodies and pop culture references
[0:14:29] ok_juju: 40k is dark nothing is good in the stars
[0:14:30] NoorElBahrain: I mean the creative team wanted to do their own thing
[0:14:30] Sonatta: Halo was Paramount made by a bunch of people who didn't play the games and wanted to make their own thing
[0:14:31] SMonTwitch: Good to hear it‚Äôs getting better
[0:14:38] SMonTwitch: Oh boy, okay
[0:14:39] boxofpants: like obi-kan trader guy and stuff
[0:14:49] Moose2033: 40k takes a lot of popular ideas and makes them Grim dark, like Professor X
[0:14:51] ObliviousToMe: Dog not dying is a good thing
[0:14:53] FataltheBaptist: they pick up on that
[0:15:01] Nurama: oof
[0:15:04] KDogg241: I have that problem too.
[0:15:05] Chiibsy: animals do be empathic
[0:15:06] FataltheBaptist: bill burr had a joke to that effect
[0:15:07] Eplesh: Another important note on 40K, one of the literal black library autors is one of the writers for Arcane @itmeJP
[0:15:08] AlphaMetal: I think we could get a filter behind dark PJ and turn you into that smoking guy from Control
[0:15:18] Tekri: and that lead to a shit volcano?
[0:15:26] Rhikaroo: i'm curious what the focus of warhammer as a show would be, i assume space marines since Mr. Cavil is involved, but would it be the classic trio off orcs, elders, marines or would it be imperials since its "easier"
[0:15:31] SplatterDoll: yeah my cats and I share panic attack time
[0:15:38] FataltheBaptist: a Control Rpg one shot
[0:15:41] Sonatta: oh lord... Twitter drama update... Twitter is blocking Mastodon links to the banned journalists
[0:15:49] FataltheBaptist: he could be Eisenhorn
[0:15:50] Eplesh: He wanted to be an inquisitor
[0:15:51] Eplesh: not a marine
[0:15:52] Price_FTW: Enjoyed Last Call this week, JP. I forget though, did yall say this was the last one till January or next week?
[0:16:08] Godlypwng: inquisitors are pretty neat as a show focus
[0:16:17] FataltheBaptist: have the big show paul white be the space marine lol
[0:16:19] dudwasup: He‚Äôs using Tesla as an atm for Twitter
[0:16:21] Sonatta: Henry Cavill as Horus ijpHMM
[0:16:24] Shrimp_Parm: PepoChamp TeaTime
[0:16:34] Darkaros: PepoChamp
[0:16:37] doomdrake13: He could be an Inquisitor or a Rogue Trader - that way you could have more intrique stuff than with a Space marine.
[0:16:37] SMonTwitch: Pog
[0:16:40] NoorElBahrain: DunkChamp
[0:16:41] falcos01: rare stream ?
[0:16:54] Tekri: bronze still the DM?
[0:16:55] NoorElBahrain: PJ knows a lot of JP stuff
[0:16:57] FataltheBaptist: ep 3 had me rolling l
[0:16:58] Price_FTW: will Crew one be making cameos or we wrapping until some massive crossover?
[0:17:00] Circuit____: loving Last Call, this is the 1st D7D series that I have watched from the start.
[0:17:01] ok_juju: probably eiserhorn like inqusition stories the best for tv
[0:17:02] BlueSapphyre: Rogue Trader would be a dope setting.
[0:17:04] Godlypwng: a Rogue Trader show would be interesting
[0:17:05] doomdrake13: !PJ

[0:18:44] FataltheBaptist: @fantomexpls do not re install
[0:18:45] razer45678: Why isn‚Äôt it JP in PJ‚Äôs?
[0:18:53] fantomexpls: Its still doing well

[0:19:04] fantomexpls: Short queue times
[0:19:04] Tekri: better then most people expect
[0:19:08] l1ttlelechuga: how was your day pj?
[0:19:08] Syllvn: Good I play daily, Qs are quick
[0:19:15] Deathspate: Pretty good I think
[0:19:16] Masterpug13: Good, but I think they are all waiting for single player stuff to launch.
[0:19:31] FataltheBaptist: i started cult of lamb 2 days ago and played for 9.4 hrs straight
[0:19:32] fantomexpls: Tank 3 minutes, sometimes 4. DPS usually less than 3 minutes
[0:19:34] Rhikaroo: TBD i think
[0:19:36] CrashTestGremlin: I downloaded and 5 out of 5 ai matches took 10 minutes each to join, I uninstalled.
[0:20:12] AlphaMetal: Sorry I missed it when is dark and darker free? I wanted to try that one out if I could gather a group
[0:20:13] fantomexpls: I wouldnt
[0:20:17] fantomexpls: KEKW

[0:24:41] ObliviousToMe: Ellipes are forever....
[0:24:45] Ozryel626: Also PJ how do I transfer my ultra rare Trump NFT collectible cards into Marvel Snap? It‚Äôs only $99 per variant!
