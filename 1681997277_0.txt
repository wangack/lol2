[0:48:03] ThatWazGuy: he's like poppy, better near walls
[0:48:07] NoorElBahrain: Jammies
[0:48:20] AinzN: Jammies peepoFlute
[0:48:36] ThatWazGuy: oh yeah, he's got kill xp
[0:48:43] sack02: if he ults you right after you use silence he probably wins
[0:48:52] Shoaron: AAAA
[0:48:57] optiKail: What addons does the salty one use
[0:49:37] Darkaros: !lolapp
[0:49:40] bobphrapples: can go through walls and takes you with him
[0:49:45] sack02: pushes you a set distance, or through a wall then changes form
[0:49:47] Felgrun: Pushes you through a wall and deals a lot of damage on autos
[0:49:53] merc____: also transforms him
[0:49:58] NoorElBahrain: peepoFlute
[0:49:58] Shoaron: now that league has recommended runes, there's no need for those overlay apps ijpH
[0:50:00] Darkaros: !app
[0:50:00] itmeBOT: JP has used u.gg and Porofessor, thinks both of them are equally alright-ish, and currently uses Porofessor.
[0:50:01] sack02: new form makes his armor into damage and omnivamp and new abilities
[0:50:11] merc____: but loses almost all res and armor
[0:50:13] RlDennis: If it actually pushes you against the wall you'll appear on the other side of it yeah
[0:50:14] bairdman: iirc  if he hits you witha wall you go through it and then he gets a steroid, more ad for less resistances
[0:50:18] RhylerH: Its a slight push but if he pushes you into a wall you both go all the way through and his tank stats turn into damage stats
[0:50:27] The_zuriel: it does cut his hp down to like 30% tho so he is lowish so u could punish with ult
[0:50:42] RlDennis: I think it's less max hp, more damage, omnivamp, lower resistances and cooldowns?

[0:53:42] bobphrapples: sylas is broken
[0:53:46] sack02: yeah
[0:53:51] AinzN: @notwax this is CK3 LoFi music
[0:53:51] The_zuriel: he ulted when he got ganked
[0:53:52] SuicidalFloopy: he did when you killed him
[0:53:52] sack02: he did his ult earlier
[0:54:07] notwax: @AinzN thanks
[0:54:10] Darkaros: Sadge can't believe JP actually played Noor's suggestion and ignored mine
[0:54:10] HedgyV: @AinzN , really?  Not bad at all.
[0:54:15] RhylerH: We he ults his health bar with have a white line and his weapon model will change to be sharp
[0:54:24] Johnny2Cs: That was his dash, it’s like ~15 sex
[0:54:28] Johnny2Cs: Seconds
[0:54:28] AinzN: If people want the playlist this is what Noor linked earlier https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8kngl-5aSI
[0:54:29] NoorElBahrain: Darkaros ijpSAD
[0:54:33] Darkaros: no you didn't i didn't hear the numbers Madge
[0:55:02] bobphrapples: no warwick
[0:55:05] Shoaron: oof so close
[0:55:56] notwax: @AinzN thanks
[0:56:24] bobphrapples: war of attrition
[0:56:39] HedgyV: I know I haven't played in a while, but it's nice to see Lux being played.
[0:56:53] Shoaron: his tp should be back up by now
[0:57:04] Johnny2Cs: You can back in a cannon wave and he shouldn’t be able to push it in time
[0:57:34] bobphrapples: you're up a level
[0:57:54] BarsS1mpson: I'm sure it has already been said but if you play LoL through GamePass all heroes are unlocked. It immediately got me playing.
[0:58:08] HedgyV: NICE!
[0:58:12] bobphrapples: omg this guy has no k'sante skills
[0:58:29] HedgyV: Smart.  Jungler is probably coming up top.
[0:58:32] sack02: is jaksho any good on garen?
[0:58:33] ThatWazGuy: yeah, k'sante is missing most of his Q's
[0:58:38] Shoaron: @bobphrapples it's a new champ and this is silver LUL
[0:58:45] RlDennis: @Radiosurgery I think you can also just link your microsoft account to your riot account
[0:58:47] bobphrapples: @Shoaron aahhhh
[0:58:53] KonikMiejski: jak'sho is a new tank item
[0:58:59] HedgyV: Help you to push the tower down.,
[0:59:27] NoorElBahrain: Jammies
[0:59:51] Felgrun: music go brrrrrr
[0:59:51] bobphrapples: warwick has 0.00 mana
[1:00:00] sack02: and tower mid for teemo
[1:00:20] AinzN: Not even close!
[1:00:20] ThatWazGuy: ww's regen at 0 hp is nuts
[1:00:24] Shoaron: found a sick dubstep tr rack yesterday can I share with chat?
[1:00:29] bobphrapples: the flash secured it LuL
[1:00:39] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play! JP's Twitch contract has ended, and as a member of the ads incentive program he no longer has precise control over when ads run. Ads will run 6 minutes automatically every hour. As always, subscribing to the channel prevents ads. Thanks! ijpLOVE
[1:00:47] ThatWazGuy: used the flash to cancel an auto and win anneKappa
[1:00:51] AinzN: @Shoaron only if you promise I'll get full on wubbed!
[1:00:52] Shoaron: yes but not by much
[1:01:11] HedgyV: Just keep doing your thing, JP.  You are in a good spot IMO.
[1:01:17] bobphrapples: beat em up
[1:01:19] bobphrapples: he ulted
[1:01:27] Johnny2Cs: Everyone panic flashes from time to time all good
[1:01:59] HedgyV: haha, I hear that, @Johnny2Cs .
[1:02:06] bobphrapples: letsss goooo
[1:02:26] bobphrapples: baus would say "good death"
[1:02:43] HedgyV: You brought 2 to top and let your team get dragon.  Smart plays.
[1:02:57] bobphrapples: get some heal cut
[1:03:11] bobphrapples: nice
[1:03:36] Shoaron: AinzN did you get the whisper? it not registering on my mobile app
[1:03:59] AinzN: @Shoaron yeah I got it and I replied to it. It's alright. COuld be wubbier

[1:04:39] lord_baggabutts: doogCLAPPING
[1:05:06] RlDennis: Depends on how much you lose, I think?
[1:05:15] RlDennis: LP wise that is
[1:05:24] Veilshadow: Is that how that actually works?
[1:05:24] AdamBadr1: just rewatched the original avengers again and damn thats still such a good movie
[1:05:26] AinzN: But if you climbed easily then it wouldn't be fun
[1:05:36] lord_baggabutts: we all belong in silver
[1:05:50] HedgyV: Yeah, they want people to grind.  You know, player retention.  /shrug
[1:05:54] Shoaron: LUL
[1:05:57] Whatnos: it really sucks that that's how the ranked system works. It bascally encourages you to smurf so you can get a reset on that value
[1:06:00] 14neo: Diamond ijpPRAY Clap
[1:06:04] Felgrun: I was silver like 5 seasons ago, i might be friggin bronze now idk

[1:06:18] Neragsito: you left that hanging there so easy JP
[1:06:19] Johnny2Cs: Your CS is above avg for silver imo
[1:06:22] galdamesh: ~100 games will get you to were you "deserve" to be
[1:06:36] HedgyV: ANy thoughts on the "Sunlight" lamp yet, or still too soon?
[1:06:49] AinzN: I'm waiting for Erin to like flip a switch at Riot on April Fool's day and have JP show up as Diamond ijpKEK
[1:06:53] shatteredsaint: bots the mid from last game
[1:06:57] Darkaros: have you considered doing what my friend does and just make a billion accounts, play only for ranking winning streaks to say you're challenger, then quit the account if you lose
[1:07:07] Shoaron: @galdamesh not if these feeders and leavers got anything to say about it ijpSUFFER
[1:07:21] RlDennis: It was for swapping the pick order apparently? That seems new LUL
[1:07:35] RhylerH: Having been playing some ranked on wild rift lately I wish they would implement the system they have for ranked there
[1:07:39] Felgrun: Man, i'd love for some cold weather right now, summer is kicking my ass
[1:07:58] Darkaros: jp i play clockwerk and the last time you played dota 2 you said you hated every one who ever played him
[1:07:59] RlDennis: pro players get an account from riot that starts at.. diamond mmr? Something like that
[1:07:59] AdamBadr1: join us dark
[1:08:01] AinzN: Which Champ would Darkaros main?
[1:08:04] The_zuriel: @RlDennis it is new, it was added this patch or last patch Iirc you can request to swap pick order with anyone now
[1:08:05] HedgyV: @Felgrun , you in AUS/NZ by chance or is my thinking off?
[1:08:09] Johnny2Cs: You can fix mmr by winning more as dumb as that sounds
[1:08:19] AdamBadr1: LUL
[1:08:21] ghostsofcarcosa: The double down
[1:08:21] 14neo: Clockwerk players Madge
[1:08:33] galdamesh: @Shoaron in a 5v5 game if you are one of the people and you are better then the other 9 statistically you will win more then lose regardless over a large enough sample size
[1:08:52] Shin_gx: ijpKEK
[1:08:57] galdamesh: @Shoaron and it's ~100 that gets you there
[1:08:58] Felgrun: @HedgyV Brazil but I guess AUS is in the same predicament
[1:09:01] 14neo: the call-back ijpD
[1:09:11] tripponstuff: that tracks, i remember my clockwerk binge that was a dark time
[1:09:21] RhylerH: Is clockwerk like zilean in league?
[1:09:27] HedgyV: @Felgrun , ahh, gotcha.  Yeah, you are both below the equator so your summer.  I just watch a lot of AUS streamers is why I asked.
[1:09:27] Rodwolt: he's the guy that punches
[1:09:30] bobphrapples: yeah, sett sucks
[1:09:32] Neragsito: you can fight him
[1:09:36] cleitc01: don't know wasn't there
[1:09:39] AinzN: Sett's name is even SettIsDumpChamp
[1:09:39] Neragsito: but it's annoying
[1:09:40] The_zuriel: he is the punch guy that suplexes you
[1:09:49] Johnny2Cs: No you are thinking of Malphite
[1:09:51] Darkaros: "the adc who has the ultimate"
[1:10:01] Shoaron: LUL
[1:10:12] HedgyV: There is a reason that "1v9" has always been a thing in league.
[1:10:21] AinzN: Clockwork got an update where he has a jetpack now
[1:10:41] 14neo: @AinzN with aghs yeah?
[1:10:44] RhylerH: OOooh a jarven blitz hybrid with a dash it seems yeah?
[1:10:44] AinzN: He flies across the map basically
[1:10:45] eXePanic: Been loving dota recently - every character is bullshit so it all balances out
[1:10:46] NoorElBahrain: he is like playing kirby in smash
[1:10:57] Fynagle: You one of those those "Bro I can carry the game if <insert condition>!"  yet? Those are always amusing.
[1:11:07] HedgyV: That sounds quite like ultimate OP, @NoorElBahrain , haha.
[1:11:23] AinzN: @14neo yeah with one of the Aghs upgrades
[1:11:41] Neragsito: Garen is not pompous!
[1:11:42] RlDennis: map wide dash? Beta twisted fate when his ult was one of his basic abilities. LUL but it's a teleport
[1:11:43] Darkaros: CrungoSpin
[1:11:44] gunstars20: DEMACIAA LUL
[1:11:50] CocoScruff: actor that played jamie lanister would be a good match imo
[1:11:51] NoorElBahrain: HedgyV a friend who picks kirby in smash when you play together has chosen to be the enemy
[1:11:51] Ebra: CrungoCycle
[1:11:58] Shin_gx: jiyuSpin
[1:12:05] Giant0ctopus: i wanna see draven in arcane
[1:12:10] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @Neragsito How can you say that. He is so racist. He even hates his own sister
[1:12:11] HedgyV: @NoorElBahrain , haha, I'll bet.
[1:12:21] AinzN: Noor does that mean we can't be friends? ijpS
[1:12:21] lord_baggabutts: Is Garren and Kat's story still romeo and juliet?
[1:12:21] Darkaros: Clockwerk is so fun. It used to be that his max level ultimate went across literally a third of the map to stun you then drag him to you, on a 12s cooldown
[1:12:40] Shoaron: all I expect from Demacia is hyper racism against magic users
[1:12:47] Rodwolt: ijpKEK what
[1:12:49] NoorElBahrain: AinzN we can when not playing smash peepoGiggles
[1:12:53] RhylerH: You have flash advantage now

[1:13:23] AinzN: Noor I'll just play Sonic then. I've made sure to have a few mains in case my friends ban Kirby ijpKEK
[1:13:23] sack02: unironically a good a death
[1:13:24] Felgrun: All I want is for daddy ASol to show up for a second in arcane, then I die happy
[1:13:49] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @lord_baggabutts Garren and lux are sister. but yes they has be lore that they could be dating
[1:13:50] NoorElBahrain: AinzN sonicRun
[1:13:59] Neragsito: eh, you heal fast
[1:14:04] RlDennis: Oh man, asol in arcane would actually look insane LUL just a dragon appearing in the night sky. Being all sassy
[1:14:27] Fynagle: Easy and safe farm when he hard-pushes into lane so hard.
[1:14:53] HedgyV: I can see Riot taking the Avatar route with Arcane.  Will be 5+ years for season 2.
[1:14:57] RlDennis: LUL Ekko leeching exp yeah
[1:15:09] Shoaron: this ekko just tilting his top now LUL
[1:15:17] RhylerH: JP setts cool downs early are a bit longer than yours so if he ever wiffs an ability you should be able to go in and win the trade

[1:16:01] RlDennis: Nice ijpCHEER
[1:16:06] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: sett falls off so hard. also he week against very long fights
[1:16:07] lord_baggabutts: @lord_baggabutts peepoLeave Get your fanfic out of here. I asked about Garren & Katarina
[1:16:13] NoorElBahrain: WeirdDude who is this JP? PJ is the current owner of the stream
[1:16:13] Fynagle: Lucky Ekko wasn't paying attention to counter-gank.
[1:16:16] Neragsito: echo is mid
[1:16:24] RhylerH: Never feel dirty about putting someone else in the dirty playing league
[1:16:25] Neragsito: coulda made a slate

[1:17:21] Fynagle: Oh no, it's like Ekko leeching xp didn't help Sett at all.
[1:17:48] Felgrun: Nah under tower is a bit risky
[1:17:56] Thod_Nysid: !pj

[1:17:57] itmeBOT: PJ is JP's monochrome menace alter ego. He loves competitive games, salt mines and long walks on the beach.
[1:17:57] Neragsito: save the ult for after the shield
[1:18:13] sack02: he did have to flash for it

[1:18:21] mett7: LUL
[1:18:27] Fynagle: A bottom feeder with biceps for days though

[1:21:01] RhylerH: Nah that's on hec to know PJ shouldnt have to ping for him
[1:21:56] Fynagle: Wave control is a weird and subtle thing that's always more key than one thinks.
[1:22:09] Ebra: no

[1:28:15] EvilBuho: Actually ended up downloading the game. Pray for me
[1:28:16] Poobzee: i've learned when its like this to just tunnel vision lane
[1:28:17] AinzN: @EvilBuho probably a bunch but they wouldn't be this rank thought would they?
[1:28:34] Fynagle: Hec is one of the stronger solo-carry junglers right now, think the player saw the vid and didn't pay attention to what to do.
[1:28:36] arrowdeath4: you improve your negotiation skills when you try to negotiate the ff?
[1:28:44] rubxcubedude: these types of games make me think abouut changing position but then its just as bad in other positions
[1:28:44] Poobzee: i just forget everyone else they're not worth it
[1:28:46] EvilBuho: @AinzN very true.
[1:28:49] mett7: PJ should be out of reach for gamepass noobs :P
[1:29:29] TDotTerror: Goddamn, you basically have all the kills.
[1:29:33] TDotTerror: 'winnable'
[1:29:35] TDotTerror: LuL
[1:29:38] EvilBuho: NotLikeThis
[1:29:41] loki15kun: I wonder if the matchmaking algoritm, expects you to carry solo in some insane way? That feels so strange
[1:29:42] ZirhcM: It's also crazy that with how much you left lane you still have most CS on your team lol
[1:29:52] cmac1086: Can’t let it bother you def go next

[1:32:31] titanodin: kids play this game
[1:32:36] Deathspate: I just joined, did JP make his team lose again Kappa
[1:32:43] Mograw: Here it is
[1:32:46] bulletsponge55: Like "what did I do to deserve these teams?"
[1:32:46] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: you have 3 first timers in your team
[1:32:50] cmac1086: Lol
[1:32:51] gunstars20: LUL
[1:32:58] mett7: oh boi LUL

[1:33:20] arrowdeath4: apparently you were on the wrong side of a comeback story something
[1:33:21] titanodin: you were the losing team lol
[1:33:33] Ebra: ijpKEK
[1:33:38] Snowman_Sir: cohhHmm
[1:33:47] TylerDrake1790: Is JP doing the 12 rages of Christmas or something?
[1:33:54] Fynagle: They do like "impactful" as a word.
[1:34:15] mett7: feedback? Fck you and also blablabla LUL
[1:34:22] fantomexpls: KEKW
[1:34:24] Thod_Nysid: @Fynagle "Impactful" it's gamer dev speak.
[1:34:27] Ebra: man, not even giving you points for completing it
[1:34:33] bobphrapples: next patch "JP survey says"
[1:34:47] loki15kun: I hope they use the data
[1:34:50] Fynagle: @Thod_Nysid You mean like "going forward" and "sensitivity training"?
[1:35:07] Mograw: JP, are you Catholic
[1:35:12] Moose2033: I get the feeling that they want bounties to be a comeback mechanic
[1:35:12] arrowdeath4: the highs are so high, though
[1:35:20] Thod_Nysid: @Fynagle Eyyyy, you get it!@
[1:35:21] Mograw: That would've explained everything
[1:35:25] Snowman_Sir: @loki15kun It sounds like the report they use to have, to get steam of the players. But it doesn't do anything.
[1:35:34] highgroundy: I think with league I always to go in with a mindset of there are things you literally cannot control
[1:35:38] a1gohan: i feel like thats just mobas in general it brings out the worse in people
[1:35:41] bobphrapples: valorant is just another shooter
[1:35:45] titanodin: i mean it was fucking hype when you slid around the corner and killed 3 people
[1:35:49] sack02: league is 100x better with a duo honestly
[1:36:07] Shin_gx: wideVIBE
[1:36:14] mett7: League should have big health warnnings everywhere just like pack of ciggs LUL
[1:36:16] loki15kun: @loki15kun that is sad to hear.
[1:36:19] TylerDrake1790: @a1gohan it brings out a lot of the “it’s not you, blame the other guy” mentality
[1:36:25] Deathspate: Oof
[1:36:25] Whatnos: LUL
[1:36:29] TheSlyLemon: fuck that sucks man
[1:36:37] bobphrapples: zekeLUL league brings people apart
[1:36:42] titanodin: i duo when i find a good lane partner but i mainly play support so that easier for me
[1:37:00] RhylerH: Duoing with a mod or viewer is off the table then?
[1:37:04] bobphrapples: no
[1:37:07] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @sack02  the problem is once you get silver 2 or hire people start hard trolling due que.
[1:37:08] bobphrapples: just codenames
[1:37:08] QuixotesSquire: QuixotesSquire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 81 months, currently on a 81 month streak! ijp7

[1:37:13] a1gohan: get cohh to play i mean he played guilty gear maybe you can get him in to this aswell :P
[1:37:14] TDotTerror: It's to prevent stream sniping.
[1:37:14] RhylerH: Hidden names
[1:37:16] Snowman_Sir: @loki15kun kinda, but at least there have been some changes recently to combat toxicity. Hopium for more good changes. cohhBless
[1:37:20] titanodin: wtf i never seen that before
[1:37:35] bobphrapples: yeah, ally 1-5 sucked
[1:37:37] Deathspate: It's just filler names to prevent people from looking up people in the lobby
[1:37:39] RlDennis: They're to keep people from looking up op.gg and other kinds of sites to look up their stats (to prevent dodging and such). To my knowledge atleast
[1:37:44] Snowman_Sir: Looking up names? not anymore! snowma35Feelschristmasman
[1:37:47] loki15kun: @loki15kun stripPray
[1:37:48] Sonatta: snap peepoRun
[1:37:53] titanodin: token shop whatcha got for me
[1:37:57] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: @sack02  I was just in a game where we lost because we had a due que and my mid laner said we wanted all due quer to lose
[1:37:57] cmac1086: Prevent looking up your teams stats and dodging
[1:38:03] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: so he ran it down
[1:38:07] Fynagle: Ooo that reminds me, gotta get into WoW and go flip a table in a dungeon for a WQ.
[1:38:21] titanodin: oh shit i got knull in my token shop
[1:38:30] titanodin: but it will take a year to get 6k
[1:39:01] Johnny2Cs: I got mystique in my token shop I’ve been looking for her

[1:39:45] bobphrapples: aatrox raid boss
[1:39:57] Giant0ctopus: ay ay trox
[1:40:02] Johnny2Cs: She hulk is a ton of fun but Leader is a huge counter
[1:40:04] TylerDrake1790: @snowman_sir danke to you as well OhMyDog
[1:40:08] titanodin: @ShellMercs i pulled a shehulk and she isnt as useful as i thought. but maybe i am just not using the right deck
[1:40:13] bobphrapples: you done messed up a a trox
[1:40:23] Shin_gx: White Vision variant in my shop, i didn't know they had it in the game that's cool LUL
[1:40:42] Snowman_Sir: Well, I got a Christmas tree 🎄

[1:41:29] Felgrun: Yeah he's one of the big bads of the lore
[1:41:31] mett7: lets he who got bigger sword Kappa
[1:41:33] RlDennis: If the MMO ever comes out, he might be an actual raid boss. LUL
[1:41:37] Felgrun: Also he's broken in game
[1:41:39] Ageisfang: normal human man vs a gundam, seems balanced
[1:41:43] Fynagle: If you are in the wrong spots in his Q each time, it knocks you up.
[1:42:05] RlDennis: The outer edge of it
[1:42:06] Shoaron: gn everyone ijpNAP
[1:42:08] bobphrapples: walk into the first 2, walk away from the third

[1:43:52] Giant0ctopus: did he say
[1:43:55] Giant0ctopus: 'for great justice
[1:44:17] Fynagle: Depends, he can't get plates off you while you run back, but he gets safe farm.
[1:44:26] bobphrapples: there's a dash
[1:44:33] bobphrapples: he can use them at the same time

[1:45:30] Sekhcellent: !pj
[1:45:32] itmeBOT: PJ is JP's monochrome menace alter ego. He loves competitive games, salt mines and long walks on the beach.
[1:45:45] GassyMexican: How's old PJ? This alter ego I just recently found out about
[1:46:11] bobphrapples: your team is pretty mad, so it might be 15
[1:46:24] GassyMexican: It was 'how's old'
[1:46:25] Sekhcellent: mood
[1:46:28] GassyMexican: as in how's ole
[1:46:31] GassyMexican: how are they
[1:47:50] Ncorbino: Jp how many hours into midnight sons are you
[1:47:52] GassyMexican: Did some OG prop hunt with buds earlier at the top of the broadcast, then more High On Life
[1:47:58] GassyMexican: getting close to finishing it
[1:48:00] hustle21: aatrox is strong right now
[1:48:01] PAEforever: PJ learns Aatrox sounds like a great stream, cause I have no idea how he works either
[1:48:10] blueshiftgaming: Yeah, his R is a rough one in a fight as well, even if you hold your own.
[1:48:21] Ncorbino: Nice! I’m still debating getting it
[1:48:23] cmac1086: Jus
[1:48:50] cmac1086: Just farm only way you make a play now is with tank
[1:49:04] cmac1086: Your still gank*
[1:49:14] bobphrapples: wow a trash talking Taric
[1:49:28] RlDennis: To my knowledge, he has a huge cooldown on his Q early on. I'm not sure if he has any more real weak points
[1:49:36] RlDennis: Yeah, Q removes slows
[1:49:48] malaki_deltorres: you basically just have to dodge his Q early on and then fuck him while its down
[1:49:53] bobphrapples: ganking heim, terrible idea
[1:49:56] Poobzee: if only a third party could lend an advantage
[1:50:20] Deathspate: aatrox warded already so it's not a good gank, he could relieve pressure tho
[1:50:27] bobphrapples: raid boss about to kill everyone mid
[1:50:52] bobphrapples: he even walked over vision
[1:50:55] scruffsgaming: i didn't know you played league
[1:51:37] bobphrapples: tell Taric "nice gank"
[1:51:39] mett7: they dont know PJ
[1:51:41] Mograw: Haven't you always had a strong love hate relationship with league
[1:51:44] bobphrapples: he's really friendly
[1:51:50] Deathspate: Nah, just LoL tbh, we can see you playing OW or Val, not LoL
[1:51:58] Poobzee: what is taric even doing lol
[1:52:00] RlDennis: I don't think it's surprising you like competitive games. I think it's maybe just how negative people have been about League LUL
[1:52:07] scruffsgaming: have you tried high on life yet?
[1:52:08] Daruvik: the best is when they ask if you've ever played Starcraft before
[1:52:45] Ebra: you need whole team to kill aatrax
[1:52:46] Giant0ctopus: tarics ut is strong
[1:52:47] Poobzee: sat in river for a minute for that
[1:52:47] Deathspate: It is, trox ult is down
[1:52:49] Neragsito: not without nerfing his lifesteal
[1:52:49] TheSlyLemon: no where near enough burst to kill aatrox
[1:52:50] scruffsgaming: definitely will have to ignite first
[1:52:54] scruffsgaming: and cc chain
[1:53:01] TheSlyLemon: at the very least you need kindred here too
[1:53:11] bobphrapples: your dodge game is on point tho
[1:53:38] NoorElBahrain: scruffsgaming he did not. Don't think her will
[1:53:58] Snowman_Sir: lack of cc gonna be tough
[1:54:10] Hoodak_Woodak: win chance spotted

[1:54:42] Giant0ctopus: OH SHIT
[1:54:47] jeffhunter12: turret maybe?
[1:54:50] malaki_deltorres: he was taking minion aggro
[1:54:50] TheSlyLemon: walked into turret range '
[1:54:56] Giant0ctopus: outplayed is what happened
[1:54:58] Ebra: you even ulted him with lvl6 instead of lvl11
[1:54:59] loki15kun: I think he got a tower shot to the head
[1:54:59] rypta: lemme help you with the other half
[1:55:04] Deathspate: Trox is very squishy
[1:55:23] NiceGuyNick: oh hey ye apj !
[1:55:32] bobphrapples: recall
[1:55:46] bobphrapples: LuL
[1:55:57] Snowman_Sir: he was not full hp and took 1 tower shot. It was pretty much all you 👍
[1:56:32] bobphrapples: that's better right?
[1:57:21] TheSlyLemon: ignite will make him killable
[1:57:25] jeffhunter12: at this point his lifesteal gets stupid
[1:57:38] Daruvik: need some greivous wounds for him
[1:58:05] Snowman_Sir: he's getting it, build checks out 👍
[1:58:09] bobphrapples: get outta dat ult
[1:58:11] gunstars20: big lifesteal
[1:58:16] ShellMercs: run when he ults
[1:58:26] VioletEden: JP just want to say your league stream are always a joy to watch (both when you are crushing or tilted)
[1:58:29] RlDennis: Isn't ignite's grievous wounds stronger?
[1:58:33] jeffhunter12: yup his ult outdoes grievous
[1:58:38] drwazza: Wow
[1:58:41] Shrimp_Parm: KEKW
[1:58:42] Sonatta: PJSalt
[1:58:45] TheSlyLemon: LUL taric is actually malding
[1:58:47] jeffhunter12: ijpLAUGH
[1:58:50] RlDennis: I think there's levels to grievous wounds, not 100% sure
[1:58:50] Mud__: LUL
[1:58:54] gunstars20: good old league chat
[1:58:55] TDotTerror: 'eat your off dik'
[1:58:57] HeeroMaki: if antrox ults just gotta run.. i hate it, if i didnt have to ban fiora atrox would be my ban
[1:58:59] Shin_gx: KEKW
[1:59:13] TheSlyLemon: LUL
[1:59:17] chippye: lol
[1:59:28] Rodwolt: not the meta! ijpD
[1:59:28] junpei_desu: thank you for reminding me not to play lol again haha
[1:59:37] Mograw: He said yes
[1:59:37] mett7: welcome to the salt mines LUL
[1:59:55] HeeroMaki: i also hate being a top laner lol
[2:00:40] Mograw: What's the strategy for any particular lane?
[2:00:45] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play! JP's Twitch contract has ended, and as a member of the ads incentive program he no longer has precise control over when ads run. Ads will run 6 minutes automatically every hour. As always, subscribing to the channel prevents ads. Thanks! ijpLOVE
[2:01:16] HeeroMaki: depends on the lane lol
[2:01:20] bobphrapples: @Mograw don't die
[2:01:27] TheSlyLemon: that's probably the vaguest question ive seen in a while lol
[2:01:29] Mograw: Is there a difference in what one should do in top vs bottom vs mid?
[2:01:35] TheSlyLemon: yes
[2:01:36] Deathspate: Farm cs, kill enemies, buy items, kill nexus
[2:01:38] Mograw: @TheSlyLemon Not really
[2:01:39] Snowman_Sir: @Mograw get picks on botlane.
[2:01:41] crux_58: @Mograw yup
[2:01:43] Deathspate: That's the strategy, quite easy
[2:01:57] bobphrapples: there are diff strats depending on lane
[2:02:17] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[2:02:44] bobphrapples: it's new
[2:02:44] RlDennis: It's a new mythic
[2:02:52] AN71V1RU5: new this preseason, busted af
[2:02:52] bobphrapples: it'll be nerfed soon
[2:03:11] RlDennis: You basically become tankier the longer you are in a fight
[2:03:12] HeeroMaki: its not good on garen
[2:03:19] HeeroMaki: imo
[2:03:23] RlDennis: (for the first 8 seconds atleast)
[2:03:35] HeeroMaki: the item def needs a nerf tho
[2:03:58] RlDennis: I think it stacks well with his passive on W right? and gets him more time to shred resistances with his E. It shouldn't be.. bad per se
[2:04:00] bobphrapples: LOL
[2:04:00] Snowman_Sir: There you go! cohhCheer
[2:04:11] RlDennis: Not sure if it's the right choice though LUL
[2:04:19] bobphrapples: he's talking shit and JP comes down and poops on his head
[2:04:21] Sardun: Its okayish if they can't burst through it, but then again you always can just build stridebreaker and kill them instead
[2:05:15] TheSlyLemon: pray to god someone CC's him with you
[2:05:17] Snowman_Sir: I like deadman, works against aatrox here, and you can catch squishies perhaps.
[2:05:25] highgroundy: does league still have anathema's
[2:05:27] bobphrapples: no jg is bot
[2:05:34] Snowman_Sir: @highgroundy Nope Sadge

[2:08:46] Koinman25: no. Taric's ult is a circle that makes you invuln when it falls off
[2:08:52] RlDennis: ^
[2:08:54] bobphrapples: team is invincible for a short time
[2:08:55] ObeyTheEgg: his ult gives him big wings and he floats @itmeJP

[2:16:19] NoorElBahrain: typing*
[2:16:36] BrokenSwitch: Man taric really is allergic to his R key
[2:16:38] Wessye: taric died with ult?
[2:17:09] TheSlyLemon: stats dont like
[2:17:11] TheSlyLemon: lie*
[2:17:24] Darkaros: team too heavy Sadge
[2:17:42] Snowman_Sir: taric didn't have ult till the last second, he was cc'ed when he did. :)
[2:17:47] ZarnZeal: The people are nice to me in Valorant
[2:18:02] EvilBuho: I finally hit silver in Valorant, and been having a great time
[2:18:10] VioletEden: I think Garen is also a hard champ to climb with even if you are better than average in your elo
[2:18:39] EvilBuho: Yeah, I keep getting matched with gold playesr
[2:19:03] CrockettsDota: ow2 ranking falls in that shit area lol
[2:19:07] EvilBuho: its crack
[2:19:07] HoodsShadow: why would you want to be in the middle of shit?

[2:19:44] bobphrapples: nothing wrong with Garen
[2:19:47] VioletEden: sorry I didnt mean to sound condescending
[2:19:53] NiceGuyNick: maybe darius?
[2:19:54] AN71V1RU5: garen is great low elo, only hard at like diamond/challenger from what i've heard
[2:19:58] Deno5555: You could instantly suppress people from a screen away
[2:20:03] RlDennis: Early on, I'd really just say whatever you're most comfortable with. Unless that champion just happens to be a dumpster fire at the time
[2:20:07] Snowman_Sir: The player is the best champion. Play him! snowma35Feelschristmasman
[2:20:52] ThatGunsFoHire: Man Pohx's RF Jugg is a real fun build. I've cleared 11x more maps this league than I did last league

[2:22:13] Darkaros: your pc can't run this modlist
[2:22:16] CrockettsDota: oof

[2:22:30] NoorElBahrain: as long as people don't make cat and dog noises for heals I like watching valorant
[2:22:32] ThatGunsFoHire: If no one's can then how were you playing?
[2:22:35] ThatGunsFoHire: Plot holes
[2:22:45] FuzzDBS: meow
[2:22:54] frydragor: Stayed up to 5:30am reloading Minecraft, relatable
[2:23:01] Shin_gx: Same KEKW
[2:23:03] Rodwolt: ijpKEK
[2:23:10] aethybryr: i hate voice chatting with 10 year olds i feel creepy
[2:23:12] Fynagle: "This job would be great if it weren't for the fing customers"
[2:23:18] EvilBuho: Talking to the team makes or breaks games. But I feel you lol, some nights I just dont like talking to them
[2:23:21] Darkaros: talking to them NOPERS making pet noises to them for heals NODDERS
[2:23:21] Papapwnage: Isn't that truly the case with all games? You could stream watching grass if you engage with chat and stuff
[2:23:28] Neragsito: use a mod for your voice
[2:23:40] EvilBuho: I always get someone saying I sound like Kermit the frog nightlight. Like bros
[2:23:41] Neragsito: liek someone is grabbing you by the balls
[2:23:46] Darkaros: become a vtuber just for valorant
[2:23:49] ThatGunsFoHire: PJ needs a Gassito mod
[2:23:51] Papapwnage: You never win 1v1 vs Sett I don't think. I'd just farm it out
[2:23:54] Mud__: LUL
[2:23:56] zSKIz1: No please
[2:24:01] RlDennis: I honestly thought Zeke took over for a second
[2:24:03] Shin_gx: @aethybryr not creepy for me but more often than not it feels like a waste of time and energy lol
[2:24:03] loki15kun: Oh god. That is great LUL
[2:24:15] NiceGuyNick: did I hear Jericho?
[2:24:39] Snowman_Sir: Boop! cohhBoop
[2:24:43] NoorElBahrain: I got the victoria 3 playlist DunkChamp
[2:24:53] RlDennis: Wait, Sett started cull?

[2:25:47] Fateborn: Gang leader I think
[2:25:51] Shin_gx: What happened to doing great PepeHands
[2:25:52] Snowman_Sir: he is an underworld gang leader yes.
[2:25:54] gunstars20: F
[2:25:57] Felgrun: he is the boss of a pit fight club basically
[2:26:09] Secondlast: F
[2:26:25] jopickles28: F ijpCHEER ijpCHEER ijpCHEER ijpCHEER ijpAHH F
[2:26:29] DaHumbleGoose: the 1st rule of fight club is we don't talk about fight club!
[2:27:50] RlDennis: You'd want to use your W just before he pulls you in to reduce cc duration, think that's the only thing you can do?
[2:27:54] RlDennis: But it's a prediction game
[2:28:15] ImNotYourBudde: Sett is giga strong early so a tough matchup for Garen at first
[2:29:17] scruffsgaming: when he pulls you in with e use w and run behind him expecting his W to dodge the true damage
[2:30:45] k0jak: ijpHI
[2:31:00] NoorElBahrain: ijpHI
[2:31:15] Darkaros: ijpHI
[2:31:25] aethybryr: worth
[2:31:29] highgroundy: nice!
[2:31:44] Snowman_Sir: No assist jungler either.
[2:31:48] RlDennis: Didn't give over kayn orbs or assist, so definitely worth
[2:32:37] Sonatta: it's not?
[2:32:42] NiceGuyNick: this is amking me wanna jungle so bad
[2:32:56] RlDennis: Don't Kayn and Garen kinda have similar passives chat?
[2:33:00] RlDennis: Nice W
[2:34:24] twocanspam808: poke him qith Q run
[2:34:33] twocanspam808: bait out his W then go in
[2:34:38] RlDennis: Speaking of, have you ever played Sett?
[2:34:46] twocanspam808: just gotta play safe
[2:34:52] RlDennis: Fair enough LUL
[2:34:56] bairdman: KEKW
[2:35:02] VioletEden: KEKW
[2:35:03] Shrimp_Parm: peepoGiggles
[2:35:05] gunstars20: Fair and honest Garen
[2:35:10] Sonatta: this isn't one of those degenerate league streams chat
[2:36:31] aethybryr: what a stupid fucking character
[2:36:53] HeeroMaki: my answer to sett was to start playing WW vs him lol
[2:37:12] Runforyerlives: so who beats sett anyways?
