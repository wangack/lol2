[1:02:11] inamatuslol: this game does have playoff implications
[1:02:13] ChapoTunelesLocos: A Jeep monitor 🤔
[1:02:22] mujarshad: they are definitely the funnest team in eu, their midlane really hindered them this playoff series though
[1:02:27] inamatuslol: JDG win then they are fourth.
[1:02:37] mujarshad: hopefully exileh can practice more before the qualifier
[1:02:41] hk18810186: 69
[1:03:01] bluestorm1998: Man they pick fast
[1:03:03] mujarshad: i don't understand why teams in eu don't do anything for like 10 mins

[1:03:29] violcncc: thta blindpick Cass so cocky
[1:03:31] mujarshad: doinb is such a beast, their first win this split he cried so much
[1:03:42] cantspeel: hes a softy
[1:03:47] paperboathat_: Exileh is an aggressive player, and if he goes in without support, he looks more shit than other players due to his play style
[1:03:48] mujarshad: and now he has chance to carry them into playoffs
[1:03:49] decco41: HeyGuys KonCha HeyGuys
[1:04:09] bluestorm1998: His Karma was banned throughout most of the split
[1:04:10] MrSleazi: who shed more tears doinb or xspecial?
[1:04:18] mujarshad: @Solairefastora i dunno, his champ pool seems easily targetable :(
[1:04:26] WillTheSage: so many top bans
[1:04:28] bluestorm1998: Guess that's how good it is
[1:04:33] inamatuslol: No, Exileh is just stupid. there's a difference between aggressive and incompetent.
[1:04:48] mattpotter: Predictions?
[1:05:03] CheeseSword: SwiftRage
[1:05:04] paperboathat_: There's a reason he won rookie of the split at one point, he clearly isn't trash
[1:05:04] bluestorm1998: 2-1 JDG
[1:05:06] WillTheSage: @Steadyaimbro seems most picking JDG
[1:05:06] yungfrizzle: $10 says alistair first blood, any takers
[1:05:08] violcncc: Sun draft >>
[1:05:11] paperboathat_: He just needs to tone it back
[1:05:25] based_Atlas: Fast draft
[1:05:34] inamatuslol: yet he hasn't improved his champ pool in a meta with like 8 good picks
[1:05:41] inamatuslol: That's being stupid.
[1:05:47] mujarshad: @itsmyjuly he constantly makes plays, you can call that stupid but i think he plays to win, he doesn't play to not lose
[1:05:48] jungchaeyeon01: dont forget that vizi and hylissang have the worst split ever

[1:06:42] usteeen: bit unfortunate that C9 couldn't close game 4 with baron and 3 inhibs
[1:06:46] inamatuslol: JDG 2-1.
[1:06:51] paperboathat_: Part of the reason Exileh plays so aggressive is if UOL doesn't get a lead, they can't faceroll. It's more a team problem than just Exileh
[1:07:13] WillTheSage: C1-9
[1:07:24] shaun_akuma: Was that a ad for a bottle of something?
[1:07:31] kakelambe: TTours
[1:07:33] mujarshad: @itsmyjuly yeah, i still like him better than most other midlaners that lose an advantage and just slowly grind out a loss
[1:07:34] paperboathat_: They have an aggressive engage style, so they usually draft heavy engage and carries for Visi
[1:07:37] usteeen: that... doesn't make a ton of sense but ok LOL
[1:07:37] Texas__Boss: I already forgot the 2 teams playing
[1:07:42] Texas__Boss: Oh ok
[1:07:45] mujarshad: JDG fight-o VoHiYo
[1:08:12] WillTheSage: why did rakan go spell thiefs over coin?
[1:08:33] paperboathat_: Spell thiefs is better if you don't stay in lane
[1:08:40] mujarshad: depends on masteries, lets wait and see
[1:08:41] shaun_akuma: Cause he's a pro
[1:09:00] paperboathat_: He has to provide early vision pressure to watch for early ganks
[1:09:04] WillTheSage: wow
[1:09:16] mujarshad: NotLikeThis
[1:09:42] WillTheSage: almost mirror masteries
[1:09:57] shaun_akuma: Poppy in 2k17?
[1:10:07] WillTheSage: XDDD
[1:10:11] usteeen: haven't watched a full series of LPL in ages but I'm impressed with how much dom has improved since he was casting NA

[1:10:29] renektonbraveheart: what
[1:10:32] yungfrizzle: someone blind me
[1:10:32] BettingDegen: J4???
[1:10:35] paperboathat_: WTF
[1:10:35] shaun_akuma: Is this bronze?
[1:10:36] WillTheSage: solo queue LUL
[1:10:36] based_Atlas: LUL
[1:10:39] fischflo: wow that was bad....
[1:10:48] yungfrizzle: that hash top lane

[1:11:05] WillTheSage: J4 paid to throw confirmed
[1:11:05] MrSleazi: i thought i was watching lpl not eulcs
[1:11:05] calcil: praying for my boy fury
[1:11:14] BettingDegen: LUL mobis
[1:11:15] Epicsmoky: yapp... pretty bad :)
[1:11:21] vhhush: mobi rush
[1:11:30] BettingDegen: 4min mobis LUL
[1:11:33] paperboathat_: That's a real aggressive build...
[1:11:33] bluestorm1998: LUL
[1:11:34] yungfrizzle: this is really hard to watch
[1:11:35] mujarshad: that must suck so much for little AL, he got body slammed out of range of his e-q combo
[1:11:51] PoliticalMuffin: WHERE IS BANANAFISH?!??!
[1:12:11] mujarshad: they rotate their members
[1:12:16] mujarshad: a few lpl teams do that
[1:12:29] WillTheSage: cute lol
[1:12:33] bluestorm1998: Lots of LPL teams love to use their subs
[1:12:43] goblinguy01: The last two weeks, most teams use subs
[1:12:49] bluestorm1998: Its crazy
[1:12:54] paperboathat_: More teams should have lots of subs
[1:12:59] goblinguy01: There is a rule on subs I believe, they need to play X matches to be legal for next split?
[1:13:18] goblinguy01: It would be unfair to have 10 subs that play 0 games each split
[1:13:19] waddaboss: Where is XiaoWeiXiao
[1:13:28] mujarshad: doinb Kreygasm
[1:13:29] inamatuslol: I think they removed that rule.
[1:13:32] bluestorm1998: LSPL
[1:13:39] goblinguy01: Last time I heard, he was on LSPL
[1:13:41] bilboblaze: jesus were finally done watching random asian women
[1:13:44] bluestorm1998: Challenger version of LPL
[1:13:49] paperboathat_: LPL teams actually have lots of in house subs that aren't even listed on the main roster(I assume)
[1:13:51] goblinguy01: I mean if they had to play 2 games, I think that's fair
[1:14:00] inamatuslol: since SKT hasn't played Sky at all and KT haven't used Ssun either.
[1:14:06] paperboathat_: If it's anything like KR
[1:14:08] inamatuslol: yet both are legal subs.
[1:14:08] waddaboss: How is it that a former NA MVP can't even make a team on LPL??
[1:14:09] mujarshad: rekt 4Head
[1:14:12] fapiuuu: ?
[1:14:13] bluestorm1998: PogChamp doinb
[1:14:18] goblinguy01: They have B rosters and reserved teams, but to be official, you need to play
[1:14:24] paperboathat_: F to pay respects
[1:14:39] goblinguy01: you can have B roster for tier of the LPL
[1:14:40] ligatvliga: thi is Qiao GU - Suning Gaming???
[1:14:45] inamatuslol: maybe in China but that rule applies no where else.
[1:14:58] paperboathat_: JD is basically QG
[1:14:59] bluestorm1998: JDG was previously Qiao Gu
[1:15:11] paperboathat_: Just different orgs
[1:15:11] ligatvliga: thx)
[1:15:12] goblinguy01: They are recruits in their in LPPL and TGA teams :P
[1:15:18] goblinguy01: Streamers and non-playing subs
[1:15:22] mujarshad: NotLikeThis
[1:15:31] deadlygrateful: that gragas zzzzz
[1:15:35] goblinguy01: I believe every team has an Academy team
[1:15:43] goblinguy01: Look at Dota II, LGD and LGD Forever Young
[1:15:53] paperboathat_: PogChamp Mao Pulverize
[1:16:19] mujarshad: ffs, nooooo, why force that
[1:16:35] paperboathat_: It's JD just believe
[1:16:58] inamatuslol: JDG just gonna lose game 1 and win other two.
[1:17:19] paperboathat_: Was corki banned in Champ select?
[1:17:50] mujarshad: I forget bans
[1:17:59] IAmPalOnTheSky: I should have taken @yungfrizzle bet for the Ali fb
[1:18:06] bluestorm1998: Yoon
[1:18:16] bluestorm1998: wow
[1:18:21] paperboathat_: If it was open, I don't see why they wouldn't have taken it
[1:18:23] Menmafuyu: lul
[1:18:27] mujarshad: not worth
[1:18:33] MrSleazi: game of throws
[1:18:37] paperboathat_: Doinb shit on OMG with it yesterday
[1:18:39] Epicsmoky: that greeeeeeed looooooooooooooooooooooooooool
[1:18:39] based_Atlas: FailFish FailFish
[1:18:43] inamatuslol: this is why people don't watch LPL
[1:18:52] paperboathat_: Although OMG did most of the shitting
[1:18:54] mujarshad: ?
[1:19:02] inamatuslol: it's like mechanical enhanced bronze players
[1:19:15] mujarshad: why?
[1:19:20] paperboathat_: More like aggressive fiestas
[1:19:29] inamatuslol: did you not just see what happened?
[1:19:45] inamatuslol: even in EU and NA that was a kill.
[1:19:49] kakelambe: Ikari Shinji ?
[1:19:49] Teemo_Main_Btw: LPL ResidentSleeper
[1:19:51] paperboathat_: That's not why, it's cause LPL is like midnight NA time usually
[1:19:51] nameless_typhlosion: to be fair, this is bottom of the barrel LPL teams
[1:19:53] mujarshad: these are the bottom ranked teams in lpl
[1:20:11] mujarshad: it's like judging lck based on ever8 and rox
[1:20:22] nameless_typhlosion: rox isn't trash tho
[1:20:22] paperboathat_: This is the JD that beat Newbee, OMG, and LGD
[1:20:24] inamatuslol: which would be top LPL teams.
[1:20:29] paperboathat_: Clearly not a shit team
[1:20:32] nameless_typhlosion: it's more ever vs bbq
[1:20:32] mujarshad: no they wouldn't
[1:20:40] mujarshad: yeah sorry bbq
[1:20:49] mujarshad: i forgot the 9th lck team
[1:20:52] paperboathat_: It's just one game, watch the rest before you make a hard judgement
[1:21:00] paperboathat_: ever 8?
[1:21:09] Epicsmoky: all teamy arnt shitty... but some actions are just.... dumb xD. maybe they are just nervous :)
[1:21:15] AIiceMargatroid: Don't forget that NiP managed to also beat Fnatic at one point. Top teams sometimes have a BSoD.
[1:21:21] inamatuslol: pls Vici relegate Suning
[1:21:33] Menmafuyu: lul
[1:21:34] mujarshad: thx for leash :)

[1:22:30] lurkemon: wheres clearlove?
[1:22:37] mujarshad: he's on edg
[1:22:38] nameless_typhlosion: clearlove is still on EDG
[1:22:41] Brunzie: edg
[1:22:45] paperboathat_: Loken has actually been pretty decent
[1:22:45] lurkemon: i see
[1:22:47] vegaeb: lpl is stronger than eu na
[1:23:05] nameless_typhlosion: yeah but loken is still a rookie in china for the most part
[1:23:10] everyoneelseistrash0: LPL > LCK, at least at rift rival
[1:23:12] paperboathat_: Xinyi has also massively improved from the beginning of the split
[1:23:22] mujarshad: yeah, pretty sure top 3 teams in lpl are better than top 3 teams in eu for sure and most likely na
[1:23:29] nameless_typhlosion: they've been getting better but it's probably not enough
[1:23:32] Teemo_Main_Btw: ResidentSleeper

[1:25:06] nameless_typhlosion: I mean the biggest problem with most LPL teams is they literally fight without any purpose behind it these days
[1:25:11] nameless_typhlosion: besides like EDG and stuff
[1:25:12] dancenatic: TriHard TriHard TriHard
[1:25:18] everyoneelseistrash0: RNG > WE > EDG

[1:25:33] Brunzie: TriHard
[1:25:34] inamatuslol: why are they even running Loken?
[1:25:42] AIiceMargatroid: Wasn't "inexplicable aggression" the thing that defined LPL for most of its seasons though?
[1:25:51] mujarshad: yes
[1:26:10] nameless_typhlosion: yeah but they were getting better at fighting with purpose last year at least it seemed
[1:26:12] paperboathat_: Not really, more just team fighting and strong ADCs
[1:26:15] nameless_typhlosion: but I don't know maxyyShrug
[1:26:23] inamatuslol: I'd argue that season 3 and 4 OMG were aggressive and calculated
[1:26:26] based_Atlas: TriHard
[1:26:33] nameless_typhlosion: I haven't watched LPL this year for the most part

[1:35:20] PoliticalMuffin: Do you prefer this clown fest or the do nothing of EF v FLY?
[1:35:26] LMAOKAI88: tarzaned is too toxic to be pro
[1:35:30] mujarshad: @renektonbraveheart ?

[1:35:49] calcil: lpl is more fun to watch than NA tbh
[1:36:01] LMAOKAI88: quas was pro but now he is like santorin and can't get into lcs, he's stuck inCS
[1:36:04] renektonbraveheart: oh i know, im saying skill wise
[1:36:06] bluestorm1998: Quas had depression
[1:36:09] CasterFroskurinn: I find the LPL the most fun region to watch.
[1:36:15] calcil: same
[1:36:18] mujarshad: and quas is still pro, maybe just in LCS
[1:36:19] AIiceMargatroid: Same.
[1:36:23] forgetremembering: same
[1:36:24] calcil: actually lck>lpl
[1:36:31] bluestorm1998: left the pro scene then later came back but wasn't the same since
[1:36:35] mujarshad: yeah, lpl is best to watch, most teams fight a bunch

[1:36:43] AIiceMargatroid: I feel that LPL is the one region that is the most likely to say "fuck it" and go in.
[1:36:43] calcil: but you cant judge a whole region off shite teams playing
[1:36:43] LMAOKAI88: @CasterFroskurinn how do you think LPL will do at worlds this year
[1:36:47] paperboathat_: The amount of raw talent is really exciting to watch develop as well
[1:36:47] forgetremembering: lpl has a more exciting meta to me personally htan lck
[1:36:51] inamatuslol: I too like watching literal monkeys throwing their feces at each other for 30 to 40 minutes
[1:36:58] AIiceMargatroid: Maybe not the "cleanest" LoL but definitely one of the more entertaining.
[1:37:02] inamatuslol: until one learns they don't have to do that and ends it
[1:37:11] forgetremembering: And i love the lpl broadcast because of the technical difficulties Kappa
[1:37:11] calcil: lpl is the most manly LoL
[1:37:12] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: @CasterFroskurinn Ya clown fiesta regions are most fun to watch.
[1:37:13] CasterFroskurinn: If the tank meta persists, I think the LPL will be fine at Worlds because this meta covers their lackluster vision control.
[1:37:26] galvatorex34: TSM HONESTLY IS SAME LEVEL AS SKT RIGHT NOW PogChamp
[1:37:34] renektonbraveheart: that was the worst call
[1:37:39] renektonbraveheart: kalista was toplane
[1:37:42] calcil: also some of the star lpl players have baller attitudes
[1:37:42] mujarshad: they tried the DAN strategy 4Head
[1:37:44] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn if JD somehow makes worlds, do you think they could make it work?
[1:37:49] PapaSmithy: If you can run Sivir and Maokai and feel good about it, China is a threat
[1:38:00] nameless_typhlosion: isn't the DAN strategy to replace your entire roster in one split?
[1:38:13] CasterFroskurinn: I doubt JDG will make worlds in their current condition.
[1:38:16] inamatuslol: let's let JD make playoffs first
[1:38:19] deadlygrateful: @papasmithy i love you man great cast last night
[1:38:45] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn also, hey, it's been a while! KonCha
[1:38:51] LMAOKAI88: it should be illegal to get excited about KT
[1:39:04] AIiceMargatroid: I mean the meta kinda has been shifting toward "takes your entire team and throw it at the enemy" with the prevalence of tanks and stuff like Sivir, so it kinda suits the LPL's desire to always go in.
[1:39:05] violcncc: worlds? they won't make playoffs FailFish
[1:39:13] maquee1: DansGame
[1:39:14] nameless_typhlosion: I knew if KT lost one game they'd lose the series
[1:39:16] renektonbraveheart: wtf are these
[1:39:17] paperboathat_: A man can dream
[1:39:20] deadlygrateful: it should be illegal to get excited about SKT losing
[1:39:21] nameless_typhlosion: KT are too emotional of a team
[1:39:26] mujarshad: does jdg know how scuttle works?
[1:39:39] CasterFroskurinn: My producer was teasing me last night during the SKT vs KT set. I was betting on SKT and poking fun at KT fans for getting excited. He teased me when KT went up 2/0. Suddenly he got real quiet
[1:39:43] inamatuslol: I knew KT would lose when SKT was established
[1:39:46] PapaSmithy: I predicted whoever won game 1 would win the series FeelsBadMan

[1:39:58] uqcm: rip
[1:40:05] renektonbraveheart: why are they forcing baron
[1:40:08] CasterFroskurinn: I'm a historian, Papa. History tells me that SKT will always win.
[1:40:13] AIiceMargatroid: They say that Score signed a contract with the devil that allowed him to be an excellent jungler but always be denied any type of tournament win.
[1:40:18] nameless_typhlosion: pretty much lol
[1:40:19] violcncc: God bless that doinb absurd ends now Kreygasm
[1:40:19] lightpinoy: why so noob JGD

[1:40:55] PapaSmithy: Xiao translates to little

[1:41:15] PapaSmithy: its not hard to say and it sounds cool
[1:41:23] AIiceMargatroid: Well wait a second. Let's consider something for a second if we're counting past trends in history.
[1:41:24] nameless_typhlosion: I mean I feel like china has a decent shot to make quarters with at least 2 teams
[1:41:24] CasterFroskurinn: Rekt? CN still has the best results at internationals historically outside korea.
[1:41:32] xQueso: @PapaSmithy so toxic
[1:41:37] nameless_typhlosion: if not more
[1:41:40] galvatorex34: JENSEN = NA CROWN PogChamp
[1:41:45] AIiceMargatroid: A long time ago, a wildcard got an upset when Kabum beat Alliance.
[1:41:49] calcil: @CasterFroskurinn when is jackeylove of age to play?
[1:41:55] CasterFroskurinn: November
[1:41:55] AIiceMargatroid: Then more wildcards got tournament wins in the following year.

[1:44:09] TruxBlue: OOOOOOO
[1:44:11] CasterFroskurinn: MSI 2015 was EDG
[1:44:11] BettingDegen: HOLY SHT DOINB
[1:44:12] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: @ZCanuck People probably take into account EU has gotten lucky with draws and havn't had to face hard regions, and then at the same time they got horribly embarrassed at Rift
[1:44:12] balde_runner: !!!
[1:44:14] EvasionEvo: 4Head
[1:44:15] bluestorm1998: JDG win SwiftRage

[1:44:35] paperboathat_: VaultBoy HAVE TO DO ALL THE DAMAGE BY MYSELF VaultBoy
[1:44:36] CasterFroskurinn: MSI 2016 was RNG vs SKT and took a game off them in semis efore CLG vs SKT 3/0
[1:44:36] PapaSmithy: Is it 7.15 this week?
[1:44:46] AI_Logic: yea
[1:44:51] ZCanuck: oh no doubt EU got hit hard with the luck stick over the last two years at worlds with H2K and I think Origen not facing a single KR team till semis
[1:44:58] razlol: yes
[1:44:59] greenmachine06: yes 7.15
[1:44:59] edgelordweeb: @itsmyjuly no because that was a gpl team at the time so it can be counted as lms or gpl
[1:45:03] mujarshad: this is like every jdg, doinb carries late game 4Head
[1:45:14] mattpotter: What does the baron buff do I've never played before
[1:45:30] paperboathat_: JD literally win games by whether Doinb lives the fight
[1:45:36] AIiceMargatroid: Extra AP and AD, decreased recall time, empowered minions.
[1:45:41] mujarshad: @Steadyaimbro it makes minions stronger and gives some stats
[1:45:48] mattpotter: Ok thanks
[1:45:54] pineapple_on_pizza: did skt win or loose?

[1:49:21] inamatuslol: I mean chess is pure strategy
[1:49:25] AIiceMargatroid: It's entertaining in the same way that watching a Bronze flash into a wall and miss their ult is entertaining.
[1:49:26] mujarshad: jdg had it NotLikeThis
[1:49:27] TruxBlue: mmorpgHello
[1:49:29] inamatuslol: you find that entertaining?
[1:49:31] AIiceMargatroid: It's so bad it's good.
[1:49:36] wei309glwrgt: these teams have my brain flipped PogChamp
[1:49:46] MrSleazi: No one fails their flash better than Faker
[1:49:52] PoliticalMuffin: I'm pretty sure the next logical step for Suning is to sub in Bananafish now
[1:49:56] deadlygrateful: so bronze is more entertaining than watching good players?
[1:49:57] AIiceMargatroid: Don't get me wrong clean LoL is lit as fuck, but sometimes I also wanna see a bunch of people just completely drop the ball.
[1:50:01] CasterFroskurinn: The idea that LPL is one giant fiesta is played up a bit by the casters for fun, and while these two teams are on the lower spectrum of strategy for the LPL. There are far more top teams in the LPL this split that actually have rather impressive strategies.
[1:50:17] Biglebowski54: nice one
[1:50:24] wei309glwrgt: WE usually plays pretty cleanly, tbh
[1:50:27] AIiceMargatroid: Well yes that too. This is the bottom of the table so it's not like we're expecting miracles.
[1:50:33] CasterFroskurinn: But the LPL is not as bad as everyone jokes. There's a reason its remained a threat for so long.
[1:50:35] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: Except both these teams are in contention for playoffs, lol.
[1:50:37] mujarshad: @deadlygrateful how are these players not good? did you watch this game?
[1:50:43] deadlygrateful: but not in competitive play if i want to watch monkeys ill watch qtpie
[1:50:45] AIiceMargatroid: Like, this is complaining that NiP vs MM wasn't some amazing strategfest.
[1:50:50] rshawer99: Guys what did you expect from the 10th to 11th place team
[1:51:00] CasterFroskurinn: The LPL has more teams than any other region and takes more teams into playoffs than any other region
[1:51:05] deadlygrateful: ya did you lol that was a fucking clown fest
[1:51:06] CasterFroskurinn: these teams are competing for the final spot into playoffs
[1:51:06] inamatuslol: LPL also benefits from every region outside of LCK being garbage.
[1:51:24] AIiceMargatroid: Well in 2 to 4 games we'll see the higher end of the table. It's not really fair to dismiss LPL based on their lower end team.
[1:51:29] rshawer99: In what region are those games good, even BBQ vs bottom feeder lck team is a pretty big fiesta
[1:51:30] deadlygrateful: they backed and reset they won instead the ran into a brick wall and died.... bronze gameplay
[1:51:35] AIiceMargatroid: I mean if we judged NA by Dig v Ren you'd be wondering why these wildcards were here.
[1:51:37] CasterFroskurinn: So the statement: but these are playoff teams still doesn't account for the other six teams that are quite solid in playoffs and the region
[1:51:42] mujarshad: the players are good... they didn't have the best of strategy...
[1:51:42] AmazingSalvia: tbh fighting for objectives > playing the pve waiting game
[1:51:43] Taag69: jingdong? more like ding dongs lmao
[1:52:09] AIiceMargatroid: (besides we all know skt is gonna win in the end anyway ayyyy lmao :^) )
[1:52:15] ZCanuck: I wish there was a tourney like the NIT in college basketball so all the teams that dont make worlds can face each other, would be fun to see who comes out on top
[1:52:25] deadlygrateful: i love a bloody game but that was just ignorant kill trades nothing competitive about it
[1:52:25] calcil: i wonder how vasilliis new nun lifestyle is working out for him
[1:52:26] wei309glwrgt: i'd say that P1 played promotionals better
[1:52:28] CasterFroskurinn: Currently WE and SKT are 2:2
[1:52:31] AIiceMargatroid: Oh god. I would KILL for a bottom of the table Worlds.
[1:52:33] chrysopelea: LMS is on PogChamp
[1:52:37] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: The statement stands. The fact the LPL has stupid formatting is their own fault.
[1:52:45] calcil: BlessRNG
[1:52:48] chrysopelea: sixth team for worlds might be decided tonight boys
[1:52:52] Taag69: wow suddenly I want to purchase a jeep
[1:52:56] Juli_xx: orange jeep PogChamp
[1:53:01] CasterFroskurinn: The LPL has great formatting! So much talent and great development of that talent
[1:53:05] AIiceMargatroid: Such subtle advertising. :^)
[1:53:06] inamatuslol: has Vasili even played since going abstinent?
[1:53:18] rshawer99: I have never seen a good game from bottom tier teams from any region including Korea
[1:53:21] calcil: I dont know
[1:53:21] mujarshad: yeah, lpl is the only league that has lots of teams that use subs
[1:53:28] AIiceMargatroid: MVP are minions.
[1:53:31] ZCanuck: arent they overhauling the format next year with their form of franchising?
[1:53:40] CasterFroskurinn: NALCS fans complain that there's not enough NA talent being developed. That problem doesn't exist in the LPL. The region has developed all sorts of new talent this split: Hudie, Ming, Kabe, LWX, iBoy to name only a few
[1:53:44] BlazingHigh: LPL LUL BrokeBack
[1:53:53] CasterFroskurinn: And that development is in a big part based on the format
[1:53:54] calcil: @caster who do you think will win lspl?
[1:53:59] wei309glwrgt: ever8's promotional games were also reasonably high level
[1:53:59] CasterFroskurinn: Vici
[1:54:16] deadlygrateful: so these teams are the equivalent of like NV RNG or any EU team you can think of?
[1:54:30] deadlygrateful: NRG*
[1:54:30] FishRoeSoup: golden Kappa check
[1:54:37] AIiceMargatroid: These bottom teams? Yeah.
[1:54:38] mujarshad: frosk, how many teams does lms get to worlds?
[1:54:40] trblestrife: when is next game??
[1:54:50] AIiceMargatroid: (also NV is actually decent this year)
[1:54:52] lukejychen: 中國裡面是狗還是猴? 狗會隨地大小便但猴子才會翻牆
[1:54:54] trblestrife: plz anyone?
[1:54:54] DeeTenD10: 🤘 SwiftRage
[1:54:58] Taag69: lms has 2 + 1 through qualifier
[1:55:03] calcil: do you think young miracles will ever get promoted?
[1:55:18] calcil: i guess with the new format they must eventually
[1:55:19] AIiceMargatroid: Uhh... I'd say somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes, @trblestrife.
[1:55:21] deadlygrateful: NV hardstuck lul
[1:55:22] mujarshad: no these teams are equivalent to flyquest, as you saw
[1:55:25] CasterFroskurinn: No. I am saying that of the top six teams in the LPL, they actually aren't as braindead as people joke. I know we joke about the teams as a brand - but the idea that LPL teams are just braindead fiestas is untrue. That can be seen in their international results historically. They've always been a threat, even when they have low or dissapointing years when examined collectively.
[1:55:32] AIiceMargatroid: The intermissions in LCK and LPL are generally longer.
[1:55:47] CasterFroskurinn: Our intermissions are actually shorter than LCK by a wide margin.
[1:55:55] CasterFroskurinn: 2-3 minutes
[1:55:59] calcil: since 2015 people have memed so much about lpl
[1:56:01] AIiceMargatroid: Ah. mb
[1:56:04] andbladu: damn
[1:56:11] mujarshad: yeah lpl intermissions are like lcs
[1:56:12] ProphetofChud: How likely is it for LGD to beat OMG?
[1:56:13] CasterFroskurinn: People meme because they don't actually watch the LPL and talk out their ass about the region.
[1:56:14] AIiceMargatroid: Generally I lose track of time for the intermissions since I'm watching these at the middle of the night. RIP
[1:56:15] calcil: people act like lpl were not even a threat at s5 worlds
[1:56:18] andbladu: where is pentakill music
[1:56:25] whatsupimbear: edg is going to win worlds
[1:56:26] mujarshad: lck is only league that has like 20 min break between games
[1:56:31] andbladu: BabyRage
[1:56:32] whatsupimbear: Keepo
[1:56:33] GummiGrim: @jasonparanoia The ADC player?
[1:56:39] PulseIRL: Jesus, I walk into Chat and Frosk is laying down the law Kreygasm
[1:56:40] cantspeel: THEY SHOULD KNOW BY NOW now now now
[1:56:48] cantspeel: TURN MY MUSIC UP CmonRaz
[1:56:51] chrysopelea: LPL only league with cheerleaders
[1:56:51] AmazingSalvia: and 1 hour if its a 2-0 LUL
[1:56:52] mujarshad: @jasonparanoia ye, he's on rng
[1:56:53] deadlygrateful: im not particularly saying LPL I was just referring to the last dew minutes of that game I just tuned in. Could have passed for a challenger team
[1:56:54] AIiceMargatroid: I mean if LPL *wasn't* a threat then they wouldn't consistently get to semis or higher.
[1:56:58] AmazingSalvia: the 1st match*
[1:57:01] AIiceMargatroid: lol
[1:57:03] CasterFroskurinn: Some days I wake up and I think: I am tried of the memes. And some days I just say: let it all burn.
[1:57:07] ZCanuck: speaking of memes, please papa talk to the OGN studio crew and let them know of Silver Scrapes, 100k were sad last night before game 5
[1:57:17] AIiceMargatroid: We just said these were bottom barrel teams. It's gonna be pretty awful tbh.
[1:57:22] trblestrife: @AIiceMargatroid thankyou :)
[1:57:29] cantspeel: Froskos Here, Hide the MEMES BrokeBack
[1:57:30] mujarshad: @CasterFroskurinn are the days you want it to all burn the day that DAN plays? Keepo
[1:57:34] PulseIRL: We need more cheerleaders 1 Kappa = 1 Vote
[1:57:34] CasterFroskurinn: Yes
[1:57:42] reioli: Kappa
[1:57:46] nameless_typhlosion: Kappa
[1:57:46] AIiceMargatroid: Wait one or two hours and wait for the next batch. Quality isn't gonna improve magically.
[1:57:47] mujarshad: 4Head
[1:57:52] cantspeel: Hide the Memes, mods and frosk WutFace
[1:57:54] AIiceMargatroid: I mean they didn't get to 10th and 11th because they were being paid off.
[1:57:56] afrojason: Kappa
[1:58:06] deadlygrateful: ya but even bottom tier NA EU teams dont play like monkeys until theres 60 kills in 40 minutes...
[1:58:11] whatsupimbear: wait wait wait doinb can still make playoffs PogChamp
[1:58:11] Ilno: Memes 🤔
[1:58:11] reioli: Memes are dreams, nothing else
[1:58:18] PulseIRL: Dad Rusty PogChamp
[1:58:20] Taag69: opl more viewers FeelsBadMan
[1:58:27] 0dd__: just burn the NA this EU that memes, i'm so sick of them ResidentSleeper
[1:58:29] deadlygrateful: not usually ive seen it but not typical
[1:58:38] mujarshad: @deadlygrateful yeah, lets farm for 20 minutes instead of trying to be prooactive
[1:58:44] mujarshad: so fun to watch
[1:58:48] AIiceMargatroid: iunno, there was Dig and Ren like I like to remember. Also, you could argue that "boring everyone to death" is equally as inept.
[1:59:01] PoliticalMuffin: wait are OMG in?? I can't recall the last time they won
[1:59:01] deadlygrateful: your low elo is shining bright bud
[1:59:06] AIiceMargatroid: A team that does nothing does not make itself better than a team that goes for a silly play. It just means they did nothing.
[1:59:59] FishRoeSoup: that reminds me of eu lcs one time the crowd yelled 'fight u fking puzzies' Kappa
[2:00:03] mujarshad: i don't care, even in lck they try stuff, eu farms for 20 mins
[2:00:10] mujarshad: how is that good
[2:00:11] AIiceMargatroid: Also late but hey @RiotPulse. There's still some EU fans that miss you. :(
[2:00:38] mujarshad: @RiotPulse is the Rush hour casting set 2? Keepo
[2:00:40] CasterFroskurinn: Loken is in tears
[2:01:01] AIiceMargatroid: Clearly the solution is to pick Amumu adc.
[2:01:07] CasterFroskurinn: Watching DoinB cry after his first win with this squad, watching him take down swift and bow to xinyi, watching Lokken grip his shirt and have tears in his eyes
[2:01:08] PulseIRL: @AIiceMargatroid Well too bad because I'm out BUH BYE Kappa
[2:01:15] deadlygrateful: ive heard froskurrrin mention it and it was a strategy that sun tzu speaks of in art of war....you do not have to fight your enemies to win a war..... sorry you boys dont like it but league is a game of strategy
[2:01:19] AIiceMargatroid: :(
[2:01:22] CasterFroskurinn: there are such powerful narratives in the LPL that unfortunetly don't get the spotlight they deserve
[2:01:29] PulseIRL: Rush hour is actually casting set 2, yes
[2:01:34] PulseIRL: PogChamp TriHard
[2:01:48] mujarshad: doinb in playoffs BlessRNG
[2:02:00] mujarshad: RUSH HOUR PogChamp
[2:02:11] vikki45: thats what i'd like to see
[2:02:13] nako_tako: @deadlygrateful why dont you go play LPL and see how you do...
[2:02:14] AIiceMargatroid: Not dismissing EU's start. Farming to late isn't bad and honestly it's let them get some real advantages. Really it's unfair to dismiss an entire region since the wide diversity of strategy that each region brings keeps Worlds fresh and exciting.
[2:02:20] nako_tako: its a game of strat and execution
[2:02:23] Ilno: Doublelift and Aphromoo are casting game 2 ? PogChamp
[2:02:26] ZCanuck: dg, the game 4 from last night between skt and kt such a great example, only 8 kills from skt, it was just skt rotating and suffocating kt all game
[2:02:27] inamatuslol: Yes league is a strategy game
[2:02:35] mujarshad: uh oh
[2:02:40] inamatuslol: but believe it or not you're not gonna win a professional game by being a pacifist
[2:02:42] mujarshad: fenfen kass NotLikeThis
[2:02:49] AIiceMargatroid: Also let's be honest here. The bottom tier EU teams aren't playing 4D chess when they stall. Sometimes the macro just isn't that good.
[2:02:49] deadlygrateful: lul
[2:02:50] CasterFroskurinn: That's actually how a lot of Korea approaches the game
[2:02:55] PapaSmithy: I miss Pulse IRL FeelsBadMan
[2:02:56] deadlygrateful: k boys
[2:02:59] CasterFroskurinn: SKT are commented that their drafts are sometimes too defensive
[2:03:02] wei309glwrgt: EU's strats make them especially weak to the KR high speed execution, however, imho
[2:03:08] AIiceMargatroid: That's just really the reality of bottom tier teams more than regions though tbh.
[2:03:11] Hi_ImPhantomere: @CasterFroskurinn who would win kt or EDG?
[2:03:19] nako_tako: go watch some LCK or EU rebroadcasts brotha
[2:03:21] CasterFroskurinn: but they do that because a belief is held that if you mess up less than your opponent you can win by punishing instead of opening yourself up to punishment
[2:03:26] honeybakedlegs: he should shit on kass
[2:03:34] AIiceMargatroid: KT wins unless it's a Finals, then they lose. :^)
[2:03:36] ZCanuck: you mean like the 4 tanks and a trist from game 2 last night Frosk?
[2:03:38] whatsupimbear: u dont necessarily have to kill people to be considered aggro
[2:03:49] Gh0stStyle: @CasterFroskurinn punish me Kreygasm
[2:03:50] mujarshad: @honeybakedlegs i see you haven't watched fenfen kass
[2:03:51] deadlygrateful: @casterfroskurinn i agree with you but i guess if both teams feed than noone has a true advantage
[2:03:57] nameless_typhlosion: @CasterFroskurinn so it's like judo? 🤔
[2:03:57] mujarshad: dude always finds random kills early game
[2:04:07] MrSleazi: An then SKT brings in Blank and they magically win
[2:04:12] inamatuslol: SKT has basically inted games but win off of objectives
[2:04:14] deadlygrateful: ya and get shit on twitch chat froskurrin agreed with me
[2:04:19] CasterFroskurinn: @Hi_ImPhantomere Pawn and Deft are just as inconsistent to judge as Scout and Mouse. It's pretty much a: who shows on the day? I don't think EDG have the ceiling to match KT if both team's play their best. But does EDG play their best more often than KT? That's the actual probability in guessing who wins
[2:04:21] inamatuslol: so clearly even if you feed you can win
[2:04:23] o_buffalo: blank + corki = win
[2:04:50] AIiceMargatroid: ... I thought we were just establishing that bottom tier teams are poor examples of a region.
[2:04:58] Hi_ImPhantomere: @CasterFroskurinn thnx! R) <3
[2:05:08] AirborneAce: cant watch opl, tgun losing breaks my heart :(
[2:05:20] AIiceMargatroid: RIP
[2:05:22] vikki45: @CasterFroskurinn will you be casting today? <3
[2:05:26] mujarshad: @AirborneAce so every week then? 4Head
[2:05:31] CasterFroskurinn: I am casting the last series: NB vs RNG
[2:05:32] whatsupimbear: @CasterFroskurinn if u could rearrange lpl roster how would u create your favorite team?
[2:05:38] fanrlanz: OPL Lmao
[2:05:42] AirborneAce: yep :(
[2:05:50] inamatuslol: who's your pick for Newbee vs RNG?
[2:05:50] draheriii: How does KT make it to worlds at this point?
[2:05:55] mini_wheatx: yay frosk!
[2:06:02] mujarshad: at least they won a game this time 4Head
[2:06:02] vikki45: sweet
[2:06:03] fanrlanz: i just saw the greed play from shen
[2:06:06] inamatuslol: KT I believe need to win vs SKT
[2:06:07] ZCanuck: kt makes world by SKT winning summer or KT wins regionals
[2:06:12] inamatuslol: and then play one bo5 at the gauntlet
[2:06:22] AIiceMargatroid: @DraherIII Pretty easily, actually. They have a bunch of points. They'll be fine if SKT wins.
[2:06:27] AIiceMargatroid: Even if SKT loses they get the gauntlet.
[2:06:32] jeremysbt: how is RNG now?
[2:06:34] draheriii: Thank god
[2:06:35] deadlygrateful: what I was honestly referring to is that you xan potentially win a game with very little kills by outmaneuvering the enemy it also depends on the comp you build sometimes you want to fight sometimes you want to win through split pushing. It just seems like LPL is more of a ARAM run it down mid region
[2:06:44] draheriii: I'm scared c9 won't make it
[2:06:46] paarthurnaks61: Froskurinn what u think bout this comps who will win u think?
[2:06:48] mujarshad: @DraherIII if skt wins lck, kt goes to worlds
[2:06:51] draheriii: And I need someone to root for
[2:07:04] wei309glwrgt: C9 is going home early :(
[2:07:05] whatsupimbear: ssg is going to beat kt in gauntlet 3-2 i read the script
[2:07:07] AIiceMargatroid: As a C9 fan I'm similarly worried for them. :(
[2:07:11] mujarshad: ty mods VoHiYo
[2:07:12] MrSleazi: stop trying to distract Frosk she gonna trip over the cables an jack the stream again
[2:07:12] Yawza: c9 is out
[2:07:28] mujarshad: no
[2:07:30] CasterFroskurinn: 957ClearloveXiaohuMysticFiveIs the team I would build of any of the LPL players currently.
[2:07:30] AIiceMargatroid: I think C9 still has the gauntlet, right?
[2:07:31] draheriii: C9 can win gauntlet
[2:07:32] KptBoredom: if c9 doesn't make worlds i'm just gonna chill and enjoy the games
[2:07:32] mujarshad: c9 has to go through gauntlet
[2:07:38] deadlygrateful: c9 is out of summer not worlds zzzz
[2:07:42] Ilno: C9 still got gauntlets
[2:07:42] o_buffalo: idc who goes to worlds i just want high level games Jebaited
[2:07:43] nako_tako: @deadlygrateful i agree with that lolol, not that lpl is braindead monkeys tho haha
[2:07:48] CasterFroskurinn: They've tapped my to my chair - I can no longer kill cables XD
[2:07:53] wei309glwrgt: yeah C9 must win gauntlet now...
[2:07:53] mujarshad: @CasterFroskurinn nice spacing WutFace
[2:07:57] KptBoredom: c9 has gauntlet which they've won before. they made worlds despite being a 7th place team in regular season
[2:08:01] Taag69: XD
[2:08:02] AIiceMargatroid: lol
[2:08:05] whatsupimbear: @CasterFroskurinn my team would be doinb x5 or old QG
[2:08:09] draheriii: Would love to see tsm clg c9
[2:08:13] CasterFroskurinn: I loved old QG
[2:08:14] Yawza: c9 is the only team i like BibleThump
[2:08:18] AIiceMargatroid: @KptBoredom In fairness they had THE SHOTCALLING GOD HAI on their side for that.
[2:08:22] DaveElBarbarisimo: Today will be LCK?
[2:08:24] TriHard_up_a_tree: PogChamp
[2:08:30] shalibur: @Riotpulse can you give me tips on how to style my hair like yours i always wanted to cosplay sonic the hedgehog
[2:08:35] deadlygrateful: @nako_tako i never said LPL i said the end of that last game was similar to low elo mistakes they overstated and fought instead of resetting
[2:08:38] mujarshad: ???????
[2:08:43] Lanolinlol: D: ?
[2:08:45] xcpn: lul
[2:08:45] paarthurnaks61: froskurinn, who will win u think bout this match
[2:08:46] CasterFroskurinn: They have to get this blue for this to be worth
[2:08:46] 123Meerkat: lul
[2:08:46] deadlygrateful: overstayed*
[2:08:47] AIiceMargatroid: Well that was awkward.

[2:08:48] Fragic1905: LUL
[2:08:48] DanteMasamune: LPL LUL
[2:08:49] inamatuslol: I'd like to change my prediction
[2:08:50] KptBoredom: @AIiceMargatroid i believe in the dream
[2:08:51] CasterFroskurinn: otherwise they lose so much time
[2:08:56] Lanolinlol: my eyes monkaS
[2:08:58] inamatuslol: to 2-0 SNG
[2:08:58] TheVern: fiieeessstttaaa
[2:09:05] DaveElBarbarisimo: We will have LCK today?
[2:09:05] KptBoredom: sneakyW
[2:09:09] AIiceMargatroid: Someone call Ekko then, because no blue secure.
[2:09:10] CasterFroskurinn: Win for JDG becasue it's a health bonus to Jarvan and he's going aggro top
[2:09:12] mujarshad: no lck today
[2:09:20] DaveElBarbarisimo: Tnx
[2:09:23] whatsupimbear: doesnt both junglers being behind benefit jdg because winning lanes
[2:09:24] Zenoarks: @casterfroskurinn how do you feel abt skt vs lz and ur predictions? :)
[2:09:30] mujarshad: there is lms though
[2:09:32] AIiceMargatroid: Yeah.
[2:09:42] AIiceMargatroid: And Hacker's now getting forced off of blue.
[2:09:44] CasterFroskurinn: I watch more LMS than LCK so I'm bad at offering any sort of LCK predictions.
[2:09:48] TriHard_up_a_tree: LUL H4CKER
[2:09:48] mujarshad: LOOOOOOOOOl
[2:09:49] wei309glwrgt: LZ 3-1 SKT, you heard it right here :)
[2:09:51] Taag69: PogChamp
[2:10:15] CasterFroskurinn: But see, a play like that can be sold as a LUL or it can be sold as planned and executed advs that have actually be gained by JDG
[2:10:17] AIiceMargatroid: @wei309glwrgt Nah, LZ will go 2-0 and then Faker will stop trolling around.
[2:10:17] whatsupimbear: DOINB
[2:10:17] inamatuslol: I mean you could just predict SKT and you'd probably be right
[2:10:22] TriHard_up_a_tree: chiNA LULL
[2:10:23] inamatuslol: it's like a 90% chance at this point
[2:10:23] mujarshad: DOINB PogChamp
[2:10:40] whatsupimbear: maybe blind kass isnt the best pick LUL
[2:10:41] AngieFoxtrot: Frosk do you have a bet riding on LGD this split?
[2:10:42] Taag69: D Kreygasm I N B
[2:10:54] CasterFroskurinn: @AngieFoxtrot I backed off that bus real quick
[2:10:56] papasullyc: Is fury imp?
[2:11:13] CasterFroskurinn: Fury is from SSG and Prime Optimus from LCK
[2:11:15] whatsupimbear: fury is fury
[2:11:15] LUDICR0USS: @CasterFroskurinn Who has more advantage for the lategame?
[2:11:15] inamatuslol: no
[2:11:16] AIiceMargatroid: Well SNG at least has bot lane going for them.
[2:11:22] inamatuslol: imp is imp

[2:12:21] mattpotter: PogChamp
[2:12:22] wei309glwrgt: looked just like Faker! PogChamp
[2:12:26] CasterFroskurinn: In my opinion, JDG. I think that a lot of SNG's comp wants to dive into the back line with the kassadin or Zac, but that's where Xayah really thrives - people diving back into her. And JDG comp also has a more bridging powers for early and mid game spikes and can match scaling late.
[2:12:28] inamatuslol: this is like UOL vs MSF again

[2:13:09] CasterFroskurinn: They just don't match on range - so if the comps draw a line in the sand and run front to back at each other, Trist's range will win out. But I don't think the fights will be executed like that. I think SNG will dive backlines without proper back up and lose key members before their team can act on it

[2:14:46] mattpotter: JDG should've never lost 1st map if they don't make silly mistakes like that again it should go to 3rd at least

[2:17:35] CasterFroskurinn: You can play a game with Dom where you "throw" the analogy and he'll always go and get it. So you try to think of some ridiculous analogy and watch him process how to work it together
[2:17:37] papasullyc: I know this is the LPL but I cannot believe C9 threw game 4 today

[2:24:51] mujarshad: 4Head
[2:24:56] AIiceMargatroid: @Regrup Sjokz is just absent from the past couple of EU LCS casts. Internet being Internet, first assumption is that he's dead.

[2:31:10] AIiceMargatroid: Jesus how was a Trist caught out and somehow take no damage from it?
[2:31:23] inamatuslol: because Loken just got 2 items
[2:31:24] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora Zac isn't a high priority for the LPL on this patch after the nerfs and the higher priority of Elise to punish early in the jungle. So while Zac is still strong in the 5v5; he's no longer the outright best option.
[2:31:27] whatsupimbear: in lane it would camera would pan to him getting chunked every minute
[2:31:36] paperboathat_: @hyrule13 at least Cho is fucked if he doesn't snowball, Zac has way too much to offer from both behind and ahead
[2:31:37] ZCanuck: if youre going to leave zac open, you should be getting something great for it an di m not sure any of the camps jdg have qualify for that

[2:32:23] whatsupimbear: wait does doinb get relegated if he loses this?
[2:32:26] esshun: KUBE PogChamp
[2:32:31] CasterFroskurinn: Myabe that'll change after KT vs SKT and teams will pick him back up, but leading up to these games he was absent in a lot of bans and picks
[2:32:34] whatsupimbear: how does lpl relegations work?
[2:32:44] AIiceMargatroid: @unlivingphoton They lose a chance at playoffs.
[2:32:50] mujarshad: @unlivingphoton it's possible
[2:32:51] CasterFroskurinn: There are no relegation in LPL
[2:32:55] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn I thought long range engage would suit the LPL perfectly, why has priority fallen off?

[2:33:13] Gunerdrag: Kreygasm Frosk Kreygasm <3
[2:33:25] CasterFroskurinn: LPL like to abuse Zac with early game junglers with heavy invades - like what was done this game over the blue.
[2:33:28] xayah_for_dinner: wait so LPL is franchised now?
[2:33:30] mattpotter: gg

[2:34:46] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora Naturally. I think Zac is still strong, but there are options that these teams feel are viable. So, at least in this region, he wasn't seen as the be all end all. Maybe that changes after KT vs SKT - gloabally teams were paying attention to that series
[2:34:48] AIiceMargatroid: That throw in game 1.
[2:34:53] AIiceMargatroid: Or that cask in game 2.
[2:34:55] cantspeel: rip my speedracer doinb BibleThump
[2:34:59] esshun: Xinyl's gragas was horrendous
[2:35:01] CasterFroskurinn: Sad day for JDG but huge congrats to SNG
[2:35:04] CasterFroskurinn: now it's up to OMG
[2:35:18] Toto___otoT: True.
[2:35:18] paperboathat_: @sullyc2323 Iverns entire game is around stealing buffs and camps through cheese, junglers have learned to path to counter
[2:35:19] cantspeel: @xPekeIsG0d lpl
[2:35:28] WhoKnowsUA: Classic Riot, nerf Cait to see Tristana on top so in a few patches she will be nerfed too and completely forgotten for an about a year AGAIN
[2:35:30] mujarshad: xinyi decided to int when he realized he might have to play more games in playoffs 4Head
[2:35:31] cantspeel: CmonRaz
[2:35:41] CasterFroskurinn: Awww look at Doinb
[2:35:46] papasullyc: @solairefastora fair enough
[2:35:49] Renegade_Angels: @CasterFroskurinn If LGD wins, JDG are in?
[2:35:50] CasterFroskurinn: Trying to pick up his team. What a fucking class act
[2:35:54] tomrRRR: result?
[2:35:58] AngieFoxtrot: Aww Doinb BibleThump
[2:36:01] mujarshad: doinb BibleThump
[2:36:02] CasterFroskurinn: His team feeds like crazy and he instead pats the on the back to pick them up
[2:36:05] OUTPLAYED_PogChamp: 2day has lck?
[2:36:08] FBHeron: Doinb is great, I swear
[2:36:13] papasullyc: @cantspeel HeyGuys
[2:36:22] inamatuslol: so this is where Liquid buys doinb right?
[2:36:26] 삼도천심해어: C9 LUL
[2:36:38] AIiceMargatroid: Hey, Doinb went out swinging, so that's at least admirable.
[2:36:40] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn An incredible comeback in the first place to come back from 0-6, can't wait to see what they can do next season
[2:36:44] AmazingSalvia: you cant report players on tournament client FeelsBadMan
[2:36:52] cantspeel: @Sullyc2323 KonCha
[2:37:03] FBHeron: @CasterFroskurinn Is there anywhere I can find a graph of gold difference mapped against times when teams get ardent?
[2:37:03] AIiceMargatroid: F, and please never put Xinyi on Gragas ever again.
[2:37:05] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora I like Lokken and I hope they stick with him and continue to develop their talent.
[2:37:06] arbieederz: liquid doinb PogChamp
[2:37:12] ZCanuck: was doinb really doing anything special that game? wasn't he suppose to smoke a kass in lane?
[2:37:17] WhoKnowsUA: Classic Riot, nerf Cait to see Tristana on top so in a few patches she will be nerfed too and completely forgotten for an about a year AGAIN
[2:37:20] CasterFroskurinn: @FireballEUW not that I would know. Sorry!
[2:37:35] FBHeron: Damn. I bet that'd be such an interesting stat
[2:37:35] NeptuneDweller: are players in this region forbidden from using spaces in their names?
[2:37:40] 南雨: doinb go TL??
[2:37:47] AIiceMargatroid: @ZCanuck He absolutely smashed Kass in lane. Xinyi just had one of the worst casks ever and knocked a tasty Lucian into SNG.
[2:37:51] esshun: @ZCanuck He was smocking that Kass and had the 2 mid turrets destroyed at 9min
[2:37:54] KonTaicho: how many games are gone?
[2:37:55] Hyrule13: @Regrup we saw your commentary on the first times. You can stop spamming it now bro
[2:37:56] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn would you rather them stick with this lineup or make a top/jungle change or grab a top carry sub in case of a meta shift?
[2:38:04] AIiceMargatroid: Lucian gets shutdown, Kass gets gold, difference gets mitigated. RIP
[2:38:08] mujarshad: @KonTaicho first set just ended
[2:38:14] ZCanuck: my claim is that wasn't that expected?
[2:38:14] esshun: But Xinyi keeps on making things worse for his team especially Doinb
[2:38:18] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora I would rather them develop this roster. It's def Atlus :3
[2:38:31] KonTaicho: @mujarshad thank you. any upsets?
[2:38:31] PapaSmithy: FeelsBadMan
[2:38:33] mattpotter: LGD predictions?
[2:38:38] esshun: Xinyi kept putting his own team down
[2:38:40] cantspeel: @PapaSmithy OWNED
[2:38:44] AIiceMargatroid: We still love you PapaSmithy!
[2:38:44] DanteMasamune: Papi Smithy PogChamp
[2:38:46] esshun: while their jungler did a lot
[2:38:58] esshun: So that was basically a 4 vs 6
[2:39:00] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn how do you think they could compensate if tank tops fall out of meta, Kabe hasn't been historically good on carry picks?
[2:39:01] FBHeron: @PapaSmithy is eternally #1 caster. Competitive league is love.
[2:39:03] Raphaelssk: LGD 2-0
[2:39:04] CasterFroskurinn: I love how not Fury Fury looks
[2:39:11] mattpotter: @Terrorsq you think?
[2:39:12] fanrlanz: QG Khan BibleThump LZ Khan PogChamp
[2:39:12] Hyrule13: lol
[2:39:26] Hyrule13: it's all about the inner fury
[2:39:26] mujarshad: @KonTaicho well sng was supposed to be better team, so, i guess not
[2:39:28] CasterFroskurinn: @Solairefastora Kabe needs to git gud on carries. But this is still just his first year of playing.
[2:39:33] AIiceMargatroid: @CasterFroskurinn Underneath that mask of stoic apathy lies the heart of a murderer. :^)
[2:39:36] Hyrule13: growing inside, crawling in his skin
[2:39:43] KonTaicho: @mujarshad mkay ty elaH
[2:39:50] Jiml0rd: Papasmithy is an og lpl caster I remember season 3 lpl
[2:40:00] PapaSmithy: SeemsGood
[2:40:00] mattpotter: how long till the next match?
[2:40:11] CasterFroskurinn: Papasmithy, Atlus, Spawn, PastryTime = all former LPL casters.
[2:40:34] mujarshad: @Steadyaimbro probably like 10 mins
[2:40:39] Jiml0rd: The yorick jungles
[2:40:42] fanrlanz: i miss spawn
[2:40:43] YoniMCI: wait...maybe it IS Atlus...dont they share a place to live?
[2:40:53] AIiceMargatroid: Hey, Frosk said LPL was developing talent. She never said it was just limited to players. :^)
[2:40:59] FBHeron: "Excellent Shoutcasting" seems like what PapaSmithy would name his mixtape honestly
[2:41:09] MikeFrozt: do you know if you're casking at worlds yet, @CasterFroskurinn
[2:41:15] KonTaicho: dingdong in playoffs monkaS
[2:41:21] mujarshad: watch some lms playoffs while you wait VoHiYo
[2:41:24] CasterFroskurinn: We have a big workload and a small team. So we're always getting better and grinding day in and out.
[2:41:33] CasterFroskurinn: Worlds casting list hasn't been released yet
[2:41:34] AIiceMargatroid: @MikeFrozt She said earlier that they hadn't released Worlds casting list yet.
[2:41:41] MikeFrozt: ah np
[2:41:59] paperboathat_: @casterfroskurinn You've mentioned the sheer amount of talent Chins grows, why don't teams consider importing from a China instead of Korea?
[2:42:03] AIiceMargatroid: Although honestly I hope the LPL and LCK can field most of their casters. You guys are great and it'd be nice if the daywalkers over at NA got to see your casting more.
[2:42:06] CasterFroskurinn: Raz is a great example. He's really matured over the course of the split and is much stronger than he was.
[2:42:11] Tsunnal: @casterfroskurinn wish u the best of luck. Keep up the great job
[2:42:12] CasterFroskurinn: ;)
[2:42:20] mujarshad: lol wtf, cho just solod jax in lms playoffs
[2:42:27] Moe11436: who won 1st game?
[2:42:30] Hyrule13: @CasterFroskurinn did you get to check brazilian casting while you were here? I'm really proud of our team
[2:42:33] KonTaicho: elaOh
[2:42:33] mujarshad: at level 11
[2:42:39] AIiceMargatroid: (Also tbh I'd love to hear PapaSmithy's voice live without having to sleep in the morning after.)
[2:42:51] CasterFroskurinn: @Hyrule13 The CBloL casters are so cool!
[2:43:02] mattpotter: Newbee vs RNG predictions?
[2:43:10] Tking94: rng
[2:43:14] mujarshad: @Moe11436 sng won first set
[2:43:16] AIiceMargatroid: Rooting for RNG.
[2:43:18] Moe11436: Steadyaimbro uzi is gonna carry with teemo adc SeemsGood
[2:43:20] fanrlanz: RNG ez
[2:43:26] Moe11436: mujarshad thanks
[2:43:29] Tking94: rng will 2-0
[2:43:31] Tsunnal: @casterfroskurinn your thoughts on LPL compared to other regions, mainly LCK in the current meta
[2:43:38] Jiml0rd: I feel like 1907 fenerbace could beat lpl 3rd seed in worlds playins
[2:43:38] paperboathat_: Swift needs to step up if they want to win
[2:43:44] CasterFroskurinn: @zoomenhanced So many noodles.
[2:44:01] Raphaelssk: imp 1x9
[2:44:11] Someone_on_my_bike: When Uzi stops thinking he is a god vayne then he will be better Keepo
[2:44:29] fanrlanz: ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:44:37] Tking94: Have they lost when he's played vayne though?
[2:44:40] CasterFroskurinn: I dont watch enough LCK to make a strong prediction or assessment. I watch their games but I don't study them.
[2:44:45] mattpotter: OMG win?
[2:44:49] Hyrule13: gosh what an terrible AD
[2:45:00] EmpressXenia: TriHard TriHard
[2:45:00] fanrlanz: he lost last time toward OMG

[2:45:36] Someone_on_my_bike: Those figures SeemsGood
[2:45:37] ZCanuck: wtf, where can i buy those?
[2:45:45] AIiceMargatroid: SG Amiibos. If you hear distant squeeing in the distance, that's me.

[2:45:55] Teemo_Main_Btw: LULU Kreygasm

[2:45:59] MikeFrozt: you can probably get them on amazon.
[2:46:03] Tsunnal: @casterfroskurinn I think IMP should just return to Korea, what about u?
[2:46:12] Teemo_Main_Btw: No lucean ? TriHard
[2:46:19] DanteMasamune: McDonalds quality LUL
[2:46:19] ZCanuck: if finals was on something like 7.10 I think LZ would be favs, I'm not sure how well the current patch suits lz's carries, especially khan
[2:46:22] Hyrule13: star guardians are fabulous
[2:46:25] Epicsmoky: maybe cheking the lol store?
[2:46:25] CasterFroskurinn: Imp doesn't watn to return to Korea - he said so in his AMA. He wants to travel more
[2:46:25] EmilyNami: TehePelo
[2:46:29] mattpotter: OMG and RNG 2-0s would be nice
[2:46:41] ZCanuck: TL Imp confirmed

Imo Longzhu will win unless SKT goes hardcore on cocaine or something and does ham
