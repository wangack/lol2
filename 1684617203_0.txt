[1:11:31] CastIronJake: Hows the games been tonight chat?
[1:11:39] DobbsjustDobbs: It's gonna be -3 F and snowing in Kentucky
[1:11:58] AnorienNightwish: I haven't had a christmas tree in forever
[1:11:58] Llyin_: Southwest ohio here, supposed to be -1 with wind chills around -40 to - 50
[1:12:11] SlipCrit: fuuuuuuuuuuuuuk that
[1:12:20] Kyanilis: hard pass
[1:12:34] Kymix: @Llyin_ it is about the same here. except constant -20
[1:12:36] BarryCarlyon: We gonna need a bigger gun
[1:12:50] MrJaycawbz: It turns into a Mei icicle
[1:12:54] Llyin_: yup and our power substations around here suck bad, a squirrel knocked power out for 5 days a couple years ago
[1:13:02] zSKIz1: Will you play SF6 a lot?
[1:13:08] BarryCarlyon: The air is more dense due to it being cold. Which will reduce range and power. But marginally.
[1:13:09] ghostsofcarcosa: It can cause the bullets trajectory to getm essed up
[1:13:12] Dredstryde: It shouldn't affect the bullet combustion at all
[1:13:13] CastIronJake: Wouldn't change anything, unless it was cold enough to jam/freeze the oil of the gun
[1:13:19] TDotTerror: Californians in this chat are probably horrified.
[1:13:27] ThatWazGuy: there would be more air resistance in cold weather
[1:13:36] ChiefGreen1eaf: I agree with you JP, i even have my tree up. Northern Iowa is looking at 9-12 inches of snow and around -45 windchill. Lived here all my life so used to it
[1:13:44] NoorElBahrain: did the squirrel have a knife? Find out more about those squirrels on Last Call for Adventure
[1:13:47] NoorElBahrain: !dnd
[1:13:47] Dredstryde: Oh - the travel wouldn't be affected either

[1:13:52] CastIronJake: I don't think thats cold enough to alter ballistics
[1:14:07] ghostsofcarcosa: Very marginal affects from a cursory look
[1:14:09] BarryCarlyon: It would need to get way more cold for anything to really be noticable
[1:14:10] ThatWazGuy: bullet would slow down like 1% faster
[1:14:12] Dredstryde: I've hunted in -33 degree weather and it didn't bother my rifle at all
[1:14:14] Goose15xd: lillia
[1:14:19] Blue33orange: Lillia probably
[1:14:20] closeshot: i would say as long as the rifling on the barrel is in good condition no it wouldnt matter on how cold it is
[1:14:22] Goose15xd: GHOST
[1:14:31] Snowman_Sir: sounds like a dodge to me LUL

[1:16:29] EightBitDelight: I calm down during landing and it's the riskiest part. my brain is dumb
[1:16:42] Dredstryde: Xanax deals with that xD
[1:16:50] KiDisaster: people drinking before flights has always been kinda wild to me i can't imagine anywhere i'd rather be drunk less than on a plane
[1:16:54] KiDisaster: sounds awful
[1:16:59] closeshot: xanax changes ur personality dont it?
[1:17:03] nikodemuscrowley: just get depressio nthen you dont care either way, thats how i handle it xD
[1:17:20] MrJaycawbz: I get something similar when I'm travelling with people and don't have access to my own car. Idon't like feeling like I can't leave a situation if I wanted to.
[1:17:24] EightBitDelight: makes me hungry
[1:17:45] Rowz: Sounds somewhat similar to stuff Dan Ryckert talked about in his anxiety book
[1:18:14] CastIronJake: Oh no....
