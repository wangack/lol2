[0:10:38] KonikMiejski: if there is one thing that i understood during my years with league, is that lack of true adc in my team is a dodge for me

[0:14:19] NoorElBahrain: oh no
[0:14:32] Price_FTW: we hate to see it PepeHands
[0:14:39] Giant0ctopus: 7k pc btw KEKW
[0:14:45] LagoutLoud: That's probably more LoL than your
[0:14:46] BakinPacman: yeah league is spaghetti tbh
[0:15:05] Nickonil: ijpSIP just like my pc cant turn off proberly then i flip my breaker..
[0:15:08] Price_FTW: i actually get a slightly longer than normal alt tab black screen from League as well.. no freezes recently, but still
[0:15:36] NoorElBahrain: ijpPRAY
[0:15:46] Sonatta: ijpPRAY
[0:15:50] BakinPacman: league is why i tend to leave a second desktop existence running
[0:15:51] AinzN: ijpPRAY
[0:15:59] RlDennis: Huh, the only issue I have with alt tabbing in league is that it sometimes messes with the vsync (or that it doesn't lock the cursor to the screen anymore)
[0:16:07] BakinPacman: it can save the full restart
[0:16:11] z_z_z_: !PJs
[0:16:26] Price_FTW: at least the music isnt being toxic
[0:16:38] NoorElBahrain: !PJ
[0:16:38] itmeBOT: PJ is JP's monochrome menace alter ego. He loves competitive games, salt mines and long walks on the beach.
[0:17:03] Nickonil: LUL long walks on the beach hahahha i got that refrence
[0:17:10] larkhill: first blood really was bot lane
[0:17:28] BakinPacman: just gonna have to wait fora  gank
[0:17:47] Gorn_Vernaleer: in this context the music is very dramatic, love it
[0:19:12] zestyzanzil: loses ability
[0:19:18] Giant0ctopus: im confursed, is he a frog or a catfish?
[0:19:25] larkhill: @Giant0ctopus yes
[0:19:29] FiraVII: hes the river king
[0:19:33] BakinPacman: prolly good time to go b while wave is pushed
[0:19:34] FiraVII: thats all you need to know
[0:19:41] AinzN: @Giant0ctopus Kench is ijpF1 ijpF3
[0:19:44] RlDennis: Even if it went off it wouldn't be that bad for you
[0:19:48] KiDisaster: sometimes teammate rng blesses you
[0:20:00] BakinPacman: cause he will freeze it being a jerk LUL
[0:20:04] RlDennis: His Q is only really effective on the outer ring. The inside doesn't apply a passive stack or heal him
[0:20:22] BakinPacman: cant really fight him unless your 6
[0:20:45] Nickonil: ijpKEK this might be a win yet
[0:20:47] OmegaCrits: Just got to watch/listen to the latest episode of Last Call for Adventure and I can't remember the last time I laughed that much to a D&D session. You and the rest of the cast are killing it.
[0:20:51] FiraVII: Irelia really going for trades under tower oof
[0:21:13] RlDennis: Looks fine though, Irelia losing a ton of farm to the tower
[0:21:20] Gorn_Vernaleer: is Kassadin viable again? He was my main back in the day, but i stopped playing after he got nerfed into the ground..
[0:21:39] RlDennis: Kassadin vs Irelia is gonna be rough for a while anyway. so that trade was decent
[0:22:05] RlDennis: @Gorn_Vernaleer he's still the 'get to level 16 and kill everything on the map' kind of character
[0:22:06] BakinPacman: this is good for you tbh
[0:22:42] FiraVII: i miss being able to nom the cannon minion with Kench
[0:22:52] RlDennis: LUL I forgot about that
[0:23:01] Joebeezer: Joebeezer subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! pj is pretty
[0:23:01] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Joebeezer! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:23:03] RlDennis: Eating minions and spitting them at enemies
[0:23:39] RlDennis: Annoying thing for darius is, if he applies his passive to you. He can't step into turret range without getting aggro LUL
[0:23:57] yellgler: pj - pyjamas?
[0:24:05] AinzN: !PJ
[0:24:05] itmeBOT: PJ is JP's monochrome menace alter ego. He loves competitive games, salt mines and long walks on the beach.
[0:24:28] Ebra: why did she go back
[0:24:30] yellgler: ah, not pyjamas:(

[0:24:36] Brandon_Scales: greed
[0:24:48] FiraVII: like your ult couldve done anything jenntaDerp
[0:24:57] RlDennis: you weren't in range for ult. that wouldn't have changed anything LUL
[0:25:00] AinzN: @FiraVII that's what I was thinking
[0:25:09] Gorn_Vernaleer: teammates turning around with 1HP... so annoying
[0:25:17] Price_FTW: NICE lets go
[0:25:20] Nickonil: fuck yeah! boom
[0:25:27] Nickonil: LETS GO! nofCozy
[0:25:48] FiraVII: hopefully the Irelia doing poorly tilts the enemy team jenntaEvil
[0:25:56] BakinPacman: they scale better later
[0:25:59] Price_FTW: from zero to hero. from afk to saves the day. its PJ here to get us clear and earn this dub and get some subs
[0:26:00] RlDennis: I think Thresh is playing well
[0:26:01] BakinPacman: prolyl wanna finish early
[0:26:13] dasmex: Just because they have good picks doesn't mean they can use them.
[0:26:15] STNbond: against 5th generation fighters? no way
[0:26:23] Giant0ctopus: is that the same tom cruise who suffocated hiis copilot?
[0:26:27] Nickonil: doesnt matter if the team comp is good if they dont know how to play them
[0:26:28] RlDennis: And kassadin isn't feeding mid. Which is pretty hard to do in that matchup LUL
[0:26:56] FiraVII: peepoRun

[0:28:45] RlDennis: Irelia is gonna be scary yeah.
[0:28:58] FiraVII: @BakinPacman i think Irelia is handling that on their own lmao
[0:29:23] BakinPacman: ehhh just having items makes ehr broken so if she trades its even still
[0:29:35] RlDennis: She's overextending a lot, but that's because she's in a winning position mid. LUL if she actually roamed bot it'll get bad pretty quickly
[0:29:55] Price_FTW: this Darius making Darius look balanced
[0:30:02] RlDennis: Right? LUL
[0:30:22] FiraVII: daaang

[0:32:59] Price_FTW: dang he was even apologizing lmao
[0:33:10] dasmex: Minimap awareness? In Silver?

[0:34:39] Jay_rb: !pj
[0:34:40] itmeBOT: PJ is JP's monochrome menace alter ego. He loves competitive games, salt mines and long walks on the beach.
[0:34:41] Gorn_Vernaleer: ButtBreacher has real Milfhunter energy
[0:34:58] Jay_rb: ah PJ is just gamer JP got it KEKW

[0:35:25] Gorn_Vernaleer: LUL
[0:35:38] jietoh007: is it worth to start playing this game when you are new. played the first months never touched it  again.  Is it still so toxic?
[0:35:45] Jay_rb: No shot
[0:36:01] Price_FTW: the answer is dont let yourself down, bud.
[0:36:03] STNbond: always has been
[0:36:17] GreenShaDow42: I actually love league, but i haven't played it in years because it's so toxic
[0:36:20] beararsed: @jietoh007 if you thought it was toxic then then i dont think its for you
[0:36:21] Zyntho: @jietoh007 pretty toxic, I'd say not worth it unless playing with friends
[0:36:27] RlDennis: I don't think it's that bad, when you compare it to other established competitive games
[0:36:33] FiraVII: @jietoh007 ARAM mode is generally less toxic but you can always turn off chat entirely
[0:36:36] Achubra: have you mentioned if you are going to try for gold in the new season
[0:36:42] Jay_rb: It would be the most toxic if it had voice chat
[0:36:48] Price_FTW: i mean its not Overwatch toxic, but its still pretty toxic
[0:36:53] Egomaniacalhero: agreed, league isn't anything compared to like overwatch toxicity in my opinion
[0:36:55] Nickonil: league has voice chat LUL
[0:37:12] GreenShaDow42: high plat/low diamond was crazy toxic
[0:37:12] FiraVII: LoL voice chat is only for parties
[0:37:13] RlDennis: I think Overwatch, Dota are definitely up there
[0:37:17] BakinPacman: voice chat just is more efficient in reaction
[0:37:21] BakinPacman: LUL
[0:37:26] beararsed: they did add that fish hook ping and say to get a rope, its pretty toxic
[0:37:35] Jay_rb: Sounds about right

[0:40:41] FiraVII: oh no laynaOhNo
[0:40:44] BakinPacman: i actually cant wait for the hades 2 soundtrack
[0:40:44] Price_FTW: i hate when you play really well and still cant carry the team then the 0/15 top laner blames you, the junbler
[0:41:04] AltraWolf: Hecarim is just as bad if not worse from the games ive been having
[0:41:12] BakinPacman: gotta farm that free gold
[0:41:14] RlDennis: Boots are a good buy vs her right?
[0:41:14] SynGG: her soul grab thing is so frustrating
[0:41:14] Giant0ctopus: thats absolutely not true, but also the truest thing ive heard in my life
[0:41:14] Price_FTW: Hades 2 being a thing is so hype. incredibly excited. Gonna do my best to avoid any early access or spoilerage
[0:41:17] BakinPacman: and not even fight her
[0:41:24] Gorn_Vernaleer: some songs play during events like fire/plague/war, so it gets dark at times, if that is still the Anno OST
[0:41:46] BakinPacman: i feel you just poke her in between her cooldowns
[0:41:48] Achubra: thornmail so she gets the debuff from your soul
[0:41:49] SynGG: The ult easy to just not fight in but the soul grab thing you just gotta dodge
[0:42:04] BakinPacman: its not a bad idea
[0:42:14] Price_FTW: this tune has Flute Player from the Game Awards energy. Im here for it
[0:42:19] BakinPacman: try freeze the lane as much as possible too
[0:42:23] Giant0ctopus: this lane = moon2HUH coxWiggle moon2A
[0:42:25] RlDennis: It used to be buy boots and dodge tentacle slams. Not too much you can do about getting hit by a soul grab
[0:42:26] Achubra: shes pushing like a goof
[0:42:35] teutomi: If she misses the grab she's pretty useless
[0:42:41] FiraVII: might as well fight her off the soul tho
[0:42:54] RlDennis: But her missing a soul grab used to be pretty bad because of the cooldown
[0:42:57] BakinPacman: yeah just tag her like that and back off
[0:43:04] BakinPacman: dont let her abuse the tentancles
[0:43:11] Gorn_Vernaleer: a song like that makes the laning phase a lot more dramatic :D
[0:43:15] Achubra: if she misses her E, it's like an 7 second cd early
[0:43:23] Ahvee: ijpFLURK
[0:43:27] Sonatta: a character with it's own towers? surely that's broken
[0:43:34] BakinPacman: she will be primed for a gank naturally
[0:43:35] FiraVII: @Ahvee ahveeHeart
[0:43:56] SynGG: To play devil advocate I think the same about kench late game
[0:44:14] RlDennis: I wonder if Sett would be a good pick into her
[0:44:15] Ahvee: FiraVII ahveeHeart
[0:44:15] BakinPacman: jungle shoulda been here ganking already to be fair
[0:44:25] GreenShaDow42: most illoais will focus the spirit she pulls and you can usually grab a bunch of free dmg on them
[0:44:30] Price_FTW: this tune is giving me Gladiator "now we are free" vibes
[0:44:35] Giant0ctopus: @itmeJP you mean hentai?
[0:44:41] SynGG: I think well all do for whate ver lane you plane, yone mids like a trigger for me
[0:44:43] Fenwig: !pj
[0:44:43] itmeBOT: PJ is JP's monochrome menace alter ego. He loves competitive games, salt mines and long walks on the beach.
[0:44:46] AinzN: I can't wait to main Illoai in Project L
[0:44:54] SynGG: play* I cant english
[0:45:15] FiraVII: at least Kench will heal a lot of it back
[0:45:32] Sonatta: jungle should have been there
[0:45:35] RlDennis: he's resetting I think?
[0:45:41] RlDennis: Oh wait no, It's diana
[0:45:45] Price_FTW: started bandage toss been slow clearing all game so far.
[0:45:49] itmeBOT:  If you are enjoying the stream, click the follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[0:46:06] galdamesh: @Price_FTW amumu is support isn't he?
[0:46:09] Price_FTW: oh... tf its mumu support. idk wtf diana be doing
[0:46:13] RlDennis: Warwick was top side
[0:46:20] Price_FTW: yeh sorry just saw
[0:46:28] RlDennis: Diana was moving for a gank on mid. Think katarina is having a rough time too
[0:46:30] BakinPacman: that first item should help alot
[0:46:38] BakinPacman: just gotta time your absorb shield too
[0:46:47] ReginaldXIV: It's -33F (-36C) with wind chill here monkaEyes
[0:47:25] FiraVII: jenntaEw
[0:47:25] Gorn_Vernaleer: -36? that is crazy cold
[0:47:25] BakinPacman: diana screwed you there
[0:47:28] BakinPacman: LUL
[0:47:41] BakinPacman: she shoulda backed off
[0:47:44] BakinPacman: till her q landed
[0:47:56] Giant0ctopus: did you see how diana thought illaoi wentt into the bush when you ulted so she wasnt in position?
[0:48:07] legofreak59: !dfgoty
[0:48:08] itmeBOT: Vote for the Dropped Frames' community Game of the Year (and other categories)! https://dfgoty.com
[0:48:16] BakinPacman: yeah hug tower now basically
[0:48:25] RlDennis: You problaby had a good chance solo yeah
[0:48:43] SynGG: @ReginaldXIV 25C in Aus :D
[0:49:21] ReginaldXIV: It's Summer there though
[0:49:25] Giant0ctopus: ww jungle with flash!? DansGame
[0:49:33] BakinPacman: ehhh\
[0:49:49] Price_FTW: is it worth to spend the time to clear the Hentacles?
[0:50:06] SynGG: True looking like 30C for xmas
[0:50:17] Achubra: in a solo lane yea, in a team fight you run away from the ult
[0:50:23] BakinPacman: diana looks like a bot
[0:50:25] BakinPacman: KEKW
[0:50:28] Sonatta: mumu is the problem NODDERS
[0:50:34] quaxim: I hope to not see pj in Christmas pjs someday
[0:50:35] RlDennis: Wtf is Zeri doing LUL
[0:50:50] synthetik666: russet potato jp? or yukon gold? or......?
[0:51:03] BakinPacman: the pirate music from anno
[0:51:06] quaxim: Potatoes are all tasty
[0:51:28] Sonatta: it's the kind of potatoes mcdonalds grows for their french fries KEKW
[0:51:42] BakinPacman: yeah thats how you bet her
[0:51:45] BakinPacman: spam q lol
[0:51:59] Gorn_Vernaleer: russet is gold IV
[0:53:12] RlDennis: You're getting better at reading her now. But it's gonna be hard to win. Too much of a stat check
[0:53:15] Darkaros: peepoArrive ðŸš¿
[0:53:45] NoorElBahrain: @Darkaros ijpHI
[0:53:57] Nickonil: @Darkaros LUL do you shower like 5 times a day, i feel you always get back from a showever when i see you
[0:54:37] Zyntho: Press R to win
[0:54:41] BakinPacman: gotta flash outta the ulti tbh its busted
[0:54:53] joogos: DansGame
[0:55:43] Giant0ctopus: any truers?
[0:55:45] P0rtilo: She dares talk shit, i hate that :D
[0:57:08] galdamesh: you can't r first
[0:57:26] RlDennis: LUL Kat
[0:57:30] Gorn_Vernaleer: bot won one fight, they will never ff
[0:58:07] Achubra: i think if you drag it out to 55mins it should be good
[0:58:12] TheRealScrump: JP cares as much about this game as i care about my life!!
[0:58:26] RlDennis: How is their ashe doing? I feel like that guy's just feeding too
[0:58:28] arrowdeath4: is this the anno 1800 soundtrack?
[0:58:29] NoorElBahrain: ijpSAD
[0:58:35] NoorElBahrain: arrowdeath4 yes
[0:58:36] Gorn_Vernaleer: @arrowdeath4 yes
[0:59:06] arrowdeath4: ...clearly i've played entirely too much of that game
[0:59:07] RlDennis: Wait
[0:59:12] RlDennis: What happened to your ult?
[0:59:17] galdamesh: have you tried AP tham?
[0:59:21] TheRealScrump: just outta curiosity, does that shadow form you create of yourself cause you damage? im sorry im not familure with this hero
[0:59:31] LissXIV: LissXIV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! Happy Holidays everybody
[0:59:31] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing LissXIV! ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE ijpLOVE
[0:59:32] Brandon_Scales: @therealscrump you cool bro, your never alone in your feelings bro, whisper me if you need to just unload some shit
[0:59:34] Giant0ctopus: 4 lvls down
[0:59:43] RlDennis: Was your ult used on the soul that was dragged out?
[0:59:44] Achubra: @TheRealScrump illaoi pulls your sould and does damage to it
[0:59:46] RlDennis: Is that possible?
[0:59:50] FiraVII: @TheRealScrump he pulls your soul out and hits it which damages you
[0:59:50] Achubra: soul*
[1:00:02] TheRealScrump: ahh cool thanks guys
[1:00:07] BakinPacman: the only thing that will help tbh is a hourglass KEKW
[1:00:15] BakinPacman: gotta avoid the burst damage
[1:00:34] RlDennis: LUL the stuck minion
[1:00:39] ObeyTheEgg: same
[1:00:40] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play! JP's Twitch contract has ended, and as a member of the ads incentive program he no longer has precise control over when ads run. Ads will run 6 minutes automatically every hour. As always, subscribing to the channel prevents ads. Thanks! ijpLOVE
[1:00:43] TheRealScrump: @Brandon_Scales thank you brother i appreciate it.
[1:00:46] FiraVII: if you run away far enough from the soul it snaps back to you but you get slowed and it spawns more tentacles
[1:00:48] arrowdeath4: yup laneing against illoi is awful
[1:00:48] Achubra: @TheRealScrump you can run out of the range of it and it will snap back to you
[1:00:50] BakinPacman: the trick is to bait the ulti and then reengage
[1:00:51] RlDennis: Yeah. Illaoi is hard to play against until you basically know exactly what she does
[1:00:53] BakinPacman: its sad
[1:00:58] aLeafGuy: if you leave range of the soul it disappears but the damage still converts
[1:01:17] TempestPhoenix: its really depending on dodging her skill shots
[1:01:28] arrowdeath4: raid boss down!
[1:01:32] Ay_Oh: 4 people sit top and almost let her just walk away
[1:01:32] Price_FTW: RAID BOSS DOWN
[1:01:33] NoorElBahrain: raiding in League
[1:01:34] FiraVII: theres an entire meta game of just dealing with the tentacles
[1:01:37] arrowdeath4: you're all clear, kid, now let's blow this thing and go home
[1:01:50] RlDennis: Yeah. dodging her skills, not fighting next to the soul, baiting ult out. Are basically all things you have to do
[1:02:31] FiraVII: NODDERS
[1:02:41] TempestPhoenix: also having a reliable disengage for teamfights really help + avoid tight areas
[1:02:42] RlDennis: ijpNODDERS It is
[1:03:05] galdamesh: pick morde against her it's basically unwinnable for illoai
[1:03:14] RlDennis: But at this point of the game, just walk outside of the soul range to end it early. taking 2k damage from transferred damage is gonna hurt you more at this point of the game
[1:03:35] RlDennis: Does Kat have ignite?
[1:03:47] Brandon_Scales: can I rid myself of this dammed pin message
[1:03:49] RlDennis: How did Kat get that kill LUL
[1:03:50] galdamesh: @RlDennis kat ult gives anti heal
[1:04:06] TempestPhoenix: but its all poke, she has no real way of finishing you off. No mobility so you can walk away. Just stay under turret focus on csing, she cant dive
[1:04:09] teffy42: illaoi is a lane bully but becomes completely useless if she doesn't get ahead
[1:04:09] RlDennis: I know, I'm just saying because she got the kill when she had died already
[1:04:23] Darkaros: @Brandon_Scales you can hide it ya, click the dropdown
[1:04:27] galdamesh: scorch maybe
[1:04:35] RlDennis: Yeah, her real weakness early on is that she does not do well at chasing enemies until iceborn gauntlet
[1:04:36] dasmex: The button that looks like an eye
[1:04:38] BakinPacman: gotta push 5 man mid prolly
[1:04:43] BakinPacman: split push you will lose LUL
[1:04:52] RlDennis: Because if she chases, she doesn't have the tentacles to back her up
[1:05:13] RlDennis: OH
[1:05:16] RlDennis: You can
[1:05:16] Gorn_Vernaleer: as you do
[1:05:19] rHakkar: Dude the most tilting type of harass is the one you never expect. "Diana licks glue" . Dude Clap
[1:05:21] RlDennis: I know what happens
[1:05:34] Achubra: i think she has a .5s of invul in the air
[1:05:36] arrowdeath4: i'm pretty sure she's untargetable when she ults. why? just cause
[1:05:38] RlDennis: You're ulting her during her ult animation (the little jump) she has unstoppable in that.. .5 seconds
[1:05:40] tore522: she is immune during her ult jump
[1:05:53] RlDennis: Basically
[1:06:02] Achubra: most likely, you are the largest target to E
[1:06:04] RlDennis: If you wait that out and ult afterward it'd work
[1:06:41] galdamesh: well it feel real bad for her entire ult to get cancelled by a random knock up
[1:07:03] Gorn_Vernaleer: but that happens to a lot of champs
[1:07:03] Brandon_Scales: my pin message doesn't have a eye or something that says hide just that the bot sent it at 505
[1:07:19] TempestPhoenix: its just a noob stomper champ
[1:07:21] Brandon_Scales: on moble
[1:07:22] BakinPacman: your bot lane has been mia for most of the game
[1:07:26] Nickonil: @NoorElBahrain "best multiplayer" dosent have "dark and darker"
[1:07:36] RlDennis: @TempestPhoenix It really is.
[1:07:53] Nickonil: also for characters are we supposed to just choose game? LUL
[1:07:58] BakinPacman: baron would be smart right now
[1:08:01] Darkaros: yes re: characters
[1:08:02] RlDennis: Amumu should be running interference tbh. Try to keep her away from the rest of the team.
[1:08:02] BakinPacman: or you lose LUl
[1:08:09] BakinPacman: its alll in baron or lose LUL
[1:08:26] TempestPhoenix: @TempestPhoenix you need proper spacing for her and thats pretty hard for lower divisions
[1:08:27] NoorElBahrain: Nickonil there should a missing game button and you can submit missing games to in a form
[1:08:39] RlDennis: I think it's easier to deal with urgot right?
[1:08:46] Nickonil: @NoorElBahrain danDerp sorry i am blind
[1:08:50] NoorElBahrain: @Brandon_Scales You don't see the pinned message?
[1:08:51] Ay_Oh: i mean if mumu could just lock down illaoi
[1:08:52] AltraWolf: theres a bunch of broen champs right now and its so gross/annoying
[1:08:59] AltraWolf: broken*
[1:09:00] NoorElBahrain: Nickonil np
[1:09:09] Reptilis2: doesnt illaoi have some hardcounters?
[1:09:19] galdamesh: alot less people play illoai them urgot though... since you can't really blind pick illaoi
[1:09:25] RlDennis: @Reptilis2 Champs with dashes, I'd say
[1:09:34] galdamesh: @Reptilis2 morde is unwinnable for her
[1:09:39] galdamesh: anyone with range is hard
[1:09:41] FiraVII: WAIT you have a Zeri??
[1:09:56] RlDennis: Oooh. Morde can ult her in her ult and she wouldn't have tentacles anymore right? LUL
[1:10:08] BakinPacman: mumu KEKW
[1:10:11] arrowdeath4: someone besides you needs healing reduc
[1:10:11] galdamesh: yeah she ults then you ult and she gets 0 tentacles
[1:10:12] Ay_Oh: amumu solo ults the warwick
[1:10:17] Sonatta: ddHuh
[1:10:27] Gorn_Vernaleer: that champ seems to be good at everything, crazy
[1:11:03] TempestPhoenix: @Gorn_Vernaleer not really, you can just run away and let her ult time out, then she is useless
[1:11:30] galdamesh: @Gorn_Vernaleer she's pretty much just a split pusher unless she gets fed then she can do whatever the hell she wants
[1:11:44] Brandon_Scales: @NoorElBahrain your pin message has no dismiss function for me.
[1:11:46] FiraVII: oh shit i never knew you could move the surrender box jenntaNotes thx JP
[1:11:47] teffy42: this team has 4 melee that all wanna jump in so it's rough against illaoi
[1:11:53] RlDennis: I think her biggest problem as a character is that no matter how well you play yourself, your team needs to play well vs her aswell
[1:11:59] Gorn_Vernaleer: @Gorn_Vernaleer so the damage and the survivability are just during the ult that high?
[1:12:04] TempestPhoenix: the easiest way to find the weaknesses of an 'OP' champ is playing it yourself
[1:12:14] RlDennis: It is. yeah
[1:12:21] thatguyuknow985: Too scared
[1:12:22] TheRealScrump: do those tentecals of hers grant sight too?
[1:12:27] Darkaros: @Brandon_Scales you can't click the dropdown -> click the 3 dots -> hide for yourself?
[1:12:41] NoorElBahrain: ^
[1:12:46] RlDennis: @TheRealScrump I don't think so, unless they're slamming the ground.
[1:12:49] Brandon_Scales: @darkaros crazy thing is it doesn't have the 3 dots
[1:12:54] TempestPhoenix: @Gorn_Vernaleer yea gets spawned tentcals based on how many people surround her. They are the main source of her dmg and healing
[1:13:06] RlDennis: Nice save
[1:13:12] BakinPacman: 1k gold
[1:13:15] Brandon_Scales: @darkaros when I lower the message its just says the bottom sent it at 505pm
[1:13:15] BakinPacman: LMFAO
[1:13:18] FiraVII: 1000 GOLD hypeE
[1:13:18] Zyntho: woooo
[1:13:18] Ay_Oh: omg amumu actually ulted multiple ppl
[1:13:19] Ebra: winnable?
[1:13:22] TheRealScrump: Baren!!
[1:13:24] DrYaguar: Pog
[1:13:24] RlDennis: That was such a good teamfight from you. PogBones
[1:13:34] FiraVII: anneLoot
[1:13:36] NoorElBahrain: Brandon_Scales maybe the UI is messed up. Have you tried refreshing?
[1:13:44] Darkaros: @Brandon_Scales Hmm should be 3 vertical dots next to the dropdown button
[1:13:54] Darkaros: but might be a half-baked Twitch feature LUL for non-browser
[1:13:56] Pickedaname_: There's nothing on refresh
[1:14:15] Brandon_Scales: @noorelbahrain I exit out of the app and opened and after 2 ads Still, I'll look of I need an update
[1:14:25] BakinPacman: top really needs to be pushed
[1:14:30] TempestPhoenix: kinda need soul
[1:14:33] Brandon_Scales: @darkaros ya might be right
[1:14:39] FiraVII: i keep forgetting we have a Zeri since theyre never actually with the team
[1:14:42] RlDennis: It is, just gotta kite the Illaoi. Rest of their team seems pretty bad
[1:14:44] TheRealScrump: JP has the HP of a Raid Boss lol
[1:14:47] BakinPacman: it will keep forcing you back otherwise
[1:15:03] NoorElBahrain: @Brandon_Scales oh twitch mobile? I'm sorry. Twitch is being twitch I guess
[1:15:09] BakinPacman: cant let them tp in to the base basically
[1:15:36] RlDennis: Nice
[1:15:38] Price_FTW: went to poo and came back and this one is still going?
[1:15:39] FiraVII: ijpEZ Clap
[1:15:46] AdamBadr1: hey JP/chat have you noticed more random champs being used in league/valo since the gamepass thing or is it just the usuak?
[1:15:51] FiraVII: a solid teleport play
[1:15:52] BakinPacman: that was perfect
[1:15:56] Reptilis2: did diana flash?
[1:15:57] RlDennis: She's starting to fall off now that your team isn't just throwing themselves into her ult LUL
[1:16:03] teffy42: illaoi can't explode people anymore, it's over
[1:16:05] BakinPacman: this is gonna be a struggle though LUL
[1:16:15] BakinPacman: top looking not great again LUL
[1:16:24] FiraVII: 1 bad teamfight and its a loss but this is recovering nicely
[1:16:30] galdamesh: @teffy42 she still wins easily if she just goes to a different lane then her team
[1:16:31] RlDennis: Just zone them away from dragon
[1:16:34] RlDennis: Should be good
[1:16:35] TempestPhoenix: @RlDennis there is still the elder flip LUL
[1:16:36] GreenShaDow42: illaoi is nearing her useless point, if she doesn't win early she only brings dmg which is easily kited. Kench brings a lot more to the team
[1:16:48] RlDennis: There is, but that can work in JP's favor LUL
[1:16:53] BakinPacman: that tower dif makes top push hard
[1:16:57] Brandon_Scales: nope no update, fuk u twitch always have to have some feature that kills the fun!
[1:17:08] TempestPhoenix: yea they kinda outscaled
[1:17:13] galdamesh: zeri WAY oop
[1:17:15] Ay_Oh: probably zeri bottom
[1:17:19] RlDennis: Ashe is pretty good for picking someone off, but pretty sure their ashe is terrible
[1:17:24] TempestPhoenix: illaoi, ww, ashe dont to anything late
[1:17:55] BakinPacman: iut should be fairer now
[1:17:59] RlDennis: Problaby titanic hydra last item right? just to add damage pressure to the illaoi?
[1:18:01] BakinPacman: supers are relaxed
[1:18:18] RlDennis: PogBones
[1:18:23] BakinPacman: yeah push mid hard
[1:18:26] Ahvee: ijpPOG
[1:18:29] teffy42: yeah illaoi can't do much anymore
[1:18:49] ReDliner8k: lol
[1:18:52] BakinPacman: prolly tower only though
[1:18:53] RlDennis: Juggernaut life right there.
[1:19:13] ReDliner8k: sadge
[1:19:19] RlDennis: lmao
[1:19:24] TempestPhoenix: ww LUL
[1:19:34] RlDennis: Just keep walking

[1:19:51] titanodin: gg
[1:19:52] LissXIV: Sick save JP
[1:19:55] RlDennis: Nice
[1:20:04] RlDennis: pinning the baron LUL Zeri
[1:20:06] captmoroni25: Just Voted, Thanks for all you do JP. Listen to DF constantly while I deliver in my FedEx truck haha
[1:20:10] RlDennis: Pinging*
[1:20:32] TempestPhoenix: no minions :/
[1:20:36] arrowdeath4: can't end == don't want to end
[1:20:44] RlDennis: gg
