[1:24:43] scribbin_: @papasmithy will we see ad casters comeback into midlane meta
[1:24:43] Machrus: @PapaSmithy i think taking 2s cd off of a lot of champions skills would push them into the meta
[1:24:46] Valodercy: old WutFace
[1:24:51] pandamarkii: man seeing lux back in the game...... dont remember that since like... froggen? lol

[1:55:33] jarvitz: the only person rusty hates is yamato and his Caitlyn
[1:55:34] RustyTheCaster: for what specifically friend @le_jocus
[1:55:36] 삼도천심해어: syndra corki ResidentSleeper
[1:55:39] mujarshad: monkzS syndra
[1:55:40] Le_JoCus: @RUSTYTheCASTER thanks for answering btw
[1:55:42] RustyTheCaster: I dont hate yamato!
[1:55:48] antster32: these picks ResidentSleeper
[1:55:48] AngieFoxtrot: SKT lose to LZ just to deny KT the 'easy' worlds spot. SKT going for the long con
[1:55:53] kalona45: Is syndra still good after the nerfs?
[1:56:01] jarvitz: Kappa
[1:56:01] calcil: fury BlessRNG
[1:56:09] yamamotothegreat: @AngieFoxtrot what do you mean
[1:56:11] TheFurioso: syndra has been broken since last worlds
[1:56:14] RustyTheCaster: all of the nerfs were minor
[1:56:16] CidIXlol: @kalona45 still good
[1:56:26] 삼도천심해어: syndra press R ResidentSleeper
[1:56:31] Le_JoCus: @RUSTYTheCASTER talkin about LZ vs SKT if there's any special pick you think we should keep eye on
[1:56:31] ryguy1212: trist>kalista
[1:56:43] TheFurioso: riot stiil doesn't give a real nerf to syndra
[1:56:45] jarvitz: why did the nerf syndra right before they are buffing her for star guardian sales?
[1:56:47] RustyTheCaster: perhaps Azir or Zed would be exciting
[1:56:59] TheFurioso: you can say riot favouritism

[1:57:48] jarvitz: will we see sona...
[1:57:50] RustyTheCaster: nami is worst ardent user so not atm but she could come back if meta shifts just slightly
[1:58:04] TheFurioso: I hope we will see some nerfs to mid lane champions for worlds
[1:58:07] 420juicelord69: Suning drafted so much better
[1:58:13] RustyTheCaster: even Taric exists now and he builds ardent
[1:58:26] RustyTheCaster: you dont pick Bard for the censer :p
[1:58:26] Kayrotyy: game 2 when there is already 2-0 ?
[1:58:34] AngieFoxtrot: @yamamotothegreat If SKT beat LZ then KT gets the 2nd worlds seed, but if SKT lose KT have to go through the gauntlet to get to worlds. I was joking that SKT would throw just to mess with KT
[1:58:35] MrBaneBlade: hi @RUSTYTheCASTER <3
[1:58:41] jarvitz: will the ardent nerfs on pbe do anything rusty?
[1:58:41] scottoflorida2014: Cover your eyes if you don't want to know how this ends....SNG completes the reverse sweep and wins 3-2
[1:58:42] nathan1127: Do you think rushing ardent on Taric is good?
[1:58:49] Laarouxx: incoming nerfs to ardent -_-
[1:59:00] 420juicelord69: @RUSTYTheCASTER EU ardent trundle is pretty tight
[1:59:07] RustyTheCaster: yeah its fine
[1:59:11] yamamotothegreat: @AngieFoxtrot if KT beat SKT and beat LZ, then SKT get to go to worlds as well right?
[1:59:15] CidIXlol: i hope they bring back top carry for the worlds, tank meta is so boring
[1:59:16] mkonalves: !status
[1:59:16] RustyTheCaster: ardent trundle is surprisingly lit
[1:59:19] Miinimango: Bo3 or 5???
[1:59:27] scottoflorida2014: 5
[1:59:28] sproooot: The nerfs to ardent aren't even bad in fact it's a buff in the early game
[1:59:31] 絕望之人: 5
[1:59:35] kalona45: Will janna nerfs affect her?
[1:59:40] bolthus: one team has two wins....
[1:59:42] 420juicelord69: @rustythecaster I feel like trundle is such a strong flex right now
[1:59:45] AngieFoxtrot: @yamamotothegreat SKT already beat KT

[3:44:07] DaSlushy: @iammeni I mean, Jensen has said it himself that he looks to be better than Bjerg. So, that tells you Bjerg is better... Not by much though. I think Jensen passes him next year, if they don't make Worlds this year. I am a TSM fan but I like watching League

[3:49:25] scottoflorida2014: Oh yeah
[3:49:26] xyz26: You guys are putting no value in the fact that NA LCS has been so competitive this year. Dignitas beat C9, NV almost beat CLG, like obviously the skill gap is minimal, and they are definitely improving as teams overall. NA is definitely stronger than EU, but I think they have a chance of getting out of groups at Worlds no matter who represents the region.
[3:49:29] Elohimrulz: You mean throws to DIG
[3:49:34] michaelsund: Why the fuck is chat only NA fanboys BrokeBack

[3:52:31] scottoflorida2014: Tempt is best Midlaner but his team doesn't carry him like SKT carries Faker. Tempt>Faker confirmed

[3:53:07] kalona45: @gkemonster No, I want FW skins
[3:53:10] scottoflorida2014: @gkemonster SKT wins but they have to play for who gets 2nd and 3rd
[3:53:11] worldclassfeeder: but even if dig get 2nd place they have to gauntlet
[3:53:14] DaSlushy: SKT is back in form... That's not a good sign for the rest of the teams coming up to world
[3:53:15] Laphx: @WorldClassFeeder i think dig is better than clg (especially with omargod), and i don't know about imt, i think it'd be a really fun and competitive bo5 to find out though :)
[3:53:23] mujarshad: @gkemonster china is on the same patch as NA/EU and ahead of KR?
[3:53:47] Gebius: isnt it all 7.16 cait is nerfed everywhere
[3:53:47] Laphx: yes unfortunately if dig gets 2nd they have to go in the gauntlet, because tsm would win off points and dig would have beaten them on the way there...the only way for dig to go to worlds being 2nd is if they faced tsm in the finals
[3:53:50] scottoflorida2014: I think everyone agrees Worlds will go SKT TSM but who gets 3rd
[3:53:58] Laphx: which is impossible
[3:54:02] scottoflorida2014: ;)

[3:54:57] mujarshad: yeah, DIG should win, hauntzer and sven just int some games
[3:54:59] decco41: if SKT dropped two games to KT, i don't think they can be a challenge to TSM or take a single game off TSM
[3:54:59] DrGresh: 👌
[3:55:01] Laphx: the best storyline is dig bating tsm, dig vs clg final, dig beating clg, and running the gauntlet of na lcs champions c9 -> tsm -> clg, to finally win their own
[3:55:02] gkemonster: SKT > LZ/KT > some china team

[4:31:46] Excomm: How is a 5-11 team in the playoffs...
[4:31:48] draco_2341: the only reason they did good in 3-5 is because they put faker on a carry champ

[4:32:10] 그렘린1201: last time jensen said he will clap faker he got SMASHED MingLee
[4:32:16] Avenuee3: @Excomm LPL and group format LUL
[4:32:18] aw_frick: @opieop_dansgame_opieop onlyone reason bjergsen hasn't won worlds is his teammates
[4:32:19] draco_2341: Which didn't let him have pressure and priority LOL
[4:32:19] dorp4: Low price South Korea talents = high potential for a surprise
[4:32:37] BootOfficiaI: galio can have pressure and priority
[4:32:46] OUTPLAYED_PogChamp: 2 kr will reach world finals poor tsm want so delusional
[4:32:50] dorp4: For g2 it looked good at the start
[4:32:50] draco_2341: In game 4 faker was about to double flame horizon pawn lol

[4:33:08] Excomm: So top half of one group is -6? ruyuKEK
[4:33:12] 그렘린1201: TL only won against TSM cause obviouslt regi is close with steve so he told the team to lose on purpose PAID BY STEVE 4Head
[4:33:12] draco_2341: Yes, and that champ can actually fight people early
[4:33:15] Never_Mist: DL is about as good as IMP
[4:33:37] PandanPaisen: who won ig vs sng
[4:33:40] Never_Mist: yea IMP
[4:33:49] mujarshad: @Kyle__twitch he is still the best mid laner, i think it's not that he got worse, but competition has moved closer
[4:33:51] aw_frick: dl > bang
[4:33:59] trikster_14: Ig won

[4:36:44] dorp4: Best just in lpl
[4:36:45] trikster_14: Just explain me this. Why is NB 2-0 already???
[4:36:50] mujarshad: @Kyle__twitch it's hard to do that, until someone finds a new strategy in pro play, it's not possible to gain such huge advantages once the current strategy has been so throughly analyzed
[4:36:51] leon99671: Riot will not make 7 Champion skins for Skt if there are champion LUL

[4:38:04] trikster_14: Yoo why is NB 2-0 already??
[4:38:09] dorp4: Kim un Jong to the lck
[4:38:12] draco_2341: But he needs to not get caught and stuff
[4:38:26] mujarshad: @trikster_14 higher seed gets an extra point in the series
[4:38:33] Fr3nd0: trikster_14 higher seed starts with a 1-0 lead
[4:38:33] Never_Mist: @iammeni yea he is underperforming but theres no way we could know who is better unless we see them vs eachother in lane again
[4:38:36] ademirpajevic: yeah
[4:38:38] trikster_14: Ty
[4:38:44] Laphx: @iSeverity completely agreed
[4:38:57] 그렘린1201: bjersen waiting for that TSM contract to end this year so he can move to korea and play for KT in 2018 Kappa
[4:39:20] aw_frick: @gremlin1201 PogChamp
[4:39:22] mujarshad: @Kyle__twitch yeah, i just don't think it's reasonable to expect him to get the same advantages he used to be able to, that wouldn't mean good things about his competition
[4:39:26] Koti_88: Did IG win?
[4:39:28] Sybyl: vayne farm NotLikeThis

[4:39:51] Koti_88: @Terrorsq I hope KT vs TSM in Quartfinals 4Head
[4:39:55] draco_2341: Makes sense though after what he did to KT
[4:39:57] Never_Mist: @iammeni theres also the language barrier, where it takes him a few seconds to think of how to say something in Chinese, where as originally he could just instantly say it in Korean
[4:39:58] Koti_88: @Terrorsq TSM get crush so bad
[4:40:09] Laphx: idk man pawn is reallyyyyyyyyyyyyy um...lmao, i think bjerg > pawn overall as a player, but if you're looking at it from big picture, with bjerg not speaking korean, losing languages etc, yeah bjerg would be a downgrade
[4:40:27] draco_2341: I really don't like pawn
[4:40:27] Valodercy: PogChamp
[4:40:30] High_IQ_User: LPL > LCK :O

[4:43:21] Funex34: PogChamp
[4:43:31] Laphx: @iSeverity their top half of the map, all speaks korean, and their bot/mid all speak english, and keane being able to go back and forth is a huge plus for them bridging that language gap
