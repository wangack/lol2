[1:23:29] TrashmanV2: UZI? you mean that guy on the bench once every split
[1:23:29] Chainsolol: not even ignoring defts off games
[1:23:32] skadanaa: @b0mbingpanda Let's see Deft + mata vs Uzi + meiko then ahah

[3:33:05] korydallas: @Bandillo64 KT and LZ could dismantle any team other than SKT with no problem, lets be honest, that qualifies as AT LEAST 2 >> better than any other region

[3:41:01] Laphx: @korydallas @scottofl2014 the main criticism i have for her, is that while casting (And this is more so from last year) she would try to talk too much, and try to say and explain absolutely everything she could in a small amt of time, and it would be so annoying and frustrating to listen to
