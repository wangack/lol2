[0:01:31] goblinguy01: We are a bit early. Why did Tencent and LCK have to set time the exact same stream time
[0:01:37] IErTurkI: SA
[0:01:44] IErTurkI: T√úRK VARMI

[0:02:28] goblinguy01: I would think Tecent for owning Riot could have LCK start later
[0:02:37] nickthierry: SEEMS LIKE LCK WAITING ROOM LUL
[0:02:42] goblinguy01: So the viewers can go watch LCK when its starts and catch first 2 games of LCK
[0:02:51] Laado: LCK WAITING ROOM
[0:03:07] Laado: INB4 : SKT 3-2 LONGZHU
[0:03:14] goblinguy01: No
[0:03:22] goblinguy01: We need LZ to win so KT won't win off points
[0:03:42] goblinguy01: I don't want KT to worlds. If they can't beat SKT once, they dont deserve to go to worlds
[0:04:07] stonearrows: hi
[0:04:16] NahDawgDatAintMe: Who do you think will win?
[0:04:32] rudeoff: we
[0:04:33] nickthierry: actually no one can beat skt right now
[0:04:35] goblinguy01: I want SKT to lose, so KT has to win the gauntlet. I think KT will choke again
[0:05:09] NahDawgDatAintMe: I want skt to lose so a first seed gets screwed again
[0:05:19] stonearrows: GO IG
[0:05:23] goblinguy01: Smeb, Score and Deft being bad. They don't deserve worlds.
[0:05:42] NahDawgDatAintMe: FW got a harder group than AHQ last year lol
[0:05:45] goblinguy01: If World Elites win 3rd, are they going to worlds without the gauntlet?
[0:05:52] Laado: press 1 if u longzhu fan
[0:06:03] NahDawgDatAintMe: I think rng needs to win for that to happen
[0:06:08] goblinguy01: FW had Imemes. They couldn't beat Avoidless's Zack
[0:06:08] Laado: 1
[0:06:11] NahDawgDatAintMe: since rng has more points
[0:06:16] goblinguy01: Uzi winning a title PogChamp
[0:06:56] nickthierry: This may be the last chance for UZI to win something
[0:07:02] icn_valid: lck champs today thats all that matters fam
[0:07:27] goblinguy01: Why would you watch SKT 3-0?
[0:07:30] NahDawgDatAintMe: his break was unlucky because he could have won rift rivals
[0:08:25] NahDawgDatAintMe: I am willing to bet Blank will need to reverse sweep again
[0:08:29] goblinguy01: Knowing the outcome of every SKT series, yet braindead NA fans still worship Koreans.
[0:08:52] goblinguy01: You know Koreans don't save the team right? You need teamwork. Look at how bad Profit is playing in NIP
[0:09:01] NahDawgDatAintMe: LPL is the best region right now
[0:09:13] teaacupz: China's been looking a better region for a while. It often goes unlooked.
[0:09:24] GarwinZeus: LPL third place, LCK final, LMS regional qualifier semi, NA & EU semi all in today PogChamp
[0:09:40] goblinguy01: If World Elite 3-0 IG really fast, I will go watch Ogn
[0:09:57] NahDawgDatAintMe: who do you think the third lms team will be?
[0:10:09] goblinguy01: LMS gets a 3rd seed wtf?
[0:10:16] GarwinZeus: J Team
[0:10:16] NahDawgDatAintMe: yes
[0:10:30] goblinguy01: J team always looks shaky in international
[0:10:33] nickthierry: RNG might better than SAMSUNG now , but still not as good as KT ,LONGZHU and SKT
[0:10:35] NahDawgDatAintMe: fofo is a beast
[0:10:41] GarwinZeus: LMS RQ semi today and tmr
[0:11:45] NahDawgDatAintMe: I think RNG can easily take bo1 off those teams
[0:12:02] teaacupz: I agree.
[0:12:13] andy432100: j team sup sucks
[0:12:25] teaacupz: Xiaohu that game 5 yesterday was a masterclass.

[1:13:50] goblinguy01: World Elite needs to secure a worlds spot here
[1:14:45] Smoker_rs: ResidentSleeper
[1:14:47] xlchen1128: WE could not secure, their destiny is on RNG
[1:15:03] xlchen1128: of course, they need to win this set to have a shot to support RNG
[1:15:12] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: If WE gets this, they go into worlds
[1:15:20] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: if they lose, EDG and RNG go
[1:15:22] xlchen1128: nope...they dont
[1:15:30] goblinguy01: We need Uzi to win a title
[1:15:34] xlchen1128: WE WIN still needs RNG to win
[1:15:36] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: yes they do
[1:15:45] goblinguy01: I'm unsure if Uzi can win even with EDG not being the strongest
[1:15:46] Vashnaroth: Heyo
[1:15:49] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: no, EDG was 3rd place in spring while WE was first
[1:16:04] xlchen1128: however both of them will have 160 points
[1:16:09] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: o actually wait ur right
[1:16:13] xlchen1128: summer points have the edge
[1:16:39] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: yeah Kappa I got it wrong
[1:17:03] Beetrayn: RustyFace
[1:17:07] goblinguy01: Uzi winning a title is slim, but its more than 0% this year
[1:17:35] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: What a terrible night to have 3rd place match LOL
[1:17:41] xlchen1128: another curse might be broken...
[1:17:56] xlchen1128: certainly a bad time, LCK FINAL nearby
[1:18:01] goblinguy01: I mean Score isn't getting a title this year
[1:18:07] goblinguy01: Score curse is still here
[1:18:27] Vashnaroth: being Score is suffering
[1:18:30] FishRoeSoup: RNG 40-0 EDG SwiftRage ü§ò
[1:18:38] goblinguy01: Score can't carry KT
[1:18:43] Vashnaroth: perhaps even worse than being Lira
[1:18:43] xlchen1128: Uzi also...
[1:18:51] goblinguy01: Uzi at least has Xiaohu and Ming
[1:19:11] Vashnaroth: Well, Score has Smeb
[1:19:13] goblinguy01: Uzi isn't heavy
[1:19:17] goblinguy01: KT just can't beat SKT
[1:19:25] goblinguy01: Smeb isn't looking that good
[1:19:42] goblinguy01: He can carry, but how do you stop the KT tilt?
[1:19:46] xlchen1128: This might be the "worst" EDG in three years, but still not sure if RNG could prevail
[1:19:52] Vashnaroth: you don't lul
[1:20:06] Vashnaroth: If Xiaohu plays like he did yesterday? Easily.
[1:20:27] Vashnaroth: he literally 1v9'd game 5 yesterday
[1:20:31] goblinguy01: Pretty much needs Clearlove and scout to tilt
[1:20:36] Vashnaroth: and carried Mlxg√¨s corpse
[1:20:40] goblinguy01: Clearlove can tilt as bad as Deft
[1:20:55] xlchen1128: ban his corki...what else?
[1:21:11] FishRoeSoup: h2k: no one tilts as hard as me
[1:21:16] xlchen1128: his corki wont be used in the following matches
[1:21:17] goblinguy01: Leblanc, Lucian?
[1:21:31] Vashnaroth: name a more iconic duo: H2k and semis choke
[1:21:39] stonearrows: Has the first game ended or started yet?
[1:21:41] xlchen1128: G2 and TSM
[1:21:45] goblinguy01: what meme am I missing?
[1:21:47] xlchen1128: hold my beers
[1:21:51] Vashnaroth: yet to start @stonearrows
[1:21:58] stonearrows: @vashnaroth good
[1:22:14] FishRoeSoup: tbh if games with corki go late like yesterday, corki may as well buy a runnan and become shorter range kogmaw
[1:22:36] Vashnaroth: He was playing into kog cassio at 60 minutes and still carried teamfights
[1:22:40] funkyzigueira: is the final today ?
[1:22:46] Vashnaroth: He just went god mode
[1:22:47] winwin311: no
[1:22:58] funkyzigueira: no ? ok thx
[1:22:59] xlchen1128: final is next Sat.
[1:23:00] Vashnaroth: No @funkyzigueira it's next week, today's only 3rd-4th
[1:23:13] FishRoeSoup: was pretty funny how WE lost late game with sej kog cass LUL
[1:23:33] funkyzigueira: Thanks caralho
[1:23:51] Vashnaroth: tbh the whole "Corki is a mid game champ" thing is bollocks rn, his late game damage is bonkers
[1:23:54] FishRoeSoup: JUKE ?? LUL
[1:24:01] xlchen1128: their comp is hard in late games
[1:24:02] winwin311: finals is next friday
[1:24:08] xlchen1128: no protection comp
[1:24:28] stonearrows: why is amumu not meta? thoughts guys?
[1:24:31] wowan116: go go WE :)
[1:24:38] FishRoeSoup: corki used to be mid game champ, but not anymore after 80% magic dmg conversion
[1:24:59] ÁîúÈáéÁöÑÂ∞èËø∑Â¶π: WE's comp was too slow and can't move around while RNG has karma
[1:25:05] Anonymoose321: @stonearrows amumu loses in pressure to literally every other jungler
[1:25:29] ËóçËâ≤È´ÆÂ§æ: Duke and Ning WTF
[1:25:34] Vashnaroth: People really need to pick more Kassadin into Corki, the dmg reduction he gets from his passive on Corki's aa is huge and you take over the splitpush later
[1:25:54] stonearrows: @anonymoose321 just hardfarm to level six, or camp one lane super easy. gotta hit q though
[1:26:00] Vashnaroth: @stonearrows You contest his first blue buff, he's fucked
[1:26:02] ËóçËâ≤È´ÆÂ§æ: Sub in Theshy SwiftRage
[1:26:11] FishRoeSoup: kassawin LUL
[1:26:25] stonearrows: @vashnaroth that's also dependant on his team helping him as well
[1:26:33] Vashnaroth: Also Sejuani is a better Amumu tbh
[1:26:38] stonearrows: @vashnaroth most lcs players don't regularly cheese
[1:26:49] Anonymoose321: @stonearrows he loses duels against every other jungler, his ganks are mediocre, his clear is mediocre, his damage is nonexistant
[1:27:00] FishRoeSoup: the day theshy finally play professionally and there is no more riven BibleThump
[1:27:01] stonearrows: but I main amumu/nocturne
[1:27:12] Vashnaroth: they're ok champs in low elo

[1:27:53] stonearrows: might've dropped tho I didn't play since tuesday
[1:28:12] Anonymoose321: @stonearrows the reason elise is pick/ban right now is because shes the only real pressure jungler in the meta, if one team gets her while the other gets a tank they can impose their will on the map
[1:28:22] PulseIRL: What's up, bitches KonCha
[1:28:28] Anonymoose321: @stonearrows if you pick amumu you make fucking gragas into the elise

[2:39:15] scottoflorida2014: Chat already agreed TSM would win Worlds, the debate was who finishes 2nd and 3rd ;)
[2:39:20] Vashnaroth: To whoever spams about EU and NA: LZ just roflstomped SKT in game 1. Bow down to your Korean overlords, plebes.

[2:41:40] rshawer99: Lmao NA has achieved nothing ever at any international event besides msi with CLG who are probably not even making world. TSM is a perennial worlds failure and an absolute joke on the international stage. TSM didn't even make it out of groups at MSI lmao. At least EU won against WE and gave us a decent series

[2:57:06] DEPRESSED_REI: werent we down like 10k gold
[2:57:14] andreidragutul: @Sunys20087 yesterday

[2:57:32] bsceletic: no wonder, trash gambler
[2:57:34] Merami: esport betting? okay retard confirmed
[2:57:39] wowan116: @hi_imphantomere WE
[2:57:45] stonearrows: xiye is good but only on certain picks, same with ben. ban the right picks and focus on the lower half of the map, and IG can win this
[2:57:49] FishRoeSoup: gamble gtfo 4Head
[2:57:50] andreidragutul: AHahah u so mad kid. I'm done with u
[2:57:55] goblinguy01: What can impressive throw from IG
[2:58:08] goblinguy01: Classic IG, you have faith in then to win. IG proceeds to through Kappa
[2:58:12] Merami: wow you are done with me so cary im about to cry Kappa
[2:58:28] BritishMango: is this best of 3 or 5
[2:58:46] Â∑¥Â±±Èõ®ÂÆ¢: best of 5
[2:58:46] roll1ng1: this is still more fun then the incoming scripted 3-2 skt win again though 4Head
[2:58:51] stonearrows: but 957 is very cocky but loses to IG's top laners in a 1v1 so all IG gotta do top is make sure it stays a 1v1
[2:59:07] Â∑¥Â±±Èõ®ÂÆ¢: lck has been waitting 30 mins
[2:59:25] pnkuU: are there any mods in chat?
[2:59:35] bsceletic: i dont think so
[2:59:36] roll1ng1: scripted skt reverse sweep again im sure
[2:59:39] goblinguy01: IG can't win if Rookie plays this bad and West gets caught out
[2:59:49] goblinguy01: Ning/The Shy cant carry IG. They are too heavy
[2:59:54] pnkuU: @cantspeel @riotpulse ?
[2:59:54] andreidragutul: @roll1ng1 SKT-Longzhou will be a close game bro.But i hope SKT will win cuz i bet on them xD
[3:00:14] goblinguy01: Why does everyone blame West on IG's loses to EDG
[3:00:27] BritishMango: they just said best of 3 wtf
[3:00:41] andreidragutul: Its not BO3 its BO5
[3:00:44] goblinguy01: Rookie was actually Afk game 5, Duke did nothing all series. Without the Shy, Meghan and Ning - IG would have lost 3-1 easily
[3:00:46] FishRoeSoup: @goblibguy01 coz its easier to see a clip than whole game for some ppl
[3:00:52] cantspeel: HeyGuys
[3:00:54] Â∑¥Â±±Èõ®ÂÆ¢: no,i think it will be best of 3,this is finals 3rd place
[3:01:00] stonearrows: west is positioning vad but rookie is just getting tilted to be honest, and that is on him. the game could swing either way statistically
[3:01:05] Â∑¥Â±±Èõ®ÂÆ¢: best of '
[3:01:09] Â∑¥Â±±Èõ®ÂÆ¢: best of 5
[3:01:11] chrysopelea: when its Bo5 and they are both 1-1 its essentially a best of 3 FailFish
[3:01:12] andreidragutul: They said this will be BO5
[3:01:15] Â∑¥Â±±Èõ®ÂÆ¢: sry for mistaking
[3:01:18] goblinguy01: @FishRoeSoup I watched the entire series, and the only good Korean playing that whole series was The Shy. Rookie and Duke tilted
[3:01:25] roll1ng1: @andreidragutul good luck. i bet skt map1 lul but i won on ig map and we map2 even a livebet on we map2 at odds 5+ lul
[3:01:27] pnkuU: @cantspeel can you fix ingame sound? it's incredibly quiet in comparison to the cast :/
[3:01:33] cantspeel: sure!
[3:01:37] cantspeel: ty for feedback
[3:01:40] pnkuU: great! <3
[3:01:45] goblinguy01: Is that Mistake?
[3:01:48] andreidragutul: @roll1ng1 I have 50$ on WE and SKT combo.
[3:01:49] FishRoeSoup: @goblibguy01 yeah rookie somehow kept getting caught out or fk up randomly
[3:02:03] stonearrows: rookie tilts too easy he just needs to chill. if ning camps mid they can turn around his attitude
[3:02:19] goblinguy01: @FishRoeSoup I feel like Duke isn't trying. The Shy is much better with less experience. Solo que player who outperforms a world champion lol
[3:02:23] stonearrows: but counter ganking is alsk a thing
[3:02:24] andreidragutul: @roll1ng1 Yesterday WE fucked me hard i had a ticket with 100$ to win almost 500$.I had 3 games and WE fucked me.
[3:02:34] roll1ng1: @andreidragutul nice hope it hits.. i am just betting maps after the draft and doing livebets
[3:02:42] TriHard_up_a_tree: CRAWLING ON YOUR KNEES SwiftRage
[3:02:50] goblinguy01: Rookie was the main reason why IG lost to EDG, not West. West is a rookie, let him make mistakes
[3:03:10] Ê∞¥Êû™ÂëÜÊØõ: Kappa
[3:03:15] goblinguy01: Just don't let Duke play, I hope IG's coaching staff understands that
[3:03:23] roll1ng1: @andreidragutul ouch unlucky man
[3:03:29] stonearrows: west is a rookie but his positioning isn't a rookie mistake, that's just lack of game knowledge in general
[3:03:37] andreidragutul: @roll1ng1 WE played very bad and i'm pretty scared again...They got lucky but they played bad.I really think SKT will win easy but WE...
[3:03:46] stonearrows: yeah duke is bad let theshy play
[3:04:08] goblinguy01: West, TheShy, and Ning are allowed to make mistakes
[3:04:14] the_wrong_guy: 'MURICA! FUCK YEAH
[3:04:21] stonearrows: @just_an_engineer_kappa WE
[3:04:21] roll1ng1: @andreidragutul agreed IG definetely played better overall so far but might be tilted after that throw just now
[3:04:23] andreidragutul: @just_an_engineer_kappa WE
[3:04:27] goblinguy01: Duke and Rookie can't make mistakes imo. They are veterans and need to be leaders
[3:05:05] andreidragutul: @roll1ng1 SKT should take second game easy.I'm not even worried.
[3:05:09] stonearrows: @roll1ng1 they got lucky with yasuo, they just need to stick to the meta, late game kayn is what threw (west positioning didn't help)
[3:05:24] goblinguy01: Mystic positioning was so bad this game. Xiye carried WE's dead bodies to the finish
[3:05:32] goblinguy01: 957 and Xiye carried World Elite
[3:05:36] andreidragutul: @stonearrows That Penta kill won the game.
[3:06:03] stonearrows: it got corki fed. but corki with cc is easy to focus
[3:06:16] roll1ng1: @andreidragutul i am not so sure.. skt looked awful in game1 but maybe with the sub they will turn it around like they did vs kt
[3:06:19] BritishMango: I want team WE to win ):
[3:06:42] stonearrows: use vlads all inning to blow corki w, vlad w out, then alistar cc and he's dead
[3:06:42] BritishMango: WE hasnt been to worlds since season 2
[3:06:54] goblinguy01: I want WE to win, but they need to play better. The Shy carried them in quarters and Semis. They refuse to play him FailFish
[3:07:01] stonearrows: @britishmango they wont Kappa
[3:07:12] goblinguy01: Last big event World Elite won was IpL5 with their all-star line up and various side events
[3:07:26] ESTEpo: Lpl finals or skt v. longzhu. Why must i choose why!! BibleThump
[3:07:41] cantspeel: lpl finals are next week
[3:07:47] goblinguy01: West and Rookie throwing xD
[3:07:50] stonearrows: @goblibguy01 theshy is on IG?
[3:08:05] goblinguy01: The Shy is an IG sub to Duke
[3:08:16] stonearrows: the shy > duke
[3:08:32] goblinguy01: Duke = Lose
[3:08:32] roll1ng1: poor shy he is way better then duke imo but sitting on the bench
[3:08:33] ESTEpo: @cantspeel haha!! thank you good sir or miss or wathever you asociate yourself with!!
[3:08:57] goblinguy01: I really hope Kid retires. He is holding the main roster spot for so many good Chinese junglers
[3:09:07] stonearrows: sub the shy in, ning camp mid, bot play the late game (cough kalista) and IG can win every game
[3:09:34] goblinguy01: Don't give West Kogmaw and give Rookie a Galio. You can win
[3:10:10] stonearrows: rookie needs to lock in cass or corki and he wins mid 99:
[3:10:22] stonearrows: 99%*
[3:10:50] tuckfepz: when is dp's match?
[3:10:52] goblinguy01: World Elite didn't ban Corki, hmm
[3:10:59] stonearrows: west lucian into cass thresh
[3:11:04] stonearrows: imo
[3:11:21] stonearrows: nvm kog range
[3:12:01] stonearrows: I like the lack of shtipost memes in this compared to NA lcs games, good community
[3:12:14] goblinguy01: LPL is good ^^

[3:58:32] mujarshad: nah, rng has to win, if rng loses they are second seed
[3:58:34] FishRoeSoup: so they can probably win
[3:58:43] 77hockey: if Royal wins, and WE loses, EDG gets 2nd seed because they'll have more points than WE.
