[0:01:49] happyfoxvivi: ^
[0:01:51] Austiu: kk ty
[0:01:51] chrysopelea: It would really suck if WE didn't make it
[0:02:20] yanglocke: lol all of the we squad look so derpy in that group photo
[0:02:30] 澀谷凜: Squid1 Squid3 bang
[0:02:49] SugarSlapper: Everyone looks derpy except for Rookie Kreygasm
[0:02:55] yanglocke: yep lol
[0:02:58] chrysopelea: mystic looks drugged up
[0:03:04] yanglocke: rookie looks a bit like pobelter
[0:03:34] SugarSlapper: yea he does look a little like pob
[0:03:37] SippyTango: what region is lpl? i only watch lck
[0:03:39] happyfoxvivi: looks like they got the proportions wrong when shopping everyone in
[0:03:44] chrysopelea: China
[0:03:56] SippyTango: cool thx
[0:04:04] yanglocke: @twerkyoulater yea lol IG's jungler looks massive
[0:04:15] SugarSlapper: LUL
[0:04:19] SippyTango: ii was about to lose faith in many races if this was eu
[0:04:22] happyfoxvivi: yea and WE's mid laner's head is like half the side of everryone elses
[0:04:27] happyfoxvivi: size
[0:04:32] happyfoxvivi: and supp
[0:04:46] happyfoxvivi: or maybe hes top
[0:04:56] SugarSlapper: Both Junglers are bigger than the rest of the team lol
[0:05:06] SippyTango: how does lpl line up in worlds?
[0:05:10] SugarSlapper: IG's a little more than WE's though
[0:05:15] SippyTango: any good prospects?
[0:05:21] yanglocke: lpl is known as the 2nd best region
[0:05:22] chrysopelea: probably second best region
[0:05:22] SugarSlapper: They get smashed by KR, like everyone else
[0:05:32] yanglocke: they disappoint at worlds tho
[0:05:39] yanglocke: usually 1 or 2 get out of groups
[0:05:42] SippyTango: right on
[0:05:58] chrysopelea: they were better a couple years back
[0:05:59] SippyTango: that ssg round 3 was nuts last night
[0:06:03] yanglocke: and theyre pretty unlucky for getting vs KR in quarters all the time
[0:06:15] SugarSlapper: SSG destroying KT in gauntlet again LUL
[0:06:29] SippyTango: dude that round 3 was clutch as fuck
[0:06:32] yanglocke: i cant believe kt isnt going to worlds
[0:06:42] chrysopelea: Uzi just needs the bracket gods to favor him and he can realize his destiny of the third time getting 2nd place in worlds
[0:06:47] SugarSlapper: KT choked too hard
[0:06:49] yanglocke: its literally the top talent ever on a single team
[0:06:50] chrysopelea: BlessRNG
[0:06:53] SugarSlapper: not as hard as RNG did
[0:07:11] SugarSlapper: but still choked pretty good
[0:07:12] GetToTheLantern: KT THROWSTER LUL
[0:07:18] chrysopelea: Uzi still has worlds to get 2nd again BlessRNG
[0:07:21] SippyTango: LZ is doing fantastic for a "new" team
[0:07:27] GetToTheLantern: 50 min DansGame DansGame
[0:07:34] SippyTango: kahn is beasting
[0:07:36] shenbot111: IG is gonna win LUL fuck WE
[0:07:39] happyfoxvivi: SourPls
[0:07:45] SugarSlapper: Its because KESPA took over the team
[0:07:50] yanglocke: LZ is insane talent as well, probably 2nd best talent of any team ever besides KT
[0:07:59] SugarSlapper: the chinese people running the org fucked everything up
[0:08:01] narvuntien: these two are the ones with the best chance right or is there EDG and RNG to go after this?
[0:08:03] yanglocke: although you could make a case for SSB and SSW
[0:08:19] yanglocke: edg and rng are already in worlds
[0:08:22] SippyTango: im a hufanboy more than a skt farrs
[0:08:31] SippyTango: hope this tank meta ends soon so he gets of the bench
[0:08:31] SugarSlapper: This is the gauntlet final, right?
[0:08:36] SippyTango: huni
[0:08:40] Nandominator: 10 Fakers?
[0:08:43] yanglocke: yea
[0:08:47] happyfoxvivi: idk id say talent became more concentrated after SSW/B
[0:08:52] yanglocke: tbh untara is a better overall player
[0:08:53] happyfoxvivi: cause no more sister teams
[0:09:04] SippyTango: yeah untara is doing really well
[0:09:04] SugarSlapper: Huni might not get taken to Worlds tho FeelsBadMan
[0:09:06] yanglocke: its not like he cant play carries
[0:09:08] chrysopelea: we need a 2nd korean exodus to weak KR
[0:09:18] yanglocke: huni pops off more because skt dumps resources into him
[0:09:21] SippyTango: hes just safer
[0:09:23] sdjj1033: IG 2 Koreans PogChamp cannot lose
[0:09:28] happyfoxvivi: huni is good and all but i think the huni/RO synergy si what made them both shine so much
[0:09:29] chrysopelea: the NA franchising money BlessRNG please
[0:09:30] SippyTango: huni is less predictable
[0:09:34] SugarSlapper: If EU had more money, we could weaken KR just enough, I think
[0:09:47] mpmagic: Huni needs to come to NA if he wants playing time
[0:09:55] SippyTango: yeah. same with peanut. theyre out of their comfort zone
[0:10:02] SugarSlapper: Huni could go back to EU tbh
[0:10:09] yanglocke: skt have never succeeded with a carry jungler
[0:10:15] yanglocke: i dont think peanut fits too well
[0:10:17] SugarSlapper: NA tops are pretty fucking good now
[0:10:24] SippyTango: they just need a safe team
[0:10:30] chrysopelea: Huni won't even get a worlds skin FeelsBadMan even if SKT wins
[0:10:39] chrysopelea: LUL
[0:10:48] yanglocke: i just want a team with khan/smeb rotating toplaners, score, faker, pray and gorilla
[0:10:52] SippyTango: no skt rumble
[0:11:07] Amarak_: peanut is gonna be fine
[0:11:31] sdjj1033: huni won't make it to worlds FeelsBadMan
[0:11:37] chrysopelea: I wonder what kind of opening ceremony we have today
[0:11:46] chrysopelea: the last 2 were fire
[0:11:48] yanglocke: peanut is good at experimenting because he goes to his limit of aggression a lot of the time, and that gives blank a lot of info when he subs in
[0:11:56] chrysopelea: CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:11:57] hiephero: TSM will win worlds 2017 FeelsAmazingMan
[0:12:04] SugarSlapper: I wonder if West is gonna flash under turret as Kog again LUL
[0:12:06] SippyTango: is china production anything like koria?
[0:12:11] SippyTango: korea
[0:12:14] Forlorn_God: @hiephero LUL
[0:12:25] chrysopelea: they put on a show
[0:12:26] sdjj1033: I'm sure TSM will win worlds before I die = easiest way to be immortal
[0:12:26] yanglocke: its ok
[0:12:27] SugarSlapper: It's a little worse
[0:12:33] SippyTango: dude i thought papa was gonna go kick mata's ass in game 2
[0:12:36] happyfoxvivi: its enjoyable imo
[0:12:37] yanglocke: im pretty sure casters are based in sydney?
[0:12:41] SippyTango: n spank him
[0:12:45] SugarSlapper: Not much worse, its still pretty good
[0:12:45] yanglocke: but they might have gone to beijing for playoffs
[0:12:48] DrHonker: drhonkS drhonkS drhonkS
[0:12:51] hiephero: @Forlorn_God keep that lul to urself, NA is stronger than ever PogChamp
[0:12:54] chrysopelea: China has cheerleaders so they auto win

[0:13:50] sdjj1033: EU LUL NA LuL
[0:13:51] SugarSlapper: Kappa
[0:13:57] SippyTango: i wanted to see AFS go to worlds. i like those guys
[0:13:58] chrysopelea: My boys Gambit Gaming are gonna make it far
[0:14:18] SugarSlapper: I want Jin Air, AFS, and KT at worlds
[0:14:35] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: Does winner of this go to worlds?
[0:14:39] yanglocke: tbh korea, china and all of the major regions have to work harder to close the gap between them and Oceania, it's really not any competition and its not fun watching OCE stomp every game
[0:14:43] SugarSlapper: But I also don't want worlds to be LCK Fall split
[0:15:10] SugarSlapper: Winner goes to Worlds, loser is China's KT
[0:15:21] SippyTango: dude the ban phase of ssg/kt was vanilla as fuck
[0:15:24] I_GOT_MILK_ON_MY_KEYBOARD: too soooooon.
[0:15:41] yanglocke: kt were clueless in that series idek
[0:15:56] SugarSlapper: KT fans on suicide watch FeelsBadMan 🔫
[0:15:58] SippyTango: that game 3 was crazy
[0:16:04] hundr3dsna: Score coming to NA
[0:16:09] SippyTango: i might watch it again
[0:16:15] yanglocke: game 1 and 2 KT looked like they were crazy
[0:16:20] SugarSlapper: Score coming to Dignitoss Kreygasm
[0:16:21] mpmagic: is jackylove still the future of iG?
[0:16:31] SippyTango: mata died in like first 2 mins
[0:16:37] NiceRex602: FeelsGoodMan super teams always fail
[0:16:49] SugarSlapper: KT was a super team of chokers
[0:16:51] yanglocke: lol remember the TSM superteam with yellowstar
[0:16:58] SugarSlapper: LUL
[0:17:01] hundr3dsna: @iamthe4thhokage I could see that too bad st vicious has a fetish for shrimp
[0:17:01] NiceRex602: what?
[0:17:01] DolphinPriest: #WEWIN VoHiYo
[0:17:10] NiceRex602: you call that a super team FailFish
[0:17:19] yanglocke: for NA it was
[0:17:19] SugarSlapper: ikr, shrimp is sucha waste of an import
[0:17:35] NiceRex602: absolutely not
[0:17:39] SugarSlapper: Then they finished 6th
[0:17:47] yanglocke: what superteams have there been in NA
[0:17:50] SugarSlapper: LUL
[0:17:50] hiephero: LuL > LUL
[0:17:51] yanglocke: its relative mate
[0:17:55] DolphinPriest: LUL
[0:18:00] NiceRex602: none thats the point
[0:18:08] yanglocke: obviously you dont compare it to KT LOL
[0:18:22] SugarSlapper: TSM summer 2016 was a super team Kappa
[0:18:23] Vennntil: LuL Masterrace
[0:18:29] yanglocke: but in terms of NA teams it was a group of talent not seen before
[0:18:31] NiceRex602: LGD was supposed to be really good
[0:18:35] yanglocke: and they failed miserably
[0:18:48] mintkmz: is this english stream?
[0:18:54] SippyTango: nope
[0:18:54] SugarSlapper: SSong will take NA to the promised land
[0:18:56] NiceRex602: id say IMT 2016 was more of a Superteam than tsm spring 2016
[0:18:58] Cesunana: stop bringing up the LGD example...they had no coaching staff and zero infrastructure for that split
[0:19:00] yanglocke: actually tbh s3/4 C9 and LMQ could have been NA superteams but it was too early for it
[0:19:01] SippyTango: oh the stream
[0:19:08] mintkmz: ok twitch said nope means yes
[0:19:11] sadfacenospace: whod IG beat yesterday to move forward?
[0:19:18] mintkmz: omg
[0:19:21] Cesunana: @lolHitsuyaga yes it's English stream
[0:19:22] SugarSlapper: They smacked OMG
[0:19:52] sadfacenospace: oh word..i love rookie but i like WE more than IG :(
[0:20:05] yanglocke: im not sure if huni/reign/pob/turtle/adrian is as big as hauntzer/sven/bjerg/double/yellowstar
[0:20:10] SugarSlapper: IG is actually kind of scary tbh
[0:20:11] hiephero: EU ResidentSleeper NA BrokeBack GPL PogChamp
[0:20:17] SippyTango: i dunno any of these dudes. whos the best one on the screen right now?
[0:20:19] yanglocke: i think bjerg double yellowstar themselves contest the IMT lineup
[0:20:22] SugarSlapper: after that beat down yesterday
[0:20:28] NiceRex602: superteams are when orgs pay insane money for the on-paper great players and then they find out that its more about team play than solo mechanical players
[0:20:30] yanglocke: but IMT had the insane huni reignover synergy so theres that
[0:20:39] SugarSlapper: The guy in the front on IG is the best midlaner in China
[0:20:46] sadfacenospace: yellowstar was dog shit in na..even in EU kinda trash just outside game stuff he brings..that TSM didnt need
[0:20:47] Cesunana: by this chat's logic TL has had the biggest superteams in the world LUL
[0:20:48] ga2006187329: WutFace
[0:21:00] SippyTango: ill call him chaker
[0:21:01] hiephero: GPL is gonna win worlds this year PogChamp
[0:21:04] yanglocke: but pob/WT/adrian arent amazing on paper players though
[0:21:30] larpsouls: IM GAY HeyGuys IM GAY HeyGuys IM GAY HeyGuys IM GAY HeyGuys IM GAY HeyGuys
[0:21:32] Cesunana: saying rookie is the best mid in China like its a fact LUL
[0:21:42] yanglocke: still yellowstar is a massive name and contested hai in terms of best western shotcaller
[0:21:45] NiceRex602: @Cesunana TL doesnt buy good players though FailFish
[0:21:48] rebeccamo: 37 years ResidentSleeper
[0:21:58] SippyTango: i like 4th homeboy on red's hairdoo. whos he?

[0:22:12] larpsouls: damn you guys are majorlly homophobic
[0:22:13] EmpressXenia: !songpls
[0:22:18] yanglocke: TL buys upcoming talent who absolutely pop off AFTER they get away from TL
[0:22:33] sadfacenospace: yellowstar was trash overrated dog shit huni and RO made look good
[0:22:33] NiceRex602: TriHard / \ MingLee lets do what we do
[0:22:34] Cesunana: @NiceRex602 by your logic its all about orgs creating super teams with massive amounts of money, im just pointing out how fallacious your argument is
[0:22:35] EmpressXenia: is it just me or do their heads look squished down
[0:22:38] SugarSlapper: What TL players have popped off after leaving?
[0:22:39] larpsouls: bunch of porn addicts
[0:22:41] sadfacenospace: rekkles carried the lane
[0:22:53] SugarSlapper: TL is where your career goes to die man, and i like TL
[0:23:01] Cesunana: saying xiaohu is trash when he won mvp
[0:23:06] Cesunana: someone is salty LUL
[0:23:23] yanglocke: how is yellowstar trash lol
[0:23:26] SugarSlapper: You know it. I AM from NA after all Kappa
[0:23:28] fepl_: Rookie go to worlds BlessRNG
[0:23:36] sdjj1033: where is DODOSIN
[0:23:36] yanglocke: if you look in hindsight of his last seasons then yeah he was declining
[0:23:48] SippyTango: whats 4th guy on red play? he the adc?
[0:23:52] yanglocke: but yellowstar is hall of fame level influential to the EU scene
[0:23:54] SugarSlapper: WE are really good but I want Rookie at Worlds again NotLikeThis
