[2:22:20] M012345678: @kalariax fly vs c9 yesterday was so sad to watch, "top teams", it was utter destruction, players played remotely, without player cams, the casters tried to call it a hype game but it was just sad
[2:22:27] federationonfire999: AYAYA
[2:22:28] Kalariax: It's just looking at the enemy items and game knowledge and making a guess from that.
[2:22:32] captainkrajick: @jumpwave why would it be rigged? also they can calculate and estimate lmao
[2:22:35] jumpwave: dang im still learning lpl bro
