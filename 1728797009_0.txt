[3:51:57] DkAgent: @captainkrajick so you're saying 2 matches are playing all at once/
[3:52:03] sajadam4: when does carry junglers become meta again I'm tired of seeing good players like canyon and bo play sej,mokai
[3:52:04] lukee7_: next game will be delayed?
[3:52:08] lucieroad: what is the name of gaming chair the gamer seating on?
[3:52:18] M012345678: @sleepingkisa Well they gotta learn some day Sadge
[3:52:19] captainkrajick: @DkAgent the matches will start at their scheduled time if the games are in different stadiums
[3:52:34] DkAgent: @m012345678 exactly I don't need to watch the game to see who wins, I only need results
[3:52:43] captainkrajick: @DkAgent but the last game will be held until the LNG series is done, even though they are in a different stadium

[3:53:21] baby_yoda004: is this stream that late ??
[3:53:27] M012345678: @baby_yoda004 Stare
[3:53:34] mcrdisco: @baby_yoda004 delayed, in the LPL they play in different stadiums, so sometimes teams start while another match is still going, and you just catch up by shortening breaks, and pick/ban
[3:53:37] captainkrajick: !delay
[3:53:37] Moobot: @captainkrajick Because the previous set(s) ran over their scheduled time, this match is being broadcasted on a delay. Casters have no advanced knowledge other than ban/pick. SPOILERS WILL BE TIMED OUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS SERIES, and channel point betting will be disabled.
[3:53:45] fry3via: @baby_yoda004 STare

[3:56:04] CertainlySomeoneHere: It's alsok inda funny people think that the english cast shouldn't cover all games? like the ponit of an english cast is to make sure all games have an english cast on them
[3:56:31] captainkrajick: they want the cast to serve their needs and needs only

[3:58:17] POGB0i: ohhh i get why the delay, is it cause you cant like sync up both schedules of the caster crew (english and chinese) so there will be a delay when one crew runs longer than the other?
[3:58:30] lucieroad: Does anyone know the gaming chair they are seating ?
