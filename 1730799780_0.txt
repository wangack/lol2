[4:28:34] itsmeandyv: this song is awful
[4:28:35] connorlol1: @Leanback_tv yea looks like an amateur championship
[4:28:49] Moonjisuu: @mtownhustler043_ It was just their decision making or they were not on same page
[4:28:59] pyro_kertok: @sh0tdawg So the whole game is RIOT trash tier untill we get rid of August, Phlox, hwole balance team and Auberant? Got it
[4:29:01] Bankshot978_: Just like your hairline
[4:29:01] Leanback_tv: @Leanback_tv it just disturbs the broadcast, when one of them is much louder than the other.

[4:33:08] Healore: E spammer player of the game ICANT
[4:33:14] pyro_kertok: @Eijnarb ZE RIOT
[4:33:23] Moonjisuu: @sh0tdawg Draft matters but also decision making and planning ahead matters in the most when you are in-game so It is players who are decision making and pros feel the pressure because of the competition and it is stressful to deal with a pro playing zeri or lucian
[4:33:57] Moonjisuu: @sh0tdawg As you can see ruler's zeri with yuumi
[4:34:06] ÁßÄ‰∫∫: @rickhy10 second
[4:34:35] pandoralight24: that why we like the lpl
[4:34:40] Healore: do you guys remember that brief period when Riot dumpstered this champ and we were Zeri free
[4:34:42] pyro_kertok: @sh0tdawg too many things to ban (reason why so many people want 2 bans per person) + teams prioritize banning other ADCs, like Varus or Caitlyn
[4:34:45] daniel_wenerxi: The volume of the casters is a little low
[4:34:46] connorlol1: UP 2-0 GG

[4:34:54] Moonjisuu: @sh0tdawg I don't understand that either why coaches decide to ban every other adc but not zeri
[4:35:20] dmallsong: Are games over?
[4:35:25] connorlol1: @sh0tdawg agreed, think zeri has morry carry potential than varus for example
[4:35:28] pyro_kertok: @LoreleiDiAngelo You mean the 1 patch before August cried that she belongs in Pro?
[4:35:29] jh_053017: @123ioannis123 yes brother
[4:35:35] Binxy17: @dmallsong one more
[4:35:35] connorlol1: @dmallsong no
[4:35:37] Healore: Caitlyn is stronk, banning Varus feels like a self-own tho
