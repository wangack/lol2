[2:27:26] hiragiuzu: its bad normally yes but since zeri doesnt play for early game aphelios lulu = guaranteed scaling and better 2v2
[2:27:29] nastyrustyboi: How many kills did FoFo have game 1?
[2:27:54] hiragiuzu: even draven lulu would destroy her

[2:34:41] hiragiuzu: if i learned anything from the last 3 worlds, theres never clear victors especially based on last year where everything was pure chaos
[2:34:48] pyro_kertok: @hiragiuzu If one team gets Zeri, they win.
[2:35:28] hiragiuzu: jdg getting hard gapped, tes not even making it out of groups due to a bug, rng getting covid gapped, nothing could've foresaw that based on how they played in playoffs
[2:35:31] Darin9696: the sound is so low
[2:35:36] DkAgent: @hiragiuzu so last year T1 suppose to be the true winners, 2021 should've been DK
[2:35:36] Moobot: The casters of today are Oisin (https://twitter.com/JustOisin_) and Nymaera (https://twitter.com/Nymaera)!
[2:36:07] linxsis4: @hiragiuzu So how does pick work for game 3? Does it go to EDG or NIP first? bc im guessing whoever picks this zeri wins straight up
[2:36:11] hiragiuzu: nah JDG shouldve steamrolled T1 based on how much better they were than rng but it went nowhere near close to that
