[3:11:35] stephcurrysim: yeah kitty needs a lot of work on her colour casting, i feel like she doesn't take improving seriously, she's happier w all the hype around her looks and playing into that as opposed to watching the region she's covering

[3:12:38] chunkELuva: Thank you before all the fan girls come back some people talking sense
[3:13:30] stephcurrysim: i think people will start to be more realistic about her casting once the initial hype dies down, if she doesn't improve by the end of the split it'll become a headache to listen to
