[4:29:59] mainanalyst: @theraiderrr you have support item. If playing twitch support you have 3 support items and you farm champions.
[4:30:00] mordicai1992: ok but like, isnt it confirmed at higher ranks minons spawn more often to the wave? or is it just cause pros clear the wave so fast
[4:30:06] gahojooo: off pls FailFish

[4:30:51] myprecioussosnowy: @mordicai1992 no dude, they just sent him to a side lane when it's stacked, it's like funneling but not really
[4:30:59] theraiderrr: @mainanalyst yeah but I can take minions until the gold warning comes
[4:31:01] mainanalyst: @mordicai1992 Not sure what you mean @mordicai1992 minions are the wave

[4:32:23] dumbbai: let me do it for you
[4:32:29] mainanalyst: @theraiderrr fair enough, try different lane then :) Or if playing Twitch support you dont want to farm minions at all because it reveals your location.
[4:32:33] dumbbai: honey
[4:32:34] myprecioussosnowy: it looks like gg
[4:32:37] mordicai1992: so 2 champs with 200 farm at 20 min is just perfect map awareness and vision. got it
