[0:24:56] GymLeaderKevin: you gotta appreciate every detail this way
[0:25:35] STNbond: man it looks like shit compared to the trailers for it
[0:25:55] Garrity130: game is very wonky. needs optimization
[0:27:03] reverendrustle: didnt lag like this when i was playing it lol
[0:27:04] yrvengalied: Yup lots of F Bombs
[0:27:11] GymLeaderKevin: damn
[0:27:13] dreamingmustard: MrDestructoid
[0:27:14] yrvengalied: its like Forspoken bad LUL
[0:27:20] Garrity130: damn talk about gut punching a game
[0:27:28] MerxAndCheese: Yeah people said Forspoken vibes
[0:27:30] zerohour_88: the kiosk lady PepeLaugh
[0:28:10] DaRandalizer: Russia bad
[0:28:25] Garrity130: just say it JP you have to risk offence to have an opinion
[0:28:28] yrvengalied: yup
[0:28:32] Hemry64_: Just cause the devs are Russian?
[0:28:44] MerxAndCheese: The first I heard about it was Cohh’s vid and I was surprised
[0:28:58] Ardailec: @Hemry64_ That and the game was essentially bankrolled by the Russian Government
[0:29:04] zerohour_88: reading twitter comments PepeLaugh
[0:29:06] Garrity130: wait so the devs are from Ukraine?
[0:29:13] JBfromAccounting: @hemry64_ it's because there's a lot of financial ties to the Russian govt in various ways
[0:29:22] Garrity130: oh
[0:29:25] Garrity130: oh shet
[0:29:34] Sunless00: how sexy are these robots though.. cohhSus
[0:29:35] Shin_gx: catJAM
[0:29:38] DaRandalizer: Cohs take on the situation is good, though
[0:29:42] joyousboyous: I think so, its sick
[0:29:46] zerohour_88: Mick Gordon catJAM
[0:30:02] GymLeaderKevin: we're used to it with warzone
[0:30:03] Kaleith: shader pre-compilation POGGERS
[0:30:04] ItsNoxid: lot of games doing the shaders now
[0:30:14] Kaleith: but it's a good thing
[0:30:15] Rajrajlasse: isn't it related to more games using "vulkan" ?
[0:30:18] heltvild: to pre install shaders and build the cahce so you dont have to loadi t every time
[0:30:21] woofser: Isn't a DirectX 12 thing?
[0:30:25] m3rcer: it helps with loading textures/shaders
[0:30:25] DaRandalizer: because of stutterstruggle
[0:30:27] reverendrustle: itll stutter if it doesnt compile em
[0:30:27] RhodesToRome: I think it's to reduce loading
[0:30:27] BrianEddy: it removes shader compilation stutters
[0:30:29] summerspeak: DirectX 12 changed things
[0:30:33] Zieth: they don't have to compile them during the game which can cause stutters
[0:30:46] Garrity130: Ive been wondering the same thing
[0:30:55] DaRandalizer: against stuttering due to shader compilation
[0:30:55] thanh_n2004: i think so
[0:30:55] Kaleith: they need to be compiled based on your hardware, they can either do that on the fly (but it can cause shader stutter) or you do that and pre-compile them
[0:30:55] moist_heinous: Doesn't warframe does this?
[0:31:06] MetalMaiden5150: @itmejp I’m hoping u can answer this for me. Should I beat midnight suns before the Deadpool dlc or can I save the last mission for after all the dlc?
[0:31:17] Tistenpulle: So did JP find that last orb thingy last noght?
[0:31:35] JeedanJune: i think dx12 is a byproduct. I think its more that Devs are getting better at squeezing out performance with certain things
[0:31:35] yrvengalied: During
[0:31:44] Shin_gx: @MetalMaiden5150 you can do them anytime, its just a mission you choose in the war table
[0:31:47] Sunless00: it can't do that in the initial install process to begin with? weird
[0:32:03] RhodesToRome: 70 FOV KEKW
[0:32:04] UnboundSouls: no fov? im out
[0:32:11] heltvild: nope
[0:32:11] ZeroHeat: At least it's Unreal engine, can just tweak the ini
[0:32:12] ItsNoxid: ???????
[0:32:13] GymLeaderKevin: no fov slider
[0:32:17] Mallatom: 2023 btw xdd
[0:32:18] leovic1: it also has mouse accel
[0:32:19] JeedanJune: probably because it loads certain assets on launch of game instead of on install, not sure everyone does it different @Sunless00
[0:32:19] Hemry64_: Gonna have to skyrim console fov this NotLikeThis
[0:32:19] Booba__TV: lmao 70 FOV in 2023
[0:32:20] kalTorakSF: nope
[0:32:21] MetalMaiden5150: @itmejp @shin_gx thanks you so much
[0:32:22] Julia: technology isnt there yet danJulia hey
[0:32:24] estebanstrangiato: it gets worse
[0:32:26] Shin_gx: At least Deadpool you can start it anytime, Venom isnt out yet so no idea, and depends on story (which i wont spoil)
[0:32:27] heltvild: but its UE so you can edit it in .ini file LUL
[0:32:29] ItsNoxid: lol

[0:33:27] Garrity130: yup
[0:33:35] Temu1982: @itmeJP he has a rant with fps and I do believe he had one with fov sliders missing from games
[0:33:36] Ardailec: TB had many rants in his day.
[0:33:36] Havesh: Man, I sure hope the place TB has gone to, has an FoV slider!
[0:33:39] ok_juju: FOV sliders yes it was a big deal for him
[0:33:45] Hemry64_: Can you at least use the console to change FOV like Skyrim?
[0:33:56] ectoplasma111: @itmeJP are you actually playing Blood Bowl or is it a joke?
[0:34:04] JeedanJune: @JeedanJune a little of column A and a little of column B KEKW
[0:34:13] ectoplasma111: i thought you slept through the trailer because you thought its omeag boring LUL
[0:34:18] Havesh: One of the main reasons why FoV sliders were big for him, was because he had simulation sickness issues.
[0:34:20] ectoplasma111: i watch trailer time every week!
[0:34:32] bakavic: what??
[0:34:32] JeedanJune: this looks like a game that tried to be Bioshock but didn't quiet make it
[0:34:33] SMonTwitch: wtff
[0:34:33] Shin_gx: @MetalMaiden5150 Deadpool will also comment on the stuff happening in the story which is pretty cool and is pretty funny, no idea how theyll do it for Venom because of story reasons but the missions we got with Deadpool were fun so far and his character is really fun

[0:36:07] Garrity130: in what world is that acceptable for pc gaming?
[0:36:09] ItsNoxid: its 4k
[0:36:14] AceAssegai: at max settings
[0:36:14] ectoplasma111: hes running a 2080 in 4k
[0:36:15] McLafferty09: on a steam deck though
[0:36:15] DaeStone: @Garrity130 on max settings and 2080 card it does
[0:36:15] ItsNoxid: on a 2080
[0:36:18] Dom_Odyssey: 30fps on a steamdeck
[0:36:20] zerohour_88: its that spec for 4k
[0:36:21] TorvaunDesigns: For a mobile device, it's solid.
[0:36:22] ok_juju: its a steam deck

[0:36:35] Garrity130: ah
[0:36:37] ectoplasma111: if you want 4k 100 fps you basically have to get a 4090/7900xtx

[0:38:10] udev: is based in russia what does one expect. i find the existance of potemkin cities is fantastic.
[0:38:38] AceAssegai: @zerohour_88 oh yea he gives the main plot away
[0:38:40] ectoplasma111: i feel like you should watch ACGs review as a counterpoint :>
[0:38:56] Julia: the art is incredible tbh, maybe just a bit of lack of direction
[0:39:12] ectoplasma111: he basically argues the same thing but with a different conclusion
[0:39:14] yrvengalied: but it looks good
[0:39:14] conv3rge_: That sounds on point for Russia...
[0:39:20] Imbadyoureworse: game has been crazy when I watched people play it

[0:39:58] Havesh: Dark Souls 2 would like to have a word.
[0:39:59] zerohour_88: also SkillUp will like/hate something you might hate/like for the same reason PauseChamp
[0:40:11] Gertew: I hope a 4090 doesnt run like ass
[0:40:12] ectoplasma111: yeah acg also said some spots look very consistent and fantastic some rather bland or consistent

[0:40:49] RhodesToRome: @RoniBranco A reviewer has bias?! Say it ain't so...
[0:40:50] zerohour_88: @RoniBranco that's the point of a review, its his biased opinion
[0:40:55] ectoplasma111: i personally just like seeing cool shit
[0:40:56] bakavic: no such thing as unbiased review
[0:40:57] SMonTwitch: Makes sense
[0:41:00] Julia: thats a direction issue but the art is incredible yes
[0:41:05] JeedanJune: @ihatevnecks its an incredible game, maybe level adp to 25 but DS2 compared is a lot better than a lot of other games out there
[0:41:06] Havesh: @ihatevnecks It was the comparison in terms of haphazard area design.
