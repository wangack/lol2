[1:24:03] irlgigachad: @why_fayiah it suffers from bad pacing where it takes forever progressing to one meaningful event to the next and gets carried away with character establishing and engages in that with now non-existing characters. Series television given an hour +, usually 5-7 series has gotten carried away. Films understand how to convey a lot more faster
