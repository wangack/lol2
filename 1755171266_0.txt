[3:30:10] MellowMelos: @vade255 the lead that Renekton can get on Ornn will be negligible. Even if Renekton is up like 30 CS by 15 minutes, his gold won’t matter as much as Ornn’s at that point so Ornn will just be better. Also Lucian Nami don’t win bot. After the nerfs they don’t win lane super well, they just have good mid-game pick potential
