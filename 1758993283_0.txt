[3:20:38] Censable02: SWORDARR PLEASE MY. TAIWAN BROTHER STOP FREIGING
[3:20:43] irlgigachad: @powdernotjinx in order to be in the LPL you need to have insane mechanics, decisions and consistency is where most falter. Most omg players are semi known and to a degree respected
[3:20:45] kyriakos0801: @tukigamer23 yes
[3:20:54] daniiwry: @Arkaalet nah dont loop him with those lcs noobs, thats a whole another level of low
[3:21:19] Nitesearcher: @kyriakos0801 In LCK, they play in one arena (LoL Park). LPL they have arenas all over China
[3:21:37] NotBraveSphinx: PromisQ would carry those noobs
[3:21:42] kounick: kala pane ta boyna
[3:22:00] duatilu: Don't chek xn*xx omg bettor
[3:22:03] daniiwry: only reason lcs remains a major region is them just buying everyone they can LUL
[3:22:08] kyriakos0801: @nitesearcher okay but they could make 3 hours difference between matches not 2
[3:22:16] tukigamer23: @kyriakos0801 where can i see that map?

[3:23:11] fred7xx: ?
[3:23:22] daniiwry: drx lost ALL their players, and theres no synergy
[3:23:25] kyriakos0801: Typical they will turn the chat to emotes only for no spoils
[3:23:32] 超級綿羊: LPL game so Bedge
[3:23:38] SciSeven77: @daniiwry It is worse that that. It is because it is Top 2 in the money it makes for Riot.
[3:23:40] kyriakos0801: @kounick ti epaixes?
[3:23:50] Nitesearcher: @kyriakos0801 They could do that which would be nice. But in the Chinese broadcasts, they have multiple broadcasts.
[3:23:55] kounick: omg
[3:24:00] daniiwry: im just gonna enjoy chat while i can, once lck is over this chat turns to dumpsterfire
[3:24:09] savas_ulu: 2k gold dif from where
