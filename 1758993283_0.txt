[3:23:38] SciSeven77: @daniiwry It is worse that that. It is because it is Top 2 in the money it makes for Riot.
[3:23:40] kyriakos0801: @kounick ti epaixes?
[3:23:50] Nitesearcher: @kyriakos0801 They could do that which would be nice. But in the Chinese broadcasts, they have multiple broadcasts.
