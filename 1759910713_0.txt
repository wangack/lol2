[0:35:32] KernelPanic_Art: Why chat has been on emote mode last games?
[0:38:19] JMan_Zx: because they are delayed and the games are already in progress or over
[0:38:24] TastyAMG: to prevent people spoiling

[0:43:15] KernelPanic_Art: I still dont understand how the delay works but ok
[0:48:29] Taryngerine: @KernelPanic_Art they just record the game and play it on the stream later
[0:49:22] JMan_Zx: @KernelPanic_Art Some teams have a home stadium, so they don't play in Shanghai but play at the home team's stadium. This means two games happen together
[0:49:47] JMan_Zx: So the english stream has a delay to cast both games, and put a delay on the second game to prevent spoilers
[0:50:04] JMan_Zx: put a emote only mode*

[5:42:09] ye1l: 2 out of 3 of JDG's series losses are because of Ruler throwing/being completely allergic to doing damage

[5:43:31] midoggi: @ye1l ???
[5:43:41] Describable: @ye1l when JDG lose ngl they are bad all around. its not just one
[5:43:56] ye1l: @Describable he completely solothrew the zeri game against WBG by getting caught several times in a row while having a huge lead and vs OMG he didn't play well at all
[5:43:59] Describable: @SkaddyWins buddy naming EU teams
[5:44:00] irlgigachad: a piece of me wants edg to shine, other top teams rely too much on star power. Kenzhu looks pretty legit rn with this roster turn around
[5:44:33] jetlagging1: shadow
[5:44:42] ye1l: like JDG crushed the OMG topside in game 3 but ruler just wasnt there in teamfights

[5:45:02] Describable: @ye1l i think theres mistakes with all JDG, when they have lows - they all have problems in the end. i mean look at EDG, WBG matches
[5:45:05] ye1l: and vs WBG ruler had every tool to carry but jumped over walls to die several times
[5:45:05] mortemfacies: Jd won ?
[5:45:07] 4count: ON PepeHands
[5:45:11] irlgigachad: shocked it took this long to get ON out of there, jfc some of my memories of him on WBG. And bin let him on his team???
[5:45:13] myprecioussosnowy: @aaahahahahahahahahahahaha this
[5:45:28] jetlagging1: EU team signed their first EU player

[5:46:23] Len_xyz: @ye1l I don't think he could have done much better in game 3 when his champ couldn't crit 3 times in a row. after that it's hard for cait to do anything against OMG comp
[5:47:11] ye1l: @Describable WBG game 3 literally the entire team was ahead but Ruler did absolutely nothing but int in teamfights
[5:47:28] Zairon: JDG wonnered?
[5:47:37] delenwen: what was score for jdg vs tt
[5:48:14] Len_xyz: @ye1l @Describable I think so. I feel late game their shotcalling is kinda a mess, probably coz Kanavi has to translate things for Ruler and also do things on map.
