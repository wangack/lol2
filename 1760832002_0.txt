[2:59:14] melvinbluum21: @BLG_Worlds_2023 ye same tbh, but im kinda unsure of omg fpx, omg always find a way to throw and they also play worse against worse teams
[3:00:13] JMan_Zx: That's why both teams were actually trying to lose
[3:00:26] ardzieri: omg
[3:00:26] Waizenblizz: @myprecioussosnowy every missplay is scripted and everyplayer and everysingle team is just maximizing the amount of money they can get right
