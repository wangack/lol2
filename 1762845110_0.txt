[3:31:53] famoustiktoker1: Need a big Leyan game!!
[3:32:02] ye1l: @ye1l they did, but if FPX just picked ziggs+engage support which would've been the more "standard" ap botlane they wouldn't had gotten countered so badly by the morg
[3:32:12] 15dmoogle: gameis

[3:33:24] melvinbluum21: good shit fpx
[3:33:26] ye1l: Basically the veigar is better than the ziggs if RA doesn't spot the morgana counter but if RA spots the morgana counter then Ziggs is a lot safer
[3:33:29] b1ggiesmallz1080: FPX lets go
[3:33:30] r0ycekaboyce: the real match is starting next

[3:35:29] theraiderrr: @vcsnotrigged yeah the chain cc could mean they don't get to move again this game
[3:35:44] ye1l: @ye1l Veigar if not for the black shield brings a disgusting amount of zone control and has infinite scaling, but without lockdown which the blackshield prevents, landing veigar's damage is hard

[3:39:23] ye1l: @ye1l He kills the minions and scales, it's really as simple as that. Provides great zone control with his E at objectives, makes it hard for people to engage/follow up on engage. Can singlehandedly split up teamfights. The pick becomes worse because the black shield stops some of it. Ziggs would've been the more "standard" pick
