[4:14:14] rohocs: hi, iam not LOL bettor. But why LNG is in heavy favor in map2 and even matchodds when they're one map behind already??
[4:14:21] xXVoidXx: because LNG's scoreline indicates they're a much better team, so people believe in them despite the 1 map deficit

[4:16:19] t1fightingxd: wtf LNG lost to AL game 1?
[4:16:22] DkAgent: @xxvoidxx but we know Riot Games is known to put long Slow Mode times for the LEC why though? Because they're a lot of KEKW 's?
[4:16:34] odmjuka: brazil is worst league even worse than lcs

[4:16:49] skaddyworlds: ppx
[4:16:58] xXVoidXx: @DkAgent because there are more viewers and chat spamming I'm guessing?
[4:16:59] rohocs: @rohocs So you mean likely LNG will win the series with one map behind?
[4:17:15] nicothestallion: @rohocs yes

[4:21:56] 91Mika91: @thornsofroses1 there are no drops or stuff like that
[4:22:02] mrqzzn: @WhitestAsian 322

[4:22:32] mrqzzn: stop excusing them
[4:22:56] yucinco: What's 322
[4:23:00] rohocs: @nicothestallion Why AL so underdoge team and LNG in heavy favour? Arent they both Tier 1? or is AL tier 2 team?
[4:23:05] xXVoidXx: @tigerslash123 china has stadiums in different cities, when that happens one series will start before another (in today's case TES vs TT) finishes, but there's only one english cast so it's delayed
