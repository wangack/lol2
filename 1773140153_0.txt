[5:42:52] Len_xyz: @davesterl0l They knew Kass would flank. mao threw his seed in red bush while walking to it. The only angle left to clear would be the bush Kass was in. if he wasn't there, then TES would've assumed Kass isn't flanking and go back. I think vision from minions might have helped too but not sure.
