[2:02:12] rdem0nn: 1-1 100%

[2:03:25] 8saiahh: how many kills did LP have
[2:03:34] primeblue123: how the hell is T1 profitable? I mean Korean fanbase is 1/10 that of NA or EU. 1/20 of China. Given their population. There is absolutely no way to pay the same amount where LPL or LCS
[2:03:46] LuxuryLetdownTV: Because eSports fans aren't like real sports fans in the way that they don't buy tickets or merch, want everything for free
[2:03:46] fab_ceb: Same picks Lmao
