[4:59:40] megitsune18: first blood= map won classic lpl
[4:59:40] eisenhuth1701: lck fans were saying t1 was untuchable xdd they almost got clapped by kt if they could convert a 4k gold lead at 10
[4:59:49] bluesclues96: @LeGOGG T1 got baron after a KT throw, and proceeded to throw that
[4:59:50] NJLsensei: Yeah that game shouldn't be even close but KT threw hard and cuzz was throwing like every fight possible

[6:07:08] volkmarus: Trist has rarely been seen in the pro scene and mostly only being viable in the mid lane as a fringe counter pick. The huge priority is more of a resposne to the meta that Trist goes well into alot of the meta mid champs
