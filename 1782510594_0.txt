[3:48:49] Severikeveri: @DevinBookerTruther yeah probably but i feel like theyre just gonna draft him on a tank again
[3:48:50] TheOreoCupcake: @novafedayn Leave is insane for someone who this is their first split in the LPL, what are you saying xdd
[3:48:54] andywiinters: "my subordinate" damn he looks down on him
[3:48:58] ztoph: If doublelift wasnt in na with na teammates hed be the best adc in the world
[3:48:59] SteelSergeant: 369 is better then Zeus
[3:49:05] quacheck: plink
[3:49:15] rookiierooks: @novafedayn yes but i mean its easier when your support is Meiko or Keria
[3:49:24] splintso: yeah Leave is doing great
[3:49:26] novafedayn: Keri is definitely best player in T1
[3:49:40] andywiinters: @novafedayn ?
[3:49:45] splintso: 1000%
[3:49:54] Skatehabitat24: KT winning lck this year
[3:49:59] splintso: keria is crazy good
[3:49:59] TheOreoCupcake: @novafedayn Supports tend to carry the laning phase. It's hard to look like a good adc if your support is garbage KEKW
[3:50:02] andywiinters: Oh, if you believe so then he is
[3:50:10] yaehcs: Score?
[3:50:16] huntspointbronx420: LPL KEKW
[3:50:35] SteelSergeant: @skatehabitat24 not even close , T1 will 3-1
[3:50:38] splintso: tes 2-1
[3:50:45] Skatehabitat24: ban rumble
[3:50:50] novafedayn: @andyxfrost you said keria not even best player in his team man think you're crazy
[3:50:51] theaaronaces: 2-1 top
[3:50:58] 林家謙: TES will take this game
[3:50:58] theaaronaces: About to be 3-1
[3:51:05] rookiierooks: @novafedayn im not saying Guma or Leave are bad guys , just that Keria and Meiko are too good and its hard too see the real lvl of their adc look at Viper now he is stuck with fkin Life and look the result
[3:51:11] huntspointbronx420: Stare
[3:51:25] ashino69: XXL performance from Jackey
[3:51:25] Severikeveri: TES just gonna close this out 3-1
[3:51:42] 鍊銅術士_不約兒童: BLANKIES BLANKIES
[3:51:49] TheOreoCupcake: @novafedayn True. Meiko and Keria are insane and it's easy to look good as an ADC when playing with them. Deft looked insane with Meiko, the same way how Guma looks really good with Keria.
[3:51:51] ye1l: Photic>guma/leave EZ
[3:51:52] noirlovesyou: 2-2 Prayge
[3:51:54] DevinBookerTruther: Guma gets carried by Keria . If guma played with a bad support like iwandy he would be inting every game
[3:51:56] splintso: i think KT was only close cuz T1 were more focussed on GenG didnt really cover the KT series
[3:52:07] huntspointbronx420: BASED
[3:52:08] kamuivvv: SeemsGood OMG
[3:52:10] Severikeveri: shanji rumble gone sadge
[3:52:15] kamuivvv: OMG 3-2
[3:52:16] Severikeveri: dont put him on a tank tho
