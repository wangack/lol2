[2:38:02] GrimHawkGaming: Is the revenge petty if you've been locked up for 15 years unfairly...?
[2:38:10] zombo_com: its probably a free game

[2:38:36] Jukettaja: The devs said they didn't have the means or experience to do it justice.
[2:38:37] GrimHawkGaming: Time For JP Voice Acting :D
[2:38:39] Jukettaja: So they left it out.
[2:38:43] thaprinnydood: LoL is a small indie company, cant pay the devs for that LUL

[2:39:54] jatii: What was unchained mode?
[2:40:07] Hazelshock: Making stream hard to watch
[2:40:24] Hangfish: Music is pog as always
[2:40:32] ectoplasma111: in unchained mode you play as django
[2:40:36] Jukettaja: Maybe you'll get used to it
[2:40:39] zerohour_88: juttery
[2:40:44] Ravnim: yea, camera is very ðŸ¤®
[2:40:50] DevilsShad0w: is there a setting that diminishes it maybe? @itmeJP
[2:40:55] Jukettaja: There was not
[2:41:07] ectoplasma111: thats what you get without proper user tests :>
[2:41:17] DevilsShad0w: really? damn
[2:41:18] iilu: Just shout really loudly and get all the mobs to come to you so you dont have to move
[2:41:30] slinkyjim: i will break you

[2:42:44] tylawd: So...he was a kid, then locked up for 15 years in chains/immobilized, how is he jacked and a god tier fighter?
[2:42:50] Jukettaja: Potentially
[2:42:58] TDotTerror: After the Lux comic series.
[2:42:58] CaptainFalkyn: they let him work out in mage prison
[2:42:59] Punketsu: oh no

[2:45:39] ectoplasma111: its me
[2:45:42] ectoplasma111: ecto
[2:45:50] Jukettaja: I think he's the one who trained us when we were a mageseeker in the intro cutscene
[2:46:12] ectoplasma111: okay i joined too late
[2:46:19] ectoplasma111: anyone can tell me why we have chain hands
[2:46:49] NoorElBahrain: LoL has a lot of interesting characters. The MMO is going to have an engaging world
[2:46:58] Jukettaja: lol
[2:47:19] ElSpartin: around the base of them it hink
[2:47:20] AnorienNightwish: JP pretty much just started the game, ecto, maybe 10-15 mins in?
[2:47:20] zerohour_88: the circle thing?
[2:47:22] Jukettaja: The circle around the enemy?
[2:47:22] Tronix_604: Riots smart, introducing potentially new champions in LoL, in their offshoot games to get people excited before their releases
[2:47:27] HeartlessM: loading bar on enemy
[2:47:34] ectoplasma111: @AnorienNightwish i was expecting they explained it in the intro sequence
[2:47:43] ectoplasma111: i know were in the tut
[2:48:17] ectoplasma111: i also last played league when there were 35 champions :D
[2:48:21] AnorienNightwish: i missed some of the intro, so not sure if it was explained there
[2:48:57] ectoplasma111: its all good
[2:49:02] Heisuisui: they want you to play claw grip
[2:49:28] Jormunduur: Big Children of Morta vibes
[2:49:33] PenguinInSpace: PenguinInSpace subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 58 months! 
[2:49:56] definitelybean: definitelybean subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:50:03] definitelybean: ITS ME HI
[2:50:04] Jukettaja: I like the fact that you play against the elements
[2:50:07] BigCizzle: i'm liking the music vibes
[2:50:10] Jukettaja: Gives you something to think about
[2:50:11] Punketsu: it took me a bit but yeah once it clicks it feels reeeally solid
[2:50:19] definitelybean: are you playing w/ controller
[2:50:36] Jukettaja: I don't see why not
[2:50:37] definitelybean: no definitely play with controller
[2:50:41] definitelybean: way easier with controller
[2:50:45] definitelybean: devs suggest it
[2:51:08] WDForty: lots of aiming, i would use mouse and kb, that's how i played bastion
[2:51:42] moist_heinous: Ma-Geese-Ker
[2:52:58] definitelybean: players/devs say combat is smoother with controller but some people prefer keyboardmouse
[2:53:04] thaprinnydood: idk most isometric action games seem perfect for controller, like hades
[2:53:24] zerohour_88: WAYTOODANK
[2:53:25] Jukettaja: lol
[2:53:46] WDForty: i prefer mouse and kb for these types of games personally
[2:54:30] NoorElBahrain: ijpKEK
[2:54:52] bobislost: not knowing how to fight sounds like every team member i've ever had
[2:55:36] Jukettaja: "I love carrots"
[2:55:56] gotthejuicegg: @bobislost true
[2:56:37] luchox2: morgana is
[2:56:40] TDotTerror: Morgana.
[2:56:41] Jukettaja: I wish I knew
[2:56:45] ChaosMole: my Guess Morg
[2:57:13] Jukettaja: I didn't know people worshiped Morgana
[2:57:21] Punketsu: yea despite the visual look, Morgana is the good sister. Kayle is fucked up
[2:57:21] ChaosMole: I do not know but it looks a bit like Morg when you get close to the Statue
[2:57:56] Jukettaja: Yeah Kayle is very ruthless
[2:58:06] Reductive_Reasoning: Good is subjective
[2:58:07] ElSpartin: Kayle is hyper Authoritarian and mericiless
[2:58:26] Rennalt: dad jokes are universal
[2:58:33] Neragsito: If you hear Kayle's dialogues in League she's a super fascist
[2:58:37] Jukettaja: I kind of miss playing Kayle.
[2:58:39] Punketsu: yea Morgana is like a "patron saint" for the underclass and those wronged by those in power. Kayle represents absolute justice, with no gray area
[2:58:47] luchox2: @Punketsu Kayle is an extremist she is not bad, but she is kinda crazy
[2:58:54] SMonTwitch: hypeE
[2:58:54] ChaosMole: He already knows
[2:59:03] ChaosMole: he did a tweet :)
[2:59:16] Punketsu: i think he did once
[2:59:21] Punketsu: i forget for what tho
[2:59:31] crawds: necrit on youtube made good lol lore videos
[3:00:23] Jukettaja: Is that a cat?
[3:00:25] Darkaros: You saying a horror made this chata?
[3:00:56] WhiskeySweet:  Ads are about to play! JP's Twitch contract has ended, and as a member of the ads incentive program he no longer has precise control over when ads run. Ads will run 180 seconds automatically every hour. As always, subscribing to the channel prevents ads. Thanks! ijpLOVE
[3:01:50] Jukettaja: We're jungling
[3:01:52] CaptainFalkyn: 15
[3:01:55] Deathspate: About 15 hours I think
[3:02:29] Punketsu: ...i opened my prime capsule and got sylas
[3:02:38] Punketsu: riot is watching stripSweat
[3:03:07] NoorElBahrain: Punketsu ijpHI
[3:03:28] Punketsu: noor stripHi
[3:03:43] crawds: probably got atleast 10-20skins for free just from prime capsule over the years
[3:04:00] Senpai_Eeyore: I like the music
[3:04:01] Punketsu: yeah I've gotten a lot of good shit from those capsules
[3:04:05] Nemm__: Very moonlighter
[3:04:08] Punketsu: got that dualit volibear skin thats p[oggers
[3:04:16] LadyDharma: just thinking that, but its easier on the eyes
[3:04:18] Jukettaja: Reminds me of Children of Morta
[3:04:22] Punketsu: TAKE BLUE BUFF Pog
[3:04:24] zombo_com: as soon as I saw this game, my first thought was, Ohh so Riot is copying hades
[3:04:31] Alaquane: I was thinking hyper light drifter?
[3:04:32] Senpai_Eeyore: yeah its like a more pixalated hades in some ways
[3:04:36] vordican: boss fights feel very close to children of morta
[3:04:43] Senpai_Eeyore: pixelated
[3:04:56] Punketsu: the sound effects are really satisfying
[3:05:18] Alaquane: @Nemm__ digital sun, the dev, made moonlighter. so that fits
[3:05:29] Jukettaja: Loot
[3:05:36] PelleBulldog: I love how Riot went "What we gonna do with all that League money?" "How 'bout one game in every genre!" "ok lets do it!"
[3:05:39] Archangel3003: I just realized that this was announced after the Willump and Nunu game and came out before it Aware
[3:05:50] crawds: would have been perfect if it was voiced by sylar va
[3:05:58] Punketsu: yeah wtf happened to that nunu game
[3:06:05] Nemm__: Oh please, those were lane minions
[3:06:05] PartyOnBarth: This the same dev as Children of Moria?
[3:06:05] LadyDharma: slightly like Nobody saves the world too
[3:06:10] CaptainFalkyn: it's coming out this year, isn't it?
[3:06:14] Nemm__: Nunu is coming out later this year
[3:06:17] crawds: @PartyOnBarth moonlighter dev
[3:06:19] vaelindreth: forgot they were making that
[3:06:20] Miros__: nunu these balls?
[3:06:20] Deathspate: @Punketsu For later this year, they all have release dates, there's a trailer
[3:06:25] ixixonja: they announced the Nunu game before this one
[3:06:26] Punketsu: ahh
[3:06:33] Jukettaja: @PartyOnBarth I don't think so.
[3:06:40] Alaquane: Song of Nunu
[3:06:41] Punketsu: i was gonna say that game was announced when Ruined King came out
[3:06:54] PartyOnBarth: Interesting, thanks @crawds
[3:07:15] Archangel3003: Willump and Nunu got announced back with Ruined King and the Ziggs game but then got delayed.
[3:07:30] PathunV: Ekko's game is the next one right?
[3:07:30] Punketsu: man Ruined King was such a good game
[3:07:31] CaptainFalkyn: sylas with no dash cooldown
[3:07:35] Punketsu: SourPls
[3:07:39] deakpeek: I remember not liking the combat in Moonlighter so im glad it feels good
[3:07:49] crawds: no W heals?
[3:07:57] Alaquane: All these riot games are Riot telling devs, hey you made a good game, clone it , but make it league of legends
[3:08:13] Punketsu: there's worse ways to mkae money
[3:08:41] Jukettaja: Can you remap them?
[3:08:42] CaptainFalkyn: I like good games with league lore
[3:08:45] CaptainFalkyn: winning combo imo
[3:09:00] Alaquane: Nunu game will  be Rime
[3:09:03] AinzN: ijpHMM
[3:09:06] crawds: everything riot games made so far is basically like blizzard. Make a similar popular game and give it own spin
[3:09:07] Deathspate: @Alaquane I mean, this games isn't like Moonlighter, but yeah, it's basically riot going to devs and telling them "you know how to do this genre, so do it"
[3:09:09] MichaelZarick: enjoying the game so far? waffling on buying it
[3:09:46] AinzN: Seems like a fun game
[3:10:24] ixixonja: Pog silverwing

[3:10:31] AinzN: ijpCUTE
[3:10:43] Punketsu: i assume so lol
[3:10:47] Punketsu: havent actually played it
[3:11:03] SouthernBiscuits: there is a silverwing little legend
[3:11:13] ixixonja: silverwings are part of demacia , they use them as mounts
[3:11:14] Punketsu: I should, i've gotten a bunch of stuff for it through normal League
[3:12:47] markbart1: it looks fun and satisfying
[3:12:55] Jukettaja: Yeah it should be fun with more and more
[3:13:00] Punketsu: yea I can only imagine what the last hour or two of the game will look like
[3:13:13] MichaelZarick: game reminds me a lot of that pixel art mage roguelike
[3:13:35] Ebra: yea
[3:13:35] Alaquane: hyperlight drifter?
[3:13:38] gIowsticks: @MichaelZarick same devs

[3:22:25] Deathspate: Only voice acting for the game LUL
[3:22:29] Jukettaja: Nu-uh annePoint
[3:22:42] Jukettaja: @Deathspate TRUE
[3:23:13] Jukettaja: Is it extra mana all the time or only when using frost?
[3:24:11] thesestrangenotions: How is the gameplay?
[3:24:42] BigCizzle: ratJAM musics great
[3:25:04] Jukettaja: We're putting together a team
[3:25:12] Jukettaja: One last job
[3:25:13] thesestrangenotions: I saw a tweet saying it felt like Hades in the combat, if that holds up I might not even wait for a sale
[3:25:19] Nashfanfl13: vinyl hipster alert
[3:25:24] PlayWithMonsters: Between this, Arcane and Ruined king, lol is the only thing im not into when it comes to lol
[3:25:25] Lauw: !JPeek
[3:25:26] itmeBOT: JPeek is a stream segment where JP checks out a new game or a game he hasn't played before.
[3:25:26] Deathspate: Garen at home LUL
[3:25:33] Jukettaja: lol
[3:25:57] GreatThane: why are side missions so shocking?
[3:26:04] Jukettaja: It's a tiny indie title
[3:26:44] Jukettaja: Music suddenly kicks in
[3:26:46] Deathspate: I assume it's shocking because it's still an indie title at the end of the day. I thought it would just be one linear story and that's it as well
[3:26:58] CaptainFalkyn: can't wait for more LoL champions to appear
[3:27:00] Zaelsus: catJAM PianoTime
[3:27:11] friegolit: Never trust dudes with pauldrons bigger than their heads

[3:28:27] Deathspate: That man sounds like he can be a grand wizard
[3:28:38] CaptainFalkyn: bonfire lit
[3:28:41] Jukettaja: A bonfirew
[3:28:43] Zaelsus: I'm just waiting for that organ to have a resurgence in some form of a boss fight, definitely gonna be epic
[3:28:52] Morgaln: It seems like Riot is not missing with all the games they're publishing
[3:28:55] Jukettaja: League of Souls
[3:29:08] Punketsu: it was fairly solid
[3:29:09] thesestrangenotions: Organ could be auto played, I've seen churches do that because they had to share members who played
[3:29:12] DragonFlamely: Yes, it's very fun
[3:29:14] spideycsa: Yup ziggs game is fun
[3:29:15] GreatThane: is the NuNu game out yet?

[3:29:50] Deno5555: Sylas is a terrorist though
[3:29:51] Jukettaja: You've been propaganded
[3:29:52] zerohour_88: is he a good guy tho
[3:29:53] Neragsito: sylas is a bad guy
[3:29:57] W_Tile: to be fair they portrait him like that
[3:29:58] FraccIes: anti-hero?
[3:29:58] Deathspate: What would be nuts is if the devs made a rogue-lite DLC, could be nuts with the gameplay
[3:30:01] GrimHawkGaming: I mean, he kind of wants to kill civis so
[3:30:01] Punketsu: garen player

[3:30:48] Meis122: We all know the real hero is OSFrog Thomas Kench
[3:30:50] xarantur: Sylas is a good guy wants to Burn demacia to the GROUND stripBurn
[3:31:05] Punketsu: yeah it takes a second
[3:31:23] Deathspate: Sylas is just against racism...even if it means killing them
[3:31:28] Onyxghost: god of war combat SeemsGood
[3:31:38] thesestrangenotions: I'm still stuck on the camera, maybe the art direction. But I like the combat and music
[3:31:47] Deno5555: I feel like Morgana is a better rep. than Sylas for mage users in Demacia
[3:32:00] Deno5555: *magic users
[3:32:00] Deathspate: Maybe you go up?
[3:32:15] GrimHawkGaming: Hey JP, you missed a chest.

[3:34:12] xarantur: X , x , x Y
[3:34:14] DobbsjustDobbs: X X X Y @itmeJP
[3:34:26] gIowsticks: i mean demacia is basically magic racist and is oppressively violent about it, how would you be a bad guy for fighting against that
[3:34:42] Deathspate: This game has tons of great lore, it's nice to see Riot actually making progress on lore after a damn decade
[3:34:45] Jukettaja: Ooh
[3:34:57] Punketsu: ok yeah the game kinda fucks
[3:34:58] Jukettaja: Okay the fact that this game even has combos is pretty neat

[3:38:07] Jukettaja: Earth element?
[3:38:18] gotthejuicegg: watching JP play Ruined King was also super fun

[3:51:56] TeaJaySketch: whens he comin to league
[3:52:05] Deathspate: Alright, that's it, who fed the kid?
[3:52:05] TheRedTyrrant: It's Ryze? I don't know anything about LoL lore.
[3:52:06] jaykodiak: fairly surprised this isnt voice acted

[3:52:09] W_Tile: LUL
[3:52:13] CaptainFalkyn: not roguelike though

[3:52:43] NyxUnchained: i heard theres yordles Kreygasm
[3:52:47] TeaJaySketch: I am also surprised its not voice acted
[3:52:52] NyxUnchained: ^
[3:52:53] Lindobu: rukko nuked a room and he isn't a champ in league stripWtf
[3:53:09] AinzN: Chat is this combat classed as Hack n' Slash?
[3:53:10] Jukettaja: Needs the Disco Elysium treatment
[3:53:13] espi: Matt Mercer wasn't available
[3:53:16] espi: so they don't have voice acting
[3:53:16] CorporalPibb: couldn't they ask Riot for VA's?
[3:53:26] thesestrangenotions: @ainzn IMO yes
[3:53:41] TeaJaySketch: critical role team was unavailable Sadge
[3:53:45] Jukettaja: Voice actors yes but they weren't confident organizing it
[3:53:50] chazlupine: Oh damn this season of league is looking different.
[3:54:00] Jukettaja: I assume the team is quite small
[3:54:02] thesestrangenotions: Kind of like how Darksiders was hack and slash base with power ups, combos, and specials
[3:54:08] DragonFlamely: that's a lot of reading
[3:54:10] NyxUnchained: im ngl this looks like the kind of conversation im just gonna skip through
[3:54:12] Runner027: I'll summerise... they said stuff I said stuff the story continues
[3:54:12] Deathspate: @CorporalPibb We don't know the level of corporation that happens for these games. We know Riot provides marketting, narrative, music and some other stuff. Not sure if no VA is a creative choice or not
[3:54:12] NyxUnchained: too much reading
[3:54:39] AinzN: It's good if you are into the League Lore
[3:54:41] NyxUnchained: i mean they provided nunu voice acting for that game right ?
[3:54:44] Alaquane: her grandma was a fire mage
[3:54:54] RVIII: how is this game going? had to dip for a couple hours
[3:54:54] Deathspate: @NyxUnchained I think so? It seems like that from trailer
[3:54:57] jaykodiak: Garen gonna hunt you down man
[3:55:09] Deathspate: They also did VA for Ruined King iirc
[3:55:14] Deathspate: And the rhythm game
[3:55:23] DragonFlamely: careful of the bushes.  Garen can be anywhere
[3:56:00] thesestrangenotions: @rviii  great enough JP is tempted* for a full on stream run
[3:56:04] Deathspate: The cool part is how the leadup to this game was an entire comic series focused on Katarina
[3:56:12] Deathspate: And how her actions resulted in this game
[3:56:15] TheLightWraith: ooh we scalin'
[3:56:42] TDotTerror: We scalin'.
[3:56:58] NyxUnchained: too much reading for me 4Head
[3:57:03] NyxUnchained: i think i will skip
[3:57:24] OP_Island: OP_Island subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[3:57:38] Deathspate: I assume parts of the camp need to be repaired over time
[3:57:52] thesestrangenotions: *hears chest get mentioned* ijpONO
[4:01:02] WhiskeySweet:  Ads are about to play! JP's Twitch contract has ended, and as a member of the ads incentive program he no longer has precise control over when ads run. Ads will run 180 seconds automatically every hour. As always, subscribing to the channel prevents ads. Thanks! ijpLOVE

[4:04:28] Zhanrax72: yea
[4:04:31] Alaquane: lots of illaoi
[4:04:39] thesestrangenotions: This is the  good shit that validates my Steam Deck purchase.
[4:04:44] unlackie32: there were a lot of jinx after arcane
[4:05:01] Punketsu: arcane had so much jinx, Vi, and Jayce
[4:05:08] Punketsu: ironically I still didnt see a lot of Viktor
[4:05:12] Alaquane: and there's a mission for the launch of this game. play a game with a sylas in it, unlock icons
[4:05:21] MichaelZarick: music is bangin'
[4:05:52] NoorElBahrain: the combat is exciting but the music has a sad theme to it ijpSAD
[4:05:56] Punketsu: riot's up there with Supergiant in terms of "i know the OST is gonna be all bangers"
[4:06:02] crawds: ithink jinx has the highest pick/ban rate
[4:06:11] cleansock42: you see the katarina comic that is a prequal to this game?
[4:06:46] MaxedShadow: is this Hades?
[4:07:06] Onyxghost: hirby
[4:07:13] roy_o_: without the roguelike
[4:07:37] zombo_com: Hirby lol
[4:08:21] JimB0b0: Feels like a zelda game, honestly
[4:08:36] Onyxghost: zelda wishes it had this much action

[4:09:25] Punketsu: ...i didnt wanna say it but I was wondering
[4:09:56] AnorienNightwish: !backseat
[4:09:56] itmeBOT: JP might not read or respond to everything, but he is happy to get non-spoilery, respectful advice on games. Keep in mind, any backseating that is linked to the story of the game ( do X to get Y outcome) is prohibited. ijpLOVE
[4:10:12] omgitsjason: PauseChamp
[4:10:51] thesestrangenotions: Can you stack pots or is there just one type to have handy?
[4:11:09] KarelTheAnchor: this music makes me think of witcher 3
[4:11:25] Alaquane: l bet it feels better when you get more spell slots
[4:11:52] thesestrangenotions: I'm guessing they have some variety in mechanics per mission. Kind of like level types in Crash or something
[4:16:11] thesestrangenotions: Chat, in regards to the lore/story in this and ruined king, how much is pre-established and how much is new?
[4:16:52] Punketsu: most of this is established, its mostly just expanding on what was there
[4:16:59] Shenseiken: pet the dog? VoteYea
[4:17:01] Gertew: Small indie company cant even include auto save FailFish
[4:17:36] thesestrangenotions: @punketsu so mostly more details/fleshing out? Or just seeing something as opposed to pure text?
[4:17:36] Punketsu: Sadge
[4:17:47] Billy_Bo_Baggins: this reminds me alot of Wizard of Legend
[4:17:53] thesestrangenotions: Fingers crossed for a full run.
[4:18:09] Punketsu: @thesestrangenotions both really. Most of what's written is just like 'and then syslas broke out, the end"
[4:18:31] thesestrangenotions: Ah ok. Neat thanks @punketsu
[4:18:37] bairdman: @Billy_Bo_Baggins das a good roguelike right there, tell you hwat
[4:18:48] zerohour_88: this kinda makes we wonder about the ARPG's story too, like we saw Garen iirc
[4:18:53] AnorienNightwish: chest tho NODDERS
[4:19:09] zerohour_88: or spells
[4:19:34] Onyxghost: theres some cool surprises :)
[4:19:39] crawds: you basically killing caster and melee minions
[4:19:52] Deathspate: This just makes me want Riot's ARPG even more
[4:21:36] omgitsjason: yeah idk how i feel about the art style. its okay i guess
[4:21:56] zerohour_88: eat the rich NODDERS
[4:21:58] Deathspate: Yeah, they're racist in all the ways
[4:22:12] thesestrangenotions: Art style grew on me. Still a little tough tone sure of what's what,but I'm getting used to it
[4:22:28] thesestrangenotions: Tough to be*
[4:23:26] Onyxghost: i think the art is fantastic, works well for the game
[4:23:51] DanVelly: Hmm just HOW get normal people around this town if all the places are only reached by chain pull?
[4:23:59] TDotTerror: Ah, Fiddlesticks.
[4:24:06] W_Tile: that's fiddle
[4:24:06] titanodin: swain?
[4:24:09] Merandil: Fiiiiddle..stiiiiiicks
[4:24:09] Deathspate: Oh yeah, fiddle
[4:24:10] Onyxghost: Fiddlesticks :D
[4:24:13] ChaosMole: Sounds like Fiddle
[4:24:31] titanodin: ya isnt fiddle a god?
[4:24:34] Deathspate: He's the emobidment of fear
[4:24:34] omgitsjason: something like that
[4:24:37] ChaosMole: mhhh
[4:24:38] TDotTerror: Fiddle's a demon of fear.
[4:24:41] Merandil: Oh not quite. He is so very much not stuck, that's the issue
[4:24:43] omgitsjason: no nocturn is fear incarnate
[4:24:43] ChaosMole: good question
[4:24:44] thaprinnydood: hes like 1 of the 6 demons or something
[4:24:44] Zaelsus: Yeah, the primordial fear made manifest
[4:24:46] Onyxghost: he hangs out in one of the forests in demacia
[4:24:56] omgitsjason: fiddle is a god/demon
[4:25:12] titanodin: dis dude is already playing the mmo LUL
[4:25:17] zombo_com: One such story is that Fiddlesticks was accidentally released by a mage tampering with powers beyond their understanding. A story from Noxus depicts Fiddlesticks as an innocent farmboy who was blamed for a bad harvest and fed to the crows that came back as a demon. Despite no shortage of stories and theories, no one truly knows where Fiddlesticks came from.
[4:27:12] Deathspate: @thaprinnydood There are 11 iirc, there's a "family tree" that was released with his rework
[4:27:23] Deathspate: 11 major ones, tons of minor ones
[4:27:30] winteckxlr: !JPeek
[4:27:30] itmeBOT: JPeek is a stream segment where JP checks out a new game or a game he hasn't played before.
[4:27:31] Zaelsus: Where a lot of the demons are an aspect of some attribute, in this case fear, Fiddlesticks would be considered as the root of fear, where Nocturne is more the nightmare side of fear
[4:27:33] colquitt_17: colquitt_17 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 115 months, currently on a 115 month streak! 
[4:27:55] thaprinnydood: @thaprinnydood yeah I wasnt sure on the specifics,  just remember the demon stuff in LoL

[4:28:41] Deathspate: @Zaelsus Yup. Some of his stories have him coming as the lost loved one of a person, haunting them as he encroaches
[4:28:56] Deathspate: His theme is still so freaking good for portraying that
[4:29:07] friegolit: Murderize the fash!
[4:29:08] ChaosMole: I really liked the game thus far, it's nice for a small Game
[4:29:11] zerohour_88: JP just punching people with chains at a library
[4:29:29] Onyxghost: they have really stepped up the lore over the past 10 years for characters
[4:29:36] DragonFlamely: voice acting is so important in games nowdays
