[0:34:46] Yolo_pete: T1 lost to #13 LPL KEKW
[0:34:54] literalmountgod: how does lng have 2 games but everyone else 1
[0:35:01] jhona88: omg iluminatti piramid
[0:35:01] Moobot: All info of the LPL 2023 Summer Schedule can be found here: https://lolesports.com/schedule?leagues=lpl
[0:35:11] UwU_TkaR: lpl is way better than lck because its more competitive
[0:35:45] literalmountgod: TSM isnt winning anything if they go to lpl KEKW
[0:36:05] BlueBlasting: @UwU_TkaR No way LCK is as competitive as a region w one of the biggest populations on earth
[0:36:14] Yolo_pete: TSM vs TESM - the battle of ages Pog
[0:36:19] UwU_TkaR: all teams here are great but in lck only a few teams are good
[0:36:33] omgfans_: May I ask why the LCS hasn't started yet? Is it disbanded?
[0:36:33] tryhard_virus: june 4
[0:36:41] captainkrajick: @omgfans_ Clueless
[0:37:00] BlueBlasting: LCS is posponed by 2 weeks
[0:37:04] captainkrajick: @omgfans_ It's been delayed for 2 weeks. Starts 17th, else it's canceled and no LCS for Worlds
[0:37:14] UwU_TkaR: lcs is joke
[0:37:33] literalmountgod: im from america and I dont watch lcs at all its really bad
[0:37:37] kphhh: Which player will play tank today
[0:37:49] UwU_TkaR: its a waste that corejj went to lcs
[0:37:50] jeffthefff: @omgfans_ the players association and riot have been trying to negotiate regarding getting rid of the challengers/academy league, and as a threat riot is delaying summer split by 2 weeks and maybe cancelling it altogether
[0:38:48] BlueBlasting: How well do you guys think TSM will do? I think they will at least be competitive since they have money to get strong people and are recognized internationally as a meme
[0:38:48] irlgigachad: mole back in lpl. neeko meta? this has to be a ban right?
[0:38:55] Yolo_pete: When is Asian Games btw?
[0:39:10] SAVEFACE3: only 18 more years Pog
[0:39:16] b4cc4lord: @omgfans_ wait who wants to get rid of LCS Academy and LCS Challengers? that's the only good part of NA League
[0:39:35] omgfans_: If the LCS is disbanded, it will be difficult to allocate places for the World Championship
[0:39:46] scpablitroque: Champi14, here i am waiting for u my bro...
[0:40:06] aphexxxtwink: give OCE a spot again ;)
[0:40:32] b4cc4lord: @ssYoungx god I wish
[0:40:40] BlueBlasting: Oh yeah, billionaires. TSM might have a long fight
[0:40:45] flat717: Why does LPL have more teams than other regions? KEKW
[0:40:47] Waibop: COPIUM unsilence OCE
[0:40:52] irlgigachad: @BlueBlasting flandre sofm dream, find a kr bot duo and go from there. Would be fun if ppgod samd were reunited there

[0:41:31] b4cc4lord: @literalmountgod taiwan doesn't play with west taiwan, regular taiwan is with PCS
[0:41:32] aphexxxtwink: wbg?
[0:41:38] Yolo_pete: @ssYoungx yup
[0:41:41] b4cc4lord: yep
[0:41:46] le_voff: yes
[0:41:56] jeffthefff: @omgfans_ basically riot removed the need for teams to have an academy team
[0:41:59] aphexxxtwink: its a theshy gap ig
[0:42:11] omgfans_: It’s not about money, other regions can also get a lot of teams, but they don’t have so many people
[0:42:22] jeffthefff: and like most teams dont really care about it anyways because it costs them money that theyre not making back
[0:42:28] Yolo_pete: Damn today have banger matches POGGERS
[0:42:51] jeffthefff: but it was a pretty sudden announcement and it just left a lot of players screwed over
[0:43:09] b4cc4lord: in all fairness the best teams in LCS academy and challengers are the non-org teams anyway KEKW
[0:43:09] aphexxxtwink: especially that last match holllyyyy
[0:43:18] BlueBlasting: Tbf wouldnt Acad just die over time if something doesnt change
[0:43:25] b4cc4lord: like the cincinatti fear
[0:43:25] kikikinds: GIGABIN
[0:43:35] AYAYALOUDER: is this taylor swift?

[0:44:55] weijiepeng: LNG 2:0 JDG
[0:44:55] UwU_TkaR: blg done great to korean teams to be honest
[0:44:56] irlgigachad: itd be funny if tsm went na mode in cn and got sofm doinb + 2 imports so it was like na where domestic talent has 1 player
[0:44:56] jeffthefff: academy was already pretty dead i mean no one watches it, theres a reason a bunch of teams immediately dropped their academy teams once they werent required to have one
[0:45:02] SoulSnorlax: noting is impossible
[0:45:06] Yolo_pete: @UwU_TkaR Unlikely but they are dark horse at least
[0:45:13] BlueBlasting: @UwU_TkaR Maybe if they have secret strategies
[0:45:33] kianastra: no, when JDG exist

[0:46:33] literalmountgod: @flat717 KEKW
[0:46:33] irlgigachad: @literalmountgod doubt, but if its an adc meta come worlds prince and flyq probably upset an lpl or lck team

[0:48:12] BlazingHigh: Zeus will carry LCK FeelsGoodMan
[0:48:13] jeffthefff: @literalmountgod idk eastern teams have mastered playing around their adc and having cracked ad carrys
[0:48:16] omgfans_: Before BLG won the world championship, they had to go through JDG first, because JDG won the five previous matches
[0:48:44] UwU_TkaR: @UwU_TkaR i know but he is playing right now
[0:48:54] UwU_TkaR: in lpl
[0:49:06] JustinLaurel: Double agent Kanavi plays the best league of his life FeelsGoodMan Gets selected by Korea for Asia games FeelsGoodMan Starts inting his ass off FeelsGoodMan
