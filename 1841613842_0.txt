Except most LPL fans don’t go to LCK chat to constantly spread hate and trashtalk where as LCK stans do the opposite. So if you’re the rare sane LCK fan then cheer for your region and may the best win come worlds. LPL is definitely #1 for the time being though

[7:29:45] newstyletophx: Why doesn't LPL have as many viewers as LCK
[7:29:55] captainkrajick: @newstyletophx thats because it has more
