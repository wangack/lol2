[6:52:01] MusicalMrJ: Seeing JDG dominate the way they are makes you think we're about to go into a new era like how T1 did in the early LCS days with faker. This is JDGs time

[6:52:18] OHmaigodman: you can't be the best adc ever without a worlds title
[6:52:23] Kaatsuraa: @kingjoshuatargaryen ruler is so much better
[6:52:30] klausterz: Ruler was 15 cs below Thesnake, losing to a rookie? This never happened with UZI
[6:52:40] Derfrk: @MusicalMrJ Na na na T1 will shut them down at worlds again and actually win this time, cope
