[2:43:43] BlackTacular: why do they stream from bedrooms? I feel so disconnected from them atm. I wish they were in an office or at least used a backdrop when casting. I would make all the difference. Seeing that bed makes me feel this is low quality casting even though I know its not.

[2:45:27] kyriakos0801: @blacktacular it's definitely low quality casting but we are here because it's the best league not for the casters

[2:48:13] kyriakos0801: @blacktacular true lpl deserves more than this for sure. It's just because games are played all over China and not only in one studio as LCK and LEC. Maybe that's the reason there is so bad casting. Maybe one day they make real casting
