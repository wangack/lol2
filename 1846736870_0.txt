[1:28:52] bookjun: @EpicSpoon__ maybe next, not this one for sure
[1:28:56] ye1l: there's a reason why LNG was 12th in the league for early game stats in spring, literally everyone but tarzan was losing majority of early games
[1:28:59] trevnenant: hi chat <3

[1:29:25] yucinco: Don't look at adc cs and it's winnable
[1:29:27] Dravianis: winged dragon of ra will win this
[1:29:39] lol_degen_betting: @EpicSpoon__ i think they win game 2 but
[1:29:46] frake_lol: oh but look the stats say hmm ... Nerdge
[1:29:51] lol_degen_betting: @EpicSpoon__ hell no brother thats insane
[1:29:55] JomeurLit: To think there’s people Malding to this as we speak
[1:29:57] bookjun: @ye1l because everyone knew Tarzan had to play for mid, LP cant carry shit
[1:30:02] ye1l: @captainkrajick LNG is objectively bad at the early game, like you'd be insane to argue against it. Literally bottom 5 for early game stats in spring, Gala was never known to be a strong laner so he doesn't really shift that aspect for them
[1:30:04] MadHuskies: reminder that TSM gonna destroy LPL next year when they join TSM TSM TSM
[1:30:04] JomeurLit: It’s a funny thought
