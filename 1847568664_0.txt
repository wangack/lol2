[1:39:42] zcdcd: @click_sg I think LPL is more ornamental, but because LCK is a direct competitor, coupled with certain biases. So LPL has fewer Western audiences than LCK.

[6:30:31] jaor: i feel as if we as a whole, a community, are losing interest in all this talk? perhaps it would be better to lure us in with more proper eyecandy
