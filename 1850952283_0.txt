[1:13:15] RevanTheGray: @DonJuanTheJuan because most of us are ResidentSleeper this time of night LUL
[1:13:20] Mechafanboy: @RevanTheGray Or maybe it's better to say like top 4 teams or so will usually exchange places and games every playoffs. Hard to pick one team over the others imo.
[1:13:22] presidentisraelzavala: How many kills does Mfis have

[1:15:25] Mechafanboy: @RevanTheGray I *think* if there;s favourites, they follow players more than teams but ther's no simple one dominating team every year. RNG was the one for a while due to full Chinese roster and Uzi but that's been false for a while.
[1:15:29] Puraemu: Up map1? But Hery is so trashh
[1:15:29] D_2_X: @Canvaii their whole team played in asian games qualifier

[4:49:14] ye1l: @DkAgent not really, Knight/Kanavi when they actually play well which they've done in finals/MSI are a completely different level of player then Yagao and Xun, especially Knight.
[4:49:27] chupisxxxco: md3?
[4:49:45] ye1l: Like BLG should never beat JDG unless Elk completely 1v9s which he almost did in spring po in the first round
[4:50:11] thepatman99: That seals the deal. I am no longer an IG fan. I’ve been a fan since 2014 and a season ticket holder since 2017. I officially will not be renewing my plan next season nor will I watch on twitch ever again. I’m going to EDG where they know how to run an LPL team.
[4:50:14] DkAgent: @ye1l so you're saying JDG will complete the grand slam this year
[4:50:30] diversity06: @shiny_chocobo who are u gonna bet in Game 2?
[4:50:41] DonEladio: Chatting
[4:50:41] ye1l: @DkAgent I mean yeah if they don't choke they should, if they fail to its cuz they choked basically

[4:53:52] babbols: These kids need proteins man
[4:54:01] diversity06: @censable02 in LPL, they are the bottom 2
[4:54:02] ye1l: like a 5 or something, both teams are very average
[4:54:06] diversity06: so 1
[4:54:09] alexchistruga: ez 2- 0
[4:54:11] SLIP_Fury: this IG rolster is undefeated this split

[4:55:32] ye1l: @diversity06 bottom 2 is their performance but these teams are just not bottom 2 in terms of strength, teams like LGD/UP/AL are definitely worse on paper
[4:55:32] marcomachia: They can't play, they can't draft... why are these people here?
