[0:16:41] Swimhornett: LNG gonna bag this one theyre due
[0:16:47] SoulSnorlax: Damn EDG #11 now
[0:16:54] NidgeOCE: Yeahh
[0:17:01] NidgeOCE: Hope so @swimhornett
[0:17:12] NidgeOCE: They're the toughest bet
[0:17:17] SoulSnorlax: damn TT #14
[0:18:01] ex0tikaimz: Why so many ppl here if it don’t start yet lol LETS GOO
[0:18:04] Swimhornett: @NidgeOCE Are betting sites putting low odds on them (LNG)?
[0:18:14] Beanp0t: JackChicken
[0:18:14] Moobot: The casters of today are Mazel (https://twitter.com/MazelCasts) and Lyric (https://twitter.com/JordanCorbylol), Munchables (https://twitter.com/HeyMunchables) and Nymaera (https://twitter.com/Nymaera)!
[0:18:23] NidgeOCE: Yes actually
[0:19:08] scubastevedrip: this song needs to go to hell fast
[0:19:11] viperismvmmy: yayLeague
[0:19:17] NidgeOCE: Oh
[0:19:22] dawnofisai: KKona lets get some dubs tonight boys
[0:19:51] NidgeOCE: @swimhornett apparently I didn't bet them except the lng vs UP
[0:19:52] bluekcs2: KKona
[0:20:05] Swimhornett: That's weird. They are the worse team imo but they have a high peak and they won in reg season in spring. i feel like its not that bad of a bet
[0:20:21] sammuxx: Edg 2-0 wbg 2-0 blg 2-0
[0:20:22] scubastevedrip: i was feeling good today and this song has eclipsed me with the urge to do the commit
[0:20:56] NidgeOCE: Most of my bets are 14 multies that are easy to predict, I mixed with lpl, lck and lcs matches of the easiest ones, depo 30aud and getting back 1k possibly
[0:21:11] sammuxx: Edg 2-1*
[0:21:23] NidgeOCE: Blg vs lng was risky
[0:21:31] boulognesan: They can give surprise
[0:21:32] iloveuuu123: AL 2-0, 17 odds
[0:21:49] iloveuuu123: AL 2-0 please
[0:22:19] babbols: BatChest BatChest BatChest PotFriend PotFriend PotFriend
[0:22:19] sammuxx: Edg have been pretty trash this split but doubt al win
[0:22:27] Swimhornett: Yeah def risky. Thats cool. Have you been winning so far? I sports bet on occasion but I'm pretty mediocre lol
[0:24:39] Dextroslol: WEIBO GAMING
[0:25:05] Swimhornett: WEIBO GAMING
[0:25:06] Raja888: Lng will lose, theres no way zika can beat Bin
[0:26:09] Swimhornett: @Raja888 Yeah likely not but bin can be beat when he gets ahead in lane. I also think LNG have been handicapping themselves with malphite
[0:26:29] Mastermunchies: how much do you guys make gambling on lpl and what are the best websites?
[0:26:44] 322Heroo: xddICANT
[0:27:42] Raja888: @Swimhornett Yea I just think both teams are evenly matched in other roles but top is hugely in favor of BLG. will be interesting to see Elk Vs Bin though
[0:27:47] erengamer3: :)
[0:28:08] chrisrox22: FPX vs IG was dire watching. hope today is better
[0:28:11] Raja888: ELK VS GALA*
[0:29:31] Raja888: Fun Fact: All three Chinese world champion teams EDG,IG,FPX are ranked below 10 right now
[0:29:34] erengamer3: :)
[0:29:34] Moobot: All info of the LPL 2023 Summer Schedule can be found here: https://lolesports.com/schedule?leagues=lpl
[0:29:47] SoulSnorlax: @Raja888 Bin been playing lots of malphite too
[0:30:11] Swimhornett: Yeah I feel that but honestly scout is better than xiaohu in my opinion and I think tarzan and gala can play well and win their roles. Ur def right tho in that BLG is a strong favorite
[0:30:18] 스팀매니아: I guess todays winner, EDG WBG LNG. <3
[0:30:44] Raja888: @Swimhornett Xiaohu is in WBG
[0:31:21] SoulSnorlax: EDG needs to rebuild
[0:31:35] Swimhornett: @Raja888 my bad im tired af. scout is better than yagao tho for sure imo
[0:31:37] Raja888: @SoulSnorlax I think he has realized to beat JDG he needs to match weakside 369 so hes practicing that role now
[0:32:05] SoulSnorlax: @Raja888 Yeah, i think being able to play carry and tanks are needed
[0:32:11] Raja888: @Swimhornett yes you are right mid is favored to LNG thats my bad
[0:32:58] JoshWick_Tv: 1 raiders from josherm_rs have joined! 
[0:33:29] DonEladio: for ever NODDERS
[0:33:40] vigilantjustice: NODDERS
[0:33:49] SoulSnorlax: Bedge
[0:33:57] Raja888: What do you guys think about TES VS JDG this week, who takes it?
[0:34:08] SoulSnorlax: JDG
[0:34:22] SoulSnorlax: However, JKL been playing really good though
[0:34:31] DonEladio: NODDERS
[0:34:52] captainkrajick: JKL always plays good
[0:34:57] captainkrajick: He just has 1 random turbo int
[0:34:57] Raja888: @SoulSnorlax JKL and Rookie are playing like its 2018 again thats scary for sure
[0:35:04] 애플민트홀릭: What's BGM?
[0:35:11] PlzN0: @captainkrajick and thats what ppl remember only sadly
[0:35:13] captainkrajick: JKL plays normal for the whole year, and then once per year he completely runs it down
[0:35:22] captainkrajick: You have to take that into account
[0:35:36] Raja888: @captainkrajick yeah I think JKL should go to asian games over GALA or ELK
[0:35:50] captainkrajick: GALA is also insane tbh
[0:35:56] tesudinho25: tes 2-0 bblg
[0:35:59] captainkrajick: GALA or Jackey is fine

[0:41:26] zenapx: lets go Uzi
[0:41:49] vigilantjustice: AL is fantastic, they just need to work on communication, pings, map awareness, ward placement, item management, champ selection, skill shots, CS'ing, dragon plays, baron plays, positioning, laning, early game, mid game, late game, and getting kills
[0:41:59] hello5676543: UZI Fraud
[0:42:07] rxthunder: sad uzi wont even be able to get to worlds
[0:42:21] xBadNess_: guys how i go back in the stream?
[0:42:24] 多久是以后: Uzi is the best player
[0:43:15] DevinBookerTruther: Bin is Zeus father
[0:44:11] rxthunder: any potential upsets or is it just JDG TES BLG and LNG for worlds?
[0:44:38] 스팀매니아: LUL LUL LUL
[0:45:29] captainkrajick: @rxthunder JDG TES LNG OMG obvsiouly
[0:45:44] captainkrajick: imagine not having OMG in your top 4
[0:45:51] vigilantjustice: TES vs. BRO for World Championship, heard it here first
[0:45:53] rxthunder: u think BLG will be knocked out?
[0:46:13] rxthunder: i mean im more LCK viewer but didnt BLG slap both of them?
[0:46:37] tesudinho25: tes 1 top 2 jdg  3 blg
[0:46:56] DevinBookerTruther: @rxthunder BLG and JDG for sure the 2 other spots probably gonna be between TES LNG Weibo OMG and EDG
[0:47:26] captainkrajick: @DevinBookerTruther I don't think EDG will be competing. WE is more likely
[0:47:39] spreadie: TES ain't winning anything unless Wayward peaks PepeLaugh
[0:47:39] Moobot: @Moobot This is patch 13.11! You can find the patch notes here: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-13-11-notes/
[0:47:48] captainkrajick: Uzi is kind of a mid-lower tier ADC atm, he needs more time
[0:48:15] captainkrajick: And Ale is 50/50 as usual
[0:48:51] 多久是以后: EDG is on the verge of being eliminated
[0:49:01] DevinBookerTruther: @captainkrajick WE looks good so far the split but keep in mind that they haven't played any top teams yet
[0:49:03] captainkrajick: @툰느릅나무후기서문 they have 10 more series
[0:49:17] mickey_1012: @captainkrajick uzi still plays?
[0:49:23] mickey_1012: i thought he retired again
[0:49:39] 多久是以后: EDG situation is bad
[0:49:43] captainkrajick: @mickey_1012 He's on screen lmao
[0:49:46] rxthunder: he had the doublelift itch @mickey_1012
[0:49:46] spreadie: @mickey_1012 look at the screen PepeLaugh
[0:49:58] Okkers: never retire play until your eyes fall out
[0:50:01] mickey_1012: hahaha yea now hes on screen
[0:50:03] huefulphoenix: blg or lng
[0:50:15] captainkrajick: @huefulphoenix 50/50
[0:50:20] rxthunder: blg maybe
[0:50:22] captainkrajick: @huefulphoenix we going to game 3
[0:50:37] captainkrajick: then again LNG got Home Stadium advantage
[0:50:39] huefulphoenix: POGGERS
[0:50:44] mickey_1012: im just waiting to buy AL worlds skins next year, cant wait
[0:50:49] captainkrajick: so LNG 2-1 probably
[0:50:51] DevinBookerTruther: BLG gonna win tonight
[0:50:52] spreadie: Surely WBG 2-0 so we can watch BLG LNG live
[0:51:09] DevinBookerTruther: Elk > Gala
