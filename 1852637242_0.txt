[3:11:53] revenge1337tv: yea but Look at LPL it has more potential like huge names, organizations, stories, they could easly sell it in europe or other instead of only in china
[3:12:18] eytdgd: Kappa
[3:12:32] jetlagging1: @revenge1337tv if you're Riot the last thing you want is LPL taking audience away from other regions.  LPL is the one league that can sustain for the longest time
