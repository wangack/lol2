[3:41:02] bongdobrucer: I mean, rly, why is na major still? I get lec. They did the dolphins trick, came up from under, amused us all, and went back under. Still, they are the hope of the west

[3:46:08] axelan1: @Darkness_enjoyer except dota players get peanuts for their contract if the dont win
[3:46:09] bongdobrucer: @hash7272828 top league streamer does better, and he's from Brazil. So, how fkd up is that
[3:46:13] bewbiemaster69: reviewing the game while commentating
[3:46:15] myprecioussosnowy: @t1debringer I'm not disagreeing that NA league is garbage, but it is RIOT 's cash cow, have you seen the amount of ads in that league? literally every aspect of the game is monetized, if you think of LCS as the shitty but money making league, and the other leagues being good but operate at a deficit, it evens things out, this is why RIOT will never let go of LCS
[3:46:16] G4Geralt: @Clothia he is looking to himself. He is too handsome
[3:46:17] Dieghoull: Why this caster on the left is always looking like he is doing something else and like we are here for him not he for us. He is contantly not looking to camera zero interest in the audience.

[3:47:30] miyoshi2137: @Clothia Nah he is not. Also I dont care how people look while I want to see casters that are doing something to the audience to take our interest of them speaking.
[3:47:52] leomazzz: Scout is unironically top 3 mid laners rn
[3:47:57] vodermol: doggo trash player .
[3:48:03] myprecioussosnowy: @lovefreerobux that could be true (probably is) but RIOT will not shoot themselves in the foot to get rid of LCS

[3:48:28] miyoshi2137: Guy on the left seems narcistics for me and this way of talking. Guys give us a good caster please!
[3:48:31] Dieghoull: LNG only wina against teams of farmers
[3:48:48] bongdobrucer: @myprecioussosnowy I get your point . However, they might have to change. Orgs seem kinda tired for paying an apartment for subpar players. Still, what amazes me the most, is how lpl and lck haven't made a move against this bs yet
[3:49:06] ssweetsorrow: caster in dota2 dead, lakad matatag no more 😂
[3:49:11] xelotlord: why am i getting an AD??? hello adblock why didnt you block this ad?
[3:49:15] myprecioussosnowy: @lovefreerobux if LCS runs at a deficit then RIOT is utter stupid for keeping it, but I don't think that's the case
[3:49:22] Turtle1412: who won?
[3:49:23] Beanp0t: casters talk about other stuff in real sports too, it keeps the cast lively isntead of a robot caster "Ok theres another cs ok he poke ok he poke ok he cs ok"

[3:51:20] ayaooaz: investors are paying for everything actually. they make no profit
[3:51:24] myprecioussosnowy: @t1debringer LCS has been trash for more than a decade nothing is gonna change, it'll be this way for another decade, the only thing RIOT can do is give international competitions spots of LCS to other leagues

[3:53:07] Darkness_enjoyer: I haven't seen any League player going into the chat of Dota stream chat and mock Dota, though. I guess, it doesn't matter since the chat is only filled with bots
[3:53:10] bewbiemaster69: nah League community don't even care about Dota, yet these Dota players keep visiting our communities to say how much more complicated their game is. Complicated doesnt equal better

[3:54:35] professorcrud: WASSUP BEIJING
[3:54:36] bongdobrucer: @myprecioussosnowy that's my point. IMHO it should happen. Separate teams in more tiers. Minor and major doesn't cut it. Keep na pet with 2 spots. Give away their 3rd to a different regions. Or put it up for grabs between 2nd places of minors

[5:58:45] boomatti: catJAM
[5:58:48] ye1l: Knight, Kanavi and 369 outplaying BLG=Ruler gets credit... I don't think he's bad but people praising him endlessly for other people's plays just makes me want to see him fail more than anything else
[5:58:48] myprecioussosnowy: @eschu there's a thing called "worlds" and stop saying "best"  then if you don't want an opposing view
[5:58:50] MoonMan_AK: JDG won't win worlds they're cosplaying DK 2022 which is sad
[5:58:55] jessicajanesyd: JDG TOO STRONG GIGACHAD
[5:59:00] rookiierooks: @cyrrus223 they can ez if the dont pick renek viego mid/jgl that draft was sus af
[5:59:25] Kaatsuraa: @MoonMan_AK who is beating them ?
[5:59:25] enzadeninothefirst: ruler was pretty clearly accepted by everyone as the best adc in the world last year and this year
[5:59:33] MaraudingBacon: @ye1l some thing you have to consider. Ruler is a Giant insurance policy. you can go ham and make the plays. to take the risks because you have ruler in pocket for late game.
[5:59:39] jessicajanesyd: THEY GONNA KNOW MY NAME
[5:59:47] hokage1775: Jokar love

[6:00:00] boomatti: @MoonMan_AK 2022 dk lost to adc problems..
[6:00:01] Eschu: @myprecioussosnowy he wasnt the best last year just because he didnt win worlds? deft mustve been the best adc by this logic surely!
[6:00:08] yousocute5678: 0-2 script for today
[6:00:13] yousocute5678: chill out
[6:00:19] mainanalyst: Teams still can't draft on this patch, red side still winning :)
[6:00:23] myprecioussosnowy: @enzadeninothefirst that's just your opinion, ruler "best" but flopping at worlds? how is that a narrative
[6:00:25] jessicajanesyd: Strong 0-2 script
[6:00:30] rookiierooks: @ye1l the fact with Ruler is that hes the most consistent adc for a while now , i pref personaly the lpl adc like Elk/JKL ect but you cant deny that Ruler is one of the best of all time
[6:00:44] KYLE_IS_ALWAYS_WRONG_: 0-2 day
[6:00:49] ye1l: @enzadeninothefirst Ruler wouldn't had won a single game for TES in 2022 summer playoffs, JKL completely 1v9d them to game 5 of finals. JKL>>>drooler in 2022, so far this split JKL has been better too
[6:01:07] YongWuYY: 0-2 ！
[6:01:21] Brucie67: 7 adds, Well that's all the games I'm viewing today
[6:01:22] amendoafrita: they still playing ? im in 1/9 ad e.e
[6:01:25] myprecioussosnowy: @eschu winning worlds sure help the narrtive of being the best.. if ruler won, sure there's no argument, but easily arguments can be made in this case, you just won't accept the possibility that ruler is not that great
[6:01:28] bluesclues96: @ye1l ruler had the lowest damage share in spring out of all adcs, i don't know how people are still calling him one of the best...
[6:01:33] ye1l: @rookiierooks i mean Ruler has literally been drooling half this split getting astrogapped by light and inting into Lpc

[6:02:21] terta79: Do jokerlove fangirls still mald over comp manhandling jokerlove 4Head
[6:02:21] ye1l: @bluesclues96 lowest damage share with literally the best setup to do damage in the entire world and his toplaner is perma on tanks which should raise his damage share
[6:02:36] bluesclues96: @ye1l @Ash351 not dps, damage SHARE, he was getting outdamaged by 369 on TANKS
[6:02:55] bluesclues96: @ye1l crazy
[6:02:56] Darkapplez: Why are all JKL fans so delusionally in love with him?

[6:04:08] 니이이야오옹: @bluesclues96 stop lying u liar
[6:04:10] myprecioussosnowy: here is a very easy example, EDG winning worlds, same year you can easily say Viper was the nest adc of that year, but if Viper didn't win? if you say Viper was the best, there would be an opposing view, stop living inside your bubble
[6:04:23] PACEFALMAU: Concerned dentist
[6:04:40] bluesclues96: @니이이야오옹 Pepega
[6:04:42] rookiierooks: @myprecioussosnowy Viper was clearly the best adc BYYYYYYY FAAAAAR on 2022 even this year hes jailed by his team
[6:04:44] 쿵기덕쿵더더덕: who is the win tes jdg?

[6:06:44] rookiierooks: @myprecioussosnowy Ruler got big stats cause hes a Geng player wich means hes fking safe player that will never flash in so ppl sees him never dies and says hes the best , hes one of the best but not the best
[6:06:53] ye1l: I'm always gonna be an Uzi supporter even if he's washed GIGACHAD same with TheShy
