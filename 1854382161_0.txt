[7:30:12] frenziedmaul01: When TheShy crosses the street, cars look both ways. You can‚Äôt use ‚ÄòTheShy‚Äô‚Äô as your password because it is ‚Äòtoo strong‚Äô. TheShy wakes up his alarm clock every morning. Ghosts sit around camp fires & tell each other TheShy stories. TheShy doesn‚Äôt make left turns, because everything he does is right.
