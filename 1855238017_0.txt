[3:12:34] shadowxerianer: @EclipseLair But that is basically waht  Op shit is imo. You always play what is best for the situation, whether that's a single broken champ or team comp who has the best synergy/counters sth. Every game has that.

[4:15:52] LuvUtho: @LuvUtho I see what you mean, playing soloq just isn't the same as playing in the competitive scene which has tremendously evolved in the last couple of years. While I don't think Uzi has anything left to prove, I'd like him to see perform in a team that enables him to unleash his full potential, not really knowing how high it is after his break.
[4:15:57] luuuke07: 2 - SORRY
