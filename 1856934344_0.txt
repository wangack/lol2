[6:11:28] bluesclues96: @ye1l even though he was coinflip last year it was obvious that he had the seeds to be one of the best supports in the world
[6:11:29] imacm: I think I’m good lol
[6:11:29] z5152459: @z5152459 You do realise this whole narrative isn't just one redditor's comment, but a whole wave of tweets, youtube trolls and any other media right?
[6:11:34] vendedordeazucar: @aaandrade1999 Tiankos is so iregular this is the main reason why he is called like this lol
[6:11:35] s4vemys0ul: Western Teams won't win worlds until they switch to BO3 format change my mind <3

[6:11:43] ye1l: @z5152459 On was already better than either of them before they even joined the team though

[6:12:10] BLGWorlds2024: @z5152459 Yes. But after the last Worlds I gave up on it. It seems like there is some kind of blockage. It's sad because he at max level is a great jungler.

[7:53:09] notrealdamage: he knows english
[7:53:22] myprecioussosnowy: China probably chose those players because of "seniority" too, and Jiejie, JKL, and Meiko are all worlds winners
[7:53:24] arctictokito: CHINA should of just pick BLg as there team and they would win easily

[7:53:52] arctictokito: BLG>LPL AND LCK
[7:54:08] myprecioussosnowy: if you look at the game from a bozo's standpoint, 3 world champs are easily better picks than the younger and unaccomplished players
[7:54:29] myprecioussosnowy: @devinbookertruther I'm just finding ways for those picks to make sense
[7:54:53] arctictokito: ELK > JKL china instead lose even ruler would be better pick

[7:55:27] roarz23: 4Head Kappa
[7:55:34] myprecioussosnowy: @arctictokito ruler is korean tho, so China can't have him as representative I don't think
[7:55:35] selfmadepeach: kr only needs to give jkl 40 bucks and he will throw
[7:55:50] DevinBookerTruther: @myprecioussosnowy kenzhu is just biased thats why he picked 2 of his players
[7:55:58] arctictokito: Oh crap I forgot
