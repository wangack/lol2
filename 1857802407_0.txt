[0:58:27] LunanaBunnystax: @PrinCesinhaQQSF he technically can but his entire team just runs it so hard

[0:58:57] dirtykurtym: Deft*
[0:59:12] LunanaBunnystax: Since his re-debut I've seen 2 series where he gigagaps the enemy adc, making their lives miserable, only to see the other 2 lanes going 0/4 and 0/3
[0:59:17] Orphean: a newer player like Uzi is still learning the ropes Kappa
[0:59:25] icant_kekw: Fraud

[1:00:44] LunanaBunnystax: I think Uzi is the only player ever to have the proud status of passively changing the playstyle of a team for him
[1:00:57] LunanaBunnystax: regardless of how they played, if he's there, it's automatically "PROTECT MR. PRESIDENT"
[1:00:57] CesinhaZikadorLover: @lunanabunnystax dont you think Skt is top 3 best world teams?
