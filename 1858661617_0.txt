[3:57:53] sinistryfour: This draft was a mess by OMG. They were all in on Samira, if she wasn't able to carry no one could. Aphelios eventually outscaled
[3:58:30] hiuregod: and tbh FPX's comp just hard counters Samira @sinistryfour
[3:58:42] xelotlord: renekton is bad without some lead. cause he doesnt scale to late game. his early/mid.
[3:58:48] sinistryfour: @hiuregod Also true
[3:58:52] hiuregod: she couldn't do anything
[3:58:53] abusaeedweng2x: @sinistryfour dont explain it was a throw lol from the start
[3:59:15] cw1123: When to pay?
[3:59:29] sinistryfour: For you guys that make bets I think you should try to understand it. You see champ select and you make your decisions after. Either wait 10 minutes into the game or after draft
[3:59:34] Geeds__: monkaHmm
[3:59:41] sinistryfour: If you blindly follow the teams without seeing draft that's kinda insane and unpredictable

[4:40:10] sinistryfour: Betting on the under kills when a team is snowballing hard can be great. Usually on these early snowball games we have a wild early game but then the team that's losing can't find any more kills. So you take a higher line of under 26.5 kills or even 30.5 kills and you do well

[4:44:49] lfishl: but my friend cried and said he's not on lpl again
[4:45:08] Pandguinn: LPL has some banger songs
[4:45:14] slarenoff: catJAM
[4:45:20] lfishl: yes its kind of essential for like LDL
[4:45:25] caucasianamerican8870: My favorite champ is Blitzcrank.
[4:45:31] dejvsterlul: @sinistryfour No but must have seen the LPL classic "Worst team wins game 1 then gets 20 min stomped game 2 and 3"
[4:45:33] dirtyturtle33: @Pandguinn sounds like fifa soundtrack
[4:45:40] gurbetsky: name of song

[4:46:08] gurbetsky: dudududududududududud
[4:46:17] sinistryfour: @dejvsterlul But that's normal in every league. They win game 1 because the favorite got cocky with a bad draft or wasn't giving too much credit to the underdogs and then they just are the better team and win the next 2 games
[4:46:24] caucasianamerican8870: Isnt LCS doing single matches not best of 3?
[4:46:24] Moobot: All info of the LPL 2023 Summer Schedule can be found here: https://lolesports.com/schedule?leagues=lpl
[4:46:27] mabex97: If FPX ban monkey and pick annie and aphelios, they will win ez
[4:46:31] sinistryfour: @dejvsterlul That's normal. It will probably happen here in the OMG game too but who knows
[4:46:32] abbyjo103: lets goo
[4:46:49] dejvsterlul: @sinistryfour for sure dude
[4:47:05] xelotlord: my guess no ones gonna go samira in both teams now. hahaha
[4:47:17] gbaby05555: @abbyjo103 Whattt
[4:47:27] sinistryfour: @dejvsterlul I don't bet in the outcome of the overall result but only match by match. I watch the champ select and then make my decision or wait 10 min into the game and do it
[4:47:38] happyNLB: G3?
[4:47:41] sinistryfour: @dejvsterlul So I get away from those wild comebacks etc
[4:47:43] ljpnb666: Bo will get benched kekw
[4:47:50] caucasianamerican8870: This dood be lookin like rumble irl
[4:48:07] happyNLB: he just did @ljpnb666 KEKW
[4:48:19] xelotlord: betting everything on your favorite team no matter what is an automatic lose.
[4:48:29] suchunluckything: DELETED LUL
[4:48:35] sinistryfour: yes that's 100% true
[4:48:37] ENHINK: Predictions? Who takes 3rd
[4:48:45] caucasianamerican8870: @xelotlord My favorite team is T1 because theyre the best team and they never lose ever.
[4:48:46] ljpnb666: Vit will smash omg
[4:48:57] sinistryfour: Let's see draft and then I give you my prediction
[4:49:07] xelotlord: @caucasianamerican8870 "never"
[4:49:18] myprecioussosnowy: @caucasianamerican8870 true and real
[4:49:20] lfishl: OMG
[4:49:27] sinistryfour: @caucasianamerican8870 They got 2-0'd by KT Rolsters. I think KT is looking like the more dominant team
[4:49:34] happyNLB: ivern ban is still surreal to see
[4:49:40] sinistryfour: T1 get cocky with bad drafts
[4:49:45] caucasianamerican8870: KT LUL sters?
[4:49:47] gbaby05555: Nobody bets on map three ???
[4:49:55] AR3iTeR: any mods here? wanna post a clip
[4:49:56] najusmont: FP APHELIOS PLEASE

[4:50:13] PLAY09Sadox: new predic please
[4:50:23] xelotlord: i would agree if it was young faker. but current faker is powered down. any midlaner can beat him now
[4:50:27] smokedatshit: @gbaby05555 omg i think but im waiting for picks
[4:50:34] delac_ttv: whos the best team in the world?

[4:51:31] xelotlord: @xelotlord im on fire?
[4:51:45] FistThePlebs: shanji rumble monkaHmm
[4:51:50] caucasianamerican8870: Jin Air Greenwings put up considerable fight every pro match before being relegated and ultimately disbanded.
[4:52:03] ENHINK: Moobot pog
[4:52:09] caucasianamerican8870: Oh lets go baby
[4:52:17] delac_ttv: Jdg ruler is  fire. but KT rolster looking like an Aerospace Grade team
[4:52:19] caucasianamerican8870: All in FPX picked fuckin Blitzcrank
[4:52:23] alkaxy2: FPX dont wanna win, the worst draft ever
[4:52:23] smokedatshit: @xelotlord he isnt that bad
[4:52:24] ungeflurmelt: @caucasianamerican8870 it is best of 3
[4:52:30] abbyjo103: <3
[4:52:38] caucasianamerican8870: This is 3
[4:52:48] PLAY09Sadox: ohhhh blitzz :O

[4:53:04] caucasianamerican8870: MrDestructoid -------C WutFace
[4:53:04] Pandguinn: Blitz pog
[4:53:05] ljpnb666: ez win for fpx
[4:53:08] PLAY09Sadox: blitz = win possibale
[4:53:25] myprecioussosnowy: sej vs vi ResidentSleeper
[4:53:26] caucasianamerican8870: Pog 2009 champ
[4:53:27] phxstick: QIYANA Pog
[4:53:28] BroderBill: Pog
[4:53:28] ENHINK: Possibale ‚ù§Ô∏è
[4:53:40] sinistryfour: @ENHINK FPX are all in on the mid game domination. If Vi and Blitz can force some early kills there can be an upset. I think this match is an over kills game. If in 10 minutes FPX don't get a lead we probably have OMG win
[4:53:40] EdSheeranCatfish: Nah Mode game2???
[4:53:43] caucasianamerican8870: Pog Champion largely unchanged since original release 2009
[4:53:46] Fruty_Pebbles_4: imagine sending results now
[4:53:46] noheart4z: QI AYAYA
[4:53:46] smokedatshit: @ENHINK hahahahah
[4:53:46] MihawkR7: fpx draft win
[4:53:49] xelotlord: @smokedatshit i didnt say faker is so bad. im saying his not anymore the unkillable demon or what is he named. back then no midlaner can beat him. now his beatable.
[4:53:49] PLAY09Sadox: gooo on fpx ^^
[4:53:50] sinistryfour: I'm going with the over 26.5 kills
[4:53:52] funkyoumod: Gamba
[4:53:59] ezmoneysniperbangbang: yes qiyana! all in fpx
[4:54:01] DarkPower9000: that is so int, this is gonna be a player gap if Omg actually win this
[4:54:08] alkaxy2: @MihawkR7 i dont like this draft[
[4:54:15] PLAY09Sadox: oh the comp fpx mamaaa
[4:54:24] jamazo: omg has better draft lol
[4:54:27] sinistryfour: It seems like an over kills game
[4:54:33] xelotlord: ohhh shiitt SEJ + Rumble. wow
[4:54:35] caucasianamerican8870: Milio is extremely broken, but ultimately just another target for Blitzcrank.
[4:54:40] sinistryfour: Qiyana and Annie want fights, FPX bot wants fight, Vi wants ganks
[4:54:47] lex_kaiser: Btw its fuking irrelevant how many kills fall bithes
[4:54:47] filhao: over kill
[4:54:49] renannsilva: ALL IN FPX,
[4:54:57] santinoxGG: FailFish FailFish FailFishÔøºÔøº FailFish
[4:55:03] backupbecauseiwasbanned: Can we please get a match that isn't a complete and utter demolit
[4:55:17] sinistryfour: @Swiss_Import they do but this is probably the best draft for FPX to win the game 3 because it's pure force on the early and mid game, if they find kills they can snowball
[4:55:38] ENHINK: FPX 2-1
[4:55:42] sinistryfour: @ENHINK Did you see my text that I sent you like 2 min ago?
[4:55:47] jamazo: @sinistryfour fair but they lack damage cant get through milio peel

[4:56:14] sinistryfour: @Swiss_Import Blitz should target Aphelios or Milio with his hooks, let's see how it goes

[4:59:19] myprecioussosnowy: 2 kills include fb better than 13 cs lmao
[4:59:19] PopKornq: FPX is just 0 teamplay team, they should pick only solo lanes cuz they cant teamfight anyway
[4:59:36] hermeneutist: LNG WE starting soon at Xi'an, emote only incoming
[4:59:38] lfishl: I don't think sion dive is in favor at all
[4:59:41] PopKornq: @myprecioussosnowy FPX had fb
[4:59:43] xelotlord: they already have pressure on the jungler. they could pocket that pressure..why commit and throw a risky dive on a Milio.. game 3 is getting bad for fpx. hahahahah what a fiesta
[4:59:45] heyremjr: they rly gave shanji rumble again kekw
[4:59:48] ENHINK: @sinistryfour top 5 worst dives easily
[4:59:56] sinistryfour: the dive was so bad aphelios got free gold too
[5:00:05] caucasianamerican8870: Flash hook poggers
[5:00:12] pociteh: Hook support LUL LUL
[5:00:12] sinistryfour: that's why OMG odds are still really low
[5:00:30] sinistryfour: FPX will keep forcing fights to even have a chance
[5:00:36] sinistryfour: it seems like my over kills will be in good shape

[5:01:15] Giovanilol: @PopKornq plus are the better team of course odds will be low
[5:01:17] sinistryfour: @K7_lIM OMG champs just outscale and Aphelios got huge gold on that failed dive early on. If FPX bot lane doesn't get a huge lead they just lose after 15 minutes or so
[5:01:17] ENHINK: @sinistryfour what's your bets in g3?
[5:01:28] myprecioussosnowy: shanji rumble with a free kill too

[5:01:36] sinistryfour: @ENHINK Only over 26.5 kills at 1.92 odds
[5:01:39] xelotlord: rumble has a lot of pressure now in top side and jungle
[5:01:40] MakewayY: need a triple kill bros ok
[5:01:59] sinistryfour: @ENHINK They were taken instantly after draft. FPX just sent the message that they wanted blood LUL
[5:02:08] ENHINK: @sinistryfour alright, gl!
[5:02:14] ProboscisLord: @sinistryfour i`m hoping for a 30:01 game LUL

[5:02:35] tiago_sem_y: when does my weibo play?
[5:02:46] Aerosunodos: Fpx can win
[5:02:53] sinistryfour: @ProboscisLord It can happen if FPX get the first few drakes and some kills. Eventually if OMG stabilize they can win.
[5:03:07] yc7231696: shanji gigachad
[5:03:16] sinistryfour: I mean OMG are already ahead at this point. FPX's comp needed a 1k or 1.5k lead at this point
[5:03:21] ProboscisLord: @sinistryfour g3 so both teams will play carefully imo
[5:03:28] xelotlord: im still not sure with the qiyana pick here. but looks interesting cause you dont always see this champ.
