[4:16:15] quackerquack123: What is with all this LCS hate? As an European I have to say they are not as bad as you portray them; in fact they are worse, much worse to the point of me and my peers wondering are they even playing league at this point or do they just play checkers on their screen.

[4:20:48] BLG_worlds_2024: @K7_lIM bc theres 17 teams so the players are spread out
[4:20:50] prestoking: Let's not stop the choking it's better than the gameplay at this point

[4:22:29] flappersandclowns: RA scum rats
[4:22:35] zuzu295: 2:0 for sure
[4:22:50] quackerquack123: @K7_lIM imo it is just due to the most teams having mechanically strong players, and as such they can get early leads even vs teams better than them. The real difference between good and bad LPL teams lies mostly in how well they teamfight and work together
[4:23:18] Dekharen: I think it's so grief to buy a pot on Nocturne, he has a completely healthy clear and wants to get to 6 with some items, that pot just delays that
[4:23:52] jinxtoesucker: oh no 50 gold delayed whatever will he do
[4:24:11] Dextroslol: -50g thats gg '
[4:24:45] fauzyramdhani15: F5k aja RA
[4:25:08] Dextroslol: i love how they make the point and click champs do more damage than skillshot champs LUL

[4:25:39] rodrigoc1219: mm
[4:25:58] Dekharen: @jinxtoesucker 50 gold in a game where income is limited on a role with very low economy that cannot be accelerated does matter. 50 gold is a 4 cs lead in lane, it adds up really fast.
[4:26:04] pzac_6: Why RA always play good against good teams and suck vs trash teams?
[4:26:05] BLG_worlds_2024: @Dextroslol jg health pot dif

[4:26:33] Moobot: The host of today is Wendy! (https://twitter.com/Wendy5544)
[4:26:35] Dekharen: It's almost as if you can do mistakes without losing the game who would have guessed
[4:27:04] chrisrox22: LUL
[4:27:07] prowny86: clash of trash
[4:27:17] rhino_tohsaka: ANNIE MECHS
[4:27:18] jinxtoesucker: @jinxtoesucker ur right if AL bottles this game its because of the health pot
[4:27:31] BLG_worlds_2024: laning against annie seems like the most annoying thing ive seen in pro play
[4:27:33] Sekratan: Harder, strive Harder
[4:28:00] khazzny: Toplaners Sadge
[4:28:07] Dextroslol: bot gap? just go top PepeLaugh
[4:28:11] Dekharen: @jinxtoesucker No, but if you don't buy the pot, you get to back earlier, you get your items earlier, and for example you don't lose your wolves to wukong walking into your jungle because your krugs are still up.

[4:29:12] Dextroslol: u kill gromp and ur full hp from half
[4:29:22] vlade_wadinski: So AL actually quite decent bottom-mid table team these days?
[4:29:43] Sheyi_Ojo: @vlade_wadinski sometimes
[4:29:46] BLG_worlds_2024: @vlade_wadinski YEP AL has been better than their record for awhile now
[4:29:47] Dekharen: @Dextroslol not at all. In particular you might want it on a weak early jungler that takes time to clear camps, takes damage, and risks getting invaded
[4:29:51] mredo: RA plays so bad
[4:29:54] airjordan420: Iboy penta incoming
[4:29:55] KaiJun_y: Iboy getting so much gold
[4:29:58] vlade_wadinski: I boy Smurfing?
[4:30:33] 台服佛爺神: 63
[4:30:40] Dekharen: @Dextroslol but that's not the case for nocturne. Look it's fkn 12 minutes in and it's still sitting in his inventory. This is a pro player, not a normal game, you'd expect them to do that kind of simple optimization
[4:30:41] Dextroslol: @Dekharen nocturne still hasnt used his pot... you were right 5Head
[4:30:47] Dextroslol: -50g
[4:30:47] Sheyi_Ojo: Need some Ksante magic
[4:31:01] 台服佛爺神: 2
[4:31:13] pzac_6: come on RA do something
[4:31:32] SinCross: why is jamada so quiet
[4:31:37] Dekharen: @Dextroslol like he's gonna sell it and it's a free cannon being lost x.x
[4:31:37] Moobot: @Moobot This is patch 13.12! You can find the patch notes here: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-13-12-notes/
[4:31:41] reap3rk: RA KEKW
[4:31:42] jinxtoesucker: cmon RA force nocturne to pop the health pot
[4:31:44] BroderBill: @Dextroslol Megabrain, saving 30 gold is huge for hitting the powerspike!
[4:31:45] duterte6969: RIP MONEY FRAUD RA
[4:31:46] abusaeedweng2x: RA AFK

[4:32:34] JRB92891: @abusaeedweng2x It's 2k\
[4:32:51] Dekharen: @Dextroslol it's more than 50 gold, because gold snowballs. Getting an earlier back means having better economy, more time for covering or farming, and there's the whole shutdown system that comes into play too
[4:32:59] cryptoo71: aRAm
[4:33:13] jinxtoesucker: so ur saying he lost 500 gold because of a health pot
[4:33:24] slarenoff: if TES lose today i might actually have to stop cheering for them
[4:33:26] mredo: ksante cs hahaha
[4:33:46] tontton12345: ra just win teamfights ?
[4:33:51] Dextroslol: @Dekharen you should be a coach with that healthpot knowledge
[4:33:53] Dekharen: @jinxtoesucker no, I'm saying he lost some tempo and a bit of gold by doing something that is useless for a pro player
[4:33:54] acbossx: WutFace WutFace WutFace

[4:34:38] Sheyi_Ojo: 1.5k lead not too bad, lets go RA
[4:34:47] BroderBill: @Dextroslol Interest rate for gold Pog What about if you need the potion to be healthy in jungle in case of invade or you want to gank?

[4:35:15] jinxtoesucker: if nocturne didnt buy that health pot it would probably be a 5K gold lead for AL
[4:35:26] abusaeedweng2x: Clown 9
[4:35:32] Dekharen: @Dextroslol @BroderBill I agree, some champions do need that sometimes, but nocturne is not one of them. Noc's passive is about a million healthpots

[5:20:57] mikadreyar: @mister_keno you know there is a salary cap in LPL right?
[5:21:00] mister_keno: I guess their contracts aren’t public
[5:21:15] MiinALove: @mister_keno they bypass the salary cap with "sponsorship" deals
[5:21:17] Allenownz: What’s cap in league
[5:21:17] pociteh: TES should replace tian to be able to compete with BLG and JDG

[5:21:45] mister_keno: No I was just asking a general question of how much they make. Like are they considered pro athletes in their homelands
[5:21:51] shiny_chocobo: TES should get Wei and Breathe
[5:21:57] mikadreyar: @mister_keno ye ofc I'm just saying those 3 players are definitly at salary cap and then JKL probs earns a load extra
[5:22:04] mister_keno: 6 mill is insane to play a video game
[5:22:15] mister_keno: I want that life
[5:22:21] mikadreyar: @Allenownz lil bro should retire at this point he's so giga washed

[5:24:15] mister_keno: Like sitting in your computer chair for 18 hours a day. Diet consists of hot pockets and doordash
[5:24:34] mikadreyar: @mister_keno idk ur just saying u want that life when its completely unrealistic and probably in practise also very mentally and physically exhausting
