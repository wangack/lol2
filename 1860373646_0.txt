[7:44:34] MarxVendetta: @italianpriest00 Maybe she did a cosplay? The only thing I know is that they were spamming that when the MVP interview popped up.
[7:44:37] Eschu: @marxvendetta I mean I was talking about current uzi but even prime Uzi was a long time ago where the skill level was just lower so either way ruler is better

[7:46:45] Eschu: @superhardcoremobilegamer yeah and hes continued to he at the top for all this time btw
[7:46:50] agua_de_panela_: Uzi won?
[7:46:55] TheGreatHaugslien: sup
[7:47:19] MarxVendetta: @Eschu Yeah but not because of skill difference. Uzi has had health issues that kept him out of pro play.
