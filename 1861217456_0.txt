[4:35:54] sota_cat: @megumi2212 that was jkl xayah，not kaisa
[4:35:58] SirGarland: Throw classic
[4:36:01] mainanalyst: yeah RNG bombed out at worlds 2018, will the same fate await JDG this year?
[4:36:15] iskylit: Rookie and jackeylove GIGACHAD
[4:36:20] ZombieSeries: <3
[4:36:26] nylon081: nenhum br aq?
[4:36:39] z5152459: @mainanalyst I just don' see it unfortunately. JDG looks like Golden State Warriors with KD
[4:36:39] fargo8: How much kills rookie got ?
[4:36:59] jinxtoesucker: what time is omg game
[4:36:59] sota_cat: @mainanalyst no，cuz jdg roster fit any meta
[4:37:07] Learic: @mainanalyst Very difficult, RNG had weaknesses in 2018, JDG seem unstoppable
[4:37:07] makaveli1213: Strive kills how many?
[4:37:23] mainanalyst: fair call, JDG do seem like allrounders
[4:37:24] z5152459: Actually, JDG looks like 90s Bulls with KD and Steph Curry
[4:37:47] mainanalyst: i think there are 3 teams that can hammer LCK teams now, add OMG to the mix
[4:37:55] thefullsack: Who’s this caster?
[4:38:10] mainanalyst: Hysterics and Jamada
[4:38:11] sota_cat: @Learic bot，top side，mid jug，even fking carry jug，jdg fit all
[4:38:21] thefullsack: Not good
[4:38:30] noheart4z: COPIUM
[4:38:40] pnzeby: neeko kda player
[4:38:46] carryme40: no team is unstoppable, just ask T1 who keep ending up second places in finals
[4:38:51] z5152459: Wendy is the GOAT
[4:38:57] Jamada: @thefullsack  Heyge
[4:39:08] HystericsCasts: Yo for 2 years Jackeylove Kaisa was nuts no
[4:39:15] mainanalyst: yeah but difference between T1 and JDG is that JDG are not overrated
[4:39:16] z5152459: @carryme40 JDG looked invincible throughout the year though. T1 couldn't even beat RNG at MSI
[4:39:19] HystericsCasts: Uzi had 2018 but I wouldnt say his champ OG is kaisa
[4:39:20] Improbablyalive: what a cute dress!
[4:39:23] sota_cat: @z5152459 +dwade kanavi

[4:40:05] getwumboed: DoritosChip DoritosChip
[4:40:07] ivylattice: funny thing is a few weeks back when jkl was ranking he was texting gala asking what he should build on kaisa
[4:40:15] z5152459: Wendy speaks 4 languages right
[4:40:16] HystericsCasts: Uzi = Ezreal, Vayne right
[4:40:17] k7_lIm: lng will smash omg
[4:40:34] z5152459: @ivylattice JKL texts Able too for builds cause he's the theory crafter
[4:40:41] SleepingKisa: hey casters, could you please add KEKVibe? <3
[4:40:44] carryme40: JDG never faced uzi this year. I won't be so sure that JDG is even winning lpl summer yet
[4:40:46] mainanalyst: yeah Uzi can play Kaisa too, but he is god of the other two
