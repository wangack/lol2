[2:38:32] kipplerFPS: @morpheusx2001 Uzi is good but nowhere near the top right now

[2:38:49] morpheusx2001: @kipplerFPS i will just block you from all the troll comments you keep replying. No time for you BYE BLOCKED
[2:38:54] hiuregod: Uzi is ok but EDG needs to improve A LOT as a whole
[2:38:55] aguero_nuri: Ruler > lpl
[2:39:08] mclaren_ftw: Uzi can't carry if Fofo keeps ks'ing KEKW
[2:39:13] MiinALove: yea I don't think Uzi is the problem on that team KEKW
[2:39:14] kipplerFPS: @morpheusx2001 Uzi fanboy got in his feelings lmfao
[2:39:22] pociteh: Fofo WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:39:26] AyyKevin07: Lol ^°
[2:39:27] jetlagging1: Uzi is not top 5 LPL right now.
[2:39:28] ziosevielspezel: BLG are a different beast after msi they gained so much confidence there
[2:39:41] MiinALove: dont worry Foker will carry Uzi to worlds xdding
[2:39:43] DevinBookerTruther: Uzi is not a top tier ADC . Elk ruler and JKL are the top tier ADCs
[2:39:44] hiuregod: @ziosevielspezel i think both JDG and BLG are better than they were at MSI
[2:39:45] Queen_Tiem: @aguero_nuri is that why he never beat an lpl team on geng? PepeLaugh
[2:39:45] softemoBf: i think uzi will figure it out tho. being a goat isnt an accident
[2:39:53] morpheusx2001: It is a 5 men game & then you got the coach to allow you or assign you the champs / comp to play
[2:39:58] JustinGBYT: @jetlagging1 true but he would be the best adc in lck still
[2:40:00] Raja888: Hot take: BLG will beat JDG when they meet in playoffs
[2:40:00] lordgrimm04: Xayah and kaisa isn't even his best champs just insane
[2:40:09] luistricker13: lets goo
[2:40:15] JustinGBYT: @Raja888 scorching hot, they have lost like 5 series this year to them
[2:40:18] ziosevielspezel: @hiuregod true
[2:40:19] softemoBf: @Raja888 why tho?
[2:40:20] MiinALove: Pog
[2:40:25] kipplerFPS: @jetlagging1 Peyz and Viper are better let's not start spewing bs lmao
[2:40:32] Jamada: AAAA

[2:40:50] mclaren_ftw: Viper is highkey nuts
[2:40:51] JustinGBYT: @jetlagging1 SURELY COPIUM
[2:40:52] Raja888: @Raja888 I believe GIGABIN will carry when meta shifts to carry tops and weakside is nerfed
[2:40:57] ziosevielspezel: GIGABIN
[2:41:00] jetlagging1: @jetlagging1 yeah no way Uzi's current form can touch Viper either
[2:41:01] hiuregod: GIGABIN
[2:41:01] evanesco609: how score?
[2:41:04] MiinALove: I mean LPL adcs are just too cracked

[2:41:09] DevinBookerTruther: @queen_tiem agree with everyone except from LP
[2:41:10] Dextroslol: yo chill
[2:41:11] morpheusx2001: Knight just know Yagoat too well, they were childhood friends playing LOL together since day 1
[2:41:29] JustinGBYT: GIGABIN
[2:41:32] Kaatsuraa: blg wont ever win against jdg
[2:41:33] softemoBf: @evanesco609 1-0 but yes 2-0 soon
[2:41:36] hiuregod: THE CHAMPION GIGABIn
[2:41:48] flawlessrookie: @JustinGBYT the best adc in lpl is from the LCK buddy ... idk what your smoking if you think uzi will be the best in LCK
[2:41:53] h011ywood: wbg needs to put xiaohu on carries like tristana/jayce not annie or ahri
[2:41:53] morpheusx2001: I think Yagoat just have mind block when playing against Knight due to their childhood friendship
[2:41:54] kipplerFPS: @Queen_Tiem LP, Hope and Able are not better than Uzi are we just making stuff up now
[2:42:01] JustinGBYT: @flawlessrookie but is he in the lck?
[2:42:04] ziosevielspezel: everyone talks about zeus but no one talks about how clutch of a player bin is he made 3 finals in 3 international appearances and won one
[2:42:10] Queen_Tiem: I mean last year Yagao beat knight every time and this year knight beat yagao every time. Knight and yagao is the best rivalry in modern league
[2:42:19] flawlessrookie: @JustinGBYT you gonna cry now ?
[2:42:23] Sheyi_Ojo: GIGA
[2:42:24] Moobot: The host of today is Wendy (https://twitter.com/Wendy5544)!
[2:42:24] hiuregod: @Queen_Tiem Hope is pretty good tho
[2:42:24] kipplerFPS: @ziosevielspezel Everyone talks about gigabin what are u on about
[2:42:24] DevinBookerTruther: @flawlessrookie BLG 6-1 T1 and GenG  with 5 Chinese players
[2:42:30] JustinGBYT: @flawlessrookie where was ur lck finals at msi?
[2:42:37] SirGarland: Leave > Uzi veryCat
[2:42:41] hiuregod: Envyy was a top tier adc in the LCK OMEGALUL
[2:42:44] MiinALove: @ziosevielspezel no one talks about zeus after griefing 4 finals straight
[2:42:50] jetlagging1: @Queen_Tiem top 5 right now are Ruler, Elk, JKL, Light, Gala, in any order.  Uzi belongs to the group of good adcs among Able, Hope, Photic, etc
[2:42:52] Sheyi_Ojo: LCK no chinese no winning KEKW
[2:43:00] kipplerFPS: @SirGarland Unironically true though
[2:43:06] ziosevielspezel: @kipplerFPS he was underated in the western scene before msi
[2:43:13] flawlessrookie: @JustinGBYT where you lpl went at worlds KEKW
[2:43:20] MiinALove: @Queen_Tiem the first reasonable take of the day
[2:43:25] kipplerFPS: @hiuregod No he wasnt lmfao, he was mid at best and I love Envyy
[2:43:32] DevinBookerTruther: @kipplerfps Hope is playing great this split. He is better than uzi atm
[2:43:32] kazmeregames2381: Ruler is the true GOAT tho. Idc what anyone says
[2:43:42] JustinGBYT: @flawlessrookie different teams, jdg and blg own lck
[2:43:51] hiuregod: i hope they show us the GP barrel combo against G2
[2:43:52] flawlessrookie: @JustinGBYT Cope harder
[2:43:55] kipplerFPS: @ziosevielspezel Western only watchers are clueless about everyone not just bin
[2:43:55] hiuregod: that was beautiful
[2:43:56] Sheyi_Ojo: @hiuregod Envyy was like top 3 in LCK easily last split lmao
[2:43:57] JustinGBYT: ???
[2:44:01] MiinALove: but I thought Evi was the goat?
[2:44:02] digitalninja14: Idk nothing about this game how many kills kavani have in game 1 and 2 though?
[2:44:02] kipplerFPS: @kazmeregames2381 Facts
[2:44:08] tvc0101046: GIGABIN
[2:44:14] JustinGBYT: @flawlessrookie jdg beat blg like 5 times, blg one shot all of lck at msi
[2:44:15] Queen_Tiem: @jetlagging1 agreed on the top 5, tho i think ruler gala and elk are a tier above. I think uzi is fine on his comfort champs but i'd take able on samira over uzi on kaisa/vayne these days
[2:44:21] morpheusx2001: Since 2018 till today, LPL has 8 international titles (5 MSI, 3 world & Asian game 2018) vs LCK with only 2. It's only a ridicules narrative that LCK fanboys continue to say LCK > LPL when the reverse is true. When even Yagao Yagoat & Yagap Faker & Chovy you know LCK is FRAUD!
[2:44:35] kipplerFPS: @digitalninja14 Stop betting
[2:44:39] Sheyi_Ojo: STOP TALKING ABOUT LCK VS LPL PLEASE. LPL ARE DOMINATING, CRY MORE
[2:44:42] JustinGBYT: lck looked like na and eu when playing against blg
[2:44:50] ziosevielspezel: i think bin can be toplane goat if he wins worlds
[2:44:57] digitalninja14: Lmao he didn’t do good?
[2:44:57] kipplerFPS: @morpheusx2001 Seek professional help
[2:44:58] JustinGBYT: u lck fanboys are delusional
[2:44:59] mclaren_ftw: @morpheusx2001 yet you don't see chinese players in LCK but the reverse?
[2:45:00] hiuregod: 6-1 is crazy
[2:45:03] MiinALove: @digitalninja14 BASED
[2:45:04] JustinGBYT: t1 damn near lost to ns
[2:45:13] softemoBf: @morpheusx2001 ppl just dont like to watch correct gameplay. they only want slow gameplay they can follow along with
[2:45:20] morpheusx2001: 9 international titles vs 2 and who is better is no question
[2:45:21] hiuregod: even Golden Guardians was harder than Gen.G HUH
[2:45:21] Sheyi_Ojo: @morpheusx2001 Why would chinese players play for a worse region??
[2:45:22] DevinBookerTruther: Hey that's Bin aka GIGABIN aka T1 father
[2:45:49] MiinALove: GIGABIN
[2:45:49] morpheusx2001: which trolls says you live in the past but continue to say LCK is best LOL hahahahaha
[2:45:53] hiuregod: that DWG team was goated
[2:45:59] Queen_Tiem: OMG pushed BLG harder than t1 and geng combined. Stay mad lck fanboys
[2:46:00] hiuregod: one of the best ever
[2:46:03] Nitesearcher: GIGABIN
[2:46:04] kipplerFPS: GIGABIN

[2:46:20] MiinALove: @morpheusx2001 NA KEKW
[2:46:41] deedshotr69: ''I wasn't playing good at the time'' *winning 1v2 easily*
[2:46:42] mclaren_ftw: Hot take: All best teams have players from LCK
[2:46:43] Sheyi_Ojo: LCK fans coping so hard since MSI KEKW
[2:46:44] d0anta: Bin chilling and still won MSI Pog
[2:46:47] PACEFALMAU: GIGABIN SO GOOD
[2:46:50] hiuregod: Bin dunked hard afon T1 this finals
[2:46:51] toaxjdbcldnjs: I'm korean and I totally agree with the opinion, JDG, BLG, OMG and tes are better than T1 and gen. maybe also LNG
[2:46:53] Queen_Tiem: Bin's only fault as a player is that he isnt 369 KEKW
[2:46:55] Orphean: Bin is so Pog
[2:46:58] deedshotr69: @mclaren_ftw BLG
[2:47:00] MiinALove: @mclaren_ftw except BLG
[2:47:06] JustinGBYT: @toaxjdbcldnjs good take
[2:47:07] Jamada: LCK IS IN THE MUD

[2:47:35] jetlagging1: @Jamada GIGACHAD has spoken, everybody shut up
[2:47:43] morpheusx2001: @toaxjdbcldnjs shouldn't be
[2:47:52] softemoBf: once t1 goes down lck will be over tbh
[2:48:19] Sheyi_Ojo: @the_pit LCK already over lol. Have you seen them play this season?
[2:48:24] MiinALove: yeah I don't trust Gen G and KT at Internationals for one bit
[2:48:32] ziosevielspezel: LPL are so bad at bo1 but this year would be fun since you cant get eliminated without playing a single bo3 so i expect LPL teams to place higher
[2:48:33] axelan1: if LCK imported Licorice they might be competitive with LPL
[2:48:33] JustinGBYT: @the_pit they already going down, kt beat em 2-0 and even ns almsot beat them in a close 3 game series
[2:48:37] Queen_Tiem: @mclaren_ftw last year's jdg had only 1 korean player and that player never played in lck. RNG won back to back msi's with no korean players.
[2:48:40] DevinBookerTruther: @the_pit T1 is already down like a clown Charlie brown. They haven't won an international trophy since 2015
[2:48:53] Queen_Tiem: @axelan1 TRUE BASED

[2:49:24] Sheyi_Ojo: @d0anta blg, suning and?
[2:49:31] hiuregod: @d0anta RNG?
[2:49:34] MiinALove: @d0anta RNG
[2:49:42] DevinBookerTruther: Fun fact G2 has won an international event more recently than Fraud1 LUL
[2:49:43] Sheyi_Ojo: oh
[2:49:45] hiuregod: RNG unironically should've kept him
[2:49:50] Sheyi_Ojo: morning brain
[2:49:50] MiinALove: @d0anta truly a GIGACHAD
[2:50:01] jetlagging1: @DevinBookerTruther T1 has real competition this year.  There's a non-zero chance of BLG getting 2nd place in 4 tournaments
[2:50:11] ori1337690: GG
[2:50:12] MiinALove: @hiuregod well he's on a better team now so i'm happy for him
[2:50:17] softemoBf: @d0anta is khan the only other to do that?
[2:50:18] niskymen: NotLikeThis
[2:50:18] JustinGBYT: t1 needs a new midlaner, faker needs to retire or they will never win a tournament again
[2:50:19] morpheusx2001: Xiaohu the only 3 times MSI champions & do so twice consecutively with 2 different role. An achievement no players can ever get since now they have new & easier format to enter
[2:50:20] Nitesearcher: Tabe has been a real boon for BLG
[2:50:21] MiinALove: @hiuregod Rng aint it anymore
[2:50:22] toaxjdbcldnjs: @raged_l I'm real korean but rhat's fact
[2:50:28] hiuregod: @hiuregod true
[2:50:36] ziosevielspezel: @d0anta bin would be my toplane goat if he wins a world
[2:50:45] hiuregod: but like, imagine if RNG had Bin last Worlds
[2:50:47] toaxjdbcldnjs: LCK now can beat LPL, maybe except KT
[2:50:48] DevinBookerTruther: @hiuregod Bin was a BLG player on loan to RNG so they wanted him back
[2:50:53] hiuregod: he could've made a difference
[2:50:55] toaxjdbcldnjs: Can't
[2:51:08] toaxjdbcldnjs: Can't beat LPL
[2:51:11] bluesclues96: @ziosevielspezel bin and 369 would instantly be top 3 if they win worlds
[2:51:28] JustinGBYT: id take omg in a bo5 vs t1
[2:51:40] mclaren_ftw: Fofo wants to carry so bad, he needs a team to support him the way RNG did for Uzi
[2:51:53] Queen_Tiem: @hiuregod RNG all had covid for almost all of last worlds and breathe was their best performing member. I doubt bin wouldve made a difference
[2:51:58] ziosevielspezel: @bluesclues96 369 is 2semis and 1 finals right?
[2:52:03] Le_Phoenix_WinQ: bin being 20 and taking 3 teams to international finals is crazy resume true
[2:52:05] axelan1: @ziosevielspezel yeah those 2 would be top 3, with Licorice at the top
[2:52:07] bluesclues96: @ziosevielspezel i'm talking about of all time
[2:52:08] toaxjdbcldnjs: Last 5 years, worlds and MSI both be
[2:52:11] morpheusx2001: FOFO is bad I'm sorry LOL

[2:52:38] mclaren_ftw: @morpheusx2001 LUL rubbish take
[2:52:44] toaxjdbcldnjs: Lpl is better than LCK in last 5 years
[2:52:55] Orphean: goat toplaners like TheShy Kappa
[2:53:01] JustinGBYT: @toaxjdbcldnjs true
[2:53:06] MiinALove: GIGASHY
[2:53:16] bluesclues96: @ziosevielspezel he won summer 2020, MSC 2020, made it to semis in worlds 2020, won summer 2022, made it to semis worlds 2022, now he won MSI 2023
[2:53:24] morpheusx2001: @mclaren_ftw so many mid laners better than him & they way he is ruining EDG that's says a lot
[2:53:57] Queen_Tiem: @orphean i mean nobody had a peak as high as theshy since like faker in 2013. He just also had the biggest fall off of all time xdd

[2:54:12] MiinALove: @Queen_Tiem xdd
[2:54:24] morpheusx2001: 3 inters of EDG Fofo, Ale & JieJie is ruining UZI returning dream

[2:54:29] kobol76620: Kappa
[2:54:31] Orphean: xdd
[2:54:39] bluesclues96: @ziosevielspezel if either of them win worlds then they would automatically be top 3
[2:54:46] Queen_Tiem: @ziosevielspezel yeah but thats nullified if JDG manage to get a grand slam year this year
[2:55:07] raged_l: @mclaren_ftw FoFo is not bad but he is not the one that can take you to final
[2:55:15] ziosevielspezel: @bluesclues96 true it was a shame 369 had to withdraw from asian games if bin wins that it would be insane
[2:55:15] MiinALove: Any Ultra Prime believers?
[2:55:23] BigBigRu: @raged_l NODDERS mid mid
[2:55:39] Queen_Tiem: If JDG win summer and worlds they're automatically all in the GOAT conversation. No team has ever managed a grand slam and thats when winning MSI was way easier
[2:55:43] ziosevielspezel: @Queen_Tiem yes
[2:55:52] toaxjdbcldnjs: LpL is much better than LCK in fighting, and now objext controll also better than
[2:56:04] M012345678: Vibe
[2:56:05] Orphean: EDG team strat meetings be like 'hai i'm just gonna run it up the middle' and Uzi is in the corner just begging them to try not to int, just a little bit
[2:56:34] morpheusx2001: @Queen_Tiem winning MSI before wasn't easier LOL
[2:56:44] M012345678: @orphean KEKW Surely Uzi doesn't int
[2:56:45] MiinALove: @Orphean Fofo: Pick me Jayce xdd
[2:57:02] ziosevielspezel: @f0REIGNN im asying you can make an argument in toplane goat if either of the win worlds this year
[2:57:19] morpheusx2001: @Queen_Tiem to win MSI before the format changed, you have to be #1 champion for your own league then win the MSI against all others champion. So it's a lot harder
[2:57:19] 台灣的選擇一熊問安: BLG nlnlRockU nlnlRockU nlnlYes
[2:57:26] mclaren_ftw: Every toplaner ints, just the current ad meta
[2:57:31] raged_l: @ziosevielspezel what if BB win the world xdd
[2:57:31] Moobot: @Moobot This is patch 13.12! You can find the patch notes here: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-13-12-notes/
[2:57:46] Orphean: @M012345678 bruh you can't tell me Uzi inting is the reason edg is struggling rn
[2:57:46] MiinALove: @ziosevielspezel what if Heretics wins worlds? xdding
[2:57:49] Queen_Tiem: @morpheusx2001 this has to be a joke. Before you needed to win 2 bo5s to win msi. JDG had to win 4 and thats from the winners' bracket. BLG played like 7 bo5s
[2:58:04] axelan1: winning MSI before was easier, teams didn't have to play against Licorice
[2:58:15] ziosevielspezel: @raged_l @hle_clid if any western team wins they would instantly become goats in their roles KEKW
[2:58:21] M012345678: @orphean nonono, my point is that Uzi isn't innocent either
[2:58:42] mclaren_ftw: @Queen_Tiem pretty sure BLG played the max no of games a team can play in MSI and won, absolutely gigachad
[2:58:43] ziosevielspezel: @f0REIGNN where did zeus come from KEKW
[2:58:50] MiinALove: @ziosevielspezel i was about to say KEKW
[2:58:56] revenge1337tv: so what lpl has to do to be better than LCK mhm I hope when jdg win intel grand slam and get as solo 1 milion people will not consider lck as the best

[2:59:29] morpheusx2001: @Queen_Tiem the probability is harder to win since you have to be champion first to enter. But if you argue that now with 2nd seed going creating more competition then maybe. But still with loser bracket, it is easier to win if you are a good team since it gives you insurance

[3:01:03] ouioui_16: score? whos playing
[3:01:04] Queen_Tiem: @morpheusx2001 to go from 2nd seed to champion you need to win 1 additional series. The minimum amount of extra series a team needs to win in the new format is 2 more bo5s than the old format. It is by definition harder

[3:05:40] Nitesearcher: HUH
[3:05:42] Queen_Tiem: @morpheusx2001 you're acting like being 2nd place is the same as being 10th. To get 2nd place in playoffs is precisely 1 series easier than getting first place. Winning msi as a 2nd place seed after you qualify takes at least 2 more bo5s than it used to. So a team that made playoff finals in the old format needs to win 1 less series in the old format to win msi than they do in the new format if they lose their regional finals. Thats pretty fucking simple math
