[1:02:48] worserf02: Do lol teams play in different places?

[1:03:11] worserf02: Lpl*
[1:03:11] Nitesearcher: @worserf02 3 different arenas/cities today
[1:03:16] Rosharlol: @worserf02 wdym there location?
[1:03:17] hermeneutist: @worserf02 4 teams have home venues: Suzhou LNG, Xi'an WE, Shenzhen NIP, Beijing JDG -- if the bo3 does NOT involve any of these 4, it will be at Shanghai
[1:03:29] Squidd6: @worserf02 in china they do, there are like half a dozen different stadiums
[1:03:41] tiendn9999: 6.2 SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:03:42] chorizogrande1: oh Tarzan is on LNG, might end up watching then PogChamp
[1:03:46] hermeneutist: incidentally, today is 3 venue day FailFish
[1:03:52] SAVEFACE3: harder
[1:03:54] Rosharlol: yea only chinese league plays in different venues

[1:04:16] Rosharlol: tarzan Aware
[1:04:21] SAVEFACE3: duDudu
[1:04:28] Squidd6: @hermeneutist games are likely gonna be long too with these teams, if any series goes to 3 matches we will go back in jail
[1:04:32] hermeneutist: no intboy today FeelsGoodMan
[1:04:51] Nitesearcher: Did Ming choose to take time off?
[1:04:53] chorizogrande1: @squidd6 is jail just when no mods are in chat?
[1:05:20] SAVEFACE3: EZ
[1:05:24] ENHINK: Bus came late again
[1:05:28] sota_cat: This is hype game，Cuz 90% of LNG fans ask LNG to kick Tarzan and get Xiaohao instead after LNG lost to IG
[1:05:44] Squidd6: @chorizogrande1 jail is when chat is put in emote only mode, they do it when english broadcast falls behind because one of the series took too long
[1:06:27] hermeneutist: 3 venue means they will all start on time at 1500/1700/1900
[1:06:38] kitk7: the sub is better than iboy ?
[1:06:42] chorizogrande1: my b for all the questions, why would it fall behind with too many matches ?
[1:06:44] ENHINK: FallWinning AL FallWinning
[1:06:45] ftmello1: RARE x WE and TT x Invictus who win
[1:06:52] hermeneutist: so if an earlier game goes to full 3 games, it will overrun the 2 hours and overlap with next series

[1:07:52] ftmello1: RARE x WE and TT x Invictus who win
[1:07:55] hermeneutist: and there are always some annoying twitch chatters who will come in here to "spoil" the overlapping game while casters are still casting the earlier one
[1:08:00] chorizogrande1: I see
[1:08:12] hermeneutist: so chat has to switch to jail to protect from spoiler kids
[1:08:14] chorizogrande1: so the English cast is sometimes delayed from live results

[1:09:02] thepinu24: Spoiler Kids should gc
[1:09:04] riprip6: But playoff line RA is 4-8 now
[1:09:05] dirtyturtle33: @chorizogrande1 not right now, usually after game 1 as they do interviews on chinese schedule and other games play in other locations
[1:09:06] Adi12041: LNG is raged after losing 2-0 to IG they will win WORLDs now
[1:09:13] hermeneutist: altho they will skip interviews and accelerate draft to try and catch up
[1:09:22] SAVEFACE3: EZ nice suit and belt
[1:09:49] chorizogrande1: ohh I think I get it finally 😭 so there's only 1 group of English commentators so they  need to cast all matches even if they overlap

[1:10:36] chorizogrande1: thanks for the help chatters
[1:10:40] hermeneutist: ehh not really we have like 8 eng casters rotating in various pairings; but they only cast on one live channel
[1:10:44] GriefSociety: 2-0 LNG??
[1:10:44] ftmello1: I bet 30$ on AL odd 7x
[1:10:46] supermiku233: Uzi yyds

[1:11:02] Warhol90: @ftmello1 i bet 3 xD
[1:11:07] 下信: 2-0lng
[1:11:25] hermeneutist: the limiting factor is the eng production side i'd say, it's the same production team running the twitch/yt stream

[1:12:12] riprip6: 6 times points Good Luck
[1:12:17] hermeneutist: if they wanted to, i believe they COULD assign specific caster pairs for different venues; but they don't have the production to do multicast, nor the spare twitch channel with subs

Then, when he stacks Armor and MR, he gets Ability Haste too, Ability Haste to his Q, and his spell casting speeds up. Then, he has an AD ratio, so his W…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[1:51:48] shadow___i: idk why ppl think the potential 3rd and 4th seeds of LPL are mid, there's no world in which these teams won't be competitive with the teams from other regions are bringing. LCK, LCS and LEC are all looking extremely weak
[1:51:53] sephiroxical19981202: @chorizogrande1 So we will have 2 teams eliminated in groups again

[1:52:09] chorizogrande1: @sephiroxical19981202 think so yep
[1:52:15] DevinBookerTruther: TES needs replace wayward mark and Tian and they might be a top tier team again

[1:54:39] shadow___i: @DevinBookerTruther how do you know? have i missed some matches? KT looks decent on the patch but the only 'good' team they beat so far is T1 and Faker is injured

[2:03:08] santinoxGG: @DevinBookerTruther Bum he needs 5 superstars to win BigBrother
[2:03:08] Nitesearcher: @sephiroxical19981202 iirc Bengi, a coach for T1, said 2 weeks
[2:03:18] shadow___i: @DevinBookerTruther T1 is a huge team with a huge fanbase, anytime they'll do well, they'll get this kind of support. Them not living up to being the absolute best team in the world doesnt make them frauds bro. They are still very good individual players that can beat any team in the right circumstances. Like I said, overusing a word just makes it meaningless imo

[3:07:09] howlinghorsey: i'd deffo go for the support or top from WE
[3:07:22] captainkrajick: Cube is fine though, plus he can play off meta picks

[3:13:10] howlinghorsey: neeko is in lane counterable by counting. jgl just uses a range ability or smth and if the pet doesnt hop poof its a neeko
[3:13:20] hiuregod: too bad WE lost their star top laner Biubiu Kappa
[3:13:32] captainkrajick: @howlinghorsey neeko has insane lane push which means she always gets prio when she wants to

[4:53:43] captainkrajick: @001majist it's 15th vs 16th
[4:53:46] z5152459: Bro, I'm lowkey rooting for UCAL, he's the most passionate import I've seen in a while
[4:53:53] pobles_xdd: TT will expose ig frauds
[4:53:55] jetlagging1: we have an infestation
[4:54:00] hermeneutist: if yall missed any part of that hilarious segment, it's already up on lpl youtube
[4:54:07] LvothNrv: @LvothNrv <3
[4:54:14] z5152459: UCAL after beating Uzi actually hyped me out
[4:54:16] captainkrajick: @z5152459 yeah I love Ucal so much
[4:54:17] hermeneutist: 7mins just enough time to go find it and watch
[4:54:20] z5152459: up*
[4:54:34] 001majist: @captainkrajick  TT sometimes chokea at mid to late start strong then flop
[4:54:56] pobles_xdd: I bet money on tt vs edg, best choise ive ever made
[4:55:05] 001majist: Ig is overrated i think 🤔
[4:55:08] z5152459: Still, wasn't TT stronger with Huanfeng? lol I feel bad for him.
[4:55:08] sephiroxical19981202: Hoya to LCS next year
[4:55:14] cw1123: Ok, change support
[4:55:26] chrisrox22: TT last match was very entertaining
[4:55:34] z5152459: @001majist IG is 16th place, how are they overrated lol. They're like complertely hopeless
[4:55:34] Moobot: All info of the LPL 2023 Summer Schedule can be found here: https://lolesports.com/schedule?leagues=lpl
[4:55:45] captainkrajick: @001majist They changed adc midway through and had some issues with team macro because of it. It's a roster that will work long term i hope
[4:56:13] captainkrajick: @001majist Also HOYA underperformed this split compared to last.
[4:56:14] 001majist: @z5152459 my bad i mean they got a lot of fans
[4:56:18] Naaqba: !patch
[4:56:18] Moobot: @Naaqba @Naaqba This is patch 13.12! You can find the patch notes here: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-13-12-notes/
[4:56:23] z5152459: @001majist It's definitely a long term project to develop 1xn, but they're wasting UCAL and HOYA's prime as a result
[4:56:34] jetlagging1: UP signed Dream this late into the season with no hope of making playoffs anyway
[4:56:42] captainkrajick: @001majist @z5152459 Well Ucal's prime is 5 years ago now Aware
[4:56:48] z5152459: @001majist IG had a strong spring split start, can't blame fans for being happy XD
[4:56:49] R1PP3RZx: Tt winning?
[4:56:51] 001majist: @captainkrajick yeah thats facts
[4:57:18] pociteh: Ig 2-1
[4:57:23] z5152459: @001majist True, but he's not bad enough to retire yet. He's at YAGAO's stage rightb now
[4:57:23] captainkrajick: if TT can change something they will be deadly next year when there's 3 events
[4:57:42] captainkrajick: next year 3 events is gonna be hell for LPL team schedule
[4:57:48] 001majist: @captainkrajick last time ucal saved them from edg but dang its like uzi+4 monkeys that time
[4:57:57] z5152459: I hope the 3 internationals won't turn LPL into best of 1 region. Cause best of 3s are so much better
[4:57:59] 001majist: @z5152459 facts
[4:58:24] captainkrajick: @z5152459 they are never gonna do that. I think they might go back to the old format of 2, 8 team groups
[4:58:35] 001majist: @captainkrajick or before November i guess haha
[4:58:38] z5152459: Right
[4:58:39] sammuxx: Need tt win to feed my children Prayge
[4:58:39] BORED2212: When the bad LPL teams win they actually look very good but when bad lec or lcs teams wins it still looks bad
[4:58:58] z5152459: True again lol
[4:59:02] jetlagging1: @z5152459 the 3rd event is almost going to be a pre-season event like valorant
[4:59:25] captainkrajick: @z5152459 @jetlagging1 I don't think so. I think it's more like 2 Masters into 1 Champions
[4:59:27] legend_0019: @sammuxx good luck...
[4:59:28] z5152459: MAybe like the period around Weibo Cup etc?
[4:59:53] captainkrajick: @z5152459 no, it's gonna be around April
[4:59:54] z5152459: gotta take a dump before the game
[5:00:00] captainkrajick: @z5152459 o7 good luck
[5:00:08] jetlagging1: @z5152459 how can you be so sure?  the timing just doesn't work otherwise.
[5:00:23] BORED2212: @z5152459 dow push too hard like gilius
[5:00:23] captainkrajick: @z5152459 @jetlagging1 They're moving things around. It's gonna follow current LEC schedule
[5:00:51] jetlagging1: @z5152459 I hope not.  LEC schedule sucks.
[5:00:51] Moobot: The casters of today are Hysterics (https://twitter.com/HystericsCasts) and Nymaera (https://twitter.com/Nymaera), Munchables (https://twitter.com/HeyMunchables) and Kitty (https://twitter.com/kiittwy)!
[5:01:06] captainkrajick: @z5152459 Also China and Korea are playing 3 international tournaments this year anyways
[5:01:11] captainkrajick: @z5152459 because of Asian Games
[5:01:21] captainkrajick: @z5152459 Japan and PCS too
[5:01:21] 001majist: I hope to watch a top tier match... Good luck to both teams
[5:01:24] jetlagging1: @z5152459 LEC don't have the guts to go full bo3 and do this half-ass stuff
[5:01:27] BORED2212: @jetlagging1 it will still be bo3 just with 3 splits like lec
[5:01:54] captainkrajick: Yeah LPL will be Bo3 whole split into playoffs, but maybe we will have 2 groups of 8/9 teams
[5:02:03] captainkrajick: that's the only way I can think of it happening
[5:02:22] captainkrajick: unless it's the current intense schedule the whole year round
[5:02:37] sammuxx: @jetlagging1 they dont want to do full week broadcasts so that is sadly why
[5:02:42] 001majist: Other's are here because of athena 🤣
[5:02:46] jetlagging1: i guess they could use the LDL format, but it's less hype
[5:03:29] sammuxx: Im here because of my crippling league of legends + gambling addiction combo
[5:03:43] captainkrajick: @jetlagging1 relegation would be hype tbh, but I don't think they'd add it
[5:03:53] 001majist: @sammuxx ig or TT?
[5:04:08] hiuregod: UP signed Dream btw
[5:04:12] captaincook1497: EZ 4 IG
[5:04:25] sammuxx: TT
[5:04:39] jetlagging1: @jetlagging1 it's not true relegation, just having the better teams play each other.
[5:04:50] 001majist: Its good to gamble in esports it's like you can feel every single comebacks and kills @sammuxx
[5:04:55] captainkrajick: @jetlagging1 It is basically relegation just 2 tiers
[5:05:05] jetlagging1: anyone 3 internationals is just another attempt to get people in NA to watch league.  LPL LCK is fine as is
[5:05:16] 001majist: I mean gambling is bad but the tension is real
[5:05:33] captaincook1497: @001majist and feel each dollar you lose too NotLikeThis
[5:05:42] captainkrajick: @jetlagging1 Nah I want more international tournaments. I would prefer if they had more regional events. Like only Asia, or only Americas+EU
[5:05:47] pobles_xdd: I lost everything on lfl yesterday, if TT win this i win it back
[5:05:54] sammuxx: Yeah brings more hype to meanless games when Im only fan of blg from lpl rly
[5:05:54] 001majist: @sammuxx goodluck to you sir dont jinx it 🤣
[5:06:10] 001majist: @captaincook1497 facts hahahahaha
[5:06:13] captainkrajick: @jetlagging1 so like 5 NA 5 EU and some wild care teams, some fun formats
[5:06:46] jetlagging1: @jetlagging1 if the 3rd international is regional only i am on board.  otherwise it's just a lower level tournament than regular season
[5:06:46] Moobot: The host of today is Wendy (https://twitter.com/Wendy5544)!

[5:07:01] captainkrajick: @jetlagging1 Yeah I wouldn't mind the 3rd tournament being regional
[5:07:08] 001majist: @captaincook1497 but its good rather than playing slots
[5:07:26] captainkrajick: @jetlagging1 but some teams might not play well because they don't think it's important
[5:07:31] jetlagging1: i don't want to have to watch more shitty lcs teams instead of regular lpl matches
[5:07:56] eternity1110: !caster

[5:09:50] BigCAPPE: @tmihee yep
[5:09:55] captainkrajick: @jetlagging1 being forced to play against better teams will always improve worse teams over time

[6:40:34] fox12397: ucal dps chnyWow
[6:40:38] rinbunbun: @runthehomeless the thing is LNG is inconsistent coin flips if they play to their level sure

[6:43:11] RunTheHomeless: @rinbunbun For sure, I would feel much better sending them to worlds than TES right now. They just gotta gel and Tarzan gotta get back on form and it's gonna be a great team again

[6:47:47] currychicken9000: @z5152459  TES goes for big names . I doubt TES thinks Ucal is the on the same level as Rookie,  more likely they'll go for someone like Dionb/Scout
[6:47:47] sephiroxical19981202: @z5152459 IG needs a new team lol
[6:47:53] Ghost_Spider_Gwen: plank
[6:47:53] jetlagging1: IG first needs a new owner who is willing to spend money
[6:48:07] rinbunbun: @runthehomeless Thing is Tarzan in playoffs and worlds are kinda invisible that's why Tarzan has been criticized lately by the CN fans ResidentSleeper
[6:48:16] mainanalyst: its crazy how teams win worlds then lose their rosters
[6:48:25] z5152459: @z5152459 I don't think Doinb after resting for a year still has that much value. Also, UCAL still looks good in all these losses

[6:49:19] hiuregod: @mainanalyst FPX maintained theirs for a great while
[6:49:24] z5152459: Speaking of which, is EDG switching in Fisher anytime soon? He's cracked right?
[6:49:29] hiuregod: just changed the top
[6:49:51] SirGarland: TES vs OMG GIGACHAD
[6:49:56] Ghost_Spider_Gwen: meow GuitarTime
[6:49:59] RunTheHomeless: @rinbunbun Yeah that's fair, but I also think the jungler pool globally is pretty bad rn. If top LCK junglers are Cuzz, no hands Peanut and Oner in his slump right now, and LPL has Kanavi, Xun and then pretty far down to Tarzan, Heng & Weiwei
[6:50:28] z5152459: @hiuregod FPX looks like they're growing though. They alongside LGD actually seem strong
[6:50:33] hiuregod: TES needs Meteor and Ming

[6:51:09] Ghost_Spider_Gwen: 2-0? Is this LCK?
[6:51:32] hiuregod: @z5152459 FPX just needs a better top and jg and they're making playoffs

[6:51:55] rinbunbun: @runthehomeless tbh Tarzan and scout were the best mid jgl duo in spring regular season if they can replicate it somehow again with this current LNG they are contenders

[6:52:23] jetlagging1: @rinbunbun There's still Wei and Xiaohao

[6:53:01] z5152459: @z5152459 Tian legit looks good in regular season though. His ints aren't as often as people claim.
[6:53:02] fox12397: edg chnyWow
