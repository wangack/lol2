[2:37:15] luuuke07: make it 1-1 üò≠
[2:37:21] ervangrimaldy: @captainkrajick but, they did OMG win 7 matches streak, they did losestreak bruh, last match OMG defeated by TT

[2:39:02] ye1l: @hiuregod difference is if JKL plays well u could put him on LGD and LGD is better than LNG. LNG no matter if everyone is on form has a weak early game, they can't even convincingly beat LGD early
[2:39:12] nhang14: 13.12 Aware
[2:39:14] platyporo: should have bet more on LNG
[2:39:15] idiedfromcringe: @BORED2212 1-0
[2:39:16] yeezyfann: Honestly every LPL game looks so scripted. Like they arent even playing a real game. Feels kinda shitty to watch
[2:39:34] ye1l: I want teams that have players with high ceilings to go to worlds, not a team like LNG that just has a good floor level
[2:39:34] Fil_maj_rasz: can u stop talking like... longer than games?
[2:39:35] BORED2212: @idiedfromcringe ty
[2:39:43] captainkrajick: @yeezyfann what does this mean

[2:39:50] nhang14: @yeezyfann Buzz off lil bro
[2:39:51] platyporo: @yeezyfann you havnt watched LCK before?
[2:39:56] why_fayiah: @yeezyfann yeah. some series just feel bizarre. playoffs usually good tho
[2:39:57] ye1l: High ceiling teams can win vs the best if the stars align, LNG isn't beating anyone
[2:40:10] ssweetsorrow: lol lng was just playing with their food earlier, y'all are freakin doubters üòÇ
[2:40:14] captainkrajick: @Fil_maj_rasz yeha bro why don't you press the start button Hmm
[2:40:19] Nitesearcher: @captainkrajick Sounds like a detractor with no logical reasoning to me
[2:40:23] OGBryan0202: @yeezyfann the players are actually all very good, prolly boils down to team synergy during games. thats why you can see low standing teams winning teams of higher standings
[2:40:32] smokehardbody: Stop talking get onto the game
[2:40:34] hiuregod: @ye1l TES' early game isn't that great either imo, and Tian is too coinflippy for me to consider them better
[2:40:38] bluesclues96: @centwr they were not lol, meteor made the game 10x harder for LNG
[2:40:46] idiedfromcringe: AYAYA
[2:40:48] ye1l: U take the team that win worlds 1/5 times or whatever and int in groups 4/5 times over the team that loses in quarters every time
[2:40:51] chanseven77: CaitlynS CaitlynS CaitlynS
[2:40:52] ervangrimaldy: @captainkrajick back again all decisions are in coach
[2:40:53] rinbunbun: LNG is more like a LCK team LUL
[2:40:55] captainkrajick: @nuxxzz yeah China League made Korean teams matchfix all international events
[2:41:06] captainkrajick: @ervangrimaldy No? The players are the ones at the keyboard
[2:41:09] jyotinegi: 4Head
[2:41:15] terta79: Tes fangirls still delusional? 4Head
[2:41:27] hiuregod: TES with Meteor and Ming would be hype, with this current line i can't hype them sorry
[2:41:32] yeezyfann: @platyporo lck is so good man. I feel like LPL is ruined by gambling controlling everything in the match (first blood, over/under kills, towers, EVERYTHING is part of the SCRIPT) BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:41:34] alexjonesfrogay: @yeezyfann by scripted u mean competitive right? or do u prefer the "sit and do nothing and lose" strat by lck?

[2:43:19] yeezyfann: @captainkrajick at least they have good mechanics in LCK. Last game was the most pathetic game ive ever seen. (Lgd vs lng)

[2:44:36] ervangrimaldy: @captainkrajick yes, but what determines the draft and composition of the champion is the big part of the coach
[2:44:45] nhang14: @yeezyfann Lck mechanic KEKW like keria rakan flash combo in a bush? Against JDG?
[2:44:48] mrswaggyy: THE HOUSE ON LNG
[2:44:51] jeffreygarciam24: 2-1 lgd won
[2:44:57] alexjonesfrogay: @Sylvanas_Windrunner1 he just woke up from watching lck
[2:45:07] captainkrajick: @ervangrimaldy yeah, and they got figured out in draft by TES the day prior. You are asking them to change their draft completely in less than 20 hours and practice it
[2:45:09] ye1l: Eitherway I will ALWAYS prefer the team with high ceiling over the team with a high floor, no discussion to be had

[2:45:26] diversity06: @mrswaggyy what are the odds of LNG win?
[2:45:37] jetlagging1: @Sylvanas_Windrunner1 because it's an obvious troll who started following a day ago.
[2:45:38] yeezyfann: @captainkrajick i wont even say anything more because lck is obviously so much better and the games are not FAKE AND SCRIPTED. not even worth arguing. Its so obvious
[2:45:40] blahf0ol: OBVIOUS TO SEE WHO ACTUALLY TUNES IN, JUST LOOK AT THE LGD BETTORS LUL LUL LUL

[2:46:19] hiuregod: @zduke__ yes, i've been wanting TES Meteor for the entire split at this point bruh, Tian can just single handedly lose a game
[2:46:23] BORED2212: @ye1l sure but a team with a high floor can also have a high ceiling
[2:46:24] RunTheHomeless: @yeezyfann This guy doesn't watch LPL but apparently knows all the intricacies of the game. How come LPL has won 4/5 international tournaments if LCK is so much better and not scripted?

[2:49:21] captainkrajick: Views by what metrics? You are aware that the viewership in China is the largest by a mile right? Meanwhile LCK has invested in a better production product for a while which attracted a lot of fans. You also still didn't adress the point that if the League is scripted, then how come LCK doesn't win everything by default and got emberassed by "the worst LPL 2nd seed ever" at MSI?

[2:56:14] qbooster1199: @captainkrajick personally I think winning worlds matters less in this game then say nba cause worlds is played on one patch
[2:56:26] goofie13: jinjao can flash hook away

[2:57:44] captainkrajick: @umnica_dota2 You know there are more than 1 stadiums in LPL and only 1 english stream
[2:57:47] fast_turtle15: @umnica_dota2 tbh not having they're viewers spoiled by cringe chatters show they care :D
[2:57:51] MultiMiiix: Jinjiao's agent must be good that he is still in LPL
[2:57:52] Luffy10941: LGD KEKW
[2:58:03] fast_turtle15: their*
[2:58:04] qbooster1199: @blackbeam i think 1 more from rookie or xiaohu is enough
[2:58:06] RunTheHomeless: @qbooster1199 I think you can still argue for Rookie, Faker hasn't been a carry like Rookie for several years now
[2:58:09] endevour2022: LGD BETTOR GO SLEEP
[2:58:17] myoui_mina_24: Meteor farmer kekw

[2:58:33] captainkrajick: @hiuregod well uhh Flandre is kinda Hmm
[2:58:45] 7rain__: Kim Min Jae Bayern Pog
[2:58:49] qbooster1199: @RunTheHomeless the main argument against faker is that his dominant years were during a much less competitive era
[2:58:56] 7rain__: Lee Kang In PSG Pog
[2:58:56] Erdiul: @qbooster1199 Rookie ain'
[2:58:57] nhang14: @hiuregod Flandre injury though Sadge
[2:58:59] greta1500: scouts flash?
[2:59:00] blackbeam: @qbooster1199 hard to say imo, i am personally a huge rookie enjoyer but i find it hard to chip at faker's legacy even with hypotheticals, when it happens i think it'll be clear whether or not its the case haha
[2:59:04] qbooster1199: Not just that rookie has more longevity
[2:59:05] captainkrajick: @qbooster1199 yeah but the argument is that Faker innovated the game
[2:59:07] umnica_dota2: @captainkrajick Why do we have to choose between these two? It's not ok to be late to broadcast every third match in a league established for sth like 10 years now
[2:59:08] 7rain__: SON TOTTENHAM KEKW
[2:59:09] Lawltree66: @RunTheHomeless Well Michael Jordan played on the Wizards late in his career. He never stopped being the Goat.

[2:59:32] RunTheHomeless: @qbooster1199 For sure, and that is also a very legit argument. I still think Faker is the goat, but there is definitely a conversation
[2:59:34] qbooster1199: @captainkrajick The game was also a lot less polished back then
[2:59:35] Luffy10941: LUL LUL LUL
[2:59:36] captainkrajick: @captainkrajick @umnica_dota2 how do you want to show every game on stream when there's 2 games playing at the same time
[2:59:36] 7rain__: Messi = DRUG KEKW Ronaldo = Pog
[2:59:37] donuts420glazeit: ppl think Faker did everything on T1 LULW its hilarious
[2:59:39] OGBryan0202: @qbooster1199 it was very competitive in korea though, many good teams and good players some probably better than him

[3:00:16] Scathighs: Poby > Faker
[3:00:18] captainkrajick: @captainkrajick also English cast is 0.2-0.5% of LPL viewership so you don't have budget for more
