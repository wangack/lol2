[3:51:47] dejvsterlul: @jaeblood They play in different parts of the country with different timezones etc so they start concurrently, and the English LPL doesn't have the resources to have 2 streams at the same time. It sucks but it is what it is
[3:51:54] Jesper6739: "slightly delayed"
[3:52:00] chebrolu52: But won't telecasting sponsors loose money due to simulatenous games
[3:52:08] jaeblood: @Nitesearcher yeh it makes sense if its in another location then they start at a set time, but then a simple solution willl be to have a B stream but they dont lol, so they know the later games start earlier as the current earlier game is ongoing but chooses not to fic it lol
