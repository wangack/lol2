[2:16:00] jmakax: Agaain?
[2:16:03] richtomato: yup
[2:16:03] Scoople: No remake should be needed, Naut hooked Kaisa outside of tower range and never hit her afterwards, so the tower never aggro'd Naut. Intended interaction.
[2:16:16] dirtykurtym: pause will be for nothing, go back and watch the vod - Naut timed the hook perfectly during beginning tower shot. He then STOPPED his AA to not grab aggro

[5:14:47] booooosss1: ofc
[5:14:53] pociteh: @megumi2212 nah. If they give al 10 odds means TES got less than 1.10 odds. Usually the difference could reach 200% from the favourite team
[5:15:13] n1kkochu: If you bet on them pre match it was like 1.2 only lol. And 3.65 for AL

[5:21:50] monado550: @richtomato betting on 1.08 is... bruh, ok its safe but i wouldnt. I put hdg 2-0 and gen g 2-0, makes around 1.6, and i repeat bet
[5:21:59] blacksheep0901: bet on AL then also bet on TES when the odds go up teamliquidBluedab
[5:22:04] shopeeestronklol: @pociteh true, like if the odds are X5 pre-game then bettors flooded that, bookies would lower the odds or even lock it
[5:22:10] chingandchop: AL wins this round
[5:22:18] kevinsai12: Had infernal soul, 8 k gold lead. Yet they lost. What a sht team AL
[5:22:20] richtomato: @monado550 that's a smart bet

[6:09:41] quackerquack123: @z5152459 SKT used to be the best team before china started having really strong rosters. This was mostly due to China getting access to league a fair bit later than KR and League taking a bit more time to catch on in china than KR
[6:10:10] Latavius_murray: next match gonna be a banger
