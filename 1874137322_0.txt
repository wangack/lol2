[6:45:20] Tarinoitsija: lpl wedding
[6:45:26] angelrawr1: Creme Stare
[6:45:28] hermeneutist: i'd say zdz probably practiced this fiora specifically to challenge ksante
[6:45:29] Oothwophen: @wavyboycheeze mayb Xiaohao is tru gigachad
[6:45:39] ye1l: Zdz is better than hoya/fearness/xlh/wayward, at best same tier as cube
[6:46:01] KentauRIJ: Vibe Vibe Vibe Vibe Vibe
[6:46:09] hermeneutist: cube tier would be mid tier imo
[6:46:24] ye1l: hery/invincible/yskm/xiaoxu are def better than zdz simply by the fact that they're better on more champs
[6:46:31] bbdos: ty wendy <3
[6:46:32] doesnothavshinshin: WENDY <3 WENDY <3 WENDY <3 WENDY <3 WENDY <3
[6:46:40] angelrawr1: TY Wendy AYAYA Clap
[6:46:41] edededdy1: Ty wendy <3
[6:46:56] hermeneutist: xiaoxu i'd say is above mid tier, but i'm biased cos he's new and has been improving in consecutive splits
[6:47:22] hermeneutist: yskm is probably similar to xiaoxu; but i think he's another bin-wannabe with very bad champ pool

[6:47:47] Luffy10941: 200 years KEKW
[6:48:02] hermeneutist: zdz should be able to handle both of these upstarts as long as he isn't hard counterpicked
[6:48:09] ye1l: Zika is silently the best player on LNG this split but people are way too biased in favor of scout to ever admit that
[6:48:20] bbdos: LPL PLAYOFFS LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[6:48:24] ye1l: and Zika's bad spring playoffs are making people hate on him too
[6:48:39] midoggi: AND I HATE RATS
[6:48:43] Improbablyalive: xdd
[6:48:46] doesnothavshinshin: regular speedruns Pog
[6:48:48] morpheusx2001: @ye1l definitely a lot of bias towards scout
[6:48:59] currychicken9000: @hermeneutist YSKM wouldn't fit  in most team better than IG , while Xiaoxu will slot into a better team nicely
[6:49:02] hermeneutist: nah zika still looks extremely disconnected from his team during fights
[6:49:05] Tarinoitsija: well the plays happen mid so mid is most likely mvp
[6:49:33] ye1l: @hermeneutist He's still the only player on the team consistently finding his own leads/advantages
[6:49:33] Moobot: All info of the LPL 2023 Summer Schedule can be found here: https://lolesports.com/schedule?leagues=lpl
[6:49:46] hermeneutist: zika's had maybe a handful of decent fights when he's on gwen or recently when he seems to have picked up ksante properly
[6:50:06] hermeneutist: @hermeneutist are you sure he "consistently" finds leads
[6:50:32] hermeneutist: i'd say he's been overlooked in draft maybe, and definitely ignored by tarzan
[6:51:17] ye1l: the majority of games he's setting himself up to be in good positions in teamfight phase through his laning, when actually given champions like jax/gwen/renek he's almost always winning lane in isolation
[6:52:01] midoggi: essaying
[6:52:42] Len_xyz: That was AL 2-0 for a sec
[6:53:17] idiedfromcringe: essaying

[6:53:47] andy09999999: Monkaw
[6:54:11] morpheusx2001: If WE was in LCS or LEC they would be champion there xD
[6:54:11] currychicken9000: suprise, OMG wins the split
[6:54:13] Jecikalba: axeumSip
[6:54:20] rinbunbun: Some teams will upset them LUL
[6:54:30] rinbunbun: I won't be surprised
[6:54:45] Misfur: question how long do you have to watch until you get rewards for watching games?
[6:55:07] morpheusx2001: LOL EDG probably lost it on purpose since that would be a better playoff draw
[6:55:11] fcloud: "all time stated is..." WHAT? zomg
[6:55:24] lolsunflower: what patch is lpl on right now?
[6:55:33] santinoxGG: Chris Breezy
[6:55:33] Odeos12: i prefer WBG in world for rookie
[6:55:38] Odeos12: xiaohu*
[6:55:47] ye1l: @Odeos12 xiaohu at worlds PepeLaugh
[6:55:53] morpheusx2001: imagine RNG go higher but ended up facing WGB, LNG, and then JDG xD
[6:55:59] idiedfromcringe: o7
[6:55:59] andy09999999: Bye
[6:56:04] LeonaraMoonside: later chat myunYawn myunYawn
[6:56:23] ye1l: RNG would've been actually good this split if they had like cryin/gala/ming, but no money
[6:56:27] midoggi: 3 MORE DAYS
[6:56:29] ye1l: breathe and wei has super good form lately
[6:56:33] santinoxGG: GIGACHAD Oisin
[6:56:44] currychicken9000: B05s sometimes exposed weakness that's is rarely noticed in BO3s
[6:56:44] Moobot: @Moobot This is patch 13.12! You can find the patch notes here: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-13-12-notes/

[6:58:10] jessicajanesyd: LEC TIME GIGACHAD
[6:58:21] santinoxGG: NIP doesnt belong there BigBrother BigBrother
[6:58:42] andy09999999: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[6:58:43] currychicken9000: BLG and JDG more more or less locked for worlds, the other 2 spots is up for grabs  for anyone who get past round 1
