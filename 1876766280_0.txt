[0:46:43] nassbass: @DevinBookerTruther sure but what I said was relevant
[0:46:50] morpheusx2001: UZI can only do so much as adc
[0:47:15] nassbass: did they get new songs for playoffs?
[0:48:25] shiny_chocobo: Think so YeH
[0:48:48] morpheusx2001: watch again those clowns won't start fight till UZI GIGACHAD go, and then JieJie will KS UZI. FOFO will stay behind only use ult for defending his life, wait till UZI 1v5 die & then he will try to ks or run then die
[0:48:57] nassbass: ye none seem familiar
[0:49:24] teaadng2k: Ale inting Aware

[0:50:45] teaadng2k: BO5
[0:50:59] Benantao: uzi is unskilled
[0:51:09] morpheusx2001: EDG problem is they don't initiate & let UZI clean up, they expect UZI to initiate LOL what a joke of MID lane then TOP inter
[0:51:11] Kaatsuraa: uzi is not unskilled
[0:51:33] Benantao: @morpheusx2001 uzi is not syncing wuth his team
[0:51:45] CJholder99: DinoDance
[0:51:53] Kaatsuraa: uzi is syncing with the team, but the team is not syncing with him
[0:51:53] shiny_chocobo: monkaW
[0:52:02] Benantao: @morpheusx2001 bad movement makes uzi alway at a bad position when team wants to engage
[0:52:06] morpheusx2001: @Benantao LOL the team is a disaster especially mid
[0:52:10] M012345678: DinoDance
[0:52:18] Benantao: @Kaatsuraa nope uzi is washed up a shadow of his past
[0:52:22] nassbass: monkeyJAM
[0:52:31] myprecioussosnowy: WE odds gonna be insane because of all the diehard uzi and edg fans
[0:52:31] Moobot: @Moobot This is patch 13.13! You can find the patch notes here: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-13-13-notes/
[0:52:35] morpheusx2001: @Benantao LOL because EDG mid always hide behind adc LOL
[0:52:36] teaadng2k: DinoDance
[0:53:14] Benantao: @morpheusx2001 see team like thc  new adc an everythings better with a bad adc they were exactly like edg
[0:53:32] morpheusx2001: @myprecioussosnowy teamwork WE is definitely better than EDG but I'm here for UZI and a bit for MEIKO
[0:54:11] nassbass: Heng and Hope carry Prayge
[0:54:16] devolve11: Meiko is having very bad split he has 154 deaths the most out of every LPL player. Uzi having decent split but he only looks good in old champs, bad at aphelios
[0:54:17] Benantao: look how viper plays... just admit it uzi is washed up
[0:54:17] Moobot: Catch all the LPL highlights on our Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/lpl.official/
[0:54:18] morpheusx2001: Hopefully next split EDG boss will recruit mid/top & play around UZI
[0:54:52] morpheusx2001: @Benantao you are washed up xD look at how Viper is now, without MEIKO he sucks xD
[0:55:04] Kaatsuraa: @Benantao viper is obviously better but uzi is still good
[0:55:05] Benantao: @morpheusx2001 if they do so they will fight for last position./// uzi is no bin
[0:55:06] Zaamex: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[0:55:11] nassbass: @Benantao he was better before, but calling him washed feels wrong when he's still among the better adc's
[0:55:20] morpheusx2001: Mid lane is so important. Good mid wins game
[0:55:31] morpheusx2001: bad mid lane who game collapse
[0:55:43] morpheusx2001: whole game*
[0:56:12] Benantao: mid sync is only with jungle  mid doesnt make much effecrt on the adc.. infasct its the adcs skill wehich affects theuit game the most]
[0:56:19] morpheusx2001: @morpheusx2001 LOL are you really comparing top with adc role?

[0:57:10] bolyvfr: Do you believe in uzi?
[0:57:11] Benantao: @morpheusx2001 im saying you can make a team revolving around bin,,,, but a team revolving around uzi means fighting to be worst team of the season]
[0:57:24] Kaatsuraa: peepoHey
[0:57:24] morpheusx2001: @teaadng2k OMG is definitely fun to see in team fight but I worry of them during lane phrase...
