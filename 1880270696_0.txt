[3:59:39] Moobot: @Moobot This is patch 13.13! You can find the patch notes here: https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-13-13-notes/
[3:59:45] raged_l: @Wombattrain Dad joke KEKW
[3:59:56] DevinBookerTruther: @wombattrain jazz or Celtics ofc Keepo
[4:00:00] liandrex84: How won?
[4:00:11] xg32: theres no way rumble more important than lb this series KEKW
[4:00:11] Macielzeraa_: 2x1 or 3x1 now guys? i was making one coffee
[4:00:15] tomat3nsala7: @idiedfromcringe I am sure you live up to your name LUL
[4:00:15] piisequalto4: Hi, chat. what's the score now
[4:00:15] morpheusx2001: @morpheusx2001 I want to see UZI at world tho... but probably LNG/WBG would
[4:00:17] Hei_Bk201___: commander mark is op
[4:00:21] teaadng2k: @piisequalto4 2-1 tes
[4:00:22] ye1l: @AnyWeebs aside from BLG/JDG only WBG/TES has the ceiling to do anything, JKL and Rookie on a good day can beat anyone, WBG if they're born to win can beat anyone, EDG/LNG loses in quarters 100/100 times
[4:00:26] bze_raven: When Chovy playing?
[4:00:31] NotBraveSphinx: Start the game veryCat T1 will smash those team at worlds anyway
[4:00:34] idiedfromcringe: @tomat3nsala7 i am sure some people are better off Shush
[4:00:37] myprecioussosnowy: @xg32 I doubt neither top can play rumble tbh xdd
[4:00:42] hiuregod: @bjartscales i remember Chovy carrying the entirety of DRX against Gen G in 2020, i actually felt bad for Bdd
[4:00:45] 兩津巡查長: 3:1 EZ
[4:00:46] bbdos: @bze_raven after this gamer
[4:00:51] Martin527: get mark off naut and rookie on LB EDG winable
[4:00:51] Macielzeraa_: @teaadng2k ty for answer
[4:01:03] ye1l: I take TES/WBG who might int in groups but might also beat geng in quarters over LNG/EDG who gets out of groups but instaloses in quarters to KT/GEN etc
[4:01:09] myprecioussosnowy: @idiedfromcringe I agree with you but still DIESOFCRINGE
[4:01:15] tomat3nsala7: @idiedfromcringe if only you were talking about yourself
[4:01:21] bjartscales: @hiuregod yeah, chovy is like 40:20 against bdd
[4:01:22] めこち: ale cool
[4:01:24] 普拿疼蛋黃酥: What now
[4:01:26] yuri0tv: @honda_nsx_gt perfect
[4:01:27] morpheusx2001: @AnyWeebs for a good team one or 2 great players aint enough. You look for weak links both TES (JG/TOP), EDG (TOP/MID) are weak links
[4:01:27] brownboyadi: Leave Leblanc for rookie
[4:01:29] idiedfromcringe: Belele Belele Belele
[4:01:40] DevinBookerTruther: @ye1l Weibo the type of team to drop games to minor regions and NA
[4:01:41] teaadng2k: Leblanc ban inc
[4:01:47] xg32: if fofo picks lb rookie's just gonna go jayce

[4:02:05] morpheusx2001: Still playing that stupid jayce LOL
[4:02:12] ye1l: @DevinBookerTruther but also the type of team to beat JDG evidently. I'd rather have that than a team that can't win vs any top team
[4:02:12] bze_raven: Guys is Clid returning to LPL? Seems like he would fit in comfortably there
[4:02:14] raged_l: Mods Pog

[5:40:30] AirAerenor: @HowTooMorg If you're incapable of viewing damage charts/KDA spreads from last game as proof that his teammates were bad, that's your illiteracy
[5:40:40] HowTooMorg: @airaerenor yes and Uzi isn't the best player in lpl anymore

[5:45:30] HowTooMorg: @airaerenor numbers don't mean much lmao
[5:45:32] AirAerenor: Compare games where Uzi lost to games where other ADC's lost by a similar margin. Uzi's numbers shatter theirs. CS/DPM/Participation%
[5:45:50] AirAerenor: @HowTooMorg Literal idiot degeneracy then, what, you're going to just argue your anecdotal evidence is more important?

[5:47:29] AirAerenor: If you're unfamiliar with stat based analysis, how are you going to comment on the viability of a player? What metrics are you using to judge their worth? Your own ideas?
[5:47:45] HowTooMorg: When you look at stats you have to compare what champs on are both teams whoes playing the champs and so on
[5:47:52] Kell_Z: ZAZAPlace
