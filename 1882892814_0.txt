[4:07:24] ye1l: @nassbass ruler is simply a low dmg% player accept it lol, he goes for the guaranteed damage whenever he has great setup rather than elk/jkl who goes for their own plays and tries to maximize damage. Ruler has the same illness as rekkles. Great player on a winning team, bad player on a losing team
