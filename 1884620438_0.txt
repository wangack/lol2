[1:45:11] bee_ryl: Predictions,??????
[1:45:17] rohiln: Scout is so insane holy
[1:45:20] karrzell: btw that gwen level 1 blue buff invade was first done by theshy when gwens level 1 was actually strong enough to 1v2 and reset the camp but now you can only do it on olaf and its not that crucial since level 3 dive bot isnt a given after durability patch
