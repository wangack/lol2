[1:10:19] Galoari: in toronto the biggest threats are distracted (& unskilled) drivers and suicides , most insects are dead and the ones that are alive dont rly carry anything - eventually ull get the random skunk or fox, once or twice ull see an eagle get trapped for a few days, that's it :p

[1:17:21] Eburi87: He only lockdown is her ult, and while she has sustain she lacks peel for you, so it's not as good a combo as others

[1:19:29] Velxir: !dokapon
[1:19:29] itmeBOT: JP is playing Dokapon Kingdom: Connect with @Strippin @Gmart and @Boon ! It's a multiplayer RPG/party game. Think Mario Party without minigames but with RPG leveling and gear. Players can also PvP and take away each others' money, equipment, and even hairstyles and names. The win objective is most money, after a long campaign of ~25 hrs.
[1:19:52] GraveSalad: I know this was discussed long ago but I'm lazy so I'll just ask again, is it purely due to JP's connections being LoL orientated or was there something specific about LoL he liked better than Dota2?
[1:20:21] Darkaros: Basically just the former
[1:20:22] Velxir: I love league but I suck at it, all the colors and effects make my eyes glaze over

[2:12:49] Kyuukotsu: 100% smurf then. If he plays it in literally every lane it's a 1trick smurf.
[2:12:52] kazen01: riot just alows smurfs so it wont change
