[0:34:35] LessSanity: for example, phil hyping his team up and being optimistic about xbox got people going fucking crazy
[0:34:41] raptorscream: imo Sony is the worst out of the big 3, especially monetization
[0:34:54] raptorscream: and exclusitivity

[0:44:19] LegendsOfBobby: 30 mins is the avg. when you que up i think it says 25-30 mins
[0:44:30] raptorscream: ok
[0:44:37] LegendsOfBobby: is strippin playing xer?
[0:44:42] GingerPurple: @chrisgodsman "silver"
[0:44:56] Sophiaan31: nah strip is briar jungle
[0:45:04] 14neo: @LegendsOfBobby well, they've made it to Silver. trying to get to Gold/Plat - but uhh, Strippin loses much more LP for losses, than he gains for wins - so gonna be a thing ijp7

[0:48:53] raptorscream: that*
[0:49:20] raptorscream: map awarness at this rank seems to be lacking
[0:49:30] LegendsOfBobby: he just needs more wards. the xer. hes getting hooked from fog a lot
[0:49:32] Zyntho: @raptorscream pulse? might be a different skin that makes it look different?
[0:49:33] AnorienNightwish: ijpHI JP & chat
[0:49:58] raptorscream: @Zyntho it pulsed and did dmg with every pulse, maybe it was another character with similar ability

[0:53:42] Debazor: Is JP playing Karthas mid?
[0:53:42] raptorscream: @Zyntho oh, it has vvery low cooldown, nad he spamed it
[0:53:48] 14neo: @Debazor Strippin took a calculated risk, but ended up losing all his LP gain from yesterday solo, sooo hopefully the odds favor him soonTM ijp7
[0:53:51] LegendsOfBobby: good ward
[0:54:05] Darkaros: Hmm Any Gamepass Payday 3 players know if you can preinstall this game?
[0:54:13] chrisgodsman: Climbing silver so much harder than gold Kappa
[0:54:27] raptorscream: @Darkaros ill look it up now and tell you
[0:54:34] Debazor: Wait Karthas can adc now? O.o
[0:54:47] raptorscream: yes you can pre-install, Darkaros
[0:55:02] raptorscream: how long is the laning phase, usually?
[0:55:05] Debazor: Also @14neo sounds rough. Hopefully they can pull off some good wins today!
[0:55:05] Galoari: is there a ytube channel that's the go to for learning the basics strats of lol ? rotations, ward placements etc?
[0:55:09] LegendsOfBobby: i mean any champ can play any role...
[0:55:16] Zyntho: @raptorscream 10-15
[0:55:19] LegendsOfBobby: "adc" is just the lane assignment
[0:55:26] Darkaros: @Debazor nah JP's "just" playing Karthus bottom, traditional build
[0:56:00] 14neo: @Debazor ijpNODDERS
[0:56:09] LegendsOfBobby: i see the beatseating allowed. but i know league is kind of a hard game to take stuff on
[0:56:17] Zyntho: @raptorscream extra gold for turret plates end at 14 minutes
[0:56:20] ReMaestro: @Debazor Karthus does look like a bottom Kappa
[0:56:21] Debazor: Ahhhhh okay. I’m so out of the LoL loop LUL
[0:56:29] LegendsOfBobby: lol rea

[1:43:34] Zyntho: @DocOakum KEKW
[1:43:39] nakata545: supports get gold just by existing near minion kills and he somehow had no gold
[1:43:45] RhodesToRome: are we having fun yet?
[1:43:48] Darkaros: KEKW Naut might've done less damage to enemy champs than minions did
[1:43:54] STNbond: too busy treating the game like an IM session instead of playing the game

[1:47:58] RhodesToRome: Is this music helping you stay relaxed JP?
[1:48:06] Maklen5050: not at this ELO usually
[1:48:10] Xinder88: It’s trying to find that Naut again
[1:48:30] drinkfreak2: why would bronze ranked stream snipe Kappa
[1:48:40] Fynagle: Another problem with low-ELO is if you don't adhere to the meta, it will menteally screw with your teammates.
[1:48:42] Zyntho: Why would anyone pay for that lol. sounds awful
[1:48:48] Galoari: wait snipe and LOSE?

[1:49:43] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Strivus you are my favourite sub?
[1:50:07] Ahoy_NATO: people also ban the new shit, because they dont want to learn
[1:50:24] nakata545: people have been banning her to keep teammates picking the 40% winrate champ
[1:50:26] Noytron: I'm glad naafiri doesn't get banned as much anymore xD some of the most fun i've had since Akshan
[1:50:26] SixPointFive: I ban my own team from 35% win rate heroes lol
[1:50:35] Exitarnium: Isnt it also LoL tradition that new heroes are either severely overtuned or undertuned? Or did they finally learn to release balanced champs
[1:51:00] itmeBOT: If you're enjoying the stream, click the Follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[1:51:08] nakata545: they release balanced champs about as often as overtuned and undertuned
[1:51:27] nakata545: maybe a bit more overtuned than the other 2 but still
[1:51:29] Ahoy_NATO: @Exitarnium Most champs now release well balanced, but people have no idea how to play them on release and they look like shit so riot overbuffs them and cause them to be broken
[1:51:45] faintfractal: I hate that. I always restart the queue if there's a leaver for that reason

[2:02:31] philofyore: What's the point in botting?
[2:02:34] 14neo: they definitely outplay enemy teams a lot, but sometimes enemy teams just suck too
[2:03:00] 14neo: @philofyore to deliberately lose matches to derank so you can sell them?
[2:03:03] omgitsjason: eventually sell the account philofyore
[2:03:04] 14neo: as in, the accounts
[2:03:18] philofyore: Oooo interesting, that's wild

[7:16:43] 14neo: @garry_leonard Oh yeah, certainly. he's just comfy with Karthus currently - he did try several champs first time in ranked, but to clarify - has already been giving advice to Strippin about not playing different champs he's not accustomed with, to stick with what works ijp7
[7:17:07] ChaosMole: Sorry to ask that question while you play another Game JP, but any chance you will check out the First Descendant Open beta?
[7:17:29] 14neo: i am unsure how well it would go over with Strippin if he suddenly changes his tone and plays different heroes again ijpLAUGH
