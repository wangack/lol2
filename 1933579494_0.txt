[1:38:13] spacepiratezod: If you go into the game expecting an awesome Greek mythology/history game and not Assassins' Creed its a much better experience
[1:38:13] philofyore: Yea honestly I looked at the map and kinda balked
[1:38:14] zymioi: @philofyore Hello i am playing it and it’s great little out dated but good
[1:38:36] AltraWolf: @philofyore if you think that map is huge,  then don't look at AC Valhalla then

[1:39:18] Darkaros: Odyssey and Origins are great. Says a lot that a sponsored strim years after release random people come by to gush about it instead of bash it
[1:39:19] SamMFJackson: they dont really tie anything into the main AC series until the DLC
[1:39:23] Do_Not_Pursue: @AvivLobel madman
[1:39:24] MadCat27: It's Greek Mercenary game, not AC

[1:39:31] dasmex: Valhalla was way too damn long imo
[1:39:32] spacepiratezod: Valhalla has a much slower start IMO
[1:39:40] Fynagle: You mean like how Black Flag got better reception because everyone loved doing pirate stuff instead of assassin stuff?

[1:39:59] philofyore: Oh cool, thanks Sam, theyre the two very RPG heavy AC right?
[1:40:04] AltraWolf: @Fynagle exactly that,  being a Viking instead of a assassin
[1:40:07] TylerDrake1790: @Baby_hippopotas put that back stripCop

[1:40:52] NoorElBahrain: Fynagle everyone liked being a pirate so much Ubi made a spinoff game hypeE ijpKEK
[1:40:55] Swiftfool: @itmeJP building oblivion orb and then moving onto void staff is better than just finishing the entire Oblivion orb into Morello. Because Oblivion orb gives the same amount of grevious wounds as morello
[1:40:56] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: what the ap version of ldr?

[1:43:25] AltraWolf: @NoorElBahrain I don't think they will but its a very very basic game that won't gain any traction.  If they do cancel it im going to be surprised cause so many companies worked on it already

[2:44:09] Raphiezar: @Galoari How easy is it to get into that game as a casual game player?
[2:44:09] jeffhunter12: the fiddle?
[2:44:13] BlueSapphyre: Hades is v good. One of the best games ever made.
[2:44:16] ToppTheDwarf: @Galoari its so good
[2:44:17] Brightbane: Is this the lady from Hades?
[2:44:18] Darkaros: One day I'll see either of these streamers beat Hades 10x Aware
[2:44:19] Raphiezar: To anyone who's played.
[2:44:22] Darkaros: yeh Brightbane
[2:44:23] jeffhunter12: fiddles wards use fake abilities when spotted
[2:44:37] Darkaros: If you're a casual player, there's a "God Mode" that makes it progressively easier Raphiezar
[2:44:39] EvilEden: Hades is top tier. You would not regret giving it a shot
[2:44:51] 14neo: @Darkaros ijpSUFFER

[2:46:00] FiraVII: Dang it was a party bot lane
[2:46:00] RobbedGamer: Hands
[2:46:03] Raphiezar: Joms gives gifts then?
[2:46:05] 14neo: @Raphiezar depends on how casual you are really. i had a relative who's barely played games ever play it, and fall in love with it - yes, they struggled at first (nature of the game) and improved slower, but did get lots of fun out of it and get to a good skill lvl eventually ijp7
[2:46:12] uui23: well kayle will probably never roam
[2:46:17] Shoaron: whelp
[2:47:02] Galoari: can jinx be anything else than bot ?
[2:47:11] Raphiezar: @14neo That's good, because I've heard a lot of good things about the game, I have no idea how much skill it required.
[2:47:11] Stickiler: @Galoari Nope
[2:47:18] LokiTheHarvester: what runes does senna go?
[2:47:47] Shoaron: that ult was so close
[2:47:57] BroqRox: not quite, you took a big chunk of his hp
[2:48:05] Darkaros: Hades is definitely harder than other Supergiant games, but all of them have a baseline difficulty that's meant to be doable by everyone in quick time, with optional difficulty mods
[2:48:09] Darkaros: (in-game ones)
[2:48:09] Raphiezar: Nice!
[2:48:20] 14neo: @Raphiezar i would definitely not call it a 'hardcore' game - but not 'too easy' either. also what Darkaros added explains the rest
