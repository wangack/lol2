[1:36:45] Adventos: They gotta sell your data man Madge

[1:37:31] k0jak: it's fairly easy imo to get the quest 2 working with steam
[1:37:34] Gnutelbit: Air Link works really well for PC game.
[1:37:37] chobinhood_: @WDForty difference is you can just use a throwaway email and it doesnt matter

[1:38:43] k0jak: you could also buy like a 20$ keyboard
[1:38:43] Kyanilis: It'll feel different
[1:38:44] Spikey_spooder: whithout muscle memory?
[1:38:44] SpaceGhost8: it would be weird not feeling the keys
[1:38:44] LiteralZero: great song though

[1:38:55] bitspirit3: Yeah but learning to play the piano is omega hard
[1:38:58] TommYB0y: you need the feeling of the real keys
[1:38:58] WDForty: it'll depend on how you learn
[1:38:58] Navaeir: my partner would be pissed if I had gotten her a VR headset instead of a piano LUL
[1:38:59] NomsTaiters: its a bad way to learn piano

[1:39:10] eridani3: NODDERS same
[1:39:13] Norrak1: Is that a pink mullet?
[1:39:14] ffiveAM: without hte tactile feel of the keys on the fingers, it'd feel so weird. it's totally different (as a piano player)
[1:39:15] CasualGamerKing: I mean, maybe if they had an augment so it could show that over a real piano
[1:39:17] epicshoo: PepegaPls Looking

[1:39:31] DoctorJustinCase: I would smack the shit out of my friends if we play BeatSaber
[1:39:33] countmarcula: i feel like not having tactile feedback of actual keys would lead to really bad technique
[1:39:34] dragonbotherer: yeah....that's not the same. there's no weight to the keys.

[3:27:42] simaryex: @itmeJP tech 20 is reccomended for cyberware and thats with all builds basicly
[3:27:42] SEV65x54: thumbnail is BOOBA so i come
[3:27:48] Madracah: @itmeJP 4 in all is solid to unlock the first tier in any tree.
[3:27:48] HeeroMaki: err 1.0
[3:27:52] fantomexpls: Thumbnail baiting
[3:27:57] Andoheim_: It's entirely possible to play this with no cyberware
[3:28:05] ShowtimeTylers: ya its not required atpCap
[3:28:09] Madracah: yeap thats solid.
[3:28:16] SweCap: Best is to give all equal first so you wont miss some locked abilitys
[3:28:17] ShowtimeTylers: you are no pigeonholed into doing anything,
[3:28:24] simaryex: @ConstantK__ possible yes  minmaxed/optimal, No
[3:28:26] ChaosMole: I play without cyberware "mostly" and without helth regen and I finished the base game today, so it does work
[3:28:27] MrPalladium: yeah nomad
[3:28:38] Andoheim_: Minnaxing is for nerds
[3:28:43] countmarcula: it definitely encourages synergies with stuff though. Like netrunning skills pair with monowire and smart guns
[3:28:47] ShowtimeTylers: I dont think that JP gives a fuck about playing optimally atpCap @simaryex
[3:28:47] Madracah: @itmeJP you can respec perk points on the fly , only stat points matter longterm.
[3:28:51] dasmex: KEKW
[3:28:52] ShowtimeTylers: lol
[3:28:53] CZJames20: you can change her no worries
[3:28:55] javidesign95: big chilling
[3:28:56] ReginaldXIV: RESET
[3:28:57] Meliea_EU: i prefer nomad of the 3
[3:29:03] 14neo: you just gotta wait for the fashion choices, trust peepoSad
[3:29:05] Andareas: Hey jp and chat. How are you doing today?
[3:29:08] ReginaldXIV: Looks like the lady from Warehouse 13
[3:29:15] ScorchHellfire: you don't see yourself much though right?
[3:29:16] simaryex: @ShowtimeTylers someone clearly missed his BG3 run kekW
[3:29:21] bullet_rain_: whats the graphics settings
[3:29:22] Andoheim_: Wait, did JP start a new game?
[3:29:23] AnorienNightwish: @ReginaldXIV ijpHUH
[3:29:37] MrPalladium: no pom pom
[3:29:39] ChaosMole: how so?
[3:29:48] TORIwoo: not on twitch
[3:29:49] ChaosMole: like is there a lot?
[3:29:53] Darkaros: there's a streamer mode that they fixed to definitely work to hide dmca songs
[3:29:54] Xerkaw: Burkes Vod was muted abit
[3:29:56] BroqRox: AAAA RAGE AAAA FURY
[3:29:56] 14neo: well, i'd recommend having the 'Copyright music turned off' option anyway just in case?
[3:29:58] P4rappa: Big music g-men on the way already.
[3:29:59] UnknownToChaos: UnknownToChaos is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to itmeJP's community! They've gifted a total of 8 in the channel!

[3:29:59] UnknownToChaos: UnknownToChaos gifted a Tier 1 sub to AlmostNameless! 
[3:30:01] bullet_rain_: coming from starfield its so weird not being able to pick up every single item
[3:30:03] CZJames20: on twitch its fine
[3:30:09] Robbsinsky: I think just Body Heat radio is having issues according to CDPR
[3:30:10] TORIwoo: streamer mod is for pussies
[3:30:13] ShowtimeTylers: @Darkaros did they actually fix it? some days ago people were still having issues
[3:30:20] Meliea_EU: played it only once at released, its interesting now the second
[3:30:29] Darkaros: @ShowtimeTylers again? KEKW it had issues on launch that they said they fixed
[3:30:47] ThrottleJunkie: if you turned off the dmca music in options you are fine. but the vod will be muted in sections.
[3:30:47] 14neo: That being said, there is like one song or so that goes through the 'copyright music turned off' thing due to some issue - until that is resolved (might already have been), one of the radio sections shouldn't be listened to yet ijpHMM
[3:30:51] ShowtimeTylers: oh no dude it was having issues again for the DLC, yes again LUL @Darkaros
[3:30:54] CZJames20: theres is some ghosting with the new DLSS yes
[3:30:56] Wychlight: ?
[3:30:56] TommYB0y: see what
[3:30:57] SweCap: That's DLSS...
[3:31:00] fantomexpls: cnat see
[3:31:01] dasmex: I don't see it
[3:31:05] ShowtimeTylers: we dont see ghosting
[3:31:06] Andoheim_: That is Ray reconstruction
[3:31:09] venomsnake228: yes I also had that ghosting
[3:31:14] BroqRox: @14neo is there a mod for it?
[3:31:17] CZJames20: they are working on it, to get it fixed
[3:31:19] venomsnake228: its becoz of ray reconstruction
[3:31:21] ShuGaming: those are the cheat frames Kappa
[3:31:22] ChaosMole: Ghosting got "more" with the latest DLLS :\
[3:31:35] LagoutLoud: DLSS on performance modes have lots of ghosting
[3:31:40] LagoutLoud: better on the other modes
[3:31:42] venomsnake228: @CZJames20 did they said that somewhere?
[3:31:43] countmarcula: "satisficing"? Hmm
[3:31:50] Andoheim_: @itmejp did you start a whole new game or is this just pl?
[3:31:51] MrPalladium: mike the dick
[3:32:00] ShowtimeTylers: its a new save

[3:32:04] Nootrishus: a weeeeeeeeeeerd
[3:32:19] vonSternn: nomads start
[3:32:25] CZJames20: @venomsnake228 yea I saw them mention it on twitter I think
[3:32:26] 14neo: @BroqRox i dunno ijpSHRUG i think 'Body heat radio' channel or so like the earlier chatter said, should be avoided
[3:32:37] vonSternn: very nice
[3:32:44] CZJames20: I love her voice
[3:32:50] MrPalladium: that nomad car has a nice turbo sound
[3:32:52] Kyanilis: "who?"
[3:32:55] Sir_RobsterRoll: nomad? Pog
[3:32:55] bullet_rain_: do you like that the dialogue is slightly different compared to the choice given?
[3:32:55] venomsnake228: @itmeJP  you can turn off ray reconstruction to stop the ghosting on NPC faces
[3:32:56] Wychlight: Last war was the Unification wars
[3:33:02] ShowtimeTylers: I'd just run his ass over atpCap
[3:33:07] SweCap: the Growl station is the new one with User made music and Sasha Grey DJ

[3:35:24] MrPalladium: yeah esp with space bar to drift
[3:35:26] JeXus1985: try making a turn, if you crash into the right side of the road, it still sucks
[3:35:33] Jagedih: motorcycles felt always good
[3:35:35] ShowtimeTylers: the driving used to feel like you were ice skating, its absolutely better
[3:35:37] Jagedih: really fun to zoom
[3:35:37] LagoutLoud: feels better but still not great on M&K imo
[3:35:48] JeXus1985: *right-hand turn, I shoudl say
[3:35:53] countmarcula: i like driving with controller 🤷
[3:35:55] Moose2033: go too fast and you start fish-tailing
[3:35:56] Robbsinsky: Lower steering sensitivity slightly makes keyboard feel a bit better
[3:35:56] Wychlight: I didn't have any issues drive....lol
[3:36:01] Supwizy: Wish I could plug in my Mouse and keyboard on ps5

[3:38:15] TORIwoo: you cant
[3:38:17] ingrtan: R as radio
[3:38:19] Ageisfang: R is radio
[3:38:21] Thulen: hold R for selection, not sure if you can in tutorial
[3:38:21] JeXus1985: not in range of night city radios I think

[3:39:31] DecadaentAusterity: Jackie gets around
[3:39:45] Thulen: HahaReindeer this game look so different if you have hdr on
[3:39:49] simaryex: @itmeJP did you start over completly or did the PL "skip to"?
[3:39:58] Ageisfang: @countmarcula lol yeah true, maybe the cyberware is just that good and has little forcefields around them/nanomachines blocking/cleaning the grime
[3:40:04] 14neo: he's played through the game to completion before - but yeah, no Phantom Liberty spoilers please
[3:40:06] Jagedih: in few days :D
[3:40:06] Thekyuubi: Jackie is going to be our best bud and going to be on a adventure for us for a long time
[3:40:10] Hyperbolicstranger: That works, have a great run!
[3:40:14] Archangel3003: I shall avoid reading chat much then as only got part way through this game twice as guess I've got to do a third playthrough now with 2.0 lol
[3:40:18] Carefreetyler: probably in a few days, 10-15 hours if you mainline it
[3:40:19] ScorchHellfire: gotta do the voodoo boys bit
[3:40:21] bullet_rain_: @Thekyuubi Clueless
[3:40:25] vonSternn: the right choice
[3:40:29] countmarcula: cool, gives me time watch while i work and avoid dlc spoilers
[3:40:29] ShowtimeTylers: I recommend to just play normally, dont rush to the DLC
[3:40:30] Ageisfang: you just have to get through act 2, so...like 15h or so maybe?
[3:40:32] Shoaron: why restart completely when you have already finished the game LUL
[3:40:35] MrPalladium: lords of fallen?

[3:41:11] CZJames20: it doesnt work now
[3:41:11] ChaosMole: ^
[3:41:13] markbart1: @countmarcula thanks
[3:41:15] Incredible_Sausage: @Shoaron because they changed the entire game up and down
[3:41:17] DecadaentAusterity: After the main Judy tract
[3:41:18] Hyperbolicstranger: DLC works best if you've got a few perks under your belt, though
[3:41:22] bullet_rain_: what difficulty is this?
[3:41:30] ScorchHellfire: @markbart1 dlc can have its own ending that happens instead of the base game endings

[3:43:35] ScorchHellfire: @markbart1 yeah, it all depends with who you side with. one lets you still do the old endings and the other happens instead of them and can cause you to skip a lot of the game if you go past the point of no return
[3:43:46] 14neo: funnily enough, i haven't seen much of Phantom Liberty yet, sooo I am unsure if I want the sniper rifle or not - but will likely get it anyway soonTM ijpLAUGH
[3:44:01] Guts72: nomad is the best imo

[4:10:40] countmarcula: @Archangel3003 You just need to finish the quest "Transmission", it's the one with the voodoo boys. You can do anything after that except Meet Hanako at Embers, that will lock you into the end game
[4:10:50] ChaosMole: I don't want to spoiler anything that's why I am bit cryptic
[4:10:55] Zuleyus: @Archangel3003 there's a PONR in the main story, but I don't know the exact mission. you can access the DLC anytime after finishing "Transmission" though
[4:11:12] ChaosMole: Folks that was not what was asked
[4:11:22] ChaosMole: I know that you do not ahve to finish the basegame
[4:11:26] Guevon_Jon: wait, im new here, but has JP waited long time to just play both when PL comes out? I know hes a patient gamer
[4:11:29] countmarcula: @Zuleyus "Meet Hanako at Embers" is the PONR
[4:11:35] Guevon_Jon: thats awesome
[4:11:36] Zuleyus: @Bakanoodle just say openly that you kill everything with dildos ijpLAUGH
[4:12:08] ChaosMole: also you actually can finish the base game and then do the DLC the DLC will not be locked
[4:12:17] ChaosMole: I know because I finished the absegame today
[4:12:44] ChaosMole: but again that was not what the person has asked me
[4:12:46] Skiskow: @Guevon_Jon Just replaying it. Hasn't played since 1.0
[4:13:36] PHbulad: It really sucks they won’t let you keep this lmg
[4:13:47] PHbulad: Better than whatever lmg the one you can carry
[4:14:09] countmarcula: he was gonna try to jump straight into PL but the skill tree and everything is kinda overwhelming if you're not starting from scratch
[4:14:12] Guevon_Jon: @Skiskow ah, nice
[4:14:13] BernardsRegards: should have made a perk to keep these LMGs
[4:14:27] itmeBOT: If you're enjoying the stream, click the Follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[4:14:29] Zuleyus: @ChaosMole Arch asked if he should do base story first before starting dlc, you said yes for first run, my info up to what you just said was that you couldn't enter dlc after the PONR, so under that belief your advice was plain wrong.
[4:14:39] SweatyT3d: !specs
[4:14:39] itmeBOT: JP's specs/gear can be found at https://itme.jp/specs
[4:15:21] PHbulad: I hardly get to use these type of lmg. By the time I can grab one I already clearness police area
[4:15:28] Archangel3003: Chat, is Emu Deck the emulator I want on my Steam Deck?
[4:15:35] PHbulad: Cleared*
[4:15:43] ChaosMole: No i said that you should finish the base game to put the ending into perspective with the ending in PL. That was my point. that is all
[4:15:48] DobbsjustDobbs: Yo JP https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1707149244996505858?s=20
[4:16:21] ChaosMole: But you do NOT have to do the DLC sooo that is right
[4:16:29] ChaosMole: ahh abse game
[4:16:35] ShowtimeTylers: Fair point
[4:16:41] yraelvaint: ijpNEVILLE
[4:16:43] Guomi: For context, is this ending of PL itself or the new ending available with PL
[4:16:56] NightFaeFox: ijpONO
[4:17:01] Ch1_1ck: does it make a ticking sound?
[4:17:04] Guomi: ijpONO

[4:17:07] yraelvaint: ijpSAD that sucks man
[4:17:10] ChaosMole: @Guomi New ending inside of PL
[4:17:14] countmarcula: NOOOO
[4:17:16] tyree_sanada: RIP
[4:17:16] BernardsRegards: DIY mirror assembly
[4:17:18] Guomi: I am getting flashbacks of Zeke's Larry pack...
[4:17:19] Thekyuubi: There is a new ending that you can get when you beat PL and then finish the base story iirc
[4:17:23] DobbsjustDobbs: Jim Ryan stepping down
[4:17:24] Archangel3003: @countmarcula @Zuleyus Ok so get to the PONR mission, then do PL and then can finish rest main story past PONR.
[4:17:38] bakavic: huh
[4:17:48] countmarcula: @Archangel3003 that's one way to do it, yup
[4:17:50] alphonseisbest: Yooooo
[4:17:54] LifeModelDecoy: me
[4:18:00] DobbsjustDobbs: No clue just the inside rumors he's gone

[4:18:11] LifeModelDecoy: I'm heading out up now.. NODDERS
[4:18:13] tyree_sanada: @dobbsjustdobbs who is that
[4:18:43] Blind238: i need to up my settings, haven't seen those water drops
[4:18:47] DobbsjustDobbs: Playstation boss
[4:18:57] Shoaron: there sdrops for this?
[4:19:00] Zuleyus: @Archangel3003 it does make sense to start the dlc earlier, because you'll get to level up a new skill tree that's independent from the base areas. I wouldn't really stress it much and just go in there whenever you feel like it, it'll all be many hours of gametime anyway
[4:19:01] tyree_sanada: @dobbsjustdobbs Aw damn
[4:19:02] countmarcula: you know you're in a mature chat when people aren't spamming booba on this part
[4:19:09] Guomi: Is the boss of Playstation as whole or some specific dvision
[4:19:14] Blind238: @countmarcula booba

[4:21:01] Blind238: @countmarcula you must be american
[4:21:03] loksmurfen: TOS on boobs?
[4:21:05] Archangel3003: @Zuleyus Seems kinda confusing to just dump a mid game DLC that you can only play at a certain point and blends with ending of main game kind of.
[4:21:12] countmarcula: @Blind238 YEP
[4:21:13] kimchi_sv: Need more jiggle physics
[4:21:17] tyree_sanada: Does JP not sometimes do blue options?
[4:21:43] DobbsjustDobbs: THey're for flavor and I think he's just trying to get to DLC
[4:21:53] Archangel3003: @loksmurfen Nudity is ok in video games as long as it's not the main focus of the game.
[4:22:00] Zuleyus: @Archangel3003 a little, yeah, but they really upgraded the entire game with 2.0 anyway

[4:37:34] Thekyuubi: Retiring
[4:37:39] BuffaloTheory: His words were "I’ve been finding it increasingly difficult to strike the right balance between having my home in the UK and my job in the United States"
[4:37:42] ChaosMole: throwing knives are bae
[4:37:43] DobbsjustDobbs: @itmeJP just FYI you can freely respec all your perk points spent inside the skill tree, but you only get one respec for the Stat points you use
[4:37:49] k0jak: https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2023/new-management-structure-of-sony-interactive-entertainment-2/
[4:38:33] Archangel3003: @ChaosMole The throwing knife that comes back after a cooldown was so good for stealth. Satisfying as hell to land a head shot with a throwing knife
[4:38:35] Guomi: Whole lotta new chrome choom
[4:38:56] CZJames20: yes
[4:39:00] EnvyLeviathan_: ya
[4:39:00] MrPalladium: yeah since patch 2.0
[4:39:01] CZJames20: everything
[4:39:01] StevoRay: yep
[4:39:01] ChaosMole: yes
[4:39:01] Exorius: ye
[4:39:02] Guomi: Archangel3003 throwing knives are still fun even if I need a better one
[4:39:02] alphonseisbest: Ye
[4:39:03] Madracah: it got remade
[4:39:04] ArcHeRHooD: Yes
[4:39:06] DobbsjustDobbs: redesigned
[4:39:18] vordican: attribute points open up more of the tree perk points are spent in the tree
[4:39:19] Guomi: Most of the "do X more damage" were consolidated into skills
[4:39:20] k0jak: comment from jim ryan in that post: After 30 years, I have made the decision to retire from SIE in March 2024. I’ve relished the opportunity to have a job I love in a very special company, working with great people and incredible partners. But I’ve found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America. {then thanks sony and some people}
[4:39:25] EnvyLeviathan_: lots of references to edgerunners too
[4:39:27] Guomi: Go back one and skill progression
[4:39:34] MrPalladium: theres also skill progresion redesign also
[4:39:54] vordican: those unlock as you use certain items/abilities
[4:39:56] Zeinternetz: It's xp rewards for using different skills
[4:39:57] DobbsjustDobbs: Those go up by just doing things
[4:40:00] Guomi: Loosely stealth, hacking, blades, brute force, grenades
[4:40:01] CZJames20: this basically skyrim system, more you use..
[4:40:01] alphonseisbest: Ye
[4:40:02] CyberLetho: The devs explaine it better
[4:40:02] EnvyLeviathan_: ya
[4:40:06] bakavic: yea, those are passive gains based on what you use
[4:40:07] MrPalladium: yeah, depends on how you play and weapons u use
[4:40:40] Archangel3003: I love stuff that unlocks as you do it, kinda like Skyrim. The game adapting to your play style and you improving by doing.
[4:40:42] MrPalladium: some of new cars are sweet
[4:40:48] ArcHeRHooD: You basically want to start thinking and planning 1 or 2 things you want to be doing in this game. Ex. Tanky with some hacks/Silent blades user/ etc. and plan around 1 or 2 attributes to focus maxing 1st
[4:41:03] MrPalladium: more people also
[4:41:08] Zeinternetz: Way less buggy for sure
[4:41:14] ChaosMole: also love that Items don't have lvls anymore but just tier system
[4:41:44] Vilerious: Is JP running any mods?
[4:41:45] DobbsjustDobbs: The itemization is a little too simple for my liking now but it is MILES better than it was at launch
[4:41:46] Archangel3003: @Guomi Yeah I mostly used that and a pistol. Then had a sword for when in close or a shotgun for beefy foes.
[4:41:59] BroqRox: punch mtx
[4:42:00] Zeinternetz: @ChaosMole Yeah upgrading iconics for 40 levels was grating
[4:42:01] CZJames20: poor bot
[4:42:08] Thekyuubi: Don't break those lovely nails

[4:44:50] countmarcula: huh, i thought the whole point of reflex boost was that it helped with latency from frame gen
[4:44:52] CZJames20: it should still look very good
[4:45:21] SweCap: thats the frame generation fake frames = latency
[4:45:26] Vilerious: FG does that

[4:46:28] MrPalladium: no more op modding on weapons nmow
[4:46:39] CZJames20: @itmeJP this should help - Go to Controls, all the way to the bottom, and set Response Curve to Raw
[4:46:48] RVIII: B
[4:46:48] simaryex: @Kane_Harkonnen tahts wrong, iconic can be from t1-t5

[5:24:51] countmarcula: i feel like that was a subtle reference to the fixers constantly trying to sell you cars in 1.0
[5:24:53] Nootrishus: De4dMaNz should pick up the new DLC too, honestly it is even better than base game
[5:25:34] Archangel3003: Ok I gotta dip as it's my first early shift for work in awhile and getting up at 4:30am is a killer. Enjoy the game all!
