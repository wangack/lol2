[1:41:48] ReginaldXIV: They don't know anything, they're just moving money around between shareholders, CEOs and any profit goes to stock options and not the workers. Something that used to be illegal til Reagan
[1:41:50] dasmex: by causing it
[1:41:56] Neragsito: recession has been coming since 2022... it hasn't
[1:41:59] N3llee: see gamestop info

[2:16:09] Exorius: enemies scale down to your level now
[2:16:14] CZJames20: its very diferent based on the choices you make here
[2:16:19] Archangel3003: It's harder fighting the gang as you have no help I think

[2:17:48] Soulofdragon01: @GassyMexican is use "Cyber Engine Tweaks" (requirement) + "autoloot" + "Better Loot Markers" (on nexusmods)
[2:18:03] GassyMexican: many thanks
[2:18:17] Truder2k: @simaryex agreed, but there is a way to mitigate it, and still maintaining more areas viable, by scaling content to a lesser extent than the player scales
