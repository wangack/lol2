[0:48:53] dreamonb: Maybe you are turning into a vampire?
[0:48:56] weniver: was he playingn half life Alyx? can you play it without cables in quest?
[0:49:04] klumpurinn: if it could be used as an additive to work. Fx if you work on a number of tasks on a single laptop but then can use the headset to AR in additional monitors for other tasks and such and go back and forth as needed then yeah maybe
[0:49:07] Gertew: Bedge Starfield
[0:49:16] countmarcula: having a playback monitor in adobe premiere that's the size of an imax screen would be pretty sweet

[0:50:01] WDForty: i think that's the best thing to market for regular non-gamers, the ability to watch movies in IMAX at home
[0:50:01] KelticNight: GG, job done Clap
[0:50:04] KingRahe: @KelticNight we will never turly know unless he eats after midnight but then again its always after midnight...
[0:50:05] frosht42: that's all the bugs though, remember, almost no bugs in it Kappa

[0:51:02] Norrak1: The warhammer game has a demo

[0:52:43] RlDennis: Jusant is that climbing game right?
[0:53:05] Darkaros: most wishlisted's default yet
[0:53:11] thesestrangenotions: Redfall definitely wasn't abandoned, Xbox doubled down, but the devs wanted to
[0:53:12] Darkaros: yeh*. also proves that wishlisting matters
[0:53:16] Norrak1: Anyone tried the Warhammer Realms of Ruin game? It has 3 maps I think
[0:53:17] jovial_22: What is the stream mascot supposed to be? A gremlin?
[0:53:34] bakavic: turnip boy went from tax fraud to robbing banks now?

[0:57:36] Miceed: I dunno wish I could of demo-ed my wife
[0:57:38] thesestrangenotions: I mean I watch most during League but that's more like going to the zoo
[0:57:40] Bob__Z: Demo is like ADHD sim
[0:57:46] ReMaestro: why is it cuck, if i am watching someone edging? Susge
[0:57:47] Miros__: Ohhh yeah, PLAY those games for me daddyJP...

[0:58:13] THE_BBP: all the time
[0:58:13] ghst_WLF: at least once a week
[0:58:18] Miros__: not ever
[0:58:20] lonew0lfgamer: Though, in the case of the Gollum game, who really suffered?
[0:58:22] Juksrace: JP is not influencer but a male performer now ;)
[0:58:23] countmarcula: oh Karma Zoo has a demo tho
[0:58:27] dimwitt127: It wasn't holy, nor Roman, nor an empire
[0:58:30] Killian_Hart: atleast once a month. the roman empire fell to lead poisoning
[0:58:39] ワフルデラ: I sometimes think about the roman empire and how it got burnt
[0:58:40] lordsnow85: Not more than once a day probably
[0:58:43] THE_BBP: thats a different empire
[0:58:47] beararsed: well it was all three but ok
[0:58:50] Gorn_Vernaleer: wrong one
[0:58:52] Vonpoot: Yeah I only think about the OG Roman Empire
[0:58:52] tank967477: whats that statue in the center back?
[0:58:52] Killian_Hart: the roman empire and the holy roman empire were not the same
[0:58:53] klumpurinn: @dimwitt127 this guy sure has thought a lot about it i think
[0:58:55] der_dritte: There was the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, or something like that?
[0:59:00] KingRahe: i was gonna ask if we were talking holy roman empire or byzantine
[0:59:12] thesestrangenotions: Hole-y in their longevity?
[0:59:13] MustardDragon: Topics like this make me understand why we only at 370k followers hobbLUL
[0:59:13] Archangel3003: @Miros__ That Kaiju Princess game just popped up on my recommended for you list lol
[0:59:16] Gorn_Vernaleer: @der_dritte correct, that one wasnt joly, nor an empire, nor roman :D
[0:59:17] Darkaros: Can't be, he's alive >50% of the time
[0:59:19] Norrak1: @itmeJP Any plans for Lords of the Fallen Friday?
[0:59:21] Miceed: Cool

[0:59:41] MustardDragon: Just kidding guys
[0:59:41] itz_just_camel: make it 1 less
[0:59:41] Xflame: rude

[0:59:46] thanh_n2004: Wtf
[0:59:47] ReMaestro: "only" KEKW
[1:00:00] Xflame: we...does he have stocks in the stream?
[1:00:01] jovial_22: JP are you going to be watching Worlds?
[1:00:02] Darkaros: OUR follower count
[1:00:02] ReginaldXIV: I forgot there even is a follower count on Twitch lol
[1:00:02] thesestrangenotions: Evidence is here
[1:00:04] LeelandGrant: healthy
[1:00:06] der_dritte: Just so you know, JP, I realized during work today that there was no Dropped Frames, and got a little sad.
[1:00:08] keidoyume: HUH damn those emote are scary LUL
[1:00:09] altizar: that statue can't be strippin, that statue has hands
[1:00:10] thesestrangenotions: !followage
[1:00:10] Sophiaan31: oh noooo
[1:00:10] itmeBOT: We don't track followage. If you're on browser, you can click your own username to see how long you've been following the channel though!
[1:00:12] viixaan: view count andies
[1:00:13] SixPointFive: YIKKERS
[1:00:14] ghst_WLF: ouch
[1:00:15] Killian_Hart: oh sick, i also went on a ten game loss streak
[1:00:16] RVIII: yikes
[1:00:17] Hundisilm: In the evil Lol game?
[1:00:18] Playful_Fellow: some twitch comments are best left ignored to the brink of total ignorance of not reading them.
[1:00:22] Wurth: @itmejp I know its been painful but I have really enjoyed your duo LoL streams, thanks for them
[1:00:27] Archangel3003: @MustardDragon You clearly don't frequent Twitch much if you think a topic like this is bad. This is tame compared to how far these types of topics go on the platform lol.
[1:00:29] SchnellBier: back to the pit
[1:00:29] ReginaldXIV: I'm still bronze 1
[1:00:31] Miceed: Damn I don't get it
[1:00:35] GingerPurple: Hey we might be able to play together some time! i'm bronze 2 playing in lobbies with silver1/2 or gold 3/4's now
[1:00:41] ReginaldXIV: I'm getting screwed by the mmr
[1:00:42] TJStrider: have you been hit with the tax bill from your subathon yet? lol
[1:00:50] Hundisilm: @ReginaldXIV Is that the lowest rank?
[1:00:51] Galoari: the LoL streams rekindled my interest in twitch that was dying down for some time now
[1:00:54] Debazor: Hey hey folks!
[1:00:57] thumpper__: I wish you could co-stream Worlds with Strippin. I thiink that'd be a blast
[1:00:59] beararsed: damn, current silver two is about the same as bronze 1 about 2 years ago
[1:01:06] Heisuisui: silver slide, back to bronze wars
[1:01:08] MustardDragon: @Archangel3003 just goofin' - my bad
[1:01:09] thesestrangenotions: Better than getting back into ow like me
[1:01:10] Killian_Hart: oh for sure
[1:01:13] Archangel3003: Crime Scene Cleaner looks pretty cool. Like that Vicera (or whatever) cleanup game.
[1:01:13] Vonpoot: they changed it this season, it's broken
[1:01:15] SixPointFive: Your LOL streams make me laugh more than anything else recently
[1:01:16] THE_BBP: you probably shouldnt play it...
[1:01:17] dasmex: 100% for sure
[1:01:19] houseofdodo: Do you still have any contact with the old roleplay guys? Like Adam and the other DMs? Just curious
[1:01:25] ReginaldXIV: Ironically the best matchmaking was Overwatch 1 before they messed it up in OW2
[1:01:25] sourbeamttv: i thought LoL matchmaking is designed to enforce the 50-51% winrate
[1:01:27] mayosilog: What matchmaking?
[1:01:31] ghst_WLF: Could you possibly elaborate from someone that doesn't play it?
[1:01:32] QhetzZ: havent played valorant i assume xdd
[1:01:34] Darkaros: PepeLaugh There's a reason why forced 50-50 is a meme
[1:01:34] frosht42: Is it that or smurfs? PepoG
[1:01:38] Miros__: It may focus on reducing wait times more over best team/opponents
[1:01:42] ghst_WLF: oh here we go
[1:02:04] itmeBOT:  Ads are about to play! JP's Twitch contract has ended, and as a member of the ads incentive program he no longer has precise control over when ads run. Ads will run 180 seconds automatically every hour. As always, subscribing to the channel prevents ads. Thanks! ijpLOVE
[1:02:09] RVIII: its far better in solo queue, but the fact that it can't/doesnt line up equal skill levels by role
[1:02:14] Killian_Hart: i have to avoid playing at specific times of the day and week to avoid people who will tilt their asses off
[1:02:16] Heisuisui: KEKW
[1:02:18] Wurth: JESUS
[1:02:19] Hundisilm: how?
[1:02:24] frosht42: oh
[1:02:29] Miceed: ?????
[1:02:34] egaszinaf: that used to happen to me in dota 2 @itmeJP i dont think its a problem specifically of league
[1:02:35] SixPointFive: I wish companies didn't super push instant queue times, matchmaking used to be so much better when you could sit in queue for a while
[1:02:36] Killian_Hart: holy shit
[1:02:40] sourbeamttv: thats just dissapointing
[1:02:40] itz_just_camel: big oof
[1:02:42] Juksrace: not bad ;)
[1:02:43] hajime94: I remember there was iron on your team
[1:02:48] ワフルデラ: also NA League is dead
[1:02:54] Miceed: Oh right
[1:02:55] Nemm__: You can't carry that much bad
[1:02:58] THE_BBP: so you carried right???
[1:02:59] beararsed: not at this level
[1:03:05] RVIII: when matchmaking as a duo, it gives you like +3 or 4 ranks
[1:03:06] Killian_Hart: doesn't the matchmaking purposefully try to fuck you to make you grind for longer
[1:03:07] Miceed: But wtf
[1:03:07] UnboundSouls: ah yes, the ole Ball N Chain matchmaking
[1:03:08] thesestrangenotions: Unbalanced, as all matchmaking should be Kappa
[1:03:11] WDForty: do you think they should sac queue times to keep unranked out of ranked games??
[1:03:13] Sophiaan31: team game is still a team game lol
[1:03:16] Cytomis: Cytomis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 113 months! 
[1:03:16] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Cytomis you are my favourite sub?
[1:03:18] egaszinaf: @SixPointFive yeah, they forced reduced queue time which made it less balanced in skill of players, i felt that a lot
[1:03:20] JoshuaColossus: Duo Q also skew the matchmaking
[1:03:33] RlDennis: I remember trying to get to diamond first time around and I had around.. 20 promotion series completely ruined by afk's and trolls. It was the worst experience ever. ijpSUFFER My winrate was really good too, I was just getting denied by promo's ijpSUFFER
[1:03:45] SixPointFive: @egaszinaf Everyone is doing this. Matchmaking in every game is trash tier it seems
[1:03:54] jovial_22: JP are you going to be following Worlds?
[1:03:56] ReginaldXIV: if someone is doing heartseeker I change my entire build to fuck that one person
[1:03:57] Killian_Hart: i frequently get five minute queues in fuckin bronze, the whole system is broken
[1:04:01] Killian_Hart: as support
[1:04:04] LIVECODING: I haven't seen your LoL streams - is tilting in League worse or better for you than other multiplayer? e.g. sc2
[1:04:05] dreamonb: rumor is that riot is using this for their matchmaking https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06820.pdf%3Ca%20href=
[1:04:07] GingerPurple: I have a 54% winrate over all my games and i'm stuck in bronze...so like yeah screw matchmaking in league
[1:04:12] Galoari: 100% bot is the worst to be at if u are trying to climb to gold+
[1:04:13] Juksrace: duo Top/jungle then ;)
[1:04:13] Hundisilm: just find 5 friends :p
[1:04:18] shemg: Yea low elo top laners give free heartsteal stack for no reason
[1:04:18] ShockingIce: Done with lol now then
[1:04:19] egaszinaf: @SixPointFive yeah, they forced reduced queue time which made it less balanced in skill of players, i felt that a lot
[1:04:19] Hundisilm: 4
[1:04:22] dimwitt127: I used to play attack speed blitz jungle in ranked and had a lot of fun... my team rarely did though
[1:04:25] dreamonb: so according to that.. they do not optimize for fair
[1:04:27] MasterYuriCC: I agree stopped playing ranked years ago due to afks and match making issues.
[1:04:33] dreamonb: the optimize for engagement.
[1:04:39] dreamonb: they...
[1:04:40] Miceed: Risky link of the day
[1:04:41] Snorlax_pillow: correct me if i'm wrong, isn't it standard to queue full team for moba? Back when I was still playing Dota, I always did that
[1:04:45] ワフルデラ: League having a lower player count than other regions definitely doesn't help either
[1:04:48] egaszinaf: @egaszinaf sorry man i replied again with the same text cause i am an idiot and pressed the up arrow :D
[1:04:49] Killian_Hart: yeah engagement optimized mathcmaking. get them to spend as much time looking at the store and chasing the carrot
[1:04:52] ワフルデラ: so they are also forced to do those match ups
[1:04:57] Hundisilm: Has League ended many friendships I wonder
[1:05:00] Hundisilm: and games like that
[1:05:01] ShrowdArrow: any plans to try going back to top?
[1:05:04] itmeBOT: Join our public Discord! discord.gg/itmejp
[1:05:05] SchnellBier: you have to play league to have fun in the moment and ignore the big picture
[1:05:09] ReginaldXIV: I had my first actual mad team mate on my team the other day. That was funny
[1:05:10] jovial_22: @itmeJP are you going to be following Worlds?
[1:05:11] cherry_badger: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:05:11] SixPointFive: @dreamonb The abstract for that paper fills me with rage
[1:05:12] houseofdodo: Did something happen to LoL lately, there's been a huge influx of LoL-players coming over to dota and trying it out
[1:05:13] Darkaros: @Snorlax_pillow can't in ranked, in Dota either IIRC stripThink but in LoL "soloqueue" (which is also duos) is the main matchmaking
[1:05:15] Filou_icu: Filou_icu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! lol is hard
[1:05:15] itmeBOT: Thanks for resubscribing Filou_icu you are my favourite sub?
[1:05:22] Hundisilm: true
[1:05:34] Playful_Fellow: Ive never understood why i would play league when there are other better more interesting mobas, that are not made for kids. Boom! :D
[1:05:41] Snorlax_pillow: @Darkaros oh yeah, I never care about mmr so just do normal matchmaking
[1:05:43] Darkaros: @houseofdodo Dota publicly declared banning smurfs
[1:06:04] egaszinaf: @Darkaros its still not produced as good results as needed
[1:06:11] SixPointFive: Man... maybe I should move to DOTA
[1:06:11] shadow_njnja: Is mcu crew going to return for Loki?
[1:06:18] Gorn_Vernaleer: @playful_fellow which ones? Dota isn't better in any way and HotS is dead LUL
[1:06:24] ReginaldXIV: LoL actively encourages smurfing
[1:06:26] thecynicalshuffler: fuck those little blue fuckers :)\
[1:06:27] dreamonb: here is a qupte from the paper:
[1:06:29] Killian_Hart: the only thiong stopping me from playing dota is the turning speed on characters. i could never get used to it
[1:06:31] dreamonb: Matchmaking connects multiple players to participate in online player-versus-player games. Current matchmaking systems depend on a single core strategy: create fair games at all times. These systems pair similarly skilled players on the assumption that a fair game is best player experience. We will demonstrate, however, that this intuitive assumption sometimes fails and that matchmak- ing based on fairness is not optimal for engagement.
[1:06:33] Darkaros: I do wonder if there's a market for buying "rank-ready" accounts in Dota like there is in League of Legends KEKW
[1:06:33] Hundisilm: Y'all should just play Rocket League - its still quite ok over here :)
[1:06:34] houseofdodo: Oh it's the same with dota, . I don't feel like it's made a big difference in dota
[1:06:37] egaszinaf: @SixPointFive dont, its not better man! dont put yourself in the hassle
[1:06:40] HeartlessM: is DOTA still actively worked on? like new stuff?
[1:06:42] UnboundSouls: thats a paragraph PepoG
[1:06:47] RlDennis: @Darkaros That kind of stuff scares me monkaS I just haven't played ranked in years, and used to be mid-high diamond. if I start in bronze again all I'm gonna get is 'smurf' monkaS
[1:06:55] houseofdodo: Maybe the account sellers are gone
[1:06:59] dreamonb: hate smurfs
[1:07:00] thecynicalshuffler: wall of txt crits chat
[1:07:08] Playful_Fellow: @Gorn_Vernaleer well dota is ofc the OG, basically was carbon copy of dota 1, but not have evolved over time. LoL, is like dota/moba lite. So.. yeah I stand straight on that opinion. ;)
[1:07:09] ワフルデラ: 3 months I think
[1:07:11] egaszinaf: there was a crazy patch this year yeah in dota 2
[1:07:12] Xflame: yep, New Frontiers update was massive
[1:07:16] SixPointFive: Their seasons are a lot more variable than league, I feel
[1:07:18] zerohour_88: icefrog actively keeps the players on their toes by changing everything
[1:07:19] Hundisilm: I looked at esports earning website today - its like all just dota :/
[1:07:22] Killian_Hart: i feel like the paragraph spacing in twitch chat is really shit for long messages
[1:07:29] Hundisilm: I suppose League structure is different
[1:07:32] Killian_Hart: its genuinely hard to read blocks of text
[1:07:36] Xflame: 40% bigger, new neutral structures, new hero type
[1:07:36] Darkaros: Currently Dota players are Madge that Valve, alongside the smurf ban, publicly decided that they're no longer tying whale-fodder-MTX to their competitive scene prize pools to focus on making the game better
[1:07:41] RlDennis: @Hundisilm Franchised, salary
[1:07:44] m3lm4n: esports earnings is just tournament money
[1:07:46] ReginaldXIV: I'd play Dota 2 if they added a surrender button. I don't want to play 60 minute matches
[1:07:47] Darkaros: So the next TI prize pool is so smol
[1:07:54] zerohour_88: yeah, its by design, TI got too bloated
[1:07:56] LeelandGrant: Purge did an 9 hour stream on all the changes LUL
[1:08:06] Nootrishus: first time TI prize is lower than worlds
[1:08:06] houseofdodo: We do have a suurender button now
[1:08:16] ReginaldXIV: They do?
[1:08:25] houseofdodo: but you need to be a full team and jusst accept the surrender
[1:08:33] nimrickz: league?
[1:08:34] UnboundSouls: lego stream ijpSIP
[1:08:37] Hundisilm: Still the TI prize pools are sort of insane so far
[1:08:39] BlueSapphyre: Joms.
[1:08:40] javidesign95: i going to play cyberpunk with katana and knife in very hard
[1:08:41] zerohour_88: I never give up in Dota, either we win or we make the opponent earn their win and hate themselves
[1:08:43] Hmakk: Joms
[1:08:46] SchnellBier: lego Joms
[1:08:46] Ebra: WhyWontYouJoms
[1:08:47] Heisuisui: Joms

[1:14:37] ワフルデラ: doesn't that mean you have to reupload the stream?
[1:14:38] Darkaros: Sam got it setup after he got sufficiently harassed by his friends
[1:14:39] Ahoy_NATO: Caedrel has it. I think Tarik does too

[1:16:10] Darkaros: We're watching Strippin play before we (maybe? probably?) queue with him in League of Legends.
[1:16:10] dasmex: wait who is sam playing?

[1:20:07] ReginaldXIV: I blind picked Rakan in ranked and have like 60% win rate with him now lol
[1:20:33] egaszinaf: league has a load of broken heroes that they cant fix unless they chance some abilties, it makes me laugh everytime
[1:20:39] Theawesomesoccer2: im more a fire sol enjoyer
[1:20:57] RlDennis: Rakan's also a mainstay in pro play
[1:21:00] Boshean: just so hungry for kills
[1:21:01] basstieon: ...Sam stripF
[1:21:04] ReginaldXIV: Bronze wars

[2:27:29] jmj1987: wideVIBE
[2:27:31] Gorn_Vernaleer: kinda fascinating that we still play a 14 year old game and that A LOT of people play it still

[2:29:18] itmeBOT: As of September 2023 JP actively plays a lot of Karthus, ASol, Jhin, MF, and Trist. In the past he's played a lot of Trundle, Tahm Kench, Garen, Amumu, Kayle, Mundo, Kai'Sa and Malphite; and has played a bit but doesn't generally like Teemo, Irelia, Darius, Ashe, and Xayah
[2:29:23] Columnedarc: we were doing DRAGON things lmao
[2:29:24] Gorn_Vernaleer: @Miros__ true, it is fascinating in those cases too

[2:30:53] mii_irl: getting krunk like its 2002
[2:30:56] RlDennis: I'd assume if he likes infinite stacking, Veigar would work well. Ahri is pretty simple overall with decent survivability

[2:32:09] Yuvu5: Or people are coming back to the game after a long time cause the worlds hupe
[2:32:09] ScottishLewis: hasn't NA sever pop been slowly declining for years?

[3:00:48] THE_BBP: @itmeJP mastery means absolutely nothing in ALL GAMES. it only means they know where there buttons are most of the time
[3:00:48] XIIIthHour: He's been playing Garen since Launch, he still only has half a braincell, but he's playing a loooong time
[3:00:53] RVIII: the gold in this game is shockingly close
[3:01:03] Skyform: top lane? doing something useful?
[3:01:06] dasmex: couldn't be him the 1,5m mp garen

[3:06:53] Darkaros: @Niethil @Niethil Funny enough, the one time I played "real" moba smite that happened. I was just clueless in a solo lane and meanwhile the enemy team self-destructed KEKW

[3:08:46] sudden1mpakt: what server is this
[3:08:50] 14neo: @yellgler ohh, i am of the opinion that Dota 2 is easier for new players. for example, can't see your teammate and enemy ability descriptions in LoL, but you can in Dota 2
[3:08:52] Columnedarc: he's had years of being carried
[3:09:00] 14neo: ^that is, within a match
[3:09:05] Boshean: This is the League of Legends US server i believe @sudden1mpakt
[3:09:05] ScottishLewis: thats a good shout actually RlDennis
[3:09:08] Darkaros: for all we know they played a billion games in s1 when crit garen didn't sound dogshit, took a break, and ran it down ranked
[3:09:10] HaasGaming: Aren't there a lot of Garen bots in silver just farming accounts?

[4:03:28] Teguvan: No not at all.
[4:03:30] Mhik_vi: iy can bne
[4:03:40] evilperry: @itmeJP try to use the dematerializer twice on the cast er minions, helps you push the lane faster
[4:04:00] Tpocket: catBOP
[4:04:04] PoeticTromboneWaifu: @Andareas It is an incredible game, with lots of complexity. It is however a competitive game with none of the real world benefits of competiton (like comraderie, teamwork, etc) and all of the downsides
[4:04:12] evilperry: Annnd he used on the cannon without need
[4:04:13] Mhik_vi: i  mostly play arams i mean i wouldnt know
[4:04:15] PoeticTromboneWaifu: And so in most cases it fucking sucks

[4:04:37] Debazor: Who’s that champ facing JP?
[4:04:37] Nathanisms: is ASol not an early tear champion anymore?

[4:05:13] Debazor: I didn’t recognize him in that skin XD
[4:05:14] Nathanisms: @evilperry Last time I played it was an early tear purchase until RoA then selling the tear
[4:05:40] PoeticTromboneWaifu: @Andareas It gets worse. It also has all of the benefits without responsibility. Which sounds great because you go 12/0 and feel like a god, but it's so easy to attribute to your own ego
[4:06:23] WarOath: NOOO
[4:06:37] Andareas: rip points
[4:06:39] evilperry: @Nathanisms it doestn help here that he skipped catalyst

[4:08:38] FluffyDK: @Extrafun enjoy playing with people a lot better than you and learn from them
[4:08:39] evilperry: Seriously, his lane could have gone much better with good use of the minion dematerializer
[4:09:03] Omakie: im sorry @14neo but ive already lost faith
[4:09:10] evilperry: He just used on 3 cannons without thought
[4:09:13] beNamunous: veigar has so much swag
[4:09:37] 14neo: @Omakie oh no, you betted against and have been winning gambas so far ijpMONKA
[4:09:49] Skyform: they do or because xin backed they went for rift
[4:09:50] OuroborosChemist: who needs ward when you have map awarness
[4:09:53] WarOath: Just map control and awareness
[4:10:09] shadez1: are you compesating for something with this hero sizes ?
[4:10:12] Skyform: or just lucky. which is more likely
[4:10:24] OuroborosChemist: see some1 on some lane-> project their movements for 30-2mins after that
[4:10:32] morinoak: yeah starting rift when your mid is backed usually gonna be a bad time
[4:10:50] FluffyDK: @morinoak mid and top :P
[4:10:56] MorbidMorus: I mean strippin also showed they were top side with that gank, so they don't lose anything from checking herald
[4:10:57] Skyform: veigar juked like he saw it coming. they got some nice wards

[4:15:55] k0jak: someone pointed out to me that it sounds like the guy is saying pokemon in this song and that's all i hear now

[4:16:10] kelvar93: @kelvar93 I mean sure, but that's a big IF to rely upon
[4:16:11] egaszinaf: i guess MR is a big counter to this Sol
[4:16:13] Skyform: renek might scale off but he's not right now
[4:16:16] RlDennis: Well, the more they just allow you to hit with your Q, the more stacks you get @itmeJP
[4:16:19] 14neo: they did take some, just not enough to murderize peepoSad
[4:16:20] Skyform: it's gonna be tought

[4:24:29] egaszinaf: its kind of a red flag
[4:24:34] ScottishLewis: very small sample size for game to be fair
[4:24:38] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: yeah that a smurf account
[4:24:40] kelvar93: Tear > Rod > Rylai's > Archangel, is his core build
[4:24:53] RlDennis: Dunno, seems normal to me tbh. Could've just been playing normals after being scarred for life in Season 10

[4:25:43] Knight978: isnt this the song ziz always used to play
[4:25:57] egaszinaf: @RVIII with a lot of 100% win rate heroes? that doesnt sound normal
[4:25:57] MonkeyFormelyKnownAsDew: you look like your getting sniped
[4:25:59] RlDennis: I'd just chalk it up to them having become better at the game over the last 3 years and only now is starting to play ranked again
[4:26:24] DaJMasta: he's taken a hit of copium
[4:26:31] Noytron: coffee buff might go hard

[4:31:39] TylerDrake1790: Ours is more of just a harvest celebration thing
[4:31:42] Hager6025: Give thanks
[4:31:45] DaJMasta: americans need to be thankful once in a while Kappa
[4:31:47] k0jak: ye ye ye ye yeah
[4:32:00] Eaterofsocks: Why does any culture have a harvest festival? In Canada we have a terrible history with the first nations same as the US. So we celebrate it with turkey.
[4:32:02] Brytice: Yes, it's Canadian Thanksgiving, it's not a massive holiday like it is in the states, we just eat turkey and have a day off usually
[4:32:06] cryogeneric: oof sylas gonna be anoying early
[4:32:12] cryogeneric: but you scale, he does not
[4:32:15] Gat0rCh0mp: that lore line in the middle...
[4:32:23] chrisgodsman: Wait this is some serious copyright shit. How JP plays such music?
[4:32:39] GrimHawkGaming: our thanksgiving is based on a different history. Its literally just giving thanks for the bounties life has given us and not a historical event.
[4:32:41] cryogeneric: @chrisgodsman no vod's, no proof
[4:32:43] TylerDrake1790: @14neo stripHug i give torkey
[4:32:54] Darkaros: New GAMBA I'm going back to food prep bye
[4:32:56] moist_heinous: @chrisgodsman OBS can split the music so it doesn't show up on vod
[4:32:57] kelvar93: No mages are good! According to Demacia at least
[4:33:03] MorbidMorus: I'm on whatever side Garen is on
[4:33:28] cryogeneric: every enemy you hit with any ability grants stack
[4:33:31] MorbidMorus: it's Q
[4:33:33] Zyntho: Last hit + champs
[4:33:35] cryogeneric: every champion*
[4:33:40] cryogeneric: last hit Q for more stacks
[4:33:44] Hagaroth: Everytime you hit an enemy with any skill it stack
[4:33:46] Zyntho: Q hits 2 aswell
[4:33:50] cryogeneric: and W gets 10% cdr every 50 stacks
[4:33:50] Brytice: @itmeJP All abilities that hit champions give a stack, Q last hits also give stacks
[4:33:54] Lindobu: they changed him now everything gives you stacks
[4:33:56] AKraftyBasterd: @kelvar93 sounds like Sith thinking to me
[4:34:05] Daemerius: EZ free stacks

[4:34:16] The_Faceless_Void: EZ stacks
[4:34:19] RVIII: 3 stacks pre minions, ez game
[4:34:26] Galoari: i put everything on W
[4:34:28] The_Faceless_Void: Im glad to see Joms is on after work
[4:34:30] VikingHavan: is the follow button broken for anyone else?
[4:34:34] Hagaroth: JP I should advise to put your E not on autocast
[4:34:48] Lindobu: EZ 5 AP
[4:35:04] itmeBOT: Join our public Discord! discord.gg/itmejp
[4:35:05] egaszinaf: is JP counting on irish luck from this skin?
[4:35:26] Zyntho: NODDERS
[4:35:29] ReDliner8k: when u first time a champ always count on luck
[4:35:35] aceofspades3018: oh no we got dark JP. :)
[4:35:52] TORIwoo: dont farm with W
[4:35:54] Zyntho: cannons give more stacks
[4:35:56] TORIwoo: no stacks
[4:35:56] Craneston: dont use w for one minion. gives no stacks
[4:36:00] evilperry: The classic, lose to a champ, play the champ
[4:36:05] Lindobu: you wanna kill creeps with Q only
[4:36:07] Manse06: Farm with Q, stacks 1 AP per CS
[4:36:12] Lindobu: everything else is for champs
[4:36:19] evilperry: Q on the minions, W and the second part of Q on the enemy
[4:36:25] evilperry: to maximize stacks
[4:36:50] k0jak: yooo
[4:36:56] k0jak: catJAM
[4:37:00] 14neo: @evilperry ohh, so if possible have the Q from a creep bounce onto enemy champ eh?
[4:37:05] Raynemx: I'm loving this Blackpink marathon
[4:37:07] Raynemx: stripDance
[4:37:08] evilperry: @14neo Yes, exactly
[4:37:16] CAPTJADASHA: Jp scared of the enemy I see LUL LUL LUL
[4:37:18] evilperry: So you get the stack from the creep and from hitting him
[4:37:38] k0jak: jp is indeed a blink
[4:37:47] The_Faceless_Void: LUL
[4:37:55] WarOath: Worth
[4:38:11] evilperry: @itmeJP Put the cage on yourself, so it cancels his dash
[4:38:20] Raynemx: @k0jak based
[4:38:25] Hagaroth: The advantage of playing veigar is you get to stay don't worry im late game and be always right
[4:38:34] Hagaroth: say*
[4:38:40] k0jak: gotta get him on that midzy life tho
[4:38:57] AlphaMetal: He already threw it
[4:38:57] Lindobu: not even close baby
[4:38:59] WarOath: He used it
[4:39:02] cryogeneric: he used it
[4:39:10] evilperry: Gotta cage earlier, so you fuck his combo
[4:39:18] Hagaroth: You can see if Sylas has stocked an ult
[4:39:50] Ebra: jomsDED
[4:39:50] evilperry: You combo'ed wrong too
[4:39:55] sudden1mpakt: its over
[4:39:58] sudden1mpakt: gg
[4:39:59] Lindobu: jomsDED
[4:39:59] Knight978: lol

[4:40:06] revroom: ijpF1 ijpF2 ijpF3
[4:40:10] evilperry: Its W + Q + R
[4:40:16] CAPTJADASHA: Auto him?
[4:40:17] Xinder88: A good Sylas is so annoying
[4:40:17] egaszinaf: sometimes i dont get out low hp heroes are so hard to kill
[4:40:19] 14neo: WhyWontYouJoms SILVER SIEGE WhyWontYouJoms
[4:40:27] ZeusLair: his W is his trade win "lifesteal" so gotta try and trade when he uses it to clear minions
[4:40:37] Galoari: yeah the rotation was off there , otherwise it would have been a clean kill
[4:40:37] moist_heinous: WhyWontYouJoms SILVER SIEGE WhyWontYouJoms
[4:40:42] evilperry: @egaszinaf Sylas has tons of sustain, so he heals a lot
[4:41:03] egaszinaf: @evilperry i didnt notice heals
[4:41:05] evilperry: @itmeJP Cage on yourself, farm
[4:41:13] Lindobu: yeah cage yourself
[4:41:15] Hagaroth: Just farm you don't care about anything else
[4:41:23] evilperry: @egaszinaf When he hit JP, he healed for like 100 hp
[4:41:32] evilperry: That was his W
[4:41:48] OuroborosChemist: i feel veigar is like caster version of nasus just afk farm till lvl 11 or  something unless something low risk floats your way
[4:41:50] egaszinaf: @evilperry i meant with strippin
[4:42:02] Xinder88: Crown might be good this game to survive the burst
[4:42:05] RVIII: 75 stacks at 9 isnt bad tho, right?
[4:42:07] evilperry: Oh yeah, didnt pay attention to Sam fighting him
[4:42:31] evilperry: But sylas has sustain only, grievous wounds mess him up
[4:42:38] egaszinaf: @evilperry that is why i found it weird, i could not understand if i missed something

[4:43:36] evilperry: Remember, CAGE ON YOURSELF
[4:43:49] Lindobu: hitting him with q is still stacks
[4:43:49] egaszinaf: he is playing his lane right
[4:43:51] Zyntho: Q him gains just as much
[4:43:51] Lindobu: just not gold
[4:43:55] cryogeneric: just keep hitting sylas with Q if he blocks, still gives stacks
[4:43:57] Xinder88: You get stacks hitting him too. So he’s doing a bad job lol
[4:43:58] evilperry: The cage cancels dashes, if he loses the dash he is stuck
[4:44:01] Raynemx: wideVIBE straight to your dome like wow wow wow
[4:44:06] k0jak: god the bass synth on this song
[4:44:25] Daemerius: EZ

[4:44:37] evilperry: always finish with ult
[4:44:39] Killian_Hart: just lost a game because out mid and top decided that it was a good time to split when the enemy had baron
[4:44:44] evilperry: it does more damage the less hp he has

[4:45:12] Columnedarc: hopefully this skin gives us good luck too
[4:45:28] mynameisbebop: nooo
[4:45:31] mynameisbebop: dont ever front
[4:45:38] mynameisbebop: ludens is the best item for veigar.
[4:45:42] k0jak: thi ssong loses me here tbh
[4:45:45] k0jak: too many ratatatas
[4:45:49] mynameisbebop: due to magic pen being busted on him.
[4:45:55] evilperry: Meh, the best veigar item is the tank one that slows
[4:45:55] Galoari: i like the ratatatas
[4:45:57] DaJMasta: should at least evolve some of them @k0jak
[4:45:59] Xinder88: @mynameisbebop crown is good this game
[4:46:05] cryogeneric: @mynameisbebop frost is still good if he has to keep people off him
[4:46:07] Xinder88: Sylas burst
[4:46:08] epicshoo: meh this whole song was just not good
[4:46:16] evilperry: You can go full tank items and still win the burst
[4:46:16] k0jak: yeah i think it's mostly bad
[4:46:21] egaszinaf: @k0jak maybe he is a pokemon shepherd of ratatas
[4:46:24] k0jak: but that bass synth keeps it solid for me
[4:46:24] ashla11: are you sure you didnt steal my playlist today
[4:46:26] MadWikked: Nilah smurf? stripAYO
[4:46:34] WaywornCypress: Is that the Garen that was in your game awhile ago?
[4:46:38] mynameisbebop: @cryogeneric the idea is that if you play ludens enough you'll learn to space your cage and q's
[4:46:39] evilperry: Gotta dodge the Q so crown has value
[4:46:53] Hagaroth: When you play veigar and the ennemy didn't win by 20 minutes you basically won
[4:46:55] MarauderPL: Crown is good this game, I'd go for mpen boots tho
[4:47:09] Daemerius: EZ Clap

[5:01:24] Archangel3003: Guitar Hero 5 added a in Hard mode and above that you had to strum without pressing any notes and that just ruined it for me as I couldn't play higher than Normal and it was boring.
[5:01:26] Tnose: kayn jungle for sure
[5:01:29] Tnose: could be malz top
[5:01:40] estebanstrangiato: such a good song
[5:01:41] 14neo: funny feesh - does Fizz counter Viegar or does Viegar counter Fizz? ijpHMM
[5:01:49] Archangel3003: My brain couldn't process strumming and not pressing a button after all the years playing Rock Band and Guitar Hero
[5:01:55] Duo245: Can fizz still top?
[5:01:56] omgitsjason: that sucks for illaoi

[5:02:34] jeffhunter12: fought a really strong ahri top recently
[5:02:34] Baludor: I feel like Illaoi should dunk on Malz but this is Silver so who knows
[5:02:38] jwm31103: illoi hates both tbh
[5:02:57] Zathras: @Baludor if malz is half decent illaoi gets dunked on
[5:02:57] Tnose: both are brutal for illaoi, veigar probably manageable if she goes Q max
[5:03:37] Eaterofsocks: His drill is the drill that will pierce the sky.
[5:03:43] ワフルデラ: I feel like I have to go all in with my 250k to get PhilW in the emote stuff
[5:03:48] Zathras: also their malz has no flash

[5:05:09] knuxeh: It's just banger after banger pepeBASSHD
[5:05:27] evilperry: @itmeJP Remember to cage on your feet so you can cancel Fizz combo!
[5:05:50] Tnose: on paper, fizz beats veigar. But you're doing a good job, you just need to farm relatively defensively
[5:05:55] 14neo: @egaszinaf i guess it's all about who is quicker on the draw eh? 🔫 KKona
[5:06:12] Lindobu: it all bo9ils down to later cause fizz is weak af in early
[5:06:20] egaszinaf: @14neo its a mexican stand off...
[5:06:27] evilperry: @Tnose Exactly, thats why he messed up the cage here
[5:06:28] shijimas79: you  dint   flash  dudr
[5:06:29] shadow__rain: From what I’ve understood playing against fizz is bait his leap with your w then trap him with the circle
[5:06:39] Tnose: @evilperry to be fair, it was Sam's idea LUL
[5:06:43] Lt_Sharp: FUNNI FEESH is the best
[5:06:53] glasonidas: 7 ads is alot, jeeez
[5:06:57] riduY: does Sam not stream his Silver Sieges anymore
[5:07:00] egaszinaf: @Tnose at a certain point fizz loses the advantage if he doesnt just own the lane
[5:07:05] OuroborosChemist: this fish stays pretty forward so we could just q him all day long?
[5:07:06] Zathras: as long as you dont R before fizz has gone up on his pole youll do fine

[5:07:20] brewerdc: catJAM
[5:07:30] evilperry: @OuroborosChemist if he goes too forward Fizz can just all win him, and Fizz wants that
[5:07:36] evilperry: *all in
[5:07:37] Tnose: @egaszinaf Yep! That's why he's gotta just be defensive and wait to get to that point
[5:07:45] sudden1mpakt: let that wave kill the creeps
[5:08:19] OuroborosChemist: @OuroborosChemist range is good enough to hit fiz with only getting hit by dash part of his combo
[5:08:22] egaszinaf: @Tnose i know my tactics stripAYO

[5:38:57] MechaKuuga: The infighting begins
[5:38:57] Hairaldan: you have 2 inhibs.. they are really slow at pushing
[5:38:59] cryogeneric: 2 inhibs down, they can't push all 3 lanes
[5:39:03] Hairaldan: at least go bot and siege :D
[5:39:05] Ionbound: Did they change Malz's W again?

[5:39:46] CupCakesofChaos: should have just ended
[5:39:47] Adept_Zeno: He doesnt mean it!
[5:39:47] GuardianAngelz: you win, if you had ended the game 7 minutes ago. KEKW
[5:39:47] riduY: maybe the enemy team will also be bad and not end?
[5:39:48] RVIII: they did engage that fight
[5:39:50] Ebra: AAAA bronze wars AAAA
[5:39:52] Skyform: you died to baron
[5:39:52] Rezzak77: you win by going back like 10 mins and hit the nexus instead of getting top
[5:39:55] Hagaroth: Mind I remind than sam ask you to help him take the top inhib rahter than take the nexus
[5:39:56] beNamunous: hmmmmm
[5:39:56] egaszinaf: this should teach you both, end the games when the opportunity comes

[5:40:05] Duo245: Jp is right here
[5:40:10] OuroborosChemist: would't have been bad engage if all squishies werent tanking in the front
[5:40:13] Nirofen: Tragic
[5:40:19] CptCrotty: 100% JP right
[5:40:23] MysticXIII_: damn :/
[5:40:24] MarauderPL: Baron doesn't give any stats
[5:40:26] PoeticTromboneWaifu: I mean seraphine was way up compared to illaoi
[5:40:26] ReginaldXIV: Seraphine ulted into the grass again is why you lost the fight
[5:40:28] PureHonk: how did that game go from 11-1 to this
[5:40:29] TylerDrake1790: We still standing @itmeJP NODDERS
[5:40:33] GuardianAngelz: @MarauderPL baron gives crit.
[5:40:38] Skyform: seraphine actually threw that game twice
[5:40:42] Creakly: Still Standing JP
[5:40:43] Darkaros: jomsLife I'm still standing jomsLife
[5:40:50] 14neo: i can't believe Omakie got away with that again ijpD
[5:40:51] azure_savage_: Doesn't matter how good the buff is the other team had a good buff
[5:40:54] ReginaldXIV: Seraphine missed the ult
[5:40:58] MarauderPL: What? Crit?
[5:40:58] RuiFr: biggest throw was not ending though
[5:40:59] Gat0rCh0mp: because as good as illaoi was she backed cause she saw her shinny 3k+ gold instead of staying to end
[5:40:59] Broxalar: Big thing is they weren’t pushed in; you can stand back a bit more and wait it out, all your lanes were still pushed up so it was ok to give a little ground
[5:41:02] TylerDrake1790: @Darkaros WhyWontYouJoms get up
[5:41:14] GuardianAngelz: 100% lost cause ya'll didn't end the game when you had the chance.
[5:41:14] ReginaldXIV: Not ending is always the hard throw
[5:41:14] Skyform: seraphine budget KDA
[5:41:26] RlDennis: JP is right yeah. Just had to wait it out. @itmeJP I think one thing that you might look at is using your cage to seperate the enemy from their team. Make it hard for the backline members to move forward.
[5:41:28] beNamunous: If I talk Im in big trouble Joms
[5:41:35] Rezzak77: yes
[5:41:37] 14neo: @AinzN oh just saw dis - definitely didn't ijpNODDERS
[5:41:40] RlDennis: Not necessarily for that game. Because Nilah was in front. but yeah
[5:41:40] Hairaldan: when they have baron and your scared of them to split up (1 3 1).. then let them and force a fight on 3, not all 5.. JP is right, there was no reason to fight there :D
[5:41:41] GuardianAngelz: you only needed the one inhib to end it..
[5:41:43] LeweK92: you dont need the 2nd inhib
[5:41:49] Mrshilka: p5JAM p5JAM p5JAM
[5:41:49] Gat0rCh0mp: didnt need 2nd inhib, yeah. just the mid one and if illoai stayed you just end
[5:41:52] RuiFr: didnt need the 2nd innib yeah

[5:42:33] Hagaroth: I know jp got Fizz ptsd but if he lane against zed that will be pain
[5:42:33] RlDennis: I'm kind of surprised the Illaoi didn't push bot lane when they had baron. it was the only lane that wasn't auto pushing because of supers
[5:42:44] ArcaneSyntax: WE GET UP it's the precursor to a cum song
[5:42:45] MuzzyBeast98: stripDance stripBurn stripDance

[5:42:51] Krazedirish: Carry on my wayward sunnnn.  That song always remind me of when I binged Supernatural. I heard that shit every final episode.
[5:42:54] Daemerius: You gotta Joms
[5:42:54] SirBabelt: Well, learning to end the game comes with experience, and even if you know when you have the chance, it might be hard to lead the rest of the team into ending too
[5:43:15] Skyform: WhyWontYouJoms
[5:43:24] omgitsjason: WhyWontYouJoms
[5:43:25] GuardianAngelz: @Krazedirish nah, Supernatural was good even through the end - got the ending that was deserved. My opinion <3
[5:43:25] SirBabelt: Gotta take the L's to learn from them I guess
[5:43:37] ToastyPotato: Joms might as well Joms

[5:44:17] PoeticTromboneWaifu: Isn't that illegal
[5:44:19] gonelinkdead: It was a planned exit
[5:44:20] Nogardknight: Of course
[5:44:22] ワフルデラ: but 2m worth?
[5:44:23] Killian_Hart: i hate that they keep getting away with it
[5:44:24] Hagaroth: It was planned
[5:44:25] Krazedirish: @GuardianAngelz Huh, for sure. I loved it. It was good memories. I just remember hearing it and being hyped. Because I binged it so hard
[5:44:27] WarOath: Probably started selling when they came up with the plan
[5:44:31] DobbsjustDobbs: He still has over 1 million shares

[5:44:35] omgitsjason: JomsBusiness seems legit
[5:44:36] Mrshilka: if they can prove it its illegal
[5:44:36] Darkaros: JomsBusiness I'm crashing this company. With no survivors.
[5:44:37] Hairaldan: its called insider trading
[5:44:37] DobbsjustDobbs: He only sold like 1% of them
[5:44:40] Nogardknight: Like, every trash CEO ever
[5:44:41] moist_heinous: if he sold them all at once thats alot of taxes
[5:44:42] Baludor: He's a piece of shit but it's only 1% of his shares
[5:44:44] SirBabelt: Rich people dont need to follow the laws tho
[5:44:44] NordanAnter: classic pump and dump capitalism clioaiDead
[5:44:46] RlDennis: @PoeticTromboneWaifu Usually it's not. Just shows no trust in the company. He was problaby paid partially in shares
[5:44:50] Variandra: i missed wat company?
[5:44:51] Mrshilka: also Eddie Van Halen Pog
[5:44:52] Reductive_Reasoning: Stock market is always a scam for someone
[5:45:00] nakata545: It sounds like its just a dude getting shares as part of his contract and so he just sells it

[5:45:05] Urinater: Laws are for poor people
[5:45:18] Nathillion: The game was rigged from the start. Always will be.
[5:45:27] ToastyPotato: classic insider trading
[5:45:28] Kmehz: because they regularly offload shares before they do some shady shit then it doesn't look like manipulation
[5:45:32] Adept_Zeno: There an echo in here?
[5:45:37] gonelinkdead: JUMP
[5:45:40] lilbrown10: What company is this?
[5:45:41] Kmehz: even though you know it is
[5:45:47] WarOath: @Kmehz Yup
[5:45:47] omgitsjason: go ahead and catBOP
[5:45:51] SirBabelt: Every law that has a fine and not jail only matters to the poor
[5:45:54] KM0r: that's standard though.  they get paid in shares, let them sit to avoid short term gain taxes and then consistently trade them into cash at a lower tax rate than a "wage".
[5:45:55] DaJMasta: might as well Joms
