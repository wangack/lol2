[0:23:59] Lihapiiras: Higher powers are trying to tell not to watch the Mario review
[0:24:04] harb_id: You're still streaming because the DNS got resolved before something happened to it. Now it's running of the session it created earlier @itmeJP .
[0:24:05] Somebeardy: Someone didn't like you watching that review

[0:25:01] Zyntho: ye try 8.8.8.8
[0:25:01] Bustakapp_: Most likely a route issue between you and yt/google servers. Something regional
[0:25:03] ワフルデラ: Twitch nuked your internet cause you didn't go to Vegas
[0:25:10] thesestrangenotions: You can't, you wouldn't be able to search for airlines ijpKEK
[0:25:11] MrGein_182: Go into your router and change DNS there
