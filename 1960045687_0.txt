[0:14:02] copycoffeecat: I despise the political right with their culture war so much
[0:14:04] NinjaPandaEU: but that was forseeable since these people called spider-man woke for a while
[0:14:07] hoosierJ: starfield was woke, horizon was woke, BG3 was woke
[0:14:12] DaRandalizer: lalalalalal not listening

[0:15:25] Madracah: Cray Cray
[0:15:27] Mergr: it's the sme crowd that rail at disney for making marvel woke , when the comics had a political column since the 60s. They never read teh comics. it's just chud mindworms
[0:15:33] Julia: i want to slap people who use the word "woke" in the face to wake them up danJulia but i dont condone violence

[0:15:39] Drackmatv: Hey JP, planning another 14 hour day of Moira?
[0:15:42] RlDennis: Apparently they used gender neutral language in spanish @itmeJP
[0:15:45] Dr4gonb0rn_: they changed words to be gender neutral
[0:15:48] BlazeRom: I felt no wokeness or politics in Spider-Man 2
[0:15:50] BlazeRom: weird
[0:15:58] Daggial: spanish is gender based language and the devs changed the words to be gender neutral
[0:15:58] Sonatta: Spanish has gender specific words and there are people making up non-binary words to change the language @itmeJP
[0:16:00] itmeBOT: If you're enjoying the stream, click the Follow button to be notified when JP goes live!
[0:16:04] BlazeRom: Aaaah in spanish
[0:16:10] JonnyFiveO: Is that because spiderman is anti-gun or something?
[0:16:10] Cygnatus: i think they did it in a clunky way
[0:16:11] SlipCrit: These people have too much time
[0:16:12] synthetik666: yea maybe im just not looking for it, but where was the wokeness in spidey 2 lol
[0:16:12] thaprinnydood: oh yeah that is bad
[0:16:14] Cygnatus: iirc
[0:16:15] Stealthsuit25: They invented spanish words for gender-natural
[0:16:16] Pariston_Hill: Latinx
[0:16:17] Sonatta: using A and O in words
[0:16:18] RlDennis: I guess?
[0:16:20] BlazeRom: people said they attempted to change their language

[0:16:38] Thedante1122: The change it whith "e"
[0:16:40] voidwarrantyTV: My biggest problem is the people who just need to find the "woke" agenda in everything.  These are the people who are ruining their passions and pass times for themselves, nothing more and nothing less.
[0:16:44] raptorscream: Romantic languages have gendered languages
[0:16:45] BlazeRom: KEKW
[0:16:45] StreamBonker: Yeah kinda like white people invented "Latinix" that everyone hates
[0:16:51] OuroborosChemist: @SixPointFive i never got the gender neutral controversy since my language lack 3rd person gender term

[0:17:10] BlazeRom: I'd blame it on the translation team
[0:17:15] Daggial: latin was gender based too, and neolatin languages are (i think)
[0:17:18] Sonatta: PepeLaugh
[0:17:19] NoordSz: I mean they also used Hungarian for Symkarian to avoid Russo languages @itmeJP
[0:17:20] Cygnatus: yeehaw

[0:17:45] icawn_: OMG
[0:17:48] NinthDemon: the argument is that noone that actually speaks spanish uses these neutral terms and it feels like a bastardization of the language by people who dont even speak it
[0:17:50] SixPointFive: @OuroborosChemist gender attached*
[0:18:05] Anterak: @Julia Well done ijpLAUGH

[0:19:37] IamTheRealDante: I haven't seen on web yet
[0:19:38] Darkaros: @IamTheRealDante 1) rude to discuss appearance 2) the genuine explanation is JP has sleep apnea and wears a CPAP mask that's smack dab on that red part
[0:19:48] Labott: @MrMoogleberry 30 mins I believe

[0:30:56] JeXus1985: the warhammer gamer in me cries a little. But it's true
[0:30:56] Major_J03: I'd say WH games were bad for a long time, but recently there are mostly good ones
[0:31:03] NinthDemon: you could say harry potter up until the latest game came out
[0:31:04] thesestrangenotions: peepoArrive third party partners? Hit me up with some RPGs now that jpn devs are onboard

[0:31:12] markbart1: i loved their mmo :(
[0:31:13] k0jak: i always prefer shotgun approach to content creation. make 1000 things of every IP. 990 of 'em will be bad, some of them will be gollumW bad. but you also will get a handful of 10/10s
[0:31:16] ThaSandus: theres maybe 10 in history that are worth something in warhammer LUL

[1:07:31] leovic1: do you have headphones on?
[1:07:32] cxselt: almost as if you're sitting at your desk, wow Pog
[1:07:32] UnboundSouls: the aspect ration is probably gonna be awful
[1:07:39] Drygyn: They won't
[1:07:42] KDogg241: apple lowering prices OMEGALUL
[1:07:43] BuffaloTheory: What sort of battery life do you get out of it?
[1:07:44] WDForty: apple? price down? ijpKEK
[1:07:44] Norrak1: Apple and price down, name an unlikely duo
[1:07:44] KingofJeans: @UnboundSouls Because we live in Idiocracy
[1:07:46] Orion3315: If it has a virtual keyboard that works really well, I'd be interested
[1:07:48] Dr4gonb0rn_: Apple get their price down KEKW
[1:07:49] simaryex: apple getting the price down, KEKW
[1:07:52] larkhill: @UnboundSouls seems a lot easier than buying 5 monitors
[1:07:57] Guts72: Doing multiple things like that just ruins the experience of the game imo
[1:07:59] Spirit_FM: i doubt they would get the price down
[1:08:03] Hmakk: dose newer vr headsets fix the eye pain and headaces?
[1:08:11] bubblebruise: im old my attention span couldnt handle it
[1:08:11] Darkaros: INSANECAT pov you have 10 monitors
[1:08:11] XxPhantom73xX: @muffinface__ probably the BTTV extension
[1:08:15] Redeyedmonster: 3 screen minimum or get out :)
[1:08:15] WDForty: but only boomers have the $$ to afford that shit
[1:08:17] Dr4gonb0rn_: would be cool ngl
[1:08:23] DaRandalizer: they might have a cheaper version in the works
[1:08:26] Norrak1: It's for zoomer priced for boomers
[1:08:28] CanadianEevee: monitor companies hate this one trick!
[1:08:33] Orion3315: My monitor cost 1100....so when you factor that in. Not ultra basd
[1:08:39] Orion3315: bad*
[1:08:39] Mishymac: I‚Äôm Gen X and I‚Äôm into the Minority Report ar setup
[1:08:40] Sophiaan31: Skill up was just talking on his podcast how it was incredibly cool to have a youtube vid playing in AR while doing the dishes blew his mind with the quest 3
[1:08:43] pc2400: remove the VR gaming component
[1:08:49] Xenflux: XR/VR desktops have been in the works for years
[1:08:55] BuffaloTheory: @XxPhantom73xX BTTV, yeah
[1:08:58] LIVECODING: i'm still holding out for 8K TV-as-monitor to be full 60Hz and full color range
[1:09:00] ashrifts: From an enterprise stand point it will never fly. So its not going to take off like people think
[1:09:01] Norrak1: But isnt the apple one like 3k?
[1:09:28] pc2400: huh
[1:09:31] cxselt: complete hot tub stream immersion NODDERS
[1:09:34] Redeyedmonster: 4 twitter tabs
[1:09:35] Sophiaan31: holy shit dude hah

[1:09:39] novafreez3: ddHuh
[1:09:44] gorlork: Won't the controller get wet HUHH
[1:09:44] MNmichael: that just seems like a media overload
[1:09:50] UnboundSouls: look at Mr Rich guys over here having a whole ass bathtub Smadge
[1:09:51] DobbsjustDobbs: But when do you wash yourself?
[1:09:54] MagnaCarter_: is it not laggy at all with all that?
[1:09:56] larkhill: if i didnt wear glasses, id probably enjoy VR a lot more
[1:09:56] Sophiaan31: you use hands
[1:09:59] Ebra: hand control
[1:10:09] gorlork: I meant that he was playing a game chat WeirdDude
[1:10:09] copycoffeecat: how do you wash your hair / face though?
[1:10:27] eEKBAh: you can buy them for quest 2 as well. Replacement lenses
[1:10:32] FataltheBaptist: No dont do it
[1:10:44] Zuleyus: @LIVECODING I want those with about the same ppi as my 34" UW - give me work surface for days
[1:10:48] KingofJeans: that's pretty neat
[1:10:50] WDForty: when they get that tech into proper glasses and not a closed headset so there's no need for cameras for the real world, then i'll be excited
[1:10:51] SMonTwitch: cool
[1:10:53] RomulusSC2: the future, man
[1:10:54] MagnaCarter_: that's a crazy good price for prescription lenses
[1:10:54] Darkaros: honestly pretty reasonable price too
[1:10:56] Sir_RobsterRoll: for 50? that's great
[1:11:03] Jonathick: good price too
[1:11:07] writer13plays: that's pretty cool, worht the money
[1:11:09] Dreadwolf: yeah my lenses cost around 600$ that a bit rough
[1:11:09] Pagangods: i have a prism in my left lens , so i doubt they do that
[1:11:11] Laursi_: good price for prescription lenses
[1:11:13] LIVECODING: @Zuleyus 8k TVs are here! just not full color range yet. I think I'd also want it to be curved
[1:11:13] beararsed: wow, i bet youll get much more use out of this one :kappa:
[1:11:16] SZebra: I wonder if there is a UK equivalent.
[1:11:20] cxselt: are there offers like that for the index too? first time i'm seeing this
[1:11:21] Xenflux: @WDForty like Google Glass but able to run more than one app at a time
[1:11:25] WDForty: this is cool step in the right direction
[1:11:43] Woofric: They include a glasses spacer. But to be honest, you should just be looking to replace most of the components for better third party stuff when it's available.
[1:11:48] LIVECODING: @Zuleyus i mean last time i checked, the cables weren't high throughput enough to emit 8K 60Hz + full color range
[1:11:51] Orion3315: Can you link the Quest3 to SteamDeck? Might be a use case
[1:11:53] Zuleyus: @LIVECODING curved absolutely. just a surround workspace you can walk out of
[1:11:55] WDForty: @WDForty more like holo lens, but like 20 generational improvements
[1:11:58] SilverNiKr: ai I'd assume
[1:12:18] Kaleith: I've seen people do it but no idea how
[1:12:23] BlackholeYeti: that ark remaster is hitting steam today, according to the steam trailer, so that's neat
[1:12:30] Kaleith: maybe they put windows on the deck
[1:12:34] birkhoms: how does that work. via the facebook app?
[1:12:44] leovic1: probably install Virtual Desktop on the steam deck
[1:12:53] crawds: is xbox partner preview already over?
[1:13:04] Kaleith: crawds it was 28ish minutes
[1:13:04] birkhoms: you still gotta login into oculus and FB right?
[1:13:21] Woofric: You can use an app like Immersed to have it send your desktop to you over internet or Wifi.
[1:13:25] Norrak1: It's the same thing
[1:13:29] birkhoms: well there is basically no difference
[1:13:31] gorlork: Damn, I was excited until the meta account PepeHands
[1:13:38] espi: Alan Wokege
[1:13:41] thesestrangenotions: How much of the preview was after the fps game? I had to dip out

[1:14:24] gnartriip: JP you should try out WRC it looks like fun
[1:14:26] copycoffeecat: The Smurfs 2 is going to ruin all those games
[1:14:26] espi: not you JP, the Puzzler Kappa
[1:14:26] Zuleyus: supposedly the tracking is a bit less intense than the old FB links, but the Meta account is still my biggest issue with the Q3
[1:14:27] Ahoy_NATO: blizzcon gunna be gype, theyve been teasing D4 news
[1:14:27] Sprynx007: Do I need to read meta "scientific studies" daily so I can use the account for free? Kappa

Joms D Roger, the jomsKing of the jomsPirate s, attained this and everything else the world had to offer, and his dying words drove countless souls to League of Legends. "You want my LP? You can have it. I left everything I gathered together in one place, now you just have to find it".
