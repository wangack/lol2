[0:48:33] murasaur: errr, squadron 42
[0:48:34] Darkaros: Sadge I don't remember the blame twitch command of f the top of my head
[0:48:48] xarantur: Yeah its Barry's problem ijpKEK cause he has to figure out what's causing it and tell twitch about it
[0:48:52] Mallatom: did the grenade not go off?
[0:48:52] ErikThe_Viking: It is just that tjmiller1988 just have 10 tabs gifting one at a time, just 10times fast Kappa
[0:48:53] Shin_gx: !blameshower Darkaros ijpKEK
[0:48:54] Annilalate: It's not a you problem, JP, there's another user who triggers the same issue for another streamer I watch
[0:48:58] cyberronic: this looks quite boring tbh
[0:48:59] Lihapiiras: @Hundisilm  Add? Has been in the game since first betas.
[0:48:59] VathosGaming: Thanks. Only 20 years in the making or so it seems
[0:49:02] Miros__: We are all getting old Sadge
[0:49:03] afreak10: BB guns ?
[0:49:08] Zuleyus: TJ just wants to hear more subby whore, but the rng is so bad on Barry's apps
[0:49:14] SMonTwitch: Dr4gonb0rn_ is this is a sandbox rpg? Thought it was a linear storyline in the space sim. Good to know, regardless don't see the point in comparison. Hopefully it's enjoyable regardless
[0:49:36] Orion3315: I always find it strange when someone demonstrates an FPS sequence, but moves slowly for cinematic effect.
[0:49:39] DocOakum: It's a video for people who already know the project, doesn't feel like a real trailer
[0:49:49] TylerSouth88: he's talking about the updates over the past year.
[0:49:52] nessopito: seems... curated
[0:50:02] ワフルデラ: it's more of like a progress report cause Star Citizen was crowd funded right?
[0:50:08] cyberronic: wow... you press F... groundbreaking
[0:50:09] gorlork: They animated the game? Pog
[0:50:10] murasaur: not quite really a traailer, tho?
[0:50:13] writer13plays: nope, it's just another cutscene
[0:50:14] ワフルデラ: so they're just showing the crowd who invested the progress
[0:50:25] Bob__Z: They got really good, at making trailers
[0:50:28] cyberronic: @writer13_press0451 you mean... loading screen :D
[0:50:31] Miklagard: I belive it when It releases KEKW
[0:50:32] Annilalate: @ワフルデラ Crowd funded... and funded... and funded... and funded... and...
[0:50:34] NoordSz: How big will the game size be on a drive with all those animations and assets?
[0:50:46] BuffaloTheory: @NoordSz Yes
[0:50:56] gregreg: sac42PRIDE
[0:51:04] NoordSz: Glad we agree @BuffaloTheory
[0:51:05] Synlenia: oh I thought this was starfield
[0:51:06] nessopito: I'll start to believe when I see like a 20 minutes uninterrupted gameplay video
[0:51:06] ワフルデラ: @BuffaloTheory definitely more than 1 gig
[0:51:17] perkbrian: They should have done all the mocap with their webcam tech from Star Citizen.
[0:51:32] Synlenia: what game is this?
[0:51:38] BroqRox: YEP cockpit
[0:51:43] writer13plays: @cyberronic yes and no. if you want to be immersive and turn on something, don't make it a 5 sec animation. how about do what amnesia did, and not taking away the control from the player. :D
[0:51:47] epicshoo: YEP
[0:51:47] ProxyClouds: I'm really looking forward to seeing of the money I spent into Star Citizen was completely wasted or actually worth. If they can deliver on what they have been selling us for so many years it might be great.
[0:51:47] SBGorilla: No man's sky 2
[0:51:48] gregreg: bad guys
[0:51:51] murasaur: @NoordSz Star Citizen is currently sitting at 100+GB with only one system stripSuffer
[0:52:03] Darkaros: This is Star Citizen devs' singleplayer game Squadron 42
[0:52:04] Dr4gonb0rn_: I'll say it again (sorry!) - the Star Engine video demonstrates the scope and tech much better
[0:52:13] perkbrian: Gary Old Man
[0:52:13] writer13plays: chat take a shot every time you here immersive
[0:52:18] kvert2121: the comish!

[0:54:17] PelleBulldog: Mark Hamill was in Wing Commader
[0:54:21] writer13plays: I like that they did not de-age anybody here
[0:54:22] Radiag: he isnt in this trailer, but henry cavil also plays one of the pilots

[0:55:07] EightBitDelight: I doubt I'll play StarCitizen now as it's jsut to big but Squadron 42 seems fun
[0:55:08] gregreg: Davos
[0:55:08] Ton_E_Tone: GOOD LORD
[0:55:08] NercesK: Stacked
[0:55:09] telaos: but did they update how old everyone looks as the game takes longer and longer to release?
[0:55:10] Mallatom: did they spend a billion just on the cast?
[0:55:10] Ravnim: the onion knight

[0:55:13] SpriteShade: half the budget was for actors
[0:55:14] jooebeef: I see where all that money went
[0:55:14] MYGAMERTAG1: @itmejp found their budget
[0:55:14] SMonTwitch: well they had _a lot_ of money to spend on this JP
[0:55:16] gregreg: just make a movie already
[0:55:17] MagnaCarter_: how do they have money left for the devs!?
[0:55:17] Devlind: they have more money than they know what to do with
[0:55:18] Peardr0ps: This is where all the budget has gone I guess
[0:55:18] summerspeak: got to spend all that money on something
[0:55:18] crzymike: so many people!!!
[0:55:19] OptionalSuperboss: ok who isN'T in this game?
[0:55:19] DoNotPursueLuBu_: the story can't be bad if we buy every single actor known to man
[0:55:20] gregreg: that chick was famous too
[0:55:21] Synlenia: I mean star citizen has money for this right?
[0:55:22] ErikThe_Viking: Well.. they had to spend some of that money they have gotten on something LUL
[0:55:22] Lihapiiras: Holy F this cast

[0:55:23] ワフルデラ: yeah, they have like 144 million dude
[0:55:23] Orion3315: See if you can spot Andy Serkis. LUL It should be obvious
[0:55:25] oPH0EN1Xo: @itmejp is this one huge aprils fools?! So many big name actors
[0:55:27] kimba274: @Imbadyoureworse that's the goal. they want to make a modern wing commande
[0:55:32] RhodesToRome: None of these games are ever coming out guys
[0:55:35] Razzyingraz: man the graphics jump is pretty big
[0:55:35] perkbrian: I cant wait to see their faces at 15fps at graphics set to low!
[0:55:36] MagnaCarter_: @Orion3315 is he playing an alien?
[0:55:37] NoordSz: We just put all of Hollywood in here Kappa
[0:55:37] murasaur: guys, a lot of these people's mocap was done and captured in 2014 when the project was not at 600m
[0:55:37] chalando: Wow
[0:55:40] DaRandalizer: they moisturized!
[0:55:42] gorlork: Sadge
[0:55:44] epicshoo: waiting for cohh to show up as a random pilot
[0:55:45] Wumbologistmd: This story seems extremely dramatic.
[0:55:48] BuffaloTheory: @MagnaCarter_ He mocaps the ship
[0:55:51] telaos: better have sigourney weaver or nathan fillon lol
[0:55:55] ワフルデラ: @murasaur Kappa

[0:56:06] Arenthar: oh, its Scam Citizen
[0:56:11] afreak10: ijpWTF nice fps
[0:56:15] Mallatom: game gonna cost 150$ and you going to need 7090 TI to get 90 + frames KEKW
[0:56:18] gorlork: Why is it 20 fps HUH
[0:56:22] SlipCrit: Is this star citizen or like a side game?
[0:56:25] Burkody: That guy didn't even care that hose was moving through his feet
[0:56:27] MagnaCarter_: that guy didn't trip over the hose, not believeable
[0:56:28] Xflame: the Skylines experience
[0:56:28] WaystedMined: Because the game plays at 20 FPS w/ a super computer
[0:56:29] theoryops: they forgot to use a 4090
[0:56:30] LordSpudlington: side game
[0:56:33] Ton_E_Tone: Is this where all the money SC made is going? into a completely diffrent game? ijpKEK ijpKEK
[0:56:34] Annilalate: @epicshoo It ends up just being Garry the Prophet on his way to Alpha Centauri
[0:56:35] Dr4gonb0rn_: optimisation is yet to come
[0:56:36] SlipCrit: coxBut coxBut coxBut
[0:56:41] iilu: They haven't optimised yet
[0:56:41] ZcottD: they did say this is all before optimization
[0:56:43] Orion3315: @MagnaCarter_ yep
[0:56:46] Radiag: this is squadron 42, its the singleplayer campaign thats meant to lead into star citizen
[0:56:47] Dr4gonb0rn_: star engine 4.0 I think
[0:56:52] NoordSz: so let's see, 13 years of development means 2-3 years of polish then?
[0:56:55] Rakish44: this is what 90% of the Star Citizen devs have been up to all these years
[0:56:57] ワフルデラ: they forgot to add Frame Generation for the demo Kappa
[0:57:10] Bob__Z: Can’t wait for them to change the engine, again
[0:57:11] theoryops: how much did this cost to make... damn
[0:57:20] UltrawideGameGuy: This single player campaign is gonna be 4 super high quality hours!
[0:57:26] comfortcove: will it run on switch?
[0:57:33] AshLike: and fully funded
[0:57:34] TonnyWalker: If they release this and its just a walking movie game i wouldnt mind LUL
[0:57:35] fluffycatpaww: uh...
[0:57:37] boogerbomb01: Hes not wrong lol
[0:57:38] TickleTheCohh: NODDERS 600 mill
[0:57:44] afreak10: the most expensive failure if it will come out :P
[0:57:44] aeg5000: keep buying those ships.... LUL
[0:57:51] thisrogue: bless the whales sponsoring this LUL
[0:57:53] EightBitDelight: mostly crowdfunded right?
[0:58:00] bakavic: imagine this coming out to 6/10 reviews
[0:58:03] BaosilisK: TonnyWalker i mean they are selling it to be really linear and story driven so probably :)
[0:58:06] chalando: Hold your pinky to your mouth when you say it
[0:58:08] Orion3315: @thisrogue You get to see them in the tech demo
[0:58:09] murasaur: @EightBitDelight Mostly
[0:58:12] DocOakum: @afreak10 They're already funded, failing wouldn't be expensive for CIG
[0:58:12] Nabster15: which game is this?
[0:58:18] Darkaros: This is Star Citizen devs' singleplayer game Squadron 42
[0:58:20] gregreg: Squadron 42
[0:58:21] UltrawideGameGuy: Have a buddy who won't say how much he's spent on star citizen ships. We're guessing mid 6 figures...
[0:58:24] Nabster15: ok
[0:58:27] DaRandalizer: the server meshing stuff might be the most revolutionary of the engine
[0:58:36] Burkody: I mean you can shit on SC as much as you want, it looks amazing. Can't wait to see what it looks like when I'm 80 and releases
[0:58:38] ワフルデラ: I can't believe they spent 600m for a game we're gonna play for 30h and uninstall KEKW
[0:58:39] shadowoflight_: There's zero g you don't even need to do this lol
[0:58:47] countmarcula: flagging with a shotgun 😬
[0:58:48] murasaur: @Burkody Same
[0:58:50] LordSpudlington: @DaRandalizer that demo at citcon blew my mind
[0:58:55] DocOakum: KKona
[0:58:56] RhodesToRome: KKona hell yeah brother
[0:58:56] Radiag: @shadowoflight_ the ships have gravity gens
[0:58:56] EightBitDelight: Already seems more fun then Starfield hehe
[0:58:57] gorlork: KKona Hell yeah
[0:58:57] afreak10: KKona
[0:58:58] Mallatom: KKona my man
[0:58:58] gregreg: good, as long as i can kill my companions
[0:58:59] BaosilisK: KKona
[0:59:01] DarkRemnent: KKona
[0:59:06] Malahel: This guy fuks his guns
[0:59:19] UltrawideGameGuy: You don't? pshh
[0:59:19] murasaur: QTE yaaay
[0:59:21] DaRandalizer: @DaRandalizer yepp. took them long enough though
[0:59:25] WDForty: he pointed a loaded gun at you as he turned around
[0:59:26] AshLike: danDerp will this run on PS4 LUL
[0:59:27] Arenthar: F
[0:59:27] Malahel: real american
[0:59:29] SlipCrit: Does this have a character creator or only the main game?
[0:59:38] Reijm11: Still think this looks like a COD campaign
[0:59:43] gregreg: solid!
[0:59:52] Dr4gonb0rn_: why do devs always let shit players demo gameplay though - I'll never understand that
[0:59:58] Razzyingraz: QTE for gun jams... Why
[1:00:01] Orion3315: that looks nice
[1:00:02] woundedpoptart: SNIFFA
[1:00:03] thisrogue: ah yes i'd love weapon malfunction in my shooter game
[1:00:04] Mud__: SNIFFA
[1:00:05] Annilalate: I don't think anyone wants to be playing a game and have their weapon malfunction unexpectedly
[1:00:06] BaosilisK: lethal gas RIPBOZO
[1:00:09] Radiag: @SlipCrit yea, it does have a creator
[1:00:11] K_RAFF: Yeah thats exactly what I look forward to is real life gun jams
[1:00:12] Darkaros: SNIFFA
[1:00:19] Shin_gx: It kinda feels old in terms of game mechanics and animations sometimes, i guess it makes sense when it's been so long they've been doing it
[1:00:21] murasaur: @SlipCrit In theory, the game will allow you to bring your squadron42 made character into star citizen, currently SC does allow for a character creator, but its rudimentary
[1:00:22] SMonTwitch: SlipCrit I believe the main charachter is customizeable, the video earlier showed the voice lines being said by different looking MCs
[1:00:28] Peardr0ps: Found the Fumo guy  LUL
[1:00:30] SlipCrit: coxBut
[1:00:32] bambooooh: jamming weapons is pretty cool tho
[1:00:33] Jukettaja: Oh Gary is in this

[1:11:21] Bakanoodle: @ワフルデラ Given all they showed of the gameplay and the leaks etc, no way in hell it won't be a gacha. Now I have been an Arknights player since day 1, so if it's not a gacha I won't mind ofc, but still all things point to it being one

[2:00:20] gulox2: hey, thanks for the Spider-Man thoughts video, enjoyed it. I'm thinking any DLC might be related to the person from the Miles 'Unidentified Persons' quests and they might leave 'The Flame' character for the third game. (trying not to be too spoilery :D ) Might be an interesting story with that character as well.
[2:00:22] k0jak: @BuffaloTheory it's hulu in the US
[2:00:24] Xenflux: TV is easy, you start with Seinfeld and then work your way up to increasing levels of plot

[2:02:59] egaszinaf: are we Joms or what ? :D
[2:03:03] der_dritte: Definitely not watching that at a cinema.
[2:03:23] Archangel3003: I don't get that Five Nights film. Cause they made a horror game that got popular with kids and then just made a full blown horror movie, based on a franchise popular with kids who are likely too young to see it lol.
[2:03:23] ワフルデラ: isn't FNAF fanbase really young?
[2:03:27] andrej000006: saw on twitter a fight broke out at fnaf theatre
[2:03:29] thesestrangenotions: Price and time?

[2:03:47] BuffaloTheory: @ReginaldXIV Ooh speaking of Nic Cage, his new film 'Dream Scenario' looks amazing
[2:03:48] gorlork: Yes
[2:03:50] jmm548: yeah they are on game like 5 or 6 now so its been awhile
[2:03:51] ワフルデラ: I'd guess they'd be 15 max

[2:03:57] prfella: fnaf backstory is really dark
[2:04:04] Archangel3003: I still see kids in the place I work looking at those toys
[2:04:05] prfella: like the lore and such
[2:04:07] JonnyFiveO: My friends kids are all about FNAT and they are like 10 years old.
[2:04:14] thesestrangenotions: FNAF hit a spread of ages with the first one. If the movie was halfway decent they could have nabbed more groups
[2:04:15] markbart1: id say 13-20
[2:04:19] egaszinaf: do it JP!
[2:04:21] Zyntho: You should lol
[2:04:22] GileonFletcher: do it for the kid D:
[2:04:24] tjmiller1988: isn't the lore behind it like real deep?

[2:04:29] ワフルデラ: but aren't you a gamer D:
[2:04:29] Zyntho: bonding
[2:04:40] egaszinaf: having fun with family watching young adults stuff :D
[2:04:41] countmarcula: its only PG-13
[2:04:44] thesestrangenotions: It changed a lot
[2:04:46] der_dritte: I am sure it will be fun?
[2:04:58] Zyntho: backstory is whatever matpat can pull out of his ass from what im understanding
[2:05:05] Daemerius: stripHmm "deep"
[2:05:07] Sweevle: The videos of people hugging the animatronics (and actors in suits) at the cinema's creep me out
[2:05:08] Reductive_Reasoning: convoluted is not always deep
[2:05:09] Larrith: Blizzcon is next week.

[2:05:37] der_dritte: I watched the first of the IT reboot movies at a cinema, starting half past 9 at night, in a city I didn't know. Pretty sure that was a cardiac event for me.
[2:05:38] ワフルデラ: it's the thing of the game, but I think lore wise it's more psychological horror
[2:05:45] Archangel3003: We've just got Christmas Five Night at Freddies toys in and the one of them is like a creepy snowman and Freddie has a Santa outfit etc
[2:05:47] jmm548: noth9ing
