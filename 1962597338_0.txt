[1:23:29] BlueSapphyre: Yeah. It’s 3p dungeon of the endless.
[1:23:46] ploki122: @AinzN Yeah, it was more tower defense, and less arcade-y
[1:24:13] WadeDMcGinnis: Cohh is just sending out good vibes
[1:24:15] AinzN: Yeah I think I bought Dungeon of the Endless and didn't know what kind of game it was and stopped playing it as I was bad at it ijpKEK
[1:24:15] ワフルデラ: the biggest gripe I have with the game is that the red laser is near invisible

[1:27:00] epicshoo: D$ indeed stripFufu
[1:27:10] woschdvendetta: @mrgein_182 same, but it's starfield not finished, bought Alan wake 2, only playing Warframe ijpSUFFER
[1:27:14] AinzN: @epicshoo peepoGiggles
[1:27:22] SyedHaroonAli: @MrGein_182 a third run is better than D4 NODDERS sir
[1:27:36] SyedHaroonAli: @epicshoo LUL
[1:27:47] MrGein_182: lets all be honest of all those games Starfield is the worst by far
[1:28:15] AinzN: Got to say I like the cartoon word effects of this game so far

[1:33:39] ワフルデラ: the colours are indicative of their weakness, blue = electric, red = fire
[1:34:15] ワフルデラ: red room just means DANGER
[1:34:33] ploki122: bottom is lit up with Dust
[1:34:49] Lcnt: red rooms have enemy spawns, and the other 2 are unlit so it's the broken bulb, they'd be red if lit

[1:35:34] ワフルデラ: @ワフルデラ dark rooms sometimes have modifiers on lower floors, like enemies regen while in dark rooms
[1:35:47] ワフルデラ: but you can pay dust to disable the mods
[1:36:16] ploki122: is there a setting, like for OSRS, to hide roofs when they're in the way? KEKW
[1:36:33] ワフルデラ: I wish Sadge
[1:37:19] ploki122: that game had issues... and still has issues; but it did a lot of stuff right
[1:37:30] ワフルデラ: chests shouldn't be class specific, chests can drop random weapons, handguns or heavy weapons regardless of who opens it
[1:38:12] ワフルデラ: no, the only ones who get XP are the turrets
[1:38:17] ワフルデラ: depending on damage they do

[1:45:26] epicshoo: @Provision_ gotcha. firefox being weird. worked for me in chrome
[1:45:39] ploki122: yes, all the icons flashing on the map needs to be interacted with
[1:46:50] Felgrun: Wit helps with turrent healing and defense
[1:46:52] ワフルデラ: wit has something to do with how good the turrets are and how fast you can repair them as long as you are in the same room
[1:47:05] Sonatta: i just logged into FF14 and it asked me if i wanted to join the novice network... i've been playing for year, wtf, LUL
[1:47:17] BerryTrunk: @itmeJP remember to pick up what you buy from the merchant, as it just initally drops it on the ground.
[1:47:35] Joemonk3y: you can ping the map, i forget the button but i remapped to MMB
[1:47:37] AinzN: @Sonatta need to get good!

[1:47:44] Joemonk3y: but it only pings where YOU are, you can't point at something and ping it
[1:47:50] mustard_one: You can ping you location but not the map unfortunately
[1:47:53] Sonatta: @AinzN pssssh!
[1:47:58] ワフルデラ: top right has a white door to open
[1:48:10] Lcnt: iirc V or B to ping

[1:49:59] BroqRox: monkaSHAKE the screen shake
[1:50:02] DobbsjustDobbs: I assume setting u p turrets in the pathway before starting it is the plan
[1:50:10] woschdvendetta: Or the good old round trip time
[1:51:26] ワフルデラ: @DobbsjustDobbs it's actually finding a balance between finding the least amount of turrets to build and it being effective as the amount of turrets you build can be pretty restrictive sometimes
[1:51:44] epicshoo: sonicRun
[1:52:00] AinzN: I'm getting kind of Risk of Rain vibes from this game and I like that

[1:56:14] AinzN: @ghostsofcarcosa ijpH ijpHUG
[1:56:36] DevilsShad0w: is this game playable solo?
[1:56:42] ワフルデラ: @ワフルデラ basicly it's about "What can I do with around 10 turrets in this section"
[1:57:09] ワフルデラ: @DevilsShad0w it's playable solo, you get 1 AI companion, you can unlock a second AI companion and it has great aim and you can tell it to stay to defend or follow you
[1:57:41] Muffnar: its me muffdood
[1:57:47] DevilsShad0w: there was that yellow diamond icon at the corner of the bar @itmeJP
[1:58:03] epicshoo: only host progression? Smadge
[1:58:14] DevilsShad0w: ah nvm, thought that was the quest
[1:58:22] ワフルデラ: they are going to patch co-op progression soon(TM)
[1:58:36] mustard_one: Guests can upgrade characters they have unlocked. Weapons are done by the host
[1:58:52] epicshoo: was that just an afterthought? seems bad to do it after launch
[1:59:08] ワフルデラ: quests are auto picked up
[1:59:10] Dandylion_: That first quest you'll have to do in your lobby
[1:59:15] mustard_one: Quest is on the left side in the archives

[2:00:50] sckeperz: top left there was
[2:01:12] ploki122: those were the quests

[2:04:13] AinzN: Chat how is this game to play solo?
[2:04:39] ワフルデラ: @AinzN amazing, you get 1 AI companion, can unlock a second, they have great aim and you can tell them to follow or defend a certain area

[2:07:48] WDForty: you upgrade them when they get enough exp
[2:07:51] mustard_one: When the base gets a golden square they can be upgraded
[2:07:54] Felgrun: You gotta hit it to upgrade
[2:08:01] ワフルデラ: turret EXP is damage based, not kill based
[2:08:03] WDForty: they'll glow when you can upgrade the turret
