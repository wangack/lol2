[0:48:11] RevCom: LUL
[0:48:12] Archangel3003: @thesestrangenotions If the only reason it's in there is because of Phil then that's complete bs and still taking away from a game more deserving honestly. But I guess Geoff wants to keep Phil friends.
[0:49:05] UnboundSouls: i still only know half the story of FF16 because i was watching Jp's playthrough and lost the will to continue after the 43th sidequest courtillyDead
[0:49:35] ThePezinator30125: PartyPls

[1:29:35] Weirwood: I love this game
[1:29:37] stanmarsch: is this the 20 min movie thing?
[1:29:44] Weirwood: @xavus_tv yeah
[1:29:46] fadorri: @Xavus_TV yes
[1:29:49] Xavus_TV: that's rad
[1:29:59] AttoJoule: @Xavus_TV same both for both
[1:30:06] ワフルデラ: the film is at the end of this section
[1:30:08] FightForTheLost: Yeah
[1:30:12] Jenny_MB: So Zane is Alan Wake's physical actor and that was his real voice.
[1:30:36] Xavus_TV: @Jenny_MB Yeah thats what i meant, but worded poorly lol
[1:30:45] The_Worsti: MMMM spoopyness continues
[1:31:11] Lihapiiras: Zane is voiced by Ilkka Villi (the physcial actor of Alan) and Alan/Scratch is voided by Mathew Poretta.
[1:31:29] m3rcer: deep
[1:31:42] Jenny_MB: Haha it's quite difficult to explain it in text tbh - it's such a unique collaboration between Alan Wake's physical actor and his VA. I love it.
[1:31:59] sneakypooo: That's what I heard at least
[1:31:59] The_Worsti: Matthew Poretta is also Dr Darling in Control
[1:32:10] fadorri: w a k e
[1:32:16] Xavus_TV: @The_Worsti so that's matthew poretta?! neat!
[1:32:20] TwoRedWine: wake!
[1:32:36] Xavus_TV: Man im so excited to replay Control now that i got a 3080
[1:32:44] Faintlich: Casey's VA definitely also did Trench in Control right? Sounds so similar
[1:32:57] Jenny_MB: Dr Darling singing Dynamite in Control was so good too.
[1:33:16] Jenny_MB: Yep @Faintlich it's the same VA.
[1:33:20] Xavus_TV: @Faintlich Yeah, and he was also alex casey's aka max paynes original VA
[1:33:22] countmarcula: alan way-kuh
[1:33:26] Faintlich: Makes sense
[1:33:40] Faintlich: The Trench performance in Control is 100/10
[1:34:00] Jenny_MB: i love his performance in Max Payne 3 as well.
[1:34:31] Jenny_MB: I like how Remedy always reuses the same cast in their games.
[1:35:10] ワフルデラ: I think so yeah
[1:35:15] Creed_of_the_dragon: yes
[1:35:31] Jenny_MB: Yeah, you're on the home stretch with Alan.
[1:35:41] ワフルデラ: btw @itmeJP the Old God of Asgard songs are on their youtube channel

[1:36:05] flameod2: Holy shit jp i am catching up on the start of the stream i missed and you did AMAZING on the summoning with Saga. Maybe the best ive seen. You played EXACTLY like i think they would have wanted mwah
[1:36:58] tissotti: I loved the chapter songs. Especially the early ones. Would love those to be in Spotify
[1:36:58] ワフルデラ: @Jenny_MB not yet
[1:37:21] itmeBOT: Join our public Discord! discord.gg/itmejp
[1:37:24] ワフルデラ: I think this game has a lot of stuff that you can't complete in the first run by design
[1:37:40] ワフルデラ: cause of the "new story elements" for NG+
[1:38:08] simaryex: @tissotti chapter songs are on Spotify but not the old gods of asgard songs
[1:38:10] sneakypooo: @ワフルデラThey're on Spotify for me. Seven songs.
[1:38:36] Jenny_MB: I'm really looking forward to NG+ and the DLC.
[1:38:40] ワフルデラ: @sneakypooo there are only 3 Old Gods of Asgard songs for Alan Wake 2
[1:38:54] tissotti: @simaryex Oh great!
[1:39:15] sneakypooo: @ワフルデラAh ok, I guess I read the chat a bit too hastily. I'm tired :D
[1:40:00] ワフルデラ: Hmm
[1:40:34] Weirwood: Poets of the Fall is releasing an album soon I heard
