[1:07:37] Archangel3003: Ok I'm back. Have to leave the channel open long enough for it to start ticking on the countdown and then open the other channel it seems now
[1:07:57] Gat0rCh0mp: yeah he can support
[1:07:58] Ebra: yes
[1:08:01] BuggleStrus: support/mid mage
[1:08:10] Gat0rCh0mp: its like having a lux supp
[1:08:15] RlDennis: Doesn't feel like a good support to me. Mana costs are too damn high Madge
[1:08:22] amagikarpp: Ive seen pros play him as a bot carry too
[1:08:25] Baludor: Tbf, who doesn't get played as support these days.
[1:08:35] Gat0rCh0mp: he has 9 abilities so
[1:08:35] Ebra: too many
[1:08:46] amagikarpp: there are 10 so neither do they
[1:08:46] lost2knight: Dude's got like 10 abilities he can do almost any role but is better at mid
[1:08:55] Baludor: He's like Invoker Dota, I think?
[1:09:30] Gat0rCh0mp: dont gotta learn his 10 abilities if he dead
[1:09:31] Archangel3003: I hope I get these Twitch drops as it took weeks back and forth support to get first lot and then after saying they would deactivate my second account, the second drops went there as they didn't deactivate it so I had to manually delete.
[1:10:20] AinzN: @Archangel3003 I only have one Snap account and it is linked to my Twitch and even though I claimed them I never got them in game

[1:10:54] BaosilisK: suraciJam
[1:11:12] gametourism: He gets dived on pretty easily though
[1:11:26] ワフルデラ: Covid is getting ready to pump it up
[1:11:34] gametourism: He has a root
[1:11:36] Ebra: fear
[1:11:37] LiteralZero: How you feeling? I had a gnarly fever last night but i feel much better today - just full of cold now
[1:11:39] ワフルデラ: Jinx E
[1:11:42] Woofric: He has a straight shot, a long range circle, a line slow and damage, an auto attack buff, a line spees buff, a shield giving aoe, a straight shot fear, a circle that roots if you're in it and not blocked by something, an pull from the sides to the center, and a straight shot that attaches, grows a circle that slow, before exploding.
[1:11:43] thesestrangenotions: COVID hiding in the bushes waiting to gank ijpFLURK
[1:11:48] lost2knight: He ha sa root, a fear, and a slow

[1:12:06] Archangel3003: @AinzN Yeah I saw a lot of people say it was scuffed and they didn't get theirs. I gave up even trying support for the Shocker stuff after how long it took to get first lot lol.

[1:12:35] AinzN: @Archangel3003 I don't even play Snap anymore but I still wanted my free loot!
[1:12:47] Ebra: EZ
[1:13:25] Woofric: You can see what he's about to throw by the color of his brush. If it's purple, he's throwing out CC. Red he's throwing damage. Blue he's deploying a buff. Yellow is his ult.
[1:13:27] br4nd0nh347: emotional support
[1:14:28] Archangel3003: @AinzN I find it depends on the season how much I play. Either I just farm missions for season pass or I do that and keep playing based on how I'm enjoying it.
[1:14:57] Woofric: If he hits you with an ability, you get a mark. If he hits another ability, it drops an aoe explosion at your feet.
[1:15:18] Archangel3003: So against this new champ you have to expect several different things that could hit you?
[1:15:24] thatguyuknow985: yep
[1:15:59] Woofric: He has a lot of tools, but they are all mostly telegraphed.
[1:16:44] SchnellBier: peepoJAMMER
[1:16:45] RlDennis: qw from hwei
[1:16:45] gametourism: His Q-W, its got a long range nuke
[1:16:47] Woofric: He's balanced by the fact that you can see what color he's pulling, and he can miss everything except his auto attack buff, which doesn't do a lot.
[1:16:49] crawds: invoker solar strike basically
[1:16:51] inuakurei: Hwei
[1:16:51] AinzN: @Archangel3003 I jsut got bored of it. My fav type of deck was like Destroy/Discard and it just wasn't very good till recently
