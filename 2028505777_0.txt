[2:29:08] BlazeRom: I don't see Fisk giving up his empire
[2:29:12] MercuryWelles: So that was just mtx for her leg?
[2:29:13] gorlork: @martijntjuh STOP KEKW
[2:29:17] icawn_: Didn't Maya ask Fisk about her fathers death in Hawkeye? SO maybe he wants to make it up for her/manipulate her
[2:29:20] justjoshinh: @martijntjuh i audibly sighed LUL
[2:29:28] BlazeRom: they sure have a lot of credits for every episode

[2:32:03] MysticfulX: that's a skrull Kappa
[2:32:28] spideycsa: after credit scene in the last episode
[2:32:30] BlazeRom: let's go next Pausing
[2:32:35] Ravnim: it has my attention better than secret invasion
[2:32:54] Allomance: episode 4 PauseChamp
[2:33:02] LordSpudlington: much better than secret invasion
[2:33:11] justjoshinh: yea its there street level stuff
[2:33:14] spideycsa: Marvel Spotlight all gonna be street level things I think
[2:33:23] spoookins: What happens to her then?
[2:33:35] Weirwood: I'm enjoying this show. I had to basically force myself to keep watching Secret Invasion
[2:33:39] ItsNoxid: @spideycsa that werewolf show was a spotlight
[2:33:48] GunzGames: This was totally ment to be a movie and they chopped it up into a TV series for some reason.
[2:33:50] icawn_: Fisk needs to explain her fathers death, right?
[2:33:50] BlazeRom: we could watch the next 2 episodes Kappa
[2:33:55] BlazeRom: since they are short and all
[2:34:09] Allomance: 1 hours left Jesse has time
[2:34:09] ItsNoxid: i think maya joins him
[2:34:15] gorlork: It's an apertif
[2:34:18] Weirwood: It's an arc
[2:34:20] m3rcer: i mean we could just watch the episodes instead of guessing KEKW
[2:34:21] justjoshinh: @GunzGames i didnt get that feeling with this, tbh theres alot that seemed necessary for it to be chopped up
[2:34:37] Weirwood: Jesse has to leave doesn't he?
[2:34:41] spideycsa: her origin story
[2:34:43] MercuryWelles: The yellowstone spinoff tactic
[2:34:45] Shoaron: @m3rcer dont think they gonna watch anymore today, Jesse gotta iirc
[2:35:03] m3rcer: @m3rcer yeah he has until top of the hour roughly i think
[2:35:22] flipflapflopflipperflaps: hmmMeeting
[2:35:40] spideycsa: its a good series to make oyu want to watch the whole thing
[2:35:55] StenSaxWTF: Luke cage did that and it was kinda lame
[2:36:30] ワフルデラ: her plan is that she's gonna slayyy
[2:36:42] spideycsa: SHe was shot in the begining
[2:36:59] Weirwood: I think it's both
[2:37:07] justjoshinh: both yea
[2:37:17] br4nd0nh347: EXPLAINING EXPLAINING EXPLAINING
[2:37:55] BlazeRom: maybe the next 2 episodes shows her motivation Kappa ?
[2:38:32] justjoshinh: i think there parallels between fighting to proctect with love and fighting to protect with hate, i feel its that type of story
[2:38:48] justjoshinh: hence garndma and maya differences
[2:38:52] ItsNoxid: her grandfather giving her the leg saying shes a new york girl
[2:38:54] Weirwood: From Hells Kitchen to Oklahoma
[2:38:58] iilu: Next episode she gets shot in the eye and Fisk quips "An eye for an eye" and we're back on track for an MCU show
[2:39:02] ワフルデラ: Daredevil shows up because Maya needs a lawyer
[2:39:11] Weirwood: @iilu boo

[3:06:03] RlDennis: I think it's on switch, playstation and my phone lol
[3:06:05] ReginaldXIV: Sony bs
[3:06:09] KingRahe: im still surprised sony hasnt combined the funimation and crunchyroll apps yet

[3:08:11] Sonatta: that's only what... 200 hours to get there? LUL
[3:08:11] jameskrut: Only gets good after 500 episodes.  So you're telling me I have to watch something 7 days straight before it gets good.  This is why no one is willing to give One Piece a chance
[3:08:14] BlueSapphyre: @Imbadyoureworse what. no. it's one of the best arcs.
[3:08:15] xTiLkx: thats some crazy world building investment tho lol
[3:08:18] MrRavez: i recommend the LGTV companion app. Makes it more monitor like for PC usage.

[3:08:49] ghostsofcarcosa: ijpSAD
[3:08:54] BlueSapphyre: @Imbadyoureworse ohhh. also no. because ennies lobby is the best arc.
[3:08:54] BlazeRom: oof
[3:08:55] RlDennis: @Imbadyoureworse It has alot of build up from arcs like water 7/enies lobby and even the 4 or so arcs right before it
[3:09:13] Ravnim: raimi said there's even more layoff coming

[3:10:00] jjjoriss: they should have at least first fixed the way their streams stream
[3:10:05] Sonatta: these lay offs right on the heels of the Unity layoffs
[3:10:11] Senna_Minxy: AI Voice acting comin in hot apparently
[3:10:17] extrabacon: Amazon only make record profit but not as much as they want so they gotta lay off a bunch of people
[3:10:32] T_W_O: Nvidia providing Twitch with next level AI to replace folks

[3:12:04] SMonTwitch: Yeah, hopefully all those impacted can find somewhere else quickly
[3:12:28] BlueSapphyre: @extrabacon amazon churns through talent. i think the average tenure is less than 2 years.
[3:12:36] ワフルデラ: man I wish we were overstaffed
[3:12:52] T_W_O: Is Twitch still showing growth?
[3:13:02] xTiLkx: I dont have friends at all

[3:17:06] Xenbusa: They will probably buff Hercules once he's not in the spotlight cache anymore, as is tradition.

[3:44:19] doncoffee: See I like top and adc
[3:44:21] ワフルデラ: the voidgrubs at top can be very impactful if you get them all
[3:44:24] Drolheim: support is fun but hard to climb
[3:44:27] The_Faceless_Void: top support or jungle
[3:44:29] doncoffee: though adc only if i have a decent support
