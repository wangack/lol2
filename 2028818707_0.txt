[0:27:40] Rejnols: Not sure about Ekko, but i have seen ALOT of mages go Stormsurge into either Shadow Flame or Ludens.. Gun? Forgot the name
[0:27:48] Squabbers: True Damage Ekko is really the "What's blud wafflin' about?" skin.
[0:27:48] Afrasabi: @Percussion1 I mean yeah, it's better than them just being surrogate off tanks. It'll all shake out in a week or two, I'm sure.
[0:27:54] Oglino: Ludens partner or something
[0:28:30] Nak3rbott: stormsurge is a no brainer on Katarina so I am assuming other engagy mages do well with it too

[1:16:28] Oglino: its one crit per champion
[1:16:34] Oglino: its like heartsteel kinda
[1:16:47] jaxkmurphy: I suppose it‚Äôs the q crit kick ? that people do it for
[1:16:48] helloimvoids: sundered sky seems good cause it‚Äôs got a low cooldown like running eclipse
[1:16:58] Grognog: It gives temp health which is nice on a bruiser, alongside the normal stats being solid
[1:16:59] Oglino: and its every 6 seconds so its pretty low cd
[1:17:21] LilAboveAverage: can someone explain how the voidgrubs work?
[1:17:55] Oglino: LilAboveAverage you kill em and they give you a permanent buff that gives you a true damage burn to towers
[1:17:55] Moobot: I'm sorry, but Queen is currently unavailable to accept your call. Please leave a voicemail after the tone or hang up and dial again...*beep*
[1:18:10] helloimvoids: @lilaboveaverage taking them gives a buff for the rest of the game that behaves like a portable zzrot when you take tower‚Äôs
[1:18:14] Grognog: Wait they're permanent buffs?
[1:18:15] Grognog: Holy hell
[1:18:30] jaxkmurphy: can‚Äôt lose any
[1:18:32] jaxkmurphy: you need all
[1:18:33] LilAboveAverage: they are permanent?! crazy

[1:19:01] jaxkmurphy: ah ok sorry
[1:19:03] Jocostar: I wish i had an extra dudester
[1:19:06] Oglino: makes top livelier
[1:19:12] LilAboveAverage: I love this new patch
[1:19:16] LateStar0: the bonus is that you summon a gupp to help attack tower right?
[1:19:18] LilAboveAverage: love the map changes
[1:19:23] LateStar0: besides the dot
[1:19:24] FeatherRun: What was that giant pink cloud in that moshpit? Is it suppose to block vision on everything?
[1:19:26] helloimvoids: it definitely feels better than it sounds
[1:19:32] CompulsiveOne: is item cd still tied to ability haste?
[1:19:36] Oglino: LateStar0 yes at 5 stacks
[1:19:40] CompulsiveOne: if so sundered sky is pretty good
[1:19:54] Oglino: sundered sky is nutty for bruisers
[1:20:20] Bakkoda24: are they just playing 3v2 in bot lane?
[1:20:30] inariko_: new patch same old party in bot
[1:20:39] Jocostar: yay toplane

[1:41:40] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[1:41:45] Rejnols: Based on  the very limited data, AP champs are the clear winners. Doesn't seem like tank champs are even performing that well. Few AD champs are doing okay, mostly does that built lethality @lawlman
[1:41:57] TheodenArratay: would it be good on rengar?
[1:42:03] TheodenArratay: cus hes a combo champ
[1:42:03] Grognog: Heard that jungles setup for lethatlity are sitting real pretty at the moment

[2:27:03] Oglino: yeh
[2:27:38] Grognog: Yeah that seemed rough in team fights
[2:27:43] TheodenArratay: my thought is you could skip out on the crit items and go sundered and then build lethality, that is if youre just going to ulti combo people all game

[2:44:04] Don_Savik: Madge just because im a grubbler doesn't make me a wubbler

[2:44:23] Bravarra: that was almost cool
[2:44:23] DraygoDraygon: Tried though
[2:44:24] TheMadBadger: @futuresight23 Spawns Grubblies to attack towers, you deal extra true damage to towers with 6 Wubbly buff
[2:44:37] Mher1101: how is fiora getting destroyed by a varus
[2:44:45] Wpios_dervelv: Hello ppl
[2:44:46] CryoCryptic: they're just trying to even out the game don't worry

[2:45:08] Oglino: peepoDJ
[2:45:13] Stickiler: @TheMadBadger You deal extra true damage to towers regardless, 6 wubbly buff gives an extra extra wubbly on top of 5 wubbly to kill towers
[2:45:28] Wpios_dervelv: Have u tried hullbreaker?
[2:45:36] NoSweetOnlySalty: lookUp thats a lot of wubblies
[2:45:37] SalemPulsifer: @Stickiler I think they give you grubblies, and no wubblies
[2:45:54] PoorMansPoison: @TheMadBadger No the 6 wubblie buff gives extra grubblies on top of the 5 wubblie grubblies
[2:45:57] arrowdeath4: wait, hullbreaker no longer requires you to be alone?
[2:45:57] Stickiler: @SalemPulsifer You're right, so at 5 wubbly buff you get 1 grubbly, and 6 wubbly buff gives 2 grubblies
[2:46:06] Broke99: Grubbly
[2:46:11] BuckerT88: They made it not make you tanky now, but adds a 5th atk dmg on structures.

[3:40:10] GebisGaming: @Thorr74 the void grubs don't feel as strong as dragon. they feel overhyped
[3:40:12] TheMadBadger: @Thorr74 It's something i could see happening in the future for sure, once the pros or koreans figure something out
[3:40:13] CinderChef: meow
[3:40:33] just_a_bad_spawn: grubs are whatever I think
[3:40:51] GebisGaming: but I can totally see bot swapping with top in order to be safer form ganks
