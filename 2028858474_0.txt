[6:23:06] Nightbot: Satellite by Harry Styles
[6:23:11] baghoulio: @ZyrusVallien your autos gain on hit damage and alternate between giving you defense and shredding enemy defense -- i have no clue how long it lasts lol

[6:23:52] sack02: shen is so fucked
[6:23:57] Noftie: @ZyrusVallien yes, the buff is for 5s and it alternates every auto. It gives armor/MR and phys/magic pen for light and dark respectively
[6:24:16] ZyrusVallien: Does the buff go away when you change auto
[6:24:30] KittyCatRightMeow: IRELIAING
[6:24:31] ZyrusVallien: Or do you have both at the same time
[6:24:36] ZyrusVallien: It seems so weird
