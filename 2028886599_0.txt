[1:13:41] Multipogopuschel: did they buff jhin or is he especially good with the new items? I feel like he's quite good atm
[1:13:43] barely_ironic: I think Ivern might be getting a bit tilted

[1:13:46] yan_taro: rilays?
[1:13:57] lich1121: @pinkforjustice nah, you can't apply it that easily, and if you hit with E doesn't really matter cause thay are already slowed
[1:13:59] poonatico: maybe malignance dmg will scale!!
[1:14:00] pinkforjustice: Why not liandries?
[1:14:03] RaposaNevada: Lyandr into shadowflame to crit burn?

[1:14:42] Multipogopuschel: @Multipogopuschel I guess he got buffed then or everybody is just cracked now
[1:14:42] ZarkonWiz: and the mana is not that great on swain
[1:14:50] hiimawarii00: idk if the ivern is having fun guys

[1:15:11] Megamixr: Ngl kogma seems like dog
[1:15:15] Poweradi: @ZarkonWiz completely depends on teamcomp of your team and enemy team, and having malignance is basically double your ult dps and rylais on top...all the AP you need if you wanna build tanky
[1:16:02] ZarkonWiz: i mean, if your team has a lot of cc and slows
[1:16:02] pyroflexin: @Megamixr he can be great if he has a team to play off of
[1:16:05] n7stwitch: isnt shadowflame better on ap kog ?

[1:16:14] new0lympian: shadow flame

[1:19:04] dJustOne: @pekinwoof what do you use to check items for your builds for your videos? Always wondered
[1:19:07] dinastyxy: liandrys sucks
[1:19:08] Megamixr: This is a tank and adc season
[1:19:10] dJustOne: Which websites*
[1:19:11] phosfe_: Archengel into crit item
[1:19:12] ZarkonWiz: build lost chapter first and then build liandrys
[1:19:13] dinastyxy: most of the dmg is from ramp

[1:19:30] n7stwitch: its half, no?
[1:19:36] dJustOne: @poweradi ty!
[1:19:41] Megamixr: @synettive_ true

[1:19:47] sleepingforestmusic: removed health from it, isn't that it
[1:19:48] twitchuser6782: I Am A Worthless Idiot Who Deserves A Perma Ban @PekinWoof
[1:19:59] NadiaBusiness: It doesnt deal bonus max % hp damage ontop of the burn anymore

[1:20:12] Dragonetta_: damn they fucked liandry's
[1:20:25] Kinkou_Order: it doesnt get an AP ratio now though :(
[1:20:28] NozuruKuyutsuki: old iandries had aap scaling and base damage
[1:20:29] dinastyxy: the ap scaling dmg
[1:20:30] Megamixr: I think it was supposed to be anti tank item for mages
[1:20:30] biggrag: other passiv is gone

[1:20:37] ZarkonWiz: what about building lost chapter and going for other items?
[1:20:38] Megamixr: Now it's just generic damage
[1:20:39] Knayten: singed is really happy
[1:20:39] Gabiel19: no ability haste
[1:20:44] 19yruj: no haste either
[1:20:53] tmax221: i think its probably just more for all champs across instead of anti tank?
[1:20:53] NadiaBusiness: PEKIN it had bonus damage based on the target's hp PLUS the burn damage @PekinWoof
[1:20:55] Ichinichi: there's no base damage for squishier targets, but i dunno what the breakpoint is
[1:21:03] Kinkou_Order: i think its better now, but it was cooler before
[1:21:12] Dragonetta_: Pekin trying his hardest to hold onto liandry's Copege
[1:21:13] Megamixr: So they removed the anti-tank part and added in some cringe
[1:21:15] Gabiel19: 3000k for no ability hast hurts me
[1:21:32] Knayten: they changed it back to how it was before
[1:21:33] Ichinichi: i HATE that there is no ability haste
[1:21:34] NadiaBusiness: @Gabiel19 300,000 sounds like alot of g PEKW
[1:21:45] PairusDragonoidEcuador: All megic items need more AP and %scaling on pasives
[1:21:51] 19yruj: theres so little haste now its sad
[1:21:59] Poweradi: @Gabiel19 300,000g is NOTHING for Season 13 Challenger player Pekin of woof

[1:23:47] HexUlixes: fimbulwinter sleeper
[1:23:52] pinkforjustice: Try it next game
[1:23:53] Gabiel19: less damage on both passives, no ability haste, no mana
[1:23:54] cclutchness: Liandrys are usually buiilt vs tanks, so calculate on ~3000 hp
[1:23:56] PairusDragonoidEcuador: Mages need an item that give you minimum 40 haste...
[1:23:56] NozuruKuyutsuki: is ludens no good on kog
[1:23:59] 19yruj: have you thought about a hwei build at all or no?
[1:24:00] TheLoFiAxolotl: @JackV1 i feel you... if i forgot a 0 i'd want to too
[1:24:01] pinkforjustice: Archangels -> Liandries

[1:24:50] lorekage: stormsurge feels so busted
[1:24:53] 19yruj: @Garneq I agre there was too much before but I feel like they overdid it with removing most of it
[1:24:58] curb_ur_enthusiasm_pekin: granted there are only 400 games on kog mid, hes in the bottom two for high elo midlaners
[1:25:00] havokthetoast: AWOO
[1:25:27] Lichtbringer: I am thinking about Malignence on Anivia, I feel if she can't use it nobody can.  But in my first games it didn't feel that good.
[1:25:39] Khaansu: didnt they buff ap from seraphs too?
[1:25:42] Khaansu: mana*
[1:25:50] 19yruj: @Lichtbringer should be strong on anivia, swain, liss and malz
[1:25:53] Garneq: @19yruj I feel like game is again SLIGHTLY more skill based by removing free haste and mythics
[1:25:56] kuperco: damn anti heal costs so little now thats nice
[1:26:10] Knayten: giga pen
[1:26:10] Khaansu: @Lichtbringer pretty good on annie too
[1:26:18] elliseden: @kuperco i think its bc its intended for ap supports to build now
[1:26:22] TheLoFiAxolotl: hot take.... haste should never have been a stat because it makes balancing way too hard
[1:26:33] floaties10: If they have the new Mr tank item you'll deal 0 Sadge
[1:26:41] PairusDragonoidEcuador: In the end, Shadowflame is so huge and a good build
[1:26:48] 19yruj: @Garneq true, I feel like some chaps will need cd buffs in order to keep them viable though, we'll just have to see how it turns out
[1:27:15] kuperco: @kuperco thats even better then
[1:27:18] floaties10: Storm on cd
[1:27:19] chucklel: @pekinwoof have you started placements yet?

[1:28:07] TerrellDean: Why is it not good?
[1:28:07] floaties10: If all balls hit 1 guy it's strong
[1:28:13] august_winds: @cheeseymoon1973 should proc off her R auto but probably bait
[1:28:14] kuperco: ludens new tech??????

[1:28:18] propelius: The illusion of free choice
[1:28:19] quattron69: Is it not season 14 ?
[1:28:27] lorekage: what about lich

[1:28:50] chucklel: it would be a balancing NIGHTMARE
[1:28:51] zaphax: new player experience would be even worse and balancing would be awful
[1:28:51] kick_man2: half the itmes would be ignored
