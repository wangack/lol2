[3:08:10] 6x5x1x18: With all that aimed at you might need Zhonyas
[3:08:13] PsyOniPanda: I still dont understand why would  they do baron pit look like that, it looks like a pe**** shape
[3:08:47] navcite: lol
[3:08:53] Majmur: Keep in mind it can have different shapes also Kappa
[3:08:53] Dansy8611: @Majmur yu hav to get out of the mythics mindset, buy wat will keep you competitive and help you keep farmin and trading without running out or health or mana. Like liandrys first on a mana hungry champ is no good so buy something like enmity of masses first with cooldown and mana.
[3:09:15] lyndoneuf: becasue its a change

[3:09:32] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: god save me
[3:09:38] Konstantino_: @PsyOniPanda  the pit has 3 shapes now,based on the baron type it spawned,check patch notes
[3:09:52] PsyOniPanda: looks like a kid draw of 2d pe**** to me
[3:09:58] fvckcruz: @Dansy8611 tl dr
[3:10:45] Smittyy916: Instead of giving you voice coms like you've been asking for here, we decided to change baron pit. You're welcome.
[3:10:53] brucewayne955: that enemy mid is furicious
[3:10:55] sozinszn: What skin is that
[3:11:19] InsaneDive: voice coms sounds so fucking sweaty
[3:11:29] ScarletRainMk1: what the fuck does baron pit changing have to do with voice comms anyway...
[3:11:38] keshaluvr69: yeah because it is a moving pink ward with a radius
[3:11:42] ScarletRainMk1: void scuttle does something new

[3:12:01] navcite: after baron comes up i tink
[3:12:01] Smittyy916: Ok but u can have a mute button. Match making is dogshit. But seems like adding an option for voice is easier than fixing matchmaking, imo.
