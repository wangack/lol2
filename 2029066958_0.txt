[0:48:36] OrbitalPeacock: And you can't even stack it on minions
[0:50:05] tobyteemo: terminus is bait item for the teemo
[0:50:36] LtChezo: yea its better to just stick to rageblade
[0:51:07] LtChezo: maybe its good when the enemy is tank heavy
[0:51:13] henrymichell2: ipavKEK 󠀀
[0:53:22] Arklegru: Manco says terminus requires Lethal Tempo

[1:00:44] siderick96: @ipav999 check item numbers
[1:01:07] siderick96: aah mb
[1:01:36] teemolingus: what about you put the champ stat instead the runes?
[1:02:24] siderick96: maybe "total stats gained" or "damage by penetration" would be useful
[1:03:06] LtChezo: garen?
[1:03:23] hamzajamal25: ratJAM
[1:03:54] ParkingSeal: lol
[1:04:00] Goddy: Nerf Teemo

[1:04:55] citrixgateway: Is there a new map? Mid looks way bigger now!
[1:05:27] tobyteemo: ggs
[1:05:52] tobyteemo: what do u think of the map? im not a big fan of how wide the river is
[1:05:54] tobyteemo: at topside
[1:06:00] tobyteemo: easy for enemy jg to gank
[1:06:07] LtChezo: its probably gonna be hard to tell dmg until the release item dmg no. for new tiems
[1:06:10] LtChezo: *items
[1:06:40] tobyteemo: damn i get ganked all trhe time
[1:06:44] tobyteemo: like super super mega camped
[1:07:33] tobyteemo: ipavNoted
[1:10:06] teemolingus: @ipav999 the best is kraken
[1:11:14] Aldurfus: NOTED

[1:14:14] Aldurfus: @hamzajamal25 MYAAA
[1:20:27] SMOrcane: people arent going to be sitting in the dot the entire time though
[1:20:28] samwlse: the penetration
[1:20:38] samwlse: its like black cleaver for magic damage
[1:20:44] ParkingSeal: wasn't that 7 attacks
[1:20:47] LtChezo: they arent ever gonna sit on malignance the whole time anyway
[1:20:48] teemolingus: @ipav999 its because the target dont move
[1:21:14] samwlse: if you wait to auto after the shred happens
[1:21:15] ParkingSeal: ah yeah - 6 and your Q
[1:21:17] samwlse: you will do more
[1:21:31] ParkingSeal: (was the reason)
[1:21:49] LtChezo: are you considering cosmic?
[1:22:11] LtChezo: its got hp back on it and movespeed after the first dmg
[1:23:03] Leetmmoman: stormsurge
[1:23:40] kleentz: Shieldbow still a thing?
[1:24:25] DeadlyBoy1234: when i went to work i saw ipav in practice tool, i am back from work still watching ipav on notepad. did he get into any game and comment on map changes?
[1:25:09] teemolingus: @ipav999 terminus?
[1:25:13] LtChezo: @DeadlyBoy1234 yea said the map changes make teemo more useful and that he has been ganked lass
[1:25:29] samwlse: since teemo has lots of base damage. shouldnt penetration and % damage increse be very strong on teemo?
[1:25:30] idckdolphins: do you like the new map?
[1:25:55] kleentz: He forgot terminus
[1:25:57] DeadlyBoy1234: @LtChezo ty my og bro. i was hoping teemo players will love these changes.
[1:26:35] samwlse: considering you get resistance
[1:26:38] samwlse: its decent
[1:27:22] LtChezo: as mush as i like the concept of terminus if you want ramping resistances for fighting just get a jak'shos
[1:27:35] Sarnyroth: @LtChezo why not both
[1:27:38] Sarnyroth: kek
[1:28:35] TnTizz: that is static shiv replacement?
[1:29:17] Sarnyroth: rip Silvermere Dawn

[1:33:05] LtChezo: i just wish there was a dual pen item the was just dmg
[1:33:17] samwlse: how much HP and resitance on dummy?
[1:33:37] LtChezo: 200 armor and mr
[1:34:35] Nemo_SWE: how are you going to win lane if you build tank items and lack damage?
[1:36:05] Taunt_7: and a ap version also doesnt do enough danage?
[1:36:21] Banmoo77: taitanic?
[1:36:36] Nemo_SWE: It the build you have now the most optimal in S14?
[1:37:01] Banmoo77: damage and tanky
[1:40:59] LtChezo: cosmic drive
[1:41:01] samwlse: riftmaker increses all damage right? not just AP damage
[1:42:03] Taunt_7: and shieldbow? is it bad?
[1:42:06] samwlse: is hullbreaker damge bad?
[1:42:13] LtChezo: ad mejais

[1:44:50] Taunt_7: does shieldbow provides a significant tankyness?
[1:44:58] Skimmi: what are we looking for?
[1:45:01] LtChezo: @chittos no
[1:45:06] tobyteemo: manco says adonhit will be the best build
[1:45:11] tobyteemo: he released a guide on youtube talking about it
[1:45:19] tobyteemo: idk if he's right tho
[1:45:58] Skimmi: New Shadowflame and Stormsurge sound interesting to me
[1:46:04] Cosmikator: ipav u need to upload a reaction video on mancos statement ipavNerd
[1:46:33] uselessfishlol: have you looked at the experimental hexplate already on teemo?
[1:46:36] Taunt_7: @chittos  Sadge
[1:47:02] uselessfishlol: ah
[1:47:10] Aldurfus: yeah 30 sec cd ruins it for taimo Smoge
[1:47:21] uselessfishlol: dang, I thought it would be good
[1:47:30] uselessfishlol: shadowflame is a good item though
[1:47:43] Cosmikator: naahhhh teemo is broken
[1:47:45] samwlse: just get all void grub and win on 3 item
[1:47:54] Skimmi: shadowflame stormsurge?
[1:47:56] ParkingSeal: @uselessfishlol he's been introducing us all to the experimental headache already on Teemo this season
[1:48:04] Cosmikator: just find "the build" NODDERS
[1:48:09] ParkingSeal: ( Kappa )
[1:48:30] LtChezo: lifesteal items havent changed
[1:48:43] samwlse: they changed how omnivamp works now
[1:48:51] Princess_Brahammer: Shrooms don't exist anyway when every game the enemy is building 4 sweepers. Feels Bad, but it is what it is. Ditch the liandris.
[1:48:54] samwlse: so no penalty for AOE or dot
[1:49:00] tobyteemo: throwback to chinese taimo hurricane bloodthirster
[1:49:04] Skimmi: Riftmaker is so dead
[1:49:46] teemolingus: @ipav999 what about drop the teemo and become the best garen world? Kappa
[1:50:22] ParkingSeal: MVGame #
[1:51:53] tobyteemo: warmog will work next patch when they add more hp runeds
[1:52:08] tobyteemo: u can have like 2 hp shards
[1:52:14] LtChezo: cosmic drive has 250 hp
[1:52:15] tobyteemo: yes
[1:52:20] tobyteemo: spideraxe on twitter posted it
[1:52:20] Skimmi: yeah instead of resistance runes
[1:52:29] tobyteemo: im in game rn i cant link
[1:52:37] tobyteemo: but spideraxe twitter
[1:53:02] LtChezo: https://twitter.com/Spideraxe30/status/1744836666706063523
[1:53:34] tobyteemo: taimo can be solved yay
[1:53:52] tobyteemo: health growth shard still there so u can have health growth
[1:53:53] tobyteemo: or health flat
[1:53:55] Skimmi: can't put resistances in rune shards anymore yeah
[1:53:56] tobyteemo: so u can have 2 health growth
[1:54:09] tobyteemo: 3rd row will have 1 hp flat or 1 hp growth
[1:54:12] tobyteemo: and 2nd row will have hp growth
[1:54:22] tobyteemo: so u can have double hp growth + overgrowth = wearmog
[1:54:42] Skimmi: 290 is a lot from overgrowth
[1:54:47] tobyteemo: true
[1:54:59] LtChezo: i would still like to offer cosmic drive for the hp
[1:55:11] Skimmi: isn't the scaling HP shard still there in the 3rd slot?
[1:55:19] LtChezo: hourglass
[1:55:23] Skimmi: think you can choose between 60 flat or the scaling one
[1:55:26] tobyteemo: jaksho could be the solve yeah
[1:55:33] tobyteemo: its like a worse kekoyle :( but has hp
[1:55:55] tobyteemo: or hullbreaker?
[1:55:58] tobyteemo: hullbreaker has dmg now
[1:56:02] kleentz: Riftmaker + tank and HP items
[1:56:40] Skimmi: @ipav999 have you tried Malignance yet?
[1:56:48] tobyteemo: dmg on auto attack
[1:56:59] tobyteemo: look on skipper effect
[1:57:04] tobyteemo: ahh yeah
[1:57:20] LtChezo: i dont think fandom is updated
[1:58:34] tobyteemo: cool feeling if u manage to solve teemo s14
[1:58:45] suppaahh: i heard titanic is mad good right now
[1:58:54] LtChezo: RoA isnt mythic anymore so you could build it for tank and ap
[1:59:43] tobyteemo: @LtChezo true
[1:59:50] tobyteemo: roa instead of jaksho
[1:59:54] gnabaer: but the nice pictures, they payed a poor artist some money so they gonna use it!
[2:00:11] gexovedder: I like AD Teemo with: Berserkers, Terminus, BoTRK, Kraken, Spirit Visage and hurricane.
[2:00:26] adrean555: whats your highest rank you've hit
[2:00:54] tobyteemo: i see
[2:01:07] tobyteemo: yeah that's why kekoyle was so needed
[2:01:11] tobyteemo: it was so good for ad teemo
[2:01:41] samwlse: terminus seem ok for teamfighter with hurricane but not that good for 1v1
[2:01:44] tobyteemo: no idea
[2:01:44] Skimmi: @gexovedder why spriti visage on teemo? Isn't the passive completely useless?
[2:02:25] tobyteemo: ia ctually feel like with all these changes teemo got hit hardest with diversity
[2:02:39] tobyteemo: its like every change was against teemo having diversity. riftmaker, kekoyle, silvermere dawn, warmog, etc
[2:03:02] Skimmi: lots of new mage items that seem good on him though, I think AP teemo will be super strong
[2:03:07] supab_priprem: TEEMO!!!!!
[2:04:02] tobyteemo: i miss being able to go kraken slayer on nahsor riftmaker teemo to penetrate
[2:04:06] samwlse: in low skill, teemo winrate went waay up. since they get hit by traps
[2:04:08] tobyteemo: now we can't without sustain
[2:04:22] gexovedder: @Skimmi the 25% healing increase and lil magic resistance help to stay alive
[2:09:02] samwlse: :3
[2:09:08] supab_priprem: :3
[2:11:27] Nemo_SWE: clean

[2:15:58] Bey_Company: this is not hight mmr :D
[2:16:05] LtChezo: jayce isnt
[2:16:48] gligursz: whats considered high mmr
[2:17:25] suppaahh: why rageblade instead kraken, when kraken does more dmg
[2:17:28] LtChezo: i wasnt paying attention during this loading screen, but there were last season challengers in his last game
[2:17:47] manny_senpai: everyone is crying in bot lane
[2:17:54] manny_senpai: people saying its really bad down there
[2:18:04] Sarnyroth: Copers
[2:18:08] Sarnyroth: ADC is fine
[2:18:23] LtChezo: eclipse is still in the game
[2:18:54] LtChezo: like old stormrazer
[2:19:20] supab_priprem: nooooooooo!!
[2:19:52] Skimmi: I hate how bot lane works these days.. either they're 15/0 or 0/15, there is no in between
[2:20:24] suppaahh: just get kraken
[2:21:40] Skimmi: they all just ignore the yasuo, wth

[3:18:37] SaymonFV: jajajajdsa
[3:19:29] xxpops: Thoughts on top lane reworked map?
[3:19:35] BurakBaykal2: i wanted to ask this sorry , Does it make sense to deal sudden damage instead of continuous damage?
[3:20:22] EG_Kel: ipavNoted
[3:20:47] HalfaXan: NOTED
[3:21:01] Aldurfus: pekinNOTED
[3:21:13] EG_Kel: @Aldurfus SoCute
[3:21:15] nchhcn9: yeah double penetration seems good
[3:21:24] Aldurfus: @EG_Kel peepoCute
[3:21:31] claudelfin: don't talk to us in caps
[3:22:18] xxpops: @BurakBaykal2 "what is best build for burst damage"
[3:23:25] xxpops: I think he was confused because of how you worded it
[3:23:51] BurakBaykal2: I tried this , liand first, rabadon second, Q max and shadow flame 3rd item.
[3:25:08] BurakBaykal2: auto-Q-Auto hited almost 1.4k but This time I keep losing continois damage.
[3:26:30] T0asTee: the passives are different so u get double ramp
[3:27:03] xxpops: I stopped playing teemo after s7 but I still come here to watch Ivan cook builds, love it
[3:28:25] feargg: But do they really stack, because you have to keep in mind that it's rito LUL it might be named differently but still be the same effect
[3:29:48] T0asTee: have u checked the rune that replaced stopwatch
[3:30:02] BurakBaykal2: did u see shadow flame stats ?
[3:30:28] xxpops: is stop watch finally gone?
[3:30:35] Aldurfus: @xxpops no
[3:30:38] Skimmi: @BurakBaykal2 I think Luden's Companion and Stormsurge sound pretty good if you want to go burst teemo, haven't tried it though
[3:30:40] xxpops: nods, ty
[3:30:43] Aldurfus: seekers is stopwatch now
[3:30:57] T0asTee: avarice is extra dmg to minions, force is extra adaptive, skill is extra skillpoint
[3:31:16] feargg: 1) gain 40g basically 2) 20 adaptive force for 60s 3) free skill point
[3:31:46] Aldurfus: just give the gold KEKW
[3:31:57] Skimmi: yeah I never understood that lol
[3:32:06] disciplinaiguallibertad: Pyke passive does if your inventory is full lol.
[3:32:20] T0asTee: the pyke passive is probably flavor + feels good to hear the gold coming in
[3:33:19] JonSingerSARGENT: Pyke passive is my favorite active to activate. SeemsGood
[3:33:28] Pitju99: every battle royale is a war and it's in there
[3:33:35] BurakBaykal2: BurakBaykal2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! thanks for all answers and ur patience. i just started the game 9.season and still try to figure it out. much love from tr Mr Ipav <3
[3:33:40] richieecoool: whoa banshee veil has 120 ap
[3:34:02] T0asTee: and u def know people will ask "where did i get so much money" if it wasnt a thing
[3:34:22] T0asTee: ghost exhaust taric
[3:34:27] T0asTee: lethimcook
[3:34:46] BurakBaykal2: i quess, fiora dodged :)
[3:35:04] T0asTee: "new" champion
[3:35:05] T0asTee: Kappa
[3:36:38] Aldurfus: @T0asTee any champ after like reksai is new to me still KEKW
[3:37:08] BurakBaykal2: what about naafiri :D :D @Aldurfus
[3:37:13] TnTizz: i love to pick teemo and always declare, but more than often my team still wont go tank - how do i get over this?
[3:37:38] Pitju99: ipav what do u think about vanguard being added to league? Was it necessary?
[3:37:48] Aldurfus: viego kind of does that
[3:37:53] T0asTee: what will draven do for 30 seconds
[3:37:55] T0asTee: Kappa
[3:37:55] Aldurfus: but steals from enemies lol
[3:38:19] feargg: Then there would be misunderstanding either you wouldn't know if you have enough gold to buy the item yet (if you get gold once you get to the shop) or you'll get the message about the money but the amount you already have doesn't change (if you get the gold right away and only get the message at the shop)
[3:38:36] disciplinaiguallibertad: New support champ?  But we just got Hwei, lol.
[3:38:44] motojudge: @T0asTee maybe swap instead of borrow? xD
[3:38:52] BurakBaykal2: @Pitju99 exactly game is need it. in west server so many cheater
[3:39:16] Skimmi: that actually sounds good lmao
[3:39:36] Skimmi: but imagine how tilting for your teammates lol
[3:39:43] Aldurfus: drive by shrooms
[3:39:44] Skimmi: taking their items away
[3:40:40] TnTizz: is terminus the new statikk shiv ?
[3:40:43] richieecoool: is shroom build not good ?
[3:40:56] T0asTee: @TnTizz its the defense/pen on hit adc item

[3:43:31] Aldurfus: 1/2 true damage KEKW
[3:44:47] setoscoffee: love the nickname
[3:46:22] TnTizz: i like the look of space groove teemo but the attack animation feels delayed
[3:46:47] T0asTee: i think you can do one at a time and your team gets the buff that shreds towers
[3:47:04] T0asTee: if you  kill one of them it shields the others and makes them stronk
[3:47:44] T0asTee: ICANT
[3:47:48] T0asTee: she tried
[3:47:50] Aldurfus: KEKL
[3:48:10] berliouz1: she was doin her best
[3:48:10] PKyliael: the dragon is drunk
[3:48:47] berliouz1: on gwen ofc
[3:49:11] berliouz1: feels like only on gwen he is good
[3:49:38] N00BiX: heartsteel + riftmaker might be a good combo
[3:51:30] T0asTee: how so can u explain why top isnt worth now?
[3:52:18] T0asTee: ig top prio is good for voidgrub but not worth ganking for
[3:54:38] o0invader0o: do you think those new ap item will make teemo worth playing full ap more ?
[3:54:45] Aldurfus: KEKW
[3:54:53] richieecoool: mother wat LUL

[4:18:32] HalfaXan: build seems good maybe different runes
[4:18:35] Pitju99: liandry is so good now
[4:19:46] HalfaXan: hexplate is bussin
[4:20:29] Pitju99: I've heard very good things about jaksho 3rd on bruiser champions, maybe taimo can do that
[4:21:24] Pitju99: like liandry bork jaksho into optional maybe
[4:22:09] Pitju99: cause both of those items scale on enemy's hp so it's always gonna do some dmg
[4:22:13] matiko280: did they finally remove mythics?
[4:22:30] Pitju99: yes
[4:22:37] matiko280: thank god
[4:23:34] HalfaXan: but items are still synergy focused which is a bit odd in theorycrafting

[5:01:16] T0asTee: KEKL
[5:02:00] HalfaXan: nothing mid is even easier
[5:02:02] purifish: is it me or is malignance made for teemo
[5:02:31] ivanmalvin: yea thought that it was perfect when I saw it
[5:02:38] Aldurfus: @purifish pretty good on fiddle
[5:02:54] T0asTee: i was in a game with karthus jungle spamming their ult off cd with malignance storm and just chunking everyone for 50% KEKL
[5:02:59] PhilosoPhiddle: @purifish It is hard to think of champs that could use it better than teemo
[5:03:03] ivanmalvin: malignant, torment, horizon focus... lots of shroom cdr
[5:03:10] purifish: @T0asTee KEKW
[5:03:20] purifish: @PhilosoPhiddle yeaa

[5:04:38] T0asTee: none of the new items seem to show how much dmg they hav edone
[5:05:06] Aldurfus: yeah seems like they don't track for any items now

[5:10:03] RlPbyKampfotter: I still enjoy playing heartsteel with lethal tempo
[5:10:59] pikapika_666_: the new rift is more spacious

[5:17:10] pikapika_666_: @RlPbyKampfotter at least tampon?
[5:17:46] RlPbyKampfotter: @pikapika_666_ don’t get it tbh
[5:18:13] Pitju99: there is so much magicpen in the game now it's kind of nuts
[5:18:24] richieecoool: did they pick aatrox cause of teemo ?
[5:18:25] RlPbyKampfotter: seeing that Seraphine I really want to play PTA Sera again…

[5:20:55] PhilosoPhiddle: PSA: RIOT Games here: We would like to state iPav needs to play Teemo the way RIot wants. Not the way iPav wants. We know fun, and fun is our way or no way. TY Have Nice day. Get Wrecked
[5:21:05] RlPbyKampfotter: Teemo can’t be as aggressive atm to take that pos
[5:22:11] RlPbyKampfotter: in s13 hybrid Tank onhit Teemo was okay
[5:22:21] pikapika_666_: run
[5:22:33] richieecoool: LUL
[5:22:40] RlPbyKampfotter: run away cause Sylas is beyond broken
[5:22:46] richieecoool: yup
[5:23:04] richieecoool: yeah even with full build late game teemo weak
[5:23:14] PhilosoPhiddle: 0 - 10 Milio ?
[5:23:21] RlPbyKampfotter: cause Teemo doesn’t have enough HP and movementspeed?
[5:23:31] Pitju99: there has to be a cost for shroom impact though
[5:23:52] Pitju99: imagine if teemo could 1v1 and also have 700dmg shrooms
[5:23:59] T0asTee: but even teemo says "ill scout ahead"
[5:24:04] T0asTee: you have to scout not fight Kappa
[5:24:26] richieecoool: ward champion just land shrrom everywhere LUL
[5:24:36] SocialMoonCat: yep
[5:24:42] SocialMoonCat: with dark harvest
[5:24:48] RlPbyKampfotter: I mean you could play duo with jgl and go jgl Teemo 😂
[5:24:49] Aldurfus: shroom farmer Smoge
[5:24:52] Edugator1: @ipav999 ok whap champions are the best in the new season?
[5:25:01] RlPbyKampfotter: double jgl is broken but not in high Elo
[5:25:01] Edugator1: what
[5:25:28] T0asTee: time to main support teemo
[5:25:46] RlPbyKampfotter: Teemo Support? don’t think that will work
[5:25:56] SocialMoonCat: @RlPbyKampfotter it does
[5:26:00] pikapika_666_: and "imaginery" (hybrid) build?
[5:26:27] RlPbyKampfotter: @socialmooncat Double jgl works in high Elo!?
[5:26:36] Pitju99: @socialmooncat the problem is you have to lane and teemo can't lane against bot laners
[5:28:27] RlPbyKampfotter: my jungle just locked Teemo
[5:28:30] RlPbyKampfotter: i cry
[5:28:55] pikapika_666_: :)
[5:29:04] Pitju99: hourglass costs so much now
[5:29:13] Pitju99: isnt it a really big nerf to it
[5:29:30] HalfaXan: Terminus
[5:30:10] RlPbyKampfotter: gonna lurk now - can s1 clip important info about Teemo? need to watch that later 🫣
[5:30:44] HalfaXan: try some nashor hexplate terminus it’s bussin
[5:31:01] SocialMoonCat: the normally go Morellonomicon 2nd item
[5:31:05] Pitju99: my idea was nashor kraken into jaksho 3rd
[5:31:28] Pitju99: and liandry for shrooms late game
[5:31:37] SocialMoonCat: 2200 gold 90 ap 15ability haste with anti heal
[5:32:06] Pitju99: Blade doesnt speed you up anymore
[5:32:11] Pitju99: it just slows
[5:32:16] HalfaXan: I like the nashor with the hexplate
[5:32:33] HalfaXan: and terminus because of the synergy
[5:33:39] Pitju99: well either blade or nashor depending on matchup
[5:33:53] Pitju99: nashor for snowball squishy blade into tankier
[5:34:01] Pitju99: is usually my thought process
[5:34:44] Pitju99: they have to make mistakes yes
[5:34:50] Pitju99: but they will though
[5:34:59] HalfaXan: that’s understandable
[5:35:27] SanderAntreas: man I dislike new bork passive, slow on 1st strike feels like ass. Like you slow them at the start, and then they just run away, instead of being able to chase them after 3 autos
[5:35:49] Pitju99: yeah I think bork passive got so much weaker
[5:36:06] Pitju99: its like iceborn now but on 5x the cooldown
[5:36:07] Bluichu: you should have 2 clients open in case you get filled
[5:36:38] Pitju99: old bork movespeed steal was really broken in comparison
[5:38:24] Pitju99: I just don't think the one time 30% slow is that strong
[5:38:26] SanderAntreas: or you're facing a tank in this season Kappa
[5:38:49] HalfaXan: @pitju99 it is on teemo
[5:38:51] Pitju99: cause it goes on cooldown, old one if it popped you got a much bigger buff
[5:39:26] Pitju99: it's like PTA except they step back from first auto and no more PTA for a bit
[5:39:38] SanderAntreas: I faced one ornn yesterday, the guy got 150 mr and 700 magic shield with 2 items, I gave up on dealing damage
[5:39:57] HalfaXan: @pitju99 low elo takes my dude
[5:40:37] orluas: this draft
[5:41:15] Pitju99: I'm not saying it's bad just that the old one was better imo. still better than not having it
[5:42:45] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[5:43:05] HalfaXan: also an worth try
[5:43:38] HalfaXan: maybe go bork jaksho and then more onhit
[5:43:49] Pitju99: wait old bork was 30 second cooldown and now it's 15? hmm
[5:43:55] xxpops: everyone saying tanks super busted atm,  there's probably a good tankmo build out there
[5:43:58] Pitju99: I thought old one was less cd
[5:44:23] Aldurfus: scimitar the only qss item now?
[5:44:32] YouAreCuteXD: has he tried the on his item yet? terminus?
[5:44:38] Pitju99: ok then maybe current bork is better
[5:44:43] sandouchiwa: did u try manco build with botrk terminus second, then tankee items with lethal tempo
[5:44:48] YouAreCuteXD: oh there it is
[5:44:52] Pitju99: I didnt look at the cooldown change
[5:46:00] sandouchiwa: cuz terminus gives tankiness more u hit so lethal is useful
[5:46:36] Pitju99: well tempo is only good if they engage into you
[5:47:54] Timaster5: ban gnar xD
[5:48:28] Pitju99: it sucks in lane really bad but still better than harvest
[5:48:33] Pitju99: that rune is a joke
[5:48:59] kleentz: Does terminus stacks faster with rageblade?
[5:49:10] Marcsvas: is cdr boots good on teemo now? BibleThump
[5:49:10] AnimeSkinsLobbyist: hey, what about ridtmaker on teemo?
[5:49:23] AnimeSkinsLobbyist: riftmaker
[5:51:42] YouAreCuteXD: what about hail of blades to help stack terminus
[5:52:31] SanderAntreas: theres cheap gauntlet still
[5:53:30] Pitju99: every auto slowing is 10x better than having to proc sheen
[5:53:38] Pitju99: not even close
[5:54:13] SanderAntreas: thats why riot removed it @Pitju99 the effect is extremely annoying to play agains
[5:54:24] Endoskeleton: nice one ipav
[5:54:34] Aldurfus: jungler modCheck
[5:54:36] KappaMikay: any favorite builds yet? or does lack of cool down feels bad on teemo?
[5:54:40] purifish: share exp ez
[5:54:41] Endoskeleton: good thing ur team is still inting
[5:54:48] Pitju99: @sanderantreas yeah of course it's a broken concept
[5:54:49] Endoskeleton: ghost flash to turret
[5:54:52] Endoskeleton: oh no he got 6
[5:54:54] YouAreCuteXD: plus doesn't bork slow on first auto now anyway? you can proc it as much as iceborn
[5:55:03] SanderAntreas: poppy spending some quality time 3Head
[5:55:05] Endoskeleton: lololololololo
[5:55:09] Endoskeleton: loil\olololol
[5:55:16] KappaMikay: pav o p
[5:55:18] purifish: wth
[5:55:27] Endoskeleton: he still got u??
[5:55:43] TheSoccerkill: he wasted 5 minuts of his game XD
[5:55:43] purifish: BORK game?
[5:56:12] purifish: what
[5:56:20] purifish: is this a new acc
[5:57:27] Endoskeleton: thankfully jungle doesnt decide how top goes even with multiple failed ganks :)
[5:57:45] Marcsvas: wtf how ur tower almost fell?
[5:58:32] Pitju99: like 30 minions were attacking it at some point
[6:02:09] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:02:23] SanderAntreas: KEKShake

[6:05:18] Oplia_: LOL
[6:05:25] KuberaMei: Yoo, guys. How the patch feels?
[6:05:48] Endoskeleton: no more herald recall with it?
[6:06:21] SanderAntreas: @Endoskeleton it gives one-time herald recall to all people helping take herald
[6:07:05] Endoskeleton: ok thx
[6:08:39] mrbexsi: crazy one shot build is Statikk Shiv+ Stormrazor+ Rapid Firecannon+ Infinity Edge+ Trinity Force u can test it on teemo its crazy dude dmg
[6:08:41] nudgebear: why AD this game ipav?
[6:08:58] nudgebear: is it better vs sion?
[6:09:11] nudgebear: sorry if noob question
[6:09:18] YouAreCuteXD: need bork to ever kill sion
[6:09:33] SanderAntreas: @mrbexsi you aint one-shotting anyone if you take those items on teemo, you would have to do at least 4 autos to kill someone squishy
[6:11:21] Pitju99: these kraken crits are so big
[6:12:01] Endoskeleton: m y theory is they removed that so ppl dont complain about op items
[6:12:04] mrbexsi: @SanderAntreas if you don't believe it, just test it in training, it's not balanced shit
[6:13:13] SanderAntreas: asking to test in training is not very respectable argument abount one-shotting someone in a real game, hope you get that @mrbexsi
[6:13:54] Pitju99: the kraken got so much stronger
[6:15:30] Pitju99: if you had cut down as well sion would melt
[6:15:55] mrbexsi: @SanderAntreas this assembly is used by challenger
[6:16:44] SanderAntreas: @SanderAntreas sorry don't know anyone named challenger
[6:16:52] mrbexsi: @mrbexsi ad lb\ahry
[6:17:11] HalfaXan: it’s used by shoemaker but it’s mostly a fun snowball build on lb
[6:17:30] Pitju99: teemo is not an assasin lol
[6:17:39] SanderAntreas: and what makes you think it would work on shitmo, champ without dashes or cc
[6:17:47] jordyutopia: rageblade broken
[6:17:56] SanderAntreas: you get into auto range with those items, you die
[6:18:01] TheSoccerkill: on tanks this build is good but on 5 man ap team this build aint good right?
[6:18:10] GrylloBH: they have removed the KEKoyle?
[6:18:15] HalfaXan: and jaksho is a great item
[6:18:41] Caststriker: What about the Terminus item or whatever its called, is it any good?
[6:18:51] bean______: what tank item woould u go ? heartsteel sucks right?
[6:18:52] GrylloBH: did poppy miss her ult?
[6:19:00] nudgebear: ah thank this build is great for split pushing

[6:30:24] Endoskeleton: i support u
[6:30:45] Pitju99: I think it is OK but only in the late game
[6:31:00] Pitju99: if you really need pen I don't see why not
[6:31:01] Teik1066: You know it's going to be good when streamer brings out paint

[6:32:46] istroopy: are u planning on playing ranked?
[6:32:48] ohSwab: !youtube
[6:34:31] HalfaXan: SeemsGood
[6:34:32] Endoskeleton: what champ do you ban? ipav
[6:34:56] HalfaXan: cryptbloom is garbagio
[6:35:01] T0asTee: how about horizon focus
[6:35:08] Endoskeleton: toastee ur still alive??
[6:35:11] bean______: worst top matchup for teemo? varus?
[6:35:21] pupsikxs: Ban varus?. Is he that op?.
[6:35:32] T0asTee: its a big aoe vision rather than just 1 champ that gets hit
[6:35:44] bean______: @pupsikxs AP varus isnt that good anymore, but AD IS OP ATM
[6:35:45] Endoskeleton: yh that would make u a mobile ward placer
[6:35:57] aaronnnotiron: horizon focus dont work on q btw
[6:36:09] aaronnnotiron: teemo q range is 680 < 700
[6:36:13] purifish: does it even work on R
[6:36:18] HalfaXan: I don’t like being a ward
[6:36:26] Pitju99: it used to have exception for traps
[6:36:34] pupsikxs: Oh  big thanks
[6:36:58] ohSwab: pistol instead of lyandries is better
[6:37:06] HalfaXan: when I started playing teemo was a aa champ and imma play him like that
[6:37:18] T0asTee: how about zaz'zak Kappa
[6:37:34] HalfaXan: zaza CiGrip
[6:37:57] nurse_irl: With how much AP zhonyas nad banshees give now, DCap is even more efficient. I say leave out nashors if full AP. Hard to auto much
[6:38:01] Endoskeleton: its support item
[6:38:03] T0asTee: teemo can pivot to shroom farmer with zaz zak support
[6:38:08] aaronnnotiron: have you tried luden gun q max playstyle?
[6:38:40] T0asTee: Kappa
[6:38:40] Pitju99: it's the support item
[6:38:43] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:38:49] T0asTee: he is KEKL
[6:39:37] T0asTee: his ult is a ward that gets sweeped KEKL
[6:40:43] T0asTee: really? i feel like the companion is stronger cause it has single target
[6:41:00] Pitju99: it is a bit stronger but still not what teemo is good at
[6:41:03] mrbexsi: Statikk Shiv+ Stormrazor+ Rapid Firecannon+ Infinity Edge+ Trinity Force
[6:41:24] T0asTee: notepad stream HypeSleep
[6:41:52] wingedOracle: each is 120 ap now, they are pretty busted base stats
[6:42:34] T0asTee: is it time to bring back the carrot build KEKL
[6:42:45] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[6:44:18] N00BiX: Jak'Sho?
[6:44:23] pupsikxs: Yea carrot build so much fun
[6:45:09] Pitju99: teemo got the short stick of AP itemization cause his scalings sux
[6:45:16] theshadowninja89: Hello
[6:45:19] Pitju99: and they buffed raw AP
[6:45:25] theshadowninja89: Most of the games u don't need QSS
[6:45:36] theshadowninja89: It's very situational
[6:46:37] theshadowninja89: Almost 3.7k
[6:46:41] HalfaXan: that’s a lot of dmg
[6:46:55] Pitju99: @ipav999 assuming they have more MR than armor, the AD does more
[6:47:19] HalfaXan: good build MYAAA
[6:47:28] theshadowninja89: I am talking about against teams don't have too much CC
[6:47:50] HalfaXan: I think zhonyas is always better then qss besides mord matchup
[6:48:32] theshadowninja89: I mean I prefer movement speed to escape
[6:48:39] theshadowninja89: QSS is against Morder
[6:48:46] theshadowninja89: And some champions like u said
[6:48:53] HalfaXan: yea but only in those qss is better
[6:49:05] HalfaXan: and rare champs aswell
[6:50:07] theshadowninja89: @halfaxan If u are playing correctly and if u have a lot of MS they don't even get a chance to CC u
[6:50:19] theshadowninja89: U need to position in teamfights correct
[6:50:33] aprumolaceral: StareCat
[6:51:09] HalfaXan: well u can bate skills with zhonyas
[6:51:21] Endoskeleton: stop with ur sex auto attack
[6:51:22] HalfaXan: it’s not about getting hit
[6:51:28] Pitju99: @ipav999 I feel like malignance builds always need void staff
[6:51:38] Pitju99: to synerhize penetration
[6:51:51] theshadowninja89: What it gonna be if u put Shadowflame? @ipav999
[6:51:56] CrankeFar: hi iPav , if i wanna just splitpush taimo 24/7 would u recommend onhit with phaserush and demolish?
[6:52:04] theshadowninja89: Shadowflame and Void Stuff together
[6:53:11] theshadowninja89: Real Teemo main counts.... 1,2,3,4.... 1,2,3,4 LUL
[6:53:22] mantis3030: but Mal dmg only if opponent stays at the same spot
[6:53:23] theshadowninja89: Others 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
[6:53:46] theshadowninja89: How about Shadowflame?
[6:53:49] aprumolaceral: gotta be a ninja tobias4
[6:53:52] Pitju99: take off like 200 dmg cause they will move out of the zone
[6:54:27] Endoskeleton: change to deathcap
[6:55:09] theshadowninja89: Shadowflame? @ipav999
[6:55:24] theshadowninja89: Malignance is mandatory on Teemo
[6:55:29] Pitju99: only way to fit dcap is to give up banshees
[6:55:31] theshadowninja89: Shrooms are bombs with this item
[6:55:40] Pitju99: or nashors
[6:55:48] Steki_Z: shadowflame maybe
[6:56:22] Pitju99: thats terrible
[6:56:43] Pitju99: it also doesnt make sense
[6:56:53] Pitju99: it doesnt buff shrooms but it gives shroom cd
[6:57:20] theshadowninja89: Make a test
[6:57:23] theshadowninja89: We will see
[6:57:36] theshadowninja89: Against squishy Shadowflame and Void Stuff will be great
[6:57:58] Pitju99: only way to realistically increase dmg is to give up banshees but thats a cost
[6:58:26] theshadowninja89: How much it will be 500 gold potion?
[6:58:32] theshadowninja89: With it
[6:58:37] Steki_Z: well, shadow kinda excels at low hp enemies
[6:59:01] xshiduaix: lightning staff?
[6:59:08] HalfaXan: paper
[6:59:44] theshadowninja89: I think cryptbloom is for support and some mid laners
[7:00:24] Pitju99: wait morello is 2200 now jeez
[7:01:14] HalfaXan: I think they go some crit infinity build or triforce kraken
[7:01:24] theshadowninja89: But morello isn't giving u health anymore @pitju99
[7:01:52] Pitju99: didnt say it was good just crazy cheap
[7:02:24] HalfaXan: don’t really need cdr
[7:02:33] HalfaXan: on onhit teemo
[7:05:20] CrankeFar: when would you recomend pta vs prush? sorry im new :)
[7:05:27] Pitju99: the more I think about it, malignance is prolly not viable without void staff at least late game
[7:05:39] Pitju99: cause the pen is too low
[7:05:48] Pitju99: so for hybrid I wouldnt do it
[7:06:07] Pitju99: could be wrong tho
[7:07:28] Pitju99: liandry is a bit different cause its not just for shroom
[7:07:33] jordyutopia: no hp
[7:07:52] cafeaguado: What about the runes? Pta is the best in this season?
[7:08:16] Breathe234: I thought maybe you were going to t erst Liandry's plus Bork
[7:08:18] HalfaXan: yup
[7:08:21] Pitju99: @cafeaguado runes are 90% matchup dependent so it should be mostly the same
[7:08:22] Breathe234: *test
[7:08:23] HalfaXan: and nashors
[7:08:34] Pitju99: I think jaksho fits best
[7:08:37] Pitju99: for hybrid
[7:08:54] Pitju99: hexplate seems poopy
[7:09:09] SpringSong: hour glass is too expensive
[7:09:14] cafeaguado: @pitju99 its true
[7:09:16] SpringSong: and rely on team
[7:09:23] Pitju99: the AD from hexplate without kraken is not very useful
[7:09:43] CrankeFar: @pitju99 if im new to playing is there a vid on ipavs yt where i Can get an explanstion on when to Pick What Runes?
[7:09:45] rj12h8: rj12h8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[7:10:44] Pitju99: @crankefar I'm not sure there is one but there used to be a "teemo book" that should be good enough
[7:10:52] Pitju99: runes didnt change that much
[7:11:43] CrankeFar: im new and play silver-gold so i doubt it matters much, but i wanna learn it. is the teemo book on yt?
[7:13:20] Pitju99: I think your onhit bork kraken game was pretty spot on
[7:14:02] exxantares: Hello!!
[7:14:11] xxbadghostxx_: is this ranked?
[7:14:11] CrankeFar: do shrooms even do much with on hit build?
[7:14:20] xLeSeigneurBalekx: my build is nashoor>zonya>banshee/void staff> rabadon with PTA and the runes that reduce zonya to 80 sc
[7:14:25] TheSoccerkill: @xxbadghostxx_ no
[7:14:35] Pitju99: the most efficient way to do that is ult hunter
[7:14:43] Pitju99: then you dont have to invest in a crappy item
[7:14:55] Pitju99: just get ult hunter
[7:15:07] SpringSong: @xLeSeigneurBalekx banshe+zhonya cost 6400 too expensive
[7:15:52] xLeSeigneurBalekx: @SpringSong ye but it's so good, they can't catch you with banshee
[7:16:11] HalfaXan: thats crappy
[7:16:17] Pitju99: wow thats stats are low
[7:16:27] Pitju99: like so low
[7:16:28] SpringSong: banshe enough to me zhonya is more like if your team strong
[7:16:42] HalfaXan: because of lucian and stuff probably
[7:16:51] SpringSong: nerf deserved cuz adc's asasin everyone was rush this bulshit
[7:17:21] SpringSong: lol that malp looks so smol
[7:17:24] SpringSong: too cute
[7:18:10] istroopy: teemo grasp is so disgusting freljo2Xdd

[7:18:36] horadin_uwu: viennaPoggies
[7:18:53] HalfaXan: PEEPOG
[7:20:12] SvenElof: you need 300 more health outside of warmogs
[7:20:35] SpringSong: well its easy to get tho
[7:20:52] Pitju99: they nerfed warmog rush when nobody was doing it KEKW
[7:21:00] SpringSong: kekw

[7:37:24] DoubleNeilix: tickle rat
[7:37:26] theshadowninja89: Because it's AD

[8:20:19] Bluichu: ni haowdy! @brownemonke
[8:20:20] SzDredd: teetoHi
[8:20:29] portiguera: is that small magic damage to the tower, the new objective buff?
[8:20:41] YouAreCuteXD: yes, also the grubs that spawn
[8:21:14] BrowneMonke: can u not blind tf stun?
[8:21:15] SpringSong: oy oy oy
[8:21:23] Born2BKing21: common fizz W
[8:21:33] SpringSong: @BrowneMonke no blind not work on skill
[8:22:03] YouAreCuteXD: yes you can blind tf w but you gotta be ral fast
[8:22:54] Bluichu: q has cast time, tf card does not
[8:23:19] portiguera: tf🤝kayn
[8:23:37] Bluichu: I don't think you can blind him in time
[8:26:21] Bluichu: PikaRamen
[8:27:54] Pitju99: if you blind TF red card the aoe still hits you?
[8:28:13] AeroTheFallenAngel: !uptime
[8:33:01] proxy1vlc: !opgg
[8:33:07] proxy1vlc: !rank
[8:38:09] Pitju99: comparing shadowflame to malignance, I think malignance just does more
[8:38:28] Pitju99: you never kill someone without shroom anyway in that build
[8:38:59] Pitju99: but even bursty you need a shroom hit to kill someone from full
[8:40:23] Pitju99: shadowflame has synergy with malignance
[8:40:32] Pitju99: but malignance good on its own
[8:41:27] Pitju99: heartsteel lost a lot of numbers
[8:41:51] Pitju99: I think it lost damage and stacks slower
[8:42:02] FuryRespect: Does anyone have any idea when the urf mode is coming?
[8:42:20] Pitju99: and no haste
[8:43:46] Pitju99: wits might be interesting
[8:43:49] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[8:44:34] Pitju99: also heartsteel gives you a lot of size now which is really bad
[8:45:15] Pitju99: it gave as mythic passive
[8:45:18] Pitju99: not the same
[8:45:24] Pitju99: and less
[8:46:35] Pitju99: warmog should be better
[8:49:15] Pitju99: I don't think so
[8:49:28] Pitju99: you also get the effect
[8:51:24] Bluichu: RaccAttack
[8:51:37] Pitju99: what happened to perfect timing?
