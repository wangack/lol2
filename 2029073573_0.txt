[1:37:51] NvidiaYellowClaw: you clicked 2x

[1:43:48] Edge2G: FUCK I MISSED IT
[1:43:52] Kennyl4d: just open your pants daddy
[1:43:53] Y0UTU8E2012: Stop talking to chat, they bunch of silver noobs
[1:43:54] chilloriwill: Yet I were right, when you did it as I told you, you started to move it towards turret :D
[1:43:56] Billllllyyy__: ive had team mates run it backwards, they turnt it around and went into the jgl
[1:44:11] brunchmenus: o7
[1:44:15] TheLastShadow45: that last one wasn't bugged though
[1:44:22] chilloriwill: No you controlled it forwards towards enemy turret, not yours.
[1:44:24] chilloriwill: .........
[1:44:29] styroslol: Clueless its not bugged
[1:44:29] NvidiaYellowClaw: Its cuz your not on top of herald

[1:45:00] brunchmenus: yep Ok
[1:45:01] NvidiaYellowClaw: NAH you need to click
[1:45:02] Squigg: no its pointing south
[1:45:02] chilloriwill: you moved your mouse
[1:45:07] TheLastShadow45: Cause of the camera change
[1:45:08] NvidiaYellowClaw: You need to click to change
[1:45:09] oh_vacancy: NO HE DIDNT MOVE THE MOUSE
[1:45:12] oh_vacancy: ITS IN THE CENTER
[1:45:13] TheLastShadow45: that one was the camera change
[1:45:13] chilloriwill: as I said.
[1:45:17] NvidiaYellowClaw: You need to click so it changes, you dont get it cowsep xD
[1:45:18] Fathai95: IT SNAPPED TO THE HERALD
[1:45:19] Billllllyyy__: it offsets the screen and moves the mouse
[1:45:21] Edge2G: try keeping the mouse backwards all the way
[1:45:22] Squigg: OH NO YOU DI'NT
[1:45:26] Fathai95: It snapped to the herald forward
[1:45:41] Totalko: Your mouse pointer is at the back side of the Herald, that we can agree to. I don't know which way your mouse itself is facing tho Keepo
[1:45:42] chilloriwill: fact is, your mouse
[1:45:48] oh_vacancy: Exactly its shitty
[1:45:52] ddmess: its not working as intended lol
[1:45:54] chilloriwill: when the herald runs past your mouse, what then?
[1:45:54] TheLastShadow45: that one is fucked, but normally you have to left click after you enter
[1:45:57] chilloriwill: it changes diredction
[1:45:59] hyphymike2: its bugged, hes an idiot
[1:45:59] ddmess: and ure letting everybody tilt u with their 10 iq
[1:46:00] Mr_Aek: camera move put your mouse above it
[1:46:01] Kennyl4d: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:46:06] OpTic_Bool: user error
[1:46:09] chugachufa: Did you left click when the arrow went up?
[1:46:12] chilloriwill: when it runs past your mouse
[1:46:17] chilloriwill: it changes direction
[1:46:21] Fathai95: wait, rewind a bit cowsep
[1:46:22] DumbHippy: I’d rewatch this whole thing again on YouTube for 45+ minutes of you flaming this dude
[1:46:25] Squigg: it cant be where you initially click it thats silly
[1:46:27] TheLastShadow45: not just point, you have to left click after entering
[1:46:27] chilloriwill: Thats not what I said xd
[1:46:28] uddertastic: What you gonna do about it Stare
[1:46:28] Totalko: I KNOW WHAT HAPPEND!!!!!
[1:46:31] brunchmenus: i like learning with cowdad cowBully
[1:46:36] Mr_Aek: I think when the camera moved automatically it moved your mouse to up
[1:46:42] chilloriwill: THE HERALD RUNS PAST YOUR MOUSE
[1:46:44] oh_vacancy: Its so badly coded
[1:46:46] chilloriwill: AND DIRECTION CHANGES
[1:46:50] Squigg: it might be cos your mouse cursor is too far away from the herald
[1:46:50] Totalko: IT IS SECRETLY MUNDO IN DISCUISE! And you know... MUNDO goes where he pleases.
[1:46:51] styroslol: Clap Clap finally
[1:46:55] IkuyaGB: Hopefullly it wont happen more
[1:46:58] Fathai95: damn PEOPLE really cant accept that riot has a bug in 2024?
[1:47:01] Kennyl4d: daddy you took this too personally
[1:47:01] Fathai95: BITCHES
[1:47:04] L0rd_FarQuadz: yoo rift is a skill shot now xD
[1:47:04] frenszisz: Still on this lol
[1:47:08] Fathai95: we have had bugs in the last 15 years
[1:47:15] Fathai95: HOW HARD IS IT to believe that this is a bug?
[1:47:15] Joshinon: @Fathai95 fr
[1:47:18] Overmonitorw: time to put chill on chill mute lol
[1:47:19] Fathai95: the fuck is this shit?
[1:47:25] Joshinon: it is a bug, ignore it and move on
[1:47:27] brunchmenus: click and afk YEP
[1:47:29] Fathai95: its 2024 and suddenly RIOT is bug free?
[1:47:29] oh_vacancy: until youre cruising
[1:47:29] Edge2G: i just see something working as intended KEK
[1:47:34] oh_vacancy: then you can move that sht
[1:47:34] Fathai95: ?????????????
[1:47:37] brid96: yOu GoTa ChAnGe dIrEcTiOn BrO
[1:47:38] TheLastShadow45: That one was fucked sure, but normally you left click to change it's direction before it starts the charge
[1:47:38] Mr_Aek: no I mean the mouse didn't move, but when the camera panned forward the new mouse position was above the herald
[1:47:40] SadeqD1: but you kept pointing north
[1:47:40] Fathai95: guys you cant be real?
[1:47:44] chilloriwill: you ran past
[1:47:52] brunchmenus: i have no idea why that happened still
[1:47:57] styroslol: @chilloriwill bro stfu already KEKL
[1:47:58] chilloriwill: You will learn!
[1:47:59] Kennyl4d: why take it so personal man
[1:48:01] IkuyaGB: I dont think people are saying riot cant have bugs they just wwnt an answer for everything lol
[1:48:02] Kennyl4d: just chill
[1:48:03] LukasBravim: Isso também aconteceu comigo, é um bug
[1:48:04] chilloriwill: Stfu styro :D
[1:48:13] Joshinon: "they" theres like, 1 and a half person who said it wasnt a bug
[1:48:19] oh_vacancy: @brunchmenus something is going on with it when you leave the circle with your cursor before it starts cruising.
[1:48:23] jahnul: !wallper
[1:48:24] chilloriwill: I never said it werent a bug
[1:48:36] IkuyaGB: There were like 4 people saying it was cowsep and not a bug
[1:49:05] m_ayndin: cin
[1:49:22] Kennyl4d: send this clip to riot games
[1:49:27] Mr_Aek: yeah thats dumb af
[1:49:33] LukasBravim: I see in many games this bug. Incluse w me
[1:49:35] brunchmenus: 2
[1:49:36] Squigg: yeah i think your mouse just needs to stay inside its circle it cant detect a direction when your mouse is too far away so it just goes whatever
[1:49:37] NvidiaYellowClaw: You just mastered the rift herald sidestep Kappa
[1:49:37] Recall_the_world: Again what Im wondering is if its like Sion charge.  it charges the direction the chracter as facing when activated and charges based on how mouse is manipulated? have you tried testing if its similar?
[1:49:38] Mr_Aek: they need to make it more intuitive for sure
[1:49:39] TheLastShadow45: the only thing I can think of is the time it's pointing at the grove that for that small .1 seconds you accidently left clicked
[1:49:39] salihreyiz100: bro come 1vs1
[1:49:45] Totalko: In all seriousness... The real reason is... it is indeed bugs that cause this. I can shortly explain how this occurs. When the game starts you have to play your standard game, and at a certain moment 3 purple bugs apear and they have to be killed. Later another 3 of those purple bastards apear. Moments later the Rift Herald spawns in this same location. If these little purple bugs have not been killed they infest the Herald and this is what bugs the Herald. Then the result is what we now seen.
[1:49:47] Edge2G: you have literally never used rumble ult before
[1:49:47] uddertastic: COPIUM if you say so...
[1:50:11] salihreyiz100: master vs master
[1:50:15] salihreyiz100: comeeeee
[1:50:18] ViolentSword: you have two monitors? maybe your mouse left to the other monitor.
[1:50:19] hetakai: hi is this garena?

[1:59:27] Squigg: you're welcome
[1:59:36] Totalko: @Squigg  There is another option. To not move your hand at all.
[1:59:42] chilloriwill: Fact  is, we will see if cowsep have learnt or not as he charge herald
[1:59:43] chilloriwill: LETS GO
[1:59:44] uddertastic: Damn bro Wow

[4:10:27] Fathai95: its a weird feeling
[4:10:36] Fathai95: yeah hes strong if he got all the combos
[4:10:44] ZeeB__: Its more about positioning imo
[4:10:54] saltyfleas: i exempted the side that is restricted
[4:10:58] ZeeB__: Like you have to play in a position thats beneficial to your abilities
[4:11:10] ZeeB__: For example Q E in chokes etc
[4:11:18] ZeeB__: People are not mindful of what they use and just spam
[4:11:26] ZeeB__: At least imo and what ive seen
[4:11:33] Fathai95: oh yeah no doubt, i have seen mad skill hwei
[4:11:54] ZeeB__: But thats what seperates him really, hes complicated so you'll see very few highly skilled players
[4:12:06] ZeeB__: And most will be just the bad hweis your see
[4:12:17] Fathai95: i guess in a way a good hwei is more like a good zoe
[4:12:22] uddertastic: Plotge
