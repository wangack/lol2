[0:39:01] krazyk47: i feel like hull does enough damage without a sheen item
[0:39:04] elfire2: @TrundleTop1 said every toplaner ever against ksante
[0:39:07] GutenChad: what is the enemy team tho
[0:39:09] trk150866: hola trundletop1

[0:39:30] OhhYeahhMrKrabs: i like the new hull, youre abusing the 5th auto
[0:39:35] OhhYeahhMrKrabs: so you push
[0:39:38] krazyk47: 5th auto op

[0:40:29] OhhYeahhMrKrabs: and thing with terminus is u stack it fast
[0:40:31] elfire2: I think you need to go a duelist item in most cases
[0:40:36] elfire2: after titanic
[0:40:40] GutenChad: void staff after hydra Kappa
[0:40:47] elfire2: so experimental plate, botrk, or triforce probably
[0:41:17] elfire2: that probably depends on matchups though

[1:26:59] nyashnyy_pony: Halo
[1:27:03] Gondor_ftw: as a darius main in master i permaban vayne, most boring matchup and hardest counter
[1:27:03] BenniBoi09: same stuff mr. trundle top
[1:27:05] RenoProod: where are u from
[1:27:06] Kowwallski: Did u try hexplat? @TrundleTop1
[1:27:07] BenniBoi09: depending on matchups
[1:27:10] LangTheBoss: How confident in we are build currently? Still experimental stage?
[1:27:12] TrundleTop1: its okay @Kowwallski
[1:27:15] TrundleTop1: yea @LangTheBoss
[1:27:24] TrundleTop1: cali @RenoProod
[1:27:28] BenniBoi09: yeah still experimental
[1:27:32] BenniBoi09: but i just 1v5 penta
[1:27:33] TrundleTop1: imo nah @UzaLooza
[1:27:34] oolalalalalala: I still feel trinity force is a good item in lmy games
[1:27:42] BenniBoi09: 5 lv above the entire lobby with an experimental build
[1:27:43] xaosikid: When allied champions are disabling BOARDING PARTY, pinging Hullbreaker in your inventory sends out the message "You're too close: ([allied champions])!"
[1:27:50] Gondor_ftw: @Harryan1 lmao what u mean trundle beats almost any champ in a 1v1 except vayne jax fiora
[1:28:00] Gondor_ftw: in lategame
[1:28:02] TrundleTop1: nice @oolalalalalala

[1:28:20] xaosikid: When allied champions are close to entering the radius, the ping will be: "I want to be alone: ([allied champions])." When BOARDING PARTY is active, the ping will be "I'm hunting alone."
[1:28:25] oolalalalalala: and ofcourse that new item, experimental hexplate
[1:28:27] Mavvrix: jax is still a menace , that champ will never stop being broken
[1:28:28] OfficerConradd: !vayne

[1:28:55] Nightbot: dont try to auto q her when she has her cc, you can just q straight up because its unstoppable and will go thru the cc
[1:29:01] BenniBoi09: anyway i recommend you all to try the following and change stuff as you feel but for now this works wonders for me : titanic > bork > hullbreaker > death dance > experimental hexplate

[1:29:53] Nightbot: abuse her early she is weak

[2:55:10] ouzester: @DevBogdan ye items changed
[2:55:16] minimalswitch: @minimalswitch imo it's a nerf
[2:55:20] KAPPE89: Iceborne better than Triforce vs Darius I think
[2:55:29] KAPPE89: if you intend to split and match him
[2:55:29] minimalswitch: it's a good nerf tho
[2:55:33] Sifrid_: You don't get the resist anymore but you get a lot more damage on turrets/champion
[2:55:37] Oswin53: who wants to buy an item that makes your cannon minion harder to kill , the concept is so bad
[2:56:07] Hewyy: Yes!!
[2:56:13] minimalswitch: finally i wont see a illaoi built this item and then win through split push
[2:56:14] KAPPE89: Terminus is a meme

[2:56:41] civicchris: !fiora
[2:56:41] Nightbot: try not to chomp her parry, stay near wall when she ults so she cant get last vital. Not sure if you win level one cause they can just kite. Make sure u do not ult her w extremely important it negates the entire spell everything. DONT q HER W ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.
[2:57:00] spartajohnseb: !rank
[2:57:01] Nightbot: ASCEND YOUR MIND is Diamond IV 12 LP
[2:57:08] Huykashukig: Terminus is good item
[2:57:22] trundlestoothpick: is it just me or does it feel like a fairly balanced first pach compared to the previous seasons
[2:57:22] Oswin53: @minimalswitch well there is a new item but its actually not a new item its jaksho , I think its overstatted and will be bought on a lot bruisers who rely on auto's

[3:56:51] N0avan: !nasus
[3:56:51] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists

[3:57:54] xErik92: wtf that true damage
[3:58:02] Skimmi: you can also just get 1 voidgrub for example and leave, since every one of them is on a separate respawn timer, you don't miss out on anything by taking just 1 and leaving again as top
