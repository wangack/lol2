[0:47:49] oblongbarri: yesterday i realised most people use g and stuff for pingings but ive always just pressed control and then dragged the wheel? how did this happen
[0:47:50] CovenLilith: might just be an emote wheel interactions

[0:48:13] CovenLilith: I use Z for vision ping, and V for the basic blue "anon" ping.  V is also my ping wheel.
[0:48:19] CovenLilith: But I also use WASD to move the screen xD
[0:48:23] MissJenella: I actually have all my pings binded to diff keys LMFAO

[0:49:35] wilfrLd: sneakyJensen Hwei ahead in cs
[0:49:37] CovenLilith: QERT for abilities, I have the cursor moves screen thing turned down so low it basically doesn't exist.  Z for vision.  V for ping wheel.  Y for lock camera.  U used to be Emote Wheel, I for mastery.  F for flash, G for other summoner.
[0:49:52] ash_chiming: oh stunt how I’ve missed you

[6:21:58] ash_chiming: early game mage assasin
[6:23:02] KnoxxiFPS: A s14 guide told me to avoid ranked for the first week and a half to avoid trolls. What do you think of this statement? Just finished placements 3-2. @stunt
[6:23:37] KnoxxiFPS: chat u can put input into this question as well ^
[6:23:41] vogue_hommes: Chatting
[6:23:46] label939: how does elise jump thing work
[6:23:54] vogue_hommes: trolling are going to be around the entire season
[6:24:07] ash_chiming: elise jump makes you untargetable
[6:24:07] PoroPatty: definitely some emotional people in the first week or two
[6:24:16] ash_chiming: then you select an object to come down, like a champ ward or minion
[6:24:25] nogxx: @KnoxxiFPS You can also get trolls in the enemy team. In fact, there's 5 possible ones in the enemy team and only 4 in yours, assuming you aren't one yourself
[6:24:27] BaneBladeV: @KnoxxiFPS maybe rank on secondary account if you don't like the coinflips
[6:24:48] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[6:24:49] rai_roo: @KnoxxiFPS agree with it.

[6:25:33] ash_chiming: if you dont select anytthing you come down where you went up, the center of the circle
[6:25:36] rai_roo: almost every game i have people in my team who didnt play ranked in months
[6:25:41] rai_roo: they just play to try items
[6:25:43] rai_roo: just avoid first week
[6:25:50] rai_roo: especially in low elo
[6:26:06] label939: unless u can 1v9

[6:35:47] savvy_with_it: thoughts on the new support item system?
[6:36:47] PoroPatty: gwen is broken
[6:37:43] KnoxxiFPS: if you look up the accounts of the rioters in charge of changes such as the pinging system you will see they are all silver and below. Mostly bronze.
[6:37:54] savvy_with_it: or just general thoughts on some of the changes that season 14 has brought?
[6:38:47] Mellyersii: wait Elise supp?
[6:39:07] PoroPatty: teamfights over blue are justified now aye?
[6:39:12] Thommenius: @KnoxxiFPS Theyre not doing the changes based on their own experiences, atleast i dont think riot would allow it
[6:39:26] ThomasTheTwink: flash is OP
[6:39:30] BaneBladeV: @KnoxxiFPS as much as I wish that was true, riot auberaun and phreak were both master

[6:40:16] BaneBladeV: yeah
[6:40:46] VIciulol: people from balance team are high elo mostly from what i saw on twitter
[6:40:54] KnoxxiFPS: maybe he wasnt on the team that crucified the pings.
[6:41:17] KnoxxiFPS: would pings be under the balancing team though?
[6:41:26] czekczek1: what do you think of the strength of the baron stages?
[6:42:44] Thommenius: Yeah, I also think that it hurts lower elo players because they are not yet familiar using it
