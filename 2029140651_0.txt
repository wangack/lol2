[0:08:08] MonsterInABoX: Would be interesting to see what you do for Prep even if you think it's boring . Assuming you're comfortable streaming it
[0:08:13] RSWReece: good morning medic, i hope you are well
[0:09:13] kimiduts: Hello
[0:09:20] MonsterInABoX: Oh shit yeah, lots of work for you to do on the season updates I guess !
[0:09:22] Aglan16: show us the hidden script for the LEC this year, surely the writers are preparing some rise like a phoenix come back for us Kappa
[0:10:19] iLoveShy28: Ehi morning Medic. hows it ?
[0:11:03] ellinore7: wish u a great day ahead mate
[0:11:04] 2percentwinrate: hihi
[0:11:06] Darkestofman: Wooo the rakan GOD, Here is to having a great game and a big W blobDance catJAM LICKA
[0:11:13] 2percentwinrate: that hoody looks crazy comfy
[0:12:33] 2percentwinrate: cho is gonna buy the new mr items and is not gonna take dmg
[0:13:50] Darkestofman: I love me some Nahnic rucin
[0:14:05] shinwinter: aloo medic
[0:14:20] shinwinter: right in time to save the day
[0:15:10] shinwinter: any thoughts on playing neeko sup ?
[0:15:40] Ninzel: peepoArrive
[0:15:53] Rodnelas: is ashe still good as support this patch?
[0:16:03] shinwinter: oh ok  i mean  i saw pedro suffer from her yesterday so it's kinda look fun
[0:16:24] Rodnelas: i havent had any problems but i hear people saying she is weak
[0:16:37] Rodnelas: while i think i am fine so i must be doing somethign wrong
[0:16:48] shinwinter: @Rodnelas i saw only adc now
[0:17:01] Veryuki: do you like rakans new skin? :3
[0:17:23] Rodnelas: ive had no tanks in my game so far lol
[0:17:44] Aglan16: From trying both out ADC Ashe feels bit better now than support
[0:17:47] shinwinter: @Rodnelas omg really ? so lucky
[0:18:03] Auroxanex_Pendragon: Is it better to use the new starting support item for trading or exercuting minions?
[0:18:13] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas yeah maybe 1 game but like we stomped bot lane that hard that it didnt matter
[0:19:06] fappse: is trading better then charing cannon?
[0:19:12] LlandriGaming: It gives you the flexibility of trading when you can but hittin minions when you cant. I like it overall except that you cant get any gold from it until 2m15
[0:19:15] shinwinter: i watch pedro adc games yesterday it's at least 2 tank in team LUL
[0:19:17] Rodnelas: hows the item on rakan that stacks up to a 100 and allies get sped up behind you , and your next auto slows thoughts?
[0:19:28] fappse: ohh I didnt know
[0:20:07] Darkestofman: yay second game Remake, im having fun catClap catClap Depredge Depredge
[0:21:08] osrskuzzy: why do almost all league streamers play in low-quality? @MedicCasts
[0:21:55] osrskuzzy: do u think kaisa will come back in the new season
[0:22:00] Forged__: @MedicCasts Is there a short term for gastro-enteritis in English since it's a pretty common disease? In French we just call it gastro
[0:22:18] osrskuzzy: varus is him
[0:22:46] Auroxanex_Pendragon: Do you think that there are too many changes made to this season?
[0:23:21] osrskuzzy: it will all be changed in the near future
[0:23:25] Aglan16: I still think it's silly that of all seasons this one did not have any pre-season
[0:23:29] osrskuzzy: cept the map
[0:24:02] 8610sleeping: @Aglan16 no i think thats perfect. makes it a more fun and new learning experience
[0:24:14] osrskuzzy: pro playa
[0:24:16] Rodnelas: XAYAHHHH
[0:24:25] Forged__: @Aglan16 it's mostly because they changed to the 2 splits system
[0:24:37] osrskuzzy: nvm
[0:24:37] HaggisMcSwaggis: I just wanted to say that your talking through of the game as you play has been very helpful coming from a relative newbie
[0:24:39] Aglan16: @Aglan16 I can see that view as well, I do have to say I didn't have this much fun with league in a while
[0:24:49] Wisepinguin: Just play adc and like nothing changed outside of the map
[0:25:01] Wisepinguin: Also good morning
[0:25:25] fappse: items are easaly rebalanced but with the map we have to play for a while
[0:25:25] osrskuzzy: i think they tried to make it less blue side dominant
[0:26:32] osrskuzzy: tell me kaisa is gunna build terminus
[0:26:34] shinwinter: yeah
[0:26:37] Rodnelas: yeah taht one
[0:26:54] Aglan16: sometimes I feel like last pick on red side is also not used as effectively as it could be
[0:27:05] shinwinter: red side botlane new map is  a warl zone now
[0:27:10] shinwinter: war*
[0:27:18] osrskuzzy: change is almost always good but takes time to get used to
[0:27:34] shinwinter: YEP
[0:27:51] Rodnelas: i really like the sleigh one on ashe
[0:28:14] shinwinter: g opet the kitty medic
[0:28:15] shinwinter: meow
[0:28:23] shinwinter: noo the kitty left ><
[0:28:36] shinwinter: LUL
[0:28:43] osrskuzzy: meow
[0:28:52] shinwinter: i mean rengar LUL
[0:29:01] osrskuzzy: danger meow
[0:30:04] fappse: this meow kitty is well fed
[0:30:26] osrskuzzy: @MedicCasts is the lec employing the same things as  lcs this season
[0:30:34] remixlol1: HeyGuys <3
[0:31:02] Guentherr: but lec is on 14.1 this weekend right?
[0:31:03] remixlol1: Ye a lil 10h stream
[0:31:06] Sir_Acheron: Hi Medic!
[0:31:23] Aglan16: I think not reading the chat is also smart because LEC chat will be full of rats xdd
[0:31:31] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[0:31:33] l0tus666: is it just me or the turrets glow purple?
[0:31:56] Aglan16: I think it's the void grubs effect
[0:31:59] remixlol1: They glow purple when you hit them while haveing voidcrubs
[0:32:01] remixlol1: grubs*
[0:32:01] irdi19: Thoughts on supp beijg the most brokej role in the game @mediccasts
[0:32:02] Rodnelas: when you get the passive from the rubgs it turns purple
[0:32:48] luffa__: ur up griding early mate
[0:32:53] Rodnelas: yes its the DOT effect
[0:32:57] Rodnelas: that glows purple
[0:33:08] cotran61: yoo sup medic and good morning
[0:33:09] luffa__: grinding* ffs
[0:33:31] BanjoCash: THoughts on having the most broken english in the chat?
[0:33:38] Ogritwatches: good morning
[0:33:47] Rodnelas: magic resist sunfire
[0:33:47] d3rimpacter: Im very happy that mages got some new items. Building the same 5 every game was getting a bit boring
[0:33:47] Forged__: Thoughts on having thoughts?
[0:33:52] osrskuzzy: does lec have an ambassador? kinda wierd for makrZ to make an announcement for that when i never heard of that (been playing since beta)
[0:34:41] osrskuzzy: mb wrong term
[0:34:50] MrShooot: sanest qiyana player
[0:35:08] d3rimpacter: how dare you have range
[0:35:11] Airfire: @osrskuzzy there has always been a commissioner of both leagues, they typically haven't been as vocal as Mark has been in his initial stint but I think that's one of the reasons riot wanted him
[0:35:22] tamlAa: are commisioners allowed to make arrests?
[0:35:31] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[0:35:36] osrskuzzy: @Airfire i agree
[0:35:40] Forged__: @osrskuzzy Also people are concerned the LCS is dying which is not the case for the LEC so they had to be vocal
[0:35:45] d3rimpacter: @MrShooot Last week an zed insulted me for playing a "pussy" champion like Viktor xdd
[0:36:01] Airfire: I completely agree medic
[0:36:06] osrskuzzy: whos ur favorite shout caster?
[0:36:12] Guentherr: lets make quickshot out lec commissioner
[0:36:20] dan_cherous: !song
[0:36:20] StreamElements: The song is shown on the bottom of the stream!
[0:36:21] HaggisMcSwaggis: yea VALORANT does that well too with Leo Faria
[0:36:24] shinwinter: LEC when
[0:37:11] MrShooot: karthus seems to like the gray gradient from death this game
[0:37:16] Aglan16: @shinwinter in two days
[0:37:24] Genewen: Moin Medic, enjoying the new patch?
[0:37:24] osrskuzzy: = transparent
[0:38:32] osrskuzzy: what time is it where u are @MedicCasts
[0:39:21] osrskuzzy: damn 6 hours ahead of me
[0:39:23] Forged__: Who would have thought that communication is healthy
[0:39:26] shinwinter: @Aglan16  srry i mean do things like markz of LCS
[0:39:33] Aglan16: ah xdd
[0:39:52] osrskuzzy: who the comish of lec again?
[0:39:58] Faylea: i loved the lcs video, lec could really benefit from something similar
[0:40:09] osrskuzzy: o.O
[0:40:12] shinwinter: oh by the way what happened to quickshot ? any news ?
[0:40:14] TheHappySocks: Artem Bykov
[0:40:49] osrskuzzy: i saw the uh talent for lec 2024 where quicshot??
[0:41:02] IcebergTiger: 1K xdd
[0:41:06] Rhinjob: same commissioner that presided over the death oh HoTS esports
[0:41:38] osrskuzzy: i figured quickshot would be comish by now
[0:42:11] osrskuzzy: indeed i agree
[0:42:24] osrskuzzy: riot and cs are the main things
[0:42:37] Airfire: listening to Brens podcast with Wyatt River about how some of the OWL stuff was handled was very interesting
[0:43:00] Airfire: well, Brens feature on Wyatt Rivers podcast
[0:43:20] Wisepinguin: what are kaisa's items this game?
[0:43:27] tamlAa: starcraft 2 was pretty good for a while but I guess it didnt make the big money
[0:43:30] Sasadal: Goodmorning chaterinos
[0:43:42] rinke_gaming: hey medic quick question from a trash low elo support main do you think its worth to sacrivise lane prio to early roam to grubs?
[0:43:49] Silfel: She's doing well for the situation
[0:44:04] osrskuzzy: @MedicCasts can you comment on the quickshot situation, sorry if u already did....i did not hear
[0:44:15] tamlAa: yeah a lot of passionate people doing the work
[0:44:17] Wisepinguin: Karthus lives
[0:44:18] BanjoCash: But then they put the streams behind a paywall
[0:44:27] osrskuzzy: OH NO
[0:44:30] Forged__: there is a quickshot situation?
[0:44:30] Ogritwatches: what happened chat?
[0:44:33] osrskuzzy: HAS HE BEEN FIRED
[0:44:34] Just_a_PixeI: What happened to Quickshot? :(
[0:44:42] Ogritwatches: oh no
[0:44:44] Dursti: Sadge
[0:44:46] Forged__: OH
[0:44:48] luffa__: the early overwatch esports before owl was really good and early owl was also pretty good tbf to blizzard
[0:44:52] Ogritwatches: quickshot Sadge
[0:45:02] osrskuzzy: GigaSadge
[0:45:02] pomnz: Hope he and his family are doing well
[0:45:02] HaggisMcSwaggis: was it StarCraft where the ‘p’ and ‘pp’ drama came from?
[0:45:18] lec_airport_speedrun: @mediccasts any comment on the medic situation
[0:45:23] itsvernbaby: quickshot no longer in lec?
[0:45:38] osrskuzzy: @itsvernbaby nope
[0:45:47] Silfel: 😌
[0:45:55] itsvernbaby: :( this brings great sadness
[0:45:56] lec_airport_speedrun: Ok, any comment on the wigius situation
[0:46:04] Airfire: I know that you have spoken on this a lot but I do appreciate that you're not content brained where you just respond to everything regardless of optics. just thought I'd share because hard to get positive feedback sometimes
[0:46:12] Bilalligator: Hellowo
[0:46:17] tamlAa: yes, but that where korean companies @HaggisMcSwaggis they didnt allow any typing besides gl hf pp and gg
[0:46:19] osrskuzzy: quickshot and sjokz and phreak are the ogz
[0:46:22] Bilalligator: how you liking the new skin?
[0:46:42] remixlol1: @Airfire Same, I really love that about Medic
[0:46:46] shinwinter: hmmmm Susge
[0:46:47] lec_airport_speedrun: Bro's been NDA'd, F
[0:46:49] Silfel: That's fair
[0:46:59] pomnz: Any comment on the LEC players head shaving situation?
[0:47:04] Wisepinguin: Just in now: Medic is a reasonable human being
[0:47:04] itsvernbaby: nah i think hes just respecting his friends privacy
[0:47:12] remixlol1: lil bro is british but says isnt it instead of innit? nah....
[0:47:26] Bilalligator: yeah prestige skins imo feel underwhelming because of the lack of voicelines or new animations, legendaries feel better
[0:47:34] ccosttello: team comp is so ap heavy
[0:47:38] LlandriGaming: what do you mean, he ultied when they were all at full health, surely that counts
[0:47:59] Finiito: Good day fellas, I hope your day will be as beautiful as person you see in the mirror. ^^
[0:48:10] Bilalligator: remix, how OP is varus/kaisa atm?
[0:48:12] Epsi_long: xdd
[0:48:17] lec_airport_speedrun: @osrskuzzy he obviously thinks he's 10x the caster flowers is but he's biased and wrong on the matter
[0:48:29] tamlAa: maybe the nice range coment was ment to point out your lack of frontline, giving draft advise
[0:48:29] Wisepinguin: Yeah respecting a friends privacy i think is just being a reasonable human being
[0:48:31] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:48:35] remixlol1: @Bilalligator I think Varus very strong still, Kaisa needs the right build which hasnt been found yet imo
[0:48:54] Bilalligator: have you tried manamune guinsoo nashors into AP?
[0:48:56] remixlol1: But jhin is fkn broken holy moly man
[0:48:57] Raur: Ironic that you're more flowery.
[0:48:57] sidequest76: You have a much more baritone voice than Flowers ezpz
[0:49:01] remixlol1: @Bilalligator Not yet
[0:49:02] Genewen: you're also cuter ;)
[0:49:04] shinwinter: YEP
[0:49:09] shinwinter: diffrenct style
[0:49:17] shinwinter: difference *
[0:49:17] pomnz: I think there's a similar but distinct difference between Flowers and Medic energy
[0:49:22] tamlAa: Impaaaccctt what are you dooing impaaact! probably my favorite caster line
[0:49:25] luffa__: ur very ap heavy, so easy for him to itemise
[0:49:30] sidequest76: Deeper tone of voice = better cast well known fact
[0:49:46] remixlol1: Abyssal Mask good item since ur team is very much ap @MedicCasts
[0:49:54] Forged__: "THAT TP SUCKED!", so calm and collected, so british
[0:49:55] Bilalligator: americans like flowers because small words easy understand
[0:49:55] lec_airport_speedrun: Medic loses to the LCK guys
[0:49:57] remixlol1: Think you´d still lose cuz Kaisa is bad but still
[0:50:01] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[0:50:08] pomnz: But I think Flowers is much more American in having a higher baseline energy, but that makes Medics peake more impactful
[0:50:08] Airfire: I think Kaisa also needed lord doms faster this game
[0:50:11] lec_airport_speedrun: Those guys are actual casters
[0:50:18] Forged__: @Bilalligator why use many words when few words do trick
[0:50:25] itsvernbaby: @MedicCasts how are you feeling about the new changes? what change do you think will take the longest to get used to?
[0:50:31] lec_airport_speedrun: Based
[0:50:54] remixlol1: Dw about losing btw, placements are scripted bro
[0:51:02] Titoss_Larhzal: caedrel is online Pog
[0:51:03] Aglan16: tanks monkaW
[0:51:03] remixlol1: I went 2-3 on both main and smurf no matter what I did
[0:51:11] l0tus666: tank btw
[0:51:14] l0tus666: :)
[0:51:22] Bilalligator: @remixlol1 skill issue tbh
[0:51:25] remixlol1: @MedicCasts did you see the video I posted yesterday on twitter? If not watch it... was my first game ending :D
[0:51:40] LUCYXZ1337: humanoid's screen showing shades of gray
[0:51:56] lec_airport_speedrun: Yo @remixlol1 where did you place in the end, tuned in towards the end and saw 3-3 on main
[0:51:58] MedicCasts: https://twitter.com/MoleculeLOL/status/1745370736590823666/photo/1
[0:52:01] Bilalligator: stormsurge is bonger broken
[0:52:04] remixlol1: Cyclosword, dirk, nashors, shadowflame is my current best guess for Kaisa
[0:52:11] remixlol1: But i´ll try it ty
[0:52:17] remixlol1: Remix_LoL afaik

[0:52:52] Silfel: "tilted" awaree
[0:52:56] remixlol1: I hard fought for this
[0:53:00] remixlol1: The moment of realisation tho...
[0:53:07] Bilalligator: bronze macro tbh
[0:53:17] LUCYXZ1337: bro that new lec song is banger
[0:53:21] TheAphadon: Just win 4Head
[0:53:21] remixlol1: My toplaner literally wrote in chat: dw I can hold him
[0:53:24] LUCYXZ1337: big tenacious D energy
[0:53:34] Bilalligator: silhouette
[0:53:36] LUCYXZ1337: siloiswet
[0:53:37] sidequest76: @remixlol1 I type that every game
[0:53:39] a920123_: That was the new animation buff right there LUL

[0:53:58] FrostSJ: any chance of duo-ing with the rat king himself since he's going to challenger with adc
[0:54:16] osrskuzzy: nami??
[0:54:28] FrostSJ: ah
[0:54:37] Titoss_Larhzal: @osrskuzzy does nami use ardent?
[0:54:37] osrskuzzy: his he gay chat?
[0:54:39] Epsi_long: rat mentioned THEXDDAPPEARS
[0:54:53] Airfire: I felt like you were absolutely unkillable last game btw I don't know if that was just a Rakan thing or if it's because of the new season
[0:54:55] remixlol1: My take after 17 games for support: Zeke´s broken FH broken Tanks broken ADC: Lethality all the way baby (jhin varus)
[0:55:01] osrskuzzy: evenutally yeah
[0:55:02] Titoss_Larhzal: @Epsi_long ddx

[0:56:02] Forged__: Wrong, shilouette is how Sean Connery pronounces silhouette

[0:56:53] Raur: assasin at the top

[0:59:25] remixlol1: Hubris biggest bait item, dont ever build it pls
[0:59:31] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[0:59:33] luffa__: it looks good, u look younger
[0:59:36] osrskuzzy: nah look up terminus for vaurs
[0:59:36] Roktaz: Serylda's is 20 +11% lethality armor pen I believe
[0:59:40] Epsi_long: xdd true
[0:59:57] Forged__: Medic did you just assume the average league player knows what Hubris mean?
[1:00:01] l0tus666: the statue it gives looks cool tho xdd
[1:00:02] osrskuzzy: bot?>?
[1:00:02] remixlol1: Terminus is never a first item
[1:00:08] osrskuzzy: nah
[1:00:11] remixlol1: Lets say Varus right, Blade, Jaksho, Terminus
[1:00:16] Rekarewof: Kraken>Terminus>Rageblade seemed super strong on Kai'sa
[1:00:18] DapSchaf: the recommended items are completely fucked now. I take forever in base to read items
[1:00:18] KiccDacc: Serylda’s Grudge is 20% + 11% Lethality Armour pen on a passive, just looked it up
[1:00:20] KiccDacc: Serylda’s Grudge is 20% + 11% Lethality Armour pen on a passive, just looked it up 󠀀
[1:00:27] DapSchaf: It reccomended Malignence on zilean support
[1:00:31] remixlol1: I think Terminus 3rd is very good on many champs
[1:00:36] remixlol1: Same for hexplate on noc or zeri
[1:00:48] Bilalligator: just wait for my lethality HoB sett top
[1:00:55] Raur: Pyke seems pretty strong with all the new lethality items
[1:00:57] Bilalligator: alowo
[1:01:02] lec_airport_speedrun: @dapschaf naturally, people still working the patch out as well as zilean supp being a less common pick
[1:01:02] Titoss_Larhzal: !rank
[1:01:03] LoLRankBot: Medic is Unranked
[1:01:05] remixlol1: Eclipse dead for bot atleast
[1:01:14] Cameronal1: It's recommending malignance on everyone, I'm getting it on Taliyah
[1:01:15] Titoss_Larhzal: !pastrank
[1:01:29] lec_airport_speedrun: ???
[1:01:31] StreamElements: Please sub, it costs a lot to have hair this good and a fashion sense.
[1:01:37] remixlol1: If you want we can sit together and I can give you any insights on new items before you cast @MedicCasts so your up to date?
[1:01:37] Epsi_long: HUH
[1:01:40] Jeremy_The_Bear: HHUH
[1:01:43] osrskuzzy: HUH
[1:01:43] alumentum123: HUH
[1:01:43] remixlol1: Atleast for bot
[1:01:44] RSWReece: ???
[1:01:45] Cameronal1: HUH
[1:01:46] l0tus666: HUH
[1:01:47] Ludique__: Technically if you're really hungry for the ultimate ability haste on Zil malignance would make 'sense' but its still troll lmao
[1:02:00] Epsi_long: nah bro time him out for a month
[1:02:03] Pezbhop: Do you feel prepared for LEC?
[1:02:04] Epsi_long: xdd
[1:02:05] remixlol1: Alright alright
[1:02:10] DapSchaf: @lec_airport_speedrun yeah i only played zilean by accident because quickplay confused me. I didn't know you pick your champ so soon
[1:02:13] osrskuzzy: xdd
[1:02:14] sjanti: ey yo I wanted to hear the story
[1:02:14] remixlol1: I´ll try to give you a text about it then after my stream today
[1:02:18] remixlol1: Include everything I can
[1:02:19] Koroshimashou: Cheers Medic, what do you think of enchanters vs engage on this patch?
[1:02:22] lec_airport_speedrun: That's your hint to go live
[1:02:26] lec_airport_speedrun: Btw
[1:02:47] remixlol1: It´ll probably come late today since I´ll prolly do another 6-10h session later on stream
[1:02:54] Wisepinguin: Looking forward to going to LEC again at the end of the month
[1:02:57] preddypred: Who do you think will do well this split? I think the Korean bot of Fnatic will show up
[1:02:58] osrskuzzy: full ap rakan
[1:03:00] Cythan_: Jamgie
[1:03:01] osrskuzzy: send it
[1:03:09] Wisepinguin: Excited for the new studio and such
[1:03:11] l0tus666: protobelt rakan seems fun
[1:03:14] Koroshimashou: What replaced radiant virtue?
[1:03:20] s4vemys0ul: Enchanters probably situational depending on ad aswell or No?
[1:03:31] osrskuzzy: jayce inc
[1:03:31] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[1:03:42] KiccDacc: Yep, the lethality bonus is an interesting choice
[1:03:59] praharshallada: learning on the job  this time I guess
[1:04:03] LlandriGaming: @MedicCasts did you catch the LCK stream on patch day?
[1:04:05] im_Pepz: Hey medic, any plans on entering the trackmania scene again?
[1:04:11] im_Pepz: I really enjoyed that :P
[1:04:11] Just_a_PixeI: You'd think Riot would provide you with some additional resources to look into ahead of time
[1:04:15] lec_airport_speedrun: What are your thoughts on nightshare disasterclass
[1:04:24] osrskuzzy: the  company doesnt respect employees imagine
[1:05:00] Just_a_PixeI: Yeah that's totally fair! It's just rough to have such a short time to prep now haha
[1:05:00] FrostSJ: @remixlol1 how about terminus 3rd item for lethality lucian? volt, reaver, terminus
[1:05:18] DapSchaf: am i just missing it or did they remove the percentage when you execute a minion?
[1:05:25] DapSchaf: it still executes i just can't find when
[1:05:26] Ludique__: LCS is gonna have this problem forever now because of playing on Live
[1:05:36] osrskuzzy: as soon as u start going in an hopping back
[1:05:50] remixlol1: Not the biggest fan of it on Lucian @FrostSJ but I could be wrong.
[1:06:02] lec_airport_speedrun: No you're not wrong
[1:06:12] lec_airport_speedrun: Never have been, never will be etc etc
[1:06:31] osrskuzzy: when varus gets 3 items
[1:06:32] flappz: Do you lose money if the support takes the cannon? Because it shows 20 g if u take it
[1:06:36] osrskuzzy: lmao
[1:07:07] FrostSJ: @remixlol1 gotta test it out i guess
[1:07:10] Ludique__: Ah so no reason to save it for cannon now unless really niche pushing cases?
[1:07:20] remixlol1: Yeah for sure @FrostSJ
[1:07:26] Lodgeyx: does the support item keep its gp10 throughout
[1:07:26] DapSchaf: yep Ludique__
[1:07:29] lec_airport_speedrun: Feel like you're still incentivised to execute ranged minions because it's just giving you more gold than normal
[1:07:37] remixlol1: Moving early for the grubs is worth it if your support doesnt lose too much for it @MedicCasts
[1:07:50] remixlol1: But if you see they dont contest you let jgl solo it and walk back bot
[1:08:41] harisdmech: k'sante lost his mind
[1:08:48] osrskuzzy: do u know what happened to riv @MedicCasts
[1:09:06] remixlol1: Absolute good move there, enemys didnt even punish varus thats huge
[1:09:19] osrskuzzy: i think he is
[1:09:21] Forged__: @osrskuzzy riven? river? rinvington the 3rd?
[1:09:29] Airfire: I know he works on motorbikes a lot now
[1:09:31] osrskuzzy: riv111
[1:09:44] RlyBadPlyer: how's season 14 been Mr. Medic
[1:09:45] remixlol1: Gigachad varus freezes any ammount of minions lmao
[1:09:58] FrostSJ: lmao
[1:10:20] remixlol1: I can see that point, never really thought about it tbh
[1:10:36] DapSchaf: are towers further back? or is the wall just different?
[1:10:41] remixlol1: But if you have time to ward enemy tri its better than both no?
[1:10:46] DapSchaf: maybe the visuals just confuse me
[1:10:48] Forged__: but the ward isnt in the bush so it triggers my ocd
[1:11:02] RlyBadPlyer: damn
[1:11:45] tomepajkovski: From my experience, support leaving kills can cause  multiple deaths and missed kills.   What is your thought process on leaving kills?
[1:11:49] osrskuzzy: how much do you think america has affected the rest of the world
[1:11:49] Squallly: g'morning Medic, g'morning chat medicHeart
[1:11:50] mynci: In our game yesterday the banner next to mid tier 1 tower was hanging between tower and the wall gap
[1:11:54] Tebrevet: what's that rakan skin? looks very cool
[1:11:58] FrostSJ: morning
[1:12:01] LlandriGaming: I actually thought they had made the whole map bigger, the new sections feel huge compaired to what they replaced, it's not until you run around the other areas you realise it's the same size as always
[1:12:06] LordAnomandaris: When does the new LEC season start up again?
[1:12:06] RlyBadPlyer: @Tebrevet dragonmancer I think
[1:12:09] mynci: Like they changed the map but not the code for the banners
[1:12:12] Squallly: !lec
[1:12:12] StreamElements: LEC (and Medic) returns on January 13!
[1:12:12] Pezbhop: why cant you see the kda / cs and time?
[1:12:25] Ludique__: How much do you think Noxus has affected the rest of Runeterra??
[1:12:29] LordAnomandaris: @Squallly thx
[1:12:35] Pezbhop: my stream wasn't on fullscreen i am dumb
[1:12:38] FrostSJ: is lec the first League that comes back with the new season?
[1:12:39] HeckMayster: grande padre rakan skin so pretty

[1:12:57] Darkexcal: How are you finding the new patch?
[1:13:07] Pezbhop: thought it was a new setting lol
[1:13:14] lec_airport_speedrun: @frostsj technically LCK was first with their season kickoff event
[1:13:40] di3ic3: caedrel q
[1:13:43] FrostSJ: yeah but that isnt a event that mattered its just for fun

[1:13:53] jaggler: also hewwo Mr Medic
[1:14:03] Squallly: heya @jaggler!
[1:14:05] Sasadal: What do the voidgrubs do? i find patch notes quite vague about it
[1:14:08] mynci: Had a syndra pop me in 2.87 seconds yesterday on illaoi
[1:14:11] osrskuzzy: shit lg
[1:14:16] jaggler: Hello mr. Squally!
[1:14:27] mynci: I had 5k health KEKW
[1:14:43] Darkexcal: Yeah item figuring out is my main aim ATM too especially the support item
[1:14:56] remixlol1: Decent item on graves, makes his 1st hit, hit hard
[1:15:00] RlyBadPlyer: I'm pretty much just grabbing Staff on everyone
[1:15:07] Forged__: Dont go to the dark side Medic
[1:15:11] RlyBadPlyer: Staff of Flowing Water
[1:15:14] osrskuzzy: nami/lucian coming back
[1:15:15] Raur: Try Pyke. He seems pretty strong with opportunity/cyclosword
[1:15:22] remixlol1: Its not blade
[1:15:24] HeckMayster: nope blade buildpath is same
[1:15:26] Hawksdrool: could be terminus
[1:15:27] ubtcoinflip: Ayyyy good morning, is that the new rakan skin im seeing?
[1:15:34] mynci: Storm surge is annoying af, played into a no adc team yesterday just 3 tanks syndra and karthus
[1:15:37] remixlol1: Tell him to not go hexplate first, its rly not good :D
[1:15:39] HeckMayster: kraken is really good
[1:15:49] jaggler: Stormsurge do be stronk
[1:15:55] ubtcoinflip: Proto over Trailblazer?
[1:16:01] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[1:16:01] Hoang_X: !song
[1:16:02] StreamElements: The song is shown on the bottom of the stream!
[1:16:09] remixlol1: Im here for the full ap rakan
[1:16:13] hayleeejay: I played 10 games before realising the support item gets a final upgrade 😬
[1:16:22] cdrs: tank 2 turret shots so cannon lives longer, 200iq
[1:16:30] Koroshimashou: Proto gives you the extra dash for knock up I guess
[1:16:44] Hoang_X: i heard a lot of ppl have been going ap rakan, any reasons?
[1:16:51] mynci: Im liking sundered sky on bruisers
[1:16:58] RlyBadPlyer: @Hoang_X his AP ratios are ridonkulous
[1:17:07] ubtcoinflip: I also heard good things about proto
[1:17:31] ubtcoinflip: Against poke comps you cant go for it sadly, but in 5v5 comps its good
[1:17:37] POweeeeee: Morello should be a viable support item too now right? It's so cheap
[1:17:56] osrskuzzy: ez
[1:18:21] mynci: Is morello still an item?
[1:18:31] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:18:46] 18osj: Permanent?
[1:19:11] Draqeo: i dont like the cinders, if i wanted to play Bard i'd play bard
[1:19:56] jaggler: any elpers?
[1:20:37] RSWReece: i saw a tweet saying its rocketbelt into crown
[1:20:37] ubtcoinflip: ZEKES IS SOOOO AMAZING I LOVE THAT THEY BROUGHT BACK THE OLD EFFECT
[1:20:38] jaggler: why do you run away and not just give kassa a doublekill?
[1:20:39] jaggler: rude
[1:20:44] Ogritwatches: wait is that a protobelt?
[1:20:45] ubtcoinflip: But trailblazer is so good tho
[1:20:48] Ogritwatches: on a support
[1:20:56] Dursti: playing with such adcs as support is the most frustrating thing in league
[1:21:34] ubtcoinflip: im so in love with the new season
[1:21:41] ubtcoinflip: you can also play so many mage supps again
[1:21:48] ubtcoinflip: anivia supp or even syndra supp are broken
[1:22:05] Ogritwatches: as an enchanter support I hate that
[1:22:08] Ogritwatches: lol
[1:22:10] jaggler: yesterday in ARAM a Sylas complained that Rito nerfed Mages so hard that they are useless Sadge
[1:22:30] ubtcoinflip: Also full ap gragas support is busted trust me on this
[1:22:34] Auroxanex_Pendragon: I need this Rakan skin
[1:22:43] killerwa1rus: how're you finding the rocketbelt tech?
[1:22:54] tamlAa: hey now he was a 700g shut down all acording to plan
[1:22:59] justkaleathings: they're crazy, those Swedes
[1:23:06] jaggler: i am sad that kindred get's a prestige and its porcelain Sadge
[1:23:10] Jeremy_The_Bear: what are them lil flames on the map you pick up?
[1:23:31] jaggler: @Jeremy_The_Bear infernal rift, they give Ability haste
[1:23:36] mynci: Bot lanes in my games have just had any mage with a stun in support
[1:23:40] Jeremy_The_Bear: Ah. Thanks @jaggler
[1:23:46] slackermethod: Some nice W damage though
[1:23:48] POweeeeee: That ap scaling coming in clutch there
[1:23:53] Dursti: eu kassadin ptsd
[1:24:13] jaggler: AP Rakan was fun in ARAM, but i think they nerfed the AP ratios a while ago
[1:25:17] Jeremy_The_Bear: varus wasting no time flaming after dying
[1:25:25] tamlAa: wait the have a fiddlesticks? what a suprise KappaClaus
[1:25:30] shadowcieth_lol: Varus has an awful lot to say
[1:25:50] Bilalligator: ADC items are nerfed now i think so its also harder to kill a tank
[1:25:55] grmvincible: !title
[1:26:29] Alandus: hey Medic, how does rRakan feel with the item rework? I am kinda scared to jump into rankeds
[1:26:50] DapSchaf: hitting ranged people?
[1:26:57] Bilalligator: grab everyone in a cone?
[1:27:01] StreamElements: Want to stay up to date with all things Team BDS? You can find all their socials over here: https://linktr.ee/TeamBDS medicNoted
[1:27:14] POweeeeee: How are the new supp items @mediccasts ?
[1:27:24] POweeeeee: First impressions
[1:27:48] Challenjord: seigh > trailblazer is op on rakan my lad
[1:27:50] POweeeeee: I see
[1:28:06] vanhoudt_victor: thoughts on battle song into zeke and frozen ?
[1:28:24] Ludique__: global blue buff definitely a late game objective worth dying for
[1:28:53] Bilalligator: twas a dick measuring contest
[1:28:58] grmvincible: (i'm gonna risk being the 100th chatter to point this out, but the moose-crash-test does not involve a moose. It is a hard swerving manovre at speed designed to simulate avoiding crashing into a moose that ran into the street. It was famously failed by the Mercedes A-Class which tipped over during the test.)
[1:29:31] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[1:30:10] ElusiveFRZ: hi medic, chat
[1:30:20] Squallly: @ElusiveFRZ medicHi
[1:30:37] ElusiveFRZ: is this the new rakan skin?
[1:30:38] cHiLmAxzU: varus really taking ownership of his mistakes
[1:31:02] ElusiveFRZ: i wonder why there is no xayah skin to go with :(
[1:31:28] ElusiveFRZ: bummer, I liked the idea/concept of the joint skin
[1:31:31] StreamElements: Oh yes, please give me subby wubbies, feels yummy in my tummy.
[1:31:44] Pezbhop: i think varus needs therapy
[1:31:50] mynci: Runes? Theres a new one isnt there
[1:31:50] Vepziidoo: Good morning
[1:31:52] CoachChaoZ: rocketbelt feels like such a bait build unless enemies have really low dmg so your q healing can shine multiple times
[1:31:54] jameswlms: @StreamElements what an unfortunate day to have eyes
[1:32:01] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[1:32:27] Hoang_X: pedro ingame but not streaming gg
[1:32:35] j0hn_w3st: xdd farming losses
[1:32:50] KaiMarek: hi medic,  what are your first thoughts in the new season ? @MedicCasts
[1:32:57] CoachChaoZ: Yeah it's really bm XD
[1:33:06] Forged__: but, but, but, what about the Big Pace?
[1:33:14] firsttimechatterman: I dont blame Caedrel for not streaming, his chat is just really bad
[1:33:14] Isak_Solberg: top of the morning, Medic
[1:33:29] Hoang_X: my bad, i didnt see his tweet
[1:33:33] Airfire: yeah this is the right site
[1:33:37] remixlol1: Ok i was gone for 20mins, did I miss something chat?
[1:33:45] Forged__: it's never Big enough Medic
[1:33:46] Rodacon: He'll be streming even more when the season starts too
[1:33:46] PierceDev: PierceDev subscribed with Prime. 
[1:33:59] Forged__: @Rodacon the season did start
[1:34:00] CoachChaoZ: hey Remix no it's all chill :)
[1:34:11] Ixdex1: a chat like his is bound to wear a guy out
[1:34:12] Rodacon: @Forged__ I meant pro, should have specified.
[1:34:19] firsttimechatterman: @Ixdex1 true
[1:34:21] grmvincible: Walk into a restaurant and complain that the fastfood chain next door is closed.
[1:34:28] remixlol1: Dont worry Medic, I´d choose you over anyone <3
[1:34:28] mynci: Medics chat is far superior to caedrels chat tbh
[1:34:35] Silfel: Already monkaS
[1:34:44] IcebergTiger: @mynci xdd
[1:34:46] Ixdex1: @grmvincible McPedro?
[1:34:50] Scarf1991: it's an etiquette thing
[1:35:18] narraktig: @ElusiveFRZ this rakan skin is meant to be joint with brave phoenix xayah!
[1:35:24] Ageostrophy: I'm glad Medic is live
[1:35:28] remixlol1: Lowkey Jhin supp angle
[1:35:28] Rodnelas: ashe support lets gooooo
[1:35:31] remixlol1: if you look at ur team
[1:35:31] razlol: sry, its definitely from when I asked where excoundrel was and I'd rather watch a proper brit
[1:35:34] CoachChaoZ: Bloodsong Ashe lets goo
[1:35:37] ubtcoinflip: Enough Rakan????? As if there ever was such a thing
[1:35:39] kajo100032: I feel like adc champs are weaker this patch or is it just me ?
[1:35:39] Ludique__: heard there are some crazy variety in the ashe support builds right now
[1:35:47] Airfire: if you're taking requests a naut game would be interesting, I feel like he would be unkillable. Obviously your games so play who you want
[1:35:50] BedBound: What's up with normal/aram q time? I keep having 1+ hr queues
[1:35:53] the_great_pine: well this morning i just wanted to watch support gameplay and chill, luckily you were live <3
[1:35:53] Silfel: But what if more Rakan Sadge
[1:35:53] mynci: I really like that medic does early streams, thank you medic
[1:36:06] remixlol1: @kajo100032 Crit yes, lethality got stronger so varus jhin etc stronger
[1:36:09] mynci: Some of us are early birds
[1:36:14] sim4ecav2: Idk I'm part of both chats and I see no issue with it. I like watching Medic play support and like to watch Caedrel playing and reacting to the game in general
[1:36:14] ubtcoinflip: Honestly, im not sure whether you're a gragas enjoyer or not, but you should try him supp man
[1:36:16] Sunshade0: and still he feels he's not doing enough
[1:36:18] shinwinter: xdd
[1:36:26] j0hn_w3st: Awake and not streaming KEKWMad
[1:36:28] Rodacon: That's more  hours than a full time job anyway
[1:36:34] Isak_Solberg: 45 hours with his twitch chat is horrifying
[1:36:42] ubtcoinflip: Never Kenough Sadge
[1:36:47] Sunshade0: I don't envy streamers :(
[1:37:03] bigAL935: barrier vs heal here ?
[1:37:10] sjanti: In most of those months it wasnt even his only job lol
[1:37:11] Forged__: It's not about how long it is? tink
[1:37:12] remixlol1: Barrier better
[1:37:14] remixlol1: Vayne should go heal
[1:37:14] mynci: ARAMs are fun especially as a 5 stack
[1:37:25] pode17: now that Caedrel is out of the picture? Is there a chance you will take his place in the Euphoria podcasts?
[1:37:26] remixlol1: Cuz shes an adc
[1:37:31] Isak_Solberg: no approach velocity on sup ashe?
[1:37:32] remixlol1: all adcs are ... well :)
[1:37:34] shadowcieth_lol: You also have to take into account that streaming isn't only the time you are love. You also have prep time etc. so those 45 hrs are probably more like 50+
[1:37:38] Ogritwatches: you are also a caster caedrel is not
[1:37:41] Forged__: dagda
[1:37:44] Forged__: it's out already
[1:37:45] shadowcieth_lol: Live*
[1:37:58] Ogritwatches: no need to stream as much
[1:38:12] StaringEemil: medivedi episode of EUphoria was something
[1:38:20] ubtcoinflip: Maaan i hate when i ask a question or put something in chat and get an adbreak right after
[1:38:24] remixlol1: People forget about the prep before and after stream
[1:38:27] remixlol1: Very fast
[1:38:31] Airfire: by the way Medic I hear a lot of AJR on this sttream so I just wanted to say that if you like them you should have a listen to Jon Bellions album 'The Human Condition' - they're very closely linked
[1:38:34] ElusiveFRZ: you could be doing music videos with Vedi :)
[1:38:39] mynci: Im looking forward to Saturday to see which caster forgets the most new item names
[1:38:46] Evergetic: Evergetic subscribed with Prime. 
[1:38:52] shinwinter: but he's an ex pros and a league addicted and mostly it';s  LCK LPL games and soloq
[1:38:52] ubtcoinflip: Ohh just suggesting ap gragas supp tbh
[1:38:59] Odyssey1989: can we talk about that vile ornn skin?
[1:38:59] ubtcoinflip: ayyy @remixlol1 how are you my man
[1:39:02] remixlol1: Medic do you know when you go to bed today?
[1:39:10] MayonSiqueira: @Forged__ is Euphoria out? not finding it on youtube
[1:39:12] remixlol1: so I can send you the text before you can read some of it in bed I guess?
[1:39:12] Odyssey1989: Personal opinion and all that but man
[1:39:13] Airfire: gragas is BUSTED on this patch
[1:39:17] remixlol1: @ubtcoinflip Fantastic man what about you?
[1:39:26] fizzlewi: @mediccasts hi Medi do you play any MTG or other card games ?

[1:40:06] remixlol1: @dia_chaoz I will dont worry
[1:40:19] ubtcoinflip: @remixlol1 You too, be aware my aim is to end the day higher than u are
[1:40:25] Rodnelas: i saw your cardmarket game was pretty funny tbh
[1:40:37] remixlol1: @ubtcoinflip Race me
[1:41:12] bigAL935: this ezreal just has ur mouse click
[1:41:15] ElusiveFRZ: You should do D&D stream once/week *nods*
[1:41:16] Hoang_X: this ashe skin looks so good
[1:41:56] ElusiveFRZ: nonono I can be the DM you just play
[1:42:01] jaggler: you would also have to design and create a fitting outfit
[1:42:01] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[1:42:03] MayonSiqueira: D&D on its own is SO much time, I can't imagine streaming it
[1:42:12] fizzlewi: @mediccasts what's your fav colour combo / Commander?
[1:42:12] DapSchaf: dnd scheduling Aware
[1:42:29] ElusiveFRZ: exhausting but totally fun
[1:42:39] Rodnelas: @DapSchaf i know how it feels
[1:42:43] Tebrevet: My DM used about 5 hours of prep for his own homebrew campaign before each session, it really takes commitment
[1:42:50] HeadcrabGribble: Just take MollyMae's advice bro, there's 24 hours in a day!! (this is a joke btw lol)
[1:43:04] mynci: Reading is the best
[1:43:11] ElusiveFRZ: @Tebrevet yeah I run my own homebrew campaign as well, it is a lot of prep work
[1:43:12] LUCYXZ1337: you can read?
[1:43:15] LUCYXZ1337: jesus flex much
[1:43:21] smithsmithBE: @mediccasts I'm glad you're streaming because I don't come across a lot of support streamers anymore
[1:43:31] ElusiveFRZ: as a DM. As a player you just rock up.
[1:43:48] bigAL935: atleast he didnt tax the other wave as well KEKW
[1:43:48] Airfire: Bizzleberry
[1:43:56] smithsmithBE: Thanks for the tip
[1:43:58] QuaGiggityMire: Sorry can u repeat the name?
[1:44:04] Auroxanex_Pendragon: well def look it up thanks medic
[1:44:34] Draqeo: aren't all support streamers positive because they always get stuck with horrible ADCs?
[1:44:35] CoachChaoZ: nocturne is so strong on the new patch it's absurd
[1:44:55] Airfire: also HuzzyGames I think mostly queues top/support so you could look at his youtube content for similar stuff also, he's also very explain heavy I feel
[1:45:00] Rodnelas: Rodnelas subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:45:04] shadowcieth_lol: How do you feel about the new 5 haste item? Like having a cheap AH component?
[1:45:05] Squallly: @Draqeo medic's positive because he's old and he's passed the angsty gamer phase.  (mostly :p)
[1:45:07] remixlol1: @dia_chaoz was about time after he was weak on the old patch Kappa
[1:45:13] Wigglyhunter: eyo Doodie
[1:45:16] CoachChaoZ: xd
[1:45:24] Silfel: They want you so bad KEKWiggle
[1:45:24] Wigglyhunter: Not enough of people listen to her
[1:45:35] remixlol1: Yooo Rodnelas welcome to the stream, hope you´re having a great time here!
[1:45:50] Draqeo: @Draqeo medic is like 10 years younger than me LUL
[1:45:59] Rodnelas: You are welcome, i liek just how chill you are on stream and the discussions or things we talk about you are always calm and listen to the other person
[1:46:05] Rodnelas: @remixlol1 thank you thakn you
[1:46:21] CoachChaoZ: yep AH is rare
[1:46:23] Hoang_X: why swifties and not lucidity?
[1:46:29] CertainlySomeoneHere: I just noticed a bug with Terminus as well, it doesn't proc on anything but champions despite that not being in the description of the item at all
[1:46:32] jaggler: because fast
[1:46:41] remixlol1: I think the item is bait ngl
[1:46:52] remixlol1: Atleast early game I´d prefer refillable+pink
[1:47:06] Darkexcal: I'm glad the support item gives you more ways to earn gold now than being siloed to minions or hitting champs
[1:47:06] remixlol1: Yo the Vayne flash PogChamp
[1:47:20] ubtcoinflip: @remixlol1  i will
[1:47:27] jaggler: @CertainlySomeoneHere are ypou sure? Juxtapositions says "damaging attacks against champions" at least on the wiki
[1:47:54] CertainlySomeoneHere: @jaggler Item description in-game doesn't mention champions at all
[1:47:58] DapSchaf: worm tongue medic activates
[1:48:17] iLoveShy28: ezreal no cleanse vs this team comp ?
[1:48:19] CoachChaoZ: ingame descriptions are not good anyway
[1:48:21] CertainlySomeoneHere: just says 'alternate between light and dark on-hits each attack ' which is very misleading then tbh
[1:48:24] Cinnamen: Good morning
[1:48:31] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:48:34] Squallly: @Cinnamen Hey Cinnamen!
[1:48:42] Cinnamen: peepoWave
[1:49:23] bigAL935: u only have 1 void xdd so its not too much damage
[1:49:44] ertyerd: !elo
[1:49:45] LoLRankBot: Medic is Unranked
[1:49:53] bigAL935: woops, i only thought u had 1
[1:50:39] remixlol1: Ashe supp is strong because of the lane pressure aswell as early game vision with E
[1:50:45] remixlol1: Low ult cdr is just a nice bonus
[1:50:46] Rodnelas: i guess it is a little worse but stil verry playable from what i felt
[1:50:49] DrBiscotti: i can't figure out which support is best now
[1:51:00] CoachChaoZ: it's still really good on blueside, on redside it feels a bit meh cuz u cant shift for grubbs
[1:51:33] Rodnelas: i use the sleigh one on ashe
[1:51:36] CoachChaoZ: bloodsng
[1:51:37] capooka: bloodsong
[1:51:37] Cinnamen: Bloodsong of Sleigh
[1:51:38] Rodnelas: casue movespeed and heal
[1:51:46] Airfire: I think bloodsong
[1:51:54] Gabrielsen: Is it less ability haste in the game in general? Did a pyke game and i had such long cds.
[1:52:07] Rodnelas: but i think the two options are indeed bloodsong or the sleigh
[1:52:35] remixlol1: game is overloaded with dmg again
[1:52:41] Sjobbe: Hello
[1:52:43] remixlol1: need durability patch 2.0
[1:52:46] QuaGiggityMire: if you accidentally chose the wrong upgrade on the new support item is there any way undo that?
[1:52:48] Darkexcal: Yeah  feels burst champs with low cooldowns are the go to atm
[1:52:50] Rodnelas: @remixlol1 like every preseason no
[1:52:53] CoachChaoZ: ever so slightly xD @remixlol1
[1:53:02] remixlol1: @Rodnelas Its not preseason mate :D
[1:53:04] remixlol1: Thats the point
[1:53:07] Gabrielsen: id rather have overloaded dmg with long cds, than perma spamming abilites. Now abilites matter way more at least.
[1:53:10] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas ahn yes true forgot
[1:53:16] firsttimechatterman: Vedi <3
[1:53:18] Rodnelas: just so used to having preseason
[1:53:22] ArionZilver: Whats your current rank medic?
[1:53:29] remixlol1: @ArionZilver plat
[1:53:42] Squallly: @Sjobbe Hey @Sjobbe!  Hope you're feeling better! ^^
[1:53:43] AAAleksi: Carrying vedi Pog
[1:53:45] CoachChaoZ: @MedicCasts Are you excited to see AD leblanc again xdd
[1:54:04] Sjobbe: hey @Squallly a bit, chest is very sore
[1:54:09] Rodnelas: figuring out what whei does rip
[1:54:23] Rodnelas: i still go mandate
[1:54:31] Rodnelas: but i jsut dont know for sure if its the good choice
[1:54:35] jaggler: who's hewi and what does vedi want to do to him D:
[1:54:38] j0hn_w3st: any of the LCS changes you think LEC will try out
[1:54:39] Squallly: @Sjobbe pleased to hear you're heading in the right direction - hope you're back to fighting fit soon!
[1:54:41] remixlol1: its still mandate if you need dmg, redemption or bc work too
[1:54:43] DrBiscotti: could moonstone with sleigh be an option?
[1:54:49] luffa__: shes against gojo cut her some slack
[1:55:19] Th3Juggl3r: echo is dead, @MedicCasts
[1:55:28] Rodnelas: ive gone 2nd mandate and third liandries, but i prolly shoudlnt do liandry anymore and do axiom instead thoughts?
[1:55:32] iLoveShy28: @luffa__ ye thats why mid is open
[1:56:15] remixlol1: Redemption over liandrys, you dont need dmg imo
[1:56:42] Rodnelas: @remixlol1 i just feel (i am like low elo and bad at the game) like i dont know when to use it
[1:56:44] CoachChaoZ: Umbral Mandate Redemption sounds so troll
[1:56:55] DrBiscotti: chat, what about moonstone if you get sleigh, or the cd/heal is too weak?
[1:57:00] remixlol1: @Rodnelas Its mostly just think what ur team needs from you
[1:57:01] StreamElements: Want to stay up to date with all things Team BDS? You can find all their socials over here: https://linktr.ee/TeamBDS medicNoted
[1:57:08] CoachChaoZ: Riftmaker is not good it really isn't
[1:57:20] DenFedeKonge: First time i've not seen a smile on your face, thx for alot of good casting these last years, in my eyes you're the best caster, right after Quickshot. :P gl with new season
[1:57:25] remixlol1: The dmg from liandrys wont help but the redemption on top of ur team in fights will make a difference
[1:57:27] remixlol1: Can*
[1:57:34] Darkexcal: Orianna felt good but yeah stormsurge feels like it's a huge spike
[1:57:43] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas so if they would need more healing or smh i go redmption otherwies liandries or should i already go axiom
[1:58:07] vizaco_72: wait, a crash test moose?
[1:58:34] ElusiveFRZ: Since finals are in London, are you going to try hard to get in on the cast team for finals this year?
[1:58:37] Gabrielsen: damn i got the same bottle, use it when i go bouldering
[1:58:47] jaggler: i am sure he always tries hard KEKW
[1:58:50] macantor13: How're you enjoying the new season? Playing tanks feels very good
[1:58:51] sukh_m4n: What elo is this
[1:58:52] LoLRankBot: Medic is Unranked
[1:59:01] remixlol1: @Rodnelas Black cleaver over both liandrys and axiom normally, but not this game because he has little ad in team
[1:59:08] Darkexcal: Yeah think it's the next that respawns
[1:59:20] Darkexcal: Could be wrong with that though
[1:59:24] remixlol1: Buffs + Scuttle have to "respawn" to be infected by nashors void @MedicCasts
[1:59:26] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas i see thank you, new to ashe support
[1:59:31] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts

[1:59:56] IcebergTiger: What elo is this?
[1:59:57] LoLRankBot: Medic is Unranked
[2:00:01] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[2:00:07] Ludique__: Had a lot of success so far on Full AP TF too
[2:00:09] remixlol1: Buffs + Scuttle have to "respawn" to be infected by nashors void @MedicCasts
[2:00:29] remixlol1: After they got infected scuttle gives vision around if you kill it, and buffs get transfered to every teammate
[2:00:37] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas hoping i can get out of iron this time, but leveling a new account to play with friends on other server atm and ill do ranked there so lets pray i get out of iron to at least godl this year
[2:00:49] IcebergTiger: !rank
[2:00:52] LoLRankBot: Medic is Unranked  | Altaccount is Unranked
[2:01:28] Gabrielsen: Ez holding his e for season 15

[2:01:54] remixlol1: @StreamElements biggest scam every lmao
[2:02:23] Rodnelas: yeah i feel scammed now that i see that
[2:02:26] Scarf1991: he didn't specify it would be in game Kappa
[2:02:32] CoachChaoZ: lmao
[2:02:32] thelegitluke_1998: he had no smite
[2:02:34] IcebergTiger: 💀

[2:03:35] Annibal: SNIPED
[2:03:56] remixlol1: @dia_chaoz really good change imo
[2:04:03] KiccDacc: He tried you
[2:04:05] yoyolc: well he tried you
[2:04:11] Ixdex1: feels like everyone is playing on preseason brain, even with no preseason
[2:04:11] nineinperiodd: Lmeow
[2:04:17] Scarf1991: tried and succeeded
[2:04:23] CoachChaoZ: XD
[2:04:27] yoyolc: learning experience
[2:04:28] Draqeo: huh
[2:04:28] KiccDacc: Every day is a school day
[2:04:30] Genewen: a gentleman and a scholar!
[2:04:31] Annibal: @Ixdex1 To be fair people had only 2 days to practice this, so it truly is preseason
[2:04:31] imKennart: NOTED
[2:04:32] cHiLmAxzU: :)
[2:04:33] Krepo: but you can still insult his mother
[2:04:34] Silfel: Shocking result danNotes
[2:04:34] killerwa1rus: good to know
[2:04:35] macantor13: You 100% win with ult, should try it again
[2:04:35] Krepo: and that's priceless
[2:04:40] cHiLmAxzU: you died so we dont have to
[2:04:42] mynci: youll know that when you cast LEC now *nods*
[2:04:44] yoyolc: lmao Krepo
[2:04:58] CoachChaoZ: redemption no
[2:05:00] Ixdex1: @Annibal yeah, but not according to the ladder :p
[2:05:01] imKennart: Long swords
[2:05:01] BanjoCash: Pre season testing modCheck
[2:05:02] remixlol1: mandate
[2:05:09] remixlol1: redempt*
[2:05:13] Gabrielsen: you still coach @Krepo ?
[2:05:14] remixlol1: WAIT RELAX WOW
[2:05:14] mynci: wits end is always good
[2:05:16] Shield__Bog: i learned being a school teacher and to hate kids is not the wombo combo either
[2:05:18] CoachChaoZ: XDDDD
[2:05:18] luffa__: its chempunk normally i swear?
[2:05:19] Borellun: armor pen item, that gives slow?
[2:05:19] remixlol1: IT WAS A MISTAKE CALM DOWN WHAT
[2:05:20] Romeorules: assassin items with cdr
[2:05:24] captainfour222: Madge
[2:05:26] smellytwitchchatuser: xdd
[2:05:51] Borellun: serylda grudge
[2:05:56] Krepo: @Gabrielsen no
[2:06:02] CoachChaoZ: serylda is ass
[2:06:06] remixlol1: Grudge is bad
[2:06:10] remixlol1: if you dont have 2-3 letha items
[2:06:27] Rodnelas: @remixlol1 thoughts on senna support atm?
[2:06:29] remixlol1: U can go antiheal into redemption
[2:06:37] remixlol1: @Rodnelas fasting good, carry bad
[2:06:46] Borellun: what about the pink warding item?
[2:06:46] mynci: serpents fang? loadsa shields about and its cheap
[2:07:07] remixlol1: Antiheal 800g into redempt
[2:07:36] SlothyyCSGO: bruh an ad break right as they're at the nexus? Are you serious... This system is so busted
[2:07:42] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas can i play it with like an ashe adc next to me? or does it have to be something like tham
[2:07:49] j0hn_w3st: Krepo is the most elusive and exclusive DJ
[2:07:56] remixlol1: @Rodnelas Can work with anything, really just depends on the lane matchups
[2:08:01] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[2:08:31] captainfour222: w passive dmg
[2:08:32] Scarf1991: twitch will just force an ad sometimes it feels like
[2:08:35] killerwa1rus: passive dmg
[2:08:35] thelegitluke_1998: i think his w damage is an on hit thing
[2:08:36] Ixdex1: yeah, you'd need to time it from the start of the stream. It's a pain in the ass
[2:08:37] remixlol1: Thats why u run a 3minute ad at the start of the stream, no one will see it yet you´ll have 60mins of no ads after @MedicCasts
[2:08:55] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas allright, just trying to explore what to do for champpool thinking ashe, senna, taric
[2:09:00] th3royalbear: ekko stun dont do dmg itself, but it has passive onhit
[2:09:01] remixlol1: Ye but these 60min are enough to run ads after every game 2min
[2:09:05] remixlol1: which gives u 40min protection
[2:09:09] remixlol1: Which will last untill next game
[2:09:10] the_great_pine: thats a lot of hours, damn
[2:09:10] luffa__: go chempunk mr medic!!
[2:09:11] remixlol1: And then you keep that
[2:09:14] IcebergTiger: 120 hours Pog
[2:09:21] remixlol1: Ok im sorry mr streamer
[2:09:28] yoyolc: @remixlol1 which, iirc, stack - another content creator said that if you run about 15min of ads, it's 3~ish hours without
[2:09:41] BanjoCash: Kill secured EZ
[2:09:44] iLoveShy28: do u still play trackmania @MedicCasts ?
[2:09:50] CoachChaoZ: 15min ads what a banger that would be
[2:09:51] remixlol1: @yoyolc Thats straight up a lie :D Atleast nowdays, maybe back then it wasnt
[2:10:01] remixlol1: Oh wait I read it wrong
[2:10:03] magnustheboldest: what about hades?
[2:10:05] remixlol1: Idk then yoyo
[2:10:12] Epsi_long: RIOT
[2:10:23] remixlol1: 9x ashe no antiheal Kappa
[2:10:50] iLoveShy28: oh nice ill be there so
[2:11:09] Borellun: This patch is trash anyway. Health tanks are so strong, and some champs are just broken. Had a game with a 0/7 vayne, and as soon as she hit tryforce, she oneshoot everybody
[2:11:15] j0hn_w3st: 2025 Aware
[2:11:26] Cyric_Cerica: The variety of twitch ads is not big enough for 15 mins (at my location at least). Everyone would poke their eyes out after having watched the same ads 100 times during 15 mins
[2:11:28] CoachChaoZ: what are health tanks
[2:11:29] Rodacon: Is there even enough peel for Mundo? He'll block a hard CC and just keep running.
[2:11:45] Epsi_long: @dia_chaoz tanks that buy health instead of resistances
[2:11:50] remixlol1: ima brb 10mins dont lose before i come back or madge
[2:11:52] Rodacon: Apparently there is LUL
[2:11:57] Borellun: Yeah, like mundo or cho. I have cho in every game somehow
[2:11:59] luffa__: gg
[2:11:59] thelegitluke_1998: BIG
[2:12:01] Isak_Solberg: antiheal check
[2:12:13] yoyolc: @remixlol1 yeah like, she said she pressed the ad button some times (which abouts to 15min?ish) at the "starting soon" screen, which then she doesn't have to worry about it while streaming
[2:12:20] Epsi_long: true last season was the same
[2:12:30] Airfire: Oh yeah Medic did you listen to the Ruddy League drill rap
[2:12:30] CoachChaoZ: @Epsi_long but all the good ones stack resistances? what's a good one except maybe Mundo lol
[2:12:40] Ixdex1: yeah, as an assassin player i tend to avoid early season. Just feels terrible
[2:12:42] Epsi_long: @dia_chaoz cho xdd
[2:12:59] Epsi_long: and maokai prob
[2:13:09] Airfire: it's worth a listen, some very good lines in there

[2:14:24] Rodnelas: yeah medic thinks balck clover is bad /j
[2:14:35] BanjoCash: Kill secured EZ  󠀀
[2:15:06] Rodnelas: i think black clover is decent
[2:15:10] Rodnelas: batter then sao
[2:15:10] incompetent_ishac: I mean black clover has 1 good episode every 20 episodes or so
[2:15:14] WaveAsakura: BC is good if you can get through the literal PAIN that is the first 10 or episodes
[2:15:20] Rodnelas: @WaveAsakura this
[2:15:24] hykn0t: if only asta didnt sound like he's screaming all the time kappa

[2:16:09] Scarf1991: no such thing as sarcasm on the internet
[2:16:24] hykn0t: black clover has strong elements but also really bad points liek most shounen anime
[2:17:01] hykn0t: only masterpieces like one piece and hxh are exceptions to that
[2:17:30] Rodacon: Would it be worth Lux going Liandry's for Mundo?
[2:17:33] Rodnelas: stupid question maybe, but when i play senna support should i sell my support item for a full last item as in that would give me 5 items and boots
[2:17:37] hero55555f: yo Medic! been a while since I have been in your chat, but I had a question; Did you look at the Ornn items and their names? imo, they are once again, bangers
[2:17:50] yoyolc: @Rodnelas no since you'd be losing the free wards
[2:18:01] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas fair enough, was just thinking about it
[2:18:08] Borellun: why crit heal red item, instead of the one with haste?

[2:31:07] Th3Juggl3r: @MedicCasts you think your midlaner will int this game again?
[2:31:16] Jeremy_The_Bear: Surely running down mid lane is the fastest route?
[2:31:18] Bilalligator: shortest route is straight down mid
[2:31:22] Borellun: could you use anivia or ornn walls?
[2:31:31] a01_phiby: mid is always fastest
[2:31:31] StreamElements: Any more tier 3 gifters in chat?

[2:54:42] itstotallyamber: Valid
[2:54:44] Rhinjob: He said he would happily terrify in an open session but they don't want that
[2:54:49] neurobrick: @cremefraiiche_ ain’t that the truth
[2:54:50] Ludique__: Hey I thought Medic said this wouldn't be a politics stream /s
[2:54:50] jaggler: i think it was that he wanted to testify, but publicly and not behind closed doors, so everyone can get the whole context and not justhandpicked quotes bei republican babies
[2:55:06] Zairon: USA politics and culture are so incredibly overrepresented here. We should be paying less attention to this clownshow.

[3:07:56] MacYodaNL: sofysNotes “Just tank it!” season 14 strats
[3:07:57] Forged__: Pyosik won Worlds without Smite, so the optimal way to play the game is to not use Smite.
[3:08:31] wisebighorn: counter arguement "shut up"
[3:08:41] itstotallyamber: Lamp, Mac medicHi
[3:08:53] Sethur: @MacYodaNL it has to be combined with "just dodge it" as counter strategy

[3:10:12] Zairon: "just tank it, that'll be 300 dollars" KEKW
[3:10:25] Borellun: just one of them, per group
[3:10:39] neurobrick: does she get the 3 minute form?
[3:10:44] DePedro49: yes
[3:10:44] neurobrick: that’s insane
[3:11:06] MacYodaNL: @itstotallyamber they are not fighting, they are having an adult discussion
[3:11:08] Borellun: same goes for cho. he can get ulti stack just from 1 per group xD
[3:11:18] DePedro49: Well, you need to be level 6, so I haven't gotten it from the first rendition of the grubs
[3:11:19] InfiniteConsortium: yeah jonkos has her right at the top of his solo q tier list
[3:11:24] hopellesboi: i mean she only gets one from the three grubs
[3:11:26] neurobrick: they need to patch that shit post haste
[3:11:50] Ludique__: I'm noob, did she get full form from first herald last season?
[3:11:58] DePedro49: @Ludique__ Yes
[3:11:59] hopellesboi: @Ludique__ yes
[3:12:05] DePedro49: Provided she was level 6, of course
[3:12:25] Borellun: kill her, she loses it xdd
[3:12:27] Ludique__: Ah yeah thats interesting
[3:12:30] Livic_28: i bought malignance on Ashe yesterday it is kinda cool on her u should try xdd
[3:12:46] hopellesboi: that bel just did what i normally do. Get empowered form and than just die
[3:13:04] DePedro49: @hopellesboi I'm stil hopeful it will be the true meta one day
[3:13:07] Zairon: Which did you choose? the one that slows?
[3:13:32] Zairon: Ah yeah I tried that one too on Ashe supp still not sure if its any good
[3:13:34] daveppx: widexdd
[3:14:21] DragonsFaith: Ayo, how're games going?

[3:19:29] Duttchwolf: Been perma banning it so idk ;)
[3:19:38] DePedro49: But didn't you get it from first herald too? First void grubs are too early for her to have ult unlocked
[3:19:41] hykn0t: @Duttchwolf lmao

[3:19:56] loaiy: 4

[4:08:35] MaraudingBacon: @XsirkaliX i think he was just right as a last boss of the game. remember part of DS is also supposed to be that the whole linking the fire is failing. making the last boss slightly weaker is also story beat. esp when his phases and literally starts being gwin again

[4:49:39] lec_airport_speedrun: And in the league community we have a critical shortage of respectable human beings

[5:37:12] lec_airport_speedrun: @cremefraiiche_ my being annoyed that there was any confusion aside, there's nothing to know, the tournament realm was on the PBE patch because that was the current iteration of 14.1, they then changed some numbers for balance, why is there ever a question if whether you're playing on the old version of 14.1 or the new version
