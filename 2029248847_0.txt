[0:35:14] Grimcreeper2025: @grodbout i dont think its not updated for the patch yet
[0:35:42] amethyst_art22: @grimcreeper2025 they changed it i think
[0:36:12] BicepSlicerBoy: Yay a Santorini stream!! Can't wait to watch and find all the bugs and busted builds. :)
[0:37:21] ucandoit69: there was one
[0:37:24] ucandoit69: last page
[0:37:26] ucandoit69: near the bot
[0:37:32] ucandoit69: page 2
[0:37:33] BicepSlicerBoy: I'm just waiting for Bel to be hotfixed....the wee little army gotta get balanced i think
[0:37:39] grodbout: you gotta make the trundle meta
[0:37:41] grodbout: HAHAH
[0:37:43] andytherat_: everyone waiting on you to set the trundle build
[0:37:51] ucandoit69: oh idk
[0:38:00] Tkochad: I use lolalytics for mine and it says triforce , titanic hydra, thornmail, spirit visage
[0:38:15] BicepSlicerBoy: @Tkochad Triforce got mega nerfed tho
[0:38:31] amethyst_art22: what changed with triforce?
[0:38:37] Tkochad: I did Diamond + but
[0:38:59] jentesama: w was hard nerfed tho
[0:39:31] jentesama: not now
[0:39:34] jentesama: i ment like months ago
[0:39:51] jentesama: when u lvl the cd doesnt go down at all i think
[0:39:52] wangstra: control f
[0:40:01] jentesama: u used to max w for attack speed but also the cd
[0:40:03] Pieftw247: Maybe just tiamat into triforce and finish hydra later?
[0:40:12] Tkochad: I only recall trundle buffs lmao
[0:40:37] Rikutochi: looks like a buff to me
[0:40:54] jentesama: then i might be mistaken, my mind is remembering incorrectly. Thought they upped W cooldown
[0:40:55] Tkochad: SMOrc you know what time it is
[0:41:12] BicepSlicerBoy: I feel like hydra would be better than tri rush
[0:41:22] grodbout: you would go hydra rush into triforce and then full tank right ?
[0:41:29] Conchubhair: I used to play a lot of trundle a few seasons ago in Dia+. PTA always felt better back then imo for jungle
[0:41:32] thedubbleblue: Hydra is a AA reset now
[0:41:42] ucandoit69: they ban anyway at least
[0:42:15] Pieftw247: Triforce is good if you want to split. Probably unneeded otherwise.
[0:42:22] Grimcreeper2025: and they banned rengar lol
[0:42:48] iiNumb3rz: Bel veth perma
[0:43:08] Grimcreeper2025: would love to resai

[0:47:58] catlover12435: oh that was crownie right?
[0:48:28] iiNumb3rz: Spica and DL were duo last night and got Vulcan on their team iirc. I'm pretty sure the game was unfair.
[0:48:29] Grimcreeper2025: you got baited by singed
[0:50:20] PigeonSenti: she needed that for matchup
[0:51:48] TimeWizardLuL: did someone play briar with new items?i she bad now?
[0:52:23] paaaanda1: from what ive seen in my games briar doesnt seem bad, but im not a jg main
[0:52:37] Whyin_: Hey Lucas do you know the supp meta

[0:53:10] mrshibasan: LUCAS
[0:53:30] Whyin_: I've never been a duo'er peepoSad
[0:53:33] AdmiralAckbrah: i would play engage support to make space for the broken heroes
[0:53:49] mrshibasan: The new Herald is you can ride Shelly now
[0:54:09] mrshibasan: And the new little things are Voidgrobs is like the Drake's gives permanent buffs to the team
[0:54:11] paaaanda1: @Whyin_ its kinda everywhere from my few games... im a support main, im preferring enchanters though
[0:54:33] PigeonSenti: okok thanks
[0:54:42] iiNumb3rz: I can honestly say I've gone for a few random trips on the herald.
[0:54:50] iiNumb3rz: It's kind of hard to steer.
[0:55:14] mrshibasan: Ngl the Voidgrobs are so good to the team you can deal true dmg and summons little void creatures to help you push turrets faster
[0:55:31] iiNumb3rz: Lol its like being bel veth for everyone
[0:56:09] PigeonSenti: just pointing out that you never lost a single garen jungle game yet
[0:56:37] lewhitehd69: 🥔

[0:57:34] Danishshadow: Didnt see
[0:57:42] Danishshadow: Kinda fucked
[0:57:55] mrshibasan: Oh yeah I wanna share for folks that play AS champs with Gale Force and why is it remove, the reason why is to make it fair for AP and AD and Gale is too OP since so Riot wants to balance out both AP and AD champs because they have more sustain items than Mages so they remove any dash items for AD.
[0:58:02] mrshibasan: Sorry about this reply..

[1:13:53] Osami100: I've been told you can fist bump in death

[4:56:22] kairin_: 😂😂😂😂

[4:56:39] remixlol1: Anyways I´ll head out and eat. Have a great stream and gl in soloq buddy <3
[4:56:51] BleachIceCream: can u do an emotes tier list? Kappa
[4:57:01] KillerB123: doner kebab
[4:57:03] BleachIceCream: best emotes to climb with
[4:57:10] iiNumb3rz: @bleachicecream the bee emotes S+
[4:57:11] Santorin: santorinSad santorinW santorinDenmark
[4:57:25] delta1397: tbh this season is the most exciting league in a while
[4:57:29] iiNumb3rz: santorinJail
[4:57:42] iiNumb3rz: I think he meant emotes in game mate
[4:58:04] iiNumb3rz: Memegod
[4:58:16] iiNumb3rz: The bruam kekw emote is s tier
[4:58:26] Grumpmeister: Rammus OK is amazing tbh
[4:58:34] ChronicallyBlazed: the rammus OK emote is the GOAT
[4:58:53] delta1397: jg
[4:58:54] iiNumb3rz: I can honestly tell you I'm getting plenty of use out of the braum emote for the both of us.
[4:59:00] sidequest76: Gangplank grinning eating citrus is top tier
[4:59:29] iiNumb3rz: Riot account doesn't have emotes unlocked?
[4:59:41] spectreOO8: seems like the only good ganks come from like talon kayne well jumpers
[4:59:52] only1fake: !retired

[5:00:01] delta1397: I love jg rn cause 2 of my mains are in a great spot, kha and noct
[5:00:10] Mavvrix: Theres no more placements?
[5:00:15] Grumpmeister: What makes Bel'veth so strong this patch/season actually? Like, she doesn't really build any of the new items (at least, in the start)?
[5:00:32] iiNumb3rz: I think the terminus is strong on belveth
[5:00:44] iiNumb3rz: Belveth is just overall strong to begin with.
[5:00:58] iiNumb3rz: Plus the 3 min form off the grubs is op
[5:00:59] Grumpmeister: True, but near perma-ban strong?
[5:01:01] sidequest76: She gets her voidlings off of the  void grubs
[5:01:02] respectedoverlord: @iiNumb3rz Oh because it works with the E?
[5:01:09] iiNumb3rz: So you can get it more often
[5:01:11] aicorpse: brand will not be really hard to gank with ? new map seems hard for none mobility jgler
[5:01:15] Grumpmeister: You still need level 6 though for the true form
[5:01:20] iiNumb3rz: Yeah I believe it works with e
[5:01:29] Grumpmeister: But true, you can get it early
[5:01:41] iiNumb3rz: True you can still get it twice by 17 mins
[5:01:46] iiNumb3rz: Second grubs and rift
[5:02:13] Grumpmeister: Pretty similar to before then though, since you could get 6 before first rift in last season
[5:02:51] iiNumb3rz: I mean you could technically get it 3 times If you farmed hard enough
[5:02:51] spectreOO8: Have you played J4 yet?
[5:02:57] spectreOO8: wonder how his ganks are
[5:03:02] alabamahammer02: Chat what's the best 3rd party app for tracking and builds?
[5:03:04] iiNumb3rz: And they didn't rush grubs
[5:03:24] Nightbot: @iiNumb3rz -> Who the heck are you? My evil twin? [stop posting links] [warning]
[5:03:31] iiNumb3rz: Lolalytics
[5:03:44] iiNumb3rz: I would rely on that for the time being
[5:03:45] alabamahammer02: ty
[5:04:02] iiNumb3rz: Idk if it's an app but the site is great
[5:04:36] iiNumb3rz: Look dude I've tried to qwq every time. And I still haven't got it down.
[5:05:14] Grumpmeister: The hawkshot was scary as well because of that
[5:05:31] iiNumb3rz: Tha k goodness for hawkshot so they got free info lol
[5:06:01] iiNumb3rz: Jng gap
[5:06:13] madham99: gg
[5:06:42] iiNumb3rz: What do you do as a jng against tryn top?
[5:06:58] iiNumb3rz: I usually ignore him because my team never baits his R out
[5:07:33] iiNumb3rz: 2 smite grub op. I was telling my friend and he thought I was trolling.
[5:07:47] MrR1ft: having a hard time choosing betweeb jng and adc as my main role, any wisdom to share to make a choise easier?
[5:08:24] Euheimr: @MrR1ft adc is dogshit rn because of the map changes bot
[5:08:42] iiNumb3rz: No I don't think so
[5:09:11] iiNumb3rz: Do you enjoy getting one shot by assassins? Play adc
[5:09:14] Euheimr: if you enjoy getting gangbanged bot then go bot Kappa
[5:09:30] Lord_Brandad: Play ADC in the jung
[5:09:45] iiNumb3rz: Do you enjoy getting flamed and pinged for everything? Play jng
[5:09:57] Fiezzari: @Santorin Are you going to make a tierlist or something? I really don't know how to build anymore in season 2024
[5:10:10] MrR1ft: i like that way of looking at it thanks
[5:11:03] Euheimr: its easier to gank bot than other lanes, but you should do what you feel is fun. Try both and see what you like most @MrR1ft
[5:11:16] iiNumb3rz: Ff15 angle
[5:11:40] Prescience2: damn
[5:12:03] Euheimr: NODDERS clearly
[5:12:05] PigeonSenti: prolly better giving the shutdown to their botlane anyway no?
[5:12:13] MrR1ft: @Euheimr thats the problem i kida like both, but i do think i will enjoy jungle more with more time invested
[5:12:35] TsunamiEyes: so buff heal monkaHmm
[5:13:06] DJ_Photik: !elo
[5:13:10] DJ_Photik: !rank
[5:13:16] iiNumb3rz: The reason I don't like adc is because sometimes your supp will feed his ass off and now you have to lane against a 3-0 samira with an entire item over you
[5:13:27] iiNumb3rz: !opgg

[5:13:54] Euheimr: @iiNumb3rz a bot lane classic
[5:13:58] DJ_Photik: Ty
[5:15:18] iiNumb3rz: Bel veth is strong
[5:15:45] iiNumb3rz: I've seen a lot of xin Zhao. I think he works well with the new items
[5:16:05] iiNumb3rz: Also I think kindred is better now
[5:16:34] TsunamiEyes: stormsurge
[5:16:38] iiNumb3rz: Also I'm gold 2 so use that in my words of wisdom
[5:17:01] iiNumb3rz: I think Evelynn kind of nuts with storm surge atm
[5:17:24] Bubbalubagus: you should always try and get one auto off on turrets whenever you can because then you spawn grubs
[5:17:29] iiNumb3rz: I mean bel veth being banned 12/17 games is all you need to know
[5:18:02] iiNumb3rz: You need 5 stacks of the gurbs for that though don't you?
[5:18:23] Bubbalubagus: i dont think so and either way he has 6
[5:18:57] iiNumb3rz: I thinks it's 5 but I'm watching on my phone and my shit eyre can't read that tiny print lol
[5:19:09] outactd: its crazy how good those voidmites are, theyre def getting nerfed imo
[5:19:11] EdgedSilver: 5 stacks gives you one grub, 6 stacks gives both
[5:20:44] EdgedSilver: WOOT
[5:20:47] outactd: l;0000000000l
[5:20:48] TsunamiEyes: KEKW
[5:20:49] maiddon: KEKW
[5:20:52] iiNumb3rz: It's so hard to steer
[5:20:53] Lord_Brandad: Nailed it
[5:21:16] maiddon: thats what sealed the win
[5:21:17] iiNumb3rz: It's like nunu ball but your wrist has an anchor on it
[5:22:02] iiNumb3rz: Do a prediction for whether bel veth gets banned or not
[5:22:51] iiNumb3rz: I have a feeling it's making it through next game
[5:23:26] EdgedSilver: I don't think they are, but they do voice together
[5:23:34] aicorpse: great playlist HeadBang
[5:23:42] respectedoverlord: Having duo q friends DansGame
[5:23:47] EdgedSilver: I'm asking in his chat

[5:28:31] spejderkongen: Yeah exactly, some games are gifted some are prelost u gotta focus on the ones u can impact! :)
[5:29:00] DJ_Photik: Games are sometimes just lost in champ select lol
[5:29:27] drivefastandfree: Teemo jungle? It's 2nd highest wr jungler on lolalytics Prayge
[5:29:39] spejderkongen: Yeah exactly thats why i stopped after 2nd bad game, got too tilted

[5:35:12] iiNumb3rz: When is the last time you forgot to buy your jng item? Mine was yesterday.
[5:35:38] EdgedSilver: grubs die too fast imo, makes them too easy an objective that has a permanent benefit
