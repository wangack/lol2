[0:18:00] JDiaz0928: Chat on a Strand Titan in your opinion what's the better exotic Warm god or Synthos?
[0:18:05] Ugo93_: Repooooooooo
[0:20:27] SirWaldeck: @JDiaz0928 worm god for most activities but not all
[0:20:38] PLZREPORTM3: @JDiaz0928 if u can keep stacking worm gods is better
[0:22:15] JDiaz0928: @SirWaldeck What activities would you defer to Synthos over Warm god? Currently using Synthos but been debating switching over to Warm
[0:22:16] BringYoAGame: Youre really lucky to find these guys on Fireteam Finder
[0:22:25] GoPrXL: How many kills does wormgod require to get 5x?
[0:23:27] Nightbot: Use code REPPO at checkout for 10% off! https://advanced.gg/?ref=SALTAGREPPO
[0:24:40] SirWaldeck: @JDiaz0928 I would just try it out to switch and see how that feels and get used to it, but in general if you cant get your stacks of worm up or keep them up then synthos should be better but worms are just better in general
[0:25:36] JDiaz0928: @SirWaldeck Gotcha, will try on Warm god...Thank you sir!
[0:26:32] SirWaldeck: @JDiaz0928 your welcome, dont hesitate to ask
[0:26:52] MoopleLoops: you can double throw spears by standing where they spawn and grabbing another after you throw
[0:26:56] BigLedoonski: warmgod is buffing your spear damage I think
[0:27:00] BringYoAGame: I spoke too soon
[0:27:01] MoopleLoops: prob scuffed if two people do that but could speed up
[0:27:14] Just_do_3li: ur speed runs are actually insane
