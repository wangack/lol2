[7:37:51] tobuwuyas: the 4 acumulations
[7:37:56] NotPixell_: its stackable instead of based off ad
[7:37:58] NotPixell_: which is weird
[7:38:03] tobuwuyas: yeah
[7:38:08] TrueVisi0n: you cant stack the passive effectively on the item since q tho
[7:38:15] tobuwuyas: true
[7:38:16] vitoocl: Trinity is core?
[7:38:21] tobuwuyas: yep
[7:39:00] tobuwuyas: although im not too sure about trinity
[7:39:13] TrueVisi0n: i dont like trinity since its just a stat item
[7:39:18] TrueVisi0n: nothing special about it
[7:39:23] TrueVisi0n: but its good
[7:39:26] Yurlhardt: seeing jax with a 60% win rate makes me physically sick
[7:39:43] NotPixell_: @Yurlhardt same, they buffed his split iirc?
[7:39:51] NotPixell_: he can melt turrets alot quicker now

[7:42:29] Brenoou_: what are you building next?
[7:42:40] tobuwuyas: i think hullbreaker
[7:43:02] NotPixell_: @tobuwuyas iirc I was just rushing Sundered Sky into Trinity but it seems Titanic is best rush by far
[7:43:25] Brenoou_: Diana could've helped her
[7:43:40] captainnimo233: force of nature
[7:43:40] amrqadi: Jogoat

[7:44:59] tobuwuyas: im crying
[7:45:18] tobuwuyas: i think hullbreaker last item would be clean
[7:45:20] NotPixell_: FoN or Kaenic Rookern seems like a must pick every game until mages are weaker
[7:45:42] tobuwuyas: @NotPixell_ yeahh
[7:45:55] goncalopenguim: huge
[7:46:00] NotPixell_: HUGE W
