[0:33:46] Tetsugiya: Tetsugiya subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Solid Solid work. Also for next challenger race I think it would be fun if every streamer had sub goals that would add sabotages. IE, go to sleep 500 subs, choose my champion for 50 gifted subs

[9:15:33] NuclearFlex: Once synthesised, testosterone is secreted into the blood and carried to target cells in the male reproductive organs. Most of the testosterone is transported bound to a specific plasma protein called sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The remainder is termed free testosterone.

[14:18:30] Smoksx: Testosterone, a steroid hormone, is essential for the development of male reproductive organs and the manifestation of male traits. Produced primarily in the testicles, it influences muscle and bone mass, red blood cell production, libido, and overall vitality. Beyond its crucial role in male physiology, testosterone also exists in smaller amounts in females, contributing to their reproductive and general well-being. Hormonal balance is vital for optimal physical and psychological health.
