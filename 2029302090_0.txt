[0:50:22] Niomah: Sense of taste diminished last night, but Covid test came up negative. If it persists I'll retest in 48 hours as new strain tends to have a false negative early
[0:50:56] Xelx12: !playlist

[0:52:11] Smoothcollie: @xelx12 The song is bottom left corner, if u wonder what the song is kaypFlower
[0:52:24] CraigDott: stormsurge is broken as it's hard to always predict its damage in team fights so before you know it half your team is dead

[0:53:12] BRBSTARGAZING: Do you think that Vex support can work?
[0:53:28] GuildedCharr: More damage on melee champs makes sense. But then they give a ton of melee champions dashs and shit
[0:53:39] BRBSTARGAZING: Singed is also super broken right now
[0:53:42] gingerj98: Teemo with the ult item is painful
[0:53:49] GuildedCharr: So that barrier to doing damage is just gone.
[0:53:52] Necrothia: like sett only needs 1 item and its really hard to win against
[0:53:53] Smoothcollie: kaypVibe
[0:54:04] theenation97: heyyyy @kaypea good luck on the new season games today!!! <3
[0:54:21] Sunnytinker: yeah teemo with mailgance is pretty good
[0:54:32] Femuline: i played brand with malignance, storm surge and luden‚Äôs and my burst dmg was just ridiculous XD
[0:54:34] BRBSTARGAZING: I big agree
[0:54:44] Necrothia: @Sunnytinker same with lux and that item
[0:54:45] Hattnissen: I saw a supp lux with 2.5 items take 70% of our carries hp in mid-game with only ult. Don't think she was very fed so there's some hope for the mages lol
[0:54:46] kaddibuggaddii: hold up HOLD UP! has the rift changed???  something looks different. like the towers are further back....
[0:54:50] SappFire7: guess you could say, there's tons of damage in league? PagMan
[0:54:58] yenczereee: right? assasin items do that when ranged champs build them
[0:55:03] GunzaPrime: @kaddibuggaddii new season, new map!
[0:55:04] Necrothia: @kaddibuggaddii yeah new map
[0:55:06] markella_andri: Fizz too is broken I think now
[0:55:08] BRBSTARGAZING: Mages finally feel good again
[0:55:13] Whiteminas_tirith: that's spot on
[0:55:19] SquirrelMaster61985: i was watching doublelift yesterday and hes predicting that adc is just going to be mages next lcs season if it stays this way
[0:55:22] kaddibuggaddii: damn... i seriosuly missed that entirely
[0:55:23] YamiCF: ngl, even tho its preseason, I am REALLY liking the new tank items
[0:55:36] Gar116: "Ok freak" LUL
[0:55:40] Femuline: to be fair fizz was broken before the patch too
[0:55:42] SappFire7: fizz is "melee" tho, he has range from lvl 3 onwards, even moreso 6
[0:55:46] Femuline: fizz been in broken state for a while
[0:55:49] arcadedani: wtf
[0:55:52] arcadedani: xD
[0:55:53] CynicalScrub: sailed away back to the fountain sadly :(
[0:56:00] ObsceneSanity: @SquirrelMaster61985 kinda was already that way last split. Lots of Karth, swain, and ziggs in apc
[0:56:12] Smoothcollie: @kaddibuggaddii Right? It doesn't look right, haha
[0:56:13] yenczereee: udyr playing mind games on them fr
[0:56:13] SappFire7: @a_e___h true, got fizz in aram, I dont play the guy. I could assassinate in 5v5 scenarios
[0:56:15] joshhopes: Tbh, I feel like I can finally play LeBlanc and impact the lanes with these new items
[0:56:17] mrshibasan: my eyes what was your jungler doing?
[0:56:30] YamiCF: no, he doesnt
[0:56:31] angeljocker1: people stop thinking the game is create for em, its for evereyone
[0:56:35] SquirrelMaster61985: @ObsceneSanity true but now its worse :)
[0:56:37] kaddibuggaddii: @Smoothcollie yeah i was seriously wondering if im having a stroke
[0:56:42] SappFire7: voidlings blocking hooks is broken imo
[0:56:43] Hattnissen: "I'm fast as fuck boy! I'M FAST AS FUCK BOY!
[0:56:58] vladii46: Vex is crazy mid laner i like it this is my main
[0:57:06] SappFire7: voidlings blocking hooks is unfun gameplay. rito said more fun in s14
[0:57:15] corsella: do you have any cursed accounts this season?
[0:57:24] YamiCF: actually, possibly, because they come out when you hit tower, so I dont know if he timed it or if it was pure luck
[0:57:35] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: hello ~
[0:57:48] Paatzi: this season feels so bad ... man
[0:57:49] notclarkyyy: did they really have to change ludens tho
[0:57:58] SappFire7: FeelsBadMan
[0:58:09] Gar116: Just getting your steps in
[0:58:13] Whiteminas_tirith: and other thing everybody always play in mid so it's so difficult to scale comparing other lane
[0:58:29] yenczereee: @YamiCF they come out when you hit wards sometimes, is it bugged?
[0:58:44] Nikodermos: so like ekko super strong ?
[0:58:50] markella_andri: Luden is good for zyra?
[0:59:00] ObsceneSanity: @Nikodermos ap champs in general at the moment
[0:59:04] YamiCF: oh, I will have to reread the item then, I dont know
[0:59:04] theenation97: are they already nerfing mage items???
[0:59:23] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea how are you finding s14 so far? I have not played yet to try it üò¨
[0:59:26] RavensWing: Malignance is better on Zyra with Liandrys due to her ult
[0:59:34] curelinzzi: They said they will give it a week before nerfs
[0:59:46] Nikodermos: @ObsceneSanity yeah thats why i mentioned the main mage melee champ
[0:59:51] notclarkyyy: also the new infernal rift is so weird
[1:00:03] kuscuk1: If they nerf the mage items wouldnt tanks be op?
[1:00:21] leggingsPT: Hi kp, how do you feel about the items lately
[1:00:36] RavensWing: If they nerf mage items which give hardly any HP then it's clear Riot hate mage items
[1:00:38] sovitiaisavampire: problem; tanks are strong with mage items, mages are barely in the meta now  riot solution; nerf mages
[1:00:53] NoBigiMigi: Hope you're having a wonderful day Kelsie kaypFlower
[1:01:11] notclarkyyy: i think the new mage items are in a good position rn
[1:01:17] ObsceneSanity: If mages/mage items get a hard nerf, i bet it will come from pro player demand
[1:01:33] leggingsPT: I played ahri yesterday I had around 15 kills I one shoted everyone. but my team wasnt doind great and the enemies were also quite stong so I still lost
[1:01:53] alejozr: Hi queen
[1:02:30] AllyWayz: im excited to try them
[1:02:35] SquirrelMaster61985: Im mainly upset at the removal of Everfrost
[1:02:38] AllyWayz: i love mages but havent had a chance to try
[1:02:39] lilJellyBeanie: hi KP! kaypFlower
[1:02:40] NoBigiMigi: how does the new season feel
[1:02:48] curelinzzi: Way better but tanks are OP you can feel it especially without liandrys being a mythic
[1:02:51] xvenix: honestly havnt played enough
[1:02:51] mrry2k: ive seen malphite be more disgusting with the new mage items than lux
[1:02:52] leggingsPT: I love the ult cd rune and new item that gives ability haste, my ult had 23 cooldown as ahri, thats op and fun
[1:02:52] LythelliaBelmont: i'm a mage main and finally feel like doing something but not being overpowerd
[1:02:56] RavensWing: Quantum has said that mage assassin items feel a lot stronger than ad assassin items in this current patch
[1:02:57] sovitiaisavampire: i jsut ordered some starbucks LUL
[1:02:59] CourtneyJSister: i wish they didnt change ludens :)
[1:03:01] Smoothcollie: Cait vanished kaypWHAT
[1:03:02] Bakuso_: Hey Kaypea, how is the new season feeling for you?
[1:03:03] bootaeo: I got my butt kicked by two jhins in a row and got off lol
[1:03:04] lilJellyBeanie: I feel like it does a lot of burst, but if you are against tanks, I feel like I do nothing at all LMAO
[1:03:18] MustardTiger11: as an adc main i feel like mages are strong now, not just because of the item changes but the map changes and roaming potential early
[1:03:19] Napping_Sab: i played my placements yesterday and it was mostly ad mid or akali and katarina top with tankynes
[1:03:21] SquirrelMaster61985: #Justice4Everfrost
[1:03:26] Necrothia: i'm a support main mostly tank supports but i feel like they are quite strong and some really strong but still like it does so much burst and making it a glass cannon build
[1:03:27] nexusrageHS: nexusrageHS subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! <3
[1:03:32] exorc157: mage main and I think the new items feel strong but not broken so far
[1:03:34] markella_andri: What adc is strong right now?
[1:03:49] leggingsPT: I felt like I didnt have as much mana problems as before, what do you think_
[1:03:53] corsella: is ziggs strong currently?
[1:03:56] RavensWing: Varus and Draven are the strongest adcs atm
[1:03:56] Ramex99: I like how the √≠tems are for mages but holy tanks are kinda insane atm
[1:04:08] ObsceneSanity: the trade off with mage items was you lost hp stats, so now you're walking glass cannons. if they nerf them then i feel like the balance is lost
[1:04:14] milorambaldi87: I think Kalista is supposed to be broken
[1:04:43] cymatics_crystal: that sucks
[1:04:44] cymatics_crystal: WTF
[1:04:53] Whiteminas_tirith: towers are destred so easily
[1:04:57] Sir_Bratze: i really hated mythic items, but at least u could only build 1. now u can have all the strong items
[1:05:06] Kaos4Real: hey
[1:05:10] Ramex99: Overall i feel like adcs do more too
[1:05:13] RoboLaRuez: i like how your jungler run in like that and pings after fighting without back up lol
[1:05:24] GuildedCharr: Its nice that tanks can actually be tanky though. JUst gods some of that damge they have like Kench.
[1:05:29] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: i played sion one trick i dont give a fu
[1:05:37] Niomah: I can understand not doing a whole lot to tanks. The problem is the tanks are ignoring all your damage and still able to one shot any squishy
[1:05:37] ThePeePuddle: From what I hear they removed most anti tank items for mages so might see tanks returning to Midlane more
[1:05:47] RavensWing: Teemo main, not a lot has changed for our build but nice to have more options
[1:05:48] joshhopes: LeBlanc main here, she is finally a threat again!
[1:05:48] CipherAdminShady: When Yuumi is attached it makes her untargetable
[1:05:51] izzattafactnow: did the mana from items increase?
[1:05:53] markella_andri: It feels like before.. Tanks bullying us
[1:06:06] zexras: Yeah heard K'sante Mid is super good rn
[1:06:10] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: i can literly stand and type when i m normal fed
[1:06:26] ObsceneSanity: There is a sunfire aegis with MR now. so thats fun.
[1:06:31] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: and i can 2 shot almost all mage
[1:06:40] ThePeePuddle: Might have to look for an anti tank mage to put in my rotation. What are even good mages into tanks?
[1:06:48] idckdolphins: @RavensWing yup
[1:06:48] GuildedCharr: I just discovered that Thresh souls give 1 armour and 1 AP each now.
[1:06:54] GuildedCharr: Which is insane.
[1:06:57] exorc157: I played lux mid against Cho'gath last night, and we did nothing to each other all laning phase, it was very boring kaypFreya
[1:06:59] Saffy1: did you already do your placements?
[1:07:00] Ramex99: Yesterday i got oneshot by one ccait headshot auto full crit and that never happened to me last season from what i remember
[1:07:01] Napping_Sab: oh the Jhinn ego
[1:07:08] SpellfireGaming: Mage main; I feel like I‚Äôm always fed asf but never REALLY have impact, yk. Not like when a Darius is that fed.
[1:07:16] idckdolphins: top lane feels kinda boring
[1:07:16] lilJellyBeanie: they have so much MR items for tanks, but they took out a lot of anti-tank items for mages I feel
[1:07:17] GuildedCharr: @exorc157 Did they go tank cho? That's the cowards way.
[1:07:21] Necrothia: feels like pyke is more the carry then the jhin :D
[1:07:36] ObsceneSanity: i will say top laning, the counter picks have been harsh
[1:07:55] som963: I feel like yuumi doesnt realise her best friend is cait not corki
[1:08:00] RavensWing: Teemo main, not a lot has changed for our build but nice to have more options Û†ÄÄ
[1:08:00] markella_andri: Teemo is strong now?
[1:08:17] Griffihn: "i'm just doing duumb shit atm"... isn't that basically the whole fun in LoL?
[1:08:20] izzattafactnow: teemo is always strong, non believers
[1:08:24] Whiteminas_tirith: finally corki meta or not?
[1:08:24] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: sion mid is so busted when against mage mid some times even i feels bad for the enemy
[1:08:44] GunzaPrime: what a weird baron pit
[1:08:45] Valthur: is this the new map? river looks so different :o
[1:08:49] artfulchaos9: personally i think stormsurge is op, but most things seem fine
[1:08:50] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea mages are not broken, we still get one shot by tanksü§£
[1:08:55] ObsceneSanity: Gragas and Gwen have been a disaster to lane against for me
[1:09:01] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: cus there is actually nothing mage can do to stop me push and hit the tower
[1:09:20] theenation97: I think having a lot of MR items for tanks makes sense, tanks need to stay alive to tank lol it‚Äôs just their damage that‚Äôs disgusting
[1:09:20] reginaphalange00: @ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö bully!
[1:09:37] Sir_Bratze: league of one shots
[1:09:47] zexras: @theenation97 1000%
[1:09:51] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: @reginaphalange00 amen to that brother
[1:10:00] Frozenfruit13: remember the durability patch? Pepperidge farms remembers
[1:10:02] GuildedCharr: Does Kat build a Zekes now? More ult burn and some tank.
[1:10:03] reginaphalange00: @ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö LUL
[1:10:18] notclarkyyy: wat
[1:10:21] Eatyourfriends13: kaypComfy
[1:10:31] lowkeypopoki: Sometimes yumi q feels like a homing missile
[1:10:33] Whiteminas_tirith: what his damage
[1:10:38] izzattafactnow: i wonder how sylas will be
[1:10:42] RavensWing: Apart from Crytobloom there is zero HP in mage items compared to old ones
[1:10:48] notclarkyyy: we need more tank ap items
[1:10:52] Sir_Bratze: every mage can build rod of ages again
[1:11:01] lilJellyBeanie: you get popped in 2 shots, but you also 2 shot others. it‚Äôs a fair exchange I suppose
[1:11:17] theenation97: maybe if they made mage items like tank/brusier items where everyone is tanky and everyone is doing a lot of damage lol
[1:11:21] sovitiaisavampire: update; just got my starbucks delivered
[1:11:36] Napping_Sab: i played caitlyn i was 12-2 and i was one shot by a Sett that have a similar KDA to mine
[1:11:41] GuildedCharr: @notclarkyyy Genuninly all you need is heartsteel and riftmaker.
[1:11:44] bemyresset: did you guys see they are already considering nerfing mage items???
[1:11:54] ierbuta: so many kills like in silver/gold
[1:11:57] bemyresset: it‚Äôs crazy how fast mages get nerfed but not bruisers
[1:12:07] Napping_Sab: with only tank items btw
[1:12:10] ericaborgest: Hi friends kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[1:12:11] lilJellyBeanie: I just don‚Äôt know what is good to build anymore. liandrys feel a lot worse
[1:12:15] ObsceneSanity: i think if riot nerfs mage items its because they feel it threatens the competitive integrity of pro play
[1:12:23] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: @Napping_Sab i mean i can one shot 12-2 adc with a 2-12 sion
[1:12:35] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: sion need to be nerf
[1:12:49] Napping_Sab: @ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö with only tank items?
[1:12:53] atichii: omg
[1:12:55] markella_andri: Without drakhar what to I do WutFace
[1:12:56] atichii: that evelynn lmfao
[1:13:04] GuildedCharr: @Napping_Sab Lotta tank items give damage.
[1:13:10] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: @Napping_Sab yeah
[1:13:14] ericaborgest: so I heard this patch is the bruiser/assassin patch, is thaat true?
[1:13:29] bemyresset: I thought I saw a post today on twitter from Matt
[1:13:29] ObsceneSanity: i dont think its true
[1:13:34] bemyresset: idk
[1:13:36] eesh37: assassins are scary strong
[1:13:37] ObsceneSanity: @ericaborgest
[1:13:52] GuildedCharr: That wasn't crazy damage, but jesus that yummi.
[1:13:58] nicorasenpai: @KayPea  how is the new season so far?
[1:14:17] Clamydia: Hii
[1:14:17] ericaborgest: @ObsceneSanity I hope is not LOL I play adc and mages Madge
[1:14:19] markella_andri: Gg
[1:14:33] bemyresset: https://x.com/riotphroxzon/status/1745292206876037244?s=46&t=j9yYWMhatEc0eImqST2-DA
[1:14:42] ObsceneSanity: @ericaborgest honestly, the bot lane feels like a disaster bc of the map changes, not items
[1:14:44] RavensWing: Ori
[1:14:44] cinderellawannabe: HI KAYY!!
[1:14:53] Nev0as: annie noww plss
[1:14:56] kaithegemini: I‚Äôm playing brand mid and it feels good
[1:14:57] pascualquesillo: a lot
[1:15:04] markella_andri: Neeko is kinda strong
[1:15:04] eesh37: ori is solid
[1:15:07] digitalbin: Neeko?
[1:15:08] Whiteminas_tirith: I think they'll nerf most mage item that's unfortunate
[1:15:10] grandmakrystal: sera mid?
[1:15:10] GuildedCharr: Out of curiosity, what is a champ like Fizz and Sylas catagorized if they're not mages?
[1:15:10] Cyla_25: AANIE
[1:15:15] artfulchaos9: taliyah feels good
[1:15:16] RavensWing: Ori was pick or ban last season and is still strong yeah
[1:15:16] artfulchaos9: annie
[1:15:18] Cyla_25: ANNIE
[1:15:20] RaeByrd_: catJAM
[1:15:20] ericaborgest: @ObsceneSanity oh noo really? I haven't played yet
[1:15:21] Napping_Sab: Neeko is stronnggg
[1:15:22] milorambaldi87: Veigar does crazy damage
[1:15:24] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: @Napping_Sab one heartsteel and a suncap is enough
[1:15:25] cinderellawannabe: Im playing a lot of lux and i say that im winning most of my games
[1:15:25] nicorasenpai: annie is pretty strong LIKE HELLA STRONG
[1:15:33] Eatyourfriends13: Lux kaypCheer
[1:15:44] markella_andri: I wanna try zoe mid kaypCreep
[1:15:46] Napping_Sab: @ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö danm it's just sad
[1:15:50] MsDemonicRaven: @kaypea so I played my provisionally yesterday and I feel that riot KILLED adc...im not doing enough dmg anymore. Do you agree?
[1:15:51] Whiteminas_tirith: can u please try veigar? @kaypea
[1:15:58] manic_healer: the new items are stupid strong on veigar
[1:15:59] Napping_Sab: for ADC i mean
[1:16:11] whiteking445: Hi
[1:16:12] ÊáÇÊ±™Á¥çÁù£Ë≥£ÂÉπÂçö: yup
[1:16:13] ObsceneSanity: @ericaborgest just me getting used to the new design is all. just too many gank lanes
[1:16:15] Gar116: @GuildedCharr I'm pretty sure they're Melee mages
[1:16:25] RavensWing: Fizz is a mage assassin like Kata, Sylas is a bruiser mage
[1:16:33] ThePeePuddle: The thing is, Mage burst might be stronger this season but they also removed a lot of health from our items so we are squishy, tanks are stronger and I heard Lethality items are better now so assassins will shit on us so
[1:16:35] artfulchaos9: fizz is ap assassin
[1:16:40] Ramex99: Fizz is just ap assasin
[1:16:41] league_of_d3pression: sylas is a bruiser, fizz is an assassin
[1:16:43] artfulchaos9: sylas fighter
[1:16:44] artfulchaos9: imo
[1:17:09] Ramex99: Sylas is more like diana kind of ap bruiser imo
[1:17:15] markella_andri: Maybe is time my mid zyra to shine
[1:17:17] grandmakrystal: idk how sera mid is but it might be worth trying
[1:17:37] Cyla_25: annie is broken
[1:17:39] RaeByrd_: i missed a vex game PepeHands
[1:17:42] Cyla_25: one shots
[1:17:47] ObsceneSanity: @KayPea if you're feeling nostalgic, Brand is a beast right now
[1:17:53] Gossamer_DT: @KayPea time to break out your inner AP Kia'sa
[1:17:54] som963: Veigar is bad rn i heard
[1:18:04] digitalbin: Neeko
[1:18:07] THE_Bacon90: @KayPea hello my lovely, how are you? =]
[1:18:08] RavensWing: Diana
[1:18:09] markella_andri: Cass
[1:18:12] izzattafactnow: yasuo
[1:18:15] Goldein96: lux
[1:18:22] kellz30: If u can run AP on your ADC u should
[1:18:23] xeneskaya2: TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE TwitchConHYPE
[1:18:29] 1kevie: zoe is pretty op
[1:18:29] Goldein96: karama mage is crazy OP
[1:18:30] rescued: lux with the burn items
[1:18:30] nicorasenpai: anivia?
[1:18:32] markella_andri: Liss?
[1:18:35] Whiteminas_tirith: brand I think
[1:18:37] Ramex99: How is lux rn
[1:18:46] ObsceneSanity: Ori and Syndra were already broken last season
[1:18:46] Laughtael: Neeko, azir, ahri (situationally)
[1:18:47] Mknudsen89: Hello  miss @KayPea ! Looking good with the games! ;)
[1:18:55] HakushiZ: Storm surge is just really strong
[1:19:07] MsDemonicRaven: @kaypea I feel like riot killed adc...I don't do enough damage anymore. It's mage meta...what do you think so far
[1:19:26] lilCACTUSS9: There is no stopwatch rune anymore. Too bad. It was my nr. 1 rune for mid and supp to bait the enemy and walk away with 10 hp
[1:19:36] artfulchaos9: i think mages need nerf but some MR tank items also need nerf
[1:19:50] lewhitehd69: Chatting
[1:19:55] ObsceneSanity: @MsDemonicRaven I would counter by saying ADC got no love from the item update, so it might be just people wanting to play the new items, and adc might need to wait out the fad
[1:20:01] k0t10n: kaypArrive hello @KayPea it is I your daily reminder to remind you to put map cover on!
[1:20:22] Soliy1: @KayPea how ya finding the new season
[1:20:54] ani671: GOOOOOOD MORNING KAYPEA AND CHAT! kaypHello kaypHello
[1:20:55] allodoxaphobied: @KayPea will u do duo with Santorin?

[1:21:41] artfulchaos9: nah stormsurge def needs a nerf
[1:21:45] Whiteminas_tirith: if they nerf mage items, they have to nerf mr
[1:21:47] ObsceneSanity: @MsDemonicRaven i think the items we got are what we have for the season. i would recommend Karthus though. Tons of synergy with the new items
[1:21:59] marypuff23: Yeah not the items
[1:22:04] marypuff23: But the champs itself
[1:22:08] ThePeePuddle: Tanks are also super strong, don't see them nerfing them ever LOL

[1:25:46] RCStableSteven: @radiantwisp I think AP is the Meta for Lux.
[1:26:00] ObsceneSanity: @Napping_Sab i guess they removed alot of elo inflation this season. If you mean the same elo rank that you ended last season, its a good thing

[1:32:04] frankenfoot5: Unfortunate roam there
[1:32:06] RCStableSteven: actually the most meta response I‚Äôve seen from the highlighted message.
[1:32:07] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea when you get voidstaff and enough stacks the tanks are gonna be running

[1:36:07] jimbob_ywert: HELLO EVERYONE!
[1:36:15] jimbob_ywert: oh my gosh, a Veigar game? I haven‚Äôt see this in a while!
[1:36:21] Plausibly_Sane: @rice_mollerrice no, they just nerfed it
[1:36:24] Whiteminas_tirith: we need more and more penetration so it's difficult game
[1:36:48] shshsag: veigar E is a net for this flounder
[1:36:48] ObsceneSanity: @rice_mollerrice the max health dmg is there but the burn is gone i think
[1:37:15] rice_mollerrice: @Plausibly_Sane No, it is not the same at all - with *
[1:37:29] rice_mollerrice: @ObsceneSanity Yeah, that
[1:37:41] exorc157: I used to think Tahm was a frog for the longest time lmao
[1:38:06] ThePeePuddle: WP

[1:38:11] rishkey_: he giving you so many free stackies :D
[1:38:11] enchant_contessa: tk is such a balanced character no?
[1:38:13] shshsag: *clap*
[1:38:18] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity i was wrong, its the other way. Burn is still there, the max health dmg is gone. Its increased dmg as combat time increases
[1:38:34] FreeXe: Tanks with damage still btw :)
[1:38:44] CipherAdminShady: if he didnt miss the tongue mightve been a different outcome
[1:38:58] YamiCF: uh hey kp, dont want to backseat, just curious, do you know how to stop tahm from diving on you?
[1:39:04] rice_mollerrice: @ObsceneSanity Yeah, so it souldn't even be good here
[1:39:13] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity correct
[1:39:21] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea I think you can carry, just need to scale enough to one shot
[1:39:21] YamiCF: yeah
[1:39:34] YamiCF: the stun will stop the dive
[1:39:35] xKitton: "not backseatomg" - is backseating kaypCozy
[1:39:42] lilCACTUSS9: Everyone, don't forget how amazing you all are! You do your best and you are incredibly strong because you wake up every day no matter how hard yesterday was. Don't forget to treat yourself with something, even if it's just a candy or a snack, because you deserve it! (If I didn't watch this stream and didn't get the pea points, I would forget it myself.)
[1:39:51] YamiCF: wasnt aware, its not like the catfish comes mid often
[1:39:59] grandmakrystal: I feel like tahm Kench has been gross and broken for a hot minute now lol

[1:42:18] KinKaray: @lilCACTUSS9 You could treat yourself with Roccat and Turttle Beach Products, by using code KayPea, you get 10% off fulled priced products, did you know that!?!?! KEKW
[1:42:22] Plausibly_Sane: @rice_mollerrice the item liandry's is still there. with similar function. that's a nerf. that's clearly not removing it (entirely)
[1:42:44] OnlyBrians_RS: this brand is super afk
[1:42:52] Rocky: tahm kench is quite a champion

[1:45:24] KinKaray: @KayPea All right, I'll tone it down a bit. I won't say it next Saturday! Kappa
[1:45:30] lewhitehd69: Shruge
[1:45:31] grandmakrystal: does lich bane work well on veigar?
[1:45:38] ObsceneSanity: 10 stacks a minute seems okay
[1:45:43] digitalbin: In cooking shows people say "it's interesting" when it is barely edible.
[1:45:49] Oshanley: @KayPea I have, figuring out the new gank paths as jungler has been interesting and new objectives to focus on has been fun
[1:46:11] ObsceneSanity: win button
[1:47:05] looouuu30: is this a one off game for playing Veigar or been getting into him?
[1:47:40] Sir_FrodoBaggins: how are the new season changes?
[1:48:10] Niomah: You'll want Void and Cryptbloom I think to counter his MR
[1:48:29] Rocky: Yeah that item is insane. I‚Äôve been using it on swain into AP teams and you just don‚Äôt take magic damage
[1:48:49] Oshanley: Mid ganks are the hardest to be honest with how big the lane is now
[1:49:14] Hattnissen: broxahR
[1:49:19] dylanship: Rage quit Udyr?
[1:49:25] HakushiZ: stormsurge

[1:49:29] sharpshotlee: death cap
[1:49:29] OnlyBrians_RS: i think deathcap next
[1:49:39] Niomah: Cryptbloom also heals in teamfights, has 35% MRm and some other stuff
[1:49:44] SickeningTouchLoL: storm surge can help
[1:49:45] homantic: rabadons i suppose
[1:49:54] Niomah: er magic pen
[1:50:00] ObsceneSanity: it do be deathcap next
[1:50:02] sharpshotlee: deathcap multiplies the passive
[1:50:12] homantic: she just bought magic pen
[1:50:21] rishkey_: storm surge is funn
[1:50:24] ObsceneSanity: deathcap increases your passive
[1:50:36] Rocky: Storm surge is nuts
[1:50:47] Niomah: Corpsebloom:  +70 ability power +15 ability haste +30% magic penetration
[1:50:51] ughmarty: monkaW
[1:50:56] ObsceneSanity: nothing wrong with surge. I think thats the best part about the new items is mages have options now
[1:51:20] arcadedani: @ObsceneSanity yes!
[1:51:44] YamiCF: nice outplay button on Olaf XD
[1:51:46] Byggareebob: surge is crazy overpowered what do you mean

[1:52:16] OnlyBrians_RS: @tacobelltacos officially started yesterday, no pre
[1:52:30] SickeningTouchLoL: 300 stacks is kinda where you want to be but as long as you keep stacking you‚Äôll be just fine.
[1:52:32] tacobelltacos: @OnlyBrians_RS whaat? okay. thanks

[1:56:07] milorambaldi87: I usually play Trist. game now suggest an AP item? surge something? not sure what that is. still go kraken slayer first or statik
[1:56:15] DLeiro: the item that gives rakan that shield is a new support item that transforms from the starter item
[1:56:22] ozysx03: for a soraka :(
[1:56:28] Remixkoala: Just finished a quickj normal as my first game of the day and first time mid after new season, wtaf is happening to Syndra! Got deleted in .5 seconds evern with my Liss ult :C

[1:57:08] Waterhead30: oh shit, Vayne went On-Hit built, Terminus is a broken item atm
[1:57:19] DLeiro: @KayPea hover over rakan's starter item that gives him his wards, that's celestial opposition

[2:07:55] JYZero: ap items are supposedly op this patch, are you jwinning more then?
[2:07:58] FreeXe: So they're good on AP Asassin?
[2:08:00] unskilledanimal11: I just smashed 1 fizz with renekton mid :D
[2:08:02] Splashur: @AGENTAU123 neither is fizz
[2:08:18] AGENTAU123: ap assassins which dont rely on mana are insane with new items
[2:08:28] lewhitehd69: NOOOO
[2:08:47] 1meatsqueezer: is this a survey you are filling out?
[2:09:34] Waterhead30: mages feel fair and balance? I disagree Lux Xerath Syndra and Viktor pretty much oneshot you with new items
[2:10:14] AGENTAU123: but atlesat they skill shots, rather than point click spells like fizz
[2:10:15] FreeXe: Basically it's good on AP Assassin?
[2:11:26] Elpredator133: hello kp
[2:11:33] LGNDARYAssassin: ap items as a whole are nerfed, and mr as a whole got buffed
[2:11:49] YgorValadaress: helloooooo
[2:11:51] Rulerofcentemeters: does everfrost still exist?
[2:11:55] Mikko_p1: @Waterhead30 positioning probs, get good
[2:11:56] digitalbin: do the things
[2:12:04] Frozenfruit13: @rulerofcentemeters nope
[2:12:13] ObsceneSanity: @LGNDARYAssassin i dont think ap items got nerfed. Theyre quite good. Mage class got hurt by the loss of HP stats is all
[2:12:22] YgorValadaress: how u doing kelsie????
[2:12:22] LGNDARYAssassin: ap champs that arent mana/haste gated or have high base damage are the only ones good right now
[2:12:27] tacobelltacos: @Rulerofcentemeters nope
[2:12:48] KayPea: https://twitter.com/KayPea/status/1745493523787395327

[2:16:13] Sunnytinker: yeah the maligance items is sooo good on teemo
[2:16:20] ObsceneSanity: Malz and Velkoz with malignance is interesting
[2:16:36] mhuntersimon: are you playing on the EUW server or NA one?
[2:16:49] Oriastax: The lighting strike item is gonna be busted asf on burst mages

[2:17:23] madeliney: oh i like your hoodie!
[2:17:29] Kynetiq: Hi KP and friends kaypLove
[2:17:31] SickeningTouchLoL: the new champ looks like a fun champ to play in the midlane
[2:17:53] Loksdead: i find it very irritating to build liandry or rylay as fourth item
[2:17:56] jendueqi: hi everyone how u doing today
[2:17:56] FreeXe: Even if mages were broken, IT WOULD BE ABOUT DAMN TIME
[2:17:58] Necrothia: Did you won that game against Tahm ?
[2:18:04] YgorValadaress: YgorValadaress subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months!

[2:18:08] torge_154: Hi @kaypea kaypLove love the Season 2024 trailer
[2:18:11] LGNDARYAssassin: ap shyv is stupid, 1 ability that scales and does more dmg than most burst mages
[2:18:14] funncrazy: then why not mages play tanks
[2:18:27] arcadedani: they need to fix the tank items because we have been in like "tank season" since forever and is FREAKING STUPID xD
[2:18:29] ObsceneSanity: your team is so ap heavy :(
[2:18:31] SickeningTouchLoL: of course he is broken with his stacks.
[2:18:33] yaelkaa: di u tried cass in the new season?
[2:18:35] yaelkaa: *did
[2:18:38] funncrazy: its all about itemization
[2:18:42] YgorValadaress: ahahahaha for suree
[2:18:48] g4lle0n88: !rank
[2:18:48] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=K%C3%A6yPea%2C%20Karma%20Pengu
[2:18:52] FiveFM: Yeah, it kinda sucks that Tahm just *did not care* he just walked up every time after lvl 3.
[2:18:59] Necrothia: Just climbed my way back up to Bronze 4 started Iron 1 this season after placements
[2:19:19] SickeningTouchLoL: prediction?
[2:19:36] Oriastax: Hwei with new items has gotten be absolutely insane
[2:19:54] Oriastax: I've been loving his kit
[2:19:58] ObsceneSanity: @Oriastax wild take, but hwei felt stronger with the old items
[2:20:00] P4zzie: hellooooo Kels
[2:20:02] P4zzie: hai chat
[2:20:04] funncrazy: not melee , its all about  tanks itemization
[2:20:25] Oriastax: @obscenesanity oh fr? I haven't tried new ones yet on him
[2:20:27] mhuntersimon: lux counters tanks
[2:20:31] lewhitehd69: EZ
[2:20:35] sovitiaisavampire: nautilus just flashed
[2:20:37] sovitiaisavampire: GOATED
[2:21:07] matiasic: For me personally speaking. I dont care if tanks are hard to kill bc thats their porpuose, what bothers me is the freakin dmg they make
[2:21:10] arcadedani: listen listen! i main Kat and she is supposed to be a MAGE assasin so even for me as a Katarina main it feels unfair and stupid that that i must build her with tank items so that she does enormous damage and surpasses her dmg whit ap items...
[2:21:11] Oriastax: Hwei in ARAM is so fun, sniping with his Q->W is lovely
[2:21:17] P4zzie: tanky champs carrying more than carries? Riot doubled down on their decision, i respect it
[2:22:19] arcadedani: they need to really check tanks and their items because is incredibly unfair to go against tank champs
[2:22:23] ObsceneSanity: @arcadedani you know its fucked up that Heartsteel is a top listed item in the recommended
[2:22:53] arcadedani: @ObsceneSanity it is!!
[2:23:08] Oriastax: Lightning strike
[2:23:13] xBoomShotBaby: how are games going today? mine went horrible kaypAyyy
[2:23:58] paninigabe: my girlfriend wanst me to play league, what do i do
[2:24:03] SickeningTouchLoL: What do you think of the new champ?
[2:24:13] Femuline: i picked surrender vote bc most league players will type /surrender like their lives depend on it
[2:24:16] Necrothia: 2-1
[2:24:26] Niomah: Bleh work is getting busy, I may be back later if it calms down again
[2:24:35] mrshibasan: OMG FIRST GAME OF THE DAY I GOT JUNGLE MY TEAM IS CRAZY
[2:24:38] Femuline: @paninigabe you obey
[2:24:42] mrshibasan: EZREAL DIDN'T END THE GAME
[2:24:47] Necrothia: @mrshibasan Goodluck :D
[2:24:49] arcadedani: @ObsceneSanity they dont recommend ap items on her anymore lol only ad and tank items so they KNOW what is happening!
[2:25:00] cheeseburger215: @xBoomShotBaby i feel that i just had a seraphine adc
[2:25:00] arejaxs: i popped off the other day as adc, making enemy ff. i had 17k dmg with 1 item and some components. our top tahm had a couple of hundred more dmg than me with only tank items xD
[2:25:11] itz_broolynn: i have an esports competition Saturday for my high school
[2:25:22] mrshibasan: @Necrothia nono it finish
[2:25:24] Necrothia: @arejaxs sounds like tank alright
[2:25:26] mrshibasan: we won
[2:25:34] Necrothia: Gratz
[2:25:37] mrshibasan: but that ezreal didn't end the game
[2:25:47] lewhitehd69: pugPls üé∑ üé∂ pepeJAMJAM
[2:25:48] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity i was trying her out (it didnt go well) and was surprised to see heartsteel. at the time though i saw rocketbelt at least
[2:25:48] exorc157: my friend did Zoe support last night with luden's and stormsurge and it was so scary
[2:26:02] mrshibasan: he could have the game but taunting the enemies
[2:26:07] if0rg0t2remember: I never get the tank complaints myself, tanks like Tahm and pretty much stay in fights forever, of course they eventually do more damage. They can't burst though
[2:26:08] arejaxs: @Necrothia i thought i was MVP, just to find out tahm was at the postgame lobby xD
[2:26:11] tacobelltacos: should I just jump into ranked? is that what everybody is doing?
[2:26:12] toonnii0: the new map looks so good
[2:26:15] mrshibasan: my one more touch left
[2:26:27] iphame7: KAYBAE!!! <3
[2:26:35] xBoomShotBaby: @cheeseburger215 oof well i could imagine how that went kaypTroll not a fan of the new season so far
[2:26:36] Necrothia: @arejaxs XD i know that feel :D then again i only play support
[2:26:47] coifmonkeey: hellloo how are you? @KayPea
[2:27:02] ericaborgest: I'm finally on lunch break, no more lurking for an hour kaypCheer kaypCheer
[2:27:11] tim_the_cake: if you think mages are balanced with items wait till zoe gets items lol
[2:27:17] Oriastax: Is anyone here confident in their ability to play every role with multiple Champs per role?
[2:27:37] ObsceneSanity: @Oriastax not me
[2:27:40] arcadedani: @ObsceneSanity xD they even recommend the tank version of the hydra
[2:27:54] iphame7: iphame7 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:27:57] cheeseburger215: @xBoomShotBaby i wasnt very happy as the support
[2:27:59] coifmonkeey: tired ahahah two of my mechanics called in sick so I went to do the job myself, lifted about 2500kgs @KayPea
[2:28:02] ericaborgest: wait, what are those baby heralds????? :O
[2:28:10] tim_the_cake: @Oriastax I actually fill in ranked most years so I actually do play multiple champs per role. Maybe 3 no more than 4
[2:28:19] Kaos4Real: she did
[2:28:21] gigachadgodsu: GIRLIEEEE  My spirit got slapped away from my expired wig thanks to your mother hair's unmatched KDA PURRRRRRRRR
[2:28:31] SickeningTouchLoL: it wasn‚Äôt her flash
[2:28:35] SickeningTouchLoL: she picked it up
[2:28:50] arcadedani: @Oriastax not at all xD only mid lane and adc
[2:28:56] SpringSong: hi
[2:29:04] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity titanic? probably because heartsteel gives infinite ad, and kat procs heartsteel faster than any other champ
[2:29:07] coifmonkeey: ye was a pretty big job ahaha thats why I went myself didnt want to cancel it @KayPea
[2:29:20] xBoomShotBaby: @cheeseburger215 oh you main support?
[2:29:22] if0rg0t2remember: @ericaborgest void grubs. they give perma buffs against towers. Get 5+ and when you get a herald you also get grubs in lane
[2:29:24] lewhitehd69: catJAM
[2:29:49] ericaborgest: @if0rg0t2remember D: oh wow, I need to review the new changes lol
[2:29:50] krylick: locket
[2:29:50] Mikko_p1: the Ludens gun feels so weak tbh
[2:29:55] RavensWing: rocketbelt
[2:29:55] Sunnytinker: hexbelt
[2:30:09] if0rg0t2remember: people seem to be totally ignoring the grubs like they're pointless, its weird
[2:30:10] lewhitehd69: NOOOO
[2:30:14] xBoomShotBaby: oooof
[2:30:34] ericaborgest: thanks Xerath Kappa
[2:30:38] Oriastax: Lol I was just wondering, I play every roll but support and can perform with essentially any champion at least decently. Most at home in top lane tho
[2:30:41] ObsceneSanity: @if0rg0t2remember yeah i wont lie it tilts me when my jungle ignores it
[2:30:43] xBoomShotBaby: as a Lux main, i hate when that happens
[2:30:46] coifmonkeey: canceld my appointment with my Personal trainer tho ahahah @KayPea
[2:31:01] llucas_kx: I haven‚Äôt seen zoe for a long time
[2:31:14] car0lis: what do those new void thingys do?
[2:31:22] Oriastax: You have a build path in mind this game?
[2:31:46] ObsceneSanity: @car0lis for each grub you get, you get a stack. each stack does burn/true dmg to towers. 5+ you summon the grubs when doing damage to the towers to help do extra dmg
[2:31:51] ericaborgest: I hate versing zoe
[2:31:54] SpringSong: SpringSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 14 month streak! woah my sub ended ? lol btw did you watch new cinematic :o i'm literally fall in love to morgana :D

[2:34:42] KarolHeyaime: i play at 90 :‚Äô)
[2:34:43] sovitiaisavampire: @katiediddlebug 30fps is good enough for league
[2:34:43] frankenfoot5: It's always a good day when Briar is 1 shot like that
[2:34:55] itz_broolynn: @TMFPhoenix yessssss same
[2:34:59] LittleChewrrie: HII KAYPEA HAPPY THURSDAY! you think 138 fps is bad kaypea? try playing on like +40 kek @KayPea
[2:35:01] lewhitehd69: PeepoSHAKE <- this?
[2:35:02] katiediddlebug: @sovitiaisavampire it is, but higher helps, especially with seeing abilities
[2:35:03] ObsceneSanity: @KayPea alt-tab and go back to the game
[2:35:07] RadiantWisp: I am incapable
[2:35:10] RadiantWisp: of seeing
[2:35:14] KinKaray: @KayPea It is not that we don't see it, we're just used to it! LUL
[2:35:27] xBoomShotBaby: @KinKaray kaypLOL kaypLOL
[2:35:28] Necrothia: i see it shake @KayPea but try alt tabbing out and in the game for some it seems to fix it i hear
[2:35:30] mrshibasan: is it bad?
[2:35:32] Sunnytinker: when your fps is 30 when you play..........
[2:35:33] k0t10n: its annoying
[2:35:33] SpringSong: @LittleChewrrie she used to 240 so 130 is huge diff
[2:35:36] lewhitehd69: flaming our bad eyesight Sadge Kappa
[2:35:36] LittleChewrrie: i can see the shaking
[2:35:37] Sunnytinker: yeah thats rough
[2:35:37] ThePeePuddle: I see it it's very clear
[2:35:37] bemyresset: I see the shaking
[2:35:37] ericaborgest: oh now that you mentioned I can see it
[2:35:38] sovitiaisavampire: idk i was playing turn-based league back then Keepo
[2:35:41] frankenfoot5: Yeah I noticed that in my own game too. Idk what's going on
[2:35:45] edooby: KP, the stream is limited to 60 fps, we cant see it
[2:35:45] karamelsaus580: the shaking looks pretty annoying
[2:35:45] bemyresset: it‚Äôs clear
[2:35:45] Plausibly_Sane: i'm used to a firm 30 fps. i've never seen your stream above that *shrug*
[2:35:47] if0rg0t2remember: we can't tell as much on our ends because it caps at 60fps for stream
[2:35:50] medanibarra: i play at 60fps 60ms
[2:35:56] careesha15: mine was doing that last night, and it got very frustrating
[2:35:56] SickeningTouchLoL: who we fighting @kaypea am ready.
[2:35:56] Rocky: I don‚Äôt think we can see on the broadcast, it just comes through as 60 for us
[2:35:59] ObsceneSanity: its the cinders
[2:36:09] bemyresset: nahhh I see it homie
[2:36:10] mrshibasan: but my laptop has 160 still
[2:36:13] Undead_Vikings_Daxcraft: Yeah i noticed that too when i played for the first time since update today. So annoying
[2:36:14] LZ_cocowww: Heyyyy kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti kaypCheer kaypCheer
[2:36:17] Rocky: But I‚Äôve been noticing fps drops in my games as well
[2:36:18] frankenfoot5: It was giving me a little bit of a headache lol, I had to take some advil and stop last night because of it
[2:36:26] SpringSong: ohh still luden? I like malignant+ssg combo
[2:36:28] Undead_Vikings_Daxcraft: Thought it was just me
[2:36:35] k0t10n: how many fps do you get btw i never pay attention to fps KEKW
[2:36:38] enigmakelz: herald looks sick
[2:36:44] serif_terec: what causes the cinders? never seen them before
[2:36:46] katiediddlebug: kekw, of course he did
[2:36:53] LZ_cocowww: How are youu kaypComfy
[2:36:57] katiediddlebug: @serif_terec infernal soul I think
[2:36:59] ObsceneSanity: my monitor can only handle 144hz, so i frame capped my games
[2:37:07] Plausibly_Sane: @k0t10n top right. it's like 135-144 for her
[2:37:14] serif_terec: huh
[2:37:19] serif_terec: ty
[2:37:23] KOPrince93: Hey there how are the games going today?
[2:37:26] som963: I feel like I lost fps from this update lol
[2:37:47] krylick: I can‚Äôt see it but I play with 120 usually lol ;_;
[2:37:54] eliotxshadowfrost21: its like watching a video from the 90's on vhs again. shit looks weird af because your eyes are trained to see HD and blue ray. not see all the fuzzyness and static
[2:37:57] Frozenfruit13: I cap at 60 because that‚Äôs what my potato pc can handle but any change is frustrating so I get it
[2:38:16] RCStableSteven: cat on lap. 3 layers on while inside. the Midwest is as it should be. now to wait for the fire Nation.
[2:38:19] ruineddarha: hiii kp and chat <3 hows the new season feeling?
[2:38:26] ThePeePuddle: I do see it 100%
[2:38:27] Kowdbuff: we can see it a little bit it doesnt look that bad, the rest of the game looks fine just your character model
[2:38:28] Sunnytinker: no i can see the champ shaking
[2:38:30] sovitiaisavampire: i mean its noticeable but still it sounds silly complaining about 150 fps
[2:38:31] katiediddlebug: We can see it for sure, especially if you're used to high FPS
[2:38:32] ericaborgest: it shows 144 here
[2:38:34] ughmarty: we can see the shaking bad lol
[2:38:35] Ramex99: I see it tho
[2:38:35] Necrothia: Same here i see it 100%
[2:38:36] if0rg0t2remember: yeah I think we see it, but its very minimized due to the much lower fps
[2:38:37] ObsceneSanity: we can sorta see it. but limited to 60fps its sorta smoothed out
[2:38:40] drakemore000: did the LoL client update cause the cap or do you think your graphic drivers are capping you?
[2:38:40] yumiiru: i cleary can see it on stream
[2:38:41] 00bonta: hi kp did u try the "U" key for the new team emote ? <3
[2:38:52] quark978: it looks as if its running at like 30 fps to me
[2:39:21] frankenfoot5: Hey KP, what roles do you queue for? I feel like I always see you get your preferred role whereas I'm always autofilled lol
[2:39:25] sovitiaisavampire: i pause and unpause the stream every 3 seconds, and look at itt as a comic book
[2:39:26] KinKaray: @KayPea Well, I can see your stream at 1080p not sure if it is broadcast at 60hz or higher, but I can see the stutter. I'm checking past games to see if the stutter was there
[2:39:35] if0rg0t2remember: there chat those were the void grubs when the herald hit tower
[2:39:35] alshehabalali: Hello KP and Chat how are u all doing tonigh ? kaypCheer kaypArrive
[2:39:37] arejaxs: when ur used to a certain frame rate, u notice more. i play at 90/100 fps, i dont notice framedrops. probably would i was used to play at 240 FPS xD
[2:39:40] Rocky: Might be able to see it if I was on PC, on mobile it looks normal
[2:39:43] Rocky: Interesting
[2:39:44] ObsceneSanity: im waiting to see a teammate ride harold from base
[2:39:44] lovelyangelxoxo: Hello! Hope your games are going good DinoDance angelicLub DinoDance
[2:40:15] alshehabalali: I've been extremely busy and didn't get to try the new season. It looks good actually <3
[2:40:45] ericaborgest: last game was 240
[2:40:51] ruineddarha: mid seems so wide now
[2:40:52] Necrothia: am currently being a support main ^^
[2:41:10] if0rg0t2remember: I think this patch with lanes being a bit more safe from ganks early, and item changes you'll probably see top pop off a bit more
[2:41:12] Plausibly_Sane: i literally play at 30 fps. i use a TV for a monitor. i hard lock it at 30 on all games / streams
[2:41:21] sovitiaisavampire: LMAO ZOE
[2:41:22] Atomised: what are those flames that youre collecting? @KayPea looks like it made you speed up
[2:41:24] ruineddarha: whats with all the brand jungles xd
[2:41:27] sovitiaisavampire: SHE THOUGHT
[2:41:33] Rocky: LUL
[2:41:34] yumiiru: this is THE song
[2:41:39] Darkcyter: @alshehabalali @ruineddarha kaypHello kaypHello
[2:41:43] pusheencatt1: hey hey, how are you liking the new league changes?
[2:41:44] Darkcyter: @KinKaray kaypHello
[2:42:06] ruineddarha: @Darkcyter kaypFlower kaypFlower
[2:42:07] YenneferI: how are mages this season ?
[2:42:08] frankenfoot5: I usually get 240 nowadays too. I was down to 150 last night, but I assumed my PC was just goofing
[2:42:14] quark978: do the infernal cinders last the entire game?
[2:42:27] car0lis: what are those?
[2:42:29] AllyWayz: lol back to 240
[2:42:30] Rocky: I‚Äôll have to pay attention next time my fps tanks if it‚Äôs infernal soul
[2:42:33] quark978: that seems kinda busted lmao
[2:42:36] som963: Awaken was the best cinematic it's timeless
[2:42:38] demartysnipes: what are those for?
[2:42:42] alshehabalali: Have a great day guys I had 5 minutes and wanted to check the stream but I have to go NotLikeThis BibleThump
[2:42:49] AllyWayz: the game just wanted you to grab the flames
[2:43:00] Soliy1: quinn :o
[2:43:01] quark978: did she W to see you?
[2:43:01] if0rg0t2remember: you think its rendering them all on map no matter if they're in view? that might explain it. As soon as you collected them the fps jumped up
[2:43:01] Rocky: The ability haste stays but you drop cinders on death
[2:43:05] KinKaray: The Veigar game you had 240 FPS and no apparent stutter. The Vex game you had 200 fps avarage, and a little stutter, but not constant, the first game, the Lux, you had 240 fps and no apparent stutter. Appears to be a intermitent thing... Maybe the new map, and the changes made it the problem with some champions or animations!?!?
[2:43:13] ericaborgest: LOL
[2:43:17] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea it‚Äôs give sight for a good couple of seconds
[2:43:17] serif_terec: quinn gives vision for a bit
[2:43:19] Elpredator133: LOL
[2:43:21] lilJellyBeanie: wtf Did I just see with that damage lol
[2:43:22] ericaborgest: lethality cait lest gooooooo
[2:43:22] ughmarty: monkaHmm
[2:43:29] serif_terec: i think her passive might reveal people to? not sure about that
[2:43:31] KinKaray: @Darkcyter Hello friendo! :D
[2:43:33] ObsceneSanity: yeah you explode with cinders when you die
[2:43:37] quark978: ohhhhhhh that makes more sense, so on death you lose the buff
[2:43:38] Wolfvet_: have you seen the tf build? blue card one shots
[2:43:39] ericaborgest: the face LUL
[2:43:39] ruineddarha: what is that????
[2:43:40] ughmarty: ur back at 200 :O
[2:43:41] Rocky: You drop half I think
[2:43:41] demartysnipes: can anybody pick up the flames?
[2:43:48] Necrothia: yours lay at top turret :D
[2:43:51] demartysnipes: do they add damage?
[2:43:52] ObsceneSanity: yessir
[2:43:53] Necrothia: @demartysnipes yes
[2:43:55] Atomised: what is that?? is it in every game?
[2:43:56] ericaborgest: fps is back kaypCheer
[2:43:57] SquirrelMaster61985: i believe cinders are capped at 30
[2:44:09] yumiiru: but the dropped one dont give you ms
[2:44:10] Atomised: can someone please explain what those flames are XD
[2:44:27] ruineddarha: lol everyone has double buffs now?
[2:44:34] DarkReVenantt_: mizuzuNotess mizuzuNotess mizuzuNotess
[2:44:46] ObsceneSanity: i got yelled at by my team for not farming, but my team kept taking all the lanes so ididnt know what to do
[2:44:46] yumiiru: @Atomised they give ability haste and short amount of movement speed
[2:44:47] ughmarty: shes so fast lol
[2:44:49] lilJellyBeanie: does the cinders increase per kill, or do you just pick it up
[2:45:05] DarkReVenantt_: quinn
[2:45:17] Atomised: oh ok thanks <3 :D @yumiiru are they in every game? o.O
[2:45:28] ericaborgest: wtf cait LOL
[2:45:30] quark978: quinn is a full item up on you, so checks out
[2:45:33] lilJellyBeanie: Quinn ghost blade go zoom zoom
[2:45:35] TMFPhoenix: Good lord
[2:45:36] ObsceneSanity: very normal response, cait
[2:45:45] ughmarty: cait 0 IQ
[2:45:49] DarkReVenantt_: yeah the item and map changes made top a kill lane lol üòÇ
[2:46:08] frankenfoot5: I'm waiting til February before I start ranked, just so all the toxic diamond/emerald players get out of my elo lol
[2:46:08] drakemore000: elitist
[2:46:11] yumiiru: @Atomised i think only when the infernal drake is the first or third one, not sure. but its not in every game as far as i know
[2:46:14] ughmarty: basiilBOOM basiilBOOM basiilBOOM
[2:46:17] ughmarty: basiilHEART
[2:46:23] if0rg0t2remember: its more ego than iq. She thinks she runs the game so she's just gonna not care what others think
[2:46:45] ObsceneSanity: another reason i fully stopped playing adc is bc my teams in low elo wont let me take safe lanes to farm.
[2:46:47] lilJellyBeanie: they just like to play the blaming game
[2:46:50] Atomised: ok thanks :D @yumiiru
[2:47:06] ericaborgest: yeah it's been back for a couple minutes
[2:47:07] drakemore000: so it is just frame drops then
[2:47:08] ericaborgest: lol
[2:47:10] FiveFM: Shitty personalities don't shine... they ooze.
[2:47:11] ughmarty: maybe all the cinders are picked up?
[2:47:13] ughmarty: :o
[2:47:15] Necrothia: MAGMA TIME ^^
[2:47:21] ughmarty: nvm haha
[2:47:22] if0rg0t2remember: @KayPea it jumped back up as soon as you collected those like 5 cinders bot
[2:47:22] AllyWayz: when you picked up the cinders in the jungle it went back up
[2:47:23] FiveFM: kaypCreep
[2:47:31] ughmarty: whiner!

[2:52:43] Necrothia: WTF did that cassio build ? she's like a tank
[2:52:48] quark978: @pomaker1230 durability patch died 2 months after release tbh. All it did was make tanks stronger and more impactful to the game
[2:52:53] owlbroo: what is that that you have picked from the ground? small flames thingies
[2:53:02] pusheencatt1: it's so weird seeing the new map. didnt get to play it yet.
[2:53:06] SickeningTouchLoL: it‚Äôs time to update that map cover.
[2:53:09] SickeningTouchLoL: lol
[2:53:09] FiveFM: I actually can't abide people who are excellent players but this shitty to their teammates. It almost completely cancels out any good their skills bring to the game.

[2:54:31] SickeningTouchLoL: prediction
[2:54:31] TMFPhoenix: And its people like that, that makes it bad for others cause they acted out that resulted in a loss
[2:54:33] TMFPhoenix: I hate it
[2:54:35] ObsceneSanity: @TurtleIam Quinn backdoored the back line too many times
[2:54:56] jackson_111111: Yeah that the toplan p
[2:55:12] ericaborgest: the enemy team seemed pretty toxic too
[2:55:39] ObsceneSanity: @ericaborgest wouldnt surprise me they were responding to the cait msgs that we couldnt see

[3:01:07] markella_andri: I wanna see lissandra
[3:01:11] ObsceneSanity: neither you or cait were responsible to solo the quinn there, so not sure why your other teammates didnt respond
[3:01:27] Deethex: People in league have the "protagonist syndrome" quite a lot. Nobody can accept to get carried, everybody needs to be the best on the team and it really loses a lot of games in my exp
[3:01:40] ObsceneSanity: viktor top
[3:01:43] Sunnytinker: mord time?
[3:01:45] godkomi: lux support time?
[3:01:53] godkomi: oh ur top smh
[3:02:23] lilJellyBeanie: I think Quinn was someone that need like 2-3 people to deal with
[3:02:26] grandmakrystal: I don‚Äôt even think cass could match or she would just die more ü´†
[3:02:32] Sunnytinker: sometimes you dont have to be the main character, sometimes you gotta be the friendly NPC that everyone loves
[3:02:55] if0rg0t2remember: fed Quinns are hard to deal with because they can go anywhere they want so quickly
[3:02:58] korbeenoxo: it‚Äôs ranking based on lane? or it‚Äôs all same no matter
[3:03:27] lilJellyBeanie: Freya getting comfy on the twitch pillow is so cute kaypFlower
[3:03:33] ObsceneSanity: you did hide under turret the second time you died to quinn i thought

[3:05:50] rimorollin: Just curious, why do you think Syndra is too strong with the new mage items? Like what specifically do you think is too strong?

[3:48:17] RE_BlackDrag0n: ncie
[3:48:22] godkomi: ended him
[3:48:33] Niomah: English is HARD as a non-native language because it makes zero sense. We basically took bits and pieces of other languages and beat them up in a back alley to make English.
[3:48:34] ericaborgest: wp
[3:48:37] coifmonkeey: your ahri is so good :D
[3:48:45] watermeelon_juice: he turned into chicken wings when he died lmao love that skin
[3:48:52] Griffihn: @matiasic cartoons, comics, movies, tv shows. without subs, without distractions. it'll force your brain to make connections (cartoons is how you get kids to learn foreign languages the fastest)

[3:51:52] coifmonkeey: See you later, time to play some padel @KayPea gl on the game

[4:03:05] Rincewurst: @sportbinde interesting name o.O
[4:03:08] Kowdbuff: quick cast on plus the checkbox for indicators lets you hold down an ability to see the range
