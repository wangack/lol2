[8:15:28] Faaret: For midlane and the streets
[8:15:28] WatchDogzs: There is a theory about MMR, losing 1 LP is actually just as bad if not worse than losing 20, the MMR being your "real elo", LP gains adjust to your MMR, so when you lose 1 LP it's like you get 19 LPs in debt, and you gain less LPs over time until you paid it all (like you win 18 LPs instead of 20), this is only speculations but that makes sense to me
