[0:26:12] DaBonBonEK: and liandrys dmg got gutted as well
[0:26:15] APCh0pstixx: @DaBonBonEK They took haste off? damnnnnnn

[0:26:29] bullszie: haste is curcial for ap shaco
[0:26:34] APCh0pstixx: AD meta?
[0:26:40] bullszie: as of now nothing brings enough haste
[0:26:43] DeltSong: Liandries + Shadowflame makes you a box kill secure cause liandries cries thigh
[0:26:50] ruanruan: meta is 100% ap
[0:26:56] APCh0pstixx: I meant for Shaco
[0:26:56] DavidN_ttv: HELLO DAD

[0:27:14] APCh0pstixx: I know mage's are busted this season

[0:31:59] L0rdKrat0s: have you seen that splitpush item, i mean the buff that it got
[0:31:59] DaBonBonEK: cosmic into ludens worked best for me tbh. feels bad

[0:33:19] L0rdKrat0s: titanic hydra is core
[0:33:25] DaBonBonEK: yeah you need liandrys but ~60 haste is priority. cosmic, ludens, liandrys. its not good, a lot weaker than it used to be but its best i've tried
[0:33:30] L0rdKrat0s: its more ad/less tanky now
[0:33:38] DaBonBonEK: DaBonBonEK subscribed with Prime.

[0:41:19] Seanroni: @L0rdKrat0s really
[0:41:26] Seanroni: seems like shaco would struggle to get shojin stacks
[0:41:35] L0rdKrat0s: @Seanroni it doesnt work that way
[0:41:36] dridynxx: Ye I don't think youre good enough. Uninstall thank you

[0:42:15] L0rdKrat0s: its 50AH for all spells, and 20-30 for ult
[0:42:37] L0rdKrat0s: im gonna check and confirm exact number

[0:42:56] DaBonBonEK: as ap shaco does

[0:49:30] Ratlegs_: do you think the tiamat item is prob best starter for ad shaco?
[0:49:30] mynamehere1337: How's shaco feel?
[0:50:12] OSFrog: @Ratlegs_ yes tiamat good
[0:50:36] TellMeIlu: Idk i feel like you dont deal damage. It looks like with leta you would do more
[0:50:37] Ratlegs_: do you just get tiamat then finish it later
[0:51:00] steakNshaco: @TellMeIlu I'm with now, not having an early dirk feels bad for ganks
[0:51:37] DaBonBonEK: but with tiamat you can actually farm jg. also tiamat is more dmg than dirk due to active
[0:51:37] OSFrog: @Ratlegs_ propane hydra is good if youre going glass cannon otherwise i would go tiamat>bork>titanic
[0:52:45] Ratlegs_: @OSFrog i seeee, even going tiamat would you still put 3 points into w early?
[0:53:13] brandinipanini: another day to gain some lp
[0:53:19] DaBonBonEK: but i also like to put 2 or 3 lvls into Q before maxing E. and with tiamat 2 lvls W is nuff imo
[0:53:35] steakNshaco: @DaBonBonEK So far I like going 3 pts into boxes again and rushing ghostblade with the bigger lanes. Still figuring it out though
[0:53:38] DaBonBonEK: as ad THAT IS
[0:53:50] TellMeIlu: Ye. You are right
[0:53:52] DaBonBonEK: I hate ghostblade xd
[0:54:02] TellMeIlu: With tiamat maxing w is pointless
[0:54:40] DaBonBonEK: buffs are more tanky now i think. they take long to farm so there is some merit to more pts in W
[0:54:58] TellMeIlu: Now ye, but before botrk you didnt
[0:55:05] TellMeIlu: xD
[0:57:48] DaBonBonEK: also damn, playing ad shaco with nami E feels SO nice

[3:41:51] cody_and_beard: I like the Tiamat rush
[3:41:55] MrPepperJams: good value for money early back i think, don't know all the details tbh
[3:42:27] Chaewon5: @hazardlw4x yep what pepper jams said
[3:42:38] Chaewon5: since the laner items were  buffed it is good value
[3:42:46] hazardlw4x: isnt it just delaying even more your item spikes ?
[3:42:52] Chaewon5: it really is only worth though if you are planning to get agressive and look for a fight
[3:42:54] Nightbot: join chaseshaco's discord using the link https://discord.gg/chaseshaco
[3:43:10] MrPepperJams: thats why you don't wanna buy more than one of them but that is a factor you have to think about in a game
[3:43:13] cody_and_beard: The tank meta got even better this season unfortunately
[3:43:19] MrPepperJams: so it's not always the buy when you aren't even or ahead
[3:43:24] Chaewon5: @hazardlw4x yes, unless you get a kill/kills. it is not worth it most of the time
[3:43:38] hazardlw4x: ok thanks
[3:43:45] Chaewon5: @MrPepperJams buying the item from behind is what a lot of people do
[3:43:59] MrPepperJams: really?
[3:44:03] Chaewon5: so they can try and catch back up early
[3:44:04] Chaewon5: yup
[3:44:18] Chaewon5: it can be used to create a lead, or remove one.
[3:44:26] MrPepperJams: idk i just seen scrub and chase build it, not seen the other ppl who build it, and don't know alot about why they buy it
[3:44:35] MrPepperJams: just that it's good value  KEKWait
[3:44:35] hazardlw4x: it make sense on rengar
[3:44:38] MrPepperJams: * KEKW

[4:19:41] The_Young_Squire: top is so beautiful to play now, that little "fucker bush" as I call it stores the best pinks

[4:22:14] MrPepperJams: well did try arena too
[4:22:41] DaBonBonEK: arena>aram for me. now that arena is gone i played a bit aram but its way too random and unbalanced xd
[4:23:03] MrPepperJams: idk i feel aram is less random and more meta these days
[4:23:24] MrPepperJams: like ppl just play cc/tank/poke and just play back till someone messes up then all jump them
[4:23:38] Luisg681: yone so cool !

[4:29:51] Nightbot: Follow me on TikTok for some bangers https://www.tiktok.com/@chaseshac
[4:30:02] DaBonBonEK: he propably is strong but ceiling is really high
[4:30:07] shacotale: yea ppl still didnt find the right build thats why
[4:30:19] Behemoth92: he is super strong, but silvers can't play it, win rates arent everything
[4:30:35] DaBonBonEK: i think its less build, more of using abilities properly. invoker players will have easier times
[4:30:41] MrPepperJams: i mean 45% is better than what ppl thought he was valued at when he was like 23% or smth
[4:30:43] DaBonBonEK: its not silver, m+ is also 45% wr

[4:31:01] DaBonBonEK: he got buffed, too
[4:31:35] DaBonBonEK: i mean hes not any harder to build than other mages imo. new season means everyone has to figure build so thats less of a factor
[4:32:26] shacotale: yea thats why you should give him atleast a month to place him somewhere
[4:33:03] DaBonBonEK: keep also in mind that his wr is held back by unfamiliarity of ppl who play him but also his wr is boosted beacuse people who play against him have no idea how he works
[4:33:26] shacotale: aphelios 2.0
[4:33:27] DaBonBonEK: so many people not expecting 2500 range sunstrikes

[4:34:31] DaBonBonEK: hwei is too much invoker-like to be called designed by rito imo xd
[4:34:37] WhiteCrowHQ: Serpent game?
[4:35:12] shacotale: maybe but riot still doesnt know how to balance things
[4:35:58] shacotale: wait chase no mroe trinity ?
[4:35:59] misthee: I really don't like this new map. It has less meaning. The way they made it. Seems poor
[4:36:06] DaBonBonEK: they have champ oriented balance and dota has item oriented balance. thats why its much easier to balance dota. I'd say rito does fair job tbh xd
[4:36:31] shacotale: nah they good but i hope they fix client

[5:24:14] shacotale: @beasteboy28 tbh i go the tiamat into trinity into bork into upgrading tiamat into serpent fangs
[5:24:15] braindead_jungle: can't you cast Q mid-ult? Seems better than waiting for fear to proc
[5:24:26] shacotale: @MrPepperJams yea basically thats it
[5:24:43] shacotale: but when u get out of emerald u gain +30 in diams xD

[5:27:15] MrPepperJams: ngl it's been so long since i played ranked idk if thats bad or not, i assume it is KEKW
[5:27:39] shacotale: well basically i ve won 200 lps instead of 300
[5:27:58] Nightbot: join chaseshaco's discord using the link https://discord.gg/chaseshaco
[5:28:40] MrPepperJams: tbh you'd prob be getting more like +27-28 or smth and sometimes +30, i think the +30 or more in dia is compensation for how messed up emr is atm
[5:29:07] MrPepperJams: tho idk lp has been a mess for a while
[5:29:20] lunawarr: wow dragon got a LONG leash
[5:29:22] MrPepperJams: they keep changing it every year or smth
[5:29:22] shacotale: yea maybe but tbh with you i dont want a compensation in diams i just want to get atleast 25 LPs a win
[5:29:31] lunawarr: and the xin threw it
[5:29:52] Nightbot: Follow me on TikTok for some bangers https://www.tiktok.com/@chaseshac

[5:30:56] MrPepperJams: add what?
[5:30:59] MrPepperJams: LUL
[5:31:10] MrPepperJams: i think i missed something
[5:31:10] shacotale: the kda thing
[5:31:24] shacotale: like if u gain and lose lps based on kda
[5:31:33] MrPepperJams: uhhhhhhh

[5:31:51] crosisx2: AP shaco kek
[5:31:54] CarnagePatagon: Hey Chase, I know that builds vary depending on the game, but what would you say is the optimal build for Shaco now?
[5:31:55] crosisx2: was why
[5:31:55] MrPepperJams: and tbh if it is i don't think it should just be based on kda
[5:31:58] Galkaria: with the current implementation of MMR games want as close to a 50% winrate as possible. in the past lobbies were dictated by just who joined. so yes if you're a masters player with a new account your winrate will eventually go from 95% to 50%
[5:32:01] MrPepperJams: peepoHappy gg
[5:32:23] shacotale: @MrPepperJams yea but its better than winning 20 lps
[5:32:24] xDaddyxBearx: Build on Noc seemed decent. Just build Hydra
[5:33:16] MrPepperJams: shacotale ye at least it is a metric to judge things by but they do already have metrics that can use to know how well you actually played
[5:33:43] xRadioStar: thats Pink Ward
[5:33:50] shacotale: pinkward is euw
[5:33:51] MrPepperJams: idk the lp system is such a mess but i'm not a balance guy KEKW

[5:38:27] shacotale: i d rather be sisyphus and chold the rock till the top of the mountain than getting + 4 lps
[5:38:51] Galkaria: @shacotale the 4 LP is the boulder my dude, and you're still rolling it LMFAO
