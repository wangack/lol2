[1:23:47] bmaciswhack: what do you think the solution is for AP Leblanc without shiv? like what do they need to change to not need shiv anymore
[1:23:49] alex67974: statikk into ap is okay?
[1:24:24] iSykik: is there much difference in dmg for ap and ad lb
[1:24:34] Arabian_Night: @bobqinxd what if they fix leblanc by adding a passive that makes her do extra dmg when coming out of stealth/no vision
[1:24:50] k6gon: i just went ap leblanc and forgot about static
[1:24:57] Arabian_Night: @bobqinxd to reward goo vision
[1:25:14] k6gon: i finished 3-14-16
[1:26:11] k6gon: yeah
[1:26:16] k6gon: i feel bad
[1:26:22] ScoobyDoomer: can u show new ap once again please?
[1:26:24] k6gon: i lost 30 lp
[1:26:59] thegodsam01: i played leblanc ad but a i think its way to harder to play
[1:27:02] alex67974: is more of a champion problem not item issues
[1:27:05] ScoobyDoomer: but i guess its not that easy to dodge lb dash, its not that slow, right?
[1:27:45] JCPenniless: I miss the ooooold LB Q max poke build
[1:27:55] Rebelth: thats how all ap chamsp work
[1:28:55] ChampionshipLeBlanc: play tf
[1:29:06] ScoobyDoomer: imo they could give like 0.25s/0.5s  more for CC on e
[1:29:19] Eoghanhealy: would you rather see her reworked or are you happy playing her this way with stattik?
[1:29:30] Arabian_Night: Yeah a 30/0 poppy is a disgusting raid boss
[1:29:33] ChampionshipLeBlanc: POG ACTUAL TF TIME
[1:29:34] Nightbot: Bob finally made a decent play bobqinPOGGERS only did it 10566 times though... bobqinLebCHILLING
[1:29:37] Arabian_Night: cause that champ is cursed
[1:30:12] ChampionshipLeBlanc: peepoRiot we wanna see tf
[1:30:43] ChampionshipLeBlanc: stormsurge yone Pog
[1:30:49] xdBatonas: I saw navori on yone
[1:30:56] Arabian_Night: @bobqinxd thats why the only way I see leblanc being fun again is to either give her on-hit rework for your demon build, or give her passive to reward good vision control and make her super assassiny
[1:31:06] Arabian_Night: @bobqinxd like an AP qiyana
[1:32:08] pasagoaa: i saw health pot on yone
[1:32:32] 23vulture: wards 4 suckers #confirmd
[1:32:35] noxaurais: map awareness OP
[1:33:24] klatzlol: @bobqinxd how can we win against the fed evelyn last game?
[1:33:33] hoolyganlol: akali will shaft u with the new items Sadge
[1:33:52] ChampionshipLeBlanc: i think they should rework lb's passive so its 9 clones instead of one after she exits stealth
[1:33:53] Arabian_Night: akali S++ tier with new items yeah ur fcked
[1:34:00] Arabian_Night: @ChampionshipLeBlanc Xd
[1:34:28] Arabian_Night: @ChampionshipLeBlanc How about her clone summons a bunch of Shaco clones that put down boxes
[1:34:45] hoolyganlol: @Arabian_Night tho, she gets outscaled by the cringe enchantes like seraphine, tanks , etc ... she good tho
[1:35:12] Arabian_Night: for sure, but a good akali much harder to shut down than a leblanc
[1:35:18] Arabian_Night: a good akali will kill at least 3
[1:35:22] ChampionshipLeBlanc: @Arabian_Night so when a clone dies it spawns 3 shacos in a triangle and when those shacos die they spawn boxes like normal? sounds good
[1:35:39] Arabian_Night: @ChampionshipLeBlanc yeah lol a much needed buff for s13
[1:35:42] Arabian_Night: s14*
[1:36:04] Arabian_Night: Or they can get rid of the mirror image passive altogether
[1:36:08] Arabian_Night: and add a new one
[1:36:23] Arabian_Night: when shes stealthed or in a bush or not in vision, all her abilitys get slightly stronger
[1:36:39] Arabian_Night: like W radius slightly higher, E lasts longer, Q marks for more dmg
[1:36:46] Arabian_Night: To reward actual good leblancs
[1:37:10] Arabian_Night: Kinda like Zoes terrain mechanic
[1:37:17] Nightbot: Did you know that you can sub to Bobqinxd for FREE!!!! with Amazon Prime? try it now. https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
