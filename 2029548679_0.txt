[3:51:12] ItchyPandaballs: I miss MHrise QoL
[3:51:12] GodHentai: rise is fun brains off gameplay in comparison, which to some is very good and some very mind numbing
[3:51:14] Cygnatus: the qol updates were so good
[3:51:22] Solaris_Jae: @quint_5s is it? I haven't tried rise yet

[3:54:11] LazilyStealth: i almost never used screamer pods lol
[3:54:14] ItchyPandaballs: I hope they don't bring the clutch claw and tenderize mechanic to mhwilds
[3:54:16] jayboohaa: diablo, the screamer pod i hate using if i runs out
[3:54:19] GodHentai: the mechanics and set up in worlds is such a good sell to the game, really makes you feel immsersed in the fights
[3:54:21] Showyconch: I see! I’m definitely excited! It seems like a game that has a lot to deliver
[3:54:22] jayyroll: HBG Sticky made it so much easier for my friends since I just focused on KOs

[3:55:47] Timmacon: builds don't matter until alatreon and fatalis damage check you.....
[3:55:48] GodHentai: respect to you hunters for grinding fatalis full set, oh boy after i beat him i passed out celiZz
[3:55:48] eehjii: do you have your house arranged here?? may we see?

[3:56:05] GodHentai: research is just another immserve part to the game
[3:56:07] DrackenSlayer: @reeenzzz if you equip screamer pods the same way you equip dung pods it will swap them out
[3:56:15] jayyroll: I play on M/KB too. I feel like a dinosaur playing on controller
[3:56:20] bobochain: fancy

[3:57:16] itsHarning: @Kobechu_ Good job! It's a fun fight when you learn it
[3:57:28] GodHentai: Im on MKB but wanna try a ranged weapon in wilds, but range on MKB made me wanna chuck my mouse
[3:57:30] Nightsass: i'm boutta boot up mhw i wanna fight alatreon now lol
[3:57:31] ThatStuff3499: It took me so long to solo Fatalis

[3:57:54] itsHarning: @itsHarning Completely valid lol
[3:57:55] jayyroll: @GodHentai I feel like I'm playing an FPS when using HBG so it just felt more natural lol
[3:58:05] agiantnugget: Rajang is a menace
[3:58:08] T3mplarr: elisMad the stupid monkey
[3:58:10] itsHarning: Man I should jump back in worlds and play with yall cool kids
[3:58:12] kazadog: lunastra absolute worst monster in the game
[3:58:13] GodHentai: just sorting through the ammo types and the inventory as well
[3:58:16] turtlet08: Kobechu_ I also hate it so much... but their armor and weapons are so good
[3:58:16] GodHentai: is the main thing
[3:58:16] Kobechu_: raging monster kirin isnt fun either
[3:58:17] Nightsass: furious rajang with longsword was cancer, never again
[3:58:22] ceepervillain: Rajang go celiSmash
[3:58:25] Solaris_Jae: @kazadog omg same hate her so much
[3:58:25] L0WK3Y_2000: You streaming this game made me come back to this game

[3:58:29] jayyroll: HBG with Slugger 5 Sticky Ammo is chef's kiss
[3:58:30] Ibupirate: with all the grind and inventory management u have to do in this game, feels like tarkov before tarkov without pvp
[3:58:30] Mrdeathbringer4: brachy is my favorite monster along with rajang
[3:58:31] Iczeke: managed to catch all the rare endemic, now they just are caged in my room for display
[3:58:32] Zelgius: Heavy bowgun is uh... not hard
[3:58:38] Jae35mm: I'm still early into IB but I love the game so far
[3:58:40] Levdolev: I despise the flying one the puts you to sleep
[3:58:41] hadowo: when people say use mantle are they referring to ghillie mantle?
[3:58:41] Kobechu_: @turtlet08 i agree armor is really nice
[3:58:47] silverninjacat: hunting horn and gunlance user here since mhu era.
[3:59:02] rwdxr: tempered kirin was the first wall I ever reached when I played way back when
[3:59:07] kazadog: hbg plays so different but once you get the hang of it its so OP its boring
[3:59:15] Kengou12: The roll speed definitely takes getting used to
[3:59:15] jayyroll: HBG gets easy with the best endgame armor possible because of the armor bonus
[3:59:21] Kobechu_: alright now on the path to Fatalis
[3:59:24] itsHarning: @silverninjacat Absolutely based, I'm HH And charge blade
[3:59:25] Mrdeathbringer4: i hate kushla
[3:59:25] turtlet08: with heavy, you can have tons of guard and then you just will never die
[3:59:26] GodHentai: its cause celine can fly to kushala, i was at its mercy Kappa
[3:59:27] ceepervillain: Kushala is annoying, but not the worst
[3:59:36] Mrdeathbringer4: nerg was fun
[3:59:38] T3mplarr: nergi is 100% a wall for most
[3:59:39] Kobechu_: @ceepervillain i 100% agree
[3:59:41] Solaris_Jae: I hated fighting kushala in the forest quest
[3:59:43] Vanilla_Coke_is_the_best: @Ibupirate ASSEMBLE celiCult CatBup celiHere CokeShakey celiWowie
[3:59:43] megapr0n: my wall rn is master rank kirin
[3:59:43] Levdolev: tempered kirin was the worst holy I forgot about them
[3:59:47] acejackson777: with the defender armor they added it makes everything pretty trivial
[3:59:52] jayyroll: Furious Rajang is the worst
[3:59:53] Ibupirate: Vanilla_Coke_is_the_best ASSEMBLE CokeShakey
[3:59:57] itsHarning: Kushala is annoying, but like managable
[4:00:00] Kobechu_: its the wind element that gets annoying
[4:00:06] turtlet08: Kushala in the forest is annoying becasue its not a lot of space
[4:00:13] kazadog: but yeah luna and at luna can fuck off
[4:00:16] turtlet08: Defender is not good for first run
[4:00:21] rwdxr: defender is good if you played a bunch but haven't played in a couple years
[4:00:32] Mrdeathbringer4: elderseal is a must for kushla
[4:00:33] eehjii: can you be on air for a long time when using IG when you have that skill that boosts stamina quickly?
[4:00:33] itsHarning: I hate when monsters have like one shot kill graplings, so I know I'm dead, but have to sit thru 20 seconds of animation lol
[4:00:38] turtlet08: LUNA. CAN. FUCK. OFF. especially in the guiding lands. I don't know why they thought that was a good idea
[4:00:38] nacl_pizza: kirin is the wost cuz its hitbox is so small and it wont stay still
[4:00:48] Fossabot: celiSwag Follow this link to join the Star Prison celiJail https://www.twitch.tv/subs/starsmitten
[4:00:50] Kobechu_: my favorite fight is probably nergigante, its the most memorable for me
[4:00:51] Levdolev: luna was horrible y’all are giving me ptsd
[4:00:53] itsHarning: Yeah kirin can be tough
[4:00:57] acejackson777: yee defender is only good if youre wanting to speed run through low and high rank
[4:01:17] kazadog: if you have dragon it contributes
[4:01:30] turtlet08: lol luckily in this game speed running High Ranks isnt an issue. Its so bad in Rise because you need High Rank material for crafting
[4:01:32] acejackson777: or if youre like moving from playstation to PC
[4:01:41] Solaris_Jae: I liked the nergi fight cuz of his theme it's so sick
[4:01:43] yohawj: Alatreon was probably my favorite fight in iceborne
[4:01:53] Kobechu_: @solarisjay yaaasssssssss
[4:02:16] itsHarning: I saw someone say that defender was made for people that aren't good enough to reach iceborn, but they wanted them to get there anyway to not have refunds lol
[4:02:17] ceepervillain: I definitely used max defender armor/weapons to get into MR. but that was to catch up to friends who were going to help me farm
[4:02:24] acejackson777: i like lunastra because of the teostra lunastra duo attack is so fucking cool to watch
[4:02:25] Solaris_Jae: Nergis theme is by far my fav

[4:03:37] meloncholei: im sad steve is not in world
[4:03:37] mir3zz: when they introduced raging brachidios I was stunned by the fight in Mhw I enjoyed it so much
[4:03:39] professorprofit: Sussy this is all I see with Lunastra
[4:03:46] ceepervillain: itsHarning Baseg B52 bomber theme is a banger
[4:03:58] DrackenSlayer: @solarisjay yeah you need to upgrade your kinsect to get the good ones
[4:03:58] itsHarning: @solarisjay You can upgrade your kinsect, speed upgrades are a must
[4:04:11] turtlet08: ceepervillain that theme gives me ptsd

[4:04:59] andwhat4: peepoClap
[4:05:16] ceepervillain: the victory theme. MHTri memories for me
[4:05:17] turtlet08: itsHarning its not that he was hard, it was that he appeared out of no where and just made a mess out of the fight lmao
[4:05:17] j_ishia: this alatreon has 80k less
[4:05:19] professorprofit: peepoClap
[4:05:24] j_ishia: it goes into the next quest which is harder
[4:05:28] itsHarning: Whoever came up with #returntoworlds is a genius
[4:05:29] turtlet08: that was a fast kill...
[4:05:36] Jojubee: dawns triumph leads to fatalis
[4:05:46] Jojubee: youll need that one completed to get the next quest

[4:06:50] Ibupirate: Adithya__ celiBork
[4:06:57] itsHarning: @itsHarning Yeah, a capcom campaign that started a few months back which is what breathed life back into world
[4:06:57] turtlet08: itsHarning yessss I love the turf war gimmick completely. But Baezl just loves entering a fight and immediately slamming into the ground and blowing things up
[4:06:59] andwhat4: brutal
[4:07:28] turtlet08: yeeee in the lore, he killed many strong warriors and then burn their armor onto himself. Thats why its all black and why he was called the black dragon
[4:07:31] professorprofit: Yeah. It adapts well
[4:07:40] AoDnightshade: Fatalis is pretty messed up
[4:07:41] itsHarning: @turtlet08 That's the gimmick after all lol, but I get how it can be annoying. My brain might just have nummed the annoyance since it's been a while
[4:07:52] DrackenSlayer: In lore: there's rumors of hunters who crafted and wore fatalis armor disappearing around the time a new fatalis appeared

[4:08:17] dragonchampion01: !hug @starsmitten
[4:08:32] turtlet08: oh also supposedly those who wore fatalis armor go insane because they contain the souls of the fallen warriors
[4:08:36] Ibupirate: @itsHarning I mean ye, the new game looks like a sequel of world with more movement mechanics like rise so makes sence that they made that campaign. But the way u frased the question made me think if was someone from the MH community
[4:08:40] dragonchampion01: Favorite design for me is Safi’Jiiva.  Hands down.
[4:09:03] voiberz: AT velk is a painful challenge tho
[4:09:07] alexhoon: what outfit are you wearing right now?
[4:09:10] jayyroll: Behemoth fight is so sick

[4:09:23] AzrakuSama: Meow
[4:09:27] itsHarning: @itsHarning Right right, I meant whoever at the capcom team lol. But yeah since wilds is console rather than switch it makes sense if it'll be more like world
[4:09:38] AoDnightshade: Ebony Odo
[4:09:39] ksaai: the behemoth fight made me play xiv
[4:09:45] itsHarning: I never fought behemoth, foo scawwed
[4:09:50] yohawj: behemoth was nice that you can have a tank set up for the fight
[4:09:53] Ibupirate: the dmc collab was good?
[4:09:57] AoDnightshade: Head is Stygian Zinogre
[4:10:04] Ibupirate: or just a costume?
[4:10:05] dragonchampion01: You know what I love most about the Alatreon fight?  His music.
[4:10:35] itsHarning: @dragonchampion01 safi is cool, but it's a bit of a shame it went from such an alien looking thing, to basically just a normal dragon imo
[4:10:42] ksaai: i thought the kulve taroth siege hunt was fun
[4:10:46] Homphomphomphomp: behemoth fight is great. Loved the way they did the Rathalos fight in FFXIV too.. very good crossover on both sides.
[4:10:52] itsHarning: Kulve is fun yeah
[4:10:57] itsHarning: I love her armour
[4:11:03] AoDnightshade: Kulve was fun until you had to fight it 600 times
[4:11:06] itsHarning: Not bog on how the weapon system worked tho
[4:11:06] Solaris_Jae: I liked xenos design because he looked very diff from the other monsters

When you fight him in this game, the music states that it’s the exact opposite:  He’s now in FULL control of his elemental powers.
