[2:04:32] GabiR17: yoooo
[2:04:35] MeiDeh: @JhunYeon vanguard should not hurt your computer, and it does not send your data to tensen
[2:04:39] XLOftw: whats Vanguard ¿?
[2:04:43] JhunYeon: surely
[2:04:44] MeiDeh: otherwise we would not have valorant players
[2:04:47] MalkioVI: why not tho
[2:04:47] JhunYeon: Clueless
[2:05:01] Wildspeaker_: @XLOftw a kernel lvl anticheat software
[2:05:15] MaDudeGaming: @MeiDeh these anticheats can also be used to hack your pc. I think there was a case like that with Genshin anticheat
[2:05:15] JhunYeon: a kernel that runs even after game is down
[2:05:16] Sakyn: yo what's the lethality build
[2:05:17] XLOftw: @Wildspeaker_ so we cant use porofessor anymore ?
[2:05:17] MeiDeh: could you imagine the backlash it would get if all your data was stored ?
[2:05:23] chopsuey21: Is jhin good this season?
[2:05:23] Lichyness: worst part abt it is if riot messes up and it gets hacked, then yes vanguard will get u messed up
[2:05:30] thRaiden4: @MeiDeh do u know how much vanguard consume in the pc?
[2:05:32] Wildspeaker_: @XLOftw that's a good question i think not
[2:05:32] JhunYeon: yea I don't play genshin but i play hsr
[2:05:40] Lichyness: otherwise vanguard does not connect to the internet until ur playing val
[2:05:43] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Vanguard can't run on pc due to lack of virtualization support. So I gonna be quitting this game
[2:05:49] Wildspeaker_: @JhunYeon you should hade already vangard then
[2:05:50] bbjorn69: yoooo taco
[2:05:56] Sakyn: @chopsuey21 yes but the role is weaker
[2:05:58] MeiDeh: @thRaiden4 it eats a bit on memory yeah

[2:06:19] thRaiden4: @MeiDeh oh, im scared bcs of that, the consume thing
[2:06:29] JhunYeon: @Wildspeaker_ vanguard is not on mihoyo games my dood
[2:06:42] Arbaddon: @XLOftw Mobalytics said that it will work with vanguard, so maybe porofessor will too
[2:06:43] Lichyness: hovering akshan to prevent tilt AHAH
[2:06:51] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Hypnosis
[2:06:54] SyrobeNA: why dont u just not show jhin at all then

[2:07:39] MisterSalzig: Hey Taco huttsHi my friend and i had an argument today about what the best jhin build is and i said its ghostblade->Hubris and then either serildas or collector. But he says crit jhin is the best...so am i right or is he right?
[2:07:41] NapNapoleon: Mind GAMING

[2:09:49] toyawithmahballs: you dont have ward
[2:09:53] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Taco, can you test up triple tonic on jhin?
[2:09:54] toyawithmahballs: jhk
[2:09:55] toyawithmahballs: jk
[2:10:16] StellarPioneers: only games I've been losing have been my supp tilting and inting for no reason, but I keep good mental <3Heading
[2:10:18] eenom: games seems wayyy shorter with void grubs
[2:10:19] StellarPioneers: <3
[2:10:23] anti_negative_: i heard titanic on jhin resets his auto ?
[2:10:26] matsosdm: its mid better than adc?
[2:10:28] anti_negative_: is that real ?
[2:10:56] StellarPioneers: @MeiDeh true, it's so detrimental. Luckily I'm in super low elo so I can carry even if my supp ints (sometimes)
[2:11:38] NapNapoleon: Midlane is harder to gank now right?
[2:11:54] bbjorn69: Im not in just super low elo im literally in losers queue
[2:12:38] MeiDeh: @PCEsJourney lucky you man, i cant get supps that fit with me yet xD
[2:12:53] vandrelan: Have yet to really dive into ranked but I'm gonna try this season. Any tips? (besides don't lol)
[2:13:03] flux3003: The champs appear so smol in the new map

[2:13:21] Twitch_muffin: YO WHAT RUNES WE GOIN SIR?? :)
[2:13:23] NapNapoleon: Unlucky.
[2:13:26] venox_dank: yo taco how you play jhin versus twitch its my main ban cause i always got a hard time with him
[2:13:49] StellarPioneers: @MeiDeh I've definitely been lucky with good supp picks. Other team mates carrying other lanes help me catch up late as well - again, I've been lucky
[2:13:53] god_apollo7: s14 map changes makes every lane so...open what are ur thoughts?
[2:13:56] Twitch_muffin: how is red side feeling in s14? people say its shit
[2:13:59] Xistentialist24: @venox_dank I struggle with Twitch too. I think it's all about remembering to poke, not trade. You have more range/
[2:14:13] Xistentialist24: And if he goes invis you just have to back away til he shows again.
[2:14:15] Kalideagarwaen: @NapNapoleon yes and no, you have more distance from the river to the center of the lane so it might be harder to gank, but it also make warding the midlane more dangerous because the jungler now has more space to fuck you up before you reach safety. that's how i see it as a jungler
[2:14:25] StellarPioneers: @IKeepItTaco What's the Dark Harvest to Fleet Footwork ratio so far?
[2:14:57] venox_dank: @xistentialist24 appreciate it
[2:15:23] NapNapoleon: Aye

[2:22:59] venox_dank: @demonminer3 He has.He said its a good item on jhin especially for players from iron to emerald elo cause they tend to fight a lot and you can get a lot of kills and stacks
[2:22:59] eenom: damn this voidgrubs damage is nuts
[2:23:02] nyxionite: hello
[2:23:12] venox_dank: Also he tends to build it second
[2:23:25] Raiverz: Miniherald value
[2:23:42] demonminer3: so, does hubris just scale infinitely, or do you lose stacks from dying?
[2:23:43] YunhoeeAteez: is sona bot better than aakshan mid

[2:24:16] rjeyem: akshan is built to capitalized the advance exp you get in solo lanes
[2:24:35] venox_dank: @demonminer3 it scales infinitely
[2:24:42] StellarPioneers: how come Sweeper instead of Farsight?
[2:24:46] venox_dank: The stacks dont go away when you die
[2:24:46] Sanguchotos: who is trying to ff lmao
[2:24:55] vandrelan: considering how much his kit cares about roaming I'm surprised Akshan isin't a jungler
[2:25:00] Xistentialist24: @demonminer3 @venox_dank The stacks only last a minute, but also they don't go away when you die lol
[2:25:00] demonminer3: @Sanguchotos i think jax

[2:56:06] GabiR17: ohj mb, nvm im confused
[2:56:20] Kalideagarwaen: @franc3scus you need to get kill for it to snowball, without anything else it's kinda weak
[2:56:42] Wivez: FF

[2:56:59] Dubster35: is it just me or do my auto attacks feel clunky ? I have the feeling of doing no damage
[2:57:01] matsosdm: when i play against cait i go fleet cause of the trades. cause she can out trade me so easy i need some life steal
[2:57:16] SimeonDelevv: thats why i ban cait
[2:57:42] SaltedIIIBlueberries: I love how you treat Janna like a pet "No! No! Bad Janna!"
[2:57:43] danielween: I ban draven I feel like there’s nothing I can do out dmg him
[2:57:44] matsosdm: @simeondelevv draven its worse
[2:58:12] XLOftw: why no Hubris 2nd ?
[2:58:13] danielween: at least with Caitlyn she’s just like peppering me draven just kills u
[2:58:27] SimeonDelevv: @matsosdm nobody really plays draven
[2:58:37] franc3scus: @Kalideagarwaen  in this game i get what you re saying but for example in a jhin vs jinx lane where you win even without items you would buy it first or still build yoomu first?
[2:58:51] SimeonDelevv: Cait is kida popular
[2:59:01] danielween: but when draven is in ur game it’s like so sad
[2:59:18] danielween: with Caitlyn u can win
[3:00:17] Kankiskan: Toughs on maw 225% ad scalling shiled on jhin?
[3:00:20] Kalideagarwaen: @franc3scus not an expert on the matter but  for me snowball item should be bought only when snowball is already established. you don't control 100% of the game so a winning match up is not a valid reason to rush such item. especially bot where you need to take your support into account
[3:00:20] matsosdm: But anyway it depends on ur supp
[3:00:36] SimeonDelevv: @matsosdm yup

[4:22:41] Corvega_: ive picked up jhin these last few days and hes so fun, i pick him when the enemy has 1 tank or less
[4:22:49] starhabit: ikeepitCOMFY
[4:22:58] shadow_boi1: @starhabit peepoSitHey
[4:23:17] noodlesandwichhhhh: even streaming music right now, you are creating a temporary copy of protected work, its illegal. but streaming platforms allows it coz of viewer engagment
[4:24:23] theLukerino: I used to get yelled at at a lab job where I didn't speak to customers because technically if a customer did call through to my phone and I was listening to music, I'd be liable to be sued for not having a radio licence POGGERS WHAT A WORLD
[4:24:26] Corvega_: nah but i love complaining too much
[4:24:27] noodlesandwichhhhh: slash deafen = challenger
[4:24:30] ThatsNasu: @IKeepItTaco well, that loophole only works for your VoD's. when some weirdo joins your stream and hears music, he can report you anyways and twitch will look into it. imho all this copyright mess is waaay too messy. i mean surely all your viewers are just here to listen to the music, not interested in your gameplay (*sarcasm sign*)
[4:24:50] shadow_boi1: @IKeepItTaco I too am using you in my computing assignment where I create a piece of software that immediately fries your CPU if you launch the Riot client
[4:25:00] tunabeard: I've found so much good music because of the stream
[4:25:16] ThatsNasu: @shadow_boi1 if you need a co-developer: hmu xD
[4:25:23] shadow_boi1: KEKW
[4:25:28] noodlesandwichhhhh: @ThatsNasu twitch will generally look into it and provide a "warning" which they legally have to do in order to conform with EU laws (InfoSoc directive). but in terms of actual effect, nothing gets done
[4:26:32] theLukerino: didn't get sued YET
[4:26:34] noodlesandwichhhhh: dont worry about all that, us gaming lawyers are here for you <3
[4:26:37] theLukerino: plenty of time

[5:16:55] ThatsNasu: @linkonmars well, then you are mostly on yourself. sounds harsh, but if you are in elo hell, your teammates are aswell and you got matched together. best tips for fixing the mmr would be to relly focus on your gameplay, mute others, try commanding your team (tacos streams are the proof that sometimes works) and overall gain basic knowledge of the game (where do you have to be on which timing, wave management, etc)

[5:19:17] ThatsNasu: @linkonmars anytime c: especially wave management and trading patterns / trading windows can give you a huge leap. after that i would try taking a dip into champion ranges (and no, you dont need to learn all 150-ish champions for that, since a lot of champions share the same ranges, so basically knowing two or three champions on each role, will cover like 90% meta picks)
[5:19:53] nyxionite: tell me what you feel, Taco ikeepitDETECTIVE

[5:28:59] Omni_Grasp: hes tilt hooking
[5:29:06] itsDrowned: @winkyface10 at that point you just gotta keep queuing
[5:29:16] itsDrowned: no matter what elo, someone has to play bad
[5:29:21] itsDrowned: thats completely out of your control
[5:30:06] winkyface10: man last 5 games i got 2 leavers and trolling bot with 10 deaths each. its impossible and with bad mmr too
[5:30:20] qiyanu_reeves: Damn, this terrain feels so exposed. Glad I gave up playing the game, I would feel so anxious with this new walls
[5:30:38] whateverlmao201: Why lucian became so popular
[5:30:39] myxelpyxel: Sadge
[5:30:50] itsDrowned: @winkyface10 the easy fix is new account, but then again is that worth it?
[5:31:03] unihorn: @winkyface10 so quit that account, the best to leave elo hell is hire someone boost you or just quit and stats with new acc
[5:31:43] pupi478: @unihorn imagine paying elo boost LUL
[5:31:55] mch2025: holy moly
[5:32:01] mish20011: u took the lantern a lil late
[5:32:05] ThatsNasu: @winkyface10 depending on elo (i didnt read the long block at the beginning) i would usggesting getting a duo in the same elo, to play with. by that you remove one variable from the equasion (and i dont mean getting boosted, i mean a genuine duo)
[5:32:51] ThatsNasu: @winkyface10 and as a top main i would suggest searching for a midlaner, jungler or support (something thats active on the map)
[5:33:12] unihorn: @pupi478 LUL yes its popular in high elo, so imo have fun playin with bad mmr is a good choice
[5:33:32] cherryxdonut: @mish20011 i mean, he kind of had to wait cos this thresh has been missing so many hooks, if he takes it early and the thresh misses again, they just both die for free ?
[5:33:51] ratthe1: i hate this side on bot now
[5:34:07] ObsceneSanity: any other adc having a hard time with the new design of bot lane? i feel like im getting ganked easier/more often
[5:34:31] ratthe1: so unplayable
[5:34:40] ThatsNasu: @ObsceneSanity i have a feeling that was riot's idea behind the change
[5:34:43] whinoot: cosmic jhin and not outlaw??? i might be dreaming
[5:34:46] ratthe1: @ObsceneSanity especially on red side
[5:34:48] unihorn: midlaner (mages) and jungle is so free this season.
[5:35:00] cherryxdonut: @ObsceneSanity no same, its mostly because of the new open area on blue side, u can get bullied so easily under tower and ganked a lot easier - at least thats how it feels
[5:35:33] ObsceneSanity: i knew i was bad, but i felt like this was maybe a bit more than a skill issue lol thanks guys
[5:35:35] M_Farzin_89: try the new titanic its an auto reset op on jhin
[5:35:39] cherryxdonut: the alcove the added bot side feels horrid

[5:51:19] HyperrTails: I respect that honestly hahahaha was so funny
[5:51:25] bladesurge_: anyone got any good tips to get rid of ranked anxiety?
[5:51:49] Nacho1: @bladesurge_ nobody cares what rank u have
[5:51:52] Nacho1: just hit queue
[5:51:54] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr i WISH i would be there... just to get a smell of the air xD i'm stuck between b and s, but i have a feeling i just dont play enough games to reliably ladder (my mmr is fine with +28, -13 ig... bbut playing like 30 games a season...) (you could say my elo is bs) xD
[5:52:00] HyperrTails: @bladesurge_ play good music in the background and if u lose more than u can handle don't force urself

[5:52:38] unihorn: @bladesurge_ touch some grass, bro got anxiety from video game ResidentSleeper
[5:52:44] StealthyCiferr: @ThatsNasu yea you need to play more xD
[5:52:46] ThatsNasu: @Nacho1 and nobody wants d!cks like this in streamchats
[5:53:34] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr but i hate playing ranked w/o duo xD i mean support main in bs elo... any more words?
[5:53:42] MattKolba: Runes?
[5:53:46] HyperrTails: ARAM?
[5:53:51] fevgatos_live: aram vibes
[5:54:01] itsDrowned: @bladesurge_ it kinda is just a "if you want to play ranked, play ranked" kinda angle
[5:54:06] itsDrowned: the game cant hurt you
[5:54:09] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr i mean i dont have a duo :c noone could stand my expectations to mental xD
[5:54:13] itsDrowned: if you lose you lose, if you win you win
[5:54:21] itsDrowned: thats the way all ranked systems work
[5:54:38] HyperrTails: for real
[5:54:42] itsDrowned: play for fun and play for your own self improvement, nothing else matters
[5:54:49] StealthyCiferr: @ThatsNasu eh just play ngl, fuck having a duo xD on my smurf, i played it to gold 4 and got placed plat 3 somehow xD
[5:54:59] HyperrTails: the new sason got ppl playing like monkeys
[5:55:18] StealthyCiferr: tbh if you need to make a smurf  and solo on that one, gt used to playing on your own
[5:55:21] itsDrowned: I think the thing people don't realise is that playing is gold is as shit as plat, and plat is as shit as eme, etc etc
[5:55:27] ThatsNasu: @bladesurge_ i would try remembering why i actually started playing the game and really get it clear that any loss or win are just some no-value numbers which dont matter at all
[5:55:29] itsDrowned: as long as your having fun, all that matters
[5:55:44] obito552: this karthus is elosanta EZ
[5:55:55] fevgatos_live: its ok u have karthus free farming... level 16 R gg
[5:56:38] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr if i do that, i'm tilted for a week after three games, i really need someone who is as calm as me, because i need such a person to keep myself cool aswell. i had a duo... but... :c

[6:00:55] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr i dontt have anxiety playing alone xD but with my adhd and other mental health issues for which i'm in therapy, i dont want to play solo support in shit-elo since i have enough mental problems, i dont need league for that xD i mean i play solo sometimes, but most of the time i'm just around helping others and such xD thats what i do c:
[6:01:15] kyulkin: are you playing titanic
[6:01:16] whinoot: @chadi1kill yea cause we're better then pros B) (jk obviously)
[6:01:22] StealthyCiferr: @ThatsNasu just blast heavy metal like me when I solo xD
[6:01:39] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr the times where i actually had a goal to ladder, is long gone :D i'm in the state of "if i play, then to make others happy and have fun"
[6:02:14] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr trust me, psytrance (anything above 136-140 is what i would recommend) works equally fine :D
[6:02:23] ramisaffour: poppy was fighting in enemy side jungle close to mid then suprised to find xerath there
[6:02:44] Zcarvalho22: btw what do you think of the new map?

[6:04:48] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr relateable :D i dont even remember how many alts i have. 7 or 8? xD becasue ppl are "i dont wanna play with your enemies :c " so a new acc gets created xD
[6:05:02] demonminer3: so, hubris only gains statues when you kill someone right? but the AD can proc off assists?
[6:05:24] ramisaffour: that frog found himsrlf in the wrong [lace at the wrong time
[6:05:32] StealthyCiferr: xD i only havae 2 now, my old main got banned and riot wouldnt tell me the reason :( so i lost 2mil mastery points on jhin, gotta earn them back
[6:05:32] Nightbot: XD

[6:05:33] ThatsNasu: @StealthyCiferr and on that accounts i also play whatever i feel like wherever i feel like and sometimes with some good vibes by plants c:
[6:05:46] vazlyka: @IKeepItTaco is jhin mid better then jhina adc right now
[6:06:28] vazlyka: thats what just happened to me, I instantly queued for mid
[6:06:59] HyperrTails: DUUUDE U're so good
[6:07:04] fura_mingo: but how much easier is the game when ppl actually listen to pings
[6:07:13] kyulkin: are you guys playing titanic on jhin
[6:07:19] whinoot: ngl sometimes i miss playing league cause looking at rakan/ezreal play and its so fun then i remember its league
[6:07:34] vazlyka: my support just solo lost me lane because the blitz played behind me all lane
[6:07:38] vazlyka: so i wasnt allowed to walk up
