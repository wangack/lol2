[5:43:55] Kronoth03: Even better make lethality on LB heal enemies
[5:43:58] xXay_y: mega nerf her ad and as scaling
[5:43:58] anti_negative_: no more autos for her lol
[5:44:01] Bruder_Omar: @Quantum I guess just make it so her dash doesnt stack shiv/lethality item
[5:44:11] drigers5: W reduces her AD to 0
[5:44:12] Highlander84: make it so each champ class can only purchase certain kinds of items
[5:44:14] Cariyla: @clueless810 She doesn't have any...
[5:44:15] KageUyagir: KEKW
[5:44:23] MHBlue: You did a thing, not a good thing
[5:44:25] anti_negative_: nt
[5:44:27] clueless810: @cariyla I know keking
[5:44:31] sp_grimmlin: low attack speed, and remove all ad scalings in her kit
[5:44:37] anti_negative_: everyones allowed to one shot people but u
[5:44:38] Cariyla: Oh.... FeelsDankMan
[5:44:39] SnazzyKame: gjNick
[5:44:40] anti_negative_: just vibin
[5:44:44] ScenicHornet: My last swain bot game would made you proud.
[5:45:06] Cairdan: Give her negative ad ratios. If you buy AD, it makes her cds longer
[5:45:10] blarggy: Hey chat, Hey Nick
[5:45:18] anti_negative_: YEP
[5:45:21] Cariyla: It's legit just the long range dash forward poke blink back thing that makes it dumb
[5:45:23] Cariyla: YEP
[5:45:30] Kronoth03: AD items and Lethality now heal enemy champs
[5:45:31] TealsPuzzles: give her 1 base AD and then +60 dmg to minions in her passive
[5:45:38] B0B3RTT: make it where her dash CD scales with AP and has a SUPER long CD base
[5:45:46] xXay_y: even ap items she just gets to jump in and press buttons for free with W
[5:45:52] anti_negative_: theyre all hella fed
[5:45:53] bmaciswhack: ye i was watching bobquin earlier and asked about shiv and he pretty much said there is no scenario you don't build it even if you are "full ap"
[5:45:54] anti_negative_: ggs
[5:46:00] Highlander84: they should give her a -100% bonus ad modifier on all her abilities and autos
[5:46:00] xXay_y: free range dash with instant recall is broken in a game like league
[5:46:12] Pelagius02: who tf is jamaica banana?
[5:46:13] AerowKnight: AerowKnight subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Lets go!! almost 1 year of quantdaddy
[5:46:18] xx_EAT_A55: super low atk speed?
[5:46:19] anti_negative_: yeah same shit when zeri is broken lol
[5:46:22] InqInc: Her ad scaling would have to be next to zero but then she can't farm
[5:46:22] perdikinho: can any champion counter such a Leblanc
[5:46:26] Grandmeridi: gut her mana growth
[5:46:26] Ezrroni: lower attack range
[5:46:34] TheLastSonOfKrypton: if you over buff her AP ratios then they won’t go Ad …..
[5:46:35] anti_negative_: u def have to rework something about the champ
[5:46:38] introvertedrat: Hey nick
[5:46:46] hitchmippo: just joined what did i miss?
[5:46:50] emnitthy: aren’t they losing to riven tho
[5:46:53] anti_negative_: they had to remove zeri procking spellblade to fix her triforce tank build
[5:46:57] sp_grimmlin: nah they changed her Q so it could last hit didn't they?
[5:46:58] hitchmippo: Ahh
[5:46:59] king_ddww: Extremely simple nerf.. remove the ap scaling off statik and make it ad
[5:46:59] anti_negative_: thats a small rework
[5:47:00] Highlander84: if you give her penalties for all bonus AD you can fix it
[5:47:12] clueless810: Moral of the story: remove or rework Leblanc YES
[5:47:15] dorylian: nerf her base attack speed?
[5:47:19] Ezrroni: just buff her ap ratios as compensation Kappa
[5:47:19] anti_negative_: crazy theyve let leblanc be like this so long tho
[5:47:20] Devroux: something something no longer proc on-hits
[5:47:21] CarpeTheGay: why not increae the uptime on her not being able to blink back?
[5:47:24] AtumKeleb: @king_ddww It doesn't have AP scaling anymore
[5:47:30] bmaciswhack: she needs wave clear in her kit in order for shiv to not be mandatory
[5:47:37] anti_negative_: wellp
[5:47:49] konungr___: @king_ddww That doesn't do shit she builds full
[5:47:52] konungr___: ad

[5:49:49] Tonkatsumeal: It might be time to play Diana lol
[5:49:52] AtumKeleb: @king_ddww None of the items she builds has AP scaling on them. They're all flat, with scalings based on level
[5:49:56] clueless810: So Diana is lichbane rush into Stormsurge Learning
