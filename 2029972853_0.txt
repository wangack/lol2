[0:51:59] BaneBladeV: we're gonna check the stat sites anyway
[0:52:03] RlyBadPlyer: acc to Phlox, some of the data the item give leads to some false assessments from players
[0:52:15] RlyBadPlyer: like Eclipse vs Bork
[0:52:41] Lazynameross: nobody is asking for stats on dcap

[0:59:00] RlyBadPlyer: @PinkWardlol Zazzak's?

[2:29:17] Cariyla: PepeLaugh
[2:29:41] MissJenella: good for lane for sure I think
[2:29:58] superzaih: How's the support meta forming up, who / which archetypes seem to be winners? Haven't had time to play yet ;_;
[2:30:12] amonwastakenwastaken: @denunciator frodan has a great post on twitter about meta comps
[2:30:26] Hook123: BIG
[2:30:31] amonwastakenwastaken: that R BIG
[2:31:07] denunciator: @amonwastakenwastaken havent seen, is emo vex one of them

[2:32:30] bladetrinity16: lethality stormrazer
[2:32:39] superzaih: Your take on support meta for soloque would be interesting to hear
[2:32:40] sisi195555: ahh
[2:32:41] Cariyla: I've seen some Sundered Sky Jhin HmmCouncil
[2:32:48] amonwastakenwastaken: @denunciator twin terror vex twitch is the best comp in his opinion and emo spat on twitch is bis or close to bis
[2:33:04] Cariyla: Because it somehow gets base crit damage instead of Jhin's reduced crit damage on proc
[2:34:51] denunciator: that seems about right
[2:35:05] denunciator: vi could go hard too
[2:35:25] Cariyla: stuntNoted
[2:35:26] denunciator: imo they shipped way too many buffs to emo at once
[2:36:51] FrawFact: @denunciator emo?
[2:36:56] Cariyla: There were like
[2:37:05] Cariyla: 10 opportunities to Malph ult there and he picked the worst one
[2:37:06] Cariyla: keking
[2:37:16] denunciator: @frawfact tft, they made quite sweeping balance changes
[2:37:18] softlysupports: malph wt? quantPeek2
[2:37:22] jeiss_v: i feel like hourglass is needed for a lot of games :')
[2:37:28] jeiss_v: a lot of dive comps now
[2:37:35] FrawFact: @denunciator ah no wonder i didnt have a clue what it is ^^ Havent done any tft at this point
[2:37:37] FrawFact: ty
[2:37:50] amonwastakenwastaken: @denunciator you don't play vi in that comp actually, since you have twin terror you play double twitch, double vex, and double pantheon/amumu depending on who you gave the tank items to, your traits are 2 guardian, 2 emo, 2 punk, 2 exec and you don't really care about the headliner trait, unless you have emo spat, punk spat is fake
[2:37:57] xCaeIum: Ugh I can’t wait for Keria Bard skin.
[2:38:13] xCaeIum: Stunt we gonna need 6 bard games min when it comes out
[2:38:25] jeiss_v: @amonwastakenwastaken this is a different language to me
[2:38:28] denunciator: @amonwastakenwastaken as in, vi with emo spat
[2:38:29] Cariyla: Yeah she pushed you during cast animation
[2:38:31] MissJenella: deleted..
[2:38:40] denunciator: cause I reckon she'll just keep punching
[2:38:43] MissJenella: I love when people redirect my ult for me
[2:39:11] denunciator: agree punk spat is fake, but I think emo spat is the TD spat of this patch
[2:39:19] denunciator: there are some units it's incredibly broken on
[2:39:46] amonwastakenwastaken: @denunciator i think if you have a spat and don't have twin terror you could play vi, pantheon, twitch, amumu, vex, poppy and give poppy punk spat, so she has a ton of free hp and ad
[2:40:04] denunciator: mmm only if you roll punk early ig
[2:40:16] Cariyla: huh...
[2:40:18] denunciator: I can see it but punk spat feels bad

[2:41:17] amonwastakenwastaken: @denunciator yeah, karthus is probably the best with emo spat, maybe sona close second, since you can't really guaranteed hit a sona until like stage 5
[2:41:26] Cariyla: wintrade on second day of season smh
[2:41:28] Hungryeyes22: @stunt why no YT stream?

[2:42:13] som963: who is the wintrader ? sry just joined
[2:42:19] amonwastakenwastaken: @denunciator yeah, it's pretty good, it's just that twitch vex is not really a comp outside of twin terror, because of all that free crit chance
[2:42:20] Cariyla: @som963 me :3
[2:42:29] Drizzel1506: 400 gold off win :(

[2:45:34] BeachBoi: Every male in my family has died in their 40s of cancer I'm not adding to those risks
[2:45:40] polture: if you dont die of cancer, you live too be old enough not to move so
[2:45:47] polture: cancer is dying of natural causes
[2:45:55] amonwastakenwastaken: @denunciator YEP also kayle reroll is really good if you are able to get metalheads, otherwise you need to get kayle 3 really early to cap out with yorick (guinsoo is fake on kayle, build GS and AP)

[7:41:15] wodaknosp: but maybe it is my build..
[7:41:19] DudeBroMaximus: LemonNation looks like he brews craft beer
[7:41:25] kairin_: I could prob go on and on lol I’m ngl ahri is also a typical design fox girl but then again like it’s cliche because it’s cute @dudebromaximus
[7:41:25] Ghostloon: GAMBA

[7:42:55] Souvie: riot needs to stop coming out with new champs
[7:42:59] Souvie: like they should just
[7:43:02] Souvie: take a year break
[7:43:22] DudeBroMaximus: @kairin_ I just don't think they stuck the landing with Kindred. The whole mask thing is cool. The shadow thing is cool. The lamb humanoid thing just feels off
[7:43:28] shadowkek__: @Souvie  focus on making old champs better
[7:43:29] shadowkek__: fr
[7:43:32] Souvie: yeah
[7:43:36] Lessgently: I remember when it was a champ every month. Good times
[7:43:42] youKry: can you really climb at support?
[7:43:44] Souvie: they already have a hard enough time balacning old champs
[7:43:44] ash_chiming: people being sexual for a lam creeps me out
[7:43:48] jinky___: jamm
[7:43:52] livingdream_lol: @souvie idk 2023 was successful in releases though right?
[7:43:53] kairin_: At the end of the day I think league artists are amazing and they’ve done such a great job though… I’m horrible at character designing. I just like to storyboard with ppls character designs
[7:44:04] shadowkek__: i thought it's impossible to climb as support
[7:44:10] DudeBroMaximus: The splash artists are ridiculously talented
[7:44:17] Couwcouw: @kairin_ august stream is fun he explains choices he did for his design
[7:44:18] shadowkek__: like all the time ur always at the mercy of ur tema
[7:44:25] kairin_: @couwcouw yaaaa
[7:44:30] kairin_: I’ve listened in
[7:44:34] kairin_: I love shit like that
[7:44:42] ash_chiming: @shadowkek__ isn’t that all roles? 🤔

[7:44:48] shadowkek__: @Amorgankuhlmann  no ur right
[7:44:50] kairin_: satisfies my inner nerd
[7:44:51] youKry: i feel like climbing as support is much harder than other roles
[7:45:12] livingdream_lol: Hey stunt are there any blind picks you're liking so far this patch?
[7:45:19] DudeBroMaximus: 90% of my games are decided by a top lane stomp, it feels like a coin flip I have no say in
[7:45:27] DudeBroMaximus: I should play top maybe lol

[7:46:21] DudeBroMaximus: Dream bubble thing is basically a lock for enchanter
[7:46:28] Souvie: what is that support item?
[7:46:35] DudeBroMaximus: You click the item and the options pop up
[7:46:47] wodaknosp: @DudeBroMaximus the damage reduce + shockwave  in some situations
[7:47:05] Souvie: POG

[7:47:30] DudeBroMaximus: @wodaknosp interesting, I hadn't considered that
[7:48:41] trowaman: I always found if you trying to climb as supp you need a champ that can carry if need be
[7:48:41] DudeBroMaximus: I've been spamming Milio games. A good Senna slaps him
[7:48:44] Belolved: why did u go dark seal on milio?
[7:48:48] DudeBroMaximus: But Senna slaps everyone

[7:50:12] isidorus_h: chat has he made comments on the new map changes yet?
[7:50:19] DudeBroMaximus: Thoughts on staff of flowing water first on Milio? The speed boost has no cooldown so it feels pretty good
[7:50:38] ash_chiming: I think he said he didn’t like it
[7:50:52] shracksta: you get 8% base on ardent anyway
[7:52:05] kairin_: @isidorus_h i don’t think he said much but you can ask him what he thinks xD
[7:52:32] Belolved: isnt ardent better before staff?
[7:52:47] ash_chiming: ardent seems better to help kindred
