[0:43:40] infiSTAR: @ApexogenesisX so far yes, probably gonna nurf !! :D
[0:44:46] Onred: man, that kernel level anticheat gonna be required to play league in a few months‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt play much to begin with, but now I‚Äôm not gonna be playing at all‚Ä¶

[0:45:19] bataan: Good last game for me, need to sleep.. Thanks for the great display Chris
[0:45:26] infiSTAR: @Onred there is nothing they could not have already done from usermode to your data or pc to begin with :)
[0:45:30] piwahXD: its like a rumble ulti ticking perma
[0:45:34] ApexogenesisX: im so glad there is no mythic anymore, not forcing you to go into a certain build all the time
[0:45:43] loex5ever: @bataan Have a good sleep singLove singWave
[0:46:39] Onred: @infistar bold to assume. but yeah, let‚Äôs just install security cameras in toilets to stop shoplifting. don‚Äôt worry the company will promise to protect privacy

[0:47:53] infiSTAR: @Onred that is no assumption, it is a fact. The only downside / problem is that it will run with windows boot and be on even if you don't run the game. However you could disable it and enable + restart before you want to play.
[0:48:00] Onred: not like I‚Äôm gonna have a choice though. I run Linux and league will just stop working
[0:48:43] Tinglenator: Bless you
[0:48:45] infiSTAR: or they just don't require it on linux :D it's strange anyways not like vanguard is going to stop the scripting
[0:49:34] Onred: @infistar yeah that‚Äôs the thing. cheating won‚Äôt stop, but they aren‚Äôt going to put rhetoric effort into allowing Linux to run.
[0:49:51] Sneh47: is this fate
[0:49:56] Onred: put the effort * wtf autocorrect?/
[0:50:00] infiSTAR: for example on Apex Legends with Easy ANti-cheat they just have you play without EAC at the beginning when they launched it for linux
[0:50:06] Sneh47: wait ive never seen saber look like that
[0:50:45] Tinglenator: What do you mean, they def have a Saber Face
[0:51:12] Onred: @infistar riot proved with valorant that they do not care about the Linux market. which makes sense now, but still stinks for that growing metric
[0:51:40] Sneh47: yea in all the other fate stuff shes blonde no?

[0:52:07] loex5ever: @Onred used to play so much super tux and the pinguin games on Linux when i was a kid LUL <3
[0:52:12] Tinglenator: so they just call them Saber
[0:52:25] Sneh47: ohh i get it
[0:52:37] Tinglenator: I'm pretty sure it hasn't been said yet
[0:52:40] Tinglenator: I might of missed it
[0:52:54] Onred: @loex5ever yeah Linux gaming is a lot more mature these days. in fact the steam deck is a full-on Linux computer
[0:53:34] loex5ever: @Onred Cool! Didn't know that
[0:54:03] Tinglenator: yeah that's why some people mod their steam decks into the ultimate handheld emulator
[0:54:27] Onred: @loex5ever there‚Äôs a lot who don‚Äôt! which is a great thing. valve has done a ton for the Linux gaming world
[0:54:53] Tinglenator: good to know
[0:55:03] Onred: it‚Äôs good when something is so seamless as to be unnoticeable
[0:55:16] loex5ever: SeemsGood
[0:56:43] Onred: but league of legends on Linux probably dies with the anticheat rollout, barring an unlikely intentional allowance for Linux, which means steam deck won‚Äôt be able to play it anymore
