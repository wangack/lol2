If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm

[2:48:34] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm

[2:52:56] 9alex97: can someone explain the new trundle build?
[2:52:58] raxxman: @itsjasmineclarke At least when you needed to go AP for that level of heal it was compromising something
[2:52:59] Vi_el: W give 25% healing
[2:53:17] Vi_el: Passive heals percent of unit killed nearby

[2:54:31] StreamElements: @be5y, be5y has been following trundletop1 for  18 secs
[2:54:37] raxxman: @Timaster5 yeah more so top than jungle because of bush placement, but he still has no real trade pattern you can counter with, outside lane phase he's not as good, but meh

[2:55:21] Rikstar360: BOOMIES
[2:55:41] GutbusterZA: @juanpants imo its when you need to have kill potential or trade value, is ignites speciality (also anti heal if needed). TP is safe and split push potential.
[2:56:00] GutbusterZA: Tp is more lane dominance and objective focused
[2:56:01] lilterp_: is it league of assassins, tanks or bruisers rn?
[2:56:08] GutbusterZA: for better cs etc

[2:56:13] Timaster5: @raxxman Ye, i am a gnar otp and last season the main problem wasn't the bushes. The main problem is the rengar heal that is way to strong, heals for a ton of HP and removes CC, that is unbalanced
[2:56:39] lilterp_: maybe they needa nerf the grey hp
[2:56:44] dodgerr2: @Timaster5 + movment speed as well
