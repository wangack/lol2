[5:33:04] CantyBloke: shaco support PogU
[5:33:05] ghosterath: @ghosterath so theres 2 ways to work out it isnt good. play yi with it, then without. its clear as day other items are better on yi. the other way to work it out is to go into practice tool and test it on a dummy. then try his normal items. damage stats dont lie.
[5:33:12] chaot3ch: @tranoze it usually depends on the enemy comp. Early w is good for skirmishes. E is for more scaling and less fighting
[5:33:15] BakaOu: worst begenning for all of us

[5:53:30] magicwinter1: What about the new item that gives you a magic shield?
[5:53:33] SuripantadeKotoriHikari: get a nature's force or whatever its called

[5:58:25] sinnerplay1: @ghosterath we'll see the damage numbers. also the champs that do a lot of  burst damage and have to back off are not as good as champs that consistently do damage and be in the fight. the latter results in useless damage a lot of times as the enemy might escape without dying
[5:58:32] SuripantadeKotoriHikari: @phase__4 bard chimes that give cdr
[5:58:33] xAstra021: now smash her. haha

[7:45:19] hnim18: Have you tried Terminus on yi?
[7:45:32] ghosterath: @hnim18 yes, its not very good.
[7:45:41] xiphETE: how long you are streaming rn  ?
[7:45:42] ghosterath: the stacking of terminus is what kills the item

[7:47:28] donelektron: xd
[7:47:31] smuckrzpeachez: lol
[7:47:54] ghosterath: @Cowsep How can you say terminus can work. It is all about tradeoffs, if you spend 3k on terminus, it means you are getting it over another 3k item. Definitely not worth
[7:48:08] mrrogers558: lol lost their turret
[7:48:45] ghosterath: yeah but the stacking mechanic is what kills it.
[7:49:06] BenL2418: Have you try that assassin hydra on Yi?
[7:49:09] ghosterath: the stats it gives are great. just not the stacking part

[7:54:48] ghosterath: @Hiyasu_Gaming hex sucks imo

[8:00:56] victheonegai123: @ghosterath like i think yi is weaker
[8:00:59] asiloiul: how yi do this sezon?
[8:01:01] victheonegai123: so broken
[8:01:21] ghosterath: @ghosterath how tho? i main yi also, and i think he is same as last season. no real difference
[8:01:40] victheonegai123: yea right
[8:01:50] Fingerllling: Are porofessor timers fixed?

[8:02:43] victheonegai123: yea need to balance
