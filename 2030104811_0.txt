[0:01:13] ubtcoinflip: First KEKW
[0:02:58] SherbLemon: Hey Medic, hope you are well
[0:03:01] ubtcoinflip: Yeah slow morning for me, just doing some lesson prep and chillin'
[0:03:06] ubtcoinflip: Play on the Main!!!!!
[0:03:18] little__barbie: good morning
[0:03:25] swoopske: Morning, so you've stopped playing with your Ashe?
[0:03:27] little__barbie: how are you today?
[0:03:29] ubtcoinflip: lovely, those are the best mornings
[0:04:10] ubtcoinflip: monkaS
[0:04:24] little__barbie: finally lec will return
[0:04:31] ubtcoinflip: im so hyped for LEC i cant wait man
[0:05:06] Broxah: Medic stream Pog
[0:05:50] ubtcoinflip: Nono, Rakan isn't strong at all he might even need some buffs at this point, i think if his Q did like 200 more base healing that'd be fine
[0:06:05] iCuriosity: Senna seems absolutely ridiculous
[0:06:20] Darkexcal: Naut?
[0:06:21] ubtcoinflip: His passive shield should also give a %dmg reduction like crown once the shield is popped i think
[0:06:32] ubtcoinflip: Blitzcrank and Bard are crazy too
[0:06:35] iCuriosity: You dont see the Windows? But WE WINDOWS
[0:06:42] ubtcoinflip: Or Nauti/Leona with the Sheen Supp item
[0:07:02] PROPER_: renata perf
[0:07:04] iCuriosity: Might aswell Slap an Experimental hexplate on naut, thatd be pretty funny
[0:07:04] ubtcoinflip: Maybe taric angle
[0:07:05] ubtcoinflip: or renata
[0:07:07] Jumptixx: sona
[0:07:08] PROPER_: strong vs engage
[0:07:28] Broxah: We like Renata here!
[0:07:42] PROPER_: o7
[0:07:44] iCuriosity: May i request for you to play La Ilusion Renata? Skin is gorgeous
[0:08:22] iCuriosity: Mucho appreciated
[0:08:38] ubtcoinflip: @Broxah Yooo broxah, did you end up achieving challenger as you wanted?
[0:08:55] swoopske: in terms of your professional growth, is casting in LEC more or less stressful as, let's say, 3 years ago? Cause you're always smurfing you know
[0:08:57] ubtcoinflip: i barely ended the season on GM, the cutoff was really closing in on me at the end lol
[0:09:17] Broxah: Broxah wasn't successful. We can't all be as clean as Medic..
[0:09:41] ubtcoinflip: Damn that sucks, now i regret how many times i ran you down accidentally
[0:10:08] hdktrey: do you still keep up with medicial knowledge every day
[0:10:25] ubtcoinflip: I still remember one of your first casts in LCS with the Mysterious Monkeys and you had a "Zoo" line that i loved
[0:10:29] SafetySocks: Morning!
[0:10:59] thepiwi98: hey medic, who is in your opinion, the smartest player in LEC?
[0:11:02] 2gooden: Good morning my man. Enjoyed the stream yesterday so I thought I‚Äôd return today! good luck for placements
[0:11:29] HeckMayster: guten morgen best of luck
[0:11:46] elKmino: broxahHey broxahHey
[0:12:02] roars59: GG üòÄ Happy ‚ù§Ô∏èWarmUpüíô Vinter‚ú®Ô∏èüéàStream üéà‚ú®Ô∏èEnjoy üòç
[0:12:15] ubtcoinflip: Are you starting locket or Shurelyas here?
[0:12:23] lec_airport_speedrun: PogO
[0:12:43] iCuriosity: Wait i thought they removed locket?
[0:12:58] ubtcoinflip: Agreed, 2nd item is kinda weird though here
[0:13:12] ubtcoinflip: Zoning Q
[0:13:51] Jeremy_The_Bear: Feels like leona and nilah are out of sync
[0:14:00] Jeremy_The_Bear: engaging one by one rather than together
[0:16:00] Phoen1xChan: Some of these new items are kinda insane man
[0:16:05] jonhopkinz420: LEOINA
[0:16:21] Phoen1xChan: Stormsurge is so much fun, when you make people pop
[0:16:38] DrakosCasts: damn this matchup looks free
[0:16:41] Hoang_X: is there an ideal way to use the new stacks when playing ranged sp vs melee sp?
[0:17:13] neurobrick: Is the LEC on 14.1?
[0:17:19] ubtcoinflip: @Hoang_X Poke dmg gives more gold than sharing mins, so focus on that
[0:17:41] DrakosCasts: @Hoang_X @Hoang_X if you ignore using stacks to push. For gold as melee you should always be sitting on two stacks for trades and then using your third stack whenever it is available on a creep. Ranged champs should just use stacks asap on enemy champs
[0:18:26] ubtcoinflip: @DrakosCasts Depends honestly, you wanna use up all of your stacks before you roam/reset anyways, bc the CD timer is so low now
[0:18:29] Darkexcal: Feels like unless going for a lush you can stack on casters as melee too with it being a flat 20 gold?
[0:18:41] Bilalligator: alowo
[0:18:41] Phoen1xChan: @DrakosCasts Is it as free as G2 vs MSF? Kappa
[0:18:43] Darkexcal: Push*
[0:18:49] Imwinston1: great Q
[0:19:59] DrakosCasts: @ubtcoinflip The basic idea is as long as you are never capped on stacks you aren't losing value. And that trading is better for gold than hitting minions. When you take push into account it gets more complicated but from a pure min-max standpoint all that matters is getting as many stacks off trading as possible and not wasting stack regen
[0:21:14] MaraudingBacon: thank god. a decent league streamer online. not more rage children
[0:21:30] neurobrick: @DrakosCasts so you can use stacks when you hit enemy champions?
[0:21:46] neurobrick: Oh I just saw a stack go down
[0:22:06] neurobrick: But you don't get full value out of cannons
[0:22:30] ubtcoinflip: @DrakosCasts I agree, but sitting on 2 stacks is kind of a gamble, bc if you get zoned off the wave in tough matchups/by being ganked you lose out on value bc you tried to min-max. I've found that trying so hard to min-max it makes you somewhat lose perspective on the game/best play for gamestate bc you're looking for the best play to min-max instead
[0:22:47] DrakosCasts: @neurobrick you can execute minions or hit enemy champs. ranged and melee passive got combined
[0:23:12] Hoang_X: disengage is crazy lol
[0:23:21] PowrOfFriendship_: Morning, Medici
[0:23:49] Hoang_X: what item do you go now that theres no radiant?
[0:24:02] PowrOfFriendship_: Renata with Sera? Does that work? I only play her with adcs
[0:24:04] linkinMCR: I honestly think melee Champs should get more gold from getting minions. It feels so miserable playing a melee supp rn
[0:24:04] silveRooRoo: its just nilah xp
[0:24:33] crispytain: why is seraphs first a thing now????
[0:24:47] ubtcoinflip: @ubtcoinflip I've had games on red side where i've been zoned off the wave by junglers & engage supps for more than 45 secs, because redside lane is so accessible, and if you keep your stacks maxed out in situations like that you end up losing a lot of value. Obviously still very situational, but
[0:24:56] crispytain: slayyy
[0:25:31] ubtcoinflip: dreammaker seems so good though
[0:26:11] Blue_Zozu: oh i didn't know you could sell it
[0:26:13] Blue_Zozu: that's nice
[0:27:43] hitsujikoujou: You actually hit nilah after missing leona but didnt q2
[0:28:03] ubtcoinflip: Lies
[0:28:13] hitsujikoujou: You are perfect stop lying
[0:28:31] ubtcoinflip: You may not be perfect but you only have to be (K)enough
[0:28:32] silveRooRoo: do you think there's a chance high elo will play ad+supp toplane for early grub pressure?
[0:29:11] silveRooRoo: + toplane is safer than bot now
[0:29:25] neurobrick: I think they would play AD + supp botlane and move supp top so it would be a 1v1 botlane adc vs adc
[0:29:41] hitsujikoujou: one of those two items are ridiculously expensive too.
[0:29:45] ubtcoinflip: I mean i definitely see an argument for redside doing so, as botlane on redside feels so horrible rn so you might aswell put a low resource tank in there, and farm your hypercarry up in top
[0:30:08] neurobrick: Yeah playing adc redside feels so awful
[0:30:24] silveRooRoo: i wouldnt be surprised to see both teams swapping
[0:30:58] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a ‚Ç¨500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[0:31:01] hitsujikoujou: Im really excited for the beginning of proplay with the new changes
[0:31:36] LeastToxicEgirl: hows the new map treating u mr medication
[0:31:42] Phoen1xChan: Is there anything new about TSM? Wasnt their plan to go to another major region?
[0:31:53] Darkexcal: Warding feels a lot different with the map changes, feels some places don't give you full vision in a brush etc
[0:32:15] silveRooRoo: the placement of clash flags is bugging me :D
[0:32:20] hitsujikoujou: You can hug the wall and war at max range for full brush vision
[0:32:28] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[0:32:36] linkinMCR: What are you're thoughts on ranged VS melee supp? Imo melee supp feel so awful due to the changes and should get more gold from taking minions as you are so unlikely to get the 30g from dealing dmg to Champs
[0:33:02] DrakosCasts: @ubtcoinflip Yeah I definitely am not applying any context or nuance past range vs melee, im just saying whats optimal on paper.
[0:33:28] Jeremy_The_Bear: waiting for his moment, maybe?
[0:33:58] StreamElements: Want to stay up to date with all things Team BDS? You can find all their socials over here: https://linktr.ee/TeamBDS medicNoted
[0:34:41] hitsujikoujou: I receive one Fiora, you receive ocean soul 4Head
[0:35:10] ubtcoinflip: @DrakosCasts Fair enough, i often feel like with these generalized rules people seem to focus on those and stop thinking about the game for themselves
[0:35:17] LeastToxicEgirl: how have u been streaming so long its like 10:30
[0:35:22] ubtcoinflip: Man your sera is on fire
[0:35:34] ubtcoinflip: always go for the coinflip
[0:35:58] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[0:36:02] hitsujikoujou: Its good time for aussies
[0:36:27] hannahofstadter: too busy reading to start stream KEKWiggle
[0:36:41] LeastToxicEgirl: good time for me too i just got dressed and i have nothing to do
[0:36:47] LeastToxicEgirl: except play lies o p
[0:36:47] PowrOfFriendship_: It's probably a Twitch bug, but the client said you'd been streaming for 25 hours straight for me
[0:36:59] LeastToxicEgirl: smut is smut and you should own it
[0:37:00] ubtcoinflip: Yikes, i just got hit with a 1 minute ad right ingame
[0:37:02] Bilalligator: medic just telling all of chat that hes been super horny for 2 days
[0:37:13] sanguisluxx: Which book did you read?
[0:37:18] Darkexcal: Seraphines spacing was great there
[0:37:21] silveRooRoo: that was a really good ult
[0:37:43] hitsujikoujou: xdd
[0:37:48] sanguisluxx: I love ACOTAR erickdLove
[0:37:51] LeastToxicEgirl: whos ur boss? like a rioter?
[0:37:52] monster411223: what game you gonna cast ?
[0:38:11] SirGurd991: is that brandon sanderson?
[0:38:14] hannahofstadter: as if i didnt make you read it
[0:38:20] LeastToxicEgirl: no i meant like her designation kinda bc idk how bheind the scenes works in lec
[0:38:34] SirGurd991: Or who is the author
[0:38:46] sanguisluxx: Sarah J. Maas @sirgurd991
[0:38:47] LeastToxicEgirl: OKAY SEJUANI  DRIFTING
[0:39:07] Bilalligator: sej ankles were broken af
[0:39:11] LeastToxicEgirl: she drifted too far away....
[0:39:11] Phoen1xChan: Would you ever consider taking a more background work, rather than being an on air talent. Something along the lines of talent scouting, or being a GM?
[0:39:30] hitsujikoujou: I've been happier with chat off, if only to not know that my team is mental booming.
[0:40:28] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:41:04] LeastToxicEgirl: what regions besides lec do you have most fun watching?
[0:41:06] Phoen1xChan: You seem like a patient man, I think you would make a great Singed top coach OneHand
[0:41:14] LeastToxicEgirl: @Phoen1xChan KEKW
[0:41:25] LeastToxicEgirl: dont say that.......
[0:41:25] Darkexcal: What's you predictions for first drafts this season?
[0:41:30] LeastToxicEgirl: dont say 56.......
[0:41:34] silveRooRoo: @Phoen1xChan noone can compete with how Kuba is though
[0:41:41] LeastToxicEgirl: i cant take it so early in the morning
[0:41:44] Kideffex: im still cracking up at watching all the belveth clips this patch
[0:41:47] pedroharoz: Im gettin bad vibes at bot lane I only see caitlyn, jhin and vayne bot
[0:41:49] ubtcoinflip: Blitz is crazy good honestly
[0:41:57] ubtcoinflip: i think blitz might also be prio
[0:41:57] Sethur: BelVeth?
[0:42:00] LeastToxicEgirl: do you think hwei is actually op? i feel like hes not as hypercarry as some other mages
[0:42:01] Phoen1xChan: Zoe mid is a banger
[0:42:03] Silfel: Rumble? PauseChamp
[0:42:20] LeastToxicEgirl: god rumble jax meta i quit at the right time
[0:42:41] hitsujikoujou: Im predicting Lulu mid, not even trolling it's busted
[0:42:46] LeastToxicEgirl: wow assassins mid? lider licking his lips atm
[0:43:05] Vrunes: talon looks busted tbh
[0:43:07] Phoen1xChan: Lider is a scary man when he gets rolling on his picks
[0:43:10] Rejamela: do we already know when the new cute dragon champ is coming?
[0:43:18] Rejamela: also: good morning
[0:43:28] bambieuw: gg btw :)
[0:43:40] Rejamela: yes!
[0:43:40] bambieuw: relized i was playing with u after the game xd
[0:43:42] Phoen1xChan: @Rejamela next patch or the patch after? I think
[0:43:50] Rejamela: thank you Phoen1xChan
[0:43:53] LeastToxicEgirl: whos GIGASHY in ur friend list
[0:43:55] bambieuw: yee that was me griefing ngl on that first death
[0:44:05] linkinMCR: Is jungle your second best role?
[0:44:07] LeastToxicEgirl: based hysterics tbh
[0:44:22] bambieuw: ye ye ye it was like turbo int ngl haha, everything before that was perfect wave managment and then i did that
[0:44:57] Bilalligator: couple of people in the chat were saying the sera is playing really well
[0:45:22] bambieuw: @Bilalligator ait my ego getting inflated xd
[0:45:29] Bilalligator: xdd
[0:45:43] bambieuw: i had flash
[0:46:25] ubtcoinflip: Rakan angle
[0:46:28] Phoen1xChan: Imagine if all LoL players was as patient as Medic.... Fuck the game would be amazing
[0:46:30] sim4ecav2: Luci+ Braum ?
[0:46:36] ubtcoinflip: Well thats on you
[0:46:47] ubtcoinflip: Mao angle
[0:46:50] ubtcoinflip: Mao/Blitz
[0:46:52] blubbubb: go Milio, who cares
[0:46:54] Phoen1xChan: Singed angle? Kappa
[0:47:04] ubtcoinflip: maybe blitz, sylas is good vs mao
[0:47:09] ubtcoinflip: but still mao is always good
[0:47:12] Bilalligator: tank mao support has been destroying my games this season
[0:47:15] bambieuw: but ye im getting into next game gg cya in soloq :)
[0:47:15] Phoen1xChan: Oh yeah, Sylas is also strong
[0:47:18] blubbubb: hairy?
[0:47:41] Ixdex1: giving sylas mao ult would have been kinda bad, no?
[0:48:04] Jeremy_The_Bear: geeze that enemy team looks menacing
[0:48:08] linkinMCR: Ngl I think bone plating is kinda troll on supp
[0:49:22] linkinMCR: Or jhin Autos you once and bone plating does nothing
[0:49:26] Phoen1xChan: Eve isnt
[0:49:28] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[0:49:41] hitsujikoujou: I dont disagree, but if you get q e'd doesnt bone plating expire before the stun ends?
[0:49:42] Phoen1xChan: Eve is too busy looking at the Nida splashart
[0:49:57] Bilalligator: i was literally just typing theres no way thats not warded
[0:49:58] embryage: @MedicCasts hello there
[0:50:00] Jeremy_The_Bear: oof
[0:50:07] hitsujikoujou: Still 60 reduction which more than justifies it
[0:50:15] Breedlove00: inting a minute in
[0:50:16] Breedlove00: gg
[0:50:30] Phoen1xChan: I mean.... Im Gold at the moment and I wouldnt do something as bad
[0:50:31] neurobrick: is lucian milio the next big botlane
[0:50:35] swoopske: definition of insanity, trying the same thing and expecting different result
[0:50:40] embryage: yep this is over
[0:50:42] swoopske: she could steal their red
[0:50:45] crispytain: surely she gets banned Aware
[0:50:50] embryage: just call it
[0:50:59] Jeremy_The_Bear: gawd so infuriating
[0:51:10] hitsujikoujou: getting banned at the beginning of season
[0:51:25] Bilalligator: this is how all my placements went yesterday
[0:51:33] embryage: this is how my placement too
[0:51:38] embryage: total disaster
[0:51:38] Bilalligator: game was decided in 5 mins without any impact from me
[0:51:39] linkinMCR: Dw she's doing the peanut tactic
[0:51:41] DeviantC: yeah placements master elo is so weird i went 1-4 into emerald 1
[0:52:03] hitsujikoujou: probably compensation plays
[0:52:33] embryage: yep this is exact how bad is early split 1
[0:52:41] embryage: i can't do shit
[0:52:46] embryage: as jungler
[0:52:49] Bilalligator: really annoying as well because i was placed only one rank below where i finished previous season and gained 0 LP from placements
[0:52:54] embryage: when you see 3 lanes lose
[0:53:06] Bilalligator: if i won all 5 i could have probably got most of the way to plat
[0:53:09] DiveIntoMist: why is that if u ping a zombie ward, u get 5 gold, but when u hit that ward - u get 1 gold only?
[0:53:26] DiveIntoMist: aaaah, thanks!
[0:53:40] swoopske: you know, invading and beating Eve into the ground is the best way to win against her
[0:53:44] linkinMCR: Zombie wards only give 1 gold
[0:53:46] Phoen1xChan: The irony of what Eve said
[0:54:02] swoopske: true dat
[0:54:13] SlitheryPotato: chat random question but when a season starts you do check patch notes right to see what's new before jumping in ranked Q right??
[0:54:20] Bilalligator: she got bronze cheesed in fucking plat
[0:54:26] Bilalligator: 3 times
[0:54:53] Phoen1xChan: Look! Its an easy win
[0:55:23] hitsujikoujou: 0/7 is better than 0/5 I think, charges bounties more than it gives gold
[0:55:27] Bilalligator: this pyke is the luckiest player EUW
[0:55:34] Phoen1xChan: I think focusing on getting Lucian fed is the best play
[0:55:40] Phoen1xChan: And then try and peel
[0:55:49] linkinMCR: It's the peanut strat im telling you. Remember summer playoffs GenG vs DK?
[0:56:34] Jeremy_The_Bear: that surely was intentional
[0:57:29] embryage: i mean every regional has bad player so yeah
[0:57:32] embryage: even SEA has it
[0:57:33] AbigailxCake: KonCha Hi
[0:57:40] embryage: stupidity beyond comprehension
[0:58:00] SlitheryPotato: so my jgler last game decided to invide instead of taking grubs fight in enemy jgl till they despawned then asked has herald changed
[0:58:21] embryage: @SlitheryPotato classic league reading comprehension, as per

[0:59:49] embryage: yeah it's 6
[0:59:54] Blue_Zozu: yeah you dont see it on the enemy
[0:59:56] SlitheryPotato: @SlitheryPotato hehe i just calmly advised him to go read patch notes after the game that we won only bc the enemy jgler was a teemo camping top
[0:59:58] Blue_Zozu: but you can tab and check
[1:00:22] Bilalligator: how do you see it on tab?
[1:00:31] embryage: @SlitheryPotato good i hope that jungler read it, slowly
[1:00:33] Phoen1xChan: Lucian is strong though
[1:00:58] StreamElements: Please sub, it costs a lot to have hair this good and a fashion sense.
[1:01:00] Tayjan: @linkinMCR Eventually those of us hardstuck bronze experience ego death and that can be quite satisfying no longer caring
[1:01:02] neurobrick: I think Lucian is the strongest adc in the patch
[1:01:30] Phoen1xChan: Nah, I'd say their skill level is beneath you
[1:01:34] Silfel: You have a solid chance NODDERS
[1:01:40] Jeremy_The_Bear: dream
[1:01:45] Phoen1xChan: If it wasnt for Eve, and them having being fed, it'd be the easiest win
[1:01:51] SlitheryPotato: @SlitheryPotato btw here goes something to punder Karma full AP mid Can one shot like an assassin late game
[1:01:58] Bilalligator: shes not even clearing
[1:02:27] Silfel: COPIUM
[1:02:28] Jeremy_The_Bear: Eve is still actively sabotaging your tea, sadly
[1:02:34] Jeremy_The_Bear: team lol
[1:02:47] neurobrick: Yeah the team is actually doing well other than eve
[1:02:50] Silfel: Not the tea D:
[1:02:53] Phoen1xChan: Talk about the Lucian
[1:02:55] linkinMCR: Thoughts on Camille supp?
[1:02:59] AbigailxCake: Just play PrideUwu
[1:03:00] embryage: @MedicCasts you have patience of saint.
[1:03:31] Phoen1xChan: I mean, this lucian put on his dancing shoes man
[1:03:41] SlitheryPotato: @linkinMCR i mean that might be on the same premise has lissadra supp right?
[1:03:49] pedroharoz: I've been playing a lot better after muting everyone in the start of the game

[1:04:17] neurobrick: What about Flowing Water
[1:04:21] neurobrick: for the CD for lucian
[1:04:35] Silfel: Ziggs damage danWow
[1:04:41] LUCYXZ1337: sup chat yall hot
[1:04:50] embryage: Jax being Jax
[1:04:54] Bilalligator: you know what else is big?
[1:05:09] embryage: and Uncle Phreak going to buff W and R on Jax for turrets
[1:05:19] embryage: have you seen the proposed changes in 14.2?
[1:05:23] neurobrick: your Qs are on point this game
[1:05:30] Phoen1xChan: Did you guys see the TF changes? POGGERS
[1:05:45] Squallly: good morning Medic, good morning chat! ^^
[1:05:52] linkinMCR: Do you like the changes on 14.1?
[1:05:57] Phoen1xChan: Hi @Squallly POGGERS
[1:05:58] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[1:05:58] Silfel: Triforce or Twisted Fate? rooThink
[1:06:05] embryage: Stormsurge 1st, good Lord
[1:06:09] WilliamHS: POGGERS
[1:06:11] Phoen1xChan: @Silfel Twisted Fate
[1:06:17] hitsujikoujou: big bounty
[1:06:25] Silfel: Nope rooThink
[1:06:33] SlitheryPotato: 3 for 2 not bad
[1:06:33] PatTheSilent: split pushing ziggs Pog
[1:06:40] hitsujikoujou: Those accidental charges feel like a design issue more than anything.
[1:06:40] Squallly: @Phoen1xChan Hey Phoen1xChan!  How's it going?
[1:06:40] Bilalligator: it is bad because its super hard to proc the passive
[1:06:46] Bilalligator: stormsurge second is the way
[1:06:50] blubbubb: I think people are gonna try to ride the herald to another lane after it crashed one turret
[1:06:53] Phoen1xChan: @Silfel They are making AD TF viable, making him get more gold on Crits
[1:06:57] blubbubb: seen that already being done
[1:07:08] Phoen1xChan: @Squallly I havent slept ResidentSleeper how are you?
[1:07:15] Silfel: @Phoen1xChan danWow I don't play it, but I like it if they support variety
[1:07:21] hannahofstadter: Bowl without salmon/chicken today? hannah67Lurk
[1:07:29] Bilalligator: maybe just akali eve can rush it but i think it only procs with ult
[1:07:37] Phoen1xChan: @Silfel I like TF sometimes
[1:07:46] Squallly: @Phoen1xChan Pretty good, thanks!  But have a few too many things to do for a Friday!
[1:07:48] WilliamHS: Gun them down
[1:07:51] Phoen1xChan: Duuude, this Lucian is awesome
[1:08:20] neurobrick: 10 death powerspile
[1:08:31] Phoen1xChan: @Squallly Hey, get them over with, and you can chill in the weekend I hope
[1:09:35] neurobrick: overzealous
[1:09:42] Bilalligator: lucy flashing forward was not the play
[1:09:42] Phoen1xChan: Too deep
[1:09:55] Phoen1xChan: He also admits it calmly
[1:09:59] Jeremy_The_Bear: jhin did like 1,2k dmg in one second
[1:10:00] neurobrick: the ziggs damage is nice
[1:10:04] Bilalligator: theres too much pressure on him to carry so he had to try super hard
[1:10:12] Squallly: @Phoen1xChan yeah, i've got a client meeting mid-afternoon, but hopefully can get everything else done before then (probably being too hopeful, but good to have good intentions :p)
[1:10:28] Silfel: I also didn't quite expect the Jhin oneshot and I guess neither did Lucian
[1:10:28] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:10:58] Silfel: Jhin got the kill. Dunno who did the damage tho rooThink
[1:11:03] Phoen1xChan: @Squallly You got this mate! :D
[1:11:52] lsiebenschlaferl: what are the flames you are collecting in the jungle? Does Milio collect souls now?
[1:12:11] Phoen1xChan: Eve can play when she tries! NICE!
[1:12:25] hitsujikoujou: Honestly, as a Qiyana main, I prefer this way
[1:12:28] Silfel: That's not exclusive to anyone to be clear
[1:12:47] lsiebenschlaferl: Interesting, thanks for the great explanation
[1:12:49] hitsujikoujou: It sucked for the game to have a 1/5 chance to gimp my entire kit.
[1:13:34] Phoen1xChan: Lucian survived though
[1:13:54] Silfel: no1NOOO he died
[1:13:55] Phoen1xChan: I retract my statement
[1:14:16] MaraudingBacon: @hitsujikoujou that patch where infernal cucked rengar was some of the funniest league i have had in a while
[1:14:41] Jazzgar: emotional support cat
[1:14:42] Phoen1xChan: That game was so free
[1:14:43] Jumptixx: can you show us your tattoo?
[1:14:56] Sjobbe: !tattoo
[1:14:57] StreamElements: Medic has 2 tattoos. One on his chest : https://twitter.com/MedicCasts/status/976504976846524417 and one on his back and right arm: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts/status/1426613850552639497

[1:15:44] Rejamela: yay! bestest Squallly medicLove
[1:15:52] Phoen1xChan: Look at Lucians damage
[1:16:00] Phoen1xChan: He did the most in the game
[1:16:11] neurobrick: lucian tried his best to
[1:17:00] Phoen1xChan: A second? I'd need a whole year LUL
[1:17:28] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[1:17:49] TeamBDS: Did we buy into the Ardent first meta on Milio? modCheck
[1:19:29] hitsujikoujou: Maybe that was the intent from the start?
[1:19:30] Sintemon: unlucky game medic, was the lucian
[1:20:49] Sintemon: nono
[1:20:51] Sintemon: topside
[1:20:57] Sintemon: was completely mb
[1:21:00] Sintemon: that was int
[1:21:01] Sintemon: xd
[1:21:09] Rejamela: unlike me, I can teach you all to make a ton of mistakes KEKW
[1:21:35] Isak_Solberg: good vibes in botlane, what is this?
[1:21:36] Phoen1xChan: @Sintemon You were amazing that game, dont let that Eve get you down
[1:21:37] atomiclawyer: whats better on lucian rn krakenslayer or the new item ?
[1:21:46] Silfel: You did real well, Sintemon. Nothing you could do Sadge
[1:22:11] Isak_Solberg: got any tips on Lucian, @Sintemon ? i struggle to use him efficiently
[1:22:33] Silfel: Rengar otps DansGame
[1:22:45] Sintemon: I think kraken navori is just best rn
[1:22:54] Sintemon: essence is getting buffed next patch
[1:22:57] Sintemon: might be good then
[1:22:58] Sintemon: idk
[1:23:24] Jazzgar: no, you always gotta cook with all the spices
[1:23:37] Squallly:  Let's gamba: will Medic win the game?!
[1:23:51] Sintemon: @Isak_Solberg hmm I think most people make the mistake of dashing in first, hold your dash as long as you can start trades with W if possible
[1:24:09] Isak_Solberg: i am guilty of that lol
[1:24:14] Squallly: @Rejamela, gamba up for you medicHeart

[1:26:55] l0tus666: can hwei be played on LEC this week?
[1:26:59] Jeremy_The_Bear: hwei support? That a thing?
[1:27:23] DrBiscotti: even riot consider him a support
[1:28:49] hitsujikoujou: Which matchups do you prefer q start over w?
[1:28:52] Rejamela: @Squallly damn it! I was brain afk
[1:29:12] Squallly: medicCry
[1:29:17] Rejamela: let's act as if I would've invested my points there, of course for the win!
[1:29:25] HolyLacri: Ashe with Cull in this lane should be free no?
[1:30:06] hannahofstadter: @Squallly it was my fault. I was distracting @Rejamela
[1:30:06] l0tus666: hwei has a built in mana sustain right?
[1:30:14] Jeremy_The_Bear: yes he does
[1:30:33] Squallly: hiya Hanna!  how are you doing?  hope you have a great weekend~
[1:30:58] StreamElements: Oh yes, please give me subby wubbies, feels yummy in my tummy.

[1:35:01] Darkexcal: Noct with hexplate is so busted atm
[1:35:03] red_heiho: I feel so bad when I screw over my sup.. some people play like what's they're for
[1:35:43] Kwantuum: EUW moment

[1:36:15] narnsberg: No preseason seems to have stomped everyone's mental
[1:37:27] Sylvain269: This season is sooo much better man
[1:38:00] Sylvain269: New items are great, there's a ton of item diversity. Map changes are generally better for vision and ganking
[1:38:36] Sylvain269: Void Grubs are sooo easy to take early game
[1:38:44] Sylvain269: Actually enjoying League for once
[1:39:14] Jeremy_The_Bear: malphite wants to be the hero or he just wants to quit
[1:39:22] Sylvain269: As a support, what do you think of the new map changes?
[1:39:26] Darkexcal: @sylvain269 I like the grubs, feels like midlaners can take them easy enough too if they have a solid oush
[1:39:32] Sylvain269: @Darkexcal Yep
[1:40:17] Sylvain269: I think League right now is entirely a player problem now
[1:40:28] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:40:38] Sylvain269: People are just bad at the game and AFK, grief, or play poorly
[1:40:46] Sylvain269: The game is very well balanced now
[1:40:52] HystericsCasts: Ive come in to the biggest sigh I've heard this year
[1:40:57] HystericsCasts: things must be going well
[1:41:19] HystericsCasts: what is that nocturne doing kek

[1:46:55] itstotallyamber: Nick <3
[1:47:09] bambieuw: ye ye ofc
[1:47:20] WintersWard: but like way worse than that
[1:47:35] bambieuw: i mean ofc i would back off since i see i die in that position, soo i think best case for you is both stay low hp
[1:47:42] bambieuw: then noc comes and i lose wave
[1:48:04] bambieuw: either case thats good for you cuz noc bot and im deppresed
[1:49:12] hitsujikoujou: maybe autofilled?
[1:49:41] bambieuw: hwei autofilled

[1:50:05] ItsVausey: i think thats on u

[1:50:52] TeamBDS: Not the puns
[1:50:58] TeamBDS: Smadge
[1:50:59] hitsujikoujou: She q-ed the minion aswell so she couldnt trade back
[1:51:03] ItsVausey: she didnt have to be there but ur job as supp is just to be there for cover i dno
[1:51:03] Phoen1xChan: Puns give me life.
[1:51:07] hitsujikoujou: thats q on the caster
[1:51:17] itstotallyamber: Phoenix AYAYA
[1:51:26] Phoen1xChan: Amber! POGGERS
[1:51:43] ItsStiwn: same job as jgl tbh
[1:52:12] fanzrl: no matter if you should have stayed with her or not. mf could have q'd the cannon and played it safer since you left
[1:52:16] Darkexcal: Support isn't a babysitter which it feels like some adcs don't realise that
[1:53:05] koponenjn: Ulting while standing in fire :(
[1:54:07] hitsujikoujou: Exactly!
[1:54:09] Tentacula: Ohh it's a content angle
[1:54:15] blubbubb: sometimes you just aren't on the same page as the adc, it happens, can't do much about it
[1:54:15] mrsandman_dm: General thoughts on the forced Vanguard after February? Wouldn't be worried about it but I am a little after seeing what happened to some Valorant player's PCs
[1:54:32] blubbubb: but good that you're focusing on what to improve on on your end
[1:54:49] itstotallyamber: @mrsandman_dm People just have trauma from when Vanguard was first introduced to Valo
[1:54:59] Sylvain269: @mrsandman_dm Best case scenario you can sue Riot
[1:55:12] itstotallyamber: Think it's being blown slightly out of proportion
[1:55:28] mrsandman_dm: @sylvain269 pretty sure that didn't work when they wanted compensation for their bricked parts
[1:55:52] ggiga__: i think its odd they added such an extreme, kernel level anticheat after basically shrugging off cheating issues for such a long time
[1:55:57] ggiga__: very 0-100
[1:56:06] mrsandman_dm: I'm aware it's likely a very small portion of people it happened to, just a worry that it happened at all, and with a program that runs 24/7 even without the game running.
[1:56:08] blubbubb: better late than never though, no?
[1:56:17] Phoen1xChan: @ggiga__ that because of the recent hack
[1:57:13] Igneas15: It has bricked people PCs in the past too
[1:57:22] itstotallyamber: The key words there are, in the past
[1:57:23] mrsandman_dm: I mean, I've heard it works SOMEWHAT for Valorant, that it still happens, but the more concerning part is the fact that it has been used to brick PCs in the past (not the program itself but people abusing the program to do so)
[1:57:32] hitsujikoujou: It has bricked pcs that had software control for fans. (broke by overheating)
[1:57:46] TeamBDS: So what is everyones prediction for the first match on Saturday :)
[1:57:50] Tentacula: The Vanguard discussion is so diluted.. The positives are obviously there and the "average case" is an improvement. It's the worst case that gets worse, which is human error on the dev side.
[1:57:55] lec_airport_speedrun: Who the fuck are G2
[1:58:00] TeamBDS: (there is only 1 correct answer)
[1:58:00] lec_airport_speedrun: Ice 1v9
[1:58:04] itstotallyamber: Hello Lamp <3
[1:58:06] TeamBDS: @lec_airport_speedrun BASED
[1:58:09] lec_airport_speedrun: medicHi_SG

[1:58:16] TeamBDS: @ubtcoinflip D:
[1:58:19] itstotallyamber: Coinflip AYAYA
[1:58:30] gabraxfangirl69kmwtw: I mean there are various types of cheats, some even work on another embedded device so that the PC does not see that the memory used by the game is being looked into by some other software
[1:58:45] ubtcoinflip: @TeamBDS jkjk, my hate for g2 is bigger than any other emotion i feel for a lec team, #bdswin
[1:58:53] ubtcoinflip: @itstotallyamber Amber AYAYA
[1:58:58] Phoen1xChan: @TeamBDS What happens if BDS has a perfect game against G2? I mean, they beat T1, so does that mean BDS are the new champs? Kappa
[1:59:05] Tentacula: I'm a bit worried because Riot is not like... *known* for their data security lol
[1:59:14] mrsandman_dm: My problem is Riot not only not looking into those cases, but also shutting down any discussion on the main reddit. It doesn't inspire confidence for if problems show up in the future.
[1:59:16] TeamBDS: @Phoen1xChan yes thats how it works
[1:59:27] ggiga__: people suggested having a requirement for vanguard in something like plat and above which obviously riot would never do but it would at least spare the majority of players in low elo, who rarely deal w these issues
[1:59:32] hannahofstadter: a bit heavy on the garlic this time Hmm
[1:59:43] lec_airport_speedrun: Wigius medicHi_SG
[1:59:46] itstotallyamber: Hanna KPOPlove
[1:59:48] siggirave: medic are you casting tomorrow?
[1:59:50] Tentacula: Once I forgot my Trackmania password the some actual support person mailed it back to me in plain text LMAO
[1:59:51] Phoen1xChan: @TeamBDS Im a G2 fan though, but I want an entertaining game first and foremost.
[1:59:54] Tentacula: *and
[1:59:58] ubtcoinflip: @mrsandman_dm Is riot shutting down these discussions or are mod closing the 20th thread on a topic that has been talked about for days without any new takes
[2:00:11] lec_airport_speedrun: Wait what, why are we blaming riot for the world's most useless mod team
[2:00:13] HystericsCasts: Pog Opening
[2:00:19] TeamBDS: Pog
[2:00:24] TeamBDS: Hello Hysterics

[2:00:56] ubtcoinflip: MF supp angle
[2:00:58] TeamBDS: SkinSpotlights evyySad
[2:00:58] StreamElements: If you sub I promise I won't not die in the next 5 minutes
[2:01:01] Sylvain269: What SKinSpotlights issue?
[2:01:09] Tentacula: Okay the skin thing is not one guy we are all watching it no
[2:01:12] blubbubb: man, I had to submit stuff for the DBS check and fuckin hell getting a document PRINTED is such a hassle nowadays if you don't own a printer
[2:01:13] hannahofstadter: @ElusiveFRZ well I have to go talk to people in a bit and they might have a diffrent opinion on it xD
[2:01:37] Sylvain269: Ahhh
[2:01:38] TeamBDS: Wait the observing stuff is from SkinSpotlight?
[2:01:39] itstotallyamber: SkinSpotlights got hard boned tbh
[2:01:40] TeamBDS: HUH
[2:01:45] itstotallyamber: For all they've done for them
[2:01:46] Phoen1xChan: Do casters need to have 'Casts' in their online name, when it comes to Twitter and Twitch, or is it just a unspoken rule?
[2:01:54] ElusiveFRZ: @hannahofstadter give them some garlic as well and then no problems
[2:01:58] ubtcoinflip: @Phoen1xChan Yes
[2:01:59] Tentacula: I'm more talking about the community benefits
[2:02:07] 8610sleeping: are u signed by team bds? not that i mind but arent there conflict of interests?
[2:02:17] Phoen1xChan: Makes sense
[2:02:24] hannahofstadter: @hannahofstadter i'll just bring some cucumber salad to the hairdressers xD
[2:02:26] ubtcoinflip: Nah but as someone who has had the joy of playing against Ezreal/Zeri every 2nd game im so looking forward to vanguard
[2:02:32] hitsujikoujou: 10 skins rich lobbyu
[2:02:32] lec_airport_speedrun: You heard him cast since summer? You can judge the conflict of interest for yourself
[2:02:38] Rejamela: do we bet again, @Squallly ? :D
[2:02:43] TeamBDS: U can caster curse...
[2:02:44] TeamBDS: Susge
[2:02:45] Rejamela: now I'm ready, I promise!
[2:02:47] blubbubb: well
[2:02:51] itstotallyamber: Rej UwU
[2:02:57] 8610sleeping: ah i see okok
[2:02:57] blubbubb: there's caster curse Kappa
[2:03:00] Tentacula: Queue medic shouting jungle timers so loud the teams can hear
[2:03:00] TeamBDS: Medic is not biased though
[2:03:01] Phoen1xChan: I think Sjokz is good enough on her own for cursing
[2:03:09] TeamBDS: He casts objectively GIGACHAD
[2:03:10] Silfel: Every caster has their favourites anyway
[2:03:14] ubtcoinflip: Medic's gonna hold a "It all starts with success" speech before every BDS Game
