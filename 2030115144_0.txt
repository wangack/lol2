[5:41:50] youthanasia11: Does wave MANAgement refer to the fact that in order to manage your wave properly you need to economize and administer your use of mana properly? Like you will never have full control of a wave if you run out of mana. I know it's a normal english word but they could've chosen something like "Wave administration" or "wave control", but they deliberately chose "MANAgement" which may imply that it more implicitly is talking about the wave as much as how you use your mana to manage it.
