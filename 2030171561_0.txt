[3:55:59] eyedriht: love this
[3:56:07] MrVilgot: you can overdose on anything
[3:56:21] hartlessvessl: The main consequence of vitamin D toxicity is a buildup of calcium in your blood (hypercalcemia), which can cause nausea and vomiting, weakness, and frequent urination. Vitamin D toxicity might progress to bone pain and kidney problems, such as the formation of calcium stones - i was right
[3:56:21] Lefty_22: Vitamin D is fat soluble, not water soluble, so you can* overdose on it.
[3:56:23] SaintRodent: addicted to D's is crazy

[4:52:32] katarina_gremory: where is that shield coming from?
[4:52:40] MaxenceJeuneLe: but then again, this whole discussion about toxic ego came from the topic of "Muscular guys". I've been to gym for 2 years now and imo muscular guys are very gentle.
[4:52:50] gertman: i built that on malphite its insane
[4:53:07] genio____: @MaxenceJeuneLe yeah that's the crazy thing: in my experience the guys who lift the heaviest are like the softest, nicest people ever
[4:53:13] bobbypoussi: You can have an ego and still be humble externally, using your ego internally to push yourself further

[6:21:26] Shuuyaa: no but items dont give as many mixed stats anymore
[6:21:27] bleus23: @Saishihouse not really
[6:21:33] Shuuyaa: just like before item rework
[6:21:34] Saishihouse: Ah
[6:21:38] Shuuyaa: so people have to actually know how to build
[6:21:38] curlythepube: i cant wiat to eat food and not be hungry for a while
[6:21:42] Saishihouse: guess everyone just buiding squishy KEKW

[6:22:57] Saishihouse: @curlythepube ? Shes been eating her boogers for 6 hours shes fine
[6:23:02] Shuuyaa: @Saishihouse yes all the dps items dont have hp anymore esspecially for ap champs
[6:23:14] bleus23: @bigdabrusher yes 50
[6:23:27] chillworm: all the worm haters out there dont know that Worms tunnel deeply in the soil and bring subsoil closer to the surface mixing it with the topsoil. Slime, a secretion of earthworms, contains nitrogen. Nitrogen is an important nutrient for plants.
[6:23:35] Shuuyaa: so you can go full burstmage now, but youll be 0 defensive stats
[6:23:37] sermoxie: no adc?

[6:25:02] amedben_001: hopemaxinnngg
[6:25:07] Hakke98: @nakamaxx no man
[6:25:08] chillworm: The sticky slime helps to hold clusters of soil particles together in formations called aggregates.
[6:25:22] Shuuyaa: @shoot3me00 titanic was never a ad burst item tho and ad itemization never really had this issue to begin with
[6:25:37] Shuuyaa: stat seperation was always quite good for ad assassins and bruisers
