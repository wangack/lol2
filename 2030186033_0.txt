[4:29:52] kozukikento: i thought stat check was champs like lee sin that have op base stats
[4:30:00] ElChUChYy: are u liking the new season so far @solarbacca ?
[4:30:15] knarFehTknaT: I see it more as ‘tryndamere with ad beats anyone else with the same amount of ad’
[4:30:18] KidKnievel: whats your favorite matchup? in terms of fun as apposed to easy win
[4:30:27] FrowstyWaffles: isn't stat checking when you drop your load on someone and then if they don't have the requisite stats to survive your combo, they die?
[4:30:29] CARDMASTER420XX: aftershock in toplane zac? ew
[4:30:34] cursedcomrade: @n1kkov_ think Garen, even if you shit on him and he is the worst garen player in the server, if he gets his combo on you and R's you, you die Stat check basically means, your abilities make you even if you are behind
[4:30:38] SabaHyrulean: Is bacca building bruiser cuz it's better than crit, or does he just think its fun?
[4:30:38] Nightbot: yes? no? idk
[4:30:39] knarFehTknaT: so he stat checks by checking how well other people USE the ad
[4:30:41] xXSuperCuberXx: if a fight is won or lost simply because someone has more items/stats and theres very little skill involved @solarbacca
[4:30:44] SabaHyrulean: Bacca for fun player?

[4:31:36] rothusk: zac top seems fun
[4:31:51] o_joyboy: from the googs: Stat check means the enemy beats you just by raw power of stats they have. Example: fighting darius level 1 nearly everyone loses because he just has so many stats for free with his bleed that you cannot walk up to take a fight with him early
[4:31:54] c2qiqi: not much counterplay once they get items?
