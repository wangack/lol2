[0:43:08] Falcnation: hwo does the buff distribution work? there can be like 3 blues on the same team
[0:43:37] nwa4lifeTV: if u want, steraks is fine
[0:43:42] OPDonQuixoteTFT: @santorin how about going tabis and steraks for tenacity
[0:43:55] Mavvrix: 30% armor and magic resistence after 5 secs
[0:44:14] Mavvrix: Need to ask yourself can you survive that long to get that buff
[0:44:18] Offsette7: im missing a lot of objetives with smite, so ez steal

[0:46:00] TheMossEnthusiast: maybe lethality jarvin is the play
[0:46:19] johaido12: pretty sure the sunderer item is bad on j4 it feels so useless
[0:46:27] johaido12: when i played it
[0:47:05] johaido12: ye thats why he sucks
[0:47:06] Falcnation: i think they tried to give more build paths but theyve been trying that for 5 seasons lol
[0:47:06] PineappleCoco: can you see how much sundered has done? hmm
[0:47:09] Mavvrix: Frozen Heart :)

[0:50:48] catlover12435: its so funny that gwen just built 3 mythics it just looks so wrong

[1:15:13] nwa4lifeTV: 💩
[1:15:17] thedubbleblue: i had a enemy cho SUPP with smite
[1:15:17] EdgedSilver: it's a dot that scales with each stack vs towers, then you get a ZZrot/belveth minion that spawns when you attack towers at 5 stacks (6stacks gives another)
[1:15:18] koushik_10: bro in low elo if i get ahead on belveth is like over there is not counter play
[1:15:20] Myst3420: Fecal diff?
[1:15:21] thedubbleblue: who was in my top jngl PERMA
[1:15:24] sibersilverfox: they give so much bonus tower damage they really are the thing to fight over early
[1:15:37] sidequest76: the weird thing about the grubs is the spawn timing.  if you're a farming champ you really want to hit 6 first
[1:15:54] megilino: some one was arguwing  with me that jg is ez all you do is gank botget drags thats it @Santorin
[1:16:21] megilino: lol
[1:16:27] TimeWizardLuL: good play
[1:16:33] koushik_10: it is jover for enemy
[1:16:36] koushik_10: u ahve 3 kils
[1:16:41] nwa4lifeTV: new emote mr. clean
[1:16:43] solidussovis: someone get this man a white tee shirt two sizes to small
[1:16:46] Mavvrix: im surprised you didnt greed for that blue
[1:16:57] spejderkongen: #Facts
[1:17:12] TimeWizardLuL: cassio fed so hecarim was worth money again so you can take it
[1:17:12] spejderkongen: Im jungle. Its never jungle dif, its more often lane diff
[1:17:14] solidussovis: sounds like bot is the strong role there
[1:17:19] spejderkongen: Hard to do shit as jungle if you are not on the same page as ur lanes ^^
[1:17:30] Teh_W1nd: Morning chatorinis
[1:17:33] ThePeePuddle: Jungle is probably one of the most dependant on goot teammates no?
[1:17:34] megilino: i was saying its harder to gank is seson and thats what he sead
[1:17:42] spejderkongen: @ThePeePuddle Exactly
[1:18:00] BachiXP_: what do u think about kraken into titanic cuz Stridebreaker is bad rn
[1:18:10] thedubbleblue: @ThePeePuddle yea
[1:18:16] spejderkongen: Most often its not possible to solo carry as jungle, you can assist lanes so good that you are carrying them to carry if it makes sense
[1:18:21] paaaanda1: @ThePeePuddle i'd say support, but jg right behind yes
[1:18:22] thedubbleblue: i have 100% winrate on rumble jngl LMAO
[1:18:40] megilino: nice
[1:18:40] paaaanda1: being a good support with a sht team is miserable
[1:18:43] jentesama: @thedubbleblue me 0 precent
[1:18:48] DAYbreakEUW: #Interpol
[1:18:49] lewhitehd69: YEP balanced
[1:18:50] spejderkongen: @paaaanda1 Support only dependent on his adc being good. Jungle dependent on all lanes being good in some way i'd say
[1:18:55] megilino: XD
[1:19:04] paaaanda1: @spejderkongen no, support roams, needs every laner to pay attention
[1:19:20] thedubbleblue: @thedubbleblue did u ever even play it
[1:19:23] spejderkongen: True, but rarely the sup roam top but yeah u are right about that actually
[1:19:29] megilino: would  amumu be good for geting them grubs or fiddel?
[1:19:30] spejderkongen: Dependent on elo
[1:19:32] paaaanda1: literally everything a support does is dependent on the team, like wards, if team doesnt use them, wards are useless
[1:19:34] solidussovis: @spejderkongen Jungle just needs 1 lane to play through. It can be any lane but you can't have a losing bot PERIOD
[1:19:45] Mavvrix: Whenever you have time Could you press Ctrl+ C to see the basic stats?
[1:20:01] DAYbreakEUW: huge minions wave.... with 0 minions

[1:20:28] sk8yardwizard: YO DONU PLAY
[1:20:36] Mavvrix: Rip ZZrot
[1:20:38] ThePeePuddle: sad aatrox, dies and loses two turrets
[1:20:42] thedubbleblue: 13m 2 items?
[1:20:45] thedubbleblue: wtff
[1:20:49] solidussovis: Sounds cooler at 12
[1:21:02] rot_trunks: Titanic on bel veth feels so good
[1:21:24] solidussovis: Titanic on everyone feels good. That item is BROKE
[1:21:33] paaaanda1: i feel like belveth is broken, but every time shes my jungler, the enemy just locks in rammus and bv kills herself all game
[1:22:31] TimeWizardLuL: Do u like this season more than previous?
[1:22:37] pentghast: looks like an FF angle
[1:22:47] nwa4lifeTV: 5 more seconds
[1:22:59] BachiXP_: what’s best third item?
[1:23:16] TimeWizardLuL: i like that there is no more mythics and u can build whatever
[1:23:29] Report_Baron: why is the new titanic hydra broken ?
[1:23:34] jentesama: all i can see is just like santorin, i like the change/variaty. The game became rly stale i had no fun in playing anymore
[1:23:44] catlover12435: holy shit LOL
[1:23:53] DAYbreakEUW: hahaha the shitter explosion!
[1:23:54] EdgedSilver: you can mount herald again btw
[1:23:57] EdgedSilver: if you kill a tower with it
[1:24:02] alabamahammer02: what makes titanic so good now?
[1:24:04] AxArme: the fact that the little void orbs spawn belveth's childen is so broken
[1:24:11] jentesama: herald is so weak
[1:24:23] thedubbleblue: 3 TURRETS AND 1 INHIB
[1:24:24] thedubbleblue: WTF
[1:24:26] DAYbreakEUW: you have to mount it again to "charge". It doesn'T do it by itself
[1:24:32] Myst3420: Would you say you are having more fun on this patch than last seasons final patch?
[1:24:37] ThePeePuddle: bro you have taken every tower so far LOL
[1:24:49] Osami100: It should play the star powerup music from Mario when you get in the herald for the charge
[1:25:37] johaido12: how about terminus on beleth
[1:26:02] solidussovis: I am legit surprised Bel isn't ban literally every game
[1:26:11] George_peris: hey hot to put champions icon on top of mini map?
[1:26:18] TimeWizardLuL: D:

[1:27:35] FroGGyWatchah: "Show Team Frames on left
[1:27:39] Teh_W1nd: I think its default to ontop of mini map
[1:28:08] TimeWizardLuL: is tanks op this season cause u cant stack armor pen anymore?
[1:28:08] raxxman: @NeverWorse95 kinda, it did get it's ms bonus buffed though, so that's something :D
[1:28:37] nwa4lifeTV: u mean move the champ icons to the side?
[1:28:49] Sylvain269: Why does Shojin have stacks
[1:28:56] BachiXP_: what would u think about trying terminus first over kraken since it also gives resistances early
[1:28:58] noonifer: oh boy cant wait to watch the POE volibear twitter vod.

[1:29:59] Sylvain269: Should've been gone years ago
[1:30:08] Teh_W1nd: Mythics should've never been added in the first place
