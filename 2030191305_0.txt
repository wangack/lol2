[0:25:22] diego_lopsan: Is it not better navori? So u have E faster
[0:25:23] wildriftboi1: @ADCPurple its season 12 botlane stuff when xayah wasnt really good
[0:25:29] kaerl_: what I dont like is how we are just back to oneshot meta
[0:25:40] kaerl_: all the games I had so far are either you oneshot or get oneshot
[0:25:57] wildriftboi1: ohhhhh yea dura patch does nothing anymore
[0:26:00] wildriftboi1: in that sense
[0:26:08] ADCPurple: @wildriftboi1 yeah and youre getting out ranged by all the on hit adcs and mages so its just gg unlucky

[0:27:45] wildriftboi1: i like lucian vs aphelios skill check
[0:27:50] tayros3: maybe for pro play
[0:27:51] ADCPurple: 50% aph win rate is crazy needs to be 46
[0:27:51] kaerl_: 50% Aphel is too much I guess
[0:27:54] lazarztwtv: jack, can i get 2 3 champs that r super good rn to spam
[0:27:57] gugaa1402: if they were more squishy what item would you go instead of ldr?

[0:28:45] kaerl_: Vayne seems weak to me
[0:29:15] karmaik77: is zeri any good now?
[0:29:20] ADCPurple: 3 points q, w max after. Bork, rageblade terminus into tank
[0:29:40] ADCPurple: can switch terminus into wits into heavy ap
[0:29:43] tayros3: and u play top or bot?
[0:29:43] F0NCHOO: kind of an 1v9 angle tbh
[0:29:56] itsvortexvr: good afternoon beast! hope ur day is going well spktrLove
[0:30:14] wacharucas7: Hello Jack, why take last standing instead of cut down. Isn't cut down scaling better here? :)
[0:30:16] ADCPurple: ive only played 1 vayne bot game was against mid emerald players and 1 top game
[0:30:28] ADCPurple: so idk how good it would be against actual players but hey
[0:30:31] ADCPurple: felt good
[0:30:48] tayros3: must be good since every1 plays tanks
[0:30:53] LureshLAN: @ADCPurple u almost got me writing that build down and shit bro
[0:31:08] ADCPurple: i mean its still a good build
[0:31:11] kaerl_: o7

[0:32:23] TroyThe2nd: @tayros3 what server do you live in nobody plays tanks
[0:32:30] kaerl_: also, I noticed that im often just spectator as adc this season. Both supports leave for grubs and 4vs4 toplane decides who snowballs
[0:32:40] F0NCHOO: bork > hexplate > terminus > into tank
[0:32:48] F0NCHOO: felt decent tbh
[0:33:06] tayros3: @TroyThe2nd euw d4
[0:33:20] tayros3: every1 spams udyr jgl on my games
[0:33:31] tayros3: and poppy maokai
[0:33:58] TroyThe2nd: that's crazy, i can't get a tank in my game if i prayed for one
[0:34:20] ADCPurple: rageblade is kinda op on vayne @F0NCHOO
[0:34:26] ADCPurple: provs terminus too
[0:34:29] ADCPurple: procs
[0:34:34] TroyThe2nd: hell even this game there's only 1 real tank and it's maokai, unless you'er counting like darius
[0:34:54] wildriftboi1: @TroyThe2nd i think ornn is good
[0:35:11] wildriftboi1: but damn ppl dont wanna bore themselves with tanks
[0:35:20] F0NCHOO: @ADCPurple maybe rageblade instead of hexplate, but i like the health it gives since u ar getting resistances after
[0:35:25] badjaobas: tyrnda
[0:35:48] ADCPurple: @F0NCHOO yeah true but 2 full tank items is already good enough honestly
[0:36:07] TroyThe2nd: the 1 death loss heartbreaker
[0:36:12] ADCPurple: 13 assists ouch

[0:44:28] kaerl_: 3 days. take it or leave it
[0:44:32] 1lmann2: as an aphelios main this hurts
[0:44:36] wildriftboi1: im an aphel main but i dont wanna make the aphel very op
[0:44:37] Tcyy: Yes Jack but.. 50% in the hands of randoms is 70 in hands of players like you
[0:44:38] potfriend166: i dont even see ppl play aphelioslol
[0:44:40] Tcyy: (said from below your desk)
[0:44:42] smileyisdeath: hahah you had gesture like that actor whats his name again, cruise?
[0:44:44] Baummam: well he is a hard champ and a one trick champ, pretty sure good players got a bit over50% with him
[0:44:46] itsvortexvr: he saw the light at the end of the tunnel
[0:44:49] vuntras: Aphelios get just nerfs
[0:44:51] itsvortexvr: and found out it was a train
[0:44:53] itsvortexvr: LUL
[0:45:19] peddroo1: do we know what are they nerfing from the champ?
[0:45:43] xcalebur: hes below average
[0:45:43] vashisnothere: pro play?
[0:45:47] bononah: well hes below average
[0:45:49] jokerfeverpro: Not them saying on the tweet that they are trying not to nerf a champ and the items it uses on the same patch while doing the exact same thing with aphelios xd
[0:45:50] Zinai: aphelios is just being jailed by pro-play
[0:45:51] xcalebur: 52.48 avg is 52.87
[0:45:56] potfriend166: how is draven below average
[0:45:57] kaerl_: No way people rather play vs Draven over Aphel
[0:45:57] potfriend166: hes broken
[0:46:01] Baummam: it is the sing of a failed champ design to be in low winrate jail, ask Zerri
[0:46:03] jokerfeverpro: Not pulling a riot move while doing so
[0:46:09] vashisnothere: yes but hasnt he be perma prio when hes decent for the last like 3 years?
[0:46:14] Foxiz: @potfriend166 he is not but aphelios is
[0:46:19] ADCPurple: well i think even if he is broken in pro play its okay for him to just be 100% pick ban
[0:46:20] ADCPurple: like
[0:46:27] ADCPurple: screw it let him be decent for a patch
[0:46:41] ADCPurple: they let neeko do that

[0:47:56] vashisnothere: yeye they keep him weak because people dont want to see him in every game
[0:48:18] Baummam: btw when are they gonna change the name back to flat armour pen ? Now that it the same as magic pen the name is just kinda confusing for new players
[0:48:26] ADCPurple: @vashisnothere but we see ori, neeko, poppy, maokai every game in worlds
[0:48:28] IcyRickard: is it not worse at lvl 18?
[0:48:50] ADCPurple: kennen is funny hehe
[0:48:57] laskaat: Thx for answering boss
[0:48:58] vashisnothere: @vashisnothere not really
[0:49:03] Baummam: maybe they didt change the name because they are not a 100% that it will stay like this ?

[1:01:34] Baummam: almost true dmg with one item
[1:01:37] 365Doors: there is never too much lethality
[1:01:43] 365Doors: :^)

[1:03:02] wildriftboi1: Sadge
[1:03:06] elestudioesunmito: Wait so whats the difference between lethality and armor pen if lethality is always 100% and doesnt scale with levels

[1:03:07] wildriftboi1: didnt get youmuus
[1:03:16] Sorvicer: well guess you have to play another aphelios game, what a shame Kappa
[1:03:48] failshot12: So should we just max E on Aphelios ? or mix E and Q
[1:03:49] Baummam: still have the feeling the name didt get changed so it is easier to nerf it back to the old if it turns out to be op
[1:03:51] elestudioesunmito: So they are interchangeable now basically
[1:03:55] rases00: have you seen the potential ad tf buffs jack?

[4:22:06] psychedb: !duo
[4:22:06] Nightbot: whiteinn
[4:22:36] roroRoninn: can’t believe they nerfed aphelios
[4:22:47] Marekseuw: yeah he goes from mid to unplayable cant wait
[4:22:49] jezior00: no way u win this game
[4:23:13] amritgakhal: hello mr jack
[4:23:22] Marekseuw: at least last season u had galeforce but now even that is gone and all ur damage gets removed on b patch
[4:23:36] alex_myer: essence reaver gets buffed ?
[4:23:46] daniradc: yes
[4:23:49] roroRoninn: meanwhile MF shredding  throw everything
[4:23:55] scriptkiddieno11: is ER not good on lucian?
[4:24:02] Marekseuw: ER is good on nothing
[4:24:04] Marekseuw: useless item
[4:24:40] daniradc: er with draven can be interesting if it gets overbuffed
[4:25:04] Marekseuw: just does less damage than a lethality item (which are cheaper)
[4:25:43] jezior00: im kinda sad for gragas
[4:25:44] reeiaa: catClap catClap
[4:25:44] jezior00: gg
[4:25:53] xcalebur: looked real strong while you were running away from gragas whole game
[4:26:00] BlindHer0: with cyclo a dash gives like 40 energize
[4:26:02] 666Dazai: gj i was graves
[4:26:10] amritgakhal: bro tell us about new build for adcs
[4:26:19] unrealsato: yeah it feels really strong
[4:26:20] BlindHer0: yeah felt good
[4:26:21] 666Dazai: it is nice but i see flakked going collector
[4:26:24] Marekseuw: new builds Clueless
[4:26:26] michaelscottdn: I don't think too much
[4:26:27] sheefto_lol: with nami/milio seems fine
[4:26:28] unrealsato: feels better with 1st strike than with pta
[4:26:28] hbsz: was it not just nami dmg
[4:26:37] daniradc: after with 4 items lethality-crit draven i hit nothing vs jaksho varus i just became depressed
[4:26:40] BlindHer0: i think this build is good with nami for burst
[4:26:41] irdi19: Every item felt a powerspike @jackspektra
[4:26:43] hbsz: ye true
[4:26:47] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!

[4:27:07] izz0na: the lucian was even buy sorcerer shoes for nami dmg
[4:27:13] cathy_raven: Hi Jack! How's your day going?
[4:27:16] cathy_raven: Hi chat!
[4:27:17] BlindHer0: if you are cycling energized well i dont know if you need navori
[4:27:19] unrealsato: its always same 1st 3 item then you build depanding of the game like collector or lord dom
[4:27:23] daniradc: why does allways ie feels so underwhelming?
[4:27:25] tomipacy37: voltaic > collector/storm > rapid > ie
[4:27:38] michaelscottdn: Shadowflame op
[4:27:40] 666Dazai: grudge no last?
[4:27:47] 666Dazai: better than ldr maybe
[4:27:58] Marekseuw: navori for sure just does the most damage though no?
[4:28:05] cycclol: hey jack what supports do you think are best right now?
[4:28:06] platrbx: thoughts on terminus?
[4:28:07] s1nnocent2151997: isnt first strike better post 2 items?
[4:28:13] unrealsato: navori feels pretty bad with this build
