[1:05:52] Xiunitv: show me something special

[1:07:19] llamasweater192837: @spacecowboyr not asking for balance just for hunters pet to not be braindead broken, classic wow isn't balanced and sod won't be either with the influx of new spells. Just saying hunter pets are broken and not fun.
[1:07:29] marlonbrdo: as warlock you just need to click drain life and you ll never die in pvp but hunters are the problem Kappa

[1:08:40] Gemini_Iceland: I wonder if someone managed to camp a hunter so bad and kill his pet so often that it left him
[1:08:43] chamboulos: i got the sword and the crossbonow im only missing the staff
[1:08:46] marlonbrdo: @crawds  still a thing
[1:09:03] Sentotaipu: @Gemini_Iceland unless it is a brand new pet that would take insanely long
[1:09:19] bradstick: it won't leave unless it's at the lowest possible loyalty
[1:09:26] bradstick: it will derank loyalty before it lefts
[1:09:31] bradstick: *leaves
[1:09:52] Sentotaipu: thats more toxic than when you camped that dog in hillsbrad

[1:26:59] warriorbaby93: 1 million %
[1:27:00] m1nyar: is SoD > Classic HC?

[1:27:20] NAP4LMx: waay too long, if it was like 20th something january life would beh uge
[1:27:21] Xiunitv: gotta remember that the longer it takes the better the new patch will be tbh

[1:27:24] Xiunitv: more things 2 do
[1:27:26] lil__dolo: 6 weeks milked to 12 ppc

[1:27:59] spacecowboyr: want to know what the new hunter runes are so  bad
[1:28:02] bradstick: the problem is they have wrath and cata shit to do at the same time and the holidays... that's why the phase was as long, constrained blizzard resources
[1:28:05] SanMuki: @Xiunitv pepeD dont worry its a jammer
[1:28:09] medskie: bfd is a joke but i like the casualness

[1:36:34] shaggy462: @don_jaym making changes with pvp in mind, and its effecting pve, it feels great
[1:36:49] reazzor: being able to solo much higher level content is pve
[1:36:51] happyheals: just give Hunter pets a debuff that makes them have a small chance to attack the hunter for 5 seconds until they hit level 60
[1:36:55] bradstick: should change BM rune to increased threat instead of damage
[1:37:00] fafoo204: @happyheals KEK
[1:37:01] don_jaym: probably fair for pvp but hunters are soon back to classic pve where they are less then mediocre

[1:59:32] Trainingtobeperson: league basically got rid of postgame lobby bc peoplle only usedd it to cuss each other out
[1:59:34] technikill_: or just make intentional bad picks if you dont give them pick position
[1:59:48] happyheals: hots storm league bronze and silver players
[1:59:52] wenturi123: Insted of grinding at 60, now you grind at 25, 40, 50 and 60.
[1:59:53] Bard_TheBowman: Na, Sa servers for Dota are toxic and griefr AF, and they say SEA servers are even worst
[2:00:01] gwei_tv: dota has all chat, team voice chat, and a postgame lobby chat. DotA>>>
[2:00:21] shadowthehedgehog97: league of lasagna for sure worse thandota
[2:00:25] Theultimatewho: sounds like WSG
[2:00:27] bigppgirl: deserved tho, who the fuck you think you are stealing HIS role and champ
[2:00:45] korbz_fgc: yeah thats toxic
[2:00:53] xiaolinh: classic the cannon minion smite
[2:00:54] Meetras: bro smiting a cannon is bm af XD
[2:00:55] Simpotta: KEKW
[2:01:01] gwei_tv: you can pickpocket this boss btw
[2:01:01] Meetras: that can really set someone crazy
[2:01:14] happyheals: you made an impact on someones life

[2:01:30] jimbonni: bed they all have blue hair
[2:01:37] JesseJson: Any game where there are healers is like that
[2:01:38] Rakschas: league is a necessary evil. it is a honeypot for the assholes of the internet
[2:01:47] fl0rilla: they hella buffed the support items where you lose vs 1 item support as a carry
[2:01:51] 17lp: tbh i would it ran it too KEKW
[2:01:57] happyheals: at least hots has shared xp
[2:02:10] luuciiiiiiaa: yo can we swap
[2:02:13] Simpotta: KEKW
[2:02:14] fishb0mb: KEKL
[2:02:33] Koshintu: "First Blood" teammates: ff ggwp
[2:02:39] Meetras: league community is extremely fragile
[2:02:43] luuciiiiiiaa: 15 mins ff
[2:02:44] mongolstwitch: mongolstwitch subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Soon pompyro duo!
[2:02:45] stehfann: btw during march u should stack up combo points :3
[2:02:56] warriorbaby93: except for the guy who got cdank killed in onlyfangs lol
[2:03:06] BodSenpai: i've legit quit wow over its community, peoples brains just melt playing it
[2:03:12] PizzzaDog: league's ranked mode is also really toxic everyone cheats with smurf accounts
[2:03:16] happyheals: Some people sleep paladins outside of the battle area
[2:03:17] Xavsfr: What about voice in wow
[2:03:19] happyheals: lol
[2:03:32] santastacks: cannon is a big deal
[2:03:43] lil__dolo: set boots Kappa
[2:03:44] technikill_: dota2 doesn't have an FF feature. arguably makes it worse based off just that
[2:03:48] Meetras: u smite my cannon on a bad day in a lane im behind to a lane bully that might send me
[2:03:51] Mixedcolors: does crippling or instant go on offhand for backstab build
[2:03:52] purplepoodle89: the in-game wow voicechat is commicaly bad
[2:03:53] xiaolinh: wow needs proximity voice chat
[2:03:59] Koshintu: BigBrother
[2:04:07] Xavsfr: yea i mean proxi voice
[2:04:23] Xavsfr: would actually be interesting lol
[2:04:24] purplepoodle89: seriously, that would be good
[2:04:45] Trainingtobeperson: after wipe 7 on week 3 of twin emps people get pretty salty
[2:04:57] BodSenpai: nah his problem
[2:05:11] BiggieBoyZ: he just letting the mage know he woulda won if I wanted to
[2:05:17] magickdoge: That would be Pog
[2:05:26] Theultimatewho: just gotta let them know its snooze/loose
[2:05:39] goatedsp: SOLO SHUFFLE
[2:05:42] goatedsp: I LOVE ITTT
[2:05:43] Wood7: YES
[2:05:45] Leqt: So true
[2:05:49] happyheals: proximity voice in wow would turn it into a chat roulette
[2:05:53] Koshintu: Mythic+ if you ask me
[2:06:04] swapAllDay: rated bg?
[2:06:05] AlwaysWock: you'll lose guilder leaders in Rated Bgs KEK
[2:06:05] Trainingtobeperson: and league is basically 100% rated bgs
[2:06:07] ChaozT: yea Mythic
[2:06:11] AlwaysWock: GUILD*
[2:06:46] Dexlizyo: well but in rbgs you'll get yelled at even tho you are winning
[2:07:07] solokue: yup, kekL
[2:07:13] lil__dolo: lowest level of investment in your team and highest stake in the outcome
[2:07:24] happyheals: add a solo shuffle community rating system
[2:07:46] crymorre: rbg community is radioactive from my experience
[2:07:47] happyheals: if you have low community rating you play other low rating
[2:07:54] mr_az3k: Hotted kek
[2:08:19] technikill_: hear me out - STV pvp event turns entire zone into a battle royal event, FFA no factions. you dont get to use your normal gear. player kills and random chests grant specific pvp event loot that expires at end of event. WoW + pubg.
[2:08:25] goatedsp: Solo queue RBG is coming to retail next expansion
[2:08:37] HecticSpaniard: LUL
[2:08:51] happyheals: the same people prob huff paint
[2:08:58] ximu11: for me its the opposite, i'm good at bgs but bad at arenas
[2:08:59] Meetras: ya my friends who play wsg all day were suprised they lost to arena players in wargames. i was like wtf u expect
[2:09:08] purplepoodle89: not true, especially in WSG it needs to be played as a team and like chess
[2:09:08] mr_az3k: was gonna say, have you seen Mitch PVE? kek
[2:09:18] motod0x: you could even say if youre good in duels youre auto good in arena and bgs too no?
[2:09:29] motod0x: duels is like the foundation
[2:09:33] lil__dolo: @motod0x no just look at payo
[2:09:34] bl4ck0outt: i remember the +15 keys in Legion. I saw the PvP skill translated to PvE
[2:09:39] b_lappy: fragile egos in this world
[2:09:40] happyheals: Mes forced me to get good fast in 2v2 arena the past few days
[2:09:41] damnzy: im a rank 1 inc caller in bgs no arena player is betta
[2:09:43] goatedsp: DK/WW/ Resto druid is turbo cancer rn
[2:09:52] bricktown88: DOESNT WANT IT
[2:10:03] ayvalol: ziqo just described me LUL
[2:10:05] happyheals: from 0 to 1600 against all 2200 rating people on my druid in greens lol
[2:10:10] bricktown88: i saw the mace last night for the first time
[2:10:15] bradstick: can't parse on feral without it
[2:10:21] g_1_t: cant blame the feral druid i literallt have 3 fists of the wild
[2:10:24] GOLDNxyz: Naxx
[2:10:25] bricktown88: that mace is definitely as good/better than any of the bfd epics
[2:10:26] g_1_t: drops so much
[2:10:28] Wooleh__: first feral weapon was world boss dragons lol
[2:10:33] Koshintu: AQ 1h mace has that stuff
[2:10:33] blommiiz: fkin busted weapon
[2:10:36] nickelius: I think the first one was from AQ, the mace.
[2:10:37] GOLDNxyz: And green dragons
[2:10:39] Dexlizyo: I think a big problem about rbgs is that its a dead bracket. 3k Teams are liaterally playing vs 2,1k teams and get like +2 every game and think they are good while farming low mmr and dodging real teams
[2:10:54] prodigy_wow: They should have made the rogue dagger epic too just for the sake of purple
[2:11:43] flica: wasn't this raid supposed to be for lvling? why does it have lockout?
[2:11:55] diamond11gfat: ye remember
[2:12:18] ayvalol: LUL
[2:12:23] g_1_t: ??

[2:12:32] Atm0sf3arlol: 100% GCD AT heroes LOL
[2:12:35] goatedsp: if youre only good in BGs youre probably just getting carried
[2:12:43] danzori1: lmaooo exactly
[2:12:52] ayvalol: true
[2:12:57] dumpringz: good at afking in the gy
[2:13:12] crymorre: good at coping
[2:13:21] lIlREDFOXlIl: ur food can talk?
[2:13:35] Ahbe: @ziqo i juked u once in WoD, easy
[2:13:37] happyheals: what if we are bad at everything but somehow squeak out decent ratings
[2:14:29] mr_az3k: my feral got mcd this morning, clapped a mage LUL
[2:14:35] crymorre: what does ppc mean
[2:15:02] GrandpaReno: @crymorre basically good or bad depending
[2:15:15] Acidgirl_123: Waddup ghetto superstars DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:15:30] ArkoM8: Are hunters shit now?
[2:15:38] nickelius: @ArkoM8 na
[2:15:44] goatedsp: doaeneINGAME doaeneINGAME doaeneINGAME doaeneINGAME
[2:15:45] ayvalol: is there any ladder mages that you thought were amazing but nobody has really heard of ?
[2:15:48] Trainingtobeperson: like butt stuff
[2:15:53] cyanne112: i've often seen the same thing for LoL, especially for  diamond, some players have insane mechanics and others know how to play the game and what to do. But they are still same rating.
[2:16:04] Sharara1: Quality of people you team up with generally is better also
