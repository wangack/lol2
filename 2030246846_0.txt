[0:48:48] SuperWali: @ty_mentallyill only crucible is 120fps iirc
[0:48:57] anxious_joe: FPS makes a big difference to gameplay right
[0:49:19] anxious_joe: Console capped at 60

[0:49:48] Dat_boing21: @ty_mentallyill for better and worse
[0:49:50] SuperWali: i think in destiny pve is at 60 and crucible is 120 on ps5s and Xbox series X's
[0:50:04] anxious_joe: destiny can support 120 for PvP but cod can't  sad times
[0:50:36] SuperWali: but most other games have i believe performance modes or w/e to get 120 fps at 1080p
[0:50:43] menecboi: menecboi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[0:51:06] SuperWali: Ron lifts dont work at 60+ frames
[0:51:34] anxious_joe: Pc is so cool man can do soo much more
