[0:58:14] Sunnytinker: you know yasao players are so bad that they even died in the cinematic kaypTroll
[0:58:29] Niomah: I liked the concept of the cinematic, past present future at someone's end, do they fight or accept death
[0:58:36] supercole2001: Aatrox wrecking Kayle was funny
[0:58:40] Darkcyter: Morgana's moment and Ashe's entry, chef's kiss

[0:59:04] Smoothcollie: Right? Kindred concept in general is amazing, seeing them appear in it was top
[0:59:13] The1997wiki: you saw the yasuo old man skin ?
[0:59:20] let_james_play: i watched Necrits breakdown of the cinematic and apparetnyl the Yasou death isnt real, its a possible ending to his life shown to him by Kindred
[0:59:26] exp0elk0: personally I’m happy to see my perma ban potentially pass away
[0:59:35] hamzatjeee: why was morgana hurting when she was using he chains?
[0:59:44] Sunnytinker: i also liked how they gave wolf feet idk it made it more epic

[1:00:08] yanjii: im watching you while playing lux lolz
[1:00:09] let_james_play: yeah, i just re-watched Arcane for the 4th time
[1:00:13] Darkcyter: What I gathered from the explanations on youtube that these three scenarios are past (kayle, morgana vs aatrox), future (old yasuo) and present (tryn vs kindred)
[1:00:13] Sunnytinker: yeah the yasao death situation is just riot backup for if they want to change it
[1:00:18] Frozenfruit13: work from home is slow today so having company is nice
[1:00:34] Darkcyter: learned*

[1:31:58] Smoothcollie: I'm probably glad I cannot play, that's so messy hey
[1:32:03] mrshibasan: I think that Rengar did the most stupid strat (the bad kind of stupid) he just wait out to grab items or last hit
[1:32:06] marcelineth3vampirequeen: hey kp! what are some new problems you've encountered with the new season?
[1:32:11] Artilonn: have u seen that lux got buffed
[1:32:12] daddybubbles2: i mostly play kat, akali, and ahri in midlane so i just despise fizz in general already to be fair
[1:32:18] Lazy_Matty: @marcelineth3vampirequeen fizz
[1:32:21] iiVera: PrideFloat PrideFloat
[1:32:23] mrshibasan: Is a lame strat

[1:32:52] daddybubbles2: @ObsceneSanity fizz and rengar can just bypass frontline though sadly
[1:32:55] BabaaBear17: I perma ban him instead of yasuo or yone
[1:33:03] VoltAmpereReactive: what do u think of the new map so far
[1:33:09] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity yes, but darius showing up 2 minutes after the fight ended doesnt help either
[1:33:22] daddybubbles2: i definitely like the changes but they have a lot of hotfixes and adjustments to make imo, i wish there was a preseason
[1:33:33] exp0elk0: I wonder how ad mids feel right now

[2:01:22] cagatayyyldrm: where is your jung? ww came 2 times
[2:01:27] Sunnytinker: yeah
[2:01:37] BabaaBear17: I think you and viktor switched it’d be easier for both of you lol
[2:01:42] lawfulevil_13: Your jungle is probably doing this to "punish" you for not playing a tank
[2:01:51] arcadedani: Rengar probably not coming top because he is not ok whit you taking a Cassio top
[2:01:52] proximamidnightx: atp ww should just build a tent in there
[2:01:56] lawfulevil_13: This is part of his tantrum
[2:02:05] IIRhynoII: this is why no one plays jng; they get all the flak
[2:02:17] Necrothia: if ww was complaining i wouldn't be surprised if he was not comming top
[2:02:55] IceyWind_: you described half of the playerbase of this game tbh
[2:03:04] IceyWind_: theyd rather lose than be wrong
[2:03:05] 4braxis: everyone picks a single measurement to prove the preconceived notions physics has forced them to commit to time
[2:03:18] el_mitro: why mages don't play in mid lane today xD?
[2:03:21] dontonimobae: dontonimobae subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hope all is well. Locking it down for another month kaypLove
[2:03:24] pedrito420: what was that?
[2:03:25] cagatayyyldrm: yeah and they still don't  understand that is a team based game
[2:03:40] IIRhynoII: turn chat off, simple solution
[2:03:59] lawfulevil_13: How to say you're a little bitch without saying you're a little bitch

[2:07:49] littlejellyfishy: rengo found the way top :O
[2:08:15] Teekwan: I didn't know that Battlesong is still in the game, i thought they removed that item, btw the new item names are so weird, one guy in the other chat said how blank item is op and i was like no saying cuss words xD
[2:08:21] CipherAdminShady: that was really unfortunate
[2:08:23] QTwinkyyy: BTW new Riftmaker gives AP based on bonus health so they're definitely wanting tanks to be OP this season
[2:08:35] BabaaBear17: cosmic drive is amazing this season for Cassiopeia btw
[2:08:37] justchatta: hello kelsie <3
[2:08:41] ObsceneSanity: does ww have Sundering bc him being low is a trap
[2:08:58] sovitiaisavampire: what doesnt kill us makes us want to play camille with busted items
[2:08:59] sovitiaisavampire: Keepo
[2:08:59] twinkerbell_xo: @QTwinkyyy isn't that just the old demonic embrace passive

[2:09:27] ObsceneSanity: wellp thats a report
[2:09:30] Galetea: yikes rengar
[2:09:30] P4zzie: kinda find it sad that 75% of builds remain the same, with maybe one item being subbed in for another
[2:09:32] Siempje010: Haii :D
[2:09:38] P4zzie: new itemization looks fun thou
[2:09:39] xLippyy: rough day of league of legends in ya'lls house hold today
[2:09:42] proximamidnightx: omg that vlad is going to be huge problem
[2:09:42] marcelineth3vampirequeen: the rate of triple - penta kills has sky rocketed
[2:09:43] QTwinkyyy: @twinkerbell_xo yeah except it also gives damage boost based on time in combat up to 10%
[2:09:46] Sunnytinker: with this new season i feel like its so snowbally like the chance of a comeback is so slim
[2:09:48] Ezkhel: catJAM
[2:09:53] FiveFM: Report the nasty kitty! kaypRiot
[2:10:03] twinkerbell_xo: @QTwinkyyy ohhh well that sucks
[2:10:18] wolterbrm2021: ikr
[2:11:04] w0wzors: I kinda hate the new items and feel of the new  season so far. Love the map though
[2:11:23] Teekwan: Is that like bard chimes?
[2:11:40] FiveFM: It’s 10/18 you giant BABIES!
[2:11:49] IIRhynoII: rough
[2:11:51] Teekwan: What are these kindles you're collecting?
[2:11:53] Necrothia: when they say that i usually ask them :D its so funny to see them reply with a funny awnser :D
[2:11:54] LilithHeleno: OMG WW HI kaypCheer
[2:12:29] xLippyy: YOU WANT
[2:12:32] xLippyy: it thattt wayyyy
[2:12:39] Necrothia: go maliglance ? idk if that would help
[2:12:52] IIRhynoII: @Teekwan it's related to drag
[2:13:09] P4zzie: freaking mcScuse me???
[2:13:09] alluring_grace: vlad seems broken
[2:13:10] drakemore000: ridiculous spell vamp
[2:13:11] Necrothia: what the hell is up with that healing
[2:13:19] TurtleIam: whats up
[2:13:21] RoyalKovn: ROA not it
[2:13:23] grandmakrystal: does anyone on your team have antiheal? \
[2:13:29] vves24: all healing is dump right now
[2:13:32] proximamidnightx: LMAOOO
[2:13:38] proximamidnightx: RENGAR RAGE QUITTED
[2:13:44] sovitiaisavampire: why dont you cheer your fellow vampires? Keepo
[2:13:46] P4zzie: anti heal is not a mechanic that has been viable for like 2 seasons now
[2:13:50] ObsceneSanity: Lol rengar going for the full ban
[2:14:06] IceyWind_: vlad is just raid boss lately
[2:14:17] RG_lasluces: RG_lasluces subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! hello kp and chat how the games are doing today ? kaypArrive kaypLove
[2:14:17] Hextio: Rengar mad for being bad? XD
[2:14:19] Galetea: MANS FLEW
[2:14:30] QTwinkyyy: yeah the new riftmaker should definitely get nerfed soon. If you haven't seen the stats it's really interesting the direction they went with it.
[2:14:36] Teekwan: So you're saying there's a chance you'll learn Yasuo?
[2:14:43] IIRhynoII: vlad is one of those champs thats only played by those who really know how to paly him
[2:14:46] SerpentisRex: smh needs the kit rework already
[2:14:57] Necrothia: its disgusting he can just walk under turret and do that
[2:15:01] Wolfvet_: weekend games are always shit :D
[2:15:07] ObsceneSanity: yasuo is probably one of the easiest champs to handle right now
[2:15:13] catttini: only time i see a vlad is a smurf or one trick
[2:15:19] IIRhynoII: his blood pool is like fizz's trident hop -- insta-tilt
[2:15:20] xNocchi: What did i miss TwitchConHYPE
[2:15:22] proximamidnightx: nice tryy np
[2:15:30] P4zzie: i have 100% banned vlad in my games since 2018
[2:15:32] sovitiaisavampire: sounds like a regular league match
[2:15:34] P4zzie: glad to see thats not changing
[2:15:35] boriseto: I know it's late but the first item I build against Vlad is always oblivion orb. It really helps to maintain him
[2:15:43] IIRhynoII: I perma-ban fizz in mid
[2:15:50] k0t10n: no real hwei
[2:15:50] krobylos: league gives me a headache lol
[2:16:05] BackpackGotJets: your team needs heal cut. they got WW and vlad
[2:16:05] krobylos: I like watching though
[2:16:09] IIRhynoII: league is a drug, headache is just a side effect lol
[2:16:14] xNocchi: @iirhynoii me too, he's disgusting
[2:16:17] proximamidnightx: the game is broken but the community is 10 times worse
[2:16:23] w0wzors: Fizz is ridiculous right now
[2:16:32] IIRhynoII: he's always been ridiculous
[2:16:39] ajak636: have u played against sion this season? he's so op
[2:16:42] IIRhynoII: he and teemo are top 2 most hated
[2:17:03] Napskee: i've only played two games so far this season and i'm debating taking a break until adjustments are made
[2:17:07] xNocchi: Yea but no one played Fizz last season, now he's in 9 out of 10 games
[2:17:07] ObsceneSanity: I ff these games
[2:17:13] gwar13_: hii, im new
[2:17:15] IIRhynoII: morde top is op in s14
[2:17:17] alluring_grace: A fed Ahri, Lux could never do that is sad
[2:17:19] P4zzie: nah, this is winnable Kappa
[2:17:24] kenschwifty: @xNocchi cuz he was permabanned
[2:17:30] Sunnytinker: this is why there should of been a preseason
[2:17:31] P4zzie: riot is a small indie company with no QA testers
[2:17:38] P4zzie: its not THEIR fault
[2:17:39] TurtleIam: yes
[2:17:43] Galetea: mord is really broken rn
[2:17:47] krobylos: I heard akali is op
[2:17:47] IIRhynoII: @Sunnytinker instead of preseason, they did beta-testing
[2:17:48] marcelineth3vampirequeen: when are the hot fixes coming ?
[2:17:55] proximamidnightx: @P4zzie the money they gain is no small tho
[2:17:59] TheDadministrator: Split 1 is just preseason
[2:18:07] IIRhynoII: they left out like 5 items bc of beta testing
[2:18:13] ObsceneSanity: the devs already said that a preseason wouldnt matter because players would wait for ranked play to try things out anyways
[2:18:18] xNocchi: Pre season is always soo messy
[2:18:21] 4braxis: my games have been super silly too
[2:18:22] TheDadministrator: I think of the splits as a development of the patch anyway
[2:18:25] xtfxvindicated: it has to be items changes he wasnt this strong last season?
[2:18:27] IIRhynoII: @ObsceneSanity facts
[2:18:31] TheDadministrator: Split 3 is the one that matters
[2:18:43] littlejellyfishy: I went 15/2 with lux vs galio and belveth ! I am happy kaypCheer kaypCheer
[2:18:43] FiveFM: Nope, a mage with MR is still squishy… :(
[2:18:55] cuzzie_: It's proof that in this season,  if you're behind, there is no way of coming back and winning
[2:18:57] IIRhynoII: it was the range, veigar playedl ike a poke mage vs u
[2:19:00] TurtleIam: ????????????????
[2:19:00] SerpentisRex: yuck
[2:19:01] marcelineth3vampirequeen: omg
[2:19:02] arcadedani: yes it is
[2:19:03] xNocchi: Wtf
[2:19:03] twinkerbell_xo: LMAOOO
[2:19:03] Smoothcollie: Oh. Oooooh kaypAwkward
[2:19:04] meep_: kaypUpsetti
[2:19:04] MolecularMustard: wow
[2:19:05] Sunnytinker: .................    :l
[2:19:05] Kunkies: That vlad damage
[2:19:05] pedrito420: xD
[2:19:06] ablasyonic: omg
[2:19:08] BabaaBear17: oh my goddddddd
[2:19:10] Kunkies: is disgusting
[2:19:10] BabaaBear17: lmao
[2:19:11] cagatayyyldrm: kaypTroll kaypTroll
[2:19:13] Tritros: kaypRiot
[2:19:17] 4braxis: I  haven't seen a vlad or a jayce in forever
[2:19:17] pedrito420: Vlad Kekw Kekw
[2:19:17] Smoothcollie: Riooooot kaypShame
[2:19:18] ablasyonic: balanced
[2:19:20] littlejellyfishy: kaypWHAT kaypWHAT
[2:19:24] berdewisangry: I mean, veigar did the right thing. Let the carry, carry and not be a dead weight
[2:19:26] arcadedani: told you Vladimir was going to be horrible xD
[2:19:29] FiveFM: kaypWHAT
[2:19:29] Riikkuuuu: 50k?
[2:19:32] Riikkuuuu: wtfff
[2:19:34] ObsceneSanity: he was oneshotting your team in fountain
[2:19:39] Kunkies: How?!
[2:19:41] berdewisangry: To be carried is a mindset too
[2:19:48] EatBac0n: well the 13 people are gonna be rch of that prediction
[2:19:48] arcadedani: Rengar expecting anything different vs a Vladimir is well stupid xD
[2:19:54] IIRhynoII: akali, fizz, kass, katarina best midlaners so far in s14
[2:20:03] QTwinkyyy: Yeah the thing is they messed up Omnivamp with the new season and they made it easier for certain champs and Riftmaker enables it to be too fucked up
[2:20:14] Smoothcollie: Next game is the game, I feel it!
[2:20:19] IIRhynoII: riftmaker + morde top = gg
[2:20:19] xNocchi: Well it's sad you lost the game but at least we won some peas TwitchConHYPE
[2:20:24] proximamidnightx: @IIRhynoII full assassins then? how suprising -_-
[2:20:34] IIRhynoII: @proximamidnightx ikr
[2:20:43] mrshibasan: ngl I just played ahri a while ago and I was winning ang team end up lose for me
[2:20:49] arcadedani: yeah
[2:20:51] BabaaBear17: was the PBE thing not a preseason?
[2:21:06] BabaaBear17: or how does that work?
[2:21:09] BabaaBear17: oh ok lol
[2:21:12] BabaaBear17: sorry
[2:21:13] IIRhynoII: it was the supplement for the preseason
[2:21:16] curelinzzi: I cant believe lux is getting buffs
[2:21:20] 4braxis: Rito James
[2:21:21] ericaborgest: Hi friends kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[2:21:26] IIRhynoII: lux is D-tier rn
[2:21:28] ericaborgest: Happy Friday
[2:21:33] QTwinkyyy: It's honestly really sad but as soon as I saw the Vlad I knew to vote with the doubters. I'm sorry! :c
[2:21:36] xNocchi: Hey i got a redbull ad
[2:21:48] Johntrueman23: Hello @KayPea
[2:21:50] ladysithlord: they did a hotfix yesterday i patched after a game for like....5 minutes. it was weird.
[2:22:06] BabaaBear17: lux feels amazing as a support but as a midlaner I feel that I do nothing
[2:22:15] Niomah: merf work picking up, will be back later hopefully
[2:22:26] Sunnytinker: mord time?
[2:22:26] QTwinkyyy: Yeah I mean the Vlad literally banned the Fizz cause that was  the only possibility of being a threat to him
[2:22:46] timikn: Hi all kaypHello kaypHello  finally weekend
[2:22:46] IIRhynoII: she's actually better at mid than sup rn -- she's immobile so the extra gank lanes make her more vulnerable
[2:23:02] IIRhynoII: riftmaker
[2:23:04] xNocchi: Top again? I mean seriously
[2:23:15] Skurcz: Meaning being reasonable and coolheaded player will get you to a new heights ?
[2:23:20] ThirstyForJustice: Morde: Riftmaker, Rylai's, Lyandries
[2:23:23] proximamidnightx: will they do anything about tanks one shotting/huge damage adc and mages at least?
[2:23:26] IIRhynoII: Morde >> rylai's into riftmaker
[2:23:43] ObsceneSanity: morde is rylai -> riftmaker
[2:23:55] sovitiaisavampire: new heights? you get taller? Keepo
[2:24:05] penguminari0324: 2 top games in a row?
[2:24:07] Oakley85: @KayPea I would do rift, rylais and then jak'sho or however you spell that
[2:24:20] ThirstyForJustice: Riftmaker has the 2% bonus hp scaling. Rylai's and Liandries both have hp and the stats he wants
[2:24:21] Frozenfruit13: rylai into jak sho is the play I think
[2:24:23] xRaze87: Rylai, Liandries & Riftmaker
[2:24:26] IIRhynoII: 2% of bonus health into AP, but you build a tank item or two after riftmaker
[2:24:42] ObsceneSanity: rylai and rift are the only dmg items you probably build
[2:24:47] IIRhynoII: or AP items w/ health
[2:24:58] sabiirox: you can go riffmakeri and heartsteal?
[2:25:00] Frozenfruit13: jak sho jak sho jak sho
[2:25:02] ajak636: oh you changed your secondary role from bot to top now?
[2:25:15] ThirstyForJustice: You could go Abyssal Mask
[2:25:17] ObsceneSanity: oh no
[2:25:17] Galetea: ryalis - rift  - liandrys - jaksho
[2:25:20] Oakley85: @KayPea Jak'sho is health and then increases your resistances the longer you are in combat which is really strong
[2:25:23] Sunnytinker: no warmogs, you should do spirit visage
[2:25:25] ObsceneSanity: lissandra is gunna get smoked
[2:25:26] ThirstyForJustice: That's MR, HP, and MR debuff
[2:25:28] xRaze87: Liandries is kinda key on Morde now that demonic embrace is gone
[2:25:30] Waterhead30: This season is: build every previoua mythical item for easy win
[2:25:30] arcadedani: wait Liss against Kat?
[2:25:32] IIRhynoII: spirit visage 100%
[2:25:40] QTwinkyyy: You can do Jak'sho or Spirit visage both are really good
[2:25:42] ladysithlord: i went on an 8 game loss streak yesterday lol it was kinda insane
[2:25:44] Galetea: spirit vis yes
[2:25:50] BabaaBear17: where’s Lucas stream?
[2:25:51] xNocchi: I fool around and fell in love kaypLunaRage
[2:26:02] korbeenoxo: has there ever been the start of a season and people are like “good job riot”
[2:26:10] xNocchi: Love that song
[2:26:11] pedrito420: katarina top? what's happening? xD
[2:26:13] Sunnytinker: shield
[2:26:13] Galetea: shield
[2:26:16] Oakley85: Ring
[2:26:16] sabiirox: heartsteal no?
[2:26:16] Necrothia: i'd do shield
[2:26:16] Sunnytinker: ?
[2:26:18] IIRhynoII: ring
[2:26:27] Oakley85: oh maybe shield vs renekton
[2:26:29] ObsceneSanity: ring for dmg, sheild for sustain
[2:26:34] IIRhynoII: ^^
[2:26:38] Ezkhel: Curveball them with doran sword Kappa
[2:26:40] pedrito420: smash her
[2:26:41] arcadedani: @pedrito420 she is broken no matter which lane :v
[2:26:47] olson869: all you gotta do is bonk people

[2:32:03] MissMeerkat: new toplaner main inbound
[2:32:14] ajak636: the bonks tilted him
[2:32:18] Oakley85: Very unlikely you would need TP early so usually when you get a kill early like that its better to just reset and immediately TP back so you dont miss exp
[2:32:25] AhriYouKidding: damn miss @KayPea went from gracious lux to bulky morde
[2:32:27] w0wzors: You dont I dont know why they are suggesting it
[2:32:29] proximamidnightx: the crocodile just got pea bonked
[2:32:31] phreak43: rip all my pea points :)
[2:32:31] ThirstyForJustice: Yeah, you didn't need the TP early
[2:32:31] xBoomShotBaby: i dont think you needed to tp, no idea
[2:32:49] MissMeerkat: you did the best option imo
[2:32:52] Napping_Sab: now tP
[2:32:56] kaithegemini: Don't forget to heal with W when u get the chance :)

[2:34:00] catchingfire88: I like how he doesn't give up lol
[2:34:00] xNocchi: Omg who is shee
[2:34:01] Oakley85: @KayPea Tping when it was at the tower wasn't great but when you first got the kill normally people would just walk away and leave the wave as is and tp back immediately instead of pushing the wave and letting him freeze
[2:34:03] guiltyprawn: Renekton got bonked EZ Clap
[2:34:08] Jothor83: have no clue @IIRhynoII just done remember her playing morde , so was a wtf moment as i joined

[2:34:19] BlackBeard_Ac3: NVM just saw
[2:34:19] AhriYouKidding: @IIRhynoII is it?
[2:34:21] InoIngvar: TP is for when you have to go back fast to collect wave exp\gold. so if- wave hard pushing to you, frozen from you. other scenarios you should have enough tempo to walk back to lose only 2-3 minions. which is worth the tp in some scenarios
[2:34:23] IIRhynoII: @Jothor83 haha np, wasn't throwing shade
[2:34:23] ObsceneSanity: you should back and get a free buy
[2:34:52] MissMeerkat: jesus KEKW

[2:37:40] ObsceneSanity: yeah, but then you cant say yoink
[2:37:49] jadestarhumper: @BasedEGOR lol

[2:39:12] Razmeck: if only you did not take those 4 turret shots
[2:39:15] xNocchi: Does Morde's Q does crit damage when it hits a single target? 🤔
[2:39:15] Tritros: kaypNoted
[2:39:16] ericaborgest: now u tp lol
[2:39:24] ericaborgest: noice
[2:39:26] Nikodermos: the E before the q there might have been the play rather than q into e  with tower aggro ,
[2:39:30] IIRhynoII: haha
[2:39:40] xvenix: When u kite and forget there a turret there
[2:39:53] Nikodermos: still though 5-1 u should body the lane

[2:41:47] xNocchi: Don't worry, you'll scale 😌
[2:42:05] ObsceneSanity: i think on paper, rene wins that fight
[2:42:09] KinKaray: @FiveFM Oh, her brain is working properly. She's just passive agressive saying she can't play from behind
[2:42:15] KinKaray: LUL
[2:42:34] jareauu: she didn’t kill renek but she went inside that when it was already unnecessary lmao

[2:43:44] Kowdbuff: oof i dont evn wanna think about vlad with the new itmes, he was already gross when ahead
[2:43:50] ladysithlord: EVEN T1 doing his little climb to challenger... is having the same issue.
[2:44:00] J_to_the_jf: imagine a game giving out new items, new map, and new objectives right as a new season starts Kappa
[2:44:21] ObsceneSanity: @ladysithlord you know what i found wild about watching him, is how awful illaoi is now
[2:44:22] khadapys: I'm scared to play lol in new season o.0 rly!
[2:44:45] kaithegemini: Yeah if he rage W's you when you have ur shield up, he will cut it all down so yeah hold ur shield  until after he uses it
[2:44:52] IIRhynoII: u could go anathema's chains make renek ur nemesis
[2:45:02] IIRhynoII: get 650 health off of it too
[2:45:04] nicorasenpai: cait respects ur ult Kappa
[2:45:08] QTwinkyyy: Cleansed the ult but can't cleanse the after arrow! LMAO
[2:45:19] kingdomofblue: has anyone played vs nunu after map changes? legit cant get away from him unless you have flash
[2:45:23] Rago602: At least you can focus on ulting the others?
[2:45:32] kennydebest: what do you thiink of the new season map ?
[2:45:36] TurtleIam: steel caps
[2:45:39] ObsceneSanity: you start building armor here
[2:45:44] ericaborgest: anything with damage and armor
[2:45:45] nicorasenpai: yeah jaksho
[2:45:46] J_to_the_jf: nah cause there's an AP item that takes away your MR
[2:45:47] Rago602: Yeah you kinda need armor, but maybe sunfire, not jaksho
[2:45:50] Galetea: plated steel caps and jaksho yes
[2:45:50] IIRhynoII: frozen heart too
[2:45:57] ObsceneSanity: you should get jaksho, and sunfire/hollow
[2:46:09] kaithegemini: jak'sho would be good
[2:46:19] J_to_the_jf: guys new items negate jak'sho
[2:46:27] Cajjsa: were u autofilled? or what did i miss? KPOPheart
[2:46:31] Sonje: what about spirit visage for heal amp?
[2:46:38] IIRhynoII: @Cajjsa autofilled
[2:46:38] QTwinkyyy: I've seen a few higher ranked Morde players go Zhonya's so that's a possible option too
[2:46:47] Cajjsa: @IIRhynoII ahh i see
[2:46:51] Rago602: oh yeah actually zhonyas is much better
[2:46:54] Rago602: good point
[2:46:59] IIRhynoII: @Cajjsa she queued mid/bot
[2:47:03] J_to_the_jf: jak'sho MR is useless now with the new items it sucks
[2:47:13] Cajjsa: @IIRhynoII unlucky!
[2:47:14] KinKaray: Just kick Renekton from the game! Tell him his mom is calling for dinner time! KEKW
[2:47:23] IIRhynoII: jak'sho decent for sup tanks
[2:47:23] khadapys: your morde is big boi! :D
[2:47:24] J_to_the_jf: new item negates the entire jak'sho MR
[2:47:27] Sunnytinker: wouldnt spirit viasge will also helping with your shield
[2:47:29] sovitiaisavampire: LMAO
[2:47:29] Rago602: jaksho is just a bit weak without having other tank items imo
[2:47:32] Kowdbuff: lol she didnt even try to dodge
[2:47:35] sovitiaisavampire: she just accepted her fate
[2:47:39] Femuline: wait mordekaiser?? what have i walked into xD im living for it tho
[2:47:45] sovitiaisavampire: "all right just take me"
[2:47:48] ericaborgest: I would go sunfire

[2:48:16] Nikodermos: deathcap and void staff ?
[2:48:16] IIRhynoII: sunfire, frozen heart, spirit visage
[2:48:18] Sunnytinker: laindrys?
[2:48:19] nuclearr16: jaksho is decent still
[2:48:24] ObsceneSanity: sunfire is good. Xin, Rene, rakon, and kat are all melee champs
[2:48:29] kaithegemini: you got enough innate damage to go full tank now
[2:48:32] nicorasenpai: i think jaksho + sunfire would be good + plated
[2:48:33] ThirstyForJustice: Randuin's and Spirit Visage
[2:48:37] Sunnytinker: wouldn't liandrys be good
[2:48:41] ThirstyForJustice: Randuin's will help against Cait
[2:48:43] weareblob: hullbreaker?
[2:48:51] J_to_the_jf: I'd go nasher and sunfire
[2:48:51] Nikodermos: healing and its shield % increase
[2:48:58] Nikodermos: both high value for morde
[2:48:59] FiveFM: Sunfire does make you more tanky AND burny when they’re close to you!
[2:49:32] J_to_the_jf: her second itme

[2:49:44] Kowdbuff: stormsurge is gross
[2:49:49] J_to_the_jf: these new items are broken as fuck
[2:49:59] IIRhynoII: i'd go frozen heart, their strongest champs are ad
[2:50:12] J_to_the_jf: it's the season of the mage!
[2:50:19] Rago602: frozen heart loses a lot of value without mana imo
[2:50:20] IIRhynoII: no bonus health tho
[2:50:24] weareblob: no mana
[2:50:36] Sonje: there are also these two new items unending despair and hollow radiance I went for these on maokai supp and was really hard to kill
[2:50:40] athousandbonerz: Gargoyle?? Is that still a thing?
[2:50:49] IIRhynoII: u get 400 mana from frozen heart
[2:51:03] Rago602: @athousandbonerz nope xd
[2:51:17] cactuspaste: it's stormsurge, it deals sneaky damage
[2:52:01] TurtleIam: match making
[2:52:05] Galetea: it didnt even look like your ult went around the wall whaa
[2:52:06] IIRhynoII: wait, nvm lol wow i'm....lol just nvm

[2:52:36] aside_sue: the audacity of kat to type in all chat LMAO
[2:52:41] nicorasenpai: soraka havin a hard time lol
[2:52:48] aside_sue: embarassing
[2:53:01] Galetea: smacked her with grey screen
[2:53:03] ObsceneSanity: unending despair might be good for morde right?
[2:53:18] kaithegemini: vi and liss job is to interruopt kat ult tbh

[2:55:53] el_cris_06: btw how are ap items right now?
[2:55:58] cactuspaste: and that's why stormsurge is getting nerfed right away
[2:56:09] nicorasenpai: if liss cant use ult on kat, soraka should hold her E for kat ult
[2:56:20] ObsceneSanity: liss did and she used it on the wrong target
[2:56:26] kaithegemini: even soraka silence will stop her
[2:56:32] 0VincentRayne0: pantheon needs to be hella nerfed right away. dude was one shotting my fed adc while being 2/6/2 with only one item LUL
[2:56:43] 0VincentRayne0: oh, and that's support panth btw
[2:56:46] shamneo: ashe ult
[2:56:51] nicorasenpai: ashe ult if will hit
[2:56:51] Sonje: ahe ult
[2:57:04] Kowdbuff: you guys basically have an anti-kat comp lol, she should be getting dunpstered
[2:57:52] Smoothcollie: Well this game wasn't the game
[2:58:00] ajak636: vi q and your e too
[2:58:13] Napping_Sab: she was tilted from the start
[2:58:13] nicorasenpai: 5/1 to 9/7 is so balanced riot
[2:58:17] cactuspaste: the thing is, the ammount of burst she's dealing makes it almost imposible to react to, at least that happened to me yesterday againts a le blanc
[2:58:24] 0VincentRayne0: people are hella not taking accountability so far this season
[2:58:52] proximamidnightx: @0VincentRayne0 when they even did lmao
[2:58:54] 0VincentRayne0: i believe matchmaking is starting from the ground up again
[2:58:56] IIRhynoII: i'm just surprised top is autofilling, thought it was most popular role
[2:59:00] proximamidnightx: its almost someone else's fault
[2:59:00] 0VincentRayne0: hence why it seems fcked right now
[2:59:03] LinhPatinh: !opgg

[2:59:04] Chifuyune: Hello! So happy to see ya. kaypInLove
[2:59:04] wolterbrm2021: games have been iffy for me too tbh
[2:59:05] nicorasenpai: is this the cursed acc eu version
[2:59:05] Paatzi: games have been soooo rough lately, i can't ...
[2:59:09] georgo__: I went 0-5 in placements, started the season with 0- 7 :D
[2:59:09] Nikodermos: destined for iron on this account
[2:59:13] Smoothcollie: Clearly loser queue. Im
[2:59:15] wolterbrm2021: had like 1 iron and another troll pick feeder
[2:59:19] frankenfoot5: I feel like players are all still being sorted to their appropriate ranks, so teams are super volatile and its just a coin flip right now
[2:59:21] 0VincentRayne0: @proximamidnightx last two seasons for me i didn't get this level of consistent toxicity for the past 2 years
[2:59:29] Nikodermos: irons not as bad as ppl make out
[2:59:36] Chifuyune: !rank
[2:59:36] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=No+Cannon+No+Cry%23pea%2CKarma+Pengu
[2:59:38] Razmeck: @KayPea TBH this is very common for most games right now....if you want to win...you have to play what broken right now
[2:59:42] patty_goddess: hi kay p
[2:59:44] 0VincentRayne0: the matchmaking system is infinitely better. it just needs time to cook
[2:59:51] patty_goddess: what rank u get?
[2:59:51] Napping_Sab: yesterday i went 1 win and 3 loses and it was againt bullshit like TF ADC with a machine gun cause of the attack speed items
[3:00:00] Galetea: it feels like they're putting you on teams that need a carry but its not putting you in mid where you can do anything
[3:00:09] IIRhynoII: at least until the patch hits
[3:00:11] nicorasenpai: my friend went 0-5 in placement and they are emerald IV last season guess where they land GOLD 1...
[3:00:23] ObsceneSanity: there is a bunch of inflated stormsurge gamers out there climbing that will probably drop after the nerf
[3:00:28] H34dSHooTT: yeeez 0-4
[3:00:36] 0VincentRayne0: @nicorasenpai that's impossible LUL
[3:00:40] IIRhynoII: placements work so that you pick up where you left off if you go 5-0 in placements
[3:00:40] Chaot1cX: Welcome to league :D
[3:00:54] steelkore: spinaCozy spinaCozy spinaCozy
[3:00:58] proximamidnightx: i will call the cops if you get top again???
[3:01:12] 0VincentRayne0: i went 1-4 and i started only a few points away from my rank where i left off last season
[3:01:12] ObsceneSanity: with the new items, and it may be just not knowing what to do, but people are not respecting the power creep that the new items introduced
[3:01:22] butterflyeffecttt3: Hello kp! I need to say i think Morgana kinda looked like you in The cinematic haha
[3:01:25] coifmonkeey: are there any broken adc's yet?
[3:01:40] ObsceneSanity: @coifmonkeey yeah, ap champs
[3:01:45] 0VincentRayne0: powerspikes are so random right now

[3:02:54] Smoothcollie: Loser queue, 100 % Sadly nothing u can do with it
[3:02:58] Kowdbuff: is renaming all the players an anti-sniping thing they added? i dont rememebr that being there when i last played

[3:03:44] butterflyeffecttt3: Being out The Pro irelia
[3:03:44] 0VincentRayne0: @Kowdbuff it's to keep people from searching others up on OP.GG and dodging just because their match history is doodoo water
[3:03:47] guiltyprawn: Been aram'ing. Gotta say, i understood what you meant with "mage items" being way more op on melee champs BUT I DIDNT EXPECT SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE Monkas

[3:05:41] timikn: you should start a prediction before next game for us to pick a chance of you getting a top
[3:05:43] IIRhynoII: vanguard, yes
[3:05:50] Nikodermos: "working as intended"
[3:05:54] liobanil: what what
[3:05:55] IIRhynoII: CAN. NOT. WAIT. for vanguard
[3:06:01] bemyresset: I DIDNT KNOW THIS WAS A THING OMG
[3:06:03] thelunarqueen666: what exactly happened?
[3:06:04] DontFreakMeOut: Wait how does it work? O.o
[3:06:08] butterflyeffecttt3: Huhhh
[3:06:09] guiltyprawn: What's Vanguard?
[3:06:10] IIRhynoII: low elo scripts were insane last season
[3:06:11] AutumnReds: i have never seen that before
[3:06:12] shamneo: didnt know this
[3:06:12] catttini: did PBE the other day and it pre checked to ensure i could run vanguard. can't wait
[3:06:14] nicorasenpai: emerald - challenger has a tons of scripters
[3:06:15] kaithegemini: huh
[3:06:16] 0VincentRayne0: yeah, the amount of bots i remember seeing was so damn annoying
[3:06:16] LGNDARYAssassin: im confused why vanguard wasnt in this patch
[3:06:17] daddybubbles2: when is vanguard being implemented?
[3:06:22] sovitiaisavampire: top all day long lmao
[3:06:23] arcadedani: that's stupid
[3:06:26] sovitiaisavampire: thanks rito
[3:06:27] 0VincentRayne0: Vanguard is heavily needed
[3:06:28] IIRhynoII: scripts and bots were running rampant in s13
[3:06:31] liobanil: and do you lose lp?
[3:06:33] ladysithlord: i got that yesterdya and was so confused
[3:06:33] IIRhynoII: ^^
[3:06:37] ObsceneSanity: i know this is unpopular opinion but i dont think there should be a dodge penalty
[3:06:38] chibiokamii: holy smokes Batman that’s crazy
[3:06:39] bemyresset: I think it’s on PBE right?
[3:06:43] nicorasenpai: vanguard is not even safe in valorant- Kappa
[3:06:43] bemyresset: so hopefully soon…
[3:06:47] IIRhynoII: @liobanil no, the script makes it to where you don't lose lp
[3:06:49] 0VincentRayne0: bot is a priority role isn't it?
[3:06:52] Nikodermos: not to ruin the mood but ppl defn script down into iron too
[3:06:52] arcadedani: but either way i think is for the better the dodge because your mid whas the same Rengar ass from the Cassio top game
[3:06:53] IIRhynoII: and no dodge timer
[3:06:55] bemyresset: it’s better than nothing tho
[3:06:59] sovitiaisavampire: GUILTY WENT ALL IN WITH 3000

[3:18:29] ObsceneSanity: fun fact for any adc players: Red Side bot lane, you can be ganked from behind for free. Tower doesnt catch them
[3:18:49] Sunnytinker: KayPea the cheerleader this game kaypCheer
[3:18:53] 0VincentRayne0: most of this early season seems to be all about mental
[3:19:10] 0VincentRayne0: so many people troll and int. and that alone causes teams losses rather than skill gaps
[3:19:26] Smoothcollie: kaypVibe kaypVibe kaypVibe kaypVibe

[3:30:29] fate_unchanged: *it heals herself and nearest ally basically is what i mean, oops
[3:30:51] ObsceneSanity: you have no armor pen yet
[3:30:56] AutumnReds: kayle judges you super hard when she heals you thought.
[3:31:02] J_to_the_jf: I literally just had a person in my game say in all chat "I did my best to fuck you over this game" I got money Riot does NOTHING about it KEKW

[3:36:05] elenawoo: @ajak636 preeech
[3:36:09] MiyukiKowa: is quinn building armor pen?

[3:38:19] fate_unchanged: quinn loves popping that ignite while someone's full hp, i respect the anti heal dedication
[3:38:41] 0VincentRayne0: the terrain level on this map is definitely affecting skillshots a little bit.
[3:39:17] SquirrelMaster61985: also asol hitbox is janky af
