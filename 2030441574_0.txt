[0:53:33] NothHellNoaKnight: @MKanalyst only thing it will be ok to build for ornn is sundered sky rly good against him
[0:53:42] NothHellNoaKnight: but yeah building to kill ornn is dumb
[0:53:50] haidgu: why not cleaver? @NothHellNoaKnight
[0:53:56] NothHellNoaKnight: just accept boring lane
[0:53:59] vaporphonix: playlist?
[0:54:07] MpraWins: Eclipse is good as well since he deals magic and you gain good shield
[0:54:10] MKanalyst: u dont build vs orn, especially when rest of enemy team are paper champs
[0:54:12] NothHellNoaKnight: bcs you dont need cleaver in game in general
[0:54:18] NothHellNoaKnight: item is shit rn
[0:54:29] haidgu: so even vs tanks team]
[0:54:38] haidgu: better to just only get eclipse + sundered sky and usual other items?
[0:54:39] haidgu: that's crazy
[0:54:48] MKanalyst: its not boring lane, its free lane, since u ignore him and proxy and roam and have 3x more impact than staying on lane :)

[0:54:52] LoLRankBot: rivenvayne is Master  44 LP
[0:54:53] haidgu: burt yea the decreased % armor reduction is cringe
[0:54:59] Runecrown: Eh, you can get away with cleaver if there are armor stackers in more than one lane but its still niche atm and doesnt stand out vs Eclipse, Shojin, and Sundered.
[0:55:04] NothHellNoaKnight: there is no such thing as tanks team and shojin eclipse sunderer alows you to kill enemy carrys and then tanks dont do shit

[0:55:38] curlythepube: now he lose cs to turret?
[0:55:52] VietSteak: @curlythepube cuz orrn has tp with only 5s death timer - ornn could have easily killed him
[0:55:54] winnablepoggers: @curlythepube Tempo... he lost like 3 minons..
[0:55:55] danielshx: @curlythepube bait or rlly question?
[0:55:59] GenghisKlown: GenghisKlown watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! !
[0:56:08] timmyb44: He freezes wave bro
[0:56:12] MKanalyst: @curlythepube cuz orn TPs and freezes and viper would lose 2-3 waves
[0:56:14] Palapam: @curlythepube he cant contest wave with 1/3 hp
[0:56:27] Runecrown: @haidgu Indeed. Ive seen different routes depending on the game. Some are goign Shojin Rush in a lane for Early leads. Others going Sundered Rush if there is a lot of roaming skirmishes going on early.

[0:58:22] Runecrown: @jaxinsux Indeed. Its Core regardless of 1st or 2nd build. I do agree. I think Shojin and Sunder outshine Eclipse in the 1st or second spot. Its just an observation looking across different Riven players.
[0:58:25] NothHellNoaKnight: the only thing i dont like in current riven build is rushing shojin, i know cdr is like most important for riven but unique effects of eclipse and sundered too tasty

[1:47:13] Epytt: meanwhile +20....
[1:47:14] MpraWins: Ye maybe lower mmr acc was the play but idk
[1:47:21] AnyaLoveDucks: @rocketmatbu there is a way to combine CDR + lethality /// conqueror + domination (sudden impact + ingeniuos hunter)  1st profane hydra, 2nd youmuu. This build gives you cd reduction in items, so you can spam tiamat and youmuus, you don't need ulti to oneshot each cd reset in items. Already GM in LAN 84% winrate as riven

[5:08:18] Pr0Acid: ez vayne
[5:08:19] bob493: i dont think its targeted, riven's being played by a few of the top players atm
[5:08:25] theyellowtoucan: riven banned everytime
[5:08:29] bob493: or not "specifically" targeted
[5:08:56] mosolaticanoo: its just too much riven picker in na right
[5:09:14] bob493: id say more a few players specialize in it so hard its not worth playing against
[5:09:20] Ayyyvi: YES
[5:09:24] Ayyyvi: U KNOW IT
[5:09:26] Ayyyvi: I KNOW IT
[5:09:30] vaporphonix: irelia
[5:10:07] saphi32: so its Shojin first ?
[5:10:09] Article1: is riven that bad that shes everyones permaban? im late to the season
[5:10:55] Latrion: Not Kassadin level, but def a strong champ
[5:11:08] borderjumpah: @Article1 nah shes not broken its just that vipers playing her a lot and the guy thats snum 2(?) on the ladder rn is also a riv 1 trick
[5:11:21] Nightbot: Sub to the stream if you want to see me stream everyday and to support my journey of full time streaming! Thank you and enjoy
[5:11:31] nxtrl: I over slept @Viper i hope you learn to forgive me one day T.T
[5:12:23] bob493: @Article1  its more that zyzzy and viper have a 70+% winrate on her at the moment lol. With these players "Racing" each other, i cant imagine they want to let it slide through
[5:12:58] T1Tesko: @nxtrl you shall be forgiven
[5:13:35] Ozube: how does getting 1st to challenger work
[5:13:50] T1Tesko: I think you hit 500lp or something probably
[5:14:08] andr3p344: Imo sometimes we can do eclipse bc new hydra after hotfix guys
[5:14:17] andr3p344: Dmg will be fkin insane
[5:14:20] lolkotek: whatcha watchin during queues
[5:14:26] kylerarc: very squishy tho
[5:14:43] andr3p344: Yes but not that different from now
[5:14:44] Nightbot: https://www.danteschallenge.com/
[5:14:52] kylerarc: i like hydra alot but its not the best i just have fun with the item
[5:15:03] Viper: im just watching other streamers that are also in the challenge
[5:15:15] andr3p344: True but have u seen the hotfix?
[5:15:17] lord44me: !race
[5:15:18] Nightbot: https://www.danteschallenge.com/
[5:15:37] kylerarc: for rav? no what is it
[5:15:42] kylerarc: i been doing hw
[5:15:45] andr3p344: Not ravenous hydra
[5:15:50] andr3p344: Lethality one
[5:15:58] kylerarc: profane?
[5:15:59] bob493: @Ozube challenger is minimum 500lp, but you have to keep it for the whole update cycle
[5:16:01] andr3p344: Yes
[5:16:08] kylerarc: what did they do
[5:16:10] bob493: so once the ladder updates, then whoever is over 500 gets promoted
[5:16:14] bob493: at first
[5:16:21] kylerarc: the reason i like rav is because ah, sustain, wave clear
[5:16:34] andr3p344: The hotfix for ravenous is usless only 2% more lifesteal
[5:16:37] bob493: ravenous is getting 2% lifesteal buff
[5:16:45] andr3p344: Wich imo does not fix is problem rn
[5:16:51] bob493: and 100 gold cheaper, which isnt awful
[5:16:53] kylerarc: maybe reduce cost
[5:17:04] andr3p344: Profane will cost now 3300 so like the others
[5:17:06] kylerarc: yeah i mean i alreaddy like the item but its not the best people decided on eclipse
[5:17:11] Nightbot: Subscribe to my YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbhTDvxYDkkhDDZG6PGSV3A Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/hiitsviper tiktok : https://www.tiktok.com/@viper_riven
[5:17:18] kylerarc: i just get dopamine from riven wave clear with hydra lmfao
[5:17:21] bob493: @andr3p344 they are removing the casting delay as well; but i have no idea how much that will matter, if at all
[5:17:26] ScumbagSorelio: Lifesteal: 10% ⇒ 12% Cast Time: 0.25 seconds ⇒ Now references user’s auto attack cast time
[5:17:31] andr3p344: But the attive now scale 100%ad and the second part up to 150% ad
[5:17:41] kylerarc: whats azhys opgg
[5:17:43] benjatiarg: akali game?
[5:17:47] bob493: yeah that item got a proper buff
[5:18:11] andr3p344: Ye I can see going that 3rd or 2nd if snowballing
[5:18:13] kylerarc: oh he really trying some builds out lmfao
[5:18:19] nxtrl: @bob493 its also getting its animation faster
[5:18:21] nxtrl: which is nice
[5:18:30] andr3p344: Eclipse first still a fucking must
[5:18:42] chasethewindd: !race
[5:18:42] Nightbot: https://www.danteschallenge.com/
[5:18:48] bob493: @nxtrl a dubious change unless it impacts animations
[5:18:50] tofudriver13954: EDM
[5:18:57] chasethewindd: damn I didnt know Pentaless is a 20 year old college student
[5:19:00] andr3p344: But definitely eclipse profane when ur going good u will def melt the fuck out of people
[5:19:01] bob493: simon patterson is amazing lol
[5:19:06] nxtrl: @bob493 yes it impacts animation like profane
[5:19:08] kylerarc: @andr3p344 what does eclipse give over rav? ik everyone likes it more
[5:19:12] nxtrl: its actually a good change
[5:19:17] Epytt: They gonna make animatiom from 0.25s to 0.2
[5:19:25] bob493: well it still has a cast, its just tied to your attack speed now
[5:19:33] andr3p344: @kylerarc the crazy part is the cost
[5:19:40] bob493: which again, leads to being adubious change lol
[5:19:42] ScumbagSorelio: I mean, the profance active got like 50% dmg increase, thats quite a lot
[5:19:43] nxtrl: @Epytt false from .2 to attack wind up timer now
[5:19:43] kylerarc: cheaper, shield vs 5 ah, proc dmg, wave clear, sustain
[5:19:45] andr3p344: @kylerarc plus the dmg of the passive
[5:20:09] Epytt: @nxtrl oh they changed it again
[5:20:18] andr3p344: @kylerarc like I started longsword and I just needed 2450 for eclipse
[5:20:36] kylerarc: true the spike is really good
[5:20:41] nxtrl: @andr3p344 why not start pickaxe and only need 1925?
[5:20:44] andr3p344: Once i got it my dmg was insane i felt like i could 1 v1 veveryhting
[5:20:48] iM_UnTouChaBLeZ: was cupic in the race?
[5:20:53] ScumbagSorelio: no
[5:20:57] Epytt: No

[6:23:13] ssking100: man what is this darius doing
[6:23:19] bob493: @Acid_Mochi doesnt change anything, you can use w to cancel it, but thats irrelevant to cast time anyway
[6:23:35] HeelToeShift: this guy is a darius main too, hes playing like a filled support top
[6:23:38] HeelToeShift: wtf

[6:26:58] Nightbot: https://www.danteschallenge.com/
[6:27:09] lgiohl: @tenebris0281 I think he does sundered sky against darius because he needs to kill him fast but idk
[6:27:11] Rossko23: The Sundered cd is apparently buggy atm sometimes too?
[6:27:36] bob493: yea, I was having issues with it today; like my hits werent critting like it was still on cooldown or something
[6:27:55] Skoelly: vipeJAM vipeRAVE vipeJAM vipeRAVE vipeDab
[6:28:02] Rossko23: I like that it showcases crit animations for champs we don't see often

[6:29:21] Rossko23: Would just be the same as having any sort of crit roll, no? Just auto makes it 0
[6:29:40] bob493: no i mean like Q will automatically auto if youre in range, but it doesnt
[6:29:49] Runecrown: vipeJAM
[6:29:53] Rossko23: Aw fair
[6:29:58] bob493: like it just doesnt work sometimes, so im wondering if the e messes with it internally
[6:30:06] kmetananaroda1: @lgiohl no it is not haha
[6:30:16] Rossko23: We do love spaghetti code
[6:30:28] bob493: i mean on paper its a great item for her
[6:30:33] bob493: just didnt have that "feely feel"
[6:30:55] inbajungler: hydra got buf chat ?
[6:31:01] bob493: kinda
[6:31:17] bob493: ravenous got 2% extra lifesteal and is 100 gold cheaper, which is nice
[6:31:22] jaxinsux: hel l no
[6:31:23] danitos972: nerf... it doesn't proc with abilities
[6:31:25] jaxinsux: hydra sucks now
[6:31:26] bob493: the animation change doesnt do that much
[6:31:29] jaxinsux: dnt build it
[6:31:34] FoilsArt_: Rumble is so disgusting now
[6:31:43] xfreefer: that was a little too crazy
[6:31:44] jaxinsux: always has been
[6:31:51] mark02: The one game we don't ban rumble
[6:31:53] mark02: Sadge
[6:31:55] slajders1: I mean every ap champion is disgusting right now
[6:32:08] xfreefer: LOL that rumble dmg
[6:32:08] bob493: im not sure if "sucks" is the right word; 70 ad, 20 AH, 12 life steal is pretty decent in this kinda kit haha; the active also is nice for conqueror stacks
[6:32:10] xDrew11: Yeah Mordekaiser is a monster as well
[6:32:10] Rossko23: Gundam goblin
[6:32:27] Rossko23: Morde is actually nuts
[6:32:28] jaxinsux: @bob493 then build it in ur games lol
[6:32:30] jaxinsux: it sucks
[6:32:33] bob493: k
[6:32:34] bob493: lol
[6:32:38] bob493: not sure what that has to do with anything i said
[6:32:45] inbajungler: I agree maybe is playable now on riven
[6:32:56] bob493: how about this
[6:33:05] acekiritou: !race
[6:33:05] Nightbot: https://www.danteschallenge.com/
[6:33:06] bob493: @jaxinsux  care to explain "why" it sucks? in objective terms
[6:33:18] bob493: ill listen
[6:33:29] mark02: there are just better items
[6:33:31] andr3p344: I will explain
[6:33:35] jaxinsux: thanks
[6:33:36] notlaff: its an adc mid gap
[6:33:40] andr3p344: It does not sucks
[6:33:50] xDrew11: If your low elo just play Morde jungle and go bully enemy jungler.
[6:33:52] andr3p344: But cost too much
[6:34:05] notlaff: Ok Pog
[6:34:05] mark02: got that rumblebounty
[6:34:07] mark02: its over now
[6:34:09] spydermang: BIG
[6:34:13] EpicBaller72: +1000 EZ
[6:34:15] ssking100: can win
[6:34:17] jaxinsux: its too expensive, omnivamp was better than lifesteal, and it lost the passive that primarily made it such a good item
[6:34:25] yutipa: yeah true, id buy hydra if it costed 2k!
[6:34:27] Amaresu_: i m not saying there s only 10 broken champs but how the fuck does rumble get through bans
[6:34:33] Amaresu_: he s literally best champ in game 2 years in a row
[6:34:47] Rossko23: The skin is half the reason for it too
[6:34:49] jucy_juske: enemy full towers lol
[6:34:50] bob493: i mean it hasnt had omnivamp for 2 years lol
[6:34:52] silent_saanya: Does the "ingenius Hunter" runes reduce the passive cd on Sundered sky? or only the shield cd on Eclipse?
[6:34:59] bob493: yes it does
[6:35:01] xDrew11: @amaresu_ I don't see him played that often.
[6:35:20] Amaresu_: @xDrew11 idk what elo you are but in high elo on all servers its pick/ban
[6:35:21] andr3p344: @bob493 tru but old cleave was healing anywya
[6:35:25] andr3p344: Anyway*
[6:35:31] yutipa: @bob493 it did have heal off cleave and cleave worked on abilitirs and now it doesnt so now main source of riven dmg doesnt have lifesteal.
[6:35:39] bob493: thats fair
[6:35:39] giadrome8998: I am so mad they gutted my secondary (Gwen) After her being good for like 2 days, while Rumble remains turbo broken like the last 10 months
[6:35:42] xDrew11: Ah yeah I'm Gold lol 😂 never see the dude
[6:35:53] bang_bros_1: joever

[6:36:35] Sanicspeedz: thats y they dont nerf him ig bc hes high elo skewed
[6:36:39] andr3p344: @bob493 the thing is that eclipse exist so u gotta choose between that or the hydra and eclipse is better spyke
[6:36:40] CinterJake: ap champs, can they pls get next patch asap?`
[6:36:46] yutipa: @jaxinsux id say ad stavks are secondary here. rn its just ad + haste for riven and its not worth
[6:36:47] CinterJake: im losing my head
[6:36:57] Rossko23: Well I'm Emerald and he still stomps no matter what

[6:37:28] Rossko23: I'm just glad Hullbreaker Yone is a thing of the past
[6:37:31] bob493: @yutipa the cleave heal makes infinitely more sense than discussing omnivamp and an active that hasnt been on it for 2 years lol
[6:37:31] xDrew11: Nah leave morde alone I might get carried out of gold for the first time ever
[6:37:46] Termiinal: yo hubris + profane buffs seem kinda crazy together
[6:37:47] giadrome8998: Kek
[6:37:48] Rossko23: Put him 0/9 but he sidelanes anyway, it's like an edgier Sion
[6:37:48] xDrew11: Hullbreaker period was dumb
[6:38:05] toxicevelynnn: what's the 9/20 about?
[6:38:06] yutipa: @bob493 yrah so thats basically the reason. everything elsr adds up, but this one is main.
[6:38:15] Runecrown: @toxicevelynnn Subgoal
[6:38:21] bob493: lot of combat power in being a drain tank
[6:38:45] bob493: fiora still benefits fully from lifesteal on her abilities (minus q) so that makes sense why she still builds it
[6:38:46] maslt: duckass
[6:38:50] lucediferro: why not call yourself RIVAYNE
[6:38:51] Rossko23: Liandries giving hp again is so great

[6:39:38] Thewazek: *
[6:39:38] yutipa: @bob493 well, kinda, but id say this item is shit on fiora since omnivamp removal so she doesnt heal from vitals. fiora is overall weaker thank god.
[6:39:46] squishgfx: duckass  hands on ya knees
[6:39:47] toxicevelynnn: @xDrew11 agreed, this zoomer music is just bad
[6:39:53] squishgfx: duckass  let that coochie breath
[6:39:56] bob493: yeah shes not feeling good; but itemization is still being "discussed" lol
[6:39:56] CinterJake: Singed 57% with liandrys XD
[6:40:06] bob493: triforce definitely doesnt have that "kick" that it used to
[6:40:08] kylerarc: what fiora change?

[6:58:39] bob493: @Rossko23 that "bonus damage" doesnt seem like it does anything other than eating a turret shot lol
[6:58:57] bob493: which I guess can make a dive better, but the damage is meaningless
[6:59:11] Rossko23: Legit, unless you get 5 or 6 for the lil homies
[6:59:17] Rossko23: But even then..
[6:59:20] bob493: they basically work like the belveth raymora things

[7:03:58] 404TheExile: lifesteal 10 -> 12 and faster active
[7:04:20] slajders1: Does the 2 lifesteal make a big difference tho ?
[7:04:37] 404TheExile: not sure but i take it
[7:04:38] DodgyGaming667: nah but active speed does
[7:04:48] slajders1: Whats the cd now
[7:05:01] bob493: I just realized something; riot somehow added new items without indirectly breaking yone and yasuo lol
[7:05:03] 404TheExile: u can check spideraxe30 on X (twitter) he posted all changes i think
[7:05:04] DodgyGaming667: it still needs more stats for its gold price though
[7:05:05] bob493: thats definitely a first
[7:05:12] slajders1: Ok ty
[7:05:22] Rossko23: Aw man ADC Yasuo is so fun rn tho
[7:05:28] 404TheExile: wenshen is rank1 super server with hydra rush and i can tell u it feels good
[7:05:50] bob493: @Rossko23 lol just mean they didnt screw the whole meta because they broke them. Remember rage blade a couple years ago?

[7:06:46] 404TheExile: @slajders1 u can always check in your client if hydra lifesteal is 10 or 12, so u know
[7:06:53] bob493: "leblanc - auto attack range 550 -> 450"
[7:06:54] bob493: boom

[7:07:24] bob493: @mangarelli1 slippery minx lol; her q is an auto reset and well.. crits still crit
[7:07:24] Rossko23: @mangarelli1 she can hit you for big damage but you can't hit her back
[7:07:25] gegovski27: @bob493 is that leblanc build viable tho? i feel like when i played it i did 0 damage later on
[7:07:32] Mikeykeaz: OH BABY BABY!!!!!!
[7:07:47] Amaresu_: @mangarelli1 she doesnt have to use W for damage so she can only use it for mobility and never be caught
[7:07:49] slajders1: @404TheExile So ur saying hydra into shojin is good now ? ill try it tommorow
[7:07:57] Amaresu_: @mangarelli1 and just be annoying. she counters all melee champs in game.
[7:08:00] RsDFS: banger
[7:08:02] bob493: @gegovski27 i have no idea how shes fairing on 14.1; devs still think it was too strong to hot nerf it so its probably "fine"
[7:08:05] 404TheExile: @slajders1 it is
[7:08:05] Rossko23: Reminds me, the new AD TF changes look bonkers
[7:08:39] 404TheExile: @slajders1 its the closest feeling / gameplay to last season

[8:57:24] Amaresu_: @HugmeIRL lane isnt so cancer. you can pressure her really early but if you fk up its over cause you re riven aka no sustain champ
[8:57:32] Amaresu_: its after lane that she makes you not able to play the game.
[8:57:45] HugmeIRL: yea right
[8:57:46] Amaresu_: and i mean yeah she has to be boosted to die to you so you re not gonna snowball off her in lane, thats a given.
[8:57:48] HugmeIRL: maybe i shouldn't contest lvl 1?
[8:57:54] Amaresu_: nah you can kill her lvl 1
[8:57:59] Amaresu_: go watch this game lvl 1 replay on vod
[8:58:02] Amaresu_: viper got his flash.

[8:59:08] Amaresu_: viper forced his flash w/ ignite
[8:59:16] Amaresu_: burn his boneplating and w and re-engage
[8:59:35] Amaresu_: if she tried to fight him more he d kill w/ flash but yeah

[9:05:54] wurdone: This singed champ is so dumb
[9:05:56] Amaresu_: riven was banned by enemy team
[9:06:02] Izkid7: @Amaresu_ aha ty
[9:06:40] Izkid7: did they removed all maximum percentage health damage items ? black clever no longer affects higher health enemys  and eclipse tho
[9:07:00] Amaresu_: burn items and ldr are still in game ig
[9:07:15] Izkid7: yea but ldr for adc's :#
[9:07:22] Izkid7: you cant use it for riven
[9:07:24] Amaresu_: yup
[9:07:40] Amaresu_: you either go lethality w/ serylda or sundered shojin cleaver (but you ll still be way worse than last ssn)
[9:07:42] Izkid7: they aiming to make adc's life more vaulue
[9:08:11] Izkid7: @Amaresu_ true

[9:08:39] Amaresu_: wouldnt be going 0/10 every game if they did
[9:08:49] Izkid7: @silentdraw_ like team should peel the adc to not get killed vs a tank or higher health enemy's
[9:08:55] Amaresu_: what is this singed champion btw
[9:08:59] Amaresu_: since when does he oneshot
[9:09:01] silentdraw_: @Amaresu_ just what i thought
[9:09:05] Izkid7: they nerfed him lmao
[9:09:29] Amaresu_: @Izkid7 yes mate but problem is in soloq you have to 1v9, there s no teamplay. so if you dont play adc you cant kill tanks ever?
[9:09:32] Amaresu_: thats bullshit
[9:09:39] Amaresu_: play adc or quit league ig nice company
[9:10:05] yousri01: Ap items all have pen it seems

[12:52:48] Astete69: !challenge

[12:53:13] SrMolinv: Viper have you seen Profane Hydra and Hubris buffs?
[12:53:26] Eifprinter: jg queue times are also way different from top @Viper

[12:54:38] nxtrl: @Viper nice to hear ur voice pal
[12:54:49] brandii: how are the games vipes
[12:55:02] bonksnark12: @viper my Fizz and stormsurged is getting nerfed in patch 14.1 hotfix
