[2:27:37] SaintBobby: but that was a reworked ult, his release ult was similar to the current one, no?
[2:27:53] DannyPoi: you mean the new ult he got that got reverted bakc to the old ult that he has now?
[2:27:58] doppelganger613: not better W max for clear speed?
[2:28:04] TheLongstrider: he looks like a strong Casper , The Ghost

[2:31:44] fizzkaleefa: @Nightblue3 i tried most of the gank junglers and they all have slow clear speed, bami just dont hit like it use to and if you are behind or squishy as tank you are useless
[2:31:46] downtoya: xin strongest jungler in the game though
[2:31:48] fizzkaleefa: tank*
[2:31:51] kappa3600: just don't kill herald only kill the things that spawn and fight around him and you get +1 to like 8 of them ?
[2:31:53] random_pj: @Nightblue3  have u tried rengar already
[2:31:56] iczzyata: is hect tank jg?
[2:32:03] sncwy_g: maybe building one tanky ap item first is the play
[2:32:05] WiltingWisteria: i feel like theres too much neutral objective pressure to play a lot of tank junglers now, early skirmishers fighting over grubs and rift will shine

[2:34:06] MasterSodaLol: invading seems pretty good now, also very annoying
[2:34:29] vonrazzle: Surely tank jungles do need to have some sort of downside, tanks shouldn't be able to fulfil tanking/cc AND DPS roles all at once

[2:36:41] kappa3600: why you don't use map cover ?
[2:36:43] podyon777: herald look huge now
[2:36:43] PREFONTAlNE: zac doesn’t need farm. he just needs level 6 and then good ganks
[2:36:47] WiltingWisteria: shelly way harder to solo now since she applies to a damage debuff
[2:36:49] fastghost99: Nothing counters illaoi
[2:36:55] dalfaro90: @nightblue3 I think the riding herald mechanic will be removed don't you? Too for fun ppl can't drive well
[2:36:57] WiltingWisteria: elise still does it pretty quick though, spiderlings tank the debuff
[2:37:09] Rhaegar_UGKz: Isn’t it a counter later? Nothing counter ill early

[2:37:54] Wildpoki: waay to much dmg all need 20% dmg nerf
[2:37:57] junjulyaugust: Illaoi is weak rn cause wider lanes causes tentacles to not hit middle of the lane
[2:38:13] Middiced: Thoughts on Lillia?
[2:38:22] MasterSodaLol: map cover as jungler is kinda pointless
[2:38:28] Lebrowsko: Spoken as a true GIGACHAD
