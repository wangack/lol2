[0:32:57] FirstTimeShaco: I've been going profane hydra into trinity and it feels good
[0:33:06] DesperateShaco: titanic is really broken
[0:33:07] namdnasrm: @Rektyynoob back in 1995 when I was still playing this regularly pink wards had true vision but other wards didn't
[0:33:14] fouljester05: @DesperateShaco Pog
[0:33:29] FirstTimeShaco: is titanic active an auto reset like before ? @DesperateShaco

[0:35:21] FirstTimeShaco: Do you first item or sit tiamat til laner? @DesperateShaco
[0:35:25] FirstTimeShaco: later*
[0:35:34] DesperateShaco: i play janna not shaco
[0:35:37] DesperateShaco: so i havent done much testing
[0:35:40] FirstTimeShaco: Gotcha.
[0:35:43] DesperateShaco: but i think tiamat into bork is good
[0:35:44] salvadorables: is there an ap shaco build
[0:35:48] tokyosinberlin: Ezzz
[0:36:02] DesperateShaco: the hextech item is also nice
[0:36:20] namdnasrm: I would like some aides as well seems useful
[0:36:20] brandinipanini: aids :(
[0:36:25] DesperateShaco: i think bruiser might just be better sadly, but if youre going full lethality then imo profane hydra rush is the best
[0:36:48] namdnasrm: Does shaco do well with a bruiser playstyle
[0:36:53] DesperateShaco: yes he does
[0:37:19] jaizer91: He does aight but then you're not playng an assassin which is lame
[0:37:37] DesperateShaco: you can still assassinate just not 1 tap

[0:50:30] Nightbot: bro
[0:50:39] Giegantors: how bad is the op.gg build
[0:50:51] orphantears23: have we come up with a consensus on ap shaco ??
[0:51:09] dudevaldude: @ChaseShaco what about double lethality item with Grudge as a third?
[0:51:21] Giegantors: volcanic 1st then opportunity is opggs build is it bad
[0:51:33] niarnier: tiamat is like monkey farm from bloons
[0:51:39] niarnier: learn economics bud
[0:51:43] GHOST_TSLU: bork passive slow is so bad tho
[0:51:50] GHOST_TSLU: u alrdy get that off e
[0:51:53] Galkaria: There's always room for a Sky Sunder, crit animations are always underplayed
[0:52:42] niarnier: do u have armor on the dummy?
[0:53:08] gigachadviewer228: We just need E to be adaptive damage
[0:53:40] GHOST_TSLU: dmg is fine im just saying the move speed steal was better
[0:53:46] niarnier: botrk is completely loaded with dmg
[0:53:52] zainith: People asks why build Hydra on Briar since she already has W... Seems like build theory is not the forte for the most part of league players KEKW
[0:53:56] GHOST_TSLU: thoughts on kraken after bork?
[0:54:19] Galkaria: @zainith nobody wants to theorycraft anymore, just ask people "what's the best X right now"
[0:54:37] dudevaldude: @ChaseShaco The test  I did was level 13 shaco, boosted dummy's stats to my own ~70 mr and 70 armor.  boosted Dummy's health to my own ~1700.  Lethality item and botrk is the bet 2 item spike
[0:54:51] emhx: so are we back in assassin ap or no
[0:54:53] zainith: @Galkaria KEKW
[0:54:57] dudevaldude: @ChaseShaco but the 3 item spike of double lethality and grudge is best it seems
[0:55:09] GHOST_TSLU: horizon doesnt work on pets

[0:58:51] niarnier: eclipse also deals 8% MAX not current health damage
