[0:49:35] Nuzzleh: There's the tweet ma boi
[0:49:37] 777raw777: AD LeBlanc has made her return. And while the build doesn’t appear to be strictly stronger than AP LeBlanc for most players, she’s still performing too well on this build. She’s also gotten a bit weaker on her AP builds, so we’d like to return some power there in exchange. Attack Speed Ratio: 0.625 ⇒ 0.4 Attack Speed Growth: 1.5% ⇒ 2.35% Attack Damage Growth: 2.7 ⇒ 2.2 Q Damage: 65/90/115/140/165 (+40% AP) ⇒ 65/90/115/140/165 (+45% AP) E Damage: 50/70/90/110/130 (+35% AP) ⇒ 50/70/90/110/130

[1:08:49] 777raw777: those that make the changes dont play the game
[1:08:59] hoolyganlol: o7
[1:09:10] 777raw777: not to be negative but this season has been one of the worst
[1:09:15] zerotonero: This is not the patch we where looking for.
[1:09:40] Spauldingx: Bob knows the mission spauldSwag
[1:09:42] el_cris_06: road to 100% ratio ap abilities
[1:10:05] Spauldingx: "lol" perfection
[1:10:10] DrDrunkstein99: we ded
[1:10:31] el_cris_06: hahahaha
[1:10:35] Nuzzleh: You should talk to Phreak so that he gives all Leblanc spells 100+ ap ratio
[1:10:52] zerotonero: Hide the pain
[1:10:58] thanzinnn_: @bobqinxd
[1:11:05] curelinzzi: Just keep finding AD builds and shes gonna get overbuffed deserved
[1:11:07] thanzinnn_: we need s14 guide pls lol
[1:11:20] zerotonero: yeah
[1:11:28] Nuzzleh: Keep playing AD Leblanc until they're forced to modernize her kit.
[1:11:46] MillenniumBreakers: just won against a warwick barrier top
[1:11:47] KickinWithDre: can riot hire you to fix leblanc
[1:11:47] MillenniumBreakers: feels good
[1:11:53] curelinzzi: Her and Morgana have the same issue kit aging badly
[1:12:03] felixklich: What are the strongest mid champs atm?
[1:12:35] zerotonero: So many snares, roots, stuns, ...
[1:12:41] Fuzzmonkey: Yeah but there isn't no middle ground then, cause if they made her missile speed 200000 again, they need to introduce more counterplay.
[1:12:48] nubz320: what if riot changed lb w to being a teleport instead of a dash? no cancels and also riot gets static shiv off lb
[1:12:56] Fuzzmonkey: Like, where is the middle ground :/
[1:13:09] thanzinnn_: okey but are the nerfs that strong that shes dead?
[1:13:11] curelinzzi: I hope she gets a VGU
[1:13:15] 777raw777: @nubz320 that would be busted
[1:13:17] Fiddlezahar: Stridebreaker? @bobqinxd
[1:13:43] Nuzzleh: Bobby is forcing Riot to delete Shiv again
[1:14:55] thanzinnn_: ye so just maybe alittle bit more hybrid?
[1:14:59] thanzinnn_: after the patch
[1:15:34] tofivetofive: I love the new Items
[1:15:36] tofivetofive: and the map change
[1:15:40] 777raw777: lucian mid era!!!
[1:15:48] Raydare1: !opgg
[1:15:48] Nightbot: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/NA/sadb0i
[1:15:59] tofivetofive: Also love the fact Mythics are gone!
[1:16:00] NanoSenpai98: Bro you're just getting shiv deleted at this point, so other than trying to make full ap work anything else is literally worthless since it's a matter of time shiv is deleted if you keep playing it
[1:16:11] ireevrug: Are nerfs live? @bobqinxd
[1:16:12] curelinzzi: Id accept even a midscope for her tbh
[1:16:30] jagods0nvnm: go malzahar bro
[1:16:55] Fiddlezahar: Remember how the old Leblanc rework went KEKW
[1:17:03] nubz320: @nanosenpai98 if it’s going to get deleted, might as well play the sh8t out of it
[1:17:48] thanzinnn_: what about statick riftmaker trinity or some shit?
[1:17:51] NanoSenpai98: How would you like to rework her putting in mind that if it's goes slightly wrong it could go for a 100% banrate
[1:17:59] curelinzzi: Her and Morganas kit has just gotten destroyed by newer champs over the years
[1:18:25] Nuzzleh: Don't you lose one AA during trades playing AP now
[1:18:40] VoodooChild420: hybrid might be the play
[1:18:45] VoodooChild420: bobby cookin
[1:19:00] matagordas21: !build
[1:19:01] Nightbot: statikk shiv.
[1:19:06] matagordas21: 😰
[1:19:08] Nuzzleh: Don't let him cook
[1:19:18] matagordas21: What's the Best lb build??
[1:19:22] 777raw777: enough lb bro xd
[1:19:28] Nuzzleh: LMAO fire tweek
[1:19:43] JohnPear3: what if W was a blink instead of a dash would that make a diference? because the dahs can be counter w anything and thats her main source of dmg
[1:20:15] NanoSenpai98: @nubz320 it's pointless since all the ap you win abusing will be eventually lost after it gets deleted, you have to find something stable to climb with
[1:20:22] nubz320: @johnpear3 apparently that would be broken lol, I suggested the same
[1:20:25] NanoSenpai98: Lb*
[1:20:28] JohnPear3: like kassa R
[1:20:41] thepow1er: have you attemped a ap lb only challenge?
[1:20:58] VoodooChild420: like zoe ult
[1:21:12] thanzinnn_: ye its too op but kat has like 4 blinks in tf and kassa has a blink that oneshots you
[1:21:13] JohnPear3: @nubz320 sad i love lb, i loved way back in a days lb combos xD
[1:21:30] TheAleko: So what if it was backwards, blink forward and it dashes backwards? like yone e
[1:21:34] maevs63: !opgg
[1:21:34] Nightbot: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/NA/sadb0i
[1:21:42] supman42: have u played the ap depression build yet?
[1:22:05] thanzinnn_: just make her W a blink but with a delay like kassa R, that would be balanced i guess
[1:22:53] nubz320: @thanzinnn_ I agree would make it more balanced but would probably take away all the sick plays you could do
[1:22:53] bifusuteki: what if they made your w interruptible but the dmg goes through on interrupt
[1:22:55] JohnPear3: @TheAleko that sounds kinda balenced dash on the way back
[1:23:20] thanzinnn_: @nubz320 why? the W now is a dash so it has delay. just make it a blink with a same delay
[1:23:29] TheAleko: @JohnPear3 Who knows, not even riot know what they want
[1:23:40] hoolyganlol: @bobqinxd akali kinda has the same problem, her E2 / R2 which is the main source of dmg are cancelled by A LOT OF SHIT
[1:24:21] nubz320: @thanzinnn_ dash doesn’t have delay, you said it would be a “cast” like 1 second delay. dash is instant just doesn’t land the dmg instant
[1:25:22] thanzinnn_: @nubz320 im talking about a delay betwen using ability and dealing damage, so lika make a blink with 0.5 s delay and it would be the same
[1:26:15] hoolyganlol: well her E2 / R1 / R2 are dashes, so they get interrupted by the same shit LB's W gets interrupted
[1:26:25] nubz320: @thanzinnn_ ooh so kinda like a ability timer is what your suggesting. like after dash you can’t re dash for .5
[1:26:29] Nuzzleh: Akali's problem is being stronger than Leblanc
[1:26:51] Chillz_09: whoever is talking about akali please shut up
[1:27:00] 777raw777: xd
[1:27:00] thanzinnn_: @nubz320 nah, im talkin about makin her W like kassa R. so she dashes after a quick second or less and then she can instant go back
[1:27:06] carloz_44: lol
[1:27:09] Chillz_09: you cant compare a 55% winrate champ to a 47% one
[1:27:11] hoolyganlol: @Nuzzleh yeah she still has Qs for damage
[1:27:23] hoolyganlol: @Chillz_09 make me BigBrother
[1:27:31] psix6psix6psix: !build
[1:27:31] Nightbot: statikk shiv.
[1:27:53] imchastise: will AD still be somewhat enjoyable even after the nerfs?
[1:28:09] JohnPear3: @hoolyganlol the R1/2 feels faster than lb W tho no? less reaction time to counter the dash.
[1:28:14] tngermainee: he kinda clean
[1:28:15] nubz320: @thanzinnn_  okay but how would that synchronize with her r ? delay between dashes or just use it twice with the .5 only in between uses?
[1:28:19] Clingodr: sylas is ultimate mid cuck
[1:28:24] psix6psix6psix: explain full build pls, i dont understand what to build after 3rd item
[1:28:29] RienfIeche: they should change lb passive
[1:28:40] RienfIeche: that clone does nothing zz
[1:28:44] thanzinnn_: @nubz320 the second option
[1:28:55] thanzinnn_: and i think it would be balanced
[1:28:59] thanzinnn_: ap lb could work
[1:29:08] thanzinnn_: if that change would happen
[1:29:24] kitschy_jean: y is riot so hateful toward ad lb
[1:29:26] JohnPear3: @nubz320 i think when he said delay was kinda missleading just think as it was kass R i guess
[1:29:37] TheDanAfter: TheDanAfter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 13 month streak! 
[1:29:39] hoolyganlol: @JohnPear3 R2 yes, I agree
[1:29:40] imchastise: @bobqinxd would the AD build still be enjoyable even after the nerf?
[1:30:14] nubz320: @thanzinnn_  that would probably be a little op because if you timed it right you could probably be casting the next w instantly as returning so that .5 would seem like 3 teleports and only the 1 cast. Which would probably lead to being too op
[1:30:21] carloz_44: 󠀀
[1:30:24] carloz_44: hello
[1:30:38] JohnPear3: @RienfIeche its fun for the jukes
