[0:47:16] Roostmaster: I want Void Staff to be viable on Jhin, so I can finally shut up Eve players
[0:47:21] last_dutch_hero: Also a good AP Jheen buff would be that traps slow more based on AP
[0:47:29] Mirphys: @Dubatt0 pls tell me you were playing jhin not ap

[0:48:17] Ender0Storm: but I like the goofyness off only trap do dam on ap jhin, so don't overdo it either
[0:48:19] Roostmaster: So there's no fucking point to playing Crit ADCs rn
[0:48:37] Roostmaster: Crit feels SO damn bad
[0:48:49] Roostmaster: And has for like, 6 months
[0:48:50] thekillerrtf2: lethality = chad

[0:51:12] last_dutch_hero: Hear me out Taco. Give Jhin Q Hybrid scaling and damage type, Give Jhin R just a bit of AP scalings, and give a slow increase based on amount of AP and you have the Jhizzard
[0:51:15] Fraeph: Saw a clip of doublelift doing a pentakill (heretic) using cyclosword, useful or useless item on jhin?

[0:52:08] spithe: rumble best death animation ever tho XD
[0:52:16] Mirphys: kogmaw didnt make it in meta last 10 years
[0:52:17] tmax221: absolutely busted as fuck but he's got like a 1% pick rate
[0:52:18] InkFlourish: but jhin is sexy murder man he should be meta every season
[0:52:21] w0xell_: @thoggers true tbh

[0:53:42] InkFlourish: kaisa debuffed his mental
[0:53:51] jhinxed1: @jhinxed1 You are right. but 3100 is kinda expensive while you can buy Youmu for 2700. I prefer Youmu first item
[0:53:58] cecchino77: Did u try sunderstrike ? It is in fighter builds seems cool , any thoughts?
[0:53:59] Roostmaster: Also yeah
[0:54:01] w0xell_: hehe so now what is the solution boss
[0:54:04] Pawskal: Kalista can be so broken people  underrate her
[0:54:10] Roostmaster: Crit is just more expensive too
[0:54:11] inTERxTER: kaisas
[0:54:16] bubbletea4567: kaisa
[0:54:18] InkFlourish: kaisa
[0:54:29] qedofus: That's the reason I don't play botlane... Cause you lose mostly cause your partner is incompetent
[0:54:32] labotzirc: Damn taco, i Guess this is the league of legends experience
[0:54:34] Roostmaster: So there's ANOTHER reason that Lethality is better than crit
[0:54:42] bubbletea4567: i always duo botlane
[0:54:47] peshecito: Kaisa is Taco's kryptnite D:
[0:54:51] Geveleu: @jhinxed1 Yea ik its prob better, but i'm new to jhin and taco said crit build is more beginner friendly
[0:54:59] refriedrabies: @cecchino77 It's sadly tied to base ad. I'm sure it's great when you buy it, but it won't scale
[0:55:23] InkFlourish: zilean no q challenge
[0:55:29] Dubatt0: ur zilean has a lasting impression in his brain from dad's belt @IKeepItTaco
[0:55:35] Frolundos: why dont you duo till masters? i mean its so rare u get the chance to duo and its great content
[0:55:36] mccreemo: tips for lucian items atm?
[0:55:55] Roostmaster: Don't play Lucian
[0:56:01] Roostmaster: Jhin Only
[0:56:01] cecchino77: @refriedrabies  oh , i didnt notice but it seemed cool as a healing item which gave me same thing as fleet rune but with lethality
[0:56:23] jhinxed1: @jhinxed1 yea true, can't go wrong either way. I just like youmu first item coz of its active and snowball opportunity way earlier
[0:56:24] Dubatt0: "high standards for duos" >duos with me for videos Clueless
[0:56:48] enzoboy888: Isn't that the same without having a duo? You play with randoms
[0:56:48] Strawb3wy: Bedge
[0:56:53] Dubatt0: @Strawb3wy HALLO
[0:56:54] Roostmaster: I only duo jgs because I despise duoing bot

[0:58:37] jhinxed1: lolz i hate autofilled support
[0:58:47] Roostmaster: The only time you should duo supp is with non-bot rokes
[0:58:52] Roostmaster: Roles*
[0:58:54] bubbletea4567: he is rakan main
[0:58:59] Roostmaster: It's insane

[0:59:26] Strawb3wy: ayy yee send , but imma try to sleep im awake since 4am @dubatt0 im deeedge HahaReindeer
[0:59:50] Roostmaster: I've duoed literally once in the last two months
[0:59:55] jhinxed1: i usually ask my support to play their main, even when they are autofilled.
[1:00:06] AwesomeInABox: i dont even think the data supports nami as good with lucian unless your like challenger/pro
[1:00:07] Roostmaster: And got a 5-43 mid/jg

[1:00:27] DoDGeR_93: same happens when i pick rell and they first time samira
[1:00:31] AugustUwU: surely it is not written above your health bar
[1:00:34] AbsentForAwhile: It's because of the song - the song was amazing
[1:00:36] macriusmen: Why your pushing this wavce ?

[1:00:50] Roostmaster: Push waves after kills to deny farm
[1:01:01] jhinxed1: have you guys notice that towers go down so quickly in the new season?
[1:01:03] Roostmaster: More specifcally, deny XP
[1:01:09] peshecito: what an honest lad ikeepitLOVERBOI
[1:01:15] Dubatt0: it took me 3 button presses to 1shot an adc last game
[1:01:18] Dubatt0: thats 1 too many
[1:01:40] Roostmaster: @augustuwu isnt there like, an average amt of gold that 1 level equals? I think it's around 400, right?
[1:01:45] cecchino77: Did he make a crit build / lethality yet ?

[1:49:31] Cuddle_with_Nami: cassio slow is something else
[1:49:40] spithe: every time you wanna do something . boom thers a nunu in your face :/
[1:50:00] im2ridiculous: was flash last shotting cass not a play there?
[1:50:03] im2ridiculous: she tanked the tower
[1:50:13] andreijajaji: i think u can carry this if u get items
[1:50:20] Dia187: @im2ridiculous was jus gunna say the same
[1:50:40] Wes701: 4 shots ult on cass she probably be dead
[1:50:42] SabinFFVI: its *a* play
[1:50:49] im2ridiculous: ye wasnt sure if it was doable/worth
[1:50:54] Nunii1: I think also you could have flash 4th shot cassio when you saw she was tanking 1 hit from tower
[1:50:55] SabinFFVI: but i think taco was playing to live and then a slip up casued him to flash
[1:51:03] Nunii1: Or just turn and 4th shot
[1:51:09] Ambi_Trigger: good show chap
[1:51:17] stavrostro13: whats up taco its been a while for me
[1:51:20] maskedman2808: i like the confidence
[1:51:31] SabinFFVI: team is so impatient
[1:51:38] magicalpen: man this is nuts
[1:51:46] mastery2seven_: man why do they hate jhin that much
[1:51:51] Wes701: why did their mental broke so quickly?
[1:52:01] Cuddle_with_Nami: oh no
[1:52:04] magicalpen: i can't believe ppl always blame jhin pick... that's why i stopped playing him ugh
[1:52:11] Ambi_Trigger: quitters never win
[1:52:22] deadceppelin: i will clip you saying that and email it to him :)
[1:52:33] dinthefirst: Just mute millio you're tilting to hard
[1:52:41] dinthefirst: Mute his chat no?
[1:52:43] dinthefirst: Lost cause
[1:52:51] mastery2seven_: this same thing happened yesterday with a thresh, what are these players
[1:52:57] SabinFFVI: ironic that the milio is saying you're the problem
[1:53:18] Wes701: or they just surrender
[1:53:21] SabinFFVI: choosing to player enchanter with jhin then complaning when your kit doesnt compliment them
[1:53:25] dinthefirst: Winnable
[1:53:47] Aylona: @SabinFFVI actual truth
[1:53:51] Lichyness: milio expected a lucian pick without using his words
[1:54:01] bubbletea4567: @SabinFFVI tbh taco hovered lucian
[1:54:01] dinthefirst: Your team's positioning is terrible. How are they constantly letting themselves get caught out into NUNU RELL SAMIRA
[1:54:07] Ryuumoku: Wouldnt Serylda be better than collector
[1:54:08] magicalpen: enchanters always complain the most too
[1:54:12] dinthefirst: like what? They cant just play better
[1:54:22] Iosif_Michael: Sadge
[1:54:28] Ambi_Trigger: D:
[1:54:40] zlyomen: s14 jhin players peepoSad
[1:55:01] SabinFFVI: like i played teemo adc today and the only reason we won is coz my team didnt bitch and complain from the get-go
[1:55:07] schemeeee: would it ever be worth to go see serpamts fang if that is still in the game
[1:55:14] spithe: game state might be winnable, but the team mental state sure aint
[1:55:15] dinthefirst: Milios malding when he could've typed in game chat what he was trying to do.
[1:55:19] z3lzz: @magicalpen enchanters have to rely on their carry, if you go mental on enchanter and don't trust your carry, it goes like this
[1:55:21] dinthefirst: Not your fault
[1:55:34] SabinFFVI: peoples attitudes just create self-fullfilling prophesies where things go wrong
[1:55:55] dinthefirst: Taco take a breather after this one, this so tilting even to watch..
[1:55:55] z3lzz: GOTTEM
[1:56:15] Ambi_Trigger: they see blood D:
[1:56:28] Lichyness: i refuse to play ranked for a few days until things settle down and people get used to map
[1:56:31] ClassicTraNe: He got blue arm? An item
[1:56:47] deadceppelin: ignore him and play the game man
[1:56:50] deadceppelin: he won't see reason
[1:56:51] enzoboy888: mute and play the game
[1:56:58] Wes701: people still blaming the pick my god
[1:57:04] magicalpen: crazy thing is you pop off with milos b4
[1:57:05] ezcgamer: lmao
[1:57:16] d4s0n: @Wes701 people always find reason to blame others instead of self improvement sadly
[1:57:19] Lichyness: milio took his e lvl 2 :(
[1:57:25] dinthefirst: "Skill issue"
[1:57:41] KryDBayBay: I think he said it cause it would have picked aomething else instead of milio with jhin
[1:57:43] whinoot: nah jhin pick bad Kappa
[1:57:54] SabinFFVI: dont advocate that stuff
[1:57:56] d4s0n: @Hamstra bruv
[1:58:01] Konno_Saeko: I had to give the follow either way, you were the reason I started playing Jhin in the first place tbh. I just don't play league much anymore. I dont really use twitch much either but eh
[1:58:04] Hamstra: ikeepitLUCY ikeepitLUCY
[1:58:06] KryDBayBay: But i just got here so i migth lost some context
[1:58:06] caffecroissant: what do you think about collector on jhin?
[1:58:12] SabinFFVI: gunn
[1:58:38] Dia187: now that there are no mythics what does ornn upgrade?
[1:58:47] SabinFFVI: certain items have ornn upgrades
[1:58:49] Wes701: soloq experience
[1:58:50] caffecroissant: @Kithenn_ that respond to my question i think
[1:58:52] dinthefirst: Mid and jungle diff
[1:58:55] SabinFFVI: idk if there's a 1 item limit per champ, im guessing so
[1:59:00] spithe: you just telling him to start another ability then meta start probably just put him off so much he coudnt play properly Kappa
[1:59:14] dinthefirst: jungle shouldn't be ganking mid if they aren't performing, and then they blame you
[1:59:15] caffecroissant: @SabinFFVI they should have removed that passive from game when they had chance
[1:59:24] SabinFFVI: nah its a fun passive
[1:59:24] bubbletea4567: how do you loose this one and the previous one ?
[1:59:29] SabinFFVI: i like it ok
[1:59:30] JhonnyJokas: beatiful dogs!
[1:59:33] caffecroissant: what do you think about collector nerf
[1:59:45] jhinzao4: Taco can you explain when it's good to pick fleet and when it's good to pick Dark harvest?
[1:59:48] SabinFFVI: has patch came out?
[1:59:49] dinthefirst: PUPPERS OMG
[1:59:52] caffecroissant: @SabinFFVI yea fun but kinda broken tho late game is huge game changer
[1:59:52] dinthefirst: AAAAA
[1:59:58] XusamoIis: So what is the best build on jhin now?
[2:00:01] z3lzz: WHAT
[2:00:02] caffecroissant: @SabinFFVI leaks by spideraxe
[2:00:02] SabinFFVI: idk about broken, it has impact for sure tho
[2:00:09] SabinFFVI: so no patch tonight?
[2:00:11] whinoot: off role today cool
[2:00:11] Lichyness: ah one of those players who just plays whatever they feel like
[2:00:12] bubbletea4567: shared account ?
[2:00:13] Konno_Saeko: What do you build on Jhin now? Still lethality stuff?
[2:00:21] caffecroissant: @SabinFFVI idk about that honestly
[2:00:29] bubbletea4567: mid jhin lesgo

[2:04:36] Wes701: its kinda like this for preetty much every non meta adc
[2:04:55] OnoDomo626: just getting back into league why are adcs taking ghost and flash over the usual flash heal? also thank you for teaching me jhin over the years
[2:04:56] jhinzao4: Could jhin become meta again?
[2:05:03] Lichyness: i swear some people were building jhin a bit wrong which lead to him doing no damage also
[2:05:13] caffecroissant: @OnoDomo626 kiting is broken

[2:06:32] Ambi_Trigger: LUL
[2:06:45] caffecroissant: i must have a skillissue i always get fisted by jhin with draven lol
[2:07:04] Ambi_Trigger: The mental game is big

[2:09:04] HappyMask91: I'm no great adc player but I've always thought Ghost made more sense than heal in the long term
[2:09:08] caffecroissant: @karldelon vs cc heavy comps pretty much or you dodge everything
[2:09:20] suunatic: @InkyBabaYaga when fed, there's a lot of draven players that get disrespectful and end up throwing their gamed fr fr fr
[2:09:33] Wes701: i think peoples perception of this champ applies to the enemy botlane as well, they end up getting too cocky and dying early
[2:09:39] spithe: ghost definately is more versatile then heal imo
[2:09:50] PhloxStream: @AugustUwU SUSSY
