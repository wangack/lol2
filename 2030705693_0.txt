Do you even have any idea how TRIGGERING it is to hear a grown ass man like who who gets to play video games for a living moan??? Just because he got a kill? Like legit cosplaying as a nutting girl so quit it. It doesn’t matter if your game play is decent your attitude is so FUCKING ANNOYING

[0:50:10] allaure: Unique – Squall: After 2 seconds of having applied Squall, strike the target with lightning, dealing (Melee role 120 − 260 / Ranged role 90 − 195) (based on level) (+ (Melee role 40% / Ranged role 30%) AP) magic damage to them. If the target dies before being struck, they emit an electric field instantly that shocks all enemy champions near them, dealing them the same damage and granting you 30 Gold 30.

She is a friend. But she is not a cat. She’s never depicted on all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature. She does have a pet cat of her own, however, and it’s called Charmmy Kitty.
