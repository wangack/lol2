[1:15:32] Komlin111: do u miss goredrinker already?
[1:15:33] FloatingBrick_: i feel like a big issue with the new mage items is that each champ has a small set of items that are basically required, so its just like before where each champ builds the same items every game even if between different champions more items are being built

[2:59:41] CovenLilith: @towbean AD
[2:59:51] Komlin111: true damage had one catchy line, all of kda was banger
[2:59:54] xShinsen: worth
[2:59:55] ErasmusVitorios: What adjustments u suggest?
[3:00:12] ErasmusVitorios: I had some sucess with him apc but i feel like its lacking some dmg
[3:00:42] 510irv: dude...way

[3:01:09] dinastyxy: Clueless
[3:01:09] Bortle116: graves good
[3:01:09] Jozu_50: true!
[3:01:22] CovenLilith: @ErasmusVitorios Just ability ones.  RN he just doesn't feel good, and he can't carry most games.  Part of that is people need to learn him, but part of that is that he just has issues all over the board.
[3:01:25] dinastyxy: if only he was RIOT
[3:01:26] 아이엠더피치: doublift played him the other day and thought he was ass
[3:01:27] 아이엠더피치: lmao
[3:01:39] dinastyxy: outtraded xdd
[3:01:40] Rose06012: bla
[3:01:42] 22Fate: surely the human playing graves has both arms attached to his bod
[3:01:47] CovenLilith: But just buffing him is the issue Riot always had.  Like look at the Velkoz shit they were pulling when all the Vel mains in high elo said not to just buff his damage lol
[3:02:02] swanmeat00: is ekko W not telegraphed anymore?
[3:02:17] ErasmusVitorios: @ErasmusVitorios i dont think its learning him at this point considering his winrate high elo is still 43% its def some base numbers also i feel like W cd should be lower, and the removed of so many CDR items also dosnt really help
[3:02:28] pyroflexin: Yikes
[3:02:32] CovenLilith: Like I said, adjustments

[3:03:40] ezirai: @pascallaw not a bug ez ult can be buffered
[3:03:44] CovenLilith: I also think you could slightly increase his root duration or how fast it activates, or that it fizzles over moving out of range after activating.  Or making his speed up go a little further.  Scaling missile speeds or cast times.  There's little things that could make him better.
[3:03:52] dinastyxy: the animation looked so bugged
[3:03:54] ezirai: you can ult flash or ult before stun
[3:03:58] august_winds: dang i really wanna know what's going down botlane

[3:06:11] CovenLilith: @darkstargwen They made him shit early like he's supposed to scale, but he scales like shit in comparison to actual scaling champs.  And he can just be deleted all the time tbh

[3:06:49] ErasmusVitorios: @darkstargwen instead of increasing his base numbers like rn they should increase his ap scalings but nerf his bases to make him a proper weak early but good scale
[3:06:53] AntonyTLK1: BIG
[3:06:55] Mcfluffy52: ezreal has 46% winrate @PekinWoof

[3:07:55] the_unstoppable_t_rex: i just came to say hello
[3:07:58] CovenLilith: @darkstargwen Yeah absolutely.  Adjust his abilities further as needed to make him feel better to play.  He doesn't have to be a 1v9 but he can't feel useless when ahead later in the game like it's just not good game design
[3:08:00] Rose06012: good flash tbh

[3:10:37] TowerMonger: I saw that panth ult and thought it was the new adc for a sec
[3:10:42] swanmeat00: pantheon ult makes my loins vibrate

[4:47:04] readerotl: yes
[4:47:07] giul_9: But I just lost an account so
[4:47:24] indigorune: pretty sure you are allowed to use overlays like mobalytics
