[2:21:56] SqueakyClucks: its crazy to think how long its been since you played a stage game vulcan
[2:21:58] shadowymisstep: Considering it's literally how I can tell the days of the week
[2:22:04] jar903: that’s true but i dont care for lec personally
[2:22:25] rulerfromwish: yeah same but i'll watch to see what meta/playstyle look like
[2:22:28] jar903: ill probs just tune in to hatewatch kc 😭

[2:24:08] rulerfromwish: pas vraiment gentil
[2:24:08] Vulcan_LoL: O_o
[2:24:13] shadowymisstep: Because if he plays badly he doesn't have to read the French hate messages
[2:24:18] rulerfromwish: LOL
[2:24:22] jar903: I lived in paris for a year and they get a bad rep
[2:24:32] shadowymisstep: Just because I'm Albertan doesn't mean you can assume I hate the Francophones Vulcan
[2:24:33] shadowymisstep: Jeez
[2:24:42] jar903: but i just dont like kc fans specifically
[2:24:45] Vulcan_LoL: usually a fair assumption
[2:24:49] shadowymisstep: No you're correct
[2:24:51] jar903: i do respect their dedication
[2:25:15] jar903: the french tend to be passionate about the things they care about
[2:25:19] shadowymisstep: I applied to a conference in Montreal tho so better get over my Alberta-ness quick if I get accepted

[2:47:01] rulerfromwish: calculated
[2:47:39] FlyinDachshund: has anyone ever seen Milio cleanse an Urgot r like they showed in his promo video, that made me think of it
[2:48:05] rulerfromwish: nobody play urgot and nobody play milio
[2:48:08] rulerfromwish: so hard question
[2:48:34] FlyinDachshund: yeah I think Milio is fairly common but Urgot definitely isn’t
[2:49:51] rulerfromwish: @callmeflyin is he tho? I like playing with lucian but that's pretty much it
[2:50:02] shadowymisstep: Lucian Milio's pretty meta no
[2:50:03] FlyinDachshund: I’m excited to see some ornns with all his new craftable items
[2:51:06] rulerfromwish: NASH
[2:51:25] rulerfromwish: rell damage to monsters is insane

[2:54:07] shadowymisstep: ntnt
[2:54:42] FlyinDachshund: I do think it’s hard to tell all the stuff Milio cleanses since it’s an AOE cleanse and there are so many abilities flying around
[2:55:47] shadowymisstep: Typical ADC behaviour
