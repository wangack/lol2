[4:04:57] razer_mon: oh IM STONK lemme 1 v 2
[4:04:58] razer_mon: and die
[4:05:10] Marcsvas: gg
[4:06:24] Fry_guy0: that was a pretty exciting match
[4:06:39] Sarnyroth: 447 cs holy
[4:06:45] Fry_guy0: sheeeesh
[4:07:25] Pitju99: hourglass playstyle was more fun imo, this will get old
[4:07:34] Pitju99: but hg too expensive now
[4:08:07] stonedalias: iteams nervd right now?
[4:09:09] Pitju99: don't forget that everyone stacked mr that game and there was a kassadin
[4:09:21] Pitju99: you'd kill the avg champions
[4:09:38] Pitju99: why not
[4:09:43] Pitju99: I think both fine
[4:10:12] Pitju99: why does he have to?
[4:10:27] akteemo: you doing ranked our norms?
[4:10:30] Pitju99: no, go hourglass
[4:10:53] Pitju99: why does he have to go hg
[4:11:19] LtChezo: is tankmo not viable this season?
[4:11:39] Pitju99: does anyone survive assasins now?
[4:11:43] YouAreCuteXD: stormsurge is INSANE
[4:11:46] Pitju99: its just early season issue
[4:12:07] YouAreCuteXD: did they hotfix yet?
[4:12:12] Sarnyroth: Is steraks not good? Some ADCs buy it over Shieldbow
[4:13:20] Pitju99: I get it
[4:13:27] Pitju99: bit rough for sure
[4:13:56] Pitju99: probably just situational build then but assa so broken theyre in every game
[4:14:04] Pitju99: so maybe 1 in 10 games build
[4:14:39] Sarnyroth: @ipav999 is Steraks shield not enough to save you with onhit build? I don't know if its still nerfed for ranged or not.
[4:16:03] Sarnyroth: Sadge Dang
[4:16:19] razer_mon: NAH I'D WIN
[4:16:40] Pitju99: rookern + steelcaps is the most realistic defenses I can think of
[4:16:45] Pitju99: that might stop oneshot
[4:17:11] Pitju99: cause ad does less dmg and u have blind
[4:18:14] LtChezo: tabis
[4:18:59] SzDredd: it is a clown stream so it is a joke ipavClown
[4:19:15] Pitju99: well ap champs are more threatening now
[4:19:26] Pitju99: idk how to survive both i think you just choose one
[4:19:32] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[4:19:52] Pitju99: gargoyle was good cause it worked against both ap and AD but now you have to choose
[4:21:03] Pitju99: I think the logic is teemo has much easier time connecting the dmg
[4:21:04] EG_Kel: Explaining ipavNom
[4:21:11] xxpri1xx: are teemo nerfs for lane or jungle?
[4:21:11] Pitju99: than ornn or garen
[4:21:27] Pitju99: melee champs do more dmg cause theyre melee
[4:21:30] kleentz: Less is more... more pain Kappa
[4:21:48] PootangHunter: Wait, they're nerfing teemo?
[4:22:26] Yatakoi: Hi, is the teemo nerf live?
[4:22:37] PootangHunter: Can someone link me these teemo nerf's please?
[4:22:46] LtChezo: aatrox is clearly a high skill champion
[4:22:58] itsnotspam: Other then singed, who else is in a good spot top? Haven't played in years but thinking about coming back. 🤔
[4:23:11] LtChezo: aatrox
[4:23:18] Yatakoi: @PootangHunter ap ratio on Q 80 -> 70 ult : 55->50
[4:23:29] skreppatada: What runes do I take into tanks? I feel like pta isn't good gamergirlCry
[4:24:02] PootangHunter: @Yatakoi  So q nerf and ult buff?
[4:24:14] Yatakoi: @PootangHunter both nerf
[4:24:21] PootangHunter: Ah thanks :)
[4:25:09] LtChezo: kenny is ranged champ
[4:25:18] Pitju99: yes i think he is lol
[4:25:27] Pitju99: they buffed him
[4:25:41] kleentz: any new movement speed items?
[4:25:50] Pitju99: and kennen has short range
[4:26:26] razer_mon: KEKW MONKED
[4:26:29] razer_mon: no taimo for u
[4:27:13] kleentz: teemo OP ban teemo
[4:27:35] xxpri1xx: the nerfs should have been related to teemo jgl instead of overall teemo
[4:27:37] Yatakoi: i don't thnk you should study the difference by just sticking on melee/range there are lots of different points to think of (tho riot doesn't understand them themselves so they random nerf/up )
[4:27:56] Pitju99: yeah its complicated
[4:28:24] xxpri1xx: malignance
[4:29:35] LtChezo: i dont think you are reliably proc stormsurge in toplane, maybe if you vs a squichy toplaner
[4:29:55] Pitju99: you dont build it early
[4:30:10] magrimar_: nashtooth
[4:30:18] xxpri1xx: is ludens comp not good on teemo?
[4:31:57] Pitju99: gathering storm got even weaker with the ratio nerf
[4:32:10] xxpri1xx: maybe go relentless becuz you gonna have ton of ability haste from malignance
[4:32:40] kepatzup: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[4:32:42] brunoskiski: someone gift me sub for no ads
[4:33:02] Yatakoi: what bulid you gonna do? full shroom?
[4:33:05] KarmicKnight: @brunoskiski good way to kiss a banhammer KEKW
[4:33:36] brunoskiski: @KarmicKnight gift me
[4:34:09] Pitju99: most champs get nerfed at 52%
[4:34:15] KarmicKnight: @Cosmikator hey friend, how has diablo 4 treated you since the last time we played?
[4:34:22] Pitju99: 54% is hotfix tier
[4:34:36] Pitju99: aatrox at 52 is giga broken LOL aatrox is usually at 48
[4:34:43] Pitju99: aatrox is balanced at 47
[4:34:57] LtChezo: yea they gotta buff aatrox coz he isnt strong in high tier Kappa
[4:35:11] xxpri1xx: also buffing trundle
[4:35:18] Pitju99: its how ryze is broken at 45 winrate
[4:35:39] ursowo: Jungle teemo?! I believe
[4:36:03] kleentz: how come rumble managed to dodge nerf
[4:36:08] kepatzup: NotLikeThis
[4:36:33] LtChezo: password is hamburger43
[4:36:42] iboo2300: !rank
[4:37:17] itsnotspam: Ipav please never stop playing!!! We love you. Miss your youtube content also
[4:37:48] Pitju99: Morde is actually really broken
[4:37:56] Pitju99: but I think he's the only one
[4:38:18] Pitju99: he is in lane
[4:38:18] kleentz: lmao
[4:38:26] LtChezo: yea coz that guy played teemo to counter aatrox at worlds
[4:38:27] iboo2300: guess its bc of the map changes
[4:38:32] Remotehead: a bad aatrox vs a bad teemo = teemo wins
[4:38:34] iboo2300: more mushroom space
[4:38:39] ursowo: Old Aatrox maybe, but new aatrox, never in this world
[4:39:10] kleentz: aatrox is weak against singed too?
[4:39:28] Pitju99: even Alan said that teemo played really bad
[4:39:52] Pitju99: probably
[4:40:13] rka007: there was a link for video in that post
[4:40:17] ursowo: The video Link is in the Reddit post
[4:40:27] kepatzup: It was kr vs latam LUL LUL
[4:40:45] Pitju99: ok but skill diff between top laners is gigantic
[4:41:05] Pitju99: one of the best tops world vs lat toplaner
[4:41:36] ursowo: But to be fair, he got camped SO HARD
[4:41:44] rka007: but all other lane hard lose, so they can roam more top
[4:42:09] hentai_yordle: playing Teemo is a league on its own
[4:42:14] KarmicKnight: ignite?
[4:42:32] Pitju99: you got cdr no as
[4:42:44] hentai_yordle: I think you need a diffent approach to the game if you play Teemo comparing to a normal toplaner
[4:44:27] Pitju99: I think hes saying that teemo is special somehow
[4:44:51] ku__re: im special
[4:45:20] grammysgravy123: lol
[4:45:29] itsnotspam: Never miss cannon 💪🏽
[4:48:07] LtChezo: this malphites first item will be stormsurge
[4:48:28] razer_mon: MONKAAA
[4:48:40] KarmicKnight: stormsurge malphite sounds kinda broken
[4:56:53] gooe_c: this season is not fun
[4:56:53] brunoskiski: maplphite typin like graves hasnt been top 5 times
[4:58:04] LtChezo: crazy that jhin is here
[4:58:18] Taqterra: and senna
[4:58:36] Taqterra: whole party
[4:58:46] Pitju99: they gave up on bot its hopeless
[4:58:58] LtChezo: corki clutched it up tho
[4:59:09] ursowo: second time jhin ganks top...
[4:59:16] KarmicKnight: thank god corki had package
[4:59:22] kepatzup: Corki strong on 15 WutFace
[5:00:14] Pitju99: malignance on corki sounds pretty good
[5:01:18] Pitju99: I think ato would kill her
[5:02:08] KarmicKnight: LOL
[5:02:17] Tokesanon: Tokesanon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 57 months! Yo
[5:03:17] ressurected1: shadowflame?
[5:03:43] ressurected1: the crit is nice
[5:04:34] kleentz: inting teemo sounds nice
[5:06:05] BastekNLPT: is dark harvest the best on teemo this season?
[5:06:13] brunoskiski: best shroom build is malignance, lyandries, shadowflame, stormsurge, d cap
[5:06:33] gooe_c: why riot do dis
[5:06:41] Tokesanon: tankmo is dead? i am sad
[5:06:55] Edugator1: @BastekNLPT top 3 definitely
[5:07:15] gooe_c: im really sad
[5:07:57] Pitju99: they buffed heartsteel by 100 hp but prolly still bad
[5:08:15] brunoskiski: i think tankmo can be decent with riftmaker
[5:08:40] Pitju99: they nerfed that item so hard for no reason
[5:08:46] Pitju99: it wasnt even a good item lol
[5:09:04] gooe_c: they want a mage war perma death
[5:09:47] Pitju99: it's just taking unnecessary space in the shop
[5:09:55] LtChezo: i think they were scared and over nerfed a bunch of items but just seemed to ignore all the really strong new ones?
[5:09:56] Pitju99: need space to release more funny oneshot items
[5:10:02] Remotehead: I think you overestimate them, I dont think they have a plan
[5:10:13] kleentz: they removed mallet when no one was using it
[5:10:22] gooe_c: they want ruin lol
[5:10:27] Taqterra: maybe nerf it little by little and when they remove the items ppl will say they were trash anyways
[5:10:28] gooe_c: im sure of that
[5:11:01] KarmicKnight: Ipav, have you considered pivoting which yordle you main? Why not become a Veigar main?
[5:11:35] T0asTee: would you consider rookern vs ap comps smile
[5:11:47] Lazynameross: is vei not crying this season
[5:12:05] TimbalsVivarium: so ap teemo is the move now
[5:12:23] Pitju99: traps was already what low tier was doing
[5:12:26] gooe_c: every champ close kills teemo, is really frustrating
[5:12:28] Pitju99: so now theyre doing well
[5:13:20] KarmicKnight: no more phase rush?
[5:14:28] T0asTee: T1 Untara is a teemo main and he's currently Master 200LP in KR
[5:14:53] T0asTee: Untara is #15 on KR server rn as teemo otp
[5:14:57] Lazynameross: no bloom over void?
[5:15:00] Lazynameross: it has cdr
[5:15:04] KarmicKnight: poppy top?
[5:16:14] TimbalsVivarium: Let's gooo

[5:17:40] T0asTee: he is just partnered streamer with t1 now
[5:17:57] Pitju99: retired i think thats an old name
[5:18:30] SarellaAlleras: MYAAA
[5:18:43] gooe_c: so this is a sroom season.. full ap
[5:19:24] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[5:20:05] gooe_c: im gona miss the builds
[5:20:13] Pitju99: there is no rune that impacts harvest cooldown right? insight or ingenious
[5:20:25] meltedafterbirth: !opgg
[5:20:35] SarellaAlleras: do you think teemo is a top or bottom in bed?
[5:20:47] Lazynameross: i think those are just item cds so shouldnt workon rune
[5:20:55] SpringSong: isnt ingenios only for items it wont work on rune
[5:20:59] Lazynameross: or summs
[5:21:10] Pitju99: i think so too you just never know with riot
[5:21:34] SpringSong: how long dh cd btw?
[5:21:43] CharitableBen: i think its 30 seconds
[5:21:43] Lazynameross: tf this tf mark so dusty
[5:21:47] SpringSong: it always felt to me no dmg with that rune
[5:21:56] KarmicKnight: bard pog
[5:22:02] SarellaAlleras: easy 1v1
[5:22:09] Lazynameross: its for later
[5:22:22] Pitju99: @springsong it does no dmg 1v1 but it can reset in teamfights
[5:22:25] Lazynameross: or now if snowball
[5:22:39] CharitableBen: ok I checked its 45
[5:22:54] SpringSong: @Pitju99 hmm im still gona stick to PR i guess
[5:22:58] KarmicKnight: @SpringSong 45 sec, cd resets on takedown
[5:23:28] Pitju99: I guess if you get like an assist with shroom DH resets?
[5:23:42] Lazynameross: assists work yeah
[5:23:43] SpringSong: yea
[5:23:45] SpringSong: resets
[5:24:04] Pitju99: might make TP slightly better then
[5:24:24] Pitju99: you can TP help the team and set shrooms for more DH
[5:24:44] mklarnecistka: i never understand - is dark harvest stacking and giving more dmg for later?
[5:25:02] Pitju99: yeah each harvest does more
[5:25:10] Lazynameross: OMEGALUL i just realized shadowflame would make dh and cheap shot crit
[5:25:29] OrbitalPeacock: He's scaling POGGERS
[5:25:32] mklarnecistka: @Pitju99 thanks ipavNoted
[5:25:33] Pitju99: wait critting dark harvest? monkaS
[5:25:50] KarmicKnight: we love bard players
[5:25:54] SpringSong: @mklarnecistka it scales with ap/ad +lv base dmg+stack bonus so more stack more dmg and with asist or kill it stacks so you can use it multiple enemies on tf
[5:26:13] Lazynameross: what is hp% for dh to happen? i know flame is 35
[5:26:18] Pitju99: soo shadowflame has insane synergy with DH
[5:26:23] Pitju99: DH is 50%
[5:26:29] Lazynameross: dang
[5:26:41] Pitju99: but if theyre lower before you hit it works
[5:27:25] Lazynameross: no stackie but killie ok
[5:27:36] mklarnecistka: @SpringSong ipavNoted ipavNoted ipavNoted
[5:27:50] Lazynameross: minion nooo

[5:28:56] Pitju99: slowmo
[5:29:01] T0asTee: boots diff
[5:29:04] OrbitalPeacock: ivan didnt get his fanum tax
[5:29:21] SpringSong: I like how all the tanks have more ms than every other champs
[5:29:22] mklarnecistka: u dont have upgraded boots
[5:29:55] kleentz: swift scout btw
[5:29:57] Pitju99: without move quick teemo might be slowest champion in the game
[5:30:01] Lazynameross: is this the mr sunfire item?
[5:30:32] SpringSong: wait is blind works on yellow card?
[5:30:39] LtChezo: sorc

[5:31:43] KarmicKnight: KEKWait
[5:31:44] Lazynameross: too thirsty for stackie
[5:32:00] KarmicKnight: teemo's passive triggered, the global taunt

[5:33:30] Lazynameross: tf not porting anywhere else Smoge
[5:33:37] T0asTee: oneshot tf incoming

[5:35:30] brunoskiski: no shadowflame
[5:35:46] wapezor: Teemo Blinding Dart (Q) bonus AP damage reduced from 80 percent to 70 percent. Noxious Trap (R) bonus AP damage reduced from 55 percent to 50 percent
[5:35:52] wapezor: are these for real? lmao
[5:35:52] SpringSong: luden is bad

[5:36:28] Lazynameross: crypt for more cdr ipavNerd
[5:36:30] CalibanxP: !elo
[5:39:24] T0asTee: horizon focus
[5:39:34] SpringSong: no just go void staff
[5:39:43] T0asTee: void horizon
[5:39:53] mattward777: Cdr?
[5:40:03] Remotehead: You mentioned Cosmic Drive earlier
[5:40:05] SpringSong: ı dont like crypto flower
[5:40:47] RobertoBaggio07: shadowflame?
[5:41:07] Lazynameross: can the buffs spreading to team be seen by enemies?
[5:42:24] Lazynameross: luden
[5:42:28] T0asTee: horizon focus has 20 ability haste
[5:42:28] Lazynameross: too late for tear
[5:42:30] elchapothegreat: hi
[5:42:31] SpringSong: luden bad af,
[5:42:33] ParkingSeal: Arch
[5:42:38] Remotehead: luden doesnt give pen any more, right?
[5:42:40] ParkingSeal: (but not this game maybe)
[5:42:40] andrskrts: arch is too late
[5:42:42] SpringSong: just go cosmic
[5:42:46] Zemmii: nashor?
[5:42:50] ParkingSeal: (for this game, too late maybe0
[5:42:50] elchapothegreat: rocket belt
[5:42:50] T0asTee: horizon focus has 20 ability haste :)
[5:43:01] KarmicKnight: trinity force Kappa
[5:43:20] Zemmii: 15 on nashors tooth
[5:44:12] ParkingSeal: Lichbane has movement ofc. (But removes *continuous* autos from the damage cycle)
[5:44:29] SpringSong: I think you need raba and zhonya or banshee atm
[5:44:48] Lazynameross: rip
[5:44:52] RobertoBaggio07: shadowflame burst damage
[5:44:59] T0asTee: i do think the 10% damage is good for shroom too + reveal is good
[5:45:20] T0asTee: it synergizes with liandry
[5:45:23] Lazynameross: KEKW
[5:45:53] Pitju99: cryptbloom effect looks really pretty but it does nothing Sadge
[5:46:03] KarmicKnight: I like this bard, they aren't afraid to throw their ult
[5:46:14] KarmicKnight: or spend their life KEKW
[5:46:15] SpringSong: this fckn radar stacks 2 is annoys me too much
[5:46:17] T0asTee: @Pitju99 i thought it was every kill but one kill at 50% ap is KEKWait
[5:46:34] Pitju99: yeah it suuucks
[5:46:58] Pitju99: and like 80% of the time it wont heal teammates
[5:47:00] midwesternmarley: League just looks like explosive damage now
[5:47:08] xxpops: buy right away for more shroom dmg
[5:47:22] T0asTee: horizon focus
[5:47:43] SpringSong: imo raba is must for shroom
[5:47:43] RobertoBaggio07: shadowflame?
[5:47:48] T0asTee: the 10% damage increase synergizes with liandry and everything tho
[5:47:56] KarmicKnight: raba isn't worth without voidstaff
[5:48:05] Lazynameross: hes thirsting for cdr rn
[5:48:14] Pitju99: 10% is just not a lot compared to raba or shadowflame
[5:48:32] T0asTee: yes but hes going between cosmic drive and horizon focus
[5:48:40] Pitju99: the pen from SFalone is prolly close to 10%
[5:48:42] T0asTee: KEKL
[5:49:16] Lazynameross: oraora time
[5:50:54] KarmicKnight: lmao xayah
[5:51:07] KarmicKnight: xayah believes they're tryndamere
[5:51:11] Lazynameross: didnt think shed legit try to end there
[5:51:26] T0asTee: KEKL
[5:51:53] Lazynameross: the support teemo way Kappa
[5:51:53] SpringSong: you need raba
[5:52:10] ItsAllDestiny: Shadow flame or dcap no?
[5:52:20] KarmicKnight: imperial mandate seems good, not a lot of AP though
[5:52:34] TerranImba87: Did you lose 3% win rate yet @ipav999
[5:52:35] Pitju99: sflame to crit harvest
[5:52:47] T0asTee: horizon
[5:52:50] mklarnecistka: rabadon
[5:53:01] Lazynameross: oh that was soul rip
[5:53:05] SpringSong: luden trash on all champ never gona ask luden
[5:53:08] Ethniel: horizon or rabadon
[5:53:15] SpringSong: just raba pls
[5:53:23] Yatakoi: horizon works on shrooms now?
[5:53:50] Ethniel: stormsurge and ludens work on shrooms
[5:53:55] KarmicKnight: horizon seems better, but you would make better use of ludens with how you play
[5:54:12] T0asTee: how fast do you need to do the damage for stormsurge
[5:54:12] SpringSong: luden is trash guys ....
[5:54:21] KarmicKnight: within 2.5 seconds toast
[5:54:23] Pitju99: why is cryptbloom so bad
[5:54:26] SpringSong: stormsurge is better
[5:54:35] bigbillk: gotta be dcap with the 40min gathering storm proccing soon
[5:54:39] Pitju99: its such a cool item but its so bad
[5:54:47] bigbillk: :(
[5:54:51] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 item slot ineffeciency - Void staff packs more of a punch
[5:55:10] Pitju99: I know why it's bad but why they made it this bad
[5:55:25] T0asTee: oh dear
[5:55:27] TerranImba87: because it's supposed to be for gold-poor supports
[5:55:55] Pitju99: the heal is nonexistant and rare and impractical
[5:56:06] ParkingSeal: @TerranImba87 Do not worry TerranImba87! ~ Teemo's winrate is still above 3%! #GoodTimes! ipavEasy Still winning. #Riot-BrokenChamps SeemsGood
[5:56:10] T0asTee: KEKL
[5:56:21] Lazynameross: almost
[5:56:50] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 that's not all it does.
[5:56:53] Lazynameross: theres no way bloom is for supp with its scaling
[5:57:03] Lazynameross: idk who they had in mind
[5:57:03] SpringSong: can you just get rid of that horizon and buy raba pls?
[5:57:12] Pitju99: @terranimba87 if I'm poor I wanna spend it on bad items even less
[5:57:13] Lazynameross: 50 base with 50%ap
[5:57:30] Lazynameross: base is trash to point heal amp cant save
[5:57:38] Lazynameross: poor sup wont have ap for %
[5:57:40] mklarnecistka: hourglass
[5:57:46] bigbillk: RABASON
[5:57:47] SpringSong: Luden is fckn trash
[5:57:47] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 compared to void staff you might sturggle to purchase the more expensive items
[5:58:19] KarmicKnight: corpsebloom just sounds useful on like, Kassadin
[5:58:50] Lazynameross: that flash tho
[5:59:06] ParkingSeal: I say go with LudesTempuraPaste
[5:59:13] T0asTee: at this point trade focus or drive for rab KEKL
[5:59:20] mklarnecistka: niceeee
[5:59:37] T0asTee: and go void instead of flower the 10% pen is yuge KEKL
[5:59:40] Pitju99: @terranimba87 you don't build a bad item just cause it's cheaper that only works in theory, you still need the item to be good
[5:59:55] Pitju99: it has low numbers
[6:00:24] T0asTee: didnt get flower heal KEKL
[6:00:27] T0asTee: great item KEKL
[6:00:35] Lazynameross: twitch monkaSHAKE
[6:00:42] SpringSong: its good alternative to void staff cuz %30 mpen+ haste
[6:00:53] T0asTee: QSS'd blind KEKL
[6:00:56] Lazynameross: LOL
[6:00:58] TheSteve: noooo
[6:01:09] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 it's low compared to void staff. Support items have always been cheaper 9i actually agree they're worse, that's why i build tank thresh as support instead of support items).
[6:01:09] RobertoBaggio07: wtffd sjdjsjs looool
[6:01:12] KarmicKnight: bard is goated this game
[6:01:16] Pitju99: 10% mpen is worth like 30-35 haste not 15
[6:01:22] Ethniel: why cryptbloom?
[6:01:32] Lazynameross: for cdr
[6:01:38] Remotehead: Maybe CDR runes?
[6:01:41] TerranImba87: did @ipav999
[6:01:46] Lazynameross: he has runes
[6:01:50] SpringSong: luden is trash man stop saying luden
[6:01:52] TerranImba87: did @ipav999  take Haste Shard?
[6:01:52] Remotehead: ah
[6:01:53] Pitju99: @terranimba87 I know that, but cryptbloom is not just worse, it's less efficient for the gold
[6:01:57] Lazynameross: yes
[6:02:06] Yatakoi: horizon focus bonus damage works on shrooms now?
[6:02:18] Remotehead: it always has I think
[6:02:29] T0asTee: shojin has 25 haste KEKL
[6:02:49] Ethniel: riftmaker instead of crypt would be better. dmg bonus from rift, liandry and spirit visage stack
[6:03:02] Lazynameross: xayah not lifestealing
[6:03:04] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 ah, well gold efficiency varies a fair bit between items - and gold efficiency is a shaky stat to use in assessing the suitability of an item.
[6:03:04] Lazynameross: i scared
[6:03:26] mklarnecistka: lulu shield so big
[6:03:29] T0asTee: why is this game so long
[6:03:41] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:03:45] TheSteve: whew gg
[6:03:51] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 They may buff it for all we know, it's early on and they didn't do a preseason to test it all.
[6:03:51] ParkingSeal: I like how the clown-nose on Clown Teemo's face counts down with the Death-Timer! ipavClown blotLove
[6:03:52] Red_Robiin: gj
[6:03:58] kleentz: ggs
[6:04:07] ParkingSeal: but we won't get to see that again this game... #Sadge TearGlove
[6:04:07] Taqterra: wow I did not expect a dub, noiceee
[6:04:20] T0asTee: no hwei
[6:04:21] Lazynameross: mages NODDERS
[6:04:23] kleentz: they can't close the game.
[6:04:35] SpringSong: if you raba
[6:04:36] Pitju99: @terranimba87 they will buff it is my opinion
[6:04:42] kishaziz: dh is so bad
[6:05:06] T0asTee: no flower NOPERS
[6:05:07] armagic: electrocute would have done like 6-7k in this long game
[6:05:12] T0asTee: void over flower NOPERS
[6:05:13] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 You migh be right dude. I'm just salty we got a double-whammy nerf this patch and are slated for more next patch.
[6:05:25] Pitju99: @armagic not a chance
[6:05:30] Remotehead: So what do you do vs tanks?
[6:05:34] Remotehead: Like mundo etc
[6:06:02] Lejbenz: !book
[6:06:11] ParkingSeal: I mean, Dark Harvest does damage (arguably) at the best possible times ofc (low oponents DESERVE damage ipavREE ipavAYAYA )
[6:06:15] belaruski_ninja_spy: would aery bew better than DH
[6:06:19] sagormistry: y no YouTube videos lately?
[6:06:20] Pitju99: @terranimba87 I understand, I think the nerfs are not that big though, early game is basically unchanged
[6:06:20] TerranImba87: @ipav999 nothing is as satisfying as the cross-map shroom one-shots though.
[6:06:34] T0asTee: inb4 ipav starts going shurelya build to speed up towards shroomed targets KEKL
[6:06:39] SpringSong: @armagic maybe 5k but im for sure not 7k and also total dmg low on DH cuz early game DH is teamfight rune not singletarget burst
[6:06:39] Lazynameross: aery next game Pog
[6:06:39] KarmicKnight: @belaruski_ninja_spy aery has been good on teemo but it snitches where teemo is
[6:06:55] kleentz: comet OpieOP
[6:07:06] belaruski_ninja_spy: @KarmicKnight ya
[6:07:12] T0asTee: its 2200 gold tho
[6:07:23] Lazynameross: you ever run approach velocity
[6:07:31] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:07:32] Pitju99: @ipav999 DH also has lower numbers cause we had low pen this game
[6:07:38] ParkingSeal: can't hide properly with Aeri.. although you *can* taunt them to your current shroom-surrounded position with it...
[6:07:49] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 I'm more salty at the way they nerfed him (going after his late-game scaling) than i am with the amount. I'd rather they nerfed his shroom and Q flat damage and left the scaling alone. I like being a hyper-scaler like kassadin or Vlad.
[6:07:49] KarmicKnight: have you considered building trinity force on teemo?
[6:08:02] Pitju99: yeah others would do less too
[6:08:04] armagic: I think 2nd item morello isnt something to pass on
[6:08:07] Pitju99: just low dmg
[6:08:12] T0asTee: u can get more cdr if u do go ludens tho KEKL'
[6:08:15] armagic: 2.2k for 15 cdr and 90 ap
[6:08:21] T0asTee: prob need to wait til they buff it KEKL
[6:08:22] ParkingSeal: @KarmicKnight luxxLaugh
[6:08:32] TerranImba87: @ipav999 if you're goign to play Aery, you might like Comet as well.
[6:08:34] SpringSong: DH is teamfight rune and it focus on scaling late game it loos bad cuz of earlie part
[6:08:51] SpringSong: Luden bad item dont consider to buy it
[6:08:54] Pitju99: @terranimba87 you might not realise it, but most of the shroom dmg comes from items and base dmg and not from the scaling
[6:09:00] Ethniel: @ipav999 have u tried out the combo of riftmaker and liandrys? currently the bonus damage stacks for each spirit visage items. works on shrooms as well
[6:09:02] Pitju99: the scaling does very little
[6:09:36] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 be that as  it may, it makes me feel* bad :P. I'm susceptible to the psychological impact of nerfs.
[6:09:53] Pitju99: @terranimba87 yeah it's more psychological than anything
[6:10:37] Yatakoi: what if transcendence was a bait ?
[6:10:40] SpringSong: I mean you still looking total dmg what was the dmg at 34 stack did you check it in game?
[6:10:45] Lazynameross: mid not playing singed with that ign? NOPERS
[6:10:52] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 besides, Riot double-dipped us with the stormsurge nerf.
[6:10:56] T0asTee: triple lost chapter build for max mana and cdr KEKL
[6:11:02] KarmicKnight: @Lazynameross they just wanna spin like a monkee
[6:11:15] Lazynameross: Bedge
[6:11:29] EG_Kel: ipavBoomer
[6:11:33] Ethniel: 275
[6:11:33] Smargos: !updtime
[6:11:57] Pitju99: @terranimba87 stormsurge is debatable, I don't think it was that good on teemo but it might reduce the amount of mages that teemo doesnt like facing
[6:12:11] SpringSong: 275 well it looks bad KEKW but you can proc it multiple in TF :p
[6:12:34] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 It was super good vs squishie (which we already do a lot of damage to) and not so good vs bruisers and tanks.
[6:12:42] KarmicKnight: that just shows how bad DH is lmao
[6:12:44] Ethniel: what about tf first strike damage?
[6:12:44] TerranImba87: @ipav999 what was your total damage?
[6:12:45] SpringSong: yea but Electro dealts on 1 person in teamfight
[6:13:09] kleentz: check first strike dmg?
[6:13:15] kleentz: from TF?
[6:13:16] SpringSong: maybe aery or first strike better
[6:13:38] Yatakoi: horizon focus doesn't triggers the reveal passive on shrooms btw
[6:13:42] Lazynameross: not worth without big chance of resets it seems
[6:13:55] T0asTee: first strike for 7% more dmg instead Kappa
[6:14:17] midwesternmarley: Not worth it, but the minigame of farming DH stacks off poppy was fun
[6:14:22] Pitju99: DH is for champs that really suck at proccing electrocute
[6:14:23] TerranImba87: @T0asTee Report for unskilled Kappa
[6:14:24] armagic: I've been running electrocute on teemo for a while now. pretty easy to activate and real god dm
[6:14:34] kleentz: 1st strike for money baby OpieOP OpieOP
[6:14:40] kneeb0y: Electrocute u need to be next to opponent. Dark harvest you are across the map
[6:14:41] Pitju99: like karthus
[6:14:53] Ethniel: how much dmg did twisted fate with first strike?
[6:14:57] SpringSong: Aery or First Strike better it looks like
[6:15:00] KarmicKnight: does fleet footwork not work anymore?
[6:15:09] SpringSong: Arcane isnt good on teemo is it?
[6:15:13] Pitju99: aery is most consistent dmg for full AP
[6:15:35] TerranImba87: @Pitju99 Most consistently uninspiring Kappa
[6:16:04] Pitju99: it has very good dmg considering it's good early game
[6:16:16] T0asTee: does shroom damage contribute to comet cdr
[6:16:24] SpringSong: conqur is useless af most fight is ends insta you cant even stack it
[6:16:48] ParkingSeal: (# blotAery ipavEasy )
[6:17:29] T0asTee: but you have cdr for Q's to permablind adc
[6:17:32] Pitju99: void sorcs is must
[6:17:33] Lazynameross: back to the kitchen ipavNoted
[6:17:33] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:17:38] TerranImba87: @ipav999 what was your total damage?
[6:18:03] SpringSong: with that no dmg you call you did most dmg too
[6:18:15] T0asTee: how about just Stormsurge lichbane shadowflame
[6:18:16] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:18:28] ParkingSeal: I said "don't do it ipav", but I wasn't in CHAT and you didn't hear it apparently.

[6:18:58] kneeb0y: Morellos is pretty good
[6:19:02] Pitju99: at that point might as well
[6:19:05] SpringSong: Raba needed forsure
[6:19:05] T0asTee: goes back to "why not play any other champ"
[6:19:07] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:19:24] Pitju99: storm good cause more pen too

[6:19:41] kleentz: LUL
[6:19:43] T0asTee: then play syndra KEKL
[6:19:47] Lazynameross: because you like teemo Madge
[6:19:47] SpringSong: because I want to play Teemo
[6:19:52] kleentz: Kayle Top lets go
[6:20:00] Pitju99: we are having fun thats why
[6:20:07] SzDredd: @T0asTee It was Why play League 2 hours ago Kappa
[6:20:08] Pitju99: syndra gets LP but no fun
[6:20:10] KeyGee: other champions HUH
[6:20:30] KarmicKnight: Ipav, just main Ornn instead and show us the best item upgrades
[6:21:11] Red_Robiin: skirmish teeto
[6:21:11] armagic: nashor with the omniwamp item?
[6:21:31] SpringSong: the problem is you can runaway from this metas
[6:21:32] Nazvanie_Kanala: U want to play game that teemo isn't made for
[6:21:50] kleentz: omnivamp HP tank riftmaker?
[6:21:55] SpringSong: everyone dealt more dmg than before
[6:22:08] Nazvanie_Kanala: tank isn't teemo made for
[6:22:41] T0asTee: you can go shurelya and mandate to force ur team to go on shroomed enemies
[6:22:46] T0asTee: LETHIMCOOK
[6:23:47] Ethniel: riftmaker?
[6:24:16] Gaarp64: how is alan playing teemo?
[6:24:42] Lazynameross: imagine if client gave actual numbers
[6:25:04] Xiphlo: think its 12% current hp
[6:25:05] kleentz: support taimo
[6:25:31] Pitju99: @gaarp64 he does the same trap build
[6:25:46] TerranImba87: @Gaarp64 he picks him in champion select and then locks in his pick SeemsGood
[6:25:54] ParkingSeal: stops moving for 1.5seconds & disappears passively... blotLove
[6:26:33] SocialMoonCat: no morellonomicon? riftmaker?
[6:26:55] T0asTee: time to go support teemo KEKL
[6:27:00] T0asTee: zaza teemo KEKL
[6:27:18] zazulec: ad teemo maybe ?
[6:27:38] Pitju99: but support teemo gets countered by every single supp in the game
[6:27:50] Pitju99: I played it a lot it feels really bad
[6:27:57] kleentz: critmo OpieOP
[6:28:08] svef_: !opgg
[6:28:38] Pitju99: taimo supp is actually useful out of lane but adc will go 0 5
[6:28:44] xxpops: yes
[6:28:50] xxpops: it's too good atm
[6:29:39] xxpops: well, if your team has cc then yes
[6:29:57] xxpops: so you can drop trap and proc it off the stuns
[6:31:18] EG_Kel: play teemo ipavPog build doesnt counter every other champ in the game ipavNLT test incredibly specific builds for 3 days ipavHmm write down results in text document ipavNotes dont save document ipavWut repeat until retirement ipavBoomer
[6:31:49] Pitju99: jaksho before terminus in this meta
[6:32:16] Pitju99: and rookern if needed
[6:33:05] Lazynameross: varus does this now that radiant is gone right
[6:33:09] Pitju99: I think HG is way too luxurious now
[6:33:17] Asheetomalph: How are you liking Maligma?
[6:33:25] Pitju99: need to stay in combat to stack jaksho as well
[6:33:30] Pitju99: so HG is anti synergy
[6:33:37] Pitju99: same with terminus
[6:33:42] Pitju99: need to keep atoing
[6:33:58] hentai_yordle: this build compared to ap is so bad imo 99% of time
[6:34:10] Ethniel: rooker item

[6:34:44] Pitju99: then you dont splitpush
[6:34:48] Lazynameross: you get the sup item
[6:35:05] kleentz: hullbreaker then just splitpush
[6:35:10] Nazvanie_Kanala: @ipav999 the game do force you to using your R
[6:35:26] Pitju99: you also make their assasins worse at grouping by doing that
[6:35:38] T0asTee: you can worry about them having eve and zed when they have eve and zed
[6:35:39] Pitju99: I dont think its that black and white
[6:35:39] hentai_yordle: but why would you play split teemo if you can split with other champs better
[6:35:40] T0asTee: KEKL
[6:35:43] kleentz: Experimental Hexplate is also a thing. can help escape
[6:36:00] Ethniel: i played as sup teemo vs eve. rookern got me 800 magic shield and tons of ap. eve was no problem anymore
[6:36:07] Ethniel: *hp
[6:36:30] T0asTee: then you ate an annie flash r that wont be used on team
[6:36:32] T0asTee: Kappa
[6:36:34] Lazynameross: really, the sup item that is like how crown used to be
[6:36:46] Pitju99: tabi does help somewhat just can't be too out of position
[6:37:25] Pitju99: assasin is supposed to kill you when youre alone
[6:37:30] Pitju99: thats intended gameplay
[6:37:56] Pitju99: thats a different class
[6:38:00] Pitju99: we playing taimo
[6:38:14] Ethniel: jayce dies and teemo is no bruiser :P
[6:38:16] T0asTee: teemo is classified as an assassin marksman
[6:38:36] T0asTee: so teemo dies to assassins
[6:38:40] T0asTee: makes sense Kappa'
[6:38:54] Pitju99: it can solo every ranged top laner
[6:40:33] T0asTee: teemo top is more like vayne top than kennen or jayce top KEKL

[8:15:03] Vekeki: this build looks li... ResidentSleeper
[8:15:04] Lazynameross: or the40 is already that?
[8:15:21] EG_Kel: @Vekeki wake up catPunchU
[8:15:55] Pitju99: you get more HP and more magic pen
[8:16:08] Pitju99: and the earlier it is in the game the less cdr u lose
[8:16:20] Pitju99: it's at least the same
[8:18:17] Lazynameross: time for axiom arc Kappa
[8:18:24] Vekeki: tbh last time when I had fun with teemo builds wos in like season 7 or 8 xD!
[8:19:26] Pitju99: the more cdr you have the less effective it is

[8:19:48] KeyGee: time for suppot Teemo <3

[8:25:08] SzDredd: singed is Tier 2? wtf
[8:25:10] Pitju99: in NA nobody is master on teemo yet
[8:25:16] Pitju99: rpobably
[8:25:17] frostbite83: not enough sample size
[8:25:19] T0asTee: theres no master teemo
[8:25:23] T0asTee: look at diamond+
[8:25:54] Pitju99: looking at master stats is useless

[8:27:38] SzDredd: Tier 2 vs Tier 5 in NA
[8:27:40] T0asTee: its right
[8:27:47] T0asTee: disagreeing with stats
[8:27:48] T0asTee: KEKL
[8:27:54] Pitju99: its wrong cause like only a few players
[8:27:58] Pitju99: dictate teemo wr
[8:28:03] 514484: have to wait
[8:28:04] Pitju99: not popular enough
[8:28:11] Lazynameross: wouldnt say wrong
[8:28:17] Lazynameross: deceiving maybe
[8:28:23] Pitju99: yeah thats the word

[8:51:45] BrowneMonke: just joined..Thought that was ipav's face for a minute lol
[8:52:38] KeyGee: isnt it good to secure objectives?
[8:54:23] Lazynameross: so much pings
[8:54:35] secwarrior1: what is this vod's opgg ?
[8:55:22] Lazynameross: wardens? why that guy so tanky
[8:55:38] KeyGee: i play gold, usually the enemy ADC clears thr shrrooms by walking over them KEKW
[8:55:39] Quaak3: riot could buff the shroom damage a bit tho
[8:55:43] Sovekz: Yea, hard disagree, that one game where you played a teemo with the haste build, you disrupted them hard with your constant shroom spamming, it seems like you just don't like that playstyle even though it's good
[8:56:03] BrowneMonke: Tankmo is the way SeemsGood
[8:56:13] swarley5455: riftmaker still quite the statstick how do you feel about it
[8:56:42] ikari1212: So you're saying they mistakenly nerfed Teemo with 56% winrate? Or am I misunderstanding?
[8:57:06] ikari1212: Toplane teemo
[8:57:09] xxpops: silver is 56
[8:57:35] ikari1212: Master+ on Lolalytics is 57%
[8:57:39] ikari1212: For global stats
[8:57:54] Quaak3: or play on pro scene
[8:58:22] Stanaris2: LEC starts today :)
[8:58:24] ikari1212: It's because Singed, Gwen, Rumble are equally as broken
[8:58:30] Lazynameross: how we always fight in this same place
[8:58:31] ikari1212: And they snowball more directly
[8:58:33] TheSteve: but is it fun?
[8:58:35] czj0725: damn wtf they nerfed the ratio
[8:58:37] Lazynameross: exact same combo lol
[8:58:38] xxpops: nah it's cus higher tier players have macro and buy sweepers :P
[8:58:41] ikari1212: Teemo still has to place shrooms strategically to win
[8:58:47] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: I have a wild idea. Teemo is broken in lower tiers cause ppl dont know what trinkets are. So what if trinkets were removed from game?
[8:59:06] 514484: lmao they actually nerfed teemo
[8:59:35] ikari1212: The Teemo builds with super high winrates don't build Nashor's though. so maybe nashors is just a wasted item here. Idk. I'm playing Hwei now. I gave up on teemo. I'm just curious :d
[9:00:03] EG_Kel: Explaining ipavNoted
[9:00:12] Quaak3: teemo win games when ppl dont know how to play against him

[9:01:33] 514484: meh honestly aatrox can miss stuff and still win
[9:01:44] Quaak3: but even Aatrox missing everything but one skill shot, can kill teemo, T_T
[9:01:52] Lazynameross: teemo can blind his non skillshot
