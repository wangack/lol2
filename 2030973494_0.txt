[8:45:20] sparkfire007: hi stunt how would you advise learning about wave state as supp? sometimes I see ppl crash a 2nd wave after first blood does that mess anything up?
[8:45:37] sparkfire007: like overstaying a bit for 1 more wave
[8:46:28] Dojimeister: idk, i haven't played much of the new season. but it looks like it's just flipped. how is it different @snj10111
[8:46:38] blahhhhhhhghg: You're a zoning Xerath it's fine
[8:46:52] KlappaKreepo: So maybe we will have lane swaps in competitive back again Kreygasm
