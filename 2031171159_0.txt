[0:05:46] maxastro0: Depends on ur starting weight but usually 2 months is a good time to see a difference
[0:05:49] dophkin: its noob gains
[0:05:53] Wq9ill: takes about 10 years and hella steroids
[0:05:58] hellomishha: 12weeks is cap
[0:05:59] sazns: just take steroids 5head
[0:06:08] KappaEllite: Just use something like tren KEKL
[0:06:12] sazns: The most gym progress will be in your first 6 months
[0:06:24] dophkin: ^

[0:06:34] EricGiby: @dophkin Can i have you on dm for a sec?

[0:06:36] skinnymissfortune: ozempic babe, ozempic
[0:06:41] hellomishha: 2 days - 1 off - healthy food and noticeable in 1-2week
[0:06:41] dophkin: sazns be spitting facts
[0:06:46] maxastro0: The thing is yeah u need 12 weeks to see difference in ur body but ur weight and the weights u can lift will be different way earlier
[0:06:53] sazns: @dophkin ty boss
[0:06:55] KappaEllite: Just stop eating for a week and ull some progress is a week SeemsGood
[0:07:14] hartlessvessl: does anyone know when challenger starts?
[0:07:24] SenorBulls: Depends how much water you're holding in. a lot of the time people have inflammation and lose a good amount of it when they change their diet.
[0:07:27] maxastro0: U can differently see ur weight change in less than 12 weeks if u eat well
[0:07:45] KappaEllite: So just don't
[0:07:51] KappaEllite: Quit eating
[0:07:53] sazns: It depends on your goals, but you can lose like 0.5-2lbs per week of mostly fat
[0:07:59] dophkin: GIGACHAD water enjoyers
[0:08:05] sazns: So if you want to lose 10-20lbs it can be 5-10 weeks if you speedrun it

[0:08:31] Nightbot: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/na/scaryallover and https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/NA/asdifaiospf
[0:08:33] maxastro0: Yeah but the sad fact is it's not very easy ur gonna have to work hard to lose the weight
[0:08:34] skinnymissfortune: Ur diet is more important than going to the gym so if you eat well you’re going to see progress in less than 12 weeks for sure
[0:08:39] scaydwrld: helloo everyone
[0:08:40] SenorBulls: akali players gross me out

[0:11:10] sazns: For losing weight just weigh yourself everyday/eat less and do your 10k steps and thats enough
[0:11:28] WoM_LoL: search up on youtube SeemsGood

[0:12:03] serebi_na: SERAPHINE
[0:12:10] hartlessvessl: the more muscle you ave the higher your metabolism is
[0:12:44] KappaEllite: @andreijajaji I tried this once, 10 pushups for every death. I quit after 2 yone games when I had 12+ deaths WutFace
[0:12:44] sourlime00: you’ll just feel like shit if you have a bad diet. you can still be skinny
[0:12:50] dophkin: long distance runners could eat a horse and not gain weight
[0:12:57] CelestlaI: It's the same concept on what weighs more, a kg of feathers or a kg of iron. 1,000 calories of cupcakes is still 1,000 calories of lean meals

[0:14:15] hartlessvessl: ok nivce
[0:14:33] don_schab: Eat whatever you want, count calories, for muscles try whey and some basic workouts, for just sliming down good thing is just dance
[0:14:41] dophkin: snacking is really bad for weight loss
[0:14:47] sazns: eat protein dense meals cause they be more filling/help preserve muscle
[0:14:54] serebi_na: swimming is op too
[0:15:03] maxastro0: Trin I started going to the gym 2 year ago so I can cosplay some muscular characters, so maybe find some motivation?, like trying to get a bigger dumbtruck  or smth...
[0:15:04] hartlessvessl: that is good. my parents never kept soda in the house

[0:15:11] KappaEllite: Swimming is op but boring as hell
[0:15:13] CelestlaI: You can snack on carrots :3
[0:15:27] don_schab: Snacking is good, just count those calaries, you need snacks for your mental health
[0:15:28] SenorBulls: instead of chippies, buy jerky from costco
[0:15:29] SenorBulls: op
[0:15:29] NoxianTyrant: Swimming hella fun if u add swimming exercises
[0:15:36] sazns: tbh dieting is tough when your family buys tons of banger snacks
[0:15:38] serebi_na: need some waterproof earbuds so u can listen to music or podcasts while u swim
[0:15:40] serebi_na: thatd be goated

[0:17:10] reblochondu38: @NoxianTyrant Apparently, just finding yogurt without sugar in it was a hard task
[0:17:24] maadyyy_: have u listened to new ariana single
[0:17:27] maadyyy_: tell me u did

[0:18:08] hartlessvessl: and a banana bread one
[0:18:11] don_schab: If snackis what make you feel good there is nothing bad about it, just count snack calaries and stick to your limit, there quite few sites that can calculate roughly your calories limit
