[0:04:24] Meyra95: Hello 5upWave
[0:04:43] sharffffff: what i have discovered is that league has too much stuff for me. especially in ranked meta. i don't have brainpower to read how to play champions and which champions counter who and all that stuff. Too many words for me
[0:05:33] FrozenLavaReflector: As a top laner... good...
[0:05:37] divax0x0: Hello
[0:05:56] divax0x0: How are you?
[0:05:57] FrozenLavaReflector: That champion is not fun to play against
[0:06:33] Natsoph04: is league a game that is too old that to get into competitive you need to have been playing it close to the start or can it be picked up within a couple years?
[0:06:34] kendrathompson15: hey hey heyyyy

[0:11:24] JeremyFrieser: How is the lol grind going?
[0:11:46] sharffffff: the thing is, i want to learn league but also feel like it has way too much stuff to learn
[0:12:22] balletbunny: scaling champ means the champ gets stronger later in the match
[0:12:27] kendrathompson15: @sharffffff felt. I barely understand from the amount of hours I've watched it be played

[2:27:38] raimundao03: 5up after this game Deadge
[2:28:22] AkitaAttribute: I've always been surprised people don't go cheapshot on Zoe.  The healing on the rune most people take is so minimal, it's barely worth taking.
[2:29:04] raimundao03: if u one shot like that gm did to u days ago u are good
[2:29:43] AkitaAttribute: Once upon a time I was a zoe main.  750k mastery.
[2:30:09] raimundao03: I swear for a moment I thought he was trolling but then he went 23/6
[2:30:18] TayTayPerseus: no ignite akali worth Kappa
[2:30:27] AkitaAttribute: Zoe been buffed a lot recently.  New items really are gonna make her playable again.
[2:31:12] AkitaAttribute: Many people don't know, but your Q gives you 2 lichbane (passive) procs because of the recast.
[2:31:48] AkitaAttribute: I miss the RNG redemption drops tho.
[2:32:21] Xx_KaiSen: how'd you play hwei into xerath? i just got destroyed in an emerald game

[2:36:09] AkitaAttribute: It's not supposed to be at 6 minutes.  It's supposed to be like every other wave.
[2:36:12] olavi14: And it starts working again
[2:36:23] raimundao03: yeah
[2:36:31] raimundao03: mine is always something else lol

[2:38:15] raimundao03: @AkitaAttribute they nerfed it?
[2:38:17] raimundao03: how
[2:38:31] 9fierce9: What does upgrading Zoe's W do?
[2:39:13] AkitaAttribute: 175 + 15%ap to 125 + 15%ap
[2:39:45] raimundao03: hmmm
[2:39:51] AkitaAttribute: @raimundao03 Just a flat 50 ap reduced damage
[2:40:20] 9fierce9: Dream level unlucky PepeLa
[2:41:52] tim_dice: whats wrong with his minimap? is it a streamer thing
[2:42:04] 9fierce9: he has a cover
[2:42:09] 9fierce9: so he cant get sniped
[2:42:42] raimundao03: your team is cracked
[2:42:42] NemoB90: whats the bubble rng youre talking about? i dont know zoe mechanics :S
[2:42:44] AkitaAttribute: 5up did you ever see the TP bug on Zoe where her W passive would trigger if you tried to TP to an invalid target?
[2:42:55] raimundao03: oh
[2:42:57] raimundao03: maybe not
[2:43:06] cindaly: are you gonna come to nyc this year? weather's still nice now!
[2:43:17] 9fierce9: @NemoB90, Zoe's W drops a spell bubble which she can pick up and use once
[2:43:37] 9fierce9: or her W makes it so spell bubbles can drop
[2:43:41] NemoB90: @9fierce9 but whats the rng aspect?
[2:43:54] NemoB90: ah, gotcha
[2:44:02] 9fierce9: to many numbers for my smooth brain to remember PepeLaugh
[2:44:14] 9fierce9: but its a 10% chance if zoe kills a minion
[2:44:22] 9fierce9: that one I remember KEKW
[2:44:34] AkitaAttribute: W also spawns magic missiles when any summoner spell is used.  Including normal flash, ignite, etc.  Plus gives move speed.
[2:47:04] AkitaAttribute: Not feeling confident this game is winnable.

[2:49:07] walkingtoneworleans: senzBlush
[2:49:48] Treity: @lil__soupy Thats odd, Voyboy was posting as recently as 2 years ago and hasnt posted anything new recently

[5:09:01] neptunesxdl: that fiora build................
[5:09:22] neptunesxdl: bro went grasp, then went triforce (shouldn't have went grasp OR triforce)
[5:09:41] padfootly: @neptunesxdl they're experimenting : 'D
[5:09:59] lil__soupy: hi pad 5upWave

[5:11:36] jeskieKAT: peepoPopcorn
[5:11:38] neptunesxdl: yeah avoid everyone else and don't go grasp or triforce plz :prayge:
[5:11:42] pureiinsanity: You are at THAT elo
[5:11:52] 9fierce9: om
[5:12:02] jeskieKAT: om
[5:12:17] neptunesxdl: just avoid everyone else and make sure not to go grasp or triforce on fiora
[5:13:43] jeskieKAT: catJAM
[5:14:33] pureiinsanity: slowmo
[5:14:57] pureiinsanity: too far it looks like
[5:15:11] FlashxNa: hes not there yet
[5:15:15] neptunesxdl: might be akshan E interaction too
[5:15:17] FlashxNa: its visual bug
[5:15:19] pureiinsanity: barely too far
[5:15:32] FlashxNa: his character isnt where it appears to be hes prob a frame behind
[5:15:36] neptunesxdl: yeah visual bug
[5:15:36] pureiinsanity: Jank hitbox
[5:15:42] jeskieKAT: catJAM take me to the moon
[5:15:48] neptunesxdl: riot tryna make the game 3d moment
[5:16:05] jeskieKAT: SMH glitches
[5:16:08] neptunesxdl: might be a bug too yeah
[5:16:25] neptunesxdl: OH
[5:16:49] neptunesxdl: that's so sad
[5:17:12] jeskieKAT: Tasty
[5:17:13] neptunesxdl: eclipse damage is insane :fire:
[5:17:19] neptunesxdl: oh right wait runes
[5:17:49] lil__soupy: didn't 5up mention duoing with Ant?
[5:17:57] neptunesxdl: u go conq, presence of mind, bloodline and last stand + resolve tree
[5:18:06] neptunesxdl: anything resolve tree works
[5:18:09] lil__soupy: ohhh makes sense
[5:18:12] neptunesxdl: you just choose it for the MU
[5:18:23] unseencharm: what is the current rank?
[5:18:28] neptunesxdl: cut down could work against tanks too
[5:19:27] milkis9098: what type pf pasta did you get?
[5:19:36] neptunesxdl: PTA can work too if it's a ranged match up
[5:19:44] Joker_GGEZ: what
[5:19:55] EmmatheRedPanda: i love that pasta shape
[5:20:04] neptunesxdl: pta is actually way better in lane too so yeah
[5:20:05] lil__soupy: HUH
[5:20:25] 9fierce9: A Gwenethon game after Fiora PauseChamp
[5:20:56] hoshiNstar: Camille?
[5:21:08] neptunesxdl: the main keystone choice is between PTA and conq depending on if it's a ranged match up and if u want to do better in lane
[5:21:24] neptunesxdl: PTA is short trades
[5:21:31] neptunesxdl: so if ur against ranged u can procc PTA easily
[5:21:36] neptunesxdl: and it does way more dmg early
[5:21:44] neptunesxdl: but conq is obviously better if ur scaling
[5:22:05] Anonymous0726: Bell super Strong atm
[5:22:10] pureiinsanity: well they aint sniping you or they ban fiora right?
[5:22:13] neptunesxdl: imo conq does good as long as ur not against like jayce, yasuo, vayne
[5:22:18] hoshiNstar: Is that the same lee
[5:22:22] hoshiNstar: Welp
[5:22:36] Anonymous0726: Something to do with rift herald replacement bugs I think
[5:23:15] neptunesxdl: let nemesis cook on corki fr
[5:23:37] FrozenLavaReflector: According to phreak... triforce manamune is the best pwrforming build
[5:23:50] neptunesxdl: Crit TF is crazy
[5:24:29] FrozenLavaReflector: Top lane gameplay???
[5:24:41] pureiinsanity: i could see Malignance Manamune to be a thing for Corki
[5:25:28] pureiinsanity: yeah like double support item bot
[5:25:44] pureiinsanity: it has to be good
[5:25:51] pureiinsanity: it gives too much value
[5:25:57] neptunesxdl: u don't really go any sustain item on fiora with these runes btw
[5:26:25] neptunesxdl: eclipse, titanic, hull
[5:26:28] neptunesxdl: into jaksho
[5:26:30] SadXBoyX: peak last season?

[5:41:04] Anonymous0726: Mmm plates
[5:41:09] neptunesxdl: no but ur vitals do a  lot of damage
[5:41:14] neptunesxdl: bcuz eclipse is 85 AD
[5:41:17] neptunesxdl: titanic
[5:41:26] neptunesxdl: yeah titanic
[5:43:00] neptunesxdl: yeah if u had Qed into vital u wouldve killed
[5:43:13] Anonymous0726: I saw the vision
[5:43:20] neptunesxdl: yeah situational, and if enemy team is balanced damage u can just go CDR boots
[5:43:58] neptunesxdl: I go W max before E max against teams with a lot of CC so tht the it comes up faster
[5:44:20] neptunesxdl: bro did not understand where the damage came from :fire:
[5:45:03] neptunesxdl: riven is pretty strong but should be useless when u have boneplating and exhaust
[5:45:46] cameron416: gragas what a pal. saving u from xayah root
[5:46:04] briweb11: not5upWiggle
[5:46:15] neptunesxdl: tiamat active should procc ur vital if im not wrong btw
[5:46:40] decepticontechnoorganic: oh good a less awful game
[5:46:49] neptunesxdl: yeah they buffed tiamat active today too because it was kinda slow
[5:47:00] neptunesxdl: u can do it with titanic hydra too
[5:47:02] neptunesxdl: i think
[5:47:04] FrozenLavaReflector: All the hydras have the riamat active now
[5:47:14] Anonymous0726: ^
[5:47:15] neptunesxdl: yeah thought so
[5:47:39] Anonymous0726: That's some range
[5:47:44] neptunesxdl: u didn't have to sell refillable
[5:48:06] neptunesxdl: also u cant AA + E titanic, it bugs out
[5:48:07] Sadwikk: @FrozenLavaReflector yea that threw me off first game with the new items
[5:48:13] neptunesxdl: ur E can't be too fast after ur AA
[5:48:25] neptunesxdl: so the combo is  Q + AA + titanic + E
[5:48:41] neptunesxdl: yeah jhin is insanely strong rn
[5:48:53] neptunesxdl: it's not an auto reset, it just bugs out and deals no damage if u do AA + E
[5:49:16] Anonymous0726: Like Leona q?
[5:49:42] neptunesxdl: hullbreaker
[5:50:26] neptunesxdl: when u have jaksho u can basically tank close to everything
[5:50:44] neptunesxdl: the build after jaksho is just situational so u can go whatever u deem fit
[5:51:02] neptunesxdl: u get more movement speed with the middle component item on hullbreaker

[5:56:46] coolwaveofcalm: I got the Dragonmancer Fiora skin in a box recently and it looks like such a nice skin
[5:57:01] Hayase64: jak'sho 3200g, frozen heart 2300g
[5:57:25] neptunesxdl: dragonmancer fiora isnt THAT good imo
[5:57:30] FrozenLavaReflector: Protobelt was nerfed in the hotfix
[5:57:59] FrozenLavaReflector: its still really good, but losing 50 base damage on the active does matter
[5:58:15] neptunesxdl: Zed is getting hyperbuffed btw
[5:58:20] cameron416: I’m sad enchanters lost their grievous option but also happy bc it means i’m freed from purchasing it

[6:32:36] sansin: dfjgsfasj
[6:32:39] sansin: JFC
[6:32:42] pureiinsanity: they are having a creature competition
[6:32:57] pureiinsanity: Ahri vs Seraphine vs Sona whos most creature beauty show
[6:33:02] zatyna_: are the little feathers part of the new infernal map?
[6:33:58] pureiinsanity: your team has to throw so hard to lose into their trash teamcomp
[6:34:30] hoshiNstar: Wait the ult is back up?
[6:34:53] zatyna_: playing adc is an actual horror game KEKW
[6:35:56] EmmatheRedPanda: I have to get to sleep now, but good luck!!! Have fun :)))
[6:36:19] BluerBlack: Do you need more life steal? Is that still a thing?
[6:36:53] sansin: KEKW
[6:36:57] pureiinsanity: not on MF
[6:37:20] pureiinsanity: if your ult applied lifesteal then maybe
[6:37:33] BluerBlack: In the past it was mostly you have to not get one shoted in the start and there you were really hard to kill
[6:37:39] pureiinsanity: but it doesnt
[6:37:40] sansin: I could never build lifesteal on adc
[6:37:48] sansin: I'm here to kill them

[6:39:38] pureiinsanity: they want kha to kill 5 ppl
[6:39:41] pureiinsanity: its soo awful
[6:39:51] FrozenLavaReflector: theres a reason sylas vs malphite is the biggest counter in the game... three times over
[6:40:23] zatyna_: aspecially when no one else picks a hypercarry
[6:40:34] DragonD2_: it is sylas in jg top and mid has like a 58% wr into malph
[6:40:47] FrozenLavaReflector: 5up... this was confirmed by riot
[6:41:00] pureiinsanity: @5up Did you know they made Lethality flat instead of scaling with level in power this sesason
[6:41:01] DragonD2_: picking malph and leaving sylas in should be bannable
[6:41:16] FrozenLavaReflector: literally top 3 are sylas vs malphite top mid jungle
[6:41:51] pureiinsanity: one of the best ones is like... mord vs rammus
[6:42:48] pureiinsanity: that ones fine tbh
[6:43:51] pureiinsanity: yeah

[8:05:27] 2bnieroperator69z: irony is you only live cause soraka is forced to be clsoe to you cause there is nowhere to go lol
[8:07:23] VengfulDark: Briar needed to ult the baron pit

[8:12:58] auraizen: are you keeping tp?
[8:13:10] sansin: adoraNodders
[8:13:25] pureiinsanity: morelo game for anivia @5up tell ant
[8:13:30] itsCaley: @vengfuldark 100%
[8:14:09] pureiinsanity: as anivia
[8:14:12] pureiinsanity: #reading
[8:14:32] 9fierce9: Hes illiterate pure
[8:14:33] pureiinsanity: yeah
[8:15:05] coolwaveofcalm: smite and tp for shaco? interesting
[8:15:06] pureiinsanity: I KNOW
[8:15:07] VengfulDark: @itsCaley I love champs that have resets on specifically their mobility spell. Trist, Vex ect
[8:15:12] pureiinsanity: he somehow missreads what i say constantly
[8:15:15] pandalisk9: i really like malignance on anivia if you can fit it in
[8:15:17] Hayase64: roa is bad
[8:15:26] pureiinsanity: it is
[8:17:19] 1_shira: he only switched summoners after you picked ziggs I think this is actually intentional
[8:17:19] VengfulDark: Ezreal could have worked as well, but Ziggs is probs the best
[8:17:27] pureiinsanity: yeah the moment it was confirmed weak lane into jinx ziggs was quite the pick
[8:17:33] pureiinsanity: @VengfulDark ezreal weak rn
[8:17:36] BluerBlack: To keep minions from hitting turret?
[8:17:53] pureiinsanity: @BluerBlack and be safe
[8:18:06] VengfulDark: @pureiinsanity yeah, but I more meant in general as a weak side adc
[8:18:33] lil__soupy: so how much is dying too much as miss fortune
[8:18:54] pureiinsanity: @VengfulDark yes normally its good but not right now cuz he's weak
[8:19:00] sansin: NOOOO
[8:19:37] BluerBlack: Weak lane is basically play to keep turret the longest you can right?
[8:19:44] pureiinsanity: @VengfulDark also we saw 2 AD champions on team so AP was completely fine to play this game
[8:20:30] pureiinsanity: this is good ur getting more EXP
[8:20:34] pureiinsanity: copium
[8:20:47] coolwaveofcalm: you're in my worst nightmare scenario as an ADC main
[8:21:39] pureiinsanity: level advantage diff
[8:22:02] pureiinsanity: that solo EXP do be juicy on you tho @5up
[8:23:31] pureiinsanity: no support item do be too troll
[8:24:50] Senz: I LOVE LEAGUE OF LEGUMES

[15:37:40] cameron416: at least it was just regular surprise and not "oMg ur live still pls sleep ur just a smol bean"
[15:37:48] milkis9098: using this to try to fall asleep
[15:40:41] milkis9098: what is the little punch emoji thing that sometimes pops up next to the champ icons above the mini map
[15:40:47] mochakmg: how you don’t get burned out from league   is what is so shocking to me
[15:41:15] mercurial1o1: This nunu pick doing work for the enemy team smoge

[15:42:27] 9fierce9: Nunu is getting bullied so hard
[15:42:59] saaba123: Thats a insane int by akali and a excelent trade for u

[15:43:31] saaba123: It happens
[15:43:46] saaba123: Tho fiora isnt a good matchup against akali i think
[15:43:59] cameron416: milio does not feel good to me rn. shurleyas losing that speed passive hurts bc now it's on staff of flowing water
[15:44:40] saaba123: Yeah i feel that
[15:44:57] AkitaAttribute: So after grinding league for almost 16 hours, how do you feel about the item changes so far?
[15:45:01] 9fierce9: So nunu picked into 3 counters?
[15:45:11] milkis9098: @cameron416 oh weird
[15:46:03] cameron416: @milkis9098 i felt so slow my first game and when i realized i melted. nami however ive been rlly enjoying
[15:46:08] AkitaAttribute: Witts End good item for ADC now?
[15:46:23] TiichaTheGreat: We just have to wait 2 years for the damage to get lower enough again
[15:46:38] saaba123: The storm thingin is a crazy busted item
[15:47:03] saaba123: I was playing vex with it and i one shoted a jax
[15:47:12] AkitaAttribute: Feels like how things were prior to mythic items.
[15:47:18] cameron416: dude the thing is why do stormsurge, shadowflame, and luden's all just give more burst

[15:48:18] 9fierce9: Do you dare?
[15:48:21] saaba123: @animus258 idt tank metas are it either but u still need a balance, having a meta where u cant kill anyone or where u will die without fighting back are not ideal at all
[15:48:36] AkitaAttribute: @animus258 I agree, but we went from tank meta to assassin meta.  Not being able to exist with a Fizz in the game feels bad.
[15:48:42] Animus258: dont click links in league chat
[15:49:08] saaba123: I think 2022 metas in worlds were really well balanced and then they pivoted out of it and now its becoming a mess
[15:50:34] 9fierce9: I think its just demon hours
[15:50:57] b4cc4lord: @saaba123 personally I think 2022 metas were absolute garbo (the adcs were disgusting) but I think 2023 was better balanced, and now its godawful again in a different way
[15:51:58] saaba123: I dont remember 2022 being this bad with ads the only bad thing was galeforce+IE and that was only for a few champs
