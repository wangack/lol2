[1:05:30] YunhoeeAteez: season&
[1:05:52] juvahzil: melee mages r the op move
[1:05:55] cindermagus_: @YunhoeeAteez it definitely feels like we need more mana somehow
[1:06:34] YunhoeeAteez: @cindermagus_ the removal of ability haste hurt mages so bad LMAO
[1:07:12] thanzinnn_: bob maybe just skip storm and go lichbane with rift or smth
[1:07:14] YunhoeeAteez: my full mejai stacks, full build full lux combo did nothing to a jax who only had merc treads...
[1:07:17] YunhoeeAteez: LMAO
[1:07:41] cindermagus_: @YunhoeeAteez honestly im all for the game getting slower cause ability haste was ruining it but it's just for mages XD
[1:07:42] thanzinnn_: thats what i typed XD
[1:08:32] YunhoeeAteez: @thanzinnn_ yeah unless ur a mage building protobelt, ur goona be useless the entire game LMAO
[1:09:00] TakesDab: feeling the dmg over time with Leblanc
[1:09:02] thanzinnn_: @thanzinnn_ what? im talkin about lb
[1:09:20] YunhoeeAteez: @juvahzil ^
[1:09:53] YunhoeeAteez: @cindermagus_ ig LMAO

[1:10:10] i_am_v_: why wouldnt you recommend electrocute?
[1:10:32] thanzinnn_: FUCK STORM
[1:10:34] YunhoeeAteez: @thanzinnn_ bye ur adorable, I meant to reply to a diff comment
[1:10:35] thanzinnn_: GO LICHBANE
[1:10:40] flyhigherlol: stormsurge is bad now
[1:10:54] biggybigal: Noo build the new one
[1:11:05] MagicalTwilight: I rlly dont like storm on lb
[1:11:27] thanzinnn_: i guess storm is only good when goin oneshot with electro
[1:11:33] thanzinnn_: when you go fleet its useless
[1:11:40] thanzinnn_: my opinion
[1:12:33] cindermagus_: idk I went luden's, horizon, deathcap, void and an alternator (was going for stormsurge) for Lux the other day and I did so much dmg but I play first strike... new items feel pretty strong to me
[1:12:37] Fiirap: theres nerf leblanc in next patch?
[1:12:54] aFullMetalMUTT: Have you looked up other LeBlanc players builds yet? just curious since seems so many are doing different stuff
[1:13:23] TakesDab: shadow flame pretty good
[1:13:42] bifusuteki: is it ok for some1 whos snowballing
[1:13:46] acishereee: your team good too that what it feels good with this build
[1:13:56] ChampionshipLeBlanc: that sounds terrible
[1:13:57] orisappa: I feel like if you're behind against that comp you just die and do no dmg. W cd feels long
[1:13:59] YunhoeeAteez: cryptbloom is such a bait at least for me...
[1:14:17] YunhoeeAteez: ornn has that nasty mr item
[1:14:20] thanzinnn_: @YunhoeeAteez same
[1:14:22] YunhoeeAteez: that gives u 400+ magic shield
[1:14:34] YunhoeeAteez: thats whats making me not do any dmg as a mage
[1:14:36] thanzinnn_: @YunhoeeAteez only on like karma mid or idk
[1:14:43] cindermagus_: wtf is Sona doing LUL  shes already the most money hungry enchanter and she doesn't even complete second item
[1:14:46] YunhoeeAteez: @thanzinnn_ yeah or seraphine
[1:14:50] thanzinnn_: @thanzinnn_ yup
[1:14:59] YunhoeeAteez: @cindermagus_ clock it LMAO
[1:15:17] cindermagus_: LUL
[1:15:26] aFullMetalMUTT: ASSEMBLE
[1:15:37] medluxi: nah just go void
[1:16:28] TommySec34: morello 2200 90 ap
[1:16:34] thanzinnn_: 10% is a lot when they stackin mr i guess
[1:16:41] cindermagus_: I think for burst mages/ap assassins void is probably better... cryptobloom would be better for control mages or supportive types but i could be wrong
[1:16:49] volanqarr: i think it doesnt give you healing
[1:17:20] cindermagus_: also is it just or is there no anti shield item now?
[1:17:25] AsianN1nja: you do, you just see it faster and more consistent with ad

[1:19:50] elnat022: is worth liandry?
[1:20:11] thanzinnn_: @cindermagus_ and i dont think they should, lets not compare ad assassins to mages, different playstyle
[1:20:13] volanqarr: @elnat022 not at all
[1:20:35] YunhoeeAteez: @thanzinnn_ wdym

[1:21:29] volanqarr: bro where is your cat?!
[1:21:31] thanzinnn_: that most ad assassins relay on goin in and oneshotting, but mages are more defensive playstyle (orianna syndra viktor etc)
[1:21:43] thanzinnn_: most mages*
[1:21:51] TommySec34: anivia is broken this patch
[1:22:06] dwailet: Maybe ur a main adc and u didnt lnow it

[1:22:10] dwailet: Know*
[1:22:14] YunhoeeAteez: syndra isnt defensive
[1:22:22] YunhoeeAteez: there's control mages, and there's one shot mages

[1:22:32] ilamialie: Akali is the only one from my pool that feels good lmao
[1:22:33] YunhoeeAteez: u cant one shot if u have no shield pen as a mage tho xd
[1:22:39] thanzinnn_: @thanzinnn_ yes but shadowflame could be build on every mage but serpent only on ad assassins. that was not fair
[1:22:58] medluxi: some adc can definitely build serpent
[1:23:00] YunhoeeAteez: @thanzinnn_ girl what-
[1:23:01] elnat022: when play ad lb and when ap ?
[1:23:04] PyramusHD: storm, shadow, into rabadon is what i do
[1:23:07] thanzinnn_: @YunhoeeAteez but mages have easier time to poke the shield
[1:23:16] Szain3: DinoDance
[1:23:18] YunhoeeAteez: @thanzinnn_ not with the removal of ability haste we cant?
[1:23:19] YunhoeeAteez: LMAO
[1:23:21] BobanLoL: Even with storm first, if you miss w its useless
[1:23:53] PyramusHD: @BobanLoL thats just ap lb in general
[1:24:03] Benconroy: just don’t miss Kappa
[1:24:14] thanzinnn_: @thanzinnn_ maybe not on burst mages true
[1:24:40] YunhoeeAteez: @thanzinnn_ i still dont get why u dont think mages should have shield pen xdd
[1:24:46] ssstierghoul: i deleted league cuz of nerf :D

[1:25:16] ilamialie: @ssstierghoul see u next season
[1:25:26] thanzinnn_: serpent is only on assassins, shadowflame could be build on every mage. just make the shield pen on diff item that could be build on less champs
[1:25:29] ssstierghoul: @ilamialie see u next season, brother/sister
[1:25:31] ChampionshipLeBlanc: dont go electrocute
[1:25:35] ssstierghoul: meanwhile will go play dota
[1:25:45] YunhoeeAteez: cuz there's no point in "poking" out the shields, if you cant even damage or get through the shield
[1:25:46] YunhoeeAteez: LMAO
[1:25:57] ChampionshipLeBlanc: aery has the same ap ratio as electrocute @bobqinxd
[1:26:18] Benconroy: just go electrocute at that point LUL
[1:26:37] thanzinnn_: @YunhoeeAteez i guess you can with new ap items, you can go 1000 ap normal game on mages now, shields dont scale with mr or smthj
[1:26:37] ChampionshipLeBlanc: thats what im saying electrocute is trash

[4:32:05] lcharliescreaml: MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1 MercyWing1

[4:32:48] lcharliescreaml: Sry. Organizing emojis
[4:34:54] iFrisklol: Why taste of blood instead of sudden impact?
[4:35:03] leamfor: AD Leblanc was balanced this time outside of top tier play. It was at like 47% wr Emerald+ but 54+ in Challenger
[4:35:03] Nightbot: bob is contractually obligated to run ads by Team Liquid and Twitch or he will get spanked. sorry guys :/

[4:35:39] griffski_: for farm
[4:35:53] mf_ac3: if AP got that same treatment for a couple of patches, would make AP fun for you again

[4:46:31] MrHiLighter: @hstranx no, loading screen. game keeps freezing
[4:46:49] hstranx: @MrHiLighter If the game crashes after champion selection and this error message is displayed, find League of Legends.exe (or the corresponding desktop shortcut), right-click on it, select Properties and make sure that there is no check mark next to "Run program in compatibility mode" in the Compatibility tab. Then restart your computer and try to join a free game to confirm that it works.

[5:11:20] Nuzzleh: Why was AD Lb nerfed bobby? It's not like it was overpowered compared to literally any champ that benefits from AD scaling
[5:11:46] PegboardNerdS2: 10x worse
[5:11:54] evehateclub: @Nuzzleh bc its not her intended build, they dont want her building it
[5:11:56] MrHiLighter: my ranked games look like norms
[5:12:58] Nuzzleh: @evehateclub I get that part but, if it's outperforming her intended build then shouldn't that be fixed instead of the removal of this?
[5:13:22] evehateclub: @Nuzzleh hard to balance ap leblanc bc of pro play
[5:13:46] leamfor: @evehateclub Who gives a fk what they want. If it's what people want to play, why would they want to deny them that?
[5:14:28] evehateclub: @leamfor balance rzns
[5:14:45] Nuzzleh: @evehateclub Oh yeah that's true. Maybe it's time for a successful rework this time
[5:15:10] evehateclub: @Nuzzleh she jsut needs a genuine adjustment/update rather than a rework i think
[5:15:45] virgin0il: bring reworked leblanc back
[5:15:58] leamfor: @evehateclub Then balance the build people want to go, don't fking remove it from the game.
[5:16:13] Nuzzleh: @evehateclub All she needs is love.
[5:16:18] Nuzzleh: <3
[5:16:18] Nightbot: <3 Nuzzleh

[5:20:37] b0ki2308: @bobqinxd why is AD so much better on leblanc? just curious
[5:21:25] ledeljunkrat: huh??? i fell that for ap
[5:21:25] nicoluna95: true and they have much more choice ad champs
[5:21:29] b0ki2308: its easier to be consistent with ad
[5:21:42] NeirHelvetica: i would be afraid if lenlanc got a rework
[5:22:29] beeG3: Sadge
[5:23:06] b0ki2308: isnt it swain mid?
[5:23:17] orzech0707: D: Lego?
[5:23:25] NeirHelvetica: lucian mid is back unfortunately
[5:24:00] b0ki2308: is AD Ahri still viable?
[5:24:16] NeirHelvetica: They tried to bring swain mid but he benefits too well bot lane. way safer
[5:25:16] b0ki2308: theyre buffing triforce champs
[5:25:19] b0ki2308: not triforce
[5:26:11] NeirHelvetica: Cant beat that statik shiv
[5:26:11] b0ki2308: have you tried malignance?
