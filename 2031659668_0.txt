[1:20:44] Snaizzz: i don't think any of those actually that good 1st item
[1:20:49] clueless810: I think the nicest thing about the itemization this season is that the items don’t really feel week, everything seems like it has their own niches and places where they work

[1:22:36] RamboGarnes: @Snaizzz yeah kayn can run in walls but jhin dont get 1 dash

[1:23:07] Epickiwhy: is this THE build?
[1:23:08] Snaizzz: @Snaizzz the problem is not jhin, the problem is there are better champ that can utilize that better
[1:23:10] peshecito: monkaS
[1:23:10] thecutecheerleader: omg what happened to the map
[1:23:28] shadow_boi1: @thecutecheerleader We did a little remodelling

[1:24:11] zGamerCrystal: kalista is actually good in soloq
[1:24:13] shadow_boi1: @veileen_ She got ahead and to not let Jhin win she bought randuins
[1:24:19] Snaizzz: guess that a you problem
[1:24:25] kikkybio: thats rough, no worse feeling than losing to something that isnt in your control
[1:24:28] SansReaper: saw a guy getting chal on mid jhin
[1:24:34] 3in1warrior: bro i hate botlane lmfao
[1:24:38] Snaizzz: can't play jhin when everyone else can build gale force then out duel u last season
[1:24:52] 3in1warrior: gg was fun tho :)
[1:24:55] thecutecheerleader: hows the new season for adc? i was so busy with moving i saw nothing league related for past 2 months
[1:25:07] mervann333: @IKeepItTaco isn't collector beter 2nd item overall?
[1:25:16] Emulutiontv: so fight over farm?
[1:25:24] 3in1warrior: midlane time yea lmao
[1:25:35] 3in1warrior: my kalista was legit 9/1 and i was still tilting cause she wont walk up with me etc
[1:25:40] AESTHETHICC666: you should play mid fr xd
[1:25:43] lethalbonsai: @IKeepItTaco i need some help taco
[1:25:44] 3in1warrior: yea camp the sej lane hehe
[1:25:51] RamboGarnes: lethality jhin is so bad and crit is so bad
[1:26:02] crimsonflames4: Play Empyrean JHIN
[1:26:10] lethalbonsai: like ive been losing all games for past 3 days and i cant win those games alone
[1:26:19] NomadNoah: What's good Taco, hope you're doing well
[1:26:28] shadow_boi1: High noon jhin for the ultimate diff hehe
[1:26:47] NomadNoah: I just crossed the 100 game mark, been feeling very good w Jhin, game's a ton of fun. Thanks for the help
[1:27:01] hero55555f: wait I just joined in, how do you get 0 ganks as bot? the easiest to snowball
[1:27:11] RamboGarnes: I cant win on jhin anymore on this new season
[1:27:16] Snaizzz: so i guess MF Jhin is currently top pick cause lethality huh
[1:27:36] lethalbonsai: like i have a decent dmg and kda, but cant keep up with feed jg and midlaners like i cant stop them from pushing
[1:27:41] athanaael: and what's ur corebuild ?
[1:27:43] Zt4rkAt: sona janna? am i lost here
[1:27:45] midknightcc: @hero55555f No clue some junglers just don't want to win
[1:27:46] Emulutiontv: and when do you build armor penetration then?
[1:28:04] hero55555f: do you feel like there are "bait" lethality items for Jhin so far?
[1:28:04] Snaizzz: yeah they change it back to before Lethality update
[1:28:08] Snaizzz: so it just Pen
[1:28:13] midknightcc: @Emulutiontv When they...build armor
[1:28:23] crimsonflames4: Play Empyrean JHIN man
[1:28:33] malikhulia13: as a wise man once said, just win more 4Head
[1:28:34] quinnyyo: in fights do you have any advice on what to do when reloading your auto's? i tend to panick and spam spells
[1:28:36] Emulutiontv: @midknightcc oh thank you :)
[1:28:47] moofusl: ikeepittaco i prefer that you do not encourage your viewers to play jhin in the mid lane as many of them have been inting my games and the experience is terrible
[1:28:50] lethalbonsai: it feels like riot is punishing me cuz i agresively stomp enemy botlane but later the team helps that bot to get back into the game and at that moment i cant control the game anymore
[1:28:56] Snaizzz: @Emulutiontv u always build armor pen now cause we also have armor pen + lethality item on grudge
[1:29:00] Renascor: NERF JHIN NERF JHIN NERF JHIN NERF JHIN
[1:29:09] midknightcc: @Emulutiontv Lol but nah fr, armor for tanks, lethal to just one shot squishy
[1:29:26] InkyBabaYaga: Sona Janna bot sounds crazy but i believe it be aight.
[1:29:31] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[1:29:34] RyucianArt: @moofusl Then stop shitting on them when they go bot
[1:29:50] moofusl: i play top/
[1:29:55] Emulutiontv: I see..thank you for your answer I was kinda wondering because if lethality and armor penetration do the same thing than why bother building armor pen but it makes sense against tanks if I got you right
[1:30:18] moofusl: i play top that is out my control/
[1:30:33] lethalbonsai: @moofusl you havent watched my jungelers that go 0/10 every game XD
[1:31:03] AbsentForAwhile: Honestly, Jhin mid is risky, at least for now elo
[1:31:10] flux3003: HUHH
[1:31:16] Snaizzz: @Emulutiontv they don't do the same thing, armor pen work on % scaling reduction of armor, penetration just remove the number of armor before damage caculation and raise the base damage higher
[1:31:31] lethalbonsai: damn
[1:31:33] lethalbonsai: jhin vs syndra
[1:31:38] lethalbonsai: its going to be a boring ass lane
[1:32:29] Emulutiontv: @Snaizzz Ok so against squishy targets I can build lethality and against tanks I build armor penetratio
[1:32:33] Emulutiontv: right?
[1:32:33] neeky_1: hey your ring is here!
[1:32:39] NapNapoleon: NO ART
[1:32:49] poseidon_0070: hi I'm a support main what should I pick with jhin engage or enchanter ?
[1:32:53] crimsonflames4: Ghost unnecessary
[1:33:04] lethalbonsai: @poseidon_0070 both are good
[1:33:41] midknightcc: @Emulutiontv Yes but it's still funny seeing some people buying no armor pen against beefy frontline and wonder why their champ feels useless
[1:33:47] lethalbonsai: @crimsonflames4 you aint gonna keep that for your grandma
[1:33:50] lethalbonsai: xd
[1:33:50] Nightbot: XD
[1:34:15] Snaizzz: @Snaizzz on basic lvl yeah, there a thresh hold of how much armor a target have to make u choose but in this season u can stack lethality up to 50 pen which effectively make anyone don't build tabi take true damage
[1:34:35] Emulutiontv: @midknightcc if you dont mind me asking... why would one choose lethality over crit then?
[1:34:35] midknightcc: @midknightcc Losing to shopkeeper essentially
[1:34:49] poseidon_0070: @lethalbonsai soooo its a sona angle ? Hmm
[1:35:02] crimsonflames4: Geez man, Chill
[1:35:12] Snaizzz: Lethality just scale better now while being cheaper
[1:35:29] akurro: your are passive agressive
[1:35:34] akurro: thats what he means
[1:35:38] lethalbonsai: @poseidon_0070 yeah
[1:35:38] Snaizzz: crit items still like 400 gold more expensive while being less consistent cause Crit %
[1:35:45] akurro: LULW
[1:35:52] kynetint: PogChamp
[1:35:54] vsmilotic: he jsut agressive no passive LUL
[1:35:58] AdamusPapa: @Emulutiontv when you build lethality, its still worth to get % armor penetration, champions get armor per level and it's much more effective to get % armor pen later in game
[1:35:58] crimsonflames4: Chill
[1:35:59] AbsentForAwhile: Guys please don't tilt Taco, we don't want him to turn off his mic
[1:36:00] kikkybio: gigachad
[1:36:08] midknightcc: @Emulutiontv Lethal comes online as soon as you buy it, even better now since the change, crit scales so it's most effective once you reach around 60% onward but ofc that will take some time since most items are expensive but worth in the long run
[1:36:11] lethalbonsai: @poseidon_0070 but you have to be agressive when you see jhin adc
[1:36:20] lethalbonsai: like you have to keep up with his mental
[1:36:22] Emulutiontv: @Snaizzz makes sense... thank y'all for answering my questions
[1:36:26] lethalbonsai: yk what i mean
[1:36:28] peshecito: CHANGE OF SUBJECT TIME TO ROACH
[1:36:30] kynetint: yo taco how's day so far? FutureMan

[1:38:01] Snaizzz: @midknightcc yeah also lethality right now also scale well cause at 5 items u have 60 pen and then 30% armor pen on top which basicly true damage for anyone under 200 armor
[1:38:01] Emulutiontv: @obsoleek whats your rank?

[1:38:21] RyucianArt: here's a crazy idea chat: don't backseat the streamer
[1:38:23] MetalFire23x: Remember no one likes a taco that's too salty hhaa
[1:38:28] MetalFire23x: jk
[1:38:29] midknightcc: @Emulutiontv Yes precisely but the counter to that is just tanks scaling for free unless you end the game early
[1:38:31] obsoleek: Was off to a good start but games have been kinda wild lately
[1:38:34] SixtySevenWest: so do you buy Hubris second or third on Jhin? I remember you raving about the buff (first time here if it's already been asked a million times)
[1:38:37] Lichyness: syndra... tough lane
[1:38:37] MetalFire23x: I like my tacos extra salty.
[1:38:47] waftyknackers: i think its simply cool you interract with viewers during game...bad mood or not xd thats entertainment!
[1:38:51] shadow_boi1: I prefer my taco sweet and spicy hehe
[1:38:55] vsmilotic: yes level ghost trade hard when they play double ADC botlane hail of blade
[1:38:58] Unbeheld: yeah keria and guma trade very aggressively using sums
[1:39:02] MetalFire23x: Yeah daddy, spicy taco!
[1:39:02] Emulutiontv: @midknightcc makes sense..again thank you! I learned something today
[1:39:07] Snaizzz: guma does
[1:39:19] midknightcc: @Emulutiontv No prob at all :)
[1:39:19] Tizio__Basico: kindred should be nerfed
[1:39:23] moofusl: yo eastern adcs dont trade lv 1 unless its a bush cheese btw
[1:39:30] Emulutiontv: @obsoleek I see league is kinda wild at times thats why I take it slow I only play 1-2 ranked games otherwise I tilt to hard xD
[1:39:40] obsoleek: smart one tbh
[1:39:42] Tizio__Basico: mid/late kindred is a machine gun
[1:40:04] Emulutiontv: @obsoleek yea I can really recommend that got that approach from coach curtis was his name I think..
[1:40:14] Snaizzz: @obsoleek well if u tilt then often i will say you focus so much on other than looking at what u doing
[1:40:21] obsoleek: yee
[1:40:36] Branfreeze: holy
[1:40:36] Lichyness: GAH
[1:40:37] Soupman456: xdd

[1:41:18] PC_Dave: sadge
[1:41:23] NapNapoleon: I think we know why top is losing?
[1:41:24] Snaizzz: @Snaizzz as much as that an option, that like stun yourself for not at  least try a 5v5 game cause u can't perform as adc without a team
[1:41:32] Emulutiontv: @midknightcc yea I do that too ^^
[1:41:41] Zt4rkAt: 4 sword jhin, nice
[1:41:52] NapNapoleon: Killer bee jhin
[1:42:02] Emulutiontv: @Snaizzz can also be tilting to if someone is afking making it a 4 v 5 :(
[1:42:02] keb_v1: are there any specific adc's that you shouldn't do the lvl 1 ghost trade with?
[1:42:22] PC_Dave: Draven I assume
[1:42:34] Snaizzz: @Emulutiontv well it like what 1 every 10 game, it can't be that frequent
[1:42:34] obsoleek: oh question for yall is red side not just awful all around or is there something im missing
[1:42:43] Emulutiontv: @Snaizzz I agree
[1:42:52] Emulutiontv: still tilting when it happens :P
[1:43:00] Z1sissss: maybe vayne
[1:43:26] Snaizzz: play safe 1v2 bot LUL
[1:43:29] midknightcc: @Snaizzz The best thing is just work with pings, sometimes your team will make a mistake and then everybody is ready to talk instead of going unto the next play
[1:43:34] Snaizzz: that the biggest lie

[1:44:39] Snaizzz: @Snaizzz mine problem is ping is like the worse communication tool we can have between type and voice call
[1:44:47] shadow_boi1: The Natty heal, no unnatural heals
[1:45:09] Snaizzz: u have to look at who pinging and the n actively look between your screen and map to see if they doing what they pinging
[1:45:24] Snaizzz: while maintaining what you doing

[1:57:04] SaltedIIIBlueberries: ghostblade hubris
[1:57:47] Mcsevem77: Clueless just get rooken, you get perma magic shield
[1:57:53] Snaizzz: don't feel like they gonna nerf jhin, he still floating at 51% win rate average
[1:57:54] 1316: what are the stats for other regions?
[1:57:55] REAPERxp: srry, they use what now?

[2:02:27] CoobsLoL: true weak side jhin you just farm as best you can
[2:02:29] eel_mas: it is for riot balancing
[2:02:32] Raiverz: Wrong. They are buffing Hubris.
[2:02:42] Snaizzz: it only 4 days in so we have to see
[2:02:45] SaltedIIIBlueberries: how about aphelios
[2:02:55] Raiverz: TBF jhin is the easiest adc to kite with
[2:03:02] Raiverz: Low skill floor
[2:03:04] RadiantWisp: dude wtf are your ads
[2:03:09] yuor_papa: flavor of the month jhin players
[2:03:12] RadiantWisp: it's all Todd

[2:03:26] CoobsLoL: mf is the lowest skill floor along with sivir
[2:03:27] SaltedIIIBlueberries: yeah that what phreak says about aphelios nerf,
[2:03:28] Snaizzz: most people don't play him optimally
[2:03:43] Snaizzz: and most jhin player playing crit jhin before
[2:03:49] SaltedIIIBlueberries: so pretty they will nerf jhin right?
[2:03:59] CoobsLoL: yeah its like the universal thought jhin is bad but if you play into him it pays back SOOO  MUCH
[2:04:03] lia_markov: Jhin is pretty ok
[2:04:20] ejrat707: Zed is so busted
[2:04:24] Snaizzz: jhin win rate jump by like 3% i think

[2:05:53] R3Dsst: aphelios attack damage scaling will be nerfed by 0.3

[2:21:24] superrenz2: only one takes support item
[2:21:28] clutchw206: AINTNOWAY its recommending trinity force
[2:22:05] yuor_papa: you do earn more gold by swapping cs like that
[2:22:10] yuor_papa: with double support items
[2:22:12] jeaaaaan: fun game :)
[2:23:05] yuor_papa: technically even adcs could abuse this- just selling support item after 1000 gold so you can farm again
[2:23:08] Wewur: If only viktor was a champion
[2:23:33] zafironius: oh i thought you kept it for the support items after
[2:23:38] ThatW0lF: 369 ms nice
[2:23:51] yuor_papa: there is, but you get the reduced gold from cs thing if you keep it
[2:23:56] fantasycrit1: is ghostblade now better or worse for jhin after changes
[2:25:21] zafironius: but does the reduced gold passive stay then? whats the point if you get reduced gold after
[2:25:32] zafironius: seems like too much work in solo q and duo only
[2:25:57] yuor_papa: people are going double enchanter and don't care about the reduced cs gold thing
[2:26:37] DutchieNoTouchie: these void thingies some kind of zzrot variant? i missed a lot

[2:50:51] NapNapoleon: Aight Aight
[2:51:00] develousice: @helneco76 You sort of play a game of tag. You get them low enough that when you know that you can 1v1 and kill, you do it

[2:52:13] yuor_papa: @helneco76 just think- they usually have faster attack speed and you have to reload after 4 hits, so if you're both 100% hp you probably lose that until later

[6:24:30] Snaizzz: not a good league day
[6:24:50] Deathreception2: @IKeepItTaco i play on high ping and im looking to climb out of emerald, you think kalista is a good pick this season?
[6:24:50] Grenjaaa: is galeforce still in game?

[6:25:44] TSONIC: do you know anything about what what he thinks it strongest jhin build rn and why?
[6:25:47] Deathreception2: @Snaizzz the role is a high mechanic role there are very few options
[6:25:52] Grenjaaa: 828
[6:25:57] Astete69: after elder u cant win
[6:26:01] AriesMu_: @TSONIC cause they like the champ maybe
[6:26:01] TSONIC: i see he doesnt build same as doublelift
[6:26:15] Snaizzz: @Snaizzz do not mean u have to play high mechanic stuff, jhin is a low mechanic champ
[6:26:25] Astete69: Doublelift taking your spot as the best JHIN
[6:27:02] Jauneofarc: Tea. Is so bad bard keeps ulting only jhin
[6:27:03] speizcraft: damn nt

[6:27:16] astraism: carryable if your team listened
[6:27:17] Deathreception2: @Snaizzz at the end of the day movement is always something ill struggle with and personally i feel kalista teaches you how to master that better than most adcs
[6:27:18] lilykins234: his dogs are so cute omg
[6:27:20] astraism: un4ch
[6:27:24] TSONIC: oh hi you are back

[6:28:04] Reminteo_: team :nt:

[6:30:13] nickshn: taco just train all of chat to be your swappable duos
[6:30:14] Snaizzz: @Deathreception2 the problem with this is, you think it gonna help but from mine experience it don't, if u can't position as something like Ashe and Jhin which can play at rather safe range with their kit u will not learn from Kalista since it even more punishing and being at more disadvantage don't help
[6:30:52] DairyChronicle: was 63% wr mao to gm last season but im 20% wr on him this season idk what disease i caught
[6:32:21] SNail_B0at: what other supports pair well?

[6:44:05] Nightbot: XD
[6:44:10] azoomi_: Vision
[6:44:10] REAPERxp: got read
[6:44:16] Smol_Grashoper: hmm i think they had vision
[6:44:25] azoomi_: They had it
[6:44:40] azoomi_: Her movement was obvious
[6:44:50] azoomi_: Shea baiting
[6:45:01] tomo_kumo: noo both 1 hp
[6:45:16] tiisco45: polymorph diff
[6:45:29] Smol_Grashoper: i think taco should play more defensive since now its really hard to abuse them, maybe thresh rotate some more to help other lines so then they help taco
[6:45:33] Smol_Grashoper: imo
[6:45:47] kraven_glx: why not fleet? more sutain, safety in lane
[6:45:50] DairyChronicle: @Smol_Grashoper DIESOFCRINGE
[6:45:58] Smol_Grashoper: im just saying
[6:46:06] alecubanno: what build u running taco
[6:46:19] kerberus194: Lulu script
[6:46:23] Snaizzz: u don't  scale as well
[6:46:27] Smol_Grashoper: huh
[6:46:33] tiisco45: i  believe taco should have just recalled and not taken the lantern earlier
[6:46:35] ブンカ: noted
[6:46:37] Snaizzz: u play safe u just become too ueseless
[6:46:45] OwOBunnyBunBun: You never play safe with jhin... Suppots re too wussy most of the time
[6:46:48] Smol_Grashoper: then jhin is a harder adc than i thought
[6:46:51] DairyChronicle: i believe taco should have played better and gotten a pentakill by now
[6:46:52] azoomi_: They would find jim tho
[6:46:56] GrideZeppeli: How we doin'?
[6:47:22] DairyChronicle: tbh this lulu is cracked
[6:47:32] azoomi_: shes good
[6:47:37] Snaizzz: u can play like semi safe to avoid gank on crash but u definitely don't wanna play ping pong wave
[6:47:49] tiisco45: korean lulu PoroSad
[6:48:21] iTzTeaJaey: @IKeepItTaco what's the difference between snowballing and scaling? i never really learned the terms
[6:48:24] azoomi_: idk tresh is kinda rusty this game
[6:48:28] Smol_Grashoper: i didnt want to make taco mad because of what i said, im trying to learn good jhin to be better and well i do not play ranked that much
[6:48:43] DairyChronicle: @Smol_Grashoper it very much comes across as backseating
[6:49:05] Sakyn: Masters today מַמָּשׁ
[6:49:06] Nightbot: BRO ITS MY FIRST TIME, IM PEAKING !!!
[6:49:11] Snaizzz: @CallMeTeejaay snowball u get more gold and experience and put your laner behind and become useless, scaling is just be present for farm
[6:49:18] Smol_Grashoper: and ofc im not trying to imply that "oh you have to play like this" no, i was just saying what i was thinking and that's all
[6:49:19] SNail_B0at: @smol_grashoper you good homie
[6:49:36] azoomi_: @smol_grashoper it's okey dokey
[6:50:04] Smol_Grashoper: in fact i try to learn from taco itself
[6:50:05] DairyChronicle: NAH THIS LULU IS MY GOAT
[6:50:40] tiisco45: keria
[6:50:43] PsychoSulley: What's poppin Taco
[6:50:47] Snaizzz: anyway lulu jinx is really tough for thresh jhin to deal with
[6:50:52] DairyChronicle: oh wait davemon is your mid laner
[6:51:01] azoomi_: XDDD SHE LIVED
[6:51:04] shadow_boi1: @PsychoSulley Bad teams and supports so no mic to focus
[6:51:09] Smol_Grashoper: damm
[6:51:11] azoomi_: SHE
[6:51:12] Smol_Grashoper: unfortunate
[6:51:12] kaiserwroth: snowballing means a proactive playstyle compared to scaling, a reactive playstyle
[6:51:13] azoomi_: LIVED
[6:51:16] Moodyl337: they dont listen
[6:51:16] azoomi_: Twice
[6:51:16] SNail_B0at: guyssss
[6:51:17] speizcraft: damn
[6:51:18] GodsonAlm1ghty: lol
[6:51:20] Snaizzz: have to lane quite a few  insane hook to make it work

[6:51:23] ForestFairyBilly: LUL
[6:51:26] GodsonAlm1ghty: i meab XD
[6:51:40] azoomi_: That's why we play sth else to jhin
[6:51:54] kraven_glx: this thresh is annoying me a bit, he never gives his life for the jhin. he just lanterns and prays jhin can get out
[6:51:59] Sakyn: מַמָּשׁ
[6:52:12] Zandeezee: Damn i didnt realize you were in davemons game until now
[6:52:25] azoomi_: @mysticop20 or he goes for solo poke when he farms and gets no life
[6:52:25] Snaizzz: @MysticOP20 it is the correct play, u can't survive jinx with passive either way
[6:54:05] DairyChronicle: this is the best lulu player ive ever seen by a mile i love them
[6:54:06] IKeepItTaco: thresh is fine
[6:54:08] SNail_B0at: this is awesome season 14 looks fun
[6:54:09] IKeepItTaco: lulu is baiting everyone
[6:54:14] IKeepItTaco: jinx triple kill was cause davemon didnt kill lulu
