[1:08:01] blp2306: is corki good now?
[1:08:09] scarletflo: @sp_grimmlin Corki passive is that he deals a portion of his dmg as magic dmg so magic pen = strong

[5:56:06] LogantheBrogan: Gwen good with items this season
[5:56:14] BeefBiggly: @loganthebrogan BloodTrail
[5:56:19] Dreww_P: 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
[5:56:23] cmon_john: @louierpn but we miss out on goat corki lines :(
[5:56:25] CravenCalico: She still lives
[5:56:26] Amaresu_: @LogantheBrogan except you specifically picked her to kill tanks and she cant kill tanks anymore
[5:56:28] llincc: @sepherick1 she was played a lot in LEC today
[5:56:28] FuwafuwaYui: entire enemy team is faker
[5:56:35] Kytromal: she shant die
[5:56:36] PRAIRIEDOG2021: your package is so huge bro
[5:56:36] Serpiii: lol still 0 deaths on poppy
[5:56:36] the_tozo: 0 hp tbh
[5:56:38] Requiemlol: pobUnlucky
[5:56:39] Amaresu_: lec is pre gwen nerfs
[5:56:40] PRAIRIEDOG2021: jajajaja
[5:56:47] LogantheBrogan: @Amaresu_ ok yeah but item synergy is pog if you get out of lane alright
[5:56:53] sepherick1: @llincc really? i'll look for the vod, ty.
[5:56:57] Amaresu_: @LogantheBrogan that is the history of the gwen
[5:57:03] llincc: they didnt nerf gwen they nerfed riftmaker
[5:57:06] Amaresu_: yeah ig
[5:57:08] PRAIRIEDOG2021: pretty sure
[5:57:12] Amaresu_: oh well whatever
[5:57:14] Amaresu_: same shit
[5:57:31] nobanarino: ? no they nerfed gwen
[5:57:31] neythn: why is there a timer on the tower
[5:57:34] gwendollgaming: theyre nerfing her next patch but it relatively small
[5:57:38] DizzierDizzi: ryze turned his scripts off
[5:57:38] gwendollgaming: iirc
[5:57:41] gwendollgaming: or wait
[5:57:45] gwendollgaming: no its the hotfix
[5:57:47] LogantheBrogan: gwen gaming would know
[5:57:49] Kytromal: not a single cinder
[5:57:52] gwendollgaming: its just passive damage
[5:57:56] dorawinifred: Cutting down on Gwen’s auto attack scaling to account for the new item system. Passive Damage: 1% (+0.8% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health ⇒ 1% (+0.65% per 100 AP) of the target's maximum health
[5:58:05] dorawinifred: they nerfed her
[5:58:06] gwendollgaming: yeah its just bc she can get more ap now
[5:58:10] LogantheBrogan: we’re pob200 tonight
[5:58:13] zachimon: makes sense
[5:58:14] Amaresu_: imagine they re making her even worse vs tanks OMEGALUL
[5:58:16] PRAIRIEDOG2021: bro if corki is in the meta for lck we will see at minimum 3 games where chovy goes for 400 cs
[5:58:17] gwendollgaming: they did the same to teemo kayle
[5:58:19] LogantheBrogan: tfw maidenless
[5:58:19] Amaresu_: just nerf her burst lmao
[5:58:21] MarfusMcGarfus: No Cinders? Nerdeg
[5:58:23] Amaresu_: clueless company moment
[5:58:33] Kytromal: each scinder is like 16 gold
[5:59:18] memesdestroyedmylife: didnt grab ryze cinder BabyRage
[5:59:28] Brother_KKona: -1
[5:59:29] LogantheBrogan: who is bami & why does he have a cinder
[5:59:29] x_TDeck_x: where do the cinders come from?
[5:59:30] Amaresu_: 700g PauseChamp
[5:59:35] LogantheBrogan: the real question
[5:59:38] JohnHambo: racist cannon
[5:59:44] gwendollgaming: @Amaresu_ this is just false LOL she still dominates tanks, all her best matchups rn are vs tanks/juggernauts
[5:59:44] the_tozo: is he maxing e or q in lane
[5:59:47] zPostModern: hope they change infernal map, the cinders are such a flop
[5:59:57] runningshoes: out here collecting cinders, like you're bard cosplaying
[6:00:08] meowjification: the slow item
[6:00:08] nobanarino: isnt it 90% on the sword
[6:00:10] SiIentShadows: senna Q slows
[6:00:12] Amaresu_: @gwendollgaming i saw pro players play her into rookern ksante and sion and she needed 3 mins hitting them to kill them
[6:00:13] defnotmiracle: Her Q slows too
[6:00:25] meowjification: her Q procs on hit, the item she has slows like the old lethality item
[6:00:34] DizzierDizzi: did this season revive league?
[6:00:39] llincc: i had a ksante jungle in placements today pobPooratticus
[6:00:48] gwendollgaming: @Amaresu_ ok well her wr into sion is 60% so
[6:00:48] louierpn: does lethality even work with corki
[6:00:49] LogantheBrogan: pobPooratticus
[6:00:51] runningshoes: @llincc go on...
[6:01:02] llincc: @runningshoes we lost in 20 minutes
[6:01:03] meowjification: @louierpn eclipse no longer gives lethality
[6:01:03] Amaresu_: @louierpn eclipse doesnt have lethality
[6:01:04] LogantheBrogan: I’m waiting to do placements
[6:01:07] Kytromal: their mayo...

[6:01:19] TheTraderKing: I got a feeling WooooHoooo BlackEyedPea
[6:01:21] LogantheBrogan: we must hold the mayo
[6:01:21] zachimon: ecliipse not having lethality feels so weird
[6:01:30] rmsprowler: why did serafine go to hawaii a lot? because she loved "sarafine" (surfing).

[6:01:48] LogantheBrogan: @rmsprowler he’s back!!!
[6:01:48] brother_______: League player.. mad..? Susge idk
[6:01:52] LogantheBrogan: love this guy
[6:01:53] gwendollgaming: it doesnt rly matter if shes a bit slower killing tanks bc they cant out damage her healing
[6:01:59] Kytromal: fire everything
[6:02:02] iHicccup: @rmsprowler you’re done bud
[6:02:03] the_tozo: senna r actually hurts wtf

[8:28:10] Winzlo123: wait what is this game
[8:28:21] drasik13: @gleachmoney personally I’m brand new to the game but basic common sense tells u that if someone is upfront and tells you it’s gonna be a rough game for them and you choose to play it it’s on you it’s not on the person that got screwed by the matchmaking to give up x lp and take a timer on their q
[8:28:29] drasik13: just so u don’t lose points
[8:28:33] wiima_dicfit: @winzlo123 it’s new arena on one

[8:31:37] drasik13: @gleachmoney no at the end of the day 99% of the player base makes $0 playing the game so they care too much about a game they make no money playing but it’s how it goes but if someone gives u a warning and u choose to play with that liability that’s on no one but you
