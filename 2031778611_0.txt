Are you...quite sure you desire 17 individual CocoaDrop_ s, each with their own JENN engraving? While we are certainly capable of providing the volume necessary, the cost of JennPat s alone would be ruinous. Please respond with confirmation so we may being production.

[6:02:15] luxanna_2k: I can say that people who are pierced down there especially if both parties are pierced... As well as depending on the type of piercing, people have gotten stuck together.   Also for those wanting to stick random foreign bottles or objects in the nether regions especially the backdoor. Please remember: If It doesn't have a base it will disappear without a trace.  Ask yourself if you really want to call the fire department or show up in the emergency room if it gets stuck?
