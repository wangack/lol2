[0:46:44] SnakeFart23: i tested some runes and it seemed aery did most dmg
[0:48:10] FlippedTurtlex: in small trades with 3aa pta good, but overall not the best choice
[0:48:22] SnakeFart23: yea ap teemo
[0:48:42] SnakeFart23: but i think aery does more dmg with shrooms through out the entire game
[0:48:52] SnakeFart23: pta maybe in laning
[0:48:58] SnakeFart23: not sure
[0:49:35] cayaboun: all star?

[1:35:17] BeanBoyAhoy: malignence grows mana pool too
[1:35:24] suppaahh: @Spegge forgot about that

[2:27:35] 514484: nashor no hp, hexplate hp EZ
[2:27:44] 514484: glad you're liking this playstyle
[2:28:09] PhilosoPhiddle: The uptime on Experimental Hexplate active is a lot. Literally procing it on CD almost every time
[2:28:09] kablooom: sounds good
[2:28:29] jordyutopia: @514484 first time i tried it and saw i was oneshoting people with shrooms i fell in love with the playstyle
[2:28:35] Leetmmoman: great build i like the ultimate haste
[2:28:43] 514484: this has ad, it won't oneshot people
[2:28:45] Leetmmoman: it feels good having 8-10 second shroom
[2:28:47] 514484: but LOTS of control
[2:28:49] 514484: and it's safe
[2:28:53] Ê¥æÊïôÊéàÂçöÂ£´ÂÖàÁîü: DinoDance
[2:29:13] jordyutopia: @514484 without hex ofc
[2:29:34] jordyutopia: hex is full utility
[2:29:41] jordyutopia: super safe
[2:29:48] PhilosoPhiddle: @ipav999 It last 8 secs too. So you are basically buff'd for near 1/3 the game.
[2:29:57] Oitetment: Shutdowns probably
[2:30:03] kablooom: every game is diff tho
[2:30:30] 514484: it's a very safe build, it gives easy waveclear and ltos of control
[2:30:43] 514484: hopefully he will play it more
[2:30:58] kablooom: but it sounds really solid
[2:31:01] jordyutopia: lot of value coming from hex
[2:31:02] kablooom: hexplate
[2:31:28] kleentz: you are surviving zed assaults. seems good
[2:31:42] 514484: teemo becomes a splitpusher with this bild
[2:31:45] 514484: because safety
[2:32:02] 514484: FeelsGoodMan
[2:32:36] jordyutopia: @514484 exactly, you got it, that is why riftmaker and nashor were good last season  because you had the 1v2 potential, but now they can't even catch u
[2:32:52] 514484: last season i would play liek this
[2:32:59] 514484: but liandry into cosmic
[2:33:13] BeanBoyAhoy: wow Zed lost
[2:33:29] 514484: sadly the game has other issues, i would play it more
[2:33:51] 514484: was liandry his second item?
[2:34:10] 514484: wow ok
[2:34:11] jordyutopia: mali 2
[2:34:17] kleentz: wonder what your usual movement speed that game.
[2:34:49] 514484: FeelsAmazingMan
[2:35:02] 514484: so glad you finally like this build
[2:35:15] night_pink: i get friend reqests only when i play bad. is it just me?

[2:47:38] lokken_tak: when the fire nation attacked
[2:47:41] xxpops: hex plate w/ swift boots and phase rush seems like decent plan
[2:48:01] xxpops: w/ teemos repeatable r
[2:48:21] xxpops: probably something there
[2:48:47] PorcupineFeel: aatrox is the matchup I was waiting for
[2:50:14] Kabrewie: Who would win - a demon send to destroy the world, or a rat with PTSD?
[2:52:29] xavisonline: can anyone tell me when exactly he built swifties? like the order?
[2:52:59] Kabrewie: Vs champs with slows pretty much, you rush it. So vs sion, aatrox, mordekaiser

[3:05:35] PhilosoPhiddle: Just get HeartSteel now for the LoLZ !! :)
[3:07:00] T__Ballin: How is teemo feeling?
[3:07:06] T__Ballin: with the new items
[3:08:48] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: How's the tests going ? Last time i came you were saying that this was one of the worst season for the taimo
[3:09:24] T__Ballin: So no challenger this season
[3:09:26] T__Ballin: or maybe
[3:10:07] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: Im in EUW and even in high silver/low gold they perma deward shrooms and you cant play based on them
[3:10:28] PhilosoPhiddle: The only think I can say for certain for all champs at this point, is that Mythic removal was a great idea. It is so nice not to be forced to build myth in first 3 items for best gold use.
[3:11:42] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: What do you think about a bruiser ad build like: botrk>triforce>kraken ?
[3:14:45] DCraven_0ne: maaan... first they remove night harvester, now they nerf Stormsurge... Riot keeps runing everything i like xD
[3:16:01] DeadlyBoy1234: Hi Ipav, i realised smurfing very close to main helps learn new roles or test build. otherwise the game knowledge byitself makes builds viable.
[3:16:48] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: what do you think about building shieldbow again ?
[3:18:33] Leetmmoman: 14
[3:20:02] ursowo: @Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku Shibo
[3:20:16] majin0thinus: Why does stream say content restricted?
[3:20:29] majin0thinus: I can't hear or see stream lol
[3:23:27] DCraven_0ne: @majin0thinus Ivan has no pants on and the system thinks you're too young to handle that.
[3:23:47] DCraven_0ne: ipavHmm
[3:24:26] majin0thinus: well idk the reason but it seems to be an issue that others have too

[4:13:35] FirstTimeShaco: S14 is so much more fun than s13 even with all the broken shit
[4:14:40] tmptmtm2: mythic is fuckin board
[4:15:00] saintcoca: because now you can spend your gold like a human
[4:15:41] forg1vens04: what do you think about the teemo nerfs next patch ?
[4:15:44] Sarnyroth: Is it Naafiri jng?
[4:15:57] Lazynameross: ye
[4:16:00] ursowo: Seems so
[4:16:02] Sarnyroth: Oh it is, no wonder they lose.
[4:16:10] Sarnyroth: That champion is already terrie.
[4:16:14] Sarnyroth: Terrible*
[4:16:33] Sarnyroth: And then you play it in a sub optimal role.
[4:17:11] ursowo: It's not even the champion, it's the lack of skill that's hurtful to watch
[4:17:37] tmptmtm2: trinket R is OP
[4:20:30] tmptmtm2: so fast
[4:20:44] Sarnyroth: Spooky
[4:20:59] Sarnyroth: Dang ADC looks weak
[4:21:05] Sarnyroth: Bard got 3 shot
[4:21:08] EIWich0: that healing
[4:21:18] Sarnyroth: Better nerf Teemo
[4:23:38] FirstTimeShaco: 3/14? :|
[4:23:40] Autisymous: that ashe is tankier than her frontline
[4:23:45] EIWich0: league of jg
[4:23:54] suppaahh: after looking at this match I can see R provides no dmg because of heals and shields
[4:24:05] Sarnyroth: @eiwich0 *and bot
[4:24:10] tmptmtm2: does jg teemo have hope?
[4:24:36] EIWich0: @Sarnyroth true
[4:24:51] LayZeeAce: so how bad were the teemo nerfs guys, be honest with me
[4:25:17] Sarnyroth: Teemo shrooms could literally do true dmg and you'd still lose bc of jng/bot diff being too big
[4:27:05] saintcoca: or only place shrooms for fights
[4:27:11] 0bzerver: stormsurge
[4:27:12] kexboi: horizon focus maybe?
[4:27:27] Sarnyroth: Horizon only procs on really long range hits
[4:27:39] kexboi: 700 range is not that long, to be honest
[4:27:45] JET_FL: cosmic move speed is nice
[4:27:45] kleentz: storm OpieOP
[4:27:48] Sarnyroth: @ipav999 can't buy Ludens with Malignance i think
[4:27:52] EIWich0: i think storm or luden
[4:27:57] tmptmtm2: horizon trigges shrooms?
[4:28:02] qcluuu: my friends and i played against your teemo 2 games ago and my top laner is still telling me to ban teemo
[4:28:23] Autisymous: dunno if you can get two lost chapter items
[4:28:34] Lazynameross: you can
[4:28:37] Sarnyroth: I think Ludens Malignancy and Seraphs are exclusive
[4:28:57] BottleRocketBoy: Horizon used to not work on traps
[4:29:03] BottleRocketBoy: Not sure if that's still true
[4:29:06] Lazynameross: you cant buy more than one of %mpen item
[4:29:11] EIWich0: i dont know bro, taimo sucks so bad lmao
[4:29:19] Aldurfus: it works on traps to my knowledge
[4:29:21] Lazynameross: or tear item
[4:29:31] ModnarErom: horizon is decent
[4:29:46] Autisymous: wiki says horizon doesnt trigger of traps
[4:30:03] EIWich0: yes
[4:30:04] Autisymous: pets and traps dont trigger horizon
[4:30:14] EIWich0: luden
[4:30:57] funhero2: would shiv be troll?
[4:31:03] funhero2: its wave clear and does ap
[4:31:11] kleentz: collector Kappa
[4:31:20] Aldurfus: oh yeah, looks like they changed HF to remove the procing on slows
[4:31:26] suppaahh: I honestly dont think its possible to make traps do dmg, maybe traps are only good vs teams with no shields and heals
[4:31:52] funhero2: but with how often people get sweeper and stuff, are you expecting shrooms to be your main source of dmg in fights?
[4:31:53] KarmicKnight: Hello Ipav, how goes the item science
[4:31:55] EIWich0: traps are goo just in low elo.
[4:32:41] softygold: te amo ipav
[4:33:18] Varelico: Is this unranked?

[4:34:41] EIWich0: oh no
[4:34:43] Sarnyroth: Viego top i think
[4:34:58] KarmicKnight: cassi top makes sense
[4:35:07] EstebanElGuapo: why they remove the shadowflame's dmg bonus vs shields
[4:35:21] Autisymous: someone googling "teemo counter" and picking cassio would be a classic
[4:35:34] Lazynameross: sf was bs marketed as antishield
[4:35:44] KarmicKnight: cassi took forever to pick, they prob don't know how to play against teemo I bet
[4:35:46] Lazynameross: serpents better in that regard always
[4:36:27] EstebanElGuapo: would be nice for an ap to have an anti shield though
[4:36:38] Lazynameross: it would Smoge

[6:01:25] Laivratz: hey ipav, is there a new item you woudl call "core" for teemo?

[6:09:41] Aldurfus: peepoPooPoo
[6:11:36] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: It's funny how riot nerfed an item that never worked well and a champ that doesn't work in high elo
[6:11:46] Ê¥æÊïôÊéàÂçöÂ£´ÂÖàÁîü: FallHalp
[6:13:00] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: I'm talking about riftmaker and teemo obviously
[6:13:34] Cosmikator: happy sunday morning everyone! ipavKit
[6:13:51] Lazynameross: ipavHappy
[6:14:05] FemboyTarkov: @ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO i dont think riot really anticipated teemo every building it. rift was def supposed to be an ap tank/bruiser item for the mordekaiser-types
[6:15:19] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: Yeah no I don't say riftmaker is for teemo, I'm saying that they nerf things that don't need a nerf
[6:15:26] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: Or even need a buff
[6:15:47] FemboyTarkov: @ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO yeah riftmaker was pretty balanced where it was, i think if they knocked down the omnivamp by like 2% and kept  the true damage itd be guud
[6:16:00] Aldurfus: @Cosmikator hello catKISS
[6:16:35] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: 6% omnivamp after 5sec combat I don't know
[6:16:51] xavisonline: anyone know if riftmaker might be good for a bruisery galio build
[6:17:16] Cosmikator: riot wants to show off all the newer champs in Championships thats why all old champs getting nerfed to hell. thats how u attract more ppl to play league and spend money.
[6:17:26] SzDredd: @Cosmikator Happy Mechabellum Sunday you mean Kappa
[6:17:42] Cosmikator: catKISS @Aldurfus @SzDredd
[6:17:51] SzDredd: @cosmikator :3
