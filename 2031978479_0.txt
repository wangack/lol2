[1:55:48] Solomonike: why does this feel so wholesome wtf OMEGALUL
[1:56:36] TYLER1__PLAY______VARIETY: @Solomonike Hey, ill answer your question for you. It probably feels wholesome because you're seeing two new teamates build chemistry while communicating to share creep score gold, ultimately entailing a bonding expierence to you developing a sense of joy

[2:28:43] vincentive_: the name is testing for limit testing
[2:28:47] vincentive_: KEKW
[2:29:04] pikachauchu: now can't even walk up lmao
[2:29:23] TYLER1__PLAY______VARIETY: Any tips on how to play into a heavy poke lane like this one as a short range ADC?
[2:29:44] pikachauchu: @TYLER1__PLAY______VARIETY not do what tristana did
[2:30:07] pikachauchu: You basically play passive really and farm under tower unless there's a real good opening
[2:30:53] TYLER1__PLAY______VARIETY: @pikachauchu dont u just get poked out, cant cs etc
[2:31:59] RekaAdc: i think first jungle has tp be aware of the matchup and try to come when they push too hard
[2:32:12] pikachauchu: Also really depends on support Milio offers the sustain but not much else for her. If it was Ali/Leo you could just all in lvl 3 and potentail burst them
[2:32:34] RekaAdc: then yeah if u just play safe u get poked out until ur too low and get dive so u have to do something or else or losing too much
[2:32:40] vincentive_: cait lux is such a cancer lane to go against lol
[2:33:53] pikachauchu: i think really against poke lanes you just go D shield instead or fleet just to not get super shit on in lane
[2:33:56] vincentive_: good thing we got cookies
[2:34:00] pikachauchu: if you're really worried about it
[2:34:05] Noreason_4: is zac really good
[2:34:09] Noreason_4: blaber was playing it earlier
[2:34:11] Noreason_4: and now umti
[2:34:18] vincentive_: umti played it last game, too
[2:34:49] RekaAdc: @pikachauchu yeah true if u plan on not doing anything and just want to farm and scale
[2:35:14] saaandinosaur: LMAO
[2:35:40] vincentive_: I think the best you can really hope for is that you are able to hit a power spike and be able to all in
[2:35:53] vincentive_: But this lane is too far gone already
[2:35:56] Noreason_4: average caitlyn lux lane
[2:36:01] twebs11: nah this gotta be cyber bullying
[2:36:07] shadowymisstep: @pikachauchu Blaziken acquired hurray thank you
[2:36:11] pikachauchu: @vincentive_ the lane was gone when trist rocket jumped lvl 1 onto them
[2:36:12] Noreason_4: i think i dodge every game i see caitlyn and lux
[2:36:14] Noreason_4: if i can
[2:36:18] Noreason_4: i just hate this lane
[2:36:29] RekaAdc: tris milio is very weak in lane i dont know why they picked that
[2:36:29] pikachauchu: @shadowymisstep lmao glad I could help ^.^
[2:36:51] shadowymisstep: ACTUALLY since I'm here does anyone have Scarlet. I need the exclusives
[2:37:04] yellowazns123: tristana actually played so well in alne
[2:37:37] RekaAdc: @yellowazns123 why do u think that
[2:37:58] pikachauchu: I want to know as well
[2:38:27] Noreason_4: milio looking balanced
[2:38:35] pikachauchu: If anything trist is just getting salvaged by her team right now.
[2:38:36] vincentive_: outside of cs, the trist didn't really die for one
[2:39:27] Noreason_4: damn fakegod renekton
[2:40:06] vincentive_: comeback mechanics are great, guys
[2:40:25] pikachauchu: ^.^ yay comeback gold
[2:40:36] shadowymisstep: League is so well-designed
[2:41:11] vincentive_: isn't umti a kr player?
[2:41:13] pikachauchu: yeah look at that durability patch we had a while ago. It means nothing anymore :)
[2:41:17] pikachauchu: @vincentive_ Yes
[2:41:26] vincentive_: oh he came from brion dope
[2:41:28] shadowymisstep: @vincentive_ UmTi was on Fredit Brion but signed to TL for 2024
[2:41:28] coal15: is he in call with berserker?
[2:41:35] shadowymisstep: @coal15 Nope, Berserker's resting his voice
[2:41:53] shadowymisstep: Sorry not Fredit Brion, OK SAVINGS BANK Brion
[2:42:02] vincentive_: If there's any team I can trust in building a korean roster, it's TL
[2:42:07] Noreason_4: @shadowymisstep OK BRO
[2:42:09] vincentive_: Or C9 KEKW
[2:42:12] pikachauchu: OK BRO Umti will be missed
[2:42:21] pikachauchu: our General Umti
[2:42:21] shadowymisstep: I did like UmTi on BRO
[2:42:23] shadowymisstep: o7
[2:42:24] Noreason_4: @vincentive_ c9s korean team sucked tho
[2:42:29] Noreason_4: actually both did tbh
[2:42:40] shadowymisstep: C9 is better at integrating Korean players onto an NA roster imo
[2:42:50] vincentive_: I was memeing about c9
[2:43:01] BallsyEagle: oh just realized noct is bugi, lots of LCS players in this match
[2:43:02] Noreason_4: @shadowymisstep if its not summit or winsome then yeah
[2:43:06] shadowymisstep: LOOOOOL
[2:43:20] shadowymisstep: Hey I hate ragging on individuals but
[2:43:21] pikachauchu: KEKW
[2:43:26] shadowymisstep: Common variables exist
[2:43:30] vincentive_: TL always at least did decent whenver they brought in players to play with CoreJJ
[2:43:34] AuSBoX_TTV: vlcnDIFF
[2:43:59] vincentive_: TL def did a lot better than expected at worlds
[2:44:16] shadowymisstep: The fact they got to Worlds at all was a miracle imo
[2:44:21] Noreason_4: @shadowymisstep yeah
[2:44:27] Noreason_4: and now APA has a mid coach to improve
[2:44:30] Noreason_4: so they could be scary
[2:44:34] shadowymisstep: Like three different teams imploded
[2:44:40] pikachauchu: Anything LCS in international is a miracle nowadays
[2:44:54] Noreason_4: I have a feeling its T1 Skyy who is his coach because its supposedly a Korean coach
[2:45:02] vincentive_: Let's be real, though Pyosik had an insane worlds run
[2:45:10] ichiwin: better koreans win?
[2:45:13] Noreason_4: and Sky speaks english and is the only coach to not be re-signed to T1
[2:45:20] pikachauchu: @vincentive_ I don't think anyone said he didn't
[2:45:39] shadowymisstep: Pyosik played out of his mind poor guy
[2:45:46] BallsyEagle: peepoClap
[2:45:52] shadowymisstep: Also I assume TL will announce this week before the season starts?
[2:45:57] shadowymisstep: ??? Hopefully??
[2:46:00] vincentive_: He went from middle of the pack lcs jg to world champ caliber so quickly lol
[2:46:13] shadowymisstep: I respect turning it on when it matters tbh
[2:46:24] shadowymisstep: Like it's pretty obvious he didn't give that much of a shit about LCS
[2:46:32] pikachauchu: Pyosik always been that player though very streaky. And sometimes just clicks
[2:46:49] shadowymisstep: We'll see how he does on KT
[2:46:55] Noreason_4: well he better turn it up on kt cuz his team sucks
[2:46:59] vincentive_: Yeah, that was like one of his biggest criticisms and why people questioned the tl pickup
[2:47:12] shadowymisstep: I CAN'T wait for LCK to come back
[2:47:17] pikachauchu: I watched lots of LCK so yea
[2:47:21] Noreason_4: FAKEGOD
[2:47:23] Noreason_4: REALGOD
[2:47:26] ichiwin: bugi gap
[2:47:33] treesdied: @ultra4774 Kt roster isnt even that bad though
[2:47:39] Noreason_4: shopify winning lcs clearlyt
[2:47:45] Noreason_4: @ultra4774 no theyre bad
[2:47:51] vincentive_: Isn't LCK ridiculously stacked?
[2:48:03] vincentive_: I remember LPL is in like limbo or something
[2:48:06] pikachauchu: how is that KT team bad bruh
[2:48:08] pikachauchu: wat
[2:48:08] Noreason_4: deft is mid, beryl is bad, pyosik is mid, bdd is good and their top is a mid table rookie

[2:49:33] MagicNickBall: Winning 2 world champs proves he's good lmao
[2:49:41] Noreason_4: nocturne moment
[2:49:41] pikachauchu: bro is comparing 3 worlds from a different skill level
[2:49:47] shadowymisstep: Okay chat who's winning the LCK this split let's stop while we're ahead I'm going to get a migraine
[2:49:51] vincentive_: it's not proving he's good but definitely proving he isn't bad

[2:51:10] Noreason_4: but
[2:51:17] MagicNickBall: as a FNC fan I have to agree G2 is just a notch better
[2:51:18] shadowymisstep: G2 def feels like the strongest team but I hope Heretics brings it back a little bit
