[4:52:54] Ottigan: Tbf, a gold or lower vs a master would get demolished in most lane matchups.

[4:55:53] Galkaria: the game was better when last pick was forced to support. you -had- to know all the roles or you were just a blanket bad player
[4:56:14] Ottigan: Dunno, just checked Aphelios op.gg. He actually pops off most of his recent games. Going 19/11, 17/6 adn 19/5
[4:56:24] keshaluvr69: OTP's usually choose harder champions so their mastery ACTUALLY matters
[4:56:25] leothedorito: Nunu would be another @Wingsofdeath

[4:57:09] Ottigan: But it is never about the champ, it is about matchup. Not knowing how to play vs Pyke, Blitz, Fizz, etc.
[4:57:35] leothedorito: From playing top a lot , just learning wave state and when to do shit does most of the work
[4:57:40] fefe1232dw: They sure got good practice.
[4:57:51] leothedorito: mechanics and fundamentals > matchups
[4:58:00] leothedorito: cause you aint winnin shit without it
[4:58:06] ftUncleDrew: matchup in jg literally means nothing bronzies
[4:58:33] Ottigan: Well, J4 was pretty much afk. But this is more about him not knowing how plan his pathing and recalls
[4:58:39] Batman_NEU19: to be fair, apparently fiddle is lpl legend uzi Clueless
[4:58:49] Ottigan: My comment was about solo lanes.
[4:58:58] MadSpectre47: just give us some good ults pls
[4:59:05] MadSpectre47: turn a fight or two
[4:59:20] InhumaneJEKyLL: Totally agree
[4:59:46] christiankuhn3: @ftUncleDrew nah jgl matchups are still important
[4:59:59] fefe1232dw: That practice will help them for next game Kappa
[5:00:10] walmartimport: Its funny that people still think Tenacity Works against knockups as form of CC
[5:00:21] ftUncleDrew: @christiankuhn3 absolutely doesn’t
[5:00:46] leothedorito: Pretty sure anything that stops cc doesnt work with airborne
[5:00:50] christiankuhn3: i know this particular matchup isnt but i mean as a general thats not true

[5:01:16] kroova2: !rank
[5:01:17] LoLRankBot: Wingsofdeath is Emerald III 0 LP

[5:01:36] allesSternenstaub: tft and snack?
[5:01:42] christiankuhn3: nope, every junglers have certain jungle weaknesses and weak matchups, doesnt mean its an insta loss
[5:02:01] MadSpectre47: when i used to play, and i was always shit at cs, my "friends" would tell me to always practice CS with Vlad
[5:02:03] ftUncleDrew: never said it did, try reading next time

[5:02:30] christiankuhn3: your point is jungle matchups aren't important is it not?
[5:02:31] walmartimport: But still people pick Legend: Tenacity rune over others vs knockups just lazy maybe
[5:02:38] leothedorito: @christiankuhn3 Matchups only matter when ppl are at the same skill lvl- when they arent its knowledge and mechanics
[5:02:44] ftUncleDrew: correct
[5:03:53] MadSpectre47: maybe half a wave?
[5:03:54] Seifferon: 3 maybe 4 creeps
[5:03:55] MadSpectre47: a wave tops?
[5:03:56] cyberlapse: couple minions
