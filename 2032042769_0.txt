[3:26:44] Kinkou_Order: tbh i agree on that
[3:26:49] IncognitoBambi: Can u show healing and shielding of the last game?
[3:26:57] Kaazea: maybe make a new spell and lock the item to it? like jungle item
[3:27:18] Lazynameross: but they gave item numbers and still had to beg ppl in patch notes to stop griefing their builds/skill orders etc regardless
[3:27:34] Lazynameross: this just makes people who actually like and care about the numbers feel bad

[6:47:55] quincy_chan: more teemo fappySleep
[6:48:39] Kadius: Taric also pairs very well with the lethality adcs like samira/nilah that are strong atm
[6:48:54] xxcrankxx93: What do we think about Hwei Support Mr strimmer?
[6:49:18] pyrosui: I feel like taric is a hard champ to balance. So much of his power value is in his ultimate.
[6:49:52] Drizzel1506: He got buffs in the hotfix already
[6:49:54] kairin_: I need to learn to cook really well so I never eat out
[6:50:00] dorylian: it's strong with trynd or kindred
[6:50:02] kairin_: But sometimes you just get fed up of your own food
[6:50:02] xxcrankxx93: https://twitter.com/SharpeLeague/status/1746189343717302709?t=u2LttysKdv_HJFlBoepxXw&s=19 sharpeleague made this post
[6:50:04] V1PMONKEY: problem is not just his ultimate but that you actually need to coordinate with your teammates and thats the bigger issue ppl just run away instead of stun
[6:50:10] matjee: So Hwei support viable then? ^^
[6:50:17] StepLively: what if taric q gave ms based on stacks
[6:50:20] montherkk: Galio so good i play him alote vs ap supp  and buy this iteam that give u ap sheld  he is unkillable
[6:50:21] pyrosui: @kairin_ it's a lot easier once you got the fundamentals down <3
[6:50:35] Kaazea: hwei game?
[6:51:17] kairin_: @pyrosui I cook a lot but it‚Äôs more like after a while I just don‚Äôt want to keep eating my food lol sometimes you just want someone to cook for you haha
[6:51:31] YunhoeeAteez: @stunt I laughed at you for having a bad haircut and now my barber fucked me up too.... you put a hex on me or sumthng
