[2:46:49] demonminer3: @gsjan except i dont feel like i have any control in that. its just so difficult to farm, survive, and coordinate with suport. and lately, the supports have been going full carry anyways, so whats the point of me even playing, when they objectively are better suited for what i am queuing up for?
[2:47:00] immaculate_leroy: thoughts on experimental hexplate? Seems like a great item for Trundle
[2:47:01] bigAL935: @yutipa it looked only once a second

[2:47:39] surjaguar: is really?
[2:47:41] demonminer3: yeah, i know
[2:47:47] gsjan: realize how many mistakes everyone in your games make and learn to capitalize off them
[2:47:58] gsjan: watch high elo gameplay and familiarize yourself with what good gameplay is
[2:48:15] gsjan: go into practice tool and just cs, use an intermediate AI if you can handle it
[2:48:22] Hewyy: !nasus
[2:48:22] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists

[2:58:03] a38w87: BIG
[2:58:12] Laika93: Rookern is honestly best item they've introduced for a long time.
[2:58:18] Lazmare: Yi doing YI things
[2:58:29] gsjan: @Laika93 real
[2:58:32] glandayzer_: @TrundleTop1 build Kaenic_Rookern
[2:58:43] bigAL935: the item that gives the magic damage shield out of combat is actually nuts
[2:58:43] Laika93: Also, I'd like it if they balanced akali by moving more of her power to her passive rather than Q/E
[2:58:45] PortuguesePai: Whats really annoying with Akali is that Ignite says it gives you vision of the person for 5seconds, yet in her Shroud you still can't see her.
[2:58:57] r1_solid: @TrundleTop1  do u use movement perdiction
[2:59:06] gsjan: @PortuguesePai arent vision and true sight  different
[2:59:15] truly_ancient_truly_evil: yea
[2:59:20] truly_ancient_truly_evil: akali has true invis
[2:59:31] PortuguesePai: that's pretty lame
[2:59:32] Mattmattah: @PortuguesePai there are 2 state of invisibility in league: camouflage and invis. Ignite only counter the weakest, akali has the best state of the 2
[2:59:39] bigAL935: cant even SNIFFA her through shroud
[2:59:44] Mattmattah: i dont remember which one is wich ^^
[2:59:45] gonzo5: no one picks up cinders?
[2:59:48] fhgig: is hull breaker good?
[3:00:02] kaphari: good morning
[3:00:04] finko57: @fhgig bad
[3:00:19] Laika93: The hull breaker changes are interesting.
[3:00:21] bigAL935: @gonzo5 they arnt that good .. u need way too many to have a noticable difference
[3:00:24] Laika93: But it's definitely weaker
[3:00:33] demonminer3: @gsjan yeah, that is true. i just wish that... idk. i wish i could just... be good enough to make up for everything i do, ya know? like, i do the best i can, and i can only go even in lane for one reason or another. but then i just get one shot trying to do something.

[3:03:27] Laika93: Terminus is an interesting item but it requires 12 autos to fully stack,. and you must hit champs, doesn't stack off minions.

[3:03:42] Nightbot: does more magic dmg than physical dont trade, RUN right away when he uses E once its down ur fine
[3:03:43] demonminer3: @gsjan yeah. just need to be better. one thing i def need to work on, is i tend to go too aggro. like, i want to trade aggressively cuz my champ can do that (jhin) but i just need to chill. like youi saidm farm well and ill kill anyone anyways
[3:03:44] LangTheBoss: @bigal935 but you can see where she is from DoT so worth
[3:03:46] gsjan: @Laika93 its done easily for trundle and it snowballs

[3:03:58] gsjan: its like an offensive jak sho
[3:04:00] ACodeUnknown: If you have rageblade and attackspeed already it's pretty decent tbh
[3:04:07] heimerdingergott: !builds
[3:04:11] Codicium: @bigAL935 sad, feels like there should be at least one tool that gives true vision
[3:04:21] gsjan: @demonminer3 something that's really helped me is committing to the idea that if im not sure itll work, i dont do it
[3:04:29] gsjan: you really gotta catch yourself on it though
[3:04:29] fhgig: @Laika93 are the stacks dissapear one at a time or all at once?
[3:04:40] longclaw19: you need life steal, no?
[3:04:40] bigAL935: @Codicium such is the way or riot
[3:04:41] demonminer3: @gsjan i do that! im just, too sure too often LUL
[3:04:59] bluebonnetrs: have you tried the new hullbreaker?

[3:09:51] Elie1900: sorry for the long message
[3:09:59] demonminer3: @gsjan best to secure vision before trrades in case of jungle interference, mind the wavestate, and keep track of summs and hold them till you are 100% sure they are worth using, or at the first sign of danger
[3:10:00] TIESTO_GLADIATOR: !yorick

[3:36:16] Nightbot: just stay in ur wave so it pushes to u when he qs u. wait for them to use their passive on a minion. Dodge the sweetspots it worth cancelling an auto dodge. Once you get hull just push ignore him and hit tower.

[3:36:40] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm
