[0:21:01] SaintBlarney: @Asheetomalph Did you drink enough energy drinks before playing? How about eating enough candy? Could be you didn't get enough of both...
[0:21:05] kris_O: Wtf? It's one of the best seasons. Why headache?
[0:21:24] Flobot75: how do you figure out when a good back timing is
[0:21:54] lardyparty: !playlist
[0:22:03] lardyparty: NotLikeThis
[0:22:51] SaintBlarney: @Flobot75 In general you want to back when the wave is pushed into the enemy tower...AND you figure they can't push it back faster than you can walk back. Most of the early backs can be done when you have a cannon wave at their tower...or one coming next while the wave is at their tower.
[0:23:05] kris_O: Flobot. When you have money to buy something. When your minions are pushing and by the time you come back the enemy can't push to your tower

[5:33:02] Kroptik: @Daugger Normal Kappa
[5:33:10] MedicGordus: I stay in Diamond or lower so my queue times don't go forever and a lot less chance to autofill

[5:33:17] Daugger: Everyone who has played a game of ranked is better then me.
[5:33:17] Justissier: Plus plus
[5:33:45] MedicGordus: My two primary accounts I keep them in silver and bronze so the queue times stay below 10 minutes

[5:35:56] Quizmo96: Jhin Support EZ Clap
[5:36:18] Kroptik: @Daugger Not true, unrank people are usually matched with silver people for placements, so unranked is basically silver.
[5:36:59] MedicGordus: Unranked players are not silver, they are unranked
[5:37:14] Quizmo96: I play a normal game sitting on Bronze 2 and I get matched with Diamonds and Master Players.
[5:37:18] Kroptik: I'm not saying they are, I'm saying they're considered silver in terms of matchmaking.
[5:37:37] tvDuende: 4 KEKW
[5:37:38] Chillabreh: why...
[5:37:46] Chillabreh: they must really not like you
[5:37:58] Kroptik: Also, have you seen iron 4 players? Some of them are genuinely bad rooKek
[5:38:01] Justissier: johnathan?
[5:38:06] MedicGordus: Don't play LoL for competitive purposes, the matchmaking system is the most broken system ever designed by humankind. 99% of games are predetermined before anyone chooses a champion.

[5:38:37] paaaanda1: if i wanted to have fun i'd play a different game Kappa
[5:38:58] Daugger: But the hidden mmr is still lower then that. Don't they have silver placements to just determine skill level and not actual rank?
[5:39:26] filarette: what is that red circle in lower right corner of map?
[5:40:03] Kroptik: I think there might be more to hidden MMR than that... I usually play against emeralds in normals and I've never been above gold 5 when I played ranked....
[5:40:23] Chillabreh: that ks from jhin supp
[5:40:26] MISIM: not +12 Sadge

[5:47:19] StreamElements: The Multi-Raffle has ended and punisher_demon, daugger, spentacular13 won 1666 stacks each KasugaYeah
[5:47:30] MedicGordus: I don't take kills when I queue solo, if the rest of the team doesn't kill them I let them go
[5:47:42] 1demonhunter: where did he go ?
[5:47:42] MedicGordus: It makes people in ranked so mad
[5:47:58] Quizmo96: I was playing in ranked because I would play a normal game against a diamond mid yasuo or something and I'm like
[5:48:03] Quizmo96: Im not gonna learn this way
[5:48:06] Kroptik: @Quizmo96 Remember that adc/mid/top are somewhat similar roles. Support and jungle are not like each other or like the other three.
[5:48:07] Quizmo96: LUL
[5:48:41] Kroptik: Adc/mid/top, you just farm and hopefully carry.... Support is very different in that you're not "supposed" to be the carry or get fed.
[5:48:48] MedicGordus: Support and jungle change the most every season, it's almost like relearning the entire game most times
[5:49:16] Kroptik: Also, most jungle and support mains suck at farming, so they end up falling behind when they play adc/mid/top.
[5:49:47] Quizmo96: @Kroptik I was thinking of playing stacking champions like veigar or nasus because they have a simple play style.
[5:49:53] Quizmo96: stack to win right?
[5:50:11] MedicGordus: I have only ever played support, no matter what happens. When I autofill, I always dodge even if I get banned
[5:50:14] tvDuende: yo where's chris?
[5:50:20] Kroptik: Yes, but you have to stack fast enough to be able to carry with a stacking champ...
[5:50:26] MedicGordus: Chris said brb @tvduende
[5:50:34] Quizmo96: true
[5:50:41] Kroptik: If you're at 200 stacks at 35 minutes on Nasus, you're not doing much LUL
[5:51:05] Quizmo96: I know but they have a easy game plan every game.

[5:51:07] Quizmo96: yk?
[5:51:16] Chillabreh: easy game plan on paper
[5:51:34] Chillabreh: usually people know youre playing a stacking champ and try to prevent you from stacking
[5:51:46] Quizmo96: True
[5:51:51] Kroptik: @Quizmo96 I guess, yeah.... When I get autofilled, I just like to play safe champs to make it easy for others to carry me. LUL (Like Malz in mid lane)
[5:52:05] Chillabreh: but sure why not veigar is a good pick
[5:52:13] Chillabreh: nasus too honestly
[5:52:27] Chillabreh: just play w/e interests you
[5:52:39] MedicGordus: If you get autofilled just dodge. If it is ranked, make sure to have at least 20 accounts so bans don't impact you
[5:53:14] Quizmo96: Oh honestly I wanna play a solo lane yeah? but my best friend that I play ranked with is a Million MP Garen top
[5:53:21] Quizmo96: so I only have mid to play.
[5:53:23] Kroptik: @MedicGordus Dude, like I said, I play normals... I'm not dodging anything LUL If I get autofilled, I asked to switch, if no switch, I just have fun instead.
[5:53:32] tvDuende: SUPLEX!!
[5:54:00] MedicGordus: Just dodge man, isn't worth wasting time playing something you didn't want to. Plus, dodging forces rito to fix unfun roles
[5:54:16] Quizmo96: @Chillabreh What would you recommend me to play midlane?
[5:54:19] MedicGordus: People who do not dodge, greatly hurt the game
[5:54:26] MedicGordus: (when autofilled)
[5:54:47] Kroptik: @MedicGordus I disagreem but whatever.
[5:54:57] Whirlingdeath: chat what game is this?
[5:54:58] StreamElements: @Whirlingdeath, Chris is currently playing "Fate/Samurai Remnant" while in queue, followed by "Yakuza 8 if its out". As always, he is streaming League of Legends.
[5:55:23] Kroptik: Though I do wish riot would implement some sort of "don't autofill me" thing, even if it led to longer queues.
[5:55:52] MedicGordus: It's a fact, think about it: When people do not dodge, rito see low queue times. If everyone who autofilled dodged, the queue time for the nine players who did not autofill would at least double their queue time and they would then be able to see which roles are unfun
[5:56:00] Chillabreh: @Quizmo96 mmm fizz, ekko, and veigar probably
[5:56:34] MedicGordus: Rito doesn't have a single analyst working for them, they only look at plain numbers

[5:58:10] Chillabreh: @Quizmo96 yea ekko is hard champ to get into but really good if you can play him
[5:58:36] Chillabreh: @Quizmo96 anivia is also a solid pick
[5:59:16] MedicGordus: There are roles that people avoid, if you play ranked you will get autofilled to a single role every single game. It changes from season to season tho. One season I played 711 games as support. 270 of those games autofilled into jungle (no other role)
[5:59:21] Quizmo96: Anivia has like one of the best waveclear tools yeah?
[5:59:37] StreamElements:  Check out my latest TikTok :) : https://www.tiktok.com/@sirhcezofficial
[5:59:38] MedicGordus: My average queue time that season was 28 minutes
[6:00:14] Quizmo96: Also sorry if I'm overloading you with too many questions.
[6:00:21] Chillabreh: @Quizmo96 yea makes it hard for enemy team to siege your base too
[6:00:22] Quizmo96: I can chill XD
[6:00:31] Kroptik: @MedicGordus I main support as well and was mostly autofilled to top though.... I know I almost never got jungle cos it's a role I can't play and the few times I got it, I was always able to trade.
[6:00:32] Chillabreh: nah you good
[6:00:38] Quizmo96: @Chillabreh That's interesting..
[6:01:26] Kroptik: @MedicGordus Then again, you probably play ranked... maybe not even on the same server as me... so our experiences will differ.
[6:01:35] Kroptik: I don't get long queues in normals LUL

But if you don't mind shopping, i recommand saving the recipe cards and possibly shopping for your own stuff in the future.  Ends up cheaper.  But of course that's scenario dependent
