[2:44:24] Shuuyaa: @fuugato if you think hes so out of line that it warrants a reaction you can report his stream or report him to riot with the game id, but again playing moral highground "oh why are you flaming dont flame" when hes obviously tilted is just cringe
[2:44:36] Shuuyaa: youre like trying to make some rational point when hes clearly not in a rational zone

[2:47:42] persimini: @shuuyaa based explanation, couldn't say it better myself
[2:47:48] Artless_s: Doesn't the build depend a lot on enemy comp? I feel like kata can just build 50 items
[2:48:06] aussiefeast: it
[2:48:18] TheGesterr: gives good movespeed too
[2:48:18] HetzxD_: movespeed also good
[2:48:23] AB2fps: how did they nerf stormsurge
[2:48:35] koyommi: kat evolved runs storm first and says nashors first is good but js not as good as storm
[2:48:41] fabnoyx: its good snowball item kinda w flat pen + the burst
[2:48:44] Shuuyaa: i mean its 25% less scaling and like 20% less base damage
[2:48:49] Shuuyaa: its a pretty bad nerf
[2:49:06] Bom6aA: WIDESEXO
[2:49:07] Charcoalll: what about storm  second

[2:49:34] myprecioussosnowy: yea that's the shadowflame dark harvest
[2:49:34] HetzxD_: @Shuuyaa who cares if it was a bad nerf it was deserved, its still a very strong item
[2:49:35] fabnoyx: wtf
[2:49:36] Shuuyaa: it went for 120-260+40% to 100-200+30%
[2:49:44] owi181: hahaha such a nice Sound 😂😂
[2:50:02] togglescript: TONIGHT THE MUSIC SEEMS SO LOUD
[2:50:04] Tearofpain3: @JustOmelette glass canon even with titabic hydra
[2:50:10] Shuuyaa: @HetzxD_ it wasnt even particularly good on kat even before the nerf unless you were already significantly ahead
[2:50:24] JustOmelette: @Tearofpain3 but it is one hell of a cannon lmfao
[2:50:25] HetzxD_: @Shuuyaa false
[2:50:35] Tearofpain3: @JustOmelette thats true
[2:50:36] Artless_s: Just go nashors into whatever is good against enemy comp smh
[2:50:37] Bom6aA: @togglescript it's just playing on your soul SEXO
[2:50:58] typing_with_one_hand: i think im in love
[2:51:14] Shuuyaa: @HetzxD_ the item was only good if you built it towards late midgame as like 3rd or 4th when you could get the aoe proc in teamfights
[2:51:20] Artless_s: @typing_with_one_hand 10/10 name
[2:51:40] typing_with_one_hand: @Artless_s i am

[2:51:56] jashtsty: holy
[2:52:05] shripell: ýea always crits
[2:52:16] 0Huh: IS KATA OP?
[2:52:17] HeartlessOmer: IE makes the crit stronger as well
[2:52:22] Shuuyaa: im actually curious if infinity edge bonus crit damage applies to that
[2:52:31] myprecioussosnowy: @shuuyaa it does
[2:52:37] Rutury: +20% crit Sadge
[2:52:37] HeartlessOmer: @Shuuyaa It does
