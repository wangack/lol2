[0:09:59] ark0sic: im the same way. sunday long run always leaves me with the WORST sleep before monday
[0:10:07] thedubbleblue: Why did u switch ur perma ban?
[0:10:29] gr3yc4rd1n4l: may be should go a little heavier on the gym
[0:10:52] thedubbleblue: Oh i thought ur perma was Vayne
[0:10:56] Dezrunner: Fresh air man, get near/on the water... knocks me out every time
[0:11:05] gr3yc4rd1n4l: and do gym later in the evening
[0:11:20] axcitarjr: With the new season, regardless of it's patch / hotfixes. What are the top junglers to climb this rank split? I've put Graves Lillia Hecarim into my champ pool already LUL
[0:11:23] Nordexa: What do you think about J4 right now? Do you think he fell behind because of all lethality? @Santorin
[0:11:26] gr3yc4rd1n4l: or earlier depends on your body
[0:12:25] axcitarjr: I've seen a lot of Nunu though not sure if he got buffed or anything
[0:12:37] stslimited84: Briar lethality strong ye?
[0:12:59] Nordexa: Damn, i really enjoyed playing him. I've revolved around my playstyle about punishing flash CD, looks like i need to find another champion that does that as well as j4
[0:13:25] Sylik16: have you tried jax jungle? I heard it was good
[0:13:39] axcitarjr: Mid-day gym are always good, but that depends on the crowd LUL
[0:14:10] Nordexa: Yeah i picked him to literally anything, that was so fun not gonna lie..
[0:14:41] goldenzazou: best jungler for climbing?
[0:14:52] Azmod3ous: Might be seeing full burst lethality J4 again like we did a few seaasons ago.
[0:15:08] gr3yc4rd1n4l: jax, zyra and kindred are the top list  in master+ world wide
[0:15:09] studboy68: lethality j4 is dog
[0:15:27] Azmod3ous: is it?
[0:15:30] balanceiaga: !delay

[0:16:25] studboy68: I mean you can 1 shot squishies but only q and r benefit from ad/lethality there’s champs that do it better is all

[0:17:27] Azmod3ous: @studboy68 fair but there was once upon a time ap j4 was top tier support XD
[0:17:40] Sylik16: i feel like if you get the 6 voildings its so strong early game for farming plates and getting a lead
[0:17:50] axcitarjr: iirc gryffin said that the first grub holds the most EXP so even if you don't get all of them is fine
[0:18:36] studboy68: what’s hidden op about j4 is his q has armor shred so going cdr and then tank is really good
[0:19:34] guiltyprawn: Praise the teacher kaypHYPERS
[0:20:14] gr3yc4rd1n4l: 1 for 1 at least

[2:04:05] 444Kanin: Especially when u have the support roaming to them 5 minutes into the game.
[2:04:13] gr3yc4rd1n4l: BOT LANERS are special breed of retards
[2:04:34] Captainfordie: @444Kanin yeah they're so strong that I would give up 2 drags every time if I could get grubs twice

[2:42:02] DanielFromBrazil1: Bruh, WHY every game for you is on Extreme hard mode? @Santorin
[2:42:19] LordGam: are you going to costream LEC?
[2:43:10] gr3yc4rd1n4l: what o you mean you are not allowed to?
[2:43:23] auri_sariel: he can do the costream like dom, he cant stream the matches but he can just react to it
[2:43:35] thedubbleblue: He can liveview
[2:43:36] auri_sariel: @gr3yc4rd1n4l you need permission from riot  games for costreaming due to copyright
[2:43:39] thedubbleblue: but cant co stream
[2:44:29] auri_sariel: @gr3yc4rd1n4l so he would have to request riot games to give him costream rights
[2:45:12] thedubbleblue: What i heard from caedrel is
[2:45:21] thedubbleblue: tthat u need to be part of an ORG to co stream
[2:45:38] auri_sariel: @thedubbleblue yeah thats possible, LEC has much stricter rules for costreaming than LCS
[2:46:13] thedubbleblue: prob also why caedrel joined fnc
[2:49:20] gr3yc4rd1n4l: thanks
[2:49:51] gr3yc4rd1n4l: @auri_sariel thanks !

[3:00:15] DenFedeKonge: u knew allready man, how will varus + ori ever hit xin + gwen frontline
[3:00:44] tuRkytreaT: play Brand?
[3:01:06] thedubbleblue: Rumble game?
[3:01:18] tuRkytreaT: rumble banned unfortunately
[3:01:27] koushik_10: ?

[3:02:10] DenFedeKonge: how many poits soloQ atm?
[3:02:15] DenFedeKonge: points
[3:02:34] Saturn_Seven: sometimes you just gotta run it down with the boys
[3:02:53] alabamahammer02: i think the current R1 is a nunu jg
[3:03:18] tuRkytreaT: :)
[3:03:38] auri_sariel: why everyone decided to play singed on this 14.1 patch? everytime i see a singed they get crushed
[3:03:51] DenFedeKonge: true, if my team votes for chaos comb, i go heimer top and hope for chaos ^^
[3:03:55] BleachIceCream: wait what
[3:03:58] BleachIceCream: what happened
[3:04:01] thugnifcent007: Kha
[3:04:02] Saturn_Seven: wait what happened?
[3:04:10] balanceiaga: how does one drop hack champion select
[3:04:10] BleachIceCream: ??
[3:04:28] balanceiaga: lolll
[3:04:35] BleachIceCream: awesome lol
[3:04:39] balanceiaga: It's OP though
[3:04:40] auri_sariel: cant wait for vanguard finally dropping so they cant do this shiet

[3:05:09] DenFedeKonge: last heimer game, i was 75 cs vs 29 cs ornn.. it is acturly good as long enemy jungler prefer to play botside :)
[3:05:20] mkramer2000: That's unfortunate. You would think that they would have a way to limit what cokes to thebserver from one end
[3:05:28] auri_sariel: with vanguard if they launch that drophack thats instantl perma ban
[3:06:10] alabamahammer02: Any wild changes in the meta by Koreans?
[3:06:14] balanceiaga: but its pretty invasive though
[3:06:43] balanceiaga: Riot can see all your "homework"
[3:06:54] auri_sariel: @balanceiaga vanguard is no different how deep authority it has over ur pc than like 80% of all anti cheats, vanguard just got shiet on for no reason called out
[3:07:21] xiahoupure_phil: hey santorin
[3:07:27] mkramer2000: I can't wait to see what comes up with in the LCS. I'm sure Flyquest will have some crazy drafts with Bwipo on the team
[3:07:29] auri_sariel: like 80% of all anti cheats are launched to kernel level
[3:07:33] auri_sariel: same like vanguard
[3:07:48] DenFedeKonge: since support items stack up so quickly i would say starting doran shield or maybe ruby could work, if it give  you potential to trade early and get control
[3:08:01] iiNumb3rz: Can we do a prediction if they will ban draven away from hans sama? I want to 2x my santorinis
[3:08:20] mkramer2000: Bwipo on his stream said he has played 4 different champs that didn't get a single band last year so
[3:08:27] mkramer2000: Ban*
[3:08:38] auri_sariel: like if ure playing genshin ure already getting the same invading anti cheat like vanguard
[3:08:54] alabamahammer02: Is there an app or website that lets you enter item builds and it will spit out total damage or dps?
[3:09:38] alabamahammer02: oh
[3:09:48] alabamahammer02: true
[3:09:59] alabamahammer02: alabamahammer02 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:11:00] alabamahammer02: Love the stream, good vibes!
[3:11:01] thedubbleblue: Santorin i was thinking isnt nashors good on Rumble since his passive overhead?
[3:11:17] auri_sariel: im gonna move to watching LEC, cant wait to watch you again Santorini! hopefully one day il see you on the analyst desk!
[3:12:18] thugnifcent007: Kha
[3:12:22] auri_sariel: Soraka is pretty good at stopping katarinas R though
[3:12:44] alabamahammer02: @auri_sariel open a 2nd tab santorinSad
[3:13:01] auri_sariel: @alabamahammer02 i do have it like that but il probably mute this tab even if il have it open :C
[3:13:08] thedubbleblue: yeah i am doing exactly that rn @alabamahammer02  lol
[3:13:16] alabamahammer02: <3
[3:13:25] thedubbleblue: but i will prob mute it aswell ngl
[3:14:13] tugwos: so gank jungle!
[3:14:19] auri_sariel: look at the good side santorini! Sorakas E can completely cancel Katarinas R! @Santorin
[3:14:48] wanpies: haha
[3:15:00] darkgaurdian07: How did this game manage to make jungler even more important than it already was
[3:15:06] alabamahammer02: my bronze games don't even start this bad KEKHeim
[3:15:29] auri_sariel: @alabamahammer02 same not even in plat/emerald for me KEKW
[3:15:39] alabamahammer02: maybe stream snipers
[3:16:06] alabamahammer02: lmao
[3:16:07] alabamahammer02: singed
[3:16:21] auri_sariel: thats just a fast recall
[3:16:32] alabamahammer02: wait is singed proxying...i didn't see

[3:17:31] d1a_lol: why was soraka pathing bot
[3:17:33] d1a_lol: oh my fucking lord

[3:17:44] DanielFromBrazil1: P A I N @Santorin
[3:17:45] auri_sariel: THIS IS WHAT I MEAN, whenever theres a singed they get crushed XD
[3:18:22] alabamahammer02: I honestly don't know how Singed actually works in high ELO... just don't chase him xD
[3:19:03] auri_sariel: @alabamahammer02 singed can be used as a really good zoning and engange champ but  95% of all singed players i met were really bad
[3:19:23] Nyanra: Deadass
[3:20:42] DanielFromBrazil1: JUNGLE DIFF

[3:23:11] Xcyther: its joever
[3:23:22] auri_sariel: @Santorin you cant directly costream the matches but u can do it like dom, dont stream teh matches but you can watch it and react to it on stream
[3:24:00] auri_sariel: people are really curious on ur reactions :3
[3:25:25] Interceptor_hero: what do the grubs do?
[3:25:52] DanielFromBrazil1: true damage on tower
[3:26:44] runer_2xc: I ended last season emerald and this season I placed plat 2 and got emerald in 2 days. that's good right?
[3:26:51] auri_sariel: ah yes, first game and we have a game delay due to technical issues KEKW
[3:28:55] Nyanra: you're just 1 guy less on the team and 1 lane of farm goes to waste Shruge

[3:35:09] auri_sariel: @Santorin are you suggesting to the chat they should start running it down to win games?
[3:35:11] Sevax: @Santorin Is black cleaver good even tho the enemy team isn't going for lots of armor?

[3:39:33] Sevax: @alabamahammer02 The thing is, I refrain from getting Black Cleaver when the enemy team isn't going armor, I am genuinely curious if I should be getting black cleaver when I am not against tanky champs
[3:40:13] auri_sariel: @Sevax for sure sometimes you do, some champs even if they dont build armor have high base armor and good armor scaling per level, sometimes u need it even if they dont build full armor
[3:40:19] HaloOfSpores: Steraks last?
