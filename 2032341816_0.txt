[0:12:33] JackJonesOff: lux buff is great you don't feel as lane bullied as you used to, however the current lethal jungle items make her very squishylike

[0:15:28] mrry2k: if everyone does a lot of damage no one does a lot of damage !
[0:15:33] Vladpopvv: i think it's a season of "one shot lethality and magic pen". I just played Ashe vs lethality jhin and i can't play the game. Thank god they surrendered cuz they had an afk
[0:15:35] Azmod3ous: would you say overall the games last longer like intended?
[0:15:40] jimbob_ywert: @littlejellyfishy indeed that is me. I’m currently training well in the base grounds for my next battle (the game after this) wish me well!
[0:15:43] TWanderer: I was playing Leona .... I killed 4 people at full hp and no one else was around
[0:15:45] rouillr: Hello hello !
[0:15:45] JackJonesOff: i wish they did something about this 3sec deathscene into tp :/

[0:18:01] jimbob_ywert: who’s your favorite champion based on lore u know of?
[0:18:25] nezha_00: I have had to perma ban eve because the map is so wide open now she just can walk into midlane whenever and 1 shot me feels awful
[0:18:36] ericaborgest: so close

[0:19:52] SpringSong: yea only Maw to suck all my lux combos dmg
[0:19:57] saschatelepath: saschatelepath is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to KayPea's community! They've gifted a total of 19 in the channel! 
[0:19:57] plaugecat: if only they stacked
[0:19:57] saschatelepath: saschatelepath gifted a Tier 1 sub to Napskee! 
[0:20:04] plaugecat: bloom but u cant have both
[0:20:05] lewhitehd69: @amethyst_art22 wake her up Wokege she needs to see this
[0:20:06] ericaborgest: is it stormsurge?
[0:20:09] QTwinkyyy: Cryptbloom is percentage
[0:20:18] Hattnissen: Cryptbloom or whatever it's named
[0:20:23] ericaborgest: oh Cryptbloom
[0:20:30] SpringSong: crypto is trash
[0:20:31] amethyst_art22: @lewhitehd69 fam she got to see Freya doing magic lmao
[0:20:33] ericaborgest: triple lol
[0:20:37] nippietassel: sooo we goin lava form or?
[0:20:44] nippietassel: or magma*
[0:20:49] SpringSong: you give 10 ap and %10 mpen for only 15 cdr
[0:20:54] plaugecat: its really good on some champs
[0:20:56] lewhitehd69: @amethyst_art22 well she had to learn about birds and bees sometime right? kaypAyyy
[0:21:08] plaugecat: @SpringSong and the heal
[0:21:20] Martybggg: What's also crazy is that when stormsurge was somewhat a good item it insta got nerfed.
[0:21:21] amethyst_art22: @lewis 2 years ild too early? LUL
[0:21:35] QTwinkyyy: I personally like Cryptbloom it feels super nice on characters who build Liandry's love it on Zyra and Morgana
[0:21:36] jimbob_ywert: what I’m finding interesting lately is how easy it is to come back in games that seems like it’s a loss. and it’s always the games where my team has GOOD mentality and scaling where we actually comeback compared to the whiners who wanna ff and go next when they’re not in the lead early on 24/7. I believe it has to do with peoples attention spans these days. kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti
[0:21:39] SpringSong: @plaugecat yea 150 hp heal can do anything againts everyones 1k dmg
[0:21:41] QPixie: what I dont understand is why lethality items are so much  cheaper than mage items
[0:21:53] plaugecat: @SpringSong its like 450 late game
[0:21:57] plaugecat: and it does a lot
[0:22:00] ericaborgest: I've been seeing lots of seraphine supp
[0:22:26] BadInGood: chat, is there any way to find out the name of the track that is playing?
[0:22:27] SpringSong: @plaugecat late game most champ dealt 3k dmg in a second so 450 is nothing to consider
[0:22:33] QPixie: have yet to try lux with the new items
[0:22:36] amethyst_art22: @ericaborgest were there seraphine buffs or changes?
[0:22:37] fraternityy: fraternityy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 9 month streak! woot woot 25 lets goooo , how do you like the new map and the new mage items since you are a huge mage main LUL
[0:22:40] nippietassel: @BadInGood bottom left my dude
[0:22:42] plaugecat: @SpringSong lol if u say so
[0:23:01] ssoolix: Hiiii im cleaning my kitchen and came to stay entertained while doing so💕
[0:23:02] amethyst_art22: @badingood lower keft.. under the sponsors
[0:23:18] nippietassel: @BadInGood or maybe not......used to be, my bad
[0:23:18] ericaborgest: @amethyst_art22  I don't think so, maybe just the new items are better on her?
[0:23:22] Jimmysqn: hi
[0:23:22] jimbob_ywert: and it’s always the games with a good mentality in a team that can actually make comebacks. comebacks are always possible with good coordination and mentality which league doesn’t tunderstand
[0:23:41] BadInGood: ty ppl
[0:23:44] SpringSong: @plaugecat if you want to build it go ahead its not mu business comparing to void it less efective so you lose ur 1 spot for less evective item thats all
[0:23:47] amethyst_art22: @ericaborgest might be.. i haven't tried them much yet
[0:23:58] sajmonstepien: Don't you think that there is lack of mana in these new items? Maybe it's just me
[0:23:59] fraternityy: i tried nunu assassin and let me tell you oh my oh 1 w one shots anyone and also the next person to it kaypLOL
[0:24:22] QTwinkyyy: BTW is there rank inflation rn? I finished last season emerald 4 and started emerald 4 after first placement.
[0:24:22] nippietassel: it just says Mid Season Trials, but no track name
[0:24:38] Jaguar542: What buff did Lux get?
[0:24:41] mouritchou: wait i just realised u'r back to dark harvest
[0:24:47] TWanderer: AS is too OP
[0:24:48] lewhitehd69: kaypMega POSTURE CHECK EVERYONE kaypMega
[0:24:50] SpringSong: yea it not even lethalitu
[0:24:58] Kiuzu: the problem isn't really about the mage items in my opinion, more about that you can abuse it as "support" with random mage-champs and as a "normal" adc/enchanter botlane you just get so bullied you almost can't do anything
[0:25:15] Kiuzu: and then you have two guys with new ap items on the enemy team
[0:25:18] ssoolix: when are the buffs out
[0:25:21] amethyst_art22: @lewhitehd69 i will be kaying down however i want kaypCreep
[0:25:22] sofondapoon: omg teemo with the new ult cooldown item is so annoying
[0:25:24] Vencut: i thought lethalithy counters armor
[0:25:36] lewhitehd69: @amethyst_art22 no ratirlMad
[0:25:42] Dumbmuto: kaypArrive
[0:25:47] Dumbmuto: @lewhitehd69 plink
[0:25:47] plaugecat: yes armor counters leath
[0:25:48] miiguellee: Hello, what elo u r on right now? I am gold 4 in europe as well, the games are 100 or 0, very annoying
[0:26:03] Monody_7: Monody_7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:26:04] Dumbmuto: @ericaborgest kaypHello
[0:26:15] fraternityy: @Vencut they buffed it again so now 10 lethality now removes like 8 armor or something
[0:26:26] TWanderer: @Kiuzu I played Ori support last night ...  Typically I was 15/1/10
[0:26:26] amethyst_art22: @lewhitehd69 kaypTroll2
[0:26:31] lewhitehd69: @Umuto123 plink hellaow ratirlHey how was your weekend? peepoSit
[0:26:36] plaugecat: well it was not buffed jsut reverted
[0:26:45] amethyst_art22: hello @umuto123 kaypFlower
[0:26:48] lewhitehd69: !casnnon

[0:26:52] Nightbot: KayPea has missed: 1178 cannon minions Clap
[0:26:59] Zeberdie: i mean the first challenger in NA got there playing APC sera/hwei with support items and not AP items
[0:27:18] cauewer: queria aprender a falar em inglês para te entender :/
[0:27:21] SadLuvi: wish lux didnt self root when she casts skills, she'd feel so much better
[0:27:30] QTwinkyyy: as a support main spamming mages feel crazy rn! Getting the support upgrade lets you do percentage  health based poke and Morgana, Zyra and Hwei feel ridiculous.
[0:27:42] amethyst_art22: @sadluvi this is a fact
[0:27:45] lewhitehd69: yuumi soundtrack AYAYA

[0:28:24] NoPainNoDane: HELLO KAYPEAAA :)

[0:47:45] Azmod3ous: last years
[0:47:49] jimbob_ywert: what I’m finding interesting lately is how easy it is to come back in games that seems like it’s a loss. and it’s always the games where my team has GOOD mentality and scaling where we actually comeback compared to the whiners who wanna ff and go next when they’re not in the lead early on 24/7. I believe it has to do with peoples attention spans these days.
[0:47:55] Smoothcollie: I don't even remember the cinematic from last year
[0:47:57] atalaycakirer: helloo have a n,ce stream

[0:48:39] xBoomShotBaby: what do you mean, you dont have any counters kaypAyyy
[0:48:40] mistermurr: Last year's cinematic was sctually the trailer for the 2024 one kaypLOL
[0:48:48] sajmonstepien: I think new dawn is so beautiful
[0:48:51] ericaborgest: oops is this the same jinx?
[0:48:52] Azmod3ous: Warriors gave me chills when I first watched it
[0:48:53] ericaborgest: :o
[0:48:55] sajmonstepien: Even tho it's quite old

[0:50:33] sajmonstepien: like super galaxy rumble🥹 ahhh the nostalgia truly hits
[0:50:55] Azmod3ous: I do
[0:51:02] k0t10n: galaxy rumble reminds me of rocket from guardians of the galaxy
[0:51:06] k0t10n: is his name rocket?
[0:51:09] k0t10n: i forgot
[0:51:12] Azmod3ous: it makes sense bc it has less of a pool to pull from I'd assume
[0:51:13] BlindMyLee: never thought about it that way. But that makes so much sense
[0:51:14] ssoolix: whenever this happens i just cancel the queueidk why gut feeling

[3:24:57] Azmod3ous: @AmberAnjuna isnt that still less gold for whoever the carry is meant to be bc the procs on the minions only give the killer 20 gold
[3:25:13] 懂汪納督賣價博: sion
[3:25:31] AmberAnjuna: @Azmod3ous
[3:25:34] AmberAnjuna: oops
[3:25:51] Azmod3ous: lol
[3:26:26] lewhitehd69: plink
[3:26:29] ericaborgest: isn't it point and click?
[3:26:40] AmberAnjuna: @Azmod3ous the way i see it is that they both share minions from time to time, so they both get the full value for each other's stacks. And for the passive that gives less gold when you kill too much minions, it kind of adapt faster so you are not constantly in deficit
[3:26:44] AllyCaatt: Darius big angry jee

[4:10:21] aezami: hi good luck with the games
[4:10:30] ericaborgest: farm jungle
[4:10:37] ericaborgest: if there's any
[4:10:39] ericaborgest: :(
[4:10:45] Trishia_Schwartz: this briar is very toxic for their KDA
[4:10:52] dubstepdonut9: ADCute but not a lotta damage
[4:10:52] k0t10n: YAY 500
[4:10:55] Almeroo_Hedaia: Freya vs Voli, he will regret it
[4:11:01] x_Lobstromonous_x: the comeback is on
[4:11:04] Azmod3ous: As my friend Thad likes to state It's a Graycation kind of game XD
[4:11:10] alvaro_sl7: xddd
[4:11:17] nicorasenpai: kp what about a draven for adc and u get free LP Kappa
[4:11:28] dubstepdonut9: ADCan't do anything this season
[4:11:45] ericaborgest: true
[4:11:45] ballzagna1: lol
[4:11:55] gurudyne: Wow. That was some sunk cost fallacy by Briar
[4:11:59] k0t10n: nope ive been one shotting adc with my kaisa mid w all day today KEKW
[4:11:59] Trishia_Schwartz: whew briar is tilted for sure
[4:12:01] ObsceneSanity: ADC non-lethality builds are sorta troll at the moment it feels like
[4:12:03] Almeroo_Hedaia: the moment when you wish you can't see properly
[4:12:09] ballzagna1: marksman have been the weakest roll for multiple seasons now... its fucking sad
[4:12:26] navilleraZ: @ObsceneSanity for real
[4:12:56] ObsceneSanity: in lower elo its true, but its because the teams refuse to play for the bot lane
[4:12:59] ballzagna1: are any of us in masters plus? no
[4:12:59] k0t10n: kp i have question, why dont you start cull when you are adc?
[4:13:08] dubstepdonut9: bring adc back to the people!!
[4:13:09] nicorasenpai: kp this game is to get shut downs
[4:13:11] jimbob_ywert: ADCs impact the most in higher elos def
[4:13:12] Almeroo_Hedaia: it's champ issue too, jhin is so op these patches
[4:13:31] k0t10n: this kayle deserves report
[4:13:47] k0t10n: too much talk
[4:14:27] fuxs0c: which rank is this?
[4:14:27] RCStableSteven: well; such is life in the hands of riot games.
[4:14:37] alex227gk: @fuxs0c emerald
[4:14:41] Almeroo_Hedaia: the issue is that fizz was confident on being mid :(
[4:14:45] mrshibasan: Hello Kaypea the Dog of the basement is very late, is me Mr Shibaaaa
[4:14:46] k0t10n: briar is at least trying
[4:15:12] ObsceneSanity: @k0t10n shes been trying to get the team to ff
[4:15:17] mrshibasan: Herrrooo
[4:15:23] k0t10n: @k0t10n im talking about the scorei mean
[4:15:32] ObsceneSanity: ohh
[4:15:44] k0t10n: cause ofcourse she deserves a fat report
[4:15:47] Trishia_Schwartz: briars attitude is why their teammates couldn't turn a game. just tilting the rest of their team
[4:15:53] SirWutz: SirWutz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[4:15:53] Almeroo_Hedaia: being 2/9 as an assasin mid is a crime
[4:16:07] mrshibasan: And of course HERRO MISS KAYPEAA
[4:16:53] k0t10n: this game was so sad Sadge
[4:17:01] k0t10n: but kp's mental is a fortitude
[4:17:07] Azmod3ous: Good try You'll get them next time Kay!
[4:17:17] Trishia_Schwartz: famous last words lol one more game
[4:17:23] ericaborgest: gg thanks for stream kaypLove kaypLove
[4:17:27] kreumbly: I honestly think that Jinx is kind of a low tier adc this season
[4:17:30] LA6oofa: !rank
[4:17:30] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=No+Cannon+No+Cry%23pea%2CKarma+Pengu
[4:17:32] RikiHeka: RikiHeka subscribed with Prime. 
[4:17:34] Riikkuuuu: Dont forget about predicition
[4:17:35] Smoothcollie: Another oooone!!!!!!
[4:17:43] ObsceneSanity: i would honestly queue anything but mid/bottom for a bit. ADC just sucks to play right now. SUpport is uber powerful. Specific ad champs only work in bot now. all around it sucks
[4:17:48] dylanship: As much as I feel sad for the game,  but I won the prediction :'(
[4:17:49] kreumbly: I feel like items just fit champs like Cait, Ashe and Zeri or Varus better
[4:17:55] waraiai: The malphite and fizz swapped
[4:17:57] Riikkuuuu: 29k achieved
[4:18:03] Riikkuuuu: Sorry for not believing
[4:18:18] jimbob_ywert: TRY THE MID-SUPPORT THEORY
[4:18:19] RikiHeka: Every time i try for mid i get support xD
