[1:24:42] theshadowninja89: Even after nerfs
[1:24:52] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: and what about a bruiser ad build like: botrk>triforce>wits end ?
[1:27:26] AYAYA_JAM: wouldn't terminus be better than triforce?
[1:27:37] DontFeedPenguins: ^ yea, I agree on that one
[1:28:25] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: idk i havent played with terminus yet
[1:29:19] 514484: it's so annoying that he goes ghost

[1:53:28] EIWich0: my eyes
[1:53:47] EIWich0: that yasuo
[1:56:43] 514484: delete kayn please
[1:59:31] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: maybe rift instead of the new item ?
[1:59:54] kablooom: not feeling the liandrys tbh
[2:01:07] kablooom: i agree for late game
[2:01:09] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: i dont rly like the new red item
[2:01:55] PhilosoPhiddle: Have you tested Stormsurge at all? I know it would only work well with AP burst. But the item is so damn busted might be worth until nerf @ipav999
[2:02:47] 514484: yes
[2:02:48] sollerium: yes
[2:03:06] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: honestly the game i've played i was fed so a lot of the ennemies took dewarder and i couldnt have a shroom up
[2:03:09] ArtokArtok: if you have liandri stacked the maliganace proc will be bigger
[2:04:08] kablooom: mid teemo is not mid
[2:04:18] Leetmmoman: stormsurge mage

[2:06:49] 514484: no way right? he deals mostly magic dmg
[2:06:55] ArtokArtok: corki builds triforce
[2:07:04] 514484: go malignance anyway, who cares
[2:07:20] PhilosoPhiddle: I have never bough LD on corki
[2:07:23] ArtokArtok: AP corki not good right now
[2:07:42] PhilosoPhiddle: Isn't his E the only thing that does AD though
[2:08:09] ArtokArtok: @PhilosoPhiddle he plays like an ezreal
[2:08:28] nextgenmarcus: NOT EVEN CLOSE
[2:08:45] ArtokArtok: R auto w auto
[2:08:54] ArtokArtok: e auto
[2:09:02] ArtokArtok: r auto
[2:09:02] PhilosoPhiddle: I play both. I don't think they play at all alike
[2:09:30] PhilosoPhiddle: They both have some AD and AP scaling
[2:09:39] PhilosoPhiddle: if that is what you mean
[2:10:05] PhilosoPhiddle: Q max is AP, E max is AD. Far as I know
[2:10:12] OrbitalPeacock: whats the corki build now, malignance"
[2:10:12] PhilosoPhiddle: But I NEVER do E max lol
[2:10:17] ArtokArtok: @PhilosoPhiddle no i mean they are both sheen champs, only one uses R and the other Q
[2:11:04] PhilosoPhiddle: ahhh Yeah that is true. If you go Tri force + ad items, that is actually very ezreal like play
[2:12:01] PhilosoPhiddle: Would still be very interesting to see full AP with malignance, which I am sure would work fine long as you play it right.
[2:12:01] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj

[2:14:27] OrbitalPeacock: Q is 0.5, ult is 0.12, big ult is 0.24
[2:16:30] PhilosoPhiddle: AP corki main dmg is Q

[2:17:43] OrbitalPeacock: the jukes
[2:18:54] rhogadearcane: corki sucks

[2:39:31] PhilosoPhiddle: Nahh I think you would of had WAY more fun and done better just full AP
[2:39:39] PhilosoPhiddle: with Luden and Malignance
[2:39:49] PhilosoPhiddle: I have done it tons of times it works fine
[2:40:11] PhilosoPhiddle: He isn't, that must just be high tier only?
[2:40:46] TausendSonnen_: But still ap boots
[2:40:57] 514484: back to hexplate teemo EZ

[2:43:59] kablooom: I think it works good in lane
[2:44:12] kablooom: one poke to start it.
[2:44:26] Khirgil: Good luck getting it before laning phase is over.
[2:45:01] Khirgil: Why? Don't you normally build Demonic Embrace?
[2:45:22] Khirgil: Riftmaker is essentially just Demonic Embrace now, right? Just build it when you would Demonic
[2:45:30] franko420_: did you try electrocute taimo with new items?
[2:45:45] AYAYA_JAM: omnivamp isnt good?
[2:45:49] jeromefrance: @khirgil de item banned
[2:45:49] ForceurUltime: it's a fine item but there is just better options right
[2:45:58] Khirgil: @jeromefrance I'm very aware
[2:46:00] kablooom: you survive better with rift
[2:46:01] rhogadearcane: poison ticks keep you in combat to stack it
[2:46:35] kablooom: ask the 26% winrate top teemo player Kappa
[2:46:37] BottleRocketBoy: I mean, the problem with rift this season is you can't heal from minions
[2:46:56] MaskedSatan: draft pick?
[2:47:04] Khirgil: @ipav999 Ignoring the omnivamp, it's just Demonic Embrace, isn't it?
[2:47:18] rhogadearcane: omnivamp is garbage anyways
[2:47:40] Pitju99: this is for melee champions that have way more dmg than teemo so they also heal more
[2:47:49] Pitju99: rift sucks on taimo rn
[2:47:54] Khirgil: Well, I guess it doesn't have DE's burn
[2:48:02] BottleRocketBoy: Unless you're stacking health it does nothing
[2:48:04] kablooom: it helps fight off teemos passive global taunt.
[2:48:34] MaskedSatan: ROA?
[2:48:36] LycianTopos: Hi ipav! Does life steal work with the magic damage part of toxic shot?
[2:48:37] kablooom: we are not trying to tank.. just survive a gank or anti-poke.
[2:48:59] Pitju99: just build a giants belt and an actual item lol
[2:49:34] 514484: hexplate meta EZ

[3:16:20] ParkingSeal: fun times aplenty here - grab some popcorn & a beverage
[3:16:50] ParkingSeal: (you can have some of mine ofc - but I'm afraid it's rather a long reach)
[3:17:03] Pitju99: it shouldnt refresh more often prolly cause its not a cooldown but a duration
[3:17:15] NotASkiller: @pitju99 good question. can this be tested in practice tool?
[3:17:38] Pitju99: yes
[3:17:49] Pitju99: shouldnt work but just in case
[3:17:59] CharlieBGood: xINT zhao
[3:18:03] NotASkiller: @pitju99 why not?
[3:18:03] 514484: aatrox still being in the game is another arguement against paying this game EZ
[3:18:34] Pitju99: @notaskiller because the effect lasts 3 seconds, it's not a cooldown, it just refreshes when you deal damage again
[3:19:01] Pitju99: but in case it does work somehow it could proc 3 times on shroom
[3:19:12] pikapika_666_: 2500$$$
[3:19:28] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: morgana is such a boring and useless champion, even noobs can dodge her Q and then you get those that press E on cd but not when it matters PepeLaugh
[3:19:42] NotASkiller: @pitju99 do u know if the rune works on Tiamat?
[3:20:11] Pitju99: it works cause tiamat has an active, it also works on stormsurge
[3:20:49] Pitju99: and many people are using it with the critting healing bruiser item
[3:21:21] Pitju99: if it's worded as cooldown it prly works
[3:22:13] CharlieBGood: draven removing nash's 1 health bar per hit LUL
[3:23:17] pikapika_666_: moneys
[3:23:30] ursowo: if varus wasn't such a coward
[3:23:38] ursowo: he might be able to get both taliyah and aatrox
[3:24:16] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: varus is playing full AD it seems, only going for Q snipes
[3:24:26] pikapika_666_: yeah, and the morg also seemed to panic a lot.
[3:25:39] jeromefrance: Teemo can face draven, last chance to comeback, blind power
[3:26:46] Gr4ve_Digg3r: he is just don’t get damage
[3:27:38] Sarnyroth: F
[3:27:45] pikapika_666_: at least it ends faster :)

[3:33:32] PhilosoPhiddle: Sporebloom is from Path of Exile lol
[3:33:43] ZipperCipi: i love you and i love myself
[3:34:08] PhilosoPhiddle: Just don't love yourself tooo much, that is how you go blind
[3:34:21] MuffinVsMuffin: I dunno I got rolled by a temp the other day.
[3:34:28] MuffinVsMuffin: teemo
[3:34:35] Sarnyroth: Stormsurge common on Kenny rn isn't it?
[3:34:45] ursowo: Does malignance gets a good proc on Kennen?
[3:34:51] Kalloool: ur items are low

[3:36:46] Pitju99: rocketbelt is an actual dmg item
[3:36:54] pikapika_666_: give the same items as the teemo
[3:36:55] 514484: remove banshee or zhonya, nobody will buy both every game
[3:37:35] pikapika_666_: lol
[3:37:40] 514484: wow, Teemo suck!!! PogBones

[3:43:24] la_kemono_lupus: you consume the w with the q
[3:43:30] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: counterstrike damage is higher when you dodge
[3:43:46] la_kemono_lupus: the w is either a reset auto or more q damage
[3:43:56] yeaokbuddy2000: is the hexplate thing not good on jax?
[3:44:26] caciuslove: @Honourable_Sir_Tucancap really?
[3:44:40] AYAYA_JAM: yes
[3:44:44] yeaokbuddy2000: yes it is
[3:45:07] pachio23: is jax a shit champ
[3:45:12] yeaokbuddy2000: and it also reduces aoe dmg by some %
[3:45:18] Pitju99: but jax can keep doing this forever
[3:45:19] ursowo: It's low on burst, but he can do sustainaable damage and he can lasts forever in a teamfight
[3:45:34] Kalloool: ap jax is fun
[3:46:00] pikapika_666_: maybe crit for jax?
[3:46:05] MuffinVsMuffin: relogging doesnt work unless you close the entire progam its dumbv
[3:47:15] Pitju99: the new item
[3:47:19] MuffinVsMuffin: if you have xbox live you can keep removing it and putting it on another account and unlocking all champs pretty good for alts lol
[3:47:20] Pitju99: sundered sky
[3:47:31] Pitju99: yes
[3:47:38] Pitju99: eclipse
[3:47:52] ParkingSeal: Trinity Force has to auto in-between like Lichbane
[3:48:01] ParkingSeal: (for proper damage i mean)
[3:49:18] jubaaim: illaoi and sundrer doesnt proc on her W
[3:49:24] Pitju99: it can actually be higher with seryldas
[3:49:39] jubaaim: some items still broken on melee champs
[3:50:05] ParkingSeal: slow on the shroom-hit
[3:50:06] Aldurfus: blind bot KEKW
[3:50:32] ParkingSeal: blind
[3:51:17] 514484: teemo has no initiative, yes
[3:51:37] pikapika_666_: except waiting invisible :)
[3:51:45] ParkingSeal: ..next to a shroom or two
[3:51:49] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: they can force plays, teemo needs to prepare
[3:53:04] EG_Kel: lay teemo ipavPog build doesnt counter every other champ in the game ipavNLT test incredibly specific builds for 3 days ipavHmm write down results in text document ipavNotes dont save document ipavWut repeat until retirement ipavBoomer
[3:53:04] jeromefrance: Fo sure any cdr item do less dmg.
[3:54:03] 514484: teemo  must bee seen as a vision specialist
[3:54:23] tomentumv2: !rank
[3:54:27] Pitju99: to be completely fair though, auto range can substitute for no mobility and no tankiness similarly. also cc-ing the enemy or not doesnt matter too much as long as they die
[3:54:34] jeromefrance: @eg_kel Teemo supp counter draven pretty good. Cdr Armor build, prepare your best taunt and laught
[3:54:41] tomentumv2: !ugg
[3:55:24] tomentumv2: yo chat
[3:55:28] EG_Kel: CATW ipavKEK
[3:55:30] tomentumv2: can i hav Ipav opgg?
[3:55:31] Aldurfus: @EG_Kel catKISS
[3:55:39] EG_Kel: @Aldurfus SoCute
[3:55:42] jeromefrance: @514484 yes, teemo is king for vision and setup objectives.
[3:55:49] stephens777: i never espected teemo support this season to be honest
[3:56:11] 514484: 10 years in and he finally understands teemo PogBones Kappa
[3:56:13] ParkingSeal: that's what he's become maybe
[3:56:24] ParkingSeal: he wasn't that originally
[3:56:31] maiert69: why does teemo support makes more sense this season?
[3:56:36] jeromefrance: @stephens777 i got orgasms playing him with malignance before the hotfix.
[3:56:45] CharlieBGood: But at the end, we all love Teemo anyway, we accept him for who he is. Our lovely, beautiful little disaster.
[3:56:50] spidiofficial: spidioffical subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[3:57:25] sicko_maude: Are we playing ranked today Mr.Ipav?
[3:57:50] jeromefrance: @maiert69 malignance gives tons of shrooms, easier to work on low economy.
[3:58:11] maiert69: kay ty
[3:58:50] Pitju99: as long as they die, they won't always die, but yeah
[3:58:51] 514484: the goal of teemo is give vision, waste enemy team while running away, and pressuring side lanes
[3:58:59] 514484: enemy time*
[3:59:01] jeromefrance: @maiert69 more bushes to trap also, roaming easier a bit imo
[3:59:12] sicko_maude: LUL
[3:59:24] sicko_maude: Asked before you Q up
[3:59:26] sicko_maude: mb
[3:59:45] 514484: *ramping up 45 that we never reached
[4:00:09] sicko_maude: But each shroom hit way harer
[4:00:14] sicko_maude: harder*
[4:00:25] 514484: it's ok now we have the hexplate tech that allows us to do no damage but spam more
[4:00:54] xLeSeigneurBalekx: Ipav have you tried tankmo from manco ?
[4:01:19] Pitju99: well yeah but malignance does a lot more dmg than hourglass
[4:01:38] xLeSeigneurBalekx: Hearsteel> bersk>rift>lyandri and then tank items ?
[4:01:57] AYAYA_JAM: what if you go nashor>bork>terminus>rageblade>wits end?
[4:03:40] PhilosoPhiddle: I have never played League of Legends before. Is it a MMO ?
[4:03:44] sicko_maude: Each shroom does double dmg less shroom but more impactfull
[4:03:54] xLeSeigneurBalekx: ye it's the same, but now you have Morrelo giving CDR/CryptBloom
[4:04:26] Sarnyroth: This new Baron pit music is weird
[4:04:38] sicko_maude: Malignance passive dmg is nuts i feel
[4:04:44] sicko_maude: im not a  fan of the items
[4:05:10] sicko_maude: but it does more dmg they get slowed in the area of effect of malignance
[4:05:26] Sarnyroth: It sure would be nice if Riot brought back item stat trackers so we could actually see how much dmg Malignance did
[4:05:27] xLeSeigneurBalekx: mali give the same bonus cdr as lyandri mythic when full item
[4:05:34] xLeSeigneurBalekx: well for shroom
[4:05:42] sicko_maude: in teamfights
[4:06:13] Sarnyroth: Would First Strike be any good for trap damage or no good? @ipav999
[4:06:36] Bonyeti: other lanes going wild
[4:07:20] Sarnyroth: 5 whole seconds is like.. one Morgana Q
[4:08:23] Pitju99: @sarnyroth teemo has terrible interactions with first strike
[4:08:39] Sarnyroth: Just curious, didn't know if he had tested it.
[4:08:43] Pitju99: the poison quickly procs it giving you almost nothing
[4:09:58] n0n0ghost: hola señor ipav
[4:10:47] RipYourRng: @ipav999 have you been watching zwagmo at all?

[4:17:26] jeromefrance: Look like kled is learning
[4:17:35] Aldurfus: @xavisonline 50/50 match
[4:17:59] w1nterghost: why did they nerf teemo
[4:17:59] xavisonline: hmm
[4:18:13] Wulfos: @Aldurfus not really 50/50 teemo counters kled alot
[4:19:03] jeromefrance: @w1nterghost they said it's nerf to champ using malignance ''on hit tic''

[4:22:16] BigDaNx: report
[4:22:16] jeromefrance: I'am happy with the nerf, it means less teemo ban, and LB statikk is down.
[4:22:36] krozarotk1: U lost a teamfight why typing this
[4:22:37] Sarnyroth: Kled played mad lmao
[4:23:38] xNostalgiax: are the flame stacks 1 ability haste each?
[4:23:47] Sarnyroth: More like .3
[4:23:50] Aldurfus: @xNostalgiax 3 = 1
[4:25:05] 514484: disostor
[4:25:30] jeromefrance: You can also exchange 3 flame stack at the shop for a beer. But only if Gragas october fest is in the game
[4:25:38] yungmoneyhashregister: how tf did kled get 6 kills?
[4:25:47] Aldurfus: @jeromefrance the more you know

[4:37:21] Wildpoki: league gave me bg3 tadpoles
[4:37:40] PhilosoPhiddle: @TheZedFight Ap is better now yes. But the problem is all other ways to play Teemo are likely much worse. And AP works best at mid/lower elo
[4:39:15] TheZedFight: I see I see
[4:39:42] Selfon300: what do this orang orbs do what he is collecting?
[4:40:10] Aldurfus: @Selfon300 give ability haste

[4:44:27] truxiel: Do you ever play rankeds?

[4:50:24] ursowo: what if it is a Zed jungle and a Kayn top
[4:50:30] ursowo: or a Nautilus top
[4:53:55] leequangdai: so its about team's skill, not player's skill?
[4:53:57] ursowo: not even the thing of your team being bad, more like if they're dumb/don't want to win
[4:54:48] ursowo: a bad player can be carreid, but a dumb player would never, he will sink you to the bottom because he has a bad attitude, bad ego and he is going to make you drown
