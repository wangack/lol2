[1:43:45] xth0m1: 1 more ad leblanc game pls
[1:44:18] DecodeXander: she still playable ad?
[1:44:24] adzipxd: Nice hat bro
[1:44:30] zerotonero: What?
[1:44:40] imanailment: it's a crit on the W out
[1:44:52] coainthehouse2: is leblank playable on statik and the rest of items ap?  lich bane, stormsurge....
[1:44:57] zerotonero: Insane
[1:46:02] sleepizkey: damn t1 is not on yet.. guess im watching Bob
[1:46:13] WeAreOutOfPasta: you tell 'em Bobby
[1:46:17] imanailment: CRIT
[1:46:21] cypc: Bring back Q mute! ;D
[1:46:34] Vertebraille: Crit
[1:46:59] zerotonero: Crit build next game?
[1:47:01] 777raw777: im gonna try it i guess
[1:47:05] imanailment: certain things in league increase crit chance, I've notice dashing makes me crit more often (or just biased)
[1:47:10] cheshirebelow: So even after nerf this is still playable back to banning lol
[1:47:13] colemyj: Any more yone?
[1:47:32] PowPowNoeks: @imanailment no. crit chance isn’t actually random and not critting in a while increases your crit chance
[1:48:36] badvaloplayer: Roasting a dude who outgrinded and beat him for no reason. Cringe
[1:49:07] PepeLaugh_with_me: naaah, keep her on the dl like a hot side chick
[1:49:34] NHSloth: i dont like ad leblanc just because you dont os as fast as ap lb
[1:49:43] imanailment: @PowPowNoeks meaning i can just use it as an execute?
[1:49:45] cheshirebelow: Isn't the simplest thing to do to gut lb is just make the recharge not apply on her dashes???
[1:49:55] NHSloth: but i agree that ad lb is better to win gae
[1:49:58] NHSloth: game*
[1:50:06] NHSloth: Yes
[1:50:13] ilov3oov: old Q back
[1:50:14] zerotonero: But atleast you get the kill
[1:50:37] 777raw777: acp
[1:50:46] PyramusHD: even if they stand still a 20 kill lb doesnt one shot
[1:50:58] perfectsweeties: if you make lb's dash not charge then thats so weird
[1:50:58] pretzel_ikz: anyone diamond+ is on autopilot or asleep if they're getting 1 shot
[1:51:00] NHSloth: Well im low elo i know im bad a the game xD
[1:51:03] perfectsweeties: like it's bad game design to just be like
[1:51:13] perfectsweeties: this is the only champ that is omitted from this mechanic
[1:51:17] zerotonero: You can not miss your auto
[1:51:24] minojiko_9: it's crazy how quick they hotfixed it
[1:51:29] ilov3oov: that means i am safe on AP LB on low elo , no1 dodges xD
[1:51:46] thanzinnn_: hey bob
[1:51:55] NHSloth: no no ofence its ok im learning from you
[1:52:15] thanzinnn_: !build
[1:52:16] Nightbot: statikk shiv.
[1:52:26] NHSloth: im gratefull and sorry for my english im french lol
[1:52:40] thanzinnn_: so what is the build after the nerf?
[1:52:50] 777raw777: it looks good lol
[1:53:17] 777raw777: unless you hit a chain on kata with ap build you never kill her
[1:53:30] genocy: bob theyre just dumb it's ok
[1:53:53] Adrino10x: Adrino10x subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 33 month streak! cant wait to grind lb this season
[1:53:54] Nate_mayo: give me your whole combo bobby Kreygasm
[1:54:50] PowPowNoeks: @imanailment what? no cause you can’t predict when you will or won’t crit. the game just has a “pity” system that increases your chances of critting if you haven’t crit a bunch of times in a row
[1:55:14] PowPowNoeks: not like you’ll always crit after 3 non crits
[1:55:23] PowPowNoeks: that would be busted
[1:55:28] zerotonero: How many times can they nerf us until they just give up and rework her kit?
[1:55:41] thanzinnn_: @zerotonero true
[1:57:13] thanzinnn_: @bobqinxd do you plan on doin like a guide for lb this season?
[1:57:33] 777raw777: whats the build
[1:57:41] yoishim: riot refuses to give leblanc meaningful W buffs and until they do she will feel like shit AP
[1:57:52] thanzinnn_: like a ULTIMATE LB GUIDE SEASON 14 type shit
[1:58:26] minojiko_9: what you change on her to make ap lb better?
[1:58:54] thanzinnn_: @minojiko_9 W
[1:59:55] Hatersbby: if only we got the q silence back...
[2:00:14] yoishim: Q silence needs to come back
[2:00:24] NHSloth: the one time she was rework i didnt like it
[2:00:29] yoishim: leblanc can't compete with s8+ champions
[2:00:30] zerotonero: Unlucky
[2:00:43] 777raw777: when does the new event go live
[2:00:53] cypc: @yoishim +

[2:06:39] thanzinnn_: lmao
[2:06:46] leamfor: I miss when Statikk used to hit like 11 targets :(
[2:07:47] leamfor: nope
[2:07:47] 777raw777: shiv into what
[2:07:48] Nightbot: yes
[2:07:48] PoroPatty: its 6 perma now
[2:07:50] PoroPatty: they nerfed it
[2:07:55] thanzinnn_: bob you think there is a viable build for like bruiser/tank lb?
[2:08:47] PoroPatty: i swear the only reason shes broken is that item and the waveclear it gives her...shed not be able to do things with waves if not for that item
[2:08:57] apolo2332: tank lb is the best lb
[2:08:59] yoishim: yes
[2:09:09] yoishim: AD leblanc only came back when shiv came back
[2:09:09] Nightbot: bob is contractually obligated to run ads by Team Liquid and Twitch or he will get spanked. sorry guys :/

[2:19:58] kael98: This is the best build?

[2:38:33] pretzel_ikz: HUH
[2:38:45] higortekker: you outscale an infinite scale champ?
[2:38:47] kamuiv9: how do you outscale veigar as lb though
[2:38:49] notaaronjoshua: @mddkyrone makes me want to get a cat LMAO
[2:38:50] evilshado: lb outscales veig? what is happening to the world
[2:38:58] mddkyrone: @notaaronjoshua HUH

[2:39:59] Zer0brain_: I don't get why play AD lb ap is so much better
[2:40:06] 777raw777: how you win vs akshan or fed adc its unplayble
[2:40:11] 777raw777: at least ap had a chance to 1tap adc
[2:40:18] leamfor: @Zer0brain_ Cause it isn't
[2:40:24] 777raw777: but in loserq its alwyas enemy adc fed

[2:42:34] 777raw777: it fries my brain that i dont know the damages as well as i knew the ap ones tho
[2:42:41] aFullMetalMUTT: Yep just be like AP is better but I like to play with a handicap so I go AD lol
[2:43:02] majesticstoner: i mean i think ap is only better in niche situations @Zer0brain_ .. but I think ad is viable in more scenarios. If you are good at lb that is
[2:43:51] Zer0brain_: @majesticstoner I hear you but if you land Ur combos u legit one shot squishies where as AD u w in auto and run I don't get it 😂
[2:43:51] buzza_x: @bobqinxd if both AD an AP LB were both balanced to the same strength, which one do u enjoy playing more?
[2:43:57] 777raw777: @777raw777 yes but still if you know your dps dmg you can assess if you can make a kill happen for example
[2:44:58] 777raw777: isnt like akashan matchup doomed to never outscale him ?
[2:45:02] mddkyrone: NOPERS
[2:45:04] Zer0brain_: When I play AP leblanc during teamfights I can W in then Q R E and it's either insane DMG or a kill
[2:45:21] Zer0brain_: And the Q R W combo is disgusting
[2:45:36] 777raw777: wave  clear feels good tho
[2:46:18] majesticstoner: @Zer0brain_ i think that's where the argument lies... You dont have to hit abilities and can just aa them down. So when your opponents are much better at dodging (the higher elo you go), ad finds more comfort
[2:46:28] Avdg8: !build
[2:46:28] Nightbot: statikk shiv.
[2:46:53] Avdg8: ad still better than ap??
[2:46:53] Nightbot: bob is contractually obligated to run ads by Team Liquid and Twitch or he will get spanked. sorry guys :/
[2:46:59] medluxi: u going ad?
[2:47:11] Zer0brain_: Yeah maybe but for example just now if he was ap that veigar would have died
[2:47:31] majesticstoner: yeah but if he was ap he wouldnt have gotten the second kill
[2:47:52] alaara98: do it
[2:47:53] leamfor: no :)

[2:56:08] jauntytune: so is Hwei just unplayable as a midlaner?
[2:56:29] Caliburen: @jauntytune feels like it he just isnt good at rotations
[2:56:35] Caliburen: or solo laning
[2:56:42] Caliburen: past laning phase
[2:56:49] NHSloth: everyone watching you would say lb is broken an them once they play see that its not that simple to play it
[2:56:57] mddkyrone: o7
[2:57:24] SylokPnDm: @NHGreed won 10/11 games with lb

[2:58:24] MrHiLighter: its now the mains time
[2:58:35] 777raw777: its so unplayble tho
[2:58:56] kamuiv9: i think the most annoying lb build was when sunderer worked
[2:59:03] a7med7oss475: bro got deleted
[2:59:17] i_ptg: that's true, I have ~20 games on lb, tried ad build and got stomped on 3 games in a row

[3:24:18] OrangeGorilla: 4/4/4
[3:24:23] cloudy_irl: You are less relient on split push now and you can poke the nemy harder now wiht ad

[3:25:33] choopii: reason why i hate fizz lb matchup when im the lb
[3:25:46] cloudy_irl: Think s14 ad lb is better but is less newbie friendly becouse you dont have that much cdr now and you arent tanky anymore
[3:26:23] 777raw777: its the squishiest champ in the game its really bad
[3:27:12] cloudy_irl: yap
