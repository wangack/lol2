[1:15:57] nituahc67: taco do you think they will change crit if lethality is stronger on jhin right now
[1:16:11] Mcsevem77: when it not laning phase anymore, mostly when u get tower @sllashy_
[1:16:38] Nephomuse: @sllashy_ rule of thumb is when a bot tower is destroyed

[1:18:31] veileen_: @1KiKo So whats the build?
[1:18:31] OddIsHe_: crit makes you rely on team doing good and playing around you which isnt good most of the tiem
[1:18:53] OddIsHe_: lethality is more self dependent
[1:19:15] CictorGabriel: that would actually have worked lmao

[1:25:30] OddIsHe_: youmuus is too good
[1:25:40] flab1os: do you go gym ?

[1:30:32] SaltedIIIBlueberries: exil says hwei bot is also good ad a apc
[1:30:44] NomadNoah: I feel like Hwei support also synergizes terribly with Jhin, they kinda struggle to combo will in my experience
[1:30:51] katxps: dang
[1:30:52] NomadNoah: *combo well
[1:30:57] OddIsHe_: @Somethin__ at the end choose whatever build you want, they both have different playstyles
[1:31:02] SaltedIIIBlueberries: played with hwei support yesterday he so useless he cant poke and cc

[1:33:14] final_zangetsu: @OddIsHe_ he already got hot fixed? another buff already?
[1:33:14] OddIsHe_: riot wants ez to be meta apparently
[1:33:19] TopKeks_senpai123: @OddIsHe_ ez is strong lol wtf
[1:33:25] TopKeks_senpai123: he doesn't need to be buffed
[1:33:29] kikkybio: ikeepitSHY

[1:34:15] OddIsHe_: yeah i saw spideraxe on x tweeting abt ez buffs
[1:34:32] final_zangetsu: feel like riot has certain champs that they always want to be relevant and will patch if they are weak for like a day (kaisa ezreal, yasuo, yone)
[1:35:09] Silvah: FrogO
[1:35:17] OddIsHe_: yeah bc they print money
[1:35:38] falchion_07: is jhin only playable in Lethality in season 14 ?
[1:35:39] kladelordkun: only 4 bans? bad sign there

[1:36:00] SaltedIIIBlueberries: ew MF
[1:36:13] hungvjp: I build trinity force for jhin :v
[1:36:23] hamsaz: @ikeepittaco what is your favorite food?
[1:36:30] bustolin: does jhin even need crit since his 4th shot always crits?
[1:36:38] Louist12: buy it then
[1:36:39] Somethin__: riot is suggesting trinity for jhin tho xD
[1:36:53] Krychek26: who's the strongest adc's at the moment this early in the season?
[1:36:54] OddIsHe_: @hungvjp might as well slap a void staff on top of that build for good measure
[1:37:01] Sneeekers: How do you know when to build dominik or Serylda please ?
[1:37:03] Silvah: @final_zangetsu kaisa and ezreal dont actually get touched that much but they're just extreme item abusers
[1:37:04] TheChosenAngel: I played the Last 4 Games Crit and it went good
[1:37:09] leshires: i just played my very first game this season, i love how kaisa can almost oneshot u with W and 1 item
[1:37:09] falchion_07: is lethality a good choice only when enemy is squishy or generally is the best choice
[1:37:11] don_schab: Lethality + infinity edge?
[1:37:22] Mikeler: did lethality get a buff ?
[1:37:25] nituahc67: more crit on jhin feels better on the kiting cuz u get the speed on crit
[1:37:30] 1samsnow1: hello guys hello taco hope your doing good
[1:37:32] hamsaz: nah lethality is insane damage right now on jhin
[1:37:42] hamsaz: you basically one shot everyone with 3 items
[1:37:50] hungvjp: Crit = move speed and high dame on jhin so u should build like 80% crit on jhin
[1:37:53] SaltedIIIBlueberries: rare pick
[1:38:02] TheChosenAngel: Ha th lat Game Twitch Support, it was rly good xD
[1:38:03] 1samsnow1: learn communication from tacco himself
[1:38:04] SaltedIIIBlueberries: tristana

[1:38:19] Wind_Blade: @khangnile kai'sa is mid
[1:38:23] OddIsHe_: @IKeepItTaco is lucian strong bc jhin is?
[1:38:26] Wind_Blade: like B+ tier
[1:38:35] HUB_Muszla: isnt like ez after W buffs good too ? What are ur thoughts
[1:38:35] TheChosenAngel: Mf isnt the strongest anymore?
[1:38:40] chipichipichapachapagr: I would add mf there
[1:38:42] ospylac11: ZED IS LL STYLISH
[1:38:44] nituahc67: until they like make crit better then mostly lethality is what you should be going
[1:38:52] Silvah: lucian is like always strong lol
[1:38:57] OddIsHe_: i love picking lucian into jhin
[1:39:05] hamsaz: they‚Äôll nerf the lethality items I think no?

[1:39:17] chipichipichapachapagr: Maybe elo wise mf isn't right but in low-mid tiers she's a beast
[1:39:24] DrFeely: feels like Lucian has never been weak
[1:39:35] 1samsnow1: meanwhile kaisa is the weakest
[1:39:38] Silvah: lucian is a popular pro play champ
[1:39:42] skinyboyy: its dom pogg
