[0:27:04] bobileeswagger: no mic?
[0:27:07] NothHellNoaKnight: hydra rush also alows proxyinh
[0:27:11] Amaresu_: but shojin is made for riven so ..

[2:55:20] EpicBaller72: yeah

[3:04:08] 1Adrianaries1: @bweadconnoisseur when i heard about the race i knew the top 3 would just be junglers
[3:04:17] 1Adrianaries1: always goes that way.
[3:04:48] rain_of_ashes: more like junglers can decide whether to win or ff at 15, so faster games too
[3:04:54] 1Adrianaries1: now what really changes is if the junglers are carry players or utility based on meta
[3:05:05] 1Adrianaries1: so i knew nunu/ivern would domintae xD

[3:08:26] nausikha_lotus: hello viper hello everyone polypWave
[3:08:36] cahallo: VietSteak I thought it was more of like "who gets higher in x ammount of time" instead "1st to challenger" cuz I am illiterate
[3:08:38] dayquil333: @Viper what do i build against sion?
[3:08:48] cahallo: instead of*
[3:08:55] YEEtora: yone still has F right?

[3:09:26] clg_dragon: clg_dragon watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! idk what this is
[3:09:36] hylianpie: yone is the most useless top laner, because hes not really a top laner
[3:10:03] VietSteak: @hylianpie wdym he was strong as fuck last season in top lane lmao
[3:10:08] rain_of_ashes: @hylianpie  sorry to disappoint you bro, but he's a solid top laner

[3:10:24] R1v3nIsADancer: its funny how toplane doesnt matter in low elo. just went 2/1/0 bc my opponent abandoned lane after 1 kill and then there was nothing actually happening
[3:10:25] slajders1: Tbh yone is better on top than mid
[3:10:27] hylianpie: @ggizimyfriend nah PepeLaugh
[3:10:39] T1Tesko: DunOffViktor looking strong
[3:10:47] hylianpie: every single champ counters him top lane its not even funny, build tank and then yone can't do anything because all he does is auto
[3:11:26] Shammerham: Every single champ LMAO
[3:11:30] hylianpie: 48% past seasons too Weirdge will probably not work anymore after item optimizations too PepeLaugh
[3:11:30] VietSteak: @hylianpie who the hell picks yone into a tank lmao

[3:25:13] micoalahierba: profane is better
[3:25:15] Ozube: 12% ls 10 ad vs 18 lethality
[3:25:15] T1Tesko: @nxtrl i didnt really try other builds so i cant compare, but its a solid 8/10 at least
[3:25:18] viper_fanboi: prob rav cause of life steal
[3:25:20] hylianpie: 12% is pretty big
[3:25:21] kylerarc: rav > profane
[3:25:21] nxtrl: it doesnt proc on abiliteis anymore either @Viper
[3:25:27] Kalistaforevereu: Will porofessor or any similar app be bannable with upcoming new anti cheat?
[3:25:31] nxtrl: @T1Tesko am i a solid 8/10

[3:26:17] drakonken: Aatrox the most difficult match for me
[3:26:20] drakonken: now let's see how to do it
[3:26:25] kylerarc: i think alot of champs will end back where they started with buildls similar to last season lmao
[3:26:26] NothHellNoaKnight: i think you need domination secondary runes for propane
[3:26:44] T1Tesko: mirror matchup lowkey
[3:26:46] Epytt: @drakonken trade without getting hit with big Q
