[6:06:39] 2WipeOut: u in que?
[6:06:44] nothudo: @HarvestMoonica you got this! im studying to be a rn myself!
[6:06:52] AWOAT: if you get enough lines, the game crashes
[6:06:53] Finchit: max score or kill screened?
[6:06:53] fatpep: nes tetris
[6:06:59] Respect_Dat1: this kid is the first one to get kill screen
[6:07:01] Piejamas: If you get to a certain level, the game crashes
[6:07:03] battosai_gg: he got so far the game crashes
[6:07:04] view_bot_prime: he beat tetris by getting so far that the game bricked itself
[6:07:04] Grommit90: 40 minutes lol
[6:07:05] lookoutitscaleb: @HarvestMoonica fast for a day 2 days before the exam to increase Neurogenesis in the Hippocampus <3
[6:07:05] cupo_k: this is the super nintendo version of tetris, if you get an integer overflow the game crashes
[6:07:07] Feirbear: He kill screened it
[6:07:08] battosai_gg: never been done before
[6:07:12] vlobt: This kid got roasted on Australian TV
[6:07:13] toast042: there is no game over for tetris, so they basically decided game over is when the number gets so high the game crashes
[6:07:16] Finchit: its called a kill screen
[6:07:18] Lpebony: game was unbeatable, that kid did. Big math behind it, it's complicated as fuck. Also, I saw him mashing, the apm is unreal
[6:07:24] toast042: and he's the first person to get it
[6:07:25] runningshoes: @Pobelter they play till the game crashes
[6:07:26] ApacheTomcat: previously only tas had done it
[6:07:31] hi_im_meo: they figured out a new way of using the controller to move the pieces faster
[6:07:32] cupo_k: nobody bothered
[6:07:33] botje__: yes he made the game crash setting a new wr
[6:07:35] Feirbear: It's hard lol
[6:07:37] yophukashi: a new roller tech was conceived
[6:07:38] HarvestMoonica: @nothudo good vibes!!!!
[6:07:38] xohu__: the color of the blocks hard to see
[6:07:38] hi_im_meo: they flip the controller over and drum their fingers on it
[6:07:39] MultilateralDev: skill diff
[6:07:39] Finchit: xddShrug
[6:07:41] ch3m15try: because its old programming and it crashes constantly
[6:07:42] ApacheTomcat: its hard
[6:07:46] BlackStripesOnOrangeFur: he's really good
[6:07:46] 0neblockshort: probably no one cared tbh
[6:07:47] sadgemonke256: WHAT
[6:07:47] Respect_Dat1: he's using a trick on the controller to make it go faster
[6:07:48] AWOAT: rolling wasnt invented til fairly recently
[6:07:52] Kev141: he apperantly played this game with his dad before he unfortunately passed last year, then he beat the game got on the news and the news anchor made fun of him
[6:07:53] botje__: they invented a new method to move the finger on the remote
[6:07:55] battosai_gg: you have to do like rolling with the buttons
[6:07:56] Kev141: @Pobelter
[6:07:56] botje__: it's incredibile
[6:07:56] ch3m15try: im pretty sure hes speeding it
[6:07:56] nothudo: @HarvestMoonica <3 NODDERS
[6:07:57] aspkosas: SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[6:07:59] Spoontrix: they see me rollin
[6:07:59] oudyn316: hes the first human to ever do it. they have had AI do it before but never a human
[6:08:00] NiarAli: he is using like this finger roll trick with buttons
[6:08:00] Pon_Solo: is this tetris
[6:08:00] Grommit90: They have a new technique with tapping controller
[6:08:01] graffitieyes: someone probably did it before but just thought their game broke
[6:08:02] HaxHai: cus the controller heavily limits how quick you can move the blocks left/right
[6:08:03] view_bot_prime: they didn't think it was physically possible to do a few years ago apparently
[6:08:06] jtmorris827: until recently no one thought you could get past like lvl 29, he got to lvl 157
[6:08:06] Grommit90: It's faster than keyboard
[6:08:07] HarvestMoonica: @dethrey jossblPuppy jossblPuppy jossblPuppy
[6:08:08] Kev141: read my message for lore pob
[6:08:09] 0neblockshort: proof pob you need to do it to prove it
[6:08:10] fatpep: theres many techs to use NES controllers u have no idea about LUL
[6:08:11] Kev141: on this video
[6:08:12] cbezxd: Look @ the techniques they use
[6:08:18] runningshoes: @Pobelter the colors fuck up and make invisble blocks, and it goes so fast you cant hold to move blocks
[6:08:25] From_Zero: You have to do this for a long time to get that level, and the speed technique to make em turn faster wasn't even known 10years ago
[6:08:28] scooterCx: HUH
[6:08:29] Lpebony: monkaS
[6:08:30] KnightmareN54: The reason they do it is because the finger doesnt move that presses the button but they smack the back of the controller which is faster than physically pressing the button as fast as you can
[6:08:31] KnightArn: nice
[6:08:31] ch3m15try: dies of cooming
[6:08:33] hi_im_meo: took 30 years to do that
