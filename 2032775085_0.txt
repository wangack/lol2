[0:01:14] mckinseykm: Secret stream WOWERS
[0:01:26] mckinseykm: What time is it there?
[0:01:38] LiNkzr: 1am
[0:01:41] mckinseykm: Sorry sorry I'll keep it quiet
[0:01:51] pocketmotch: SHUSHERS
[0:06:14] LtJared: LtJared subscribed with Prime. 
[0:09:35] Frendie: hiHelloHi:)
[0:09:48] SpottySlawek: bla
[0:12:43] StreamElements: LiNkzr is now live! Streaming League of Legends: secret league stream *shh*
[0:13:23] SpottySlawek: no game audio?
[0:13:45] mckinseykm: Having played league maybe twice this game always looks like chaos to me
[0:13:57] mckinseykm: It's just quiet I think
[0:14:30] SpottySlawek: I can hear something now yea
[0:14:36] LtJared: now its good
[0:17:37] SpottySlawek: infinity, rapid
[0:19:44] GuySyr: How are you liking League now that the Mythic items are no longer?
[0:20:49] GuySyr: It's a slight difference. but only those who know what WERE mythic items vs what wasn't will be able to take advantage.
[0:21:22] GuySyr: Because mythic items locked you out of obtaining other items that were mythic.
[0:21:38] larbyy: Chatting
[0:21:40] GuySyr: So you couldn't do trinity force + Iceborne on ezreal
[0:21:54] LtJared: zed just exists
[0:22:30] GuySyr: which was a thing that was relevant when both items sported mana for what was known as "blue-ezreal"
[0:22:42] GuySyr: Now they're just taking mana off of items left and right...
[0:23:28] GuySyr: The jungle has changed a bit too, not by a ton... but enough to make a difference.
[0:24:40] GuySyr: Imagine if they brought back old ZZ'Rot portal
[0:25:41] SpottySlawek: >:3
[0:25:44] GuySyr: krakenslayer for a while was a mythic item, until a few months before they took away mythics...
[0:26:28] ADC_Vr: bla
[0:26:54] GuySyr: kinda curious what kind of nonsense that infinity edge + navori can get up to
[0:27:21] ADC_Vr: oh solo farming ?
[0:27:28] ADC_Vr: *solo farming
[0:27:30] GuySyr: Crit items actually got a massive buff with the removal of mythics...
[0:27:37] ADC_Vr: OH LMAO IT'S AN EMOTE
[0:28:12] GuySyr: You could save it for 5th item
[0:28:30] ADC_Vr: i never pick GA when I play Ashe but you can never go wrong with Bansee Veill
[0:28:46] GuySyr: I mean, you've only died 2 times as I'm typing this out
[0:29:07] MassiivinenLoL: Shieldbow maybe ?
[0:29:11] GuySyr: and if your team is gonna peel like that for you
[0:29:20] SpottySlawek: can't go wrong with firecannon
[0:29:30] SpottySlawek: more range is more safe
[0:29:38] larbyy: MONKA
[0:29:41] ADC_Vr: actually I don't know if Banshee is still good or not lmao
[0:29:56] GuySyr: how tanky is their team?
[0:30:25] MassiivinenLoL: @ADC_Vr It's ap item, no ?
[0:30:28] GuySyr: maybe blood thrister?
[0:30:33] GuySyr: *thirster
[0:30:46] ADC_Vr: @MassiivinenLoL wait I forgot. But is it the one that has magic resist ?
[0:31:06] MassiivinenLoL: Yes ap, mr and spellshield
[0:31:09] ADC_Vr: WAIT WHAT
[0:31:13] SpottySlawek: huh
[0:31:15] ADC_Vr: I DON'T REMEMEBR IT GIVES YOU AP ??????
[0:31:27] MassiivinenLoL: it has been ap item for quite sometime :D
[0:31:33] Farkuly: @ADC_Vr i think it used to be mr?
[0:31:39] GuySyr: Banshees USED to provide HP + Mana + magic resist before the itirations that exist now.
[0:31:49] ADC_Vr: i left league for a long time for the good benefit of my mental health OMEGALUL
[0:32:20] MassiivinenLoL: Banshee has been ap item since like season 7 or something
[0:32:25] ADC_Vr: Nooo what. I think I remember take that because it use to give you MR and 1 bubble hit
[0:32:44] MassiivinenLoL: It used to be hp, mr and spellshield.
[0:32:54] ADC_Vr: @MassiivinenLoL ahhhh season 7...
[0:32:57] GuySyr: Like, no one ever plays Ryze because mana builds are nerfed to the ground, and they changed his abilities to the point of making every other champion far more viable with only 2-3 buttons
[0:33:10] ADC_Vr: well I'm not wrong entirely then LULW
[0:33:46] GuySyr: I forgot about the spellshield part for a moment. It was the only item in the game at the time to grant one
[0:34:30] larbyy: EZ
[0:34:33] ADC_Vr: gg
[0:35:13] GuySyr: wait...
[0:35:19] GuySyr: 1-3 so far?!
[0:35:22] pheasant_sc2: can you play adc bard
[0:35:36] pheasant_sc2: ok
[0:35:47] pheasant_sc2: i just wanted to learn from the best
[0:35:51] ADC_Vr: huh that sucks when I think about it. So what item does ADC need to have MR then ?
[0:36:11] GuySyr: Merc blade?
[0:36:17] MassiivinenLoL: Maw or qss usually. Some adc's can go wits end
[0:36:21] GuySyr: for the item cleanse
[0:36:22] WeightsnQueues: degen stream nice
[0:36:55] ADC_Vr: oh I'm assuming lot of items got rework then
[0:37:06] GuySyr: alot of items got changed and removed
[0:37:14] GuySyr: jungle even got a rework
[0:37:19] GuySyr: "rework"
[0:37:35] GuySyr: probably not "bad"
[0:37:41] GuySyr: just poorly represented
[0:38:02] pheasant_sc2: YEP
[0:38:17] GuySyr: could try?
[0:39:45] MassiivinenLoL: Try kraken -> terminus -> stormsurge -> situational ap items. Felt okay.
[0:40:36] MassiivinenLoL: When I tried it i went shadowflame 4th but can be something else i suppose
[0:41:47] MassiivinenLoL: For sure someone will figure it out soon. I just saw this kraken, terminus, stormsurge posted on twitter :D not sure if this is the op build
