[0:25:11] I_am_Lasagna: @FartDiddler Feels bad dude, once you play more and learn more about the game in time they won't be as opposed to it
[0:25:22] FartDiddler: i dont think they like me
[0:25:26] nyellobello: At what point do you back? Because my biggest trouble is backing and suddenly team get into a fight i dont get to participate in
[0:25:31] coklov69: FirstTimeChatter
[0:25:35] couchpotatoeater: Believe bro. Think of the youtube views

[0:25:55] 19yruj: @FartDiddler surely they'll play norms with you? like norms literally dont matter if they wont at least play that with you then you need new firends
[0:25:55] ChadingoYitten: Gorp
[0:25:57] Shcleepy: GORP
[0:25:58] nyellobello: @fartdiddler usually support but i play top and mid lately

[0:26:20] CHOHSAN: Sylas'd.
[0:26:41] FartDiddler: @nyellobello if ppl are grouping and theres no objective up dont back if objectives are up and laning phase is over i dont recomend backing. backing early mid game when laning ends and u run out of wards is good
[0:26:41] 99mediocre: this sylais 1v9
[0:26:44] pixeluwu: getting hope'd
[0:26:48] gorudo_prime: will you play sion pekin?

[0:27:31] AllUpinYoFace: !siondiff
[0:27:35] I_am_Lasagna: @FartDiddler Remember that you can only have 3 wards up at once so backing all the time for more wards isn't always the call
[0:27:35] pixeluwu: Robert VS ewpert
[0:27:38] dinastyxy: Shyvana was good here
[0:27:43] Kalqulus: Mosh

[1:03:56] troutyo: @byrn_22 from what I've seen, at any point in the game, hubris total bonus usually increases you AD by about 10%. I know how the item works, just an observation on how useful that number is
[1:03:58] AntonyTLK1: :0
[1:03:58] Byrn_22: 103 ad item for 3000 gold is pretty good
[1:04:00] BlueSNS: @sleepyhead54 now if you add it up it's 24 which if u do some funny number stuff you get 4

[5:00:36] KurzedMetal: The idea of a mage that have to go melee is kinda bad
[5:00:43] Verseau_: why did you buy luden, this item is so trash

[5:02:36] CHOHSAN: Denial is that thing.
[5:02:37] onlym1lfs: yea not ther 1/5 top xdd
[5:02:39] AntonyTLK1: OMEGALUL
[5:02:42] wiz8iz: Renekton loses to like everything rn
[5:02:45] opticalbattle: Lost skill matchup = counter :0
[5:02:45] ImRikai: Always an excuse
[5:02:45] AntonyTLK1: OMEGALOOOOL ezreal W
[5:03:00] MMA031: Renekton is just a stun bot now
[5:03:24] amujinkoyy: bro is playing pyke and doesn't flank
[5:03:30] wr2th: arab
[5:03:31] KittenWithThumbs: arab
[5:03:34] KingPatissier: Pekin, any tip you could give me for ranked anxiety?
[5:03:40] pholtos: he got rekton
[5:03:43] chachik89: 0 mental
[5:03:48] 3019517: H
[5:03:50] CHOHSAN: Not noly is he going to jkill himself, he's probably going to blame everyone else for it. MiniK
[5:03:51] MMA031: Chatting arab
[5:03:56] CHOHSAN: I'm that Renekton after I lose lane.
[5:04:13] AntonyTLK1: @mma031 all random all bot
[5:04:15] amujinkoyy: it's the luck of the draw!
[5:04:15] KittenWithThumbs: i no no wanna :(
[5:04:24] 19yruj: @heinzbitte serylda's still does below 50% other than that I don't think there is or at least not one thats good on ez, only traditional adc's with lower wr than ez rn are kog, zeri, and sivir which makes sense since kog and zeri are usually kept weak and sivir is outdated
[5:04:30] CHOHSAN: I'd probably be like 3 divisions higher if I tried harder.
[5:04:32] superduperpooperscoope: quantum just saved a game so hard
[5:04:36] bread328: ggs
[5:04:36] CHOHSAN: But if I'm not having fun... NOPERS
[5:04:53] SilliestBear: I can't blame him tbh aatrox is so awful to play against
[5:04:57] Dwinigans: HypePat

[5:05:00] Nightbot: Use !queue for the name of the queue game.
[5:05:07] Wolflordxyz: Chatting I'd probably be like 3 divisions higher if I tried harder.
[5:05:11] CHOHSAN: AGREED!
[5:05:13] AntonyTLK1: I know what to say : kok
[5:05:14] twistedwinnings: It's my first time tuning in, how long does it usually take the queue to pop usually?
[5:05:18] yimmbob: can't wait for ad TF to go through
[5:05:20] AntonyTLK1: peepoLeave
[5:05:23] magic_GR74: true
[5:05:24] heinzbitte: @19yruj I didn't realize that, I need to take a better look at the new items
[5:05:25] CHOHSAN: Exactly.
[5:05:28] SilliestBear: YEP
[5:05:29] Miguel_Noether: remember when you used to love maining ap vex mid.... :"(
[5:05:32] 19yruj: @heinzbitte sheen going from 700 to 1000 also hurt him a lot
[5:05:35] xReptarSC: @PekinWoof That's why I am going to swap to Smite 2
[5:05:37] fighting_fafnir: dota 2 gives the remaining team bonuses if someone leaves lol
[5:05:41] CHOHSAN: Me too.
[5:05:47] opticalbattle: catDespair
[5:05:50] heinzbitte: They should just replace you with ai
[5:05:51] CHOHSAN: Instead they ahve to deal with me being frustrated until we lose.
[5:05:55] m2o0: But u can win even if he lane was bad no ?
[5:05:57] shintoaliengod: pekinDespair
[5:05:57] CHOHSAN: So unfortunate for everyone involved.
[5:05:59] wiz8iz: TRUE
[5:06:01] amujinkoyy: what about competitive?
[5:06:01] m2o0: the*
[5:06:03] bigchickensandwich: that's quickplay
[5:06:04] yimmbob: that doesn't sound very fun
[5:06:04] TravestyGaming: Have you been seeing much of the everyone buys the support item strat?
[5:06:09] wr2th: AhriSway
[5:06:09] superduperpooperscoope: each team picks a champion loser ffs
[5:06:10] onlym1lfs: champ select
[5:06:13] MMA031: wish you could leave and someone else queues and pilot your champ instead YEP
[5:06:13] m2o0: Hmmm
[5:06:14] JaoPing: yes if i lose my lane in the first 5 minutes i should be able to make the game end
[5:06:14] opticalbattle: CatGun take it back pekin
[5:06:16] heinzbitte: Team mate tilts? They get kicked and replaced by a bit
[5:06:17] m2o0: Good point

[5:06:44] poopy68419: @Miguel_Noether smite is the superior moba
[5:06:48] superduperpooperscoope: people can leave and then another top laner ports in
[5:06:50] CHOHSAN: My ideal world also doesn't involve autofill.
[5:06:55] 3019517: gh
[5:07:00] twistedwinnings: Smite is kinda like league, but also not? All the characters are gods from different mythologies
[5:07:09] 3019517: H
[5:07:11] crozy88: whos your worst favorite mid laner
[5:07:21] 19yruj: @crozy88 hwei :(
[5:07:22] therockcena99: I think it’s an Asol game thoughts
[5:07:24] CHOHSAN: They're both MOBAs.

[5:07:55] 19yruj: @CHOHSAN he said galio is too boring
[5:08:03] Miguel_Noether: imagine if there were 6 people in game and when anybody wants to ff the sixth person replaces him
[5:08:12] NickTheFitz: how about Viktor?
[5:08:19] twistedwinnings: I've been playing Galio support and it's p fun

[5:08:40] mddkyrone: meow
[5:08:43] opticalbattle: Great he isn't playing league.
[5:08:46] 19yruj: Imagine how much better league would be if it was 3v3 and jungle and support didn't exist god that would be nice
[5:09:29] SirRoto: HUH 󠀀
