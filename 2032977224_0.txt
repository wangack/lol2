[4:05:32] saml415: need the upper body strength for sports
[4:05:49] Dancin_Hansen: for sure. dumb bell press helps develop muscles that stabilize the lift. bar bell doesn't need as stable movements
[4:05:53] saml415: but a strong core = strong upper body strength
[4:06:07] majistimus2000: Then biceps and dumbbell curls are the most useful used in real life
