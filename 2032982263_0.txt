[0:10:11] Wolfmanmoore: Fancy
[0:10:16] del1nquency: is the LPL casting all OK now? I remember there were issues
[0:11:17] ReapersArk: Why do you think riot doesnt think LPL could increase in viewership similarly to the LCK?
[0:11:30] FuumaX: G2 KC
[0:12:01] najafan: Still a V5 fan. <3
[0:12:56] najafan: (I'll also forever be upset that S5 CJE didn't go to worlds. RIP.)

[0:15:17] haunterxdd: Whats your favorite LPL team @MonteCristo ?
[0:15:44] unknown87644: why the nocturne ban is it op?
[0:16:14] boked_seeker: have you seen the games yet or is this blind ?
[0:16:17] RakiTeach: Was Tarzan picked up by anyone in meantime?
[0:16:26] archie7497: Did you hire one of those government approved nannies. I still can't believe it is a real thing.
[0:16:46] FrozenLavaReflector: Noctirn also gkt expsrimental hexplatr... a perfevt item for him
[0:17:38] Giiino: kraft dinner for supper every day, the single dad way
[0:17:41] haroony123: i still cant believe riot nerfs ad lb then adds the perfect fleet item for ad lb, whyyy
[0:17:58] unknown87644: is it far from where u are?
[0:18:08] archie7497: Why does this while thing give of lowkey eugenics vibes
[0:18:13] zacharypaulk: is that post natal spa stuff reasonable pricing? i imagine like anything there are ranges you could spend
[0:18:15] najafan: Honestly I think the entire axiomata lore angle is really cool, since it sort of provides a contrast to normal views of Latin American culture, being a more mathematically focused magic.
[0:18:43] Fortune49: not bad at all
[0:19:46] najafan: Little AP heavy for malaphite, no?

[0:20:07] archie7497: Depending on which team you support this game is a tragedy.
[0:20:10] haroony123: you think any of the lck teams would run the 4 support item tech, looks a lil busted you can be so down in lane but even gold
[0:20:13] triggerzugz: im sure it's been asked. but I'm just getting back into watching pro games. wtf is going on with TSM?
[0:20:51] Fortune49: OMEGALUL
[0:21:30] triggerzugz: they're like the cowboys of league
[0:21:40] Fortune49: ya
[0:21:50] gorwings: delays and overlay issues and other production issues  have been horrible the first 2 days of LEC
[0:22:08] archie7497: @paroto7 I know that grabbz was on contract with bds last year. Idk about this year but he hasn't announced being part of any team
[0:22:13] d_kowalski: Monte, you sure you want to do this? This weekend has been awful thus far
[0:22:39] looknonumbers: just tons of delays
[0:22:46] looknonumbers: matches have been sweet
[0:22:47] Cryosight: wait, did you say parth went to razer?
[0:22:47] gorwings: graphics broken. delays for every reason. remakes
[0:22:51] Edwho: Adc's not abusing the support item, pretty sad
[0:22:51] MissingMatter: Well, he can skip the delays.
[0:22:56] unknown87644: the level of play has been pretty bad
[0:23:00] d_kowalski: And no sign that the overall level has grown
[0:23:07] d_kowalski: *risen
[0:23:12] archie7497: Lec week 1 delays are guaranteed
[0:23:14] PaulyGee: no interesting picks though. just some xhin a lot of kalista and rest is like last season
[0:23:25] boked_seeker: so many new players also
[0:23:29] boked_seeker: to LEC level
[0:23:38] AndrasMan01: Is monte into bdsm? Why is he watching this?
[0:23:47] Edwho: LUL
[0:23:50] PaulyGee: the played a lot of inhouses on the new patch for awhile now
[0:23:54] Manjiji: First time seeing the new map
[0:24:12] MissingMatter: We get to skip the delays and get straight to questioning Riot's decisions.
[0:24:27] archie7497: Funny thing is that the lec patch is different from the soloq patch. Lec is on 14.1 and soloq is on 14.1b
[0:24:40] haroony123: all i want is a team to full send it on something they think is broken, idc if the level of play is bad i just want something spicy
[0:24:46] boked_seeker: treatz tweet about removal of stopwatch was poignant

[0:24:57] xChip102: xChip102 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 89 months! thoughts on the new items?
[0:25:11] MissingMatter: Oh, they got rid of stopwatch? I think it was a mistake in the first place.
[0:25:25] PaulyGee: everyone just waiting for lpl/lck to come up with the new OP stuff. i want my M5/Gambit back Sadge
[0:25:31] Usingu: which team jersey will the kid be wearing?
[0:25:37] Edwho: Congratz
[0:25:39] haroony123: i think tldr less haste more dmg
[0:25:40] xChip102: oh thats right! congrats monte on the new child
[0:25:51] MissingMatter: I don't know much about it but iirc I heard mage items are really strong and a couple of adc items.
[0:25:54] d_kowalski: This guy acting like having a kid is anything but a walk in the park
[0:26:46] GenericAnimeName: are you gonna start powerspike next week? or at a later date once more leagues are running
[0:26:51] Edwho: Soloq games are a bloodbath
[0:26:55] najafan: Bring back laneswaps!
[0:27:03] Edwho: 40/50 deaths per game sometimes
[0:27:06] gorwings: i feel like the LEC has the best overlay for stats, but i really wish they had the overal gold difference on itlike the LCS does
[0:27:42] Edwho: Welcome to europe
[0:27:54] boked_seeker: crowd went feral today
[0:27:57] TastyAMG: Yeah i heard a lot of people complaining about it today
[0:28:09] d_kowalski: Oh yeah the fans have been annoying. Spanish vs French the whole time
[0:28:13] haroony123: but onhit adcs need to use the terminus jaksho combo more, something like 50mr/amr + 5%
[0:28:58] gorwings: if you're using epic pen, it's not coming through
[0:29:00] Cactusfive007: No pen on stream
[0:29:02] Cipherflare: just watch and listen to costream 4Head
[0:29:03] lifeline910: no pen
[0:29:04] Hi_ImPhantomere: monte, if JDG kept their roster from last year do you think they can golden road this year?
[0:29:06] Grizzleyfoot: we cant see ur aeeows
[0:29:08] whitecrayonlol: Can't see mouse
[0:29:12] triggerzugz: I see nothing lol

[0:30:07] Goreng: @toothless0108 Still better than LEC Production
[0:30:52] haroony123: lpl buff then jkjk
[0:30:57] Fortune49: you see the cowboys game
[0:30:59] MissingMatter: They probably want there to be more dives because it's potentially more explosive with turning it around and stuff.
[0:31:34] sota_cat: kc never ever lands once vi nekko combo in teamfight
[0:31:36] RomanticCreampie: prefer bot being more gankable tbh
[0:31:44] Goreng: wdyt about objective having wider choke point?
[0:32:06] haroony123: noc gonna be the new zeri for like half the year then?
[0:32:29] TastyAMG: Can't wait to see LPL teams fight to the death over grubs
[0:32:55] haroony123: full send 5v5 for first 3 grubs gonna be so funny
[0:33:04] GPAlexander: The grubs really feel like a win harder mechanic.  Win top - get grubs - win harder.
[0:33:39] najafan: Looks like G2 actually decided to go full AD even after seeing the malph rather than pivoting.
[0:33:56] najafan: Or kennen is mixed, at least.
[0:34:10] haroony123: i feel like if you draft prio bot and full send for grubs it feels kinda gg in solo q maybe in pro too
[0:34:47] RomanticCreampie: ad lb FeelsWeirdMan
[0:34:54] naocorrijo: i feel like teams like t1 geng blg are gonna get every grub since their solo lanes are insane

[0:35:26] Edwho: Just passionate mate
[0:35:38] GPAlexander: It's like a wwe crowd
[0:35:39] ephidal: we wanna be like real sport, monte
[0:35:50] Shunkan: it doesn‚Äôt really work when there‚Äôs so few of them
[0:35:56] Goreng: @GPAlexander WWE is a theater tho
[0:36:05] d_kowalski: Imagine all the KC ultras that were whining on Twitter would be in that arena. Would be unwatchable with sound
[0:36:05] najafan: Think of it like hockey fans.
[0:36:12] MissingMatter: Passionate about quality gameplay? Why are you watching Western LoL, then?
[0:36:21] unknown87644: wait so are certain sections reserved for the fans of specific teams
[0:36:42] ephidal: and lcs, dont forget lcs
[0:36:44] MatuGG: tomorrow will be louder with the mdk vs kc
[0:36:48] d_kowalski: SK has been a pleasant surprise thus far
[0:36:57] Just_Russ: LEC has been really sloppy so far, even from top teams. Hope it improves over the season
[0:37:03] haroony123: annnnd games over
[0:37:10] sota_cat: when can we see the liverpool smokes on lec stage as well,the passion
[0:37:21] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo which region on paper looks more competitive, LCK or LPL this year?
[0:37:25] MissingMatter: With as spiky as damage is, I think Viego's going to get to go off a lot.
[0:37:45] GPAlexander: Did you watch Rule the Rift?
[0:37:48] Goreng: @Hi_ImPhantomere Why are you asking this to one of the biggest LCK fan  anyway, the answer is LPL
[0:38:33] haroony123: im hearing kdf is winning worlds
[0:38:40] Hi_ImPhantomere: the addition of Cuzz makes them even more dangerous as well
[0:38:41] Goreng: cvMax finally gonna win again PogChamp
[0:38:47] d_kowalski: This will be the one year where KT will win a title
[0:38:57] d_kowalski: Cementing the Beryl goat status
[0:39:01] archie7497: You mean kdf right
[0:39:03] sota_cat: events result in 70% depends on meta
[0:39:14] lifeline910: when does lck start?
[0:39:26] naocorrijo: kdf has dudu and cuzz which should have been kt top jungle duo zzz
[0:39:30] Cipherflare: KT is the best cake üéÇ this year. weird timeline LUL
[0:39:35] unknown87644: any hope for sandbox enjoyers
[0:39:35] Goreng: @d_kowalski to be fair beryl have more world final apperance than Mata and Gorilla combined KEKHeim

[0:40:59] Hi_ImPhantomere: monte, do u at least have hope that Perect will turn out to be good>
[0:41:04] toothless0108: but deft though Yumm

[0:41:41] Duje275: yike going to deep
[0:41:41] JustBeQuiet: what do u think about t1 roster running it back?
[0:41:41] TastyAMG: This was a mega int from G2

[0:41:47] TheTraderKing: Is this a gold league game KEKW
[0:42:01] najafan: How good is Kiin at playing mid lane again?
[0:42:07] haroony123: nah geng is the lck coinflip, greatest team or completely lost
[0:42:24] Duje275: also misses r
[0:42:31] Duje275: i think
[0:42:38] Goreng: @haroony123 LCK coinflip is HLE tho
[0:42:59] najafan: @haroony123 I think dplus also has that potential.
[0:43:00] naocorrijo: hle has the geng core, they'll be top 3 for sure
[0:43:07] d_kowalski: Oh please no
[0:43:08] archie7497: @montecristo look at what Bo unintentionally did. He flashed in on miky but ended up tanking the aphelios ult. Prevented a lot of damage
[0:43:13] haroony123: @goreng i feel like they will either be ok or good in lck, then bad inter
[0:43:21] unknown87644: so does the winner of MSI go to worlds guaranteed?
[0:43:29] TastyAMG: Anyone but T1 and im happy iwdYEP
[0:43:39] naocorrijo: same
[0:43:46] aBitTooHircine: is china in an esports winter too or was jdg just specifically too expensive

[0:44:14] sota_cat: @aBitTooHircine t
[0:44:36] Shadowless10: I mean, if you earn a 4th seat slot for your region, you should be garenteed a slot into the tourney. That makes sense to me.
[0:44:41] najafan: Bring back zzrot!
[0:44:46] najafan: Bring back banner!
[0:44:56] MissingMatter: This rallysport herald thing seems a bit much.

[0:45:23] najafan: (Also bring back AP bruiser fizz, I miss him so much.)
[0:45:34] TastyAMG: The only way they could have possibly run it back is if they won worlds and got the skin money
[0:45:48] Fissiccisst: JDG should've simple just never faced any eastern teams during worlds
[0:45:49] TastyAMG: too bad worlds has such a shit format FeelsBadMan
[0:45:49] haroony123: @najafan nah that made me want to die when i played against it
[0:45:51] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo thoughts on Faker choosing Ori instead of Ahri for his worlds skin?
[0:45:53] archie7497: Well faker can make back 16 mil I guess
[0:46:01] najafan: @haroony123 That's the point, yes.
[0:46:08] cableguy23: Hey Monte been wanting to ask this, would a global low-ping server be possible?  Would it be incredibly expensive?  Would it help the west?
[0:46:13] kingkevin619: @MonteCristo  why did they make t1 vs geng the first match of the lck
[0:46:32] martziens: why not, thats hype
[0:46:37] Cipherflare: Nip Rookie is a razor cake this year?
[0:46:39] unknown87644: is Cabo a Jayce player
[0:46:43] d_kowalski: No
[0:46:44] haroony123: @najafan well you got the next best thing, ad lb and the new upcoming support item bloodsong on adcs
[0:46:55] sota_cat: @archie7497 zeus accepted self deduction half salary for faker 16m
[0:46:59] Saahf: wasnt jayce banned in this one?
[0:47:24] triggerzugz: do you have a video that breaks down money for these teams? it feels like there are more people watching than is represented in money to me.
[0:47:26] kingkevin619: i think jayce was banned\
[0:47:27] archie7497: Yes g2 banned jayce bb4
[0:47:44] haroony123: bro you do NOT wanna see eu jayce before lck figures out the builds
[0:48:00] najafan: @haroony123 Nah, the point is constant %hp damage, 2 dashes and an invuln.
[0:48:18] najafan: They removed the first.
[0:48:18] gorwings: any thoughts on duffman back to G2?
[0:48:43] PaulyGee: Caps with the casual 300g shutdown while only being up 400 gold and 0/0/0
[0:48:54] TastyAMG: the Zeus 0/7 jayce game is legendary. that man ran it down so hard and still found a way to be useful
[0:48:57] Goreng: @MonteCristo thought on objectives chokepoint being wider?
[0:48:58] cableguy23: t1 vs new gen g in like a little over 48 hours
[0:49:25] archie7497: Considering how op hubris is on live patch and if lck plays on 14.1b then we will definitely see jayce
[0:49:31] Goreng: Cabo baited his entire team here
[0:49:50] archie7497: And there it is. Cabo ruining the whole game
[0:49:51] haroony123: @najafan i hope phreak doesnt hear your ideas :)
[0:49:56] Goreng: They didnt even pushed bottom wave
[0:50:17] TastyAMG: Cabo solo lost the game here and people still found a way to blame upset lsrKEK

[0:50:39] Goreng: @TastyAMG Cabo & saken tbh, they did nothing the entire game
[0:50:42] najafan: @haroony123 iirc phreak hated it.
[0:51:03] TastyAMG: @Goreng agreed, i can't wait for Saken to get a promotion back to ERLs
[0:51:09] haroony123: @najafan thank god
[0:51:11] sota_cat: xdd

[0:52:05] Fissiccisst: fumbling the L
[0:52:10] Fissiccisst: or rather fumbling the W
[0:52:15] DemonioStrada: bangers only? i have been lied to!  I will be back when its LPL, this is budget low quality "banger"
[0:52:16] Cipherflare: You can soundboard question ping LUL
[0:52:46] Fissiccisst: @Cipherflare good idea actually lol
[0:52:55] najafan: @haroony123 pretty sure the only reason it was tolerated was because it was a competitive counter for maokai, and when maokai was nerfed they went ahead and changed how his W worked in the assassin update.
[0:52:55] PaulyGee: viego ulted after Vi Q
[0:53:20] PaulyGee: yeah kinda weird interaction
[0:53:41] Goreng: dylan be like "oh they gave us free baron now"
[0:54:26] Goreng: watch cabo threw the game again
[0:54:38] haroony123: @najafan fair, it was just annoying to play against when i used to spam top tanks
[0:54:39] TastyAMG: i dont understand why you get upset and bo and pair them with this mid and support free my mans peepoSad
[0:54:53] TastyAMG: AD Leblanc needs to die forever its so unhealthy
[0:55:06] najafan: You can probably get someone to mock up a question mark / exclamation mark ping animation for the overlay.
[0:55:25] Fortune49: disgusting

[0:55:32] najafan: Shouldn't be that hard, as long as the pen is also working.
[0:55:38] archie7497: Cabo ruining another play. Just flash malph ult while the lb is stunned.
[0:56:05] sota_cat: the world's worst region banger
[0:56:10] haroony123: i think its kinda dumb that a mostly energized build works on anything but jhin
[0:56:16] tohighformicro: I enjoy seeing those fast on The lb autos/weaving
[0:56:33] Sabunn: cabo misplays every situation this game
[0:56:58] najafan: Understandable ;)
[0:57:10] haroony123: kill lb, win game, easy
[0:57:27] Itsifi: wasting another year of bo rlewisSpewin
[0:58:02] haroony123: @itsifi yh bro is never gonna make worlds ithink
[0:58:11] Fortune49: wtf are those things
[0:58:18] sota_cat: kst
[0:58:22] MissingMatter: @Fortune49 Everybody's Bard now, I think.
[0:58:25] TastyAMG: Upset and Bo played well this game their team just wasn't good enough
[0:58:40] Fortune49: @MissingMatter thanks riot
[0:58:42] tohighformicro: I felt bo had a good game
[0:58:43] archie7497: A lot of good Mr items added this season
[0:59:09] MissingMatter: Honestly, I don't really know much about it but that's what it looks like.
[0:59:19] TastyAMG: Aphelios was also a passenger this game
[0:59:20] haroony123: only kinda weird mr item is the one that gives a 1k mr shield
[0:59:28] sota_cat: they hould r4 leesin couter lb,
[0:59:57] najafan: Way back in S3, S4, like almost all MR items were kinda weird, they've done pretty decent since then imo.
[1:00:07] Fissiccisst: Fissiccisst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! I offer my sacrifice to the korean hype train
[1:00:36] MissingMatter: That was good by Bo, yeah

[1:01:11] d_kowalski: Bo has been a bright spot, but I don't know how far they can go with their LFL players
[1:01:25] MoldyCalzone: KEKW
[1:01:31] tohighformicro: Lol it almost seems like upset and bo are showboating while they lose
[1:01:31] Itsifi: TSM PogChamp
[1:01:34] shahzaad: Targamas has been really underwhelming imo
[1:01:36] MissingMatter: Yeah, if they don't get the baron they just lose
[1:01:38] najafan: Almost dignitased it.
[1:01:55] TastyAMG: @d_kowalski Not far enough for the quality Bo and Upset demand. the sooner they are gone the better
[1:02:05] haroony123: tbr kc has got until like end of spring before i lose faith
[1:02:16] tohighformicro: Yea that is g2 they know their 1-3-1
[1:03:00] MissingMatter: I didn't know Kansas City even had an LEC team
[1:03:11] tohighformicro: Crazy how NRG are better than both these teams , sorta sarcasm
[1:03:26] MoldyCalzone: LUL
[1:03:45] najafan: I think their lacrosse team is alright
[1:03:59] haroony123: count it 3, THREE energized items on lb here, totally normal
[1:04:10] MissingMatter: OnKillFireDragon!
[1:04:14] Duje275: classic riot tech
[1:04:16] TastyAMG: pls rito nerf AD leblanc into the ground peepoSad
[1:05:07] TastyAMG: This is the moment people were trying to use as proof that upset lost them the game
[1:05:08] haroony123: if this game went longer im betting my left nut he builds rfc too
[1:05:10] TastyAMG: LuL
[1:05:12] MoldyCalzone: The solo lanes for KC just don't got it
[1:05:15] archie7497: Look at where the malphite with ult is standing. Wtf is Cabo doing this game
[1:05:56] Itsifi: send them back to lfl
[1:05:56] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[1:06:05] Grumahr: to be fair KC had to play FNC abd G2 first 2 games was expected that they lose
[1:06:07] d_kowalski: Will anyone in LCK adopt top Garen?
[1:06:08] tohighformicro: Was dope to see upset sorta 1v1 Caps at The end
[1:06:11] Edwho: MAD
[1:06:13] PenguinSpeak: FNC
[1:06:16] MissingMatter: I've heard tanks are pretty bad this season, but I don't know how that translates to pro play.
[1:06:19] fx_fanslowika: was th game already on?
[1:06:22] gorwings: mad-th was weird and unexpected
[1:06:26] haroony123: i wanna see sk maybe
[1:06:28] TastyAMG: @d_kowalski probably not because its bad if you are playing against people with hands
[1:06:30] sota_cat: @d_kowalski bo can shotcall well pathing early game but he can never read the win condition,he really needs a veteran strong voice can flame him on the court n take over the main shotcall @25min
[1:06:31] brodrian: MAD vs SK was great
[1:06:33] TheEngllshDevil: mad v th
[1:06:34] tohighformicro: Chadam tech' to alpha for LCK
[1:06:43] archie7497: Sk mad was the cleanest out of the remaining games
[1:06:51] archie7497: Among the back and forth
[1:06:55] boked_seeker: SK mad for sure
[1:06:57] boked_seeker: imo
[1:07:00] Shadowless10: Have we done demacia cup yet?
[1:07:07] Edwho: 5 spaniards vs the world
[1:07:08] MissingMatter: They had to allow it because it's Martin Luther King's initials.
[1:07:08] TheAzureFire: do you think "Koi Lions" would be a better name?
[1:07:09] TastyAMG: SK games have been clean
[1:07:11] brodrian: Still should have gone with MLK
[1:07:15] TheEngllshDevil: Martin Luther King v The Heretics
[1:07:18] najafan: Just imagine a fish with a mane.
[1:07:26] haroony123: nah whats worse is they changed the tag from MAD to MDK, its so ugly
[1:07:34] tohighformicro: Based @theengllshdevil
[1:07:40] gorwings: yea i really wish they kept the mad tag
[1:07:41] archie7497: This game is a snoozefest after level 3. No joke you might want to 2x this game
[1:07:46] najafan: @haroony123 Angry Dragon Knights.
[1:08:00] TastyAMG: its crazy that LeBlanc isn't banned 123 every game
[1:08:01] brodrian: @archie7497 facts
[1:08:32] TastyAMG: This champ is thanos
[1:08:48] tohighformicro: Yea if you cant play stat shiv lb its holding you back
[1:09:12] TastyAMG: anyone can play ad leblanc that's part of the problem
[1:09:38] sota_cat: here again better be leesin renekton
[1:09:40] tohighformicro: Its a huge problem but I love to see it
[1:09:43] haroony123: i want the person who concieved of ad lb to feel my pain
[1:09:47] d_kowalski: That's all 10 of them
[1:09:49] TastyAMG: They're all like this
[1:09:50] MissingMatter: Well, you only gave them EU games to pick from
[1:09:51] najafan: That's just an EU game
[1:10:19] haroony123: yh lec is now just football, wait til the chants evolve
[1:10:22] archie7497: This was such a horrible draft from th. Vi into xin and gragas into gwen. What a waste of counter pick
[1:10:24] Grumahr: watch BDS games no noise there xD
[1:10:38] TastyAMG: @haroony123 at least football chants are funny
[1:10:54] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo what about the TSM chants?

[1:10:57] TastyAMG: esports chants are just cringe
[1:11:01] catast999: if u wanted to argue heretics was full of washed up players u would show this game
[1:11:02] fx_fanslowika: but the problem is they are in spanish
[1:11:02] RomanticCreampie: does she take it up the ass
[1:11:05] fx_fanslowika: or french
[1:11:15] haroony123: rge fans gonna start doing the "our team is shit" chants in spring
[1:11:18] Voltiate: the UK chants towards opposing keepers are the best
[1:11:34] Edwho: Allez allez allez still better than "let's go defence"
[1:11:43] tohighformicro: Kek its lb
[1:11:43] MissingMatter: Just start singsonging the laner's name every time they miss a cannon.
[1:11:50] Narghem_XIII: In Spain there was a meme song about Cristiano Ronaldo that went something like... "Cristiano is MIA". The spanish crowd was chanting that about the french
[1:11:51] RomanticCreampie: john-lewis his name is a shop
[1:12:21] Cipherflare: which country have the best chants?
[1:12:29] tohighformicro: Its so painful not being able to pro view
[1:12:30] TastyAMG: @Cipherflare the UK
[1:12:35] d_kowalski: "We loose every game, we loose every game, you're nothing special, we loose every game" should be adopted by Vitality fans
[1:12:42] Narghem_XIII: @Cipherflare Argentina BY FAR
[1:12:44] TastyAMG: maybe the Irish
[1:12:46] Bestiality_Is_Just_A_Word: God Nami is so hot
[1:12:59] haroony123: @d_kowalski trueeee
[1:13:03] TheEngllshDevil: "youre just a shit G2" would be perfect for TH but I imagine you'd get kicked REAL quick
[1:14:08] najafan: "Lizzie's in a box" if any of the opposing players are br*tish.
[1:14:29] haroony123: "your a shit g2, your a shit g2, we're beating you with kids, your a shit g2"
[1:14:34] TheTraderKing: ELOYA!
[1:14:38] TastyAMG: why is there a D in MDK
[1:14:49] Grumahr: monte you dont really seem to enjoy these games xD
[1:15:24] najafan: Perkz has never been the same since NA, D:
[1:15:24] ENV187: @TastyAMG MAD KOI, they needed to crunch a letter from MAD to make the K fit for the partnership
[1:17:10] Kaniskion: classic perkz
[1:17:10] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[1:17:40] TheTraderKing: they should chant the name of the guy that feeds
[1:18:02] gorwings: the elyoya chants... will they keep that energy when this team is down?
[1:18:12] fx_fanslowika: @gorwings spoiler they did not
[1:18:15] David_P00le: @MonteCristo for your own sanity please dont pay attention to kaisers boubles
[1:18:23] Bladetykon: what are the teams?
[1:18:25] fljqpy: they will just chant layoyo when hes down
[1:18:30] TheTraderKing: SUPA SUPA SUPA LUL
[1:18:38] haroony123: @bladetykon t1 vs geng
[1:19:37] fljqpy: why not MLK
[1:19:43] gorwings: or mk?
[1:19:49] Manjiji: mdk was a good game
[1:19:54] Bladetykon: I was also ver confused
[1:19:59] Bladetykon: what mdk means
[1:20:02] TastyAMG: They should have just picked one brand and stuck with it rather than putting the two together into 1 shit brand
[1:20:14] fx_fanslowika: the brand does not matter for spaniards
[1:20:20] fx_fanslowika: what matters they are spanish and ibai is with them
[1:20:39] RichardHag: Monte have you been underwhelmed by the overall level in LEC so far?
[1:20:59] fljqpy: how can it be good
[1:20:59] najafan: They should call themselves THE Mad Lions Koi.
[1:21:00] TheSoloStoner: hey monte congrats on the new baby!!!
[1:21:07] boked_seeker: very true. even g2
[1:21:07] najafan: Or, say, TDK.
[1:21:16] archie7497: If the merger was only between mad lion and movistar riders without koi then the name could have been mad riders. That sounds so much better than mad lions koi
[1:21:41] Grumahr: what do you think about lcs playing on live patch now?
[1:21:49] MissingMatter: Or all three and they could've been Mad Koi Riders @archie7497
[1:21:51] David_P00le: tbf i veel like SK has been relativly clean compared to the other teams
[1:22:07] archie7497: @missingmatter fair
[1:22:17] haroony123: why am i sitting here brainstorming better chants than the actual fans that pay to go to the arena

[1:22:25] fljqpy: league clown championship LUL
[1:22:26] MissingMatter: Yes, it'd be a shame if they had to pause the game at some point...
[1:22:47] Fortune49: Whats your favorite thing about the overall changes? Mythic removal? No stopwatch?
[1:22:52] Voltiate: Monte hates insects?
[1:22:53] TastyAMG: Nope
[1:22:56] najafan: Absolutely boring to me imo
[1:22:58] Bestiality_Is_Just_A_Word: Did you plan your child's birth around Riot's off season? That is a worrying trend
[1:23:00] TastyAMG: i'd rather have less pauses
[1:23:05] fljqpy: for LCS i like it
[1:23:08] haroony123: nah when i see jensen int it in lcs, i wanna do the same 1 min later
[1:23:08] fljqpy: they have nothing else
[1:23:09] d_kowalski: I only watch anyway
[1:23:09] Grumahr: ohh i also dont think so i still find it interesting as a concept
[1:23:09] TheEngllshDevil: a tiny amount
[1:23:11] Edwho: If it is a new season, I think it makes sense
[1:23:13] gorwings: i'd rather the leagues be coordinated in their patch selection
[1:23:15] RichardHag: My friends care a lot about same patch
[1:23:17] Goatsguffle: LCS is the highest form of League competitive play....
[1:23:20] TastyAMG: but riot has made it very clear they don't care about the esports fans they want to get more casuals in
[1:23:21] imainleesin: bro playing ryze LUL
[1:23:23] Voltiate: Nah, I'd rather have a better ecosystem that leads to better quality of games :)
[1:23:28] David_P00le: Oh god i didnt think about the increase in bugs, LEC had like 1 hour of pauses today without live patch
[1:23:37] Bladetykon: I always was curius since for dota there is only life patch
[1:23:37] najafan: Fewer pauses, bring back laneswaps.
[1:23:41] a_borop: what do you think about the recorded drafts to speed up transitions?
[1:24:12] archie7497: I don't lcare that much about the live patch bit but Monte I view this as a terminally I'll patient taking a experimental trial drug.
[1:24:18] TJ_Angel: I don't car too much, but last year, LCS was playing almost 2 patches off at one point. S o there must be a bit of match between live and pro
[1:24:28] haroony123: kaiser has become one with the fish brain
[1:24:45] Itsifi: Kaisers nami BibleThump
[1:24:48] Grumahr: doesnt dota have way less patches anyway?
[1:24:58] badsupport91: I personally would like to see fearless que in lcs and pro play, I cannot stand watching a b05 with aatrox top for 5 games straight.
[1:25:14] TastyAMG: @TJ_Angel why does pro and live have to be similar?
[1:25:20] fljqpy: fearless draft for lcs next
[1:25:32] Meep837594: in the live dota patch the roshan (the baron equivalent) attack animation is bugged so it looks like he's standing still but he's attacking
[1:25:36] imainleesin: i mean lookit these LCS rosters...
[1:25:39] tohighformicro: Based @archie7497
[1:25:48] dusT: Hello there Mr. Monte
[1:25:53] imainleesin: FQ and C9 look good, but thats it, maybe NRG
[1:25:54] TastyAMG: Pog Burger
[1:25:54] GPAlexander: wife win

[1:26:00] Kaniskion: KKona
[1:26:02] Grumahr: monte living the live :O
[1:26:03] najafan: Revert the old turret changes to bring back lane swaps! It's so easy to do!
[1:26:04] Dzy3D: lcs fearless draft soontm
[1:26:06] TastyAMG: Dust PogUU
[1:26:06] MarquisDeHueberez: one day they're just gonna be casting solo queue but not tell anyone just to see if the audience can tell teh difference
[1:26:10] Voltiate: more burgers Pog
[1:26:12] David_P00le: what's worse Kaiser Nami or Doss Bard?
[1:26:14] d_kowalski: Monte, did the talks about merging LCS with CBLOL progress in any way?
[1:26:31] Voltiate: AIN'T NO WAY
[1:26:31] TJ_Angel: @TastyAMG to me it's unfun seeing players build item that were nerfed. Like we sw a bunch of statikk shiv builds on pro, but none in real life cause it was nerfed. I honestly like seeing what they're building now, not what they were building weeks ago
[1:26:34] TastyAMG: @David_P00le Doss on anything
[1:26:37] chopabear: lets go frank burger
[1:26:38] fljqpy: why not
[1:26:52] beluga_12_3: does frank make a good burger though?
[1:26:55] chopabear: the icons look low res too
[1:27:02] gimmick_king: one of the burgers of all time
[1:27:03] ENV187: id much rather have frank burger than Frank Esports from the PCS
[1:27:05] dusT: that does straight up look like shakeshack
[1:27:14] archie7497: Is Korea like china with respect to ip rights infringement and inability to sue in court?

[1:27:21] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[1:27:22] TastyAMG: @TJ_Angel You can look up what they are building on the live patch in soloq
[1:27:23] TheEngllshDevil: @TJ_Angel I agree with pretty much all of this. Just makes your read on the game as a viewer off
[1:27:24] GPAlexander: that looks way too big to be a shake shack burger
[1:28:00] imainleesin: getting clapped by 4 rookies KEKO
[1:28:09] najafan: Ooh, they could bring back dfg to try and save LCS.
[1:28:12] fljqpy: imagine just letting foreign brands come in without copying their designs
[1:28:12] najafan: That could be fun.
[1:28:13] dusT: PRAISE BE you are enlightened. Shake shack is the best. IT SLAPS In-N-Out
[1:28:22] TJ_Angel: @TastyAMG If soloq >> LCS for you. That's your pov and it's totally fine. But pro to me is more important than soloq
[1:28:36] najafan: 5 guys > Shake Shack, smh
[1:28:45] dusT: @najafan Youre high
[1:28:51] Bestiality_Is_Just_A_Word: I don't care about LEC I want to hear about Korean burgers
[1:28:53] dusT: Five Guys has great fries, thats it
[1:28:53] imainleesin: im hungry now
[1:28:53] d_kowalski: What's the price for that in Korea
[1:28:55] zlrenyth: KKona those dem koreans are stealing from us !
[1:28:55] najafan: @dusT highly correct.
[1:28:58] dusT: Their burger is WAY WORSE
[1:28:58] Bestiality_Is_Just_A_Word: Korean burger tier list
[1:29:01] Voltiate: no clone, just Frank Burger :)
[1:29:03] TastyAMG: @TJ_Angel What you said implies the opposite. i care more about pro that's why i dont want it to be on the live patch so there are less bugs
[1:29:08] TheEngllshDevil: @dusT 5guys is a great burder, just expensive
[1:29:26] haroony123: @montecristo what if frank is the original and only korea is giving him a chance?
[1:29:27] dusT: Shake SHack slaps five guys and in n out
[1:29:38] dusT: Five guys does have the best fries though
[1:29:39] archie7497: Lmao
[1:29:42] najafan: Not a massive in n out fan, I'll admit.
[1:29:46] fljqpy: 7-1
[1:29:51] najafan: But I think 5 guys is just better all around.
[1:29:59] dusT: Best chicken is Nandos
[1:30:02] TastyAMG: @najafan it is
[1:30:07] Voltiate: LMAO
[1:30:08] dusT: GOTTEM
[1:30:09] TastyAMG: Bra7-1L
[1:30:09] beluga_12_3: HAHA
[1:30:09] TheEngllshDevil: @dusT cheeky
[1:30:11] AsiaPowa: LOL
[1:30:13] mv_peter: Love it
[1:30:13] GPAlexander: is it in fact good enough monte?
[1:30:14] David_P00le: thats fucking class
[1:30:15] TastyAMG: kinda Based
[1:30:20] TheEngllshDevil: Thats Based
[1:30:24] dusT: That sounds like Tier 2/3 casting managers
[1:30:27] biggerbeefey: Good ol apathetic marketing
[1:30:36] d_kowalski: "Doesn't make you run to the bathroom"
[1:30:57] imainleesin: do you upload these banger only vods to youtube?
[1:31:04] fljqpy: ad lb LUL
[1:31:05] TJ_Angel: @TastyAMG Most of the patches are just buffs and nerfs of champions/items/monsters, not total reworks of champions. The chances of having a bug because Riot decide to increase the AP ratio of champion X by Y is bar none
[1:31:06] archie7497: That is such a good tagline
[1:31:14] dusT: @imainleesin Frank Burgers Only actually
[1:31:16] najafan: @MonteCristo Do you think bringing back DFG would save LCS? Hmmm.
[1:31:28] imainleesin: SeemsGood

[1:32:07] TastyAMG: @TJ_Angel You are severely underestimating how badly the game is coded LuL
[1:32:11] biggerbeefey: @MonteCristo Do you think that the new map changes will have significant impact on level ones and early game invades or are the changes too minor

[1:43:02] gorwings: it's easier to catch you live than summoning insight
[1:43:06] David_P00le: @Scruffymonkeh I'll try that some time next week, i really wanna get into NFL so lets see how much i enjoy it
[1:43:09] kup95: @David_P00le google nfl full game replays
[1:43:15] Grumahr: man i cant wait to see the first TSM games this season since all the major regions start now we should see them play soon right? Kappa
[1:43:16] PaulyGee: the fnatic game from today shows very well how broken mages can be if they get like 2 or 3 items decently fast on this patch

[1:43:58] clippityycloppityy: game of the week tbh
[1:43:59] Riqui__: SK MAD is extra entertaining knowing Nisqy and Elyoya dont get along anymore
[1:44:05] brodrian: First bump after the march was hilarious
[1:44:09] galaxxx123: did you see the rogue game? that legit made me quit the stream
[1:44:10] kup95: the first link nfl-video is pretty reliable
[1:44:12] Scruffymonkeh: @David_P00le  i mean the highlights wont really set the pace correctly or show you the lining up in a way you can really evaluate it. but you can at least see a bit. especially if romo is casting
[1:44:13] boked_seeker: France vs Spain incoming
[1:44:25] brodrian: Yeah Rogue just seem totally boomed
[1:44:28] Riqui__: @Riqui__ dont want to spoil anything but will be funny to keep in mind watching that game
[1:44:38] gorwings: i think it depends on team. BDS got out in front of G2 but then never converted their lead
[1:44:42] MissingMatter: @David_P00le NFL is basically a 10-15 minute game that takes 3 hours, so it's much better to watch a broadcast than live. There are going to be lots of replays.
[1:44:45] David_P00le: @Riqui__ SK winning was a fucking blessing, Nisqy is so much more likable
[1:44:55] archie7497: Holy shit rogue is dogahit
[1:44:58] jorahaha: Nisqy had the coldest handshake with Elyoya after this match
[1:45:01] imainleesin: rip Mac Lions

[1:45:36] fljqpy: that burger got to him
[1:45:37] najafan: Please say he did.
[1:45:38] kup95: @david_p00le pick a favorite team/player watch their games plus playoffs and you ll get into it more I took me about a year when I moved to the US
[1:45:51] David_P00le: The shush from Exakick after this game was so nice
[1:45:51] TastyAMG: @najafan it was an Akali game weirdly enough
[1:45:53] najafan: I've been asking him to play led mid since C9.
[1:45:54] TastyAMG: and he looked good on it
[1:45:58] najafan: Kled*

[1:49:27] franch1ze: have you been playing BG3 solo monte? those streams with doa were so good
[1:49:36] najafan: And poppy is a pretty good counter into those champs
[1:49:49] galaxxx123: BOP
[1:49:54] franch1ze: dark harvest poppy is fun
[1:49:56] fljqpy: dank harvest WutFace
[1:50:41] GPAlexander: them seeding new accounts into gold/plat is so dumb
[1:50:43] Riqui__: id love to see some monte playing soloq
[1:50:59] imainleesin: LEC fans go hard
[1:51:00] najafan: Just duo with LS. :P

[1:51:17] kup95: what champ(s) would  you like to see in the meta again? i enjoyed early seasons with Karthus annivia
[1:51:28] galaxxx123: you think? I think you can get out of touch with the routine?
[1:51:38] noyea96: @WatarieTV would pay for that vid
[1:51:42] David_P00le: was this the paus where they started interviewing peopel backstage or is that the other paus
[1:51:43] fljqpy: holy pause
[1:51:44] Lamynator: plat in Korea sounds really good, isn't that basically challenger in NA?
[1:51:44] galaxxx123: or how to call it LUL
[1:51:47] TastyAMG: This delay was insanely long
[1:51:54] eagle_constant: hi, i found this stream through the dilfgamer tag :)
[1:51:58] galaxxx123: yeah LEC is fcking doomed
[1:51:58] Riqui__: Sjokz was carrying hard during this pause
[1:52:00] 911212356: riot sucking off the french fans
[1:52:04] TastyAMG: @eagle_constant PogChamp
[1:52:15] d_kowalski: Yeah, watching live wasn't pretty
[1:52:15] mv_peter: He knows what he WANTS
[1:52:24] najafan: I saw someone from another community play league with Ovilee for the first time and she THREATENED him when he contemplated going into ranked without any practice.
[1:52:40] WatarieTV: I'm masters NA, am I even allowed to play ranked in KR

[1:54:59] fljqpy: (+3% bonus health) --> why god
[1:55:00] WatarieTV: Meta will be weird, burst AP assassins are good but so are MR items
[1:55:05] galaxxx123: @paroto7 there were many metas where adc takes broken supp item its prob same shit it was many times already
[1:55:11] David_P00le: @Paroto7 The supp items when completed are fucking busted and the penalty for taking cs isnt that big of the thing if both laners have the items and are sharing
[1:55:31] najafan: @galaxxx123 I remember the first patch of S4  relic shield, holy hell.
[1:55:36] fljqpy: delete support items
[1:55:46] najafan: Wasn't melee only.
[1:55:53] najafan: Just doubled gold in lane.
[1:56:02] eagle_constant: lucian could've flashed too
[1:56:11] WatarieTV: Monte, do you think if a team attempted the old lane swap meta in 2024 (even with weaker turret bot), they would win some games just because no one would know how to counterplay it? (Covering dives etc)
[1:56:14] imainleesin: who is Isma?
[1:56:38] galaxxx123: @najafan yeah that thing was disgusting with draven/kalista
[1:56:53] galaxxx123: @najafan was kalista in s4? now I have no idea LUL
[1:56:53] najafan: They really should change those buffs back.
[1:57:04] najafan: Bring back lane swaps.
[1:57:07] PabloSnackobar: how does the newmap affect ganking?
[1:57:13] fljqpy: LUL
[1:57:15] WatarieTV: I used to play some LANS in my city and we'd just lane swap and win games vs much better players because they had 0 idea how to react.
[1:57:16] imainleesin: LUL
[1:57:16] franch1ze: lol
[1:57:20] najafan: @galaxxx123 Nah, Kalista was later. This was the FIRST patch.
[1:57:21] fx_fanslowika: myrwn didnt play in movistar

[1:58:38] Riqui__: @ENV187 correct
[1:58:42] archie7497: Btw Isma is the guy who got fired from schalke for saying sub human.
[1:58:50] najafan: Kalista was late S4, iirc.
[1:58:53] fx_fanslowika: yes
[1:58:55] ENV187: thats what iove been calling him
[1:59:06] fx_fanslowika: my ears hurt every time casters say his name
[1:59:13] Grumahr: when is next summoning insight Tuesday?
[1:59:29] Riqui__: Alvaro is a bit of a mithy lookalike btw
[1:59:30] fx_fanslowika: ye
[1:59:30] Grumahr: nice
[1:59:43] galaxxx123: @najafan damn I started when zed was released LUL
[1:59:44] fx_fanslowika: and im still wondering why im seeing fresskowy on my screen
[1:59:58] imainleesin: clean by poppy there
[2:00:01] TastyAMG: irrelevant could have lived there i think if he went the other way
[2:00:30] fljqpy: nesquik having fun
[2:00:32] Riqui__: üëç
[2:01:31] galaxxx123: oh yeah that was exactly my thought until you get to midgame
[2:01:37] fx_fanslowika: they play the same opening they played when they were in superliga
[2:01:40] najafan: @galaxxx123 Yasuo for me.
[2:01:43] fx_fanslowika: they just exchanged their jungler
[2:01:48] Riqui__: I think people unfairly underestimated them. they were basically a top ERL team that got Elyoya
[2:01:59] galaxxx123: I assume its gonna be this way for alot mad games insane early game plato in midgame
[2:02:02] TastyAMG: why is the baron timer up at 10 minutes LuL
[2:02:07] franch1ze: lol vedius
[2:02:14] PabloSnackobar: what do you think will the early meta be in s14?
[2:02:16] fljqpy: tru
[2:02:25] najafan: Er, Jinx, not Yasuo
[2:02:25] fljqpy: the grubhub special
[2:02:26] airbrid: do they still have that sponsorship?
[2:02:27] MocaShakaKhan: you know they won't
[2:02:28] fx_fanslowika: @Riqui__ yeah and supa is rly good rookie that was hyped justifiably so was myrwn so team has potential
[2:02:34] gorwings: will there even be a grub counter on screen?
[2:02:37] TuxedoMasquerade: literally just start calling baron pit the grub hub
[2:03:10] Shobes572: thoughts on Wendy‚Äôs?

[2:03:10] gorwings: they were trying to name the grubs every game
[2:03:18] archie7497: People literally call it grubhub in soloq
[2:03:20] GPAlexander: yooo. the grub hub power play?
[2:03:23] Shadowless10: Wouldn't the fountain be the GrubHub that heals you?
[2:03:28] TastyAMG: @fx_fanslowika idk supa hasn't looked that great in LEC so far and the level isn't exactly at an all time high
[2:03:37] TastyAMG: Small sample size ofc
[2:03:45] David_P00le: they should fully commit and use a custom skin that turns the Grubs into The Grubhub logo with legs
[2:03:54] fx_fanslowika: @TastyAMG i mostly looked at his superliga games and his eum games
[2:03:54] gorwings: ed edd n eddy, bubbles, blossom, and buttercup, or hewey, dewey and louie
[2:03:59] catast999: patience working as intended
[2:04:04] TastyAMG: This is a bug apparently
[2:04:05] fx_fanslowika: he has insane teamfighting but has the same problems carzzy once had
[2:04:07] David_P00le: The aggro is beucase SK is holding aggro of 1 of them
[2:04:10] PaulyGee: ah yeah the aggro not resetting because one is aggroed in the pit
[2:04:12] Riqui__: they dont lose patience since one of them is in the pit
[2:04:17] shahzaad: Is this bug abuse?
[2:04:25] archie7497: It's bugged
[2:04:25] fljqpy: no its not abuse
[2:04:28] imainleesin: that looks sus
[2:04:28] Grumahr: looks like it caedrel said its a bug
[2:04:38] galaxxx123: its a bug but its not abuse?
[2:04:41] fatalqwerty: What does Monte think about the Cowboys and their epic match against the Packers? Did he already do a diatribe about the Cowboy's OP strats?
[2:04:47] Nytrodark: its a bug
[2:04:53] fljqpy: no its not a bug
[2:05:04] Grumahr: yeah i know what u mean idk if thats intended tho ^^
[2:05:09] PaulyGee: not a bug but also not intented i would say LUL
[2:05:16] Nytrodark: they might patch this
[2:05:31] TastyAMG: @PaulyGee if its not intended its a bug
[2:05:32] Nytrodark: well thats too far from the pit
[2:05:33] MocaShakaKhan: no edge testing i guess.
[2:05:41] TastyAMG: it is very funny tho
[2:05:44] Clyde1500: you mean to tell me riot coded something poorly? I'm shocked Kappa
[2:05:46] najafan: If (boolean in pit), rather than If (1 in pit)
[2:05:49] najafan: Probably
[2:05:56] Alwlyan: if its not intented then id say it is a bug
[2:05:57] Grumahr: spaghetti code at worlk :D
[2:06:02] David_P00le: wait could you have a grub follow you into the fountain
[2:06:03] PaulyGee: @TastyAMG its just an oversight? so not a bug
[2:06:31] fljqpy: yea u cant call that a bug
[2:06:33] najafan: It's just that 1 being in pit will satisfy it, is my guess.
[2:06:34] MocaShakaKhan: copy and paste the herald code probably
[2:06:42] najafan: A single Boolean variable mediating it.
[2:06:48] archie7497: Doss is so bad
[2:06:54] najafan: Rather than consciously saying 1 in pit.
[2:07:18] Riqui__: I think there is some stuff they dont want all grubs to be seperate for. such as cho gath ult getting stacks. prob just hard to code all the seperate instances when you want the grubs to be seperate and when to be one
[2:07:22] archie7497: Why use flash ignite. Poppy has tp
[2:07:40] TastyAMG: @PaulyGee Anything that's in the game and not intended to be there is a bug that's how the term is used in the gaming industry its literally just if the dev says so or not. until riot says if its intended or not its a mechanic if not then its a bug
[2:08:15] galaxxx123: what were the changes to the format? you still play on that constant straining teams?
[2:08:15] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[2:08:19] Naku_NA: Renata tehter
[2:08:24] TastyAMG: SK PogChamp
[2:08:28] mv_peter: Handshake
[2:08:33] najafan: Well that's not true, there's emergent behavior. @TastyAMG
[2:08:57] najafan: Bugs are a specific type of emergent behavior.
[2:09:01] mv_peter: Looked like he went up in the air to ult but died mid cast
[2:09:31] Naku_NA: Were you asking about Exa or Alvaro?
[2:09:34] Naku_NA: Yeah
[2:09:55] fljqpy: haunting guise WutFace
[2:10:09] PaulyGee: @TastyAMG well its a mechanic right now, but if you would ask them if it should be like that then they would probably say no. so its not a bug but also not intended, because they just forgot/coded it badly. obviously thats just speculation, but in that scenario i would call it not a bug but also not intended
[2:10:20] archie7497: Can milio not ult while he is cc'd?
[2:10:47] mv_peter: Supa this fight
[2:10:51] mv_peter: Was crazy
[2:10:57] Naku_NA: That sup not the greatest move by supa
[2:11:05] Sjkaev: wat
[2:11:08] Scruffymonkeh: head empty
[2:11:10] Riqui__: a bit of inting
[2:11:13] catast999: western spacing
[2:11:16] archie7497: Intinf
[2:11:18] fx_fanslowika: ye thats supa special
[2:11:24] fx_fanslowika: carzzy 2020 like player
[2:11:28] fatalqwerty: Run it down BigBrother
[2:11:30] TastyAMG: :tf: we do a bit of trolling
[2:11:30] Nytrodark: thats pretty grief yeah
[2:11:37] Riqui__: the wildturtle special
[2:11:41] beluga_12_3: literally dashes into him haha
[2:11:43] fljqpy: walk into? nah i should DASH into renek
[2:11:48] David_P00le: walking in is better then he did, atleast hecould have dashed away then
[2:11:48] Nytrodark: going melee range into renekton
[2:11:48] mv_peter: Even worse he Ed in
[2:11:50] Scruffymonkeh: should I dash into him or walk into him FeelsDankMan
[2:11:58] TastyAMG: we just saw this why are we instantly doing a replay FeelsDankMan
[2:12:04] archie7497: Not even walking straight up dashing in
[2:12:06] Loxi9: mdk more like mdr
[2:12:08] Riqui__: he just wants to turn on him since he is seperatef rom his team but ppor execution
[2:12:10] Grumahr: he thought he can oneshot rene xD
[2:12:20] PaulyGee: "guys just gonna one shot renekton real quick"
[2:12:24] najafan: I would waste my E on the tank. :clueless:
[2:12:39] fx_fanslowika: nah he just has brain issues sometimes
[2:12:45] SHawkeye77: pog vod reviews
[2:13:00] TastyAMG: @fx_fanslowika Great trait for an ADC to have LuL
[2:13:01] RDKi: Is it just me or in these games where they're choosing Jax jungle, they need to swap it into a side lane after 20 mins - maybe even take smite/tp. It seems strictly worse in jungle than lane without the 1v1 side lane pressure/farm
[2:13:01] archie7497: Reminder that supa is 2 years older than carzzy
[2:13:04] MocaShakaKhan: dont even need dash at that range
[2:13:16] imainleesin: lmao actually greifing
[2:13:16] fljqpy: pepega move

[2:13:16] Naku_NA: I wonder if he wanted to do that and just whiffed the direction of his e
[2:13:24] najafan: He wanted to show off that he could animation cancel.
[2:13:38] David_P00le: @Naku_NA nah there is no way you can whiff like that
[2:13:41] fx_fanslowika: thorins gonna hate supa though
[2:13:44] Naku_NA: I hope not, cause pro
[2:13:51] fx_fanslowika: he certainly isnt upset/rekkles type of adc
[2:13:57] Riqui__: G2 KC is gonna tilt monte
[2:13:58] galaxxx123: I mean it seemed simple cuz he was facechecking a brush but its still vision game its kinda tricky sometimes its like when magnus carlsen forget how knights move
[2:14:09] galaxxx123: bush* lol
[2:14:10] PaulyGee: @Riqui__ already watched
[2:14:17] Riqui__: aaawwhw
[2:14:19] Riqui__: shit
[2:14:20] Naku_NA: @galaxxx123 It was warded
[2:14:22] Riqui__: did you get tilted?
[2:14:30] galaxxx123: @naku_na oh
[2:14:36] homelander369: Is monte and wolf show still gng on this season?
[2:14:51] d_kowalski: It's still early in Europe
[2:14:57] the_omegarose: It's crazy how I went from being a MAD fan from the Peter Dunn Splyce days to not caring at all about this team.
[2:15:07] najafan: Will MonteCristo Reads have new uploads this year?
[2:15:08] Exedra711: ive liked how sk has played out their games, i think ISMA has some qualityt
[2:15:28] Nytrodark: today is monday right>?
[2:15:29] galaxxx123: if sk keep it up they gonna have my vote to win it all
[2:15:45] najafan: @NytroDark depends on where you are.
[2:15:56] fatalqwerty: thoughts on Rookern as an item?
[2:15:58] kingruben7: Monte sleep stream pls
[2:16:10] Riqui__: first yoya vs nisqy
[2:16:13] homelander369: Cant wait for t1 vs geng on wed
[2:16:18] Scruffymonkeh: that spectator announcement thing was weird
[2:16:29] najafan: @MonteCristo Just read Foucault's Pendulum on stream PogChamp
[2:16:43] galaxxx123: Bo nisqy would be such a fire combo but seeing this selfish nisqy is weird
[2:16:55] fatalqwerty: that was a good ult from rell
[2:16:56] BeatFromTheEast: Ty for the true detective recommendation. I was pleasantly surprised by Alexandra daddario in episode 2
[2:17:04] fx_fanslowika: @galaxxx123 he said that he wants to develop as a player after last worlds experience
[2:17:12] fljqpy: god DAMN
[2:17:15] TastyAMG: SK played this fight so well
[2:17:26] archie7497: Wait did the gragas ult hit anyone?
[2:17:39] najafan: Oh, True Detective was such a let down.
[2:18:06] fatalqwerty: he aligns them like bowling pins before going in there
[2:18:11] Exedra711: I rate isma hes good
[2:18:15] archie7497: Oh nvm
[2:18:21] Riqui__: Feel liek Poppy W shouldve stopped akali there
[2:18:21] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[2:18:32] Scruffymonkeh: 25 more ap on gragas probably wouldve been enough but just not there

[2:18:47] fljqpy: what lol
[2:18:49] BeatFromTheEast: BeatFromTheEast subscribed with Prime. 
[2:18:56] shahzaad: Sk legit looks the cleanest....
[2:18:57] imainleesin: god kallista baron soo bad
[2:19:10] the_omegarose: Nisqy somehow makes every team he joins better than you expect
[2:19:18] galaxxx123: you know what wasnt a letdown s2 of invincible i finally watched it I am so obsessed
[2:19:23] Clyde1500: How is the baron pit determined? is it based on dragon map?
[2:19:36] Nytrodark: i want to see hwei already.
[2:19:36] the_omegarose: I expected not much from this Sk team but so far they're impressive
[2:19:37] Riqui__: like wtf that akali ult through poppy w
[2:19:43] najafan: I meant the first one! I remember watching it weekly with friends who had read Nietzsche and Lovecraft and we were getting so excited for it actually maybe being truly weird, brilliant fiction. When it was ultimately just a detective story rather than something uncanny.
[2:19:46] TastyAMG: I'd take Nisqy over any midlaner not named caps in EU atm he's so good
[2:19:50] David_P00le: @Clyde1500 nope, tehre are 3 version of baron and its randomly chosen
[2:19:55] fatalqwerty: that was virtually a 4v5 from SK for majority of the fight too
[2:19:58] fatalqwerty: really well played
[2:20:05] najafan: It was still, you know, fine. But not what we expected it to be.
[2:20:06] fljqpy: where was the bailout
[2:20:11] Clyde1500: @David_P00le ohhh ok. thanks
[2:20:16] TastyAMG: i do want to see Hwei in pro play she either completely ints or dominates in solo queue
[2:20:22] archie7497: Hwei is so shit if anyone gets on top of him
[2:20:42] Exedra711: @archie7497 i think hwei is gonna be busted
[2:20:46] galaxxx123: I mean they shouldnt I feel like they just get outscaled so fast
[2:20:50] fatalqwerty: Hwei is so good if you're on a kite team tho, it's good that he has obvious strenghts and weaknesses
[2:20:54] Nytrodark: what do you think of league of legends invoker? do you think the normal audience is going to be confused by him?
[2:21:08] archie7497: @exedra711 not on 14.1 before the hotfix buffs
[2:21:25] Riqui__: just dont 2v2 4Head
[2:21:27] fljqpy: the rework is trash
[2:21:33] najafan: I like old ASol.
[2:21:36] najafan: They ruined him.
[2:21:38] fatalqwerty: do you autoban ASol in ranked too Monte? LUL
[2:21:40] Cipherflare: Are you interested in Percy Jackson and the Olympians for a Greek mythology fan? @montecristo
[2:21:45] gorwings: caps made it sound like they're going to the hotfix patch next week
[2:21:50] gorwings: so we might se hwei then?
[2:21:51] TastyAMG: it was pretty funny on that first patch after the asol rework he was just Thanos
[2:21:54] archie7497: Mid asol/kayle/ kass just a black hole
[2:21:58] Grumahr: what your favourite champ monte?
[2:22:02] Exedra711: @archie7497 true
[2:22:11] the_omegarose: Those books were my childhood
[2:22:11] fljqpy: nah hwei is not hard to understand
[2:22:13] RomanticCreampie: sounds like zoomer YA trash
[2:22:24] Clyde1500: I read the first book again recently. It was an ok kids book.
[2:22:27] Nytrodark: its a anime right?
[2:22:32] gorwings: have  you watched foundation?
[2:22:34] najafan: Are you and DoA watching the new Doctor Who stuff for Nerd Legion?
[2:22:34] Duje275: Have you maybe watched the time travel show Dark on netflix maybe?
[2:22:34] the_omegarose: @RomanticCreampie you take that back sir
[2:22:36] commando1814: the side kick in that show is the best - blue eye
[2:22:49] fatalqwerty: millenial yuppie trash > zoomer yuppie trash FeelsGoodMan
[2:22:53] galaxxx123: AYAYA does it have catgirls?
[2:22:55] PaulyGee: yeah "friendlyspaceninja" on youtube is a series reviewer and he had blue eyed samurai as his #1 for 2023
[2:22:57] RomanticCreampie: @RomanticCreampie  reckH
[2:23:09] Shadowless10: Wakfu is not anime!
[2:23:11] najafan: @Duje275 If you like Dark, I highly recommend The Devil's Hour.
[2:23:14] Exedra711: agreed
[2:23:19] Grumahr: damn has really good ratings i might give it a try
[2:23:23] commando1814: it's so damn visually stunning

[2:23:32] W1ndows: I didn't know anime was the champagne of animation. It can only be anime if it comes from the anime region of japan?
[2:23:35] BeatFromTheEast: Have you seen asteroid city or grand Budapest hotel?
[2:23:53] archie7497: Why are there so many animation studios in France btw? Are they all weebs or what
[2:24:06] TheTraderKing: man I feel like mid lane is the most tilting role... when I support and go like 0/5/32  i am not too upset because at least I feel like I faccilitated a good player, but when I play carry and lose going 20/5/10   I am pissed at my boosted teammates who cant even barely do their jobs
[2:24:21] galaxxx123: only anime I really liked through and through was castelvania
[2:24:26] fatalqwerty: thoughts on The Expanse, if you've ever watched it before
[2:24:27] Duje275: @najafan Like dark? hahahahha i put it straight into my veins dog. Watched it all in 1 day while the 3rd season wasn't out yet. will give it a look
[2:24:31] Lamynator: @archie7497 why do you equate animation with weeb content Archie?
[2:24:48] Naku_NA: @Lamynator Don't take the bait
[2:24:49] imainleesin: the expanse is on amazon right?
[2:24:50] fljqpy: 5k gold lead
[2:24:53] najafan: @Duje275 Watch the trailer on yt and see if it works for you.
[2:24:56] RomanticCreampie: i liked first 2 seasons... got too bored with later ones
[2:24:57] commando1814: would you ever throw amus out the airlock ?
[2:25:02] fatalqwerty: Another Beltalowda Kreygasm

[2:25:11] TastyAMG: Arcane? BatChest
[2:25:25] BeatFromTheEast: Have you seen the Korean movie the handmaiden?
[2:25:29] MocaShakaKhan: the tsm special?
[2:25:31] galaxxx123: Is that gragas from season 2 arcane? BatChest
[2:25:33] galaxxx123: holyyy
[2:25:33] fljqpy: baron for nexus PogChamp
[2:25:39] najafan: Any plans to watch the new Doctor Who stuff now that Russell T Davies is back?
[2:25:40] archie7497: @lamynator just because
[2:25:49] commando1814: @gorwings how are the main apple plus sci fi shows ?? foundation invasion silo
[2:26:05] fljqpy: that area near t1 mid turret is so open
[2:26:08] Riqui__: very good rene stun to stop poppy ult
[2:26:17] TastyAMG: ^
[2:26:31] commando1814: renek was clutch
[2:26:54] TastyAMG: Flash stun to cancel poppy ult was YUGE
[2:26:56] gorwings: @commando1814 haven't watched the others. just foundation. i found it very good.
[2:27:13] galaxxx123: yeah he is sacrificing here classic nisqy style
[2:27:26] commando1814: @gorwings I'll watch ep one and see if it's for me
[2:27:30] zer088: gragas looks so funny waddling around the fught
[2:27:32] the_omegarose: good stun from irrelevant on the poppy ult
[2:27:37] MocaShakaKhan: isn't mad's win condition at this point to pick some one off. seems doomed to fight sk 5v5 at this point. if poppy doesn't knock anyone out
[2:27:37] Riqui__: after
[2:27:38] archie7497: Hysterics is actually so fun to listen too
[2:27:45] commando1814: gotta find a show to watch while I wait for Fargo to finish

[2:35:10] fatalqwerty: LUL they removed the part where he massacres maegara and his children because of Hera Rage

[2:36:08] gorwings: robin williams as the genie was fantastic though
[2:36:10] fljqpy: its just a knockoff shake shack
[2:36:14] fatalqwerty: Okay what about Hunchback of the Notre Dame Monte... c'mon you know it's also a banger
[2:36:24] najafan: I really hope Bard wins xD. I‚Äôm a Bard main and he‚Äôs just so fun!! People get so trolled by the magical journey, and his voice lines are so cute like when he goes OOOOOOMMMMM LOL! He‚Äôs super random but also meeper than he looks, just like me xD
[2:36:27] JakeJr: Sure, they take massive 'inspiration' from other classic pieces of literature, but they make them palatable for younger audiences.
[2:36:43] TastyAMG: Omg is this the doss bard game?
[2:36:45] David_P00le: Brave, wall-e, rango are my favourites

[2:37:04] Exedra711: i think lion king fuckin sucks
[2:37:06] mv_peter: It s 7 samurai yes
[2:37:14] fatalqwerty: everything is a Seven Samurai derivative LuL
[2:37:20] chrisedgeworth: No these are all original ideas‚Ñ¢
[2:37:24] GPAlexander: Rebel moon looks like a shitty young adult novel adaptation
[2:37:26] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: Toy Story 1/2?
[2:37:27] Clyde1500: I think we need 7 adaptations
[2:37:29] galaxxx123: its 4 hours?
[2:37:34] JakeJr: so much of contemporary film is style over substance. it's tragic
[2:37:39] TastyAMG: omg watch doss this game his bard play is a war crime @MonteCristo
[2:37:40] JakeJr: like tell me a good fucking story please

[2:37:56] MocaShakaKhan: seven samurai knockoffs
[2:38:00] Nytrodark: the walt disney companys creativity is not it anymore. they just buy companies to do the creative work for them. disneys magic is dead to me.

[2:43:53] archie7497: @kerokerogrips KEKW
[2:43:59] najafan: It's like a pro naming themselves "fakest".
[2:44:01] Fire_elemen6: The only thing that was banger about LEC this weekend was the sound of all the tech exploding between every game for some reason
[2:44:06] David_P00le: @kerokerogrips nah somebody has taken the western side of the gap and fucking pulled it away instead of shoving it closer to the LPL/LCK
[2:44:18] fljqpy: nah the lcs lec gap is closing
[2:44:27] najafan: It just invites bad comparisons.
[2:44:33] d_kowalski: Oh I forgot. The Rogue games are literally unwatchable. This org went through two name changes but never ceased to be the leagues' most boring team
[2:44:38] TastyAMG: @kerokerogrips its never been wider

[2:46:35] fortant69: @TastyAMG i dont exactly play solo queue these days
[2:46:42] DonRaynor: chat, has Monte watched BDS? did he ewnjoy ICE? KEKHeim
[2:46:44] TwiceTSTS: This RGE squad would lose against the 10th place NA team, they are shameful
[2:47:02] fljqpy: if there even IS a 10th place NA team LUL
[2:47:14] najafan: Also, can I just say that BDS has the worst team name ever?
[2:47:22] TastyAMG: NA doesn't even have 10 teams
[2:47:25] TastyAMG: LuL
[2:47:33] TwiceTSTS: exactly
[2:47:43] galaxxx123: @najafan well they are not giantx atleast its easy to say
[2:47:47] DonRaynor: @najafan nah, BDS has such meme potential, with just one M
[2:47:54] fljqpy: nesquik doing well SeemsGood
[2:48:01] alex0001111: why is larssen considered one of the best mids in eu when he only plays controle mages.
[2:48:12] galaxxx123: @najafan aka giant sex
[2:48:21] najafan: Nah, "BDS" literally means something pretty controversial in geopolitics.
[2:48:33] Grumahr: he is good sylas
[2:48:36] boked_seeker: he had a clutch sylas series
[2:48:41] najafan: So naming your team after it is just really silly.
[2:48:45] DonRaynor: @najafan But BDS makes me the M every time I watch them
[2:48:56] fljqpy: the whole winter split should be discounted
[2:48:56] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo

[2:49:58] JakeJr: What do you think of the rift tweaks @MonteCristo?
[2:50:05] JakeJr: paths, etc.
[2:50:11] Nytrodark: i hate watching control players theyre so boring to watch
[2:50:14] galaxxx123: @najafan omg another israel employee not everything has to be israel drama bro
[2:50:38] najafan: @galaxxx123 Didn't say it did? Just that it was silly for their brand.
[2:50:39] DonRaynor: there's many walls that are the "wrong" thickness, with weird flash angles.
[2:50:50] galaxxx123: @najafan you cant possibly say they saw it when the organization is literally older than the israel problem
[2:51:16] fljqpy: i just want supports and junglers to be poor
[2:51:17] fatalqwerty: what does BDS even mean?
[2:51:25] najafan: @galaxxx123 They were founded in 2019...
[2:51:27] fatalqwerty: And yeah Graves sucks as a MU versus taliyah
[2:51:36] galaxxx123: @fatalqwerty apperently its sanction against israel
[2:51:36] boked_seeker: rumble gonna be permabanned
[2:51:39] JakeJr: Can you speculate on why you think Riot made these kinds of changes?
[2:51:44] Grumahr: pretts sure bds stands for the name of the owner
[2:51:57] David_P00le: here it comes
[2:52:10] JakeJr: Sorry, I meant in terms of the map as it may apply to macro
[2:52:11] David_P00le: the worst Bard Q
[2:52:14] fatalqwerty: @galaxxx123 that's dumb lol, nobody owns an acronym
[2:52:18] asylumofmind: hey monte, just came by to say i hate the new items
[2:52:33] DonRaynor: sometimes. I feel like Riot is run as idiocracy...
[2:52:37] fatalqwerty: same I hope SK maintains this level of shotcalling throughout the season
[2:52:38] najafan: They say it's like Brave, Diverse, Supportive.
[2:52:45] fljqpy: its a game let them have fun
[2:52:50] fljqpy: its not the bible
[2:52:57] galaxxx123: @najafan wait thats crazy
[2:53:02] najafan: @fatalqwerty My point is just that it's bad brand management, not that they NEED to avoid it.
[2:53:10] David_P00le: he also misses his Q on the champs he ults

[2:54:42] najafan: The claim is literally just that it's bad PR. Agreeing that they don't care about the PR is ceding that.

[2:57:00] d_kowalski: No
[2:57:07] najafan: They holy war was won.
[2:57:08] Faramonde: To be fair, its been a few years since TSM were anywhere
[2:57:14] Fire_elemen6: I steal emotes from it
[2:57:28] najafan: It turned out TSM were albigensenians, not protestants.
[2:57:34] Riqui__: idk man this game was fine but solo laners kinda griefing

[2:58:09] Nytrodark: fuck EG, are they 100% gone now?
[2:58:16] d_kowalski: Still remember when Isma got thrown out in Schalke right before EU Masters, it's good that he still reached LEC
[2:58:26] HunQ_stream: You still find time to stream even with a newborn?
[2:58:36] fljqpy: that burger is getting to him
[2:58:43] r0ulette_: the real holy war will begin when regi buys t1 and the tsm1 lck reign begins

[2:59:32] Riqui__: monkaW Baron
[2:59:45] fatalqwerty: I dont think that'll happen tho, Regi fumbled his massively popular team, lost his GF to a sitting player, lost his team's slot in a league that he palyed a part founding on, it's JOEVER for him @r0ulette_
[2:59:46] kerokerogrips: what did quickshot mean when he said "do the hitler"  ??
[2:59:56] fljqpy: jhin bard sure is good
[3:00:02] MoldyCalzone: These fights are so much better without stopwatches everywhere
[3:00:16] archie7497: Isma played this fight very well
[3:00:16] fatalqwerty: LUL
[3:00:44] kerokerogrips: XDD maybe there are better names for that move
[3:00:48] Bladetykon: that new baron spawn animation reminds me of the worms with the googly eyes
[3:00:50] Grumahr: wait dont tell me thats why hes not in LEC?
[3:00:57] Grumahr: i9 saw that clip
[3:01:05] kerokerogrips: @Grumahr you are free to speculate
[3:01:06] Grumahr: thats such a overreaction
[3:01:16] commando1814: is he suspended officially?
[3:01:23] najafan: Yeah, you could call it the "M-F salute". (Not typing it cuz twitch)
[3:01:25] archie7497: Crazy how Goldberg is going scottfree when he was the one who posted the clip. Fucker deserves to be kicked more.
[3:01:29] plasmacastersalesman: crazy
[3:01:32] David_P00le: nah fuck off thats such a dumb reason
[3:01:41] Nytrodark: Huh? they cant get the joke?
[3:01:56] fatalqwerty: afaik germany is very strict about nazi stuff @NytroDark
[3:02:00] QuackTheDuck: is this the first day games?
[3:02:08] kerokerogrips: i mean didnt a fnc adc get the boot for a username referencing hitler in his username
[3:02:09] AzureCatalyst: The Nazi's stealing everything SMH
[3:02:11] preev0luti0n: the swastika is stolen too no?
[3:02:13] mv_peter: Chest bump + salute Yes?
[3:02:18] plasmacastersalesman: the swastika is very old aswell
[3:02:20] AzureCatalyst: Swastika was a buddist thing
[3:02:20] najafan: Well now you can say it's doing the Houthi
[3:02:21] archie7497: Stole Roman salute. Hindu symbol.
[3:02:21] fatalqwerty: I'm not surprised, they turned the swastika like 45 degrees and stole the sign
[3:02:22] gliese_58i: took the roman salute, took an indian symbol and modified it
[3:02:22] fx_fanslowika: yeah roman salute is still used by rightwing italians today
[3:02:22] Manjiji: they stole a lot of stuff
[3:02:23] commando1814: the US did the Roman salute till the 40s
[3:02:24] AzureCatalyst: They stole a bunch of artwork
[3:02:25] Freakoe: @archie7497 overreacting a bit
[3:02:27] r0ulette_: just when i thought the nazis couldn't get any worse üòî
[3:02:30] fortant69: disney and nazis have that in common
[3:02:48] fljqpy: damn the shake shack move
[3:02:54] ghosterath: Yeah because racists advertise that they are racist. So why didn't he say do the ancient Roman salute? @montecristo
[3:03:00] mv_peter: The more I hear about the Nazis, the less I like them
[3:03:09] r0ulette_: yeah i think it's that too :(
[3:03:10] najafan: @r0ulette_ Their blatant disregard for intellectual property.
[3:03:15] gliese_58i: I actually saw the hindu swastika on a wall in India, the original version ofc, kinda weird to see a large swastika on a wall like that
[3:03:16] imainleesin: he said that on broadcast tho?
[3:03:20] David_P00le: If u do it in germany you deffo get a fine if its something like this and if you do more or say Sieg Heil at the same time you can go to prison for a short time
[3:03:26] gliese_58i: or what I associate with the nazis
[3:03:29] fatalqwerty: funny thing about swastika is that I think it meant prosperity or love in sanskrit, totally subverted its meaning
[3:03:34] kerokerogrips: did Gen G follow up on the taiwan business or has it been hush hush after that
[3:03:37] archie7497: @freakoe brother not every statement is meant with full thought in a twitch chat. I don't like what happened so I vented.
[3:03:51] NaCl_3PO: they Stalin‚Äôd him
[3:03:51] Miipaah: @imainleesin no it was a leaked backstage video of him doing the dJ hand move, and he called it the hitler bc it looks like ur hailing
[3:03:56] najafan: @kerokerogrips Hmm? What Taiwan business?
[3:04:00] commando1814: is riv 3 still at riot ?
[3:04:05] gliese_58i: secret nazi Kappa
[3:04:11] fatalqwerty: so who's on the top of the list Kappa

[3:04:23] commando1814: @clyde1500 ahhh gotcha
[3:04:24] Bladetykon: everyone you slightly disagree with is a nazi now
[3:04:25] plasmacastersalesman: quick was to long in germany Kappa
[3:04:34] QuackTheDuck: dude gwen is so fucking broken
[3:04:34] Riqui__: Does that mean quickshot is a good guy or you hang out with a lot of bad guys?
[3:04:38] najafan: @David_P00le Svenskerren. Kappa
[3:04:43] AzureCatalyst: Lol
[3:04:46] archie7497: Doss this fight jesus christ
[3:04:49] Nytrodark: irrelevant whips his ult
[3:04:49] Freakoe: @archie7497 you are talking for yourself, but there are people who will eat your words and live by it. it exists. words are ment to be chosen carefully.
[3:04:55] theancientdreamer: not really, it was mistaken for a roman salute cause of the painting "Oath of the Horatii". But still... it's pretty dumb of a reason
[3:05:02] fatalqwerty: hmmm that's a pretty dark baron pit
[3:05:05] ghosterath: @montecristo that may be true but at least call it out. It was a bad joke and in poor taste.
[3:05:14] r0ulette_: if my boss was riot games and i wanted my job i would not be caught dead saying anything even slightly controversial, much less nazi jokes ‚ò†Ô∏è
[3:05:17] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips I think a social media post had a poster that referred to Taiwan as a country which caused LPL netizens to get madge
[3:05:31] David_P00le: aaaaah Doss the ult whyyyyy
[3:05:34] fatalqwerty: he almost killed varus too
[3:05:35] najafan: @kerokerogrips BASED.
[3:05:39] fljqpy: ooh time to cancel geng
[3:05:42] gliese_58i: @r0ulette_ not easy to be squeaky clean for a decade unless you lobotomize yourself
[3:05:43] plasmacastersalesman: @kerokerogrips that shit is always funny
[3:06:00] fx_fanslowika: kaiser played a decent bard game todayt
[3:06:01] najafan: @kerokerogrips Even better given the elections that just happened.
[3:06:09] QuackTheDuck: if he got a good bard ult that was a wipe right there
[3:06:09] fatalqwerty: i think it was a worth trade tho, could be better
[3:06:10] r0ulette_: @gliese_58i well to be fair if riot games was my boss a lobotomy wouldn't be a bad option
[3:06:16] mv_peter: Bard without the R
[3:06:24] fljqpy: LLULL
[3:06:49] fljqpy: cancel the leaker
[3:06:58] najafan: Monte is a Destiny viewer confirmed
[3:06:59] fatalqwerty: lmao if our group chat gets leaked, everyone's gonna hang LUL
[3:07:07] David_P00le: Its just a random video of a questionable private joke who the fuck cares
[3:07:23] kerokerogrips: the thing about having yourself as a brand is that the separation between the public and private is getting increasingly thin
[3:07:25] fx_fanslowika: it mightve been funny in that particular group
[3:07:28] commando1814: so you'd make more vulgar jokes around dia than on broadcast.... surely not ! /s
[3:07:30] GPAlexander: cancelling people for their tasteless private jokes is one of the dumbest things
[3:07:34] fx_fanslowika: feels wrong to cancel him of something like this
[3:07:35] commando1814: doa
[3:07:36] plasmacastersalesman: no the stick stays inside Kappa
[3:07:41] boked_seeker: most useless thing to worry about when actual problems are happening worldwide
[3:07:44] fljqpy: dox the leaker
[3:07:45] TwiceTSTS: Honestly I hope people just forget about the video and Quickshot is back in Spring
[3:07:47] kingruben7: shut the fuck up you stupid ass motherfuck (Profanity)
[3:08:03] r0ulette_: big brother is watching üòà
[3:08:12] fortant69: i am thankful my ability to make good money isn't dependent on working for other people
[3:08:14] GPAlexander: people act like they wouldnt all be cancelled if their own private conversations were ever leaked.
[3:08:23] Riqui__: or think twice before posting
[3:08:23] fatalqwerty: yeah gotta be suffocating thinking you're always on camera all the time
[3:08:27] JakeJr: Honestly, the LEC "content" is by-far my least favorite to the point where I find most of it very bad and cringey.
[3:08:38] plasmacastersalesman: @JakeJr strong agree
[3:08:45] kerokerogrips: the lcs casters arent really doing anything outside of casting and twitch to expand their media presence
[3:09:01] Nytrodark: yeah its dumb
[3:09:04] Miipaah: @kerokerogrips all of them stream
[3:09:12] najafan: At least, not without everyone involved agreeing
[3:09:14] neilaith: imagine a dystopian world where people have to be in 'full work mode' even in private with your friends and family

[3:09:45] kerokerogrips: @Miipaah I mentioned twitch , idk if they are doing tik toks if they are would love to know
[3:09:47] JakeJr: While I'm firmly out of my 'early adult years', I find the LCS skits a bit more bearable to watch.
[3:10:02] preev0luti0n: people make alot of money sometimes with their stupid prizes
[3:10:03] GPAlexander: i think its only dangerous because social media wokeness is so stupid
[3:10:07] commando1814: thinking of stupid - the cowboys looked stupid as hell
[3:10:15] Miipaah: @kerokerogrips they are salaried individuals, they work and go home after to do what they want
[3:10:22] Miipaah: let them have work life balance
[3:10:35] Miipaah: they are not hamsters on a . screen obligated to be content for u
[3:10:41] fatalqwerty: I think Monte deleted the Cowboys-Packers game from his mind @commando1814 Kappa
[3:10:45] r0ulette_: monte i feel like you would go insane on the lec broadcast ‚ò†Ô∏è their sense of humor isn't what i imagine yours would be

[3:11:12] Miipaah: Didn‚Äôt Larsen sign like a giga long contract ?
[3:11:14] JakeJr: I've had a really hard time enjoying any of the LEC casters in a very long time... perhaps going way back to the final days of DeMan and Joe.
[3:11:14] fljqpy: should just go WWE and be a clown fiesta
[3:11:15] biggerbeefey: Still like the intentionally mispronouncing malrang meme
[3:11:17] commando1814: @fatalqwerty was it the 4th or 6 th td he turned it off
[3:11:17] Nytrodark: rogue is back to be one of the worse teams again
[3:11:18] fljqpy: esports is boring
[3:11:33] Miipaah: I know Eliot‚Äôs has been franchise tagged, but like tbh that means nothing in esports
[3:11:38] fatalqwerty: prob deleted the game from his mind from 2nd Q LUL

[3:12:45] fatalqwerty: it's like Rogue's just letting SK fist them slowly with lube
[3:12:56] PaulyGee: fnatic game from today was just humanoid Azir masterclass
[3:13:01] Clyde1500: and it started out so funny too
[3:13:01] fljqpy: @fatalqwerty if that is true id rather watch the fisting
[3:13:09] r0ulette_: their players aren't even all bad, they just need a go button
[3:13:09] dragev_oj: If Game_Announcer_on_kill doesnt get the rookie award it is so rigged Kappa

[3:20:39] MonteCristo: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw
[3:20:54] archie7497: @montecristo just keep an eye on how hard Noah made this game for fnatic with him running oom
[3:20:54] smithpw: ty
[3:20:55] fatalqwerty: i bet monte just has to PM them to take it down, some people repost vods that aren't accessible
[3:21:19] catast999: hyili gg
[3:21:31] r0ulette_: LOL
[3:21:50] r0ulette_: hopefully they watch this part of the stream
[3:22:13] fatalqwerty: kinda smart for them to go all in lvl 1 coz lucian-nami lane spikes hard at 2, but if they get chunked before then they acnt abuse it when their powerspike comes
[3:22:27] imainleesin: not worth for dnc
[3:22:33] imainleesin: fnc
[3:22:55] gliese_58i: so.. Humanoid and Razork are still playing together
[3:23:09] Clyde1500: like last game was not a banger ResidentSleeper
[3:23:43] fatalqwerty: but what if they love each other KappaPride
[3:23:44] fx_fanslowika: they extended their contracts
[3:23:58] imainleesin: razork prolly super tilted

[3:25:17] Myyeong: its fleet yes
[3:25:24] Fire_elemen6: After all the tech delays this weekend we should just be happy vods exist
[3:25:33] dianstyle: Will LEC be anther year of one team region
[3:25:35] archie7497: Daglas was so disappointing this game. He got 3 kills before lvl 6 and did nothing.
[3:26:29] gliese_58i: 3 kills before 6 eh, I guess it's happening any second then
[3:26:31] archie7497: Why isn't he top getting grubs. He has d-blade and tunneler while poppy has boots and cloth armour. Wtf
[3:27:02] archie7497: @gliese_58i my bad meant 2
[3:27:16] najafan: Winken Blinken and Nod
[3:27:17] gliese_58i: @archie7497 guessed as much when he turned 6 np LUL
[3:27:53] Miipaah: also it can be used to cage people in or Keep them out for peel
[3:27:57] Myyeong: its a less annoying wind wall :D
[3:28:00] Cbaker94: Like Samira W?
[3:28:10] Miipaah: just a well designed abilty
[3:28:46] fatalqwerty: Nilah W is also a well designed ability
[3:29:01] najafan: Gives poppy a ton of versatility in game.

[3:31:24] fljqpy: lol the powerpuff girls he said
[3:31:32] archie7497: Is azif supposed to take plates in his face vs xerath. I don't know the matchup
[3:32:16] imainleesin: humanoid munching plates
[3:32:20] David_P00le: FNC has had 2 quite convincing games, lets see how they do tomorrow
[3:32:27] PaulyGee: Aware
[3:32:28] fljqpy: midlane is strong FeelsStrongMan
[3:32:59] David_P00le: Nah he's normally the reverse Razorcake, he wouldn't suddenly Razorcake us
[3:34:25] imainleesin: wen is lck?
[3:34:30] najafan: 2 days
[3:34:36] archie7497: I'm guessing fleet working on azir soldiers now makes the xerath matchup much better
[3:35:01] najafan: Bring back zzrot I swear.
[3:35:05] imainleesin: the xerath pick useless yep
[3:35:11] najafan: I can be trusted with zzrot.
[3:36:21] David_P00le: Holy Geng T1 on the first day of Lck is the real banger

[3:36:24] PaulyGee: also only 2300 gold
[3:36:48] archie7497: Lmao now give azir red. Is it cuz the soldiers apply the red buff burn
[3:39:21] Esterifikace: but think of all the farm on bot lane vicksySip
[3:39:34] David_P00le: I guess Photon was scared they turn on him but then why are you tp'ing in so early and from that angle
[3:40:29] Fire_elemen6: Maybe they're just bad
[3:40:39] Esterifikace: maybe
[3:40:40] archie7497: If the red side team was a good lpl teams it's insta engage
[3:41:13] UpYerArs: i think its a language barrier difference
[3:41:19] najafan: This is called Science^TM
[3:41:40] draftEst: That's also not how baron blue works
[3:41:40] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[3:41:48] draftEst: Yea needs to respawn
[3:42:44] najafan: We just need to revert jungle to S5 tbh.
[3:42:51] Jose_CR: xerath is briar
[3:42:53] archie7497: I'm pretty sure medic was correct on the first instance. The buff transforms at 20 minute. It doesn't need to spawn after 20
[3:43:26] najafan: Return to S5 jungle, it'll work out, I promise.
[3:43:30] draftEst: No Archie it does
[3:43:39] archie7497: I heard Dom talk about it a few days ago
[3:43:40] TheTraderKing: it neeeds to respawn
[3:43:43] draftEst: He even said on stream he was wrong
[3:44:08] TheTraderKing: they took their own blue buff after 20 minutes in this game
[3:44:13] archie7497: @draftest oh okay. My bad then
[3:44:36] imainleesin: why does varus have amp tome?
[3:44:42] Esterifikace: maybe there is some grace period but I have for sure seen buffs that were alive before minute 20 give the buff to all
[3:44:45] draftEst: No worries it's a weird thing
[3:44:53] Riqui__: @imainleesin rageblade
[3:45:03] Esterifikace: could have been some funky shit tho
[3:45:03] SeaMan2k: You can deny turrets in league now?
[3:45:20] imainleesin: was amp tome alway in rageblade?
[3:45:20] Riqui__: its bad
[3:45:21] PaulyGee: humanoid rabadons MonkaS
[3:45:21] draftEst: It's broke
[3:45:28] lulustarlightt: it awful
[3:45:38] draftEst: Gun and storm surge are going to get nerfed
[3:45:41] Miipaah: I just find it weird Xerath is strapped now
[3:45:42] najafan: I think it's not an inherently bad mechanic? It would cause some interesting strategic decisions about when to take when not to based on game state and cost/benefit.
[3:46:01] imainleesin: wow
[3:46:06] draftEst: Burst mages are going nuts on ladder
[3:46:08] fatalqwerty: watch Ksante 1v9
