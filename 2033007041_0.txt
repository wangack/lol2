[2:49:33] 44kiki_: Salut ! Tu penses quoi de la wardstone ? J'ai l'impression que les stats que Ã§a donne sont trop faibles , est ce qu'en pro on le verra? Pour ces stats, vaut mieux faire un solari...
[2:49:37] JXFullard: bless you
[2:49:39] shadowymisstep: Bless you!
[2:50:09] rulerfromwish: @44kiki_ moonstone?
[2:50:19] 44kiki_: L'item pour poser 2 pinks et 4 wards
[2:50:21] Kelderaith: nah il parle clairement du truc qui peut "hold" des pinks
[2:50:30] Kelderaith: tsÃ© le truc qui a jamais vu de play en genre 2-3 ans
[2:50:37] rulerfromwish: ah okay
[2:50:50] shadowymisstep: Communicating in these lobby seems like hell
[2:50:55] shadowymisstep: *lobbies
[2:51:08] 44kiki_: Ok LUL
[2:51:14] ayalabrennan515: its just its own dialect is all
[2:51:21] JXFullard: !jojo
[2:51:21] Nightbot: No one's getting murdered Jojo's just like that sorry
[2:51:36] Aldermanly: you excited for smolder to be released?
[2:52:23] shadowymisstep: Vulcan how much do you remember from your Comp Sci attempts
[2:52:30] shadowymisstep: Or should I just figure out this coding class on my own
[2:52:46] shadowymisstep: Useless
[2:52:56] JXFullard: lmao
[2:52:58] Kelderaith: un peu curieux de ton opinion phil sur ce dÃ©but de saison. Est-ce que je suis le seul a trouver Ã§a limite injouable niveau balance? le "pas de pre-season" semble avoir causer cela, je trouve Ã§a un peu terrible honnÃªtement
[2:53:07] rulerfromwish: Zyra viable with new items ?
[2:54:14] ayalabrennan515: apa mid too
[2:54:21] shadowymisstep: Where's Asyc when you need him
[2:54:29] shadowymisstep: For anything other than gambling away one's life savings
[2:55:26] rulerfromwish: @Kelderaith feel juste weird pour l'instant wait 2-3 patch avant de solo queue lol
[2:56:30] Kelderaith: on t'inquiÃ¨te I will
[2:56:40] Kelderaith: j'ai jouer une couple de norms pis j'Ã©tais genre "yikes"
[2:57:10] Kelderaith: un des pires dÃ©buts de saisons que j'ai vu perso (j'ai pas jouer toute les saisons depuis beta though to be fair)
[2:57:28] Veokke: haha yall shouldve fist bumped after that
[2:58:11] rulerfromwish: @Kelderaith support gold is mad op tho vraiment facile de get full build lol
[2:58:16] Veokke: so wholesome
[2:58:49] Kelderaith: ah j'en doute pas, cÃ´tÃ© support Ã§a a pas l'air si pire tbh
[2:58:58] Kelderaith: les support items ont l'air overtuned rare en fait lol
[2:59:01] Veokke: @rulerfromwish not that op, just a bit more gold frontloaded for first/midway 2nd item
[2:59:08] Kelderaith: j'ai vu des lanes faire double support items bot pis c'Ã©tait super bon
[2:59:22] Kelderaith: tsÃ©, il faut vraiment que Riot fasse la mÃªme erreur 4-5x de suite I guess
[2:59:49] Veokke: and its still capped to support items, lux players building shjt like ludens gun is dumb when imperial rush much better and gold efficient
[3:00:27] rulerfromwish: @Veokke might be, im spamming zyra rn tho so idk about builds
[3:00:39] Veokke: ooh zyra seeems fun what items r ugetting
[3:01:24] rulerfromwish: @Veokke liandrys and the hextech thingy

[3:18:39] owneurmen: @baiixo i mean he is close to 30 year old so he is working outside of league full time
[3:18:54] shadowymisstep: Do we have an incentive for 100

[3:22:05] shadowymisstep: You people don't know how to negotiate
[3:22:22] canofabyss: incentive could be a really cool math equation
[3:22:34] owneurmen: Vulcan_LoL maybe you can do a sub goal and if you it the sub goal before the end of the slip #1 of 2024 you do 24h stream in the off season like maybe 1k
[3:22:37] JXFullard: I will gift 20 subs RN if you play a Yuumi game

[3:50:20] shadowymisstep: Well, stay positive. Wasn't really the Yuumi's fault, I guess
[3:50:26] SeanLandDGeorge: I feel like this is a really bad game for a Rengar to play into :/
[3:50:44] canofabyss: kinda unlucky yuumi pick for this game. She needs a better hypercarry to hop on

[3:58:15] shadowymisstep: We can't call it wintrade Vulcan, we'll get in trouble
[3:58:25] shadowymisstep: It's called a "subscriber incentive"

[3:58:30] shadowymisstep: I know I'm memein'
[3:59:03] lebronzejayce23: @JXFullard relax u dont need to be apologizing when vulcan made the choice to pick yuumi

[4:03:09] lebronzejayce23: sry whats the first item icon for senna on screen rn?
[4:03:13] shadowymisstep: IT's either inane LCS questions or I start asking philosophy again in the middle of the night
[4:03:57] SeanLandDGeorge: Opportunity seems pretty absurd. As does Malignance
[4:04:28] coin1: hows FLY?
[4:04:34] lebronzejayce23: looks like the upgraded supp item + opportunity makes the first auto rly hurt
[4:04:36] coin1: they are my dark horse
[4:04:40] shadowymisstep: I hope Massu does well
[4:05:08] coin1: ye thought so

[4:06:41] shadowymisstep: Yaaaaaaay
[4:06:45] shadowymisstep: I don't have to talk to people anymore
[4:06:48] MagicNickBall: Did you watch the LEC at all to have an idea of picks?
[4:07:00] lebronzejayce23: lcs on weekends is objectively better but ngl it was way easier to watch on weekdays during work hrs
[4:07:08] coin1: i dont think its possible to know whats good yet
[4:07:11] coin1: with all these changes
[4:07:41] shadowymisstep: @lebronzejayce23 I agree, I honestly found the weekdays better for my schedule for weekends infinitely more accessible
[4:07:52] coin1: i do

[4:08:19] lebronzejayce23: lucian nami looked like the biggest bait in LEC
[4:08:20] shadowymisstep: NGL LCS is my job so I'd like having my weekends back
[4:08:23] shadowymisstep: But whatever
[4:08:37] JXFullard: Yeah, weekends for sure makes it easier on everyone
