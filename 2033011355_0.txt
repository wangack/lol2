[1:23:17] podduhh: @denunciator depends how you want to define it. I‚Äôm not saying it as an insult, I‚Äôm saying it reference to margin of error on conclusion which in biology is inherently suspect due to the wide variability and lack of more definitive answers.
[1:23:20] denunciator: quidlievers Aware
[1:24:05] wilfrLd: That's lame, you can choose your adaptive in instances like this
[1:24:10] denunciator: @podduhh I mean that's at the heart of the replication crisis which, tbh, self inflicted damage given our overemphasis on p values as a means of defining publishability

[3:46:45] SpankersQ: Can you help me itemize for Rakan? I feel like I'm building different things for every game but he seems so diverse with how he plays into comps whether it's for peel or engage
[3:46:49] SpankersQ: @stunt
[3:47:08] czekczek1: yes
[3:47:19] GlacialEmbrace: I wonder why they nerfed lucidity so much

[7:24:04] emperorofwarxxxxx5: as a support i abadon my adc lv 2 and perma roam and i got 74 percent d3 so far do u think it can work far into high elo
[7:24:12] memost1: @snj10111 lmaoo, thanks üòÇ
[7:24:19] ClxmateLoL: blitz
[7:24:21] taibotxd: also what makes a good coach. I feel like elo does not equate good coaching
[7:24:25] Deider4: thresh
[7:24:29] ClxmateLoL: ah banned. rip
[7:24:37] Deider4: thresh 1 trick
[7:24:41] taibotxd: like there is some correlation sure cause of general game knowledge etc but you get the point
[7:24:45] Cariyla: pick bad matchup Learning
[7:25:08] memost1: @clxmatelol thank you!
[7:25:19] acekiritou: @taibotxd i feel like in league of legends it does cause you can climb HARD in league with macro only atleast thats my prespective of the game
[7:25:55] PicaDan: my favorite pro game of yours was 2020 vs TL, you on thresh was clean
[7:25:55] Ghostloon: GAMBA
[7:26:10] Drayssen: @stunt Do you have any stories of something one of your GREAT coaches did/said?
[7:26:39] snj10111: breaking point type stories? xdd
[7:26:53] Drayssen: That's interesting
[7:27:10] taibotxd: @acekiritou I think that being high elo can give you game knowledge but that doesn‚Äôt mean you know how to articulate it well to an audience. I think it‚Äôs the same thing how some professors are extremely smart but can‚Äôt teach well despite that
[7:27:19] best_eboy_na: you should just be your own coach :)
[7:27:21] Ghostloon: don't have to name names
[7:27:21] Cariyla: Learning
[7:27:35] brightdiscord: 0
