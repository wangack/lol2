[0:37:27] yoohntft: gives ap to ap champs and ad to ad champs
[0:37:32] yoohntft: hence "adaptive"
[0:37:33] cquack13: Adaptive force is a stat that grants champions either attack damage or. ability power, depending on the current amount of bonus attack damage and ability power of the champion, as follows: Higher Bonus AD → Attack damage.
[0:37:36] JMSavior: adaptive force is either AD or AP based on how you're buildinhg, so it'll give you AP
[0:37:38] oblivion862: It becomes AP or AD according to the champ
[0:37:42] Syllenia: It gives ap/ad depending on which is higher
[0:37:51] Sunkindled: The greater ad or ap
[0:38:09] maytwer: adaptive force is either ap or ad, depending on what your bonus of that stat is greater
