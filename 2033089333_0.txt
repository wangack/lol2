[2:50:48] akmpe: I haven't tested to see if the movespeed stacks on both of them
[2:50:51] akmpe: not good for teemo either way

[2:57:28] akmpe: And QSS
[2:58:13] T0asTee: i think its valid to say u want to lower cd so u have less pressure to not shroom because of hexplate
[2:58:16] T0asTee: LUL
[2:58:22] akmpe: Malignance has Ultimate haste, but seems useless on AD

[2:59:17] akmpe: No
[2:59:17] T0asTee: you max out at 17
[2:59:20] T0asTee: instead of 18
[2:59:38] akmpe: I feel like it's only useful on RoA users
[3:00:11] T0asTee: approach velocity is just a suggestion but i think pta + ingenious is better tho
[3:00:57] akmpe: Riot needs to bring back Frozen Mallet ipavAngry

[3:08:13] HOPE_Ismail_Abi: love you mr pav <3
[3:08:35] HOPE_Ismail_Abi: no homo KappaPride
[3:08:37] T0asTee: terminus takes like 10 autos to fully stack but its like youre probably half hp by the time you get it full
[3:09:06] akmpe: Yeah I'm wondering who would even build it... It has potential, but seems bad at the moment
[3:09:36] T0asTee: or maybe u stack it faster with guinsoo but youre not starting the fight with full stack ig
[3:10:11] T0asTee: wait why does lucian have support item
[3:10:13] T0asTee: HUH

[3:38:40] Kabrewie: should've given it big titties, agreed NOTED
[3:38:53] TausendSonnen_: i mean, new baron looks also really badass with the hands at the bottom tbh
[3:39:14] TeoAngel95: @ipav999 mr ipaaav why tito is so banned tho ? now you got the revange of being camped and bad things happening on top for last seasson
[3:39:18] kleentz: Unofficial void event
[3:39:34] Kabrewie: @TeoAngel95 because his winrate is insane at the moment
[3:39:46] TeoAngel95: so?

[3:39:58] TeoAngel95: eve shaco are op tho

[3:44:42] TeoAngel95: @ipav999 mister I have to contradict you, because you can't have fun when ur jg let you play single and watching you being pressed by enemy (jg + top) and typing that "xD" in chat... you can go crazy you know?
[3:45:10] Fry_guy0: this man really fearlessly threw out both china AND taiwan

[3:49:18] T0asTee: KEKL
[3:49:20] LtChezo: his base skin fits the theme
[3:49:29] T0asTee: if u put a skin on it its no longer void KEKL
[3:49:37] T0asTee: ig @LtChezo LETHIMCOOK
[3:50:00] LtChezo: ok i'll LETHIMCOOK
[3:50:04] Skimmi: AP Cho with Comet or even HoB can be really strong in lane
[3:50:08] T0asTee: LETHIMCOOK same
[3:50:35] T0asTee: dark star is now void themed LETHIMCOOK
[3:50:53] TeoAngel95: @ipav999 did ya tried the new liandry + heart steel  + new rift maker + grasp comobs?
[3:50:54] yungmoneyhashregister: a trend today huh

[3:50:58] Skimmi: did he say gecko? KEKW
[3:53:07] Synestive: What feels best as a teemo main chat? 5 man shroom, 1 shot guy from invis, kiting entire team etc? what's teemo ultimate gamer moment
[3:54:09] Skimmi: 5 man shroom for me, especially when we still had Liandry Demonic combo
[3:54:39] kiikiiii21: The best feeling is when you delete league and touch grass
[3:54:43] kiikiiii21: Jkk
[3:57:29] KarmicKnight: that ekko's something else
[3:57:46] TausendSonnen_: welp good thing its not ranked right

[4:07:29] TausendSonnen_: Are you not building warmogs anymore?
[4:10:34] erycek1: so what are you building as a last item?
[4:12:09] Bluichu: what is terminus?
[4:12:15] erycek1: new item
[4:13:08] KarmicKnight: magic damage on hit AD item that gives stacking defense and armor pen when you hit
[4:13:24] Bluichu: ah
[4:13:40] terralir: armor+magic % pen
[4:13:46] KarmicKnight: a little like black cleaver but buffs yourself instead of debuffing enemy

[4:20:32] BETO123212: Hello I am sorry if you spoke about it but what you think anout terminus?
[4:20:54] BETO123212: Oh you think its broken
[4:21:00] BETO123212: BebeLa
[4:21:15] jerrykremi: those stacks are permanent?
[4:21:30] BETO123212: From terminus?
[4:21:36] jerrykremi: the lil flames
[4:21:39] BETO123212: No

[4:22:50] eyonixz: yasso adc tho
[4:23:04] Fry_guy0: I thought you guys were doing pretty good until whatever happened
[4:23:22] jerrykremi: the 2/17 ekko could've played a lil better aswell
[4:23:30] KarmicKnight: I think ekko fed 2 kills to xin within the first 3 minutes
[4:24:05] Fry_guy0: you guys had a tower in every lane over them so I chose to believe
[4:24:38] ÏöïÌïòÎ©¥ÎèÑÎÑ§ÏÉÅÎÇ©ÎÖ∏Ïòà: good fx()
[4:24:40] doktordingerdonger: what about titanic
[4:24:42] KarmicKnight: yeah, they only won towers though, not really any team fights or objectives
[4:24:51] doktordingerdonger: works with rageblade
[4:24:52] Fry_guy0: ah
[4:25:12] LtChezo: honestly cleaver isnt a bad option when you are going ad
[4:25:16] KarmicKnight: I think the enemy team got every dragon and 2-3 baron's
[4:26:56] KarmicKnight: Hullbreaker?
[4:27:40] bigbadtroll: the heal on unending dispair is kinda nutty, but i havent tested it ingame yet
[4:27:49] TerranImba87: @ipav999 Dead Man's Plate?
[4:28:17] Skimmi: frozen heart is super cheap now, might be good in some games
[4:31:55] TerranImba87: DMP > Sterak's imo. But then again i'm a scrub.
[4:32:30] Skimmi: against mixed damage Steraks is really good imo
[4:32:47] Skimmi: otherwise DMP or Wits End or something like that
[4:33:44] XxTRPExX: Keep in mind the sterak shield is going down even without getting hit, so its never the full 80% amount
[4:35:46] TerranImba87: @ipav999 why  did you decide to not include Warmog's? I think it's your best tank idea.
[4:36:27] Skimmi: Jak'Sho + Warmogs not good as final items?
[4:37:32] XxTRPExX: What about grasp?
[4:37:48] TerranImba87: Thoughts on Jaksho, warmog, Heartsteel terminus, Kracken, Rageblade @ipav999
[4:38:19] Skimmi: Stormrazor Bard hits different
[4:40:01] XxTRPExX: Stormrazor bard with infernal drake and souls, it aint your builds fault
[4:40:53] Skimmi: I think against a fed AP mage or assassin, every build feels squishy right now, the items are just overtuned
[4:40:58] Skimmi: and Infernal Soul on top
[4:41:08] Skimmi: build itself probably isn't even that squishy
[4:44:12] XxTRPExX: How much dmg you did compared to everyone else?
[4:44:36] TerranImba87: Jaksho, warmog, Heartsteel, terminus, Kracken, Rageblade is the way forward.
[4:46:34] Trollflix: why not building ultimate haste btw?
[4:46:38] lunanoua0007: dualingo time ?
[4:46:54] Trollflix: there is an item that gives ultimate haste
[4:46:59] KarmicKnight: @Trollflix because shrooms do no damage with an AD build
[4:47:11] Trollflix: oh, then play ap build :D
[4:47:28] KarmicKnight: his team had 4 AP, only non-AP champ was yasuo
[4:47:33] Trollflix: possible hybrid?
[4:47:47] Trollflix: cuz if you go hybrid, there are 2 items gives ultimate haste
[4:48:04] LtChezo: no hybrid this season
[4:48:23] XxTRPExX: What about a tank tiamat with grasp?
[4:48:29] Trollflix: @LtChezo guinso is not AP ?
[4:48:53] KarmicKnight: guinsoo is both
[4:50:24] TerranImba87: Jaksho, Botrk, Heartsteel, terminus, Kracken, Rageblade -   Lethal Tempo, Overheal, bloodline ?
[4:51:16] TerranImba87: MODS more practice tool MODS MODS more practice tool MODS more practice tool MODS more practice tool MODS more practice tool
[4:51:33] TerranImba87: @ipav999 botrk instead of warmog
[4:52:11] TerranImba87: 1100 HP and some damage is a decent health pack though...
[4:54:54] KarmicKnight: seems like bard every game
[4:58:31] Darooka_up: I guess he wants to jungle
[4:58:38] KarmicKnight: smite nasus sounds like a crime
