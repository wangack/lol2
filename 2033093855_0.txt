[1:50:00] hughjanus9001: play fiora?
[1:50:02] hughjanus9001: lol
[1:50:06] hughjanus9001: 1 time
[1:51:02] VengfulDark: It looked better then the results showed because you could actually get on their backline and kill them.
[1:51:46] pureiinsanity: duhh your cursed elo
[1:52:18] VengfulDark: My match history is actually looking good considering I'm first timing new champs.
[1:53:11] KountDuku: i mean the first game looked good
[1:53:21] pureiinsanity: you only naf player
[1:53:53] KountDuku: i think morg might actually be decent against naafiri, especially if dogs count for passive
[1:54:28] pureiinsanity: NAfear-y competing with Nilah for least picked new champ
[1:57:05] pureiinsanity: keanic prob really good into eve at least
[1:57:29] pureiinsanity: ye
[1:57:59] pureiinsanity: i mean FON gives like 125 MR so
[1:58:03] pureiinsanity: all MR items are a bit...
[1:58:09] pureiinsanity: LOL
[1:58:26] pureiinsanity: are they playing ADC's with support items?
[1:58:26] vsmilotic: pretty normal for riot 4Head
[1:58:28] Anonymous0726: It's funny AF ngl
[1:58:31] Xposedxd: r1 and 2 play nunu and sara LOL
[1:58:49] Anonymous0726: How consistently bad they are at sup items
[1:58:57] pureiinsanity: the heck
[1:59:03] VengfulDark: I said that Support items were giving me my first item before my laner
[1:59:16] pureiinsanity: i mean its like they slapped dummy nuts broken passive on items you get for free and thought it was a good idea
[1:59:20] BHStimpy: banger build path ☑️ costs half a costco hotdog bun ☑️ galio w passive ☑️ seems fine FeelsOkayMan
[1:59:21] VengfulDark: The gold per 5 is cracked.
[2:00:06] Anonymous0726: Skarner does look good with new items
[2:00:10] Anyoon361: hello 5up just joined
[2:00:11] pureiinsanity: 5gold per 10 seconds
[2:00:15] BHStimpy: the costco hotdog bun is (to my knowledge) my making not to brag or anything
[2:00:18] BHStimpy: my IQ is at least 71
[2:00:27] pureiinsanity: the starting item gives only 3gold per 10 seconds tho
[2:00:48] pureiinsanity: ^
[2:01:13] Xposedxd: 210 at 7 mins
[2:01:22] pureiinsanity: you have to get to the 500g quest for it to give 5gold per 10
[2:01:27] VengfulDark: That's on top of the passive. It's just +600 gold, but I'm getting it by like 9 minutes.
[2:01:42] pureiinsanity: yeah you give your support 500 gold for free
[2:01:42] Anyoon361: voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge voltySadge

[2:02:39] KountDuku: when you have a charge i think
[2:02:43] pureiinsanity: it gives total 1500 gold before its even completed
[2:02:44] BasiilLeafs: LOOOLLLL
[2:02:55] VengfulDark: Yeah any minion. It's relic shield and Frost fang together.
[2:03:01] cameron416: it's insane bc of how efficient it is. 400 gold cost and then it pays itself off, makes way more, and still ends up as a functional item
[2:03:05] BasiilLeafs: no way this guy types this as if szn didn tjust start like 2 dasya go
[2:03:18] cameron416: tbt when we actually had to pay to level our items
[2:03:59] VengfulDark: Oh yeah supports had to pay to get our gold per 10 item
[2:04:10] KountDuku: been a while since ive seen a skarner
[2:04:14] VengfulDark: but they were good items, mostly
[2:05:45] BHStimpy: good night gamer i hope riot blessings strike your queues

[3:15:05] Anonymous0726: Double turtle stance I think
[3:15:17] cameron416: @muppfinman dont think you'd be taking advantage of the sheen enough to make it worth paying
[3:15:52] AidMich: turtle base has some heal but yeah double turtle is a lot of heal off auto attack

[5:11:10] VelvetLeveilleur: my friends told me that singed usually starts the preseasons pretty strong with high winrates and then progressively gets worse throughout the season, is that true? lol
[5:11:10] RinaVX: that stormsurge item is something else
[5:11:47] Callisto3: Are adc currently in a good position?
[5:11:51] VelvetLeveilleur: oh i see, so the winrate spike makes sense then
[5:12:41] VelvetLeveilleur: do people still hate this little girl? whats her name again
[5:12:42] mordinuu: ap adc rn be like
[5:12:43] VelvetLeveilleur: zoe?
[5:13:09] mordinuu: i mean
[5:13:13] mordinuu: teemo
[5:13:26] VelvetLeveilleur: are the yuumi changes part of that? or is yuumi better/more annoying since those changes?
[5:13:33] RinaVX: u better watch out im gonna snipe u soon
[5:13:39] vsmilotic: teemo is menance this meta though
[5:13:40] mordinuu: was nocturen ever most hated?
[5:13:42] VelvetLeveilleur: also sorry for the question spam, i just like to know a lot about this game haha
[5:13:45] VengfulDark: Yuumi disappoints me mostly because I imagine a cat dashing between allies with W spreading heals and damage. Instead she just sits and presses E
[5:13:46] VelvetLeveilleur: but no desire to play it myself
[5:13:48] levijeans_: as a garen otp im so lucky that i counter ksante but he's still so broken

[5:14:40] 9fierce9: what
[5:14:41] VelvetLeveilleur: i remember watching you play samira a lot last season, is she weak now or do you just like other champions better?
[5:14:52] cameron416: the hell
[5:14:58] blythethea: i hope that was troll my gof
[5:15:05] 9fierce9: how do you even get close to omega strikers gameplay wise
[5:15:09] legrandgrand: Zoomers moment
[5:15:39] VengfulDark: Oh I have the game, but I've never opened it.
[5:15:44] BluerBlack: This game looks like watered down dota Kappa
[5:15:56] cameron416: there’s a 100x more things happening how is that watered down 😭
[5:16:14] VelvetLeveilleur: the only champion i'd be interested in would be riven, but i heard she is very difficult to play, especially when you are new
[5:16:24] VengfulDark: Hwei is a bit overtuned, but no one can play him because everyone spams abiltiies
[5:16:46] mordinuu: viego = infinite skill ceiling lmao
[5:17:03] BluerBlack: Have you tried aurelion?

[5:18:14] VelvetLeveilleur: katarina could probably abuse that, i heard she can build everything lol
[5:18:15] VengfulDark: You build the HP mage items, and the overtuned tank items.
[5:18:26] mordinuu: @VelvetLeveilleur heartsteal kat heartsteal akali
[5:18:38] vsmilotic: i mean the item combination u saying
[5:18:59] IAmNot35: why would u go heartsteel on kat and ahri when u can just one shot everyone instead
[5:19:02] IAmNot35: akali*
[5:19:09] pureiinsanity: true jax'shoe vlad sounds dumb
[5:19:27] BluerBlack: Oh true vlad should also be even more op
[5:19:28] VengfulDark: Depends how much CC the enemy has.
[5:19:34] VengfulDark: and what kind of CC.

[5:22:37] biglionv2: if they dont announce plans or changes to tweak this game ill quit after 11 years lol
[5:23:01] BluerBlack: The tank meta is not new
[5:23:22] BluerBlack: I think thats the reason they added hp based damage items early on
[5:23:50] biglionv2: tanks are stronger than theyve ever been
[5:23:54] biglionv2: its not even close
[5:24:03] BluerBlack: nah
[5:24:12] BluerBlack: mundo used to be unkillable with like 2 items

[5:24:43] BluerBlack: may be
[5:24:51] BluerBlack: but its not strongest ever be
[5:25:15] BluerBlack: I remember malph mid times
[5:25:35] biglionv2: malph mid never built tank items
[5:25:48] biglionv2: malph mid was ap glasscannon with zhonya
[5:26:04] BluerBlack: They used to just like mundo
[5:26:40] BluerBlack: then they nerfed them and made him more ap
[5:27:34] BluerBlack: I played this game just after beta tho
