[2:50:07] 6qazi9: wait so that item keeps creating a new damaeg zone around nasus when he ults ?
[2:50:35] Kersantti: Why Teemo keeps standing in e
[2:51:28] schlonk_: how does this item work on nasus? Must they stand in your r field?
[2:51:45] ZeroTheGame: @Kersantti Cuz he's trying to farm. Plus he is slowed with W at the same time
[2:53:06] seichauso: where are the little voidlings from?
[2:53:07] Kersantti: @zerothegame nah hes also just tanking it in many cases. Like moment when he survived with 1hp. Hes not valuing hes hp bar at all, when he has no sustain.
[2:53:18] ZeroTheGame: I usually start banshees veil against a teemo, then go a more typical nasus build after that
[2:55:12] seichauso: but didnt they change bashees to a late game item now?

[2:55:56] ZeroTheGame: ...or read patch notes
[2:56:30] seichauso: ah ok, they gave it more ap (120) and upped the price, good 4th 5th item choice as an ap now
[2:56:48] seichauso: ^but possibly also good earlier, im not that familiar with ap builds
[2:57:28] ZeroTheGame: Ah! well if it's too expensive it's not gonna make a good first item to counter a teemo and the like
[2:58:10] Saephon: Maligma
[2:58:21] ZeroTheGame: But the truth is even just building verdant barrier (if it still exists) usually puts you ahead, without having to build the full banshees

[3:02:35] Kersantti: @zerothegame for me it was niche for tank diana etc to get huge flat 20-25 pene vs squishies.
