[0:00:56] cHiLmAxzU: good morning medic + chat
[0:01:16] hayleeejay: guten morgen
[0:01:33] deTomko: hello chat, i seem to have impecable timing
[0:02:35] lec_airport_speedrun: medicLeaveFinger
[0:02:47] lec_airport_speedrun: I'm off to watch a competent streamer
[0:03:03] GimmMeASammich: TRUE
[0:03:03] lec_airport_speedrun: medicHmm_SG
[0:03:12] hayleeejay: that’s adults in general
[0:03:29] lec_airport_speedrun: What kind of fraud would do that, huh
[0:03:31] effepesse: good morning xdd
[0:03:34] mynci: long weekend huh
[0:04:30] mynci: not bad off to get a B12 jab
[0:04:46] hayleeejay: are you casting today as well?
[0:05:04] cHiLmAxzU: im sorry if im overstepping the mark but you looked like you'd lost some weight on cast yesterday - i think my last point of reference was either lec finals or worlds
[0:05:16] PlzN0: hello people
[0:05:24] Borellun: What do you think about power puff girls for the second pair of grubs, to pair with ed-edd-eddy?
[0:05:24] StaringEemil: been ill for two weeks soon got new antibiotics today Pog
[0:05:29] mynci: oh and all seeing baron isnt prey. we need to know if Baron is Fish, Reptile or mammal
[0:05:35] PhoenixTigerWolf: goat casting as per usual Pog
[0:05:40] PlzN0: its the haircut :)
[0:05:42] Vaelaz: Emoji = picture character... that was an interesting tidbit.
[0:06:16] FlameGoCZ: Heyo
[0:06:17] cHiLmAxzU: yep - acknowledged, i'm sorry
[0:06:18] Cremlindor: At the same time, people need to also have your mindset. That people are just trying to compliment you
[0:07:05] Odyssey1989: Great cast yesterday, loved the feel of the cast, especially the conversation you were fostering with Jamada during Rogue vs Heretics
[0:07:05] meikibuh: insane casts, keep the energy up!
[0:07:07] Odyssey1989: Rational
[0:07:15] hayleeejay: I got complimented most of my life on my “thin arms” and now I’m old and they’re a bit wobbly I get self conscious about them for the same reason
[0:07:16] Odyssey1989: Not all reactions are rtationl
[0:07:40] cHiLmAxzU: makes sense
[0:07:40] Odyssey1989: Anxiety is especially good at causing irrational responses
[0:07:53] lec_airport_speedrun: True, we do all hate you
[0:07:58] meikibuh: imposters syndrome sucks PepeHands
[0:08:53] cHiLmAxzU: nono, i get it!
[0:09:01] cHiLmAxzU: we're all learning
[0:09:26] yacopok: Digging the new haircut. Looks fresh af
[0:09:28] mynci: was there any major surprises for you over the weekend games?
[0:09:31] lec_airport_speedrun: I think you should do a rogue cosplay today
[0:09:41] Odyssey1989: Empathy is hard, especially as I think in our current society, empathy is frowned upon, most people don't value it highly sadly.
[0:09:52] lec_airport_speedrun: No engage, no gameplay, just wade aimlessly towards loss
[0:09:56] PlzN0: was the studio as loud as we imagined? bb said he couldnt even hear his teammates
[0:10:00] meikibuh: KekCorp xdd
[0:10:06] yacopok: Heretics surprised me in a negative way
[0:10:14] dwakndwa: TH vs MDK was a surprise
[0:10:17] yacopok: That loss to MAD was painful
[0:10:18] buraczekninja: are you going to cast today?
[0:10:20] Epsi_long: what is your favorite cheese Medic
[0:10:21] hoogemast: yeah, tho sometimes people are just rude because they dont weight their words before saying them. Like a friend of mine lost a child (4 children, 3 boys one girl) and someone managed to say it was unfortunate that she lost the girl and not one of the boys (since she had 3 boys )
[0:10:21] Yggdrasl: rogue D:
[0:10:25] StaringEemil: SK looks clean
[0:10:31] hoogemast: sorry late on the response
[0:10:32] gruzovik75: @MedicCasts Hey buddy! i ussualy not commenting on your comentary but was lit as always!!! you look so good!! in shape!!!! maybe a bit tired!!! but your rock medic we all cheeering for you with friends!!!!!!!
[0:10:56] yacopok: A doctor's handwriting MonkaS
[0:11:00] jennyyyll: I love how energetic the fans were so far!
[0:11:10] buraczekninja: are you going to cast today? 󠀀
[0:11:22] lec_airport_speedrun: He's not casting today
[0:11:31] lec_airport_speedrun: If anything he's on AD
[0:11:34] Addrek: Struggle to stay awake game 5? KEKW
[0:11:35] buraczekninja: thanks
[0:11:36] 0kkom: Medic I have about 5 minutes before my therapy session starts but I NEEDED to come here to share my thoughts. You've talked a lot about the all seeing baron having side-facing eyes and thus being a prey animal
[0:11:51] mynci: yeah I heard very few boos which was nice
[0:11:51] Epsi_long: Prayge kc fans please dont ruin it
[0:12:01] cHiLmAxzU: i do think LEC is already shaping up well this year, the changes have been good
[0:12:03] gruzovik75: @0kkom HAHA THAT WAS FUN ;d
[0:12:03] yacopok: Wouldn't this be easier to make in a Google Sheet? :D
[0:12:14] StaringEemil: KC vs MAD today could aggressive
[0:12:28] 0kkom: But I think it's more akin to a hammerhead shark, which has very sidefacing eyes giving it nearly 360 degree vision and also above and below it. Thus being more akin to an aquatic apex predator. This is supported by the fact that baron swims into the pit
[0:12:37] Epsi_long: :(
[0:13:07] mynci: @0kkom and crocodiles killer whales sharks
[0:13:10] LUCYXZ1337: bro
[0:13:11] PlzN0: scuffness is great
[0:13:12] Epsi_long: chameleons
[0:13:13] LUCYXZ1337: is fnatic cooking
[0:13:15] LUCYXZ1337: or what
[0:13:20] 0kkom: A lot of aquatic animals do, so I think baron is aquatic
[0:13:21] Vaelaz: Maybe some dinosaurs?
[0:13:34] LUCYXZ1337: i am kinda sad for trymbi
[0:13:35] 0kkom: Anyway, off to healthcare. Have a wonderful stream!
[0:13:40] LUCYXZ1337: dont think jun is better :(
[0:13:57] Borellun: but it would make sense for baron to be prey. It doesn't go hunting, it just sits in its pit, and he know enemies will come to slain him
[0:14:00] mynci: aquatic predators have eyes fuirther to the sides so they can see both up and down
[0:14:19] LUCYXZ1337: i have a suggestion for lol vods
[0:14:24] yacopok: Where you headed?
[0:14:29] Skullywix: I see Graphic design is your passion
[0:14:30] LUCYXZ1337: just get some chall support or something and watch their vod and commentate
[0:14:36] boksy_chan: you write way better than caedrel with his magic pen xdd

[0:15:50] DaveedekW: from what word is "emoji" derived then? Susge @MedicCasts
[0:16:33] DaveedekW: oh, okay okay, thank you!

[0:18:46] raxxman: Hey medic, enjoyed the casting last night, one thing about prey species, it's only really true for mammals, predatory fish, reptiles often have wide field of views :D
[0:18:48] Formanovo: Great casting yesterday. Awesome for LEC to be back!

[0:25:08] remixlol1: To perform
[0:25:14] Scarf1991: don't forget to pick up the goa tea while you're there
[0:25:21] yacopok: Curious of your opinion regarding future game changes. I was thinking lately that future solo laners should be able to play both top or mid. I think that would enable teams to be able to have more aggresive picks
[0:25:24] Addrek: I've been told to go to Goa as I was interested in going to India but I have no idea what I would do there
[0:25:32] TheK10S: Do you get more AP / heal+shield with that item if you have presence of mind active?
[0:25:37] yacopok: top and mid*
[0:26:04] KiccDacc: Holy that skin looks so nice
[0:26:12] Alandus: do people in solo q recognize you often?

[0:27:39] Rojanosa: Biggest positive for FNC was that they all look like they are on the same page
[0:27:49] KiccDacc: Pog

[0:27:53] Vandarian: gamer aphelios

[0:32:48] Scarf1991: the more you knoiw
[0:32:52] yacopok: People still getting used to the new support items I see. Adc's should just take cannon and let you last hit another minion to not risk losing the gold
[0:32:52] Th3Juggl3r: oh. thank you
[0:33:10] Odyssey1989: @Jamada @Jamada could feel you cringe, I really enjoyed your back and forth with Medic yesterday, especially talking about yourselves in the Heretics Rogue game xdd

[0:39:24] raxxman: spear is a bad first item, sundered sky or trinity for Jax

[0:42:42] raxxman: apart from Titanic

[0:43:56] TheK10S: Taric is pretty strong right now too

[0:49:44] dwakndwa: @pepsio I guess something like a yuumi to give absurd ms
[0:49:47] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
