[1:39:13] Ammst4r: True, that trundle skin looks so shitty in a good way lmao
[1:40:20] supercole2001: I like traditional trundle back when he was a trash troll not an ice troll
[1:40:50] Captainfordie: the akali is massive, that is one scary ninja
[1:41:59] Livingmists: sundered sky might be good?

[1:56:28] Boh14: Santorin what food do you miss from the states?
[1:57:24] Quuids: thank you for running ads like that.  Annoying when they pop up during the game
[1:57:51] bilboswagginsq: what's the best jung trio right now?
[1:58:58] AistisSlayer: lillia has to be up there
[1:59:13] DemionDemon: Xin is strong af
[1:59:17] bilboswagginsq: yea with the new map its hard to gank
[1:59:25] bilboswagginsq: bilboswagginsq subscribed with Prime. 
[1:59:27] Gameboy736: Nunu has strong ganks but falls off after early game
[1:59:34] rinseandretreat: i was so hungover this weekend, is alcohol regulated in competitive play?
[1:59:40] Dntspeedup: Dntspeedup subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! no more adge for me santorinHey
[1:59:48] Post_Maclone: yeah watching all the shaco homies, it looks pretty doomed for the gank-heavy assassins
[1:59:50] Gameboy736: Brand is strong also
[1:59:51] Quuids: by the way, great name @bilboswagginsq
[2:00:26] Gameboy736: yoo that's cool Pog

[2:00:39] bilboswagginsq: @Quuids ty mate
[2:00:53] Dntspeedup: yesssirrr first challenger vibes
[2:01:41] mkramer2000: That's a good one. I'm not much for drinking, but when I do I tend to go over board lol
[2:01:41] Dntspeedup: LUL LUL
[2:01:48] DemionDemon: so you were 1 year sober in DIG? XD
[2:02:00] Boh14: bring back blitz jungle
[2:02:31] Gameboy736: just remembered Ezreal mid with smite and runic echoes LuL
[2:02:45] Gameboy736: blitz jungle reminded me of that for some reason
[2:02:47] getsometalentloser: it’s funny seeing ppl still trying to coin flip jungle and end up massively behind
[2:02:53] mkramer2000: Yeah I drink maybe once every other month
[2:03:05] bilboswagginsq: drink only quality premium and responsably
[2:03:18] Gameboy736: I drank like 5 times last year, got drunk twice maybe
[2:03:24] bilboswagginsq: gets worse with age
[2:03:40] Quuids: I drink too much.  taking the month of January off though
[2:04:02] bilboswagginsq: yea, it's venom for the stomach
[2:04:21] mkramer2000: Also I don't smoke. Smoking makes me very sick
[2:04:45] Gameboy736: my stomach also doesn't agree with alcohol, most of the time I get sick and have to stop before I actually get drunk, otherwise I just throw up (depends on specific alcohol)
[2:04:45] Ammst4r: My biggest addiction is chips
[2:04:51] Ammst4r: Cant go a week without it
[2:05:03] madgym02: yeah I use to eat lots of sugary sweets and now I’m only eating dark chocolate
[2:05:06] Ammst4r: So good and so unhealthy lmao
[2:05:27] Quuids: I guess I don’t drink that much, I haven’t thought about it at all in January.  I mostly have to drink for work events..
[2:05:37] ch3m15try: :o
[2:05:44] ch3m15try: no burgers?!?
[2:05:47] mkramer2000: Damn that sucks. I put garlic and onion in everything lol
[2:06:11] 30ZentimeterPeter: I went from eating meat daily, drinking & Smoking weed, to vegan straight edge over night, so everything is possible
[2:06:11] milkweed_love: social drinking only. maybe like once a couple months cuz i'm not all that social anyways lol
[2:06:13] oulieman: @ammst4r its fine if you dont eat that much, whenever I eat chips i just get a handful of pringles to scratch the itch. cause the first 10 chips are so much better than the last 10 if u get what i mean
[2:06:29] Gameboy736: I used to be able to drink a lot, mixed alcohol like it's nothing but recently it's been trash LuL
[2:06:51] getsometalentloser: we woo Rengar
[2:06:58] mkramer2000: So does that include garlic powder and onion powder I'm assuming?
[2:06:59] Gameboy736: don't miss alcohol at all, have a little once a few months when I'm out with people, no biggie
[2:07:00] getsometalentloser: @santorin  rumble is bonkers op
[2:07:24] DemionDemon: so i know this might sound like a folk remedy but if you eat something buttery before drinking or eating spicy stuff, you wont feel sick.
[2:08:14] Gameboy736: fatty foods definitely work for alcohol, always have a kebab so my stomach doesn't start rebelling
[2:08:15] ctrl_tones: i cant ease up, one biscuit and the packet is finished
[2:08:27] Ammst4r: @oulieman I feel ya, but for me, its not that I am eating everyday y'know maybe 1 or 2 a week, but when I start i cant stop lmao
[2:08:31] getsometalentloser: riot nerfed teemo@before rumble and akali
[2:08:35] getsometalentloser: this is the world we live in
[2:09:31] mkramer2000: Yeah I get that
[2:09:42] Ammst4r: What kind of condition do you have, if you dont my asking?
[2:10:00] ch3m15try: same herre
[2:10:09] mkramer2000: One of my friends is allergic to red meat and she loves burgers and stuff so that was hard on her
[2:10:12] getsometalentloser: gerds?
[2:10:18] getsometalentloser: I have it
[2:10:36] mkramer2000: Heart burn
[2:10:38] getsometalentloser: its not great espically when it gets really bad feels like your having a heart attack
[2:10:56] Quuids: I’m sorry dude, that sounds rough
[2:11:05] Ammst4r: Uhh I feel you, my gf has very sensitive stomach too, its not easy
[2:11:14] 30ZentimeterPeter: Lactose intolerant?
[2:11:21] Post_Maclone: i had to give up alcohol to get off the heartburn medication they put me on too.  helped a lot. No more meds!
[2:12:35] mkramer2000: Man garen is not the move this season I feel
[2:12:43] stifferne: Garen gameplay
[2:12:48] Gameboy736: he'll fall off, you are a tank and have Garen and Karma, he won't be able to kill anyone
[2:13:32] King_Turnethin: is it ibs?
[2:14:28] kardanlm: jg role Classic

[2:24:44] Gameboy736: @BrazilReignsSupreme check out SortedFood on youtube, they have a french onion soup recipe and it doesn't take 14 hours there, it's a good food channel
[2:24:58] stifferne: @ctrl_tones hmm looked like less to me that time
[2:25:22] mkramer2000: @brazilreignssupreme that's about it lol. There's some beefy flavor to it too but onion hint of beef and cheese
[2:27:23] ctrl_tones: sejugaming
[2:27:36] mkramer2000: Omg it's almost like when your team fights they win lol
[2:27:39] BrazilReignsSupreme: One day ill go to france and taste it lol but i will also try to cook it
[2:28:17] mkramer2000: @brazilreignssupreme that's fair
[2:28:55] BrazilReignsSupreme: I just dont understand the logic behind letting a stew sit for 12 hours on low flamr
[2:29:10] Gameboy736: [Party] :tf:
[2:29:12] stifferne: People think that tanks are only engage tools, when they just as often should be used for peeling
[2:29:24] King_Turnethin: baron - who needs it
[2:29:51] Gameboy736: catJAM
[2:30:27] mkramer2000: @brazilreignssupreme it helps bring out some flavors and slow cooking is very common for certain things. But I agree. If you look online most of the recipes take an hour or two

[3:41:22] Demnar: Grub aggro is very weird
[3:41:40] vestergaard20: new meta, take grubs to top
[3:42:56] Demnar: They should just give each grub its own aggro
[3:42:57] vestergaard20: it should be like wolfs and such were they have their own aggro range

[3:55:44] Nyanra: just get better 4Head
[3:57:14] Boh14: KEKW
[3:57:30] HalcyonDays: Ill never forget the craber incident when reddit and twitter were flaming him and other pro junglers were like "yep Ive done that befre it happens"
[3:57:33] solidussovis: the only reason there is pro League play is for RIOT to build more popularity for the game. If pros are not out there on socials the league suffers in ratings
[3:58:22] vileb123: sometimes the intrusive thoughts win

[5:34:10] iiNumb3rz: He is ad
[5:34:22] tugwos: yes, that's why he picked it
[5:34:26] solidussovis: Shows what I know. I just thought Ramus counters every AA champ
[5:34:35] tugwos: trundle ult counters rammus
[5:34:43] iiNumb3rz: Well trundle r is broken anyways

[5:37:31] iiNumb3rz: I mean picking ww seems troll past like silver elo
[5:37:32] walmartimport: Thanks for linking Lathyrus stream he kindly explained Bard ult interacts only with towers but not with The Shelly a champion inside it.

[5:50:55] iiNumb3rz: See in NA people just drink beer underage and drive without a license. That's the meta.
[5:50:58] polllute: are you going to get a hair transplant? @Santorin
[5:51:10] walmartimport: Meanwhile drive in NA at 16 some states and buy alco at 21
