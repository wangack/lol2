[2:11:57] UnplayableTrash: next is titanic
[2:12:20] UnplayableTrash: titanic and then force of nature
[2:12:31] UnplayableTrash: and then hullbreaker if it ends up being that kinda game
[2:12:35] Lawrence_GGs: I see most sett players go stridebreaker, I dont like it tho at all
[2:13:04] UnplayableTrash: with 6 grubbies why not hullbreaker
[2:13:28] Lawrence_GGs: the twoer dmg is enough as it is
[2:13:32] Lawrence_GGs: hull would be overkill
[2:13:36] copilusevigii: Not even close
[2:13:43] Lawrence_GGs: + it doesnt give you the resistances anymore
[2:13:46] UnplayableTrash: @Lawrence_GGs you right
[2:14:54] VelocityTJ: Yeah they modified hull a ton
[2:15:15] VelocityTJ: Cause it was so broken last season people couldn't even send 3 people for a fed top with it
[2:15:19] Lawrence_GGs: yeah I think now you either opt out to splitpush 24/7 or teamfight
[2:15:24] Lawrence_GGs: you dont get to do both anymore
[2:15:36] Lawrence_GGs: so mostly splitpushers will use this item
[2:15:39] Lawrence_GGs: yorick etc
[2:15:59] amiro2000: when  die hull still working

[3:11:54] thanahtos: @erumokaito no hes not he has a 42% wr in high elo compared to other champs
[3:12:23] erumokaito: so your basing it off on just some winrate percentage and not your own gameplay skill?
[3:12:41] erumokaito: look at auto, still playing sett
[3:12:52] tezi777: did they buff zed? im getting one shotted AS A JUGGERNAUT
[3:12:58] ravenelll: It's riots fault if I lost the light to the biceps KEKW
[3:13:03] thanahtos: @erumokaito no he just feels bad to use this patch very simple
[3:13:11] ravenelll: @tezi777 they buffed him and his items
[3:13:45] xeon77x: i mean winrate % in high elo, especially with as many games analyzed as possbile, do give you a good guess on how a champ is doing
[3:14:22] xeon77x: @erumokaito negative winrate high elo does not have to mean that you cant win more games than others, it just show that most ppl seem to struggle with sett
[3:15:17] thanahtos: wr means a lot even at the beginning of season it just says a lot about how bad sett is even tho i love the character
[3:15:20] ravenelll: I'm more pissed by the fact that they hotfix buffed champions who winrate was around 49% but completely skipped sett, who has a 47% wr in plat
[3:16:18] ravenelll: The music is starting to act weird again
[3:16:42] thanahtos: i agree i honestly think sett needs buffs
[3:16:57] YEhanButterfingErs75: THEY NERF TITANIC HYDRAAAAAA
