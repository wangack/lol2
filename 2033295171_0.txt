[0:48:37] mrshibasan: Sera support
[0:48:45] ObsceneSanity: support has priority fill at the moment
[0:48:46] watermeelon_juice: I thought support is like broken
[0:48:48] Nikodermos: 1 thing that never changes , roit likes f;g its playerbase

[0:49:51] Smoothcollie: At this point it seems like it doesn't matter what u put secondary
[0:49:51] xBoomShotBaby: mid/top
[0:49:55] ObsceneSanity: mid/top will probably be y our best chance for mid
[0:50:22] ObsceneSanity: your champ pool can transition to top most of the time though so it works out
[0:50:24] xBoomShotBaby: too many midlane players
[0:50:26] Nikodermos: mid top and then just viktor top /?
[0:50:27] omae_wo_kuu: Yeah for me it says jungle and bot are needed so I never put those in my roles cause it'll automatically put me as one of those instead of mid
[0:50:27] corsella: frejlord team

[0:50:32] sajmonstepien: We need your morde back
[0:50:48] Nikodermos: ^
[0:50:51] Bogdicool: I guess Mid/Top since they are both solo lanes and the other guy maybe inclined to switch
[0:50:58] xBoomShotBaby: botlane is fun kaypCreep
[0:50:59] Nikodermos: yeah u did crush it on morder the other day
[0:51:03] Smoothcollie: The best solution is to not have autofill, yet we still cannot decide if we wanna wait more and not have autofill or to wait less and have autofill. Like tf rito? Is that so hard to make?
[0:51:28] sajmonstepien: Are we doin any predictions?
[0:51:36] irritatedunicorn: League resets my mouse every game -_-

[2:35:13] som963: Luden is bait
[2:35:27] champrath: Ludens is bad
[2:35:28] ObsceneSanity: ludens needs a massive buff
[2:35:34] IAmKat95: rip ludens ):
[2:35:36] ImaStealYoGurl: tyty
[2:35:37] inSINwetrust: cough cough, yup. Totally sick kaypTroll  @lewhitehd69
[2:35:40] jinxguy10000: luden's is now the tris E I think
[2:35:45] Kowdbuff: played xerath mid once last night, ludens did feel very underwhelming
[2:36:02] mKingEagle: mKingEagle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! love your shirt
[2:36:12] kendren25: ludens was always my first item on Vel Koz
[2:36:15] kendren25: :(
[2:36:29] Darkcyter: @mKingEagle WB
[2:36:50] champrath: Ludens just does very little without its old pen and low ap for its gold
[2:36:58] ballzagna1: no running allowed
[2:37:03] kendren25: You stole a Rengar kill! Sadge
[2:37:33] iamtonin: anyone else have off today cuz of MLK?
[2:37:38] sovitiaisavampire: @kendren25 rigging the prediction
[2:37:43] Kowdbuff: on xerath i think id prefer horizon focus first maybe, then stormsurge? stormsurge first seems eh since his burst isnt great without items
[2:37:51] kendren25: @sovitiaisavampire Obv
[2:38:02] kendren25: @iamtonin Nope, but I do for a snowstorm! :D
[2:38:48] HAYB3AR: @kendren25 same lol
[2:39:16] Darkcyter: @HAYB3AR kaypHello
[2:39:19] NoCapMacc: Ahri winrate is kinda cheeks. does she feel weak rn?
[2:39:27] S17Master: Holy
[2:39:34] Darkcyter: kaypWHAT
[2:39:35] HAYB3AR: cait feels so good adc rn
[2:39:36] Darkcyter: wtf damage was that
[2:39:39] guiltyprawn: The Lucian crit monkaH
[2:39:42] BasedEGOR: RAJOT
[2:39:44] HAYB3AR: @NoCapMacc kaypHello
[2:39:45] moonshadow757: @KayPea oh she doesnt even have stormsurge! LOLL IT GETS SO MUCH WORSE
[2:39:48] ObsceneSanity: -__- I see zed is back on my fucking perma ban
[2:39:53] ballzagna1: this game will never be balanced
[2:39:59] Sherax4: mictiAim mictiAim mictiAim mictiAim
[2:40:03] Kowdbuff: diana mid is pretty disgusting damage lol
[2:40:05] Void_InsideMe: @ObsceneSanity Zed is now sadly worst assasin
[2:40:11] NoCapMacc: good to know Katarina is still broken
[2:40:21] guiltyprawn: Well, Katarina gets more value from on-hit items than actual on-hit users like Kayle or Kog. Because Rito
[2:40:26] moonshadow757: as a 2mil diana 1trick i can attest to that she is DISGUSTING with the new items
[2:40:26] AVerySeriousBoy: I Ban Sylas every game now.
[2:40:29] champrath: Diana feels like old Diana before her brusier rwork
[2:40:32] ObsceneSanity: @Void_InsideMe they over buffed him in the last patch. his 100% ad ult is tooo much
[2:40:32] BabaaBear17: her jump range needs to nerfed I think it’s way to forgiving for her
[2:40:42] reginaphalange00: @guiltyprawn LUL
[2:40:43] Void_InsideMe: @ObsceneSanity not up yet
[2:40:51] chalender21: Isnt the range disadvantage enough to compensate?
[2:40:51] ragtimediddly: are we back to a time like when Akali would get Chemtank top and then do a billion damage but also never die?
[2:40:57] Ryscha: does jayce count as melee or range then though as exception
[2:40:59] Rikimaru114: You still like Eu @KayPea ?
[2:41:01] cosmics_g: how does Ahri feel this season? @kaypea
[2:41:13] wolterbrm2021: to be fair if it is a immobile assasin melee than its ok but since every assassin has 30 dashes it doesnt make sense
[2:41:30] sabiirox: @void_insideme he got buffed recently, from 65% ad on hes ult to 100% ad so hes pretty good rn
[2:41:39] Azmod3ous: @Ryscha He counts as both depending on his stance
[2:41:57] Kowdbuff: your team comp wouldve been pretty good with an enage tanky support, shaco is not it
[2:42:25] Azmod3ous: @Kowdbuff Gragas coulda gone more tank tbh.
[2:42:27] kingdomofblue: gragas could have built bruiser because your team already has dmg
[2:42:27] yewooharmony: yewooharmony subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:42:30] ObsceneSanity: @Void_InsideMe it was part of the hotfix
[2:42:45] Void_InsideMe: @ObsceneSanity well still 45% winrate is tragic
[2:42:51] kates_magates: my heart has a special place for arcade ahri
[2:43:12] S17Master: The failed mute all LuL Classic
[2:43:59] ragtimediddly: cumback is real
[2:44:07] BabaaBear17: I fear fracas will go rank item now and be in killable
[2:44:12] ragtimediddly: ...err
[2:44:14] kendren25: oy
[2:44:19] twinkerbell_xo: not even a second what
[2:44:19] pusheencatt1: not even a second :o

[2:44:58] champrath: Ap/Item are busted Mana/Ap items are really bad
[2:45:03] champrath: exception of Seraphs
[2:45:13] ElminstersGhost: Oh the whole game is busted in 14.1
[2:45:14] xninina: <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[2:45:19] Me1kMan: crazy
[2:45:20] sovitiaisavampire: snowball from behind sounds like a porn term tbh
[2:45:21] champrath: Ap/Hp items are what they buy and they are busted
[2:45:25] Kowdbuff: went 1/4 as diana mid in lane b/c alistar was constantly ganking, ended 6/4 lol, yep
[2:45:37] kendren25: @sovitiaisavampire Hey now, family stream! LUL
[2:45:55] ForbiddenDakota: @sovitiaisavampire LMFAO?????
[2:46:18] Kowdbuff: stormsurge  + lichbane is just 100-0 an any ap champ
[2:46:40] kendren25: yes
[2:46:48] Whiteminas_tirith: Katarina always op
[2:46:49] tomugii: like, i hate sylas sm because of that
[2:47:01] ForbiddenDakota: bullshit items mayhaps?
[2:47:02] OsvaBoian: Annoying af items
[2:47:03] reginaphalange00: i mean katarina can have 0 ap but still one shot xD
[2:47:07] Ryscha: Melee bruiser items for sure
[2:47:12] AVerySeriousBoy: Mages can totally us the AP Assassin items.
[2:47:20] sovitiaisavampire: black cleaver 2.0
[2:47:23] sovitiaisavampire: if you know you know
[2:47:31] damndani_: Kat has always built those ap items though no?
[2:47:48] Me1kMan: kek
[2:47:51] IamTheBreadGuy: Did you try Victor with the new lichbane already? Its pretty good!
[2:47:54] sovitiaisavampire: OOF
[2:47:55] OsvaBoian: Lol nice
[2:47:55] S17Master: No one saw that
[2:47:56] kendren25: Errybody loved the 6 Black Cleaver meta
[2:48:03] sovitiaisavampire: chat, clip that Keepo
[2:48:30] Kowdbuff: lichbane is absolutely busted
[2:48:38] KinKaray: Have you tried Malphite with the new AP Items!?!?!? LUL
[2:48:43] Terhadalas: hey kels! kaypCheer kaypCheer
[2:48:55] twinkerbell_xo: not her flashing over the wall lmaooo
[2:49:10] sovitiaisavampire: @KinKaray seems pretty strong, you could say its a "solid" champ Keepo
[2:49:23] ragtimediddly: I think it would be nice if Riot could actually do something different with their items that isn't just 'Stat buff/debuff' or 'ridiculous on-hit effect'
[2:49:27] AVerySeriousBoy: storm surge, shadowflame and lichbane combined are strong as hell.
[2:49:36] MrsBeebles: Hello KP and chat! <3 Happy Monday everyone
[2:49:46] Whiteminas_tirith: what's difference between old linch
[2:49:46] chalender21: I still build utility and raw AP on sera and still outscales a fed Taliyah. The new items are not that broken imho
[2:50:03] darkstarr222: yeah can we skip? xD
[2:50:05] Niomah: Pops in for a few minutes. Just got back from my elderly lab's semi-annual glucose test and blood panel. She's a weirdo who loves going to the vet.
[2:50:05] KinKaray: @sovitiaisavampire Could be called a "Rock Solid" champion! kaypFreya
[2:50:12] kendren25: Graggy Daddy!
[2:50:13] twinkerbell_xo: BOMBA
[2:50:22] S17Master: Gragas undercover jungler
[2:50:24] darkstarr222: mord ult for style points
[2:50:48] ragtimediddly: throws and counter-throws
[2:50:57] MrsBeebles: I feel like I've seen so many Shaco supports and I don't think I've seen a single one do well :x
[2:51:05] S17Master: Tower?????????
[2:51:06] Yvernaa: Stormsurge is so strong
[2:51:23] darkstarr222: league of oneshots
[2:51:28] darkstarr222: and cc
[2:51:31] Whiteminas_tirith: omg she almost kill his too
[2:51:42] lewhitehd69: Singing
[2:51:56] Kowdbuff: @MrsBeebles so many people who get autofllled to support just play what they wouldve in their normal lane and add on a support item, i hate it as an adc
[2:52:09] kaithegemini: has anivia been buffed? swear her q is faster
[2:52:24] xBoomShotBaby: nice
[2:52:33] moonshadow757: ezreal feels like kleptomancy ezreal
[2:52:48] som963: Malp with stormsurge is so strong it's absurd

[2:54:24] Knivhugg: Yeah I got my logitech setup
[2:54:29] kendren25: !eu
[2:54:29] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[2:54:40] Yvernaa: @kendren25 Ahhh thanks
[2:54:40] ierbuta: Insta kill...
[2:54:42] OsvaBoian: I have no hands, but with a roccat mouse i played 50xcent better. Itworks!
[2:54:43] moonshadow757: 1.1s 2k damage LOL
[2:55:14] kendren25: I think it sounds right
[2:55:14] darkstarr222: i feel like grievous wounds should reduce shielding too. Like not by the same rate as healing but shields seems so damn op =[
[2:55:17] Whiteminas_tirith: 1 sec, wow it's too long to fight
[2:55:28] let_james_play: dang just realised im far to tough on myself with this game, because i played in 2022 for the first time i feel like i should be better than i am, but ive actually in that time only played 438 ranked games
[2:55:33] Knivhugg: Denmark is kinda tough with their visa yea
[2:55:41] CynicalScrub: @KayPea instead of snowball from behind, how about "erase a disadvantage" or something?
[2:55:42] ierbuta: Zhonia
[2:55:46] Yvernaa: They should revert the katarina buff that they added recently I feel like, her passive deals so much at lvl 16, 100% AP ratio...
[2:55:52] inadream_state: how is s14 treating u ?
[2:55:57] markmelee: Hello there kaypLove
[2:56:01] darkstarr222: like why do the same items increase heals and shields.. but seperate items reduce them?
[2:56:09] GoodGamerCharles: Wouldn't it make more sense for melee champs to do 100% and ranged champs to do 75% because melee doesn't have the ranged advantage?
[2:56:20] Ashura__Oni: Good day KP
[2:56:34] S17Master: @GoodGamerCharles If melee didn't have move speed and 89836948634 dash advantage, sure
[2:56:51] S17Master: And higher stats everywhere else
[2:56:59] markmelee: @KayPea Just a question. Is Lucas still playing professional? Haven't been in the scene for a long tiem.
[2:57:15] Whiteminas_tirith: it doesn't matter how many hp or resist, if Katarina feed
[2:57:26] Teekwan: Happy start of the week you beautiful people! How are you? :D
[2:57:41] Trishia_Schwartz: I am so glad to see you're still streaming! My internet went out due to the cold and they just got it back up :)
[2:57:43] Necrothia: 0/7/29 Leona support :D
[2:58:01] Necrothia: How have Kay's games been today?
[2:58:05] OsvaBoian: @markmelee ask lucas, hes online rn
[2:58:19] Azmod3ous: @markmelee He's streaming rn Santorin is his twitch.
[2:58:21] Yvernaa: Luden's and Shadowflame were reworded nicely but adding an item like Stormsurge wasn't a smart decision from riot
[2:58:26] lewhitehd69: @clownylife what are you waffling about
[2:58:27] Yvernaa: reworked*
[2:58:34] lewhitehd69: AINTNOWAY
[2:58:53] GoodGamerCharles: def a clown
[2:58:54] S17Master: Dude's user name checks out LuL
[2:58:57] lewhitehd69: holy that charm dmg
[2:59:01] Whiteminas_tirith: wtf
[2:59:10] markmelee: @lewhitehd69 Hola
[2:59:11] kendren25: Jebaited
[2:59:12] J0LLYR0GER: @KayPea First time being able to tune in since the new season. New season changes feel good IMO. You liking it?
[2:59:20] lewhitehd69: @markmelee sorry i dont speak german Sadge
[2:59:37] markmelee: @lewhitehd69 ok have fun you fuck Kappa
[2:59:44] J0LLYR0GER: With one obvious exception being how giga broken stormsurge is LOL
[2:59:48] lewhitehd69: @markmelee ratirlKiss no you
[2:59:49] Jaak3y: any thoughts on mf and samira this patch? plink
[2:59:57] lewhitehd69: plink
[3:00:18] kendren25: Believers lose :(
[3:00:31] k0t10n: huh
[3:00:40] k0t10n: KEKW
[3:00:40] akanelii: he’s french thats why
[3:00:41] Me1kMan: LUL
[3:00:42] xBoomShotBaby: whaaat
[3:00:43] k0t10n: what a scumfacer
[3:00:46] k0t10n: face*
[3:00:50] moonshadow757: the tag is still the same
[3:01:00] xBoomShotBaby: kaypLOL
[3:01:02] Me1kMan: weird
[3:01:18] cotaz67: but he left the lobby as his old name
[3:01:21] markmelee: @KayPea Sakom and Fog both left the lobby so can't be the same person :(
[3:01:30] Gar116: What a weird hoop to jump through, just to be toxic lol
[3:01:31] Angelyc: ahri is D tier for a reason
[3:01:32] Whiteminas_tirith: omg
[3:01:32] scaperu: i didnt even know you could do that
[3:01:37] xBoomShotBaby: Ez was good

[3:01:43] Angelyc: which feels shit mannn
[3:01:46] J0LLYR0GER: Fog is a different person according to u.gg
[3:01:58] cotaz67: league has been glitching
[3:01:59] MourvinMad: maybe a spectator?
[3:02:04] karamelsaus580: maybe someone in his party idk
[3:02:11] markmelee: Its an imposter PogChamp We found him
[3:02:11] cotaz67: been seeing pre game stuff in after game lobbies
[3:02:11] Azmod3ous: Just look him up
[3:02:14] Kowdbuff: is it keeping the memory on previous lobbies?
[3:02:15] LordEmillo: there were some obligatory (?) name changes recently, maybe some lag that som1 changed name and shows his old one on the coreboard but new in the chat
[3:02:17] if0rg0t2remember: Fog shows up as Zaddy I think
[3:02:19] Azmod3ous: in profile search rn
[3:02:28] J0LLYR0GER: I think its bugged there was also a chat log " null has left lobby" Just about that fog dudes message
[3:02:37] IamTheBreadGuy: Is it a chat from a previous game?
[3:02:38] xBoomShotBaby: probably someone else renamed themselves
[3:03:32] Kowdbuff: on op.gg it says "prev. Fog" so mustve been his old name
[3:03:32] damndani_: Didn’t they already nerf them?
[3:03:47] Kowdbuff: on the rengar
[3:03:56] Sunnytinker: yeah it is a rename if you look them up in op.gg it has Zaddy prev. Fog
[3:03:59] Trishia_Schwartz: if you look up their name you could see if they were in your last lobby
[3:04:00] k0t10n: they are
[3:04:07] k0t10n: Madge peepoRiot
[3:04:12] Jaak3y: *looks at ad mejais that doesnt lose stacks*
[3:04:13] mrry2k: riot is scared of making melee champs weak so they make them op as fuck
[3:04:28] Azmod3ous: @Kowdbuff Yeah I just looked up the FOG name and it brought up his profile on OP lol\
[3:04:39] ObsceneSanity: @jaake3 hubris?
[3:04:44] Jaak3y: @jaake3 yeahhh
[3:04:52] ragtimediddly: yeah nah, giving them more damage at base is lazy balancing
[3:04:57] moonshadow757: OMG malginance is SO STUPID!!! when i diana ult with that item its insane
[3:05:10] kates_magates: we could totally twin one day if we didn't live on opposite sides of world because i have that shirt!
[3:05:16] damndani_: The ranged champs just need to consider spacing etc surely
[3:05:22] Trishia_Schwartz: at this point they 1v9 all game
[3:05:24] damndani_: Or idk
[3:05:34] IamTheBreadGuy: And they are a lot more mobile in general as well.
[3:05:43] Galetea: ive seen too many morde raid bosses in my games
[3:06:11] damndani_: They aren’t mage items though… they are AP items no?
[3:06:15] Trishia_Schwartz: they don't even have to play well or safe. Just wait it out and they'll outscale
[3:06:16] sabiirox: You should try Diana shes op atm
[3:06:22] Azmod3ous: You mean like they already od for bruiser items? (Full stats for melee nerfed for ranged) That would be crazy lol.
[3:06:33] Azmod3ous: do*
[3:06:43] let_james_play: tbf i think all dmg needs to go, i wathced a lebanc last night nuke a champ from full to dead in less than a second, not sure how thats fun to play against
[3:06:45] chalender21: @kaypea I think we have bigger fish to fry. Bruisers building tanks or assasins building 1 tank item is way more unbalanced LUL
[3:07:10] Teekwan: There should always be a risk and reward when playing those champions, like you go in a fight thinking what you could lose or win, but nowdays melee champs just go in knowing that they will win @kaypea
[3:07:16] if0rg0t2remember: @let_james_play that is kinda LeBlancs M.O. though. She's a slipper glass cannon. Either she throws or she one shots
[3:07:16] moonshadow757: i feel this pre season should've lasted a lot longer. The game went from a tad bit balanced to just pure chaso @KayPea
[3:07:19] ballzagna1: this game will never be balanced, the devs will never care about our complaints cause they make enough money as is
[3:07:39] HolyhardOfficial: how can someone marry u god i  am watching u like 4 more years now and i never stopped be so happy
[3:07:44] Infernolol69: if ap  items  are  broken its  broken for  both meele and  ranged btw
[3:07:45] Azmod3ous: I've watched Riot August's stream and he basically states ppl just need to accept things they way they are stop crying lol
[3:07:48] Whiteminas_tirith: but they don't like ranged mage mid lane so many people play more effortless mele champ
[3:07:56] let_james_play: @if0rg0t2remember yeah but that was just an example, the damage in the game just feels super high
[3:08:22] ballzagna1: incoming durability patch 2.0
[3:08:30] chalender21: Yes, as a former Kat main, I understand Kappa
[3:08:35] ragtimediddly: any MOBA I've played, if you turn melee characters into burst bombs with loads of HP it becomes a miserable game to play
[3:08:49] ballzagna1: @ragtimediddly dota 2
[3:09:10] Galetea: oof
[3:09:20] if0rg0t2remember: @KayPea I think the Rengar named Zaddy name changed to Fog FYI. Their history shows the exact same games
[3:09:20] ObsceneSanity: why does it take ap assassins to be overpowered for mages to feel any sense of influence on rift
[3:09:26] ragtimediddly: Dota, HotS and HoN
[3:09:33] scaperu: Are we doing another prediction?
[3:10:19] leagueofmine01: I have arrived with well wishes and a hope for ammumu mid!
[3:10:20] Whiteminas_tirith: it doesn't matter how you are play great, many assasin can easily one shut
[3:10:41] cotaz67: no ad items are nerfed for ranged champs
[3:10:56] ragtimediddly: there needs to be counterplay, and because LoL items are very simple there is no way to build against it without just everyone building a zhonyas or something
[3:11:23] OsvaBoian: kaypCheer kaypLove kaypCheer kaypLove kaypCheer kaypLove kaypCheer kaypLove
[3:11:35] Soliy1: Its colddddd
[3:11:53] Whiteminas_tirith: and also mage mid laners so slow
[3:12:17] guiltyprawn: Remove all items kaypTeach And if that doesnt work, remove all champs. Y'all dont get League cuz you couldn't behave KappaClaus
[3:12:18] Cut_n_Run: -28 inc the wind chill yesterday. i dont think i realised what that felt like, its not fun
[3:12:33] Infernolol69: @Whiteminas_tirith thats the point of the  mages btw  xd
[3:13:16] damndani_: Why does it take so long to decide to post a tweet xD
[3:13:25] FiveFM: kaypCheer
[3:13:27] damndani_: Just hit post
[3:13:29] Galetea: I have she's meh
[3:13:32] Zaraki101: What lux buffs?
[3:13:34] nicorasenpai: @KayPea how are the games had to watch late due to fever
[3:13:34] sabiirox: Lissandra is pretty weak atm
[3:13:43] S17Master: @Infernolol69 To be fodder for assassins? Yea, sounds right?
[3:14:10] pusheencatt1: its snek time
[3:14:13] guiltyprawn: I only play ARAM. She was fine. Not as strong as so many others. Not really a counter to melee champs anymore cuz the dmg output just exceeds hers by way too much
[3:14:36] k0t10n: 50 50
[3:14:39] MrOnlyStitch: Oh hello, hello @KayPea  <3
[3:14:46] OsvaBoian: Gotta go getawashing machine,letssee if ican get back beforestream ends kaypLove
[3:14:51] Infernolol69: @S17Master blaming champs and  items  is not the  point just  play  better
[3:14:53] Crossarch: +20 HP, +2 Armour start, +1% attack speed scaling and +5% to shield AP scaling
[3:14:55] Crossarch: Are the Lux buffs
[3:15:10] MrOnlyStitch: ifoxiTulip
[3:15:14] harishm06: WASSSSSUPPPPPP KAYPEAAAAAAAAAA
[3:15:17] Whiteminas_tirith: @infernolol69 but it would be OK if mages have very good damage. Think about you are so slow and mele champs are fast and strong.
[3:15:18] nicorasenpai: is that the build that yozu been using or different?
[3:15:24] MrOnlyStitch: Can i have some stitch emojies here? :o3 please?
[3:15:25] Crossarch: My pleasure!
[3:15:25] twinkerbell_xo: adc lux incoming? Prayge
[3:15:31] Darkcyter: kaypWHAT
[3:15:33] yepein73: cassso winable
[3:15:38] guiltyprawn: kaypSpy Duos are Ahri + Shaco & Kayn + Ornn
[3:15:42] Soliy1: overthinking
[3:15:43] iamtonin: i def have that condition too lmao
[3:15:47] Soliy1: i know the feeling
[3:15:54] mane_infinit: wait what was the name of that? sounds too relatable for me
[3:16:05] Infernolol69: @Whiteminas_tirith mages  are slow champs cuz  they  scale  rly  good  assasins  are spiking  on  1-2 items and then they fall
[3:16:07] OsvaBoian: Isnt that overthinking?
[3:16:25] k0t10n: its called shooting yourself in the foot Kappa
[3:16:35] ElminstersGhost: can confirm, ludens, stormsurge, shadowflame, lichbane is op
[3:16:39] Volgin11: decision paralysis I get that a lot
[3:16:52] Trishia_Schwartz: Soraka's tid bit in the beginning of game lol
[3:16:55] inadream_state: is this EUW ?
[3:17:03] Whiteminas_tirith: @infernolol69 do you think assasins fall, really?
[3:17:05] OsvaBoian: I yolo all mydecisions,never paraluzed
[3:17:07] k0t10n: im making a small website for a coffee place i frequent its coming together real nice peepoHappy
[3:17:16] Cut_n_Run: wow this music is a vibe
[3:17:18] sabiirox: Is cassio good w the new items?
[3:17:33] kendren25: EUWest EU Best
[3:17:42] Infernolol69: @Whiteminas_tirith true a 6 items syndra is weaker  than a talon with 6  items
[3:18:00] Trishia_Schwartz: Ahri's mana consumption is crazy. Her combo takes half her pool :/
[3:18:08] Crossarch: I sometimes fail to do what I want because of the community reaction. Like, my friends focusing on something new in my life, when I feel uncomfortable about it :(
[3:18:49] Crossarch: So I also struggle quite often with making a decision I might really like
[3:18:50] S17Master: Why is Soraka already mad btw? No one died yet
[3:18:55] frostwing125: I think it's time to buff ahri tbh
[3:19:02] Darkcyter: every other mid laner: "We should carefully conserve mana" ... KP: "Hehe, twinfang go brrr"
[3:19:16] Moraloe: probably residual from previous games of being flamed
[3:19:19] Zaraki101: Supports are always mad
[3:19:22] Jun848: are you back in NA?
[3:19:24] damndani_: Is your hair naturally curly? @kaypea
[3:19:36] Frozenfruit13: @Zaraki101 fake news
[3:19:41] Crossarch: @Jun848 Pretty sure the title of the stream says otherwise :D
[3:19:42] Trishia_Schwartz: she's been previously burned by an adc going all in early lol
[3:19:57] kendren25: @Frozenfruit13 This. Sometimes thay;re just upset
[3:20:09] Zaraki101: @Zaraki101 What u talkinhg about its either support or adc always mad
[3:20:42] damndani_: This anri is officially 0/6 on charms xD
[3:20:50] Crossarch: That's a great start...
[3:20:55] twinkerbell_xo: oh..
[3:21:00] kaithegemini: when the grubs are killed I keep thinking for a split second that somebody got a triple kill
[3:21:25] Sunnytinker: as a soraka main we do not claim that soraka player
[3:21:26] twinkerbell_xo: 5 mins into the game is insane
[3:21:33] S17Master: @kaithegemini There are three voidgrubs so technically...
[3:21:33] Nafixx: hii <3
[3:21:41] Crossarch: @twinkerbell_xo Welcome to EUW :D
[3:21:44] nicorasenpai: so when cass killed a minion with her E her mana restores?
[3:21:54] if0rg0t2remember: its always amazing to me how quickly people tilt or give up when the average game is 20+ minutes. Like 5 minutes in is nothing
[3:21:58] Zohrooo: why are you even playing if you don't have the mental fortitude to play T_T
[3:22:01] Zenciria: is it just me or does all champions deal way more dmg than they used to?
[3:22:03] kaithegemini: @s17master I guess technically it is a triple kill…
[3:22:05] slayingibis: THE DODGES
[3:22:16] chalender21: @nicorasenpai a unit, in general. Minions, champs, monsters
[3:22:22] Galetea: she missed all her abilities that feels oof
[3:22:26] Lynxa007: soraka is so easy too
[3:22:27] baPIMPski: EXACTLY
[3:22:31] Froznen: Froznen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 80 months! 
[3:22:40] kendren25: 80?!?
[3:22:46] Moraloe: you could tell from the start they were already tilted. so why keep playing
[3:22:47] kingdomofblue: these people don't have the self awareness to realize that they shouldn't be playing ranked lol
[3:22:52] S17Master: Soraka has an easy to use kit, but she is not easy lol
[3:22:53] Bael_Af: Can u stack rod of ages again?
[3:23:00] mrry2k: a lot of ppl  just have a weird kind of competitiveness x superiority complex
[3:23:07] Trishia_Schwartz: poor kai'sa
[3:23:09] Darkcyter: @Froznen 80 kaypHYPERS WB
[3:23:15] Trishia_Schwartz: now she has to solo lane
