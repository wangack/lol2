[4:51:33] duggs6: smartest adc main using all summs
[4:51:34] Advent_L1: @dantes ADC is only weak in solo queue and lower elo, where your team is not able/willing to peel for you. In lower ELO, every bot is decided by supports, which is why support is one of the easiest roles to carry from
[4:51:35] nomainyett: @miickiss Some mages are weak, some tanks are weak

[4:51:46] Xi0reii: when u dont get 1 shot go play bruiser or tank and stop playing adc xD
[4:51:46] qonflx84: @zuth2 to be fair tho tanks suck in soloq even if they were good which they arent b/c its not a team game its soloq not lcs
