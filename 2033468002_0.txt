[4:43:19] ORANGEkarmaaaa: @kashumee allied supports could do the same but they lack the brain power for some odd reason
[4:43:23] ORANGEkarmaaaa: LUL
[4:43:31] Kashumee: Thats the joke its always enemy support and never mine

[4:45:19] Testogott: chat or chase can anyone fkn tell me what these new lp gains are?=???? i got +16 in master with 60% wr
[4:45:25] Testogott: +16 >XDDD
[4:45:25] ReYLiiX: ah ok sure xD
[4:45:25] Nightbot: if only he was Zoe there
[4:46:01] ORANGEkarmaaaa: they reduced gains above emerald, apparently it's normal to get less especially if you're winstreaking says phroxzon
[4:46:03] ReYLiiX: did u hade a lossing streak?
[4:46:09] fnarf: what a good mf ult damn
[4:46:19] Ace_54: nice
[4:46:19] Testogott: im on 7 winstreak
[4:46:39] ReYLiiX: yeah 1 lose account screwed xD
[4:47:02] Christo_Reyy: Bad champion can't even kill a frog PepeLaugh
[4:47:07] NaClandPepper: @APCh0pstixx thx for the sub :)
[4:47:26] ORANGEkarmaaaa: so apparently the logic is if you're winstreaking they want you to have harder games by less LP gain and if you lose they'll increase your gains a little or whatever riotphroxzon said in the tweet
[4:47:34] ORANGEkarmaaaa: idk it's fucking stupid imo NotLikeThis
[4:47:35] MellowRonin: yo
[4:47:37] ReYLiiX: @Testogott maybe u dont perform well? u have MVP in one from this games?
[4:47:49] Testogott: @ORANGEkarmaaaa LOL WHAT RLY?

[4:51:15] timo_timido: i feel like this season is alot more about objective pressure than actually ganking
[4:51:16] ORANGEkarmaaaa: our bad for playing well and winning multiple games I think
[4:51:24] timo_timido: which feels like crap because you are at mercy of your teammates
[4:51:51] ORANGEkarmaaaa: I think voidgrubs are bait obj if you don't have splitpushing champs anyways, it's super situational

[4:53:18] drigers5: voidgrubs #2 seem huge, and come online way before drags
[4:53:19] Varino24: @ORANGEkarmaaaa what did he say?
[4:53:28] epiphanein: how do u blow up nexus without killing towers XDD
[4:53:41] APCh0pstixx: It's okay bro lol
[4:53:43] ORANGEkarmaaaa: riotphroxzon basically said if you're winstreaking you gain less lp
[4:53:45] ReYLiiX: gj
[4:53:58] NaClandPepper: they give a huge chunk of xp
[4:54:02] DarkSentry1337: oh i didnt know they have a buff
[4:54:10] ORANGEkarmaaaa: in emerald and up the lp is less
[4:54:13] ORANGEkarmaaaa: yeah
[4:54:43] NaClandPepper: yea league streamers seem to be 50/50 on void grubs
[4:55:12] ORANGEkarmaaaa: based take
[4:55:19] timo_timido: i like these little weridos ngl
[4:55:21] fnarf: BASED
[4:55:50] timo_timido: like riot is really good at creating monsters that are satisfying to kill just like scuttle it was like instant crack
[4:55:55] TTrinxx: based
[4:56:12] ORANGEkarmaaaa: am I allowed to link tweets
[4:56:16] ORANGEkarmaaaa: I assume no
[4:56:37] ORANGEkarmaaaa: was gonna find phroxzon statement on lp gains/winstreaking
[4:56:56] Ascension_1v9: are you muted? youre moving your mouse like your trying to say something lmaoo

[4:58:25] ChaseShaco: nah im just chillin
[4:58:33] ORANGEkarmaaaa: oh mb
[4:59:15] ORANGEkarmaaaa: can't believe we're punished for playing good and winstreaking this season I'm legit just about to wait til split2
[4:59:30] APCh0pstixx: Of course my man, a lot of my learning of shaco was wathcing you play honestly
[4:59:40] ORANGEkarmaaaa: unless they fix gains I'm not about to cosplay Sisyphus in soloqueue LUL LUL LUL
[4:59:58] APCh0pstixx: I've only Peaked Plat but aye, can't complain
[5:00:18] HumanSorrows: the thing as well is with removal of smurf queue is that it prolongs how long accounts linger in elos they do not belong
[5:00:56] HumanSorrows: same for the losestreaking which is again, irrational to boot but they gotta force the 50% average somehow.
[5:01:16] ORANGEkarmaaaa: idk it's so demotivating to play
[5:02:01] ORANGEkarmaaaa: I'm a little off gm cutoff in my server but it's so aids to play
[5:03:53] Chocolate_T: riot makes it easier to ward
[5:03:56] Chocolate_T: and people still dont ward

[5:06:11] DANGER: this season is ass all you do is get one shot
[5:06:38] hylianpie: hey chase not complaining about the music volume or anything but if you learn how to use a program called voicemeter you can have different volume levels for you and your stream, IE: quiet for you, loud for stream
[5:07:11] Maxdapanda_: holy cow once in a life time moment, been watching you for a while, and somehow you got in game with my boy
[5:07:28] NotASkiller: @danger welcome to the balance teams dilemma. if champions don't 1 shot, they do no damage. if they do 1 shot, they are op
[5:07:30] RinViri: The void grubs don't die to pet, so you can get all 3 low, and AoE all at the same time to avoid the shield mechanic @ChaseShaco
[5:07:43] drigers5: they didn't want the DoT taking epics, not after the ez ult fiasco
[5:08:09] tommyskyfall: Emilio
[5:08:21] DANGER: @NotASkiller i mean if you build damage, you are weak, if you build tank, you do no damage. Thats how it should be to fulfill team based roles
[5:08:38] DANGER: i dont get why everything has to do 1000% damage
[5:08:48] dariocasa: Rey mimillio
[5:08:59] Chocolate_T: they need stats so they can make adjustments
[5:09:03] Chocolate_T: that's why
[5:09:15] Chocolate_T: it'll be better as the season progresses
[5:09:24] DANGER: maybe they should make a public test server
[5:09:25] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[5:09:32] Chocolate_T: it's still not enough data
[5:09:35] hylianpie: @DANGER small indie company they cant afford it
[5:09:43] MartyrTV1: i thought u put 2 points into w into 3 max with tiamat now
[5:09:46] NotASkiller: and call it... pbe...
[5:09:49] MartyrTV1: why 3 puntos this time mr stermer
[5:09:49] Nightbot: because
[5:09:52] Chocolate_T: the data they get from one day of real time play is more than a week of pbe
[5:10:05] RinViri: Eh, support items are op, it's fine
[5:10:15] hylianpie: @NotASkiller do you know how much MONEY that'll cost them? at LEAST 0.00002% of their income, they can't do that now can they? Kappa
[5:10:32] ORANGEkarmaaaa: idk I actually think this season is pretty fun, the new items are all pretty good, they just need to be adusted better
[5:10:40] NotASkiller: true. they didn't make enough lux skins to afford making good changes
[5:10:41] ORANGEkarmaaaa: adjusted*
[5:10:44] INeedSpaceLoL: in s14 bad fgihts are good fights
[5:10:54] NotASkiller: guys if u want riot to survive, pls buy the new lux skin!!!
[5:11:09] hylianpie: @NotASkiller did you see the new dragon? :tf:
[5:11:25] NotASkiller: @hylianpie I only heard about it. smolder?

[5:11:50] ORANGEkarmaaaa: when will shaco get a legendary skin, I'm genuinely curious how they're going to make it look like absolute garbage
[5:12:07] ORANGEkarmaaaa: they'll find the perfect theme for the champ and completely botch the design
[5:12:22] NotASkiller: @orangekarmaaaa when chase gets 5000 people to main shaco so it will be profitable
[5:12:26] hylianpie: @NotASkiller kinda looking forward to him but at the same time looks elo inflated PepeLaugh
[5:12:30] Testogott: @ORANGEkarmaaaa first lux and ezreal get 3 more legendaries each
[5:12:31] Maxdapanda_: royal shaco best skin

[6:08:36] ORANGEkarmaaaa: that's legit the opportunity item passive
[6:08:43] ORANGEkarmaaaa: the game is showing u the wrong passive
[6:08:45] TTrinxx: @ChaseShaco it's a worse mejai because it onyl gives AD after a kill
[6:09:14] shacotale: @ORANGEkarmaaaa idk why lol dont want to show me items now

[6:09:47] Nightbot: Pog
[6:10:37] ORANGEkarmaaaa: I guess shaco isn't really the best at using the item
[6:11:00] NekoTheCat_: His AD scaling isn't the best
[6:11:14] NekoTheCat_: Like rengar gains 25% bonus AD from passive
[6:11:41] IWBBQChicken: who is skain?
[6:11:42] NekoTheCat_: Just getting the item early would feel bad and getting it late would be worse

[6:12:30] TTrinxx: good on shaco* that is
[6:12:47] NekoTheCat_: Profane hydra is probably the highest damage first item, and that's not accounting for if they're below 50% hp when you use it
[6:12:48] ORANGEkarmaaaa: I legit have no clue about this Ibai situation holy fk
[6:12:50] TTrinxx: it has to be good on multi kill focused assassins
