[1:52:46] Runecrown: Ive seen it
[1:52:50] Runecrown: I promise you dont want to
[1:53:01] snj10111: riftmaker and liandries need to have the same unique passive
[1:53:01] Josephjoestar785: some accounts are really in bad matchups every game like you can understand from that one win one lose one win one lose it happened to me too
[1:53:27] pochacco2000: Viper how much did cupic tank?
[1:53:32] Josephjoestar785: i also played with an another account abd i rushed to masters quickly but i can't do it with main

[1:55:31] Firewalkerz: Lux healed for 7k and took 23k dmg that game
[1:55:38] Loni_art: no
[1:55:42] Pysjamas: standing on aoe
[1:55:45] Loni_art: that baron does crazy dmg
[1:55:50] TealsPuzzles: maybe the purple death zone shouldn't be on the purple background
[1:55:52] ConfidentialTTV: baron aint no joke
[1:55:55] Loni_art: 15% max health per second or smth
[1:56:15] PrefersAwkward: I think Renekton is Riven's biggest counter. Darius can be as well. Also, some ADCs can counter Riven, like Quinn, Vayne, and Varus, but I'm not educated on those matchups

[2:25:18] bwardak: @drakonken yeah also i feel like ravenous hydra sustain was a bit broken before
[2:25:27] drakonken: i feel problematic vs malphite, or when tanks go full armor. But maybe it's just me not good enough

I know She isn't weak but her new playstyle is boring to me.

[2:41:48] fellrain: Is proxying the way you do viable on more than just riven?
[2:41:50] rivenmommynutloy: zoned off a nasus early as riven he was lvl 3 i was 5 going 6.. but i think i threw my lead after when he got lvl 6
[2:41:50] s9jglsuperstar: chinese

[2:42:58] Epytt: I tried it 1 game felt fine
[2:43:00] medicinous: hubris lethality riven !!
[2:43:02] bwardak: why is cleaver bad?
[2:43:05] YEEtora: black clever looks good for a full stack R
[2:43:07] Sensitiky: i guess the build cleaver cus they perma fighting in china sv or am i wrong? @Viper
[2:43:08] i3eastsvk3335: i ve tried it multiple times it helps a lot in tankier matchups
[2:43:10] Flarex7: what runes is he using?
[2:43:10] NothHellNoaKnight: i dont rly understand them chinese players, i dont feel like cleaver does anyting, it's not even good statstick
[2:43:10] hatto__: @viper i think cleaver good if u do alot of trades
[2:43:13] LoLRankBot: Last Game (Riven): Conqueror > Triumph > Legend: Tenacity > Last Stand | Nimbus Cloak > Transcendence | Adaptive Force > Adaptive Force > Magic Resist
[2:43:15] bwardak: @ysy_bwb Afghanistan but i know some Arabic
[2:43:25] hatto__: Like this riven
[2:43:25] PrefersAwkward: It used to be that Speak of Shojun provided much worse CD than Cleaver due to the nerfs of its interactions on Riven Q and E. Not sure if that's still a thing
[2:43:31] HoLDeN830: hi viper
[2:43:31] Mojamsession: cleaver with lethality would go crazy
[2:43:40] bestlosernacho: They do it vs tanks to win early
[2:43:47] LeptonDecay: attack speed rune ever?
[2:43:48] heaven_Chuu: Cleaver rush into renekton
[2:43:54] GoodGrind_Vet: @viper this season is gonna be great for riven I really feel it

[2:44:01] PrefersAwkward: Q and W**
[2:44:01] Ashykala: domination station
[2:44:08] ysy_bwb: @bwardak nice
[2:44:09] dlwlrmalol: @PrefersAwkward cleaver and shojin now have the same haste, then shojin has a non-ultimate ability haste passive
[2:44:10] AlexBloomm: @Viper is there any diffrence between the 2 prestige riven skins?
[2:44:11] Angry_Koala_: ABDULpls
[2:44:16] heincken: the sword on that skin is so akward
[2:44:23] rivenmommynutloy: @AlexBloomm one is more purple
[2:44:23] Mojamsession: @Viper BC gonna be the s14 skin?
[2:44:24] bigmcmuffins: what are the numbers at the top mean? 15/20
[2:44:24] medicinous: @viper you tried hubris/lethality ?
[2:44:25] deziafa: @leptondecay as ? where
[2:44:25] drakonken: i saw a riven player going full resolve main (vs renek)
[2:44:28] Valiantec: We will support you even if you int
[2:44:30] Valiantec: is ok
[2:44:30] bwardak: no way is that really 5fire
[2:44:35] hatto__: Who won the danres challenge?
[2:44:36] ysy_bwb: @bwardak i thought that we know each other 😂
[2:44:39] LeptonDecay: one of the 3 small runes @deziafa
[2:44:42] PrefersAwkward: @adeninelol but Shojun still nerfs CC things, right?
[2:44:44] anakin2701: is this matchupp renek favor ?
[2:44:51] LeptonDecay: makes your q fast combo faster @deziafa
[2:44:55] bwardak: @ysy_bwb who haha
[2:45:06] livatheking: PTA ignite, better call blitz i guess
[2:45:07] dlwlrmalol: @PrefersAwkward im not 100% sure i didnt read the detailed passive
[2:45:09] Mojamsession: can press the attack work on riven?
[2:45:12] deziafa: @leptondecay je is playing as ? not 2x ad????
[2:45:13] HoLDeN830: @Viper when do u go tp instead of ignite
[2:45:14] rivenmommynutloy: we believe in the wiper
[2:45:15] dlwlrmalol: @PrefersAwkward but it gives bonus damage to abilities now
[2:45:16] bestlosernacho: Has PTA dang
[2:45:16] silentslayer009: Pta and ignite if you beat him without resolve you're a witch CaitlynS
[2:45:19] PrefersAwkward: Having a lot of E's is still nice ofc
[2:45:24] bwardak: isn’t renekton weak now
[2:45:25] VermillionHero: Did you blind riven?
[2:45:29] bigmcmuffins: what does 15/20 mean
[2:45:36] ysy_bwb: @bwardak me u cause u answering me, cause some other friends from me watch his stream also
[2:45:50] bwardak: @ysy_bwb ah ok haha
[2:46:01] LeptonDecay: can riven ever match renekton midgame? Seems like he just runs riven down no matter what tbh
[2:46:15] rivenmommynutloy: does any1 know this song?? :,)
[2:46:24] ysy_bwb: @bwardak cause we used to live near each other with Viper and like that as we was children
[2:46:26] silentslayer009: @bwardak ye hes weak but he still beats riven
[2:46:33] LeptonDecay: renekton? Scaling?
[2:46:46] acekiritou: anyone knows the full 1v9 mid champ for lowlow elo
[2:47:05] YEEtora: He got boneplating back there, which was unfair
[2:47:08] valoxflare: nt
[2:47:13] blackmizoo: champ diff

[2:47:25] potatowinter: did you just get smurfed on
[2:47:30] Artikilius: outplayed bro
[2:47:32] heaven_Chuu: Boneplating is still a necessity ?
[2:47:36] rumblevietnam: Ignite to keep cơn stacks
[2:47:37] bwardak: @silentslayer009 is the matchup that bad
[2:47:41] VermillionHero: @viper  did you get counter picked?
