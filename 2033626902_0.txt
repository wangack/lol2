[0:29:31] NawtyTyme: did you say something?
[0:29:34] HideLemonsYo: i always think i have responded but turns out i didnt
[0:29:34] youwiththefeds: Just gotta work on it
[0:29:36] TobyNova: Yeh i can be, pretty introverted really
[0:29:36] vowingentro: i'm really gooa bout it actually
[0:29:37] KhamulESO: ppl leave their phone more often is what i notice
[0:29:38] EggsotiX: Im not big on texting. Rather talk
[0:29:38] Rushinko: I suck at responding and then I get terrible anxiety about it
[0:29:38] kiki_speaks: Sometimes
[0:29:39] pyro_lurkz: no because it's rude
[0:29:41] Stoicgamingx: I used to be really bad but I'm getting better at it
[0:29:48] utracka: !gear
[0:29:48] Nightbot: https://classicwowarmory.com/character/us/crusader-strike/Soniidigital
[0:29:48] kidzz: if they dont hit me up on bnet i never answer
[0:29:51] limburgse: jup!
[0:29:54] dodoswag: nah I respond because I'm a people pleaser
[0:29:54] TobyNova: ADHD haha
[0:29:57] TobyNova: i have it too
[0:30:12] Stoicgamingx: but... I guess if you're a streamer or some kind of bigger creator you probably have a lot of stuff to handle
[0:30:16] Rushinko: that sounds like ADHD brother
[0:30:35] Nightbot: GHOST is having a buy one get one 50% off sale on ALL protein powder, use code "SONII" for an additional 20% off!!! ghostlifestyle.com // uk.ghostlifestyle.com
[0:30:39] kiki_speaks: I do too, but I call it hermit mode lol
[0:30:44] Stoicgamingx: You can't respond to like 500 messages a day unless you have a secretary or something
[0:30:48] azzy_dog: I'm a trainer for work and talk almost all day, I also feel like when I get home I just wanna chill
[0:30:56] bronchoped1: Who doesn't have add anymore
[0:30:56] TobyNova: Yehh it's huge now from social media
[0:30:57] AdamFourtyTwo: yuuuu[
[0:31:01] ShaneiumTheCranium: You ever taken adderal?  Did it mess with you or really center you?
[0:31:05] youwiththefeds: Exactly right
[0:31:09] ShaneiumTheCranium: Could help with a self diagnoses
[0:31:11] Stoicgamingx: I want to try and get screened for ADHD/Autism
[0:31:12] Rushinko: i think the line blurs between ADHD and lack of discipline
[0:31:14] fateofwaves: yeah i can't do anything without my family guyy and subway surfers playing on the second monitor
[0:31:15] TobyNova: Yeh fully
[0:31:35] realmalfurionsr: did you snort it like a normal college student?
[0:31:39] Grimmzsix: forget to hit people back but have tried getting better cause people think im ignoring and it can ruin relationships
[0:31:41] Stoicgamingx: I absolutely don't want to take adderal coffee might be too much for me
[0:31:48] TobyNova: Meditation and exercising is meant to be great for people with ADHD
[0:31:57] bronchoped1: Vyvanse + lifting can be almost too good. Like jack3d on crack
[0:32:01] lampsterof79: Adderall contributed to my son Psychosis.  CAREFUL.  After he came off he has not had an episode in 5 years
[0:32:05] Stoicgamingx: I think I might have the inattentive form rather than the hyperactive form
[0:32:08] DadRage: Caffeine makes me tired with my ADHD.
[0:32:12] ShaneiumTheCranium: I agree.  I was just looking at the correlating factors that could attribute to the ADHD.  If it at least like...somewhat helps you could have it.
[0:32:16] DadRage: Hence why I don't drink it much
[0:32:24] Rushinko: yea some people with ADHD have an opposite reaction to caffeine
[0:32:26] Rushinko: kinda wild
[0:32:29] lampsterof79: Honestly he was given a very small dose
[0:32:31] TobyNova: Of course
[0:32:34] Ilove_togetwet: sounds like he took after the mom
[0:32:35] DadRage: @Rushinko it's annoying LUL
[0:32:36] TobyNova: soniiCozy soniiCozy soniiCozy
[0:32:38] kiki_speaks: Chillin
[0:32:51] limburgse: is that even a question if we are chilling? soniiCozy
[0:32:55] TobyNova: Yeh that REM sleep
[0:33:03] TobyNova: @limburgse aha
[0:33:10] Stoicgamingx: I'm sure there are diminishing returns if you overuse any kind of stimulant
[0:33:16] Rushinko: yea I mean its not gonna create energy out of nothing
[0:33:27] Larrysix: what a sexy cow
[0:33:46] DadRage: Yeah, if It doesn't catch my attention and hold it, I'm fucked.
[0:33:47] Larrysix: looks geared
[0:33:47] TobyNova: It's the small amounts of dopamine from things like infinitely scrolling
[0:33:50] HideLemonsYo: yeah your more likely to focus more on something youre interested in
[0:34:19] gl000my: my smell is still fecked
[0:34:25] bronchoped1: Covid seemed to affect everyone negatively to a degree. Brain fog etc
[0:34:36] Halzakk: my smell and asthma got fucked cause of covid
[0:34:37] artorias_tv: Didnt get covid Feelsgoodman
[0:34:46] LordStrez: yeah 3+ years since I caught it and still have tiny issues with smell and taste
[0:34:57] Stoicgamingx: That is also true-- but I know for me the inattentiveness has been a lifelong problem. I could attribute some of it to anxiety... currently I have Bipolar II but I'm not sure if I have something else which is why I want to check. My mood has been relatively stable
[0:35:02] TobyNova: Yeh same with lockdown all we could do was check social media
[0:35:04] holdmybeerkid: when i'm single it's worse
[0:35:04] jschroe3: worse in what way?
[0:35:11] weuweuweuoouooouuuooouuuu: I couldn't smell my c00m when I had covid...lol
[0:35:14] Rushinko: also, even if you compare games from 10-20 years ago to video games now, its a lot more about small frequent stimulation. Tik Tok is the biggest example of this. even comparing mario odyssy to old mario games, odyssy has a bunch of little "stars", not like old games
[0:35:16] lampsterof79: A lot of us are lost since Pandemic
[0:35:18] jschroe3: you spending too much time on it you mean?
[0:35:29] Stoicgamingx: Paradoxically... the pandemic is probably the best thing that ever happened to me
[0:35:36] Stoicgamingx: I function better on a computer and being alone
[0:35:36] ShaneiumTheCranium: During Covid is when I dropped Social Media.  I realized how much it truly doesn't matter.  I could use that time to spend with my kids and not scrolling about how much I dont care to look at someones life when Im missing out on my own.
[0:35:39] Rushinko: I removed all social media from my home screen on my phone and pretty much stopped using them because of it
[0:36:08] Gyrospeter: As a software engineer during covid i had the best time of my life sadge
[0:36:08] Rushinko: and if I find my way to instagram reels, i try to remind myself not to doom scrool
[0:36:20] Halzakk: social media was worse back in 2020 cause it was our only form of communion to other people
[0:36:25] ShaneiumTheCranium: I think you fit a niche thing for that though.  Most people don't.
[0:36:31] hiddenalienlol: just jerked it for 2hrs
[0:36:34] jschroe3: its where i get my news Kappa
[0:36:34] TobyNova: We definitely need to be in nature more
[0:36:59] TobyNova: They prescribe being in nature in Germany for depression and/or anxiety haha
