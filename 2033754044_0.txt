[5:58:52] Corabashi: I hated wheel of time could not get past that guys writing. I heard the sanderson novels are good but just not worth it for me
[5:58:54] Yewf: @TheKnightsofNeeee Wheel of time definitely has some slow points and I'm not really sold on Sanderson's books.  Overall good series though
[5:58:54] SabreSworn: fun fact: the longest book that has ever been created was 724 pages long.
