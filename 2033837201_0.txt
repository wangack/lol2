[0:38:06] Mag_Lev: I don't mind the cold, the only problem I have is people can't drive in snow and ice Smadge
[0:38:06] FilthySerf: @Euiik Susge It was -40c all week where I live here in Canada
[0:38:08] pandalisk9: its only like 22f here
[0:38:09] SnailsOnAChalkboard: Welcome to the freeze!
[0:38:10] FilthySerf: -40c is pretty cold
[0:38:15] Green0wl: Canadian experiencing heat death of the universe: "Ooh, pretty brisk today, ey?"
[0:38:16] fluffypandaa214: preach euiik let hell freeze over
[0:38:22] bighappyturtl3: The government isnt built for it
[0:38:25] Kailour: the cold olympics
[0:38:26] Euiik: THATS NOT WHAT I MEANT
[0:38:28] thatluckyloser: Texas is not made as a state to handle large problems all at once. Its not the temperature, its the systems not able to handle it
[0:38:35] Kailour: or I guess temperature olympics
[0:38:36] Euiik: I was referring to the housing and state nerd
[0:38:36] DraygoDraygon: The systems by design
[0:38:39] bighappyturtl3: Pipes arent far enough underground, they dont have salt reserves for the roads, etc
[0:38:51] littledebbiecakesinmybut: Our houses and infrastructure and roads and everything aren't built for it
[0:38:51] SnailsOnAChalkboard: I spent the last two evenings winter proofing my outdoor pipes and garden
[0:39:00] DraygoDraygon: Also the power infrastructure literally not connected to the rest of the US
[0:39:06] geggidy: Yeah in Austin if it's snowy or icy conditions the whole city would just shut down
[0:39:14] DraygoDraygon: So tons of people just died when the local power went out
[0:39:22] omgwhatlolz: I was in SA TX a few years ago when it snowed. had rolling black outs so we go 4 hours of electricity a day and didnt have water for a week
[0:39:23] Euiik: When I was in school I legit would stand and wait for the bus in shorts
[0:39:30] thatluckyloser: Also Texas has a ton of clay so building deep underground sucks and foundations move
[0:39:33] Don_Savik: I'm one of those minnesotans that wears shorts in the winter Sadge I feel attacked
[0:39:36] Euiik: like while its -20 ext because i was dumb
[0:39:38] TheGrayPlains: I mean the wardrobe is also a factor. Lawlman might have a winter jacket but it'd make sense that it could be packed away most days
[0:39:43] bighappyturtl3: @Don_Savik Fellow Minnesotan Pog
[0:39:50] Euiik: We all make mistakes
[0:39:54] thatluckyloser: So the homes tend not to be able to take much
[0:39:54] Don_Savik: @bighappyturtl3 you betcha
[0:39:59] bighappyturtl3: @bighappyturtl3 ope
[0:40:05] pandalisk9: i spent a month in wisconsin during the winter and i appreciate my mideast winters now
[0:40:08] Euiik: I played soccer and shit and only wore soccer shorts

[0:40:15] DraygoDraygon: Climate change be a bitch
[0:40:17] Euiik: Cold or not
[0:40:17] SnailsOnAChalkboard: The freeze in Austin was rough. I was out power for almost a week. I don't think it's gonna be that bad this time though
[0:40:22] thatluckyloser: Climate Change lawlmanScared
[0:40:25] aehssremmus: true
[0:40:28] FilthySerf: 20 years ago when you walked up hill both ways to school

[0:40:49] Kailour: we used to only have to worry about 80 - 100F YEPLOUD we've had so few ice storms that old people will go "Remember that ice storm back in '96"
[0:40:50] isyourTVrunning: my buddy went to college at SDSU and I never believed him that it was 60-80 year round
[0:40:51] WinterKnightHarryDresden: I live in the HD Socal. it gets windy af up here. i notice the temp change
[0:40:51] Mag_Lev: Yea, this is the first time in the part of my state that I've had more than an inch of snow.
[0:40:52] Euiik: I would have been like 9
[0:40:56] Euiik: GOD
