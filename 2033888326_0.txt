[1:11:51] Daxter264: @shadowymisstep oh shit nice
[1:12:32] blue_crayon48: Any sups you really dislike playing against atm?
[1:12:54] Timkiro: did u watch KC vs MAD
[1:13:00] shadowymisstep: I mean listen I'm not gonna complain about Western Conference teams losing rn
[1:13:05] shadowymisstep: I need the Oilers to crawl back up there
[1:13:08] Timkiro: epic targamas performance
[1:13:11] FurahTV: HAHAH
[1:13:16] FurahTV: Oh non philippe
[1:13:17] blue_crayon48: KC MAD crowd was insanely fun
[1:13:20] cozycoffin_: why is KC a tier 1 team
[1:13:28] Timkiro: watch upset cam pov
[1:13:30] Timkiro: every time he misses an arrow
[1:13:31] shadowymisstep: @cozycoffin_ Kamento rolling in dough
[1:13:35] pathb4place: vlcnDIFF
[1:13:45] cozycoffin_: i actually think IMT is better than KC
[1:13:46] FurahTV: La performance était pas folle j'avoue
[1:13:46] shadowymisstep: Feel kinda bad for the KC lads but also. Kinda funny
[1:13:48] Timkiro: i can see the frustration in him
[1:14:01] Timkiro: wat support item do u finish on senna
[1:14:04] Timkiro: do u get spellblade?
[1:14:18] Timkiro: really?
[1:14:23] Timkiro: cus the spellblade dmg is so bad, it's just base ad
[1:14:27] Timkiro: and senna base ad is 50 entire game
[1:14:34] abyssaltempest: 8% bonus on range chapm is op
[1:14:37] abyssaltempest: dmg
[1:14:51] cozycoffin_: KC is competing with Vitality for 10 place finish
[1:15:07] l3engee2: Pas des gars de math icitte
[1:15:19] shadowymisstep: I find the focus on KC and MDK somewhat frustrating
[1:15:47] Timkiro: @shadowymisstep why?
[1:15:48] shadowymisstep: And also the fact a lot of the attitude is excused as "passion for the game"
[1:15:50] abyssaltempest: leona?
[1:15:58] ghostsxdd: moé
[1:16:02] l3engee2: Ashe c'est encore dope?
[1:16:06] l3engee2: Mesemble pas encore vue une dans mes games
[1:16:09] Timkiro: ibai brings in 200k views, kameto brought 140k
[1:16:28] shadowymisstep: @Timkiro Dislike overemphasis on regional stuff personally (FR and ES). It's not like they're bad, I just personally am not a fan
[1:17:01] shadowymisstep: (shrug) personal preference
[1:17:21] FurahTV: KC vs MDK is actually the new LEC record, the 3 days KC game beat the previous viewership record
[1:17:30] shadowymisstep: Christ, really?
[1:17:34] Timkiro: by alot
[1:17:44] ayalabrennan515: yeah it was like 761k viewers or somethin
[1:17:45] Timkiro: https://gyazo.com/02605e3884c894482d25c555870a8d5e
[1:17:51] Timkiro: SFW, just screenshot of viewership
[1:18:03] FurahTV: yeah 741k
[1:18:11] shadowymisstep: I think acting like viewership is the be-all end-all number is healthy for discussion in broadcast broadly
[1:18:46] shadowymisstep: I'm not saying that the introduction of the new audience is bad, but I don't wanna say that it's good just because the number is big y'know
[1:18:48] FurahTV: last peak was KC G2 yesterday 644k
[1:18:59] FurahTV: yeah sure
[1:19:21] FurahTV: players seems to enjoy the banter ambiance overall its hype up
[1:19:24] cozycoffin_: im actually surprised EU hasnt won worlds with how many more players they have compared to KR
[1:19:46] shadowymisstep: @FurahTV Yeah as long as people are okay in the end. If I don't like it it's my problem I just mute the stream y'know
[1:20:01] FurahTV: fair
[1:20:24] shadowymisstep: I worry about what happens when we give overexcited people too much leeway
[1:20:27] shadowymisstep: Like in football or w/e
[1:20:46] shadowymisstep: If people start getting hurt I'll be more concerned
[1:21:01] FurahTV: can't break the cycle, prolly gonna become like real sport football for example if it grow bigger, in the end i guess, if it doesnt crash before
[1:21:22] FurahTV: everything have pros & cons i guess :/
[1:21:43] shadowymisstep: And that's fair, I just find people are way too focused on all the pros to acknowledge the possible cons
[1:22:01] shadowymisstep: Hope for the best prepare for the worst right
[1:22:05] FurahTV: yeah this might be possible
[1:22:06] Timkiro: i go future's market on senna, im too low elo to get cookie value
[1:22:30] FurahTV: yeah wise quote

[1:55:44] shadowymisstep: PauseChamp pray tell
[1:56:20] kinjalka: you like the changes where all  LCS games will be played on live patch?
[1:56:21] shadowymisstep: How much is three percent????
[1:56:24] kinjalka: I think its dope
[1:56:32] shadowymisstep: ????????????
[1:56:45] shadowymisstep: Variability
[1:56:47] kinjalka: variance
[1:56:49] shadowymisstep: Variance, even
[1:56:50] KrowFPS: variation
[1:56:51] Cranked52: to me that sounds kinda psychotic
[1:56:57] Enkidutorix: I've got nothing to do, guess I'll watch this rando. Awaille pète leur la gueule DarkMode
[1:57:03] kinjalka: Verizon i think
[1:57:05] shadowymisstep: They all mean similar things
[1:57:07] Cranked52: i mean imagine if there are sudden bugs
[1:57:09] shadowymisstep: Randomness, if you want
[1:57:23] shadowymisstep: See we're a learning chat. This is educational
[1:57:52] SaucekayTV: vulcan
[1:57:56] DeathCuroxas: Imagine, je me suis fait hack mon compte pendant que j'ai arrêter de jouer pendant 1an et le gars a juste fait des rank et ma drop a bronze quand je suis revenu...
[1:58:10] SaucekayTV: do you like chipotle burritos? if so what is your favorite burrito order
[1:58:11] Enkidutorix: Sus story bro
[1:58:16] DeathCuroxas: Je te le dis
[1:58:24] DeathCuroxas: Ya fallu que j'écrive a Riot direct
[1:58:35] Enkidutorix: lol
[2:00:35] Enkidutorix: I see Varus everywhere, what am I missing that makes him 1st pick among ADCs.
[2:01:55] kinjalka: He's super flexible with either standard adc or poke build, and he has strong laning
[2:02:38] Enkidutorix: I see, do people still use his tank build to survive in this League of One Shots?
[2:02:40] DruidOfTheNorth: yoink exp and then get to roaming xD
[2:03:00] kinjalka: ive never heard of varus ever having a tank build lol
[2:03:35] kinjalka: @DruidOfTheNorth actual bard dream haha
[2:04:04] Enkidutorix: @ kinjalka https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18udyc1/streamers_meet_tank_varus_top_pt_2/
[2:05:00] Heywazzaa: did he end up going skarner support?
[2:07:47] kinjalka: thats pretty funny, I havent played myself since the preseason started so maybe there's some good cheese out there with him there. In bot he still goes a more standard build though as far as I know
[2:07:48] UjoFM: What are the icicles for?
[2:08:21] PulsarMajic: @Enkidutorix Varus has very high mixed base damage in his kit. His W gives him on-hit magic damage on his autos and a three stack passive that also does magic damage when you hit your abilities. He has utility on R and flexible builds
[2:08:37] PulsarMajic: @Enkidutorix just checks a lot of boxes for pro play
[2:09:04] crud_r: C9 content machine in overdrive this preseason - love it
[2:09:08] imnotkreative11: Have you tried mandate bard at all ?
[2:09:20] crud_r: blaber and vulcan filling up my twitch feed
[2:09:38] UjoFM: Oh, thanks Vulcan! Nice to know! I don't know much about the game cause I don't play it but I do enjoy watching it a lot.
[2:09:39] Enkidutorix: I'd probably just check the Lose LP box on Varus but I'll try him (or they?) out.
[2:10:28] Heywazzaa: I noticed a few pro say something like “let’s do a bard lane” when they have a bad matchup or something, idk. What do they mean by that? Does bard have no counter?
[2:10:29] kinjalka: almost giga brain
[2:11:14] PulsarMajic: @Heywazzaa Bard is a very strong roamer and creates chaos in a game essentially with his R and E providing strong pick potential
[2:11:51] UjoFM: That Bard is zooooming around the map
[2:11:55] Heywazzaa: So do they mean to take a bard lane in order to sort of ditch the laning phase?
[2:12:08] Heywazzaa: Or many not ditch, but avoid playing the 2v2?
[2:12:14] kinjalka: yea
[2:12:40] PulsarMajic: @Heywazzaa exactly, jsut lane long enough to let Bard get some levels and then just have him run all over the map.
[2:12:59] Heywazzaa: ohh gotcha! thx
[2:13:40] UjoFM: You have the 6 GrubHubbies!
[2:13:57] Mojokkal8: yo @Vulcan_LoL when does my announcement come out for c9
[2:14:11] crud_r: i mean void grubs have to be sponsored by GrubHub, no?
[2:14:18] PulsarMajic: @Heywazzaa bard passive also helps with this, since the chime she picks up also give him some xp so he doesn't need to be near minions as much to gain levels
[2:14:43] kinjalka: Please no GrubHub Void Grub sponsor reel segment lmao
[2:15:00] crud_r: it writes itself lol
[2:15:05] kinjalka: I'll bud light ace myself
[2:15:18] crud_r: right on top of the state farm analyst desk
[2:15:32] Heywazzaa: ok but then the adc has to 1v2 most of the game?
[2:15:57] Enkidutorix: sounds like my day-to-day in low elo
[2:16:27] kinjalka: usually its done with ad's that can farm safe and survive like ezreal
[2:17:01] PulsarMajic: @Heywazzaa sometimes yeah. Bard tends to pair well with safer ADs
[2:17:32] PulsarMajic: ^
[2:18:29] crud_r: Too Tanky.
[2:18:35] kinjalka: unlucky synergy
[2:18:44] crud_r: riven ulted away from 4 lol
[2:18:50] crud_r: unlucky
[2:20:34] TheFizzy99: wanted to learn support which champs coudl u recommend? coming from adc^^
[2:21:11] BabyMomoII: Why no one plays neeko supp?
[2:21:17] TheFizzy99: thank u ^^
[2:21:21] Enkidutorix: I see a bunch of ADC mains climbing with Janna, why is she so strong? Or is she just great at climbing?
[2:21:41] DeathCuroxas: Les games pro commencent quand ?
[2:22:13] BalloonHorses: Whoever is vigorously typing in the background types very fast
[2:22:17] BabyMomoII: Tu regardes la LEC ?
[2:22:52] Xayah: i heard you're the only good support in na thoughts?

[2:23:16] ragsforfred: Not the only good one just the best one
[2:23:18] Bereneth: I'm excited I can wear my C9 Vulcan jersey again hehe
[2:23:37] imnotkreative11: sorry if you replied i missed it, what do you think of mandate bard? Seems like it would be good
[2:23:53] Cranked52: do you watch other pro supports ? maybe from eu or asia ?
[2:23:53] fatgiraffe_lol: got it ty
[2:24:41] BabyMomoII: Je trouve la ashe avait pas d’impact
[2:25:02] 44kiki_: J'etais trop content quand t'es allé chez flyquest parce que t'allais enfin jouer contre jojo
[2:25:09] Enkidutorix: I'd have a Vulcan shirt already if there wasnt so much player movement in LCS..We need jersey merch for player of the week with just the player name and LCS logo

[2:34:17] BabyMomoII: He loves u
[2:35:44] crud_r: that's the correct answer lol
[2:37:18] Enkidutorix: with LCS being on live patch I'm confident some wacky stuff will appear this season, he'll be forced into fiestas.
[2:38:10] crud_r: oh i'm sure, but I just hope with the hands c9 has and the aggro mindset
[2:38:22] BabyMomoII: Omg solari pour tank leur dmg/burst
[2:38:23] crud_r: we don't get stuck in mage snore festivals as drastically superior meta wise
