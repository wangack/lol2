[0:08:56] Hi_ImPhantomere: is cabo washed nowÉ
[0:09:11] addaberry: watch this game and find out lol
[0:09:16] balance_cs: @MonteCristo have you noticed in the EU games how teams will take both sets of void grubs early and then just never use them to push turrets? Is there a reason they do that?
[0:09:31] RawssDeBawss: from what I've seen, smashes ERLs, isn't doing too well in LEC
[0:09:54] fatalqwerty: but hey we get backstage previews from LEC Kappa
[0:10:42] Atarion_94: Gilius said on Doms stream that Cabo barely practiced any meta pics during the In Houses
[0:11:11] biggerbeefey: Kinda annoying chants
[0:11:24] TastyAMG: Yet another day of TO's fellating themselves over their crowd ResidentSleeper
[0:11:47] Fire_elemen6: I feel like a lot of the matches today, the teams that "felt" like they were ahead by vibes were always behind in gold. Is that because the teams have only had a week to figure out their shit or because the patch is rubberbanding in your opinion?
[0:11:53] TastyAMG: What are your thoughts on KC's draft Dom and Gilius really liked it
[0:11:54] Itsifi: cabo gotta go man

[0:19:01] TastyAMG: Seems like Bo wanted to fight and Upset didn't
[0:19:03] Thythorns: Bo is talking constantly
[0:19:11] miguidb: playing ashe and aphelios had cs advantge at level 3 lol
[0:19:53] TastyAMG: Elyoya looks like a completely different player so far
[0:19:55] Fire_elemen6: Alvaro placing that ward is what made him die though, right?
[0:20:08] fx_fanslowika: @TastyAMG in a good or bad way?
[0:20:09] TastyAMG: This was wild from Saken
[0:20:27] EkyoHots: I just feel like LEC in general is not in a good spot this year
[0:20:33] TastyAMG: @fx_fanslowika bad way, he just doesn't seem like the same player that was running the LEC
[0:21:02] fx_fanslowika: @TastyAMG when he was running the lec he ran into 2 very dysfunctional teams in rogue and g2 that shouldve contended
[0:21:18] Thythorns: KC are gonna be buns in winter, will look like a real team in spring
[0:21:24] fx_fanslowika: and had prime kaiser humanoid 3v3 that eu just couldnt match
[0:21:38] Atarion_94: @EkyoHots As long as its better than last year and we beat NA internationally...
[0:22:20] TastyAMG: @fx_fanslowika Could be, idk if he doesn't have confidence in his team or what the issue is but he doesn't look like the same player to me
[0:22:45] fx_fanslowika: @TastyAMG he plays with 4 rookies and probably has to shotcall for them all while being their star player
[0:23:07] Itsifi: targamas arrows this game where a crime
[0:23:09] fx_fanslowika: not everybody is jankos and thats fine it will get better
[0:23:13] fatalqwerty: LUL they only talk through emotes and pings
[0:23:24] TastyAMG: @fx_fanslowika Yeah im inclined to believe that's the issue and hopefully it is because he was such a pleasure to watch.
[0:23:51] Fire_elemen6: Bo just mutes all when he loads into the game

[0:24:57] TastyAMG: He has not been good yea
[0:25:05] EkyoHots: @Fire_elemen6 this is why the fnc game got delayed, they couldn't figure out why razork can't hear anyone on his team
[0:25:13] EkyoHots: Kappa
[0:25:32] Fire_elemen6: LMAO
[0:25:52] fx_fanslowika: he didnt seem to have those issues in inhouses but stage is different
[0:26:29] EkyoHots: I mean in inhouses he had solo laners who didn't farm under the turret for 15 minutes
[0:26:36] balance_cs: They pick ashe/cait, then go even in lane and ignore dragon
[0:26:52] chumy2222: After targamas get lv6 this game become a pain to watch.
[0:27:09] fx_fanslowika: targamas laning didnt improve from the g2 days ig

[0:27:56] TastyAMG: Targamas and Cabo have been massive issues for KC so far
[0:28:01] fatalqwerty: did I just watch KC whiff everything in a 5 second window?
[0:28:02] TastyAMG: don't worry monte it gets worse
[0:28:08] SESRoots: o7
[0:28:26] Lamynator: even if that hits, what would they do off that?
[0:28:28] chumy2222: @miguidb But at least you did not have to see the Targamas ult.
[0:28:30] Naxser: @MonteCristo Still I believe that KC did well against Fnatic, G2, and Mad.  It's obvious they have many things to improve but I believe the next week will be a good one for them
[0:28:33] Kerengeoff: no shot they kill
[0:28:35] TastyAMG: @Lamynator blow his cleanse ig
[0:28:46] balance_cs: Honestly I know it hasn't been popular for a while, but what do you think about if they had swapped ashe/cait to top lane at the beginning of the game, and taken grub control since they have infinite push and good turret taking power?
[0:28:50] TJ_Angel: get cleanse off
[0:28:53] sota_cat: taga cant play anything beside sena，cabo dogshit on lane，saken dogshit in team fight

[0:29:14] TastyAMG: @balance_cs Lane swap doesn't work anymore
[0:29:23] Atarion_94: Its tome for Targamas to join the LCS I guess
[0:29:46] Kanokie: NANI

[0:30:25] EkyoHots: @MonteCristo go back, you didnt see the ashe arrow
[0:30:38] Sokired: I think this game Bo was solo 1v9
[0:30:45] balance_cs: @TastyAMG Why not? I haven't followed too much meta, but aren't they basically the same lane it's just whether you want to prioritize dragon or herald?
[0:30:47] fatalqwerty: Bo feels just like a challenger jungler just queued with KC LUL

[0:31:10] sota_cat: @Sokired that was upset，1 vs 8
[0:31:14] TastyAMG: or resistances rather
[0:31:29] fatalqwerty: they blew a lot of summs for him
[0:31:29] Kerengeoff: that was big got heal and flash
[0:31:32] balance_cs: @TastyAMG even if you got 6 grubs and ashe/cait range?
[0:31:37] Sokired: @sota_cat yet he threw died for free at the end
[0:32:03] TastyAMG: @balance_cs Don't think you can is the problem. Monte would know for sure

[0:35:17] EkyoHots: did this dude even hit a single arrow the whole game?
[0:35:24] Fire_elemen6: The gold gap is Bo I'm pretty sure
[0:35:24] TastyAMG: @EkyoHots i think he hit one

[0:47:25] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo Is watching Rekkles play in academy consider a banger game?
[0:47:26] fatalqwerty: maybe Trymbi's like Thorfinn in Vinland Saga.... he doesn't have enemies anymore.
[0:47:50] balance_cs: Also makes me laugh that ashe has the scouting ability(I can't remember the name of it), but Targamas has been using his ult to scout baron
[0:48:07] kerokerogrips: seems like the lcs blundered with  caedrel not  costreaming them
[0:48:43] Thythorns: The vision control has been horrid this game from kc. That's what made the least sense to me

[0:56:12] Clyde1500: fast, cheap, efficient idk.
[0:56:24] vishfulthinkng: imagine his LlinkedIn profile
[0:56:29] Dragonslave49: probably a better way to go that the poor job of lethal injection they do in some parts of the USA
[0:56:32] f3lchmaster9000: KC is gonna be good in Summer. I'm calling it. TH is gonna win Winter. This is my hot take.
[0:56:37] zen__cloud: jax selling the ruby crystal for maw is so strange
[0:56:37] ddpbr: kc mid choking on stage
[0:56:40] Turole: Hear me out chat. If a billionaire comits a crime, no matter how small, they should get the guillotine
[0:56:41] dah777: xin not building mercs is sus too
[0:56:43] Fissiccisst: I think, in New Hampshire, Hanging is technically a legal death sentence choice, but obviously noones done it in ages
[0:56:49] Turole: Motivate them to distribute some wealth
[0:56:55] Banterlife: needs some lessons from mercslamont
[0:57:03] EkyoHots: Cabo got the economy of an average village in slovakia

[0:57:44] sota_cat: match making，its bo you know what it is
[0:57:47] Fire_elemen6: But what if instead, more damage

[0:58:49] vishfulthinkng: these arrows man
[0:58:50] sota_cat: 5head
[0:58:51] killerwhalekj: what did he do in lpl
[0:58:54] Turole: @Fissiccisst The point of the death sentence isn't to be efficient, it's to punish convicts. As seen by drug shortages and a refusal to change to more humane/available techniques
[0:58:57] Fire_elemen6: If you kill them before they CC you, you win
[0:59:04] sota_cat: @killerwhalekj match fixing
[0:59:05] addaberry: we need a targamas arrow highlight reel
[0:59:17] kerokerogrips: lpl scandal? oh no please dont tell me it was another hushed abortion ?

[0:59:59] Itsifi: just put him on senna duty
[1:00:09] balance_cs: Also he has ashe E? Just wait the 15 seconds
[1:00:20] vishfulthinkng: that auto upset did to kill akali is very cool
[1:00:40] sota_cat: the fking arrow hits me
[1:00:42] kerokerogrips: if sports betting sponsors league do you anticipate there being more match fixing scandals ?
[1:00:46] dah777: its like the starter pistol that signals the teamfigh, ash arrow LUL
[1:01:14] vishfulthinkng: because akali was in shroud
[1:01:33] Banterlife: i like that specc client is still bugged for annoucements

[1:02:15] Broodshrimp: how many ults did ashe land?
[1:02:24] kAtz124: does he took 2 tenacity rune or what??
[1:02:30] Oraclon: cait 1v1 kills akali
[1:02:54] vishfulthinkng: those traps don't do anything
[1:02:54] killerwhalekj: kc mid is choker
[1:02:55] sota_cat: do you think bo think this team can have any chance to make worlds，then just make some money，match fixing lec version
[1:02:57] lyfjabergen: Whoever called that should be held accountable like perkz imo
[1:03:01] Oraclon: cabo has good position but ashe is somewhere off the map
[1:03:30] Quanze_: This jax pick doesnt make sense, specially in first pick
[1:03:40] Oraclon: they are not on the same page, upset wants to back off
[1:03:58] kerokerogrips: dude tried to take off his shirt
[1:04:18] lyfjabergen: Bo and Upset look dead inside half the time - that kinda looks like an implosion waiting to happen
[1:04:19] Oraclon: do  you think the game can be saved if they play the baron diffrently, monte?
[1:04:21] Quanze_: Cabo and Targa choked hard
[1:04:42] lyfjabergen: @kerokerogrips I think what you were trying to say here is that he failed to take it off, which makes it even better
[1:04:57] EkyoHots: elyoya sacrificed a lot of camps for keeping bot alive

[1:05:05] vishfulthinkng: upset doesn't seem to be in sync with team, and targamas needs to learn how to play
[1:05:05] balance_cs: I am excited for LCK to start, as probably the only KDF fan after the news of T1 scrimming KDF for worlds. Maybe T1 taught them some good things
[1:05:07] Clyde1500: please SK save our eyes
[1:05:08] gspotted98: Another day to feel bad for Yamato you mean
[1:05:12] Zampeh_: Bangers only also covers games which make you wanna bang your head into a wall on repeat
[1:05:24] Quanze_: ISMA is so good
[1:05:27] fx_fanslowika: Not watching the TH game?
[1:05:29] luxury_ball: Im kinda excited to watch t1 challengers
[1:05:30] fx_fanslowika: shame
[1:05:49] MissingMatter: How long until we get Karmine Corpse memes?
[1:05:52] Quanze_: AHAHHA
[1:05:54] Banterlife: nisqy the jungler whisper strikes again
[1:06:22] fx_fanslowika: With riot planning their own HOF do you think any western players get in?
[1:06:36] Quanze_: Irrelevant gigachad blinds jax first and carry with ISMA
[1:06:49] killerwhalekj: froggen
[1:06:49] Banterlife: if u stall out a game long enough vs TH they will retire
[1:06:57] balance_cs: Froggen probably sohuld too
[1:07:01] fatalqwerty: washed Kappa
[1:07:03] Fissiccisst: for some reason I just can't stand doublelift
[1:07:18] Peris_GR: And I am a greek who wants you to talk about Forg1ven Kappa
[1:07:21] lyfjabergen: The only western player who should get into the HOF is Vilerose
[1:07:28] zen__cloud: do you think azir is good on this patch?
[1:07:31] SESRoots: inb4 Regi HoF
[1:07:36] Fissiccisst: Dyrus for Top HOF
[1:07:57] fx_fanslowika: i honestly just wonder how many people should they get in to still maitain the prestige of being hofer
[1:08:03] Fissiccisst: Someone's gon get Cranked
[1:08:09] Shobes572: Cheer500 really loving the breakdown so far, but where’s the burger
[1:08:32] Quanze_: what other mids (besides azir, akali and neeko) you think are viable now?
[1:08:35] TheTraderKing: where burger Kappa
[1:08:35] dowiet: >:[
[1:08:46] Neumonyx: hurray! Bangers time
[1:08:47] Clyde1500: maybe when you're back in the US Kappa
[1:08:50] RomanticCreampie: burgers are fine if you skip the fries and soda
[1:08:52] Fissiccisst: Simply do more Muay Thai to compensate for the burgers
[1:08:52] Neumonyx: finally something good to watch
[1:08:55] Tazzasaurus: fat like travis gafford?
[1:09:00] lyfjabergen: Wdym fat, it's winter so it's called a bulk I think
[1:09:05] Lamynator: also depends where you get the burger.  Heart Attack Grill, yeah maybe you'll get fat
[1:09:16] dowiet: frank burger gragas skin PogChamp
[1:09:29] capita_pug: I'd play veigar into these
[1:09:33] Quanze_: I think vi would actually be better
[1:09:42] Quanze_: and not sej

[1:10:00] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[1:10:18] Quanze_: oh sorry
[1:10:22] balance_cs: Not a lot of waveclear on either of these teams. I guess azir is ok
[1:10:29] lyfjabergen: Is there anything you would slot in instead of Kalista? I dont like the short range into basically all of the enemy comp
[1:10:33] Naxser: @MonteCristo What do you think about the Hall of Legends? Would be your first player inducted?
[1:11:01] Fissiccisst: Uzi?
[1:11:04] fatalqwerty: Ambition! Kreygasm
[1:11:06] Clyde1500: They just don't use it until faker retires Kappa
[1:11:07] killerwhalekj: smeb
[1:11:12] BellabongXC: Madlife
[1:11:15] RawssDeBawss: Diamondprox :D
[1:11:15] fatalqwerty: Longpanda Kappa
[1:11:20] Fissiccisst: I wasn't sure if he was still playing
[1:11:25] SESRoots: Xpek
[1:11:28] fx_fanslowika: Mata is a good one
[1:11:29] Neumonyx: You should create your own Hall of Legends, Or Monte Legends. That way the players that deserve it get it
[1:11:30] throwawaychris: score
[1:11:31] balance_cs: Bengi
[1:11:33] phinvincible: LPL is next week and i've got no idea what the teams are LUL
[1:11:38] Tazzasaurus: wolf?
[1:11:40] dbowell96: surely Score and Pray are first ballot
[1:11:44] Clyde1500: locodoco Kappa
[1:11:46] zazentsuko: wait, is Monte fluent in Korean?
[1:11:46] fatalqwerty: xPeke peaked at season 3
[1:11:51] phinvincible: Does Bjergsen make the cut LUL
[1:11:52] Fissiccisst: Wait, Madlife!
[1:11:54] lyfjabergen: Bengi is gonna get in I tell you
[1:11:57] fx_fanslowika: Uzi said he doesnt think hes capable of playing pro anymore but who knows
[1:12:09] BellabongXC: Hall of Fame gonna inflate some coaching salaries
[1:12:09] Shobes572: gogoing
[1:12:13] fatalqwerty: What about Insec?
[1:12:19] dbowell96: would you have Insec because of the Lee tech ?
[1:12:23] zazentsuko: KiWiKid?
[1:12:24] Fissiccisst: We should put Dade in the HOF Kappa
[1:12:25] Tazzasaurus: insec for sure
[1:12:34] fx_fanslowika: Mata must get in
[1:12:35] Peris_GR: I havent watch LoL for some years. Is there still a paycheck discrepancy between EU and NA?
[1:12:36] killerwhalekj: pawn
[1:12:38] Naxser: @MonteCristo Dandy?
[1:12:39] fx_fanslowika: before madlife
[1:12:54] phinvincible: Canyon?
[1:13:01] fx_fanslowika: Canyon is still playing
[1:13:04] Fissiccisst: For a non-eastern player, maybe Crumbz?
[1:13:06] balance_cs: Put my boy Maknoon in there
[1:13:06] Quanze_: You think Caps and Jankos have any chances?
[1:13:10] dbowell96: which LPL players do you put in that are retired?
[1:13:14] phinvincible: oh mb mb i thought he retired
[1:13:15] dbowell96: does Clearlove make it
[1:13:17] Kashi_np: Mata is clear
[1:13:18] killerwhalekj: cloud templar
[1:13:26] Fire_elemen6: But you don't score kick
[1:13:27] lyfjabergen: Would Flame be a good pick you think?
[1:13:41] Martakia: Insec had a notable career, not an impactful one to the scale that a hall of fame deserves imo
[1:13:43] phinvincible: have you heard about that business trying to skirt around those twitch korea rules?
[1:13:51] UpYerArs: kc vs madk: battle of the super heavy weight owners
[1:13:53] fx_fanslowika: Caps Jankos Perkz Rekkles all have decent chances to make it
[1:13:56] fatalqwerty: Korea child tech is way too advanced Kreygasm
[1:14:08] Tazzasaurus: so like a mcdonalds play place :D
[1:14:13] Quanze_: flawless
[1:14:14] beluga_12_3: trying to fix their birth rate issues lol
[1:14:16] ddpbr: EZ
[1:14:20] EmbryoVacation: i think anyone that has a League "move" based on them is surely in a Hall of Fame
[1:14:23] phinvincible: SK played great league this week
[1:14:25] fatalqwerty: felt like they capped him with a drive-by
[1:14:31] nickis211: Why do players need to be retired to be in the Hof?
[1:14:37] Fissiccisst: that was clean
[1:14:44] fx_fanslowika: @nickis211 because it should be the culmination of their career
[1:14:55] Martakia: god damn, that was such a clean layering of CC
[1:14:56] fx_fanslowika: we cant judge their career without seeing how it ends no?
[1:14:58] killerwhalekj: is this season going to be another g2 domination

[1:15:25] Banterlife: he doesnt have the BBL (big bard lifestyle)
[1:15:31] Peris_GR: @MonteCristo I havent watch LoL for some years. Does still exist a paycheck discrepancy between EU and NA?
[1:15:43] lyfjabergen: It's so nice seeing good toplane play from EU top's but sadly even out best dont quite stack up internationally
[1:16:11] TastyAMG: There is, EU is just paying more Kappa
[1:16:14] MissingMatter: @nickis211 Most sports do that, I think, although you can come back from retirement. Mario Lemieux comes to mine as an example.
[1:16:16] zazentsuko: if NA were to have won worlds, would  they still be broke?
[1:16:22] TastyAMG: yes
[1:16:29] kerokerogrips: will KC and Mad in LEC, how higher will the average viewership be for the LEC compared to the LCS
[1:16:33] TastyAMG: all except 1 org maybe
[1:16:50] Kashi_np: KC Nisqy in Spring/Summer any %?
[1:16:52] MissingMatter: *comes to mind
[1:17:00] Naxser: @MonteCristo Huni?
[1:17:03] annothemeerkat: Perkz did a really smart thing. Get a big paycheck in NA and then come back to EU to play the best LoL in the West
[1:17:20] Peris_GR: Back in my day NA used to pay more, so a lot of European players would go to US. What happeend?
[1:17:37] Clyde1500: @Peris_GR esports winter happened
[1:17:43] Lemarc7: at this point there's just no coming back for them
[1:17:59] ddpbr: this is a crazy play
[1:18:08] phinvincible: collegiate was supposed to be that, but that was done so poorly its crazy
[1:18:11] Peris_GR: @Clyde1500 what do you mean? Can you elaborate please?
[1:18:13] killerwhalekj: na doesn’t practice
[1:18:16] kerokerogrips: @Peris_GR VC dried up , little ROI for the money spent in the league
[1:18:21] zazentsuko: NA has culture issues
[1:18:23] fatalqwerty: they really burned a lot for nesquicky
[1:18:26] lyfjabergen: It is fascinating seeing the KC and MADKOI fans in the studio, mostly because it teally shows how old the average LoL fan has gotten - actually looks like a football crowd now
[1:18:37] balance_cs: @zazentsuko agreed, no one in NA takes winning seriously
[1:18:52] Quanze_: almost half of LEC this year is from that second tier that was developed
[1:18:58] Clyde1500: @Peris_GR what kerokero said
[1:19:06] phinvincible: was playvs the 3rd party TO back then?
[1:19:09] DoggMcFish: oh thats good to hear
[1:19:37] UpYerArs: wdym KC has the promising 25 year old rookie in Shaken
[1:19:52] rfarleydude97: rfarleydude97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Bro that whole banter saga with KC, KOI, Dom, Yamato, etc is some wild shit I love it! Also do you think Belichick is a good fit for the Falcons? (hoping the Chargers land Harbaugh) ty for the content, cant wait for more on the way from LFN!
[1:20:05] fatalqwerty: they should've stopped believing as early as 2014 tbh LUL
[1:20:07] Wolfmanmoore: Im in NA and I dont watch NA lol
[1:20:12] SESRoots: we will LUL
[1:20:16] Fissiccisst: Schadenfrude conniseurs and people huffing the copium
[1:20:16] killerwhalekj: didn’t TSM say they where moving to tier 1 region
[1:20:23] NadePlaay: Bill is going to Dallas!
[1:20:27] najafan: @fatalqwerty Nah, C9 did decent against SSB
[1:20:27] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[1:20:36] MissingMatter: DSG was probably the most entertaining NA LoL last year.
[1:20:44] kerokerogrips: @killerwhalekj i for one am shocked that regi would lie to us he would never
[1:20:44] EmbryoVacation: he can go to Dallas , Dak will keep choking in the playoffs
[1:20:55] balance_cs: I would watch NA if NA was good. The problem is they are never competitive. If a western team is ever capable of competing they are from EU.
[1:20:57] NadePlaay: Monte, how do you feel about current state of league? i feel like the entire durability patch has been eliminated
[1:21:00] Naxser: @MonteCristo It's hard for me to think of retired players with longevity. The players with more longevity are still playing :v
[1:21:05] rfarleydude97: Theres a story going on that details kinda what happened and it pretty much shows the Titans were petty af
[1:21:30] FloofieBubbleBlower: charger get Harbaugh and vegas gets Belichick. ultimate broncos hell
[1:21:33] rfarleydude97: @EmbryoVacation LMAO true
[1:21:40] lyfjabergen: That one buddy of mine who is a diehard fan of C9 is who watches LCS
[1:21:43] FezFPS: as someone getting into League in 2023, I
[1:21:51] FezFPS: I'd rather just watch LCK and LPL
[1:21:51] Mr_Something__: as a lifelong titans fan, I was GUTTED when I woke up to that headline. Vrabel is easily the best coach the Titans ever had imo
[1:21:54] Clyde1500: OWL FeelsBadMan
[1:21:58] zazentsuko: east coast would smash west coast
[1:21:59] SESRoots: LCS = 3th monitor stream LUL
[1:22:02] kerokerogrips: mid 20's to late 20's millennials who grew up with the game and still havent moved on
[1:22:26] najafan: Doesn't work because like 75% of NA is on the east coast
[1:22:34] UpYerArs: riot killed the amateur scene by not allowing third party tournaments and by the time its too late lmaoo
[1:22:36] zazentsuko: i hide my League of Legends fandom, people look down on it here in NA
[1:22:37] fatalqwerty: jokes on you, I've been an OGN fan since 2012 I have no feelings for NA Kappa
[1:22:45] lyfjabergen: The only reason I watch anything related to LCS is Dom loosing his mind over the quality of gameplay
[1:22:47] Arexcelo: nope I’ve never played league I just like drama :)
[1:22:47] Oraclon: sounds so harsh
[1:22:48] rfarleydude97: @Mr_Something__ he def was! fuck your owner for being a petty daft cunt
[1:22:52] EkyoHots: friends and family
[1:23:00] Dragonslave49: Good old cornfed USA players KKona
[1:23:01] zazentsuko: people who like to spam NA vs EU crap all day
[1:23:08] Clyde1500: I just like the sneaky meteos podcast that's attached to it.
[1:23:12] NadePlaay: all pro leagues in NA have killed the grass roots.. its not even league of legends
[1:23:16] DoggMcFish: and its just so mediocre, theres not even like a couple guys smurfing
[1:23:17] serkaine: Markz will save na lol cope.
[1:23:17] kerokerogrips: for masochists who llke to suffer
[1:23:21] Kashi_np: NA is done, let's just hope C9 can get into LEC in the future.
[1:23:23] phinvincible: the LEC broadcast has been getting worse every year lately not gonna lie
[1:23:23] thund3rdrag0n: also they had terrible schedule last split
[1:23:26] moonweaverr: i cant get excited for tier 2 since NA just recycles all the same bad pros
[1:23:28] SESRoots: watch lcs for the memes :)
[1:23:33] balance_cs: I used to root for NA early on when you might be tricked in to believing that they can pull off an upset, but after like 2015 it was apparent that was never going to happen so it's not fun rooting for something when you know the outcome is disappointment
[1:23:33] phinvincible: the delays, the bad content, LEC fell off hard imo
[1:23:45] killerwhalekj: what about make league combined of eu and na
[1:23:48] UpYerArs: Travis Gafford is watching LCS with a hard chub
[1:24:00] moonweaverr: it helps NA valorant is actually good
[1:24:06] zazentsuko: players cashed out so well
[1:24:21] NadePlaay: that job was a one year and done job anyway feel bad for markZ..
[1:24:35] najafan: And "love me some regi" was a disaster.
[1:24:35] zazentsuko: why does Monte still watch League of Legends??? didn't Riot mess with him too much already?
[1:24:49] Oraclon: NA is the cradle of league of legends so its hard to see the region in this state
[1:24:51] balance_cs: @zazentsuko He really likes the game
[1:24:52] lyfjabergen: How far are we out from them just buying the teams out tho, at some point they will have to take a risk if they want LCS to keep going and the rist nescessaary is getting higher every year basically
[1:24:54] moonweaverr: @zazentsuko 'dont hate the game hate the company that makes it' or something :p
[1:24:55] phinvincible: Even if mark isnt commisioner next year he got brought into the Riot family now so he'll have a different salaried job after
[1:25:00] zazentsuko: @zazentsuko ah ty
[1:25:03] serkaine: Do you think solo queue in NA will trend towards improvement or get worse
[1:25:03] zazentsuko: @zazentsuko ty ty
[1:25:04] Arexcelo: just make a league map in Fortnite and have them play there problem fixed
[1:25:18] RealCheese2: can someone fill me in on what’s going on with na lcs ?
[1:25:28] NadePlaay: do you think developers will ever back off again in the future to allow 3rd parties to handle all comp scenes?>

[1:25:30] zazentsuko: @RealCheese2 investors leaving the scene, less money
[1:25:49] najafan: @NadePlaay Depends on the developer.
[1:26:00] najafan: That's the only answer.
[1:26:03] moonweaverr: @NadePlaay too much money in advertising for the big ones to fully leave, valve is pretty hands off though overall
[1:26:09] RealCheese2: why don’t we just go back to season 3 structure without sponsors
[1:26:12] balance_cs: @serkaine NA will never take solo queue seriously. NA lacks a quality team environment like Monte said, there is too much individuality and not enough team mentality in the scene
[1:26:20] rfarleydude97: cant wait to see the fantastic anti-synergy duo of Humanoid & Razork for another year KEKW
[1:26:22] MissingMatter: Poor voidgrubs don't get the OnKill announcement.
[1:26:27] NadePlaay: valve always has been and have long standing league, but notice very little scene in NA for any valve comp games
[1:26:38] najafan: @balance_cs Basically we're too capitalist and not socialist enough, smh
[1:26:39] lyfjabergen: @RealCheese2 Steadily declinging viewer numbers, stupidly high wages, extremely high costs for facilites etc and sponsors and VC leaving at the same time due to gross neglegence and/or incompetence
[1:26:47] rfarleydude97: he has so far, just hope that keeps up
[1:26:49] EkyoHots: he completely ran it this game though
[1:26:57] rfarleydude97: @EkyoHots that
[1:27:31] Fissiccisst: The Underminer! I am always beneath you, but NOTHING is beneath ME!
[1:27:44] lyfjabergen: He plays like he has the confidence of being the best mid by far, which is nice to watch even if he doesn't seem to be that skill wise
[1:27:46] kAtz124: this r5 rene is looking sus
[1:27:48] balance_cs: First EU game I've watched that a team played well around the objectives
[1:27:58] NadePlaay: is this winter lec?
[1:28:02] Shobes572: oscaranin was the burger getting ate all along
[1:28:10] najafan: When are they bringing back the brawlers alt game mode? That was so much fun.
[1:28:13] moonweaverr: aura holding junglers GIGACHAD real ones remember aegis
[1:28:28] Mr_Something__: @rfarleydude97 bro I’ve not once liked any part of our ownership at any point in history. Every time ownership has changed hands I hold out hope and they’re always pieces of shit lol
[1:28:32] lyfjabergen: SK feels like BDS at the top of their powers last year tbh
[1:28:53] rfarleydude97: @MonteCristo what are your overall thoughts about Voidgrubs from what you've seen and know about them?
[1:29:07] zen__cloud: void grubs are so cool
[1:29:36] fatalqwerty: Thoughts on this new Rift Herald? Feels like a meme tbh
[1:29:43] RawssDeBawss: if only you heard "Gas Gas Gas" by Initial D whenever you were drifting the rift herald
[1:30:09] MissingMatter: @fatalqwerty Between that and those little fires, they seem to want a lot more map mobility.
[1:30:17] RawssDeBawss: unless it's Korean teams, then it's just Monte shouting "All aboard the Korean Hype Train" xD
[1:30:35] rfarleydude97: @Mr_Something__ I feel that, its super egregious when you find out the behind the scenes shit of that whole ideal..

[1:31:33] NadePlaay: were just here cause monte should still be at the desk every week!
[1:31:33] dbowell96: @MonteCristo will powerspike be back in the next few weeks?

[1:32:18] Clyde1500: will dgon's fact of the week ever get a sponsor?
[1:32:24] Naxser: @MonteCristo  HLE or Gen.G what team do you believe would perfom better?
[1:32:38] kerokerogrips: gonna be  interesting to see if dom flames KC players for their performance or nah
[1:32:43] fatalqwerty: What team will choke harder? Kappa
[1:33:10] najafan: How good is Kiin at playing midlane?

[1:33:42] meIIerr: and from those t2 gold difference between oscarinin and irelevant is irelevant now
[1:33:45] RawssDeBawss: I missed most of the hall of fame topic, but just put M5 as a team in there for what we know now about them lmao
[1:34:13] Quanze_: You havent watch Heretics game, right? I actually believe the Toplaners in LEC step up
[1:34:19] pavementzowee: Yeah isma has been playing really well
[1:34:36] balance_cs: I guess we'll find out who was the bigger choker, Peanut or Chovy
[1:34:42] thund3rdrag0n: @MonteCristo why do you think nisqy does really well every time he joins a team, and then always decays
[1:34:45] pavementzowee: I thought Alvaro had a great week too
[1:35:09] najafan: @thund3rdrag0n he doesn't play kled mid
[1:35:13] meIIerr: I saw the inhouses he facilitate the communication a lot
[1:35:32] SESRoots: Nisqy's role reminds me of Hai

[1:37:51] MoldyCalzone: Kreygasm
[1:38:05] Quanze_: Irrelevant was been growing so much over the years
[1:38:06] fx_fanslowika: carzzy and hyli were free too which is crazy
[1:38:09] meIIerr: look at giant basing their whole scouting process on a data, like are they sure their data are not biased in the first place ?
[1:38:30] UpYerArs: hyli has run his course lets be honest here
[1:38:46] Ramister_: why riot like jax so much ?
[1:39:10] balance_cs: Baron + Grubs is insane push
[1:39:13] EkyoHots: @Ramister_ same reason we watched ryze at every worlds for like 7 years
[1:39:44] najafan: Or Ez+Corki for a good period there
[1:39:56] Quanze_: niqsy thought he had flash 100%

[1:41:10] meIIerr: he used it on humanoid before
[1:41:14] Quint_5s: u cant do much with blitz apart from the hook
[1:41:24] serkaine: Is LPL stronger or weaker this year?
[1:41:26] najafan: @luxury_ball DO NOT WISH THAT ON US
[1:41:49] Quanze_: kalista killed renek
[1:41:57] Quanze_: Renata things

[1:42:14] meIIerr: cloud soul is so op on sk
[1:42:17] Elysian_Shine: What are your thoughts on Riot adding a kernal level anticheat for a game that has almost no cheaters? :)
[1:42:17] kerokerogrips: wheres the dmg
[1:42:33] Banterlife: cant wait to watch bin run the lpl this split
[1:42:36] meIIerr: he can r and move away
[1:43:35] Fire_elemen6: It let's him run to the whirling death faster so it kills them sooner on the back swing

[1:43:53] shawnshaunsean: yasinnnn
[1:43:55] Clyde1500: @Elysian_Shine very excited to never play this game again
[1:44:16] Quint_5s: gameplaywise how are the overall changes after watching some of these matches?
[1:44:32] Banterlife: but its funny so :)
[1:44:36] Quanze_: Do you think they will change the support meta? Give some buffs to engage support or something?
[1:44:53] meIIerr: @Quint_5s games have been exciting to watch
[1:45:00] fatalqwerty: watch this new anti-cheat do absolutely nothing against cheaters and make the game lag even more Kappa
[1:45:11] pavementzowee: Oscarintint this game tbh
[1:45:12] najafan: And they're definitely not manipulating what zoomers see to change their geopolitical views to be what the CCP wants. Kappa
[1:45:12] phinvincible: no cheaters? you can buy scripts with a simple google search LUL
[1:45:21] ddpbr: :tf: finally the ward worked
[1:45:34] luxury_ball: I dont like the bushes in the new blue buff area
[1:45:39] kerokerogrips: come to low elo , yuumi and taric bots galore

[1:46:41] meIIerr: G2 rogue was bad
[1:46:50] Arexcelo: as a giants fan seeing the cowboys and eagles choke has been great
[1:46:51] pavementzowee: VIT is impossible to watch without wanting to end it all
[1:46:54] Fire_elemen6: Heretics game is so boring
[1:47:01] kerokerogrips: g2 or TH , vit is sleeper
[1:47:03] whitecrayonlol: Didn't hit play?
[1:47:03] pavementzowee: I agree HRT has been boring
[1:47:11] fx_fanslowika: Heretics play very slow thats true though
[1:47:13] JoJosBizarreLife: Good call considering G2 and Rogue shit all over the stage.
[1:47:39] balance_cs: The VIT game looked like a solo queue game on stream. Not even a professional LOL game
[1:47:58] RottingPunk: this man need a seat LUL
[1:48:18] Fire_elemen6: It's not even that Heretics just play slow, it's their opponents just sit there choosing to slowly bleed out rather than try to fight back.
[1:49:32] zmutekiz: @najafan i mean all the chinese govt wanna know is how many more ahri skins do RAJAT gotta release before it starts hitting a dent in murica's defense budget TriHard TriHard

[2:00:17] kAtz124: i wounder how much does capdad understand the game after watching his son play on stage all the time

[2:02:28] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[2:02:59] Clyde1500: yeah I don't stick around for the desk
[2:03:19] MissingMatter: They can just do all the analyst stuff during the pauses.
[2:03:31] whitecrayonlol: Analyst desk means restroom break for me as well like the audiences on stage
[2:04:03] Shriez: Markoon just a fraction of a second too fast on the engage?
[2:04:05] Elysian_Shine: They need the krepo+monte+doublelift analyst desk to retain viewership
[2:05:04] Naxser: @MonteCristo Without desk segments we didn't have your  secret SKT shirt moment :v
[2:05:56] Itsifi: lcs just needs to get a DJ
[2:06:03] Fire_elemen6: Will LCS have less tech pauses than LEC tho?
[2:06:15] MissingMatter: @Fire_elemen6 Probably not.
[2:06:23] smithpw: LOL Super League SeemsGood
[2:06:44] Respect_Dat1: actually kinda true lol
[2:06:44] whitecrayonlol: True
[2:07:00] WaXMaXter: so youre saying you are esports? LUL
[2:07:04] RawssDeBawss: Monte/Thorin/Dom desk segments would gain viewers xD
[2:07:05] EmbryoVacation: Yeah top 2 would be Dash/Monte
[2:07:09] luxury_ball: I love having varus in the meta
[2:07:14] zazentsuko: PapaSmithy???
[2:07:26] JoJosBizarreLife: Yeah, more or less there needs to be an Inside the NBA level of desk and that isn't feasible.
[2:07:39] nickis211: I think desk segments are really good at events if they have meaningful entertainment like the old world's ones

[2:07:40] whitecrayonlol: Caedrel did good there with the double agent shirt
[2:07:55] Clyde1500: I'm down to listen to sneaky try and figure out monkeys and typewriters between games
[2:07:57] killerwhalekj: traitor meme was fun
[2:08:00] balance_cs: The worlds desk segments were terrible. I watched them, but I didn't feel like they were entertaining in the least
[2:08:00] Goodguygreg18: and it all started with them killing ogn
[2:08:05] JoJosBizarreLife: There's a reason TNT pays those guys a lot of money to run that desk.
[2:08:24] kerokerogrips: except worlds desk killed the traitor skit but leaking caedrels shirt
[2:08:53] Elysian_Shine: In one of Richard Lewis's recent streams he mentions Riot allowing and asking tournament organizers to run events for them in the early days of LoL. Do you think this was a major contributor to the NA scenes success? at least viewership wise
[2:09:03] JoJosBizarreLife: Literally the only analyst desk that anyone watches in like any sport these days.
[2:09:32] JoJosBizarreLife: Yeah, there's no way they can do that, so they need to shift to something else.
[2:09:46] Phaetox: I always assumed the time between games was because of switching the setups out for next players. Was surprised he said they'd just cut it in half
[2:11:18] Phaetox: Elysian I was one of those early TOs and it was. They suddenly cut the RP rewards one year and we lost like half the amateur scene in NA at the time
[2:11:20] Naxser: @MonteCristo Do Faker win more worlds than play professional games with skins?
[2:11:31] smithpw: I hope we get some LCK/LPL poppy games so we can get a deep dives with monte
[2:11:40] Oraclon: wouldnt a compromise be a riot-run fan shop where teams can put their metc (jerseys etc.) on display and get the cut of their sales. could be a link in the client or even with RP
[2:11:47] jellyfishtrain: i hope they have analyst desk at worlds and msi at least
[2:11:49] Oraclon: *merc
[2:11:51] ddpbr: no more audience reactions to meme hovers? weirdChamp
[2:12:13] dah777: whats reason for no skins?
[2:12:13] najafan: iirc it happened twice.
[2:12:23] Shriez: that was the SKT skin line VS Fnatic wasnt it?
[2:12:25] MoldyCalzone: Didn't he do that recently too for an all T1 team?
[2:12:25] EmailmanLOL: he did another recently
[2:12:26] Elysian_Shine: Didn't he just use one at the redbull event?
[2:12:29] EmailmanLOL: so i think 3 so far
[2:12:33] killerwhalekj: kkoma used to be known as riven main I remember
[2:12:34] byonde0n: I believe he has played 4 or 5 games with skins
[2:12:36] ReapersArk: Why doesnt riot force faker to play with skins? Seems like a massive money drain for no reason
[2:12:47] Phaetox: Riot used to provide RP for online tournaments to top 4 teams in bracket but then switched it to only in person tournaments
[2:12:47] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo

[2:13:51] killerwhalekj: I am looking forward to t1 geng banger tomorrow
[2:13:57] Lady_Michaelis: wish they made exodia refrence like krepo more lol
[2:13:58] ggodbody: the most frustrating league to watch the last few years has been LCK because of the breaks between games and then series breaks
[2:13:59] kAtz124: i thought riot said hydra's wave clear was not healthy but look at that jax....
[2:14:14] ggodbody: It's ridiculous and no one can post the VODS but the LCK
[2:14:14] byonde0n: 2016 Faker use his Ryze skin
[2:14:16] balance_cs: It's like Deja Vu, where have I see Larssen geting caught out because he's pushed too far up in lane
[2:14:30] byonde0n: In the finals
[2:14:40] balance_cs: It's been 20 min and he's only used his ult to escape from being too far in lane with no vision
[2:14:54] Elysian_Shine: How well do you think Reginald would be as a lcs co streamer? With occasional guest appearances from previous TSM members like Chaox,Doublelift and Xpecial
[2:15:23] JoJosBizarreLife: @Elysian_Shine About as popular as a kpop band from the early 00s.
[2:15:31] Goodguygreg18: i wonder how many hate views he'd get though
[2:15:33] phinvincible: if I could throw a tomato at Regi for 100$ i'd go broke in a day, he'd be the most successful streamer ever
[2:16:05] hibbjibb: I thought they love them some regi
[2:16:27] phinvincible: Tryndamere was in charge when he said that line LUL he not in charge no more
[2:17:06] Oraclon: aphelios has bad guns every single fight this game...
[2:17:19] zazentsuko: ya that engage was desperation
[2:17:29] zazentsuko: yike throwing
[2:19:34] Goodguygreg18: chicken little needs more fans in the stadium

[2:20:31] whitecrayonlol: G2 playing with no comms or what
[2:20:31] Itsifi: man caps was so bad this game
[2:20:34] Oraclon: i dont want to see caps on neeko anymore, the int is just baked into that champion
[2:20:39] KushD_: show this to people who still act like caps is in peak form every year
[2:21:10] Mannie008: it wasn't enough for caps to die 1v4, he also had to flash and ult
[2:21:10] ReapersArk: Who do you think would win in a 2v2 street fist fight dom + locodoco vs dardoch + piglet
[2:21:46] zazentsuko: phreak did a really good job
[2:22:18] whitecrayonlol: G2 deserves to lose this game with the way they're playing
[2:22:28] Elysian_Shine: Are there any specific teams you wish did a Breaking Point style documentary?
[2:22:34] Haziri_: Haziri_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Love LFN
[2:22:47] Ichigeki1: nli2Sweet sajamDegen
[2:23:10] Goodguygreg18: fnatic too
[2:23:12] serkaine: Have you seen the expanse?
[2:23:16] hibbjibb: The jatt TL
[2:23:18] Mannie008: and flyquest
[2:23:22] Elysian_Shine: Gamecribs, vitality edition. Pure content
[2:23:27] phinvincible: phinvincible subscribed with Prime. 
[2:23:31] JoJosBizarreLife: I think Flyquest wouldn't be all that exciting
[2:23:34] Goodguygreg18: the summer split after yamato took over
[2:23:38] zazentsuko: any team with Dardoch LUL
[2:23:43] phinvincible: o7
[2:23:46] BoonieBones: I read the books but i heard the show was good too
[2:23:54] ReapersArk: Which region would provide the best breaking point documentaries given there is no language barrier
[2:24:03] r1zznizz: Books are also goood!
[2:24:06] RawssDeBawss: Saintvicious vs Elementz drunken argument was hilarious  xD
[2:24:13] r1zznizz: Sad the show is finished though :(
[2:24:15] JoJosBizarreLife: The best timeline is the one where we get a Breaking Point with Forgiven and Dardoch on the same team.
[2:24:22] serkaine: I've seen other scientists fi shows and nothing seemed as good as the expanse
[2:24:29] IEatLamas: Is saintvicious still alive
[2:24:30] phinvincible: *looks at watch* oh its rogue time
[2:24:33] RawssDeBawss: generally curious how they are doing now.
[2:24:36] zazentsuko: @JoJosBizarreLife i feel like they'd get along for a while until one loss breaks them
[2:24:37] Moobot: Follow Monte on Tiktok for breaking news and stream highlights! - https://www.tiktok.com/@ggmontecristo
[2:24:40] JoJosBizarreLife: Just those two angry and the three other players crying in a corner somewhere
[2:24:47] lazink: The Expanse started out as an MMO concept, but they couldn't find the backing, so they turned it into books
[2:25:12] zazentsuko: BrokenBlade was so greedy there
[2:25:16] zazentsuko: flash gone for no reason
[2:25:18] chrisedgeworth: He's literally streaming rn
[2:25:30] stalff: saint streams tft pretty regularly, hes great
[2:25:49] zazentsuko: did Hotshot and Saint ever fistfight?
[2:25:52] IEatLamas: TSM 4 life
[2:26:00] Haziri_: Doesnt drink boxed wine before stream or does he for added entertainment
[2:26:13] IEatLamas: I always liked saintvicious
[2:26:37] Elysian_Shine: I wonder how well old school pros would of done co streaming. Hotshot, saint, Zuna, etc. Sounds like pure content
[2:26:39] JoJosBizarreLife: Always exciting to see a team opt into being the victim of a Hammer and Anvil tactic like that.
[2:27:20] lazink: I remember SaintVicious' natualus play still in all-stars
[2:27:34] ReapersArk: How many fist fights has there been in the league scene even ?
[2:28:20] squirrelnuts077: i miss watching saint stream in his wifebeater and getting drunk talking about navy stories
[2:28:25] JoJosBizarreLife: @ReapersArk Do you count Vasilii?
[2:28:35] Ichigeki1: or latam
[2:28:44] Ichigeki1: id imagine latam could be crazy lol
[2:28:44] Elysian_Shine: How about Gleeb's kill list with locodoco being #1?
[2:28:46] IEatLamas: He had the reginald curse
[2:28:56] Goodguygreg18: thats how bin got his spot Kappa
[2:28:59] AzureCatalyst: I heard about the DontMashMe fistfight
[2:28:59] RawssDeBawss: M5 probably had like 20 fistfights a boot camp xD
[2:29:01] Mannie008: it looked like G2 didn't know how to play their teamcomp that game. They should never win any teamfights against rogue's teamcomp but they never made any plays around Jax so he could try to split push.
[2:29:02] phinvincible: Sword probably gonna tell his grankids he had to fistfight his coach every day for survival
[2:29:03] fatalqwerty: When did the "Quas Incident" happen? LUL in TL?
[2:29:14] zazentsuko: the Vasili incident monkaS
[2:29:19] AzureCatalyst: didn’t mash me mash someone LUL
[2:29:31] RawssDeBawss: judging by what Edward said about having to phone Groove every day to stop fist fights, I can only assume those boot camps were chaos.
[2:29:43] Naxser: @MonteCristo What do you believe would be the role of Kkoma in T1? Because we know that the head coach is Faker :v

[2:29:54] fatalqwerty: @RawssDeBawss mfw M5 was literally fight club LUL
[2:30:10] AzureCatalyst: wasn’t the Quas incident a psychotic break after doing drugs or was that just a rumor
[2:30:13] JoJosBizarreLife: @Naxser Make sure everyone is happy.  That's what your manager at work's job is too.
[2:30:35] RawssDeBawss: @fatalqwerty yeah Groove was basically the one who stopped it basically being Moscow Fight instead of Moscow Five XD
[2:30:36] serkaine: What you think of cvmax
[2:30:46] AzureCatalyst: the league rumors are so wild that im never sure if people are making shit up or if it’s just some sort of fever dream
[2:30:52] SESRoots: Appa Kkoma
[2:30:55] Castlewood: why hello there
[2:31:03] zazentsuko: @AzureCatalyst apparently, most juicy stuff never makes it public
[2:31:14] lazink: Is there an esport that the coach actually has a direct impact in the game?
[2:31:18] zazentsuko: @AzureCatalyst .... if doublelift can help it
[2:31:24] balance_cs: As the only KDF fan alive, I hope so
[2:31:36] AzureCatalyst: @zazentsuko ye but I’ve heard some wild shit from behind the scenes and I’m still not sure if I’m hearing the things lol
[2:31:46] kerokerogrips: battle of mid
[2:31:59] AzureCatalyst: also KDF was apparently rolling C9 in scrims during the worlds boot camp
[2:32:03] fatalqwerty: imagine getting beat by Rogue Kappa
[2:32:14] zen__cloud: why do so many of G2 games over the years look like this?
[2:32:20] AzureCatalyst: that’s not much of an accomplishment but it bodes well for
[2:32:25] killerwhalekj: they were last place last season though. but they have cuzz now so
[2:32:30] fatalqwerty: @zen__cloud It's a cultural thing now LUL
[2:33:40] Iourenco: @MonteCristo do you plan to save the vod of this live?
[2:33:52] MonteCristo: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:33:54] AzureCatalyst: bulldog is my pick for a breakout player
[2:33:57] Mannie008: yeah and kdf beat geng in a scrim recently
[2:34:00] Elysian_Shine: What are your predictions for lcs viewership this year? Will losing tsm have an affect?
[2:34:00] balance_cs: DuDu one of the better top laners in Korea
[2:34:05] Iourenco: thank you!!
[2:34:22] kerokerogrips: Ribgy was praising emnenes more than the others in that interview right?
[2:34:25] AzureCatalyst: he’s poised to really take a big step forward next season with cuz and a stable roster hopefully

[2:45:14] SqueektheWeek: What is this weeks Nerd Legion? still hoping for Blue Eye Samurai @MonteCristo
[2:45:26] VinnyKitty: France being extreamlly salty on twitter was the cherry on top and they wonder why ppl dont like french ppls all banter
[2:45:45] SqueektheWeek: Nice!
[2:45:47] serkaine: Will you do a bangers only stream when t1 faces geng

[2:46:54] VinnyKitty: would you call yourself a good cook
[2:47:16] archie7497: Yeah it's more like South Indian curry; although South Indian curry uses coconut oil more than ghee usually.
[2:47:29] RawssDeBawss: meanwhile am just waiting for the Monte x Riv stream XD

[2:49:17] Loxi9: way to subvert traditional gender roles monte, proud of u ratirlBros
[2:49:44] serkaine: What do you prepare when you want something thats not salty. I only know of fruits and veggies
[2:50:06] whitecrayonlol: Fair enough
[2:50:17] landa94tv: What do you think about the new focus on the nations of the teams? I find the emulating of football fans kind of cringe but at the same time it's a unique vibe
[2:50:45] MadMagical: 1 raiders from MadMagical have joined! 
[2:50:49] annothemeerkat: Yeah, but at home its traditionally the wife that cooks
[2:51:07] Riqui__: massive raid

[2:53:54] Oraclon: no its a skill matchup, perkz is just punishing the rookie
[2:53:58] oODemonPandaOo: i mean, humanoid ran the same matchup and got clapped while playing akali
[2:54:12] archie7497: What do you think about Mrs. Vengeance? Doesn't it feel too stylized? Like the groundedness in the movies goes down in the trilogy
[2:54:19] Oraclon: she is supposed to be way lower
[2:54:37] GPAlexander: I would think the item changes slightly favor akali.
[2:54:44] Lowicz_: Seems like Akali is also good blind pick
[2:54:51] Oraclon: no good trade patterns for her and she has to sustain with fleet under her tower
[2:55:16] imainleesin: TH game 1 just had a doomed earlygame COPIUM
[2:55:25] jerckysminion: jerckysminion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! i am here for bangers only !
[2:55:45] imainleesin: Perkz....
[2:55:46] fx_fanslowika: they said they were insanely cocky going into the mad match
[2:55:48] VinnyKitty: I think on saturday Huminoid played Akali vs azir and KC mid laner got crushed
[2:55:52] fx_fanslowika: decent wake up call
[2:55:59] jerckysminion: damn the dregs of lec :(
[2:56:01] Clyde1500: we have hit the point of banging your head on the wall repeatedly
[2:56:06] VinnyKitty: but again KC midlaner is not preforming well
[2:56:07] Dharpel: so only mash, no bangers?
[2:56:14] oODemonPandaOo: if no one is around to watch the lec banger, is it still a banger
[2:56:22] imainleesin: DIG and IMT are the true banger teams
[2:56:44] jerckysminion: atleast we don't have to watch EG Kappa
[2:56:50] VinnyKitty: What do you think of the LCS changes
[2:56:56] Clyde1500: no 100T games unless they get clapped :)
[2:57:24] jerckysminion: congratz on the kid btw
[2:57:31] Broodshrimp: you should have a counter for how many games where bangers and how many where mash
[2:58:04] VinnyKitty: bard q was nice
[2:58:33] jpegexe: bard into azir ashe is ez mode but still super well played by bard
[2:58:43] archie7497: Monte that should be the least you can do as a bard. It seems watching doss bard really lowered your expectations for bard play

[2:59:27] MissingMatter: I always had fun with Bard.
[3:01:31] MissingMatter: I like how every dragon has a different name in the code.
[3:01:44] archie7497: From the eu inhouses I watched Jackie's doesn't seem like a mage player
[3:02:08] jpegexe: such a smart move to move varus mid while he has no cleanse
[3:02:12] MissingMatter: Probably Elder doesn't, but at this point it honestly wouldn't surprise me if it does.
[3:02:26] imainleesin: Wunder poppin off
[3:02:31] MissingMatter: This one was "Earth" and Cloud was "Air"
[3:03:00] MissingMatter: Yeah, most likely
[3:03:29] MissingMatter: Also amusing they managed to break the reports for them, but the grubs and stuff report fine
[3:03:32] Glaciren: are you still in korea?
[3:03:41] PapaSmithy: monte watching the 4th best region FailFish

[3:04:30] Bt125000: What are your thoughts on void grubs ?
[3:04:32] Clyde1500: who is flyquest playing? I have no idea what the lcs schedule is.
[3:04:50] PapaSmithy: any number is sacred
[3:04:51] jerckysminion: i hope those millions of viewers are not all bots like previously Kappa
[3:05:08] Clyde1500: it's just me and my millions of alt accounts
[3:05:12] PapaSmithy: Shopify Rebellion and Immortals
[3:05:16] MissingMatter: With the new herald/grubs and the busted damage items, games probably ought to end faster.
[3:05:33] Bladetykon: time to check the league client for some imbeded streams
[3:05:39] PapaSmithy: we will slap down the business to business peer software and the fake mibr

[3:07:03] Clyde1500: does 100T have any good players? I know snipars is hyped up but he's a rookie.
[3:07:17] Glaciren: Do you think LCS play will be higher with fewer teams and more concentrated talent?
[3:07:23] MissingMatter: If they fucked off forever they could play vs TSM
[3:07:23] Oraclon: noooo, not the hoodies!
[3:07:26] PapaSmithy: -100t +LOUD and im happy
[3:07:47] jerckysminion: -100T + duncan's random discord people
[3:07:59] Bt125000: Just merge LCS
[3:08:04] TJ_Angel: ++ this idea
[3:08:10] archie7497: @papasmithy oh so you want brazillian kc/koi

[3:09:12] addaberry: @Clyde1500 River is pretty good, and Meech has some academy hype. But otherwise looks pretty dire
[3:09:17] PapaSmithy: 🤔
[3:09:22] jerckysminion: like didn't they legit have 2.1 billion $ worth in skin sales?
[3:09:42] Clyde1500: @addaberry oh yeah river. I knew they replaced closer with somebody decent but couldn't remember.
[3:10:04] WaXMaXter: maybe buy a number of teams a year before consolidation without telling people Kappa Kappa
[3:10:11] PapaSmithy: make it a 15 team with relegation y1 then or something

[3:11:11] Aoyos_: Just go full European league, 16-20 teams with relegation for a while
[3:11:34] Fissiccisst: Ok here's what you do: You just release LoL2, declare a new league, and make teams buy in again, then trim there. Won't piss of anyone
[3:11:41] noyea96: Where would you rank Heretics in EU monte?
[3:11:57] archie7497: @papasmithy can they even add teams? Wouldn't that devalue their slot?
[3:12:18] Clyde1500: @Fissiccisst riot just needs another scandal and they can copy blizzards homework.
[3:12:37] Glaciren: how high do you think their ceiling is then?
[3:12:39] Fissiccisst: @Clyde1500 except noone actually got in trouble at either company for their scandals
[3:12:51] MissingMatter: @Clyde1500 I don't think Tencent would sell them to Microsoft though
[3:13:13] Clyde1500: no like OW2 you announce LOL 2 to distract people from the scandal

[3:28:00] stalff: @serkaine he knows everyone in the scene?!
[3:28:11] Stozypokes: I love that you are enjoying league again Monte

[3:29:17] Joaz: did you see the pre game tweet from kcorp to ibai? youve had more mergers than throphies?
[3:29:30] Kharadus: @Bt125000 I know it sounds surreal, scary even

[3:30:44] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:31:11] Bt125000: @Kharadus it's not a fantasy, there are cases where the sources don't want bad things happening to them
[3:31:32] Joaz: also the KC v MDK game got more views than any lec game in the last 4 years, including finals
[3:31:41] imainleesin: Sheo??
[3:31:56] Joaz: 740 escharts
[3:32:01] archie7497: Wtf did vto do for nuc to have time to dive bot as azir?
[3:32:04] fljqpy: finals are always g2 vs fnc who cares
[3:32:35] imainleesin: NotLikeThis
[3:33:25] Kharadus: @Bt125000 I was  being sarcastic, or trying anyway, guess I'm too tired to convey it at this early of an hour
[3:33:36] Joaz: last 3 years,Summer 2021- 842,976 peak was higher

[3:36:36] Joaz: @fljqpy MDK tweeted after their first win : looks like shit
[3:36:38] zen__cloud: rumble trade pattern looks so toxic
[3:36:47] Joaz: to taunt dom
[3:37:09] fljqpy: gotta farm those
[3:38:13] Joaz: @fljqpy engagement on the tweets were insane, lots of 500k+ views
[3:38:39] fljqpy: SeemsGood
[3:39:03] zen__cloud: my eyes
[3:39:14] archie7497: Mate this game is such a tragedy. Legit a comp of rakam ori and rumble j4 didn't 5v5 engage a teamfight the whole game
[3:39:15] imainleesin: what is that glitch? lmao
[3:39:15] Bladetykon: what was that?
[3:39:23] Joaz: @zen__cloud tried closing them ?
[3:39:44] zen__cloud: @Joaz i'm asian, i gotta work on the opposite
[3:39:49] Fissiccisst: shade issue when the dragon effect activates on the map @Bladetykon
[3:39:55] Fissiccisst: shader*
[3:39:57] Joaz: @zen__cloud LUL
[3:40:10] fljqpy: imagine needing to use 2 skill to have a knockup LUL j4 is so old
[3:40:11] archie7497: Hexplate j4 is so dogshit
[3:40:30] fljqpy: meanwhile belveth
[3:40:47] kayyslol: kayyslol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! hows it goin monte
[3:40:51] kAtz124: nah....that item is a bait
[3:41:20] archie7497: Imagine if daglas didn't waste his flash midlane.

[3:41:22] kayyslol: Just finished my commercial license, working on instructor -- well leaving the teamside but ya
[3:41:27] kayyslol: for the better
[3:41:57] kayyslol: Been working on it for 1.5yrs while on Vitality
[3:42:06] archie7497: They don't wombo combo once the whole game lmao
[3:42:30] kayyslol: Umm so far I like the changes -- the new map / baron changes will add to the varrying setups
[3:42:50] zen__cloud: xin is so good this patch
[3:43:10] kayyslol: Once they balance the items some will be better - but yea been a long time working on it
[3:44:02] archie7497: Why are vitality even there? What are they fighting over? Why is no one farming sidelane?
[3:44:22] plasmaunit: I think that's to be expected with a big shake up. It makes the game so much more interesting even as a casual playing solo Q
[3:45:08] imainleesin: only hyli knows
[3:45:47] Bladetykon: list what if they have hidden a 6th team mate down there and that team mate wanted to flank
[3:47:31] d_kowalski: This is exactly the Carzzy-Hyli lane we expected last year

[3:47:41] archie7497: Ahh it's so tilting to watch this game. How is vitality not able to play a cookie cutter engage comp
[3:48:56] archie7497: There isn't one single wombo the whole game
[3:49:16] moolamba: This is..wow
[3:49:27] Fissiccisst: I GET IT
[3:49:39] Fissiccisst: dolphinYay
[3:50:09] noyea96: vetheo seems to only be able to play good on lesser teams, but is invisible in better lineups
[3:51:50] Fissiccisst: Xin is what I wish Pantheon was lol

[3:54:28] Fissiccisst: is rumble ult still like a 60s cooldown?
[3:54:36] Bladetykon: have we seen a rumble ult yet?
[3:55:04] AzureCatalyst: you’re watching what the kids call a banger
[3:55:06] archie7497: @noyea96 its more like he plays good with junglers who babysit him. He looked good with razork/zanzahrah/ jankos. He looked shit with xerse who farms and daglas who seems to focus more on counter jungling and fucking up the enemy jungler
[3:56:22] fljqpy: LEC needs to be 8 teams LUL
[3:56:28] imainleesin: poor Carzzy
[3:57:19] imainleesin: this Daglas guy seems kinda sus
