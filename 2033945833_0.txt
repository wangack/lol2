[0:40:31] CouchyHOTS: wait so cubby is confirmed not on LCS? :(
[0:40:42] lllove11: Like....
[0:40:47] SwedeBeGoode: @notevenstevenn instructions are in the rules channel
[0:40:58] ur_a_rock: @shoototroll ?
[0:41:03] ProteusWest: do you think the Player's Association would be okay with throwing players at fans?
[0:41:24] SwedeBeGoode: @proteuswest like bowling?
[0:41:36] SwedeBeGoode: I'd watch that
[0:41:42] ProteusWest: well, he said pitching, so I was thinking overarm
[0:41:43] imshades: Into fans? Let the crowd decide if the float or fall
[0:41:54] ProteusWest: but it'd probably have to be softball tosses with bigger players like Fudge
[0:42:00] womboboys: Now you just chuck 3's as fast as you can
[0:42:00] Krischian: !discord
[0:42:00] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[0:42:05] 1DeepBlue: the forward pass didn't use to exist in football
[0:42:05] gurg7: baseball literally just implemented rules that drastically just changed the viewing experience and the MLB has existed since like 1901 lol
[0:42:12] VerbalHorse: Bro that was like in 1954
[0:42:22] VerbalHorse: Not showing the scoreboard is caveman shit
[0:42:24] ErianDH: 3pt shot is another big one
[0:42:39] womboboys: 70s barely showed the scoreboard in NFL games. And it's better. Lost vomit everywhere.
[0:42:41] historyofthegreatwar: Remember when they didn't have inhibitor respawn timers?
[0:42:43] Paulo_Ai: The imports in Nba are good
[0:42:51] endercasts: "challenging convention" Mark Riot
[0:42:59] nizzy2k11: @theemarkz when we couldn't see ward/item CDs on the scoreboard.
[0:43:05] aequorin628: @VerbalHorse "remember when there was 25 minutes in between games" feels like it could be on that level tbh
[0:43:08] Ristow: let's talk about the greatest sports viewing addition... the blue circle around the puck in the NHL
[0:43:09] WardenWinter: @endercasts like not wearing suits, right?
[0:43:16] lllove11: Can we ban the top 5 most picked champs from the past week? It'd be great to introduce more champs to the pro scene.
[0:43:18] endercasts: exactly

[0:43:27] shinwinter: @MacDaAce When the LEC face a great enemy, they raise an army to fight.
[0:43:43] ProteusWest: do they still have a circle around puck in the NHL? I actually watched it when they highlighted it and then they took it away
[0:43:47] DonNardo: I watched the interview, did mark say what the teams are able to do between champ select and the start of the game?
[0:43:53] nfcpm: it was odd the the LEC casters didn't watch any CQ.
[0:44:01] JampireM: when does lec switch to next patch?
[0:44:10] VerbalHorse: So far everything MArkZ had changed has been a big W, if he does BO3 they should make him commissioner for life

[0:45:15] Kikelomaster: markz is the GOAT GoatEmotey
[0:45:15] bellucs: I feel like a dynasty is what makes fans connect to players. Bjerg and DL were loved mostly due to being winners and were mostly always competitive. There doesn't really feel like there are players that are going to replace that any time soon. C9 should be that, but they are consistently underperforming when it matters.

[0:46:09] ProteusWest: @bellucs when does it matter? if it's international, then Bjerg and DL aren't exactly paragons of competitiveness

[0:47:57] a_blue_snivy: east coast>>>
[0:48:04] aequorin628: Bruh it's not possible, we can't just artificially create fanbases like that
[0:48:04] WardenWinter: @endercasts speaking from personal experience right there.
[0:48:06] Noreason_4: nobody cares about TL or C9 or 100 anymore
[0:48:06] iamelvis4: who follows KOI
[0:48:07] JampireM: we dont watch games during the week
[0:48:10] DavidSzajnuk: East Coast Beast Coast

[0:48:29] DavidSzajnuk: @endercasts would take years
[0:48:30] Noreason_4: @endercasts we cant we have no fanbase
[0:48:34] VerbalHorse: For NA oyu can have a BIden team and a Trump team then the fans will hate each other

[0:50:55] WitheredxRose: just do what val does and combine north and south america
[0:50:57] the1andonlycorbin: NA vs LatAm vs Brazil could be interesting, like a preseason tourney or something
[0:50:58] Wehs: it sounds like a rivalry developed from the teams themselves rather than the league
[0:51:00] yeshua705: Let's go
[0:51:03] Azikielboi: @endercasts yeah we need that
[0:51:05] JampireM: imt has tried to own the midwest and it just DOESNT work

[0:51:26] Game8910: The only way to pull it off is to merge with LLA and CBLOL
[0:51:26] Red2851: if team sponsored content creators talk trash more often that’s probably as close as we can get, but that can get very annoying very quickly

[0:52:54] magillagorilla4sale: Get Moist and DSG in the league imo
[0:53:08] Red2851: we’ve seen the hype cblol in particular can generate at worlds and at the arena show match, if we can harness their fans and energy it could help

[0:53:36] lec_airport_speedrun: @balloonanimalsandhorses wouldn't have said stole, Ibai bought MRS too and just moved them up to MAD in the LEC
[0:53:44] ThexCatmanx: @iamelvis4 Cause Nisqy is that good
[0:53:48] boba_bunbun: more creator owned orgs like DSG

[0:54:11] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[0:54:18] shinwinter: @boba_bunbun this one is mostly possible
[0:54:24] Krepo: Maybe valorant should buff jett
[0:54:43] Azikielboi: i think thats being too scared, u cant be scared of the creators being larger than the main broadcast
[0:54:46] ThexCatmanx: @Krepo Sounds like a good plan
[0:54:50] maverin116: short term viewership boost
[0:55:01] ShadeCloud: need the Team Liquid Doublelift's to take on the TSM Bjerg's
[0:55:01] boba_bunbun: 100k ibai
[0:55:08] JeroamThePI3: champs I’m pretty sure Tarik had like 100k while valorant main had like about half of that
[0:55:12] Game8910: Ibai alone had like 230k viewers for that game
[0:55:16] sneakydeek: ibai hit 200k

[0:55:19] Krepo: 170k kammeto
[0:55:23] Krepo: 100+ ibai
[0:55:24] PapaSmithy: when kc game starts, 100k extra people join kameto's costream vs. his viewership of other games
[0:55:29] j_tripper: when do sponsors become privy to the fact that co-stream views as they exist do nothing for their advertising?
[0:55:32] maverin116: but can a sports league survive if it is dependent on internet personalities?
[0:55:32] yanya7701: 200k wtf
[0:55:33] PapaSmithy: so thats 100k extra french viewers for each kc bo1
[0:55:34] shinwinter: xdd
[0:55:43] fearfactor_25: get MR beast vs Toast teams
[0:55:44] VerbalHorse: They are successfully leveraging Ibai tbh, Ibai will pull crazy numbers regardless what he streams, better he stream league than not for LEC
[0:55:49] JeroamThePI3: Having Ibai costream LEC or league in general is huge
[0:55:52] Krepo: but most importantly SK is 3-0
[0:55:59] zashezi: @fearfactor_25 W take
[0:56:12] LSF_Frog: LCS needs OTK
[0:56:12] PalavenLoL: the TFT cup this last weekend had bigger co-streams than main broadcast

[0:56:18] LSF_Frog: LCS needs OTK to buy a team
[0:56:19] womboboys: views = who cares. tell me revenue.
[0:56:21] Darwking: East vs west
[0:56:22] lllove11: @theemarkz make sure the CO streamers aren't just shit talking the LCS the entire time.  Make the partners that promote the league instead of trash talking it the entire time.
[0:56:29] imshades: Idk why costreams exist. Do they pay for the rights? It's like allowing someone stream a opening showing of a film for free to everyone they know.
[0:56:31] shinwinter: @fearfactor_25 VS Tyler1 team LUL  tell him to make one
[0:56:33] TheRealDivert: get  em on broadcast. summit1G special guest
[0:56:35] endercasts: u literally need famous org owners to have beef
[0:56:35] WitheredxRose: @fearfactor_25 mr beast, T1, Toast, and moist
[0:56:37] Aerohydrous: What about a system like Liquid+? That’d be dope for LCS
[0:56:39] Haru928: Haru928 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[0:56:39] profitguru: @LSF_Frog Appropriate username
[0:56:41] Azikielboi: we have OTK, mr. beast, offline TV @travisgafford ?
[0:56:43] endercasts: like pay nadeshot to talk mad shit about jack
[0:56:46] Azikielboi: yeah there u go exactly
[0:56:48] dropsofliquid: Do you think there are any NACL fans who don't watch LCS?
[0:56:54] aequorin628: Hot take: people overstate how big getting DSG in LCS would be MASSIVELY. Toast is literally like 50x less popular than Kamet0 in terms of viewers.
[0:56:57] Cubbyxx: Drive to Survive LCS pitch @endercasts
[0:57:00] Stealthm3lon: @PapaSmithy Beef with some other GMs
[0:57:02] nizzy2k11: scarra's back boys
[0:57:02] endercasts: SOLD
[0:57:08] HippoSquirrel: @endercasts Wait. I love this idea. Get famous rappers into the Esports Ownership game.
[0:57:09] CouchyHOTS: @endercasts nadeshot needs a relevant roster for that to matter 💀
[0:57:11] Azikielboi: DO IT
[0:57:11] brosciencegym: toadphHmm toadphHmm toadphHmm asmun he is AsMON
[0:57:12] Cyanteal: annytfBedge
[0:57:16] endercasts: HOLY SHIT @CouchyHOTS
[0:57:19] endercasts: YOU DIDNT
[0:57:21] maverin116: I don't want my league to become a drama league between creators. Sounds crazy toxic
[0:57:25] Todo88: LCS Drive to Survive would be sick as hell
[0:57:27] Darwking: Yes pls copy drive for survive this
[0:57:28] iamelvis4: OTK would never, they have said they think esports isn't worth it
[0:57:28] bizdgil: 100p
[0:57:28] VerbalHorse: Getting personalities into LCS is almost necessary at this point, where else are viewers coming from
[0:57:40] Avvura: Hard Knocks but for LCS
[0:57:45] Avvura: LUL
[0:57:53] jdc009: they're huger than huge yup
[0:57:56] KopecLoL: @endercasts he's not wrong who even has a good roster besides C9 XDD
[0:57:56] brosciencegym: OTK is LCS is a big NO, Asmon would not approve
[0:57:59] DUKEFNT24: nice shirt @Cubbyxx
[0:58:04] WitheredxRose: just fuse lcs with latm and cblol
[0:58:05] tiberiusjesus: drive to survive brought in fans for f1 that had never watched f1 before
[0:58:05] BalloonHorses: @Avvura I would love another team liquid breaking point lol
[0:58:06] Binomis: OH YEA MOIST, OTK, OTV teams I need it
[0:58:07] jdc009: omega whales
[0:58:12] Cubbyxx: Had to make the guest that's never been on HLL before comfy @DUKEFNT24
[0:58:12] profitguru: The LCS has QT Cinderella!
[0:58:13] Azikielboi: OTK and OTV have similar size
[0:58:16] yanya7701: @maverin116 its the only way to keep the two western leagues relevant bc you just get constantly stomped by LPL and LCK and that drives down viewership and following
[0:58:17] lady_empire: lady_empire subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! <3
[0:58:18] Shiny_Froakie: @KopecLoL Flyquest, TL, NRG to name a few
[0:58:20] Game8910: You need creators that are bigger than just the league ecosystem
[0:58:21] Thirty76: you can't shut down costreams, ever, anymore. younger viewers don't want to watch the official broadcast
[0:58:30] JordanXO: basically they are huge celebritys from where they are from
[0:58:36] Xenex15: I don't think OTK/OTV would bring in comparable viewers to MADK/KC tbh but it'd help that's for sure.
[0:58:37] skaels: North America vs South America?
[0:58:40] Azikielboi: @Thirty76 this
[0:58:42] Krepo: he's not wrong
[0:58:48] dropsofliquid: So who is like that in NA
[0:58:48] Krepo: markz smart egg
[0:58:53] nfcpm: you need a Hololive vs. Ninjisanji teams or dub vs. subs teams
[0:58:56] maverin116: the team would have to be removed in some way from the influencer
[0:59:01] shinwinter: @brosciencegym after he watch a latest League cinematic he might changed his mind LUL
[0:59:04] jbomb___: i think its all like a cultural thing, each region has a different shtick, korea has appeals to skill for fandom, europe has appeals to region, i think the NA itch is scratched by personality / creators
[0:59:10] d0ugh_thedarkness: You think there can ever be a point where there are no casters and only CO streams?
[0:59:14] VerbalHorse: Disguised would watch DSG every game for sure, think other creators would co-stream as well iff they had a team
[0:59:17] riskydevils: riskydevils subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 2 month streak!

[0:59:27] DUKEFNT24: @Cubbyxx that shirt with Mark's face will take LCS out of poverty
[0:59:28] yanya7701: HUH
[0:59:30] Azikielboi: kpop??
[0:59:31] Azikielboi: HUH

[0:59:55] a_large_farvaaaa: team cubby vs world
[1:00:00] paarthos: Day where esport was nearer to traditional sport
[1:00:10] Avvura: Depends on the team
[1:00:11] Ian7j2: Yeah fuck the cowboys
[1:00:11] dv9r: is that true?
[1:00:12] DavidSzajnuk: ask cowboys fans
[1:00:13] shewasabulldozer: bad take. kpop style fandom adds passion & positivity that contrast with the disappointments of older trad fans
[1:00:13] Todo88: F1 is very much like that
[1:00:15] Azikielboi: "they didnt deserve it BabyRage "
[1:00:18] Avvura: Lets go Lions
[1:00:19] cozycoffin_: True
[1:00:22] DavidSzajnuk: AMEN\
[1:00:22] stizzle_swick: Assholes are better for fandoms?
[1:00:24] DavidSzajnuk: lol
[1:00:25] Game8910: League fans are not toxic enough I agree
[1:00:26] zashezi: nahhhhhhhh
[1:00:26] maverin116: the G2 model makes a lot more sense than DSG right now
[1:00:26] Xenex15: @Cubbyxx BIG agree.
[1:00:27] Thirty76: that's a cope
[1:00:27] profitguru: Hate watching sports teams is a real thing
[1:00:27] hahwinner: LUL how bout the LIONS!
[1:00:28] cozycoffin_: COWBOYS SUCK
[1:00:33] zashezi: fake bears fan
[1:00:33] Krepo: hate watching is goated
[1:00:35] ezio___________: nah rather see packers lose
[1:00:36] bizdgil: GO LIONS
[1:00:39] Paulo_Ai: Is LCS  ready to bring Dominate in ?
[1:00:40] Dethrey: when the Detriot lions won their first playoff game in 32 years. their fans are partying like its 1969. its called class
[1:00:42] kerokerogrips: I think we see our first league fist fight in the LEC studio this split
[1:00:43] maverin116: an influencer is the face but can be removed and the team can survive without them
[1:00:43] profitguru: Watching TSM explode was so cathartic
[1:00:44] Krepo: i love watching french teams go 0-3
[1:00:44] Azikielboi: xpp ddx xdd
[1:00:45] MacDaAce: LUL the cowboys
[1:00:45] the1andonlycorbin: FTP , FTB, FTV, Let's Go Lions!
[1:00:46] KopecLoL: @Cubbyxx SEEING THE DOLPHINS LOSE IS THE BEST
[1:00:48] Dethrey: and im not a lions fan
[1:00:51] tony220jdm: Up to ORGs to make effort to make a fan base tho
[1:00:54] ezio___________: im Vikings fan would rather see GB lose
[1:00:56] cozycoffin_: I LOVED WATCHIING TSM LOSE
[1:00:56] womboboys: youngest team in the league beating dumbest team in league
[1:00:57] nocturnavi: Honestly part of the reason I like esports is because there's less hatewatching
[1:00:57] kageramen: LETS GO PACKERS
[1:01:05] Binomis: TSM WONNERED will always live on in my heart
[1:01:05] imshades: Hatewatchers are 80% of subs. The only hate ads more. Farm them.
[1:01:08] Avvura: @KopecLoL thats easy they do it every year sadge
[1:01:10] Azikielboi: RIPBOZO rolled and smoked @travisgafford
[1:01:11] endercasts: joever
[1:01:14] MacDaAce: Imagine being a cowboys fan
[1:01:15] nfcpm: But Travis got MTG
[1:01:16] Todo88: LUL
[1:01:18] j_tripper: clip it
[1:01:23] Azikielboi: yeah u got MTG travis
[1:01:31] jbomb___: not only did he not apply, he applied once wait actually TWICE
[1:01:34] Shiny_Froakie: That damn Jackie intentionally blocked Travis from getting the job
[1:01:38] yanya7701: wait you applied for commissioner?
[1:01:45] NahDawgDatAintMe: I heard you offered to pay them
[1:01:45] jbomb___: I heard travis applied 3 times
[1:01:45] Noreason_4: lcs cant get viewers like kc or koi  they need to get people excited another way and i dont know what that could be
[1:01:50] iamelvis4: Is that how it works?
[1:01:52] maverin116: hatewatching and drama farming is definitely very positive and healthy for the long-term growth of the league
[1:01:55] scaf6: There is a certain league related person who said that
[1:01:57] Krepo: but they also didnt say yes?
[1:01:59] deekomode: LUL
[1:02:01] iamelvis4: MarkZ please hire me
[1:02:05] HippoSquirrel: Why would it even matter if Travis applied?!?!?
[1:02:11] endercasts: @iamelvis4 no hire me pls :)
[1:02:14] bii_bella: oh so that means you applied for the job? /s
[1:02:20] Sanlux: both
[1:02:20] JeroamThePI3: One rumour
[1:02:21] Azikielboi: let us sit in ur chair
[1:02:22] Paulo_Ai: THE only one that can save NA is QTPIE
[1:02:23] amagikarpp: MarkZ is the hottest commissioner
[1:02:26] dropsofliquid: Do you have a nice chair tho
[1:02:32] a_large_farvaaaa: Hire ender for wardrobe
[1:02:38] yanya7701: omg it is so cold today
[1:02:47] imshades: @paulo_ai crumpPlus
[1:02:49] LSF_Frog: OTK, C9, Tyler1, OTV, XQC teams is how we can save LCS
[1:02:56] NahDawgDatAintMe: 🇨🇦
[1:02:59] numiiigoesrawrz: take: there was a previous mark take with pro patch being 2 weeks behind affects team practice. have any teams/players reached out to Mark as commissioner with pro play being on live patch now?
[1:03:01] Shiny_Froakie: @endercasts Vouch. Ender makes toxic EU fans uncomfy, which is a perfect asset to NA, EU's kryptonite as of Worlds last year
[1:03:02] stevemcgooch: Will ender be handling markZ wardrobe for all official events?
[1:03:14] OMNlSCI3NCE: @lsf_frog you forgot the Mr. Beast team

[1:03:47] dropsofliquid: Oh nvm I see it pinned
[1:03:48] CouchyHOTS: o7 mark
[1:03:59] profitguru: @dropsofliquid Did teams or players ask to move to the live patch
[1:04:38] imshades: crumpSweat crumpSweat crumpSweat
[1:04:45] endercasts: what if lcs was played on the internal development patch? so that lcs fans could see champions that wont release for like 8 months? that would convince me to tune in :)
[1:05:12] gurg7: NACL always matched LCS
[1:05:17] gurg7: and still are, just live patching now
[1:05:27] yanya7701: Travis just admit you never watch NACL
[1:05:42] travisgafford: I don't NEVER watch NACL
[1:05:44] JChongg: watch more nacl pls
[1:05:48] JeroamThePI3: oh there’s a rumour that NACL won be broadcasted is that true? because it conflicts with LCS times
[1:05:50] travisgafford: I just don't normally and when I do it's often just on a second screen
[1:05:53] VerbalHorse: The biggest problem with live patch is some crazy game breaking bug happening or people abusing a bug on a champ
[1:05:57] JeroamThePI3: won’t*
[1:05:58] Whoopley: im gonna convert travis to be the biggest NACL fan, just u watch
[1:06:05] KenBC: Does the fact the Pros are playing on live change the date when the patch drops?
[1:06:06] JChongg: @Whoopley W
[1:06:09] endercasts: @VerbalHorse those exist on old patches too
[1:06:10] travisgafford: can't do that if you never see me @Whoopley
[1:06:16] endercasts: but theres a list of banned interactions
[1:06:19] endercasts: so pros cant abuse that
[1:06:19] ImGriffon: Kappa i watch the NACL
[1:06:21] KaelinTV: Let's be honest, we need promotion relegation between the LCS and NACL. NACL just doesn't matter in the eyes of most. We have two slots open in LCS, summer is the perfect time to enter some stakes and shake things up.
[1:06:22] slvrmsmackenzie: @whoopley please do
[1:06:22] Prophet181: NACL casters are goated
[1:06:25] Whoopley: @travisgafford MTG next when
[1:06:31] nfcpm: i like that NA will be in front of the meta rather than just copying others
[1:06:36] MacDaAce: @travisgafford you think you will watch NACL now that it comes after LCS? I think I will be watching more
[1:06:39] gurg7: HahaSweat
[1:06:48] DINOWAAA: hire Vandrill
[1:06:51] colesworthy: will new champs still be locked out for a time period like it seems previously occurred?
[1:07:03] nfcpm: LEC did not use hotfix
[1:07:19] yanya7701: @nfcpm sure Kappa
[1:07:25] JeroamThePI3: lmao LCS hire Vandrill he’ll do it all
[1:07:34] Thirty76: @KaelinTV couldn't agree more
[1:07:41] a_large_farvaaaa: does commish make over or under tree fiddy
[1:07:43] Grenadier08: so is Riot hiring a bunch of new QA then with this change?
[1:08:21] DonNardo: would worlds be better if it was every year or like the World Cup or the Olympics?

[1:08:37] JChongg: cant wait to watch dsg perry and dsg minui
[1:08:41] Noreason_4: the 5 hihgest viewed nacl games were disguised games
[1:08:48] MacDaAce: trying out the new tech
[1:08:56] KaelinTV: @Thirty76 Indeed. It will also kick the LCS teams into high gear, no more sitting and just collecting paychecks doing the bare minimum. If the lower tier teams leave, good riddance, If you aren't helping the league develop further, you shouldn't be in it..period...
[1:09:28] MacDaAce: Aye Suns ran that meta
[1:09:33] braydi__: 7-seconds

[1:09:37] HippoSquirrel: I don't know what the significance of 8 seconds is. I don't play hockey.
[1:09:43] Thirty76: Esports should always be on live patch
[1:09:51] imshades: So much time & effort to have an org tho
[1:10:08] AsheOfAx: TSports are always played on current patch
[1:10:13] AsheOfAx: i don't see what the big deal is
[1:10:26] Thirty76: it's the one thing that esports can have that will always be better than traditional sports

[1:11:26] LateNiteArc: @markz is the script real?
[1:11:39] frozenturdx: MarkZ THE GOAT 🐐
[1:11:50] ProteusWest: I think if you get NACL more viewership and more interest, then it'd be a lot easier to sell Valorant style promotion publicly

[1:12:39] Relise_lol: bjerg deserves it
[1:12:39] ProteusWest: just put Imaqtpie in there
[1:12:40] nizzy2k11: by that metric why are we letting anyone in not from KR?
[1:12:41] MacDaAce: nah
[1:12:42] dv9r: wow this is one of the worst takes I've heard on HLL
[1:12:43] reisifel: not all champions in UFC are in the hall of fame
[1:12:46] PenguinBuddy15: bjerg gets in
[1:12:46] cozycoffin_: NA GOATS ARE NOT ACUTALLY GOATS
[1:12:46] yanya7701: DL never made it out of groups ever

[1:12:49] PapaSmithy: doublelift for sure should be in based on 2010-2012
[1:12:50] zerovisible: what a stupid take nobody is arguing against this
[1:12:50] AsheOfAx: VoyBoy deserves it
[1:12:55] Cyanteal: The Pie?
[1:12:56] MacDaAce: Lies and slander
[1:12:59] AngelHorror: he is not right
[1:13:02] zprotato: @yanya7701 2019 MSI ?
[1:13:04] cozycoffin_: NA GOATS ARE NOT REALLY GOATS

[1:13:17] Todo88: Frank Gore type beat
[1:13:17] Ian7j2: I don't think ppl should get in for longevity
[1:13:18] yanya7701: @zprotato MSI is not group stage
[1:13:19] pinkmagetv: tbh I started in 2011 and I agree
[1:13:19] kerokerogrips: amazing with years of exp ahead of the east NA couldnt reach the highs of eastern teams
[1:13:22] mithrilblue: only 4 chips in a row
[1:13:22] cozycoffin_: long standing does not MEAN BEST IN ROLE
[1:13:23] BalloonHorses: I think they should get in just based off of legacy
[1:13:24] sirtakalot: DL transfer to TSM got on ESPN front page
[1:13:25] Ian7j2: That makes a hall of fame lame

[1:14:05] JChongg: dl def had one of the biggest influences over league as a whole
[1:14:06] bizdgil: fake man?>

[1:14:17] ThexCatmanx: Insec should be the first inductee, in my opinion
[1:14:18] janova: DL/Bjerg were both considered internationally competitive, DL especially was well respected by early asian players even players like Prince
[1:14:19] MacDaAce: When Bjerg gets respect from Faker?
[1:14:19] DonNardo: will I get to visit it like coopers-town?
[1:14:20] kccaseyyy: aphromoo is in the running then if we're letting in DL nad bjerg

[1:14:41] whoa2you: In terms of the NFL Hall of Fame there are players that did not go to the super bowl and still are present... Same thing for The Majors and the NBA...
[1:14:41] hahwinner: @zashezi LUL accurate
[1:14:43] kaptainhat: doubelift has been the best or one of the best adc for 12 years straight tho
[1:14:43] nizzy2k11: @cozycoffin_ then there are less than 100 eligible players.

[1:14:49] kaptainhat: from NA
[1:14:50] Babyd72: if them why not jensen
[1:14:59] cozycoffin_: come on fellas are we really going to put NA players above all the GOATS of LPL AND LCK LMAO
[1:14:59] AsheOfAx: how many times has UZI won LCS?
[1:15:00] zashezi: @hahwinner "you contract is up in one year...." *walks out*
[1:15:06] Schmutzfanger: Schmutzfanger subscribed with Prime. 
[1:15:09] magillagorilla4sale: Sneaky or Jensen deserves it more no?
[1:15:13] Todo88: Dan Marino never won a Super Bowl and he definitely belongs in the NFL Hall
[1:15:13] TheDixieCup: would be core of DL imo
[1:15:19] DonNardo: babe Ruth is in the baseball hall of fame and is probably nowhere near as good as the players today
[1:15:21] VerbalHorse: They should name all the adc's more deserving thsan DL and see how long the list it
[1:15:25] finalnintendokid: DL - 6 LCS championships
[1:15:25] nfcpm: have you seen non esports hall of fames? they have tons of people that you would question
[1:15:26] i_play_viktor: if DL gets in, there should be 50+ inducted
[1:15:28] zerovisible: diamonprox is like the same level as DL wat
[1:15:28] cozycoffin_: Core won worlds LOL
[1:15:35] j_tripper: when is beryl being inducted

[1:15:39] Deadpan: id put core in before DL
[1:15:41] VerbalHorse: Should be best like any Hall of Fame no?
[1:15:46] dv9r: the interesting question is should someone like... Evi or BRTT make HOF
[1:15:46] Grenadier08: I think Sneaky should be in
[1:15:48] nizzy2k11: HoL is a sham if dyrus doesn't get in.
[1:15:49] mithrilblue: many people in the HOF in MBL never won the world series or even a playoff series
[1:15:55] TheRealDivert: theres criteria that gets Reginald in ;D
[1:15:58] mithrilblue: MLB*
[1:15:59] PapaSmithy: brtt for sure, he's > dl @dv9r

[1:16:00] dropsofliquid: Best by region is going to be super different than best everywhere though
[1:16:05] zprotato: @Rectifier15 as he should, 11+ years longevity + worlds winner + msi finalist
[1:16:06] kud0slol: just make it relative their region uhhh doiiii
[1:16:08] yanya7701: @dv9r ah no
[1:16:10] pfwangers: not winning a championship isnt a big issue in mlb

[1:17:32] nfcpm: put Phreak in with Dash
[1:17:34] frozenturdx: letigress in the hall of fame?
[1:17:36] AsheOfAx: If we're putting Analysts into HoF Emily Rand should be first in line
[1:17:37] JChongg: but honestly, quickshot needs to get in
[1:17:37] DavidSzajnuk: never
[1:17:38] JP_029: DL and Bjerg for sure should be in the hall of fame
[1:17:41] j_tripper: also based

[1:17:47] yanya7701: so no Faker?
[1:17:50] cozycoffin_: L take
[1:17:52] nizzy2k11: @travisgafford dyrus was the most subbed streamer on twitch in the early days and played league almost exclusively. he did so much for the game in the beginning.
[1:17:54] ProteusWest: it's 5
[1:17:57] Rectifier15: its 5 not 10
[1:17:57] VerbalHorse: Most sports are also like 100 years old

[1:17:59] wiggles10: football is 5 years for HOF eligibility
[1:18:00] Todo88: Disagree, Faker is easily the goat and should be inducted first
[1:18:00] Punecake: xPeke has to be in the hall of fame still talked about to this day
[1:18:01] mithrilblue: thats why typically they have to wait
[1:18:02] the1andonlycorbin: I agree Cubby, wait till after they retire
[1:18:03] AsheOfAx: D: Boomer?
[1:18:04] boba_bunbun: theyre not gna sell skins like that
[1:18:04] KSnOwnage: Eastern players looked up to DL in the past. I compare it to traditional sports and old school players. Old school NBA players would not be great in today's NBA but they still made it to the HoF.
[1:18:05] cozycoffin_: L TAKE
[1:18:05] Azikielboi: Faker goes in now
[1:18:06] sirtakalot: 5 in MLB

[1:18:15] Ikancast: then why not wait to make this until he retires
[1:18:16] Esdara: add them after they retired
[1:18:17] Todo88: 100
[1:18:17] VerbalHorse: Who tf would go in before Faker?
[1:18:17] JampireM: Thats like if Kibler had to stop playing mtg to be in hall of fame @Cubbyxx
[1:18:19] Azikielboi: its gonna be so dumb to put anyone in that ISNT faker
[1:18:20] cozycoffin_: FAKER IS THE FIRST ONE

[1:18:20] MacDaAce: Phreak/ Dash/ Kobe/ Rivington should all be in caster hall of fame
[1:18:22] CRlCK3T: Should be regional specific
[1:18:23] Useless_BM: faker could have retired after s7 worlds and still be the goat

[1:18:27] imshades: Faker is league of legends
[1:18:29] zashezi: @hahwinner it's too cringey when people ask those questions. I thought Dak's response to McCarthy question was perfect
[1:18:29] rvollert: Idk why it matters that you have to be retired
[1:18:30] Game8910: Madlife
[1:18:30] Todo88: Hell yeah Mark
[1:18:30] Ian7j2: I'm with cubby on this
[1:18:32] d3xy_h: so they should have waited
[1:18:33] mithrilblue: it doesnt matter who the first person it
[1:18:33] DavidSzajnuk: Was Tom Brady the first?
[1:18:34] dropsofliquid: No other league even made people follow their current rules when they made the hall of fame
[1:18:34] TheRealDivert: lets penalize faker for still being the boat
[1:18:34] Azikielboi: imagine saying faker isnt the best player ever to exist in this game??
[1:18:34] VerbalHorse: Faker deserves to be first
[1:18:35] PapaSmithy: why can't it be the first star of league fo legends
[1:18:36] TheRealDivert: goat *
[1:18:36] gurg7: agree

[1:18:54] AznGamer007: idt LoL can afford to wait ~3yrs+ to induct players
[1:18:55] TheRealDivert: TBF, faker has enough skins
[1:18:55] ProteusWest: it's 5 pretty much everywhere, they did put Roberto Clemente in without 5 right after he died in a plane crash, I think Babe Ruth went in while he was still playing since he was in the first class, could be wrong
[1:18:56] yami545: it'd be such a joke to not have faker in the lol hall of fane
[1:18:57] a_large_farvaaaa: kkoma should be in
[1:19:02] Rectifier15: That Faker Ahri skin is gonna sell

[1:19:47] WrenWings: It's just really, really weird to have a player in the hall of fame still actively playing
[1:19:56] ProteusWest: Zeka in the Hall of Fame
[1:20:00] yami545: no one else is faker tho
[1:20:01] Fatescore: So...What version of Sneaky is going to get inducted?
[1:20:01] dropsofliquid: Faker is not that person that's a fake argument
[1:20:02] JChongg: does jackeylove deserve hof

[1:20:19] kud0slol: doublelift > faker
[1:20:20] rhythmkiller: Boooooooo 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅 fuck the commish
[1:20:21] yami545: if you win 4 times and get inducted that's fine
[1:20:22] cozycoffin_: THE GAPP IS HUGE
[1:20:25] Todo88: Faker has multiple HoF careers
[1:20:26] Tunatoogood: ? Why
[1:20:27] pokeypls: do we throw insec and madlife in because they influence the game
[1:20:31] AsheOfAx: Just call it the Hall of Faker and make it only one spot.
[1:20:31] yami545: has xhiaohu won world's 4 times?
[1:20:32] Mounizle: iono bout that cubby
[1:20:34] yami545: no
[1:20:35] dropsofliquid: W/e that's fine but Faker has to be first
[1:20:36] FreeleyDan: who can stand next to Gretzky?
[1:20:36] evict_timaze: The issue here is is that you don't do it the same year they win a worlds, the crown comparison doesn't make any sense
[1:20:38] yanya7701: longevity in NA means nothing, theres is a reason why this region is flooded with 30 yr old players lol
[1:20:39] ThexCatmanx: Insec has to be in there
[1:20:40] MacDaAce: give faker his own hallway and have him wait until the career is over
[1:20:40] skaels: Faker is an exception, hes the only one to get it early
[1:20:40] Tunatoogood: Faker not even close to 2nd
[1:20:41] juan_juario: How about they aren't allowed to be inducted until X years after they STARTED playing pro?
[1:20:42] Ristow: every Worlds win takes 1 year off of your "must be retired" eligibility
[1:20:46] yami545: spring lion != faker
[1:20:46] TheDixieCup: if its a legacy it should be after their legacy of playing is over imo
[1:20:46] mithrilblue: u do classes based on years retired
[1:20:53] dropsofliquid: @FreeleyDan Faker obvs. Gretzky has old man hands
[1:20:55] shinwinter: it ok i like xiaohu msi  thing
[1:20:56] AsheOfAx: The Queue with Dash?
[1:20:57] MacDaAce: MJ had to wait
[1:20:57] JP_029: They should do a class. The game isnt going to last long enough
[1:21:04] DuffAlex: sotlKobeyay sotlKobeyay sotlKobeyay sotlKobeyay
[1:21:04] WrenWings: @juan_juario I like this idea
[1:21:06] namefu1: iwd first ballot
[1:21:10] MagiMik_: Get Ambition in there
[1:21:14] PapaSmithy: when is keria eligible? 1 more worlds win? 5 years of active playing? some other arbitrary variable?
[1:21:14] MacDaAce: Larry Bird had to wait
[1:21:16] juan_juario: If you have a 10 year long Hall of Fame worthy career, you are allowed a few bad years lol
[1:21:18] pokeypls: get dardoch in there
[1:21:22] Game8910: So is Impact also elegible now?
[1:21:22] JeroamThePI3: Uzi Bengi Marin Wolf the first 4 inductees
[1:21:23] TheDixieCup: a hall of fame is a celebration of a career, even though the goat is still playing it should be after retire i think
[1:21:25] mithrilblue: if only there were other leagues who have great systems and standards set up for HoF…..
[1:21:26] a_large_farvaaaa: MIKE YEUNG FIRST OR BUST
[1:21:36] ProteusWest: there are arbitrary variables for HoF induction in every other sport
[1:21:39] WrenWings: Justice for Mike Yeung
[1:21:39] DonNardo: lol you walk in. it’s a peristalsis with a portrait of faker, and then the exit.
[1:21:42] JeroamThePI3: Bang Uzi Bengi MaRin Wolf top 5
[1:21:44] cozycoffin_: 1.Faker 2.Beryl 3. Uzi 4. Mata
[1:21:52] yanya7701: Keria is not a rookie
[1:21:52] dropsofliquid: They could just make different rules going forward
[1:21:59] meister107: if anyone gets to be in it first from the west, it has to be caps or jankos
[1:22:01] ProteusWest: it's 5
[1:22:05] DonNardo: I think Dardock deserves to be in
[1:22:06] dropsofliquid: Faker should get in though
[1:22:09] mithrilblue: thats why u wait till they retire
[1:22:09] Ikancast: this isnt the coolest thing
[1:22:11] Azikielboi: BASEG markz
[1:22:11] cozycoffin_: SO Many more players in the LCK that are miles above LCS players
[1:22:13] 1DeepBlue: the 5 year retirement is so we know they won't come back and change things
[1:22:13] MacDaAce: Would Danny make it? he was 100% best ADC in NA that year
[1:22:13] juan_juario: Exactly, we get to make the rules lol
[1:22:19] mithrilblue: bro Mark makes no sense

[1:22:24] shinwinter: BASED
[1:22:25] Freezman13: W
[1:22:25] magillagorilla4sale: @JeroamThePI3 Wolf over Xiaohu is crazy
[1:22:29] pinkmagetv: just add Insec, Capt Jack, and Mata along with Faker
[1:22:30] dropsofliquid: @MacDaAce Obviously one year isn't hall of fame worthy
[1:22:32] AsheOfAx: HALL OF FAKER
[1:22:33] Todo88: sure
[1:22:37] notevenstevenn: Nah hall of fame is only after retirment
[1:22:37] zashezi: we should move away from tsports talk - travis might fall asleep
[1:22:38] wiggles10: Bowlers can become PBA hall of famers while they are still bowling
[1:22:38] cozycoffin_: yes
[1:22:43] mithrilblue: ur contradicting the point
[1:22:47] FitzyFarseer: @Cubbyxx love your idea with faker
[1:22:50] Azikielboi: faker is responsible for at least 10% of riot revenue no cap
[1:23:02] AngelHorror: faker can stand alone without other people being held to an arbitrary two years
[1:23:04] Azikielboi: completely factually
[1:23:05] MacDaAce: @dropsofliquid I agree... but thats kinda what sucks, he could have been if his career went longer
[1:23:07] TheRoobToob: @zashezi a crisp magic the gathering pack will wake him up
[1:23:08] sirtakalot: first year... every region gets 1 player

[1:23:17] TheDixieCup: i think it should be mega exclusive imo, i think personally it should be like 3 players max per year
[1:23:19] notevenstevenn: It doenst matter if he is first or last. hes legacy speaks for itself. infact the longer it takes the better because it means hes been dominatiing for that much longer

[1:23:26] elemenokeeb: Why do we care about what traditional sports does
[1:23:28] ProteusWest: so inducting Faker in the first class has precedent
[1:23:29] VerbalHorse: That'd be pretty pog
[1:23:29] nfcpm: once you put Faker in, he'll never try again. Like qualifying for worlds during the spring split.
[1:23:31] MacDaAce: IM fakering RN
[1:23:33] skaels: YES
[1:23:34] Todo88: yeah that'd be sick as hell

[1:23:58] DonNardo: the Faker client
[1:24:00] bii_bella: LOL
[1:24:02] TheDixieCup: it means more if we keep it so exclusive 3 players a year to keep it actually meaningful, dont make it so many players it means nothing
[1:24:02] mithrilblue: why does Faker need to be the first to be inducted??
[1:24:04] sirtakalot: skins already enough to commemorate someone

[1:44:16] Useless_BM: yo rep 616
[1:44:30] numiiigoesrawrz: take: for mark, how has his role as caster/host helped with the transition being a LCS commissioner?
[1:45:19] paarthos: loved the LCS X account frequent updates.
[1:45:50] DonNardo: I have a question for mark: how dare you?
[1:46:31] Todo88: LUL

[1:50:38] bussy_bopper: :( this is the last hotline league appearance of marquis zimmerman
[1:50:42] saint734: @PapaSmithy unrelated but what would you prefer like how strict the lolesports hall of fame entry is; like who's the best player to not get in
[1:50:44] scaf6: like?
[1:50:53] punisheddegen: if the lcs is so big why wont it fight me
[1:50:53] Useless_BM: did u call for these things
[1:51:16] frozenturdx: @Mark how are you going to help NA win worlds?
[1:51:23] nfcpm: plus he has only been there 4 weeks
[1:51:25] ezio___________: hopefully wrote a good script
[1:51:44] Useless_BM: how good is the spring split script
[1:51:50] Bobacola: I'm having a hard time adjusting to Mark's serious interview now. I'm use to him trolling, dunking on Travis, dunking on callers, and where is the cat?
[1:52:18] Relise_lol: good
[1:52:24] coin1: Clap
[1:52:35] gurg7: mark goat
[1:52:38] PapaSmithy: now I know what I can specifically blame Mark Zimmerman for Pog
[1:52:38] AsheOfAx: Travis making the guest uncomfortable, what else is new
[1:52:40] Jon_Oki: sorry
[1:52:41] punisheddegen: my goat too humble
[1:52:46] HippoSquirrel: Wow, Mark hogging the spotlight over here, taking all the credit for everyone's hard work
[1:52:56] hahwinner: Mark is making a bid to get a POG
[1:52:59] karonmoser: Tolstoy hated accounts of history that single out a single person because he always believed that major events were an accumulation of many people + randomness
[1:53:01] scaf6: We want to see your influence and how much you can change
[1:53:09] razlol: 26 raiders from razlol have joined!

[1:53:28] TheDixieCup: just put @razlol shirtless on cam and viewership will skyrocket
[1:53:31] colesworthy: the litmus test here for mark should be: would this have happened with a different commissioner? if it’s not a definite resounding yes the you deserve some credit
[1:53:36] nfcpm: Markz can fire them all so they fear him
[1:53:37] TheHaarpist: @TheDixieCup So true
[1:53:38] JChongg: @WopaPlays 1 hour of silver scrapes - Mark Zimmerman
[1:53:39] leagueofemily: @karonmoser Tolstoy was right (also as a random related aside, in media we often make teams of people into one character of a movie/TV show/book/etc.)
[1:53:41] numiiigoesrawrz: thanks raz for the raid
[1:53:51] Todo88: GIGACHAD just watch

[1:54:21] Useless_BM: cant wait for flowers to read the zoe copy pasta on stream
[1:54:24] xxSirlancealotx: Mark how close are we to getting the captianflowers last place vs next to last place drunk casting matches? LUL
[1:54:25] TheRealDivert: Mark is a leader now, he gives credit for successes and takes blame for failures.
[1:54:33] Game8910: Markz already cooking the next controversy
[1:54:34] shinwinter: yeah like bo3 right ? aware
[1:54:35] TheDixieCup: id rather you as commish set up our players and teams for international competition than fan service
[1:54:43] nfcpm: and full healthcare
[1:54:44] Todo88: xdd
[1:54:45] TheDixieCup: but i could be alone in that
[1:54:48] chuimyko: i am personally offended the mark did not take my personal schedule into account when choosing times for lcs
[1:55:04] karlheinzstockfootage: wayching lec for the weekend, markz has already made a better watching experience
[1:55:23] Vecuu: bee woo woooo
[1:55:28] Freezman13: KDA
[1:55:39] Game8910: Markz piercing light when

[1:55:44] dropsofliquid: Hellll yes
[1:55:48] ant_eyes: HE SAID WHEN NOT IF
[1:55:48] DonNardo: what’s the new parking spot like mark?
[1:55:53] Azikielboi: that makes it better
[1:55:57] razlol: the worst thing about this change is that I cant fuck with Mark on the desk every day
[1:55:58] Azikielboi: that makes it even more funny
[1:56:08] LazyThunderlane: $teve
[1:56:08] baka_player: LUL
[1:56:10] game2getherstay2gether: You should pull the girl from NAMEN to ask questions with Mark Z
[1:56:11] Cubbyxx: @razlol Don't let your dreams be memes you still can
[1:56:12] dropsofliquid: wow no faith at all
[1:56:17] DonNardo: you could say semis and still have the same outcome
[1:56:19] ofay07: Still crazy how Mark was essentially clawing on for his casting and analyzing position now he's commissioner. Wild. Perseverance paid off
[1:56:20] Azikielboi: really badly sing our anthem without any US players on the world finals NA team
[1:56:27] Azikielboi: that sound perfect
[1:56:27] saint734: Mark not allowed to comment cuz Steve will be sending emails in the morning
[1:56:36] TheDixieCup: cubby love
[1:56:39] karlheinzstockfootage: 60% canadians.  10% americans, 3% imports.
[1:56:50] karlheinzstockfootage: *30%
[1:57:04] theemarkz: @razlol its the main reason I changed jobs
[1:57:08] punisheddegen: how will mark becoming commissioner affect lebron's legacy?
[1:57:12] theemarkz: to run from you
[1:57:16] TheDixieCup: 'BACK IN THE DAY" this guy
[1:57:20] notevenstevenn: Thats me !
[1:57:29] razlol: @theemarkz I will replace you with a mark dummy instead
[1:57:48] theemarkz: Find that weird mannequin we made for the doublielift episode with your face on it
[1:57:52] nfcpm: lol
[1:57:59] xxSirlancealotx: magical fruit take
[1:58:01] Azikielboi: monkaS
[1:58:03] karlheinzstockfootage: does riot give canadian or american green cards for long time players?
[1:58:07] lol_Lunari: monkaS
[1:58:07] littleindianman12: good take
[1:58:08] Azikielboi: disrespectful monkaS
[1:58:10] razlol: @theemarkz my first mission
[1:58:12] Jon_Oki: get raz on LUL
[1:58:12] nfcpm: i think not banning would be a travesty
[1:58:16] imainleesin: rip
[1:58:20] numiiigoesrawrz: take: Riot banning live coverage of NACL open qualifiers / tier 3 is disrespectful to all parties involved (production, casters, players, etc)
[1:58:20] Relise_lol: beenes the goat
[1:58:33] 2Realistic: Beans is a crazy name LUL
[1:58:41] nfcpm: it overlaps pro LOL games
[1:58:41] littleindianman12: really happy that you guys pulled someone who talked about this
[1:58:42] Todo88: 0 minutes without LCS Commissioner controversy Aware
[1:58:42] numiiigoesrawrz: maryville and LiT esports has promoted into NACL because of this system
[1:58:47] saint734: Cubby about to go crazy
[1:58:48] eliaswrites: Beans is a name I had to cut from Players
[1:58:58] eliaswrites: because it was "too distracting"
[1:58:58] frozenturdx: Raz go and ask your new boss  a question 🤣
[1:59:10] JChongg: nacl oq and promos are some of the most fun ive had watching league
[1:59:14] nfcpm: just move the qualifier to weekdays
[1:59:19] numiiigoesrawrz: OQ = open qualifiers

[1:59:28] numiiigoesrawrz: open qualifiers is considered "tier 3" in a way
[1:59:31] JChongg: @nfcpm most players have school/jobs/ etc.
[1:59:41] razlol: @frozenturdx he would hate his life I would just ask if he's a thigh guy
[1:59:53] itsRoulette: BOOOOOO
[2:00:05] Azikielboi: TRUEEE
[2:00:09] Azikielboi: BASED TRAVIS
[2:00:12] imshades: L MarkZ L
[2:00:19] Przemysl15: this take was the most reacted in discord by far
[2:00:20] itsRoulette: L Markz
[2:00:26] maverin116: lots of emotes means the hot takes whether we like or hate it
[2:00:26] JChongg: so its very hard to have them play during the week, for most this is just them pursuing their dreams, not out of the money they make (if at all)
[2:00:29] lady_empire: if we are losing mark, can we keep the cat?
[2:00:34] nfcpm: it woudln't make sense for riot to allow it to overlap
[2:00:46] bizdgil: kekw
[2:00:50] Cubbyxx: https://twitter.com/smrtalia/status/1747020655743078598
[2:00:54] Cubbyxx: ^announcement of this
[2:00:56] numiiigoesrawrz: good tweet ^^
[2:01:20] 2Realistic: MarkZ's first L Sadge
[2:01:26] firadin0011: but what's the cost to let it stream?? like who's going to watch it you're going to pull 10s of viewers from LCS
[2:02:04] karonmoser: Private streams don't really solve the ecosystem issue
[2:02:05] 2Realistic: Oh no dont steal little John and Timmy from the LCS' main stream. Dont want to lose those 2 viewers
[2:02:37] kerokerogrips: MarkZ first L , smh
[2:02:45] HippoSquirrel: @firadin0011 Listen, LCS doesn't have a lot of viewers. Losing 10 viewers is like 15% of the LCS audience.
[2:02:53] TheDixieCup: its not so much as steal from LCS as much as NACL not getting the spotlight right?
[2:02:54] karonmoser: I think the caller would agree with this comment
[2:03:00] Jon_Oki: YES
[2:03:01] Azikielboi: KEKW
[2:03:04] Todo88: LULW
[2:03:07] Azikielboi: HE IS A PROFESSIONAL ICANT
[2:03:12] Azikielboi: AND HE IS LOSING TO A BLANKET
[2:03:12] xmiliana: riot discovers that viewers can have 2 tabs open at once
[2:03:13] Azikielboi: AND A CHAIR
[2:03:14] karonmoser: @TheDixieCup OQ and NACL overlapped last year, didn't matter
[2:03:16] shroomfive: LUL
[2:03:17] Game8910: Commissioner does not care CONFIRMED
[2:03:21] dropsofliquid: His fleece heart blanked inted him

[2:03:26] punisheddegen: lost to a chair kek
[2:03:28] leagueofemily: @karonmoser ^^^^^^^^^
[2:03:29] ThexCatmanx: Keepo

[2:03:43] numiiigoesrawrz: tweet cubby is talking about
[2:03:49] firadin0011: certainly a non-live VOD is going to *hurt* coverage, not help it
[2:03:57] karlheinzstockfootage: i was shocked seeing that heretix was g2 today, also g2 too.
[2:04:28] kerokerogrips: is the unofficial stream a rights thing ?
[2:05:03] karlheinzstockfootage: der komissar wearing heart blanket cape <3
[2:05:22] xmiliana: theres hope?!?!
[2:05:48] lol_g0rdo: Js Whoopley has been referencing "prioritization of LCS" in most of his messaging regarding this, so a little frustrating to hear Mark say that "it's Whoopley's area". Obviously want to give a chance for Mark to look into it like he said
[2:05:59] Todo88: Beans bringin receipts
[2:06:10] 2Realistic: Dont fw Beans, hes standing on business
[2:06:12] lolmihir: hello T Gaff
[2:06:12] JChongg: throps fricking out
[2:06:13] xmiliana: @lol_g0rdo so real man
[2:06:24] xmiliana: @JChongg no 1 can watch throps gg
[2:06:38] firadin0011: lmao mark is now backing up to "yeah actually the 10s of viewers would be a problem"
[2:06:44] itsRoulette: as a NA native that has given up on NA, I'd rather watch OQs over LCS anyday
[2:06:44] karlheinzstockfootage: lec had -40% viewership this wekend
[2:06:49] xmiliana: pov streams r not allowed either
[2:06:53] JChongg: @xmiliana actually sad
[2:07:08] TheRealDivert: Are you saying a 20 viewer stream isnt legitimate?
[2:07:12] zjenkens: Maybe its more of a resources thing?
[2:07:26] nfcpm: yeah 20 viewers is a meme
[2:07:28] theemarkz: no im saying 20 isnt a concern for the lcs
[2:07:31] numiiigoesrawrz: TEAM FISH TACO
[2:07:36] Noreason_4: TFT BABY
[2:07:36] JChongg: TFT BABY VAMOS
[2:07:38] numiiigoesrawrz: GOOD LUCK BEENS
[2:07:42] BigSherv: TFT
[2:07:42] theemarkz: but if we you have ultiple 500-1000 viewer streams on, maybe it is
[2:07:45] TheRealDivert: I was just trying to get travis clickbait title
[2:07:45] BigSherv: GANG GANG
[2:07:47] itsRoulette: TFT!!! LETS GO BOYS
[2:07:51] theemarkz: not that 20 viewers is a meme
[2:07:51] karlheinzstockfootage: rubio's
[2:07:53] 2Realistic: No shot, the name Beans is on a team called Fish Taco LUL
[2:07:54] numiiigoesrawrz: good luck TFT i miss u in NACL
[2:07:58] numiiigoesrawrz: i still have ur pin

[2:08:15] Fudgenator: love team fish taco
[2:08:17] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:08:20] BigSherv: Mark just casually memeing OQ numbers, which are low. But for some of these players it's the most amount of exposure they'll ever get
[2:08:23] itsRoulette: I'll become a member travis when my good takes actually get picked up :P
[2:08:24] Bobacola: 76 month sub
[2:08:25] JChongg: shouldve been them instead of {redacted}
[2:08:34] LateNiteArc: @theemarkz can you leak the script to us?
[2:08:36] Bobacola: i missed the 69 month sub
[2:08:36] Noreason_4: @theemarkz do you think NACL after LCS will put more eyes onto NACL
[2:08:37] BigSherv: so at least having SOMETHING that's live that they can share with their circles is huge
[2:08:38] TheDixieCup: @travisgafford is it more beneficial for you to sub on YT or twitch?
[2:08:41] numiiigoesrawrz: @JChongg 🤐
[2:08:42] Game8910: do we get the uncut version of the bed shot from the video?
[2:08:46] theemarkz: Well the matches are being recorded and broadcasted for those viewers later was probably the reasoning
[2:08:46] DonNardo: @travisgafford is there a way I can check on twitch if I have a prime to give?
[2:08:49] theemarkz: but like I said
[2:08:52] Cubbyxx: @BigSherv He gave credit to some of the bigger creators
[2:08:58] theemarkz: idk all the info around this so I dont wanna speculate too much
[2:08:59] woopsiedaisies: woopsiedaisies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:09:01] Cubbyxx: And OQ numbers are low, doesn't mean they don't matter
[2:09:08] Cubbyxx: I mean I was joking about it too
[2:09:10] razlol: A NINJA TURTLE
[2:09:11] karlheinzstockfootage: i like markz valentines cape
[2:09:12] BigSherv: @Cubbyxx I agree with this
[2:09:23] theemarkz: and I wasnt the one meming the 20, I said they were meming
[2:09:25] BigSherv: which is why the community streams should be allowed to exist
[2:09:25] leagueofemily: what are the sewers of MN?
[2:09:28] dropsofliquid: Wait the sewers or le sueur
[2:09:35] FullOfTryxz: Damn I wonder where the sewers are as a fellow minnesotan
[2:09:37] numiiigoesrawrz: take: mark wanted more EU > NA games throughout the year, is this a possibility and is there something vs South America in the future?
[2:09:40] BigSherv: hasn't been an issue before, surprised it is now
[2:09:44] rhoai: na > eu
[2:09:47] 2Realistic: MarkZ is standing on business rn
[2:09:51] Snitzel13: and south america
[2:09:52] XanderGauge77: gotta be minneapolis.
[2:09:53] nfcpm: didnt they announce a south america competition
[2:09:54] Sa1tonn: OCE > NA
[2:09:55] Todo88: ImTyping Clap
[2:10:00] Tameablebread93: imo Riot should outsource meta league related videos to noted multimedia firm Travis Gafford Industries
[2:10:01] XanderGauge77: probs north minneapolis
[2:10:01] imhei: dude crawled right out of the sewer for this take
