[1:13:32] vrgambit: They should be more afraid of his teemo, 100% winrate
[1:13:38] DaDaggerFace: it was kinda hard for them to balance items when supports couldnt afford items. and if they made items cheaper then everyone else built them
[1:13:56] kebimbimbab: streamer luck
[1:13:58] DudeBroMaximus: he will kick your ass with any supp but he will legit make you uninstall with Senna

[5:05:52] jannablowsu: guys either lying about being a smurf and lost a game bc of his attitude or he is actually a d1 smurf and it hopefully contributes to his tilt i assume hes playing in my elo bc hes hardstuck and hit a wall so losing in plat has to tilt him right

[8:04:43] fokinha92: It is very short but explains to some detail the advantages of having two support items
[8:05:01] ThomasTheTwink: double support item is just infinite money hack

[8:16:20] bluegazer1: trade secret
