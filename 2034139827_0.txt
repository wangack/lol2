[0:00:35] tobyteemo: wassup
[0:02:05] LeeFTW: Hiii
[0:02:30] tobyteemo: ad onhit ipavChad
[0:03:19] tobyteemo: u know how u say solo queue is all about full dmg? just go full ad onhit dmg no defensive ipavChad
[0:03:23] tobyteemo: full murder hamster
[0:04:14] tobyteemo: on ad onhit u can go hourglass and banshee too since kraken is scale off of ap
[0:04:23] tobyteemo: and e onhit gives lifesteal even on ap
[0:04:31] tobyteemo: so it helps u heal more from bork
[0:04:36] tobyteemo: i wanna try it on game soon
[0:06:01] tobyteemo: lifesteal super important and trap just get sweeper from enemy anyway
[0:06:03] LtChezo: hexplate would be too annoying, youd constantly have to watch your item timer if you want to take advantage of its second passive
[0:07:26] LtChezo: but you cant place for vision or to counter gank if you think you might want to fight
[0:08:52] theshadowninja89: Can pink ward detect you while invisible on passive?
[0:09:02] theshadowninja89: Is any way to detect?
[0:09:06] LtChezo: @theshadowninja89 no
[0:09:18] LtChezo: true
[0:09:31] theshadowninja89: Ok sometimes I feel like they know where I am even when I am hidden
[0:09:36] tobyteemo: new taimo ultimate pog
[0:09:43] theshadowninja89: They are going directly to that bush
[0:10:31] tobyteemo: i feel defense is lacky for all teemo
[0:10:35] LtChezo: true i guess it better most items for ad teemo
[0:10:48] tobyteemo: just get popped
[0:10:51] theshadowninja89: On AD u have that lifesteal from botrk
[0:11:16] tobyteemo: bring back hurricane bloodthirster chinese taimo?
[0:11:49] tobyteemo: replace shield with bloodline
[0:12:02] theshadowninja89: I feel like there's nothing u can do this champion is projected to be squishy
[0:12:21] tobyteemo: or not bloodline but that shield thing on triumph presence of mind tier
[0:12:23] theshadowninja89: Because if he will get too much sustain and dmg will be broken
[0:12:30] AYAYA_JAM: wits end instead of scimitar?
[0:12:36] tobyteemo: the overhearl
[0:12:57] tobyteemo: @theshadowninja89 idk teemo had good sustain last season and wasn't broken

[1:49:41] Pohjolanmies777: does this ever end ?
[1:49:45] Pohjolanmies777: does he conclude a build ?
[1:50:12] Pohjolanmies777: Do you atleast have like top 3 builds ?
[1:50:45] SpringSong: he dont wana be useless with that builds
[1:52:33] SpringSong: yea rumble passive is too strong and his ult kinda broken
[1:53:28] SpringSong: kennen is good for always cuz aeo stun
[1:54:00] VoodooChild420: good at bonking
[1:56:54] LeRoiVert: @ipav999 target range is 1700
[1:57:01] LeRoiVert: range is its length

[1:58:00] VoodooChild420: short story
[1:58:20] bomzzwtf: so like every champ Kappa
[1:58:53] LeRoiVert: i see no snake in that list
[1:58:59] LeRoiVert: cass weak vs teemo now?
[1:59:39] VoodooChild420: also crazy AOE
[2:00:54] VoodooChild420: not much mobility
[2:01:46] Bluichu: what do you think about the lvl 2 e, q max some teemo mains are doing?
[2:02:46] skreppatada: gamergirlWave im confused at when to use grasp? is it for when im building tank? NOTED
[2:02:48] Bluichu: RaccAttack
[2:03:16] Bluichu: AYAYA
[2:06:52] iohah: Prayge soon
[2:07:28] HOPE_Ismail_Abi: MYAAA
[2:07:44] SpringSong: low tier mostly ''this champ fun so lets play'' mentallity
[2:08:37] iohah: I play low tier when I'm autofil - just don't feed strat
[2:08:38] HOPE_Ismail_Abi: if a champ skin worthy riot keeps them in meta
[2:09:42] SpringSong: im low tier player and im playing teemo cuz it fun to see someone get die to shroom and curse at teemo
[2:09:42] iohah: NODDERS syndra also ez and broken
[2:13:14] iohah: 200years is so low in high elo? 🤔
[2:16:12] JayeLau: beefed up riven
[2:16:21] iohah: aatrox early levels he does not have much kill pressure (compared to other)
[2:17:08] SpringSong: well thats not a weakness
[2:17:16] Azure_Grace99: he dies really easy to garen/urgot/etc if he e to them tho
[2:18:44] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[2:19:39] Azure_Grace99: udyr doesn’t really die in lane if he plays somewhat well tho, and can sustain heavier poke than aatrox for example @ipav999
[2:19:49] Azure_Grace99: really good gank setup too
[2:20:18] serrolo: there is no shaco top??
[2:21:03] iohah: I haven't played or saw iPav play vs udyr top much, so i got nothing to say about him KEKW
[2:21:13] Azure_Grace99: I played a lot of Camille into jayce and that champ does some really high dmg even if really behind in lane
[2:21:24] Azure_Grace99: you have to play to get jng help every game
[2:22:55] Azure_Grace99: ap teemo dies quite easily tho
[2:23:19] SpringSong: but it is easy to get rid of with control ward+radar thingy
[2:23:25] 提哞在身邊: aakk3004
[2:25:00] Azure_Grace99: teemo is good if he can prep for obj I guess @ipav999
[2:27:27] kammazu12: Hi ipav! Will you play today?
[2:27:28] Azure_Grace99: I hang out on my alt in emerald a lot with friends and the enemy team already knows how to not to suffer to teemo traps usually
[2:28:45] Azure_Grace99: yeah that’s the thing, you have to have prio too
[2:30:53] Azure_Grace99: @ipav999 I hate rumble, call me a noob but I think he needs a nerf asap. too much shield and dps and burst, everything. strong in lane, strong out of lane, too mich
[2:30:57] serrolo: hide behind a tank
[2:31:49] SpringSong: riot should change that stupid radar thing
[2:32:50] Azure_Grace99: i haven’t tried yet to prioritize split with teemo with season, like with hurricane, but from your talk I get it doesn’t really work well
[2:32:53] SpringSong: like kha just jump and Q teemo to death
[2:34:04] baylife30: its always been like this with teemo, its why pros dont play him, hes shitty and unreliable.  One of my favorites
[2:34:22] DeadlyBoy1234: similar issues with other mages?
[2:35:50] SpringSong: mages can carry team with cc or they can manage to fight with their control aoe unlike teemo cant do anyof those also mages can one shot squishy from far distance @DeadlyBoy1234
[2:36:37] Azure_Grace99: @ipav999 that’s what I was saying, but this season how is splitting teemo?
[2:36:45] JayeLau: hull breaker teemo Kekw
[2:36:51] VoodooChild420: true
[2:36:59] VoodooChild420: teemo no burst
[2:37:43] SgpFubar: How is he so bad with such a high winrate? Inflaction from early season?
[2:38:02] DeadlyBoy1234: isnt teemo like a mage adc , u get auto and shroom control.
[2:38:23] SpringSong: @SgpFubar that winrate come from low elo which is no one get red radar and control ward to clear shrooms
[2:38:30] Tiberth: vision is important, i think teemo provides good utility with vision
[2:39:23] xPoseidon: Yeah ive never seen Teemo as a hard carry.
[2:39:28] SgpFubar: @SpringSong Nah, plat+ 52.69%, emerald+ 52.56% Dia+ 51.78% and masters+ 51.64%
[2:39:45] matiko280: can teemo abuse overpowered item or rune
[2:40:11] DeadlyBoy1234: @SgpFubar looks like a yi pattern
[2:40:39] xPoseidon: I think Teemo just make very hard pressure on the map for your team.
[2:40:49] xPoseidon: And with shrooms it makes people hard to come gank you
[2:40:59] xPoseidon: Well not "hard" but annoying
[2:41:08] iohah: pretty similar to trundle
[2:41:16] matiko280: 1v9 - win EZ
[2:42:10] SpringSong: @SgpFubar emerald is low tier dia lower high elo so if you talk about high elo its master+ and you cant any teemo unless if there is otp in master+
[2:42:12] DeadlyBoy1234: split push in a nutshell
[2:42:51] SpringSong: you cant see any teemo*
[2:43:14] SgpFubar: @SpringSong Yet your argument was wr comes from low elo, which is statistically nto trute xd
[2:43:31] SpringSong: it come from low elo
[2:43:52] SpringSong: if winrate that good why there is not alot of high elo player plays teemo?
[2:44:32] SpringSong: that makes ur argument to wrong  if there is a champ good enough to get high winrate high elo players gona abuse it forsure
[2:44:36] SgpFubar: There are not? Clearly you not tracking the graphs on lolalitics DX
[2:45:42] SpringSong: check the master+ champ list so you can see which champs is mostly played at top lane
[2:47:13] SgpFubar: Well statitcs dont lie, if you think teemo is weak you have the right to your opinion
[2:47:29] SgpFubar: Yet he has a better winrate now that previous patch
[2:47:38] SgpFubar: You are reduced to one build vs multiple
[2:47:42] SgpFubar: yet his winrate increased
[2:47:55] SgpFubar: Lets see further down the season after the stats inflation is goner
[2:48:45] SpringSong: @SgpFubar I already said to istatistic high elo players dont play teemo you can see it from ur lolililitic whatever is that site is there is for sure champ list for every lane you can see which champs mostly pick
[2:51:01] iohah: while split, you can counter assasin by running away faster KEKW rip galeforce
[2:51:27] SgpFubar: @SpringSong So teemo is placed 25th in pick rate list, so all the champs beneth him are weak since master+ dont pick him?
[2:51:55] SpringSong: there is a reason they dont pick that champs
[2:52:05] tootetsu: they do all that + nerf him to show dominance
[2:52:40] iohah: ah ye kayn mechanics... good point NOTED
[2:53:05] SgpFubar: @SpringSong So rengar master+ has a 1.22% pick rate vs teemo 2.1% but has a 53.12% wr is rengar top weak? should he be buffed? LUL
[2:54:11] SgpFubar: And vayne has 1.6% but S tier with 53% wr, is he weak top? should she get nerfed? @SpringSong
[2:55:13] VoodooChild420: tfblade used to play camille alot
[2:55:15] VoodooChild420: not anymore
[2:55:52] SpringSong: SgpFubar lol what a weird and stubborn guy are you go and play teemo my guy it doesnt change teemo is weak
[2:56:09] SgpFubar: @SpringSong Are those champs weak then? by ur logic they are XD
[2:56:51] VoodooChild420: surprised that tryndamer and sion so low they good split pushers
[2:57:48] SgpFubar: The thing is how can teemo feel weak and have such a good winrate early on? Stats inflation?
[2:57:51] SgpFubar: Winrate*
[2:58:16] SpringSong: this guy thinks teemo strong cuz winrate %52 kekw
[2:59:06] SgpFubar: @SpringSong Did I say that? LUL I said how is he weaker than previous season while doing better?
[3:00:12] SpringSong: @SgpFubar basically same think if he isnt weaker that mean he is stronger than earlier season
[3:00:40] SpringSong: same thing*
[3:00:57] SgpFubar: Can't it be equal with a different play style? :O
[3:01:24] SgpFubar: And that the playstyle is strong rn due to items?
[3:01:25] SgpFubar: :O
[3:01:38] VoodooChild420: snowball taimo
[3:04:37] VoodooChild420: 27
[3:04:41] SpringSong: 24
[3:04:59] VoodooChild420: i wonder what pathing this guy does
[3:05:09] Edugator1: give the link in the chat
[3:05:09] xxpops: Have you tried gunblade?
[3:06:38] VoodooChild420: mr ipav what items would that be for you
[3:07:27] serrolo: its 25-30 mins
[3:07:28] Edugator1: @ipav999 can u give a link in the chat
[3:07:50] Edugator1: this
[3:07:54] ipav999: https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/Cupic%20Vtuber-Cupic
[3:08:02] Edugator1: yes
[3:08:03] SpringSong: this guy play as a botlane not support actually :D
[3:08:44] SpringSong: they go 2 enchanter mostly like sera sona or sona lux or sera lux
[3:09:23] matiko280: could be like dota with 60+ mins
[3:14:41] Edugator1: @ipav999 Now, there are  43 43 numbers in the list.  Average = 1082 43 Average=  43 1082 Calculating this, the average is approximately  25.163
[3:15:44] Edugator1: average game time 25 minutes

[3:18:57] Kuro_Hawk: you are good player. just need to be confident
[3:19:00] Alex_Erhart: I believe in you :)
[3:19:07] Tiberth: you are in master right, so obviously you are right
[3:19:54] OiTom: why are there 6 slot for items if the game is designed to end with 3
[3:20:12] xPoseidon: I mean doesnt that just mean low elo players dont know how to end games
[3:20:43] OiTom: that's true, I'm silver now and after 20min they just roam like flies
[3:20:44] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: i always report everyone peepoShrug

[3:21:59] SarahJaneLi: PokPikachu
[3:22:14] SpringSong: yozuXD
[3:26:26] serrolo: maybe if they change adaptative force in teemo to AP in next patch, it can push faster the line
[3:30:03] Lensendlot: is there a good build path cheat sheet for the current best items?
[3:30:45] chun1288: I love ap teemo man
[3:30:48] serrolo: seems that they are introducing it on teemo in 14.2
[3:33:30] razer_mon: MONKAAS
[3:33:44] Jotyma: Yo chat is riftmaker good on any Teemo builds?
[3:34:06] serrolo: you are not going to buy all of those in 25 minutes
[3:34:08] serrolo: xD
[3:35:11] SpringSong: are we sure that is good build cuz terminus kinda need 10 aa to proc
[3:36:46] SpringSong: yozuNoted
[3:37:01] serrolo: i miss Hextech Gunblade hope it returns someday
[3:37:24] Pitju99: jaksho best standalone tankiness, should be 4th imo
[3:38:06] SpringSong: and we need to focus on 2 item powerspike cuz game kinda end around 2-3 item
[3:42:12] Pitju99: it's never gonna be 3.5k without 4 dmg items
[3:43:23] Pitju99: wits end instead of qss could deal that amount
[3:43:50] xkayden0: either potion or 4th dmg item
[3:46:08] brscuti: does shadowflame crits on-hit damage?
[3:47:17] Pitju99: liandry
[3:47:30] SpringSong: @brscuti probably yes but İ didnt teyed it
[3:47:35] SpringSong: @SpringSong tried*
[3:47:43] Pitju99: heartsteel sucks rn
[3:48:34] SpringSong: what if we go green rune ?
[3:48:54] Pitju99: I thought that was given
[3:49:32] ddarknew: I'm pretty new to the channel, is there anywhere one can find the result of these calculations after the stream?
[3:49:43] Pitju99: not happening
[3:49:47] ddarknew: Somewhere where the recommanded builds are written?
[3:50:08] SpringSong: its not happen
[3:50:12] SpringSong: too much
[3:50:14] 514484: PavStrim FeelsGoodMan
[3:50:49] Pitju99: a lot
[3:51:02] Pitju99: it's because or the kraken
[3:51:06] SpringSong: 120 ap isnt low you know :d
[3:52:32] Pitju99: but then again when are you building the item
[3:53:14] Pitju99: yeah thats not bad
[3:53:38] Pitju99: but it's not like you wanna waste hourglass like that
[3:54:24] ddarknew: but if you can easily survive the 5 first seconds you won't hourglass, and you only use hourglass if it is needed to activate jaksho without taking too much damages
[3:54:33] ddarknew: I guess
[3:54:53] Pitju99: I think heartsteel just needs more buffs for this to be realistic
[3:55:53] 514484: teehee, he lost 1v0 PepeLaugh
[3:56:34] laith0002: what about new items?
[3:56:36] jeromefrance: @Pitju99 yes, i think he need a change too. i would like it to have a half item good to build it, like there is on other stuff
[3:56:49] laith0002: the new items*
[3:57:05] ParkingSeal: #FullAPey 🦍
[3:57:19] Pitju99: @jeromefrance yeah you're right, the buildpath is the worst thing ever it makes you lose lane half the time
[3:57:53] laith0002: guys any one feel that the game became strange?
[3:58:00] jeromefrance: @Plike hp stach up to 150 with time. but i guess it can be abuse by any champ after
[3:58:01] laith0002: i love the old one
[3:59:11] laith0002: i talk about the update
[3:59:34] Pitju99: is it because voidgrubs dont do as much as first herald?
[4:00:55] Pitju99: also the lanes are harder to gank
[4:00:59] Pitju99: so less kills i feel
[4:01:00] jeromefrance: @Pitju99 they said, changeged herald so it's not jus one shot gold, twisting too much the laming phase. they aim to spread gold on team, and spread dmg over time too
[4:02:04] Pitju99: I like it too cause dropping herald on someones lane basically sets them a kill behind
[4:02:17] jeromefrance: exactly
[4:02:37] 514484: and they added dedicated ultAH items for Teemo, they actually love Teemo PogBones Kappa
[4:02:42] SpringSong: but that stupid asasin item still gives too much haste
[4:04:11] SpringSong: ad that new sundering item is so stupid even champs like aat riv lee already strong af they been godly for 1v1 now
[4:04:23] mvious000: hey @ipav999, just joined the stream, could you briefly summarize the builds you made?
[4:04:26] Pitju99: so thats why teemo is good now he doesn't have a skillshot Kappa
[4:05:52] Pitju99: cait has self peel and Jinx has infinite movementspeed
[4:06:03] Pitju99: kogmaw has nothing just dmg
[4:06:44] mvious000: @ipav999 and how come you're not using malignance? Thoughts?
[4:06:52] jeromefrance: As mythic bonus is out, now i build those every game first. when full slot i up them.i try recurve box; hextech alternator, boots2lost chapter, oblivion orb.
[4:07:40] SpringSong: kiting hard and everychamp gona 1 shot you mid lane mages asasins even top lane full arm mr hp item champs
[4:08:03] SpringSong: so bein adc isnt fun
[4:08:32] Pitju99: is it because you dislike to play that way?
[4:08:44] jeromefrance: i'am sure ipav is not on mushroom focus style, i bet he wanna trow in some AA enhanced stuff and bruiser suit!
[4:10:15] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: unending despair tankmo ApuApustaja
[4:10:37] mvious000: @ipav999 opinions terminus?
[4:11:41] Pitju99: not a teemo item
[4:11:51] jeromefrance: do you add wit's end for some situational matchup? like vs magic top and cc like mordekeiser
[4:12:06] SpringSong: yea it mostly 170-200 heal
[4:12:24] SpringSong: for per champ I guess
[4:12:37] jeromefrance: what is the range of unending despair compared to teemo AA range?
[4:12:55] teemo_baby: teemo_baby subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 19 month streak! 2years thanks taimo sensei
[4:13:04] ddarknew: @jeromefrance It's quite lower I think
[4:13:38] jeromefrance: @ddarknew so we cannot cont on the dmg that much
[4:14:09] Pitju99: slowmo
[4:14:09] jeromefrance: Ipav, grab the 5% MS on half item and stay on it ^^
[4:14:17] JayeLau: ppl cant hit skillshots
[4:14:47] Pitju99: I actually don't know why they did that
[4:15:40] Pitju99: it's just for when you are stuck on 300 gold and u still wanna build towards the item
[4:15:41] SpringSong: most of the ap items need that in buıld path so every mid mage benefit
[4:17:09] Pitju99: same colours

[4:19:21] EG_Kel: no NoNo
[4:19:34] KarmicKnight: atleast they gave a quick response
[4:19:59] Pitju99: have you tried the amp tome fleet PoM yet?
[4:20:26] 514484: liandry maligma every single game for 12 months EZ
[4:20:30] jeromefrance: As you like MS, phage can give you on AA  20 ms bonus
[4:20:57] 514484: splitpushmo FeelsGoodMan
[4:21:03] SpringSong: @Pitju99 what?
[4:21:15] KarmicKnight: annie mid?
[4:21:34] Pitju99: @springsong amp tome start setup, costs 400 now so can buy 2 pots with it
[4:21:56] SpringSong: I mean the fleet PoM
[4:22:01] SpringSong: what is that
[4:22:07] Pitju99: presence of mind a footwork
[4:22:26] jeromefrance: @SpringSong what is PoM pls
[4:22:28] KarmicKnight: ghost annie monkaS
[4:22:35] Pitju99: tho I think against annie we need the HP
[4:22:50] jeromefrance: push lane/roam ^^
[4:22:52] SpringSong: @jeromefrance presence of mind Pitju99 said
[4:23:06] Pitju99: Deadge
[4:23:50] Pitju99: I've heard Alan say this matchup is worse than cassio
[4:24:40] KarmicKnight: I wonder how broken stormsurge is on annie
[4:25:07] SpringSong: shadowflame is more treath than ssg on annie imo
[4:25:24] Der_Angelord: ssg = Super Shotgun?
[4:25:27] Der_Angelord: DansGame
[4:25:34] SpringSong: stormsurge
[4:25:37] SpringSong: ssg
[4:25:40] 514484: I'll always like liandory on annie because it makes the bear really scary
[4:26:02] 514484: liandory rylai especially
[4:26:16] jeromefrance: maybe heartsteel build vs otp annie. maybe a bad bet too
[4:26:16] SpringSong: malignant on annie is kinda works too every bear hit makes new aeo burn zone
[4:26:23] 514484: 652 range
[4:26:26] 514484: 625*
[4:27:02] Pitju99: I remember Annie range was nerfed I think it outranged caitlyn before
[4:27:09] 514484: it didn't
[4:27:24] SpringSong: there is no way she could outrange cait
[4:27:43] Pitju99: idk it was similar years ago I feel
[4:27:45] KarmicKnight: any champ outranging cait's AA range sounds absurd
[4:27:52] SpringSong: if that was a think she could be adc
[4:28:02] 514484: it wasn't a thing
[4:28:03] SpringSong: thing*
[4:28:20] SpringSong: im no idea never played annie
[4:28:32] Pitju99: aa range is not the only thing you need to be an adc though
[4:28:46] 514484: yes, the attack is very slow
[4:28:49] jeromefrance: yeah consistent hight ad dmg mainly
[4:29:19] 514484: kennen on the other hand, he had a decent range and was played ADC
[4:29:26] 514484: his range was nerfed
[4:29:54] SpringSong: but longer than cait aa is enough to play a champ in adc role
[4:30:18] 514484: it wasn't longer than cait's, it was the same
[4:30:20] 514484: 650
[4:30:57] Pitju99: oh actually I checked patch notes
[4:31:01] 514484: but that was in season 1, after that range changed a few times
[4:31:27] cenzothefugitif2: Yeah, bcs of the wolf
[4:31:28] usf111: i think because of wolf damage
[4:31:29] Pitju99: she used to have 625 aa range in season 5 that got nerfed to 575
[4:31:42] Pitju99: and it got rebuffed to 625 in season 8
[4:31:45] Pitju99: lol
[4:32:00] Pitju99: misremembered
[4:32:13] jeromefrance: there is also the patch changing aa from center to border to take in the brain
[4:33:02] JayeLau: ugh i got hit with ads
[4:33:05] JayeLau: i missed 1st death
[4:33:59] Pitju99: to be fair cait only has 25 more range than annie
[4:34:03] leequangdai: jebaited PoroSad
[4:34:06] Pitju99: its almost the same
[4:34:55] SpringSong: probably same as ashe @Pitju99
[4:35:14] KarmicKnight: it's crazy annie's finger tips have more range than teemo's blow pipe
[4:35:34] Pitju99: no ashe has 600
[4:36:01] SpringSong: fsat as fck boi
[4:36:06] Pitju99: I dont think any aa outranges annie besides tristana and cait
[4:36:20] leequangdai: annoying loli
[4:36:42] baylife30: @Pitju99 senna
[4:36:58] Der_Angelord: nasus supp new meta? Pog
[4:37:29] SpringSong: @Der_Angelord I dont think so there is always some guy try it but its not meta
[4:37:39] currysos: how can it stack q?
[4:38:03] Pitju99: @baylife30 yeah but senna and trist both need stacks to outrange
[4:38:03] currysos: maybe ap nasus...
[4:38:14] leequangdai: fast rat
[4:38:19] Pitju99: on lvl 1 annie has 50-100 range advantage on almost every adc
[4:38:26] Pitju99: its actually dumb
[4:38:52] 514484: wtf
[4:39:48] GrylloBH: is it taimo mid or top?
[4:40:57] Pitju99: Nasus support is not bad in the right situation it's just rare
[4:41:33] Der_Angelord: Nasus supp seems good vs. purely AA based adcs, not like Lucian or something
[4:41:43] Pitju99: like it's a decent counter against kalista
[4:41:51] Pitju99: probably why he picked it
[4:42:00] GrylloBH: fed rango LUL
[4:42:42] SpringSong: where was the guy said teemo strong cuz winrate %52 KEKW
[4:43:15] currysos: rengar will carry I think
[4:43:21] SgpFubar: @SpringSong Once again you keep lying about what I said KEKW
[4:43:34] SgpFubar: Your ego is quite hight Spring
[4:43:36] SgpFubar: high*
[4:43:49] Der_Angelord: I think taimo will carry :)
[4:43:55] Der_Angelord: (in the next game)
[4:44:10] currysos: as always
[4:44:13] SpringSong: @SgpFubar saying isnt weak mean strong? if its not weak like you said what it can be ? lol if you say not weak = strong if you say not strong=weak ?
[4:44:39] SgpFubar: @SpringSong ? So strong and weak are only too options? Is balanced not a thing?
[4:44:51] SgpFubar: Stronger than last season means OP for you @SpringSong ?
[4:44:52] SgpFubar: LUL
[4:44:55] SpringSong: you think teemo balanced? lol
[4:45:00] SpringSong: what balanced mean to you
[4:45:22] SgpFubar: Neither needing a buff or a nerf to mantain a WR close to 50%
[4:45:29] SpringSong: %52 winrate teemo isnt weak that what you said dont change your words
[4:45:35] Rhae47: @SgpFubar this is a good definition
[4:45:58] SpringSong: teemo need to change his R so basically need buff he cant do anything to carry a team
[4:46:08] SpringSong: so that mean teemo is weak rn
[4:46:09] Raidhunter0: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[4:46:11] Pitju99: I think teemo is a bit above average but not crazy, and just ok at the highest lvl soloq
[4:46:40] SgpFubar: @SpringSong LUL
[4:46:50] SpringSong: @Pitju99 I didnt see anyone carry a loser team with teemo so idk
[4:47:43] Pitju99: high tier aatrox is broken
[4:47:47] Pitju99: and teemo is ok
[4:48:17] SpringSong: for capability to carry a loser team
[4:48:36] Pitju99: winrate didnt drop much only around 1% winrate lost
[4:48:48] SgpFubar: @SpringSong So thats the definition if a champ should be nerfed or buffed? if he can carry a loser team? LUL
[4:48:58] SgpFubar: Glad you dont work for riot
[4:49:14] Pitju99: I've seen a lot of non onetricks do well on teemo they just kinda have no reason to play him
[4:49:26] Pitju99: teemo players play teemo cause they like to
[4:49:54] SpringSong: @SgpFubar what is that buffed or nerfed sbject come from we talked about champs current position weak or not for buff and nerf devs dont look it only 1 league
[4:49:57] DingleDingDer: Who should be the #1 ban in toplane be against top?
[4:50:18] Rhae47: @SgpFubar 70% winrate but cant carry a team so they're probably weak
[4:50:31] serrolo: i play teemo because i have fun playing teemo and building different teemo tthan a regular teemo full ap
[4:50:38] Cudi_Gaveta: Teemo
[4:50:39] SpringSong: @Pattrick_Briddington which %70 cant carry a team lol?
[4:51:36] Pitju99: but then teemo will get nerfed again
[4:52:02] Pitju99: teemo is still really broken in low tier
[4:52:51] SpringSong: @Pitju99 yea because low tier even whole 30 min dont get red radar and control ward to clean shroom
[4:53:51] Pitju99: people complain when Teemo is good so I expect another nerf
[4:53:59] Pitju99: its coming soon enough
[4:54:48] Jadistk: Whoa they show names again in champ select? Thank god
[4:55:08] Pitju99: @jadistk not in ranked, this is normal
[4:55:18] Jadistk: ahh
[4:56:14] stormbj0rn: Nice gu
[4:56:17] stormbj0rn: y

[4:59:05] Cudi_Gaveta: malakSenta
[4:59:38] SpringSong: well they gona work on signed I guess rework income for him
[4:59:43] Pitju99: I see skarner once every 2 months
[4:59:56] Pitju99: he barely exists
[5:00:13] matiko280: rip ad skarner
[5:00:18] garlicsaucekebab: singed split push sounds bad given that he's incredibly usefull in fights
[5:00:35] garlicsaucekebab: but i know marvin got GM with hullbreaker singed..
[5:01:55] Pitju99: gave it to aatrox LUL
[5:02:06] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: it's a jungel diff
[5:02:46] Pitju99: it's actually better than if rengar got it
[5:03:00] Cudi_Gaveta: Pink ficou fora da muita
[5:03:24] 514484: man aatrox is tilting to even see, i hate that little dash he does to surprise you
[5:03:25] Honourable_Sir_Tucancap: was poppy looking for top gank and when teemo recalled she just invaded?
[5:03:49] soier1: AP :)
[5:03:53] Nyoomes: ap
[5:04:04] Pitju99: ad against rengar sounds difficult
[5:06:28] Pitju99: at least Aatrox also has no mana
[5:06:45] TheSteve: bruh LUL
[5:07:35] JayeLau: !cannon
[5:08:31] leequangdai: push into mushroom DinoDance
[5:09:42] serrolo: the problem with teemo is that everybody wants to kill you
[5:09:43] GrylloBH: it's okayge they got destroyed for his roam
[5:10:05] Bluichu: LOL
[5:10:08] Bluichu: blitz

[5:14:41] VoodooChild420: then forfit
[5:14:47] GrylloBH: they just wanted to bully u
[5:17:05] topposan2000: top is the most important lane on the current meta, that's why they all came to top i guess.

[5:28:37] Kadruzil: hilarious
[5:29:35] omgodfather: @le_bazar_de_lotaku goddammed why?
[5:39:34] omgodfather: Why they removed demonic embrace?
[5:39:42] omgodfather: I liked to play it on Tahm kench!
[5:40:52] 514484: warmo PogBones

[5:46:16] 514484: demonic wasn't great
[5:46:41] caciuslove: prerry gg
[5:46:50] lui235: unlucky team
[5:47:02] DontFeedPenguins: @omgodfather malignant is better than demonic
[5:47:46] TurcoDiDdioh: why he died
[5:48:00] TurcoDiDdioh: ah collector?
[5:48:10] iohah: that's why I don't pick senna vs assasin jng.. if your adc is passive af, you are guaranteed 2-3 deaths befere you realize you can't play the game
[5:48:52] omgodfather: @dontfeedpenguins can you combine that item with liandrys or no?
[5:49:19] kleentz: Lmao he has ult again
[5:49:44] 514484: 14 deaths and 11 deaths bot, another argument against my return to this game EZ
[5:50:10] lui235: troll botlane
[5:50:44] DontFeedPenguins: @omgodfather you can
[5:50:46] Lensendlot: is warmogs teemo viable chat? With grasp and overgrowth + haunting guis (into laindry) ?
[5:51:08] KaXaSA: 3 adc vs jax/kayn KEKWait
[5:51:21] Lensendlot: missed the start of the round, did he go liandry into warmogs or the other way around?
[5:53:09] 514484: does warmog stil give AH?
[5:53:23] Lensendlot: @514484 don't think so, but out of combat ms
[5:54:02] Lazynameross: kayn and sej hmm
[5:56:39] 514484: out of combnat ms? no
[5:57:12] Lazynameross: "and gain 10% bonus movement speed if damage has not been taken in the last 6 seconds (3 seconds for damage from non-champions)."
[5:57:19] Lazynameross: c+p from wiki
[5:57:33] 514484: interesting
[5:57:47] Lensendlot: and 5% ms base on the item
[5:57:49] Lazynameross: confirmed no H BTW
[5:57:54] Lazynameross: ah*
[5:57:57] Lazynameross: -caps
[5:58:35] Lensendlot: Damn, clean escape
[5:58:42] 514484: deleting kayn any second now, i believe in rito
[5:58:56] iohah: LuL could waste more of his time there
[5:58:59] Lazynameross: Smadging hecarim
[5:59:14] Lensendlot: what do you guys think of full ap shroomo?
[5:59:42] 514484: it's the default build
[6:00:03] Lensendlot: i've been struggling with the new shroom spots
[6:01:14] iohah: not good at all, you are supposed to disrupt enemy team, you won't kill them if you go full ap - maybe in low elo, but there everything works
[6:02:06] Lensendlot: @iohah so, more a mixed version with nashors onhit and tanky stuff?
[6:02:17] Lensendlot: have not played much teemo since s14
[6:02:56] Lazynameross: the item jhin wants
[6:03:05] Lazynameross: isnt for stealth and dashes?
[6:04:10] iohah: watch the stream - iPav is the best person to show builds - for me swift boots and something for attack speed (nashor/botrk) is basically full build, you won't scale much more after that
[6:10:03] GblGlacier: Gzuz
[6:11:59] Lazynameross: rip
[6:13:28] OrbitalPeacock: what a champ
[6:13:50] razer_mon: RAAT

[6:31:32] 514484: the nerf doesn't change anything about mages and assassins shitting on him
[6:32:00] 514484: unless of course you are low enough elo that the enemy mids are bad
[6:32:15] LeondorGaming: i'm like gold and it is. i'm playing mid, starting malignance then either liandry or shadowflame
[6:32:18] serrolo: try lich bane
[6:32:26] 514484: in gold you can play it for sure
[6:33:01] LeondorGaming: thx for the advice
[6:34:32] serrolo: try lich bane instead of malignance
[6:34:39] KarmicKnight: malignance might help more in team fights than d cap
[6:35:46] Korianter5: are u asking for real or ?
[6:35:48] serrolo: i do not like malignance it's a no no for me
[6:36:59] 514484: maligma is a CDR item, ignore the effect, do you want CDR or not, that's the question

[7:00:44] Lensendlot: bro is suicidal
[7:01:05] Lensendlot: runnin top straight down
[7:01:15] SpringSong: he tought he gona stun under tower
[7:01:39] r3nt0n7: yeah i think so
[7:01:55] Lensendlot: One gives adaptive force, one gives another thing and one gives 1 ability point
[7:02:06] 514484: the other two elixirs are fucking useless
[7:02:19] 514484: but this, this can be scary monkaS
[7:02:22] Lensendlot: nah the level one is insane on udyr f.e.
[7:02:23] Lazynameross: how is that useless lol
[7:02:27] Lensendlot: 1 more ability point
[7:02:47] 514484: think about it
[7:02:58] Lazynameross: champs that depend on lvl 9 would love it
[7:03:13] 514484: what champs depend that much on lvl9 ?
[7:03:19] Lensendlot: get clapped pikachu
[7:03:22] KarmicKnight: lmao his poor kennen
[7:03:25] Lazynameross: urgot
[7:03:34] Lensendlot: indeed
[7:03:50] Lazynameross: idk who else gets a massive stat on skill max off top of head
[7:04:11] 514484: you get the exliir at lvl 9 right? you would have maxed your skill either way
[7:04:14] Lazynameross: or if a rank 2 in an off skill makes a rather nice diff
[7:04:51] Lazynameross: these elixers pop earlier dont they? lemme check
[7:04:56] 514484: 3 6 9
[7:05:14] Lensendlot: @514484 either way, i think udyr can utilize that massiveley
[7:05:16] 514484: so it's just a secvond point for your second skill
[7:05:21] 514484: seems super meh
[7:05:34] SpringSong: meh
[7:05:46] Migral500: lol kennen couldnt see nothing with noc ult
[7:06:02] Lazynameross: u right, thought it was time gated
[7:06:24] Lazynameross: still not agreeing its useless tho lol just niche
[7:06:45] Lensendlot: i mean you could combine it with rod of ages, to get 1 more lvl up + 1 point, that is 2 ability points for free
[7:06:50] 514484: i think it's super useless, almost cosmectic compared to the lvl 6 one
[7:07:17] 514484: maybe i'm wrong
[7:07:23] Lazynameross: or a champ that actually has an option to max a diff skill first
[7:07:27] razer_mon: he got MONKED
[7:07:31] SpringSong: @Lensendlot I'm still dont think that good
[7:08:17] 514484: at least it's another option for that forsaken tree
[7:08:31] Lensendlot: @SpringSong on pbe you could keep it for lvl 10 and use it to get your r to lvl 2, but they removed that sadly
[7:09:13] Lensendlot: that would have actually been pretty strong, getting lvl 10, all in your oponent with an lvl 2 ult
[7:09:25] SpringSong: @Lensendlot that could be awesome
[7:09:39] Lazynameross: removing stopwatch to give rank 2 ult earlier kinda xd
[7:09:41] SpringSong: sit rat! KEKW
[7:10:01] SpringSong: @Lazynameross its not give rank 2 ult early now
[7:10:01] Lensendlot: damn 4 legged lasagne
[7:10:04] SpringSong: is it?
[7:10:10] Lensendlot: it isn't
[7:10:13] CleanKing_: minion ruined it
[7:10:14] Lensendlot: they removed that sadly
[7:10:16] Lazynameross: ik but if they didnt fix it
[7:10:48] Lazynameross: kass timer on 15 now lol
[7:10:49] SpringSong: then everyone gona rush that elixir and roa champs like kassa could be cancer af
[7:11:08] Lazynameross: also the og elixer of skill didnt rank ult
[7:11:20] Lazynameross: at least not by the time it was removed
[7:11:27] razer_mon: rat got ratted out
[7:11:32] CleanKing_: wait that items gives a shield now?
[7:11:47] Lensendlot: banshee and the item you build it from
