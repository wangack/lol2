[0:00:49] bubblegumfro: How do trees fart?
[0:01:53] MedicCasts: !fact
[0:01:54] StreamElements: Trees release excess methane produced by microbes in the plant. This is basically farting if you stretch the definition, which I did for it to be a cool fact.
[0:02:09] bubblegumfro: Awesome
[0:02:30] bubblegumfro: Are they better or worse than cows?
[0:02:41] MedicCasts: much better for the environment
[0:02:48] MedicCasts: Not sure about the smell :P
[0:03:14] moony_jpg: bonjour
[0:03:23] bubblegumfro: justky3RISE justky3RISE justky3RISE
[0:03:53] moony_jpg: discord bot appears to still be in Bedge
[0:04:03] MedicCasts: I wish i were still in Bedge
[0:04:10] moony_jpg: fair
[0:04:13] MedicCasts: Will give it 5 mins then start
[0:04:14] moony_jpg: same
[0:04:20] MedicCasts: need to finish making my coffee
[0:04:32] almightydps1454: im never inhaling oxygen from a tree ever again, disgusting man xdd
[0:04:32] moony_jpg: medicSip
[0:04:41] LlandriGaming: Good luck with your games today, I wish I was in bed too but my son is ill and off school and firing his nerf guns which is giving me a headache so I retreated downstairs
[0:05:03] moony_jpg: @LlandriGaming  medicHug
[0:05:32] arbine: hello
[0:05:51] arbine: how does the new studio feel? Is it much different? Any favorite improvements?
[0:06:06] Sjobbe: Hello
[0:06:15] moony_jpg: @Sjobbe  medicHi
[0:06:42] Sjobbe: @moony_jpg medicHi
[0:07:34] moony_jpg: bot has risen
[0:07:47] pepsio: I was waiting for u on LCK cast Sadge

[0:07:59] l_Kage_l: hi Medic! did you lose weight recently?
[0:08:01] jupelele: u watching rekkles today?=
[0:08:03] arbine: The haircut shocked me so hard when I watched some on the first day. xD
[0:08:28] crispytain: WeirdChamp
[0:08:51] l_Kage_l: Yeah, sorry, you're right! my bad on that one
[0:08:55] remixlol1: Omg its the real Medic live

[0:09:18] alekun17: happ hello hello
[0:09:18] l_Kage_l: Yep, appreciate it, didn't take it as such
[0:09:25] jupelele: @jupelele lolesport and caedrel will be streaming it
[0:09:25] MedicCasts: twitch.tv/chron1cler
[0:09:26] HappyBenchClub: thx
[0:09:35] Necrosity: Haircut is going back to starting days of medic, just missing the glasses now
[0:09:37] Squallly: hey Moony!  how are you today? :)
[0:09:38] arbine: what I also missed: are casters still "in" the studio, i.e. between fans and players?
[0:10:09] moony_jpg: @Squallly not great, unfortunately noone can cover my shift so it's painkillers and bite through it
[0:10:21] moony_jpg: how're you and squally?
[0:10:23] moony_jpg: sammy
[0:10:25] moony_jpg: ffs, brain
[0:10:31] remixlol1: Are you tired or sad? Could be either rn :D
[0:10:37] arbine: hes painting a penis
[0:10:38] arbine: great
[0:10:48] Sjobbe: It's a face
[0:10:50] arbine: ah, but no more fist bumps?! :(
[0:11:07] Squallly: @moony_jpg I'm still a bit tired from the London day trip yesterday (it was a 5.45am wake-up and didn't get home until 9.45pm)
[0:11:14] arbine: I always found the setup with the casters right next to fans & players really really really cool
[0:11:21] bangbingpoww: How good is MAD actually? would u rate them over teams like Rogue, BD?
[0:11:24] bangbingpoww: BDS*
[0:11:31] simonwutface: @MedicCasts  have there been any fans who tryed to interuppt the games?
[0:11:31] Squallly: Sammy is sleepy too though (which is helpful because it's sub-zero this morning!)
[0:11:32] l_Kage_l: Is this something new that was introduced recently? The Co-streaming booths?
[0:11:42] LlandriGaming: looks like mundo
[0:11:45] Gaslord90: @Sjobbe it's a face indeed! :D
[0:11:51] Stugini: Im guessing venue security has stepped up with the fan situ
[0:12:09] moony_jpg: @Squallly it was -6 when i brought crumb to daycare this morning
[0:12:20] Squallly: has the atmosphere in the studio changed a lot this year?  (obviously it seems quite different on broadcast, but that might be due to audio set-up, etc)
[0:12:27] crispytain: thoughts on SK being the best team in the worlds and getting the golden road the next 3 years?
[0:12:29] crackitotita: Hey Medic !
[0:12:35] moony_jpg: should have gone to horso straight after but went back to bed cause yeah, don't want to die
[0:12:36] Necrosity: Do you think that the new atmosphere is going to provoke people going out of bounds aswell?
[0:12:39] crackitotita: Irrelvant was huge
[0:12:46] shura_yasha: fnatic based xdd
[0:13:06] TUNDRAEUW: WHERE HAIR
[0:13:07] TUNDRAEUW: WHY ARE BALD
[0:13:14] Squallly: is that good for you as a caster?  i'm guessing it pumps you up? :)
[0:13:25] moony_jpg: i needed ear plugs for season finals, guess i should get some for LEC as well then
[0:13:30] P4n_luca: Suuurely
[0:13:37] TUNDRAEUW: whjere is the germanic tribesman
[0:14:23] Necrosity: sodaNOTE
[0:14:43] Stugini: The PGL location was super cool
[0:14:59] simonwutface: @MedicCasts  have there been anytime during lec that Fans have done somthing stupid during the games ?
[0:15:16] Airfire: When Sjokz brought those casters onto the desk just randomly, that was a stroke of genius by her
[0:15:19] dwakndwa: Do you think it is an advantage that the studio doesn
[0:15:22] zaxoskam: is it a new studio completly or the rebuild the old?
[0:15:27] P4n_luca: How annoying is the drum in the studio? I even dislike them if its in a big arena personally
[0:15:28] shura_yasha: any info on the lck cl english cast situation?
[0:15:29] Anymos__: Good morning Medic, how's life?
[0:15:33] moony_jpg: still can't believe i got tickets for a weekend when you're not there
[0:15:53] dwakndwa: Do you think it is an advantage that the studio doesn't have a lot of seats for controlling the crowd?
[0:16:08] MedicCasts: twitch.tv/chron1cler 󠀀
[0:16:16] shura_yasha: cool
[0:16:22] shromodi: thanks alot <3
[0:16:33] crispytain: not having eng youtube stream and game audio feels pretty bad tho
[0:17:11] Zibw: ive had long hair for years what was it like to cut urs off
[0:17:16] moony_jpg: we can't see your screen
[0:18:08] micioed: do you feel the way especially kc fans approach the sport (football-ultras like) can work in esports? i'm not really a fan of it, but it's just mainly cause here in Italy it gets really heated with football and tbh it kinda scares me sometimes
[0:18:11] stenniwastaken: we need cages like in stadiums
[0:18:32] Anymos__: I do not think anything would happen, CSGO majors and tournaments crowds are 10x more "crazier" but nothing happens, but who knows XD
[0:18:34] stenniwastaken: juventus
[0:18:40] umorakii: what cages bro they are people not monkeys
[0:18:49] mrpandy3: good morning everyone
[0:18:52] TUNDRAEUW: @umorakii have you seen kc fans
[0:18:52] alekun17: i remember that one day i had red spots on my head because i had too much hair xdd
[0:18:59] stenniwastaken: my ultras still celebrate it, and that speaks to the quality of ultras
[0:19:02] Genewen: Moin Medic
[0:19:24] Perseus6: Was there an incident at lec?
[0:19:27] Gaslord90: Trees farting the air we breath?
[0:19:33] TUNDRAEUW: i think trash talk is needed in competitive sports
[0:19:37] moony_jpg: @Gaslord90 !fact
[0:19:42] moony_jpg: no?
[0:19:49] purebread29: can you sniff the trees fart
[0:19:54] MedicCasts: !fact
[0:19:54] StreamElements: Trees release excess methane produced by microbes in the plant. This is basically farting if you stretch the definition, which I did for it to be a cool fact.
[0:19:59] DumpSplash: Why are there so few seats in regular season, is it because of cost?
[0:20:00] Necrosity: Elyoya took it well though
[0:20:02] Laan_c: just look at how cod esports is/used to be
[0:20:05] moony_jpg: ahh
[0:20:06] Laan_c: seems more insufferable than hype
[0:20:14] Perseus6: Personally I hope they will buffer LEC more because it's hard to watch the game with commentary with the feedback from your mics picking it up
[0:20:18] trulmb: i wanna sniff a trees fart. mmmmh
[0:20:18] TUNDRAEUW: its unbelievably cringe imo that they boo in situations like that
[0:20:22] TUNDRAEUW: when they bood faker as well
[0:20:45] PlzN0: hello people
[0:20:54] Gaslord90: @moony_jpg but plants do produce oxygen?
[0:21:01] moony_jpg: they do
[0:21:09] Anymos__: CSGO majors always had that type of atmosphere and those tournmanets are great to watch. Though in smaller arena, I can see that it is annoying, but in general is fine
[0:21:13] moony_jpg: but that is the chlorophyll in the leaves
[0:21:22] moony_jpg: wait no
[0:21:25] moony_jpg: whatever
[0:21:27] moony_jpg: brain dead
[0:21:29] stenniwastaken: even in football booing is rare
[0:21:45] The_Mishiah: you've not been to a football match then
[0:21:51] Perseus6: Let's be real some teams only have like a couple of fans live
[0:22:05] hayleeejay: I went to a German football game a few weeks ago and was amazed with the passion, the best crowd I’ve ever seen and both sides passionate FOR their team not AGAINST the other team
[0:22:07] DumpSplash: if you cast from another room wont hear them
[0:22:22] Airfire: Am I extremely rare in the sense that I just enjoy watching the LEC and am not a 'fan' of really nay of the teams? I just like to keep up with what's going on?
[0:22:34] stenniwastaken: esports fans need to pick up the chant gane
[0:22:39] self_lesss: I stoped watching the lec stream at Saturday after second game where the fans were louder than casters
[0:23:04] moony_jpg: @stenniwastaken fnc kc "go home kcorp" was kinda funny
[0:23:24] dwakndwa: BB said he struggled to hear his teammates during the KC match. Could this cause match integrity issues?
[0:23:44] hayleeejay: yeah surely at that point it’s coming through in game as well
[0:23:49] remixlol1: Maybe I dont see the full picture but doesnt a glas just fix most of these problems?
[0:24:03] Heartybeast: @remixlol1 madness
[0:24:21] hayleeejay: they don’t want to put up barriers between players and fans - has been a thing of Riots from the start
[0:24:27] Stugini: I think to an extent you can ignore / talk over the stadium fans during intv, they are for the broadcast more than those choosing to boo / cheer over it
[0:24:31] moony_jpg: lmao
[0:24:33] stenniwastaken: it also is incredibly shameful even in ultras logic
[0:24:33] scratterboon: LEC main cast unwatchable now, football style chants doesnt work for esports
[0:24:56] Airfire: I kind of dislike booing in general also
[0:25:09] simonwutface: @MedicCasts  is food allowed  inside What Happens if fans end up throwing it on the players?
[0:25:11] Squallly: (minus the dodgy money shifting)
[0:25:19] Heartybeast: Very expensive and no litter?
[0:25:25] The_Mishiah: No, dodgy money shifting is a plus
[0:25:27] self_lesss: Good to hear that you guys are working on a solution
[0:25:29] BluhIce: Pog nazi gold inside of the lec studio to find
[0:25:31] 2gooden: yellow font black background is back
[0:25:34] 2gooden: morning all!
[0:25:38] FroGGyWatchah: I just came in, what the hell is going on
[0:25:43] Anymos__: But would you say Medic, that energy and even booing is better than hearing 0 crowd interaction or sound, as it happened in Korea where if Korean team is not playing, it is just silence
[0:25:58] dwakndwa: So you u are saying there might be some there Hmm
[0:26:02] Perseus6: I do hope they fix the fact your mics pick up the fans
[0:26:31] roars59: GG 🌞🏃‍♂️Happy🌞morning🌞🤸‍♀️🌞🏃‍♂️Enjoy💕Stream💕
[0:26:39] moony_jpg: in comparison to season finals in montpellier, how is the noise level?
[0:26:41] Anymos__: Yeah of course, it is just sad sometimes to hear 0 crowd energy. I love CSGO majors, where passion is there, but not overly disrespectful. Oh my team lost, fuck it
[0:26:44] scratterboon: or mindless football chants for the whole game
[0:26:44] umorakii: its toxic kids or early 20 years old i think that behave like that
[0:27:10] Bizzleberry: bring back TSM chants
[0:27:15] Sittinpull: was it the years before also a thing, that a lot of people go home before the last game?
[0:27:24] Blaqdot: I find that during games the casters' voices get a bit drowned out by the noise in the crowd. Maybe caster mics can filter out some of the crowd noise a bit more
[0:27:47] Perseus6: I think you have to move the casters then prob to make it work
[0:27:53] DumpSplash: When i was young i joined some cheering squad, they were drunk and on drugs to manage cheering for a 2 hour football game so thats where aggression sometimes comes from xD
[0:28:02] Gergzilla: Does PaCO2 rise in a patient with an asthma attack? I got this question on an exam
[0:28:20] Necrosity: It started being more prominent with G2 and Vitality last year, i feel like. Now MadKoi and KCorp just bumped it up like 2 levels LUL
[0:28:23] scratterboon: only when it gets bad enough
[0:28:27] scratterboon: goes down first
[0:28:49] l3goghoul: Your handwriting looks like a doctor's
[0:28:51] moony_jpg: educational stream medicNoted
[0:28:55] Gergzilla: I said the body would compensate by hyperventilating, but it will rise and PaO2 will fall
[0:29:20] BluhIce: now that lec discussion and medical facts get mixed up the board becomes truely unhinged KEKL
[0:29:35] Gergzilla: Okay cool
[0:29:42] nelanbarrow: will you join caedrel stream, on 21 jan ?
[0:29:53] LordGrox: medics paint boards truly are modern abstract art huh
[0:30:05] Genewen: @BluhIce combine it and see how we can induce asthma attacks in the viewers so they can't jeer during interviews
[0:30:08] remixlol1: Post this painting on twitter please, let people guess what topic it was
[0:30:21] Squallly: @LordGrox you can buy a print of it for €20
[0:30:30] Sittinpull: !doctor
[0:30:30] StreamElements: I studied at Norwich Medical School and actually worked as a doctor for a year in the UK before becoming a full time caster! For more watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQCYzqmnRwI&t=659s
[0:30:36] Anymos__: Overall, what would you add in the new arena?
[0:30:38] self_lesss: is viewership rly up? i know that me and all my buddies turned off the stream bcs it wasnt watchable, can imagine that alot other people did the same
[0:30:38] LordGrox: pogg
[0:30:45] Jafilip: 1st message.
[0:30:45] hayleeejay: yeah disappointing the teams themselves haven’t called out poor behaviour
[0:30:50] The_Mishiah: Add some skill hehe
[0:31:16] Anymos__: That is fair
[0:31:19] jblomma00: Would it be an option to have the interview after the game backstage if the crowd is being to loud?
[0:31:20] remixlol1: Would you say you´d want MDK + KC to make playoffs because that surely increases viewers vor playoffs?
[0:31:30] dwakndwa: peak viewership was 741 450
[0:31:32] PlzN0: i was expecting more tech issues and pauses tbh
[0:31:40] vodkazingo: I just joined the stream and I have no clue what I'm looking at woah
[0:31:44] KrollV: Just tuned in, what is this?
[0:31:52] moony_jpg: @KrollV LEC and medical facts
[0:32:22] Airfire: Nisqy was loving it right?
[0:32:30] Anymos__: It feels weird to do it backstage, also it is not like KC fans are going on stage attacking him.
[0:32:35] crispytain: just came back after 15 min what on earth is on the screen
[0:32:37] SCRAAATCH: I feel like I just walked in on a physics lecture 50 minutes in
[0:32:44] Ztreeg: am I supposed to be able to read this image
[0:33:10] BluhIce: KC fans gotta boo they probably won't have much to cheer for this split KEKL
[0:33:14] crispytain: NOOO I MISSED THE ASTHMA SECTION :(((((
[0:33:18] remixlol1: Would you say you´d want MDK + KC to make playoffs because that surely increases viewers vor playoffs?
[0:33:19] Airfire: Did you enjoy the games Medic
[0:33:21] Genewen: pretty sure this image is summoning demons on my screen
[0:33:32] Cheznoid: Are you enjoying it ?
[0:33:33] juliyx: The stadium looked very empty for the last game, did that happen before that so many fans leave?
[0:33:37] crispytain: Nerdge
[0:33:47] moony_jpg: how's the noise level in comparison to season finals?
[0:33:51] pedra45: u think u guys can do fan interviews pre-games? maybe then air them pre-recorded
[0:33:56] arbine: one question that's worrying me since more then a year... Do you think LEC could get into the same issues that LCS has?
[0:34:03] Bizzleberry: What was the most banned/picked support in lec this week?
[0:34:08] PlzN0: lec fixed it, they put kc games last
[0:34:09] pedra45: i loved LCS old fan interviews
[0:34:41] Perseus6: Will they solve all the technical issues? And if you can't solve the background and feedback issue will there be a cast with just caster and game? Because I couldn't watch all the games because of the noice.
[0:35:31] crispytain: @Bizzleberry ashe/renata
[0:35:36] Cheznoid: Monday is pretty significant change also because its monday
[0:35:40] Genewen: how many did fit in the old setup?
[0:35:53] moony_jpg: 170 something?
[0:36:36] KrollV: I mean all weeks are sold out like this first one, I'm not sure if its gonna be less people
[0:36:41] Bizzleberry: @crispytain oh really ashe support was popular?
[0:36:56] dwakndwa: Do you think KC fans will keep the beef going next week trough the BDS vs MDK match?
[0:37:16] Bizzleberry: ooh thats a pwetty site
[0:37:20] Anymos__: Issue with LCS is that people in USA prefer other games and prefer consoles a lot more than in rest of the countries
[0:37:35] TralphT: Are you watching rekkles debut?
[0:37:41] shade97485: What's the best support champ rn?
[0:37:45] Bizzleberry: red side is also my highest winrate by far i think too
[0:38:36] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[0:38:56] Rockatona: Hi, what do you think about SK? Are they tier A team or they just met with weak teams,
[0:39:02] Rockatona: *?
[0:39:06] crispytain: is there an ms paint category?
[0:39:11] crispytain: on twitch
[0:39:25] Genewen: "Arts and Crafts"
[0:39:34] novakellsa: wait there's no tech rehersal?
[0:39:52] PlzN0: would u need a 2nd "stage" in the back for rehearsal on game days for just that?
[0:40:39] LlandriGaming: I enjoyed the LCK season launch when they ran a competition between the roles. Was a good way of doing this testing whilst also creating content
[0:40:53] novakellsa: what would a dress reshersal look like for pro players?
[0:41:24] ez_pop123: AINTNOWAY
[0:42:16] BluhIce: when does LEC get the hotfix or was it already this week ?

[0:43:28] DumpSplash: make teams scrim in studio?

[0:43:42] gojosatoru777: xdd
[0:43:52] Pamoth: Did they teach you to write like this at Medic School? xdd

[0:44:21] moony_jpg: how much do i donate for you to get you a graphics tablet
[0:44:24] dwakndwa: Didn't that happen with Guma during msi?
[0:44:24] LlandriGaming: If only there was some device you could buy to put text on a screen
[0:44:26] DumpSplash: open a math teacher on youtube you'd be surprised xD
[0:44:33] Sprinklerz: dr handwriting kek
[0:44:44] RobinTheCatbird: Interesting title! Can you elaborate on how trees fart, cause I don't get it PrideCute
[0:44:45] markzuuu: hiii

[0:45:58] Pamoth: Can you make another league cinematic please Medic, the last one slaps
[0:45:58] sim4ecav2: Will you play at all ?
[0:46:00] crispytain: SK BLANKIES
[0:46:03] AnZ0n: Is the studio being used on days when LEC is not happening?
[0:46:12] cotran61: Show a thumbs up if ur in a good mood, I got you on mute and cant go up with volume ok
[0:46:15] crispytain: any news on lec pop quiz?
[0:46:18] gojosatoru777: is akali gigabroken rn ?

[0:46:40] DarthSven13: What do you think about the costreaming in the arena?
[0:46:44] nelanbarrow: Ksante still op af kekw
[0:46:53] crispytain: thought you might be in it or something idk
[0:47:04] hellket__: Hows the atmosphere this year in studio? It feels fresh and fun to watch..
[0:47:14] ez_pop123: im sad that there is going to be no big stadium for winter,spring and summer
[0:47:26] KrollV: Wasnt there someone from G2 who raided on sunday?
[0:47:31] gojosatoru777: kesha ganking pedro xdd
[0:47:33] Pamoth: Do you have much security working at the studio?
[0:47:42] StreamElements: moony_jpg just tipped €20.00 PogChamp
[0:47:44] nelanbarrow: will security guards be place naer the streamers ?
[0:47:56] moony_jpg: there was a messae
[0:47:57] hykn0t: if they threaten player feeling of safety alone is already really fckin bad ngl
[0:48:04] Rodnelas: i missed lec yesterday i look to twitter and see fanbases go against eachother what did i miss
[0:48:18] ScotiaStreams: ScotiaStreams subscribed with Prime. 
[0:48:19] moony_jpg: yeah
[0:48:34] moony_jpg: i said "go buy a graphics tablet and save your chat's eyes"
[0:48:44] Nica_Joker: I just feel like it's sad/ a little disrespectful for fans to just leave in bulk after teams lose. Makes the entire hype lose its meaning.
[0:48:47] nelanbarrow: @Rodnelas mad defeated kc
[0:48:51] killerwa1rus: or a whiteboard?
[0:49:06] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:49:10] hykn0t: did you cast any other esport before league?
[0:49:13] Airfire: I have one but not sure how easy it would be to ship to Berlin from the UK vicksyThink
[0:49:14] KiccDacc: The drum felt a bit much for that small arena, looked intense on broadcast
[0:49:15] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas ahn i see, anything i missed from the games
[0:49:23] Rodnelas: any hot takes after week 1 @MedicCasts
[0:49:38] Pamoth: @KiccDacc Caps' dad though so too according to Pedro
[0:49:39] maverickrainn: @Rodnelas same
[0:50:00] ez_pop123: the booing of eloyoya was weird but supa did shush the kc fans lol. what were your thoughts on that
[0:50:36] hykn0t: i wonder what kind of gigs took you up to the big casts
[0:50:45] Silfel: Sadly feels on brand for the league community peepoSad
[0:50:52] Davitzon: Have any takes/picks for the League Hall of Fame thing?
[0:50:53] KrollV: @ez_pop123 KC Bood when the players entered the arena, i feel like the shushing for that is fine tbh
[0:50:59] Raur: Can't script a live audience FeelsBadMan
[0:51:00] maverickrainn: they so loud KC Fans is so anannoying
[0:51:36] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[0:51:48] KiccDacc: Booing him felt so disrespectful and he took it like a champ and was professional. Hats off to him
[0:51:53] nelanbarrow: when was the last time was there such rivalry
[0:51:54] ez_pop123: doing att that during med school is crazy haha
[0:51:58] ez_pop123: all
[0:52:27] smellytwitchchatuser: go4lol pog
[0:52:45] ez_pop123: no
[0:52:46] Perseus6: I think you should start with Faker regardless
[0:52:47] Airfire: @KiccDacc I disagree the booing of Supa was disrespectful. He provoked them and it was fan and rival interaction
[0:52:47] ez_pop123: he retired
[0:52:50] Pamoth: Do you think they should back fill for the other years?
[0:53:10] dwakndwa: With the faker choosing ori over ahri it seems like they might choose him regardless
[0:53:10] Rodnelas: i feel like hall of fame will be dominated by lck and lpl players and non asian players wont get in there
[0:53:19] KiccDacc: @Airfire in an interview its not acceptable
[0:53:20] Rodnelas: like i think xpeke deserves to be in there maybe
[0:53:21] Annibal: Diamondprox HOF when
[0:53:27] hellket__: How about M5 or Taipei Assasins love S1/S2/S3 - pionneers of game the international game recognition..
[0:53:30] Necrosity: xPeke or Yellowstar?
[0:53:30] AAAleksi: Agreed
[0:53:32] KiccDacc: Its disrespectful not only to him but the interviewer and broadcast
[0:53:46] Perseus6: I don't know people who retire come back anyway and i think Faker should be the exception if you have that rule because obviously it's faker
[0:54:01] Pamoth: I hope that they induct 1 player from each region
[0:54:12] Raur: Would it not make more senses to induct 1x retired player from each major region?
[0:54:17] Raur: more snse*
[0:54:22] SweTexx: theshy lpl xdd
[0:54:24] ez_pop123: doinb
[0:54:26] Raur: FailFish
[0:54:27] maverickrainn: Caps
[0:54:32] Roktaz: xPeke
[0:54:33] hellket__: dont say XPEKE
[0:54:33] Pamoth: xpeke
[0:54:34] Tebrevet: xPeke
[0:54:37] Perseus6: Xpeke
[0:54:37] maverickrainn: ohh
[0:54:41] novakellsa: tbh Faker would be a boring first inductee
[0:54:45] Nica_Joker: I just think booing shows disrespect to the player/team, especially after the game. And a certain group of fans sadly has a history with doing it even unprovoked...
[0:54:47] Raur: Yellowstar
[0:54:48] Rodnelas: yellowstar
[0:54:53] Raur: NODDERS
[0:54:53] elBoss44: khan
[0:54:56] Rodnelas: if rekkles wasnt palying rekkless
[0:54:56] HellravenxD: Shushei
[0:54:57] Perseus6: Froggen
[0:54:59] DarthSven13: bjergsen
[0:55:00] ez_pop123: for faker it's just a matter of time
[0:55:00] Airfire: NA is definitely double
[0:55:00] Necrosity: Ocelote peepoGiggles
[0:55:02] amHumminG: diamondprox
[0:55:05] Tebrevet: Bjergsen for Na aswell

[0:55:46] Perseus6: Bro still playing
[0:55:59] KiccDacc: Can coaches or people that have contributed outside the game get honours, or is it just players?
[0:56:04] ka_gu_ra: inducting Doublelift and not inducting Faker only based on playing/not playing is kinda awkward in the end
[0:56:07] ez_pop123: forg1ven
[0:56:09] ez_pop123: lol
[0:56:11] AAAleksi: Froggen <3
[0:56:11] KiccDacc: Like Necrit or someone like that maybe
[0:56:12] NEXTYS: soaz?
[0:56:17] Silfel: froggenHappy
[0:56:25] killerwa1rus: Soaz is a good shout

[0:56:36] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[0:56:37] hellket__: Diamond, Froggen, Xpeke
[0:56:45] maxsteal9: @MedicCasts i missed, what exactly are u talking about?
[0:56:46] ez_pop123: it just depends how thay want to do this
[0:56:48] Raur: Jankos NODDERS
[0:56:53] dwakndwa: how will they deal with DL, when he keeps retiring and coming back. Would just come back after getting inducted.
[0:56:55] Rodnelas: how do you think rekkless will do in t1?
[0:56:55] Perseus6: I used to like Krepo as well
[0:56:56] Necrosity: Snoopeh strawb432Salute
[0:56:59] ez_pop123: g2 2019 should all be in there
[0:57:02] ez_pop123: and wunder
[0:57:05] Tebrevet: i cannot spell his name, so forgive me, but what about visichaci?
[0:57:06] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[0:57:07] novakellsa: his thresh lowlight lives in my brain
[0:57:11] markzuuu: YellowStar on thresh where he missed every skill xdd
[0:57:18] HeckMayster: toss up between xpeke and froggen imo considering how big season 2 was for froggen and season 3 was for xpeke/soaz
[0:57:28] thegingerphant0m: Diamondprox <3 i miss OG m5
[0:57:30] ez_pop123: wunder is the greatest eu top
[0:57:33] HeckMayster: but then again, diamond/alex ich
[0:57:40] elloydragon2: Caedrel 100% caedScuffed caedScuffed caedCancel
[0:57:40] hellket__: Jankos is instant HOF as he retires.. That's 8 years of top of the league jungling and meta changes + winning everything possible
[0:57:46] killerwa1rus: where do you count huni?
[0:57:49] Raur: Broxah POGGERS
[0:57:56] Perseus6: I think Bwipo prob is the best top
[0:58:03] Shengar: Vizicsacsi my GOAT
[0:58:08] aDiscombobulatedPuffin: what about Sneaky for LCS?
[0:58:08] ez_pop123: @Perseus6 no way

[0:59:01] ez_pop123: there's going to be alot of debate
[0:59:04] killerwa1rus: @Ka_gu_ra Pink Pony Club by Chappell Roan
[0:59:09] Sumiko88: do you think a team of retired eu players from back in the day could make a good run at the lec now?
[0:59:12] hellket__: I think the pioneers have to be the first to HOF and then recent retirement tbh
[0:59:13] Raur: madlife POGGERS
[0:59:14] ez_pop123: ofc
[0:59:16] HeckMayster: Yeah

[0:59:19] HeckMayster: undisputed
[0:59:27] Airfire: Did you see Ashley Kang's theory?
[0:59:27] Silfel: NODDERS
[0:59:31] Pamoth: KC fans might
[0:59:36] Tbuck92: surely Madlife for KR at some point pioneered enteraining support play
[0:59:43] ez_pop123: faker can win nothing for the next however many years and still be the first of the list lol
[0:59:44] dwakndwa: Could it be by impactful plays? Xpeke backdoor, Insec, Madlife hook, Faker zed play?
[0:59:53] SweTexx: i mean there is the rumor that faker didnt get ahri cuz he will get it from hol
[0:59:58] Perseus6: I think Ambition and Insec are also up there
[1:00:04] Rodnelas: broxah lee sin
[1:00:09] Pamoth: y0l0star

[1:01:17] Airfire: If you're doing it by Region is Core NA or KR?
[1:01:32] DeatroTV: Wunder monkaS

[1:01:52] ez_pop123: piglet for sure kr
[1:01:56] DarthSven13: Probably best to give it for "performance in the region"
[1:01:56] dwakndwa: It feels like this might cause a lot of controversy with who gets in
[1:02:16] ez_pop123: maybe 5 per year
[1:02:24] ez_pop123: lebron
[1:02:33] scratterboon: pop Bengi in there

[1:05:13] lumiusavalanche: @Hainell1 yes 100% rekkles, at least deserved after 2020 where he was the best adc in the tournament at worlds
[1:05:13] Necrosity: How would you count Bjergsen though. As he is basically EU but spend most of his time NA
[1:05:15] dwakndwa: They might do my number of international trophies maybe? Seems like a "safer" options

[1:58:19] ItsJustPoul: @KlaxIsDope idk if its nisqy whos shotcalling, we didnt see this type of playing from mad last year, but it does look like rider's tempo. I think shotcalls are all from nisqy and ISMA

[2:00:05] crispytain: SteerR
[2:00:42] bambieuw: in my soloq games that would hit the wall every time
[2:00:54] ItsJustPoul: I think their bot vision is mainly to protect Noah, cuz that kalista looks like the only win condition in FNC since oscar is getting turbogapped and Nisqy has been able to shut down Humanoid so well
[2:01:58] raivonrantara: yea hydra indeed looks a bit busted
[2:02:06] bambieuw: this renekton champion is just the most useless thing ever

[2:15:56] remixlol1: @Segalson yooo, big fan, didnt know you were into League
[2:15:56] killerwa1rus: ISMA seems to love to go HAM
[2:16:13] Lawltree66: If Nisqy had Flash to follow up the Magnet Storm with his pop blossom then that fight was GG.
[2:16:16] crispytain: but you can get 4 man with ult POGGER
[2:16:24] Segalson: @remixlol1 always have been o7
[2:16:34] AistisSlayer: after oscarinin lost top they had to stomp bot or gg
[2:17:23] tac0w0: i kinda feel that azir is a bit of a bait. you kinda have to be ahead of the curve for him to be usefull and you need a tad more frontline. and if you dont get good into game u lack damage
[2:18:19] tac0w0: ye ofc, i was just thinking bout later
[2:18:28] bambieuw: damn renekton got like 2k gold from getting turrets, hopefully he will be able to do smtn this game
[2:19:06] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.

[2:59:04] The_CompanyMan: solo que has been toxic since s2 - wont change sadly
[2:59:17] tac0w0: YEP
[2:59:20] jaggler: when durability update Sadge
[2:59:39] loaderj: @The_CompanyMan all online games are toxic, league is just the worst of it
[2:59:43] n0umenon: what's diana's build? :)
[2:59:51] HeckMayster: yeah someone on reddit said it best, the condition of 35% damage to proc isn't harsh enough of a condition
[2:59:59] The_CompanyMan: @loaderj oh for sure - its just been the worst of it for awhole
[3:00:02] Genewen: Malignance is disgusting on some champs
[3:00:07] aekrebs: @The_CompanyMan i dont like how they are trying to fix it, like less pings and such dont think being able to comunicate less will make it more toxic
[3:00:24] The_CompanyMan: ^
[3:00:32] lec_airport_speedrun: How do you fix it, though
[3:00:35] jaggler: super loki?
[3:00:37] aekrebs: @loaderj tbh league compared to rust isn't that bad
[3:00:37] tac0w0: loki can win this game

[3:00:45] HeckMayster: lowkey but the low is like subterrenean
[3:00:48] lec_airport_speedrun: But still playing
[3:01:04] loaderj: @lec_airport_speedrun actually ban people who int, you can 100% just /muteall and play
[3:01:15] lec_airport_speedrun: Then you ban ~90% of players
[3:01:19] loaderj: you cant play when your teamate runs it down
[3:01:21] lec_airport_speedrun: GG you killed your game
[3:01:23] jaggler: actually banning people would be a first step
[3:01:29] aekrebs: @lec_airport_speedrun honestly vc, i had some time away from league and played dota and it's insane how much vc does for a game plus people are more comfortable telling me to ornn e into trafik over text then voice

[3:30:52] jaggler: does revitalize also affect your own shield? It should, right?
[3:30:54] abdominusflex: damn thats nice then
[3:31:18] BenJaggers: @jaggler Shields & heals you give and receive i think
[3:31:33] LuisVentoso: is it really that bad if u guys swear on stream ?
[3:31:53] 13pipez: which item?
[3:32:06] jaggler: Ingenious Hunter for more Stormsurge procs Pog
[3:32:09] 13pipez: oh wow thats fucked up
[3:32:13] abdominusflex: you get fined if you swear on LEC?
[3:32:20] tac0w0: f-bomb when
[3:32:37] lec_airport_speedrun: Yo chat
[3:32:39] jaggler: i am sure there have been f-bombs on LEC KEKW
[3:32:46] lec_airport_speedrun: If anyone thought LEC this weekend was bad
[3:32:52] LuisVentoso: oh okay ty for the explanation !
[3:32:54] SafetySocks: the team gets fined if they swear, then the team fines the player, I thought?
[3:33:05] lec_airport_speedrun: LCK challengers is now on track for 1h+ of consecutive delays trying to start this series
[3:33:15] AbigailxCake: Context I'd paramount I think.
[3:33:16] Squallly: "[opposing team] were a fucking joke" = probably fineable?
[3:33:21] Davitzon: I kinda like it when something really hype happens and a caster drops an F-bomb
[3:33:22] AbigailxCake: Is*
[3:33:38] 13pipez: its so weird how every start of season is prone to delays
[3:33:39] BenJaggers: LCS had like a month delay last year no?
[3:33:41] lec_airport_speedrun: Tbf LCK chall was fine yesterday
[3:33:43] Silfel: @Davitzon it's genuine NODDERS
[3:33:48] jaggler: are the LEC delays related to the new studio? like some growing pains, getting used to the new place etc?
[3:33:49] 13pipez: do you change so much from summer to winter?
[3:33:50] abdominusflex: @Davitzon haha yea cuz it legit sounds genuine right
[3:34:04] Davitzon: @Silfel Ye exactly
[3:34:04] lec_airport_speedrun: It's just today they pulled out the LEC book of delays
[3:34:20] lec_airport_speedrun: @benjaggers you mean for the strike?
[3:34:24] bene_ges: EMENES got fined 15k$ poor guy
[3:34:26] BenJaggers: Yeah
[3:34:26] lec_airport_speedrun: That was only 2 weeks
[3:34:26] LuisVentoso: i feel like the scuffedness of the LEC its part of the charm
[3:34:31] jaggler: imagine a combination of LEC delays + FNC pauses. No E-Sports ever again
[3:34:46] 13pipez: good thing fnc doesnt play in lec then... wait
[3:34:52] Mirilendriel: @jaggler DW Rekkles took the FNC pauses with him apparently
[3:34:52] lec_airport_speedrun: (also LCK chall delay is fucking client issues not a player strike)
[3:34:53] jaggler: Aware
[3:35:23] TheK10S: @bene_ges Emenes thing was different though..  had to do with xenophobic comments
[3:35:31] jaggler: @Mirilendriel i totally forgot he went there KEKW
[3:35:31] 13pipez: POGGERS chair
[3:35:34] LuisVentoso: Hey chair ! How is that cheeks feeling?
[3:35:35] bene_ges: Ahh that is different
[3:35:41] AbigailxCake: Chair stream PrideUwu
[3:35:42] abdominusflex: i watch LCS sometimes and if there isnt captain flowers casting  it sux really hard compared to LEC. LEC feels a bit goofy, funny, prefesional all at the same time
[3:35:42] lec_airport_speedrun: BONK
[3:35:55] LuisVentoso: LETS GO CHAIR!
[3:36:02] lec_airport_speedrun: medicChair_SG
[3:36:09] TheK10S: AFK Warning!!
[3:36:12] lec_airport_speedrun: Report botlane inting
[3:36:13] Squallly: the one delay which seemed to get people's goat was that long one about the headset?  (there was a rumour that it was because it was a co-streamer's headset, and not anyone to do with main broadcast nor the game - i have no idea whether this is true or not)
[3:36:14] lec_airport_speedrun: Afk
[3:36:32] tac0w0: i see no difference to you playing
[3:36:54] Silfel: Surprised they took that fight
[3:37:03] Davitzon: Not popping potion in that fight is so crazy greedy lol
[3:37:24] LuisVentoso: both of u have great early and aftershock is great
[3:37:31] 13pipez: what does veigar actually build now
[3:37:37] Stefzz: are you french ? Default white flag ?
[3:37:50] 13pipez: ludens companion?
[3:37:59] lec_airport_speedrun: PogO

[3:38:57] Silfel: KEKWiggle
[3:39:05] Squallly: i have lasagne to blame for my re-discovered balsamic vinegar addiction (technically, it's the fault of the rocket salad, but eh :p)

[3:40:39] nekoniclaws: medics titles make some of us question reality...
[3:40:56] LuisVentoso: @nekoniclaws wait acutally do they fart~?
[3:41:02] lec_airport_speedrun: !fact
[3:41:03] StreamElements: Trees release excess methane produced by microbes in the plant. This is basically farting if you stretch the definition, which I did for it to be a cool fact.
[3:41:30] LuisVentoso: cooool
[3:41:34] nekoniclaws: oh my lord
[3:41:47] Squallly: What is the methane released through?  Leaves?  Bark?  Roots?
[3:42:00] lec_airport_speedrun: If I had to guess it's the leaves
[3:42:06] lec_airport_speedrun: Similar to respiration
[3:42:48] 13pipez: i would think its the leaves
[3:42:53] crancc: ever seen a tree hollow? thats probably what they are for
[3:43:01] Squallly: I'd guess so.  Biology is the one science I never paid much attention to.  (Says a lot, lmao :p)
[3:45:13] Nexusshade: Hello tehre MEdic I thope you have a great day of matches today ^^
[3:45:16] 13pipez: maybe you win if you ult the enemy carry Clueless
[3:45:39] 13pipez: lasagna PauseChamp
[3:45:51] crispytain: xdd
[3:45:59] crispytain: sage wisdom
[3:46:38] Nexusshade: this is quite early into the season. but what new item do you think is really strong right now as a tank support?
[3:47:12] TheK10S: Only 2 of the top 40 players on the ladder are ADC mains.
[3:48:32] kaverinn: back to earlier question - zeke on leo?
[3:48:44] 13pipez: @TheK10S draven/varus otps?
[3:49:06] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[3:49:11] Phoen1xChan: What do you think of the huge amount of banter happening at the moment in the LEC?
[3:49:16] Phoen1xChan: I love it personally
[3:49:33] 13pipez: im fully expecting a fist fight by the end of the split
[3:50:07] Phoen1xChan: @13pipez I hope it doesnt come to that, but it'd be exciting at the very least.
[3:50:35] TheK10S: LEC finals end with casters punching each other and blood everywhere? LEC definitely getting 18+ rating on twitch then.
[3:50:43] aekrebs: sled?
[3:50:44] 13pipez: not the casters
[3:50:47] 13pipez: some mdk/kc fans
[3:50:47] thisisloney: Sleigh  is bad, right?
[3:51:00] aekrebs: 90 ms
[3:51:01] Phoen1xChan: More like players, or even fans getting into a fight
[3:51:02] aekrebs: is broken
[3:51:07] 13pipez: which one is sleigh?
[3:51:43] Phoen1xChan: Xin Zhao is strong
[3:52:02] 13pipez: i dont think ive seen that
[3:52:13] raxxman: Slay Nautilus is so hard to deal with
[3:52:40] TheK10S: Take blue buff?
[3:52:46] roars59: GG♻️ Trees😂 or🌞Maokai😎🏃‍♂️😍 Fast✨️Stream🎀run 🏃‍♂️
[3:52:49] thisisloney: I did double Bloodsong yesterday with my AD. It's very balanced ;)
[3:53:06] raxxman: @thisisloney you are why we can't have nice things
[3:53:09] raxxman: :D
[3:53:13] 13pipez: unironically i think the best ezreal build uses bloodsong
[3:53:14] Sir_Acheron: too tanky
[3:53:35] thisisloney: @raxxman I am part of the problem, not the solution
[3:53:49] raxxman: @13pipez Ez abusing new item is a meme old as League
[3:53:59] 13pipez: thing is all the other sheen items are shit
[3:54:36] TheK10S: To press what on your keyboard?
[3:54:40] 13pipez: b
[3:54:43] raxxman: @13pipez New essence might be alright
[3:55:00] 13pipez: I think ive tried it past hotfix, it still feels way worse than before
[3:55:00] Phoen1xChan: @TheK10S or whatever your recall button is
[3:55:19] TheK10S: Cool
[3:55:19] 13pipez: in old season ezreal with ER dealt a shitton of damage, now it feels like nothing

[3:59:22] Squallly: Working hard (mostly)!
[3:59:43] Phoen1xChan: Mostly is better than not at all LUL
[4:01:10] 13pipez: they did take away a lot of its armor
[4:01:16] Phoen1xChan: I remember the days where support was lucky to complete one item LUL

[4:02:51] Silfel: Getting your adc killed danEvil nice
[4:02:58] Phoen1xChan: GigaChad Remix with the.... Assist?
[4:03:31] 13pipez: too preoccupied with trashtalk
[4:03:51] blueknight0007: what about cool beans?
[4:03:54] Phoen1xChan: Whats everyones favourite bean?
[4:03:54] TheK10S: HOW DARE YOU CALL BEANS STUPID
[4:04:06] Nexusshade: I'm a main adc/top and I don't like the duo dmg botlanes dangHands
[4:04:57] Squallly: @Phoen1xChan Green beans?  Preferably wrapped in bacon with a little dash of hollandaise :p
[4:05:32] Silfel: Kassasdin wtf rexWat
[4:05:35] Phoen1xChan: @Squallly sounds awesome!
[4:05:58] jaggler: why did medic do so little damage? D:
[4:06:16] Phoen1xChan: Medic getting carried by GigaChad Remix OneHAnd
[4:06:18] Phoen1xChan: OneHand

[4:10:54] 13pipez: is there no timer in obs?
[4:10:55] tac0w0: hands and brain
[4:10:56] almarianbliss: i thought you were playing renata cause she is in the splash art and i was so confused for a good 30 sec
[4:10:57] Phoen1xChan: idk, you're the pro streamer, arent you?
[4:11:01] SafetySocks: remix should be banned if it doesnt bop
[4:11:10] TheK10S: Since when are songs made in 2007 considered old? Or maybe i am just too old.
[4:11:38] thisisloney: @TheK10S that was 17 years ago
[4:11:51] Silfel: danAware
[4:12:19] TheK10S: When people say "old song" my brain connects it to 1970s and 1980s
[4:12:34] Silfel: Nothing existed before 1990
[4:12:40] Phoen1xChan: Is this the moment we bring back the old copypasta about people being faster in Hades, but dont record? LUL
[4:16:32] aekrebs: wait is rekkles not playing for t1 today
[4:16:39] Phoen1xChan: And Varus didnt get a kill, while Remix got 2
[4:17:01] Phoen1xChan: Thats unfortunate that one
[4:17:45] thisisloney: @aekrebs yeah, he's playing Senna right now I believe?
[4:18:10] aekrebs: @thisisloney omfg i'm blind i looked at adc and was like who tf is smash

[4:24:49] 13pipez: oh she went that healing mpen item first
[4:26:44] 13pipez: actual 1hp
[4:27:06] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[4:27:13] jaggler: i am so ARAM-brained, that i forgot that cannons don't reveal traps

[4:30:29] lec_airport_speedrun: (do you actually think he gets into LCK?)
[4:31:01] TheK10S: @lec_airport_speedrun No but he could make a lot of money in NA or something
[4:31:13] 13pipez: that talon left with more hp than he started with
[4:31:26] lec_airport_speedrun: Not everyone's motivation in life is getting as much money as they can
[4:31:47] 13pipez: NA isnt big moneybags region anymore
[4:31:57] lec_airport_speedrun: As demonstrated just now, guy can learn a bunch from LCK challengers
[4:32:15] lec_airport_speedrun: As well as getting to play with good players and against good players

[5:32:23] Sylvain269: Just saying
[5:33:08] Squallly: this seems somewhat ill advised
[5:33:19] 8kuji777: Fiora - R ready
[5:33:22] MortymorRobotron: @MedicCasts do other LEC casters cast other games too? I know you sometimes do Trackmania, Dash did Aoe2 just last week, so im wondering if its a common thing
[5:33:46] 8kuji777: bleach anyone
[5:34:40] MortymorRobotron: thanks
[5:34:43] iCuriosity: I guess Drakos kind of did?
[5:35:11] Squallly: @MortymorRobotron Vedius does incredible play-throughs when he gets hooked on a game (eg, daily 6-8 hr streams of FFXVI).  Tends to do it more in off-season tho.
[5:35:22] aekrebs: wait what
[5:35:32] aekrebs: f keys and you can see?
[5:35:36] this_is_daku: @MedicCasts found my problem regarding the lp gains. I played flex with a friend of mine and cause he's dia, we are being matched against emerald players... now I'm back to gaining 35 LP per win.
[5:35:38] MortymorRobotron: @Squallly ok thanks
[5:35:49] tac0w0: @aekrebs teammates
[5:36:00] iCuriosity: @iCuriosity wait my bad i meant Ender with Valorant
[5:36:19] Inniebin: Just Yas doing yas things
[5:37:08] iCuriosity: a n g e r y
[5:37:25] Rhimeth: wtf is that fist bump thing?
[5:37:34] Inniebin: I'm loving the Remix duos @MedicCasts ! Learning so much :D
[5:37:57] Squallly: FIST BUMP COMPLETED
[5:39:56] MortymorRobotron: you didnt miss, the wall dodged Kappa
[5:40:13] MortymorRobotron: wait i forgot i have golden kappa, i have to flex LUL
[5:40:16] MortymorRobotron: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[5:41:21] SafetySocks: Kappa
[5:41:25] SafetySocks: rip
[5:42:15] Glacial_Inferno_: holy unkillable
[5:42:31] Miramusa: That's gross
[5:42:42] mangofruitplays: wtf was that healing jesus christ
[5:42:44] Silfel: 11/1/5 awaree
[5:45:58] Kaionia: hey medic wishing you luck on your climbs!
[5:56:51] Squallly: is this gg?
[5:56:54] Squallly: doesn't look over yet
[5:57:26] Squallly: :(
[6:00:31] Squallly: WELL DONE CHAPPIES
[6:00:31] Inniebin: WOOO!
[6:00:44] Inniebin: Never surrender! right?! :D
[6:04:15] Squallly: Draft diff? :p
[6:10:12] Squallly: Gonna get a run in - spent too much of the last two days sitting at a desk.  Gl with the games and have a great evening! ^^
[6:14:33] Laragon: Singed still bugged or whatever had his win rate through the roof?
[6:15:42] aekrebs: @Laragon old items where just giga bad on him so his wr skyrocket with new ones
[6:16:09] NotBalsac: aatrox might be a little strong
[6:17:09] Laragon: Items are one thing, but he's at 56%, aatrox is next highest top at 52% win rate. That's a wildly massive gap
[6:18:35] rancert1: shouldn't your adc also have the support item? that's the meta
[6:19:07] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[6:19:16] Reap3r189: @Laragon it's just that he has actual items now instead of the monstrosity that was the mythic system
[6:28:10] lec_airport_speedrun: Hello, I have returned
[6:28:14] lec_airport_speedrun: Rekkles is a fraud
[6:28:27] popeturtle: wait what, how do trees fart?
[6:29:14] lec_airport_speedrun: !fact
[6:29:14] StreamElements: Trees release excess methane produced by microbes in the plant. This is basically farting if you stretch the definition, which I did for it to be a cool fact.
[6:33:22] killerwa1rus: Rekkles Sadge
[6:33:49] Rodnelas: yeah
[6:33:50] Phoen1xChan: Well.... I dont have a frozen shoulder, so I probably have a minor tear in a muscle or tendon
[6:34:00] Rodnelas: but he actuelly didnt play that bad tbh
[6:34:05] M4rkr: T1 Lost with a gold lead

[6:34:52] PooterPirker: 👋
[6:34:54] BunBunSquish: BRUV.
[6:34:55] Chron1cler: nah he was good
[6:34:58] the_whooligan: LUL
[6:35:05] lec_airport_speedrun: @chron1cler wrong
[6:35:08] the_whooligan: He was pretty good ngl
[6:35:09] Chron1cler: but t1 as a team is looking a bit dicey but makes sense they have been for the last 2 years LOL
[6:35:10] BunBunSquish: he was just ok
[6:35:25] BunBunSquish: trust chronicler over twitch chat? sus
[6:35:29] Chron1cler: T1 CL just hasnt been it
[6:35:29] lec_airport_speedrun: Yeah but chronicler is known to be t1 biased
[6:35:39] EdoBot: T1 lost to their own Neeko IMO
[6:35:42] BunBunSquish: biased casters
[6:35:44] Ztreeg: its more entertaining if we just agree that he ran it
[6:35:46] lec_airport_speedrun: Hello I am writing to express my absolute disgust at your T1 bias. Your bias is so disgustingly blatant such as when you started cheering for T1 like a lunatic in the damwon series. If you had any integrity about yourself you'd resign immediately and offer a public apology for your lack of professionalism. How dare you cheer for some noname failed org and team like T1 instead of DRX, the clearly superior team. From now on I'll be muting the stream if any of the current casters are casting.😡😡😡
[6:35:53] M4rkr: T1 lost to a blast cone
[6:35:53] shapedandshaded: poby my GoatEmotey
[6:35:55] BunBunSquish: lamp stop infecting other channels
[6:35:59] lec_airport_speedrun: This pasta doesn't exist if he isn't massively t1 biased
[6:36:09] No_Gods: Poby did spend more time walking around as a neeko minion rather than playing the game KEKW
[6:36:13] lec_airport_speedrun: @bunbunsquish you forget that I own this place
