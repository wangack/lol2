[1:01:52] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @chicoseta Secondary audio channel so the music doesn't get sent to the VOD. DMCA isn't doing live strikes yet, so as long as the recording doesn't have music people don't get hit. Yet.

[2:46:50] cameron416: @9fierce9 for singed?
[2:46:54] 9fierce9: ye
[2:47:28] GimmMeASammich: it was better last season when you spawned with support item stacks
[2:47:29] youareallsobeutyful: you're supposed to roam all the time with twitch
[2:47:57] cameron416: just proxying wave as only lik a singer or garen could. and means the other laner has to tank minions or farm under tower
[2:48:00] youareallsobeutyful: i think samira needs to much attention to be played with twitch
[2:48:00] MonaAmiella: as far as i know twitch support is annoy the enemy so they miss their farm and maybe kill them
[2:48:07] cameron416: i cannot type okay
[2:48:45] cameron416: @youareallsobeutyful theyve rlly not a good pair

[2:52:04] cameron416: i didnt realize you did in fact put on the hotpot playlist for ur hotpot
[2:52:20] MonaAmiella: catJAM
[2:52:30] 9fierce9: Do you use Jhin traps mostly as wards?
[2:53:29] youareallsobeutyful: i played with a twitch sup in low elo and he was in lane only to get kills like once every 2 mins
[2:53:50] cameron416: its bugged its so annoying
[2:54:11] MonaAmiella: how did milio kill twitch there ?
[2:54:42] cameron416: milio passive
[2:54:54] cameron416: when he uses an ability on allies their attacks gain burn dmg
[2:55:01] MonaAmiella: NOTED ah i see
[2:56:12] cameron416: they made it so when an ally applies the burn, it still counts as milio damage (in terms of triggering runes, support item gold, etc) but it's not supposed to steal kills
[2:57:01] hughjanus9001: lol
[2:57:02] hughjanus9001: 0 dmg
[2:57:19] rkwalton12: who is your favorite support to play with and why is it yuumi?

[2:58:47] cameron416: his passive also gives them bonus attack range but that wasnt directly relevant so i forgot
[2:59:19] iauja: its a debuff
[2:59:20] vDaishar: Looks up to see singed still doing his thing
[2:59:22] rkwalton12: but on a more serious note, what do you think about the touch of the void thing? im starting to feel like it its kind of oppressive if you get a lead with it

[3:29:55] caffeineul: when playing a riot game, there is never a win-win situation
[3:30:04] caffeineul: even if u win the rank, u lose your sanity gradually :)
[3:30:06] BluerBlack: I think the only way for game to nor affect the rank is when someone gets banned right?
[3:30:14] caffeineul: @BluerBlack i think so
[3:30:27] blazin_barbie: ü´°
[3:30:49] blazin_barbie: I wish it was a level up thing lmfao
[3:30:51] FrozenLavaReflector: Hilariously, the best use of thornmail is against shaco
[3:31:02] MonaAmiella: @BluerBlack iirc someone gets banned or it's a rematch due to afk in the first 10 minutes or so
[3:31:40] caffeineul: catJAM
[3:31:50] FrozenLavaReflector: Experimental hexplate on malphite thoughts?
[3:33:24] blazin_barbie: wait so surrendering doesn‚Äôt affecting rank going down?
[3:33:44] xP3ARL: wow, I just woke up and 5up is live LETSGO
[3:33:58] VengfulDark: is surrendering a loss?
[3:34:03] VengfulDark: @blazin_barbie
[3:34:16] MonaAmiella: surrendering does affect the rank because it's considered a loss
[3:34:20] psyfi6: this looks like a gold game lol
[3:34:40] blazin_barbie: ok thanks üíÄ I‚Äôm just a lil dumb this morning
[3:35:05] MonaAmiella: @blazin_barbie it's fine peepoPat
[3:35:09] VengfulDark: All good blaz
[3:35:19] Sol_Bebe: unfortunately I saw this result coming with how squish the team was
[3:35:28] hoshiNstar: Yikes
[3:35:38] NemoB90: how is that damage distribution even possible? :S
[3:35:59] BluerBlack: Tbf I would think its normal between top lane tanks with high regen
[3:36:12] xP3ARL: oh well foolishFire
[3:36:14] FrozenLavaReflector: Yeah welcome to aying tanks....its miserablr if no one can do damage
[3:36:38] VengfulDark: Just good at last hitting farm.
[3:36:41] VengfulDark: XD
[3:37:02] caffeineul: yeye
[3:37:09] BluerBlack: COPIUM
[3:37:09] xP3ARL: honestly yeah it prob would do more damage since it got 5 kills
[3:37:10] caffeineul: COPIUM
[3:37:21] balletbunny: only up from here :D
[3:37:25] NemoB90: sometimes it be like that
[3:38:12] MrFelon: Samira with 5 kills should be deleting 4/5s of that team instantly
[3:38:20] sharffffff: are you going dog?

[3:40:16] MariiWotterii: illaoi is tanky but not really a tank
[3:40:22] FrozenLavaReflector: Gwen woul love to play against that comp
[3:40:30] iauja: illaoi is fucked
[3:40:34] iauja: with how wide the lane is now
[3:40:36] iauja: too
[3:40:53] FrozenLavaReflector: And since they removed silvermere dawn.... it became 10 times worse
[3:41:16] FrozenLavaReflector: Cause ypur one counterplay was rushing qss.... but they took it away for bruisers
[3:41:23] BluerBlack: When I played this game fiora was mainly adc LUL
[3:41:27] MariiWotterii: good, i hate that champ
[3:41:30] BluerBlack: I guess things changed
[3:41:31] iauja: fuck it... we live

[3:53:18] BluerBlack: Member when Morde had totally op ult? Sadge
[3:54:01] RinaVX: Any hero that uses riftmaker seems really hard to deal with
[3:54:53] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[3:54:57] MonaAmiella: saveD she survived somehow
[3:55:21] ouranhshc: HUH
[3:55:52] BluerBlack: Its so weird to watch this game after so long. I member riots nerfing champs left and right for being too op and now with newer champs its fine LUL

[4:02:34] PeruPuffPepper: What rank are you
[4:02:45] MonaAmiella: !rank
[4:02:46] Fossabot: D4 (peak: Challenger) | https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/5up?hl=en_US (!ranks for other)
[4:03:08] PeruPuffPepper: Thank you
[4:03:33] Traveler4: wtf Yasuo? xD
[4:04:17] vDaishar: Niceeeee
[4:04:36] berrypudding08: It always baffles me, I've been watching you play LoL on and off for some time and I still don't get this game. It's like dark magic 5upSip
[4:05:20] vDaishar: So close
[4:05:22] SayFuzzyPickles: @berrypudding08 It took me quite a bit
[4:05:30] 9fierce9: Did your Ult get stuck in Brazil?
[4:05:34] Traveler4: if Nami wave hits them h@ber
[4:05:44] Traveler4: @berrypudding08 ahaha LoL is kinda like dark magic
[4:05:45] themegapikachu: 5up is becoming a toxic player
[4:05:55] CalvinDeuz: close but i think morde beats you when he has ult now
[4:06:19] RinaVX: im honestly about to run exhaust tp now
[4:06:40] NemoB90: looks like yasuo and draven are too busy flaming eachother to play :/ gonna be hard to win this
[4:06:43] 9fierce9: 5up is the most toxic player on league
[4:06:58] themegapikachu: time for toxic 5up arc
[4:07:39] hughjanus9001: that nilah dmg holy
[4:07:44] Traveler4: evelyn was afk from fight
[4:07:48] Traveler4: standing still in mid xD
[4:08:16] SayFuzzyPickles: ooftas
[4:08:23] themegapikachu: Sadge 5up cant 1v9
[4:08:34] CalvinDeuz: what is draven on lmaooo
[4:08:46] Traveler4: What Elo is this supposed to be?
[4:09:26] MonaAmiella: diamond
[4:09:59] 9fierce9: The restraint of a saint with the mouth of a sailor KEKW
[4:10:01] berrypudding08: So how's climbing through the ranks been going?
[4:10:31] NemoB90: chill 5up, not worth the energy typing. hes not gonna listen
[4:10:59] MonaAmiella: why are they even trying to 1v1 against the enemy tho it doesn't make sense
[4:11:02] beudestruidor: Losers queque
[4:11:09] Traveler4: Is it "Degen hours" time?
[4:11:09] themegapikachu: game said 5up needs to solo carry to masters 1v9
[4:11:34] Sol_Bebe: that was a game of all time
[4:11:34] TayTayPerseus: this looked more like one of my plat games macro wise
[4:11:38] Sol_Bebe: that‚Äôs for sure
[4:11:42] TayTayPerseus: is this really dia.
[4:11:48] NemoB90: drink some tea and de-stress. youre so tilted rn XD
[4:11:55] Othede: Voice coms would only increase the toxicity.
[4:12:08] ar_pachauri: That would be a toxic cesspit
[4:12:32] MonaAmiella: tbh yasou and draven were 1v1 feeding and the rest tried to survive the bs they created imo
[4:12:36] TayTayPerseus: valo has comms and it works
[4:12:37] Traveler4: @TayTayPerseus I dont know. It feels more like my rating which is silver bronze xD
[4:12:54] beudestruidor: Yeah just look at valo its less toxic there
[4:13:16] FrozenLavaReflector: Ah yes the classic fiora midlane
[4:14:17] iauja: voice in league would be perfectly fine
[4:14:20] iauja: its dumb that it doesnt exist
[4:14:28] themegapikachu: i think leeg tried doing voice coms but you to be in a party
[4:14:32] Kurly_ttv: Valorant is literally right there with voice coms
[4:14:33] iauja: dawngate
[4:14:35] themegapikachu: smite
[4:14:50] PoroKing: People remember those old COD lobies, but the reason that got so bad is because they were so lax on punishment
[4:15:05] Othede: Valo is a good example. I'm thinking the other shooters where it is bad, like COD and those types.
[4:15:12] th3cring3mast3r: Smite1 has it in ranked
[4:15:22] Cleophi: smite 2 won't need voice comms if they keep their callouts feature but add a "you are dogshit" callout option
[4:15:29] hughjanus9001: voice comms are much harder to moderate tho
[4:15:41] FrozenLavaReflector: Is that talon top or oriana support
[4:15:49] piveel: talon top?
[4:15:51] hughjanus9001: kids could get exposed to things they wouldn't want lol
[4:15:52] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[4:15:53] phoenoxious: phoenoxious subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[4:15:58] piveel: oh
[4:16:16] blazin_barbie: I think it‚Äôs the game comms is always the move I feel
[4:16:18] TayTayPerseus: i think voice chat gets easier to moderate nowadays with ml
[4:16:19] beudestruidor: Cs2 could get called toxic
[4:16:41] FrozenLavaReflector: Imagine, you two are the only dismond top players at this hour
[4:16:57] hughjanus9001: they probably could, but voice data gets really big really fast, it's probably a profit thing
[4:17:23] iauja: thats a good name
[4:17:27] NitroGames_FH: they can easily do what OW does and thats record voice comms to check for toxic or inappropriate behavior
[4:17:37] themegapikachu: have u been flagged yet 5up?
[4:18:22] LGFUADJJ: LOL
[4:18:24] balletbunny: Toxic
[4:18:27] hughjanus9001: @NitroGames_FH whats OW
[4:18:39] Othede: @NitroGames_FH That's a lot of data to manage. They already do that with game records right?
[4:18:50] berrypudding08: Lol 5up is becoming more toxic with age ü§£
[4:18:56] piveel: I literally just opened ow
[4:19:00] twtrok: see? they can not even detect toxicity in text chat if it was your only warning LUL
[4:19:13] TayTayPerseus: i mean the system they use to ban toxicity is just word recognition you can be really passive aggressive and will never get banned
[4:19:32] NemoB90: maybe the mods dont distinguish between toxicity and being rightfully angry
[4:19:34] balletbunny: üò≠
[4:19:35] berrypudding08: That's why it's ironic that you only get the warning now
[4:19:52] hughjanus9001: @twtrok 5up's not that toxic compared to others, he doesn't use curse words and such
[4:19:56] xthe_spacemanx: he will put you on an hour long discord call to flame you
[4:20:19] NemoB90: people like that dont really listen though, so saying anything to them is kinda pointless
[4:20:19] Jules_vdc: imagine being a streamer with a backseating chat 5upLUL
[4:20:25] schryliam: Joined in to learn some league :P
[4:20:32] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[4:20:37] Jules_vdc: so many people in chat are so wrong
[4:20:44] themegapikachu: om
[4:20:49] sagois: om
[4:21:23] hughjanus9001: honestly i'd really like to do that as a job
[4:21:26] themegapikachu: nothing like targeting you exbad teamtes the next game
[4:21:37] Jules_vdc: the teammate who thoguht they knew zillean mid better than you 5upLUL
[4:21:47] MonaAmiella: and now i fear we have a shitty hwei everytime i see a hwei on our team LUL
[4:22:01] hughjanus9001: like develop an algorithm that filters toxic people and use 5up games as supervised material xd
[4:22:06] berrypudding08: About merch. Amy plushies coming? 5upOOO
[4:22:11] nksato: Hellloooo
[4:22:20] FrozenLavaReflector: Not if doggos block every w
[4:23:03] hughjanus9001: cd after 3rd q is 7 sec
[4:23:09] hughjanus9001: should never use it early
[4:23:12] hughjanus9001: he bad
[4:23:17] NemoB90: is atrox especially good this patch?
[4:23:42] hughjanus9001: LUL
[4:23:57] ouranhshc: LUL
[4:24:13] ouranhshc: well
[4:24:30] FrozenLavaReflector: You went from hard winning to losing in one play
[4:25:28] sirenvibez: Um what's happening here what did i come back to? XD why was the first thing i heard after coming back from getting food "I'm going to kms now" or whatever..what an interesting sentence to return to with no context at all
[4:25:54] berrypudding08: Can I even realistically learn League by watching someone else play?
[4:26:08] FrozenLavaReflector: Is spear jaksho situational tank item the core you decided on tank naafiri?
[4:26:34] hughjanus9001: @berrypudding08 u could learn the objective and get some sense of what to do when, but mechanics and game sense are hard to learn by watching
[4:26:43] hughjanus9001: especially mechanics
[4:26:45] Cleophi: watching streamers is probably the best way to learn even if you're not trying to tbh
[4:27:05] Cleophi: maybe it's just me, but I just subconsciously end up copying their game sense
[4:27:06] piveel: I agree
[4:27:09] MonaAmiella: wb siren 5upWave and he accidentally flashed but didn't hit the aatrox with his q  so that might ive you a bit of context
[4:27:23] schryliam: I mostly need to get to understand the dynamic with items.
[4:27:36] NemoB90: arent you technically the bitch in this situation? being the dog and all...
[4:27:41] bluekaden: i think getting your friend to play with u is the best way to get into this game... cuz solo queuing in low lvl is painful..
[4:28:02] twilightsparkle8: you can try out the diffrent champs in costum games or practice vs ai
[4:28:11] sirenvibez: @monaamiella I see thank you (even tho i don't know this game I can at least understand a bit better by that explanation)
[4:28:43] sprink01: that q damage was crazy
[4:28:59] nksato: HypeCool
[4:28:59] sirenvibez: You'd think I'd learn something watching this almost every stream but nope
[4:29:32] sirenvibez: Cause I'm always too focused on chatting to learn stuffs.
[4:29:57] schryliam: Morde being stupid and blaming others, classic
[4:30:26] blazin_barbie: it really easy go get lost in league
[4:30:32] blazin_barbie: to*
[4:30:41] sirenvibez: League streams are my comfort streams because I can interact with 5up and the chatters. Makes for very comfy vibes love this community sirenv4Clydelove
[4:31:36] schryliam: @sirenvibez 2nd this
[4:31:44] TayTayPerseus: so short trades is the key until you can all in in this matchup?
[4:32:02] MonaAmiella: tbh siren same cause i understand only the bare minimum so i enjoy just sitting here comfy with chatters 5upComfy
[4:32:37] puppy_dog_person: Boosfer said he would play and stream among us with you tomorrow if you set up a game.
[4:32:48] veerveer_: I try to learn bc i used to love league but actually trying the game went disastrous ngl
[4:32:52] berrypudding08: From what I understand LoL is game in which strategy and knowledge about inner mechanics are very imposteant. What I'm not sure about is whether good reflexes and accuracy matter too.
[4:33:02] walkingtoneworleans: senzLove
[4:33:18] auraizen: when i understood nothing it was good background for studying but now i nderstand enough and its gen interesting to watch but now im so distracted from my work lol
[4:34:11] PoroKing: Morde not ulting is probably why hes seeing so many 3v1s
[4:34:27] schryliam: lol, I'm noob firsthand, but this morde i could have done better
[4:34:39] cari141: isn't morning lobby tomorrow?
[4:34:52] MonaAmiella: i feel like in a lot of these games today the jgl has been fed so much
[4:35:06] vDaishar: Pain
[4:35:13] xman1101: hey will you be playing cult of the lamb today since it‚Äôs the sex update
[4:35:35] sirenvibez: I'm sorry...what?
[4:35:39] xman1101: it‚Äôs a real update
[4:35:49] sirenvibez: That comment made me chole on my water XD
[4:35:59] xman1101: it also includes beer and guns
[4:36:01] sirenvibez: Caught me off gaurd XD
[4:36:09] ayeitskirby: 5up what time do you wake up cause omg its so early
[4:36:30] xman1101: he‚Äôs from
[4:36:31] schryliam: @berrypudding08 Yes yes and yes, and I recommend not joining up with your high level mates. I screwed up my matchmaking and have been against gamers far above my skill.
[4:36:36] vDaishar: Beer Guns and Sex, that's certainly an update
[4:36:38] xman1101: like the texas area if I rmeber
[4:36:43] FrozenLavaReflector: And if not league, letgal conpany... except for the one and a half weekly scheduled among us sessions, and minecraft events
[4:36:55] xman1101: but also he travels alot
[4:36:59] ayeitskirby: ohh
[4:37:06] xman1101: so he‚Äôs never contestant
[4:37:41] xman1101: like one time before the dubathon he was in Italy
[4:37:50] themegapikachu: 5 up needs to clone himself
[4:37:59] berrypudding08: @schryliam thanks. So basically it's about all the thing that I'm bad in xD
[4:38:00] vDaishar: That's the neat part! You don't LUL
[4:38:06] xman1101: buy hi time of day today I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs in Australia today
[4:38:25] hughjanus9001: lollll
[4:38:43] sirenvibez: What is this chatters assuming things
[4:38:58] xman1101: I‚Äôm good at geography so I can figure out timezones to  region
[4:39:10] sirenvibez: I hit enter too soon but um
[4:39:34] schryliam: @berrypudding08 Well if you have patience and self control, you can already win a lot by just taking things really slow. Better try with good calculated moves instead of panic clicks, even though you die it's the way to learn best.
[4:40:16] sirenvibez: @xman1101 no, he actually is just most the time in pst time when he's not traveling for stuff.
[4:40:38] sirenvibez: I think I typed that right but idk I am tired
[4:40:47] sirenvibez: I overslept and paid the price
[4:41:30] vDaishar: KEKW
[4:41:42] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[4:42:52] iauja: yesh

[4:49:10] schryliam: @berrypudding08 Practice tool is your friend. Try out champions, find one you like and suits you. Then just try and learn combo's on a dummy. Try a round against a bot, if you win it go for the real deal. Just, take, things, patiently. Don't let it tilt you and make you do hurried moves.

[5:02:41] pureiinsanity: @briweb11 it legit sounded like you wanted to end yourself because you live in a cold car
[5:02:44] pureiinsanity: thats how i read it

[5:46:38] FrozenLavaReflector: not really
[5:46:43] 9fierce9: I dont think so
[5:46:46] otiswilbur: i mean, the sylas game was similar to hades, no?
[5:46:49] iauja: it should have been
[5:46:49] FrozenLavaReflector: heard it was a good game
[5:46:53] pureiinsanity: a gamemode roguelike would be insane
[5:46:55] iauja: it had the potential to be one
[5:46:55] otiswilbur: combat wise at least

[5:49:02] NemoB90: why is the skeleton death sound so satisfying? :S
[5:49:10] pureiinsanity: but he's a bit spooked
[5:49:18] otiswilbur: i love ulting as twitch and then getting renata ulted peepoGiggles
[5:51:17] otiswilbur: ngl, you could just use halls of torment as map cover KEKW
