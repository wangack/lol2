[1:40:52] joaopob3: I am from brazil when I stayed in america everybody loved me
[1:40:53] Lappxas: I feel like that's mostly an American thing(the treating differently) IMO
[1:41:04] Fuselier: LMAOO
[1:41:07] joaopob3: loved them to btw
[1:41:36] 葉の小さい: no
[1:41:38] arcticstormsurge: i hate every one equally
[1:41:43] joaopob3: I believe racism is really bad in america
[1:41:47] Lappxas: LOL
[1:41:55] GrounZer00: I think part of it is people being excited to see something they perceive as different ya know? but being too uneducated to know how to handle it
[1:42:07] 葉の小さい: in Japan, I got asked all the time and then that was the end of that
[1:42:19] Fuselier: yeah it’s bad here but it’s crazy in other countries lmao
[1:42:37] joaopob3: I felt some people just didnt talk  to another people of different origins. some did
[1:42:49] Fuselier: yall got soccer/football games where a whole section is chanting racist shit lmao that would never go down at an NBA/Football game.
[1:43:03] Lappxas: even if it's not intentional it's just a bias that's why that question should be avoided, why does ethnicity matter
[1:43:07] Luis39091: i travelled a lot before covid and america is pretty racist
[1:43:08] Brydza3: think India is the most racist
[1:43:38] joaopob3: I remember a black guy in a gym that I used to say hi to him everyday, but he just talked to black people
[1:43:45] GrounZer00: "your kind" LMAO
[1:44:14] GrounZer00: I mean honestly the most racist people I've met were my other mexican friends lmao
[1:44:28] Lappxas: @Luis39091 I feel like they're too scared to be racist and come off more offensive with trying to be PC kind of like when they approach an asian and ask what type they are
[1:45:18] joaopob3: In america I remember seeing ads in chinese that I could not understand. Here this is prohibited. I believe it brings more distance between people
[1:45:30] MyndTrixx: hey at least you live closer to the league servers than California. So thats one good thing about Kansas lol
[1:45:45] xDaBossx: where is the league server?
[1:45:46] Lappxas: LOL
[1:46:01] Lappxas: real business comes from kansas
[1:46:20] xDaBossx: Kansas literally flatter than a pancake though
[1:47:07] GrounZer00: I was always kind of ashamed that I dont speak spanish, my dad just never taught me
[1:47:14] Fuselier: cost of living gotta be nice out in Kansas.

He is also great at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own BF. I love boys who are better at things than me so I can learn from them. God I want to date him.
