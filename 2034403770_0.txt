[0:38:12] goowied: ya rengar one shot is insane rn. idk why hec would be so weak with E
[0:38:15] darkstarr222: why is your map and team icons so big on your HUD xD
[0:38:21] Demonofbirds: FUNDAMENTOS
[0:38:22] xfreefer: it's because hec can overextend and not get punished when fed moreso i think
[0:38:23] josephthegoated: @thakiddm7 imo assasin hec was lowkey unhealthy due to duskblade, but still balanced on the fact that it is easy to counter with bruiser/tanks and is super lead reliant
[0:38:32] cheenis: @Tieiech theyre against hec malph. if they dont play teamfights correctly yea theyre gonna get fucked lmao. play the game smart

[0:38:47] WastedWaves: Hecarim can run around the map fast and then one shot compared to other assassins like rengar and talon, who can only go fast in the moment, yes they have mobility and can one shot but they cant go from bot to top in the span of a couple seconds and then one shot
[0:38:49] xenokatisback: hec was pretty balanced as far as hypercarries go

[0:39:23] thakiddm7: @josephthegoated I wudnt say that was balanced. that was the "skill expression" this 5head streamer is referring too. But that in itself is unbalanced. But i wud agree the more unhealthy thing was duskblade, which is why it was removed
[0:39:42] sspikkee: nvm i guess
[0:39:49] therocoso99: Unpopular take from a Rengar main myself. Rengar works better as a bruiser. But his numbers are for assassin.

A balancing point of any champ shud not be whether ur good on it, whether ur good on it shud upset the balanced champ. Thats how balance works. With ur takes u shud work at riot.
[0:45:29] sourcecodec: @danmansz yet kayn running in the terrain and talon hop, and eve perma invis is fine right?

He notices my muted Dantes stream I had playing in the background and moves to unmute it. I barely have time to scream before he turns the volume up to 3 percent. The sound waves vaporize him immediately, and I've been in a coma ever since.

[3:37:02] DrinkAndGlide: but nerfing jungle is nerfing the adc as well since you are forced to pick j4 every game and be a 3rd botlaner
[3:37:04] pho0oe3enix: it‘ll work out somehow
[3:37:04] wandyphel: adc unironically weakest role in the game since s10 and no one wants to buff it its so fking crazy
[3:37:06] ItsStiwn: ill make a irl patch and nerf his future generations by giving him radiation poisoning, so they get born with 5 balls and 6 fingers, and prostate cancer (ingame)
[3:37:09] AntoGnz: people want jungle nerfed but thats sucks. Laners can win with their brains turned off and clicking well while in jungle you actually NEED 1000X decisions. Jungle is more skilled than lanes gamewise. Then they keep nerfing jg????
