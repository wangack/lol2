[2:48:29] SpringSong: sadge
[2:48:36] 514484: wiki says it appleis spell effects
[2:48:55] SpringSong: @514484 no idea they said it applies 2 stack of conq every 4 sec or smthing like that
[2:49:17] SpringSong: if it applies conq it must be applies to liandry too
[2:49:39] 514484: spell effect is liandry so that should work
[2:49:42] 514484: would be funny
[2:49:46] 514484: new tankmo tech EZ
[2:49:48] sogymold: j4 top maybe
[2:49:50] razer_mon: j4
[2:50:03] poohgas: guess they didnt know either
[2:50:06] Aldurfus: no one top Smoge
[2:50:39] SpringSong: j4 sound more reasonable
[2:50:47] Breathe234: It was about another player in your team reporting someone
[2:50:52] SpringSong: xin probably
[2:51:17] 514484: unending despair Prayge

[3:00:48] 514484: interesting
[3:00:50] Breathe234: My win-rate has gone up this season with Teemo but I am Silver
[3:00:58] antroz92: PepeWhy meta chasers
[3:01:04] trombonator420: nah, if only liandries was just like the old one where it dealt 3% hp on champs who are slowed amd had 15 magic pen, teemo would probably feel a little better
[3:02:42] SpringSong: demolish kinda not worth atm
[3:03:10] Ctrlaltleet: yo ivan, i think that's skt1 marin
[3:03:13] Ctrlaltleet: won worlds w faker
[3:03:21] trombonator420: @ipav999 btw zwag is trying to otp teemo to challenger, maybe you can help him LUL ? cuz he just plays AP glass cannon like 100% of the time
[3:04:07] 514484: lichbane mo
[3:05:03] SpringSong: %8 ms from lich
[3:05:57] SpringSong: looks like he test items
[3:06:57] 514484: maybe he just saw the "tier list"
[3:07:46] antroz92: does he counters with only yordles? LUL
[3:07:50] 514484: random items PogBones looks like ipav build PogBones
[3:08:11] SpringSong: pta versus aatrox kekw
[3:08:31] pikapika_666_: suboptimal?
[3:13:12] trombonator420: is this the legendary lane only coin flip tenmo?
[3:16:38] jeromefrance: Look like an adc playstyle teemo with berserker/nashor everygame
[3:17:14] jeromefrance: For sur it shove the lane quick
[3:17:48] trombonator420: rift vs tanky champs?
[3:19:14] trombonator420: more of a bruiser fighter playstyle?
[3:20:11] trombonator420: too low range for a caster LUL
[3:20:30] 514484: unending despair EZ
[3:20:32] trombonator420: ye with the rune
[3:21:12] trombonator420: i mean if noone is super fed on the enemy team they cant really oneshot you with liandries and warmog
[3:21:52] WhiteCrowHQ: !build
[3:21:57] WhiteCrowHQ: :(
[3:23:17] trombonator420: @ipav999 btw zwag is trying to otp teemo to challenger, maybe you can help him LUL ? cuz he just plays AP glass cannon like 100% of the time, he even bans malph every game LUL
[3:24:05] trombonator420: Zwagmo
[3:24:11] trombonator420: he is streaming right now
[3:24:52] trombonator420: i guess he played it for like a day or two
[3:25:00] trombonator420: but i mostly see him top
[3:26:09] 514484: apparently the support item is bugged, you can get it and get no penalty to minion gold
[3:27:23] renoplay333: Guys, give me a boost, follow me on Twitter @reno_vieira
[3:27:32] trombonator420: go away
[3:27:48] trombonator420: MODS
[3:29:36] 514484: KEKW
[3:29:46] Exterminator_15: i don't like ap teemo
[3:29:51] iohah: MODS it has to be ap
[3:30:07] Exterminator_15: in this scenario
[3:30:28] trombonator420: i mean ROA is cheaper now LUL LUL LUL
[3:30:45] pikapika_666_: dorans blade at the beginning with ap?
[3:30:56] trombonator420: depends
[3:31:15] trombonator420: i pick it up to screw with guys taking mr runes
[3:31:39] 514484: hopefully there will be changes before next year KEKW
[3:31:47] Exterminator_15: PR every match
[3:31:56] Exterminator_15: for ms
[3:32:30] trombonator420: i mean malignance mostly gets like 1-2 procs from a shroom
[3:32:49] 514484: watch him build maligma second Kappa
[3:33:35] trombonator420: void staff also more AP? @ipav999
[3:33:55] trombonator420: or maybe not, lemme check
[3:34:08] Foonatic_: ipav is back PogChamp
[3:34:13] SpringSong: I dont like gathering storm it goes good after 20 min which is most of game last 21-28 around
[3:34:16] trombonator420: damn, void is still 80
[3:35:09] trombonator420: but oh well, at least now maybe if we dont need void we can finish with shadowflame?
[3:35:35] SpringSong: yea that is kinda very hard to get
[3:36:42] trombonator420: lessgo SA
[3:36:42] Exterminator_15: SA
[3:37:56] SpringSong: sa?
[3:38:05] trombonator420: @ipav999 btw what about ROA and seraphs, with liandries and stuff? i mean ROA is 2700 now
[3:38:21] SpringSong: @trombonator420 he dont like roa on teemo
[3:38:24] SpringSong: kinda useless
[3:39:07] SpringSong: shield is usefull too :o
[3:39:12] trombonator420: @ipav999 its more about getting both AP and HP tankiness
[3:39:20] trombonator420: + shield
[3:40:17] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[3:43:49] iohah: is ROA still paying for not very effective components to get a 'half' item that becomes item over time?
[3:45:55] trombonator420: @iohah i mean its 50AP, 350HP, 300mana for 2700 gold + a little bit of sustain
[3:46:00] xxpops: wits end
[3:46:08] trombonator420: but yeah, it stacks over 10 minutes
[3:46:53] trombonator420: second wind dShield probably solve malphite? @ipav999
[3:47:21] trombonator420: sheesh sad
[3:47:35] xxpops: grasp, tank item + wits end
[3:47:48] trombonator420: LUL
[3:47:58] Der_Angelord: LOL
[3:48:28] Exterminator_15: try dshield next time
[3:50:34] FuzeNuke: @ipav999 what do you think about people running BORK first item into all matchups on teemo
[3:51:03] FuzeNuke: im seeing people in my matches do it
[3:51:06] 514484: me and my dog do that
[3:51:10] FuzeNuke: randoms
[3:51:26] FuzeNuke: bork with that new terminus item
[3:51:56] FuzeNuke: like if the build is good
[3:53:10] xxpops: he's been testing AD teemo alot and it's behind the AP build
[3:53:30] Kaldarin2: how about q max against malphite?
[3:53:39] trombonator420: @ipav999 wits end on hit is the same, and botrk is 1% buffed
[3:53:54] trombonator420: but wits doesnt give 40AD anymore
[3:56:56] iohah: 🤔 what do tanky supports build now ?
[3:57:22] Tiberth: worth
[3:57:47] iohah: PauseCat
[3:58:13] trombonator420: taste+dShield
[4:01:58] trombonator420: well i checked ROA, seraphs, liandries, dCap,void and banshee is like 3.5k hp and 900 AP with scaling runes
[4:02:41] jeromefrance: @iohah i'have seen a lot that armor+health item leaving a bonus ms tray .
[4:02:48] iohah: NOTED true kassadin build
[4:04:32] kablooom: also shroom mana cost goes downward
[4:05:00] kablooom: malignance does soo much dmg with shroom timer. basically 300 dmg passive.
[4:05:09] iohah: mana would be good if you max w and go barefoot teeto build LUL
[4:05:45] trombonator420: @kablooom but if the guy just walks through the shrroom malignance only does like 1-2 ticks of damage
[4:06:07] kablooom: @trombonator420 true.. morgana teemo combo would be sick
[4:06:46] kablooom: Good to see you maxing Q again
[4:07:40] trombonator420: lessgo dCap
[4:07:53] Tiberth: amumu should have started by playing some arams
[4:08:04] trombonator420: oh wow double AP from cap LUL
[4:08:15] suppaahh: how does he have so much ap? wtf
[4:08:16] trombonator420: @ipav999 is that double AP from cap? LUL
[4:09:32] trombonator420: @ipav999 i mean you had 400 before the cap and 800 after
[4:09:48] 514484: ipav discovers AP FeelsGoodMan
[4:10:29] kablooom: im guess like 500+ ap?
[4:10:44] kablooom: AYYY PP
[4:11:00] xxpops: not a bad plan w/ Nashor
[4:12:08] xxpops: ya that's a full item
[4:12:25] Kalloool: 100ap = 3.5k gold maybe
[4:12:36] Kalloool: if u want to get it from items
[4:12:54] Kalloool: oooh hel no
[4:13:07] trombonator420: its like 1.6k gold

[4:48:41] trombonator420: @ipav999 i mean now goind for 2 defensive items (glass and banshee) doesnt sacrifice that much damage tbh
[4:48:54] kablooom: he doesnt care about ranked. we experimenting

[4:51:31] kablooom: gamba guess
[4:52:16] trombonator420: just take item CDR now LUL
[4:52:57] kablooom: generally i feel cdr means surviving team fights which could add up to more dmg.
[4:53:49] trombonator420: is it 6 autos?
[4:53:55] trombonator420: ah its 8
[4:53:59] kablooom: 30 min you seem to be about 3.5 items in.
