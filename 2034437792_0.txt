[0:43:50] Tharrick: @LordBlackstar we nonsense not at all, our knowledge (female) very large!
[0:43:54] clockworkcontrivance: the secondhand embarrassment "hurts"
[0:43:54] guuzen: I thought it was called that because one is in pain over how much money they spent on it PepeLaugh
[0:44:19] Tharrick: @AmakanZ45 kinda? it's the cringe from teenagers who think they're secretly wizards or superheroes or something

[0:45:51] AmakanZ45: what’s the feminine equivalent of aniki then?
[0:45:53] RvLeshrac: This sounds like the Japanese equivalent of a meat+3 waitress in the South calling you "darling" and "honey".
[0:46:06] clockworkcontrivance: will you spoil what you plan to cook with giri for us or is it a secret
[0:46:08] swordsmenjay: @bazeio probably neighbors
[0:46:15] Fronzel: My brother spent two years in Japan and tried to get jobs there. He told me of one interview where the person conducting dropped subtle hints to drop the formal type to more informal and casual. He picked up on them and responded with the sort of redneck version of dialect which really impressed them... sadly he didn't get the job.
[0:46:26] ynlokk: how about "a nee-sama"?

[0:50:08] Bazeio: aether131Sit you are telling me, jojo isnt a good way to learn japonese? dang it
[0:50:12] clockworkcontrivance: Duolingo also just fired a ton of translators and now just have people reviewing machine translation

[0:52:13] clockworkcontrivance: highly technical
[0:52:13] Jerzeem: ... there are people who can't diagram a sentence?
[0:52:16] ResidentLune: My bestest friend who went to Japan from the US is a 1-level on the kanji kentei. It still baffles me how he was able to do that. Apparently that level of kanji is just beyond the level of use for most folks there?
[0:52:16] Cigam_HFden: well english people speak about 3-6K words on the regular so learning that many in another language makes sense.

[0:52:48] Insayden: @Jerzeem what the hell does "diagram a sentence" mean?
[0:52:53] RvLeshrac: You internalize language rules, it's completely and totally unnecessary for 99% of speakers/readers to actually know any of the rules by name.
[0:53:06] Jaysky: sentence how do you grammars
[0:53:17] prosecutortourmaline: i remember learning sentence diagrams and then i immediately forgot how to do it

[1:01:04] xXKurokaDxDXx: my head hurt
[1:01:10] Scritoon: I see vswedNotes
[1:01:10] Kaji_Sensei: The homophones and homonyms are exactly why kanji are such a critical (and awesome) part of the language
[1:01:15] Moon_feral: It truly is a priviledge to be born into a country where you'll grow to have an intuitive understanding of your native language
[1:01:24] Kaji_Sensei: There's also pitch inflection in Japanese, however that varies by region quite a bit
[1:01:25] Skritty: without somewhere to practice it, I feel like it would all fall out of my brain pretty quickly if I learned it
[1:01:27] Layzay73: @taylorishere girldmHi glad to see you still have the wrench

[1:02:56] SirSaibot: Wait what
[1:02:56] div_angel: what in the elon musk is that???
[1:02:56] Kapuchu1: So Kirakira names are Frankenstein's Monster names?
[1:02:57] Dyoxx101: like light yagami and ichigo kurosoke
[1:02:58] HeerReetveter: Simmilar to 一 being read like ninomae? or is that different?
[1:02:58] NIKOvbn: LUL
[1:02:59] LordBlackstar: So that thing that Elon Musk did
[1:03:00] ToBeArtistic: "It's only kirakira namae if it's from the kirakira region of Japan. Otherwise it's just sparkling name" /j

[1:03:02] MrBluespirit: Been busy with studies for so long, haven't seen this model before. Looks great!

[1:03:04] Xardnas: i hate it here
[1:03:09] ynlokk: so... "custome Kanji"
[1:03:11] SojiVT: There was a big problem with this. A girl was named 愛li, but her parents demanded it be pronounced "Lovely"
[1:03:16] ynlokk: *custom
[1:03:16] swordsmenjay: that’s pretty interesting
[1:03:18] SirSaibot: One more time for my slow brain please girldmPanicF

[1:03:36] electrode13_5: like that person with a kid called kaitlyn, spelled as kVIIIlin, cos of latin eight?
[1:03:42] Jrunnah: The irony of the title being "CrossCode", as we're CrossCoding language
[1:03:43] zednanreh72: brain melting
[1:03:44] LarkyLuna: how do starbucks work?
[1:03:45] Jerzeem: Like Prince!

[1:03:56] DancingCorpse: how do you have enough room in your brain for all of this!?
[1:03:58] Izel_Aca: it’s like Kaylee but spelt Kayleigh
[1:03:59] Kapuchu1: Suddenly I understand a little why some anime have "My name is X, and spelled like Y."
[1:04:07] taylorishere: Chloe = Klowee
[1:04:09] RvLeshrac: Knew a girl called Katy once whose initials were K.D. and this was very much done by her parents on purpose.
[1:04:10] Jerzeem: or rather, they're ALL like Prince
[1:04:10] clockworkcontrivance: here's an etymology question. is namae a twist on "name" as a loan word, or is it pure coincidence that they're so similar
[1:04:17] ErickGaToRR: StarbuckTsu
[1:04:22] taylorishere: A-A-RON
[1:04:22] RvLeshrac: This sounds like the same kind of deal.
[1:04:24] Moon_feral: Interesting. At least you can really make peoples names unique
[1:04:42] NibhShurah: Curious question, how would one spell name with Ys in it
[1:04:43] CasualKJ: got it
[1:04:50] SirSaibot: 麗月 girldmBongocat or without the first one?
[1:04:53] Jrunnah: @taylorishere A Aaron Aaronson

[1:05:03] AremZim: Y
[1:05:14] mircea91: but y tho
[1:05:29] LordBlackstar: I guess Yu is dead, RIP
[1:05:29] ynlokk: its the Ls thats replaced with Rs
[1:05:29] Skritty: naming a kid forgotten characters seems like the way to go
[1:05:30] Jannimeister: can they just off a charater like that?
[1:05:33] Lazy_Tomm: Nice music.
[1:05:38] clockworkcontrivance: and if you're in Australia they call it Stabba Kappa
[1:05:38] CasualKJ: no joke, kinda wild lesson. thanks
[1:05:55] Sir_Khris: su-ta-bax-oo :p
[1:05:57] ErickGaToRR: Ohhhh lol
[1:05:57] Insayden: so is there a standard way to translate say English names to Japanese? Or could you pick and choose a sparkly version of your English name in Japanese if you know what you're doing?
[1:05:59] Jrunnah: @Jannimeister I'm guessing its vernacular?
[1:06:04] SirSaibot: Sunglasses are also fun

[1:06:27] NibhShurah: not that Y. Not Yeti Y... more of a... yyyyh, Y
[1:06:29] div_angel: god of fish?
[1:06:33] TheFluffyMenace: This channel is better than Rosetta Stone
[1:06:36] FiftyRings: That's like saying my name is Daniel, but spelling it in phonetics ˈdænjəl for fun
[1:06:36] Jerzeem: we've dumped letters in english, so sure
[1:06:49] swaticusgaming: my brain hurt
[1:06:55] DancingCorpse: I find it funny as heck you have been in the Crosscode category for all of this LUL
[1:06:55] taylorishere: Also, my favorite - onomonopeia words! Gorororororo

[1:07:07] k2kiri: girldmNoted
[1:07:09] Kapuchu1: interesting
[1:07:16] AmakanZ45: Double letters in romanji means that the sound is lengthened, ye?
[1:07:17] Lazy_Tomm: I tried learning Japanese via Duolingo. I should try picking it up again.
[1:07:18] Aigar_Vulo: @swaticusgaming Seriously. I'm amazed my nose hasn't started bleeding LUL
[1:07:18] swordsmenjay: If its for the main characters development, of course they can knock off a character
[1:07:20] denshinokage: also small ya yo yu at the end

[1:07:27] aSpaceLion89: girldmNoted

[1:07:38] Skritty: girldmNyan
[1:07:38] Kapuchu1: Now I know why it's shortened! I always wondered why subs said "Akihabara" and the character said "Akiba"

[1:08:30] Baenarai: にゃ (nya) vs にや (niya) for visualization

[1:08:38] barrettsmithbb: @bazeio that sounds fun
[1:08:39] Tharrick: richard to a shortened name that is almost certainly filtered

[1:10:10] ynlokk: same rules for their word chain game
[1:10:14] wundertuete_rb: Isnt there a anime called nyankoi?
[1:10:32] LordBlackstar: Japanese is a Syllable based language, unlike, say, English.
[1:10:33] Kapuchu1: My name is only 3 letters, and is so difficult to use in other languages
[1:10:37] GryphonSDK: Your brain knows more than you know!
[1:10:40] DancingCorpse: dm has a big brain to hold all of this.
[1:10:41] Halfcaf: Doesn't Japanese not have 'L' or 'r' but something thats about halfway between those?
[1:10:45] hamzahkhan753804: I've always wondered, how would my name be pronounced in Japanese? People have always gotten mine wrong in some way through my life, so Idk how it would look to someone who speaks Japanese?
[1:10:47] igotheals: I get the feeling you've forgotten more japanese than I have learned English lol

[1:10:57] Cigam_HFden: when I was making languages I would use "ng" as a vowel with my other a e i o u combos, is there something like that?
[1:11:09] bitamarbilg: ma r b i l = marble dope
[1:11:15] FiftyRings: so like Tiffany would be weird translated

[1:11:30] kalizarin: @FiftyRings that would be like ti fa ni
[1:11:37] clockworkcontrivance: showing up for reservations when I was in Japan was so funny, because my last name went from 3 syllables to 5 syllables with japanese pronunciation, and I had to say it like that so they could understand how it was spelled
[1:11:45] NibhShurah: yeah, so as Im explaining... it's not Why Y, its y Y. not enlgish pronounciation

[1:17:57] DedlokPM: @DancingCorpse "excuse me!"
[1:17:57] tei_ji: Not only are sentence structures different, you often don't even finish your sentence with Japanese like you do in English.

[1:20:12] Crows_Dome: @gumm1wyrm It is indeed

[1:29:35] TheFluffyMenace: Tales games are so vanilla
[1:29:36] vic_weave: of the Tales games, Vesperia is pretty good
[1:29:36] juicepunchplays: Likable?
[1:29:38] LeotoBrilloVT: He's a gruff vigilante voiced by Troy Baker.

[1:29:49] bluedude153: I mean DM could play it but it sure wouldnt go how you would want

[1:30:32] Dornarr: Aura told Kiara that you like JPRGs girldmLUL
[1:30:34] Avalathela: Turn based insn't hte problem, it's that JRPG's typically have 0 respect for your time
[1:30:35] Sir_Khris: turn-based games != good time. good to know so card games and Armello girldmNoted
[1:30:45] Bazeio: @AmakanZ45 but its a league game KEKW

[1:35:27] Gold_Joker: Oh this game is good. Nice.
[1:35:29] Moon_feral: I have a feeling we'll be talking about ballz a lot along this story

[1:36:18] Tharrick: @hobbszilla they *are* virtual after all
[1:36:18] Fiddox: This game is entirely practical with a mouse and keyboard.
[1:36:20] colnick101: maybe mouse and keyboard would be better then?
[1:36:24] Sir_Khris: SIMPLE GEOMETRY

[1:36:41] jasonrevall: psychic pool
[1:36:42] CaptainVett: Yeah its a trade off with this game. If you play with a controller you better movement control but with mouse/keyboard you get better throwing accuracy
[1:36:43] Steam_Gray: AHA- we have discovered a weakness- GEOMETERY! Also, probably a bunch of trees

[1:39:18] gumm1wyrm: "Ball throwing" is such an archaic term... its called spheromancy.
[1:39:28] Crows_Dome: I will say this, the game tends to be a puzzle game more than an RPG game at times
[1:39:58] Smurfykins: even fighting is its own degree of combat

[2:40:22] VenciGameDev: you need a plush to gain one backseat ticket
[2:40:23] NibhShurah: i prefer the smack things very hard types of puzzles

[2:40:44] lordofthenines: what does the "manx" tag mean, y'all?

[3:40:26] Skritty: girldmWut
[3:40:28] hamzahkhan753804: Yeah, there's nothing there DM. Think this is a bit about newbies getting lost in the center, and him not noticing the one way entrance above

[3:52:15] RvLeshrac: TFW you open your chicken and it tries to sell you an Opti-Grab.

[3:53:57] NewBrush: true
[3:54:10] RvLeshrac: I'm honestly not really sure why people thought you'd enjoy it, it's very A-JRPG, like an SoM game.
[3:54:22] maniifestantes: he's done dm the girl
[3:54:24] Aethersen: BYEE girldmCheer
[3:54:29] Aethersen: wait aether131SlowBlink
[3:54:39] RvLeshrac: The gameplay itself *is* good, but there's a lot of JRPG-style exposition and forced stalling.

[3:55:59] Sir_Khris: why is ciao pronounced ciao. I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
[3:56:09] sammeh712: Hi-sandwich. Not potion. Sandwich. Interesting choice for a healing item.
[3:56:32] Avalathela: game starts painfully slow if I remember correctly, it does pick up eventually
[3:56:37] RvLeshrac: It does pick up a bit past the cookie-cutter intro.
[3:56:38] Sephim: it is very JRPG in those aspects
[3:57:03] uhKAWABUNGA: its as slow as you make it, how much side stuff you choose to do
[3:57:12] Rynako_: Ooo this game looks fun
[3:57:18] DancingCorpse: but how else will they make sure you see the thing!?
[3:57:20] B_as_in_Bacon: yeah, like several hours of wall-of-text tutorial is not the one.

[3:57:24] Rynako_: EWWOO
[3:57:27] RvLeshrac: Some day the folks who do JRPG-style games will learn to not use 40 textboxes with 4500 words when 1 textbox with 5 words will do.

[3:58:23] teflora: radica20Cheese radica20Cheese radica20Cheese radica20Cheese

[3:58:41] LarkyLuna: @teflora hsdyshydyhusd
[3:58:46] maniifestantes: the heights?
[3:59:13] Seekerone8: This game taxed my brain then made me feel dumb when i  figured out the easy solutions
[3:59:14] electrode13_5: @Rynako_ one of my top faves, would recommend if you like the genre
[3:59:18] suJayhh: is the character art on the right customizable?
[3:59:19] Rynako_: Ohhhhh
[3:59:23] Aeonknight_87: it carries across zones at least
[3:59:26] Rynako_: @electrode13_5 Nodders
[3:59:28] Aeonknight_87: so you can just run to next screen
[3:59:29] uhKAWABUNGA: the rank carries thru maps, so you can run to next map for more enemies
[3:59:29] teflora: @larkyluna hiyaa thank you for letting me know!
[3:59:36] swordsmenjay: it’s incredible! definitely recommend girldmThumbsup
[3:59:44] VoidedJade: Note that reaching S rank massively drops respawn timers, you can also run to a different screen to keep rank going
[3:59:45] crazytim45: Yep. Fortunately, the drop bonus isn't mandatory, it just helps things go faster when grinding
[3:59:47] sammeh712: Yeah, that sounds like a lot of work just to keep your rank...
[3:59:53] HolyMadman: @suJayhh there are skins that change it, but equipment doesn't alter it if that's what you're asking
[4:00:19] big_wah: this game has a pretty hefty amount of side quests. don't feel obligated to do em all
[4:00:28] Evilrayman1986: Yes quest yes quest givers giving you quest for zones you've never even been to
[4:00:43] hamzahkhan753804: Oh god she's dead

[4:01:16] Magal253: she do not have how Spend SP?
[4:01:18] gumm1wyrm: Combat combos are mainly for after youve explored an area anyway, the game doesnt require you to grind or anything
[4:01:19] uhKAWABUNGA: and that freezes time s oyou can do it in combat
[4:01:25] electrode13_5: @Rynako_ no worries sasuke, you were always my favourite ninja
[4:01:42] KanpekiSaru: lol
[4:01:44] swordsmenjay: gotta eat a magic sandwich ta heal
[4:01:45] VoidedJade: You can quick menu in combat, it freezes time too
[4:02:09] RvLeshrac: It's true, combat rank just makes grinding faster.
[4:02:10] gumm1wyrm: I didnt start doing it till post game lol
[4:02:14] Rynako_: @electrode13_5 LMAOOO sasuke is flushed, tyyy
[4:02:22] uhKAWABUNGA: its nice, not necessary. S rank isnt like super easy to get but helps with xp

[4:02:43] NewBrush: tfw i didnt know about the toggle feature
[4:02:45] Sir_Khris: EVERY gamer's favorite pasttime. GRINDING!!!
[4:02:46] UrsoT2: The quests usually helps you to get the hang of the combat, once you know how the enemies work and how to maintain rank it stops being an annoyance
[4:02:51] Sir_Khris: passtime* 󠀀
[4:02:51] RvLeshrac: Every PC game should let you alter the button prompts for the three standard controller types.
[4:03:02] DancingCorpse: Grinding, every WoW players favorite past time kabhaaSmug
[4:03:12] teflora: Tbf the game needs almost no grinding
[4:03:16] VoidedJade: Honestly, crosscode makes grinding battles very fun because of the rank mechanic.
[4:03:17] RvLeshrac: "Grinding" is maybe a strong word to use, I don't remember ever actually needing to farm anything.
[4:03:29] Sir_Khris: is there grinding in WoW? its been so long since I last played classic WoW girldmDead
[4:03:32] LarkyLuna: me neither
[4:03:37] isanh: ugh, mmo quests... "you are the hero who will save the world. kill 20 boars for us!" girldmCringe
[4:03:45] RvLeshrac: It's like the difference between having to fight 10 enemies instead of 15 or whatever.
[4:03:53] cruisec0ntrol: @Sir_Khris the grind has become less monotonous
[4:03:54] beautifulorigin: Right trigger
[4:04:02] cruisec0ntrol: but yes
[4:04:05] beautifulorigin: Yes
[4:04:09] UrsoT2: Right trigger
[4:04:09] Seekerone8: @RvLeshrac yeah i remember only a few rarer items that needed some time to drop.
[4:04:12] Sir_Khris: its been so long
[4:04:32] RvLeshrac: @cruisec0ntrol It hasn't, people have just Stockholm'd themselves, across all MMOs, into thinking the hundreds of hours "aren't grinding" because they aren't thousands of hours.
[4:04:36] cruisec0ntrol: @Sir_Khris Grinding is jusdt a normal chore on your favorite mmo
[4:04:37] Ryok: @Sir_Khris it depends on what you consider grinding... killing 5000 mobs to level up once? no... killing a boss 500 times for a 0.1% mount drop? hell yes
[4:04:52] Sir_Khris: D:
[4:04:54] Kamakazie: Kamakazie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! 24 months!  Woah!
[4:04:55] StreamElements: Kamakazie just subscribed for 24 months in a row girldmBounce
[4:04:59] Sir_Khris: you ain't wrong @Ryok
[4:05:06] RvLeshrac: @Ryok That's all grinding. Killing something more than like a half-dozen times is grinding.
[4:05:08] GryphonSDK: or emPHAsis girldmSmugheh
[4:05:25] Sir_Khris: Maplestory IS the grind
[4:05:32] hamzahkhan753804: Not sure if it's been mentioned or not yet, but I do believe the combat rank also improves item drops from plants, so if you need plant stuff for a quest, the ranking can help with that too
[4:05:42] cruisec0ntrol: @Ryok Eh I tend to always be in the know where to farm my items
[4:05:44] VoidedJade: It does not
[4:05:44] Ryok: @RvLeshrac but it's not like you HAVE to grind for a mount drop if you don't want to PrideShrug
[4:05:55] cruisec0ntrol: @Ryok that too
[4:06:06] beautifulorigin: Is there a visibility feature that might help with seeing elevation?
[4:06:25] Aeonknight_87: if you want to extend your melee combo you can use your Dodge to reset the combo and chain it
[4:06:31] LarkyLuna: there's a bit of a difference of what mmo flavoring of the story is and what the actual game asks of you. this game felt very lenient with that is actually required
[4:06:34] Sir_Khris: now question @girl_dm_ : did this bribe required you to play this game to completion or just once on stream?
[4:06:36] Seekerone8: there are a a number of areas that are locked behind story progress. don't worry too much if you can't access some areas
[4:06:41] VoidedJade: Combat rank does NOT affect plant drops, that's only with specific equipment
[4:06:51] UrsoT2: The drops from plants dont increase with combat rank iirc, not sure but i dont recall
[4:06:56] gumm1wyrm: But drops are only important if you care about loot
[4:07:10] hamzahkhan753804: Oh sorry, it's been a very long time since I last played, sorry about that
[4:07:12] KanpekiSaru: people be stupid dm you know it
[4:07:18] NewBrush: im learning so much wow
[4:07:18] Ryok: my first MMO was ragnarok online almost 20 years ago... which makes all grinds in ANY other game seem like a joke
[4:07:20] uhKAWABUNGA: ah, bummer..
[4:07:22] Sir_Khris: KK girldmThumbsup
[4:07:27] dirk_trash: Grasshead!
[4:07:29] Ryok: maybe it was 20 years ago by now merodyHmm

[4:07:58] Evilrayman1986: Back seat players liening to you
[4:08:00] cruisec0ntrol: That is why I always look in to the theorycrafter forums to understand
[4:08:13] Ksiraan: YIPPEE
[4:08:20] goldencecelia: uhm
[4:08:21] RvLeshrac: For the people who haven't palyed in a while, at least caveat your answers with "I haven't played in a while, but from what I remember..."
[4:08:31] dirk_trash: The duel is mad fun
[4:08:49] goldencecelia: uhhh
[4:08:58] VoidedJade: For the slicing thing, it can interrupt enemy attacks but if an enemy is charging/shielding/doing certain actions they will not care
[4:09:03] goldencecelia: what just happened?
[4:09:07] Sir_Khris: wait... is that not how you spell dairy air as well D: ?

[4:09:28] electrode13_5: aye, i love the game but i wasnt expecting it to be mind blowing for you
[4:09:29] Kamakazie: You don't like mashing a button to kill porcupines?
[4:09:33] DancingCorpse: remember, it's okay for the streamer to not like the game.
[4:09:37] KanpekiSaru: T.T
[4:09:37] crazytim45: Is it at least better than Persona?
[4:09:39] Evilrayman1986: Not your taste
[4:09:44] mattmk_ii: girldmSnack soo far not for DM
[4:09:54] hexosm: @Kamakazie There are a slew of special moves.
[4:09:55] goldencecelia: it seems like a game that takes a while to get used to
[4:10:00] Sir_Khris: needs more challenge
[4:10:06] StreamElements: having fun watching? 🎬 clipping is appreciated on funny and interesting moments! 🎬 dont forget to title it!!
[4:10:07] AMB_Bakery: i adore this game but it is definitely corny
[4:10:17] Seekerone8: honestly this is making me want to play it again
[4:10:20] LarkyLuna: they are working on a new game and it's looking so cute extraCozy
[4:10:26] hexosm: @Sir_Khris Oh, it gets a lot harder later.
[4:10:27] RvLeshrac: This is why I think genres are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, and why I hate the conversations poo-pooing the idea of genres.
[4:10:32] Sir_Khris: o.o
[4:10:34] cruisec0ntrol: Just missing a certain element perhaps?
[4:10:35] electrode13_5: real big puzzle focus later on as well, which can turn people off it
[4:10:41] uhKAWABUNGA: i feel like if people can get thru elden ring, they can get thru this. like theres a lot to learn but once you get it its great
[4:10:42] HolyMadman: if you're not a fan of how it does puzzles you honestly might drop it when you get to the first dungeon, this game's VERY puzzle-heavy even for a Zelda-type game
[4:10:52] NewBrush: it makes sense considering how it will be later.
[4:10:57] B_as_in_Bacon: I'm actually happy you are playing through this because I have it wishlisted, but I think I'd end up getting turned off on some things
[4:11:13] Sir_Khris: tell?
[4:11:18] Hoschpi: Hoschpi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[4:11:18] StreamElements: Hoschpi just subscribed for 6 months in a row girldmBounce
[4:11:19] B_as_in_Bacon: so much text to get to game
[4:11:20] VoidedJade: So, it's hard to explain without spoiling.
[4:11:22] Avalathela: WALL OF TEXT
[4:11:25] RvLeshrac: @uhKAWABUNGA That seems to assume that the problem is difficulty or whatever, when the problem is just how the genre goes about things.
[4:11:30] VoidedJade: But most of the "tell" is a facade
[4:11:30] Sir_Khris: oh
[4:11:30] That_juanGuy: Lots of handholding?
[4:11:30] Draunix5: In the sense that it doesn't let you figure it out yourself?
[4:11:31] SpartanRyno: Barrage of words.  Nothing else
[4:11:31] Bazeio: i miss someone with Akechi personallity on Lies of P
[4:11:34] Sephim: it is a lot of tell
[4:11:37] UrsoT2: I'd say it takes a lot of time, its really about learning about the enemies and how to counter their actions
[4:11:42] HolyMadman: it's very front-loaded for text, yeah
[4:11:50] Sir_Khris: like look and learn. not tell and comprehend. right?
[4:11:53] UrsoT2: Sorry, i meant it DOESN'T take a lot of time
[4:11:54] hexosm: I think part of the issue is they're 'emulating' an MMO where text and word salad is par for the course.
[4:11:55] Melae: So you would like to play more J-RPGs? girldmTehepero
[4:11:58] LordBlackstar: Tell as opposed to show. Generally a "Tell, don't Show" approach is considered bad.
[4:12:00] crazytim45: I believe the text wall is mostly just getting in, I think it gets better
[4:12:26] Tsukinokaton: Old rpgs and jrpgs have a lot of text girldmWhyF
[4:12:38] VoidedJade: It's weird cause the game never does this again after the first arc. It can even go to having the opposite problem of not telling enough.
[4:12:49] uhKAWABUNGA: ^
[4:12:53] Evilrayman1986: Word salad alot
[4:12:56] RvLeshrac: @hexosm There are good and bad ways to do that, like having a character talking-head at you *while you're moving and doing stuff* is good and funny. Stopping you dead in your tracks for a 40 page exposition is not.
[4:13:00] Sir_Khris: maybe this is why I don't care for RPGs because there is too much text
[4:13:10] B_as_in_Bacon: yeah, dead cells is great, it just kind of dumps you in and slowly introduces new stuff
[4:13:11] dirk_trash: Did you ever beat 5BC on Deadcells?
[4:13:11] bluedude153: Its text for text sake. Reminds me of Golden Sun where you have to read a small book every cutscene
[4:13:13] Magicicada: dead cells was nice how it did a cutscene the first fight then never again on replays
[4:13:17] kalas_13: then you NEVER  try to play a trails/ kiseki title
[4:13:18] NewBrush: honestly, it might screw with you when you want the opposite
[4:13:28] deedjay__tr: i ate a ant today cuz yes
[4:13:38] Tsukinokaton: Hmm Ys from falcon games might be better
[4:13:39] deedjay__tr: idk why but it tasted like nothing
[4:13:39] ItsThomas__: Sounds like Genshin tbh, atleast thats what it feels like
[4:13:48] bluedude153: It would probably be less of a issue if you didnt also have to read them outloud
[4:13:49] RvLeshrac: Also the issue isn't that there's a book of text, but *only a dozen words of the text is in any way important*
[4:13:51] sammeh712: I want to love dead cells, but I struggle to get past my hatred for the hand of the King.
[4:13:52] Seekerone8: if i remember correctly it's because the writing is trying to emulate MMOs but also be entry level accessible.
[4:13:52] DancingCorpse: makes it hard to know what is important and what is not
[4:13:55] Erahadur: What do you think of the game so far?
[4:13:57] Kamakazie: I agree.  Less talk, more rock.
[4:14:06] Evilrayman1986: You want to do everything but you don't want to read everything
[4:14:07] ParAlexVR: Oh, CrossCode was nice
[4:14:16] LarkyLuna: Part of this is the game explaining the MMO mechanics that are just flavor with no impact I think + explaining the actual arpg you play
[4:14:23] Sir_Khris: one of the few RPGs I really enjoyed was SWKOTOR.
[4:14:31] LarkyLuna: there's a lot at the start
[4:14:34] Sir_Khris: maybe cause there wasn't too much text/talking. right?
[4:14:46] HolyMadman: the game's been done with the word barrage for a good bit, just keep goin'
[4:14:47] Sir_Khris: why am I saying right? this is my own experience
[4:14:59] StreamElements: Orastes just subscribed girldmBounce
[4:15:00] Orastes: Orastes subscribed with Prime. 
[4:15:05] LarkyLuna: honestly I had a lot of fun but understandable
[4:15:06] hexosm: @RvLeshrac Oh, I'm not saying they implemented that MMO feeling in the best way. At least they inject some humor during the tutorial text.
[4:15:06] RvLeshrac: In KOTOR, there's a lot of text, but you're actually making choices.
[4:15:09] B_as_in_Bacon: there were also just a bunch of different movement and battle tech explained, followed by all the world rules laid out in talking, with no distinct difference in emphasis
[4:15:23] crazytim45: I think a part of it is due to plot, since you technically skipped most of the tutorial plotwise
[4:15:26] AMB_Bakery: this game getting flushed?
[4:15:30] DancingCorpse: dm isn't invested basically
[4:15:31] Sir_Khris: I jsut remember really enjoying SWKOTOR
[4:15:37] WhiteWolfie_95: This looks like an awesome frickin game is it on steam?
[4:15:52] RvLeshrac: I think CrossCode is everywhere now.
[4:15:53] rjneuen: @whitewolfie_95 yes
[4:16:04] big_wah: RPGs have a bearable first 10 hours challenge level impossible
[4:16:07] LordBlackstar: Y'all realize the entirety of chapter 1 and 2 of this game was a tutoiral, right?
[4:16:15] B_as_in_Bacon: you shouldn't HAVE to skip most of the tutorial to make something palateable... thats like the "just wait until episode 80" argument for anime
[4:16:16] Kamakazie: It ain't for everyone. Don't sweat it.
[4:16:21] RvLeshrac: @LordBlackstar That's also a terrible thing that needs to die.
[4:16:28] WhiteWolfie_95: Heck yeaaah. I love me some old graphic styled games
[4:16:36] Kamakazie: @B_as_in_Bacon And at that point you gotta wonder if it's just Stockholm syndrome
[4:16:39] dirk_trash: Is that a player pretending to be an NPC
[4:16:41] ParAlexVR: I liked CrossCode for the story bosheepShy
[4:16:46] Seekerone8: Have you been playing all 4 hours of the stream? cuase 4 hours is barely a dip in this ocean. I'd consider it still tutorial-ish.
[4:16:48] NewBrush: just wait until you reach episode 100, that's when the tv gets good bros
[4:16:57] B_as_in_Bacon: @Kamakazie entirely
[4:17:02] RvLeshrac: @Seekerone8 Tutorial for any game that isn't like a 4x should be maybe 30 minutes.
[4:17:06] ParaMCC: ParaMCC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! Good evening
[4:17:06] StreamElements: ParaMCC just subscribed for 21 months in a row girldmBounce
[4:17:09] Sir_Khris: she has actually been playing for 3
[4:17:15] AmakanZ45: This feels very Secret of Mana with more puzzles
[4:17:27] cruisec0ntrol: Technically roasting me saying jouzu
[4:17:40] RvLeshrac: @RvLeshrac There should be an *optional* tutorial, but 30 minutes should be enough to explain all of the initial game mechanics.
[4:17:44] Sir_Khris: oh wait I forgot the girldmAKSHULLY
[4:17:47] UrsoT2: There's a lot of talking and tutorials in this part of the game, i'd say the game really starts after the duel with the annoying guy
[4:17:53] Skritty: you shouldn't notice there's a tutorial at all in a good game
[4:17:53] LordBlackstar: @RvLeshrac My point is that they really did just talk through the entire first chapter, then went and tutorialized you about it again in the second one. very much the too much "telling" issue right there. Which we both agree is really bad.
[4:17:57] surprise_chan: not really a fan when a game spends multiple chapters/hours worth of playtime in tutorials
[4:18:24] VoidedJade: Yeah, crosscode is very handholdy on the first chapter and then drops you entirely and tells you nothing for the rest of the game
[4:18:25] cruisec0ntrol: @RvLeshrac How it should always be in a game, but lately some AAA titles think youy are too stupid to figure out the controls
[4:18:43] DancingCorpse: how old is this game?
[4:18:54] NewBrush: at least you wont need to read online docs a lot to get through the game
[4:19:03] NewBrush: hopefully
[4:19:22] AremZim: this game is as open world as it can get
[4:19:23] Seekerone8: @cruisec0ntrol that's because they're catering to jame jounos, who are too stupid to do that.
[4:19:24] rjneuen: As good as this game is i completely bounced off it myself
[4:19:27] RvLeshrac: I *have* seen a streamer before intentionally completely ignore an *extremely important* tutorial and then flail about in a game for four hours, so I do understand why devs grab the player's head and hold it in place while explaining things.
[4:19:40] cruisec0ntrol: @Seekerone8 Hahahaha
[4:20:00] RvLeshrac: But yeah I hate it. Lemme turn that off.
[4:20:05] rjneuen: @RvLeshrac basically everytime i watch a streamer start a new game ever erosOMEGALUL
[4:20:10] Ryok: @DancingCorpse i think early access started in 2015 or so? actual release was in 2018 i think merodyHmm at least i first saw it as "released" in 2018
[4:20:18] Sylent_Viper: @rvleshrac sovietwomble? The man is exasperating sometimes
[4:20:19] Sir_Khris: non-stop exposition
[4:20:20] AremZim: you'll love this game, you will LEARN to love it kaneko5Knife
[4:20:23] a_o_h11: Hello DM: How goes Dot Dot Dot Exclamation point!
[4:20:26] bluedude153: If your tutorial lasts longer than the steam refund window thats a no from me man
[4:20:26] Ryok: @DancingCorpse google can probably answer it better
[4:20:29] cruisec0ntrol: I would say games are like the current version of the pokemon games where there is 5 hours of tutorial
[4:20:34] RvLeshrac: A new player to gaming needs *all* the tutorials. I just need the tutorials for your specific specialty mechanics.
[4:20:37] Kamakazie: @AremZim That sounds strangely threatening
[4:20:43] a_o_h11: I call it that cause you stuck it in my head this way
[4:20:55] big_wah: I think the devs were trying to recreate the feel of a friend showing you around when you're new to an mmo, but it doesn't work as well with an npc haha
[4:21:04] LordBlackstar: Just like a real MMO
[4:21:05] NewBrush: even if you don't like the game, it could be one of those games that might be worth it months or years later. is all good
[4:21:12] KanpekiSaru: @DancingCorpse indigogo is from 2015
[4:21:15] Alisphere: girldmSnack
[4:21:19] VoidedJade: Equipment is way more important than levels. So is your circuit. Grinding for levels is not the way to go.
[4:21:23] RvLeshrac: I think you just have nothing now, I remember enemies getting substantially easier without work.
[4:21:28] a_o_h11: Prediction of Necessary Level Grinding
[4:21:32] KanpekiSaru: release should be later
[4:21:32] big_wah: the game does open up more after this bit tho iirc
[4:21:36] Sir_Khris: heh what friend introducing me to a new MMO? All the MMOs I played were just solo experiences FeelsBadMan
[4:21:39] HolyMadman: tbf you do have like 4 unspent skill points
[4:21:41] Luska: This game had a parry mechanic that was pretty fun.
[4:21:44] Tsukinokaton: Well since we know you played mmo as kid its understandable that you have aversion to grind girldmOwo
[4:21:49] goldencecelia: levels aren't as important as equipment
[4:21:51] Craizyface: If i remember correctly, the intro and the part immediately after it also were part of the early access demo, where they obviously wanted to flex with their mechanics
[4:21:54] IBeatPandas: I've heard this game is unabashed kino, what's your thoughts so far?
[4:21:58] goldencecelia: I can agree with that much
[4:22:02] AremZim: thats why they're called "handheld games" amirite? *crickets*
[4:22:03] RvLeshrac: The starter quests are just the "How to trade" tutorial.
[4:22:16] a_o_h11: Does Level Grinding bother you at all, or are you immune to it at this point?
[4:22:18] beautifulorigin: There is no time limit on quests, so you can do them later when you return to the area
[4:22:19] cruisec0ntrol: @Sir_Khris same until I became semi-known in the coimmunity
[4:22:29] Seekerone8: yeah gear and skills are MUCH more important then levels.
[4:22:30] FrameXero: I usually just passively done quests following the story
[4:22:36] IBeatPandas: Ah so it turned into an RPG? Unfortunate naiichKEKW
[4:22:40] LordBlackstar: I feel like any time people are recommending that you skip game content something has gone terribly wrong.
[4:22:50] Kamakazie: Have you tried Streets of Rogue?
[4:22:51] Sir_Khris: naa I was just mister unknown
[4:23:05] RvLeshrac: It is true, we're kind of backseating now.
[4:23:06] AremZim: playing this solo (offstream) is great but this is as sluggish as FF16 without all the flashy cutscenes kirscheDead
[4:23:11] Sir_Khris: indeed
[4:23:14] a_o_h11: So it sounds like the game is trying to get you to backtrack, if I'm not mistaken?
[4:23:18] JustMondragon: You can't plant flowers if you haven't botany.
[4:23:22] beautifulorigin: Maybe it does need a main quest/side quest system
[4:23:26] AremZim: but it gets good after the 30th hour, maybe...
[4:23:29] B_as_in_Bacon: if I have to somehow know that something is skipable in order for it to be remotely enjoyable... and it's presented with the same tone and wall of text as the neccessary battle information, then that is a bad game
[4:23:39] IBeatPandas: I have no clue, so I can counteract the backseating with misinformation mugtubPog
[4:23:49] big_wah: I will be for real, if you're the kind of person who gets compulsive about side quests/collectibles, this game will eat you alive lol
[4:23:56] teflora: The thing about Crosscode is you have a lot of freedom on how to play it. You can focus on the main story and button mash through it. But you can also try to get all the best gear and try to get all the traders. If you want.
[4:23:59] isanh: @JustMondragon girldmNoted
[4:24:00] DancingCorpse: @AremZim can't tell if sarcasm.... kabhaaBOI
[4:24:04] cruisec0ntrol: videogame logic
[4:24:07] rjneuen: crosscode is pretty poor stream game unless maybe you're speed running it. the first playthrough really relies on you being immersive in the world/setting imo
[4:24:11] VoidedJade: There is no backtracking. Quests are optional hence why you can decline them openly. There is a main quest, it's seen on the pause menu.
[4:24:24] NewBrush: @big_wah pretty much me with most games. i barely finish story modes because of it
[4:24:26] AremZim: @DancingCorpse I played 6 hours before I dropped this game :( kirscheDead

[4:25:48] Izibuya: Wasn't there a codex that tells you stuff like what drops what I Don't really know anymore been a long way since I played this
[4:25:48] RvLeshrac: Most games are definitely not helped by their fans.

[4:26:22] bluedude153: The fighting just doesnt seem to have that much to it
[4:26:27] Seekerone8: honestly, the side quests can mostly be completed by just following the main quest, cause you'll be passing though these areas and fighting these enemire a lot.

[4:27:13] LordBlackstar: I feel like it would be one thing if it was more like Dark Souls and this was a matter of DM getting staggered while using a heavy weapon or something, but this isn't a game that screams mechanical depth.

[4:28:19] UrsoT2: I didn't mean it in a bad way, in example, it's more difficult to fight the mole mobs with melee, you're also not using the charged ranged skill that uses SP, the more ranks you have, more SP you gain to use them

[4:29:34] Krahazik: more important so hide the quest making it hard to find

[4:29:37] barrettsmithbb: girldmSnack

[4:30:00] Bazeio: D: Karaoke? NOWAYING
[4:30:06] maniifestantes: hi there, how are you feeling on the game now that you're in trail
[4:30:10] Seekerone8: It's a meta-quest for you outside of playing the fake MMO that the character is in
[4:30:17] Krahazik: I think ther eis a failure of game design there
[4:30:20] maniifestantes: aw shucks
[4:30:21] Sir_Khris: and now I will tempt DM to having hotdogs for dinner :3
[4:30:24] XerophX: L.O.L aether131MYAAAAAA
[4:30:41] Tsukinokaton: Now you can say to those 6 people how dreadfull the game was girldmWhyF
[4:30:44] sammeh712: This game is going in the trash can after stream, methinks
[4:30:45] HolyMadman: it's been a continuous frustration snowball for 3 hours
[4:30:52] Vuota: A friend of mine also was asked by fans to play this game and she...did not have a good time.
[4:30:58] RvLeshrac: I disagree with DM's taste in games sometimes, but I don't think I've ever been able to disagree with any of the reasons she dislikes them.
[4:31:02] LordBlackstar: Can we take a moment to appreciate that we're talking about skipping the quests, and the Main Story objective specifies, very clearly, to "Be Prepared!".
[4:31:03] suJayhh: it feels like its because you're critiquing every mechanic instead of learning it
[4:31:07] cruisec0ntrol: @Sir_Khris she needs to go play a game she enjoys after this
[4:31:14] Sir_Khris: DM I think hotdogs and fries sounds REALLY good right now. maybe with beer in a, what do you call them, a "copper mule"?
[4:31:20] crazytim45: Didn't you get a quest about the 4 guilds? Talk to them back in town
[4:31:22] Skritty: seems like it has too high a ratio of RPG to action
[4:31:26] Sir_Khris: that'll come very soon I think
[4:31:28] FiftyRings: just not her type of game I guess.
[4:31:31] barrettsmithbb: LUL
[4:31:31] DancingCorpse: @LordBlackstar This ^^^ it's pretty deceptive
[4:31:32] uhKAWABUNGA: yup at any time
[4:31:38] That_juanGuy: Sorry to hear that dm hopefully you find something that will satisfy your taste?
[4:31:45] uhKAWABUNGA: so if you want aoe or single target can switch to whatever you need
[4:31:49] barrettsmithbb: I can feel the pain through the screen girldmLUL
[4:31:59] RvLeshrac: @suJayhh It's because a lot of the mechanisms in the game are simply bad design. A lot of them were *intentionally made* to mimic bad design, which is not good design.
[4:32:06] goldencecelia: 9
[4:32:08] uhKAWABUNGA: you did the ranged one lol
[4:32:12] Seekerone8: @suJayhh unfortunately that's the feeling i get too. Maybe it's just not a good stream game, because the lkearning curve is steep sometimes
[4:32:12] goldencecelia: level 9
[4:32:17] Bazeio: @barrettsmithbb Shush enjoy mald DM
[4:32:25] cruisec0ntrol: @girl_dm_  apparently the pink hedgehog is a lvl 9
[4:32:26] RvLeshrac: @RvLeshrac I *very much like CrossCode*, but all of these complaints are extremely valid.
[4:32:32] cruisec0ntrol: I call bull
[4:32:38] barrettsmithbb: @Bazeio girldmPleading
[4:32:39] Izibuya: I liked it a lot when I played it but in hindsight the start in particular is not that good. Does it get better for someone who doesn't enjoy it from the start I wouldn't know
[4:32:47] goldencecelia: they do for enemies not you
[4:32:53] cruisec0ntrol: it clearly asaw that compared to the lvl four it soaked up more dmg
[4:32:56] sensible_bones: watching chat fanboy over this game and not take criticism is painful to watch
[4:32:58] LordBlackstar: @DancingCorpse That exceeds deceptive and traipses right into outright poor design. I haven't played this game, but it makes a pretty poor impression.

[4:33:42] Izibuya: Shift I think
[4:33:46] HolyMadman: quick menu scans 'em
[4:33:48] big_wah: I liked this game but I do remember thinking they could've trimmed some stuff down and made it simpler
[4:33:48] Cptwaddle: if the pitch to a game is "Trust me it gets really good some hours in" means it's not as good a game as you think
[4:33:49] goldencecelia: levels matter for enemies but they don't matter for you
[4:33:51] RvLeshrac: @Sir_Khris It's a very popular game among people that like the game, yes.
[4:33:52] Kilius3000: sorry

[4:34:47] XerophX: @LordBlackstar it gets good only 30hours in surly thats not a commitment
[4:34:50] AremZim: this is that ProZD skit with endless quests about collecting eggs
[4:34:52] The_JPhantom: The game is quite a slog, yes
[4:34:59] big_wah: @suJayhh I mean the Xeno games also have their share of issues lol
[4:35:01] FiftyRings: idk, I thought xenoblade was pretty fun at the start?
[4:35:04] NewBrush: oh my gosh i get it now...that's how it feels...
[4:35:06] Cptwaddle: @Ryok I enjoyed one piece very early on, but I understand not everyone enjoys that

[4:36:06] Ryok: @Cptwaddle the funny thing is i ONLY liked it while luffy was assembling his original crew... once they got to alabastar i started disliking it but so many people say "trust me it gets good xyz amount of episodes in" for a lot of anime
[4:36:10] Sir_Khris: mmmm da drink
[4:36:11] Bazeio: peepoHappy drink
[4:36:13] Tsukinokaton: Cross slog
[4:36:14] Tharrick: crosscode is driving dm to drink :(
[4:36:22] FiftyRings: but xenoblade told me pretty early on that you get XP just for finding stuff, so I was like...oh fighting optional? neat.
[4:36:23] NewBrush: lol
[4:36:23] Sir_Khris: just SUPER slow o.o
[4:36:26] DancingCorpse: so it LITERALLY asked you if you want more help and then it went "lmao sorry I forgot anyways, gl"

[4:36:44] NewBrush: no
[4:36:48] Wedrikul: you've gone through a lot of ae where is essentially nothing and a lot of repeating...
[4:36:48] LordBlackstar: @XerophX A couple years back I got roped into playing FF14, that made me realize Final Fantasy as a franchise just... was never really that good.

[4:38:04] StromkoPenguin: "Well clearly you just haven't met the right one." coxDerp
[4:38:05] RvLeshrac: @Skritty This *IS* a JRPG, is the thing. Action-JRPG. Loads of text, no real decisions.
[4:38:11] Sir_Khris: because BG3 is DnD xD
[4:38:15] LordBlackstar: I'm curious whether it's an issue with RPGs or how MOST RPGs are designed
[4:38:24] goldsonic25: Oooooo crosscode
[4:38:28] Skritty: @RvLeshrac girldmNoted makes sense, its very linear
[4:38:32] Sir_Khris: right
[4:38:33] Xoronis: "Ok, but girldm will actually like this one, for real this time"
[4:38:34] NewBrush: crosscode!
[4:38:35] gutlesscoward: I wouldn't consider this as much of an rpg
[4:38:35] Melae: So how about a Tales marathon? Kappa
[4:38:35] AremZim: yooo somebody tell DM about gacha games
[4:38:40] AmakanZ45: Okie, so no survivals and no rpgs girldmSalute
[4:38:40] VoidedJade: It's an issue with rpgs.
[4:38:41] Seekerone8: lmao, doesn't like rpg, still plays rpgs. WHY THO
[4:38:41] Skritty: what is your take of something like skyrim dm?
[4:38:43] anas_palestine68: Hello prisci37PrisciHi fubuWave
[4:38:51] RvLeshrac: And on that note, so I'm clear, JRPG is not insulting, it's a collection of design elements, which a lot of people enjoy, and a lot of people don't.
[4:38:53] FiftyRings: this is very rpg.
[4:38:54] barrettsmithbb: girldmHaha
[4:38:55] hexosm: @Seekerone8 She was asked to LUL
[4:38:55] maniifestantes: @AremZim gacha games aren't grindy if you have the money Kappa
[4:38:56] Tsukinokaton: Well most of those rpgs are made in budget without money for voice acting girldmWhyF
[4:39:00] Sir_Khris: MADGE_DM
[4:39:08] Tharrick: it's slightly amusing how many people have come in and been 'ooh, crosscode!' while dm is explaining how much she is hating this and the genre in general and won't be coming back to it
[4:39:10] LordBlackstar: Yeah, that's a super common problem with RPGs, they can't figure out how to do "Show, don't Tell" which I would assume is why you liked Elden Ring and Dark Souls.
[4:39:11] big_wah: big brain chatters really coming out of the woodwork today
[4:39:15] CthulWho33: I find people calling this a JRPG funny. It's from Germany
[4:39:16] Skritty: girldmLUL well thats enough of an answer
[4:39:18] FiftyRings: it's an aRPG about a character in an MMO setting.
[4:39:19] NewBrush: maybe they are new to what you're interested in
[4:39:20] Bazeio: girldmHUEHUE Persona 3 when?
[4:39:20] XerophX: not even for a sweet roll?
[4:39:21] Bonisagus: It is kinda amusing tho
[4:39:23] tater1337: wasnt that the point, to have the streamer be frustrated?
[4:39:24] bluedude153: No survival games means no DM creating pokemon torture machines in Palworld :(
[4:39:25] Wedrikul: how about some Noita instead rooSip
[4:39:27] Tsukinokaton: I mean i would recommend dmc 5 or dmc4
[4:39:28] Cptwaddle: At the end of the day it's like reggie said, games are meant to be fun. if you're not having fun playing a specific game, don't force yourself to play it
[4:39:28] DancingCorpse: that could be a good youtube series.  "girl_dm_ gets mad at video games"
[4:39:35] mattmk_ii: only now you are getting that feeling ? girldmHUEHUE
[4:39:38] AremZim: "have this precious thing I enjoy" - friend, DM later clioaiBonk
[4:39:38] Melae: @CthulWho33 It's inspired by JRPGs thogh.
[4:39:40] Sir_Khris: if this game is like your 'typical' RPG then I say Skyrim is VERY much far off the beaten path
[4:39:42] RvLeshrac: @CthulWho33 Anyone can make a JRPG. Anyone can make a CRPG.
[4:39:45] Melae: though*
[4:39:50] AmakanZ45: Hmm, you've already done V Rising and Eternal Return, mmorpgs would be a no-go as well... hmm
[4:39:51] mattmk_ii: girldmLUL
[4:39:53] LordBlackstar: Lies of P is extremely good about the dialogue. Sadly, not the industry standard.
[4:39:58] sammeh712: Opinion on bloodborne?
[4:39:58] Skritty: gotta get that P5R video out so more people will know girldmLUL
[4:40:02] FennecZephyr: I have a feeling you may enjoy Pillars of Eternity, the Pathfinder games, or Rogue Trader if you like BG3
[4:40:06] StreamElements: having fun watching? 🎬 clipping is appreciated on funny and interesting moments! 🎬 dont forget to title it!!
[4:40:07] cruisec0ntrol: @Sir_Khris Into the realm of buggy bethesda games
[4:40:08] juicepunchplays: You just had enough and was like ok let's do this
[4:40:09] Seekerone8: RPGs are like drugs. Just say no
[4:40:16] NewBrush: lol
[4:40:21] sammeh712: Fair.
[4:40:22] Tsukinokaton: Well devil may cry is a thing girldmOwo
[4:40:24] CthulWho33: @RvLeshrac CRPG isn't a regional indicator
[4:40:24] bluedude153: Opinion on Bloodborne: The kart racer is going to be fun
[4:40:28] Sir_Khris: she might actually get a laugh at some random bug xD
[4:40:32] teflora: Crosscode has fairly short and quick dialog for a jrpg actually LUL
[4:40:35] FennecZephyr: Deeper CRPGs rather than JRPGs
[4:40:35] NewBrush: heh
[4:40:37] beautifulorigin: You can hit a button to skip cutscenes/text scenes
[4:40:43] LordBlackstar: So this is how the stream will end
[4:40:54] TheTommyStick: o7
[4:40:54] RvLeshrac: @CthulWho33 "CRPG" is what some people for some reason decided to call "Western RPG", I don't actually know why that latter thing exists, but they're interchangeable.
[4:40:56] KanpekiSaru: oh god
[4:40:56] Magal253: SHE IS MAD
[4:40:59] crazytim45: Someone LIED
[4:40:59] Ryok: i mean you CAN... but you'll lose ^^' but mostly because gear gives you a lot of stats
[4:41:04] goldencecelia: we never told you that
[4:41:06] Krahazik: skyrim might be risky for motion-sickness, though it can be played in 3rd person mode
[4:41:07] cruisec0ntrol: @Sir_Khris "Why is my character dancing in mid air"
[4:41:13] Cigam_HFden: so now the ultimate question is this worse than Persona?
[4:41:14] FiftyRings: if you're 3 hours in and skipping text there's too much text imo
[4:41:19] Sir_Khris: she not mad, she just being VERY rational and snarky right now
[4:41:25] Ryok: and i said... you can... you'll just lose the duel ^^
[4:41:27] RvLeshrac: @Ryok This is why people should probably not tell her things that aren't actually true.
[4:41:28] AmakanZ45: Has Bokura been recommended? it's a 2 player puzzle platformer
[4:41:37] LordBlackstar: My lord, there must be a gas leak or something in here today.
[4:41:38] maniifestantes: batatWiggle
[4:41:39] goldencecelia: I don't think we ever told you it's not a good idea to grind before hand
[4:41:40] Skritty: @Krahazik I was more wondering about the open-world RPG part of it, considering how this is a linear RPG
[4:41:40] AmakanZ45: Bokura is also on sale rn it seems
[4:41:51] electrode13_5: @AmakanZ45 shes played it on stream
[4:41:51] Ryok: @AmakanZ45 DM has played and beaten it... twice once for each side ^^
[4:42:02] Ryok: @RvLeshrac agree
[4:42:03] Bonisagus: have you considered... that you were lied to?
[4:42:16] LordBlackstar: She was literally told that in as many words

[4:42:22] AremZim: no chat audits, please DM no
[4:42:25] maniifestantes: nymnCorn
[4:42:27] hexosm: And they lost this too, huh
[4:42:29] B_as_in_Bacon: first mistake... trusting chat.
[4:42:29] AmakanZ45: @Ryok I missed that then
[4:42:35] teflora: Indeed you are
[4:42:35] Sir_Khris: oh boy
[4:42:40] Kolonel06: girldmHaha
[4:42:41] TheTommyStick: misinformation spreaded
[4:42:42] Sephim: that was something someone in chat said
[4:42:43] juicepunchplays: She is losing her mind
[4:42:47] k2kiri: girldmLUL
[4:42:50] barrettsmithbb: Plushie back seat tax! Pog
[4:42:57] DedlokPM: And by "get a plush" she means BUY a plush
[4:43:01] Bazeio: FeelsGoodMan BUY PLUSHIE
[4:43:08] sammeh712: Not being able to heal in combat is silly, imo
[4:43:09] Tharrick: i'm glad i didn't spread misinformation on this, the last twitch stream before dm leaves the country for a little while
[4:43:10] mattmk_ii: AND if you already bought one you are obligated to buy a second one
[4:43:12] cruisec0ntrol: At this point I think those people were trolling you
[4:43:21] barrettsmithbb: Having trouble reading stream information?  Buy a plushie!
[4:43:23] RvLeshrac: This is why I personally explicitly said "equipment."
[4:43:24] goldsonic25: the side quests don't give exp that much
[4:43:30] badboybass: it was all a ploy to get people to buy plushies...........
[4:43:31] braincraft: It actually is possible to win this with low stats just by dodging and hitting him during safe animations.
[4:43:32] goldsonic25: but girind mobs and getting items is importatnt
[4:43:32] Sir_Khris: and you have to fight him in a best of 5 o.o
[4:43:34] LordBlackstar: @Tharrick The bar sure is low today, but good job either way!
[4:43:36] OmegaUltima_: Are ya winning, DM?
[4:43:36] Ryok: @sammeh712 eh it's pvp i'd say it's better not being able to heal D:
[4:43:49] teflora: No disinformation chat, you can follow the main quest, buy your gear from money and be fine. Sidequest can make it alot easier with the rewards
[4:43:52] sporkmaster5000: someone said levels aren't important just your circuit (skill tree) but levels are how you advance the skill tree, so that's great advice
[4:43:52] hexosm: @goldsonic25 Eh, they kinda do though? And the quests also give equipment that's very helpful.
[4:44:05] B_as_in_Bacon: I believe it was even used as an excuse for "why the game is good" along with "just wait until the duel... it's super fun"
[4:44:16] AmakanZ45: What about the red-dead games?
[4:44:23] beautifulorigin: She's cooking
[4:44:25] FiftyRings: too much chat, this is why we don't like RPGs
[4:44:31] uhKAWABUNGA: shes doing it spwitePoggers
[4:44:34] Skritty: @AmakanZ45 she'd probably impolde
[4:44:49] sammeh712: Not that I'm guilty, but can someone drop a link to the plush? I wanna check how much it is.
[4:44:53] Tharrick: but dm, you can't comet azur
[4:44:57] goldsonic25: @hexosm Yeah the Equipment is nice felt like just having levels and store equipment is good enough if you aren't sweating

[4:45:02] electrode13_5: time for moon laser?
[4:45:03] Sir_Khris: I am so glad I did NOT buy this game. while happy to see a youtuber reviewed this game, it just didn't look all that interesting to me. seeing it in action now vindicates my decision making.
[4:45:08] NewBrush: shes doing better than me when i started
[4:45:08] LeotoBrilloVT: @sporkmaster5000 I get splitting up the advice as "Your levels are more for your skill tree, your equipment makes the bigger difference on your stats"
[4:45:09] Skritty: @sammeh712 its the pinned comment
[4:45:10] barrettsmithbb: barret56Dead
[4:45:13] braincraft: Shots do really low damage compared to melee. You have to hit him like three times as much.
[4:45:16] AmakanZ45: @Skritty prolly, you right.
[4:45:18] beautifulorigin: That was close
[4:45:19] kdefinition: Does this not stop until she wins?
[4:45:20] sammeh712: @tharrick thx
[4:45:28] redacted_panda: dm if its not fun dont play it just to appease the few that enjoy it please play something you enjoy we are her to watch you not some random game
[4:45:29] uhKAWABUNGA: @kdefinition its rounds
[4:45:35] LeotoBrilloVT: @kdefinition I'd be willing to bet it's until there's a winner.
[4:45:37] LordBlackstar: A reminder that Darkeater Midir can be beaten with a +0 Torch, no healing, no rolling, and no running. It only takes about 12 hours.
[4:45:38] Kilius3000: gamepad sems really hard
[4:45:40] AremZim: holy
[4:45:45] Evilrayman1986: Agreed 💯
[4:45:55] LeotoBrilloVT: @LordBlackstar Who wants to fight a souls boss for more then 1 hour, let alone 12?
[4:45:57] b4history1: it's joever
[4:46:08] kdefinition: @LeotoBrilloVT it's been 4 rounds. What PVP system out there is best of 7?!
[4:46:08] uhKAWABUNGA: naisuuu
[4:46:09] beautifulorigin: Clap
[4:46:10] Skritty: let her cook, rage is a great for grilling
[4:46:11] NewBrush: ooooo
[4:46:12] LarkyLuna: THE COMEBACK
[4:46:14] tangowulf: This fight is giving me Legacy of Goku flashbacks
[4:46:17] RvLeshrac: @redacted_panda It's too late, if people push something hard, they know what they're getting themselves into!
[4:46:24] LeotoBrilloVT: @kdefinition Best 5 of 9
[4:46:25] LordBlackstar: @LeotoBrilloVT I only know it's doable because some lunatic did it, I forgot to mention it was also naked and level 1.
[4:46:37] That_juanGuy: Request to change stream title to "Girl_dm shows us why she doesn't like JRPGs"
[4:46:39] hexosm: @goldsonic25 Store equipment is good enough, yeah. I personally overprepared for this fight because there's an achievement for beating Apollo without losing a single round.
[4:46:44] TheFluffyMenace: The taste of copium
[4:46:45] kdefinition: @LeotoBrilloVT That's even more ridiculous!
[4:46:46] Skritty: you can't know what you don't like without tasting a bit of everything
[4:46:48] Krahazik: And now DM can say she tried it and why she doesn't like it
[4:46:48] SpartanRyno: but not ALL experiences are valid
[4:46:50] Sephim: indeed
[4:46:54] sammeh712: What does intl mean on the shipping rates?
[4:47:04] b4history1: this doesn't look like a JRPG at all
[4:47:09] Cigam_HFden: you just transition it to a teaching japanese stream
[4:47:10] LeotoBrilloVT: @sammeh712 International.
[4:47:13] goldsonic25: @hexosm Yeah i had to redo the game to get that achievement
[4:47:17] LeotoBrilloVT: So: Outside of continential North America.
[4:47:17] tangowulf: @skritty just like bdsm
[4:47:19] AremZim: we're here for the highs and lows, go at it
[4:47:36] sammeh712: Thank you.
[4:47:42] AmakanZ45: You play the games you don't like so that the games you do like are appreciated more girldmComfy girldmComfy
[4:47:58] mattmk_ii: and if some one asks about playing this game again in the future DM can say that she played it tell the folk how she feels about the game girldmOwo
[4:48:02] uhKAWABUNGA: CLAPPED
[4:48:02] beautifulorigin: Clap
[4:48:06] LarkyLuna: not over til its over
[4:48:06] Sir_Khris: Clap
[4:48:12] b4history1: this duel is way too long bro
[4:48:19] HolyMadman: phase three!!
[4:48:19] maniifestantes: oof
[4:48:23] uhKAWABUNGA: oh snap he turned on the jets
[4:48:25] Sephim: he sure did
[4:48:25] maniifestantes: o7
[4:48:27] LordBlackstar: so can someone explain why thi sis a Bo9?
[4:48:37] Magicferret: The duels are great because the more you win the faster your opponent gets
[4:48:38] LeotoBrilloVT: *Shrugs* IDK
[4:48:40] Magal253: yeah he is smart
[4:48:40] NewBrush: pretty cool ngl
[4:48:50] BlackVulture33: oh so you can lose that duel
[4:48:55] Skritty: nice spheromancing
[4:48:56] RvLeshrac: @Magicferret That's *terrible* design.
[4:48:57] kdefinition: @LordBlackstar Because the devs have no concept of the term "familiarity breeds contempt"
[4:48:58] AremZim: that guy is your Sasuke to your Naruto
[4:49:06] hexosm: @LordBlackstar First to five wins so the opponent can gradually use more moves each round.
[4:49:09] NewBrush: @BlackVulture33 wait, you can win it first try?
[4:49:19] BlackVulture33: @BlackVulture33 i remember i did
[4:49:19] LeotoBrilloVT: @hexosm I mean: That'd still work with a best of 3.
[4:49:23] uhKAWABUNGA: @NewBrush you get an achievement for beating him first time
[4:49:27] sporkmaster5000: I did do all the grinding an quests for this game and still found the duels incredibly tedious, were people really recommending this on the back of "get to the duel?"
[4:49:28] LarkyLuna: @BlackVulture33 This is their Asylum demon, it's just 4 hours in
[4:49:35] LarkyLuna: phase 1 2 3 4 5
[4:49:36] LordBlackstar: I hate every answer I was given, for different reasons
[4:50:00] NewBrush: @uhKAWABUNGA huh, neat
[4:50:00] b4history1: copium
[4:50:10] uhKAWABUNGA: yea i died first time tho @NewBrush LUL
[4:50:13] cruisec0ntrol: Lesson to be had
[4:50:15] juicepunchplays: I think they were lying
[4:50:16] big_wah: I think they meant it gets good -after- the duel. it does open up a bit I think
[4:50:19] TheTommyStick: Seems like a weird game to try and critical path
[4:50:23] LeotoBrilloVT: I mean: The game can definitely be done that way, in the same way that a souls game can be done in one-straight shot.
[4:50:27] hexosm: @LeotoBrilloVT You're not wrong and I'm not saying it's the best design decision. Just answering why they have first to five wins.
[4:50:31] LeotoBrilloVT: If you're REALLY GOood.
[4:50:32] cruisec0ntrol: if someone says, "It is not that grindy" it is  grindy
[4:50:32] TheSilverDualGunner: so, its been a while since i played this game; but what i do remember is that i got to the final boss and was woefully underprepared and decided to drop it
[4:50:33] LordBlackstar: It's interesting, because I have generally heard good things about this game, I'm just not SEEING it right now.
[4:50:35] maniifestantes: open up to more grind hell yeah
[4:50:41] TheSilverDualGunner: so take the ignore side quests with a grain of salt
[4:50:53] BlackVulture33: @sporkmaster5000 nah the people that recommend this game for the duels were just spreading missinformation
[4:50:55] GypsybardI: girldmStrongpat
[4:51:07] HolyMadman: my gamer in Christ not needing to grind doesn't mean not needing to engage with random enemies on the way to the main objective
[4:51:10] LeotoBrilloVT: Yea, I've only playe dup to a little bit before DM is RN, and I'd say that doing sidequests are REALLY Important.
[4:51:16] Lord_Mandalore: yeah the game has good reviews just isn't everyones cup of tea
[4:51:18] Skritty: girldmSalute fair enough
[4:51:21] Sir_Khris: Maplestory isn't that grindy Kappa
[4:51:22] maniifestantes: well that is good enough
[4:51:22] hexosm: @LordBlackstar You're watching through the lens of someone who has stated they do not enjoy the game overall. Also chat's suggestions have also been a thing.
[4:51:23] KanpekiSaru: thx for palying anyway dm was fun watching :D
[4:51:24] AremZim: gg well played, you gave it a fair shake

[4:51:39] uhKAWABUNGA: sad to see you didnt enjoy it, its a fav of mine, im glad you gave it a try tho! fleshyyLov
[4:51:39] GFluegel: Gotta say, as one of the developers (and partial culprit of the frontloaded lore-hell), I REALLY enjoyed the stream, frustrations and all. xP A lot of the criticism is very valid, it was just not ideal pacing and communication in hindsight.
[4:51:39] RvLeshrac: @HolyMadman If you killed everything from the start to that character, you would be severely underpowered. That's grinding.
[4:51:42] FiftyRings: welp, gave it a shot. Not her genre
[4:51:48] Tsukinokaton: How expensive is the game?
[4:51:49] AmakanZ45: What games do you like DM?
[4:51:49] cruisec0ntrol: \Here get a new game
[4:51:50] zelul13: am back, how you do?
[4:51:51] Sir_Khris: @B_as_in_Bacon wise decision
[4:51:51] Kilius3000: developer
[4:51:57] teflora: So, you were able to just follow the main quest right? I don't see the lie
[4:51:57] NewBrush: now i see why telling is bad then, when they talk about the focus on main quest
[4:51:58] AmakanZ45: Aside from apex and league and IDV?
[4:51:59] b4history1: it'll get good after 10 hours for sure
[4:52:00] bluedude153: Eternal DM discussions: Type of games you like, why Male Gaze media is not for DM
[4:52:09] juicepunchplays: So final rating?

[4:52:22] GFluegel: I totally get it, lol. Also streaming distraction makes things harder in my experience.
[4:52:23] Tsukinokaton: Its time for some bling bang bang born girldmOwo
[4:52:30] big_wah: @GFluegel it's not for everyone but I liked the writing :>
[4:52:34] Tharrick: Tharrick gifted a Tier 1 sub to GFluegel! They have given 41 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:52:35] StreamElements: GFluegel just subscribed girldmBounce
[4:52:37] LeotoBrilloVT: if you're really good, I can see that it may be able to grind less, but like: No grind? Nah, I doubt that.
[4:52:39] OmegaUltima_: girldmHeadpat girldmHeadpat girldmHeadpat girldmHeadpat
[4:52:40] teflora: Oh hey @gfluegel
[4:52:41] HolyMadman: @RvLeshrac she skipped the entire 2nd half of the area and was still 2 levels off of Apollo are you kidding me
[4:52:42] Floral_Sloth: we gotta have someone run a background check on games before dm tries them girldmLUL
[4:52:43] cruisec0ntrol: @mattmk_ii No, it is because they are use to playing games like  monster hunter
[4:52:44] Seekerone8: @GFluegel just wanted to say, ilove the game. you guys did great. Thanks!
[4:52:46] electrode13_5: not super harsh, even as someone who loves the game, the criticism is deserved, i do wish some things like the grinding was smoother at the very least
[4:52:47] rainbowclamp443: @Bazeio KEKW WHAT DID SHE SAY
[4:52:53] KanpekiSaru: lol 2 devs in chat
[4:52:54] AremZim: writing is good lads
[4:53:02] mattmk_ii: @mattmk_ii ehh depends
[4:53:03] LordBlackstar: @hexosm I tend not to take the reactions of people as my baseline for this sort of thing. I'm just saying that the start of this game is EXTREMELY slow and annoyingly chatty. I would have quit this game pretty quick tbh. Just my opinion though.
[4:53:09] Bazeio: @rainbowclamp443 :) dont wanna spoiler, check it for yourself
[4:53:21] Tsukinokaton: I would say you may enjoy this only if you had to play something during 10h flight girldmOwo
[4:53:29] LeotoBrilloVT: She wasn't going for sidequests, but she was fightging every enemy on the way to the duel
[4:53:32] HolyMadman: I've been here since the boat
[4:53:34] teflora: Yeah JRPGs are a kinda specific gaming experience not everyone enjoys and that's 100% fair
[4:53:34] sammeh712: Well maybe not the first hour. That was just a Japanese lesson
[4:53:39] GFluegel: I saw some questionable advice but I didn't really want to spoil the fun during gameplay
[4:53:41] SmartMan: I just stepped in and I don't know anything :)
[4:53:42] That_juanGuy: She gave it the good ol collage try.
[4:53:44] LeotoBrilloVT: Also: if anyone says "Sidquests are baked into the difficulty progression", then they're not sidequests.
[4:53:44] LordBlackstar: Honestly I tuned out during that duel, nothing about it was interesting.
[4:53:49] Alisphere: girldmSnack
[4:54:08] maniifestantes: honestly this made me want to replay the game again batatFishEatingCereal
[4:54:08] Layzay73: so when's the game getting good ?
[4:54:09] mattmk_ii: @mattmk_ii i play WT that is a grind fest, but persona 5 is too much grind for me sooo
[4:54:12] Seekerone8: @HolyMadman welp, found the problem, lmao
[4:54:12] kdefinition: not grinding is when you only clear all the low level enemies 20 times, instead of 50.
[4:54:24] beautifulorigin: Why try to convince someone to change a preference?
[4:54:26] GFluegel: The intent with the early quests was that they were supposed to lead you through systems and give you starter gear. But the communication was lacking.
[4:54:30] That_juanGuy: Sorry to hear that chief, hope you find something that .ore suits your taste.
[4:54:30] double_h246: Hi, big fan! I hail from the land of the weary 101 vods, and I love your sense of humor!
[4:54:30] Skritty: If you enjoyed the slash-dash n shoot gameplay of it enough, Hyper Light Drifter is similar, but contains literally 0 dialogue
[4:54:31] LeotoBrilloVT: @Layzay73 ALso yea, we're not convincing her it gets better.
[4:54:32] Bazeio: @Layzay73 DO NOT put gasoline into the fire
[4:54:36] Symonath_: Not everyone is going to like you favorite games, it happens. Unfortunately this game didn't have enough scrungly or void dads for DM
[4:54:38] LarkyLuna: (the quest did progress since the duel outcome doesn't matter for progress xD that part wasn't a lie)
[4:54:39] Tsukinokaton: Oh no gow streamer can have different taste than chat girldmOwo. Peprostorous
[4:54:54] swaticusgaming: understandable
[4:54:54] DancingCorpse: The Streamer is allowed to not like a game.  Don't take it personally, folks.
[4:54:58] maniifestantes: 80h
[4:54:59] LeotoBrilloVT: LONG
[4:55:01] NewBrush: a lot
[4:55:02] eldraco86: there is not a single game that is for everyone. thats just a fact.
[4:55:03] b4history1: a lot of niche games have a passionate fanbase for better or worst
[4:55:04] TheTommyStick: pretty long
[4:55:04] LeotoBrilloVT: Like.....40-50 minimum
[4:55:06] StreamElements: having fun watching? 🎬 clipping is appreciated on funny and interesting moments! 🎬 dont forget to title it!!
[4:55:07] GFluegel: 40-60h
[4:55:21] LeotoBrilloVT: She's like: ~4 hjours in, and isn't enjoying it.
[4:55:22] Skritty: wowee 30-80 hours is a LONG time
[4:55:24] RvLeshrac: The *trappings of an MMO* are a good idea, but if you're not an MMO, you have to speed it up a lot.
[4:55:24] Tsukinokaton: 80h? Close to Persona territory girldmWhyF
[4:55:29] LeotoBrilloVT: If DM's not enjoying it 4 hours in, she's not gonna like it 8 hours in.
[4:55:37] LarkyLuna: 80hours is the completionist. how long to beat has it as 35 for main story
[4:55:45] LeotoBrilloVT: @girl_dm_ If you didn't enjoy this game 4 hours in, you're not gonna like it 8 or 12 hours in
[4:55:50] bluedude153: Go punch 4 plants
[4:55:50] RvLeshrac: If you *ARE* an MMO, you still need to speed it up a lot. Don't make players kill a dozen boars to get a boar skin. One boar should be enough.
[4:55:50] Draunix5: Kind of like showing that it is a thing you can do and not making you do a lot of it?
[4:55:50] LordBlackstar: That's really long. How long does it take to get good?
[4:55:53] GFluegel: Also, the early fetch quests just piled up, which was not ideal.
[4:55:55] VoidedJade: Wait people take 80 hrs for crosscode? Whack
[4:55:58] Lord_Mandalore: How Long To Beat says 35-53 hours depending on if you side side content @girl_dm_
[4:56:06] b4history1: it gets good after 100 hours trust
[4:56:12] hexosm: @LordBlackstar Streams tend to be somewhat of an echo chamber so bias often affects peoples perceptions. Good to hear you formulated your own opinion based on not enjoying the chatty dialogue and slower buildup.
[4:56:20] Tsukinokaton: Well omorii is good example of such getting back
[4:56:23] haelian: 129 raiders from haelian have joined!

[4:56:58] RedOniVA: Got here at a good time!
[4:57:00] Lord0fTheFlame: the game is slower in the start for sure, but unlocking more stuff makes it a lot more enjoyable too, that’s what I’ve heard from some others

[4:57:13] thedoxxychen: haelCat real mature
[4:57:14] FiftyRings: I kinda prefer how Xenoblade (the first one) did fetch quests. They give em to you at the beginning of an area and you get the rewards without having to revisit the giver
[4:57:14] LarkyLuna: so it's league now? girldmFear
[4:57:16] Bazeio: girldmHUEHUE sometimes?
[4:57:16] SirSaibot: girldmBongocat
[4:57:28] SirSaibot: Sometimes?
[4:57:29] LordBlackstar: @hexosm Oh for sure, it's really easy to get swept up in the mood, so to speak. Game Design is something I'm really passionate about, so I tend to really dig into the structure of things more than anything else.
[4:57:31] LeotoBrilloVT: @Lord0fTheFlame See: I can tolerate that to a small extent. This game gets a bit much for me, and I'm VERY patient.
[4:57:31] haelian: it was QUITE hard, not certain i appreciated it until the end pretty much

[4:58:17] big_wah: oh lol I knew I recognised the name, haelian's hades guides were great

[4:58:45] LordBlackstar: Fantasy, scrungly drunk men, and not overbearing dialogue
[4:58:46] haelian: lies of Pog
[4:58:49] teflora: Our next game is gonna be more fantasy! Also we learner a lot from Crosscode so all the criticism is going somewhere we promise!

[5:02:03] SirSaibot: Who do you like from buldars gate?
[5:02:04] cyberknife238: Hello
[5:02:04] hexosm: @LordBlackstar Yup, and this game has a very niche targeted audience. Chatty dialogue with a slow start and complicated puzzles. The slower start is honestly pretty normal for the JRPGs it takes inspiration from, and the game is about 40 hours to complete.
[5:02:06] LarkyLuna: this is a baby not scrungly

[5:02:28] Sir_Khris: Kenpachi Fried Chicken?
[5:02:35] LeotoBrilloVT: @mattmk_ii Which is ironic, because he's HEAVILY associated with wolves in-game
[5:02:37] TheTommyStick: just looks like most anime hair monkaHmm

[5:02:58] sammeh712: Astarion is a sass master
[5:03:01] TheSilverDualGunner: grungy
[5:03:02] TheFluffyMenace: A pretty arsehole
[5:03:02] AmakanZ45: Rather, he is lethal and dangerous
[5:03:03] Krahazik: there is also a danger factor
[5:03:07] ArdentBlazes: ASTARION is such a twink
[5:03:08] juicepunchplays: Big the cat
[5:03:08] Tharrick: he also stops being quite so pretty boy the longer you go without long resting
[5:03:10] LeotoBrilloVT: @mattmk_ii Okay you gotta be more specific, I don't understand waht you mean.
[5:03:14] hexosm: @hexosm I'll bet you if you saw gameplay like 15 hours in it'd look much better, but you need to progress to get there. Progression is something I enjoy a lot (number go up syndrome), and so are puzzles.
[5:03:15] barrettsmithbb: onigiriNodders
[5:03:22] kara_thesurvivor: we talking about pretty boys?
[5:03:24] AmakanZ45: Ban from 7DS ?
[5:03:26] ScooterBooter: boys that are problematic viennaNotes
[5:03:28] Duxana: That's not Greece there's not a single gyro in there
[5:03:32] zelul13: I thought you liked someone from Mushishi
[5:03:39] LordBlackstar: @hexosm Yeah that's pretty fair, I think the one big pitfall they absolutely ran into was leaning a bit too much into the whole "It's an MMO" thing. I played WoW, and I do not think the collect 10 Bear @$$ style quest is fun or engaging.
[5:03:47] FiftyRings: Yuri is snarky, but he doesn't really insult the player. He's more "if the system lets people suffer then I ain't following it. Chaotic Good forever"
[5:03:51] Bazeio: @ScooterBooter aether131YAYAYA DM doesnt like to fix them, just make them worst
[5:03:57] mattmk_ii: @mattmk_ii if Emperor had TTS Leman Russ  (Zoran) insult/question
[5:03:59] ScooterBooter: @ScooterBooter so true

[5:04:10] AmakanZ45: girldmSalute  Souls-like

[5:04:16] ArdentBlazes: Stance on Erin Jaegar?
[5:04:18] LeotoBrilloVT: @FiftyRings *VIGILANTISM!*
[5:04:20] electrode13_5: plenty of walls to slam face into?
[5:04:22] TheTommyStick: seems like you prefer lore to direct narrative
[5:04:26] LarkyLuna: how
[5:04:26] Bazeio: wow
[5:04:28] XerophX: aether131SlowBlink
[5:04:29] Dalxein: Fast-paced games that shove you right into the story through action, rather than a bunch of introductions.
[5:04:34] DamonKatumaru: That sounds like how long I played PSO
[5:04:35] Magicicada: my condolences
[5:04:36] mattmk_ii: @mattmk_ii its great way to get in to Warhammer 40k
[5:04:37] LeotoBrilloVT: Would DM enjoy Wacky Wahoo Haha Pizza man 5?
[5:04:39] NewBrush: nice
[5:04:42] Skritty: strangely, WoW doesn't seem like it would be your kind of game girldmLUL

[5:05:13] Lord_Mandalore: @girl_dm_ what are some of your favorite games of all time? doesn't need to be in any specific order
[5:05:14] EuDee: You don't really have to read much to play WoW, ironically
[5:05:15] LeotoBrilloVT: Also :Tales of vesperia is VERY Long, and very dialogue heavy, but at least a good....80% Of plot related dialogue is voice acted, including all the skits.
[5:05:18] crazytim45: Well, at least you pulled one thing from this: Emilienator!
[5:05:18] AmakanZ45: GW2 ?

[5:05:36] BlackVulture33: would DM like a game like Pizza Tower? it would be fun watching her play it
[5:05:36] Sir_Khris: WoW just has deep-lore
[5:05:37] TheTommyStick: I get that. I didn't have that problem with Crosscode, but I definitely had it with that first Legend of Heroes game.
[5:05:39] DancingCorpse: wow was also paid for by parents too
[5:05:39] RvLeshrac: Looking forward to the eventual YYWTGRSHYGNLSYCT playthrough
[5:05:41] Skritty: girldmNoted
[5:05:43] Sir_Khris: Warcraft-lore
[5:05:43] mattmk_ii: DM do you like the Player Character from Evil Within ?
[5:05:47] WhiteWolfie_95: Good night, catboss. I gotta do irl stuff you have a good stream! <3
[5:05:54] NewBrush: i shouldve played wow long ago then
[5:05:55] Skritty: deep lore is pretty great
[5:05:56] LeotoBrilloVT: @TheTommyStick Oh. Legends of Heroes is.....SOOOOO MUCH Writing
[5:05:58] isanh: gonna go eep as well girldmSleeb have a good one, dm and chat girldmSalute
[5:06:03] sammeh712: Sebastian castellanos
[5:06:03] Ryok: sebastian
[5:06:06] gretchgamer: I enjoyed WoW and never really understood the hate against it. I only left to try a new game
[5:06:07] bluedude153: He is a joel last of us
[5:06:08] hexosm: @LordBlackstar I agree with you, it's not a fun or interesting quest style. However, even acclaimed games like Neir Automata sill had a good amount of fetch and gathering quests. They just framed it poorly as a joke here imo.
[5:06:09] Tharrick: @isanh g'night girldmSalute
[5:06:18] That_juanGuy: What about Alan Wake?
[5:06:20] ScooterBooter: @isanh bye bye!

[5:06:24] mattmk_ii: KEKW
[5:06:25] Lord_Mandalore: in summary: girldm likes fantasy men she cant have
[5:06:25] RobSkello: i've read some of the books that were written for WoW
[5:06:26] Bazeio: wich one?
[5:06:26] Tsukinokaton: Devil may cry 5 Dante i tell you
[5:06:27] Kablae: Can we see the cool hand?
[5:06:31] Cigam_HFden: victorian era you said was the style you like
[5:06:31] sammeh712: Castiel? Kinda
[5:06:31] juicepunchplays: It's a horror survival character
[5:06:32] SpartanRyno: Sammy or dean i think
[5:06:37] GFluegel: Supernatural... That was a thing
[5:06:39] Kablae: Sick
[5:06:40] XerophX: YAY

[5:06:46] XerophX: aether131Heart
[5:06:46] Tharrick: oh that one
[5:06:49] LordBlackstar: Also worth mentioning that WoW does the majority of big story points through cutscenes, and they are very good at those. See the Wrathgate.
[5:06:50] jerieljan: As someone living under a rock, I'm surprised with your look. Looking good.
[5:06:52] GuillaumePelletier: COOL HAND COOL HAND
[5:06:53] kara_thesurvivor: i really want to see a souls like farming sim game
[5:06:54] Skritty: @hexosm you can definitely run through all of nier automata without doing any of the side-quests
[5:06:54] AmakanZ45: Last Faith is a souls-like pixel game
[5:06:55] FiftyRings: oh, have you played Nier Automata?
[5:07:00] That_juanGuy: What about Alan Wake? That kinda on the border of fantasy and reality
[5:07:00] DancingCorpse: what a cool hand
[5:07:03] Lord_Mandalore: who did you like in lies of p? i assume p was too much of a twink @girl_dm_
[5:07:10] LeotoBrilloVT: Oh no.
[5:07:13] FiftyRings: BASED
[5:07:15] mattmk_ii: ahh

[5:07:40] LordBlackstar: @Ryok Very fair, but that cutscene is great.
[5:07:43] Tsukinokaton: Would you play another nier game?
[5:07:43] Bazeio: FeelsBadMan shame we didnt spared him

[5:07:57] TheTommyStick: @TheTommyStick yeeeeeah it was brutal. I got 30 hours in and gave up, just cuz so much of the dialog did nothing. Didn't build the world didn't build the characters, felt bad.
[5:07:57] Ryok: @LordBlackstar it was definitely a VERY memorable part of the game ^^

[5:08:14] LeotoBrilloVT: *Dresses up as Solid Snake at an anime convention so Snake falls under DM's argument*
[5:08:14] Layzay73: nah Majima would attend a anime con in that fit
[5:08:15] Skritty: majima dresses even worse than like hes going to an anime con
[5:08:16] NewBrush: would you play uh...pokemon like games like...cassette beasts or monster sanctuary...
[5:08:19] BlitizSlash: Ah I see so the Witcher then?

[5:08:24] Lord_Mandalore: @girl_dm_ who are some irl famous guys you like?

[5:08:24] AremZim: but... but...
[5:08:26] Bazeio: @Layzay73 he would
[5:08:27] sammeh712: Majima can dress however he likes. He's still wild.
[5:08:28] WhiteWolfie_95: Oh you don't like modern day men? Ben franklin wants to take u out, M'lady.
[5:08:28] Krahazik: half of Majima's wardrobe from what I saw still looked like it would work in an anime convention

[5:08:39] CerinFall: Ulfric Stormcloak...
[5:08:40] Sir_Khris: wide?
[5:08:41] bluedude153: Fire Emblem fans would hunt you down if you insulted it like you did with Persona 5 lmao
[5:08:43] SirSaibot: Wide?
[5:08:43] Layzay73: ain't got a huggable waist
[5:08:43] Lord_Mandalore: geralt is too wide??

[5:08:52] barrettsmithbb: foxyjoSTRONK
[5:08:53] LordBlackstar: @hexosm I never played Nier Automata, but I will say that it is also a game that was widely considered good. Quite possible, it does go that way sometimes.
[5:08:56] Sir_Khris: oh
[5:08:57] Bazeio: Geralt has a wife... kinda
[5:09:00] SionnachTheWaterFox: you know what i can get down with hanzo, especially with one of his wolf skins
[5:09:01] electrode13_5: does having a sword add anything?
[5:09:03] Lord_Mandalore: a scrungly man with a tiny waist
[5:09:03] LeotoBrilloVT: @bluedude153 If she's being hunted by Persona fans, she doesn't need to worry about Fire emblem.
[5:09:06] Layzay73: DM you ending soon right ?
[5:09:07] B_as_in_Bacon: I will insult persona 5

[5:09:31] GeorgePlaysTwitch: what about Hwei
[5:09:32] Dalxein: I still think 3 was peak Persona, but I also know you wouldn't enjoy that one either. XD
[5:09:32] LeotoBrilloVT: If she didn't enjoy 5, she won't enjoy 3.
[5:09:32] Prophet970: Dm didn't like persona 5 peepoRiot

[5:09:50] DamonKatumaru: Good news for everyone else, though.
[5:09:50] LeotoBrilloVT: @RvLeshrac I tend to filter out emotes.
[5:09:55] NewBrush: recommending a game kinda got hard ngl
[5:09:56] Tharrick: yeah persona 3 i recall having worse mechanics than 5
[5:09:57] Tsukinokaton: Well i have no one except dante...
[5:10:03] drovak007: What is happening right now?
[5:10:06] StreamElements: having fun watching? 🎬 clipping is appreciated on funny and interesting moments! 🎬 dont forget to title it!!
[5:10:09] LordBlackstar: Persona 5 is actually a terrible story, mostly because they don't even know what their main writing motif is.
[5:10:14] AremZim: sounds familiar...
[5:10:14] sammeh712: I'm pretty sure most of us would with thanatos.
[5:10:18] Skritty: P5 was a learning experience and a half
[5:10:20] vic_weave: Now she can tell them off with AUTHORITY
[5:10:20] LeotoBrilloVT: @Tharrick The remake COULD Fix that, but also like: if she came out of 5, not liking it, she won't enjoy any version of 3.
[5:10:21] Lord_Mandalore: thats dedication
[5:10:22] Bazeio: aether131Sit DM do you still have the print from the husband or not you did last year?
[5:10:25] Garvmon: p5 had way too much hand holding for my liking
[5:10:27] RvLeshrac: Lots of people have that stupid "You absolutely must play/watch/read something to completion before you can ever have a single comment about it" idea.
[5:10:29] Kablae: Cross Code, more like ross ode... girldmSnack
[5:10:36] Skritty: she is fueled by rage

[5:10:41] Bazeio: SHE IS
[5:10:42] witsburg: it's almost like pressuring a person into playing a game has an adverse effect on their enjoyment
[5:10:43] B_as_in_Bacon: routinely does stuff out of spite
[5:10:43] bluedude153: Powered by SPITE

[5:10:56] LeotoBrilloVT: @RvLeshrac I'd say you need to play a decent chunk into it. For persona 5, if you don't like it by the time you get to....say: Your 3rd boss, you won't enjoy the rest of the game.
[5:10:58] SionnachTheWaterFox: i like modern-looking things but they've gotta be post-apoc or dystopian kinda vibes

[5:23:18] SpiritofWaterMontaru: Does Trevor Belmont count as Scrungly?
[5:23:25] SionnachTheWaterFox: Have you mentioned Blaidd? Any thoughts?
[5:23:26] ParAlexVR: Not sure if punishment will discourage or encourage them...
[5:23:26] LordBlackstar: I feel like people need to realize that anime characters aren't typically scrungly.
[5:23:28] LeotoBrilloVT: @SpiritofWaterMontaru Anime Trevor IMO ABSOLUTELY Does
[5:23:29] VenciGameDev: i think i know what scrungly is but can't figure out who's scrungly xD

[5:25:32] mattmk_ii: DM likes them Ronins
[5:25:33] ShaidzOrlite: I thought scrunkly was ugly but in an endearing way
[5:25:33] goodberge: man, I love Afro Samurai
[5:25:33] RvLeshrac: DM's first qualification is that they be scrungly, and her second qualification is that they be walking red flags.
[5:25:33] XerophX: aether131MYAAA
[5:25:42] Skritty: ragged, a little dirty, needs to shave, probably smells a bit
[5:25:47] fnahel: how'd u rate old yasuo? XD
[5:25:47] LordBlackstar: @girl_dm_ man Illidan is lookin weird today

[5:25:54] Ryomitsui000: ...so like...a hobo with a ponytail?
[5:26:01] NewBrush: ooooo cool fight
[5:26:01] hexosm: I was thinking more scrangly than scrungly I guess.
[5:26:04] GeorgePlaysTwitch: do they have to have swords? or are these optional?
[5:26:09] LeotoBrilloVT: @Ryomitsui000 They need to be visibly somewhat desheveled
[5:26:16] o0thelazyartist0o: Sick animation
[5:26:22] french4muffin: skiny man ?
[5:26:25] Bazeio: 
[5:26:30] o0thelazyartist0o: le kek
[5:26:30] NewBrush: welp putting this show on the list
[5:26:31] ShimoMochi: Then super hot lady riven comes in
[5:26:32] Skritty: swords tend to make any character better though
[5:26:32] FiftyRings: so is the skinny a part of it or is it more the battle torn slighty unkempt style?
[5:26:33] barrettsmithbb: girldmCheer_HF Clap
[5:26:34] Lord_Mandalore: so yasuos brother was innocent or no?
[5:26:39] Magicferret: So Dante from DMC?
[5:26:46] Sayanos: Scrungle
[5:26:48] BlitizSlash: Especially younger compared to him in the new cinematic
[5:26:51] NewBrush: oh its lol
[5:26:53] LeotoBrilloVT: Yasuo was innocent.
[5:26:53] RvLeshrac: Oh right they also have to be damaged, but not so damaged that she can't cause more damage.
[5:26:55] jonborgVA: framed
[5:26:56] Sir_Khris: so scrungly == 1st stage hobo then?
[5:26:57] FiftyRings: like is Geralt scrungly?
[5:27:00] Tharrick: @FiftyRings i think that's jsut to maximise waist grabbability
[5:27:00] NewBrush: tfw i gotta read the whole thing
[5:27:01] LeotoBrilloVT: Wasn't the whole thing a setup to try and kick one of them out?
[5:27:07] AmakanZ45: Yami from Black Clover?
[5:27:07] o0thelazyartist0o: So... would Raven from Tales of Vesperia be such a scrungle?
[5:27:08] Uberalfonso: eh doesn’t the term “scrungly” usually suggest that they’re a lil’ silly and goofy? these guys seem more like grizzled twinks.
[5:27:09] mattmk_ii: @Sir_Khris kinda ...?
[5:27:10] jonborgVA: I love the league Lore
[5:27:20] clockworkcontrivance: How did you feel about Trevor from the Castlevania animated show
[5:27:22] juicepunchplays: Are we gonna see his abs in the river in this video?
[5:27:27] SpiritofWaterMontaru: Now that I see what Scrungly is, I'm gonna double down and say Trevor Belmont then, specifically from the Netflix adaptation. I'll accept my punishment for being wrong.
[5:27:30] Bazeio: aether131YAYAYA Riven was used by Le  Blanc to kill Yasuo master
[5:27:30] FiftyRings: oh so it's scrungly PLUS skinny. Have you seen Samurai Champloo?
[5:27:31] GeorgePlaysTwitch: I'm just amazed about that ponytail
[5:27:38] LeotoBrilloVT: Does DMC 5 Dante SPecifically fit your crtieria or have you already decided not Dante.
[5:27:38] Lord_Mandalore: did you play that league spin off game that has yasuo in it? cant recall the name and if you did play did you like it @girl_dm_
[5:27:38] DisquetesLIVE: no crimes only sad
[5:27:40] theRx_: Columbo, but the FFX fanart of him?
[5:27:40] GeorgePlaysTwitch: so bushy
[5:27:42] Magicicada: trevor belmont my beloved
[5:27:43] fnahel: did u like the new cinematic?
[5:27:45] LordBlackstar: For anyone wondering, the person responsible for the death of Yasuo's master is Riven. It was an accident because she asked Yasuo's master to break her sword and it exploded.
[5:27:46] Naalive: "My temple can still provide a way" FOR A REUNION THAT IS girldmBongocat
[5:27:55] o0thelazyartist0o: Anybody from the  Afro Samurai series, then?

[5:28:25] Lord_Mandalore: is yasuo your number 1 guy then?
[5:28:25] jonborgVA: its so well animated
[5:28:30] NIKOvbn: ABS is too Kappa
[5:28:31] potatung: i remember the times when Yone was just a card in LoR
[5:28:31] NewBrush: was gonna say kraven from spiderman 2
[5:28:31] SpiritofWaterMontaru: You might also like Zangetsu from the Bloodstained series
[5:28:32] mattmk_ii: i wonder if you would like Susano from Smite or
[5:28:33] AmakanZ45: Yami from black clover fits the bill, but he got a bit of a waist.
[5:28:34] ParAlexVR: Sword in water, not a good idea
[5:28:37] kdefinition: Ever seen Samurai Champloo? I feel like that would have a couple scrungly boys for you to appreciate.
[5:28:38] Sir_Khris: REMEMBER, WHO YOU ARE.
[5:28:47] jonborgVA: these parts remind me of Avatar
[5:28:48] Hauwulf: how about vash/wolfwood from trigun?
[5:28:52] theRx_: Oh gods would Golden Kamuy be chockfull of the skrungles you like?
[5:28:58] LeotoBrilloVT: Is Jetstream Sam someone that qualifies or his he too smug?
[5:29:05] Bazeio: NotLikeThis those Eyes, that are about to ult me
[5:29:05] FiftyRings: Does Mugen from Samurai Champloo count or is the no facial hair a disqualifier?
[5:29:07] electrode13_5: i remember you said about 'old man who has despair, but wants hope'
[5:29:21] jonborgVA: ah yes the war
