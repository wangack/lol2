[0:12:22] Patlaf55: before 5up raid, he was on a 4 w streak
[0:12:46] bigbrother0012: I thought jhin was broken why blud losing Kappa
[0:13:00] Jaykeblakk: @muchogrande4e Double Support item is really strong bot lane.
[0:13:12] XChaoLanX: we are back in S7 relic shield/ardent censer rush meta KEKW
[0:13:31] Jaykeblakk: Perma prio, free last hits, free wards, and the end choice of the items you can do without needing to back.
[0:13:35] muchogrande4e: @Jaykeblakk Wtf is this broken stuff..u dont get reduced gold now?
[0:13:47] nickengler421: morning taco!
[0:13:48] Jaykeblakk: No. Gold isn't reduced for double support items.
[0:13:55] daze1v9: why no twitch skin
[0:14:19] Jaykeblakk: Typically you run double support items with Seraphine + Enchanter, but it works with ADC + Supp too.
[0:14:24] Syluxrox: twitch gaming? Did Jhin get banned this game?
[0:14:27] bigbrother0012: Is jhin mid as good as bot?
[0:14:29] Syluxrox: oh he got picked
[0:14:51] Syluxrox: i hate this double support item meta
[0:15:05] imthespeedboi: @bigbrother0012 i believe it's fine, but it's harder since you have to be your own peel
[0:15:06] 2Chyno: I need to go to univ in 4 hours and I'm tempted to play league. I haven't slept yet lol should I queue one game? KEKW
[0:15:08] Jaykeblakk: @Syluxrox It's the worst. Makes any lane that has the double support item unplayable.
[0:15:12] Fawnryy: taco on twitch :(
[0:15:28] Fawnryy: :) nvm
[0:15:28] Nightbot: :)
[0:15:36] ByakurenEnjoyer: wait, adcs can get the support item too?
[0:15:43] muchogrande4e: @bigbrother0012 im playing jhin mid for years..rn i dont know why but i feel super strong in mid
[0:15:48] peshecito: ratJAM  sneaky sneaky
[0:15:53] Jaykeblakk: @ByakurenEnjoyer Anyone can. Every single laner can buy it if they want.
[0:15:54] ByakurenEnjoyer: what's this weird ass tech?
[0:16:06] starhabit: jhin is life
[0:16:13] bigbrother0012: @muchogrande4e ye mid is best role
[0:16:15] muchogrande4e: @bigbrother0012 just remember to ban yasuo...even a noob yasuo can tie the lane vs jhin
[0:16:15] netheral: ratJAM
[0:16:16] starhabit: ikeepitLURK
[0:16:19] imthespeedboi: @muchogrande4e it's much more team reliant, you have to roam for ults and shit
[0:16:20] daze1v9: @IKeepItTaco u need to sell supp item fast ur bleeding so much gold
[0:16:26] 2Chyno: Jhin got banned by getting picked by enemy jhin
[0:16:38] RIDZXII: Game here for Jhin gameplay. Delivered LUL
[0:16:41] bigbrother0012: @muchogrande4e nah i ban yone
[0:16:45] muchogrande4e: @imthespeedboi i have a masttery..called whos lane is it..im #1500 or something
[0:16:53] OmgItsShweeb: @IKeepItTaco the supp has to get the cannons or you get reduced gold you have the debuff
[0:16:56] DairyChronicle: need to use supp item on mele creeps
[0:17:03] imthespeedboi: @muchogrande4e hehe, ofc, gj my dude
[0:17:06] 1samsnow1: taco facing his main Kappa
[0:17:24] imthespeedboi: @DairyChronicle not anymore, all cs give you the same amount of gold with supp item
[0:17:27] 1samsnow1: taco teaching enemy jhin Kappa
[0:17:31] muchogrande4e: @bigbrother0012 yone is very easy to beat..dont be hesitant to counter build..tabis is fine if u need it..rushing maw on jhin also fine..maw does huge on jhin
[0:17:34] WuWaEnjoyer: Hey i have a question if the enemy supporter plays soraka is it ok if your thresh builds bremble vest?
[0:17:34] ByakurenEnjoyer: @Jaykeblakk that sounds VERY broken
[0:17:37] Fawnryy: thats a good content
[0:17:42] tarierat: evil lmao
[0:17:47] Scolera_Star: cant wait for our sup item to be nerfed because adc is abusing it ikeepitRAREHANDS
[0:17:52] muchogrande4e: @imthespeedboi u just push push and perma roam..if no strong jger u just win the game
[0:17:54] DairyChronicle: @DairyChronicle it gives your support more non-supp item gold before they get penalty
[0:17:56] TheRageofAfrica: The worst form of toxicity, constructive criticism
[0:18:02] Jaykeblakk: @ByakurenEnjoyer It's insane. Free gold per minute, free last hits, perma prio, the final upgrade is free and you don't have to back for it, free wards, etc.
[0:18:10] netheral: are we back to double relic shield meta? lol
[0:18:11] pixiecat77: @Scolera_Star why every adc uses it what does it do

[0:18:19] imthespeedboi: @muchogrande4e that's why noc is my worst nightmare T_T
[0:18:23] OmgItsShweeb: @IKeepItTaco the supp has to get the cannons or you get reduced gold you have the debuff
[0:18:27] ByakurenEnjoyer: i hope they remove celestial opposition tbh
[0:18:34] Jaykeblakk: @pixiecat77 Free gold per minute, free last hits, perma prio, the final upgrade is free and you don't have to back for it, free wards, etc.
[0:18:40] 1samsnow1: my exam has FOUR seasons to read
[0:18:42] Jaykeblakk: @pixiecat77 In other words, tons of benefits and 0 drawbacks.

[0:19:16] gsus_cries: tha jhin is an autofilled adc, main supp, is it his fault??
[0:19:19] ByakurenEnjoyer: now this is the content we're all here to see
[0:19:19] Jaykeblakk: @daze1v9 Free gold per minute, free last hits, perma prio, the final upgrade is free and you don't have to back for it, free wards, etc.
[0:19:24] Therealmusty: best part of playing twitch is playing like a sneaky little roach and threading the needle
[0:19:46] muchogrande4e: @bigbrother0012 personally I go for regular fleet foot first tree and then orb+gathering strorm vs mages, overgrowth+bone plating vs ad
[0:19:49] imthespeedboi: sadge f
[0:19:55] hiimjesus01: is lethality best build now?
[0:20:02] netheral: the return of seal taco
[0:20:04] OmgItsShweeb: @IKeepItTaco the supp has to get the cannons or you get reduced gold you have the debuff. you are getting less gold from minions

[0:20:43] 1samsnow1: is that a support item you bought?
[0:20:56] imthespeedboi: @Jaykeblakk it is
[0:20:57] OmgItsShweeb: @Jaykeblakk its based on minion kill frequency look at thee debuff
[0:20:58] Jaykeblakk: @1samsnow1 Yes. Double Support item bot lane is really strong at the moment.
[0:21:06] Blockchainxd: COGGERS

[0:32:04] tremor_47: hex 100%
[0:32:09] gsus_cries: are you the real ratIRL
[0:32:11] Strydrs: ye ye
[0:32:12] imthespeedboi: YUP
[0:32:29] Jaykeblakk: @vvokhom I could be wrong though. Also, the final build part of the item gives ADC bonuses instead of just tanky supp bonuses.
[0:32:31] vvokhom: @Jaykeblakk Oh, didint know that
[0:32:32] Strydrs: so what do adcs have to do now with the supp item thingy
[0:32:58] lethalbonsai: @strydrs that item is broken for dmg
[0:33:09] lethalbonsai: ig thats ehy taco took it

[0:33:44] InkFlourish: hello hello
[0:33:45] lethalbonsai: thers 1 startin supp item
[0:33:54] Strydrs: gotcha
[0:33:55] Jaykeblakk: @IKeepItTaco No, it's just a 1 time recall.
[0:33:55] lethalbonsai: than you lvl up it
[0:33:59] lethalbonsai: to one of those
[0:34:01] Strydrs: only 1 now
[0:34:03] Strydrs: oop
[0:34:05] montypythoncode: it goes away after using, but no time limit
[0:34:05] Evi1ution: It's from the 20 min buff camps
[0:34:05] kuya_bins: one time use only
[0:34:24] InkFlourish: lol wait they picked jhin

[0:34:35] Jaykeblakk: @IKeepItTaco That's correct.

[0:35:04] s1eepofrontline: taco really said HONK SHOO MIMIMIMIMI
[0:35:34] vampata_immune: How can the enemy enjoy playing jhin? Horrible champ
[0:35:38] MysticMachia: Do  you have some good tips for dodging skillshots?
[0:35:54] Jaykeblakk: @RyucianArt I've tested it on a couple of ADC's, and while you get first auto crit, you miss out on crit for the rest of the autos, so you lose damage.
[0:36:01] Sumiko88: this adc... always sleeping...

[0:56:10] akirafudo0655: ı guess for extra gold
[0:56:14] akirafudo0655: am ı right?
[0:56:22] HawkeyeTwoTen: Two support lane is possible since there's no punishment for farming
[0:56:58] HawkeyeTwoTen: Bonus gold for just hitting champs and no punishment for farming means free gold

[0:58:01] akirafudo0655: crit jhin bad rightnow?
[0:58:21] HawkeyeTwoTen: You can literally just farm minions with a support item as an adc because there's no penalty
[0:58:30] Blockchainxd: is this a bug or intended

[1:01:58] vvokhom: 6 for melee(
[1:02:02] lokesss: is this supp item good to buy?
[1:02:07] imthespeedboi: the stats are kinda trash but it got some nice utily (offence or tankyness)
[1:02:12] wan_heda1: wait why was the cannon worth such little gold
[1:02:24] vvokhom: @wan_heda1 supp item
[1:02:33] Equinimitys: maybe the sup minion gold debuff applied
[1:02:40] HawkeyeTwoTen: So was Tyler1 just not farming fast enough and then sold once it got it's use out of it?

[1:03:29] itslordegor: @lmsoul_ in your base ,coloured in division ranks

[1:04:54] PKMN_Master_Rio: @lmsoul_ ohhh THAT'S where it was, lmao I built this last game and wondered where my statue was LUL
[1:04:56] diptera2k: @kuya_bins isn't it the one with 6?
[1:04:56] imthespeedboi: @diptera2k void grubs, when you get 5 (1buff) or 6 (2buff) you spwn liltte voidshit when you hit towers
[1:04:58] Name17200: @diptera2k if hit s tower some minions spawn, minions like bel veth

[1:05:31] VanCleef9977: whats his sec item? supp item?

[1:05:40] killzone_armed: @VanCleef9977 yes
[1:05:46] c42p: is the support item not giving minion rule were he gets less gold?
[1:05:48] ByakurenEnjoyer: @VanCleef9977 yep, the new crown
[1:06:21] PKMN_Master_Rio: does hubris work well in all adc builds?
[1:06:25] vandrelan: @InkFlourish the idea (as i figure) is that the support lingers around to get extra gold just like adc does for support's item. then he ditches it later in the game
[1:06:31] lethalbonsai: @pkmn_master_rio no
[1:06:35] vvokhom: @c42p Frow what i undersand, the penaty goes away when item is fully upgraded
[1:06:41] PKMN_Master_Rio: ah
[1:06:45] lethalbonsai: it works only for lethality users
[1:06:52] Name17200: bro that support item looks kinda broken, he cant get one shot now
[1:06:58] lethalbonsai: like hubris ashe gona be bad
[1:06:58] InkFlourish: damn
[1:06:59] killzone_armed: @vandrelan its because its for the passive the items can give when upgraded really, not gold, that is a side bonus if done properly
[1:07:08] InkFlourish: the rioter in the game looking at this: hmm
[1:07:39] vandrelan: @killzone_armed fair, but I'm more of a team player so the extra team gold is the real prize to me.
[1:07:41] venox_dank: what is the item in slot 2 and why build it?
[1:07:50] Name17200: the avengers pulled up
[1:07:55] Dexef: smash bros reference
[1:07:58] ByakurenEnjoyer: @venox_dank it's the supp item and it's broken on everyone now
[1:08:11] ByakurenEnjoyer: it's the supp item that gives you the crown passive
[1:08:15] imthespeedboi: @venox_dank new supp item

[1:20:57] Jaykeblakk: @IKeepItTaco At what HP do you typically Q/4th Baron to secure it? 1.3k?

[1:21:09] its_sonara: i saw a reddit post about it, it basically said when the adc takes the support item, they have to avoid cs'ing as much as possible and just proc the support item by poking. and the support should be farming minions. its so whack
[1:21:25] RapidfuryV2: Bloodsong seems to be the obvious choice but idk
[1:21:40] Cpt_Kaveladge: wait u dont q for mid? thought mid jhin is better

[1:32:11] z3phyr5: oh yeah wait why sup item
[1:32:19] z3phyr5: double sup item good?
[1:32:27] Crystal_Waifu: hello
[1:32:51] InkyBabaYaga: its a video game yet you worked so hard to get to the rank/elo you're at now....makes sense.
[1:33:00] cmm11_: @InkyBabaYaga likely bought it
[1:33:21] InkyBabaYaga: don't doubt it tbh
[1:33:42] Frescote: which adc best covers Jhins weaknesses? (When Jhin is a bad pick)
[1:33:45] z3phyr5: @InkyBabaYaga could buy accounts YEP but it still requires work to keep that rank
[1:34:37] z3phyr5: @Frescote aphelios with ghost KEKW
[1:34:39] RickyTheRainFrog: @coreyelle catRose
[1:34:55] nathanmelic: why the support item on both adc and supp?
[1:35:02] Frescote: @z3phyr5 can you elaborate?
[1:35:19] azmodan2000: omg does anyone kn ow why item sup ??
[1:35:34] Frescote: my intuition says vayne, xayah, aphelios would best cover Jhins bad matchups
[1:35:52] letmeouttt: @azmodan2000 new strat he's trying out, basically gives you a free item with the same gold amount
[1:36:07] NomadNoah: What's up Taco, hope you're doing well
[1:36:15] coreyelle: @RickyTheRainFrog hiya cutie ikeepitFLOWER
[1:36:23] azmodan2000: @letmeouttt ok thks but doesn't he get less money from minions ?
[1:36:26] z3phyr5: @z3phyr5 calibrum + gravitum feels like jhin and caitlyn. Flashing Gravitum Q W Infernum R feels like executing a jhin flash q w r.

[1:58:53] Frescote: @IKeepItTaco What are Jhins biggest weaknesses? What adc can I add to my pool that best covers those weaknesses?
[1:59:02] ChilaKillahs: ur supposed to leave the ranged creeps to support or just let them die
[2:00:04] clockstar_: @ChilaKillahs this just sounds not worth tho
[2:00:18] Aethersen: not for ranged champs cuz its less dmg too
[2:00:19] clockstar_: having 10 cspm sounds better than just sacking minions
[2:00:22] DwithD: not 25 cs less .it does not count
[2:00:33] Scolera_Star: this doesnt seem worth to me it seems like it creates bad habits.

[2:11:52] veileen_: Sup that much op...
[2:12:05] tunabeard: Jhin getting banned so much in my games, they're onto us
[2:12:07] Hermitch: Why atlas?
[2:12:07] veileen_: Sup item*
[2:12:33] Tafson: Is the sup item situational?
[2:12:41] veileen_: Before i think only some mage bot buy this item in duo
[2:13:18] Clainoire: wait you're playing support?
[2:13:19] Tafson: Mr Streamer we need explanation on the sup item
[2:13:22] Tafson: WE're losing our minds
[2:13:35] MysticMachia: Can't twitch poison execute?
[2:13:44] mrbobceleste: what you doing youmuu -> collector ?
[2:13:57] Tafson: @MysticMachia No it doesnt do extra damage at low health, thats what he means by execute
[2:13:57] Telekinesis_User: Pog
[2:14:07] veileen_: WHAT
[2:14:08] MysticMachia: @MysticMachia I see
[2:14:08] PKMN_Master_Rio: lmao

[2:14:09] crazzymrbc: lol
[2:14:12] Tafson: 5Head
[2:14:13] XChaoLanX: with the support item you basically get an item for free just from the passive gold @chat
[2:14:15] Junglebear1: sneaky little rat
[2:14:27] RapttorX: flashe Kappa
[2:14:28] flux3003: she greeded the flash
[2:14:35] Tafson: Mr Streamer, we need explanation on the atlas buy. We're all confused.
[2:14:46] mrbobceleste: this definitely a collector game
[2:14:50] mrbobceleste: team diff
[2:14:51] RinRichy: hes making bank with it
[2:14:56] dayennf: ratirlYikes ratirlYikes
[2:14:58] Clainoire: XChaoLanX i see what you mean but does that mean every lane builds support item now?
[2:14:59] Jaykeblakk: @Tafson He's testing it currently, but right now in High Elo Double Supp item is busted.
[2:15:02] Kari2377: Do you buy support item as starter? Or first back?
[2:15:21] lewis_5000: hi taco
[2:15:23] Tafson: LUL
[2:15:27] veileen_: LOL
[2:15:27] Jaykeblakk: You get huge amounts of stats, free wards, upgrades without needing to base, and basically permanent priority.
[2:15:36] Junglebear1: GIgaPog Lee?
[2:15:58] XChaoLanX: @Clainoire technically speaking you can. I've read that as a top laner you take the jungler's monster but I'm don't know if that actually works.
[2:15:58] Creccio: @Jaykeblakk do you sell it late game for like, IE or something?
[2:16:02] vukasin17: why is this guy so annoying
[2:16:05] RapttorX: @Kari2377 after dorans
[2:16:05] mrbobceleste: wait you're not going collector?
[2:16:11] mrbobceleste: knxCHU
[2:16:14] Jaykeblakk: @Creccio Yeah. Generally late game you sell it for something that is stronger.
[2:16:15] lavendaury: just joined how come both have a sup item?
[2:16:16] Lustaf: so we all building support item first now?
[2:16:19] XChaoLanX: never collector second
[2:16:20] Clainoire: XChaoLanX well that's a weird meta ICANT
[2:16:21] Tafson: Damn just perma + gold on each minion, + execute, + wards
[2:16:23] PKMN_Master_Rio: @vukasin17 whomst?
[2:16:29] MysticMachia: I play Jhin myself, he is really fun right now.
[2:16:30] shoannn: Yes is tier S, i confirm
[2:16:31] mrbobceleste: what would be the alternative
[2:16:36] vladmustkill: Is league more zoomed in?
[2:16:36] mrbobceleste: he got a dirk longsword
[2:16:37] Jaykeblakk: @lavendaury It's pretty strong in high elo to go double support item.
[2:16:44] Tafson: sneakyW
[2:16:48] Dubatt0: wait i just realised this is jhupport
[2:16:49] Dubatt0: pog
[2:17:02] Tafson: the HIGH bounce Jhin Q
[2:17:02] Jaykeblakk: @Dubatt0 No, Jhin isn't support.
[2:17:03] Tafson: Classic
[2:17:05] veileen_: This q like 10 sec duration xdd
[2:17:23] Dubatt0: @Jaykeblakk but he literally has support item wat
[2:17:29] Dubatt0: unless this is some new
[2:17:30] Dubatt0: tech
[2:17:30] Tafson: The high bounce on Q sometimes is nutty, takes like 4 seconds to land
[2:17:31] mrbobceleste: HUBRIS?
[2:17:34] Jaykeblakk: @Dubatt0 Ashe does too. Double Supp item is really strong.
[2:17:38] mrbobceleste: the ultra greed
[2:17:39] Dubatt0: xd?
[2:17:40] shadow_boi1: @Dubatt0 New tech
[2:17:41] agpfven: Obv lee sin doesnt see, he isblind jqjajquqjq
[2:17:43] MysticMachia: @mrbobceleste he turns into Draven
[2:17:46] rickstrife: ? how does hubris work ?
[2:17:46] tunabeard: getting less on minion gold?
[2:17:47] Jaykeblakk: High elo has double supp item all over the place.
[2:17:48] Tafson: ITs a good feeling.
[2:17:51] Dubatt0: well time to go abuse that shit
[2:17:51] tunabeard: oh bc of sup item

[2:17:56] salax33: yo u have the support item debuf
[2:17:58] mrbobceleste: hubris stacks every time you get a takedown and grants lethality fgor a minute
[2:17:58] stressfulllllll: it hits late
[2:18:30] Tafson: @IKeepItTaco Would you build atlas if you were behind? Lets say Dirk + Atlas, and you're behind 1 longsowrd

[2:28:06] Lustaf: its generating gold, it upgrades for free. you get stats, wards and a crown. did you see the reduced damage he took from thst twitch ult?
[2:28:13] mrcrime998: And what is that item??
[2:28:35] Lustaf: its just taking support item chat. and you pick the crown upgrade when it finishes

[2:30:05] demonminer3: W does 50% AD, and the armor pen makes it stronger
[2:30:06] Lustaf: everything pops.
[2:30:16] tunabeard: need a sup item command lol
[2:30:19] klauning: aah yeah makes sense
[2:30:20] zmsbandi: and is it worth it to keep the crown till the end?
[2:30:45] shadow_boi1: @zmsbandi No, you start losing dmg then, you sell when you can go full build
[2:30:48] boorchi: how are you liking the support item?

[2:32:06] shadow_boi1: @whisperst13 Free item basically, it gives gold and a bunch of wards which is useful for the map changes
[2:32:32] stressfulllllll: rank 1 global? well then i must be challenger myself LMAO
[2:32:35] HoleyShirt1: twitch got caught lvl 1 cuz he didnt respect the matchup lol

[2:33:42] subtletea43: are we back in the double targon meta but with double adcs now?
[2:33:43] b_andre98: @IKeepItTaco why the supp item?
[2:33:46] Gigaitty: most twitch mains role play as rats irl
[2:33:57] veileen_: Why don't you buy the support item first?
[2:34:00] Lustaf: @subtleroy double sup again yea. it's dumb.
[2:34:08] demonminer3: and hell, riot might fix the support item thing soon
[2:34:22] subtletea43: @Lustaf Why would riot do this? Did they not learn their lesson the first time?
[2:34:34] adamsroys: two players can buy world atlas item?
[2:34:51] chrikat2003: ARE YOU DRIVING?

[2:35:50] dmdella_: “abusing” something that clearly is gonna get patched is boring tho
[2:36:03] whisperst13: Yeah, this probably won't last long, double relic shield is not something Riot likes
[2:36:04] HoleyShirt1: @dmdella_ how so?

[2:36:14] Arklain: Literally every game, ever
[2:36:21] Smokedf: how you feeling about red side
[2:36:24] chrikat2003: what runes do you play on lethality jhin
[2:36:25] Lustaf: it should have already been hot fixed imo.  pro play with 900 wards is gonna be rough.
[2:36:31] shadow_boi1: Any just about 80% of the playerbase
[2:36:32] XLOftw: corrected: is boring for YOU
[2:36:38] leshires: but thats how the game should work, no?
[2:36:56] bigbrother0012: Free vison is broken

[2:39:31] Gigaitty: what sorcery is that?
[2:39:33] bigbrother0012: if u play good ur trolling
[2:39:40] bigbrother0012: U should be typing
[2:39:42] Lustaf: perfect game for sup item.  roaming bard so you'll still have wards for yourself.
[2:39:55] rickstrife: have you tried IE much?
[2:39:57] priceyant: what build are u going
[2:40:02] priceyant: dark harvest with hubris?
[2:40:03] subtletea43: jungling is such a stressful role. No matter what happens in the game, it's your fault. And the sadder thing is, in a lot of cases, it's true. A jungler's decisions, where they choose to be, have such a huge influence over a game.

[2:45:45] SirAdayr: its nice to have diversity in builds
[2:46:00] nitzaboss: Dearest Taco, supp gets the same gold regardless of what minion they oneshot, so casters are most worth for team gold cause it's about 21 gold per minion

[3:12:24] SuaveADC: ya, the wintrading comment alongside 9x for making a misplay are so annoying about the community nowadays
[3:12:36] demonminer3: @Xistentialist24 he meant to push U, not I. i is right next to u
[3:12:57] NapNapoleon: But yeah, isn't the support item reducing the gold gain from farming minions?

[3:22:09] shadow_boi1: @brido14 Lower the unlocked cam sensitivity, and just unlock the cam at random times to look around even if its not really necessary, like if you're walking back to lane and you're watching your teammates
[3:22:52] FeelsGoodStream: FirstTimeChatter
[3:23:33] HoleyShirt1: @brido14 you can use f1-f4 to quickly check on your teammates or rebind to keys youre more comfortable to as well, if youre struggling with camera info gathering, i personally have them on zxcv

[3:44:49] mcegginton: Raid boss malphite jesus
[3:44:49] P4hagen: Malphite has got thick skin, he'll be fine
[3:44:49] Xistentialist24: That survivability holy shit
[3:44:50] jadey_uwu: 4444
[3:44:51] takemyadvice: And I still lost!

[3:45:27] LeMarcFresh: You right.. damn
[3:45:30] MetalFire23x: :(
[3:45:35] Wind_Blade: do you have a record on total ad you got on jhin thanks to hubris?
[3:45:36] apprehensive_piano: why did collector did 8888 true damage on akali, isnt it always 4444
[3:45:38] Xistentialist24: @dbdork Pretty sure second
[3:45:41] LeMarcFresh: @apprehensive_piano it crit
[3:45:45] dccj104: final item?
[3:45:45] Alicopter: bomba damage
[3:45:47] jessicaaaaaaaaaa: jessicaaaaaaaaaa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months, currently on a 45 month streak! hey taco, really missed your streams ikeepitLOVERBOI  hope you had a great break
[3:45:48] dbdork: @Xistentialist24 thought so. Makes sense you wanna start scaling asap
[3:45:51] P4hagen: Slow motion all of a sudden wtf?
[3:45:55] Angell_exe_: i think i peaked 970 ad on jhin with hubris
[3:45:59] itLLvi: this is like rageblade jhin all over again
[3:46:03] dbdork: do yall think it would be better to go hubris first to scale quicker?
[3:46:07] dbdork: then GB
[3:46:12] hambone_cam: *boop*
[3:46:16] better_call_sion: HUH heartsteel but for ad champs?
[3:46:26] Xistentialist24: @dbdork Gotta keep fighting from early on though cuz the stacks fall off after 90 seconds
[3:46:37] TrixShow: how does hubrs work?
[3:46:39] clueless810: holy 43 stacks of hubris
[3:46:39] greengreetings: hubris not good as first item right?
[3:46:59] flux3003: NOOO not the funny number
[3:47:00] clueless810: @trixshow additional ad and infinitely stacks
[3:47:06] bbc_ppv: taco, how do you feel about zilean-jhin bot lane?
[3:47:13] Ayycisco_: gg
[3:47:15] TrixShow: @clueless810 ooh thanks
[3:47:18] henrrytw: dark harvest its better with Jhin?
[3:47:23] hambone_cam: where were the statues in their base?
[3:47:24] Xistentialist24: @TrixShow But if you go over 90 seconds without takedown stacks fall off
[3:47:24] dbdork: oh shit is it like draven axes? If you don't get kills you lose stacks?
[3:47:28] dbdork: i thought it was based on your kills
[3:47:38] Xistentialist24: So it's infinite stacking but it can "time out"
[3:47:52] beckita: Hi Taco!
[3:47:54] Wind_Blade: @Xistentialist24 only when you die
[3:47:54] Xistentialist24: You lose it to time, not deaths
[3:48:04] dbdork: right. DIdn't think you lost it with time. It's a great teamfighting item for jhin. You just hard win fights if you get a kill early
[3:48:23] connortko: connortko subscribed with Prime. 
[3:48:30] mihaidelly28: It hits faster when you auto q auto?
[3:48:38] clueless810: It’s basically AD Mejai’s, but more forgiving
[3:49:07] coldxstreams: cyclosword?
[3:49:07] dbdork: it's not ad mejai's because you don't lose stacks. You just don't have the extra damage until you get that first kill in a team fight.
[3:49:08] greengreetings: makes sense
[3:49:17] greengreetings: i was just thinking of my lethality cai build
[3:49:19] greengreetings: cait
[3:49:22] Witchuras: when lethality > crit first and vice versa?
[3:49:23] coldxstreams: double lift been rushing cyclosword and i was trying it a bit today
[3:49:26] dbdork: the base stats still make it worth it for the beginning of team fights
[3:49:27] coldxstreams: feels really good
[3:49:36] coreyelle: Taco is ur sleeb schedule fixed r u feeling good today how is life
[3:49:38] coldxstreams: not at your level but im master jhin
[3:49:39] greengreetings: 90 ad in item would be dope but still cant fit it cuz  u wanna go crit asap
[3:49:40] coreyelle: ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH
[3:49:41] clueless810: @dbdork You lose access to the stacks if you die and don’t get a kill I thought
[3:49:47] YunhoeeAteez: HEY TACO CUTIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE HOW R U KING
[3:49:47] dbdork: @clueless810 nope
[3:49:56] Anklespankin: "not at your level taco but I'm master'
[3:49:59] Gatorave2: Who else hates when they order a sweet tea and get unsweet??
[3:50:00] clueless810: Oh, I can’t read then LMAO
[3:50:09] coldxstreams: wait plays on your own is the whole thing with it to me, like you get free w off AA. been doing cyclo->collector->RFC and crushin
[3:50:16] clueless810: Ankle Pog
[3:50:20] dbdork: @clueless810 you never "lose" your stacks. You just only have access to the damage for 90 seconds after a kill. Each kill ups the amount of damage you get for the 90 seconds.
[3:50:37] centi_0: I'm not sure if you need sup for cyclo, for example druttut uses it on akshan on top
[3:50:59] bigbrother0012: Nsh is a good first item
[3:51:14] dbdork: akshan had all the tools he needs to proc alone yeah
[3:51:26] bbc_ppv: what health % does jhin's ult do max damage?
[3:51:33] dbdork: GB better you can proc when you need it. That makes sense
[3:51:39] greengreetings: bro any tips to go from D4 to Masters?
[3:51:41] Soupman456: what up taco n chat lurkk
[3:51:42] centi_0: fact, in that way you're right
[3:51:44] dbdork: plus you can GB to lane :)

[3:54:25] Chepo__: office chairs pogg
[3:54:32] shadewolfy2: Hi Taco and chat
[3:54:33] Ayycisco_: So taking heal is the highest WR but just depends on the bot match up ?
[3:54:42] bigbrother0012: U have the 500$ skin?
[3:54:46] dbdork: @Ayycisco_ also depends on your playstyle.
[3:54:48] lasha13lash: you have 3 dogos ?
[3:54:54] dbdork: if you need heal bot take heal i guess

[3:55:03] greg_ou_pas: who here appreciate KC ?

[3:55:10] applez__TTV: when move speed crit build with fleet and when lethality with dark harvest???

[3:55:46] HearthstoneVictim: hubris stacks are for 1 min after takedown right?
[3:55:49] Witchuras: @clueless810 cant carry if you dont int first
[3:55:53] Exiled_Leeoh: always start long sword 3 pots?
[3:55:56] Anklespankin: 90s @HearthstoneVictim
[3:56:06] Anklespankin: it was buffed to 15 base, 2 ad per stack, and 90s duration
[3:56:14] applez__TTV: taco, when move speed crit build with fleet and when lethality with dark harvest???
[3:56:20] HearthstoneVictim: ok thats sound better
[3:56:21] dbdork: @Exiled_Leeoh i went though a phase of only longsword 3 pots to rush leth. It really depends on your matchups though. If you can get away with it yes.
[3:56:29] bigbrother0012: Maybe he was capping we will never know

[4:10:42] matsosdm: ty
[4:10:48] beckita: I told my friend to check your stream out bc Jhin is her fave adc
[4:11:06] shadow_boi1: The truth is that taco has to play in a pond/pool to not have himself dry out and doesn't want to be known as a titty streamer for the rest of his career, his mic doesn't catch the splish splash
[4:11:19] centi_0: xd
[4:11:22] Witchuras: @shadow_boi1 NOTED
[4:11:31] shadow_boi1: @beckita That's exactly how I found out about Taco's stream nodd

[4:14:20] rexol1234: @XChaoLanX i play this game so infrequently i didnt even know this was a thing
[4:14:28] Witchuras: for your own opinion about who you like!
[4:14:34] Witchuras: *form
[4:14:36] XChaoLanX: hit minions for 10 minutes in bot lane without using any abilites and try to get as close as possible to 10 cs/min
[4:14:47] rexol1234: well my problem is that i love late game adcs and i cant play well laning phase its just awkward

[4:20:19] Witchuras: GIGACHAD
[4:20:38] Arakh4r: @lprite oh true you do, for some reason it was only the execute, but also if you have someone then the execute gives them full gold while you get a bit less
[4:20:46] better_call_sion: Taco I wonder if your ali should collect some cs himself so you dont get the penalty
[4:20:47] Witchuras: +7 per minion???????

[4:25:28] Teddyspearson: @Witchuras The only thing I can think of is that they make it more punishing to farm minions.
[4:25:34] Teddyspearson: Without the stacking
[4:25:39] bigbrother0012: @holeyshirt1 ?
[4:26:09] Witchuras: @Witchuras like lower execute hp on minions?
[4:26:10] bigbrother0012: If u can't  play vs her doesn't mean I'm wrong
[4:26:17] Evhaal: Support item meta?

[4:28:57] bigbrother0012: Let him cook
[4:28:58] Teddyspearson: @Gekoo444 Its the new meta because you basically get a free item choices from it. And there is no punishment for using it.
[4:28:58] NapNapoleon: He missed point blank
[4:28:58] gouxuu: ekko?

[4:29:51] Evhaal: I saw this support item shit on Aphelios Gaming youtube and thought it was a meme, guess not
[4:29:53] Pristinemender: @Teddyspearson i guess that'll get patched out cause that happened a few seasons ago and was busted
[4:30:00] Witchuras: @stunzeed19 well that isnt quite right
[4:30:18] Gabzz659: KEKW

[4:48:46] clueless810: Bard too tanky
[4:48:49] Meniplix: man*
[4:48:54] Pristinemender: @bigbrother0012 cause he scales more from chimes than items. so prolonged games he can build tanky and still get good damage.
[4:49:05] centi_0: i think rfc rather then hubris this game
[4:49:05] toxxnyxx: nt
[4:49:10] Cyriod: Maybe Jhin needs more mobility with movespeed and slows into these catchers and assassins, no ? what do you think @IKeepItTaco

[4:50:02] centi_0: ture their fault, but i think it was hard for you to come up to enemies, energized shots and move speed could be worthy but thats just me
[4:50:12] savor_the_flavor: oh hell yea justice is great
[4:50:16] Pristinemender: @bbc_ppv i believe that rights, but playing from red side is inherently a disadvantage with the map changes
[4:50:18] savor_the_flavor: DinoDance
[4:50:27] f0stx: Why u otp jhin ?

[5:21:03] shadow_boi1: RFC when it has the proc increases one R shot
[5:21:07] offbeatwitch: 3 isn't a very jhin number
[5:21:09] shadow_boi1: Imagine
[5:21:24] purifish: no its rovex fault
[5:21:25] InkFlourish: his ocd will go rabid if you make it 3
[5:21:31] bbc_ppv: 3 is 5. 5 is 4. 4 is Cosmic
[5:21:32] rphln: Change to 3 and rename to Jin
[5:21:35] MetalFire23x: Jhin r needs global range just limited vision IMO
[5:21:40] LobaaChe: @purifish rovex should be boiled fr
[5:21:44] bringmeluke: just make the W faster + 3sec snare time and it's fine
[5:21:54] bbc_ppv: range increases with each consecutive hit
[5:22:17] MetalFire23x: Oh and Jhin r misses should be able to colat like Jinx r
[5:22:17] better_call_sion: They need to make the w hitbox more consistent and that alone would be great ok
[5:22:36] bbc_ppv: 4th shpt is AOE
[5:22:53] shadow_boi1: @MetalFire23x He gets full map range but jhin's gun is bigger and it covers his vision so he just gets full fog of war like in noc ult
[5:23:35] MetalFire23x: Jhin R missile should go through champs as well so it can hit multiple and you can't block it.
[5:23:46] iBasulo: why no supp item this game? 󠀀

[5:24:31] Jocucky: Wait, what is becca cooking?
[5:24:44] shadow_boi1: And whenever Jhin kills with his R it should close their client for a curtain call

[5:25:50] MetalFire23x: In all seriousness, when you kill with curtain call, the spawned trap should fear instead of slow.
[5:26:14] MetalFire23x: Like "Oh shoot my friend just got turned into art!"
[5:26:15] purifish: LOL
[5:26:25] shadow_boi1: I love that hubris creates statues of yourself cause then you can fill the summoner's rift with real mfs

[5:32:09] MetalFire23x: Ashe needs a fang
[5:32:18] redseal16: xdd
[5:32:38] TheFlamingTiger357: 95 kill game is crazy
[5:32:42] Lazydawg1: Serpents indeed
[5:32:50] purifish: solar has fang
[5:32:51] Lazydawg1: @IKeepItTaco sell crown item
[5:33:00] Championx2: this is why i cant play LOL, imagine playing 45 minutes to lose
[5:33:19] Jazziph: @Championx2 it goes both sides
[5:33:29] clueless810: Sheesh that 1 shot
[5:33:41] savor_the_flavor: you know that is how normal sports work too
[5:33:53] offbeatwitch: you lose

[5:36:01] lightlord001100: Hey Taco, I love what you do and I wish you the best
[5:36:24] XChaoLanX: you probably need to win 40 or 50 games in a row to fix +17 per win
[5:36:26] starz0e: this game was my first time seeing the new map and items, my head hurts
[5:36:34] MetalFire23x: the points are based on your MMR which is designed to keep you in your true rank.
[5:36:35] heretokek: bruh  diamond 1 is a good rank lol
[5:36:37] TheFlamingTiger357: @IKeepItTaco did the evelyn charm mess up the flash in this?
[5:36:38] TheFlamingTiger357: https://clips.twitch.tv/IcyCrowdedDelicataPeteZaroll-DfhJp2sUSDiQA6ez

[5:36:47] heretokek: not everyone can  dedicate their lives to climnnbing to chally
[5:36:55] flatnoodle: when do you go serildas vs lord dom?
[5:37:01] better_call_sion: Wait so the only way to increase your MMR is to climb with low gains?
[5:37:09] P4hagen: The people who get really good games are the ones not playing league :0
[5:37:18] XChaoLanX: not climb with good gains, win with good gains
[5:37:20] heretokek: u right bro  im  just defending my diamond warriors
[5:37:24] XChaoLanX: climbing comes second with winning
[5:37:27] MetalFire23x: The only way to get more points is to actually improve.
[5:37:53] SaltedIIIBlueberries: If you lose more lp than gain from winning that's mean your MMR is lower than your visible rank
[5:37:57] redseal16: hello taco long time no see ok
[5:37:57] ThatOneShotBruh: This system is aids, high elo shouldn't have a difference in gains at all, it would make things waaay more competitive. Also, MMR in general changes waaay too slowly.
[5:38:04] MetalFire23x: The algorithm knows how good you really are.
[5:38:16] SplashyNA: yea just time
[5:38:36] Frolundos: what elo did u end last season?
[5:38:55] TheKitKatz: i only play like 20 games a season and it always gives me +35-40
[5:39:08] DANNYMUSCLE: on one of my fresh accounts i won 6 straight games and got placed silver 1 46 lp
[5:39:14] DancingGodzilla: but u just said a 75%win/r isnt better mmr. but get better mmr u need high win/r

[5:39:39] ThatOneShotBruh: Also, in a game that discourages snowballing and has made solo carrying extremely difficult compared to before, so expecting you to carry so hard doesn't seem like a good idea.
[5:39:44] Best_Vimby: Did Rengar just not get proper follow up in those end games fights or did he just go in at bad times? @ikeepittaco

[5:39:47] Nightbot: You can see the song on stream at the bottom left corner or the top center of the screen.
[5:39:57] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Riot is changing to new MMR system called leagueMMR later early 2024
[5:39:58] cingibimine: Stare but I wanna be challanger now
[5:39:59] P4hagen: You fix mmr by winning games above your MMR
[5:40:00] DancingGodzilla: okay gotcha

[5:40:53] r3ckl3ss04: Solar was for funning
[5:41:05] r3ckl3ss04: he even apologized to chat and said he couldn’t take the game seriously
[5:41:14] GabiR17: GabiR17 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 1 month streak! ALMOST 2 YEARS, WELCOME BACK!! ikeepitLOVERBOI ikeepitLOVERBOI
[5:41:23] ThatOneShotBruh: By this logic, someone could improve rapidly but because they have busy lives and were previously low elo, which is nonsense.
[5:41:26] hexaghoul: play serious with this PantsGrab
[5:41:27] elmo_destroyer_of_earth: Your music taste is great
[5:41:31] Best_Vimby: So AP was not the play?
[5:41:38] piekaboo: Hello taco n chat
[5:42:08] Ayycisco_: Just Sub up

[5:42:33] guchijz: he wants the raptors
[5:42:36] guchijz: as a bel veth
[5:42:38] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Typically when your MMR and visible rank out of sync is because you on winning streak and gains a lot LP, the system think that you didn't deserve the rank so it's give you negative LP
[5:42:48] ThatOneShotBruh: Sure, but the system clearly correlates more games with a higher rank, which is IMO not a good system.
[5:43:42] pavlitozzz: show runes?
[5:43:50] pacotvzz: tell us the chall story??
[5:43:56] final_zangetsu: @IKeepItTaco what resolution do you play on
[5:44:11] elmo_destroyer_of_earth: @pavlitozzz u show first
[5:44:35] kingrichardddddd: seems ok to me
[5:44:39] akathriller: Lies jk
[5:44:41] XChaoLanX: I dont think that's what people are arguing
[5:44:52] ThatOneShotBruh: But the inverse also holds, the game shouldn't boost you just because you have a lot of free time. Also, did he climb to Chally or does he have high MMR from before?
[5:45:10] XChaoLanX: riot's system is designed for you to play a lot of games
[5:45:23] better_call_sion: its based on engagament naturally
[5:45:59] better_call_sion: they want you to play a lot in my opinion
[5:46:13] better_call_sion: that will probably make you buy more skins
[5:46:15] final_zangetsu: @ThatOneShotBruh hey taco waht resolution do you  play on? 1920 X 1080 p or something higer?
[5:46:15] nickshn: sup taco hows the climb so far today?
[5:46:16] Milkaa: its a game, ofcourse they want you to play
[5:46:16] kingrichardddddd: maybe they are so skilled thjey only need a few games cus they ahve knowledge
[5:46:17] XChaoLanX: it's because their mmr is retained even if they dont play
[5:46:20] Milkaa: what is that logic
[5:46:22] Milkaa: hahaha
[5:46:24] snafkin33: nah the game artificially keeps me stuck for a while
[5:46:33] Cirysin: feel like people dont practice in draft either, just always que ranked
[5:46:37] EuCosta: EuCosta subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[5:46:40] MilkbreadSid: MilkbreadSid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 23 month streak! Jhins is back 😎 one more month to two years 🤭🤭
[5:46:40] chauchee: just went against seraph/senna as jhin i got smoked they both bought supp item
[5:46:41] imyou23: when does the game get me a decent team so i can get out of silver? T.T
[5:46:44] XChaoLanX: I dont disagree with you that people should get rewarded for playing the game very little
[5:46:52] TheKitKatz: its crazy how the game mind controls my teammates to run it down smh
[5:46:53] Infix96: nah
[5:46:54] whitehounds: @imyou23 that's a you issue not a team issue
[5:47:14] Infix96: loser queue is real
[5:47:34] itLLvi: show runes pls im in champ select
[5:47:43] imyou23: @imyou23 90% of tyew time is bad teammates
[5:47:51] whitehounds: stop blaming team mates for your loses and take accountability and play better and carry
[5:47:52] SaltedIIIBlueberries: @thatoneshotbruh it's does not. Again your MMR is out of sync because the system think your win streak based on pwned on noob
[5:48:08] zaria0zed: did you win last game with solar
[5:48:15] Cirysin: nah
[5:48:15] MaxHousee: no the reason i'm in low elo is bc i'm not using the right skin
[5:48:20] joshuawilliams: the game keeps me stuck at close to a 50% wr until I prove that I got better and learned to make less mistakes then those around me. it’s so annoying.
[5:48:26] ThatOneShotBruh: @xchaolanx exactly, I don't see how he is missing this. If I had a lot of time 5 years ago to grind the game on a new account and had hit Chally, the current system would push me up even with few games, making it easy to hit a high rank.
[5:48:29] yourlocalbicon: can anyone tell me what the status icon is beside dark harvest?
[5:48:41] Cirysin: void mites
[5:48:43] MaxHousee: @yourlocalbicon void grubs

[5:49:25] therealjade: @IKeepItTaco whats the better aphelios build?
[5:49:50] ThatOneShotBruh: @saltediiiblueberries considering the fact that I very occasionally got matched with people 1 or 2 divisions above me and had little to no problems playing against them, tge system is wrong
[5:49:54] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Check out rose alune
[5:50:36] Best_Vimby: @therealjade like ap gp kinda fun

[6:11:28] matsosdm: wdym like automatically or manually

[6:41:41] w0xell_: this item just looks perfect with this skin
[6:41:43] Mcbensky: whats the idea behing taking support item as jhin
[6:41:58] NyrZStream: @Mcbensky it's just that all supp items are op af
[6:42:21] MeerTwT: basicaly ine early farm is lower so u get ur first item faster which is abig spike on jhin i guess
[6:42:25] NyrZStream: Mcbensky and the gold handicap is not enough to not build it
[6:42:36] NyrZStream: because of how much gold the supp item generates
[6:42:43] superrenz2: just search World Atlas is broken on youtube and it will explain
[6:42:54] superrenz2: 54 seconds video
[6:43:14] FabianVenom: is comet still the best runes for lethality build?
[6:43:36] ClassicRageous: So this vision item doesnt reduce gold from minion kills?
[6:43:42] misanthropical: What a beast heimer
[6:43:44] renlupin25: This heimer is actually so cracked
[6:43:48] MeerTwT: @FabianVenom it hink it depends on who u lane versus cuz isaw many fleet even in lethality builds
[6:44:04] MeerTwT: @ClassicRageous it does
[6:44:09] superrenz2: @ClassicRageous it does 66% reduction if farmed too many minions in short amount of time
[6:44:16] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Also know as-
[6:44:40] FabianVenom: @MeerTwT True, I was thinking against really squishy comps
[6:45:04] thekillerrtf2: LOL
[6:45:17] w0xell_: zeri looks absolute garbage this season
[6:45:25] Mcbensky: is life steal worth on jhin
[6:45:41] MeerTwT: @FabianVenom i think comet/ harvest pretty insane vs quishy

[6:47:22] emma_4444_: your doggos are so cute
[6:48:16] ThatOneShotBruh: Why did you take DH last game? Is it because the lane was easy and so you didn't need sustain? Also, whqt do you think of the recommended "default" build: Youmuu's > Collector > RFC/IE > IE/RFC/LDR?
[6:48:55] AwesomeInABox: im getting 20lp for wins and losses im just a bit below where i ended last season

[7:11:24] god_apollo7: happens clicking with supports is def a coin flip
[7:11:26] joaquimmontoya: and im gold

[7:12:54] yamaarashi287: the bomb goes with him
[7:12:58] xaad7: interesting
[7:13:02] Teddyspearson: @xaad7 Only makes it so you can't hit him. But he can still take damage from sources that are on him.
[7:13:09] kudo_v9: @god_apollo7 sometimes last season jhin was like without any damage
[7:13:12] xaad7: good to know
[7:13:25] Teddyspearson: Fiddle can still suck him while he is jumping if you start it before he jumps for example.
[7:13:42] Equinimitys: this zilean is cracked

[7:14:30] Mcbensky: theres no point going red almost at all
[7:14:54] xaad7: blue kayn seems kinda ridic rn
[7:15:33] shadowlord950: @Mcbensky you know it's true if rhaastafarian is going blue kayn KEKW
[7:15:40] imyou23: hi taco,is titanic hydra worth for the aa reset or is just troll?
[7:16:08] joeblondie: it sucks to not have shiled/heal support when enemy team has fizz+kayn, that's what i can say, dunno what order this anivia picked but he is probably a degenerate
[7:16:09] fevgatos_live: zonyas
[7:16:13] Mcbensky: RFC any good this match
