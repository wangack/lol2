[0:39:28] Azelyth: @ifrahle yes, its over 120 mr now
[0:39:31] shinsora_: @bleedy19 jax got mixed damage thats why he didnt build rookern which only has magic resist
[0:39:37] noxzius999: @ifrahle thinks so yes you can now get a total of 125 mr lol

[0:40:12] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[0:40:17] seinkro: I remember divine into hull on yorick used to be crushing
[0:40:29] sif_amon: Been playing lethality + heartsteel + sundered Sky mid, anyone else tried something similar, the idea was to scale into the late game with Hubris and Heartsteel, Sundered sky for the healing amp, everything else is situational, from tank and bruiser items if I'm behind to more lethality if I'm ahead, usually end up with 4K HP and 700+ AD if I'm not being an ape
[0:40:53] shinsora_: @seinkro well divine got removed and hullbreaker got nerfed
[0:41:32] seinkro: Ik, now yorick seems useless from what im hearing but ill see myself soon

[0:42:17] waheed0o: Bro has a sexy deep voice now
[0:42:22] IN0XYGEN: why do u have a cok as a mic
[0:42:22] jofunin: @seinkro new build is titanic, sundered sky and shojin. triforce is worse now because sheen is 1k gold

[0:46:02] ftrickman: Have you tried the tank item that heals every 7 seconds
[0:46:09] darkseid46: It's like it doesn't matter whether you are fed or not as a toplaner it's always about the adc and mid lane if they are fed they can carry but for some reason it doesn't matter for top
[0:46:12] shinsora_: @hahagk_ he said riven one time

[2:15:02] intingkarthus: hubris is kinda like mejai's
[2:15:08] nintendoman_: it resets on kill

[2:15:13] catador_de_conchass: Sterak is just better
[2:15:14] qwlewzf231: u thought it was like mejais?
[2:15:15] houseofgals: good with ulty reset
[2:15:21] houseofgals: but idk how good

[2:16:07] Arzofel: it statues’ damage stacks but the 90 second damage is temporary
[2:16:20] EatBurgeria: is eclipse still good on aatrox i've seen some of my fellow golds run it but they are obv not qualified like you HmmNotes HmmNotes HmmNotes
[2:16:43] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[2:16:48] broski_gringo: Its stacks infinitly and the stacks give bonus ad for each stack and you cant loose stacks
[2:17:03] hyypnos95: hello NAAYIL
[2:17:05] aiLuvDiction: @EatBurgeria i dont think its optimal, but viable for sure
[2:17:52] intingkarthus: hubris broken confirmed

[2:20:23] topqueq: show neck
[2:20:24] nintendoman_: last season more fun imo
[2:20:26] TekkSkill: removing mythics was the right direction 100%

[2:20:30] luca_biceps_gigantic: @intingkarthus i ain't playing no jg or adc

[2:20:48] AATROXING_BBC: trueeeeeee
[2:20:55] ifrahle: @luca_biceps_gigantic I would kinda only agree with Swain Itemsation. This season is better, but for my Swain, it's just urgh. I don't like it.
[2:20:57] twistedf_: @Naayil what ab sunderes sky and eclipse ?
[2:21:04] rokiest24: The sundered sky it's like a divine sunderer but with a crit
[2:21:08] rokiest24: change my mind
[2:21:19] AATROXING_BBC: @rokiest24 nah
[2:21:21] EatBurgeria: @aiLuvDiction its better though, yh mage items are strong but its so much more playable for everyone imo

[2:22:06] nintendoman_: sundered sky hit on passive is just too good
[2:22:07] TekkSkill: removing stopwatch big qol too
[2:22:09] luca_biceps_gigantic: @luca_biceps_gigantic my opinion on this season is 50/50 i don't hate but i don't like it either
[2:22:12] luipak2: it's not for 1V1
[2:22:16] EatBurgeria: @SchneizelMD gore all over again KEKW

[2:23:11] AATROXING_BBC: @rokiest24 i guess the nerf gonna be in the cooldown
[2:23:22] aiLuvDiction: @EatBurgeria it definitely feels better, but every lobby is hyper dmg. getting rid of mythics was definitely the play, itemization is much free-er

[4:43:57] adrianna_zmora: its been like what, few days only
[4:43:58] ifrahle: DMG HP should be prior on Aatrox, since he is relied on his  hogh Q percentage to heal, more Hp more to heal which makes you tankoer. Thats my opinion.
[4:44:00] バスター4: jaksho needs base ar/mr
[4:44:03] penguinfanboy: Yo nayil have a nice stream I cant stay but I hope u play with a good winstreak

[4:44:13] wSwazy: wym you dont know man i need the build for my silver promotion
[4:44:28] drago_frago: steraks 3rd might be good 90% of the game tbh unless they have like 2 on-hits

[4:44:59] abdullah3rd: @wswazy u can build crit and still climb

[6:59:41] Nightbot: https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=naayil
[6:59:43] cheerios20203: @aiLuvDiction he says that the fitting ending they see for aatrox is like he will stay in the sword forever or something like that
[6:59:56] jerome_diazzz: how have they not ff
[6:59:59] luvpenguin_: hey naayil ur tik toks inspired me to play aatrox
[6:59:59] aiLuvDiction: lmao
[7:00:04] luvpenguin_: keep up the good work
[7:00:04] aiLuvDiction: no one's gonna kill him? L
[7:00:15] legit1hp: He got ignited guys just like in the cinematic.
[7:00:20] sayberi: Hey everyone VoHiYo
[7:00:26] billyz1412: I want to play aatrox but on my server, they ban him 24/7
[7:00:33] cheerios20203: @aiLuvDiction because they said that aatrox was a good guy and he isn't a pure evil monster like for example mordekaiser is
[7:00:43] jerryhuynh: which skin you think is the best for aatrox
[7:00:46] Ecco_Edd: I jack off thinking in you Naayil
[7:00:47] zordval: @cheerios20203 so he will be in endless suffering until the end of time?
[7:00:49] esmeraldward: wtf 17/2/10
[7:00:53] Farzalou: i see some form of irony in tryndamere having to fight off death (kindred) everytime to stay alive when he is about die. But Aatrox who genuinely wants to rest in peace can't and  HE is the one gave trynda his power.
[7:00:54] billyz1412: this skin
[7:00:55] Lesurvenant: QSS?
[7:00:57] bratanelloo: titanic hydra?
[7:01:10] tutkum41: Jaksho maybe

[7:01:37] abo3bdo_: this leona man xD
[7:01:44] cheerios20203: @zordval yes because as far as i know it's near impossible to destroy him so he will just accept his tragic fate and not cause more havoc
[7:01:47] aiLuvDiction: @cheerios20203 i feel like that employee is coping heavy. aatrox may not be pure evil, but he is far from good. i think the best end is for him to get nuked by some twink like ezreal
[7:01:49] noxzius999v2: Ez gg
[7:01:55] kaniball01: sucks :(
[7:02:00] adrianna_zmora: very nice game Sippin
[7:02:01] aiLuvDiction: and then his spirit form leaves the sword or something
[7:02:02] kaniball01: atleast lissandra tried
[7:02:03] sayberi: To the people in the chat that play aatrox, why do you do it? I can't seem to get why folk enjoy it. Not sure if I just need to play more to get the appeal
[7:02:06] ng_eugene: what was that comp. op af
[7:02:35] anilahation: bruiser items finally feel good
[7:02:35] billyz1412: AATROX IS FUN

[7:02:40] RedonicRedfire: low masta
[7:02:41] cheerios20203: @aiLuvDiction lol i mean he wants to kill himself in the end so his motive is not to destroy everyone in his path just to destroy them like mordekaiser
[7:02:42] ognox22: how is aatrox this season compared to the previous one?
[7:02:59] billyz1412: AATROX IS THE ENEMY
