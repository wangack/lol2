[2:35:51] Kitsuneechan: @FeomatarSG we could play some arams again one day xD
[2:35:58] xcalebur: can you ask whiteinn what he thinks of dawncore for me
[2:35:59] MarcosR8: @FeomatarSG thats pure factous
[2:36:03] carncs_: I feel like the thing with top lane is you can just win through split and never having to win a fight. Whereas adc you are really only useful if you are teamfighting
[2:36:15] FeomatarSG: @akeros ye, there was somewhere longer version but didnt see that in clips on caedrel channel
[2:37:13] Kitsuneechan: @carncs_  but then he might be  split pushig and getting objectives for team
[2:37:35] MarcosR8: going flying this guy
[2:37:46] nalf: @carncs_ dunno, the only time i tthought top mattered like that was when riven or fiora 1v9d
[2:37:54] brendie_x: why no navori?
[2:38:02] Samius1: Samius1 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:38:20] MarcosR8: @brendie_x maybe he get more burst on ie
[2:38:22] carncs_: @Kitsuneechan not sure if you are agreeing with me or what, but that is what I am saying. All top lane needs to do is keep pushing side lanes and they can solo win the game through towers and objs.
[2:38:22] MarcosR8: sure
[2:38:25] MarcosR8: XD
[2:39:08] Kitsuneechan: @carncs_ I agree that his role can be different but not easier/useless
[2:39:18] xcalebur: can you ask whiteinn what he thinks of dawncore for me
[2:39:21] violcncc: HUH
[2:39:31] akeros: Is it true that red side got worse w/r after the map changes
[2:39:46] carncs_: @carncs_ i mean its the same with sion, illaoi, jax, etc . Any champs similar to those you have to send at least 2-3 people to go and push them off sides.
[2:40:07] MarcosR8: @Kitsuneechan factous too, not easier but maybe if u get fed in top/jgl/mid have more impact than adc role
[2:40:36] Kitsuneechan: well that I can agree on
[2:40:56] Mayael_: Mayael_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! spktrBusiness
[2:41:02] carncs_: @Kitsuneechan right not saying it is easier per say, but in solo q you definitely have more opportunity to just solo carry without a team
[2:41:22] xcalebur: this really isnt how the game works at any decent level
[2:41:29] xcalebur: they have taken a lot of power out of split pushing
[2:41:40] Kitsuneechan: well I play supp xD
[2:41:56] greengreetings: hello Jackspectra, been watching your yt for last 2 months and just hit d4, if u have any tips for d4-masters, would hear you out.
[2:42:00] Kitsuneechan: I need someone to deal demage for me xD
[2:42:21] MarcosR8: @Kitsuneechan whats ur elo
[2:42:23] luxcux1: is your support italian
[2:42:32] Kitsuneechan: unranked xD
[2:42:34] Kitsuneechan: I suck
[2:42:44] MarcosR8: @Kitsuneechan oh
[2:42:52] xcalebur: hes from romania luxcux1
[2:42:57] MarcosR8: d1 here if u wanted duo
[2:43:01] Kitsuneechan: I havent played for 5 yrs and now I suck so hard that propably would fit even balls in :D
[2:43:41] Kitsuneechan: used to be better and good at analyse leauge:P
[2:43:55] violcncc: what is this blue effect on you
[2:44:08] steestt: is good infinity in this build?
[2:45:06] MarcosR8: spektra with nami support u pref pta or fs on lucian
[2:45:28] nalf: @carncs_ maybe its server dependent but the only champions that i was scared of were those and maybe sometimes jax but jax kinda sucked when I played so w/e
[2:45:38] viable_lol: @violcncc Its dream maker the support quest item
[2:45:46] violcncc: ok

[2:49:19] viable_lol: Dont play kaisa rn is answer XD
[2:49:24] kajo100032: @Gokusamaiso Navori is better if you are not playing with nami or milio ie is better with those 2 because of burst dmg
[2:49:24] megau7: Jack mucha suerte para el partido de mañana, aunque se que no la necesitarás 😎

[3:04:23] rexs55: Dirk being 1k is nice
[3:04:50] MarcosR8: @rexs55 has less dmg being cheaper?
[3:04:56] Walt1stic: 25 instead of 30 ad
[3:05:00] Walt1stic: but leth is full pen now so
[3:05:11] Walt1stic: should be same damage
[3:05:16] Walt1stic: for 100g less
[3:05:20] MarcosR8: @Walt1stic nice
[3:05:32] marwan_bc: look like sword art online music
[3:05:41] rexs55: the lethality being flat is better then the 5 ad

[3:06:00] xcalebur: he has 2 cs man
[3:06:12] xcalebur: he had nothing to buy last back
[3:06:14] Walt1stic: it would depend on your spell scalings, 5 AD on high scalings can be way more than 5 damage compared to like the 4ish pen you gain
[3:06:27] MikeWalter420: PogBones
[3:06:32] Walt1stic: but the lower the AD scaling the better the current dirk is now compared to s13
[3:06:38] megau7: Now 2 kills clearing wave and recall jajaja
