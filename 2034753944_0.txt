[4:40:45] Suzakus: @Ms_Teemo uhh did you know bronze disease is a common metal found on bronze artifacts because chlorine binds to the copper which functions as a catalyst for forming more of the chlorine-copper complex (eventually changing the chemical structure of the entire object and turning it into dust)

[4:41:32] SirSuchis: what i do
[4:41:34] SwiftPawsVixen: Binoculars
[4:41:40] Suzakus: you can treat bronze disease with a bath of sodium sesquicarbonate because it will withdraw the free-hanging chlorine ions from the metal and if you get them all it will no longer spread as it won't be able to catalyze it
[4:41:41] MHBlue: uhuh

[4:42:56] pandeonidae: jayce was so sad
[4:42:56] Suzakus: unfortunately the problem with sodium sesquicarbonate solution is it ends up as destroying the patina (i.e. the random stuff on the surface of the copper that it has reacted with over the years) which leads it vulnerable to binding with more copper in the future; typically the outside layer will prevent the inner pure copper from binding to chlorine nyaIgnorework

[4:46:56] rafy211: its bc ur level 11 kassadin
[4:46:57] Ms_Teemo: @Suzakus salmon is pink on the inside due to their diet so if you farm raise salmon their meat isn't pink colored. it's the same reason why flamingos are pink. so when you farm raise salmon, you specifically have to give them the "make the meat pink" chemical that isn't typically included in the farm food
[4:46:58] Mackabermags: lv 11 kassadin xdd
[4:47:00] Dracima: you hav shit itms

[4:51:22] Ms_Teemo: @Ms_Teemo uhh what about this. in Japan they used to use shaku and sun as their unit of measurement. 1 shaku = 12 sun. 1 sun is approximately 1 inch in today's measurements. on top of that, in Japanese fine dining there is an assortment of appetizers called the hassun. this dish is called the hassun because it' typically served on a plate that measures 8 sun x 8 sun on each side OkaygeBusiness

[4:52:17] Suzakus: @hi_im_soapy chisels, hammers and saws were common for the rough work, and there's various harder materials that are used to sand it down further (usually rocks) or sometimes solutions like charcoal, but it's regional and depends on exactly what you're talking about tink
[4:52:33] ImScottLol: @hi_im_soapy isn't that just erosion

[5:16:03] hi_im_soapy: @hi_im_soapy historically, there was like 6000 native languages, but its on the decline heavy (around 300 left now i tink )
[5:16:05] Jaguarpaw29: @Suzakus if your interest is religious scriptures i wonder what your motives are
[5:16:12] Suzakus: @hi_im_soapy that is a lot woah
[5:16:23] king_gargamel: I PULLED UP AND TYPING :3333
[5:16:23] hi_im_soapy: walpiri is just the most interesting one to me bc it doesnt have a fixed word order peepoSitti
[5:16:34] lotuslina: poor spica
[5:16:39] Suzakus: @Jaguarpaw29 I generally like psychological development of world explanations aka mythology and other religious texts, both modern and old peepoSitti
[5:16:47] Suzakus: @hi_im_soapy does it use declensions?
[5:17:20] allaure: Learning
[5:17:22] cheezcke: some wut
[5:17:22] allaure: nerd bitch shit in chat right now
[5:17:25] Jaguarpaw29: @Suzakus very similar interests, translations can be inaccurate i understand your desire for depth
[5:17:34] merciful__lemon: is that quantum on swain ?
[5:17:34] SellionRB: suzakus Learning
[5:17:35] BarryBuggles: @Suzakus
[5:17:39] BarryBuggles: art thief
[5:17:41] hi_im_soapy: @hi_im_soapy yea its mostly suffixes for grammatical markings and conversational context for the rest of the meaning peepoSitti
[5:17:42] TheSilentHydra: cs cleank
[5:17:45] Suzakus: I know russian and latin both have quite free word order but it has strict declensions instead but iirc both are from PIE languages
[5:17:50] Jaguarpaw29: @Suzakus im very similar but i tend to lean more towards eastern philosophy
[5:17:54] IAmDiabeticus: Well there it is lol
[5:18:07] fusionnaveen1337: How bout 600?
[5:18:11] cheezcke: Worth
[5:18:14] Suzakus: @Jaguarpaw29 OhISee I have a working knowledge of normal chinese but the subset needed to understand religious texts is way out of my depth sorry
[5:18:24] Suzakus: @hi_im_soapy NOTED so pretty similar to the PIE ones
[5:18:25] Suzakus: @BarryBuggles Erm
[5:18:29] SellionRB: eww nerds in chat
[5:18:35] Jaguarpaw29: @Suzakus if you have not read The tao te ching by lao tzu you should check it out, you can re-read the same page and learn something new literally everytime you reread it
[5:18:41] Suzakus: @Jaguarpaw29 NOTED
[5:18:48] BarryBuggles: @Suzakus isnt that what u were reading, an art thief from the 19th century or something
[5:18:48] Jaguarpaw29: its mind boggling
[5:18:49] hi_im_soapy: @Suzakus you could say 'cat sit mat' and 'sit mat cat' in walpiri and they would mean the exact same thing (or any other order really) peepoSitti
[5:18:49] BarryBuggles: Erm
