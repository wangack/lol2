[3:17:55] feedercarry4: @kylerarc i've always wondered why League players want to FF so quickly, and it's always on their death screen, like they can't stand 1 second of the grey screen. Die, throw FF, die, throw FF
[3:18:00] feedercarry4: they're not normal humans
[3:18:25] anomalous_autumn: @feedercarry4 that's a normal human response actually
[3:18:29] iitzjester: okaay
[3:18:44] Zaffety: why even play league if u cant handle playing from behind
[3:18:53] kylerarc: yeah its something im trying to work on. usually happens if my team ignores me. like we have dragon up everyone rotating but mid ignoring pings and we get collapsed on wiped and lose drag. i just gotta roll with it but i get tilted

[3:31:05] spatdbo: China super server
[3:31:16] bobjenkins: ionia is not super server
[3:31:17] Mojamsession: they have like 50 servers with names bc special
[3:31:25] bobjenkins: ionia is the 2nd best server
[3:31:32] iitzjester: what’s a super server?
[3:31:34] bobjenkins: chinese super server is the one that needs d1+
[3:31:37] Mojamsession: oh ok nm lul
[3:31:40] xxhide1: just bad start it's ok
[3:31:53] Kasiniel: we need some 80s songs to vibe
[3:32:00] taha501: Top lane is not fun this season
[3:32:03] Pr0Acid: it was an unlucky early game but then you were owning
[3:32:10] xxhide1: twitch chat
[3:32:14] bobjenkins: that one sounded believable
[3:32:18] Mojamsession: @Viper we've gaslit you well

[3:33:10] DaysRiven: anyoiene can get the acc
[3:33:11] xmiketysonz: do u think riven is broken this meta ?
[3:33:15] DaysRiven: aslong as ur d1 or above
[3:33:19] DaysRiven: there just a big line
[3:33:19] bobjenkins: top lane is more fun
[3:33:29] spatdbo: Required 1000 social credit points
[3:33:33] bobjenkins: every top main is a 2 mil mastery point bruiser 1 trick
[3:33:36] Hyleaux: The one tricks are insane there
[3:33:41] Ozube: chinese ego BIG
[3:33:54] bobjenkins: i think 600?
[3:33:55] kaiserwroth: playing on super server when you're in na is like getting a false job offer and being baited to resigning your current job Susge
[3:33:58] bobjenkins: 600 was chall
[3:34:05] Mojamsession: @bobjenkins did you play against xiao chao meng? :O
[3:34:08] DaysRiven: midneast went there on the chinese server and was feeding in silver lmao
[3:34:19] bobjenkins: only played vs a few lpl pros
[3:34:23] bobjenkins: i played against breathe
[3:34:30] bobjenkins: he was on omg and they were like 10th
[3:34:39] bobjenkins: and i thought he was the best laner i played vs at that point lmao
[3:34:47] TanMan285: TanMan285 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Napoleon Dynamite for president
[3:34:55] bobjenkins: and then i played vs bin
[3:35:01] Zaffety: yo this guys pretty good on riven
[3:35:03] bobjenkins: and 3 levels i knew i could not win
[3:35:11] EsKyAttic: AHAHAH
[3:35:11] bobjenkins: best player i've ever played against period

[3:35:52] cupoferic: are there still vods of you vs bin?
[3:36:02] Zaffety: have you always mained top?
[3:36:29] Mojamsession: that came out wrong
[3:36:37] taha501: what do you think is more of a counter to riven if played at high lvl warwick or urgot?
[3:36:42] kaiserwroth: R damage needs a nerf COPIUM
[3:36:43] EsKyAttic: He was until the shy kicked his ass @mansoganzo , but overall he probably is
[3:36:47] bobjenkins: the funniest part about the server is using the danger ping
[3:36:54] lar: BANGER
[3:37:01] bobjenkins: you danger ping enemy 3 different times on 3 different wards
[3:37:08] bobjenkins: if your teammates die, it's your fault
[3:37:09] MansoGanzo: @EsKyAttic but theshy is too coinflippy, like 2 times out of 5 he will feed on the exact matchup
[3:37:13] Hyleaux: Wow, i haven't played against a singed in so long. Forgot how bad that matchup was
[3:37:16] PatroklosPappas: do you think after riot remove mr/armor shard they will give us some resistances?
[3:37:40] bobjenkins: perma freeze is not a thing in china
[3:37:43] bobjenkins: you freeze 1 wave
[3:37:45] bobjenkins: stack wave
[3:37:47] bobjenkins: slow push dive
[3:37:54] bobjenkins: you can be 0-5
[3:37:58] lindislitt: i wish that was how its here
[3:37:59] bobjenkins: but if you ping enemy tower to dive
[3:38:03] bobjenkins: your jg will come
[3:38:05] lindislitt: its so boring here
[3:38:09] kaiserwroth: this vid only shows plays where the riven is alr in a winning position monkaHmm
[3:38:13] bobjenkins: never ping assist on your side of the lane
[3:38:16] bobjenkins: only enemy tower or enemy jg camp
[3:38:17] doccota: @kaiserwroth you know why babe
[3:38:20] MansoGanzo: yes but freezing is free advantage
[3:38:26] lindislitt: AYO

[3:42:20] MansoGanzo: @AnyaLoveDucks also kaisa passive, just impossible to win 2v2
[3:42:21] DeadlyBoy1234: @KellenExil exactly, and he gets only the toxic viewers encouraging these behaviors more and more.
[3:42:37] Riqui__: Tomfoolery go ruin it for enemy top
[3:42:45] JPKratei: rip
[3:42:54] MansoGanzo: @DeadlyBoy1234 i really dont think toxic players need "encouragement"
[3:42:58] PatroklosPappas: might not be that broken with riven tho
[3:42:58] Mojamsession: @AnyaLoveDucks you mean domination secondary?
[3:43:13] KellenExil: banger song
[3:43:27] DeadlyBoy1234: @MansoGanzo nah, watching will not give u improving mentality, will only give u blaming mentalityu
[3:43:57] DeadlyBoy1234: thats how u become toxic
[3:44:02] Mojamsession: kewk
[3:44:04] kaiserwroth: @DeadlyBoy1234 that's just human behavior, since Riot refuses to fix their forced 50% winrate matchmaking algorithm they nurture and encourage this behavior
[3:44:26] ainoi: fkin american streamers dont care about their viewers... randomly 3 min ads

[3:47:17] GrumpedyGroo: poor ziggs
[3:47:47] DeadlyBoy1234: @kaiserwroth riot  is trying to implement trueskill system, as this elo system  wasnt meant for this kind of games.  can be worse than current system initially, but current matchmaking is  troll lol
[3:48:35] windieh: why didnt busio give u mid isnt he supp player?
[3:48:57] Tuoppa: Yeah but making trueskill work is going to be incredibly difficult
[3:48:59] RivenTheVillain: sometimes as a support player u gotta  just lock in yasuo
[3:49:20] Tuoppa: So it doesn't promote degenerate gameplay
[3:49:29] ChinaFighting: yasuo support only works on very very bad regions like LAN, EUW and JP
[3:49:43] DeadlyBoy1234: @ChinaFighting include OCE

[4:32:39] luca7ie1: Riven -125

[4:49:19] silentdraw_: miss the AD counterpart for Mejai´s it was just insanely fun

[4:53:10] silentdraw_: @Nuvak1711 u mean the point&click Q that always critted if u were lower than 50% or something? xD
[4:53:53] silentdraw_: @Nuvak1711 ngl i kinda like it cause u need to watch out more so u r not getting instant deleted just way more punishing now
[4:53:55] Nuvak1711: @silentdraw_ Yeah panth had a higher % base on his passive crit before his rework
[4:54:27] silentdraw_: @Nuvak1711 yee i know tbf i hated panth back then ^^
[4:54:46] silentdraw_: was just frustrating to play against

[4:57:54] Nuvak1711: Yeah his bleed didn’t process off attacks until he hit lvl 6 for his ult
[4:58:27] silentdraw_: @Nuvak1711 if they would nerf him now to that he would straight up be useless  xD

[4:59:28] silentdraw_: GG´s
[4:59:59] ReformedChampionHorizon: @nuvak1711 garen isnt played that much anymore tbh. Champ got gutted in s14, maybe after buff he'll be played more

[5:09:10] ReformedChampionHorizon: @nuvak1711 LOL yeah, dude  abuse that item a lot but even I agree how stupid those resist stats were. No reason that should exist
[5:09:48] Hyleaux: Darius should just E the camille out of dash to win, right?
