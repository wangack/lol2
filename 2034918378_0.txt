[0:46:25] Drafory: man people really go crazy for the grubs
[0:46:36] pawkinese: finna wipe the team again trying to get void grubs for the 32nd time
[0:46:39] 1TheRedFox: I NEED MY GRUBS
[0:46:56] DrunkSocialist: @The_HeraId yes, thoughtfully and in consideration of the context of the current fight?
[0:46:57] trunnpet: LMFAO WHAT IS THIS CHAT
[0:47:07] heinzbitte: void grubs were a good design change, now junglers play around top only and ignore bot
[0:47:15] dhorubaaa: @Drafory they look at the 90% winrate with 6 grubs and can't resist
[0:47:23] The_HeraId: @The_HeraId Whose got the brain cells for that. Kappa

[0:50:38] pawkinese: sylas heal is nuts
[0:50:57] barely_ironic: crazy heals
[0:51:03] reduxx24: Nashor's time for that extra auto damang
[0:51:31] lolcanti: is this song from sonic
[0:51:32] cragheart: Is % pen better with less flat pen around?
[0:52:26] PekinWoof: @lolcanti https://youtu.be/pu3SfD4jpkU?t=3187
[0:52:31] The_HeraId: @cragheart Generally depends on hiow much armor/mr is being built
[0:52:35] SpiralDizzy: if neeko ult had shield, that ult goes off
[0:52:41] SpiralDizzy: quantEmoge
[0:52:53] lolcanti: thanks king
[0:52:57] troelandius: Do you play akali?
[0:53:04] Chavita2: Good to see Pekin winning
[0:53:09] The_HeraId: @cragheart Unless something canged through, Void Staff becomes effecienct after just someone buying Merc treads on the ap side
[0:53:11] osmocapture: used to before they ruined her
[0:53:16] juniorrobertt: i wanna see you eat a banana with peel on
[0:53:30] chaoticb1ue: pekinMsmile
[0:53:32] ecpgieicg: how do you decide which champ to play?
[0:53:49] meenies: xdd
[0:53:51] spec1alsnowflake: Where ap and tank antishield
[0:53:53] SabaHyrulean: I wish I was in the universe were Pekin was a famous Yone one trick
[0:53:53] zZayday: ICANT ivern seraphine meta
[0:53:57] Xzenol: hehe
[0:53:59] jeweledwasp: Without shields half the supports in game would be useless
[0:53:59] HexAlmiah: I've been praying Riot would add a proper anti-shield AP item for forever now
[0:54:01] takabloom: yes we need more ONE SHOTS
[0:54:06] takabloom: LESS SHIELDS MORE DAMAGE
[0:54:26] dotxx3: need more accessable anti sheild items
[0:54:30] The_HeraId: @jeweledwasp Without shields half the supports in the game could get a different form of power, and not be useless
[0:54:35] lolcanti: qiyana feels so fun this season
[0:54:37] jangoer: you know what they need to do for shields. Make it so they reduce damage taken by half until the shield total is absorbed
[0:54:52] reduxx24: Xerath R should just leap out of the monitor and smash the enemy's graphics card
[0:54:53] dotxx3: hhuhh
[0:54:55] jeweledwasp: @The_HeraId By what? Healing? Then people would bitch about that instead. Or from CC.
[0:54:59] BardBard: you're flying right now
[0:55:05] romana32: @PekinWoof May you please play Veigar next game?
[0:55:07] BardBard: that mvspd
[0:55:19] The_HeraId: @The_HeraId Game already has more support for counters to both of those things
[0:55:19] dotxx3: @jeweledwasp nah bc at least theres anti heal
[0:55:22] jangoer: you still get the same amount of damage reduction but it doesnt straight absorb all of the damage
[0:55:23] chaoticb1ue: is that Jamican on Ivern?
[0:55:26] dotxx3: there is barely any anti heal
[0:55:26] romana32: okay, that's understandable
[0:55:33] dotxx3: *sheild
[0:55:39] SkrotalFury: clearly it is time to bring back Ivern mid
[0:55:40] 1kensse1: and the potions rune?
[0:55:45] jangoer: or add shield pen
[0:55:52] jeweledwasp: @dotxx3 Shields are nowhere near as strong as a full heal. Most people tend to imagine they're stronger.
[0:55:53] spec1alsnowflake: Cryptbloom seems good on veigar according to quantum
[0:55:54] ChadingoYitten: is ivern supp still viable
[0:56:02] SpiralDizzy: cryptobloom veigar is nuts demeSit
[0:56:11] RareSave: But veigar scales infinitly so could it really be that bad? @PekinWoof
[0:56:14] SpiralDizzy: 50% ap ratio heal nova
[0:56:19] chaoticb1ue: I’ll stop asking you never know anything cupicAngy
[0:56:32] DrunkSocialist: thats because youre only hitting shields
[0:56:37] The_HeraId: @chaoticb1ue PEKW
[0:56:38] P_etitdoigt: I'd just remove shield stacking. Biggest shield is kept, other one is voided. Adds a "skill" to playing shield comps
[0:56:43] ChadingoYitten: what is hapeening
[0:56:52] jeweledwasp: @P_etitdoigt Just makes shields worthless compared to healing
[0:56:55] ChadingoYitten: RUN PEKIN

[0:57:48] Di3thyl: 3 days in a row I get to be with chat! yo
[0:57:50] pawkinese: surely they built mr after that fight
[0:57:51] ChadingoYitten: @LuanHunck extra true dmg from void grub buff
[0:57:55] prettymiIk: imgayDance imgayDance imgayDance
[0:57:56] P_etitdoigt: @jeweledwasp i mean, 1 shield is fine but yas mid with ivern e + karma e is not okay
[0:58:00] SunlightGamer924: Pekin would you take the first strike rune IRL?
[0:58:02] LuanHunck: @ChadingoYitten o.o thxx
[0:58:05] kobanso: @LuanHunck new voidlings, they do some true dmg vs towers

[0:58:40] reduxx24: i wish i could snipe pekin so he could invade my jungle camps ingame
[0:58:41] juniorrobertt: i think he was typing to his teammates
[0:58:47] ComfyCandle: does horizon still give damage amp?
[0:58:49] ChadingoYitten: BIG
[0:58:55] onlym1lfs: wasnt score like 15 to 4 or something and now its this? lol
[0:58:59] Ooof: Soz, better question. What 3 champs mid should i Play that covers the most bases.
[0:59:04] itsnotmyjob2: you're about to hit like a truck
[0:59:06] ChadingoYitten: @ComfyCandle no longer on immobilization, only on spells that have more than 700 range

[1:32:38] Quadruple_Axel: @LuanHunck for whatever reason the minions you execute with support item don't count toward the penalty count. so if two people just share cs it takes really long time for them to hit penalty
