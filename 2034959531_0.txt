[2:33:28] anti_negative_: they buff support when they should be buffing adc tbh
[2:33:30] BirdsAndCarrion: They need to make the gold farmng mechanic different so that it makes the value not be there
[2:33:30] Noftie: its probably trying to balance around bronze players

[2:33:38] aIined: garbage late game anyway
[2:33:38] pielord599: @BirdsAndCarrion it feels quite insane for short trades in lane and for extended fights where you can get in and out easily. def less good for all ins
[2:33:42] anti_negative_: support is just underplayed thats why they did this
[2:33:44] neverwillno: PHREAK Listening
[2:33:51] jakeamal1961: @Lourlo they should make it where each team can only by ONE support item
