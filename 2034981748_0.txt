[1:21:41] johnepimen: at such an event i dont even want my actual friends talking to me
[1:21:42] miniWD40: I'll find someone solo who has worse seats and offer to trade my seat for theirs
[1:21:42] callmecy2197: you just pretend to go to the bathroom and never return, i guess?
[1:21:49] alberto10sanchez: I will become friends with the other people around me if I have to
[1:21:54] eddimmu: for Tayolor or Beyonce? yes grrrrl
[1:21:58] carahwheel: Ow you could go .. but move seat
[1:22:15] callmecy2197: i would also judge the other person for inviting me to an expensive concert for the first date
[1:22:16] neelerita: tell them after the concert "hey you ruined the concert for me, sorry bye"
[1:22:18] callmecy2197: honestly
[1:22:27] neelerita: block, delete, file restraining order, move on
[1:22:28] neelerita: YEP
[1:22:31] eddimmu: if its just 1 on 1 then prob awkward, but if group then ok
[1:22:32] imheter: you listen to country?
[1:22:34] renjimen005: Just pretend to record the event and don't want to include their voices.
[1:22:35] walkeryap: if we're close enough for them to give me concert tickets, i dont think i hate them enough to not go
[1:22:36] yonyooo: kinda disingenuous in a way tho
[1:22:40] callmecy2197: like cmon, girl, coffee first, everyone knows that
[1:22:56] binary_c: so you are the person ? .... who you trying to invite.
[1:23:05] PaulDelos: Coffee dates are my go to
[1:23:10] ferulics: you go for drinks or coffee, you need to be able to get out
[1:23:11] PaulDelos: Especially for first meetings
[1:23:12] eddimmu: are you paying for the ticket? or is it a treat? if youre paying then ofcourse you should go and not feel guilty
[1:23:12] callmecy2197: dinner is expensive, and also there are people that do go out with you just for the food lol
[1:23:19] johnepimen: coffee is cheap and lowkey
[1:23:27] Murry: Yeah coffees or cocktails are the play
[1:23:28] renjimen005: Wait.... Are you the one invited? or you want to invite someone?
[1:23:52] miniWD40: @renjimen005 LMAO imagine she is the horrible person tryna invite an uninterested person
[1:23:53] neelerita: coffee dates are simple, and lets you be open ended with plans outside like idk quick shopping
