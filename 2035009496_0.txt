[2:01:07] funhero2: its like if u want to be clear on who it is then you can use the female one to differentiate
[2:01:22] greenteaistea: but we don't know the gender here
[2:02:17] greenteaistea: no male version
[2:02:19] funhero2: nah, its either the 你 for male/in general, or the female one for specifically female
[2:02:31] greenteaistea: haha
[2:02:59] greenteaistea: why not just use 你 for both gender
[2:03:40] greenteaistea: 妳 is created many years after we have 你
