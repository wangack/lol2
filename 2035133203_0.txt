[0:05:39] prabbyplayz: sounds like a good morning
[0:05:56] shixzyr: hello, how you doing today?
[0:06:30] oogaboogalegend: do you try to do 10 000 steps per day or you just run ?
[0:06:41] scooterxoxo: -1 in aarhus, Denmark and I think that's too cold
[0:07:05] FeomatarSG: do you have strava?
[0:07:26] scooterxoxo: where do u walk? treadmill? I lose creativity when I wanna go many steps and it gets boring

[0:12:57] rejnes4: whats up
[0:13:03] prabbyplayz: jack, i know its a stupid question, but how do i get my cs up to like at least consistent 8-9 cspm ? i can comfortably farm 6-7 and sometimes keep it at 7 or even 8 if i'm giga ahead but i struggle to last hit (mainly in the laning phas)
[0:14:07] scooterxoxo: I mean if u mess up ur own lasthits then just get better at lasthitting. Midgame is usually the hardest necause in low elo everyoen wants the farm
[0:14:17] scooterxoxo: Or am I misunderstanding
[0:14:29] shaavola: Had a 4-22 akali oneshot me yesterday through a fking maw

[0:14:49] Krautaman: what are your biggest concern with season 14? @Jackspektra
[0:14:52] rejnes4: is this new account or what?
[0:15:24] failshot12: @prabbyplayz while lane try to get all the minions! after leaving lane it´s too much fighting in solo queue to get consistent farm
[0:15:44] prabbyplayz: hm i guess i'll just practice it in practice tool more

[0:16:33] prabbyplayz: i mean since i'm playing aphelios, i get a good amount of ad from q upgrades, so it is somewhat easier
[0:16:52] Geeving: Riot thinks its alright for new account to start in plat LUL
[0:17:25] prabbyplayz: oh yeah my friend and i both started in gold-emerald lobbies for our first game

[0:21:22] Krautaman: would you say samira is noob friendly? @Jackspektra
[0:21:45] captainkrajick: @Krautaman definitely no
[0:21:52] scooterxoxo: how do u know where u go with kalista? do you auto and then click where u wanna glide? or does it autoglide somewhere
[0:22:22] ArtyDANGER: No bork jaksho based adc build?

[0:23:09] prabbyplayz: ezreal looks like he can play this game
[0:23:52] itsredcookie: @xcalebur True, if they go Nasus supp on B4 and freeze on wave D he gets withered and dies, nice spot
[0:24:07] xcalebur: so real
[0:24:33] xArsongx: should you just take cleanse like every game on kalista? I've played her recently and exhaust kneecapped me so hard

[0:26:30] prabbyplayz: i feel my wave management is shit though too, how do i know when to slowpush, hardpush, freeze and all ?
[0:26:32] prabbyplayz: THE SNIPER
[0:26:38] xcalebur: why arent you on comms with him :(
[0:26:49] xcalebur: nash is so fkin funny

[0:27:18] rejnes4: botrk into terminus into jaksho?
[0:27:24] stevvve: its not like kalista's ad ratios are existent i think wits end is good
[0:27:25] shaavola: Termitus jaksho?
[0:27:26] prabbyplayz: wouldn't tenacity be good for the leblanc root and teemo blind
[0:27:33] stevvve: on her at least
[0:27:38] Zifi1: did you see they are thinking about bringing back duoq for master tier @Jackspektra
[0:27:52] scooterxoxo: onhit varus wits end?
[0:27:56] xcalebur: 80 on hit dmg is crazy
[0:28:01] stevvve: it also works with slows which is rly good on kalista in some games
[0:28:24] itsredcookie: @Zifi1 Isn't Jackspektra a Challenger player though? Former rank 1 I think
[0:28:41] Zifi1: he is mr redcookie
[0:28:50] ShadoPrinz: Whats your opinion on terminus?

[0:29:40] shaavola: Hexplate
[0:29:44] shaavola: 30haste
[0:29:44] itsredcookie: @stevvve If they bring it back for masters it would only be available for him whilst climbing to gm, no?
[0:30:02] shaavola: Chat>jack
[0:30:07] prabbyplayz: i need to learn my macro and tempo then i cna aactually play the role properly
[0:30:17] oogaboogalegend: rakan 10 mejai stacks
[0:30:18] captainkrajick: Does Kalista have any AP scaling?
[0:30:39] xcalebur: 4 damage
[0:30:42] stevvve: @itsredcookie he has multiple accounts and they might bring back it for masters+
[0:30:47] rejnes4: 4 dmg kekw
[0:30:49] stevvve: bring it back*
[0:31:10] captainkrajick: 4 damage per stack is not that bad
[0:31:11] Fidus44: hey jack is there a draven guide coming in the future, saw the vid, but is there a specific guide coming with build and runes?
[0:31:12] Zifi1: @stevvve nah its only for masters in the post they said
[0:31:16] xcalebur: nash should get the kills he has mejai
[0:31:28] stevvve: @Zifi1 oh alright it makes sense
[0:31:46] itsredcookie: @stevvve True, maybe he could play draven with hands and yuumi with feet
[0:31:53] captainkrajick: Rakan R damage very nice
[0:31:59] BradleyBANGER: press U to fist bump
[0:32:03] xcalebur: yes
[0:32:05] Zifi1: even if they bring back duoq for masters you still have like 700 lp to climb through compared to like gm only is like 300lp
[0:32:07] Fidus44: yes
[0:32:09] xcalebur: its so much on hit dmg

[0:32:53] stevvve: @itsredcookie one of his accounts ended masters and the other one gm last season

[0:34:23] faakiecs: Its. broken, you have perfect kitining, automatic W usage
[0:34:27] ToborDas: Why does rakan have the zaza item instead of crown item if he goes full ap?
[0:34:33] shaavola: Since this is plat/emeish

[0:34:36] FeomatarSG: for ashe kraken->trinity is still the best option?

[1:06:36] gravitytracks: "we want to put less emphasis on items and make champ abilities define how you play"
[1:06:49] stevvve: @scooterxoxo "guys just cc samira and we win dont ff"
[1:06:55] janko211: Can you cleanse his attack speed slow?
[1:07:09] Zway_lol: @janko211 Cleanse is all disables and debuffs so yes

[1:25:53] Allsido: why are you playing in G1 ?
[1:25:58] sava71: can someone explain to my bronze brain why leashing is bad (if you dont miss any xp)?

[1:27:52] 1kjuke: rengar still mad abt the no leash i bet
[1:28:03] scooterxoxo: @Jackspektra when I don't leash I don't know how to abuse it. Is it JUST to get lvl 2 prio? So I don't need to overhit minions? Just secure lvl 2?
[1:28:04] prabbyplayz: i despise katarina
[1:28:12] vox_canar1: IS HE DUO WITH RELL,
[1:28:14] ADL1337: @furios_live1 doesn't really matter, you can still get really good trades if you manage to isolate a 1v1 when you have lvl advantage
[1:28:16] prabbyplayz: why does she apply on hit on ult
[1:28:17] 1kjuke: vox_canar1 ye

[1:30:48] xcalebur: this doesnt look like lethality vayne with er
[1:30:53] clear117: typical senna in low elo
[1:31:41] shaavola: Typical senna in a league game vs an engage support
[1:31:50] Mbgz: does vayne double dip that passive? with stealth and dash during r?
[1:32:01] killua_zo1dyck_: is taking ghost puts you in disadvantage in lane ?

[1:33:28] EmperorSadge: There is this cursed build on vayne that you go Er into Yoummu/Hubris into Sundered Sky
[1:33:35] EmperorSadge: Every Q deals 700-1k dmg
[1:33:53] EmperorSadge: Stormrazor is better for constant dmg
[1:34:13] EmperorSadge: with sundered you only poke Q every 6s (4 with stacked ingenious)
[1:34:39] vox_canar1: 1K SHEEN
[1:34:59] Mbgz: why are you in low elo+

[1:36:02] EmperorSadge: Samira with that lead would triple there in split second. Crazy champion diff
[1:36:17] Allsido: it s easy to cancel dianna e with vayne e
[1:36:42] xcalebur: YOU HAVE A TEAM BUT THE MODS STILL GET NOTHING

[2:23:41] rockejj: @anthony_nkl i been watching saber coaching and good thing is adding something good to bad habit to make good good. for example to make better map awarness when you push you always wanna look at map and think where is jg
[2:23:42] faccboii: Well riot is considering bringing back duoq for masters

[2:24:49] rockejj: @Jackspektra what you think about not being able to see nicknames in lobby
[2:24:57] yeandhi: they could make it so duos are only matched against duos but then queue would be 40 minutes
[2:25:11] EmperorSadge: Remember when Upset was duo rushing to R1? @James_InJapan
[2:25:20] shaavola: Especially in a role where you are so dependant on the other player duoing it makes a yuuuuge diff

[2:25:54] James_InJapan: yeah but the game is already meh man. just let people play with their friends

[2:41:50] shaavola: It took 4 whole minutes
[2:42:16] peybol9: Hwei is a champ of league of legends
[2:42:22] CaptainSexylol: @Jackspektra ur support is a girl bro be nice :DDDDDD
[2:42:41] rejnes4: sup players classic
[2:42:41] daowill: who cares if she is a girl

[2:44:21] anthony_nkl: hwei is faker
[2:44:30] anthony_nkl: dodged everything
[2:44:36] steestt: !lvp
[2:44:56] sigiasd1: @Jackspektra Been really enjoying the youtube content you have been focusing on now.  I was very surprised you rated MF so low in your tierlist. She seems to be very powerful for a soloQ enviornment, maybe only in lower elo?
[2:45:06] shaavola: Karma for bullying lowelo.
[2:45:27] CaptainSexylol: its mental practise u got this
[2:45:37] tr1ption: is thos Gold 1?
[2:45:40] tr1ption: this*
[2:45:45] yolobarrel: @tr1ption d1 masters
[2:45:50] HerrWuschl: HerrWuschl subscribed with Prime. 
[2:45:51] FeomatarSG: (insert caedrel clip about adc) Kappa
[2:45:55] tr1ption: ok
[2:46:03] shaavola: G1 tier support however
[2:46:07] xsprehe: d2 to masters are in game
[2:46:32] xcalebur: lillia not really meta either
[2:46:42] xcalebur: mf more value when lillia is picked
[2:46:48] sigiasd1: Fair. In lower elo (around high emerald this eason mid dia last) currently everybody is picking engage supports what I have seen
[2:46:58] sigiasd1: @xcalebur Lilia is really high playrate winrate em+ tho
[2:47:11] rejnes4: huh
[2:47:12] tr1ption: gp Q?
[2:47:13] xcalebur: ive not seen her a single game
[2:47:16] Lucky_v9: nooooo
[2:47:30] Veselka__: good morning good sir
[2:47:40] rejnes4: why neko didnt help
[2:47:41] Lucky_v9: you are giving riot games some crazy ideas
[2:47:48] spentwalnut: buenos dias
[2:47:55] Veselka__: doesnt seem like it 😭
[2:47:56] Lucky_v9: imagine  a champ that has a mirror that reflects enemy abilities
[2:47:59] sigiasd1: @xcalebur currently on a 6.77 pick rate (9th highest jungler) with 53.02 winrate em+
[2:48:05] Lucky_v9: therefore you can shoot urself
[2:48:08] xcalebur: thats cool
[2:48:11] xcalebur: still never seen her tho
[2:48:26] Veselka__: !opgg
[2:48:31] steestt: when is disponible the new adc champ?
[2:48:37] CaptainSexylol: IN JACKSPEKTRA WE TRUST unless u play exh samira with resolve again to hurt my heart
[2:48:43] Mbgz: @Lucky_v9 they should make a champ that has abilities like in the game Portal. where you can send skillshots back to those casting them
[2:48:55] Glattli: what elo is this? lol
[2:48:59] spentwalnut: lol
[2:49:14] rejnes4: worse team than on smurf account
[2:49:20] sigiasd1: @Mbgz IIRC Bard og concept or zoe had this mechanic where they could move skill shots with their portals
[2:49:21] James_InJapan: keking
[2:49:47] FeomatarSG: you dont need doctor, for start you need to get out of this game
[2:49:51] Lucky_v9: nah but guys you didnt understand me
[2:49:57] afp_warden: what's the max order on Aphelios now¿ I've heard 4 points Q into max E into W is good
[2:50:10] sigiasd1: Least stressfull adc game
[2:50:17] Mbgz: ability to capture their skillshot and then you have 1-2 sec to fire it back i dont think real time sendback portal style could work
[2:50:43] Mbgz: -2
[2:50:49] Mbgz: AREYOUAGIRL
[2:50:52] James_InJapan: this ashe loves to ks then give gold away
[2:50:56] Lucky_v9: example : seraphine ults the new champ but the new champ spawns the mirror => seraphine r goes into the mirror and touches it => the seraphine r goes to seraphine charming her
[2:50:59] Lucky_v9: is that clear? XD
[2:51:31] sigiasd1: Hubris with the buff now feels really insane evne more so in high kills game
[2:51:36] inLogiex: it gives too few stacks per kill and 0 for assist for mejai miracle
[2:51:36] anthony_nkl: @Mbgz you could have a wall that reflects skillshots at the direction the wall is facing  (possibly an R)
[2:51:47] sigiasd1: Because you dont really loose anything if you die but kills still give you "stacks"
[2:52:05] Lucky_v9: @anthony_nkl ye just like that
[2:52:18] bh322x: !lvp
[2:52:37] inLogiex: 40% chance = 3 crits in a row
[2:52:44] James_InJapan: woth got hubris
[2:52:49] afp_warden: what's the max order on phel?
[2:53:29] Mbgz: looks like alt tab curse. re alt tab?
[2:54:23] sigiasd1: How you enjoying the more content focused life atm? After going to academy I saw you produce alot more content.
[2:55:20] sigiasd1: I mean even just from a personal brand points its a great idea. I am sure if/when you make it back to LEC your fanbase is increased from your content
[2:55:25] anthony_nkl: no idea why they didn't freeze bot wave since they were not contesting drake,  tempo for the lane swap maybe?
[2:56:13] MikuChan1998: collector
[2:56:30] spartalon117: When to go dark harvest and when to go fleet footwork
[2:56:30] anthony_nkl: isn't it collector to help you stack?
[2:56:32] portocaps: is my fav adc winning?
[2:56:39] Lucky_v9: collector ie rapid fire?
[2:57:11] sigiasd1: Collector/Oppertunity for damdge. Ghostblade for mobility. Crit is a  bit weaker if enemy has no tanks I would guess
[2:57:27] shaavola: Collector opportunity serylda rfc/bt
[2:58:05] potfriend166: draven is weak i think
[2:58:05] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr
[2:58:08] Lucky_v9: anyone knows how randuins work vs ashe?
[2:58:08] shade97485: what do u think about the strategy of adcs buying sup item?
[2:58:18] sigiasd1: @shade97485 very strong being removed next patch
[2:58:36] sigiasd1: @shade97485 if you want to abuse it this patch buy it first or 2nd back and get bloodsong
[2:58:48] shade97485: i think its gonna be used in lec next week
[2:58:59] sigiasd1: 100% it was used from T1 today in LCK
[2:59:16] imbior_: hey man would you recommend switching from attack move click to attack move? im used to playing with attack move click so i wonder if its worth the effort as all the streamers and pros seem to be using attack move
[2:59:46] greeniris_: 4444
[2:59:51] sigiasd1: Already on 31 AD from hubris
[2:59:53] sigiasd1: insane
[2:59:56] PanFuncio: WE WERE SO BACK
[2:59:57] portocaps: omg kinda clean
[3:00:08] portocaps: nvm yone is a champion
[3:00:12] Foonatic_: xdd
[3:00:20] SzorcPL: did he played gintx already?
[3:00:25] shade97485: is adc better to climb or should i swap to sup
[3:00:42] James_InJapan: bt last item?
[3:00:46] afp_warden: Terminus, the non-crit onhit ADC is abused by Yone, nice!
[3:00:51] sigiasd1: @shade97485 adc is the worst to climb but play your prefrence and improve at it.
[3:01:00] afp_warden: srsly, remove the crit scaling x2 crit on windshitters
[3:01:07] miniwoot33: GL today jack ❤️
[3:01:10] afp_warden: balance them as if they were Master Yi
[3:01:20] imbior_: alright thanks man I appreciate the advice
[3:01:50] shade97485: @sigiasd1 i cant win games on adc with 10+ kills
[3:01:52] portocaps: @miniwoot33 wait jack is a real pro ?
[3:02:06] spartalon117: When to go dark harvest and when to go fleet footwork?
[3:02:08] CaptainSexylol: told u mental practise easily winnable
[3:02:18] sigiasd1: @shade97485 I mean it really depends on a lot of factors. Adc is the hardest role to climb but you can still climb if you are better
[3:02:24] CaptainSexylol: @spartalon117 atm always go dark harvest with lethality items burst is way too good
[3:02:32] Potater2K: why cant they make so adc items have a penalty for melee champs?
[3:03:00] shade97485: @CaptainSexylol i played mf but the game ended when i died once in temafight
[3:03:06] xcalebur: oh shit the golden ratio
[3:03:06] portocaps: thoughts on the new dragon adc?
[3:03:18] CaptainSexylol: @shade97485 that means ur team was shit and u had to 1 vs 9 Happens bro XD
[3:03:37] miniwoot33: @portocaps he play lec last year
[3:03:41] spartalon117: @CaptainSexylol thx a lot!
[3:03:43] ivan_asgore: ohhh the quest between artist is active!
[3:03:55] shaavola: Kayle moment
[3:04:01] sigiasd1: neeko deliverd the hwei ulty
[3:04:01] shaavola: Wat in the name of fk
[3:04:05] Foonatic_: BatChest
[3:04:14] CaptainSexylol: @spartalon117 a brother in need is a brother indeed
[3:04:18] portocaps: the hydra belveth looks scary
[3:04:18] shaavola: U get 4.444 lethality if u get the quest
[3:04:19] xcalebur: do you know waht the golden ratio is jack
[3:04:33] CompassionateComrade: ashe the goat
[3:04:35] anthony_nkl: the ashe carry xD
[3:04:52] xcalebur: yes
[3:04:55] harthedir: math is so epic :D
[3:05:03] Eziog97: @shaavola insane, 4 thousand lethality Kappa

[3:05:23] James_InJapan: look at the stacks
[3:05:28] sigiasd1: idk buffed hubris seems complety insane too me. 41 ad already
[3:05:38] James_InJapan: statues for jhin are dope
[3:05:52] greeniris_: that Baron spawn is the best thing ever of the map changes
[3:06:01] greeniris_: and the fact that the music change as well
[3:06:09] sigiasd1: in lower elo games you almost always have a kill every 90 seconds so its almost 100% uptime
[3:06:21] portocaps: true but redside bot is criminal
[3:06:39] James_InJapan: the statues can perma stack into enemy base
[3:06:46] xcalebur: she doesnt have the baron buff
[3:06:49] xcalebur: its very obvious
[3:06:51] Jitonce: Another month being scammed and timeouted with consent
[3:07:08] sigiasd1: @James_InJapan they removed that. only 2 statues now that "grow"
[3:07:36] James_InJapan: ahh okay i just saw it on a taco video earlier
[3:07:41] shaavola: I remember a certain individual dying to a blue buff ganking him in the botlane
[3:07:54] xcalebur: why didnt u get a hubris stack for kayle death
[3:08:27] shaavola: 3s after damaging
[3:08:28] sigiasd1: @xcalebur you gotta damdge in the last 3 seconds not just get assist
[3:08:33] shaavola: Not on takedown
[3:08:34] xcalebur: i see
[3:10:06] ivan_asgore: flame fraven
[3:10:06] James_InJapan: ggs
[3:10:07] ivan_asgore: XD
[3:10:09] CompassionateComrade: neeko is duo with ashe btw
[3:10:10] imbastreamer1: KappaPenis
