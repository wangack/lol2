[0:29:29] SmileIronside: worst one so far in toplane
[0:29:31] ZeXXayy: but him being so garbage last season was such a turn off
[0:29:52] thanahtos: @Luis39091 are you joking hes so broken and hes been that way for awhile he doesnt even need a buff
[0:30:12] Luis39091: im not joking, i tried garen and hes horrendous
[0:30:21] JoJoStreamAdventures: i just want a new skin on briar so she gets a new splash art with them feet
[0:30:27] Luis39091: i,l,
[0:30:35] thanahtos: @Luis39091 then you dont know how to play him
[0:30:46] Luis39091: ok
[0:31:15] firefire21: Sett losing of his 2 core items sucks man. Miss gore aut0L
[0:31:33] Luis39091: sett feels better now, no joke
[0:31:49] JoJoStreamAdventures: @firefire21 yeah huge, gore gave you so much cdr and sustain
[0:31:55] JoJoStreamAdventures: but the next titanic
[0:32:04] JoJoStreamAdventures: is really good, i love it
[0:32:18] firefire21: Titanic is cool n all but without gore I find Sett losing a lot of vitality
[0:32:26] taha501: shouldn't yuumus be a stable now with mythic restriction gone
[0:32:50] JoJoStreamAdventures: @firefire21 true but you were hella slow
[0:32:56] ZeXXayy: how is sett's combo with the auto reset? @AutolykusLoL
[0:33:01] swoocer: Brand literally exploded
[0:33:08] JoJoStreamAdventures: now you can at least delete someone with titanic and with tri you get some movement
[0:33:50] firefire21: The ms is nice, I will say.
[0:34:19] infx___: wsg auto been a min
[0:34:23] infx___: hows the new season
[0:35:04] JoJoStreamAdventures: i feel if you have enough experience with sett these changes won't affect you too much. for me sett has always been about placement in teamfights and performing in them
[0:35:30] JoJoStreamAdventures: laning sometimes you win and sometimes you dont but teamfights is where you should pop
[0:36:39] JoJoStreamAdventures: i dont think i remember the last time i won with a pyke, its so useless
[0:37:02] firefire21: Tough

[0:37:23] taha501: @JoJoStreamAdventures see but the bruiser items lost a lot of hp due to nerfs and sett relly on his W in teamfights which lost power since it scales of hp so even his teamfight got nerfed
[0:37:36] taha501: add to that the MS nerfs on items

[0:38:31] JoJoStreamAdventures: @taha501 yeah, for me its mostly the CDR, i was so used to having more cdr and i had to adjust to that
[0:39:16] JoJoStreamAdventures: i play in high emerald low diamond and i still perform but tbh its because i place really well, otherwise yeah he got hurt from the changes for sure
[0:40:53] Akane3473: AINTNOWAY
[0:41:05] taha501: he cant outrun sonna tho even with E LUL
[0:42:16] taha501: what do you think abt yuumus second or third

[9:05:07] snowballseri: Just give Sett a MMA Skin
[9:05:26] snowballseri: GODFIST Sett
[9:05:42] imacrazydude21: they kinda have to give sett a god fist skin
[9:05:57] snowballseri: But it needs to include the Bunny girl that wants to chop your arm off if you dont kill those pesky demons
[9:06:04] sayanakae: God Fist reminds me of some Anime
[9:06:10] Kula__Diamond__: Godfist has the most potential

[9:08:31] snowballseri: @imacrazydude21 Kinda yes, but Dio is the better option as japanese VA for Sett is Dio's voice,
[9:08:59] snowballseri: The only reason to change the ingame voice to japanese
[9:09:11] snowballseri: And death moans aut0Smug
[9:09:42] snowballseri: Japanese people really are closet perverts with how over the top some of those sound.
