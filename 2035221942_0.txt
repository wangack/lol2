[2:21:30] noahtheknower: wp
[2:22:14] ssbm_worm: its on the ping wheel
[2:22:25] iiNumb3rz: whats the rengar one shot combo from a bush? i keep accidently using empowered W
[2:22:42] iiNumb3rz: Supposed to empower Q right?
[2:23:49] ssbm_worm: yea empowered Q does most dmg just look for rengar combo on youtube
[2:24:02] iiNumb3rz: i did but i think im doing it wrong
[2:24:11] iiNumb3rz: you click from bush E W Q Q right?
[2:24:21] ssbm_worm: it depends on ur ferocity
[2:24:28] ssbm_worm: jumping from a bush gives u 1 ferocity
[2:24:47] iiNumb3rz: well at 0 the jump e gives you one, then one for e, one for w, one for q, then empowered
[2:25:14] ssbm_worm: it depends on the situation right bc E has lower range than jump
[2:25:35] Dezrunner: niceu!
[2:25:56] madladzzzz: can we listen to crash CTR soundtrack on repeat nielonRace
[2:27:38] ssbm_worm: the hardest part of rengar imo is managing ferocity and not blowing CDs; oneshotting someone is the easy part lol
[2:28:21] vileb123: what do the stacks under belveth hp indicate?
[2:29:11] NeverWorse95: Passive stacks which gives AS
[2:29:41] ssbm_worm: should ur bot have rotated for u?
[2:29:45] ssbm_worm: ashe was low ig
[2:29:47] vileb123: ty
[2:29:47] Alberkahn: If E was up youd take rengar there
[2:30:43] Alberkahn: akali LUL
[2:31:25] baevermaas: is that sundering item thing good on belvussy? @santorin also this isnt Baever cause he left so you can do the WW only stream
[2:31:29] Alberkahn: Rengar shows up when Es down, clever girl LUL
[2:31:45] NeverWorse95: Wholesome machinically difficult Rengar play Pog
[2:32:04] RaiohKyros: how does the supp item exploit work
[2:32:12] Alberkahn: @baevermaas i doubt it, why get one heal when you just go lifesteal and heal of everything
[2:33:42] NeverWorse95: @RaiohKyros From what I've heard. ADC starts dorans. On first back at 5-7 min, buy support item. Use stacks on caster minions, support takes canon (must) and melee. Then enjoy free item and money
[2:33:47] Sonje: tibbers on drugs
[2:33:48] Zafer4848: annie : surprise
[2:34:00] NeverWorse95: DO NOT USE STACKS ON ENEMY
[2:34:39] NeverWorse95: That way you dodge support item cs penalty
[2:35:08] Alberkahn: stormsurge bard LUL i LOV EIT
[2:35:22] Sonje: psycho bard
[2:35:29] eliotxshadowfrost21: bard wants to play a game
[2:35:46] ssbm_worm: @NeverWorse95 you dodge the penalty by delaying the buy until first back?
[2:36:27] Sonje: nah, by not using it on enemy
[2:36:36] ssbm_worm: ooooo ok
[2:36:52] NeverWorse95: @ssbm_worm I believe so, not sure how that works. You might want to try it in a custom game first
[2:37:10] Chomfucjusz: what's the suppport item cs penalty?
[2:37:15] ssbm_worm: why do i always see it on double range?
[2:37:30] Alberkahn: its a penalty on support item cs Kappa
[2:37:54] NeverWorse95: Basically, if you CS too much with a support item you gain only 1 gold per CS
[2:38:07] NeverWorse95: Until the item is complete
[2:38:11] eliotxshadowfrost21: kled is just hyper feeding their team. this would have been a stomp if he just chilled top lane
[2:38:18] Sonje: yeah and you need to stay together or close in range to utilize the stacks, and with less coordination might get minion cut
[2:38:23] baevermaas: @santorin have you ever tried navoori on belveth? perma E
[2:38:25] NeverWorse95: Same applies to junglers
[2:38:28] Alberkahn: no one picks Kled to chill
[2:38:48] Alberkahn: Annie looking a lot like Bannie LUL
[2:40:17] getsometalentloser: riot will never admit support is overpowered
[2:40:31] eliotxshadowfrost21: kled got a kill! now hes ready to finally play the game 23 minutes in!
[2:40:53] NeverWorse95: Jungle too broken, buff adc/support! Top lane? what's that
[2:41:11] NeverWorse95: Riot probably
[2:41:23] Falcnation: they just need to give less gold for cs when the stacks are down and it'll be more balanced
[2:41:25] Alberkahn: Dont need to buff top lane, just buff Yorick Kappa
[2:41:33] eliotxshadowfrost21: akali saving ult to blow up annie for that bounty
[2:41:48] getsometalentloser: @Santorin look at rakan wr and janna name another role where champs with that wr for that long
[2:41:51] getsometalentloser: would not get nerfed
[2:42:06] eliotxshadowfrost21: yummy yummy bounty
[2:42:40] getsometalentloser: the bear procs malignence  constantly so ur get the alot of dmg and mr shreded
[2:43:07] Falcnation: enchanters being op makes being a blitz otp very nice lol
[2:43:15] Alberkahn: @Santorin Medics living the good life right now with support being stonks LUL
[2:43:16] getsometalentloser: @Falcnation they nerfed blitz
[2:43:20] getsometalentloser: before any opf them
[2:43:23] getsometalentloser: and they are next patch
[2:43:38] eliotxshadowfrost21: cries in senna seraphine bot lane. the ptsd
[2:44:23] Dsn19: You guys think Stromsurge is gonna get nerfed? xD
[2:44:32] Falcnation: 3 armor and 20% e ratio nerf isnt a big nerf for blitz tho
[2:44:37] Alberkahn: Wheres the old Taric x Yi combo Kappa
[2:44:54] eliotxshadowfrost21: music is too chill for the absolute destruction happening lol
[2:45:05] itsjimmmmmm: TOP GAP
[2:45:58] getsometalentloser: disgusting how op rengar is rn
[2:46:53] eliotxshadowfrost21: @santorin you and akali gonna need some painkillers for your backs after that game.
[2:46:56] baevermaas: hi this isn’t baevermaas cause he left and is never coming back. But I was just wondering if you would ever do that WW stream you spoke of or just atleast one game?
[2:46:59] BurritoTX: you need to add Tracy Chapman - Give Me One Reason to you list here. i think you will dig it.
[2:47:53] no_contrast: queue
[2:47:55] Dezrunner: Queue?
[2:48:00] baevermaas: this Lucas
[2:48:06] ARCHONtra: fast car is good
[2:48:14] Dezrunner: I'm the old one here, you're not supposed to develop mental issues at your age man
[2:48:16] eliotxshadowfrost21: brain.EXE has stopped working
[2:48:26] BurritoTX: your right fast car is a good one too.
[2:50:33] baevermaas: can we get a Warwick game anytime soon? feel like it’s been a while.
[2:51:17] Alberkahn: @Santorin If you ever have a Yorick, Garen or Sett in your top... it may be me ;)
[2:51:36] Dalfuric: synapse
[2:51:36] ARCHONtra: synapse
[2:52:00] baevermaas: it’s called T-pain War Pigs @santorin
[2:52:11] Dalfuric: full screen it
[2:52:16] Dalfuric: @baevermaas based
[2:52:16] BurritoTX: your welcome. it seemed like your vibes from the list i have heard.
[2:52:24] Alberkahn: LUL LUL LUL LUL ashe with the nuclear arrow
[2:52:43] Alberkahn: that was stormsurge on ashe wasnt it
[2:53:11] getsometalentloser: storm surge is getting nerfed again
[2:53:27] getsometalentloser: but  however broken ap items are distracting ppl  away from the broken ad items
[2:53:30] Alberkahn: Stormsurge, the mage equivalent of collector
[2:53:58] FroGGyWatchah: So when you playing Diana jungle?
[2:54:09] Dntspeedup: agreed
[2:54:20] Alberkahn: LUL what can you do but laugh
[2:54:35] mkramer2000: This is from the end of last season but lourlo had a crazy Nautilus game.
[2:54:42] mkramer2000: It was stupid
[2:54:48] Alberkahn: to be fair though pob was eatin taric autos while tarics castin so hes eating enhanced autos
[2:55:04] ssbm_worm: do they have ANY challenger players or ex-pros on the dev team??
[2:56:33] Alberkahn: Ardent meta? i member
[2:56:46] mkramer2000: It's the same with pro play and solo queue right? Something might be broken in solo queue but sucks in pro play
[2:56:46] FiveLetterNamee: have you noticed any changes to how you have to win games with the new season or is it just different champs are good now and thats it?
[2:56:59] NeverWorse95: Relic shield double assassin bot I member
[2:58:09] GideonBast: @santorin the best way this is done is to make supports powerful for the first 15-20 minutes. Then carries take over after they get 2-3 items
[2:58:20] Stakenaries: did u watch t1 vs geng earlier? was a pretty interesting series
[2:58:32] NeverWorse95: Sightstone -> mobi boots -> pholisopher stone -> wards and light up the entire map like christmas tree
[2:59:18] DemionDemon: @GideonBast and then Keria or some other filthy heretic will start playing carries as support again
[2:59:18] ssbm_worm: troo
[2:59:41] soux_ssb: caedALLO
[2:59:49] RaiohKyros: should pro meta should be play for top when red side then play for bot when blue
[2:59:54] GideonBast: slow the gold down for sure, the support item should be most of there power
[3:00:06] Stakenaries: in that series, one adc was like 30cs up and 1 plate up, the other was still up in gold with sp item
[3:00:08] RCStableSteven: so double mage botlane. notes.
[3:00:26] GideonBast: yeah playing a mage support feels so fun right now
[3:00:28] Alberkahn: Tickles me seeing swain 'support' and hes 3 items deep off the back of being 7/0 LUL
[3:00:39] RaiohKyros: so should pro meta be play for top when red side then play for bot when blue
[3:01:40] gigachadgodsu: Hello Papa Santorini! x34dayPew
[3:01:54] mkramer2000: Do you think that double support will be meta in pro play or just solo queue?
[3:02:09] worldparadise420: rumble full clear at 3:20...nice
