[0:08:59] jeskieKAT: :3
[0:09:12] neptunesxdl: it was a hotfix
[0:09:18] mercurial1o1: Micropatch
[0:09:21] neptunesxdl: oh today it was a maintenance
[0:09:33] neptunesxdl: im p sure today was a micro patch
[0:09:42] neptunesxdl: the micropatch shouldve happened few days ago
[0:09:53] neptunesxdl: yeah it's sundered sky
[0:09:55] jeskieKAT: NOTED
[0:10:09] neptunesxdl: i think it mightve been patched now
[0:10:16] neptunesxdl: since vandril made a video on it
[0:10:37] neptunesxdl: yeah but it's a pretty big bug so im unsure
[0:10:51] shamblesxmew: League is fun and addicting. 10 years in. I'm still bad but I won't let it go 🤣
[0:10:56] neptunesxdl: league wasn't broken for me a few hours ago
[0:11:13] neptunesxdl: nah riot does break the bugs that are actually game breaking tbf
[0:11:48] FrozenLavaReflector: I mean... notoriuously rengar is scripted so badly that there are decade long bugs that they still dont know how to fix for that champion
[0:11:49] neptunesxdl: fix*
[0:12:10] neptunesxdl: i mean it's a bug that allows u to one shot

[0:16:00] FrozenLavaReflector: Eclipse tytanic hull was before
[0:16:03] neptunesxdl: yeah u sacrifice health for better sustain and more dmg
[0:16:12] neptunesxdl: @FrozenLavaReflector yep
[0:16:33] neptunesxdl: trinity is a possible item but eclipse giving so much AD makes it kinda feel better
[0:16:54] Halofan642: flat ad is insane on fiora
[0:16:55] Halofan642: she loves flat ad
[0:17:14] neptunesxdl: oh right 5up i was mentioning to potent that u tried his build and he said he'd be down coaching u if u wanted to xD

[0:23:07] BluerBlack: @neptunesxdl Thats the job of the team to not let that happen
[0:23:13] IaCthulhuFthagn: No, you don't understand... sit behind the next tower.
[0:23:33] neptunesxdl: @BluerBlack yeah peel xD (team gets oneshotted by enemy gragas )

[3:40:07] p_s___: nami in the chat?  peepoHey
[3:40:19] Halofan642: ur supposed to focus on farming minions with the stacks before u hit the enemy
[3:40:26] Halofan642: cause if u hit enemy with stacks it ruins ur gold income inl ane
[3:40:31] Bvalltu: wait, what's happening with prime? I'm out of the loop
[3:41:01] zatyna_: do you really wanna be last hitting minions with sup item stacks?
[3:41:10] 9fierce9: Apperantly its getting removed Bvalltu
[3:41:20] zatyna_: nvm
[3:41:29] hughjanus9001: why 3 loll
[3:41:32] 9fierce9: 5up do you think HIgh noon senna is a good skin?
[3:41:36] Halofan642: yeah so the uspport item has a penalty on it where if you cs too much you dont get as much gold form minions
[3:41:38] divax0x0: @9fierce9 twitch prime?
[3:41:55] 9fierce9: yes according to 5up
[3:42:06] Halofan642: but the new support item is coded in a way that if your ally procs THEIR support item stack to give you the cs, it doenst count towards the income penalty
[3:42:10] Bvalltu: @9fierce9 Thanks! That's surprising
[3:42:21] divax0x0: Does twitch want to die
[3:42:21] Halofan642: @5up to ur question i think so, have ur support farm some if they dont have bounty ofc
[3:42:41] Halofan642: @derangedgorilla_ see how hes last hitting them and getting the ful +20 instead of +3? its because of the support item stack
[3:43:17] Halofan642: you should leave with her, no?
[3:43:24] Halofan642: you can just 5 man the grubs and dont lose much cause of supp item income
[3:43:24] wriju07: yo 5up, no morning lobby Among Us today?
[3:43:35] briweb11: no morning lobby today

[3:44:24] Tranced42: is this double supp item back in meta
[3:44:25] Halofan642: yteah using the stacks when poking basically ruins the strat
[3:44:37] divax0x0: No morning lobby but we get to see 5up rank up in league
[3:44:54] 9fierce9: @divax0x0, COPIUM
[3:45:22] divax0x0: @9fierce9 I'm trying to manifest it for our sanity
[3:45:35] Halofan642: @Tranced42 do you follow pro league? t1 played it today with lucian millio against aphelios lulu and the aphelios was up like 40 cs or something at one point and was barely up gold

[3:59:53] Halofan642: cause of penalty
[3:59:59] Tranced42: is he meant to be an artillery mage?
[4:00:00] Halofan642: ideally you let nami farm some but its hard for her to farm so
[4:00:38] Carnavious: your team can pressure baron at any point
[4:00:38] pureiinsanity: the penalty keeps alternating between on and off lol
[4:00:38] 420paul69: now shes never gonna walk up again
[4:00:45] 9fierce9: You almost 1 shot their Lillia for petes sake
[4:01:46] Halofan642: @pureiinsanity its based on how many minions you kill within the last 5 minutse iirc
[4:01:58] 9fierce9: YOURE 15/1
[4:02:03] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 yeah ik
[4:02:06] 9fierce9: I hate you lowkey om
[4:02:06] 420paul69: the only thing his kid doesnt have is a blink
[4:02:18] 420paul69: kit*
[4:02:29] pureiinsanity: when u have the gold for a whole item
[4:02:37] Halofan642: probably not until you get another full item
[4:02:40] greenzyy_: for rabadon i suppose
[4:02:44] Halofan642: but the wards are SOOO fucking op
[4:03:29] neicze: no among us today?
[4:03:31] 420paul69: trist does giga
[4:03:34] greenzyy_: or zhonays mby
[4:03:44] Halofan642: ur team is unaware that u are the carry
[4:03:46] Tranced42: hows hwei scaling?
[4:03:49] Halofan642: and is not peeling you
[4:04:16] mnbuckeye: Sell supp item for zhonyas?
[4:04:18] pureiinsanity: yep EQQQ
[4:04:37] lil__soupy: hi chat and 5up 5upWave
[4:04:54] 420paul69: o/
[4:06:05] milkis9098: omg i was watching a vod and didn’t realize you were live
[4:06:13] 420paul69: sell boots
[4:06:15] 420paul69: dcap
[4:06:24] 420paul69: or the death blossom thing
[4:06:31] Halofan642: mejais goes up to 145 ap if max stacks
[4:06:34] Halofan642: zhonyas gives 120
[4:06:46] Tranced42: idk if im just insane but mejais has always felt very underwhelming outside early-midgame
[4:06:47] milkis9098: 145 is WILD omg
[4:06:51] lilraeofsunshine14787: is there among us today?
[4:06:51] pureiinsanity: yeah but 5up started dieing so
[4:06:55] Halofan642: it seems like the ms is where the value of mejais is nowadays with how ap items give so much ap
[4:07:08] milkis9098: i love nami <3
[4:07:12] milkis9098: my first main
[4:07:16] Tranced42: thats like purely anecdotal from all the times ive gotten one to 25 then not felt very strong after a single death later
[4:07:29] FrozenLavaReflector: They are planning to buff hwei again in 14.2
[4:07:29] 420paul69: nice
[4:07:31] Halofan642: XD
[4:07:53] pureiinsanity: dude sneezed on you
[4:08:04] Karakadon: i think malignance proc on someone else?
[4:08:09] 9fierce9: No way your QE half healthed the Tristana
[4:08:12] milkis9098: nami also feels like such an underrated support to me sometimes. she has cc, peel, poke, heal, move speed boost, damage boost, like come on
[4:08:17] Halofan642: it mustve been malignance yeah
[4:08:18] Breadpool: press tab
[4:08:28] 420paul69: @milkis9098 nami is actually just hard to play
[4:08:28] milkis9098: wild
[4:08:30] 420paul69: no joke
[4:08:31] pureiinsanity: this wont be fair
[4:08:38] 1234ha34: No among us today?
[4:08:44] flyingpig100: Among us today?
[4:08:44] 420paul69: hard to play well
[4:08:47] 420paul69: ***
[4:09:04] milkis9098: @420paul69 oh yea for sure but i love her hehe
[4:09:08] wriju07: no amongus
[4:09:19] Carnavious: @milkis9098 all enchanters have most if not all of these traits i feel
[4:09:22] 420paul69: same, my fish sis was one of my peaking champs kaceyNails
[4:09:23] Breadpool: wait why do u have support item is this a tech
[4:09:31] literallygalio: @FrozenLavaReflector he needs buffs he isn't good atm
[4:09:36] Halofan642: oh lillia is angry
[4:10:04] pureiinsanity: riot knows balance
[4:10:05] fuz223: no among us today?
[4:10:11] flyingpig100: @wriju07 really?
[4:10:13] Breadpool: is doubble support item bot a thing?
[4:10:14] jeskieKAT: not5upClap not5upClap not5upClap
[4:10:16] sagois: om 󠀀
[4:10:21] wriju07: no amongus
[4:10:24] Halofan642: @Breadpool yes
[4:10:29] milkis9098: @carnavious yea i feel like she just doesn’t get a lot of love tho, maybe that’s just from what i’ve seen tho
[4:10:29] 9fierce9: Shes sarcastic, didnt you see their previous message om
[4:10:29] fuz223: ahh gotcha
[4:10:33] Breadpool: @Halofan642 why
[4:10:40] travsecure: not even S+
[4:10:40] nobadinohz: no honour for nami?
[4:10:45] milkis9098: hehe more league content
[4:10:49] Breadpool: i feel like eventually you have to sell that thing, it only gives mana and hp
[4:10:55] Breadpool: regen
[4:10:57] Breadpool: not even flat
[4:11:00] pureiinsanity: @5up plat support item on ADC's too Bloodsong is broken too
[4:11:00] wriju07: time to test it again? @5up
[4:11:04] Tranced42: holy 50 chests
[4:11:05] pureiinsanity: play*
[4:11:09] Halofan642: @Breadpool the item is really strong now with the upgrades it gives, especially bloodsong. it gives gp/5, it shares gold with your support, it igves 4 wards for u to use which is insane in higher elos
[4:11:13] xlaneswitch: Ggs -Nami
[4:11:19] xlaneswitch: My E was dealing 150 extra dmg
[4:11:20] milkis9098: omg almost m7
[4:11:25] xlaneswitch: per tick
[4:11:28] AwesomeTree: i have so many keys and no chests
[4:11:35] 420paul69: i use all my event coins to buy keys
[4:11:38] reallycrazypizzaman: You, Ant, and Hbomb, trio back in an event is hype.
[4:11:45] milkis9098: @xlaneswitch 5upL
[4:11:51] xlaneswitch: Its bc you now have double amping abilities
[4:11:52] Tranced42: nami mage botlanes have always been rly fun
[4:12:00] milkis9098: fellow nami players unite!
[4:12:05] 9fierce9: 53k damage is stupid
[4:12:06] mcnightmare91: no among us today?
[4:12:11] Breadpool: it would be interesting whenever they revert the changes so you can see the dmg other items do, i agree that its strong early but eventually you will hit a much higher dmg cap with another ap item or if you need a really strong flex item like zhonyas
[4:12:13] xlaneswitch: + mandate after u proc with my E
[4:12:20] Halofan642: for example, bloodsong is just a flat 12/8% dmgincrease depending on if the person is melee/ranged proccing it, which is fucking insane, on top of being a sheen proc
[4:12:22] Breadpool: this is my first time witnessing the double support item, so im just surprised tbh
[4:12:22] wriju07: no amongus
[4:12:27] milkis9098: @mcnightmare91 nope, lots of people out of town
[4:12:39] greenzyy_: !rank
[4:12:40] Fossabot: D4 (peak: Challenger) | https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/5up?hl=en_US (!ranks for other)
[4:12:43] pureiinsanity: @5up use support item on adc's too
[4:12:45] Halofan642: celestial opposition is a flat 25% dmg reduction on you as well
[4:12:51] Halofan642: the support items are just way to strong on top of everything else
[4:13:12] Breadpool: @Halofan642 yeah, i know what they all do - their passive abilities have to be strong because they dont actually have any stats on them themselves
[4:13:18] xlaneswitch: well goodluck on your games and other supports :)
[4:13:19] twtrok: mods are asleep, go wild chat
[4:13:26] Breadpool: thats my gripe with it
[4:13:34] Breadpool: eventually another item will outscale it past mid game
[4:13:38] Halofan642: i mean it was played in pro today
[4:13:38] Breadpool: that's my 2cents tho
[4:13:42] Halofan642: by the reigning world champs
[4:13:50] pureiinsanity: yeah the moment i saw how dumb this is and the more i thought about it the dumber it looked this is not ok

[4:16:05] casey_is_a_person: @wriju07 oh no
[4:16:06] Breadpool: @Halofan642 my argument would be that the stats you miss do not make it the value of a 2xxx gold item, it is probably more like 30% the strength of it (but because you get the passive of the strong items, you notice it and it feels stronger) but you miss other stats that that item would hold. bloodsong compared to the other sheen items are missing hp, cdr, ap, as, move speed or ad for example (and a lot of it)
[4:16:08] wriju07: no among us today

[4:54:18] PoteetLee: @tsantero Exactly.
[4:54:22] PoteetLee: No.
[4:54:37] madelynn__hm: @PoteetLee yeah he changed it to make fun of the situation
[4:54:40] balletbunny: this old man
[4:54:41] PoteetLee: Oh ok.
[4:54:47] PoteetLee: So he's not the real mr watermelon.

[4:55:03] PoteetLee: I about passed out.
[4:55:06] tsantero: i am confuse
[4:55:10] madelynn__hm: he was some random guy that Steve and Baycon keep playing with/against in valo
[4:55:16] Kizmetti: janet said something ab this dude named ‘mr watermelon’ who just follows steve in every game ever
[4:55:41] Halofan642: eyeball gives 30 ap
[4:55:50] PoteetLee: Just some random person steve is convinced was stream sniping for awhile because they always queued with or against him. On his team, mr watermelon was dogshit but playing against he was godlike.
[4:55:59] lilrexuwu: mr watermelon, alleged  valo stream sniper. steve fears him
[4:56:07] Halofan642: it depends how often u can proc it in lane as well as how spread out your abilities that proc it are
[4:56:39] PoteetLee: Whoa man.
[4:56:40] Joker_GGEZ: excuse me?
[4:56:43] PoteetLee: Kind of rude.
[4:56:45] Superphreakk: slander
[4:56:46] PoteetLee: KIND OF RUDE
[4:56:52] balletbunny: go to hell

[5:00:19] tsantero: whats a burrito, i'm culinarily challenged
[5:00:22] Joker_GGEZ: LMAO ily phreak /p dwdw
[5:00:32] Joker_GGEZ: right tsantero?
[5:00:42] Superphreakk: is a burrito like cereal?
[5:00:44] Halofan642: hi joker 👋
[5:00:46] Superphreakk: cuz thats all i eat
[5:00:53] Joker_GGEZ: HALO <3
[5:01:09] Joker_GGEZ: that makes sense considering your food takes
[5:01:09] lil__soupy: i have never heard of this "burrito" you speak of
[5:01:13] lil__soupy: tell me more pls
[5:01:28] tsantero: chat, i just googled it. apparently a burrito is a type of sandwich
[5:01:41] nnacro: what
[5:01:44] Joker_GGEZ: 5up deserves every bit of sass he's getting rn by the way i didn't send him that coffee shop for this slander
[5:01:49] lil__soupy: we don't need more sandwiches in the world
[5:01:49] Superphreakk: ooooh sandwich, i think ive heard of those before
[5:01:56] balletbunny: whats a sandwich
[5:01:57] Superphreakk: thats with like... bread right?
[5:01:58] BluerBlack: The word burrito means "little donkey" in Spanish, the diminutive form of burro, or "donkey".
[5:02:01] blazin_barbie: how has the last hour been with games
[5:02:04] Joker_GGEZ: is a sandwich like a soup?
[5:02:05] tsantero: yeah, one of the three food categories. sandwich, soup, and salad.
[5:02:05] blazin_barbie: yay or nay
[5:02:14] Superphreakk: salad?
[5:02:29] lil__soupy: @tsantero have i been summoned?
[5:02:33] Halofan642: yeah man ur playing for laning phase with double support item i think
[5:02:35] tsantero: KEKW
[5:02:39] lil__soupy: why are you guys saying my name
[5:02:46] Joker_GGEZ: im gonna add a fourth category tsantero
[5:02:47] jeskieKAT: 5upSoup
[5:02:48] Joker_GGEZ: which is ravioli
[5:02:48] Fossabot: 5upSoup 5upSoup 5upSoup
[5:03:00] tsantero: ravioli are sandwiches in soup
[5:03:17] Halofan642: no i dont think so
[5:03:19] Joker_GGEZ: ok i gotta go break into some corporations back to lurking chat
[5:03:24] Halofan642: if ur question is when u proic the stack
[5:03:35] lil__soupy: i have no sandwiches in me tho
[5:03:50] Hayase64: I think not
[5:03:52] lil__soupy: i have never heard of "soup" outside of my name
[5:04:00] Halofan642: "Quest's execute against minions counts as a minion kill for the allied champion that was granted the kill gold." from wiki
[5:04:21] Halofan642: so it counts towards the cs penalty but you still get full income from it if im understanding right
[5:04:30] Halofan642: supp item on first back is definitely better
[5:04:41] Halofan642: thats all ive seen so far, and thats what t1 did today as well
[5:04:54] Halofan642: u just need the stats from dorans item imo
[5:05:40] Halofan642: i know cupic was waiting until 800 gold to back for tear+supp item on seraphine
[5:05:48] Halofan642: and cupic took tp but that might be seraphine specific
[5:07:13] Hayase64: Earlier there was the T1 game where Gumayusi lost a wave and Peyz got plates, but Guma was still ahead in gold
[5:08:16] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[5:10:33] piveel: did you loose the last game with tahm supp?
[5:10:53] Halofan642: ye he lost tham supp game
[5:11:08] piveel: rip
[5:11:23] 9fierce9: Nice Ult om
[5:12:06] BluerBlack: om
[5:13:02] Halofan642: it made it thru cause there was no preseason
[5:13:04] Tranced42: isnt this just double relic shield meta except its also a ludens
[5:13:20] Halofan642: @Tranced42 or its also a free pta/sheen proc

[5:20:44] padfootly: 5upBlind
[5:21:44] TayTayPerseus: wrong tay i should change my name lol
[5:22:02] pureiinsanity: @5up did u know ingenious reduces trinket CD

[5:22:22] TayTayPerseus: that poor lb lmao
[5:23:40] minismile_: hi i am back
[5:24:02] PoteetLee: Hello mini.
[5:24:09] Blisdon_: Hii
[5:24:13] minismile_: hi poteet
[5:24:18] minismile_: i zoned out and forgot abt the stream
[5:24:24] piveel: meow
[5:24:25] minismile_: and ive been doing literally nothing for hours
[5:24:47] minismile_: i will literally never understand this game in my life
[5:25:10] Tranced42: u push some buttons and stuff happens and then u win or lose :]
[5:25:27] PoteetLee: @minismile_ Me all the time.
[5:25:34] minismile_: literally never 5up i kid you not
[5:25:41] minismile_: @Tranced42 thank u for this explanation fr
[5:25:45] minismile_: sums it up perfectly i finally get it
[5:25:46] pureiinsanity: @5up trinkets get reduced CD from ingenious
[5:25:48] PoteetLee: @minismile_ Literally me...as I'm wearing my T1 hoodie.
[5:25:56] minismile_: you think too highyl of me
[5:25:56] pureiinsanity: also the tooltip is wrong cuz ingenious
[5:26:07] padfootly: i think this game is easy to watch but there's a lot of peer pressure to play well
[5:26:13] minismile_: thats also true i have not tried
[5:26:16] solomonlear: Honestly it is more the community toxicity that draws me away from it.
[5:26:21] Seiris: Simple to pick up, but hard to master
[5:26:22] briweb11: I hate that I understand it now
[5:26:28] piveel: I agree with that
[5:26:29] solomonlear: If I wanted to be screamed at, i would go to work an extra shift.
[5:26:33] minismile_: but one of my closest friends is league obsessed like he plays every single day and tries to get me to learn
[5:26:53] PoteetLee: mini remains strong.
[5:27:03] solomonlear: I enjoy it, not the people. so I watch other people play. Leave when I see them get toxic.
[5:27:04] Wolfman1359: Was there no amongus lobby today? ReeferSad
[5:27:04] Evuszka: mini give in
[5:27:05] minismile_: @solomonlear thats also fair, ive seen a lot of toxicity related to that whole thing so its understandable
[5:27:05] briweb11: @solomonlear mood
[5:27:16] minismile_: @Wolfman1359 not happening today no
[5:27:24] minismile_: @Evuszka im strong like poteet said
[5:27:29] Tranced42: 5up wat r ur opinions on whether or not league should have voice chat
[5:27:35] minismile_: god's strongest soldier (has not played league yet)
[5:27:37] Evuszka: leeg is fun if you play with friends
[5:27:43] solomonlear: Haha pretty much. Long as the streamer is chill tho, I listen to them while I work.
[5:27:49] NemoB90: that was a chase and a half lol
[5:27:50] PoteetLee: mini said "I'm too mentally well to play" And honestly, that's respectable.
[5:27:56] solomonlear: And give them a new way to yell at you, madness
[5:27:58] minismile_: @PoteetLee HELP
[5:28:02] minismile_: do we still have help
[5:28:04] minismile_: !help
[5:28:04] Fossabot: @minismile_ Channel commands are available at: https://fossabot.com/5up/commands
[5:28:06] piveel: I’m glad a picked league last spring now I’m always looking forward to every 5s stream
[5:28:06] minismile_: oh
[5:28:07] Tranced42: yeah its crazy how this is the one competitive game still alive in this age that doesnt have a vc
[5:28:09] PoteetLee: HFIEOW
[5:28:09] minismile_: wait what is it
[5:28:11] minismile_: like the HJKFASJFKAS
[5:28:12] minismile_: HASJIRKJASFKASJF
[5:28:14] minismile_: LIKE THE
[5:28:16] minismile_: HELP COMMAND
[5:28:17] minismile_: "helpme
[5:28:17] Fossabot: "HELP" is the warcry of 5up's moderators. If any of them use any variation of "help" or "help me", please proceed to find them emergency assistance.
[5:28:19] minismile_: !helpme
[5:28:19] Fossabot: "HELP" is the warcry of 5up's moderators. If any of them use any variation of "help" or "help me", please proceed to find them emergency assistance.
[5:28:21] minismile_: oh
[5:28:23] minismile_: okay yes
[5:28:25] minismile_: HELP
[5:28:30] PoteetLee: Oh mini.
[5:28:34] minismile_: please
[5:28:36] minismile_: enough
[5:28:37] squatgains: The amount of toxicity they would have to control if League had VC
[5:28:38] PoteetLee: Maybe I spoke too soon about being mentally well.
[5:28:41] minismile_: STOP
[5:28:43] minismile_: yeah
[5:28:44] Evuszka: D:
[5:28:53] pureiinsanity: lul
[5:28:57] minismile_: thats for sure true correct
[5:28:59] Tranced42: i am of the opinion that toxicity would actually go down with a voice chat being added
[5:29:01] Halofan642: @solomonlear i think the lack of vc makes it easy for ppl to forget their are humans playing the game
[5:29:11] Halofan642: without vc its just npcs
[5:29:13] jeskieKAT: !quote
[5:29:13] Tranced42: after the initial barrier of people not wanting to join because of text toxicity stigma
[5:29:14] Fossabot: @jeskieKAT #19: "OH MY GOD THIS BARD IS SEXY! HOLY MOLY!" - 5up, Sept 13th, 2023
[5:29:17] briweb11: @squatgains people are cowards when you can actually talk to people the majority of people wouldn’t be bad
[5:29:25] Halofan642: most people are too scared to be toxic when they can be confronted
[5:29:29] Halofan642: imo
[5:29:32] BluerBlack: Oh no
[5:29:36] BluerBlack: please no voide
[5:29:39] Tranced42: oh yeah i forgot about europe
[5:29:40] TayTayPerseus: it works in valo in euw
[5:29:42] Superphreakk: the truth of the matter, is games that are easily just as toxic as league like dota, have VC. It can be done, they just dont wanna do it.
[5:29:44] pureiinsanity: is comet better than aery thought it was not
[5:29:45] TayTayPerseus: just talk english
[5:29:47] BluerBlack: I dont want to hear Russian scream all the time
[5:29:48] solomonlear: Maybe, I have been screamed at in WOW chats in my own guild
[5:29:49] BluerBlack: KEKW
[5:29:52] Seiris: In Europe most of us speak english to some degree though
[5:30:01] Sol_Bebe: in cs2 there’s still voice comms and Europe is the best region even with the language gaps
[5:30:02] pureiinsanity: !rank
[5:30:02] Fossabot: D4 (peak: Challenger) | https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/5up?hl=en_US (!ranks for other)
[5:30:04] piveel: it’s not that big of a problem like csgo is a thing valorant is a thing they both have a vc and most ppl talk in english
[5:30:06] Evuszka: in valorant voice chat works normally in europe so
[5:30:09] zatyna_: EUNE gonna become an actual nightmare to play on
[5:30:11] NemoB90: most europeans know english well enough to communicate
[5:30:18] Superphreakk: In europe if you watch european streams, everyone speaks english unless in Russia, in which most of the time they speak russian
[5:30:22] pureiinsanity: true
[5:30:25] pureiinsanity: always listen to me
[5:30:28] TayTayPerseus: ok guys secret to valo eu is queue on LOndon server LUL no russian there
[5:30:33] pureiinsanity: u should build support items on adc's too
[5:30:36] Seiris: @NemoB90 even if we can't communicate, we recognise champ names and lane names
[5:30:45] minismile_: i have been learning english since i was like 2
[5:30:59] pureiinsanity: yeah
[5:31:08] Hayase64: Janna otp is ez climb, I heard
[5:31:09] pureiinsanity: yep
[5:31:19] Tranced42: there have been so many games of league that i remember clearly thinking "if i could have voice commed for something in that fight we win that game" and it just makes it feel so not competitive
[5:31:19] kkHarvy: kkHarvy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! wassup
[5:31:20] Evuszka: @Superphreakk russia has seperate server in league
[5:31:40] minismile_: i jus agree with u 5up bc i have no idea whats going on but u play this a lot so u gotta have some idea abt what good what bad
[5:31:40] Tranced42: especially as kat when i have people on my team i can use as shunpo targets
[5:31:43] Superphreakk: pretty much same with Dota
[5:31:50] minismile_: mar my friend 5up my league sources
[5:32:15] solomonlear: I find voice chat can be helpful, but only when in a trusted group
[5:32:17] pureiinsanity: @5up btw u stoped running Aery on hwei?
[5:32:19] BluerBlack: jax getting banned Sadge
[5:32:47] minismile_: whos that
[5:32:51] minismile_: the person on screen rn
[5:32:51] Evuszka: wait i just realized u play hwei bot
[5:32:53] minismile_: thats my friends pfp
[5:32:59] minismile_: the one that plays league
[5:32:59] Superphreakk: Dota gets real toxic for sure with VC, but at the same time, people understand that if they abuse it they are getting banned. It will most certainly make "some" games more toxic, but if its moderated well it can be managed.
[5:33:08] Tranced42: @minismile_ hwei?
[5:33:14] minismile_: yes i see the name
[5:33:20] Tranced42: hes the new twink everyone is obsessed with
[5:33:21] minismile_: eats....
[5:33:30] minismile_: @Tranced42 STOP this is literally exactly what my friend said
[5:33:37] minismile_: he looks good
[5:33:40] Evuszka: mini, you should start playing league exclusively for hwei
[5:33:40] Tranced42: 😭 all of leaguetwt said that
[5:33:43] Evuszka: ^-^
[5:33:46] minismile_: @Evuszka stopp
[5:33:49] Seiris: @Superphreakk Thats the issue then, riot don't want to actually moderate anything with humans anymore, same reason in game chat is getting screwed.
[5:34:04] minismile_: ouuu wait
[5:34:05] Superphreakk: The ONE caveat i have with VC on league, is that its a WAY bigger streamed game. Which means trolling streamers will be very easy, and saying absolutely heinous stuff just for the luls of having it heard on stream, is definitely a concern.
[5:34:05] minismile_: i see it
[5:34:07] Tranced42: i can see it
[5:34:07] pureiinsanity: yep
[5:34:07] balletbunny: emo artist YesYes
[5:34:08] AwesomeTree: you are hwei though

[5:34:29] pureiinsanity: even the jhin obsession
[5:34:36] hoshiNstar: Next dubath9n reward hwei cosplay
[5:34:38] Evuszka: thats a crazy comparison to me lookwise

[5:50:19] ameliaaaaa_2738: Mini it's an okay song but not one of my favs from her
[5:50:23] blazin_barbie: I haven’t heard her new song yet
[5:50:33] minismile_: @balletbunny im crying is it fantasize
[5:50:35] ameliaaaaa_2738: Hoping that I enjoy the album more
[5:50:43] balletbunny: @minismile_ yess she needs to release that omg
[5:50:45] Superphreakk: i have no idea how i missed it, but i very recently found out there is a Wicked movie coming out this year
[5:50:53] Superphreakk: and Ariana is in it as Glinda
[5:50:59] minismile_: @blazin_barbie omg its so good u should listen esp if u like house
[5:51:15] ameliaaaaa_2738: Mini if u need someone to talk to about ari, there's joker
[5:51:19] minismile_: @balletbunny its good but she has better songs i also doubt she gonna release it afater it leaked so bad
[5:51:28] minismile_: @ameliaaaaa_2738 oh trust me i know..
[5:51:30] Superphreakk: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana as Elphaba and Glinda sounds so potentially goated to me
[5:51:36] blazin_barbie: I’ll listen today
[5:51:37] balletbunny: noooo peepoSad
[5:51:56] minismile_: @Superphreakk its definitely goated also goated is such a funny word to use about them and like wicked in general
[5:52:06] minismile_: @blazin_barbie yes lmk what u think please
[5:52:10] Superphreakk: haha, i cannot help my upbringing
[5:52:14] Superphreakk: twitch did this to me
[5:52:21] minismile_: one thing joker is good at is supporting blonde female singers

[5:52:29] Airshredder: heyo, how things going, too much snow coming down for me to go into work today, and can't work from home
[5:52:39] blazin_barbie: lmao
[5:52:56] minismile_: @Airshredder omg is it llike nice snow or is it annoying and cold and bad
[5:52:57] Superphreakk: the whole cast sounds like it could be really good, I really only know Jonathon Bailey from FFXIV and broadchurch
[5:53:06] GandorTheGreat: Cos voidlinks
[5:53:13] minismile_: @Superphreakk yeahh the cast so good im very excited
[5:53:14] AkitaAttribute: If you have a split pusher, I feel like you just lose if they get 6
[5:53:17] Halofan642: the damage is insane
[5:53:22] minismile_: glad ari has an album coming tho ive missed her bad
[5:53:29] Halofan642: @AkitaAttribute i feel like even 4 is really good on a melee champ
[5:53:36] laissi_: true dmg increase on towers i think
[5:53:48] nasssoum: no among us today ?
[5:53:53] AkitaAttribute: Yeah but once you have the grubs spawning it's crazy
[5:54:00] laissi_: @nasssoum no
[5:54:02] minismile_: @nasssoum nope
[5:54:02] Superphreakk: Im only slightly worried that they are gonna make it Ariana as Glinda, and not Ariana playing Glinda
[5:54:06] Airshredder: @minismile_ no idea, but enough that none of my shift feel safe enough going in, especially with the freezing rain that happened last night
[5:54:10] blazin_barbie: has the album released then or not yet
[5:54:17] nasssoum: :( @minismile_ do we know why
[5:54:18] ameliaaaaa_2738: @minismile_ Jokers geography skills are a mystery to me....
[5:54:27] ouranhshc: omgHmm
[5:54:27] minismile_: @minismile_ oh god okay stay safe have a fun inside day
[5:54:28] clyfen_: what is that item in 2nd slot
[5:54:30] Superphreakk: but i trust the people making it to not go too far with the pop influence
[5:54:30] piveel: sup ruined the push
[5:54:34] minismile_: @minismile_ i still think he was baiting
[5:54:39] clyfen_: o o
[5:54:45] ameliaaaaa_2738: @nasssoum Lots of peeps are busy Sadge
[5:54:48] piveel: literally wrecked the herald and didn’t do no dmg to turret

[5:54:59] nasssoum: sadge
[5:55:05] balletbunny: this is not antfrost level renata SMH
[5:55:12] ameliaaaaa_2738: @minismile_ I legit can't wrap my head around iy
[5:55:14] Hayase64: I saw what a Lucien bloodsong could do
[5:55:22] Superphreakk: Yeah, as long as they stay "mostly" true to the source material with her, im totally find with her doing her own take on the role
[5:55:44] minismile_: i didnt even try to think abt it amelia i just assumed he was kidding baiting farming interactions and moved on with my day
[5:55:45] blazin_barbie: is it a movie or a broadway
[5:55:45] Superphreakk: if Glinda be doin runs every song though... it might get too much
[5:55:53] minismile_: i did call him dumb though so
[5:56:38] minismile_: @Superphreakk i think it should be fine i understand this but like my own personal take is that i wont really care what she ends up being like bc i love ari so i dont rly mind anything
[5:56:59] minismile_: like i wouldnt care if they literally made up a new character or something
[5:57:05] clyfen_: so that ability is like karth q
[5:57:06] minismile_: but i understand the like
[5:57:08] minismile_: slight concern
[5:57:22] clyfen_: u said if only he was isolated

[5:58:43] pureiinsanity: its Brand W
[5:58:55] Superphreakk: yeah, i think i will like it cuz i like Araiana, i'm just worried about the Broadwayphiles who want nothing but source material. I want to enjoy it but i also want the movie to do well so we might get more big budget broadway movies
[5:59:00] Superphreakk: since Cats was such a disaster
[5:59:14] Halofan642: i mnean this champ was designed to be complexd

[6:35:06] cyberlapse: hwei is a fun champion
[6:35:20] Airshredder: so what exactly causes the respawn timer to increase?
[6:35:25] Superphreakk: im an odd mixture of a human being
[6:35:30] AwesomeTree: @Airshredder level
[6:35:32] Senz: that vamp bozo got owned
[6:35:34] zatyna_: @Airshredder level
[6:35:39] xthe_spacemanx: @airshredder champ level
[6:35:43] AwesomeTree: higher the level, longer the timer
[6:35:45] Halofan642: @AirSharks  level AND game time
[6:36:20] Joker_GGEZ: i feel like livestreaming just inherently isnt profitable and the reason kick gets away w/ it is because of yknow
[6:36:23] itsUnsmart: Storage is just about the cheapest resource for hosting stuff. The most expensive thing is going to be bandwidth by miles.
[6:36:29] Joker_GGEZ: but livestreaming is just never gonna be profitable if it's as accessible as it is now
[6:36:33] Joker_GGEZ: yeah
[6:36:40] Joker_GGEZ: unsmart are you also cs background
[6:36:52] itsUnsmart: I am a software engineer :)
[6:37:07] Joker_GGEZ: omg handshake emoji
[6:37:12] Joker_GGEZ: i'm trying to break into infosec
[6:37:33] minismile_: i judging SE so bad in my uni bc they dont have physics so their major easier
[6:37:41] Halofan642: people livestreaming on the livestreaming site

[6:40:04] Joker_GGEZ: felt that
[6:40:12] Joker_GGEZ: phreak ive gone through so much drama in the past month btw
[6:40:15] Joker_GGEZ: its wild
[6:40:17] itsUnsmart: I feel like the only solution to Twitch revenue problems would be to actually work with companies as a middleman to sponsor streamers tbh. And not just displaying ads on the streams but actually working directly with creators
[6:40:19] Superphreakk: oh...
[6:40:24] Superphreakk: well fuck.... im sorry
[6:40:25] Joker_GGEZ: joker lore book doubled in size off of the past four months alone
[6:40:35] Joker_GGEZ: naw dw its all good
[6:40:37] Superphreakk: i'll stop the shit talk then
[6:40:37] Joker_GGEZ: im here for the ride
[6:40:57] Superphreakk: I wanna be JUST annoying enough so you will never forget to listen to it
[6:41:08] Joker_GGEZ: @itsUnsmart what do you think about twitch working directly w/ game studios to promote new releases and earning some rev that way
[6:41:12] Joker_GGEZ: phreak im not annoyed at all dw LMAO
[6:41:18] Joker_GGEZ: it's so hard to get on my nerves
[6:41:30] Joker_GGEZ: if anything the shittalk is making me giggle :p
[6:41:30] itsUnsmart: Thats exactly the type of thing I am talking about yeah @Joker_GGEZ
[6:41:57] Joker_GGEZ: twitch should hire us
[6:42:04] Joker_GGEZ: get us out of our miserable lives :(
[6:42:06] AwesomeTree: why is the cherry vanilla coke so bad
[6:42:10] Joker_GGEZ: and give us big bucks and power
[6:42:12] Superphreakk: ok good bitch, THEN FUCKIN LISTEN TO IT

[6:42:18] blazin_barbie: no literally
[6:42:19] itsUnsmart: Thats pretty much what my company does right now lol but we dont work with game studios at least havent had any yet LUL
[6:42:23] minismile_: im like a profeesisioanl annyogin person
[6:42:24] Joker_GGEZ: LMAOOO phreak
[6:42:54] minismile_: okay ill try to sleep but im lurking for now
[6:42:57] minismile_: until i pass out
[6:42:58] minismile_: goodnight
[6:43:01] Superphreakk: im just excited, the 3rd act he put out was so good, and the 4th act is coming out in february
[6:43:04] Joker_GGEZ: gn mini!
[6:43:07] Superphreakk: which is MUCH faster than the last couple
[6:43:11] Joker_GGEZ: game studios are either really fun or just bad
[6:43:17] Joker_GGEZ: is the 4th act the final one phreak?
[6:43:20] itsUnsmart: Twitch has a lot more valuable data that companies like to know that would easily drive up the price of any contracts though
[6:43:22] Superphreakk: so im excited that maybe we'll get stuff quicker now
[6:43:23] AwesomeTree: wait whats that senna build
[6:43:25] Superphreakk: NOOOOOOOOOOO
[6:43:28] Superphreakk: not even kind of close
[6:43:38] Joker_GGEZ: damn LMAO
[6:43:39] Superphreakk: I think he projected like 15 or something
[6:43:43] Joker_GGEZ: yeah no twitch's biggest asset is definitely its user data unsmart
[6:43:46] Superphreakk: 4th act is only up to Circe
[6:43:47] Joker_GGEZ: you're fully right
[6:43:48] Halofan642: no .... seraphine...
[6:43:56] Joker_GGEZ: like the budget game studios would pop on that sort of information is wild
[6:44:04] Joker_GGEZ: oh damn phreak
[6:44:15] Halofan642: ashe is casually playing the best supp in the game btw XD
[6:44:18] dominosu_: that ashe is so mad
[6:44:53] Superphreakk: poseidon act was so good though
[6:45:02] Superphreakk: the guy he got to play poseidon has such a good voice
[6:45:18] Pizza19191: vlad is a bot LUL
[6:45:29] Joker_GGEZ: good voices make me feel some sort of way so that's very enticing
[6:45:38] Joker_GGEZ: zagreus in hades..
[6:46:11] Superphreakk: zag has such a good voice, but it still kills me how that guy does so many voices in that game
[6:46:16] Superphreakk: and they are all so fuckin different
[6:46:46] Joker_GGEZ: voice actors deserve more recognition
[6:46:50] Joker_GGEZ: they're so incredibly talented
[6:47:22] Superphreakk: Im really glad studios seem to be focusing more on spending money on VA's
[6:47:54] lil__soupy: omg i forgot to watch the new pjo episode

[6:49:41] AkitaAttribute: Idk, I feel like he is less complicated than Aphel.  Aphel there is less agency of what is happening in terms of when the guns (abilities) come up.
[6:49:43] Senz: kill bad guy, yep learned it
[6:49:50] Halofan642: he was lurking but he laughed at me being banned

[6:55:29] Halofan642: its probably worse than what ur thinking
[6:55:30] Tananabear: giving people the benefit of the doubt? absolutely not

[7:08:27] Cleophi: is the support item on adc the meta? any adc?
[7:08:43] Tananabear: HI PLEN
[7:08:47] Tananabear: I SEE YOU
[7:09:06] Halofan642: its rly good on lucian
[7:09:30] Tananabear: ^
[7:09:57] Lodba: he needs to only use that proc on minions or you get penalty no ?
[7:10:28] Halofan642: @Lodba not right now, he doesnt have the debuff
[7:10:39] Halofan642: you can see the debuff on the hotbar above his abilities when its applicable
[7:12:36] Lodba: isent the point never to get the penelty
[7:13:15] pureiinsanity: Ashe R
[7:13:17] pureiinsanity: off cd
[7:14:15] Halofan642: u could go crown item
[7:14:20] Halofan642: if u just play for r
[7:14:24] Halofan642: but that sounds bad now that i type it out
[7:14:31] Tananabear: these ads are aids
[7:14:52] GandorTheGreat: How does double supp item work? They removed minion farm penalty?
[7:15:20] Halofan642: @GandorTheGreat the penalty doesnt apply if you use the supp item to execute minions or some shit
[7:16:32] GandorTheGreat: @halofan642 ye. But that's like for 3 minions/minute. U farm like 10 normally if u r good. Or did I miss something?
[7:17:06] hughjanus9001: zac lowkey trolling
[7:17:33] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[7:18:45] Tananabear: do you only build the support item on lethality caitlyn?>
[7:19:47] Halofan642: @GandorTheGreat ur maybe forgetting the other supp item also counting for gold, so its like 7 minions a minute which is half the minions i think, which is good bc when u proc the stack it gives u 20 flat gold and your teammate the full gold, so the gold u get from penalty is made up from sup pitem
[7:20:38] Halofan642: and then the supp item also gives an extra .5 gold per second after u complete it
[7:20:54] Halofan642: and then the items themselves are really strong (8% increased dmg taken from all sources and a sheen proc isnt fair)
[7:21:02] Halofan642: and then the 4 extra wards is really insane in soloq
[7:21:18] GandorTheGreat: @halofan642 oh. Makes sense. That can work!
[7:21:21] Halofan642: 10 cs/m not really viable in soloq ur probably playing game wrong if ur at 10 cs/m
[7:21:29] coolwaveofcalm: Crit for caitlyn is really good now
[7:21:50] Halofan642: imo games are too chaotic to make 10 cs/m viable/the best option, 7-8 is more realistic

[10:18:28] cameron416: the support item is just not balanced well enough idk what rito was cooking this season
[10:18:34] Halofan642: and you get +20 gold whenever you use a stack, regardless if you have the penalty or not
