[1:22:37] gretchen2137: shadowflame is only good when enemy team has a lot of shields
[1:22:38] Niomah: @Sir_Fish_Bucket Not with current MR items they don't
[1:22:52] Niomah: Just one of them is 80MR by itself
[1:23:12] som963: Shadowflame bonus dmg to shield mechanic is gone no
[1:23:14] Sir_Fish_Bucket: @Niomah I mean with MR void would be a better counter than a shadow anywhos
[1:23:37] gretchen2137: i dont actually know i never build it
[1:24:00] Yvernaa: Fizz's dmg is ridiculous...
[1:24:08] doublemeatpalace: @gretchen2137 Nah. It has less pen but can crit below like 35% health or something
[1:24:14] Sir_Fish_Bucket: stormsurge wouldve killed there
[1:24:14] boeboe_88: Is there an ad champ that feels very mage like to play as?

[1:25:01] som963: With this build
[1:25:14] boeboe_88: @Gar116 is he decent mid?
[1:25:21] Niomah: with just the 80MR item Void only reduces their MR to 32
[1:25:31] TFPhage: jayce?
[1:25:31] Gar116: @boeboe_88 I don't play him, but I have seen him mid lots of times

[1:25:44] nicorasenpai: kaisa?
[1:25:45] boeboe_88: okii thx
[1:26:05] cropwoman: do you think that cryptbloom is a better item than void with its AOE healing?
[1:26:06] mrry2k: this soraka skin with that chroma is probably one of if not the prettiest skins in the game rn
[1:26:09] Niomah: so do you wanna do...56 more damage or double damage?

[2:03:36] nicolasxduarte: @joako_olmos viva el fernet

[2:08:46] Sir_FrodoBaggins: yeah, thanks. wow
[2:08:57] mbob61: Good damage!!
[2:09:21] omar_j6: my concern is it be good for few months and then it turns back to what it was
[2:09:26] Sir_FrodoBaggins: yeah i just wanted to see the gold you got vs the other lanes without it
[2:09:29] mbob61: Seraphine puts in big work!
[2:09:46] LunaSolfier: hii:)
[2:09:48] starkillertofu: what lux buffs? Kelsie doesnt need to be any more swol

[2:11:19] Darkcyter: @kenadams03 FeelsBirthdayMan
[2:11:45] kenadams03: @Darkcyter TY DARK LOL
[2:11:46] Nauway: That's how I feel about it
[2:11:47] Sir_FrodoBaggins: if only there was a preseason that could have prevented this from happening in live/pro :P
[2:11:52] coifmonkeey: thanks :d
[2:11:52] xKitton: are you talking about the double support item strat?
[2:11:56] starkillertofu: it depends on what support item they have and if they are procing the exicute for the gold
[2:12:00] tahieeeel: HEEY
[2:12:04] mbob61: That double support item combo will be going away soon. Gotta abuse it while it's still there
[2:12:13] twinkerbell_xo: yeah both laners get the full amount of gold for the minions so it's very good
[2:12:34] xKitton: It works so well because normally you get 14g for a caster minion, but if the adc takes it instead he gets 20g.
[2:12:35] IoSonoBatman: Op kaypLUL
[2:12:37] Jaguar542: When you have the gold support item and kill a lot of minions you get decreased gold for a little while.
[2:12:37] KinKaray: The money generation aspect of it
[2:12:42] twinkerbell_xo: you get a free item for like 400 gold so it's very gold efficient
[2:12:51] mbob61: The amount of Cs you can take but keep getting support item gold is too high
[2:12:56] museguy: what runes did you go with Sera?
[2:13:22] kehduskwhebeskb: kaypFreya
[2:13:28] Gar116: Yeah there's a farm penalty on support items
[2:13:48] Gar116: But I guess it didn't stop you from making bank last game! lol
[2:13:53] mbob61: They should stop it after 3-4 cs per minute
[2:14:06] TyrTheTiny: this song makes me want to dance in rave lights
[2:14:09] xKitton: And it only works if the adc uses his support stacks on the minions becuase otherwise if he uses the stacks on enemy. He takes too muich minions and he'll get the penalty
[2:14:19] yayevee: No still is
[2:14:24] mbob61: CS penalty is negated by both people sharing the cs so you don't hit that cap
[2:14:30] clutchammons: !rank
[2:14:30] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=No+Cannon+No+Cry%23pea%2CKarma+Pengu
[2:14:34] nicolasxduarte: I could never play mid because I am afraid of katarina lol
[2:14:37] coifmonkeey: since you are canadian, I want to go roadtrip Canada this year. Do you have any places you would advise that i should deffo visit? @KayPea
[2:14:52] Sir_FrodoBaggins: just looked it up, before 5 mins killing 7 minions or more reduces gold from them by 80%
[2:14:58] ataraxia78: @nicolasxduarte Ban her?
[2:15:07] tturkeybaconclub: hey me too. 604 represent!
[2:15:11] xBoomShotBaby: this song always puts me in a good mood
[2:15:12] Sir_FrodoBaggins: after 5 mins killing 4 per min reduces it to 50-80% based on kills
[2:15:15] Sunnytinker: i just love how Freya just slowly slides farther and farther off the pillow throughout the stream
[2:15:17] nicolasxduarte: @ataraxia78 I am also afraid of zed :(
[2:15:31] Jaguar542: I saw you one time get 7 gold for a minion LUL
[2:15:39] coifmonkeey: alright ill add vancouver to the list then :D just looking around a bit now. planning on going for 2 months
[2:15:44] twinkerbell_xo: that's why both the adc and support have to balance out the minions between eachother so there's no penalty
[2:15:51] mbob61: I wouldn't worry, it'll be gone soon. They're doing it in Korean pro play 😁
[2:16:06] ataraxia78: @ataraxia78 I think Zed is more manageable than Kata
[2:16:09] Sir_FrodoBaggins: so if you are killing alot of minions with it you get 80% reduced gold from the minion kills
[2:16:30] sherager: “damn that’s crazy :)” vibe tbh
[2:16:30] Sir_Fish_Bucket: The numbers mason, what do they mean
[2:17:03] Jaguar542: The only numbers that matter is HP, MP, gold and how much damages Lux Rainbow does
[2:17:11] Sir_FrodoBaggins: yes
[2:17:17] Nauway: its the same
[2:17:17] nacrtana: Hello,how you doing KayPea?You are look soooooo gorgeus ^_^
[2:17:24] Nauway: its the three orbs that are on you
[2:17:25] mbob61: The idea is to share Cs equally with the support 🙂
[2:17:29] kouzis: thats called intuition
[2:17:38] tturkeybaconclub: @coifmonkeey if you have time i highly recommend a trip to vancouver island as well. victoria/sunshine coast especially, if you are new to the area.
[2:17:45] Sir_FrodoBaggins: only reduced gold from minion kills, the poke ones and the execute ones and the gold per second is still normal
[2:17:54] Sir_Fish_Bucket: Only numbers I care about is how hard my morde bonk hits
[2:18:03] tahieeeel: lux supp feels so much powerful and useful too
[2:18:09] Sir_FrodoBaggins: so that seems to be more than what you are losing from the reduced gold
[2:18:24] Sir_FrodoBaggins: any way ill be quiet now :p have a good game

[2:20:49] Darkcyter: @KinKaray kaypHello
[2:20:50] Nauway: I dont think its the extra gold as much as the gold income rate on the item + regen effects + tertiary effects from the final item selection. I agree that the item cost is low so that helps as well, but the income rate boost is really nice

[3:02:02] BloodyAngelx: The league attracts gamers of all ages, but data shows most active players are between the age of 21-24 as of late 2023. Male gamers dominate League's player base, making up 87% of users.  Guess it makes sense the assume it

[3:12:03] Mithrandir_Lightbringer: OOM
[3:12:21] sovitiaisavampire: anivia is pinguin, thats why
[3:12:29] starkillertofu: she has the lowest base move in the game
[3:12:34] ajak636: riot needs to give her a visual update at least after shyvana
[3:12:44] MiyukiKowa: is it just me or does it feel like everyone moves slower this patch
[3:12:48] Niomah: well she's got ice on her wings so it slows her down :D
[3:12:57] boeboe_88: @starkillertofu isnt it cass?
[3:13:05] yepein73: Hows the game going

[3:14:47] ferriswheel8: @ajak636 he prob won't get a visual update tho because literally nobody plays him :(
[3:15:11] pusheencatt1: i think gragas needs a visual update D:
[3:15:36] jstutey: surprised he not perma roaming
[3:15:42] MiyukiKowa: isnt anivia a fizz counter?
[3:15:48] ajak636: he will get one... in the mmo eventually Kappa
[3:16:19] ferriswheel8: @pusheencatt1 that's actually way better considering the fact that he is so popular nowadays and also the fact of his charming looks

[3:17:07] pusheencatt1: @ferriswheel8 yeah. i got him a couple of times in aram and thought his base model just moved really really weird
[3:17:16] ballzagna1: @maverick_mc221 we take those!
[3:17:31] beansprout94: beansprout94 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:17:44] maverick_mc221: @ballzagna1 we do!
[3:17:48] Yvernaa: Fizz is an example of why I started being a Vex main, to bully every cringe assassin champion
[3:17:51] FiveFM: …while under turret
[3:18:19] ballzagna1: speaking of vex. i had someone pick a riven into my vex mid. it didnt go well for her
[3:18:25] ballzagna1: every q procs passive

[3:19:20] coifmonkeey: mmr dropped haaard pff from playing P1/emerald first game to now playing G1/p3 enemies
[3:19:31] ferriswheel8: Watching your anivia gameplay is quite literally mesmerizing kaypFlower
[3:19:37] ThirstyForJustice: Have you used Malignance w/ Anivia ult?
[3:19:51] Mithrandir_Lightbringer: NT
[3:19:52] ballzagna1: so close
[3:20:03] toyturtlesruwu: why is your team just giving them free drakes
[3:20:58] ballzagna1: his ping turned into a zed
[3:21:48] ObsceneSanity: wouldnt riftmaker & liandrys on a roa anivia be strong?
[3:21:59] Cyrodilian: Oh what Anivia skin is this - looks cool?
[3:22:07] ballzagna1: she also flashed for the E rip
[3:22:11] ballzagna1: if not she just dies
[3:22:49] ferriswheel8: @Cyrodilian im pretty sure it's called divine phoenix, and it's a chroma
[3:23:15] ObsceneSanity: I see ahri is getting a buff
[3:23:19] mysteri99: That didnt age well Pantheon about them being bad
[3:23:59] MiyukiKowa: they have a really annoying team
[3:24:13] toyturtlesruwu: song fitting for what they are doing to your towers and inhibitor
[3:24:29] xBoomShotBaby: Teemo being the little devil he is
[3:24:36] jxyde_2353: adc anivia with that attack range
[3:24:42] starkillertofu: birb stole a rapid fire cannon
[3:25:59] TyrTheTiny: that was so upsetting
[3:26:01] TyrTheTiny: let's flame
[3:26:22] Smoothcollie: Looked like the frost vanished, u didn't do a crit with E
[3:26:35] ThirstyForJustice: Teemo might be bug abusing
[3:26:39] starkillertofu: pretty sure first time yone
[3:26:59] TyrTheTiny: do you build shadowflame on anivia?
[3:27:02] ThirstyForJustice: Their is a bug w/ Hexplate where buying and selling multiple times stacks the passive
[3:27:11] Smoothcollie: Emote now bitch
[3:27:21] maverick_mc221: yone will scale so i feel like this is winnable. so does anivia
[3:27:23] Smoothcollie: Oop don't be toxic
[3:27:36] ferriswheel8: @Smoothcollie LMAO THAT'S SO OFFENSIVE
[3:27:48] TyrTheTiny: BUT IS ALSO RIGHT
[3:27:54] pusheencatt1: @Smoothcollie ?
[3:28:03] ferriswheel8: @TyrTheTiny LITERALLY
[3:28:20] Smoothcollie: @ferriswheel8 Emote now bissch, does this sound less offensive? kaypLUL
[3:28:31] pusheencatt1: oof i read that put of context oops
[3:28:40] MiyukiKowa: 0-10 scale yone
[3:28:52] Smoothcollie: Yeye, dw, I thought so kaypH5 @pusheencatt1
[3:28:56] ferriswheel8: @Smoothcollie definitely sounds more extravagant LUL
[3:29:07] Niomah: Malignance is awesome on Anivia with Liandrys
[3:29:14] TyrTheTiny: yone doesn't scale, he is just like akshan or yasuo, the same high damage always, even when losing
[3:29:16] ferriswheel8: GGs
[3:29:23] ObsceneSanity: she went 2/4 to 8/4
[3:29:42] ObsceneSanity: malph sorta counters yone
[3:29:53] sajmonstepien: oh well
[3:29:58] Frozenfruit13: first to 10 though!
[3:29:59] LittleChewrrie: The games have been good today !!
[3:30:02] TyrTheTiny: so is not waiting for him to scale, is jut waiting for him to be better at using his high damage.
[3:30:07] TheLiin: do you ever build malignance on nivia?
[3:30:08] sajmonstepien: hopefully next game will be better
[3:30:12] Frozenfruit13: we did!!
[3:30:21] starkillertofu: @ObsceneSanity not if your a good yone. because he has hybrid dmg
[3:30:23] pusheencatt1: your team got 10 kills first
[3:30:39] Smoothcollie: U lost with yone on your team, what a dark times happening to league kaypAwkward
[3:30:44] jua_araujo: Heey KP. how u doing?? Sorry i got late
[3:30:46] TheLiin: cant decide between malig and liandry
[3:30:51] anakinskywalker50166: hi what elo are you ?
[3:30:57] sajmonstepien: Do you sometimes just get bored of league? :o
[3:31:06] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity malph only has to hit his r on yone and the team can clean up.
[3:31:09] sajmonstepien: after games like that
[3:31:11] Smoothcollie: But still, it's YONE. He should mega bully in late
[3:31:26] starkillertofu: @ObsceneSanity sure but that doesnt explain why yone lost lane.
[3:31:28] maverick_mc221: yeah def yone should have done more, but idk. guess the team did fall apart. you had the early game with kha and bot. anivia and yone do good late.
[3:31:41] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity zed camped top lane
[3:31:57] olson869: Your next stream is in 21 hrs
[3:32:13] Smoothcollie: See the puma kaypSpy kaypLove
[3:32:14] Darkcyter: kaypFreya
[3:32:18] Darkcyter: kaypRonin
[3:32:26] RaynKire: Too many egss in the Kha basket (he got most the early kills) that fell apart when Teemo had access to his jungle
[3:32:27] TyrTheTiny: not ronning doing parkour
[3:32:29] maverick_mc221: is Xerath a lux counter?
[3:32:41] Darkcyter: kaypFreya doesn't mind kaypRonin 's presence anymore
[3:32:48] torge_154: how are you Today @kaypea kaypLove looking good as always kaypPengu
[3:32:57] Mknudsen89: 4-1 looking good! ;)

[3:33:04] kaliwanss: hellooo darling, hyd?
[3:33:13] torge_154: im good ty kaypLove
[3:33:16] Niomah: Malphite is basically unkillable though and everyone uses up all their stuff on him, at least in ARAM, futilely
[3:33:38] EnigmaticYeenBean: Zed and Teemo just had insane pressure that cracked the teams rotations. And it went bad from there
[3:33:53] TyrTheTiny: aren't you tired to lose? time to use the secret weapon and unleash the main, yasuo game!
[3:33:55] sajmonstepien: Did u win that earlier seraphine game?
[3:34:21] FiveFM: Have they fixed the bot lane double support item thingy?
[3:34:30] ThirstyForJustice: Yeah, that's been fixed
[3:34:34] Smoothcollie: Another teemo, jeez what's up with today. 2x fizz 2x teemo (what I know)
[3:34:37] Limpix_: !op.gg
[3:34:38] ThirstyForJustice: Wait, that hasn't been patched?
[3:34:40] ObsceneSanity: next patch
[3:34:45] ThirstyForJustice: ohh
[3:35:00] EnigmaticYeenBean: Teemo always has been insane setting up pressure like that.. these new items make it even more brutal to ignore I feel.
[3:35:02] ThirstyForJustice: I'm guessing the Hexplate bug is still a thing then
[3:35:03] Limpix_: Starting P2 not to shabby @KayPea
[3:35:22] sweetpersephone: I just hope they're not going to nerf the support item to the ground :(
[3:35:23] ObsceneSanity: i didnt think they havent said specifically what their fix will be
[3:35:26] ThirstyForJustice: You can buy and sell it repeatedly and it reduces your ult cd to zero
[3:35:33] ThirstyForJustice: Undo*
[3:35:38] Limpix_: P2 80LP kaypComfy @KayPea
[3:35:41] ObsceneSanity: @ThirstyForJustice that was patched before s14 launched

[3:38:55] lewhitehd69: another sera game ratirlOH
[3:39:04] EnigmaticYeenBean: I play mostly AP champs.. the oversaturation of them make men not wanna play cause I dont play games where MR is stacked against me and we lose from too much AP
[3:39:04] lewhitehd69: oh an with a soraka
[3:39:42] ferriswheel8: @mark__yeahhh yeah that's probably because of these huge support changes
[3:39:51] dispumpkin: 2 ads vs 2 mage/supports, uuuh, waiting for big trades
[3:40:01] Z0LL3: howdy kp
[3:40:08] ShodaCharmed: Ohhh a friend of mine choreoghraphed a line dance to this song! PogChamp
[3:40:39] RadiantWisp: what item does Soraka have that allows her to last hit and give you money?
[3:41:01] TyrTheTiny: this is so sad, let's build a tear

[3:41:26] ferriswheel8: @RadiantWisp It's a new support item that gives gold when you damage enemies, hit structures or finish off minions all together
[3:41:45] MiyukiKowa: we love an aggressive soraka
[3:41:46] RadiantWisp: @ferriswheel8 thanks, is it world atlas or something else?
[3:42:03] ObsceneSanity: @RadiantWisp supports have only one item now, but you can to transform it into your choice of 5 items
[3:42:14] ferriswheel8: Yeah exactly, forgot what it was called LUL
[3:42:47] dispumpkin: almost NotLikeThis
[3:42:49] Smoothcollie: U almost get both out of there, damn
[3:42:53] GunzaPrime: what in the bottom lane fuckery, ashe kait?
[3:43:09] RadiantWisp: oh I see now why I was not getting minion kills, it's because damaging enemy champions consumes the same charge as killing minions with it
[3:43:17] ferriswheel8: I think its worth to get the caster minions since killing them normally grants less gold than killing them with the support passive, i might be wrong tho
[3:43:19] ObsceneSanity: @GunzaDBD i forget which one, but ashe has huge synergy with the support item
[3:43:47] ObsceneSanity: why there is a ton of shaco and panth supports now too
[3:43:53] alluring_grace: @ObsceneSanity similar with Ashe Zyra, Cait lux, morg cait
[3:43:54] ThirstyForJustice: Bloodsong gives damage amp and Ashe can stack it almost instantly w/ her Q
[3:43:58] maverick_mc221: THAT FARM THO
[3:43:58] RadiantWisp: support passive always gives 20 gold to support and KILL gold to the other champion
[3:43:59] GunzaPrime: NODDERS
[3:44:03] RadiantWisp: so it's the same
[3:44:03] GunzaPrime: today i learned
[3:44:17] x3litzx: hiii
[3:44:37] ferriswheel8: @RadiantWisp Lol i always get so confused because i last hit a minion and then poke enemies to get gold, but it turns out that ive already used my stacks LUL
[3:44:44] RadiantWisp: oh wait I see what you mean, she has support item too
[3:45:00] MiyukiKowa: hasnt people been running double support item in botlane when they go seraphine and soraka?
[3:45:04] ferriswheel8: Wp!
[3:45:15] RadiantWisp: @ferriswheel8 was the support item charge-less in last patch? just farm enemies all you want
[3:45:22] RadiantWisp: the ranged support item I mean
[3:45:22] ObsceneSanity: @MiyukiKowa i had a game where 3 people on the team built the support item. :)
[3:45:33] nicorasenpai: soraka is kinda safe playing
[3:46:01] maverick_mc221: im a bit shocked that neeko is losing to zoe tho.
[3:46:05] arcadedani: lol
[3:46:19] shyven_: poor kayn
[3:46:25] arcadedani: Ashe was like not today
[3:46:30] ferriswheel8: @RadiantWisp i don't think so
[3:46:30] lupilion: Helloooo
[3:46:53] Frozenfruit13: @radiantwisp the ranged support item didn’t have stacks just 500 damage so if you played a high damage support you could finish it really quick
[3:46:59] FiveFM: Now now 'Raka. We've been saying this ALL day! We can come back! kaypCheer
[3:47:21] MiyukiKowa: @ObsceneSanity thats what i thought its been mostly healer botlane with all running support items
[3:47:32] shyven_: that skin's Q is so pretty
[3:47:33] tulatulips: What build do you suggest on app seraphine?
[3:47:38] ObsceneSanity: @MiyukiKowa ive been getting lethality supports
[3:47:46] FiveFM: Hey! An old school map ward!

[3:48:30] Hattnissen: Hello Lucas!
[3:48:34] ObsceneSanity: and best believe i took the support item top with teemo, seeing how its zazzak is best item on him
[3:48:35] papagantr: papagantr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! kaypCheer kaypCheer
[3:48:48] nicorasenpai: shes probably thinking i aint using my ult on that
[3:49:05] Smoothcollie: Vikings in the basement! Safe your stuff!!!
[3:49:23] ferriswheel8: @ivygun You start of with a 400g atlas of worlds which further transforms into other items and when you reach 1000g on the support quest you may choose one of 5 different items to get which have specific passives
[3:49:33] Smoothcollie: Roni kaypSpy Roni now honey, yes Roni kaypLove
[3:50:06] RaynKire: The double support item strat doesn't work as well with roamers
[3:50:21] beabeagorilla: have you played against a sion yet? they can basically solo game
[3:50:24] maverick_mc221: your farm is exquisit
[3:50:42] dispumpkin: the best feeling is when u r able to mute someone like this, golden
[3:51:27] Buddahmonk: damnn robbed, Riot Coding Op
[3:51:33] SanskaariGaming: lol
[3:51:42] dispumpkin: that flash was pure gold too, u tricked rammus lol
[3:51:43] FlamingCheff: WOW that was amazing!!!
[3:51:50] maverick_mc221: LOL
[3:51:50] ferriswheel8: Lmao this soraka has had enough
[3:51:56] xBoomShotBaby: why are all the sorakas so toxic and tilted all the time kaypLOL
[3:52:03] Nauway: wow this soraka needs a chill pill
[3:52:03] Yvernaa: Just played Vex against Fizz, the guy was about to ragequit LOL
[3:52:42] Buddahmonk: “Just stop inting and let me heal you”
[3:52:44] Yvernaa: I swear Riot made Vex just so that the assassins can get bullied for once
[3:52:54] ivygun: @ferriswheel8 thank you ! but having the last item is worth building late or u just sell it ?
[3:52:57] Trishia_Schwartz: last few raka's you've had have been angry lol
[3:53:02] ph0enixpearl: I feel like Soraka is a bit selfish, Idk why
[3:53:08] Buddahmonk: “are you too good for your heals” - Happy Gilmore
[3:53:14] NewRegion24: what are the flames do?
[3:53:33] ferriswheel8: @ivygun It actually depends on your gold situation. I prefer leaving it until i have enough gold for a final 6th item and then sell it, because it's passive can be really op
[3:54:10] NewRegion24: WOW didn't play in a long time, a lot of new things
[3:54:20] Nauway: no
[3:54:23] RadiantWisp: no
[3:54:26] RaynKire: I think not quite...
[3:54:26] Smoothcollie: Don't think so
[3:54:29] Buddahmonk: I really need them to nerf the AP items
[3:54:32] pachekinh0_: soraka didn't ult again
[3:54:44] Tsatire: @KayPea  Happy Hump Day!  Hope everyone is having a wonderful Day!
[3:54:45] dispumpkin: sometimes feels like kp loses games cause ppl on her team just cant chill
[3:54:50] ph0enixpearl: @pachekinh0_ How I said, Soraka is a bit selfish for what it seems...
[3:54:50] ivygun: @ferriswheel8 oh i see thanks for the information i really appreciate that 🙏
[3:54:53] Smoothcollie: Yeye, if it would do a lot of dmg, it would be too much
[3:54:58] perlasc_: SeemsGood
[3:55:02] ferriswheel8: @ivygun anytime!

[3:56:11] RaynKire: You going moonstone then?
[3:56:26] ferriswheel8: Wouldn't shadowflame be good this game? It stacks with your q's crit and it counters rammus
[3:56:41] imercygamer: Hello KP kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer
[3:56:54] ferriswheel8: Or maybe the cryptbloom for magic pen and additional heal
[3:57:09] Smoothcollie: Omg this theme kaypInLove
[3:57:35] Smoothcollie: Let's ride some drags
[3:57:35] ferriswheel8: The dream maker should be good since you shield a lot
[3:57:37] lupilion: lupilion subscribed with Prime. 
[3:57:49] MiyukiKowa: isnt it suppose to be the bear looking one?
[3:57:52] RaynKire: Enchanter supp item I think
[3:58:37] ObsceneSanity: you should do the one that amps your dmg
[3:58:40] Buddahmonk: the bubbles is for healing
[3:58:52] weareblob: pretty sure with a soraka and a mid not doing so hot y’all might need the extra deeps
[3:58:58] ataraxia78: song sound like The Hobbit
[3:59:11] Smoothcollie: Can u change the choice of your supp item?
[3:59:12] Alcazarr_: helüüü alcaza5Dans alcaza5Dans
[3:59:12] RaynKire: Dreamsong if you have a good carry on the team
[3:59:15] Smoothcollie: Oh u cannot
[3:59:23] Buddahmonk: at this elo, an item won’t make that much of a difference
[3:59:28] Buddahmonk: mental booms OP
[3:59:38] ObsceneSanity: you cna try to get neeko back into the game
[4:00:03] Buddahmonk: I wish you could cancel it for a short period incase you misclick
[4:00:17] Buddahmonk: Like cancel the upgrade or revert it
[4:00:19] lupilion: one of the best LoL streamers on twitch ! ;)
[4:00:33] Gar116: Ward Wars
[4:00:34] ferriswheel8: The ward wars are real NotLikeThis
[4:00:59] Buddahmonk: Definitely a pillar, most of the OG streamers all left
[4:01:04] weareblob: but also f- it you do what you want it’s a new season and you’re trying different stuff
[4:01:25] Jaketin8: @Smoothcollie I think you can, but its whole mess to do. Not sure if it was bug or how it works, but it seems you need to sell the old one, get the starter support item and redo the quest and then you can again choose, so its not exactly worth doing
[4:01:38] MiyukiKowa: is cryptbloom a good item?
[4:01:50] Kiuzu: kaypHello
[4:01:50] chaton_garou_fr: Hello everyone 😁
[4:01:54] Buddahmonk: Might have to go back like 5 years and see one of the Twitch events you were in for league
[4:02:14] FiveFM: Nah the Cryptoboom was over a few years ago... oh wait, nm
[4:02:17] Buddahmonk: I still forget how long ago Poki left
[4:02:26] ferriswheel8: @MiyukiKowa I think there are a lot of items that are better, because i've played cryptbloom morg today and it was not really effective
[4:02:26] Smoothcollie: @jaketin8 Oh ye, that makes sense, that's how old supp items worked. If I remember correctly? But I get ya, it would take a long time
[4:02:38] SanskaariGaming: you got the arrow
[4:02:48] ObsceneSanity: neeko only have one full item?
[4:02:50] poisonbey: omg youre playin seraa
[4:02:51] kermiytt: what lux buff
[4:02:56] Alex_6_ftw: helloooo @KayPea <3 its been a while, how are you?

[4:03:22] kermiytt: wow
[4:03:32] kermiytt: thanks
[4:03:52] ferriswheel8: ofc :)
[4:03:54] Jaketin8: @Smoothcollie Yes, old ones was pretty much the same, only bit "harder/more annoying" with having to choose between minion execution or champ poking to progress, now they are both in it, so makes it bit "simpler"

[4:09:08] Jaketin8: @Smoothcollie Np, not 100% sure tho, i only did it once, so not fully sure if it works or if it was bug
[4:09:13] lima234234: Hi!
[4:09:48] alluring_grace: cait pretty strong now too
[4:09:56] coifmonkeey: ugh 0-5 inc team already calling each other names before the game even started @KayPea
[4:10:10] ferriswheel8: its crazy how not a single enemy bought serpents fang for your shields
[4:10:21] ferriswheel8: and your teammates dont take advantage of that
[4:10:33] Gar116: The Jax with the audacity to question ping you
