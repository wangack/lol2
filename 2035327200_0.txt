[8:00:31] labboo14: Near Earth, we cannot ever escape the pull of gravity. However, small objects can be levitated by using an effect called diamagnetism. Superconductors are strongly diamagnetic, meaning that they magnetize in a way that tends to push them out of strong field regions. Superconductors can be levitated fairly easily.
