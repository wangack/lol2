[0:33:01] milesyoungblood: reminding me every day why I perma ban renekton
[0:33:35] dantexn: what did he ban ? hi there btw
[0:33:45] milesyoungblood: don’t remember
[0:33:46] milesyoungblood: hi
[0:34:51] milesyoungblood: is going eclipse even good vs renekton since he crushes sheilds
[0:35:18] milesyoungblood: death dances looking good here but I’m low plat idk
[0:35:24] milesyoungblood: don’t listen to me
[0:35:38] dentysta: @milesyoungblood how likely is that u proc eclipse when he has empowered W
[0:35:42] lolkotek: friendly fire
[0:35:48] milesyoungblood: @dentysta idk
[0:35:55] NothHellNoaKnight: i feel like zzk build might be superior maybe it's best for my playstyle, bruiser riven feels goodge
[0:36:22] Osyxx: whats zzk build
[0:36:35] NothHellNoaKnight: bc > sunderer > dd
[0:36:44] NothHellNoaKnight: other bruiser stuff like sterak/maw
[0:36:50] drakonken: Does riven scales better than rumble in late game?
[0:36:56] drakonken: cause lane phase looks unwinnable to me
[0:37:30] NothHellNoaKnight: she does what rumble cant but she does not exactly outscale him
[0:37:39] waitdontshootme: I feel like the zzk build almost makes it harder to snowball bc the early build path doesn’t provide a lot of damage, mostly survivability. but once u do get the BC it feels solid
[0:37:54] Nightbot: Sub to the stream if you want to see me stream everyday and to support my journey of full time streaming! Thank you and enjoy
[0:38:15] tozakiwr: i guess zzk build is good into matchups thats easy for you
[0:38:17] NothHellNoaKnight: @waitdontshootme that's what i mean, i'm not snowballing very often but with zzk build i'm not falling far behind when lane is lost
[0:38:17] jaxinsux: tf is that dmg
[0:38:25] giadrome8998: Rumble melted us
[0:38:30] 1A2lol: yeah shaco support looks pretty useful
[0:38:31] nicolag__: maw?
[0:38:32] NekoFunk: one rumble q just oneshots people
[0:38:36] drakonken: feel like rumble is stronger now
[0:38:38] tozakiwr: zzk build is more safe
[0:38:41] drakonken: than last season
[0:38:42] NothHellNoaKnight: @tozakiwr complete oposite of what it's for me, i do it in hard matchups
[0:38:47] 1A2lol: all ap champs are fucking insane this season
[0:38:53] Aarguil: can't wait for the nerfs
[0:39:00] NothHellNoaKnight: @1A2lol yep gonna be nerfed as fuck
[0:39:04] julianthebulian: shaco sp AD shld be bannable no?
[0:39:08] waitdontshootme: @nothhellnoaknight ya I agree. I just hate they changed the build path so much. like why would an item focused on shredding armor and dealing damage thematically be built focused on HP items? give us pickaxe back
[0:39:29] Vaaqu: eclipse or shojin first? or just match up based
[0:39:30] dentysta: @NothHellNoaKnight i feel like riven needs to get a head and not try to  not fall behind
[0:39:32] 1A2lol: @Viper you tried akali yet this season
[0:39:33] Aarguil: better than nothing I guess
[0:39:34] T1Tesko: @julianthebulian pretty much yeah
[0:39:45] lolkotek: inefficient shaco sup
[0:40:05] drakonken: @NothHellNoaKnight what is zzk build?
[0:40:17] waitdontshootme: BC > sunder > dd
[0:40:20] NothHellNoaKnight: @dentysta ofc she is, but it's not always possible, and with zzk build it's not that bad if you didnt mamange to get ahead

[0:40:43] Osyxx: they need 2 bring back champion spotlights so phreak can have his old role back
[0:40:59] dentysta: Yeah but with that buildpath its like ur almost asking to never get ahead and snowball
[0:42:04] UchigatanaCL: cant learn shit with map cover Kappa

[0:45:01] boteren: Do u think u can make riven work with 3 damage item and 2 full tank items like randuins ?
[0:45:02] dentysta: @hex13 nothing special, 3rd wave crash into quick double cast dive on renek cuz rumble was ganking

[0:54:26] Reads__: I think if you build to side or get picks it might be better
[0:54:27] T1Tesko: You had no mid and support tbh
[0:54:27] apecant: cleaver? idk what sundered sky does tho so could fill the same role
[0:54:39] julianthebulian: shldve build AP and outdo the shaco in griefing
[0:54:48] Reads__: there needed to be a pen item somewhere in there
[0:54:49] tozakiwr: i think ap shaco  wouldve made the game 3x easier

[0:56:46] tozakiwr: i wanna try crit riven now
[0:56:53] airflashh3: it is really bad against armor
[0:56:53] tozakiwr: ie sundered lord doms
[0:56:54] RivalOCE: nah I would’ve done the same tbh
[0:57:08] milesyoungblood: would cleaver had been good instead of sunderer
[0:57:18] RivalOCE: but it’s a good lesson, sunder v squishies is disgusting, but even vs tabi it loses so much value
[0:57:28] 1shinsu: i think only fiora/jax can hard carry your last game.
[0:57:32] T1Tesko: I think bc instead of sundered sky would've been good, but I think it was still lost because of Yasuo and AD Shaco support LOL
[0:57:44] tozakiwr: solo ad with sundered
[0:57:45] milesyoungblood: that’s true since tabis lowers autos by percent @rivaloce

[2:54:07] airflashh3: think the problem is its more op in teamfights
[2:54:09] airflashh3: than 1v1
[2:54:10] airflashh3: for sure
[2:54:12] hache_esse: sunderer + eclipse is insanely broken
[2:54:18] airflashh3: yea but domination second sucks in lane

[2:54:24] airflashh3: but u right
[2:54:27] hache_esse: actually
[2:54:32] hache_esse: since they changed lethality
