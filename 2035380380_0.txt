[3:17:13] zafirovzz: @shisui9920 yeah but with yone its worse cuz he slows you for 90% and slows attack speed soooo much
[3:17:15] DarthConstantine13: @candaink Clueless
[3:17:18] ivan_beifong: the champ is just unskilled, he buys titanic and you suddenly dont deal any damage and it only goes downhill from there
[3:17:23] StrawberryBursts: @Xeslex tjat
[3:17:24] blek957: @Dzukill  do u ever go 0/10 as yone when ur repeatedly dove and refused to be played around?
[3:17:26] denyxc: renek is good only for early but soon with 2-3 items he is useless
[3:17:33] JDragon7309: this guy dodging every yone ult when he kills if he tanks it
[3:17:34] droby13: @zafirovzz easies matchup he goes 50 cs down early and 2 levels only outscales after 5 items what are you on
[3:17:34] ivan_beifong: @denyxc false
[3:17:35] zzzz1334: OneGuy
[3:17:40] StrawberryBursts: That's only cause average yone player has brain damage @Xeslex
[3:17:43] DarthConstantine13: @candaink REDDITOR SPOTTED
[3:17:46] denyxc: @ivan_beifong with 2-3 items yone can kill him alone
[3:17:47] Blazze30: chat press 1 if you think yone is op
[3:17:47] Ronflexronflex: yone otp = opinion discarded YEP
[3:17:48] candaink: @Xeslex because hes played by interesting and unique creatures
[3:17:50] uuMorg: renek is good in every state of the game
[3:17:55] ivan_beifong: yep
[3:17:55] shisui9920: @zafirovzz fair enough, but I think there's just more cancer champs
[3:17:58] litchi66: @denyxc true
[3:17:58] Xeslex: Not an argument
[3:18:10] zafirovzz: @shisui9920 idk thats from my experience
[3:18:12] Xeslex: Literally
[3:18:14] TomTripping: Streaming
[3:18:18] StrawberryBursts: I never said he's easy to play man
[3:18:28] Daron100: yone is my int pick top
[3:18:32] candaink: I got a question, youre saying yone is hard?
[3:18:37] lol_noxy: !item
[3:18:37] Nightbot: https://youtu.be/NT1GmOXUV8Q?si=V27iIOl6y9_uLGET
[3:18:44] zzzz1334: actually 🤓 wr doesnt matter
[3:18:50] ivan_beifong: true, people dont even give arguments haha
[3:18:52] handicapped_cat: akshulllyyyyy
[3:18:53] notfragilee: that bard diff
[3:18:56] Rosharlol: using wr as a metric LULE
[3:18:56] Dutch_van_der_Linde: I think the correct way of phrasing it is that Yone is just not fun to play against, thats why people are mad
[3:18:57] Deceiver_euw: leblanc winrate is nearing sub 46
[3:18:59] dmatsuh: delusional Yone haters
[3:19:01] 3lvis22: by the remuval or hull the champ is fine imo
[3:19:01] dominantfatherfigure: report for unskilled argument
[3:19:01] trqvisss: yone is hard to play correctly
[3:19:02] DarthConstantine13: @candaink he is hard
[3:19:02] Deceiver_euw: how about we talk about the real issue
[3:19:05] debster_lol: renekton lane 1gameinmasterelo
[3:19:07] candaink: @DarthConstantine13 xd
[3:19:08] DonaldMungchi: @Deceiver_euw good
[3:19:10] TomTripping: @Dutch_van_der_Linde but renekton is :D
[3:19:10] StrawberryBursts: akali had even lower win rate at points and she was broken
[3:19:10] used_notebook: !song
[3:19:11] maxelmort: Hullbraker Yone was super degenerate but now he seems fine/weak
[3:19:13] M3T_R3MIX: @Dzukill but wr doesnt mean nothing look trynda wr is below 50 isnt he broken in lane?
[3:19:21] IronTimm: i think yone easy and op but all players too shit BASEDHALT
[3:19:23] candaink: you can just say hes countered by renekton, simple
[3:19:30] Azelyth: yone is easy until you get counterpicked, wich is very easy to do, there's so many toplaners that counter him early and just neutralizes him completely
[3:19:34] TomTripping: yone player opinion :/
[3:19:39] StrawberryBursts: @Dzukill but you also shouldn't tell "it's bad argument" when you conflate what I said and some other dude tho
[3:19:41] periph3ral: irrational arguments are inconsistent by nature
[3:19:43] asesinodeligas: why no flash bard ult??
[3:19:44] DarthConstantine13: @candaink, go complain on reddit about yone while you play your wholesome malphite and rumble
[3:19:46] Daron100: "u are a yone otp" = fiora W againt any argument
[3:19:46] tehazel: Yeah thats a valid point, when he is truly in meta its seen in the winrate aswell
[3:19:46] ivan_beifong: @candaink okay but that argument goes to almost every toplaner
[3:19:49] tuedors: mr dzukill your argument is valid and smart
[3:19:50] blakeee9: playing yone late game when ur the one trying to carry is 1 of the hardest things
[3:19:57] shisui9920: Apparently you can't talk if your a yone player
[3:20:01] reinerseatdown: why is it so hard to lane against yone as jax
[3:20:08] TomTripping: XD
[3:20:09] Thrumbo42: @reinerseatdown jax e blocks q
[3:20:14] zeliorem: is yone better in early, mid or late ?
[3:20:16] Thrumbo42: also outsclaes on side
[3:20:26] DarthConstantine13: MODS start banning them
[3:20:27] candaink: @DarthConstantine13 who says im complaining and i dont use that app, i do have a life
[3:20:33] lunaius: RIOT
[3:20:33] Rosharlol: by default yone is easy to play all you do is auto attack LULE
[3:20:33] ivan_beifong: nice one ability deals half hp
[3:20:35] zzzz1334: ask for opgg MEGALUL
[3:20:38] Daron100: close trade Baseg
[3:20:41] zafirovzz: @droby13 he needs 1 item and that was divine idk bout now
[3:20:43] StrawberryBursts: Yone is hard to play and has some god awful match ups ye
[3:20:44] flag0507: hi dzu u are beatiful
[3:20:44] reinerseatdown: @Thrumbo42 but yone E kites out my E as well
[3:20:47] DarthConstantine13: @candaink, Kappa
[3:20:56] dopemxe: it wont give opgg
[3:21:06] paul227: worth
[3:21:08] paul227: WOOOORTH
[3:21:10] droby13: @reinerseatdown if you engage bad then yes
[3:21:15] The_yoneverse: U R a fkn GM player why would u even argue with ppl? those are leage players anyway
[3:21:15] voltsm_: 5s cc haha
[3:21:16] Azelyth: @reinerseatdown have you thought of holding your E?
[3:21:23] M3T_R3MIX: @Dzukill doesnt ksante have negative wr?
[3:21:25] Nerchhh: not saying he's broken but i think there's a large discrepancy in his winrate due to people's terrible itemization
[3:21:28] TomTripping: fuck it, we ball
[3:21:29] MrButtons5: how is every season jax rumble and renek op its soo boring
[3:21:30] M3T_R3MIX: isnt he broken and simple
[3:21:32] Nerchhh: like there are people that build shiv first on yone
[3:21:36] TomTripping: barack
[3:21:52] paul227: @Dzukill he called you grandmaster
[3:21:54] shisui9920: @TaurusTard not anyone above silver
[3:21:54] paul227: thoughts?
[3:21:56] clRare: @MrButtons5 because riot love seeing them in pro play for some reason
[3:22:01] yurai_who: bring back duo queue
[3:22:01] Thrumbo42: @Thrumbo42 Yeah but Jax E is way lower cooldown than yone E
[3:22:04] paul227: AHHAAHHA
[3:22:09] tehazel: @Dzukill What do you think about yone vs irelia matchup?
[3:22:13] Deceiver_euw: FeelsWeirdMan
[3:22:16] Nerchhh: @TaurusTard you would be surprised lol
[3:22:19] blakeee9: whats bork into rene like?
[3:22:25] swerbyy: hi LuvSign
[3:22:29] periph3ral: this is just the nature of competitive game discourse its pretty much always terrible
[3:22:30] denyxc: @blakeee9 i think its better :d
[3:22:36] yurai_who: bring back duo queue imagine nemesis dzukill duo turbo content
[3:22:42] Daron100: how far have you fallen a challanger reduced to a grandmaster @Dzukill
[3:22:52] dopemxe: @blakeee9 outsclaed by armor

[3:31:15] Epardes: u can only win if he wastes E somehow early on, but if u have traded hp before that, u just guarenteed lose @Dzukill
[3:31:16] romse__: isnt it because he is strong in early game? and you are an scaling champ?
[3:31:21] Drislak: @Dzukill How do you consistently Q his W? Is there some part of the animation that's easy to recognize?
[3:31:31] jesuslukrez: @baoketban123 well i said aswell i didnt said it was empowerd xd
[3:31:34] The_yoneverse: @The_yoneverse I think garen is more brainless , enogh to stomp u atleast uk..
