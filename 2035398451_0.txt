[1:09:48] zerokewl343: @MrPepperJams yeah i was thinking the same thing. i never liked his E ability... low dmg truthfully unless they are on low life so typically you "wait" to use Q until they are low.
[1:09:49] Strydrs: me too myself in the morning
[1:09:52] ForbiddenZen: LOL
[1:09:55] Strydrs: to*
[1:10:24] Strydrs: lane exp secured
[1:10:56] keenxwx: thoughts on new items on shaco?
[1:10:59] zerokewl343: @MrPepperJams An auto attack should never do more dmg than an ability unless its an auto attack style champ... with in reason of course
[1:11:52] MrPepperJams: @zerokewl343 ye unless ahead it's not great dmg, e being single target and not alot of dmg with the cd it has feels meh, point and click is nice i guess tho
[1:12:40] zerokewl343: @MrPepperJams but how many of these newer champs have point and click with way more dmg than shaco e
[1:12:52] MrPepperJams: but idk, feel it can be good ability, just feels lacking compared to others these days
[1:13:13] dudedkdk: @ChaseShaco did u purposefullu dodge lux Q on that gank? :O issnt all here basic ability same cast animation
[1:13:25] ForbiddenZen: @MrPepperJams e should apply some sort of poison or exposed effect to target
[1:13:42] ForbiddenZen: only makes sense a clown assasin using poison
[1:14:14] Tizzlefix: lmao bro i studied ur a build a bit and working like a charm
[1:14:17] MrPepperJams: @zerokewl343 ye that what i mean, it just feels lacking compared to others is all, just needs a little something
[1:14:42] MrPepperJams: @ForbiddenZen ye something like that, isn't it called two shiv poison as well or smth? KEKW
[1:14:55] zerokewl343: @MrPepperJams i feel like if they added a arm or mag pen or both... for X amount of seconds... then maybe
[1:14:57] ForbiddenZen: kekw no poison on a poison aesthetic skill
[1:14:58] Nightbot: KEKW
[1:15:31] MrPepperJams: @zerokewl343 ye there are many options, don't wanna overload it, but just something
[1:15:36] Belock: Or give it two charges, two shiv but can only throw one.
[1:15:38] misthee: make it big for tower
[1:15:39] zerokewl343: exactly
[1:15:56] MrPepperJams: two charges could be interesting actually
[1:16:05] MrPepperJams: riot been adding those recently too
[1:16:07] ForbiddenZen: imagine calling it two shiv and we only get 1
[1:16:25] dudedkdk: @chaseshaco when do you have most fun when AP is meta or AD? :)
[1:16:35] zerokewl343: @MrPepperJams one thing i hate in LOL is that some champs have abilitys that work on towers and some dont... correct me if im wrong.. Darius can use his ?e?   on the tower... but Shen cant use his Q... like wtf
[1:16:41] misthee: xaxaxa
[1:16:54] MadPupp3teer: MadPupp3teer subscribed with Prime. 
[1:17:08] ForbiddenZen: @zerokewl343 yeah darius can auto reset using his ability
[1:17:10] MrPepperJams: @zerokewl343 nahh darius's armor pen works on towers he can't used the e ability cast part on it
[1:17:18] MrPepperJams: oh wait do you mean his w?
[1:17:23] MrPepperJams: his auto reset
[1:17:50] MrPepperJams: he can auto reset the tower but i think it doesn't go on cd or smth
[1:17:53] zerokewl343: i dont know if its his E or not.. i havent play LOL in a minute
[1:18:01] ForbiddenZen: it's his w
[1:18:24] MrPepperJams: yeye he can w the tower but i think it like jax w and doesn't go on cd
[1:18:36] ForbiddenZen: trundle being able to bite tower is just stupid lol
[1:18:53] zerokewl343: but otherwise champs that have abilities that state similiar to ::::  next basic/auto attack does X more dmg::: should not apply to towers unless all of them do.
[1:18:58] MrPepperJams: half fioras kit now works on towers KEKW
[1:19:19] toxihobbies: ohh you change ruin king for lethality second, i did the same last night

[1:19:25] alienag22: U never lose stacks
[1:19:26] scLua: permanent
[1:19:29] Jaxnamikz: not like mej
[1:19:31] zerokewl343: yeah... Jax cant use W on tower... Shen cant use Q... but their are champs who can cast abilities on towers...
[1:19:35] scLua: it's like mejais with no downside
[1:19:40] Ixdex1: no, you just lose the effect until you get another takedown
[1:20:13] ForbiddenZen: U will keep the stack count but u just need to get another takedown in the timer
[1:20:17] ForbiddenZen: 60 seconds i believe
[1:20:18] MrPepperJams: @zerokewl343 jax kinda can, but it just an auto reset, not w dmg and ability has to run out before the cd starts, it's kidna weird

[1:24:04] Danfoerst: Prob flaming each other
[1:24:09] MrPepperJams: did they not make baron stronger or was that a weaker of the 3?
[1:24:23] MadPupp3teer: why bork?

[1:32:10] ToxicClone_: u think profane will get nerved?
[1:32:10] Lacerration: the items are shit at killing anything aside from squishies

[3:02:21] r1_solid: damge taken
[3:02:26] AlienJungle: but since it's %ms, it becomes better with trinity, fleet, etc.
[3:02:27] lliottt: @sirfabs i literally answered you earlier
[3:02:29] ficron1: LDR increased damage against high hp targets works with magic damage too
