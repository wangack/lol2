[0:32:52] navcite: sow e cant flash over it anymore
[0:32:57] antmoose: they were trying to even out the amount each side gets ganked
[0:32:57] EverlastingLich: mirrored?
[0:32:58] Watertoad: red side gets fucked botlane
[0:32:59] GANKERLagann: not symmetrical?
[0:33:01] Balner12: LOL
[0:33:03] R_J______: ???
[0:33:04] Miraikii: symmetrical
[0:33:05] Freuclid: its the mirror red and blue side
[0:33:16] Rosmic: Its to mimic the opposite side of the river not the opposite side of the map
[0:33:20] whip_cwa: its more symetrical now than before lol
[0:33:27] xraIIe: make all sides weakside = profit
[0:33:30] antmoose: because blue/red had higher gank numbers then the other

[0:33:52] Doomyguy: the true island gameplay
[0:33:56] Rosmic: Gives Toplane a harder gank pattern and bot lane an easier gank patterns
[0:34:15] Doomyguy: #4 man ganks at bot again?
[0:34:16] antmoose: top lane is an even bigger island now
[0:34:47] ex1nus: Illaoli is TURBO usless now on top because of size KEKW

[0:35:45] lulumid: @Hell_thing i have fun in league
[0:35:48] Doomyguy: tentacles in middle of lane dont reach
[0:35:48] torakaka: https://youtu.be/ltgvUsXQheQ?si=6NvJLWpZDIoo5M56
[0:35:49] GANKERLagann: walls are too far from lane
[0:35:50] PPPPPPP270: emerald I
[0:35:52] PPPPPPP270: oh no
[0:35:52] Daimos91: the tentacle dont reach bc of the lane walls
[0:35:54] s0ulmusic: Is Emerald after Diamond ?
[0:35:55] thaprinnydood: walls are too wide for here tentacles to reach
[0:35:55] EverlastingLich: imo top lane being so wide makes her tentacles worse
[0:35:56] TicklishTrev: illaoi is not turbo useless....damned crackheads...
[0:35:58] antmoose: illaois winrate dropped by about 6% because since the lane is wider she cant hit people with passive as much
[0:36:01] unabull: No where for passive to spawn top
[0:36:02] Freuclid: there is a spot in the middle of the top lane where her passive tentacles cant reach ANY wall
[0:36:02] GANKERLagann: the tentacles that spawn on walls are too far away to fight around
[0:36:04] NewCristiako: is too open top
[0:36:04] Rosmic: Illaoi is more rough because of the lack of walls but she isnt useless
[0:36:05] O432O: tentacles spawn in narnia
[0:36:09] GANKERLagann: that's what people are saying anyways
[0:36:10] Captain_Boosted: If you want to turn your brain off, Singed is really good right now apparently
[0:36:13] aquadadge: top lane WIDE
[0:36:19] Doomyguy: its sad :(
