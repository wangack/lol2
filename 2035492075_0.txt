[1:09:01] shinsora_: @holybooba that was when the season begin new but now he thinks that you should always go sundred first item

[1:10:11] worldenderaatrox: Why tho somebody explain the antisynergy
[1:10:22] skratch99: @naayil is weak or strong side based on wave state?
[1:10:22] shinsora_: @furydragon1878 sundred and shojin combination for the healing
[1:10:37] Fishfishrun: @Serj_SI dd turns all damage into a physical damage bleed. including maw. so mr damage turns to ad
[1:10:47] chiristos231: Isn't antiheal like really really good in this teamcomp?
[1:10:49] anonimus200002: @worldenderaatrox u dont shield magic dmg bECAUSE IT GOES INTO TRUE FROM dd

[1:11:10] muuyaa__: get well soon @Naayil :DD
[1:11:14] Fishfishrun: yeah true damage not physical
[1:11:19] rzufranklin: i think it might be that with maw u want the shield to pop to get lifesteal while DD delays it and kinda neutralizes the lifesteal effect when ur health is still going down
[1:11:23] erogazino: is this smurf
[1:11:30] holybooba: that nash was stupid
[1:11:47] ecrofkwah: @serj_si while ago they made dd bleed apply on damage taken when you are shielded, so my guess is the part of the magic dmg that would be absorbed by maw is turned into a true dmg bleed instead

[2:54:17] Aarguil: @Aarguil there's a lot of champs apart from assassins that synergies well with it, now they don't bcs they fucked the item, is there something you don't understand
[2:54:22] adrianna_zmora: oh okay, thank u guys for the answer
[2:54:37] Noelletrox: @adrianna_zmora no twitch added thing where u can put it like if u perma someone they cant even watch u
[2:54:49] EduartePaiva: jana seems broken
[2:54:58] Harrimoth: she is
[2:55:08] Maword: i think shes just gapped lol
[2:55:10] Aarguil: if they made rylai's an item that slows only below 50% hp and instead of giving hp it'd give magic pen it would be horrible for singed or morde
[2:55:27] lukewilliam1999: @Aarguil I believe there is still more ad champs capable of building seryldas than ap champs that can build ryllai's so I don't understand what is so unfair.
[2:55:27] Bnadryl: vayne is a teratoma UWU
[2:55:34] kesii: ur like 52% winrate hardstuck and u complain about teammates

[7:30:59] KhaineFDRG: @chillaxingvoid The first auto you deal on an enemy champion crits for 150% of its base damage, and heal you for a flat amount +6% of your missing health. you can repeat that every 6s per champion
[7:31:11] rivulet_mera: which tank item do you recomend vs jax?? as briar iusually go Frozen heart but no HP feels bad
[7:31:22] Diogorb04: @KhaineFDRG The tooltip is actually wrong, it crits for 175% atm
[7:31:32] chillaxingvoid: @chillaxingvoid damn this is interestngly broken . thank you
