[0:42:05] alterkita: That Clip is hard reason why i quit playing adc and then the game entirely
[0:42:08] megutherookie: The thing that annoys me the most while playing ADC is that neither my jgl and my supp understands when I or enemy ADC is stronger. It usually ends with the enemy ADC gets ahead

[0:43:09] rickstrife: I onlly became adc main cause all my friends sucked ass when we did  5s lol
[0:43:10] Jaykeblakk: I wish Samira was still viable in this meta. She's impossible to play now without dying when attempting to ult.
[0:43:29] Silvah: samira is playable tho
[0:43:36] schonjon: Welcome to ADC life, where no matter how far you are, 1 item assassin will 1 shot you
[0:43:39] chauchee: is triforce an actual thing on jhin now?
[0:43:41] CoobsLoL: true i didnt think about that
[0:44:00] CoobsLoL: is it bad for those dive comps tho
[0:44:07] Jaykeblakk: @Silvah Do you happen to know of high elo players I could watch that play her? I don't understand how to play her without getting killed by their assassins every teamfight.
[0:44:07] megutherookie: Solo q as a ADC or supp is a nightmare
[0:44:16] Jaykeblakk: I don't think I've ulted once this season as Samira in a teamfight.
[0:44:22] mystdemon: YOOO I have rewatched this clip like 10 times it is so relatable it just pleases me to listen to it
[0:44:33] huywho: I have not seen Samira at all this season
[0:44:33] Silvah: @Jaykeblakk a pro adc player called jackspektra plays her quite often
[0:44:36] uwu4167: would renata be nice in this match up ?
[0:44:43] Jaykeblakk: @Silvah Thank you!
[0:44:46] CoobsLoL: i sent that clip to the discord waiting to hear their thoughts
[0:44:51] Silvah: np
[0:44:53] Lichyness: ADC is strong and determined by supp/jg
[0:45:04] megutherookie: @lichyness definitely agreed
[0:45:05] bigbrother0012: Supp is worst role
[0:45:06] alterkita: ADC is just very dependent on your team. So in solo q ADC is coin flip role
[0:45:07] kittensheep: how is this worse then top
[0:45:08] mystdemon: and that is why other roles call us crybabies
[0:45:12] Silvah: samira is his most played adc this season actually
[0:45:12] huywho: @lichyness if your JG and supp play for you
[0:45:18] purgatorlupy: hey taco, I was watching the video on the new channel, I was thinking u would post videos without edit, wouldn't it be easier if the new channel got videos without edit?
[0:45:18] mystdemon: they only notice when we are strong
[0:45:28] nitzaboss: adc is fun and complex and i love it and i wanna perform but for the love of god some support players have no plan
[0:45:30] Lichyness: hence why its easy to be "carried" as adc
[0:45:36] kittensheep: Clueless I see
[0:45:37] Finsby_: Exactly. ADC is strtong, but it needs a team that enables you to play - which doesnt exist in soloqueue
[0:45:49] bigbrother0012: Top is just farming stimulater
[0:45:51] Silvah: @Jaykeblakk he only really picks her in low cc comps tho
[0:46:10] megutherookie: ADC is strong but one wrong step can be a mistake that leads to lost game
[0:46:11] Klony99: @IKeepItTaco You played Top offstream, right? I remember that.
[0:46:15] Lichyness: ive been considering fully swapping to main mid with jhin :T
[0:46:17] Jaykeblakk: @IKeepItTaco Could you please paste a link to that video in chat? I'd like to watch it again.
[0:46:29] Silvah: like if you play samira vs alistar its kinda unplayable
[0:46:43] nitzaboss: that's why i main vayne and not the role xdd
[0:46:58] paodeformal9: yeah i also main adc and when i get filled top i win more than on my own role xD (master tier)
[0:47:02] Lichyness: lighter editing is good
[0:47:21] Lichyness: u dont wanna throw an entire 20 min game no cuts in in this era of attention span
[0:47:28] purgatorlupy: got it <3 i'm loving the video tho
[0:47:46] bizarredoll69: You have a second channel?
[0:48:01] brido14: hey taco any suggestion to get  used to unlocked cam?
[0:48:04] AESTHETHICC666: thats eboy xerath bro xd
[0:48:18] bigbrother0012: Lol
[0:48:21] Finsby_: wait, do non scripters play xerath?
[0:48:26] bigbrother0012: Its him

[0:48:48] Klony99: Doxxed
[0:48:51] purgatorlupy: i was spamming jhin in the last season but was too hard to play   as weakside so now im only aphelios xD
[0:48:51] Lichyness: what an unflattering image
[0:48:57] mirkata1016: Bro needs a jaw transplant
[0:48:58] elitepoopotter: nah they prob send that image to distract chat

[0:50:38] InkyBabaYaga: YOOO wassup
[0:50:40] megutherookie: What will you pick if jhin will be banned?
[0:51:17] Debetterest: the fact that every single person sits thru all of champ select just for someone to dodge everytime
[0:51:22] ospylac11: if i spam jhin in solo queue in bronze elo can i escape ? (i'm jhin main btw)

[0:52:02] winthertm: what do you think of jhin in s14
[0:52:14] brido14: @bigbrother0012 yeah but not with long range champs like jhin
[0:52:15] Omni_Grasp: @bigbrother0012 you should be slapped
[0:52:16] SNail_B0at: pls dont 5x ad me 1 or 2 is enough
[0:52:34] bigbrother0012: @omni_grasp D:
[0:52:40] MF_FADED: I litteraly only play jhin in soloq bronze and i was hard stuck iron and got out
[0:52:52] ospylac11: @MF_FADED what elo are you now ?
[0:52:54] Omni_Grasp: focus on csing
[0:52:55] megutherookie: @bigbrother0012 it's not bad but gives little information
[0:53:03] Omni_Grasp: if your below gold you prob just dont cs lol
[0:53:06] MF_FADED: @MF_FADED brozne 3
[0:53:36] Sumiko88: you can make it to gold easy with jhin, but after that you need to have teammates who know how to play with him
[0:53:55] ospylac11: @Sumiko88 i see
[0:54:01] bigbrother0012: Type it
[0:54:06] ospylac11: i just want to get out of bronze
[0:54:14] bigbrother0012: He needs to know the truth
[0:54:14] ospylac11: i see that jhin can get you to gold ez
[0:54:39] AESTHETHICC666: what do you thnk bout ap mf support taco
[0:54:42] shady_basement: who are your top 3 supports to pair with jhin
[0:55:00] bigbrother0012: 1v2 more like 1v3
[0:55:15] VioletRvn: as a xayah main i can confirm :)
[0:55:54] bigbrother0012: Is vex good again?
[0:55:58] illegalpotato7: what about zyra players?

[0:57:07] psanti: taco can you show runes pls?

[0:57:27] psanti: ty
[0:57:37] Allerion_SE: Harvest over Fleet now?
[0:57:50] InkyBabaYaga: I remember i banned yuumi supp tho they were hovering over it cause our adc picked Jhin. We won ofc but they were mad as hell.
[0:58:18] bigbrother0012: What's the dog doing
[0:58:20] trapp_m: sup taco
[0:58:37] adeleesh: is crit not viable on jhin anymore?
[0:59:04] megutherookie: @inkybabayaga  yuumi seems kinda useless for each ADC after changes rn. She'll eventually move to jgl or top
[0:59:17] Xalrentaru: @adeleesh crit Jhin wasn't nerfed, it's that everyone hates building crit adc's and lethality is VERY good right now so people are taking advantage of that fact.
[0:59:40] bigbrother0012: Bro got stuned for 2 min
[1:00:15] LearnSomethingNewEveryday: SeemsGood
[1:00:30] adeleesh: riot doesnt care about adcs a long time now they changed all items added so much more overtuned mages and we got a terminus
[1:00:43] mystdemon: I tell that to my supports too hehe
[1:01:19] NapNapoleon: I think lee was running away and trind was on zed already
[1:01:32] Mulscolbo: why some adc are building the item support?
[1:02:10] Xalrentaru: supp item gives adc more gold per minute than it takes away if the supp also uses it properly
[1:02:16] NapNapoleon: Trind was on zed, he was pretty much blocking the way zed had to run to survive, which would open the path for lee. I think that's why he got impatient.
[1:02:37] NapNapoleon: Not saying he made the right choice, but that's why he got impatient
[1:02:56] ScarlyScars: hey taco! good afternoon
[1:04:20] AwesomeInABox: everytime ive gotten yuumi sup recently ive been dived by their jg+botlane. i only lost one of those games so thats something
[1:04:24] frankliang: Wokege
[1:04:46] foodman_steve: New support item give 20g to any minion that is killed yeah? So why is Ali taking seige minion (reducing from 50/60g to 20) when he can get caster minions which goes from 14 to 20, gaining 6g?
[1:04:46] NapNapoleon: UNLUCKY
[1:04:50] SNail_B0at: LUL LUL
[1:04:51] niekoss: what is you doing
[1:05:36] AwesomeInABox: it doesnt reduce its instead for the minion gold. the support gains 20g instead of w.e the minion's gold was
[1:05:50] lethalbonsai: hi taco
[1:05:51] AwesomeInABox: so its just there to help last hit
[1:06:37] bigbrother0012: Is literally joever

[1:07:13] AwesomeInABox: its been happening a lot to me recently
[1:07:17] bigbrother0012: Mid is safest lane
[1:07:38] AwesomeInABox: my support just fucking off even when we arent behind
[1:08:14] AwesomeInABox: like i had a support just go roam early after we got a kill then making me miss 10 cs cause i had to sit under turret from their botlane
[1:08:25] lethalbonsai: @ikeepittaco when its good to go support item ?
[1:08:29] bigbrother0012: Rammus emote GoatEmotey
[1:08:29] NapNapoleon: You're not landing those W today, jesus.
[1:09:07] bigbrother0012: Taco can u play mid next game?
[1:09:41] Telekinesis_User: :D
[1:10:11] lethalbonsai: on what situaion is good to run support item ?

[1:11:32] lethalbonsai: i feel you taco
[1:11:39] lethalbonsai: op op black screen
[1:12:33] Xalrentaru: something I've started doing to middling success is just following my supp's roam and letting the bot turrets drop, not like I can stop a 3man dive if that's what they want to do, so may as well have some fun team fighting.
[1:12:35] NapNapoleon: da feet
[1:12:38] MetalFire23x: go next
[1:12:40] MetalFire23x: refresh
[1:12:48] lethalbonsai: taco on shat situation is good to run sup item ?

[1:13:01] beckita: We still working on getting Masters?
[1:13:18] beckita: oh ye
[1:13:27] Xalrentaru: Ali was kinda unique.
[1:14:58] lethalbonsai: taco ignoring my question
[1:15:10] VeinF1: wow

[1:16:20] VeinF1: be in his prospective
[1:16:20] megutherookie: Each time I had Ali support they had tunel vision and they only went in.
[1:16:22] bigbrother0012: Bro league isn't a team game
[1:16:23] InkyBabaYaga: what happened at the zed wukong situation?
[1:16:31] bigbrother0012: Kappa
[1:16:55] jhinxed1: you got this Taco, shit happens
[1:17:09] purgatorlupy: how the last game end? i got see work stuff did saw how it end
[1:17:16] lethalbonsai: so as far there is lane support its good to run it
[1:17:21] Xalrentaru: Well if Taco is playing mid maybe he'll be allowed to have a supp trying to play around him instead of the bot laner Kappa
[1:17:27] bigbrother0012: @purgatorlupy bad
[1:18:02] lethalbonsai: idk but the roaming supp is like a 50/50

[1:22:27] bigbrother0012: Lb is so annoying to play against
[1:22:37] lethalbonsai: lb is boring lane fr
[1:22:37] fevgatos_live: i was waiting for the flash FOUR
[1:22:46] lethalbonsai: not as much as vs syndra but boring
[1:22:48] ravendamarosh: Taco, do you think Jhin could be a viable SUpport champ?
[1:23:06] fevgatos_live: rip that fat wave bot lane
[1:23:29] Ninawai: is there any situation for ad jhin or lethality is just better overall
[1:23:45] ethiaaa: and if you deal no dmg is your fault
[1:23:46] bigbrother0012: U don't level e? Huhh
[1:23:55] lethalbonsai: @bigbrother0012 yeah

[1:24:39] ttg10: your playlist is always goated
[1:24:41] lethalbonsai: lvl 3 e is useless
[1:24:47] megutherookie: ADC depends on support in early game and if the lane is lost adc is hopeless while supp will just roam somewhere else. Then it ends with team blaming ADC being useless
[1:24:47] bigbrother0012: Kk
[1:25:05] purgatorlupy: @lethalbonsai some times i think get the e lvl 3 can be viable
[1:25:17] lethalbonsai: @megutherookie fax cuz supp is not gold based role
[1:25:29] itserklol: Hi taco, how are the games
[1:25:32] lethalbonsai: @purgatorlupy on bot yeah

[1:44:12] kalmar1997: OH NO GRAVES KS HER KILL XD
[1:44:15] FURIA_Frostbyte: Seems kinda obvious to use Vi's ult to cc a target. Is Vi just playing selfishly, or does she not know what she's doing?

[2:11:13] dark_master72: Is mid jhin better than top?
[2:11:25] manasar: Quinn will probably start roaming soon

[2:13:34] kheanurose: flaming me wont make you undie to dumb mistakes LUL
[2:13:52] Klony99: But Taco SAID AS MUCH. He literally said he's learning the matchup... Yeah the mistakes are preventable.... IF you learned the matchup...
[2:13:55] OmegaBasedEarwig: Send opgg though guy

[2:14:15] rise9822: My man taking a violent path today
[2:14:21] Klony99: @kheanurose You're backseat gaming for no reason. He said he's making mistakes. Obviously those are preventable?
[2:14:23] Dillmann: why didnt I play when that inflation happened ikeepitRAREHANDS
[2:14:38] shogunzzz1: don’t listen to him Taco. He’s just a bb.
[2:14:48] bigbrother0012: Woke up and choosed violence
[2:14:50] hughhh_g_rection181: The easiest way to counter Rumble is to just outscale him, legit
[2:14:55] maskedman2808: tbh he made mistakes but his laning not bad. CS pretty good, he didnt lose any turret plates tho.
[2:14:56] hughhh_g_rection181: He's insanely op in lane
[2:15:15] megutherookie: Taco admitted he made mistakes. That should be praised since many league players don't do that usually. Taco also fixed it. He's not a machine. He can make mistakes
[2:15:22] Creccio: How is Zeri feeling yall, want to learn her but dont know if she is doomed
[2:15:24] StellarPioneers: Pretty sure Vladdd's comment was directed at the backseater
[2:15:25] Cosmoalert3105: @hughhh_g_rection181 Outscale rumble in this patch in impossible

[2:16:08] Soupman456: @coreyelle hi elle lurkk
[2:16:11] arcxanna: there are no mistakes in high elo, the game is decided by which teams gets bored and ffs first
[2:16:13] RickyTheRainFrog: @coreyelle @Soupman456 @nyxionite catRose

[2:16:41] StellarPioneers: @winkyy11 Taco's choice of words could be better, but he's absolutely right. That guy is not thinking like a Masters player, so it's very unlikely he's actually Masters
[2:16:42] dailith5: ups
[2:16:50] OmegaBasedEarwig: Does taco ban or timeout backseat gamers?
[2:16:52] coreyelle: hi @soupman456 and @rickytherainfrog netherimHearts ikeepitFLOWER
[2:17:04] StellarPioneers: @PCEsJourney plus, Taco is focusing on the game more than phrasing
[2:17:08] malikhulia13: and Aatrox casually healed 400 with one auto xdd
[2:17:21] malikhulia13: nothing to see here guys, move along
[2:17:23] kuxalul: and 25 free ad from item
[2:17:44] kalmar1997: @malikhulia13 it was probably from his item
[2:17:49] sarah_luvuwu: what skin is that
[2:17:55] xch4kr4x: SF
[2:18:15] hughhh_g_rection181: Against Rumble i'd go Boots of Swiftnes because his overheated auto attacks are his 2nd biggest source of dmg, and for him to auto attack you he has to slow you with his E, but with boots of swiftness that's a bit harder
[2:18:22] flux3003: ziggs HUH

[2:19:15] bigbrother0012: Rip teemo
[2:19:26] StellarPioneers: why the hell would he path into lane that way, that was so obviously a death trap
[2:19:28] hughhh_g_rection181: And honestly, ask Ziggs to side vs Rumble, Rumble can't do anything against artillery mages and control mages
[2:19:29] shogunzzz1: why does Striker take heal every game? am I missing something?
[2:19:31] maskedman2808: sunder op
[2:19:35] bigbrother0012: Tf that healing
[2:19:44] Fraterscorpio: I never do mistakes in Gold 😄
[2:20:08] MimiBonnyBun: Aatrox's ult buffs Sky's healing?

[2:42:15] Creccio: @IKeepItTaco im a Jhin enjoyer, what would be another ADC to learn so in case of ban/pick
[2:42:28] Pawskal: adc is ungratful atm every ap caster / tank 1shotting almost every adc only way is Maw to survive by any chance :/
[2:42:31] MysticMachia: Would you say it's more worth to play a different role other than ADC in lower elo until you get higher in order to have a better chance at getting a good support
[2:42:44] Zoldyako: Playing adc this season is being a terrible experience, do you have any advice to play with bad supports? Because I don't want to switch roles cause the queue time is too long
[2:42:46] zmat24: Do you think junglers are busted this patch just as every other patch or is it in a better state than in the past?
[2:42:47] lesles0203: thx
[2:43:02] lethalbonsai: @zoldyako bro playing adc has been terrible since season 6
[2:43:05] abdelrahman3055: that's 8 hours away lmao
[2:43:12] WizardPug: adcs with control imo
[2:43:15] ChRiSMKoz: hello
[2:43:24] gloww1337: @lethalbonsai No it hasn't. Wtf lol
[2:43:34] MysticMachia: MF or who? I didn't hear the last one
[2:43:34] lethalbonsai: it has been like that
[2:43:35] Sosoalsaeed: So what is the first item to build for jhin? Sorry haven't been keeping up much with meta and I just opened stream
[2:43:41] BlackCl0ud: it's fine playing adc if you don't mind mental health lol
[2:43:42] lethalbonsai: ive been playing leage since day 1
[2:43:43] Fraterscorpio: Opinions on the double enchanter botlane meta? 😄
[2:43:43] abdelrahman3055: it's 11 hours sry
[2:43:46] arcxanna: @MysticMachia bro cant get a good support in masters, what you talking about
[2:43:48] abdelrahman3055: intersting
[2:43:50] Creccio: @IKeepItTaco im a Jhin enjoyer, what would be another ADC to learn so in case of ban/pick?
[2:43:57] Zoldyako: @lethalbonsai I can imagine, but I only started playing it late 2023, and this season has being a nightmare for some reason
[2:44:00] matsosdm: today somebody stole my jhin who was called taco so i played tristana my supp inted I won bot but lost cause no mid and jg. He could play a lot more aggressive but he played smart anyway I hope he is here now watching 👋👋
[2:44:06] NomadNoah: I've been bouncing around other lanes, Jhin is fun but it's hard when support is such a huge proportion of your relevance. Maybe it's time for the mid Jhin lifestyle
[2:44:09] lesles0203: your getting master
[2:44:09] lethalbonsai: if you want to train mental become adc player
[2:44:13] BlackCl0ud: blitz can't execute you
[2:44:18] MysticMachia: Aww thank you, it's dreadful to play Jhin in lower elo right now, too many autofill supports
[2:44:23] lethalbonsai: or you go adc cuz you already got strong mental
[2:44:43] MysticMachia: aaa*
[2:44:44] lethalbonsai: taco support ??!
[2:44:45] Fraterscorpio: Doesnt seraphine stomp senna this meta?
[2:45:04] abdelrahman3055: @lethalbonsai he started the game as adc actually
[2:45:10] abdelrahman3055: supp*
[2:45:13] StellarPioneers: @IKeepItTaco I'm building my items list ('cause recommended are kinda weird atm). Would you build both Grudge and Cyclosword or would you pick only one or the other?
[2:45:14] megutherookie: Sera supp is weak rn. She's better apc
[2:45:19] InkyBabaYaga: im back and i bring good news

[2:45:34] matsosdm: @mysticmachia yea i lost 4 times today not only because of supps but team was bad as well
[2:45:39] lethalbonsai: thats what i do when im tired
[2:45:46] MysticMachia: @matsosdm so relatable
[2:45:52] gloww1337: @matsosdm Did you play good... ?
[2:45:56] xch4kr4x: @lethalbonsai at this point I play ADC because I've invested to much of my time in this role, that and for that 1 in 10 games that you aare actually allowed to play
[2:46:00] Fraterscorpio: @megutherookie Like Sera/sona or Sera/Soraka isnt weak

[2:52:12] theverti_: who would win in a fight jesus vs sonic?
[2:52:21] megutherookie: What is worse? Farming jgl or jgl that don't look on wave status and gank anyway?
[2:52:29] Junglebear1: @flab1os i guess not
[2:53:10] xch4kr4x: @megutherookie factual that second one destroy gamestates and think that isn't their fault
[2:53:23] StellarPioneers: watching this kai'sa farm hurts me
[2:54:37] EGN_Flea: it is so easy to killl senna
[2:54:39] midknightcc: @PCEsJourney It hurts us all
[2:54:46] megutherookie: @xch4kr4x that's what I was thinking. Since EU jgls are agressive true but they sometimes overcommit
[2:54:53] xch4kr4x: ikr
[2:55:32] StellarPioneers: so much for "dw kai'sa, you don't need to tilt"
[2:55:39] xch4kr4x: I lost count the amount of jgs that come bot when I have 2/3 stacked under my tower

[2:57:13] kalmar1997: team gap
[2:57:17] Kp2700: wow black Alistar
[2:57:33] sarphee: @Roostmaster was just thinking the same ol
[2:57:36] sarphee: lol
[2:57:54] Wolverine023: Very ambitious play by Kali lol
[2:58:09] JackSkalliov: joever
[2:58:32] Roostmaster: People play literally the second strongest meta ADC and tilt so often so that they never have to improve at the game
[2:58:43] EdgePoz: is this aram on bot lane?
[2:58:51] Roostmaster: ARAB
[2:58:53] Roostmaster: Wait
[2:59:05] sarphee: @Roostmaster  BLUBBERS
[2:59:18] easterNN: thoughts on titanic hydra on jhin?
[2:59:33] megutherookie: @roostmaster people following meta usually have the mindset that picking champ itself will win them a game
[2:59:37] JackSkalliov: I HEARD MY NAME
[2:59:39] sadlaik: ikeepitCUPID
[2:59:45] Roostmaster: "Local Birdbrain Finds Out Why You Don't Abbreviate Everything"

[3:00:02] montezuma03: on the man
[3:00:08] Ninawai: that's crazy
[3:00:09] Roostmaster: Kaisa players are literally crabs in a bucket
[3:00:09] JackSkalliov: Least idiotic Kai'Sa player
[3:00:30] Roostmaster: They drag eachother and themselves down so much so that they can crutch
[3:00:49] SuedeCroc: what if Ninja had a low taper fade
[3:00:58] SuedeCroc: qtpTHINKING
[3:01:00] Roostmaster: L m a o
[3:01:05] StellarPioneers: what elo is this? Like I understand getting autofilled adc, but how is she this bad at decision making?
[3:01:15] Roostmaster: LMAO
[3:01:19] AwesomeInABox: you have to play a little psycho as kaisa to get ahead early
[3:01:20] StellarPioneers: no fucking way
[3:01:25] Roostmaster: Yes way
[3:01:36] 6_snickerdoodle_9: me when delusional strimmer thinks jhin is good again :0
[3:01:38] StellarPioneers: how is that person adc main
[3:01:48] Roostmaster: "Just CS and kite, it will get you to masters" but unironic
[3:01:51] Junglebear1: niceee
[3:01:54] JackSkalliov: HOLY
[3:02:04] m2o0: Taco senna too clean
[3:02:14] StellarPioneers: @Roostmaster she can't even CS tho, that's the worst part
[3:02:16] NapNapoleon: KEKW

[3:02:29] m2o0: Viktor's thx xdd
[3:02:32] Serccubus: that hurt my soul
[3:02:35] JackSkalliov: I swear every Senna player steals my kills on purpose like this
[3:02:42] AwesomeInABox: what does jarvan even do if he doesnt gank 3 times before level 6
[3:02:43] JackSkalliov: Greedy bastards all of them
[3:02:48] kalmar1997: well i mean xd you should let that kill for viktor but probably you know better :P
[3:02:55] SomeDudeNamedThaz: ali with the save 👏
[3:03:01] furinaroxyheart: enemy jarvan lives on lanes meanwhile team jarvan disco dances with the camps.
[3:03:01] SuedeCroc: jarvan prolly only jelqmaxxes instead of girthmaxxing qtpNLT qtpNLT qtpNLT
[3:03:05] manasar: Why does he keep ultim Kalista? The one champ that can walk out of his ult
[3:03:08] Roostmaster: So many people are like "man why do my teammates suck"
[3:03:09] ByTheElements: @kalmar1997 games like these senna can carry
[3:03:19] Roostmaster: Blame content creators who aren't shared
[3:03:20] peshecito: Rumble is losing his mind too :'D
[3:03:33] kalmar1997: @ByTheElements i know this champion is crazy but viktor is strong too

[3:03:50] YunhoeeAteez: TACOOOO CUTIEEEE HOW U DOING
[3:03:53] Roostmaster: You'll have people who have amazing actual gameplay, but have a fucking sugar-glass mental
[3:04:07] Fightin4Fun: Viktor E afterburn was about to proc, wasn't it?
[3:04:07] Roostmaster: So you never see the good gameplay

[3:04:44] kostakis28: you r before that
[3:05:00] midknightcc: Singed with the assist lol
[3:05:05] ByTheElements: @kostakis28 second wave doesn't really do damage til 3-4 items tbh
[3:05:06] Roostmaster: This vik is kinda schnasty with it
[3:05:16] kalmar1997: senna in late game is fucking disgusting champion xd

[3:10:44] Ninawai: who is the most op champ this season
[3:11:18] Roostmaster: Any assassin who can build Cyclosword
[3:11:19] kalmar1997: MF is also super strong
[3:11:23] HNOSTORM: @ninawai inflation
[3:11:30] Roostmaster: MF is always strong tho
[3:11:43] Roostmaster: Fanta mentos or something
[3:11:43] kalmar1997: and all APs with stormsurge

[3:12:39] YunhoeeAteez: cope!
[3:12:49] R_a_n__: Honestly every time I check Kai'sa builds it seems the meta is some new messed up random selection of items
[3:12:54] megutherookie: Kaisa players usually wait for support to set up the kill and then spam everything they have
[3:12:57] EdgePoz: thats good good it calls : walking ward
[3:12:59] EdgePoz: :D
[3:13:03] grey_shygguy: grey_shygguy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months!

[3:14:48] Roostmaster: Unironically jg
[3:14:50] kostakis28: oh nvm
[3:15:06] itserklol: Naw supp unironically 1v9s the role if they know roam timers
[3:15:29] Roostmaster: Okay, 'op role' changes depending on elo bracket
[3:15:31] treshods: Ammm sorry but who's the new supp?

[3:16:05] Roostmaster: Gold-diamond, it's jg
[3:16:18] YunhoeeAteez: oohhh ur so intentionally playing support
[3:16:22] demonminer3: wonder if i'll get an overaggressive senna player who counterpicks themselves hard, or a nautilus who hides behind me instead of trying to trade or peel
[3:16:23] Roostmaster: Diamond-masters, it's probably bot/supp
[3:16:46] Roostmaster: GM plus is literally just "who plays around jgs better"
[3:17:04] whitesnakegg: Build crit never more?
[3:17:07] Roostmaster: Top is always like 2nd/3rd
[3:17:08] Kp2700: but it was team diff tbh
[3:17:19] Kp2700: I could have bet alicopter @ikeepittaco

[3:17:29] Junglebear1: Bardven
[3:17:32] YunhoeeAteez: this senna is mysterious

[3:21:00] Roostmaster: Senna's are either "I play around my timers" or "I am a cannon minion with a heal"
[3:21:02] Van0K: This Senna is 1v2
[3:21:02] StellarPioneers: holy shit this Senna is cracked
[3:21:03] itserklol: You should try going double supp item this game

[3:21:33] Roostmaster: BOOTS
[3:21:37] Roostmaster: BOOOOOOTS
[3:21:40] maskedman2808: na bot cant deal with draven. Luckily senna is not from na

[3:21:48] raidlegend49: Why do you by support item?
[3:21:50] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[3:21:54] xch4kr4x: supp item?
[3:21:59] goodmell0d: wait why are u doing sup  items ?
[3:22:10] M4kshan: because sup item stacking is broken rn
[3:22:11] itserklol: ANEM0N3 was their previous name
[3:22:17] Junglebear1: [][][][]
[3:22:23] demonminer3: @raidlegend49 extra vision, gold gen, it's kind of a thing people are doing till riot patches it out
[3:22:28] maskedman2808: they prob chinese or korean characters.
[3:22:32] NapNapoleon: HE KNOWS
[3:22:40] peshecito: They know, they are so cool
[3:22:58] Littledc: double support items are so broken
[3:23:14] xch4kr4x: but don't you get the penalty for farming with supp item
[3:23:14] demonminer3: and you guys have secured vision together
[3:24:01] juletta1_: easy
[3:24:01] come4hell: is it really that strong double support item?
[3:24:04] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[3:24:07] vsmilotic: draven KEKW
[3:24:08] Roostmaster: Yeah
[3:24:08] demonminer3: @come4hell yes
[3:24:09] NapNapoleon: Senna ghost
[3:24:14] thRaiden4: draven got tilted a lot
[3:24:15] thRaiden4: xD
[3:24:16] Nightbot: XD
[3:24:17] Roostmaster: Least Tilted Draven
[3:24:29] ramisaffour: draven gonna sell items now
[3:24:39] maskedman2808: it was all bard and ignite. Draven didnt do shit there
[3:24:39] ramisaffour: and buy 5 zeal
[3:24:42] m2o0: Why supp item?
[3:24:48] demonminer3: draven gonna go mobis and moonplates now

[3:25:18] thRaiden4: omg they going to cry
[3:25:19] thRaiden4: this night
[3:25:25] YunhoeeAteez: missing eveRITHINGGGG
[3:25:41] chucassss: ugh, thats a shame, ur abusing the double support item
[3:25:55] YunhoeeAteez: @chucassss anything for LP
[3:25:57] orvirith: strong tomato
[3:26:01] hiimjesus01: can you explain the support item?
[3:26:02] YunhoeeAteez: supp items are broken
[3:26:05] leanconsumer76: @IKeepItTaco just tuned to the stream what is up with the support item? doesnt that reduce gold income?
[3:26:17] ender115: imagine playing to win xD
[3:26:22] m2o0: Why supp item tho?Anyone ?
[3:26:23] midknightcc: @leanconsumer76 It ends up paying for itself
[3:26:31] Klony99: "Shit you're abusing Crit items on Tryndamere, what a shame" said nobody ever.
[3:26:34] leanconsumer76: @midknightcc ooh doest it?
[3:26:42] YunhoeeAteez: @hiimjesus01 supp items r broken, the gold nerf isnt bad, so u gain more gold than lose and u get the broken supp item
[3:27:04] R_a_n__: Bro flashed into W
[3:27:05] midknightcc: @leanconsumer76 T1 even did it in the lck today
[3:27:11] chucassss: yes its a problem cus its an unintended interaction, riot shouldve hotfixed it immediately, the insane part is that T1 could even play it in esports and they allowed it so now its mainstream
[3:27:32] demonminer3: @chucassss great...
[3:27:35] leanconsumer76: @midknightcc i see ty for explaining
[3:27:48] gloww1337: @chucassss Lol... ? They even abuse the double support item in the new season what's the problem... ?
[3:27:55] SgtActionAndy: its not a big bug like neeko being a literal tower and onehitting everything
[3:28:01] SgtActionAndy: its a small thing evrey bit can do
[3:28:07] SgtActionAndy: *every bot
[3:28:11] YunhoeeAteez: ill shamelessly keep abusing it with sera
[3:28:12] YunhoeeAteez: LMAOO
[3:28:17] Klony99: @chucassss If it was unintended and game breaking, that would have been fixed as you just said.
[3:28:25] carlostoon: shame? i call it get LP
[3:28:39] Klony99: This is a competition, guys. If everyone else is abusing the system, you have to do the same to stay competitive.
[3:28:43] gloww1337: @IKeepItTaco If you got a brain you should abuse it lmao, like everyone else... XD
[3:28:43] chucassss: @Klony99 surely riot doesnt make mistakes
[3:28:54] hydranjia: how does this even work? i thought there was a penalty for farming with supp item??
[3:28:54] demonminer3: @chucassss Clueless
[3:28:59] Klony99: @chucassss Surely it's not the player's responsisbility to account for Riots mistakes. :D
[3:29:14] carlostoon: use the system is not a shame.
[3:29:22] chucassss: it is, yet the league community always abuses bugs instead of avoid it
[3:29:25] manasar: Honestly. The support item duo is kinda nice as Adc have more wards
[3:29:29] Klony99: Big L take.
[3:29:41] demonminer3: @chucassss we have to abuse bugs, or riot wont fix them
[3:29:41] ender115: lmfaooo
[3:29:56] ender115: imagine playing in a way that is best to win
[3:29:59] chucassss: thats some weird logic
[3:30:00] peetzaaaa: i really dont get the hate for people playing meta, why would you not want to increase your chances of winning
[3:30:00] ender115: crazy concept
[3:30:19] Klony99: @chucassss Dude if we wouldn't we'd lose ELO. This game isn't about honor, it's about being good at the game. Riot doesn't fix their shit, so their shit is part of the game now. That's just how it is. If FIFA introduces 3 balls to the game, not using them to score goals isn't "winning".
[3:30:22] StellarPioneers: bro this botlane is getting my adrenaline pumped
[3:30:25] Silvah: @Klony99 well it was unintended which is why they're gonna change it
[3:30:28] ender115: i simply craft my builds so that they have less chance of winning
[3:30:30] carlostoon: the game reward for winning not for playing " legal"
[3:30:44] Klony99: @Silvah Then disable the item or revert the change. It's not a bug, it's an unfixed interaction.
[3:30:44] soggy4047: Id want lilia to touch me
[3:30:47] soggy4047: I mean what
[3:30:52] carlostoon: HAHAHA
[3:31:00] tufabz: why not collector second? sorry if you already explained just joined the stream
[3:31:02] demonminer3: @Klony99 but they didnt. and we, the players, cant. so we use it
[3:31:11] Silvah: @Klony99 riot only does that if they think its gamebreaking enough
[3:31:12] chucassss: allright so by yalls logic using the tahm kench global e bug that existed, is also fair, same for poppy global q, same for xerath global q, thats all fair to use?
[3:31:14] Klony99: @Klony99 If Jungle camps would suddenly give 300 gold every time you clear them, would you stop clearing jungle every game to be fair?
[3:31:27] ender115: Yes gigachad
[3:31:28] chucassss: tahm w
[3:31:42] Silvah: @Klony99 I dont play jungle FrogO
[3:31:45] demonminer3: @chucassss no. but we use it till riot does something about it
[3:31:46] Klony99: @chucassss If you don't get banned for using it it's fair.
[3:31:48] Ninawai: when to get the supp item if you're supp
[3:31:54] DCjungler: what support upgrade is that
[3:32:07] demonminer3: @demonminer3 if riot doesnt give a shit, then it's not a problem
[3:32:07] Klony99: @Silvah My man don't be intellectually dishoneset, you know full well if a jungle camp gave 300 gold you'd steal every camp you could get away with.
[3:32:15] Silvah: I already steal every camp
[3:32:25] Klony99: SEE. D:
[3:32:28] Gardarski: Is it worth for me to learn jhin. isn't adc a hellscape rn
[3:32:28] StellarPioneers: @DCjungler looks like Solari Locket, I think it's the one that gives a shield at low hp
[3:32:33] Silvah: but I never said anything about things being fair or not tho
[3:32:51] Equinimitys: oh i remember this viego from yesterday
[3:32:57] giorgos_kolok: a
[3:32:58] Klony99: All good Silvah but that was the conversation. Someone said it's "a shame" Taco abuses the "unintended interaction".
[3:33:05] Ninawai: @DCjungler no, is jsut a shield that breaks when hit and slows enemies in an area, crown + randuin
[3:33:07] Klony99: Like bruh... It's still in the game, why would I pass up on free gold?
[3:33:10] johnadam131994: You are the only guy that can make jhin support work. How??
[3:33:22] chucassss: damn, this community really does anything for a drop of elo
[3:33:22] omnitrix925: @johnadam131994 its jhin adc
[3:33:27] omnitrix925: double sup item is broken
[3:33:40] demonminer3: @johnadam131994 jhin support is playable. also, he;'s actually playing adc jhin. also, he's just that good
[3:33:48] Silvah: @Klony99 oh Im not using the double sup item tech myself
[3:33:50] ender115: bro stop being a clown lmao
[3:33:55] Gardarski: lafd
[3:33:59] ender115: ofc people will use the most effective tactics
[3:34:02] speizcraft: but taco you are indeed a funny lad
[3:34:04] ender115: its how comp works
[3:34:08] Yune4Capura: hey taco and chat ikeepitLOVERBOI
[3:34:22] kostanco: hello chat question I am playing league on and off , has taco ever showed his face?
[3:34:23] ender115: yeah wasnt talking to you taco lol
[3:34:31] chucassss: yeah yea justify it whatever way u want
[3:34:33] ender115: dude in chat still mad about double supp
[3:34:35] xch4kr4x: @kostanco don't think so
[3:34:36] Silvah: !facecam
[3:34:36] Nightbot: https://i.gyazo.com/6e8d3f66a85eaeb993dea69c7e775344.png
[3:34:36] ender115: for some reason
[3:34:37] chucassss: ur clearly not here for fun
[3:34:39] malikhulia13: @kostanco his facecam is beside the map :33
[3:34:44] NapNapoleon: Gotta sell that supp item now, right?
[3:34:48] ender115: winning IS fun
[3:34:50] StellarPioneers: dude this Senna gets my fucking rocks off
[3:34:55] ender115: losing is not
[3:34:56] chucassss: thats what u tell urself
[3:34:56] kostanco: ohhh my bad sorry no glasses thnx chat
[3:34:59] StellarPioneers: love to see a support like that
[3:35:02] kostanco: looks like a plushie I have
[3:35:06] chucassss: you would sit in base spam poppy q and perma kill everyone?
[3:35:06] M4kshan: NOWAY TACO??!?!?You are using the same thing everyone else is using to be most effective and win games??In ranked???SMH not my streamer...(C)Clueless Chaters
[3:35:24] S4vagekid: whats that item on your 2?
[3:35:26] ender115: till riot patched it abso fucking lutely
[3:35:28] johnadam131994: Is he the adc or support?
[3:35:33] demonminer3: @makshanua it's litterally just checcass
[3:35:37] Equinimitys: @S4vagekid sup item
[3:35:38] demonminer3: @johnadam131994 yes
[3:35:38] Klony99: @chucassss Are you new? Yes, yes we do.
[3:35:52] Equinimitys: @johnadam131994 he's the adc but he took a sup item also
[3:35:56] S4vagekid: @S4vagekid new meta to build this? dont get it
[3:35:56] malikhulia13: wait so you don't sell the supp item? don't you lose out on gold?
[3:36:01] chucassss: yeah yall dont understnd what fun means then, but i cant change that, yall desentesized to what the game is
[3:36:03] Silvah: @chucassss that was a bug?
[3:36:10] chucassss: @Silvah yep
[3:36:14] Silvah: wow
[3:36:16] demonminer3: @chucassss well, fun is subjective
[3:36:23] chucassss: it is
[3:36:23] tonino412: How do you play double supp item, does "adc" only perma farm and do you sell item
[3:36:26] Equinimitys: @malikhulia13 the gold debuff doesn't apply when the sup item gets leveld up
[3:36:26] Silvah: personally I wouldnt do that bc Idrc for LP
[3:36:29] Klony99: @chucassss Riot doesn't encourage fun. Hasn't done that since Season 4. If you want fun go play Heroes of the Storm or ARAM.
[3:36:43] S4vagekid: Yo taco when do you build this supp item and then sell it? you will lose gold soon
[3:37:03] malikhulia13: @malikhulia13 aaaaahhh I do see the debuff above his HUD and he gets 10g from minions, that';s why I asked
[3:37:04] chucassss: i do play aram cus i dont enjoy the sweat dripping off my enemies balls when i dare to queue a normal
[3:37:07] vsmilotic: why do we have some weird guy being mad about streamer doing whatever he want in his game LUL
[3:37:11] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[3:37:25] Klony99: @chucassss Same. So what's your point for people who enjoy COMPETITIVE play to actually use a COMPETITIVE advantage?
[3:37:26] Silvah: aram gamers
[3:37:27] ender115: @chucassss and there it is
[3:37:27] peshecito: angry back sitter :c
[3:37:30] demonminer3: @chucassss so why are you even here?
[3:37:31] Silvah: are giga tyhard tho
[3:37:34] SomeDudeNamedThaz: what makes double support item good?
[3:37:34] Silvah: tink
[3:37:45] Klony99: You're saying it's unfair that people in a triathlon are using bikes. Like bruv. It's a triathlon, not a walk in the park??
[3:37:48] chucassss: cus im prolly still higher elo that 80% here
[3:37:50] ender115: @SomeDudeNamedThaz pays for itself, gives vision, and gives good item
[3:37:55] chucassss: and i have free speech
[3:37:57] SomeDudeNamedThaz: ah
[3:38:00] Captainflowers22: hahahaha

[3:38:10] Captainflowers22: this has to be bait
[3:38:13] ender115: Im SAYING
[3:38:16] Klony99: @chucassss Free Speech gives you freedom to express yourself, not freedom from being told your expression is ass.
[3:38:21] demonminer3: @Captainflowers22 starting to think that
[3:38:29] peshecito: Totally, must be bored to their bones
[3:38:31] Ukyoji: good R Pog
[3:38:35] Silvah: lillia is so fast
[3:38:35] Klony99: Also this is a privately owned website, there is no free speech here. XD

[3:39:01] nighthunt3rrr: LUL LUL LUL
[3:39:04] Ninawai: xd
[3:39:04] Silvah: free speech is fake
[3:39:12] Klony99: Nobody is free, we're all slaves to the game.
[3:39:14] Klony99: #League of LEgends.
[3:39:14] demonminer3: yeah, free speech is fake
[3:39:18] Silvah: if I dont like you I will snipe you PowerUpL FrogO PowerUpR
[3:39:19] demonminer3: !vanish
[3:39:34] SgtActionAndy: just because you CAN say something doesnt mean you SHOULD say it
[3:39:48] chucassss: just becus u can abuse a bug doesnt mean u should
[3:39:53] Captainflowers22: o damn that sounds fun. i woulda joined u guys but i was fully on board my spaceship by then cap22Space
[3:39:55] Silvah: its so funny to see people fail drive herald
[3:39:59] Klony99: Freedom of Speech != Freedom from Consequences.
[3:40:11] Silvah: @Klony99 tbh thats also true
[3:40:11] vsmilotic: its a bug?
[3:40:16] Silvah: its not a bug
[3:40:20] vsmilotic: isnt it just some unintent interaction
[3:40:23] Klony99: "unintended interaction".
[3:40:25] Silvah: its just an intended interaction
[3:40:29] Klony99: Uninting Operation /s
[3:40:32] ender115: its not even a bug lol
[3:40:35] valo_ren: @Captainflowers22 U excited for 2024 season start? Which rookie are u most excited for?
[3:40:37] vsmilotic: so what i thought was right its not bug
[3:40:45] ender115: yeah its not
[3:40:46] vsmilotic: nothing wrong with it then
[3:40:48] Silvah: bug abusing isnt allowed
[3:40:56] chucassss: there were jsut ppl confirming they would sit in base and spam poppy q to global kill, so yeah thats where we were at
[3:40:57] vsmilotic: this aint same thing like global xerath
[3:40:57] Silvah: abusing unintended interactions is
[3:41:04] diaxowyziom: what do u think about titanic hydra for jhin insta auto reset?
[3:41:04] Captainflowers22: @valo_ren im hella excited. just being back on weekends has me PUMPED. sniper def has the most hype. ppl been talkign about this guy for YEARS and now we get to see if hes real deal or not
[3:41:08] Klony99: That's what I said earlier. If Riot bans you for it it's bad, if not, go ahead bro. Get your LP. All is fair in love and war.
[3:41:11] vsmilotic: what is he saying XD
[3:41:25] Silvah: also can you just drop this topic?
[3:41:26] ender115: utter nonsense
[3:41:28] chucassss: @Klony99 actually there are rules to war
[3:41:40] vsmilotic: tru i will jsut continue to lurk
[3:41:43] demonminer3: @chucassss rules decided by who won the war
[3:41:49] Klony99: @chucassss Now I know you're trolling, you are trying to Uhm Actually a centuries old idiom.
[3:41:55] valo_ren: @Captainflowers22 Sniper deffinitely has all the hype. As an ADC main tho and a 100T fan, I'm excited to see what Meech brings to the table
[3:42:07] SgtActionAndy: 🤓 uhm actually there are rules
[3:42:09] Shackul: mans using guerilla warfare in twitch chat
[3:42:10] Klony99: SOMEONE IS RECEIVING A GOLD PENALTY

[3:42:18] ender115: lcs is back this sat right
[3:42:18] chucassss: @demonminer3 just like meta is decided by who abuses it
[3:42:19] bobalien: @Captainflowers22 definitely excited to see how he'll do tbh. I do think he might need a split or two to get in the right stuff. Or he's a great from the get go.
[3:42:20] ender115: big hype
[3:42:29] bobalien: :b
[3:42:39] Captainflowers22: @ender115 ye, first game of the year for LCS is saturday at noon PST

[3:52:06] teamcap02: is it ever a good idea to not get crit on jhin? i feel like the passive move speed from crits is the only way to care late game
[3:52:11] sojjorjoss: sojjorjoss subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! keep up the good work my man
[3:52:13] gfjelstad: why no mortal?

[3:52:29] T1mbits: @T1mbits i need that
[3:52:30] Silvah: @T1mbits my toplaner actually swapped lanes with me
[3:52:34] T1mbits: my teammates avoid me like the plague
[3:52:38] Silvah: to give me 5 plates top + first tower
[3:52:41] T1mbits: @Silvah not real

[3:54:57] Ellipsoul: monkaW
[3:54:59] Silvah: @T1mbits happens like once every thousand games at most
[3:55:00] ThatOneShotBruh: Corki gaming KEKW
[3:55:05] Silvah: probs 10k even
[3:55:20] T1mbits: :0
[3:55:22] Silvah: @Klony99 AHAAHAAA Idk I think my lux payed them off
[3:55:28] jtswift2010: lol
[3:55:29] Klony99: Iiit's early season, they won't be GMs for long.
[3:55:36] Hsuperman18: horrible
[3:55:43] Equinimitys: the editors are gonna make gold outta this
[3:55:45] akirafudo0655: THİS VİDEO NEEDS CLOWN FİESTA MUSİC
[3:55:45] Ellipsoul: My guy Corki just checked that bush with R even though the enemy team was dead KEKW
[3:55:50] IEvoShockI: this corki has decision making of a low rank kek
[3:55:52] Ellipsoul: There was nobody else
[3:55:54] itLLvi: this season really testing the mental fortitude of adc mains
[3:55:54] monstahkillaz123: IDK man but this season has tilted me much more than the last one
[3:55:57] T1mbits: MALDING
[3:56:03] raying_df: taco toxic ??? omg first time seing the dark side
[3:56:06] zathura6: hi taco
[3:56:11] Klony99: Bought accounts in high elo already? What is this?
[3:56:11] demonminer3: @monstahkillaz123 its litterally less than 3 weeks into the new one
[3:56:21] zathura6: oh no did i cpme in at a bad time my bad my dude
[3:56:26] ThatOneShotBruh: Corki isn't GM
[3:56:29] T1mbits: idk why but this season in particular feels like no one listens to each other
[3:56:29] Silvah: also tim
[3:56:32] bobalien: what's the viego kda right now?
[3:56:37] Silvah: have you played a lot of redside?
[3:56:38] monstahkillaz123: @demonminer3 yeah ik but the items are so unbalanced
[3:56:38] Ellipsoul: Deadge
[3:56:41] armed2thestump: armed2thestump subscribed with Prime. 
[3:56:43] T1mbits: Silvah sadly
[3:56:43] Trollsmirk: RIOT
[3:56:43] zathura6: this looks soul sucking
[3:56:45] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh I think Taco means GM elo.
[3:56:46] Captainflowers22: i think ur point about jg gap might have been true @IKeepItTaco
[3:56:47] T1mbits: i mean do u even play redside
[3:56:48] MISIM: wut the fast
[3:56:48] mitafo: BONK
[3:56:49] Silvah: redside bot feels so fked
[3:56:50] demonminer3: @monstahkillaz123 yeah... feels so shit
[3:56:50] zGamerCrystal: lilia balanced
[3:56:50] hambone_cam: thats a fed deer
[3:56:51] Vladdddddddddddddddd: i can feel it
[3:56:52] T1mbits: u kinda just sit there
[3:56:53] TheLadyTamer: What a freak
[3:56:59] Roostmaster: @bobalien  2-10-10
[3:57:00] Silvah: @T1mbits depends on what you define as playing
[3:57:01] Zandeezee: I think storm surge is okay
[3:57:02] Roostmaster: Lol
[3:57:06] peetzaaaa: that was a good senna i thought
[3:57:08] armed2thestump: @IKeepItTaco could you please tell the sivir and jhin in my last game that them talking about your stream in all was giga cringe - Gragas
[3:57:09] bobalien: honestly not senna the pb, but that viego
[3:57:13] ThatOneShotBruh: what was wrong with the Senna?
[3:57:15] bobalien: thx @Roostmaster
[3:57:15] Zandeezee: hey taco sorry bout this one ikeepitRAREHANDS
[3:57:16] T1mbits: @T1mbits i put another game on while waiting for wave to crash
[3:57:23] zGamerCrystal: you literally said senna was good all game
[3:57:26] bobalien: LOL
[3:57:28] Zandeezee: how’s the rest of the day been?
[3:57:28] whitesnakegg: Why sup item?
[3:57:29] purplov: What's with support item?
[3:57:35] T1mbits: supp item big gold yum yum
[3:57:37] T1mbits: max efficiency
[3:57:42] Klony99: Guys, the support item isn't working as intended.
[3:57:42] Silvah: @T1mbits you usually just wait untill you're going to get fked by a 4man if you're on redside lmao
[3:57:44] bobalien: guess ure right @IKeepItTaco
[3:57:46] Klony99: It's not applying the penalty.

[3:57:49] ThatOneShotBruh: BASED
[3:57:50] T1mbits: @Silvah LITERALLY
[3:57:52] IEvoShockI: Corki didn't play well either, He was doing damage but the moment you guys got a kill he left the team fight KEKW
[3:57:58] peetzaaaa: i see true true
[3:57:59] joakim_____: my 🐫
[3:57:59] EdgePoz: you had so good start ,but senna fuk it all.....
[3:58:05] T1mbits: i love when 4 man bot and my jungler invades his own red
[3:58:09] T1mbits: 5Head
[3:58:10] Silvah: @T1mbits lol
[3:58:11] IEvoShockI: just like at that last dragon and Corki just went to push mid and back instead
[3:58:12] Silvah: "his own red"
[3:58:22] purplov: @klony99 But it did apply debuff
[3:58:23] aoijhin: thing is not everyone is going to do things the way you want to, even if you are right. Sadly, your calls may have been right but senna was thinking otherwise
[3:58:24] raying_df: cmon man its ok now the game is in the past, get over it
[3:58:26] T1mbits: hes counter jungling himself
[3:58:27] Silvah: I had this game where I 2v2 killed botlane on redside
[3:58:36] Silvah: and I got rewarded by getting 4man into 4man into 4man
[3:58:38] Silvah: Pog
[3:58:41] T1mbits: Pog
[3:58:44] T1mbits: HOOLYY amazing reward
[3:58:47] ramisaffour: if anyone here just lost a game with jhin vs sivir tell me i wanna gift u a sub as promised
[3:58:58] thundercracker_108: fr
[3:59:05] Klony99: @T1mbits My friend once told me he hates when you do Baron and the jungler immediately vanishes into their own jungle to clear camps. As a jungle main, that stuck with me so deeply, to this day, I run from Baron to lane, no matter what. And I reason with myself WHY I don't, if I don't.
[3:59:12] zathura6: im sorry man maybe this be last game?
[3:59:13] Klony99: @purplov For one minion. :D
[3:59:27] aoijhin: I think full lethality is a bit too.. idk .. i wouldnt go for it. I feel id be too reliant on my team
[3:59:28] SpartanDumpster: Fuck it I ate the opp
[3:59:35] T1mbits: @T1mbits i do baron and run into enemy nexus
[3:59:45] chucassss: @purplov its "bugged" where if you have 2 it just doesnt work as intended
[3:59:46] Klony99: @raying_df Peace of advice. Telling someone who tells you "I am hurting, this is pain" to "get over it", isn't helping. :D
[3:59:50] raying_df: yknow what this game is the game and if it isnt... just go to sleep
[4:00:04] Klony99: @T1mbits ESSATLY
[4:00:27] zathura6: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh a classic ikeepitJAM ikeepitJAM
[4:00:28] raying_df: Btw taco are you in NA ?
[4:00:30] gloww1337: @raying_df Wtf is that poor attitude lmfao... ?
[4:00:30] ender115: banger alert
[4:00:36] aoijhin: @Klony99 Hes just saying to shake it off and try to move past it, which is fair, hes going to have to do that whether it sucks or not
[4:00:44] Klony99: @chucassss Technically not a bug. AN "unintended interaction". Funny game terms.
[4:01:02] raying_df: @gloww1337 i am trying to support his mental is it really bad ???
[4:01:02] 6_snickerdoodle_9: blaming supports ICANT
[4:01:10] ender115: even if it was a bug its still fine to use lmao
[4:01:16] Roostmaster: @gloww1337 what poor attitude? Stepping away from something is fine.
[4:01:23] Silvah: @T1mbits truee
[4:01:25] Klony99: @aoijhin I understand that, but a) the way he said it was very inappropriate and b) "shake it off" is also not his call. Taco didn't cry about it for ten minutes he said literally once that the game was annoying. :D
[4:01:38] Silvah: @ender115 abusing bugs on purpose can actually get you banned
[4:01:42] chucassss: @Klony99 depends on how u see it, it does something its not supposed to can be called a "bug" / "glitch" depends on the scale and as the scale in this case is vairable it might aswell be a bug

[4:01:54] T1mbits: this season has been messy
[4:01:57] ender115: @Silvah such as?
[4:01:59] Roostmaster: Just a lotta misplay,
[4:01:59] gloww1337: @raying_df Yea I get that but have some understanding for his engagement in game, he's kinda tryharding every game.
[4:02:08] aoijhin: @Klony99 I think you're reading into it too much :P.. the comment was fine.
[4:02:08] Roostmaster: Season cleans up in abt a month
[4:02:17] Silvah: @ender115 if you try to recreate it and people report you for it, you're getting banned
[4:02:28] matsosdm: @roostmaster what do u mean?
[4:02:30] thundercracker_108: How many trolls have you found today?
[4:02:30] chucassss: @Silvah as you should
[4:02:34] IEvoShockI: I understand, I've met various of people trying out supports but like 1/10 games I find a support that actually plays the role. The others are just 'thinking' how support works and just int your lane
[4:02:34] zathura6: im now actually playing the game im currently deciding to main seraphine
[4:02:45] NapNapoleon: Dodge angle?
[4:02:49] Silvah: but not if its an unintended interaction like the double supp item
[4:02:50] gloww1337: @Roostmaster It depends on what it is.
[4:02:51] thundercracker_108: Cuz i had one in 3 games in a row
[4:02:55] Klony99: @chucassss The terms are clearly defined in app development. An unintended interaction is when something happens that you didn't expect, a bug is when something is working incorrectly, despite everything being (seemingly) clearly defined. One interrupts normal operation, the other is just unforseen surprises.
[4:03:02] ender115: just to be clear when i say bug, i mean in game interactions, not stuff like softlocking game
[4:03:02] SpartanDumpster: SpartanDumpster subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Fuck it, I ate the opp! They want to drive a wooden stake into my heartFor pulling my cock out at the Toronto Blue Jays gameAll I'm saying is I paid for the tickets!
[4:03:08] Klony99: @aoijhin No it wasn't. =)
[4:03:18] matsosdm: fck miss fortune man what a skillless champ
[4:03:22] aoijhin: @Klony99 Seems we disagree, thats fine
[4:03:29] Zandeezee: wait taco are you queing support?
[4:03:36] Silvah: @ender115 I was thinking about people buying dark seal on viego so they could oneshot towers
[4:03:45] raying_df: @gloww1337 ok but if you tryhard every game you will get sick maybe he needs a break I mean for himself
[4:03:50] Zandeezee: fair
[4:03:54] yuguero1: is senna stron rn?
[4:03:57] tonino412: And you are adc again xdd
[4:03:58] yuguero1: strong?
[4:04:02] Zandeezee: nah supports have been so ass recently
[4:04:04] gloww1337: @matsosdm Mf isn't a skilless champ at all, morelike a broken af champ xD
[4:04:10] ender115: havent heard of that one, id need to check it out
[4:04:11] Roostmaster: @matsosdm people play new season, get bored, go out of Ranked. Queue 'cleans' up, and for abt 3-5 months, the game quality increases
[4:04:15] Zandeezee: brain power
[4:04:16] Klony99: @raying_df Taco is a professional, he knows when to step away. Recently had a break for a couple weeks to clear his head. This is fine, but it's nice of you to worry!
[4:04:17] T1mbits: KEKW i love the silence after my supports are
[4:04:24] Silvah: @ender115 its an old bug, they already fixed it
[4:04:28] thundercracker_108: its frustrating
[4:04:32] ender115: interdasting
[4:04:36] tonino412: But rn you are just an adc that doesnt farm and has farming supp
[4:04:39] matsosdm: @roostmaster oh ok
[4:04:43] gloww1337: @raying_df So provide him with that meanwhile you show some respect for his engagement. =) Just trying to help.
[4:04:47] Roostmaster: Yee
[4:04:48] raying_df: @Klony99 yeah i really hope he does do that XD
[4:04:55] ender115: im just of the mindset of if its in the game its fair, riot will do what they want with enforcing stuff tho
[4:04:56] Zandeezee: I had a Leo who refused to engage and then flamed me for trading saying “I was inting for taking free poke”
[4:05:02] T1mbits: GOD GIVES HIS TOUGHEST SOLDIERS HIS STRONGEST BATTLES
[4:05:06] Klony99: @raying_df He does! Really. He's just expressing frustration. =)
[4:05:12] Klony99: rofl Tim. XD
[4:05:19] SpartanDumpster: See I don't think God is all knowing, I think God is super curious and likes experimenting with us/
[4:05:24] T1mbits: im gettin real tired of being god's strongest soldier
[4:05:29] ender115: another banger
[4:05:30] Klony99: Jesus wouldn't give you a test you couldn't overcome /s
[4:05:39] zathura6: @IKeepItTaco who is a goods support i can watch to learn?
[4:05:40] Klony99: @T1mbits SAME
[4:05:40] Zandeezee: @t1mbits feel that
[4:05:42] raying_df: wait tahlm kensh ADC ???
[4:05:49] raying_df: tf is this meta
[4:05:50] T1mbits: god be fr overestimating me
[4:05:51] Roostmaster: I've been climbing hard and fast, playing in blocks, win or lose. Have around a 60% wr, and i'm planning on keeping that this season.
[4:05:55] Silvah: @ender115 I only think bug abusing is bad bc that literally breaks the game
[4:06:02] Zandeezee: @zathura6 i0ki ikeepitPUMPKIN
[4:06:11] Klony99: @zathura6 Taco. :D
[4:06:20] Roostmaster: Streaming league while climbing is wack
[4:06:21] ender115: when I think break the game, I think of like literally crashing the game for all 5 level of stuff
[4:06:22] Klony99: He's playing Support rn. :D
[4:06:26] ender115: that kinda stuff i dont mess with
[4:06:36] Silvah: well there were weird bugs
[4:06:38] phoenix_tr03: its fasting senna
[4:06:41] Silvah: where you could sit in base
[4:06:42] gyuki420: how do u deal with akali as jhin
[4:06:46] Silvah: and oneshot everybody on cd
[4:06:48] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[4:06:49] phoenix_tr03: so supp farms senna gets souls
[4:07:13] zathura6: i meant some one that plays support all the time but yes i do know that taco is god support
[4:07:13] Klony99: @aoijhin The intention of the comment was just fine, but the words used were selected poorly. That's the feedback I gave, and I'm comfortable with that feedback.
[4:07:31] Gierczak: what what Senna WIDEPOGGIES WIDEPOGGIES WIDEPOGGIES WIDEPOGGIES @IKeepItTaco Pog
[4:07:39] Roostmaster: Because for like 'actual league' you can 100% to it for like 4-5 matches max, maybe 6. I personally play games in sets of three, and stop there, even if i'm on a winstreak
[4:07:42] Klony99: @zathura6 Just a little joke friend. :D L0ki was mentioned, Netherim is a support main, too.
[4:08:03] Klony99: Variety? Dave the Diver?
[4:08:06] chucassss: @Silvah so whats the line of it being gamebreaking?
[4:08:07] Roostmaster: Scheduling when you play will legit up your wr
[4:08:20] ken_337: ikeepitLUCY
[4:08:20] T1mbits: PogChimp
[4:08:21] matsosdm: @gloww1337 her q has a range of ♾️ her w is free boots her e is slow for the boots her ult is literally annoying and that is when she is not fed if she is fed or gets ahead q does more damage than 4th shots so imo skill less
[4:08:23] Silvah: @chucassss if riot bans you for it
[4:08:24] chucassss: cus with both ur giving urself a competitive advantage
[4:08:36] T1mbits: UNBENCH THE KENCH
[4:08:40] zathura6: @Klony99 oh yeee i know <3  and thank you i do really need to actually learn this game
[4:08:58] Klony99: @zathura6 Eyy good on your for trying to improve. Good luck and never forget to enjoy the journey, bro.
[4:09:09] chucassss: so its up to riot, if riot were to retrospectively say, if you use it now we ban you (thedouble supp stuff) youd stop?, but not bcus u think its bad but bcus riot told u to?
[4:09:14] Zandeezee: ikeepitPUMPKIN
[4:09:19] phoenix_tr03: ur WHAT
[4:09:21] Silvah: oh I dont use it myself
[4:09:23] Gierczak: @IKeepItTaco maybe some tank senna sheningans?
[4:09:25] Zandeezee: what exactly you shoving taco?
[4:09:26] Silvah: but its riots game
[4:09:29] Silvah: they decide the rules
[4:09:40] joakim_____: OSFrog UNLOAD THE TOAD OSFrog
[4:09:48] chucassss: thats a way of seeing it
[4:10:16] lbku: thoughts on the double support item strategy?
[4:10:17] Brother_Herring: !duo
[4:10:17] Nightbot: Nobody currently
[4:10:22] 붼이토: BASED
[4:10:22] Silvah: oh its katevolved
[4:10:23] phoenix_tr03: he might not like tank senna guys
[4:10:28] Xistentialist24: I would argue also for games where you first-pick Senna and ur team goes dumb champs and all damage and you know you'll have zero peel and your team needs some survivability lol
[4:10:32] Klony99: @chucassss Do you play tanks with AP items in ARAM?
[4:10:40] chucassss: @lbku you have to use it cus everyone does, otherwise u lose the game for free
[4:10:42] Zandeezee: ah the double support item tech
[4:10:44] Xistentialist24: Tank Senna is my response to my teammates being dumb XD
[4:10:45] Roostmaster: Tank Senna is crong
[4:10:45] Gierczak: @phoenix_tr03 he might KEKW
[4:10:45] KryDBayBay: Im a player who doesnt have hands & understanding of the game, its the perfect champ for me taco???
[4:10:47] zathura6: i loved that analogy lool
[4:10:49] chucassss: @Klony99 i do it all baby
[4:11:10] Silvah: @Xistentialist24 first pick senna players quantWeirdpaper
[4:11:16] Klony99: @chucassss BUt that is bad for the meta. It makes it harder to balance AP items and tanks for Summoners Rift. Why do you abuse the game?
[4:11:17] Eposs42: @IKeepItTaco why are u executing cannons? dont u get less souls cause it counts as kill?
[4:11:21] gloww1337: @matsosdm You base your perspective because you dislike her, she's really not "skilless", if you know how to play it you can even turn around a game from behind.
[4:11:24] Xistentialist24: I mean you HAVE to go Titanic second so you have an AD item and some dmg
[4:11:34] Klony99: @Eposs42 Think they are shared with the support item, aren't they?
[4:11:35] Gierczak: if you dont have fun from game what is the point of playing it
[4:11:40] chucassss: @Klony99 i mean ur arguments were good until this one
[4:11:46] Klony99: @KryDBayBay Garen.
[4:11:50] Xistentialist24: @Xistentialist24 Look sometimes my team shows certain picks and then doesnt' stick to them as draft goes on lol
[4:11:54] Eposs42: @Klony99 u still get less souls
[4:11:55] phoenix_tr03: 4 people bot just to stare at them LMAO
[4:12:12] gloww1337: @Gierczak Alot of people play this game because of other reason, it's really unfortunately.
[4:12:13] Roostmaster: Not even close
[4:12:14] Silvah: wait whose tp got cancelled?
[4:12:19] phoenix_tr03: holy fuck that tower shot
[4:12:24] Natecchi: wait, that's KatEvolved CaitlynS
[4:12:29] NapNapoleon: Lots of hp left
[4:12:33] zaikage_pookie: op.gg
[4:12:36] ChaosSmurf: bro.
[4:12:43] T1mbits: bro.
[4:12:44] gloww1337: @Natecchi Nope it's Chovy! =)
[4:12:44] zaikage_pookie: opgg
[4:12:45] Aki_sd: nah
[4:12:50] Pattox: bro.
[4:12:59] Klony99: @chucassss No Riot came out and said it's literally bad for the meta to play AP tanks. Tanks are made to survive and provide CC, and by playing them on damage you turn ARAM into a less fun version of Duck Hunt, with Ducks shooting back at you. But you don't consider this an immoral action because it's not noted in the patch notes as unintended interaction. Is that all the reason you need? RIot telling you it's unintended?
[4:13:00] Natecchi: ikeepitSMILERS sure
[4:13:03] Xistentialist24: You did miss but I am pretty sure he still dies to the Brand E  explosion
[4:13:07] Gierczak: @gloww1337 its like I understand but on other hand its just bunch of pixels why bother right?
[4:13:11] Klony99: @Eposs42 gold > souls
[4:13:20] lbku: thoughts on voltaic cyclosword on jhin?
[4:13:49] Xistentialist24: @Eposs42 Uhhhh that's super context dependant lol. Souls on Senna are pretty key. Soul actually worth more than ranged creep 100% of time.
[4:13:58] Silvah: @Klony99 HUH
[4:14:01] gloww1337: @Gierczak I'm amazed by these people that actually got account who're lvl 1000+, that's just insane lmfao.
[4:14:26] Gierczak: @gloww1337 bruh player like that rly need some mental support
[4:14:39] Gierczak: number of games is insane
[4:14:41] Gierczak: xdd
[4:14:46] Klony99: @Silvah Been ages ago Silvah. But it's making it harder to balance if you play Assassin Malphite with Ludens. Which is why they simply nerfed tankiness to make up for it.
[4:14:58] chucassss: @Klony99 im giving myself a competitive disadvantage to play something different, and since most players only care about winning they should win more so thereby i am doing them a favour
[4:15:07] Silvah: @Klony99 why not remove his AP ratios then?
[4:15:08] arrysolomons: that was really fucking good
[4:15:13] gloww1337: @Gierczak Yea I don't think it's average, that's for sure.
[4:15:32] odetwojoy: tahm continues to  be the goat
[4:15:46] blaz1n_ace: are you duo with katevolved rn? or was it just luck
[4:15:47] Klony99: @Silvah Wouldn't work for Summoners Rift. And the only balance they apply to ARAM is by adding or subtracting flat values. The "Balance" buff you see over your champ bar.
[4:16:00] Hsuperman18: I feel u
[4:16:02] Arbaddon: Arbaddon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 51 months! Always enjoying your streams if I get to watch them. Keep it up ikeepitCOMFY
[4:16:03] matsosdm: @gloww1337 regardless of what champ u main u can always turn around games if u know how to play and I also dislike senna tahm velkoz  and so on but I dont think they are skill less. But in Mf  they are abilities that necessarily require skill hitting them thats why she is skill less imo
[4:16:03] Silvah: @Klony99 wdym? if malphite got no AP ratios
[4:16:09] Silvah: he wont build AP
[4:16:11] Klony99: @chucassss When are you giving yourself a competitive disadvantage? If you play AP Tanks?
[4:16:17] KryDBayBay: I fuck and suck ass, should i main support
[4:16:29] polips: feel like adc might be the most useless role rn
[4:16:37] arrysolomons: nah, every adc blame their supp not just you
[4:16:41] Silvah: or you can like lower his AP ratios and increase the base dmg
[4:16:43] NS_Hypop: 2 support meta again?
[4:16:45] ThatOneShotBruh: it depends, bad supports influence the game much more than a bad ADC, but a good ADC influences the game more than a good support
[4:16:45] chucassss: @Klony99 if i play lethality zoe, ap ornn, lethality darius
[4:16:50] matsosdm: @gloww1337 there are not
[4:17:10] Raven_catJAM: @Silvah oh hell no pls no more malph base dmg, hes already got plenty
[4:17:28] phoenix_tr03: IRELIAING
[4:17:29] Klony99: @Silvah But SR AP Malphite isn't op. It's a viable option to build one or two AP items to be more of a bruiser. Removing his AP ratios would remove his ability to be useful in SR. Full AP is not viable in SR because his ult cooldown rarely hits 5 people. But in ARAM it's teamfight City, so you get a lot of value out of full AP. It remains a problem though.
[4:17:54] Silvah: @Klony99 I dont think building AP on SR malphite is useful either
[4:18:05] Juxt3n: what does that sup item do
[4:18:15] Klony99: @chucassss That wasn't my question though. AP Malphite is not meta defying but harmful to the game and a "problem" as denoted by Riot. How is that different from using 2 support items? Please explain.
[4:18:49] Klony99: @Silvah It isn't. You can build Demonic Embrace to be more of a bruiser. It helps if you need to splitpush or go 1 - 3 - 1.
[4:18:51] chucassss: @Klony99 harmfull to both sr and aram or just aram?
[4:19:11] Silvah: @Klony99 demonic embrace doesnt exist anymore
[4:19:13] Klony99: @chucassss How does that matter? You can't build support items on SR, can you?
[4:19:15] mEczem: ikeepitLETTER ikeepitLETTER ikeepitLETTER
[4:19:36] LanceyPhD: why 2 sp items??
[4:19:43] Klony99: @Silvah What is your point?
[4:20:04] Silvah: @Klony99 that there are ways to stomp champs from building too much AP
[4:20:08] Silvah: stop*
[4:20:26] Silvah: and they've done nothing like that
[4:20:32] ThatOneShotBruh: what even is this argument about, lmao
[4:20:44] chucassss: @Klony99 it matters in my argument, as if its only a problem in aram, thats on riots lazyness for limiting the balancing in aram to just %based dmg nerfs + as a player ur playing a distilled version of the main game, which is only teamfights, so obviously the balance is gonna be shit, thats cus its not their main product
[4:20:48] ChaosSmurf: people who spend all day watching the game and not playing it ;DD
[4:20:50] Klony99: @Silvah And they apply those ways in Summoner's Rift. But ARAM is a different environment with limited balancing, meaning it's not possible for Riot with their current tools to balance ARAM properly, it is dependant on the SR meta.
[4:21:01] animemastert1: !opgg
[4:21:01] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[4:21:26] Klony99: @chucassss You can't balance ARAM differently because the League client only has 1 instance of the game files. They can't add more game modes because they don't have anyone at the company who knows how the code for the launcher works.
[4:21:31] ThatOneShotBruh: @Silvah it literally is possible for them to balance it properly, they just dont give enough of a shit
[4:21:42] xDicTaterx: what in tarnation
[4:21:46] Klony99: No it's not. =/
[4:21:51] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[4:22:02] Klony99: They removed Dominion because they couldn't balance multiple modes.
[4:22:06] Klony99: And they removed 3v3.
[4:22:11] mEczem: akali ResidentSleeper
[4:22:14] ThatOneShotBruh: we literally had Arena-specific balance changes...
[4:22:26] phoenix_tr03: did one akali q just do half ur hp
[4:22:28] phoenix_tr03: lmao
[4:22:32] matsosdm: what was dominion again?
[4:22:34] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh They use different items for that. Did they change the hero damage directly? How champions work?
[4:22:40] ThatOneShotBruh: @matsosdm capture the flag
[4:22:43] Klony99: @matsosdm capture the flag mode.
[4:22:57] chowleyf: !mic
[4:22:57] ThatOneShotBruh: @ThatOneShotBruh they changed champions themselves for arena
[4:23:12] ThatOneShotBruh: look up the patch on which arena was added last split
[4:23:12] matsosdm: @klony99 oh yea fck me im old
[4:23:14] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh Cool, then Arena has new code that wasn't available before and my information is outdated.
[4:23:19] ChaosSmurf: I don't think I would argue with someone who earnestly believes Riot don't know how the launcher works
[4:23:29] T1mbits: akali monkaGIGA
[4:23:34] Silvah: didnt they remove 3v3 bc nobody played it?
[4:23:39] T1mbits: ye
[4:23:39] arrysolomons: hey guys, how is Aphelios in the new meta? Work has kept me busy and I cant play league that much.
[4:23:41] Klony99: @ChaosSmurf I don't believe that. Riot August said that.
[4:23:49] Klony99: I know for a fact that this is the case.
[4:23:52] ThatOneShotBruh: @ChaosSmurf clip or it didnt happen
[4:24:05] Klony99: Nobody who works at Riot Games at the moment was involved in the documentation of Summoner's Code, which is the language the launcher was written in.
[4:24:07] meruem1997: hey Taco how is ot goin'
[4:24:19] ChaosSmurf: please, please show me the tweet
[4:24:34] Klony99: And reverse engineering it isn't feasible. Same problem Blizzard had before WoW Classic.
[4:24:48] ChaosSmurf: that isn't... remotely the problem Blizzard had with WoW Classic
[4:24:50] ChaosSmurf: they just didn't have the files
[4:25:10] ThatOneShotBruh: and they werent even interested in releasing Classic for a long time
[4:25:13] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh I don't know if that stream is archived, it was last year around Summer when Taco hosted August. I am not going to provide evidence for my claims in twitch chat, you're not my professor.
[4:25:27] matsosdm: what dos stacks give u on senna?
[4:25:35] ThatOneShotBruh: @Klony99 then don't complain when people call bs
[4:25:35] ChaosSmurf: okay budddddddy
[4:25:44] ChaosSmurf: make up more believable stuff, ye
[4:25:52] Silvah: @Klony99 1 thing I do know is that riots early code is fked
[4:26:03] YAAN_ttv: kaisa new build , does anyone have an idea ?
[4:26:03] Silvah: which is why some bugs are unfixable
[4:26:06] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh They had to disable Eyes of the Beast because they didn't understand how the code works in Cataclysm. Idk what to tell you, I've been gathering information about this topic for years, I know it's accurate, if you don't believe me, please leave me alone.
[4:26:27] ThatOneShotBruh: @ThatOneShotBruh you are the one passionate about this Shruge
[4:26:29] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh I provided logical proof, if you want evidence of dev interviews you'll have to find them yourself.
[4:26:32] Silvah: like a few of nunu's bugs are never gonna get fixed bc it will kill the client
[4:26:35] matsosdm: what do those souls give u on senna again?
[4:26:36] ThatOneShotBruh: @ThatOneShotBruh "proof"
[4:26:53] Klony99: Why are you being an asshole about this, Bruh?
[4:27:04] vxmps_: this guy's "proof" is legit just i made it up
[4:27:15] Klony99: If you're not passionate about this just accept my point for the sake of arguement?
[4:27:16] ThatOneShotBruh: @Klony99 where am I being an asshole, you are pulling shit out of your ass and then being smug about it
[4:27:35] Pattox: is bleach worth watching?
[4:27:38] ThatOneShotBruh: Idk tbh
[4:27:40] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh I'm not being smug I explained where I know it from and what was said. It's an indirect quote, you can look it up. =/
[4:27:51] Klony99: Me. They're argueing about facts about League that I have to prove apparently.
[4:27:53] boxboxscat: I think both parties are equally responsible here
[4:28:08] Silvah: IRELIAING
[4:28:08] arrysolomons: we are talking, about what are the best tacos.
[4:28:26] akirafudo0655: senna is op in this season?
[4:28:37] DairyChronicle: last time i had katevolved on my team he said I needed to be killed
[4:28:46] aoijhin: @DairyChronicle DAN
[4:28:47] aoijhin: DAMN
[4:28:49] matsosdm: u not talking to us is a wake up call as a man who loves 4 said
[4:28:54] ThatOneShotBruh: @DairyChronicle what else do you expect? dude is giga toxic
[4:28:58] coolio_beanio: @DairyChronicle was he right?
[4:29:13] chucassss: @Klony99 i cant find the article rn, but i think if i cant build offmeta, then they designed the game wrong or gave items too much power, like why give a champion sclaings if he aint supposed to use them, thats a bad design in itself
[4:29:17] arrysolomons: what were you expecting from a kata otp?
[4:29:20] DairyChronicle: @DairyChronicle i was roleplaying in team chat you will have to decide
[4:29:30] mr1bru: what is your range naw
[4:29:32] PizzaPres: senna is permabanned by me
[4:29:33] aoijhin: @arrysolomons sanest kata main
[4:29:34] DesolateLotus: honestly compared to a lot of streamers kata is not that toxic
[4:29:50] Klony99: @chucassss So if they create an item that gives too much gold... they designed the game wrong... and gave the item too much power... That's okay to use then?
[4:30:02] mEczem: @PizzaPres i still ban fizz
[4:30:03] Silvah: @chucassss didnt riot even promote hybrid builds?
[4:30:14] chucassss: @Silvah to my knowledge yes
[4:30:15] Silvah: I remember this video with an onhit soraka
[4:30:18] Klony99: @Silvah This is about the Support item "bug", Silvah.
[4:30:18] matsosdm: but u said u dont like meta abusers
[4:30:28] chucassss: @Klony99 this isnt intended in the design of the item though, i guess
[4:30:34] Silvah: @Klony99 isnt it about items in general now tho?
[4:30:40] Silvah: bc AP tanks dont build supp items
[4:30:43] arrysolomons: might be a over hated opinion, but I think this season is much better than the last.
[4:30:44] Klony99: @Silvah If AP Malphite causes balancing issues, and AP Malphite is fine, then 2 Support Items is also fine, because it creates the same balancing issues Riot is at fault for.
[4:31:07] Silvah: @Klony99 oh I think both are riots fault
[4:31:10] Klony99: @chucassss Then they fix it in a patch or two and are done with it. You weren't intended to oneshot ADCs with Luden's Echo as Malphite, either.
[4:31:20] T1mbits: LOOL
[4:31:22] usraka54: is trinity good as a last item on senna?
[4:31:22] Eragon010: !song
[4:31:22] Nightbot: You can see the song on stream at the bottom left corner or the top center of the screen.
[4:31:26] T1mbits: negative hp lost
[4:31:29] mr1bru: I have this cham soo much
[4:31:31] Hsuperman18: sup gap
[4:31:36] mr1bru: gg
[4:31:36] Klony99: @Silvah Yup, I was just proving that to @chucassss
[4:31:38] raying_df: ggwp
[4:31:41] Silvah: @Klony99 and if they dont want people to do it they can punish them for it
[4:31:41] spensor_pt: GG
[4:31:56] Klony99: @Silvah Again, just proving that logically.
[4:32:04] hands0me_matt: i swear ppl having a mental brakedown in all chat is one of the funniest thing
[4:32:13] T1mbits: NOTED
[4:32:19] ThatOneShotBruh: Taco, do what Rekkles did. Play support main and adc off role, so that you don't get autofilled supps
[4:32:29] matsosdm: why dont they make jhin 2 hit the wards so annoying when I have to 4th shot a pink ward
[4:32:39] ThatOneShotBruh: nvm, didnt see you were already doing that
[4:32:58] salkinor: off topic but as an adc player im interested, whats ur thought on zeri rn?
[4:33:08] chucassss: @Klony99 in my eyes there is a small difference in the design of one being just not balanced/balanceable and the other one being a mistake in coding, but i see ur point and i get that yall wanna win as much as possible, i just think its better for the game if we didnt "need to" abuse this stuff
[4:33:10] ThatOneShotBruh: KEKW
[4:33:35] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh Hey man, sorry for calling you an ass. The issues Riot and Blizzard had with their legacy code are well documented. I think they had multiple dev talks where they talked about it, so if you want to go look it up, "troubles with new game modes" or "legacy code League Launcher" would be good points to start. I'm not gonna go through the effort to look that up for you though. Hope you're having a good night regardless.
[4:33:39] chucassss: but different folks different strokes
[4:33:40] Silvah: @Klony99 oh I agree with you on this, if riot makes a mistake then its on them and not on the players
[4:33:47] mm_scofield: jhin support
[4:33:55] mm_scofield: is not that bad :D
[4:34:08] chucassss: imma hit the hay, good evening fellas, was a fun talk non the less
[4:34:16] Silvah: nn
[4:34:31] m1ronakos_mi: taco whats the new built for jhin  ???
[4:34:33] ThatOneShotBruh: how tf does that even happen? was that after the sexual harassment accusations or something?
[4:34:36] T1mbits: :0
[4:34:44] salkinor: @Klony99 u meaning the supp item "bug"?
[4:34:44] ThatOneShotBruh: @Klony99 no worries
[4:34:47] d2m2s: so no documentation in this indie company
[4:34:52] Klony99: @chucassss I agree with that last point completely. I want Riot to create 40-100 equal items that create different paths of equally viable ways to play champs. But Riot said in a dev talk that they prefer to keep the game focused around a meta.
[4:34:55] Klony99: SEE?
[4:34:55] ThatOneShotBruh: yeah, the art feels really different from before
[4:35:02] Klony99: That's exactly what I said, thanks for confirming @IKeepItTaco
[4:35:13] Klony99: @salkinor Yes.
[4:35:16] T1mbits: ChipiChapa
[4:35:21] Klony99: Shit this chat chain got too long for my screen.
[4:35:34] Silvah: @Klony99 I watched an august stream and he said htat riot purposefully buffed certain items
[4:35:37] ThatOneShotBruh: but then again, you were wrong about Riot not being able to change champions for specific game modes, look up patch 13.24 as an example
[4:35:37] Silvah: to force metas
[4:35:43] T1mbits: tenmo
[4:35:55] Klony99: NOPE. Summoner's Code is NOT properly documented.
[4:36:12] Klony99: That's the issue, it's a mostly undocumented libary. Remember that OG Riot was an indie company.
[4:36:13] AquinoLol: oh no which one is it. Garbocan or Jamaican banana
[4:36:13] T1mbits: do be lookin like kaisa support game
[4:36:16] chucassss: @Klony99 yeah its also just nearly impossible to balance, so i get the need for riot to keep it simpler, in an ideal world this game would be so amazing
[4:36:16] T1mbits: Thinkge
[4:36:29] T1mbits: Sadge
[4:36:31] Eposs42: @Klony99 so you work with riot and can look into the code?
[4:36:50] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Jhupport
[4:36:51] Silvah: @Klony99 I heard that from augusts stream
[4:36:51] zathura6: loooooooooool
[4:36:54] T1mbits: non believers
[4:36:55] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Janna
[4:36:57] Klony99: @chucassss Sorry I had to interrupt myself to thank Taco. See, Riot said they want a focused meta to balance around. Which means things like AP Jax or AP Yi, the "fun" builds, get slowly removed and nerfed, because they are "breaking" the way Riot intends the game to be played. This is to make it more viable for Esports, it's not more fun for all players.
[4:37:02] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[4:37:03] salkinor: @Klony99 i watched prime league(national esports) today and they allowed this. imo this bug abusing. kinda sad that this works rn but the fix is kinda easy
[4:37:06] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Janna Doesn't do anyhingg
[4:37:07] Klony99: @Silvah Same.
[4:37:09] ramisaffour: As someone who's speaks English as a second language I don't understand a shit about this argument
[4:37:14] Zandeezee: auto attackers into sivir
[4:37:16] Zandeezee: smart
[4:37:16] hina_nomory: janna isn't good at disengaging?
[4:37:22] Mpolo98: no cc
[4:37:23] Silvah: @Klony99 pyke mid
[4:37:31] Avid_Futa_Enjoyer: @ramisaffour who's = who is
[4:37:34] Klony99: @salkinor It's not bug abusing because it's an easy to spot mistake from Riot. Riot fucked up, so they are not punishing players for it.
[4:37:38] Zandeezee: sivir just perma dies
[4:37:40] Zandeezee: lol
[4:37:45] T1mbits: nowono
[4:37:46] DairyChronicle: he gaslit them into dodging
[4:37:51] DairyChronicle: when tis actually a losing lane for him
[4:37:59] chucassss: @Klony99 yeah makes sense, imma dip now, good talk, have a good evening sir
[4:38:16] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh Did you miss where I agreed with you on that? I don't know how they are doing this, but I am pretty sure it's because Arena is a new game mode that they specifically made to balance it properly.
[4:38:20] T1mbits: the easiest way to win every botlane is to paypall enemy jungle
[4:38:38] salkinor: @salkinor @Klony99 yea but its not working as intended. as i said, my opinion on this
[4:38:40] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Taco is thinking like chess player
[4:38:48] zathura6: they saved themsleves
[4:38:48] Klony99: @chucassss In an ideal world, every game mode - those made for fun, and those made for competitive play - were balanced separately!
[4:39:05] Klony99: @Eposs42 No, I have listened intensively to people who do though.
[4:39:27] ThatOneShotBruh: @IKeepItTaco, when do you think a mix of lethality and crit is better than pure lethality? My guess is when you want to be more consistent.
[4:39:28] T1mbits: okie i go Bedge goodnight chat goodnight taco, hope you have better luck with your games
[4:39:35] Silvah: @T1mbits nn babe
[4:39:50] Klony99: @salkinor Just explaining why it's not punished. You can think whatever you like, I don't think there is an objectively wrong POV.
[4:39:54] lovesthedough91: good ones think about it
[4:39:56] T1mbits: catKISS
[4:39:58] Klony99: Nighty Tim. Sleep tight brother.
[4:40:15] Silvah: @T1mbits catKISS
[4:40:47] lethalbonsai: bro i did 2 quick games
[4:40:52] lethalbonsai: both games i was sloppy af
[4:40:58] lethalbonsai: i think i shouldnt play rank today
[4:41:00] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh I would love it so much if you could mix both. But if you commit to one, you need to go full throttle. Lethality drops off with armor, and contains armor pen, so the more you have, the more damage you do against armored targets. Meanwhile if you don't have 100% crit, your damage is luck based, which isn't viable for competitive play.
[4:41:21] BufnerCash: @IKeepItTaco hey taco in witch elo do you think these foundamentals that you explained are getting done?
[4:41:26] AquinoLol: would the storm razor/rfc build be good on senna?
[4:41:30] Klony99: @chucassss Good night and have a great evening buddy.
[4:41:33] zathura6: just a little scare
[4:41:34] Klony99: Thanks for the civil chat.
[4:41:42] chucassss: 07
[4:41:57] SaltedIIIBlueberries: I remember there is OTP jungle aphelios named PhD Jungelios who climbed to master
[4:42:03] lethalbonsai: 12.5k rareboi chips
[4:42:10] ThatOneShotBruh: @ThatOneShotBruh Yoummu's > Collector > IE > LDR > RFC gives you 100% crit, no?
[4:42:14] lethalbonsai: half way to buy discord role
[4:42:16] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Btw it's not a good pick
[4:42:16] Klony99: @BufnerCash Every elo. If you play correctly you'll climb. If your question is which elo EVERY PLAYER knows these... Masters+? But you can find people not adhereing to basic truths all the way to Challenger.
[4:42:51] ramisaffour: Fucky?
[4:42:58] ThatOneShotBruh: fucky wucky
[4:43:11] ThatOneShotBruh: oh god, Seraphine bot DIESOFCRINGE
[4:43:15] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh I would have to look it up, but that build lacks a survival item, and does not have enough crit to warrant leaving out more armor pen, I believe.
[4:43:28] final_zangetsu: @IKeepItTaco what resolution do you play on?
[4:43:37] BufnerCash: DAM only chal and gm and even there some foget about those T_T
[4:43:41] zoegami_: helloooo ^^
[4:43:42] Klony99: Does IE have 40% Crit? Yourmus doesn't have Crit iirc, so you'd end up with 80%.
[4:43:54] lethalbonsai: @BufnerCash what fundamental he says i missed it
[4:43:58] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Taco you not longer uses u.gg overlay?
[4:44:00] ThatOneShotBruh: @Klony99 collector has crit
[4:44:01] Klony99: @BufnerCash Game is hard, people make mistakes. Can't be avoided.
[4:44:28] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh Collector 20, LDR 20, RFC 20, Yourmus 0, IE has how much?
[4:44:29] ThatOneShotBruh: ah nvm, I thought IE had 40% crit
[4:44:30] drtheo97: @Klony99 I belive in that too
[4:44:42] bigbrother0012: Are u climbing with senna?
[4:44:42] lethalbonsai: @ThatOneShotBruh not anymore
[4:44:43] lovesthedough91: lee sin is early game though
[4:44:47] verschickkt: enemy scale good too with syndra and bel
[4:44:50] verschickkt: and jax
[4:44:51] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh Yup that's why I asked. Leaves you at 80%. That's enough for Graves but not for Jhin I'm afraid.
[4:45:37] ThatOneShotBruh: ngl, I low-key want Riot to slightly nerf Jhin. He has a 20% pick rate atm SadgeCry
[4:45:40] zathura6: does that mean he is a meta climber?
[4:45:44] Klony99: Phew. Now my brain is burning from all the neurons I activated the last hour.
[4:46:03] lethalbonsai: @ThatOneShotBruh cuz they saw some random tik tok page saying its meta
[4:46:09] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh They didn't buff Jhin, so I assume they'll just nerf Lethality in 10-20 days and be done with it.
[4:46:10] final_zangetsu: the guy who asked what resoltion you play on is still here, what is it>
[4:46:14] lethalbonsai: and everyone playing him even tho noone knows how to play it
[4:46:26] final_zangetsu: ty
[4:46:35] Therealmusty: Hey taco how's your day going
[4:46:44] ThatOneShotBruh: @ThatOneShotBruh I mean, most stats websites are putting him into S tier
[4:46:54] bigbrother0012: Tank senna is always good u have hp and damage
[4:46:58] ender115: im ngl ive tried jhin a lot lately but its just so weird for me to play compared to my usual champ pool
[4:47:01] Klony99: Yeah because he's a ranged assassin. He thrives on Lethality builds.
[4:47:20] Klony99: Killing people across the map is also just a lot of fun.
[4:47:26] SwagChef: !build
[4:47:26] Nightbot: https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/14-1-ikeepittacos-grandmaster-jhin-guide-season-14-569038
[4:47:27] ThatOneShotBruh: @ThatOneShotBruh I don't remember Phreak mentioning they were nerfing lethality across the board next patch, but I could be wrong, I didn't see the whole thing
[4:47:50] bigbrother0012: Are u supp
[4:47:52] akirafudo0655: jhin skin tierlist ı need
[4:47:55] bigbrother0012: Or adc
[4:48:01] lethalbonsai: @ThatOneShotBruh i dont think they gona nerf it soon
[4:48:06] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: How do you collect souls vs these champs
[4:48:09] lethalbonsai: that was the point of new season
[4:48:17] Klony99: @ThatOneShotBruh I haven't seen it, this is unfounded information. It's just how Riot usually acts. Let players climb with OP damage for a patch or two and then see if you need to adjust it. And I think the new Lethality items - which make Lethality stronger than Crit across the board - will be reigned in in the next couple patches.
[4:48:52] akirafudo0655: ı dont know what should ıwrite
[4:48:57] Silvah: @Klony99 do that after I hit diamond
[4:49:04] akirafudo0655: ı need jhin skin tierlist
[4:49:07] Klony99: My opinion is founded on the fact that Taco, the king of Jhin, plays Lethality over Crit. I have no idea if the items are actually so much better, or just new.
[4:49:11] Silvah: !tierlist
[4:49:12] Klony99: @Silvah :D
[4:49:13] Silvah: !skins
[4:49:13] Nightbot: Jhin skin tier list: High Noon > Dark Cosmic > Soul Fighter > Empyrean > Shan Hai Scrolls > Classic > DWG > Project > Bloodmoon > SKT
[4:49:20] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Is this viziepop song?
[4:49:21] ender115: its funny because i saw a few pre season vids about how the on hit items were all gonna be hotfixed because of how good they would be
[4:49:24] ender115: now its all lethality
[4:49:43] Silvah: @ender115 onhit is good in pro
[4:49:45] mcegginton: Lee thought he was him
[4:49:48] Silvah: lethality better in soloQ
[4:49:51] ender115: oh fs
[4:49:57] lethalbonsai: @mcegginton xd
[4:50:04] derreneya: .............
[4:50:04] ender115: i prefer onhit in general
[4:50:08] Silvah: in pro play they actually peel the onhit champs
[4:50:08] Silvah: lol
[4:50:19] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @ender115 I also saw a comment saying pros are building double ap on pro. Interesting that we all have different experiences
[4:50:27] ender115: esp terminus
[4:50:36] ender115: such a cool item
[4:50:37] Silvah: in soloQ they blitz hook akali into you
[4:50:38] lethalbonsai: is it true riot gona change mmr system ?
[4:50:40] Silvah: before you get to auto
[4:50:47] Silvah: @lethalbonsai already did
[4:51:01] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Jhin and MF and Senna aren't exactly king of self peel
[4:51:01] ender115: @WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo interdasting
[4:51:09] lethalbonsai: @Silvah oh so thats the reason why rank reset was that big
[4:51:11] Ylaziel: Best track from FFXV
[4:51:14] tukano2: is this final fantasy theme song?
[4:51:15] lethalbonsai: to reset everything
[4:51:30] ThatOneShotBruh: @Silvah rank reset is normal tho?
[4:51:47] lethalbonsai: @ThatOneShotBruh i think they did a bigger reset this patch
[4:51:49] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[4:52:00] lethalbonsai: like me and whole ym friends demoted 2 whole ranks
[4:52:07] Silvah: I had the opposite
[4:52:08] lethalbonsai: like
[4:52:11] ThatOneShotBruh: there is no "bigger and smaller rank resets", at least AFAIK
[4:52:11] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Why is everyone linking deeplol
[4:52:14] lethalbonsai: from e2 first prome and i was g1
[4:52:17] ender115: i was palced roughly around the same
[4:52:19] ThatOneShotBruh: I think it just depends on your placements and stuff
[4:52:28] Silvah: 1 of my friends
[4:52:33] ThatOneShotBruh: but it could be just Riot Rioting
[4:52:38] Silvah: was a higher rank after placements than their peak rank
[4:52:46] lethalbonsai: @Silvah XD
[4:52:48] lethalbonsai: lucky
[4:52:49] ThatOneShotBruh: the Senna incident RIOT
[4:52:54] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Seraphine Senna's a good combo according to lolalytics so this comp gonna carry late game trust
[4:52:56] Silvah: insane mmr tho I guess
[4:52:57] ender115: well damn
[4:52:59] Diamonita: ive demoted as far down as possible. i give up
[4:52:59] ThatOneShotBruh: FATHER DRUTA
[4:53:00] chowleyf: lmao
[4:53:01] zathura6: ????
[4:53:02] ender115: adc tilted
[4:53:13] Silvah: @lethalbonsai Idk they just have insane mmr or smth
[4:53:14] dblbarrelsup: lmao na getting called a pig by an uwu champ player
[4:53:38] lethalbonsai: @Silvah or that
[4:53:46] lethalbonsai: but yeah now that i think
[4:53:57] lethalbonsai: after i performed good after promos
[4:54:01] Silvah: I mean before they never did that
[4:54:01] lethalbonsai: im getting consistent teammates
[4:54:02] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: free soul in the jungle :(
[4:54:05] Silvah: thats smth new I think
[4:54:05] lethalbonsai: no more tilted trollers
[4:54:38] lethalbonsai: last season i was stuck at e2 because of trollers
[4:54:41] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Wait are you double support item?
[4:54:42] happymangs: can someone explain the senna adc meta to me? i have gone up against it 5 times and it felt bad
[4:54:42] lethalbonsai: could have reached diamond
[4:55:01] Silvah: emerald last season
[4:55:09] Silvah: was a mess
[4:55:15] lethalbonsai: @Silvah fr
[4:55:26] lethalbonsai: when season was coming to an end
[4:55:33] lethalbonsai: i used to get 1 time good team
[4:55:38] lethalbonsai: and 9 times tilted kids
[4:55:47] Silvah: I wanted to try going for dia
[4:55:50] lethalbonsai: i fell from e2 to p1 in a week
[4:55:52] Silvah: but it was too fked
[4:55:53] lethalbonsai: and went e4
[4:55:56] Diamonita: i dont get why im not improving, dont know what more to do to get better
[4:56:00] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Senna has so much more souls nowadays huh
[4:56:09] lethalbonsai: @Diamonita what rank are you ?
[4:56:20] Silvah: @lethalbonsai Despairge
[4:56:26] Diamonita: @lethalbonsai iron… 4 🫠
[4:56:35] lethalbonsai: @Diamonita tff
[4:56:39] SaltedIIIBlueberries: You need to aim a in the path of they walking, most of the time they for some reason won't dodge th w
[4:56:47] lethalbonsai: what region @Diamonita
[4:56:59] Diamonita: @lethalbonsai euw
[4:57:06] lethalbonsai: @Diamonita agh
[4:57:08] lethalbonsai: im eune
[4:57:18] ThatOneShotBruh: @Diamonita not to be rude, but you kinda just need to play more. Watching content creators who play your role/champs is also immensely helpful.
[4:57:23] lethalbonsai: but you can add me on discord and i can teach you a couple of things
[4:57:44] carlostoon: how it works the double support item?
[4:57:49] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Is that supp item still the same?
[4:57:52] Diamonita: @lethalbonsai that would be really Nice of you!
[4:57:55] lethalbonsai: @carlostoon you help support and support hlps you
[4:58:07] carlostoon: no minions restriction ?
[4:58:14] lethalbonsai: @Diamonita brewski#5655
[4:58:16] ThatOneShotBruh: wait, Q counts as AA? Didn't know that
[4:58:30] lethalbonsai: @carlostoon it is but it nullify each other
[4:58:33] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: When is he playing Hail of Blades Janna guys?
[4:58:41] lethalbonsai: @ThatOneShotBruh yes senna q is counted as aa
[4:58:42] Diamonita: @thatoneshotbruh ive done for years but i dont improve i keep being stupid and making stupid moves and be to inactive and when trying i int..
[4:58:43] Raiverz: Yeah it also cannot crit so lategame it does 1/3 of your auto attack dmg
[4:59:00] carlostoon: @lethalbonsai :O
[4:59:19] Lichyness: wait i missed a lot we're on SENNA?
[4:59:21] Silvah: akali
[4:59:23] Silvah: looool
[4:59:55] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @Raiverz Guinsoo's doesn't replace crit anymore?
[5:00:09] Raiverz: IDK never built it in s14
[5:00:11] lethalbonsai: @Lichyness he got tired of adc from supports and its relaxing and fixing mental
[5:00:19] Lichyness: oh fair
[5:00:35] Lichyness: i went senna arc end of season after tilting and went 100% winrate on her
[5:02:27] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: I went yuumi arc and went 0% winrate :(
[5:02:28] LoL_Qaeda: that was smexy
[5:02:41] surrealoce: its phreak season
[5:02:43] surrealoce: yaya
[5:02:55] Raiverz: Being forced to stay in lane because lanters want to MONKE fight as a support is so annoying
[5:03:16] surrealoce: this season ppl are more clueless then ever
[5:04:03] Raiverz: Bro I s2g leaving so many souls on the ground should be illegal
[5:04:14] starhabit: owo

[5:05:10] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: sponsored league programs are a blight to society
[5:05:26] ender115: @WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo fax
[5:05:27] nyxias999999: malph the only level headed one
[5:05:31] SaltedIIIBlueberries: How she even died on laning phase though seraphine can hard push wave
[5:06:02] Diamonita: whats the Ping thing in chat they removed?
[5:06:05] ThatOneShotBruh: 'low master', said by a low master KEKW
[5:06:15] w0xell_: bait

[5:07:02] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Why did seraphine e randomly at the start
[5:07:05] Raiverz: If only you picked those souls up haha
[5:07:15] GodsonAlm1ghty: dumpster fire!
[5:07:21] mcegginton: Why is this seraphine running enchanter items
[5:07:43] ThatOneShotBruh: but how do you even fuck up the build that much? literally just go to op.gg or whatever and you'll get an infinitely better build
[5:08:00] SaltedIIIBlueberries: As a seraphine mid player etf even that build lol
[5:08:03] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Yes
[5:08:03] DairyChronicle: @IKeepItTaco cupic goes support items on seraphine carry and hes rank 1 na
[5:08:04] IJohNGR: at least she could opgg or ugg or w/e

[5:08:55] Jarc_13: im not defending sera, but rank 1 na is playing sera that way so i think thats why hes doing it
[5:09:08] Silvah: @Jarc_13 cupic?
[5:09:13] Jarc_13: @Silvah yeah
[5:09:15] SaltedIIIBlueberries: He did it on purpose
[5:09:23] matsosdm: you do not talk to her correctly though. in league unless someone has self esteem and can realize mistake on his her own u have to write so politely which is annoying but it is what it is
[5:09:33] w0xell_: flash 4th shot got 4th shot'ed
[5:09:36] ThatOneShotBruh: @DairyChronicle I mean, there is that Chally guy who plays extremely off meta thing top (like Taric or Thresh) and that doesn't mean that others should blindly do that
[5:10:05] Silvah: @Jarc_13 cupic is pretty good on seraphine
[5:10:15] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @Jarc_13 who he?
[5:10:29] Jarc_13: @Silvah yep thats the difference, cupic is really good
[5:10:35] Silvah: cupic is a vtuber and is like always high challenger
[5:10:51] Pachec0v: Pachec0v subscribed with Prime. 
[5:10:54] ThatOneShotBruh: also, Azzapp is building tank VelKoz now, doesn't mean it's a good idea for the average person.
[5:10:55] Silvah: control mage player
[5:11:05] Raiverz: At least this guy is helping seraphine stay unnerfed LMO
[5:11:09] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Did lee

[5:11:22] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Ulti Jax to you
[5:11:23] matsosdm: you do not talk to her correctly though. in league unless someone has self esteem and can realize mistake on his her own u have to write so politely which is annoying but it is what it is

[5:13:18] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: hostage situation tbh
[5:13:36] Jarc_13: @Silvah true, he always goes crazy early on the season
[5:13:37] Klony99: @IKeepItTaco Isn't your refusal to keep trying being nice a sign of you being damaged by high elo aswell? :D
[5:13:39] Syluxrox: why does senna have such a high WR right now? cause of the lethality changes?
[5:13:51] Raiverz: Damn malphite really shoulda ulted that belveth W misinput
[5:13:54] Klony99: Like I get it, and I respect it, I'm just saying. We're all broken people.
[5:13:54] lethalbonsai: @Syluxrox support item carries
[5:14:14] lethalbonsai: she deals like 150% extra dmg with basic attack after marking someone suing ability
[5:14:17] Raiverz: @Syluxrox first of all it actually dropped a lot with the new patch
[5:14:32] Raiverz: Also AP assassins are super easy to deal with if u buy edge of night and everyone plays them
[5:14:42] Raiverz: Support item being strong also helps IG
[5:14:56] dixun_cider: ikeepitLUCY
[5:15:00] lethalbonsai: @IKeepItTaco is edge of night good situational item ?
[5:15:05] matsosdm: what a philosophical discussion about how people think when someone writes rudely and politely🤣 its sad but its true what u said not only about league but the society as well. If u are nice to someone he might f u
[5:15:06] Raiverz: No u need maw
