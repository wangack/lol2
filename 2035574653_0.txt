[4:06:26] aizensosukei: cycle sworx is really good
[4:06:28] LiquidSlimeKnight: you buy it and then the enemy dies
[4:06:33] tmax221: catJAMPARTY Riders on the storm Duuu duuu duu duu du
[4:06:33] UghDragonNinja: lethality is still the same no? just stacking flat armor pen (it's not percent)
[4:06:35] ofvision: Buy Sundered Sky!
[4:06:39] AlexanderTheTired: Supposedly it's just flat armor pen now, and b4 it used to scale it's strength with levels
[4:06:40] Glitchin0_0: Lethality stack now, So instead of it scalling like before it just give you FULL lethality max instantly
[4:07:10] downtoya: i think it's collector next
[4:07:14] Spukkyzz: lethality is now 1 to 1 flat armorpen, it used to be 0.6 to 1 based on level it got buffed by 40% early

[4:08:25] JCp_q: Idk why Lucian rather die then let them have the tower 2v1 LUL

[4:08:33] theafricanpro: @Nightblue3 I really need to know. When do you lock camera ?

[4:08:40] thoughtweft_gambit: @Nightblue3 I just had a yuumi jungle in my game I hope you're happy.
[4:08:43] dr_midir: It means that if u have 10 lethality you'll ignore 10 enemy armor
[4:08:48] Macintoshintyre: if its 1 to 1 with armor pen why not call it armor pen?

[4:09:28] Glitchin0_0: In the past you get 11 lethality from an item and it scale to 18 based on your level. Now it just give you the 18 instantly even if you level 1 and it give more armor penetration
[4:09:31] mttan97: That's what she said
