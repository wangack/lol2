[0:33:47] znowwwy: I agree but just would've been nice if they announce it sooner
[0:33:50] wheeezyp: it certainly opens then window for more people
[0:34:05] slashrhc: will full BFD bis be close to raid ready in p2
[0:34:20] Hunt2103: all it does is delay which week you have to take off from work
[0:34:25] znowwwy: @slashrhc we don't know really
[0:34:34] znowwwy: like the set pieces are gonna be bis i feel for the hit

[0:35:28] Fierceee: River of Darkness is the 🐐
[0:35:35] znowwwy: @slashrhc exactly i think the weapons might actually change tho for warrior and rouge cause how the dmg scaling just works
[0:35:42] znowwwy: but the epic sword will most likely be pre raid bis
[0:35:42] Hunt2103: for casters bfd loot most definitely prebis gnomer

[0:56:34] RascarKapac_: Jeez should I go orc or tauren instead of undead for my war ?
[0:56:36] Hunt2103: this isnt qol
[0:56:37] Thundacles: bladestorm and avatar 100%
[0:56:39] smokesnomoe: bladestorm would be sick
[0:56:43] KonQel: i dont hate that

[0:56:49] HugzGG: giff dual spec
[0:56:50] ShiNe_o: intervene for sure
[0:56:50] Hunt2103: this isnt a minor glyph phase
[0:56:52] Tdoh__: rogues get death grip
[0:56:52] Hunt2103: no shot
[0:56:53] wheeezyp: they put out a wishlist on wowhead

[0:57:02] Fawh: Puke
[0:57:03] Templetacos: Do you whiten your teeth?
[0:57:05] KonQel: I really only need berserkers rage to be happy

[0:58:15] yellowgaiden: unless they do rings and necklace maybe?
[0:58:19] Shepp22: @thundacles just tune up 60 raids
[0:58:26] lampsterof79: Maybe no new runes and just a filler phase
[0:58:32] yellowgaiden: i think its just 8 total
[0:58:33] znowwwy: mayve weapon rune  would be insane
[0:58:50] Shepp22: weapon rune should be like bladestorm, or death grip, etc
[0:58:56] KonQel: Well as a Just Chatter that is what you do
[0:59:02] Kormz__: did you manage to pick up dmf?
[0:59:03] randyr12: maybe they are making everyone so op that it just makes all endgame raids 10 man without changing the 40 man numbers currently
