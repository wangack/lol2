[0:27:36] EIWich0: dont know why
[0:28:38] suppaahh: u dominate top harder than other teemos thats why, they beg for ganks when vs u
[0:28:53] EIWich0: you get camped like 3x times more.

[0:48:06] 514484: JHIN, the famous anti tank adc
[0:48:12] LtChezo: another teemo nerf incoming
[0:51:01] suppaahh: he avoided 2-3 ganks by backing
[0:51:31] ninjapleez: I don't get why they nerfed teemo in the first place. He already has zero one-trick players in challenger
[0:53:04] LtChezo: they are nerfing him for low elo
[0:53:11] CleanKing_: bcuz his wr in the jg is still high
[0:53:15] CleanKing_: ty manco Kappa
[0:53:58] ninjapleez: I wouldn't even mind him as a jg primary role, like what they did with graves
[0:54:18] ninjapleez: They could use his temporary invis from the mobile game and make him a ganker
[0:54:20] EIWich0: yes
[0:55:01] EIWich0: aatrox man
[0:55:14] EIWich0: aatrox does not make any sense
[0:57:59] kablooom: nashors ap% on hit is showing up to be about 28%
[0:59:54] LtChezo: well that might be why they are pushing back teemo asu they might be considering full rework
[1:01:03] LagXel: @LtChezo finally somebody that thought like me
[1:01:22] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: maybe teemo gonna get a mini rework when the visual update comes out
[1:02:00] LagXel: yeah, but maybe they will do the same thing that they did with Ahri and Jax, Midscope update and then ASU
[1:02:17] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: besides that the visual update was announced for late 2023 do someone have an info about that ?
[1:02:24] LtChezo: @ipav999 teemo's ASU has been pushed back and they are gonna announce something later this year so they might midscope if not full rework
[1:02:25] YolkBun: MYAAA
[1:04:08] Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku: for a mini rework i would like that: Q procs poison, poison procs items like liandry (like every other poison in the game except this one), and a little attack speed buff when you activate the Z
[1:04:08] Der_Angelord: 9 items D:
[1:04:13] kablooom: would have to maximize his abilities to kill
[1:04:27] LagXel: @Le_Bazar_De_LOtaku they said Teemo ASU was for late 2023, but they encountered some "difficulties" and he will be delayed, the thing is, whay inconvenient could they have while doing some VISUAL rework, i think that maybe they are doing a midscope with the ASU, like something out of nowhere
[1:04:32] Sayadae: i enjoy teemo so much but i feel like i cant really carry
[1:05:29] MeruWing: moral support
[1:05:43] MeruWing: :)
[1:05:48] istroopy: @ipav999 toughts on teemo with supp item? the zak zak something
[1:05:57] kablooom: ask the silver players they will say yes
[1:06:14] LagXel: one of Teemo problems is that, his shrooms are so usefull for the team, and they are nerfing them now LUL
[1:07:18] Sayadae: what is ur opinion on teemo support?
[1:07:34] kablooom: the blind duration should be 3s lvl 1
[1:08:10] lebioda22: uh is this chinese server?
[1:08:35] hamzajamal25: Yepge
[1:10:05] kablooom: if only turret plate gold was the same
[1:10:16] Leetmmoman: its hard to fully utilize teemos kit in teamfights. his only outplay is preparation before the fight
[1:11:04] kablooom: it feels like teemo has to perma farm to feel useful
[1:11:23] Qubbematic: Blind should last 1 seconds in the river and 6 seconds on dry ground running into river cures blindness in 1 second
[1:11:27] LitheIXO: go dj go

[1:18:09] kablooom: 1 item shadowflame allows you to one auto ranged minions.
[1:18:14] SpringSong: they gona buff karma Q and E %20 ap ratio and they give her flat hp too ap tank karma already strong and they are buff her huge amount and they nerf teemo :(
[1:19:22] teamwillow: If they increase teemo ult CD they should at least make shrooms last more than 3 mins. cuz everyone gets free red sweepers now etc
[1:20:06] Sayadae: arent they lasting 5 minutes?
[1:20:23] kablooom: thought i saw 5min
[1:20:25] SpringSong: they just need to remove that free 2 stack red trinket

[2:38:38] Pitju99: when I saw the number changes before the season I knew tankmo was dead
[2:38:46] tboneshorty: why did they take away the charged attacks counter?
[2:39:16] morra282: tahm kench used it, but it worked with his passive
[2:39:18] Pitju99: some champs were relying on heartsteel but not meta champs, wouldnt call it abusing
[2:39:22] suppaahh: even less people were grabbing wormogs
[2:39:28] Pitju99: they needed it to not be garbage
[2:39:29] morra282: I don't think it was a big deal, just people crying
[2:39:31] jg__gapped: it was broken on sion mundo tbh
[2:40:07] morra282: It was just designed for them tbh
[2:40:08] Pitju99: ir's not abusing an item if they need it to function
[2:40:35] LtChezo: i just think they were scared of it being abused with mythics gone, like anyone could build it and just tack it onto their dmg build
[2:41:46] Pitju99: @ltchezo they don't understand how terrible it is not to build it first
[2:42:39] LtChezo: its for sure over nerfed
[2:42:58] Pitju99: if I'm an adc and want tankiness I go jaksho not this crap

[5:22:45] NeverBeenBearder: I learned a little bit of Mandarin when I used to live in Taiwan. I used to teach English there for a few years
[5:24:06] NeverBeenBearder: It will be interesting for sure to say the least
[5:24:22] NeverBeenBearder: I agree with the fact that it seems to be taking the same stance/moves as Hong Kong
[5:25:20] NeverBeenBearder: It's strange that Lai is very much Taiwan being independent but at the same time saying that Taiwan doesn't have to declare independence from China.
[5:25:40] NeverBeenBearder: Yeah haha, I only learned traditional Mandarin. I never dabbled in other languages or dialects.
[5:26:18] NeverBeenBearder: Simplified is much easier though when it comes to writing

[5:27:54] doktordingerdonger: i realized how many words are similar in korean, chinese and viet
[5:28:22] NeverBeenBearder: There is also Taiwanese Mandarin as well, its usually referred to as Guoyu
[5:29:18] NeverBeenBearder: It honestly got very confusing in Taiwan when learning Mandarin. There were so many dialects and me being a white  boy from Canada, everyone was confused when I spoke LUL
[5:30:29] BlaZiixx: Is it korean or chinese?
[5:31:00] NeverBeenBearder: Yeah, it took me about 6 months of being there to finally start understanding basic conversations. First while when I was there, I would just point to things on a menu to order food lol
[5:31:10] BlaZiixx: I know it is not russian ahaha - but isn't there a difference bettwen those to ( korean v chinese)
[5:31:13] NeverBeenBearder: But everyone was so friendly when I was there, everyone wanted to help teach me

[8:06:26] LetTheScoutCook: hopefuly they revert
[8:06:42] berliouz1: nah its never worked this way for teemo
[8:07:03] Ellipsoul: Sadge
[8:07:05] LetTheScoutCook: because i somewhat believe they balance the game around teemo

[8:09:33] LetTheScoutCook: so many ppl in emerald now
[8:09:37] LetTheScoutCook: cuz of this
[8:10:52] LetTheScoutCook: ahh good point

[8:26:39] SpringSong: @EdgarVonRutentuten cause he strooong KEKW
[8:27:01] EdgarVonRutentuten: It's an item issue, that's it, but ofc Teemo gets the kneejerk nerf
[8:27:08] LetTheScoutCook: yes
[8:27:10] LetTheScoutCook: correct
[8:27:23] LetTheScoutCook: they wont realize until they gut teemo to 30%

[8:29:44] SpringSong: and vlad is finee teemo the one who need get nerfed
[8:30:09] LetTheScoutCook: u can put like 30 shrooms on map at the time.. with Live patch
[8:30:32] LetTheScoutCook: with new patch its about 20
[8:30:38] berliouz1: jax will try to carry this Pav )
[8:31:14] LetTheScoutCook: teemo is the 2nd best late game champ rn
[8:31:16] LetTheScoutCook: top
[8:31:21] LetTheScoutCook: kayle first
[8:31:31] 200KMHBLINKERLINKS: @LetTheScoutCook maybe then just skip building malignance ?
[8:31:36] LetTheScoutCook: nah
[8:31:39] berliouz1: tell this too varus )
[8:31:43] LetTheScoutCook: malignance is must.. atleast for late game
[8:31:51] LetTheScoutCook: u dont have shrooms without it
[8:32:11] 200KMHBLINKERLINKS: @LetTheScoutCook i mean for core, you can still build it after
[8:32:19] LetTheScoutCook: and shrooms are vision and control.. what makes teemo late game so good
[8:32:39] LetTheScoutCook: nashor first is better so you can farm much better
[8:32:44] LetTheScoutCook: malignance second
[8:33:03] LetTheScoutCook: farming without attack speed is pain
[8:33:07] berliouz1: nope
[8:33:18] Ellipsoul: KEKW KEKW KEKW KEKW
[8:33:21] berliouz1: hmmm

[8:33:58] Ellipsoul: I don't think you can click abilities out of the screen
[8:34:03] 200KMHBLINKERLINKS: @LetTheScoutCook enemy team just needs two oracles and all shrooms are gone pre min 20
[8:34:06] topposan2000: nice bait from bird
[8:35:03] LetTheScoutCook: nah.. its not enough.. and even if they buy oracles... if u put shrooms in front of drake.. they have to clear shrooms or commit to mine field.. it takes a lot of time to clear them.. so its win win
[8:35:27] LetTheScoutCook: just dont put shrooms too early
[8:35:28] currysos: can not believe that ipav didnt use his flash :)
[8:35:36] SpringSong: and still teemo the one who need nerf lmfao
[8:35:37] currysos: at that fight
[8:36:36] berliouz1: looks like gg
[8:36:57] LetTheScoutCook: ye teemo needs nerf cuz silver players dont know how to build MR XD
[8:37:13] LetTheScoutCook: and when u vers diamond who can build MR.. you are done
[8:37:21] LetTheScoutCook: nerfs 200 iq
[8:37:30] EdgarVonRutentuten: Only his itemization needs nerfing, like malignance
[8:37:36] LetTheScoutCook: yea
[8:37:45] EdgarVonRutentuten: And there's one very easy fix to that
[8:37:46] berliouz1: for riot silver way more important than master+
[8:37:54] EdgarVonRutentuten: Add a 10s cooldown to Malignance's passive
[8:37:55] LetTheScoutCook: i let like 20 comments under phreak patch review video
[8:38:05] EdgarVonRutentuten: Should remove double shroom dmg entirely from malignance
[8:38:17] EdgarVonRutentuten: Within 10s all shroom dot is gone
[8:38:23] EdgarVonRutentuten: And any residual dmg from liandry as well
[8:38:25] berliouz1: tilted af LUL
[8:38:29] Blackenedd: why doenst ipav do the new intes?
[8:38:32] SpringSong: @berliouz1 yea cuz comparing to amount of player in master+ and silver gold there huge different
[8:38:42] berliouz1: exact
[8:38:57] LetTheScoutCook: sad
[8:39:17] berliouz1: bronze silver like 70% of players
[8:39:18] LetTheScoutCook: i will leave league and noone cares..... cuz im not silver
[8:39:56] Ellipsoul: Kayle monkaS
[8:40:02] LetTheScoutCook: there is not much u can do if teemo drops to 47% win rate.. he has like zero outplay potential.. he is not zed or idk..
[8:40:24] TyG_: hello mr ipav what do you think of mr teemo being nerfed
[8:40:40] TyG_: and hello mr chat Gladge
[8:40:45] SpringSong: @LetTheScoutCook its not about that they are making buff and nerf based around where is the more popularity are silver gold is more of the player base so they consider to buff around there
[8:40:51] KrisTeemoTTV: Which first item is more effective on Teemo in This season?
[8:41:05] razer_mon: u next ipav runnn
[8:41:22] DeadlyBoy1234: teemo getting nerfed again!!!!
[8:41:32] LetTheScoutCook: @KrisTeemoTTV nashor if u aim for late game, malignance if u need shroomfest earlier
[8:41:45] 200KMHBLINKERLINKS: @LetTheScoutCook its also around proplay. Also they want specific champs to be meta buffing them
[8:41:52] LetTheScoutCook: yea
[8:42:01] LetTheScoutCook: disgusting politics
[8:42:47] SpringSong: lol
[8:43:03] SpringSong: sona can get x2 her hp shield okey riot that totally normal

[8:43:16] LetTheScoutCook: xd
[8:43:30] LetTheScoutCook: atrox with sundered sky... lets nerf teemo
[8:43:35] KrisTeemoTTV: New items are so expensive with the exception of nashor. And you can build for ages
[8:43:55] SpringSong: lmfao that xerath ult KEKW
[8:44:23] shamybg: this vlad is so bad
[8:45:04] vladaah: how is teemo hardmode?
[8:45:25] berliouz1: most funny thing is varus and vayne wich terorizing master+ for months and riot actually doesnt care about it
[8:45:33] SpringSong: I hate eve and shaco and kha so much -.-'
[8:45:43] shamybg: why no  terminus
[8:45:53] 200KMHBLINKERLINKS: lets see how long it takes for riot until they notice the items are the problem LUL
[8:45:58] SpringSong: @berliouz1 cuz ppl love to watch them in lcs etc
[8:49:31] forg1vens04: wouldnt a riftmaker make so much sense in this build ?
[8:51:00] razer_mon: gg
[8:52:01] razer_mon: too much healing
[8:52:11] berliouz1: you played well Pav
[8:52:38] SpringSong: ur team need anti healing
[8:53:17] SpringSong: eve could go to finish nexus
[8:53:17] LetTheScoutCook: honestly.. i found biggest succces just building items that directly counters enemy... whatever..even if u build frozen heart into yas yone yi...
[8:53:21] forg1vens04: if playing an on hit ad build is bloodline better?
[8:53:54] shamybg: yes
[8:54:00] randyr12: teemo is banned like very game now

[8:55:04] berliouz1: did we report cait?
[8:55:16] shamybg: its normals
[8:55:47] LetTheScoutCook: I mean.. with new nerfs.. making it super hard for teemo in high elo.. isnt it just better to compare yourself to other teemo in worlds? rather than just rank overall?
[8:57:15] LetTheScoutCook: best teemo world is better title than being d1 or grandmaster to me.. rn
[8:57:33] berliouz1: really hard to compare climbing with playing for fun and satisfaction . just two dif type of gamong
[8:58:17] LetTheScoutCook: read comment above
[8:58:21] shamybg: you can be a chall teemo player but a diamond/master player as a hole
[8:58:26] LetTheScoutCook: ah.. ok
[8:59:20] LetTheScoutCook: i mean. climbing with these nerfs will be harder.. so i will focus more on climbing the teemo ladder rather than elo ladder..
[8:59:32] LetTheScoutCook: thats what i meant
[8:59:51] LetTheScoutCook: ok :D
[9:00:13] LetTheScoutCook: i played normals for half a year.. and i had good fun.. sudenly

[9:24:46] LetTheScoutCook: if we talking dmg teemo
[9:25:02] LetTheScoutCook: i dont think E 5% nerf will do anything so they will keep nerfing
[9:25:10] LetTheScoutCook: until he is 49% wr in iron
[9:25:17] LetTheScoutCook: and 25% wr in dia
