[2:03:45] nikator1: There was a recent study conducted at Harvard over the course of a decade to determine the best form of random generator. After countless experiments with Psuedo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) and True Random Generators (TRNGs) the scientists decided that neither were true random. To find true random, they found the most efficient form of generation was queueing Emerald elo League of Legends games. They were astounded at how truly random it was. 󠀀

[3:50:04] YamiDragoon: @Maeg If you're jungle is getting objectives and helping other lanes carry then it could POSSIBLY be fun
[3:50:20] jojayjoo: the gragaas had quite a few items too while not even jungling, just sitting in a bush camping your lane
[3:51:43] YamiDragoon: Yeah people play like vaginas if you're the only one strong
[3:51:53] k1ddv1pp: wang, can u tell me a good counter for riven top?
[3:52:06] TkMill: about to quit this game. Nobody groups for objectives everybody just chases enemies like its call of duty

[3:53:34] chronwalk: Kench is also good too...
[3:53:34] Rendchewer: Funny you say that, I find that after a long break from the game, coming back and playing super casually has been a lot more enjoyable.  I still do ranked, only up to Emerald at this point, but there's no stress about pushing further, just games here and there to enjoy.
[3:54:19] k1ddv1pp: thanks for the responses
[3:54:31] Galkaria: normals are complete garbage since the toxic fucks got dumped there, every normal game is just 3 toxic pieces of shit trying to end the game ASAP
[3:54:37] YamiDragoon: enemy chose yorick, what do now?
[3:54:38] itszat0ichi: AP Jax Pog
[3:54:45] Rendchewer: I mean, casually as in play on my own but only a few games at a time.  I don't sit and grind games over and over.  That long break brought back the enjoyment, and I maintain it by not playing a lot of games.  I play ranked almost exclusively.
[3:55:16] Rendchewer: rip teemo
[3:55:21] Proverbs_: but how do you get 4 other friends
