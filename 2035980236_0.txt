[0:14:00] lightheadtv: sub!
[0:14:04] archie7497: Despite the fact that t1 won this match this Lucian was turbo useless. Also they didn't even properly do the double support tech. Molecule pointed it out on Twitter that guma spent majority of the game in the support item gold penalty zone
[0:14:05] james310x: Yes I

[0:18:41] killerwhalekj: did u prewatch this series
[0:19:04] MissingMatter: I think it's probably reporting each individually then all three as a group.
[0:19:10] asqqi: what is your opinion on the new terrain changes especially with regards to roaming @MonteCristo
[0:19:12] moaxlrex: I think it represents 3 grubs plus the "camp" as a whole
[0:20:02] defilerz: @ReapersArk Faker's been known to just play the same stuff over and over that's comfortable with
[0:21:08] defilerz: redside feels rlly bad
[0:21:09] Lamynator: oh, your camera's covering part of the minimap in case that matters to you
[0:21:24] pikapikanomii: it's not fun to play in soloq thats for sure
[0:21:48] Jeffp2662: I wish they would move little bits of terrain more often. Every few patches move a bush or a wall.
[0:21:57] Lamynator: I guess LCK respects their viewers enough to want them to look at the map
[0:22:49] zen__cloud: do you like the new tank MR items monte?

[0:27:18] DrIsaac: you sure you wouldnt want them to play for the glorious TSM when they one day make theri way back into LCS? seems pretty Pog to me
[0:27:31] asqqi: would you dissuade your children from pursuing a career in esports as a player/broadcaster/other personality?
[0:27:31] Sodo_Mojo: the best part is 2 of them could still claim NA residence to get the bag later
[0:27:40] MissingMatter: Team Suspiciously Missing

[0:29:05] imainleesin: LUL
[0:29:54] lazink: my experience with parents as agents, is horrible, parents too invested
[0:29:55] doggo01610: just nerf ksante to the ground pls like yuumi, it is so braindead and unskilled
[0:29:59] archie7497: I know that saved lehends there but isn't mikaels really inefficient this game? If you get cc'd by neeko you are most likely dead
[0:30:18] mainanalyst: @lazink yeah even Hamilton had to sack his dad at one stage
[0:30:31] phinvincible: flashbang out

[0:31:11] mainanalyst: rip
[0:31:45] PaddiV: does it stack?
[0:31:56] archie7497: @montecristo the Lucian did piss damage even with bloodsong. Also molecule counted guma's cs numbers and found out that he spent most of the time in gold income penalty zone.
[0:33:18] Cipherflare: Are the casters the cameraman? @montecristo

[0:33:44] lazink: aren't the observeres usually retired pros?
[0:33:45] Elysian_Shine: Seems like 2x adc bot lane got giga buffed by the new support items right? Wonder how that will play out in the future
[0:33:45] Rgb14: atlas is giga chad
[0:33:47] Giiino: how does one become a pro observer?

[0:36:00] Rgb14: vision is the most op thing in this game
[0:36:05] hypxrbeam: they can also take 4-5 sweepers
[0:36:14] Combusttion: I member when junglers got sightstone for free with the jungle item @MonteCristo
[0:36:14] WatarieTV: Boomers remember sightstone jungler meta
[0:36:26] kayyslol: I still would prefer the kraken build tbh
[0:36:53] mainanalyst: Nunu poachers smite.... yummy
[0:37:07] Shanarru: we are calling sightstone back in the day? i feel old now
[0:37:08] Deadriller: he has the FRC
[0:37:31] mainanalyst: supports have it too easy these days
[0:37:35] Elysian_Shine: Do you think junglers with sightstone was better or worse for the game?
[0:37:40] Clyde1500: @Shanarru hasn't sightstone been out of the game longer than it was in the game?
[0:37:42] WatarieTV: @Shanarru it was literally 7 years ago, what would you refer to it as?
[0:37:56] Shanarru: something that doesnt make me feel old....
[0:37:59] del1nquency: 5 sweepers... how are you even supposed to play against that

[0:50:19] MethmM: that neeko ult was filthy
[0:50:20] Sodo_Mojo: 4 man flag and drag bought so much time for the flank
[0:51:03] Shanarru: @MonteCristo is there a reason i dont understand about why korean players go to china every year but chinese players never come over to korea
[0:51:23] h0urze: the exhaust on faker was too slow
[0:51:23] MrHandsomeNoodle: @Shanarru money
[0:51:34] nalganeitor: money most likely
[0:51:48] gorwings: that was a great pop blossom
[0:52:40] Lamynator: Korea also has an unreal amount of patriotism, the teams would probably get a lot of heat hiring foreign even if the talent wouldn't have language issues
[0:52:46] pblack: faker ran it game two

[0:53:13] h0urze: uzi is oldge though
[0:53:19] Shanarru: just came to mind because some of the chinese junglers play a really proactive style that i feel like would have fit better in gen G
[0:53:35] Fire_elemen6: They instead send agents to learn the LPL secrets in a year long training exercise to then come back and teach it to LCK
[0:54:09] torgoat: why is vi banned?

[0:57:54] maletroll: have we come to a conclusion whether udyr is good or not
[0:58:14] jerckysminion: udyr is good atleast in korea he has been in solo Q a high priority champ for junglers
[0:58:18] Aoyos_: @jerckysminion the builds have been atrocious for what udyr is supposed to do in pro play
[0:58:25] Riqui__: I was really hoping for Lilia there
[0:58:26] nalganeitor: @maletroll udyr is like nicolas cage
[0:58:27] thatduderobert: monka S kai
[0:58:30] xoceozcar: do you think they would just put kiin on Ksante for a couple of games to really validate the flex for later in the season? or is kiin already a pretty solid ksante player?
[0:58:37] TorenthalStreams: It's bad
[0:58:38] Desunotoo: Why is udyr so high prio now

[0:59:03] arthradot: it was hyping up an AP carry jg and bleh. maokai
[0:59:04] gorwings: karthus?

[1:03:54] Sodo_Mojo: @PKuall4life player's bodies, it's already an injuryfest and most super bowls are determined by who is less injured
[1:03:59] TorenthalStreams: Do you think Faker will move to support role as he reaches his grey-haired phase in the next few years
[1:04:05] PKuall4life: @Aoyos_ so you mean to tell me if the Eagles pulled a G2 and run the lower bracket?
[1:04:05] ThatLatvianGuy: atlus did reflections with thorin, got some good info on his arrival at lck
[1:04:07] mainanalyst: Hysterics is #1 though
[1:04:11] PKuall4life: also, Cross Confrence lower bracket
[1:04:15] Rgb14: atlas and valdez are super funny
[1:04:19] MissingMatter: @PKuall4life Game scarcity is part of the NFL's business plan, tbh.
[1:04:20] xoceozcar: you gave him a fridge no?
[1:04:31] jerckysminion: correct he does have a reflections interview up
[1:04:45] lazink: Is there a caster from the sports scene you'd like to hear cast a league game? Mine would be Doc Emrick
[1:05:06] gorwings: atlus i thought got the grill
[1:05:13] PKuall4life: so is there a world in the sports industry where double elim could work? Like going from upper to lower you get like a week off just to heal
[1:05:20] Aoyos_: @sodo_mojo if players' bodies were a priority they wouldn't be having more and more games outside of the country

[1:05:37] maletroll: udyr's base dmg is getting nerfed surely
[1:05:51] jerckysminion: Jack Buck always loved that man's voice on baseball
[1:05:55] thatduderobert: @montecristo so what do you do these days besides twitch?
[1:05:56] MissingMatter: Mike Lange, but just because I miss Mike Lange casting my Pens games.
[1:06:26] EmbryoVacation: John Madden would be great
[1:06:34] gorwings: i wish other leagues would take after some of the LEC overlay options.
[1:06:38] jerckysminion: john madden is a goat caster really
[1:06:43] MissingMatter: John Madden would've circled those signs Monte pointed out.
[1:06:51] Riqui__: not greeding for the cannon there like larssen
[1:07:00] pblack: pretty much
[1:07:14] PKuall4life: John Sterling when a Series Finishes
[1:07:23] PKuall4life: THE HERETICS WIN
[1:07:42] thatduderobert: podcast nerd! ‚ù§Ô∏è
[1:07:44] Sodo_Mojo: @Aoyos_ my guy my favorite sports team travels more than any other team in the league and we've never been to a world championship, but nobody ever cares about travel distance until it's convient for their argument
[1:07:46] Aoyos_: If you go full tank Udyr you also don't have a sidelane pressure later on because he takes towers slowly, he needs Hullbreaker to make up for it. Fast wave push but not structure damage
[1:08:08] jerckysminion: @Aoyos_ aye that indeed
[1:08:44] thatduderobert: @montecristo do you have a favorite podcast you do?
[1:08:47] maletroll: wonder what will happen after that LCK sustainability statement
[1:08:48] jerckysminion: this udyr is gonna pop off soon
[1:08:51] jerckysminion: i can feel it
[1:09:09] Riqui__: With gauntlet he is a lot less kitable
[1:09:16] ThatLatvianGuy: @maletroll some promises, and then nothing
[1:09:19] Aoyos_: Udyr's just a CC slave with full tank builds and can't even force out Ksan'te after that MR item that gives a shield
[1:09:35] Dnomes: @Aoyos_ Disagree, the voidchuds is kind of easy for him to apply and I think he is happy pulling people to wherever he is walking, but it does feel anti-synergistic with the rest of the team
[1:09:37] mainanalyst: IWD tech
[1:09:39] thatduderobert: i always thought udyr was garbage ü§£üò±
[1:09:52] whitecrayonlol: Is Udyr the new Singed? Just running around carefree
[1:09:52] jerckysminion: man atleast 1 damage item on the udyr would be nice
[1:10:05] Aoyos_: @Dnomes Even with void bonus damage it's too slow to apply heavy pressure
[1:10:10] Dnomes: ??
[1:10:12] Giiino: what is udyr right now man
[1:10:19] jerckysminion: omg
[1:10:23] gorwings: the tank slap fest
[1:10:23] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:10:29] whitecrayonlol: Eventually kekw
[1:10:32] jerckysminion: this udyr is so absurd lmao
[1:10:34] anomalous_autumn: hahaha
[1:10:39] jemerzmiles: yeah riot needs to nerf that
[1:10:40] killerwhalekj: fix the game
[1:10:40] Dnomes: 6 chuds is a lot of dmg, he is not supposed to spam hit the tower - he just wants to apply it once every 4 seconds while acting as a neutralizing force for his opponent
[1:10:42] hyptnoticgt: dom udyr in action!
[1:10:47] archie7497: I'm surprised teams are still picking maokai. It was poke+ult but with the removal of demonic he is just a ult bot
[1:10:55] Dnomes: SKT should be guaranteed getting all 6 due to the Udyr pick
[1:11:16] GPAlexander: i hate that zeus goes full tank in this game
[1:11:17] Aoyos_: @Dnomes If the pick only works when you get all 6 chuds then there's not enough merit to pick it because anyone with 6 chuds is a lot of damage
[1:11:17] jerckysminion: that is such a good play
[1:11:25] jerckysminion: he dragged over 3 people
[1:11:26] whitecrayonlol: Managed to stay alive 15 seconds after he killed Ksante wtf
[1:11:34] jerckysminion: got the kill for first blood
[1:11:42] maletroll: the udyr W with passive sustain is massive
[1:11:52] Dnomes: @Aoyos_ Yes, but Udyr guarantees permapush in toplane, K'Sante cant move for the 2v2 or 3v3 - so why should they not get all 6 grubbers?
[1:11:55] imainleesin: remember when tabis had dodge LUL
[1:11:55] Imaslapyou: Was there any news on Faker's recovery from the wrist injury with the player break?
[1:11:55] arimftw: how is chat this stupid, udyr has been this strong for almost 2 years, ls has been begging pro players to play it
[1:12:09] Rgb14: that ward
[1:12:12] Rgb14: omg
[1:12:12] brandofan2: he also used W
[1:12:17] brandofan2: to get behind him
[1:12:30] Riqui__: when did Oner get in that brush?
[1:12:34] jerckysminion: it's literally high prio in korean solo Q n banned out a lot these days
[1:12:44] killerwhalekj: that was tiktok lee sin play
[1:12:56] later_buddy: Oner even walked in the direction Chovy was going to w to
[1:12:59] later_buddy: wow
[1:13:01] Aoyos_: @Dnomes Because for that you also need a winning 2v2 for jungle mid and there's no comeback mechanic if you don't get 6
[1:13:27] Dnomes: Yes, but you can also use the same argument for drake-stacking comps etc. etc. etc., so that is not really valid
[1:13:40] GPAlexander: have you already seen the series monte?
[1:13:43] jerckysminion: late game probably they will group up for udyr front tank
[1:13:59] Aoyos_: It's valid, don't get why you want to pretend you can ignore glaring weaknesses
[1:14:43] tox1cman90: prob "good catch"
[1:15:00] gorwings: those observers love the tank slap fight
[1:15:12] jerckysminion: top tower should be down first i think
[1:15:20] jerckysminion: zeus can jsut keep pushing so far
[1:15:35] jerckysminion: the udyr sustain :p

[1:16:31] Giiino: liar liar gotta be too niche of a reference for most people
[1:16:53] Rgb14: i thought atlas was Australian?
[1:16:54] Dnomes: 2.3k gold, is the most busted item in the game
[1:17:04] Riqui__: the other caster is Dutch
[1:17:13] Rgb14: ohhh kk
[1:17:16] jerckysminion: oner caught out
[1:17:16] commando1814: phreak was saying f hart might be the most gold efficient giga tank item
[1:17:16] PKuall4life: I wanna see the noodle fight
[1:17:19] Ho1ograms: yeah it 2.2 k gold for fh
[1:17:24] PKuall4life: Udyr v Maokai
[1:17:36] GPAlexander: i miss having 90 armor on FH
[1:17:54] commando1814: the shredding of atk speed is nice
[1:17:55] pblack: i feel like t1 has  vision problem with this new map cuz in this game and the next they kept getting caught out way too much
[1:18:00] jerckysminion: should up it to 2.8 or 2.9k i guess
[1:18:20] commando1814: udy is back on ap bastard split duty
[1:18:27] Fire_elemen6: Frozen heart, oppressive when it's cheap, never
[1:18:33] Riqui__: There might be some Hydra Udyrs coming aswell in LCS
[1:18:39] Riqui__: titanic
[1:18:39] MissingMatter: Plates were 10 to 1
[1:18:56] jerckysminion: haven't seen any hydra udyr's yet but that be interesting
[1:18:56] PKuall4life: and they didnt cash in on the 1
[1:19:22] MissingMatter: Trist went up to deal with Udyr and Azir just ripped up mid turret.
[1:19:33] kerokerogrips: wait  how could the best team in the world lose a game ?
[1:19:37] jerckysminion: top gonna fall soon
[1:19:44] Aoyos_: Udyr struggles so much to break the passive shield from Kaenic Rookern
[1:19:48] toddasaur: I remember when you used to use Azir soldiers directly on turret.. that was so long ago
[1:19:57] Dauntedjungle: Dauntedjungle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:20:14] commando1814: who is going to be the 4-5th place team that is the wildcard of chaos ?
[1:20:21] tox1cman90: love that sub alert
[1:20:30] Aoyos_: I don't even play the game anymore lmao
[1:20:32] holypally_IC: holypally_IC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! <3

[1:20:44] Aoyos_: 12 secs cd on the shield
[1:20:48] TorenthalStreams: KERIA???
[1:20:53] Aoyos_: But the shield is 20% of max hp
[1:21:08] Esterifikace: such a funny flash
[1:21:08] jerckysminion: inhib turret down is good
[1:21:11] Rgb14: they should have finished off the inhib...
[1:21:18] Rgb14: die for it
[1:22:35] jerckysminion: they died for their greed
[1:22:38] arthradot: rip
[1:22:57] SonsOfJarvan: GENG is winning worlds, i dont accept "chokers" comms outta t1 meatriders
[1:22:58] GPAlexander: inhib towers aren't even worth a lot of gold
[1:22:59] jerckysminion: i think they could
[1:23:01] Riqui__: but 17 min inhib prob ouldnt even be that good for them
[1:23:07] zen__cloud: with the enemy positioning they could've just gotten the inhib
[1:23:09] Aoyos_: Thing is you saw the exact same issue in game 1 of this series. Gwen was poking down Ksante out of lane with a series of short engages but once the Kaenic Rookern was finished Gwen could no longer stay in lane because breaking the shield was a full Gwen rotation minus ult. The situation with Udyr is the same
[1:23:17] pblack: 17 min inhib wouldve fed tristana wave after wave
[1:23:26] tox1cman90: @SonsOfJarvan what happened a few months ago? LUL
[1:23:34] Fire_elemen6: Zeus also builds like he's not sure what he wants to do this game
[1:23:49] SonsOfJarvan: This is a SUPPERTEAM, not a midtable roster with doran peanut and delight xd
[1:23:50] TorenthalStreams: @SonsOfJarvan if geng wins worlds im eating a shoe. Choke masters
[1:23:57] Dnomes: @Aoyos_ How can you type that, when you just say you didn't play the game lol
[1:23:59] killerwhalekj: faker just ran it down in this game
[1:24:00] Aoyos_: Chovy could have used TP at base
[1:24:03] Dnomes: insae lol
[1:24:15] Aoyos_: @Dnomes ????? I have eyes
[1:24:32] Aoyos_: You don't need to play to see what's happening
[1:25:43] pblack: i think rell woulve been a better pick here than lee sin for a better guarantee on getting the backline

[1:25:56] SonsOfJarvan: HLE DK and T1 were "supposed" to be better than GENG last year, they werent, now GENG bring GOAT jugnler, top who fills well the tank playstyle, and well, brother lehends, that is one of the weirdest but succesfully good
[1:26:18] Aoyos_: Isn't it the same as Sion ult drifting by spamming stop
[1:26:19] jerckysminion: tower hould be done for next wave i think
[1:26:54] TorenthalStreams: I DONT KNOW WHERE YOURE GOING BUT DO YOU GOT ROOM FOR ONE MORE TROUBLED SOUL AlienDance AlienDance AlienDance
[1:27:04] SonsOfJarvan: U can see the lack of SYNERGY throughtout the games BUT THEY STILL MANAGE TO WIN xd, thats what make CHAMPIONS
[1:27:05] GPAlexander: Im just waiting for them to figure out how disgusting hullbreaker is
[1:27:08] jerckysminion: wouldn't soul get easier if they took down the t1 tower in mid for em?
[1:27:26] Aoyos_: @GPAlexander 100% and on Udyr it's even stronger due to the shield scaling
[1:27:45] Riqui__: LuL
[1:27:46] Giiino: LUL
[1:27:47] Rgb14: lollz
[1:27:47] riley_bruce_: thats awesome haha
[1:27:48] jerckysminion: LUL
[1:27:53] TorenthalStreams: kekw
[1:27:59] Cipherflare: you know the 3 different baron? @montecristo
[1:28:10] jerckysminion: mid tower will drop now i guess
[1:28:34] Rgb14: bowling alley baron
[1:28:36] maletroll: best botlane worlds getting gapped
[1:28:37] TorenthalStreams: xdd
[1:28:48] MissingMatter: Are these the OnKillGrabbyBaron names?
[1:28:49] SonsOfJarvan: As always, PEYZ is gumas dad
[1:29:07] Fire_elemen6: Eyeball baron, c'thulu baron, and baron baron
[1:29:10] jerckysminion: maokai pick working out
[1:29:17] SonsOfJarvan: Only KR to win BOTH ROOKIE SPLITS, Guma didnt even made worlds in his rookie season xd
[1:29:19] GPAlexander: canyon is canyoning oner
[1:29:26] TorenthalStreams: I think bot lane should move to mid lane to contest grubs
[1:29:33] SonsOfJarvan: KR ADC
[1:29:43] kalavine: haven't played this season, what's the consensus on the map changes? good/bad or w/e
[1:29:48] pblack: this is sick from oner
[1:29:49] Phaetox: Agreed but I hated everyone on maokai sej
[1:30:01] Esterifikace: oh its happening
[1:30:08] jerckysminion: here we go
[1:30:12] arthradot: classic
[1:30:21] Flukeytwitch: so clean

[1:30:47] Dollt28: lmao
[1:30:47] Komarimasita: oh my god i loved pacific rim
[1:30:55] jerckysminion: this is a vod, this was played earlier today
[1:30:57] mrpac28: lol great movie
[1:30:58] SonsOfJarvan: U can see 5 mins later T1 MENTALBOOMIN trynna do THE SAME PLAY EVERY 2 MINS xd
[1:31:14] SonsOfJarvan: Faker Rin dying instantly
[1:31:24] TorenthalStreams: PogBones
[1:31:35] zen__cloud: faker was moving mid lee ult which is sick
[1:31:37] ThatLatvianGuy: faker/oner combo named rimjob SeemsGood
[1:31:47] Aoyos_: 3 flashes up and no one used any to avoid the chain
[1:31:56] TorenthalStreams: insane play actually
[1:32:03] jerckysminion: @SonsOfJarvan i hope your joking some of us come here to watch the games with the people who haven't watched it spoilers are a cunt
[1:32:08] KevnPaik: that timing
[1:32:25] captn_loot: i think its fair to ask a pro to make that reaction
[1:32:27] Phaetox: Oner plays are jump scares for ADCs
[1:32:34] SonsOfJarvan: Who hasnt watch a game so important that occurred 20 hrs ago
[1:32:35] captn_loot: oner lee sin goated though
[1:32:51] jerckysminion: this happened earlier today u mad fuck
[1:32:54] Rgb14: gumi shoulda have went mid with udyr for inhib.. lol
[1:32:55] ThatLatvianGuy: @captn_loot if you wanna look at reaction speed look at saken vs mdk
[1:33:11] whitecrayonlol: Oner and Faker was fun to watch in arena
[1:33:14] SonsOfJarvan: it started 20 h ago xd, well technically 19
[1:33:22] Fire_elemen6: Imagine if Zeus had split push items too instead of being teqmfight udyr
[1:33:26] mrpac28: so much trust there too from one to faker
[1:33:31] JOEHOGE: @SonsOfJarvan 4 asm my time ofc i didnt watch it
[1:33:32] PKuall4life: @MonteCristo what is the hotkey to move the video frame by frame?
[1:33:37] dianstyle: Uzi had that classic play cleanse the kick and flash
[1:33:42] PKuall4life: or is that a window addon?
[1:33:43] GPAlexander: If I was oner, I would have flubbed my flash and fat finger kicked rakan
[1:33:47] Aoyos_: Chovy had better odds of dodging with W if he had been the ult target
[1:33:54] Aoyos_: Cuz of the buffer
[1:34:04] Aoyos_: Instead it was Peyz's body knocking him up
[1:34:22] PKuall4life: ooooh
[1:34:37] timereveal: ?
[1:34:41] jemerzmiles: you can hold space for 2x space too
[1:34:42] Aoyos_: That was LCK
[1:34:42] TorenthalStreams: Did you want t1 academy yesterday? Poby is psycho
[1:34:48] moonglaives: thats the broadcast
[1:34:50] MissingMatter: What was the hotkey for that fancy colored line in the middle?
[1:34:51] Fire_elemen6: That was a feature of the broadcast
[1:34:56] Aoyos_: Their computers flickered on broadcast
[1:35:03] Lamynator: how much value does Udyr bring at this stage of the game?  I'm getting Singed vibes, but I haven't touched the game for years either
[1:35:10] SonsOfJarvan: here we go
[1:35:20] ThatLatvianGuy: i miss bugsplat on lck casts
[1:35:20] JOEHOGE: @Lamynator hes full tank so more than singed rn
[1:35:33] jerckysminion: with this build udyr has lost most of his value
[1:35:46] Aoyos_: Udyr has to group all the time cuz he's full tank

[1:36:07] PKuall4life: *monte
[1:36:32] zen__cloud: do you think other regions will add a grub counter to their UI?
[1:36:51] PKuall4life: LEC didn't do it
[1:36:54] PKuall4life: Hopefully LCS does
[1:37:12] AzureCatalyst: I need a Grubhub Grub Counter to secure the Grubhub Dub
[1:37:19] jerckysminion: they might add it if enough people complain than again it's riot games they won't care
[1:37:27] Clyde1500: we still don't have a good way to track senna souls. I don't trust LCS to do anything.
[1:37:28] PKuall4life: @AzureCatalyst This for MSI/Worlds
[1:37:36] GPAlexander: Koreans really be spoiling us with their reaction timing because flash kicks are harder to react to than youd think since the windup stuns you.
[1:37:39] TorenthalStreams: OH NO FAKER DELETED
[1:37:49] Aoyos_: I'm not even sure if Iceborn Gaunlet is even the mythic or this game because of the threats on GENG
[1:37:55] Aoyos_: for this game*
[1:37:55] pblack: faker just proving he can repeat his worlds play
[1:38:08] GPAlexander: @Aoyos_ mythics were removed
[1:38:09] TorenthalStreams: stopwatch would've won game
[1:38:22] Aoyos_: @GPAlexander Then iceborn is def not the pick
[1:38:22] Rgb14: the ruler play
[1:38:24] ThatLatvianGuy: @PKuall4life btw you can click your profile picture in yt and click keyboard shortcuts for all of them
[1:38:27] killerwhalekj: faker sees varus, then he goes in LUL
[1:38:32] Riqui__: No Rell this game LuL
[1:38:35] Fire_elemen6: Their win condition is the Gen G PCs flicker like the broadcast
[1:38:40] SonsOfJarvan: Ruler RENT FREE in shakers mind
[1:38:48] Flukeytwitch: 5Head
[1:39:06] GPAlexander: their win condition should have been udyr split pushing with a hullbreaker imo
[1:39:11] Aoyos_: Agree
[1:39:14] Lamynator: oner didn't have the shot to followup on that ult either sadly
[1:39:23] Dzy3D: what are nilahs strengths? I never really see her
[1:39:31] Aman_CA: Finally caught one Monte stream live! Congrats on the baby

[1:39:42] Riqui__: its a good try
[1:39:53] GPAlexander: I think faker needed to try to scoop tristana instead of varus
[1:40:01] TorenthalStreams: GUMA
[1:40:08] ThatLatvianGuy: god bless for no stopwatches, or that play wins it
[1:40:14] Aoyos_: @GPAlexander Or at least having some threat on the tanks since he's never getting to the backline. Be it by Liandrys or another AP source or by something like Jaksho
[1:40:22] SonsOfJarvan: Mentalboom
[1:40:59] pblack: dude faker doesnt get mental boomed that last game most teams woulve just ff but they lasted another 20min against GENG
[1:41:00] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:41:11] fljqpy: canyon on maokai duty xdd
[1:41:34] Russkie69: as bad as it went for T1 that's about as good of a recovery they could have asked for with 1 baron left on chovy
[1:41:39] Aoyos_: The only waveclear is Azir and he can't be everywhere
[1:41:42] saberaxe: @MonteCristo The thing is that the biggest reason those hero plays worked was due to vision advantage, of which they have not abused this game
[1:41:48] SonsOfJarvan: GENG has less than 30 days playing TOGETHER, while T1 has 2 years playing together, I think ITS PRETTY OBVIOUS who HAS MORE SYNERGY, AT THE END WHO WHON THO?
[1:41:58] fljqpy: whon
[1:42:01] saberaxe: besides that lee kick
[1:42:18] PKuall4life: @SonsOfJarvan I feel like Canyon/Chovy has played with eachother before
[1:42:22] Sprintspeed: hello friends who else appreciates riot for single handedly inventing the concept of esports and being a perfectly run company
[1:42:31] fljqpy: this is not the future for canyon peepoSad
[1:42:33] kerokerogrips: where did uydr come from was it iwdGOAT
[1:42:37] SonsOfJarvan: Ikr, people doubt GOAT jungler cant play tanks XDF
[1:42:47] SonsOfJarvan: He just silence them T1 salty meatriders
[1:42:50] Aman_CA: rakan still a problem for T1 I see
[1:42:52] naocorrijo: lehends is good man, can't believe kt is going from him to beryl smh
[1:42:53] Russkie69: @SonsOfJarvan T1 griefed themselves in draft per usual
[1:43:20] Aoyos_: If teams are gonna keep picking Udyr they can't have the full tank build be the main option
[1:43:28] SonsOfJarvan: But u were so hyped KKoma came, What happened? We have FULL NEW COACHING STAFF
[1:43:32] fljqpy: canyon peepoSad
[1:43:32] PKuall4life: probably just solo q
[1:43:32] SonsOfJarvan: Its just TEAM GAP
[1:43:42] fljqpy: jg in s14 peepoSad
[1:43:43] pblack: dude canyon couldnt play tanks in 2023 just like oner played like shit in summer 2023 but then picked up his games at worlds players can improve chill @SonsOfJarvan
[1:43:48] Fire_elemen6: Canyon has become the Peanut
[1:43:49] ThatLatvianGuy: @SonsOfJarvan why do you keep yelling Kappa
[1:44:12] Russkie69: brother I am here for just good games dc who wins
[1:44:12] MrHandsomeNoodle: by interesting you mean a fucking tragedy look how they massacred my boi Sadge
[1:44:13] MansoGanzo: I hate the horizontal pick layout, vertical "OG" one was WAY better
[1:44:21] Aoyos_: This game was so silly, great watch
[1:44:23] dianstyle: No way Canyon will become antoher peanut, I  refuse to believe that. He is my jg goat
[1:44:23] SonsOfJarvan: He couldnt play tanks CAUSE DEFT IS THE WORST OVERHYPED ADC AND CANNA IS NOW TEAMLESS, while Showmaker was depressed, HE SAID THATxd
[1:44:37] fljqpy: shoemaker peepoSad
[1:44:48] Aoyos_: @MansoGanzo I hate the fact they're mirrored, it will always throw me off to see support at the far left of the screen
[1:45:01] SonsOfJarvan: Not yellin, emphasizing words haha
[1:45:21] fljqpy: D GATES
[1:45:24] Phaetox: Belveth boooo
[1:45:26] dianstyle: Can ud flex into jg
[1:45:29] TorenthalStreams: max r xdd
[1:45:30] Sabunn: the faker build this game
[1:45:32] pblack: theres only like 20ppl chatting we can see your msgs theres no need to caps everything
[1:45:33] MansoGanzo: @Aoyos_ It's just shitty design, you either get mirrored (which is confusing) or left->right for both (which is also confusing)
[1:45:35] Aoyos_: Maokai is the future
[1:45:37] fljqpy: maokai duty peepoSad
[1:45:41] SonsOfJarvan: 3 tank games and gapped GONER
[1:45:45] arthradot: lmfao
[1:45:51] MansoGanzo: CANYON ON TANK ENABLER PRISON
[1:45:51] fljqpy: canyon CHAINED peepoSad

[1:46:19] zen__cloud: canyon is still my favorite jungler
[1:46:20] SonsOfJarvan: My GOAT took a PAYCUT just to win worlds, OFC he dont mind playing TANKS haha
[1:46:21] killerwhalekj: geng draft doesn‚Äôt change even with these new change to roster lol
[1:46:24] Dzy3D: maybe they coulda pivoted udyr jg and counter top
[1:46:24] Phaetox: Canyon in chovy prison
[1:46:26] pblack: i think canyon and lehends did amazing to counter the bard this game
[1:46:35] dianstyle: GenG switch to Canyon still plays like old GenG.
[1:46:38] fljqpy: id love udyr jgl
[1:46:52] MansoGanzo: I'll get more depressed than showmaker if I keep seeing Canyon on low skill expression champions, give graves nida back ffs
[1:46:59] JoJosBizarreLife: RIP Brad
[1:47:00] Aoyos_: The position change between Keria and Guma made no sense there
[1:47:04] whitecrayonlol: Unfortunate
[1:47:05] Aoyos_: Cuz Guma was already inside that bush
[1:47:18] Fire_elemen6: Game 2 really tilted Keria
[1:47:33] fljqpy: @MansoGanzo s14 jg is ass peepoSad
[1:47:40] zen__cloud: scrim scouting for timing?
[1:47:40] FrozenGecko: chimes?
[1:47:42] SonsOfJarvan: Guys guys, like i said, GENG playing EASY comps cause lack of SYNERGY, 2nd round robin ull see canyon on CARRY junglers
[1:47:44] JoJosBizarreLife: Guma trolled him
[1:47:46] Aoyos_: Chimes don't spawn yet
[1:47:47] ibmdeepblue: jhin W
[1:47:54] MrHandsomeNoodle: @MonteCristo did geng want to get rid of delight or did he leave for his own reasons?
[1:48:05] Cipherflare: diamonds are cheap in Korea? i saw the ring üíç ad
[1:48:08] Phaetox: Bard wanting to be closer to bot before chimes spawn trigger
[1:48:11] SonsOfJarvan: Geng wanted a VETERAN
[1:48:13] SonsOfJarvan: Support
[1:48:21] Aoyos_: @Phaetox Could have started there
[1:48:28] Phaetox: Better chime placement if you do
[1:48:35] Aoyos_: Faker was already having vision at the other entrance
[1:48:44] SonsOfJarvan: And a shot caller, Delight is not a Shot caller nor veteran
[1:48:46] fljqpy: lucid debut üôè
[1:48:57] MrHandsomeNoodle: what do you mean you dont know? youre supposed to have the inside scoop for me Kappa
[1:48:58] Aoyos_: So Guma coulda been there instead of randomly swapping
[1:49:06] fljqpy: dk vs kt üôè
[1:49:07] Phaetox: The spawn rng on chimes involves ancient pathing rituals, trust
[1:49:26] Aoyos_: The real chime ritual is not moving from your T2 bottom
[1:49:32] Aoyos_: So the first set always spawns on your side
[1:49:54] Phaetox: True but that's for players without add
[1:50:03] dianstyle: Maybe Keria was grabbing bard passive
[1:50:07] naocorrijo: @fljqpy its actually dk-bro and kt-lsb
[1:50:12] Aoyos_: Worth noting Chovy had to TP to lane due to the invade
[1:50:23] pblack: these roams by lehends were amazing considering that keria picked bard to roam but geng beat them to it
[1:50:30] Aoyos_: So GENG just completely throws the game plan out the window to salvage
[1:50:43] killerwhalekj: dk kt is in this weekend if I am correct
[1:50:44] ThatLatvianGuy: hope this game is a preview of canyon/lehends synergy
[1:50:47] rhjf: this is my first look at the new map. this isweir
[1:50:50] fljqpy: nice winrate LUL
[1:50:52] rhjf: weird
[1:51:38] Aoyos_: The issue is having to TP to lane level 1 due to invade so Faker just played way more aggro
[1:51:39] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:51:43] SonsOfJarvan: Mentalboom
[1:51:43] imainleesin: ???
[1:51:44] SonsOfJarvan: xd
[1:51:54] SonsOfJarvan: Pure style of BLG vs JDG
[1:51:57] arthradot: i loved the gen g early game
[1:52:04] Aoyos_: If they don't roam heavy towards mid Faker just pokes Chovy out of lane then has a free TP back
[1:52:39] Russkie69: could he have zig zag'd tru red wall?
[1:52:40] fljqpy: tfw u cant really go from top into jg that easily
[1:52:44] SonsOfJarvan: Also belveth with bot push coulve invaded CANYON in his botcamps
[1:52:46] fljqpy: stupid huge wall
[1:52:52] Russkie69: ah okay
[1:52:56] SonsOfJarvan: But decided to go towards his top camps
[1:53:00] SonsOfJarvan: jg diff
[1:53:05] killerwhalekj: yep
[1:53:16] Aoyos_: It's the only build vs Udyr
[1:53:20] PKuall4life: Rekkles...
[1:53:32] Phaetox: He goes bork wits kraken or something
[1:53:33] Aoyos_: If you go AP the Udyr shield with Kaenic Rookern means you always lose
[1:53:52] PapaSmithy: u just will get tower dived if u dont do it u literally cant enter lane
[1:53:59] JoJosBizarreLife: "Hey guys, I saw the support for our amateur team playing this.  It's good, I swear!" - Zeus
[1:54:06] PapaSmithy: since u can go mr sunfire and then 1 million mr shield
[1:54:07] fljqpy: going AP into udyr LUL
[1:54:09] PapaSmithy: items r crazy gud
[1:54:18] beautifulminds: This game becomes a fiesta
[1:54:28] HollowBilly: PapaSmithy <3
[1:54:31] JoJosBizarreLife: Sup Papa
[1:54:32] GPAlexander: built full tank teamfighting with udyr and then AD split push with kennen. what a life.
[1:54:44] SonsOfJarvan: PapaSmithyyyyyyyy I always get nostalgic when I remember old times u and LS casting LCK
[1:54:50] SonsOfJarvan: Beautiful memories
[1:54:52] PapaSmithy: <#
[1:54:54] PapaSmithy: *<3
[1:54:58] fljqpy: <#
[1:54:59] Aoyos_: AD Kennen just has way too much sustained damage for the Udyr shield to deal with all of it
[1:55:23] JOEHOGE: <#
[1:55:26] brandofan2: keria is doing some gaming
[1:55:27] MrHandsomeNoodle: <#
[1:55:45] fljqpy: canyon left kellin for this
[1:55:45] Flukeytwitch: we <
[1:55:46] ThatLatvianGuy: @PapaSmithy gl running EU's 5th seed <#
[1:55:49] Fire_elemen6: Keria kinda sprints it this game
[1:55:55] JoJosBizarreLife: @fljqpy Damn right he did
[1:56:22] MrHandsomeNoodle: leaving kellin was a pro not a con LUL
[1:56:30] beautifulminds: LUL
[1:56:42] fljqpy: imagine geng losing this game Kappa

[1:56:46] naocorrijo: coached by mata
[1:56:48] Riqui__: ive never seen that wall being Bard portalled before
[1:57:04] SonsOfJarvan: Brother Lehends doing his job
[1:57:12] Aoyos_: @Riqui__ Idk if that spot changed but you used to be able to portal from around there to inhib tower
[1:57:15] kerokerogrips: monte what did you think about the team owner message from the lck  and then T1's response to it
[1:57:39] Sabunn: bard q was too good
[1:57:43] Rgb14: bard portal was cool
[1:57:45] Riqui__: @Riqui__ oh damn
[1:57:45] brandofan2: crazy to give lehends rakan 2 games in a row
[1:57:46] fljqpy: not double adc meta LUL
[1:57:49] JoJosBizarreLife: Lehends should've jumped onto Oner there, yeah.  Probably thought they could get both still.
[1:58:00] ThatLatvianGuy: @kerokerogrips prob partially what made joe marsh delete his twitter
[1:58:15] Aoyos_: @Riqui__ I believe it was inbetween T2 and T1 where you could portal to inhib
[1:58:18] SonsOfJarvan: Also Canyon showing he can COUNTER his own Playstyle of carry jungler
[1:58:42] fljqpy: full grubhub special tho
[1:58:58] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips LOL WHAT he did that?
[1:59:01] Riqui__: @Riqui__ ye theres a small gap in the wall at the inhib turret. but seems like that wall should be straight for the rest of the lane
[2:00:03] Aoyos_: There's the gold lead monte
[2:00:05] Aoyos_: Just a casual 2k
[2:00:36] esr_140: Susge
[2:00:37] fljqpy: he got trucked
[2:00:37] brandofan2: the whole twitter is crazy
[2:00:38] sillycoomer69: 3 players changed and t1 still cant beat them huh
[2:00:52] kerokerogrips: easy for t1 to disagree when they are in the unique position of having faker as part of the brand
[2:00:54] noyea96: Dont worry the PC Player of the year 2023 will carry that game
[2:01:03] boringbr1ck: Huh? What happened?
[2:01:06] Giiino: wait what happened with this
[2:01:10] JoJosBizarreLife: Look Monte.  It's about having convictions and sticking to them.
[2:01:13] fljqpy: hacked LUL
[2:01:14] dianstyle: @sillycoomer69 that 3 players are upgrades
[2:01:14] JoJosBizarreLife: Or the opposite of that...
[2:01:27] cryyylovee: cuz it looks really good for them
[2:01:33] ThatLatvianGuy: joe marsh: sry my little brother got my pc
[2:01:36] fljqpy: peanut > canyon
[2:01:42] Fire_elemen6: Maybe his tweets were, in fact, not his own
[2:01:42] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:01:44] fljqpy: delight > lehends
[2:01:48] JoJosBizarreLife: Joe "Flim-Flam" Marsh
[2:01:50] MrHandsomeNoodle: yeah i hacked him and the others so they cant say anything about it
[2:01:51] watersidegnat: *me when I say something stupid* damn hacked again
[2:01:57] Aoyos_: Joe Marsh just pulled a Doublelift but actually had the awareness to realize it afterwards
[2:01:59] fljqpy: kiin = doran
[2:02:04] SonsOfJarvan: xd
[2:02:24] SonsOfJarvan: Hle will mis worlds, again
[2:02:30] Riqui__: lehends flash for dominance
[2:02:30] kerokerogrips: what happened two years ago ?
[2:02:36] pentalem: I'm ootl. What he do?
[2:02:40] Bladetykon: @MonteCristo why no ping in discord that is what it is fore now I missed the first two hours
[2:03:14] fljqpy: twitch got noti too
[2:03:23] ThatLatvianGuy: Poor Caedrel was so sad when GEN were hard fisting T1 at the beginning
[2:03:44] jimbo002y: losing peanut means GENG took a hit in macro for sure
[2:03:52] Aoyos_: @Bladetykon LCK teams did a collective message saying LCK teams need better financial avenues and Joe Marsh basically tweeted "Don't count us in that message"
[2:03:54] jwangggg: People can selectively mute notifications they don't want to see on discord so it's much less intrusive to do live notifications IMO
[2:03:58] wesc3: this is bad draft for t1
[2:04:14] fljqpy: lose = bad draft wcyd
[2:04:23] brandofan2: just dont see the upside of belveth
[2:04:35] fljqpy: win = world champion 4x goat
[2:04:50] beautifulminds: Huge value
[2:04:55] whitecrayonlol: Then rotate to dragon nice
[2:05:02] SonsOfJarvan: Arnold now owns GENG and T1
[2:05:04] SonsOfJarvan: Niceeeeee
[2:05:04] l0st3560: the geng curse remains for t1 üò≠
[2:05:30] killerwhalekj: surely this game is easy 20 minutes game LUL
[2:05:41] fljqpy: gg Kappaa
[2:05:41] aGDnc: joe marsh probably had to delete his twitter to resign oner
[2:05:45] breyus_: hey monte just wanna say i really enjoy your content and what you stand for in the space. Keep up the great work man!
[2:05:50] jimbo002y: GENG has some trouble closing out games, youll see later
[2:05:56] AzureCatalyst: Like Gen.G's macro is incredibly good considering they lost Peanut who was considered their primary shotcaller. It might be like the CSGO honeymoon phase where you keep alot of the old shotcallers systems in place even with a new IGL
[2:06:01] beautifulminds: Clean 25 min game inc Kappa
[2:06:11] Aoyos_: Lethality
[2:06:13] commando1814: yone should be called roger ailes cause he's clearly fair and balanced
[2:06:20] Riqui__: spellshield good vs Bard
[2:06:25] AzureCatalyst: I think Gen.G's test is going to be in 6 months if they still look this clean and practiced
[2:06:29] JoJosBizarreLife: I know Dom is taking a step back, but I hope we get Season 2 of "The Hater"
[2:06:31] brandofan2: was tired on getting flash ulted by faker
[2:06:34] Riqui__: hail of blades is standard for lethality
[2:06:45] Russkie69: after that lee kick last game he got the ptsd build

[2:06:52] Aoyos_: He can probably dodge all Jhin ult shots that way
[2:06:54] l0st3560: I think hail is for laning
[2:07:02] LuxtheGod: on hit is lethal tempo or bust
[2:07:02] SonsOfJarvan: Bro, GENG just beat "world champs" with 3/5 NEW PLAYERS, it doesnt get better for T1
[2:07:05] SonsOfJarvan: xd
[2:07:09] fljqpy: udyr having to buy armor peepoSad
[2:07:14] fljqpy: stupid ad kennen
[2:07:16] LuxtheGod: throwing away like 2 attack speed with varus passive
[2:07:22] Dzy3D: peyz thought he was on jhin
[2:07:25] ThatLatvianGuy: @JoJosBizarreLife T1 losing and sparks of canyon masterclass, he won't resist
[2:07:25] trueaether: do the games mostly seem like a player diff?
[2:07:45] beautifulminds: Swifties reduce the slow during charging q
[2:07:46] wesc3: is kennen even a threat for a flank ult
[2:07:47] Aoyos_: @trueaether Draft and builds aren't the best either
[2:07:51] fljqpy: aiming vs deft sooon
[2:08:02] Riqui__: Travis Kappa
[2:08:05] trueaether: @Aoyos_ from both sides?
[2:08:07] AzureCatalyst: Ghost is the commisioner Pog
[2:08:15] commando1814: do you go Nikes on varus always then with the q reduction ?
[2:08:16] KnowP4in: markz in a hat :)
[2:08:22] Fire_elemen6: Actually Ghost Pog
[2:08:25] Aoyos_: @trueaether To varying degrees
[2:08:49] beautifulminds: The Fiesta begins
[2:08:54] pianoluver: faker what was that WutFace
[2:08:58] fljqpy: how can geng lose this
[2:09:01] Fire_elemen6: Guma's Jhin kinda stinks
[2:09:03] Aoyos_: Now this is when the game begins
[2:09:18] noyea96: esports player of the year ult
[2:09:23] trueaether: I think Jhin kinda just sucks
[2:09:34] jimbo002y: jhin is only good when ahead
[2:09:35] SonsOfJarvan: This is where the Lack of Synergy of GENG and T1 synergy starts to play a huge role, then it is just a team gap
[2:09:39] Esterifikace: the game is such a fiest from now vicksyLUL
[2:09:40] fljqpy: its just 0/5 botlane its not jhin's fault
[2:09:52] Aoyos_: Oner always dashes away the moment he sees anyone
[2:09:57] Aoyos_: That's why CC misses
[2:10:08] AzureCatalyst: Oner just said no and left lmfao
[2:10:11] trueaether: Jhin is one of few adcs that cannot do anything unless he is definitively ahead
[2:10:18] Rgb14: i think faker had to do it cause the maokai ult was coming to fast
[2:10:21] brandofan2: idk how much different the game is even if he gets the timing there
[2:10:37] fljqpy: how can this go to lcs drake
[2:10:52] quackerquack123: surely t1 does not get this drake
[2:11:00] commando1814: hey monte the falcons have interviewed bulk check and harbaugh - how Should I want ?

[2:12:08] Fire_elemen6: MEEP SLAP
[2:12:16] Aoyos_: Keria uses Q and Oner smites midflight pretty sure
[2:12:21] fljqpy: just flip it
[2:12:23] Aoyos_: Looked like Q not meep
[2:12:28] AzureCatalyst: meepslap is hilarious
[2:12:29] AzureCatalyst: I love bard
[2:12:35] sillycoomer69: at this point i just wonder gen vs other lck teams monkaHmm
[2:12:57] Aoyos_: Meep damage is in two different instances so it sucks for burst
[2:13:01] trueaether: @sillycoomer69 they will probably just hands gap most other teams, probably will make them worse long term
[2:13:01] jimbo002y: inb4 geng gets destroyed by HLE LUL
[2:13:06] Kung_Julio: why are so many eastern tops playing udyr now?
[2:13:14] fljqpy: after the complaint from the other 9 teams of lck, imagine they go to 8 teams LUL
[2:13:24] Aoyos_: @Kung_Julio Unstoppable early on
[2:13:33] Flukeytwitch: @Kung_Julio they're going for D gates
[2:13:34] Aoyos_: The builds blow for transition though
[2:13:40] Kung_Julio: @Aoyos_ i mean like what changed between this and previous patch
[2:13:52] Sabunn: tank items
[2:13:53] Aoyos_: Was rework Udyr even available
[2:13:54] Sabunn: are broken
[2:14:04] AzureCatalyst: I think mythics weren't really good for udyr and alot of the new itemization makes him extremely durable
[2:14:21] AzureCatalyst: Tank items are busted and udyr takes advatange of them but prepatch udyr was pretty much a demonic into tank rusher anyways
[2:14:25] fljqpy: ksante is still way better
[2:14:25] Aoyos_: But tank items are way too good with the new season changes
[2:14:27] Riqui__: @Aoyos_ removal of sunderer helps a lot
[2:14:33] trueaether: Do any interesting rosters play today?
[2:14:43] Aoyos_: The fact there's no mythic restriction also allows for versatility
[2:14:49] AzureCatalyst: That was so many knockups jesus
[2:14:52] jimbo002y: @trueaether DK vs their father BRO GIGACHAD
[2:15:22] trueaether: oh its a Lucid first game angle
[2:15:31] Sabunn: who tf is FearX
[2:15:32] fljqpy: lucid debut üôè
[2:15:37] jimbo002y: @Sabunn LSB
[2:15:42] Aoyos_: @Kung_Julio If you want anti tank damage you can freely pick Liandrys now, not locked to a mythic core
[2:15:51] AzureCatalyst: Du du du du du du Do the baron (tothe beat of Van McCoy's - The Hustle) Du du du du do the baron
[2:15:52] Esterifikace: but if we do it now it cannot get stolen
[2:16:05] Sabunn: @Sabunn another bad lck rebrand
[2:16:13] Aoyos_: @jimbo002y Former sandbox
[2:16:16] maletroll: based
[2:16:17] MrHandsomeNoodle: they dont wanna baron cuz they know itll get stolen Kappa
[2:16:25] Giiino: how many liar liar references can one stream have
[2:16:27] AzureCatalyst: The Lighthouse?

[2:17:12] cryyylovee: lowti3Suprised
[2:17:14] skinlessx: he was really good as count Olaf in a series of unfortunate events
[2:17:20] commando1814: who is some of your fav comedian / actors
[2:17:21] AzureCatalyst: How about the Mask?
[2:17:22] Imaslapyou: Best Willem Dafoe performance?
[2:17:22] Combusttion: the mask
[2:17:27] mgtman228: old jim carry was way better than anything even remotely new
[2:17:32] HollowBilly: @skinlessx he was excellent as count olaf
[2:17:44] TorenthalStreams: Based
[2:17:45] MrHandsomeNoodle: slapstick type humor has to be really creative to be funny to me but his usually arent
[2:17:46] ThatLatvianGuy: cable guy enjoyers FeelsGoodMan
[2:17:53] ZeroTheGame: I don't get dumb and dumber. It's just not funny to me
[2:18:01] Clyde1500: I completely forgot there was a niel patrick harris version. and that jim carrey was count olaf originally.
[2:18:02] kidolli1: Neil was so good as olaf dang
[2:18:06] TorenthalStreams: I work for neil patrick harris as a gardener
[2:18:09] AzureCatalyst: How does T1 stall this game out? It looks so over
[2:18:14] GenericAnimeName: i was promised a fiesta
[2:18:16] commando1814: I was more Adam Sandler >>> Jim and will farrel
[2:18:22] Aoyos_: @AzureCatalyst With a lot of help from GENG
[2:18:25] HollowBilly: Jim Carey at Medieval Times in Cable Guy is all time great film scene fight me
[2:18:38] TorenthalStreams: he's nice 10/10
[2:18:38] skinlessx: indeed @hollowbilly rooStare
[2:18:40] Fire_elemen6: Now look at how much time is left in the broadcast despite Gen G having Hex soul
[2:18:42] AzureCatalyst: I heard he was a dick (Didn't he have a cheese and meat platter made in the shape of Amy WInehouses corpse?
[2:18:49] JoJosBizarreLife: Been a fan of that dude since Starship Troopers
[2:18:51] trueaether: Do we have hope that geng will become cleaner, or are they doomed to perma stall games like every year?
[2:18:55] AzureCatalyst: Or is that celebrity gossip that I am spreading
[2:18:59] Riqui__: monte doesnt know
[2:19:02] arthradot: PepeLaugh they will
[2:19:03] fljqpy: geng midgame madness LUL
[2:19:07] jimbo002y: @AzureCatalyst GENG acquired 2023 KT's curse of not being able to close games properly
[2:19:08] zoramura: @MonteCristo Off topic, but I remember u mentioned training in Muay Thai, what made u pick that martial art over other forms?
[2:19:10] Sabunn: geng do a spectacular job of trolling this game
[2:19:18] commando1814: @riqui__ monte ( Scotty ) doesn't know
[2:19:21] fistigons25: Gen G late game macro kinda whack this game
[2:19:31] Sabunn: lehends
[2:19:33] hitmon_gg: LUL
[2:19:35] AzureCatalyst: LMFAO
[2:19:38] Riqui__: LuL
[2:19:43] Rgb14: loll
[2:19:44] cris_jg24: t1 things
[2:19:48] jimbo002y: lehends
[2:19:52] whitecrayonlol: Oner refuse to lose
[2:19:58] Rgb14: this is why they didnt want to do baron kekw
[2:20:07] Fire_elemen6: Oner is just him
[2:20:07] fljqpy: lulhands send him over
[2:20:17] fljqpy: yep
[2:20:18] jimbo002y: YEP
[2:20:20] Sabunn: lmao
[2:20:24] hitmon_gg: zeplaQstare
[2:20:36] Aoyos_: He was above the blastcone when he decides to auto
[2:20:41] outlandishwow: bel veth would just hit it anyways
[2:20:42] Aoyos_: But Oner is pathing down so he ends up below the plant
[2:20:46] whitecrayonlol: Either way he has dash tho
[2:20:47] tmihee: NOHANDS ICANT
[2:20:49] MrHandsomeNoodle: he had flash anyways though
[2:20:49] sillycoomer69: wtf LUL
[2:20:56] gloriousducksu: If Lehends doesn't hit it Oner would've just done it anyway
[2:21:02] wesc3: varus
[2:21:03] trueaether: maybe he felt threatened by belveth?
[2:21:07] pblack: varus using q on bel hit baron?
[2:21:12] Fire_elemen6: It came from the particle vomit
[2:21:14] Aoyos_: Varus E hits Baron too
[2:21:18] ThatLatvianGuy: old jim carrey movies are a good shout for foreplay
[2:21:27] fedw4: boner
[2:21:31] fljqpy: just blast cone the enemy jg in and make it 50/50
[2:21:43] outlandishwow: @fljqpy oner would just hit it
[2:21:59] Aoyos_: Lehends just took forever to commit to attacking the cone
[2:21:59] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:22:01] jwangggg: saw it at 79
[2:22:01] AzureCatalyst: He couldn't get into pit because he doesn't have form. So he can't go over walls with dashes @MonteCristo
[2:22:11] fljqpy: it should have been over already
[2:22:33] memoriant: Honestly game3 T1 seem so outdrafted
[2:22:49] Aoyos_: Lehends had to hit the cone the moment he's in range cuz Oner is not on it
[2:22:50] jimbo002y: t1 draft is absolute trash when behind
[2:22:51] fljqpy: just blastcome him in LUL
[2:22:52] geo2044: @memoriant it's the weibo finals draft kekw
[2:22:55] Aoyos_: Dunno why was he thinking about it so much
[2:23:03] fedw4: as a t1 fan, we've relied on stupid shit happening for the past few years excluding worlds 2023
[2:23:06] MrHandsomeNoodle: @MonteCristo he has flash though so getting in was never ganna be an issue
[2:23:10] ton1erdmann: Hylissang positioning
[2:23:15] Lamynator: wish they panned to the faces of different players at that moment, surely one of them would've had a great reaction
[2:23:15] trueaether: @MonteCristo what teams in LCK are you actually excited to watch if any?
[2:23:19] Faramonde: he did have blastcone and t1 has no displacement.. He could still get in
[2:23:31] AzureCatalyst: I'm excited for HLE
[2:23:40] AzureCatalyst: I pray to god HLE is not a trash fire for Viper's sake
[2:23:40] Aoyos_: FearX hype, what a name
[2:23:42] hitmon_gg: KT Aware
[2:23:44] ThatLatvianGuy: saved oner a flash for this play
[2:23:47] memoriant: Zeka in Akali meta give me that
[2:23:55] pblack: game 3 draft i feel like they went bard jhin so keria can roam and jhin stays solo in lane against the varus and rakan but geng turned it on its head by having rakan roam with moakai
[2:23:55] Riqui__: HUH
[2:23:55] Kaniskion: HUH
[2:23:57] jwangggg: clearly dudu's fans must be called dudu heads
[2:23:57] paddlestar_gallactica: can‚Äôt get enuf dudu
[2:24:00] Rgb14: dudu
[2:24:09] fljqpy: didnt they lose to noodle brand
[2:24:13] basedbasedbasedbased: When does BRO play?
[2:24:17] trueaether: is KDF's botlane solid? I remember Bulldog looking promising at least last year
[2:24:19] Dim_Mon: He found them.
[2:24:20] Aoyos_: Lehends won this game so he will be the one to throw it
[2:24:22] jimbo002y: @basedbasedbasedbased today vs DK
[2:24:25] Fire_elemen6: He didn't expect the lich bane burst Kappa
[2:24:32] basedbasedbasedbased: @jimbo002y based
[2:24:39] Rgb14: whose ur underdog team this year?
[2:24:50] AzureCatalyst: Cryptbloom does so much healing
[2:24:56] fljqpy: crypto PogChamp
[2:24:58] AzureCatalyst: If you have a bunch of melee skirmishers it's actually insane
[2:25:10] PaddiV: nice holy nova ^^
[2:25:13] AzureCatalyst: Cryptbloom with a xin or a jax top is actually disgusting
[2:25:20] AzureCatalyst: If you are playing ap mid
[2:25:26] ReapersArk: Its just sad items no longer show dmg/healing done on 90% of items so we can compare better between choices
[2:25:27] jimbo002y: if only their jungler is something useful instead freaking belveth
[2:25:36] fljqpy: ahh the full 6 grubhub special
[2:26:00] Aoyos_: Cryptbloom giving ability haste makes it way more versatile than Void Staff
[2:26:12] AzureCatalyst: The ability haste is nice but the little pop of healing
[2:26:23] AzureCatalyst: Really makes your skirmishers that much deadlier in teamfights and dives
[2:26:26] Aoyos_: It does
[2:26:30] Len_xyz: what's funny with narratives is I saw a comment after this game 3 that "its sad that Chovy still can't lane against Faker". LUL
[2:26:30] paddlestar_gallactica: this is my bard gameplay
[2:26:30] Russkie69: the first blood bard also helped yone to get going too
[2:26:35] Rgb14: keria is having a tough game. he keeps over extending solo
[2:26:46] Len_xyz: while he roamed most of the early game
[2:26:47] smollpuddle: DILF GAmer B)
[2:26:55] AzureCatalyst: Wait did t1 get all the grubbs
[2:26:57] Aoyos_: But the Ability Haste means way more champions are willing to pick it compared to Void Staff
[2:27:37] quackerquack123: still better than doss

[2:27:55] Fire_elemen6: Keria unlearned Bard during the offseason
[2:28:01] Dim_Mon: What is this game xD
[2:28:15] fljqpy: his bard is mid
[2:28:16] Dim_Mon: This feels more like summer 2013 then last season for sure this game haha
[2:28:17] Riqui__: surely
[2:28:23] AzureCatalyst: Surely Jhin doesnt' steal baron
[2:29:09] GenericAnimeName: in this game keria looks like he got inspired by doss
[2:29:16] Riqui__: its really good here
[2:29:29] Aoyos_: Axiom is super good
[2:29:31] Len_xyz: I love that we finally have split push back, and void grubs helping with it. Makes it fun when its vs a teamfight comp imo
[2:29:33] trueaether: The udyr build is really good, but somehow he still melts
[2:29:43] Aoyos_: He will always melt in this game
[2:29:44] AzureCatalyst: Axiom arc might just be for more picks Since he's going lethality. I doubt he really wants and extendied fight and havintg a free 30 seconds on chains seems insane after a pick
[2:29:48] Rgb14: he probably has like 90 cdr
[2:30:14] Aoyos_: Another Anathema chains woulda been better than thornmail
[2:30:23] Fire_elemen6: Jhin does negative damage to him
[2:30:30] AzureCatalyst: Holy
[2:30:31] Dzy3D: warmogs undervalued
[2:30:33] trueaether: Do we think LCK will play Hwei?
[2:30:33] AzureCatalyst: Where idd oner's hp go
[2:30:37] AzureCatalyst: No
[2:30:37] fljqpy: surely this is gg Kappa
[2:30:54] ton1erdmann: Chovy literally didn't do anything lol
[2:31:02] GPAlexander: belveth and azir both trigger on hit effects so the thornmail will apply to them too
[2:31:02] Len_xyz: that Bard stun was great
[2:31:05] Aoyos_: I still say that Bard Q stun was bs
[2:31:10] jimbo002y: @ton1erdmann yone got stunned
[2:31:17] fljqpy: that bard q is stupid
[2:31:18] Aoyos_: It was out of range but landed because Yone's E ended so he got dragged back into range
[2:31:20] ton1erdmann: yes and then  he died and didn't do anything
[2:31:44] wesc3: bard q
[2:31:51] Riqui__: bard q into jhin w
[2:31:54] fljqpy: that is NOT lined up
[2:31:57] Aoyos_: He got hit by Bard Q mid E flight
[2:31:57] pblack: chovy dashed into the bard q
[2:31:59] fljqpy: riot fix ur game
[2:32:11] Aoyos_: It's super bs
[2:32:17] fedw4: above average at holding games ye
[2:32:31] trueaether: the amount of people just fiending to hate chovy is wild
[2:32:40] Dr_Roti: insane that they just won a fight  against elder and baron
[2:32:40] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:32:51] Hi_ImPhantomere: Can T1 ever beat Gen.G?
[2:32:53] Aoyos_: Bard Q landed on a minion, the second hit was gonna touch nothing but Yone E dragged him back on the path so the Bard Q latches onto him
[2:33:05] fljqpy: its 4v5 in base
[2:33:09] trueaether: @Hi_ImPhantomere didn't they win at Msi last year?
[2:33:14] Aoyos_: His tether was on a different spot though
[2:33:19] Aoyos_: That was midflight
[2:33:26] Hi_ImPhantomere: that was forever ago
[2:33:38] Hi_ImPhantomere: they havent won a bof since then
[2:33:44] fljqpy: yea theres no way that bard Q should hit, yone is unstoppable during snapback
[2:33:47] Dzy3D: this rakan build
[2:33:48] Dim_Mon: Well you said ever
[2:33:49] Mirukubun: Iceborn Chovy
[2:33:53] kookoolau: No Monte and DoA as casters  T1 cannot play against GEN G Kappa
[2:34:01] Aoyos_: Yeah if the game worked properly that Bard Q doesn't stun Yone and game ends
[2:34:27] trueaether: this new pure MR item is a little broken I think
[2:34:34] Aoyos_: It's stupid strong
[2:34:36] fljqpy: 6 grubs LUL
[2:34:36] MissingMatter: @Aoyos_ "if the game worked properly" is a low percentage play
[2:34:39] ton1erdmann: lmao
[2:34:42] Aoyos_: @MissingMatter Right?
[2:34:50] fedw4: it's so frustrating playing against champs built like that
[2:34:50] cryyylovee: zoooomies lowti3Dance2
[2:35:02] jimbo002y: T1 kinda acquired 2022 DRX powers for some reason
[2:35:03] paddlestar_gallactica: splitpush azir and team fight Kennan lmao
[2:35:09] Aoyos_: The stun on Yone was as hailmary as it gets
[2:35:10] fljqpy: peyz going insano
[2:35:16] cryyylovee: could you explain whats happenin im in game
[2:35:18] Fire_elemen6: Faker really thought "what did that bad Zed do in Season 3 again?"
[2:35:26] kookoolau: the biggest factors are the champion picks
[2:35:33] Aman_CA: We still going ???? I just came back from a shower. LOL this game was LOONNNGG i guess
[2:35:44] Aoyos_: @Aman_CA Almost there
[2:35:46] GPAlexander: GenG just seems to have T1 dialed in now more often than not. I bet Canyon walked into the gen g facility and there was just a book left behind for him labled "how to fuck with oner"
[2:35:52] kookoolau: jg and ads are too far behind in early game...
[2:35:54] Dzy3D: monkaW second elder
[2:36:03] Cipherflare: we still here?! this game
[2:36:15] Riqui__: such a smart bard ult
[2:36:17] Aoyos_: Clearing mid
[2:36:22] Aoyos_: Belveth wants that money
[2:36:25] fljqpy: where the belveth indeed
[2:36:28] kookoolau: and GenG knows T1 plays behavior
[2:36:29] Vyoz: that bard ult was nutty
[2:36:36] Aman_CA: 96 monkaS
[2:36:38] fedw4: lich bane does not proc from soldiers
[2:36:59] naocorrijo: idk why canyon didnt flash, i think they thought varus wq would do the job
[2:37:01] pblack: oner had to be there for the steal
[2:37:09] jimbo002y: plays like this is why you can never count this T1 out ever
[2:37:12] Riqui__: oner could never get in the pit there
[2:37:16] kookoolau: steal is not that easy
[2:37:19] Aoyos_: @naocorrijo W too
[2:37:27] Aoyos_: Either one gets you out of bard ult
[2:37:32] Rgb14: did bard miss q????
[2:37:34] naocorrijo: true
[2:37:35] Rgb14: ???
[2:38:04] Vyoz: @rgb14 too far i think

[2:38:09] Aoyos_: @Rgb14 The only way it hits if it maokai gets hit then latches onto dragon
[2:38:10] pblack: but that elder buff kill on faker stopped all momentum to hold o n
[2:38:22] fedw4: gg
[2:38:38] GPAlexander: I think they lose even with elder
[2:38:38] Aoyos_: But maokai was in stasis
[2:38:40] pblack: this was a fun series all in all for the first of the season
[2:38:41] Dim_Mon: So fun
[2:38:48] zPostModern: tbf, this game shouldve been over 15 minutes agi
[2:38:57] hitmon_gg: GenG comin in hot
[2:39:02] Aoyos_: Udyr all games
[2:39:10] AzureCatalyst: does void staff actually mean t difference in stealing that elder or no?
[2:39:12] fljqpy: canyon winning peepoSad
[2:39:22] Aoyos_: @AzureCatalyst Probably actually
[2:39:24] cryyylovee: its peyz lehands vs guma keria?
[2:39:24] jimbo002y: we can credit Lehends for that crisp early macro imo
[2:39:25] hitmon_gg: canyon with kiin and lehends is great

[2:39:41] pblack: im interested to see how the teams play out after the meta is established
[2:39:45] GPAlexander: All of Gen G's players are veterens if a hundred battles against T1 at this point. Even if synergy wasn't immediate, the experience helps a lot
[2:39:49] Nem3an: are you and thorin going to be doing competitive edge this season @MonteCristo ?
[2:39:51] Len_xyz: I liked a point by casters, when Lehends get allowed to go out of lane, he performs extremely well to help his jungler.
[2:39:54] Aman_CA: Kiin for 2024 race
[2:39:57] roland_desc: roland_desc subscribed with Prime. 
[2:39:58] Aoyos_: +10 AP and +10% magic pen on void probably means Faker gets elder
[2:39:59] Riqui__: I think flashing that game 2 kick is hard to be critical on. if it was "easy" even for pros Oner wouldnt go for that play
[2:40:00] Dr_Roti: do you know why a lot of the korean pro's have that bowl cut
[2:40:14] leggo3: @MonteCristo I'm thinking of going to Hatchet Hall from your rec. Anything other than cornbread I should get?
[2:40:21] fljqpy: its national haircut
[2:40:33] Aoyos_: @Riqui__ It wasn't about it being easy, Oner needed a hero play else they lose

[2:42:45] Dabrens12: Baseball season ticket for a medium team cost the same price than a ticket for an LA NBA game
[2:42:55] Fire_elemen6: is it not that they want to dissolve LCK and make their own league with blackjack and hookers?
