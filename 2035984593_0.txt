[7:43:50] cloudydaisies: blanketJam
[7:43:52] acpop: @Thommenius ok i'll
[7:44:12] Drayssen: @acpop 100% you can rank up with any support, I will say though that playing certain enchanters rely on your ADC performing very well in order to augment them late-game
[7:44:33] Drayssen: If you want to have more impact in the early game, a lot of engage supports are much better for climbing
[7:44:35] The_Alfies: Jhin is the Ori from last game

[7:46:27] denunciator: :o
[7:46:40] jamessaysdance: this champ is so uninspiring
[7:46:46] Drayssen: What do you think would be the HARDEST off-meta support to climb with? (Almost like a challenge)
[7:46:50] rugaru12: busted champion nunu
[7:46:59] jamessaysdance: cant wait for people to just let hwei rot into obscurity
[7:47:00] kwsskw: cupic would have won if he didnt play champ q server
[7:47:02] denunciator: is Yuumi an offmeta support LUL
[7:47:04] xCaeIum: Okay but, Deft playing Q-max poke Kallista is also cooking.

[7:49:32] denunciator: that ignite stopped warwick from 1v9ing there
[7:49:57] rebornshim: Theres no chance i can learn this champ, i cant even learn aphillo adc
[7:50:14] jamessaysdance: @rebornshim aphelios is harder
[7:50:34] jalex54202: HYPERS
[7:50:43] JrWeise: hwei was my support dream. it‚Äôs either him or seraphine for me
[7:50:47] rebornshim: @jamessaysdance yee? I never looked at his kit i cant even understand
[7:50:52] Thommenius: Hwei in a nutshell then kek
[7:50:59] kwsskw: aphelios has this opportunity/luck factor
[7:51:06] kwsskw: u need to know combos
[7:51:11] Lazynameross: catArrive
[7:51:16] JrWeise: hwei = q is attack, w is support, e is fear
[7:51:19] AnnaHighwind: Hwei's kit feels really satisfying and natural to work with once you've played him a few games, imo
[7:51:23] denunciator: aphelios requires that your team play around your gun strength/weaknesses
[7:51:39] denunciator: even in pro they mess it up and try to fight dragon with absolute disaster weapons
[7:51:45] xCaeIum: Beryl in comms at one point commented that he pressed a combo and it was the wrong one üòπ
[7:51:50] Yuckaholic: what warwick skin is that? i like the mark
[7:51:51] kwsskw: i dont think u kill
[7:51:53] JrWeise: @annahighwind yess this! at first he‚Äôs overwhelming but once you have some time with him he‚Äôs a lot easier to understand
[7:51:57] gardenoir94: ono
[7:52:00] denunciator: ono
[7:52:02] kwsskw: vlad hard counter ur ult

[7:55:13] Thommenius: They won both
[7:55:14] denunciator: they won both games
[7:55:15] Lazynameross: renata was terrible
[7:55:17] AnnaHighwind: They won both games
[7:55:18] xCaeIum: Uh no Beryl was popping off
[7:55:18] denunciator: renata KEKW
[7:55:20] kwsskw: oh
[7:55:22] 1Asunachi: he played it twice
[7:55:31] rebornshim: Ohhh
[7:55:44] xCaeIum: Wait watch the bot play game 2‚Ä¶ like 8 mins or so
[7:55:47] rebornshim: He was KSing not feeding
[7:55:47] AnnaHighwind: Horizon Focus is high value on Hwei as well
[7:55:51] Drayssen: anyone telling you beryl was trolling is 100% lying
[7:55:59] denunciator: NOOOO
[7:56:01] denunciator: NOT THE PYOSIK STEAL
[7:56:05] denunciator: my soul
[7:56:20] denunciator: also clear not pressing R that whole fight
[7:56:27] AnnaHighwind: QE for damage slow
[7:56:29] shiro_schwi: I FORGOT THE LCK IS ON
[7:56:32] xCaeIum: Ye watch the game 2 early game bot 2v2
[7:56:33] denunciator: it's not on it's over
[7:57:17] denunciator: there are usually highlights at the end of each game so you can watch those
[7:57:20] rebornshim: Stunt is in toronto right?
[7:57:40] demonminer3: the fissure? i think it's 20%
[7:57:44] kodoberry: EW is just easier to hit and more consistent imo
[7:57:48] Lazynameross: control mage time
[7:57:48] ThomasTheTwink: fissure is 30%
[7:57:56] som963: som963 watched 10 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[7:57:59] Drayssen: Is this just the new and improved glacial meta?
[7:58:04] demonminer3: my mistake, it probably is 30
[7:58:07] Drayssen: don't need glacial with you have fissure
[7:58:17] xCaeIum: Not this
[7:58:20] xCaeIum: Keep going
[7:58:26] AnnaHighwind: The QE just really helps to keep distance between you and the enemy while making your ccs more consistent
[7:58:33] Lazynameross: the early renata ult play xdd
[7:58:38] Lazynameross: kali*
[7:58:57] denunciator: i guess it's like karma q and you just have to live with it
[7:58:59] demonminer3: @AnnaHighwind yeah, you can QE, into an E spell usually, and then straight into R no matter which one you hit
[7:59:05] xCaeIum: Little further I think
[7:59:09] denunciator: soon
[7:59:20] Lazynameross: 7:15
[7:59:27] AnnaHighwind: @demonminer3 Yeah, pretty much, the burn on it is also pretty nice
[7:59:38] demonminer3: use WE for more damage and mana, of course, or save it for WW, or even use WQ before combos to close the gap
[7:59:43] xCaeIum: BDD my bae
[7:59:49] denunciator: LUL
[7:59:55] xCaeIum: Here we go

[8:00:17] denunciator: hena flopped that one
[8:00:17] xCaeIum: THE UNO REVERSE
[8:00:32] Drayssen: that's an FF already
[8:00:34] denunciator: deft is so good at adc i can't
[8:00:37] demonminer3: @AnnaHighwind its not so much the burn i like, not to say it's bad, but whats really nice is that its a massive AOE proc of passive. passive damage on hwei adds up fast, especially with a combo that has QE and R included.
[8:00:41] Drayssen: mental has to be pretty shattered after that
[8:00:45] Drayssen: even at the pro level
[8:01:03] xCaeIum: beryl surviving into Double kill is crazzzzzyyy
[8:01:17] cloudydaisies: Vibe
[8:01:23] denunciator: oh i see pyke mid with hydra is back
[8:01:25] Drayssen: If you were in that botlane after that, what encouraging words would you tell your ADC?
[8:01:25] denunciator: T1 played yesterday
[8:01:28] xCaeIum: T1 next game tomm
[8:01:40] denunciator: T1-Gen Aware
[8:01:40] AnnaHighwind: @demonminer3 When you're against a tankier team, the burn really stacks, I find personally - though I do mostly use it to keep space between me and the enemy with the slow and guaranteeing my E spells
[8:01:48] rebornshim: I thought LS was gonna cast LCK games but hes not live on twitch
[8:01:57] denunciator: given how many 7k leads have been thrown in LCK it's always winnable
[8:02:09] TwitchTime89: winnable. :)
[8:02:22] Drayssen: Do the in-game comms sound relatively similar to when you have champions queue games and everyone was in VC?
[8:02:28] denunciator: tbh baron does so much damage and the pit has so many angles that just a poorly set up baron will throw
[8:02:48] denunciator: not the vayne fp...
[8:02:54] xCaeIum: But ye Deft went q max kallista too to combine with hwei poke‚Ä¶ it was spicy
[8:02:56] denunciator: i think it's time to pull out a stunt special
[8:03:17] rebornshim: Support karma
[8:03:25] demonminer3: @AnnaHighwind yeah, i think that's what most hweis do. you shouldnt discount QQ for poke of course, that move does a lot of damage
