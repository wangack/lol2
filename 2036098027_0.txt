[1:46:58] juan_aguilar_g: How it works w ezreal?
[1:47:18] afp_warden: Cyclosword over Youmuu/Oportunity I mean
[1:47:29] rejnes4: did you start with sup item on senna?
[1:47:33] afp_warden: slow is only on melee
[1:47:39] xcalebur: https://gyazo.com/cae995612559bbf6380fc8c9700004bc

[1:49:37] Frescote: xayah?
[1:49:37] xcalebur: yasuo angle
[1:49:42] afp_warden: how's lethality Kalista?
[1:49:45] beavertje: voltaic kalista?
[1:49:51] kajo100032: would double supp item work with caitly lux in solo q since the lux would go ap and the gold would help her a lot
[1:49:54] Baummam: isnt every game a draven angle ?
[1:50:00] thebuzzzkilla: YES
[1:50:35] shaavola: Or mantheon?
[1:50:37] xcalebur: its pantheon supp man
[1:50:42] xcalebur: its not that rare in low elo
[1:50:53] xcalebur: jax
[1:50:54] Baummam: yeah jax
[1:50:58] thebuzzzkilla: 0% crit draven with sundered sky? Pog

[1:51:33] oneshotreceiver: green is emerald
[1:51:38] juxqq: I know it too.
[1:51:55] thebuzzzkilla: hubris gives you infinate ad and sundered sky garanteed crit
[1:52:07] shaavola: What do u think of armor and mr shards being removed and replaced with flat hp scaling hp and tenacity?
[1:52:17] 666tmp: reasoning behind sorc 2nd?
[1:52:23] dirkrush: @Jackspektra dude it's actually broken

[1:53:36] thebuzzzkilla: NO its broken i swear
[1:53:39] Baummam: but what about the champs that have like 18 base armour or  mr , they just die vs flat pen
[1:54:22] Baummam: but there are more champs then adcs, lot of mages have 20 or lower armour
[1:54:27] 666tmp: carried by nash gg
[1:54:55] xcalebur: nash tried his best
[1:55:02] xcalebur: you... i think you could do more
[1:55:05] shaavola: Makes flat pen just way more busted it already is no?
[1:55:08] 666tmp: non adcs usually face one champ in lane too, it's not like supp deals magic adc deals physical lot of the time
[1:55:09] xcalebur: kappachungus
[1:55:11] Baummam: yeah in the adc context i see that. but i was talking about the change overall. Sorry for misunderstanding
