[0:04:59] ATG_Sandvich: I hope youtube isn't doing slowing streams down too
[0:05:04] WickedGamerWolf: I always gotta go to adv settings in the yt streams to change the resolution
[0:05:06] Isquen: YouTube doing the advertising evils again
[0:05:09] simplyinvincible: @riflemad yeah youtube is sabotaging their own website to get rid of adblockers
[0:05:11] TDesius: Trio and a Duo?
[0:05:25] SturmGeist08: SturmGeist08 subscribed with Prime.

[0:06:04] darkkrusty: eh grasp would of been good but that one you have gives a little sustain so it works too
[0:06:04] hotswitchexe: early game is going to be rough I'd imagine
[0:06:05] KinderOrphan: I just found out a couple days ago that it was the adblocker that was messing with my youtube. I thought it woudn't affect me because I have Youtube Premium, but nope.
[0:06:15] Isquen: But yeah you're gonna be permanently invaded have fun with it

[0:07:21] demon_ent: augHi chat and kaif
[0:07:26] simplyinvincible: @hotswitchexe facts
[0:07:38] SinfulJokes: Where teemo?
[0:07:40] simplyinvincible: hi @demon_ent
[0:07:44] SinfulJokes: Hiyaa chat
[0:07:46] tyr_vidar: Not fair to compare it to Teemo NOPERS
[0:07:49] simplyinvincible: @sinfuljokes glen is teemo
[0:07:55] SinfulJokes: Oh i see
[0:08:05] hotswitchexe: the clear is surprisingly healthy
[0:08:11] TinyMagnus: Does Senna jungle actually work?
[0:08:16] hotswitchexe: quite slow though
[0:08:22] demon_ent: is kaif 5 stacking?
[0:08:28] IIlSoralIl: top teemo, perfect for glen
[0:08:31] simplyinvincible: @tinymagnus we’re about to see
[0:08:31] jayys__: @TinyMagnus nope :/
[0:08:50] zenoskyler: @iilsoralil Because teemo is fighting olaf.
[0:08:53] M1ni_h: @hotswitchexe maybe with hard leash it would work better
[0:08:57] simplyinvincible: has Kaif discovered the forbidden technique. senna jungle.
[0:09:18] hotswitchexe: @M1ni_h and not getting invaded at level 1 by the whole enemy team LUL that might also help
[0:09:25] IIlSoralIl: @zenoskyler nah i mean teemo gives toxicity just like glen
[0:09:36] M1ni_h: yeah it could LUL
[0:10:12] simplyinvincible: I played wukong top back when I played, the main reason was because funny monke and my friends told me to play top so im out of the way lol
[0:10:13] hotswitchexe: that Galio engaged at the worst possible time
[0:11:21] hotswitchexe: Senna is just ranged Nasus
[0:11:46] darr0w2: It's refreshing seeing someone play in low elo
[0:12:00] M1ni_h: what are you building first?
[0:12:08] IIlSoralIl: !who
[0:12:08] Nightbot: Kaif is playing League of Legend with Ben, Ebbz, PidgePlum and Stan.
[0:12:08] simplyinvincible: @darr0w2 its always high elo streams I wanna see someone play with the boys
[0:12:19] hotswitchexe: might as well change her name to Susan kaifW
[0:12:20] simplyinvincible: someone at my level lol
[0:12:49] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible real
[0:13:15] simplyinvincible: it is real though
[0:13:22] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible how long have u been playing league for?
[0:13:23] simplyinvincible: high elo is too bigbrain for me
[0:13:23] tyr_vidar: Like getting hit by a morg q
[0:13:24] hotswitchexe: you're not having mana issues tho
[0:13:36] simplyinvincible: @darr0w2 on and off, probs played like 100 games total max
[0:13:36] rivlwolf: hia kiffy good mornin
[0:13:47] simplyinvincible: or even less
[0:14:02] derbrtige: sooo kaif you gonna grab the ai monitor with advanced warning tech?
[0:14:07] simplyinvincible: i havent played in like 8 months i believe
[0:14:10] ItsMwindo: i feel like grilling today, maybe some burgers, hotdogs and ribs
[0:14:11] hotswitchexe: Duskblade was also removed
[0:14:19] SazarJr: senna is evil and tanky and does dmg basically a happy meal in lol form
[0:14:33] simplyinvincible: @sazarjr does she come with a toy
[0:14:34] Isquen: And Duskblade, Stan, did you forget literally everyone building it
[0:14:35] MorganTao: I am glad Duskblade was removed
[0:14:39] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible ah, that's ok, 100 games is very little. i've been playing on and off since 2016 and only last season i hit diamond, this game has a very steep learning curve
[0:14:57] simplyinvincible: @darr0w2 yeah im at the point where I play funny monke because funny monke
[0:15:02] simplyinvincible: i have no knowledge of anythin
[0:15:03] ItsMwindo: not entirely your fault Stan, Galeo is damn unit
[0:15:14] derbrtige: its so stupid to ask if its cheating xD cause a monitor analysing the game and warning the player is a little op
[0:15:32] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible that's how it is in the beginning, as long as you're having fun it's all good.
[0:15:33] simplyinvincible: @derbrtige maybe id get to silver with that LOL
[0:15:38] hotswitchexe: Galio's whole gimmick is being antimage, he should win lane against a mage
[0:15:46] SazarJr: @simplyinvincible yes one that hurts LUL
[0:16:03] derbrtige: @simplyinvincible fair fair, maybe i would try playing against players with that as well xD
[0:16:06] simplyinvincible: @darr0w2 theres a reason I havent played in 8 months, its fun until I realize oh damn im behind and gonna lose the rest of the game
[0:16:12] Isquen: Waitwaitwait
[0:16:21] Isquen: Voidgrubs drop Senna souls?!
[0:16:27] simplyinvincible: all I enjoy is engaging whenever possible.
[0:16:46] simplyinvincible: i’ve had cool moments but they dont really cause me to win unfortunately
[0:16:55] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible now that feels like the mindset of every player in my elo. But tbh some games are lost in draft pick and just unwinnable.
[0:17:04] simplyinvincible: @sazarjr giant gun in a little happy meal
[0:17:20] derbrtige: i feel like a toddler i usuallly play with a friend and he tells me what skill i need to use when xD i'm just not made for competitive games like that xD
[0:17:29] simplyinvincible: @darr0w2 I think im geniunely like iron/bronze
[0:17:35] simplyinvincible: with the brain of a copper
[0:17:41] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible i have the same problem and my teammates don't follow me so we end up losing xd
[0:17:47] SazarJr: @simplyinvincible LUL LUL LUL
[0:18:22] hotswitchexe: fun fact: if Olaf is close enough to kill you
[0:18:23] derbrtige: uhh standing up table
[0:18:28] ItsMwindo: LUL
[0:18:28] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible nah, you just gotta learn when to engage and when not to.
[0:18:29] hotswitchexe: he is close enough to kill you
[0:18:52] rivlwolf: ngl kaif i thought that was a starbucks pillow kaifW
[0:18:55] simplyinvincible: @darr0w2 probably yeah, I have like 0 multi tasking ability too I can’t pay attention to multiple things at once
[0:19:01] simplyinvincible: so thats not that great
[0:19:02] ashleyncat: ayeee stream time
[0:19:12] simplyinvincible: i played a decent blitzcrank though which was fun
[0:19:16] simplyinvincible: blitzcrank/monke
[0:19:27] hotswitchexe: Kaif has 75% kill participation
[0:19:27] ItsMwindo: they might be scared to mess with you too much in jungle LUL
[0:19:31] derbrtige: @rivlwolf is it not? xD
[0:19:55] hotswitchexe: what the dawgs doin
[0:20:21] darr0w2: @simplyinvincible as long as you're having fun with the game is good, it's better than ending up like me playing ranked for "fun"
[0:20:24] simplyinvincible: @zumzar97 The cycle might continue for me too, I might reinstall league
[0:20:29] TDesius: This is a very one sided game LUL
[0:20:40] simplyinvincible: @darr0w2 yeah I might reinstall and continue the cycle
[0:20:44] SazarJr: I have pizza and fries and the salt for the fries are provided by this game VoHiYo
[0:20:56] ItsMwindo: that galio damage, jesus christ
[0:20:57] simplyinvincible: i play on na servers as eu cause all my friends play on na. so that doesnt rlly hell
[0:20:59] simplyinvincible: help

[0:22:56] darr0w2: @derbrtige FeelsBadMan
[0:23:46] simplyinvincible: congratulations @sr_kaif
[0:23:59] TDesius: Kaif, here's an idea LUL let a randomiser pick your Jungler each game LUL
[0:24:08] simplyinvincible: @tdesius that’d be hilarious
[0:24:13] simplyinvincible: i recommend trying out monke
[0:24:18] MorganTao: minión
[0:24:22] hotswitchexe: @TDesius ultimate bravery moment
[0:24:36] TDesius: No no, not ultimate bravery cause that's broken LUL cause new items etc
[0:24:41] TDesius: But just a Randomiser to select the character
[0:24:42] hotswitchexe: f
[0:24:51] derbrtige: @TDesius i thouight kaif is already doing it but with just random picks xD
[0:25:06] TDesius: He's going in with a rough "Plan" then forgetting it LUL

[0:25:33] derbrtige: heya
[0:25:33] TDesius: @UNM_Valeleaf You alive?
[0:25:41] hotswitchexe: would there be only jungle champs in the randomizer or could you have something like Kog'Max jungle kaifW
[0:25:51] MorganTao: A friendly butler has entered the ring
[0:25:53] demon_ent: is that a wild butler
[0:25:53] TDesius: Yes
[0:25:55] simplyinvincible: yes please
[0:25:59] IIlSoralIl: 20/10 still winnable
[0:26:03] ItsMwindo: has anyone seen that "pokemon with guns" game? Looks interesting
[0:26:03] yaoifan1: Jungle yummi
[0:26:08] Lyraii: @MorganTao butler is never friendly smh
[0:26:08] derbrtige: hmm yuumi jungle
[0:26:10] hotswitchexe: but think of the content Kaif kaifContent
[0:26:30] SazarJr: jungle lux
[0:26:34] SazarJr: ez
[0:26:41] simplyinvincible: @iilsoralil realistically, yes but chances arent huge. However if ur ranking up you always go for it cause even if u win 1/10 thats free elo
[0:26:49] TDesius: @SR_Kaif I sent you a link LUL
[0:26:49] hotswitchexe: for some reason I want to see Kaif play Syndra
[0:26:56] MorganTao: Jungle yuumi, ez
[0:27:02] Daffen_Prime: omg so many cuties in here, Butler, Desius, Sazar
[0:27:05] derbrtige: @TDesius i se you are prepared :D
[0:27:11] Lyraii: sazar is the ice age baby
[0:27:12] simplyinvincible: @tdesius do you think we could convince kaif to play the monke
[0:27:14] Isquen: Hullbreaker doesn't give stupid free stats anymore
[0:27:23] TDesius: @simplyinvincible Nah let the random just happen
[0:27:26] Daffen_Prime: Lyraii too
[0:27:28] simplyinvincible: xD
[0:27:34] simplyinvincible: sure
[0:27:35] Isquen: Downside being it can be used WITH a team now
[0:28:01] SazarJr: @lyraii and you are a lyraii! ha got emmmm
[0:28:10] Lyraii: oh damn he got me
[0:28:21] hotswitchexe: lyraii is apparently a noun now
[0:28:23] SazarJr: Kappa Kappa
[0:28:25] simplyinvincible: whats up @lyraii
[0:28:27] Lyraii: I'm sendin desius the ice age baby video
[0:28:30] Lyraii: whatup
[0:28:38] TDesius: Sus
[0:28:44] toekanplayz: Extra farm Pog
[0:28:48] SazarJr: you come up with the most cursed things
[0:28:54] derbrtige: quick question, the icons on the left instead over the minimap is that an ingame setting?
[0:29:09] simplyinvincible: i believe so @derbrtige
[0:29:17] simplyinvincible: just changing the HUD
[0:29:24] Lyraii: @SazarJr it's not cursed if it's true
[0:29:29] Nightbot: Follow Kaif on Twitter and Instagram to see more pointless shit, and Doggo pics. https://www.twitter.com/kaiffyt https://www.instagram.com/iamkaiffu/
[0:29:31] Lyraii: ...scratch that yeah its cursed
[0:29:33] derbrtige: ahh okay it seems so much more convenient
[0:29:54] SazarJr: @lyraii seee for once I am right LUL
[0:30:08] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[0:30:08] Lyraii: but its also funny!
[0:30:14] TDesius: Stormsurge needs to be removed or nerfed
[0:30:16] JustaStoopidDog: overtuned
[0:30:17] TDesius: LUL
[0:30:18] jaffybara: I like how I joined to you getting the surge LUL
[0:30:18] JustaStoopidDog: for sure
[0:30:36] jaffybara: @TDesius Hard nerf is the answer
[0:30:37] SazarJr: random question what type of characters can use stormsurge
[0:30:49] jaffybara: AP characters
[0:30:49] SazarJr: asking for a friend
[0:30:54] YYDazie: Hello
[0:30:58] SazarJr: give me an example
[0:31:02] SazarJr: 👀
[0:31:03] jaffybara: Fizz

[0:31:18] IIlSoralIl: they baroning
[0:31:20] jaffybara: Rumble is nasty as fck with it

[0:31:32] TDesius: Stormsurge Cho'gath is fun though LUL
[0:31:41] simplyinvincible: @hotswitchexe is wukong good rn
[0:31:44] hotswitchexe: he wins lane and scales into a lategame monster
[0:31:44] Lyraii: I don't think desius agreed with the ice age baby video LUL
[0:32:06] Ninosai: Mmmh I have some tasty white chocolate pudding as a snack
[0:32:07] jaffybara: @TDesius Alright going to test this tonight LUL

[0:32:35] TDesius: LUL
[0:32:36] TDesius: Do it
[0:32:50] hotswitchexe: @simplyinvincible he has an average winrate of 49,7% in Plat+, but he has a slightly positive winrate top
[0:32:55] SazarJr: @tdesius chocho can use it?? back to maining bean VoHiYo

[1:30:03] TDesius: "In Korea"
[1:30:05] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[1:30:05] TDesius: LUL

[1:32:47] Mjay182: XD
[1:32:49] TDesius: The benefit of being a Cynical brit
[1:33:03] Vikingmech: Is the bug for infinite shield still in the game with the new items?

[1:33:33] SazarJr: @TDesius hater

[1:35:49] naltcai: kaifHeart
[1:35:50] Zizzles__: have u tried driving the rift herald yet?
[1:35:52] Laetoy: Hello Kaif and chat
[1:36:03] Vikingmech: @Solaris2118 they do in toplane
[1:36:24] Solaris2118: @Vikingmech didnt notice that, hence the question mark
[1:36:27] hotswitchexe: @TDesius prepare to watch him feed for 15 games in a row LUL
[1:36:42] jakaupr: BrainSlug

[1:37:36] Vikingmech: @Solaris2118 Happends Nw :)
[1:37:47] IIlSoralIl: that would have been a sick moment
[1:37:55] Mjay182: idk i just got told
[1:38:00] IIlSoralIl: get a kill, steal the dragon and escape
[1:38:16] Mjay182: that my bud was getting one shot by a lich bane stormsurge zak
[1:38:17] DuskEdgeX: I think it's just cause Zac has good AP scaling?
[1:38:29] ItsMwindo: His ratios might be really good
[1:38:30] GlobaL_xZeRo: !lurk
[1:38:30] Nightbot: Thank you GlobaL_xZeRo for going into the Salt Mines and get all the salt needed for the SR team to tilt Rob. Make sure to watch out for the salt-ins kaifSalty
[1:38:35] balsamico69: Shadowflame is insane on zac
[1:38:41] balsamico69: But its on everyone so
[1:38:55] ItsMwindo: jesus that damage
[1:39:00] Zizzles__: zacs ratios are good but zac i dont think can weave in enough autos for lichbane to be good
[1:39:34] KaitoKhaine: Lich Bane is basically an empowered Auto Attack after using an ability. Should work for one shots but not much value in extended fights
[1:39:36] balsamico69: The only auto you do is with q and i dont think lichbane procs then
[1:39:41] ItsMwindo: I'm guessing people brute force his ratios into making auto attacks insane
[1:40:06] Mjay182: zaks second part of his q is an auto
[1:40:13] hotswitchexe: since when does Seraphine do damage?
[1:40:15] Mjay182: and w is spamable
[1:40:20] Mjay182: so autos chunk
[1:40:20] SazarJr: no kill only pain
[1:40:28] dinga15: what is kaif made off
[1:40:32] dinga15: of*
[1:40:36] balsamico69: Yes but with league as its is it might not proc it
[1:40:56] Zizzles__: ^
[1:41:23] Zizzles__: i dont think zac q aa does proc any onhits
[1:42:00] Mjay182: dont get me wrong it sounds int af
[1:42:04] Vikingmech: It should, should it not? its an empowered basic right?
[1:42:14] Mjay182: it is a right click
[1:42:15] balsamico69: You know what, i test it quick
[1:42:16] IIlSoralIl: mid diff again
[1:42:19] balsamico69: Brb
[1:42:21] Zizzles__: yeah but with how riot code this stuff it might not
[1:42:47] Mjay182: @Zizzles__ spaghetti code being spagheitt code
[1:42:50] MightyW0x: Should have smited i think
[1:42:53] Zizzles__: exactly
[1:43:30] SinfulJokes: It was kayn who disappeared. ben kept lifestealing
[1:43:38] Vikingmech: Has kaif ever yelled JOOO! back at ebbs when she yells Nej?
[1:43:41] Zizzles__: morde ulted kaif with a spell shield on him
[1:43:51] IIlSoralIl: did ben get boogie woogie
[1:43:51] Zizzles__: so it doesnt take u to death realm
[1:43:54] ShadowWordBozo: Nout stood on him i think
[1:43:57] YYDazie: maybe ben got covered by other champs
[1:44:16] CaptainBritog: yes kayn ulted jax and you just thought jax disapeard because i saw jax
[1:44:19] Zukumay: Apparently Gragas and Veigar are getting damage buffs next patch, thoughts?
[1:44:29] Vikingmech: Gragas fr?
[1:44:50] SR_Tricko: he didnt disapear he just jumped ontop of kayn and they stacked perfectly so you could only see kayn and his healthbar
[1:44:50] Zukumay: Yup
[1:44:51] Vikingmech: he already busted in low to mid elo. In my opinion
[1:45:09] Zizzles__: gragas is a noob stomper champ
[1:45:13] SR_Tricko: i went back
[1:45:14] Vikingmech: Vikingmech subscribed with Prime. 
[1:45:14] Zukumay: Because they are needing stormsurge they are buffing him...
[1:45:24] TDesius: Tricko is right
[1:45:25] TDesius: LUL
[1:45:26] Zukumay: Nerfing*
[1:45:29] CaptainBritog: I saw Jax there is nothing else I can tell you
[1:45:30] balsamico69: ok i tested it and lichbane zac is weird. your aa with q doesnt proc it, buuuuuut if you dont press anything you insta aa and proc lichbanes
[1:45:44] balsamico69: after q stunned
[1:46:01] SR_Tricko: https://clips.twitch.tv/ExcitedTentativeAlligatorBlargNaut-yieoD5UWTLaer2jK

[1:46:09] hotswitchexe: do we do Liandry's next?
[1:46:09] balsamico69: ye
[1:46:16] Vikingmech: cool did not know that
[1:46:26] balsamico69: as if you would use titanic right after aa
[1:46:55] Zizzles__: they actually removed most cdr on items so now its more slow
[1:46:56] YYDazie: i see ben jumped so his hp bar  got covered by another hp bar
[1:48:24] Zizzles__: he lives
[1:48:50] TDesius: The biggest flaw to Zac and why I hate him at times LUL is cause his leap doesn't have unstoppable
[1:49:04] SeiyaTheWolf: kaif why must you play this horrible game
[1:49:09] Mjay182: ^ that sir would be broken
[1:49:11] TDesius: Yeah no it happened, he grabbed you
[1:49:15] Kinju0_0: i just noticed kaif still has a pot
[1:49:21] balsamico69: i mean, its one of the strongest engages
[1:49:23] Caitemo: tbf it would be insane if zac had an unstoppable jump
[1:49:29] betterjunglealwayswins: @TDesius if he had unstoppable in that it would just be straight up broken, no counterplay
[1:49:36] SazarJr: great game, I might be shit at it but I do love it
[1:49:40] stooophi: Wait we can redeem for totem still kaifW
[1:49:44] ItsMwindo: Same Sazar
[1:49:57] Zizzles__: a zhonyas might be needed later
[1:50:11] TDesius: @betterjunglealwayswins Just look at other characters who can't be stopped xD , the blob needs something in life. I am also Biased towards Zac
[1:50:18] SazarJr: @ItsMwindo Eyyy at least one more thinks like me
[1:50:25] MAD_B0X: Heya lads! I see SR's suffering in ranked?
[1:50:41] betterjunglealwayswins: @betterjunglealwayswins adc would just have to play from fountain probably :p
[1:50:44] balsamico69: @TDesius they cant be stopped bc its the ult with 1 min cd
[1:50:46] ItsMwindo: I mostly just play super casual, aram and stuff with friends
[1:50:58] balsamico69: but zac hast it every 8s
[1:51:00] TDesius: @betterjunglealwayswins ADC's play from fountain anyway xD
[1:51:18] TDesius: I mean I dunno why y'all are arguing with this, I even said I was biased towards Zac
[1:51:35] betterjunglealwayswins: @betterjunglealwayswins  peepoSad
[1:52:01] colin12222222: R u going pro?

[2:09:56] Daffen_Prime: 2 eps out kaif
[2:09:57] TDesius: I ruined it LUL
[2:09:58] lord_grims: the solo leveling anime is out
[2:10:06] lord_grims: but it hasnt started the real story yet
[2:10:07] datfishyboii: hello there
[2:10:13] TDesius: I watched 2 episodes of it and then read 200 chapters of manga LUL
[2:10:16] MAD_B0X: @lord_grims It will tomorrow tho.
[2:10:39] stooophi: Oh how is its anime quality?
[2:10:48] lord_grims: @TDesius have you read the lightnovel?
[2:10:48] IIlSoralIl: actually is called manhwa kaifHarold kaifHindsight
[2:10:53] datfishyboii: hold up, nino is nino again? downgrade...
[2:11:04] MAD_B0X: @stooophi Fucking DOPE.
[2:11:05] datfishyboii: kaifW
[2:11:18] TDesius: @lord_grims I think the manga just showed the light novel or such not gonna LUL I've seen the start, ending and the extra pages LUL
[2:11:30] JustaStoopidDog: yeah he can
[2:11:43] stooophi: @mad_b0x Aite guess it's time to watch then kaifW
[2:11:45] lord_grims: i read both
[2:11:47] hotswitchexe: So Gragas is pretty good
[2:11:47] Planistorun: gragussy
[2:11:55] lord_grims: i like the novel a bit more then the manga
[2:12:05] MAD_B0X: @stooophi Do it. ASAP. You will not be dissapointed. Next episode will release tomorrow (afaik)
[2:12:05] TDesius: Kaif shoved his Gragussy all over them LUL
[2:12:11] datfishyboii: @Planistorun kaifGurn
[2:12:23] SinfulJokes: The anime is taking content from the novel while taking the art from the manhwa
[2:12:40] DreamerBock: @SR_Kaif So how u enjoying the new season
[2:12:44] lord_grims: i havent been impressed by the anime
[2:12:57] TDesius: I watched the 2 episodes, got curious and did my usual
[2:13:01] TDesius: and binged the manga
[2:13:07] TDesius: this is why I run out of anime to watch
[2:13:08] TDesius: LUL
[2:13:09] Valid_JarJar: it came out on the 6th
[2:13:11] MAD_B0X: @lord_grims I have. Especially the music - but that's a given considering Hiroyuki Sawano (AoT composer) is making it.
[2:13:18] datfishyboii: i feel the anime is fine tho
[2:13:23] MAD_B0X: making it's ost*
[2:13:26] datfishyboii: same desius KEKW
[2:13:41] lord_grims: i could just be expecting to much from teh anime
[2:13:45] lord_grims: cause i have read both
[2:13:53] stooophi: Yeah same
[2:13:55] TDesius: Considering there's 200 chapters, either they're gonna cut half the shit from the anime, or we're in for a long ride of waiting LUL
[2:14:01] MAD_B0X: I've also read both, so I guess we just have different expectations, grim.
[2:14:05] datfishyboii: wait does kaif have new glasses or something
[2:14:29] stooophi: That does remind me I should read the after version
[2:14:39] stooophi: Been like a month since I have read it
[2:14:57] MAD_B0X: Anyway chat, I'll be back in like 20 minutes. Imma make myself some chicken nuggets or smth.
[2:14:58] TDesius: I think I read all 200 chapters in one day though LUL literally just non stop reading
[2:15:09] lord_grims: @TDesius i honestly dont know
[2:15:18] lord_grims: first ep has alot of fluff
[2:15:22] datfishyboii: desius did you read the beginning after the end? no anime yet sadly but i like the story alot
[2:15:45] TDesius: Nope, I generally wander into random manga's or anime all the time LUL
[2:15:54] stooophi: Yeah the feeling when you find a good manga and has a lot of chapters is just kaifW
[2:16:01] datfishyboii: then that might be one for your list
[2:16:06] Planistorun: kaif are you enjoying the game?
[2:16:38] lord_grims: have you read virtual combat mage?
[2:16:42] lord_grims: it was pretty good

[2:20:10] lord_grims: vitural combat mage
[2:20:18] datfishyboii: its not that nino will leave us, nino will leave "us".
[2:20:36] TDesius: Virtual World: Close Combat Mage ?
[2:20:39] hotswitchexe: @Ninosai you mean the Swain thing? what was so bad about it? legit question

[2:20:56] TDesius: Honestly
[2:21:03] hotswitchexe: @Ninosai Oh that LUL
[2:21:04] TDesius: My current favourite is The Wrong Way To Use Healing Magic
[2:21:11] Planistorun: okayyyyy
[2:21:12] Ninosai: close combat mage is a boring manga
[2:21:24] Daffen_Prime: @TDesius i like that one

[2:41:16] Ninosai: Desius can you stop upsetting the streamer? KEKW

[2:42:30] TheBlazing: who is the lux?
[2:42:42] MozzieZh: i havent look at league in forever, what were those things in the pit?
[2:42:43] TDesius: Darius : Q Healing Buff LUL , Garen's shield lasts 4 seconds so it's a early game buff, his E is getting more AD Ratio (So his spin hits harder) And Amusingly, Ezreal is getting a Damage buff to his Q, W and R LUL
[2:42:51] Lindos123: where is their jungler?
[2:43:13] datfishyboii: ezreal buff? lmao

[2:44:09] datfishyboii: KEKW
[2:44:10] Zizzles__: i enjoy ezreal but like these buffs are a bit much even with the item changes no?
[2:44:37] TDesius: I mean we don't know how significant the buffs can be. They just say Damage increase for now. Nothing about the Values.
[2:44:45] Zizzles__: ah ok
[2:44:47] datfishyboii: is it me or is nothing happening in this round
[2:45:01] TDesius: If it's just tweaking to account for loss of certain items, that's fine
[2:45:03] Zizzles__: nope cos shiv is a farming jungler
[2:45:10] Zizzles__: doesnt want to fight early
[2:45:27] Zizzles__: @TDesius true true
[2:45:32] Ninosai: He's been playing League so often over the years you're just outing yourself by doing that @mads12300

[2:46:35] Grimaroth: @TDesius Playing league and liking league are two VERY different things tho :D
[2:46:46] datfishyboii: "let him cum"
[2:46:52] datfishyboii: kaifBlush
[2:46:57] mads12300: @ninosai ok good for you i just like to Watch from time to time dont have to be a die hard fan like you

[2:47:32] datfishyboii: truest of truths
[2:47:36] TDesius: I mean Kaif, Stan is getting kills. It's all good LUL
[2:47:41] Ninosai: @mads12300 Then don't judge his playing a game as you drop in the stream
[2:47:43] Kinju0_0: kaifW
[2:47:53] Lindos123: Is Stan getting the kills really a good thing? ^^
[2:48:05] Wellarth: @Ninosai Can we do a poll for each game, if they win or not?
[2:48:06] Ninosai: watch, here comes the 'just a joke' defense

[2:48:42] datfishyboii: this one has to be a big choke to lose
[2:48:56] MozzieZh: in their defence all they did was say "you good" lol. i wouldnt say thats judging anyone
[2:48:57] Lindos123: @datfishyboii You were saying?
[2:49:19] MozzieZh: they have 4 messages total and none are them being critical of how kaif plays LUL
[2:49:33] datfishyboii: @Lindos123 ehhhhhh
[2:50:32] Ninosai: @MozzieZh who gives a flying fuck, to begin with. I hate LoL myself, I don't drop in the chat and diss on Kaif playing it
[2:50:35] TheBlazing: i hope to see some ap shyv pop off

[4:23:12] Witch_Shaelyn: kaifW
[4:23:15] datfishyboii: oh no
[4:23:16] hotswitchexe: Rob LUL
[4:23:26] SR_BigBoaby: honestly i have no idea on league
[4:23:33] SR_BigBoaby: just seems tough as shit like
[4:23:35] hotswitchexe: @SR_BigBoaby bronze is the second lowest rank in League
[4:23:38] Witch_Shaelyn: Yeah bronze is a hard level. Hard to get out of kaifW
[4:23:39] Tahiahin: I only know Dota
[4:23:44] Tahiahin: no idea about League
[4:23:45] Pirendello: its like raid finder level in wow raids
[4:23:47] datfishyboii: bronze is like almost bottom gutter mate
[4:23:55] PinkNiaPolitan: @SR_BigBoaby its complicated x__x
[4:23:58] SR_BigBoaby: yeh but is it when a new season comes out
[4:24:04] SR_BigBoaby: like people grinding to get out
[4:24:18] SR_BigBoaby: so loads of good teams then all fighting to go up a rank?
[4:24:29] datfishyboii: nono not like that
[4:24:31] hotswitchexe: League isn't a very beginner friendly game due to how much the game changes constantly
[4:24:37] datfishyboii: thatd be chaos
[4:24:50] datfishyboii: @hotswitchexe that is true
[4:24:56] Witch_Shaelyn: @SR_BigBoaby Not everyone starts off in bronze. You do some games before you're actually get ranked to get your placement and people can start anywhere from Bronze to I wanna say Plat outta provisionals
[4:25:03] SR_BigBoaby: yeh but surly if ure good at league, new season, you start say now then there team could face a hard team in this bracket?
[4:25:06] Tahiahin: beginner friendly would be Heroes if they didn't kill it
[4:25:34] bloodlustfantasy7: Dang missed 4 hours of league
[4:25:53] SR_BigBoaby: mall my keyboards would be gone doing this
[4:25:57] SR_BigBoaby: all*
[4:25:59] hotswitchexe: @SR_BigBoaby the normal version of League has solo players entering a queue and playing as 1 member of a team of 5, and they're all randos

[7:13:42] Nightbot: Look, chat. Kaif likes to discover and find out about a game on his own and get to experience the novelty of discovering new things in games that he hasn't played before. To that objective, we ASK that you do NOT give information or tell Kaif what to do or how to do something in the games, unless he asks chat directly for help. If you believe there is something that Kaif would not find out unless told about it, you can write it in chat, just don't be a cunt about it and don't spam.

[7:37:56] TDesius: Everyone in that game was roughly 1-2k Apart from the Aposite person to their laner. Top lane had a 7k Gold difference. Voli went hard
[7:38:03] Snoopy1118: Malz with Maligma, locking them down into the burn, is so good.
[7:38:26] datfishyboii: no worries mate
[7:38:31] Valla0: yee the volibear was a plat player

[7:39:58] pup_polydon: is the enamie all AD?
[7:40:00] datfishyboii: its only missing a fizz
[7:40:00] TDesius: Not sure if that guy did it on purpose but LUL Former Plat (Last Season) Voli, never did a single game of Flex in his life. So the system of "Ranked" put him as an Iron/Bronze player LUL
[7:40:06] TDesius: Matchmaking at its finest
[7:40:10] Snoopy1118: Lilia will be good, though, for all the max HP burns.
[7:40:24] paynefolly: Build armor and you win
[7:40:30] jinlatwo: is ben gold
[7:40:43] TDesius: What's with all this Yasuo hate?

[7:45:47] datfishyboii: seems like another playable horror using microphone
[7:46:15] Snoopy1118: Sion supp with Yasuo is a very weird choice.
[7:46:24] TDesius: Did Matchmaking just put you against bots? LUL
[7:47:07] slage123: even bots are better than this
[7:47:21] TDesius: Imagine if doom bots were players
[7:47:30] Pirendello: I think kaif's discord has a recommendations channel datfishyboii

[7:53:47] Snoopy1118: I realize why Sion supp with Yas now.
[7:54:06] TDesius: Huh..
[7:54:14] TDesius: I just looked up the enemy team LUL
[7:54:26] Valla0: tbf they have a lot of scaling on their team with yas, sion, nasus
[7:54:46] TDesius: Iron 1 x 3, Former Iron/Bronze and a Unranked level 24 Account Garen LUL
[7:54:56] datfishyboii: yikes

[7:55:43] TDesius: LUL
[7:55:54] Snoopy1118: A worthy sacrifice to get Stan gold.
[7:55:58] Valla0: @Pacifistlock it'll be doing him a mercy KEKW
[7:56:02] TDesius: I had a little chuckle when I saw it
[7:56:16] datfishyboii: yeah. that kata is not jumping enough, i could clearly see her on my screen
[7:56:23] TDesius: Now my question is this
[7:56:32] TDesius: Wasn't it level 30 to do ranked?
[7:56:35] TDesius: Or have they lowered it
[7:56:39] Snoopy1118: It used to be.
[7:56:45] Zahlli: I thought it was 30
[7:56:57] datfishyboii: so why have levels then
[7:56:57] TDesius: WOAH
[7:56:59] TDesius: WOAH WOAH
[7:57:15] TDesius: I'll have you know, I actually overthink as Yasuo
[7:57:16] TDesius: LUL
[7:57:16] Snoopy1118: It is still supposed to be 30.
[7:57:22] Snoopy1118: According to Google.
[7:57:32] TDesius: Well according to this Garen that doesn't exist LUL
[7:57:37] TDesius: Garen is actually account level 24
[7:57:41] TDesius: And he's in ranked
[7:57:42] datfishyboii: they gonna FF
[7:58:02] theflameelement: doesnt it need to be lvl 30 to go rank?

[7:58:28] Valla0: yikers

[7:58:50] Pacifistlock: DAMNIT KAIF WHY ARE YOU USING THE ODIN ....oh wait wrong game
[7:58:51] RaiGrey: I queued up ranked after seeing your stream....I very much regret that
[7:59:15] TDesius: @PidgePlum They are Iron so probably a throw away account if they're spamming that
[7:59:29] Nightbot: Follow Kaif on Twitter and Instagram to see more pointless shit, and Doggo pics. https://www.twitter.com/kaiffyt https://www.instagram.com/iamkaiffu/
[7:59:30] GuildedCharr: Is this actually Iron?
[7:59:46] GuildedCharr: Never seen anyone in the rank.
[7:59:52] Valla0: esc -> interface -> scrolldown -> chat visibility
[8:00:00] TDesius: Isn't that the first one?
[8:00:14] reb00t: I stopped playing before Iron, im sure id be hard stuck there if I played again
[8:00:18] Nightbot: Rules: First do not harass other members of chat.  There is a limit on caps so dont use caps lock. Dont spam emotes. Don't spam commands, they are here for fun not to flood the chat.  NO 'back seat gaming' Kaif will play how he wants to play, unless he ask for help.  A mod voice is final, if they ask you to stop; you will stop.  When playing social deceit games if you have an assumption make it clear. Finally dont be a fucking cunt. kaifGrr kaifGrr
[8:00:19] datfishyboii: @GuildedCharr iron = plat
[8:00:27] datfishyboii: not much difference
[8:00:32] Pacifistlock: Y U BOLLIE
[8:00:37] TDesius: Kaif that's bullying
[8:00:41] TDesius: that's just bullying
[8:00:45] jazjez: If they playing ranked they did the tutorial plus like 10 games or something no?
[8:00:46] Zahlli: Dont bully the poor garen man
[8:00:47] Zumzar97: filthy kaif
[8:00:48] Caboozee2: shoulda chucked his controller instead of his account if he was raging
[8:00:51] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[8:00:57] GuildedCharr: @datfishyboii I mean, there very much is.
[8:00:58] Zumzar97: gonna make faren cry
[8:01:02] Snoopy1118: @TDesius To be fair, playing Lilia against most melee champs is just running circles around them.
[8:01:04] ovalodin: its okay kaif it is a garen player
[8:01:14] TDesius: Yeah but Snoopy
[8:01:21] TDesius: that right there was the equivalent of chasing a singed
[8:01:24] TDesius: You just don't
[8:01:34] datfishyboii: @GuildedCharr not from my experience
[8:01:35] Snoopy1118: I always chase Singed. >:D
[8:01:35] Zahlli: omg I hate singed
[8:01:46] Zahlli: singed forces me to chase him

[8:08:35] datfishyboii: so new players keep playing
[8:08:45] LarkenRisen: The new average is low gold, and normal mmr affects it so its super easy to start plat as a new player even if yorue terrible
[8:08:46] datfishyboii: of course, makes more money
[8:08:52] SirTeaMug: as lv 30 -40 ive been placed in plat

[8:10:46] datfishyboii: man the chapters are getting shorter and shorter nino

[8:11:00] datfishyboii: no surprise its taking years
[8:11:27] Ninosai: ain't got nothing to follow so it's milking the story as much as possible
[8:11:46] Zahlli: JJK is doing the same thing tbf
[8:12:00] Zahlli: Though the fights are a bit better
[8:12:13] TDesius: So wait wait wait, that guy is playing with 4 Iron Players, and get's ranked as Plat on a 1 Win, 4 Loss placement matches. Ranks are a fucking lie LUL
[8:12:16] TDesius: I am fucking lost
