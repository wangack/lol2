[5:43:49] GandorTheGreat: @hughjanus9001 looking good 😁
[5:46:52] Hayase64: Veigar, Shen, Karthus, Karma, Illaoi, Hwei, Gwen, Gragas, Garen, Darius, Camille an Ahri are getting buffs
[5:47:09] 9fierce9: Good first gank for the Viego NOTED
[5:47:09] dominosu_: wait gwen is getting buffed?
[5:47:20] dominosu_: shes already so hard to deal with rn
[5:47:25] FrozenLavaReflector: they did overnerf gwen
[5:47:34] coolwaveofcalm: I think Gwen did get overnerfed
[5:47:34] Hayase64: For Gwen it's just P AP ratio increased from 0.65% per 100 AP to 0.72%
[5:47:41] FrozenLavaReflector: it went from like 53 pre hotfix to 47 post
[5:47:54] FrozenLavaReflector: like massive over nerf
[5:48:08] FrozenLavaReflector: and even then, riftmaker is getting increased by 100 gold
[5:48:10] keiyashin: theyre also nerfing riftmaker so buff compensates
[5:49:13] Hayase64: For riftmaker they incraesed the price from 3000 to 3100
[5:49:15] dominosu_: @keiyashin oooh okay! that makes more sense
[5:50:52] Snakexstar: is Hwei basically aphelios but just AP?
[5:51:18] Hayase64: Teemo, Rumble, Jax, Fizz, Blitzcrank are getting nerfs
[5:52:07] neonpaintedpigeons: 5upDance 5upDance
[5:52:53] dominosu_: yea i run into the same problem a lot
[5:53:09] Joker_GGEZ: is every champion sorta viable around the same level in league btw?
[5:53:39] Joker_GGEZ: i feel like i see an insane variety of champs in these streams
[5:54:20] dominosu_: i havent seen a a taric for almost a month i swear
[5:54:39] jackiebee: our streamer made a friend
[5:54:43] mariekecath: I think that the higher level of player you are, the more niche the picks will probably be

[5:59:18] thekatherine: from friends to foes
[5:59:27] pureiinsanity: just dodge if u see pyke yep
[5:59:54] appple_the_pie: Why do you never play with a 5 Person Team?
[6:00:12] appple_the_pie: I mean with people you know
[6:00:21] Hayase64: The higher the rank the higher the % the of good teammates
[6:01:17] Halofan642: @appple_the_pie league doesnt really have a competitive 5s mode
[6:01:25] Halofan642: its primarily solo queue
[6:02:00] Halofan642: nah bro ur mmr is higher than mine has ever been.... and ur a retired old man Sadge
[6:02:27] GandorTheGreat: @halofan642 it has. U just can't play it whenever 🙂
[6:02:48] Halofan642: yeah i had low gm mmr in like s10 for a few weeks and that was it
[6:03:00] Halofan642: @GandorTheGreat true Sadge
[6:03:01] divax0x0: Sweat it out

[6:04:12] Halofan642: @appple_the_pie its just how the community is. league has a solo/duo queue and then "flex" queue, in flex you can queue 1/2/3/5 people but people dont take the flex queue ladder seriously
[6:04:17] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com

[6:06:02] Halofan642: @appple_the_pie there are some amateur tournaments yeah! for all skill levels, but theyre not that popular for lower ranks relative to how many people are at that elo
[6:06:10] soofki: got too complacent with excellent an excellent pyke
[6:06:23] SyntheeR: Those are just smurf challengers
[6:06:29] Halofan642: but if you wanted to play with gold friends, theres tournaments that span over weeks or weekend tournys
[6:06:31] Hayase64: Time to not miss cs *cracks nuckles*
