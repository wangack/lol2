[0:38:35] Counter_JG: alois can play many champs at high level
[0:39:34] Counter_JG: alois best riven in the world imo. he just knows the ins and outs of when to fight I would imagine

[1:18:30] baevermaas: WWW IS OPEN
[1:18:32] baevermaas: WW
[1:18:34] DJ_Photik: Hec is better than Lilia
[1:18:52] soux_ssb: it looked like he was malding
[1:18:55] opticdyno: the previous play is under review
[1:19:10] getsometalentloser: lobby reveal likely

[1:22:25] gtkhazix: ad assasssins need ihubris compared to ap.. every single ap item gives you minimum 4k health at fullbuild, if they remove the health on every mage item it would be fine to remove hubris
[1:22:31] DJ_Photik: You feel it you don't see it. Just like the wind
[1:23:12] getsometalentloser: @Santorin certain adc  are rushing hubris to lol

[1:24:42] DJ_Photik: Same
[1:24:43] NowBeing: It's a law
[1:24:46] soux_ssb: isnt support everyones second best
[1:24:50] 2cozy_: how’s your Olaf top?
[1:25:02] DJ_Photik: Old Corki
[1:25:10] DemionDemon: dont forget, Phreak used to be ADC. also dont forget, Phreak is on the balance team.

[1:31:05] hintIO: establish that gromp control
[1:31:07] thee_briefcase: reksai behind feels SO BAD tho
[1:31:53] darkkkona: some players are like ''lemme don't die, i'll get the kills eventually''
[1:32:30] darkkkona: HOLY

[1:35:55] KobzReformed: thats a tiler
[1:35:57] Ezelof: cool
[1:36:02] nautowar43: this jax mental
[1:36:14] morbidnumbskull: Champs who normally dont build crit items can now crit, like Rengar, Sett etc.
[1:36:57] Ezelof: … so far
[1:37:07] gamingground1: zoning q
[1:37:09] hintIO: gromp defended successfully, that was close
