[0:44:26] SuppCope: @lewhitehd69 16? right bro she looks young
[0:44:34] Teekwan: I didn't even realize that Seraphine and your hairstyle are matching, that's so cool GivePLZ
[0:44:35] Voidling_General: luckly singed has antiheal on ult, sadly he dies
[0:44:43] Darkcyter: Aatrox really got some high profile encounters didn't he? scarred Pantheon (Atreus) who still bears the charred scar on his chest, stabbed Tryndamere so bad that he got infused with blood magic and from the latest cinematic, 1v2'd Kayle and Morgana, Morg had to fall to get him... mad lad
[0:44:53] Breidaia: Happy Birthday, KP! May your day be filled with good games, good company and joy. kaypLove Also- I love your hair today!!
[0:44:55] Jaketin8: Aatrox dmg is absolutely stupid, i know he fed and all, but even when behind its stupidly high while being tankier than needed

[0:47:28] YamiCF: he ain’t the world ended for nothin
[0:47:29] kristykat_: 4/20 singed lovely
[0:47:29] Leaskk: him and viago are busted with that new item
[0:47:30] mrsparkei: ill report that singed im sorry
[0:47:36] xBoomShotBaby: anti heal needed
[0:47:37] sparkweee: Surely this is reportable right?
[0:47:40] UltimateCheese: Haaaappy birthdayyyy Kels!
[0:47:40] YamiCF: ender*
[0:47:42] Teekwan: Ahhh, i'm getting PTSD from his previous seasons when he used to be a raid boss

[0:47:51] The1997wiki: he is full lethal
[0:47:52] kimpm: boots
[0:47:56] The1997wiki: the heal is ionsane
[0:47:56] RavensWing: maybe swap out staff?
[0:47:56] sparkweee: I think you get rid of support item for morelos
[0:47:56] ObsceneSanity: your team has 3 anti heal.

[0:48:24] Cowcotin58: It's not his fault. Singed IS hard top play.
[0:48:29] redeux: panth should also get thorm he has lots of burst from him combo
[0:48:32] UltimateCheese: Hope u had a good bday so far

[0:48:56] sparkweee: @Cowcotin58 I feel like there is a difference from having a bad game and 20 deaths
[0:48:56] Jaketin8: Riot, adding bruiser item that crits and does tons of dmg and heals is FCKING BS, like wasnt last bruiser healing meta bad enough? No mythic limits and they slap that in? What next? bruiser item that gives 100% dmg immunity and 100000% dmg buff?
[0:48:59] adrianbugaj: did u dm me on discord yesterday?
[0:48:59] ancholy: Happy birthday kaypLove I hope you have an amazing day!

[0:49:14] Darkcyter: @The1997wiki @ancholy @sparkweee kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[0:49:27] adrianbugaj: if not then theres a fake discord account copying you
[0:49:28] arcadedani: he is not going to take dmg because of that one item
[0:49:29] The1997wiki: @Darkcyter kaypFlower kaypFlower kaypFlower
[0:49:32] mrsparkei: omg he took no dmg
[0:49:33] Viivica: No but that Aatrox is not fair
[0:49:36] mrsparkei: what is that
[0:49:41] Soff199: your team will reach him tho in terms of objects and levels. he is already 18 so if you hold out it should get easier
[0:49:45] atichii: this game shouldnt have been this long
[0:49:49] arcadedani: every basic that he does it heals him
[0:49:50] Jaketin8: @adrianbugaj Is it the same profile that is "Queen of basement" on the KP discord? IF not, then its fake like most times
[0:49:52] ancholy: @darkcyter kaypPengu
[0:49:54] Darke_Angle: @UltimateCheese kaypCozy kaypHello
[0:49:58] redeux: you 100% need morello and panth need thorn
[0:50:00] thewomanofblur: wtf is that aatrox healing
[0:50:10] adrianbugaj: @Jaketin8 whats the discord server name
[0:50:14] mxclavicles: usually as support you’d build antiheal if that’s an issue. you might want to sell archangels for Chem tech or morello but in this scenario I don’t think it’ll make too much of a difference. so if you have the money to just outright sell and buy antiheal I would but if not then don’t bother
[0:50:14] shan_192: nooo so close
[0:50:15] kristykat_: ggs :(

[3:27:21] Darkcyter: @Kowdbuff not just about difficulty, in fact I think they put enough trainer battle and rematches to level up, it's the pokemon designs, uniqueness in map design and stories, the replay value is crazy
