[2:35:35] rivulet_mera: @toxicoboyy Maybe but sudden impact giving lethality is moe valuable now that lethality is not level based and ingenious affects a lot of items like Sterak, Sundered Sky or Eclipse, and it is a 50% cooldown red wich is pretty insane imo

[2:36:48] intingkarthus: yeah they will fix it surely Clueless
[2:36:51] BATU2306: i am glad
[2:36:57] toxicoboyy: i guess walrus is happy lol
[2:37:05] thedreadfulgamer64: What do they mean by unstoppable? You cant stop the passive animation during an autoattack?
[2:37:08] 7MTO69: also garen
[2:37:12] kindredgotthighs: yone ulted aggressively holy shit
[2:37:12] rivulet_mera: Btw genuine question, isnt Spirit Visage more valuable on aatrox than rookern?? just asking cuz i dont even know
[2:37:17] topi1337: topi1337 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey man ! you inspired me to become aatrox main. Any general tips for beginner aatrox player ?
[2:37:24] rivulet_mera: @toxicoboyy yeah, remember me please, i have bad memory XD
[2:37:32] BATU2306: @HilariBarbae i guess it is caused because of passive uncancellability feature
[2:37:33] demarderozan11_696969: jiba
[2:37:35] nomainyett: @thedreadfulgamer64 it means that it 100% will go through stuns and is, well, unstoppable even by yourself
[2:37:40] BATU2306: is that even a word LUL
[2:38:01] aakashwani_: that was surprisingly very helpful
[2:38:02] eremiusow: eliminating  competition xd
[2:38:03] parttyFX: i like that they are making bruisers stronger like darius garen and camille, now toplane is gonna be more skilled and fun than playing against ranged champions

[2:59:38] adrianna_zmora: oh they have both Yasuo and Yone lmao
[2:59:39] lucky_oneee: I swear Diamond is just gold with a few steps
[2:59:42] adrianna_zmora: what a disaster
[2:59:49] toxicoboyy: @parttyFX since naayil didn't answer cuz he was busy i will ask you . If you go secondary runes red you can pick Ingenious hunter and the Sundered Sky cooldown will go tu 4 seconds per target wich is pretty insane, esentially half cooldow
[2:59:51] settonpush: @mohamadlefteye he is bulgarian or trukish i think
[3:00:06] plimx2: @cullinggameshibuyaarc jjk fan xd
[3:00:07] mohamadlefteye: @settonpush oh yeah could be too
[3:00:12] ANBU2434: @lucky_oneee like 1/4th more of a braincell amongst the 10 players thats the only real change

[3:00:36] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[3:00:42] parttyFX: @toxicoboyy not worth imo since you dont build letality anymore and revilatize and boneplating/second win make you laning much easier
[3:00:50] mohamadlefteye: lol
[3:00:55] plimx2: @cullinggameshibuyaarc :)

[3:01:38] toxicoboyy: @parttyFX ok thx for answer
[3:01:44] shind37: what makes sundered sky better than divine sunderer?
[3:01:44] alikaiserm: stun locked
[3:01:45] lucky_oneee: Did your keyboard and mouse disconnected? Why afk in the bush? HOLY CC
[3:01:51] parttyFX: @toxicoboyy and is also a bit useless because your full combo is around 6 seconds already so you can just proc it every combo with no problem
[3:01:55] mohamadlefteye: LUL
[3:01:55] itsrainingben2015: itsrainingben2015 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[3:01:57] ANBU2434: @shind37 its not better sundere just not in the game
[3:02:12] rivulet_mera: @parttyFX 9 lethality level 1 is 9 less armor enemy has wich is pretty good if you will fight earlygame (sudden impact is very very good rifght now on anything that can proc it consistently)
[3:02:15] lucky_oneee: Samira is terminal
[3:02:29] shind37: @ANBU2434 im aware but he used to say DS was ass
[3:02:32] vapegod_007: u build that new item every game ? or only if lot of mele
[3:02:48] rivulet_mera: @parttyFX With ingenious you proc it TWICE per combo, wich is a lot of bonus healing imo
[3:02:51] parttyFX: @toxicoboyy like revitalize with some chemtech drakes can be super broken and even more if you have healing or shielding champions on your team, also same with spirit visage
[3:02:59] Howlyy_: @lucky_oneee what hour is it in ur timezone?
[3:03:03] toxicoboyy: @shind37 ass on aatrox not fiora for example
[3:03:09] parttyFX: @Downpour_Riv why would you fight early game with 14s cooldown
[3:03:38] mohamadlefteye: i have like master mechanics but silver gamesense
[3:03:43] adrianna_zmora: D:
[3:03:49] rivulet_mera: @parttyFX He almost kills early every game lol, you can short trade early all the time (he does)
[3:04:05] apenasowade: two damage items and no damage wtf
[3:04:11] adrianna_zmora: is anti heal needed in this situation for draven???

[3:04:37] alikaiserm: in game ?
[3:04:55] toxicoboyy: @parttyFX you can also argua that lethality is as broken as before they nerfed it and added lethality in the game
[3:05:15] toxicoboyy: @toxicoboyy before there was just armor pen
[3:05:17] adrianna_zmora: u got this!!! 9 games winstreek manifest
[3:05:22] adrianna_zmora: WINNERQ
[3:05:37] Howlyy_: WINNERQ
[3:05:42] toxicoboyy: what winner q lol samira ints he just carrying
[3:05:47] parttyFX: @Downpour_Riv bro early kills aren't as good as they used to be idk i like getting +1500 bonus healing from just 1 rune
[3:05:58] Howlyy_: @toxicoboyy shh
[3:06:04] toxicoboyy: @parttyFX true respawn is faster
[3:06:17] toxicoboyy: can't snowball like before
[3:06:23] xavier10080: he just auto attacks he doesnt need to be good
[3:06:32] parttyFX: @toxicoboyy you fell off in mid/late game and games are so long now that is not worth it
[3:06:50] Arzofel: you have to survive the brand tho
[3:06:54] parttyFX: @toxicoboyy games are so slow that letality is not good anymore on aatrox
[3:07:01] noct1s1: resist item?
[3:07:02] LoLesttK: nice
[3:07:05] rivulet_mera: @parttyFX lethality is a god stat right now, not just for early kills but for daamge over all and bonus healing is good but extra procs of steraks eclipse and sundered sky are way big value, you esentially double item efficiency
[3:07:06] intingkarthus: POGGIES
[3:07:07] xavier10080: WINNERQ WINNERQ
[3:07:10] El_Mecanicouille: winnable ?

[3:07:37] xavier10080: FoN for the ms?
[3:07:54] ShuIkin: his pet
[3:08:08] parttyFX: @Downpour_Riv ye bro there is not really good lethality items for aatrox rn change my mind
[3:08:30] settonpush: The omen negated yone damage
[3:08:30] Yoshiiyuki: it looked like you dodged it tbh
[3:08:31] lucky_oneee: Brand is super healthy for the game :)
[3:08:32] parttyFX: like lethality aatrox cant kill yone there
[3:08:37] C0st1nh4: jak sho is great rn no ?
[3:08:38] toxicoboyy: @parttyFX true
[3:08:49] Yoshiiyuki: but maybe e too late
[3:09:03] Howlyy_: is death dance good tho?
[3:09:06] toxicoboyy: @C0st1nh4 it's scale on percent armor so if you don't buy armor/mr you don't get value
[3:09:24] rivulet_mera: @parttyFX Even if you dont build lethality, sudden impact is a great rune man, i am talking about lethality because the only problem ingenious hunter has is that there are no usefull red runes but sudden impact is so good right now it can be worth to take sudden + ingenious
[3:09:25] zaidth: who is better at their champ you or spear?
[3:09:32] C0st1nh4: @toxicoboyy got ya
[3:09:48] lucky_oneee: Braindead question tbh @zaidth
[3:10:07] parttyFX: @toxicoboyy like with duskblade serylda it made sense because the slow+ armor pen and bonus dmg on Q when low hp enemy, but no there is no point
[3:10:10] zaidth: @lucky_oneee why?
[3:10:21] toxicoboyy: @C0st1nh4 ye hp items are better now like shojin and sundered sky
[3:10:25] dajmimalopljuge: chat what is good vs aatrox
[3:10:39] toxicoboyy: @parttyFX they killed serylda lol
[3:10:40] parttyFX: @parttyFX no point rn no good lethality items for aatroxc
[3:10:43] sadkatto: no one is here Clueless
[3:10:51] thedreadfulgamer64: GJ
[3:10:51] settonpush: @dajmimalopljuge any all in champ pee on him early game
[3:10:55] nutterbuttersmm: sundered sky diff
[3:10:55] C0st1nh4: @toxicoboyy yeah that's pretty much core on aatrox rn

[3:13:45] VALLZO: you mean forg1ven
[3:13:52] BYGAI228: Do you aware of Aatrox pbe bug?
[3:13:55] toxicoboyy: @dajmimalopljuge i don't think so because with malph you are always usefull for your team and  there will be a point where you get unkillable and plus now games are slow af so you will always get to that unkillable point
[3:13:58] tyran8r: @dajmimalopljuge Irelia, Fiora,Yone,Jax pick one and go
[3:13:59] parttyFX: @toxicoboyy play tp revitalize and boneplating/secondwind runes and with good cs you can really tank and deal good dmg
