[0:15:09] Nightbot: Nick really likes the new Asol. For him its OG Asol > post rework Asol > pre rework Asol. You generate stacks by either having enemies die in your E, Champions stand in your E, hit by your R or Qing them for longer than a second at a time. Stacks strenghen your abilities, making them stronger and larger. You should have at least 10/stacks a minute early game and then more than that the longer the game goes. blehhhhhhhhhh
