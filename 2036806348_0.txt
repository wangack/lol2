[1:08:02] OrbitalPeacock: aww he apologized
[1:08:18] Adamonus: is sunderer sky still bugged with hydra?
[1:08:49] phunktional: she has blue too
[1:09:12] TouchMyFish: doesn't her AoE heal have a rather long cooldown?
[1:09:31] vuminhgiang124: Hi Ipav, how's your jungler lately?
[1:09:54] OrbitalPeacock: how come nobody builds kraken slayer anymore
[1:10:40] kablooom: perro de nosotros?
[1:12:22] jordyutopia: nuestro perro
[1:13:29] kablooom: kraken aint bad either.. like 500 dmg procs
[1:14:28] xxpops: this build is closer to it
[1:14:41] omared123: zeinBravo
[1:14:56] Azta1212: gg
[1:16:09] kablooom: theres plenty movespeed in runes
[1:16:25] xxpops: it stacks on hit
[1:16:55] xxpops: it stacks mvmt speed on hit and attack speed
[1:17:10] xxpops: wait read it wrong
[1:17:17] xxpops: only attack speed
[1:18:00] xxpops: hexplate activation movment speed ?
[1:18:35] OrbitalPeacock: Idk why they nerfed it, nobody used to build it
[1:18:49] knowndepth: they said next patch PD getting zeal back in build path
[1:19:14] kablooom: lol never.
[1:19:30] xxpops: me either, i built the first one on old poppy :P
[1:20:36] kablooom: storm razer for some movespeed
[1:20:57] xxpops: hexplate?
[1:21:27] kablooom: hexplate cooldown is turn off
[1:21:47] xxpops: but hexplate has health which scales w/ tank item and terminus
[1:21:58] xxpops: vs crit
[1:22:33] xxpops: and teemo has a bunch of ult's so maybe worth
[1:22:44] Healthnote: LMAO
[1:22:47] OrbitalPeacock: I guess you pay for the burn
[1:23:00] kablooom: yeah but the cooldown shuts off the killing sprees
[1:24:50] suppaahh: I think I may need to experiment with a build with nashors plus lich
[1:25:18] OrbitalPeacock: 🤔 🤔 🤔
[1:25:24] OrbitalPeacock: new day new buiod
[1:25:39] kablooom: plus cosmic drive to help lower cd to proc lich
[1:26:12] suppaahh: @kablooom maybe
[1:26:47] kablooom: @suppaahh then deathcap for mass murder
[1:26:49] suppaahh: @kablooom plus cosmic gives movespeed when shroom hits
[1:26:58] kablooom: @suppaahh My man!
[1:27:25] kablooom: they cant kill you if they are blinded every other second
[1:27:57] suppaahh: @kablooom its very hard to get the q cd low
[1:28:06] kablooom: 4.5s is enough
[1:29:39] kablooom: malignance could work if you hide on top of shroom and fight.. they prob wont run out of aoe
[1:30:27] suppaahh: not going for a shroom build, malignance is only good for shrooms
[1:30:28] kablooom: very setup based unfortunately
[1:30:34] WilsonSeeToh: I saw SRO new video he play Heart steel, Liandry and shadow flame Teemo. How would you rank that build?
[1:31:01] suppaahh: more like an ap bruiser/fighter build
[1:31:21] xxpops: trinity force and cleaver are the only two items w/ movement speed on hit
[1:31:26] kablooom: Yeah but ask yourselves which would be more fun lol
[1:33:41] OrbitalPeacock: FeelsGoodMan
[1:35:32] yashaomegalul: how legend u are captain
[1:36:31] Healthnote: that's not maokai
[1:37:00] kablooom: just invis and soak up exp lol
[1:38:29] kablooom: time for broke teemo build. 2200 morellos
[1:40:30] suppaahh: Anyone whos face against opponents with brains know DH isnt good on teemo
[1:42:32] blessedinside: @ipav999 what do you think about malignance?
[1:43:36] eduardou01: BLUBBERS
[1:43:56] PhilosoPhiddle: @ipav999 I am sure you know this, but arm guard has the single use stop watch active now

[1:53:54] tvonthesonar: is that normal? that feels slow
[1:54:08] tvonthesonar: oh there he goes
[1:54:10] Tenaciousorb: i think if you take 2 from everywave it doesnt gold decrease... maybe
[1:55:32] PhilosoPhiddle: @ipav999 Manco has been playing bot lane adc (still building Ap) with a second support item. So yeah, I think the 2nd support item punishment is not active or less at the moment.
[2:01:13] suppaahh: that item is why I dont care about shroom teemo anymore
[2:02:23] suppaahh: ingenious hunter> ultimate, if u have zhonyas and banshees
[2:03:51] xkayden0: ezreal stole it
[2:11:23] iPSGi: Top
[2:14:12] blessedinside: @ipav999 have you tried liandry, malignance, shadowflame build? :)
[2:17:13] PhilosoPhiddle: @blessedinside yeah he has. They are all great Ap teemo items. But you're just gunna be tissue paper with only dmg items
[2:17:19] Aldurfus: jax looking balanced as always ipavKEK
[2:18:01] PhilosoPhiddle: That Kayn was pretty bad
[2:18:55] diknballz420: that jax player "ToP gAP" COPIUM
[2:18:58] blessedinside: @philosophiddle 2 more free slots+defensive boots+bone p+exhaust?
[2:20:04] PhilosoPhiddle: @blessedinside Yeah, it can totally work. Just gunna be squishy if build order is all dmg first
[2:20:24] PhilosoPhiddle: But still all great items
[2:20:33] suppaahh: nashors instead?
[2:21:23] diknballz420: ROA could be viable. I use that when I need AP and health. gives  mana  too
[2:23:36] Bonyeti: Did the extra Teemo nerfs already drop or are they still in test server?
[2:23:37] diknballz420: *getting pen and paper*
[2:23:47] blessedinside: @philosophiddle I just don’t understand why go defensive items doesn’t teemo is a dmg dealer? (I’m new to game)
[2:24:19] diknballz420: mmm yeah
[2:24:44] diknballz420: @blessedinside you become a glass cannon. Too squishy
[2:25:32] blessedinside: but other adcs/mages squishy 2, no?
[2:26:58] diknballz420: yeah but IMO, teemo is a kiter. You need to get in close to attack but since you do, you have to soak some amount of enemy damage.
[2:27:16] diknballz420: Teemo has no cc. so you just have to kite.
[2:28:03] blessedinside: soo he’s just an apc?
[2:28:24] PhilosoPhiddle: @diknballz420 There is nothing wrong with going all dmg. You can carry thousands of games with all dmg builds and climb. iPav been playing Teemo for years and years. And wants to play diverse builds at higher lvls. That is just hard at the moment. And the all AP burst dmg build will fall off hard as you climb past gold/plat.
[2:29:02] diknballz420: @PhilosoPhiddle 100% agree. 100%
[2:29:16] blessedinside: @philosophiddle ahh tysm :)
[2:29:40] notthath: terminus
[2:30:51] PhilosoPhiddle: No prob. Things like Ap bust dmg Teemo can be absolutely amazing and work insanely well at one elo. And be really hard / not work at all at other elo. So it isn't a wrong build, he is just looking for many builds, or at least a few that can work at higher elos
[2:33:12] blessedinside: ait ty now I understand :)
[2:35:30] xxpops: agree and it has crit which is kinda a wasted
[2:36:20] PhilosoPhiddle: @ipav999 Have you tested Terminus much? The resist is very tempting, but ideally you need some HP from somewhere to use those resist.
[2:36:40] diknballz420: ^
[2:38:00] PhilosoPhiddle: yeah that seems good. What is def difference if you change Jak'sho for Experimental Hexplate?
[2:38:05] xxpops: hexplate or wits end would fit in there
[2:39:09] xxpops: heart steal and grasp? or is that too weak
[2:39:52] Cottard__: is there any hp + damage item to replace runan? isn't there another version of the mercure item with hp too?
[2:40:03] xxpops: yes there is
[2:40:06] xxpops: hexplate
[2:41:16] xxpops: hexplate, stridebreaker all have hp, attackdamage, and attack speed
[2:41:20] xxpops: might be another
[2:41:37] PhilosoPhiddle: @Cottard__ ohh shit I think they removed the other Qss item, so no. Silver Mace items is gone I believe.
[2:42:10] Cottard__: @PhilosoPhiddle oh that's sad
[2:42:12] xxpops: the have cinderbloom which works as qss but....  you have to build the whole item to get it
[2:42:24] diknballz420: @xxpops exp hexplate also gives haste on ultimate. thats a plus.
[2:42:45] xxpops: ya i think hexplate would be good but he ignores me :) when i suggest it lol
[2:42:55] PhilosoPhiddle: @diknballz420 Yeah I really want to see it work on teemo
[2:43:13] PhilosoPhiddle: He has tried it @xxpops
[2:44:00] diknballz420: and it gives you a speed boost. a bit lacking in the ult damage but like ipav is talking about, your not going a AP DOT build.
[2:44:12] PhilosoPhiddle: RFC for crit is a must no?
[2:44:17] xxpops: ya the shrooms would be for the slows and vision
[2:44:20] xxpops: in this build
[2:44:45] Cottard__: runnan?
[2:44:52] diknballz420: Yeah ipav used exp. hexplate like 1 week ago. if you want to dig around in the twitch archives =D
[2:45:05] Cottard__: fanthom dancer?
[2:45:11] PhilosoPhiddle: Runnans feels sooo nice for clear, just isn't worth the dmg per gold sadly. But I still love to get it anyway lol
[2:45:45] xxpops: he used hexplate in the shroom cd build
[2:45:50] xxpops: i saw that
[2:47:25] Maveriyk: Would a Rylais ever make it into the build?
[2:48:04] xxpops: he hates rylias about as much as triforce

[2:50:03] xxpops: 20ms
[2:54:43] blessedinside: ludens gives mana?
[2:54:44] xxpops: +mana flow band
[2:56:17] xxpops: 120
[2:56:48] xxpops: 10 percent of 600 is 60x2
[2:57:34] xxpops: ya my quick math, is to make 600 60 then times 2
[2:58:32] xxpops: going ROA probably shit too
[2:59:33] xxpops: 890 times 5
[3:00:06] xxpops: thought it was 890 times 5
[3:00:28] xxpops: gotcha
[3:01:46] blessedinside: roa?
[3:02:21] xxpops: i dont know if teemo spams enough spells for roa
[3:04:27] xxpops: cinderbloom instead of void staff? or just too weak?
[3:05:44] xxpops: Cryptbloom*
[3:08:06] xxpops: void staff + qss = 4300 gold or Cryptbloom = 2850  is something to consider
[3:08:45] gilwinterwood: does teemo do good vs sett?
[3:10:18] jordyutopia: riftmaker? or is bad?
[3:10:21] gilwinterwood: but malignance is good for the ult cooldown reduction
[3:12:02] blessedinside: in teamfight each champ and each tick procs it
[3:15:49] xxpops: the thumbnail I read for cryptbloom was incorrect.   Thought it had an active ability
[3:20:42] blessedinside: practice tool tests?
[3:25:26] xxpops: waiting for the sundered sky build :)
[3:26:11] One_HUNNIT: what runes you like to run
