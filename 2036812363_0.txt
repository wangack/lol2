[4:05:44] piggietheone: Sup matt
[4:05:49] MattadorMatt: <3
[4:06:02] KashMoneyKale: chat has cupic been abusing double enchanter to R1
[4:06:09] ddemarco5: hmm it would appear they heal-tanked your entire ault
[4:06:12] MannyAki: omg mundo lives
[4:06:13] WangnanJa: love double support
[4:06:19] KnightArn: damn that healing is crazy
[4:06:21] Lirhist: They can tank the whole ult LOL
[4:06:23] Soner77: what is this season actually
[4:06:24] CaptMalReynolds: Meanwhile Mundo 1v4 your team
[4:06:27] podduhh: this has been the first season where I’ve thought, “time to find a new game”
[4:06:27] MattadorMatt: Raid boss
[4:06:31] doxxa: THEY DO NOT DIE
[4:06:33] Schultinator: how much healing have you reduced?
[4:06:40] ddemarco5: im gunna chalk this game up as silly
[4:06:40] neverwillno: can u chcek antiheal on orb
[4:06:41] BirdsAndCarrion: The fact that those champs can still do any dmg whatsoever is disgusting. If they build support, they should support other people. A mundo, sona, soraka team shouldnt do literally any dmg
[4:06:50] Schultinator: yikes
[4:06:58] Lirhist: @BirdsAndCarrion Agreed
[4:07:00] RiotEnemy: xDDD
[4:07:11] k_anga: how did your brother do in the smite tournament @lourlo
[4:07:18] Lirhist: Too much damage in the game
[4:07:19] piggietheone: tab for a sec
[4:07:21] RiotEnemy: The support item gives them gold to keep up and it protects them from dmg
[4:07:23] kkrazy1: they just get sooooo much gold
[4:07:25] jimimimimimy: damn
[4:07:25] MannyAki: yikes
[4:07:26] jimimimimimy: BIG
[4:07:26] Nightbot: 32512 BIG s in the chat
[4:07:37] Kennentic: Changing the game is KPI for the designers
[4:07:39] Bakery: the item is now stronger, gives gold faster, and costs no gold itself
[4:07:40] MattadorMatt: sajj
[4:07:44] kkrazy1: Yeah
[4:07:47] RiotEnemy: Gold plus item passive
[4:07:54] RiotEnemy: read the passive on that shit, its broken af
[4:07:55] josho_rising: @Lourlo what role do you play in smite?
[4:08:09] WangnanJa: your team has no dps
[4:08:09] piggietheone: lourlo look my clip
[4:08:10] ddemarco5: the support items are just very very strong
[4:08:21] piggietheone: i sent it in best plays
[4:08:21] MattadorMatt: Lourlo about to become a smite player
[4:08:24] Noftie: this game NotLikeThis
[4:08:25] KashMoneyKale: yeah, thank god im not playing this shit
[4:08:25] piggietheone: its crown
[4:08:25] TotalIyNotATaco: @piggietheone no
[4:08:27] sktkuribo: lo smurfs top every game, i look away for 5 mins and its doomed...
[4:08:28] TotalIyNotATaco: staree
[4:08:31] RiotEnemy: 35% dmg reduction hahahahha
[4:08:35] Lirhist: Why is that 75%
[4:08:36] TeamLiquid: Break Through Your Game with the new Alienware Pro Wireless Mouse and Keyboard!  go.adv.gg/Ce42s9
[4:08:37] Lirhist: What the fuck
[4:08:42] ddemarco5: yep
[4:08:44] Sterfex64: holy fuck
[4:08:47] Evillilace: can we get a nidalee top game
[4:08:47] ghxst212: 500 g item btw
[4:08:49] Lirhist: RioT?!?!?
[4:08:49] RiotEnemy: yeah its the dmg reduction
[4:08:50] konungr___: have you seen the clips of janna solokilling ppl
[4:08:55] Lirhist: 75% is absurd
[4:09:00] CaptMalReynolds: It's BETTER than crown by a large margin
[4:09:00] BirdsAndCarrion: Yeah, the new support items were a terrible idea
[4:09:01] RiotEnemy: it is
[4:09:03] kkrazy1: and it gives insane gold
[4:09:04] ddemarco5: it's crown aftershock
[4:09:10] ddemarco5: and 5 gold per 10
[4:09:18] piggietheone: lourlo flowing staff gives ap and old shurelyas passive
[4:09:24] jimimimimimy: bloodsong is insane too
[4:09:25] RiotEnemy: Its such an ez fix and they just wont do it
[4:09:30] MindStatic64: Needs to be nerfed to 40 seconds
[4:09:30] jimimimimimy: the support items are just way overtuned
[4:09:32] KashMoneyKale: time for smite YEP chipichipichapachapadubidubidabadabamagicomidubidubiboomboomboom
[4:09:42] granolasoul: nah nah nah. support items aren’t OP
[4:09:42] nicolestarcraft: the item could have 0 stats and be broken
[4:09:49] MtkFrost: alt account if so sam
[4:09:52] Noftie: YEP
[4:09:57] Horia_Darie: isn't fiora just hard carrying every game?
[4:10:00] BirdsAndCarrion: Build support item top xdd
[4:10:02] KashMoneyKale: @nicolestarcraft the item could take away stats and be broken
[4:10:09] Retrotrack: Sadge

[4:10:24] Soner77: its infuriating
[4:10:25] TotalIyNotATaco: NOPE
[4:10:27] ddemarco5: @Lourlo next patch they're making the gold per 10 passive global I believe.
[4:10:30] geraldfans: Darius counts Mundo :)
[4:10:32] BirdsAndCarrion: Who is doing dmg on their team?
[4:10:33] Zondoul: an you check shields and healing senna denied?
[4:10:33] ddemarco5: so only 1 person can get it
[4:10:38] Lirhist: Right
[4:10:43] Noftie: that was going so well until it wasnt
[4:10:43] KashMoneyKale: theres actually justno way to play against that shit if the game isnt over by 10 mins
