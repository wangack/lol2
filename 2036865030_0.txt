[3:23:13] Kudosa: YEP
[3:24:00] sleepvertical: what‚Äôs crazy is there is a clip of you posted 8 years ago catching a scripter in almost the same way, league never changes haha @wingsofdeath
[3:24:18] sleepvertical: in case you want to see it cause it‚Äôs crazy I remembered it
[3:24:40] Belph2: if someone always moves to dodge its one thing.. but if they only do it perfectly at some times... yeah big flag
[3:25:18] Kudosa: and for the perfect diffrence. They don't dodge more than they have to usually
[3:25:23] Kudosa: just the exact right amount
[3:25:32] xBloODOmeNx: riot made the anticheat but when are they implementing it? cmonBruh

[3:27:44] Etty3: but what other solution is there to scripting?
[3:27:49] Etty3: and cheating
[3:27:49] Galkaria: gotta buy just a streaming PC
[3:27:56] squallphin: Fuck vanguard
[3:28:05] ShadowQueen4289: I had to do that to get rid of the epic games launcher
[3:28:13] Galkaria: @Etty3 let's install cameras in every household to prevent abuse, that sounds like a good idea, right?
[3:28:44] ShadowQueen4289: like I had to uninstall like three or four things a handful of times it felt like üòÖüòÇ
[3:29:11] Etty3: @Galkaria I get your point but my question was genuine, ik i sound like a vanguard chill but i just dont want cheaters AND not getting spied on if possible
[3:29:20] itszat0ichi: im not installing that, i think ill prob quit my aram games D:
[3:29:21] SFS_Trailmix: the fact that they need kernel access is terrifying
[3:29:22] Kudosa: Why would I trust someone that had to rework their spaghetti client several times for it to still be bugged with my PCs security...
[3:29:24] Galkaria: same thing, you can't just blanket discipline the world for the actions of a few, you catch the cheaters doing cheating things, and leave the normal, non-cheating people alone, you don't let the police install hardware in your house
[3:29:46] Kudosa: Even if Riot doesn't fuck shit up. Its still a backdoor for other people

[3:30:59] Galkaria: 23 and me recently had a data breach, generations of data being exposed and stolen, and the only thing the company said was "tough shit, your own fault"
[3:31:22] StevenWeener: they are so incompetent at their client and shit, even if they dont want to mess with it, they will
[3:31:25] ShadowQueen4289: watching wings and crocheting is the best part of my night üòã

[3:33:38] SFS_Trailmix: Warzone has the same kernel access anti-cheat with Ricochet, and recently info just came out that insiders have been selling hardware for like 500-700$ a pop.
[3:33:42] MrDeathtoy: did he lose anyway?
[3:33:43] Red_Fr0st_: why not check it tho? DansGame
[3:33:53] ikkesander: wait they dont check that

[3:39:00] Manutzaaa: e and r
[3:39:05] OwnedRacoonTv: OwnedRacoonTv watched 10 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! Hell yesh

[3:39:42] majistimus2000: Jax is op
[3:39:50] Red_Fr0st_: a lot of players are playing valorant without any problems tho + you ve ran it 3 years ago in beta
[3:40:13] SFS_Trailmix: Im sure allowing a company like Riot to have all my info stored on their servers is wise
[3:40:19] SFS_Trailmix: we must trust their tencent overlorfs
[3:40:32] Etty3: cool skin
[3:40:33] Gizan: I would trust Riot with my life
[3:40:47] Galkaria: @Kudosa you're damn right, i'd rather deal with cheaters than forcibly installing an app to 'watch over me to ensure games stay pure'
[3:40:48] squallphin: My main problem is sooner or later a group of hackers will find a vulnerability and they will take over your pc,is not if but when is going to happen
[3:41:23] SFS_Trailmix: @squallphin this... or your info ends up in a public/private data dump on a forum somewhere
