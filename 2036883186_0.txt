[1:08:03] miniWD40: idk why i'd be happy to full on cook a whole meal for my SO but something about just peeling an orange is weird lmao
[1:08:04] larcetae: i think it's because the act of taking time to peel/cut fruit for someone is a lot more intimate than just doing it for yourself, yeah??
[1:08:08] callmecy2197: ya, as long as it's not like an everyday thing
[1:08:10] gogh_van_go: it can be like... peel this boiled egg or shrimp too... to make it a bit more challenging XD
