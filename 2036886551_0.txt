[2:22:54] JustDaxton1: i dont think cryptbloom anyone is good
[2:22:55] JaoPing: brand in general is strong for no reason
[2:22:56] CHOHSAN: Can Braum build AP?
[2:23:06] 19yruj: cryptbloom is good for cdr and for how cheap it is
[2:23:17] 19yruj: I p much alweays go crypt now

[2:23:47] nukeowl07: Gotta say, pekin's looking mighty dapper in that shirt today
[2:23:49] CHOHSAN: I think Crypt Bloom is fine. It's essentially a Void Rod that does something more than magic pen.
[2:23:56] 67se: omg varus stay
[2:24:02] CHOHSAN: It still gives 30%, thugh, so they can't make its effect THAT strong.
[2:24:04] Oreganeaux: and I never knew until I went in for work
[2:24:04] corator1um: i guess you guys arent losing that bad because bounties are falling off

[2:28:19] Komlin111: @JustDaxton1 if you want to be indepenant and make a pile of money I guess, but might as well go work for a oil company and prob make more.
[2:28:35] gaelcete: wat is the build patg for ga now?
[2:28:36] brandoom1312: My dad worked for UPS and the plane he was on crashed and he was stranded on a desert island for almost a year. Then when he was rescued his wife remarried.

[2:29:45] CHOHSAN: Imagine fighting something you can't see.
[2:29:48] lightriver29: Lasagna is pasta
[2:29:52] CHOHSAN: It even sounds crazy.
[2:29:55] Komlin111: Hmmge saw that coming lol
[2:29:59] couchpotatoeater: Twitch is cringe . Says the innovator of ap twitch :D
[2:30:00] Oreganeaux: oil companies are probably more dependent on economy that train conductor I imagine. I lived in an oil town and when the economy was bad the whole town suffered so much for ot
[2:30:04] statics_2: did they bring back items stats or they still gone?

[2:30:45] brandoom1312: Lasagna is Spaghetti cake
[2:30:49] statics_2: @chohsan sadge
[2:30:55] isthesam19: flash timer
[2:30:56] CHOHSAN: They mentioned something in an AMA about being too lazy or too incompetent to bring item stats back now, but that they might in the future, I believe.
[2:30:56] lightriver29: @vanillaboy17 The enemy ADC's flash is at 36mins 30s

[2:32:02] 1TheRedFox: @lightriver29 is there supposed to be a g in there? I thought its just olio
[2:32:14] CHOHSAN: Just know that everywhere you go there is a stealthed rat that out ranges and out damages you and has movement speed boost in and attack speed boost out of stealth.
[2:32:18] CHOHSAN: And he will kill you.
[2:32:20] lightriver29: @1TheRedFox yeah miss type

[2:33:56] CHOHSAN: Well, that was a win.
[2:34:00] brandoom1312: PecanWolf you seem to be a bright young man. Perhaps a Champ with high IQ might be a good fit for you. Might I interest you in Heimerdinger?
[2:34:03] 67se: ggez
[2:34:04] CHOHSAN: I wouldn't have bet on it.
[2:34:10] Komlin111: JustChatting ezgg
[2:34:11] CHOHSAN: I wasn't really paying attention, though.
[2:34:11] galiaado: PecanWolf you seem to be a bright young man. Perhaps a Champ with high IQ might be a good fit for you. Might I interest you in Heimerdinger?

[2:34:44] gaelcete: wdy never honor ur team mates lmao
[2:34:56] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: xdd 󠀀
[2:35:01] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: PJSalt
[2:35:10] brandoom1312: Blitz 30% WR
[2:35:35] CHOHSAN: NA giving toxic EUW a run or their capitalism.
[2:35:37] 19yruj: lethality ashe actually does damage now you should try
[2:35:38] Oreganeaux: how about some one shot fizz mid
[2:35:39] statics_2: that shit should never come out
[2:35:53] JaoPing: i want riot to bring back ap rengar
[2:35:57] bannedghoul: lethality briar sucks
[2:35:58] PinkWardlol: ap blitz mid, malignance rush for R cdr so you can clear waves. Then stormsurge Kappa
[2:35:59] 67se: omegalul
[2:36:01] Komlin111: lolBriar with hydra was dank
[2:36:06] saphiq: is naafiri mid no longer good?
[2:36:23] Cion02: you think ap smolder is somehow playable
[2:36:33] PinkWardlol: was that when they were trying to make him a jgler?
[2:36:34] CHOHSAN: THey wanted him to be a support only again.
[2:36:39] PinkWardlol: maybe his clearw as too fast in the jgl?
[2:36:40] Jozu_50: riot hates fun
[2:36:41] CHOHSAN: THey gave up on jungle Bitz.
[2:36:45] 19yruj: @Cion02 look at his yt vid
[2:36:46] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: they feared some coinflip strat
[2:36:51] Komlin111: he was broken for one patch at least I think
[2:36:57] CHOHSAN: Nah, it was jungle or suport.
[2:37:12] 19yruj: @Cion02 its pbe tho so ig he was smurfing
[2:37:22] PinkWardlol: there are like 50 champs that have jgl inc damage too that don't jgl KEKW darius, garen, sion
[2:37:34] CHOHSAN: Most of what League does makes little sense.
[2:37:37] magoosemagoose: magoosemagoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:37:44] giul_9: @pekinwoof is there a champ you never played? Like Nami or something?
[2:37:46] brandoom1312: Heimerdinger is best jungler imo
[2:37:47] KittenWithThumbs: they jungle in low ranks sometimes
[2:37:50] Formallynx: no
[2:37:51] KittenWithThumbs: but thats about it
[2:37:55] zestyspider: I tried asol jg cause I remembered he had jg mods and it felt horrible
[2:38:14] PinkWardlol: maybe malignance first item rakan for R cdr and locking them in malignance zone

[2:38:43] PinkWardlol: didn't they buff his ratios recently?
[2:38:45] magoosemagoose: would be so fun
[2:38:59] Oreganeaux: I really wish Ornn could upgrade antiheal items
[2:39:00] ScriptumRasa: I think broxah tried ornn and said it seemed okay
[2:39:25] Byrn_22: total 200% is kinda low right?
[2:39:30] CHOHSAN: I get upset even seeing that on my team?

[2:40:19] JustCallMeBug: I'd let rakan top
[2:40:26] 19yruj: go go
[2:40:27] Komlin111: xayah lookUp top rakan
[2:40:30] PinkWardlol: I think malignance could do well. You R>W R procs malignance on them, -mr, so your W Q do more damage and they're stuck in the zone
[2:40:32] 19yruj: rakan time
[2:40:37] 19yruj: or corki
[2:40:37] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: BASED
[2:40:37] CHOHSAN: @JustCallMeBug Rakan's not a top. Stare

[2:41:07] Oreganeaux: Pekin can we get a fizz game or something?
[2:41:10] CHOHSAN: @CHOHSAN Well if we're living in your imagination might as well call Ezreal over to be a "top" too. YEP
[2:41:13] brandoom1312: Heimerdinger
[2:41:14] miguelangelthelittleduck: @PekinWoof Is brand still a pretty good pick?

[3:00:32] k_anga: it’s not a very good joke anyways
[3:00:33] ChadingoYitten: 10 years old?
[3:00:37] readerotl: lore wise like 1k years old
[3:00:46] 67se: kek she throwin' bands to cele
[3:00:46] joeshmoeblowman: wouldn’t storm surge be good on her

[3:01:54] Nightbot: The Pasta incident of 7/8/2022. Imagine if you weren't too engrossed in the pasta video, we could have accepted queue pop.
[3:01:55] WhiteOilOtter: true

[3:02:08] 19yruj: true I saw a vid by this pekiwoof guy today that was so disingenuous
[3:02:11] joeshmoeblowman: thoughts on zwag
[3:02:16] jirachix_x: heyy pek and chat
[3:02:31] Komlin111: !zwag
[3:02:31] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[3:02:35] ChadingoYitten: wow dmg
[3:03:07] 67se: woof
[3:03:09] 19yruj: !pekinfan
[3:03:09] Nightbot: I hope Pekin wins xD. I’m a Pekin fan and he’s just so pro!! People get so trolled by his outplays, and his voice is so cute like when he says "okay" LOL! He’s super random but also better than he looks, just like me xD
[3:03:12] readerotl: AWOO
[3:03:33] kitsunethunder: !pekinfan2
[3:03:33] Nightbot: If PekinWoof has a million fans I am one of them. If PekinWoof has ten fans I am one of them. If PekinWoof has only one fan, that is me. If PekinWoof has no fans, that means I am no more on the earth. If the world is against the PekinWoof, I am against the world.
