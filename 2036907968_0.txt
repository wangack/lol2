[0:07:47] HASTERIOUS: He*
[0:07:47] Wolfmanmoore: right?
[0:08:22] HASTERIOUS: Udyr is really good in this situation since top side doesn't really have a way to stop him
[0:08:28] eracelol: what’s up monte
[0:08:36] Joaz: HUH this isnt LEC what is this? Kappa
[0:08:53] eracelol: I love the LFN content btw
[0:09:09] Zebrios: Hwei is another one of those power creep champions like Zeri was on release.  He's gonna be nerfed.
[0:09:29] eracelol: listening to your voice brings me back to sitting in bed with a bowl of ice cream the last night of spring break <3
[0:09:32] frannyboy: Good to see the GOATs Pyosik and Beryl unite to run it back at worlds 2024
[0:09:48] apsleepy: Hey Monte, what's your take on the OWL? Do you have any thoughts on what would have kept that league going?
[0:09:58] Joaz: what do you think of Kcorp making esport a more physical experience with their rental arena for 26 weeks out of the year ?
[0:10:17] Nytrodark: @montecristo hey monte are you going to live view the t1 acad rekkles game in 30mins?
[0:10:19] budgettaimou: dom's best damn league show episode should start with the undertaker music
[0:10:34] HASTERIOUS: 3 sums for 2, not worth lolol
[0:10:34] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:10:35] Joaz: @budgettaimou dom paid for that
[0:10:43] Zebrios: First blood trade for wave control?  IDK, probably worth?
[0:10:44] hypxrbeam: itis defts year again with the ezreal buffs incoming
[0:10:49] jgeo_: Kinda fine for both sides? Wave wasn't awful
[0:10:53] Zebrios: IDK if he can get the minions into turret quick enough
[0:11:05] Joaz: @hypxrbeam its like 2-3 games LUL cant judge a crop on that
[0:11:13] awoogawooogawoo: is twitch ban in korea?
[0:11:13] HASTERIOUS: I guess Deft is really worried about the Varus & Renata ult
[0:11:27] eracelol: is hwei pick/ban atm?
[0:11:34] hypxrbeam: @Joaz what?
[0:11:46] Zebrios: This is just BDD being greedy
[0:11:56] Joaz: @hypxrbeam i just reacted to your last comment, the patch has been live just now
[0:12:08] Riqui__: Bloodthirsty supports FeelsStrongMan
[0:12:19] eracelol: lmao all it takes is a vpn?
[0:12:37] hypxrbeam: @Joaz in patch 14.2 ez is getting a bunch of ratio buffs on all his abilities im not sure what your implying
[0:12:50] HASTERIOUS: How is Fox going to stop Udyr? lol
[0:12:56] Zebrios: I thought there was some sort of discrepancy with Twitch being able to pay streams that were registered in Korea or something.
[0:12:58] chewtoy66: these tags are unexpected but not entierly false
[0:13:03] Joaz: @hypxrbeam the patch has not been pract on because riot is doodoo
[0:13:13] Joaz: @hypxrbeam they made it live after LEC went live
[0:13:22] BedBound: I'm shocked we haven't seen more Udyr top or jgl
[0:13:31] Zebrios: Beryl doing Beryl things
[0:13:39] PaddiV: ult  > AA xD
[0:13:45] meeechow: Pretty sure he kills if he just autos right?
[0:13:56] BedBound: Sry I meant for Lec
[0:13:57] J2easoN: whats good about udyr
[0:14:00] HASTERIOUS: T0M was in the wrong year.
[0:14:01] Zebrios: Udyr is perma pick/ban forever until he gets nerfed.  He's about as busted as Ksante is
[0:14:08] sejjy: udyr just full tank or ?
[0:14:11] Joaz: udyr is 100% pick ban in all games even if you havent seen them @MonteCristo
[0:14:15] Riqui__: KKona
[0:14:17] Joaz: in lck
[0:14:26] eracelol: it’s curious to me that they don’t build the AP bruiser items like liandries and riftmaker
[0:14:30] eracelol: on idyr
[0:15:03] HASTERIOUS: Udyr's ult does % damage no?
[0:15:10] Zebrios: Beryl died for basically no reason here.
[0:15:16] sejjy: beryl on hwei , mechanical god will carry KT to worlds!
[0:15:29] eracelol: I guess new udyr has different ratios
[0:15:30] Riqui__: w procs on auto
[0:15:31] Cipherflare: montecristo favorite team
[0:15:38] J2easoN: ohh thats jeonghoon LUL forgot about that

[0:15:45] eracelol: the best build on old udyr was runeglaive then full tank
[0:15:50] VXLTCasts: @HASTERIOUS the empowered version yes
[0:15:52] awoogawooogawoo: he rename to execute?
[0:15:53] eracelol: or runic echoes idk
[0:16:02] LKrambeck: it procs on auto
[0:16:12] Greenshaw: pretty sure its auto on champs
[0:16:24] Riqui__: His next basic attack or ability against the target detonates the mark to deal them bonus magic damage.
[0:16:40] Zebrios: Udyr casually farming at t2
[0:16:50] Nytrodark: @montecristo 2024 power spike episode when?????
[0:17:02] budgettaimou: crownie would have killed  him Kappa
[0:17:05] eracelol: pyosik back in kr pog
[0:17:07] HASTERIOUS: Fox doesn't really have an answer for the Udyr either
[0:17:11] HASTERIOUS: He's going to free farm all game
[0:17:12] VXLTCasts: yeah what I've seen is udyr actually the good version of singed now?
[0:17:57] eracelol: made up words yay
[0:17:58] LKrambeck: but singed is OP right now
[0:18:07] LKrambeck: on soloq hehe
[0:18:10] Zebrios: How long until Lehends plays Udyr support?
[0:18:22] HASTERIOUS: @MonteCristo We might get teemo in the LCK
[0:18:25] budgettaimou: caedrel on SI / some LFN show would be sick
[0:18:27] HASTERIOUS: Teemo seems BUSTED right now
[0:18:33] Zebrios: Void grubs seems incredibly strong.
[0:18:37] awoogawooogawoo: what is better 6 grubs or 2 drag?
[0:18:38] eracelol: @zebrios I wanna see the Elise supp with new AP items
[0:18:53] eracelol: brand jungle feels so good rn
[0:19:04] eracelol: one combo = one jg camp
[0:19:12] HASTERIOUS: Jungle brand is definitely insane though
[0:19:22] VXLTCasts: pyosik missed the Q KEK
[0:19:24] Zebrios: Xin too tanky
[0:19:43] eracelol: MAKING NA PROUD LUL
[0:19:52] lilGoobii: Do you think we could see nunu?
[0:20:10] HASTERIOUS: TRAITOR
[0:20:11] Zebrios: KT is gonna be KT
[0:20:16] Dabrens12: @lilGoobii If G2 swap in Keisha why not
[0:20:57] Cipherflare: hopefully we get Singed this year

[0:21:19] Tears_0f_sin: because people who drill holes are strong and beefy
[0:21:27] HASTERIOUS: Doesn't seem to make ense to me either lol
[0:21:28] Zebrios: Maybe they just wanted a Rek'sai theme item
[0:21:34] VXLTCasts: Any tool can become a weapon in the right hands.
[0:21:36] Gunloth: it identifies as a tunneler
[0:21:37] eracelol: I got a bean and cheese burrito on the way
[0:21:42] eracelol: I love california
[0:22:18] Zebrios: Absolute banger game.
[0:22:29] jgeo_: Got bored, flip herald
[0:22:31] Aconomo: Must be a reference to Armageddon.
[0:23:16] eracelol: pyosik GOD
[0:23:21] VXLTCasts: he's angry with the pit I assume
[0:23:22] Zebrios: Wait is this the game that Huni flamed the shit out of the Rumble play in the analysis? KEKW  I forget.
[0:23:22] eracelol: NA plot armor
[0:23:24] HASTERIOUS: That renata ult was absolutely disgusting lol
[0:23:39] jgeo_: The xin ult also doesn't do anything really
[0:23:53] Shimmerz: Monte how happy are you that beryl is back in the win column
[0:23:53] eracelol: how long until NA LCS games are fixed monte?
[0:24:26] Aoyos_: You can change sandbox into fearX but you will never make them forget about playing like sandbox
[0:24:38] Aconomo: Does Tunneler have flavor text so we can trace its origins?
[0:24:43] Dabrens12: @MonteCristo Main difference in your opinion why Udyr is almost pick or ban every game in LCK but not in LEC, would it evolve this week?
[0:24:45] eracelol: deft is like see ya feeders
[0:25:05] luxury_ball: omg its deft ezreal
[0:25:09] luxury_ball: I was missing that
[0:25:28] smithpw: Hello Monte and chat bluddWAVE
[0:25:34] Zebrios: I think fights over Void grubs are gonna be a lot more contested.  Letting any team get them all is a very very bad time.
[0:26:30] HASTERIOUS: It is whoever gets the last hit I think

[0:26:42] fljqpy: hwei LUL
[0:26:46] HASTERIOUS: In this case I think the dot lol
[0:26:51] MansoGanzo: the last source of damage was hwei ult, died before ezreal R hit
[0:26:55] zionsick: the passive triggered
[0:26:58] eracelol: SSN14
[0:27:04] eracelol: 200 years
[0:27:30] MansoGanzo: it didnt even hit otherwise there'd have been an assist
[0:27:33] Gunloth: he died because no tunneler
[0:27:35] Alsaphar: after renata w procs, damage doesnt determine who gets the kill
[0:27:38] chewtoy66: we must sacrifice visual clarity to sell skins of course
[0:27:45] zionsick: "Hwei marks enemy champions with his signature finishing touch by first damaging them with his abilities. Hitting an enemy with two damage-dealing spells places Hwei’s signature on the ground beneath them. The signature detonates after a short delay, dealing magic damage to all enemies in range."
[0:27:49] ajollymate: do you plan to cast for lck again in future?
[0:28:04] Zebrios: a Hwei/Aphelios lane feels like it would be absolute hell to play into.
[0:28:19] eracelol: Monte isn’t stupid
[0:28:29] HASTERIOUS: Do you think we'll see Qiyana in LPL or LCK?
[0:28:33] hypxrbeam: make less money work worse hours XD
[0:28:34] awoogawooogawoo: can you go live in lck studio?
[0:28:35] fljqpy: KT vs DK soon
[0:28:46] eracelol: jatt could actually have a big podcast if he didn’t get in the game so late
[0:28:49] eracelol: I s2g
[0:28:54] ajollymate: what's lfn?
[0:28:55] Aoyos_: But if you casted LCK for a day you could afford an order of tacos
[0:28:56] fljqpy: aiming vs deft
[0:29:19] MansoGanzo: OMEGALUL
[0:29:34] eracelol: agreed
[0:29:41] hypxrbeam: i love travis just catching random strays XD
[0:29:42] luxury_ball: but his friend gives him part of an alienware sponsorship :)
[0:29:46] eracelol: but I feel kind of sorry when they have to compete with u and thorin
[0:29:47] hibbjibb: @ajollymate lfn is love, lfn is life
[0:29:52] Duje275: No one can match to Travis Gaffords fellatio abilities
[0:29:53] zionsick: Do you think is because the volume of viewers or is it too niche?
[0:30:02] lilGoobii: Has rengar been played?
[0:30:06] Duje275: of suckin riot shlong
[0:30:13] AndrasMan01: Aftet this 1st week I feel we'll only see real meta changes when lpl starts
[0:30:20] Aoyos_: @eracelol there's enough for everyone if they're competent at what they do
[0:30:34] zionsick: Why is that Travis / others haven't figured out how to make money of podcasts
[0:30:54] Zebrios: I HATE when I see Renatas try to use ult as an engage tool.  Save that shit for when they try to counter-dive your ADC
[0:30:59] fljqpy: how can any meta changes happen with only 1 week into the season
[0:31:12] MansoGanzo: "SKILL ISSUE"
[0:31:17] awoogawooogawoo: When is monte and richwrath weeb podcast?
[0:31:18] zionsick: skill gap lol
[0:31:27] eracelol: @aoyos_ sure but personally, I only have so much bandwidth for lol content so I think there are conflicting interests
[0:31:42] eracelol: skill issue is real

[0:32:19] MansoGanzo: fox is the new bro? im lost
[0:32:20] Aoyos_: Psycho baron is the sandbox way
[0:32:27] Shimmerz: how many views do you need fourplay to sustain to consider it a success? I love it
[0:32:50] Zebrios: I think with Willer being chunked, KT should've gone baron there
[0:33:02] Duje275: Have you announced the next four play genre?
[0:33:08] eracelol: ya you guys started like less than 1 year ago right?
[0:33:18] lilGoobii: This game is definitely a banger but for alll the wrong reasons
[0:33:21] eracelol: culture channel is goated worthy investment
[0:33:22] hyptnoticgt: i watch it its great
[0:33:24] hibbjibb: I have the data. The culture channel is growing quite well
[0:33:24] chewtoy66: probably one of the more fun shows to do as well
[0:33:38] awoogawooogawoo: any plans for the weebs? AYAYA
[0:33:38] Shimmerz: fastest growing in flat views or % growth?
[0:33:40] lvlutedheretic: i don't think you want to "hammer away" during foreplay . . .
[0:33:49] hibbjibb: @troll754 Next four play is an anime movie
[0:33:52] MansoGanzo: @lvlutedheretic gachiGASM
[0:33:54] imainleesin: TL Pyosik
[0:33:54] ItzEnoz: huge potential for growth as well
[0:34:01] eracelol: I think it’s just an older audience it’s gotta be
[0:34:04] axelerator: nice
[0:34:06] awoogawooogawoo: @troll754 richard lewis would love this xdd
[0:34:08] Zebrios: Diversifying your brand is the surest way to insulate yourself from downturns in particular markets.
[0:34:28] Righteousjk: love the lfn content
[0:34:45] teddylear: @montecristo loving the league season/content coming back. Hope all is well with fam and new kid
[0:34:54] eracelol: came here to say the same lol @righteousjk
[0:35:19] ItzEnoz: this patch is a cluster fuck
[0:35:20] MansoGanzo: baby wanted to be there for 14.1
[0:35:25] eracelol: it’s cool though it’s still fresh
[0:35:35] Zebrios: This is the first League season that I'm genuinely excited to see played out with the changes to the map.  That's something that I think League has needed for a long time.
[0:35:36] AndrasMan01: With all the workload you have right now, the monte cooking streams are in a hiatus, right?
[0:35:44] awoogawooogawoo: when is hanwa plays?
[0:35:50] luxury_ball: did u watch any of the t1 challengers games?
[0:36:06] Tears_0f_sin: fox must be pretty good if they're playing this close vs the world champs kt has
[0:36:10] eracelol: cooking vids are suuuuper saturated no?
[0:36:12] hyptnoticgt: do you already know the results before doing banger only?
[0:36:17] eracelol: ur audience is literally everybody
[0:36:17] HASTERIOUS: The greatest content would be gordon ramsay reacting to your cooking streams.
[0:36:20] awoogawooogawoo: Any plans to do podcast live with LS?
[0:36:22] hibbjibb: @hyptnoticgt yes
[0:36:25] Zebrios: @MonteCristo You don't want to see Rekkles lose and cry in a different region?
[0:36:53] lilGoobii: next kid you gotta plan to have them in the off season xD

[0:37:35] smithpw: top tier stuff. I still have cooking books to read you recommend
[0:37:53] DilfZaddy: muk bangs galore
[0:37:53] Zebrios: FOX's map control is fucking abysmal.
[0:37:57] Duje275: Oh snap monte cooking arc is real
[0:38:14] axelerator: ooo what are some books I'm interested now @smithpw
[0:38:28] fljqpy: hwei gaming indeed
[0:38:31] Thewificrew: Would love some cooking streams. I need to start cooking for myself
[0:38:43] eracelol: ori/ezreal is brutal range and zone control
[0:38:46] fljqpy: just throw out skillshots all day
[0:38:55] Zebrios: "Let's retreat into mid lane and turn it into a shooting gallery for Ezreal and Hwei"
[0:39:08] AvariceTrades: is KT good or are they just beating on a bad team
[0:39:16] l0st3560: 🤦‍♂️
[0:39:27] hypxrbeam: they are so scared of dropping t2 for no reason its crazy
[0:39:33] eracelol: LMAOO
[0:39:34] luxury_ball: theyre not confident :(
[0:39:40] Shimmerz: I think the drx run where you had doa crumbs and wolf on your couch over the tourney was the most banger streams of the past few years
[0:40:01] luxury_ball: 50% hp ezreal is too scary
[0:40:02] hibbjibb: Just playing in the sandbox
[0:40:06] luxury_ball: if its deft playing it

[0:42:33] Askingformyself: c9 balls BibleThump
[0:42:34] addaberry: The famed "do nothing and lose" strat
[0:42:45] luxury_ball: @addaberry a classic of the LCK
[0:42:49] hypxrbeam: and xin is so strong on 2 core also and they are just wasting it
[0:42:50] hyptnoticgt: sauch a snoozfest
[0:42:55] pilotjunkie: Is Fox a new team?
[0:43:00] axelerator: I'll never tire of seeing Deft play Pulsefire Ez
[0:43:03] fljqpy: ResidentSleeper
[0:43:04] Askingformyself: are we excited for KT?
[0:43:06] hibbjibb: @pilotjunkie They used to be liiv sandbox
[0:43:19] Aoyos_: Best team sandbox
[0:43:19] Shimmerz: monte what do you make of rumble items, they gave huni and aneurism
[0:43:29] fljqpy: what the FUKC
[0:43:30] hyptnoticgt: naaaah lmao
[0:43:31] Shimmerz: liandries second
[0:43:38] Aoyos_: Yeah 50-50 baron is the sandbox way
[0:43:42] eracelol: omgggg KT!!!!
[0:43:42] Zebrios: Perfect literally god mode.
[0:43:47] Gh0stStyle: F OMEGALUL X
[0:43:51] imainleesin: nice to see Pyosik smurfing
[0:43:56] Zebrios: Sun dicks
[0:44:03] AvariceTrades: Did KT solve their problem by building a team that is hard to be excited for?
[0:44:30] TheTraderKing: Iron Chef Beryl Pog
[0:44:33] Zebrios: KT isn't winning.  FOX is losing.
[0:44:37] LuxtheGod: fox engage is shit
[0:44:41] Aoyos_: FOX is a bottom table team
[0:44:47] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: just got here, have i missed any bangers today?
[0:44:49] hyptnoticgt: where is the O in FOX coming from exactly?
[0:44:50] Zebrios: This is like Stormtroopers vs Red Shirts.
[0:45:12] Zebrios: Clozer completely whiffed ult
[0:45:15] Shimmerz: their only cc is varus ult
[0:45:32] fljqpy: LUL
[0:45:39] Aoyos_: Clear doesn't even have rumble ult
[0:45:40] A_LINK_IN_TIME: LUL
[0:45:52] Zebrios: Clozer though LUL
[0:45:57] Zebrios: Whiffing azir ult
[0:46:30] fljqpy: ???
[0:46:38] Aoyos_: In the replay it's on cd
[0:46:39] TheTraderKing: didnt find an opportunity KEKW
[0:46:50] Aoyos_: So might be spectator bug
[0:46:52] Askingformyself: nice ult
[0:46:54] luxury_ball: the unseen rumbled R is the scariest

[0:46:57] Zebrios: That's Hwei
[0:47:04] Aoyos_: That's Hwei
[0:47:14] Aoyos_: Issue is when they go to the replay Rumble ult is on cd
[0:47:15] hypxrbeam: i would report clear if this was a solo queue game
[0:47:24] TheTraderKing: he should have just dropped it on deft and ran at him
[0:47:29] Aoyos_: So gotta say it's spectator bug
[0:47:37] Shimmerz: this is the hero
[0:47:43] Aoyos_: He used ult randomly
[0:47:58] Zebrios: The second Deft E'd forward, you just ult him and he's dead or out of the fight.
[0:48:08] Aoyos_: During the replay before the baron he used it probably
[0:48:10] lazink: Do they still ban certain skins in pro play?
[0:48:30] fljqpy: yea dont trust the replay
[0:48:39] Duje275: love riot cooldowns
[0:48:42] jgeo_: Yeah
[0:48:42] Tears_0f_sin: i don't htink it's a bug i jus thitnk he never uses it
[0:49:15] meeechow: Yeah he doesn't use ult the whole time, could have ulted Deft or anyone else and did something
[0:49:23] hypxrbeam: he could even just drop it ontop of willer and azir and protect them from the lee reengage
[0:49:31] fljqpy: tfw u gotta go sherlock holmes on these replays to investigate whether an ult was used LUL
[0:49:59] Jeffp2662: should have just laid it down in front of lee sin
[0:50:03] Aoyos_: It's also the perfect baron for rumble ults
[0:50:07] Zebrios: Clozer's ult is LUL-worthy
[0:50:09] Aoyos_: With the corridors
[0:50:12] AndrasMan01: He's badly positioned for a good ult anyway
[0:50:26] AvariceTrades: This baron pit entrance looks built for rumble as well
[0:50:52] luxury_ball: @Zebrios it was kinda ok
[0:50:58] Aoyos_: Don't worry, FearX is here to stay
[0:51:33] LuxtheGod: i dont see what else fear can do besides start an objective, they have no poke and no real engage
[0:51:38] luxury_ball: idk good look from clozer
[0:51:47] luxury_ball: but its a hard angle
[0:52:12] fljqpy: lck and lec also needs to scale down to 8 teams LUL
[0:52:12] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:52:23] Aoyos_: @LuxtheGod With the low cd on rumble and varus ult they could just force KT to come into range and run out after unloading a rotation then wait for cds again
[0:52:25] Zebrios: KT's skirmishing is too strong to break the fight up.  They're just getting picked apart being indecisive.
[0:52:43] Aoyos_: They have 4 ults that completely block off the Baron corridors
[0:53:09] Komarimasita: the only thing making this game palatable is you monte!! keep doing you
[0:53:13] Zebrios: Renata ult LUL
[0:53:18] Askingformyself: balls play a good rumble tbh
[0:53:36] fljqpy: ????
[0:53:44] Tears_0f_sin: it's impressive that you can miss EVERY1  in the jungle
[0:53:49] Tears_0f_sin: honestly that's harder than hitting a 5 man ult
[0:53:52] MoldyCalzone: My eyes
[0:53:54] masaya4: lmao
[0:53:59] TheTraderKing: oh there is an even better one next game LUL
[0:54:10] Aoyos_: Monte you're not ready for a season with FearX
[0:54:14] fljqpy: this has to be a challenger team
[0:54:19] Aoyos_: Sandbox was better and that's saying something
[0:54:20] Askingformyself: I’m excited for a 1-0 start
[0:54:28] Komarimasita: bdd doesnt deserve this tbh
[0:54:36] Zebrios: Huni does.  Trust me.
[0:54:38] Jeffp2662: not sure that one qualifies as a "banger"
[0:54:43] Juudailol: he does
[0:54:51] imainleesin: it must be hot in there
[0:54:55] Mr_Something__: LUL THAT'S OUR BOY
[0:54:56] Im_Rubic: LUL
[0:54:56] MoldyCalzone: KEKW
[0:54:56] fljqpy: LUL
[0:55:11] hyptnoticgt: LuL
[0:55:12] jgeo_: Thank you
[0:55:14] luxury_ball: huni cooking
[0:55:19] hyptnoticgt: huni is right
[0:55:21] Aoyos_: Riftmaker is so weird though
[0:55:41] luxury_ball: Stats say its better than void on every champ in every build order
[0:55:46] fljqpy: NEGATIVE
[0:55:48] death_kain: huni a real one
[0:55:51] hyptnoticgt: negative based
[0:55:55] Aoyos_: Riftmaker Swifties
[0:56:06] vedana9: lol
[0:56:06] tlo_chaos: id say that the heal makes it worth more than void
[0:56:11] hyptnoticgt: he trolled his build so hard è
[0:56:14] death_kain: he couldnt have been more wrong lol
[0:56:19] zionsick: lmao Huni is destroying him
[0:56:23] AndrasMan01: How is the new item good? I think it has bad numbers and cd to be good
[0:56:28] zionsick: Huhi** ffs
[0:56:31] epicalbawler: that was an ult of all time
[0:56:39] AndrasMan01: The item passive
[0:56:39] Aoyos_: @AndrasMan01 What new item
[0:56:45] zionsick: or Huni wtf
[0:56:57] zionsick: Sorry, my brain is a mush
[0:57:02] AndrasMan01: Cryptbloom or wtv it is called

[0:57:34] Aoyos_: @AndrasMan01 It's slightly cheaper than void staff, only -10AP -10% magic pen and the heals on kill can completely change a fight
[0:58:09] Birbmang_: So you're telling me pyosik has a job but Tarzan doesn't
[0:58:11] Mr_Something__: Yeah the heal is for team too, no? Can completely warp a fight
[0:58:28] AndrasMan01: Heal seems kinda meh and with a high cd, might be undervaluing it, ty
[0:58:53] SiIentShadows: correct
[0:58:57] Aoyos_: Even without the heal Cryptbloom is already more valuable than Void Staff unless you really need the extra 10% magic pen
[0:59:01] noyea96: yes, 200g cheaper
[0:59:06] Aoyos_: Because it has 15 ability haste
[0:59:07] fljqpy: u do plenty of dmg already u dont need the extra power of void staff
[0:59:10] SiIentShadows: losign 10% magic pen is a lot though
[0:59:20] fljqpy: HWEI twink Kreygasm
[0:59:26] Zebrios: He's an "artist" Monte.
[0:59:27] fljqpy: he has a choker too
[0:59:33] Birbmang_: because lol is a Chineese mobile game now
[0:59:51] luxury_ball: @AndrasMan01 yea winrates suggest its simply better in every scenario
[1:00:02] commando1814: hwei would 100% be a pop punk idol from 2002
[1:00:23] hero_1_ap: I miss the rollercoaster logo
[1:00:25] Aoyos_: @commando1814 It's literally kpop boyband from any year
[1:00:44] biggerbeefey: Udyr is meta now?
[1:00:55] Aoyos_: Udyr is very strong
[1:00:57] Zebrios: Udyr is super meta
[1:00:59] hypxrbeam: I think noc will go up in prio when it goes to 14.1.5 with the hexplate buff
[1:01:22] fljqpy: that hwei neck and nape
[1:01:24] fljqpy: Kreygasm
[1:01:30] commando1814: will the 14.2 ap changes change udy
[1:01:35] Komarimasita: at least this guys not on rumble again my god
[1:01:48] Aoyos_: @MonteCristo After that game 1 how do you feel knowing good old Ryu is the head coach of FearX
[1:01:52] Zebrios: @Komarimasita They threatened him with jail time.
[1:01:55] Birbmang_: oh but he can
[1:01:57] tlo_chaos: idk autos are hard
[1:01:58] Komarimasita: hahaha
[1:02:03] Zebrios: Challenge accepted, Monte
[1:02:03] Komarimasita: SURELY udyr is simple enough
[1:02:25] commando1814: we will have to wait for lcs to watch really shot udy top lane
[1:02:30] tlo_chaos: did he just ghost to lane @MonteCristo
[1:02:37] addaberry: Fun to imagine if Jojo had ended up in FearX jail after all
[1:02:37] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:02:42] biggerbeefey: Really hope a Brazilian team wins worlds and pick Hwei for their skin
[1:03:06] fljqpy: no chance in hell
[1:03:08] luxury_ball: what if the head coach castrated the whole team and thats why they cant engage ever
[1:03:20] Dzy3D: what is the thought process behind the hwei pick?
[1:03:25] Birbmang_: don't look at the minimap xin is not pathing top whatsoever
[1:03:26] Birbmang_: it will be fine
[1:03:37] Zebrios: I'm pretty sure Perfect solo kills him in lane.
[1:04:21] Mr_Something__: @Dzy3D It's Beryl, so there are only two options: 1.) There is no thought process. 2.) He has transcended our mortal plane and thus we will never be able to comprehend the thought process.
[1:04:24] HASTERIOUS: It's like leaving a guy wide open from the 3 in the NBA lol
[1:04:28] HASTERIOUS: The disrespect
[1:04:31] tlo_chaos: that draven e into stun was nice
[1:04:48] NiuenSaien: nicks fan "clear is a fuckin bumb"
[1:05:01] Dzy3D: @Mr_Something__ makes sense
[1:05:14] Aoyos_: It's the typical situation of soloq players turned pros, completely lost after laning
[1:05:26] HASTERIOUS: Sounds like your typical /r/nba reddit user about their NBA rookies
[1:05:27] Zebrios: Oh he's gonna do SOMETHING
[1:05:30] HASTERIOUS: Except Wembenyama.
[1:05:34] commando1814: that's what nfl fans do ! 1 game overreacting baby !!!
[1:05:50] biggerbeefey: If Looper can make a career off being a bum so can this guy
[1:05:51] fljqpy: hwei has 10 abilities
[1:05:58] Zebrios: Hwei provides a lot of wave clear.
[1:06:02] Aoyos_: Hwei serves a more offensive Karma pick
[1:06:06] SiIentShadows: its a strong lane bully and utility CC champ
[1:06:19] commando1814: @hasterious clearly Desmond ridder is the best qb cause he beat Jordon love
[1:06:22] commando1814: the bum
[1:06:45] SiIentShadows: taliyah was on a ward LUL
[1:06:55] luxury_ball: bdd gachiGASM

[1:10:06] fljqpy: u dont really need hands when u have 10 abilities
[1:10:06] grandezelx: beryl
[1:10:09] Mr_Something__: KT finally figured out how to win worlds; if they sign Beryl, they KNOW Monte won't ever be excited about him. 5Head
[1:10:11] fljqpy: just throw them out
[1:10:13] Aoyos_: That's the beauty of Hwei, you just need one working hand
[1:10:23] Fire_elemen6: the way you talk about BeryL is the same way Yiska talks about Kariv
[1:10:43] anomalous_autumn: wowowow

[1:11:08] Fissiccisst: who's plan? dont know
[1:11:10] SiIentShadows: if he doesnt know what he is doing they dont know what he is doing
[1:11:19] fljqpy: just throw skills out, u have infinite mana
[1:11:49] Mr_Something__: $10 says Beryl first timed Hwei in unranked half an hour before game 1
[1:11:53] Aoyos_: BDD already helped get a kill, he's done more than a bum
[1:11:53] jimbo002y: its ok, kallista ksante will carry EZ
[1:12:04] luxury_ball: it was so funny when NA did that
[1:12:12] luxury_ball: and sheiden said "rumble has cancer"
[1:12:19] zen__cloud: do you think hwei is better in support role?
[1:12:30] Zebrios: LCK production is 11/10

[1:13:07] axelerator: I don't mind unhinged Monte
[1:13:21] Komarimasita: that would add more tbh
[1:13:35] Aoyos_: Sponsored by beer and insurance companies, clearly stuff not aimed at kids
[1:13:42] commando1814: I don't give a flying fuck . but I can't think of any other way other than talent or knowledge
[1:13:46] anomalous_autumn: they prob on windowed because they are on 1440p 240hrz 27inch OLEDs now

[1:24:09] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo in a bof5 do you pick Gen.G to beat T1 right now?
[1:24:17] GPAlexander: just ksante things
[1:24:36] Zebrios: It feels like T1 is feeling out the meta
[1:24:59] Giiino: shooting renata ult backwards by accident wouldve been better than that
[1:25:06] Aoyos_: Lehends just ran them over, until he ran it down
[1:25:16] Zebrios: GenG is always good domestically.  They just can't ever get it together for international.
[1:25:20] BUBBLESHINOBI: also their champ pool seemed like they cant play anything that wasnt good last season
[1:25:37] SiIentShadows: it would be so funny if canyon is just tank duty entire season
[1:25:40] Loxi9: @bubbleshinobi didnt chovy pick cork8
[1:25:41] jimbo002y: Aware
[1:25:42] Loxi9: corki*

[1:26:05] Zebrios: Execute sleeper agent
[1:26:09] t3lawrence: thinks its a engage spell or what
[1:26:10] Aoyos_: But the spread on FOX losing would be awful returns
[1:26:12] BUBBLESHINOBI: @Loxi9 corki at this point is a legacy hit of every mid
[1:26:13] DoobsMcgoo: straight agent
[1:26:24] nalganeitor: that was just shameful...
[1:26:26] SiIentShadows: i think we need to put him on leona or something

[1:26:44] wiMc13: Clozer in Jail as always BabyRage
[1:26:46] Aoyos_: They're worse than Sandbox, kept the entertainment though
[1:26:46] SiIentShadows: actually put him on naut so he cant miss ult
[1:26:47] Birbmang_: but are they the worst of the very bad teams
[1:26:47] jimbo002y: its clozer elohell as usual
[1:26:51] Fire_elemen6: maybe KT is just very elite Kappa
[1:26:58] Zebrios: If FOX finishes above 8th it'll be because something went very very wrong in the league
[1:27:05] DoobsMcgoo: y does it say fox thp who is this team
[1:27:34] Loxi9: @doobsmcgoo sandbox rebrand

[1:29:32] imainleesin: could IMT beat FOX?
[1:29:48] Zebrios: Clear things he's a god
[1:29:52] Zebrios: thinks*
[1:29:59] luxury_ball: he didnt get the memo that enemy team was there
[1:30:04] t3lawrence: dude throwing games first week into lck or what
[1:30:07] Aoyos_: Did you ever think Clear would of had a better game on Rumble than on Udyr
[1:30:08] luxury_ball: the rest of his team kept it a secret
[1:30:20] Birbmang_: what a dogshit series
[1:30:33] tlo_chaos: that was one of series of all time
[1:31:01] nalganeitor: i am on time for this serie, awesome
[1:31:07] BUBBLESHINOBI: How did Kellin get on this roster again

[1:31:28] Birbmang_: it's ok*
[1:31:36] luxury_ball: poby games were actually better
[1:31:39] Zebrios: I'd rather watch ROX vs SKT again.
[1:31:46] Riqui__: Kellin goat
[1:31:57] sennah21: All roads lead to Beryl Kappa
[1:32:27] Fire_elemen6: in aiming we trust
[1:32:34] BUBBLESHINOBI: maybe kellin wanted to play rakan cuz milio kinda counters rakan
[1:32:47] t3lawrence: doesnt seem like it went how they envisioned
[1:32:59] Birbmang_: but can effort and envy abuse anyone really
[1:32:59] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:33:15] Aoyos_: @Birbmang_ Themselves
[1:33:35] Oraclon: im just glad lucian disappeared, that pick looked so sus
[1:33:45] Loxi9: i think lucid wanted to play vi? so they had to take xayah rakan maybe
[1:33:56] Birbmang_: but dude he was on skt :^)
[1:33:59] Oscar_Pod: honestly think it was just disrespect
[1:34:25] Aoyos_: Whoa you can't just crown Effort like that, Execute is coming for the title
[1:34:39] Fire_elemen6: trust Monte, Aiming is a master chef
[1:34:47] Oscar_Pod: as long as they got their rakan xayah they were confident they could beat anything except lucian milio. but i dont agree with it, i think they should just try to get renata or milio themselves
[1:34:58] zoramura: @Oraclon wait until LCS if you even make yourself suffer through that elisLUL
[1:35:04] Loxi9: its hard to play vi into xayah rakan
[1:35:10] fljqpy: dk vs kt soon
[1:35:10] Birbmang_: is this the game he gets the penta
[1:35:36] suav0115: do you know the results of the games?
[1:36:00] Zebrios: This is the Aiming show for these 2 games I think
[1:36:02] Aoyos_: I'm excited for the dudu show in some hours
[1:36:03] Oraclon: @zoramura hahaha i dont think so, maybe a few games after we see what teams tend to be at the top. was hard to watch lec even ^^
[1:36:09] wiMc13: to review
[1:36:27] MissingMatter: We can be surprised by the plays rather than the results.
[1:36:28] lachlantom: LUL
[1:36:35] wiMc13: monke 🐒
[1:36:42] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo Did you watch any of the demacia cup games?
[1:36:44] MissingMatter: One day one of us will figure out what a rookern is.
[1:36:44] lachlantom: monke 🐒

[1:39:01] luxury_ball: dawncore is kinda cool
[1:39:02] SiIentShadows: users
[1:39:03] Birbmang_: chat gpt names
[1:39:03] fljqpy: opportunity? hubris?
[1:39:13] Tameimpala2: Maligma LUL
[1:39:13] MissingMatter: Dawncore is what you have left over when you have an apple for breakfast.
[1:39:14] SiIentShadows: dude HUBRIS
[1:39:14] zoramura: Zaza's realm spike elisOmega
[1:39:24] Fire_elemen6: they put the realm in a gom jabar
[1:39:26] wiMc13: LUL
[1:39:34] Loxi9: its a valorant reference they're planting the spikes on the realm
[1:39:36] wiMc13: maybe it's a volleyball spike not drink spiking
[1:39:38] Mr_Something__: Don't forget "Twirly Whirly Sword."
[1:39:38] Loxi9: 4Head
[1:39:42] Dzy3D: dawncore is good, raba for supps
[1:39:42] storeole: they probably have some random name generator
[1:39:47] Komarimasita: its the ZaZa
[1:39:50] BUBBLESHINOBI: someone was on the zaza when they wrote zaz'zak as a name
[1:40:02] Aoyos_: @BUBBLESHINOBI Seraphine and Yuumi would benefit a lot
[1:40:08] Birbmang_: i never understand why people don't flash the thing that will kill them but instead flash when they are low
[1:40:17] ruiva: imagine making it to adulthood and never having your realm spiked
[1:40:18] Aoyos_: Specially Yuumi cuz it gives summoner spell haste
[1:40:29] SiIentShadows: idk how BRO managed to downgrade their botlane from Hena
[1:40:31] Aoyos_: So she can pop ignite, exhaust, etc way more often
[1:40:38] zoramura: Birbmang_ bc ppl greed flash and think they don't need to flash some stuff
[1:40:51] luxury_ball: I feel so weird after that play from envyyy. He flashed rakan W but forgot about xayah feathers
[1:40:53] Loxi9: aiming could save rakan if he flashed backwards as he e'd
[1:41:04] Birbmang_: @zoramura meanwhile in lpl they flash an ability lvl 2 just to save hp
[1:41:16] Aoyos_: @Birbmang_ It's cooldown greed, it's also why they don't readily pop ults to force reactions
[1:41:19] BigMightyena: LUL
[1:41:21] Oraclon: i love that chovy showed that corki azir is back on the menu, i missed that matchup Kappa
[1:41:23] fljqpy: opposite the lee
[1:41:24] MissingMatter: He's doing his best to keep up with Riot item naming team.
[1:41:27] BUBBLESHINOBI: @Aoyos_ yuumi makes sense seraphine seems kinda whatever with it
[1:41:34] wiMc13: Wolf coining words LUL
[1:41:48] SiIentShadows: if Riot can do it he can do it
[1:41:49] Mr_Something__: BREAKING: Wolf chosen to name next League item after executives hear his recent LCK cast.
[1:41:52] biggerbeefey: dont make him realm spike you
[1:42:00] Aoyos_: @BUBBLESHINOBI It's worse on seraphine for sure but the key is the summoner spell haste, that can help a lot
[1:42:21] Aoyos_: Stack that with cdr boots
[1:42:29] Karego: lol
[1:42:37] fljqpy: but there needs to be a name of some dude
[1:42:41] SiIentShadows: LUL
[1:42:42] BUBBLESHINOBI: @Aoyos_ yeah problem with her is the W cd is too big so she cant abuse the shield power of the item
[1:42:49] Aoyos_: Oh I agree
[1:42:49] fljqpy: its not just rageblade its guinsoo's
[1:42:50] Combusttion: i think that mr item is fine, its build path and stats are just wack, the effect is good
[1:42:55] MissingMatter: Promoting the hubris monkey will cause him to get too full of himself and end up failing disastrously.
[1:42:58] Demokritos: rookern sounds like an estoteric old English word
[1:42:58] MissingMatter: It is known.
[1:43:04] Loxi9: what do u think of souls, feels like all of them are pretty decent for the first time since their release
[1:43:07] Aoyos_: @BUBBLESHINOBI But having summoner spells wayyyy more often can be super useful in some games
[1:43:16] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo how about the Voltaic Cyclosword? That is some invention of words right there
[1:43:19] Mr_Something__: Lucid about to be VAC banned for that pathing
[1:43:21] SiIentShadows: Hubris is basically sword of occult
[1:43:30] Esterifikace: Alloo vicksyWave
[1:43:31] Aoyos_: They saw the ward
[1:43:34] Aoyos_: Not him
[1:43:40] Esterifikace: so are you hyped for KT yet? vicksySip
[1:43:58] Karego: Are we certain it's not Phreak?

[1:43:59] fljqpy: like a sword on a wheel
[1:44:06] MissingMatter: It's a sword that has a guy on it pedaling to make it spin. Duh.
[1:44:09] Tameimpala2: wait vigilant wardstone is still in the game? KEKW
[1:44:11] zoramura: a sword you ride like a bike
[1:44:12] wiMc13: sword like a cyclone?
[1:44:14] lachlantom: sword only used by cyclops
[1:44:15] zionsick: Lethal Bunchofwords
[1:44:16] luxury_ball: I would forgive it if it sounded cool
[1:44:17] Fissiccisst: Clearly its a sword, that agitates your laundry
[1:44:18] fljqpy: yep
[1:44:19] wiMc13: sword spinning?
[1:44:22] Mr_Something__: @MissingMatter this is canon now
[1:44:22] kanchuuuu: cyclone sword
[1:44:26] SiIentShadows: circle sword Kappa
[1:44:33] Tameimpala2: Cyclone + Sword = Cyclosword
[1:44:34] MissingMatter: But it has a battery, thus voltaic.
[1:44:39] Oraclon: cyclosword is what the chainsaw was called before...
[1:44:48] MissingMatter: So it's kind of like a sword moped.
[1:44:57] Zebrios: Chainsword is a 40k weapon
[1:45:07] Zebrios: We know what those do
[1:45:10] Loxi9: voltaic cyclosword sounds like some thing bad dragon or adam and eve would sell...
[1:45:12] fljqpy: yea when u attach swords to ur bicycle
[1:45:24] MissingMatter: Maybe Swain is a rookern.
[1:45:26] Giiino: riot bought a thesaurus this year and theyre gunna fully utilize it
[1:45:26] Oraclon: man imma ask noam chomsky if these names make any sense
[1:45:38] Zebrios: Well, a rook is something
[1:45:46] fljqpy: a rook's lantern
[1:45:56] Birbmang_: riot will burn for this
[1:45:57] tlo_chaos: breaking it down, it would be something with lightning and wind, but how many "storm" items would we have if they did that
[1:46:01] Demokritos: rooker is a middle English word, coming from rokke
[1:46:03] Tameimpala2: rook (from chess) + urn = ?
[1:46:05] SiIentShadows: n development this item was formally referred to as Magic Rock by Riot's game designers
[1:46:17] Moggrath: it’s an in-world machine I guess?
[1:46:19] SiIentShadows: ut went from magic rock to kaenic rookern
[1:46:22] LSDMTG: LSDMTG subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:46:23] zoramura: You don't have a rookern in your home on your dining table?
[1:46:24] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo How about names that make 0 sense about what the item does for example Unending Despair on a tank item that deals magic dmg around you
[1:46:38] MissingMatter: I'll bet that's some sort of rock that has magical properties.
[1:46:40] dbird901: what do you think of the void bugs so far? Think prioritizing all 6 over first drag and maybe second drag is worth?
[1:46:43] wiMc13: LUL
[1:46:44] LSDMTG: lsd is my name
[1:46:48] LSDMTG: initials
[1:46:52] LSDMTG: and i was a pro mtg player for a while
[1:46:54] zoramura: sure Kappa
[1:46:55] storeole: the best way to play mtg for sure
[1:46:57] Komarimasita: i feel like monte is gonna wake up in the middle of the night screaming WHAT IS A RUKERN
[1:46:57] eck1e: the name is either an insane linguistic deep cut or complete nonsense
[1:46:58] TheFistification: lsd is their name, mtg is their game
[1:46:59] wiMc13: nice initials
[1:47:05] fljqpy: so he WAS hallucinating
[1:47:07] LSDMTG: a great gift my father gave me
[1:47:09] Tameimpala2: why is the item Terminus sound like a train station LUL
[1:47:23] wiMc13: LMAO
[1:47:29] Karego: @TheFistification That was great
[1:47:30] kaarataka: 5Head

[1:47:34] LSDMTG: ahah
[1:47:39] LSDMTG: i do use it socially all the time
[1:47:41] Loxi9: what 2 kids does to a guy's humor
[1:48:00] Tameimpala2: are you lsd? cause you are a banned substance in my country EZ
[1:48:02] LSDMTG: very useful to entertain dummies
[1:48:09] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo Did we ever figure out who Luden's is and why does he have a Tempest and Ecco and a Companion now
[1:48:13] zoramura: @TheFistification that's a good one
[1:48:20] wiMc13: Labrynth, Sia, Diplo Kreygasm
[1:48:22] Askingformyself: swallow the full dose? Kappa
[1:48:56] LSDMTG: in any case i've been following you since S5 LCK and you're the main reason while i'm still following league to this day , not buying the hype and actually focusing on the great plays as a pro player always struck me as a great trait, thanks for all entertainment
[1:48:58] wolfguy: so was BRO early game just all Umti?

[1:49:10] MissingMatter: @BUBBLESHINOBI I think Luden's is a cough drop maker.
[1:49:14] Aoyos_: I'm pretty sure if Jax went Rookern no one can lane against him
[1:49:19] MissingMatter: I'm not sure why they're so involved in LoL though.
[1:49:28] LSDMTG: @Tameimpala2 isnt it banned everywhere
[1:49:31] wiMc13: UmTi is now the reason to watch Liquid? Kapp
[1:49:31] SiIentShadows: @wolfguy yes, Morgan did a interview and said that its hard to macro without Umti
[1:49:40] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MissingMatter secret sponsor of riot games I guess
[1:49:41] LegisLucis: I realized I stopped being a Brion fan when umti left
[1:49:47] luxury_ball: didnt he go to TL this off season?
[1:50:00] Loxi9: what kind of player is umti? lost interest in his career after his debut on kt
[1:50:03] zoramura: Too bad C9 didn't get Wunder
[1:50:07] Tameimpala2: Runegorger is a sick name tho
[1:50:10] Aoyos_: Umti is so hype
[1:50:15] wiMc13: Core is so overrated

[1:50:25] fljqpy: every year he gets a new lck jungler LUL
[1:50:40] Oraclon: @luxury_ball BASED
[1:51:09] Aoyos_: Core is just trying to make his own koreatown
[1:51:13] fljqpy: why couldnt he hypnotize pyosik better
[1:51:19] ogoaxe: KappaPride
[1:51:27] storeole: exc++use me, he does what?
[1:51:27] Tameimpala2: Vampires actually sparkle like diamonds when they are in the sunlight Kappa
[1:51:28] Askingformyself: suck them all dry
[1:51:29] Oraclon: omg, get that pictoure out of my head please
[1:51:29] zoramura: Pyosik's blood was already rotten elisOmega
[1:51:31] LSDMTG: poor core :(
[1:51:35] LSDMTG: the heart and soul of NA
[1:51:35] t3lawrence: kr blood is for the patricians taste
[1:51:36] BUBBLESHINOBI: invites them to a kbbq and tells them how much better kbbq in LA is and they get curious and have to try out
[1:51:39] Zebrios: Monte is cranking out lore like crazy
[1:51:39] wiMc13: Core's thirsty 🧛‍♂️
[1:51:47] luxury_ball: his vampire arc started when he fell victim to the american skill vampires
[1:51:50] Esterifikace: its fine, he can be saved by blood transfusion
[1:51:54] luxury_ball: its a form of resistance
[1:52:00] Fire_elemen6: so Core is Catherine Deneuve?
[1:52:04] anomalous_autumn: Lucid is clean
[1:52:08] LSDMTG: are you still in korea @MonteCristo
[1:52:12] Loxi9: clean from lucid
[1:52:16] eck1e: i do wonder if any teams are going to bring out singed on this patch, he is really good into alot of the "default" toplaners such as jax/aatrox
[1:52:30] Oraclon: karis using his ult as a fan to blow some air, must be hot on stage..
[1:52:46] SiIentShadows: like gideon is good but its horrible to lose umti in this team PepeHands
[1:52:55] Loxi9: can u play solo q in korea?
[1:53:04] LSDMTG: whats "zaddy"
[1:53:28] storeole: @MonteCristo whats your opinion on raising kids in korea vs us?
[1:53:30] Aoyos_: Yeah but as long as the Jax doesn't build tank items he still gets blown up
[1:53:37] najafan: Zaddy = Monte.
[1:53:39] najafan: Duh
[1:53:46] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo btw I couldnt catch the t1 vs geng thing. What did you think of the game 3? I thought it was one of the most LCK games in recent years
[1:53:49] addaberry: Plutomic Zaddy
[1:53:52] fljqpy: hes getting 6 grubs
[1:53:57] Askingformyself: I know what daddy is, but what’s zaddy?
[1:54:03] Firewalkerz: Rookern sounds like hookers
[1:54:04] zoramura: They definitely use GPT to generate these item names
[1:54:13] MissingMatter: Zaddy is what Kaernic called his dad when he was just a little rookerino.

[1:54:18] eck1e: did they ever patch the titanic + sundered sky bug?
[1:54:47] najafan: @MissingMatter Only while he was in Ohio while thinking of that gyatt.
[1:55:01] Aoyos_: Does that mean Execute is the new crowned worst support in LCK
[1:55:14] fljqpy: it was unluck
[1:55:25] wiMc13: Canyon can't secure objectives LUL
[1:55:56] fljqpy: do not besmirch canyon
[1:57:08] zoramura: what do you think about the global red and blue buffs?
[1:57:51] Naxser: @MonteCristo Without peanut they didn't do the gold thing that they normally do, they played the game very differently and T1 looks like they still were recovering from after their short vacations
[1:57:57] Aoyos_: It also changes sidelaning completely during the red buff duration
[1:58:02] najafan: Do you think the compensatory Ivern buffs are sufficient?
[1:58:34] fistigons25: just joined. what do you think about KT? did you get excited with Beryl’s Hwei gaming? 😂
[1:58:39] eck1e: global blue is really nice for lucian bot since he would go essence reaver (sometimes) before to negate mana issues, but now he gets to go other higher potential dps items and still faceroll
[1:58:43] Oraclon: was fun to see T1 try out some stuff, like double supp item or belveth
[1:58:53] fljqpy: hella excited for hwei
[1:59:03] fljqpy: that neck
[1:59:12] feldiddi: global bluebuff is pretty good for ezreal and jinx who wouldnt normally get one
[1:59:14] LSDMTG: thoughts on the new seasons o far?

[1:59:22] Aoyos_: No smites
[1:59:27] BUBBLESHINOBI: envy gideon anti synergy
[1:59:28] fljqpy: just xayah things
[1:59:31] Birbmang_: lads can someone recommend me a fun bad movie
[1:59:31] Fire_elemen6: because Aiming is a master chef
[1:59:36] BUBBLESHINOBI: kalista used E but lee didnt use smite
[2:00:19] jooshboxes: pain
[2:00:24] luxury_ball: so kalista couldve just smited at 1600 :D
[2:00:26] Loxi9: @birbmang_ moonfall
[2:00:47] BUBBLESHINOBI: they got impatient
[2:01:19] Aoyos_: Same reason Morgan is still on that side of the wall
[2:01:21] Karego: That would require forethought
[2:01:21] fljqpy: gotta save it
[2:01:27] Oraclon: yeah that would have been safer probably
[2:01:28] BUBBLESHINOBI: he didnt wanna make the effort
[2:01:41] Birbmang_: @Loxi9 oh this looks terrible i'm into it
[2:01:42] kud0slol: @BUBBLESHINOBI good one
[2:01:43] Oraclon: only if you hit the enemy jgl with renata R
[2:02:54] Oraclon: lee didnt even smite btw
[2:02:58] BUBBLESHINOBI: baby steps monte they need to learn to do them one by one
[2:03:27] Birbmang_: bro so bad not even lord morgan is good enough to carry
[2:03:43] BUBBLESHINOBI: he didnt have flash
[2:03:49] BUBBLESHINOBI: one or the other is bugged
[2:03:51] Protomango: I bet channel points on BRO this game because it was 10x odds, then this happened
[2:04:29] Birbmang_: i wouldn't put a rotten cent on bro to win any game ever

[2:04:40] Aoyos_: @Birbmang_ They beat FOX
[2:04:53] Birbmang_: good for them but that's still not a good idea to bet on
[2:06:19] luxury_ball: most skilled pentakill
[2:06:42] Birbmang_: most skilled pentakill is the alex ich ap master yi one :^)
[2:06:48] fljqpy: deja vu
[2:07:30] najafan: Ez bard is a fun lane.
[2:07:33] luxury_ball: lucid with 2 games on vi snore
[2:07:53] fljqpy: lucid on vi duty
[2:07:54] Aoyos_: All bard ult can do is force Xayah ult
[2:08:01] fljqpy: just like canyon on maokai duty
[2:08:03] BUBBLESHINOBI: effort on bard scares me more than most concepts that exist about monsters
[2:08:22] Esterifikace: I have the same thing with doss bard
[2:08:23] Karego: Is bard any good for cucking the vi engage?
[2:08:25] Dzy3D: youre gonna love this game /s
[2:08:29] luxury_ball: @BUBBLESHINOBI maybe bard is the champ to save effort like it saved kaiser
[2:08:39] Aoyos_: @Karego Too slow
[2:08:43] Oraclon: didnt brion outdraft themselves by going seju first sthree?
[2:08:44] najafan: Magical journey is high value here, but ult isn't.
[2:09:14] BUBBLESHINOBI: @luxury_ball surprisingly a lot of inter support are good on bard just I dont believe in this one

[2:10:42] Aoyos_: Rakan can just freely attempt engages
[2:11:17] eck1e: i havent watched enough to know, but is xayah exclusively picked with rakan or do teams value her as a standalone champion in this meta
[2:11:30] BUBBLESHINOBI: @Aoyos_ I mean technically if bard lands Q on rakan while he dashes it makes xayah rakan hard to play. But that is too many hypotheticals
[2:11:54] luxury_ball: @eck1e there hasnt been a lot of xayah
[2:11:57] najafan: @eck1e Well they picked Rakan first.
[2:12:01] fljqpy: xayah without rakan LUL
[2:12:02] Aoyos_: He can just E out if the engage attempt sucks
[2:12:24] luxury_ball: @Aoyos_ neither party is that threatened in this lane matchup
[2:12:30] Aoyos_: Yeah
[2:13:06] Karego: Is the jax leap animation is different? Feels like it stays lower to the ground and is harder to react to
[2:13:37] najafan: Winken. Blinken. And Nod.
[2:13:53] fljqpy: yea t1 used the 6 grubs to steal drakes and barons LUL
[2:14:04] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo what do you think about grubbies for drake trades. Seems like some bad teams would fall into the trap of getting them with no splutpush potential champs
[2:14:10] wyzrdsnvrdie: Do you need 6 or just 5
[2:14:12] Aman_CA: what three greek pantheon names would you select for Grubs?
[2:14:14] fljqpy: its just geng macro
[2:14:19] Aoyos_: They can still be great value without having all 6 because you can push so much faster later on, makes those baron/dragon dances a lot harder to calculate
[2:14:47] Birbmang_: man we have seen a lot of bad azir play the last week
[2:15:00] jbirdtattoo: when are you doing the talk show with Dominic and Dgod?
[2:15:12] fljqpy: dominic and dgod LUL
[2:15:18] Loxi9: @jbirdtattoo its coming back next week

[2:15:29] luxury_ball: even if your team doesnt benefit the most from the grubs it can be of value to deny the 5/6 grub buff from enemy team
[2:15:31] Aman_CA: Dominic Torreto - Gillus
[2:15:47] najafan: The Grubs: The Father (IS A GRUB) IS NOT The Son (IS A GRUB) IS NOT The Holy Ghost (IS A GRUB) IS NOT The Father
[2:15:50] BUBBLESHINOBI: yeah in this game both teams took the right objective for them but I feel like a lot of bad teams wont identify these things. Hopefully they do tho its not hard to get
[2:15:50] jbirdtattoo: I miss the weekly T1 roasts. Excited for it to come back
[2:15:52] fljqpy: full clear vi
[2:15:56] Loxi9: what is a powerspike? what power are u spiking? Kappa
[2:16:21] najafan: The Grubs are 3 hypostases but one ousia.
[2:16:29] Birbmang_: the lucian level 2 power spike... i miss qtpie
[2:16:30] fljqpy: luciano is the first of the powerspikes
[2:16:32] Birbmang_: he should make a return to lcs
[2:16:38] Karego: Like Rotatoes
[2:16:43] jbirdtattoo: do you agree with the LCK casters naming the Grubs - Kevins?
[2:16:49] Birbmang_: probably
[2:16:52] Tameimpala2: so do I, that was a nasty Rookern last night tho
[2:16:52] wiMc13: he does TFT
[2:16:54] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo after you finish powerspike you should evolve to powercreep which is gonna be a podcast of how fed up with riot you are. Ohh wait that is summoning insight
[2:16:55] oxidexd: yeah
[2:16:56] fljqpy: streams valo
[2:16:57] jbirdtattoo: streaming TFT he hit GM
[2:17:01] Aman_CA: He had 1.4k earlier
[2:17:03] wyzrdsnvrdie: I powerspike watching powerspike while I powerspike in game
[2:17:03] Loxi9: i like ed edd and eddie
[2:17:05] Birbmang_: should call them Ed, edd and eddgy
[2:17:08] riley_bruce_: same exact stream it has always been haha hip hop and memes
[2:17:09] t3lawrence: ed, edd, and eddy
[2:17:10] Birbmang_: eddy*
[2:17:19] najafan: OOF
[2:17:19] fljqpy: jesus
[2:17:26] najafan: That ult
[2:17:35] MissingMatter: Sometimes your realm level is spiking, nowadays
[2:17:38] Birbmang_: make lcs go full wwe and have Qtpie be the commissioner
[2:17:41] Fedric0: good grief, that dive was botched
[2:17:46] Esterifikace: that ult truly did send a message
[2:17:51] Aman_CA: @MonteCristo 3 greek pantheon names for grubs suggestion?
[2:18:13] MissingMatter: The grubs should be Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.
[2:18:19] fljqpy: its just grubhub central
[2:18:19] MansoGanzo: kingen is not good enough for a team like damwon
[2:18:22] Tameimpala2: my realm levels spike when I use my rookern
[2:18:28] najafan: @MonteCristo Again, just go with them being three hypostases, one ousia.
[2:18:29] Fedric0: The grubs i.e. the moirai
[2:18:34] Loxi9: thats what players have been calling them in champs queue @montecristo
[2:18:36] addaberry: the cerberus
[2:18:43] Karego: more value than ez ult at least Kappa
[2:18:46] Loxi9: grubhub grubs
[2:18:46] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo they should call them lovecraftian names
[2:18:47] smithpw: Can we get the Joe's Cran Shack Shuttle?
[2:18:51] jbirdtattoo: that's actually brilliant but the Grubs themselves don't look that appealing and tasty for a food sponsor
[2:18:52] watersidegnat: "The mcdonalds dragon"
[2:18:54] fljqpy: when u get al 6 u get the grubhub special
[2:18:58] MansoGanzo: lmao "faker just bought the McDonald's© Deathcap"
[2:19:29] fljqpy: imagine its different fastfood items every game
[2:19:32] JohnHEXA: what did you think of kt?
[2:19:34] Karego: Did. He. just. Give. Him?
[2:19:36] t3lawrence: ..
[2:19:39] t3lawrence: .....
[2:19:44] Nimosenpai: He thought he was gonna jump over the wall I guess
[2:19:45] MansoGanzo: effort on low quality crack
[2:19:47] najafan: Wanted to wrap around and bind Xayah, I think
[2:19:50] BUBBLESHINOBI: did they both just tunnelvision on xayah and forget rakan can do stuff
[2:20:02] luxury_ball: just oneshot him, duuh
[2:20:04] najafan: Ez is coming up the lane
[2:20:14] Loxi9: @johnhexa looked good, but fox looked terrible so its hard to say

[2:22:15] Fedric0: "now he's too deep, oh no HE'S too deep, oh wait no HE'S too deep" - what a mess of a fight
[2:22:20] Loxi9: @montecristo how can one brand sponsor multiple teams in the same league? just found out kia sponsors both nrg and c9, wtf?
[2:22:25] Aoyos_: Same cd on TP for both
[2:22:48] Neumonyx: can I just say again - thanks - thanks for Bangers, its such a good show
[2:22:59] fljqpy: yea and KIA sponsors the whole LEC
[2:23:04] fljqpy: thats why G2 lost to NRG
[2:23:06] fljqpy: 4Head
[2:23:17] Aoyos_: Poppy ult was just to block Jax from going back to base to heal before the TP, it actually gets Jax killed cuz he TP's in half hp
[2:23:33] Loxi9: @fljqpy and why g2 won vs damwon kia KEKW
[2:23:46] Esterifikace: I call that a clean drake
[2:23:48] Aoyos_: He also wanted to heal, they were both half hp
[2:23:55] BUBBLESHINOBI: am sorry wtf did gideon do on this crab he cancelled autos he used Q for 1 pixel
[2:24:08] fljqpy: that was a fluke
[2:24:15] isoliditize: monte, are you still sponsored by esports bets ?
[2:25:12] Aoyos_: Yeah the idea was to block Jax from backing without losing minions while Poppy goes heal and TP's in, the cd was just a couple seconds too long

[2:29:01] Fissiccisst: This bad dragon call brought to you by Bad Dragon (tm)
[2:29:02] najafan: @zionsick targeted one enemy champ. Only that enemy champ could damage you for some period of time.
[2:29:02] MansoGanzo: "hey dom which one do you think would fit better in T1 fanbase?"
[2:29:13] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo you should get a tenga sponsor and make top 3 sucks of the week segment
[2:29:13] najafan: Like a proto Morde ult.
[2:29:15] Naxser: @MonteCristo Do you believe hle would play like gen.g because of the macro from peanut?
[2:29:16] Loxi9: what if they made a mold of faker's dick for wolf? would be insane for the monte and wolf show LUL
[2:29:19] LSDMTG: are there sponsors that you automatically refuse due to the nature of the products
[2:29:30] lyfjabergen: Would be a mindflayer one no?
[2:29:39] riley_bruce_: as they should
[2:29:44] najafan: @LSDMTG Well, NEOM.
[2:29:51] riley_bruce_: my jungler has to be doing something must be bad dragon
[2:29:51] Tameimpala2: the furry market goes crazy for sales tho
[2:29:53] Aoyos_: @zionsick You ult a target, during the duration you take no damage from anyone other than the ult target. You also deal bonus damage to the target
[2:30:10] LSDMTG: @najafan eheh
[2:30:16] fljqpy: the classic podcast sponsorship
[2:30:21] GPAlexander: so what im hearing is you believe in bad dragons
[2:30:23] Fedric0: oh good grief, bad dragon sells hoodies too
[2:30:24] fljqpy: just anything will do
[2:30:31] Bladetykon: no raid shadow legends sponsorship then

[2:30:46] LSDMTG: honestly i respect furries and all types of bad dragon users
[2:30:50] LSDMTG: they just go in
[2:30:53] LSDMTG: pun intended
[2:30:56] riley_bruce_: think thats the new season in general. game will settle in time
[2:31:03] najafan: @Bladetykon It's the largest growing mobile game in the world, why not? Kappa
[2:31:10] Duje275: that lucid flash was wild
[2:31:12] Esterifikace: the lucid flash xdd
[2:31:18] Aoyos_: BRO is probably gonna revolve completely around Morgan as a carry threat, it's gonna be depressing
[2:31:45] PRO_TAGe: @MonteCristo if you get a bad-dragon lookalike emote I'll sub just sayin
[2:32:05] BUBBLESHINOBI: DRIFT KING
[2:32:07] LSDMTG: cristoTRAIN cristoTRAIN
[2:32:08] Karego: ???

[2:32:17] iiTzLos: LUL
[2:32:17] riley_bruce_: wtf he doin haha
[2:32:28] Loxi9: L9 DRIFTING
[2:32:34] riley_bruce_: DELAYED ULT HUGE
[2:32:35] Duje275: Bro was 2 steps ahead of himself
[2:32:42] Oraclon: there are vi combos where you can "hook" people with R+flash
[2:32:43] tt__q: maybe tried to dodge sej r?
[2:33:04] JeeFour: I was gonna ask u what that was about, but we on the same level it seems
[2:33:12] fljqpy: these zoomers and their reaction times
[2:33:15] Komarimasita: yeah ive never seen r flash like that on vi
[2:33:24] BUBBLESHINOBI: he flashes sej E proc cuz he is on 3/4
[2:33:37] najafan: Ah, that makes sense
[2:33:59] Oraclon: ah, makes more sense yes
[2:34:01] Fire_elemen6: doesn't the ult make you unstoppable though?
[2:34:05] isoliditize: r is unstoppable so it didn’t matter
[2:34:11] PRO_TAGe: unintentional? Regrets R?
[2:34:12] BUBBLESHINOBI: he maybe got scared they are gonna oneshot him
[2:34:13] Loxi9: yea thats what i was gonna say
[2:34:22] JeeFour: so that was flashy/over playing
[2:34:29] Fedric0: looked flashy tho
[2:34:39] Mr_Something__: He even knocks up the Sej before the flash. Really weird flash.
[2:34:49] BUBBLESHINOBI: at the end of the day we are trying to make sense of something that doesnt
[2:34:54] fljqpy: its just aiming
[2:35:05] riley_bruce_: @BUBBLESHINOBI such is life
[2:35:06] Komarimasita: the only reason would be if he thought he would get bursted before r completes
[2:35:11] trueaether: the tldr of this series is just "aiming is a god" right?
[2:35:17] Aoyos_: Bring back umti
[2:35:21] fljqpy: more like aiming is a human
[2:35:33] Loxi9: lck is so polarizing idk
[2:35:43] Aoyos_: @trueaether tldr is BRO has no upside

[2:36:23] JeeFour: TL?  I been outta it.. Umti on TL in LCS?
[2:36:28] riley_bruce_: imaqtpie #MakeLCSGreatAgain
[2:36:31] jooshboxes: didn’t TL have one more import slot? why keep apa and Ye on?
[2:36:32] Aoyos_: @trueaether Legitimately should have been replaced long ago
[2:36:48] trueaether: tragic
[2:36:59] fljqpy: YE is in TL?
[2:37:02] Loxi9: @jooshboxes core really likes yeon, and i think they just want to give apa another shot since he showed some promise
[2:37:08] fljqpy: when did he start playing LOL
[2:37:13] JeeFour: Dah faq is this TL team?.......
[2:37:22] Aoyos_: Even academy supports are a better choice
[2:37:49] riley_bruce_: EZ
[2:37:56] Fire_elemen6: Effort knows Ghost Pog
[2:37:57] fljqpy: he IS the commissioner
[2:37:59] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Maybe they can't be bothered to put in the *effort* to recruit someone else.  Kappa
[2:38:03] MansoGanzo: @fljqpy this 100%
[2:38:06] Mr_Something__: D: LCK commissioner locked in Effort's basement
[2:38:08] Lemarc7: is it genja too?
[2:38:11] najafan: Isn't it just Faker in a wig?
[2:38:16] Komarimasita: BRO Rekkles
[2:38:38] fljqpy: the godfather
[2:38:43] Imaslapyou: Are you the commissioner?
[2:38:44] Tears_0f_sin: does no1 actually know who it is
[2:38:44] Zebrios: It's almost like there isn't one...
[2:38:45] Tears_0f_sin: or is it a meme
[2:38:48] BigMightyena: LCK commissioner is just a figment of our imagination LUL
[2:38:52] Aoyos_: @Tears_0f_sin They don't
[2:38:59] MansoGanzo: maybe the LCK comissioner is the friends we made along the way
[2:39:07] Fedric0: maybe it's a musical chairs situation, so it has to be a generic title - so fun!
[2:39:12] Tears_0f_sin: @Tears_0f_sin hows that even possible lol
[2:39:34] Duje275: Gotta be Huni
[2:39:37] Aoyos_: @Tears_0f_sin Says everything about the state of the league
[2:39:53] fljqpy: Bedge
[2:40:10] Loxi9: its me im the commissioner :)
[2:40:25] Dzy3D: I think lucid needs the music
[2:40:30] trueaether: Envyy seems like a passable adc, was his laning bad?
[2:40:35] Komarimasita: how crazy would power spike be if dom became lpl comish and monte was lck's
[2:40:35] Oraclon: how did rakan get slowed so muich?
[2:40:45] Aoyos_: Perfect is just the greatest player to ever debut

[2:42:04] Fedric0: Kingen have had some solid ults this game
[2:42:29] TheTraderKing: they warded the barron pit and then they all backed and DK just sprinted to it LUL
[2:42:53] eck1e: @Aoyos_ that i get, but i dont quite get the vi having one, i guess its just really cheap

[2:48:54] trueaether: poppy also ruins BRO'
