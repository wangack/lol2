[0:44:49] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists
[0:45:00] pozornetoperku: !yasuo

[0:59:33] ftUncleDrew: @rexmundideus bronze comment
[0:59:43] mlgnoobscope: @ftUncleDrew nah splitting works in almost all elos
[0:59:52] mlgnoobscope: literally most broken strategy
[0:59:56] wontonamo_bae: why am i realizing only now that trundle went teleport
[1:00:01] killmepl34: !HULLBREAKER
[1:00:06] vBrandtz: splitting if done correctly is instant dubs
[1:00:07] Kub502: guy like me might ult that kayne no lie good he didnt
[1:00:07] killmepl34: !hull
[1:00:11] mlgnoobscope: @wontonamo_bae i think he realized that tp is better vs ranged matchups
[1:00:21] AhmedNasrX: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[1:00:34] wontonamo_bae: yeah, it would make sense because hes just going to get abused out of lane most of the time
[1:00:35] tasfia__: RUNN
[1:00:42] Mourf: yesterday I played LoL again after month without. got against a garen, never had so much fun seeing a garen run from me the whole line phase. but in the end my team gave him kills after kills later ...

[1:01:21] mlgnoobscope: @kingajeey just tunnel visioned
[1:01:22] AgrioxinesGamingAG: !trynda
[1:01:23] Nightbot: try not to let him stack fury he gets fury by autoing minions so just slow push vs him, kite around pillar when he ults if possible
[1:01:26] postmannnn: so not trinity force or hullbreaker for split pushing anymore?
[1:01:28] vBrandtz: if you play split champs like trundle having tp is just constant pressure to end game
[1:01:30] vBrandtz: too chill
[1:01:30] kingajeey: quin  should have gone to nash and stay alive
[1:01:37] mlgnoobscope: @postmannnn hes probably gonna sell dorna sfor hullbrekaer

[1:02:02] kjaery0y0vl: !mordekaiser
[1:02:02] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm
[1:02:04] Kub502: u can get most towers now without either hull or trinity TBH
[1:02:07] mlgnoobscope: @SgtHater can't waste a single second not hitting tower

[1:02:51] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists

[1:54:45] bekhon: !sion
[1:54:45] Nightbot: your e stops his ult. Dont bother wasting your e on cancelling the q unless you have to because it will go on a short cd so your just wasting it, you can just dodge with w

[1:54:48] LycanLuis: !nasus
[1:54:48] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists
