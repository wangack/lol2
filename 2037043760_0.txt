[0:09:11] Bilalligator: i dont feel like this is a comprehensive test
[0:09:12] jaggler: i can't believe we will never have a funny title again, RIP :(
[0:09:16] Josso9: where's the degenerate unicorn
[0:09:26] vashcooks: Is the aquamarine unicorn hardstuck emerald

[0:11:13] Bilalligator: @moony_jpg its like the end of january, why you slacking
[0:11:33] moony_jpg: @Bilalligator because i was in the UK for literally half of december
[0:11:40] Bilalligator: fair point
[0:11:52] Bilalligator: i have a very bad cough and im praying its not covid
[0:11:57] moony_jpg: Prayge
[0:12:00] raxxman: yeah it should have been hotfixed
[0:12:25] PleasureOfTension: are there any ads that SHOULDN'T be going support item on the current patch?
[0:12:28] raxxman: Think it'll be in the proplay this weekend?
[0:12:37] Bilalligator: if you bait them to harass you, they lose econ
[0:13:23] PleasureOfTension: Thanks for the insight!
[0:13:30] spiritead: if you marry Andrew tate you could nick meditate!
[0:14:04] spiritead: medic + tate = meditate, it was a joke
[0:15:07] spiritead: yeah yeah ofc, I thought that realm of jokes were right down your ally
[0:15:36] spiritead: yeah ofc
[0:15:39] spiritead: ignore him
[0:15:39] PleasureOfTension: What kind of plant do you have behind you?
[0:15:48] jaggler: Aware
[0:16:03] jaggler: botanist medic
[0:16:13] Bilalligator: green for now
[0:16:15] Necrosity: No hecking way, i have green plants too!
[0:16:21] yoyom987: There appears to be another on the other side of the room. Is that also green?
[0:16:23] Gaslord90: If you went paragliding. you would be Paramedic Kappa
[0:16:24] PleasureOfTension: I look forward to this descriptive analysis during your casts!
[0:16:38] jaggler: he loves plant's so much, his previous nickname was "Zyra"
[0:17:21] tfisz98: which games are you casting this week? @MedicCasts
[0:17:44] PleasureOfTension: weird ult by vayne...
[0:19:56] Rockatona: Nice what ya doing there?
[0:21:30] jaggler: kinda rude by nocturne
[0:21:34] Sylvain269: Have you ever played Lethal Company and if so, did you enjoy it?
[0:21:39] jaggler: you should ask them not to do that
[0:21:52] MyNameIsKyan: ngl you looking fresh my man
[0:22:03] Sylvain269: It looks pretty fun, like SCP and I enjoyed that game a ton
[0:22:06] Sylvain269: If you've heard of SCP
[0:22:20] jaggler: you can't build solstice sleigh, it is not the solstice
[0:22:30] jaggler: you do look fresh on smol screen
[0:22:49] shade97485: did u watch rekkles games today
[0:23:08] jaggler: saved by Bard Pog
[0:23:30] P4n_luca: Rip funny title Sadge
[0:23:42] jaggler: 1/4 Veig Aware
[0:23:50] Sylvain269: Wait did the Vayne build a support item?
[0:23:51] Bilalligator: veigar is scaling dont worry
[0:24:03] Sylvain269: Wow that's broken
[0:24:06] Sylvain269: Like objectively
[0:24:28] jaggler: it do be broken
[0:24:52] P4n_luca: Noc would be my ban if i didnt suck against fizz
[0:25:02] PleasureOfTension: I ban Draven every game no matter what state he's in just because I can't STAND playing against good dravens. Ruins my mood
[0:25:14] Bilalligator: scaling immobile mage should play safe in lane?
[0:26:23] jaggler: Not the veigar calling jgl diff KEKW
[0:26:50] Jazzgar: sry i beat your ass so bad you wont be sitting down for a week medicTurtle
[0:26:51] P4n_luca: Imagine MadLions writing in allchat against KC.. "im sorry" xdd
[0:26:59] jaggler: i think the intent is different, but it just comes across a bit cringe
[0:27:24] jaggler: stormsurged Aware
[0:27:28] shade97485: is ashe super broken or sth...everybody keeps banning it on red side
[0:27:41] Sylvain269: Elite500?
[0:27:42] Rockatona: Elti500? :D
[0:27:44] Auroxanex_Pendragon: Elite500?
[0:27:54] Sylvain269: He's not the best
[0:28:01] Sylvain269: But he's good
[0:28:05] Bilalligator: czekochad
[0:28:06] SlitheryPotato: I like that my last mid game I won lane solo killed enemy mid 3 times but bc I had a 0/5/0 split pushing fiora and a 0/12/5 jgl and its a mid different game xD
[0:28:06] zajchyy: oh yeah
[0:28:13] Sylvain269: He's also the only Vladimir player that I know of
[0:28:14] zajchyy: Opat04 on twitch
[0:28:19] jaggler: but how good is he at checkers? Kappa
[0:28:25] Auroxanex_Pendragon: Def not elite500
[0:28:34] hopellesboi: viegar just ulted thenoc spellshield how in the kentucky fried fuck did he manage thta
[0:28:43] shade97485: unlucky game
[0:29:17] jaggler: having a bad game happens. But blaming others when you yourself succ is not the move
[0:29:24] PleasureOfTension: How do you feel about getting into herald making you invulnerable? I understand WHY it's the case but it just kind of feels...off imo
[0:30:34] PleasureOfTension: Maybe I'm biased because I saw someone dodging cait ult with it and getting a double kill on reddit earlier LMAO
[0:30:37] shade97485: why no f
[0:30:50] shade97485: f this game
[0:31:04] shade97485: yes
[0:31:06] zajchyy: the positive thing is that next game probably won't be worse than this
[0:31:24] Auroxanex_Pendragon: someone actually voted no
[0:31:33] shade97485: wow cool transistion
[0:32:03] PleasureOfTension: Impressive levels of ineptitude by Veigar. Well done
[0:32:14] Kami_KhaZix: you can trust me smiley face
[0:32:17] Wodash_flow: would you trust me in jungle ?
[0:32:24] Razing_Thresh: how do you think riot can fix the double supp item?
[0:32:27] Rockatona: I had a game where our bot lane was 12/0 up and still managed to loose.  My top and mid died under enemy tower on respawn. :D And my jungle in the enemy jngl.
[0:32:38] yoyom987: Hurtful
[0:32:40] mirxyy: Sorry I didnt play great this game felt like i couldnt do much. Might have been the xayah pick or me not going the support item.
[0:32:42] Bilalligator: he likes our presents
[0:32:42] cashmeyer: its more like believing
[0:32:46] Sylvain269: XD
[0:32:46] Bilalligator: but not our presence
[0:32:49] Wodash_flow: completely fair
[0:32:52] SlitheryPotato: Heartbroken
[0:32:55] Gaslord90: But we make terrible jokes about your twitch name. technically your bff's Kappa
[0:33:01] Rockatona: I mean I am a good laugh when I am drinking
[0:33:07] DatBla: heyo
[0:33:21] jaggler: what do you mean, we have a very strong, healthy parasocial relationship Kappa
[0:33:26] Rockatona: Yeah that is a nice idea
[0:33:37] DatBla: currently lacking motivation to do things, so imma relax with some top tier league gameplay
[0:33:48] shade97485: penalty to everyone with sup item?
[0:33:50] Snausert: !opgg
[0:33:50] StreamElements: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/MedicCasts | https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/IamRakenough
[0:33:58] HeckMayster: morning im here for some top tier gaemplay
[0:34:00] jaggler: Play ARAM, no support items there Kappa
[0:34:05] cashmeyer: do you think the absence of a proper preseason is hurting the game? @MedicCasts
[0:34:12] shade97485: wouldnt that be a new thing for troll players to do
[0:34:29] Bilalligator: the double support item thing would have been clocked in pre season
[0:34:40] HeckMayster: maybe hurts the first weeks of esports but not necessarily the game? everything just gets delayed a few weeks
[0:35:20] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[0:35:21] Khitchary_: do people give top last pick a lot
[0:35:56] Bilalligator: top counter is the most valuable
[0:36:13] Bilalligator: fair point
[0:36:16] HeckMayster: also dont wanna early pick renekton into a teamcomp that can keep you away
[0:36:20] Bilalligator: top is the most counterable pick
[0:36:21] HeckMayster: for example
[0:36:34] shade97485: isnt vayne early pick bad
[0:36:49] lec_airport_speedrun: But jhin FP is worse
[0:36:51] P4n_luca: Top counter is valueble but a lot of times people dont feel confident plsying the counter and they just play ksante anyways
[0:36:52] lec_airport_speedrun: So it's fine
[0:37:34] SlitheryPotato: Same vayne has last game
[0:37:49] Khitchary_: does rakan have counterpicks
[0:37:56] HeckMayster: never been a fan of soloqueue nidalee jungle, on your team. On enemy team its 12/0/3 dominating everything by itself obviously
[0:37:57] SlitheryPotato: Karma
[0:38:00] P4n_luca: Case and point xdd
[0:38:07] Just_a_PixeI: I've had so many top laners int from drafts just because people won't switch
[0:38:14] HeckMayster: lulu?
[0:38:17] spiritead: and leona right?
[0:38:20] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:38:26] shade97485: lolthe pain
[0:38:29] P4n_luca: MikyX Lissandria is good into rakan
[0:38:33] Khitchary_: that is strange I dont love last min dodges as much
[0:38:34] johnsaxonofleague: I did a last minute dodge yetserady, I am a bad person
[0:38:42] spiritead: but rakan got a new prestige skin, it trumfs all the counters
[0:38:50] SlitheryPotato: Karma counters so many supports right now xX copium
[0:39:01] johnsaxonofleague: oh it was more like 20, and I hated the draft
[0:39:06] daftce: what rank is this?
[0:39:07] LoLRankBot: Medic is Diamond II 1 LP  | Altaccount is Platinum III 75 LP
[0:39:08] Gaslord90: Lettuce play the game :)
[0:39:12] coklov69: dodges are so precious that you hope someone else does it first loll
[0:39:23] Khitchary_: what do you feel about teemo support?  idk if it is just my scrub elo but i always feel like he doesnt help a lot
[0:39:23] johnsaxonofleague: inkling
[0:40:09] bigmeatyclackers: is pyke strong atm?
[0:40:43] SlitheryPotato: Teemo support can be good if you just counter jgling with him being annoying not really a support persay
[0:40:50] shade97485: oh no varus  ashe
[0:41:07] mountaindragon99: PogChamp
[0:41:13] Khitchary_: i once was in jg and pyke support took smite and would randomly show up and steal my farm :(((
[0:41:21] SlitheryPotato: Varus tank lets go u.u
[0:41:34] DiceMetalMike: Trusting your team is a casual player move, it's the gigachad shot caller best rakan world that's gonna put the team on his back today
[0:42:02] shade97485: why fleet here u would get outranged by ashe and varus..
[0:42:20] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[0:42:46] jaggler: you job is to Ult Shen while he is trying to Ult Kappa
[0:42:46] KERREMERRES: is ashe supp viable?
[0:42:48] Rojanosa: Any tip to when to roam as a bard/pyke/rakan
[0:42:59] Rodnelas: hey medic how have you been!
[0:43:09] Rodnelas: @KERREMERRES i play her she still feels nice
[0:43:12] shade97485: ashe is perma ban on red side in pro play
[0:43:30] KERREMERRES: why is teemo sup a thing now?
[0:43:50] Rojanosa: Oh thanks, that is very useful advice!
[0:44:01] shade97485: @KERREMERRES sucks on lane but the shrroms with new items hurt alot
[0:44:52] narnsberg: Teemo supp is kinda a thing. Emerald+ 52.14% win rate
[0:45:35] shade97485: ashe is trolling
[0:45:49] Rodnelas: does anyone know if reckless won i saw he won game one
[0:45:50] Sandrian: No funny title? medicLeaveFinger
[0:46:00] tindyerso: good morning pro player Medic catClap ezz
[0:46:15] DatBla: @Sandrian youll just have to Chime in with your own
[0:46:29] DatBla: get it? cause hes playing bard? I'll see myself out
[0:46:36] shade97485: @Rodnelas they stomped game1 on senna but game 2 they lost a winning game and game 3 they got stomped
[0:46:37] ZonieEU: NISQY FAN xdd
[0:46:37] DatBla: oof

[0:47:37] Rodnelas: @Rodnelas you are telling me the only games he won in lck challengers were on senna, i did hear that he wasnt the reason they losing tho and that he is playing well
[0:47:57] ZonieEU: LITERALLY INTING YOU
[0:48:01] ZonieEU: ASDSAD ASD
[0:48:01] Gergzilla: he killed u
[0:48:01] Khitchary_: this guy is def trolling
[0:48:03] ZonieEU: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[0:48:10] shade97485: is there a fixed pattern on where chimes spawn?
[0:48:11] MightySapo: i think it was warded
[0:48:20] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[0:48:28] Bilalligator: @shade97485 no
[0:48:49] MightySapo: they do spawn deeper with the time
[0:49:02] ZonieEU: bro this brand
[0:49:04] capooka: xddddd
[0:49:32] smortny: good morning everyone owo7

[0:50:38] Rojanosa: WHO SAID THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE WORSE THAN THE OTHER GAME?
[0:50:44] Rojanosa: WHO IS TO BLAME?
[0:50:51] Gergzilla: Gotta tell Nisqy his fans are inting your games
[0:50:59] shade97485: if enemy doesnt troll this game is over
[0:51:01] Bilalligator: jamadas son
[0:52:12] cashmeyer: do u think ur role choice has something to do with ur career choice?
[0:52:14] shade97485: ohno
[0:52:16] DatBla: oof
[0:52:31] mhcrawler: definition of insanity
[0:52:35] Matejvo7: ofc it is Pisqy fan
[0:52:38] shade97485: shouldnt brand be clearing till 6
[0:52:50] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[0:52:51] kurt_mp: You must die in unwinnable fights and then blame team
[0:53:01] FeomatarSG: for games like that your only choice to press report, check negative, mute, go next game
[0:53:11] Squallly: Good morning Medic, good morning chat! medicHi
[0:53:13] narnsberg: He's playing Flash brand. Makes it very hard for him to dodge skills
[0:53:16] solidussovis: I dont get why you keep trying to assist him. Leave him to die so they only get 1 kill
[0:53:50] Khitchary_: is this game actually salvageable
[0:54:03] kurt_mp: It is in his nature to help people
[0:54:52] lec_airport_speedrun: Mr caster why are you being toxic
[0:55:08] mhcrawler: daaaaaayum
[0:55:14] kurt_mp: He's a gamer
[0:55:17] Squallly: Squallly subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! TAKE MY SUB AND GO ON YOUR FANCY HOLIDAY!  Have a great time, man.
[0:55:30] Khitchary_: this is madness
[0:55:39] Zelgas: it's one of those games
[0:55:47] shade97485: tank  lux  is a thing
[0:55:54] hoogemast: conqueror lux going roa
[0:55:59] spicypiquant: idk if this lux picked wrong but i have seen some tank lux stuff happening with conq
[0:56:03] shade97485: therre is a build for tank lux
[0:56:06] yoyom987: wait is loser's queue a thing?
[0:56:16] daftce: yea
[0:56:24] yoyom987: oh :( I was gonna blame my silver status...damn
[0:56:41] daftce: i am gonna cope that it is a thing
[0:57:14] yoyom987: As a caster, how much do you know about the development process of league?
[0:57:25] Khitchary_: i mean when you win too much doesnt the mmr system try to makethe game consistently harder and that is what climbing is?
[0:57:26] Rodnelas: @MedicCasts when we playing palworld
[0:57:34] RhyzeRhyze: zero damage lux lol
[0:57:35] Zelgas: getting kills and objectives is the worst thing that could happen now, because it gives you hope
[0:57:43] P4n_luca: What sucks is that most games would be winnable if ppls mental was a stronger..
[0:57:47] Rodnelas: oh you leaving soon? enjoy your holiday
[0:58:00] hoogemast: Yeah it is kinda weird how that works, but also in numbers it works out. I have had multiple games in a row where my teammates had like 40-50% wr vs opponents having 50-60% wr. I dont know how that is fair matchmaking even if they are "higher" rank
[0:59:02] mayiiq: that's respectable, so many people just give up for no reason
[0:59:10] janoseyes: wait... is that dracos´s music?
[0:59:10] lec_airport_speedrun: @p4n_luca no if you concede first blood the game is unplayable 100% of the time scaling doesn't exist enemy team plays 100% perfectly even in iron 4 must FF to save time
[0:59:32] janoseyes: not my usual taste still pretty dope
[0:59:47] Rojanosa: FIND HIM
[0:59:49] Tibolight: me :)
[0:59:49] yoyom987: perma ban them!
[0:59:52] jaggler: BAN THEm
[0:59:52] slggemckvack: next will always be better Kappa
[0:59:56] janoseyes: caster gets caster cursed lmao
[0:59:57] P4n_luca: Hide him!
[0:59:58] 4Dropp: me :)
[1:00:03] yoyom987: put them in loser's queue!
[1:00:05] Monstruxv: it was Eye
[1:00:06] jaggler: Thrid game CANNOT POSSIBLY be that bad :)
[1:00:06] lec_airport_speedrun: Me :)

[1:00:38] Squallly: Are you likely to stream tomorrow, or is your pre-holiday 'swansong' this gravy train? :p
[1:00:44] Monstruxv: @FeomatarSG good luck :D
[1:00:45] Zelgas: surely it won't be
[1:00:51] stenvig: wanna bet it can? :P
[1:01:10] Khitchary_: can we gamble our channel points
[1:01:15] Khitchary_: on if the next ame is worse
[1:01:41] jucchanUwU: we got him team
[1:01:55] Zelgas: fizz is scared of the comeback
[1:01:57] P4n_luca: Enemies that get lucky and rub salt in the wound are the worst

[1:04:17] raczouknow: if ur at
[1:04:18] Zelgas: if you're at 0 and lose
[1:04:19] narnsberg: At 0 and lose
[1:04:20] Rodnelas: after multiple losses at 0
[1:04:29] raczouknow: yes
[1:04:33] narnsberg: Still at 0 and lose
[1:04:43] Gusto______: also if zour mmr alows it
[1:04:50] Gusto______: *your
[1:04:51] TeamBDS: plink
[1:04:57] Rodnelas: plink
[1:05:08] jucchanUwU: just be keria
[1:05:09] lec_airport_speedrun: Have you tried being good
[1:05:31] lec_airport_speedrun: @jucchanuwu why would you want to be that fraud, at least name a good support like Peter or Rekkles
[1:05:49] P4n_luca: Theres a reason why prod dont reach grandmaster with a 90% WR.. some games are just unwinnable sadly
[1:05:53] FeomatarSG: supports are strong this season but not so much to carry game like that
[1:05:59] Squallly: not even good game; great game
[1:06:03] jucchanUwU: @lec_airport_speedrun very good point, i withdraw my statement
[1:06:09] RhyzeRhyze: conq roa lux is definitely not a build
[1:06:13] zajchyy: tough morning
[1:06:20] RhyzeRhyze: go play swain if you're into battlemage mid
[1:06:26] janoseyes: as a man with such a luxurious beard do you have any tips for a first time beard owner like myself?
[1:06:27] FunkyBarmen: its a build
[1:06:30] FunkyBarmen: tank lux
[1:06:30] cotran61: Sup Medic, hope ur doing fine
[1:06:48] FunkyBarmen: with unending dispair third
[1:07:05] Zelgas: the secret is that keria would not get to that point to begin with as much as other players, because if you stomp in lane, other players will probably believe more in the win and not tilt
[1:07:17] MaraudingBacon: @janoseyes mane-tain. take care of it. check out how to properly wash condition etc. beard oil is great for itch scratchy days. get a decent brush
[1:07:19] P4n_luca: Nemesis tried it in lastest vid and said the build is useless
[1:07:23] RhyzeRhyze: conq is at 43% win rate in emerald+, how is that "a build"
[1:07:27] lec_airport_speedrun: It's a build according to some random 17% winrate iron 2 midlaner who swears he's dia skill
[1:07:35] cotran61: Dont let your mood get influenced too much by League, you know ur better in the game and its only couple lost games, whatever
[1:07:36] lec_airport_speedrun: Who the fuck cares about thag
[1:07:38] cotran61: not the first time its happening
[1:07:55] janoseyes: @MaraudingBacon ty m8 im currently stuck behind 2 min adbreak
[1:08:07] jucchanUwU: @janoseyes i mostly just focus on maintaining a good shape and brushing it out
[1:08:20] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[1:08:29] MaraudingBacon: @MaraudingBacon no worries medic has not responded to you
[1:08:40] cotran61: Thats the consequences of having no preseason imo
[1:08:50] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:08:56] TeamBDS: BASED StreamElements
[1:09:14] MaraudingBacon: BASED @TeamBDS
[1:09:25] lec_airport_speedrun: Whoever made these streamelements prompts needs a raise
[1:09:44] lec_airport_speedrun: Oh wait, that would probably be everyone but medic
[1:12:28] Squallly: Medic, did the tooth fairy come last night? medicKEKW
[1:12:40] lec_airport_speedrun: Totally, yeah
[1:12:45] lec_airport_speedrun: Wait what?
[1:12:54] Squallly: It was a terrible joke.
[1:12:55] lec_airport_speedrun: Why are you a pro player
[1:13:05] lec_airport_speedrun: Conflict of interest anybody???
[1:13:24] janoseyes: aight small brainteaser. if you were to suddenly gain the ability to teleport would you have to breathe out before teleporting to avoid decomressionsickness?
[1:13:43] gtroubleinc: Morning! How are you doing?
[1:13:44] johnsaxonofleague: Just read your title, made me chuckle
[1:13:57] lec_airport_speedrun: Where's !proplayer
[1:14:00] gtroubleinc: Ah shit, whats the score?
[1:14:13] lec_airport_speedrun: We need weekly updates on how hard you've been stomped in lane
[1:14:36] gtroubleinc: Ye idk, it doesnt seem very balanced in general lol
[1:14:36] lec_airport_speedrun: Still, give update
[1:15:11] janoseyes: theseus ship. nice
[1:15:23] gtroubleinc: This is the deepest question I have ever seen in a league stream
[1:15:23] shade97485: rakan?
[1:15:44] TooMuchCoffeePainting: i think youd need to ask about what happens to the air in your target location before you worry about the air in your lungs, or beyond that the bacteria that are part of your system
[1:15:57] Squallly: You wanted a will this game be better / worse gamba?  I've come up with the next best thing :p
[1:16:29] CCGambit: Oh a Medic Leona match! I've not seen one of those in a while.
[1:16:40] P4n_luca: Blinding vayne too is even better
[1:17:01] padtime: into draven vayne XD

[1:17:22] P4n_luca: I mean you can always force negative impact
[1:17:22] kurt_mp: Do fighter pilot not experience decompression sickness due to the altitudes they fly at?
[1:17:35] lec_airport_speedrun: Based
[1:17:35] Flamant_: Good morning Medic first time here love ur casting man♥
[1:17:49] TooMuchCoffeePainting: @kurt_mp thats what pressurised flight suits and cabins are for
[1:18:00] raczouknow: you dont
[1:18:02] hoogemast: you dont
[1:18:03] padtime: how often do you go back on games and rewatch some plays?
[1:18:07] hoogemast: not enough pressure difference
[1:18:20] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord

[1:20:13] lec_airport_speedrun: @chatter you're welcome
[1:20:14] Rojanosa: Any opinion about Rekkles roleswap to support and playing for t1 academy?
[1:20:26] lec_airport_speedrun: Yeah, he'd be best support EU
[1:21:05] lec_airport_speedrun: Or at the very least he probably is up there
[1:21:17] Sploshem: hello
[1:21:25] shade97485: this game might go bad
[1:21:42] lec_airport_speedrun: Oh wait squally

[1:23:20] Gergzilla: and this is why i dont play support lol
[1:23:31] Squallly: i mean, wtf was the back?
[1:23:36] lec_airport_speedrun: Stay base
[1:23:45] lec_airport_speedrun: Excellent chatting from the soraka
[1:23:51] raczouknow: i mean if this happens in ur game as supp, u just abandon bot
[1:23:51] padtime: time to leave lane and look elsewhere

[1:24:37] raczouknow: pog
[1:24:48] Auroxanex_Pendragon: The best Leona skin

[1:25:11] bussinboots: about to hear a mf  rant on the lec cast next time
[1:25:32] bussinboots: fair but this player rant will be coming soon
[1:25:37] lec_airport_speedrun: No you won't, because pro play is stuck in the Lucian aphe phase
[1:25:48] lec_airport_speedrun: With a sprinkling of kalista
[1:26:35] bussinboots: true, i've been trying leth cait mid kinda fun. crit just so behind the curve
[1:26:47] betweentwoblocks: What is this elo? Reminds me way too much of emerald
[1:26:54] lec_airport_speedrun: Dia2
[1:26:59] lec_airport_speedrun: Apparently
[1:27:17] Sylvain269: I don't understand why people in League constantly fight, even if they lose
[1:27:48] Gergzilla: i dont how MF is in this elo
[1:28:11] betweentwoblocks: @Sylvain269 monkey brain syndrome
[1:29:37] DatBla: Oof
[1:29:51] Sylvain269: @betweentwoblocks Lol for real
[1:30:20] StreamElements: Want to stay up to date with all things Team BDS? You can find all their socials over here: https://linktr.ee/TeamBDS medicNoted

[1:30:59] bussinboots: didn't know medic was ambassador for bds

[1:34:31] remixlol1: But in like 1-2 h
[1:34:42] remixlol1: As per usual i´ll be there 13/14
[1:34:43] lec_airport_speedrun: Viewer arams until then imo
[1:34:49] lec_airport_speedrun: Or norms?
[1:34:59] FadiElyateem: ADC feels so weak and useless in this patch
[1:35:17] remixlol1: ADC´s can be the most useless role
[1:35:20] remixlol1: But can be the most op role
[1:35:29] Auroxanex_Pendragon: need items and hands
[1:35:29] remixlol1: It really depends on your team playing around you or not
[1:35:31] lec_airport_speedrun: Which is roughly how it should be, no
[1:35:43] hoogemast: i feel like adc needs a hp based item  bork is based on current hp rn.
[1:35:43] remixlol1: Its really just soloq
[1:36:01] remixlol1: Once you reach higher elos (500lp +) the role becomes a lot easier to play cuz ur team does that they should
[1:36:18] lec_airport_speedrun: (assuming they're not tilted ofc)
[1:36:46] Squallly: WE'RE GAMING
[1:36:47] janoseyes: janoseyes subscribed at Tier 1.

[1:37:21] Squallly: :(
[1:37:35] remixlol1: ITS MY FAULT
[1:37:37] remixlol1: LMAO
[1:37:44] lec_airport_speedrun: Smh
[1:38:08] lec_airport_speedrun: Ban remix for not reminding about ads
[1:38:14] lec_airport_speedrun: Only way forward
[1:38:20] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:38:24] Squallly: absolutely not
[1:38:27] EitheTael: yes but do it
[1:38:30] mayiiq: do it
[1:38:31] janoseyes: its just kinda jarring to listen to the stream and then suddenly hear franz beckenbauer explode into my ears
[1:38:43] jucchanUwU: not bm, correct play actually
[1:39:03] Auroxanex_Pendragon: Gotta show superiority
[1:39:07] zajchyy: how else is he gonna learn not to bm?
[1:39:25] janoseyes: @zajchyy people that play league enough to be decent dont learn anymore
[1:39:35] itstotallyamber: Henlo peeps alowo

[1:42:32] Auroxanex_Pendragon: Support carrying the adc xd
[1:42:40] mhsponge: winning the all chat duel so far
[1:42:42] jucchanUwU: youve caused turmoil within the enemy team
[1:42:54] remixlol1: @Auroxanex_Pendragon Thats how it works. Supp does early to mid game and adcs take over lategame (normally)
[1:42:56] janoseyes: A house devided cannot stand
[1:43:04] Auroxanex_Pendragon: @remixlol1 yee
[1:43:11] janoseyes: i think i only ever watched that movie in german
[1:43:21] Stippel89: They should stop calling it ADC. People think they always need to carry even when they can't or shouldn't :p
[1:43:28] RafTzou: is vayne top a thing? i played my first game in s14 yesterday and a vayne top welcomed me
[1:43:39] jucchanUwU: you typed once and got their whole team Chatting

[1:45:01] Auroxanex_Pendragon: MF has a bounty now LUL
[1:45:33] janoseyes: @cotran61 voidgrubs are fuckin broken
[1:45:47] janoseyes: i may be a bit biased cuz im a toplaner that wants company

[1:47:03] blackobelisk1337: RACIST DRAVEN PLAYERS CLASSIC
[1:47:04] remixlol1: Hey @MedicCasts play ads pls or i get flamed by you later cause you didnt
[1:47:08] janoseyes: G fuckin G
[1:47:15] TheArrowRodrigues: STAY IN BASE
[1:47:15] Zelgas: well played!
[1:47:17] Sploshem: i join stream to mf selling you out and a 3/0 draven. lose a ranked and see you bullying them in fountain.
[1:47:21] Sploshem: well played i thik
[1:47:28] Auroxanex_Pendragon: Got kebab maker in mid kekw
[1:47:30] cotran61: Didnt know ur a professional Soraka hater
[1:47:31] cyan111uk: loud 😟
[1:47:34] cotran61: good to know
[1:47:47] P4n_luca: SorakatoGM gonna be stuck a little longer now

[1:47:57] Rojanosa: but mf got more kills
[1:48:03] hellwalk3r: Howzit Medic, loveyour work bro
[1:48:04] Rojanosa: gamer logic
[1:48:07] lec_airport_speedrun: You won the game, you won the LP
[1:48:09] blackobelisk1337: same damage as Olaf, 1 honor KEKW
[1:48:11] lec_airport_speedrun: But at what cost
[1:48:11] janoseyes: kills = skills everyone knows that
[1:48:14] Squallly: i can run ads
[1:48:15] lec_airport_speedrun: Was it worth it
[1:48:20] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[1:49:54] P4n_luca: Ok what is thst recall hahaha
[1:50:09] zajchyy: im so happy i dont play league anymore, that mf is hard to watch
[1:50:42] P4n_luca: Mf doesnt respect ur roams tho
[1:51:45] TheArrowRodrigues: But Adcs have the weakest mental I don't get it
[1:51:55] lec_airport_speedrun: Do they
[1:51:59] janoseyes: @TheArrowRodrigues adc is the only child role
[1:52:04] lec_airport_speedrun: Is their mental actually weaker than average
[1:52:15] lec_airport_speedrun: Or are you just projecting
[1:52:21] superkwick: People just have a negative attitude early
[1:52:28] TheArrowRodrigues: They feel like they need to be the stars
[1:52:45] TheArrowRodrigues: I'm being a bit toxic apologies LUL
[1:52:48] TheArrowRodrigues: mb
[1:52:50] StreamElements: Oh yes, please give me subby wubbies, feels yummy in my tummy.
[1:52:56] lec_airport_speedrun: I mean, that's whatever
[1:53:04] itstotallyamber: Nah you're good, many people share that view
[1:53:22] lec_airport_speedrun: I just don't particularly agree ADCs are any less mentally stable than the rest of the playerbase
[1:53:25] itstotallyamber: But I don't really think any one role is more toxic than the other
[1:53:46] TheArrowRodrigues: Yeah personalities behind are the major factor
[1:53:52] Squallly: I would possibly say that top laners are less toxic.  But that's because there seems to be more of an acceptance that they're on 'the island', lmao
[1:54:26] itstotallyamber: Man I swear DD's new EP is so good though
[1:54:26] TheArrowRodrigues: Yeah you're right, I shouldn't generalize
[1:54:37] Shengar: hello GOAT Support
[1:54:48] janoseyes: dont know my toplaner never tilts Kappa
[1:54:51] lec_airport_speedrun: I don't see coinflip anywhere
[1:54:53] Shengar: GIGAMEDIC GIGASNEK
[1:54:55] KrollV: Don't know if its an elo thing, but generally the toplaners in my games are the first to spam ping jungle when they lose their lane
[1:54:58] lec_airport_speedrun: Who are you talking to
[1:55:04] KrollV: G'Morning chat and medic!
[1:55:13] Squallly: hey Shengar!  hey Kroll!
[1:55:19] itstotallyamber: @KrollV Mornin' o7
[1:55:25] KrollV: o7
[1:55:27] Shengar: hello GIGAMODS
[1:55:40] itstotallyamber: Shengar UwU
[1:55:47] janoseyes: tbf toplane isnt much more than matchups. imo
[1:56:12] janoseyes: yea but wavecontrol is a factor in all lanes.
[1:56:16] janoseyes: just diffrent
[1:56:50] johnsaxonofleague: bard / cait lane
[1:56:58] P4n_luca: ye i am mid main and whenever i play top i just get frozen on until im tilted and walk up xdd
[1:57:19] janoseyes: id also say that other lanes dont manipulate as pressiely most of the time its push and roam or take prio for objectives.
[1:57:29] lec_airport_speedrun: Over/under 10 deaths
[1:57:29] janoseyes: cant remeber the last time i saw a bot freeze
[1:57:31] lec_airport_speedrun: Gogogo
[1:57:41] remixlol1: @janoseyes everytime medic has a duo :D

[1:59:24] lec_airport_speedrun: Ff
[1:59:28] lec_airport_speedrun: That's a jhin
[1:59:29] Auroxanex_Pendragon: I mean if you're afraid of always being in low then you will always be low

[2:01:00] P4n_luca: rakan and roam time
[2:01:51] theedium: ive always believed everything before diamond is essentially the same skill level and just separated by how much you actually play
[2:01:54] Bilalligator: point and click CC is OP
[2:02:00] theedium: i guess now that might be somewhere in emerald but
[2:02:03] itstotallyamber: Bill AYAYA
[2:02:09] Bilalligator: amba inxL
[2:02:10] theedium: i see no difference between plat and silver players other than games played
[2:02:35] P4n_luca: Did you hear about the Q change for naut next season?
[2:02:38] remixlol1: Diamond is silver with a little better mechanics
[2:02:45] remixlol1: Same mental same macro in 99%
[2:02:46] Squallly: HEY BIL, MY GOOD OLD CONSULTING BUDDY GIGAMEDIC
[2:02:49] Auroxanex_Pendragon: @theedium I personally believe that iron and bronze players don't bother trying hard at all
[2:02:57] Bilalligator: alowo Squallly
[2:02:57] Eorl72: luaWave
[2:03:15] theedium: yeah that elo is either for fun or legit trenches

[2:03:32] itstotallyamber: monkaS
[2:03:40] lec_airport_speedrun: Average rito gaem W
[2:03:46] Rockatona: To be fair most of the time is: Not queue up. :D
[2:03:47] Bilalligator: best gameplay we've seen all day
[2:03:48] remixlol1: Screen capture worst case
[2:03:51] lec_airport_speedrun: Oh wait, that could be OBS, interesting
[2:03:55] Squallly: @Bilalligator - can I make the oft made observation that Monday client meetings suck.  They invariably lead to shitty Fridays.
[2:04:09] KrollV: is that vedi?
[2:04:16] lec_airport_speedrun: Drakos
[2:04:17] itstotallyamber: I think so
[2:04:20] KrollV: that one ad lib sounded a lot like vedi
[2:04:23] Rockatona: How can you win when the top twitch tries to solo baron 2 and gives enemy a free baron?
[2:04:24] lec_airport_speedrun: Wait oh
[2:04:32] itstotallyamber: Nah I think there's a cameo from Vedi
[2:04:32] Bilalligator: @Squallly depends what the meeting is about but i hate the friday scramble to prep something for monday
[2:04:34] lec_airport_speedrun: I see what you mean
[2:04:42] Lullebulle123: Honestly AD ezreal mid is significantly better than AP ezreal mid
[2:04:46] Eorl72: !rank
[2:04:46] Bilalligator: welshius > vedius
[2:04:47] LoLRankBot: Medic is Diamond II 22 LP  | Altaccount is Platinum III 75 LP
[2:04:52] Lullebulle123: but they're worse than an actual midlaner
[2:04:53] remixlol1: @Lullebulle123 Not on this patch
[2:04:53] itstotallyamber: Yeah I did think that might be Nicole on the 4th track
[2:04:59] KrollV: I need welshius rapping in my life
[2:05:02] Eorl72: Get back to Masters fast, I need my funny titles
[2:05:05] Lullebulle123: @Lullebulle123 Every patch, always.
[2:05:38] P4n_luca: happily they auto push the wave when they poke you
[2:06:30] lec_airport_speedrun: Holy fuck LCK just produced the greatest draft of all time
[2:06:33] lec_airport_speedrun: I must go
[2:06:42] DatBla: what did they pick?
[2:07:01] Auroxanex_Pendragon: good Q though
[2:08:20] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[2:08:42] janoseyes: my team just demanded that i pick teemo...
[2:10:04] Squallly: hey, the teemo win rate is pretty much off the scale right now, right?
[2:10:14] jinsungeee: !doctor
[2:10:15] StreamElements: I studied at Norwich Medical School and actually worked as a doctor for a year in the UK before becoming a full time caster! For more watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQCYzqmnRwI&t=659s
[2:10:58] janoseyes: demanding people play champs is a bit cringe tho imo
[2:11:18] itstotallyamber: Yeah let people play whatever they want
[2:11:29] Auroxanex_Pendragon: @janoseyes Yea
[2:11:33] DatBla: I'm excited to see some more variety in champ picks in the pro scene

[2:34:16] Squallly: Medic, that was a sigh of a kid that doesn't have anyone to play with. medicCry
[2:34:22] itstotallyamber: @shlok_051 Don't do it, save yourself
[2:34:32] boom_1424: Lol

[2:38:04] crispytain: fish curry based
[2:38:10] paraxona: Berlin called out
[2:38:11] itstotallyamber: Airfire AYAYA
[2:38:20] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.

[2:38:23] janoseyes: my moms chicken curry > any other curry
[2:38:56] bussinboots: you think we see teemo in pro play this year?
[2:39:03] Airfire: I haven't been able to work up the courage to play chickenman yet but I'm sure I'll get there
[2:39:05] remixlol1: I just read discord
[2:39:08] remixlol1: ....

[2:39:26] remixlol1: and they all hate me
[2:39:29] lec_airport_speedrun: How much losing did I miss
[2:39:31] Baltazars_father: add anything special in tikka masala?
[2:39:37] dwakndwa: As a aph player i would love milio here
[2:39:40] Squallly: Butter chicken is fucking incredible - any curry which you marinade overnight tends to improve its flavour hugely
[2:39:48] Squallly: @lec_airport_speedrun actually back to 2-2
[2:39:56] ruffy1920: play bard
[2:39:57] Squallly: or is it 3-2?  i'm losing track
[2:39:58] lec_airport_speedrun: Wait what the fuck
[2:40:02] ruffy1920: ah nvm
[2:40:05] lec_airport_speedrun: Why is he winning now
[2:40:21] Squallly: you need to send him more 'motivational' speeches
[2:40:29] ruffy1920: o7
[2:40:48] Squallly: choking your enemies
[2:41:09] NieJuicyBug: you don´t eat bayleaves BECAUSE they have too much flavour
[2:41:12] bussinboots: i got a drop hack lobby and i was e1 around 50 lp at the time xD
[2:41:12] sniffelol: who do you think will win lec
[2:41:12] itstotallyamber: Only proper chefs give a shit about bayleaves
[2:41:15] Nanomical: what happened?
[2:41:31] Airfire: ok Medic I need the curry hack from you
[2:41:38] ruffy1920: FirstTimeChadder
[2:41:46] ruffy1920: what rank are you now?
[2:41:47] LoLRankBot: Medic is Diamond II 45 LP  | Altaccount is Platinum III 75 LP
[2:41:50] Airfire: how do you make a curry cooler without putting coconut powder in it (I really hate coconut)
[2:42:08] Squallly: see, i think there's demand for a Medic curry cooking stream... (c'mon people)
[2:42:20] PlzN0: i assume the lobby drop does not count as a leave so no penalty?
[2:42:25] itstotallyamber: Yogurt
[2:42:27] lec_airport_speedrun: I second this
[2:42:35] Nanomical: oh wow, is it like a recent bug or has it always existed?
[2:42:37] lec_airport_speedrun: Give us cooking stream
[2:42:46] Airfire: Oooo yoghurt is a good plan
[2:43:05] Airfire: it's one of the reasons I haven't ventured into currys yet with my cooking learning skills
[2:43:06] itstotallyamber: SeemsGood
[2:43:08] dwakndwa: It is a program that was released fairly recently
[2:43:09] crispytain: statistically SK are winning the LEC and who could argue with that
[2:43:19] Airfire: I have initiated steak night once a week tho
[2:43:30] Squallly: actually, it's not the podcast you want, but it might be a good one: cooking with medi and lec friends.  great chat while you drink vino and cook food :p
[2:43:55] Airfire: I like spicy curry but I tend to be overzealous with spices
[2:43:58] itstotallyamber: So EUphoria with snacks Kappa
[2:44:04] crispytain: @Squallly teaching league players how to actually cook genius
[2:44:33] itstotallyamber: Ed Gamble is a very funny lad
[2:44:41] dwakndwa: Do you think Hans Sama has only played Aphelios because it it srong atm or because he feels like he need practice?
[2:45:16] Squallly: @itstotallyamber much more informal; probably somewhere between euphoria, bevvies with the boys, and hell's kitchen?
[2:45:24] itstotallyamber: haha
[2:45:32] Airfire: against Nemesis's smurf pog
[2:45:35] Airfire: nvm
[2:45:37] itstotallyamber: I do remember them making players do cooking
[2:45:54] lec_airport_speedrun: So a shit ruddy interview
[2:45:57] lec_airport_speedrun: Interesting
[2:46:10] Baltazars_father: getting in-game challenge (impossible)
[2:46:24] itstotallyamber: KEKW
[2:46:29] mlopabc: would jankos not just win cooking by default?
[2:46:30] tedehbe: Sounds hard when most of their life is league @MedicCasts
[2:46:33] itstotallyamber: This was great though
[2:46:49] dwakndwa: Did Caedrel get his hands on it?
[2:47:08] Squallly: did you actually cook these enchiladas? :p
[2:47:11] crispytain: probably harder to set up > other content right?
[2:47:12] alphazero2k0: hey chat im a diamond and my freind emerald we cant play duo why ?
[2:47:31] Airfire: they're a big fan of talking about anime on EUphoria
[2:47:37] itstotallyamber: It's also like, nothing to do with League
[2:47:46] lec_airport_speedrun: This content is mid give us long form serious content
[2:47:48] itstotallyamber: As funny as it is
[2:47:49] PlzN0: theres not enough days to do content and practice with the new format?
[2:47:50] crispytain: id be worried about one of these bozos burning/cutting their hands
[2:48:07] Airfire: bard
[2:48:07] Rojanosa: Senbna?
[2:48:13] Airfire: and abandon ezreal
[2:48:15] Rojanosa: Karma, bard or senna?
[2:48:20] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[2:48:24] itstotallyamber: @crispytain They 100% probably had a safety briefing lmao
[2:48:46] dwakndwa: It that is playable now, im scared for 14.2
[2:48:48] crispytain: @crispytain '100% probably' lmao
[2:48:55] Airfire: (tbf my answer is always bard and abandon the adc because I love bard)
[2:49:35] itstotallyamber: What a time in life

[2:54:35] itstotallyamber: OMG YES
[2:54:44] lec_airport_speedrun: No
[2:55:06] itstotallyamber: I dunno if you can sort my 'most views' within the channel itself

[2:55:29] NiculaBogdan: Are you still with the gorgeous girl from G2?
[2:55:37] daniellekkk: its sad
[2:55:37] itstotallyamber: wut
[2:55:44] Squallly: jesus christ, hell of a first message
[2:55:45] lec_airport_speedrun: This isn't yamato
[2:55:58] Squallly: (pardon my language)
[2:55:59] daniellekkk: im not into music videos
[2:56:02] Spoodgur: Do they mean that blond girl who talks about taking her breasts out for g2 a lot?
[2:56:04] Spoodgur: or someone else?
[2:56:11] lec_airport_speedrun: Yamato is still with tifa, if that's who you mean
[2:56:13] itstotallyamber: Yamato is still with Tifa, they are engaged now
[2:56:18] KrollV: This also was an absolute banger
[2:56:36] melliphera: Seeing this before seeing the thing it was referencing was an absolute trip
[2:56:46] itstotallyamber: catJAM
[2:56:52] Lullebulle123: damn, I go afk for 20 minutes and this video is what I come back to
[2:57:08] daniellekkk: just do a fortnite dance xdd
[2:57:09] Lullebulle123: Drakos awkward dancing is 10/10
[2:57:20] Faleya: that video is a documentary of the one time someone "accidently" put LSD in the water at LEC :D
[2:57:26] Squallly: the problem is coming up with killer ideas is hard
[2:57:34] dwakndwa: I think a video about LEC winning worlds would bang, just a suggestion tho
[2:57:54] TheHappySocks: You can listen to music multiple times, but most people watch the skits live and that's it
[2:57:58] Lullebulle123: @MedicCasts to be fair, the pop quizes got 7 of my friends into league esports, thats totally worth it Kappa
[2:58:04] Spoodgur: Do you feel Twisted Fate is still viable currently? Kind of want to try to one trick him in low-mid ranks (gold to low diamond or so)
[2:58:04] Szyman90: Song people watch more than one time, other video not
[2:58:06] crispytain: stuff that can show off player personality is super important IMO but it really depends on the player
[2:58:07] itstotallyamber: @TheHappySocks Valid point
[2:58:16] daniellekkk: yeah but i dont think that  algorithm doesnt work like that
[2:58:18] tedehbe: @MedicCasts do you know what froskurin is doing now?
[2:58:30] itstotallyamber: She left esports
[2:58:32] KrollV: LEC Taskmaster could be an absolute contentfest
[2:58:33] itstotallyamber: All I know
[2:58:34] daniellekkk: and its harder to do like you said
[2:59:06] melliphera: Are you considered full time? I have no idea how all of this works, with all the work that must happen behind the scenes
[2:59:13] Faleya: yeah I mean most of those skits are amazing but I watch them on the livestream so I rarely watch them again on yt
[2:59:16] itstotallyamber: He's freelance
[2:59:17] crispytain: I think the views on something like the cooking video are more important than something like a pop quiz
[2:59:29] Squallly: I think Vedi would make an excellent Little Alex Horne :p
[2:59:46] Szyman90: thats why only them making song from this year?

[3:00:53] daniellekkk: that was very good
[3:01:15] Lullebulle123: To be fair, this video was shown during the start of the LEC week
[3:01:56] crispytain: does showing it on broadcast lower the individual video views?
[3:03:13] Lullebulle123: I wish I could forget 2021 ever happened
[3:03:13] Faleya: I miss the "Vedi-Verse" and it's also been too long since the last real "Medi-Vedi" thing
[3:03:27] itstotallyamber: Lest we forget the content piece YOU wrote
[3:03:37] itstotallyamber: That video hit different
[3:03:48] itstotallyamber: The drones one
[3:03:59] itstotallyamber: I thought you said you wrote that
[3:04:28] KrollV: Flexius was the video that got me invested into the LEC again after a few years of not really watching it

[3:22:10] iMeyhoff: Sometimes i feel like, with the amount of champs available that 2 bans per person would make sense

[3:24:43] lec_airport_speedrun: Vlad too???
[3:24:56] Auroxanex_Pendragon: A regular day of solo queue
[3:24:59] lec_airport_speedrun: New meta?
[3:25:01] Laragon: Vlad probably tilted by K6 and quitting.
[3:25:04] lec_airport_speedrun: Never leave base?
[3:25:28] Laragon: I wish people doing it the first month got like a 6 month ban.
[3:25:37] Janseke: sad to see, but comforting that most streamers i watch also have those cursed lobbies and its not just my games
[3:26:12] hooch1scr4zy: I don't remember it being as bad as it is currently. I had 5 games in a row like this

[3:35:12] lec_airport_speedrun: There's a certain clip of you being somewhat happy after we gifted 50bn subs, couple of years ago near Christmas iirc?
[3:35:46] itstotallyamber: He has teared up a couple times
[3:36:02] itstotallyamber: Mika's stream now
[3:36:39] dudeeyy: i recently watched thorin and monte talking about league casters. Have you watched/heard What they said and if so is it true? Sound kinda bad tbh
[3:36:50] itstotallyamber: Selling your baby teeth would be selling a starter item
[3:37:04] TooMuchCoffeePainting: but i have 2 of the same quest item, i certainly dont need 2 kidneys to finish this quest//
[3:37:25] lec_airport_speedrun: Blink twice if riot are holding you hostage rn
[3:37:35] wisebighorn: it was about the Saudi Tournement and if casters would go
[3:37:56] dudeeyy: yea, they hate riot with all their heart and soul
[3:37:58] lec_airport_speedrun: I mean, they can say
[3:38:04] wisebighorn: nah you talked about it on your stream the day before
[3:38:11] itstotallyamber: There's no confirmation they will even join the tourney
[3:38:18] itstotallyamber: Riot that being
[3:38:20] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[3:38:34] lec_airport_speedrun: I'm sure there's a date and all
[3:38:54] lec_airport_speedrun: Apparently rito pencilled the first week of July (iirc) and asked leagues to stop
[3:39:02] crispytain: ward pinged BLANKIES
[3:39:14] itstotallyamber: Yeah they want it free in the event it all goes ahead
[3:39:24] lec_airport_speedrun: And so if you're taking that to be true which I think is reasonable, I do think it's fair to ask questions
[3:39:29] lec_airport_speedrun: But don't be fucking dicks
[3:39:53] itstotallyamber: Myes
[3:40:59] lec_airport_speedrun: Something I do wonder though, does being a prime league div3 sub now make medic right in anything he says
[3:41:05] dudeeyy: Would you be open to do a reflections episode with thorin? i think that would be a good listen 😊
[3:41:35] itstotallyamber: I don't believe so
[3:41:43] lec_airport_speedrun: I suspect the answer would be no, on basis of very very minor philosophical differences
[3:42:11] itstotallyamber: Yeah he's not everyone's cup of tea..
[3:42:18] itstotallyamber: Which is fair
[3:43:06] dudeeyy: I’ve seen the episode with ATLUS and they were good. Just a straight up interview
[3:43:48] itstotallyamber: I believe Laure did an interview also
[3:44:13] itstotallyamber: Like it CAN work, but generally people don't want the drama it often comes with

[3:44:31] itstotallyamber: I dunno
[3:44:45] itstotallyamber: I just assumed it did
[3:44:52] dudeeyy: i can’t find a Laure interview
[3:44:55] itstotallyamber: Didn't know there was drama over that
[3:45:15] lec_airport_speedrun: She announced it and the world kicked up a huge fuss
