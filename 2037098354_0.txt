[0:37:13] Gizan: 1/12 milo
[0:37:19] Grumpmeister: 20 deaths on botlane
[0:37:21] getsometalentloser: @soux_ssb  terminus is the most over rated item ever it’s super situional
[0:37:22] Grumpmeister: Man
[0:37:30] getsometalentloser: cause it takes a long time to stack up
[0:37:31] nwa4lifeTV: 1 death per minute
[0:37:41] getsometalentloser: it’s a 4-5th item option
[0:37:48] getsometalentloser: any earlier is super grief
[0:38:18] soux_ssb: @getsometalentloser how is it situational? isnt it just good for dmg&sustain

[0:47:58] getsometalentloser: when sharing creeps to avoid any penalty
[0:48:01] DuckFeith: has rekkless and friends been doing it?

[1:44:47] kristykat_: lol
[1:44:53] u56828878: windows update and league being bad as per usual seem equally likely
[1:46:10] u56828878: that's super relatable

[2:40:15] madgym02: zed?
[2:40:47] kristykat_: O bruh
[2:40:53] MrChris328: you done got got. lol
[2:42:08] BurritoTX: had a super satisfying game of showing a shako that he was not in fact a good jungler. he did not claim a single objective.
[2:42:46] Quick45: Yeeeepz
[2:43:44] BurritoTX: tank maokai  feels really good. but not as much fun as damage moa last season.
[2:44:27] Quick45: i'm crying so much that sejuani aint good now :/ any play/feel alkies that are good atm?
[2:44:49] grandmakrystal: omg I love the role variety - top now mid?! sheeeeeesh
[2:46:40] grandmakrystal: next game - bot or support 🤣
[2:47:32] DemionDemon: good morning strimar
[2:47:34] Tritros: they’re trying to give shaco kills but he doesn’t want them
[2:50:10] Boh14: My god hes clean with the fox lady
[2:58:30] holytoby: League just hasnt felt like League of Legends this season.  Is it just me or it alot more kill, kill, kill, less objectives and CSing. Not a fan personally.
[3:01:10] DemionDemon: fokkin` nice bruv
[3:01:12] WingedChipmunk: @holytoby HONESTLY, this season feels SOOOO much better to me. Outside of item tuning which is always an issue when new items are implemented, but with more objectives for junlgers, more ways to play new builds for champs.
[3:02:11] holytoby: @WingedChipmunk Are you a jungler too? Im Top lane so it's really flipped the game on its head for me; maybe thats my issue... Im either 0/0 when there are 30 kills elsewhere or the flip side.
[3:02:25] AndeGaup: Happy friday!
[3:02:42] holytoby: @WingedChipmunk Not complaining just getting opinions.
[3:04:32] holytoby: Agreed; its been 50/50. Either you get a gank early because the laner messes up and your jungler is a god. Or you get punish and wish you full cleared.
[3:05:16] Boh14: Watching Santorin watch T1 watch Caedrel 5Head
[3:05:17] MrChris328: oh shit. you won that Ahri game??

[3:08:00] Offsette7: trueeee real pain
[3:08:08] Offsette7: spain
[3:08:12] Offsette7: Kappa
[3:08:51] solidussovis: That is the most annoying part. Laners are going to complain for you to come early to gank and win for them, and then flame and complain when you die since laners are so far ahead immediately
[3:09:05] Offsette7: GIGACHAD
[3:09:53] solidussovis: He is military they probably can't show face or voice for legal/ security reasons
[3:10:41] solidussovis: like a former mob boss ratting on 60 min

[3:17:49] Tro11H4rd: hey santorin are ad bruisers still good in the current meta
[3:18:21] mkramer2000: Sometimes. I either 1 v 9 or I'm 3 being 9 v 1 xD
[3:18:43] PigeonSenti: you'd probably like Arctic Monkey's music a lot
[3:19:34] 444Kanin: damn that sucks.
[3:19:36] mkramer2000: Bronze games are just so volatile
[3:19:47] Calvinleeboi: what's the khazix build?
[3:20:12] 444Kanin: hubris is pretty good rn
[3:20:24] DemionDemon: just do the xin build
[3:20:32] 444Kanin: ive been taking hubris over yomuus on graves i like it
[3:20:36] mkramer2000: Well everyone is just build8ng a support item so might as well build a support item Kappa
[3:21:02] Calvinleeboi: this high elo khazix one trick goes profane hydra into seryldas
[3:21:08] Calvinleeboi: is that good?
[3:21:21] DemionDemon: i mean. W evolve into jump into auto-attack seems pretty experimental
[3:21:34] DemionDemon: with hydra
[3:22:15] gtkhazix: @Calvinleeboi matchup depending if its a farming game you always profane 1st if not its 2nd after hubris
[3:22:32] Calvinleeboi: i see
[3:22:53] passing_d: dont worry Sylas got the castor minion
[3:22:55] gtkhazix: usually better to serylda 3rd, only time i go serylda 2nd is against hecarim for the slow
[3:22:57] criticala: Why have I never stumbled upon your stream until now??? My favorite pro jungle player <3

[3:24:55] mkramer2000: There's a fun way to get by ads without ad block lol
[3:25:18] mkramer2000: But it still counts the ad for the streamer
[3:26:40] criticala: Damn that was not gentle
[3:26:58] Dezrunner: 10 mio enemies, thats kinda unfair teams
[3:28:23] Tritros: why did you not evolve q first
[3:28:34] mkramer2000: I can't believe they didn't take the last voidgrub
[3:29:49] Tritros: ok because I don’t play kahzix so was wondering
[3:30:30] gtkhazix: hubris is only good as 1st item, like mejai 1st on eve, no idea going as 2nd, and voltaic is flat damage so its useless after 3 items basically
[3:30:46] ninzo: why voltaic cyclosword instead if orifabe hydra
[3:30:55] solidussovis: first evolve ult? what have i missed
[3:32:20] solidussovis: that makes sense vs trynd
[3:33:08] nwa4lifeTV: delusional trynd
[3:33:19] Tritros: all trynd players are delusional

[3:43:26] Apex_LeVraiJoe: and it actiavates when receiving a stack for 90 seconds
[3:43:31] Apex_LeVraiJoe: you have 41 stacks
