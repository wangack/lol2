[0:41:02] RealRezil: lol
[0:41:04] balletbunny: BRUHFAINT
[0:41:09] 9fierce9: that is embarrasing
[0:41:16] aka_eliya: ohno
[0:41:18] GrandeLink: oh fod this guy has no mental
[0:41:19] Lionhardt544: Holy shit that match history
[0:41:21] Sayieh: ggs. sorry about that game
[0:41:24] IC__SubiX: one trick bot not
[0:41:25] Blisdon_: BRUHFAINT
[0:41:41] imtehForest: I missed the end of that game
[0:41:46] imtehForest: did u lose in tyhe end
[0:41:47] mercurial1o1: Could never be me on my main sadge
[0:41:47] Sayieh: that hoplite offer was real btw. you should play!!!
[0:41:51] imtehForest: ah yes
[0:41:56] RealRezil: whats up with 2 support items is that the new meta? @5up
[0:42:00] ewwii_damncat: i thought you had this game won 5 minutes ago, I guess I dont really understand league yet
[0:42:11] Sayieh: its ok we win trust...
[0:42:16] imtehForest: that's so broken
[0:42:21] Sayieh: anyway gl in next. was a surprise seeeing you lol
[0:42:34] ewwii_damncat: first game doesnt count 5up7
[0:42:41] hughjanus9001: buying double support item on 1st item is bad?
[0:43:46] IC__SubiX: but that gold thing was possible before. It just did no dmg
[0:44:41] umaiii_: how did they fuck up this badly so now that the adc is better off starting support item LUL
[0:45:07] p_s___: it also gives more passibve gold now than s13
[0:45:13] RealRezil: I remember couple seasons back when running twitch/janna   top with support item used to be so broken they had change the support item
[0:45:30] mercurial1o1: China also does it with top jg sometimes
[0:45:36] umaiii_: @RealRezil yeah and now they went back to support items being broken...
[0:46:35] p_s___: heard of a game with 4 support items and mid went smite LUL
[0:46:54] IC__SubiX: i saw a youtube video like 5 month ago and they did it. but since you need it as first item you cant push as adc, and have no lane prio. If the other team playes around bot early you loose, if not you gain a gold lead
[0:47:30] its_taurus_season: do you think you'll ever play phasmophobia again?
[0:47:35] IC__SubiX: yes true, but the idea is the same
[0:47:51] itsthenars: oh man i love phas
[0:47:58] umaiii_: did they remove the gold lowering when u farm with a supp item?
[0:49:30] mercurial1o1: Time for perfection
[0:49:39] Jules_vdc: @p_s___ you mean the 2 1 2 comp with asol mid?
[0:50:09] ewwii_damncat: i havent heard this song in forever I forgot it existed

[1:13:13] itsthenars: bard: there can only be one artistic champion this game
[1:13:42] umaiii_: sona: am i a joke to u
[1:13:53] Carnavious: herald just give syou empowered recall even after using
[1:14:00] hughjanus9001: new scuttle probably does something fancy there
[1:14:09] IC__SubiX: jgl keeps fast tp after herald
[1:14:25] IC__SubiX: 1 time use
[1:15:18] Littlex04: Which League char is your fav 5up ?
[1:15:41] Mycotic: @umaiii_ yeah I only play 5s pretty much
[1:15:52] itsthenars: he REALLY wanted to beef with Yi LUL
[1:15:59] Mycotic: Graves
[1:16:20] umaiii_: ohhh speaking of kindred did u see the new cinematic

[1:18:34] Lionhardt544: My understanding on Naafiri is that if you want to play an AD Assassin in mid lane, you're better off just playing Talon. You only play Naafiri if you like her

[1:28:03] AkitaAttribute: I didn't enjoy Pony Island as much as Inscryption.
[1:28:03] XortedI: watch this yi absulutly throw this game

[1:29:34] divax0x0: Minecraft is a game you need to be in the mood to play
[1:29:41] itsthenars: totally believable, considering im obsessed with decked out rn lmaooo
[1:29:47] Jules_vdc: so true
[1:29:58] MariiWotterii: legends of runeterra? don't know if it's your thing
[1:30:05] hughjanus9001: me personally i would only watch mcc xd more of a competitive watcher
[1:30:12] Jules_vdc: in general transforming mc viewers to variety viewers is really difficult
[1:30:21] mercurial1o1: Minecraft was so lit but i burnt myself out more than rumble could ever
[1:30:22] aka_eliya: oh yes the community is kind of horrible but i feel like its diff w/ the vh community but i get it yea

[1:33:51] itsthenars: chill is great for stream though imo lmao
[1:34:18] balletbunny: i’ve only found one mc youtuber that doesnt yell LOL so hard
[1:34:50] divax0x0: I think if you want mc YouTube content you need a group that's just always entertaining and they don't need to be good
[1:35:09] MariiWotterii: yeah chill is great for stream cause people just leave it on in the background, for youtube it's meh
[1:35:15] S4uc3y__: yo do you fw Travis Scott

[1:38:50] EnmaTheKingOfHell: You´re ranked Master»
[1:39:00] divax0x0: Hi
[1:39:06] EnmaTheKingOfHell: What´s your advice for main supports?
[1:39:23] aka_eliya: hi sig Aloo
[1:40:00] imtehForest: EZ
[1:40:21] FrozenLavaReflector: WP sir
[1:40:22] divax0x0: He played with fire and died
[1:40:24] kittendropz: tooooo EZ
[1:40:52] EnmaTheKingOfHell: Not worth?
[1:41:41] aka_eliya: lol
[1:41:49] EnmaTheKingOfHell: Do you think it´s possible to get to higher ranks just by playing support?
[1:42:11] hughjanus9001: @EnmaTheKingOfHell fs support hard tho
[1:42:14] hughjanus9001: to carry
[1:42:29] hughjanus9001: but if you're better consistently you will rank up
[1:42:31] EnmaTheKingOfHell: Makes a lot of sense, actually. Thank you for the advice
[1:42:44] EnmaTheKingOfHell: @hughjanus9001 True! I know how it is
[1:42:46] hughjanus9001: so like 70% wr is not realistic
[1:42:54] itsthenars: you should probably learn another position, when i played ages ago i knew how to top jung and supp and played mid when i wanted to troll people
[1:43:17] EnmaTheKingOfHell: @hughjanus9001 Thank you so much for your advice as well
[1:43:26] 9fierce9: I was wondering where that cartoony sound came from KEKW
[1:43:26] EnmaTheKingOfHell: @itsthenars Yes, i may give it a try
[1:43:39] 9fierce9: Thought something was auto playing on my computer
[1:44:01] EnmaTheKingOfHell: The thing with support is that one becomes a lot more dependent on the other teammates
[1:44:26] itsthenars: find a supp that isnt so dependent then
[1:44:27] EnmaTheKingOfHell: It´s just that i don´t wanna be forcing playing in another role
[1:44:30] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[1:44:47] EnmaTheKingOfHell: True, actually
[1:44:50] itsthenars: i know i 1v1'd a warrick at one point when i played soraka, i was deadly with them bananas
[1:44:58] hughjanus9001: @EnmaTheKingOfHell supports like pyke or senna can snowball easily but ofcourse if your adc runs it down its harder aswell
[1:45:06] IC__SubiX: i would sugest keep an eye on your jgl'er and start roaming if you think they need help, dont wait for them to ping for help
[1:45:26] EnmaTheKingOfHell: @hughjanus9001 yuniiNOTED
