[3:40:15] SpectrumRush: yes
[3:40:25] mainlyuseless: It feels more like Spectrum's attachment to Kanye is likely based on a time in their life when the music meant the most to them.

[3:41:21] Nindrone: ur allowed to like Kanye i just think the putting them up against each other is just bad
[3:41:22] SpectrumRush: @menardiiii Hey man he did SOME good things you know
[3:41:24] mainlyuseless: @SpectrumRush exactly why the argue of "who the goat is" becomes irrelevant. It's an entirely subjective conversation
