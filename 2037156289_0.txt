[0:18:36] faakiecs: Detdert flamed him as usual, and then he wrote back a response "REFUGEE WELFARE" not that bad, but he kept doubling down on the fact that his parents arent from Denmark but turkey
[0:19:29] vetluza: @wildriftboi1 was it good  ?

[0:49:10] dea1hwish: is where 2 heretics roasters? with you and other with jankos?
[0:49:11] riot_kappapride: Is aphelios still so strong after the hotfix?

[0:51:11] MikuChan1998: zwyroo also didnt get an ult off in the final fight
[0:51:14] MikuChan1998: but it didnt matter
[0:51:30] megau7: @riot_kappapride x2, since i start watching jack i just go from gold to emerald 1 in two split
[0:53:43] Mani1624: can you try senna adc?
[0:53:43] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr

[0:54:22] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream? Follow me on other platforms for more content! https://linktr.ee/jackspektra
[0:54:27] riot_kappapride: Do you still use the same rotation with aphelios weapons, like use the red gun first the first 2 times?
[0:54:28] Wetru: perfect base
[0:54:29] MikuChan1998: lethality max?
[0:55:30] chatarraburrida: U should start playing w some hándicaps on Superliga and post It on youtube
[0:56:09] rejnes4: so what is most important thing on aphelios
[0:56:15] riot_kappapride: How do you fix your rotation, i fuck it up most of the time caus i dont know the theory behind it
[0:56:20] MikuChan1998: have you seen the insane Karma and Ezreal buffs? @Jackspektra Riot smoking something
[0:56:31] Baltamutus: you dont buy potions because u have sustain with milio and red gun into a 0 poking lane? @Jackspektra
[0:56:33] dea1hwish: why not maxing q? why now go into e? @jackspektra
[0:56:53] MikuChan1998: red/green**
[0:57:02] megau7: make sense
[0:57:03] rejnes4: NOTED
[0:57:14] dea1hwish: oh, okay, thank you
[0:57:25] kvothe142001: espero que vuelvas pronto a la lec, te sigo desde el betis me hiciste muy feliz y te sigo siempre
[0:57:30] schnoepsy: so now you max e q w?
[0:57:39] megau7: NOTED
[0:58:27] megau7: now you need to fix purple too no?
[0:59:06] riot_kappapride: How should vayne play then? I often have the problem when i dont have range for example as vayne janna vs cait lux, how sohuld i play this lane
[0:59:38] megau7: nice
[0:59:40] Amir_isM2: wp
[0:59:44] fencebarcode: clean with it
[0:59:48] zainji: u are the goat jack
[0:59:50] zainji: good luck in lvp
[1:00:09] Vaiang: @riot_kappapride dorans shield and pray enemy bot is shit
[1:00:16] MikuChan1998: i think they're kinda busted tbh
[1:00:22] Baltamutus: I think rift herald has low value now tbh
[1:00:25] xcalebur: theyre giga over valued
[1:00:31] rejnes4: it depend on team comp i feel like
[1:00:40] xcalebur: like wow u got an extra 200dmg on that tower crazy
[1:01:32] schnoepsy: i just turned on the stream, could you explain why you go stormrazer over kraken this game?
[1:02:01] mono_brown: kind of makes sense that the topside objective is good for the splitpusher lane,
[1:02:23] mono_brown: since toplane can go take just 1 if they are mega winning top
[1:02:39] Vaiang: i think its good if objectives are situational
[1:02:51] Vaiang: higher skill expression from picking which ones u want to fight for
[1:03:13] riot_kappapride: It feels much stronger as jgl to path Top to bot and 2nd full clear you just trade drake for grubs, and you can contest 2nd grubs if needed. What you think
[1:03:15] Vaiang: it kinda doesnt have a point if drake is just better than everything else tho
[1:03:26] megau7: when you have purple and blue what gun you drop
[1:03:32] xParra23: Hey guys
[1:03:33] megau7: because i drop purple
[1:03:42] mono_brown: makes sense that dragons are the "teamfighting" objective, where as grubs and herald are the "map pressure" objectives, so identifying what your team comp wants is a skill

[2:23:41] 365Doors: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Hubris
[2:23:49] guzuzu1: @365Doors do u lose the stacks if u die or smth?

[2:26:06] MikuChan1998: Shaco needs an ASU
[2:26:19] MikuChan1998: Or a VGU
[2:26:24] 365Doors: @365Doors the statue isnt actually kill either. it's just takedown
[2:26:59] Goldstrike36: it evolves on takedowns aswell ? didnt know
[2:27:14] 365Doors: yea riot doesnt want us to actually know how items work
