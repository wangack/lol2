[1:00:04] Azmod3ous: it popped
[1:00:07] PontiffYves: and she's not even behind. Thats the alarming part
[1:00:17] TyrTheTiny: time to build heartsteel lux again
[1:00:22] Azmod3ous: that's the insane thing
[1:00:23] JimmyBigmoney: AND it's busted on invis champs
[1:00:29] arcadedani: yeah...and it doesn't matter if you are fed or no as an adc you are going to suffer
[1:00:40] homantic: evelynn can just q & e and ur done for
[1:00:53] AzogDaAussie: it's preseason, hopefully some major item balance patches will come soon
[1:00:55] antiqueangvl: shaco needs to be changed, theres just no counter play to him
[1:01:06] antiqueangvl: if he gets behind you thats it its so annoying
[1:01:10] liobanil: Hi KP and basement
[1:01:14] arcadedani: fr adc has been the worst lane for the past season riot really hate us
[1:01:19] Azmod3ous: preseason doesn't exsist anymore
[1:01:21] S17Master: I think there needs to be just some form of counterplay to invisibility
[1:01:36] PontiffYves: @homantic Another day of thanking god that I still havent had an Eve in my enemy team.

[1:02:22] PontiffYves: The main damage dealers that werent even behind are getting clapped within seconds into the teamfight.
[1:02:25] arcadedani: @PontiffYves Aatrox one hit and there goes your life
[1:02:38] pavel5562: heeey how are you
[1:02:50] Azmod3ous: when my buddy is faced with being one shot like that he always gets frozen heart it's super cheap rn gives haste mana and armor :D
[1:02:57] Leaskk: preach on tha
[1:02:57] arcadedani: same whit Jax...
[1:02:58] Leaskk: that
[1:03:03] pavel5562: @Darkcyter sumSuh
[1:03:12] Ripulpos: my fav lux element
[1:03:12] arcadedani: and is because of ONE FREAKING item
[1:03:14] meep_: I watched an Aatrox go like 1/5 early game then end the game 19/7 or something
[1:03:21] mrsparkei: helloo, happy friday everyone, happy weekend, love you all!!! lets share some love
[1:03:22] Azmod3ous: @Chuito102 It's still an item
[1:03:22] antiqueangvl: the first games of the season i played i was going against nocturne and oh my god
[1:03:42] Darkcyter: @pavel5562 kaypHello
[1:03:44] PontiffYves: Lmao Singed players remind me of Karthus players. "Dying is my kit."
[1:03:49] Darkcyter: @mrsparkei kaypHello
[1:04:10] ObsceneSanity: Aatrox had sundered sky
[1:04:11] backstreetalright: hey kp, how are games
[1:04:23] arcadedani: @ObsceneSanity that item is HELL
[1:04:25] CaramellCat: Good afternoon everyone! kaypArrive
[1:04:28] DoctaBones: cause of healing
[1:04:38] ObsceneSanity: it gives 150% of dmg done as heals
[1:04:41] DoctaBones: if he has people to hit that are fresh there is a large heal
[1:04:44] PontiffYves: I doubt oblivion orb could do anything against that item
[1:04:55] Azmod3ous: in regards to the aatrox I feel like there needs to be a cap on his omnivamp even darius gets a a max heal of 3 champs hit.
[1:04:58] CocaInteriores: curious question. Isn't stormsurge really op as an early item?
[1:04:59] DoctaBones: he could theoretically proc it 5 times in row
[1:05:02] PontiffYves: I doubt oblivion orb could do anything against any healing method if im being honest
[1:05:15] slothlane: it also feels like heal reduction doesn't do much?
[1:05:17] choicrisu: heal redution doesnt rly work this season tbh
[1:05:20] antiqueangvl: heal reduction isn't even that good i feel
[1:05:22] choicrisu: reduction*
[1:05:31] TyrTheTiny: the amount of times I have built heal reduction just for it to do nothing
[1:05:39] PontiffYves: is the bruisers healing reduction better than mages?
[1:05:48] PontiffYves: Because morello never did anything to me
[1:06:01] ObsceneSanity: heal reduct against a single champ seems best early game, but late game it doesn‚Äôt stack so it seems useless
[1:06:07] silentButDadly: Oh wow, I don't think I knew that Gwen's W made her immune from something like Malphite's ult
[1:06:13] arcadedani: sundered sky gives him 150% of dmg done heal it means that if he hits you he is going to heal a lot and if he doesnt need the heal then the item gives him life points
[1:06:17] pavel5562: how was yesterday - i missed the photos cuz i was at the theater
[1:06:20] Tabster1TV: kaypHello @Darkcyter
[1:06:25] PontiffYves: @ObsceneSanity Explains why korean challengers always buy the orb first item after backing
[1:06:30] Azmod3ous: @PontiffYves no it has a grievous wounds passive that reduces healing by 40% regardless
[1:06:46] lima234234: ~!rank
[1:06:48] lima234234: !rank
[1:06:48] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/multisearch/euw?summoners=No+Cannon+No+Cry%23pea%2CKarma+Pengu
[1:06:53] arcadedani: is ridiculous...i already saw a Jax whit that item, an Aatrox whit that item and a Nocturne...total nightmares
[1:06:55] PontiffYves: @Azmod3ous Oh, ty ty
[1:06:55] Azmod3ous: @PontiffYves Even bramble gives 40%
[1:06:59] DoctaBones: @kaypea The bonus health gained from Lightshield Strike can stack with subsequent triggers of the effect.      This can only stack up to 5 times and the duration is refreshed each time the heal is in excess of 100% maximum health.
[1:06:59] savethebeets: savethebeets subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! kaypHelloÔøº kaypComfy
[1:07:00] Darkcyter: @Tabster1TV kaypHello
[1:07:10] Azmod3ous: @PontiffYves ofc :D
[1:07:17] ObsceneSanity: @pontiffyves if you‚Äôre laning against a healing champ if you don‚Äôt get heal reduction first item you‚Äôre making your lane hard/ inting
[1:07:21] Darkcyter: @savethebeets kaypHYPERS WB
[1:07:24] Darkcyter: @ObsceneSanity kaypHello
[1:07:35] Azmod3ous: @PontiffYves the problem is just so many champs have an insane amount of healing its like what's the point lol
[1:07:56] antiqueangvl: it sucks because your singed is inting into him and its just impossible to kill him even if you or the rest of your team isnt behind
[1:08:24] S17Master: @Azmod3ous Shout out to the game where my team was 4v1 fighting a Mundo, two of us had GW items, and he still outhealed our combined damage
[1:08:35] PontiffYves: @Azmod3ous Exactly my point..Whats more busted is the healing in aram. Nothing works as well its insane
[1:08:36] ObsceneSanity: all your singed had to do was just proxy farm and run when aatrox chased. but he fought him every time.
[1:08:46] arcadedani: Kayle is a good counter for him
[1:09:01] TyrTheTiny: question, what kind of champ uses cryptobloom? that item sounds interesting but I have never seen anyone use it and I can't think of a single champ that needs it
[1:09:08] PontiffYves: @ObsceneSanity Singed and Karthus never back away. "Dying is my kit" Is their motto
[1:09:19] arcadedani: ...poor caitlyn dude
[1:09:26] PontiffYves: what the hell was even that
[1:09:30] ObsceneSanity: lol I guess so
[1:09:30] Azmod3ous: @S17Master i played a xin game yesterday and I felt like his healing is busted and I went straight bruiser no healing items just health and spirit visage
[1:09:54] arcadedani: she literally dissapear
[1:10:04] PontiffYves: Cait will be questioning her whole league journey
[1:10:17] PontiffYves: She's even supposed to be a mobile adc LMAO
[1:10:29] Azmod3ous: @TyrTheTiny I've used it on sylas it's good for a short sustain burst to keep you in the fight
[1:11:03] kreumbly: @KayPea I know you and other people are happy about mage items but i honestly cant wait for them to get nerfed. Had a lvl 11 lux support in one of my games with supp item and stormsurge item that did 70% of my hp with just her E
[1:11:16] babyhydra: omg gwen
[1:11:22] babyhydra: died so fast too
[1:11:24] Hollow_CS: holy cow, thats a massively fed shaco
[1:11:25] plaugecat: well you wasted the sheild in zyonas
[1:11:25] Waterhead30: That was kinda stupid from Gwen
[1:11:30] Natalia3123: how is this champ even fair?
[1:11:39] PontiffYves: It's bizarre how this game changed our whole happy mood..
[1:11:39] charlotte__sz: shaco is one of the worst characters in the game
[1:11:42] charlotte__sz: like how is this balanced
[1:11:46] arcadedani: @Natalia3123 he is not xD
[1:11:47] charlotte__sz: how are u supposed to counter play it
[1:11:50] ObsceneSanity: assassins are eating this wipe bc one shots are back on the board.
[1:11:53] Azmod3ous: @kreumbly Stormsurge was strong and the support item is hella strong
[1:12:10] Waterhead30: Stormsurge getting nerfed next patch
[1:12:10] arcadedani: worst season for adc again
[1:12:14] JimmyBigmoney: playing a mage support is playing on easy mode
[1:12:16] TyrTheTiny: I fucking hate shaco, the fact that he can dissapear with low CD, his disappearence is also a short dash. so dumb
[1:12:48] Azmod3ous: @KayPea I agree with the supp item i played xerath support earlier this week and felt like i did no dmg until my supp quest was complete then i was one shotting the enemy adc
[1:12:49] Natalia3123: @arcadedani ye xd he appears out of nowhere and oneshots u like wtf
[1:12:51] DeclinedElk: nooo don't nerf my support champs. i'm having fun again. (i hate mages that go support tho)
[1:12:51] KingPatissier: And that might happen again with Karma's huge buff lol.
[1:13:00] kreumbly: Honestly yeah the mage supp item is really strong but honestly the new mage items in general are just super strong. stormsurge mage item and the ult CDR item is disgusting
[1:13:01] anamaria23a: hello lovelyüëãüèª
[1:13:05] Byggareebob: maybe they want mages to be in the botlane and midlane to be something else
[1:13:12] pavel5562: how was yesterday - i missed the photos cuz i was at the theater Û†ÄÄ
[1:13:23] Azmod3ous: @KayPea I literally had no other item completed.
[1:13:23] scardad: @Azmod3ous xerath is my support perma ban ngl
[1:13:27] PontiffYves: The only frustrating memory I have is Morgana with Liandry. she doesnt only cc but takes half your hp. i think she got nerfed as I dont see that damage happening anymore
[1:13:41] DoctaBones: @KayPea you tried malignance as your mana regen item on lux for the weird ult stuff it does some extra damage and ult haste ... just curious?
[1:13:47] Azmod3ous: @scardad for me it depends on what champ i play lol
[1:13:51] madalinO2: kaypFlower kaypVibe kaypHappea kaypHarmony Û†ÄÄ
[1:13:52] kreumbly: The problem is the only real broken supp item is the mage one. the rest are good and equal in value to a normal item.
[1:14:00] CocaInteriores: @anamaria23a You have my mothers name kaypCozy
[1:14:06] PontiffYves: @Azmod3ous Guys you dont ban hooking champs in bot?
[1:14:19] arcadedani: i am going to say it items for every lane are fine but the ones for adc's? hello riot??? HELLOOO xD they dont care about adc role, everything one shots an adc and is stupid
[1:14:23] Azmod3ous: @kreumbly I don't agree the ad one is hella strong too
[1:14:33] sovitiaisavampire: guys i think kp wants to nerf everyone's items, everyone but mages, idk why Keepo
[1:14:35] Hollow_CS: support item giving damage is dumb idea in itself
[1:14:53] CocaInteriores: @PontiffYves Hell no, that's the only time someone grabs me KEKW
[1:14:53] PontiffYves: CAITLYN
[1:14:54] pavel5562: sumGG
[1:14:57] PontiffYves: she was mad
[1:14:58] scardad: @Azmod3ous If I'm playing morg, definitely not because of my shield. However I'm also just better at dodging that then xerath's stuff
[1:14:59] pavel5562: sumEZ
[1:15:01] QueenKymo: aaaayyyy
[1:15:03] savethebeets: kaypCheer
[1:15:07] TyrTheTiny: cait fighting for her LIFE
[1:15:14] arcadedani: yes caitlyn!!!! <3
[1:15:16] kreumbly: @Azmod3ous nah, its equal to a normal damage item, which is the intent for it. the mage item can do 15-20% of someones hp
[1:15:23] arcadedani: @TyrTheTiny xD literally
[1:15:28] DoctaBones: @KayPea i dont play mages dunno lol was just curious it looks interesting
[1:15:29] PontiffYves: Caitlyn is truly an mvp
[1:15:38] plaugecat: what do you think the sup item does
[1:15:41] mentalfordaayz: mentalfordaayz converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[1:15:47] DeclinedElk: Kaypea is targeting me. >:(
[1:15:53] JimmyBigmoney: pyke made supports egotistic
[1:15:57] Hollow_CS: @KayPea why the hell do we even have support items give damage ? its such a dumb idea
[1:16:06] ObsceneSanity: support shaco is stronger than any other shaco :)
[1:16:06] mentalfordaayz: Hey Kels, how's it going?? Sorry wasnt really active on past 2 weeks, I lost my lovely kitty Nyx. She had FIP disease - wet one. You know she was family to me and it is quite hard to be okay after you lost family but I'm feeling better already hanging out in basement with you and chat, so thanks for that kaypComfy
[1:16:17] PontiffYves: That game, even though you won, screwed your mood. Thats what I hate about league..
[1:16:19] arcadedani: you are supposed to be like helpful dmg not doing more dmg than the saying assasin or mage in the team xD
[1:16:19] merisee: I play support and mostly zyra, And lot of the times her damage is stupid high
[1:16:21] ForbiddenDakota: @Hollow_CS bc dmg supports like lux, velkoz etc
[1:16:21] akimonkey: it's true. everytime I play zyra sup, i do more damage than mage mid which is supposed to be illegal tbh
[1:16:22] babyhydra: they are getting nerfed in like 4 days afaik
[1:16:22] TyrTheTiny: @ObsceneSanity you deserve jailtime
[1:16:30] plaugecat: wait but for real what do you think the sup item does
[1:16:33] kreumbly: I honestly feel like the only supports that do a bunch of damage is the supports that are meant to do damage.
[1:16:38] Divaleta: I must be building the wrong things cause I am doing negative damage in game üòÇ
[1:16:39] DeclinedElk: tbh i haven't noticed. i don't play dmg supports. i play tanks or enchanters.
[1:16:49] S17Master: @Divaleta Same
[1:16:54] ObsceneSanity: @tyrthetiny the lethality support item is instance
[1:16:57] ObsceneSanity: insane*
[1:17:06] Waterhead30: I dont knoe about y'all but im enjoying tanks so much with new items
[1:17:06] CipherAdminShady: Support Zyra/VelKoz enters chat
[1:17:09] NoPainNoDane: im taking you for a 3am trip to get mcdonalds on my phone kaypea :)
[1:17:11] Byggareebob: they dont build less dmg they just have less gold
[1:17:21] Hollow_CS: @ForbiddenDakota yea those champs dont belong to that role at all, they give nothing but damage, its such a fucked up logic
[1:17:23] ItsKxz3: Zyra the DPS queen
[1:17:25] FiraaTurk: wait.. was that you just singing?
[1:17:34] AzogDaAussie: zyra's been a blight on bot lane for several seasons tbh
[1:17:35] plaugecat: but it always was thats not new to this season
[1:17:41] kreumbly: Champs that their roles isnt set to only a support or tank role. champs like Senna, Xerath, Lux and Zyra are meant to do damage cause they are labeled as "marksman" or "mage" so they want them to do that damage
[1:17:44] let_james_play: Teemo support is a killer right now with how much dmage he pumps out
[1:17:45] meep_: I do agree with you as a support main, we shouldn't be doing damage, we're there for healing and shielding and cc. However, I will say that it also feels like people don't notice us in the game unless we're doing a ton of damage or our healing is busted or whatever kaypLurk
[1:17:48] ObsceneSanity: I just accepted that we can‚Äôt think support is supposed to be a weak role anymore
[1:17:55] spellbinder1989: being an eve main finally feels good to play
[1:18:00] AnnieePlays: hello everyone! I‚Äôm back yet again kaypFreya
[1:18:01] kristykat_: I come back and ur 2-0 letsgooo
[1:18:04] EverPeacat: In that case can you build support item mid? Lol
[1:18:09] bigtibbyleia: I think complaining about support is kinda like you are getting outplayed by the support. because if you don‚Äôt get hit by the support cc you‚Äôre not going to die. supports deserve to have fun in this game too. we also get one shot (even the tanky ones half the time)
[1:18:11] mentalfordaayz: Thank you kaypLove
[1:18:15] fuujioka: Didnt  u see that T1 played a LCK match with 2 support √≠tems in the botlane and stomp the game? NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:18:18] PontiffYves: After seeing the cinematic, I want a new champion, that is Morgana herself but the past her using her swords. I wonder when League is going to introduce the same champions but different kits.
[1:18:36] kristykat_: this season feels weird
[1:18:36] kreumbly: But i know that if I as a supp main goes into a lane and see a lux or a xerath, i know that I will lose rn cause the mage items are so broken
[1:18:42] arcadedani: the only "weak" role rn is adc :) we literally dont exist for riot
[1:18:44] AnnieePlays: it‚Äôs been so long since I catch a stream kaypLunaRage
[1:18:48] DoctaBones: @KayPea dunno if its good but the lazers tho ... Hatefog: Dealing ability damage to enemy champions with your ultimate ability creates a 250 ‚àí 550 (based on ultimate's damage instance) radius scorched zone beneath them for 3 seconds, applying a Curse to enemies within that deals „Äå 15 (+ 1.5% AP) magic damage every 0.25 seconds „Äç and reduces their magic resistance by 6 ‚àí 12 (based on your level).
[1:18:48] kaliwanss: hellooooü§çü§ç
[1:18:49] Azmod3ous: @fuujioka That's getting nerfed soon
[1:19:06] Hollow_CS: dmg champ being in a support role should give up damge for support item, its nonexistent now
[1:19:06] PontiffYves: @bigtibbyleia That made no sense.. lol
[1:19:17] DoctaBones: @KayPea say it like this you are too poor to be hitting so hard
[1:19:17] DeclinedElk: I do concede that you have a good point Kaypea. Xerath, Brand, Lux, Zyra are disgusting.
[1:19:19] Aneke: But zyra si a glass cannon like lux or brand, u miss a cc and u are dead
[1:19:22] arcadedani: xD i love to play adc and mid lane but...
[1:19:22] TyrTheTiny: I want supports to be supports! riot nerfed soraka and lulu top and sona mid. but they don't care about maged and bruisers support? they can do the changed but they don't want too. I want my supports to be utility champs instead of just another damage dealer.
[1:19:33] JimmyBigmoney: supports are supports, not carries
[1:19:34] kristykat_: truers
[1:19:38] plaugecat: why do you think that
[1:19:44] briikachu: we just gotta make champs like syndra whose stacking system makes her sucky as a support DinoDance
[1:19:45] ataraxia78: Hello Hello, How are you KP this fine day?
[1:19:54] Klaaaaaax: mindf
[1:19:57] FollowMyFolly: midlaner should take support items Kappa
[1:20:01] StTimmy: happy Friday friend!
[1:20:04] Hollow_CS: @KayPea being able to get support item should be a tradeoff of damage for those champs
[1:20:07] Aneke: Ppl forget yassuo, yone, tal√≥n exist
[1:20:14] xokaypea: ooooo big puppy stretch
[1:20:20] jakabolta: ye i just player soraka and her heal felt minimal and than play lux and just pop evryone
[1:20:27] PontiffYves: They nerfed all of the enchantresses to be solely support. And then they dipped lmao
[1:20:28] arcadedani: yeah that's the reason for people taking MAGES out of midlane and going supp because you ended up doing way more dmg as a support
[1:20:43] plaugecat: the sup item does not help them one shot tho
[1:20:47] Hollow_CS: like many times, ap mage support is more threat in botlane than adc xd
[1:20:52] QTwinkyyy: QTwinkyyy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 19 amazing months with the best streamer ever! We wish for the riot gods to bless us with good games kaypHarmony
[1:20:53] ataraxia78: I truly think that the issue lies in the items not the champs/lane
[1:20:53] Azmod3ous: @jakabolta even with the support healing item?
[1:20:56] kreumbly: i mean, rn people are taking the supp item in mid or top lane
[1:21:01] DoctaBones: @KayPea might get worse saw a T1 game this morning where lucian and support started the support item
[1:21:09] briikachu: us mid laners are in shambles rn
[1:21:12] ObsceneSanity: league needs to start showing acquired gold with each champ bc you‚Äôll see that the champ that‚Äôs behind likely has more gold
[1:21:14] AnnieePlays: @jakabolta I know! she‚Äôs my main and it felt like I didn‚Äôt even healed anything!
[1:21:14] kreumbly: they are getting it and roaming with it so they get the mage supp item cause its so broken rn
[1:21:20] TyrTheTiny: riot hates mages, now people will only play assasins mid
[1:21:24] dawneee020: Ahhhhhh I'm going to enjoy this short period of power. Supp wasn't so fun for a while
[1:21:33] Gossamer_DT: @KayPea sounds like it time to switch to a Support role :D
[1:21:44] PontiffYves: Have you guys seen Heimer botlane? his turrets just deletes us before the fight even begins LOL
[1:21:46] kellz30: What do u think about map changes as well?
[1:21:53] arcadedani: @TyrTheTiny xD riot only loves tank i am convince of that since the last 5 or 4 seasons
[1:21:59] plaugecat: but do you know why tho
[1:22:07] Me1kMan: 5Head
[1:22:16] AnnieePlays: it is the supp item is broken
[1:22:20] Hollow_CS: didnt first rank on EUNE play double supp items? xD
[1:22:24] saiefe: its broken but depends how good u are
[1:22:26] Just_a_PixeI: The double support item should've been hotfixed day 1 to be honest..
[1:22:27] saiefe: :D
[1:22:31] sovitiaisavampire: the new support items havent affected me, thats mostly because i dont play league Keepo
[1:22:34] Frozenfruit13: I play support and I agree, support item is mega broken but i can enjoy it while it lasts kaypHappea
[1:22:35] alexfkinglu: hello there
[1:22:37] Hollow_CS: @arcadedani bro, you did spell bruisers wrong :D
[1:22:37] DoctaBones: ill take it
[1:22:40] homantic: so both teams leave mid empty??
[1:22:40] kristykat_: thatll be good
[1:22:48] alexandra_h_p: I think in the first official game of T1 vs Gen.G couple days ago, T1's botlane went double support item too... in an official match
[1:22:50] ObsceneSanity: no, you‚Äôre getting the cs penalty for farming with the item.
[1:22:52] arcadedani: they are going to nerfed
[1:23:00] jakabolta: the real supports like soraka lulu  yuumi sona etc feels lost but brand lux sera veigar vel feels like they are support but in fact they are mages mid whic is sad but hopfuly riot will fix it kaypLOL
[1:23:01] plaugecat: they dont sac the lane
[1:23:06] CrazySzopen: hauuu
[1:23:16] plaugecat: they get the same gold but a free item on adc slot bc of the giving stacks
[1:23:25] Azmod3ous: @KayPea not only should they make it one per team but they should bind it to the support role so ppl wont be able to troll by buying it
[1:23:25] Gossamer_DT: one support item per team will open a new troll angle
[1:23:27] PontiffYves: @jakabolta Did you really include Yuumi in that kaypSnipe
[1:23:50] kreumbly: I honestly feel like the only BROKEN supp item is the mage one. the rest are going it for a two item spike, not cause its really broken.
[1:23:51] jakabolta: @pontiffyves yes she has negative wrü§î
[1:23:55] Hollow_CS: putting a lot of damage on supp items is as fucked up as ultra high ap ratios on tank abilities :D
[1:24:01] luinardo: i don't think support item gold penalty does anything either lol
[1:24:03] S17Master: @Gossamer_DT Yea, that just sounds like whoever is not support that has the fastest fingers can grief the support
[1:24:09] Danydouu: i'm seeing so much acmille support whats up with that too
[1:24:12] Danydouu: camille
[1:24:14] kreumbly: They generally sell the other supp items when they are able to get another item
[1:24:21] jakabolta: i miss the times where yuumi was the most broken support not lux
[1:24:29] crueliith: i love the new season honestly
[1:24:37] PontiffYves: @Danydouu Camille is thriving this season.  I think people noticed that.. damn they'll nerf her as well
[1:24:54] Gossamer_DT: Yuumi is a fucking asshole cancer champ and should be removed from the game and the earth
[1:24:58] CrazySzopen: miau
[1:25:00] kreumbly: The prob with limiting to one per team or to "supp" role is that people can rage troll if its one per team.
[1:25:02] BayFlame: <3 <3 <3
[1:25:11] ataraxia78: This Q is taking long or am I just imagining?
[1:25:12] kreumbly: Top laner or mid can buy it before supp and now supp doesnt get it
[1:25:12] dylanship: yeah lux support can compare with other support but way better than lux mid :9
[1:25:17] Azmod3ous: @Gossamer_DT Tell us how you really feel XD
[1:25:19] Waterhead30: @kaypea some items are indeed unbalanced but i dont care cause im enjoying tanks atm with new items LUL
[1:25:19] dylanship: cant
[1:25:28] alexandra_h_p: I haven't been playing league for a long time but it sounds like every season has different huge issues lmao
[1:25:29] alex_zunflex: @Danydouu shes getting buffed next Patch LUL
[1:25:32] PontiffYves: That game just lit us on fire lmao, even though you ended up winning it
[1:25:39] Danydouu: @PontiffYves legit i get OSd even when i win lane agaist her
[1:25:41] kreumbly: But doing it for support role, they would need to allow role swapping against instead of just pick order
[1:25:42] TyrTheTiny: this rant has lasted too long, all i gather is that we have to eliminate supports, KILL THEM ALL
[1:25:47] luinardo: the thing is, wasn't that an issue when they limited smite to junglers only, stopping people from trading roles?
[1:25:55] Gossamer_DT: I feel that if I had a time machine and I could only use it once I would use it to go back and remove the person that pushed Yuumi into existance
[1:25:57] Danydouu: @alex_zunflex WHAT??? they also buffing ezreal whats going on ???
[1:26:04] let_james_play: i think limiting items to a role, can open up  a can of worms RIOT wont want to deal with, because where does it stop
[1:26:11] alex_zunflex: @alex_zunflex yea.. and these Ezreal buffs are HUGE!
[1:26:14] kreumbly: No
[1:26:22] alexandra_h_p: yes that was the worst dicision, like how did these changes make it out of PBE?
[1:26:26] theenation97: did they ever mention why they stopped doing pre-season?
[1:26:46] KOPrince93: Still like didiot better
[1:26:50] PontiffYves: Is the new dragon a midlaner?
[1:26:50] TyrTheTiny: they just said "woopsi"
[1:26:56] luinardo: yeah so now if you're supp and they limit supp item to supp, supp cant swap lanes
[1:27:02] Hollow_CS: @theenation97 so you can have fucked up meta while losing lp ! :D
[1:27:02] kreumbly: You technically only change pick order. So if they want to limit it to support, they would need to add role swapping again with pick order so that if someone swaps they can buy iy
[1:27:03] tinycaptain304: @theenation97 they said it "didn't matter" bc people wait until ranked to try new stuff anyway
[1:27:10] Azmod3ous: @theenation97 Good question bc the changes were on the PBE for quite awhile lol
[1:27:24] kreumbly: Smolder is a caster-adc
[1:27:28] kreumbly: Kinda like corki
[1:27:31] Danydouu: they literally start the season witout you being prepared its so funny
[1:27:32] Tritros: they said adc but riot has messed up before with roles
[1:27:32] Azmod3ous: @|Kaypea smolder is an adc
[1:27:35] alexandra_h_p: I saw a tweet from a riot dev basically saying that they're super pleased with this season ship because "no champion dropped or rose more than 4% on WR"
[1:27:41] PontiffYves: that little thing is an adc? kaypShame kaypShame
[1:27:47] ObsceneSanity: the devs explained that the lapse with preseason that a majority of the player base still first time everything in rank and it‚Äôs not worth the delay
[1:28:01] kreumbly: Yeah, smolder is just an updated and cuter Corki lol
[1:28:03] S17Master: @alexandra_h_p What. That's the only metric?
[1:28:05] luinardo: @kreumbly honestly so messy
[1:28:06] PontiffYves: @cepricobani kaypTeach I'm 20 thanks for asking

[1:28:50] ObsceneSanity: it was riot august who said that
[1:28:54] alexandra_h_p: @fluffy2103 even ezreal of all champs dropped 7% so idk what they base the stats on
[1:28:55] Azmod3ous: @KayPea Smolder has a hidden voice line with a 1% chance to say "My mom works for Riot and she's gonna ban you" lol
[1:28:58] Calleson: Haiiiii, how was your birthday?

[1:40:58] TyrTheTiny: the fact that he has a lot of abilities, low CDs, low mana cost, long range, high damage. is so annoying

[1:47:26] FuryOfTheCursed: I feel like since senna gets such long range autos her autos shouldnt slow anymore
[1:48:02] bigtibbyleia: isn‚Äôt it just her q that slows
[1:48:10] S17Master: @FuryOfTheCursed But then she wouldn't be a post 2018 champion

[1:49:28] ObsceneSanity: Lethality panth has been fun this season for me. I one shot everybody
[1:49:38] S17Master: @bigtibbyleia Q slows, but autos increase her movespeed. Which is kinda similar
[1:50:15] 2wack1: @ObsceneSanity that's due to the new hydra variant as well - so much dmg on active with enemies below 50%
[1:50:33] Azmod3ous: @elsamelba She's 2 and atm with this being #3
[1:50:38] ObsceneSanity: @2wack1 the fact that it applies to more than one person is crazy to me
[1:50:50] Gossamer_DT: I love it when the other jungler is off role because than I can say things like our jungler is getting out classed by an auto filled :D
[1:50:54] Azmod3ous: @elsamelba That meant to read 2 and 0 lol
[1:51:00] arcadedani: and now they die xD
[1:51:34] elsamelba: @azmod3ous thanks a lot! kaypGift
[1:51:45] CraigDott: I genuinely will never understand how tanks can do so much damage and take so little, surely it needs to be one of the other

[1:52:39] bigtibbyleia: do we have any AP shield breaking items anymore? or are they just bye bye
[1:52:58] dylanship: holy tanky
[1:53:10] TyrTheTiny: @bigtibbyleia there was an ap item to break shields?

[1:53:56] wolterbrm2021: hoooooo
[1:54:07] Azmod3ous: @bigtibbyleia although technically it wasn't a shield break just did more dmg and had more pen based on shield strength.
