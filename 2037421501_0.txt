[0:18:08] pingkytwitch: because it creates OTPs in solo queue whereas they literally cannot exist in pro play

[1:06:02] TheKittenJedi: grubby is just a few steps away from worlds yo
[1:06:10] BackdoorHerNexus: zoe r?
[1:06:14] TheKittenJedi: @everyman322 she has a warp, not quite same as a dash
[1:06:16] EluminatorTV: doesnt the ult proc sudden impact?
[1:06:17] MercuriaI_: "but r" bruh not even close to worth taking the rune
[1:06:26] everyman322: @TheKittenJedi it is a dash
[1:06:30] dntlss_mckj: he does not know any of the runes @Pobelter
[1:06:31] juri726: @TheKittenJedi like ordering a ticket to be in the audience? LUL
[1:06:48] TheKittenJedi: i thought dash specifically means your character slides across the screen
[1:06:53] TheKittenJedi: like Zeri e
[1:07:04] TheKittenJedi: while ezrael and zoe has warps
[1:07:14] amodace: yes but sudden impact stll works on them
[1:07:22] TorqueBandit: does zoe ult count as dash?
[1:07:22] TheKittenJedi: o
[1:07:23] amodace: not that its good tho
[1:07:27] Ophirr: @Pobelter does grubby know about w's three rays?
[1:07:32] TorqueBandit: also, I think it includes teleport like abilities, binks

[1:07:39] Finchit: NOTED

[1:08:20] everyman322: @TheKittenJedi I mean it's technically a blink but the rune works on either
[1:08:25] TheKittenJedi: he has 0 mana so you can do whateve ryou want to him lol
[1:08:30] yoPredicts: @TorqueBandit its a blink so should proc sudden impact

[1:17:28] stefan150: didnt they remove the auto attack reset part?
[1:17:32] Amaresu_: its so fucking impossible picking up league these days with so much to learn i swear
[1:17:42] Jotyma: Honestly, I recommend Lux or Annie for new players, but eh
[1:17:54] Dethrey: correct
[1:17:57] TheKittenJedi: later on Grubby will start seeing towers as potential E targets and then he'll be World's Ready
[1:18:00] Amaresu_: imagine not learning league playing zed leblanc and riven back in season 3 cause of faker
[1:18:13] TheKittenJedi: @Amaresu_ ....i dont have to imagine.
[1:18:13] KarmaEnjoyer: grubby has enough game experience to learn on any champ
[1:18:23] KarmaEnjoyer: bro was a pro gamer before most of you were born lol
[1:18:24] Amaresu_: @TheKittenJedi GIGACHAD despite your sus name ig
[1:18:28] Praetor_GG: he's afraid to limit test
[1:18:29] TheKittenJedi: grubby will find this game incredibly simple after he picks up the game sense
[1:18:37] TheKittenJedi: he played warcraft 3 for years where you control MULTIPLE heros and armies
[1:18:38] Ophirr: Could be helpful to show off some simple zoe combos in training tool
[1:18:39] Maxadelphia: yeah this game is extremely unfriendly for beginners. it always has been really, but now that we're 15 years in it's so much harder
[1:18:40] a_baby_worm: @Amaresu_ yeah u have to learn 150 champions and then 300+ matchups and a ton of items screammm
[1:18:45] TheKittenJedi: a game where you control 1 single hero will seem like cake to him
[1:18:46] stefan150: why doesnt he start out with lux or smth
[1:18:53] thomas27: actually interesting to see this
[1:18:54] Addyia: I think grubby really values knowledge being a wc3 and dota player where lots of strategy and tactics are involved
[1:18:58] BlueNightRose: @a_baby_worm erm 150 matchups btw
[1:19:02] TheKittenJedi: you guys underestimate grubby's game experience
[1:19:09] Amaresu_: @a_baby_worm the interactions between champs are one thing but like the concept of aa reset and that that specific item (that just got reintroduced a month ago xd) is one of them.. like...
[1:19:14] TheKittenJedi: he played warcraft 3 for a decade and in that game you control 3+ heros at a time
[1:19:21] Amaresu_: ik
[1:19:22] Dethrey: Q does more damage based on the distance it travels, hopefuly if Grubby  likes artillery mages he will like the champ but Xerath and Lux or zigs might be easier for him
[1:19:25] TheKittenJedi: and he was really really hgood at wc3
[1:19:28] a_baby_worm: @BlueNightRose math
[1:19:29] Amaresu_: i m just talking about the knowledge
[1:19:35] Amaresu_: league is easy mechanically
[1:19:39] インヂジォンズ: wow pob so early
[1:19:46] Amaresu_: comparatively to rts or fighting games anyway
[1:19:51] TheKittenJedi: yeah league is easy mechanically, its the knowledge and game sense thats hard to pick up
[1:19:54] Amaresu_: and for the most part. ofc there's harder champs than others but yeah.
[1:19:55] a_baby_worm: @Amaresu_ yeahhhhh its not my forte but its OK i just play for fun (and hope my friends who are good carry me)
[1:20:03] ovdovovac: probably harder with the bush distance in this season 4Head
[1:20:05] TheKittenJedi: easy to be good at, hard to be great at
[1:20:09] Praetor_GG: @Amaresu_ that only true if your only metric is APM
[1:20:10] Amaresu_: @a_baby_worm good for you. if you re not going pro or streaming this game thats all it should be.
[1:20:34] TheKittenJedi: i would at least try a sleep
[1:20:41] Zuren_Arrh: @thekittenjedi idk if « really good » is enough kek
[1:21:00] TheKittenJedi: i was understating by saying 'really good'. grubby won multiple tourneys
[1:21:18] TheKittenJedi: if you're good enough to win warcraft 3 tournaments you're definitely good enough to play league lol
[1:21:39] SinLagoon: these people just dont know how good grubby was
[1:21:42] cager1233: yeah zoe is such a hard champ
[1:21:56] SimonShouldSayStuff: This guys is smart as hell.
[1:21:56] TheKittenJedi: he started off with zoe and did this well, all the other champs will seem simple a f to him lol
[1:21:57] TorqueBandit: Grubby does a lot of metaphors and analogies
[1:22:02] Frothar: LUL
[1:22:07] KaiMarek: thas a sign of intelligence
[1:22:10] dixlowe: yes those help a lot of people learn
[1:22:55] TheKittenJedi: any amateur can land a skillshot. it takes a pro to think about logistics 10 minutes into the future.
[1:23:01] meowjification: time to explain freezing LUL
[1:23:04] Praetor_GG: all this shit is the easiest part of League anyway, the true test is how you handle LOSERQ Aware
[1:23:04] jordanmon18: @TheKittenJedi I kinda hope he 1 tricks zoe
[1:23:14] TheKittenJedi: me too. get zoe nerfed Kappa
[1:23:21] TheKittenJedi: fuck that champion lol
[1:23:32] TheKittenJedi: fuckin sleeped from two screens away then one shots you
[1:23:47] Gabzz659: just jg gap
[1:23:53] cager1233: yeah a really good zoe is one of the scariest things in leage
[1:23:53] Addyia: just tell him to continue spamming assist ping
[1:23:57] YouAreCuteXD: i think zoe is a high skill champion that's really entertaining to watch
[1:24:00] TheKittenJedi: rammus actually tried hard to gank gruby this game
[1:24:07] TheKittenJedi: oooooh that was close
[1:24:16] TheKittenJedi: he was inside the ori ult lmao and flashed out at the last frame
[1:24:25] SinLagoon: that flash was clean
[1:24:32] TheKittenJedi: perfectly timed flash
[1:24:51] Praetor_GG: classic

[1:26:11] Amaresu_: what is bluid waffling about
[1:26:13] Xey2510: TrollDespair
[1:26:15] TheKittenJedi: sweeping your enemy where you want them to go, like a broom sweeping dust
[1:26:21] meowjification: @TShep94 because ori is low hp and mana, he has flash and the jungler is a rammus
[1:26:27] TheKittenJedi: holy crap that Q damage is just nuts
[1:26:34] jordanmon18: wait till grubby gets jg support and mid in his lane
[1:26:35] Dreepi: I wish there was a thing where pobelter hopped on the champ in certain situations and showed exactly how its played

[2:46:40] OddVenturer: naw its better when ur mechanics are better
[2:46:42] draiinprince: but click ground better bc it lets you kite
[2:46:42] cager1233: yeah its a viktor mech, if your spamming auto after q it comes out faster @Pobelter
[2:46:54] OddVenturer: its cause he's standing still instead of moving, in lane ur never sitting there
[2:47:12] qaqwera2: WTF
[2:47:14] Nightbot: https://discord.com/invite/SsnXFXxkVt hang with the hottest dudes and eat at the chillest restaurants in my stream community Discord

[2:48:22] PopmycherryYO: just look at dps meters
[2:48:48] ExttincTT_: yea but here's my counteragrument: spaghetti
[2:48:54] Xey2510: on kalista it's rly insane
[2:49:09] nintendoman_: y is auto canceling so commonly used in dota laning but not league
[2:49:11] ovdovovac: staff angle minmax 5Head
[2:49:18] OddVenturer: i mean when enemy player is weaving in and out of viktor Q max range you need the auto cancel
[2:49:22] tka_killerangel: talk itemization maybe?
[2:49:28] b0ltz12: @nintendoman_ because you can deny your own creeps in dota
[2:49:34] shodan96: Some good Es are coming PepeLaugh

[2:49:58] Arctys: @nintendoman_ auto attack start up animations are much longer than in league
[2:50:01] curlythepube: league is a big game at this point tbh. there is a lot to learn especially if u want to high elo
[2:50:07] Ophirr: Tl:Dr if you input the attac command right after the spell channel bar disappears you'll attack much faster
[2:50:10] Kev141: the hell is he talking about these big words i do not understand
[2:50:16] Arctys: RIOT
[2:50:17] cager1233: hes learning

[2:50:44] b0ltz12: @nintendoman_ specifically, you are competing for every cs and deny with the opponent laner.
[2:50:49] Morrygu: riot coding what can you do
[2:51:10] juri726: riot coding is like taxes. doesnt make sense half the time, you just gotta adjust to it
[2:51:15] Arctys: classic

[8:40:42] worldwar5: good game
[8:40:45] nohootzbaby: song is so good actually
[8:40:51] Dread__Naught: The word “tilt” itself first originated among pinball players. The frustration from seeing the ball follow a path towards the gap between the flippers led some players to physically tilt the machine in an attempt to guide the ball to safety. Manufacturers quickly figured this out and added tilt-sensing devices to their machines. Moving or tipping the unit too much would then cause the machine to flash the word “TILT” and freeze the flippers, resulting in the ball being lost for certain.
[8:40:55] fralves: No other competitve option?

[8:41:59] OddVenturer: tilt: late Middle English (in the sense ‘fall or cause to fall, topple’): perhaps related to Old English tealt ‘unsteady’, or perhaps of Scandinavian origin and related to Norwegian tylten ‘unsteady’ and Swedish tulta ‘totter’.
