[1:35:34] LapisLazulies: @IKeepItTaco what are jhins worst adc matchups?
[1:35:43] JackSkalliov: For those who don't know, Humzh is the nose guy
[1:35:56] Syluxrox: Samira would be great in this meta if she didnt get one-shot instantly
[1:35:57] RamboGarnes: why not stormrazor?
[1:36:16] Kalendhis: @LapisAoki imo samira and kalista are nightmare
[1:36:25] Jaykeblakk: I ask because I'm a Samira player, and I feel like it's a very volatile matchup.
[1:36:25] kehdoodl: @Khronos_______ i think v1gorous1 is a samira main, but i discovered him yesterday so idk how much he plays her
[1:36:39] JackSkalliov: @Jaykeblakk Shame on you for playing Samira

[4:31:58] Saka8856: @kai_922 Yea because lethality in general is useless against tanks, but with the current meta being one shot heavy it's kinda the only viable build
[4:32:18] kai_922: Yea
[4:32:29] goofyjeffrickles: @Saka8856 only viable build when no mythics in the game, that's wild

[7:21:43] fevgatos_live: saving to save her azz
[7:21:52] fevgatos_live: just like seraphin from last game
[7:21:53] nausikha_lotus: @jillcaps17 do they main supp or were auto filled
[7:21:57] snafkin33: ashe supp is troll gimmick pick, you want a real supp in your team not that
[7:22:07] Distinct_Haze: yunny is good chat just an unfortunate game

[7:24:07] twitchderp1: didnt even realize hes meta thought he was just ok
[7:24:33] Ninawai: am i crazy or does he say -dge at the end of many words
[7:24:47] demonminer3: good riddance Listening
[7:24:49] better_call_sion: off meta related - would you consider manamune on lethality jhin? I just love the item
[7:25:12] Sanguchotos: banger song, banger game
[7:27:05] Lparizzi: Is Tryndamere meta now?
[7:27:08] jillcaps17: is d1 considered elo hell @IKeepItTaco ?
[7:27:19] crecentbear: im one game away from platinum 1 and being top 250 lillia player NA

[7:29:23] crecentbear: @jillcaps17 rank 266 rn
[7:29:25] better_call_sion: frfr on god deadass BillyApprove
[7:29:34] better_call_sion: bloody oath
[7:29:35] Moobly_: considering shes a lane bully, her mana costs are justified
[7:30:03] demonminer3: @Moobly_ of course, i understand that. still, super high
[7:30:05] Ninawai: well that was something
[7:30:06] fevgatos_live: mf so mana hungry
[7:30:51] Sanguchotos: 5 minutes in and they already fighting
[7:30:53] demonminer3: she also has super law base AD
[7:31:07] demonminer3: low*
[7:31:12] fevgatos_live: but she has dat bounce
[7:31:19] demonminer3: early damage is basically entirely on her passive
[7:31:29] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[7:31:30] JeffMadMastermind: @demonminer3 her passive compensate for that
[7:32:11] demonminer3: jungle tilted, gonna be a rough game
[7:32:19] jillcaps17: @demonminer3 tru
[7:32:39] fevgatos_live: i heard doublelift the other day and said MF is bad ... not top tier like jhin, varus, lucian
[7:32:41] Macklez_: did taco win alst game??
[7:32:50] jillcaps17: no
[7:32:53] JeffMadMastermind: @Macklez_ no :(
[7:32:56] Macklez_: no....
[7:32:58] Macklez_: Sadge
[7:33:01] emmanueljfn06: is miss strong?
[7:33:03] demonminer3: @fevgatos_live thats... gotta be somewhat a joke. like, she just has so much damage
[7:33:13] NapNapoleon: Hey, grubs have been done. I think you lose this one.
[7:33:28] fevgatos_live: @demonminer3 he said she is good in low elo but challenger level not really good
[7:33:32] demonminer3: even if she isnt meta, her lethality builds can shred full build ultiung mundo. I WOULD KNOW. I WAS THAT FULL BUILD ULTING MUNDO
[7:33:36] Macklez_: pyke???
[7:33:40] severussmercy: pyke?
[7:33:43] Toper27: toper2Stuart
[7:33:45] jillcaps17: report pyke
[7:33:48] Ninawai: smartest pyke
[7:33:56] JeffMadMastermind: ye, udyr is giga tilted already
[7:34:05] jillcaps17: this game is over sorry to say
[7:34:15] severussmercy: pyke report
[7:34:17] demonminer3: "nice ghost" so sayeth the pyke
[7:34:25] demonminer3: who practically inted
[7:34:27] nausikha_lotus: pyke being pyke, elo inflated champ unfortunate
[7:34:31] fevgatos_live: pyke supports: either they go 10/0 or 0/10 .. theres no in between
[7:34:59] JeffMadMastermind: oh no
[7:35:15] Deathhles: @IKeepItTaco how do you feel about voltaic cyclosword on jhin?
[7:35:53] joaopob3: mf is considered easy but it actually one of the hardest and most rewarding adc to learn because one good mf is rare and it pays
[7:36:11] nausikha_lotus: hardest is crazy
[7:36:32] LoLGeranimo: how the games goin tonighjtj
[7:36:36] fevgatos_live: @joaopob3 mf can be 0/5 but still can turn a game with a good E + R
[7:36:53] joaopob3: hardest I mean you need to really play 100% for it to be really good
[7:36:54] Macklez_: @LoLGeranimo dont ask monkaW
[7:37:04] jillcaps17: @LoLGeranimo cancer
[7:37:12] LoLGeranimo: @Macklez_ o god monkaW
[7:37:23] itsanthony1115: !opgg
[7:37:23] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[7:37:27] itsanthony1115: monkaW
[7:37:33] joaopob3: @fevgatos_live true. But i think its best for an mf to bully the lane and land good utility to her team
[7:37:44] jillcaps17: get me out
[7:37:51] demonminer3: no way that was worth for bard
[7:37:55] Ninawai: 2 flashes fpr pme
[7:37:59] Ninawai: for one*
[7:38:08] demonminer3: for a 0/4 mf, i might add.
[7:38:12] jillcaps17: WHAT IS THIS PYKE DOING
[7:38:14] nausikha_lotus: what are these cursed games
[7:38:17] demonminer3: not flaming taco, just like... insane
[7:38:19] hakushin: dia supps seem great
[7:38:29] demonminer3: and hes doing great!
[7:38:57] better_call_sion: might be 0/4 but his cs is not low and he shared gold with pyke
[7:39:01] fevgatos_live: like tarzaned says: losers que once again
[7:39:09] joaopob3: if you get to master mf you will feel like its one of the best to hard carry
[7:39:10] better_call_sion: okay nevermind
[7:39:13] NapNapoleon: Your life is suffering.
[7:39:25] severussmercy: looks botlane diff. but pyke is horrible, report him.
[7:39:38] jillcaps17: yes please report his ass
[7:39:52] NapNapoleon: I mean, there's no point to report someone just because they're bad. Unless it's intentional.
[7:40:21] fevgatos_live: if pyke is not ruling early game then he gonna just exist like a minion running around the map
[7:40:22] jillcaps17: there is a point. hopefully they get banned and they dont end up supporting u again
[7:40:23] Ninawai: @NapNapoleon i agree but bro was being toxic and agressive when it was their fault
[7:40:42] snafkin33: permaban every ashe supp player
[7:40:57] NapNapoleon: I guess that's fair then
[7:40:59] jillcaps17: these kids need to learn their lesson
[7:41:03] cornboteats: love the music
[7:41:07] bubbyston: @snafkin33 AMEN
[7:41:21] NapNapoleon: Permaban every jungler player
[7:41:33] Roostmaster: >get back in stream >pinned message from Zianni zianniPog
[7:41:35] better_call_sion: okay who else
[7:41:36] NapNapoleon: Also do it for mid and top
[7:41:38] jillcaps17: udyr lowkey reportable too
[7:41:59] nausikha_lotus: @jillcaps17 why is he being toxic to zoe
[7:42:00] Ninawai: the sounds on this skin are just SO GOOD
[7:42:02] fevgatos_live: buy tear
[7:42:13] Roostmaster: 0-5, fucking oof
[7:42:25] Roostmaster: Was Jhin banned?
[7:42:27] pancake7766: tear super useless
[7:42:27] demonminer3: you are the fast
[7:42:37] pancake7766: would only slow him more
[7:42:43] pancake7766: also mf don’t need tear
[7:42:47] jillcaps17: @nausikha_lotus bc he tried ganking mid early wen zoes ult wasnt even up and then complained when it didnt work
[7:42:59] jillcaps17: @Roostmaster yes
[7:43:03] nausikha_lotus: @jillcaps17 insane behavior, mental diff as usual
[7:43:04] Roostmaster: whuff
[7:43:04] NapNapoleon: I knew it.
[7:43:34] jillcaps17: this zoe is competent. may be the win condition. THIS GAME IS WINNABLE
[7:43:35] Roostmaster: PYKE LETS GOOOOO
[7:43:35] Macklez_: OKAY
[7:43:40] fevgatos_live: @pancake7766 tobias fate always buy tear on mf, no mana no abililiies to spam
[7:43:44] NapNapoleon: Pyke pressed a button.
[7:43:44] Roostmaster: YEEEEEEEEEEEEAH BABY
[7:43:46] Roostmaster: Also
[7:44:01] jillcaps17: calculated @IKeepItTaco
[7:44:02] Roostmaster: Tear on MF is amazing
[7:44:06] Roostmaster: Legit
[7:44:07] better_call_sion: Butterfly effect
[7:44:10] Ninawai: always two steps ahead
[7:44:14] Roostmaster: Dunno why people are dissing it
[7:44:20] Roostmaster: But buying it late IS stupid
[7:44:31] Roostmaster: "Yes i would like an unfinished item please"
[7:44:35] jillcaps17: u wanna buy it early same logic as cull
[7:44:47] Roostmaster: I start Cull into IMMEDIATE tear
[7:44:50] pancake7766: because you need to rush collector on her tear is just useless
[7:44:59] Roostmaster: NO oyou dont lmao what
[7:45:10] Roostmaster: F
[7:45:10] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Did they rework manamune or smth? Why are people talking about Tear MF?
[7:45:17] joaopob3: mf is jhin level of perfect design on league
[7:45:22] better_call_sion: I dont play mf but shouldn't POM and careful mana management solve mf mana issues
[7:45:25] Foserious: lmao team abandoned him
[7:45:32] Roostmaster: I don't blame them
[7:45:33] demonminer3: @better_call_sion yes
[7:45:40] pancake7766: well if you buy tear on mf you probably in iron
[7:45:48] Roostmaster: would you try and save an 0-6 MF?
[7:45:49] Ninawai: wholesome tanks
[7:45:56] demonminer3: @demonminer3 manamune is pretty good on her, but she does super well with general snowballing
[7:46:01] pancake7766: collector extended your ult damage it is massive
[7:46:09] joaopob3: tear mf is good when you going to rely on your habilities and do an lethality build with less hits
[7:46:23] Roostmaster: So does Essence Reaver and Navori
[7:46:24] joaopob3: is good against squshies
[7:46:29] nausikha_lotus: uh
[7:46:31] NapNapoleon: That's...
[7:46:39] nausikha_lotus: pyke brain :3
[7:46:41] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[7:46:42] jillcaps17: bard got shut down on this idiot pyke
[7:46:45] bubbyston: interesting?
[7:46:50] FairyArtist: at least the bounty goes to bard?
[7:46:51] Ninawai: that's good because he gave the big shutdown to bard and not someone else who could carry
[7:46:52] bubbyston: as a pyke main, I approve
[7:46:52] TheLightsider: bounty wasted on bard :^)
[7:46:53] demonminer3: better than navori on crit MF
[7:46:54] Roostmaster: INTeresting lulw
[7:46:57] nausikha_lotus: @bubbyston LOL
[7:47:02] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: How does MF Q interact with the go sky item
[7:47:13] joaopob3: if the enemy has lots of life you can even do an liandrys mf with rylai rabbadon and ludens
[7:47:14] bubbyston: @nausikha_lotus :3
[7:47:27] Roostmaster: My main build on MF is Cull/Tear ER, Manamune, Navori
[7:47:35] crecentbear: chat i have an announcement.
[7:47:39] Roostmaster: oh no
[7:47:53] NapNapoleon: Shadow the hedgehog is a...

[7:48:29] crecentbear: but its my name as is twitch
[7:48:32] hakushin: nice bro
[7:48:39] crecentbear: Crecent Bear
[7:48:46] jillcaps17: congratulations
[7:48:48] joaopob3: see mf is complex
[7:48:58] fevgatos_live: @Roostmaster and then axiom for double ults
[7:49:02] jillcaps17: GALIO NO R
[7:49:09] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Does IE now stack with the crit ability item?
[7:49:09] better_call_sion: Items dont define your playstyle, they enable it . I have seen mains of a champion building completely different items because of their unique playstyles
[7:49:10] Ninawai: CANNON
[7:49:10] Nightbot: 2794 Cannons Missed LuL @IKeepItTaco
[7:49:21] kism7: ikeepitLUCY
[7:49:25] Roostmaster: I go super cast heavy because my elo is all tanks all the time, with a LDR or Black Cleaver depending if i'm actually getting hit
[7:49:40] jillcaps17: can someone just hit mid tower once

[7:50:44] jillcaps17: y is something like that even banworthy like whats the logic behind it
[7:50:55] Roostmaster: You can hide links
[7:51:01] Roostmaster: Hyperlinks, typo links
[7:51:02] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: This literally my old build. I thought Lethality was OP this patch
[7:51:06] Roostmaster: Really easy phishing

[7:51:22] crecentbear: rank 230 lillia na now :D
[7:51:26] pancake7766: it is playing other than lethality is just stupid
[7:51:40] Roostmaster: I was 496 Syndra in NA yesterday lol
[7:51:47] pancake7766: but some people always know better than pro players who play only lethality
[7:51:53] nausikha_lotus: @Roostmaster huge
[7:51:56] Roostmaster: I hit top 500 Sonas worldwide a couple patches ago
[7:52:06] Roostmaster: my silver ego was massive
[7:52:13] jillcaps17: wait thats actually insane if u are actually the number one lilia in NA
[7:52:18] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Pros also blay bloodthirster mf last season though
[7:52:42] pancake7766: bloodthirster is good as 4/5 item
[7:52:55] Roostmaster: I also got banned from ranked for calling myself a naughty word which was top tier comedy on Riot's part
[7:53:02] jillcaps17: ru going to try and take it a step further now and try to become the best lilia in the world?
[7:53:02] Roostmaster: (only 5 matches)
[7:53:05] better_call_sion: yeah they want bt to be built later
[7:53:14] Roostmaster: BT wants to be built later
[7:53:37] Roostmaster: You can't really 'rush' BT anymore
[7:53:38] Macklez_: boop
[7:53:40] Ninawai: bro finally did it

[7:54:04] jillcaps17: !music
[7:54:09] emmanueljfn06: serylda is better
[7:54:09] Roostmaster: Yeah that was crazy good
[7:54:52] NearOneLove: that's so much damage.   Imagine that wasn't a galio.
[7:54:52] Roostmaster: I remember the BT Rush Draven days
[7:54:52] taha501: yo isnt sunderer sky broken on MF
[7:55:06] Roostmaster: SSky is weird
[7:55:29] taha501: in what way is it buggy on her
[7:55:45] exepher: oof
[7:55:45] Roostmaster: Idk why more people dont go for an early sheen on MF though
[7:55:49] Roostmaster: F
[7:55:55] chicken_dew: Are you feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeding?
[7:56:06] crecentbear: @jillcaps17 i wanna hit diamond first lmfao got a gaming pc last year so can be competitive fr now
[7:56:11] torrminator95: bad angles in last 3 ults
[7:56:11] joaozindejuliet: quem joga de mf tem que se lasca todo desculpa taco
[7:56:14] UnluckyBlade: @roostmaster mf has the lowest basead with senna
[7:56:17] jillcaps17: @crecentbear fair fair
[7:56:28] Roostmaster: I just sit forward in my gaming chair and climb bros
[7:56:30] jillcaps17: @chicken_dew pyke inted taco early mid
[7:56:30] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @Roostmaster sky titanic bug abusing?
[7:56:30] Roostmaster: its that easy
[7:56:39] jillcaps17: it was 2v1 lane
[7:56:42] Roostmaster: There's a bug with Sky and Titanic?
[7:56:48] crecentbear: @Roostmaster can't forget the tunes
[7:56:56] Roostmaster: No tunes
[7:57:00] Roostmaster: rawdog life
[7:57:04] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @Roostmaster heard it from chat. titanic reset crits twice
[7:57:05] taha501: @Roostmaster cz it cost 1000 now and triforce is expensive af u delay ur spike for not much payoff ig
[7:57:29] Roostmaster: The Sheen change i kinda get tho
[7:57:29] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: er though
[7:57:44] Roostmaster: ER mf is so good
[7:57:58] nausikha_lotus: very useful for pyke to have all these kills
[7:58:01] Moobly_: malignance applies multiple times on mf ult
[7:58:20] Roostmaster: Ah yeah because if you build AP on MF you're using your ulti
[7:58:23] Roostmaster: ofc
[7:58:23] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Can you go IE and the ability crit former mythic item now?
[7:58:27] Roostmaster: no
[7:58:37] Moobly_: ap mf ult actually shreds
[7:58:42] taha501: @Roostmaster its just that lithality is too good on adcs who can use it
[7:58:58] final_zangetsu: @WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo rageblade no navori yes
[7:58:59] taha501: its actually more efficient on adcs than assassins
[7:59:01] Roostmaster: Lethality desperately needs a revert
[7:59:06] Roostmaster: To what it was
[7:59:14] Roostmaster: scaling instead of flat
[7:59:15] Moobly_: lethality doesnt make sense
[7:59:16] Roostmaster: pelase
[7:59:21] Roostmaster: It's just
[7:59:25] Roostmaster: flat armor pen
[7:59:33] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: @final_zangetsu Rageblade doesn't convert crit anymore no? That doesn't make sense
[7:59:36] emmanueljfn06: why go crit? lol
[8:00:00] Roostmaster: Ult can crit, Q can crit
[8:00:06] WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo: Wait. Did I miss lethality being reworked to not scale with levels again?
[8:00:12] Roostmaster: ZANG
[8:00:16] Roostmaster: @WhatRUDoingStepRemodemo yeah
[8:00:21] Roostmaster: It's just flat 1 to 1 now
[8:00:29] Roostmaster: Meaning it's better
