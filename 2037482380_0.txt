[2:21:35] alierenA04: they are playing for LP
[2:21:36] OrangeDux: I think it's because people have no experience against actually good gwens so since they always see her losing they think she's weak
[2:21:41] evilkaese1: @yorickmain2 tbh d blade sucks now cuz no omnivamp anymore
[2:21:42] BigFatJellyBear: @yorickmain2 yeah true, just trying to get the knowledge which one  to start

[2:22:20] Yorickmain2: @evilkaese1 the ad is still good, and lifesteal helps to sustain from wave
[2:22:20] huoclaus: @OrangeDux gwen is a very simple champ, so a "weak gwen" means a bad player is piloting it

[3:18:15] qoqo123456789: singed is fart and run
[3:18:15] XyZlORD: i agree with you but how does he get this elo , he must be doing something diff than other singed mains , or is it RNG gameplay?
[3:18:16] nawaf105: take your team and stop him right ?
[3:18:19] Howlyy_: or this type of gameplay needs to be bannable
[3:18:22] shaxxogwx: in which season did u start playing aatrox?

[3:21:46] Komlin111: his q should spit out tiny warwicks that farm the lane for you @WunchleR
[3:22:29] Diorgens: @Komlin111 singed is just another mad scientist that uses potions, just make it his thing
[3:22:36] n00binati: which champ is your favorite to lane against
[3:22:39] thedreadfulgamer64: jakshot

[3:23:40] CaiusBloodRaven: maybe varus gets the memo now
[3:23:47] sodaasf: Is Sundered Sky good on Aatrox?
[3:23:47] tommmmmmassssss: even wins didnt feel rewarding since i wouldnt do anything

[3:24:02] aakashwani_: !rank
[3:24:09] TremboViego: @tommmmmmassssss pick Darius and invade lvl2 the jgl, make him regret the day he was born
[3:24:09] moppin_de_ting_yeh: y singed should never be viable

[3:25:01] chaser_sus: hashin vibes
[3:25:02] ToneDoLOL: holy MODS apm check
[3:25:14] tommmmmmassssss: his playstyle is unique to be fair but not in a good way
[3:25:33] drago_frago: @Naayil is the passive auto buff live?
[3:25:38] WunchleR: which is worse vayne or singed top?
[3:25:42] Diorgens: really enjoyable game, i can see it required a lot of mental energy
[3:25:45] Aggz0: true
[3:25:45] eisalt123: lmaooo
[3:25:45] Komlin111: its like kayn in the jungle, just ignores every ward
[3:25:47] tommmmmmassssss: @greeky420 shits useless bro would you rather have 6 grubs or one single ocean drake?
[3:25:48] adrianna_zmora: EW

[3:26:23] Diorgens: he doesnt even remove the pink ward lol
[3:26:26] Komlin111: did he cheat for real? maybe but he shouldnt have beat magnus without 100% concentration on the match
[3:26:28] XyZlORD: game is over anyway wdym he missed xp
[3:26:32] thegodofparmesan: it’s not strength is playstyle, any champ like illaoi and singed who’s counter play is to ignore them isn’t fun for game health
[3:26:47] tommmmmmassssss: @greeky420 ure tweaking if u think 6 grubs are better than one single drake
[3:26:55] moughitoos: @tommmmmmassssss  grubs all day!!!!!!! nothing beats true dmg to towers, drake is for micro grubs for macro and as you prolly know MACRO >>>>>>>>> micro
[3:26:57] tommmmmmassssss: id take any drake over 6 grubs
[3:27:03] ClimbingChicken: I think the way they win games can be translated to other toplane champions

[3:56:55] Komlin111: I remember playing her and going oom after 2 qs
[3:56:55] ttttolga: when did they buff her
[3:57:08] davskirok: Das why she farmin with Q
[3:57:15] Vlasuo: i will severe your limbs BatChesting
[3:57:32] soulcombustion: hexdrinker is bad I ran the math, just get a negatron and a ruby crystal
[3:57:57] ttttolga: her energy not run out at all almost like manaless champ
[3:57:59] Vlasuo: @soulcombustion then u lose ad?
[3:58:01] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[3:58:23] Yoshiiyuki: -1
[3:58:25] soulcombustion: @Vlasuo then you lose less gold toward first item cuz the ruby is in the recipe of sundered sky
[3:58:43] midtopbeast: what u play if attrox get banned
[3:58:51] ttttolga: make sense
[3:59:22] ttttolga: @midtopbeast dodge
[3:59:30] Vlasuo: @soulcombustion how did u test. cuz the more mr u buy the less effective, especially the higher level you are. also finishing maw of malmortius is better no?
[3:59:37] thedreadfulgamer64: i keep seeing akali top since s14 i guess new items made her even more boosted
[3:59:45] alierenA04: nayil eating, nayil chill
[3:59:45] midtopbeast: @ttttolga doesn’t even second pick just dodged
[3:59:49] PukieOP: you might be getting dove
[3:59:55] Vlasuo: ur jgl is a riven top main
[4:00:00] ttttolga: @midtopbeast yeap and go smurf
[4:00:37] LetMeFlingYou: remember kids
[4:00:40] midtopbeast: it feels harder to Smurf cus every season low elo gets shitter and shitter
[4:00:40] LetMeFlingYou: always protect yourself
[4:00:50] thedreadfulgamer64: now you have condom you ought to be safe
[4:00:59] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[4:01:08] soulcombustion: @Vlasuo I did the math for lvl 9 with hexdrinker and calculated effective health. The shield is 190 at 9 and goes up by 10 per level. negatron is just 900g deviation from your first item while hex is 1350. Even if theoritacly hex makes u tankier she will just out spike you on first item very hard
[4:01:20] ttttolga: she has tp?
[4:01:33] midtopbeast: @soulcombustion touch grass god dam
[4:01:43] soulcombustion: @midtopbeast kekw?
[4:01:47] thedreadfulgamer64: ok i didnt expect akali to do that
[4:01:47] Alskarr: helo dad
[4:01:48] ttttolga: where did she get all that hp from
[4:01:54] davskirok: @midtopbeast lol true i wanted to smurf but got stuck silver 1 forever and im a pla2/3 player
[4:01:56] Vlasuo: @soulcombustion yes but u outspike her BEFORE first item. and u wanna build MAW later as well cuz its op item. idk i would rather that personally
[4:02:16] RezaHIY: !elo

[4:02:38] soulcombustion: @Vlasuo I dont think anyone out spikes akali
[4:02:55] midtopbeast: @davskirok just play jungle and control the game easiest way to climb out of low elo
[4:03:05] davskirok: !rank
[4:03:08] fredike: 9
[4:03:08] JoshSabiniano: how you doin boss, still sick?

[4:04:00] davskirok: @midtopbeast oh no ive quited league for like 2 years now i just play weekends if im feeling lazy like 2 3 ish games
[4:04:02] ttttolga: he deal some dmg
[4:04:23] x7moodali538: how long it ganna take me to master aatrox
[4:04:47] Komlin111: I cant tell if roa is bad now cus its so much cheeper but worse stats and no ms
[4:04:57] midtopbeast: @davskirok fair enough just play arena it’s fun and u don’t get toxic team mates and it’s fun
[4:05:36] cheerios20203: are you in losers queue?
[4:05:43] ttttolga: worse
[4:05:48] cheerios20203: ı had that three times this year
[4:06:00] cheerios20203: entire team with negative winrate
[4:06:05] midtopbeast: @cheerios20203 not loser que just playing with losers
[4:06:12] ttttolga: she dont even use second ult
[4:06:28] Grogswow: have you ever thought about getting a foot massage?
[4:06:31] bazkera: your jg is top main i think

[4:08:01] Vlasuo: BatChesting
[4:08:03] ttttolga: i swear gragas voting no
[4:08:09] soulcombustion: @Vlasuo I just ran the math for lvl 9, negatron alone is already more effective health than hexdrinker, without even accounting for the ruby crystal you could get with the extra gold left
[4:08:20] alierenA04: dog gragas
