[1:03:31] mircenea: true
[1:03:41] NovusA1: Riot could charge a thousand dollars for a skin and I wouldn't care. Meh, let rich people support the company, I won't spend any money on them.

[1:05:47] DrinkDrink123: or they could invest the money they earn from the chroma into the game
[1:05:50] NovusA1: @Nightblue3 You're too optimistic. You need to take your hopes and dreams and let them die.
[1:05:56] tryashurami: that is such a dumb mentality everybody says "let the guys who wanna buy skins let them buy them you dont need to", but if they do this every fucking time the system is getting worse and worse and we letting them get away with shay shit more and more
[1:05:56] sebacu01: rengar
