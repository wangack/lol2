[0:51:48] boomerski: I'd like to see how a team of challengers does against pro teams
[0:51:53] Lionhardt544: I miss that too, to be honest
[0:51:56] Hyst28: YIPPEE is today a Palworld kinda day YIPPEE :3
[0:51:56] DarthAchilles: To much turn over on teams killed lcs
[0:52:01] BerryLogical: @quantPickle Hi dear mimiSalute
[0:52:03] ElleShaped: now they still exist... with a whole new roster ;)
[0:52:07] clueless810: @lucentex of course :)
[0:52:17] hokieboy01: catLurk 󠀀
[0:52:17] DarthAchilles: People change teams every year
[0:52:18] 88_dohko: Hello
[0:52:19] quantPickle: @BerryLogical BerryLogical husKissy yo
[0:52:19] ElleShaped: it's hard to follow a team when every 5 weeks it's 3 new people
[0:52:20] WaterbedG: Hello its me
[0:52:22] stupid_idiot56: meow
[0:52:23] BeRT2me: @stupid_idiot56 Good Kitten catErm
[0:52:26] majesticwizardcat: yooo
[0:52:27] CooIEv: now teams get an all new roster that has no correlation with the last roster
[0:52:28] DarthAchilles: How can you root for a team that isn't a team
[0:52:34] CooIEv: every year
[0:52:36] skinny_sumo_wrestler: Hello
[0:52:38] Hyst28: I mean, that pressure to perform, plus money they had available, meant that they were changing 3 or 4 players out of a roster every single split
[0:52:40] malikhulia13: the thing that killed LCS might have been ads :33
[0:52:45] quantPickle: we have a pooky Gasp
[0:52:53] prestonias: when sneaky retired I was done
[0:52:53] CooIEv: yo
[0:52:56] Lionhardt544: @DarthAchilles I kinda agree. Connection to a team felt arbitrary because they weren't tied to places like physical sports and players changed so much so you didn't get connected to players
[0:52:57] quantPickle: is that lauren Suscatgi
[0:52:57] clueless810: Everything is on live patch so the meta should be different in LCS now
[0:52:58] TheCoffeeCurator: okaytime to pick ashe again Smoge
[0:53:02] JerryFromSeinfeld: Dont you love lucian nami
[0:53:05] sweatycamgirl_: we hate lucian nami fishJAM
[0:53:14] Hyst28: I mean, LCS just never bothered to actually try and come up with new things, always kinda had that resigned attitude
[0:53:15] Ningbeck: pros kinda just play the same champs unless something is broken Shruge
[0:53:15] perdikinho: why is Diana so beautiful?!
[0:53:24] s4Golden: we need assassins in lcs
[0:53:31] NaeIum: Praygi for fearless draft in the future
[0:53:41] alinflorian81: There was a time when even velkoz was played
[0:53:48] ItsFilthyInHere: pros will play consistent champs with consistent strategies
[0:53:49] DarthAchilles: @Lionhardt544 Yeah, and they can't build team chemistry. Smoge
[0:53:50] quantPickle: Hey pooky_______ are you lauren Suscatgi
[0:54:26] Lionhardt544: @DarthAchilles Oh man yeah that too.  Like how do you know if you work well with someone if you never get enough time to figure out their communication style?
[0:54:26] Hyst28: I mean, at the same time as what you are saying was happening in NA, over in EU and sometimes even KR, it was an absolute psycho fest just picking random champions seemingly for fun
[0:54:28] waffillow: ipullup and type Hello
[0:54:28] lunalana696: why didn't riot just turn the LCS quality from "bad" to "good" suzakus

[0:55:02] Hyst28: Glacial augment azir with that silly potion rune and going full crit Kappa

[0:56:58] big_daddi_p: sneaky and qtpie were like the only reason i watched lcs
[0:56:59] Holleaux_: How do I bully Azir? I can bully him with Yorick, but with other champ I get Scared.
[0:57:04] cootyforfun: don’t u like new sneaky? cosplay sneaky?

[1:31:05] hi_im_soapy: *dont
[1:31:17] Ningbeck: Isn't palworld basically an offbrand pokemon game for pokemon fans (also exploitation woohoo )
[1:31:28] TheK10S: The river is too big now that you can walk on a side and not be seen by that ward
[1:31:32] clueless810: My humor is broken, I started giggling at the fact that that ward was destroyed and not 5 seconds later, a new one was placed there
[1:31:33] ultharian1: YES
[1:31:33] Cloaked13: @Ningbeck YES
[1:31:35] allaure: @allaure RAGEY overhyped 'unpolished' ea buggy stinky barren $30 fotm game
[1:31:45] gymleaderjusten: pokemon with guns and it's very EA
[1:31:52] nuttyytft: palworld= monster hunter +pokemans
[1:31:56] R_to_Moonfall: @Ningbeck Pokemon with guns
[1:31:58] allaure: @allaure hai death UsHugging Loves MyBeloved
[1:32:02] gymleaderjusten: Go play Monster Hunter it's way better
[1:32:04] sassboyyy: Does fizz not have mana issues anymore
[1:32:04] Gunnarson: wait, we not rockin with palworld in this chat? the game is hype
[1:32:07] Ningbeck: 30 bucks isn't terrible for a new flavor of the month game tho...
[1:32:08] allaure: i watched a few hours of it today and it felt like such a bore
[1:32:15] papamerfmerf: nick i got a pokemon with a gun
[1:32:16] CSignoreto: the way they catch the "pokemon"
[1:32:17] Ningbeck: like if it were 60 I'd be very eww
[1:32:22] allaure: @Ningbeck $30 pricetag on an early access game in itself is a problem
[1:32:25] hi_im_soapy: everyone says palworld is like pokemon but do they mean like the good pokemon games or dogshit ones recently? tink
[1:32:35] piggietheone: SOAPYYY rawr
[1:32:39] Ningbeck: perhaps, yes $30 bucks for a not finished product
[1:32:42] hi_im_soapy: piggie rawr
[1:32:42] gavasa: @piggietheone mewheniGETyou
[1:32:42] Ningbeck: not ideal
[1:32:44] ItsFilthyInHere: well palworld looks better than scarlet and violet that's for sure LOL
[1:32:46] lunalana696: @hi_im_soapy A bit of both I think keking
[1:32:47] piggietheone: gavasa mewheniGETyou
[1:32:52] Holleaux_: Does 7tv no exists on Firefox? hmjj
[1:32:52] Gunnarson: @hi_im_soapy its like pokemon simply in the way that there is pokemon in the game and you can catch them
[1:32:56] jayrsea: its expensive for early access
[1:32:58] ultharian1: is there any  good pokemon game tho
[1:33:05] clueless810: I mean I think the steam charts speaks for itself when it has 370k people playing on release
[1:33:12] SleepingZeus04: heard of ark? KEKW
[1:33:12] Nuirama: @hi_im_soapy I think its mostly for the looks of the thingies and the way you capture stuff, the core gameplay is completely different
[1:33:13] stevenrock: yo
[1:33:20] clueless810: Must be doing something right Shruge
[1:33:27] kyuz0: it has a good amount of content for 30 bucks tho
[1:33:27] NadiaBusiness: I predict the novelty of "Pokemon but Dark" will wear off quickly
[1:33:31] TheK10S: How do yo not have mana problems on fizz?
[1:33:37] ItsFilthyInHere: byeee fishlord
[1:33:38] DarthAchilles: Just cause a game has a lot of people playing on release doesn't make it good
[1:33:51] odinsmire: the look of the creatures doesnt match the rest of the game imo it's very jarring
[1:33:56] mercurialprime: you can play for free if you have gamepss
[1:33:59] allaure: its just personal opinion and bias i have no interest in it
[1:34:04] Holleaux_: Me casually paying $110 for Tarkov
[1:34:04] anti_negative_: yeah im down for GTA and pokemon to stay seperate lol
[1:34:05] ultharian1: starfield much
[1:34:06] GyabGyab: palworld is just ark but with cute "pokemon" like creatures
[1:34:07] lolcrestfallen: will you build storm surge?
[1:34:13] allaure: i just dont want $30 ea hypegames to be the norm
[1:34:23] nuttyytft: glueless
[1:34:23] TheK10S: How do you not have mana problems on fizz?
[1:34:24] DarthAchilles: How many people played New World on release ( I played 500 hours in the first month)
[1:34:27] clueless810: @darthachilles Oh I know, D4 xdd but it’s also not a AAA title which usually populates the big release but bad game genre
[1:34:27] Coyotedash: the game can be bad but entretaining enough to be played for a bit
[1:34:27] tbakm: doesnt mean its not good
[1:34:33] hi_im_soapy: yea the cute designs + guns and slavery thing is a huge clash its kinda cringe to me tbh
[1:34:41] anti_negative_: never  was i thinking while playing pokemon "this shit has way too little crime and exploitation, and guns" xdd
[1:34:45] popper729: "Just because a game has a lot of people playing it on release doesn't mean it's good"... Are we talking about New World?
[1:34:48] hi_im_soapy: reminds me of like awful asset flip horror games
[1:34:48] clueless810: I still play New World…
[1:34:55] orretr: @DarthAchilles HUH
[1:34:56] i_am_v_: Hello
[1:35:01] Ningbeck: people still pay new world WOAH
[1:35:02] allaure: @hi_im_soapy the graphics on it make it feel like a massively empty early 2000s mmo with the occasional group of cutesy pokemon here and there
[1:35:06] Ningbeck: play*
[1:35:21] GyabGyab: @DarthAchilles 500 hours are you ok?? HUH
[1:35:25] ItsFilthyInHere: too much yapping in this chat now lol
[1:35:25] allaure: i also dont understand how you can have a basebuilder game not have pvp on release
[1:35:52] Ningbeck: hours played doesn't mean like actual time invested in an MMO tho, sometimes its just a vibe and afk time
[1:35:56] TheK10S: How do you avoid mana problems on fizz?
[1:36:01] DarthAchilles: Any new game like an mmo I play usually 30 to 40 hours straight and then sleep for 5 and do it again.
[1:36:13] allaure: dougie,,,
[1:36:24] GyabGyab: @DarthAchilles i did that with lost ark Despairge
[1:36:25] allaure: i dont even think lost ark captivated me that much

[4:38:56] hi_im_soapy: @averygoodally intuitively, we would declare each separate twin their own person, so one twin committing some crime does not entail that the other twin is guilty of the same crime. there would probably be a question of whether the other twin is an accomplice tho (whether they kept silent about the crime, whether they did anything to try prevent it etc). as for punishment, it would seem to be far worse to punish someone who doesnt deserve punishment than not punish someone who does

[4:46:34] Hyst28: I love how the EUW pros who were playing inhouses for 2 weeks on 14.1 before anyone else had it, were convinced that stormsurge was even worse than cryptbloom, and then on live 14.1, storm even got a nerf and it was still the most op as shit thing xdd

[4:47:05] Ms_Teemo: mimiNodders
[4:47:06] averygoodally: @hi_im_soapy anyway i was referring more to what strategy an attorney would employ to convince a jury that the attached twin is in fact innocent of being an accomplice given the immediate response of "you're literally attached to them how could you possibly not be an accomplice". And the difficulties that having the innocent defendant and guilty killer on the stand at the same time poses towards making a strong legal defense
[4:47:17] bornstray: twitchcon deez
[4:47:18] hi_im_soapy: innocent
[4:47:22] averygoodally: xdd

[4:50:54] mummbly: i take meds for that peepoSitti
[4:50:55] hi_im_soapy: @averygoodally this would probably depend on the particulars of the case i tink , like if the innocent twin genuinely did try to prevent harm or whatever, i think it would be pretty clear to a jury that each twin is an individual (they each have their own isolated brain and so on)

After freeing itself from the spirit realm, Nocturne now continually descends upon the waking world, to feed on the kind of fear that can only thrive in true darkness.
