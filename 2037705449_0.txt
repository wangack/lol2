[0:53:38] DeadlyBoy1234: is nashor better for games that ends around 25 mins?
[0:55:57] SpringSong: this squishy but have zhonya+banshee idk
[0:56:27] xLeSeigneurBalekx: ye we could build defensive items
[0:56:45] xLeSeigneurBalekx: but now we are squishy AF and they nerf shroom CD on top of it
[0:56:47] xLeSeigneurBalekx: it's so unfair
[0:57:12] SpringSong: @xLeSeigneurBalekx yea thanks to silver player lose againts teemo KEKW
[0:58:06] SpringSong: even it'll be nerfed on E
[0:59:24] shanenaniganss: who is in charge of these teemo nerfs?
[0:59:38] SpringSong: but what we gona put instead of nashor or liandry
[0:59:56] BadassKetchup: 11 raiders from BadassKetchup have joined! 
[1:00:01] tobyteemo: hipav
[1:00:07] BadassKetchup: teemoing non-toxic taimo mains taimo stream
[1:00:45] SpringSong: or lux with banshe kekw
[1:01:49] phunktional: that's pretty good
[1:02:00] phunktional: more effective traps too?
[1:02:06] shanenaniganss: I think nashors looks better
[1:02:21] SpringSong: but nashor atk speed kinda nice but lich banes movespeed kinda very nice too idk
[1:02:55] phunktional: I think nashor laundry is close enough
[1:03:00] SpringSong: wat is R dmg?
[1:03:08] SpringSong: only R diff
[1:03:25] churchfir3: ALOO
[1:03:37] churchfir3: Buhhrger
[1:03:39] KappxV: what if we switch banshees for nashors

[1:03:54] churchfir3: @BadassKetchup BUHHLOO
[1:04:03] SpringSong: I would go for nashor liandry
[1:04:07] shanenaniganss: thats a lot better, yeah?
[1:04:14] zzaun333: riot will take away def runs next patch
[1:04:20] sadmaseo: not using Malign ?
[1:04:58] phunktional: whoa
[1:05:04] shanenaniganss: thats crazy
[1:05:06] SpringSong: nah deathcap is needed
[1:05:06] phunktional: 1117/860
[1:05:13] regulus_moonbeam: low elo all the time xD
[1:05:14] SpringSong: ppl wont stand on that circle
[1:05:44] sadmaseo: but the shrooms slows, maybe around 1 sec worth
[1:05:55] shanenaniganss: I think we have to go with the consistency of dcap
[1:05:56] YolkBun: MYAAA
[1:06:24] SpringSong: but teemos ap ratio already low and malignant gives huge R haste so idk
[1:07:24] sadmaseo: also pure AP teemo cant burst bruiser right
[1:07:38] sadmaseo: truuee
[1:08:08] MisterMarcess: what rune is good vs hyper tanks?
[1:08:19] SpringSong: so either we gona replace nashor with deathcap or deathcap with malignant
[1:08:42] SpringSong: shadowflame only better after %35 hp
[1:08:51] yashaomegalul: on-hit ad not viable anymore compare to ap? ipavEww
[1:08:57] phunktional: @MisterMarcess lethal tempo?
[1:09:24] MisterMarcess: rlly?
[1:09:33] SpringSong: so important question is playstyle are we need that shroom around map?
[1:09:42] SpringSong: or we want to use q and aa's?
[1:10:02] SpringSong: if we want shroom malignant important
[1:10:15] SpringSong: if we gona focus on more aa's and q we dont need malignant
[1:11:22] shanenaniganss: What if you assume the enemy is in the malg circle for half the time?
[1:11:32] tobyteemo: korean teemo does nashor malignance
[1:11:36] tobyteemo: with pta
[1:11:49] SpringSong: I think shroom is important even if enemy keep clean map they lost time with doing it and we have vision so malignant is core item imo
[1:12:22] SpringSong: @shanenaniganss we dont want malignant for circle dmg we need it for 40 haste R
[1:12:44] SpringSong: R cd gona get nerfed so we need that haste even more
[1:14:09] SpringSong: but if we go stormsurge shadow flame kinda needed both work verywell to playstyle of that items
[1:16:47] SpringSong: ipavNoted
[1:16:47] Sushi_AssAssin: What is best teemo build for jg now?
[1:17:24] cosmanoide: Fleet show rune tree for fleet plssssssss

[1:24:02] Ephera1: hi ipav! How do you work around champions with more than 3 MR items? Feels like the new mr tank items are impossible to bypass even with void staff lol
[1:28:40] Ephera1: :')
[1:29:30] sadmaseo: do you know there is unfair item just to counter AP, names Kinetic something
[1:29:31] SpringSong: they need to delete galio passive item ipavREE ipavS
[1:30:12] Ephera1: @sadmaseo kaenic rookern?
[1:30:45] sadmaseo: yes @ephera1  that one, low cd too
[1:30:47] SpringSong: and varus ez
[1:31:27] SpringSong: its a galio passive
[1:32:34] Ephera1: @sadmaseo that item makes me cry lol
[1:33:29] sadmaseo: i dont mind the item if its work similiar with Seraph
[1:33:44] SpringSong: @sadmaseo its better than seraph
[1:33:45] sadmaseo: but its not NotLikeThis
[1:33:54] SpringSong: seraph has loooong cd
[1:34:19] SpringSong: but that item just need 7 sec outfight or something like that
[1:34:46] SpringSong: and it gives much more shield like I saw it on zac player with 800 shield

[4:45:00] VoodooChild420: they want for ego yeah
[4:45:25] VoodooChild420: i also notice some cultures like to shows off rank it makes them feel important like they achieve something
[4:45:37] Warmaull: well then, do you prefer stomp games in normal / low rank and smurf accounts, or hard fought lanes / wins
[4:47:27] Warmaull: ya i understand that, but when you play ranked isnt it meant to balance  you against the opponent?
[4:47:48] Warmaull: i did not know that
[4:48:02] Warmaull: i dont think its against new players but i think its 100% random
[4:48:03] Aldurfus: normal has mmr lol
[4:48:06] Lazynameross: a lot of folks unlock ranked then only play that
[4:48:13] Lazynameross: and their norm mmr stays low
[4:48:14] Warmaull: ya i didnt know normal has mmr
[4:48:21] Warmaull: i thought its just whoever is cue for normal gets put in game
[4:49:05] SzDredd: teetoHi
[4:49:18] S_N_0_O_P_Y: @Warmaull Unranked has it's own MMR.
[4:49:34] Warmaull: thats 100% the other extreme though
[4:49:50] Warmaull: i didnt think that, i just didnt know normal had mmr
[4:50:05] Warmaull: thats cool though, when i played league i only played norm games haha
[4:50:18] Warmaull: ranked gives too much anxiety and the community can pounce on any mess up
[4:50:23] Warmaull: makes it not fun to play
[4:51:30] Warmaull: even in your 1 kill game against garen though where he had 5 kill, you out cs and i assume more useful to your team right?
[4:52:15] Warmaull: i really enjoy watching your games where it seems bleak early but then you fight it out for a win

[7:15:44] PhilosoPhiddle: I might be totally wrong. Terminus might be amazing on Teemo. It seems to stack much faster than I thought it would. And on hit teemo is one of the few champs that does near half AD/AP.
