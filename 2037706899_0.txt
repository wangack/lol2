[1:53:47] fragileweeb: it's just what bwipo said, if you try to survive with defensive items, she will farm 25 cs/min and oneshot your whole team while you still cant do anything
[1:53:48] ITSMEMUMU0: I feel like her shield is the problem imo

[1:53:51] klhonoa: nah adc crying that something is broken when adc was broken for like 4 years rizz
[1:53:56] shining_lettuce_12: The worst part is that they refuse to nerf her
[1:53:56] WidiFire: no riven is broken they buffed her for no reason
[1:54:09] ihopeyourehappynow: eclipse is so massive rn on its own for her, she gets one item spikes imo
[1:54:09] MrStealYoToast: Sundered sky should have been nerfed by now but it probably looks worse than it really is because its bugged on half the champs
[1:54:10] Biltulescu: is he still playing?
[1:54:10] Nightbot: yes? no? idk
[1:54:13] lidaros: ban her
