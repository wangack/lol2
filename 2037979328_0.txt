[7:11:49] ThreshHookedMe: Can anyone explain to me why I can’t build Tri-Force on Ashe as supp ? (might have to do with the ward item completion because before that it’s not shown as locked)
[7:12:07] Lazynameross: bloodsong is sheen item
[7:12:07] noobuprising: !delay

[7:12:29] deepwaters: stutn forgets to ban once and suddenly theres a blitzcrank
[7:12:31] deepwaters: hehe
[7:12:36] ThreshHookedMe: But I can’t after the ward item completion so that’s why I’m asking why
[7:12:38] ThomasTheTwink: it’s gonna be psycho Anivia and blitz Botlane
[7:12:52] archimedes_9: poppyDance
[7:13:03] Lazynameross: if you have 1 sheen item youre not allowed tobuild another
[7:13:08] cloudydaisies: stuntRakan2
[7:13:17] voidmoons: do u like this rakan skin william
[7:13:24] ThreshHookedMe: @lazynameross it was my first item
[7:13:27] coolalp123: what's that mark next to your skins?
[7:13:27] ash_chiming: unique passive tho
[7:13:30] zionthegod: it does take a very long time to progress in that game
[7:13:46] Lazynameross: right now if you have sheen bought then finish blood song it wont let you upgrade it into anything
[7:14:02] Lazynameross: usually items like this they lock eventually like just 1 tear item
[7:14:04] TheTazzyBoy: bloodsong isn't *sheen* though is it
[7:14:08] som963: does nami go dream maker or bloodsong?
[7:14:11] Lazynameross: idk if bug i figured it was intentional
[7:14:17] ash_chiming: “whose bottom?” 🤔
[7:14:23] xCaeIum: I love it stuntCry
[7:14:25] PharmDRPh: mobies anivia supp again?

[7:14:54] Boosh_lol: t1 Pog
[7:14:57] ThreshHookedMe: @lazynameross I think so as well. Was just wondering if anyone knows the actual reason why
[7:15:21] Hook123: It's clearly not T1 it's 1T Kappa
[7:15:31] deepwaters: nope
[7:15:32] Lazynameross: you used to be able to build like triforce+lich+ibg but it would only use 1 proc
[7:15:36] ThomasTheTwink: yes
[7:15:40] TheTazzyBoy: its so good
[7:15:41] DesuLaDesu: they're very good but expensive

[7:16:40] Thommenius: Same adc as well
[7:16:47] ThreshHookedMe: @lazynameross I agree and this makes absolute sense but not being able to finish tri force as first item on Ashe supp doesn’t really make sense in my brain
[7:16:48] Lazynameross: arent thes wx players wintraders or something
[7:16:51] waveofpanic: didnt the anivia get mobility boots or something
[7:16:54] Boosh_lol: yh they duo
