[5:04:44] Kroptik: @Sator141 Yes, they did a fantastic job. I assume all 24 episodes will just be the 2 first LNs... and there's 8 more volumes out, so imagine the content rooPog
[5:04:52] Sator141: i didnt finished the second season of spyxfamily because it so boring to me @squallnight9

[5:05:38] Sator141: @Kroptik i highly think then there will be a second season too, since the anime is so popular and loved already too Pog
[5:06:01] squallnight9: @Sator141 haha ya its not for everyone
[5:06:17] MortymorRobotron: ksanted
[5:06:22] Kroptik: @Sator141 I hope so, if they animate volume 3 and 4 it'll be amazing... though the 4th volume ends in a cliffhanger, so you'd need a season 3. LUL
[5:06:26] grtz123: LOL i was wondering why ksante was tower diving you then i forgot he could ult to safety
[5:06:29] Sator141: @grtz123 for me yeah, and the end of first season got also boring to me already, was hard to watch. i totally understand why u didnt u finshed
[5:06:56] Kroptik: Spy x Family suffered from what a lot of anime suffer... "It's episodic now."
[5:06:59] grtz123: @Sator141 ah okie, it was good though! i just don't have much free time haha
[5:07:16] Sator141: @Kroptik thats sounds great tho. lots of content for us Pog Clap
