[0:53:24] lightpunch00: @yoslo1, actually improving means not playing on autopilot actively looking critically on yourself. rewatch ur own games to see what you could do better.

[0:57:58] ChameleonLac: @yoslo1 as you can see, some people one trick, others multitask, from what I see it is the people who enjoy themselves that are truly winning. It seems as if you are feeling defeated, which makes it harder to learn or have fun. Maybe find what you love and do it, even if you lose.
[0:57:59] twirlypanda: i'm a top main, got to gold really easy but in gold team feeds too hard while i'm on my island, started playing hook supports and roamed often, completely free getting to plat

[2:03:56] PrayWMe: !thinking
[2:03:56] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.

[2:28:54] PrayWMe: are htye bo barnb
[2:29:02] mlgnoobscope: bo bamb
[2:29:06] PrayWMe: !thinking
[2:29:06] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.
[2:29:07] IV_Coxx: !jax
[2:29:07] Nightbot: when he es just run with w, ult his ult. DONT q HIS E ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.

[2:29:54] IV_Coxx: !nasus
[2:29:54] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists

[2:31:25] AdersX: @GuaCaMuLLy vlad is 12
