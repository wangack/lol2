[0:49:56] qda__: people who dont go outside think its cringe 100%
[0:50:02] Howtoad: imo, ask her if you can ask her out, you tell her + you request a date immediately
[0:50:04] renzadicnetwork: gotta be up front
[0:50:05] qda__: KEKW
[0:50:08] tonzster: so something sensational make her notice
[0:50:09] Morvias: Pog
[0:50:11] Girz0r: Long term, GTARP is pretty good. I've always appreciated some of the RP  OGs. Having fitting music, presenting a show of character. Going above & beyond etc. It's really good if you're deep into a rp story SeemsGood
[0:50:11] Meyern3: pepeMeltdown fuck it is right behind the corner
[0:50:13] jkdstealth1: Lol Cady

[0:50:25] xasapwilliex: might as well say how you feel and then if it's bad just move on'
[0:50:29] Morvias: Never stop going big dick Asmonting
[0:50:30] locouseking69: thats the grown up way of doing it
[0:50:30] StriderH1ryu: KEKW
[0:50:31] mikenachos: respect
[0:50:32] burnerror: feel that KEKW
[0:50:34] sleepi0ne: Maybe ask someone who understands rejection?
[0:50:39] tonzster: hot air balloing is alway a good first date
[0:50:43] Girz0r: I think you'll do great in GTARP SeemsGood
[0:50:45] Daara87: just be prepared to lose your friend
[0:50:50] Daara87: because that happens
[0:50:52] StriderH1ryu: youre already doomed going to a twitch chat for advise Kappa
[0:50:56] HapyJone: yo

[0:51:29] StriderH1ryu: kinda?
[0:51:33] Daara87: guys are so easy
[0:51:35] cursedmoon13: Telling them has never worked for me. They say "let's stay friends" which would be fine, but then they gradually become more distant until they're gone.
[0:51:35] Daara87: just compliment them
[0:51:40] Daara87: and they'll never forget
[0:51:41] daveisdavis: exactly, your ego is too big /sarcasm
[0:51:42] mikenachos: maybe there is a courting 101 vid on YT or somethin

[0:51:50] Girz0r: jamGood
[0:51:52] jkdstealth1: Lol it's hit or miss
[0:52:33] qda__: LOL
[0:52:37] Howtoad: @cursedmoon13 but at the same time, the alternative is what, keep it secret, build up emotions until it explodes and then rip friendship anyway
[0:52:39] tonzster: ouch the friendzone
[0:52:39] TheFangdom: its just a shitty feeling tho that the thought of the person you thought you knew was only there so they could get with u
[0:52:39] Aegatron: :p
[0:52:43] jkdstealth1: Idk I've stayed friends with a friend after we hooked up...it can happen..
[0:52:48] TheFangdom: so dont be that person
[0:52:48] Meyern3: ICANT
[0:53:07] mikenachos: put it out there and let em decide
[0:53:13] ZeliusX22: Uh oh, did we lose Brian?
[0:53:15] Xastin3: i told girl i had feeling for her, were still friends but we hardly talk anymore
[0:53:19] cursedmoon13: @jkdstealth1  I think a hookup is different.
[0:53:29] crimsonhope94: Can't have feelings for your friends, gotta separate the love
[0:53:30] tonzster: its a line you never cross unless you know of the result
[0:53:38] jkdstealth1: @cursedmoon13 how so
[0:53:45] funkyfruit__: how long you been with brian?
[0:53:46] Girz0r: Good on him, though the outcome is what it is. SeemsGood
[0:53:50] TheFangdom: i agree but that shouldnt be your only motive for being friends but also if you decide to cross that boundary then you have to be ok with whatever the outcome is
[0:54:11] jkdstealth1: That's true Cady
[0:54:14] Fossabot: @rufio_ow, $(sender), Please ask for permission to post a link.
[0:54:16] jkdstealth1: I agree
[0:54:16] Somanie: there's a little truth to that statement because I was ugly in middle school and when I told a guy I liked him he ran out of the gym and hated me for 3 years lol

[0:54:41] NutterCircus: I cant believe you are still awake Fandy. Arent you beat?
[0:54:49] tonzster: absolutely
[0:54:50] jerckysminion: yup it's highly obvious
[0:54:51] Howtoad: yeah cus girls are so direct and easy to deal with Kappa
[0:54:52] TheFangdom: its obvious to everyone except the guy
[0:54:56] StriderH1ryu: read the signs. ez
[0:54:57] Girz0r: Yup
[0:54:57] Meyern3: so clingy...
[0:54:57] kangaroobird: What do you consider friends tho. A girl whos not interested in me and is flaky and barely talks is not a friend
[0:55:01] mikenachos: @TheFangdom truuuuue
[0:55:04] jkdstealth1: Obvious for another woman to detect not so obvious for a man lol
[0:55:04] qda__: I dont believe that at all
[0:55:05] tonzster: men dont
[0:55:19] qda__: people do take it worse
[0:55:27] LRKNc: I think that sometimes women think they are be obvious, but we are oblivious
[0:55:31] DavidLeshman: Hello fandy stephleeWave zrvkkHeart
[0:55:36] jerckysminion: why u harrassing people in the gym yo
[0:55:43] TheFangdom: yeah we are stupid
[0:55:46] jerckysminion: men are there to workout not be interrupted.....
[0:55:52] cursedmoon13: @jkdstealth1  if you hooked up it means they were at least attracted to you enough to hook up, but if you just tell them, the one-sidedness makes them always think you're trying to get with them and they're not.
[0:55:53] ace50: it be like that
[0:55:58] jkdstealth1: Like if a woman liked me and they weren't so keen to communication it would be hard for me to get the hints
[0:56:00] Somanie: @jerckysminion I was in middle school and my friends asked me who I liked then ratted me out Sadge
[0:56:02] NutterCircus: LMAO
[0:56:03] rufio_ow: Hey Fandy just wanna say I really like you YUMP
[0:56:12] qda__: I had a point in life where I would just rapid fire shot my shoot lmao sometimes you miss and sometimes you make fk it
[0:56:15] Meyern3: they are not direct
[0:56:19] CyresTheVirus_: I have to ask....what's with the eye liner elv look...because I just dont get it.
[0:56:21] Xastin3: so direct... when their goto is to not say what they mean
[0:56:33] Daara87: she was working on her ass
[0:56:34] crimsonhope94: I always propose the self-question: why do you like them
[0:56:37] Daara87: not harassing people
[0:56:39] jerckysminion: @Somanie RiP
[0:56:40] kangaroobird: Wtf fandy harrassing guyz in the gym? Smh

[0:56:48] NoWhalebone: Isn't it more obvious that a girl likes you if you are a girl? I feel like the signs of someone liking someone is more apparent to the same sex, and not to the other?
[0:56:53] Somanie: bruh no I harassed someone in the gym when I was 11 it's ok
[0:56:57] crimsonhope94: And then ask if you dated would that change
[0:57:01] Somanie: Fandy did nothing lol

[0:57:44] Meyern3: NODDERS
[0:57:48] Scyneir: miz not a real person, gotcha Kappa
[0:58:02] crimsonhope94: If course all this is assuming long term.
[0:58:08] jkdstealth1: I mean I guess there are subtle cues of attraction I can sense , however unless they don't tell me,I'm just assuming...
[0:58:14] rufio_ow: @Fandy Who was your first video game crush? Mine was Cortana in Halo
[0:58:19] GasClubAtl: the females at the gym be the real motivation üòí

[0:58:28] Xastin3: got that game feels bad
[0:58:34] NutterCircus: This PalWorld thing is disturbing.

[1:23:49] grey_katt: yeah most guys don't like feeling like a gurl is milking you for your bank vibes.
[1:23:51] TheFangdom: streaming is talkint AT people thats different
[1:23:59] davidi9: Many people who do that job are ruthless when it comes to getting money

[1:24:05] Daara87: @rufio_ow wow nerds can't afford clubs

[1:25:11] TheFangdom: and if u dont have thick skin u need to grow it fast
[1:25:13] Artiiz: The internet can be a cruel place yeah
[1:25:16] lilyosa: NODDERS

[1:26:29] grey_katt: some of those gurls thinking i don't have a brain as well..
[1:26:29] healful1: i feel unless u get lucky in order to be succesful at streaming u have to be a attractive female there are not many streamers that consistantly have 1200 people just chilling in there chat usually its around a couple hundred

[1:27:37] healful1: thats lucky breaks
[1:27:37] Twisted_Rider: some
[1:27:40] Daara87: being a waiter/waitress will toughen you up pretty quick
[1:27:41] qda__: i have 0 idea why ret got buffed lool
[1:27:42] no1xxdeathxx1on: Your beautiful though thats for sure
[1:27:45] Hordiix: @lilyosa pretty big, like 5% single target buff, aoe like 2-4% maybe
[1:27:48] rufio_ow: Nah thats bullshit. Look at hte top directory of steamers and see how many are dudes
[1:27:54] Xastin3: the big guys found their thing and  built community
[1:28:01] Skypirinha4: i think u have to remember that its probably a 9 year old kid who call u a W- word . gives a grim outlook on the world when u see how kids have 0 respect but its just kids beeing kids mostly...
[1:28:03] Daara87: @qda__ r shaman 5%!!!!
[1:28:04] TheFangdom: high floor low ceiling
[1:28:06] crimsonhope94: Quality vs quantity
[1:28:20] Twisted_Rider: eshand hes at 9.8k
[1:28:20] grey_katt: depends on whom and what
[1:28:20] Xastin3: r shaman 5% still doesnt matter
[1:28:28] Daara87: yeah it needed to be like 15%
[1:28:31] Xastin3: ret looking pretty interesting
[1:28:32] Girz0r: Providing entertaining content or value is number one bros SeemsGood It's up to you.

[1:28:49] Twisted_Rider: you 1.2kl
[1:28:56] rufio_ow: Also womean have to deal WAY more bullshit than male streamers do Sadge
[1:29:01] Twisted_Rider: so your doing alright
[1:29:08] crimsonhope94: Stretch
[1:29:09] Xastin3: all the buffs felt like bandaids with exception maybe ret and shadow
[1:29:11] Artiiz: Annie said a quite good thing about that, she thinks Twitch is way more for men than Youtube for example
[1:29:12] Hordiix: @qda__ ret is pretty meh overall, and their single target in keys is absolutely abysmal, and will still be after this buff
[1:29:14] healful1: idk i know when i was streaming i had a top of like 2-300 viewers but it wasnt that consistant
[1:29:19] grey_katt: @davidi9 some of us look at personality traits of people too
[1:29:24] SigmaBirdmanCnB13: Hey goddess. Hope you're good :)
[1:29:28] Skypirinha4: i dont fully agree there have been big female streamers often guy streamers just put in tons of hours... like XQC it means a lot : social bounding and stuff...

[1:29:55] Girz0r: Nobody likes hot & bland food
[1:29:56] Twisted_Rider: ya your the best out of your
[1:29:56] beetoxictv: People say looking hot makes u big on twitch, but the biggest streamers are dudes.
[1:30:03] no1xxdeathxx1on: True but you do have it
[1:30:09] davidi9: you can be gorgeous and toxic
[1:30:12] Daara87: if you don't interact with your chat you're going to have a much tougher time
[1:30:18] Ghost5392: Plenty of 'hot' women around. You need to be also quirky, or very charismatic, or entertaining in some other form.
[1:30:22] grey_katt: some gurls piss of their veiwers by joking about their own chat too much
[1:30:23] lilyosa: holy fuck huge hpriest buffs
[1:30:24] beetoxictv: It's about entertaining
[1:30:27] Artiiz: To get big on Twitch now you kind of have to stick out
[1:30:29] Artiiz: Kind of like what Doc did
[1:30:30] rufio_ow: @Fandy tbh people don't give people like Alinity or Amouranth enough credit for being actually entertaining and hard working. It's not just looks they take it beyond that
[1:30:33] Xastin3: netowrking makes big difference too in streaming. there so many people i follow that i would never found if they didnt network
[1:30:33] StriderH1ryu: long time doesnt matter these days. have to be lucky and original
[1:30:36] NutterCircus: I know some very pretty female streamers and they have less than 100 followers, so it isnt just booba.
[1:30:50] StriderH1ryu: exactly. stick out. like extraem
[1:30:56] grey_katt: there is like haha with you then haha at you vibes..
[1:30:57] Artiiz: yeah like being in an org or something
[1:31:03] beetoxictv: You were able to raid on hardcore, not many women on twitch do that content
[1:31:10] Elohimmel: how do you feel about OnlyFangs sorta ending like that?

[1:31:15] crimsonhope94: Saw a streamer do a 8 hour bar hop stream in Austin
[1:31:19] Hordiix: honestly u can be the best streamer in the world and still sit at 0 viewers if you do nothing else to bring people in
[1:31:23] crimsonhope94: So just go for it
