[6:46:12] biggestsugar: @b1tten I must be missing something. Azir has little to no "mechanics" to him? I personally find him a simple champ but very hard to execute.
[6:46:33] biggestsugar: Are "mechanics" the same as micro?
[6:46:36] testplayer457: easy to see when opponent jungle respawn after clearing it

[6:50:39] MagnumXXS: thanks nightbot kekw
[6:50:40] b1tten: @biggestsugar mechanics are champion ability usage, combos etc (lee's insec, azir's ult combos), things that require reaction time and "mechanical" skill to pull off
[6:51:23] b1tten: @biggestsugar if only the most mechanically skilled players can achieve the highest performance on a champ, that champ is mechanicallyn difficult. thats what i mean

[6:53:03] biggestsugar: @b1tten that would also be called micro so in that case, yes you are right. Azir is difficult on a micro level.
