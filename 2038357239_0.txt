[1:35:37] Halofan642: at least youre doing a win, game played would be criminalk
[1:35:58] 9fierce9: He hates Graves because he hit challanger with him instead of a champ he likes Kappa
[1:36:06] ameliaaaaa_2738: If there's one thing to know about 5up its that he despises Graves with every fibre in his body
[1:36:20] BluerBlack: hwei is the lowest win % on  moba KEKW

[2:08:49] PoteetLee: Damn
[2:08:50] Tirmel: It makes more sense that you'd pay for a Graves win now
[2:08:54] balletbunny: thats the spirit!
[2:09:33] divax0x0: That's my mentality for my suffering while watching movies if I have to suffer someone is suffering with me
