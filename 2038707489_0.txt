[3:06:10] InterludetoPeace: Wow how is he remembering these characters
[3:06:18] InterludetoPeace: Looks complicated
[3:08:38] pikapika_666_: is traditional Chinese writing common in mainland academia? Or only learned in specific departments?
[3:09:18] lok1021: there is phonic above the word, it should help a lot
[3:10:22] OrbitalPeacock: @pikapika_666_ Apparently chatgpt says it's the latter and they use simplified chinese for almost everything
[3:11:10] OrbitalPeacock: we need simplified english tbh
[3:11:54] lok1021: China is using simplified Chinese as official language, so they not really know about traditional Chinese
[3:12:01] pikapika_666_: a chinese wrote in a post somewhere that although they don't use them often, most people can read the traditional characters.
[3:15:20] lok1021: because both character are similar, so they can recognize the word
