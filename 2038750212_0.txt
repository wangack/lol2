[2:03:10] Lt_Sharp: Hwei was cool though
[2:03:14] NPSJason: @Don_Savik sure but at that point being 4v5 down against Azir/Aphelios is also rough, Sylas making that call was pure int

[3:36:37] Fr0stWulf: bronze amount of deaths
[3:36:39] Straata0123: literally 50% of team deaths
[3:36:41] T_blazian: @Oglino Looking this guy keeps saying words but they don't make any sense man. Shruge must not be english
[3:36:49] Hellifyoudont66: The only difference I can see between Emerald and Bronze is people know how to itemize enough that deaths are instant. Kill counts and vision seem about the same, though. stripLUL
[3:37:22] sack02: probably not tbh
[3:37:23] sack02: yeah

[3:37:44] bearonvonbear: Shruge Items
[3:37:48] TheMadBadger: @Hellifyoudont66 The other difference is that people in emerald/diamond elo have just enough of an ego to know they're good enough to brag/flame
[3:37:51] FilthySerf: sure would be nice to see a breakdown of what item did what
[3:38:08] Hellifyoudont66: @Hellifyoudont66 Bronze players THINK they're good enough to flame. stripFufu

[3:39:45] CompulsiveOne: yeah all jung players are mentally broken after years of abuse LUL
[3:39:57] TheMadBadger: That feels like it's proof Rengar player is riding the champs coat-tails. He does basic things and gets carried by items but can't dodge skillshots dazeLul
[3:39:58] Straata0123: Yeah i don't know how you abuse meta.. if its in the game and not an exploit
[3:40:44] TheMadBadger: @Straata0123 Nothing wrong with playing meta, just don't act like you're a god gamer for playing the easiest champs rn

[3:42:06] TheMadBadger: @FilthySerf Baby Dragon is dumb
[3:42:11] zlucas01: I think he should spend more time to detilt
[3:42:20] Broke99: Baby dragon is cool
[3:42:25] unkilledcrow: bring the 500 hz back
