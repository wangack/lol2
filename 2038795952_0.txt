[2:49:05] dannz_plays: yo how do i make my team to not say jg diff when im doing the most dmg in the game?
[2:49:14] dannz_plays: and doing decent
[2:49:55] Visions_Of_V_: @dannz_plays Unfortunately thats just how the game is. If you want them to stop saying jg diff. Play a different role
[2:50:05] Visions_Of_V_: Firmware update completed

[2:52:10] StrifepacK: silver easier then bronze
[2:52:15] kyle40k: brand jg godspeed
[2:52:33] dannz_plays: i do blame myself for playing bad at times
[2:52:33] Visions_Of_V_: @dannz_plays Well if you want me to be honest and transparent with you. Silver is an easy role to climb out of compared to any other. You must have some mistakes happening that are preventing you fro snowballing/climbing etc
[2:52:45] dannz_plays: but when i dont i lose 27 to 30 lp for nothing
[2:52:51] Visions_Of_V_: Fixing these issues will help you climb, but you need to acknowledge them and actively work to fix them

[2:53:48] Visions_Of_V_: @dannz_plays Jg is the hardest role to learn bro. there is pathing. There is gank timers. Skuttle timers. Drag timers. Voidling timers. There is a lot to take in with that role

[2:55:03] Visions_Of_V_: @dannz_plays Then you give it
[2:55:10] dannz_plays: sadge
[2:55:24] Visions_Of_V_: @dannz_plays Several top players like Sanchovies for example say that voidlings are shit anyway and overhyped for what they are
[2:55:28] dannz_plays: then they say jg diff lol
[2:55:29] Straley: @RefuJudas your dog ass gameplay makes it hard to distinguish you from a silver player regardless of whatever rank you got boosted to
[2:55:45] Visions_Of_V_: Some jungles can sneak objectives but you need to be playing them. Not all jgls can do that
[2:55:49] dannz_plays: coz no obj they say jg diff lmao
[2:55:49] kyle40k: @Straley  RIPBOZO
[2:55:50] Ryuzakiblade: How go the games?
[2:56:08] RefuJudas: @Straley keep yourself safe!
[2:56:10] Visions_Of_V_: @dannz_plays Like ww can sneak obj
[2:56:13] Visions_Of_V_: Sej cant
[2:56:30] Visions_Of_V_: It comes with playing the game and learning
[2:56:44] Visions_Of_V_: You can also learn a lot from watching someone like Dantes who mains the jg role
[2:56:56] RefuJudas: @Straley whyd you have to go so hard lmfao
[2:57:32] Visions_Of_V_: @dannz_plays Even Nightblue3 can teach you a lot if you just watch what he does. You dont need to listen to what he says. Just think about what hes doing and why hes doing it
[2:57:35] RefuJudas: thats asian on asian crime right there @Straley
[2:57:52] Visions_Of_V_: @RefuJudas Call that double rice
