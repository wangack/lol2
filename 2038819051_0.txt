[0:07:15] liftliftenjoyer: yeah that baron was the most promising part of the game, looked like a world class team there
[0:07:24] pr3hist0ric: do you think sera bot lanes are just cause of double support item?
[0:07:28] sigmaballs2: is lucian milio meant to win that lane harder?
[0:07:31] lilacMegan: @Cherpz i was shocked with how much quid has improved
[0:07:45] itsArji: any upsets in ur opinion today?
[0:08:06] rembestg1rl: is Lucian Milio super good?

[0:09:14] Leandre: gg
[0:09:19] Cherpz: @lilacmegan yeah he looked like a completely new version of himself. I guess having a new jg made that big of a difference

[0:12:35] lilacMegan: @Aldernade that would be wild...
[0:12:48] Cherpz: Btw what was the reasoning behind picking naut into milio? it didnt show on stage obviously but isnt the matchup supposed to be losing?
[0:12:49] portilho: wait oop
[0:13:09] bohnzohn: Vulcan crushing it today and already right back at the grind. What do you think about playing on the live patch?

[0:31:23] rembestg1rl: the casting desk talked about it a little bit, Lucian has the smallest range almost of any AD, so it’s super easy to get hooked as Lucian in that regard

[0:46:04] sluonyou: Riot will punish him all good !
[0:46:13] equilibrium824: 30min delay.. even when the game was ending in like 5min. KEKW
[0:46:23] lilacMegan: the pauses without talking seems so stressful
[0:46:32] liftliftenjoyer: yeah makes sense. when they let you talk today after a while, can you talk about the game or still no?
[0:46:39] Jedski: are you allowed to think about the game Kappa

[0:47:01] Fammy: Plus they dont know if you have signals in your speech. Maybe you turn and say "Blaber I have to take a shit". That might mean "Come gank bot they have no flash"
[0:47:04] KuhzLoL: @Vulcan_LoL Can you give a quick summary of how to play double support item bot lane for this patch? :)
[0:47:05] sluonyou: no thinking the ref can catch that

[0:55:02] sluonyou: real
[0:55:14] Asyc: lowkey

[0:56:10] lilacMegan: my silly trans rock lady i will die for you
[0:56:18] ohsomagical_: they were getting dunked on 90% of the game right ?
[0:56:21] SpazzDoesTwitch: @lilacmegan it’s reasonable to fight bugs but if the game gets remade- they take a game where they’re in a very much losing position to starting from scratch. it’s happened before in pro games for a reason
[0:56:23] DoubleDe3: NRG seemed happy to get week 1 done.
[0:56:25] chan_: @Asyc you will be
