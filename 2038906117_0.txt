[3:13:33] pallasfr: JoelPride
[3:13:33] romana32: JoelPrider
[3:13:39] havokthetoast: NOOOO
[3:13:41] BlueSNS: @shmichaelbyers no fucking remorse in her heart, i've seen whats in there. NO kindness
[3:13:41] romana32: JoelPrider JoelPrider
[3:13:44] readerotl: time to pack it in boys
[3:13:49] shmichaelbyers: @BlueSNS @subawuba u guys hate me
[3:13:50] klyde1337: jupijej
[3:13:51] readerotl: JoelPrider
[3:13:52] subawuba: basically what blue said
[3:13:57] shmichaelbyers: JoelPrider
[3:13:57] emma_4444_: gamba pls :)
[3:13:58] pixeluwu: Sadge doodoo
[3:13:59] romana32: JoelPrider
[3:14:00] spagbollo: @pallasfr how did you know Susge
[3:14:03] pixeluwu: jupijej
[3:14:03] AntonyTLK1: I think the problem wasnt veigar but the fiddle that died 5 times to Draven early game
[3:14:07] BlueSNS: @shmichaelbyers yeah kinda. owo
[3:14:09] fighting_fafnir: time for Bedge gn yall
[3:14:11] 1TheRedFox: @PekinWoof Do you think turrets should be stronger so that its actually scary for champs to dive?
[3:14:11] subawuba: @shmichaelbyers it's out of love
[3:14:16] shmichaelbyers: @BlueSNS wtfff
[3:14:24] BlueSNS: @BlueSNS :33
[3:14:24] shmichaelbyers: @fighting_fafnir nighty night ! rest well
[3:14:25] the_unstoppable_t_rex: pekinSway2 pekinSway2 pekinSway2
[3:14:28] pixeluwu: @fighting_fafnir gn Bedge
[3:14:42] Unilateralis: turrests should do true fqamage
[3:14:43] AntonyTLK1: @1theredfox they were buffed like 1 year ago PEKW
[3:14:46] shmichaelbyers: i love coconut mall guys
[3:14:46] Unilateralis: true damage
[3:14:49] emma_4444_: @1theredfox they buffed towers last season for that reason
[3:14:50] Polaris78: !game
[3:14:51] Nightbot: @Polaris78 -> There was an error connecting to Twitch's API. Try again later.
[3:14:53] laraehsobrenome: they should bring back the old turret
[3:14:58] pallasfr: @spagbollo cuz i saw spagbowl recile in my tiktok
[3:15:07] shmichaelbyers: @Unilateralis yes but also no
[3:15:10] subawuba: tiny rogues does look kinda fun
[3:15:14] pallasfr: is like bolognese without vegies
[3:15:14] 1TheRedFox: I think turrets should still be able to target champs even if they go untargetable. The only thing that should stop turret dmg is like bard ult or zhonyas or Kayle ult.
[3:15:17] the_unstoppable_t_rex: tourettes should do % hp dmg based on who it is hitting
[3:15:21] subawuba: maybe it is time to add another game to the eternal library
[3:15:42] greeeeble: +1 actor
[3:15:44] AntonyTLK1: Why the hell the game looks so clean where are my pixels Smadge ?
[3:15:44] greeeeble: yuge
[3:15:54] spagbollo: @pallasfr never seen that before but now that I think about it the abbreviation spagbol/spagbowl does sound british KEKL

[3:16:06] pixeluwu: @antonytlk1 hi :)
[3:16:06] Unilateralis: i think turrets should kill my enemies buyt not me
[3:16:10] pallasfr: OMG SPELL BLADE LIKE LEAGUE OF LEGNDS OMG pekinPEKW
[3:16:14] emma_4444_: if you’re ahead enough to win a dive then it’s fine to win it @1theredfox
[3:16:14] AntonyTLK1: @pixeluwu lwk
[3:16:17] AntonyTLK1: owo
[3:16:19] Zarnotox: !q
[3:16:19] Nightbot: Tiny Rogues
[3:16:25] shmichaelbyers: @pallasfr NO WAY!!!
[3:16:33] 1TheRedFox: @emma_4444_ yea but some champs can dive even when not ahead. That's the issue imo
[3:16:41] the_unstoppable_t_rex: turrets should be replaced by a milking table
[3:16:56] subawuba: armor like league of legends yall

[3:18:44] AntonyTLK1: I would AhriLickL galioGrippers AhriLickR galio feet all day
[3:18:45] spagbollo: @pallasfr I named my clash of clans account that because I like the dish and it stuck, nice to be reminded of it peepoBlush
[3:18:45] emma_4444_: true fizz is fucking annoying
