[6:15:36] NotASnekIRL: how does that happen to "specific" accounts?
[6:18:27] LordMcWilliams: How many Riot employees mothers have to slept with, Wings
[6:18:30] NotASnekIRL: i'm not saying they'd be going after people, but they could be just trying to manipulate the ladder and fucked up
[6:18:54] LordMcWilliams: Okay, so they ain't targeting you.
[6:18:56] NotASnekIRL: that's why i said that could have been done on purpose
[6:19:43] LordMcWilliams: It's the "no player left behind" approach to ranking.
[6:21:21] LordMcWilliams: As long as you queue up, Riot tries to give you a chance to climb (silver to gold to platinum to emerald to whatever).
[6:21:38] sartrik: wideNessie
