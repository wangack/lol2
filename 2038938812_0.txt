[0:08:35] imainleesin: @CrazyTheConfused it was truly horrifying to watch LUL
[0:08:42] littleindianman12: Any predictions on KT vs DK tomorrow?
[0:08:57] imainleesin: games with DIG/IMT in them dont really count as games imo
[0:09:13] 치지지지직: Did you know chinese streaming platform doesn't stream GenG matches outright for the recent event?
[0:09:18] naocorrijo: this game has a huge pause
[0:09:24] Elysian_Shine: 4 games a day is so weird
[0:09:25] 치지지지직: because of*
[0:09:25] imainleesin: the overlay is soooo trash
[0:09:43] littleindianman12: The pause was longer than the game LOL
[0:09:46] imainleesin: wait untill the ingame overlay.
[0:09:50] Giiino: perfect production
[0:10:00] 치지지지직: MarkZ to blame

[0:11:05] littleindianman12: it was so dumb the pause was longer than the game and they delayed for no reason lololol
[0:11:14] littleindianman12: C9 were about to end the game
[0:11:20] Fire_elemen6: FBI is not Gumayusi
[0:11:41] heckintim: rocket scientist ^^
[0:11:47] Ephruz: AlienDance
[0:11:51] Elysian_Shine: Seems like riot na always has the worst UI's
[0:12:02] CrazyTheConfused: the doublelift commentary is like your avg twitch chat
[0:12:11] littleindianman12: I actually dont understand why lucian is so much worse in lec and lcs even when piloted by players like upset, hans, or berserker
[0:12:23] asphy0396: the DL yapping was so crazy this game @CrazyTheConfused
[0:12:32] asphy0396: did u hear the delusional shit he was saying
[0:12:36] asphy0396: while also making himself look bad
[0:12:37] asphy0396: :D
[0:13:35] Loxi9: what do u think about viego @MonteCristo i feel like this champ is so useless unless ur team is significantly better than enemy team
[0:13:50] asphy0396: viego is so awkward no? so hard to reach lucian or milio or tali, and not much utility from possesing ksante
[0:14:02] asphy0396: the only spot its useful is if jarvan ints and u take his soul and eq someone
[0:14:30] asphy0396: but i suppose its good because his comp doesnt NEED him to win fights, so the comp is complete without him
[0:14:37] KevinLeMinion: @MonteCristo youre not watching the packers and the 49ers?
[0:14:57] asphy0396: o shit yeah LOL
[0:15:12] 치지지지직: 5 if you include Rell?
[0:15:29] Loxi9: think he is afraid of picking brand into j4
[0:15:30] GelatoSquid: brand can kill the void grubs absurdly fast
[0:15:40] Giiino: TL carries got abused for a change today. that team has no chance with them imo
[0:15:41] GelatoSquid: he feels so strong
[0:15:52] Elysian_Shine: would be pretty magic damage heavy with ap jg

[0:17:03] Loxi9: i watched live, lcs was significantly quicker than lec for example
[0:17:08] Loxi9: until the dreaded pauses
[0:17:15] littleindianman12: watching the games live it was very eye opening how bad lec production has gotten over the years with the amount of delays
[0:17:16] Elysian_Shine: What do you think about the new overlays?
[0:17:23] imainleesin: its soo awful LUL
[0:17:30] Fire_elemen6: No grub counter
[0:17:32] rfarleydude97: yeah the top format there is ass
[0:17:36] imainleesin: whoever did this overlay should get fired
[0:17:36] addaberry: 8 - 8
[0:17:40] rfarleydude97: the old one literally didnt need to be change
[0:17:58] naocorrijo: ogn had goated production, leagues should just copy (and korea bring them back)
[0:17:59] Ephruz: The old overlay looked more like the game. This would look better in a competitive racing game or something lol
[0:18:02] Elysian_Shine: the 2020 lcs overlay was the worst of any i've seen
[0:18:27] mozomb: gonna crush too fast
[0:19:00] Loxi9: @Elysian_Shine that was when they swapped positions for gold and kills right?
[0:19:16] f3lchmaster9000: Is this the Mad Monte Banger's Stream
[0:19:27] Krepo: yo
[0:19:28] kAtz124: palafox is oom at lv3?
[0:19:32] Elysian_Shine: @Loxi9 I think so, and it was so black you couldn't read the text
[0:19:34] Krepo: you can skip SK vs TH
[0:19:45] CrazyTheConfused: LUL
[0:19:52] rfarleydude97: LMAO

[0:22:02] mozomb: udyr top=free grubs LUL
[0:22:18] CrazyTheConfused: Listening to Dom talk about udyr was hella funny. he was mad mad about some udyr today
[0:22:23] Loxi9: jojo is 2 waves up 1v1 laning
[0:22:35] TwiceTSTS: Bruiser ap Udyr is great but tank Udyr is just weak
[0:22:43] heckintim: @CrazyTheConfused prob dudu udyr last night vs kiin
[0:22:44] Fire_elemen6: Bwipo had one of the better Udyrs imo
[0:22:48] definitelynotkus: his game stall is amazing, he can be like singed and stall waves late if your team gets killed
[0:22:56] asphy0396: grubs are especially good in a tank build
[0:23:12] asphy0396: since ur lacking tower dmg, so it ends up being more of ur total dps to a tower
[0:23:38] diefo12: BLUBBER KEKHeim
[0:23:54] Krepo: enhance
[0:24:01] asphy0396: lcs overlay xdd the 0 also looks like 8
[0:24:03] Giiino: they have tobe at leas twice that big
[0:24:12] Loxi9: ye the new overlay is really bad
[0:24:14] SaltineCracker94: An overlay for ants
[0:24:15] Krepo: i cant eblieve LCS still doesnt have the gold diff overlay
[0:24:19] Krepo: @markz
[0:24:26] Loxi9: no one does besides lec
[0:24:26] heckintim: need magnifying glass for bangers only
[0:24:39] asphy0396: lmfao
[0:24:46] TwiceTSTS: The LCS overlay looks so cheap, made with tape
[0:24:47] Krepo: priceless
[0:25:03] heckintim: im convinced Phreak made the overlay
[0:25:03] hynterman: @Krepo <3
[0:25:08] Loxi9: whats lck
[0:25:11] Loxi9: what
[0:25:14] livid_poptart: what is this? an overlay for ants?
[0:25:23] asphy0396: yeah actually its odd that it isnt standard across all t1 leagues
[0:25:48] imainleesin: I find the players names hard to read also
[0:25:52] Savvasp96: LEC is still trying the said
[0:25:57] asphy0396: @imainleesin yeah the font just SUCKS

[0:26:05] Fire_elemen6: Look, the UI designers have never seen a grub
[0:26:06] Loxi9: its also bugged on champion information so we cant see it on the bottom left either
[0:26:09] UpYerArs: @MonteCristo can you vod review dig vs imt, i think it was one of the league games ever played
[0:26:10] Crushzilla: we really dont need the champ stuff in the bottom corners. its on the sides and on the gameplay, lots of room to be found at the bottom.
[0:26:24] Loxi9: look jojo's champ info doesnt show how many grubs he has
[0:26:28] Loxi9: so fkn cringe
[0:26:35] asphy0396: @Loxi9 thats actually the game itself
[0:26:36] littleindianman12: Can we sub goal dig vs imt
[0:26:40] definitelynotkus: the font is low resolution, why isnt the hud ultra high res?
[0:26:46] asphy0396: you cant click on a teammate and see grub count
[0:26:48] livid_poptart: hey Monte, any teams to look out for in LCK besides T1/Gen G?
[0:26:48] asphy0396: only shows for u
[0:26:51] mainanalyst: it wasnt very good, you didn't miss much
[0:26:53] Savvasp96: It was just as terrible as you think it was
[0:27:04] Loxi9: @asphy0396 ye but thats not by design is it?
[0:27:04] fartnugget45: NRG was really bad in this game. contractz was good though
[0:27:05] Fire_elemen6: That decision is probably good for your brain health
[0:27:07] SaltineCracker94: Mask went 0/7 on Azir you're not missing much
[0:27:08] Loxi9: thought it was a bug
[0:27:09] oliM____: a kill insofaOhNo
[0:27:10] TwiceTSTS: The DIG vs IMT game reminds of a boring version of the legendary DIG vs Renegades game
[0:27:22] UpYerArs: freeze pipe sponsored crappers only
[0:27:23] asphy0396: @Loxi9 yep its just bugged : D
[0:27:41] Loxi9: its also bright white so its a flashbang for anyone on darkmode
[0:27:42] heckintim: according to google translate
[0:27:56] mainanalyst: XiaoHu was being nice, because he wants to play freelo
[0:28:15] asphy0396: he saw nautilus be there, and then leave LOL!
[0:28:21] asphy0396: and still doesnt realize hes mid
[0:28:37] Savvasp96: Good thing half the screen is used for a tweet so we can't even see the play
[0:29:08] asphy0396: wait he just gets dry hooked
[0:29:11] asphy0396: DRY AS FUCK
[0:29:17] Crushzilla: and j4 wiffs LUL
[0:29:23] heckintim: genius
[0:29:44] imainleesin: 1-8
[0:29:58] CrazyTheConfused: the varus ult there hurt
[0:30:12] Krepo: bro ever since monte got that Grubhub sponsorship he sold out
[0:30:15] littleindianman12: berserker killed blaber there with the missed varus ult sadge
[0:30:31] littleindianman12: because I think they would have been a huge turn for c9
[0:30:34] Krepo: wish my gf talked about me the way he talks about grubs
[0:30:36] Loxi9: why didnt he flash over the wall?
[0:31:00] asphy0396: @Loxi9 thats worse
[0:31:13] asphy0396: jarvan can just ult him and he dies faster

[0:35:27] asphy0396: during the pause they literally just asked him bunch of random shit
[0:35:29] littleindianman12: but that was about it when you have DL on the mic lol
[0:35:30] Bloodtotem: and thats why i would rather watch co-streams
[0:35:44] asphy0396: there was pause at 24mins that lasted like30mins or smth iirc
[0:35:47] asphy0396: was so boring

[0:47:32] Moobot: @adamantinekata24 Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:47:55] imainleesin: oh we made it to the chrono situation?
[0:47:58] Krepo: Also sadly there is not much nice to say about SK's game
[0:48:01] n_e_i_l: can you self portrait cast taliyah wall
[0:48:12] eklyps_lol: sk game was tragic lol
[0:48:32] imainleesin: the TH vs SK game casting was the most boring shit ive ever experienced
[0:48:36] Loxi9: wasnt it just insane draft gap
[0:48:37] Yasukeh: been making good betting on TH. that first MAD loss made their odds go up immensely
[0:48:39] luxury_ball: were u impressed by this american lucian milio?
[0:48:40] kAtz124: Nisqy still plays sus hummmm
[0:48:42] Loxi9: seraphine runs ur region
[0:48:45] Exedra711: SK were victims of the draft kingdom combined with not playing the best
[0:48:52] addaberry: The only thing of note from the pause was that Chronobreak was at one point called the "Deterministic Disaster Recovery Tool" which is pretty cool
[0:48:56] Krepo: if we are good we win that draft
[0:49:00] Krepo: even tho the draft SUCKD
[0:49:10] Owlmaester: C9 gonna win Lcs again?
[0:49:10] UpYerArs: kc has to be completely mental boomed at this point
[0:49:14] eklyps_lol: gragas op ? xd
[0:49:22] imainleesin: @Krepo copium
[0:49:23] SirKavouris: krepo is in sk?
[0:49:39] Kiwislap: pause was longer than the game
[0:49:39] Loxi9: surely this taliyah wall will now save their game
[0:49:44] mikethetank: lol
[0:49:53] zanchu: why does it take that long to determine it lol
[0:49:54] mikethetank: this is when i turned off the stream originally
[0:49:57] Shanarru: small indy company
[0:50:05] eklyps_lol: surely this chronobreak gives nrg a shot right xd
[0:50:06] ryannnnnnn: I thought the NBA replay was bad
[0:50:17] eklyps_lol: ITS THE SAME FUCKING WALL ANGLE
[0:50:33] eklyps_lol: just a little better timed haha
[0:50:44] l1ght0heav3n: they paused for 30mins to get the best fight possible and still lost
[0:50:46] Tsuchimiya: why didn't he pause again, it didnt work
[0:50:50] zen__cloud: are you gonna watch the BRO vs FearX games?
[0:50:55] AllAero: they should of paused and just /ff
[0:51:09] Banterlife: anti banger
[0:51:13] Loxi9: look they synced waves, no team in lec could do this
[0:51:16] Loxi9: : )
[0:51:18] kAtz124: surely this game is a banger xdd
[0:51:26] Fire_elemen6: And then they mess up the wave sync
[0:51:30] zen__cloud: FearX played pretty solidly vs BRO

[0:51:36] ENV187: Fear was much better against BRO, I think DRX and BRO are probably bottom 2
[0:51:37] mikethetank: the bro fear x games were not bangedrs
[0:51:57] rilsolo: someone needs to take palafox's license for wall building away
[0:52:02] Phaetox: This is the mash to go with our bangers
[0:52:11] Cipherflare: I think we will get more bugs in LCS on live patch new rules @montecristo
[0:52:20] Exedra711: Agreed
[0:52:23] eklyps_lol: all ill say is TL still looks giga trash nrg is overrated and NA sucks haha
[0:52:32] StuntmanStan: zero kinda looks like an eight
[0:52:48] ENV187: also the fact that LCK is the only region with grub counters on their hud is really frustrating
[0:52:49] Tsuchimiya: the new overlay feels very much like change for the sake of change and I hate it
[0:53:03] 2baseblink: its almost as bad as the LCK champ select overlay
[0:53:04] rilsolo: they need to find dragon and baron sponsors and they might put the timers closer to the middle
[0:53:08] lazink: yeah the grub counter is nice on the LCK broadcast
[0:53:11] Krepo: i fucking hate this double sup shit
[0:53:13] Bloodtotem: Do you think having it on live will help or hurt NA overall?
[0:53:23] Krepo: riot would hotfix it but they already hotfixed
[0:53:24] Loxi9: on the dive mark said the reason why they didnt do bo3 was because live patch would be a "splashier change" :  )
[0:53:28] zen__cloud: double support item meta is pretty gross
[0:53:55] SirKavouris: 6 voidgrubs
[0:53:59] SirKavouris: cause of udyr
[0:54:23] heckintim: i think we need monte to just ms paint an NA overlay. Pog
[0:54:29] Elysian_Shine: Hes immortal vs that comp aswell
[0:54:32] heckintim: 10x improvement
[0:54:56] Loxi9: wouldnt better teams play to rotate their bot when grubs are worth contesting
[0:54:58] eklyps_lol: also realistically, who kills him in a comp like this ?
[0:55:08] Krepo: if u draft no late game carry into  udyr u lose
[0:55:14] Krepo: taliyah lucian kstane xdd
[0:55:37] kAtz124: palafox split the enemy team but his team was afk watching? WHAT?
[0:55:39] Tsuchimiya: Didn't Doublelift say everyone was paper in this meta
[0:55:40] zen__cloud: have to choose the darius/olaf/zac and just ignore udyr
[0:55:43] Krepo: usually udyr  builds armor --> azir fucks him
[0:55:45] Tsuchimiya: LUL
[0:55:46] dynamomarsh: can players stop with the lucian though. It just looks like scrim brait
[0:55:48] eklyps_lol: so im not dumb and people not drafting an answer loses them game 10 out of 10 times
[0:55:50] Krepo: or mr --> ad mid fucks him
[0:55:55] dynamomarsh: bait*
[0:55:57] lazink: in LCK they picked Darius into Udyr, would be interesting to see if that was a fluke or if it's a true counter
[0:55:57] thisisKakashi: seraphs is fine, probably need stormsurge or any other dmg item
[0:55:58] Yasukeh: void staff penetration to work off of 0 base damage
[0:56:10] eklyps_lol: vegan build taliyah
[0:56:16] iluld: taliyah isnt a main carry anyway, bad comp in total against anything tnaky
[0:56:26] asphy0396: @Tsuchimiya exactly, assume the opposite of what he says
[0:56:31] eklyps_lol: ms cdr

[0:56:39] Bloodtotem: @MonteCristo Do you think playing on live patch will help or hurt NA overall?
[0:56:43] iluld: champs does 0 damage to anything relatively tanky
[0:56:57] UpYerArs: @MonteCristo gonna go to the gym and watch the bangers only, gonna be a good workout
[0:57:19] kAtz124: annoy af but cant kill ppl Noted
[0:57:29] eklyps_lol: you need an aphelios or an azir or something lol
[0:57:40] Kango42: sundered -> shojin -> steraks is gross right now on so many champs
[0:57:41] eklyps_lol: @MonteCristo what do you answer udyr with in draft ?
[0:57:43] antagonist556: thats the weird armor item
[0:57:44] Manjiji: twitch notification an hour late :(
[0:57:45] Loxi9: didnt they go lucian milio taliyah first 3
[0:57:48] antagonist556: howling despair
[0:57:57] Loxi9: what did they ban? why did they even leave udyr up
[0:58:04] TheHaux: Bot lane for c9 didnt look the good this game
[0:58:05] SirKavouris: darius olaf
[0:58:11] GelatoSquid: Darius looked disgusting lmao
[0:58:14] Exedra711: A lot of items are decent on jarvan cleaver, shojin, sunderer
[0:58:16] asphy0396: karma is rly good into him, and really good champ overall rn with malignance into supp items
[0:58:25] Loxi9: darius olaf arent real counters if the udyr player is competent
[0:58:43] Kango42: the most obivous choice is rumble
[0:58:43] Exedra711: Udyr needs to be piloted well, especially early
[0:58:49] Krepo: udyr is lowkey meh tbh
[0:58:51] SirKavouris: adam picked it too
[0:58:58] Molonym: Darius looked nasty, but then again that's Kiin on Darius gapping a low/mid tier top laner
[0:59:00] Phaetox: Nasus SeemsGood
[0:59:02] Exedra711: A good udyr will win any lane
[0:59:07] Naxser: @MonteCristo Darious it's good counter :v
[0:59:12] eklyps_lol: i feel like the strongest answer ive seen is rumble and it felt like udyr had to missplay for him to win lane
[0:59:27] Naxser: @MonteCristo You need to watch gen.g vs ns
[0:59:34] fartnugget45: GenG match had Canyon+Kiin combining to dong on them. It seemed like player skill counter more than champ counters in both cases though
[0:59:36] UpYerArs: lmaooo why is DL dressed as a washed up wall street banker, did they not tell him the dress code
[0:59:39] Cipherflare: dom said udyr beat rumble
[0:59:45] imnotkreative11: that shia leobuf song is hilarious
[0:59:45] asphy0396: ^
[0:59:50] Krepo: we played 5 scrims where udyr took  top tower min 10
[0:59:52] Krepo: we lost 4
[0:59:54] thisisKakashi: i might be huffing some cope but i think lucian mid is really strong idk why anyone isnt playing it
[0:59:55] eklyps_lol: kiin mvp incoming
[0:59:56] mikethetank: the brand jg was fun in kr
[0:59:59] asphy0396: udyr claps rumble
[1:00:00] mikethetank: last night
[1:00:14] tt__q: why dont you watch the games live?
[1:00:22] Loxi9: @Krepo if he took top tower min 10 he doesnt have a job for the rest of the game?
[1:00:27] fartnugget45: Kiin played well but Canyon was the carry on GenG imo. Hes really fucking good
[1:00:33] Krepo: jobless udyr PepeHands
[1:00:34] Loxi9: why did he take turret so early and end laning phase?
[1:00:46] Zachary_Blobman: you think a cassio might come out vs udyr?
[1:00:54] mikethetank: i watch a ton of the sideproject youtube history videos
[1:01:06] AllAero: what was the book called, I think I missed it
[1:01:15] eklyps_lol: this geng roster is a treat and i sincerely hope they do well all year long lol
[1:01:18] rilsolo: no
[1:01:20] SirKavouris: they banned it
[1:01:21] Loxi9: spqr @AllAero
[1:01:22] Exedra711: @zachary_blobman feel like lvl 1 udyr just runs her over anyways
[1:01:22] fartnugget45: Nope, double tank and he was great still
[1:01:26] mikethetank: someone else played the brand
[1:01:27] AllAero: ty ty
[1:01:28] orion2467: Mary Beard SPQR - something like that
[1:01:33] eklyps_lol: Gen G golden road maybe ?

[1:01:58] mikethetank: oh willer played the braand and destrroyed
[1:02:11] AllAero: downloading on audible rn :)
[1:02:17] lazink: always nice when you find a good youtuber on a subject you like, the hard part is finding them and not getting click baited
[1:02:22] Banterlife: canyon is on maokai duty
[1:02:31] eklyps_lol: oh boy SR
[1:02:36] eklyps_lol: feelsbadman
[1:02:37] insanity: Let's go ahead and skip over the last 15 minutes of this game
[1:02:50] Loxi9: @insanity PepeHands
[1:02:54] asphy0396: lol
[1:02:59] StuntmanStan: you can find a lot of classic novels for free on audilble
[1:03:05] eklyps_lol: @insanity Based pick tho
[1:03:06] mikethetank: ive been listening to soo many history videos on youtube
[1:03:13] asphy0396: insanity draft always a fun one
[1:03:22] RomanticCreampie: do you like the movies?
[1:03:36] Cipherflare: how do we fix the cowboys?
[1:03:41] zen__cloud: @insanity does zac outheal/outpush udyr?
[1:03:48] asphy0396: udyr fists zac
[1:03:52] insanity: saw zac lvl 1 win vs udyr
[1:03:55] insanity: all in to the death
[1:03:57] lazink: Jerry Jones dies?
[1:03:57] insanity: blob rng tho
[1:04:06] thewfalt: Cowboys DNA = choke
[1:04:14] SaltineCracker94: Purdy looking like a choker right now
[1:04:18] ENV187: its a hover for his gf
[1:04:21] thisisKakashi: bwipo just hovering kaisa
[1:04:21] asphy0396: thats bwipo gf hover
[1:04:23] ENV187: its her fav champ
[1:04:23] hynterman: @insanity NA MID PogChamp
[1:04:31] TheWhiteWayneBrady: How many decades is it going to take the Bears to be competitive?
[1:04:36] lazink: why are the coaches on stage? they just walk back and forth not saying anything
[1:04:43] insanity: nah im here to listen to the flame
[1:04:44] SirKavouris: insanity nice game today
[1:04:51] insanity: not the positive things
[1:05:06] thisisKakashi: visa issues
[1:05:06] lazink: visa issues
[1:05:10] insanity: he got here late
[1:05:11] asphy0396: lcs classic
[1:05:23] SaltineCracker94: @thewhitewaynebrady as a bears fan we have the second most cursed QB history in the NFL
[1:05:30] AllAero: the flyquest comp runs NA
[1:05:31] Loxi9: @insanity i think bring ruby back after this game :)
[1:05:32] fartnugget45: Zac was good until poppy remembered his W is a hard counter to the all in
[1:05:40] insanity: already paid for his flight @Loxi9
[1:05:46] asphy0396: hahaha
[1:05:47] ENV187: its PAPA
[1:05:49] Loxi9: haha
[1:05:55] thisisKakashi: i dont get why picking the nami here, unless senna nami is a thing
[1:05:57] Zachary_Blobman: Senna rly good with the support item shenanigans
[1:05:59] Exedra711: Gg already
[1:06:03] thisisKakashi: cant you pick a strong other pick and save nami for 3?
[1:06:07] asphy0396: lucian nami in western region? free loss. senna seraphine in LCS? free win.
[1:06:07] xEmpyre: My Queen
[1:06:15] asphy0396: its just over in 2 picks unfortunately :(
[1:06:32] 2baseblink: ur about to learn bad things
[1:06:38] HASTERIOUS: Spica doesn't have a team :(
[1:06:38] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:06:39] MCO_9: senna is very broken rn
[1:06:43] Cipherflare: I don’t hear TSM chanting anymore PoroSad
[1:07:00] fartnugget45: Also isn't Nami just worse than Millio
[1:07:13] thisisKakashi: inspired likes trundle
[1:07:24] thisisKakashi: maybe can flex it too
[1:07:31] AllAero: trundle can 1v1 xin is the thought process I think
[1:07:31] thisisKakashi: but its 4 5 blue so not flex
[1:07:35] Molonym: LCK played Trundle I think?
[1:07:37] HASTERIOUS: @MonteCristo Have you reviewed MarkZ's changes to the LCS? What are your thoughts
[1:07:38] eklyps_lol: trundle is very strong atm tho lol
[1:07:54] asphy0396: @HASTERIOUS they arent his changes lol
[1:07:58] TheTraderKing: all these pros would be hardstuck bronze if they had my teammates Kappa
[1:08:10] Zachary_Blobman: ap botlanes good right now i think. better than trad adcs. ziggs seraphine karthus best rn
[1:08:13] mikethetank: does trundle stop the udyr effectively?
[1:08:22] eklyps_lol: it can imo
[1:08:25] AllAero: the poppy pick here is so fkin turbo, how does zac play the game
[1:08:30] eklyps_lol: only matchup ive struggled with lol
[1:08:33] asphy0396: poppy is so good yeah
[1:08:44] thisisKakashi: yeah this into senna sera sounds rough
[1:08:50] Kango42: trundle on previous patches needed a couple of items to be a really strong split threat. Now he just needs ravenous
[1:08:50] eklyps_lol: but again im not a pro player so my data is probably completely innacurate
[1:08:50] HASTERIOUS: negated by poppy W lol
[1:09:08] Zachary_Blobman: Zac into poppy is so sad to play
[1:09:13] Loxi9: is that the theory behind it, draft a lot of dive vs seraphine
[1:09:13] Fire_elemen6: Us there a reason to go Nami over the Milio there?
[1:09:20] UpYerArs: SR comp cant do anything when FLY just 5 mans and Poppy saves W
[1:09:21] HASTERIOUS: running into an AOE wombo combo because they're all melee
[1:09:27] Molonym: Ori, Sera, Poppy W, hard to play into
[1:09:41] fartnugget45: If shopify banned poppy over trundle I think they would have had a better shot. Zac played really well
[1:10:07] HASTERIOUS: if I'm SR you should be camping bot maybe?
[1:10:09] lazink: Turtle played well as well
[1:10:15] mikethetank: is trundle just for udyr basically?
[1:10:23] thisisKakashi: i guess the idea is that MR items are stronger now
[1:10:27] eklyps_lol: turtle insanity were trying so hard to win
[1:10:34] insanity: wont spoil anything but they buffed his sustain
[1:10:37] insanity: cant rly push him out of lane
[1:10:40] orion2467: "Emperor of Rome" is her her latest work
[1:10:44] fartnugget45: Turtle had a good game tbh
[1:10:49] eklyps_lol: absolutely
[1:10:51] AllAero: I remember an ancient dom video where insanity played zac mid with qtpie there as well. such a classic banger
[1:10:53] HASTERIOUS: What's SR's early game strategy? Camp bot to get lucian ahead and hope to hell that FLY doesn't hit their pwoer spikes?
[1:11:17] eklyps_lol: in my book i can see a world where sr is top 4 if everything falls into place
[1:11:24] luxury_ball: no azir :(
[1:11:28] thisisKakashi: i want to see hwei in lcs
[1:11:31] eklyps_lol: maybe im just hard fkn coping lol
[1:11:40] thisisKakashi: insanity hwei is sexy

[1:11:47] xEmpyre: what if your tanks build AD items?
[1:11:59] insanity: that would be quite the predicament @xEmpyre
[1:12:00] asphy0396: losing 2 wards there is so sad lol
[1:12:17] asphy0396: bwipo  the goat
[1:12:23] Molonym: LUL Bwipo
[1:12:26] eklyps_lol: THATS MY GOAT
[1:12:32] asphy0396: weird he doesn instantly ghost, i feel like he might actually kill him if he did
[1:12:47] thisisKakashi: i feel like bwipo is the only top laner i can think of that would do this
[1:12:50] asphy0396: also sicne the ghost is so long, he can actually use the back end of its duration to run back to lane
[1:12:51] xEmpyre: @insanity two MR items rush Aware
[1:12:57] asphy0396: and miss less minions potentially
[1:13:05] Banterlife: bit of an edger
[1:13:15] eklyps_lol: bwipo is always up everyone's buisness lol
[1:13:55] AllAero: bwipo is such a fun player to watch
[1:14:01] thisisKakashi: skip a bitr
[1:14:01] Giiino: experience lcs
[1:14:02] AllAero: LMAO THE PAUSE
[1:14:02] asphy0396: even if he doesnt kill him, he probably chunks him so low that xin has to recall instead of doing raptors
[1:14:03] HASTERIOUS: love LCS production
[1:14:03] Loxi9: short pause
[1:14:07] KTCAOP: At least this was a shorter pause IIRC
[1:14:09] heckintim: why did you pause insanity
[1:14:11] thisisKakashi: skip the pause
[1:14:14] insanity: server was having intermittent packet loss
[1:14:19] asphy0396: gg
[1:14:26] asphy0396: network issues also happened the game before lol
[1:14:48] thewfalt: Banger (pauses) only
[1:14:50] asphy0396: how tilting is it if ur the jg here
[1:15:06] asphy0396: this shit happens, then theres a pause, and then 30mins later you remember that this bullshit happened
[1:15:26] eklyps_lol: gigachad
[1:15:29] asphy0396: real
[1:15:36] TheHaux: Yea but riot thinks it god
[1:15:38] eklyps_lol: banger

[1:15:51] eklyps_lol: youre feeding into riot's god complex
[1:15:53] eklyps_lol: xd
[1:15:53] Deadlytaunt: you can't control the weather but you can control your shit game and network
[1:16:00] NecroticTouch: riot is god
[1:16:09] dynamomarsh: riot is god though? I'm confused
[1:16:11] Haziri_: And Riot feels challenged by God now and will proceed to make weather problems and lag problems
[1:16:33] asphy0396: yes they do
[1:16:35] SirKavouris: they did in the start
[1:16:37] Molonym: they did
[1:16:40] asphy0396: once theyre in game

[1:17:08] zen__cloud: monte, why do most teams have the support play senna instead of the adc?
[1:17:35] SirKavouris: yellow runes kinda useless no? insanity if u go conqueror
[1:17:52] luxury_ball: depends on the champs and team
[1:17:57] thisisKakashi: it also depends on preference, some ads like sera, some prefer the senna
[1:18:03] insanity: yea but it woulda got me a kill at some point
[1:18:19] SirKavouris: aftershock and primary green runes are fine i think
[1:18:28] eklyps_lol: i guess having tenacity last stand would be good here
[1:18:28] Loxi9: inspired is the goat or what
[1:18:30] asphy0396: inspired kinda the goat HAHAHA
[1:18:50] thisisKakashi: also i feel like aftershock falls off , could be wrong
[1:18:53] insanity: we saw him there, i thought he wouldn't have range to make it tbh
[1:18:54] thisisKakashi: compared to conq
[1:18:59] insanity: ye it does fall off
[1:19:10] h0urze: is that RTZ !? BatChest
[1:19:15] postoso: bwipo was the goat this game
[1:19:34] kekelsfloorpov: hi monte hon long time no see, who do you have winning worlds this year and why is it an NA LCS team
[1:19:47] eklyps_lol: i just wonder what u do with conq, like i said i see value in legend tenacity and last stand maybe but first tree not sure
[1:20:01] NecroticTouch: nocturne ulted
[1:20:29] Imaslapyou: Just got here. How bad is NA this year chat
[1:20:31] insanity: triumph is good @eklyps_lol
[1:20:36] zen__cloud: look at that stat monte
[1:20:40] thisisKakashi: bwipo is a singed main at heart
[1:20:46] Cipherflare: did you see G2 💩 tweet?
[1:20:59] smithpw: Monte alone is S tier. With a player is Kreygasm
[1:20:59] eklyps_lol: ah fair enough haha
[1:21:04] zen__cloud: bwipo not playing on a stage in 503 days is crazy
[1:21:27] thisisKakashi: its cuz summer split ends hella early
[1:21:31] Exedra711: Bwipo also got the cheater recall off wtf
[1:21:43] Loxi9: last stand has potential no? ur perma down hp in that lane, sustaining off dorans and 2nd wind @insanity
[1:21:46] eklyps_lol: hopefully we get an insanity hwei soon
[1:21:47] iluld: i was praying inspired to go back to eu
[1:21:49] insanity: ye its good @Loxi9
[1:21:50] gandalfthegrey___: inspired was in contract jail on eg tbf
[1:22:06] Zachary_Blobman: yeah bwipo couls have made some teams. had a chance to play with Bo and Perkz on vitality

[1:22:14] Driatin: Came in and was like holy crap SR up 8-1 already at 6 min in... hate the font
[1:22:14] Fire_elemen6: Bwipo should have massaged Core more
[1:22:28] Zachary_Blobman: then bwipo coulda played with Jankos and Nemesis on TH. gone to worlds for sure
[1:22:46] CrayzeeTFT: lowkey SR were better this game but senna seraphine seem a bit silly atm
[1:22:54] thisisKakashi: maybe they will switch it in summer
[1:22:57] h0urze: agreed
[1:23:00] thisisKakashi: to bo3
[1:23:01] asphy0396: give us AT LEAST bo2s man
[1:23:02] fx_fanslowika: with 8 teams you should 100% play bo3
[1:23:05] eklyps_lol: TRUEE
[1:23:15] h0urze: bo1 is ass especially if only 1 game per day per team
[1:23:16] asphy0396: zac champion a bit crazy
[1:23:16] dynamomarsh: or if it is, then it needs to be in a tight format like with what LEC does
[1:23:17] xEmpyre: really hope we get bo3 for summer but not keeping my hopes up
[1:23:24] insanity: same
[1:23:27] asphy0396: so unlucky
[1:23:31] Exedra711: Ahh the e went into tower range
[1:23:32] eklyps_lol: name one good reason not to go for bo3 with 8 teams instead
[1:23:32] RomanticCreampie: so close
[1:23:32] iluld: same
[1:23:33] SirKavouris: dom said u coulda lived here
[1:23:35] Exedra711: Unlucky
[1:23:39] insanity: ye i can live
[1:23:40] SirKavouris: but it was rly well played
[1:23:41] insanity: if i go forward
[1:23:41] asphy0396: wait last stand kills there haha
[1:23:42] Retsub1: Do you think lcs should do something like lec with a lower amounts of bo1 into more bo3/5s?
[1:23:46] asphy0396: and flash out yeah
[1:23:48] insanity: i backed off cause i thought my last r would kill
[1:23:49] insanity: ye
[1:23:49] CrayzeeTFT: if he knew he was gonna live with 1 ye lmao
[1:23:52] Loxi9: they didnt go bo3 for now because they want data on the changes they made already
[1:23:54] insanity: if i go forward and get auto into flash out
[1:24:04] Loxi9: or at least thats the reasoning mark gave
[1:24:11] thisisKakashi: walk in and auto and flash
[1:24:30] SirKavouris: yeah rly well played for the shit happening
[1:24:45] SirKavouris: SR FOR MSI
[1:24:51] looknonumbers: do you think lucian reaches 0% pick rate next week?
[1:24:53] NecroticTouch: i respect it
[1:24:54] thisisKakashi: oh bwipo walked from proxying to getting a plate
[1:25:04] fartnugget45: Little rat bwipo snaking a plate LUL
[1:25:07] Loxi9: i think lucian is like 0-7 across eu and na
[1:25:22] asphy0396: ori ult xd
[1:25:29] asphy0396: shouldnt she just play first strike in this lane?
[1:25:33] eklyps_lol: is it me or herald is kinda worthless these days in most cases
[1:25:35] insanity: visage 3rd armor item
[1:25:36] asphy0396: and just farm gold
[1:25:40] Camer0n000: is there any reason to watch any lcs games other than ones that include c9 as a casual
[1:25:50] asphy0396: my goat
[1:26:02] Exedra711: My goat
[1:26:08] Loxi9: @Camer0n000 shopify rebellion, insanity is such a fun player to watch
[1:26:17] Zachary_Blobman: honestly Zac might have strongest teamfight midgame in lol
[1:26:24] Exedra711: Xerath enjoyers shiruPatronize
[1:26:28] zen__cloud: feels good that we have at least 1 midlaner willing to pick other stuff than the same 3 meta picks
[1:26:43] thisisKakashi: wait they didnt need to opt into this 2v3
[1:26:46] asphy0396: why didnt busio flash
[1:26:49] zanchu: damn turtle
[1:26:49] SweeeetDee: yeah he played that really well
[1:27:08] Exedra711: Idk what massus doing
[1:27:08] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:27:11] Giiino: is it weird in my head i still think of turtle as this hype rookie replacing chaox
[1:27:13] Loxi9: turtle's been playing lucian since guma was in his father's ballsack put some respect on his name EZ
[1:27:18] asphy0396: was busio locked into ult animation when he got bubbled actually
[1:27:20] KevnPaik: actually clean
[1:27:22] Phaetox: Agreed big props for even picking it
[1:27:29] thisisKakashi: weird play from flyquest bot, wp from turtle
[1:27:40] eklyps_lol: turtle closed this one with style
[1:27:40] 2baseblink: looks like massu made the commitment to the play and busio just had to go with it
[1:27:41] asphy0396: wait no he just didnt flash the bubble for fun
[1:27:55] imainleesin: Busio was feeling himself
[1:27:59] Fire_elemen6: I think Busio expected the cleanse to be popped on the Seraphine E before the dance goes through
[1:28:59] Exedra711: Yeah just questionable all round
[1:29:14] eklyps_lol: u think sera ended up locked in place after casting r no ?
[1:29:19] Loxi9: i would leave the game if i was bugi ngl
[1:29:28] asphy0396: @eklyps_lol no she clicked around after it for a bit
[1:29:30] Zachary_Blobman: zac ulitmate timing was nice
[1:29:31] asphy0396: couldve flashed it
[1:29:34] thisisKakashi: kinda sad tbh
[1:29:38] Giiino: impact gotta be getting close right?
[1:29:38] meeechow: Turtle gets so much hate for being "bad" over the years but like mans still got hands and a brain idk
[1:29:38] eklyps_lol: i stand corrected
[1:29:41] CrazyTheConfused: Turtle is like the perma mid ADC in LCS
[1:29:42] thisisKakashi: everyone else gone
[1:29:51] asphy0396: i thought the same too but i watched for that on replay
[1:29:56] thewfalt: DL on caster desk, WT still playing is wild
[1:29:58] SirKavouris: no scaling for sr tho in this game
[1:30:07] SirKavouris: is a mage better this game?
[1:30:10] SirKavouris: for insanity
[1:30:21] lazink: Turtle has always been good, he just makes risky plays that don't wok out sometimes
[1:30:25] Exedra711: But sadly its senna seraphine, you have to pummel em early
[1:30:30] asphy0396: turtle is a good litmus test for ADC players in the lcs
[1:30:52] IrishProphet: Chase Daniel of the LCS
[1:30:57] lazink: and he's just a nice guy :P
[1:31:01] KevnPaik: caster curse
[1:31:05] zanchu: and then he just ints there lmao
[1:31:09] Loxi9: tbf adc is the role that changes the least, still very impressive though
[1:31:16] thisisKakashi: i guess ppl underrate him bc his ceiling hasnt shown to be high in awhile
[1:31:22] luxury_ball: But TL Yeon knows all of Steves secrets
[1:31:34] thisisKakashi: like hes nowhere near berserker
[1:31:40] Fire_elemen6: He probably costs more than some of the ADC's in the league
[1:31:57] asphy0396: poppy is going titanic i believe
[1:32:01] asphy0396: or sundered sky
[1:32:19] Fire_elemen6: Bwipo has the phage

[1:32:53] hibbjibb: Did Senna + Seraphine lose at all today?
[1:33:27] eklyps_lol: dont think so
[1:33:30] Civiss: unfortunately, i dont think so
[1:33:32] thewfalt: mid diff at 14 rather than 15 sounds so cherrypicked lol
[1:33:44] Loxi9: 14 is for plates @thewfalt
[1:33:46] leamfor: @thewfalt It's when plates fall
[1:33:54] eklyps_lol: senna sera aka CEO of NA hasnt lost xd
[1:34:02] 2baseblink: Busio said they came up with the poppy build during champ select/pause
[1:34:09] xEmpyre: they were talking about between draft and going on stage if they needed more dmg spread
[1:34:41] leamfor: OMEGALUL
[1:34:44] thisisKakashi: i feel like bwipo and inspired are two of the smartest league brains in NA
[1:34:44] Civiss: LUL
[1:34:45] xEmpyre: i just watch kids play league man
[1:34:47] HASTERIOUS: yeah, why does lebron need a coach @MonteCristo
[1:34:58] KTCAOP: Empire best babysitter NA?
[1:35:02] asphy0396: @xEmpyre can you get your senna player to try bork please, he will be addicted after trying it once
[1:35:16] Giiino: adam gase got 10 years of jobs based on being buds with manning
[1:35:25] Zachary_Blobman: Will players ask their teammates opinions on build in game. or that seen as unprofessional?
[1:35:26] thewfalt: did brady need belicheck
[1:35:34] xEmpyre: @asphy0396 lethality too broken rn, maybe when they nerf it
[1:35:43] ladderoat: i miss watching peyton manning, was very unique to watch
[1:35:44] xEmpyre: i liked bork build last season
[1:35:52] asphy0396: oh yeah i made mistake 1. : assume the game is balanced
[1:35:52] leamfor: COPIUM
[1:35:58] asphy0396: but yeah agree with that
[1:36:15] MissingMatter: Look, the 8 thing is a known issue.
[1:36:18] HASTERIOUS: Yeah what the fuck is that? lmao
[1:36:24] thisisKakashi: they need to change that font
[1:36:27] asphy0396: yes, i kept seeing 8-10 killscore and thinking it was 8-18 in another game
[1:36:27] thisisKakashi: especially for the 8 and 0
[1:36:29] asphy0396: its so bad
[1:36:30] dah777: WHY do they use that kind of 0 LUL
[1:36:34] Driatin: I said that earlier lol
[1:36:39] zen__cloud: when they had 100T on earlier it looked like 188 too
[1:36:39] asphy0396: like the 0 towers looks like 8
[1:36:41] asphy0396: ffs
[1:36:43] Loxi9: watch this fight insanity smurfs i think
[1:36:49] CactusTea: true

[1:45:28] mainanalyst: We love our Papa <3
[1:45:43] DavidboY133: senna and seraphine scale way too hard this game
[1:45:51] mikethetank: this reminds me of this idea, from hs, we were allowed to make a cheat sheet, but couldnt use text, so the ideas of putting stuff into pictures worked
[1:45:56] ItzEnoz: they cronobreak a game thats like 99% over as well later
[1:45:58] meeechow: True we learned that Ezreal auto will pop his w the other day on champs
[1:45:58] ENV187: I do enjoy acquiring knowledge
[1:46:15] thisisKakashi: @ItzEnoz if ur talking about c9 that was earlier

[1:46:29] Exedra711: Smart by bwipo honestly
[1:46:47] Fire_elemen6: Bwipo also has a weird skilling buil
[1:46:50] thisisKakashi: i feel like building some damage on udyr is better than full tank
[1:47:07] ItzEnoz: Tank Udry is like giga tank though
[1:47:08] thisisKakashi: cuz full tank doesnt scale as hard with gold
[1:47:12] ItzEnoz: depends on your comp
[1:47:13] Exedra711: Hope massu grows into the role
[1:47:14] 2baseblink: Busio needs time to overcome the DL corruption
[1:47:28] mainanalyst: true
[1:47:35] buskaboo: Riot needs more money I guess
[1:47:36] Loxi9: still dont know why they took away proview
[1:47:37] GiLLzzzzy: isnt there only one rookie in this game - massu?
[1:47:41] TehOncomingStorm97: rip owl player

[1:48:30] swagatini: Just happened for Smite
[1:48:30] thisisKakashi: he said visage and then 3rd is armor

[1:49:07] SaltineCracker94: A more accurate nautilus hook
[1:49:08] KTCAOP: League of Legends 2 the dream?
[1:49:12] thisisKakashi: yeah new ppl would try it for sure
[1:49:13] Zionyx25: they could market it as league of legends 2
[1:49:23] Loxi9: @ItzEnoz they aced the staff so its looking a bit shaky
[1:49:26] thisisKakashi: or ppl who quit may retry it
[1:49:30] crawcook: also you want your game to keep up with new machines, who knows what can happen in the future.
[1:49:33] dagascar321: new engine is gonna introduce half a decade worth of bugs
[1:49:33] RomanticCreampie: ngl i'd be really surprised if a new engine brought in lots of new players
[1:49:42] PandaATV: LoL 2 won't happen unless all their other new ventures into other genres fail
[1:49:53] lazink: doubt they would called it League of Legends 2, maybe Enhanced or something, if all they were doing is changing the engine
[1:49:57] mainanalyst: rush of blood
[1:49:59] buskaboo: This is the same company that thinks not showing damage numbers of items is “better” for the game. No faith in Riot honestly
[1:50:14] crawcook: I don't know, other mobas are doing it, lol might also do it sooner or later
[1:50:16] Gunloth: League of Le engine?

[1:51:31] Meduhpg: oh please, dont get overly complex on criticism, it takes away from your valid points
[1:51:31] thisisKakashi: how much impact do you think a break can have on a pro? cuz bwipo hasnt played pro in forever but still looks like hes playing well

[2:03:36] SirKavouris: yeah u want a bit overlap
[2:03:40] Zen6: what if i just wanna be extra sure he is cc'd
[2:03:44] PapaSmithy: we were very fortunate that both bwipo and inspired rejected a lot of eu offers because they wanted to stay na
[2:03:46] SirKavouris: if u try to chain it perfectly it may miss
[2:03:48] najafan: What if the time dimension is the height?
[2:03:51] Slippery3: the game turns layering into chaining sometimes tho... i wonder what the rules are
[2:03:55] thisisKakashi: its crazy to me how EG went from no.1 NA team to such disgrace
[2:03:57] Exedra711: Well in the context of cc taking time to come into effect
[2:04:01] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo do you like the triforce on udyr? it seems to give him some extra threat potential
[2:04:04] gandalfthegrey___: do you think bo will be benched/
[2:04:20] PapaSmithy: (we didnt offer as much as eu either)
[2:04:28] bjdll: Kind of strange bwipo and inspired want to stay?

[2:04:48] asphy0396: was it for personal reasons or 'competitive' reasons? or do u not want to say / cant say @PapaSmithy
[2:04:53] najafan: Capitalism!
[2:04:57] PapaSmithy: @asphy0396 think both!
[2:05:03] Zachary_Blobman: Crazy that bwipo was not in LCS last year. seemed like he was willing to play on like any team
[2:05:08] ENV187: @PapaSmithy veterinarians* for clarification lol
[2:05:13] ASquishyLiquid: Why is it that ur allowed to stream this now but not live?
[2:05:21] asphy0396: makes sense, definitely understandable
[2:05:26] thisisKakashi: but they still got a winning position despite the early start @MonteCristo ?
[2:05:44] MissingMatter: Also you can't skip the pauses live.
[2:05:46] Loxi9: because its not a direct market substitute to the main stream @ASquishyLiquid
[2:05:49] Kharadus: also don't get to see draft adaptation in BO1s which is usually quite a bit of fun
[2:05:50] MissingMatter: And various other nonsense.
[2:05:51] Kiwislap: also you dont get to watch the 30 min pauses lol

[2:20:42] PapaSmithy: left side team cannot lose
[2:20:57] archie7497: @exedra711 his first 3 wave push was really good. He fucked up later in lane trading into rumble when he had no heat + using the wrong awakened ability a couple of times

[2:22:30] DixMX: why did teams suddenly start drafting Seraphine Senna bot lane? especially after LS has been talking about it for years
[2:22:31] archie7497: @exedra711 he crashed 3rd wave, based and bought null. He got the first 3 wave correct
[2:22:32] Dabrens12: The only way Red team wins there is by applying early pressure on enemy bot, and with their mid-jungle it's not possible

[2:27:36] mainanalyst: cocky
[2:27:47] zen__cloud: he used his Q for no reason too instead of saving for his W
[2:27:49] RawssDeBawss: disrespected Yasin and got put in the bin

[2:28:21] RawssDeBawss: my friends tell me I must play League with my screen off D:
[2:28:27] archie7497: @fx_fanslowika the good mids in general. Caps and humanoid are also insanely greedy with summs
[2:28:28] blizzardpolice69: thoorin and monte taught me
[2:28:31] Dabrens12: At least he didnt flash after 90% of players would xd

[2:29:50] ProdigalChicken: LUL
[2:29:54] blizzardpolice69: bro tryna be farmed
[2:29:55] fljqpy: yea why would u respect that
[2:29:56] RawssDeBawss: Fat man abuses old man in a jungle.
[2:29:58] blizzardpolice69: no wards even
[2:30:00] zen__cloud: can't wait for you to watch the G2 game and be disappointed
[2:30:04] DixMX: he got bored in lane lmao

[2:30:29] Exedra711: @rawssdebawss call an ambulance, but not for me
[2:30:32] zen__cloud: western league is so low quality so far
[2:30:41] RawssDeBawss: @Exedra711 I love that meme haha :D
[2:30:45] Goatsguffle: the ole thumbs up for outplay but used his flash lol
[2:30:50] ADrugge: Grandpa memory. He forgot he had a ward.
[2:30:50] RawssDeBawss: Nisqy used flash to make the lane fair.
[2:30:51] fljqpy: winter split doesnt matter
[2:30:52] DixMX: @zen__cloud you haven't watched CBLoL? Kappa
[2:31:00] SirKavouris: its fking week 1
[2:31:02] zlrenyth: @montecristo hey monte do u by any chance know how many viewers LCS peaked day 1 ?
[2:31:07] asphy0396: it’s literally week 1 of new patch man
[2:31:09] Birbmang_: bro they had like 1 week on the new patch
[2:31:12] Birbmang_: ofc it's dogshit
[2:31:13] Exedra711: Agreed
[2:31:19] Evan_Ralston: Saving the ward for the way out
[2:31:27] archie7497: @exedra711 right here wunder should have used awakened e not r
[2:31:30] DixMX: people are still discovering new strats for this new season
[2:31:30] RawssDeBawss: yeah, apparently I get shouted to build Sundering Sky when I'm trying to play full Lethality Garen, it's horrible
[2:31:33] Loxi9: lec didnt know what patch they were playing on until opening day i hear
[2:31:35] Loxi9: its been a mess
[2:31:37] moylend: @MonteCristo I love you Monte
[2:31:51] DixMX: imagine we had known this double supp item since december
[2:31:57] DixMX: teams would have been more prepared
[2:31:58] MissingMatter: Although some of these plays don't get excused by unfamiliarity with the patch
[2:31:58] blizzardpolice69: it's over
[2:32:02] KTCAOP: #bangersonly
[2:32:02] blizzardpolice69: if they just camp top

[2:32:08] thelasts1lence: What is your opinion on Lucian? I feel like he is so misused + I hate the Stormrazor RFC build
[2:32:11] zen__cloud: these things aren't because of patches
[2:32:15] Victarion_n: Wait until you see the G2 game LUL
[2:32:19] RawssDeBawss: @MonteCristo you are watching 10 drunk europeans cosplaying a LEC game.
[2:32:22] asphy0396: bro is thinking about the burgers he will buy with the plate gold
[2:32:23] archie7497: @exedra711 sorry w. I meant w
[2:32:24] blizzardpolice69: free
[2:32:25] blizzardpolice69: farm
[2:32:27] blizzardpolice69: the feeder
[2:32:29] direpants2: faster back
[2:32:38] Diphallus: these are the best games of the day too, the others are even worse
[2:33:03] RawssDeBawss: I woke up with a hangover today, worst 20 minutes of my week D:
[2:33:22] fx_fanslowika: no reason to fight sk wont get 5 prob
[2:33:26] fljqpy: u dont need to contest that anymore
[2:33:32] Fire_elemen6: When Perkz activates his Geass you're compelled to feed
[2:33:34] fljqpy: its dogshit
[2:33:53] Darkallyht: all these udyr are so bad
[2:33:58] archie7497: 4 grubs feel so useless. No need to risk a fight and lose
[2:34:02] Darkallyht: only zeus  is actually really good'
[2:34:13] preev0luti0n: im late for bangers
[2:34:14] RawssDeBawss: Irrelevant using the best rumble skin, gets +15% honor and damage
[2:34:17] biggerbeefey: Is LCS the only region going to live patch for pro play?
[2:34:25] naocorrijo: kt perfect looked good on udyr
[2:34:25] DixMX: @biggerbeefey yes
[2:34:27] Exedra711: @darkallyht his build was terrible though
[2:34:34] fljqpy: zoos udyr LUL
[2:34:40] fljqpy: no thanks
[2:34:57] Exedra711: They all need to watch some dom vods
[2:35:03] RawssDeBawss: Monte, how is the LCK looking, I've not got around to watch yet D:
[2:35:12] RawssDeBawss: I mean :D
[2:35:17] thelasts1lence: Oh hell nah Monte don't e-word KT or anything related to them please
[2:35:17] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:35:31] blizzardpolice69: w that
[2:35:38] naocorrijo: i've been watching perfect for a while, he got rank 1 when he was 16 or smth, he's an insane splitpusher and i can't wait to watch him on smth like jax with the grubs
[2:35:39] blizzardpolice69: !VODS
[2:35:39] DixMX: @thelasts1lence this KT has nothing to get excited for
[2:35:46] blizzardpolice69: !vods
[2:35:47] RawssDeBawss: I will watch that a bit later when I need something to watch when eating, cause that is gonna be BANGER content
[2:35:52] KMTlol: POGGERS
[2:36:11] archie7497: Wunder outside of lane was also really good. Held his awakened and user it when necessary
[2:36:18] fljqpy: DK vs KT soon
[2:36:24] thelasts1lence: @dixmx  This is what I want people to think thanks
[2:36:38] geo2044: KDF OMEGALUL
[2:36:38] NutellaHappens: BRO bad again Sadge
[2:36:43] usedxsoul: what were your thoughts about SKT finally winning worlds again last year and making LPL their prey like always.
[2:36:44] fljqpy: aiming > deft
[2:36:44] m_esse: did you already watch the C9 game
[2:36:58] moylend: @usedxsoul like always? kinda stretching it
[2:36:59] fljqpy: nice loaded question LUL why even ask
[2:37:01] NutellaHappens: just one year the BROlievers need to be rewarded
[2:37:04] RawssDeBawss: I can only imagine the carnage that would be a Dom, Thorin and Monte Bangers Only stream.
[2:37:07] itrBryan: Worlds felt anticlimactic imo
[2:37:10] Darkallyht: Caboshard is the worse player in LEC
[2:37:13] m_esse: brief thoughts since I missed it
[2:37:19] archie7497: Although kaiser played well. He didn't do well with the soul generation
[2:37:26] mikethetank: beem enjoying watching the first lck series, with the 1am start time in na
[2:37:31] fljqpy: thats a BIG bowl u got there
[2:37:34] d_kowalski: d_kowalski subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! BeryL about to slowly pull out the razors from KTs cake
[2:37:42] naocorrijo: drx is 0/2 but i feel like if they had a coach like cvmax they'd be good, their rookies are great they just have no macro
[2:37:43] fx_fanslowika: @archie7497 he had to sit next to seraphine for the item to work, cant play properly for souls
[2:37:45] RawssDeBawss: also, Monte eating food the way I try to drink cereal xD
[2:37:58] usedxsoul: @moylend Eh? elaborate?
[2:38:15] m_esse: any brief thoughts on C9 since I missed your review.
[2:38:21] PapaSmithy: could we please show some more respect to beryl, 2 time worlds winner 3 times qualified in a row goat support of all time?
[2:38:29] fernysilva19: so when do we get excited
[2:38:29] DixMX: BeryL keeps eating the cake, leaving only the razors
[2:38:33] archie7497: @fx_fanslowika that is true. I didn't think about it
[2:38:35] fljqpy: hes trying to reverse engineer a KT championship
[2:38:36] RawssDeBawss: Beryl gonna win worlds and become a 3x world champ ;)
[2:38:42] itrBryan: so they are fruitcake Kappa
[2:39:02] fljqpy: but what if beryl can only win a 3rd worlds with a completely different roster
[2:39:02] fx_fanslowika: btw kaiser had 3 good games in a row thats insanely nice to see
[2:39:18] Kharadus: so are you saying KT is still the premium choice for masochistic fans, just the flavor has changed, @MonteCristo ?
[2:39:31] fljqpy: they have to swap out pyosik and deft
[2:39:36] PapaSmithy: was not able to bait monte with my beryl compliments
[2:39:36] RawssDeBawss: KT winning worlds this year meanwhile Score on the sidelines "Am I a joke to you?" XD
[2:40:00] RawssDeBawss: @PapaSmithy I half-tried but he's just immune.
[2:40:09] biggerbeefey: Everytime KT plays I get out my ol 2014 KT rolster hoodie but it just isn't the same anymore
[2:40:13] aBitTooHircine: arrow winning when bullet never did BibleThump
[2:40:22] Bladetykon: I am again late since I did not know this was happeneing but I see udyr and I am intruiged

[2:40:25] RawssDeBawss: Monte got that Final Fantasy Ribbon on, immune to status
[2:40:46] RawssDeBawss: @aBitTooHircine yeah, Kakao won OGN before Score, brutal D:
[2:40:47] HerrArbiter: nisqy doesnt even use cask and he had so many chances
[2:40:59] grandezelx: monte what was so bad about that kt arrows winning they have rookie and that is probably the only title that he won by himself cause the other two chips were from the shy hard carrying
[2:41:09] fx_fanslowika: think its mostly because of flakked proficiency on seraphine
[2:41:19] naocorrijo: no, rookie carried 2018
[2:41:23] HerrArbiter: he couldve used it on perkz initiate i think
[2:41:32] fljqpy: doubt that gragas combo would do anything
[2:41:43] fljqpy: its too late
[2:41:43] archie7497: It's cuz flakked is a really good seraphine.
[2:41:55] fljqpy: no its bcos seraphine is a good champ
[2:41:57] usedxsoul: Oh its G2.0 vs SK
[2:42:08] DixMX: who would've thought the team would look better with Flakked playing Seraphine? Kappa
[2:42:13] CsicsiXD: Gamers3
[2:42:17] fljqpy: look at what the seraphine dide
[2:42:19] fljqpy: NOTHING
[2:42:40] Birbmang_: yamato's reactions in the kc game were fucking hillarious
[2:42:42] archie7497: It was more of a peel aphelios rumble ult no?
[2:42:50] Birbmang_: the face of pure terror
[2:43:06] fljqpy: perkz is the real ADC of this team
[2:43:28] naocorrijo: @Birbmang_ bo 25 deaths in 4 games, i'd be terrorized too
[2:43:32] RawssDeBawss: I got to talk a bit more with Riv, he wanted more Deus Ex Streams from me xD
[2:43:33] Bladetykon: @MonteCristo can you explain the double support item thing?
[2:43:48] DixMX: do western players look at teammates' monitors when Nocturne ults?
[2:44:10] SirKavouris: yeah because the shared minions doesnt count for penalty
[2:44:14] Birbmang_: @Birbmang_ saken targamas and cabochard are way more egregious, they just do nothing all game and want to lose slowly
[2:44:37] fljqpy: delete support items
[2:44:38] Birbmang_: upset perma elo hell
[2:44:40] naocorrijo: @Birbmang_ i agree, they're not good enough for lec but bo is terrible, he did the same last year on vit
[2:45:03] Diphallus: doss what are you doing
[2:45:17] Loxi9: bo is playing with 2 losing solo lanes while trying to be active, of course hes going to die
[2:45:32] 1xhealth: hey monte maxgreHi
[2:45:32] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:45:42] fljqpy: nesquik didnt go borianna its over
[2:45:44] Loxi9: his support also has no synergy wiht him or his ad, its doomed roster construction
[2:45:55] PapaSmithy: senna seraphine 📈
[2:45:57] Slippery3: is seraphine fun?
[2:46:06] fljqpy: define fun
[2:46:06] Loxi9: no idea who thought it was smart to put targamas and upset together, literally polar opposite players
[2:46:10] Bladetykon: can only senna go double support or are there other adcs that could go lower eco?
[2:46:14] PapaSmithy: worst is eu has this for one more week
[2:46:17] PapaSmithy: we are rid of it next week
[2:46:26] SirKavouris: rid of it?
[2:46:30] fljqpy: LCS superiority
[2:46:32] UltimateNPC: WAYTOODANK senna sera
[2:46:37] SirKavouris: i think this is broken without douple support item
[2:46:37] fljqpy: NA leads the way
[2:46:42] fx_fanslowika: @SirKavouris lcs plays live patch, it was removed
[2:46:42] MissingMatter: @SirKavouris LCS is on live patch this season
[2:46:43] naocorrijo: @Loxi9 for sure terribly constructed roster, but bo is a soloq players whos only ever looked good with doinb controlling his mind, he's dogshit
[2:46:50] Soxfan0138: do you think they will change the items or let the game evolve to double support?
[2:46:50] SirKavouris: i know
[2:46:51] Birbmang_: seraphine the ceo in the west
[2:46:57] SirKavouris: but it should be played
[2:47:08] SirKavouris: serapgine is broken with senna without double item
[2:47:08] imainleesin: LUL
[2:47:18] 1xhealth: @soxfan0138 theyre nerfing it next patch bro riot always nerfs stuff like that
[2:47:19] Birbmang_: i love perkz's ints this gam
[2:47:19] Diphallus: aphelios no flash
[2:47:21] feromortum: o7
[2:47:26] Diphallus: it's fine guys
[2:47:27] Makkle4000: Perkz classic
[2:47:34] PapaSmithy: to be fair it was a big package
[2:47:36] Diphallus: he prob said
[2:47:37] fx_fanslowika: aphelios no flash
[2:47:38] fx_fanslowika: worth
[2:47:38] Loxi9: @naocorrijo thats just not fair to say, a lot of junglers start out with good hands and poor map play. Bo's growth just got heavily hindered from the matchfixing scandal and bad rosters made around him
[2:47:43] fljqpy: hes got a rocket in his pocket
[2:47:46] RawssDeBawss: my package the same size of my brain
[2:47:46] ProdigalChicken: classic
[2:47:52] Bladetykon: I thought the dark urge was in Baldurs Gate not in league
[2:47:53] Birbmang_: all the blood went to his package
[2:47:55] RawssDeBawss: smol and having 2 cells fighting for 3rd place
[2:48:06] Exedra711: Post package clarity
[2:48:20] Birbmang_: jankos casually putting on another masterclass this game tbh
[2:48:25] TheTraderKing: guys how can you get above 10% winrate in league of legends?
[2:48:26] imainleesin: Perkz does the most delusional stuff sometimes
[2:48:36] fx_fanslowika: the rest of the team sweating trying their hardest to win
[2:48:38] DixMX: @TheTraderKing ask Yamato
[2:48:42] airbrid: He didn't need to do anything tbf Jankos won it for them
[2:48:43] Loxi9: look at how g2 played with yike early, they spoonfed everything to him until he developed enough on his own. Bo never got that luxury, he's thrown into the deep end @naocorrijo
[2:48:47] 1xhealth: hurts to see my goat like this
[2:48:47] feromortum: ResidentSleeper
[2:49:03] RawssDeBawss: TH vs SK trying to do some Jin Air cosplaying
[2:49:12] RawssDeBawss: 90 minute games or they don't play
[2:49:27] MissingMatter: Oh, Corki's practicing the too-deep dives for when he's got 4 infernal drake soul, is that it?
[2:49:36] imainleesin: Kaiser doing same dmg as adc Aware
[2:49:36] RawssDeBawss: I do miss the Jin Air Gladplane though :(
[2:49:50] thenexusobelisk: udyr top PogChamp
[2:49:55] RawssDeBawss: A terrible casuality of Jin Air not being around in league anymore.
[2:49:58] archie7497: The malignance build is bait imo. It's mainly eclipse on corki that's broken
[2:50:00] naocorrijo: @Loxi9 i mean 113 got thrown into the worst lec team after 6 months of pro play, he wasnt ready at all and still didn't int as hard as bo has done for the past 1 year and a split lol (although bo did fist him that one game)
[2:50:08] imainleesin: Flakked is a good seraphine tho
[2:50:15] Goatsguffle: Riot can't see that this kind of stuff is going to happen? or this is what they want?
[2:50:18] 1xhealth: league of shields
[2:50:28] d_kowalski: For pure entertainment value, the one match you should watch is DIG vs IMT
[2:50:31] RawssDeBawss: Flakked to Seraphine is Doublelift to Sona
[2:50:31] SirKavouris: this bot duo could be played with seraphine with no support item so...
[2:50:32] 1xhealth: this season is doomed

[2:50:48] RawssDeBawss: might as well use some caustic liquid for eye drops.
[2:50:56] imainleesin: @d_kowalski that game was just pathetic lmao
[2:51:05] PapaSmithy: i love the contempt drakos has for his time being hostaged by this game
[2:51:07] fljqpy: RUUUN
[2:51:08] thenexusobelisk: i like this season
[2:51:26] imainleesin: true, Drakos is soo checked out LUL
[2:51:30] d_kowalski: @imainleesin it went back and forth on the worst possible level, it was exactly why I love LCS
[2:51:36] Loxi9: @naocorrijo astralis was a team of psychos and kobbe, if he ran in lider and jeonghoon were behind him as well, bo's playing with kaiser in his worst form and perkz having a midlife crisis in mid
[2:51:36] Birbmang_: this game man
[2:51:37] DixMX: XD
[2:51:47] Goatsguffle: top tier league of legends here
[2:51:48] Birbmang_: what a clown show
[2:51:51] imainleesin: @d_kowalski it was definetly entertaining tho
[2:51:52] MissingMatter: He had another plant. He should've kept going.
[2:51:58] PapaSmithy: thats because any combination of buttons being pressed by the enemy
[2:52:03] PapaSmithy: leads to the same result.
[2:52:12] Loxi9: truth is if we want to see bo do well he needs to be on a team with  nisqy
[2:52:12] meeechow: EU layover is so much cleaner than NA's wtf
[2:52:15] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 and suddenly kaiser is having a good split with other jungler WOW amazing i wonder why
[2:52:40] fljqpy: 4 games into a new season and some rando support is "good" LUL
[2:52:49] Loxi9: @fx_fanslowika might legit be because hes back with the coach that raised him since his rookie split?
[2:52:59] fljqpy: just delete support items, they dont need it
[2:53:02] geo2044: We don't want a repeat of the ardent meta
[2:53:13] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 he had good splits without peter dun, playing with elyoya nisqy
[2:53:18] PaddiV: so.. you can grief your support by buying it first?^^
[2:53:24] 1xhealth: how do u even play the game
[2:53:34] Loxi9: yeah, and its really disingenuous to say hes better solely because of jankos and not peter
[2:53:37] baconmage1: Honestly suprised it wasn't hotfixed.  Now its even in solo queue it seems ever other game
[2:53:37] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 bo is just playing bad accept it he will  not be kicked anyway a she has high upside
[2:53:41] MissingMatter: @PaddiV Oh, probably. That sounds about right.
[2:53:58] geo2044: @PaddiV doesn't it work like how you can only by jungle items for junglers back then?
[2:54:00] najafan: I'll accept removing double support items if they bring back S5 jungle items.
[2:54:03] Birbmang_: he's done with this
[2:54:08] najafan: And lane swaps.
[2:54:09] archie7497: No cleanse aphe btw
[2:54:10] Loxi9: @fx_fanslowika never said he was playing well, just said it wasnt fair to calll him shit when hes never set up for success
[2:54:12] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 considering jankos track record of working well with his support and being amazing at comms its absolutelty something we can credit him with?
[2:54:13] najafan: Bring back lane swaps.
[2:54:21] fljqpy: delete jungle items too they dont need it
[2:54:44] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 many other junglers arent set up for succes and yet look good at bad teams:)
[2:54:45] Birbmang_: jungle items and support items are just dumb and shouldn't exit
[2:54:47] Birbmang_: exist*
[2:54:47] PaddiV: @mashiro106 could be.. but then you cant play senna acd/support
[2:54:48] zen__cloud: i really hope LCS/LEC adopt bo3's at some point this year
[2:55:10] fljqpy: if u have to make items for a role to exist just dont
[2:55:21] DixMX: @zen__cloud LEC has Bo3s after group stage
[2:55:31] Birbmang_: what a cancerous strat
[2:55:37] najafan: @fljqpy No, bring back tracker's knife.

[2:55:58] Loxi9: @fx_fanslowika and that doesnt mean every jungler should be good independent of their team like what is that logic even
[2:55:59] RawssDeBawss: when wunder stepped off the pc stage area, he was still near enough the same height as perkz.
[2:55:59] Riqour: was that a midget?
[2:56:03] imainleesin: not interesting the 100t or TL?
[2:56:06] TroyThe2nd: flakked is so amazingly small
[2:56:08] imainleesin: *interested

[2:56:12] shahzaad: what do you think of heretics? they have stomped 3 games in a row now
[2:56:13] Loxi9: ur saying bo should be insane because other junglers do well inspite of their team
[2:56:13] RawssDeBawss: dude must be like 18ft 6in 12
[2:56:14] airbrid: This was such a weird game
[2:56:24] torgoat: viego is really good into taliyah it seems

[2:56:30] zen__cloud: this game LUL

[2:56:43] fljqpy: nah its not disgusting
[2:56:50] fljqpy: mdk had no chance
[2:56:58] Youistheniqq: so…is it the support item or seraphine?  like I know for sure 2 support items are busted
[2:57:02] archie7497: This was a game of league of legends
[2:57:10] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 i say that bo is not playing well, he had teams built around him (vta kc) and its not working
[2:57:14] DixMX: this game was weird
[2:57:22] RawssDeBawss: Mikyx also the best Gragas in G2 + a Lissandra enjoyer.
[2:57:27] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 if u want to argue that vita and kc are shit roster constricution then i can agree
[2:57:39] heckintim: ahhh heimerdinger. the first champ i picked up over 8 years ago when i started
[2:57:52] Loxi9: @fx_fanslowika thats exactly what im saying, kc and vitality are rosters with big names but these players should never be allowed to play with each other
[2:58:06] DixMX: the Zyra incident
[2:58:28] RawssDeBawss: Mikyx been studying from the PoohManDu book of supports
[2:58:35] fx_fanslowika: @Loxi9 then we agree, bo team should have nisqy/trymbi or somebody who takes comms away from him and helps him with the map
[2:58:47] Loxi9: @fx_fanslowika ye exactly
[2:59:04] DixMX: @fx_fanslowika Nisqy would be perfect in KC yea
[2:59:04] najafan: Give Heimer his Zzrot and Banner back!
[2:59:20] RawssDeBawss: @fx_fanslowika Bo + Nisqy would be so ridiculously unfair for every other team to exist. Ever.
[2:59:44] fx_fanslowika: @fx_fanslowika thats not even remotely true id still have caps yike easily above them and razork humanoid in form too
[2:59:52] airbrid: How different is it from Cait Lux, the Varus Zyra lane
[3:00:22] DixMX: @MonteCristo can you move cam a bit lower?
[3:00:34] Loxi9: i mean its pointless to shadowbox mid/jg

[3:01:38] archie7497: @montecristo do you know why only lec has the gold difference between opposing laners in their ui?
[3:01:39] 2022LINKS: no way first strike is better than comet+scorch

[3:02:16] SPUDonSTEROIDSgames: hey @MonteCristo bit of an unrelated question, but do you still believe that the esports scene is worth something to pursue? As a videographer or journalist? It seems with this "esports winter" everything is negative

[3:34:55] fljqpy: no fiesta
[3:34:56] archie7497: Dom was tilted by this game cuz his kills under missed by 1 kill. If g2 clean 5-0 ace'd he would have hit
[3:35:04] AzureCatalyst: If you want a fiesta. Dig vs IMT will make you want to bleach your eyes
[3:35:09] riley_bruce_: BDS had the biggest fiesta game of the week
[3:35:13] fljqpy: costreamers just say INT every 5 seconds
[3:35:13] AzureCatalyst: Noooo
[3:35:14] fatalqwerty: Monte are we not gonna watch DK vs KT live? Im ready to not get excited about this KT lineup tbh

[3:38:01] smithpw: Red are sponsored by Shin? awesome lol
[3:38:08] Noobishwizard: So its just unintuitive and we've already been conditions by years
[3:38:09] fljqpy: at least wait till the playoffs to rank the teams lol
[3:38:18] UpYerArs: knowing Riot Korea they wont do shit
[3:38:25] imainleesin: do you think LCS overlay will be different tomorrow?
[3:38:31] fartnugget45: Kiin played fine but Canyon carried imo
[3:38:32] ArkhamAvalon: it seems like a bunch of teams just want to pick away the milio
[3:38:58] grandezelx: i cant believe canyon is on perma tank duty
[3:39:22] imainleesin: does Darius clap Udyr?
[3:39:35] grandezelx: unlesss udyr takes ignite
[3:39:48] fartnugget45: Darius claps Udyr when Canyon is your jungler 4Head
[3:39:51] grandezelx: darius beats udyr
[3:39:54] fatalqwerty: Darius DOES NOT clap udyr
[3:40:17] zen__cloud: not if peanut's 2023 champ pool has anything to say about it
[3:40:27] archie7497: Did cuzz turn into a pumpkin?
[3:40:32] UpYerArs: @MonteCristo GenG got rid of Peanut, a serial choker with another serial choker Kiin. This org cant catch a break
[3:41:08] Rumblextristana: Hope to at least see canyon play lee once this season.
[3:41:12] eck1e: i love that half of udyrs strength is that he can effectively itemise in a myriad of ways
[3:41:23] grandezelx: honestly chovy is so good both series i understand why people say he is the best player in the world then i see him at internationals i want to kms

[3:42:18] SPUDonSTEROIDSgames: how to chinese viewers watch LCK with that drama?
[3:42:28] UpYerArs: Chovy becoming the Aaron Rogers of league
[3:42:35] grandezelx: canyon is so good
[3:42:39] archie7497: @montecristo ghost tp udyr loses to darius but if udyr takes flash ignite he beats Darius. Ignite to reduce Darius q heal mainly and flash to dodge q or e
[3:42:49] bluegrassbat: @UpYerArs chovy is Dak
[3:42:53] grandezelx: mid jg is the best in league probably the world
[3:42:57] eck1e: @SPUDonSTEROIDSgames where there is a will there is a way, i'd assume there are some bootleg streams running for now

[3:47:32] Fire_elemen6: so that means thursday will be any important announcements by the LoL Leagues?
[3:47:37] grandezelx: monday is for monte and wolf,tuesday is for si,wed is for best damn lol and powerspike
[3:47:45] Invert_lol: red side bot lane is so sad, i'm surprised teams don't laneswap and go double support item topside as red where they can safely dbl farm it
[3:48:43] The_LostProphet: I mean I find it awkward the map is no longer Asymmetrical with blue top jungle being different to red bot jungle
[3:48:56] The_LostProphet: Symmetrical not Asymmetrical
[3:49:02] archie7497: I swear taliyah is bait
[3:49:18] archie7497: I don't know why chovy picks it
[3:50:01] Gunloth: The mini map is no longer so mini
[3:50:47] grandezelx: canyon looks in form
[3:51:33] fljqpy: how is it easy
[3:52:05] ArkhamAvalon: im sure playing with kiin is also a lot easier given how good he was last year

[3:52:48] grandezelx: i mean the reason for canyon prime was having the best topside in lol history
[3:52:51] smithpw: Keria max W on Milio and Lehends is doing E. Anyone know if this is matched based?
[3:53:03] grandezelx: this team has a chance
[3:53:11] The_LostProphet: @invert_lol I mean in theory sounds like the better plan for red when the blue jungle is weak. Force a fast and early grub with duo top
[3:53:11] grandezelx: to reawaken canyon
[3:53:21] senorpink123: gen g with a top laner is broken
[3:54:06] archie7497: What's funny is that despite dying 3 times peyz is still in the minion farming penalty zone
[3:54:52] fljqpy: doran did fine dont diss
[3:55:15] ArkhamAvalon: chovy just zoning the team so kiin can take plates. gotta love it LUL
[3:55:28] The_LostProphet: Kiin carry
[3:55:31] UpYerArs: gotta respect doran for being zeus' father
[3:55:34] smithpw: Only 200g bounty for 3k ahead?
[3:55:39] Joaz: GODS are good Kappa clearly took notes from adam
[3:55:46] fljqpy: geng barely lost to blg who knows what would happen
[3:56:48] ArkhamAvalon: its ok the support item is probably equaling out the gold between him and jiwoo
[3:56:54] MarquisDeHueberez: who's that in top lane? Is that udyr?
[3:57:12] archie7497: That's was a hylli wave
[3:57:29] Joaz: @MarquisDeHueberez udyr v darius

[3:58:46] fljqpy: uh oh the real carry arrives
[3:58:50] The_LostProphet: You know it was a great attempt untill it wasn't :(
[3:58:59] MissingMatter: He just wants to axe them a few questions
[3:59:02] fljqpy: its just aphelios support
[3:59:06] zen__cloud: kiin 0 reaction
[3:59:07] GelatoSquid: you could hear the jaws theme as he walked in from the jungle LUL
[3:59:16] hazygreys: i enjoy keane
[3:59:18] Rumblextristana: Kiin is very fun to watch.
[3:59:19] grandezelx: casue he is a choker
[3:59:20] Noobishwizard: Bin and Zeus are pretty good as well :)
[3:59:23] zen__cloud: a lot of people seem to like TheShy
[3:59:26] MarquisDeHueberez: Because flame exist
[3:59:28] The_LostProphet: You mean Kiin(g)
[3:59:36] archie7497: @montecristo other players don't choke at internationals
[3:59:37] senorpink123: other player win titles
[3:59:43] Youistheniqq: this gen g winning spring?
[3:59:51] Tears_0f_sin: so you're saying i should be a geng fan? i haven't watched much league in a couple years
[3:59:51] UpYerArs: Cause Bin owns @MonteCristo
[3:59:53] Raioh1er: But does he play Kayle?
[4:00:05] fljqpy: kiin did ok into jdg lol
[4:00:21] grandezelx: bro
[4:00:22] grandezelx: wtf
[4:00:25] fatalqwerty: Kiin single-handedly holding all of GenG's hopes and dreams in this game
[4:00:58] grandezelx: zues second year iin play while kiin is on his  seventh year
[4:00:59] Noobishwizard: Yeah the scoreline doesnt show it but Canyon has a great game
[4:01:07] kerokerogrips: i missed a couple of hours what was monte;s impression of c9
[4:01:08] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo why do LCK players seem to have such better movement than LCS
[4:01:38] smithpw: This is like my solo q macro
[4:01:50] fatalqwerty: Kiin single-handedly routing NS
[4:02:08] MissingMatter: Kiin just casually up 70cs at 18 minutes, strolls into teamfight late and suddenly it's a full retreat
[4:02:26] archie7497: What the fuck is dndn's inventory
[4:02:57] MissingMatter: "Hey guys, I'm here for the teamfight." "What teamfight? There's no teamfight, we were just, um, checking the river for pollution. We'll be going now."

[4:03:08] GelatoSquid: kiin has double his gold OMEGALUL
[4:03:09] MannyAki: he's so poor
[4:03:14] fartnugget45: Looks like the most miserable game for a top laner lmao
[4:03:16] fljqpy: can ff

[4:04:05] TheTraderKing: HLE vs KDF is a banger LUL
[4:04:21] fljqpy: botlane in s14
[4:04:28] kerokerogrips: @fatalqwerty no sponser obligations and wut not
[4:04:30] CaptMalReynolds: Canyon's Taliyah is so damn clean
[4:04:49] SloppyTiger: hes on sej u mean chovy m8
[4:04:57] archie7497: Nah as if dndn built anathema's and put it on Darius. Anathema doesn't even reduce darius' r damage. This is so troll
[4:04:58] senorpink123: if this gen g not winning worlds i will give up on chovy
[4:05:02] fljqpy: ahh yes adc in 2024
[4:05:04] fatalqwerty: @TheTraderKing did it reach game 3? I thought it was gonna be a sweep
[4:05:12] fartnugget45: Every time NS wants to do something Canyon is just there saying "No"
[4:05:19] fljqpy: lost to full tank sejuani
[4:05:26] zen__cloud: dndn went anathemas first item LuL
[4:05:30] ArkhamAvalon: LUL and he just has anathemas
[4:05:51] zen__cloud: flash 4 man pull is insa
[4:05:56] AzureCatalyst: Jesus
[4:05:57] zen__cloud: kiin got the flash 4 man pull*
[4:06:17] Rumblextristana: Someone actually voted for peyz as the mvp for this game. Lol
[4:06:18] fljqpy: why even bother ganking botlane
[4:06:20] Diphallus: that udyr regen is insane
[4:06:20] heckintim: dndn less damage then lehends milio POG
[4:06:27] MannyAki: lmao
[4:06:36] fljqpy: its just 2 supports in botlane
[4:06:44] ArkhamAvalon: kiin is so good
[4:07:07] AzureCatalyst: That is an insane stomp holy
[4:07:11] SirKavouris: wait they played aphelios double support item?
[4:07:32] fljqpy: he bought support item LATER tho

[4:09:10] fatalqwerty: is Kiin gonna roll on Udyr with Olaf?
[4:09:53] ArkhamAvalon: yeah thats true. I've always liked watching kiin.
[4:09:59] zen__cloud: where do you put nongshim in the ranks of LCK?
[4:10:04] fatalqwerty: most versatile top of all time?
[4:10:08] d_kowalski: He can also play Sion SeemsGood
[4:10:14] UpYerArs: T1 stans are going to come for your throat man
[4:10:25] PlasticBombs: how's bro this year?
[4:10:44] Diphallus: bluside cheese
[4:10:45] AzureCatalyst: Oh wow
[4:10:50] AzureCatalyst: That's a cool cheese
[4:10:55] MannyAki: weird
[4:11:12] d_kowalski: Well anyway Adam Olaf was brutal on Oscar Udyr yesterday
[4:11:23] AzureCatalyst: Also lucian started w
[4:11:29] AzureCatalyst: The W start gives him a bit of movespeed
[4:11:35] AzureCatalyst: Which gives him empowered autos for the trade
[4:11:45] UpYerArs: crazy they won the trade with casters hitting them @MonteCristo
[4:12:06] fartnugget45: Oh lucian is FS not PTA
[4:12:25] eck1e: also pathing like that makes it more likely to get the full first strike value lvl1
[4:12:30] Noobishwizard: Chovy has looked pretty rough with Taliyah
[4:12:34] AzureCatalyst: This also looks like a secondary rune tree difference too. Aphelios went Red Tree and Lucian went Inspiration so he also has cookies which alow him to sustain up after the level 1 all in
[4:12:42] fljqpy: its just taliyah
[4:13:47] zen__cloud: olaf bullying udyr too

[4:14:51] AzureCatalyst: I'm actually super impressed with this Gen.G's composure and macro thus far
[4:15:58] CaptMalReynolds: I think that's a really good buy
[4:16:46] fljqpy: the word "int" must go
[4:16:51] fljqpy: way overused
[4:17:46] Len_xyz: dndn could have double E and lived there right?
[4:17:56] akabunniesonspeed: jiwoo not going sup item in either game

[4:20:01] CaptMalReynolds: void grubs are such a good addition I think. Might be overtuned but hard to tell
[4:20:06] Noobishwizard: How strong do you think the grubs are? Because herald seems weaker
[4:20:11] fartnugget45: Milio OP
[4:20:13] AzureCatalyst: Oh wow
[4:20:17] AzureCatalyst: They did so much damage jesus
[4:20:30] AzureCatalyst: 5 grubs is better than a drak
[4:20:36] AzureCatalyst: 3 grubs is worse than a drake I think
[4:20:56] GelatoSquid: the first grubs give a shitload of xp
[4:21:02] GelatoSquid: they let me get 6 a lot sooner
[4:21:02] jerckysminion: yeah that sounds pretty right azuyre
[4:21:23] akabunniesonspeed: ya i think they should use tp adv more
[4:21:26] fljqpy: taliyah gaming
[4:21:55] hokie2004: grub respawn is 4 minutes right?
[4:21:55] grandezelx: yone and rakan have 100 percent win rate in lck
[4:21:56] jerckysminion: lehends is so dead here
[4:21:59] jerckysminion: what
[4:22:51] AzureCatalyst: The milio tech is to use your kick when they're using their dashes to engage and Lehends is doing it really well on the tristana stuff
[4:22:52] AzureCatalyst: He executed
[4:22:54] fljqpy: ayyy
[4:22:55] AzureCatalyst: To give the gold to milio
[4:23:15] fartnugget45: Ya Chovy wasn't in vision I don't think. Didn't want to feed him a ton of gold
[4:23:42] AzureCatalyst: Now That I'm thinking about it. Milio, Taliyah, and Rell are fantastic pics to try and interrupt dashes and stop the tristana resets
[4:25:03] AzureCatalyst: That was so good from chovy

[4:25:13] catanenjoyer: chovy best taliyah world
[4:25:36] Noobishwizard: Lot better from Chovy this game
[4:25:52] fartnugget45: Yeah perfect grouping while olaf splits
[4:26:00] MannyAki: playing the map really well
[4:27:01] AzureCatalyst: Also the removal of Demonic has actually made Maokai a much less versatile pick. He can't really go any of the new AP items in place of demonic. He's pretty much just a support tank now
[4:28:01] fartnugget45: Watching Udyr racecar around cracks me up
[4:28:06] AzureCatalyst: Taliyah, Milio, Rell, and Lucian are such a fast 4 man unit with the rell spped, the taliyah rock gliding and the milio speed
[4:28:21] AzureCatalyst: Like they can cover so much distance without even considering taliyah wall
[4:28:23] brandofan2: yeah i just went into the kitchen to grab drink and Canyon was there
[4:28:34] Diphallus: milio into maokai makes the ult completely useless
[4:29:34] AzureCatalyst: Like Tristana is 5-1 and Callme feels so pressured to try and make an assassination play on taliyah because of how much NS are bleeding out on the map

[4:30:38] Noobishwizard: Yeah double adc rip
[4:30:45] boomju89: best of 3’s allow teams to become more comfortable with one another
[4:30:46] fljqpy: adc in s14
[4:30:49] AzureCatalyst: JESUS CHRIST
[4:30:57] archie7497: Ns really chose a 1.5 items vs 2 item fight willingly huh...
[4:30:59] brandofan2: DnDn went to zone instead of confirming on Rell
[4:31:12] S1lentSymphony: Gen.G just picked that fight perfectly on that Q
[4:31:13] akabunniesonspeed: interesting that the tp advantage hasnt amounted to anything so far in either game
[4:31:16] fartnugget45: Even at the beginning he made sure to land the stun on trist which saved him so hard
[4:31:35] sennah21: no ap
[4:31:38] AzureCatalyst: Did Nongshim force that fight with Jiwoo unable to hit?
[4:31:49] AzureCatalyst: Oh damn the red gun runs out just at the start of tgthe fight
[4:32:11] brandofan2: yeah DnDn tried to go on Peyz there thinking Canyon was dead
[4:32:13] Noobishwizard: GenG already feel like they still retained alot of their teamplay from last year. Very exciting even this early on
[4:32:14] brandofan2: which is a faiir assumption
[4:32:18] AzureCatalyst: Oh wow Jiwoo pretty much hits rell with like 5 full chakram hits and Rell lives jesus
[4:33:06] SirKavouris: so geng no more resident sleeper
[4:33:08] fljqpy: this is what damwon wants to be
[4:33:09] AzureCatalyst: This feels like a souped up KT? from last year. I'm getting flashbacks to the BDD TF collapse comps
[4:33:17] akabunniesonspeed: callme done with this one
[4:33:33] frieza558: who is better top laner Kiin or Irrelevant?
[4:33:39] Len_xyz: this GenG actually feels entertaining to watch and not just one style played all games
[4:34:07] AzureCatalyst: I like this new GenG though. I liked old Gen G but this new version makes me excited for the future
[4:34:09] Noobishwizard: I'm ready to hopefully see GenG play to their potential internationally without Peanut lol
[4:34:15] arthradot: is it time to join tiger nation

[4:35:34] Noobishwizard: Samsung were 1st in alot of splits. They just collapsed in playoffs for a while
[4:35:48] AzureCatalyst: I lowkey think that Peanut going to HLE is actually a fantastic steal for HLE and really shores up alot of the weaknesses they had
[4:36:05] AzureCatalyst: I'm extremely excited for the new HLE and how they develop without a gaping hole in the Jungle position
