[1:36:58] pielord599: @pielord599 i feel like he doesnt do enough magic damage for it to be good, like only his e does magic and only based on your ap. so shadaowflame by itself would barely do any extra dam
[1:37:28] pielord599: @pielord599 and if you build ie in a full ap build, then it would hurt your e damage a lot too, since youre prob missing out on a core item
[1:37:45] piggietheone: you can drag it out of your screen
[1:37:57] gavasa: ya feels like a tft build, skill crit
[1:38:05] natearistata: well, you did just say you didn't want to win
