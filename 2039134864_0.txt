[1:56:52] Lionbrine: “Community” Kappa (Autism clinic)
[1:56:54] AdiosOcelote: I'd go as far as to say you don't have a community. I say that because most of your viewers just come to see League, barely anyone comes to see how you're doing etc. Just my opinion
[1:56:57] Mlucky2: are you trying to do what destiny did
[1:57:06] wolfmancan: cowsep dot com BibleThump
[1:57:20] pitou4444: why not stream league 4h as the "job part of the day"  and then change up to something else you actually want to play or stream? even if the viewership goes down to 100people, it doesnt matter, the job part/making money is already done
[1:57:24] RickLUL: theres great people that watch you... and fathai

[1:59:29] yhakaishin: but bro cant u see all the things cool you have ?
[1:59:35] pitou4444: Was aying that in case you wanted to switch your viewership from one game to another without losing income in the meantime
[1:59:38] AdiosOcelote: I like how you add to add that you play Street Fighters to then go jerk off and play some more. I appreciate the honest detail
[1:59:39] yhakaishin: the cool things *
[1:59:55] AdiosOcelote: had to add*
[2:00:12] LeptonDecay: Pog leaked Cowsep revenue
[2:00:15] yhakaishin: league is just pulling out all the happiness u have
[2:00:21] Lionbrine: Damn bro you make like more than me when streaming
[2:00:34] Knijz: how mutch on us taxes? @Cowsep
[2:00:49] LaatiMafia: This might be a silly question, but do you get ad revenue if an ad is blocked? Hmm
[2:01:01] turkeyfingazz: is any job fully pleasing and just fun? hmm. sometimes it needs changes
[2:01:18] yhakaishin: You're cool, you entertain me, you make good master yi content that I like and follow
[2:01:38] yhakaishin: Why are you not good enough?
[2:01:44] AdiosOcelote: Blocked ads are flagged as not watched/not displayed
[2:01:44] OpaqueColours: Can you still stream in Korea after twitch is cutting the cord?
[2:01:50] Knijz: im here cuz of streamer to be honest im kinda disgusted by your yi gameplay DansGame
[2:01:51] LeptonDecay: I mean, what hobbies or interests do you have outside of gaming?

[2:14:58] the_acidrain: 한국어에서 가장 좋아하는 단어는 무엇입니까
[2:14:58] jaerin_t: hi cowsep
[2:15:11] Kennyl4d: So you are an hermit when you don't speak english ?
[2:15:11] Jukettaja: I remember when Minecraft was still huge a lot of YouTubers felt trapped. Somehow they managed to transition to another game. Like Binding of Isaac and later Monster Hunter.
[2:15:38] LeptonDecay: @the_acidrain 똥
[2:15:45] Kennyl4d: @the_acidrain how did you find cowsep?
[2:16:01] the_acidrain: cowsep found me when we fell in love
[2:16:08] jaketw562: Have you ever considered moving back to the States then?
[2:16:16] Lionbrine: friend PauseChamp
[2:16:16] Kennyl4d: Ohhh, fuck baddies I see
[2:16:26] LeptonDecay: ohio beckons you and awaits your return cowsep... LUL
[2:16:29] Kennyl4d: So you are an hermit when you don't speak english?
[2:16:34] Jukettaja: I think it just came down to throwing games at a wall and seeing what garnered a half-decent audience until it grew enough to jump ship from Minecraft or other games that they no longer had interest in.
[2:16:44] the_acidrain: i think i first actually stayed on a cowsep stream when i saw him in unity
[2:16:44] JaGarreN: How will you stream on twitch from korea after the shutdown? @Cowsep
[2:16:49] LeptonDecay: What about seeing your mom again BibleThump
[2:17:20] Lionbrine: don’t want to be hermit but everything costs in the states, and cheaper hobbies are so fucking boring
[2:17:25] warframeme69: what is the korea shutdown?
[2:17:30] yhakaishin: ruuuuuuuuuuun
[2:17:34] Pesicc: if we ace them, jhin akali and teemo on our team(we are all 70%hp) , we could take inhib easy or maybe do baron( our jg was on 5 sec respawn) what would you do ?
[2:17:40] jaketw562: What's the Korean shutdown?
[2:17:53] blacKmarkeTzyrA: @warframeme69 twitch killing korean servers
[2:17:56] Jukettaja: Korea is too expensive for Twitch I believe
[2:17:56] brunchmenus: where are you living today cowdad?
[2:18:08] Greeky420: do you think this ping is good?
[2:18:09] warframeme69: oh damn

[2:19:49] RexMundiDeus: you are korean now?
[2:19:53] LeptonDecay: I don't understand, why do they have to remove Korean access to Twitch if it costs nothing to let them just connect to a non-korean server for the service?
[2:19:59] BotRixOficial: @Mlucky2 Please do not send links.
[2:20:00] LeptonDecay: Is there some cost I don't understand?
[2:20:12] LeptonDecay: huh interesting
[2:20:40] the_acidrain: you can probably just set up an rtmp relay server on a digital ocean droplet huh
[2:20:40] Mlucky2: it wasnt twitch fault from what i remb. didnt they end net neutrality over there
[2:20:58] jaerin_t: i think most of the korean streamers use AfreecaTV
[2:21:04] Lionbrine: let me hack ur relay server
[2:21:13] Jukettaja: You're just going through the motions in League

[2:22:20] pitou4444: been here 8months, ive seen ups and downs though in your enjoyment! But yeah overall didnt like the game anymore
[2:22:35] Demiurgo13S: why dont you do something you like?
[2:22:38] yhakaishin: so the answer is to get another level of life, and u get another level when u abandon all the things u cannot control, and controll what u CAN controll,  who u cannot control you just GIVE to LORD, thats what i make to live, but the life It must be different for you, so I don't know or I don't have any good advice for you, but I wish you all the best, my brother.

[2:29:46] LeptonDecay: you forgot the part where jessica from HR needs to tell the entire team about her sister's dog that ran away over the weekend and how her daughter is on her way to high school for 30 minutes before you actually get to move on with work @Lionbrine

[2:48:48] Latrelz: samsung is just better
[2:48:50] StDismus: you make more in 5 years
[2:48:54] mytzusky: S24 has 7 y of os updates
[2:48:59] mustaakahvia: S23 also lacks the long software support that was promised for S24.
[2:49:04] izic4: boots?
[2:49:06] koga_ryu: 10% is a lot
[2:49:19] LeptonDecay: it's an investment that will last me 5+ years, you're paying for quality, something that apple users dont know about lol @andrewwryan
[2:49:19] the_acidrain: 24k is like... minimum wage job
[2:49:34] LaatiMafia: @Cowsep 2k a month would be 2 Dollars a month in 10 years due to inflation YEP
[2:49:39] lyszalud: i am not buying samsung phones anymore, the decay of the battery and the charging port is inferior to competitors
[2:49:56] Lionbrine: I would take 10% stocks are risk at end of the day
[2:49:58] Mr_Aek: the 10x zoom is wild, when I was on a trip everyone had ne forward the pictures of the sloths cause iphone zoom was a spec on the screen and I had a full picture of it

[2:51:06] Lionbrine: Despair
[2:51:08] koga_ryu: hard to find replacement parts for that phone, but that phone is worth a lot on the market
[2:51:10] AGXest: hello @Cowsep ! How you doing ?
[2:51:11] blacKmarkeTzyrA: do u clean out where u plug in the charger to your phone?

[2:53:34] mustaakahvia: Never understood the fold hype. 1: they’re super bulky, 2: the middle part of the screen where it folds is super ugly.
[2:53:44] PurpleTulip007: 1200
[2:53:52] blacKmarkeTzyrA: i don't remember but i was way overdue for an upgrade
