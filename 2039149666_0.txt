[2:32:46] surely_not_faker: !thinking
[2:32:46] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.
