[2:32:51] Lazynameross: nasus couldve left at like 4 mins but he has to flex his pettiness ig
[2:33:07] CharlieBGood: all that in a normal game
[2:33:20] CharlieBGood: it shows the mental issue
[2:33:31] Quaak3: if nasus left the game he would get the ban hammer, but doing this he wont
[2:34:21] Lazynameross: this dude isnt even soft inting, hes to the point enemy team has folks that will report him
[2:34:27] CharlieBGood: running it down intentionnally gets you banned WAAAAY faster than just leaving the game
[2:34:38] Quaak3: that's how riot do, ban on afk ppl but not trolls like this one
[2:34:54] CharlieBGood: leaving games results of low prio queue and waiting time up to 20 mins
[2:35:07] CharlieBGood: running down straight gives you days of ban
[2:35:26] Chris_Twitch: just one day -.-
[2:35:44] CharlieBGood: more like a week

[2:43:20] YolkBun: want to lose NODDERS
[2:43:29] Lazynameross: is this the same guy or are all nasuses deranged today
[2:43:57] w22do: great mentality there
[2:44:24] CharlieBGood: maybe that nasus was sent by CIA or FBI to test Ipav's patience today
[2:44:30] Lazynameross: people like this need to take less time playing league and more time bettering themselves
[2:44:31] CharlieBGood: streamsnipe

[3:14:12] beric_saito: MONKAWAI
[3:14:52] CharlieBGood: by looking at current state of the game, maybe the rundown nasus wasn't the worst option
[3:14:57] pikapika_666_: 3 flashes after going to bot :)
[3:17:14] CharlieBGood: not even close
