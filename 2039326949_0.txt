[1:36:53] Danielumalament: what elo is this btw?
[1:37:13] Pierce7d: Protobelt is not meant to be a hyper scaling item. It's meant to be a kit enabling component, so it's priced accessibly. I think it was a good decision. There are plenty of good items for scaling, and even the defensive utility items were given a Needlessly large rod for meaningful damage
