[1:23:26] BytecastRach: still good though
[1:23:42] louiecheese: yeee haaa music

[1:26:42] BytecastRach: Yeah people always have a stigma about country but there is so many different genres of country and styles
[1:27:08] mkramer2000: Here is a better explanation of the difference-While country music shares the stringed instruments of folk singers, they added steel and electric guitars, dobros, and often percussion instruments
[1:27:34] moto_monk: Season 1 team comp
[1:28:05] BytecastRach: these were incredible live!

[2:05:40] TorqueBandit: yeah, ty
[2:06:06] frankenfoot5: Hey Santorin, do you recommend picking junglers based on our team comp or junglers that I am better on? Even if they don't provide group utility
[2:06:24] DJ_Photik: Lee Fun?
[2:08:05] frankenfoot5: It does make sense! I appreciate that! I'm a support main transitioning to jungler main, so my champ pool is still relatively small. I'm just still not used to picking selfishly
[2:09:02] sennara: is bel vussy strong rn?

[2:10:39] Lukeskywalkoh: santorin i have an issue where i keep watching streams instead of playing ranked
[2:11:58] Offsette7: i feel my jungle gameplay very messy, the enemy jungle can gank successfully and keep a superior farm FeelsBadMan
[2:12:08] Offsette7: but i want to improve
[2:12:13] mkramer2000: I watch streams way to much. I honestly enjoy watching streams more than playing because I'm bad at them lmfao
[2:12:23] mkramer2000: Bad the games*
[2:13:27] Offsette7: yeah! 3 lvl gank screw me a lot
[2:14:24] DrThorongil: ganks are way more coin-flippy at low elo, too, which means farming camps can be more reliable
[2:15:49] Bodhipsyche: Can confirm been ganking a lot more than last season and am having way more trouble despite my main being op
[2:15:58] Offsette7: the frustating part is the enemy jungle can successfully gank, they walk by and kill
[2:17:40] Offsette7: i think i dont know how to predict if the gank is viable while im farming
[2:18:03] TorqueBandit: mammia mia
[2:19:06] TorqueBandit: we need a player lobbying group
[2:19:15] Velraptured: Funny that Sion isn't the example there
[2:19:35] frankenfoot5: Are the grubs even really worth it? Or should dragon be a higher priority?

[2:32:03] morbidnumbskull: Instead of "useless" let's use 'Teletubby' for WW okay? KEKW
[2:33:51] morbidnumbskull: Oh sht, it's that bad? LUL
[2:34:02] brgross: He can be a gremlin lol
[2:34:09] morbidnumbskull: damn, we gotta figure out something worse than Teletubbie then
[2:34:21] DJ_Photik: Ww bonk

[2:38:46] brgross: I choose to watch league for fun rather than play it lol
[2:38:57] dragontroopbeta2: Heard your name mentioned on stage. Thought it was pretty cute.
[2:39:42] dragontroopbeta2: Post-game interview. I think it was Sniper who said your name awkwardly and immediately followed with "Not that he was a bad player, he was great."
[2:42:06] dragontroopbeta2: I have 0 grasp on the meta. I'm a D1+/master jungle and EVERY champion I play seems to work.
[2:42:24] dragontroopbeta2: Diana, Hecarim, Jax, even frickin XERATH worked.
[2:42:42] sennara: whatre teh best jjunglers

[2:44:36] Bodhipsyche: 100%
[2:45:39] williamcoe22: I feel like they need to reduce the amount of jungle camps now that they added grubs
[2:46:15] DJ_Photik: So many priorities
[2:46:26] KiroTh3Hero: it all started with the scuttle crab
[2:46:32] KiroTh3Hero: we all thought it was harmless
[2:47:09] DJ_Photik: Farm farm farm objectives objectives gank gank why jg gap
[2:47:25] dragontroopbeta2: Last season I went from a 1325 gold full clear to an 1150 full clear and now its like... 1100.
[2:48:16] nikolas_prekas: nikolas_prekas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hellooo!
[2:48:17] DJ_Photik: You don't ask to jg if you get diff role?
[2:48:39] dragontroopbeta2: It wasn't unsuual in S11/12 to slow clear and be able to back and get dirk and boots then lane gank. Now I get like... a longsword and red gem.

[2:55:51] Quiettoad: He is roleplaying an actual predator
[2:56:08] Velraptured: Nah that's legit
[2:56:25] Velraptured: One of the eastern Sylas otps goes predator into stormsurge
[2:56:56] noahtheknower: he going ingenious hunter regardless so it has good value
[2:57:24] Velraptured: Predator lets him run at them and get in their face for almost guaranteed e
[3:00:49] DJ_Photik: Guaranteed Eeeeeee
[3:01:00] Zeiik101: you might have baited him there

[3:16:37] williamcoe22: gg you’re op against the demons
[3:16:42] BowmanSX3: griefed
[3:16:46] DJ_Photik: Simon demon
[3:16:51] lubemila: santorinQ
[3:17:07] xLippyy: instead of teletubbies they can be Lolipoppies
[3:17:43] lubemila: santorinLUL
[3:17:58] williamcoe22: why no play ivern, udyr, nunu?

[3:22:52] Fiezzari: @Santorin You should live like this with her. Whoever loses more games in a day has to make dinner that day, watch her tryhard her shit out of league
[3:22:55] solitigre: kid flash
[3:24:37] Fiezzari: @Santorin Do you have a tierlist for this season?
[3:24:57] mkramer2000: Yay nunu
[3:25:11] lookoutitscaleb: I won 5 games in a row then lost 5 games in a row TT
[3:27:03] mkramer2000: The fact that kid can do that without even having his full height is impressive
[3:27:43] mkramer2000: Like imagine what he can do when he has longer legs
[3:27:59] mkramer2000: Time to camp botlane
[3:28:04] Boh14: What is the ideal footwear for gaming?
[3:28:14] mkramer2000: @boh14 none
[3:28:19] Frost212: So....as someone who only plays Seraphine in aram, (where she's nerfed as heck) what makes her so dumb on Summoners rift?
[3:28:37] nightpieqtblue: Naked just socks
[3:28:51] mkramer2000: @frost212 it's not just her it's the double enchanter with two support items
[3:29:06] mkramer2000: It gets very annoying
[3:29:25] mkramer2000: But Riot is going to make it so that only one support item can be bought on a team
[3:29:34] mkramer2000: So hopefully that helps
[3:29:34] Frost212: ....Didn't we have that broken double support item interaction several seasons ago? With uh...Targons brace?
[3:30:24] mkramer2000: They weren't expecting the double tank.
[3:30:27] mkramer2000: Gank*
