[1:32:22] if0rg0t2remember: the previous fear was wholesale copying of material off the internet for things like reports or papers, now AI can turn that up to 11 by rewriting the same thing to avoid plagiarism

[1:46:03] ferriswheel8: @ieatthemforaliving lmao same
[1:46:35] anarkhali: nice bait
[1:46:59] ieatthemforaliving: @ferriswheel8 How was it brah ??
[1:47:07] ajak636: hate how strong the suction is on that skill
[1:47:13] pusheencatt1: hello everyone
[1:47:22] ferriswheel8: @ieatthemforaliving it was great, but exhausting
[1:47:23] ferriswheel8: wbu
[1:47:25] shuckleknuckle7: Hi Kels
[1:47:33] anarkhali: hello pusheencat
[1:47:35] SickeningTouchLoL: that pull is so strong.
[1:47:46] aty212121: Eee guessed wrong
[1:47:51] pusheencatt1: how are the games going today?
[1:47:58] bleublanch: He's obsessed
[1:48:00] SickeningTouchLoL: yes it is
[1:48:04] shuckleknuckle7: Hey Kels, I havent been here in a while, have you played lux this season? super super fun
[1:48:25] shuckleknuckle7: it may or may not be very xd
[1:48:45] OptimusBrian1357: Just watched your "useless pick" ahri video and it was the first vid of yours that I watched and it was awesome, Kelsie! üòÅüëåüèæ
[1:48:49] shuckleknuckle7: I just got to Plat 2 last game :) highest ive ever been
[1:48:53] Egolenias: What makes his e so strong is that it BOTH slows and pulls which makes the pull stronger
[1:49:04] watson1235: kaypUpsetti
[1:49:13] RsBIur: i feel like sol and noc are queued lol
[1:49:19] anarkhali: nocturne literally loves mid
[1:49:20] Mister_Luna: unlucky PoroSad
[1:49:23] ajak636: they're duo for sure
[1:49:24] bleublanch: The noc is so obsessed
[1:49:26] ieatthemforaliving: @ferriswheel8 SAME. I panicked asft ho.
[1:49:31] ieatthemforaliving: asf tho*.
[1:49:33] rj_banana: if I'm not mistaken (since I also play anivia), spellshields like noc and sivir, or even the edge of night can't block the anivia q because there is a damage from the q travelling and an explosion that also stuns, since the stun is at the second part, wouldn't the spellshields be gone even before the stun go off?
[1:49:38] aty212121: BOOM FIREWORK
[1:49:42] kendren25: Acehol and Noc duoQ?
[1:49:45] ieatthemforaliving: BELVETH , WIN FOR MY PTS.
[1:49:46] kendren25: Yeah, beaten
[1:49:50] aty212121: GlitchLit GlitchLit
[1:49:52] shuckleknuckle7: Noc probs saw U Q and realised it was free real estate
[1:50:05] ferriswheel8: @ieatthemforaliving yeah like literally my biggest problem is the stress, even though i usually ace these exams, i dunno how to deal w it
[1:50:18] r1derTV: hi, how r u?
[1:50:26] anarkhali: bel got some kills mid too, at least we have that too
[1:50:34] SpringSong: she could just run trough you
[1:50:36] aside_sue: dw I had a vayne top that died 6 times in 6 minutes...
[1:50:44] agentmilo1: care for nocturne ult
[1:50:56] aty212121: KP LOL Goddess GJ
[1:50:59] ieatthemforaliving: @agentmilo1 Noc ult on bottom. Booo.
[1:51:17] ferriswheel8: @aside_sue Earlier today i had a master yi queued jungle that bought the support item and went top with olaf, both inted and were like 4/22
[1:51:28] Sharko_xD: they died and started blaming
[1:51:33] Egolenias: @rj_banana it depends on the anivia q hitbox because since anivia is old the hitbox for the damage is in the middle while the hitbox for the stun is roughly the circle so you can hit the stun with any damage from the q moving which doesn't proc the spellshield
[1:51:36] anarkhali: GO BEL!
[1:51:43] aside_sue: @ferriswheel8 LMAO
[1:51:56] aty212121: MooooooSe

[2:17:31] ferriswheel8: @yanjii yeah, exactly
[2:17:36] Smoothcollie: @kendren25 I know it's a toxic behaviour. My question is if rito does think the same. Cuz we all know Rito is very questionable in this
[2:17:39] aty212121: It's not me
[2:17:40] SuicideHero: ty
[2:17:44] masilllie: ooohh 3 second ad nice

[2:19:18] CandyDust: league pisses me off that its such a great game with such a terrible community
[2:19:20] ballzagna1: isnt saying GG at the end of the game the courtious thing to do?
[2:19:27] anarkhali: they angry, its how the communicate
[2:19:27] kendren25: @TheAlexJames You would be very surprised
[2:19:29] theenation97: they‚Äôre looking for a reason to feel better about their lives by being toxic in league. . .interesting concept
[2:19:31] jimbob_ywert: I only say ‚Äúez‚Äù when the enemy laner is cocky and toxic towards me. if it‚Äôs mutual I just say ‚Äúggwp‚Äù
[2:19:33] sovitiaisavampire: GG seems okay, gg ez no
[2:19:33] TheAlexJames: i say gg as a legitimate way to say good game when it was close and i won or lost
[2:19:37] ericaborgest: Do you miss Canada, KP?
[2:19:45] aside_sue: do you have multiple accounts on eu too?
[2:19:46] thelunarqueen666: aaah so typing gg is like the "honk if you like pizza" car stickers? good to know
[2:19:51] TheAlexJames: ah okayy :)
[2:19:55] kendren25: @kates_magates You would be very surprised. I went through a phase in my 20s
[2:19:57] TheAlexJames: yeah tocix af :D
[2:19:58] luciano_sm: any advice for someone who plays on 180ping in africa trying to climb

[2:20:15] Smoothcollie: That's why I write "thanks for the game" instead of gg kaypComfy
[2:20:18] masilllie: I used to always try be nice and say gg but people are always rude so I just type nothing anymore
[2:20:20] aty212121: I'm exotic and toxic nice a?
[2:20:30] aside_sue: or "FF"
[2:20:32] IDerpedMyself: Had me thinking I might be an ass for just saying gg LuL
[2:20:33] jimbob_ywert: it‚Äôs like riot is feeding the toxic comments, because they added a title that says ‚Äúmid diff‚Äù so u can apply it to ur banner LOL
[2:20:35] aside_sue: i hate when they type that shit
[2:20:51] sovitiaisavampire: sometimes when i lost i used to write "jungle diff" , i was jungle main Keepo
[2:21:01] ferriswheel8: @Smoothcollie that's so wholesome, ppl should learn from you honestly
[2:21:04] grandmakrystal: how is the food in denmark!?
[2:21:09] kendren25: We can try to convince Tim Hortons to open a shop in Denmark for you
[2:21:14] aty212121: Supreme
[2:21:18] luciano_sm: true
[2:21:21] ferriswheel8: @jimbob_ywert yeah exactly
[2:21:31] sanemelody: But competitiveness does create toxicity
[2:21:34] sovitiaisavampire: is play league
[2:21:45] sovitiaisavampire: :P
[2:21:55] kates_magates: no exactly like you're never going to see those people EVER again
[2:21:57] LuckyToine: kp is spitting facts
[2:21:58] Twayyyy: lmao
[2:22:01] cymatics_crystal: peepoSit
[2:22:01] Twayyyy: "you're shit"
[2:22:11] L3THVL: Is league still toxic?
[2:22:14] CandyDust: I say that to people that treat me like shit tho
[2:22:23] jimbob_ywert: and most UNHAPPY people play LEAGUE! üò≠
[2:22:28] LuckyToine: preach kp preach üôåüèæ
[2:22:31] Dumbmuto: peepoSit
[2:22:37] Smoothcollie: Those people aren't living a happy life, sometimes, I feel bad for them
[2:22:41] mastahkillah_og: Truth
[2:22:46] theenation97: I think it‚Äôs because of the anonymity and how you can use that as an outlet
[2:22:48] Smoothcollie: @umuto123 plink Hope u're doing good kaypFlower
[2:22:53] tofuex91: true
[2:22:53] ferriswheel8: Like how is making a good impact on people whilst seeing them first and last time in your life not a standard?
[2:22:53] jkkzone: true
[2:22:54] aty212121: Wise KP
[2:22:59] Whimie: oh no what happened
[2:23:06] kates_magates: we all have bad games, just get through it and move on, don't ruin other people's day WHO YOU DONT KNOW just because you're a little insecure ü§≠
[2:23:09] Whimie: I just opened stream and kp popping off
[2:23:21] Oval819: why pay for therapy when we got Dr KP spittin truth for us
[2:23:22] anarkhali: they dont even see clearly
[2:23:47] masilllie: it‚Äôs just crazy to think teammates go to instead of being nice and making suggestions just to be toxic instead like?? what is wrong with you lmao. what a weird mind set
[2:23:48] CandyDust: happens to me all the time tho. people want to have beef about shit cause they feel that keeps them warm. its a jackass mentality and Im not here for it.
[2:23:59] sanemelody: passive aggressiveness also = toxicity :(
[2:24:01] ferriswheel8: @Oval819 lmao literally, its just a big group therapy with additional entertainment such as league
[2:24:11] kates_magates: i feel like people find security in the fact that they will never see them again because they feel like they can get away with being rude and not get caught. It's cyberbullying really
[2:24:15] kendren25: Failure is a personal shortvcoming
[2:24:22] Joshua4041010: Hi Kaypea, you are very cute!
[2:24:24] DLeiro: Hi Kaypea. question who gave the nerve and right to turn it this out?! Damn you look gorgeous. that hair, them eyes, the talent. ow wait i mean Freya, where is she? modcheck
[2:24:29] jimbob_ywert: The school system teaches that mindset, and it‚Äôs why most academically smart people only excel at academic-stuff
[2:24:47] Joshua4041010: Failing is part of our journey (Life)
[2:24:56] jingbajing: watching ur ahri vid as u play ahri
[2:25:02] Smoothcollie: Well take this. And apply this for their irl - how hard they will hit the wall, not wanting to fail and then rage into oblivion if they do kaypLUL
[2:25:24] Dumbmuto: @Smoothcollie plink
[2:25:25] beanythewhale31: Without fail there wouldn't be success <3
[2:25:31] aty212121: What's so cute bout her idk, she's strong
[2:25:31] LuckyToine: as an artist, you have to fail‚Ä¶ A LOT to get better at your art. this fact breaks so many people trying to be artists. it‚Äôs sad
[2:25:32] kates_magates: and that's why we gotta stay strong reporting ü´°ü´°
[2:25:47] slovenianbro: can someone explain why the map is hidden in jungle? Bcs of the stream snipers?
[2:26:04] Smoothcollie: @kates_magates kaypJanitor we gotta stay cleanin
[2:26:08] ferriswheel8: @slovenianbro Yeah exactly for that reason
[2:26:09] DLeiro: i just dissociate and let my inner gay come out and just become sassy
[2:26:09] masilllie: wish you could just pull up everything someones typed online for like interviews and stuff. bet they‚Äôll be a lot nicer then üíÄ
[2:26:13] kendren25: pretty much, slovenian bro
[2:26:18] watson1235: @slovenianbro yes
[2:26:29] Oval819: pop quiz of character
[2:26:32] jimbob_ywert: @luckytoine currently learning art and had to take a whole lesson about failing üò≠ bracing myself
[2:26:33] CanyonBiker8: Well said, KP. I totally agree with you
[2:26:37] Jun848: did u decide on a new emote yet?
[2:26:39] aside_sue: im off to the gym have  a great stream kels kaypLove kaypPengu
[2:26:47] slovenianbro: okay, it was weird for me why the whole map is not blocked than so i tought its something else
[2:26:50] Jusian: Hi Kp How are you <3
[2:26:51] aty212121: KP wins here 11 0 4
[2:26:52] slovenianbro: thanks for the info
[2:26:53] agentmilo1: When people get angry in life, for example, I'm angry with my boss and I can't show my anger to him, it remains in my subconscious mind and later I come to vent that anger more strongly on Olsen, the easiest person I can.
[2:26:55] ferriswheel8: @aside_sue have fun <3
[2:26:57] Oval819: missing a canon minion is a real test of character
[2:27:03] aside_sue: ty kaypPengu
[2:27:07] anarkhali: lmao @Oval819
[2:27:09] theenation97: have you been building lichbane on ahri?
[2:27:32] kendren25: This is, 20 years ago, I would have argued the exact opposite of what KP is saying. How I act in game has no bearing on who I am IRL. I've grow up a a bit now
[2:27:36] ferriswheel8: @Oval819 lmao fr
[2:27:41] davzrr: HeyGuys
[2:27:44] kates_magates: people just can never admit that they are wrong, and if that's the case in a game, then i'm scared to see how they live their actual lives
[2:28:01] Karimftw: heyo
[2:28:05] Karimftw: is it a coldplay kind of day today
[2:28:10] Azalien: Hey KP how r u <3
[2:28:15] TheAlexJames: it's a vibe playing lego Minecraft FM, listening to KP spit nothing but facts about life <3
[2:28:29] enigmakelz: first neeko i‚Äôve seen all season
[2:28:46] ferriswheel8: @kates_magates literally, i feel like admitting to being wrong is becoming an absolute rareness these days, which is honestly terrifying
[2:29:03] jimbob_ywert: People use gaming to cope with their sadness and leads to expressing their toxicness online.
[2:29:06] ieatthemforaliving: @enigmakelz NEEKO MAINS RISE. ( I main Neeko.
[2:29:17] ferriswheel8: @TheAlexJames hope you're having a great time <3
[2:29:18] sovitiaisavampire: thats still irrelvant, its obvious they are not enjoying the game if they feel like lashing out, just quit the game
[2:29:26] ieatthemforaliving: I want the baddest ChromaAAAAAAAAGH.
[2:29:32] Smoothcollie: But why those people go and queue into one of the most toxic games? Like where is logic behind this? If u are in a bad spot, go play some chill games. Please kaypAwkward
[2:29:37] Oval819: @ferriswheel8 does GG not mean gaslighting gamers?
[2:29:43] tofuex91: @enigmakelz i see her alot, she kinda strong rn
[2:29:44] Terhadalas: omg this song!!!
[2:29:52] ieatthemforaliving: @Smoothcollie R i g h t ?
[2:30:16] DLeiro: kaypea isn't always correct she's just right
[2:30:23] kates_magates: but coldplay is so chill
[2:30:31] TheAlexJames: of course, but your attitude towards life and toxicity is exemplary
[2:30:35] Terhadalas: dont you dare switch this song!! BibleThump BibleThump
[2:31:09] theenation97: @smoothcollie I think it‚Äôs because of the adrenaline you get from popping off in a game. if you‚Äôre sad / upset in real life, you may play league to feel that high of winning and ‚Äòbeing on top‚Äô
[2:31:19] Oval819: hearing this much coldplay in a row is a test of character Kappa
[2:31:28] Smoothcollie: Such a nice predict with the E
[2:31:47] kates_magates: i'm still in high school, so i've still got so much to learn, but i really do have kaypea to thank for teaching so many important lessons in life, and i'm forever grateful for that
[2:31:52] Karimftw: life is life

[2:34:19] GByte00: 10years .......... And how long have you been able to make a living from it?
[2:34:22] jimbob_ywert: I think the best emote would be something we would use a lot of the time. maybe a KP pic with a question mark on her head!
[2:34:36] TheAlexJames: Do disrupt the peaceful tranquility that is KP chat kaypRainbow
[2:34:37] lewhitehd69: @KayPea wat if we do a kaypPostmanPat emote and its you in the tiny postman pat car from the copenhagen vlog KEKL

[2:54:31] Darkcyter: @FlamboyantCraig kaypHello
[2:54:34] CynicalScrub: it sucks when you guys say people died when completely healthy, but after watching how miserable my grandparents were for their last 6-12 months, i think healthy deaths are a huge blessing in disguise
[2:54:47] FlamboyantCraig: like i can stay happy for a period of time but eventually kinda stops working
[2:54:47] Tehpirate1337: Morning Kp
[2:54:51] Zigmund_X: how are you finding the new season KP?
[2:54:52] FlamboyantCraig: @Darkcyter kaypPengu
[2:54:53] ferriswheel8: Yeah honestly, music does attach to certain moments, happy or sad, so whenever i listen to particular songs i basically relieve these moments
[2:54:59] anarkhali: sad boi hours
[2:55:11] TheAlexJames: we're all that way, deep down,. but people are so out of touch with their bodies and intuitions :/
