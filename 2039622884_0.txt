[5:25:01] karmelo_l: @J_a_k_e_54 bob doesnt build it because he dies right after he finishes it

[5:32:49] phorizzles: 2763 missed cannons in 2023 bobby lets go for 3k in 2024! :)
[5:33:41] leamfor: @onestepstroke Happens every game when you're not turbo killing everything on the map, and even then it might happen someone perceives that you didn't do the right map movement
[5:33:43] phorizzles: @onestepstroke just become the IGL, god knows someone has to coach the team
[5:33:59] hoowoo502: classic display of league ehh
[5:34:35] phorizzles: bobbys hackin

[5:35:08] tngermainee: thatâ€™s a preview of late game senna lol
[5:36:32] leamfor: @leamfor For example, if I kill your lane opponent and get the wave in, but you don't come to the grubs/herald/drake, then that is pretty tilting.
[5:38:19] leamfor: @onestepstroke It's not even like they're scratching my back, it's scratching their backs and everyone on the team's backs.
[5:38:39] tngermainee: and victor and senna

[5:47:04] AirTotten: yo why are people building LB AD over AP? I need knowledge
[5:47:53] shaneaceg: i tell supports everyday their opinions dont matter and that they shouldnt even be allowed to ff
[5:48:02] Voldex: new items probably still better, squal is ridicilous still
[5:48:06] leamfor: Support, the only role where if the mains went to another role they would be 1.5 divisions below where they are at.
[5:48:25] tngermainee: @leamfor sure buddy
[5:49:11] Voldex: thats actually true tho, you can only be as bad as the next support
[5:49:34] Dougs05: 15%??
[5:49:37] Dougs05: yeaah
[5:49:51] tngermainee: @voldex sure buddy you know most sup players am sure you have the research to back up that wild statement
[5:50:32] leamfor: @tngermainee If I ever get the funding, I absolutely will try to run a study.
[5:51:25] Voldex: @tngermainee just personal exp, ppl in mid elo (d1-to master) usually have no macro on support
[5:51:49] Voldex: they just roam to mid and thats it
[5:51:51] leamfor: WINNABLE
[5:51:54] shaneaceg: 40%
[5:51:56] Dougs05: 25%%%%%

[5:53:41] leamfor: Damn, lose the game before champ select lmao
[5:53:44] yoishim: what is this jg gap
[5:54:00] tngermainee: @voldex go play the role and get free wins itâ€™s easy right and see the brain dead plays jug and adc make every game
[5:54:15] leamfor: and they have heals
[5:55:04] setsunaravers: no show meat

[5:55:15] Hellhound298: idk why we sat for another 15 minujtes tho
[5:55:36] Voldex: @tngermainee  an adc dies so easily these seasons, i think ur hardstuck and just making an argument to defend your role
[5:55:51] Voldex: @tngermainee dont tell this to the lulu main tho with a 100% wr oin rengo
[5:56:01] slaughter78788: Your riven lost to kayle level one
[5:56:08] tngermainee: @voldex you donâ€™t know shit about me
[5:56:11] leblvnt: isnt ap leblanc better with the new items?
[5:56:17] tngermainee: but whatever makes you sleep at night to cope
[5:56:28] slaughter78788: I dont even play top and i know that kayle level 1 isnt to be fucked with
[5:56:38] leamfor: @tngermainee Whenever I do get filled support, or decide to queue up for it, I absolutely smurf it every time. It's easy.
[5:56:49] slaughter78788: she gets a ton of attack speed from her passive and just smacks you to death
[5:57:08] tngermainee: @leamfor wow amazing bro you should be rank one soon
[5:57:21] tngermainee: itâ€™s free wins after all
