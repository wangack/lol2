[0:25:46] SHINZOUTORI: hi tacooo! , is stormrazor still good with jhin? or is it situational?

[0:28:09] zaahzah: @Roof1x i mean the in lane money is crazy

[3:43:15] Jauneofarc: LMAOOOO
[3:43:26] kilicdar0glu_aday0lma: Worth
[3:43:29] Atelier_Kilikir: I doubt that, I bet it was just a mistake.
[3:43:33] LameKai: the herald does a 180 and goes the other way
[3:43:33] cherr0za: janna just doesnt know what winning feels like
[3:43:37] akz117: nah she didn't click twice , it's weird to use the herald
[3:43:44] mrpatx: Herald nug? you know the one in whiche the herald does a U tirn for no reason
[3:43:52] lener311: @cherr0za poor girly ._.
[3:43:55] HeckingLoveLeague: Yo vandril didnt make a video on this bug i think

[3:44:16] lener311: janna has a special place in our heart
[3:44:29] Ayycisco_: yes it is a bug
[3:44:42] LameKai: it has happened to me. i go in herald but it goes the other way it was facing
[3:44:48] wonderbread1108: i always had an issue starting the charge... im not sure if it starts in your mouse direction or what...
[3:44:52] Bo_sBurner: ngl stop hating on janna, your gameplay is literally pray to get carried xd no disrespect ofc
[3:45:03] wonderbread1108: very possibly
[3:45:07] shady_basement: ive seen it happen now and then with a jungler i watch
[3:45:18] akz117: It even happen in LEC
[3:45:18] cherr0za: @LameKai sometimes ittl hit the dead nexus turret things before i hit nexus
[3:45:20] shady_basement: its random and no one knows what causes it far as im aware
[3:45:20] starsinthevoids: @Bo_sBurner why the fuck wouldnt he want to get carried if he objectively knows he's not contributing and if he egos he'll lose
[3:45:23] Mcbensky: something similar with sions ult, you could turn it around
[3:45:23] Piemaster_7: no disrespect ofc
[3:45:39] lener311: just love for janna
[3:45:49] NomadNoah: Being carryable is a good skill hahaha
[3:45:54] Komlin111: nami

[3:47:36] ei_thief: Finally lets go time for the win streak
[3:47:59] Atelier_Kilikir: That Taliyah did a great job that game
[3:48:34] Komlin111: GAMING
[3:48:53] SaucedUpZae: is it normal to have mana issues like that with mf
[3:49:02] Kalideagarwaen: @SaucedUpZae yes
[3:49:19] Numbah214: @IKeepItTaco i feel like this season is proof that ranked should be disabled for the entire first patch
[3:49:23] ChiliboyN1: take clarity
[3:49:37] ironham357: DinoDance
[3:49:42] SaucedUpZae: i thought they increased the mana regen recently
[3:49:46] dracula_coffin: When do you play jinx
[3:50:07] Komlin111: @Numbah214 preseason was fake tho, you still lost/gained mmr and ppl thought they could for fun or troll
[3:50:14] Komlin111: comet mf is dead
[3:50:25] Atelier_Kilikir: I’m curious, why are you playing MF as a 2nd pick instead of Jinx or Ez?
[3:50:58] zathura6: so dont use ability really for farm?
[3:51:06] nexstwouin: mf is good vs zyra
[3:51:06] starsinthevoids: YOOO Transistor OST LET'S GO
[3:51:07] Numbah214: @Atelier_Kilikir jinx is dogshit, and i don't think he really likes ezreal
[3:51:09] Komlin111: the sheen changes feel weird
[3:51:16] Numbah214: ezreal is gonna be better next patch tho
[3:51:28] zathura6: ahhhh ok

[3:52:20] chipichipichapachapagr: in previous season it was in a popular build to go mananume with her assassin build
[3:52:22] TheLGNDRYSonny: Mf is jhin but booba
[3:52:26] Paczkusny: how about lucian? hes so op rn
[3:52:32] lener311: @Numbah214 crying as an jinx otp
[3:53:49] dracula_coffin: How do you use MF passive well
[3:53:54] Inxt1nct: like samira
[3:54:13] OGTRAYx: i feel like aphelios is soo good this patch too
[3:54:14] Komlin111: holy ezreal is 47% wr
[3:54:15] dardc: what adcs dont mind supps?
[3:54:19] akz117: riot sayin you should share xp in the loading screen ???
[3:54:29] Numbah214: @Numbah214 don't cry, lener. this is your opportunity to break free like i did
[3:54:35] Atelier_Kilikir: I get your point but Sona Lucian is a good botlane. She’s a good pick with him like Nami or Milio
[3:54:38] lener311: @Komlin111 get buffs next patch
[3:54:42] coreyelle: audoauodauodauoduaoudo
[3:54:46] Albriktsen9: how do i tell team mates to use brain when im chat banned?
[3:54:49] satty12345: is twitch support dependant as well? as I see lot of ppl smurfing with twitch
[3:54:49] Alice_bookie: @dardc sivir, MF, draven
[3:54:56] belallaj: can someone explain to me how does the double supp item bot work?
[3:55:44] Komlin111: well first you pick sona seraphine...
[3:56:21] AwesomeInABox: to conserve mf mana you have to just never use e/w unless its to get a good trade
[3:56:36] joeblondie: Senna again OMEGALUL
[3:56:55] o_pira: @belallaj start lane normally, adc gets sup item on first back and shares gold with support while not hurting his gold income
[3:57:04] SaucedUpZae: lol one trade 0 mana
[3:57:04] P4hagen: Why first strike over dark harvest?
[3:57:29] AwesomeInABox: first strike synergizes too well with mf kit
[3:57:29] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D
[3:57:51] bob_shwarman: good flash bait unfort no mid prio

[3:59:19] peshecito: D:
[3:59:21] HoleyShirt1: sensitive little baby talon awww
[3:59:33] belallaj: tragic
[3:59:50] joeblondie: lose roam as talon to katarina --> blame adc for that
[3:59:51] Nightbot: You really thought I could lose? You seriously think this game is lost and that I cant win? You have the IQ of a Janna main if you truly think I can be defeated.
[3:59:52] MrO_2134: why rotate tho?
[3:59:54] LobaaChe: assassin players
[3:59:55] bob_shwarman: classic mid gap about to gappen

[4:00:07] SaucedUpZae: i hear inbreds posses special abilities though, not all bad
[4:00:23] SuaveADC: adc feels so rough this season
[4:00:36] Numbah214: that's because it is
[4:00:45] HoleyShirt1: adc has been rough for a bit
[4:00:50] joeblondie: adc was rough since 2019
[4:00:50] MrO_2134: MF is broken atm
[4:00:57] Alice_bookie: @suaveadc when has it not been? LUL
[4:01:12] SaucedUpZae: i feel like adc is more rough in lower elo's where teams can't play from behind well
[4:01:16] SuaveADC: shes strong but she isn't 1v9, i felt like in s13 adc had more agency it feels more coin flippy than ever
[4:01:24] joeblondie: senna player xdd
[4:01:57] SaucedUpZae: "did i have it?" lol
[4:01:59] MrO_2134: tru that
[4:01:59] peshecito: NotLikeThis
[4:02:12] HoleyShirt1: i cant deal with dumb supports, much rather play top or mid lol, at least at mid i can roam and help the more likely than not struggling adc
[4:02:16] joeblondie: 0 roam talon catClap senna support classic
[4:02:37] chipichipichapachapagr: senna ResidentSleeper
[4:02:39] rookiebob: i thought senna is a carry?
[4:02:41] bob_shwarman: senna on my team vs enemy team classic
[4:03:57] OGTRAYx: a WHAT is fed??
[4:04:11] SaucedUpZae: might be able to bait her R by w'ing and pressing e instead, maybe her braincells will malfunction
[4:04:11] dardc: what champs doo you think aren't support reliant for adc?
[4:04:23] Chillabreh: @HoleyShirt1 so many games ive played that had dumb mids/tops throw the game
[4:04:48] LobaaChe: hotline miami soundtrack catJAM
[4:04:50] zizooboy: thats the most afk talon i see in a while
[4:04:51] SuaveADC: ezreal but he's rubbish this season @dardc
[4:04:57] HoleyShirt1: @Chillabreh very true lol, case in point, people just dont think macro and play as a team, case in point talon
[4:05:00] bob_shwarman: talon perma outroamed, too inidicative of late game classic Aware
[4:05:13] its_kuumo: @IKeepItTaco Thoughts on being behind on MF i still think you're useful. but when you're behind on Jhin i feel like you're completely useless
[4:05:15] dardc: @SuaveADC anyone else?
[4:05:26] Chillabreh: @HoleyShirt1 i agree
[4:05:31] SaucedUpZae: what do you mean they buffed his W cd tho xD that should make him overpowered xD POV: Riot employee
[4:05:33] belallaj: why no tear on mf?
[4:05:35] nexstwouin: @its_kuumo he just said this 2 min ago
[4:05:36] SuaveADC: lucian and vayne, honestly i would say all of them are support reliant but less so than completely immobile adcs with no self peel
[4:06:14] HoleyShirt1: @Chillabreh people get too emotional about events in game, its best to think whats objectively best for the team and a large amount of players are unable to do that
[4:06:58] zizooboy: talon KEKW
[4:07:02] Chillabreh: @HoleyShirt1 yea dude. it's common for people to give up 5 mins in and just afk farm the entire time. it's frustrating
[4:07:03] joeblondie: jungler taking canon+3 melee xdd
[4:07:12] R_a_n__: Even the jungle refused to follow his stupid play but he didn't even realize that

[4:08:35] SaucedUpZae: is he going to be AD or AP
[4:08:46] Numbah214: primarily AD/crit, it seems
[4:08:58] Chillabreh: isnt crit bad this season?
[4:09:07] Numbah214: but he's one of the weird ADC's who has AP ratios on most spells
[4:09:11] jaymoper: why flash so late
[4:09:14] Numbah214: @Chillabreh yep
[4:09:16] HoleyShirt1: TheVoices

[4:10:15] Mav465: ADC'S LIFE
[4:10:21] Chillabreh: @lener311 yea adcs got worse
[4:10:26] Numbah214: @IKeepItTaco i don't know how you can resist the urge to tell this talon to pick up annie.

[4:10:26] ahrimami: helloooo

[4:11:04] Tga_nick: i feel a lot less impactful as an adc

[4:11:51] babyhydra: how whiny is this talon jfc
[4:12:05] Numbah214: @IKeepItTaco almost every crit item got removed or nerfed across the board, navori and IE are still exclusive with each other, guinsoo's doesn't convert crit anymore, and terminus doesn't provide crit. tf are you talking about, ADC's didn't get nerfed?
[4:12:07] RurinNeedsCoffee: Is zyra jungle still w thing this season?
[4:12:13] Chillabreh: if anything just even looks at you as an adc, youre insta dead
[4:12:19] oldskateboard: talon just typing to himself no one cares about them
[4:12:28] Komlin111: it was talons fault for bad lane management?
[4:12:46] SuaveADC: they also removed galeforce :( @Numbah214
[4:12:52] lener311: Senna goes freakyyyyy
[4:12:58] R_a_n__: Doesn't seem like anyone else on the team is half decent really.

[4:13:47] miniPODz: Sivir just clear the waves and farm
[4:13:52] SuaveADC: samira or nilah imo, masters of butt slamming people on less than 10hp
[4:13:58] Angira92: Garen GIGACHAD
[4:14:04] Angira92: Like with Yuumi

[4:14:38] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D
[4:14:38] SaucedUpZae: kind of unrelated to the current match but how does one handle a udyr lol
[4:14:59] lener311: @Angira92 played against yuumi garen bot... it was insane boring
[4:15:21] Komlin111: healing and shield reduction

[4:16:09] Komlin111: ?!?
[4:16:21] bob_shwarman: classic mid gap
[4:16:30] R_a_n__: Honestly everyone in that team felt like they played with lock screen and without a minimap

[4:39:08] Mimidiggz: mid is braindead

[5:07:14] lener311: Jhin mid in euw is a thing
[5:07:27] dlgstriker: jhin mid na is a thing lol
[5:07:32] FACECHECKSKARNER: sundered sky with the free crit into full lethality thoughts taco?

[5:08:22] Dogvale: NA thinks if you are not playing meta youre trolling
[5:08:32] lener311: @Dogvale yesssss
[5:08:59] FACECHECKSKARNER: copypasta @IKeepItTaco
[5:09:01] TrueGrit0009: this season’s matchmaking is driving me insane. 50 games on John 45% win rate. I avg 10 kills 5 deaths, 7 assists a game in 50 games. hate this season so far.
[5:09:11] thelastbroke: when was the last patch?
[5:09:36] FACECHECKSKARNER: 10/10 gaslighting
[5:09:40] lener311: @Magicsan ye so sad

[5:11:08] Numbah214: @lener311 tbf, it was good in a hilarious way at some point.
[5:11:19] MyNameIsYako: For jhin mid is it better dar harvest or fleet footwork?
[5:11:32] Numbah214: @MyNameIsYako seems like dark harvest is the way to go for mid

[5:13:22] lener311: were pent on lvl 1 or no invade xd
[5:13:26] lener311: penta
[5:13:52] shimapanenjoyer: i think ur insane bro, last 3 seaons made me actually quit game few times, and this season i actually did it, i quit it and didn;t come back, my 26yrs old mental gave up, was fun counting to four while it lasted tho
[5:14:12] lener311: @shimapanenjoyer 🫂

[5:15:49] Heres666: might be just my last 2 games but seems like people are not liking jhin for whatever reason right now
[5:16:19] lener311: the trackkkk
[5:16:23] better_call_sion: RIOT
[5:16:26] lener311: i cryyyy
[5:16:27] Nightbot: BRO ITS MY FIRST TIME, IM PEAKING !!!
[5:16:45] CictorGabriel: great work nautilus
[5:16:50] ivriis: do you think sera bot is good in silver too?
[5:16:50] lener311: is double sup in na a thing?
[5:16:52] Dogvale: according to phreak, its elo inflation because "bot lane can not draft MR runes"
[5:16:59] lener311: @ivriis yes
[5:17:02] ChaosSmurf: naut has no flash I think
[5:17:11] antichamber122: Trinity force on jhin good or not in s14?
[5:17:15] ChaosSmurf: o
[5:17:16] ChaosSmurf: exdee
[5:17:18] better_call_sion: Life this song
[5:17:24] ReeshOdd: @Dogvale i dont know if this is a joke because he says weird shit all the time or serious
[5:17:27] lifeissadx: @antichamber122 what xd
[5:17:38] ivriis: @lener311 might try her with a duo
[5:17:40] shimapanenjoyer: @ivriis sera/naut or sera/swain bot is free elo in low leagues
[5:17:56] lener311: @shimapanenjoyer I mean double enchanter
[5:17:58] CictorGabriel: hes suing
[5:18:01] antichamber122: @lifeissadx I mean, it's a sheen item, some HP, ad + attack speed (basically AD too)
[5:18:15] ivriis: @shimapanenjoyer huh I'll try, thanks
[5:18:18] keelaykane: was wathcing august stream, said 50% take armour into sera below masters
[5:18:18] FACECHECKSKARNER: ya i wanted a greed gank to finish item
[5:18:21] FACECHECKSKARNER: was bad idea mb
[5:18:33] lifeissadx: @lifeissadx no its not a good item at all xd
[5:18:34] lener311: ouhhhh
[5:18:50] Dogvale: @ReeshOdd yeah he literally said he wanted to change the stat runes to HP and you cant choose resistances anymore, and it benefits botlane when the other team plays double mage and you dont pay attention and draft armor lol
[5:18:56] ReeshOdd: @keelaykane lol porofessor imported runes xd
[5:19:22] ChaosSmurf: just 2 more days of this double support shit
[5:19:29] ReeshOdd: @Dogvale but that does not address sera/sona infinite shield late game, did he speak about that?
[5:19:33] lener311: @ChaosSmurf thank god
[5:19:37] better_call_sion: seraphine sona is hideous
[5:19:46] lener311: I need the classic botlane back
[5:19:49] Lparizzi: Ia Tryind meta now???
[5:19:56] Lparizzi: Is*
[5:20:03] Dogvale: @ReeshOdd nope! i agree with taco, her waveclear makes it so you skip laning phase interactions all together
[5:20:16] Dogvale: plus lategame seraphine is so good
[5:20:17] better_call_sion: millio is really good right now too
[5:20:23] falendalle: @Lparizzi trynda is in a bad state atm
[5:20:25] keelaykane: do you think the rune changes to health instead of resistances will help against apc's?
[5:20:26] lener311: my sera sup climbed without me... as an apt..
[5:20:29] vsmilotic: is it just me or u should not belvie what phreak said too much LUL
[5:20:31] ChaosSmurf: seraphine millio sounds like a lane that would make me kill myself
[5:20:32] ivriis: but if you build the supp items you gain less gold from minions?
[5:20:32] lener311: apc
[5:21:08] MarkShizzle: Hey Taco!
[5:21:14] jaymoper: I thought u were almost masters day 2  how r u hard stuck here
[5:21:15] LilyJade1120: I love this song
[5:21:15] ivriis: sorry for the stupid questions but I wanna try her and understand how to play her better
[5:21:26] shimapanenjoyer: @lener311 depends on ur team, if u have some hyper carry mid/jungle u cna go for it, but with double enchanters u will be reliant on someone else to carry, and usually ur "carry" is simply bad in low elo. Double enchanters bot  works only if u have strong solo carry pick in team, or one of u specs into it (lulu can)\
[5:21:56] lener311: @shimapanenjoyer thank u for the long answer
[5:21:57] shimapanenjoyer: the reason for sera/swain or sera/naut is that u can carry the game as only 2 of you
[5:22:00] Komlin111: second shot Yepge
[5:22:04] MarkShizzle: How u doing? @IKeepItTaco
[5:22:18] FACECHECKSKARNER: who needs oracle lens when u have intuition

[5:23:13] peshecito: KEKW
[5:23:14] CictorGabriel: hes talking about taht terraria item
[5:23:47] ivriis: but if you build the supp items on sera apc you gain less gold from minions?
[5:23:47] scootrTTV: five?
[5:23:51] antichamber122: should've never said five!
[5:23:53] skylone2: xD

[5:24:01] Komlin111: five is right out!
[5:24:02] xtrove: shoulda just said 4 again
[5:24:03] Brosephu_Brostar: Jhin can't count that far

[5:30:23] antichamber122: All you need in life right now is 1 assist
[5:30:35] SnowballBarrage: yone is difficult to play
[5:30:37] MarkShizzle: Yone gameplay KEKW
[5:30:39] antichamber122: Not anymore
[5:30:43] MimiBonnyBun: Yone KEKW
[5:30:55] ReeshOdd: E 2 minute cooldown when?
[5:30:58] Komlin111: I will play vs yone zero times this season
[5:31:09] SnowballBarrage: im alright i woke up an hour ago so im eating pasta for breakfast soon
[5:31:11] elithewick3d: balanced gameplay from yone would recomend 10/10
[5:31:13] MarkShizzle: "ADC players are bad, look at me im yone im good" peepoClown
[5:31:31] better_call_sion: Guys Yone was released in 2020 i think right? Aware no matter how many times i see him do that shit I call bs
[5:31:35] sebastian1997: 7 kill your with two towers of gold and farm… yeah that is really bad
[5:31:40] Komlin111: just delete letal tempo already
[5:31:49] sebastian1997: yone *
[5:31:57] shimapanenjoyer: to be fair yone isn't that easy, they just fed him. Yone is actually really easy to shut down early game
[5:32:00] MarkShizzle: @Komlin111 you've spelled yone wrong KEKW
[5:32:21] ReeshOdd: @shimapanenjoyer the E no cap on distance still so annoying tho >:c
[5:32:21] Komlin111: no yone is brainless
[5:32:41] lener311: @yoboyshooter like yas
[5:32:47] MarkShizzle: sure he is fed, but yone as a champion is not difficult
[5:32:51] LilyJade1120: RIOT
[5:32:53] ReeshOdd: like look at that movement, it is so annoying lol
[5:33:02] Ao0zne: that was way too close lmao
[5:33:08] ivriis: @yoboyshooter evelynn is disgusting this season
[5:33:18] MarkShizzle: Yone is like Irelia, one or two items and they can 1vs9
[5:33:31] ReeshOdd: @ivriis i havent seen any evenlynns im scared
[5:33:48] lener311: @yoboyshooter yas is an insta report
[5:34:00] NomadNoah: I think people like to imagine the early game as relatively low-stakes, even though that's super not correct
[5:34:00] CictorGabriel: no way kindred ult saved him
[5:34:00] SnowballBarrage: kindred has so many stacks hoooly
[5:34:06] sebastian1997: yone is a really good kid and late game. if one make sure they fall behind early they aren’t to unkillable. that and yone players tend to have a protagonist syndrome and tend to loose their shit if they don’t feel like they win
[5:34:07] Komlin111: I think missing qs and using ult as a gapcloser is broken if he can just kill in 4-5 autos
[5:34:14] better_call_sion: ok he is fed but he could do that shit even if he wasnt. he would have to auto a few more times maybe lol
[5:34:25] ivriis: @ReeshOdd lucky you, today I ran into an evelynn, she was so behind but she was carrying the game
[5:34:44] alterkita: too be fair any champion in the game whose giga fed and snowballed is broken
[5:34:58] Komlin111: just his play patterns are not ok
[5:35:04] vandrelan: vandrelan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hello Taco, have we escaped hell or is the escape still in progress?
[5:35:25] Komlin111: yone ekko kayn I would consider the unskilled assassins
[5:35:32] better_call_sion: yone mid is fine but yone top is very very annoying
[5:35:48] ReeshOdd: @Komlin111 REPLAY

[5:55:12] shimapanenjoyer: @narp40rex for them to get money u have to put some money in. channel points don't cost u any money so they get no money for u spending them

[5:59:39] lolsenses: its horrid for viktor lol
[5:59:48] manasar: You need some sort of distance creator against galio, like syndra E
[5:59:52] GnawMe: just play safe galio

[6:05:37] xOoren: Not only the pick Viktor seems horrible but to be fair, there were also a lot of mistakes around Galio engage range wich gave him plenty of easy trade, sometimes just to take a caster or a ward

[6:17:27] better_call_sion: @Chrom_Kitsune getting carried is unironically a skill

[6:21:34] MegaMoeka: if you're going ap against a galio it needs to be like kassadin or someone with quick roots
[6:21:37] shadowm0narch: Wait what an mage is useless against Galion wtf
[6:21:39] XIII_Member: Dude
[6:21:45] XIII_Member: Sadge

[6:22:00] lil_pocket_egirl: how come taco is playing mid? instead of adc
[6:22:10] Ganeki26: but that was only 7 games
[6:22:24] FACECHECKSKARNER: @IKeepItTaco do u want a ban from me btw
[6:22:27] antichamber122: @lil_pocket_egirl It's more of a solo skill lane, in adc you have less room for mistakes since your support could be really bad...
[6:22:28] FACECHECKSKARNER: i been banning lilia
[6:22:29] MissSpicyTaco: lessgo viktor again xD
[6:22:30] better_call_sion: i dont why but seeing that galio lose didnt feel quite right. i mean the gold difference was probably big... your team turned it around i guess
[6:22:30] The_4tlas: I laughed hard with that "cringe galio"
[6:22:30] XIII_Member: You looked like an average game for me
[6:22:33] maw_of_malmortius: @IKeepItTaco may I ask why did skarner had a protobelt last game?

[6:24:26] fevgatos_live: No 2nd tree precision???
[6:24:39] Squishy9443: S14 Fast Jhin Build?
[6:24:57] Ao0zne: yeah that was playable, but the new RM items are so broken, Galio is really much more advantaged because of them
[6:25:07] XIII_Member: I saw a custom skin once, it was a fusion between Jhin and Fizz. Don't believe me? Google search Jhizz
[6:25:08] FACECHECKSKARNER: @IKeepItTaco  you are solo ad
[6:25:08] LyingLife: best jhin skin?
[6:25:19] better_call_sion: @Squishy9443 I tried to replicate the fast jhin build but it does not seem to work anymore

[6:33:44] XIII_Member: At least it isn't Barrier. As a midlane main, I hate when "people", specially ranged, run it
[6:34:25] Ninawai: sublime
[6:34:25] its_sonara: never saw it coming
[6:34:29] kasdrono: @Chrom_Kitsune and that EXACTLY is why I run it every game baby
[6:34:31] XIII_Member: If the Barrier has 1 million haters, I'm one of them. If the Barrier has no haters, I died. Nerf that summ to the ground
[6:34:42] mcegginton: Skarner killed sona KEKW
[6:34:53] fevgatos_live: FOURRRRRR

[6:35:16] XIII_Member: All roads lead to botlane
[6:35:17] laikanangel: Big Poggies TM
[6:35:17] its_sonara: velkozing
[6:35:22] mcegginton: He literally just ran it down
[6:35:23] SailorPluto9: DIAMOND gameplay
[6:35:26] maw_of_malmortius: velkoz gaming

[6:35:41] NapNapoleon: This is going well god DAMN
[6:35:53] MimiBonnyBun: Mao got real emotional there

[6:35:58] fevgatos_live: he only wants to hug u chain u
[6:36:01] mcegginton: I do itsOK

[6:37:40] blackobelisk1337: XD?
[6:37:41] XIII_Member: So sad
[6:37:45] XIII_Member: Even a Nobody May Cry
[6:37:48] its_sonara: PREDATOR?
[6:37:49] PRISMOH: LUL
[6:37:51] mcegginton: your flash bwo?
[6:38:02] XIII_Member: Flash for the next game
[6:38:15] AwesomeInABox: if its the supports fault its actually "bots" fault. they will say something like 1/10 bot when you are 1/3 and your support is sprinting it
[6:38:15] fevgatos_live: this is bad
[6:38:18] better_call_sion: A funny trick I did with jhin mid and skarner jungle was to stack a lot of traps in a place and bait people near them for skarner to drag over. satisfying oneshots. extra points for ap jhin
[6:38:19] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[6:38:24] XIII_Member: Skarner died as he lived
[6:38:30] Ninawai: bro kissed him
[6:38:45] XIII_Member: Running young, wild, and free
[6:38:46] NapNapoleon: The play leading into double kill for sylas. KEKW
[6:39:04] fevgatos_live: FOURRRRR
[6:39:06] NapNapoleon: Thankfully, sylas is not fast at running
[6:39:12] The6357Chris: NICSUH
[6:39:17] blackobelisk1337: BIG
[6:39:19] MimiBonnyBun: Hubris game PauseChamp ?
[6:39:26] XIII_Member: SKARNER GAMING IS YOUNG, WILD AND FREE I'VE SAID
[6:39:34] fevgatos_live: the disrespect xD
[6:39:41] mcegginton: Skarner is actually cool af I hope the rework turns out well for him
[6:39:56] SirAdayr: 0/10 viktor but 7-1 jhin, the duality of man
[6:40:18] XIII_Member: Imo, Veigar needs a rework as well. Like, if they keep overbuffing him, he'll become a problem for the game lol
[6:40:21] Ninawai: that's crazy
[6:40:22] The6357Chris: he got em ageeen
[6:41:25] XIII_Member: TFT Sona: With me, your board will reach it's maximum strenght
[6:41:28] XIII_Member: League Sona:
[6:41:39] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[6:41:44] ZephylonBoi: Yep she's going the tank thingy against one shot I think
[6:41:50] XIII_Member: Oh yeah, the Bloodsong thingy
[6:42:05] XIII_Member: It's kinda op rn, they'll nerf that next patch
[6:42:10] ZephylonBoi: Prob not, otherwise she wouldn't play bork
[6:42:12] Numbah214: oh yeah, that's the cheese ADC meta
[6:42:30] imHLP: i will never forget that sub you gifted me 3 years ago
[6:42:31] guinsou: @ikeepittaco yo taco why is everyone building sup item is it any good ?
[6:42:32] Ninawai: ive had a vayne go the supp item and with the upgrade that makes you do more dmg after using an ability she one shot people
[6:42:33] MimiBonnyBun: Moving... it's a wonderful dream Sadge
[6:42:38] XIII_Member: We did a custom game of 5, and all 5 running Support item
[6:42:49] XIII_Member: That's kinda not balanced rn LUL
[6:42:54] ZephylonBoi: @Ninawai yeah but not with brk, it's youmu build
[6:42:57] SirAdayr: is hubris dropped from the build
[6:43:04] laikanangel: TeamTrees jumpscare
[6:43:09] XIII_Member: I still wonder
[6:43:21] Ninawai: @Ninawai that's right, it was full let
[6:43:39] XIII_Member: Why can't they just give an AD Mejai's instead of doing mental gymnastics to give an item with scaling AD per kill
[6:43:43] ZephylonBoi: @Ninawai I'd prob go with the tank shield if I was going as
[6:43:56] XIII_Member: Like, Hubris is Mejai, but instead of losing the charges by death, you lose them by time
[6:44:19] XIII_Member: S13 Rav Hydra was Mejai but minion kills counted
[6:44:29] XIII_Member: Just make a freaking normal AD Mejais
[6:44:30] ZephylonBoi: @Chrom_Kitsune It was called sword of the occult and was removed because it was not balanced on assassins
[6:44:50] DwithD: i really want to say what was its when you siad about vatne sup item again?
[6:44:51] XIII_Member: @ZephylonBoi Nowadays, is there anything even remotely balanced?
[6:45:08] ZephylonBoi: @Chrom_Kitsune I'd say antiheal items are balanced,
[6:45:15] ZephylonBoi: lmao
[6:45:20] XIII_Member: Add that stuff back
[6:45:25] better_call_sion: @ZephylonBoi skarner is balanced! I think...
[6:45:31] XIII_Member: The Sword of the Occult I mean
[6:45:44] ZephylonBoi: sword of the occult was removed before jhin appearance btw, I think you know why
[6:45:48] XIII_Member: @ZephylonBoi Balanced to suck LUL
[6:45:58] gbhflex: Mordekaiser is balanced i am otp and hes useless like 70% of games so i'd call that balanced forsenDespair
[6:46:23] XIII_Member: Chat
[6:46:26] XIII_Member: Is Yone balanced?
[6:46:26] ZephylonBoi: If I remember back in the days, it was because assassins had means to escape while mages didn't, so they kept mejai but not the sword
[6:46:31] Ninawai: 20 mins no jgl item
[6:46:31] better_call_sion: nope
[6:46:41] ZephylonBoi: @Chrom_Kitsune nope
[6:46:45] RadiantWisp: whut
[6:46:49] gbhflex: yone is really annoying
[6:46:58] XIII_Member: Valid answers
[6:47:13] better_call_sion: an assassin-dps crit hybrid with mixed damage
[6:47:20] XIII_Member: One to cut, one to seal after all
[6:47:28] Ninawai: had he not 30 dashes shield and true dmg maybe
[6:47:37] gbhflex: Olaf/Jax/Fiora are my biggest nightmares as a morde otp
[6:47:37] RadiantWisp: rip
[6:47:40] ZephylonBoi: yone can build anything and beat anything depending on situation, that's what make it unfair
[6:47:41] XIII_Member: @Ninawai The True Damage is post mitigation
[6:47:48] XIII_Member: So it's not actual true damage
[6:48:02] XIII_Member: But all the other points are fair
[6:48:17] The_4tlas: kayn with one item can still one shot you easy
[6:48:26] XIII_Member: Like, two crit items for 100% so you could even go full tank is pretty stupid
[6:48:30] XIII_Member: @The_4tlas Yeah
[6:48:42] ZephylonBoi: thank god he's a little bit nerfed with mythics gone
[6:48:57] XIII_Member: I was playing Yone once, 100% Crit, like 300 armor, and a Kayn just one tapped me LUL
[6:49:19] XIII_Member: I was experimenting with the new items lol
[6:49:19] gbhflex: i wish yasuo got more love, hes always dogwater in meta i feel bad for otp yasuos
[6:49:22] better_call_sion: My change for yone would be to remove recast from e
[6:49:29] XIII_Member: So0
[6:49:30] gbhflex: yone is just statistically better
[6:49:32] XIII_Member: Just a dash
[6:49:46] Ninawai: god that cs'ing is so clean
[6:49:48] Tawrus_: I wish Yone got as much love as Yasuo :^)
[6:49:48] better_call_sion: yone e is used to dodge cc way too freely
[6:49:57] better_call_sion: unstoppable bs
[6:50:01] XIII_Member: @better_call_sion Just a dash or that the Yone HAS to go back after the 5 seconds, not before?
[6:50:12] Ninawai: HIS NAME
[6:50:17] ZephylonBoi: Make it so he's not unstoppable on buffing e and he would counterable at least
[6:50:22] better_call_sion: not being able to go back only be forced back
[6:50:26] howtoviana: me when flash 4 short did a flash 4 shot
[6:50:29] Guilbest: !opgg
[6:50:29] XIII_Member: I wish people stopped comparing Yone and Yasuo
[6:50:29] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[6:50:34] XIII_Member: @better_call_sion Fair enough
[6:50:44] NapNapoleon: Flash 4th shot.
[6:50:56] XIII_Member: I'd actually like if they changed E so it was decaying movement speed instead of ramping movement speed
[6:51:05] Ninawai: is it easier to carry as a midlaner or as an adc (let's say the supp is useful)
[6:51:19] gbhflex: i wish yone ult if missed that it didnt give you a massive gap closer anyways
[6:51:28] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[6:51:28] XIII_Member: I mean
[6:51:32] fevgatos_live: if he miss smite we never duo with him again
[6:52:08] XIII_Member: @gbhflex It's an anime move where he goes Zoro, what would you want to happen? For him to just stay there? Like, he just shoot a rectangle out of his swords lol
[6:52:15] RadiantWisp: <#
[6:52:18] fevgatos_live: mundo lookin thicc
[6:52:34] Djstark7: they have a mundo?
[6:52:51] XIII_Member: Also, it's weird how Yone is the only dual wielder in League. Like, everyone likes dual wielding, how is he the only one that can do it?
[6:53:13] mcegginton: @Chrom_Kitsune katarina has two knives
[6:53:15] NapNapoleon: Because he's the edgiest.
[6:53:15] better_call_sion: @Chrom_Kitsune Lucian counts?
[6:53:17] mcegginton: mf uses two guns
[6:53:27] XIII_Member: Dual Wielding actual swords I meant lol
[6:53:35] gbhflex: @chrom_kitsune i mean my experience into yone being a morde otp, he misses like 3 Q's, i avoid his ult but because i cant sidestep auto attacks he just buttplugs me anyways
[6:53:39] Ninawai: @Chrom_Kitsune olaf has two axes
[6:53:41] mcegginton: @Chrom_Kitsune Kayle
[6:53:42] XIII_Member: Because K'Sante would be a dual wielder too, and we all hate him
[6:53:48] XChaoLanX: @better_call_sion olaf has two axes
[6:53:54] datt808: Solo'd the drake while they fought KEKW
[6:53:56] XIII_Member: @mcegginton Oh yeah
[6:53:58] XIII_Member: She exists
[6:54:08] XIII_Member: Forgot whay I said lol
[6:54:11] better_call_sion: with so many champs you get lost sometimes
[6:54:17] better_call_sion: ok
[6:54:24] mcegginton: loseable
[6:54:39] XIII_Member: The best thing about Yone is that one Roxas Custom Skin GlitchCat
[6:54:48] Ninawai: oh my god mundo
[6:54:51] XIII_Member: As a weird australian once said
[6:54:56] XIII_Member: Is this game winnable?
[6:54:59] XChaoLanX: akali has two daggers
[6:55:07] Ninawai: @XChaoLanX knifes and kunais
[6:55:09] XChaoLanX: draven has two axes
[6:55:10] better_call_sion: @Chrom_Kitsune and then my tp support zilean died
[6:55:14] ZephylonBoi: By the way everyone talking about yone but did you know k sante was still meta in pro EVEN AFTER all these nerfs
[6:55:16] XIII_Member: @XChaoLanX Actually, five kunai and one kama
[6:55:21] gbhflex: big mace is better forsenSmug
[6:55:22] sariusookami: Hmm what i find far weirder is that there isnt really a champ with sword and shield
[6:55:23] Ninawai: @Chrom_Kitsune god what an amazing video
[6:55:30] mcegginton: sylas has two chains
[6:55:32] XIII_Member: @sariusookami Leona
[6:55:46] XChaoLanX: mf has two pistols
[6:55:57] fevgatos_live: lol that vayne....
[6:55:58] XIII_Member: I still read mf as motherfcker
[6:55:59] ZephylonBoi: mf is doing american gameplay
[6:56:00] gbhflex: mf has 4 guns
[6:56:03] fevgatos_live: she didnt know what got her
[6:56:05] sariusookami: @sariusookami oh ye, i forgor she existed for a second kek
[6:56:15] XChaoLanX: samira has a sword and a gun
[6:56:16] XIII_Member: @sariusookami Like I did with Kayle LUL
[6:56:17] deathklok_: @Chrom_Kitsune same
[6:56:19] Neitiznut: that skarner seems goo
[6:56:23] MrO_2134: is there a leth to ie build ?
[6:56:28] mcegginton: Heard a caster say Thresh is just Renata but worse, is this true chat
[6:56:30] Ninawai: @sariusookami does pantheon count? he's got a spear
[6:56:39] blaz1n_ace: old pantheon had a spear and a shield - close enough
[6:56:42] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[6:56:54] XChaoLanX: and that's pretty much it for all dual wielders in league
[6:56:57] fevgatos_live: mundo penta kill less go
[6:56:57] sariusookami: @sariusookami i would think so
[6:56:59] XChaoLanX: maybe zed as well
[6:57:00] gbhflex: current panth still has a spear and a shield tho
[6:57:09] TheFlamingTiger357: honestly just goes to show how aggro jhin can be
[6:57:14] XChaoLanX: or vi
[6:57:15] gbhflex: his E literally blocks stuff
[6:57:15] XIII_Member: gg
[6:57:21] FACECHECKSKARNER: amazing game
[6:57:22] TheFlamingTiger357: i wouldnt even think to ult maokai there
[6:57:25] blaz1n_ace: cant picutre the shield in my head rn lol
[6:57:26] dae6216: why do you kind of sound like Dantes
[6:57:36] gbhflex: its a small shield
[6:57:42] mcegginton: @dae6216 SCHIZO
[6:57:45] Krowely_: I still build Stormrazer first. I just feels too good to have the movement speed boost and some bonus magic dmg
[6:57:48] XChaoLanX: @dae6216 sounds nothing like him at all 🤔
[6:57:51] StealthyCiferr: @IKeepItTaco I really like Opportunity int wither hubris or Ghost blade depending on if Im ahead
[6:57:52] gbhflex: but he has an emote where he taps it with the spear
[6:57:53] mcegginton: Taco has a very distinctive voice imo
[6:57:54] ZephylonBoi: wait, you have negative winrate with that clean gameplay, holy unlucky
[6:57:54] better_call_sion: @dae6216 cant unhear it now
[6:58:01] sharkarao: why did collector do 8888?
[6:58:07] dae6216: lol my b chat
[6:58:07] b0nelesswat3r21: i dont think you sound like dantes
[6:58:18] YxngN4: why is he going mid chat?
[6:58:24] gbhflex: @ikeepittaco what do you think about morde currently forsenThink
[6:58:25] s_logan_s: Hi
[6:58:27] Krowely_: dantes is batshit insane. Actual asylum seeker
[6:58:28] blaz1n_ace: @gbhflex at least his spear is big
[6:58:46] better_call_sion: he actually does kinda sound like him
[6:58:49] topi1337: !opgg
[6:58:51] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[6:58:57] better_call_sion: maybe just me
[6:59:00] sariusookami: @sharkarao collector on jhin deals 4444 dmg and on crit execute 8888 i think
[6:59:02] b0nelesswat3r21: @Krowely_ yeah but hes funny
[6:59:11] mcegginton: You guys are onto nothing he doesn't sound like dantes at all
[6:59:13] gbhflex: @blaz1n_ace it better be big because it hits like a truck hahah
[6:59:15] s_logan_s: U win those yeee gj
[6:59:16] XChaoLanX: @sharkarao it's kind of weird. Sometimes it's because two damage sources overlay but sometimes it's just from a single instance of damage. Happens on champs other than Jhin as well where they do 1998 damage instead of 999.
[6:59:17] Krowely_: @Krowely_ yeah, coz loud = funny aye? yeah.
[6:59:23] Ninawai: those are some very nice words
[6:59:24] ltcskill: @IKeepItTaco come to EU, we appreciate mid jhin
[6:59:26] XIII_Member: Well, I gotta go to bed. So, good night guys, glad to make some discourse in chat lol
[6:59:30] sharkarao: @sariusookami that’s pretty cool, thank you
[6:59:32] lv100_umbreon: Is that the E ult auto refresh e cd auto ability haste skar?
[6:59:32] XIII_Member: Goodnight Taco and Skarner Gaming
[6:59:38] FACECHECKSKARNER: @Chrom_Kitsune gngn
[6:59:41] lv100_umbreon: Thats a solid skar build
[7:00:01] FACECHECKSKARNER: @lv100_umbreon no its mosquito build
[7:00:11] cetti: cetti subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! sup sexy? Came back to enjoy some more mighty Jhin content. Been on my Silver Jhin grind, its been well
[7:00:28] lv100_umbreon: Ohhh I see ill check that out thanks
[7:00:48] FACECHECKSKARNER: @lv100_umbreon check my twitter/reddit for explanation
[7:01:02] browy_eu: On euw people pick the most outlandish shit ant still not getting flamed
[7:01:06] XChaoLanX: everyone on reddit cried about jhin being useless in the G2 vs TH post game thread though Thinkge
[7:01:14] Ninawai: i love jhin but i hate adc
[7:01:32] topi1337: @browy_eu u must be low elo then, because that doesent happen
[7:01:32] lv100_umbreon: @facecheckskarner thanks fam
[7:01:36] cetti: Do you recommend fleet or dark harvest for lower elo?
[7:01:42] better_call_sion: @XChaoLanX you can add literally everything after the word about and it could make sense somehow
[7:01:55] bundy__wolf: Why Doran's blade of boots at start
[7:02:02] rratirl: @ninawai jhin is a support champ PepeLaugh
[7:02:13] forestwalkker: Eune super server )
[7:02:17] KayXOTV: What support is best for jhin
[7:02:22] Krowely_: @forestwalkker it's barely a server
[7:02:25] Ninawai: @tacendaz funniest shit was when it was famous
[7:02:55] Dogvale: didnt pots also get nerfed a while back?
[7:03:09] mcegginton: @XChaoLanX FLY used jhin really well though
[7:03:18] enriquemunozonline: someone knows when acc transfers will be available?
[7:03:32] cetti: I just watched a Jhin support video of yours where the akali kept trying to dive you and they were not liking that
[7:03:55] Numbah214: @IKeepItTaco ashe support is because she has CC
[7:04:04] XChaoLanX: funnily enough there was only a single comment that perfectly analysed why the Jhin pick sucked. They did nothing bot with him.
[7:04:14] AyaFreyja: who do you ban as adc?
[7:04:32] Ninawai: what do you guys think of this season having 3 splits?
[7:04:53] reaper_of_aspects: yo taco hows it going
[7:05:14] reaper_of_aspects: the games going better than yesterday?
[7:05:16] KayXOTV: What supports do you love having as jhin bot
[7:05:19] FACECHECKSKARNER: except if its 5 ap comp, thats just beg lose
[7:05:29] The_4tlas: @AyaFreyja draven, tristana
[7:05:37] fevgatos_live: decline
[7:05:39] shadowfax100: whenever u pop up i feel like i havent watched u in ages, hope u doing well man
[7:05:40] fevgatos_live: they will ban jhin
[7:06:46] Noeliosis: catsittingverycomfortablearoundacampfirewithitsfriends
[7:07:15] m1cdean19: Is hubris a good item on jhin? If so should I rush it or built 2nd?
[7:07:33] mcegginton: Again, FLY used him really well
[7:07:37] reaper_of_aspects: AAAA
[7:07:41] m1cdean19: Thanks
[7:07:44] reaper_of_aspects: ez another 4 wins
[7:07:45] XChaoLanX: I've been trying to get this one of mine to understand that but he just blindly hates Jhin because "he has to reload so he does no damage Pepega "
[7:07:45] shadowfax100: crit jhin feeling much better than lethality build for some reason
[7:07:49] m1cdean19: So hubris > collector?
[7:09:25] FACECHECKSKARNER: ur filled adc @IKeepItTaco
[7:09:27] XChaoLanX: it's legit the same thing every time a team picks Jhin where the adc clearly doesnt play him. They are always playing ultra safe and using ult from 5 screens away
[7:10:16] emmanouelxd: did they win the jhin
[7:10:38] m1cdean19: Thanks!
[7:10:58] Ninawai: why is garen as favorite adc
[7:10:58] DwithD: when i play sup when i hear ad ask what i am playing I will assume ad is bad so i pick soraka
[7:11:12] DwithD: -x-
[7:11:27] shadowfax100: is it jst me or does crit fleet build feel better than lethality?

[7:12:12] mcegginton: There was a fight in this game where all 4 members of IMT tried to bodyblock Jhin R for olleh and it still hit him

[7:25:46] TheFlamingTiger357: plus w make auto q auto faster
[7:26:18] XChaoLanX: E max doesnt give you more slow anymore since they changed it scale off of ap and to stay the same at all ranks
[7:26:18] fevgatos_live: E + R moment letsgoooo
