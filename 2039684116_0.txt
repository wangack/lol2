[3:26:39] abir_bot: watch kat 1 v 9
[3:26:40] Paviii: btw how come he has 3.5k viewers while taylor hits like 10k+ being so toxic
[3:26:45] SigmaZ_: why you don't get e second? so you can kill and run away quickly
[3:26:49] mttan97: oh man 20-12 to 27-27

[3:27:26] 67se: @Paviii taylor thinks hes a badboy with those that watch them, so
[3:27:26] coachphillipp: xd
[3:28:03] Paviii: @ViziManoY_Y hes best 1v1 midgame, but he lacks like global impact in the game, thats why you rather see seju or xin in LEC
[3:28:23] SigmaZ_: well you're really squishy

[3:29:28] aneru7: why sterak's over maw?
[3:29:28] OzymandiasTheGreatII: my brother in christ we need that 8 cs/min
