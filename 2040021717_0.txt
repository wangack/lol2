[0:48:15] triton8484: it's pretty clear from the gameplay
[0:48:29] Allerion_SE: I might just be spewing shit, but isn't it because Riot wants to enforce standard deviation on ranked for some reason?

[1:37:10] KingParanha: kayle jg op?
[1:37:41] dblock_fps: instead of message and say something about all the negativity, I have actually been watching a lot of different league streamers and it seems like the lobbies are a lot worse on this new split, is there something differen't going on with the matchmaking? seems like a ton of people griefing
[1:37:41] quaninter2: Naive trist LUL
[1:38:29] quaninter2: prolly because its early season and ppl still learning new map and items
[1:39:18] dblock_fps: yeah true
[1:39:52] Alendert_: Stupid Riot WutFace
[1:39:55] tigerbois: the minus 30 is it still a bug, or just because mmr doesnt match rank?
[1:40:13] slumzzz: had a bronze player in my game, is now gold 1 this season, amazing, he was completely clueless
[1:40:15] dblock_fps: Yeah thats frustrating, it sucks cuz its almost like you have to play a different game when you'
[1:40:26] dblock_fps: you're in the lower elo games

[1:42:49] hotmot: wait did riot confirmit was a bug?
[1:43:00] Arnifu: Stupid question, what do you mean by perm -30? As in how does that affect your mmr now?
[1:43:33] triton8484: shit
[1:43:33] quaninter2: so 1 loss = 2 wins?
[1:43:37] Arnifu: Yea, thats harsh
[1:43:38] ElMaverick96: man that‚Äôs fucked up
[1:43:40] HetheriaLoL: essentially it takes 2 wins to gain back from 1 loss and break even. not really fair
[1:44:05] hotmot: a little while KEKW
[1:44:21] gagne11: so essentially 66% wr makes you break even. nobodies hitting 66% wr
[1:44:33] HetheriaLoL: yup
[1:44:36] HetheriaLoL: \
[1:44:46] psquaredlol: winnable?

[1:47:02] Proholm: Sup dude
[1:47:02] psquaredlol: so ur good then
[1:47:15] gagne11: @tigerbois over 20 games doesn‚Äôt count‚Ä¶get 56% over 500+ games
[1:47:52] tigerbois: i mean, ive only played 50games season so far, so probably will fix itself eventually
[1:48:11] ryduhh: yes
[1:48:18] Victor194b: you do
[1:48:22] bluedreamsensi: Big MOBA trying to keep wings down taking all his points
[1:48:30] Dayszen: reason you dont get blue trinket?
[1:48:37] psquaredlol: @tigerbois the thing is, if youre better than the elo youre in, youll climb. so lp gains/losses doesnt matter
[1:49:12] gagne11: so yeah I should have specified, 56% with 300-500+ games‚Ä¶.most grandmaster+ players are running 75 games a week‚Ä¶
[1:49:46] psquaredlol: so if faker was in this elo or tarzaned, they wont be able to climb?
[1:49:53] tigerbois: @gagne11 gotcha
[1:50:03] johnnymath: 2/7 your not over performing
[1:50:08] psquaredlol: sure some games are gonna be 100% loseable. no one win 100games in a row lol. gotta lose sometimes

[2:24:35] Redwinds55: @Wingsofdeath dont feed the trolls
[2:24:36] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Someone brought it up with garen as well
[2:24:48] Waterhead30: Even Senna beats Viego 1v1
[2:25:30] FateTestarossaH: did wukong really blame this game on you lmao
[2:25:42] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Iirc riven r and garen r actually aren't executes and its a skill to know when it's actually going to kill on single cast
[2:25:46] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx

[2:26:05] MadSpectre47: uh
[2:26:12] MadSpectre47: how did that not interrupt
[2:26:21] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Riot doesn't want to take that small skill expression away from garen or given
[2:26:31] Lukicies: wtf? shields prevent recall cancel??
[2:26:42] itszat0ichi: @KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks yea but riven R does extra dmg under % hp, but nothing tells if enemy health is at thast %
[2:26:53] Lukicies: oh, today i learned
[2:26:58] jojayjoo: last stream I saw you play riven you said you might wanted to try IE. Have you had the chance?
[2:27:05] Mikey1479: wingsofdeath is Riven back?
[2:27:34] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Yeah same as garen r, that's just what I remember August saying. Something along those lines
[2:27:41] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Not sure if I agree
[2:27:57] ikkesander: Wukong losing it
[2:29:18] FateTestarossaH: lmao
[2:29:28] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Honestly I wouldn't want an indicator on garen r when it will kill it would feel weird af
[2:29:49] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Years upon years of muscle memory knowing when health bar is low enough to kill on r cast
[2:30:04] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: I'm sure riven mains would feel the same. Some at least
[2:30:12] psquaredlol: ill flame some teammates dont get me wrong, but the reality is, wukong is ur teammate and ur siding with the enemy
[2:30:13] Deetea86: lmao

[2:33:24] itszat0ichi: but some have and some dont, thats the wird thing about it @Wingsofdeath
[2:33:27] KareemAbdulJabarJarBinks: Knowing when your r is going to kill on those 3 champs is a small skill expression that shouldn't be removed

[4:58:02] hotmot: good thing this game on steam and only 30 bucks
[4:58:12] psquaredlol: the thing I don‚Äôt understand is that when I played halo3 it didn‚Äôt make me as toxic or hatred of losing compared to league. even tho both games are team based.
[4:58:53] psquaredlol: halo3 also had voice chat and never any soft inters or griefers. everyone tried and it was just hella fun. man take me back:(
