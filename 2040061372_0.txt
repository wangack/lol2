[0:41:31] taylunobounds: Cowsep are you originally an American or an Aussie
[0:42:10] thesurgicalsurgeonsurge: Thoughts on lethality items on master yi? @cowsep
[0:42:27] AngeloArcana: Just a general use-case. Say you had an AI bot that just "watches" the chat, and copies / pastes those messages without ever being invasive to the original source codes.

[1:00:46] cisphob1a: kinda but it's still very strong 2nd or 3rd, +15 ad for "free" is still very nice on first takedown

[1:07:33] Yang_Lee: i like bork>guisinoos>kraken
[1:07:40] brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd: need tankier yi tbh
[1:08:00] nloc278: 200 gol
[1:08:04] hyperionentropic: Yang_Lee Isn't that the build for like the past 2 years now?
[1:08:23] Yang_Lee: is there a better one yet? xd
[1:08:36] nloc278: titanic hexplate and heartsteel
[1:08:47] 3ggorofls: no AS really isnt good for yi
[1:08:57] hyperionentropic: I mean it's just max dps build is what I'm saying. I'm just wondering how viable this one people are running is. I've seen xin's also run that build
[1:09:00] AngeloArcana: @3ggorofls Troll comment?
[1:09:02] 3ggorofls: cause of double strike and e proc

[1:09:54] AngeloArcana: @3ggorofls Just making sure. That comment had me mad confused. LUL
[1:09:58] diramude: I guess the new season master yi is indeed not the absolute best
[1:09:59] hyperionentropic: surely terminus is better than dominak? Clueless
[1:10:03] Sonyablad: crit build this time?
[1:10:11] Jon71trick: Jon71trick watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[1:10:15] cahallo: you need mortal reminder
[1:10:17] nloc278: buy guinsoo cowsep
[1:10:21] hyperionentropic: diramude You think this is season 3 AP yi? HUH
[1:10:29] 3ggorofls: @AngeloArcana i meant to say titanic first item wouldnt be great cause yi needs AS
[1:10:33] nloc278: i want to see guinso with crit build in action LOL
[1:10:53] Jon71trick: winnable
[1:11:03] Jon71trick: in lower case
[1:11:08] SaulsPhone: I'm always amazed at how much Cowsep can talk
[1:11:34] AngeloArcana: Guinsoos + Titanic just never feels good enough imo. Decent wave clear, but that's going deep into a split push playstyle.
[1:11:35] hyperionentropic: @Cowsep How does new wits end feel? The AS spike feels really noticeable
[1:11:43] SadeqD1: americans generally yap more
[1:11:44] cryptur_: xqcL

[2:28:02] xAstra021: karthus R 0 damage on yi?
[2:28:11] no_soy_pola: !w
[2:28:12] StreamElements: Cowsep is pressing W to reset his auto attack timer. This is why you sometimes see him "randomly" using W in fights.
[2:28:22] R_J_4: @JRad6Official Because only a few people know how to play that thing
[2:29:03] JRad6Official: @R_J_4 i mean the thing is he had like a 53% wr just last patch
[2:29:11] Phytos11: Oh wow, even managed without botrk
[2:29:12] Nevrot1k: @Cowsep so we can aa>hydra reset>meditate reset?

[2:29:52] R_J_4: Terminus is crazy
[2:29:58] JRad6Official: terminus is one of my favorite new items
[2:30:01] Phytos11: @Zargath1 It really is. Getting your teammates to move in low elo is hell LUL with Yi u can just not give a fuk about them
[2:30:31] pun1sherfun: THEY MADE THE WALKING DEAD SHELTER IN AN ITEM
[2:30:33] Nevrot1k: @Cowsep No hexplate?

[2:43:11] DaoUnchained: just b urself
[2:43:14] DaoUnchained: and b-lieve in urself
[2:43:56] SadeqD1: beYIeve in yourself
[2:44:11] Ethernil: ganking at low elo incurs high risk, takes time off your clearing the jungle and even if the gank works your laner might get the kill and be a bad player so the gold is wasted
[2:44:30] dontbro21: i m also trying future market on yi because i like getting my items faster

[3:15:43] craigxen: you could also live on the 2nd floor and rent out the bottom to pay off the mortgage, essentially living for free
[3:15:56] ddmess: it just depends if u mind or dont mind the extra distance to get to stuff
[3:16:01] ButtOnFire: I think i would get a generally quieter place, or maybe delay the purchase to save up more for more options if there is no rush
[3:16:03] Zargath1: @dd_val that's what i do
[3:16:06] Fathai95: are u gonna buy another place after this one? if not then get the 2nd floor, if you do buy another place, get the other one

[5:18:13] LaatiMafia: @my_life_is_pepehands This does not change the fact that in Australia there are 48 million Kangaroos and in Uruguay there are 3,457,380 inhabitants. So if the Kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos.

[5:20:14] R_J_4: I still think it's better than ravenous
[5:20:52] chiri_rs: titanic better for most champs but lethality champs are really strong with profane
[5:21:00] chiri_rs: its like a 1k execute with 3-4 items
[5:21:02] R_J_4: I loved ravenous before this season, the one that would work on spells, now it's back to being bad
[5:21:41] rtjsdrse903: No but it has a crit ratio
[5:21:49] JRad6Official: no, but her ultimate does 4% more damage with more crit
[5:21:54] spy_kek: with Yi dragon is just another jungle camp
[5:22:00] LaatiMafia: @Cowsep " Once Caitlyn completes the channel, she fires a homing bullet toward the target that deals physical damage to the first enemy champion it hits, increased by 0% − 50% (based on critical strike chance)."
[5:22:13] AllAroundTV1: lol

[5:26:13] my_life_is_pepehands: rust community mostly in Youtube and forums
[5:26:17] dxdkushen123: rust only popular when there is a tournament
[5:26:22] chilloriwill: 1,9k viewers for 8mill subs is decent
[5:26:28] LaatiMafia: Some games are a lot more fun to play than watch. Then there's the opposite like League YEP

[5:27:31] blacKmarkeTzyrA: no its fun but hard to keep engaged as a viewer
[5:27:47] my_life_is_pepehands: The older the channel on YouTube or anywhere else, the more subscribers it has and the fewer actual views in the ratio. This applies to everyone. Accounts stop being active, people lose interest, and so on.

[5:38:04] tr1antafyllos: HOW MAny dolars pes 1k view
[5:38:07] R_J_4: Is it proportional to views or is it also affected by the subs you got, how do they count that
[5:38:15] blacKmarkeTzyrA: i wonder if the extension i use now still gets you ad money on yt. it basically fast forwards the ads
[5:38:29] スカサハ: titanic meditate double reset makes yi almost a burst champion and I love it

[6:10:27] my_life_is_pepehands: @shazlongo10 I was stuck very hard in silver 3 every season. I got -20 or more for a defeat, +17-19 for victories. But as soon as he rose to silver 1 and then gold 4, he began to gain and lose as usual, which is how it should be. The essence of the problem is that the longer you stay in the division (win-lose-win-lose) the more firmly you get stuck in it, less will be given for victory and more will be taken away for defeat. It's a terrible system, but that's the reality.

[8:31:28] my_life_is_pepehands: @DirtyDeeds4Free Well, these are the players, they tend to whine and laugh at everything (I'm talking about the chat). They can't even do that in theory.
[8:31:40] uddertastic: HUH
[8:31:53] DirtyDeeds4Free: Solo dolo barron LETS GOOO

[8:34:34] RareSave: 2:40 min ad feels like a never ending thing.
[8:34:35] wesleymelon: getting coral is crazy good early on and she can go kraken titanic stride which is just insane for catchinga nd survivability @benpro1shot
[8:34:42] wesleymelon: But if she's not ahead or pushing an advantage she's pretty useless
[8:35:08] HellKnight1045: lethality and mages being broken is so bad to play against
[8:35:20] wesleymelon: Basically a master yi with even less mobility but a pretty strong AOE knock up  for engaging
