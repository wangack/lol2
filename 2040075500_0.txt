[4:24:31] TwitchTime89: Sadge nope
[4:24:34] sly_tentacle: they are super playful, my sister had some back in the day
[4:24:35] vegandiamond: WHO IS KYLE????
[4:24:36] denunciator: not the kael
[4:24:40] EpicNarwhal_: sounds like me when i don't get attention
[4:24:40] redtauro: my hamster bit me, and my mom made me return him. I didnt know you were not supposed to wake them up abruptly to pet or hold
[4:24:42] h0lymaccaroni: @bladetrinity16 i think i know which one and its the saddest video ever
[4:24:54] waveofpanic: rabbits are active at dawn and dusk
[4:24:55] MrKafay: Yeah, my father had one but but we had to give it away Sadge
[4:24:56] denunciator: oh nooo
[4:25:02] TwitchTime89: ROTFL

[4:27:15] ZuesesBeard: Sugar gliders are illegal in cali apparently actually
[4:27:15] danipwnsu: They allready live so short, would break my heart to lose it so fast. If one has multiple dogs, i guess its easier to adopt an elderly dog
[4:27:17] s0k0ngan: i got my dog when she was 5 years old
[4:27:21] denunciator: that's why people adopt kids who can like speak and are potty trained
[4:27:28] h0lymaccaroni: "like too much" lol thats sweet

[4:28:35] denunciator: it's coarse and rough and irritating, and gets everywhere. not like here, down here everything's smooth
[4:28:36] TwitchTime89: yeah
[4:28:38] h0lymaccaroni: most things are better with less people
[4:28:39] trialtest_: what a polite cat
[4:28:40] denunciator: actual line from the film btw
[4:28:46] danipwnsu: Yea beaches where lots of people are, are just dirty. I was on a very low populated beach in Thailand. It was heaven on earth with white clean coral sand

[4:30:37] denunciator: Langkawi too
[4:30:54] vegandiamond: you took its bed ANGRE
[4:31:02] bladetrinity16: that makes sense, cats typically bed in the same place when they can
[4:31:03] TwitchTime89: cats look sneaky
[4:31:05] MrKafay: My cat wants me to open the blanket and then cuddle agaisnt my torso rooLurk
[4:31:09] denunciator: when you told the story and said it was given up for adoption my heart broke Sadge

[5:27:08] Dogomental: dont marry adc and go mid sometimes
[5:27:29] h0lymaccaroni: @kairin_ i dont mean that in a berating way but then its even worse to let the baby near in the first place if the dog has trust issues and can't read the behavior of the little human
[5:27:30] ghostringtft: the best advice is to be nice to ur teammates <3
[5:27:34] ghostringtft: or muteall
