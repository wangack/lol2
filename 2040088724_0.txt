Diamond+ is where it may be easier to confuse that someone is scripting. And even then, that's literally like less than 50,000 players worldwide and like <1% of the game's ranked population.

[2:37:07] saw141: Even answering that question Chris just said he's pretty sure he has, not that he's completely sure. He's played WAY more than me at a way higher tier.

[2:37:22] highwindsx: I agree @saw141

[2:37:55] saw141: That's such an incredible low incidence rate.
[2:38:13] saw141: Yeah that's definitely sus and if they were they should be banned.

[2:38:47] Yep_Banana: idk but scripters should be get fees irl, I really hate when somebody cheats and ruins people's experience just because he wanna win but he sucks
[2:39:00] saw141: But see that's the thing if it's that glaringly obvious then Riot should manually review scripting reports, or use AI or something. If it's literally every single time with inhuman reaction times then it should be obvious to humans.
[2:39:04] metalwrath22222: highwindsx nah, it was instant every single time. it was very obvious

If cheating were insanely rampant in League I'd understand but it just seems like a completely unnecessary change with bad reasoning. And I'm going to stop playing once they force the requirement.
