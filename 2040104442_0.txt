Is he capable of reducing my salary?

[2:25:46] PickleSnot: @ltjimdangle EFf'em. part of the split mentality. heck with the flamers
[2:25:47] Paul_Preserves: RIOT healing
[2:25:48] Nightbot: if i missed ur question just repost i answer after game I PROMSIE ILL ANSWER just ping me
[2:26:00] BlueEyesVapeDragon: Late game Senna monkaS
[2:26:08] fil0wl: full hp from 1 minion wave 😭😭 what
[2:26:15] Neuro_Alpha: @BlueEyesVapeDragon so aids
[2:26:17] CN_Holiday_Special: in terms of 1v1 potential, I definetly think Gwen is a great splitpusher. In terms of tower taking, yorick is my second go to after trundle.
[2:26:18] OskiRL: time to mute all
[2:26:30] trakd_was_banned: howcome no triforce? 1 shotting towers not worth?
[2:26:31] 2muchkawaii: oof opponent had 5 hyper carries and simply won eh
[2:26:33] JarvanDreadlord: !garen
[2:26:33] Nightbot: when he comes to q you do W > auto > q you can do this all before his q lands, then when he es just get out of the e asap dont auto him during his E
[2:26:57] Bruhat2r2: can you backdoor maybe?
[2:27:08] jalex54202: @Bruhat2r2 azir keeps matching him :(
[2:27:10] WitchyWay: @Bruhat2r2 baron recall, hard
[2:27:13] Sarnyroth: So cringe that Azir gets to be a teamfight monster but can also win the side lane 1v1
[2:27:21] basedjabroni: !gnar
[2:27:22] Nightbot: just survive dont push vs them. ulting mega gnar gives more
[2:27:29] 2muchkawaii: @Bruhat2r2 azir has been matching him quite well, he keeps stopping him in sidelanes
[2:28:00] fil0wl: Alex Shaco on ur team = GG
[2:28:01] Kardain: shaco seems limited this ga,
[2:28:07] Kardain: game
[2:28:09] Bruhat2r2: @2muchkawaii my idea was to do it without minions; walk through jungle, kill inhib and then nexus. But maybe more a low elo thing that wouldnt work here :D
[2:28:09] aymoon764: !swain
[2:28:13] MykeL13: no triforce anymore?

[2:28:23] BlueEyesVapeDragon: Surprised Senna didnt go  Cyclosword
[2:28:27] Sarnyroth: AP Shaco supp was a bad call, AP only good info engage comps.
[2:28:36] MrGuwee: honestly ? tp top get base
[2:28:38] ltjimdangle: the best split pushers are fast so they can run when the enemy team decides to try to collapse on them. garen, trynd, sion, trundle
[2:28:50] TheIcarusGuy: !guide
[2:28:50] ltjimdangle: yorick too slow tbh - if the enemy team decides to kill him, he dies

[2:28:53] 2muchkawaii: @2muchkawaii wait, there are no nexus towers, then it's a must they can't win a 5v5 anyway KEKW
[2:29:04] twirlypanda: what is the build for splitpush udyr, lethality with q max?
[2:29:08] dzukillsleftnutisbig: i dont understand How people play ap shaco
[2:29:33] Bruhat2r2: @2muchkawaii yes, nexus towers gone already :)
[2:29:38] Sarnyroth: AP Shaco is zone control
[2:29:55] Kardain: Ap shaco is good, but top lane and needs to take kills early
[2:29:58] sonniko765: he just needs 30s to end the game, maybe he gets the chance
[2:30:07] MrGuwee: sneak behind and get inhib and nexus
[2:30:14] ltjimdangle: shaco top lane requires enemy laner to not know how shaco works
[2:30:19] WitchyWay: needs a deep ward, and his team to sacrifice a forced fight to stop recalls
[2:30:20] みいけ: lol top azir?
[2:30:23] Kardain: But Jungle ap no not atm
[2:30:25] TezFPS: shaco needs to sneak around to put a ward around their base top
[2:30:29] Kardain: Azir was top
[2:30:34] ltjimdangle: any top laner with half a brain just plays the lane from river side, away from the bushes and shaco might as well be sitting in fountain
[2:30:42] kam0s_: ban senna
[2:31:03] woowthatskindagood: senna azir late game gg
[2:31:04] osrs_lemon101: open inhib to nexus no minions needed
[2:31:14] aendsh: @osrs_lemon101 still too much time, he cant
[2:31:14] Sarnyroth: Who needs a real top laner when you can just pick a mage like Azir

[2:34:32] TrundleTop1: yea @yeye5_star
[2:34:33] Paul_Preserves: WitchyWay i dont think the issue is bans just people not using the broken champs, like imagine picking vayne or shaco when senna janna seraphine are so much broken
[2:34:39] yeye5_star: i mat jax , after his e ended i ran him down

[2:35:29] paladinlaw: tri is not grat on trundle at the moment imho, there's so many better options
[2:35:32] trakd_was_banned: @Kardain obviously, but he never builds tri imwondering why
[2:35:38] vsmilotic: SMOrc
[2:35:38] trakd_was_banned: it allows u to take towers so quickly
[2:35:43] trakd_was_banned: but maybe u just do that anyway
[2:35:53] ltjimdangle: like this game - adc could play varus or caitlin or ashe and get free win in lane
[2:35:55] paladinlaw: so does rav > bork though
[2:35:59] emrys307: how about lich bane?
[2:35:59] ltjimdangle: but instead locks in zigs
[2:36:05] WitchyWay: @trakd_was_banned the last game, he went vs a good 'matching' azir, he needed survivability, and couldnt reach the towers with azir there.

[2:43:56] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.
[2:44:30] HandicappedShoes: nice pasta
[2:44:49] BlueEyesVapeDragon: If Renekton goes Tabis this game for some reason, it is grief

All you trolls are MALDING because she doesn’t reply to your tweet comments probably. Not me though.. I have full faith in her. That’s why she replied to me a couple days ago when I congratulated her.. she literally replied? And said thanks??
