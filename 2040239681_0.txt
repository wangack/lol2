[1:19:04] bateri_boi: Boss its riot they dont think too much it hurts
[1:19:12] fireefogo: I honestly do not think Riot have any clue what they are trying to do. The game is just living by its own name. And that's it. Whatever they do, people will just keep playing. So they don't give a damn.
[1:19:15] KururuBufo: @Aureus79 ppl wanted to day back on league of tanks

With a spear in hand and a shield on his arm, He charges into battle, causing great harm.  His passive, Aegis Protection, keeps him alive, Blocking attacks, making foes strive.  Heartseeker Strike, a powerful slam, Dishing out damage, he don't give a damn.
