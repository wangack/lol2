[2:06:13] quark978: ppl always seem to forget that streamers are inherently entertainers which is naturally a draining profession
[2:06:16] elenawoo: @newregion24 i think if you start out as a hobby you will enjoy it more which then will make people want to watch you.  I think getting into anything like streaming JUST for the money is a one way ticket to not enjoy what you choose to do.  but at any rate at least in the US you need to have multiple outlets for making money‚Ä¶ but its also SO important to have hobbies.  not sure if any of this made sense lol
