[0:06:54] GodDamnSwede: after much thought and consideration I've made my mind up. This season of league is an absolute atrocity. It's impossible to have fun, no one interacts or fights unless they can one shot and it's turned into pure snowball gameplay.  Also fuck the matchmaking for constantly giving me bronze players and put us against diamond and plat players
