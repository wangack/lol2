[2:51:40] Copperhawk_: interesting
[2:51:45] labl4b: @bsololane so what do u think the better build is

[2:52:22] bsololane: btw im in game i will do seryalds tho
[2:52:38] ChaseShaco: seryldas into opportunity or eclipse is optrimal i belive

[4:19:29] mythicalord1: oh god, and the xin match up goes from bad to worse now that he starts with a kill and assist
[4:19:30] RizzEmWithTheTism: just seems really garbage
[4:19:39] HelloImJohn: i think ppl build opportunity/ voltaic on kah zix in most cases because it is 500 to 700g cheaper but the hydra is better

[4:32:58] Galkaria: @bearded_wolf_ it's been a thing for awhile, quality based matchmaking was patented and put in use by EA to ensure players get crushed by the enemy while also pushing microtransactions for faster ranks / skins. more games have adopted similar quality based matchmaking, funnily enough Fortnite doesn't have it, since it just throws 50 bots and 50 randoms into a map

[5:40:23] claus_052: did it once and i didnt need more of it
[5:40:28] HappyCupcake13: why do? shaco has fast clear anyway, and the burst with the profane first item is not that significant

[5:40:58] Brittykittie: he just forever tilted all of the time
[5:41:03] x9Dane: Sadge
[5:41:06] claus_052: profane is good for clear (even faster) and it has the cool 700 dmg active that doesnt cancel your aa to activate
[5:41:09] Brittykittie: hes back on his support kitten grind
[5:41:27] x9Dane: I knew he was mad when he stopped dancing with me and started killing everyone.
[5:41:32] HappyCupcake13: it s not 700dmg when u do it first item
[5:41:34] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[5:41:34] claus_052: its exactly what i needed always when someone escaped in 200

[5:42:03] HappyCupcake13: i tried that on rengar, and it always felt better with hubris first item and then profane, doubles the dmg
[5:42:10] Brittykittie: he was like if we lose this game im uninstalling league
[5:42:15] bearded_wolf_: how is he 3 levels down and almost 2 shots you lol
[5:42:18] claus_052: nice dmg
