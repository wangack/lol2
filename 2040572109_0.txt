[0:23:20] Syluxrox: Jhin can snowball real hard, but falls off if team doesnt help, but MF doesnt need to snowball to still shit out damage at all stages.
[0:23:28] Fateovercast: udyr is obnoxious no matter who youre playing imo
[0:23:47] shadow_boi1: @Fateovercast He's also immune to your insults

[0:32:47] mediocynical: Bro said "give me free entertainment the way I want it!!!!!!"
[0:32:55] Fateovercast: @Mpolo98 problem was he was whinging about it rather than just simply asking if he was playing jhin
[0:33:06] bigbrother0012: Is not about winning is about sending a message
[0:33:14] Festival_Pizza: BabyRage i watch for free so u should do what i say
[0:33:17] Fateovercast: asking for jhin games is one thing, but demeaning people for playing other things is not ok
[0:33:18] Csarkaiser1: Ah okey okey ^^
[0:33:24] MistzyMoon: Not gonna lie. I have no idea how people have the constant energy to be an asshole, or angry, or being a Karen or whatever. Like how do you have that energy to stay like that?
[0:33:24] peshecito: @Mpolo98 it is kinda rude, I mean Taco is trying his best to climb :C
[0:33:24] fdnico: @Mpolo98 he just lost a game and some guy came and say 'stick to jhin' wtf

[2:10:00] Numbah214: yeah... even lltrigger, my other favorite league streamer, is convinced you have to play back as jhin until you get lethality

[2:10:10] Silvah: since when do we have that 6yr badge?
[2:10:11] Anacondom: is crit build not good anymore or the lethality buff made this build that much better?

[2:11:04] Miles1402: @Silvah he added them like couple months ago i think
[2:11:17] Numbah214: @Anacondom lethality is disgusting right now; and i honestly hope the lethality change gets reverted for ranged champions, at least.
[2:11:20] Silvah: @Miles1402 so Im just blind NOTED
[2:11:25] nabbster14: @anch0u_ and critical build?
[2:11:26] Noeliosis: nice play

[2:12:17] BanditSteinkamp: I just paid 50 bucks for mcdonalds nuggets. Do you hire moderators?

[2:12:35] Numbah214: @Anacondom and the sad thing is, they don't take this into account and give the items ranged penalties like bruiser items
[2:12:36] miketalica96: !playlist
[2:12:55] klauning: ola

[2:15:25] demonminer3: no hubris?
[2:15:26] klauning: playing AD kennen with AP being busted is criminal
[2:15:57] m2o0: Pretty sure "ignore Diana" is titling enough for her
[2:16:03] anch0u_: @nabbster14 what I personally do as a jhin OTP is [for crit : Stormrazor->boots->collector/Dominik->rapidfire->dominik/collector->IE or bloodthirster], and for lethality I go [youmuu-> collector->boots -> rapidfire->dominik->The knife I don’t remember his name but he stacks Energized and is super OP with assassins]
[2:16:17] GamerHats: Ngl wasn't expecting bards Q to actually connect with wall there
[2:16:34] GamerHats: the fact it can stun on wall adjacent to the hit target is kinda jank
[2:16:35] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[2:16:40] Silvah: @GamerHats you should always expect it
[2:16:43] Silvah: bard Q is weird
[2:16:45] jeetshallah: i think MF is perma ban worthy, just perma runs away with passive and eventually presses R
[2:17:18] GamerHats: @Silvah I tend to avoid being near any wall or players if it hits, so i avoid the scenario majority of times, so weird to see it happen at times
[2:17:18] nabbster14: @anch0u_ thanks!!
[2:17:25] jeetshallah: esp with how many times its being spammed bot idk i jus hate it so much haha
[2:17:27] chever337: @jeetshallah if everybody got a permaban for so little there would be no players on euw
[2:17:27] bladesurge_: @IKeepItTaco is exhaust better then ghost rn or is it just preference?
[2:17:33] Silvah: why ban mf?
[2:17:39] Silvah: just spam seraphine

[2:18:05] walmartimport: Lethal Tempo bork rage blade Terminus AD kennen is niche pick in LCK vs Udyr etc splitpush
[2:18:10] anch0u_: @nabbster14 don’t rush Dominik with the lethality build, ur lethality allows u to deal decent damages to tanks during early I think
[2:18:22] Lickity_splyt: crazy damage

[4:32:49] jillcaps17: cuntrarian
[4:32:49] Klony99: Contrarian, yes. But also intellectually dishonest.
[4:32:50] alinator7: theres an argument that you shouldve disengaged after missing w instead. but i dont play adc so idk
[4:33:11] miniPODz: I'm actually curious how high you can take jhin when he is good if your gm when he was not as good

[4:35:25] AJNinja2001: @CeltiWD thought you were leaving?
[4:35:29] gloww1337: @CeltiWD I wrote just because you're a certain rank in this game it doesn't mean you ARE GOOD AT THE GAME, that comes to streamers aswell.
[4:35:46] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[4:35:47] nikipaul293: Pog
[4:35:55] gloww1337: @CeltiWD This game is all about understanding.

[4:36:24] Clainoire: MrFawkinSunshine you fucking sure are, but we irons are different species so dw
[4:36:26] jillcaps17: an opportunist if u will
[4:36:27] lener311: @MrFawkinSunshine u are unique <3
[4:36:36] MrFawkinSunshine: @Clainoire i dont know how to get to IRON
[4:36:38] MrFawkinSunshine: LUL
[4:36:40] fevgatos_live: we want your thoughts on senna players! story time
[4:36:43] gloww1337: @MrFawkinSunshine Not necessarily, you can be good at the game even if you're Iron ranked but it depends on the effort you're willing to sacrifice to climb. =]
[4:36:49] XChaoLanX: it's always the same damn idiots
[4:36:55] Clainoire: MrFawkinSunshine peepoSad
[4:37:00] XChaoLanX: they lose the arguments and resort to ad homimen
[4:37:02] XChaoLanX: smh my head
[4:37:27] Clainoire: gloww1337 nah fam if you're iron you play to drop there, starting rank is gold for new accounts
[4:37:31] XChaoLanX: absolutely no ability to properly reflect on their own actions and arguments
[4:37:36] MrFawkinSunshine: @gloww1337 hmm dont make much sense
[4:37:42] MrFawkinSunshine: But ive never been IRon
[4:37:48] chi_meng_lee: ikeepitSMILERS ikeepitSMILERS
[4:38:01] jillcaps17: RIVEN GETTING TOP
[4:38:09] derekpalubiSki: you should try to hit one ult shot
[4:38:17] MrFawkinSunshine: i typically hover around mid gold mmr but i hardly ever play anymore
[4:38:25] gloww1337: @MrFawkinSunshine In order to win a game you need to rely on 4 different "humanbeing" in the game or yourself so yea count out the oddds. =)
[4:38:30] KayPrimo: bro there are jhin ults coming thru my window
[4:38:36] ArtieOfficial: @gloww1337 this, my account is so old and i never play ranked so ive never really climbed
[4:38:54] Tesarex: Tesarex subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months, currently on a 1 month streak! hi taco, hows new lethality treating u?
[4:39:20] FACECHECKSKARNER: grats on master g
[4:39:23] MrFawkinSunshine: @ArtieOfficial yea i ll do placements and liek quit rank LUL im typically placed high silver with a gold MMR peak i got was gold 1 like a few seasons ago
[4:39:23] RIDZXII: Watch Perkz's take on supports after the LEC game today
[4:39:24] FACECHECKSKARNER: finally back in it
[4:39:33] NapNapoleon: He's been banned btw, so i don't think he's still here?
[4:39:35] XChaoLanX: almost no one who doesnt play bot lane understands that
[4:39:36] gloww1337: @Clainoire Sry but you're wrong, the mmr isn't always balanced and adapted to the certain rank you're in.
[4:39:43] MrFawkinSunshine: I think i have 10 games played since August
[4:39:49] Distinct_Haze: @RIDZXII link
[4:39:51] XChaoLanX: in 99% of the cases adcs get the blame for losing bot, not the support
[4:40:02] gloww1337: @ArtieOfficial Because you don't prioritize climbing in the game. =]
[4:40:21] RIDZXII: I have to clip it, but to summarize - he mentioned about supports being OP and all supps should be enjoying this heavenly patch for them
[4:40:22] Glyers: How can support be the most carried role when they have the most power to drag others down?
[4:40:31] XChaoLanX: @gloww1337 yeah I banned him because he called you a monkey cuck and it got auto modded
[4:40:32] ArtieOfficial: @MrFawkinSunshine I think I peaked silver 2 with like. 15 some games and that was back in s7 or 8? And im not nearly good enough to 1v9 in the elo the matchmaker still thinks i should be
[4:40:45] nikipaul293: He used it on senna earlier
[4:40:56] chi_meng_lee: ikeepitSMILERS
[4:40:58] NapNapoleon: they're fed as HECK
[4:41:00] SyrobeNA: Aware
[4:41:02] NapNapoleon: I think that's a win
[4:41:02] fevgatos_live: dont u miss stormrazor as first item? that smooth buttery last hit on minions
[4:41:19] gloww1337: @XChaoLanX Haha thank you for sharing but it's fine he got nothing else to say. =)
[4:41:34] chi_meng_lee: :( he trolled
[4:41:41] chi_meng_lee: ikeepitCUPID
[4:41:48] XChaoLanX: why did you keep attacking with E mark on you? ICANT
[4:41:49] NapNapoleon: Taco trolling tuesday
[4:42:00] MrFawkinSunshine: @NapNapoleon its monday
[4:42:01] ArtieOfficial: @Distinct_Haze I wanna see
[4:42:03] Viables: feel like you woulda had to flash even if he missed ult right?
[4:42:08] MrFawkinSunshine: @NapNapoleon hate to give u the bad news
[4:42:15] NapNapoleon: NOOOO
[4:42:45] Klony99: @MrFawkinSunshine No it's not...
[4:42:49] Macklez_: I just won 4 games in a row to hit masters with your stream on. watching taco = hit masters
[4:42:51] m2o0: The cat is on the loose
[4:42:56] XChaoLanX: YEP balanced

[4:43:46] gloww1337: This is what the game is all about.
[4:44:02] RIDZXII: https://youtu.be/ry2MAal0Qwc?si=c-KDXMJh0jwEE2zE&t=3000
[4:44:11] jillcaps17: @RIDZXII yes he said post it
[4:44:15] gloww1337: lol.
[4:44:18] MrFawkinSunshine: and if a bot lane wins it its usuallys the supports fault
[4:44:20] SpartanDumpster: @IKeepItTaco if you had Pokemon IRL would you teach them to wipe their ass?
[4:44:24] Aoi_Ana_: is  not our fault :c
[4:44:32] Jazziph: WAIT
[4:44:33] Aoi_Ana_: maybe a little
[4:44:38] Jazziph: you used to play dota 2?
[4:44:43] Jazziph: mmr?
[4:45:02] XChaoLanX: !masterjhinquote
[4:45:10] ArtieOfficial: Didnt you quit league for a while and then Jhin came out and he got you to come back? I think august mentioned that in his last stream
[4:45:12] XChaoLanX: !mastersjhinquote
[4:45:12] Nightbot: "Sometimes you have to tactically int." - Taco November 2017
[4:45:13] MrFawkinSunshine: @Jazziph what ever is as high as possible with out being pro is basically what he said
[4:45:15] shimapanenjoyer: there are 2 roles that have the most impact in this game, support and jungle
[4:45:19] m2o0: Wtf is Lillia
[4:45:26] ArtieOfficial: in other words, What did you do before Jhin
[4:45:29] jillcaps17: what happened there, taco?
[4:45:31] Nicholai_Deus: bot lane always has impact, if they didn't, they would call themselves top lane
[4:45:31] gloww1337: HOOOOOOORSEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYY
[4:45:31] XChaoLanX: still true to this day Okayge
[4:45:33] Jazziph: @MrFawkinSunshine yeah you can be 5k or so I just want to know the number
[4:45:38] lener311: lillia ???
[4:45:42] miniPODz: Wait how did rengo not kill with that jump
[4:45:42] Jazziph: I used to play dota around the same mmr bracket
[4:46:08] gloww1337: Guys
[4:46:09] Jazziph: oh
[4:46:14] its_sonara: kinda wild that lilia does so much burst damage while building the DoT + prolonged fighting items
[4:46:18] Jazziph: Nice
[4:46:23] reaper_of_aspects: Yo taco!
[4:46:26] gloww1337: What's the primary difference between Dota and Lol?
[4:46:33] reaper_of_aspects: hows it going/ how are the games
[4:46:35] SpartanDumpster: ikeepitCheer100 If you had Pokemon IRL would you teach them to wipe they ass? You can't have a Machamp walking around with a poopy butt! ikeepitFLOWER
[4:46:35] Jazziph: yeah around 5k+ was the average for high elo at the start

[4:46:46] AogSpirit: the courrier @gloww1337 and the denying creeps
[4:46:48] MrFawkinSunshine: @its_sonara im fine with her damage its her MS i cant stand
[4:46:59] gloww1337: @the courrier? What do you mean?
[4:47:13] AogSpirit: its a messanger that brings u itens from base so u dont have to press b
[4:47:23] AogSpirit: messenger*
[4:47:25] gloww1337: Ooo alright
[4:47:38] reaper_of_aspects: no hubris this game?
[4:47:42] ArtieOfficial: doesnt dota have turn rates? I cant notice them when i watch clips and such from games but i dont play it
[4:47:47] gloww1337: Same lvl, item and abilities?
[4:47:56] gloww1337: System*
[4:48:01] AogSpirit: nah if im not mistaking u can get to 25
[4:48:14] Spartogus: Just getting back into league recently, what is the meta for supports right now?
[4:48:16] AogSpirit: item and abilities are totally diff but same principals
[4:48:36] ArtieOfficial: DotA also has way less power in the items, the strongest items in DotA are mostly good for actives, like their version of QSS from what I know
[4:48:50] MetalFire23x: Ah the sweet sound of Project: Jhin.
[4:49:00] NapNapoleon: The perfect wall.
[4:49:06] MetalFire23x: scripted wind wall lol
[4:49:09] gloww1337: @Spartogus Milio, Naut, Lulu, Soraka
[4:49:32] gloww1337: @Spartogus Senna no doubt.
[4:49:49] gloww1337: Alright guys ty for the responding on my message. =)
[4:49:52] Spartogus: gotchya, I mained raka about 3 years ago
[4:50:00] gloww1337: I've never tried Dota.
[4:50:10] Spartogus: so ill have to find a good build for her
[4:50:23] Draco_2472: howdy howdy
[4:50:40] oneistotwo: !build
[4:50:41] Nightbot: https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/14-1-ikeepittacos-grandmaster-jhin-guide-season-14-569038
[4:50:45] Draco_2472: finaly catch a stream runing
[4:51:03] gloww1337: @Spartogus You should primarily adapt your items based on champion, comps and items.
[4:51:38] gloww1337: Is using wards the same principal in dota... ?
[4:51:39] NapNapoleon: I think taco triggered the dragon who helped in the fight
[4:52:01] NapNapoleon: I think we'll need to see the replay for that fight, because maybe taco carried hard with that dragon hit
[4:52:09] MetalFire23x: sus dodge lol
[4:52:26] browy_eu: My guy got a wish.com Viper on his team
[4:52:33] AogSpirit: u can block camps in dota as well
[4:52:36] AogSpirit: so they dont respawn
[4:52:40] AogSpirit: and u can stack neutrals
[4:53:29] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[4:53:30] wrathinussart: holy shit outplayed
[4:53:41] thedragonnerd: Hello Taco, long time no see
[4:53:49] Vladdddddddddddddddd: but you distracted her from saving 2 towers :D
[4:53:49] nonexistent_man: riot where is the adc zhonyas Sadge
[4:53:52] gloww1337: lol dat horsey
[4:54:00] nikipaul293: Rfc woulda been good there
[4:54:12] shimapanenjoyer: well ye, if u get hit by anything she will just CC you and nuke u afterwards
[4:54:28] shimapanenjoyer: as said as it is
[4:54:34] shimapanenjoyer: sad*
[4:54:45] gloww1337: I heard that professional Dota players makes way more money compared with Lol players... =S
[4:55:25] MrFawkinSunshine: liek real professional sports
[4:55:37] AogSpirit: nope
[4:55:56] AogSpirit: soccer players get paid anyway
[4:56:04] AogSpirit: basket players as well
[4:56:52] MrFawkinSunshine: @AogSpirit yes in other professional sports, the salaries and caps etc are based on league revenue so even the bad teams still make $
[4:56:59] gloww1337: It's sadge.
[4:57:00] ArtieOfficial: i think thats a part of why NA never does well in internationals for LoL, the money from streaming makes it not worth putting in as much energy as other regions do for a chance to win Riot's smaller pots.
[4:57:01] lener311: hard game
[4:58:22] AogSpirit: dota has a thing where they split the ''battle pass'' earnings with the professional players, so it gets even bigger
[4:58:22] valo_ren: quid is doing well this year tho. He was trash last year, but he carried game one
[4:58:31] jadenkay: what team from LEC do you support Taco?
[4:58:34] ArtieOfficial: yeah i noticed imports generally dont do very good. We have AMAZING talent natively, even if some of our best have all but quit pro play.
[4:59:24] MetalFire23x: First strike is why you lost that. So close
[4:59:24] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D
[5:00:01] 2laggy4you: what a sick team tbh
[5:00:18] Darber228: They removed bc they cba do skins and battle passes
[5:00:28] AogSpirit: nah, i dont think so, i stopped playing but till 2 years ago they didnt, i have so exclusive skins that are worth some money because of that
[5:01:10] gloww1337: @AogSpirit What do you play today?
[5:01:19] XChaoLanX: crazy how easy the game becomes once senna actually right clicks
[5:01:31] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[5:01:33] akirafudo0655: GG
[5:01:40] tigerv00: that really was a gg
[5:01:42] AogSpirit: i play league, but just casually
[5:01:51] lethalbonsai: first rank for today and i filled with a yummi who tilted from 1 ping and trolled lane XD
[5:01:51] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D
[5:01:59] oneistotwo: @IKeepItTaco is lethality better than crit
[5:02:01] valo_ren: Can someone tell me how I lose 14 LP for an Afk teammate? in a 7 minute game where we already had a kill?
[5:02:10] lethalbonsai: @oneistotwo depends

[5:04:25] Macklez_: @IKeepItTaco how much did you just gain from that win?
[5:04:25] gloww1337: @valo_ren Should be easy for you to climb out.
[5:04:32] coreyelle: damn

[5:05:03] gloww1337: @valo_ren How many ranked games do you got... ? What lvl are you?
[5:05:11] shimapanenjoyer: @gloww1337 i had it happen to me, i was on 64% win rate in diamond II elo, and for some weird reason, i was getting progressivly less LP the more i won, it went to the point where i was getting like 14lp for win and -30lp for lose, even tho i was still above 60% win rate
[5:05:19] shimapanenjoyer: i just made new account :D
[5:05:24] valo_ren: @gloww1337 lvl 155, and rn i have 10 games into new season

[5:06:40] Macklez_: Sadge
[5:06:42] adudewatchingvideos1: solarbacca just hit rank 1 na rn
[5:06:44] jillcaps17: @IKeepItTaco hey taco, what do you think the biggest problem with league of legends is as a whole?
[5:07:04] shimapanenjoyer: @gloww1337 that particular account was in EUW, i play in EUNE/EUW, i used to play, i quit the game few months ago
[5:07:05] Macklez_: Gladge
[5:07:15] Edyrra: Is TrueSkill 2 already in effect?
[5:07:46] gloww1337: @valo_ren If I were you I'd make a new account your mmr seems to be fked up, I don't know how much the mmr affects your actually skill-level.
[5:07:46] shimapanenjoyer: @gloww1337 i was basically alternating between these 2 servers, diffrent friends, diffrent servers
[5:07:57] jillcaps17: facts
[5:08:05] valo_ren: @gloww1337 I would, but I bought skins :'(
[5:08:37] Madghyr: the jhim?
[5:08:45] gloww1337: @valo_ren Damn man, that sucks... They should add some kind of add system so you can transfer skins from one to another account.
[5:08:49] subtletea43: I think the biggest problem with league is that it takes a tremendous amount of work even to just be mediocre, and similar to other competitive games with extremely high skill ceilings like SSBM, it gets harder and harder to get into as the average player skill tends to increase.
[5:09:00] portpolly: 🔥🐀
[5:09:17] lener311: the melancholic playlist tpday
[5:09:17] valo_ren: @subtleroy the barrier to entry in this game is insane. I remember when I almost quit at the start

[5:09:30] greengreetings: whats ur favourite food(s) taco?

[5:09:37] subtletea43: @valo_ren Same. If my friends didn't play I probably wouldn't have either
[5:10:00] valo_ren: @subtleroy the only reason I joined was cause there was a hot girl on the esports team at school LMAO
[5:10:04] RadiantWisp: Taco, you absolutely suck.

[5:14:57] AlvesRei: Sometimes when we only know the voice of a streamer we just "make up" a face in our minds that most times is so different from the real one. but in this case we have the frog. we can just say it's the frog's voice hehe
