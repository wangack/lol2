[1:26:01] hynnian: @An_Actual_Ape but its also worse for the pro botlane who will have to play with the random in order to practice for their pro match
[1:26:05] TheWildHaggis: strong off role and sigma male vibes
[1:26:37] An_Actual_Ape: @hynnian yeah but thats what scrims are for. its the same in korea and everyone talks about how good their solo q is so thats clearly not the problem
