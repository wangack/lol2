[0:20:24] GoldSongGDK: zap hosting any good
[0:21:05] potdesu: they hella expensive so they better be good
[0:21:27] RamseyWOW: you can pass down the lucky passive but they wont look shiny.
[0:21:33] RamseyWOW: so you get the lucky stats but not the looks
[0:21:54] daboigus: so like is this game kinda like Ark survival but with knockoff pokemon?
[0:22:24] potdesu: Ark gameplay with Pokemon skins instead of Dinos
[0:22:31] potdesu: and some mechanics from botw
[0:22:38] Wrongkonkoma: Hmm They offer life time hosting
[0:22:48] potdesu: Life time hosting is kinda lit
[0:22:51] daboigus: @potdesu gotcha, thanks
[0:24:34] xxpuffyghostxx: masochist is defense abe
[0:25:04] Kureshuzu: ig so
[0:25:09] RamseyWOW: You can even breed the legendary pals to pass on the legendary trait. That is how you make the best pals.
[0:25:42] RamseyWOW: There are 4 legendary pals, they are all bosses
[0:26:08] RamseyWOW: yep, all 50

[0:27:44] BigBrotherKevin: I guess that's the spot
[0:28:17] RamseyWOW: A lot of the breeds are gender dependent too. For example M Quivern + F Chillet = Anubis but not if you reverse genders
[0:28:39] imertsanchez: ^
[0:28:57] little_dahlia: LUL
[0:29:20] valohaaaaa: Goodmorning Abe!
