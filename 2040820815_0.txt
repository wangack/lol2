[0:36:29] yousefx1: Hmm so macro, i think so too, thnx
[0:36:35] The_HeraId: @yousefx1 imo, depends on rank. Just knowing macro wins you games well into gold though. I mechanically suck but know enough macro ti climb
[0:36:41] readerotl: xdd

[0:38:52] readerotl: ye
[0:38:52] The_HeraId: I think at the end of the day, between Macro and Mechanics is this: You don't need to try and out play to win a fight if you knew enough to be in the winning position
[0:39:04] pholtos: viegno damage

[2:21:27] danteyrrr: too reliant on her dogs, feels terrible into anyone who can oneshot them
[2:21:30] bdjoe: Q sucks gotta do two just to have damage
[2:21:31] mux_______: I kind of hate corki, not for any particular gameplay reason- I just don't like the vibes
[2:21:33] jeweledwasp: I don't think there's any issue. She's an assassin she can't have a Q be a long range skill shot or that'd change her purpose entirely.
[2:21:33] best_eboy_na: @Rose06012 oh nicee PeepoCozy
[2:21:38] minipixiee: @Poweradi i heard she was a main dps of her own but ngl im still hoping she's good with kafka bcuz i love her ulti animarion
[2:21:39] reytai: why do you play champions you dont like? do you enjoy trash talking them?
[2:21:41] Jerkreb: also W range thing is weird, just give it better range
[2:21:42] Lucentex: her and briar coming out close together and kinda feeling really similar turns me off the both of them
[2:21:44] towbean: dawg v dawg
[2:21:59] Shadic54321: they did too much w her
[2:22:00] ChadingoYitten: her dogs can cs tho thats op
[2:22:03] Rose06012: i am here looking for my awammers but i dont see them modCheck
[2:22:08] ChadingoYitten: PEKW
[2:22:11] snorkalex: Black Swan is a dps that wants Kafka because Kafka triples Black Swan's damage by simply using skill/ult
[2:22:20] loverseyes: she has no escape too
[2:22:23] snorkalex: Any dot dps gets giga buffed by Kafka existing
[2:22:25] FormattaX: @lucentex speak for yourself buddy. I'm just as turned on for nafiri as I am for briar  pekinW
[2:22:31] ChadingoYitten: @snorkalex but they made swan ult bonus dmg not work with kafka proc Smoge
[2:22:38] ChadingoYitten: OMEGALOOOOL
[2:22:43] shmichaelbyers: ad champion
[2:22:44] danteyrrr: her ult reset feels bad when you still have cooldowns so you just run around with a shield
[2:22:45] ChadingoYitten: stay
[2:22:46] oliwolli11: like a dog?
[2:22:46] shmichaelbyers: auto attack ez
[2:22:47] ChadingoYitten: good girl
[2:22:48] loverseyes: sit  like a good dog
[2:22:48] Multipogopuschel: you sit like a good boi Gladge
[2:22:49] FormattaX: off brand talon
[2:22:50] LaserFlamingo: good girl
[2:22:52] r1c3_cak3: sit like a good dawg
[2:22:52] reytai: can e be dodged? i always die against nafiri
[2:22:54] Jerkreb: they should put naafiri Q on an ammo system
[2:22:55] Noeliosis: SIT peepoSitPride
[2:23:02] snorkalex: @snorkalex Yeah but Kafka still procs all of her Arcana stacks its still tons of damage
[2:23:08] ChadingoYitten: they should give her E two charges but only if u hit the 1st one
[2:23:09] jeweledwasp: Nobody likes to fight against Zed tho he's perma nerfed. Not a great example.
[2:23:10] Poweradi: tons of damage classic
[2:23:11] oliwolli11: they need to make more ad assassins that can 1 shot you
[2:23:11] CreoA: i feel assassins have to be quick and she feels so slow
[2:23:17] FormattaX: talon just feels like a much more smoother experience of Nafiri
[2:23:17] jeweledwasp: They don't want a Zed 2.0
[2:23:19] loverseyes: getting bullied by a coki feels bad
[2:23:26] chucklel: that’s why galio sucks to play sometimes. you e in and use ur spells and then u just stand there waiting for cooldowns
[2:23:28] snorkalex: @snorkalex Also wdym swan ult makes them take 25% more damage why wouldkafka not work on that?
[2:23:32] teamtenderheart: hi pekin i missed you
[2:23:33] Noeliosis: i have a guarantee im saving for acheron plinkbedge
[2:23:48] Poweradi: @Noeliosis drip marketing just dropped for her Pog
[2:23:49] Kinkou_Order: Aloo
[2:23:52] Byrn_22: @jeweledwasp the point isnt who is balanced. its who feels good to play, which zed does.
[2:23:54] Rose06012: please dont fix naafiri i havent played in a long time but i cant play against her
[2:23:57] fgringau: wasnt corki dead?
[2:24:01] DontFeedPenguins: could have killed him after he used e
[2:24:03] Noeliosis: @Poweradi Evilowo
[2:24:03] ChadingoYitten: @snorkalex it only works on the dot proc on enemy turns, not any other proc sajj
[2:24:04] donkeyconsumer: her cs feels so awkward to
[2:24:07] Kinkou_Order: @ACUTE1o1 waaa

[2:24:33] snorkalex: @ChadingoYitten Nah Kafka procs Arcana stacks, she just doesn't get the def shred in BS's talent
[2:24:37] oliwolli11: that lands?
[2:24:40] MikaAwoo: Furret
[2:24:45] Noeliosis: @Poweradi WAIT SHES NIHILITY OOOBANG
[2:24:47] best_eboy_na: Furret
[2:24:50] ChadingoYitten: ohh thats what i meant, the def shred :33
[2:24:51] Poweradi: @Noeliosis YESSSS
[2:24:56] ChadingoYitten: i thought it was tied to ult
[2:25:02] loverseyes: not the tickle damage :(
[2:25:12] jkattan: The fact that Corki can outdamage someone says everything
[2:25:14] fgringau: omg
[2:25:17] bonesbrittle: xdd
[2:25:18] Kinkou_Order: @Noeliosis nihility = good YesYes
[2:25:19] fgringau: was a buffer q?
[2:25:22] ChadingoYitten: POVPekinGotGankedandStartsComparingJunglers
[2:25:22] snorkalex: The def ignore is in Black Swan's talent, and that only counts when the Arcana actually procs. But Kafka gets the other stuff
[2:25:31] oliwolli11: lmao i was about to say voli isnt gonna gank but kha will
[2:25:34] poisonpink26: its jover
[2:25:36] Rose06012: @snorkalex what are these words you speak

[4:27:35] cheehencleekier: what’s the bug?
[4:27:35] CovenLilith: I thought they considered it "intended" ?
[4:27:40] fgringau: i feel like its a feature
[4:27:46] Shadic54321: that dumb af if intended
[4:27:46] 19yruj: thats not a bug
[4:27:49] edengardenz: that's not a bug
[4:27:50] AyameNH: W + back, then move (only you)
[4:27:55] Silver_Mane: Silver_Mane subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[4:27:58] AyameNH: Your clone keep backing
[4:28:00] 19yruj: im pretty sure its just how its meant to be
[4:28:10] troutyo: Chatting "it's a feature" *neeko clone emoting while moving and lasting 3x longer than intended
[4:28:21] pisht: i mean if i could close myself i could also control it independently of myself
[4:28:21] 19yruj: didn't a rioter say it was intentional?
[4:28:22] lordllizar: leblanc can move her clone. so
[4:28:22] savor_the_flavor: its not real
[4:28:26] AyameNH: With enough haste you can have 2 clones backing haha
[4:28:28] fgringau: cuz RIOT

[4:28:46] Mullsha: Man stream is acting weird... Yall hear crying? Kappa pls don't timeout tis joke ily I sorry
[4:28:46] edengardenz: cuz phlox (rioter who did the midscope) likes her being able to move and emote
[4:28:47] AntonyTLK1: What employes are gonna do that? There arent any left at RIOT
[4:28:49] troutyo: @lordllizar can leblanc move her clone while it is emoting?
[4:28:50] nowel_son: Be clearer mister streamer
[4:28:52] lordllizar: same d ifference is what im saying. emote or not, leblanc can, why not neeko
[4:28:53] hoozooh: Clones have basic human rights they can move
[4:29:04] CovenLilith: Yeah the issue isn't that the clone can move, or that the clone can back.  The issue is that it can move while doing stuff that's supposed to be stationary
[4:29:04] trunnpet: i'm so horny i'll die if i don't get bred right now (i'm a female ferret)
[4:29:14] GodSlim7: didnt riot esports say it was a bug abuse and people still do it in pro and no punish

[4:29:48] spacewerreier: just never play adc
[4:29:56] AyameNH: FIGHT URGOT

[4:30:03] bentorofl: @trunnpet lux stop avoiding ur time out
[4:30:15] august_winds: i thought you meant the clone finishing the recall/emote animation mb
[4:30:24] august_winds: not moving while doing it
[4:30:31] edengardenz: the rioter who did neeko midscope likes her being able to move and emote, that's why that's a thing
[4:30:33] kabramaldita: No u!

[4:30:51] gaelcete: pekinPISSED

[4:31:55] Shadic54321: it blocks projectiles
[4:31:56] Astryiah: if it’s moving while emoting it just reveals the clone. idk I don’t see the issue. it’s more of an issue that emoting extends the clones lifespan
[4:32:00] AyameNH: It's easier to missclick the clone
