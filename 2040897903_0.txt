[0:18:00] kncttv: that was hottt
[0:18:02] StreamElements: ShakeandbakeAK just tipped $4.20 Do you feel like theres too many op champs now though to ban.  If its not senna its varus, aatrox, seraphine, fizz, hwei.  one tricks just gotta accept facing one of those every single game :(.
[0:18:21] JakeBJackson: lourMao
[0:18:28] Kaazea: imagine if 2 bans per person
[0:18:41] Kaazea: theres over 160 champs now

[0:19:01] ApacheTomcat: tft style
[0:19:04] AlecoGereco: if anything im sure riot would want to make champ select shorter not longer
[0:19:06] popper729: what if we just go back to blind pick?
[0:19:14] kncttv: bans are for beta players let people play what they want or are you guys not good enough to win vs counter? lol couldnt be me gg tho
[0:19:48] Misled_Leones: @soyeontv baseg

[0:21:24] DamnShizzelDieDizzel: Cant you reposte his ult?
[0:21:47] ShakeandbakeAK: she ulted
[0:22:25] ellipticalmalcontent: op champs are typically (outside of senna rn) at most 2-3% higher winrate, and that means out of 100 games the fact they picked that champ only matters in 2 or 3 of them. I feel like the focus on op champs is way overblown to their actual impact.

[3:14:23] piggietheone: lourlo a reddit comment on poppy passive the mechanic behind it is that it will always bounce off the target and land between you and the closest opponent (in a way creating equal distance : P->s = E->s, to allow counterplay by walking over the shield); it will however prioritize drop locations closest to walls to create an advantage for poppy to smack the enemy into a wall if an enemy goes for the shield.
