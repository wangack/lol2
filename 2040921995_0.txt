[0:08:32] imainleesin: wait what happeneed
[0:08:32] pasak1987: probably not this season, but next season will be brutal
[0:08:42] nfcpm: why
[0:09:02] nfcpm: they seemed to sal esports was a focus for them
[0:09:10] SamsClubWorker: i was on youtube but man this stream is running so late that i need switched platforms
[0:09:12] pasak1987: mass layoff announcement from riot, most likely impacting e sports related department, rather than game dev
[0:09:32] ImGriffon: @pasak1987 ...and how do you conclude this
[0:09:45] Hybrid_BDP: i thought their release said it was only affecting riot forge and runterra for the most part
[0:09:47] urgotabekidding: Given the changes with shorter between game times etc they can probably cut the whole desk and just use an interviewer and casters.
[0:09:53] pasak1987: thats what i got from reading their announcement
[0:10:06] ImGriffon: i dont think you read it
[0:10:14] pasak1987: i did…
[0:10:15] travisgafford: There were layoffs at LCS btw
[0:10:16] bustlinfungus: @Hybrid_BDP so far its effecting people from all over the company
[0:10:20] bustlinfungus: it doesnt seem localized
[0:10:24] nfcpm: yeah it seems from the announcement it wont impact esports but in game dev
[0:10:25] GreenCervidae: @Hybrid_BDP announcement did say that, yes, but it is definitely impacting more than just that
[0:10:28] oatcows: palafox waiting room
[0:10:31] bustlinfungus: theres a post on the league subreddit that has a list of people publically announcing theyve been laid off

[0:10:36] SillyLittle_Guy_: I thought it was mainly LoR, art and story people outside of Riot's core games

[0:11:12] nfcpm: LOL, valerant etc. were mentioned to have more focus moving forward
[0:11:20] pasak1987: they are starting to cut non-core things, and because season has already started, eSports scene is fine for this time around…but it would see some impact later on
[0:11:21] travisgafford: thanks @LooterJoe and @ThexCatmanx and @horizoncasts

[0:12:19] fullnrgy: It has to be quality work though, not just an mmo
[0:12:25] renmaidar: @pasak1987 There were multiple people across multiple esports games in riot that were cut
[0:12:32] pasak1987: hope that mmo actually materializes…dont want that to be a vaporware.
[0:12:37] nfcpm: most tech companies had significant cuts last year into this year. it is the year of efficiency. companies over hired during covid

[0:30:36] ArkSoftware: some people who worked on TFT were affected too
[0:30:40] NhatN: FeelsBadMan
[0:30:53] Azqato: layoffs are a great step towards profitability. look at how well it helped meta and google stock last year
[0:30:57] the1andonlycorbin: sad to hear for all those laid off
[0:31:13] ThatWafflefoot: I am straight PISSED about these layoffs
[0:31:32] Fredthefree: I think it was a massive failure since 1 year ago they cut 56 jobs and basically promised no more job cuts
[0:31:39] imainleesin: Do the layoffs have to do with buying out GGs and EG? they had to make some money back?
[0:32:00] urgotabekidding: buyouts a drop in the bucket compared to 500 salaries
[0:32:04] pasak1987: they took thur job :((
[0:32:06] trollinn69: layoffs always suck ass but they do happen I don’t necessarily take it as a bad sign for riot
[0:32:18] hurrbadurr: Their severance package for the people that were cut looked pretty good, so while it sucks, hopefully that helps them out
[0:32:19] ThatWafflefoot: @imainleesin They wouldn't need to layoff 11% of the company to make that buyback
[0:32:25] Azqato: @imainleesin good point
[0:32:32] aequorin628: I think the layoffs are because of the China gaming laws hitting Tencent really hard
[0:32:36] Andres_di_Burg: @the_sergm They are getting at least 6 months severance -- anyone who has any tangible skills and who hasn't been phoning it in will be better off on the other side of things, and they have the benefit of an unprecedented cushion. 6 months severance is an incredibly gift that most people who are laid off don't get.
[0:32:43] eliaswrites: what’s up gamers what did I miss?
[0:32:43] imainleesin: @ThatWafflefoot true, but it could be abit of a factor
[0:32:48] Giftyyy: as a HR prof, I read the letter and the severance package and  I thought it was very generous.
[0:32:51] aequorin628: Tencent no long in their infinite money era
[0:32:56] NathalexSan: The curious thing about this is that everyone had the same chance of being laid off, from artists to corporate
[0:32:58] hoodlum_mack: !discord
[0:32:58] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[0:33:05] thevegemiteking: I'll counter, hiring them in the first place was irresponsible
[0:33:05] nfcpm: if Riot didn't have those failed projects would all the people have been hired to begin with?
[0:33:21] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[0:33:43] Thiccnuggie: haha i can definitely relate to that one!
[0:33:58] the_sergm: @Andres_di_Burg Yeah their severance package is straight up the best I have seen over the past year, but it´s still very painful to see, and both the people going through it and the ones that were not affected must be struggling
[0:34:06] DukedURL: ded game stop whining
[0:34:22] nfcpm: @thevegemiteking that is usually the best policy at top companies.
[0:34:34] imainleesin: LUL

[0:34:56] imainleesin: pass the copium bro
[0:34:59] Sscyc: just joined, what's happening?
[0:35:13] thevegemiteking: @nfcpm yer hire irresponsible when doing well then cut them the second it drops
[0:35:18] eliaswrites: I mean. for 7 years I had glowing reviews and I got laid off today with no possibility to improve from any perceived mistakes. don’t think it’s black and white that I became useless
[0:35:29] VerbalHorse: C9 is best western team this year atleast, EU looks poopoo
[0:35:58] nfcpm: being laid off is not about your performance. it's company performance
[0:35:58] Giftyyy: @nfcpm Amazon only did 3 mons severance
[0:36:04] Hypernova749: lore is gone rip
[0:36:14] the_sergm: @VerbalHorse Are we wathing the same EU? I see a pretty decent step up on middle-of-the-table teams
[0:36:17] MamasCupcakes: i cant figure this out, says i dont have an account . ill just take my view elsewhere
[0:36:25] Andres_di_Burg: @nfcpm I don't understand why people don't get this
[0:36:37] Useless_BM: then u became a powerful genius
[0:36:38] Zachary_Blobman: Could Palafox give an example of intentional practice in SoloQ or Scrims?
[0:36:39] shuotime: those with jobs will understand, but – if you can't spam the same number of hours of practice as eastern teams, being intentional in practice is the only way to keep up
[0:36:40] MamasCupcakes: im at like 50 months
[0:36:51] Aura16: Powerful Genius 🙏
[0:37:13] VerbalHorse: @the_sergm lol

[0:43:45] urgotabekidding: Revenge/licorice for example
[0:43:46] Useless_BM: revenge and licorice need teams asap
[0:43:47] kamikazplatypus: honestly the scheduling for the 2nd day of games were a bunch of like "expected to win" vs "expected to lose" teams

[0:51:11] elter_ago: Make it a gamba
[0:51:15] LP_Phnx327: mid innovation - picking anything besides corki azir ori
[0:51:18] dropsofliquid: It has so far though
[0:51:19] urgotabekidding: we're already into azir corki meta...yay?

[0:51:48] garritwithani: hextec award

[0:52:52] rininlol: the mad scientist of the week award would work
[0:52:57] dropsofliquid: or a patch ahead?
[0:52:59] Zachary_Blobman: Zac might be strongest midgame teamfight champ in the game.
[0:53:03] Thiccnuggie: trailblazer award is not awful
[0:53:10] GreenCervidae: if they're still working there Sadge
[0:53:17] phinvincible: PLEASE THE FONT Prayge
[0:53:31] nfcpm: pauses give you time to poop
[0:53:33] TheRealDivert: inb4 palafox stream title "faker copied my pick to win the lck"
[0:53:35] the1andonlycorbin: that was a fun video
[0:53:41] dropsofliquid: That video was way better than I expected. Jojo getting QVC was hilarious
[0:53:42] Palafox: @TheRealDivert lmfao thats a good one
[0:53:49] rininlol: travis make lcs pros play magic lol
[0:53:53] garritwithani: lcs needs a KitKat pause sponsor like lec

[0:55:17] Veers1: I love you palafox
[0:55:17] rininlol: palafox when u gonna play magic with travis?
[0:55:19] treethan__: Join Threads
[0:55:19] dropsofliquid: Where does traffic even come from though? I miss so much content now I think
[0:55:20] Voxtrik: nah but i pick tgaff video and they counterpick r/lol subreddit how can i play
[0:55:21] Deuxblem: The League reddit mod are one of then most pathethic beings out there thats why
[0:55:22] BalloonHorses: Ask Mr Beast
[0:55:22] azztomouth69420: who asked lil bro
[0:55:28] GreenCervidae: i couldn't believe none of them knew how to put a fuckin cassette in a tape player man
[0:55:31] Fredthefree: Have you thought of posting short clips from vids to tiktok?
[0:55:36] SourEggs: change titles as well
[0:55:36] desemaia: only good subreddit is lookmaxing
[0:55:40] JinnAxel: I think the video is good to put as a short
[0:55:46] epicalbawler: league reddit mods are evil
[0:55:47] Deuxblem: The League reddit mods are one of the most pathethic beings out there, thats why
[0:55:49] dropsofliquid: @greencervidae it was top comedy though
[0:55:53] Fredthefree: I HATE THE POLICY
[0:55:58] GreenCervidae: @dropsofliquid for sure
[0:56:04] BalloonHorses: reddit mods in general are odd people lol. No offense to reddit mods
[0:56:11] epicalbawler: lol reddit mods are legit power grabbing freakoid
[0:56:13] BalloonHorses: i mean sort of full offense
[0:56:14] Azqato: need to post on other subreddots
[0:56:14] oatcows: the fans like ur cardigan cristian
[0:56:21] nfcpm: does the person running twitch chat for LCS work on other stuff during the broadcast? Because they missed a bunch of stuff on Sunday
[0:56:25] brocollo: who is moderating that subreddit anyways?
[0:56:25] treethan__: just make your own subreddit
[0:56:32] Thiccnuggie: that Reddit <insert anything subjective> is crap from what i can tell
[0:56:46] Mojokkal8: powertrips from a reddit mod whats new
[0:56:53] Azqato: true we need a TGI subreddit
[0:56:55] Fredthefree: I bet Riot stopped paying the mods LOL
[0:56:58] Yasukeh: Thankfully the LoL sub has had comparatively less relevance on the space over time. Every time a big story doesn't show up there, it makes the sub become less valuable as a news aggregator.
[0:57:03] Voxtrik: @Palafox looking cute i like ur cardigan
[0:57:05] ArkhamAvalon: is this just the r/leagueoflegends subreddit?
[0:57:07] ayyitsabe: ayyitsabe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:57:13] dropsofliquid: Same. I used to get all my content from there 🫠
[0:57:28] Palafox: @Voxtrik thank u @oatcows got it or me
[0:57:29] Azqato: someone clip this and post it on reddit
[0:57:33] kamikazplatypus: I remember when the sub was ACTUAL content, its just all text articles now and the occasional like personal unedited gameplay clip that slips through :/
[0:57:35] mori_gami: dunkey videos Sadie
[0:57:40] Fredthefree: remember when you could post sick play? peepoSad
[0:57:40] elter_ago: Is YouTube really the answer?
[0:57:41] mumbIer: esports and people complaining about x item or champ
[0:57:42] Voxtrik: @oatcows basiilCLAP
[0:57:42] Yasukeh: The lol sub is overwhelmingly anti content creator. Used to always find great people there 10 years ago.
[0:57:43] xHorza: its esports and complaining
[0:57:46] oatcows: loltinBundoru
[0:57:46] urgotabekidding: I stopped participating in the match threads or PMTs because I get that fix on discord
[0:57:48] elter_ago: Or is there something better?
[0:57:48] epicalbawler: someone capable needs to make a new lol subreddit thats more liberal in its policy
[0:58:01] oatcows: @Voxtrik loltinHug
[0:58:05] Deuxblem: Remember they stopped moderating for a day at april fool? For once i thought it maded the subreddit better , with banger meme and shit
[0:58:10] bizdgil: Will Palafox continue after this season no matter what?
[0:58:11] dropsofliquid: But it also means that content maybe gets less eyeballs

[0:58:35] Relise_lol: 2 games woo
[0:58:39] The_Blaze83: BO2 BO2!
[0:58:46] nizzy2k11: they played 3 last split
[0:58:49] KSnOwnage: He used to play more games in academy and challenger last year, that's why
[0:58:49] urgotabekidding: I liked 3 days/week a lot
[0:58:55] boba_bunbun: bo1s suck
[0:59:00] brocollo: it felt weirdly short this weekend, especially with 3 days of lec
[0:59:03] evan_pogchamp: it is really silly though how little your time actually matters as a pro
[0:59:05] VerbalHorse: APA is like 19 tho right? Can't blame him
[0:59:05] Yasukeh: People have just gotten used to other leagues doing things differently and don't see the same in LCS.
[0:59:06] Thiccnuggie: bo7 fearless when?
[0:59:11] garritwithani: 4 games vs 5 feels really strange though
[0:59:16] kerokerogrips: bo1's suck for coming to conclusions for teams and gauging gameplay
[0:59:16] dropsofliquid: it felt real short this weekend though
[0:59:21] nizzy2k11: @Thiccnuggie im sold
[0:59:21] evan_pogchamp: like all of that grind just for the outcome to be one game a day is silly
[0:59:22] nfcpm: Cubby is ok with even numbers
[0:59:27] Azikielboi: xdd
[0:59:27] VerbalHorse: People just want BO3's tbh
[0:59:27] xxSirlancealotx: best 16/31 LUL
[0:59:43] KSnOwnage: @cubbyxx academy plays more games, that's the difference for APA
[0:59:52] nizzy2k11: wasn't it mark who said stage games don't matter when you play so many scrims?
[0:59:53] HippoSquirrel: I'd be happy with a triple round robin
[0:59:54] numiiigoesrawrz: take: APA tweet saying he plays 14+ hours a day to only play 2 LCS games per week, bo2 or bo3 format for LCS? https://twitter.com/alwaysplanahea1/status/1749554217143132346
[0:59:54] xHorza: I think it feels worse this season cause there are less overall games
[0:59:55] aroshta: thursday thru sunday 2 bo3s each week
[0:59:58] someknown: I think the problem is the BO3s dont have the viewership
[1:00:06] nfcpm: maybe if he won his 2 games he'd feel different
[1:00:06] yunjinrin: @verbalhorse 21
[1:00:14] VerbalHorse: 2 weeks off in February, all of APril off
[1:00:15] bowenchung: in track sports, people train for months to compete for 10 sec or 5 min
[1:00:18] j_tripper: tell mark to stop being a coward and give bo3 fearless draft
[1:00:21] saltedapplesiv: the league doesnt have viewership. might as well full send
[1:00:26] C0NFLO: why not triple round robin with only 8 teams?
[1:00:30] 1twenty3: that 2 week break is gonna be rough..
[1:00:31] imainleesin: the 2 week break just seems awful lol
[1:00:32] nizzy2k11: no triple round robin was a mistake
[1:00:34] thevegemiteking: @someknown we have viewership now?
[1:00:37] VerbalHorse: May only for MSI teams otherwise teams that lose in playoffs have like 3 months off
[1:00:42] dropsofliquid: That break is gonna blow
[1:00:43] urgotabekidding: @imainleesin its to get around valorant I think
[1:00:48] Thiccnuggie: they do be selling the "every game matters" angle tho
[1:00:52] nfcpm: @Connor_CB won't that mess us side selection
[1:00:55] kerokerogrips: LEC had a giga break and it killed all hype
[1:00:57] Yasukeh: People will forget LCS is still going on. LEC was really bad with the break last year.
[1:01:02] matthew0zz: break is gonna be bad for veiwership
[1:01:10] dropsofliquid: I completely stopped watching LEC during their one break & never caught up all year
[1:01:11] EzrealAuditore1: Not quite the same thing but Imagine training years for the Olympics only to complain that you get one shot
[1:01:17] Deuxblem: why did riot stop making Allstar event?
[1:01:20] rininlol: we just need 2 splits before msi
[1:01:27] rininlol: like lec
[1:01:28] VerbalHorse: Why doesn;t Riot build a little wooden shack for LCS games?
[1:01:31] C0NFLO: @nfcpm maybe havent really thought it through just want more games!
[1:01:35] kamikazplatypus: Usually without the walkout there is a 1 week break around 4th of July because there's just not great ways around it
[1:01:36] VerbalHorse: So there's no conflict with VCS
[1:01:38] dropsofliquid: @yasukeh that’s exactly what happened to me with LEC last year.
[1:01:53] pausechamp52: is that palafox
[1:01:58] Palafox: no
[1:02:05] vulocity: @pausechamp52 palafaker susge
[1:02:07] insertname87: palafak
[1:02:10] ATwistedFate: it literally is 3 weeks lol why are people calling it 2
[1:02:11] oblivs: the genius?
[1:02:18] pausechamp52: monkaS oh shit hes real
[1:02:20] epicalbawler: 3 week break is a complete disaster
[1:02:21] oatcows: funny genius
[1:02:25] gurg7: same spring playoffs as last uear
[1:02:28] gurg7: year*
[1:02:30] VerbalHorse: Yea 6 out 8 make it you literallyneed like 4 wins to get into playoffs
[1:02:35] kamikazplatypus: Its also crazy because its only a 6 week season, so the games are back to back to back, and the we go from 11th of feb being end of week 4, to Mar 2nd being start of week 5
[1:02:39] GreenCervidae: i mean we can just skip to playoffs now and exclude dig and immortals tho right
[1:02:43] brocollo: its a lot more volatile though
[1:02:47] sallyzar: I have met him in a scrimmage, and my opponent, midfielder Palafox, is powerful and seems like a genius.
[1:02:52] pausechamp52: burberry cardigan palafox is rich Pog
[1:02:53] imainleesin: its clearly dig and imt not making playoffs
[1:03:01] the1andonlycorbin: hope they can fill in that break with some content on the LCS channel or something for people to stay engaged
[1:03:01] nfcpm: i have become a believer in Cubby's 2 game idea
[1:03:04] oblivs: sore throat, hoarseness?
[1:03:10] BillGunn: @GreenCervidae DIG slander
[1:03:15] VerbalHorse: LEC 3 days a week feels really fun
[1:03:24] VerbalHorse: Wish LCS had 3 days a week
[1:03:29] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:03:33] Yasukeh: good one
[1:03:36] kamikazplatypus: its the difference between bo3 and bo2 all over again, NA fans just cant accept ties! Kappa @Cubbyxx
[1:03:49] Deuxblem: and why is that
[1:03:49] Avvura: with 8 teams i'd wish for at least triple round robin
[1:03:54] ArkhamAvalon: Bo3 is so much better
[1:03:57] nfcpm: wait isin't LEC best of 1?
[1:03:59] peepeedoc: better yet: bo3 of bo3s
[1:04:00] gurg7: BO7 see u there
[1:04:05] phinvincible: gib bo3 Madge
[1:04:06] nizzy2k11: LCK dying financially.
[1:04:06] Syctris: LEC is bo1
[1:04:10] malord11: can you tell palafox im a shy pooper also we are in this together
[1:04:15] Palafox: XD
[1:04:17] thevegemiteking: even bo2
[1:04:22] yami545: lol palafox's shit eating grin when Travis mentioned Bo5
[1:04:23] JohrDinh: Spring BO1, Summer BO3, easy
[1:04:25] Prophet181: KEKW
[1:04:26] Yasukeh: LEC is single round robin bo1 mainly for seeding into a much more robust playoffs
[1:04:26] VerbalHorse: @Syctris He meant only BO1, LEC is BO3 second round
[1:04:30] dropsofliquid: 2027 bo3 at 1am Mondays. 15k of us tune in
[1:04:31] ThexCatmanx: BO3 with 8 teams can be done on Saturdays and Sundays
[1:04:34] Cubbyxx: @malord11 I think this was the shit eating grin @yami545
[1:04:35] evan_pogchamp: Best of 3 isn't going to happen because it's more expensive lol
[1:04:49] yami545: Bo3 are goated I loved the 3 game weeks
[1:04:49] evan_pogchamp: all about the bottom line at this point in LCS's lifecycle
[1:04:50] juan_juario: A good problem to have for sure
[1:04:53] imainleesin: the prerecorded champ select is kinda odd
[1:04:55] urgotabekidding: Its nice to end the day early...should move back start by at least 30 mins to stop overlapping with LEC
[1:05:02] Useless_BM: with internationals being more best of i want best of in lcs
[1:05:03] nizzy2k11: fuck that, the 10 game tiebreaker day was the best day ever
[1:05:03] rininlol: best of two or 3 days a week like lec
[1:05:12] desemaia: problem is there is legit only 1 great team, and 2 decent teams. rest are just bad
[1:05:13] Azikielboi: we need to have more games between good teams
[1:05:13] Deuxblem: the long lcs intro montage vid was such a banger
[1:05:17] GreenCervidae: BOOMERAAAAANG
[1:05:19] Azikielboi: more playoffs less regular season
[1:05:23] Yasukeh: Same concept as wanting to always selling out a venue. Better to have 3k fans sold out vs 7k in a 10k arena
[1:05:27] yami545: I mean just do what LEC did with Bo3 for like 3 weeks
[1:05:40] dropsofliquid: @desemaia LEC has a bunch of maybe bad teams pulling big viewership still
[1:05:42] aequorin628: If we reduce the league to 2 teams every game would be a banger 5head
[1:05:43] stevethesleeve1: stevethesleeve1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:05:46] Azikielboi: i was so hyped to watch NRG c9, idgaf about IMT asleep at the wheel
[1:05:47] VerbalHorse: @yami545 This, just copy lEC format it's better than BO1
[1:05:55] imainleesin: IMT vs DIG Aware
[1:05:57] Azikielboi: thats the reality for a lot of fans honestly
[1:05:58] urgotabekidding: I don't see LCS viewership really improving sadly
[1:05:59] Useless_BM: almost all of international play is best of series
[1:06:08] Thiccnuggie: has LCS considered making the players topless and investing in the "implied nudity" meta?
[1:06:09] Useless_BM: 2.5 rounds of swiss
[1:06:10] quintincrusher: I don't listen to anyone, don't worry! They won't fool me
[1:06:12] desemaia: @dropsofliquid idc about lec really, just know that EG and GG leaving means way more bad games each day
[1:06:13] Useless_BM: is the only bo1
[1:06:15] SevTST: Does the LCS have more turnover than LEC?
[1:06:18] GreenCervidae: kinda based idea @Cubbyxx
[1:06:18] garritwithani: so lec
[1:06:19] peepeedoc: Bo3 where if it goes to 3rd game its 5 Teemos vs 5 Nunus
[1:06:20] Ian7j2: No one say best of 2 cubby is here

[1:06:25] Deuxblem: who did the lcs promo video? That guy must stay
[1:06:29] brocollo: elaborate game of rock paper scissor to determine worlds teams?
[1:06:32] Azikielboi: @desemaia yeah idk why this is danced around lol
[1:06:32] dropsofliquid: I’m just saying team quality doesn’t seem to drive viewership
[1:06:36] JohrDinh: Quicker to just watch 3-4 LoL podcasts, can stay up on all the regions in a fraction of the time:P
[1:06:37] evan_pogchamp: @urgotabekidding nobody young plays League in North America, any product needs new viewers to survive
[1:06:39] kamikazplatypus: all im saying is last split when NA did its best its done in a WHILE at worlds was because our players played 3 games a week into an 8 team playoff, sound like we have no choice but to do that forever KEKHeim @travisgafford
[1:06:57] Azikielboi: @dropsofliquid it does tho, only in the LEC does it not, but in every other region it does
[1:07:05] AugGod: Its not really a viewership take, its more how do we make the LCs the best product possible
[1:07:07] Useless_BM: single rr bo3 doesnt rly add that many games
[1:07:12] travisgafford: @kamikazplatypus also the split we did the best in a WHILE was when we had a player walkout, maybe we should have player walkouts every split!
[1:07:12] Azikielboi: even in the LEC it does, just nationalism ALSO works
[1:07:22] urgotabekidding: STOP DRAFTING LUCIAN.  Lucian is 0-11 between LCS and LEC
[1:07:33] kamikazplatypus: @travisgafford sounds like if the goal is winning at worlds we have no choice Hhhehehe
[1:07:58] VerbalHorse: Some people play 14 hours a day and play 0 LCS games
[1:07:58] Azikielboi: @kamikazplatypus more games doesnt make us play better, but better games does, less non-competitive teams is important
[1:08:06] JohrDinh: Good take
[1:08:07] Relise_lol: YES PLEASE STREAM PLAYERS
[1:08:07] insertname87: @urgotabekidding berserker could
[1:08:11] gibson8686: gibson6Q gibson6Q gibson6Q gibson6Dd gibson6Dd gibson6Dd
[1:08:11] desemaia: @Azikielboi LEC is living off being able to pull from big niche viewership. we dont have that in NA
[1:08:12] dropsofliquid: His streams are fun too. He & Yeon bicker like brothers
[1:08:15] Andyyybarton: pretty based
[1:08:18] joeysaphira: yeah he streamed for a few hours
[1:08:18] boba_bunbun: yes
[1:08:19] xHorza: he did finally
[1:08:21] nfcpm: how much practice do NFL players play for 1 game a week?
[1:08:21] epicalbawler: palafox do u stream at all
[1:08:22] nizzy2k11: C9 made him do it
[1:08:24] Deuxblem: backthen it was the players themselves that built audience and riot picked up on it
[1:08:24] coin1: i love vulcan streams
[1:08:24] Useless_BM: he did for like 3 hrs
[1:08:24] dropsofliquid: Yeon & Umti have been streaming too
[1:08:25] GreenCervidae: where palafox stream then Stare
[1:08:26] Prophet181: Jojo stream was fun
[1:08:28] peepeedoc: i saw a similar tweet from Fudge but it was more like 14 hours a week
[1:08:29] Lyghtsaber: blaber has streamed infintely more than he ever has in the last few months
[1:08:29] Cloud9: he finally did it
[1:08:32] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport | Alienware: http://alienware.com/travis
[1:08:39] nizzy2k11: @Cloud9 called it
[1:08:47] dropsofliquid: They hosted Yeon yesterday which was cool
[1:08:50] someknown: @travisgafford @Palafox do you know if player contracts prevent them from playing in any other tournaments?  What if the players coordinated mid week scrims on tournament realm that they treat like a real match
[1:08:52] nfcpm: Jensen streamed a few times
[1:08:55] ArkSoftware: he said he was gonna stream yesterday :(
[1:08:56] dropsofliquid: or raided idk the words
[1:09:00] Azikielboi: @desemaia thats not the whole story, their better teams get better viewership outside KC and MAD. Vitality for example gets way less viewers
[1:09:02] Cloud9: no stream, no food
[1:09:04] Cloud9: it's simple
[1:09:05] kamikazplatypus: @Azikielboi I'm mostly being facetious haha, realistically format implication on performance is pretty minimal since the teams play SO MUCH MORE in scrims, that ultimately is the major decider over things
[1:09:06] hyper_camm: Riot needs to give more tools and freedoms for tournament realm for third party tournaments so that demand for serious practice is always met without them having to constantly invest
[1:09:13] JohrDinh: When was the last time pro players would make up the top row on Twitch
[1:09:13] Hypernova749: @Cloud9 ayo
[1:09:13] Fredthefree: NACL raided Jojo, which was cool
[1:09:13] ArkSoftware: @Cloud9 ty
[1:09:16] evan_pogchamp: Streams are great but I'm not sure they bring in any new fans unfortunately
[1:09:17] xXInsertCoyneXx: @Cloud9 100%
[1:09:20] urgotabekidding: lol I love @Cloud9
[1:09:23] evan_pogchamp: great for existing fans though
[1:09:24] someknown: YES third party tournaments
[1:09:25] Mortryx: I hate seeing stacked CQ games and not a single player is streaming it
[1:09:28] VerbalHorse: Yeah teams not elveraging their players for more social media views is bad for btoh parties
[1:09:31] Dewmrik: it used to be in everyone's contracts and then they were written out of them because players complained about it
[1:09:38] VerbalHorse: Streaming helps both layers and the org
[1:09:43] TheRealDivert: Did we decide if LCS is a competitive product or a entertainment product?
[1:09:47] dropsofliquid: Totally agree. Streams make you fans of players which makes you want to watch LCS
[1:09:50] kamikazplatypus: whats the point of NACL happening after LCS if they are just hosting LCS Player streams LMAO
[1:09:52] ArkhamAvalon: I like APA's stream but he needs an audio guy to look at his stream setup(where's Joe at) bogaLUL
[1:09:53] peepeedoc: peak LCS was Sneaky and Meteos C9 days; those streams were lit AF
[1:09:55] juan_juario: TL and C9 guys have been streaming a bunch
[1:09:58] xXInsertCoyneXx: xXInsertCoyneXx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:10:00] Cubbyxx: @kamikazplatypus Why I have mixed feelings
[1:10:01] urgotabekidding: I mean...streaming is how some of these people will make money once LCS dies
[1:10:01] Useless_BM: palafox why is ur channel last live 1 year ago smh
[1:10:02] brocollo: i mean there are players that i have 0 interaction with outside of games except for the rare interview
[1:10:04] malord11: I gotta ask Palafox when you poop are you a inward guy or outward, me personally im inward
[1:10:06] the1andonlycorbin: Even if the players don't say much, it is still fun for fans to watch their favorite players in games and connect with them a bit more
[1:10:13] dropsofliquid: @arkhamavalon you don’t like his breathing ASMR?!
[1:10:16] Palafox: @Useless_BM i got more of a life
[1:10:21] JohrDinh: Was def better when streamers were basically the pros in LCS
[1:10:40] KSnOwnage: @kamikazplatypus have to keep the LCS alive before NACL
[1:10:40] Useless_BM: @palafox fucking porn stars in LA smh my head
[1:10:42] thauleris: SoTL is what brought me to LoL back in the day!
[1:10:49] pausechamp52: @Palafox why dont you play zed?
[1:10:57] peepeedoc: palafox whats your go to karaoke song? I bet its Girls Just Wanna Have Fun
[1:10:58] Fredthefree: when they were making hundreds of thousands, it's more worthwhile to practice than stream
[1:11:00] WokkaS: goat?
[1:11:01] thauleris: came from SC2 SOTG!
[1:11:09] kamikazplatypus: @KSnOwnage but then we could just run NACL in other time slots yknow, i dont think its great to play that late when its a remote league and many players are in EST/CST time zones and stuff
[1:11:15] oatcows: what are you naming the goat
[1:11:20] someknown: But look at what double said, he has to give up so much to play versus stream.  It is hard to be married to two partners demanding all of your time
[1:11:24] imainleesin: DL on SoTL "Korea will always be a year behind"
[1:11:30] tmptd: if the game play is better more would watch though
[1:11:30] Palafox: @peepeedoc i should have sang that FR mine is paramore - still into you
[1:11:38] dropsofliquid: I watch to cheer on Impact 😎
[1:11:39] boba_bunbun: i wanna root for jojopyun
[1:11:39] Deuxblem: my favorite players was doublelift feelsbad man
[1:11:43] yami545: I watch for nrg playera
[1:11:44] Useless_BM: BASED
[1:11:45] nerfcapitalism: @imainleesin that was like 50 years ago man
[1:11:54] boba_bunbun: and i wake up at 7am to watch c9 ;_;
[1:11:59] peepeedoc: @Palafox solid; mine is always Mr Brightside. Impossible for people to not go fucking ham
[1:12:00] Yasukeh: People still have more of a connection with players from 10 years ago than current players.
[1:12:00] epicalbawler: riot needs to allow bottom up growth
[1:12:02] Relise_lol: my favourite players are bjerg, spica and revenge :)
[1:12:05] quintincrusher: or the franchises. Brand loyalty matters equally imo. TSM leaving and there being TSM chants at events is brutal for the league.
[1:12:06] ArkhamAvalon: @peepeedoc cap22Poggies paramore lets gooooo
[1:12:09] epicalbawler: nobody wants to watch lol in nfl format
[1:12:10] Cloud9: @boba_bunbun <3
[1:12:11] Fudgenator: I watch for the NA talent
[1:12:12] kaboos101: When since have we had a character as big as dyrus and his pillow
[1:12:14] Colaja953: just give us a mr beast video with lcs players as contestants EZ popularity
[1:12:27] yami545: I actually love a lot of personalities this year
[1:12:27] BreakingDreams: Watching meteos and Sneaky banter all day on streams and videos is what got me into league. Nowdays I dont have a fav
[1:12:33] android51__: I remember those times where I needed to see C9 win to be hyped for rival matches. I dont see much of that now imo
[1:12:35] yami545: even imt
[1:12:36] carelesssssss: lmao
[1:12:47] peepeedoc: @BreakingDreams 10000%
[1:12:47] GreenCervidae: @Yasukeh this is the exact reason i put my take in the discord that lcs needs to reach out to these players and try to get them interested in starting up their own teams
[1:12:50] the1andonlycorbin: agree @yami545
[1:12:56] hellohihi145: WHY IS NO ONE STREAMING CQ I WANNA SEE IMPACT VS TL
[1:13:00] desemaia: LCS needs someone like loltyler1 to save it. imagine all the testestorone fueled creatine sniffing fans spamming bigbrother in the twitch chat
[1:13:02] numiiigoesrawrz: he always says the full name.....
[1:13:04] urgotabekidding: Its hard to be a good streamer tho. Most pros just play with minimal interaction
[1:13:07] Cloud9: @android51__ missing that C9 x TSM rivalry
[1:13:11] ArkSoftware: @numiiigoesrawrz ikr?
[1:13:12] hyper_camm: Riot has to make it easier for third party events to have a professional look and feel and avoid taking any cuts or granting permissions every time because it stifles the entire scene and makes solo Q the main source of subpar practice
[1:13:17] treethan__: YOOOOO JERSEEEY
[1:13:17] peepeedoc: Watching Sneaky and Meteos stream got me through 30 hour overnight call shifts for 5 years
[1:13:18] dropsofliquid: @hellohihi145 right now?
[1:13:20] wimpy91: I’m curious how often the LCS starts on the divisional weekend of the playoffs - I stopped watching Saturday and Sunday because of the football games going on - I know i can’t be the only other sports fan who watches - so I’m curious how much that effects it
[1:13:22] nfcpm: cubby is going to stream CQ after this
[1:13:23] brocollo: at least 50% of why i watch lcs is because of captain flowers ngl
[1:13:30] PenguinBuddy15: @numiiigoesrawrz as he should
[1:13:30] Cubbyxx: @nfcpm true
[1:13:35] urgotabekidding: @peepeedoc residency sucks
[1:13:41] j_tripper: that was a really good segment
[1:13:41] malord11: Yo palafox give us a NRG palafox signed shirt giveaway give us some fan engagement
[1:13:54] android51__: @android51__ YES! You wont believe how many times a close friend of mine and I drove to LCS just trash talking before the matches </3 I miss them.
[1:13:54] karatemoose: Travis sounds so scorned lately haha
[1:13:57] Yasukeh: Dignitas should hire imaqtpie in the same way Fnatic should hire Xpeke as a brand ambassador. C9 getting Hai and Meteos back in some capacity should be the standard.
[1:13:58] peepeedoc: @urgotabekidding truth
[1:14:02] numiiigoesrawrz: take: LCS needs more content like jatt's 15 minute discussion after sunday's show to help players express themselves
[1:14:08] JohrDinh: How many LoL podcasts are there now like 40?
[1:14:09] travisgafford: @karatemoose because I didn't get that job after applying for it 12 times
[1:14:10] Useless_BM: LEC did that for pgl with 3 supports
[1:14:11] rippy575: rippy575 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:14:16] Useless_BM: genius
[1:14:20] nfcpm: i liked bwipo's post game interview
[1:14:23] GreenCervidae: @karatemoose KEKW
[1:14:24] s0manythings: Fuck yea!!!!
[1:14:28] dropsofliquid: wait what job
[1:14:39] ixbx: @karatemoose KEKW
[1:14:43] treethan__: Please dear god I need a take on the teams gameplay
[1:14:44] someknown: Wish travis was doing this.....
[1:14:50] treethan__: any team
[1:14:50] deekomode: KEKW
[1:14:53] xXInsertCoyneXx: LUL
[1:14:54] Crawlsballs31: what did LEC do to get there viewership to jump back in the day
[1:14:55] treethan__: Id even accept Immortals
[1:14:57] insertname87: LCS should feature jensen streaming
[1:15:00] Thiccnuggie: We love you Travis
[1:15:01] Mortryx: LUL
[1:15:02] Hack377: The fact that they picked Jensen was so smart too. Having someone to say spicy stuff for their first time doing it was great
[1:15:03] treethan__: Palafox is on I want gameplay analysis ahhhh
[1:15:03] Aura16: LUL
[1:15:06] Andyyybarton: LUL
[1:15:12] dropsofliquid: Ya I’m lost tbh
[1:15:18] desemaia: @treethan__ u new here?
[1:15:19] nfcpm: wait is it really a joke?
[1:15:25] saltedapplesiv: my grandparents told me about state of the league
[1:15:27] MuddyKippy: I miss SotL peepoSad
[1:15:30] thauleris: shout out to SOTG JP
[1:15:32] Deuxblem: @insertname87 where? Like in the league client?
[1:15:33] treethan__: @desemaia yes very new actually 2 days ago whats good
[1:15:38] leagueofemily: i'm late did anyone ask my question? :3
[1:15:40] kamikazplatypus: I miss SotLTravis, but almost as much as I miss SC2 Esports... @travisgafford
[1:15:45] Cubbyxx: Not yet @leagueofemily
[1:15:54] Avvura: :3
[1:16:02] phinvincible: I bet Shakarez felt the same way when he saw some of those games travis LUL
[1:16:09] Fredthefree: When is Travis getting royalties?
[1:16:14] Lyghtsaber: royalties
[1:16:24] desemaia: you should drive a truck travis, a cybertruck. this will help you the most in life
[1:16:25] Azqato: if that content does well travis can be hired as the host ;)
[1:16:35] ArkhamAvalon: did ya see LEC do State of the League instead of PGL as well today?
[1:16:40] hoodlum_mack: The banter between Jensen and Exyu was great
[1:16:41] MarstonX: esports and chill comeback please
[1:16:49] Relise_lol: it needs to be a weekly hour long podcast on podcast apps
[1:16:54] ENV187: @leagueofemily just finished the first making the rounds episode, very good stuff. look forward for more from you and Kelsey
[1:16:55] magregs: Meteos needs to be the host
[1:16:56] VerbalHorse: Get a talker like Bwipo on there and it'll be fire
[1:16:59] Useless_BM: its similar to LEC’s PGL
[1:17:06] THEcodybauman: Get your tuckus in the discord, emily!! #TeamEmily
[1:17:15] Hack377: Lag and Jensen talking about Korean imports
[1:17:16] Useless_BM: jensen also flamed the random koreans
[1:17:18] GreenCervidae: them talking about KR imports was also so so so so good for the league IMO
[1:17:20] nfcpm: yeah when Jensen was talking about playing Bwipo 1v1 after champs select vs reality
[1:17:42] thauleris: I loved SoTG sooo much, lookup highlights from iNcontroL for what they could be...
[1:17:52] desemaia: @VerbalHorse no thanks. Bwipo is a radio with no off button. if there is a mute button on his mic then ok
[1:18:29] ArkhamAvalon: @VerbalHorse bwipo is the goat spooknRage
[1:18:29] lec_airport_speedrun: SR WildTurtle hates THIS about CaptainFlowers????

[1:18:31] numiiigoesrawrz: i advertised it more by myself 🙃
[1:18:33] insertname87: @Deuxblem yeah, on stage, LUL
[1:18:52] kamikazplatypus: They literally are shutting down all the Riot Forge stuff, but like I don't EVER remember seeing the Song of Nunu game promoted in the client or anywhere outside of twitter/youtube trailers and stuff, riot marketing is BRUTAL @travisgafford
[1:18:54] hoodlum_mack: Biggest loss on the weekend was that there was no joke about "Catching up with DL" during the big pause on Saturday... WHILE he was on the cast
[1:18:56] hoodlum_mack: Smh
[1:18:59] someknown: why would they not advertise this more?
[1:19:07] Relise_lol: they just announced it 1 week before luckily a rioter leaked it to me so i could plan and buy a ticket for that day
[1:19:12] desemaia: Can LCS change the format so that only the good teams play eachother.
[1:19:13] malord11: Travis or Palafox leak the afterparty lcs dates I need to go for the free food and maybe a picture
[1:19:23] someknown: @kamikazplatypus right?!

[1:19:28] Palafox: @malord11 even i have no clue
[1:19:35] GreenCervidae: chat question on the topic of riot marketing: has anyone EVER seen an ad for league in NA? anywhere? tv, sidebar ads, youtube ads? ANYTHING?
[1:19:37] imainleesin: lmao i remember that
[1:19:42] xHorza: @kamikazplatypus i was just thinking about this earlier, how hard would it be to promote these games in the riot client? I literally had no idea there were more indie games made after the ruined king one
[1:19:46] kamikazplatypus: SCUMBAG JATT, THE GREATEST ANIME BETRAYAL OF ALL TIME, FLEXXING HIS DUAL CITIZENSHIP
[1:19:46] Prophet181: it was during WCG games and he played for two different international teams
[1:19:46] leagueofemily: yeah he does
[1:19:51] Fudgenator: scumbag JATT KEKW
[1:19:51] Reggie3000: they forced another Bo3 ? was that it?
[1:19:52] leagueofemily: he's done it bts on the lounge
[1:19:54] JinnAxel: @esportsjatt confirm or deny
[1:19:56] Konnoke: WCG
[1:19:57] leagueofemily: he can still do it
[1:20:04] cultLeader_: lul
[1:20:08] deekomode: om
[1:20:08] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:20:14] WokkaS: KEKW
[1:20:17] phinvincible: KEKW actual good one
[1:20:21] Mortryx: LUL 󠀀
[1:20:26] imainleesin: CHICKSDIGELO yesss
[1:20:30] GreenCervidae: WCG was that with the eagle??? the pigeon????
[1:20:31] Relise_lol: they do dig elo
[1:20:34] urgotabekidding: But chicks do dig elo...don't they?
[1:20:35] Deuxblem: @travisgafford In the Client , just after                                     ''Play button- Home - TFT'', there should be a ''Content'' tab and features proplayer streams, video content , interviews etc
[1:20:35] Fredthefree: CHICKS DO DIG ELO
[1:20:37] kamikazplatypus: back when you could name yourself "nydushermain" LuL
[1:20:39] TheRealDivert: Are you saying chicks dont dig elo? mind blown
[1:20:44] Fredthefree: scumbag jatt
[1:20:48] ObsidianSludge: oh yes the scumbat jatt times
[1:20:50] coolcat2228: how could cubby forget IEN san jose
[1:21:00] Cubbyxx: Hey it was the one thing NA won for awhile
[1:21:07] LP_Phnx327: i'm old, i remember watching this live
[1:21:08] Cubbyxx: Also IEM San Jose wasn't really that competitive let's be real
[1:21:17] imainleesin: man i wanna watch all those old dreamhack clips now
[1:21:23] urgotabekidding: BUUUUURN
[1:21:53] ArkhamAvalon: iem san jose was a trip. Kikis TF Jungle, TSM winning something internationally... bogaLUL
[1:21:56] gurg7: week before and first week pros have a ton of content
[1:22:02] gurg7: hero shoot, asset days etc
[1:22:09] Cubbyxx: @ArkhamAvalon TSM won a different tournament and that was super legit
[1:22:16] kamikazplatypus: shoutout the good ole 120 min call time we had before 🙃
[1:22:23] xxSirlancealotx: @imainleesin they are more than likely on youtube still. i know i found phreak's first casting one not to long ago
[1:22:28] shewasabulldozer: when does TSM play?
[1:22:31] 0lympius_: It might be too nerdy and niche, but I would totally watch Post Match Interviews with the coaches, a la traditional sports
[1:22:31] coin1: tsm is back POGGERS
[1:22:40] android51__: @GreenCervidae nah, to be fair though, I never really see any advertisement for gaming in the US. Except that Diablo 4 billboard in NYC on launch. that was a good meme
[1:22:42] ImmortalScrub: @leagueofemily any chance we'll see you host an episode of Pros?
[1:22:54] the1andonlycorbin: that would be an interesting piece of content
[1:22:55] leagueofemily: @ImmortalScrub possibly :3
[1:22:56] TheDixieCup: palafox rocks, feedback breeds growth
[1:23:07] Fredthefree: Like a comedy central roast,
[1:23:09] Muzvein: Bring Eyla and Vulcan on that show
[1:23:09] brocollo: i cant even imagine corejj being rudely honest
[1:23:10] xxSirlancealotx: @shewasabulldozer on the 32nd
[1:23:17] GreenCervidae: @GreenCervidae hmmmm that's fair, i'm not sure i've seen gaming ads either now that i think about it!
[1:23:20] PapaSmithy: I'm late, but shoutout to Jensen making a big effort to instigate and make waves rather than coasting on his following
[1:23:28] PapaSmithy: guy 1v9'ing content game
[1:23:31] Useless_BM: banger
[1:23:36] EzrealAuditore1: What about trying to get @travisgafford to guest host one of the episodes so you can get in on it?
[1:23:36] urgotabekidding: Where's Zven the content king?
[1:23:46] Bluejay1344: @PapaSmithy sotlYes
[1:23:49] leagueofemily: @PapaSmithy Jensen in content is pog
[1:23:50] dropsofliquid: Jensen low key always brings some hype to content
[1:23:53] ArkhamAvalon: @ArkhamAvalon oh u right. I was thinking of a different iem lol.
[1:24:16] GreenCervidae: jensen eating the banana was the best part of the season intro vid
[1:24:21] Palafox: @TheDixieCup it was initially corejjs idea~ the feedback from everyone was hella valuable
[1:24:24] nfcpm: i though Jensen did a great job showing he is a person, not just a player
[1:24:34] Thiccnuggie: pals with palafox
[1:25:09] urgotabekidding: naaaah saltyrun back FTW

[1:29:02] urgotabekidding: Emily with some real rage behind the question haha
[1:29:04] Useless_BM: azir does everything u want out of a mid
[1:29:05] boba_bunbun: when faker stops playing azir
[1:29:08] nfcpm: Jensen says he'll keep picking him unless he is banned
[1:29:08] numiiigoesrawrz: take: Emily Rand talking about Azir vs corki meta. azir warps midlane meta - what does it take for LCS teams to not play azir anymore
[1:29:08] Thiccnuggie: AD LB was cooking Azir
[1:29:12] EzrealAuditore1: @EzrealAuditore1 The size isn't the problem so much as the aspect ratio
[1:29:17] LP_Phnx327: On hit change is big
[1:29:23] Hypernova749: @boba_bunbun REAL ASF
[1:29:26] j_tripper: jojo said just about anything can be played mid, true or false
[1:29:27] ArkhamAvalon: how does Azir Lich Bane work? LUL

[1:31:30] Deuxblem: thats another thing , some champions have been proplay staple for so many years watching the matchups again and again is fucking boring
[1:31:33] enshero: Alienware link?
[1:31:39] chloeredtea: i slap around diamond azir players with taliyah. why isn't palafox simply doing this against lcs players?

[1:33:41] wejustplayed: @travisgafford your camera's been funky all night friend
[1:33:41] urgotabekidding: need more funky drafts. Makes games more interesting
[1:33:52] a_blue_snivy: i blame not lanes

[1:33:57] Darkarmist: !discord
[1:33:59] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[1:34:12] enshero: Monitor recommendations?
[1:34:37] urgotabekidding: The problem with trying to innovate in the LCS is that if a non-standard pick loses people blame the pick without looking at the rest of the game and context
[1:35:04] cowhiz: cowhiz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:35:08] TheRealDivert: will we see more innovative picks or more default safe picks
[1:35:14] urgotabekidding: wheras if you pick some shit meta pick and lose no one cares: lucian being 0-11 between LCS and LEC for example
[1:35:30] nfcpm: yes
[1:35:33] ImmortalScrub: @enshero anything from Alienware poggers
[1:35:45] Deuxblem: @urgotabekidding cause league players are some of the most metasheep players
[1:35:52] travisgafford: @wejustplayed in what way? I don't see it being weird on my end at all
[1:35:54] Zachary_Blobman: the whole team has to learn how to play around a new pick
[1:35:56] fishee: fishee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:36:07] urgotabekidding: @travisgafford weird lines on your lamp in the background
[1:36:22] wejustplayed: @travisgafford the light behind you is like weirdly "wavy"? and your picture is making you look super washed out
[1:36:25] urgotabekidding: that's better
[1:36:33] Deuxblem: trueee
[1:36:40] CloacaQueen: @wejustplayed not 256 fps PunOko
[1:36:46] robsiipopsii: Idk it feels like players pick the same champs because they know they'll always be meta in some way and putting time into a Champ that's maybe only useful for one patch could be risky
[1:36:53] mojica100: Palafox
[1:36:53] epicalbawler: @Palafox thoughts on FBI abusing the supp item?
[1:36:53] GotTheDooms: I think NA will be slow to innovate, at least at first. From interviews it seems like a lot NA waited on other regions
[1:37:07] Palafox: @epicalbawler SMART TO ABUSE ITEMS thats apart of the game
[1:37:15] Deuxblem: @GotTheDooms been like that since s1
[1:37:18] nfcpm: the best will be if they dont adapt they lose. then some challenger player can replace them
[1:37:29] boba_bunbun: at least people will talk more abt lcs then
[1:37:35] JinnAxel: The Renekton effect
[1:37:36] ThexCatmanx: AD TF gonna be big on the new patch?
[1:37:43] iEnigmaaa: Palafox answering questions on call AND in chat, Pog
[1:37:43] GreenCervidae: its okay travis you can say morello's/liandry's/renekton
[1:37:44] urgotabekidding: The biggest potential concern is bugs
[1:37:48] mojica100: iiviiojica10 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Love holiness league
[1:37:52] iEnigmaaa: Common Palafaker W
[1:37:57] nfcpm: didn't this happen when Doublelift was on TL but couldn't play Senna or such when it was meta
[1:38:02] brocollo: @Palafox in the same logic why not bully your opponents to ff in allchat?
[1:38:11] Zachary_Blobman: reckon flyQ will end up 1st cause of innovation. inspired + bwipo vry open minded and smart bout the game
[1:38:19] urgotabekidding: CQ also now has 50 ping
[1:38:26] BalloonHorses: Champions queue is full of players from amateur teams, really makes it sorta boring to watch
[1:38:28] dropsofliquid: The voice made it more fun to watch too
[1:38:40] urgotabekidding: I loved watching CQ with voice comms.

[1:39:02] Rezoahc: I thought the CQ population is good rn. Is this not true?
[1:39:03] Cyanteal: Those pesky Riot stats
[1:39:06] NihilistGamer1: real and true
[1:39:06] TheRealDivert: wait, did LCS go back to the weekend?
[1:39:11] PapaSmithy: #ad
[1:39:12] GreenCervidae: making the rounds WOOOOO
[1:39:12] Palafox: @TheRealDivert yesy yes yes yes
[1:39:12] cliffDOTsun: yesssss LCS BACK BABY can we just talk about how weirdly good doublelift's voice is for casting? I was so pleasantly surprised
[1:39:17] Lyghtsaber: so league players are lucky to be able to be on a team of 5 players since they can't exist in vc with a pool of 100 people
[1:39:24] bowenchung: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100

[1:39:41] nizzy2k11: travis getting shafted by 2 podcasts this year.
[1:39:49] the1andonlycorbin: well done LCS team
[1:39:53] cliffDOTsun: @urgotabekidding his suit was really mid...but its okay hes a gamer...
[1:40:02] dropsofliquid: @nakrim I think Kelsey’s twitch channel
[1:40:12] urgotabekidding: @cliffDOTsun and he didn't even swear once
[1:40:13] writingwithrod: I'm a Gamer.
[1:40:14] NahDawgDatAintMe: What I'm hearing is MarkZ is 1v9
[1:40:21] NihilistGamer1: Was there any of the on-air talent that got laid off?
[1:40:24] Deuxblem: she sounded like Emliy
[1:40:26] cliffDOTsun: his colour commentary was like actually really interesting
[1:40:28] CloacaQueen: @cliffDOTsun the bar is in hell but he looked the most dapper we've ever seen him

[1:40:35] Gingmire: Gingmire subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 37 months!

[1:40:48] robsiipopsii: Damn those layoffs hitting the gaming industry everywhere its sad to see
[1:40:49] cliffDOTsun: @CloacaQueen lmao one of these days he gotta hit me up to take him suit shopping
[1:40:51] CloacaQueen: @cliffDOTsun costreams are the same when not full of chaos
[1:40:56] Zachary_Blobman: lcs was good this weekend. but scoreboard font annoying to read
[1:41:02] dropsofliquid: Or how the 0 in the gold diff font looks like an 8 😁
[1:41:03] leagueofemily: right now making the rounds is just on Kelsey's Twitch and YT
[1:41:05] nfcpm: show looked great
[1:41:24] Darkarmist: I hope we see some singed in pro play or brand jungle :(
[1:41:31] cliffDOTsun: I just didnt expect it, like he always seemed so awkward before i just assumed he would be when casting, but again...plesantly surprised
[1:41:44] epicalbawler: how low can viewership go for the product to be viable for riot to continue to produce?
[1:41:52] CloacaQueen: @leagueofemily is my goat, was super cool to take a pic with you last split!

[1:44:50] brocollo: do you guys have to do doping tests (for stimulants for example)?
[1:44:59] Hack377: Love it when you have players on as guests Travis. Always gives very cool insight
[1:45:30] cliffDOTsun: lololol ok so just a quarter of your hair
[1:45:45] nfcpm: I appreciated when Palafox said in the Travis interview playing solo queue and playing more is his job.
[1:45:59] android51__: So what im taking from all this is the NA scene isnt improving due to a lack of motivation to improve competitively? im prob off base
[1:46:45] VerbalHorse: Faker won worlds one tricking Azir
[1:46:50] JohrDinh: Jojo with Bjergsen flexing would be great
[1:46:52] VerbalHorse: Champ pool overrated
[1:47:20] boba_bunbun: keria champ pool <3
[1:47:29] Deuxblem: @VerbalHorse Calling Faker a onetrick is not it
[1:47:32] JohrDinh: You look at the game from more points of view
[1:47:45] PalavenLoL: Palafox top lane when?
[1:47:53] PantherShakaZulu: @android51__ It's not just that. Everybody in other regions plays different. We in NA take the game way less serious, but spend the same amount of time on the game.
[1:48:02] boba_bunbun: wouldnt bo3s bring out more drafting reads -> small champ pools exposed

[1:57:21] liftliftenjoyer: travis' attitude is so annoying
[1:57:24] cliffDOTsun: they needed to ride the tru damage spanish hiphop thing harder...cause they coulda rode this wave up
[1:57:25] P4llace: Palafox, are you talking about instalok?
[1:57:25] leagueofemily: @PalavenLoL honestly i have no control/knowledge of it, there were times that it also felt to me after draft was complete but idk what the onstage process is, sorry
[1:57:28] Wildbeats1: Remember when creators were in the client? Good times
[1:57:40] wejustplayed: @travisgafford @Palafox  honestly it feels like all the content you are thinking should belong on the league subreddit is now living on the mains subreddits instead cuz that's where you can go to joke around and see cool stuff
[1:57:43] robsiipopsii: Or UberDanger ans Donkey when they still played league
[1:57:49] wejustplayed: (at least on the subreddits i check every so often)
[1:57:58] PalavenLoL: @leagueofemily fairygirlFairyflower  ty for answer

[1:58:13] nizzy2k11: most of the modern lol content is a shadow of the 2012 content.
[1:58:13] Fredthefree: I can't find them
[1:58:17] Lokrakil: even just step 2 though of turning the millions of league players into viewers by having a place with a better balance
[1:58:19] Cubbyxx: @android51__ These were bangers
[1:58:21] Fredthefree: Youtube doesn't really push it on me

[1:58:27] leagueofemily: there's no aggregate like reddit for that content anymore and that's more on how social media platforms have evolved imo
[1:58:30] PantherShakaZulu: @android51__ A name we trust
[1:58:34] JohrDinh: Ive just never clicked thru from reddit, I go the long way
[1:58:36] someknown: I think right now the hard time is finding new content creators.  To me there are the staples I enjoy but many have stopped creating content, and nothing seems to take to me
[1:58:39] Azqato: there are more subreddits than the official league one
[1:58:51] ThaGovna: wher eis /all chat at?
[1:58:52] leagueofemily: i think there's a lot on tiktok that you wouldn't see unless your tiktok algorithm is attuned to it
[1:58:57] cliffDOTsun: lol goodbye nsfw reddit
[1:59:03] Azqato: i see lots of content from reddit feed, not the subreddit
[1:59:03] Fredthefree: Maybe put more effort into the discord?

[1:59:39] drahciranidem: Drop a coin to your content creator, oh lcs Fandom, oh lcs Fandom, oh yeah oh yeah heyyoh
[1:59:41] PantherShakaZulu: LoL subreddit was run by jack asses as I remember. Complete unethical asshats.
[1:59:49] Fredthefree: tiktok to youtube to tiktok and back and forth
[1:59:51] sigmaballs2: i agree with palafox, alot of players got into the league community through reddit
[2:00:39] ThaGovna: I can't even find any VODs for NA Challengers on Youtube...
[2:00:40] leagueofemily: ngl though i too used to be a reddit gremlin in s2 and it really increased my want to continue playing league and get into esports
[2:00:44] Cubbyxx: @ThaGovna :)
[2:00:47] cliffDOTsun: >.> are we sposed to be doing that for youtube?
[2:00:48] cliffDOTsun: damn...

[2:00:50] Cubbyxx: I've been told that's a work in progress
[2:01:04] nizzy2k11: i miss PTL lol
[2:01:17] Azqato: travis actually making a great point here
[2:01:24] Azqato: we need better SEO
[2:01:25] ThaGovna: I really hope so, they hype for Fearless draft and I can't watch it if I don't watch it live
[2:01:30] ggIzento: Watch time from Reddit sucks as well. Titles also perform very different from Reddit vs Youtube.
[2:01:40] Cubbyxx: @ThaGovna It's in the VoDs on twitch for twtv/lcs_challengers
[2:01:46] someknown: I wish the LOL esports website had a page dedicated to pro streamers and their content.
[2:01:47] brocollo: alternative name for that youtube video: "I MADE LCS BE BACK ON WEEKEND (SHOCKING REACTION)"
[2:02:02] robsiipopsii: Ye he has a clips channel
[2:02:03] boba_bunbun: caedrel
[2:02:08] Azqato: tyler1 and xqc clips
[2:02:11] xog21: tiktok is also a really good way of growing an audience, lcs should honestly be investing in tiktok more
[2:02:19] liftliftenjoyer: @brocollo LMAO EXACTLY
[2:02:21] boba_bunbun: o//
[2:02:26] coin1: xdd
[2:02:26] trollinn69: need to appeal to zoomers they don’t use reddit
[2:02:26] mithrilblue: Riot really alienated their biggest content creators away from LCS
[2:02:27] 0lympius_: Do we need an NA version of Caedrel?
[2:02:31] ThaGovna: TY @Cubbyxx <3
[2:02:37] LSF_Frog: @0lympius_ xqc
[2:02:37] xHorza: having things like funny moments from the broadcast posted in shorts format would be cool
[2:02:50] Azqato: @0lympius_ thats sneaky meteos and DL
[2:02:57] nizzy2k11: does anyone remember those mockumentaries Riot Lazerbeams did?
[2:03:00] jlowe22: team liquid dropped a video that got 130k views I thought it was good but how did it get the traffic? 130k is much more than their average right
[2:03:01] BalloonHorses: What LCS needs is new era breaking point movie
[2:03:02] Lokrakil: dhokla and poome skydiving with dash was great
[2:03:08] liftliftenjoyer: youtube is dogshit tho, ads every 2 minutes on every monetized video. useless website these days
[2:03:09] Lyghtsaber: YEP
[2:03:13] Mattias_Kz: @0lympius_ Yes
[2:03:20] the1andonlycorbin: yeah we need a main content page with everything curated from the LCS, content creators, media, etc.
[2:03:22] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx

[2:03:39] travisgafford: @jlowe22 good title and thumbnail and then very engaging video
[2:03:44] travisgafford: the triple whammy
[2:03:47] robsiipopsii: Wasn't there also like a content piece from the lcs where someone visited the gaming houses of the teams but only did it like two times in 5 years?
[2:03:54] ThaGovna: @liftliftenjoyer may be dogshit, but people under 30 eat it up, including myself
[2:04:24] Cloud9: ew
[2:04:29] ArkSoftware: lol
[2:04:34] KSnOwnage: VCT DansGame
[2:04:34] Fredthefree: @jlowe22 also the bait on twitter
[2:04:34] someknown: @RobiChaaan there were a few houses, and the content was great imo, but wonder what the numbers were because id guess they would do it more if the numbers were there
[2:04:43] spudrat_: @jlowe22 what about the thumbnail is good?  seems pretty standard to me (if thats what u mean for 'good' then sure)
[2:04:44] BalloonHorses: @Cloud9 hi cloud 9
[2:04:45] nocturnavi: hahaha did not expect zellsis to get a shoutout on HLL
[2:04:49] nfcpm: Did Markz ever get back to any about streaming those tier 3 games?
[2:04:52] PapaSmithy: monkaS

[2:06:33] robsiipopsii: @thagovna at least TheDive is still really cool
[2:06:39] numiiigoesrawrz: take: the recent gaming layoffs as a whole seem to be ramping up and are leaning more towards contracting roles, which will harm the industry and will have PR crisis
[2:06:46] GreenCervidae: AI going to destroy video games, don't buy into it.
[2:07:00] VerbalHorse: Damn bro's laying out the 10 year long term projections for the gaming industry ona macro economic level
[2:07:13] PantherShakaZulu: AI IS GOING TO TAKE PRO GAMER JOBS!!!
[2:07:14] ThaGovna: @RobiChaaan you're not wrong. I also enjoyed the content with Jatt and the 3 pros. That was fun. But I liked the stuff that was less esports focused, and more community based focused
[2:07:22] VerbalHorse: Thought this was about the LCS
[2:07:45] Mattias_Kz: A good AI video game is still a good video game
[2:07:53] nfcpm: You could also say laying people off makes the companies more healthy and able to focus on esports that are profitable vs. those that just suck money
[2:08:06] MYNEWDUMGAME: Zzzzzzzzz
[2:08:11] robsiipopsii: @thagovna yeah you are right but I take any content I can currently

[2:09:47] VerbalHorse: There is so little LCS bumper content, pls someone make game recaps or big play highlights or anything
[2:09:53] VerbalHorse: There's like 2 shows that talk about LCS
[2:10:08] robsiipopsii: @ixbx Whiskey drunk flowers casting would be insane
[2:10:11] imainleesin: yeah the no desk content is alittle scary tbh
[2:10:13] PantherShakaZulu: AI is gonna be casting cpu games to viewer bots in 2025. :*(
[2:10:24] ImmortalScrub: Losing on air time of Jatt Raz and Emily is honestly the worst part of the broadcast changes
[2:10:31] Azikielboi: dropping emily would haev been comeptitive for stupidest decision ever with dropping dash by lcs
[2:11:03] Azqato: why have there been no takes about first week of lcs so far?
[2:11:14] narvuntien: The Job market sucks
[2:11:17] travisgafford: @Azqato did you try and give one?
[2:11:18] Mattias_Kz: @azqato Agreed
[2:11:22] Azikielboi: @Azqato because no one is invested Aware
[2:11:25] travisgafford: @Mattias_Kz did you
[2:11:31] Lyghtsaber: @narvuntien it is very down bad rn
[2:12:00] narvuntien: I feel like too much of it is automated, so they have AI scan your resume for qualifications and keywords and if you don't have them you get kicked off
[2:12:08] imainleesin: @Azqato true....
[2:12:14] Sscyc: that's a product of playing MTG
[2:12:19] GreenCervidae: @narvuntien this is 3000000000% correct
[2:12:20] Sscyc: been that way for 25 years
[2:12:25] PantherShakaZulu: @narvuntien Layoffs everywhere right now. Every industry is going through it.
[2:12:28] robsiipopsii: @narvuntien but that's nothing New that came with ai no?
[2:12:47] narvuntien: no person actually reads your resume to see what your actual skills and background is
[2:13:03] bowenchung: @travisgafford and @cubbyxx thank you for continuing to create content on YouTube and doing Hotline League given the esports winter. really admire your commitment and passion for LCS / NACL.
[2:13:04] trollinn69: most industries way overspent during Covid and are now cutting back
[2:13:15] nfcpm: yup
[2:13:27] karlheinzstockfootage: 0% loans left, so has the vc money funnel
[2:13:28] ThaGovna: @bowenchung THIS
[2:13:34] VerbalHorse: They're saving 4 mil a year on those two teams now
[2:13:42] PogoStomp: @narvuntien this is completely dependent on what job you're looking for.  The more competition there is for the position the less time they are going to spend looking at and individual resume
[2:13:51] Bluejay1344: uh oh
[2:13:53] Jeankof: oh no
[2:13:55] numiiigoesrawrz: spring finals when 😭 and where 😭

[2:14:16] Lyghtsaber: rip bozo type beat
[2:14:17] ThaGovna: I went to spring and summer last year and loved it
[2:14:20] nizzy2k11: tell me newark was not the last LCS roadshow, what a shit way to go out in fucking newark.
[2:14:23] cliffDOTsun: tbh as a casual fan did not know any of this was happening
[2:14:24] narvuntien: okay so my experience is I have a PhD in nanotechnology but I can't get a lab tech role because I don't have a cert IV in laboratory techniques. A qualification I would automatically achieve if I was willing to pay someoen for it
[2:14:28] numiiigoesrawrz: this is even more of an effort for us to watch LCS - we need people watching and buying products
[2:14:31] Mattias_Kz: @j_tripper as a LEC watcher - first time?
[2:14:33] LSF_Frog: rip league. Time to switch to Palworld
[2:14:34] ThaGovna: i was hoping for another road trip, even if still on west coast
[2:14:37] robsiipopsii: Man take me back to 2014 NotLikeThis
[2:14:38] Cubbyxx: @nizzy2k11 Knowing you're from Jersey makes this so much funnier
[2:14:43] Deuxblem: all industry based on the internet eventually fails because the internet grow as its own rate , its own world. And  those industry get caught up in their own shit but the internet move way faster
[2:14:55] cliffDOTsun: from an outside point of view i keep coming back to league as an esport...and it seems like its the only game holding onto a healthy sports scene
[2:14:57] Thiccnuggie: podcasts are being stolen.
[2:14:58] trollinn69: doing worlds in the LEC studio was writing on the wall
[2:14:59] kerokerogrips: esports was a zero interest rate phenomenon
[2:15:00] HippoSquirrel: Palafox is like "Are all the episodes of HLL this depressing?"
[2:15:00] nfcpm: which is better a road show or an analyst? if you cut more people they could do it.
[2:15:12] shroomfive: lol
[2:15:18] Lyghtsaber: "me play game"
[2:15:23] j_tripper: @mattias_kz I stopped watching lec early last year, this was one of the reasons
[2:15:24] karlheinzstockfootage: @kerokerogrips thia.

[2:16:58] Azikielboi: wtf man
[2:16:59] Sifuginsaing: Hey Palafox, how fast can you run an all out, balls to the wall mile?
[2:17:03] 1PoundLife: how was the viewership this weekend?
[2:17:03] VerbalHorse: Just shrink in size and regrow
[2:17:20] cliffDOTsun: some of these jersey's just suck...and are hard to buy >_>
[2:17:20] VerbalHorse: Globally LoL is popping off, last worlds biggest yet
[2:17:24] MBR4Life2: I wish there were more ways to see them beyond finals
[2:17:25] ImmortalScrub: @lokrakil my ping playing in Chicago is 3ms. Talk about high quality soloqueue
[2:17:37] Jeankof: if we loose roadshows it'll be a real shame to think the last 2 were in raleigh and newark LUL
[2:17:38] spudrat_: the doom and gloom talk legit drives the community narrative way too hard, gotta treat this stuf with respect like league is sick as fuck
[2:17:40] numiiigoesrawrz: crypto arena travis*
[2:17:40] Cloud9: can't believe we're all watching C9 win worlds this year
[2:17:42] Cubbyxx: When I lived in Chicago I had 19 ping, coming out here to 55 was depressing
[2:17:45] ixbx: @VerbalHorse exactly! thats why we're doing worlds this year in LEC studio
[2:17:46] Cubbyxx: I don't play Cait anymore XD
[2:17:47] ThaGovna: @cliffDOTsun You're not wrong... and the price jump... PHEW

[2:19:24] vlogfinity: IMT
[2:19:25] Mortryx: @Cloud9 IMT
[2:19:26] Azikielboi: @Cloud9 we would all lose
[2:19:28] Lokrakil: @shibbadibba he said no roadshow. so it’ll just be played in LA
[2:19:30] desemaia: @Cloud9 IMT
[2:19:35] the1andonlycorbin: @Cloud9 IMT EZ
[2:19:36] BalloonHorses: @Cloud9 Golden guardians
[2:19:38] Maokwa: @leagueofemily little happy accident with emily rand
[2:19:40] ThaGovna: Need a Morgana oil painting please @leagueofemily
[2:19:40] PantherShakaZulu: The problem with LCS is Riot didn't create any of the narratives. So as players retired, they had no creative way to reenergize the league.
[2:19:41] leagueofemily: @ThaGovna ???
[2:19:55] JAMnTST: @leagueofemily have you tried oil paints on miniatures?
[2:19:55] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:20:05] iEnigmaaa: @Cloud9 Bo would 1v9, KC would be up 5k gold and 3 drakes, IMT would win ultimately. KEKW
[2:20:12] ThaGovna: I'm not even joking
[2:20:18] android51__: @Cloud9 majinPause Im now hyped.
[2:20:19] leagueofemily: actually as an aside, one of our producers made a wall with all of the draw my life pages in the office i was floored it was very cool
[2:20:20] ImmortalScrub: @cubbyxx no way what a small world. I was just living in STC the last few years
[2:20:21] iEnigmaaa: also FeelsBadMan for Yamato
[2:20:23] desemaia: what was his name?
[2:20:26] robsiipopsii: Yeah looking at Kcorp is depressing they are so bad
[2:20:31] kerokerogrips: @leagueofemily  do you like "The Emily Random " as your fandom name ?
[2:20:43] Deuxblem: hope they didnt lay off the music team
[2:20:43] iEnigmaaa: @leagueofemily this is wonderful. this needs to be shown on the broadcast at some point.
[2:20:43] cliffDOTsun: @Cloud9 can your team just chill for spring split and let TL take it so i can keep cheering for them?
[2:20:44] ThexBlackwater: makes no sense firing tenured people thats all it comes down too
[2:20:51] HippoSquirrel: Woo Chicago!
[2:21:02] leagueofemily: @kerokerogrips I think Randoms is actually a super funny name because one of my close friends started it as a meme
[2:21:05] Cloud9: @cliffDOTsun not happening
[2:21:08] iEnigmaaa: "calling from the home of deep dish pizzas"
[2:21:11] leagueofemily: and then it became an actual thing
[2:21:11] desemaia: Travis go a whole show without saying the evil world: Impossible
[2:21:25] j_tripper: here we go
[2:21:26] spudrat_: Classic take, classic
[2:21:26] Nakrim: based
[2:21:28] Azikielboi: just glazing mark
[2:21:29] CouchyHOTS: paid caller
[2:21:29] ixbx: spend more money? what year is this?
[2:21:31] Deuxblem: classic take we can almost all agree on
[2:21:31] Thiccnuggie: PepePls
[2:21:32] OG_Plumwick: thats a classic take
[2:21:34] sheikhshihab: Travis's son
[2:21:35] Azikielboi: i mean travis*
[2:21:37] numiiigoesrawrz: take: LCS teams need to stop spending money on boomerang imports and more on coaches and training
[2:21:39] Cubbyxx: Ending with a plant
[2:21:46] Azikielboi: travis plant
[2:21:49] cliffDOTsun: fine then im not telling lisa to name her baby @Cloud9
[2:22:04] pasak1987: Jenson proud of outclassing challengers players o-o
[2:22:10] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips Ill take that as a yes :D
[2:22:15] cliffDOTsun: was gonna get you the free advertisement but whatver cliffd1Rage cliffd1Rage LUL
[2:22:15] Azikielboi: FAKER GIGAHCAD
[2:22:21] coin1: so true
[2:22:22] Azikielboi: faker can control 5 brains at once
[2:22:30] the1andonlycorbin: the Berserker interview with Meteos was great
[2:22:33] iEnigmaaa: committing to a bad play as an entire team is better than half committing to a good play
[2:22:34] GreenCervidae: faker and his 4 mind-controlled puppets win worlds multiple times EZPZ
[2:22:37] JAMnTST: I loved Jensen's take. I get tired of teams just automatically jumping to get imports
[2:22:38] leagueofemily: @kerokerogrips it is i love it
[2:22:40] Deuxblem: Synergy is  instinctual instant communication
[2:23:12] numiiigoesrawrz: what if bringing a korean import AND supporting them with coaches and infrastructure?
[2:23:16] ixbx: how different is import vs import who speaks english
[2:23:19] karlheinzstockfootage: adults are kinda ok living away from their family tho
[2:23:21] numiiigoesrawrz: berserker and river have seemed okay in their accumulation
[2:23:23] pasak1987: @numiiigoesrawrz TL>
[2:23:25] ThaGovna: @numiiigoesrawrz TL leaves the chat
[2:23:31] desemaia: @numiiigoesrawrz no money
[2:23:32] xxSirlancealotx: i think umpti is going to be a real good import as well
[2:23:41] Palafox: @numiiigoesrawrz communication barrier too hard i think - u see some imports working out but THEY DONT HAVE BREAKS if they want to work
[2:23:49] ILoveNsync_: @dalimccubist you are not an adult at 17-21.
[2:23:50] SevTST: Isn't Jensen himself and import? Lol
[2:23:56] robsiipopsii: Ye
[2:24:04] boba_bunbun: t1a rekkles
[2:24:12] karlheinzstockfootage: that's the implication.  :)
[2:24:14] iEnigmaaa: ^^
[2:24:18] cliffDOTsun: worked in korea for a year...that working culture is too toxic
[2:24:21] numiiigoesrawrz: would say berserker and river have seemed OKAY though i don't know behind the scenes
[2:24:26] PantherShakaZulu: @numiiigoesrawrz It all depends on the person. Leaving your entire life and moving to a new place where you can't speak with people is rough. Not seeing friends and family for months isn't for everybody.
[2:24:28] iEnigmaaa: @SevTST yes but theres a difference re: language barrier if Jensen is fluent in English
[2:24:35] Mortryx: @SevTST he was talking about korean imports in NA
[2:24:37] heftychen: didn't santorin go back to EU cause he was like i gotta move on with my life
[2:25:25] Crazylegs722: !discord
[2:25:26] Nightbot: discord.gg/travis
[2:25:29] cliffDOTsun: do you guys think rekkles will integrate or burn out in lck?
[2:25:31] ThaGovna: Communication is truly king
[2:25:32] Thiccnuggie: true tbh
[2:25:32] karlheinzstockfootage: what job on earth does one's peak years end before you can rent a car?
[2:25:35] SevTST: I get that, but when we complain about imports it ain't just the Korean one's.
[2:26:03] SevTST: Perkz still left. Hans Sama still left. Tocouille still left.
[2:26:17] pasak1987: @cliffDOTsun idk if he would burn out, but not sure if he would be able to advance to LCK
[2:26:20] PVSunata: Fly and TL even still importing to NACL
[2:26:42] SevTST: It's more about the person than the region is all. And a lot of it has to do with their contract situations at times as well.
[2:26:56] karlheinzstockfootage: @SevTST tocouille got his make-a-wish dream with john cena granted
[2:26:58] BalloonHorses: So basically team liquid breaking point with matt?
[2:27:03] BalloonHorses: sad
[2:27:08] nfcpm: language is a big issue. but for the player so is not having family or culture etc. around when they move countries.
[2:27:10] cliffDOTsun: @pasak1987 learning korean on top of those like 12hr+ work days...idk man...i feel like the burn out is almost inevitable?
[2:27:12] spudrat_: kinda of insane how "making worlds" is kind of desaturated/hard to appreciate.  like that is such a huge achievement
[2:27:23] GreenCervidae: yeah rookies were really exciting
[2:27:24] numiiigoesrawrz: massu 💚
[2:27:34] karlheinzstockfootage: Ebilly elegy
[2:27:36] VerbalHorse: We need another Berserker, someone get LS on the phone
[2:27:46] pasak1987: @cliffDOTsun if he was going to get burnt out by that, he wouldn't have chose to go there i think.  If anything, he would use what he learned from T1C and go back to LEC.
[2:27:49] VerbalHorse: No more terrible imports
[2:28:05] IAmMurdr: he just really hates boomerangs

[2:28:35] cliffDOTsun: i hope so @pasak1987 cause honestly its a lot more than most people can imagine...its one thing to do a camp in korea...but living there full time is not...like as comfortable as EU or NA in most parts
[2:28:36] GreenCervidae: it's okay travis you can say TL
[2:28:53] JohrDinh: Its hard to believe in a region that doesnt believe in itself
[2:28:55] Azikielboi: YEP
[2:28:57] Azikielboi: thats you YEP
[2:29:00] robsiipopsii: I mean look at mad in EU they almost have all rookies and it works out well
[2:29:02] desemaia: can the bad teams like IMT and DIG at least get the import rule removed from them. Lets just see what they can pull off
[2:29:04] Azikielboi: crazy old man travis boomed gafford YEP
[2:29:12] pasak1987: @cliffDOTsun ehhhh, aside from language issue, it's prettty comfortable.
[2:29:12] Azikielboi: boomer*
[2:29:56] Aura16: LUL LUL LUL
[2:30:05] spudrat_: what is the catalyst for ignar being able to go to eu?  just that he realized he wanted to and had to wait for season end?
[2:30:06] SevTST: I guess people don't really count roster turnover in EU if they just go into an EU Regional League.
[2:30:08] pasak1987: glad TL is sticking with Yeon and APA this year

[2:30:46] Jeankof: Imt going for the moon xdd
[2:30:53] leagueofemily: Palafox's Lukewarm Takes
[2:31:00] VerbalHorse: If you want a terrible tema to cheer for every split it's IMT!
[2:31:01] nizzy2k11: who the fuck thinks their brand is winning besides C9 and
[2:31:04] pasak1987: TL has a solid SC legacy fan base >:D
[2:31:04] JohrDinh: I supported TL when they were 10th, cuz their brand was more than winning
[2:31:04] nizzy2k11: TL
[2:31:07] Azikielboi: thats cope
[2:31:17] nizzy2k11: who are these GMs/owners that need to get sober
[2:31:18] Andyyybarton: roster turnover isn't good
[2:31:22] cliffDOTsun: <TL legacy fan
[2:31:25] Azikielboi: there are bad players even in the eastern leagues, its just "bad" means "less good"
[2:31:30] Thiccnuggie: peepoSad
[2:31:34] pasak1987: <- Korean, so TL SC legacy fan
[2:31:34] Contractz: palafox new team owner
[2:31:38] saltedapplesiv: players should democratize the workplace
[2:31:41] karlheinzstockfootage: i became a tl fan just cause i was a legacy imt fan
[2:31:41] vlogfinity: As a C9 fan.... 👀
[2:31:43] attackonhumby: TL is 3/5 from last year's roster BTW
[2:31:44] JohrDinh: Content helps too, we dont do that anymore tho
[2:31:51] onetrueshawn: its a necessary mentality in a failing industry
[2:31:52] nfcpm: like Jensen
[2:31:52] VerbalHorse: Trying random imports is just so crazy in 2024 wiht all the NA talent benched currently
[2:31:53] ImmortalScrub: @verbalhorse there was a year where IMT shit on everyone back in the day
[2:31:59] TheDixieCup: @Contractz go niners baby they pulled it out
[2:32:00] iEnigmaaa: FNC Oscarinin's first weekend was abysmal
[2:32:01] Thiccnuggie: "YOU'RE NOT GONNA BEAT US SO GIVE UP."
[2:32:08] cliffDOTsun: also...these other teams...need to have animal mascots... @Cloud9 looking at you...your logo is a cloud...do you know how hard it is to cheer for a cloud?
[2:32:09] teetii_: @travisgafford Like everyone flaming Quid for being put in the worst situation possible ?
[2:32:14] iEnigmaaa: couple months later, people were saying he was their best player
[2:32:14] Muzvein: TL fans are so bad about expectations (coming from a TL fan)
[2:32:15] leagueofemily: i keep repeating this like a broken record but the best thing about this clg/nrg core is that players were given the grace to make mistakes
[2:32:23] ConfidentialTTV: winning brings money into ur brand name buying jerseys. so this is america and capitalism u need to win rip
[2:32:36] iEnigmaaa: @leagueofemily this. extremely common Emily Rand W.
[2:32:44] NihilistGamer1: People had given up on Licorice and then after his run on GGS everyone says it a shame he didn't get on a team
[2:32:52] JohrDinh: @Muzvein If you've been around since Curse days its nothing but upside
[2:32:55] ConfidentialTTV: did anyone buy kansas city chiefs jerseys before like 4 years ago? no
[2:32:55] leagueofemily: lmao
[2:32:57] Nenttv: Nenttv subscribed with Prime. 
[2:32:58] vlogfinity: TLs brand is 4th
[2:33:11] nizzy2k11: @vlogfinity facts
[2:33:12] iEnigmaaa: @NihilistGamer1 if he was on a team this year, i have no doubt he would either be the best top in the league atm or at bare minimum in the convo
[2:33:13] VaronVariante: Back in the day, Jin Air Greenwings was known for being a starting point for new players too
[2:33:15] cliffDOTsun: 4 in ranking 1st in our hearts
[2:33:17] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:33:24] karlheinzstockfootage: @leagueofemily not wrong.  esp. when na players aren't given the quick hook
[2:33:30] Obsirver: IMT doesn't act like relegation exists
[2:33:31] TheDixieCup: content is king over winning, winning is still great tho
[2:33:32] GreenCervidae: EG & GG >>>>>>> DIG & IMT Sadge
[2:33:38] Sifuginsaing: EG found success by abusing their players
[2:33:40] JohrDinh: bring back Rebirth
[2:33:42] TheDixieCup: if teams make good content, they will have good followers
[2:33:48] robsiipopsii: @leagueofemily tbh without this clg/nrg roster i think I would have stopped watching the lcs. Like I was a clg fan since day 1 but the lcs slowly got tiresome like 2 3 years ago
[2:33:54] NihilistGamer1: @iEnigmaaa Oh I completely agree. Everyone was calling him washed the year before though
[2:34:05] Deuxblem: who?
[2:34:08] Azqato: wow peter dun is with perkz and jankos now
[2:34:13] ENV187: Peter Dun is the goat
[2:34:14] OG_Plumwick: he wasnt the coach
[2:34:24] karlheinzstockfootage: bring back phoenix1
[2:34:28] iEnigmaaa: Inero not having a spot at the table is a tragedy. its not a coincidence that GG kept finding success.

[2:35:07] ConfidentialTTV: tencent literally makes billions and owns riot? is it riot or is it tencent?
[2:35:09] karlheinzstockfootage: mark is the fall guy.  regi even biled to not take the blame
[2:35:10] Aura16: @palafox I love you
[2:35:11] nfcpm: Markz seemed most suprised he wasn't one of the 530
[2:35:22] eliaswrites: shoutout to @Palafox he was in the last piece of content I did and idk if it's gonna come out but he was fucking awesome

[2:36:23] j_tripper: it’s doomed
[2:36:32] TheDixieCup: sniper riven based lets talk about it @Cubbyxx
[2:36:34] catgoesmyao: HOTLINE LIFE
[2:36:35] leagueofemily: Each of you should name your favorite LCS game
[2:36:36] RaqoTaco: talk about NACL it is more interesting anyway
[2:36:37] imainleesin: literally no talk about week1 games KEKW
[2:36:38] HaveFunDave: It took years for Mark Z to grow on me, but the last 2 years he did on your show. I still feel Mark Z is a product of nepotism, but i like the chaNGES  so far @travisgafford
[2:36:38] leagueofemily: I know mine :3

[2:36:51] saltedapplesiv: sorry for not calling about how bad imt continues to be
[2:36:51] ixbx: quick take: which rookie shined the most in week 1
[2:36:52] kerokerogrips: week 1 games take , c9 is a step above other teams
[2:36:53] nizzy2k11: until someone beats C9 there aint nothing to say about the LCS
[2:36:55] cliffDOTsun: sniper was the best actor in the trailetr
[2:37:00] cliffDOTsun: thats all i know about week 1
[2:37:00] nfcpm: Cubby wouldn't take those calls, he hates LCS.
[2:37:03] BalloonHorses: week 1 - cloud 9 good, flyquest looked good. the rest of the games....meh
[2:37:04] bondance: i usually just listen to the podcast, this was such a depressing episode to tune in live for :,(
[2:37:07] iEnigmaaa: not LCS but KC vs VIT in LEC was.... entertaining.
[2:37:15] Palafox: @BalloonAnimalsandHorses flyquest looked good?
[2:37:19] Palafox: O.O
[2:37:22] ConfidentialTTV: what else is on ur link tree ;)
[2:37:23] JAMnTST: To be fair it is only week 1. Week 3 will have more to speak on
