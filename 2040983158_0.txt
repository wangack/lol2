[0:06:56] WashedxUp222: @bangermanger10 ***
[0:06:59] WashedxUp222: looks like he did
[0:08:59] archie7497: Monte you have to watch rogue vs mad for the trash game. You will die laughing
[0:09:14] WashedxUp222: first draft by blg was good
[0:09:18] quakespectra: its crazy to go from watching lec to watching lpl
[0:09:18] WashedxUp222: can't wait to hear ur thoughts
[0:09:30] smparrish_95: let‚Äôs go
[0:09:31] virtuoso_blades: @montecristo  this BLG vs TES is an excellent banger
[0:09:58] Naxser: @MonteCristo  Bo should go to the lck or retired?
[0:10:02] quakespectra: pressing windows key usually solves it
[0:10:07] bangermanger10: @archie7497 any rogue game makes u wanna laugh to hide the pain
[0:10:08] ASWstreams: I really enjoyed the nerd legion about rebel moon
[0:10:27] lazink: youtube has been doing crazy things lately, like making your cpu do more work if you have an ad-blocker on, even if you have premium
[0:10:57] ASWstreams: yeah that's why i did not watch it but I got to get the trash through osmosis
[0:11:01] truthlol: glad you guys managed to sit through rebel moon i dislike znyders style a lot lol
[0:11:12] archie7497: @quakespectra even edg vs rng which had ale running it down was better than all but 3-4 lec games
[0:11:42] quakespectra: @archie7497 yeah its such a difference.
[0:12:00] AndrasMan01: probably 2 of the top 3 teams in the lpl this season

[0:12:10] Birbmang_: i hope they let creme play his champs at some point tho
[0:12:34] lazink: LPL is a single round robin right?
[0:13:12] WashedxUp222: such a good pick
[0:13:23] AndrasMan01: @lazink yes, though every team plays 16 bo3
[0:13:35] archie7497: Xun was so good on brand
[0:13:49] virtuoso_blades: who played Brand in lck? @montecristo
[0:14:09] archie7497: It will be ad lb so not too much poke
[0:14:18] fistigons25: Knight the AD LeBlanc abuser
[0:14:38] Naxser: @MonteCristo Are you going to watch LEC today?
[0:15:02] archie7497: Ad lb isn't even that good after the 14.1b patch
[0:15:04] smparrish_95: this is kinda random @montecristo but do you have any idea why a lot of Asian players have names based off really simple/random things (ie elk, creme, on, etc.)?
[0:15:36] Birbmang_: it didn't look nerfed at all this series when knight plays it
[0:16:00] fistigons25: lmfao the LeBlanc didn‚Äôt look nerfed at all in this series.
[0:16:06] archie7497: Creme is because he was forced to change his name from crime which was his original id
[0:18:27] MissingMatter: Reminder we're on tall minimap again.

[0:19:28] Naxser: @MonteCristo Why do you believe Karmine Corp is having problems? For the solo laners? Does the team need more time?  I really want Bo and Yamato to do well in LEC
[0:20:11] WashedxUp222: the rumble clip was hilarious
[0:20:21] xoceozcar: is this elite league in your opinion? or do you still thinks there are levels beyond this?
[0:20:22] lvlutedheretic: taking notes, was that two bootys before buttcheeks or just one
[0:20:33] JaYaJ: Targamas is paid by the int 100%

[0:25:12] mv_peter: I've had no issue with them being in the corner, but they should really switch places
[0:25:12] Birbmang_: you expect anything in league of legends to make sense ever?
[0:25:31] LilGimli: usually the LPL And LCK overlays are pretty good to be fair
[0:25:41] fatalqwerty: only BLG vs TES today Monte?
[0:25:56] MissingMatter: Between four leagues we're bound to be able to cobble together an acceptable overlay.
[0:26:00] LilGimli: seems like a weird design choice, hiding them out of view of the necessary info
[0:26:01] archie7497: Or lpl just sees the rift from red side lol
[0:26:08] MissingMatter: This one has proper 0's at least.
[0:26:09] mozomb: damn, china living in the future bro, they have the technology to show grubs kills

[0:26:19] LilGimli: @MissingMatter have you seen the LCS font? its horrendous

[0:32:01] fatalqwerty: Udyr should've built the MR sunfire, at least he wouldve made it to mid-game
[0:32:21] Goatsguffle: so can you go more into detail of how the pro teams are exploiting or using the map layout?
[0:32:31] professor_wormbog_: ON just has no respect for getting hooked

[0:34:27] fortant69: i got more learning about the new season to do
[0:34:30] Naxser: @MonteCristo In your opinion who is ProPlayer closest to season 3 Faker in level of dominance as sololaner?
[0:34:32] Nytrodark: @Nymaera_ its still good, they need to delete statik shiv to prevent this shit ad leb
[0:34:33] LilGimli: did he also not make the brand invade possible by stopping azirs back and taking the tower shot
[0:34:45] fatalqwerty: can we skip to the end and review one more game? Feels like BLG will roll over TES at this point
[0:35:00] Nytrodark: no one is building statik shiv except for lebanc
[0:35:09] LilGimli: feels like azir xin would win 2v2 if he wasnt 100hp
[0:35:10] archie7497: @nymaera_ doesn't help that creme isn't an azir player historically
[0:36:17] Nymaera_: TES try to throw a Hail Mary a few times but BLG never really gave them options
[0:36:32] Nymaera_: if you get a good enough hook you can maybe get a shutdown
[0:36:35] xkravianx: I love brand so much.
[0:36:40] Nymaera_: but that‚Äôs as good as it gets
[0:36:42] MissingMatter: I think every Kalista ult I've seen is "let's just avoid a kill here"
[0:37:15] Nymaera_: bin MVP of that fight, insane pee
[0:37:18] Nymaera_: *peel oops
[0:37:33] hibbjibb: typo of the week right there
[0:37:35] Nytrodark: i think creme is overrated, he's just getting carried by shanji during his time in omg
[0:37:52] Nymaera_: ‚Äúlocal LPL top laner pisses all over opponents‚Äù
[0:38:18] LilGimli: creme feels alot like zeka, dominant on melees, servicable on control mages
[0:38:35] lazink: at least it's not a western team with this lead, you'd be here for another 20 minutes while they try to close it
[0:38:41] Nymaera_: @lilgimli not a bad comparison yeah
[0:38:55] Nymaera_: @lazink don‚Äôt watch RNG EDG lol
[0:38:58] Nytrodark: yeah creme sylas is good
[0:38:58] frieza558: was this really a banger tho?

[0:39:40] Evan_Ralston: games can be a banger without being close
[0:39:41] Birbmang_: local chatter has no eye test
[0:39:49] Nymaera_: and also game 2 was fun from them, lots of bot lane prio stuff affecting this series

[0:42:26] Nymaera_: @lilgimli oh they weren‚Äôt rumours there was no LPL broadcast for a solid few months

[0:43:14] XLOftw: damn i missed the champion select, brand banned?
[0:43:23] Nytrodark: I have my eyes on NIP this spring split the roster looks good
[0:43:32] Nymaera_: yeah NIP‚Äôs strong
[0:43:41] WashedxUp222: they didn't go with a poke comp
[0:43:56] Nymaera_: BLG/JDG/TES/LNG/NIP are all legit, maybe WBG we‚Äôll see
[0:44:06] Birbmang_: comet on aatrox vs udyr kinda weird tho

[1:13:03] AzureCatalyst: Atalanta is a goat name for a girl
[1:13:06] feromortum: You could do Tiffany from the greek Theophania
[1:13:14] Jeffp2662: seems like kayle ult would be so valuable in LPL
[1:13:20] fatalqwerty: Persephone is such a gigastacy name tho no cap

[1:14:43] carnivalnights: Monte, do you have any info on whether that position in Riot still exists where a person just sits in front of a podium and just connects Rioters together to play League?  Imagine, 40 hours, full benefits doing basically nothing.
[1:14:43] Clyde1500: @airbrid is the show out yet?

[1:16:00] Adanion: I actually didnt appreciate how good it was until the edit somehow LUL
[1:16:06] Adanion: how nice it looked especially
[1:16:47] soraaikin: chinese teams are so good at sieging man
[1:16:58] Adanion: I loved how they didnt blow their load on the story, snice paced burn
[1:17:00] MissingMatter: Oh, yeah, I forgot they were redoing Shogun. @lazink We occasionally pull out the card game based on the old miniseries, still
[1:17:04] Imaslapyou: Is that the parallel story-telling/puppet show episode?
[1:17:05] wiMc13: which show's episode 5?
[1:17:11] wiMc13: oh
[1:17:26] mv_peter: Haunting of Hill house is so good
[1:17:36] AzureCatalyst: I think I would kill for a Nerd Legion episode by episode breakdown of The Wire
[1:17:42] mv_peter: Haunting of Bly Manor, not so much
[1:17:45] ProdigalChicken: OMEGALUL
[1:17:47] feromortum: BrainSlug
[1:17:47] trinhanvu: HUH
[1:17:48] Nymaera_: ah yes omicron persei 8 politics
[1:17:58] serkaine: Who got gapped this game.  I came in when creme got caught, then smurfed the rest of the fight.  Also was game 1 good and worthy of finding the vod?
[1:17:58] Goatsguffle: he just smelled you saying that be careful
[1:18:09] MissingMatter: @Nymaera_ We call it Omicron Percy.
[1:18:20] MissingMatter: It's on-theme today.
[1:18:28] Nymaera_: HAHA
[1:18:40] AzureCatalyst: game 1 was a good watch. I‚Äôd definitely walk it
[1:18:44] Nymaera_: @serkaine game 1 was a great snowball
[1:18:58] AzureCatalyst: the knight ad Leblanc masterclass was  fantastic showcase of it even though it was merged
[1:19:18] AzureCatalyst: nerfed*
[1:19:18] Clyde1500: why would you let leblanc through again?
[1:19:56] AzureCatalyst: I thought they were only going to AD Leblanc with AP junglers but I think they‚Äôre gonna run AP lb with Wukong now
[1:20:03] trinhanvu: TES thinking that just because LB is nefted she's bad
[1:20:27] Nymaera_: pretty sure it‚Äôs AD leblanc again to have mixed damage split pushers
[1:20:28] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:21:32] AzureCatalyst: elk has to go on hit Varus to kill the soon and I expect kennen and lb to just split push after the first 2 drakes go down
[1:23:21] AzureCatalyst: seeing the raka and kalista just reminds me of how badly Rogue managed their roster and the Comp and Trymbi Raka Kalista lanes ugh
[1:24:21] rtm349: hi Monte, congrats on #2!
[1:25:06] zionsick: do you get grumpy when tired?
[1:25:13] Adanion: 2 harder than 1 I certainly found out LUL
[1:25:28] serkaine: Lck feels much weaker than lpl. With t1 vs geng already complete it feels as though we were denied a high quality series. In the LPL we don't need to worry about tes vs big being at the beginning due to an increase of depth of talent on these top lpl teams. I know we are bound to get more great series.

[1:27:11] najafan: @imainleesin Well, yes, that's Hotline League for you.
[1:27:27] lazink: oy
[1:27:28] imainleesin: @fatalqwerty literally nothing about the LCS games even
[1:27:30] fljqpy: shoemaker will come back üôè
[1:27:42] carnivalnights: Travis reminds me of the "journalists" that cover the UFC. Spineless and asks nothing but softball questions like what their favorite color is.
[1:27:44] efisch: Monte what was your favorite version of the KT Roster of all time?
[1:27:49] archie7497: @montecristo btw speaking of ad kennen did you watch theshy's ad kennen game in regional finals 2020?
[1:27:52] lazink: it's a classic Sports Radio trick, you take callers so you don't have to do any actual work
[1:28:00] najafan: The premise is literally that randos call in and give their takes about LCS, as if that's interesting.
[1:28:09] AzureCatalyst: Travis gafford is if soy milk were a person
[1:28:11] mv_peter: that was sick
[1:28:15] Adanion: @carnivalnights dont worry, they are in all sports
[1:28:20] trinhanvu: ON THAT WAS CRAZY
[1:28:21] professor_wormbog_: That was a great handshake
[1:28:24] najafan: I remember that when the Doublelift/Leena/Dardoch stuff happened they REFUSED to let Richard Lewis come on.
[1:28:35] zionsick: damn that was clean
[1:28:36] fatalqwerty: You dont like the KTA with Kakao
[1:28:38] AzureCatalyst: is that the KT B with Insec as a Top Zac Onetrick?
[1:28:40] firefly: was that KTB team the one with insec?
[1:28:51] najafan: They actively ignored him in chat until Crumbz mentioned him in the call.
[1:28:56] kerokerogrips: @MonteCristo  were esports a zero interest phenomenon ?
[1:28:59] imainleesin: all the clowns keep their jobs Sadge
[1:29:09] Adanion: the joke is they fired all the people that DIDNT fart on women
[1:29:12] zen__cloud: are you talking about riot or the us government?
[1:29:15] carnivalnights: That one position where someone literally just "connects"  Rioters together to play League should've been laid off years ago.
[1:29:17] NutRat: the c suite perverts probably safe too yeah?
[1:29:21] kerokerogrips: zero interest rate in the us
[1:29:25] Clyde1500: meteos said one of the people that runs the dive was fired but idr who it was.
[1:29:33] someknown: I missed your analysis of picks and bans, whats your take on the scion in this live patch
[1:29:43] najafan: Zero interest ~= no growth.
[1:29:43] fljqpy: if it was not interesting they wouldnt invest
[1:29:52] Usingu: Do you think riot is gonna see growth in their "core" games from the business side of things?
[1:29:58] zionsick: Usually who get laid off are the plebs. The ones shitting the bed (upper management) are just fine.
[1:30:18] najafan: It required low interest rates for a ton of investment as a result.
[1:30:26] carnivalnights: My nephew said League is a boomer game.
[1:30:27] fatalqwerty: KTA with ssumday, KaKAO, RooKie, Arrow, Hachani? FeelsBadMan I felt that that was THE team

[1:30:41] quakespectra: the problem is that the standard was to get all in esport for free. now its hard to backtrack and monetize
[1:30:43] AzureCatalyst: eSports as a 100x investment always seemed like an insane pipe dream if we're being honest
[1:30:47] topalphadog1: @MonteCristo do you think esport viewer ship got effected, by international performances
[1:30:48] WashedxUp222: that seemed like a bad raka ult
[1:30:58] efisch: Im all here for a ppv model on tournaments in esports
[1:31:09] AzureCatalyst: @topalphadog1 Well Chinese viewership went up
[1:31:14] imainleesin: Has the west been playing wukong at all? (i know NA hasn't)
[1:31:15] lazink: isn't the major problem with esports, is that they can't seem to sell media rights?
[1:31:21] AndrasMan01: We just need to get rid of the moneyless crying kids and esports will be fine
[1:31:25] trinhanvu: Do you think Dom could have delivered us an LPL english broadcast everyday ? Feels like Riot just took it from him and half-ass the product
[1:31:25] Komarimasita: ive been watching lck since 2013, i just catch lcs when its on
[1:31:31] zionsick: LCS is shit, I just watch LCK/LPL replays nowadays
[1:31:41] mv_peter: more like blue balls you
[1:31:46] fljqpy: just sub on twitch to watch 4Head
[1:31:50] fljqpy: how easy was that

[1:32:50] anomalous_autumn: frfr
[1:32:51] Nymaera_: but yeah bit shakey
[1:32:54] AzureCatalyst: His flash and heal weren't gonna save him ugh
[1:33:06] AzureCatalyst: Shoulda saved him once he gets engaged on tbh
[1:33:26] fljqpy: onhit varus, finally some dps
[1:33:39] PapaSmithy: this series was not high quality
[1:33:51] AzureCatalyst: @PapaSmithy What are you talking about

[1:34:17] wale_lol: fljqpy: LCS is better
[1:34:26] Nymaera_: well, BLG played well at least
[1:34:30] firefly: I don't know why Wukong isn't more popular, feels like it's nearly guaranteed every time
[1:34:33] AzureCatalyst: Game 1 was clean a F but game 2 and 3 thus far have been ehhh
[1:34:40] kerokerogrips: consider this if you dont like saudi arabia wouldnt you want to waste money into the money sucking vacuum that is esports ?
[1:34:41] imainleesin: @firefly same
[1:35:02] n_e_i_l: pretty sure he was just walking to that play from base, so surely he was watching. wasnt even just a panic wish
[1:35:04] fljqpy: blg winning worlds 2024 üôè

[1:36:03] najafan: That item is #1 on LS's shortlist rn.
[1:36:35] dbxnaato: the MR sunfire cape? yeah it's pretty awful
[1:36:38] najafan: He HATES Hollow Radiance
[1:36:50] n_e_i_l: compared to rookern especially
[1:36:52] najafan: Worse than Morello he says
[1:37:08] archie7497: He says h
[1:37:25] fatalqwerty: @najafan why does he hate hollow radiance?
[1:37:27] archie7497: *just to sit on bami and build into a different item
[1:37:29] dbxnaato: the argument is, why bother completing the item when you can get bami and a negatron towards something else?
[1:37:38] Naxser: @MonteCristo The problem was that it didn't grow naturally and wasn't monetized correctly. You know more about the subject, but what do you think about the fighting scene looks like that grows more organically and independently than other esports
[1:37:42] najafan: Yeah, just buy Bami and build something else like Rookern
[1:37:46] najafan: Is his idea.
[1:38:34] zen__cloud: at least the new tekken and SF6 tourneys actually have prize pools worth somethign now
[1:38:42] WashedxUp222: yeah ibdw in melee didn't have an org while he was a top 2 player
[1:38:54] carnivalnights: Monte, have you ever tried to venture casting and reviewing fighting game matches?
[1:38:56] fljqpy: what a 3some
[1:38:58] Gikeuri13: Smash was starting to do ok then Nintendo fucks things up
[1:39:38] fljqpy: ahh yes the bullshit that is azir ult
[1:40:09] mv_peter: kalista Q here
[1:40:33] n_e_i_l: too busy grubbin the tower
[1:40:56] carnivalnights: Monte, whatever happened to Rivington? We know what happened to Dash, but Riv just disappeared.
[1:40:56] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:41:03] fatalqwerty: Top esports looking mid Kappa
[1:41:12] najafan: @carnivalnights He wanted to retire iirc?
[1:41:27] Youistheniqq: tes shotcaller still jackelove or something?
[1:41:28] Clyde1500: It's very funny that nobody in this community follows valo
[1:41:29] najafan: Like, he literally wanted to move on to something else.
[1:41:35] professor_wormbog_: Riv gets to do what he really wants now, I feel
[1:41:55] Sodo_Mojo: LUL Û†ÄÄ
[1:41:56] fljqpy: we have cs
[1:41:59] svejx: true
[1:42:05] Nymaera_: watching val as a casual sucks
[1:42:10] WashedxUp222: so true
[1:42:13] Nymaera_: have to have moba knowledge for a shooter
[1:42:13] fatalqwerty: How could Riot fumble the ball so bad with Valorant?
[1:42:16] fljqpy: its not even weeb enough
[1:42:23] Nymaera_: but as a game it‚Äôs fun to play
[1:42:23] zen__cloud: do you think valo is worse or better than overwatch as a spectator sport?
[1:42:27] gooogleplus: weeb?
[1:42:38] svejx: remake!
[1:42:39] kerokerogrips: you have to play valorant a lot to understand all of the champions and what they do when watching valorant , while i can tune into to cs and know when a sick play just occured
[1:42:45] kAtz124: why?
[1:42:45] zionsick: howcome?
[1:42:47] Komarimasita: CALL HIM A DINGUS
[1:43:02] ohsomagical_: review c9 vs 100 ?
[1:43:18] d_kowalski: Do you still do PowerSpike or is Dgon out?
[1:43:22] fljqpy: nothing is worse than OW
[1:43:27] najafan: Stop being trash panda, smh.
[1:43:38] ohsomagical_: Creme inting ?
[1:43:50] Neumonyx: @MonteCristo What is Power Spike?
[1:43:58] zionsick: disable azir! lol
[1:44:03] beauds69: soraka pick so good into lb
[1:44:11] fljqpy: power spike is when the botlane gets lv2 before their opponents
[1:44:14] carnivalnights: It's unfortunate JackeyLove and TheShy couldn't stay teamed up together. I think they would've ruled League like Bengi and Faker.
[1:44:36] mv_peter: @carnivalnights bait
[1:44:49] fruge2: imagine watching this and saying "lcs can compete w/ this"
[1:44:52] Neumonyx: oh ok, ty
[1:45:11] carnivalnights: @mv_peter Jackey was good when he and TheShy were together.
[1:45:15] xChip102: is there a champion you wish could be played more in pro play?
[1:45:18] d_kowalski: tell the world why KT will win at least one title
[1:45:21] Pktatics: Good to hear SeemsGood
[1:45:25] TwiceTSTS: 369 and Jacky are in elo hell
[1:45:26] najafan: @xChip102 Yorick :)
[1:45:51] fljqpy: ahh yes the mosquito that is AD LB
[1:46:35] dbxnaato: volibear's got the cool dance

[1:46:41] fatalqwerty: Yeah Voli towerdive is very underrated, I wonder why chinese teams dont use it more often
[1:46:42] froglok_: Eve or Shaco would be a dream
[1:46:45] RomanticCreampie: someone pls put azir in pro jail
[1:46:45] najafan: LS also doesn't like AD LB in pro, which was interesting to me.
[1:46:49] direpants2: what a flash
[1:46:51] xChip102: volibear has my favorite dance in the whole game
[1:47:07] serkaine: Why you think rookie is keeping himself on mid-low tier teams?
[1:47:10] zenakleve: Do you have any info regarding why RIOT cutting down on their staff headcounts?
[1:47:18] Manjiji: twitch notifications are garbage :( 2 hours late
[1:47:24] direpants2: being dirty inters
[1:47:35] Pktatics: Ah the classic tian int
[1:47:43] najafan: Yorick should be meta, so they fix his bugs
[1:47:44] fljqpy: ppl just have their ideas of what a champion is supposed to be
[1:48:10] Nymaera_: Aight I‚Äôve gotta fly now, enjoy the rest of the games
[1:48:20] fljqpy: "LB must be AP assassin"
[1:48:40] najafan: @fljqpy Nah, he just thinks it's soloq only.
[1:48:56] fljqpy: did he say why
[1:49:11] najafan: It was just an offhand remark in his 5 hour item video.
[1:49:41] fljqpy: just one of those LS takes i guess
[1:50:22] serkaine: Do you think knight is better than rookie?
[1:50:37] fljqpy: kennen with the book of sins
[1:50:39] archie7497: Yesterday during this game it was funny how everyone was saying the lec started early
[1:50:46] Duje275: cloud soul on lb barf

[1:52:03] najafan: I mean, a whole bunch of other mids would be fun to see again.
[1:52:23] Naxser: @MonteCristo Is it nostalgia or the OGN had a much better format than the current LCK. I remember that my watch experience was better with the 3 tournaments
[1:52:25] fljqpy: literally first day of LPL xdd
[1:52:35] professor_wormbog_: Top 2 Brand on BLG?
