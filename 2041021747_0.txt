[1:05:22] denunciator: storm into a zeal item into IE I tink
[1:05:36] ButterMyTooshie: @ElChappo if youre playing him support build suppoirt
[1:05:37] Stitch_suplol: caits highest win rate build is ghost blade first funny enough
[1:05:47] Stitch_suplol: actually stormrazer into ie is just as high
[1:06:02] ElChappo: stormrazor into ie, or you can go full lethality also works well
[1:06:14] Whattehpho: filled again?
[1:06:20] denunciator: I think the reason ie is so high is you have to be snowballing really hard to go ie 2nd

[1:27:48] kufuhu: attack speed is fake without LT
[1:28:03] denunciator: although it's funny to maximize the value of ie 2nd you have to get all the headshots in a clean combo, so it's really just lethality cait with more expensive items
