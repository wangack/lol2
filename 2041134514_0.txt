[1:43:36] TheHardkaare: gold mate
[1:43:43] vad3: league content  Pog
[1:43:43] oswes: taric run
[1:43:53] Tyokath: can't you just kill in a lane for gold
[1:43:57] monkeyinlife: 15
[1:43:57] DirtyDan79: tragic
[1:43:57] vad3: lvl 1 fiesta x0r6ztGiggle
[1:43:59] LogicalCrowe: your not helping this akalis mental lol
[1:44:02] TheSwunk: 15
[1:44:03] juhiizRS: Bit of chimping Tomfoolery
[1:44:06] WeaponSupplier: lol
[1:44:14] Shutori: 3Heading
[1:45:04] Tyokath: and why do others not need the gold
[1:45:12] juhiizRS: Stop chimping DogO
[1:45:25] DirtyDan79: alkDMCA
[1:45:25] TheHardkaare: Clap
[1:45:27] IDazza69: carried
[1:45:29] twainlegs: nice :)
[1:45:30] testplayer457: Wp
[1:45:30] Vallun_: we are so back
[1:45:32] LogicalCrowe: the no E gank wtf
[1:45:44] oswes: classic no e gank
[1:45:54] biggestsugar: He could've done red blue gromp
[1:46:56] TheHardkaare: everyone needs gold, but there's only three lanes and five players @tyokath - so two go bot, one goes jungle
[1:46:57] testplayer457: I can easily go his jungle u gonna fk him if he get no help
[1:47:17] Tyokath: how do others get their gold
[1:47:24] Tyokath: and what does bot mean in this context
[1:47:31] IDazza69: they are raptors? thought they were terrorbirds
[1:47:39] oswes: bot in bottom lane @Tyokath
[1:47:46] TheHardkaare: lane minions - and bot means botlane
[1:47:51] oswes: is*
[1:47:51] WunchleR: @Tyokath  kill things = gold
[1:48:13] shadowsapiens: taric top x0r6ztGiggle

[1:48:24] Kartti_: Kartti_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:48:26] vad3: @shadowsapiens its not that bad actuallly
[1:48:26] Tyokath: doesn't every lane have minions
[1:48:36] TheHardkaare: yeah, but there's only three lanes
[1:49:02] Tyokath: what makes the bottom lane sp special
[1:49:07] Ice_Cloud: a lee sin game would be comical
[1:49:10] Tyokath: that it needs 2
[1:49:20] Mala_Fide: it's just the meta
[1:49:23] shadowsapiens: normal a squishy carry
[1:49:30] vad3: taric can easily 1v1 tryndamere before lvl 6
[1:49:34] shadowsapiens: so they need emotional support
[1:49:36] shadowsapiens: KEKW
[1:49:37] TheHardkaare: squishy hardcarry + a support
[1:49:41] WunchleR: @Tyokath  the carry needs a babysitter to keep him in check
[1:49:57] shadowsapiens: the support gets gold from items when with someone else
[1:49:58] Tyokath: but it could be done in any lane?
[1:50:13] shadowsapiens: that would be a lane swap
[1:50:16] shadowsapiens: Kappa
[1:50:22] TheHardkaare: yeah in theory, would not end well tho
[1:50:37] Tyokath: but in theory everyone could switch to middle lane for 2 people
[1:50:38] IDazza69: senna scary if she can stack enough

[1:51:05] TheHardkaare: yeah, it's just meta to go bot - mid is kinda exposed in comparison
[1:51:07] Ice_Cloud: Chatting ...
[1:51:18] fatman_on_a_bike: i mean you totally pinged i
[1:51:19] PicoloRS: she got caught
[1:51:26] kultsipupu: fuk
[1:51:41] JStiggy: you'd have the two side lanes ganking middle so its less safe for a squishy compared to a side lane (I assume)
[1:51:42] Tyokath: so all the random stuff just gives gold
[1:51:43] Aerinour: morning SN, you should drag your chat box off your screen. that's how i got diamond a few seasons

[1:54:24] Vallun_: leoJ
[1:54:25] TheHardkaare: this is true
[1:54:27] Tyokath: according to chat
[1:54:36] IDazza69: unlocked camera should be removed from the game
[1:54:40] IDazza69: locked cam only

[1:56:50] LeninsShlong: Would league be accessible to new players at this point? Or is it like osrs PKing, everyone that plays is so experienced/good that it gate keeps new players out??

[1:57:16] TheHardkaare: @leninsshlong there's an elo system, so
[1:57:19] blotterboyy: @LeninsShlong you can play but just as everyone who is experienced you will be stuck in the worst ranks possible for years
[1:57:21] Makkeeew: group pressure
[1:57:23] MelonLordAnna: @LeninsShlong nah you can get into it easily
[1:57:25] Spryt_: @LeninsShlong no, the majority of players are low rank in league so a new player would fit right in
[1:57:42] Tyokath: looking at this gameplay i feel you can start now and easily catch up

NASA scientists confirm that the gap between Sick Nerd's jungle skills and his opponents rivals the vastness of natural wonders.
