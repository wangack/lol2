[0:49:16] Pyronorm: Is it not going to be reduced CS gold for both you and them?
[0:49:20] 9fierce9: Back to where we belong peepoCheer
[0:49:42] AkitaAttribute: It shouldn't change anything really.  Support just farms poke instead of minions?
[0:49:49] Pyronorm: But ADC cs will count towards that if they buy, as will anyone else buying
[0:49:54] Pyronorm: Might still be both both laners buy it, idk
[0:50:02] AkitaAttribute: True
[0:50:28] AkitaAttribute: Excessive needs to be defined, but that means people can game it if they knew actual numbers
[0:50:29] Pyronorm: Is it reduced gold for the execute, or just reduced gold for CS like old minion rule?
[0:50:34] p_s___: how did they fuck that up LUL
