[3:16:41] Ryusitto: Jax W RIOT
[3:16:43] toxicoboyy: what about the "Your shop" thing ? because i got limited skins with it so you can get victorious aatrox in "your shop" ?

[3:17:00] samakk0: its so funny how leftist americans tell me how good communism is when im in an eastern european concrete apartment
[3:17:06] Aarguil: communism doesn't work, capitalism might be bad for some people but it's the only system that works
[3:17:10] AllFather_s: What do you mean by human nature not supporting it
[3:17:15] Sniperfurby: @toxicoboyy you can get legacy skins but not victorious if u didnt play back then u cant get it
[3:17:20] TSMD_OW: @robo5239 that isn't the fault of capitalism, no system can just make resource NOT finite
[3:17:31] toxicoboyy: @AllFather_s we are too egoist to share equally
[3:17:33] rivenmommynutloy: @samakk0 frrrrrrr
[3:17:41] Ryusitto: press ctrl 6
[3:17:43] VampiricMaster: communism in its perfect form would have everyone satisfied because everyone would only want what they need. but since people want more then they need, it doesnt work
[3:17:44] labidiomart98: when u hited chall
[3:17:45] CozyPorcupine: I used to be pro commie but then I started using public transport and decided not everyone deserves resources :)
[3:17:46] TSMD_OW: All systems take resources and use them, and nothing can stop the fact that they will go away
[3:17:47] purplecatlel: @AllFather_s and cause the state should own everything

[3:19:36] Deserted_Crab: in communism a doctor who went to school for 12 years makes the same as mr mcdonalds worker no highschool diploma
[3:19:49] cthonautt: well look at the world rn

[3:21:50] TSMD_OW: When Soviet
[3:21:52] Adam_TheMonty: LUL
[3:21:52] Senshii01: it was
[3:22:00] c0pyto: yep
[3:22:04] c0pyto: it was
[3:22:10] toxicoboyy: @ElPekiz so dictatorship is the solution ?
[3:22:42] jamerlengo0: lol
[3:22:54] Egore4: commision
[3:22:58] purplecatlel: in my country there was a ship that crashed. a hungarian lady lied and said she was there to get the money from the company. She didn't get arrested for fraud cause at the time(don't know now) it wasn't a crime
[3:23:17] Rhaadahn: Daily commission, yes
[3:23:28] ElPekiz: @toxicoboyy why is dictatorship the other option? aristocracy is the best option for society to function properly
[3:23:30] Adam_TheMonty: So she just take the pencil and left?
[3:23:39] harazzdarkin: for soviet countries its basic thing bro
[3:23:46] mitko_senza: lets hope freak is one of them
[3:23:54] purplecatlel: @ElPekiz 1917 russia says otherwise...
[3:23:59] Ryusitto: basically
[3:23:59] angelo_g1: what is really weird is when you work you reach your daily quota  but your boss still wants you to keep working nonstop
[3:24:04] oldmatemanny: why every company over hiring
[3:24:05] Senshii01: this isn't the weirdest thing about c hungary during soviet times
[3:24:13] Alakazam_2017: they fire the average worker
[3:24:26] Rebooks: The climb to Rank 1 can only be done by the sexiest Aatrox player. Communism is good for what it stood for. Social democracy (a partei in my country) is based on it but because Capitalism works better they had to change.
[3:24:28] cthonautt: the lay off was expected and was probably a long term decision
[3:24:30] Botesztosz: they fired the one who made Smolder Ksante and Skarner rework btw

[3:25:02] mitko_senza: do u think they will kick out august?
[3:25:02] simener: @Naayil Not at all, i'm 3D artist in riot, not the best, not the worse, but still work'n here for 2.5 years
[3:25:19] toxicoboyy: @ElPekiz aristocracy is the same as capitalism litteraly an elite having all power is capitalism and just look at south korea chaebols there you have it a aristocratic country where all the poor suffer and work 69 hours a day and die of work
[3:25:23] loldimlim: @simener do you get discounts
[3:25:42] MastaLF: So why not be accountable? lol
