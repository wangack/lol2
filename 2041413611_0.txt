[0:14:16] heiserg1: i think rushing lethality item before than hydra is better
[0:14:55] heiserg1: because u are spending 1200 gold on tiamat and if your teammates dont know how to play around you you cant deal damage
[0:15:08] Codeflx: @heiserg1 its not a question :D
[0:15:12] heiserg1: or emrald elo is hell

[0:41:25] Foviack: i honestly have no idea what the fuck im building btw this season lmao
[0:41:50] XileElekt: if they have a ryze or another 100% frozen heart champ, do you go a dif rune?
[0:41:52] heiserg1: i think rushing lethality item before than hydra is better
[0:41:55] heiserg1: because u are spending 1200 gold on tiamat and if your teammates dont know how to play around you you cant deal damage

[0:43:55] XileElekt: dirk>tiamat vs tiamat>dirk
[0:43:59] heiserg1: but u cant deal enough damage like dirk in early
[0:44:08] heiserg1: ye
[0:44:56] ChaseShaco: if u care that much just go
[0:44:58] ChaseShaco: brutalizer
[0:45:01] ChaseShaco: into profane
[0:45:03] ChaseShaco: instead of tiamat

[0:49:22] labl4b: @ChaseShaco may i ask why dont u like soul fighter skin :)
[0:49:23] XileElekt: It's a farming meta @heiserg1 not a ganking meta, in high elo. Remember if you're low elo, it's always ganking meta, but high elo has a dif meta
[0:49:27] heiserg1: no if dont deal damage my teammates leaves me
[0:49:37] heiserg1: my elo suxks
[0:49:42] XileElekt: that's prob why
[0:49:46] XileElekt: high elo will know to not leave you
[0:49:52] XileElekt: but low elo is always gank meta
[0:50:36] heiserg1: but
[0:50:45] false_monk: @XileElekt That is so true. Ive been playing flexes with my friends past few weeks, and its astonishing how easly almost all the lanes are to gank. When I play soloQ, that is a whole different story
[0:50:45] heiserg1: if i gank too much
[0:50:55] heiserg1: i miss objective or cams
[0:51:00] heiserg1: camps
[0:51:12] heiserg1: i have a srs problem
[0:51:19] heiserg1: in my hea
[0:51:21] heiserg1: d
[0:51:22] XileElekt: @heiserg1 yeah, but low elo is just snowball meat, gank a lot, get fed, solo carry. In high elo, objectives matter more, because you can't solo carry as easily
[0:52:50] CESlush: mute all or don't jg in low elo, they'll literally blame you for dying in lane at 2 min in while you are on your first clear cause you' didn't gank immediately
[0:52:55] false_monk: @ChaseShaco What do you usually build after profane?
[0:53:44] nm_titanium: Omg u got fairygirl in ur team fairygirlWow
[0:53:46] nm_titanium: easy win
[0:53:54] heiserg1: i think my problem is base timings
[0:54:05] heiserg1: bc i die too often bc of this
[0:54:08] heiserg1: ig
[0:54:10] Shaco_Illusion: shaclone is still owning that rune Kappa
[0:54:29] false_monk: @heiserg1 Just watch chase and learn. Thats all. Practise what you see. If it doesnt work, watch more
[0:54:44] false_monk: And analyze what youre doing wrong
[0:55:17] heiserg1: yes ty ty
[0:55:20] TotemTed: And then chuck chase a big ole primer
[0:55:37] false_monk: I like to think what enemy jg doesnt want me to do in order for him to win, and you do exactly that
[0:56:02] false_monk: He showed top? For sure he doesnt want me to do dragon, but I will do it
[0:56:11] heiserg1: im doing it but
[0:56:13] heiserg1: always
[0:56:20] heiserg1: my one lane ints too hard
[0:56:39] heiserg1: like i lose second tower at 18
[0:56:50] gramadata: @false_monk but this does not work like that everytime..
[0:57:25] false_monk: I know the feeling, and I know the answer to that, which is clichaeye, but get better. Better part of games are winnable, if you play well, even if you have inting lane
[0:57:42] heiserg1: i agree
[0:57:47] heiserg1: i works in gold
[0:57:52] heiserg1: but not in emrals
[0:57:56] heiserg1: emrald*
[0:58:07] false_monk: @gramadata Yea of course. Its not this super strategy that takes you to chall. League is not black and white
[0:58:14] jessthemess18: Hey!
[0:58:25] false_monk: Sup jess
[0:58:42] jessthemess18: nothing much
[0:58:58] false_monk: @heiserg1 What exactly?
[0:59:11] heiserg1: winning with super inting lane
[0:59:29] gramadata: @false_monk what do u think of talon jungle
[0:59:54] false_monk: @heiserg1 But it is possible either way. Just try your best.
[1:00:05] heiserg1: and i dont wanna play jg bc of that
[1:00:25] false_monk: @gramadata One of the most annoying junglers there is. But idk how is he doing with new items
[1:00:40] false_monk: @heiserg1 You dont wanna play your best? Or what do you mean?

[1:01:26] heiserg1: i play support and my botlaner doesnt int
[1:01:36] heiserg1: and there is chance of winning
[1:01:49] haohan66: grubs must be nerfed tbh
[1:01:51] false_monk: @heiserg1 Thats the risk youre taking when playing league, especially soloQ. If it isnt for you, switch to flexes to play with friends or just normals

[1:08:51] heiserg1: that was perfext
[1:09:03] gigachadviewer228: @false_monk tiamat ofc
[1:09:26] false_monk: @laddhf Oh. Tiamat. Better wabeclear, you dont have to go 3 points in W
[1:09:28] Behemoth92: tiamat just speeds up your clear, buy it first
[1:10:01] jessthemess18: chase getting fed nice!
[1:10:18] false_monk: Talons too tho
[1:10:36] jessthemess18: yeah, sadly...

[1:13:23] S4phirr: @false_monk was also thinking about it, shouldn't be q max first?
[1:14:37] shauco: @S4phirr the cooldowns per level are so minimal it's definitely not worth
[1:14:46] shauco: I do max it second though
[1:14:47] false_monk: @S4phirr Ive been maxing Q even before this season with new items. I just prefer longer stealth to tiny tiny increase in Es damage and slow
[1:15:25] S4phirr: @shauco leveling e first?
[1:15:28] false_monk: Longer stealth has actually so much value, because many times you need just few miliseconds to backstab right from your Q.
[1:15:52] shauco: @false_monk 12 / 11.5 / 11 / 10.5 / 10
[1:16:00] Nightbot: join chaseshaco's discord using the link https://discord.gg/chaseshaco
[1:16:01] shauco: you're getting .5 seconds of extra stealth
[1:16:04] shauco: no worth brotha
[1:16:08] false_monk: It is worth
[1:16:10] shauco: @S4phirr I max e first yes
[1:16:13] false_monk: Especially when maxed
[1:16:53] false_monk: I think mad scientist maxes Q first too iirc
[1:17:36] shauco: to each their own. 70 / 95 / 120 / 145 / 170 (+ 80% bonus AD) (+ 60% AP) is just too good.
[1:17:51] shauco: plus the slows

[1:18:18] Nightbot: Follow me on TikTok for some bangers https://www.tiktok.com/@chaseshac
[1:18:26] shauco: it's 80% bonus ad lol. its definitely not just for ap
[1:18:40] shauco: dont just listen to what other people are doing btw
[1:18:51] shauco: try out all paths and decide yourself
[1:18:59] false_monk: Are you talking about E spell?
[1:19:04] shauco: yes
[1:19:13] false_monk: Since when does E scale with ad?
[1:19:18] shauco: since forever lmao
[1:19:29] false_monk: Active: Shaco throws a dagger at the target enemy that deals magic damage, Critical strike magic icon increased by 50% if they are below 30% of their maximum health, and Slow icon slows them for 3 seconds.
[1:19:36] false_monk: SInce never
[1:19:50] skinnyh8: since forever literally, scales with ap and ad
[1:19:54] cckSam: play ivern jamiUwUShake
[1:20:07] false_monk: @skinnyh8 Only AP. Many shaco mains want adaptive scaling
[1:20:14] shauco: @false_monk shows how much you know about your champ lmao
[1:20:32] false_monk: @shauco Let me open league and we will see
[1:20:44] ChaseShaco: no it deals
[1:20:46] ChaseShaco: ap damaghe
[1:20:48] ChaseShaco: it scales with both
[1:20:56] shauco: literally always
[1:20:57] shauco: thank you
[1:20:57] ChaseShaco: we want it to deal adaptive damage
[1:20:58] skinnyh8: thanks

[1:22:28] heiserg1: cuz i cant find my main problem
[1:22:32] skinnyh8: @false_monk i think it scales more with ap

[1:22:43] false_monk: @Medixz Why quiet?
[1:22:46] ChaseShaco: id coach u

[1:23:02] ChaseShaco: for coaching
[1:23:06] shauco: @skinnyh8 nah only 60% ap
[1:23:17] ChaseShaco: otherwise its not rly worth doin
[1:23:17] heiserg1: 60 dolars?
[1:23:20] ChaseShaco: yeah
[1:23:24] heiserg1: kk
[1:23:37] ChaseShaco: id ask you to record yourself playing a game
[1:23:37] heiserg1: maybe ill buy
[1:23:54] ChaseShaco: i want your pov recorded though if u decide to buy coaching

[1:24:13] heiserg1: kk
[1:24:14] ChaseShaco: it scales with ap and ad monk

[1:45:14] FulzLojik: We're the CLOWN CHASERS
[1:45:16] false_monk: @sexylich What are those?
[1:45:34] scLua: i thought we were the krazy klown klub
[1:46:08] Nightbot: join chaseshaco's discord using the link https://discord.gg/chaseshaco
[1:46:22] sexylich: Clone will follow enemy after death. Fakes E no. Proc cosmic
[1:46:29] lliottt: i didnt hear aboiut any shaco changes
[1:46:30] sexylich: now
[1:47:10] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[1:47:11] ibronto: @lliottt box will proc cosmic drive
[1:47:16] ibronto: and clone will throw a fake shiv
[1:47:25] FulzLojik: Oh shit that's nutty
[1:47:25] lliottt: im reading it
[1:47:30] false_monk: Good QoL changes. Maybe if you could actually use clone while dead, that would be cool
[1:47:31] FulzLojik: link notes?
[1:47:38] braindead_jungle: My clone usually chases people while im dead
[1:47:47] lliottt: @FulzLojik its on shacomains subreddit
[1:47:49] ibronto: idk if its in the patch notes
[1:47:55] braindead_jungle: maybe it will pick up new targets if you didn't have one before death?
[1:47:57] ibronto: but its legit
[1:48:07] lliottt: @sgdaemon someteims it bugs out and stops following when loses vision
[1:48:14] FulzLojik: Clone currently continues carrying out the last command given after you die, right?  so if it was on an enemy, it will keep doing that.  But if it was walking to a place, it will go there and stand still.
[1:48:29] sexylich: Shaco’s clone will now attack the nearest visible enemy champion within 1500 range of it when dead. Shaco’s clone will now stop to cast the fake W and will only do so within 300 units of Shaco prime. Shaco clone will stop to cast a fake E and will only do so within 575 units of Shaco prime’s E target, this also fakes a missile.
[1:48:38] braindead_jungle: Ok I see, so its more like minions with auto target
[1:48:43] ibronto: ok nice they added it to the notes

[1:49:13] ibronto: https://i.imgur.com/TazTrBy.png
[1:50:05] FulzLojik: For the longest time I've wanted to see Shaco's boxes convered to an ammo system like teemo shrooms.
[1:50:36] rememberthisnameok: Ty for the honor mr chase, gg!
[1:50:52] lliottt: @FulzLojik thats a good idea
[1:51:15] NaClandPepper: what if they remove cast time from shaco e !
[1:51:21] braindead_jungle: Kinda true, would be annoying if clone casting fake E slowed him down and out of AA range
[1:51:51] rememberthisnameok: yeah I was thinking as soon as I die once we lose cause I’ll just fall too far behind
[1:52:06] rememberthisnameok: but as soon as I died they surrendered
[1:52:22] TTrinxx: i'm assuming it still won't follow enemies into bushes like Tibbers does
[1:52:26] TTrinxx: so kinda irrelevant change?
[1:52:42] ibronto: clone also stands still when they go into stasis rn
[1:52:51] ibronto: idk if the fix applies to it
[1:53:25] FanaMore: noct ?
