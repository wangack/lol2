[0:06:04] xSuprido: polish language xd
[0:06:06] fxzues: HUH
[0:06:24] xthenyy: The wintrading is assumed because of what happened later
[0:06:28] Lpebony: @zanzaa321 You're technically watching a VoD right now if you really think about it Aware Susge
[0:06:30] blubbubb: it is Polish League
[0:06:35] tka_killerangel: Grubby had an interesting time playing Yuumi
[0:06:36] xthenyy: Not because of early game
[0:06:36] bor_ed: people on reddit were saying that the odds moved on gambling sites before the game

[0:09:06] jamesssii: howdy

[0:11:03] GHOST97915: @adamnbear1 match fixing. Someone most likely put a VERY LARGE sum of money on them to lose, even though they were BIG favourites.

[0:11:24] NoVittuZiis: @adamnbear1 finland :D
[0:11:34] GHOST97915: @adamnbear1 which in turn means that the pay out would be huge, and they were most likely promised a portion of this money for losing the game.

[0:45:02] gloww1337: @Oni_Ky LB is played in all levels of ranked lol, so you just have to adapt to your elo.
[0:45:04] Novitee: @Oni_Ky any champ is good to climb in plat. Its a you problem. I suggest updating your hardware/settings/buying coaching, investing time into watching streamers, observing what they do intricately, asking the questions. Then you will improve. Give any challenger player only janna to play and they will still get to almost challenger playing only janna mid. Bunch of fundamental stuff you dont understand, nor are aware of :)

[5:47:17] gleachmoney: i almost hit masters in backpack battles just forcing poison reaper every game
[5:47:28] mickzerofive: @bossthelevel fax
[5:47:35] bossthelevel: Billionaires never became billionaires because they were friends with everybody, they had to step on a head or two, to get on top
[5:47:57] Ty_Currency: why losed
[5:47:57] mickzerofive: actually most billionaires are born into wealth nowdays @bossthelevel wealth in the family
[5:48:10] Skydus36: @bossthelevel they had to stomp on allot of people
[5:48:25] bossthelevel: @mickzerofive yes, also Papa John has a lot of private interviews, he started this business himself.
[5:48:32] tooreidei: yeah follow the spreadsheet it helped me out
[5:48:35] BlackStripesOnOrangeFur: the spreadsheet is our lord and savior's doctrine
[5:48:42] bor_ed: spreadsheet op
[5:48:46] mickzerofive: @bossthelevel WHO
[5:48:47] bossthelevel: One thing that always comes to mind is he doesn't think trickle down economics exists, doesn't believe just because his company is doing better he should give raises to his employees
[5:48:47] PoPelly: that was a wild first message
[5:48:56] bossthelevel: Actually mentioned they should probably go to college instead of being a pizza driver

[5:50:04] mickzerofive: @ElajjazRecedingHairline isnt that how everything is? including TFT?
[5:50:17] mickzerofive: @buhhbear 1-7 brada
[5:50:23] bossthelevel: @mickzerofive that's exactly what I'm talking about. So the whole idea with USA government giving tax breaks to Giant companies? Their idea is hopefully trickle down economics is a thing, so we give the big guy a break, the big guy is going to help his little guys, who are actually making money for him do better. There's no incentive though, so he just reaps double Prophets
[5:50:32] buhhbear: @buhhbear FeelsBadMan
[5:50:37] ElajjazRecedingHairline: @mickzerofive yeah thats why its boring in terms of competitivness

[5:52:50] wacharucas7: Another Jaycee game :(
[5:52:53] bossthelevel: @skydus36 that's not what I was saying though. I was saying that big businesses get a lot of tax relief, because supposedly they are supposed to pay their workforce back equally
[5:52:55] Shattking: in what situations jayce is better than corki
[5:53:13] brenwyli: @Shattking wjen u uninstall is bttr
[5:53:13] cmon_john: @bossthelevel and they never do:)

[5:53:36] Shattking: @HelderC03 oh right!
[5:53:40] Skydus36: @bossthelevel thats funny
[5:53:45] helluvatry: @Shattking multiple ways of looking at it, but one way is jayce deals 100% ad and corki deals 80% ap
[5:53:45] bossthelevel: @cmon_john that's why I bring up that public interview with Papa john, CEO of Papa john's, explain that as a CEO and why he does not feel obligated to pay his workers more, just because he's making more money.
[5:53:53] jeiss_v: oh have u tried sunderer on jayce ! :0
[5:54:16] bossthelevel: @cmon_john literally the issue I'm trying to talk about.

[5:55:12] sickologyson: yea now he is about to be a absolute demon
[5:55:20] baghoulio: that naut skin is a bait the splash makes it look nice and crisp but its so weirdly smooth in game
[5:55:21] Chrosa: PARKOR
[5:55:22] SabreSworn: parkour for the day
[5:55:22] pwnkat: the LP mafia
[5:55:23] Lukesky444: parkour?
[5:55:25] diphardy: part of the course
[5:55:31] pwnkat: come up off that LP shawty
[5:55:45] Shattking: no way, same kalista?
[5:55:46] bossthelevel: @cmon_john correction, the only good billionaire rarely exists. I believe, at some point if you are successful enough and you can make sure your family can eat well, excess funds should go back to your community.
[5:55:49] AyeItsAyJay: @diphardy wait what
[5:55:49] comeman_pro: She will go 16/3 now so you can't say League is unbalanced game
[5:55:51] ashii__7: what item does sylas have chat
[5:56:05] bossthelevel: Like @cmon_john batman is the ideology of the best billionaire
[5:56:13] Skydus36: @bossthelevel but thats just being naive and will never happen
[5:56:13] diphardy: @AyeItsAyJay Rickyism
[5:56:22] gleachmoney: @ashii__7 kalista bind
[5:56:24] pwnkat: @bossthelevel just start fighting crimes at that point, huh?
[5:56:25] helluvatry: @ashii__7 got kalistas binding spear
[5:56:25] bossthelevel: He uses his giant wealth, to fix things. Instead of just make number go bigger, brrrrrr
[5:56:26] AyeItsAyJay: @diphardy me tiny brain cant comprehend
[5:56:36] diphardy: @AyeItsAyJay Trailer Park boys
[5:56:51] bossthelevel: @pwnkat that's the thing about Batman though, he's Rich enough, also smart enough to circumnavigate the legal system. And do what he feels is right.
[5:56:53] DonRamonBlanco: is jayce a rich boi
[5:56:59] Centrelinked: @Skydus36 if batman just used his billions to actually fund his own privately owned state-of-the-art prison with non-corrupt guards under his payroll, hes not needed anymore since they dont escape every week
[5:56:59] fatbo5: -1
[5:57:01] baghoulio: @Nez__R 100%

[5:57:04] AyeItsAyJay: @diphardy oh lmao, been too long and watched that really baked
[5:57:10] Shattking: kalista used her passive in sylas whether than her sup
[5:57:11] cmon_john: @bossthelevel in a perfect world, i agree. but let's be real, there is no ethical way to become a billionaire
[5:57:16] AyeItsAyJay: I should refresh
[5:57:21] onenightstan: why does sylas have khalista binding spear
[5:57:22] everyman322: are we being invaded by batman bots?
[5:57:28] bossthelevel: @cmon_john exactly that's why I'm bringing up batman.

[5:58:50] bossthelevel: @cmon_john for example, my mom lost her share of my grandparents land because some guy was a shrewd businessman and she admits she wasn't thinking at the time of signing the piece of paper, but essentially she sold off her rights to the land as soon as she turned 18 and trusted her cousin

[6:01:44] bossthelevel: I remember one time I did very well in blackjack, I'm a good person so I help my mom pay bills instead of pocketing it, hiring some Chinese labor forced work to make a shitload of fidget spinners at 2 cents, to sell at $5.
[6:01:53] jordanmon18: @blisspce its been like that for awhile
[6:01:56] sharunox: @blisspce was always like that makes up for no ult
[6:02:11] bossthelevel: I definitely could have become a billionaire off that s***

[6:04:36] bossthelevel: @cmon_john because the whole idea of a city-based chamber of commerce is to promote community business. I feel like if you get active with these guys, being rich from nothing is basically having connections. So you go to this chamber of commerce right, shake hands with a few people, maybe you created a deal if you own a restaurant, if you bring in a receipt from the dog groomers next door, you get a 20% discount on your entire bill. Stuff like that
