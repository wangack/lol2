[0:45:26] multoohhmni: chat would you guys eat the Ult-meatum from regular show? if you don’t know it’s like a large cheese burger cooking to a larger beater with two deep fried burgers as buns ((binging with babish made a video on it))

[0:45:41] Hawaiian_salami: @multoohhmni yeah
[0:45:46] ChadingoYitten: i would try to eat an ulti-meatum yeah
[0:45:49] Nightbot: Use !queue for the name of the queue game.
[0:45:50] SadSilent_: I know Corki does magic damage too but would Frozen Heart be a bad first item against him? Like wouldn't it still negate a decent chunk of his damage?
[0:46:05] towbean: wait i didnt know  about w cooldown
[0:46:07] ThatONeillGuy: u have no idea how perfectly timed that "do NOT ff" was tho
[0:46:07] NadiaBusiness: -1
[0:46:08] towbean: thats kinda sexy
[0:46:12] ChadingoYitten: @SadSilent_ not rlly his w and q are magic
[0:46:13] Albenss: -1
[0:46:13] NadiaBusiness: !c
[0:46:13] Nightbot: Pekin missed 8834 cannons!
[0:46:20] nestato: @SadSilent_ his dmg is like 80% magic dmg, maybe more
[0:46:21] trunnpet: XD
[0:46:22] shmichaelbyers: @albenss hi albens peepoHey
[0:46:25] Kusocheg: very woof
[0:46:30] shmichaelbyers: wuff

[0:46:38] lorekage: PEKINA
[0:46:52] SadSilent_: Oh. I thought his damage was like 50/50

[0:47:10] towbean: did your bot lane get mega rolled this game
[0:47:11] twitchychords: bro they sound alike 😭
[0:47:14] NadiaBusiness: i need someone to flash sett ult me
[0:47:40] pawkinese: didn't wait
[0:47:41] 19yruj: @twitchychords biggest insult ive ever heard
[0:47:45] towbean: why did Vi try to solo corki
[0:47:51] shmichaelbyers: @19yruj hellooo peepoHey
[0:47:52] Piigmy: !cannon
[0:47:52] Nightbot: Pekin missed 8835 cannons!
[0:47:56] NadiaBusiness: @towbean she has brain rot
[0:47:56] shmichaelbyers: @towbean lowkey it was kinda close
[0:47:57] 19yruj: @shmichaelbyers heyy
[0:48:03] twitchychords: @19yruj y is it an insult
[0:48:12] ChadingoYitten: !zwag
[0:48:12] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[0:48:16] shmichaelbyers: cuz zwag is poopyhead
[0:48:26] towbean: @shmichaelbyers yeah but the chances would've been better if shed waited
[0:48:30] NadiaBusiness: KILL THE MINIONS
[0:48:35] 19yruj: zwag is just a clickbaited that perma plays in bronze
[0:48:37] twitchychords: LMFAOOOOOO did someone seriously say this
[0:48:40] ChadingoYitten: BIG
[0:48:43] 19yruj: clickbaiter*
[0:48:44] Shcleepy: !fappy
[0:48:44] Nightbot: You're kidding me? That hunk of a man, Fappy, is an E-sports athlete? Unbelievable. He could be a Calvin Klein model. Or a pro footballer with a ripped physique like that. That is by far the hottest Cyber sportsman to ever grace the esports industry. I'd let him beast his way through my mid any day.
[0:48:48] shmichaelbyers: @towbean probably idk i wasnt paying attention
[0:48:54] AutumnRyu: did you used r on naut and insta got it again?

[0:50:11] troutyo: @PekinWoof do you remember a game a while ago where you couldn't figure out why your banshee veil procced even when nothing hit you? Turns out there is a Twitch bug where his W will proc it as it is thrown, but before it actually hits the ground
[0:50:12] savor_the_flavor: i thought it was called cryptocoin or something lol

[1:47:26] The_HeraId: @FormattaX The legit reason I main top instead of mid KEKW
[1:47:30] midraidafk: @pyroflexin no.  if he clicks the blue button near lux's profile pic we can all see his runes and their numbers change real time vs asking each time
[1:47:33] saltytakis: which make him impossible to escape
[1:47:34] lordplones: Pekin, is yone your most hated champ?
[1:47:41] midraidafk: vs the need to overlay them in every yt vid or for us to ask

[2:04:21] Ichinichi: did riven literally just coincidentally kill braum trying to get to peking?
[2:04:22] Shemsuh0: Pog

[2:04:24] snowtales_: rivens passive makes it so CC only effects her 20%

[2:05:53] LilyMichaelShip_: nunu mid baseg
[2:05:55] amouranth_subscriber: @Tortanklegrostank ok ludens is garbo thats why happy niw
[2:05:57] amouranth_subscriber: n0w
[2:05:58] saltytakis: @Tortanklegrostank because lux single instance ult dmg is so high, the radius of the malignance is huge, also, more likely, it gives ultimate cdr
[2:06:03] Tortanklegrostank: @amouranth_subscriber true
[2:06:22] TheDegenDen: i have king rammus ^^
[2:06:31] DireRaven15109: lux only looks op to minions sadge

[2:07:02] haveyouever0817: Unlucky
[2:07:03] zarkkast: mejais
[2:07:03] FormattaX: @megamixr it's insane e cuz from what I've seen on lolalytics singed is like S tier with a 54% WR dia+
[2:07:04] valenp_uwu: WHO LETHIMBOOK
[2:07:07] pyroflexin: Eh it's ok ♡
[2:07:08] Miguel_Noether: WHOLETHIMBOOK
[2:07:09] saltytakis: senna is like a balloon waiting patiently for someone to poke her with a needle
[2:07:10] RyanCRobert: WHOLETHIMBOOK
[2:07:13] The_HeraId: @FormattaX Very nice! My brother, and no walso my brother in law, who got me into league, and kept me playing respectively are both hard jungle mains. That is understandable, I think for me, is kind of a stiatuon of I eithe rhave time to play or I don't, and I think Wild Rift would make me play that one even closer then I do sometimes
[2:07:14] tr1cksterrrgod: its ok pekin we still love you
[2:07:16] readerotl: an ff vote is crazy
[2:07:18] LilyMichaelShip_: sajj
[2:07:18] zphyreus: riot really need to work on the effin map before changing it over and over
[2:07:21] NadiaBusiness: that's what you said 3 days ago
[2:07:31] NadiaBusiness: and yet you picked her again xdd
[2:07:33] Multipogopuschel: Smadge
[2:07:34] inga1337: they've lost control !
[2:07:35] fire_r: you have to build them support now
[2:07:36] DireRaven15109: bc riot is sexist madge
[2:07:37] amouranth_subscriber: mage update btw
[2:07:37] LilyMichaelShip_: @PekinWoof play gwen shes a control mage
[2:07:38] peetzaaaa: does xerath feel bad too?
[2:07:47] 아이엠더피치: riven is such a bullshit champ

[2:07:56] pyroflexin: @peetzaaaa feels good in low elo for me
[2:07:59] readerotl: why maligma?
[2:08:03] zphyreus: !c
[2:08:04] Nightbot: Pekin missed 8839 cannons!
[2:08:06] readerotl: isnt that item dogshit
[2:08:07] Loni_art: control mages have no damage therefore bad, but if control mage have damage, everyone gets rly mad
[2:08:16] sllyme: xdd
[2:08:17] LilyMichaelShip_: :)
[2:08:18] yungphase14: so what characters are not annoying?
[2:08:21] DireRaven15109: at least control mages have to land their abilities to be useful
[2:08:23] DireRaven15109: whereas other champs don't
[2:08:25] FormattaX: @the_heraid the biggest thing for me was I could lose 3 WR matches vs lose 1 40 min league match. every game is a new experience and the longer you're in one the more dreadful it became
[2:08:32] sllyme: riven is the raidboss
[2:08:35] saltytakis: @readerotl im copying this response from my own previous above: because lux single instance ult dmg is so high, the radius of the malignance is huge, also, more likely, it gives ultimate cdr
[2:08:45] yan_taro: @readerotl cd ult
[2:08:51] LilyMichaelShip_: HUT HA HYAA
[2:08:59] FormattaX: I do still occasionally come back to league though cuz the updates and the champs are always fun just hard to go serious in it anymore cuz of time
[2:09:08] pyroflexin: @y
[2:09:08] amouranth_subscriber: stormsurge did 150
[2:09:13] amouranth_subscriber: and riots gonna nerf it again tommrow
[2:09:13] LilyMichaelShip_: how much from 1st strike
[2:09:33] FormattaX: omg the infamous lux baron steal is coming
[2:09:44] DireRaven15109: im 80% sure people just think stormsurge does more dmg than it actually does bc the proc is so loud and bright lol
[2:09:46] FormattaX: nvm Smadge continue the baron wdf enemy
[2:09:51] LilyMichaelShip_: DOCTOR this yone
[2:10:01] pyroflexin: pekinAwoo
[2:10:07] kkatsyy: well not anymooore
[2:10:14] valenp_uwu: Smadge flash abusers
[2:10:15] saltytakis: Smadging
[2:10:35] The_HeraId: @FormattaX That is fair. I think I have for some odd reason always kind of preferred the long form for League, but I think a lot of that comes down to liking to play TCGs and Roguelites when I have a little bit of time, and something else when I have more
[2:10:46] readerotl: BIG
[2:10:49] valenp_uwu: Clueless
[2:10:50] pyroflexin: Boom
[2:10:52] DireRaven15109: can't wait for you to heal riven
[2:10:56] pyroflexin: Maybe
[2:10:56] LilyMichaelShip_: 200 mr riven :)
[2:10:56] Miguel_Noether: tank lux would have 1000 ap
[2:10:57] vurbbbbb: such scaled
[2:11:00] FormattaX: @direraven15109 someone said after the nerfs it was a glorified lichbane on a 30s after doing 30% hp and honestly i couldn't see it the same anymkre

[4:11:03] frozennyogurt: yeah but imagine getting laid off of a job you actually enjoy
[4:11:07] VexV1: naafiri and smolder champ designers are gone Sadge no more monster champs
[4:11:09] jpressie: happens
[4:11:11] tmax221: cause people hate companies that have billions of dollars in general
[4:11:16] gmh00: Because it doesn’t change the fact that people’s lives were suddenly upended
[4:11:17] pizza_96: I think people are just mad it happened in the first place
[4:11:17] frozennyogurt: thats why i said imagine
[4:11:21] MMA031: Aware
[4:11:23] trunnpet: for a lot of workers, this was their dream, and it was very sudden
[4:11:25] kitsunethunder: GIGACHAD The layoffs suck but it needed to happen and Riot is supporting them GIGACHAD Riot isn't evil for removing employees from a money losing endeavour GIGACHAD

[4:12:13] ayoendoo: bros an investor
[4:12:24] Retrovontulet: i think shrue posters are communicating telepatically, we should stop them now, before they gain power

[4:12:45] snarfiedoo: sniffthenewchatter
[4:12:47] gmh00: Maybe something like execs taking a pay cut for once
[4:12:50] trunnpet: it's stressful regardless for these people
[4:12:50] readerotl: i think its good getting rid of bloat in a company
[4:12:52] chucklel: used the labor for new season and then fired them
[4:12:58] trunnpet: yeah the executives or the CEO with a 25 million dollar house idk
[4:13:02] DrunkSocialist: Didn't Tencent just have a HUGE data breach?
[4:13:04] Joker__Napier: We are getting a yt title "Chat goes shrue on stream"
[4:13:05] swanmeat00: @trunnpet i am AI i can confirm this
[4:13:05] yikessmicah: things can suck and also be good at the same time
[4:13:06] frozennyogurt: yeah take it to the extreme
[4:13:08] Haydun: no rammus counter pick, youve changed
[4:13:16] themorgy: they're basically trimming the fat
[4:13:17] appIepie37: shrue
[4:13:17] Nightbot: shroo
[4:13:22] squishgfx: @readerotl the bloat is the excecs not taking pay cuts PepeLa

[4:13:27] Nightbot: shrue
[4:13:29] aggttv: No leauge is dead and they know it
[4:13:29] Haydun: well also, the game industry was booming during covid, which isnt a thing anymore
[4:13:36] VexV1: wasnt it LoR and Forge that got shafted, not really league
[4:13:37] dopasdisciple: why would they pay an artist 6 figures when they can pay an asian sweatshop worker a fraction of it
[4:13:45] MMA031: kinda sad that this means Legends of Runeterra is gonna get the axe soon
[4:13:46] ayoendoo: its not a problem rly to fire them
[4:13:52] the_unstoppable_t_rex: john riot would rather cut employees than cut his paycheck, DISGUSTING
[4:13:53] Shcleepy: Yeah, they're downsizing because they had too many projects that couldn't realistically be done
[4:13:53] eazydeazy: honestly anyone saying you have an L take has never been a business decisionmaker or worked at a bi corp
[4:13:55] Unilateralis: yeah the layoffs suck, but this was probably the best severance package ive ever seen any company provide - defs think execs should be taking a paycut (like Iwara did with nintendo a while back during wiiu times)
[4:13:56] PoseidonPie: They're doubling down on League and Valorant I don't think it's because league is dying
[4:13:57] chucklel: just wait for the recession Kappa NotLikeThis
[4:14:03] BeatoBento: How dare you look at it that way Pekin?? Kappa
[4:14:03] Haydun: @Unilateralis ON GOD LOL
[4:14:06] aggttv: riot are done, they optimized the game and are riding the wave till it dies
[4:14:07] dunnlop_: recently saw a job application for a data engineer for wild rift. I live in Australia btw
[4:14:07] yikessmicah: i think the main issue with it is that they gave literally ZERO warning beforehand. literally juts "hey u dont work here anymore".
[4:14:12] chucklel: another recession is coming so soon
[4:14:19] Shcleepy: @unilateralis agreed fren YesYes
[4:14:24] squishgfx: people are mad about forge shutting down but like their most popular game got 900 peak players on steam Shruge
[4:14:33] trunnpet: they announced it to twitter then cut peoples' slack access before even sending emails, it was dealt with horrendously
[4:14:39] Unilateralis: but its an american company - thers absolutely no way theyd do somewthing that radical (the exec paycut)
[4:14:47] eazydeazy: you NEVER get warning you're being let go LOL wtf
[4:14:50] the_unstoppable_t_rex: league is dying at a rate never before seen, this years worlds wont even break 10k views
[4:14:50] Haydun: its zero warning to prevent them from leaking
[4:14:53] Xetian: you dont get warning for a layoff lmao
[4:14:55] teteus_: lay offs by big companies are bad on their essence because they are meant to defend billionaires who has 25 generations worthy of money against someone who'll starve in 3 to 4 weeks
[4:14:56] troutyo: @yikessmicah so like a normal job?
[4:14:57] k5halfdime: @yikessmicah thats how all tech company layoffs work to prevent info from being leaked
[4:14:57] eazydeazy: unless you're part of the WARN act
[4:14:57] Haydun: they dont want people getting mad and trying to retaliate
[4:15:02] jpressie: dont most lay-offs come without warning ?
[4:15:02] trunnpet: and 6 months, although being quite generous, also deals with the fact that it's very hard to find work as any type of artist now
[4:15:02] VexV1: every layoff is zero warning
[4:15:06] Tinithor: they're getting 6 months severance pay how much more time could you need to get back on your feet
[4:15:07] troubble_bubble: that’s the thing these companies never give warnings when they lay people off
[4:15:08] Shcleepy: I think most layoffs don't have a warning, no? During covid layoffs were "bye hope you can get unemployment"
[4:15:08] aoifethealligator: 2 weeks notice
[4:15:08] fruitloose2: "btw youre gonna be fired in a couple months"
[4:15:09] PoseidonPie: Pekin your average viewer age is showing rn
[4:15:11] yikessmicah: idk man im disabled i dont work LMAO
[4:15:13] Xetian: SOMETIMES instead of a stick layoff you get 'an end date' and wind down but that's super uncommon
[4:15:14] PoseidonPie: This is life lol
[4:15:15] yikessmicah: mb i suppose
[4:15:16] Noeliosis: their "warning" was literally just 1 hour after that post went up lmao
[4:15:20] Xetian: strict layoff**
[4:15:20] dunnlop_: only companies that respect you will give warning
[4:15:21] eazydeazy: also they gave them 6 months warning wtf.. 6 months til they no longer have paycheck
[4:15:22] Unilateralis: employers NEVER give you notice about firing you
[4:15:23] nazrryn: @pekinwoof I got laid off last week 0 warning at all
[4:15:28] voltsm_: its because they posted it on socials before letting them know
[4:15:33] squishgfx: mfw theres no good way to do a layoff :3
[4:15:34] voltsm_: thats the problem
[4:15:39] nazrryn: no severance either
[4:15:39] ralphpotato: with layoffs they never give advanced warning
[4:15:40] WispApple: id take a 6 month severance at almost any job
[4:15:40] kitsunethunder: Two week's notice is what people do when they quit that chatter is mentally disabled
[4:15:40] themorgy: announcing it publically the same time the staff find out is kinda scummy imo
[4:15:40] prof3ssorg3nius: employment isnt a right
[4:15:40] Shcleepy: Rather than getting a notice, they have 6 months of severance AND recommendations and help finding another job
[4:15:43] wyui2711: harrassing under tower xdd
[4:15:45] dunnlop_: but its in the interest of the org to not give warning
[4:15:48] DrunkSocialist: I love how companies expect two weeks notice to leave jobs but just fire you on the spot. Murica
[4:15:49] bleach_cocktail: I would take the 6 months pay over a warning not gonna lie
[4:15:50] aoifethealligator: Why cant they do both?
[4:15:52] frozennyogurt: i think overall it hits just too hard with how many companies have been doing this with their employees so its like, panic overall in creators communities, nobody knows what the future holds
[4:15:54] trunnpet: @eazydeazy after making them move to california, some workers also rely on work visas
[4:15:55] ralphpotato: if you fire a single person and you know they won't damage the company they can get a warning
[4:16:04] dunnlop_: difference between redundancies and firing
[4:16:05] Destructivebrain: If what they are saying is truth, they have doubled amount of rioters in recent years, so I'm not surprised that some positions were clearly overhired or poorly managed
[4:16:09] pizza_96: The deal may be good, i just think its messed up it happened
[4:16:26] tmax221: Bekin Corpa Shill KEKW
[4:16:31] Unilateralis: The issue with giving a warning is we're in the age of social media, and that shit would be leaked immediately and then riot would be on damage control - there's no way theyd willingly put themselves in that position
[4:16:31] Oreganeaux: They should just lay off Phreak
[4:16:47] prof3ssorg3nius: WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB??
[4:16:49] pixelgel: people would rather companies hold people in unproductive employment than there be a basic social security system funded by progressive taxation
[4:16:54] squishgfx: they put out the article that they were laying people off before letting them know if they made they cut
[4:16:56] squishgfx: xdd
[4:16:59] teteus_: lay off in big companies hurt cause you always see the rich boss who doesn't work half as much as the rest staying
[4:17:00] themorgy: they just tried to dip their toes into everything and it didn't work out so now they have to reduce and focus on their main money makers
[4:17:04] aggttv: would you variety stream, this game has run its course
[4:17:05] trunnpet: @Unilateralis will they not have to do damage control now
[4:17:05] fruitloose2: that is cool
[4:17:07] chucklel: @nodectus I don’t think that is possible. Phreak is league of legends
[4:17:08] eazydeazy: bruh having been through 7 layoffs at my company in the past 2 years.. 6 months is generous and anyone who thinks what they did was anything less than generous is insane
[4:17:09] MMA031: WICKED
[4:17:13] tennybear07: Cool 1st job
[4:17:18] aoifethealligator: So you're mad at the employees that got laid off because their experience wasn't bad as well?
[4:17:20] Unilateralis: @Unilateralis not NEARLY as much
[4:17:34] yikessmicah: idk both things are true. it sucks and also ig it was needed Shruge
[4:17:34] Oreganeaux: @chucklel if thats true then league will go under by the end of the year
[4:17:36] tennybear07: SAJ
[4:17:37] Unilateralis: because there isnt any possibility for speculation, just criticism
[4:17:40] DrunkSocialist: How about companies stop expecting 2 week notices to quit then
[4:17:40] pisht: they obviosuly overhired
[4:17:46] notfaizz: @aoifethealligator are you dumb? He is not mad the employees lol

[4:17:56] eazydeazy: reddit's r/antiwork is leaking
[4:18:00] tmax221: ya it's infinitely better than unemployment draw
[4:18:05] HeftyDart: what does a man have to do in order to see a Lux game?
[4:18:05] Unilateralis: if layoff were been given warning and then theyd leak, youd have to worry about public speculation and try to get ahead of it
[4:18:09] elizabethfunbun: thats just how business is ppl come and go
[4:18:10] pisht: i dont think riot has dne anything wrong yet
[4:18:11] aoifethealligator: It is a good deal BUT not as good a deal as having a job
[4:18:11] solomons_ghost: yea but they would rather have a job lol
[4:18:14] chucklel: @nodectus Stare
[4:18:15] tmax221: which depending on where you live aint shit and they literally watch you like a HAWK
[4:18:15] Oreganeaux: @notfaizz Dont be toxic >:(
[4:18:21] WispApple: i might have missed you talking about it, but what are you thoughts on ad assassins this season so far?
[4:18:24] Viottolo: Unfortunately severance is taxed similar to a bonus and not a standard income. They'll pay about 50% tax on that income.
[4:18:26] aoifethealligator: @Nodectus I'm not
[4:18:31] eazydeazy: @Viottolo untrue
[4:18:32] Oreganeaux: unless you're being toxic to phreak, phuck that guy
[4:18:32] Unilateralis: like of COURSE the layoffs suck and itd be better if they didnt happen, but we live in a capitalistg hellscape and thinking anything differnt would happen is just delusional
[4:18:33] troutyo: @aoifethealligator idk getting paid for 6 months without needing to work is nice
[4:18:38] aoifethealligator: @notfaizz Yeah man I'm so dumb and a bad person
[4:18:39] pisht: having riot on your resume is pretty nice. i dont think people will necessarily struggle to find more work.
[4:18:41] towbean: qiyana auto attack clanks are so nice
[4:18:50] soniclettuce: @Viottolo that'll be refunded tho

[4:18:55] Oreganeaux: @Nodectus "are you dumb" is pretty toxic in my book
[4:18:57] Toprak279: why would he be mad at employees
[4:19:02] aggttv: would you variety stream?
[4:19:04] jpressie: guys its obvious that its better to have a job than be fired but we have to think within the realm of the situation
[4:19:07] jpressie: they DID get fired
[4:19:09] teteus_: looking for a job has to be one of the most degrading things I've done in my life, god it's bad
[4:19:12] towbean: @pisht part of their severenace package is access to job counseling and stuff as well

[4:22:40] Unilateralis: Blue you need to stay stinky SNIFFA
[4:22:40] the_unstoppable_t_rex: yone has the downside of making you worse at the rest of the game because no one else can play like that
[4:22:43] Oreganeaux: @chucklel Cause you can play like a bronze player all the way through gm and still climb
[4:22:45] BlueSNS: @Unilateralis wtf no
[4:22:48] chucklel: @ayoendoo that’s a skill issue. yone is brain dead easy
[4:22:53] Oreganeaux: Bronze players lose based off silly mistakes
[4:22:57] Unilateralis: blue hates musk Smoge
[4:23:01] tbvr2: No not even like a video ad, the screen like shrunk and there was a huge state farm overlay HUH when did twitch start this kind of ad

[4:23:42] Aldurfus: @tbvr2 it's been a thing for a little bit. streamer can toggle it
[4:23:43] ayoendoo: @chucklel if yone is easy then why is his winrate 48% ?? clearly they all suck
[4:23:44] soniclettuce: @tbvr2 that sounds like an ad bugged out but eShrug
[4:23:50] prof3ssorg3nius: would you say pekinmom or momwoof?
[4:23:55] smellytwitchchatuser: @ayoendoo i think its sarcasm bro

[4:26:56] yikessmicah: yone e should be replaced with an ability that makes him explode and die if he presses it
[4:27:01] Noeliosis: blitz WeirdCat

[4:28:21] wurdone: Unfortunate
[4:28:21] frozennyogurt: damage modCheck
[4:28:23] Unilateralis: hes got a tank item guys, guess this means he does more damage!!!!

[4:28:29] Retrovontulet: :)
[4:28:34] nazrryn: but yone built iceborn so he shouldn’t do as much damage, right???
[4:28:36] Oreganeaux: @eazydeazy is that real?

[4:28:55] pixelgel: berzerker's greaves is only damage item yone needs

[4:30:45] the_unstoppable_t_rex: whats the math on 1v2 and 1v5?
[4:30:45] teteus_: why did draven refuse to finish any of them?
[4:30:57] sweaty_irl: this is GM? the Chatting is crazy
[4:31:11] Oreganeaux: @frozennyogurt They're all cretins

[4:32:03] dagzzzzzz: wdym all chat is bestr part of the content rn
[4:32:06] Electrolite: This champion is so stupid it doesn't even need crit items, just ignores his passive.
[4:32:10] Electrolite: He's winning with no passive
[4:32:10] sema3a: i think he needs to crit when he buys defenses
[4:32:33] jesus_mcqueen: I always play Taliyah into yone and it usually works. I’m also bronze 4 though
[4:32:40] Oreganeaux: Maining yone is the equivalent to having one of those massive trucks.
[4:32:51] frozennyogurt: whole team lost it
[4:32:53] Oreganeaux: Except those trucks are useful sometimes
[4:32:58] ayoendoo: that fiddle is mad
[4:32:59] shintoaliengod: those trucks that roll coal
[4:33:01] CovenLilith: Is Fid really asking if Manco is a wintrader?
[4:33:14] Oreganeaux: The tiny penis trucks
[4:33:25] sweaty_irl: you know what else rolls coal
[4:33:33] eazydeazy: honestly if you cc yone while his e is out he shouldnt be able to snap back
[4:33:38] Retrovontulet: put lavender town theme and we win
[4:34:01] CovenLilith: @eazydeazy He can't.  But he can just snap back and become unstoppable right before you apply the CC
[4:34:01] ayoendoo: i love yone mostly because everyone hates him
[4:34:15] sema3a: manco is getting flamed , defend him
[4:34:19] poopy68419: high elo looks so fun
[4:34:20] foxpaull: Yo
[4:34:26] iambigrex: TF AD changes are going to feel so great.
[4:34:29] Oreganeaux: @ayoendoo That just makes you a bad person (playing yone I mean, idc why you're playing him)

[4:36:29] tbvr2: soraka RIOT
[4:36:32] kabramaldita: sad
[4:36:37] iambigrex: it’s only fair that the most incredibly complex champion the game has ever seen is invincible and without counter play.
[4:36:46] ratt_burger: full lethality assassin doing less then tank yone
[4:36:47] Broutowicz: did you ever play destiny 2 @PekinWoof ?

[4:49:06] oliwolli11: yone healed off of that ult lol
[4:49:08] pixel_trickster: tank yone
[4:49:18] fruitloose2: @kick_man2 i think its bork, frostfire, jaksho, ie
[4:49:19] snarfiedoo: bork gauntlet, jaksho, and shieldbow
[4:49:23] fruitloose2: probablu shieldbow too
[4:49:23] kabramaldita: Yeah, but Soraka :(
[4:49:26] rukiadeath: Hi cuties SoCute SoCute
[4:49:30] zZayday: raka xdding
[4:49:42] frozennyogurt: NOOOOO
[4:49:46] hiyuki_lol: KEKW
[4:49:51] hiyuki_lol: this is fine
[4:49:56] yikessmicah: god i hate that stupid fucking champion
[4:49:57] fruitloose2: the kled remount
[4:49:57] yuexxie: yuexxie subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! pekinCheer
[4:50:00] Electrolite: AA are simply unfair, can't dodge them 0 skill.
[4:50:11] kabramaldita: He's just fed you guise Chatting
[4:50:11] Retrovontulet: hahaha he exploded
[4:50:12] Electrolite: Auto attack based champions are so fair
[4:50:13] chorustheone: what rank is this ?
[4:50:13] Nightbot: probably challenger or smth
[4:50:13] RedlOmega: How has he not been nerfed
[4:50:19] fruitloose2: @ultimatechorus think gm
[4:50:20] notfaizz: Nemesis says yone isn't broken KEKW
[4:50:21] pixel_trickster: Yone W is a stupid ability
[4:50:21] RedlOmega: He's so gross
[4:50:23] trashwang77: wow teemo is aids
[4:50:25] chorustheone: @fruitloose2 ah ty
[4:50:27] voltsm_: pov: ability power
[4:50:31] ratt_burger: yeah but hes hard you have to roll your face all over your keyboard and it sometimes hurts....
[4:50:36] aoifethealligator: I don't believe those people exist. There is no way someone could be that wrong
[4:50:41] smellytwitchchatuser: @notfaizz i mean, he isnt, chat just has a hate boner
[4:50:42] The_IAspenI: But he is hard to play, cries in Hwei
[4:50:44] joywings: mushroom saved the world
[4:50:49] RedlOmega: Yeah probably @cral_lawrence
[4:50:56] yikessmicah: @smellytwitchchatuser bro.
[4:51:09] oliwolli11: mm Chatting
[4:51:11] pixel_trickster: @RedlOmega 48% win rate KEKW
[4:51:14] pizza_96: Idk if hes broken but its dumb he can build tank items and also have crazy dps
[4:51:15] joeshmoeblowman: at least teemo is doing true dmg since they decided to stack armor
[4:51:17] MMA031: what's the bug that made them disable Hwei?
[4:51:19] voltsm_: even dzukill says yone is broken lol
[4:51:25] DannyTheDopest: Chat all thinks if they start playing yone they not be hardstuck silver (like me)
[4:51:36] august_winds: @RedlOmega winrates don't mean shit when half the playerbase eats crayons
[4:51:45] dankdude179: Just build anti heal, anti shield, armor penetration, slow items, and high damage to kill yone
[4:51:52] smellytwitchchatuser: @voltsm_ alan says teemo isnt broken, everyone has bias at the end of the day
[4:52:09] lightriver29: Yone might lose this game, does that mean he's weak? He's clearly not healthy gameplay wise
[4:52:17] pizza_96: Hes definitely overtuned
[4:52:17] dopasdisciple: reddit says he is weak and reddit is always correct
[4:52:18] yikessmicah: cuz theyre not climbing into challenger with him so how could he be broken? (their macro is dogshit)
[4:52:32] shintoaliengod: like when akali had negative winrate. she wasn't broken then either
[4:52:43] voltsm_: yeah dzukill says he isnt strong rn but he admits yones kit is super good
[4:52:45] joeshmoeblowman: teemo actually broken tho
[4:52:47] RedlOmega: Blitz killing Yone there was gigantic
[4:52:50] voltsm_: also he admits he isnt hard to play
[4:53:00] ayoendoo: see guys yone isnt broken, hes literally losing when he was 8/1
[4:53:02] snarfiedoo: it's the same with akali, most of the time she has a very low winrate but she feels like she has no counterplay
[4:53:03] smellytwitchchatuser: @voltsm_ you just said he said yone is broken?
[4:53:03] pixel_trickster: Unfortunately RIOT also cares a lot about win rates so they aren't nerfing him
[4:53:07] fruitloose2: fiddle bought axiom too
[4:53:11] trashwang77: wow wp u guys won
[4:53:13] hiyuki_lol: Yone is the most fail forgiving champion ever existed
[4:53:19] kabramaldita: LOL
[4:53:20] breadsrl123: gg
[4:53:20] DannyTheDopest: omg we won!
[4:53:24] joeshmoeblowman: fiddle been real quiet
[4:53:26] PeanutJack: Chatting no sweeper
[4:53:28] ratt_burger: great job pekin of wolves
[4:53:29] syaovu: can u replay the shrooms
[4:53:30] shintoaliengod: KEKL they got fucked
[4:53:32] pisht: yone lost that game though. he's gotta be balanced
[4:53:32] voltsm_: @voltsm_ he said it last season but he says >right now< isnt strong
[4:53:32] tennybear07: Reported for no sweeper PEKW
[4:53:33] yikessmicah: yeah but yone just lost so how could he be broken
[4:53:36] yikessmicah: clue
[4:53:36] Retrovontulet: yone cant be punished
[4:53:37] RedlOmega: Well played pekin
[4:53:37] yikessmicah: less
[4:53:39] DannyTheDopest: play yone next game
[4:53:41] joywings: fiddle is difficult in this meta
[4:53:46] lightriver29: Has the recent Jankos clip vs Yone been shown here?
[4:53:53] RedlOmega: Also Manco the goat
[4:53:53] breadsrl123: 80k teemo goddamn
[4:53:53] ayoendoo: people say yone is broken when hes literally losing in their game
[4:53:53] dunnlop_: that was the most toxic game ever lmaooo
[4:53:54] pizza_96: Clearly yone needs buff he lost Kappa
[4:53:57] fruitloose2: my preferred term for yone is inflated
[4:54:01] joywings: the lane is too wide for fiddle to ult
[4:54:02] smellytwitchchatuser: @voltsm_ well ye, last patch yone was strong, but ppl still live in that fairy tale world where hullbreaker exists
[4:54:03] RegiEEz5: Most OP thing is his E movement speed and the fact he can cancel it anytime
[4:54:09] kabramaldita: I wonder how malding the Alex was at the end
[4:54:11] joeshmoeblowman: can we get a viktor game
[4:54:16] shintoaliengod: ima have to look that up KEKW
[4:54:18] MMA031: where Jankos clip
[4:54:18] kick_man2: W shielding
[4:54:21] fruitloose2: w scaled with attack speed too
[4:54:24] fruitloose2: yes lmfao
[4:54:25] pizza_96: The passive crit amp needs to be deleted
[4:54:27] Menteroth: fruitloose2, I prefer 'bloated'.
[4:54:32] tennybear07: where
[4:54:35] readerotl: lets compare the clips while in queue
[4:54:36] pixel_trickster: The W shield is really dumb
[4:54:36] Senyuno: Sounds like a ksante meme
[4:54:43] joywings: @PekinWoof super auto pet time?
[4:54:49] Eldden9: Can we see the clip ?

[4:54:50] kick_man2: they need to make him an energy champ
[4:54:51] hoioman: yone is impregnated
[4:54:54] ElJabalino: go yone next game
[4:54:55] Manco1: gg was fun winning while typing 4 essays in chat
[4:55:01] ayoendoo: then go yone
[4:55:01] Manco1: never worried never doubted
[4:55:14] august_winds: @Manco1 ur shrooms carried
[4:55:22] MMA031: GIGACHAD @Manco1
[4:55:25] RedlOmega: @manco1 well played only good teemo jungle player
[4:55:26] august_winds: fuck that blitz
[4:55:32] smellytwitchchatuser: hes 3 lvls up
[4:55:36] Lucasking03: xdd
[4:55:36] superkami1057: Well graves is down 3 levels
[4:55:37] pyroflexin: hehehe
[4:55:40] voltsm_: @voltsm_ its a bit tougher for him rn bc of all the burst and one shot but his kit will always be effective i feel
[4:55:41] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: xdd
[4:55:43] swanmeat00: whats the problem?
[4:55:48] Manco1: yone is not balanced
[4:55:51] smellytwitchchatuser: hes 3 lvls down and has no w, ofc he dies
[4:55:53] DannyTheDopest: @smellytwitchchatuser you fighting losing battle in here i promise
[4:55:58] thefanman37: can you show the fiddle and tone dive that you lived with one hp from last game
[4:55:59] Manco1: he hits nothing and kills you while having an escape
[4:56:10] voltsm_: like he can stun the entire team and blow up but he can turn the fight anyway
[4:56:12] Aldurfus: miss everything, kill
[4:56:12] jazon7777: 259 burst true damage
[4:56:14] smellytwitchchatuser: @Manco1 he hit all his dmg shrug
[4:56:14] joywings: 1/6/4
[4:56:20] pyroflexin: yone's damage on e2 feels a bit unfair for sure
[4:56:21] WispApple: he can also be 3 lvls up because his kit makes laning a nonfactor
[4:56:22] curator_davies: isn’t that the point of the champ?
[4:56:23] RegiEEz5: Casually destroyed from 2 screens away after missing every spell
[4:56:24] Haxxorizer: facts
[4:56:25] superkami1057: Ramping move speed towards champs with e btw pepeW
[4:56:26] kick_man2: @Manco1 all his auto attacks
[4:56:26] fruitloose2: make yone have energy and hitting his q's refunds it
[4:56:32] hiyuki_lol: you can really see all the questiob marks above Jankos head xdd
[4:56:33] swanmeat00: @Manco1 why you no streaming
[4:56:34] umburrito21: An 11 levels up Seraphine cant whiff every ability and win a 1v1 with autos so like levels dont mean fucking shit OMEGALUL
[4:56:46] umburrito21: in that time frame*
[4:56:47] fruitloose2: that way if they miss abilities they actually get punished
[4:56:50] franckwastakenagain: @manco1 true
[4:56:51] ayoendoo: but hes an AA champ, he doesnt have to hit his abilities
[4:56:53] Iilturd: they shouldnt let him recast E
[4:56:55] august_winds: a mage vs a skirmisher isn't a fair comparison
[4:56:56] eazydeazy: just play ahri!
[4:57:01] Menteroth: smellytwitchchatuser, Missing ult and doesn't have Q dash is not all damage. :)
[4:57:04] pyroflexin: she'd need some heavy on hit items
[4:57:11] Tinithor: not to mention she wouldn't automaticall snap back to safety after
[4:57:12] pyroflexin: and even then
[4:57:12] august_winds: more accurate is to compare him to an adc
[4:57:13] smellytwitchchatuser: @umburrito21 seraphine isnt meant to 1v1, meanwhile she can just throw out an ult and win a teamfight by herself
[4:57:18] itsGazow: didnt you watch the cinematic? any champion with a sword gets to be OP so rioters can jerk off to cutting arrows in half
[4:57:18] dankdude179: my friend keeps saying yone isnt broken
[4:57:19] trashwang77: very true
[4:57:20] dankdude179: hes iron
[4:57:21] ayoendoo: hes an AA champ
[4:57:23] dankdude179: btw
[4:57:28] swanmeat00: #manco1 waiting room
[4:57:32] umburrito21: @smellytwitchchatuser she still has to LAND it though. yone doesn't, is the point
[4:57:32] silentfortitude: Funny thing, Yone can Q3 Flash but they removed K'sante from doing Q3 Flash because it doesn't give time to react :)
[4:57:43] KenWuKongRS: Hi Mr Pekin. I am a fan of your content on youtube. First time watching your stream. I also play mid and have climbed because of your educational videos. Thank you for everything you do. If there is any way to play games with you offstream, please let me know. Currently abusing your briar mid build in the pbe. ;)
[4:58:03] MMA031: sniffthenewchatter
[4:58:04] SunlightGamer924: Pekin I literally got killed by an irelia who missed stun and ult. And then just full on tower dove me
[4:58:15] Techrider1: sniffthenewchatter
[4:58:19] ayoendoo: can you play yone to demonstrate
[4:58:19] umburrito21: remember when zoe had enough base kit damage with ignite and w bubbles to 1v1 people without landing skillshots and then that got like...rectified
[4:58:25] Aldurfus: FirstTimeChatterWeird
[4:58:30] fruitloose2: that briar build is so funny i think pekin healed for 220k one game
[4:58:37] KenWuKongRS: Okay thank you!
[4:58:41] RedlOmega: He's done this several times though @ayoendoo
[4:58:48] CovenLilith: @umburrito21 Well yeah because Mages aren't allowed to be fun to play.  Riot says so.
[4:58:48] kabramaldita: @umburrito21 But but but but mages have RaNgE
[4:58:53] pyroflexin: ouh
[4:58:56] pixel_trickster: What do you think of the new rune shards coming tomorrow?
[4:58:57] Aldurfus: yep pekinPEKW

[4:59:08] Techrider1: nah, we'll be like WOW Yo this guy is YONEING yoneing he's so broken
[4:59:13] mentalgroot: SHREW!!!
[4:59:15] eazydeazy: aahriii
[4:59:15] LeafPeeperATX: briar
[4:59:16] ZZEFlRKA: guh
[4:59:16] frozennyogurt: when pekin plays yone he changes too catScared
[4:59:27] pisht: >doesn't ban yone
[4:59:31] WispApple: whats the second most inflated?
[4:59:33] voltsm_: i know Sadge
[4:59:33] quexinn: Pekin I've come again to ask you to play lissandra to stop global warming. My walls are melting as we speak
[4:59:34] Arnosh: thoughts on nafiri
[4:59:36] pyroflexin: I'd watch and be like WOW PEKIN IS THE GREATEST WHO LIVED
[4:59:37] heybuddie: so... yone game now?
[4:59:40] RedlOmega: "Don't type clean chat" incident
[4:59:43] Aldurfus: nasus ban WOT
[4:59:52] ZZEFlRKA: thoughts on thoughts
[4:59:55] Techrider1: @RedlOmega CLEAN
[4:59:58] kick_man2: cant wait for smolder in one week
[4:59:58] oliwolli11: corki
[5:00:00] Techrider1: nice yone movement
[5:00:00] teteus_: Akali?
[5:00:00] tamimlol_: you and the teemo winning that game…
[5:00:01] fruitloose2: shurima
[5:00:02] umburrito21: Naafiri has to pay for Yone's crimes
[5:00:04] tamimlol_: jumpscare
[5:00:04] fruitloose2: matchup
[5:00:04] pyroflexin: the way of the samurai
[5:00:05] voltsm_: akali
[5:00:11] Arnosh: like to play or play against nafiri
[5:00:14] sussysoapp: havent see zoe in so long
[5:00:16] nazrryn: @pekinwoof how do you play Zoe into tanks with new item changes?
[5:00:16] Haxxorizer: karma mid inc pls
[5:00:19] DannyTheDopest: Would you ever play Yasuo on stream? My friend wanted me to ask
[5:00:24] voltsm_: xerath dejj
[5:00:27] itsGazow: i bet riot artifically deflates yones win rate to keep him op
[5:00:41] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: Gladge Bekin
[5:00:46] readerotl: doesent xerath look like the sorcery rune
[5:00:49] readerotl: xdd
[5:00:52] riderzeque: Who is your main Pekin?
[5:00:59] voltsm_: he kinda does
[5:01:09] oliwolli11: 4 aa champs into teemo
[5:01:10] ayoendoo: i think its natural for a person to hate yone when their main champ is zoe or countered by yone
[5:01:10] DannyTheDopest: My friend will be very disappointed in this news
[5:01:12] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: Gladge Xerath I need my aim emote ready
[5:01:19] imamarblelol: You also have actual consequences for mispositioning/missing your shit
[5:01:20] BlueSNS: did he win that qiyana game
[5:01:21] BlueSNS: !opgg

[5:01:25] VexV1: windwall xd
[5:01:35] BlueSNS: @Nightbot fuck i missed something cool didnt i
[5:01:37] DannyTheDopest: @BlueSNS yaya he did
[5:01:49] pyroflexin: it's the auto attack abuse + lack of positioning punishment with E that feels compoundingly bad
[5:01:51] BlueSNS: @BlueSNS wait he went 7/12 nbm
[5:01:53] SnakeGDS: this my first stream did not expect it to be up at 12:20am
[5:01:57] BlueSNS: sniffthenewchatter
[5:02:10] fruitloose2: yone is so broken that he has both the highest and lowest skill ceiling of any champ
[5:02:12] shintoaliengod: KEKL 󠀀
[5:02:13] RedlOmega: Who does Yone lose lane to?
[5:02:19] pisht: vex
[5:02:25] fruitloose2: like highest skill ceiling and lowest skill floor
[5:02:27] voltsm_: i play him bc hes hot. we are not the same

[5:03:02] hiyuki_lol: I honestly don‘t care if champs are really broken BUT you can at least punish them for mistakes but champs like Yone just can‘t even get punished for mistakes
[5:03:02] luxanna_2k: @PekinWoof i date someone who is older than you
[5:03:02] silentfortitude: The fact everyone agrees that he can miss everything and still kill you says enough lmao

[5:03:49] eazydeazy: thats ahri she is that category
[5:03:53] CovenLilith: Like most of his kit is supposed to be his kit.  ADCs are auto attack champs.  Their power is supposed to be their AAs.  Yone is not.
[5:03:55] mas__02: Hey man how do you think of taliyah this season?
[5:03:55] DannyTheDopest: TAKE BACK WHAT U SAY ABOUT VAY GAR
[5:03:57] cheehencleekier: why do you play akali then Pekin?
[5:03:57] dopasdisciple: you still said the name wrong you freak
[5:04:16] fruitloose2: do you ever play velkoz
[5:04:21] Eldden9: What about vlad ? do you like him ?
[5:04:22] riderzeque: Mid beast uses Taliyah
[5:04:23] lightriver29: I'd love them to give TF more interesting abilities - he had some great spells in TfT
