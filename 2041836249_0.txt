[2:45:29] solular: @cybershock6 you’re giving the hashinshin analogy and cherry picking stats on bad champs rn let’s talk about the 54 w/r top laners
[2:45:30] Visions_Of_V_: boots for what
[2:45:38] Barryyb: das the HORSE BABY
[2:45:44] Visions_Of_V_: opportunity
[2:45:48] Barryyb: survivin and thrivin
[2:45:49] Visions_Of_V_: BUY OPPORTUNITY
[2:45:54] Visions_Of_V_: it’ll be so good
[2:45:56] Visions_Of_V_: TRUST
[2:46:02] Cybershock6: @solular riven mains whining their way into buffing a "otp" champ into %8 pick rate %54 wr, yes.
[2:46:21] solular: I agree idk why riven got a buff was unneeded
[2:46:31] ultrafeast: need new broken item
[2:46:33] RavenousKitkat: daysNodder
[2:46:42] hamzajamal25: daysNodder
[2:46:42] c0nqeror: I want skarner buff PoroSad
[2:46:51] ultrafeast: gives att speed magic resist armor per hit
[2:46:53] Cybershock6: Cuz they whine on reddit all day, jerk into riven art and pay for skins
[2:47:04] solular: but just because stridebreaker is not great rn you can’t base an entire “top lane is bad” argument off 2 items when you can go sundered sky
[2:47:09] ultrafeast: terminus
[2:47:17] c0nqeror: @Cybershock6 doesnt sound bad Kappa
[2:47:44] solular: the problem is you look into stats and not actual gameplay that’s why riot sucks at balancing their game fuck the stats play the game
[2:47:45] innisthemenace: kindred r again
[2:48:07] Cybershock6: @solular Ok so, edge of night, an ASSASSIN item does have more hp then bruiser items. Why riot...
[2:48:11] Visions_Of_V_: kindred r op
[2:48:12] Barryyb: TEAM GO JUMP except supp

[2:48:34] Visions_Of_V_: 3 items btw
[2:48:36] Visions_Of_V_: to your 6
[2:48:54] solular: but I can say the same as to why bruiser items have more damage than adc items while having HP stats on top of it and better passives
[2:49:01] Cybershock6: @solular Is that why top lane players are dropping below support players on play rates?
[2:49:12] solular: you watch to much hashinshin
