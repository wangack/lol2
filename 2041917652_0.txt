[0:37:55] austrianpainter2: @austrianpainter2 he really wasnt. And everyone blamed flakked

[0:38:27] fljqpy: hella AP its ok
[0:38:53] WashedxUp222: LOL that ult
[0:39:02] WashedxUp222: should of held it

[0:40:28] AvariceTrades: summary: its support and top

[0:41:15] chopabear: is karmine better or worse than team mrn?
[0:41:39] fljqpy: where razork going LUL
[0:41:40] austrianpainter2: @MonteCristo I have a short answer. Saken is not LEC lvl, Upset is a mid tier adc that every season gets hyped, Cabo was already bad on VIT years ago, and Targamas isnt LEC lvl either
[0:41:46] AzureCatalyst: Team MRN was worse comparatively
[0:41:50] archie7497: What a shit nami ult
[0:41:52] e6merald6: can you ram through people with herald?
[0:41:52] AzureCatalyst: As a ClakeyD enjoyer I know this

[0:42:25] SaltineCracker94: Team mrn what a throwback
[0:42:28] hibbjibb: Evaniskus supremacy
[0:42:29] AzureCatalyst: He's forgetting about NickWu the Zed Top onetrick
[0:42:31] theknucklepuck: MegaHero

[0:42:49] Riqui__: he wasnt on Marn though
[0:42:50] SaltineCracker94: MegaZero was nasty on Olaf
[0:42:57] The_LostProphet: Is there a KC Copypasta yet I haven't been able to catch LEC live this year
[0:43:07] AzureCatalyst: ClakeyD who was a J4 onetrick and NickWu who was a Zed Onetrick
[0:43:23] frieza558: Hey monte has Nicolas Cage always been your favorite actor?
[0:43:24] stalff: @MonteCristo Cruiserthebruiser? top lane goat
[0:43:28] Respect_Dat1: i dislike how they take river vision control and then just give it all up randomly in an instant
[0:43:31] fljqpy: bunch of past peak players
[0:43:36] Syrmen: I came for the clever title
[0:43:44] AzureCatalyst: Holy Shit I forgot Nien was the ADC for that team
[0:43:47] AzureCatalyst: WHAT THE FUCK
[0:43:50] austrianpainter2: anyone remember kerp? the guy who played with a mouse ball
[0:44:00] dowiet: it seems the PSI disease has spread wildly throughout this game
[0:44:02] The_LostProphet: @AzureCatalyst That's a name I have not heard in a while
[0:44:05] Shobes572: He didn't get much attention but Gogoing is definitely one of my top lane GOATS
[0:44:11] Prepo9: What happened to Pr0lly? Haven't heard anything from him in years
[0:44:19] AzureCatalyst: Nientonsoh as the ADC for MRN actually blows my mind because I only remember him for that Elise backdoor against TSM at MLG Anaheim
[0:44:27] archie7497: This moment in the voice comms is such a shitshow
[0:44:36] AzureCatalyst: Nientonsoh then Seraph Top for CLG. The most painful era of CLG fandom
[0:44:38] theknucklepuck: that MLG Anaheim game was so hype
[0:44:48] dolanthedegen: @AzureCatalyst easily top 10 clg plays of all time
[0:44:58] AzureCatalyst: Easily
[0:45:12] fljqpy: lol razork flashed in what u want
[0:45:14] AzureCatalyst: As an OG CLG fan just seeing Nien's name brings me joy and reminds me of that Elise backdoor
[0:45:30] Respect_Dat1: he smited and it went to 88 hp
[0:45:48] aBitTooHircine: its the eu mini map trolling monte again :o
[0:46:14] AzureCatalyst: Also I forgot that NickWu was only on MRN preLCS. He was on Col during the actual LCS 2013 split lol
[0:46:39] dah777: did azir have ult or would it not matter?
[0:46:52] MissingMatter: They spent all their budget on proper 0's so they couldn't afford the full sized minimap.
[0:47:00] GelatoSquid: monte's stream is making me realize how much I'd love if there was league on every night to watch
[0:47:14] AzureCatalyst: @GelatoSquid Just watch LPL there's games every night lol
[0:47:20] AzureCatalyst: LPL bangers daily
[0:47:21] GelatoSquid: not at this timeslot
[0:47:26] AzureCatalyst: True
[0:47:29] GelatoSquid: lpl doesn't start until like 3am for east coast

[0:48:00] canyon_55: its just humanoid fking up mostly
[0:48:15] dolanthedegen: @QuackTheDuck literally nobody in the world is as good as bin jax. what a shit take
[0:48:22] fljqpy: he thinks bo is a bot or something
[0:48:23] archie7497: I'm surprised how eu played aphe milio on 14.1 but the moment they switched to 14.1b they dropped it. Was the aphelios Nerf on 14
[0:48:29] rfarleydude97: rfarleydude97 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hey Monte, great episode of SI like always! Its kinda appalling the mad reactions/defending im seeing for the Riot layoffs, imagine if you can actually get paid to suck off a billion dollar company like that lol. Keep it up tho with LFN! Its been great stuff!
[0:48:30] najafan: Xin shouldn't be buying Steraks also.

[0:48:59] Camer0n000: for the lpl its like 20 mins between games
[0:49:06] Zoht_: lec should add the prerecorded draft lcs is doing
[0:49:07] Camer0n000: at least for the blg tes series
[0:49:17] Prepo9: Bo is actually a good player, I feel really bad for him
[0:49:23] AzureCatalyst: LOL
[0:49:29] canyon_55: KC doesnt deserve yamato
[0:49:31] fljqpy: 1 week later he has aged 15 years
[0:49:34] Riqui__: aged 20 years in 2 weeks
[0:49:36] tmihee: Aware
[0:49:36] AzureCatalyst: The Yamato Supercut will be so saddening
[0:49:38] MoldyCalzone: KEKW
[0:49:38] Einganbush: Oh no, dont watch yamato in the last game
[0:49:41] WashedxUp222: LUL
[0:49:43] Lamynator: It'll be like how Obama aged while president
[0:49:46] archie7497: Day 1 of job
[0:49:48] AzureCatalyst: The last week Yamato cams in the final game was so depressing
[0:49:48] QuackTheDuck: Yamato looks so mature then I realize hes younger than me Despair

[0:52:09] Prepo9: Wait, did Targamas use Redemtion for DAMAGE? Or did I miss something?
[0:52:09] MissingMatter: But they're going to dragon now. Surely this isn't the sort of situation where the enemy might come into you.
[0:52:10] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: yeah that Gragas ult want it chief

[0:53:35] AzureCatalyst: @dolanthedegen Saken's soldier placement when KC has positioning on the Drake is actually TrollDespair
[0:53:39] SaltineCracker94: Cue the curb theme
[0:53:50] AzureCatalyst: Like his soldiers aren't even zoning people and he's not controlling space or the chokes at all

[0:56:22] dolanthedegen: not this season
[0:56:26] fljqpy: yea he should go back to LPL where people play properly
[0:56:27] SaltineCracker94: Rekkles Upset bot lane in Spring or summer
[0:56:28] archie7497: Was it necessary for gragas to tp to save azir?
[0:56:31] AzureCatalyst: Teleinting
[0:56:34] AzureCatalyst: My favorite kind of inting

[0:57:52] dolanthedegen: no fukn way
[0:57:54] archie7497: @dolanthedegen what if I said azir
[0:57:55] Thythorns: Apparently azir is saken best champ
[0:57:56] Camer0n000: i dont think upset autod a single champion
[0:58:01] canyon_55: these nami ults
[0:58:05] QuackTheDuck: nuc is a better Azir than Saken and hes a cassio one trick
[0:58:18] Syrmen: QuackTheDuck nuc was an otp qiyana back in the days
[0:58:19] AzureCatalyst: Nami ulting for the damage ez
[0:58:20] fljqpy: caliste is coming up soon, upset is just warming the seat
[0:58:31] MoonFall24: targ must be put down in game*
[0:58:33] AzureCatalyst: Wait is he nami ulting for the wave
[0:58:34] Manjiji: all the bubbles splatting on the ground

[0:58:53] Syrmen: nami ults Aware
[0:58:54] AzureCatalyst: Like that nami ulti hit 2 minions

[0:59:18] tmihee: west nami just ulting for fun i swear ICANT
[0:59:35] kerokerogrips: Monte can you review the clips of the alleged  win trading in a live league match
[0:59:36] Thythorns: We already knew last year that eu supports couldn't play Nami tho so...
[0:59:42] AzureCatalyst: Also wouldn't this be a game for a Tank Gragas? Since their only frontline is Jax right now? Is AP gragas really better for this comp?
[0:59:44] Melkerull: locket redemption ksante chad
[0:59:48] najafan: Does Targamas think Nami's ultimately is primarily an ENGAGE tool...?
[0:59:50] SaltineCracker94: @archie7497 he used one in a choke early in the game
[0:59:53] kAtz124: was Targa this bad on G2?
[0:59:55] najafan: ult*
[0:59:57] TheMommik: So we're going to have an offshoot series/playlist "Juicy Disasters" on your second channel?
[0:59:58] dowiet: further examination of the body revealed numerous holes within the brain.  This seems to be an acute case of brain rot or commonly known as PSI or player skill issue.
[0:59:58] fljqpy: bo and upset should find another team
[1:00:02] najafan: autocorrect
[1:00:07] Derpeess: have you seen tyler1's legendary rant about the cowboys
[1:00:09] Camer0n000: hummanoid was sorta running it

[1:00:20] Syrmen: nami aswell
[1:00:27] najafan: Well, do you?
[1:00:30] AzureCatalyst: Liuke gragas can disegngage the aklai and splti the aphelios from the frontline divers
[1:00:31] Syrmen: they have so much magic dmg
[1:00:35] AzureCatalyst: THAT NAMI WALL
[1:00:35] najafan: Do you have an Azir?
[1:00:38] AzureCatalyst: THAT NAMI FUCKING WAVE
[1:00:43] AzureCatalyst: WHY ARE T HEY WAVING TO ENGAGE
[1:00:45] LSDMTG: can't decide if i'm sad for bo and yamato or happy that those annoying ass kc fanboys are getting owned
[1:00:53] QuackTheDuck: at least they killed noah this time
[1:00:58] AzureCatalyst: I'm sad for Yamato
[1:01:02] najafan: @AzureCatalyst Retweet
[1:01:04] Camer0n000: i assumed going into this game cabo was gonna play gragas cause they showed him warming up on it vs bo pregame
[1:01:09] LSDMTG: (also as a frenchie they are even worse in french)
[1:01:17] FloofieBubbleBlower: cabo has the worst kp and kills per game right now
[1:01:21] najafan: No more Nami.
[1:01:35] Syrmen: LSDMTG I mean fans arent owned, they live their lives as usual, yamato and bo live a tough moment in their careers, it matters more
[1:01:35] archie7497: Ap Gragas is worse vs jax in s14 due to the lack of ability haste and everfrost removal.
[1:01:35] najafan: Remove Nami privileges from people who Wave to engage.
[1:01:48] najafan: You play Janna instead.
[1:01:54] najafan: Learn how to play the champ.
[1:01:55] fljqpy: wcyd
[1:01:59] fljqpy: ksante OP

[1:02:35] AzureCatalyst: Razork and Humanoid have shown us 3 years
[1:02:35] Writzo: You'll just get Janna insec's with ult LMAO
[1:02:37] Camer0n000: ksante when not used by syzgenda is so good at doing nothing all game than carrying late game
[1:02:41] AzureCatalyst: I don't know if they're communicating lmfao
[1:02:44] fljqpy: maybe kc needs another jgler then
[1:02:46] QuackTheDuck: I thought using comms is cheating Kappa
[1:02:46] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:02:47] crovvttv: we all know (as a european myself) that europeans dont speak the same language so I think your lying @MonteCristo
[1:03:05] LSDMTG: feels like Bo took a monkey's pawn deal "i want the best mechanic in the world" "granted you will also have the worse teams"
[1:03:12] FloofieBubbleBlower: is there a language barrier or is it just lack of comms?
[1:03:15] AzureCatalyst: I like to imagine that Cabo Saken and Targamas are just flaming Upset and Bo in french lmfao
[1:03:21] fljqpy: no ult what do
[1:03:24] najafan: You have to learn the rules before you learn when to break them.
[1:03:33] najafan: This Nami is garbage.
[1:03:37] dynamomarsh: the classic use everything in mid before objective starts
[1:03:41] AzureCatalyst: The back massager
[1:03:48] AzureCatalyst: Upset has the theragun for Oscarrinnin
[1:03:57] Prepo9: Finn - Nisqy - Trymbi/Rekkles for next split and this team might cook something
[1:03:59] kAtz124: why dat fk did Upset use his ult for fun all game?
[1:04:01] Zampeh_: part of me wants to dedicate a bit of time in soloq to learn ksante, is he considered a good soloq pick chat?
[1:04:05] Camer0n000: kc needs crownie
[1:04:09] archie7497: Why is kc still fighting. Akali has tp. it just chemtech soul. If they lose the fight at dragon it's gg
[1:04:11] fljqpy: no way they gonna cook anything
[1:04:17] Zoht_: oscarinin has growht so much since his debut
[1:04:39] frieza558: if targa lands that bubble on akali kC win
[1:04:45] Naxser: @MonteCristo I believe KC need a shotcalling support
[1:05:00] fljqpy: if u want a shotcall support u need bo and upset to say less
[1:05:11] Camer0n000: sad yamato doesnt say ban the papushka
[1:05:21] 44krieger: can barely hear anything

[1:05:55] Achadna1: what a bad call from upset
[1:05:59] Achadna1: that dive was free
[1:06:01] archie7497: Look at how many times targamas makes macro calls
[1:06:15] TheMommik: @KevnPaik Upset should learn French?
[1:06:19] kshyle: hit nami bubble challenge impossible
[1:06:24] fljqpy: lol jgler and adc talk nonstop
[1:06:24] tmihee: Targapiss muted or wat ICANT
[1:06:30] Zampeh_: I think Targamas picture is bugged, it doesnt seem to be lighting up
[1:06:36] AzureCatalyst: Ye
[1:06:36] fljqpy: they dont even listen to anyone else
[1:06:42] AzureCatalyst: I cannot understand what they are saying
[1:06:44] OvtForeverFall: the Frenchy Engish is a little hard to understand
[1:06:49] Ziggez: sakens accent is so french
[1:06:50] Melkerull: upset lul
[1:06:51] Syrmen: That gragas E LUL
[1:06:53] 44krieger: yeah me too audio is pretty low
[1:06:57] AzureCatalyst: I feel bad for Bo as a person learning english trying to understand these french accents
[1:07:13] frieza558: never knew Saken accent was so deep
[1:07:18] Camer0n000: i know theyre all speaking english but its so hard to understand

[1:07:57] Camer0n000: bos the main shotcaller but no one follows up on him
[1:07:57] TheMommik: Talking much is not good if there's no direction
[1:08:02] Thythorns: They need to all just listen to bo
[1:08:03] HeySugar: is there any western team that doesn't crowd comms?
[1:08:06] archie7497: It's so tilting. They have 5 veterans and they don't know what to do at baron wtf
[1:08:08] fljqpy: he aint calling shots lol hes just talking
[1:08:14] Respect_Dat1: they're talking at all the wrong points
[1:08:15] AzureCatalyst: Like I think Bo should be the primary shotcaller but his english isn't good enough or he isn't gettting followup from his teammates
[1:08:19] crovvttv: I like Upset but I think he has abit too much pressence in comms in the transitions before fights
[1:08:19] oo098: was there a guy screaming?
[1:08:21] Uberblacktorne: Uberblacktorne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! iwdClap

[1:09:03] beauds69: Oscar just throwing them around
[1:09:10] AzureCatalyst: Like someone asked what we do about ksante
[1:09:12] Respect_Dat1: did they just say "maybe we can end?" lmfao
[1:09:13] AzureCatalyst: And then they just let him walk in
[1:09:24] fljqpy: literallly no time given to other people, just talks over them about random things
[1:09:27] commando1814: are you thinking 14.2 changes anything
[1:09:30] AzureCatalyst: Like noone is marking anyone to help secure the smite or protect the jungler
[1:09:35] vedana9: lol
[1:09:41] Violet_Katt: Targamas is such a bot
[1:09:44] Ziggez: tbh im a targamas hater but that was close
[1:09:49] archie7497: Look how op nami ult is if you use it to disengage
[1:09:53] zer088: Very close
[1:09:56] Grimoires_: Really I feel like Cabo shows he knows what to do but isn't used to the level of play
[1:10:03] Grimoires_: And Targa is just inting
[1:10:06] Respect_Dat1: that's crazy, they make the right call to back out on several occassions and then they instead go in
[1:10:08] AzureCatalyst: Ye they're just reacting to the play
[1:10:08] fljqpy: yea just random talking
[1:10:10] AzureCatalyst: They have zero setups
[1:10:15] tmihee: Least vocal support ever jesus
[1:10:17] AzureCatalyst: They just do stuff without forethought
[1:10:17] fljqpy: just keep quiet

[1:10:40] BKrisz: PopNemo
[1:10:42] Prepo9: They have to playstyle or idea how they want to play. They just kind of wing it
[1:10:43] Violet_Katt: its always Cabo and Bo talking
[1:10:46] Camer0n000: cabo takes the top lane is an island too literally

[1:11:06] AzureCatalyst: I swear I heard him going into french when akali flanked
[1:11:07] AverageUgandan: U should make a YouTube video "how to fix KC " it will get 1mill viewers LUL
[1:11:10] dolanthedegen: they dont understand bo
[1:11:14] Syrmen: @fljqpy N
[1:11:16] Grimoires_: 100% KC would play better muted
[1:11:21] crovvttv: I think they should have Bo as a in fight caller and then Upset in other phases
[1:11:24] Syrmen: @fljqpy ? he's litteraly saying akali is coming gtfo
[1:11:24] crovvttv: Like let him talk
[1:11:24] ashenlotus: they need to listen to bo pretty much all
[1:11:26] kerokerogrips: @AverageUgandan caedrel already said hes gonna do a vod review of all kc games as well
[1:11:26] AzureCatalyst: Cabo is talking over him
[1:11:27] fljqpy: just say BACK
[1:11:29] Zoht_: no1 listens to bo feelsbad
[1:11:32] fljqpy: why are u essaying
[1:11:36] OvtForeverFall: and Cabo talks over kim
[1:11:37] crovvttv: Sakens comms are quite good though
[1:11:39] fljqpy: taking up space
[1:11:47] OvtForeverFall: him*
[1:11:47] AverageUgandan: @kerokerogrips oh LUL
[1:11:48] crovvttv: Like hes mainly just targetcalling in fights
[1:11:54] QuackTheDuck: Cabo talks over him so nobody hears the "we should back maybe"
[1:12:00] crovvttv: I think Bo
[1:12:02] Ziggez: bo was like that in comms last year, probably ptsd
[1:12:02] fljqpy: brother literally monologuing his thoughts
[1:12:05] fljqpy: shut up
[1:12:05] TheMommik: no IGL
[1:12:06] crovvttv: should be the "IGL" so to say
[1:12:14] crovvttv: or shotcaller
[1:12:20] 0RE0N: it's maybe hard to be decisive coming into stablished core roster
[1:12:20] crovvttv: Bo seemed to have great reads
[1:12:23] crovvttv: good comms
[1:12:32] Camer0n000: they shouldve done the bot dive even tho noah hit 6
[1:12:36] crovvttv: Upset had some moments where he spoke alot aswell
[1:12:38] PurificationAW: @MonteCristo first time tuning in to ur vod reviews, really nice to watch!
[1:12:39] crovvttv: like around the baron fights
[1:12:40] frieza558: too much "what should we do" "what do you think"
[1:12:40] JustBeQuiet: how many people should be shotcalling?
[1:12:44] Grimoires_: Cabo is used to talking in KC I guess
[1:12:48] Ziggez: they talk a lot with uncertainty
[1:12:50] dolanthedegen: expecting bo to have perfect comms in his 2nd language is tough tho. atleast he has right calls
[1:12:50] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:12:52] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo is KT still your favorite team even if you hate this roster?
[1:12:53] beauds69: They dont have a plan though they are not even thinking about win con
[1:12:55] AzureCatalyst: I think - Cabo + Alphari, Take out Targamas for Trymbi then just pray to god for Saken to stop choking
[1:12:59] quakespectra: even if its good or bad plays. they just need to be on the same page and commit together
[1:13:04] QuackTheDuck: Cabo Upset and Bo talks a lot, Targa doesnt say anything which is very weird for a support
[1:13:15] Violet_Katt: they should mute Cabo tbh
[1:13:17] viktor_b0ut: viktor_b0ut subscribed with Prime. 
[1:13:17] QuackTheDuck: even Jeonghoon talked more than Targa
[1:13:20] najafan: Targa needs to never play Nami.
[1:13:27] fljqpy: they just talk over targa anyway who cares
[1:13:28] najafan: Doesn't understand the champ
[1:13:29] AzureCatalyst: Oh god
[1:13:29] Syrmen: @AzureCatalyst they wont do that lol, they wil lfor sure run it back in spring
[1:13:29] Camer0n000: targ basically only called out sums and ults
[1:13:29] crovvttv: Saken I think considering the rest of the comms basically just did what he could. he was like "I wanna do this" or "Im doing this/Targeting this".
[1:13:31] Grimoires_: Targa needs to never play period
[1:13:32] AzureCatalyst: Not the malphite game Please god
[1:13:36] Einganbush: they need a trymbi for the shotcalls
[1:13:36] saberaxe: @MonteCristo What is Targamas doing then, since he has not great hands as a support for a while
[1:13:36] TheMommik: @QuackTheDuck Rich has been calling Targa a mute for years
[1:13:37] fljqpy: upset is literaly micromanaging him
[1:13:39] AzureCatalyst: NOT THE MALPHITE I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS
[1:13:43] AzureCatalyst: PLEASE GOD NO MALPHITEEE
[1:13:56] Violet_Katt: @MonteCristo best thing about you being in  an Asian timezone is that i can actually watch your streams now as an Aussie
[1:13:57] Thythorns: What does targamas contribute positively to thFrench? Bad mechanics, bad decisions, doesnt talk... Being french?
[1:13:59] zlGunitlz: ALLLL ABOARD!!!!!
[1:14:14] Syrmen: @Thythorns he's not french tho xd
[1:14:15] uhliterofcola: uhliterofcola subscribed with Prime. 
[1:14:17] QuackTheDuck: really badly is an understatement
[1:14:17] Ziggez: @MonteCristo this kcorp draft is S tier in kr / lpl for sure
[1:14:20] crovvttv: I feel like theres better dive champs for that though no?
[1:14:22] crovvttv: Like surely
[1:14:22] AzureCatalyst: I think Thorin was right about this being a Cabo choice and a comfort pick for him
[1:14:31] tiimthetrex: tiimthetrex subscribed with Prime. 
[1:14:36] Naxser: @MonteCristo Also it's a simple composition of R+R+R
[1:14:37] QuackTheDuck: he missed like 3 ults this game
[1:14:42] archie7497: The only work by committee pro team that "worked" thati saw was fnatic 2020. It was always nemesis and rekkles calling to end the play and hyli bwipo calling to continue the play. It was like selfmade existed to make a vote as he saw fit. Atleast that's how remember the voice comms of that team.
[1:14:44] th0mjeepsom: @Thythorns he's not french, he's from belgium
[1:14:48] rasmanit8252: @MonteCristo are you back in korea?
[1:14:51] AverageUgandan: LUL
[1:14:55] Violet_Katt: @uhliterofcola great reference
[1:14:56] crovvttv: lmfao
[1:15:08] uhliterofcola: lol not the 1st person to think that
[1:15:13] JustBeQuiet: how many people do u think should be shotcalling in a game?
[1:15:18] 0RE0N: Watch Maynter on KC Blue in LFL games, literally night and day with Cabo.
[1:15:31] QuackTheDuck: just bring Yamato back one game as support so they have a decisive voice
[1:15:33] Shobes572: @uhliterofcola amazing man of culture
[1:15:34] commando1814: call by committee sucks in rainbow 6 an CS
[1:15:36] 0RE0N: He played Malphite into BK Rogue
[1:15:38] Riqui__: KKona what the hell is a liter?
[1:15:41] Grimoires_: Targamas this weekend literally looked like he was choking on facecam
[1:15:48] Grimoires_: Not even hyperbole
[1:15:49] Respect_Dat1: D:
[1:15:52] commando1814: hell it even sucks ass in the nfl ( eagles / dallas
[1:15:58] callowlock: how much cola is "a hitler" of it?
[1:16:07] dolanthedegen: targamas is just not LEC level
[1:16:13] QuackTheDuck: the first game was 100% winnable
[1:16:17] riley_bruce_: what will the karmine corp obituary read I wonder
[1:16:19] archie7497: @callowlock nein
[1:16:26] 0RE0N: oh no i remember neeko ult that game
[1:16:27] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo do you think Rekkles would be a top tier support if he was in LEC?
[1:16:29] TheMommik: @Thythorns He is Belgian and from his Twitter French seems to be his preferred language
[1:16:35] 0RE0N: please don't make us see it again and skip that moment
[1:16:37] carnivalnights: Monte, is it futile to convince Reddit to listen to the Last Free Nation instead of Travis Gafford?
[1:16:53] fljqpy: they need a different jungler
[1:16:54] QuackTheDuck: its fine we learn from those right? Despair
[1:16:58] Shobes572: What if Targamas IS LEC level and the good players are the outliers LUL
[1:17:15] Manjiji: life is better is you ignore that lol reddit exists
[1:17:20] Grimoires_: Cabo can't do anything hereafter
[1:17:22] riley_bruce_: @carnivalnights yes, anyone actively seeking out Travis Gafford will be hard to reason with
[1:17:32] AzureCatalyst: @carnivalnights Don't try to convince the masses. Convince those of better taste and build your own community and following
[1:17:35] Grimoires_: Bo should cover the flashless malphite push-out tho no?
[1:17:37] Syrmen: @Shobes572 ofc he is lec level, all of kc players are lec level, you have to understand the lec level is dogshit so ofc they belong in lec
[1:17:52] Manjiji: LUL

[1:18:00] Grimoires_: @Shobes572 LMAOO
[1:18:05] riley_bruce_: @AzureCatalyst great point, this community exists on its own not in relation to others
[1:18:09] kerokerogrips: careful saying something is hitler monte dont wanna be quickshotted
[1:18:22] Shobes572: @syrmen agreed brother
[1:18:29] 0RE0N: the disaster was 6 grubbies for g2. the game ended there
[1:18:45] archie7497: @montecristo that dive was intended to just burn the flash so that when viego ganks back of the wave pushout the malphite can't survive with flash.
[1:18:48] QuackTheDuck: targa should have tank there
[1:18:51] Grimoires_: ok here Cabo is fked
[1:18:52] Camer0n000: targ was supposed to get tanj
[1:19:06] fljqpy: but they didnt wait for him to start didnt they
[1:19:16] AzureCatalyst: Targa should be tanking right?
[1:19:21] AzureCatalyst: I think Targamas cancels an auto
[1:19:25] Camer0n000: they told him to in coms
[1:19:29] Kebino: In their voice comms, Targamas was told to take aggro and then he just doesn't
[1:19:29] riley_bruce_: all KC roads lead to Targamas KEKHeim
[1:19:36] AzureCatalyst: Targamas auto is cancelled by his Q
[1:19:38] Syrmen: @Kebino aint no way
[1:19:40] TastyAMG: @Kebino xdd
[1:19:44] dolanthedegen: he also took the kill
[1:19:44] Riqui__: In the voice comms before the play they say targa tank but Bo goes in too early
[1:19:46] archie7497: Listen to the voicecomms it will explain everything @montecristo
[1:19:49] AzureCatalyst: Targamas started an auto then cancelled it with milio Q
[1:19:52] fljqpy: he was gonna take aggro lol
[1:19:53] kerokerogrips: some reason why Bo got hit by maokai ult
[1:19:54] AzureCatalyst: I just watched it
[1:20:01] riley_bruce_: thats so rough
[1:20:13] Kebino: he's just too slow
[1:20:20] kerokerogrips: how come immortals doesnt get the autopsy  treatment
[1:20:24] Writzo: Did he just auto tower?
[1:20:24] Ziggez: he was just late
[1:20:26] Writzo: He got gold
[1:20:26] Riqui__: Bo just goes too early
[1:20:29] fljqpy: vi already went in
[1:20:30] AzureCatalyst: Wait
[1:20:31] AzureCatalyst: Did he auto
[1:20:33] AzureCatalyst: the tower
[1:20:36] AzureCatalyst: I think he hit the tower
[1:20:38] riley_bruce_: him and bo just not sync'd up there
[1:20:46] AverageUgandan: Ye
[1:20:46] 999999779: @Riqui__ lol no
[1:20:50] QuackTheDuck: he just needs to TAKE aggro
[1:20:51] archie7497: Just auto the naut.
[1:20:52] Respect_Dat1: yeah he didnt even auto i dont think
[1:20:52] beauds69: Bo channeled q too early
[1:21:04] TastyAMG: @beauds69 Nope
[1:21:04] Lamynator: blaming bo for the play is crazy
[1:21:05] AzureCatalyst: LMFAO
[1:21:06] riley_bruce_: you would almost always have targamas die there
[1:21:07] Edge2G: vi flash q is awful
[1:21:07] dbird901: stop defending targamas chat
[1:21:08] dolanthedegen: anyone that thinks bo went in too early is stupid
[1:21:09] AzureCatalyst: BLAMING BO FOR THAT
[1:21:11] fljqpy: if youre not willing to wait for ur support then yea just go soloq
[1:21:15] AzureCatalyst: WHEN TARGAMAS HAS 10 MINTUES TO AUTO
[1:21:17] AverageUgandan: Should never trade spt for jgl NotLikeThis
[1:21:20] riley_bruce_: typical Bo
[1:21:23] TheMommik: we seem to have some nephews joining us
[1:21:24] Melkerull: flash is good
[1:21:25] Kebino: bo has to q flash to not get cancelled by naut
[1:21:30] Melkerull: @Kebino yep
[1:21:31] AverageUgandan: Yep LUL LUL LUL
[1:21:32] TastyAMG: WHATAREWESAYING
[1:21:34] oandten: kc has voice comm for that play on their channel. bo and upset were telling him to tank there
[1:21:38] halfling_fake: Isnt it even just worth it if milio dies instead of vi
[1:21:43] AzureCatalyst: yE
[1:21:48] QuackTheDuck: targa walks out then they redive for the naut
[1:21:52] riley_bruce_: but Monte we have to blame Bo
[1:21:53] QuackTheDuck: so easy
[1:21:54] Kebino: this is completely targamas' fault, he was slow to take aggro
[1:21:57] kerokerogrips: bros will literally come up with 10 different scenarios than blame Targa
[1:22:06] Riqui__: its on both no? milio should take aggro earlier. bo should wait for milio to take aggro
[1:22:14] fljqpy: well he didnt
[1:22:17] Violet_Katt: Bo flashed in with the unreal expectation that his teammates have hands
[1:22:18] beauds69: If no jungle they have time to wait for him to tank?
[1:22:21] zonks___: he auto'd the tower then q'd
[1:22:22] fljqpy: so u should stop
[1:22:22] saberaxe: @MonteCristo pull up a T1 dive
[1:22:23] najafan: Targamas needs to go on Janna/Soraka duty from here on out.
[1:22:25] TastyAMG: @Riqui__ No its on targamas for not playing with his brain turned on
[1:22:29] AzureCatalyst: Oh targamas hit the tower
[1:22:29] uhliterofcola: clearly yamato told him to not auto
[1:22:33] dolanthedegen: @Riqui__ lol bro
[1:22:33] AzureCatalyst: He hit the tower and then missed the q
[1:22:38] Edge2G: wasted flash
[1:22:39] saberaxe: @MonteCristo Show them a T1 dive to compare
[1:22:40] QuackTheDuck: he hit tower
[1:22:40] AzureCatalyst: That's just Targamas being terrible
[1:22:41] Grimoires_: Targamas is definitely the one who needs replacing
[1:22:47] halfling_fake: Probably a result of the messy comms
[1:22:47] 999999779: @fljqpy stop what? the dive?
[1:22:49] riley_bruce_: Targamas is actually on a different level you cannot comprehend
[1:22:51] TastyAMG: Bo haters are wild man LuL
[1:22:51] fljqpy: yea stop
[1:23:02] AverageUgandan: Yea it should never be the VI NotLikeThis
[1:23:02] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:23:19] Quintleton: If both doesn't flash doesn't hans just flash vi q?
[1:23:19] dolanthedegen: we really saying they should stop dive lmaooooo
[1:23:21] Grimoires_: but yeah cabo can't do anything about that really
[1:23:24] Quintleton: Bo*
[1:23:24] 999999779: @fljqpy so you just cant trust your teammates ever to do something?
[1:23:26] TheMommik: to the "Vi early" guys - they had 3 casters left, so even waiting for snail Targa would be dangerous as Naut+Aph could clear it
[1:23:32] QuackTheDuck: I think that play could have redove the naut if BO was still alive so it could have gone better
[1:23:47] Hi_ImPhantomere: ssumday is a free agent btw
[1:24:13] najafan: Ssumday is literally streaming rn
[1:24:24] najafan: And was streaming palworld earlier.
[1:24:33] TheFissk: 50% of cabo's contribution to this game is already done
[1:24:34] dolanthedegen: ssumday aint going to EU lmao
[1:24:39] dolanthedegen: hes too comfy in LA
[1:24:49] Hi_ImPhantomere: lets get ssumday on T1 academy to help rekkles?
[1:24:50] Respect_Dat1: @fljqpy idk with NA solo Q... yeah... it's hard to trust ur team lmao
[1:24:50] AzureCatalyst: @TheFissk Was this a 0-2-0 malphite game?
[1:24:53] Naxser: @MonteCristo in a parallel world
[1:25:02] AzureCatalyst: Was that a flash milio q?
[1:25:26] AzureCatalyst: K
[1:25:38] fljqpy: yea he can do it
[1:25:42] AzureCatalyst: K yeah he does that for the slow
[1:25:54] AzureCatalyst: So it's good but I think Viego just takes bo's topside camps and vi can't take the red
[1:26:00] najafan: Why is Targ.
[1:26:03] najafan: Why is he?
[1:26:03] The_LostProphet: I wish there was some form of clarity on how many grubs a team has.
[1:26:09] Naxser: @MonteCristo In a parallel world KC nisqy celebrate their 6 - 0 standings
[1:26:29] Camer0n000: lpl has it in the overlay too
[1:26:31] AzureCatalyst: That's 2 flashes from bot for a kill. If Yike can punish that in 5 minutes that might be a rough time
[1:26:31] TastyAMG: but that would require watching LCK
[1:26:33] TastyAMG: xdd
[1:26:37] t3lawrence: @Naxser true Sadge
[1:26:41] fatmadjokerog: fatmadjokerog subscribed with Prime. 
[1:26:43] AzureCatalyst: Wait Milio got that kill
[1:26:46] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo did u vod review TES vs BLG yet?
[1:26:46] 0RE0N: @Naxser with targa cabo still on the roster? aintnoway
[1:26:52] kraethan: I dont get how eu and na didnt put it on overlay
[1:26:55] TheMommik: That still leaves 2 lanes to salvage
[1:26:56] Syrmen: @AzureCatalyst no milio got the kill on the dive
[1:27:00] AzureCatalyst: Ah
[1:27:01] MonteCristo: !vods
[1:27:01] Moobot: @MonteCristo Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:27:04] AzureCatalyst: Vi got that kill I guess
[1:27:06] Prepo9: Imagine KC with Finn - Nisqy - Trymbi
[1:27:11] zlGunitlz: LCK > LPL?
[1:27:18] t3lawrence: it isd
[1:27:23] The_LostProphet: Grub counter on LCK, guess that's just another reason to watch the Champion Region
[1:27:25] AzureCatalyst: I think if they get that kill onto upset it's good but both kills not goign onto upset really makes this rough
[1:27:26] 999999779: @Prepo9 not finn but yeah
[1:27:28] QuackTheDuck: @Prepo9 nisqy is in SK my guy
[1:27:29] Hi_ImPhantomere: yes it is
[1:27:44] 0RE0N: i would say even LIDER would do well with Bo on this roster right now, especially with Akali in the meta which is his best champion
[1:27:46] Syrmen: how is hans sama even in cs with those 2 deaths
[1:28:09] Hi_ImPhantomere: No EDG vs RNG vod review?

[1:28:14] Prepo9: @QuackTheDuck My point is KC should've gone for Nisqy before he went to SK "my guy"
[1:28:21] archie7497: @montecristo btw did you review g2 vs heretics? They vod from that day is missing so I didn't know.
[1:28:25] TheMommik: It's so awesome that Riot has so many times added global modifiers to game and it takes esports broadcasters to mod it in for them to realise: Oh right, we should have that info up there somewhere @MonteCristo
[1:28:31] AzureCatalyst: Bo Nisqy is actualy my fucking dream for a Bo team
[1:28:35] Naxser: @0RE0N I believe Nisqy would be the voice that this team needs, because the major problem of this team is the lack of leadership
[1:28:36] 0RE0N: @Prepo9 Nisqy would change absolutely nothing if targamas and cabochard are still there
[1:28:39] Kebino: Targamas again, doesn't cleanse the naut Auto LOL
[1:28:49] AzureCatalyst: Yep not having flashes is rough but they wasted them earlier for 1 kill on hans
[1:28:55] dolanthedegen: bo nisqy actually sounds like a nasty combo
[1:28:57] Mizzzraim: pretty late milio r
[1:29:03] Prepo9: @0RE0N Thats why I suggested another top and support?
[1:29:04] archie7497: Look how late milio ults
[1:29:10] Violet_Katt: Targamas just refused to cleanse to Naut auto there
[1:29:15] Kebino: Upset survives if Targamas cleanses naut auto
[1:29:22] OvtForeverFall: so can he run away?
[1:29:27] AzureCatalyst: Oh yeah
[1:29:28] The_LostProphet: Mikey naut CC Yikes
[1:29:34] AzureCatalyst: That's a rough time for upset
[1:29:34] MannyAki: was Malphite blind picked?
[1:29:35] fljqpy: even perkz cant what would nisqy do
[1:29:36] AzureCatalyst: Not much he can do
[1:29:55] AzureCatalyst: I think Kennen was picked first
[1:29:59] TastyAMG: that milio ult was a decade late
[1:30:00] AzureCatalyst: Malphite was picked r4?
[1:30:02] dolanthedegen: the way targamas plays triggers me
[1:30:03] MannyAki: intersting..
[1:30:04] Grimoires_: did you check back on the milio ult?
[1:30:13] QuackTheDuck: @Prepo9 brother what makes you think nisqy didnt choose to play with SK
[1:30:22] AzureCatalyst: The milio ulti is lAZte but I don't thnk upset lives even if they cleanse is earlier
[1:30:28] The_LostProphet: At least they won the trade on top Kappa
[1:30:34] Kebino: Someone explain why he doesn't cleanse the naut auto?
[1:30:40] dolanthedegen: cuz hes fkn shit
[1:30:47] Grimoires_: lmao
[1:30:49] deadpoool04: you should check KC voice comms @MonteCristo
[1:30:50] deadpoool04: for week 1
[1:31:01] The_LostProphet: @deadpoool04 that's next
[1:31:07] deadpoool04: aah nice
[1:31:15] Evan_Ralston: the top lane 1v1 going on at the same time was interesting
[1:31:17] AzureCatalyst: Wait
[1:31:17] Respect_Dat1: malphiite almost got a solo kill on kennen during the bot lane fight...
[1:31:21] AzureCatalyst: Do we have a Yamatocam
[1:31:25] The_LostProphet: @deadpoool04 He's gonna review the first 3 then review with the voice after
[1:31:25] AzureCatalyst: NOOOI NEED A YAMATO CAMMON
[1:31:31] archie7497: Upset could have even ran to the tower instead of going to the alcove if milio ulted earlier
[1:31:36] AzureCatalyst: Episode 2 of Yamato Cammon
[1:31:37] AnonymousNihilist: what are the odds of 0-9?
[1:31:41] Karego: LUL
[1:31:43] fljqpy: 100%
[1:31:44] Big_Fat_Gaming: Monte, what webcam do you use?
[1:31:51] Melkerull: @AnonymousNihilist depends on rogue
[1:31:52] dowiet: yamato cannon unoperational
[1:31:54] AzureCatalyst: The only winnable game is rogue
[1:31:57] deadpoool04: naah rogue is dogshit
[1:32:03] Syrmen: @AnonymousNihilist they face rogue, so there is hope for at least a win
[1:32:07] The_LostProphet: @Melkerull :( Rogue comes back only to be mid
[1:32:14] dynamomarsh: gonna be sad when this season of KC is done after only 9 episodes
[1:32:23] zionsick: looking kwispy in that camera
[1:32:27] SirHoundSound: pre-recorded confirmed. used ai to anticipate every question
[1:32:28] Big_Fat_Gaming: If I get an Alpha 6400 will it make me look handsome too? Asking for a friend.
[1:32:47] AzureCatalyst: LUL
[1:32:54] Mizzzraim: monkaS
[1:32:54] violincake: LUL
[1:32:57] riley_bruce_: it will just enhance you
[1:33:01] fljqpy: big fat gaming = no chance
[1:33:02] Cruelscotty: That's why I use a 160p webcam
[1:33:03] Sokired: thats like 1k camera
[1:33:03] Giiino: how do i determine if im handsome or ugly
[1:33:05] AzureCatalyst: WHERE IS CABO
[1:33:06] BKrisz: :(
[1:33:08] AzureCatalyst: WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING
[1:33:08] The_LostProphet: LUL
[1:33:12] dowiet: beware the camera does not lie
[1:33:12] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:33:12] TheMommik: "Just be confident, lol" - alternate timeline Monte
[1:33:14] Grimoires_: Enhancing my ugliness? When I'm already a gremin?
[1:33:14] riley_bruce_: we were not made for tv chat
[1:33:15] AzureCatalyst: Cabo is catching the top wave crash
[1:33:20] najafan: It's an Aristotelian camera? @MonteCristo
[1:33:26] TastyAMG: @AzureCatalyst Top turret zubXDD
[1:33:29] fljqpy: no TP what u want lol
[1:33:30] Melkerull: dont think he knew neeko was close
[1:33:33] Kebino: Terrible engage by miky, then bb ints
[1:33:35] Violet_Katt: MonteCristo in 1080p 60fps goodness
[1:33:39] QuackTheDuck: this fight went well considering cabo wasnt in this fight
[1:33:40] zionsick: I wish one day I could grow to have 1% of Monte's confidence.
[1:33:47] AzureCatalyst: I want to know why he wasted his tp earlier
[1:33:51] madiiiman: when do we review the best match of all time? (KC vs VIT)
[1:33:56] Lamynator: he has the opportunity to make 150 gold, he can't pass it
[1:33:59] 0RE0N: from ad kennen
[1:34:01] TheFissk: Everyone wondered where Malpite was this game
[1:34:01] saberaxe: and he used clense
[1:34:01] AzureCatalyst: Did he need to burn his earlier tp for anything?
[1:34:01] beauds69: Contesting 4v5
[1:34:02] TastyAMG: @madiiiman asking the real questions
[1:34:04] mibnelius: Really appreciate the vod uploads as a busy east coastie - i usually have stuff going on at the beginning of streams and Twitch's vod support is garbage despite having years to get it right 🤷‍♂️ I guess they truly are good bedfellows with the Riot esports folks
[1:34:08] AzureCatalyst: Ultin bo?
[1:34:10] QuackTheDuck: BO
[1:34:11] saberaxe: yep
[1:34:11] AzureCatalyst: I think he ulted bo
[1:34:12] riley_bruce_: he has forgotten his ult is a cleanse
[1:34:13] TastyAMG: who tf knows
[1:34:14] AzureCatalyst: LMFAO
[1:34:15] Grimoires_: yes
[1:34:16] rasterroo: uhhh
[1:34:16] Grimoires_: AHAHHAH
[1:34:17] Syrmen: he ulted for bo xdd
[1:34:19] AzureCatalyst: HE ULTED BO
[1:34:20] Ziggez: ulted for healing
[1:34:21] madiiiman: Malphite is on a siesta
[1:34:22] Prepo9: I think he ults for Bo
[1:34:23] Melkerull: lul
[1:34:25] AzureCatalyst: lmfao
[1:34:27] riley_bruce_: thats epic
[1:34:28] AzureCatalyst: THIS MILIUO
[1:34:28] TastyAMG: HE'S SO BAD OH MY GOD
[1:34:30] TheMommik: IT HURTS
[1:34:31] AzureCatalyst: HE'S BURNING MY EYES
[1:34:31] tmihee: NAHHHHHHHH
[1:34:32] QuackTheDuck: wait wat
[1:34:32] AzureCatalyst: PLEASE GOD
[1:34:34] Rimmy___: Bruh
[1:34:35] Oraclon: so sad that lucian has to take cleanse when he has a milio on his team
[1:34:40] Respect_Dat1: he ulted jack shit
[1:34:42] Respect_Dat1: is what he did
[1:34:48] Prepo9: I mean for the heal on Bo
[1:34:49] Syrmen: to heal him i guess
[1:34:49] riley_bruce_: yeah but he just thinks his ult is a heal
[1:34:50] Ziggez: Its for healing
[1:34:51] viktor_b0ut: haha
[1:34:54] 0RE0N: and caps isn't killing him with ad lb there
[1:34:55] deadpoool04: he's LEC champion please treat him with respect , thank you
[1:34:55] QuackTheDuck: heal?
[1:34:57] AzureCatalyst: I think he's ulting for healing
[1:34:59] fljqpy: big heal
[1:35:02] Cruelscotty: Targodus was looking to Captain Jack the Kennen is my only guess
[1:35:03] Syrmen: i think he wasnt in range to ult upset
[1:35:05] riley_bruce_: he is still learning milio take it easy on him man
[1:35:06] madiiiman: this is so disgusting
[1:35:06] AzureCatalyst: I don't think he's utling to cleanse anything lmfao
[1:35:08] Syrmen: but he wanted to heal bo
[1:35:14] Grimoires_: imagine KC has a support
[1:35:16] TheMommik: Moral support ult
[1:35:17] Grimoires_: i can
[1:35:20] TastyAMG: Talk about confidence in your support my god LuL
[1:35:22] 0RE0N: heal bo for that? he was not in any danger there
[1:35:23] saberaxe: Targ also did not walk up fast enough for a good exhaust
[1:35:25] madiiiman: why cant KC actually be french and just surrender their remaining games
[1:35:27] madiiiman: save us the pain
[1:35:27] Karego: At least he pressed his buttons Kappa
[1:35:31] AzureCatalyst: 120hp heal on Bo EZ
[1:35:32] saberaxe: @MonteCristo I also like the late exhaust by Targ
[1:35:36] Syrmen: yike failed R
[1:35:39] Grimoires_: it can't be Trymbi on KC sorry chat, but having 4 yelling players would not help
[1:35:40] dynamomarsh: I genuinely doubt he knew he kennen was there
[1:35:51] Prepo9: That's the only thing I can think about
[1:35:52] QuackTheDuck: big chillin
[1:35:55] Zampeh_: he thought it was redemption and tried to use it for damage
[1:35:55] AzureCatalyst: LETSGO
[1:35:55] fljqpy: yea just keep slotting in more players LUL
[1:36:01] Haziri_: I dont know who I feel worse for in terms of their career now. Upset or Odo
[1:36:03] The_LostProphet: Malphite just chilling top
[1:36:13] QuackTheDuck: that was a horrible millio ult my goodness
[1:36:16] TastyAMG: @Haziri_ upset 100%
[1:36:17] TheMommik: @Haziri_ Odo is respected
[1:36:28] TastyAMG: Odo is beloved and a champion
[1:36:29] madiiiman: im convinced at this point chin actually has paid anyone who eneds up on bo's team to mercelessly int him so he never finds success since hes dodged his lpl ban by going to lec
[1:36:30] TheMommik: So Upset for sure
[1:36:31] AzureCatalyst: The AD Kennen ulti is hilarious
[1:36:33] TastyAMG: upset is neither
[1:36:34] Kinzuu: when looking at kc you have to ask at what point is comedy going too far
[1:36:35] madiiiman: china*
[1:36:49] The_LostProphet: Maybe KC just needs to play a deathball comp cause this does not look organized at all
[1:36:50] AzureCatalyst: Oh  wait this is an ap kennen ulti
[1:36:52] AzureCatalyst: Nevermind
[1:36:56] AzureCatalyst: I just thought it did zero damage lol
[1:37:08] Mizzzraim: have you seen the kc comms video?
[1:37:08] fljqpy: yea bcos millio ult healed
[1:37:15] Zelgius: @AzureCatalyst exhaust exists
[1:37:16] Haziri_: Odo is great but both just teams they end up on make you wonder what ifs
[1:37:17] t3lawrence: @Kinzuu LOL
[1:37:19] Kebino: kennen got exhausted
[1:37:23] The_LostProphet: Dang! all those grubs
[1:37:27] saberaxe: @MonteCristo Cabo has no boots minute 15
[1:37:35] kerokerogrips: can you give player ratings and graph them acorss games ?
[1:37:37] madiiiman: @Kebino to be fair playing against kc is exhausting
[1:37:39] OvtForeverFall: @madiiiman nah, his ban in lpl is just a few months, no team takes him after is the problem
[1:37:41] The_LostProphet: Wait can you redirect it lmao
[1:37:48] vedana9: what does malph even do this game..
[1:37:48] AzureCatalyst: The herald loses 700 hp from tyhe charge though so that's interesting
[1:37:49] Syrmen: missed cannon
[1:37:49] QuackTheDuck: maybe BB knows targa will fail because they played together
[1:37:50] Grimoires_: XP package delivery for upset
[1:37:50] 0RE0N: Can Upset play on sidelanes that game? Doesn't he win into both LB and Kennen?
[1:37:57] AzureCatalyst: @vedana9 I think he dies twice
[1:38:02] AzureCatalyst: And I don't believe he gets anything else done
[1:38:05] TastyAMG: @kerokerogrips Targamas stocks at an all time low
[1:38:09] Kebino: @vedana9 his job is to frontline and then ult aphelios/kennen
[1:38:16] vedana9: fair

[1:38:18] Syrmen: @0RE0N they have no dmg if he goes to sideline tho, and no tp
[1:38:22] Grimoires_: @0RE0N ad leblanc and stormsurge kennen with flash?
[1:38:45] AzureCatalyst: Lucian splitpusing instead of pressuring mid is a bad idea vs the AD LB
[1:39:03] madiiiman: the weirdest part of kc games is they shud have prob won all of them. every team they play runs it down but somehow kc just does it better
[1:39:24] Violet_Katt: i hate that Shiv Leblanc is a thing again
[1:39:25] AzureCatalyst: Woooo
[1:39:28] QuackTheDuck: @madiiiman nah nobody should have won that VIT vs KC game
[1:39:28] The_LostProphet: Oh no
[1:39:29] AnonymousNihilist: more like KC just doesnt push their advantage until they eventually lose
[1:39:29] AzureCatalyst: Time for misery
[1:39:32] AzureCatalyst: I need the Yamato Cam
[1:39:33] Ziggez: @MonteCristo more miserable than Dal's malphite?
[1:39:34] Mizzzraim: have you seen the kc comms video? @MonteCristo
[1:39:34] TastyAMG: @madiiiman i hope Targamas and cabo are getting paid well for throwing games this obviously
[1:39:37] Kinzuu: @madiiiman the vitality one was crazy
[1:39:40] viktor_b0ut: oh boy iI cannot wait
[1:39:45] AzureCatalyst: @Ziggez This malphite game makes Dal look like Zeus
[1:39:55] mibnelius: mibnelius subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Really appreciate the vod uploads to YT as a busy east coastie - I usually have stuff going on at the beginning of streams and Twitch's vod support is garbage despite having years to get it right 🤷‍♂️ I guess they truly are good bedfellows with the Riot esports folks
[1:39:57] madiiiman: you cnnot convince me targamas isnt being paid by china to int bo
[1:40:01] madiiiman: there is no other explanation
[1:40:17] TastyAMG: @madiiiman its either that or he needs to go to the hospital
[1:40:18] AnonymousNihilist: was Targamas actually good on G2 or was it just an illusion
[1:40:23] kerokerogrips: chat when is power spike
[1:40:30] 0RE0N: well KC did say it's only of the cheapest rosters in recent LEC history and they sure do play like one
[1:40:31] madiiiman: even if he wasnt good he was never this bad
[1:40:34] AzureCatalyst: Power spike is tomorrow I think
[1:40:39] Goreng: @AnonymousNihilist Or flakked is just an insane teammates
[1:40:39] TastyAMG: @AnonymousNihilist his team was cracked imo he's not a good player
[1:40:41] Syrmen: @AnonymousNihilist I mean lets not rewrite history, he was decent in g2
[1:40:49] t3lawrence: wendesday i believe
[1:40:52] Grimoires_: Summer split Targamas is a world-class support in LPL?
[1:40:55] TastyAMG: Decent in G2 says a LOT
[1:41:02] TastyAMG: You should be insane with that team
[1:41:05] gravitum_uwu: crowd same volume as the casters in the background xd
[1:41:06] QuackTheDuck: @Syrmen anything can look decent in G2
[1:41:08] Kebino: @AnonymousNihilist nah him and flakked weren't good
[1:41:09] Mizzzraim: SMOrc
[1:41:10] Melkerull: what is that ult lmao
[1:41:11] AzureCatalyst: So since Cabo wasted his TP 3 minutes earlier Neeko is forced to contest the Kennen top instead of being at drake
[1:41:12] riley_bruce_: big play time
[1:41:12] Respect_Dat1: are KC fans just paid actors?
[1:41:12] The_LostProphet: I dont like this. Every fight feels like I am about to see a train wreck
[1:41:13] ultimaterishi: @AnonymousNihilist Jankos was managing him every game
[1:41:14] MannyAki: yeah
[1:41:14] viktor_b0ut: lmao
[1:41:16] madiiiman: think about it monte. bo joins vit, and is mercelessly run down until his mental breks and HE runs it down til hes benched. now a neww team and ITS HAPPENING AGAIN
[1:41:16] Karego: ??
[1:41:17] The_LostProphet: thelos14Wat thelos14Wat thelos14Wat
[1:41:18] t3lawrence: jesus
[1:41:21] KnowP4in: YEP
[1:41:22] madiiiman: THEY ARE PAYINg HIS TEAMMATES
[1:41:22] fljqpy: got the flash 4Head
[1:41:26] Syrmen: Kebino not good for international stage, they were good in lec, sto pcoping, lec is dogshit
[1:41:29] nighkey: game_announcement
[1:41:30] shellgachi: the game was so won
[1:41:38] nighkey: _onKillFireDragon_red
[1:41:41] riley_bruce_: you dont see the vision of the great cabochard
[1:41:45] TastyAMG: oh god is this the ult i think it is
[1:41:46] viktor_b0ut: Cabo with the hold my beer moment
[1:41:47] mibnelius: 10/10 game engine
[1:41:59] t3lawrence: LOL
[1:42:01] madiiiman: no monte it is a proactive decision, and when karmine corp makes proactive decisions they lose because any active decision is botched
[1:42:01] Zelgius: Malph ult for Aphelios flash is theoretically a good trade
[1:42:04] kerokerogrips: remember when kog braum  destroyed the LEC and then got smashed at worlds
[1:42:06] t3lawrence: if you said minions
[1:42:08] AzureCatalyst: HMMM
[1:42:09] Camer0n000: no
[1:42:10] KnowP4in: naah
[1:42:11] t3lawrence: hmm
[1:42:11] Goreng: HMMMM

[1:42:14] Prepo9: Ask Smeb
[1:42:15] t3lawrence: never knew dat
[1:42:16] 0RE0N: not if it's Myrwn
[1:42:16] QuackTheDuck: they have millio
[1:42:17] AzureCatalyst: Nah AD Kennen flanks are not great
[1:42:18] Camer0n000: because i build ad kennen
[1:42:18] Kinzuu: only if its on hit xd
[1:42:19] epicalbawler: no
[1:42:20] kerokerogrips: debatable
[1:42:20] t3lawrence: never dat
[1:42:25] Karego: depends who it is Kappa
[1:42:28] Melkerull: is afk
[1:42:29] AzureCatalyst: I saw Rekkles flanking on Kennen once LUL
[1:42:34] madiiiman: kennen flanks are notoriously bad, especially around the baron pit with the mr shred
[1:42:38] The_LostProphet: just retreat it's better
[1:42:39] madiiiman: Kappa
[1:42:41] fljqpy: ult to intimidate
[1:42:49] TastyAMG: Not even Jesus Christ himself can save Cabo and Targamas lsrKEK
[1:42:49] fljqpy: got the flash
[1:42:52] Karego: He's bored tho
[1:42:56] Camer0n000: but leave is an adc that used to be on edg
[1:43:04] madiiiman: @TastyAMG jesus literally died for targamas sints
[1:43:06] Oraclon: i think the play is fine but malph goes too early
[1:43:17] AzureCatalyst: WOOOO MR
[1:43:17] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:43:21] limemarten: @Oraclon so the play is not fine lol
[1:43:25] TastyAMG: @madiiiman he can't die that many times FeelsBadMan
[1:43:25] Goreng: shouldnt they also push botwave?
[1:43:28] AzureCatalyst: THE PEOPLE
[1:43:32] AzureCatalyst: THE PEOPLE'S CHAMP!
[1:43:45] Oraclon: @limemarten sure...
[1:43:46] madiiiman: but monte mikyx cant do damage Kappa
[1:43:46] AzureCatalyst: lol
[1:43:47] fljqpy: team got baited in wcyd
[1:43:47] litixio: when is power spike? @MonteCristo
[1:43:48] AzureCatalyst: surely
[1:43:49] saberaxe: also baited the rest of the team to bail him out
[1:43:51] AzureCatalyst: Surely would be useufl
[1:44:00] Camer0n000: he burned aphelios flash tbf
[1:44:03] Lamynator: would be good if targamas used exhaust too, why didn't he?
[1:44:05] madiiiman: thats such a bad flank man, kennen is just so useless Kappa
[1:44:11] fljqpy: he got slammed lol
[1:44:13] Lamynator: oh he did at the end, nvm
[1:44:13] QuackTheDuck: why didnt TARGA flash the Milkyx FLASH
[1:44:14] quakespectra: tables will turn after voice coms
[1:44:17] AzureCatalyst: BARON TIME
[1:44:19] TastyAMG: ITS BARON TIME
[1:44:20] AzureCatalyst: BARONN TIME!
[1:44:29] Haziri_: big purple worm
[1:44:31] AzureCatalyst: GIMME A YAMATO CAM
[1:44:33] Prepo9: Saken ult was BEAUTIFUL that fight
[1:44:33] Zelgius: Saken ult Kreygasm
[1:44:35] gspotted98: @MonteCristo what are the chances KC not get 0-9 this split?
[1:44:36] AzureCatalyst: GIVE ME A LIVE YAMATO CAM PLEASE
[1:44:40] Tears_0f_sin: wtf was that neeko ult
[1:44:40] PurificationAW: XD
[1:44:41] QuackTheDuck: Targa could have flashed the milkyx flash
[1:44:42] madiiiman: monte do you BOleive in KC winning a game this split?
[1:44:43] jellyfishtrain: caboshat
[1:44:43] Komarimasita: Wooo0o0o
[1:44:45] dowiet: StinkyCheese
[1:44:46] dmw_xx: woooooo
[1:44:50] Adanion: Monte losing it in his sleep deprived state
[1:44:53] TastyAMG: Fumbled the bag
[1:44:56] AnonymousNihilist: story of their life
[1:44:57] thelasts1lence: Couldn't KC players all flash to the right side of jungle? Malph was fine there, why they forced a fight after they got Aphe's Flash?
[1:44:58] dynamomarsh: All of that was Bo's fault btw
[1:45:02] AzureCatalyst: gimme a yamato reaction
[1:45:04] madiiiman: the w is very heavy
[1:45:06] AzureCatalyst: I NEED A YAMATO REACTION PLEASE
[1:45:08] fljqpy: did nobody say to fuck off
[1:45:08] madiiiman: and their arms are tired
[1:45:15] Kinzuu: okay but does walking away get you aphelios flash? didnt think so
[1:45:17] Mizzzraim: fight SMOrc
[1:45:18] najafan: (And Cabo is building wrong again)
[1:45:23] madiiiman: monte the w has two sharp points on the bottom, its painful to hold
[1:45:25] Oraclon: i mean G2 bot is trollig by walking that far up. KC should lead with vi and look to ult aphelios with vi and if it looks good stack on the aphelios
[1:45:26] Syrmen: @madiiiman I unironically kc is better than rogue so far
[1:45:26] AnonymousNihilist: if they had a permanent yamato cam LEC viewership goes up 30%
[1:45:32] Syrmen: think*
[1:45:37] AzureCatalyst: @najafan Well Cabo needs to deal with Kennen splitting so it's not terrible
[1:45:51] TastyAMG: all KC had to do was walk away from their top, mid, and support
[1:45:53] The_LostProphet: Is this american football? Because man look at these throws!

[1:51:30] The_LostProphet: MALPH ULT
[1:51:34] The_LostProphet: :D
[1:51:34] AzureCatalyst: hE WASTED HIS ULTI TO STOP IT THOUGH

[1:52:16] TastyAMG: @TheMommik Based
[1:52:25] sota_cat: saken never lands the no hands combo
[1:52:31] Kebino: I think malph should just follow tp

[1:52:40] scamdemic19: ahahahahahahahhaahha karmine corpse autopsy, thats fkn GOLD

[1:53:28] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/

[1:53:38] Syrmen: @Kebino I mean, the kennen is tronger than malph no?
[1:53:54] madiiiman: monte watch bo that entire fight
[1:54:01] 0RE0N: so this was the best counter pick KC had into Kennen? Just so he can ult Aphelios once in entire game to bait his team into dying?
[1:54:02] AzureCatalyst: Kennen at fight is better than malphite at the fight unless he gets a 5 man malphite knockup
[1:54:03] madiiiman: q auto auto auto auto q auto auto auto q auto q wall
[1:54:14] Kebino: @TastyAMG no because kennen channels tp first, he can't stop malph tp
[1:54:26] Prepo9: I think they can win that fight of Upset doesnt go into the dragon pit
[1:54:29] madiiiman: thats what ikm saying
[1:54:30] TastyAMG: @Kebino Then its even worse if he lets kennen TP
[1:54:35] scamdemic19: is targamas mute? their voice coms is literally a chinese import just telling 4 wards what to do
[1:54:38] sota_cat: saken solo ult miky for？
[1:54:44] madiiiman: he can 1v1 the enemy adc and his tewam cant win
[1:54:45] AzureCatalyst: Letting kennene TP means that his entire team takes like 500 damage and gets stunned
[1:54:50] Kebino: @Syrmen yeah but with malph ult, exhaust and milio ult they have a good chance to outplay
[1:54:58] madiiiman: hes in hell
[1:55:00] Mizzzraim: @scamdemic19 yeah he graduated from a mime school
[1:55:09] TheMommik: @Syrmen Have you seen this malphite?
[1:55:10] scamdemic19: @Mizzzraim LMAO
[1:55:11] AzureCatalyst: @madiiiman True
[1:55:19] TheFissk: I'm not sure why you pick a team fight champ like malp then never teamfight
[1:55:19] The_LostProphet: @Kebino Yes but you've seen milio this game. I dont have faith they can pull that off
[1:55:20] TastyAMG: @Mizzzraim he's doing a great job at pretending to be a LEC player!
[1:55:28] fljqpy: its just mikyx
[1:55:30] Zelgius: @madiiiman they won the fight 6k down what are you talking about lol
[1:55:39] AzureCatalyst: BOOOOOOOOO

[1:55:50] Syrmen: bo was rly good this game
[1:55:51] zen__cloud: Bo is the only good player on KC
[1:56:03] Mizzzraim: i dont think most of us here are blaming bo
[1:56:04] madiiiman: i think there was some confusion. i was saying bo is the only person with a brain
[1:56:07] Lamynator: I feel like this game confirms that Bo is in ELO hell
[1:56:11] fljqpy: and///
[1:56:19] quakespectra: I am actually only hearing praise for bo.  I think most sane people know he is playing well
[1:56:19] Syrmen: @Mizzzraim some kc fans wish they had cinkrof instead of bo
[1:56:25] AzureCatalyst: Saken died
[1:56:28] Camer0n000: i mainly hate bo cause of how adamant thorin is that hes better than yike
[1:56:32] reformedchater: watch KC replace him with Pyosik next year
[1:56:32] AzureCatalyst: How did saken die
[1:56:36] scamdemic19: bo probably thinking "i know i can play in LPL but playing in LEC is worse than not playing at all"
[1:56:37] AzureCatalyst: Can we watch the minimap
[1:56:41] AzureCatalyst: And see how Saken died there
[1:56:41] Mizzzraim: @Mizzzraim yeah but i dont think most of kc fans watch monte LUL
[1:56:54] 0RE0N: But bo died more than anyone on KC that game, he is clearly the problem Kappa
[1:56:57] AnonymousNihilist: @Camer0n000 I think yike could look worse if he was on KC
[1:57:01] madiiiman: @AzureCatalyst his health hit 0
[1:57:06] sota_cat: how many voids grubs g2 get this game？
[1:57:15] The_LostProphet: @sota_cat too many
[1:57:17] AzureCatalyst: I think they got 6
[1:57:17] TastyAMG: @Camer0n000 i mean he just is better than yike
[1:57:22] AzureCatalyst: But I could be wrong
[1:57:32] deft4691: I thought KC did win on Sunday
[1:57:34] madiiiman: @TastyAMG bo is 100% better than yike its not even a debate
[1:57:35] TheMommik: @Camer0n000 Yike is good but he is on G2 and with Mikyx. We'll see how good he actually is when he is away from them. And I'd also like to see Bo to play with a team not soloQ
[1:57:41] AzureCatalyst: WOPOOO
[1:57:43] AzureCatalyst: ASSIST FOR THE MALPHITE
[1:57:47] AzureCatalyst: WE GOT AN ASSIST WOOOOOO
[1:57:49] Violet_Katt: was that really worth his flash

[2:05:14] Violet_Katt: Bo is legit begging them to come
[2:05:20] Birbmang_: how many words has targamas spoken so far, 10?
[2:05:38] fljqpy: ahh yes viego is fun champ
[2:05:38] corgilames: Is this depressing?
[2:05:38] Syrmen: @Birbmang_ "yeah i tank"

[2:05:57] dmw_xx: who is kameto?
[2:05:58] madiiiman: its kameto
[2:06:00] mv_peter: I don't think cabo expected his ult to hit there if I'm honest
[2:06:03] hydranjea: bot gap xdd

[2:06:56] AzureCatalyst: sAKEN AND CABO have no uti right now
[2:06:57] hydranjea: its all so iffy lol
[2:07:00] tmihee: @SingedLFT17 that bum just wanna farm impression from kc fans
[2:07:07] Grimoires_: Cabo can say the same things in like a quarter of the words he actually uses
[2:07:09] AzureCatalyst: Yeah they havce to do baron but they have no malphtie ulti and neeko ulti vs kennen and LB
[2:07:14] madiiiman: all im getting from these coms is that there are too many people trying to shotcall the midgame and they need to just let bo dictate all rotations
[2:07:15] AzureCatalyst: It's fucking rough
[2:07:28] The_LostProphet: They have to baron or else G2 breaks inhibs and then barons themselves
[2:07:47] vriesea97: OMEGALUL
[2:07:53] sota_cat: no choice
[2:07:56] Karego: 31 minutes for a kill participation! Pog

[2:08:44] madiiiman: ok vit kc time
[2:08:45] madiiiman: i beg
[2:08:47] Respect_Dat1: upset calls for dive but noone wants to
[2:08:49] QuackTheDuck: its ok it was FNC and G2 those are top tier teams
[2:08:50] TastyAMG: Targamas speaks at all the wrong times and none at the right times its so insane
[2:08:53] killerwhalekj: KC 0-9 record will go down in history
[2:09:00] sota_cat: upset call the engage，but people flame bo brainless engage
[2:09:12] Clyde1500: RaccAttack so much trash
[2:09:15] mv_peter: Cabo def needed to play with the team there last fight, too much hesitation
[2:09:19] SingedLFT17: oh no targamas ashe incident
[2:09:23] Syrmen: targamas ashe lvl 1 is not it LUL
[2:09:28] Camer0n000: this game is sorta just fed aphelios and elyoya hits every r on saken
[2:09:29] fljqpy: 10th place yet again
[2:09:32] QuackTheDuck: the most slient ashe ever
[2:09:37] madiiiman: oh this is the targamas ashe game
[2:09:41] dynamomarsh: @SingedLFT17 fuck I forgot about this game....
[2:09:45] hydranjea: @madiiiman aware
[2:09:49] 0RE0N: Considering Cabo is the player he is, what should KC have picked into Kennen there?
[2:09:56] fljqpy: even perkz cant carry these bums
[2:10:04] AnonymousNihilist: will MAD make Worlds again this year?
[2:10:05] 0RE0N: Was Ornn banned?
[2:10:10] TastyAMG: @0RE0N a different top laner
[2:10:19] Lucallia: @TastyAMG lmao
[2:10:23] TheMommik: Poke lvl 1 is even @MonteCristo
[2:10:27] Syrmen: @AnonymousNihilist probably not
[2:10:28] madiiiman: the more buttons targamas has available to press the worse it gets for him
[2:10:44] madiiiman: i dont want to watch it monte it hurts
[2:10:46] hydranjea: lol
[2:10:46] dynamomarsh: lets just never use hail of blades I guess
[2:11:03] TastyAMG: @dynamomarsh Targamas's level 1 this game was criminal
[2:11:35] TastyAMG: They win this lane so hard if Targamas wasn't first timing ashe
[2:11:36] Syrmen: so weird
[2:11:38] hydranjea: bo is so elo helled lol
[2:11:39] sota_cat: cuz cait ashe is losing lane this point of time，xdd
[2:11:42] Syrmen: its like they dont have voice coms
[2:11:51] Karego: Oh no. The condition cabo has, it's contagious
[2:11:55] AzureCatalyst: We can watch the KC voice coms
[2:11:55] hydranjea: targa is awlays quiet lol
[2:11:56] sim337: This feels like soloQ ngl
[2:11:58] Respect_Dat1: yeeees just get those minions upset
[2:12:01] Lucallia: bo scouts, bo comes to cover, bo loses nearly all his health. This is Bo's fault /s
[2:12:04] TigerXN1: there is no world in which they should ever be down xp
[2:12:05] TastyAMG: Watch what Targamas does at level 1
[2:12:08] TastyAMG: @MonteCristo ^
[2:12:19] zionsick: This bot blow
[2:12:21] zionsick: s
[2:12:25] madiiiman: it legit looks like upset wasnt expecting his jungler to be competent
[2:12:28] sota_cat: how the fuck you have double counter still losing lane
[2:12:30] FunkyKimble: Uppset is tilted
[2:12:33] Oraclon: cait never has damage to kill anyone there btw....
[2:12:35] direpants2: hitting minions more important duh
[2:12:44] TheMommik: poke is even at lvl 1, tragic
[2:12:45] TastyAMG: He started playing at the top of the wave rather than the bush and didn't auto
[2:12:46] Camer0n000: @madiiiman hes played with him for a full year now
[2:12:46] madiiiman: he doesnt use hail or blades a single time
[2:12:51] MiIkMan: he wanted lvl 3, its fine to take the fight
[2:12:52] Lucallia: Upset still tilted from getting abandoned by the malphite tank last game
[2:12:56] TastyAMG: and doesn't use HoB
[2:13:05] TheMommik: this is the useless ARAM Ashe
[2:13:07] QuackTheDuck: why even pick ashe
[2:13:13] madiiiman: targamas doesnt even have a hail of blades auto til level 3
[2:13:18] hydranjea: @TheMommik LMFAO realll
[2:13:19] golgito: If no hob might as well use comet LUL
[2:13:21] Cruelscotty: they crash wave 2 which gave enemy first to level 3 by wave 4
[2:13:23] sota_cat: taga  can literally 1 v 2
[2:13:27] Respect_Dat1: ashe needs to auto minions if she's not auto-ing the enemy champs too so they can push
[2:13:38] AzureCatalyst: The enemy team all inns
[2:13:50] AzureCatalyst: Renata moves up with the wave
[2:13:50] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:13:57] hydranjea: fr
[2:13:58] Mizzzraim: Talk? nahh
[2:14:10] Karego: they got scared of incoming gank?
[2:14:29] Zelgius: They don't know if he's in tri or walking up to them I guess
[2:14:32] MiIkMan: @Karego they are not scared, how they act is just split
[2:14:47] hydranjea: "just use ur words" xd
[2:14:50] Lucallia: communication is for try hards
[2:15:01] FunkyKimble: Uppset tilted by 0-2, I dont see other stuff
[2:15:04] TastyAMG: They saw the Sej as well its so insane
[2:15:04] Respect_Dat1: crazy thought.... what if they actually didnt see Sejuani over the ward lmfao @MonteCristo
[2:15:36] madiiiman: upset is behaving as though they dont know sej is there
[2:15:39] Lamynator: do you think mdk would've attempted diving if he didn't show?  Seems like a great opportunity to countergank under tower
[2:15:41] madiiiman: until bo sees them in tri
[2:15:41] hydranjea: am i crazy or does cait and HOB ashe + xin not shit on aphelios renata and the pig???????
[2:15:49] MiIkMan: if you commit to use flash for the fight when you see sej on ward you should be fine.
[2:16:08] juanfra8203: Ah the legendary Targamiss game
[2:16:29] theancientdreamer: @MonteCristo maybe upset said to wait for lvl 3 but they just dont listen to each other
[2:16:39] madiiiman: my best explanation is bo wards, sees sej, doesnt say something because it should be obvious. upset for one reason or another doesnt know sej is in tribrush (either didnt hear bo or bo didnt say it) and doesnt peel back to help on the play
[2:16:51] hydranjea: ^
[2:16:54] QuackTheDuck: yeah alvaro had to flash
[2:17:02] QuackTheDuck: to even get there
[2:17:02] Oraclon: they cant win because cabo saken and targamas are not used to  play on this level
[2:17:03] sota_cat: whats kc 3 french men's rank lp？cabo is diamond，what about saken tagamas
[2:17:21] hydranjea: @madiiiman botlaners lock screened looking at the wave move towards them lol
[2:17:33] 0RE0N: @sota_cat Cabo actually reached masters 50 lp, come on KEKHeim
[2:17:44] d_kowalski: A Boopsie?
[2:17:52] Professional_Aellith: Watching Karmine makes me feel better about my ARAM games.
[2:17:57] madiiiman: @hydranjea i dont have any other expolanation for upsets movement there. even if he wanted level 3 he could have drifted up and qd the wave while closer to bo
[2:18:11] hydranjea: yeah.....its so weird
[2:18:13] Syrmen: cabocahrd flashes nothing
[2:18:14] Oraclon: true but ashe doesnt know what makes her champion a strong support
[2:18:16] Respect_Dat1: WITH A KILL ON CAIT
[2:18:26] sota_cat: @0RE0N at the the g2 game hes diamond 1 i saw the video
[2:18:29] hydranjea: that flash...
[2:18:39] theancientdreamer: @MonteCristo i leveling w on azir normal?
[2:18:44] madiiiman: @sota_cat cabo is not diamond
[2:18:49] madiiiman: an account may be but hes not
[2:18:49] weak_mental_renekton: dom said cabo 2 waved crashed instead of 3 + cheater recall, therefore he lost lane without item advantage
[2:18:52] Camer0n000: you cant even use the players are outclassed this game cause didnt kcorp just beat movistar in eu masters

[2:19:00] Grimoires_: Bo has to do all the work and take all the flame
[2:19:15] fljqpy: @Camer0n000 cinkrof > bo Kappa
[2:19:19] Lucallia: bo trying to spoon feed bot while bot tries to put a fork into an outlet
[2:19:20] hydranjea: bo is the meme of that guy sweating and clicking, his botlaners are busy dancing to miley cyrus
[2:19:26] kerokerogrips: does bo make more mistakes than the average lec jungler ?
[2:19:26] Syrmen: @Grimoires_ you cant look bad and die if you do nothing and wait for the end of the game passively
[2:19:32] TheMommik: Dom also flamed the hell out of the Ashe lvl 1
[2:19:56] madiiiman: Bo is the inverse Brock Purdy. he is a #1 pick on a team of shitters who recieves all blame and no credit, rather than the final pick of the draft on a stacked roster who gets all blame and no credit
[2:20:02] Grimoires_: @Grimoires_ must be nice do be Upset, for once you play well on a bad team, and there's someone else sharing his predicament
[2:20:05] MiIkMan: @kerokerogrips far from it
[2:20:06] Grimoires_: to*
[2:20:14] 0RE0N: They designed entire draft for picking this botlane
[2:20:19] TheMommik: @MonteCristo KC took double Renata E whilst trading into the shield
[2:20:23] d_kowalski: @grimoires_ KC Fans love forgetting he was their best player in most games, because they can't admit that their LFL stars are at best big fish in a tiny pond
[2:20:34] TastyAMG: @kerokerogrips no and its not even close
[2:20:36] SingedLFT17: like what yamato can draft for this team so they win they just cant
[2:20:46] t3lawrence: yamato has been drafting pretty well i thought
[2:20:57] Syrmen: @d_kowalski I mean on this game I dont think any kc fans thinks their lfl players are the good parts of the team
[2:20:58] madiiiman: @TastyAMG the difference between bo and the next best lec jungler is quite frankly astronomical
[2:20:59] Oraclon: you simply dont give your D4 toplaner jax...
[2:21:03] madiiiman: in a vaccuum
[2:21:06] Grimoires_: you're getting more of this don't worryu
[2:21:07] Kida23: point blank miss LUL
[2:21:08] 0RE0N: @SingedLFT17 to be fair cabo can't play these champions and yamato should know his boy cabo better than anyone
[2:21:13] saberaxe: @MonteCristo If you have watched T1 Challengers Rekkles is currently a better support than Targamas
[2:21:15] madiiiman: crownie hits that
[2:21:15] L1am_Maynee: he has cleanse too XD
[2:21:15] thelasts1lence: That arrow hit me across the ocean
[2:21:17] TastyAMG: @madiiiman Yea he should be in a top tier LPL team but he's not
[2:21:18] Einganbush: this is just the beginning of them
[2:21:22] madiiiman: even crownie hits that arrow
[2:21:25] TheFissk: Ashe ults landed so far: 0
[2:21:31] hydranjea: also maybe its just me, i stg theres no way bo is understanding the heavy accent + french that is being said lmfao
[2:21:32] dynamomarsh: is there a champ that doesn't use ult? Targamas should use that
[2:21:34] mortosderp_: that a really bad arrow
[2:21:34] Karego: LOL he jsut stands there like 'wut?'
[2:21:37] TastyAMG: The west should be grateful we get to have him
[2:21:37] MiIkMan: should always be on the top side so he has to backstep
[2:21:38] TheMommik: @TastyAMG Handswise, maybe. Map plays and enabling - you have Jankos
[2:21:42] Grimoires_: Comet Counter: 1
[2:21:42] d_kowalski: @syrmen sure, but would they be fine with taking the necessary steps and agree to axe Cabo, Saken, Targa? Highly doubt it
[2:21:43] Vexzelofc: i cant remember what team they played but the one where bo was on lilia, saken on trist was an absolute perfect draft from yamato. Three winning lanes + jungle AND scaling and they still lost
[2:21:44] Respect_Dat1: and the best of all... he was slowed from the Ashe W
[2:21:46] geo2044: What do people even see in targamas
[2:21:53] Lucallia: @saberaxe that bar is subterranean
[2:21:54] madiiiman: @dynamomarsh nidalee support
[2:21:55] Mile1234567890: I saw that ult go past my window
[2:21:59] Vexzelofc: targarmas is a giga inter
[2:22:00] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips yea but feels like his mistakes (and everyone else to be fair) are hyper analyzed but i guess thats par the course when your team is winless
[2:22:01] Clyde1500: Bo and upset gotta train the next generation of french players in 1 split Kappa
[2:22:23] Writzo: the flash timing is unreal
[2:22:26] madiiiman: bo literally trying to 1v9, killing enemy adc between 2 turrets
[2:22:29] Writzo: 1 second off of supa flash coming up
[2:22:33] hydranjea: i woulda cleard that whole wave if i was bo lmfao
[2:22:39] madiiiman: also bo timed that flash
[2:22:44] Syrmen: @d_kowalski ofc tehy wont be fine lmao, yeah the team is trash atm but i think they will keep the roster for atleast spring, and if its a disaster again they 'll change for summer
[2:22:45] madiiiman: he knew he had 5 seconds to kill
[2:22:46] MiIkMan: the voice coms for this game is sad
[2:22:55] QuackTheDuck: cabo shouldnt have died there
[2:22:58] LazyFuzai: upset  the only one with 100%KP  befire that dive top
[2:23:00] fljqpy: ahh yes akali what aa shit champ
[2:23:00] Grimoires_: cabo played that really well tho
[2:23:02] TastyAMG: @TheMommik he's also speaking in a second language playing with players who are 2 tiers below the players he should be playing with
[2:23:17] saberaxe: @MonteCristo r2 came out and stormsurge killed him
[2:23:17] thelasts1lence: He could've lived he greeded for damage on Akali for w/e reason
[2:23:20] Yuiieeee: He could have just run away
[2:23:25] RomanticCreampie: akali killing through all that mr wtf
[2:23:36] kerokerogrips: how different would this team be if they had an easier strength of schedule and started off the split with one win
[2:23:42] hydranjea: 2 ults lol
[2:23:50] madiiiman: that play from bo is fine
[2:23:58] madiiiman: he has to try
[2:23:58] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:23:59] Respect_Dat1: WHY DONT THEY WALK UP WITH HIM
[2:24:00] TastyAMG: Flash and TP plus two ults
[2:24:06] MiIkMan: i think jax e might be worse than the fact that he greeds for dmg
[2:24:06] Zelgius: He should've stopped chasing the cleanse/flash aphelios earlier
[2:24:12] TastyAMG: They kill the turret if they walk up with Bo
[2:24:16] TastyAMG: FeelsBadMan
[2:24:18] TheMommik: @TastyAMG Yeah, and that is translating into weaker gameplay, sadly. He was better in FPX, he has potential to be again, but nah.  Also, Jankos managed to compensate his ass team better - it is his strength after all
[2:24:25] madiiiman: bot lane was late to the play or tower dies
[2:24:33] professor_wormbog_: Supa flashed as well
[2:24:47] 1DeepBlue: and now they get Akali's TP
[2:24:53] 1DeepBlue: that's a lot of resources
[2:24:57] Oraclon: cabo dies to akali R2
[2:24:59] Lucallia: I'm surprised Bo still goes to bot with how much they've let him down
[2:25:11] tooeasytoforget: @MonteCristo Any thoughts on the Polish win trading allegations?
[2:25:14] AzureCatalyst: Yamato's aged like 5 years
[2:25:16] AzureCatalyst: Since the last cam
[2:25:16] sota_cat: if kc bo walk up to cover bo，at least 1 for 1 + tower，no？
[2:25:20] Vexzelofc: @TheMommik jankos is a veteran 10+ years in europe with experience speaking english and leading teams, its not a fair comparison to bo
[2:25:21] TastyAMG: @Lucallia He knows its his only win condition
[2:25:22] Kida23: LUL
[2:25:22] madiiiman: @Lucallia farming aphelios and trying to get upset fed is their only win con
[2:25:23] Writzo: now Yamato wants to fucking go away from KC
[2:25:27] 0RE0N: @MonteCristo cabo build good there?
[2:25:27] AzureCatalyst: He's in like Office Worker Dad Polo with a blue pen he's munching on
[2:25:32] SaltineCracker94: Oof
[2:25:32] Grimoires_: Comet Counter: 2
[2:25:35] Yuiieeee: Let's fking go... back to LFL Aware
[2:25:38] josefino10: yamato after Aware
[2:25:47] weak_mental_renekton: I haven't seen an arrow land
[2:25:48] AvariceTrades: targamas might as well have leveled e more and left R unskilled
[2:25:55] hydranjea: targas playin soloq and listening to music xd
[2:25:56] fljqpy: its yuumi time
[2:25:57] naocorrijo: cant believe ppl are making excuses for a guy thats died 34 times in 6 matches lol
[2:25:58] Respect_Dat1: if it hit aphelios maybe
[2:25:59] madiiiman: but monte have you considered targamas doesnt know his own mid laners ult timer? Kappa
[2:26:01] LazyFuzai: @MonteCristo Any thoughts on the Polish win trading allegations?
[2:26:19] AzureCatalyst: Hehe
[2:26:29] Grimoires_: he'll have a lot of chances to increase the comet counter
[2:26:37] 0RE0N: Cabo and Targamas also don't look like they are trying to win
[2:26:38] Camer0n000: targamas did the id rather go 0-30 than 0-9 cause it means you stopped trying
[2:26:40] kerokerogrips: trying hard not to win , i thought you were talking about the polish team not KC
[2:26:56] Grimoires_: Cabo and Targamas ultraliga champions?
[2:26:57] AzureCatalyst: aND INSTANTLY DIED
[2:26:57] QuackTheDuck: at what cost
[2:26:59] Oraclon: yes i love this arrow
[2:27:01] Karego: but why?!?!
[2:27:03] madiiiman: @kerokerogrips bo is shoeless joe jackson trying to win while his entire team has been bribed to throw the world series
[2:27:05] fljqpy: o7
[2:27:06] Syrmen: they just cant flash an akali E
[2:27:06] TastyAMG: BUT WAIT
[2:27:08] TastyAMG: THERE'S MORE
[2:27:10] Clyde1500: So that's why he misses every arrow Kappa
[2:27:13] Respect_Dat1: what
[2:27:14] AzureCatalyst: OOO
[2:27:16] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: but he at least got an arrow
[2:27:17] MiIkMan: in this play targamas didnt talk once @MonteCristo
[2:27:17] hydranjea: 5head
[2:27:17] Respect_Dat1: in the fuck
[2:27:22] TastyAMG: That's literally what happened
[2:27:23] Grimoires_: BUT WHY IS SAKEN NOT ENGAGING
[2:27:23] TheMommik: @Vexzelofc Of course he is, but he is in the League TastyAMG was comparing Bo in, so it IS a fair comparison - bo's better hands are not enough in a shit team. Jankos' experience sometimes is
[2:27:36] hydranjea: LMFAO
[2:27:41] hydranjea: 4fun arrow
[2:27:43] QuackTheDuck: BO was backing so why is targamas going forward
[2:27:46] Syrmen: bo litteraly wants to go mid
[2:27:49] canyon_55: what a horrible play
[2:27:56] Syrmen: he pathes away, but targamas decided otherwise
[2:28:03] rioyter: this situation is in their voicecomms video btw
[2:28:06] Grimoires_: watch saken not engage from the pit
[2:28:07] MiIkMan: he didnt say a word
[2:28:09] hydranjea: comm: i hit arrow guys
[2:28:15] TastyAMG: @TheMommik Didn't bring up Jankos you did, the fact that Bo is even in the conversation with 8 less years of experience and 3 shit team mates should tell you how gapped LEC is
[2:28:16] wryjester: Bo just used e
[2:28:20] canyon_55: targa actually not even thinking what the plan or he is just bad
[2:28:22] deadpoool04: " i got a good arrow guys "
[2:28:23] Yuiieeee: That's a wintrading level of play LUL
[2:28:24] AzureCatalyst: GO IN SAKEN
[2:28:26] AzureCatalyst: GOOO IN
[2:28:28] AzureCatalyst: SAKKEN FUCKIGN GO IN
[2:28:28] Grimoires_: SAKEN GO IN\
[2:28:29] Zelgius: The sejuani ultimate is also beautiful
[2:28:29] Syrmen: why doesnt cabo dash into the pit
[2:28:30] Grimoires_: SDFKSDFSKFJDKF
[2:28:31] MiIkMan: @hydranjea no he said "no flash" after he died
[2:28:33] Vexzelofc: @TheMommik lol just because they both play in lec doesnt mean its a fair comparison at all
[2:28:35] dynamomarsh: I can't believe the polish got the first win trading allegations and not targarmas
[2:28:36] AzureCatalyst: sAKEN FAiled his q dash
[2:28:39] hydranjea: @MiIkMan LMFAO even better
[2:28:40] AzureCatalyst: Saken tried to dash q
[2:28:42] AzureCatalyst: And failed it
[2:28:53] Oraclon: yes!!
[2:28:54] TastyAMG: Yes
[2:28:54] hydranjea: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:28:55] AzureCatalyst: No
[2:28:57] AzureCatalyst: Nah
[2:28:59] wryjester: Nah Cabo is a part of the plan.

[2:28:59] shellgachi: very probable
[2:29:00] AzureCatalyst: Aint no way
[2:29:01] TastyAMG: you might even win the game off it
[2:29:02] MiIkMan: @hydranjea the coms are on their channel, he didnt say a word
[2:29:02] AzureCatalyst: Not possible
[2:29:04] Lucallia: that sounds silly
[2:29:05] Camer0n000: it would be suicide tbf
[2:29:08] MatteinhoTV: if you are good you do
[2:29:10] SingedLFT17: nah not worth
[2:29:10] AzureCatalyst: Wath him fail the q dash combo
[2:29:11] swerllwow: its a lose in peace angle
[2:29:24] AzureCatalyst: He failed the dash q combo
[2:29:25] Zelgius: Did he use Q? I didn't see
[2:29:28] AzureCatalyst: That was fucking hilarious
[2:29:28] Respect_Dat1: no because they'll find a way to mess it up :(
[2:29:37] TastyAMG: oh i forgot to mention that he's speaking a 2nd language too OMEGALUL
[2:29:38] KingTyonidas: or cabo can walk the other direction tlol
[2:29:38] hydranjea: @MiIkMan i figured lol just memeing, this game is ahrd to watch
[2:29:39] OvtForeverFall: he might have slid mid and has no cooldown
[2:29:42] AzureCatalyst: He wastes his first 2 soldiers in the choke
[2:29:45] sota_cat: check out saken item
[2:29:47] xonsa: cabo ults so late
[2:29:47] Zelgius: oh yeah he W-Qs instantly no?
[2:29:52] AzureCatalyst: He wastes 2 soldiers and he fails the w-q combo
[2:29:54] Prepo9: @montecristo He uses the dash to make it to toplane so it might be down
[2:29:55] iamconflux: Karmine Corps AINTNOWAY
[2:29:58] iamconflux: e
[2:29:58] weak_mental_renekton: Saken can position in the pit and hit over wall too
[2:30:07] AzureCatalyst: HAHA
[2:30:08] AzureCatalyst: That combo
[2:30:14] AzureCatalyst: Is Saken's career in a nutshell
[2:30:16] Oraclon: his best champion  btw...
[2:30:20] Respect_Dat1: and literally none of them have flash either
[2:30:23] headmomo: 4x time emea masters winner for a reason
[2:30:27] 0RE0N: Come on it's only Saken by far most played champion
[2:30:28] dowiet: this PSI disease is dangerous
[2:30:30] TheMommik: @TheMommik I seem to have had a massive brainfart and a misread. Not to mention, I agree with the sentiment anyways.
[2:30:33] headmomo: hardstuck
[2:30:35] Karego: Surely xin saw akali there
[2:30:41] mifot: it looks like saken uses e to come up from midlane
[2:30:50] Xenier13: He uses combo in mid
[2:30:52] Yuiieeee: He used E to get faster
[2:30:55] xonsa: mid is literally open
[2:31:12] kAtz124: did we review this game the other day or I'm wrong?
[2:31:25] QuackTheDuck: oh shit our support is feeding
[2:31:29] zkiin: LUL
[2:31:30] imshades: Is LEC plagued with the server lag causing warping like LCS? Kinda weird for that to be an issue period.
[2:31:31] AzureCatalyst: The Upset Comm Delay Hypothesis LUL
[2:31:35] hydranjea: 100 ping headset
[2:31:42] Riqui__: hes just getting those sweet minions
[2:31:49] TheFissk: EU brain lag on display
[2:31:51] killerwhalekj: na ping headset
[2:31:51] iamconflux: no shot no? isn't that pause worthy???????
[2:31:53] Camer0n000: gotta push in the wave first cant lose any gold
[2:32:04] dowiet: in a minute mom headset
[2:32:14] TastyAMG: but monte! its his best champion!
[2:32:20] TastyAMG: He's really good i swears
[2:32:24] kerokerogrips: chat does it feel like all regions are having game pauses due to game issues
[2:32:27] SingedLFT17: he has the highest DPM tho Kappa
[2:32:31] saberaxe: @MonteCristo he could also do the faker play soldier in pit, e, and q behind them
[2:32:37] AzureCatalyst: Wait
[2:32:39] AzureCatalyst: Do they engage
[2:32:44] fljqpy: ayy
[2:32:48] TastyAMG: he kinda has to no?
[2:32:49] hydranjea: bo checked out i feel that
[2:32:50] kAtz124: but at that fight should he had shove 5 ppl into xing 's face? i dont think so
[2:32:53] thelasts1lence: Those 3 are speaking on french accent of English so Upset has 5s delay for translation what they are saying Kappa
[2:32:57] Shobes572: It feels like he's playing for KDA and not pulling the trigger on plays where he might die
[2:32:59] AzureCatalyst: 1 FOR 1 to be honest
[2:33:01] AzureCatalyst: Not terrible
[2:33:01] weak_mental_renekton: KC still has gold lead?
[2:33:05] kerokerogrips: would pay to see the behind the scene documentary of this split
[2:33:09] QuackTheDuck: I mean Saken won't put a soilder there so someone has to
[2:33:22] d_kowalski: Bo never expected to find himself wishing to be back on Vitality of last year
[2:33:26] Respect_Dat1: how in the fuck does jax not have an item yet?
[2:33:27] LazyFuzai: Cabo movement here is sus
[2:33:38] AzureCatalyst: Man if only we pushed mid for the tower instead of engaging on apheliops earlier
[2:33:42] TastyAMG: @Respect_Dat1 its Cabochard in 2024
[2:33:43] fljqpy: even perkz cant help them
[2:33:46] TastyAMG: That's how
[2:33:59] Respect_Dat1: 20 minutes first item
[2:34:08] AzureCatalyst: Did we miss any Yamatocamms?
[2:34:09] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:34:29] t3lawrence: LOL
[2:34:31] 0RE0N: who is "they" giving the life? It's just Bo in first 3 games.
[2:34:31] AzureCatalyst: Joyful Yamato is my spirit animal
[2:34:33] TheMommik: First games didn't have Yamatocamms, they lean into it later
[2:34:33] Riqui__: they do in week 2
[2:34:37] AzureCatalyst: SAKENNNNNN
[2:34:38] iamconflux: last game they showed it and it's depressing AF
[2:34:40] AzureCatalyst: SAKENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
[2:34:40] fljqpy: ahh yes sej ult in face
[2:34:46] SingedLFT17: week 2 s way more depressing than weak 1
[2:35:00] imshades: @kerokerogrips LCS had server lag causing warping or minions/players day 1. Day 2 headset issues for the entire team + after show the players said the lag that was supposed to be "fixed" after day 1, was still present day 2
[2:35:00] QuackTheDuck: doesnt Saken have bashees?
[2:35:01] TastyAMG: The ult is bad isn't it?
[2:35:06] AzureCatalyst: uLTI IS NOT GREAT
[2:35:13] TastyAMG: it saves Supa no?
[2:35:15] AzureCatalyst: Ulti atually stops his team from following up
[2:35:28] AzureCatalyst: Like if he shuffles them towards his team at least xi ncan try to muirder one or two people
[2:35:36] Zelgius: KC loses that even if he doesn't ult
[2:35:41] mifot: it actually cancels xin's knockback
[2:35:45] hydranjea: 4fun arrow pt 2
[2:35:47] kerokerogrips: @imshades and LEC had pauses as well yea , is LCK having similar game pauses
[2:35:50] Prepo9: Again, he can just go in and get a 4man Azir ult from out of vision
[2:35:52] kAtz124: I think i saw monte reviewd this game the other day or i have 1 brain cell
[2:36:00] TastyAMG: Bo was going to knock them back into his team
[2:36:09] SingedLFT17: ye he saved neeko
[2:36:11] t3lawrence: @kAtz124 hes redoing kc
[2:36:15] 1DeepBlue: I'm just confused why MDK is allowed to have 6 players to KC's 4.
[2:36:19] TastyAMG: like how hard can you grief your all-star jungler
[2:36:27] saberaxe: @MonteCristo what was Cabo doing in that fight
[2:36:28] fljqpy: ayyyy
[2:36:29] hydranjea: i hope its tech issues lmfao
[2:36:29] weak_mental_renekton: there seem to be 5 consistent problem (makers)
[2:36:34] madiiiman: monte did u save ur bangers only t1 jdg from worlds? its gone from past broadcsts
[2:36:36] AzureCatalyst: Saken and Targamas are actually impressively bad
[2:36:39] QuackTheDuck: does that count as a yamato cam?
[2:36:39] Camer0n000: so far id say cabo and targ are just way too bad
[2:36:48] sota_cat: @1DeepBlue 8
[2:36:48] AzureCatalyst: Like I knew cabo was bad but seeing how poorly targamas and saken are
[2:36:49] saberaxe: @MonteCristo I mean the previous fight
[2:36:49] d_kowalski: Problem 1: being French
[2:36:53] TastyAMG: @Camer0n000 Saken as well
[2:36:54] imshades: @kerokerogrips I don't think preview is streamed anymore, I wonder if some of the deaths were due to warping
[2:36:55] AzureCatalyst: SAKEN FARMING WHILE UPSET Dies
[2:36:55] Respect_Dat1: the consistent problems are support diff
[2:36:56] Tameimpala2: it cant be the players, it must be the coach thats the problem surely!!!!!11!! Kappa
[2:36:56] verylingual: who stinks more Saken or Taeyoon
[2:37:00] saberaxe: @MonteCristo Akali came in on flank and we never see cabo really
[2:37:03] AzureCatalyst: Saken legit farming minions instead of killing akali
[2:37:05] imshades: *Pro-view
[2:37:08] SingedLFT17: azir flash is on cooldown but u dont see guys
[2:37:18] Karego: I, too, like to swing my  dick around in teamfights and hope for the best
[2:37:18] Zelgius: Cabo is right to walk away there
[2:37:25] AverageUgandan: Saken got hit with 2 ult damn NotLikeThis
[2:37:37] lawlaw0219: azir gets hit by two sej ults with flash ult
[2:37:41] lawlaw0219: *flash up
[2:37:44] ultimaterishi: casuallywalks into ashe xdd
[2:37:58] 3xperience_: Targomas walked into renata ult and kills saken
[2:37:59] AzureCatalyst: Upset is faring red
[2:38:05] AzureCatalyst: Upset farming red during that drake fight
[2:38:10] xonsa: vs 4 ap champs xin still no mercs
[2:38:20] AverageUgandan: I don't think saken used flash in this game NotLikeThis
[2:38:28] MiIkMan: gotta hold jax e if you want that fight
[2:38:33] beauds69: No ones on the same page on how the game should be progressed all doing random stuff
[2:38:38] Respect_Dat1: @AzureCatalyst NO SHOT OMEGALUL
[2:38:44] AzureCatalyst: HAHA
[2:38:50] JM_truevalor: Kc don't seem to be coherent or sync well I'm teamfights
[2:38:50] canyon_55: @AzureCatalyst lol
[2:38:53] kerokerogrips: monte if the riot laysoff were targetting areas that werent profitable how is the lcs still here
[2:38:54] AzureCatalyst: @Respect_Dat1 He fired his cait ulti then proceeded to farm the red buff
[2:39:03] 0RE0N: saken is for sure not shining light for kc lmao
[2:39:05] hydranjea: vegan chicken build lmfao
[2:39:09] TastyAMG: The 3 french players look like they are playing while on drugs and upset seems checked out FeelsBadMan

[2:39:10] Zelgius: Upset getting red is fine
[2:39:13] TastyAMG: Amazing question
[2:39:16] hydranjea: @kerokerogrips REAL
[2:39:17] iamconflux: are we reviewing all KC games chat
[2:39:18] AzureCatalyst: Oooo
[2:39:21] AzureCatalyst: Really ooooo
[2:39:23] AzureCatalyst: Hmmmm
[2:39:23] AverageUgandan: Yes
[2:39:24] AzureCatalyst: Weird
[2:39:29] hydranjea: what money? xd
[2:39:30] TheMommik: @iamconflux stream title
[2:39:31] verylingual: @iamconflux yes
[2:39:46] najafan: Which raises the question, why buy banshees? Verdant + working on another item is more efficient
[2:39:46] TastyAMG: @hydranjea Marketing? never heard of such a concept
[2:39:47] iamconflux: @iamconflux didn't say all games LUL
[2:39:47] vriesea97: 🤔 🤔
[2:39:48] AverageUgandan: Look at Dota it's insane LUL
[2:39:53] kerokerogrips: SHOCKING , but like for real how hard would it have been to have exclusive skins for buyers of riot forge games , kinda like how tf2 promo hats worked
[2:39:54] Syrmen: I want bo to succeed so bad, its making me depressed watching this
[2:39:56] Mr_pando: Who in this chat buys skins based off of riot esports?
[2:40:05] AzureCatalyst: Is that 2 for 8 for ashe arrows?
[2:40:14] kAtz124: any clue on what or who is the problem for KC so far?
[2:40:15] TastyAMG: @kerokerogrips Riot is not a logical company they are a cult
[2:40:16] najafan: @Mr_pando Is this chat representative of the people who watch LCS?
[2:40:17] Syrmen: Mr_pando it keeps the 14year old game alive, thus making ppl pay skins
[2:40:17] Clyde1500: is black cleaver normal on ashe?
[2:40:21] Tunatoogood: Faker made me want to buy an azir skin is all ill say
[2:40:24] AzureCatalyst: I bought DRX Akali because it looked dope but I had leftover RP from years ago
[2:40:31] MiIkMan: @Mr_pando people in general buy products they are exposed to
[2:40:35] hydranjea: tyler bass wishes he can hit field goals like targa arrrows @MonteCristo
[2:40:37] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips yea but they like money as well
[2:40:38] QuackTheDuck: Why dont they have Team skins then for Esports?
[2:40:45] Mr_pando: Don't think I've bought a skin in 10 years
[2:40:53] Zacokk: Just seems like the players KC came in with from LFL (mainly Targamas and Saken) are the problem
[2:40:53] fljqpy: yea but then they gotta pay the teams
[2:40:53] TastyAMG: @QuackTheDuck That requires paying the teams for their IP
[2:41:00] sota_cat: bo mechanics
[2:41:01] SingedLFT17: targams trying hard to be hyli
[2:41:03] najafan: @TastyAMG Correct!
[2:41:09] kerokerogrips: less artists now with the layoffs
[2:41:09] Sodo_Mojo: especially since you just fired a bunch of artists
[2:41:12] Respect_Dat1: TARGAMAS I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD
[2:41:18] AzureCatalyst: I can make skins where I get 100% of the profit or I can give the teams 50% of the profit hmmmm
[2:41:20] AverageUgandan: LUL
[2:41:21] AzureCatalyst: What should I do?
[2:41:23] 0RE0N: @MonteCristo you can make normal skins and make chromas for each team?
[2:41:38] I0wdusk: hmm... Kappa
[2:41:41] AzureCatalyst: LOL
[2:41:43] AverageUgandan: Makes sense
[2:41:43] AzureCatalyst: That blastcone
[2:41:43] fljqpy: why u need the teams for that
[2:41:45] LordAnomandaris: Unless you are Faker and don't use skins at all lol
[2:41:47] Karego: all the money pls
[2:41:48] TastyAMG: Same problem
[2:41:49] AzureCatalyst: That blast cone is hilarious
[2:41:51] najafan: And the teams will encourage their players to play with the team skins rather than normal skins.
[2:41:56] Imaslapyou: Does the esports team have dirt on Marc Merril, that's the 3rd option
[2:41:56] I0wdusk: when you put it like this...  LUL
[2:41:58] najafan: For obvious reasons.
[2:42:11] AverageUgandan: Riot doesn't want team to make money guys LUL
[2:42:13] Camer0n000: i bought the t1 emote and icon i hope they make an ig one
[2:42:15] 0RE0N: it's aram ashe
[2:42:17] TastyAMG: ooo ooo i know monte
[2:42:18] Mr_pando: Then why argue?  Just stop competing in the riot system
[2:42:19] SingedLFT17: cant ashe reveal akali with her E
[2:42:19] AzureCatalyst: Two autos
[2:42:21] AverageUgandan: teams*
[2:42:24] Lucallia: obviously it's because he's ashe support not adc /s
[2:42:24] fljqpy: auto who
[2:42:24] TheMommik: It's ARAM Ashe
[2:42:25] AzureCatalyst: He got two autos and das it
[2:42:26] hydranjea: why would he auto hes only playing HOB ashe
[2:42:28] TastyAMG: is it because he's shit? saoriNotes
[2:42:30] Zelgius: Maybe he right clicks to auto
[2:42:41] AzureCatalyst: Oh god
[2:42:47] irrelevant_ow: I feel bad for yamato
[2:42:48] Oraclon: feels like KC is not used to  play with an ADC on  their team, they never hive him space to play
[2:42:51] AzureCatalyst: Lets watch if targamas lands an ulti
[2:42:55] hydranjea: targamas flank pogggggg
[2:42:58] fljqpy: hes baiting bro
[2:42:59] QuackTheDuck: Why not contract the teams to have their own inhouse artist to make the skins then?
[2:43:02] AzureCatalyst: He backed later?
[2:43:06] shellgachi: he was dead
[2:43:08] Karego: he died botlane
[2:43:09] TheMommik: He died
[2:43:09] AzureCatalyst: Looks like he was at inhib when everyone else was at baron
[2:43:18] Karego: lol
[2:43:23] TastyAMG: @QuackTheDuck Still less than 100% of the money
[2:43:27] TheMommik: he died harassing backs
[2:43:28] fljqpy: hes baiting
[2:43:30] TastyAMG: you have to pay people for their IP
[2:43:33] AzureCatalyst: He plopped the ward over
[2:43:35] Duje275: but why is he w'ing
[2:43:35] najafan: @QuackTheDuck Same issue, in that teams will still have their players advertise their skins rather than the ones they make 100% of the money off of.
[2:43:41] AzureCatalyst: Once he plops the ward over they see him
[2:43:48] najafan: It's just worse for them in every situation.
[2:43:49] hydranjea: W a sejuani pogggg
[2:43:57] AzureCatalyst: WOOO
[2:43:59] Zacokk: They saw someone place the ward
[2:44:02] Camer0n000: gotta slow down the sej
[2:44:04] TastyAMG: @najafan Not really but that's how Riot sees it
[2:44:12] Zelgius: They have no idea where Akali is anyway
[2:44:12] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/

[2:45:04] Camer0n000: why does jax have maw
[2:45:05] kAtz124: is saken's flsah bug? it seemed not being use for the entire game
[2:45:06] najafan: KC did, rather than the ward.
[2:45:07] AzureCatalyst: Dat ashe was missingggg
[2:45:18] najafan: No need to ward, is what they're saying.
[2:45:33] najafan: But Targ did it anyhow
[2:45:34] MiIkMan: kc had vision, he didnt need to place the ward
[2:45:35] Respect_Dat1: ashe was late because they face-checked a bush and died
[2:45:35] hydranjea: sigh
[2:45:35] Mr_pando: Does tencent make money in dollars and euros or in yuan ?
[2:45:40] TastyAMG: @Mr_pando yes
[2:45:42] TheBiscuitNZ: everyone is just attacking diffrent targets imo
[2:45:44] AzureCatalyst: I think to be honest if he tanks the Sejuani ulti and they full commit on Targamas his team actually takes the baron while Elyoya is commiting onto the ashe
[2:45:53] swerllwow: it looks like solo q lol
[2:46:04] hydranjea: plat soloq
[2:46:05] swerllwow: like they are just typing at eachother
[2:46:11] Camer0n000: they got 200 yeard
[2:46:17] AverageUgandan: Let's hear the voice comms pls PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:46:18] najafan: They meant that KC already had vision from minions, so Targ didn't need to ward @MonteCristo
[2:46:21] fljqpy: cmon dude that isnt important
[2:46:21] ctrain46: lol
[2:46:22] clmft1: I feel so bad for BO
[2:46:29] ctrain46: that guy in the crowd
[2:46:29] Violet_Katt: taht dude took his shirt off KEKW
[2:46:29] Grimoires_: You're talking like Targamas' presence makes a positive impact for KC in the first place
[2:46:31] TheMommik: @MonteCristo Ashe was late because he was delaying backs after the bot play and got caught and died
[2:46:37] kerokerogrips: whats the Chinese version of ahhh shibal
[2:46:37] AzureCatalyst: OH YEHA
[2:46:40] AzureCatalyst: ASHE IS LATE CUZ HE DIED
[2:46:43] riley_bruce_: @fljqpy are u just here to disagree lol
[2:46:45] AzureCatalyst: AFTER THAT BOT PLAY BECAUSE HE WARDS THE BUSH
[2:46:54] AzureCatalyst: THAT'S WHY ASHE IS LATE

[2:47:43] TastyAMG: This guy is legit playing without a brain
[2:47:43] Grimoires_: Why are you talking like Targamas' presence is a positive thing for KC? @MonteCristo
[2:47:44] limemarten: Targamas: 1 LEC title. Rest of team: 0 LEC title :)
[2:47:44] AzureCatalyst: Every subsequent rewatch this paly is worseeeeeee
[2:47:44] Lucallia: "I found them :D" -Targamas
[2:47:44] Clyde1500: @Paroto7 yeah but he's french

[2:47:45] 0SilverMp0: are we going watch all 6 games or 3 today and 3 tomorrow
[2:47:52] Lamynator: could've arrow volley'd to safely check if you absolutely needed to check
[2:47:56] sota_cat: kc making engage call then bo goes in dead，kc engage no reason bo follows up then they sell him ，he died again
[2:47:56] kerokerogrips: Dr Monte im finding a common symptom in each of these KC games , do you have a diagnosis
[2:47:56] laurik: targamas playing so bad LUL
[2:48:00] MiIkMan: he dies 2 times in 1 min from warding

[2:51:40] clippityycloppityy: bo literally like wait where’s azir
[2:51:44] I0wdusk: too many cooks in the kitchen
[2:51:45] AzureCatalyst: Azir is literally warding Bot river when he says he can fight
[2:51:48] MissingMatter: He "CAN" fight, but he's not going to go over there rand do it.
[2:51:50] AzureCatalyst: AZIR IS LITERALLY MOVING AWAY FROM THE FIGHT
[2:51:50] Zacokk: And Targamas is saying .....
[2:51:54] 1DeepBlue: I'm guessing Targames moved forward to set a ward for Azir. Which promptly got turned off
[2:51:55] Tameimpala2: did targamas see akali go into bush??
[2:51:58] BigMightyena: Saken LUL
[2:51:59] TastyAMG: This saken guy is so stupid LuL

[2:52:05] rewqfadr: i have better comms and i am plat xD
[2:52:08] AzureCatalyst: Azir was literally warding the bot side river brush
[2:52:10] Lucallia: Did they have to clarify "Can't you be top NOW?"
[2:52:13] AzureCatalyst: As he says we can fight
[2:52:20] 4blaze2that0: guys I'm 300 gold away from my dagger don't fight
[2:52:21] 1DeepBlue: Cabos' TP makes a lot more sense if we assume Azir is also supposed to be coming
[2:52:21] AzureCatalyst: Saken is literally giving false info

[2:53:05] TheMommik: UPSET WALKS BACK!
[2:53:07] 4blaze2that0: nah but targamas being a literal mute support is pretty mental LUL
[2:53:17] AzureCatalyst: If targamas says anything about the engage
[2:53:29] najafan: 20 seconds
[2:53:30] TastyAMG: Targamas being mute is equally as big of a problem
[2:53:31] Zacokk: LUL man
[2:53:32] Lucallia: cait starts closer tot he fight and arrives later than azir....
[2:53:33] najafan: 20 seconds to get there
[2:53:34] MiIkMan: yeah

[2:53:54] bambeeno94: Clip that shit.
[2:54:01] sota_cat: bo didnt，bo says back
[2:54:04] Zacokk: So he kinda trusted the comms
[2:54:07] saberaxe: Bo recognised it was stupid for a bit and says Ok back before commiting again
[2:54:07] fljqpy: upset wants the wave
[2:54:09] MiIkMan: should be 12 sec
[2:54:12] iamconflux: Faker of ERL KEKL
[2:54:12] QuackTheDuck: Upset is like oh shit I see creeps I go to wave
[2:54:15] Syrmen: he sais "you can fight?" while being so far it makes no sense
[2:54:17] 4blaze2that0: upset needs more sustenance

[2:54:22] Zelgius: Upset is going for the 100% play of denying them a wave
[2:54:22] AzureCatalyst: I remember Ogre2 saying that the only thing worse than no comms is false comms.
[2:54:29] AzureCatalyst: Legit Saken is trolling his team with his comms
[2:54:33] fljqpy: fake news in comms
[2:54:34] Lucallia: adc might be a bot that's programmed only to farm
[2:54:35] 1DeepBlue: 17 seconds is an entire rotation of abilities for some champs...

[2:55:10] AzureCatalyst: @Respect_Dat1 Even though he gets zoned by neeko he can dash behind the team and go for a 5 man shuffle so his team can actually fight
[2:55:14] AverageUgandan: things*
[2:55:15] kAtz124: maybe Upset looked the fight was over or not going to break up another fight so he walk mid?

[2:57:09] wigge123: Why is Bo 90% of there Coms?
[2:57:09] vedana9: disgusting in all aspects
[2:57:12] Syrmen: @Toaster321 bo is making calls that nobody follows for some reason
[2:57:16] 4blaze2that0: @Lucallia if you're gonna do that send him to a sports psychologist first, he's a tilter
[2:57:16] TastyAMG: @Toaster321 You want someone who will listen to Bo not make comms even worse
[2:57:19] canyon_55: upset is kinda bad ngl
[2:57:20] kerokerogrips: probably used to lpl adc's where they will absolutely carry the team fight
[2:57:24] AzureCatalyst: calls for finish and upset decides to channel ulti
[2:57:27] innaething: @MiIkMan He is not clear about fighting, he talks for himself not the group. Unnacceptable
[2:57:27] fljqpy: says finish then go out

[2:57:48] TastyAMG: @Respect_Dat1 He said literally nothing
[2:57:49] 0RE0N: team just doesn't listen
[2:57:50] 1DeepBlue: I can see now why Targames doesn't say a lot.
[2:57:51] tmihee: bo is the only one talking abt sums timer in all these coms

[2:58:16] AzureCatalyst: Not this one
[2:58:17] michaelsmumma: thats crazy that bo is most of the comms
[2:58:19] dowiet: the answer to the autopsy is brain worms
[2:58:20] aoersie: They need a support that can talk more
[2:58:21] killerwhalekj: how do they understand each other’s accent
[2:58:22] fljqpy: fucking noise pollution in comms
[2:58:25] iamconflux: You can count Targamas entire comms in BOTH HANDS
[2:58:26] AzureCatalyst: THIS GAME is fucking misery
[2:58:35] clippityycloppityy: this one hurts the insides
[2:58:37] SingedLFT17: caitlyn ban vs KC
[2:58:43] AvariceTrades: do you think this team is fixable without player substitutions?

[2:58:50] Grimoires_: this is the only time Yamato draft didn't cook
[2:58:52] vedana9: upset is a mute, he says like 1 or 2 words max, and targamas just doesnt speak.
[2:58:53] Grimoires_: and it showed
[2:58:54] clippityycloppityy: 3 ad bans
[2:58:57] AzureCatalyst: upset gets 3 bans and the team can't get anything in first 3 in terms of power picks NotLikeThis
[2:59:06] AzureCatalyst: WE LOCK IN SION WHEN THEY HAVE 3 ADC BANS
[2:59:06] sota_cat: you know what if its 4 lec koreans and bo  same team they can communicate better in ENG，cuz commons really just need “gogogo backbackback mememe adadad wavwavwav baron first and waitwaitwait and pins， nothing else ”

[3:00:53] iamconflux: we all did
[3:00:53] 0RE0N: Saken trolls build for no reason this game
[3:00:58] JakeJr: Is Yamto actually a good coach?

[3:01:16] TastyAMG: "You can pick any player you want"
[3:01:16] xonsa: this is a dumpster truck
[3:01:18] AzureCatalyst: He begged and courted the KC fanbase for a year
[3:01:20] PaddiV: well.. yamato can probably stream next week xD
[3:01:21] TastyAMG: "just not top mid and support"
[3:01:29] JakeJr: What does a coach 'do' in League?
[3:01:29] AzureCatalyst: He's getting all 16 wheels of this bus going over him
[3:01:29] iamconflux: LMFAO
[3:01:30] beauds69: Does KC having no IGL or unity not fall on coach though?
[3:01:32] 0RE0N: @MonteCristo before seeing the game what do you think corki should build vs HRT draft?
[3:01:33] canyon_55: true OMEGALUL
[3:01:35] josefino10: and Heretics usually plays very slow game and it was terrible suffering for kc this is painful
[3:01:36] fljqpy: sadly the BOus hit him hard
[3:01:41] sota_cat: they have 3 lane prior and lvl 2 invade j4. what bo can do
[3:01:43] scully645: Monte, I recently inherited millions of dollars. How much to get you to coach a League Team again?
[3:01:53] AzureCatalyst: Oh god
[3:01:53] canyon_55: his drafts are fking insane
[3:01:54] fksep: Whats the point of having Targamas on the team when he plays like shit individually and says nothing the entire game?
[3:01:55] QuackTheDuck: can we get different bus drivers
[3:02:04] xonsa: maligma
[3:02:04] Tunatoogood: Malignance Tear probably

[3:02:32] 0RE0N: surely it's not triforce right :tf:
[3:02:33] AzureCatalyst: Surely he can land more than 2 rockets during a standoff
[3:02:40] Mr_pando: I bet in Yamato contract is s bonus for coaching Cabo in the v team
[3:02:41] AzureCatalyst: Surely he won't miss every rocket for 30 minutes straight
[3:02:42] iamconflux: Palafox' Corki looked good
[3:02:46] AverageUgandan: I remember thats hybrid corki build WutFace WutFace WutFace
[3:03:15] Respect_Dat1: idk why people sleep on lichbane 3rd item instead of malignance

[3:03:25] Tunatoogood: Poke comp relying on corki only
[3:03:32] AzureCatalyst: Corki's Package is not an option when Saken is the player piloting it
[3:03:40] KingTyonidas: surely kc makes changes and doesnt double down on this lineup next split
[3:03:45] fljqpy: yea KC has good setup for objectives Kappa
[3:03:45] TastyAMG: Monte calling Saken a pric D:

[3:11:18] Youistheniqq: they gotta have a new passive for draven its too dumb  very ahead if kills or else useless if die

[3:12:24] najafan: ngl, I feel so old when people don't understand what "zaddy" means.
[3:12:25] TastyAMG: it would be fine if they didn't get the kill on draven
[3:12:27] MissingMatter: Well, he can't possibly expect an Azir to slide through terrain and ult. He's been playing with Saken.

[3:15:02] GuinsooArc: tri force? I don’t think he’ll be able to out dps azir or draven so it’s pretty useless no?
[3:15:05] fksep: upset based as they're starting dragon?

[3:16:12] clippityycloppityy: upset quiet quitting is the most accurate call I’ve ever heard
[3:16:17] Lucallia: The comms probably went "Give me top wave" -Upset
[3:16:17] Camer0n000: they need a new adc so badly upset is too passive
[3:16:26] kerokerogrips: UPSET KDA IN DANGER RETREAT RETREAT RETREAT
[3:16:47] sota_cat: besides bo ，noone really wants to win
[3:16:49] Jay4our: Kabcochard did a good recall, Upset did a bad recall
[3:16:59] Respect_Dat1: aphelios even has good guns for the dragon fight
[3:17:28] 0RE0N: bo had time to walk to dragon at the same time as jankos/flakked
[3:17:31] 0RE0N: *cabo
[3:17:32] QuackTheDuck: upset is like I need dagger
[3:17:38] 4blaze2that0: guys we can't fight this I have white green I need red purple to fight
[3:17:44] Prepo9: Upset is just wintrading vs Perkz
[3:17:47] epicalbawler: Upset is a fraud
[3:17:53] lazink: upset is getting red
[3:17:56] KorlackJ: where the hell is he going
[3:17:58] KorlackJ: what in the world
[3:17:59] Tunatoogood: Show up do nothing

[3:18:01] moonweaverr: red wasnt even there @lazink
[3:18:03] lazink: or going top
[3:18:03] Jay4our: Jesus
[3:18:05] najafan: Legit reportable
[3:18:10] spucky117: and package on the wave
[3:18:11] 4blaze2that0: he's gonna have red purple soon they can fight then
[3:18:11] scully645: Seems like an Upset problem
[3:18:12] spucky117: for a plate
[3:18:13] Mizzzraim: he's aphelios he needs to scale Kappa
[3:18:13] TlMBERS: i dont think kc can 5v5 there though ?
[3:18:33] Lucallia: Cabo leaves top which means the top minions are unattended and Upset can't leave minions unattended
[3:18:42] AzureCatalyst: There;s the package onto the tower
[3:18:44] scully645: "They're going to fuck us" -Upset, every game.
[3:18:44] Camer0n000: the worst part is people still call upset a top adc and he does this all the time
[3:18:47] Karego: then leave sion pushing top to begi nwith?
[3:18:51] fljqpy: just leash the drake for them LUL
[3:18:55] AverageUgandan: No one is in the same page LUL
[3:18:56] lazink: to be fair, has KC ever 5v5? usually upset is doing his own thing
[3:18:57] MissingMatter: Why are they all there, then? Give up dragon and push two lanes.
[3:19:08] sota_cat: first tp gap why sion notpushing top，2nd why upset doesnt wanna win
[3:19:13] MissingMatter: If they don't think they can fight, then don't form up for a fight.
[3:19:13] scully645: Upset said it: "They're going to fuck us"\
[3:19:18] Camer0n000: they should just pick upset sivir every game and let him just clear cs until they lose in 30 mins
[3:19:32] Lamynator: it'd be better to have them decisively make a bad play cause at least that can get coached.  This indecision and lack of communication is extremely difficult to coach
[3:19:34] Karego: upset playing to slowly lose
[3:19:37] najafan: It's Bo v the world.
[3:19:37] fljqpy: 10th place gameplay
[3:19:41] clippityycloppityy: saken could also zone w package to flip drake if they want

[3:19:47] Pings1: upset is trash kda player
[3:19:48] fljqpy: not even perkz can save
[3:19:48] t3hf4ult: His team is fighting and hes walking top
[3:19:50] marlyswabbie: maybe they are tilted and did /deafen
[3:19:58] scully645: Bo vs Upset - how to play the game difference
[3:20:09] scully645: You could see it in comms
[3:20:10] clippityycloppityy: how is corki not zoning with package
[3:20:12] 4blaze2that0: the one time he has good guns for a teamfight he leaves LUL
[3:20:14] kcgoodguy: too much pressure imo
[3:20:23] xonsa: sion has a great spot to ult in too
[3:20:34] fljqpy: upset must know that caliste is coming and hes getting the boot
[3:20:39] Zebrios: I think Upset is entirely overrated as an ADC because he had one good year
[3:20:41] 0RE0N: "saken with package is big"
[3:20:43] Camer0n000: I think bo only uses r once this game
[3:20:45] TastyAMG: This is so easy if Targamas didn't give 1k gold to draven FeelsBadMan
[3:20:59] TastyAMG: and upset didn't take a plane to top lane
[3:21:02] scully645: "They're going to fuck us" - Upset
[3:21:14] Shobes572: Can we get a counter for the rockets Saken hits?
[3:21:23] Karego: take a shot
[3:21:34] GuinsooArc: I think fighting that would be a disaster for them since Draven and Azir have an item up
[3:21:42] Camer0n000: they have a strong late game in theory with an aphelios and corki but than you remember it’s upset and saken
[3:22:04] 0RE0N: KC are very clearly playing defensive poke comp and Saken building trinity first FailFish
[3:22:14] TastyAMG: @Camer0n000 with his team playing like this Bo didn't really get to play the game at all
[3:22:39] KorlackJ: corki is a strong 1 and 2 item power spike with eclipse, this build is very bad
[3:22:58] scully645: do they think they scale or what
[3:23:05] Camer0n000: yeah bo does nothing wrong this game he had an afk adc this game so it was unsinkable
[3:23:06] spucky117: where is targamas
[3:23:18] TastyAMG: @scully645 They should scale but Corki is troll building
[3:23:26] spucky117: watch targs pathing here

[3:23:44] Haziri_: Watch what targamas does also
[3:23:51] I0wdusk: aka, no Wins, no comms and in pieces
[3:23:57] TastyAMG: Draven didn't get the kill at least
[3:23:59] Prepo9: This just feels like a tilt play

[3:24:58] Respect_Dat1: ok so for targamas on that one maybe he was preparing for shelly take but then bo got caught out

[3:26:07] marlyswabbie: KC look like they given up entirely, only showing up cause its their job
[3:26:09] GuinsooArc: SAKEN is not confident.. I feel like he has the play in his head but doesn’t wanna pull the trigger

[3:29:24] AzureCatalyst: Surely our corki can use package for some damage
[3:29:29] 0RE0N: @MonteCristo to be fair when milio was on Bo's team he didn't cleanse any CC so Bo might've been confused here

[3:29:53] Tameimpala2: nah TH just got lucky with the milio pick. they didntplan this out Kappa
[3:29:58] AzureCatalyst: @Lucallia Nah Saken likes to use his package on towers as a statement against the LCS
[3:29:58] Camer0n000: so Kcorp probably thought they could do the same
[3:30:01] goteborgssnus: KC > T1 prove me wrong

[3:30:20] dettming: yamatocannon is a fraud. I dont get how that guy still coach.
[3:30:24] Babkis: KC is fantastic, they just need to work on communication, map awareness, laning, vision control, csing, poking, landing skillshots, objective control, early game, mid game, late game, ganking, and getting kills.
[3:30:33] AzureCatalyst: Suyrely this tp
[3:30:37] AzureCatalyst: Surely this sion will do something

[3:31:13] nickis211: Yamato has given them some GOD drafts. That rumble one was a kingdom
[3:31:16] Camer0n000: this was a great draft sion front line 3 carry’s and an enchanter

[3:31:24] AverageUgandan: All KC needs now iwdPepega
[3:31:24] Lucallia: You can't coach rats to fly...
[3:31:24] scully645: Who is playing the game right? Bo or Upset? Obvious disconnect
[3:31:24] goteborgssnus: Do coaches tell them waht to build, or is it the players that chose it?
[3:31:25] eck1e: objectively, he has put KC in winning situations from draft more than once, not his fault that his players shit themselves
[3:31:31] MissingMatter: He may have to have a discussion with them about communication, because they're clearly not on board with that.
[3:31:37] najafan: No complicated supports ever
[3:31:50] direpants2: has targamas' mouth ever moved while the cam was on him?
[3:31:54] AverageUgandan: Definitely a player diff yeah
[3:31:56] spucky117: and zero point and click engage
[3:32:01] 4blaze2that0: targamas is just perma mewing
[3:32:06] ohsomagical_: its funny because the french fans were so excited, but their team is dogpiss lol
[3:32:07] TastyAMG: Would the NFL Dade award be the 2007 New England Patriots award? rlewisEmojiThink
[3:32:08] marlyswabbie: Maybe Yamato is just trying to change things up in draft in hope that they can get a win, not much he can do
[3:32:09] Lamynator: @goteborgssnus players would choose, but in theory they've practiced and come up with a strategy on comps they pick
[3:32:10] spucky117: do they even talk?? or just pings?
[3:32:12] sota_cat: @Babkis also diving n team fight combo，5 men spacing
[3:32:26] tmihee: @direpants2 never, bro prema muted
[3:32:26] AzureCatalyst: The only poke we have is Lilia Swirlseed Aware
[3:32:27] fingerwagged: funny how everyone wanna blame everyone exept upset, as per usual
[3:32:30] dettming: @tmihee @MonteCristo Isn't it the coach's job to go through series of events with players? These guys don't seem to know what to do.
[3:32:32] Camer0n000: kcorp should watch what Kaiser does with th cause targamas is playing exactly the same way that Kaiser did with bo and upset on vitality
[3:32:47] TastyAMG: @fingerwagged He flamed upset for the dragon fight tho?
[3:32:54] scully645: @wigge123 Despite regular season success, he can do nothing in the postseason when it matters
[3:32:54] Zebrios: HIMARS disagrees.
[3:32:54] ohsomagical_: the french fans are legit dogPISS mane
[3:32:54] Lucallia: @fingerwagged did you just get here? Upset was getting non-stop flamed earlier
[3:32:59] najafan: @fingerwagged I've no love for upset, but dear lord are Cabo and Targ worse.
[3:33:11] kcgoodguy: the sad part of Kcorp split its they are pretty good in scrims
[3:33:17] scully645: Who's the problem on this team?
[3:33:25] MissingMatter: Of course he can't. He's not named after a protoss ability.
[3:33:25] najafan: @scully645 Everyone but Bo
[3:33:27] Sodo_Mojo: scrimbux chatter
[3:33:28] Camer0n000: cabo and targ
[3:33:31] fljqpy: everyone
[3:33:31] kerokerogrips: yamato can give this gods gift of draft but its the players who are piloting the champs
[3:33:42] naocorrijo: @kcgoodguy i dont think so, in lasts euphoria they say theyre bad in scrims
[3:33:45] Komarimasita: this team is just crashing and burning
[3:33:47] AverageUgandan: Dom said the same thing iwdPepega
[3:33:48] yoyom987: Do you think letting the coach communicate with the team during the game (like american football) would be a good addition?
[3:33:54] pleblurker9: Team effort :)
[3:33:55] deadpoool04: that draft against Vitality was so goood and they still managed to lose that game LUL
[3:34:04] kAtz124: time to implement tatical pause LUL
[3:34:04] Nytrodark: so what youre saying monte in short that yamato is a zoo keepers for these monkeys LUL
[3:34:08] Lucallia: How can you possibly blame Yamato when bot lane lost the push advantage while running Cait, Ashe?!
[3:34:12] spucky117: i agree with you and thorin... from SI... bo getting tilted and upset quiet quitting while saaken has performance anxiety
[3:34:14] kcgoodguy: @naocorrijo caps mikyx and perkz Said it
[3:34:14] kerokerogrips: i never watched starcraft 2 who was idra ?
[3:34:18] Clyde1500: I am not an RTS guy FeelsBadMan
[3:34:20] scully645: Back in my day, we didn't HAVE banelings
[3:34:20] TastyAMG: What's a terrin? rlewisZoomer
[3:34:21] ohsomagical_: EULCS play by play casters are so bad lol
[3:34:29] Nekor_: Idra was "Special"
[3:34:32] Nekor_: HEH
[3:34:33] GuinsooArc: Jankos keep forcing Bo to burn flash so he can’t use it on his team. True jungle veteran right there
[3:34:35] Lamynator: @kerokerogrips super famous rager, probably the most famous NA players of his time.
[3:34:35] 4blaze2that0: the only thing I can blame yamato for is giving upset aphelios, I don't think I've seen him play a good game of it yet
[3:34:39] eck1e: I do wonder if KC have the balls to make changes going into spring, or if they are going to run it back
[3:34:47] naocorrijo: @kcgoodguy that they're good? weird... i mean they weren't doing good even as a full team in inhouses
[3:34:54] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips is that why i saw a bunch of 4chan /v/ threads about him

[3:35:10] Zebrios: Corki isn't a threat - they can just walk right past him.
[3:35:14] Violet_Katt: Lilia into Millio is suffering

[3:35:36] QuackTheDuck: dude Lilia is so hard to play into Millio
[3:35:42] Camer0n000: no wonder I thought lillia never hit a single ult it got millio r’d every time
[3:35:55] scully645: "They're going to fuck us" - Upset
[3:36:04] Lucallia: it's pretty much the only thing milio has to watch out for to R too
[3:36:07] Sodo_Mojo: what is that package
[3:36:07] xonsa: they just lost their poke position advantage
[3:36:09] bigbraingame: upset got fucked

[3:37:09] limemarten: 202X champ vs 200X champ
[3:37:12] deadpoool04: you missed yamato cam
[3:37:14] ladderoat: Saken had package there lmao
[3:37:14] naocorrijo: @kcgoodguy bo online warrior, i'd say
[3:37:18] Demokritos: urgot can do the same thing if you buffer it before the cc
[3:37:20] Tameimpala2: wait besides Lilia ult, Milio doesnt really need to use ult for other spells besides poly on draven LUL
[3:37:20] AzureCatalyst: That saken package
[3:37:20] scully645: Fucked
[3:37:21] Sodo_Mojo: he can't even package 2 tanks
[3:37:26] fljqpy: baron fucked him up
[3:37:35] fingerwagged: sorry guys, yeah I just entered recently, I had forgotten monte could be objective. I'd just assume we'd give upset a perma pass after consuming dom and thorin content for years
[3:37:36] MissingMatter: But he also got a ward.
[3:37:39] AzureCatalyst: Cabo's reanimated corpse
[3:37:42] AverageUgandan: Yamato NotLikeThis
[3:37:44] AzureCatalyst: 0-1-0 Cabo Aware
[3:37:47] deadpoool04: YamatoCam TrollDespair

[3:38:28] fljqpy: ayyyyy
[3:38:29] najafan: @fingerwagged My guy, we were hard flaming Upset like 30 minutes ago on the second game
[3:38:33] AzureCatalyst: jesus christ

[3:38:48] Nytrodark: targamas is gone next split
[3:38:48] najafan: Er, 3rd game
[3:38:51] Camer0n000: how did Saken have a bounty
[3:38:52] makhaonx: Draven best pick againts kc
[3:39:05] Nytrodark: trymbi is free i hope kc picks him
[3:39:10] AzureCatalyst: @Camer0n000 He got a kill on jankos and that kill on perks
[3:39:14] Play_Time7: I have to say tho, this KC fiasco has brought me a lot of laughs with some of the edits ive seen
[3:39:15] QuackTheDuck: Upset guns make me sick Purple White
[3:39:47] fatalqwerty: mfw you got smited like a stupid krug FeelsBadMan
[3:39:49] Demokritos: is trinity corki even that good on this patch, ap items seem way better. It's been awhile since I touched corki
[3:39:52] fljqpy: squashed
[3:39:52] najafan: Wait. Oh my god.

[3:39:58] najafan: Cabo built correctly!
[3:40:03] Play_Time7: the millio fucks them
[3:40:04] najafan: I'm shocked!
[3:40:05] fatalqwerty: What's so bad about their team comp Monte?
[3:40:06] pleblurker9: Bo is so fcking tilted xD
[3:40:10] najafan: Good for Cabo!
[3:40:10] xonsa: corki going lethality item vs 2 tanks
[3:40:13] Karego: Especially with the comm issues
[3:40:13] GuinsooArc: SAKEN build is so bad
[3:40:14] TastyAMG: Yeah this does seem like it was lost in draft and at first blood
[3:40:21] Camer0n000: if it was maokai instead of lillia it’s pretty good imo
[3:40:22] najafan: I'm so happy.
[3:40:25] najafan: Guys.
[3:40:26] Camer0n000: it just doesn’t have engage
[3:40:32] TastyAMG: Starting the game 1k gold down is for sure tilting
[3:40:33] Lucallia: @najafan It was his turn with the brain cell that he sahres with Saken. That's why Skaen's build looks like that.
[3:40:33] najafan: Cabo built properly here!!
[3:40:37] Grimoires_: eclipse doesn't give lethality
[3:40:38] hotblew1337: EClipse isnt lethality anymore btw @MonteCristo
[3:40:39] Grimoires_: it's 70 ad
[3:40:47] fatalqwerty: malignance corki would melt here ngl
[3:40:49] hotblew1337: eclipse is 70 ad 15 AH
[3:40:51] spucky117: i think... it was yamato giving in to his players
[3:40:58] GodlyFabio: I'll be honest, IDK what KCorp are doing, but I guess it's "Rookie Syndrome"
[3:41:01] scully645: @MonteCristo if eSports winter kills you, do NOT go to law school. Being a lawyer sucks
[3:41:01] spucky117: he won draft for them last game
[3:41:08] GuinsooArc: Corki will never outdps Azir soldiers or Draven ever
[3:41:17] spucky117: he gave them "comfort"
[3:41:20] DynkLive: corki has hardly autoed anything this game
[3:41:24] Tameimpala2: Bo on tank jungelers tho 💀
[3:41:27] TastyAMG: @spucky117 That would explain a lot
[3:41:28] Grimoires_: if every winning draft doesn't work, might as well run it down with the players in solidarity -YamatoCannon 2024
[3:41:34] AzureCatalyst: @GuinsooArc If only he built something which allowed him to outrange them and dps them from a distance
[3:41:38] GodlyFabio: pretty sure they wanted to just neutro azir in lane, and pray to the gods that Upset snowballs
[3:41:43] hotblew1337: @GuinsooArc Corki isnt meant to out DPS them hes meant to get them so low w poke that they cant even fight
[3:42:00] nighkey: wunder is never going to die
[3:42:09] Camer0n000: upset use blue ult plsw
[3:42:09] GuinsooArc: That’s what I mean with his build.. He can never auto against Azir or Draven
[3:42:16] TastyAMG: @GodlyFabio Their rookies just suck and Targamas is committing crimes in every game
[3:42:16] Anelit21: "AUTOPSY" omg AHAHAHHA LUL LUL LUL  <3
[3:42:21] scully645: YamatoSadge.emote
[3:42:29] kookoolau: top and jungle are wrong picks on red side
[3:42:29] AzureCatalyst: As I said earlier. This game is misery
[3:42:39] najafan: Targ needs to be on perma Janna/Raka duty, I swear.
[3:42:42] SgtMurasa: oh the misery
[3:42:42] fljqpy: rookies in KC LUL
[3:42:51] cannabis420: what a disugsting act from karmine corpse
[3:42:52] najafan: No complicated champs
[3:42:54] kerokerogrips: when is immortals  getting an autopsy
[3:42:56] najafan: No room to mess up
[3:43:02] nighkey: like wunder isn't dieing
[3:43:06] wigge123: Is the split over for Kcorp now? 0-6 feels hard to comeback from.
[3:43:06] ladderoat: lmao
[3:43:10] fatalqwerty: is cabo bad or is it just KC in its entirety that's super bad rn?
[3:43:11] t3hf4ult: First good package Pog
[3:43:13] TastyAMG: @kerokerogrips They've been dead for too long at this point
[3:43:15] kookoolau: it is too easy
[3:43:17] scully645: let's see the damage graph
[3:43:18] spucky117: I HAVE PACKAGE... oh no i took a draven auto... need to heal ... i have package.... oops i need to heal... i have PACKAGE ... oh i missed
[3:43:19] najafan: @fatalqwerty Yes
[3:43:20] 4blaze2that0: @wigge123 it's basically impossible since they lost to giants and vit
[3:43:20] Camer0n000: should they try giving targ like naut or blitz I know he won’t hit many hooks but like press r and be a tank
[3:43:21] AzureCatalyst: @fatalqwerty Everyone sucks and the team is disfunctional
[3:43:21] TastyAMG: @fatalqwerty Yes he is bad
[3:43:26] Writzo: oh I thought Kaiser was a giant just then LMAO
[3:43:26] GodlyFabio: @TastyAMG Cabo is not a rookie, but I think he might honestly be the worst side by side with Szygenda, Saken is very meh, Bo has no laners, and Upset has no support, so in reality they play 2x5 everygame
[3:43:26] zionsick: I feel bad for Yamato lol
[3:43:26] TastyAMG: So his Saken and Targa
[3:43:27] hotblew1337: @wigge123 need to go undefeated to even think of making playoffsf
[3:43:32] pleblurker9: Upset : 30 min , 0 kills , farm more buddy
[3:43:42] tmihee: @najafan bro he fucked up even on nami
[3:43:49] deadpoool04: if they lose to rogue they are going 0-9 right ?
[3:43:52] TastyAMG: @GodlyFabio Yes you're right, im a bit tired atm LuL

[3:44:01] Savvasp96: Are you guys still doing Powerspike?
[3:44:01] TheMommik: @TastyAMG This week Upset was also checked out and straight bad
[3:44:02] 4blaze2that0: yea rogue is probably their only chance for a win
[3:44:12] najafan: @tmihee Look, he can't engage on Raka or Janna. You can TRY to engage on Nami.
[3:44:12] Toaster321: red and purple guns at the end there XD
[3:44:14] Camer0n000: the funny thing about the bad communication is a set of 3 played for a whole year and a set of 2 played for a year together
[3:44:18] Play_Time7: i think they have voicecoms yt video
[3:44:22] fljqpy: wonder why vitality was 10th place last year
[3:44:26] 4blaze2that0: not yet for week2
[3:44:26] Play_Time7: nemesis said something about it
[3:44:28] QuackTheDuck: BO talks a lot
[3:44:30] najafan: @najafan Is he gonna fucking cyclone to engage?
[3:44:33] 4blaze2that0: he did look at week 1 comms
[3:44:39] QuackTheDuck: Upset wants to catch waves too much
[3:44:54] GodlyFabio: @TheMommik I think Upset checking out is a symptom, of having a bad support perma, I know for sure I do when I get a bad one in SoloQ, can only imagine having to play pro with Targamas
