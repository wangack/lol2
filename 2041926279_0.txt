[1:03:25] DRVBakx: as tu get la soeur de jojo finalement ?
[1:03:30] DRVBakx: on veut les potins
[1:03:50] kittoimp: Is furieuse/ furieux not the correct usage of beskerer in french?
[1:03:56] koopator: The other thing that makes it hard to rate this iteration because there are only 8 teams
[1:04:09] shadowymisstep: What is competitive integrity
[1:04:12] shadowymisstep: Not real to me
[1:04:12] DRVBakx: furieux is more angry tho
[1:04:18] matthew0zz: 8 teams would technically mean more competitive teams
[1:04:25] ayalabrennan515: how different is quebecois than french proper
[1:04:31] DRVBakx: @ayalabrennan515 alot
[1:04:32] littleindianman12: so what is the current handshake meta in the C9 house

[1:09:11] shadowymisstep: Okay fair
[1:09:16] jaggi123: a moose always beats a car
[1:09:17] shadowymisstep: Okay if you hit a moose on the highway you're fucking dead
[1:09:21] eatmygerms_: moose vs deer hitting ur car is a little different
[1:09:29] littleindianman12: is tipping culture as bad as is it is in the US
[1:09:34] KaelinTV: As a bard main, I approve.
[1:09:35] shadowymisstep: @littleindianman12 Probably
[1:09:38] littleindianman12: compared to canada
[1:09:39] matthew0zz: moose like double size of deer

[1:10:34] eatmygerms_: tbf moose probably stand still and are fine. Deer seem too seek out moving vehicles
[1:10:36] shadowymisstep: @owneurmen Oh don't start this
[1:11:04] JeuSerieux: We sold Alaska for 1$ back in the days
[1:11:06] matthew0zz: Alaska is its own country basically lets be real

[2:41:50] reticlestangent: @c9islife basically gold penalty now applies to all who have supp item and multiple supp items have a shared minion penalty
[2:42:00] reticlestangent: they also decreased bloodsong exposure dmg by 2%
[2:42:08] reticlestangent: on both ranged and melee
[2:42:23] ManimalGames: THAT WAS GROSS
[2:42:25] saboneteroxo2: bomba
