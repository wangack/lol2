[5:06:22] Jake96: nah top lane so good
[5:06:26] DevilDolls: Top lane sufferer for over  10 years kek
[5:06:28] Noble_Wolf25: he runs out of mana quickly
[5:06:29] Jake96: mid lane is stressful
[5:06:32] Massattackk: top - easyest)
[5:06:33] Renfuryy: mid is worse imo
[5:06:33] nishinga: I main top and it can be a living hell if you lose lane
[5:06:36] ewhiiii: i think we need to rave harder fuegoRave tipAmen tipWop
[5:06:44] Renfuryy: mid you can get attacked from 2 sides, top theres only 1
[5:06:47] CallMeFritho: Mid you can get attacked from bot and top.
[5:06:47] yamzprime: mid is the worst for sure
[5:06:58] Massattackk: !desi
[5:07:03] DevilDolls: Nothing better than breaking someone top lane, that lane is mentally taxing
[5:07:11] nishinga: but if you lose lane top and they freeze on you, you can’t play the game haha
[5:07:11] Lichcult: top is the most devastating if behind but in terms of difficulty all things considered i'd say bot lane. so much jungle pressure/skirmish heavy bs down there 24/7
[5:07:23] cosmin284: fuegoRave fuegoSpin desiJAM fuegoVibe
[5:07:36] nishinga: top lane when you get ahead is fucking amazing
[5:07:41] CallMeFritho: What's the difference between top and bot?
[5:07:51] Lichcult: @CallMeFritho top is 1v1 bot is 2v2
[5:07:51] the_bhagwan: top lane is much longer than mid lane
[5:08:02] CallMeFritho: @Lichcult If you set it up that way
[5:08:05] the_bhagwan: so if ur wave is in a bad spot in top u just lose
[5:08:07] the_bhagwan: it never bounces
[5:08:13] ewhiiii: top is lonely island LUL
[5:08:14] DevilDolls: If I'm ahead of you top lane and you're not getting help from your jungle, you're not playing the game lmao
[5:08:15] Lichcult: @CallMeFritho it's setup that way 99.9% of games and how the meta is
[5:08:17] HoneycombTV: LOL
[5:08:24] Massattackk: @ewhiiii SURE!
[5:08:29] CallMeFritho: I always went 1 top, 2 mid, 1 bot and 1 jungle we always won back in the day.
[5:08:31] ev3rlasting4: Having a teammate isn't always a good thing :D
