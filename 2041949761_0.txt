[1:59:12] TheZeitHeist: I think liandrys first on zyra better unless ur whole team is ap or something
[1:59:20] softlysupports: my dorm is cold in the winter the walls are thin i can hear a girl grind coffee every day BocchiPossessed
[1:59:31] MissJenella: oh nooo
[1:59:33] trunnpet: @softlysupports bruh that sucks
[1:59:42] cheeselordman: when does ranked go down
[1:59:48] trunnpet: i hear my neighbor's TV constantly in my student apartment and their alarm wakes me up every morning lol
[1:59:50] springrollnoodle: @thezeitheist alright thanks!
[1:59:52] trunnpet: student housing is a monstrosity
[1:59:59] insularis128: @softlysupports that sucks tbh
[2:00:08] softlysupports: lol yeaah and i actually have a pretty decent single dorm i think
[2:00:20] Trollflix: playing adc feels like a rich people
[2:00:26] Trollflix: as a support
[2:00:32] trunnpet: single dorms are pretty sick tbh, is it possible to put in a maintenance order for ur heating? maybe they need to replace a filter
[2:00:40] saintopiaa: anyone remember when nickelodeon would go down for a hour for kids to go outside but they just swapped to cartoon network?
[2:00:58] softlysupports: i read that due to hvac blah blah blah it tends to not be so good in the upper floors
[2:01:00] trunnpet: world wide day of play (worldwide watch cartoon network day)
[2:01:09] softlysupports: so i think im screwed forever idk elisBlob
[2:01:12] trunnpet: unfortunate Smoge
[2:01:17] Drayssen: @saintopiaa wasn't it called like play60 or something
[2:01:38] softlysupports: clapp
[2:01:40] MissJenella: niiice
[2:01:41] ChromaKhroma: all the flashes
[2:01:48] saintopiaa: @Drayssen i think so lol
[2:01:52] bazkera: nice bait clapp
[2:01:58] ablano_mor: did u know they will midscope sera to be a support
[2:02:40] MissJenella: not confirmed yet, and I hope to dear god no.
[2:03:16] ablano_mor: @MissJenella oh they will make sure to milk the sera support mains XD
[2:03:45] MissJenella: it's so bullshit cause she was released as a mid lane mage and I've played her there since she came out
[2:04:07] MissJenella: and she functions better as a carry but people just play her as supp for some dumb reason
[2:04:24] stefenstream: I got a Tiktok vid poppin out yesterday I'm happy catBlush
[2:04:49] Sanecore: her ult is too strong she needs a complete rework
[2:05:02] Stitch_suplol: not very playable
[2:05:04] Stitch_suplol: Feels  bad man
[2:05:20] ablano_mor: @MissJenella u can never interact with her as a carry which is why i guess they want to remove that frustration
[2:05:26] softlysupports: @softlysupports omg wilfwid!! haaai :3
[2:05:29] Senyuno: 1-1 is surprising
[2:05:39] MissJenella: @ablano_mor idk people are just bad players then
[2:05:45] softlysupports: ive actually only played 11 games in two days combined which is a looot for me lately Smoge
[2:05:53] wilfrLd: lacWow Sofiwaaa hachuWave
[2:05:53] ablano_mor: @MissJenella she fits the standards in the way she looks maybe
[2:05:56] MissJenella: @softlysupports wew
[2:06:03] MissJenella: I have barely played league lately
[2:06:08] softlysupports: saaame
[2:06:10] trunnpet: there is counterplay to her as a carry
[2:06:12] ChromaKhroma: i havent played in at least 2 weeks
[2:06:14] softlysupports: like i hadnt played ranked in forever
[2:06:15] denunciator: chat on the bottom left? howody
[2:06:22] softlysupports: but i think i can play more this semester
[2:06:23] ChromaKhroma: havent played new season at all
[2:06:25] Stitch_suplol: whenever sera is playable as mid or ad game is garbo
[2:06:27] trunnpet: there's much more counterplay than a champion like yone, lb, or akali
[2:06:31] ablano_mor: @MissJenella but if i can ask, how are they bad when sera can just clear the wave from afar and just waits for the next one under her tower XD
[2:06:33] MissJenella: @ablano_mor probably yea, it's just frustrating having another mid mage that I play kidnapped/forced into support again when I don't play the role
[2:06:37] softlysupports: my first semester jitters arent as bad anymore
[2:06:56] trunnpet: do u want riot to gut waveclear or what . like huh
[2:07:01] Stitch_suplol: u cant interact with her, she just 1 shots wave at infinite range and scaled too well into late with low eco cuz her abilities are too supporty
[2:07:08] Stitch_suplol: if shes support game is more fair
[2:07:14] dyleni: I'm working in 30 mins but i work from home so i put stunt on my tv and whenever theres not a lot of work i take a peek stuntCozy
[2:07:29] softlysupports: peepoBlushComfy
[2:07:48] kikoenaiyo: WatchingStream
[2:07:49] ablano_mor: @MissJenella yeah i got that, but isnt that just a bad design aspects? all the mage supports failed in their original role, minus zyra who was made to be a mage support
[2:08:03] HwmTheWigl: It's cursed
[2:08:08] MissJenella: @ablano_mor kill her like what just happened on stream stuntLUL
[2:08:21] dyleni: I was trynna work tho and i saw you picking teemo sup yday and I'm like whaaa üëÄ
[2:08:34] MissJenella: @ablano_mor yea riot failed to support them
[2:08:47] trunnpet: idk why ppl are acting like she can waveclear from 2 screens away when many mages also have long distance wave clear
[2:08:54] trunnpet: and better scalings than her lol
[2:08:55] exuvium: i got fired watching stunt's teemo support Despairge
[2:09:02] Stitch_suplol: just watch this game as ask yourself if any other adc got shafted this hard if they would be this useful
[2:09:03] softlysupports: yeah like lux Scared
[2:09:09] sleepythe_wizard: @exuvium NOOOO
[2:09:18] MissJenella: yea I think people literally just are biased cause they don't play the champion and think she's so easy to play
[2:09:20] dyleni: Did sera get nerfed
[2:09:21] exuvium: nono lol
[2:09:24] trunnpet: they'd be more useful
[2:09:26] exuvium: LULW

[2:09:53] Trollflix: TP no value so far
[2:10:00] MissJenella: I mean, she's easy but like you can still win depending on other game conditions lol
[2:10:05] TheZeitHeist: Yea people always say sup is easy then have 15% winrate on it
[2:10:09] chicken_dmp: no support item?
[2:10:09] jannablowsu: @MissJenella what champ are you talking about
[2:10:09] trunnpet: ppl are always super quick to shit on enchanters idk
[2:10:11] ablano_mor: @MissJenella i guess, that is why she is not mid often there, because she gets countered by a lot of champs
[2:10:18] kikoenaiyo: supports are in good position, it just botlane is very weak to gank, so jungler constantly coming bot
[2:10:21] kikoenaiyo: kek
[2:10:23] MissJenella: @ablano_mor yea her matchups can be painful mid
[2:10:24] softlysupports: seraphines actually hard to play imo quantPeek2

[2:10:37] cristinoruwu: @softlysupports i do agree with this nodd
[2:10:38] softlysupports: like if u dont main her good luck hitting her skills they just feel so weird to me
[2:10:42] jannablowsu: @TheZeitHeist i mean tbf supp is by a wide mile the easiest role
[2:10:48] MissJenella: @softlysupports yea they're slow
[2:11:00] MissJenella: whenever I play against one I laugh as I dodge everything
[2:11:02] jannablowsu: esp now with all the gold
[2:11:02] stefenstream: -1
[2:11:08] TheZeitHeist: @jannablowsu i dont think so i played every role to masters and they felt about all the same
[2:11:11] MissJenella: but then it's prob cause I've played her so much I know what they want to do
[2:11:14] softlysupports: @softlysupports baseg
[2:11:55] softlysupports: yasuo Scared
[2:12:00] trunnpet: support might be easiest to learn but it has the least amt of carry potential
[2:12:00] MissJenella: I hate playing vs yasuo -_-
[2:12:01] TheZeitHeist: my point wasnt about sup tho its about the people who say its easy then i op.gg them and they are 15% winrate on sup lol
[2:12:02] jannablowsu: yasuo Scared
[2:12:09] exuvium: LULW  Û†ÄÄ

[2:14:48] xgeodeex: you go support item at 4 right
[2:15:05] softlysupports: gragas support seems so strong
[2:15:10] Stitch_suplol: ideally first base on 800g and get tear + supp item
[2:15:21] Stitch_suplol: prob fine give gold to team while u get gold
[2:16:09] MissJenella: yea the 800g back is best
[2:16:13] Stitch_suplol: my bad was responding to someone in chat, I wasnt tryn to vod u
