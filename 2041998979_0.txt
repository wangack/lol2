[0:34:02] Gunstar_Hero: @heyhellos no you don't any lawyer would take that case because you get the fees paid when you win. that's a slam dunk
[0:34:07] INFAMOUSxIIx: It'll probably not make it to a lawsuit and end as a settlement most likely. They'll still get paid out

[0:35:31] mrq_returns: Insider tradingggg
[0:35:39] Eye_dr0ps_: Da fuq @yougelly
[0:35:50] neekolovebot: how does that work
[0:36:04] lilwun: puts?
[0:36:04] icecool2020: not insider trading, it is a purchase based off of a public performance of the comapny
[0:36:22] DKSG12L: it's called short selling
[0:36:23] GergWasHere: bought short prob
[0:36:28] heyhellos: ye
[0:36:36] mrq_returns: You're saying it right
[0:36:36] katinent: stonks NODDERS
[0:36:37] heyhellos: I’ve heard of insider trading
[0:36:43] keptnice: ur betting against the company essentially, idk how it works
[0:36:48] Dust___________________: explain it in sally terms frfr
[0:36:56] heyhellos: It’s like when u use insider info to help u earn money thru stocks
[0:36:57] GergWasHere: borrow a tock for $10, price drops, buy back for 5 and then return the stock, making the $5 spread
[0:36:58] DKSG12L: basically you sell first and bought back the same amount of shares you sold previously later
[0:37:06] lilwun: i've heard of people who buy into day trading as well, like pay to get the advice of someone else doing it
[0:37:08] neekolovebot: OHHHH
[0:37:16] heyhellos: Like u got insider information that will help I know when the stocks go up or down
[0:37:23] mrq_returns: Shorts when you think it's gonna drop, long is you think it's gonna rise, put is when you dont want it to rise
[0:37:24] Eye_dr0ps_: I'm jumping out
[0:37:25] zzz_zzzm: yes
[0:37:26] heyhellos: U know *

[0:37:29] Eye_dr0ps_: With a parachute
[0:38:01] neekolovebot: to think of stonk mid near death experience is wild LOL
[0:38:12] Eye_dr0ps_: That would be called short-term capitulation and a stock of that size doesn't really feel the aftershock
[0:38:14] just_jayway: ???????????????
[0:38:18] neekolovebot: LOL
[0:38:25] Eye_dr0ps_: unless it's continual
[0:38:29] lilwun: Binoculars
[0:38:37] mrq_returns: We've all been there !
[0:38:37] Dust___________________: so thats why ahri is getting buffed Hmm
[0:38:54] Eye_dr0ps_: so wouldn't is my answer
[0:39:26] katinent: monkaW
[0:39:35] Dust___________________: monkaOMEGA
[0:39:52] heyhellos: Insider trading is like  ur company leaks information that the general public is not aware of  u then use the information to help u buy stocks at a cheaper price before the price rises or whatever
[0:39:59] heyhellos: thus helping u to earn money with information that u know that is not known by the public
[0:40:00] mrq_returns: Sounds like akanasia
[0:40:14] Eye_dr0ps_: I can't
[0:40:36] lilwun: yeah, some people apparently have more awareness during surgery

[0:42:59] Raw_SR: btw i have heard of that before and its pretty common during surgeries. 1 in about every 1000 regain consciousness during surgery and sometimes they suffer from ptsd and stuff from it
[0:43:02] Raw_SR: crazy to think about
[0:43:26] Raw_SR: that would be my biggest fear
[0:43:31] heyhellos: yikes
[0:43:32] Nightbot: !yikes

[0:44:12] Eye_dr0ps_: You ever used gas at the dentist? similar experience
[0:44:13] Raw_SR: @heyhellos yeah what i learned from that is try to never have to go to surgery
[0:44:16] Raw_SR: monkaW
[0:44:26] mrq_returns: It reminds me of Naruto s2 when Rock Lee uses the hidden lotus
[0:44:55] heyhellos: 1 out of 1000 is  1000 ppl every 1 million surgeries
[0:45:14] heyhellos: That’s alotta patients
[0:45:31] neekolovebot: semi........
[0:45:36] Raw_SR: @heyhellos well its surgeries that they have to put people to sleep for which im not sure the percentage of that but still 1 in 1000 seems like a lot
