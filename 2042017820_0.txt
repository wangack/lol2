[0:31:28] Kaype92: in my experience I had a Chinese tutor from china teach me Chinese while my middle school Chinese teacher was Taiwanese so the pronunciations were sometimes different
[0:31:44] RikenTV: this was my issue with duolingo, it doesn't do a good job teaching grammar rules
[0:31:49] Kaype92: not to mention the writing was also different

[0:50:06] Frostao: Chinese is my first language and I remember learning a lot about English grammar
[0:50:23] tobyteemo: well the phrase "my girlfriend" is rare for league players anyway so it's not expected for us to know it anyway
