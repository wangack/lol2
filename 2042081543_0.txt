[2:59:25] S_E_R_E_S: hes doing it
[2:59:45] narnsberg: The argument for Adaptive Force over Move Speed is that the Adaptive Force helps a lot of jgl clear. Which speeds you up on gank timers etc. And the Move Speed effectively gives 7-8 MS depending on the jungler. You'll obviously gain more on champs like Heca when you E or Ghost. But then it comes down to do you even need that extra MS? You're gonna outrun everyone already
