[0:12:51] reeiaa: Aloo

[0:14:18] LapisLazulies: i feel like i should be goombastomping but idk maybe diamond isnt high enough to 1v9 emerald/plat rank
[0:14:23] LapisLazulies: if you arent playing solo lane
[0:14:36] Yasheek_Defender: i dropped for free from e4 to plat 2 0lp by inters, for me its hard a bit too carry as adc hard :D but i back to e4 again..

[3:22:16] MikuChan1998: = pain
[3:22:37] wildriftboi1: what are we cooking with tf?
[3:22:50] cantelar1176: nemesis is rushing trinity as first item
[3:22:51] MikuChan1998: @wildriftboi1 TF just got mental AD ratios added to his kit
[3:23:25] MikuChan1998: wonder how strong karma is
[3:23:32] MikuChan1998: cos she also got super buffed
[3:23:40] MikuChan1998: also yorick getting super buffs on pbe
[3:23:43] MikuChan1998: its mentl
[3:23:55] Potater2K: perhaps ez is strong
[3:24:18] ghidilol: now he ults
[3:24:34] MikuChan1998: ezreal buffs were insanity
[3:24:41] wildriftboi1: @MikuChan1998 hard agree
[3:24:51] wildriftboi1: but they are rly encouraging some triforce ezreal play
[3:24:56] dea1hwish: LETHIMCOOK
[3:25:00] cantelar1176: @Jackspektra idk if u already read it, but nemesis is rushing triforce
[3:25:11] wildriftboi1: nice LUL ez buffs
[3:25:29] wildriftboi1: i just read the patch notes - and poke is a lot more annoying now
[3:25:37] wildriftboi1: i felt that ez ult too
[3:25:56] motiv8r: is ezreal super broken now?
[3:26:00] HylightShow: tf is probably insane in a slower lane or more even support matchup because of the gold gain
[3:26:06] dea1hwish: thank you for ezreal buffs peepoHappy
[3:26:08] ghidilol: i think games going well tho
[3:26:26] wildriftboi1: @dea1hwish they were a bit much but i guess we do say thanks
[3:26:47] dea1hwish: @wildriftboi1 i hate playing vs ezreal Sadge it painful
[3:27:01] MikuChan1998: maybe AD TF Mid is actually viable

[3:29:28] wezqu: felt decent
[3:29:29] wildriftboi1: @HylightShow bloodsong shouldnt be a thing anymore hopefully
[3:29:43] Flowrise: so after that full build guinnso is fine?
[3:29:51] wildriftboi1: at least they removed the double support strat to the dirt

[3:36:19] SeimitsuVT: u played mid or adc?
[3:36:30] peybol9: ruined king could be good or is trolling?
[3:36:48] cantelar1176: as far as the game of nemesis is going, he has triforce and wits end @Jackspektra
[3:37:12] sensejseba: wouldn't tri force be better first item than stormrazor?
[3:38:12] parrotmangirl: go BT 5Head
[3:38:19] ghidilol: fact is build is expensive
[3:38:47] furios_live1: TF adc?

[3:41:59] cantelar1176: urgots backdoor Kappa
[3:42:01] ghidilol: lane was unplayable cuz support matchup i think
[3:42:04] HylightShow: supp needs to not troll, then its probably useful
[3:42:38] MikuChan1998: how much gold has your passive made
[3:43:28] sebasstian_7991: they have good tempo.. compared to ur team
