[1:14:51] BicepSlicerBoy: ^
[1:15:00] elzter_: i am bronze so ye, i think of myself im not bad either but ye
[1:15:16] auri_sariel: @elzter_ im far from bronze i just had 2 bronze ranked players in my last normal match
[1:15:22] auri_sariel: and they were not this bad
[1:15:23] eliotxshadowfrost21: what a grief at the end holy moly. that lushens gameplay should be banned
[1:16:07] elzter_: @auri_sariel ah k ye happens its true, i dont wanna play ranked this season bc ranked is so scuffed imo
[1:16:12] elzter_: doesnt tell anything
[1:16:29] auri_sariel: @elzter_ well apparently with todays patch they improved matchmaking in ranked
[1:16:31] elzter_: imo i play at least one rank better than i am
[1:16:48] elzter_: @auri_sariel yeah i saw it earlier but im still not sure
[1:17:43] auri_sariel: this is basically just hotfix buff for gwen, because the 14.1B nerfed Gwen
[1:18:00] Diamonddusts: Maybe it's the players that are bad, not the champ? o.o
[1:18:24] getsometalentloser: @diamonddusts  what champ
[1:18:45] Diamonddusts: Hwei
[1:18:55] elzter_: hwei she GIGACHAD
[1:18:59] auri_sariel: yeah its hilarious to see when u walk in middle and Illaois tentacles cant reach cause the lanes is wider KEKW
[1:19:05] getsometalentloser: hmm probably I mean there‚Äôs a number of champs that are really strong
[1:19:06] blubbubb: you mean he? XDD
[1:19:24] getsometalentloser: but there popular and most  ppl are dog shit at the game and the champ and drag the win rate down
[1:19:34] nwa4lifeTV: hwei is a guy
[1:19:47] auri_sariel: call him huawei
[1:19:50] nwa4lifeTV: they them, zhey zhem
[1:20:20] auri_sariel: tbh maybe karma needed buff, i havent seen one in a very long time
[1:20:21] koushik_10: ya she was very weak
[1:20:22] nwa4lifeTV: theyre buffing mid karma
[1:20:24] RavensWing: They gave her a huge AP buff
[1:20:28] RavensWing: for mid
[1:20:33] NeverWorse95: I'm such a pro and wholesome player. I just got my 3 Honors Akshan EZ T1 hire me please
[1:20:35] elzter_: buff is huge
[1:21:07] nwa4lifeTV: karthus also
[1:21:11] blubbubb: Karthus is getting buffed too
[1:21:23] elzter_: its soo true hahha
[1:21:40] auri_sariel: ahri got hit so hard by 14.1 , her win rate plummeted from 51% to 48%
[1:21:54] elzter_: yes he is hahaha
[1:22:06] solidussovis: LCK is banning ezreal right now so how weak could he be
[1:22:22] Diamonddusts: XD You could work for riots balance team xD
[1:22:32] nwa4lifeTV: rumble is pro play
[1:23:20] Diamonddusts: How did they fix it? Did they fix it?
[1:23:22] auri_sariel: karthus needs to be nerfed not banned just played against one today, he was being absolutely nuked in jungle by our jungler and he still was destroying us with his R
[1:23:26] auri_sariel: not buffed*
[1:23:31] Diamonddusts: The double support item that is
[1:23:32] Kelvinstv: too  bad they didn't buff zac mid
[1:23:39] nwa4lifeTV: added a gold penalty and both contribute to the gold cap
[1:23:45] sir_jab: Feels like this is a correlation and not a causation moment.
[1:23:47] blubbubb: Phreak gave a reasoning behind Garen buffs
[1:23:56] blubbubb: same for Ezreal, worth checking imo
[1:24:09] auri_sariel: they buffed both Garen and Darius, i bet they wanna see Adam shine KEKW
[1:24:17] blubbubb: I think if you just search on Youtube, he did a rundownd of the patch
[1:24:17] moutusfeeder: Champs shouldnt be based on OTPs only
[1:24:30] elzter_: @auri_sariel omg that was the same thing that came to my mind instantly
[1:24:52] Diamonddusts: I was in an adc channel and they were super surprised at the ez buff and was saying it was way too much of a buff
[1:24:55] getsometalentloser: karma milo lucian rengar
[1:24:58] auri_sariel: @elzter_ i think that was the first thing that came even to Fakers mind in LCK when he saw that KEKW
[1:25:00] getsometalentloser: FUCKING DISGUSTING
[1:25:15] PigeonSenti: done proxying?
[1:25:50] getsometalentloser: they only buffed him casual he‚Äôs popular and they don‚Äôt want the baddies  dragging his win rate to quite
[1:25:53] getsometalentloser: quit*
[1:26:03] elzter_: @auri_sariel when will this patch go live in lec?
[1:26:03] auri_sariel: isnt it hilarious how the GODS song was made for Deft yet now everyone even in LPL and LCK associate the GODS with Adam
[1:26:03] nwa4lifeTV: 4Head
[1:26:06] getsometalentloser: is vi good this patch ?
[1:26:15] auri_sariel: @elzter_ my guess is in regular stage, so after week 3

[1:26:48] DuskDash: do u think ekko jg is playable or go mid
[1:26:57] auri_sariel: @DuskDash in solo queue yes
[1:27:55] lubemila: santorinWave
[1:28:17] blubbubb: oh, I'm sorry for posting the yt link, didn't know you get timed out
[1:28:29] auri_sariel: is it sundered sky first or black cleaver first? i seen some rush black cleaver Vis
[1:28:42] elzter_: dont think so
[1:29:13] auri_sariel: @Santorin you saying i should go ahri jungle? :3
[1:29:44] elzter_: ive also seen once that otps are better most of the time than people just following meta
[1:29:56] elzter_: bc they know their champ better
[1:30:03] louiecheese: I‚Äôm late
[1:30:11] elzter_: than just havin basic knowledge of eryone
[1:30:22] auri_sariel: KEKW

[1:31:31] auri_sariel: yeah it makes sense i understand
[1:32:05] elzter_: hahaha
[1:32:08] elzter_: what an example
[1:32:16] ChaosRenown: udyr KEKW
[1:32:26] auri_sariel: well the  good thing about udyr is, while he is hyper broken early, he falls off hard later
[1:32:28] Kelvinstv: is udyr jungle any good?
[1:33:54] elzter_: did anyone see lck earlier? where fearX chased after udyr and lost the game bc of it? KEKW
[1:34:23] getsometalentloser: an active bit lane
[1:34:30] getsometalentloser: moving when ur invading
[1:34:35] getsometalentloser: got a stiffy
[1:34:59] auri_sariel: @elzter_ yeah like IWDominate said, most of teams in LCK are in general gigatrash, theres 3-4 world class teams and then 6-7 extremely weak underwhelming teams
[1:35:55] auri_sariel: cause their best players converge in less teams together and not spread out to different teams
[1:36:04] elzter_: ah yeah get it
[1:36:18] elzter_: i hope dk will perform better this year, last year was very sad
[1:36:29] Iamaf33d3r: we quit our job today
[1:36:36] Iamaf33d3r: found a new one Pog
[1:36:42] louiecheese: Nice
[1:37:03] elzter_: damn ksante survived?
[1:37:05] elzter_: sheesh
[1:37:05] auri_sariel: C9 did this too this season, literally theres only C9 in LCS now, they got the best player in LCS for each role, now there is C9 and a bunch of Karmine Corps there
[1:37:07] Iamaf33d3r: have 3 weeks of vacation in between too =D
[1:37:15] DocPhosis: santorin doing drags in solo q??
[1:38:09] elzter_: omfg ksante gaming
[1:38:13] auri_sariel: that Ksante played it giga good
[1:38:17] elzter_: love to see it (NOT)
[1:38:28] Silfel: K'Sante pasta PauseChamp
[1:39:03] radley_b: New patch day? Maybe jungle viable again? BatChest
[1:39:28] auri_sariel: @Santorin I have a question for you Santorini! if its fine
[1:41:00] elzter_: btw why does no one in high elo play soraka?
[1:41:11] DocPhosis: i flinched
[1:41:39] Alberkahn: @elzter_ she aint good
[1:42:10] elzter_: i mean im soraka main imo she isnt lol
[1:42:17] auri_sariel: My question is: Who is the best player for EACH role in LEC right now after 2 weeks in your opinion without analysing it too much, who gave you the best impressions for each role @Santorin
[1:43:34] Silfel: Did the Lee want jungle or what?
[1:43:39] elzter_: no
[1:43:41] elzter_: lol
[1:43:46] supercole2001: Hey Lucas how are yo utoday?
[1:44:35] elzter_: yike mhm
[1:44:39] auri_sariel: @Santorin your subjective opinion you dont have to analyse it to detail, just ur impression
[1:44:40] TiGer568: @Santorin What you build on Vi? Which items are best on her?
[1:45:15] Alberkahn: Tough question, no one player comes to mind for really standing out imo at least
[1:45:17] elzter_: oh wow
[1:45:23] elzter_: didnt expect u to get him tbh
[1:45:24] auri_sariel: cause i hear a lot of people say BB is the best top laner but in last 2 seasons i think Irrelevant was by far the best top laner
[1:45:44] elzter_: omg bbs last game cough
[1:45:54] elzter_: pain
[1:46:11] Kelvinstv: wtf why does TP takes so long now?
[1:46:25] NeverWorse95: i still miss the original mafia miss fortune FeelsBadMan
[1:46:41] elzter_: letsgo
[1:46:52] elzter_: so g2 best team agree
[1:46:57] elzter_: CarlSmile
[1:47:03] auri_sariel: the biggest pain watching HansSama is watching his Varus, holy shit he holds his R for way too long every single time
[1:47:04] Alberkahn: G2 vs G3 was a decen tgame
[1:47:14] elzter_: LUL
[1:47:55] Alberkahn: damn no damage
[1:48:05] auri_sariel: @Santorin you need to do the Karthus message Phreak meme but alter it for Ksantes tp, i mean Phreak told us to type it out KEKW
[1:48:46] Alberkahn: liandrys udyr, jesus guys still livin in the past
[1:50:17] NeverWorse95: Was Blitzcrank really this broken to have him nerfed this patch?
[1:50:18] TiGer568: @Santorin Is Triniti bad on Vi now?
[1:50:54] Alberkahn: i prefer triforce on vi, everything she needs it provides
[1:51:16] auri_sariel: when u want ur karthus to press R because u got the enemy low hp but cause of the ping nerfs, its for party only so he doesnt see it and Phreak told everyone to type it out instead and he got shit on so hard for it he disabled all his social media for criticism
[1:51:17] elzter_: this udyr isnt good luckily
[1:52:02] elzter_: what shield? GIGACHAD Kappa
[1:52:42] Kelvinstv: whats the ping nerf?
[1:52:57] shadow7master: udyr made only for trick2g KappaCool
[1:53:26] Alberkahn: who needs mid LUL
[1:53:26] auri_sariel: Santorini there was a video made for the Karthus meme, can i post it here for you? @Santorin
[1:53:38] Kelvinstv: you can only ping a certain amount or something?
[1:53:39] Ace_strup: gg ez

[1:53:49] auri_sariel: https://youtu.be/mtYQAW9knEY
[1:53:58] auri_sariel: watch it, it made me laugh so hard XD
[1:54:10] getsometalentloser: thoughts on shaco rn?
[1:54:12] Alberkahn: surely you honor lee no?
[1:54:24] supercole2001: still doing palworld on queue?
[1:54:56] Silfel: danClueless
[1:55:11] Kelvinstv: you can only 5 times and then wait 1 min?
[1:55:27] blubbubb: oh my god, did he not like the Garen buff explanation?
[1:55:30] elzter_: bahaha
[1:55:31] 88_dohko: @auri_sariel LUL
[1:55:33] auri_sariel: ahahaha XD
[1:55:41] yepein73: Hi santorin good luck have a great day
[1:55:42] TiGer568: @Santorin Tell us best build on Vi please! :)
[1:55:52] auri_sariel: @Santorin Phreak  got so much criticism for that comment he disabled all his social media
[1:55:59] auri_sariel: for quite a long time
[1:56:25] shadow7master: phreak push ppl to be inovative KEKW
[1:56:27] elzter_: hahaha
[1:56:28] Silfel: Garen is too hard PepeHands
[1:56:34] blubbubb: let him cook though
[1:56:35] getsometalentloser: phreak looking like Homer Simpson
[1:56:53] Alberkahn: Just make Garens Q a leap and its all gravy
[1:56:54] eliotxshadowfrost21: point and click lee sin would be fucked
[1:56:58] divin3cha0s: make w a dash dont need wards
[1:57:08] divin3cha0s: you can just w anywhere that would be fun
[1:57:16] elzter_: ah ye i still dont get why hes allowed to patch champions lmfao
[1:57:19] divin3cha0s: 15%
[1:57:23] auri_sariel: i swear to god Phreak gives me the impression of not even playing the game anymore, holy fck, what is he saying
[1:57:25] divin3cha0s: LOL
[1:57:32] catlover12435: bro WHAT
[1:57:33] blubbubb: I think his point was that Garen is meant to be played by low elo, and in low elo he's not too powerful?
[1:57:42] divin3cha0s: nvm 30% wtf
[1:57:53] solidussovis: it is if you look that it doesn't scale anymore its a flat 4
[1:57:56] eliotxshadowfrost21: and yet gwen gets .07 garen gets literally double of 2.0
[1:58:16] auri_sariel: BRUH he scales even faster now KEKW
[1:58:23] Ace_strup: bufff sonaaaaaaaaaa
[1:59:27] auri_sariel: "We dont want Garen to scale so hard, we want him to feel like a normal champion at all times" -Phreak after not nerfing Garens scaling and instead make him scale faster than before KEKW
[1:59:31] elzter_: garentee
[1:59:33] elzter_: Kappa
[1:59:39] blubbubb: KEKW
[1:59:43] Alberkahn: Garentee haHAA
[1:59:44] shadow7master: since phreak get camped by diana jng last year he is runing it down KEKW
[2:00:14] solidussovis: Just making phase rush garen a god
[2:00:24] ucandoit69: Garen Tea
[2:00:31] Alberkahn: phase rush beyblade since the E has more scaling LUL
[2:01:25] auri_sariel: i think the buffed W makes him much stronger now because he can  trade better in lane now @Santorin youre absolutely right
[2:01:44] solidussovis: It seems like everything is based on how Phreak would like it, and he ignores what actually will happen
[2:02:32] Alberkahn: Maybe, W still has a bit of a cooldown and it falls off into the late game a little bit compared to before, Make Q a leap, increase th eCd of W a bit and leave it as it was
[2:03:12] eliotxshadowfrost21: my question is why they gotta explain themselves about why they did what they did with champions. if it was a good buff there shouldnt be need of explanation and the community shouldnt have questions about it
[2:03:32] solidussovis: @eliotxshadowfrost21 TRUEEE
[2:03:35] Kithlan: @solidussovis Seems like most game balance teams tend to fall into this trap eventually, where one or a few people's whims are focused on over actual balance
[2:03:37] baevermaas: can you play ww soon please? @Santorin
[2:03:48] Alberkahn: @eliotxshadowfrost21 Have you seen the league community? LUL they question everything
[2:04:01] auri_sariel: the more im hearing Phreak in this vid the more im getting the feeling he has no idea how the game works anymore, wtf is he saying
[2:04:35] solidussovis: Dude if anyone is an American Football fan we have been calling Phreak the John Madden of league for years
[2:04:46] solidussovis: he has lost it before he left the caster table
[2:04:50] baevermaas: @Santorin you banned ww again... peepoLeave
[2:04:52] Kithlan: @eliotxshadowfrost21 Devs explaining their thought processes to players is never a bad thing
[2:04:55] divin3cha0s: xin
[2:05:04] Lauritzzen: Why ban warwick?
[2:05:05] nwa4lifeTV: graves is very soft now
[2:05:25] Kithlan: Especially with balance concerns, where no one can ever agree on what changes to make LUL
[2:05:34] baevermaas: peepoLeave he bans warwick he wants me to leave peepoLeave
[2:06:00] ucandoit69: Nessie
[2:06:21] auri_sariel: MR and armor runes were removed yea
[2:06:39] divin3cha0s: bro this is insane nullifying orb value
[2:07:01] divin3cha0s: early hexdringer is a must this game
[2:07:17] blubbubb: BuT wE LikE DiVeRSityY
[2:07:19] auri_sariel: i honestly think theres way too many champs now to make all champs viable, unfortunately thats impossible X_X
[2:07:21] baevermaas: @Santorin have you watched stuff about the new champ?
[2:07:55] blubbubb: Senna didn't buy items
[2:07:57] elzter_: yeah true
[2:08:06] nwa4lifeTV: senna is 5Head
[2:08:14] elzter_: imo they really should stop releasing champs
[2:08:15] divin3cha0s: get 2 bans lol
[2:08:19] FreudvsSkinner: Time for League 2
[2:08:35] blubbubb: oh dear...
[2:08:43] eliotxshadowfrost21: @Kithlan it can be a bit of a mistake though if its clearly not the issues a champion is having. especially if the community has been constantly saying what would fix a champion and they go "so heres what we did" when its got nothing to do with the issue that just feeds the idea they dont even care what the community thinks and thats a bad move
[2:08:53] auri_sariel: well the league director said in his tweet that league of legends will change forever in 2025, so they clearly has some huge changes for 2025
[2:09:25] brightdiscord: @auri_sariel finally they will shut it down AngelThump
[2:09:25] Silfel: @auri_sariel or it's just talk
[2:09:44] auri_sariel: @Silfel Well i wonder what does he mean by change league forever, like in what way
[2:10:03] elzter_: theyll delete yuumi and shaco Kappa
[2:10:05] ootori: trueeee
[2:10:11] Silfel: @elzter_ danP
[2:10:28] FreudvsSkinner: I can't handle all the new items
[2:10:29] baevermaas: they could do a rotating champ pool. Like they do map pools for cs kinda
[2:10:51] Dewmrik: season 2, back when there was a new champion to learn every single patch?
[2:11:57] elzter_: yep
[2:11:58] divin3cha0s: fck onetricks
[2:12:17] blubbubb: that would ruin the W/L ratios for players
[2:12:21] TakingtheCake: It's not just one tricks though it's also pocket picks that players have to counter shit
[2:12:21] auri_sariel: @Santorin what do you think the league director meant in his tweet when he said "In 2025 league of legends will change forever"
[2:12:25] Kithlan: "Jungler, I have run it down because I suck at my lane. This is clearly your fault for not giga-ganking my lane." Kappa
[2:12:32] solidussovis: They already have too many champs.
[2:13:04] solidussovis: You can't balance a game you keep coming out with new champs with broken kits
[2:13:07] baevermaas: ''aint no hwei'' this guy lucas a comedian
[2:13:12] nwa4lifeTV: proguides Kappa
[2:13:14] Kithlan: Investing 200 years just to learn how Aphelios works PepeHands
[2:13:57] solidussovis: It sounds bad, but they should nerf half the champs to unplayable if they want to balance anything
[2:14:18] divin3cha0s: lvl 4 panth into sion what happened
[2:15:07] Silfel: I don't think anyone likes bounties
[2:15:50] Ammst4r: Would u completely get rid of the bounty system or just nerf it?
[2:15:50] elzter_: and then they do it with a yone
[2:15:51] Dewmrik: the alternative is you lose a 40 minute game at 3 minutes, i'll take bounties
[2:15:53] Kithlan: I like objective bounties, but champ bounties are way too much; 1000g, big oof
[2:16:08] blubbubb: @Dewmrik agreed
[2:16:59] auri_sariel: @Kithlan i kinda like bounties i like the idea of having a chance to return back to the game,without bounties many games are irreversably over after 12-15 minutes
[2:17:15] nwa4lifeTV: SourPls
[2:17:22] elzter_: u like ketchup? me too
[2:17:54] Silfel: Sion Q hitbox rexOk
[2:18:02] Kithlan: @auri_sariel Yeah, it just shouldn't be a complete reversal. Maybe 300g extra at most for big bounties, not 700g
[2:18:07] blubbubb: I don't think 1000g bounty matters that much in low elo though
[2:18:17] nwa4lifeTV: it goes well with streak Kappa
[2:18:22] nwa4lifeTV: *steak
[2:18:26] divin3cha0s: get mawe
[2:18:32] Kithlan: @blubbubb But who balances for low elo
[2:18:43] GhostxxHorse: do you put ketchup on your pasta like Mr. Broxah?
[2:18:54] divin3cha0s: is maw second good?
[2:19:01] divin3cha0s: its 65 ad
[2:19:19] auri_sariel: @Santorin in low elo the skill gap is too huge, when one team is skillwise stronger early, it doesnt change later on, they are still gonna get shit  on hard even if they have 4k gold lead for example
[2:19:22] Ammst4r: Do you think different changes in terms of elo could be a thing? Like for example nerfing bounties in higher elo, but not in lower. @Santorin
[2:19:24] blubbubb: I mean, yeah they balance for high elo, but I don't feel like they should completely disregard over 80% ov the playerbase
[2:19:30] blubbubb: of*
[2:19:37] divin3cha0s: but why is karma getting buffed though
[2:19:42] divin3cha0s: i dont understand
[2:19:54] Silfel: Apparently her winrate was below 50
[2:19:58] Kithlan: Yeah, but balancing around people who are bad at the game is not really a feasible task
[2:20:32] ScoreMore: just get good tho
[2:20:34] Kithlan: How do you correct things for people who play incorrectly
[2:20:44] blubbubb: @Kithlan oh I agree, probably no good middle ground there XD
[2:21:06] brightdiscord: @Kithlan you must correct the people themselves  ReallyMad
[2:21:31] Kithlan: I dunno the population distribution, but like Emerald+ is enough, I'd think
[2:21:44] Silfel: I thought it was nerfed so much it's not worth it now rooThink
[2:22:14] Kithlan: Balancing around Emerald+, I should say
[2:23:05] blubbubb: I know some of these things like AD shyv LeBlanc is annoying af, but I am always impressed how creative League players can be
[2:23:16] blubbubb: to come up with that, takes some knowledge
[2:23:17] auri_sariel: i remember when i was playing ahri ADC with AD build with my b est friend who played blitz, the damage was shiet later but early the combo was deadly af  KEKW
[2:23:23] auri_sariel: in like season 6
[2:23:24] Alberkahn: very disjointed team :)
[2:23:43] stslimited84: This game is done bruh
[2:23:59] Alberkahn: bad draft too actually yeah, jesus as if no one dodged
[2:24:02] GideonBast: @Santorin Does ezreal feel useless in high elo or is it only a low elo problem?
[2:24:03] Kithlan: @blubbubb Must always be fun for the dev teams, when they see some new tech and they're just like "what the fuck" LUL
[2:24:16] blubbubb: @Kithlan right on! hahaha
[2:24:26] auri_sariel: KEKW wtf
[2:24:50] Alberkahn: Baussen Law
[2:25:00] auri_sariel: this Leblanc jump back reminded me of Perkz LB in LCS times
[2:25:13] tugwos: Joined just in time for a "WHAT???".  What the odds of that.  Actually, pretty good (<:
[2:26:11] elzter_: gg
[2:26:19] ucandoit69: its never my fault Kappa
[2:26:33] stslimited84: The problem is you didn't pick bel veth
[2:26:36] baevermaas: should have picked ww
[2:26:42] baevermaas: and you would have been golden
[2:28:20] blubbubb: oh my god, that guy must have lost his mind there
[2:28:27] blubbubb: feel so bad for that Panth :(
[2:28:53] blubbubb: Ezreal was before Garen
[2:29:12] blubbubb: he mentioned that Ez mostly struggles vs tanks now, so they buffed him for that
[2:29:16] divin3cha0s: @Santorin look at bug fixes its insane
[2:29:20] blubbubb: and so people start using W more
[2:30:25] elzter_: poor auri

[2:31:06] Ammst4r: Did rumble get nerfed? @Santorin Not sure if tripping or you indeed said that
[2:31:12] blubbubb: wow, the Rito joke: "if they were spamming the flash key, F."
[2:31:42] TakingtheCake: You guys  heard about the Shaco clone upgrades?

[2:32:13] g1yph: Didn't want to take raptor up on offer sadge

[2:32:53] brightdiscord: NOPERS
[2:33:03] elzter_: ah true
[2:33:35] TakingtheCake: @elzter_ Shaco clone is getting updated so it copies his animations -visually harder to tell them apart.

[3:13:41] auri_sariel: his anti talent for the game is legendary

[3:19:35] Osami100: Just for fun
[3:19:59] auri_sariel: if theres bauss in the match, the question is never if he wins, but will he get banned after the match
[3:20:16] 0ki1721: you sound like Grant Cardone "10X 10X 10X" LUL
[3:20:28] opticdyno: shouldn't it be an E start?
[3:21:54] Silfel: Illaoi GIGACHAD
[3:22:02] auri_sariel: is that bauss quinn?
[3:22:50] spectreOO8: @santorin are you doing a fill to challeneger or just getting auto filled
[3:22:59] spectreOO8: seen you play top and mid no jungle
[3:22:59] auri_sariel: @spectreOO8 autofilled
[3:23:10] spectreOO8: @auri_sariel damn
[3:23:24] spectreOO8: thats a lot of auto fill for him today
[3:24:03] auri_sariel: why do they keep pinging u whole match XD
[3:25:47] Kithlan: How good is Udyr jungle versus top
[3:25:58] auri_sariel: @Kithlan its better top
[3:26:05] auri_sariel: much better
[3:26:46] auri_sariel: @Kithlan udyr falls off hard later in the match so if u play it jungle ure forced to do early plays or u just snowball to a loss
[3:28:09] jblol94: baus top ofc illaoi is winning lane phase
[3:29:58] Kithlan: @auri_sariel I see, thanks
[3:30:39] solidussovis: How much more does it tilt you that you are autofill? If you were jungle this would be free win
[3:32:41] foxy_grandpa9: kaypea is 5-0 with heartsteal lux mid... clearly you chose the wrong mid champ
[3:32:58] opticdyno: the Baus is freelo
[3:33:39] solidussovis: Trissect?
[3:36:02] solidussovis: trist and ez also scale well though so I think you got this
[3:37:43] solidussovis: I see. Its a team scaling thing. They will just delete you late game
[3:38:19] 0ki1721: time to become a demon @Santorin
[3:38:21] opticdyno: taking it before 20 was trolololo
[3:38:47] solidussovis: @opticdyno thats true. wait 10 sec and everyone gets it
[3:40:11] solidussovis: Sooo...... FF
[3:41:05] Silfel: Only now arriving at Baron danAware
[3:41:08] solidussovis: Not legal. Baron is for winners not your team
[3:41:52] getsometalentloser: these players need to be lined up against he wall
[3:41:54] getsometalentloser: in gane
[3:41:57] getsometalentloser: game
[3:42:05] Silfel: Concerned

[4:12:32] auri_sariel: that Ahri avoiding you like the plague
[4:12:49] DJ_Photik: What's that rengars score
[4:12:59] DJ_Photik: If u Lee, you will win.
[4:13:05] DJ_Photik: You op Lee ;)
[4:13:32] auri_sariel: you win against Ahri, you would have to perfectly mess up to lose to her
[4:13:44] DJ_Photik: Wait are you queuing for jg too been mid top this morning haha
[4:14:07] auri_sariel: no kill for u
[4:14:57] auri_sariel: Ahri is really week since this season started, shes not a  threat and wont ever be, shes there only to land a charm, no damage from her
[4:15:01] auri_sariel: weak*
[4:15:21] getsometalentloser: axiom
[4:15:31] getsometalentloser: else grudge
[4:16:24] auri_sariel: oof u jumped at the one target who has armor XD
[4:16:35] nap343: is Talon laing phase still rough ?
[4:17:02] auri_sariel: @lol_dynasty Talons laning phase is not really bad, depends on the matchup
[4:17:02] getsometalentloser: @lol_dynasty yeh]
[4:17:15] baevermaas: dude look how a ww just runs the server. Why dont you just copy? @Santorin
[4:17:16] getsometalentloser: but talons very much a macro style assasin
[4:17:32] getsometalentloser: making plays aorund the map
[4:18:34] getsometalentloser: @Santorin  use profane liek u would u auto reset
[4:18:57] DJ_Photik: Auto profane active, auto!
[4:18:59] DJ_Photik: ?
[4:19:03] DJ_Photik: @getsometalentloser
[4:19:21] baevermaas: dude look how a ww just runs the server. Why dont you just copy? @Santorin  Û†ÄÄ

[4:20:16] rinseandretreat: lee sin syndrome
[4:20:43] auri_sariel: Santorini the robin hood of summoners rift, takes from the rich, gives to the poor (Ahri in this case)
[4:22:04] lewhitehd69: Pog 4-3
[4:23:00] auri_sariel: to see u being filled mid lane nonstop is quite weird for sure, its the most played role
[4:24:24] auri_sariel: but it is true that mid lane player base has been steadily decreasing over last 3 seasons, mid lane soon might not be the most played role
[4:25:16] DemionDemon: why does your char look like Friday from Robinson Crusoe? XDD
[4:25:17] Zady: hold on - this isn't league of legends
[4:25:35] tugwos: New game mode
[4:25:43] Zady: Are you enjoying the game so far?
[4:25:45] tugwos: he's playing wukong

[4:26:59] Zady: what a cutie
[4:28:21] auri_sariel: OH DAMN u have Caliste on ur team? gg
[4:29:38] auri_sariel: Caliste signed with Karmine Corp already last season till 2026
[4:30:50] auri_sariel: yeah Caliste would be the starting adc for KC if not for the stupid age restriction rule
[4:31:43] TimeWizardLuL: did you try lethality lee?
[4:32:24] RaiohKyros: gg game over

[4:34:54] getsometalentloser: @photikx this the storm dragon one
[4:34:57] koushik_10: not gonna lie he played it bad then a iron player
[4:35:08] getsometalentloser: just that everyoine uses the myhtic chroma
[4:35:12] koushik_10: how can not land that hook

[4:36:34] auri_sariel: OMFG
[4:36:36] auri_sariel: AHAHAHHAA
[4:36:53] DJ_Photik: Have you tried tiamat first buy finish 2nd item first then finish tiamat item @santorin
[4:36:57] auri_sariel: Caliste must be tilted af KEKW
[4:36:59] lubemila: santorinFine
[4:37:20] dontcountonthewicked: i'm so glad the nonsense happens no matter what rank <3 LOL
[4:38:05] Yeyni14: Pyke - Alive indeed
[4:38:52] solidussovis: and way better then your supp. You all remember when supp main focus was to ward
[4:38:54] auri_sariel: that drag was kinda greedy since ur bot and mid lane both recalled
[4:38:54] TimeWizardLuL: cleaver or eclipse next?
[4:39:05] solidussovis: Now they want to roam and get kills to carry
[4:40:21] lubemila: kaypUpsetti
[4:40:40] auri_sariel: @Santorin the enemy team is in your mind rent free
[4:40:49] Furiusl: supp gap
[4:42:00] Virbello: i thought yone vs fiora was unplayable for yone lol
[4:42:51] auri_sariel: AND NOW HE COMES THERE LOL add insult to injury XD
[4:42:51] solidussovis: oh look Pyke is moving now so he can give up another kill
[4:42:58] aicorpse: you seem to enjoy this game :)
[4:43:02] dark_lion1992: :D
[4:43:13] lubemila: santorinW santorinSad
[4:43:15] KoS_Bunnyslippers: hi
[4:43:17] koushik_10: why did riot remove dms during champ select
[4:43:18] aicorpse: KEKW
[4:43:23] auri_sariel: this was such an unloseable match wtf happened XD
[4:43:23] koushik_10: anyone has a clue
[4:43:51] hillrammus: 2x scaling hp shards = 8 sec slower clear compared to 2x armor shards :(
[4:44:48] solidussovis: I bet Pyke is thinking how "clean" that dive was. Because he is bad
[4:45:32] gymleaderjusten: I really enjoy your streams but man you tilt yourself so much. negativity will impact your gameplay.
[4:45:45] solidussovis: everytime
[4:45:57] auri_sariel: that zyra lives rent free in Santorinis head
[4:46:15] miilub196: look like my 2 previews games :))
[4:46:17] solidussovis: @gymleaderjusten He is usually way positive bro. It has been a lot of troll games today and he is still pulling out wins
[4:46:26] brightdiscord: holy azir damage
[4:46:26] TorqueBandit: WE BACJ
[4:46:28] TorqueBandit: K
[4:48:01] auri_sariel: though the fact they got 2 for 2 i nthat top fight is kinda criminal, that should have been free
[4:48:20] DJ_Photik: When boots
[4:48:33] DJ_Photik: T2 boots timing is tough for me lol
[4:49:24] TorqueBandit: rekterino

[4:53:01] TorqueBandit: and again pyke, 1v3
[4:53:05] DJ_Photik: Tiamat into eclipse is what I've been doing. Heard the build your going is default vs bruiser or tankier teams. Haven't played that much Lee this season.
[4:53:23] DJ_Photik: Maybe a Nocturne game for an easy win @santorin
[4:54:14] TimeWizardLuL: hexplate
[4:54:20] auri_sariel: i dont think i have seen nocturne since 14.1B
[4:54:54] DJ_Photik: Winnable

[5:00:34] auri_sariel: this is a dodge
[5:00:36] Boh14: Do you think lillia pumps her arms when she runs?
[5:01:17] auri_sariel: your bot lane is about to lose so hard
[5:02:28] auri_sariel: your bot and top got so hard counterpicked
[5:02:37] DJ_Photik: Ooo Lilia
[5:02:38] bababooey_ff: @santorin are u married
[5:02:55] 1000andrej: wtf just noticed i'm a subscriber. how did this happen? i have never subscribed to anyone.
[5:03:06] DJ_Photik: I lost to a blitz yas bot lane feels bad man
[5:03:16] auri_sariel: @1000andrej click on notification, to the left of ur messages tab on top of twitch, it will show u who gifted it
[5:04:06] DemionDemon: honest and serious question. on a scale from 1 to Spica 9 man sleep, how good is your Lilia?
