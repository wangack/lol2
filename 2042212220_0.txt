[6:42:01] Centrolis: @jomvom i think with any esport playing in the highest rank is very different to playing pro, you need to balance playing safe with good scaling with good early plus late game. plus with games like league you need to play more versitile options, otp's arent the greatest for that imo

[6:45:05] Centrolis: @alleviatedlegend ahh must have not seen that game then. im just a low elo pleb but i think that navori is overall more rounded with the cdr it gives + dmg on non crits (could be wrong about the dmg part). plus in solar's item guide i think he mentioned ie isnt as good as just going navori
