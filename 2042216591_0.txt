[0:07:40] Jaketin8: The mmr system the reason for that @KatPanda your mains mmr is lower so it doesnt wanna let you climb, until your mmr goes up on it, it will just be like, no climbing allowed. Oh yeah, take loss it goes down, win 10 in row? Yeah it doesnt move back up

[0:10:32] Hattnissen: scaling health
[0:10:34] Arisutra: there's movespeed
[0:10:35] kremmalionwy: what's your favourite league skin ?
[0:10:38] J9D4: Move speed
[0:10:39] ancholy: Theres more than 3
[0:10:40] AllyWayz: oooo anvia game !!! hello kp <3
[0:10:44] syllariia: health scaling
[0:10:45] Arisutra: like, 2% movespeed i think
[0:11:04] Smoothcollie: @jeroenvijver wha- whyy? They wanna amplify the dmg or what?
[0:11:12] CrispyDiarrhea: prediction?
[0:11:18] Jaketin8: Wait anivia can get ultimate hunter? Wasnt that autoswitched off before?
[0:11:30] Arisutra: @Smoothcollie nah, it's so that there's less "oh i took mr into an armour matchup" stuff going on
[0:11:31] tmiklea: Hayy good luck on new patch <3
[0:11:32] Hattnissen: in the bottom it's flat health, tenacity, scaling health. In the middle adaptive, movement speed and scaling health
[0:11:39] Hattnissen: top row is unchanged
[0:11:47] jeroenvijver: @Smoothcollie lmao i have noo idea riot was feeling funny
[0:11:54] Arisutra: so now everyone gets health, so it's less coinflippy with flex picks
[0:12:02] hkgarey: Morning friends!! Happy Wednesday!!
[0:12:04] Soff199: Hello Kelsie! Hello chat! That hair looks AMAZING
[0:12:08] jeroenvijver: goodluck on the game KP <3
[0:12:10] Arisutra: they changed the two bottom rows
[0:12:18] Hattnissen: I was also surprised
[0:12:20] 038Misha: rank?
[0:12:40] Vladpopvv: omg what is that beautiful hair today?? I love it!
[0:12:41] Ktyli: Have you ever considering changing streaming platforms or tried any of the others like kick?
[0:12:42] Soff199: wait what changed? what did i miss?
[0:12:47] Arisutra: it's so you don't just auto-lose lane if there are two flex picks that switch lane and you guessed the wrong person
[0:12:51] Viivica: But hey, fantastic change: more items now show impact stats! Was so annoyed with not knowing (for example on imperial mandate and ardent censer)
[0:12:52] jeroenvijver: i love walling a vlad while hes in pool >:D
[0:12:53] Frozenfruit13: kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[0:13:03] Viivica: Was legit so bummed when I didn't know
[0:13:14] Hattnissen: I instantly thought, people are oneshotting every one from like minute 4, let's remove armor and mr from the runes kaypLOL
[0:13:25] kremmalionwy: Hello everyone !
[0:13:32] Smoothcollie: @arisutra That's tilting but that's completely your fault honestly. I get it when u don't know  cuz champ can go ap or ad. Rn in the game is too much dmg, removing it amplify the dmg too even bigger number
[0:13:33] Jaketin8: Judges extra hard Kappa
[0:13:43] jeroenvijver: omg kp is farming like her life depends on it :O
[0:14:05] Arisutra: @Smoothcollie yeah they said in the patch notes it's because of the presence of mages botlane

[0:16:03] Jaketin8: @Darkcyter kaypPengu kaypHello
[0:16:10] Smoothcollie: @arisutra Of the dmg? Nah. Not just bcs mages bot. Sure they are one of the reason, but not the only reason. Riot is once again showing they have 200+ collective year balancing experience kaypLUL Like don't get me wrong, I actually love the idea of the speed, but first fix the dmg, then make changes to armour/mr
[0:16:13] AllyCaatt: thank goodness for Kp entertainment while workingggg

[1:00:56] MissUnfortuneK: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:01:01] J_to_the_jf: grab that pink flower new item malignants takes away some of the MR they have as well as the new pink flower item gives shield and health
[1:01:02] rescued: staff of flowing water for utility or cryptbloom or liandries
[1:01:04] jzipfel20: thx!
[1:01:17] littlejellyfishy: @jzipfel20 Enchant her spells - R Q = big  Q plus zone that explodes - R W Chains heals and snares longer - R E = Shields stronger and in an area so if there are allies they get shielded too
[1:01:21] SquirrelMaster61985: i bet you could just go deathcap honestly
[1:01:23] GunzaPrime: Late Game Scaling‚Ñ¢
[1:01:32] Sunnytinker: would using W be better for defense or using it after akaili e's or would it not matter since she is so slippery
[1:01:47] Hattnissen: @jzipfel20 Only the first cast after ulting though

[1:02:58] Chris_Fury_Z: plus sup utility
[1:03:02] DevlinaOfDestiny: @Sunnytinker if you use it when she uses her W, you can see her for the duration of karma W which helps with dodging and damaging her
[1:03:07] SquirrelMaster61985: oh yeah cosmic drive would be fun
[1:03:13] Hattnissen: Hi Dark @Darkcyter kaypHello
[1:03:19] jundan: Is this a new skin?
[1:03:21] jeroenvijver: is cosmic drive still in the game? cuz that used to be good on her no?
[1:03:26] ellewoodss: staff/cosmic i think would be good for the support capabilities
[1:03:34] littlejellyfishy: @jundan Old skin it's traditional Karma c:
[1:03:41] J_to_the_jf: Cryptbloom is the item I was thinking of

[1:04:54] homantic: liandrys is good too
[1:05:13] J_to_the_jf: it'll also do more dmg to the minions
[1:05:17] DevlinaOfDestiny: @J_to_the_jf Karma W already naturally reveals
[1:05:22] YgorValadaress: helloo

[1:06:24] YgorValadaress: there's a lot of MR in there, magic en it will be nice
[1:06:31] DevlinaOfDestiny: cryptbloom only works if you kill someone
[1:06:32] YgorValadaress: magic pen*
[1:06:36] kristykat_: Dawncore?
[1:06:40] jeroenvijver: if i look up a build it says core items malignance and cosmic drive, and then cryptbloom into Dcap
[1:06:55] J_to_the_jf: ya you need vision and health and more magic pen to minions to get them out of your way horizon then crypto or crypto then horizon
[1:06:56] Hattnissen: Then it's probably cosmic drive
[1:07:05] sabiirox: sivir good this season?
[1:07:06] ArchitectMason: shhhh I‚Äôm watching you from work‚Ä¶
[1:07:07] xBoomShotBaby: Karma seems fun tho, might try her as well

[2:59:18] gerwinb29: His cards can crit now right?
[2:59:25] kellz30: Or is it the item
[2:59:27] Niomah: did anyone check to see if TF and Noc are duo? Noc ult just saved TF there
[2:59:28] lewhitehd69: lee might need to change his name xd
[2:59:31] 1meatsqueezer: depending on build, he can literaly, one blue card kill a mage
[2:59:34] gerwinb29: Like his W empowered ones

[3:00:03] aty212121: They feed
[3:00:09] FeedTheTank: FeedTheTank subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:00:17] kellz30: Bot lanes r gonna suck more cause this map lay out sucks
[3:00:30] danielsanwaxoff: based stats got nerged but his e q got buffed
[3:00:34] k0t10n: welcome to the kayMUNITY

[3:00:40] Niomah: At that point if you are gonna troll because I won't surrender, I'm making that game last as long as possible just to keep you from playing again

[3:02:17] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[3:02:27] FeedTheTank: tf was meta and fine for the first few weeks of the season, but now he is broken huh?
[3:02:39] danalia: @kaypea you look tired and sad :(
[3:02:51] FiveFM: Bard was super annoying... I think that means he was a good Bard player.
[3:02:57] Niomah: I mean in my case, when I hop into a game, it's likely the only one I can play that day because adulting sucks. So if 10 mins in people want to FF, it means I don't get to play at all that day
[3:03:17] Miaumiaaauuu: how did the karma game go i fell asleep kaypLurk

[3:05:05] RaynKire: RaynKire subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[3:05:07] FeedTheTank: people on league are just weak minded, and children thinking they know best :D
[3:05:08] EnigmaticYeenBean: people like that often think very me me me. No respect for the team part of the game.
[3:05:11] Niomah: There are people who give up in 5 minutes if they aren't already dookie-ing on the other team
[3:05:12] PrincessPix: is that an engagement ring? it looks so pretty ! if yes congrats
[3:05:15] Darkcyter: @VanillaEssenceLoL kaypHello
[3:05:19] SKEvolution: lets gooo KP!, gunna lurk a as im going into game.
[3:05:19] Darkcyter: @RaynKire WB
[3:05:23] heeyysteve: yeah but it obviously just feeds into the loss when you start that shit. I just dont underastand the logic
[3:05:29] k0t10n: kinda doomed Sadge
[3:05:42] ObsceneSanity: bard probably would‚Äôve punished your team for grouping
[3:05:44] eyaaa0: heyyy  how u doin today
[3:05:49] Niomah: Seriously, there have been teams down 2 kills and their ADC or Jungle is utterly tilted because they are 0-1 so they aren't hard carrying and they don't wanna play anymore
[3:06:04] lawfulevil_13: I think we might need a nail biting emote
[3:06:33] Niomah: I think the new emote should be a never surrender one (I dunno like a NO sign on top of a white flag?
[3:06:46] heeyysteve: the come back games are the most fun for me. Esp when the team pulls together and talks one another up. Its just so much more fun!
[3:06:49] EnigmaticYeenBean: they dont wanna put the effort in. They want a spotlight without earning it.
[3:06:54] Remixkoala: It's a strategy game really with flashy effects, and one idea can turn the whole fight around!
[3:06:56] jimbob_ywert: just made crepe with Nutella and banana, anyone want?
[3:07:07] Niomah: @jimbob_ywert yes plz
[3:07:11] Viivica: Even games are MORE fun... Where you wanna say GG WP and mean it.
[3:07:18] xquietdreamerx: People get tilted way to easily :/
[3:07:19] VanillaEssenceLoL: i will literally try until my last sec in ranked
[3:07:29] Gar116: It's a lot of ego
[3:07:33] inSINwetrust: I got a jungler afk because I got the first blood and they wanted it
[3:07:54] Gar116: "I got killed so this game is over cause I'm the main character"
[3:07:56] heeyysteve: LUL and people wonder why the world is going to shit
[3:07:59] juunioorrr: wow nice pick

[3:08:40] Viivica: Very true
[3:08:44] VanillaEssenceLoL: it has a lot to do with mindset you go into the game and league is hard it does take a mental tole sometimes
[3:08:54] k0t10n: minecraft better
[3:09:03] heeyysteve: I bet Kim Jong Un  ints Kappa
[3:09:09] guiltyprawn: kaypSpy Neeko Darius duo
[3:09:12] S17Master: There needs to be a case study on how happens inside the brain waves of League players
[3:09:21] S17Master: what* not how
[3:09:25] aty212121: xheioa dong
[3:09:35] xquietdreamerx: one play can change the whole game
[3:09:40] Terhadalas: this song is giving me mixed vibes
[3:09:47] FeedTheTank: first step to improve, is to acknowldge your mistake and trying to fix them, so maybe the person mindset should be included?
[3:09:50] Terhadalas: I don't know how I'm feeling
[3:09:54] Remixkoala: How did the karma game go btw? Left just as it started, hehe
[3:09:59] aty212121: And one can losem it
[3:10:06] thelmattador: Beware river shen
[3:10:25] Viivica: Also, you never know when enemies get a rq or just mess up giving you a window. I won 4v5 my second placement - my team did not even start an ff vote - bless them!
[3:10:26] soulshark: are u finding tank mid matchups?
[3:10:30] aty212121: You gotta be precise dude
[3:10:46] VanillaEssenceLoL: nexus to nexus are the most thrilling
[3:10:50] xquietdreamerx: I love come back games to, they really are the best and make it all worth it
