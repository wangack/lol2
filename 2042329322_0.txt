[0:05:03] SamsonOfSpite: Its easily got like 50+ hours of gameplay
[0:05:21] SamsonOfSpite: Yes
[0:05:24] Skyz_Ninjaz: yo
[0:05:27] SamsonOfSpite: Think of it like breath of the wild
[0:05:27] IICoconutII: not really
[0:05:28] jessthemess18: yeah
[0:05:33] Skyz_Ninjaz: I think its kinda casual
[0:05:34] SamsonOfSpite: Its very breath of the wild
[0:06:07] KlaviKyle: Gamefreak won't put out a good pokemon game, so someone else did
[0:06:13] SamsonOfSpite: ^^^^^^^
[0:06:27] ChaseShaco: god i would HATE if someone donated
[0:06:29] ChaseShaco: 27 dollats

[0:07:17] IICoconutII: pokemon with guns
[0:07:31] SamsonOfSpite: Its a melting pot of good game ideas/mechanics
[0:07:33] KlaviKyle: It's a survival game like Conan Exiles, but with pokemon
[0:07:38] ChaseShaco: but its actually
[0:07:41] SamsonOfSpite: Its basically rust + Pokemon + breath of the wild
[0:07:41] ChaseShaco: a decenyt game?
[0:07:45] Skyz_Ninjaz: There are several character models that are direct rip offs of some pokemon. Like so much so that a character designer said when they are making a new game they literally copy paste and make adjustments since it is so hard to get that close by hand.
[0:07:53] ChaseShaco: yeah thats smart
[0:07:56] ChaseShaco: people like pokemon
[0:07:58] Xenth1s: idk a lot of waiting to stuff to construct/eggs to hatch
[0:08:00] ChaseShaco: u shud copy them

[0:08:46] iam40g: you’ll be the only primeape
[0:08:46] whalechoker: no, xbox gamepass on pc as well as
[0:08:48] ChaseShaco: but it expires

[0:10:21] IICoconutII: but we cheap fucks like u

[0:10:29] KAPPE89: if u were a cute girl
[0:10:29] iam40g: I could see you country stepping
[0:10:29] Xenth1s: for gamepass
[0:10:32] whalechoker: im poor right now so can’t donate Sadge
[0:10:39] eyprobeckmann: so wait if you get the pass, get the game for 1 Dollar and then cancel the pass so you dont have to pay the subscription after 2 weeks you lose the game right ?
[0:10:46] iam40g: country stepping to those country girls
[0:10:49] iam40g: giving them a big binky
[0:10:52] Xenth1s: @eyprobeckmann yes after your pass expires you lose access
[0:11:08] eyprobeckmann: @Xenth1s yeah well so you get the game for 2 weeks
[0:11:10] Skyz_Ninjaz: @Xenth1s claimed. get rekt
[0:11:12] eyprobeckmann: thats not worth it

[0:12:05] Xenth1s: might try cities skyline
[0:12:28] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[0:12:28] eyprobeckmann: its not worth if i only play compettive games or soulslikes / monster hunter games
[0:12:37] false_monk: Omg youre online. Ive been waiting  since you went to get some pizza
[0:12:46] Xenth1s: yeah if you only care about select titles its bad
[0:12:59] Xenth1s: but id rather pay 10$ to play several games than buy them
[0:13:14] iam40g: not as racist as you
[0:13:20] iam40g: strong mental no tears
[0:13:24] Skyz_Ninjaz: dude, im kidding
[0:13:27] Skyz_Ninjaz: i didnt take it
[0:13:51] eyprobeckmann: yeah if you get like a few games a year out of it then its worth but like i wait for like 5 years for a game that interests me enough LUL
[0:13:54] KAPPE89: what videogames does your gf play? @ChaseShaco
[0:14:19] Skyz_Ninjaz: prolly wasnt the smartest thing to just send it in chat but
[0:14:19] Xenth1s: @eyprobeckmann just like gta5 for free on epic Kapp
[0:14:26] Xenth1s: Shruge
[0:14:53] Xenth1s: if u had discord nitro you should still have 1 and 3 month codes in gift inventory

[0:54:53] Jyeesh: In your yt guide (great guide) you said it doesn't matter for sudden impact vs cheapshot; does sudden impact lethality making seryldas even stronger change the scales?
