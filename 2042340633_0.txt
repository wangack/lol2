[1:59:30] RANGERZX: at what point did i say that camille beats tanks or ksante
[1:59:35] RANGERZX: true dmg is just objectively good
[1:59:38] RANGERZX: vs tanks
[1:59:42] kemia1987: ranger cluegi? @Drututt
[1:59:50] AlexGrahamBell: that is so huge
[2:00:12] RANGERZX: it was an obvious joke though
[2:00:14] lol_Xabi: well shes good against tanks with items but in lane she just has 0 dmg after they back once
[2:00:14] RANGERZX: to piss you and xabi off

[2:00:40] topwaffler69: has he got the new yasuo skin
[2:00:40] rappler420: @RANGERZX ngl dzukill smashed you on this debate
[2:00:41] AlexGrahamBell: xdd
[2:00:41] TheLandShark_: 3-1 games lookin good so far - well kinda good
[2:00:41] miufia: camille just dogshit in general doesnt matter tanks or bruiser
[2:00:44] Toba6: @Dzukill i like how rito just let champs die cuz they are too lazy to balance them, like when camel came out she was rly a tank killer, same with gwen 50% true dmg on q NICE RITO
[2:00:47] RANGERZX: camille players will just somehow make camille sound weak even when she is almost always good winrate
[2:00:52] RANGERZX: in s14 she did become weaker thats why she got buffed
[2:00:52] prefelx: let the man stream in peace <3
[2:00:57] TheLandShark_: @miufia watch dzu carry with it rn tho
[2:01:18] SpeakX77: ranger could hold hands with phreak and talk about winrate xdd
[2:01:21] Toba6: @RANGERZX but she lost her identity
[2:01:26] slayy_yy: Are you not playing malphite? I thought you were a malphite main?
[2:01:31] futuristicmango1: Her scaling is good and late game champs are meta
[2:01:33] RANGERZX: yeah, and thats deserved, this champ has absolutely unhinged scaling
[2:01:40] Toba6: @RANGERZX like for what do you pick camel now?
[2:01:41] Nimlaya: lastGarf
[2:01:42] LostFromSorrow: @slayy_yy hes going easy on them

[2:02:19] mars010803: Her lane used to be to just scale till divine
[2:02:26] RANGERZX: when i talk about camille i am simply arguing against the narrative from camille players that this champ is somehow terrible at all times
[2:02:27] RANGERZX: makes 0 sense
[2:02:31] lol_Xabi: I just miss the times where she was op and actually good in lane cuz shes one of the coolest toplane champs with the most potential
[2:02:37] RANGERZX: LULE
[2:02:47] sumdumfrak: i always wanted to try camel now s14 fucked her
[2:02:58] LostFromSorrow: camel where are you camel
[2:03:02] Daddydarshan: when do you go ms rune
[2:03:03] Toba6: @RANGERZX i memer as w would heal on minions aswell such a good days
[2:03:07] IronTimm: this shit triforce just needs a buff
[2:03:12] bwardak: with sunderer gone she actually takes skill now
[2:03:20] RANGERZX: triforce needs a small buff for sure
[2:03:22] RANGERZX: but just a rly small one
[2:03:22] sumdumfrak: truuu buff trifors actually
[2:03:34] lol_Xabi: @RANGERZX is it weak? doesent feel weak to me
[2:03:35] futuristicmango1: sunderer camille q did unholy amounts of dmg
[2:03:37] foo_999: bringe back the divine surend
[2:03:41] IronTimm: it feels so bad to buy compared to what other items give you
[2:03:48] IronTimm: also in the build path

[2:04:17] TheLandShark_: let him get shojin
[2:04:20] TheLandShark_: then 3 es
[2:04:24] RANGERZX: so i think triforce still feels good, coz it kinda is coz so many users for it
[2:04:36] Kino3x: @RANGERZX doesnt mean tri isnt shit
[2:04:38] RANGERZX: but it should be a tiny bit better
[2:04:43] foo_999: @LostFromSorrow actually only that item for counter the ksante i think
[2:05:07] RANGERZX: not only melee champs use triforce btw
[2:05:13] lol_Xabi: @RANGERZX I wouldnt mind, but its a 126% gold efficient item with a great sheen and ms doesent seem bad in my experience with it
[2:05:14] kemia1987: @Drututt did new ravenous meet your expectations? i remember u were excited about it months before
[2:05:14] RANGERZX: its for sure weaker on ranged
[2:05:24] senkroh: the extra 100 gold that they added to frozen heart has to be a joke
