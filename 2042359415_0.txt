[1:37:19] LanternKnight: yeah you and junk are just cracked at lovers
[1:37:30] berrypudding08: I'd never even consider shooting someone for keys since faking them is a meta
[1:37:35] inktwich71: you definitely got your video for yt
[1:38:22] bluepurplered1k: What is amnesiac?
[1:38:29] bluepurplered1k: there is no description in the guide

[1:38:35] kkHarvy: @lanternknight beside the 3 seconds one..
[1:39:16] Kitaru: @bluepurplered1k has no role, has to "remember" one from a dead body in order to get a win condition
[1:39:16] flim318: @bluepurplered1k you can steal the role of a dead body
[1:39:19] yikesitsblank: just bad luck that aipha hasnt seen people sometimes autopilot walk to keys
[1:39:23] 15fine: @bluepurplered1k when they find a dead body, they can "remember" who they are (take the role of the dead player)
[1:39:37] yukikyokira: Do you think Court knows Aipha is Sheriff?

[2:31:27] Halofan642: horizon is really good, cosmic is nice, you can go any of the support items
[2:31:35] neon_toxin_: wouldn’t you want a mana item second for how many abilities are gonna get used?
[2:31:46] Halofan642: in order of what i think is best of support items is like, staff of flowing water, mandate, moonstone, ardent
[2:31:52] Halofan642: @neon_toxin_ malignance is a mana item
[2:31:53] Halofan642: and she has manaflow
[2:31:54] FrozenLavaReflector: also malignance is a lost chapter item

[2:36:11] minismile_: 5up you might need a title change
[2:36:16] minismile_: idk what to put im not creative
[2:36:22] neon_toxin_: if you see the tiny little number in the top right corner of his ability icons that’s how much mana is needed for that ability
[2:36:27] PoteetLee: I was going to make super funny one...but decided against it.
[2:36:31] mlemfloofs: leg. perfect title

[2:37:03] minismile_: thats true also
[2:37:12] inktwich71: @yikesitsblank each ability needs a certain amount of mana to be used, like trying to buy something with money, or energy to run

[2:41:49] Aipha: @berrypudding08 its ok peepoGiggles
[2:41:54] coolwaveofcalm: @yikesitsblank those are skill points that you put into your abilities to make them stronger as you level up
[2:42:03] xthe_spacemanx: so you start with no abilities and each level you can upgrade one of them.
[2:42:05] neon_toxin_: @yikesitsblank so you can level up abilities as you level up and the dots are how many times he has leveled them up. so his q is max level and will be his strongest ability because of it

[3:08:02] flowtives: bro me u and ant gotta run it
[3:08:06] cameron416: q is the skillshot, w is a chain that can root enemy, e is the shield that speeds him up
[3:08:07] flowtives: i promise you itll be fun as fuck
[3:08:08] LanternKnight: i don't play league but this just seems like dodgeball 2.0 to me haha
[3:08:10] vDaishar: Ultimate ability you get a level 6 that has bigger impact
[3:08:30] flowtives: but its fine
[3:08:32] flowtives: *fun
[3:08:34] cameron416: if he uses ult (r button) the next ability gets upgraded
[3:08:37] blazin_barbie: @lanternknight lmao practically
[3:08:40] flowtives: if you ever wanna try it just hit me up im in that uhc lovers discord
[3:08:47] EmmatheRedPanda: @vDaishar ohh thank you!
[3:08:49] vDaishar: Q is the damage skill shot, w is a tether/leash, e is a shield
[3:08:51] flowtives: @Antfrost Ur butt kid
[3:08:59] EmmatheRedPanda: @cameron416 thank you!
[3:09:02] cameron416: q does more dmg and has an aoe, w will heal him, and e will shield everyone nearby instead of jsut one person
[3:09:08] EmmatheRedPanda: thanks guyss
[3:10:02] flowtives: ok anyways i have no idea how to play league so enjoy ur stream my g
[3:10:06] flowtives: good luck with games
[3:10:16] vDaishar: Npnp. I stopped playing league years ago but I still remember quite a bit of it
[3:10:46] XortedI: charm too
[3:11:11] cameron416: karma has the possible tanky route that sera doesnt, but yeah
[3:11:17] coolwaveofcalm: Seraphine did all of the void grubs herself???????
[3:11:22] tim_dice: a karma couldnt mid lane which says something also
[3:11:30] jonathon_irl: yeah but with seraphine I get spam pinged if I miss my ult
[3:12:00] the_Azakana: Yeah but sera is designed as a midlaner and karma is designed as support
[3:12:22] Drude27: I stopped playing around her release so I dont know her kit well but does her speed up effect entire team?
[3:12:45] Meyra95: not sure about better version... It is more fun to play with karma
[3:13:59] FrozenLavaReflector: karma has landable poke unlike seraphine
[3:14:17] tim_dice: and she can do good dmg consistently where seras Q is mainly for lower health ig
[3:15:17] the_Azakana: Karma isn't supposed to waveclear reliably without an adc early to mid game
[3:15:27] FrozenLavaReflector: sera q is one of the most unreliable spells in the game
[3:15:34] Fossabot: @berrypudding08, Please ask for permission to post a link. [warning]
[3:16:04] berrypudding08: It seems u are running circles around her
[3:16:20] cameron416: they just dicked on jesus
[3:16:28] tim_dice: Sera works to help carry the team and Karma lets a specific character carry?

[4:12:54] Anonymous0726: that seems potentially quotable
[4:13:08] Karakadon: flash to get back to lane faster

[4:13:29] xthe_spacemanx: I just now am realizing that your friend on the other team said “we both low lol” after you STRUGGLED to get back to masters lol
[4:13:36] taytayabby: I yoinked it out of one of your playlists

[4:17:11] snipeshow06: @yikesitsblank way less xp and youd be splitting too much gold.  YHoud get outscaled in an instant lol
[4:17:13] Anonymous0726: silence first tbh

[4:17:58] Anonymous0726: i would think so too
[4:18:03] yikesitsblank: @snipeshow06 splitting gold? outscaled?
[4:19:26] cameron416: you get exp from monsters and enemies dying
[4:19:36] Anonymous0726: to beeg
[4:19:36] pureiinsanity: how much MS is the MS shard giving you?
[4:19:40] Anonymous0726: to fit between towers
[4:19:44] snipeshow06: @yikesitsblank so theres 3 main forms of gaining gold and XP the 3 enemy minions that spawn into the 3 lanes and the jungle neutral camps.  So if you all go into 1 lane you are splitting all the gold and xp resources from only one lane rather then using the other 3 options of gaining
[4:19:44] cameron416: the exp will be split up by how many ppl are around, so you wont be leveling up as fast as the other team
[4:19:49] FrozenLavaReflector: 2%
[4:19:49] Anonymous0726: *too beeg
[4:19:50] pureiinsanity: 8lol
[4:20:07] Anonymous0726: actually somewhat substantial
[4:20:11] xthe_spacemanx: golf and xp is shared amongst all people participating in combat or nearby. if the whole team is in mid lane, then the enemy top and bottom laners will get way more xp and our scale your team
[4:21:06] Karakadon: golf? i love golfing
[4:21:11] Anonymous0726: Btw @5up do you know the hold ult level up trick?

[7:11:03] kidvoet: whats wrong with brolicious 😭
[7:11:10] Zianni: its 10x more effective vs draven players
[7:11:18] Zianni: because they will intentionally overfight and run it down a lane
[7:11:20] Zianni: KEKW
[7:11:51] Zianni: its just typical preseason matchmaking Kappa
[7:12:45] Zianni: its bad until around 600 LP

[7:12:55] Fossabot: 5up.
[7:12:57] Zianni: Yeah
[7:13:06] Zianni: Its because 0 - 600 LP is like inflated D1 players who dont know their roles
[7:13:13] Zianni: but there isnt enough players to keep them down
[7:13:16] blazin_barbie: I’m back how we doing

[7:23:25] lovecity: or lux please blow ur load
[7:23:29] lovecity: i didnt mean that.
[7:23:40] NutellaHS: heh
[7:23:46] z_palindrome: hi love lmao
[7:24:52] lovecity: 5up do u prio baron camps over drag? or vice versa? cause idk which i should be more concerned about
[7:25:23] lovecity: PepoG
[7:25:49] lavfully: did void grubs replace shelly?
[7:25:54] Zianni: @lovecity Soul is a win condition that teams can actively play through
[7:26:19] Zianni: If your team is actively winning, you will often do certain objectives as "Exit" plays
[7:26:20] lovecity: @Zianni PepoG so prio things that wont come back
[7:26:23] Zianni: Where you take things on the way out
[7:26:42] Zianni: So if my team is 5K gold up, we can just take the buff and then do drake if they're at the same time
[7:26:52] Zianni: But if we're equal in gold
[7:27:04] Zianni: Positioning becomes more valuable because whoever "controls" the objective has more gameplay opportunities
[7:27:12] Zianni: We call that "Taking" or "Retaking"
[7:27:30] Zianni: Forcing you to face check an objective or play wards to get vision gives me chances to one shot you on the way to drake
[7:27:33] Zianni: Things like that
[7:27:40] lovecity: KJUNIHWFRKJG

[7:28:58] lovecity: like i always remember old old old league was like ur get towers over drag because towers dont come back where as dragon always did? so in a scenario ur picking between drag and grubs, u choose grubs cause those dont respawn? kinda thing idk
[7:29:04] Zianni: I remember when you were 10/3, this is a very unlucky game
[7:29:08] renziboss: just three ults nothings crazy
[7:29:28] Zianni: @lovecity Drakes back then were just gold + xp
[7:29:34] lovecity: yeah ^
[7:29:40] Zianni: Dragons now have permanent buffs + scaling potential through soul or elder
[7:30:23] NutellaHS: om
[7:30:29] lovecity: ornn won that idgaf challenge
[7:30:34] NutellaHS: skill issue
[7:30:42] Zianni: If your team's win condition is through snowballing or aggressive gameplay, you can use void grubs as a way to force a fight or get free siege potential
[7:30:46] ducktominh: Sell it its a scam
[7:31:18] lovecity: damage? KEKW

[7:43:12] cameron416: to do 35k
[7:43:30] renziboss: needed like a draven or something to kill those tanks
[7:43:53] the_Azakana: how this went on for 43 mins is beyond me
[7:44:01] cameron416: bro was almost full tank and outdamaged lux how sad for u
[7:44:10] maverickx29: what do u do? get the lux to play a point and click character cause they couldn't hit anything
[7:44:12] cameron416: i wish i had arrived sooner
[7:44:34] renziboss: lol
[7:44:38] Enma_o: now I wanna play some bard myself, seems quite overpowered
[7:45:06] cameron416: bard is pretty solid rn partially just thanks to frozen heart
[7:45:46] Enma_o: rookern is also a fair item, and bloodsong seems good on him as well
[7:47:11] the_Azakana: the team was too short ranged considering lux hit a negative number of abilities

[8:39:10] thekatherine: ^
[8:39:22] Hayase64: I never heard a streamer said that, maybe it's a bot in chat
[8:39:30] maverickx29: some will do it a lot and its meh but once or twice, espicially like, after a pop off or something
[8:39:43] digi_tally: I follow when a streamer doesn't get on my nerves so I have some variety when choosing who to watch idk about others

[10:04:34] FrozenLavaReflector: trhe champion who cant get health
[10:04:36] jammanOC: physically impossible to build hp
[10:05:02] jammanOC: read pyke passive
[10:05:14] VengfulDark: Frozen heart has felt correct on a lot of mages as well. the cheapest 20% cdr out there with a ton of survivability
[10:05:19] FrozenLavaReflector: its why frozen heart is the tank item for you... no health on it
[10:07:22] jammanOC: 2nd paragraph on passive btw
[10:07:50] VengfulDark: I think he knows, but was just saying survivability in general
[10:08:16] jammanOC: dead mans would be another option
[10:08:30] jammanOC: get a lil bit extra speed
[10:08:44] VengfulDark: dead mans is really pricy on support

[10:15:58] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[10:16:21] zuflw: probably xerath players cause theres no way they are aiming some of those screenshots
[10:16:33] zuflw: skillshots
[10:17:24] VengfulDark: I've zoomed in a little bit when playing melee tanks.
[10:17:40] VengfulDark: but I've never played zoomed in a lot.
[10:17:47] wardenwithendermanhead: Hi guys
[10:17:52] VengfulDark: Oh except to click on a thresh lantern
[10:18:35] jammanOC: wait why?

[10:18:44] jammanOC: dont you just click on it
[10:18:49] 9fierce9: Why thresh?
[10:19:10] VengfulDark: because the enemy will body block the lantern and place wards on top of it.
[10:19:11] zuflw: yeah just click it?
[10:19:22] zuflw: oh
[10:20:32] JickyJack: GLASCING SO HARD RN
[10:21:09] jammanOC: speaking of overtuned.. what about the enemy adc?

[10:28:39] renziboss: red jayce

[10:29:25] jammanOC: i guess
[10:29:41] jammanOC: i guess i just come across more jayce players
[10:30:45] Nilosaurus_Rex: She does have good scaling on E

[10:53:54] Jotanve_: wait
[10:54:49] Jotanve_: Cryptbloom its the name
[10:54:53] Jotanve_: Passive - Life From Death: Whenever you get a takedown on an enemy champion within 3 seconds of damaging them, create a healing nova on their location that heals allies for 50 (+50% AP). 60-second cooldown.
[10:55:19] neon_toxin_: @Jotanve_ cooldown makes it a meh item
[10:56:07] VengfulDark: the 15% cdr makes up for the 10% m pen difference. if they don't have tanks
[10:58:22] voidxit: hurts us too
