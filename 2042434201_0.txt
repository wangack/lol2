[1:39:12] HatedByLifeItself: The term "twink" is often used in the LGBTQ+ community, particularly in gay culture, to describe a certain body type or appearance. A twink typically refers to a young, slim, often hairless or lightly built man, who may have a youthful and somewhat androgynous look. It's important to note that the term is somewhat subjective and may be used differently by different individuals.
