[0:48:49] Lichyness: oh my
[0:48:52] Frescote: I think we all have iissues when we play our mains we are a lot more strict about how the game should go and it affects our mentals. Its not that MF is better, you just tilt easier on Jhin because of higher expectations @IKeepItTaco

[0:52:08] akirafudo0655: for more agressive play and scale?
[0:52:12] Creccio: @akirafudo0655 DH deals a metric ton of damage later on
[0:52:34] tye_bo: no he hooked above jhin
[0:52:44] tye_bo: just like that XD
[0:52:46] khaida_: default skin blitz is scary
[0:52:58] akirafudo0655: @Creccio Is it good in low elo? Do you think there are too many maniacs trying to gank?
[0:53:02] akirafudo0655: can be good?
[0:53:26] Texxin: he is a spectator
[0:53:29] NapNapoleon: And then jax just leaves.
[0:53:52] Creccio: @akirafudo0655 it is good yea, lethality and ability spam is very strong. At 6 if you do a few trades and R at the end its usually a kill
[0:53:57] khaida_: i mean, its winnable still, aurelio carry
[0:53:58] NapNapoleon: Holy shit, Asol outplayed her hard

[1:07:59] IJohNGR: trust me most of the time they know, they see, but they want to blame it on someone so .. you know how stupid people are @IKeepItTaco
[1:08:15] malikhulia13: Chatting report Rakan Jhin
[1:08:20] A3roFury: blitz jinx duo was decent though ngl
[1:08:31] lener311: @a3rofury its a great synergy
[1:08:36] Greaterfiend00: gotta vet your lane mates as well it seems
[1:08:38] malikhulia13: kinda looked like he was autofillled
[1:08:44] lener311: I love bc and nauti as a sup
[1:08:55] Noeliosis: Hellowo
[1:08:57] FeelsGoodStream: pick an adc where you can have skill expression? *smacks hand* you better pick MF and like it next time
[1:09:00] zaitsev110: when pick mf over jhin ?
[1:09:00] brokenwolf59: Are you gonna try out Smolder when he comes out @ikeepittaco
[1:09:01] SuaveADC: your support determines if its a won lane or not, cant help if your support is a turbo inter with no brain
[1:09:02] A3roFury: gonna grab me a beer to ease your pain
[1:09:13] valo_ren: More Anomaly Agent today?
[1:09:28] Greaterfiend00: That's my thing if you are a riven one trick choose an easier support that just brings value
[1:09:44] Noeliosis: smolder looks fun
[1:09:51] valo_ren: You can beat up Olaf again
[1:09:53] valo_ren: yay
[1:10:25] lener311: jinx was sooo fed
[1:10:27] jillcaps17: did u just feel like playing jhin that game?
[1:10:27] lener311: hooooly
[1:10:35] Lunedi: Sounds like a huge skill issue, man
[1:10:47] Lunedi: Making such a mistake early
[1:10:56] lener311: me as a jinx otp
[1:10:59] jillcaps17: blits is toughhhhh
[1:11:02] lener311: i permaban jhin
[1:11:20] Greaterfiend00: well blitz forces your support to be on his a game else you just lose all pressure
[1:11:23] lener311: oh no
[1:11:27] lener311: shaco sup
[1:11:29] lener311: xdddd
[1:11:33] jillcaps17: yeah or when he waited for tower to fall to ult in XDDDDD
[1:11:37] IJohNGR: @lener311 jinx losses early only vs jhin right
[1:11:40] Mohinder1992: so annoying to play with scared adc or supp
[1:11:45] lener311: @IJohNGR yes
[1:12:08] lener311: and a fed jhin wins the late also
[1:12:10] Greaterfiend00: @jillcaps17 Yeah idk how he's a Riven main with execution that horrible
[1:12:24] IJohNGR: @lener311 never if they are both near tho, am i right :)
[1:12:29] lener311: @IJohNGR aah im sorry, didn't see the early
[1:12:39] NapNapoleon: Jhin jhin jhin jhin
[1:12:58] SuaveADC: ya atleast he can box the lane especially for ganks
[1:13:09] IJohNGR: @lener311 ye, and late , if they are both near, jinx wins 100%
[1:13:10] NapNapoleon: Hell yeah
[1:13:13] osamadad: why is nasus in adc
[1:13:17] IJohNGR: @lener311 only way jhin wins late,  w / r  ;)
[1:13:20] lener311: @IJohNGR na idk

[1:13:44] NapNapoleon: How 'bout using the ms thingy? Juuuuuuuust a try Juuuuuuust a bit
[1:13:55] malikhulia13: bro if it's pinkward they'll shaft em
[1:14:00] bubba5681: I understand the privacy setting so that people don't dodge games when they see certain players but can they at least add a tag to show you if that player is autofilled. It might make more dodges higher up but at least you can see and draft based around that your jg or sup is autofilled
[1:14:11] malikhulia13: I mean I hope
[1:14:12] IJohNGR: is it really pinkward
[1:14:19] NapNapoleon: Well, that's a good matchup right? Jinx and bard.

[1:22:37] lener311: unlucky
[1:22:44] TheKottel: Someone did te math, 3 voidgrubs is 14% increase in tower taking speed, while 6 is about 32%
[1:22:54] Navaurum: @midknightcc Can't disagree with that
[1:23:00] TheKottel: ALSO, if you buy ap elixir, void grubs also apply it
[1:23:01] Noeliosis: ekko SeemsGood
[1:23:11] crassletter: ive had some absolute animals as suppoers this months
[1:23:36] IJohNGR: @TheKottel if your laners are behind, 36% dmg = 0 cuz you will not be  able to push it
[1:24:20] midknightcc: @crassletter I haven't even started playing yet, the universe must have known I'd go mental lol

[1:29:32] zipztah: LUL NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:29:34] Silvah: wdym?
[1:29:41] SirAdayr: playing against tank karmas just make me cry
[1:29:41] Silvah: blame riot
[1:29:42] Junglebear1: NotLikeThis

[1:29:48] MimiBonnyBun: Zoe'd
[1:29:54] Creccio: @Silvah he went maligma into cosmic and fill from there and it was kinda nasty with ultimate hunter
[1:29:54] SirAdayr: i just had a sion ult down our base every time off cd with or without wave and end
[1:29:58] TheKottel: killed her chat? what has her chat done to you
[1:30:09] Silvah: @Creccio a cdr heavy build huh? NOTED
[1:30:24] Mr_Yeetmieser: shouldnt support shaco be ap?
[1:30:25] Creccio: maligma gives ult cdr specifically
[1:30:28] midknightcc: AD TF fundamentally is good, can't buy mercs into him cuz he's AA you to death anyway and tabi means you're stunned for longer and still AA to death
[1:30:29] Creccio: evey q was mantra
[1:30:30] s1mbo_: serpent game ?
[1:30:33] Silvah: well ye
[1:30:36] Silvah: but cosmic also gives cdr
[1:30:41] Silvah: and ult hunter gives ult cdr
[1:30:54] Creccio: yea, you get what i mean haah
[1:31:23] thisnameisbadasggg: damn your such a victim this game thats adc sadly
[1:31:33] Silvah: and mantra goes down in cd
[1:31:35] Silvah: if you hit people

[1:32:50] BootyPlonk: any ideas on how to improve in using cleanse? I'm someone who's really bad at timing it and try to avoid using it at all cost
[1:33:34] Creccio: @BootyPlonk try to predict the cc... TF with godl card? you are getting stunned. Leona walking at your weird? better be ready
[1:33:35] Silvah: cleanse after you see a white cc bar on your character
[1:33:45] Silvah: at first
[1:33:53] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[1:34:07] thisnameisbadasggg: @BootyPlonk try to anticipate things and just play you will get a better feel for it imo
[1:34:10] BootyPlonk: @Creccio yes but these situations are obvious of course but what if im vs lets say multiple cc at the same time
[1:34:22] BootyPlonk: and they try to bait it out etc
[1:34:29] BootyPlonk: i always either cleanse too late or too early
[1:34:33] NapNapoleon: THE TRAP SLOWED HIM AND MADE HIM FAIL FLASH
[1:34:35] Silvah: depends on the situation
[1:34:37] NapNapoleon: The god taco
[1:34:41] asol_lover: did bard just falsh ur trap?
[1:34:42] BootyPlonk: can't figure out how to get the timing correct
[1:34:45] asol_lover: i swear h did
[1:34:47] Creccio: @BootyPlonk try to not be in range of multiple cc at the same time
[1:34:52] Creccio: like, some times you cant avoid it
[1:35:09] Creccio: but if you are in range of 3 cc champs like that you are probs boned anyway
[1:35:13] ahmed_mahmoud191: do you follow football taco?
[1:35:20] Silvah: if you have flash
[1:35:25] Silvah: you probs should cleanse the first one
[1:35:29] Silvah: and try to flash to safety
[1:35:38] Silvah: also if they have a lot of cc tht you need to cleanse
[1:35:41] Silvah: you can take qss
[1:35:56] Creccio: @Silvah also have a millio with mikaels
[1:36:02] Silvah: lol
[1:36:04] Silvah: thats so overkill
[1:36:35] Creccio: a fat fiora can win games
[1:36:38] Creccio: this is not bad at all
[1:36:48] Silvah: Chatting toplane looking weak
[1:36:50] BootyPlonk: i guess so
[1:37:12] Creccio: @Silvah morgana jungle too
[1:37:16] SirAdayr: very bad for you to have mortal right? but rest of team wont get?
[1:37:38] unlimitedovercoat: do you always buy mortal reminder versus ivern or is it more irelia this game?
[1:37:43] Silvah: is morg jungle still a thing?
[1:37:56] OrianaLand: @Silvah not anymore
[1:37:56] Creccio: im not sure, this is some weird thought experiment
[1:38:16] SirAdayr: makes sense. usually i avoid getting mortal and just get exe
[1:38:20] SirAdayr: more worth to finish mortal?
[1:38:38] Silvah: I havent build antiheal in forever tbh
[1:38:56] BootyPlonk: LMAO the bard

[1:44:59] ahmed_mahmoud191: do you follow football taco?
[1:45:01] brahim20720: play mf
[1:45:09] crassletter: you have to flip heads 4 times just for a normal game it hurts so much
[1:45:15] NapNapoleon: You would have been fucked either way mf or jhin here
[1:45:48] ThatOneShotBruh: disable minimap cover?
[1:46:08] ThatOneShotBruh: also, Shaco support is totally not a troll pick Clueless
[1:46:53] Mohinder1992: 1 go in 1 back classic
[1:47:01] joshcow: then he spam pings you
[1:47:31] joshcow: what are some others that can lane alone?
[1:47:33] karldelon: maybe try one game on ez or mf
[1:47:45] Veyren: How is Samira in high elo?

[1:48:01] ThatOneShotBruh: Malphite? DogeKEK
[1:48:03] Noeliosis: one shotting with W
[1:48:04] LatHund: Why is garen in the adc category LULW
[1:48:26] Austxo_: Cait has E and range
[1:48:35] khaida_: whaaaat
[1:48:42] khaida_: and what is nasus doing there
[1:48:47] Austxo_: and traps lol

[1:49:03] joshcow: trist w?
[1:49:14] ThatOneShotBruh: @Nathanaell nah, she is outranged by basically everyone
[1:49:16] Austxo_: same with exreal
[1:49:21] Austxo_: e then lmao they almost the same range.
[1:49:22] nausikha_lotus: only MF this season?
[1:49:33] Creccio: @IKeepItTaco Saber has said multiple times that Cait without E isnt a champion
[1:49:33] TheFoxMaister: Jebus MF has many skins lol
[1:49:40] TheKottel: you can only cancel tristana with knock ups, no?
[1:49:44] Xalrentaru: I've been finding strange success with Asol bot when I have a supp who I know wont be doing anything. I just farm for 30min then 1v5, it feels like what Riot WANTED ADC's to do but y'know, pro play.
[1:49:49] LatHund: @TheFoxMaister Its a tiddy diff
[1:49:52] karldelon: this matchup is messed up
[1:49:55] Nightbot: Check out Anomaly Agent here! One of the most wishlisted games on steam! https://lurk.ly/9Y7rnj
[1:50:07] TheFoxMaister: @lathund that is so very true
[1:50:10] Austxo_: he uses more mana tho lol.
[1:50:18] Austxo_: so his range is smaller if you have no mana for Q
[1:50:21] oldskateboard: sona name lol
[1:50:41] TheKottel: how in the world are you without mana on Ezreal
[1:50:42] silnoa971: Being a jhin player he can towerdive LOL
[1:50:42] TheFoxMaister: Also how do you deal with Nilah, like as Jhin, I always lose to her somehow
[1:50:45] Xalrentaru: I pick Jhin when I get an engage or poke, and Asol with afk-chanters. Been having a good time.
[1:51:04] silnoa971: You funny taco
[1:52:03] Austxo_: you can say the same about ezreal then lmao, use your E and you no longer a champ.
[1:52:08] silnoa971: Maybe use the trap no taco ?
[1:52:16] Austxo_: his Q tickles compare to caits headshots passive
[1:52:36] Noeliosis: zoe supp? hmm
[1:52:39] nausikha_lotus: ie hs only playing mf this season
[1:52:42] Austxo_: his Q may be longer rqange. but cait has longer range in general plus builds RFC
[1:52:43] nausikha_lotus: is he'
[1:52:55] Xalrentaru: @nausikha_lotus when he gets afk-chanters, yes
[1:53:20] nausikha_lotus: enchanteurs are strong whats wrong with laning with them @Xalrentaru
[1:53:24] Austxo_: i mean i havent had much iossues with cait and im sitting at emerald 2, anytime i use ezreal he be tickling
[1:53:27] lener311: today I had an sion sup... I was like:?????
[1:53:43] Austxo_: i play cait, jihn and mf
[1:53:47] ThatOneShotBruh: @nausikha_lotus they have to actually know how to play to be useful
[1:53:52] Xalrentaru: @nausikha_lotus the players, mainly. A good enchanter is a treasure. But unfortunately 80% of them sit behind the adc and wait for mid game and/or roam.
[1:54:06] Austxo_: so why dont you play ezreal?
[1:54:14] lemontyani: i think the main point is that cait isn't bad champ ez just better survivour
[1:54:21] ThatOneShotBruh: @Austxo_ he does usually
[1:54:21] LeechuKun: i wonder if they're ever gonna update MF's lines to remove her mentioning the summoner, that part of the plot hasn't been a thing since forever
[1:54:29] nausikha_lotus: I am low elo so i would have assumed enchanteurs in higher ranks are usually really good ikeepitLUCY
[1:54:36] Xalrentaru: I like Ez AND Cait, both are good rooSit
[1:54:44] Noeliosis: pugPls
[1:54:49] jeuzee: !dh
[1:54:49] Xalrentaru: @nausikha_lotus you'd think that, but dont ask why they have an 80% winrate on Renga-

[1:55:31] joshcow: 1 of 3 deaths you predicted
[1:55:39] lener311: sona is a horrible sup
[1:55:47] lener311: in general
[1:56:01] malikhulia13: can you show runes when you get time ?
[1:56:15] th4tguy89: your supoprt dies once and that means it's game over for Jhin? wtf am i hearing

[1:57:02] vampeachie: vampeachie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[1:57:16] Austxo_: guess you should have went ezreal to farm safer and E away lol

[1:57:30] skybobbles: sona and mf is an interesting combo 🥲
[1:57:50] NapNapoleon: I mean, K'sante fucked that up royally.
[1:57:52] oldskateboard: who tf roams on sona
[1:58:07] cogstopper: Sorry bro I think I casted a spell of bad supports instead of good supports ikeepitRAREHANDS
[1:58:10] nausikha_lotus: @oldskateboard i think in high ranks sup are supposed to roam whatever theyre playing
[1:58:33] OrianaLand: @oldskateboard all supp roams
[1:58:46] ThatOneShotBruh: fair
[1:58:48] Rhaastifarian: In game of course
[1:58:48] BumbIeBree: BumbIeBree subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:58:51] 4lorn1: but there's a difference between a good roam and just ditching lane
[1:59:13] Austxo_: only in lcs
[1:59:16] Austxo_: lol
[1:59:16] ThatOneShotBruh: I think the term is: "I'd Talon E off the balcony"

[1:59:27] cideztv: join to an ADC moment Sadge
[2:00:08] ThatOneShotBruh: I only played Jhin mid, bot is such coinflip it got me mad, especially considering the bs that is considered "support" these days (e.g., Pantheon, Shaco, Sion, etc.)
[2:00:11] Austxo_: ? ward
[2:00:14] Austxo_: kekw

[2:00:42] Xalrentaru: This Sona is a textbook afk-chanter who makes adcs stop playing adc lmao
[2:00:45] skybobbles: I think u upset her

[2:37:49] zizooboy: @nausikha_lotus yeah, but is not point and click cc so i hard to q on talon, not the easiest target, alistar, veigar etc i think should be much more easy cc
[2:37:49] nausikha_lotus: no I don’t disagree with you I just think she probably won’t get banned for it unfortunately
[2:37:57] zipztah: play trist
[2:38:09] nausikha_lotus: @zizooboy definitely agree
[2:38:10] gfuncle: My supports love to leave lane then flame me when I ask them to come back

[2:40:00] zizooboy: jhin cannot carry had last game was like 10-1 but had a malz that just feeds all the lane and loose the game, cause enemy had jhin ashe graves and yone, we had malz, malphjte lilla and senna we were 2 v 5 basically LUL

[2:40:49] Nightbot: Check out Anomaly Agent here! One of the most wishlisted games on steam! https://lurk.ly/9Y7rnj
[2:41:00] ThatOneShotBruh: my guess Vanguard cant remove accounts that botted before it existed
[2:41:10] nausikha_lotus: is vanguard going to get rid of scripters? if so that’s good
[2:41:40] s_o_u_lz: @ThatOneShotBruh but why cant it work that way, you can right click it to exit when the game is not there so why cant they add that option
[2:41:42] zk950: @skybobbles Yeah I tried on Lucian and played better than normal rune. Would try that on MF too.

[3:15:32] zk950: @mattc2018 Yeah don't forget you can build whatever now, that made me so happy
[3:15:37] FrankLeeCL: Considering your deaths were for overstaying too
[3:15:43] AliensSmokeToo: @mattc2018 sad adc noises
[3:15:54] wantlosedbotlaner: he shoulda gone lethality jhin imo
[3:15:55] asol_lover: darius kinda has the same problem u need to win lane
[3:16:00] bostani1: holyyy top diff
[3:16:02] HaiderSultanArc: They should remove 14% less damage no Crit for Jhin
[3:16:22] mattc2018: yeaaaa adc's either are huge for a team or absolute trash @AliensSmokeToo
[3:16:57] zk950: No matter how fed ADC are, they still need peel
[3:17:07] mattc2018: that's kinda a good thing no?
[3:17:08] HaiderSultanArc: Man this Lee Sin is too good
[3:17:13] ThatOneShotBruh: do you think ADCs are fixable as a role? IMO, the problem lies in the fact that burst has become insane, meaning that unless you can burst faster than they can burst you, you are useless
[3:17:18] AliensSmokeToo: adc are huge only by yuumi
[3:17:30] AliensSmokeToo: otherwise they die in 1 sec by anyone
[3:17:33] ThatOneShotBruh: also, there is too much mobility and CC now
[3:18:10] mattc2018: i mean that makes sense no?
[3:18:13] rk_gaby: PLAY PALWORLD
[3:18:15] coreyelle: how are u taco have u been well ikeepitROACH ikeepitRAREBOI
[3:18:24] zk950: lmao Talon
[3:18:26] mattc2018: i guess i wasn't considering solo queueing
[3:18:29] ThatOneShotBruh: yeah, but I feel ADC used to be much better like 10 years ago (jeez I am old), I remember ADC being mega popular when now its basically the least popular role
[3:18:55] mcegginton: Thoughts on Hwei support?
[3:18:58] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[3:19:08] rk_gaby: Did u see the new trundle jungle meta=)?
[3:19:55] mattc2018: i mean imo the game should be like this
[3:19:57] mcegginton: What is the actual least popular role?
[3:20:02] zk950: Yeah see? Talon feed but still can kill Taco
[3:20:03] RatCoffee: have you considered switching role or do you think it's not worth it at this stage
[3:20:08] ThatOneShotBruh: @mcegginton AFAIK ADC
[3:20:15] mcegginton: I know supports used to be the least but I think a lot of people play it now
[3:20:25] AliensSmokeToo: but even if u have sup its still so weak
[3:20:26] ThatOneShotBruh: at least according to what the queue says is the priority role
[3:20:26] loljss: Unfortunately learning to ping and communicate effectively through them is almost necessary for adc without comms
[3:20:30] mattc2018: sucks for solo queuers but yea like otherwise its unbalanced af
[3:20:38] TheLoFiAxolotl: Support is still the only role that you're autofill protected because it's by far the least popular
[3:20:50] zk950: GGWP
[3:21:19] ThatOneShotBruh: @TheLoFiAxolotl nah, this is untrue, I've seen ADC give autofill protection much, much more than support
[3:21:33] ThatOneShotBruh: it's usually ADC and jg AFAIK
[3:21:35] mattc2018: imo its nice that adcs now aren't running thru lobbies lol
[3:21:54] amar_0910: Is jhin mid valuable this season ?
[3:22:14] zk950: ADC change lane meta :D
[3:22:35] zk950: I saw Lethal Cait mid last time
[3:22:36] mattc2018: so i assume a lot of the playerbase are solo queuers? and that can cause riot to make buffs that aren't great for 5 stacks
[3:23:07] ThatOneShotBruh: @mattc2018 I mean, what is more popular, flex or soloq?
[3:23:14] Lichyness: Imagine if somehow the community forced ad/supp into toplane due to it being harder to gank
[3:23:22] amar_0910: started playing jhin cuz I saw your Videos but on mid
[3:23:25] zk950: Better MF win
[3:23:25] ThatOneShotBruh: and Ez is banned xD

[3:36:50] Numbah214: taco, the problem with lucian is that he's a lane bully who can't be married to senna or nami because he's already married to crit
[3:37:14] Numbah214: jhin can go full lethality
[3:37:15] asol_lover: i lagged so i missed everything :(
[3:37:22] Numbah214: mf can go full lethality
[3:37:32] JackSkalliov: Chat, what's more important? Food or getting a cool car?
[3:37:39] SuaveADC: cool car full of food
[3:37:40] Numbah214: if lucian goes full lethality he might as well not bother ranking his ulti
[3:37:44] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: is there any particular situation u would pick fleet over dark harvest?
[3:37:49] kaiserwroth: Definitely getting a house 4House
[3:37:50] asol_lover: @SuaveADC tru
[3:37:51] JackSkalliov: @SuaveADC Can't afford both sadly
[3:37:58] Numbah214: according to lltrigger anyway
[3:38:00] JackSkalliov: @kaiserwroth How much horsepower does a car have?
[3:38:09] JackSkalliov: I am stupid
[3:38:11] JackSkalliov: I meant house xd
[3:38:15] kaiserwroth: Enough to make you lose everything
[3:38:20] SuaveADC: what car is it
[3:38:27] kaiserwroth: COPIUM
[3:38:32] JackSkalliov: Dodge Viper xd
[3:38:37] SuaveADC: then the car obviously fuck food
[3:38:44] snipefor20: @SuaveADC lada
[3:38:52] JackSkalliov: I'm never actually getting it, but it's fun to ask hypothetical questions like this
[3:39:09] kaiserwroth: You can’t move without a car you can move with food so a house is the obvious choice COPIUM
[3:39:12] zk950: That dash
[3:39:12] JackSkalliov: The quicker option would be an Audi S5 xd
[3:39:14] Cryolite_Crow: @JackSkalliov Don't dodge vipers, face them head-on
[3:39:14] SuaveADC: vipers are coffins anyway probably die in that before you starve anyway
[3:39:22] mcegginton: HE DID THE THING
[3:39:24] zk950: Lucian dash toward tower lmao
[3:39:30] JackSkalliov: @Cryolite_Crow Have you seen what they look like? I am NOT messing with that
[3:39:35] Numbah214: really sad that this game is so often decided by whether or not your teammates are bad, rather than whether or not the enemy is better.
[3:39:38] ThatOneShotBruh: catJAM
[3:39:54] JackSkalliov: @SuaveADC I actually like it when my inanimate objects have a personality. It's like I have to develop a relationship with my car so it doesn't kill me
[3:39:57] SuaveADC: it is sad @Numbah214 feels like you cant even play adc if your support gets gapped
[3:40:24] Cryolite_Crow: @JackSkalliov Fight him🐍
[3:40:30] SuaveADC: just have to spend 20/30 mins in pergatory and hope you can farm into late game relevance its a sad time to be an adc main

[3:41:58] RespectJhin: why no collector first?
[3:42:01] suprabond: @JackSkalliov cars tend to be heeavier than humans
[3:42:05] asol_lover: Btw, i was wondering chat, so lethality does more than crit? is lethality better than crit overall?
[3:42:08] Trioner_: How s games going?
[3:42:14] Cryolite_Crow: @JackSkalliov bad matchup, true

[3:55:11] ThatOneShotBruh: @antiphased you can feel it when a game is over, you can be winning in terms of kills and still know its a losing game because of your teammates tilting and inting

[3:56:12] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: why every time a time takes all grubs, they lose?
[3:56:16] mirnoli: also doesn't it matter where those 23 and 19 are? like certain champs/positions being more fed is worse than others?
[3:56:21] AwesomeInABox: since it directly impacts the mental in emerald
[3:56:23] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: shouldnt it be the opposite?
[3:56:28] IJohNGR: @SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen hahaha exactly
[3:56:46] ThatOneShotBruh: grubs are borderline useless, you need 1 or 2 and you are good
[3:56:47] IJohNGR: as im saying whole day today , crubs = game loss
[3:57:04] AwesomeInABox: i feel like grubs should be a consolation prize/if its trully free
[3:57:05] IJohNGR: cuz if you take crubs but lanes losing , how you will push
[3:57:07] mattc2018: so that is a new feature that is garbage

[4:38:50] plojene: do you play jhin against super tanky comp and how u build vs those tanks in late game
[4:38:51] MrFawkinSunshine: so riot took away armor and mr runes?
[4:38:58] ThatOneShotBruh: PLAY JHMID
[4:39:15] JackSkalliov: We both know you read my message
[4:39:30] akirafudo0655: @ThatOneShotBruh sorry ı just need clear he is in game so
[4:39:30] MrFawkinSunshine: is Phrek just losing is mind and trying to create more damage in game?

[4:39:47] akirafudo0655: reason why ı ask twice getting rp in my country pain.
[4:40:14] akirafudo0655: thankyou taco
[4:40:35] Piemaster_7: @MrFawkinSunshine the hp runes replacing it are fairly similar for the most part
[4:40:41] Angira92: @IKeepItTaco what's your stance on mandatory Vanguard install for league?
[4:40:51] akirafudo0655: ı guess ım listen your advice and getting soul fighter next your shop.
[4:40:59] Nightbot: Check out Anomaly Agent here! One of the most wishlisted games on steam! https://lurk.ly/9Y7rnj
[4:41:05] zk950: I remember in my country to get RP, you go to the shop, buy a gift card and get the number, input 12 number manually to get token, exchange token to rp
[4:41:13] MrFawkinSunshine: @Piemaster_7 to a degree ... it out scales flat armor or mr but sometimes early game armor or mr is needed
[4:41:22] MidnightCityTV: @IKeepItTaco is teemo support viable in your mind?
[4:41:27] MrFawkinSunshine: But then again RIOT could just give us actual RUNES BACK
[4:41:42] akirafudo0655: what if enemy get missfortune what you gonna play?
[4:41:45] Macklez_: eve vs rengar is hell for eve
[4:41:46] MrFawkinSunshine: I truly miss having rune pages for certain comps /match ups
[4:42:00] InkyBabaYaga: I finally made it to bronze 3 after 6 games of going up and down
[4:42:12] akirafudo0655: what if enemy pick missfortune what you pick?
[4:42:15] bundy__wolf: I miss the old runes
[4:42:22] Monster340: MF???
[4:42:28] xWickedTx: I miss season 4 runes
[4:42:39] zk950: Attrox and Kalista? shiet
[4:42:40] GionLucaCaragiale: 8y78y7877y8n
[4:42:48] Official_Owo: I do not miss the old runes PepeLaugh
[4:42:54] MrFawkinSunshine: @xWickedTx you arent getting masteries and rune mixed?
[4:43:06] NightRuins: @Official_Owo i miss mr
[4:43:31] bundy__wolf: I miss 40 attack speed rune John
[4:43:37] ThatOneShotBruh: @xWickedTx why? that was the single worst part of old League
[4:43:47] bundy__wolf: Had I think 96 to 104 ad jhin
[4:43:52] xWickedTx: @MrFawkinSunshine Im not
[4:44:04] MrFawkinSunshine: @ThatOneShotBruh most people didnt liek runes due to the IP gate
[4:44:16] ThatOneShotBruh: @MrFawkinSunshine yeah, that is my point
[4:44:20] ThatOneShotBruh: I hated that system
[4:44:24] bundy__wolf: It was runes or 🏆 ns
[4:44:35] ThatOneShotBruh: the best change in League's history is the "new" rune system
[4:44:43] zk950: Pray for good support this time
[4:44:48] lemonwhoo: peepoDJ
[4:44:50] xWickedTx: I mean obviously its an opinionated topic lol
[4:45:19] MrFawkinSunshine: @ThatOneShotBruh but  easy fix was to do away with the IP and let people have access to runes and rune pages ... I hated league since the new rune sytem/mastery with mythics.
[4:45:26] MrFawkinSunshine: now mthyics are gone
[4:45:42] MrFawkinSunshine: they need to add some more runes or buff the masteries to compenstate
[4:45:45] bundy__wolf: Never like the mythics
[4:45:52] ThatOneShotBruh: @MrFawkinSunshine I mean, new runes allow you to adjust them more for each match, before you had to make them very, very general
[4:46:56] MrFawkinSunshine: @ThatOneShotBruh WELL , if you had multiple rune pages as you have access to now... you can set up pages for the match ups ahead of time . like if you were mid and get matched vs a LB mid u would take HP and MR runes with magic pen
[4:46:58] MrFawkinSunshine: as a mage
[4:46:59] ThatOneShotBruh: well, time for Bard to perma roam
[4:47:09] MrFawkinSunshine: or vs a panth , take armor
[4:47:22] zk950: The blue buff save lol
[4:47:23] noTraycyStiftrue: @MrFawkinSunshine i dont get what you're trying to say tbh
[4:47:37] StarBakedBread: but the assist tho?
[4:47:38] ThatOneShotBruh: @MrFawkinSunshine yeah, but the pages were VERY expensive and I think the number of individual runes was shared across pages (could be wrong)
[4:47:56] ThatOneShotBruh: and you couldn't edit them in cham selecty
[4:47:59] AliensSmokeToo: xff
[4:48:11] Mcbensky: its been a problem this patch
[4:48:14] lemonwhoo: i feel like world atlas orbs are very funky this season
[4:48:15] StarBakedBread: i mean i suppose the gold might be roughly equal but lack of xp :/
[4:48:16] NapNapoleon: Bugged shit
[4:48:30] MrFawkinSunshine: @ThatOneShotBruh well now u could... cuz u can in champ select as it is
[4:48:33] xWickedTx: @ThatOneShotBruh I think we are misunderstanding eachother, i think we are saying we like old system if they updated it and let you edit in champ select
[4:48:39] zk950: This bard is nice
[4:49:00] Nightbot: highest account atm (660 LP 59% wr): deeplol.gg/summoner/na/Flash%204th%20Shot
[4:49:09] ThatOneShotBruh: editing them in champ select would be AIDs though, it would take tooooo much time based on how they worked
[4:49:11] StarBakedBread: idk how the new supp items work :/
[4:49:24] vich0x: hi taco
[4:49:33] xWickedTx: @ThatOneShotBruh Not really, they were fast, and you could have preset ones and just slightly edit them
[4:49:44] MrFawkinSunshine: @xWickedTx exactly
[4:49:56] zk950: 4 man bot?

[4:50:04] MrFawkinSunshine: LOL
[4:50:06] StarBakedBread: Avengers have assembled
[4:50:11] ThatOneShotBruh: I mean, changing MR to armor meant you had to drag what, 7 times? now you click like 3 buttons total
[4:50:17] shadow_boi1: The hit squad arrived
[4:50:26] zk950: Remind me of "Just play safe mid" video lol
[4:50:39] xWickedTx: @ThatOneShotBruh Again I'm not saying they cant update it and make it easier lol like just right click to add and remove?
[4:50:52] StarBakedBread: @zk950 gonna be even more true with the new gank angles
[4:50:58] xWickedTx: Of course I dont want them to add s4 system in s14 lol
