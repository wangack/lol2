[0:54:33] selahwastaken: but now clone will fake those spells but how? e is one thing but if you place w will clone fake a w in the same spot or will it just fake a w on itself?

[0:58:07] TheBearness: @yonsandaime Shaco’s clone will now attack the nearest visible enemy champion within 1500 range of it when dead. Shaco’s clone will now stop to cast the fake W and will only do so within 300 units of Shaco prime. Shaco clone will stop to cast a fake E and will only do so within 575 units of Shaco prime’s E target, this also fakes a missile.

[2:30:29] Cataclxsm: Just started playing today on the new patch, have you noticed the clone attack bug??
[2:31:10] Nome_de_Utilizador: Bard troll

[2:34:24] mikesway1991: @Cataclxsm whats the bug?
[2:34:46] mikeeey: chase talked about something w the E
[2:35:38] Cataclxsm: @mikesway1991 i tested it in the practice tool and I think it just happened to him. It seems like sometimes when the clone mimics the E and W it will just stop attacking and stand there. And in the case of Baron and Dragon it will start walking around it very oddly
[2:36:46] mikeeey: think there's the same bug w annie, noticed multiple times that tibbers stopped attacking when i used skills..
[2:36:55] Nightbot: @Nome_de_Utilizador -> Questionable judgement. [stop spamming caps] [warning]
[2:37:16] braindead_jungle: just what Shaco needed, more bugs
[2:37:42] Cataclxsm: super annoying man, I read the patch notes and was happy that Shaco was getting so QoL but no, he got more bugs fml
[2:37:55] braindead_jungle: honestly I was kind of sus on the changes as soon as I read it
