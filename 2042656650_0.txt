[0:23:19] Nightbot: Nick really likes the new Asol. For him its OG Asol > post rework Asol > pre rework Asol. You generate stacks by either having enemies die in your E, Champions stand in your E, hit by your R or Qing them for longer than a second at a time. Stacks strenghen your abilities, making them stronger and larger. You should have at least 10/stacks a minute early game and then more than that the longer the game goes. blehhhhhhhhhh

[0:53:30] DarcStarrVG: Well true, but the pick rate is comparable to support, only 1% less and like 5% higher winrate, that seems significant no? Or am I just looking at it wrong?
[0:53:34] AyyeKaleb: that negative wr is probably cause of me and my dumb teamates in silver hehe
[0:53:38] valyum_: ive had a 51% winrate on akali (like 6 patches ago, when she was still useless in lane), now 80%

For Christ’s sake please stop fucking moaning and whining every time something doesn’t go your way in game. Do you even have any idea how TRIGGERING it is to hear a grown ass man like who who gets to play video games for a living moan??? Just because he got a kill? Like legit cosplaying as a nutting girl so quit it. It doesn’t matter if your game play is decent your attitude is so FUCKING ANNOYING
