[2:43:21] KashMoneyKale: insane value
[2:43:42] tony_harhko: stupid question, would randuins be better than frozen since we have thornmail?
[2:44:14] KashMoneyKale: tony_harhko randuins is ALWAYS mathematically better than thornmail after people have 60%+ crit chance
[2:44:28] Couwcouw: @KashMoneyKale Learning NOTED
[2:44:40] KashMoneyKale: which makes it broken vs yone/yas since they scale crit so much quicker
[2:45:07] KashMoneyKale: @Couwcouw the breakpoint is between 40% and 60% crit i forget exactly where
[2:45:18] KashMoneyKale: i did all the math on this in a spreadsheet lol
[2:45:39] tony_harhko: @KashMoneyKale I meant that since we're building bramble, would reduced attack speed from frozen heart be anti-synergy?
[2:45:45] salvos_song: Prayge

[2:46:21] WaterbedG: Looking
[2:46:47] salvos_song: sounds good
[2:46:50] KashMoneyKale: @tony_harhko the problem with frozen is that it doesn't give health, and they have lots of true damage
[2:46:57] salvos_song: sapling is such bs
[2:47:02] KashMoneyKale: the AS reduction is nice, but randuins just outperforms especially this game vs 3 adcs
