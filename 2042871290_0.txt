[6:51:11] bigglesworthphd: fair enough
[6:51:13] DudeBroMaximus: Build dat ho
[6:51:28] TonyelGalati: How did senna not get nerfed this recent patch wtf
[6:51:35] TonyelGalati: the fk riot
[6:51:51] quincy_chan: seraphine too
[6:51:52] TonyelGalati: a 56%winrate champion though
[6:51:57] RlyBadPlyer: the riot special?
[6:52:07] denunciator: back in the day we called it Olafing
[6:52:08] denunciator: LUL
[6:52:09] ejhavok: they have mentioned they dont wanna do that if possible right now
[6:52:12] RodNimrod: You mean like what they're doing to Teemo and Rumble?
[6:52:20] echterjerome: I think Senna is in a weird spot right now. Not weak but really far from OP.
[6:52:21] TonyelGalati: the item nerf for her isnt even that much
[6:52:37] RlyBadPlyer: beware of hitting more than the cs limit allows btw
[6:52:52] RlyBadPlyer: you literally cannot proc support item
[6:52:54] TonyelGalati: @echterjerome she has the highest winrate by far. its disgusting, you should see the lists
[6:52:59] ejhavok: why'd they take away the debuff indicator for the minion cut
[6:53:08] quincy_chan: senna can build literally anything so no item nerf can affect her
[6:53:08] echterjerome: She really shines with Seraphine but shes so squishy. You have to play her a bit like an enchanter. As soon as you're  somewhat isolated u get one shot by everyone.
[6:53:34] quincy_chan: @echterjerome literally every adc then
[6:53:37] avuloseunda: So many cute chatters here peepoWow :3

[6:54:12] TwitchTime89: LUL
[6:54:24] forgotmypassword44: have u played any teemo this patch
[6:54:25] TonyelGalati: literally look at the data, shes disgustingly overpowered
[6:54:35] TwitchTime89: the patch started today
[6:54:38] call_me_teaa: i dunno who to ban, senna or karma
[6:54:43] call_me_teaa: been banning senna tho
[6:54:52] DudeBroMaximus: I'm a swifty boot addict
[6:54:56] paperknight12: ban mf that is to prevent ur adc from dying
[6:55:12] TwitchTime89: NODDERS
[6:55:12] kairin_: Lmao stunt
[6:55:13] TonyelGalati: @TwitchTime89 yeah and she didnt get nerfed at all so her WR will still be so inflated
[6:55:14] ghostringtft: what minor runes are you taking on most supports now
[6:55:15] quincy_chan: ban seraphine
[6:55:29] call_me_teaa: there are so many champions now that 2 bans per person doesn't seem like a bad idea anymore tbh
[6:55:35] polyTuff: owoTeddy on the train home after my shift hai stunt
[6:55:40] StaticOfficial: Stunt trailblazer and deadman are 100 gold differnce, why not greed the deadmna?

[6:56:20] RlyBadPlyer: not sure how strong that effect is but that exists I guess
[6:56:21] denunciator: senna sera picked twice in a row in LCK now (but both by weaker teams)
[6:56:22] TwitchTime89: QUAAAAAAASONNNNNN!!! @polyTuff

[6:57:34] paperknight12: go deadman's the added passive feels great
[6:57:52] RlyBadPlyer: also ngl I'm a little troll but ardent doesn't seem bad on Senna when the frontline can use it well
[6:58:07] TwitchTime89: how's school going? @polyTuff quason

[6:59:01] shinyclodsire: pajj
[6:59:04] retreedee: the music you listen to is so great to fall asleep to
[6:59:05] criticwhospeaksfacts: cait traps need 0.5secs extra delay, it's too easy spam and land a stun. broken riot mechanic
[6:59:10] retreedee: whats the playlist called?
[6:59:14] TwitchTime89: wideVibe

[6:59:39] kauaihen: !song
[6:59:41] RlyBadPlyer: btw did you see the twitter post that you can get minion debuff just by hitting relic procs in the first 5 minutes?
[6:59:43] criticwhospeaksfacts: @retreedee lofi anime i guess
[7:00:05] TwitchTime89: @RlyBadPlyer nope
[7:00:19] call_me_teaa: @RlyBadPlyer minion debuff?
[7:00:42] quincy_chan: embarrassing
[7:00:45] echterjerome: what do you think about taking the ms rune on senna?
[7:00:49] RlyBadPlyer: @TwitchTime89 apparently you can get enough relic procs to get the csing debuff and make your support item useless til minute 5
[7:01:20] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 oh wow. no, i never read that or heard it,....until now. ty
[7:01:52] criticwhospeaksfacts: nasus 3shot kill
[7:01:55] quincy_chan: xdd
[7:02:05] echterjerome: nasus angle
[7:02:09] call_me_teaa: yesterday i was playing a game and for some good seconds i couldn't get support item proc, even when i was close to my adc
[7:02:09] RlyBadPlyer: @TwitchTime89 also catching an early wave is really detrimental because it can also give you cs debuff
[7:02:11] call_me_teaa: it was weird
[7:02:12] quincy_chan: nasus 1v9
[7:02:17] RlyBadPlyer: Lathyrus found out the hard way :)
[7:02:22] criticwhospeaksfacts: all of a sudden nasus mid in challenger elo is op.
[7:02:24] DudeBroMaximus: Who let the dawg out
[7:02:48] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 ohhh. you always have to watch the wave
[7:03:15] RlyBadPlyer: I mean, it shouldn't matter beyond some pretty rough scenarios
[7:03:16] call_me_teaa: @TwitchTime89 wdym?
[7:03:18] TwitchTime89: @DudeBroMaximus woof woof
[7:03:21] RlyBadPlyer: but it's really inconvenient to watch out for
[7:03:33] criticwhospeaksfacts: this game just shows, you can play unorthodox champs and still win games. think about it, nasus mid in challenger elo. twitch chat you got no excuse now
[7:03:35] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 you have to make sure you don't push the wave
[7:03:49] TwitchTime89: @RlyBadPlyer yeah, it would be
[7:04:01] DudeBroMaximus: Yuumi jungle then, got it @criticwhospeaksfacts
[7:04:10] TwitchTime89: stuntNoted
[7:04:19] RlyBadPlyer: also not me trying to find a loophole with the double support item for clash this weekend
[7:04:21] call_me_teaa: ah, i know that, i'm saying i wasn't getting any supp procs despite having 3 stacks, not sure if i was hitting enemies or not anymore but i was simply not getting them
[7:04:27] criticwhospeaksfacts: @DudeBroMaximus too extreme, lowkey that works probably up to gold but more viable champs you can get to challenger
[7:04:38] RlyBadPlyer: @call_me_teaa yeah that's minion debuff
[7:04:40] DudeBroMaximus: I wasn't... being serious
[7:04:49] call_me_teaa: @RlyBadPlyer *oh*
[7:04:52] criticwhospeaksfacts: what if you ignore the stacks and just farm unlimited cs with the support item chat?
[7:05:01] TwitchTime89: @call_me_teaa ohhhh. Weirdge
[7:05:11] RlyBadPlyer: @criticwhospeaksfacts the support item's gold gen is also disabled afaik
[7:05:20] RlyBadPlyer: like the passive gold/sec
[7:05:25] Lord_Knofington: @stunt is karma now op ?

[7:24:32] criticwhospeaksfacts: @stunt  Maybe you should just play mid and do some Magifelix gameplay style to carry? or is that meta not viable now?
[7:25:02] RlyBadPlyer: @DrGoldfishe I think Sylas plays similarly like a kill support
[7:25:11] RlyBadPlyer: but idk if he's like
[7:25:14] RlyBadPlyer: your thing
[7:26:06] criticwhospeaksfacts: it's either play "boring" and win lp but lose your mental and will to play or play how you play atm
[7:26:10] echterjerome: tf has no much agancy too
[7:26:14] DrGoldfishe: @RlyBadPlyer Ive tried sylas jungle and was not really liking it. Really any champ that has a delayed ability I dont really like (like Jana Q)

[7:29:00] criticwhospeaksfacts: Actually, get milk tea without the pearls, then once you acquire taste add pearls and if you want to take it to next level add all those crazy toppings.
[7:29:14] RlyBadPlyer: Karma is more of a malignance RQ spammer rather than a dedicated enchanter tho
