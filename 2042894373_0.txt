[0:47:45] linkmain777: to be exact it was like -16 but real feel was -22 lo2west was - 26
[0:47:45] misMATTch: I know you bundle but I'm just sayin how can you be cold in LA where it's like lowest 50 F when youve felt -30F before
[0:47:49] wrektangles: how many mice does a pro league team use in a split

[0:48:30] MrRyan91: Sadly yes
[0:48:42] shadowymisstep: I will be honest I don't think a League of Legends streamer Twitch chat is your best bet for this sort of advice
[0:48:53] misMATTch: ^^
[0:49:05] MrRyan91: Well I'm a nurse so...lol
[0:49:15] linkmain777: league players are just advanced chess players
[0:49:36] shadowymisstep: Thank you for your hard work @MrRyan91 but also I think in general we should not be encouraging people to take statements from Twitch chat at face value
[0:49:43] shadowymisstep: Unless it's to sub to Vulcan
[0:49:44] shadowymisstep: You should do that
[0:49:45] MrRyan91: Fair
[0:49:48] shadowymisstep: don't think any harder about that
[0:49:48] ayalabrennan515: ^^
