[0:16:58] xChip102: monte is Taeyoon out of a job?

[0:18:49] najafan: Believe.
[0:19:08] xiBOOSTix: that would be so bad
[0:19:08] Leftenant__Dan: The Goff Staford trade possibly netting both teams superbowls is the greatest trade of all time
[0:19:20] ikssuxd: id be happy with raven vs 49ers with ravens winning
[0:19:23] Giiino: deft what was that
[0:19:25] xChip102: imagine not being a sub to Monte, couldn't be me
[0:19:30] najafan: Deft knows better than that.
[0:20:03] xiBOOSTix: that was a tactical int to keep KDF's mental up so they don't ff too fast
[0:20:11] tmihee: Deft is washed now FeelsWeirdMan
[0:20:11] Shriez: Deft should stop pretending to be Deftly
[0:20:12] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: A Chiefs-less superbowl sounds like a better superbowl
[0:20:36] Camer0n000: what is the one .gg websites that you can see the highest winrate champions in pro

[0:35:05] Amosdragon: KDF just saw the bullying PerfecT received on Udyr and thought they could replicate it.
[0:35:26] Shriez: He upgraded the Bami, what should he have done otherwise?
[0:35:39] WashedxUp222: Dang i thought he went to early on the azri ult but still got 2
[0:35:54] najafan: @Shriez Spend the money he used on the upgrade towards rookern instead.

[0:37:41] hibbjibb: KT VOD review? There better not be any hype going on
[0:37:46] Naxser: @MonteCristo Beryl and Pyosik are like playing Dungeon and Dragons and they're your dices with good luck you can even win worlds :v
[0:38:31] najafan: It's like playing Truenamer
[0:38:43] QuackTheDuck: Yeah but when that nat20 hits you can say, I believed all along
[0:38:54] Nytrodark: Hey @MonteCristo have you seen the ultraliga match fixing of 2 chinese players?
[0:39:39] QuackTheDuck: Senna is so broken
[0:39:40] saberaxe: hmmm @MonteCristo do you think we are going to see udyr be flexxed sometime?
[0:39:43] spucky117: I saw a dice creator on ig who made loaded die... where it was weighted for a 2 so it hit 20s like 10%
[0:40:08] Amosdragon: You could not make that match fixing any more obvious.
[0:40:12] atbth: are you in Korea?
[0:40:23] Nytrodark: those 2 chinese player fly to a tier 3 league just to gamble fucking legends
[0:40:27] QuackTheDuck: Is it really match fixing if they won anyway tho?
[0:40:47] jooshboxes: I’m what situations do you think cryptobloom is better than void?
[0:40:57] Camer0n000: if karma isnt perma banned in lcs will it get flexxed mid and support
[0:41:03] Camer0n000: idk if its still good top
[0:41:17] Nekor_: You get CDR
[0:41:46] najafan: Unless you just need to nuke a dude.
[0:42:03] Nekor_: Will prolly nerf it down the line atleast the CDR on it
[0:42:05] najafan: Very situational when void is better
[0:42:14] karxlek: Its a bit champion dependant as well. Karthus still wants void
[0:42:15] Amosdragon: @QuackTheDuck Well yes. The attempt was very clear. The fact that they still won makes it hilarious though.
[0:42:19] jooshboxes: still seeing a lot of void in lcs I wonder if we will see more bloom this week
[0:42:35] zen__cloud: i'm curious what the best ornnament items are now

[0:43:56] Leftenant__Dan: ah

[0:45:11] Leftenant__Dan: pyosik moment
[0:45:22] cactu_th6: is it just me or are rumble ults dealing no damage this season
[0:45:26] littleindianman12: DRX pyosik activated
[0:45:32] WashedxUp222: I think KT saw red and went for kills thinking the games over
[0:46:21] Lamynator: it's amazing how I haven't watched league for some 7 years and yet this KT seems to have the same exact MO as the KT of old
[0:46:49] Sjkaev: pyosik LUL

[0:49:01] fljqpy: he has 250 cs
[0:49:09] gorwings: i was wondering about the support orn
[0:49:16] Camer0n000: senna has a 45kda in 3 lec games
[0:49:30] jooshboxes: yea it’s the double support items too but it’s a really clever pick to abuse the current items
[0:49:41] gorwings: is it better than senna/tahm or senna/sion?
[0:50:04] profound23: Just feels like the adc items dont really outscale the ornn tank items
[0:50:12] profound23: as well as they used to
[0:50:30] SirKavouris: why ornn didnt upgrade deathcap?
[0:50:30] Camer0n000: would senna chogath still work

[0:51:27] Edge2G: xayah actually pretty stronk
[0:51:35] Camer0n000: best they could do was buff the resolve tree and nerf damage items
[0:51:57] profound23: Udyr feels like the embodiment of the meta right now just a tanky stat checker
[0:52:05] fljqpy: ornn upgrade is OP wcyd
[0:52:17] Shriez: makes me think of the Ksante copy paste seeing Ornn

[1:27:14] Jeffp2662: tennis was infamous for it in the past

[1:27:44] Animaitic: That was such fiesta
[1:27:44] SonsOfJarvan: @xrime17 Dude, they play in about 5 hrs, ind youtube and twitch lck channels
[1:27:45] lazink: one of the most famous match fixing to occur is the Black Sox world series
[1:27:45] lyfjabergen: Why would he call Wayward a dog tho
[1:27:53] David_P00le: @xrime17 if you mean LCK CL you need to have a look on Afreeka i guess
[1:27:56] paddlestar_gallactica: OnlyCristo
[1:28:01] xrime17: gen g academy
[1:28:05] Sjkaev: Sadge
[1:28:07] SonsOfJarvan: Oh not watchable
[1:28:10] cuyah: whats the reason for that?
[1:28:14] carnivalnights: What VPN do you use Monte? And do you coincidentally have a code?
[1:28:17] SonsOfJarvan: Theres only 3 games at the same time and only one is streamed
[1:28:20] captainkrajick: @cuyah Korea bandwidth tax laws
[1:28:22] Leftenant__Dan: twitch leaving Korea sure was a choice
[1:28:28] Shobes572: they’re pushing internal Korean services
[1:28:30] xrime17: @sonsofjarvan gen g academy now

[1:28:34] Sjkaev: whats the korean version twitch? is there any?
[1:28:38] kaarataka: !vpn
[1:28:41] Nytrodark: if you're an esports guy tell me 3 famous match-fixing incidents from all esports games. @MonteCristo
[1:28:44] Jeffp2662: What will that mean for major events in Korea that are normally on twitch
[1:28:47] captainkrajick: @Sjkaev Afreeca, Naver, and one new one starting with C
[1:28:56] Sjkaev: @captainkrajick thanks!
[1:28:57] kaarataka: Afreeca
[1:28:58] Nytrodark: and most of them are valve games
[1:29:00] Shobes572: made sustaining twitch in Korea non-viable
[1:29:04] Respect_Dat1: @Nytrodark lol just making demands?
[1:29:08] Leftenant__Dan: imagine living in a country with dumb internet rules, couldnt be me
[1:29:22] SonsOfJarvan: @xrime17 Tellin u bro, cant watch it cause there are 3 lck cl matches playing RN, and i gues  GEN 0ne is not being streamed
[1:29:23] Nytrodark: wtf cuzz steals that?
[1:29:35] captainkrajick: classic Pyosik
[1:29:37] Nytrodark: NA spirit LUL
[1:29:47] najafan: @Shobes572 Oh that's just obviously false. There are far more innocent people, so if there's even a small false positive rate there's going to be a reasonable number of false accusations. (Also, there are studies here, it's actually pretty common, something like 30%.)
[1:29:52] WashedxUp222: what does he smite
[1:29:56] WashedxUp222: nothing? lol
[1:29:58] Nytrodark: crumbly fingers

[1:30:20] theancientdreamer: too busy pressing q
[1:30:23] kaarataka: ult
[1:30:26] JhpiexD: his inner NA kicking in
[1:30:27] kaarataka: smite yep
[1:30:33] Respect_Dat1: he's match-fixing Kappa
[1:30:35] captainkrajick: @Shobes572 if a true positive is a 1% chance, a false positive is a 9% chance based on probability
[1:30:40] Nytrodark: @Giiino saintvicious dont play lol and coach lol anymore
[1:30:45] Nytrodark: he's a tft player now
[1:30:45] SonsOfJarvan: @MonteCristo Idk if it is because i bet on this game, BUT I HAVE A STRONG FEELING THIS WAS FIXED
[1:30:55] kaarataka: I never thought pyosik was good, even when he won worlds
[1:30:56] Mirukubun: Cuzz and bros with the heist
[1:31:04] Sjkaev: DUDU
[1:31:11] captainkrajick: @Shobes572 i'm summarising it very quickly, but it's proportional to how unlikely something is. you'll get a false positive the x times more
[1:31:12] wryjester: They they do. Dudu...
[1:31:19] fruge2: world champion pyosik
[1:31:20] xxxi_wud_nvrstp_uxxx: @Nytrodark its an old school joke
[1:31:55] lyfjabergen: It is just so frustrating watching Pyosik
[1:32:11] Sjkaev: pyosik got that noc player 3head brain; if i aint engaging i aint pressing R
[1:32:12] Leftenant__Dan: Andil GOOD?
[1:32:17] Shobes572: @montecristo I guess we don’t have to worry about this iteration of KT winning 😂
[1:32:20] kaarataka: DuDu BBQ
[1:32:20] WashedxUp222: hes better at adc lol
[1:32:30] wryjester: Senna good
[1:32:34] captainkrajick: Bull is really good
[1:32:35] Animaitic: So overall though on VIT vs KC , How entertainingly bad was it? After that and G2 series, I think VIT ggot this
[1:32:42] Sjkaev: LUL
[1:32:44] kaarataka: LuL
[1:32:44] Nytrodark: icant

[1:33:58] Sjkaev: dota analysts on broadcast got no spice
[1:34:08] moonglaives: thats why i love it! it's like watching golf
[1:34:13] JakeJr: DotA casts are often a little cringey
[1:34:16] Animaitic: Do you mind if people repost questions as lon as they do not spam?
[1:34:22] Sjkaev: imagine if they didnt have slacks to pick em up LUL
[1:34:26] najafan: But League desks are largely bad too!
[1:34:30] Camer0n000: cods analyst desks are always boring
[1:34:40] najafan: (I mean, Emily is good in NA, but that's it.)
[1:34:45] Birbmang_: there has been an exception in later years, jenkins is fun
[1:34:48] captainkrajick: League analysts are the complete opposite
[1:34:49] najafan: (LEC has a few)
[1:34:52] moomookus: true
[1:34:55] captainkrajick: in terms of game knowledge
[1:35:01] najafan: @captainkrajick too cringe to be useful, yeah
[1:35:05] Giiino: is there any good analyst desks in esports, or sports in general? besides TNT with the NBA?
[1:35:13] Sjkaev: i cant, if slacks didnt exist, i just cant
[1:35:16] JhpiexD: after 27 min
[1:35:29] wryjester: Always a Hwei
[1:35:36] Birbmang_: also they had 2gd bad in the day
[1:35:36] lyfjabergen: The worst thing is the Melee community ngl, legit just a bunch of 40 year old dudes arguing over whose main is more "sick"
[1:35:51] Animaitic: What the hell is that slow?
[1:35:51] captainkrajick: @Giiino CS is okay I guess
[1:35:56] najafan: Pichu is the sickest, duh
[1:35:56] Animaitic: from DuDU
[1:36:09] captainkrajick: @Giiino but it's getting rough now
[1:36:13] Animaitic: also, does DuDu know what that word means in english?
[1:36:44] SonsOfJarvan: THIS IS JUST GAME 1 MONTE!!!

[1:37:17] Sjkaev: is twisted fate not viable?
[1:37:35] najafan: People casting TCGs is also so weird.
[1:37:42] grandezelx: It looks two t1 drafts fighting one another with worse players and worse teams
[1:37:47] najafan: It's pretty golf-esque.
[1:37:51] Sjkaev: thats fair
[1:37:57] Sjkaev: LUL
[1:37:58] JhpiexD: the current mid meta is too strong in lane for tf to do anything
[1:37:58] najafan: At least with magic.
[1:37:59] Nytrodark: LUL
[1:38:00] kaarataka: LuL

[1:38:45] JhpiexD: totally worth it
[1:38:46] boked_seeker: LSV vintage cubes beg to differ
[1:38:49] SonsOfJarvan: Is Bull better than Jiwoo? Hes really looking so good for a rookie in his first series
[1:38:55] JhpiexD: Bull had a great lck debut tbh
[1:38:56] captainkrajick: ADCs should build Zhonyas more often
[1:38:58] Nytrodark: thats a 1600 for that
[1:39:01] najafan: @boked_seeker I said casting, not livestreams.
[1:39:20] lyfjabergen: OLOLOLOLOLOLOL
[1:39:26] captainkrajick: draft was fine, it's just that Udyrs don't know how to play Udyr
[1:39:29] najafan: It's like comparing LCS to a Sneaky stream

[1:39:58] najafan: scg is exactly what I mean, their casting is golf-esque
[1:40:13] Animaitic: So overall though on VIT vs KC , How entertainingly bad was it? After that and G2 series, I think VIT got this!
[1:40:14] lyfjabergen: That draft overlay is criminal

[1:40:23] Sjkaev: oh you're right 7 adc bans LUL wtf is this
[1:40:31] Animaitic: I enjoy when you just make fun of thins
[1:40:34] Respect_Dat1: @lyfjabergen yeah that hurt my head for a little bit lol
[1:40:35] captainkrajick: LCK draft overlay is really bad how they mirror the selection

[1:40:56] Onin_finity: When ori is human

[1:42:02] paddlestar_gallactica: liandrys saplings
[1:42:08] paddlestar_gallactica: pad them stats

[1:45:15] Respect_Dat1: he's almost had as many mordekaiser games LMFAO
[1:45:17] lyfjabergen: Draven feels bad to watch imo - you can just feel the anxiety about the draven snowballing in everyone playing
[1:45:28] Camer0n000: most of those stats are pre world champion buff
[1:45:36] najafan: Bring back Zoe, Fizz, Talon, Zed, exciting mid champs.

[1:46:26] JhpiexD: tells you a lot about his team KEKW
[1:46:34] Respect_Dat1: i'd imagine it's his team
[1:46:36] Camer0n000: i cant wait to see him on immortals next year

[1:52:08] Tears_0f_sin: why did deft walk out of the bush first
[1:52:14] WashedxUp222: the GGG the Gaitlin Gun Gamble
[1:52:21] lyfjabergen: But moar people
[1:52:33] kaarataka: bc jung is starting top for go bot because bot is super volitile
[1:52:52] kaarataka: exactly
[1:52:54] RoughRunner98: I don't like watching corkie man
[1:52:58] Respect_Dat1: I thought Corki takes E first so he can trade better against mages
[1:52:59] Tears_0f_sin: doesn't deft jus tget himself killed walking out of the bush towards them after they saw them
[1:53:20] CrimzsCast: I think kdf could reasonably pull leesin to this play into red steal and split the map
[1:53:48] fartnugget45: corki did so much dmg there
[1:54:01] kaarataka: it covers most of the choke point
[1:54:08] Sjkaev: with a name like that u better go in LUL

[1:54:12] JhpiexD: most people are very conservative on their debut game
[1:54:16] RoughRunner98: Appropriate name
[1:54:21] AvariceTrades: did mid and adc coordinate their names?
[1:54:38] Leftenant__Dan: Didnt WildTurtle get a penta his debut game?
[1:54:40] kaarataka: no
[1:54:52] lightheadtv: whaddup monte
[1:54:58] kaarataka: idk about WT

[1:55:47] Sjkaev: wat
[1:55:52] Komarimasita: he just chose to let him live??
[1:55:53] kaarataka: AA kills
[1:55:54] captainkrajick: Dorans shield 2nd wind
[1:55:56] Dextroslol: dudu popped ghost to run away?
[1:55:56] fljqpy: doran shield strong
[1:56:02] QuackTheDuck: Why dudu kill?
[1:56:03] CrimzsCast: No mana on ksante no passive no dmg
[1:56:07] Camer0n000: dudu win trade?
[1:56:11] heeman1119: i dont think they had vision on maokai
[1:56:12] smingdido: smingdido subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:56:14] QuackTheDuck: wintrading?
[1:56:20] Komarimasita: yea surely that forces flash at a minimumn
[1:56:27] kaarataka: that would make sense
[1:56:31] mifot: think jax skills are about to come back?
[1:56:32] captainkrajick: maokai but yeah
[1:57:04] kaarataka: was mao seen before back?
[1:57:07] CrimzsCast: So he has grasp stacked
[1:57:24] captainkrajick: grasp also
[1:57:33] VanidarD: weird, even if he is worried about mao, he shoulve taken the trade kill
[1:57:39] heeman1119: i think he gets it if he AA resets before the 3rd Q
[1:57:39] WashedxUp222: looks like the pinged top jungle too
[1:57:41] VanidarD: he has tp
[1:57:43] kaarataka: ok, then yes makes sense to not all in, still seems like forcing F is there
[1:57:48] fljqpy: hes just giving a message to perfect
[1:57:53] WashedxUp222: there as a ping before the fight on the brush
[1:58:01] QuackTheDuck: why not just force the flash for ghost trade?
[1:58:04] Anzlan: KDF should have Budol top Blaber or broxah jg & Berryl sup they can be the B team
[1:58:11] killerpineapple1: if i was him i woulda thought that grasp would killed and int walked away
[1:58:15] captainkrajick: @QuackTheDuck then he dies to jg
[1:58:17] kaarataka: @QuackTheDuck if mao is there he dies
[1:58:22] Komarimasita: it might be a comms thing maybe someone called maokai top side
[1:58:26] VanidarD: @am_a_bare maybe bwipo
[1:58:33] captainkrajick: @QuackTheDuck wave is frozen against him also if he dies
[1:58:42] kaarataka: ^ that too
[1:58:54] mifot: xdd
[1:58:54] RathXII: uhhhh

[1:59:14] JhpiexD: brain farted hard there
[1:59:19] xJesta90: you already know the result right? @MonteCristo
[1:59:22] fljqpy: yea he woulda int if he flashed forward
[1:59:24] CrimzsCast: omg the cd is so close
[1:59:25] rilsolo: super close
[1:59:25] captainkrajick: @xJesta90 no
[1:59:27] kaarataka: LuL LuL
[1:59:29] Komarimasita: he tried to flash e and put in movement input for martial pose
[1:59:35] Komarimasita: and hit them wrong
[1:59:37] xJesta90: oh ok, just checking so i dont say spoilers
[1:59:38] VanidarD: nah, just straightup missplay
[1:59:39] xJesta90: thanks
[1:59:41] kaarataka: F backwards LuL
[2:00:19] VanidarD: I mean, he takes too long, but if he insta flashes after pyke he coulda killed wth rend
[2:00:22] LordAnomandaris: He gets a pass for being a gigachad later lol
[2:00:38] Respect_Dat1: they only took 2 grubs?
[2:00:40] heeman1119: whats this take 2 grubs and leave meta?
[2:00:41] fljqpy: lol they just gonna take 2 and left
[2:00:41] captainkrajick: I think so
[2:00:44] VanidarD: he played this well, otherwise
[2:00:50] captainkrajick: I'm hyped for bull
[2:00:55] fljqpy: thats how they feel about gruvs
[2:01:01] CrimzsCast: Stalling grubs, so you dont have to contest for them again. Good if you want dragon.
[2:01:11] kaarataka: greed and misplay
[2:01:32] Warchawk: @VanidarD I think he went "maybe" when he hit Q so he applied one more stack.
[2:01:37] captainkrajick: @heeman1119 take 2 and contest dragon usually
[2:01:38] SonsOfJarvan: How did KT went from winning to DK to this xd
[2:01:44] fljqpy: doesnt get the drake anyway LUL
[2:02:09] captainkrajick: bull played the azir ult really well
[2:02:13] JhpiexD: cd
[2:02:17] JhpiexD: unfortunate
[2:02:21] Play_Time7: imagine if he had flash still
[2:02:21] WashedxUp222: deft didn't get a cash out too so thats a failed team fight
[2:02:22] heeman1119: bull is so close to greatness
[2:02:26] Komarimasita: omg thats the WORST feeling as a kallista
[2:02:26] The_True_Lion: that's bull
[2:02:51] kingkevin619: who dose ddf play next
[2:02:51] fljqpy: its 4v3 its their fault they lost
[2:02:59] Respect_Dat1: that auto attack dodge from azir ult.... holy
[2:03:02] kingkevin619: kdf sorry
[2:03:15] captainkrajick: I thought bull got E reset on Bdd
[2:03:20] WashedxUp222: maybe they are trying to get the cash out?
[2:03:21] CrimzsCast: lck observers are just goated
[2:03:23] VanidarD: sad
[2:03:35] captainkrajick: or does Kalista E not reset on champs
[2:03:42] MansoGanzo: bull on steroids was amazing
[2:04:12] SonsOfJarvan: As a GEN fan, IM SO HAPPY WE CHOSE LEHENDS OVER BERYL
[2:04:15] JhpiexD: its crazy that one player being replaced can cause this much of a impact though
[2:04:16] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:04:25] JhpiexD: just how trash was taeyoon
[2:04:28] Komarimasita: this bot matchup is just so snowbally one way or another
[2:04:33] VanidarD: that was a very clean martial pose
[2:04:48] 고나리킹: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[2:04:48] MansoGanzo: bull wasnt precisely the best CL player though
[2:05:25] Sjkaev: just straight disrespect
[2:05:25] fljqpy: they came back for the 3rd grub lol
[2:05:28] Camer0n000: this is some peak draven gameplay
[2:05:32] SonsOfJarvan: Ruler:c
[2:05:37] captainkrajick: He's a Bull he sees red
[2:05:39] CrimzsCast: i can see some samira in his future
[2:05:40] Komarimasita: that just means hes old!! get em boys
[2:05:44] WashedxUp222: and now the draven is irrelevant
[2:05:52] mifot: the amount of titles on the kt players is distressing
[2:06:12] xJesta90: idk why, but i enjoy watching deft get shit on lol. i honestly have no idea why i dislike him though.
[2:06:15] fljqpy: what titles they have lol
[2:06:35] captainkrajick: @fljqpy 3 world champs botside + LCK titles
[2:06:42] L1am_Maynee: ^
[2:06:44] CrimzsCast: @xJesta90 cause you are a psycho?
[2:06:45] captainkrajick: @fljqpy 1 more worlds in jg
[2:07:03] captainkrajick: @fljqpy Bdd has an LCK title right?
[2:07:13] xJesta90: @CrimzsCast Yea, maybe
[2:07:14] fljqpy: ahh counting same title for each players
[2:07:15] 고나리킹: LUL LUL
[2:07:16] heeman1119: i love this guy KEKW
[2:07:18] VanidarD: ahhhhh
[2:07:20] Sjkaev: nooo
[2:07:22] Komarimasita: wow
[2:07:25] Komarimasita: this guy is truly only in
[2:07:29] VanidarD: this guy has balls but is soooo unlucky on his rend timings lol
[2:07:31] Warchawk: Did Lee died as Reneta was pulled to Kalista ult and couldn't save him. peepoSad
[2:07:32] Camer0n000: this is some extreme edging by bull
[2:07:43] fljqpy: its like saying T1 has 9 worlds titles
[2:07:53] LordAnomandaris: Cuzz got that Leesyndrome
[2:08:05] CrimzsCast: the pyke is so troll, cant we just pick draven milio or something?
[2:08:22] L1am_Maynee: you say that like 2 worlds stil;l isnt alot
[2:08:27] fljqpy: its beryl dont ask LUL
[2:08:46] VanidarD: I think Draven can work, but against kalista and with no enchanter?
[2:08:49] mifot: beryl evidently the goat support
[2:08:56] captainkrajick: Bull reminds me of Able
[2:08:59] Camer0n000: ig theres nothing really to cleanse right
[2:09:01] grandezelx: Draven counters kalista no
[2:09:06] MondariuZ: thanks for recommending the iliad on SI a few weeks back, currently reading it. Fantastic
[2:09:21] Komarimasita: honestly bull would do so well in the LPL

[2:09:21] MondariuZ: Yep
[2:09:26] commando1814: would pros start to play lethality miss fortune?
[2:09:35] commando1814: she's very strong too
[2:09:40] Camer0n000: does tarzan have a team rn
[2:09:46] SPQR_Brutus: I dont like the translation as someone in the field
[2:10:12] SonsOfJarvan: Hes taking summer split vacation
[2:10:14] CrimzsCast: OK thats reminds me. Monte why did they make so many Greek/Roman mythology movies like 30/40 years ago? Do you know what I am talking about?
[2:10:18] SonsOfJarvan: Spring*
[2:10:20] SonsOfJarvan: Fck xd
[2:10:23] Tpro83: I have Robert Fagles' translations of Illiad and Odyssey. They came with highly regarded translations.
[2:11:05] commando1814: my favorite odyssey translation is from the metal band paradise lost
[2:11:35] MondariuZ: Its a great way to experience it for the first time rn
[2:11:38] fljqpy: "designed for modern audiences" so u say there are memes and slangs?
[2:11:48] Tpro83: Is 60 ping too high to play Kalista? She seems like a"0 ping" champ.
[2:11:51] najafan: I prefer the Dan Simmons version. Kappa
[2:12:10] Camer0n000: if turret plates were still 180 gold instead of 125 do you think wed see full team fights for the grubs
[2:12:17] fartnugget45: @najafan Hyperion Cantos is goated
[2:12:27] SPQR_Brutus: I like the pentameter, but her diction choices are bad and lose the "plot", such as "complicated" for Odysseus. The ancient Greeks did a double termination of causality. It is not just O's psychological state but also the external world that affects him
[2:12:35] najafan: @fartnugget45 Ilium is quite good.
[2:12:45] jayjay__18: Loooove Hyperion
[2:12:49] VanidarD: I regret never having learned Greek, I had some Latin in school and read some Roman poets but I always wanted to read something like the Alexiade in original Greek
[2:12:54] gmkoz: I will say it is really enjoyable to listen someone who are genuinely interested in mythology as you. Most people just "fake" their interest
[2:12:55] fartnugget45: @najafan Ilium was alright
[2:12:58] captainkrajick: xdd
[2:13:00] MondariuZ: "a bit"
[2:13:00] fljqpy: LUL
[2:13:06] Tpro83: Brutus too smart
[2:13:12] commando1814: what are the Hyperion books ?
[2:13:26] CrimzsCast: I actually read the cantebury tales before reading Hyperion. It was interesting to see the influences.
[2:13:33] najafan: @fartnugget45 Well the joke is about the Iliad, so that's the point of reference.
[2:13:45] namaste42: @commando1814 american science fiction
[2:13:57] commando1814: @namaste42 ohhh hell yeah
[2:14:00] SPQR_Brutus: Yes. I am a Classics PhD teaching at uni
[2:14:05] fartnugget45: @najafan Yeah I got the joke, Hyperion is just my favorite sci fi so I had to fanboy out when I saw you mention Dan Simmons
[2:14:09] lyfjabergen: Greek mythology is one of those things where I always get excited when someone says they are into it and then my hopes get crushed when more often than not it turns out they only read Percy Jackson
[2:14:11] Tpro83: Mega Smart Brutus! LUL
[2:14:13] commando1814: Enders game is what got me into sci fi

[2:14:22] SPQR_Brutus: ty
[2:14:24] VanidarD: imagine that, a classics Prof in a Lol stream
[2:14:33] fljqpy: HOLY
[2:14:38] fljqpy: he did a faker
[2:14:40] SPQR_Brutus: Graduated ilast august, and I am a teaching position, not professor
[2:14:44] Amosdragon: League is a modern classic Kappa
[2:14:45] unrequitedIove: bulldog dodge
[2:14:47] captainkrajick: @SPQR_Brutus This is a personal question, but have you analysed the King James Bible with the same style of literary analysis?
[2:14:48] unrequitedIove: omg that was clean
[2:14:54] swerllwow: KC games are tragic
[2:14:58] Tpro83: I wonder how many people remember Insec
[2:15:05] Karego: Imagine having more than one interest tho
[2:15:09] SPQR_Brutus: @captainkrajick nope
[2:15:12] CrimzsCast: @captainkrajick I've seen some videos. Other translations are pretty interesting.
[2:15:25] mv_peter: check deft this fight
[2:15:30] najafan: @lyfjabergen I'm just waiting for a popular YA series to go into Yazidism. Should be fun.
[2:15:33] gmkoz: kt would be a really dangerous team if Kiin stayed
[2:15:35] unrequitedIove: look at the corki dodge
[2:15:37] unrequitedIove: on pyke r
[2:15:46] fljqpy: nobody has been to top lane for 18 minutes lol
[2:15:48] Exedra711: Im not high on perfect honestly
[2:15:51] VanidarD: why did the Corki package so early? was it running out?
[2:15:54] JhpiexD: not the best draven player indeed KEKW
[2:15:58] swerllwow: 3 autos
[2:16:02] Komarimasita: deft lost half of his hp by walking through package omg
[2:16:08] heeman1119: hoooly KT looking sloppy
[2:16:18] commando1814: @najafan my brother dragged my ass to read Unsouled ( will wright ) a phenomenal series
[2:16:31] fljqpy: pyosik wtf was that
[2:16:32] RomanticCreampie: deft got his kd confused; he thought the was 5-1
[2:16:35] Camer0n000: im inspressed perfect survived that
[2:16:46] najafan: @commando1814 I've read unsoiled, I'm not sure it has any Yazidi influences?
[2:16:55] VanidarD: man, he just steps right into it and it wasnt even well placed package
[2:16:56] Sjkaev: deft touched the package barrage no way
[2:17:03] WashedxUp222: to end the game as quick as possible LUL
[2:17:11] najafan: unsouled* autocorrect
[2:17:25] Camer0n000: unlucky pyosik got the shutdown and not bdd
[2:17:29] fljqpy: finally they moved away from top,ane
[2:17:32] Komarimasita: i have mad respect for deft's career, but i can see why this is his least played
[2:17:33] xJesta90: i guess deft thought bdd's engage would get more of them
[2:17:40] SPQR_Brutus: @montecristo I am so glad we talked. I have been a big fan of yours since you were coaching CLG
[2:17:43] CrimzsCast: uh oh, kt can win now
[2:17:43] commando1814: @najafan I just saw the " I want well made YA sci fi / fantasy " idk yadizum
[2:17:49] xonsa: nice catch
[2:18:17] commando1814: monte would adore aethan arylius I'd think @najafan
[2:18:40] SPQR_Brutus: super cool!
[2:18:51] cantu55: only a fan since CLG been on the Korean hype train since he was   casting Korea
[2:18:55] captainkrajick: wp by cuzz
[2:19:00] najafan: @commando1814 You should look into it. It's abrahamic-adjacent. Inspired by Zoroastrianism.
[2:19:04] lyfjabergen: Ohh let me tell you, translating them is great, takes some time but damn it's satisfying

[2:19:23] gmkoz: Tickets to Korean hype train moment is one of Monte's iconic moments tbh
[2:19:30] commando1814: @najafan monotheistic or more trinity / classical trio ?
[2:19:35] najafan: It's often compared to Satanism because of a myth about their main divinity that mirrors an Islamic myth about Islam's Satan.
[2:19:39] fljqpy: cuzz v bdd
[2:19:41] pleblurker9: Q s back *
[2:19:45] fateofcain: he Q2 > W there, wild
[2:19:45] najafan: @commando1814 Neither?
[2:19:51] commando1814: hmmmmmm
[2:19:56] najafan: It's straight up polytheism
[2:19:58] captainkrajick: @commando1814 Zoroastrian is polytheist
[2:20:05] najafan: Well, polytheism with a demiurge.
[2:20:08] Camer0n000: if bdd survived could they have rushed baron
[2:20:14] pleblurker9: You're forgiven :)
[2:20:15] Munchables: ooh, we watching classic games from all the way back in 2024?
[2:20:24] captainkrajick: @Munchables Yo munch iwdRun
[2:20:43] CrimzsCast: Fresh pressed
[2:20:54] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo will you be watching LGD vs NIP?
[2:20:54] Munchables: I heard Bull was an absolute monster this series
[2:20:54] xonsa: that dom emote is hideous
[2:20:59] captainkrajick: @xonsa iwdClap
[2:21:00] Munchables: yeah im good cheers, you?
[2:21:03] captainkrajick: @xonsa iwdJAM
[2:21:11] Sjkaev: bull is a bull
[2:21:11] fateofcain: @Munchables he had some missteps but looks like a very promising rookie
[2:21:18] Lucallia: Not even a day old I think that's called spawn-camping.
[2:21:24] commando1814: the reason I ask about the Trio is if it's similar to the Greeks Egypt and Nordic . like there seems to traditionally be 3 supper powerful gods
[2:21:24] Sjkaev: but very good cahones
[2:21:26] Exedra711: Hes pretty good
[2:21:27] VanidarD: Bull has the right Ideas, sometimes not the execution
[2:21:31] Munchables: Sounds like Jackeylove, who happens to be my favourite adc haha
[2:21:34] captainkrajick: I'd rather a player with cajones than none
[2:21:37] CrimzsCast: @MonteCristo Did you hear about NACLOQ not being able to stream because it conflicted with the LCS?
[2:21:47] captainkrajick: @Munchables His mindset reminds me of Able too
[2:21:55] Exedra711: Bull is a limit tester for sure
[2:22:14] L1am_Maynee: have you seen the ultraliga matchfixing scandal at all?
[2:22:15] pleblurker9: Having Bull and Bulldog on the same team must be confusing as fck. I wonder if they just call their mid dog :)
[2:22:25] Munchables: Yeah the tweet he was making instead of showing up to story meeting
[2:22:31] captainkrajick: xdd
[2:22:35] Munchables: but yeah the combo is disgusting
[2:22:36] Komarimasita: damn!
[2:22:39] Exedra711: Speaking of it monte i had a thought
[2:22:40] CrimzsCast: @Munchables knowledge is power
[2:22:47] VanidarD: Corki is giga busted with the items, I think he is in must ban territory
[2:22:48] Diphallus: does luden proc eclipse too?
[2:22:53] najafan: @commando1814 It has a 1, a 7, and a 3.
[2:23:00] Exedra711: Would it be better to forego the manamune to get earlier eclipse maglinance
[2:23:00] Respect_Dat1: umbral glaive is such an oppressive item for supports
[2:23:09] Exedra711: Just sit on the tear
[2:23:23] najafan: But it's really just generically polytheistic.
[2:23:35] Munchables: i think even without malignanace eclipse is insane on corki, it's pretty easy to get an E proc + any ability
[2:23:38] commando1814: @najafan got it !
[2:23:53] commando1814: so what is the right build
[2:23:59] commando1814: for corki
[2:24:04] VanidarD: finishing maw is kinda weird
[2:24:09] Lucallia: It's not great but it's also not triforce
[2:24:14] Munchables: yeah
[2:24:20] Exedra711: Upgrading to maw is a mistake
[2:24:24] Munchables: yeah i mean just hex is totally fine
[2:24:24] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:24:28] VanidarD: yeah I agree
[2:24:38] Respect_Dat1: the real mistake is building terminus on any champion ever
[2:24:52] captainkrajick: @Respect_Dat1 except Kog
[2:24:55] VanidarD: he doesnt even really have slotpreassure
[2:25:06] Munchables: Cuzz kinda clean with it
[2:25:28] mifot: malig triggers eclipse but muramana doesn't?
[2:25:30] Exedra711: Got ridiculed for it but i thinkthe dmg that malignance and eclipse gives is mkre importantan5 than manamune
[2:25:33] mintyhippo67: terminus is actually decent on gnar
[2:25:34] VanidarD: I always enjoy when Lee is meta
[2:25:57] rilsolo: beryl flash again LuL
[2:26:10] najafan: Monte when they pick Lee, Thresh or Poppy: ***
[2:26:16] commando1814: whose your toplaner you like seeing ?
[2:26:20] maletroll: azir ori however
[2:26:22] kerokerogrips: maglignance procs the eclispe with corki r right?
[2:26:23] VanidarD: just maybe not as a laner lol
[2:26:30] venerablespace: top 5 best designed champs?
[2:26:30] Camer0n000: @commando1814 for me jayce
[2:26:41] Exedra711: I think ori is the most well designed champ ever made
[2:26:41] Lucallia: amazingly fun champions to watch because their skill ceilings are high
[2:26:42] commando1814: @camer0n000 not NA jayce
[2:26:44] Munchables: i acutally really enjoyed the lee mid meta a couple of years ago
[2:26:47] captainkrajick: @venerablespace Jhin
[2:26:47] CrimzsCast: @maletroll azir corki is inherently boring, at least with ori theres some engages and big teamfights
[2:26:52] captainkrajick: @venerablespace Sett imo too
[2:26:53] fljqpy: YIKES
[2:27:01] Camer0n000: @commando1814 not na annything tbf
[2:27:02] fartnugget45: yeah high mobility playmaking without bullshit invuln mechanics. They also get punished for missing abilities which is rare among modern champions
[2:27:04] VanidarD: well evaded by Bull
[2:27:06] captainkrajick: @venerablespace and Pantheon
[2:27:11] fljqpy: pyosik with the TL play
[2:27:13] najafan: corki azar, corki azir, corki azir.
[2:27:18] commando1814: I wish riot would let corki be a mid game and a a sol light lategame champ
[2:27:18] mintyhippo67: @CrimzsCast wait until people figure out you can play tanks mid and you'll see what true hell is like
[2:27:23] VanidarD: cleanses nothing tho
[2:27:24] najafan: One thousand years of corki azir.
[2:27:40] commando1814: @fartnugget45 good ol renekton
[2:27:50] najafan: @mintyhippo67 Rookern is just a hard counter to mages mid atm
[2:27:55] kerokerogrips: who was the old KDF adc?  is he retired now ?
[2:27:57] clmft1: @najafan It's the LoL El Classico
[2:28:02] VanidarD: oh, it was michaels lol
[2:28:08] VanidarD: I didnt even realize
[2:28:11] Sjkaev: LUL
[2:28:16] clmft1: clmft1 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:28:24] VanidarD: oh no that was actually good
[2:28:30] fljqpy: azir got catfished
[2:28:32] VanidarD: he cleansed the maokai ult
[2:28:43] layerr8: layerr8 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! bdd greifed
[2:28:47] najafan: Give me Zoe, Talon, Zed, Fizz. Interesting champs, I swear.
[2:28:48] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo who's the worst and best player on KT?
[2:28:50] gmkoz: "Perfect looks so clueless in team fights
[2:28:55] Giiino: i cant believe people play in windowed
[2:28:56] Respect_Dat1: k'sante CC'd the draven for 3 seconds straight my god...
[2:28:56] CrimzsCast: did bdd get clipped by renata ult?
[2:28:56] commando1814: kled has conditional decent mobility that seems somewhat fair
[2:28:59] najafan: I'm so bored with corki azir.
[2:28:59] lololojsgus: lololojsgus subscribed with Prime. 
[2:29:03] I_love_Zezima: I_love_Zezima subscribed with Prime.

[2:29:18] Exedra711: I love seeing a good corki
[2:29:21] kerokerogrips: do sponsers go HUH when streamers read aloud some very sus subscriber usernames?

[2:29:32] Komarimasita: might be rs3 haha
[2:29:37] Exedra711: Noone punishes first pick azir so im happy corkis back
[2:29:42] VanidarD: honestly, I dont love Corki Azir, who does, but I dont actually have a problem with Corki on his own
[2:29:43] Camer0n000: zezima is a legendary runescape player
[2:29:45] icefever: zezima is runescape faker
[2:29:51] Respect_Dat1: @gmkoz huh?
[2:29:54] najafan: I'm okay with mid kog, we can bring that back.
[2:29:54] gmkoz: yeah I know lol
[2:29:56] I_love_Zezima: zezima is runescape goat
[2:30:00] gmkoz: he just said I don't know what it is and I love it
[2:30:01] najafan: Just, corki azir, dear lord.
[2:30:06] mintyhippo67: corki would be cooler if his carry builds were more viable
[2:30:12] ThatLatvianGuy: zezima PogUU
[2:30:17] CrimzsCast: its bad when team just fp corki
[2:30:28] gmkoz: it is bad when you have a top laner who is a fraud in KT
[2:30:30] WashedxUp222: @I_love_Zezima itswillBoatySwag
[2:30:33] Lucallia: which sponser is going around policing each of their sponseree's streams? xD
[2:30:34] fljqpy: kwang dongers
[2:30:51] najafan: Only if Heimer becomes meta again
[2:30:54] gmkoz: This KT feels very similar to current edition of G2. Good bot lane insane mid lane  an inconsistent jungler and a fraud in top lane
[2:30:55] Exedra711: Dont know why velkos isnt played more especially with the tankier build
[2:31:02] Exedra711: Its so gold effiecient
[2:31:06] najafan: @Exedra711 Literally 0 mobility
[2:31:08] Respect_Dat1: oh god hextech soul with Corki rockets...
[2:31:09] VanidarD: Hextech soul with corki as well
[2:31:18] maletroll: is this game just a hard comp diff
[2:31:22] fartnugget45: KT bot lane is troll as fuck right now tbh
[2:31:23] Exedra711: @najafan dont need it with the tank build
[2:31:30] fljqpy: 20 minutes they never came to top lane
[2:31:32] CrimzsCast: i mean hes not losing them the game, but he isnt doing anything either
[2:31:36] naocorrijo: perfect gets no good picks and no jungle help
[2:31:42] ThatLatvianGuy: even if you are perfect you are no DuDu
[2:31:44] Exedra711: PauseChamp
[2:31:53] mintyhippo67: why are people still defaulting jax into ksante without sunderer
[2:31:56] L1am_Maynee: richerr than kalista XD
[2:32:00] gmkoz: @fartnugget45  but you know Beryl will hypnotize enemy bot lanes to lower their iq  by a solid 100 when the time comes. 3 times world finalist for a reason
[2:32:00] fateofcain: 6 item corki is like Jayce but with rapid fire blast gates
[2:32:02] VanidarD: I dont think Perfect played that bad this game, just kinda did nothing
[2:32:04] HdRecovery: !VODS
[2:32:04] Moobot: @HdRecovery Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:32:05] commando1814: wait Heimer has a bullshit pro viable build ...?! how
[2:32:09] BORED2212: perfect on hle would have been better
[2:32:22] fljqpy: doran is lck champions
[2:32:23] Exedra711: People still arent building liandrys or rift on udyr and it makes me sad
[2:32:25] VanidarD: oh
[2:32:25] Respect_Dat1: kill participation on renata is impressive
[2:32:28] Camer0n000: mickyx might play heimer
[2:32:30] Sjkaev: i even forgot jax was in this game
[2:32:32] CrimzsCast: jax still outscaled
[2:32:35] gmkoz: One would say Beryl has a Kobe like winner quality where no matter how many questionable things he does he is always there in the finals
[2:32:40] VanidarD: jesus
[2:32:44] Sjkaev: wtf
[2:32:45] eetswa76: wtf is that
[2:32:49] fateofcain: BOP
[2:32:50] L1am_Maynee: not even a big one
[2:32:57] eetswa76: true
[2:32:58] Sjkaev: thats bs LUL
[2:33:07] Lucallia: it's so disgusting
[2:33:11] eetswa76: big one did less? o.o
[2:33:11] fateofcain: just filthy
[2:33:15] CrimzsCast: what is malig CD?
[2:33:16] Pergrim: I remember wen nidale spears hit that hard
[2:33:21] gmkoz: as I said Kobe like Beryl :D
[2:33:30] fateofcain: @eetswa76 no hex soul proc
[2:33:30] gmkoz: well he is more like Robert Horry than Kobe
[2:33:33] commando1814: welp that hurts
[2:33:33] BORED2212: i enjoy azir get bullied
[2:33:34] VanidarD: bro this is not okay, the scaling on that pick is bonkers
[2:33:35] Respect_Dat1: @CrimzsCast im not sure there is one... lol
[2:33:47] eetswa76: fair @fateofcain
[2:33:48] clmft1: that is so oppressive
[2:33:49] defiantketchup: I've been out of the loop corki is meta? wtf why's he so good now?
[2:33:54] najafan: This is just Nidalee, yeah
[2:34:09] fartnugget45: its so busted idk why the corki doesnt just go wombo combo first 2 items
[2:34:11] CrimzsCast: its nightharvestor static shiv all over again
[2:34:13] fateofcain: @najafan nah, it's AoE LUL
[2:34:14] ThatLatvianGuy: ult ksante with 2.5k hp LuL
[2:34:14] Sjkaev: and aoe LUL
[2:34:15] Camer0n000: cuzz and andril can probably walk backstage at this point and theyd still win
[2:34:19] VadelmaMeduusa: better nerf irelia
[2:34:20] maletroll: corki is an actual champion outside of hir R too
[2:34:22] layerr8: and it wasn't razor thin skill shot
[2:34:23] Respect_Dat1: and the spears didnt scale with travel distance
[2:34:30] VanidarD: and had the package

[2:34:30] clmft1: When does Perfect get to play the game? Man was cced for 10 years there
[2:34:31] gmkoz: corki is so boring to play against and so boring to play with
[2:34:38] Gondawn: And the spears were faster and bigger hitbox
[2:34:40] Tpro83: Imagine Spears the hit box of Naut Q
[2:34:40] VanidarD: and corki bombs are also aoe
[2:34:41] mintyhippo67: old nidalee q cd was like nothing I think lmao
[2:34:45] Komarimasita: ill be honest as an adc player when i see pyke die I feel nothing
[2:34:49] eetswa76: ICANT
[2:34:53] defiantketchup: jezus
[2:35:07] defiantketchup: O.o
[2:35:08] GPAlexander: @Komarimasita I feel overwhelming joy.
[2:35:09] eetswa76: FACTS @komarimasita
[2:35:14] Exedra711: Void staff
[2:35:16] Komarimasita: exactly rise up adcs
[2:35:19] gmkoz: why do professional teams never surrender? This is legit surrender 0 hope territory
[2:35:28] Exedra711: It should be cryptobloom but whatever
[2:35:30] Respect_Dat1: nidalee spears that are faster, larger, didnt scale with travel distance, and leave an AoE damage rift on hit
[2:35:30] pepsicaralu: BRO WHERE IS IT KT VS HLE 3 MAP?
[2:35:35] gmkoz: seems to just lower down your morale by dying over and over again when there is a game 3 by not surrendering
[2:35:40] najafan: @gmkoz Unprofessional, they get fined
[2:35:41] ThatLatvianGuy: @gmkoz sponsors need their time
[2:35:44] eetswa76: @gmkoz cant ff anymore
[2:35:49] Retsub1: @MonteCristo which champ (or champs), disregarding like overall specific numbers, do you think benefit the most with the new map?
[2:36:04] maletroll: they used to ff in ogn
[2:36:25] gmkoz: yes I remember people surrender in old days
[2:36:29] pepsicaralu: It it replay?
[2:36:37] eetswa76: 😂😂😂
[2:36:38] Retsub1: holy shit the dmg
[2:36:38] fartnugget45: RIOT
[2:36:39] Giiino: what in tarnation
[2:36:40] fateofcain: BOP BOP
[2:36:40] fljqpy: yes this is funny
[2:36:42] CrimzsCast: Why is it so big, wtf
[2:36:44] Respect_Dat1: not. even. the big. rocket...
[2:36:48] lyfjabergen: @MonteCristo Question: How critical do you think casters can/should be. I understand that it isn't possible to just go off on someone like Dom will do live on broadcast but sometimes it feels like casters straight up ignore bad or missplays and throws.
[2:36:54] eetswa76: CORKI TIME
[2:36:59] fateofcain: like WTF do you do vs that? LUL
[2:37:07] GPAlexander: the authentic ADC experience in 2024
[2:37:07] VanidarD: yeah that shit is not okay
[2:37:10] VadelmaMeduusa: Corki has a big package and so do I
[2:37:12] dah777: bull EZ
[2:37:16] CrimzsCast: @lyfjabergen I liked when LS did it. And I do it too.
[2:37:17] mintyhippo67: if 6 item corki with hextech soul didn't do this they should buff him
[2:37:25] kerokerogrips: loved when phreak would roast teams
[2:37:30] xChip102: so is Taeyoon out of a job?
[2:37:34] Exedra711: I would rather they call them out
[2:37:35] Salerodis: “That TP was awful!”
[2:37:38] Exedra711: Like in csgo
[2:37:39] gmkoz: @lyfjabergen  bro BB avoiding criminal charges by being the worst laner of universe for 3 years in a row without getting any criticism by casters
[2:37:40] Komarimasita: yeah if a caster is wrong but they said something its gonna follow them for a long time
[2:37:41] fx_fanslowika: shame its against kt
[2:37:41] L1am_Maynee: cause if ur ever wrong that player will insta clown you on twitter
[2:37:43] santa9907: Honestly this version of corki is super disgutsing but extremely fun to play
[2:37:47] Len_xyz: an upset win that is not part of KC
[2:37:49] pleblurker9: Upset won ? Pog
[2:37:49] fljqpy: its literally echo fox
[2:37:51] najafan: They need to buff Kog so we can have Kog vs Corki again
[2:37:51] awoogawooogawoo: LUL
[2:37:54] fateofcain: LUL
[2:38:03] link3s: link3s subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:38:05] Camer0n000: trymbi be like man targ is so horrible he hit 2/20 arrows and
[2:38:07] BORED2212: thats why LPL is the best, the production highlights bad plays slows them down and zooms in
[2:38:09] Arford: Speaking of casters being wrong, throwback to "Sunfire stole the Baron"
[2:38:10] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo which team in the world has looked the best in the current meta?
[2:38:11] Exedra711: I yearn for thoorin richard absolutely going in on people on desk segments
[2:38:11] najafan: I'm against Corki Azir. I'm VERY in favor of Corki Kog.
[2:38:16] fartnugget45: @najafan kog itemization is so bad atm
[2:38:37] mintyhippo67: ap kog itemization is amazing right now what
[2:38:39] Exedra711: @najafan people just need to learn to punish azir
[2:38:44] lyfjabergen: I can see that, you think that would be different in a hypothetical world in which the average viewer doesnt worship the grounds upon which pro players walk?
[2:38:49] gmkoz: HLE looked lowkey good btw
[2:38:49] CrimzsCast: everyone has a caedral moment , lol
[2:38:53] mintyhippo67: if his ratios weren't gimped to shit ap kog would be thanos
[2:39:07] fljqpy: even costreamers have it wrong
[2:39:11] pepsicaralu: Bro Kt vs Hle 3 map We wait?
[2:39:13] fljqpy: i think its fine
[2:39:24] fljqpy: dont have to be judge judy on the cast
[2:39:27] Lamynator: if you're confidently wrong, you might also just fool the audience into thinking you're right!
[2:39:29] gmkoz: yes one of the mistakes is "LPL is a one-region team" when we saw LCK is a one SKT team :D
[2:39:33] commando1814: don't csgo casters go hard ?

[2:39:56] kingkevin619: alkali open
[2:39:59] BORED2212: @montecristo Are you doing LPL bangers aswell ?
[2:40:04] CrimzsCast: no way to predict azir, -> corki lucian. Impossible
[2:40:14] fljqpy: its harder to be correct while casting a MOBA
[2:40:17] Camer0n000: could we convince the lck to fine zeka if he doesnt pick akali at least once during 14.1
[2:40:26] fartnugget45: @commando1814 csgo doesnt have a billion different champions/abilities and strange interactions. its a little bit easier to be confident
[2:40:28] predrag11: The way Corki ult scales off levels is so crazy
[2:40:29] fljqpy: especially with the visual cluttery of LOL
[2:40:38] Exedra711: Malzahar is never picked, Xerath isnt picked, kog isnt picked
[2:40:50] Exedra711: But i dont blame the teams
[2:41:03] CrimzsCast: oo malphite angle
[2:41:03] commando1814: @fartnugget45 I just know our boy mosses will flame a fool who needs it
[2:41:04] pepsicaralu: Let's look at 3 map Kt against Hle
[2:41:09] ThatLatvianGuy: as much as i find Corki a sleeper, it shows if midlaners/teams are actually good around package timing
[2:41:09] commando1814: and janko
[2:41:13] loaderj: What's your take on modern legend design? do you think they should spend more time fixing older less complex legends? I find it insane that ksante exists but you have all these older legends who havent been touched or changed in years
[2:41:13] Exedra711: Because the patch system incentivises corki azir metas
[2:41:18] BORED2212: @exedra711 kog isnt good right now not sure about others
[2:41:19] fljqpy: wtf
[2:41:20] VanidarD: I dont really like the Nami, but with millio ban I guess they are kinda forced into it
[2:41:25] fljqpy: do the heca
[2:41:29] gmkoz: Jokes aside I really like HLE's chances in making a run in title. People still underrate Peanut for some reason after all these years
[2:41:29] CrimzsCast: udyr jungle, malphite top it was perfect
[2:41:31] fartnugget45: I don't know because I don't play 0 ping, but I feel like Xerath loses a lot of value on zero ping. Probably easy to dodge his stuff
[2:41:34] Camer0n000: did you ever review vitality vs g2
[2:41:49] maletroll: loving watching poppy might be your hottest take
[2:41:55] daokedao: @gmkoz canyon is his kryptonite though..
[2:42:17] Exedra711: @bored2212 its playable id say, its in the same vein as the others and you can build the 2 tank items on him
[2:42:33] gmkoz: but Peanut was the Chovy whisperer where Chovy was doing correct macro things first time in his life and transitioning his lead to his team's success
[2:42:34] commando1814: @maletroll cause monte want a giant ass hammer to smack a fool irl
[2:42:39] Exedra711: On this patch at least
[2:42:40] CrimzsCast: Is udyr not a viable flex jungle?
[2:42:47] fljqpy: i love poppy
[2:43:00] mintyhippo67: udyr is probably technically a 3 way flex
[2:43:05] Deskop123: when does rekkles play
[2:43:10] BORED2212: peanut poppy especially
[2:43:11] fljqpy: one of the first to get %hp dmg
[2:43:12] commando1814: probably the gm for the broncos with that Russel Wilson contract
[2:43:12] mintyhippo67: but people won't draft around that they just blind him
[2:43:12] riley_bruce_: its actually exciting and there is counterplay - rare
[2:43:16] kerokerogrips: love that sloppy poppy
[2:43:23] daokedao: @gmkoz and now they praise him and telling him well done in comes after he successfully shotcalled vs t1
[2:43:23] fartnugget45: I miss the old poppy one shots
[2:43:28] gmkoz: Rekless had very first 3 games to be honest I didn't watch if he had any other
[2:43:31] lyfjabergen: It's really cool how she transitions from a bully early to a protective wall later in the game
[2:43:32] daokedao: comms*
[2:43:36] gmkoz: very good first 3 games_
[2:43:36] pleblurker9: Sheeeeesh
[2:43:39] Deskop123: im sorry for asking brother
[2:43:44] mifot: there was a brief period of poppy having a really cringe build, but otherwise i love poppy
[2:43:44] predrag11: Its kinda funny watching his Top and Jungle run him down mercilessly
[2:43:45] sillycoomer69: the academy kid Kappa
[2:43:45] tmihee: @gmkoz canyon has been losing to peanut for the last 2 years bro
[2:43:46] lyfjabergen: Really cool since it requires two different playstyles basically
[2:43:52] commando1814: @lyfjabergen anyone else that can do that
[2:43:54] Riqui__: monte rather spends his time on the pro leagues such as LCS
[2:43:56] fljqpy: this is a bangers only stream kappa
[2:43:56] Camer0n000: saying watch rekkless is the new dom pls watch ljl
[2:44:12] CrimzsCast: lucian nami about to lose prio lvl 1
[2:44:17] fljqpy: rest of the world and T1
[2:44:18] riley_bruce_: idk if I would consider LEC and LCS tier 1
[2:44:18] gmkoz: Canyon gapped Peanut so hard it was the biggest jungle gap in history in early game yet he still lost lol
[2:44:22] notbaltej: shrek > casablanca
[2:44:27] mintyhippo67: double scorch lucian nami to  never win lane phase is my personal cancer
[2:44:33] Arford: Isn't KR Challenger's the one below Academy so it's T3?

[2:44:50] najafan: @BORED2212 They actually reverted a lot of the old AP kog nerfs, looking at the history of the champ. I think with just a few buffs the champ might be workable.
[2:45:00] najafan: Not quite yet, but close.
[2:45:07] gmkoz: ap kog can never work unless your team is 500x stronger than opponents
[2:45:09] BORED2212: what rekkles is doing would be interesting if it were some young eu prodigy
[2:45:21] gmkoz: in this age of league a mid lane champ should be able to have some escape tools
[2:45:24] mifot: is teleport naut new technology or is this guy too smart?
[2:45:25] theancientdreamer: @montecristo HLE will win the split
[2:45:28] daokedao: @gmkoz yes, chovy did amazing plays, ruler played insanely well with lehends yummi on him, it was an amazing team. can peanut pull it off with arguably a worse team vs a team that is getting to be almost as good at shotcalling ?
[2:45:35] riley_bruce_: damn!
[2:45:39] CrimzsCast: when your tank jungle kills your carry jungle smh
[2:45:39] direpants2: what a flash
[2:45:43] xonsa: no support item on fox? how does this work
[2:45:43] VanidarD: peanut putting Willer in the dumbster
[2:45:45] fljqpy: ahh yes invade the viego, why doesnt everybody do that
[2:45:50] Camer0n000: good ol tim bitd
[2:45:53] Camer0n000: tim bits
[2:45:54] riley_bruce_: every solo q players worst nightmare
[2:45:56] pepsicaralu: Kadoshh
[2:46:00] mintyhippo67: @gmkoz you don't need escape when your r has 1800 range
[2:46:11] fljqpy: hes getting BLASTED by the red buff LUL
[2:46:15] dah777: HUH
[2:46:16] mintyhippo67: if kog's ratios are good and he doesn't go down 50 cs in lane phase he is automatically viable
[2:46:16] ace_alchemist: huh
[2:46:18] commando1814: bonk
[2:46:22] Respect_Dat1: Stare what....
[2:46:25] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo who's the best jungler in LCK
[2:46:28] riley_bruce_: FeelsWeirdMan getting nasty in the jgl
[2:46:28] gmkoz: kog in mid lane is automatic target for jungle
[2:46:33] Exedra711: We love poppy in this chat
[2:46:34] tmihee: FeelsWeirdMan
[2:46:36] Komarimasita: to be fair,  Peanut's poppy hits different
[2:46:38] xonsa: old splash art gives nightmares
[2:46:38] Riqui__: FeelsWeirdMan
[2:46:39] fljqpy: 90.5%
[2:46:40] Exedra711: Dudettes
[2:46:42] lyfjabergen: Listening to Monte talk dirty while on an all nighter working on my masters thesis - what a fcking day
[2:46:42] commando1814: what's a yord hole
[2:46:42] a226612345: He keep this style from previous season
[2:46:43] CrimzsCast: Never forget
[2:46:45] sillycoomer69: 90.5 HUH
[2:46:46] lightheadtv: thats a nice yordhole
[2:46:47] Lemarc7: that's so fucking cursed
[2:46:50] Riqui__: Is Monte just Dantes in disguise?
[2:46:51] PRO_TAGe: Yord Hole?
[2:46:55] PRO_TAGe: there's 2?
[2:46:57] riley_bruce_: FeelsWeirdMan She was all over viego
[2:46:59] fljqpy: no thats not lollypoppy
[2:47:00] Adanion: Ahh yes, my favourite subject
[2:47:02] notbaltej: going to costream lck???
[2:47:05] immexd: why didnt the naut start support item?
[2:47:17] mintyhippo67: @gmkoz once kog is 6 he can play 500 light years back from ganks and the lane changes make it even easier to stay safe lmao
[2:47:18] Respect_Dat1: ApuApustaja why
[2:47:20] fljqpy: know your skins smh
[2:47:22] DreamRL_: Is Farming Senna with no support item (on either Senna nor support) actually good?
[2:47:26] Camer0n000: peanut on poppy basically has the opposite win rate as saken does in the lec
[2:47:32] DreamRL_: Neither*
[2:47:39] commando1814: does Gnar have a yord hole
[2:47:39] ruiva: From classics to yordholes.  Quite the range.
[2:47:53] DreamRL_: Aah
[2:48:01] fljqpy: naut prolly will buy supp item later
[2:48:05] BORED2212: lck bot lanes are so much better than west at stacking 3rd wave for dive
[2:48:14] lyfjabergen: Where is our friend the classics phd, really looking forward to his nuanced take on the Yordholes
[2:48:14] Riqui__: hahaha
[2:48:15] VanidarD: peanut...
[2:48:16] Komarimasita: LMAO
[2:48:18] VanidarD: a bit too far
[2:48:27] Komarimasita: its been a while that i couldnt stop myself from laughing out loud
[2:48:35] CrimzsCast: delight can start it yea
[2:48:36] VanidarD: good flash by Hena there tho
[2:48:38] kerokerogrips: wth am i watching lcs rn ?
[2:48:39] riley_bruce_: targamas core right here
[2:48:42] dr3amboiz: playing lucian into senna feels so rough
[2:48:45] mintyhippo67: if you want to force this you should play an actual kill lane instead of lucian nami
[2:48:51] maaarcus22: Delight kinda Targamas'd it but yeah great play by Hena
[2:49:00] sillycoomer69: nice flash
[2:49:01] fljqpy: no theres no way delight could
[2:49:05] riley_bruce_: he got targamas'd
[2:49:13] Adanion: If it werent for DoAs brain we would have never broached the glory that is the Yordhole, never forget
[2:49:21] Gondawn: What's that you're eating?
[2:49:23] gryfix: @MonteCristo peanut has aggro cuz of red buff
[2:49:27] najafan: @mintyhippo67 It looks like his E and R ratios are as good as they've ever been. I think mana costs and some other stuff isn't ideal, but he's actually in a *decent* state. With just a little bit of work I think he's viable.
[2:49:39] notbaltej: thoughts on kt PerfecT?

[2:49:45] maaarcus22: Peanut took aggro because of the W damage
[2:49:54] gryfix: thanks :)
[2:49:57] daokedao: brendan says it on replay
[2:50:11] gryfix: @MonteCristo agreed
[2:50:13] maaarcus22: Oh it was already aggro'd before the W my bad
[2:50:37] daokedao: @notbaltej need to see him lane vs zeus,kiin but he looks good
[2:50:39] DarthUnleashed: I miss you and Doa casting in league man..
[2:50:41] fljqpy: they defended the dive really well
[2:50:44] kerokerogrips: will yamatos reputation sink because of this KC split
[2:50:47] Clonar_Gaming: hey
[2:50:57] CrimzsCast: @kerokerogrips alot of people do blame him
[2:51:02] MonteCristo: !culture

[2:51:03] kerokerogrips: @DarthUnleashed Monte's going to tell you , you can hear him on this twitch vods and LFN videos
[2:51:12] fljqpy: unlike other botlanes that would just wait for death
[2:51:26] Exedra711: And watch the baldurs gate vods
[2:51:27] mintyhippo67: does peanut troll and finish his sunfire first
[2:51:31] notbaltej: @kerokerogrips my opinion on yamatos ability has not changed since the kc incidents
[2:51:39] theancientdreamer: @montecristo imagine this team with a top lamer like Zeus or Kiin
[2:51:40] Adanion: Rebel Moon, everyones favourite new franchise :)
[2:51:47] A_MericanPelican: Any plans to include books in Nerd Legion?
[2:52:23] fljqpy: top lamer zoos
[2:52:44] Jethro_F22: @notbaltej You're probably a reasonable human being though. Most league fans are mouth-breathing mongoloids
[2:52:52] A_MericanPelican: Makes sense - I’ll keep working on that lol
[2:53:00] VanidarD: man, I love seeing Vipers Lucian mechanics, he is so smoothe with it
[2:53:01] Adanion: It was something about cannibalism that somehow merged into cross breads and breeding with Yordles Meglins etc
[2:53:07] Komarimasita: i had a really hard time getting into books then i started audiobooks during my daily commute and have read so much
[2:53:26] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips same
[2:53:31] lyfjabergen: IT'S SAFE
[2:53:39] maletroll: willer is a beautiful fellow
[2:53:42] Respect_Dat1: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:53:46] maletroll: no homo
[2:53:48] kosstossa: WutFace a what now
[2:53:51] Adanion: And yeah the GIMP yordle in Arcane sparked it into overdrive
[2:53:52] stephcurrysim: whys that the first thing i hear when i open this stream
[2:53:53] BORED2212: good to know riot is focused on the right things
[2:53:58] lyfjabergen: Riot will never beat the allegations huh?
[2:54:00] fljqpy: GIMP WutFace
[2:54:12] CrimzsCast: AHH riot always so family friendly, with their brothels.
[2:54:15] fljqpy: GIMP skin when
[2:54:17] dr3amboiz: hear me out
[2:54:19] Arford: Why did you tell us this
[2:54:24] maletroll: dantes
[2:54:27] PRO_TAGe: No no Yordle can't have sex but they can BDSM
[2:54:28] mifot: maybe she's just the business owner
[2:54:32] Pergrim: some sexual fantasys do not need penetration tho
[2:54:33] noyea96: Who has sex with yordles?
[2:54:39] noyea96: what did i miss

[2:54:43] lyfjabergen: GnarDSM skin when
[2:54:52] kerokerogrips: @noyea96 same people who co star with baby alien
[2:55:05] mintyhippo67: what's depressing about arcane is that they hired katie leung to do an english accent for caitlyn
[2:55:09] fljqpy: top lane is just 1v1 tourney now
[2:55:18] BORED2212: we got yordle brothels  and gambling sponsors but graves cant have a cigar
[2:55:18] Lucallia: I went to brush my teeth and came back to BDSM Yordle...?? ಠ_ಠ
[2:55:18] mintyhippo67: where is my scottish caitlyn
[2:55:21] najafan: @lyfjabergen I don't think he has good boundaries.
[2:55:46] notbaltej: @mintyhippo67 they shouldve just got chris pratt
[2:55:57] lyfjabergen: The rage bar makes him go drom sub to dom
[2:56:01] fljqpy: so maybe ADC in the toplane is viable
[2:56:22] CrimzsCast: Dragon stacking still seems to be the way to win
[2:56:25] mintyhippo67: @notbaltej to be fair the jayce va is basically just chris pratt lite
[2:56:35] najafan: @lyfjabergen But semi-randomly.
[2:56:50] Komarimasita: IMO if you already have at least 2 grubs to deny the other team 5+ its pretty low prio
[2:57:02] najafan: That's just an anger issue.
[2:57:17] Adanion: Remember guys, Riot makes champs out of IRL people they are obsessed with, so its perfectly acceptable to add GIMP yordles into their universe
[2:57:17] CrimzsCast: OR PICK MALPHITE
[2:57:29] Gondawn: frozen heart currently the best item in league overall?
[2:57:32] BORED2212: @montecristo how much should teams priorities voidgrubs? or is it drafted dependant?
[2:57:47] CrimzsCast: @Gondawn Still has crazy efficiency
[2:57:51] najafan: @Adanion Runeterra Elon Musk when?
[2:57:52] mintyhippo67: these junglers should be delaying sunfire completion and rushing the busted tank items off bamis
[2:57:57] Respect_Dat1: the hell is that udyr skin... lol
[2:57:58] fljqpy: doran the unchanging
[2:58:10] dah777: udyr shields ResidentSleeper
[2:58:48] Lucallia: @najafan I thought that's what Renata is
[2:59:03] CrimzsCast: Winning top lane, win 3vs3 topside, do you have splitpushing all determine if you can voidgrub
[2:59:05] fljqpy: no renata is the warren buffet of esports
[2:59:33] najafan: @Lucallia Oh, but he hates gender swaps, they're woke.
[2:59:55] Lucallia: too bad for him then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[3:00:39] Nymaera_: howdy
[3:01:02] najafan: @Nymaera_ So what are your thoughts on AP Kog as a Corki counter?
[3:01:15] Nymaera_: nah not today
[3:01:15] LordAnomandaris: Auxs accent is so thick
[3:01:23] najafan: The chat is conflicted.
[3:01:34] Nymaera_: AP Kog is good until package comes up
[3:01:36] fljqpy: ap kog <3
[3:02:00] Nymaera_: then he can suffer a bit, also AP Kog can never side lane, Corki sometimes can
[3:02:07] loaderj: @MonteCristo what keeps you interested in league after all these years? especially considering the amount of attention to detail you put into reviews like this
[3:02:10] Gondawn: Will riot accept that corki will always be pro scewed with package and just remove it?
[3:02:28] fljqpy: they should rework kog W to make him a turret
[3:02:29] mintyhippo67: is trinity viego really the play here
[3:02:34] captainkrajick: @Gondawn August said they're looking into reworking Corki out of package
[3:02:35] fljqpy: like old xerath ability
[3:02:36] goof_trooper: goof_trooper subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hyped for Bangers Only season
[3:02:40] Nymaera_: I think August said Corki probably will get package removed at some point
[3:02:49] Gondawn: @captainkrajick Took them a while, but good change
[3:02:52] najafan: @fljqpy They did, it was utterly busted.
[3:02:54] Respect_Dat1: how the hell does nautlius have 101 cs
[3:03:03] fljqpy: @najafan ye i loved it
[3:03:10] VanidarD: Lucian is for sure in the gold penalty zone right now
[3:03:13] haroony123: cant wait for geng vs genh
[3:03:17] theancientdreamer: @montecristo I know it’s a stupid question, but how can’t  riot find out who is giving you guys all these informations about the company’s fuck ups?
[3:03:19] fljqpy: but give him like resists too
[3:03:23] daokedao: @MonteCristo geng vs t1 did that on first week gave up the voidbugs, chovy shotcalling it
[3:03:43] Exedra711: Nymaera have you seen the tankier velkos build? I think kog can build the rookern and frozen heart and be serviceable in sides
[3:03:46] fljqpy: unless riot has brain scanner lol
[3:03:48] najafan: Are they gonna bug their phones?
[3:03:49] Lucallia: As much as I love Bangers only the autopsy yesterday was also fun
[3:03:55] VanidarD: someone always talks dude, they have good people in that company
[3:04:03] Nymaera_: ah yeah Lux can do that too @exedra711
[3:04:04] VanidarD: its like EG, at the end everyone wanted to talk
[3:04:05] mintyhippo67: how is kog fitting in rookern he is so item dependent
[3:04:15] Gondawn: @theancientdreamer They did find out. Why do you think 11% were fired? Kappa
[3:04:27] Nymaera_: oh for sure plenty of people talk about stuff in the hopes it eventually works it’s way out
[3:04:29] najafan: Kog absolutely cannot do that
[3:04:30] loaderj: its a small indy company
[3:04:36] loaderj: what do you mean
[3:04:41] zhyrin: how is fox botlane sharing farm so perfectly
[3:04:48] fljqpy: herald should be buffed
[3:05:00] ThatLatvianGuy: riot 5Head idea was asking reddit mods to ask for sources of journalists i imagine

[3:05:01] captainkrajick: Herald should take full turret tbh
[3:05:05] mintyhippo67: rookern galio is probably pretty good though
[3:05:10] captainkrajick: @ThatLatvianGuy iwdRun
[3:05:15] loaderj: riot utterly destroyed LCS, they should be ashamed how brutally pathetic and boring NA league is right now
[3:05:17] ThatLatvianGuy: captainkrajick wawa
[3:05:18] fljqpy: u have to commit with the herald, but it oneshots a turret
[3:05:22] captainkrajick: wawa
[3:05:30] Gondawn: @ThatLatvianGuy pankoshitter would probably make some shit up if they did that
[3:05:47] koreanwonderboy1: insane hook
[3:05:58] Gondawn: EU SUPPORT PogUU
[3:06:02] koreanwonderboy1: how did his team not kill him???? wtf
[3:06:03] mintyhippo67: kinda weird to not just dash backwards tbh
[3:06:04] Lucallia: the foresight hook
[3:06:32] Double_Hitt: I wanna see HLE vs T1 so bad
[3:06:35] lyfjabergen: Lord Zeka is in world beater form again I tell you
[3:06:36] theancientdreamer: @montecristo Viper or Ruler?
[3:06:39] VanidarD: that was a mega hook, looked like the longest anchor in the world
[3:06:45] Gondawn: eu should import more of their sups to kr
[3:06:50] Gondawn: export*
[3:06:52] fljqpy: DK pls be good this year 🙏
[3:06:59] fljqpy: seems like 5th place
[3:07:07] VanidarD: that was all delight tho
[3:07:13] VanidarD: so well played
[3:07:22] BORED2212: clear could have killed viper maybe but he autos peanut
[3:07:28] captainkrajick: half lucky half wp also
[3:07:40] captainkrajick: You should see Decade @MonteCristo
[3:07:41] fljqpy: udyr is such a good champ for doran
[3:07:45] fljqpy: he can just go ham
[3:07:46] Komarimasita: oh my god what is udyr
[3:07:47] koreanwonderboy1: Clear didnt auto Viper so viper lived in the previous exchange
[3:07:48] captainkrajick: on LGD
[3:07:52] addaberry: Udyr go vroom
[3:08:06] gryfix: Clear was great in LCK CL, I hope he will become next good LCK top
[3:08:14] maletroll: i swear they all go urf corki because the R is so hard to see
[3:08:24] Xoomboii: Xoomboii subscribed with Prime.

[3:09:12] captainkrajick: rage play

[3:11:50] mintyhippo67: if viego was ivern this game might be playable
[3:11:50] Komarimasita: i was pretty sad when peanut left T1 i felt like there was a lot of potential there

[3:14:05] VanidarD: and HLE has soul, thats a lot of gold value right there
[3:14:06] Komarimasita: yeah the corki comp with that much frontline its doomed
[3:14:14] Nymaera_: that’s the build
[3:14:22] sillycoomer69: he is too powerful
[3:14:27] Nymaera_: also idk if he has ingenious hunter
[3:14:37] Respect_Dat1: the camera guys doing work lmao... every rocket is a zoom in is funny as hell

[3:15:22] Nymaera_: Jesus the Corki damage onto Azir
[3:15:25] Komarimasita: this is like me queueing normals with the boys, make 1 play and instantly lose the game
[3:15:26] CrimzsCast: @theancientdreamer maybe on average, them or support. But sometimes someone like doinb comes along
[3:15:27] BORED2212: @theancientdreamer not if your willer
[3:15:32] TheJMZ: Jungle as a position lends itself to be a shotcaller.
[3:15:37] VanidarD: good junglers, yes
[3:15:41] heeman1119: that fact that the casters get chastized for calling them fox is so triggering LUL
[3:15:42] Exedra711: I think mid laners

[3:15:45] fljqpy: they are the supports yes
[3:15:58] Angel777: games seems doomed tbh they need to engage on hle to deal with the poke but they have no way to engage on that comp seems like draft gap
[3:15:59] fljqpy: junglers are just roaming supports
[3:16:15] unkn0wnm1: Zekan LUL
[3:16:16] Slayerz44: do you think HLE was winning based off draft alone
[3:16:19] Nymaera_: casual 5.5k damage
[3:16:40] Angel777: no they sememed to be playing better from the bit a saw at the end
[3:17:05] Exedra711: Nymaera what do you think about foregoing manamune early and just sit on tear and get eclipse malignance as fast as possible
[3:17:20] fljqpy: change support items so that supports can roam more
[3:19:01] mintyhippo67: @fljqpy nah
[3:19:33] goof_trooper: Monte doesn't know Twitch meta, you need to turn and show your butt whenever you rise from your chair, otherwise how do you expect to get subs

[3:22:43] Exedra711: Phil choi did an incredibke job

[3:23:18] BORED2212: bring back dfg and give lb her silence back. most broken shit ever
[3:23:28] Exedra711: Bring back wriggles lantern
[3:23:29] Angel777: unless kalista is so op and absolutely stomps in all 3 lanes and your team can play that seems very problematic as a first pick to easy to layer around
[3:23:33] Angel777: ap yi was goat
[3:23:39] Goreng: also bring back the old rune system, the one where you have to buy each "node"
[3:23:45] vriesea97: bring back old urgot with the wacky ulti
[3:23:53] Exedra711: 1% crit runes

[3:23:58] najafan: And trackers
[3:24:14] Exedra711: Movespeed quints
[3:24:18] najafan: @Goreng God no, that was horrible for new players
[3:24:21] Exedra711: Good times
[3:24:29] mintyhippo67: this is functionally a counter engage comp with kalista that gets out ranged
[3:24:32] lyfjabergen: Alright it's getting late - almost 9 am, have a nice day lads and good night
[3:24:36] mintyhippo67: red side has to win in 15 minutes or they are turbo fucked
[3:24:38] Krethas: Monte, you and Thoorin talk about player personal skill a lot, going as far as ranking them. Do you feel like LoL "hides" personal skill as a team game, or do amazing team chemistry plays make the ceiling higher?
[3:24:55] Anzlan: @lyfjabergen gn
[3:25:03] ohsomagical_: is that echo fox in the LCK ?
[3:25:29] Exedra711: @krethas its like soccer in a way, it is a team game but just doing your job is not enough sometimes, you need individual skills

[3:26:10] ohsomagical_: that was really cool
[3:26:24] Krethas: Yeah plays like this peanut play are exactly what I mean - it's "personal skill" to do that flash block, but expressed in a kind of "team awareness" way
[3:26:34] Anzlan: bring back top trinity Nid
[3:27:20] 0rz0_: 0rz0_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:27:48] mintyhippo67: i still want riot to make mid lane into an actual 1v1 lane again - these map changes are a step in the right direction
[3:27:57] mintyhippo67: mid lane has had so many boring match ups for so long
[3:28:00] najafan: Also how is Fox ever gonna engage? Is it just gonna be Lee dives?
[3:28:02] mintyhippo67: its criminal
[3:28:25] captainkrajick: Dom can play Udyr better xdd
[3:28:25] 0rz0_: ty for providing all the content across LFN, makes my closing shifts at target a bit more bearable
