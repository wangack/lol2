[0:49:19] PrayWMe: !thinking
[0:49:19] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.

[1:25:48] surely_not_faker: !Thinking
[1:25:48] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.

[2:12:24] 1DavyJones_: !aatrox
[2:12:25] Nightbot: just stay in ur wave so it pushes to u when he qs u. wait for them to use their passive on a minion. Dodge the sweetspots it worth cancelling an auto dodge. Once you get hull just push ignore him and hit tower.
[2:12:29] IAmFakerNoCapFrFr: i mean. i hate facing trundle as well but jesus monkaChrist
[2:12:41] Person_Zero: i like the new hydra effect ngl
[2:12:46] DorinLOL1: @ezziny i kinda understand them because it's pretty annoying that u cant do shit to a trundle
[2:12:49] MrMcJohnson: skill issue
[2:12:57] Otisen98: ez split push
[2:12:59] DorinLOL1: its the frustration thing
[2:13:00] jernftw: !darius
[2:13:00] Nightbot: just outscale (you win lvl 1 and 6)
[2:13:04] flashgoat1: 5 seconds for turret
[2:13:05] AsdanXX: !Nasus
[2:13:05] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists
[2:13:08] MrMcJohnson: baron trundle said STAND PROUD TURRET YOU ARE STRONG
[2:13:09] ezziny: @ezziny you don't wish death upon someone for doing something allowed in a GAME bro
