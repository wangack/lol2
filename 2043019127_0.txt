[1:28:17] xcalebur: hows he getting on with it
[1:28:29] wildriftboi1: why do i always tune in late Madge
[1:28:31] ashuyoxoxo: he beat the guardian ape twice i htink
[1:28:32] xcalebur: ya im friends with both jack and saku

[1:28:40] ashuyoxoxo: he is at the father boss
[1:28:50] xcalebur: oh isnt that one hard as fuck?
[1:28:52] xcalebur: first time at least
[1:29:01] ashuyoxoxo: yeah
[1:29:10] xcalebur: ive seen a lot of no hit runs die to that boss
[1:29:30] xcalebur: hanql ezreal
[1:29:30] wildriftboi1: q buffs OMEGALUL
[1:29:41] ashuyoxoxo: graves invading into die combo
[1:30:01] SerJe: So u skip manamune?
[1:30:07] LoL_habby: no tear
[1:30:10] xcalebur: no hes going manamune
[1:30:17] xcalebur: essence - mana - navori - sf
[1:30:27] ashuyoxoxo: i like shojin more than navori ngl
[1:30:40] randmstring: tear longsword refillable coulda worked I guess
[1:30:47] SerJe: Er cycloswlrd serylda seems not bad actually
[1:30:52] Filthy_Ningen: Any specific reason why he's not going into trinity route ?
[1:31:04] xcalebur: damage
[1:31:07] Aconiic: trinity is ass
[1:31:14] ashuyoxoxo: trinity is not ass
[1:31:21] Mbgz: trinity is more dmg untill like 30 min
[1:31:23] Filthy_Ningen: trinity was bis for like 2-3 patches
[1:31:27] xcalebur: trinity shojin is another build
[1:31:34] Filthy_Ningen: And I didn't see any changes to it too
[1:31:38] xcalebur: s14 trinity is not s13 trinity
[1:31:42] xcalebur: the item is worse now
[1:31:46] Aconiic: they removed the three fold passive
[1:31:46] ashuyoxoxo: yeah but its not bad
[1:31:47] Filthy_Ningen: Oh yeah, true
[1:31:49] Aconiic: so it is much worse
[1:31:51] ashuyoxoxo: compared to pre mythic
[1:31:52] rases00: could you skip manamune if you go for er? You could move into shojin faster that way
[1:31:54] ashuyoxoxo: it is really good
[1:31:58] Mbgz: imo they have to reduce cost abit. i know its a meme 3333 number but still
[1:31:59] ashuyoxoxo: and there u buiild it aswell
[1:32:03] Mbgz: make its 3133
[1:32:04] LoL_habby: I trust dragdar and he stopped building trinity so something must have happened xdd
[1:32:08] ashuyoxoxo: and having attack speed and hp is not bad
[1:32:13] ashuyoxoxo: that build is way more forgiviign
[1:32:14] CompassionateComrade: it was indeed a good bard
[1:32:22] ashuyoxoxo: and usually in soloq tankyness>dmg
[1:32:22] xcalebur: when i was watching dragdar yday he was going trinity
[1:32:30] LoL_habby: rly?
[1:32:31] xcalebur: he was doing trinity manamune shojin
[1:32:37] Lundarien: trinity is fine, just depends on what you're after
[1:32:41] Lundarien: trinity + shojin = tanky ez
[1:32:50] LoL_habby: i saw only ER manamune navori
[1:32:51] Lundarien: ER navori = glasscannon
[1:32:57] xcalebur: but this champ has like 5 builds i swear
[1:33:01] xcalebur: and theyre all decent/good
[1:33:10] ashuyoxoxo: didnt u have q?
[1:33:17] ashuyoxoxo: u could have sheen auto maybe
[1:33:50] Lundarien: I'd argue that in current oneshot-meta ER+navori is better, the extra hp from tri+shojin won't ever save you from the oneshot burst anyways
[1:34:30] Lundarien: might as well join the big dmg gang and just blast them before they blast you KEKW
[1:34:34] tarcuts: how come you play Ez?
[1:34:35] Filthy_Ningen: idk, i don't play ez at all, im abusing lethality mf
[1:34:59] Mbgz: adc is gone. you play ads
[1:34:59] xcalebur: ez was buffed this patch tarcuts
[1:35:19] wildriftboi1: OK

[1:35:30] xcalebur: ye ez is really good
[1:35:30] ashuyoxoxo: now
[1:35:32] Flamebooi: If u have time, look bro vs geng.  Cuz naut supp started with dshield
[1:35:39] xcalebur: they buffed 3 of his spells
[1:36:22] ashuyoxoxo: think actually hardest adc with kalista
[1:36:22] tarcuts: interesting
[1:36:25] Flamebooi: And now aph adc bought supp item hmmm
[1:36:35] wildriftboi1: @ashuyoxoxo 100% its ez
[1:36:38] musiclover81: when u went for kill on elise was it flash e or e flash happened too fast for me
[1:36:45] LapisLazulies: @Jackspektra when/if you have time id really like to know your thoughts on the build/opinions in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMTcCVn441w&t=124s&pp=ygUJZGRhbmcgYWRj
[1:36:54] Dragdar: Spektra Ez I prayed for times like these
[1:36:58] wildriftboi1: kalista is more of positioning and knowing dmg but ezreal has a lot more going for him to learn
[1:37:09] xcalebur: hope youre feeling better today dragdar <3
[1:37:24] Lundarien: he's chugging cokes instead of water
[1:37:44] xcalebur: @LapisAoki better to ask when hes not in game boss

[1:38:54] thechildofnight: jayce from arcane?
[1:38:54] wildriftboi1: why man
[1:39:11] Dragdar: If you feel like a gigachad and don't want to go maw this game, lowkey try ER > MM > Navori > Shadowflame
[1:39:13] spartalon117: what is the best ADC against Mundo?
[1:39:15] Dragdar: I swear it fucks
[1:39:16] SerJe: @dragdar isnt lethality varus ezreals nm 1 counter?

[1:40:29] wildriftboi1: fissss
[1:40:36] Dragdar: Other ADCs your skill defines the matchup
[1:40:40] wildriftboi1: OMG
[1:40:43] thechildofnight: @kiritsugoi_ blowing your nose is idiot activity?
[1:40:57] wildriftboi1: what are team doings??
[1:41:12] thechildofnight: how have the games been today?
[1:41:18] Lundarien: both teams tunnel the enemy ADC, as always
[1:41:18] Geeving: its ok i'm just having a mental breakdown but its ok
[1:41:20] Lundarien: it is known
[1:41:21] SerJe: Dragdar what do you think about cycloswlrd 3rd? It transitions well into serylda
[1:41:23] shaavola: Fish is most difficult assassin to play and has the most counterplay
[1:41:42] wildriftboi1: LUL
[1:42:03] wildriftboi1: they are making every champ so volatile

[3:49:48] rhubarbnstrawbs: Mostly speculation of plagiarism of many of the existing pokemon models. Shapes and such of the "pals" look to be almost too similar to already existing pokemon.

[5:26:45] clear117: we are not lethality enjoyers?
[5:27:04] wildriftboi1: they are recommending last items as first items ICANT
[5:27:06] Bakii_Hanma: Jhin the fast INSANECAT
[5:27:11] Mir3L_EUNE: Butno dmg hehe

[5:27:17] memerativo: you do damage to their mental
[5:27:23] memerativo: zooming as sonic
[5:27:28] Mir3L_EUNE: Good one
[5:27:28] wildriftboi1: zilean + ms rune + celerity (imagine)
[5:27:35] peybol9: thats the way they nerf lethality, not suggesting it
[5:28:30] clear117: i mean since the item rework and crit adcs taking less zeal items, MS has felt like a massive issue for the role imo
[5:29:17] jokerfeverpro: thoughts on the storm, kraken & shiv changes?
[5:29:17] OGNoha: not possible
[5:29:17] ADCPurple: hello hello jackl
[5:29:19] iampilgrim23: why arent u playing lethality jhhiin
[5:29:19] wildriftboi1: THE Fast only looks 4th shot crit
[5:29:22] wildriftboi1: with move speed
[5:29:38] ADCPurple: bc lethality jhin is for cucks
[5:29:44] Bakii_Hanma: Fast Jhin just need road monkaSTEER
[5:29:55] presuto_: show runes
[5:29:59] Sakadia: Why did you not take a plate after the kills there? (Sry lowbob question) :D
[5:30:00] wildriftboi1: @jokerfeverpro he quickly talked abt it and said that they are nerfs - expressed that dmg is too much with ap as well
[5:30:13] iampilgrim23: i like this one bvetter too, im sad lethality is in the game
[5:30:21] ADCPurple: lethality adc = cuks
[5:30:22] iampilgrim23: was just hoping this was better
[5:30:25] ADCPurple: i am mod so i am right
[5:30:40] wildriftboi1: @ADCPurple :( im a cuck then
[5:30:45] Sakadia: Alright thanks for the clarification :)
[5:30:49] ADCPurple: crit = less dmg, less win rate but giga chad
[5:31:11] ADCPurple: true stroy i am riot api (i got laid off)
