[5:33:13] Pathyul: Smite is a targeted summoner spell that deals true damage to minions, player pets or neutral creeps. It is generally used for jungling, quicker pushing, and/or a source of gold, usually in lower levels. It can be used to 'steal' jungle monsters from the opposing team's jungle by last hitting them and to have a secure method to last hit a high priority jungle target like Baron Nashor or Dragon. Make sure to look at how much damage your smite does and time the smite correctly.
