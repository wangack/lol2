[1:25:40] FioriSpezzati: @mrking0920 xddd
[1:25:42] BeginAndInfinity: @dzukill could it be caused by the fact that yone blinks slightly earlier to enemies before proccing cc part of ulti so sett have brief moment of time to buffer his ult?
[1:25:45] 67se: Pepega Sett flash
[1:25:53] Muffin72: Jamgie
[1:25:54] ShapelessTV: yes but after you dodged with E he could just walk away, he reengaged with R cuz he tilted
[1:25:54] soleantude: then play it and get chall too mothertrucker
