[1:43:53] auri_sariel: or rather the olaf incident
[1:47:18] Mavvrix: Is udyr easy to pilot? Lets say wukong type
[1:47:24] auri_sariel: you just got bambied
[1:47:37] auri_sariel: @Mavvrix Dom said he is an easy to play champ but hard to master
[1:47:47] criticala: Let's gooooooooo
[1:47:54] criticala: rank 1 today
[1:48:10] Mavvrix: @auri_sariel Thats reasonable , similar to renekton
[1:48:29] lubemila: what rank now?
[1:49:14] auri_sariel: @Mavvrix he said that u need to have a really good judgement to use Udyr properly, like anyone can play him, but its hard to master him to a point where u solo carry
[1:50:03] joffbozoss: This is what you get for not banning bard f
[1:50:19] auri_sariel: Santorini just got bambied
[1:51:40] Dezrunner: I tried jungling yesterday man, you baited me into that sh*t role by making it look so easy :P
[1:52:53] Iamaf33d3r: Jungle is easy you pve 90% of the game
[1:52:58] Iamaf33d3r: prove me wrong xD
[1:53:48] auri_sariel: yes, he for sure didnt misclick the portal KEKW
[1:53:49] nwa4lifeTV: neeko is sweaty
[1:55:41] auri_sariel: what u do with it is up to ur creativity
[1:56:21] DJ_Photik: Is Bel a bat
[1:56:27] Zopicx: why not herald use when jungle is down
[1:56:34] DJ_Photik: Vladimir cousin? Confirmed
[1:56:50] auri_sariel: @photikx a void creature, apparently the empress of it
[1:56:55] auri_sariel: self proclaimed one
[1:56:59] Iamaf33d3r: this Palworlds mod looks crazy @Santorin
[1:57:02] Zopicx: aah okey
[1:57:09] DJ_Photik: Ty @auri_sariel
[1:59:40] auri_sariel: something about the battle boss bel veth sound effects makes me unnerved
[2:00:48] Iamaf33d3r: i still  don't get what the point of the form is
[2:00:55] Iamaf33d3r: other than more grubbies
[2:01:06] auri_sariel: @Iamaf33d3r it increases ur stats by quite a bit
[2:01:27] auri_sariel: and makes u tankier
[2:01:31] MahshoLoL: also if u kill a jax now LMAO u get 3 min form
[2:02:00] darkkkona: on god
[2:02:21] Caendred: @mahsholol is this real?
[2:02:28] MahshoLoL: @Caendred yes
[2:02:34] MahshoLoL: new event thing
[2:02:48] MahshoLoL: its like the senna thresh event in game
[2:02:52] Caendred: That's pretty neat
[2:02:58] MahshoLoL: lore matchup
[2:03:15] Caendred: But Jax doesn't give u void babies right? Just 3min?
[2:03:27] Iamaf33d3r: this lilia is just getting CC'd every time she is alive
[2:03:37] MahshoLoL: he gives u the 3 min form aka true form which gives u ur void fish things
[2:03:55] Caendred: Not all true forms give babies tho
[2:03:58] MahshoLoL: the lore being jax the last icathia survivor vs the void
[2:04:20] opticdyno: the be belvussy
[2:04:21] Caendred: So maybe Jax is just extended 3min without babies or else it would be too strong
[2:04:24] MahshoLoL: @Caendred 3 min form gives little guys 60 second doesnt
[2:04:33] Caendred: Well that's op
[2:04:49] MahshoLoL: yeah its supposed to be even but like belveth gets the better end
[2:04:53] Caendred: It's like the shen vs zed event where shen gets 35% bonus shielding
[2:05:04] Caendred: And zed gets like 5% DMG increase
[2:05:58] MahshoLoL: yeah they made new ones but they arent even LMAO
[2:06:02] opticdyno: ghostblade should be removed
[2:06:06] omertaszsg: nice team you got there gameplay looks so nice :D
[2:06:13] Melquiiiway: winner's queue
[2:06:53] auri_sariel: sore neck muscles?
[2:07:54] opticdyno: wwhas your attack speed?
[2:07:58] festeringjester: gg
[2:07:58] darkkkona: what stats upgrades give
[2:08:04] Saturn_Seven: I see jungle is super weak this patch LUL
[2:08:06] omertaszsg: put a pillow on lower back
[2:08:09] Caendred: Since the introduction of profane Hydra I don't see any point in ever building ravenous. Ravenous proc only rewards heavy life steal builds and the damage is nothing compared to profane @santorin
[2:10:15] darkkkona: kiting is op
[2:10:30] opticdyno: show attack speed
[2:11:11] omertaszsg: r you going for Rannk one
[2:11:21] omertaszsg: and how far is it
[2:12:13] Saturn_Seven: have we figured out what champions want to build terminus? for me it's like cryptobloom, cool effect, but no idea who builds it
[2:14:24] kamikaze_cabbage: so when does the butchering begin? LUL
[2:14:49] omertaszsg: LOL he got mad
[2:14:52] Saturn_Seven: LMAO
[2:14:52] auri_sariel: WOW XD
[2:15:01] Saturn_Seven: kogmaw passive?
[2:15:05] BurritoTX: got to throw that sphere when they are doing that im guessing?
[2:15:08] auri_sariel: you just got your cheeks spread wide Santorini XD
[2:19:47] Saturn_Seven: dang, no fan girls for you :/
[2:20:32] auri_sariel: teletubbies beats thanos though so u wanna say u winning?
[2:21:20] auri_sariel: BRUH nvm, rest in peace
[2:21:29] auri_sariel: i guess teletubbies lose
[2:22:16] Saturn_Seven: your team is all about cucking their engage, as long as your team has hands it's good no?
[2:22:42] Velraptured: More Lillia ResidentSleeper
[2:23:07] auri_sariel: its still crazy how lillias auto attack was classified as ranged for such a long time
[2:24:31] Caendred: @auri_sariel well it was keeping all of us safe from conqueror lillia
[2:25:02] auri_sariel: @Caendred i dont play lillia but im glad she became meta and a lot thanks to changing her auto to melee XD
[2:27:19] auri_sariel: ggwp, gl next
[2:29:32] Ianenglish27: why do you think Lucian struggles so much in pro play so often? hasn’t seemed great so far this year despite high prio
[2:30:13] auri_sariel: @Ianenglish27 Lucian is doing absolutely great in pro play, its just not doing good in the west and its because of not good mechanics
[2:30:25] auri_sariel: in LCK and LPL it dominates
[2:31:27] Saturn_Seven: honestly I don't think its a mechanics diff, its a macro diff. west just doesn't play well around lucian midgame
[2:31:37] auri_sariel: could be that too
[2:33:36] jzipfel20: you did call it!
[2:33:54] tiginron: Prophet
[2:34:29] Ianenglish27: did you guys feel like underdogs at all when you were on flyquest?
[2:35:46] Saturn_Seven: was it you that said before sometimes it's better to do the wrong thing together than try the right thing alone
[2:36:56] rinseandretreat: a big one eh?
[2:37:37] pandamixed: Best parrt is when you ping for them to follow, they don't come,  then they flame you for not having objectives :)
[2:38:01] Ianenglish27: do you think jungle is especially laner dependent this season?
[2:38:34] Pock3tsand: giga farmed
[2:38:44] TakingtheCake: No 5v5s, just get caught and die, got it.
[2:38:52] Saturn_Seven: can't even finish the sentence LUL
[2:39:59] Pock3tsand: wcgw>
[2:40:16] DJ_Photik: Goobers
[2:40:30] auri_sariel: @Santorin whatcha think about Upset going for his 3rd 10th place in LEC?
[2:41:09] Saturn_Seven: wait did that renata q someone over a wall or was that just ez e?
[2:41:41] TeapotGeneral: comical how the team saw kennen behind but still dies to his flank
[2:42:58] therealgenesis29: Gims pogg
[2:44:15] Pock3tsand: landing qs is overrated
[2:44:41] Sorenzin1: jaksho?
[2:45:08] Saturn_Seven: metas when ez is strong are terrible bc so many adcs pick it when they don't play it
[2:46:07] Pock3tsand: stylin on em with the flash
[2:47:04] auri_sariel: that ezreal just collected like 3 shutdowns
[2:47:28] Saturn_Seven: could have gone randuins maybe?
[2:48:30] auri_sariel: ezreal ult killed the renata dw
[2:48:35] Pock3tsand: literally 1v9ing
[2:49:26] Saturn_Seven: cursed book monkaW
[2:50:11] Saturn_Seven: wp
[2:50:17] auri_sariel: i dunno, the janna kept u alive for so long XD
[2:50:30] ucandoit69: Lillia go brrrr
[2:51:11] ucandoit69: challenjour soon
[2:51:27] RandomGraves: isn't trist that noway4usir person?
[2:51:31] VantageS4: Do you think having zhonyas active removed completely on seekers would be bad balancing?
[2:51:39] Saturn_Seven: surely it was from tanking tower
[2:51:43] Saturn_Seven: yeah
[2:52:48] bobbybobsen4201: Song name? *u* havint heard it in YEARS! LESGOO
[2:52:54] bobbybobsen4201: support in ALL my games LUL
[2:52:57] bobbybobsen4201: feelsbadman
[2:53:29] cycle_sisters: thats why i almost invade early game
[2:53:36] cycle_sisters: almost never*
[2:53:38] auri_sariel: but the Janna made up for it, in that last fight shes the only reason u survived c:
[2:54:18] DemionDemon: o7
[2:55:24] ucandoit69: I think it should have a longer cooldown
[2:55:31] ucandoit69: 2 minutes is not that long
[2:56:02] lubemila: seems games are good today santorinHype
[2:56:14] bobbybobsen4201: Amen Brother
[2:56:39] crecentbear: 3
[2:56:47] Lokrakil: I’m just happy there aren’t 10 stopwatches in every pro game anymore
[2:57:03] crecentbear: im top 200 lillia player na so i like watching you to play to try and refine my play
[2:57:56] bobbybobsen4201: had a lillia in my game yesterday.. her BASE ms was 700..
[2:57:58] auri_sariel: Can Santorin do a really good impression of Lillias EEP?
[2:58:01] VantageS4: I had a conversation with my brother where I said it's unfair you can use stopwatch, buy zhonyas, and then use the active again next team fight. Do you think it would be bad for the game if they removed the active from components completely?
[2:58:14] Rodacon: I remember returning to the game months after they added stopwatch and finding it so weird that it was being used so much
[2:59:40] auri_sariel: OOH this saturday we have the match of the weak in LEC!
[2:59:41] Rodacon: although that was probably before they added the minimum timer for the free one
[2:59:48] bobbybobsen4201: is it Really out play tho? Kappa
[2:59:51] TeapotGeneral: could it not just have a shared cooldown between hourglass and armguard?
[3:00:21] auri_sariel: Karmine Corp - Rogue, 9th and 10th teams XD
[3:00:25] bobbybobsen4201: Hue Hue Hue
[3:00:32] Lokrakil: it was too much of a get-out-of-jail-free card when it was a rune and way cheaper
[3:00:51] Lokrakil: would be like making ekko ult a rune or item
[3:00:53] Rodacon: If KC lose to Rogue then they'll have achieved something truly special
[3:01:02] Ancarage: i remember they used to let you have stop watch and hour glass in the inventory PepeLaugh
[3:01:29] Rodacon: @Ancarage Yeah, that was so BS LUL
[3:01:44] Ancarage: @Rodacon i did some stupid things with playing meme build on ww getting stopwatch, then hrglass then get 1 more stop watch for GA PepeLaugh
[3:01:52] bobbybobsen4201: typical league teammates LUL LESGOOO
[3:02:08] auri_sariel: @Rodacon i think they already have the worst debut split of a team in LEC history
[3:02:45] Rodacon: @auri_sariel Yeah but a 0/9 is right around the corner
[3:02:59] motorboater2: I got some wood for you AlienPls3 AlienPls3 AlienPls3
[3:03:11] auri_sariel: i mean if you look at it positively, Kcorp already got an LEC record, although it being a negative one KEKW
[3:03:33] bobbybobsen4201: PowerUpL CrreamAwk PowerUpR  Ez win! PogBones
[3:03:43] Rodacon: Even Astralis weren't this bad, and they clearly never cared
[3:04:15] bobbybobsen4201: unreal... that BRAND cleares faster than graves .. xd
[3:04:40] bobbybobsen4201: thats alot no??
[3:04:53] bobbybobsen4201: 20 sec in a diamond game or higher, thats ALOT ?
[3:04:54] auri_sariel: Santorin going for the smokescreen Graves bug?
[3:04:58] DemionDemon: -10 social credit
[3:05:05] khoajsp: is grave's clear speed slow or is it just me
[3:05:26] Metal_Gods: not the fastest but very healthy
[3:05:39] khoajsp: ah i thought i was doing something wrong since his autos aren't normal
[3:05:42] walmartimport: Hey chat and gl in future games Santorin!
[3:06:04] bobbybobsen4201: HeyGuys
[3:06:36] lubemila: hi @walmartimport santorinCheers

[3:08:20] auri_sariel: KEKW
[3:08:22] walmartimport: What do you chat think is Bard balanced atm? I talked with this EUW rank1 Bard player Lathyrus and he showed Clip in stream where he soloed Syndra with 2 Qs, 5 autos and 3 sheen procs. I don't understand this game that much but support doing that seems weird.
[3:08:29] DemionDemon: ardent censer *foaming at the mouth*
[3:09:13] Rodacon: LUL
[3:09:15] auri_sariel: cause u took the kill from him, Karma is sure if u gave him the kill he would survive KEKW
[3:09:19] Rodacon: Didn't take the cannon though
