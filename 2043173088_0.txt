[0:12:10] AllyCaatt: AllyCaatt gifted a Tier 1 sub to TehJow! 
[0:12:10] Fishur: Roughly anyway
[0:12:17] FiraaTurk: Bro, dont sub from phone if you can avoid it. it cost like 60 cents more or something stupid
[0:12:21] mcrincat: @cleankiwi yeah cause i will use this one for 1 year before i build something better,i need it for game dev stuff! jydnFine
[0:12:29] padampadamm: ill sub when im home from pc
[0:12:35] Femuline: yes never sub from the mobile app, it‚Äôs $1 extra
[0:12:40] allys_wrld15: yes it is
[0:12:41] Femuline: you can sub on mobile browser tho
[0:12:47] Femuline: as long as it‚Äôs directly on a browser
[0:12:50] Fishur: Subbing from phone is higher prices than any other way of subbing.
[0:12:52] padampadamm: damn thats trashy chatging extra just cause its app

[0:13:14] padampadamm: oh so its greedy Apple as usual

[0:13:18] boutch28: its apple fees
[0:13:27] Fishur: Its the app-stores that takes money from it, not the other.
[0:13:30] Oakley85: @KayPea Apple takes part of any sub revenue for any app. That's why you can't sub to spotify on the app. They said fuck you Apple and didn't allow it
[0:13:34] Femuline: i was subbing to like 6 ppl on the app store for a while not realizing i was paying extra
[0:13:41] Hattnissen: Twitch also separates your subscription in your account. You actually have a separate tab for mobile subscriptions
[0:13:49] goldielocks2000: @Oakley85 I like that about spotify

[0:34:31] FeedTheTank: @KayPea they changed mid to make it more safe for mages, but assassin's still press 1 button and kill thousands of people
[0:34:47] theLevya: i think you complain that champions like akali do magic damage
[0:34:49] J_to_the_jf: how bout this... STOP MAKING MORE CHAMPIONS LUL

[0:36:35] Azmod3ous: @KayPea honestly I prefer to play Diana bruiser. She can solo baron with 5 items XD.

[0:37:11] jimbob_ywert: it‚Äôs kind of funny how tank items ridiculously work on mages too like the tank build that demolished fizz yesterday üò≠
[0:38:17] Smoothcollie: So are they nerfing mage items? Any leaks or pbe news?
[0:38:25] coifmonkeey: all good here had an awesome day üòÅ closed some insane deals @kaypea
[0:38:43] S17Master: @jimbob_ywert tbf that wouldn't have worked so well if the Fizz player looked at KP's build and stopping trying to one shot
[0:38:48] goldielocks2000: @coifmonkeey nice, im happy for you :D
[0:39:09] PulsefireLux13: Oooooo we up early! morning kaypea!!
[0:39:15] J_to_the_jf: it's easier for them to nerf an item than it is a champion rework. Riot is taking the easy way out cause they don't care anymore
[0:39:23] coifmonkeey: thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è @kaypea @goldielocks2000
[0:39:31] goldielocks2000: FLIGHT OF THE SILVERBIRD <3

[0:39:35] mandarina3lol: what do u think ab anivia this season? Is she any good?
[0:39:39] h3fmay: @KayPea banshee is now pretty good for mages with the new build path
[0:39:55] Leaskk: this music sounds like i should be having seconf breakfast and be living in the shire
[0:40:02] coifmonkeey: gonna hit the magical number this year it seems üòÅüòÅ
[0:40:44] Smoothcollie: Ye it's actually an easy fix, just add that the item wont work so good when u don't have 500 minimum range or some shit. Like literally, just adjust it, what's so hard
[0:40:49] sovitiaisavampire: ok we've heard of first mid, what about second mid?
[0:41:31] guiltyprawn: @sovitiaisavampire Sounds like  0/5 Draven-talk Susge
[0:41:35] PulsefireLux13: how do we think of lux this season?? I‚Äôve found her kinda weak against other mages now :/
[0:41:55] mrry2k: why is every mf in ur game a little bit goofy
[0:42:05] jimbob_ywert: Lux is flexible with builds which makes her good
[0:42:34] healerhouse: Ah yes, league. Another season, another batch of toxic people blaming you for not being psychic because you don't know what they're thinking.
[0:42:35] Necrothia: Hey Kay and Chat
[0:42:41] Necrothia: how have thje games been ?
[0:42:50] AllyCaatt: @pulsefirelux13 I feel like she‚Äôs in the middle right now I feel like she‚Äôs strong against some but weak against others

[0:43:47] Necrothia: velvet125AWave Sparkweee
[0:43:55] goldielocks2000: league is and never will be balanced
[0:44:18] sparkweee: @necrothia kaypHYPERS
[0:44:18] S17Master: Have there ever been items that have the nerfed effect for melee?
[0:44:42] AllyCaatt: @goldielocks2000 true lmao
[0:44:45] Yeyni14: !EU
[0:44:45] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[0:44:49] Necrothia: @sparkweee kaypHYPERS
[0:44:53] guiltyprawn: They can jump in, kill 2 and get out if even. Kill 5 and get out if ahead. And kill 1 and get out if behind
[0:44:53] Smoothcollie: The team didn't follow tho when u hit the Q
[0:45:13] Sunnytinker: hurriance
[0:45:19] Sunnytinker: i believe is one
[0:45:27] kevinsen1997: tiamat

[0:45:38] Darkcyter: @S17Master kaypHello

[0:45:39] olson869: Blade and tiamat
[0:45:41] CipherAdminShady: ?
[0:45:42] Lynx1108: stormsurge also right?
[0:45:47] Darkcyter: @PulsefireLux13 kaypHello
[0:45:48] GunzaPrime: BOTRK used to have different effectiveness for melee vs ranged
[0:46:02] GunzaPrime: @Darkcyter kaypPengu
[0:46:05] jimbob_ywert: AP items became so diverse that champs like IRELIA and twitch, Mundo, udyr, and riven üíÄ
[0:46:07] avorleen: avorleen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:46:08] goldielocks2000: too bad you lost
[0:46:17] salamanco1: rank?
[0:46:19] sparkweee: well that‚Äôs what they need to do for melee because if we think about it melee mage assassins are the only busted ap people right now
[0:46:28] FieryKeeper: rn first strike is nerfed more for range i think too
[0:46:28] backstreetalright: the team chemistry was off
[0:46:28] pixeldematter: Hello how is everyone :3
[0:46:37] alexx_meridaa: How do you like Morgana mid Max W?
[0:46:43] 1meatsqueezer: stormsurge is stronger for melee
[0:46:48] Smoothcollie: Well we already have this in runes. If one runs would be broken on range champs, they adjust the stats. It's not like this technique would be new to league
[0:46:59] 1meatsqueezer: look at the item next time
[0:47:03] 1meatsqueezer: its stronger for melee
[0:47:20] guiltyprawn: I dont think it's the effects on items that are the problem. It's the stats. Melee champs by design have bigger rations and are beefier. The new items give more ap ergo they get more dmg. And with one tanky item, good luck killing 'em
[0:47:24] 1meatsqueezer: base damage is 100-200 melle vs 75-150 magic
[0:47:26] jimbob_ywert: stormsurge is good for lux too she can burst from far and kill
[0:47:27] 1meatsqueezer: range*
[0:47:39] Nicolajbruhn: HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:48:13] guiltyprawn: ratios* not rations pepeLaugh
[0:48:13] jimbob_ywert: Good news is, I heard riot is putting all their focus on league now (after sadly firing lots of ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù employees‚Äù so now they‚Äôre focusing more on the balance team
[0:48:24] 1meatsqueezer: melee also get 20% ap ratio
[0:48:28] 1meatsqueezer: range get 15%
[0:48:36] guiltyprawn: I hope they fired the old balancing team. BabyYodaSip
[0:49:14] PulsefireLux13: I do enjoy the idea of mythics being gone, because it like makes people actually think about what items they need, rather than being forced into a certain item. but these new items are busted in combination with our older items
[0:49:44] Leaskk: whats that tank lux build with heartsteel?
[0:50:32] steviepewie: Theres a new kinda Lux tank build from Yozu which looks really good, u should check it out
[0:50:48] Leaskk: sweet thanks
[0:50:56] jimbob_ywert: tanks are super OP in this game, idk why ppl aren‚Äôt abusing them top more

[3:06:11] goldielocks2000: hahah I didnt even know what tft was. I had never played it
[3:06:20] alexdefoeahri: actually the new split kinda fed up the matchmaking.. i was master last season and got into emerald IV first game of promos in new split xD
[3:06:23] littlejellyfishy: @SickeningTouchLoL Isn't out yet
[3:07:01] quark978: i've been taking my time with palworld. I haven't really even explored the map
[3:07:06] darth_quake: isnt the music a bit too loud?
[3:07:10] xLippyy: i mean, the tutorial is pretty good, butyeah they definitely need to add some story line to it
[3:07:12] FeedTheTank: @alexdefoeahri feelsbadman, i got plat 4 after wasting 4 months grinding to diamond 2
[3:07:20] xBoomShotBaby: they are not having the best time atm
[3:07:22] hydroh0mie07: @goldielocks2000 It's really fun, but also challenging :D also the only way I'll play ranked in a Riot game haha
[3:07:39] alexdefoeahri: @FeedTheTank yeah its crazy, everyone started so low for no reason, so no wonder jhin got into such game
[3:07:58] FeedTheTank: @alexdefoeahri might just be his promo games
[3:08:09] xBoomShotBaby: jhin and yuumi together is so broken tho, especially late game
[3:08:20] watson1235: I like the volume rn tbh
[3:08:22] anarkhali: no?
[3:08:24] ericaborgest: music is ok
[3:08:25] alexdefoeahri: surely it is, i got out of emerald after promos, but the fact that i started there is a bit off
[3:08:35] CrazySzopen: @daniel_12 how you learn speak english ?
[3:08:39] guiltyprawn: :o I found more intel kaypSpy He went from low plat to Masters in 2 months. The intel i have does show that it was either the absolutely worst possible matchmaking getting him to climb or it was a boost. Based on what i'm seeing it was all a boost tho kaypSpy
[3:08:42] goldielocks2000: @hydroh0mie07 I played it once, my boyfriend explained it and i won the first time LOL
[3:09:27] xBoomShotBaby: @guiltyprawn i was about to say he was probably boosted kaypPog
[3:09:29] guiltyprawn: He peaked in masters and then ended the split in Em3. It was a heavy dive into Em3. It was a boost
[3:09:35] daniel_12: @CrazySzopen ohh, nice I was in Poland once for a week in Kracow, Warsaw and a small town school related Lodz I believe
[3:09:38] alexdefoeahri: i was  genuely surprised i started so low xD my bf who was diamond IV last season was the same starting rank as me
[3:09:54] FeedTheTank: @guiltyprawn holy shit
[3:10:06] daniel_12: @CrazySzopen basically from when I was a kid and I liked it so much I became an English teacher :P
[3:10:09] jayjay_pechuga: wasn‚Äôt here when I got the sun but thank you!!! ü´° kaypLUL
[3:10:13] alexdefoeahri: @guiltyprawn LUL  wait wait did the system think im boosted? kekwait
[3:10:44] FeedTheTank: @alexdefoeahri i know the feeling and it is enough to make someone give up
[3:10:45] guiltyprawn: @alexdefoeahri I'm not spying you, i'm spying on the jhin
[3:10:53] just_jordannn: Hi kp and chat, how is everyone?
[3:10:55] daniel_12: There I learned the tongue twisteer Kril Karol... @CrazySzopen have you been to Romania?

[3:11:16] syntaaax: Ayo how much Mastery points U got on Lux?
[3:11:18] alexdefoeahri: @guiltyprawn nono its just i started as the same rank as jhin, thats why ,i know you didnt mean that towards me
[3:11:55] Bael_Af: Is horizon focus still good?
[3:12:01] just_jordannn: I started playing Senna yesterday and I'm in love
[3:12:12] guiltyprawn: Yup. My conclusion ends here. Jhin got boosted kaypSpy 98% sure. If it is the 2%, then Rito has some explaining to do on their rotten and raw spaghetti code
[3:12:29] CrazySzopen: @daniel_12 not yet, when i will learn more vocabulary and speak i should visit
[3:12:50] crimson_hyacinth: @just_jordannn senna is so much fun i love playing her
[3:12:59] alexdefoeahri: @FeedTheTank tbh fr tho, you climb and grind only to get backwards so much every split
[3:12:59] CrazySzopen: @daniel_12 first find better job next visit other country
[3:13:30] FeedTheTank: @alexdefoeahri i mean they did say they would reset your rank, but not like this shiit

[3:15:38] daniel_12: cool. I might help you witth an idea or to for what to do in Romania depending on how long you are willing to stay @CrazySzopen
[3:15:52] guiltyprawn: Pushing into baron was 100% the right call there. After baron, you couldn't have pushed b4 they spawn. Push into baron would work bc of respawn timers and walking from their base
[3:16:05] xBoomShotBaby: is Stormsurge not good on Lux?
[3:16:18] alexdefoeahri: @FeedTheTank yeah it is, dont rly like this 3 split system, 2 was fine, but 3 is a bit too much

[3:17:17] YamiCF: noctourn has a lot of health for a squishy assassin
[3:17:29] FeedTheTank: @FeedTheTank definetly might take a break from ranked during 1 of them
[3:17:36] YamiCF: just realized he built frozen heart
[3:17:38] guiltyprawn: Noc is building bruiser @YamiCF
[3:18:09] tinyyy912: Tanktourn
[3:18:15] alexdefoeahri: @FeedTheTank dw they will release a victorious skin on the champ you like in that exact split you want to take break at Kapp

[3:25:08] BalimongCZ: im doing great even tho I got fired from my job after one month when I helped them during the Christmas and New Year and after that they said bye to me
[3:25:32] saturosss: i am afraid of planes and flights in general. i have organized a trip in barcelona this year and i am trembling of fear. how i get over this? or i take the car and waste 2 days? hahah
[3:25:46] quark978: welp gg
[3:25:48] xBoomShotBaby: sadge

[3:25:57] xBoomShotBaby: Nocturne inted that tho
[3:25:59] Galetea: that noc ult was an int tbh
[3:25:59] jkbratcher: why Noc ult in that?
[3:26:00] hydroh0mie07: How'd you feel about the new AP items so far? For me some feel slightly overpowered *cough* stormsurge *cough* @KayPea
[3:26:06] Inghak: F
[3:26:07] Rholihlahla: so positive
[3:26:12] ericaborgest: noc inted
[3:26:19] jkbratcher: Noc Inted
[3:26:23] DenYukinari: Ggs ;-; unlucky
[3:26:23] littlejellyfishy: NOOOO NOOOO NOOOO
[3:26:33] lkechu: @saturosss why dont u take an ansiolitic before the flight
[3:26:42] watson1235: @luciano_sm if they are in the us there are no job protections like that really.
[3:26:49] xninina: @saturosss take things to occupy yourself with, books, music, podcasts, videos, movies, chewing gums, things to play with your hands, things to chew on in general
[3:27:11] saturosss: yes but a small one
[3:27:26] kristykat_: how many stackage did you end with?
[3:27:29] littlejellyfishy: @xninina Things to chew on.... Does chewing on my friend's arm count?
[3:27:40] littlejellyfishy: @kristykat_ over 20
[3:27:49] xninina: @littlejellyfishy hahaha hey anything goes!
[3:27:55] Terhadalas: oh no! we lost that game?!?
[3:27:59] Niomah: @saturosss You can request your doc prescribe you an anti-anxiety medication for the flight there and back.
[3:28:01] jkbratcher: How was the prediction?
[3:28:03] TMFPhoenix: I've always been told you're safer in a plane rather a car
[3:28:04] kristykat_: niceee
[3:28:13] Oakley85: As a 6'5" person my fear is always leg room and having to use the bathroom on a plane
[3:28:20] mathshare: could you play ezreal for me ???
[3:28:26] jzipfel20: As long as the plane doesn‚Äôt fall apart
[3:28:28] ericaborgest: usually anxiety and fear come from not knowing all the facts, so maybe try looking it up stats like KP said @saturosss  :) that's what my therapist says too
[3:28:29] HunterrPlayyz: hellooo
[3:28:31] HunterrPlayyz: this song is fire
[3:28:33] xBoomShotBaby: kaypVibe kaypVibe
[3:28:34] lewhitehd69: yeah as a 6'5 i relate
[3:28:37] watson1235: yea you need a lot more qualifications to fly a plane than a car lol
[3:28:40] aty212121: Goodbye
[3:28:40] hydroh0mie07: For me it's just the fact that we're not grounded. I get so much anxiety that the plane will freeze and just fall xD
[3:28:47] crimson_hyacinth: @saturosss what exactly are you afraid of if you dont mind me asking? also maybe look up the jelly theorie(idk if thats an actaual theorie) you can look it up on tiktok
[3:28:53] aduecia: CIAO KAYPEAAAA
[3:28:58] littlejellyfishy: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[3:28:59] saturosss: yes it will be a bigger one. my fear is that i feel exposed that i cant control any situation happens
[3:29:07] xxpoodlepounderxx: but in a car you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like you gave more control. a plane is also full of strangers. bingShy
[3:29:20] Niomah: I have the opposite problem. I'm 5'3". Airplane seats hit my legs at the perfect place to cut off my circulation on a long flight, the headrest forces my head forward. I feel like a pretzel by the time I get off.
[3:29:20] lewhitehd69: if you do half baron twice you get one baron 5Head
[3:29:21] xBoomShotBaby: @lewhitehd69 kaypPog damn
[3:29:23] kristykat_: Do gamba
[3:29:29] jkbratcher: the prediction results for the dark Harvest?
[3:29:42] lewhitehd69: @lewhitehd69 i lied im 5'7 Sadge
[3:29:43] BalimongCZ: @luciano_sm you‚Äôre right at least u get one month before they can fire you in my country. But they just did it without asking, just kinda sad I left my family during the holidays for a new job where I got fired. But hey life goes on;)
[3:29:47] crimson_hyacinth: @Niomah omg same xD
[3:29:54] watson1235: 16+ won @jkbratcher
[3:30:05] aty212121: VOLDEMOR
[3:30:06] xninina: @saturosss i have the same fear, funny enough what made me ''get over it'' is flying with someone more afraid LUL  i tend to take the opposite role, when ppl are brave i allow myself being the scaredy cat, when ppl are scared im becoming the protector/warrior
[3:30:18] xBoomShotBaby: @lewhitehd69 close enough kaypLOL
[3:30:33] lewhitehd69: @lewhitehd69 kaypTroll exactly
[3:30:47] xxpoodlepounderxx: unfortunately control is an illusion. you can‚Äôt control most things. BUT as a person with an anxiety disorder I get it. luxxLaugh
[3:30:51] Oakley85: Also traveling with the right people helps a lot too
[3:31:12] watson1235: don‚Äôt do what I did last time I was anxious on a plane and get drunk and take anxiety meds lmao
[3:31:19] watson1235: I was messed up
[3:31:23] SoulOVibes: @xninina super cool way to think about it tbh might have to try that myself
[3:31:36] lewhitehd69: Madge dont mix alcohol and medication
[3:31:41] kristykat_: always :D
[3:31:55] keegs420: DO NOT take an edible on a plane, not a good time
[3:32:00] xBoomShotBaby: are we getting one more game?
[3:32:06] Valoputki: drink enough to sleep through the flight like a baby and just spawn on the other side of the world
[3:32:12] littlejellyfishy: Won every prediction today EZ
[3:32:16] Niomah: Doc can prescribe a mild anti anxiety medication for you. I suggest def going to your doc though, NOT self medicating
[3:32:18] HunterrPlayyz: HunterrPlayyz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! thanks for the great content and kindness! keep doing what you're doing <3
[3:32:19] Galetea: i wear leg compression socks during plane flights bc my legs hurt sitting for so long on planes. Also noise cancelling headphones are your best friend
[3:32:21] HAYB3AR: 1 more 1 more
[3:32:21] lewhitehd69: lucas is doing one more so PauseChamp
[3:32:25] jimbob_ywert: ending the day with 1 more win!
[3:32:26] crimson_hyacinth: tbh i love flying it kinda feels like a bus ride if you forget the fact that youre in the sky
[3:32:29] Darkcyter: @HunterrPlayyz WB
[3:32:29] watson1235: we need another chopea game 100% winrste
[3:32:45] Darkcyter: kaypFreya though
[3:32:46] xxpoodlepounderxx: lol I am scared of scared. I‚Äôm scared of getting panic attacks while driving or out in public. it‚Äôs a tough road to overcome. I‚Äôm doing it slowly.
[3:32:53] saturosss: yes i got it. thanks kelsie and all the people for the help. my mindset now is i cant miss the world for my fear and reach at fifties looking back and regreting. so i will try it this year
[3:32:56] jzipfel20: Cause 7-1 sounds better!
[3:32:56] xBoomShotBaby: so he can be 7-1 kaypAyyy
[3:33:00] PandaxLeopard: cuz he wanna go 6-2 xD jk
