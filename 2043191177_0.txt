[1:18:29] pureiinsanity: kinda stunned yourself for 2 seconds
[1:18:57] AtomCat1: @5up quick question about Renata passive. Do both parts proc when you have Nami E on you?
[1:19:10] pureiinsanity: it still took that long
[1:19:24] maya0978: Do you ever play irelia by chance?

[1:22:07] pureiinsanity: yes
[1:22:52] pureiinsanity: some of the utility is also greater
[1:23:03] pureiinsanity: the AP ratio's of W and E are deceiving
[1:23:13] NydusHerMain: braum renata let's go
[1:23:20] pureiinsanity: cuz u were giving 1k shields too
[1:23:46] pureiinsanity: braum is too low range
[1:23:56] pureiinsanity: braum has very hard time proccing renata
[1:24:00] iauja: nydus

[1:25:40] NydusHerMain: teemo support + renata
[1:25:41] NydusHerMain: ugu
[1:26:11] pureiinsanity: theres a chance you greif eachother tho
[1:26:12] NydusHerMain: until you end up with the teemo that blinds during ult
[1:26:18] pureiinsanity: you can build an enemy you want to hit their allu
[1:26:24] pureiinsanity: ally

[2:25:54] ChimeZee: you can double q the casters then e but thats a lot of mana :/

[2:27:22] Superphreakk: it definitely looks like it bullies, renata ult is very good
[2:27:35] pureiinsanity: it does
[2:28:01] coolwaveofcalm: Now you do damage
[2:28:42] coolwaveofcalm: NICE!!!
[2:28:42] pureiinsanity: hahhaha

[2:28:49] Gragnoth: aahaha that was hilarious!
[2:28:52] vDaishar: You know they're pissed about that
[2:28:55] GiantPacific0ctopus: this jhin is crying rn
[2:29:09] pureiinsanity: lulu has staff?
[2:29:27] pureiinsanity: not yet
[2:30:02] vDaishar: Sick flash
[2:30:04] pureiinsanity: that shield
[2:30:21] pureiinsanity: ardent?
[2:30:24] pureiinsanity: staff is better first
[2:30:48] Superphreakk: got viktor and darius on the team too
[2:30:49] iauja: stop backseating my friend
[2:30:52] iauja: ill fucking delete u
[2:30:54] Superphreakk: hi daniel
[2:31:05] iauja: hi frak
[2:31:31] pureiinsanity: or if W didnt run out
[2:32:48] Superphreakk: i think the mian problem is gonna range
[2:33:38] maverickx29: well played
[2:33:39] pureiinsanity: he had rookern
[2:33:43] Superphreakk: it seems like it will hard win lane, but can it actually safely fight without gettin slapped
[2:33:58] THE_Bacon90: lmfao this is just disgusting XD
[2:34:31] BurnedAether: Baron just watching the drag die. savage
[2:35:06] pureiinsanity: u mean bansie?
[2:35:23] TheFlayMaster: how a bout lich
[2:35:32] pureiinsanity: not lich
[2:35:37] pureiinsanity: its not
[2:35:43] BurnedAether: I don't think you cast enough for lich
[2:35:54] BurnedAether: Just too long of cooldowns
[2:35:56] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[2:36:03] pureiinsanity: its not that u dont cast enough it just isint the playstyle
[2:36:12] Superphreakk: lich on someone who (theoretically) wants to be autoing non stop, is usually not what you want
[2:36:25] pureiinsanity: ^
[2:36:26] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[2:36:41] BurnedAether: I was mainly thinking money value. Other items will give more even if you were trying to proc it
[2:36:48] RowBeanie: Did you know that there is a passive on lick in grey that says it gives you (i think) 40% attack speed?
[2:36:58] pureiinsanity: let lulu get staff?
[2:37:06] RowBeanie: I'm not sure why that is there in grey though
[2:37:50] jeskieKAT: Phreak :3
[2:38:15] Superphreakk: he didnt die
[2:38:16] Superphreakk: thats so sad
[2:38:17] pureiinsanity: the dmg
[2:38:33] pureiinsanity: ur a monster rn
[2:39:04] pureiinsanity: more than kog too
[2:40:08] Kexander: ?? man LMFAO
[2:40:27] schlake: I love watching this stream for the iron content
[2:40:34] Superphreakk: i think banshee's is almost required
[2:40:35] pureiinsanity: void staff is also good maybe 5th
[2:40:35] TheFlayMaster: did you just leave the drake to die of natural causes
[2:40:41] edestims: yesterday i thought i was almost done with this cosplay, today i know better
[2:40:48] Superphreakk: vi R ahri charm and you are kinda just dead
[2:40:54] pureiinsanity: @TheFlayMaster jhin 4th shot
[2:41:14] TheFlayMaster: ik ik its just they all left it xD
[2:41:33] pureiinsanity: its like he doesnt have rookern
[2:41:39] RowBeanie: I think banshees sounds solid, especially since the AP is so high now, it helps with passive dmg
[2:41:43] edestims: i’m listening to the stream in the background while i work 5upSigh
[2:42:12] pureiinsanity: buy amp tome
[2:42:35] pureiinsanity: yeah void last item
[2:42:42] Superphreakk: just one by one getting rooted lol
[2:43:10] pureiinsanity: you melt blue and red buff @5up
[2:43:33] greaxxyy: do you think it’s viable going renata ap mid ?
[2:44:22] Superphreakk: when they dont have cd's to actually lock you down they, fighting into you seems realllly bad for them
[2:44:27] pureiinsanity: yep it is
[2:45:46] AwesomeTree: gosh darn
[2:45:51] TheFlayMaster: limit testing gone wrong
[2:45:58] ChimeZee: he didnt deal 4444 what a scam
[2:45:58] lynn_lavender: when your team procs the second part of passive its kinda wild
[2:46:03] pureiinsanity: void staff time
[2:46:18] coolwaveofcalm: Why did your team start the fight without you?
[2:46:33] pureiinsanity: 75% attackspeed XD
[2:46:45] Superphreakk: trying to catch people at drag, and got caught out
[2:46:55] Superphreakk: cuz vi/bard can escape and they can't
[2:48:09] AwesomeTree: imagine someone having a bunch of heartsteel stacks and also getting boosted in size by lulu
[2:48:20] AwesomeTree: i wonder whats the max size that someone could get
[2:48:27] pureiinsanity: they focus u
[2:49:11] pureiinsanity: u need to ult early but its hard
[2:50:18] pureiinsanity: frozen heart is bad for u too
[2:52:50] iauja: ur passive
[2:52:53] iauja: counts as their dmg
[2:52:56] iauja: not yours
[2:53:02] pureiinsanity: got void
[2:53:18] pureiinsanity: gonna pack them soon
[2:54:02] TheFlayMaster: lets see the dmg bby
[2:54:04] Beemittens: 40% is crazy
[2:54:24] pureiinsanity: 44
[2:55:10] pureiinsanity: hgost W time
[2:55:36] maverickx29: lgwClap
[2:55:37] Beemittens: disgusting
[2:55:48] Beemittens: gg Clap
[2:55:52] pureiinsanity: im so happy i recommended you this
[2:55:58] coolwaveofcalm: double nexus explosion!!
[2:55:58] Antfrost: is this the tech you dmed me about
[2:56:00] z_palindrome: wp wp
[2:56:02] SyntheeR: Carried by Lulu 100%
[2:56:10] bulwak1992: Was that 40% max hp magic dmg
[2:56:11] SyntheeR: It was nice game to watch
[2:56:13] NydusHerMain: okay cool, time to start my day LOL
[2:56:16] NydusHerMain: that was fun
[2:56:18] Antfrost: that's chill
[2:56:22] JustaStoopidDog: thats like not okay lmao
[2:56:23] NydusHerMain: that was incredibly dumb
[2:56:33] iauja: open chat
[2:56:37] iauja: i wana see if they say anything about it
[2:56:39] Paper_Man: that is not right
[2:56:46] pureiinsanity: unmute
[2:56:53] iauja: unforch
[2:56:53] pureiinsanity: lul
[2:56:56] Antfrost: sure
[2:56:59] NydusHerMain: play it @Antfrost
[2:57:01] NydusHerMain: it's fun and brain dead easy
[2:57:02] Hayase64: Supp are broken
[2:57:15] NydusHerMain: the only scuffed part is accidentally keeping renata up for too long
[2:57:20] NydusHerMain: to outlast W
[2:57:29] pureiinsanity: 5upGun AP renata late game
[2:57:38] NydusHerMain: I rarely needed to polymorph it was chill
[2:57:44] bulwak1992: Is that per auto not every three?
[2:58:09] RowBeanie: @5up Similarly to Varus' radiant virtue build last season, do you think building core AP items and then a tankier build would be viable since she does % max health dmg?
[2:58:13] bulwak1992: Holy ap/as renata top
[2:58:14] pureiinsanity: LT might be better who knows
[2:58:27] PoteetLee: !editcom !team 5up and Antfrost.
[2:58:27] Fossabot: @PoteetLee Successfully updated command "!team"
[2:58:37] coolwaveofcalm: giant icons lol
[2:58:49] briweb11: the icons are very very big
[2:58:56] SyntheeR: Half screen icons for the win
[2:59:20] pureiinsanity: it will get nerfed when ppl figure out
[2:59:28] bulwak1992: Oh so it needs to be with lulu to pop off
[2:59:47] pureiinsanity: @bulwak1992 no other picks also work with it
[2:59:49] pureiinsanity: like amumu
[2:59:56] NydusHerMain: @bulwak1992 nono there are others
[3:00:02] NydusHerMain: but lulu was particularly gross
[3:00:12] bulwak1992: Does it proc off curse?
[3:00:20] NydusHerMain: the beauty of lulu is that "I" get to shut my brain off
[3:00:21] pureiinsanity: yeah lulu is disgusting
[3:00:29] Gragnoth: would ashe support work with it?
[3:00:43] NydusHerMain: @Gragnoth no joke I was thinking of picking ashe
[3:00:45] pureiinsanity: draven
[3:00:49] NydusHerMain: but I decided fuck it, let's trust him
[3:00:53] NydusHerMain: and played full enchanter
[3:00:58] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[3:01:02] Gragnoth: @NydusHerMain that's funny!
[3:01:09] NydusHerMain: it felt unfair
[3:01:14] pureiinsanity: @5up Staff rush for the extra MS it gives is proper
[3:01:20] NydusHerMain: but keep in mind you're not always going to have a rank 1 lulu
[3:01:29] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[3:01:29] Gragnoth: oh! or support MF with her e? would that work?
[3:01:32] NydusHerMain: @pureiinsanity I should've looked in chat
[3:01:38] NydusHerMain: I wasn't sure if I wanted to go ardent or staff first
[3:01:51] bulwak1992: I think the biggest ad counter to this would be Tristana with the bomb and jump screwing your W
[3:01:52] pureiinsanity: yeah i think staff is better
[3:01:55] pureiinsanity: helps running them down
[3:02:04] NydusHerMain: I kinda though so too
[3:02:10] NydusHerMain: *thought
[3:02:10] Gragnoth: @5up would ashe or MF support work with Renata?
[3:02:21] pureiinsanity: omg
[3:02:25] pureiinsanity: you melt ali in ult
[3:02:27] pureiinsanity: btw
[3:02:32] Gragnoth: the mf e to me feels like it'd be broken
[3:02:33] NydusHerMain: MF cds are too long
[3:02:52] Gragnoth: ah, that's fair
[3:03:01] bulwak1992: Would malzahar e do well into it
[3:03:02] pureiinsanity: that counters you
[3:03:05] pureiinsanity: but you dumpster ali
[3:03:09] NydusHerMain: zyra is pretty good vs this probably
[3:03:12] bulwak1992: Plus the ult
[3:03:27] NydusHerMain: I think lulu does but
[3:03:32] pureiinsanity: any range would be good vs this
[3:03:36] NydusHerMain: push pressure too strong
[3:03:38] Gragnoth: yeah, you guys crap on zyra
[3:03:46] Gragnoth: lol, should be an easy lane
[3:04:01] NydusHerMain: riot tried to remove double support items
[3:04:07] NydusHerMain: so instead we play double support
[3:04:18] pureiinsanity: ^
[3:04:33] pureiinsanity: i like how i played double support item renata APC day 1
[3:04:49] NydusHerMain: you were a pioneer
[3:04:55] blazin_barbie: fast lulu is so funny and so cute
[3:04:56] Superphreakk: haha
[3:04:58] NydusHerMain: I'm talking to insanity
[3:05:02] pureiinsanity: yeah it came from me
[3:05:06] NydusHerMain: big ego
[3:05:14] Gragnoth: lol
[3:05:22] Superphreakk: streamer just assumes he is the center of attention
[3:05:23] Superphreakk: again
[3:05:27] bulwak1992: I think people just missed the ap scaling since you need a friend
[3:06:00] pureiinsanity: "V12.9 Leverage Initial base damage reduced to 1% − 2% (based on level) of target's maximum health from 1% − 3.5% (based on level). Initial AP ratio increased to 2% per 100 AP from 1% per 100 AP. Ally base damage reduced to 1% − 2% (based on level) of target's maximum health from 1% − 3.5% (based on level). Ally AP ratio increased to 2% per 100 AP from 1% per 100 AP."
[3:06:04] Gragnoth: they regret everything! XD
[3:06:10] pureiinsanity: so 12.9
[3:06:32] pureiinsanity: meanwhile lulu since V13.21
[3:06:36] cameron416: boy what the fuck are these bot lanes
[3:06:46] NydusHerMain: I'm going to watch the vod and enjoy my day :)
[3:06:47] NydusHerMain: good luck
[3:06:57] pureiinsanity: bai
[3:07:08] Paper_Man: @cameron416 yep, adcs are that useless, 4 sups every game now
[3:07:17] pureiinsanity: yeah they have massive range
[3:07:26] pureiinsanity: they have more range than ur auto attack i think
[3:07:39] pureiinsanity: oh nvm
[3:07:51] bulwak1992: Does the passive auto count as a full auto?
[3:08:10] pureiinsanity: @bulwak1992 wt u mean
[3:08:59] bulwak1992: When renata autos it has a zap after does it count as a auto attack?
[3:09:31] pureiinsanity: @bulwak1992 no
[3:09:32] cameron416: i think ant needs to kill the plants with q and autos
[3:09:44] pureiinsanity: its a "proc" effect so it isint a spell either
[3:10:18] lil__soupy: hello 5up and chat 5upWave
[3:10:30] lil__soupy: how have games been?
[3:10:53] pureiinsanity: max rank kog W does 6%
[3:10:53] bulwak1992: @pureiinsanity I was thinking about terminus on her for increased pen and attack speed
[3:10:56] pureiinsanity: yes
[3:11:11] pureiinsanity: @bulwak1992 you want raw AP the more the better
[3:11:18] pureiinsanity: thats why we have max AP in runes too
[3:11:22] BluerBlack: Can you ulti her ult?
[3:11:30] pureiinsanity: its the highest AP scaling champ in the game
[3:11:44] blazin_barbie: as much as I love watching league and while I get the main objective the analytics to everything I will never get :(
[3:12:31] bulwak1992: So why void staff instead of a higher ap output
[3:12:35] pureiinsanity: @5up i think this is highest scaling AP champ in game
[3:12:52] pureiinsanity: its not Varus
[3:13:09] Gragnoth: panth r? or is that old panth?
[3:13:12] pureiinsanity: no this is better for sure
[3:13:24] Gragnoth: fair
[3:13:33] pureiinsanity: in raw ratio for 1 ability sure
[3:13:35] Gragnoth: I was just thinking scaling in general
[3:13:43] pureiinsanity: but in general
[3:13:51] pureiinsanity: yes in general its the most
[3:15:58] cameron416: on lulu? dreammaker
[3:16:16] pureiinsanity: true dreammaker is good too
[3:16:36] pureiinsanity: 4 ppl
[3:17:12] bulwak1992: @pureiinsanity briar E has 340% ap ratio just looked it up
[3:18:06] pureiinsanity: @bulwak1992 thats only for 1 ability, not exactly what i ment, AP brair isint even viable
[3:18:58] bulwak1992: Yeah I know I have no idea why they added it honestly
[3:19:56] FrozenLavaReflector: that ap ratio is for when you get baron buff
[3:20:50] FrozenLavaReflector: some people in this game make me want to rip my hair off
[3:21:26] pureiinsanity: it dont matter carrying this from this angle is not possible
[3:21:28] bulwak1992: But it makes no sense @frozenlavareflector  or is zed/talon missing a trick with baron buff
[3:21:36] FrozenLavaReflector: jungler telling he wants more towers secured before taking baron... as all enemy tier 2's were down... tilter
[3:21:56] ChimeZee: that drag was cruel
[3:23:12] pureiinsanity: true u can Q mid air
[3:23:16] bulwak1992: Would it be better to get

[3:26:50] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[3:26:54] pureiinsanity: cuz pix has a max attackspeed cap
[3:27:21] pureiinsanity: thats lower than normal auto attacks
[3:27:32] pureiinsanity: i dont remember exactly
[3:27:34] bulwak1992: I feel like pta gets you to the late game a bit safer could also go Fleet
[3:27:40] pureiinsanity: i just know it was lower than normal champ cap
[3:28:38] bulwak1992: @5up you said you found it hard to catch people Fleet footwork solves that
[3:28:48] NydusHerMain: okay I just watched the vod :> endorphin rush successful
[3:28:59] Superphreakk: lol nerd
[3:29:40] pureiinsanity: some people on reddit say pix has 2.0 atspd cap

[3:56:54] pureiinsanity: item
[3:57:04] cameron416: the plant
[3:57:05] pureiinsanity: he has the trailblazer
[3:57:11] cameron416: he booped away
[3:57:12] pureiinsanity: which gives MS
[3:57:47] Halofan642: what the fuck
[3:57:53] Halofan642: this seems so much better adc btw
[3:57:57] Halofan642: just cuz u get gold income
[3:58:23] pureiinsanity: premade yes
[3:58:24] pureiinsanity: it is
[3:58:27] Halofan642: does lulus pixie thing proc ur passive?
[3:58:37] pureiinsanity: yes it does
[3:58:48] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 it do
[3:58:51] bulwak1992: does janna shield proc renata passive?
[3:58:53] Halofan642: yeah lulu is totally the play then
[3:59:00] pureiinsanity: no
[3:59:03] bulwak1992: i dont think it would
[3:59:12] cameron416: janna just gives u more stats
[3:59:25] Halofan642: would it be worth for void staff in some games?
[3:59:30] pureiinsanity: no she dont
[3:59:32] pureiinsanity: she gives you AD
[3:59:35] pureiinsanity: AD is useless
[3:59:40] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 yes
[3:59:47] Halofan642: cause 40% pen on a 25% max hp attack seems food
[3:59:49] Halofan642: good
[4:00:04] pureiinsanity: oh it goes beyond 25% halo
[4:00:14] cameron416: i said more stats i didnt say useful ones KEKW
[4:00:19] wetsfeeb: 4 autos.. lol
[4:00:24] pureiinsanity: renata passive
[4:00:24] Halofan642: yeah but i mean right now it’s like 30% right
[4:00:25] bulwak1992: @Halofan642 it gets to like 40^
[4:00:28] pureiinsanity: considres ally dmg
[4:00:46] pureiinsanity: @Antfrost its cuz renata passive gives u it
[4:00:54] Halofan642: yeah that’s so insane @bulwak1992
[4:01:02] lavfully: i love 5frost botlane shenanigans
[4:01:40] TheLightningThie: renata mid or what?
[4:01:41] briweb11: lol
[4:01:42] Halofan642: and lulu gets to go staff into ardent holy fuck
[4:01:53] bulwak1992: the real question is can we get it to work with yuumi
[4:01:55] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 yes
[4:01:55] cameron416: @TheLightningThie apc
[4:01:57] NydusHerMain: @Halofan642 yup
[4:02:04] Halofan642: im a believer bro this shit is dark tech @pureiinsanity
[4:02:22] Halofan642: playing it as the farmer seems so much better tho
[4:02:24] lavfully: secret tech
[4:02:45] pureiinsanity: i just randomly compared it to Varus W when looking at wiki
[4:02:46] pureiinsanity: and realised
[4:02:49] pureiinsanity: something not ok
[4:03:01] bulwak1992: wait does ardent proc her passive?
[4:03:01] pureiinsanity: cuz its WAY more than Varus W
[4:03:13] Halofan642: ya i saw this in arena a few times but it lost every time cause it was low elo arena
[4:03:15] pureiinsanity: @bulwak1992 no
[4:03:23] Halofan642: but it was funny to watch
[4:03:28] bulwak1992: awww nuts
[4:03:30] Halofan642: just didn’t think it was SR viable but i’m a believer
[4:03:34] pureiinsanity: its so fun to watch
[4:03:50] pureiinsanity: 5up didn't think it was SR viable too
[4:04:18] pureiinsanity: yeah it is
[4:04:22] pureiinsanity: 100%
[4:04:25] pureiinsanity: it is
[4:04:29] pureiinsanity: competitve games drag out
[4:04:30] pureiinsanity: for ever
[4:04:31] Halofan642: yeah the pixie thing proccing it is insane
[4:04:35] Halofan642: what’s renatas aa range
[4:04:59] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 550
[4:05:00] Halofan642: i could see renata losing hard to cait lux, varus/ez karma etc
[4:05:04] bulwak1992: is there any other champions that proc the passive like lulu does?
[4:05:08] pureiinsanity: more than kaisa
[4:05:08] Halofan642: oh 550 isn’t bad yeah
[4:05:22] pureiinsanity: amumu is really good with her too
[4:05:24] cameron416: milio
[4:05:26] Halofan642: does liandrys proc it ?
[4:05:38] ChimeZee: i really like that such build exists and it looks healthy enough, with counterplay
[4:05:38] pureiinsanity: unsure if it does
[4:05:46] pureiinsanity: i tried it a few months ago and liandry didnt proc it
[4:06:18] pureiinsanity: but i've seen in some video's of liandry proccing it from like a year ago
[4:06:19] Demonbroz1: I do think that millio is the best backup if Lulu is taken due to how the DOT is applied
[4:06:27] bulwak1992: by that logic fizz would big pretty good then?
[4:06:38] pureiinsanity: i think amumu is best backup
[4:07:20] Halofan642: what about zyra?
[4:07:28] pellepingo: What if you played double engage tank bot lane, or like double diver, then moved the ranged carry top to farm?
[4:07:41] pureiinsanity: pyke is so free
[4:07:43] pureiinsanity: you melt him
[4:07:50] pureiinsanity: omg
[4:07:56] pureiinsanity: he's gonna steal ur ult
[4:07:59] pureiinsanity: ur gonna kill your team
[4:08:16] Halofan642: @pellepingo this used to be a thing but what happens in higher elo is the double melee gets poked out and loses a lot of plates/first tower
[4:08:20] wetsfeeb: no renata skin WutFace
[4:08:36] saiter2000: you guys are doing the double supp item?
[4:08:42] 1likeicecreams: Imo they should make turf wars quicker and change it into a mini game
[4:08:53] pellepingo: @halofan642 even if they go steamroll aggro from minute one?
[4:08:58] pureiinsanity: @5up Sylas will make you kill your own team LUL
[4:09:00] cameron416: @saiter2000 no renata farming
[4:09:43] Halofan642: @pellepingo who? do you mean the double tanks going steamroll aggro? yeah in higher elos adc players will abuse the auto attack range difference between the adc and the melee very well
[4:10:17] coolwaveofcalm: The Primal Ambush Vi skin has cool splash art, but idk what it look like in game
[4:10:19] AidMich: is it every max w first or is the e that good
[4:10:40] Halofan642: nilah is the closest exception except she gets aa range on q, has an ability that blocks autos straight up, has her two dashes, has aoe wave clear, gets extra xp to make up the cs diff
[4:10:54] cameron416: @pellepingo they wont be able to farm then, or are easy to gank bc theyre low from constant skirmishing. if they cant secure the kill it's useless
[4:11:14] Halofan642: i’ve seen melees played both with some success in soloq, by irelia,kat, and wukong otps
[4:11:24] pellepingo: I guess that makes sense. I was thinking even with the range diff you could go aggro bot with double tank and just stat check. Based on the feeling that tanks are stronger early game than later
[4:11:54] Halofan642: the “best” stat in league is auto attack range
[4:11:54] pellepingo: But yeah I lowkey forgot about ganks and skirmishing 😂
[4:12:03] Halofan642: it’s easily the most impactful.
[4:12:06] blazin_barbie: is he playing with ant? or am i seeing things
[4:12:16] Halofan642: yeah it’s ant
[4:12:38] Halofan642: this man says cheese lanes
[4:12:42] Halofan642: as renata lulu
[4:12:57] coolwaveofcalm: Pyke Pantheon sounds like my actual nightmare for a lane
[4:12:57] blazin_barbie: oooo how is the renata lulu going ?
[4:13:06] NydusHerMain: the gay is right
[4:13:34] pellepingo: Wait I just realized the enemy team is going double engage melee bot
[4:13:56] pellepingo: Not really tanks tho
[4:14:01] THE_Bacon90: LuL
[4:14:01] ChimeZee: i cant
[4:14:03] cameron416: ant is so prophetic
[4:14:04] Halofan642: what the fuck
[4:14:05] niconico39: xdd
[4:14:09] vDaishar: LMAO
[4:14:10] briweb11: LOL
[4:14:11] coolwaveofcalm: LOL
[4:14:15] pellepingo: Huh?
[4:14:16] milkis9098: BETTER
[4:14:19] THE_Bacon90: 5frost!!!!
[4:14:21] z_palindrome: thats crazy
[4:14:24] NydusHerMain: my jaw is dropped
[4:14:30] milkis9098: disgusting plays
[4:14:43] vDaishar: Oh no don't dive me pls- lol jk thanks
[4:14:46] pellepingo: Game won I guess
[4:15:08] pureiinsanity: its insane u have 2 supports worth of utility
[4:15:14] pureiinsanity: while doing more dmg than carries
[4:15:43] vDaishar: I cant
[4:15:44] Halofan642: LOOOL
[4:15:46] z_palindrome: they simply do not learn
[4:15:52] THE_Bacon90: KEKW
[4:15:52] cameron416: ur such a roach LOL
[4:16:00] Halofan642: YOU STILL HAVENT CLEANSED EITHER RHAHA
[4:16:01] milkis9098: that’s insane
[4:16:01] coolwaveofcalm: Ant is psychic
[4:16:06] vDaishar: Ant is literally reading them like a book
[4:16:16] Halofan642: @pureiinsanity also renata is balanced around the fact she gets support income
[4:16:44] Halofan642: so when u give her non supp income, she gets the benefits of her supportive kit (AS revive, shield, ulti, etc) while also doing damage with gold
[4:17:10] pureiinsanity: yep
[4:17:18] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[4:17:20] NydusHerMain: I don't think that's the right way to analyze it
[4:17:23] NydusHerMain: they just fucked up the numbers
[4:17:27] NydusHerMain: without thinking about the consequences
[4:17:49] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[4:18:01] NydusHerMain: other enchanters don't do much damage with a lot of gold
[4:18:05] GenboGenbo: what rank is this?
[4:18:12] Halofan642: (karma)
[4:18:19] Halofan642: (zyra brand jungle)
[4:18:33] NydusHerMain: yeah but neither are meant to be supports
[4:18:36] NydusHerMain: renata is meant to be a support
[4:18:45] NydusHerMain: zyra designed for mid, brand designed for mid
[4:18:46] Halofan642: (naut mid)
[4:18:50] milkis9098: damage lulu hehehe
[4:18:52] NydusHerMain: renata designed for support
[4:18:58] NydusHerMain: naut designed for jungle
[4:18:59] cheesewhiz15: this Ant guy is funnny
[4:19:08] cameron416: naut used to be a jg lol
[4:19:14] ChimeZee: i love ants
[4:19:14] pureiinsanity: honnestly nydus i think this would still be viable if they halfed her passive AP ratio
[4:19:17] NydusHerMain: you're listing champs that weren't designed for support
[4:19:27] NydusHerMain: yeah I agree
[4:19:31] Halofan642: soraka and karma both good solo laners
[4:19:33] NydusHerMain: the % health damage is too good
[4:19:40] milkis9098: @genbogenbo i think this is masters unless i am mistaken
[4:19:46] cameron416: lulu used to have viability mid/top
[4:19:48] Halofan642: naut designed for jg i’ll be honest i’ve never seen this champ jg
[4:20:00] NydusHerMain: karma was designed as a mid as well
[4:20:08] Halofan642: when was naut released ? season 3?
[4:20:08] NydusHerMain: lulu was viable and they noticed and removed her ratios
[4:20:15] pureiinsanity: its cuz minions blocked pix
[4:20:30] NydusHerMain: renata will be nerfed soon enough
[4:20:31] RustyTyrano: pretty sure this pyke doesn't know what his buttons do
[4:20:35] GenboGenbo: win traders
[4:20:41] NydusHerMain: fun is not allowed
[4:20:54] NydusHerMain: it'll happen
[4:21:03] pureiinsanity: she will be nerfed
[4:21:04] Halofan642: how many supports were designed for support
[4:21:11] pureiinsanity: when ppl catch on
[4:21:16] bulwak1992: naut can still jungle effectively @Halofan642 there are just champs that do it better
[4:21:30] NydusHerMain: sona, soraka, janna, braum, blitz, renata, etc. etc.
[4:21:57] Halofan642: so like half probably?
[4:22:01] Halofan642: what a funny role bro
[4:22:08] NydusHerMain: more than half
[4:22:12] pureiinsanity: mejai is a bit sus
[4:22:13] cameron416: cleanse getting no respect lmao
[4:22:20] pureiinsanity: cuz eventually they realize
[4:22:24] NydusHerMain: pyke, lulu, nami, more nad more
[4:22:28] Halofan642: was zilean a support?
[4:22:38] NydusHerMain: no he was mid
[4:22:46] coolwaveofcalm: I fought an insane rengar last night, so assuming they know what they're doing you should be fine
[4:23:09] coolwaveofcalm: because lethality is broken with the new items
[4:23:24] Halofan642: oh did karma become a support after her mini rework she had years ago
[4:23:30] Halofan642: cuz her e used to burst like ivern right
[4:23:43] NydusHerMain: of the list I'm looking at
[4:23:44] Halofan642: or did they play her support and they reworked her to be more supportive as a result?
[4:23:53] NydusHerMain: 11/29 supports were released for other roles
[4:24:02] NydusHerMain: karma wasn't really used at all tbh
[4:24:11] NydusHerMain: they reworked her cuz her kit was meh
[4:25:23] pureiinsanity: yes
[4:25:27] pureiinsanity: when i play this
[4:25:33] pureiinsanity: both enemies and teammmates so confused
[4:26:17] coolwaveofcalm: Renata is such a baller
[4:26:35] coolwaveofcalm: I love how much swagger she hase
[4:26:36] Halofan642: would u soloq this ?
[4:26:38] NydusHerMain: I've been playing janna top a lot in norms
[4:26:43] NydusHerMain: not even wave clear -> roam, just W max
[4:27:02] ouranhshc: FeelsBadMan
[4:27:15] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 he soloq'd this today
[4:27:21] NydusHerMain: janna is probably good with this
[4:27:27] Halofan642: as farmer ?
[4:27:29] CassianG: what rank are you rn Erm
[4:27:34] pureiinsanity: @NydusHerMain shes not
[4:27:43] Halofan642: does janna give me still?
[4:27:45] Halofan642: MS*
[4:27:51] NydusHerMain: what's the antisynergy?
[4:28:04] pureiinsanity: janna gives AD
[4:28:08] pureiinsanity: and no way to proc passive
[4:28:13] pureiinsanity: for renata easily
[4:28:14] NydusHerMain: janna doesn't have to play back
[4:28:19] Halofan642: the janna ms would be nice i think
[4:28:23] NydusHerMain: if I'm playing with you I don't think janna would be optimal
[4:28:27] THE_Bacon90: DiscoDoge
[4:28:31] NydusHerMain: but with 5 who misses half the wave, he needs the AD
[4:28:50] pureiinsanity: @NydusHerMain xd
[4:28:56] Halofan642: nice man he suggested janna just to flame his csing
[4:29:05] pureiinsanity: i played this when it was double support item meta @5up
[4:29:08] pureiinsanity: easy to farm
[4:29:10] Halofan642: i respect the flame
[4:29:12] pureiinsanity: when u have support item
[4:29:15] NydusHerMain: LOL I actually think janna would be fine
[4:29:21] NydusHerMain: really good chase
[4:29:36] Halofan642: the funniest part is you one shot the wave
[4:29:54] karazan145: when did 5up start playing league?
[4:30:02] pureiinsanity: look at your shield's Strength @5up
[4:30:04] NydusHerMain: she might also just be good
[4:30:10] NydusHerMain: and not need support synergy
[4:30:12] NydusHerMain: tbh
[4:30:28] vDaishar: Idk why they're extending the game
[4:30:47] Halofan642: welcome to playing support champs man
[4:30:52] pureiinsanity: Vow is also good
[4:30:55] pureiinsanity: even on ranged
[4:30:57] veryShiny: veryShiny subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! woowee
[4:31:03] Halofan642: i’ve played hundreds of karma games and every game someone doesn’t know what my e does. or how much damage i do.
[4:31:31] NydusHerMain: JAW DROPPED AGAIN
[4:31:31] cherryita_: holy shittt
[4:31:38] zatyna_: wp
[4:31:47] niightdancer: Woah
[4:31:52] NydusHerMain: @Halofan642 as someone who rarely plays with or vs karma
[4:31:55] coolwaveofcalm: Renata is just that bitch
[4:31:55] NydusHerMain: the fucking W heal
[4:31:59] NydusHerMain: is always a jump scare
[4:32:00] ouranhshc: KEKW

[4:32:08] cheesewhiz15: what's the tldr on the renata?
[4:32:17] coolwaveofcalm: RENATA IS THAT BITCH
[4:32:27] Beemittens: thats insane
[4:32:30] Halofan642: yeah the karma w heal mostly scares the enemy, but playing her solo lane sometimes your jungler/whoever doesnt know you will live and just leave u
[4:32:33] cheesewhiz15: what does lulu do for you? lol
[4:32:39] Halofan642: those are more tilting but they happen less if that makes sense
[4:33:03] blazin_barbie: bard of inspiration
[4:33:06] pureiinsanity: @cheesewhiz15 pix procs renata passive
[4:33:07] Halofan642: the worst is when i’m giving someone my e to go in and fight and they just fucking run it’s like bro enchanters suck
[4:33:48] coolwaveofcalm: Lol the Pantheon friended
[4:33:48] Halofan642: also lulu is THE pocket champion

[4:34:08] pellepingo: It's really funny, yesterday YouTube recommend a video called "Why nobody plays Renata anymore"
[4:34:19] bulwak1992: zilian ali/sion was always fun
[4:34:23] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 it works with other stuff like amumu
[4:34:34] THE_Bacon90: ah ok, it was disabled yesterday
[4:34:44] Halofan642: what makes amumu good? just the lockdown?
[4:34:55] pureiinsanity: his passive
[4:34:59] Halofan642: OH FUCK

[4:35:07] Halofan642: YEAH THATS RIFHT I FORGOT HE HAD THAT
[4:35:20] Halofan642: yeah it converts magic to true damage right?
[4:35:26] veryShiny: ok
[4:35:29] veryShiny: whyu is this working?
[4:35:30] pureiinsanity: @Halofan642 yes
[4:35:43] bulwak1992: @Halofan642 amumu passive does like 10% magic to true
[4:35:46] Halofan642: yeah amumu sound’s funny
[4:35:59] Halofan642: bro it’s because she’s a support all supports are overturned idc what u support players say
