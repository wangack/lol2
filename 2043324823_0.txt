[1:27:49] KatelynnBlackwood: not which team is better, which is worse
[1:27:59] boislads: Yo chase, I need some tips for grubs. How the fuck do I play around the 5 mins grub as shaco, I get murdered by them. Its also hard when top/mid have no prio, but thats a whole other issue
[1:30:37] Rebtiz42: It's pizza time
[1:30:41] Quaetro_LoL: @boislads not chase but heres a tip: at around 5 mins you should already have your tiamat, E the first grub and pull all three near the entrance of the pit. put your box behind you and it should atleast target 2 or even 3 grubs if you pull them correctly
[1:31:56] boislads: @boislads Okay, so I usually dont have tiamat, so that makes sense. I guess I need to reset at 1200gold every time. As for the mechanic of pulling them out, I would need a visual guide lol
[1:32:14] boislads: I understand your explanation, but the grubs always just stay where they are
[1:33:20] drigers5: it's up there, but windwall's dumber
[1:33:30] Quaetro_LoL: @boislads just pull them so that they sort of clump together, still it takes a long time to clear them as shaco
[1:33:49] boislads: Do I have to like pull them out of pit like drake to get them to stack?
[1:34:10] Quaetro_LoL: @boislads just near the entrance of the pit, they should still be inside
[1:34:13] donjon1984: nother 35+ min game
[1:34:42] boislads: Yeah but they dont walk down towards me, cause they just kinda fuck around and spawn their little shits
[1:34:45] boislads: they dont move down
[1:35:15] RickyTheRainFrog: Morning chase, love you quantLove
[1:35:22] KatelynnBlackwood: is master tier league of legends mechanical outplay. or babysitting.
[1:35:35] ChaseShaco: what time do grubs spawn
[1:35:36] KatelynnBlackwood: you decide
[1:35:40] boislads: 5 mins grub spawn
[1:35:44] ChaseShaco: whts the standard gold
[1:35:44] shacobako: bruh i lost my 10 last games
[1:35:45] ChaseShaco: there
[1:35:47] ChaseShaco: 1100?
[1:35:53] al3in711: pinkward was so happy with the changes
[1:35:53] boislads: apparently tiamat
[1:35:55] shacobako: shaco some how feels weak
[1:35:55] Nightbot: is an anagram for chaos
[1:35:58] ChaseShaco: lvl 5 tiamat?
[1:36:08] boislads: yeah idk, chatter said so
[1:36:17] PurpleJaeden: Yes 1 clear and kill is tiamat
[1:36:19] boislads: I usually never have it
[1:37:25] boislads: maybe double long sword boots is what u have
[1:37:36] boislads: but u def dont have tiamat by 1st grub spawn
[1:38:02] Quaetro_LoL: yah
[1:38:05] Kulhema: at 5 minutes when they actually spawn they have 1.5k hp
[1:38:06] PurpleJaeden: Level up over time right

[1:38:26] dadoey: its not 5 MINS YET
[1:38:26] Tobias6363: fast speed forward
[1:38:27] JemBlocks: they dont spawn with 750 hp
[1:38:29] DolhaFTW: timer at 5 min
[1:38:29] dadoey: fast foward to 5 mins
[1:38:41] Quaetro_LoL: pull them with your e
[1:38:42] boislads: yeah u def can have tiamat by then, but its not every game type case
[1:38:45] Kulhema: Btw I tried Tiamat vs Pickaxe Longsword and both took the same time to take them
[1:38:52] dadoey: at 5mins they lvel up

[1:40:14] ChaseShaco: it isnt that bad
[1:40:19] boislads: not to mention everyone on the map converges to grubs when they spawn
[1:40:22] ChaseShaco: its doable
[1:40:28] JonathanRoids: perma banned OMEGALUL
[1:40:40] Kulhema: Try pickaxe longsword vs Tiamat, both take the same time to finish grubs
[1:40:50] ChaseShaco: why would i want
[1:40:51] Nightbot: because
[1:40:55] ChaseShaco: pickaxe long sword
[1:40:59] ChaseShaco: more combo dmg?
[1:41:05] ChaseShaco: single target?
[1:41:07] boislads: a big part of it is the fact that whole enemy team shows up as well
[1:41:16] boislads: like solo, its not bad for sure
[1:41:21] boislads: but their mid/top always pull up
[1:41:23] boislads: and I just cringe
