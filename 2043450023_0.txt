[1:55:23] MasonAshe: 0/8/1 he finally helped
[1:55:32] anasuuuu: @canoeingbalky why
[1:56:09] canoeingbalky: her basic attackspeed is just so slow. 0.4 is criminal
[1:57:04] canoeingbalky: and if you build AP, unless you snowball early, is just so irrelevant. can‚Äôt match any adc, tanks or other mages in sidelanes
[1:57:34] slaughter78788: downt be such a pesimistic doomer
[1:57:40] slaughter78788: LB is still playable
[1:57:48] slaughter78788: and also will be playable next patch
[1:58:03] canoeingbalky: if riot just buffed her basic AS just like 0.1/0.2 would make all the difference. what‚Äôs happens next patch?

[3:22:28] Oni_Ky: @bobqinxd fair, but how you end games with judt poke? u have to get a team with brains right? I want to learn ad Leblanc and I do well but I just cant carry plat games with that and with ap I can. I know its a me problemX but I want to understand
[3:23:59] WwRoberxW: @Nuzzleh we have to rush ludens now but that item is trash, too many midlane buffed champions like zed and they killed LB core item
[3:24:01] Oni_Ky: ty I ll try improving
[3:25:25] Nuzzleh: @WwRoberxW Yeah I figured Ludens would be the new option but that feels so bad on Leblanc

[3:52:10] Nightbot: bob is contractually obligated to run ads by Team Liquid and Twitch or he will get spanked. sorry guys :/
[3:52:11] Nuzzleh: Looking like an AD angle against that team

[3:53:27] Nuzzleh: @Oni_Ky You can't outplay autoattacks but you can very easily counter Leblanc's main source of dmg (her W)
[3:53:37] ChuckeroftheFickens: leave stream on please
[3:53:45] pandafocuss: lingling touch his ding
[3:54:15] SystemFlamme6000: last guuyys name was gorillajones
[3:57:18] Nuzzleh: Instant mental reset
[3:57:35] Oni_Ky: that our boy for ya
[3:58:01] reza_zack: -3
[3:58:43] reza_zack: typical fizz player
[3:58:50] tibbersssssss: Inter?
[3:58:51] CrazyFugee: xd
[3:58:53] Nuzzleh: NA Masters Fizz
[3:59:46] Oni_Ky: that‚Äôs what this game does.. is making us feel misserable but then we WIN win win and so on.. its a dopamine rollercoaster.. misserable ADDICTION
[4:01:25] Nuzzleh: What happened to Corrupt pot + Time Warp Tonic btw? That used to be good iirc
[4:01:39] Oni_Ky: if I look at *** i get like team with 60 percent winrzte vs teams with 40 and vice verca. games are not balanced anymore. thats the feeling I get playing this game
[4:01:53] Oni_Ky: op dot gg*
[4:02:24] eqquilibriuum: sup bob, how is leblanc this season? i play rengar and he is beyond unfair right now, dont see to many LB's tho
[4:02:39] eqquilibriuum: low master
[4:02:42] Oni_Ky: lb is ass
[4:02:54] eqquilibriuum: @Oni_Ky really?
[4:03:04] Oni_Ky: kind off yea
[4:03:12] tibbersssssss: Why is nobody going flask anymore?
[4:03:25] Nightbot: join my discord server if ur awesome: https://discord.gg/bobqinxd
[4:03:46] eqquilibriuum: @Oni_Ky yeah damn, 46% wr masters+.. any reason for that? i feel ap burst items are strong
[4:04:06] Nuzzleh: Time warp tonic is still in the game though, was corrupt pot nerfed?
[4:04:14] Nightbot: Did you know that you can sub to Bobqinxd for FREE!!!! with Amazon Prime? try it now. https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[4:04:39] Oni_Ky: I mean she still works if you‚Äôre good at lb obviously. but compared to other champs she is really weak. you have to put a lot more effort winning in her then on other champs if that makes sense
[4:04:59] eqquilibriuum: @Oni_Ky yeah, like kata fizz for example
[4:05:07] Oni_Ky: ap burst is good imo but she get outscaled really fast
[4:05:18] eqquilibriuum: hmm thats unfair for u guys
[4:05:25] eqquilibriuum: im thriving on the rengar jg
[4:05:31] eqquilibriuum: unreal broken right now
[4:06:19] peronometro: hes peak was rank 4 actually
[4:06:37] Oni_Ky: is rengo like op now?
[4:06:51] eqquilibriuum: @Oni_Ky beyond
[4:06:57] NZLmonster: bobqinAgent1
[4:06:57] eqquilibriuum: z+ tier
[4:07:17] Oni_Ky: haha that‚Äôs nice if you play h tho :p
[4:07:24] eqquilibriuum: i do B)
[4:07:47] Oni_Ky: u got this bob!
[4:07:52] eqquilibriuum: new lethality items so broken right now, i try to get gm before they nerf
[4:08:03] konenio: Rengar is broken
[4:08:34] eqquilibriuum: @konenio yeah but its in reality just profane hydra, hubris and opportunity item
[4:08:45] peronometro: !opgg
[4:08:45] Nightbot: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/NA/bobqinDX
[4:09:23] Oni_Ky: but in what day then? I mean yea he one shots as he should. but after that he is not much of a treat imo? if ur team knows how to group and punish
[4:09:31] j2duhr: 1v1 me bro
[4:09:40] Oni_Ky: but I agree profane hydra is stupid asf
[4:09:54] eqquilibriuum: @Oni_Ky yeah exactly, if he has bush he will destroy you but in open space he is 0
[4:09:59] wwolfyyuwu: omg the cat is so cutee
[4:10:03] wwolfyyuwu: :3
[4:10:21] eqquilibriuum: i cant even count how many games i've lost going 20-0 and my team randomly force 3 fights in a row in midlane where i cant join and we lose
[4:10:37] eqquilibriuum: all rengar players know the feeling, its legit like getting castrated
[4:11:36] Oni_Ky: its just the assasin role tho. u have to 1v9 or have a team with braincells
[4:12:35] eqquilibriuum: @Oni_Ky yeah for sure, its just a bit annoying not being able to fight wherever u want, but his strength in bushes makes up for it üíÄ
[4:13:00] Oni_Ky: truee
[4:13:07] eqquilibriuum: rengar has without a doubt the fastest and highest single target dmg combo in the entire game
[4:13:15] eqquilibriuum: but he has 0 escape after kill, only assassin without it
[4:13:33] eqquilibriuum: that's the way they tried to nerf him when designing it idk
[4:14:38] eqquilibriuum: wondering if that tahm felt disrespected btw
[4:15:21] Oni_Ky: just be wary on when to engage. u dont always have to engage first and trie to get stacked w up after the kill
[4:16:33] eqquilibriuum: good timing and fast mechanics  are a must
[4:16:46] eqquilibriuum: but at the end of the day, yeah he is disgusting
[4:17:05] leblvnt: nooooice gameeee
[4:17:13] crewmateghost: yooooo
[4:17:22] eqquilibriuum: but the most broken pick in the game is ivern supp
[4:17:24] eqquilibriuum: not kidding
[4:17:30] Oni_Ky: @bobqinxd so this is the power of ad lb? or where u just absurtly fed this game!m? btw told you to play one more ;) WP
