[0:15:09] Galkaria: half of america is considered obese, that's not really an insult anymore LUL
[0:22:41] Zerowaffles: Haven't played since s13 is lethality shaco dead atm?
[0:24:14] Galkaria: @Zerowaffles it's not in style right now, with how the meta currently is people are stacking damage more than tanky stats
[0:25:32] Zerowaffles: @Galkaria If everyone is stacking dmg, can't you one shot more easily then?
[0:25:42] Zerowaffles: sorry I have no idea what the items are atm
[0:25:43] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[0:26:03] Galkaria: lethality is basically just another word for armour pen, so having overall less armour means the pen isn't -as- needed
[0:26:49] shacobako: brand jgl is the cure vs this lillia
[0:26:50] Galkaria: there's about 10 or so new items added this season, bunch of alterations so it's hard to list every chance, but yeah, damage is king right now
[0:26:55] Zerowaffles: @Galkaria Isn't the one shot potential on squishy targets less with on hit?
[0:27:17] Zerowaffles: by on hit i mean items like bork etc
[0:27:43] Galkaria: bork is moreso for tank busting and sustained fighting, shaco isn't able to do either of those well currently
[0:28:03] Galkaria: it's either a divebomb 1 shot or a chase into boxes that lead into the divebomb
[0:28:34] shacobako: boosted senna
[0:29:19] shacobako: can you try brand jgl next game ?

[0:38:37] jaizer91: See Rengar isn't as big an issue in gold lol
[0:38:37] false_monk: I think its better to ban lillia
[0:38:40] D3ADLYKANSAS: ahhh
[0:39:07] shacobako: can you try an easy champ game ?
[0:39:09] ChrisRumble: ask teammates to ban her for u
[0:39:19] D3ADLYKANSAS: @ChaseShaco yeah jg most op role too btw kappa
[0:39:21] ChaseShaco: its oaky i have to ban lillia
[0:39:27] ChaseShaco: idk every game is just a flip
[0:39:36] ChaseShaco: last game is impsosible to win
[0:39:37] false_monk: Id rather play against graves or rengar than lillia
[0:39:39] ChaseShaco: from champ selct
[0:39:43] ChaseShaco: regardless of what i ban
[0:39:45] false_monk: The speed, the ap, the cc
[0:39:50] ChaseShaco: the entire enemyt team is playing
[0:39:52] ChaseShaco: aroiund jungle
[0:39:56] false_monk: Fucking hecarim but actually uncounerable
[0:39:56] ChaseShaco: it doesnt matter
[0:40:00] cringezoomerbruh: they should add two bans for every player one is not enough i swear
[0:40:09] jaizer91: Yeah hard to 1v9 rn
[0:40:25] ChaseShaco: its not hard to 1v9 it doesnt exist at a certain point
[0:40:32] ChaseShaco: theres nothing i can do if we dont cover camps
[0:40:37] ChaseShaco: or at elast give me infdo when i ask for it
[0:40:47] ChaseShaco: she one shtos them whil;e running at 5k ms
[0:40:57] ChaseShaco: the enemy is prtotecting camps
[0:40:57] false_monk: Ye jungle is so reliant on your teammates moving
[0:41:00] ChaseShaco: so i cannot play the game
[0:41:16] ChaseShaco: i guess i ban lillia
[0:41:17] ChaseShaco: w.e
[0:41:34] false_monk: When I play game with my friends its so different when you have people actually defending yoir jg right when you tell them to
[0:42:11] cringezoomerbruh: just add voice chat to the game
[0:42:18] false_monk: fk no
[0:42:18] jaizer91: That's why I was wondering about the W for clear speed, so your camps are at least down and you're not losing stuff from it
[0:42:29] Galkaria: yup, ranked and competitive league are just 2 different things. if you want the collective teamwork you need to find a team. join one or find friends, but ranked will always just be a grind
[0:42:56] Brittykittie: HI CHASE
[0:42:59] CESlush: @cringezoomerbruh I thought they did that, no one uses it?
[0:43:00] Brittykittie: do you think there's any world ap is playable again
[0:43:13] jaizer91: VC is only for your premade party
[0:43:28] ChaseShaco: right now
[0:43:29] ChaseShaco: no
[0:43:35] Brittykittie: :(
[0:43:37] false_monk: @ChaseShaco What do you think about clone changes? For me it feels like my close half of the time just exists and nothing else
[0:43:39] ChaseShaco: ap shaco will return when they inevitably
[0:43:43] Brittykittie: thats what i thought
[0:43:43] ChaseShaco: change all the ap iotems
[0:43:48] ChaseShaco: because control mages
[0:43:49] Galkaria: it'll return like AP yi LUL
[0:43:50] ChaseShaco: dont exist right now
[0:43:57] ChaseShaco: when orianna comes back ap shaco comes bacjk
[0:44:10] ChaseShaco: they wont leave ap items liuke this
[0:44:43] Brittykittie: this is good news
[0:44:53] Brittykittie: do you think they'll fix the clone bug lol
[0:45:01] ChaseShaco: yeah not till next patch
[0:45:18] ChaseShaco: i talked to phlox
[0:45:26] Brittykittie: oh wow ok
[0:45:35] Brittykittie: the hero we needed
[0:45:44] ChaseShaco: not rly
[0:45:45] false_monk: good intend with changes but gosh
[0:45:45] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[0:45:46] ChaseShaco: was kinda annoying
[0:45:49] ChaseShaco: atm
[0:46:01] ChaseShaco: idk why they touched clone in the first place
[0:46:10] false_monk: even my teammates in soloQ laughed at me cuz it looked like i dont know that my close cana actually autoattack
[0:46:16] ChaseShaco: its the first QoL shaco change that i didnt talk to phlox about
[0:46:19] ChaseShaco: and they just ruin clone
[0:46:22] CESlush: at least they take feedback from people they know are knowledgeable
[0:46:24] ChaseShaco: for a mechanic that isnt even good
[0:46:42] ChaseShaco: meanwhile we still cant get adaptive damage on e
[0:46:47] ChaseShaco: for reasons beyond me
[0:46:55] false_monk: because then shaco OP
[0:46:56] Brittykittie: you don't think clone prioritizing champs after death was good?
[0:47:07] ChaseShaco: good game design is allowing a hexdrinker to save someones life from an ad assassin shaco
[0:47:11] ChaseShaco: because that makes sense
[0:47:35] ChaseShaco: i thjink its a great idea
[0:47:41] false_monk: lmao yea
[0:47:42] ChaseShaco: but releasing it like this
[0:47:48] ChaseShaco: is hilariuously stupid
[0:47:51] cringezoomerbruh: wait thats a thing lol
[0:47:55] ChaseShaco: they either didnt test it
[0:48:00] ChaseShaco: or literally didnt know hjow to test it
[0:48:02] CESlush: I was just gonna say, did they even realize it?
[0:48:04] ChaseShaco: i suspect the latter
[0:48:22] CESlush: they should pay you test shaco changes haha
[0:48:26] ChaseShaco: idk its a change thats made for pink wards synapse clips
[0:48:31] ChaseShaco: prety much useless
[0:48:33] ChaseShaco: for actual gameplay
[0:48:44] false_monk: Well good for him at least
[0:48:53] jaizer91: I think it's supposed to re-apply spell blade to clone
[0:49:02] jaizer91: Idk how useful that is
[0:49:06] ChaseShaco: clone having spell blade doenstg even make sense
[0:49:18] ChaseShaco: because it cant use moves
[0:49:18] Brittykittie: orly i feel like clone just sitting there afk after death makes me so sad so often even on ad
[0:49:24] dottorpippo: When you play?
[0:49:27] ChaseShaco: but pink ward is biased in what he askjs for
[0:50:01] lovolife: I am so satisfied :D
[0:50:14] false_monk: Ye if the ap changes would delete ad shaco he would be okay with it
[0:50:19] LeeSinMidAndFeed: PotFriend hi
[0:50:31] false_monk: Hello there
[0:50:38] ChaseShaco: heres the thing he doesnt acknowledge that ad shaco is the intended design of the character
[0:50:43] Nightbot: join chaseshaco's discord using the link https://discord.gg/chaseshaco

[0:50:51] ChaseShaco: and unique
[0:50:56] ChaseShaco: but u cant make changes that impact
[0:51:03] ChaseShaco: ad shaco playing correctly
[0:51:08] ChaseShaco: for ap shaco montage moments
[0:51:09] false_monk: I like ap shaco because he was very good against dive comps
[0:51:10] ChaseShaco: in diamond
[0:51:13] jaizer91: Seems weird when it's like a knockoff teemo imo
[0:51:15] h8_6: ya
[0:51:19] false_monk: You just place boxes and enemy outplays themselves
[0:51:19] CESlush: In past seasons, I tend to enjoy AP shaco more, just more fun
[0:51:20] ChaseShaco: its the first qol change that didnt come from me
[0:51:24] ChaseShaco: and it immediately broke clone
[0:51:27] ChaseShaco: surprise !
[0:52:08] cringezoomerbruh: what should ad shaco get
[0:52:14] false_monk: But for me ad shaco is more fun than ap
[0:52:42] false_monk: bets that graves will be picked?
[0:52:42] h8_6: graves tabi, very fun

[0:56:08] dottorpippo: Why Is zoom monitor ? 😅
[0:56:11] Nightbot: because
[0:56:11] false_monk: @egzokassa Since when do you balance the game around bad players?
[0:56:35] false_monk: WHat?
[0:56:42] false_monk: How does that make even sense?
[0:56:44] Nightbot: is an anagram for chaos
[0:56:54] false_monk: With that logic challanger players a re the worst ones
[0:56:54] jaizer91: That's just not how balance works in this game lol
[0:56:55] CESlush: because most players are bad? I guess
[0:56:58] false_monk: Because there is so few of them
[0:57:01] Galkaria: @CESlush league has been balance between competitive league that have teams competing for a trophy, and they also balance for the ranked climbers, you can't play ranked anything close to what you play competitive league
[0:57:59] kykirskuraitaiyo: If Lightrocket know that it is you he would do his lackey for jungle special strategy

[2:03:43] shacobako: can you check hubris item as  start ?
[2:03:48] shacobako: after buff
[2:03:55] shacobako: many champs start it
[2:03:58] penguinslmao: I feel like I missed some sweet drama and I can't find what it is. I'll have to watch the vod
[2:03:58] ChaseShaco: when did they buff it
[2:04:01] ChaseShaco: shaco needs tiamat to clear
[2:04:01] Nightbot: is an anagram for chaos
[2:04:10] ChaseShaco: if we were gonan get hubris
[2:04:11] ChaseShaco: itd be 2nd

[2:04:29] ChaseShaco: if uir teams good its prob good when theyre not its bad
[2:04:33] karar06190: @ChaseShaco will profane still be good after the bonus low health dmg nerf?
[2:04:34] ChaseShaco: ap shaco isnt playable rn
[2:04:39] ibronto: scrub goes profane hubris every game
[2:04:41] ChaseShaco: items are dogshti
[2:04:42] ibronto: but shaco is not rengar ofc
[2:04:45] ChaseShaco: its rengar haha
[2:04:56] ChaseShaco: he cant guarantee getting kills as well as
[2:05:01] ChaseShaco: doesnt need attack speed statr
[2:05:05] CESlush: So, who you got for the super bowl this year?
[2:05:10] ChaseShaco: ravens ofc
[2:05:17] ChaseShaco: im in louisville baby
[2:05:20] x9Dane: Response to the allegations that you smell really bad? @chaseshaco
[2:05:28] ChaseShaco: watched lamar from the sidelines my freshman yr
[2:05:36] prnmeds: I did always wonder if you had noticed the tweets from the warriors account xD
[2:05:38] ChaseShaco: id say allegations from a random
[2:05:40] ChaseShaco: do not hurt me
[2:05:40] karar06190: guys new ap shaco build idea, simply lock in eve jg
[2:05:44] ChaseShaco: yeah i did haha

[2:06:02] prnmeds: got that clout lmao
[2:06:04] prnmeds: ridiculous
[2:06:05] CESlush: Ravens are definitely tough.  I like Purdy's story, it'd be fun to see SF win.  But, my team isn't in it, so, I mostly just want to see a good game.
[2:06:06] jaizer91: I'll root for the chiefs before I root for the lions but I'm also a hater

[2:06:24] ChaseShaco: i definitely think itll be closer
[2:06:25] jaizer91: I'm sleepwalking
[2:06:28] jaizer91: Ravens
[2:06:28] ChaseShaco: but idk
[2:06:32] ChaseShaco: ravens are the full package
[2:06:39] ChaseShaco: lamar has become so dangerous
[2:06:59] ChaseShaco: can keep plays al;ive for so long and just run for an 80 yd touchdown himselfd
[2:07:01] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[2:07:06] ChaseShaco: so insanekly hard to play defenmse against this
[2:07:12] ChaseShaco: trying to play man coverage for 20s
[2:08:17] karar06190: we simply go profane farm and pray our laners win their lane since our champ is a minion
[2:08:34] ChaseShaco: just prio farm rn
[2:08:35] prnmeds: deebo a limited participant in practice today
[2:08:36] ChaseShaco: games last longer
[2:08:39] CESlush: no team this fell apart quite like my team
[2:08:47] CESlush: Eagles were hard to watch
[2:08:50] ChaseShaco: bro
[2:08:50] Nightbot: bro
[2:08:54] ChaseShaco: cowboys fan here
[2:08:56] ChaseShaco: im with yhou
[2:09:00] ChaseShaco: hahahaaha
[2:09:03] TheBearness: How are you a Cowboys fan?
[2:09:06] ChaseShaco: wym
[2:09:08] jaizer91: Hubris dark harvest absolute focus until you become a death bomb
[2:09:31] corrie0870: cowboys didn’t fall apart packers just showed up and stomped
[2:09:34] CESlush: You kind of expect that out of the cowboys though? Every year is there year until round 1 of the play offs
[2:09:37] ChaseShaco: nah they fell apart lol
[2:09:44] TheBearness: ahhh I see.
[2:09:49] ChaseShaco: cowboys were 8/0 at home
[2:09:52] TheBearness: "America's Team:
[2:09:59] ChaseShaco: packers improved but
[2:09:59] CESlush: If Jerry Jones would quite tryin gto be a GM, the Cowboys might win super bowls again
[2:10:02] ChaseShaco: giving up
[2:10:04] ChaseShaco: 40 points lol
[2:10:06] ChaseShaco: is falling apart.
[2:10:15] ChaseShaco: esp when ur supposed to be one of the top defenses
[2:10:18] ChaseShaco: playing at home
[2:10:24] jaizer91: Cowboys tilted irl
[2:10:31] ChaseShaco: idk im used to it
[2:10:31] TheBearness: Meanwhile the Falcons just pissed away a HC hire
[2:10:39] ChaseShaco: which one
[2:10:41] corrie0870: that’s disrespectful as fuck to packers.
[2:10:44] Shinobic: @ChaseShaco What do you think of the multiple Haunted Mask build?
[2:10:47] ChaseShaco: what are u on abouty lol
[2:10:49] Shinobic: for AP
[2:10:54] ChaseShaco: the packers were
[2:10:58] ChaseShaco: average at best all year
[2:10:59] corrie0870: they also were the better team vs the niners
[2:11:02] ChaseShaco: yes they look a lot better
[2:11:05] ChaseShaco: and have improved a lot
[2:11:10] ChaseShaco: they are like 8 rookies
[2:11:15] ChaseShaco: niners looked very off
[2:11:18] corrie0870: doesn’t matter what you look like in the year matters what you bring to the post.
[2:11:22] ChaseShaco: and looked even worse
[2:11:25] ChaseShaco: with deebo out
[2:11:32] ChaseShaco: i like the packers i think its cool how well they did
[2:11:34] ChaseShaco: but relax
[2:11:36] ChaseShaco: lol
[2:11:45] ChaseShaco: they arent there yet
[2:11:50] TheBearness: Crazy how some of the early front runners just completely collapsed on themselves.
[2:11:58] CESlush: One thing I'll say about Cowboys, is Lamb is scary good.  I feel like he makes Dak look better than he actually is.
[2:12:06] ChaseShaco: lamb is rtly good
[2:12:08] maelstromvo: how are the games today sir
[2:12:11] ChaseShaco: amnd dak has gotten a lot better
[2:12:12] TheBearness: @CESlush 100000%
[2:12:16] ChaseShaco: defnse has fallen apart
[2:12:20] ChaseShaco: moreso than dak choking
[2:12:27] ChaseShaco: but people always blame him
[2:12:33] jaizer91: If it turns out Jordan Love is actually their dude then it's not a fluke but right now that's tough to tell
[2:12:38] TheBearness: easiest to blame the qb
[2:12:42] ChaseShaco: i dont think hes a fluke
[2:12:52] ChaseShaco: i think that team will be superbowl contrenders
[2:12:54] ChaseShaco: within 3 years
[2:13:04] ChaseShaco: i do think they were playnig a bit over their head
[2:13:09] ChaseShaco: is all
[2:13:14] ChaseShaco: also niners looked really off
[2:13:31] karar06190: bro chase im gonna watch your    new vid guides on youtube, please dont stop posting them,  for me and my low elo shaco brothers we need em.

[2:15:39] lovolife: @ChaseShaco youtube videos Kreygasm
[2:15:42] CESlush: will beat*
[2:15:47] corrie0870: joes gone we are the contender next year.  we got 60 mil in cap coming in.  granted if we throw all that at love then we fucked. won’t have any money to keep or get players.
[2:15:48] karar06190: help me a lot of people chase
[2:15:50] karar06190: keep it up
[2:16:00] karar06190: and*
[2:17:07] jaizer91: I tbh just want Kenny Pickett gone so I can watch the Steelers again
[2:17:35] CESlush: Look at the Eagles this year. They had a roster, but, their coaching and play calling..... holy
[2:17:50] ursowo: Hey chase, hey chat
[2:17:53] CESlush: but, when you lose your OC and DC to head coaching jobs, you never know what you'll get
[2:18:24] CESlush: They had real coordinators two years ago
[2:18:31] CESlush: They lost both to head coaching jobs
[2:19:03] CESlush: I was saying that all year, they ahve 4 RBs on their roster, and didn't use half of them
[2:19:09] CESlush: Scott and Penny didn't see game time, ever
[2:19:36] Galkaria: it always struck me as weird that teams import players, growing up i always assumed teams played for the areas they lived in, but it's just buying power
[2:20:09] CESlush: All teams have the same salary cap
[2:20:39] CESlush: It was much more buying power pre-salary cap era, which is why Jerry Jones won back then....
