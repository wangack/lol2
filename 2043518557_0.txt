[7:34:32] EgyptianOverlord: no jinxes can throw in backpack battles, clearly the superior game
[7:34:50] xcharliehustle: 4 AP and the one AD is a jinx vs. Diana, Olaf, Vi
[7:34:53] eternalxchief: if they play for scale they win, but jinx had mechanically braindead mechanics
[7:34:54] jordanmon18: I really dislike briar feet
