[0:50:35] bigbrother0012: we have the power to take them down but we sit in silence
[0:50:42] NapNapoleon: They want ceos to be a normal job, but it's just NOT. But it serves their interest. The rich gets richer.
[0:50:47] Lichyness: that type of severance should be industry standard :(
[0:51:11] Revares: i really appreaciate you speaking for artists on twitter, makes me really appreaciated in this hellish age of ai and capitalism

[0:52:29] wicked_ev: ngl but sh*t happen you just got to move on
[0:52:30] Lichyness: As a consumer, I don't want AI slop idk
[0:52:36] thebeautaeful: mrsavaTroll
[0:52:42] Lichyness: I want quality and AI isnt that
[0:52:47] RapttorX: @DeathSpreads its region based, some get 5 ads, some get none
[0:53:09] thebeautaeful: @Lichyness what about using it for base? starting from ai things and using it as base to speed up the process, whatever it is.
[0:53:09] chipichipichapachapagr: I mostly get ads in replays than live LUL
[0:53:10] gfjelstad: I mean before corps everyone was wayyy more poor though
[0:53:18] DeathSpreads: @RapttorX I often get 5 ads, what I main is it literally took 2 seconds, like they weren't even ads lol

[0:54:59] cogstopper: Ayo camille support? hinaboPausechamp
[0:54:59] Nightbot: taco Ayo Taco
[0:55:04] Lichyness: @thebeautaeful i think there are some decent use cases but using it as a final piece just bc its inexpensive is bad for consumer
[0:55:04] bigbrother0012: why should we accept it at the first place
[0:55:28] NapNapoleon: Support it
[0:55:41] RapttorX: @Jasikyu_ COPIUM its the player that counts, not the hero
[0:55:54] TSONIC: explain yourself, if you have a bussiness and an employee does a horrible job ofc u fire
[0:55:57] thebeautaeful: @thebeautaeful obviously depends on the product!
[0:56:12] LahadVoidTTV: briibe1Cardblicky
[0:56:35] TSONIC: we tallking about a specific bussiness?
[0:56:43] wicked_ev: that was not the same CEO
[0:56:46] klauning: hello chat
[0:56:51] klauning: how are we doing?
[0:56:58] DeathSpreads: you should never hire people thinking "if it doesn't go well imma just lay them off lol", you should always be prepared to reassign them
[0:56:58] RapttorX: Smadge see ? baron was a bad idea ...gets fired
[0:57:06] flux3003: @klauning peepoHey
[0:57:17] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[0:57:19] Lichyness: DUO

[0:57:23] gfjelstad: corps not businesses, small business are different
[0:57:24] Voxtrik: explain the layoffs in league terms
[0:57:31] klauning: "they were basically duo queue partners"
[0:57:33] klauning: bruh
[0:57:34] chiikovita: now why would you say duo partners man
[0:57:36] klauning: think about what you saying
[0:57:39] chiikovita: cant hangout with you anymore
[0:57:44] bigbrother0012: bro explaining in league terms to make it ezier
[0:57:54] Lichyness: duo ran the game down and instead the other teammates got banned
[0:57:55] klauning: @chiikovita man you leaving him to go solo q?
[0:58:14] chiikovita: @chiikovita hes been solo q

[1:01:54] RapttorX: how do you go from electrical engineer to architect ?
[1:01:56] MrSkyRQ: What's the business called?
[1:02:33] akirafudo0655: camille sup?
[1:02:35] Necrophagiah: It sounds like construction more than architecture tbh
[1:02:39] akirafudo0655: is it viable_?
[1:02:41] RapttorX: i mean there are 2 diferent things ...not even one evolving from the other ...well gj for doing it

[1:04:30] ringonokami: bro i like to play adc but is adc a good role to climb in low elo~?
[1:04:56] bigbrother0012: all America cares about is oil LUL
[1:04:57] NapNapoleon: Need boots.
[1:05:12] hamsaz: this is what u are taught at uni always competition
[1:05:20] RapttorX: @bigbrother0012 KKonaW hell yea
[1:05:29] hamsaz: being better than others without thinking of others
[1:05:49] RapttorX: Hmm so how big the company is now ? how many employees ?

[1:08:16] Jeaidfuis: That m7 Camille goes BRRRRRRR
[1:08:17] Revares: catJAM Clap
[1:08:18] bubba5681: bubba5681 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 19 month streak! What's up taco, are the supports better today than yesterday?
[1:09:02] jrevans95: @IKeepItTaco no boots rush?
[1:09:19] puchiro: if you treat the ppl under you well and pay them enough they wont screw you over
[1:09:23] NapNapoleon: We're in a period where people keep on shifting responsability. And one guy takes the fall. It can be anyone.
[1:09:28] manasar: Why they don’t like unions
[1:09:54] orvirith: well trained supports
[1:10:01] Ayycisco_: sir thats a camille
[1:10:07] DeathSpreads: bro think we wouldn't notice him dodging his own Lillia's ball KEKW
[1:10:18] hamsaz: in western world in general
[1:10:38] REAPERxp: Layoffs before quarter end to boost numbers!
[1:10:42] bigbrother0012: tweeter is full with npc
[1:10:51] AuraMistress: Most of the companies laying off report "record profits"
[1:10:54] AuraMistress: They're just greedy
[1:11:08] hamsaz: it’s because people where do focused on profit maximising but now more people focus on sustainability so maybe it gets better in the future
[1:11:09] LobaaChe: Taco hero of the proletariat
[1:11:09] ravenclawlady12: I heard it was because they overhired, due to COVID
[1:11:19] MrSkyRQ: do you wanna buy boots?
[1:11:28] manasar: Twitter is not a good place to begin with
[1:11:28] DeathSpreads: @ravenclawlady12 then it's their problem
[1:11:48] belallaj: what do you mean by unions
[1:11:55] REAPERxp: @ravenclawlady12 Def at tech companies. Someone started hiring and everyone else followed. Then it was like...crap...we don't have anything for them to do....
[1:12:02] AuraMistress: Twitter is a circle jerk for Elon Musk fans and people making ridiculous amounts of money due to nepotism and telling others that you need to work hard to get to where they got, even when they didn't do it themselves
[1:12:05] bigbrother0012: so many ads
[1:12:06] danielantone: danielantone subscribed with Prime. 
[1:12:23] Ephyrel93: Is harvest better then the other one
[1:12:25] REAPERxp: Lol!
[1:12:39] bigbrother0012: @ikeepittaco u made a deal with twitch for all these ads
[1:12:41] RapttorX: peepoRun
[1:12:47] Nuzlocke_Civillian: Aye im here to support taco and all of chat best of luck ikeepitRAREBOI
[1:13:10] LobaaChe: @belallaj worker union is workers teaming up to demand better treatment from their boss
[1:13:35] challengedvay: Atolo taco, do you think youmus and collector is always the first 2 items on Jhin @ikeepittaco
[1:13:50] REAPERxp: Ever seen those antiunion vids? They lie so blatantly. Don't you want an individual voice with your boss? So he can ignore me?
[1:14:10] AuraMistress: Overhiring is mostly lies. They said the same in healthcare and how short staffed were they during the pandemic? And how severely understaffed are they now?
[1:14:11] LobaaChe: @REAPERxp antiunions are vile
[1:14:29] AuraMistress: Unions got us most of the benefits that we're currently losing
[1:15:02] hughjanus9001: people are happy in scandinavia and have like a above 70% union rates
[1:15:10] REAPERxp: @AuraMistress rules and benefits paid in blood, like not being chained in overnight for work
[1:15:31] cogstopper: Man you should teach courses using League terms hinaboPausechamp
[1:15:34] omnitrix925: what item do u go third normally
[1:15:39] puchiro: in the netherlands we have a homeless problem because companies hire ppl from other countries with housing and they get fired and lose there home. its so fucked up
[1:15:50] AuraMistress: @REAPERxp look, the amount of healthcare workers we lost during the pandemic is insane. What did they get for their efforts? A thank you and maybe some subpar hazzard pay?!
[1:16:25] nekoniclaws: as a european, all the campaign donations in the US from companies look exactly like bribes
[1:16:27] hughjanus9001: and also the super liberal US regulation makes me think people in the US are delusional to like living in the US xd
[1:16:34] Jeaidfuis: There's also the issue of bureaucracy distorting communication and resulting in less transparency overall
[1:16:43] Csarkaiser1: I dunno, Unions do get very corrupt in the country I live in.
[1:16:48] ender115: @nekoniclaws thats what they are
[1:17:15] ender115: lobbying is such a fucked concept
[1:17:18] shadowfax100: man ure such a nice person, wish for more pple like you
[1:17:38] Ayycisco_: dam
[1:17:43] NapNapoleon: Damn.
[1:17:45] floreee: floreee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! hi taco ikeepitSHY
[1:17:45] nekoniclaws: :O
[1:17:47] cogstopper: What the fuck
[1:17:53] AuraMistress: @Csarkaiser1 Not all unions are created equal, but they're not positive in the scheme of things. there's actual evidence and scientific studies of labor laws and general worker well-being pre-and-post unions
[1:17:54] RapttorX: EZ 40k
[1:18:23] puchiro: @g1antin i live in zutphen where you at
[1:18:25] Jeaidfuis: Personal responsibility is always a plus
[1:18:32] Ellipsoul: Deadge
[1:18:46] peshecito: Taco ;__; you are a good guy
[1:18:48] NapNapoleon: They really all survived that.
[1:18:53] Csarkaiser1: @AuraMistress In theory they are all good, but when they start getting in touch with politics they tend to go down the toilet and stop caring about the workers.
[1:19:04] hamsaz: why do you think most people are not like this?
[1:19:16] AuraMistress: @Csarkaiser1 Agreed. They should be separate from politics
[1:19:28] hughjanus9001: yeah lobby groups are just greedy people playing politicia
[1:19:29] belallaj: @hamsaz greed
[1:20:05] vandrelan: Reminds me about what happened at Nintendo when the Wii U was failing hard. The CEOs at the time took a pay cut so they wouldn't have to fire staff.
[1:20:10] ezcgamer: a p e
[1:20:23] AuraMistress: The U.S. suffers from a very individualistic mindset vs other countries with a more tribal/social view
[1:20:23] CalculusWizard93: First time chatter. You're so real. Not everyone has to be like thwt
[1:20:23] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D
[1:20:24] cogstopper: @vandrelan yeah, Iwata was a real one for that
[1:20:33] MetroidExperT: I mean companies in NA could take after nintendo, the year they did poorly the CEO and other higher ups just took a paycut rather than laying off people
[1:20:38] kaiserwroth: Americans built their country on greed COPIUM
[1:20:43] MrSkyRQ: anyway, greetings from Jordan
[1:20:46] maant1s: i especially hate the "just business" excuse, it's used as if business was some kinda magical unstoppable force
[1:20:47] puchiro: money corrupts
[1:20:53] Ephyrel93: Is harvest better then fleet footwork?
[1:20:54] peshecito: its easier to follow as sheep than give it a second thought
[1:21:01] brido14: u know taco is enjoying the game when his talking while playing
[1:21:04] Csarkaiser1: The problem with Unions where I live is they get funded by the State so you see where that goes wrong
[1:21:31] hughjanus9001: regulation is super rigid everywhere, its like random luck of what country you were born in
[1:21:50] PolloGuapo_: PixelBob
[1:21:52] ender115: @Csarkaiser1 that sounds fun
[1:22:10] Csarkaiser1: The human is a wolf to the human @IKeepItTaco
[1:22:27] Csarkaiser1: Greed is so in our nature tho xD it's sad
[1:22:30] seehamed: what part of Jordan r u from?
[1:22:40] netheral: pugPls
[1:23:00] AuraMistress: Humans are inherently social creatures functioning as individuals. It just doesn't work in the long run. We benefit as a society more than as individuals
[1:23:16] kaiserwroth: Taco is basically calling us monkeys (I agree) monkaHmm
[1:23:19] pakrat7198: business seppuku
[1:23:23] MetroidExperT: but thats a good culture to have
[1:23:54] puchiro: plus it forces the ceo to accualy try
[1:24:07] ender115: if the ceo isnt responsible then who is?
[1:24:14] cogstopper: The point is how are your employees going to try to do their best if they know they can be fired at the drop of a hat?
[1:24:15] ender115: quite literally the head of the company
[1:24:24] REAPERxp: Iirc, AIG took the bank bailout and distributed amongst the C suites, and were fined for it
[1:24:26] vandrelan: All I'll say is that from everything people have said about Iwata (the CEO at the time) he would have done it by choice.
[1:24:32] ender115: @cogstopper exactly
[1:24:33] MrSkyRQ: ldr
[1:24:55] gunosodo: what about rfc ?
[1:24:58] RapttorX: @ender115 the owner of the company ...they dont have to be the same person
[1:25:03] thechosen___1: is that lilia support?
[1:25:16] pepegalegend27: KEKW
[1:25:18] MrSkyRQ: no one saw that lb flash
[1:25:19] PolloGuapo_: LOL
[1:25:21] shoannn: MingLee
[1:25:24] belallaj: that lb is not very good
[1:25:32] Merrto: no one saw what ?
[1:25:36] hughjanus9001: it's a shame that languages and families and friends are a thing,  otherwise i'd just move to fkn denmark or something, i think they have a nice regulation
[1:25:41] MrSkyRQ: @Merrto exactky
[1:25:55] Merrto: daphYikes daphYikes
[1:25:55] MetroidExperT: exactly, forced or not it was still the correct course of action to take
[1:26:16] Csarkaiser1: I mean morality or correct are fleeting conceprs
[1:26:17] tsuniediting: W taco based boss
[1:26:56] lener311: why is hwei not available?
[1:26:59] RainyRiver: hi taco! RareBoi
[1:27:23] lener311: after 4 buffs xdddd
[1:27:24] hughjanus9001: literally harvard business review posted a few articles about toxic leadership so it's like a known problem that like unqualified leaders are in a high role and don't get fired because some reason
[1:27:29] bandimir: Only 621 AD Kappa
[1:27:32] cogstopper: Everyone should have to work retail at least once in their life to learn some humility and empathy
[1:27:38] nekoniclaws: the companies are self interested to the point that they'd leave america if it broke down
[1:27:49] Revares: @lener311 they layed him off too ikeepitSMILERS
[1:27:52] ragnatheunstable: @cogstopper agreed
[1:27:58] ender115: @cogstopper factuals
[1:27:59] pakrat7198: I think it's something us peasants don't fully understand. The scale of the amount of money the super elite play with is basically unfathomable. If tim cook takes a pay cut, he's still one of the richest people in the world. If one of us gets our pay cut from $15/hr to $13, that makes a HUGE difference
[1:28:02] vandrelan: Wait the baron has a chat too?!? Oh god what are they like ? ikeepitCLOWNBOI
[1:28:08] TyosTrap: what do u think about stormrazor nerfs
[1:28:09] ender115: mandatory retail would do america so much good
[1:28:14] ghostcat_wav: @tsuniediting hi editor O-O
[1:28:23] thechosen___1: that lb
[1:28:27] arcxanna: lb wintrading
[1:28:36] tsuniediting: hello hello o7
[1:28:39] puchiro: i think most ppl dont grow up to be incorruptible but they never get in a place in life where corruption can effect there life
[1:29:02] DoomedTacox: @ikeepittaco u should try lethality cdr ashe it's fun, 1.5s cool down on W with Shojin
[1:29:36] InkyBabaYaga: Ngl this talk lowkey helped me win my game.
[1:29:40] thechosen___1: like America is not corrupt?

[3:42:55] Nightbot: dogshit kerfuckle perma clowning around throwing shit at each other, APES TOGETHER STRONG
[3:42:58] flesh_pedestrian_: off topic, hades music is so good

[3:43:11] lener311: but they playing their role
[3:43:30] pepegalegend27: thats dedication right there
[3:43:43] IIDeadeye: taco i played with hylissang today (one of the best eu sups in the game) and he went 0-11 :(

[3:44:01] twin2_2002: how to make adc even harder xd
[3:44:05] IIDeadeye: we won though lee camp was a bit insane
[3:44:11] IIDeadeye: 5 ganks in 9 min
[3:44:18] JCG_Stealth: so less damage but more speed
[3:44:25] vsmilotic: LUL
[3:44:31] IIDeadeye: @Jazziph he looks for the limits. i like him he played well just unlucky game
[3:44:31] vsmilotic: aoe slow okay LUL
[3:44:50] pepegalegend27: aoe slow would be the most dumb shit ever
[3:44:50] Friestine: This sounds like how I'd design yugioh cards just make em broken !
[3:45:00] khlori: Bro wrote entire essay BRUH
[3:45:02] Chorge77: who let bro cook 💀

[3:45:29] cogstopper: So, make Rell 2? hinaboPausechamp
[3:45:30] ci1967: i literally never seen u play any other role than adc and jhin / vic mid
[3:45:36] ci1967: so i didnt know sry
[3:45:51] envylilgay: I miss Chemtank hec
[3:46:08] pepegalegend27: another karma supp i guess Bedge
[3:46:44] skitter_bb: Taco bringing out the Rammus pick soon with his OK confirmed???
[3:47:04] ci1967: btw do u think omnivamp will make hecarim super strong or it will be a good and not broken buff
[3:47:08] V_1_P_E_R: bro seeing miss fortune in EVERY game, so boring
[3:47:09] Lichyness: i must go, big test early tomorrow.. good night and good luck taco !
[3:47:12] HoleyShirt1: i feel like hec needs something like a fear stack passive or something so he feels more like hes supposed to be feared instead of w.e. tf he is now
[3:48:16] lener311: naaahhh
[3:48:22] HoleyShirt1: the trick is making not feel stat check and more mechanical
[3:48:39] V_1_P_E_R: oh i get it, its just kinda sad(imo) the state of lethality on adcs vs other damage items
[3:48:42] ci1967: tbh nowadays every ad jungler feels playable only when ahead, when champs like draven fiora renek and jax can kill deal tons of dmg when they are behind 1k gold
[3:48:50] Mpolo98: isnt flat hp rune shit ? like you get more with the lvl hp at like lvl 7
[3:48:59] JPerryLive: Do you play dark harvest every game on jhin?
[3:49:34] lener311: thoughts on lethality jinx? xd
[3:49:45] jetstream_salmon: Love this song
[3:50:00] envylilgay: LT jhin tech when?
[3:50:03] ci1967: is it fair that MF Q when bounced deal 150 dmg lvl 1 and dravens auto deals the same lvl 1
[3:50:30] bubbyston: discord
[3:50:41] skitter_bb: MF is point and click, draven you gotta catch axe I guess
[3:50:49] JPerryLive: I play fleet footwork, stormrazor a lot. What is your opinion about that choise? #

[3:54:18] lener311: in euw u pick garen yuumi and nobody cares xd
[3:54:19] Ayycisco_: in game
[3:54:27] Wind_Blade: riot pls rework senna into a full fledged adc so people stop being miserable
[3:54:46] Jazziph: that's because you haven't played with my senna
[3:54:54] Wind_Blade: i did, it was horrible

[4:05:06] lener311: arf arf arf

[4:10:57] waifumainuwu: Genuine question why didnt you take adc champ with senna? Just started playing adc so im wondering
[4:12:00] starsinthevoids: @waifumainuwu You know how an ADC already struggles without peel? Double that. That is now two ADCs without peel, or self-sustain.
[4:12:23] lener311: hoooolyyyyyy

[4:15:44] XIII_Member: Blue Build is BB, therefore, Blue Ba-
[4:15:45] waifumainuwu: @starsinthevoids Ty makes sense. Im not that good at the game and when i uset to play top my botlane would lose to senna adc combo. I want to learn more about bot lane sice i like ADC champs more than any other champs except Kayn.
[4:15:51] Person_Zero: unending despair for more blue
[4:15:57] lener311: such a mess...but I have so much fun... I feel so bad xd
[4:15:57] skitter_bb: just had a stupid lore idea, imagine if Veigar apprenticed under Jhin but it was Veigar thinking he was trying to teach Jhin to be truly evil
[4:16:06] UrbanPlanner69: why is he playing nasus? anyone?
[4:16:13] jonbrev: What's the purple hand icon on the status bar?

[4:17:03] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune sounds valid
[4:17:23] XIII_Member: Goes by he/him 'cause he's trying to emulate Mordekaiser
[4:17:31] XIII_Member: And that's all the elaboration I'll give
[4:17:38] starsinthevoids: @Chrom_Kitsune valid
[4:17:52] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune based
[4:18:21] chowleyf: !mic
[4:18:45] NapNapoleon: Honestly, you should maybe try to use yorick lethality instead of nasus in those situations

[4:41:25] mcegginton: I've never seen a nautilus be useful in any of my lobbies so I'm biased I guess
[4:41:27] Tadpolelegs: your ult doesnt wake people up
[4:41:31] HoleyShirt1: naut is better support overall over blitz fs but blitz hooks are so fun it doesnt matter, but with bot changes this season its a little hard to bait hook into tower lol
[4:41:39] Tadpolelegs: where the power of Zoe comes in with MF
[4:41:51] AliensSmokeToo: fk up ult

[4:42:29] lener311: and thresh over all
[4:42:46] Pipkin_d_bun: Yuumi > Any support
[4:42:46] mcegginton: For me, it's Rell
[4:42:48] jonbrev: Rell is super fun to play tho
[4:42:55] HoleyShirt1: thresh too hard to learn for smooth brain, want hook enemy champ, no thoughts, only hook

[4:43:24] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune thresh is THE sup
[4:43:26] HoleyShirt1: idk blitz is pretty funny lmao
[4:43:27] XIII_Member: Blitz can't build full AD and do the funni slap
[4:43:32] XIII_Member: Thresh wins
[4:43:35] mcegginton: @Chrom_Kitsune If thresh counts as a hook champ so does renata and in that case I'm picking her
[4:43:36] HoleyShirt1: especially when he fails and gets clapped LUL
[4:43:37] jonbrev: You're forgetting kled.
[4:43:43] CHAT_SHIDDER: blitz can go full AP and do the funni slap

[4:43:51] jonbrev: Imagine a kled supp HA
[4:43:53] Pipkin_d_bun: Idk I consider skarner as ahook champ
[4:43:57] lener311: its so annoying

[4:44:02] lener311: like lilia
[4:44:05] Pipkin_d_bun: Kled sup is hard, lee sin sup is fun though
[4:44:20] lener311: @Pipkin_d_bun lord have mercy
[4:44:31] mcegginton: What happened to thresh btw he kind of disappeared into obscurity now that renata exists
[4:44:32] XIII_Member: Full AD, Slap, Full AP, OOGA BOOGA, ME HIT HOOK

[4:53:34] Pipkin_d_bun: @lener311 I'm so use to playing ap mf that i forget  how strong ad mf is
[4:53:46] jonbrev: Do those orange flame things on the ground grant permanent stats?
[4:53:46] XIII_Member: @NapNapoleon (In game)
[4:54:01] XIII_Member: Tho, it would be 24/1 in my case
[4:54:01] Pipkin_d_bun: @jonbrev as long as you dont die, yes.

[4:54:36] XIII_Member: The Zoe is just like me playing Zoe frfr
[4:54:39] madeofbatz: madeofbatz subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! hope you and your doggos are thriving. any words for an artist during these mass layoffs? :'c
[4:55:02] XIII_Member: I still don't know how I have M5 on Zoe and M3 on Gwen, a champ I've played WAY more
[4:55:18] lener311: Gwen sup when?
[4:55:20] HoleyShirt1: @Chrom_Kitsune top island
[4:55:30] XIII_Member: I play Gwemid
[4:55:45] HoleyShirt1: asmongold, the guy who cant clean his room? LUL
[4:55:56] HoleyShirt1: we really listening to that guy?
[4:56:14] lener311: we agreed... but no
[4:56:18] madeofbatz: the reason people dont care is because they set a terrible example..
[4:56:18] HoleyShirt1: this is true sadly
[4:56:32] HoleyShirt1: but i wont play activision/blizzard games in my own time for that reason
[4:56:46] madeofbatz: otherwise non profit orgs and boycotts and things like that would not exist and outshine for profit
[4:56:48] XIII_Member: Am I a bad person if my reaction to the layoffs was "Oh no! Anyway."?
[4:56:49] lener311: the frog is spitting facts
[4:57:07] vsmilotic: IONIA fall Kappa
[4:57:13] Best_Vimby: @HoleyShirt1 I mean with how many people they let go, their games won't exist for much longer anyways
[4:57:20] XIII_Member: Who am I kidding? I am a bad person regardless Kappa
[4:57:30] lener311: whats ur fave region?
[4:57:38] HoleyShirt1: its every persons responsibility to have ethics and try to help others, some people are not human or even thinking most of the time, literally just id for some people
[4:57:39] madeofbatz: @Chrom_Kitsune don't expect any sympathy if it happens to you i'd say
[4:57:47] HoleyShirt1: @Best_Vimby hopefully lmao
[4:57:49] XIII_Member: Yeah, I guess so
[4:58:09] XIII_Member: @madeofbatz As long as they get their leave at least and good support
[4:58:23] NapNapoleon: I mean, AI to me looks like the next step. It'll require to maybe acquire new skills AS AN ARTIST.
[4:58:27] joedaluss: AI will never replace a tattoo artist
[4:58:31] anascorpion7: Ggwp
[4:58:32] sleepeatea: SO TRUE GOAT
[4:58:33] joedaluss: So theres that
[4:58:38] AugustUwU: like being a jhin streamer
[4:58:40] lener311: i dunno what's happening in this game... but gg
[4:58:40] NotTheCulprit: theres really cool stuff you can do with AI, but the people pushing for it are all NFT types so it always sounds shady
[4:58:43] sablooms: bars
[4:58:47] Dacnomaniak: I am back bejj borpaLickR
[4:58:52] sleepeatea: As an Artist, AI is fuckin stupid
[4:58:55] Best_Vimby: @Chrom_Kitsune It sucks but with the reputation they have, I can't blame you nor really call you a bad person cause not all of those let go were bad people
[4:58:58] jonbrev: AI can't replace zoe supports tho
[4:58:59] NoooToxicity: ikeepitHYPERBOI
[4:59:00] HoleyShirt1: ai is a tool and thats all it really should be, but eventually it will outpace bc technology cant really be held back like that for long
[4:59:01] cogstopper: how is the zoe support game the game that was the least worst today hinaboPausechamp
[4:59:13] sleepeatea: you're not an artist if you can put words into a prompter and get images created *for* you
[4:59:18] Best_Vimby: @Best_Vimby But there were plenty that likely still were
[4:59:23] NapNapoleon: Oh god.
[4:59:24] Dacnomaniak: DEMONS
[4:59:24] lener311: woaaha

[4:59:40] xstasylordd: ggeeezzz
[4:59:44] Chillabreh: what backups do you have @IKeepItTaco
[4:59:45] Vaquita_Vibes: if theres is one thing AI can do well, its AI covers with cartoon characters like spongbob or biden and the gang
[4:59:55] madeofbatz: nowadays everyone needs a backup.. if youre fully invested in one thing youre doomed..
[4:59:56] Vaquita_Vibes: its so funny
[5:00:01] HoleyShirt1: @Vaquita_Vibes the most chad use of it rn
[5:00:06] acfung: gg taco <3 that was fun, don't ban my hwei pls :0
[5:00:16] madeofbatz: need to have your hands in all kindsa pots.. or however that saying goes LOL
[5:00:17] sleepeatea: @Vaquita_Vibes it's funny but it still uses stolen art to make said images which is not very pog : (
[5:00:20] lener311: @acfung ikeepitRAREHANDS
[5:00:37] cideztv: AI streamers?
[5:00:37] Vaquita_Vibes: @sleepeatea no, its stolen voices
[5:00:47] sleepeatea: OH you're talking about the videos on youtube?
[5:00:48] Vaquita_Vibes: biden and the gang will never do the stuff ai will make them do
[5:00:57] flesh_pedestrian_: YES thank you
[5:01:02] HoleyShirt1: until the ai decides it doesnt want to work at mcdonalds anymore
[5:01:03] sleepeatea: yeah ok those are hilarious. I do love the presidents playing league
[5:01:10] acfung: LOL
[5:01:18] Vaquita_Vibes: @sleepeatea good shit
[5:01:19] madeofbatz: yeah idk how they thought ai needed to replace culture and art instead of dangerous and hard  labor
[5:01:20] sleepeatea: but I'm still not thrilled about the stolen aspect
[5:01:21] kaylafair: ai is just not good
[5:01:22] acfung: DAMN
[5:01:23] vsmilotic: bias Kappa
[5:01:26] acfung: I WILL REMEMBER THAT :)
[5:01:31] cideztv: hey its cidez dont ban hwei :3
[5:01:33] LittleTooDry: big macs are like 16 dollars because low IQers need 20$ an hour to microwave burgers
[5:01:38] HoleyShirt1: idk why but listening to the prezs rate fish tank fish was so funny
[5:01:44] acfung: thats me!
[5:01:55] acfung: xer or zoe?
[5:01:57] madeofbatz: @sleepeatea it would be ok if a artist used ai with their own works only for themselves but other than that... yeah asolutely no
[5:02:01] LittleTooDry: they are the real selfish ones
[5:02:05] acfung: yo i was legit half trolling picking Zoe but then i realized it was u
[5:02:09] acfung: so i was like lets win
[5:02:09] sleepeatea: yeah fr @madeofbatz

[5:02:32] kingrichardddddd: these days
[5:02:36] kingrichardddddd: i read something about that
[5:02:37] Best_Vimby: AI in the current definition of it is not good.
[5:02:39] Vaquita_Vibes: The guy who made the spongbob song with ai voice is so fun
[5:02:43] cogstopper: AI is a tool, how good it is depends on how it's used
[5:02:45] xstasylordd: woahh that was @acfung the zoe in the chat!
[5:03:03] XIII_Member: Hey guys I'm back, did I miss anything? Any controversies that surge and go away almost instantly?
[5:03:04] Hoytastic: @kingrichardddddd OpenAI changed their TOS part that forbid military applications of their technology
[5:03:04] sleepeatea: like I thought AI was supposed to take over all the mundane tasks in our lives so we would have more time to persue the arts and fun stuff; not the other way around NotLikeThis
[5:03:08] acfung: <3 @xstasylordd
[5:03:24] kingrichardddddd: @Hoytastic i mean theyve been using it in a number of conflicts happening rn
[5:03:29] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry i think it's mostly the low iqers who sit in the office and decide where the next mcdonalds will be built and have the day off after 12pm but okay
[5:03:34] orvirith: yuumi mid when?
[5:03:36] cideztv: JHID
[5:03:36] tunabeard: They said the same thing about using robotics in manufacturing, that it would make everyone's lives easier, when all it did was increase shareholder dividends and the workers got laid off
[5:03:38] NotTheCulprit: its cheaper to automate stuff on a computer than to automate cleaning a toilet
[5:03:41] sleepeatea: SO TRUE @madeofbatz
[5:03:43] GravielLastChild: I taco, i have a question sorry to ask this, but I'm trying to main jhin, and doesn't matter what I do i always get a b or a c in the end, i know I'm not that good but my support almost always makes s and s+ with the plays i ask help him to do, is there anything specific of the adc role for me final note?
[5:03:47] Vaquita_Vibes: the moment the suits realized they can use ai for most tasks when its developed enough and still charge full price for goods is gonna be so rough
[5:03:49] Best_Vimby: Wait. Are the background Jhins animated? Has that always been the case???
[5:03:55] XIII_Member: Play Jhizz (Jhin main playing Fizz mid)
[5:04:15] XIII_Member: @Best_Vimby I never noticed until you said it
[5:04:17] jonbrev: It has some benefits in medical fields, like radiology majorly as a confirmatory diagnostic tool. So it wouldn't replace doctors, but help in a way ig
[5:04:20] madeofbatz: @sleepeatea i wish i didnt have to wash the dishes and do laundry anymore but thank god i can listen to a poem generated by a chatbot
[5:04:23] kingrichardddddd: soudns like communism >.>
[5:04:31] lener311: the sup is talking " can I have 3 winning lanes"

[5:04:49] lener311: a hell no
[5:04:50] kingrichardddddd: no greed? end world hunger? sounds like socialism >.>
[5:05:00] Best_Vimby: @Chrom_Kitsune I thought I was seeing things at first now I have to wonder how long they have been
[5:05:04] NotTheCulprit: Fully Automated Luxury Communism
[5:05:04] XIII_Member: That sounds like people with money care
[5:05:09] majoralexlol: Taco the Wise has spoken
[5:05:15] EclipseStriker: corki
[5:05:17] LittleTooDry: not contributing to society, only caring about your "hobbies" and expecting others to pay for your selfish lifestyle
[5:05:17] Best_Vimby: MF mid?
[5:05:19] XIII_Member: And no Fizz so no Jhizz
[5:05:21] madeofbatz: Ai could calculate how much food would need to be distributed in stores or kitchens but NOOO
[5:05:22] sleepeatea: Literally anyone: Hey we should let people have a living wage and room for fun  Always some 20IQ guy: SOUNDS LIKE SOCIALISM TO ME.
[5:05:22] lener311: socialism so based. I enjoy that system in germany
[5:05:35] sleepeatea: Socialism is based af
[5:05:39] Hoytastic: @LittleTooDry bait used to be believable

[5:06:05] kingrichardddddd: @IKeepItTaco thoughts on hubris on jhin?
[5:06:30] XIII_Member: TACO, are you good on Katarina? Now I have that question in my head
[5:06:31] LittleTooDry: only malcontents actually believe in communism/socialism
[5:06:33] antythesis: @lener311 national socialism and socialism are not the same thing, your ignorance is showing
[5:06:35] sleepeatea: i don't mind high taxes and shit if I know everyone is getting enough food, housing, health care etc to live a comfortable life with the skills they have
[5:06:38] vsmilotic: tobias vs tobias Kappa
[5:06:41] LittleTooDry: jealous of other peoples' successes

[5:07:38] khangnile: wow just tuned in

[5:08:32] LittleTooDry: @sleepeatea your worth is the rarity of profitable talents. if everyone is an ArTisT then you don't deserve money due to oversaturation
[5:08:33] Vaquita_Vibes: dropping
[5:08:33] flesh_pedestrian_: ikeepitLETSGO
[5:08:46] XIII_Member: Cogstoper is the Hero we needed but didn't deserve
[5:08:51] LittleTooDry: are these viewers 12 years old? how are so many of you so dense
[5:09:23] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry not everyone wants to be an artist yknow, but sure if youd rather slave away your life than actually enjoy it, go do that.
[5:09:27] sleepeatea: @LittleTooDry that's a sad way to look at your fellow people.  Not everyone has the early life supports and opportunities to become lawyers and doctors. We all make do with what we can.  It doesn't mean we don't all deserve to live a comfortable life
[5:09:29] XIII_Member: @LittleTooDry Depends on the skills of the artist and the style. Not every artist is in the same level
[5:09:40] skitter_bb: ah, bringing out the ol' TwIVsted Fate?
[5:10:01] lener311: @sleepeatea "dO iT uR OwN"
[5:10:10] LittleTooDry: @madeofbatz making a good living to support yourself and your family is not being a wage slave. sorry you've been lied to by reddit
[5:10:17] sleepeatea: @lener311 brb pulling myself up by my bootstraps ResidentSleeper
[5:10:34] XIII_Member: MODS, pin this mf down, and twist his nuts counter-clockwise
[5:10:44] XIII_Member: Pretty please
[5:11:01] diefect: why red?)
[5:11:05] LittleTooDry: @sleepeatea you can literally become a millionaire as a plumber.  get into trades, start your business, bust your ass, then retire rich
[5:11:06] Best_Vimby: Nope
[5:11:11] cogstopper: Did you call yourself Tofungus Foot
[5:11:13] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz i am not on reddit, it seems like you are familiar tho. kinda weird to accuse me of that
[5:11:20] XIII_Member: Okay DOPA
[5:11:22] vsmilotic: tobito long lost cousin? Kappa
[5:11:26] LittleTooDry: everyone has been lied to that you need to be a doctor/lawyer to be rich
[5:11:38] LittleTooDry: when all it really takes is effort
[5:11:40] XIII_Member: Okay then
[5:11:42] XIII_Member: Be rich
[5:11:51] sleepeatea: @LittleTooDry not everyone has the opportunities, the physical ability or general ability to go into the trades. The people that can't still deserve to live a comfortable life with what they *can* do
[5:11:51] lener311: @sleepeatea xddd socioeconomic background fucked so many people
[5:11:53] sabaton_rico: @LittleTooDry you just need to be a streamer, YES
[5:12:12] madeofbatz: why is this guy talking to us promoting capitalist ideals as if we're not living in the same world which sucks ass lol
[5:12:28] LittleTooDry: you all are purposely missing the point I'm making
[5:12:28] Macklez_: !rank
[5:12:29] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[5:12:34] LittleTooDry: scream into the void all you want, I'm right
[5:12:45] sleepeatea: like just because some people were rased in poverty and didn't get the opportunities to go to post secondary, go into the trades or get a high paying job, doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to make enough money to live
[5:12:51] lener311: capitalism kills ikeepitANGERYBOI
[5:12:53] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry we know you're right.. very towards the right LOL
[5:13:01] XIII_Member: What I love the most about these types of discussions is the fact that the one trying to tell how to win in the capitalism are as poor as me
[5:13:07] Pullks: 19 raiders from Pullks have joined! 
[5:13:13] Pullks: hello mr taco
[5:13:25] LittleTooDry: @madeofbatz so because I'm saying you can make a living by actually working hard in something makes me right wing? kinda outting yourself, no?
[5:13:27] sleepeatea: if the best someone can do is work retail their whole lives, they should still be able to live off those wages
[5:13:42] sleepeatea: @madeofbatz lmaoooo so true
[5:13:45] LittleTooDry: how am I wrong then
[5:13:58] LittleTooDry: everyone is calling me capitalist slave
[5:14:07] Pullks: thanks for the SO :3
[5:14:09] geomancerxiv: remember, anything you need to do or want in life is ALWAYS in the cards, just gotta dig deep into that card pile and you'll get to it :D --TF probably
[5:14:12] sleepeatea: lmao So true Taco
[5:14:12] mehulsharma27: hellooo tacooo
[5:14:13] Pullks: How has ranked been
[5:14:15] LittleTooDry: but no actual rebuttal4
[5:14:19] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz it's funny how you think we don't work hard and thats why we don't want to work LOL
[5:14:40] lener311: political discussion with taco and viewers when? xddd
[5:15:22] XIII_Member: Okay, @LittleTooDry , how do you start investing without an initial capital? Even more, if you say this is how you can "win" capitalism, then do it, if it's so simple. You are in the same situation as us, no money, and hold on to the lie you've been fed up your whole life. Work like an ass for like 30 years to rest? No thanks.
[5:15:24] LittleTooDry: taco that's exactly my point
[5:15:24] sleepeatea: @LittleTooDry regular people these days need to work multiple jobs to even hope to live a comfortable life.  That's fucked up.  They're working extremely hard and barely have room to breathe and yet they're still bordering on poverty.  It's messed up.  Working harder than everyone else doesn't mean you make more money
[5:15:29] lener311: @adam_juz I recommend Engels and marx
[5:15:32] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry look at the artist mass layoffs from riot and blizzard from this week and tell me these people didnt work hard and put effort in
[5:15:37] lener311: xddd
[5:15:40] majoralexlol: Supply and demand, everbody poops
[5:15:44] Vaquita_Vibes: south park knows
[5:15:45] sleepeatea: People should be able to pursue their passions and do what makes them happy in life
[5:15:52] LittleTooDry: you don't have to be "rich", you should strive to be comfortable
[5:15:52] lener311: only rich people enjoy capitalism
[5:16:09] LittleTooDry: socialism is only stealing from your neighbor
[5:16:10] sleepeatea: @lener311 thirded
[5:16:19] LittleTooDry: name a country where socialism has ever worked
[5:16:21] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry we cannot be comfortable in this system LUL
[5:16:22] sleepeatea: Socialism is actually Helping your neighbours but good try !!
[5:16:27] LittleTooDry: please
[5:16:27] XIII_Member: But anyway, that's how I finish my take on the topic, since I'm just repeating myself at this pont, and that's just insanity
[5:16:30] LittleTooDry: compare NK and SK
[5:16:46] Vaquita_Vibes: well socialism has never been implementee properly, its just a dictaroship claiming to be for the people
[5:16:47] majoralexlol: People who say socialism don't know what a normal country is like.
[5:16:49] LittleTooDry: socialism/communism it's all losers lmao
[5:16:53] lener311: @adam_juz i dont understand... what does it mean ikeepitRAREHANDS

[5:17:16] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry funny for you to say youre the biggest loser here
[5:17:16] LittleTooDry: because it's so great?
[5:17:19] antythesis: capitalism pays off big for the few on top and so all they have to do is spend enough money on convincing us normal folk that its the end goal
[5:17:24] ageofhaIcyon: bro where are you getting this fucking ideas from jfc
[5:17:41] vsmilotic: what the hell are we talking about in league stream LUL
[5:17:44] XIII_Member: We need a new system fr, none of the ones that are here currently work
[5:17:50] sleepeatea: pure socialism doesn't work because there will always be people who take advantage of it but socialism is a much better idea than capitalism
[5:17:56] XIII_Member: Because it's part of human nature to find exploits
[5:18:01] Yasukeh: that CS would be fine if lilia didn't Q it RAGEY
[5:18:07] Anvenjade: Funny you're listening to Hades OST, I'm trying to clear 32 heat on all weapons rn
[5:18:07] sleepeatea: Capitalism is proven to not work as we can see with the current economy
[5:18:11] lener311: a <3 for the frog
[5:18:12] BasedEGOR: plumbing makes a lot of money because people always be shiddin
[5:18:13] mch2025: why twisted fate?
[5:18:15] LittleTooDry: capitalism is the greatest form of economics ever created. perfect? no, but it is undeniable that cap has raised more people out of poverty than any other system
[5:18:18] mch2025: that’s a rare pick
[5:18:26] sleepeatea: @LittleTooDry LOL it's sad you actually believe this
[5:18:30] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry me when i'm wrong and deluded
[5:18:31] LittleTooDry: and you have brainworms if you just refuse the proof
[5:18:31] lener311: @mch2025 u missed the nausu adc
[5:18:32] vsmilotic: i need brainless league streamer where is tobito BrokeBack this is too serious for me
[5:18:33] Vaquita_Vibes: why does people think socialsm = dictato? places that claim communism or socialsm are bascially psuedo king class over the people, not true implementation of socialsm
[5:18:33] sleepeatea: Capitalism only benefits the 1%
[5:18:35] valo_ren: @mch2025 buffs
[5:18:37] boosted509: in a twitch stream.. we are all kids
[5:18:45] LittleTooDry: @sleepeatea that is such a baseless lie
[5:18:50] XIII_Member: We should go back to exchanging goods and services with other goods and services, no money, just trade
[5:18:53] CookieMonsterForEver: @sleepeatea well as Taco is saying. Nothing would work perfectly since there are people who end up abusing it.
[5:18:57] valo_ren: Can we not argue politics in a twitch stream and enjoy some league please :'D
[5:19:04] XIII_Member: Like the indigenous people intended
[5:19:06] Sakyn: Why are we talking about politics
[5:19:09] sleepeatea: Capitalism is why the reason why the economy sucks and no one can afford to live right now
[5:19:12] lener311: @valo_ren NO!!!
[5:19:15] sleepeatea: capitalism is laughably terrible
[5:19:19] XIII_Member: @valo_ren We were talking about 9/11 20 minutes ago
[5:19:23] Yasukeh: the auto reset on W looks so nice
[5:19:30] madeofbatz: capitalism is perfect! some 1% own all the money in the world and the rift between them and poverty is solving the worlds entire problems with their money! YAY
[5:19:30] LittleTooDry: yes
[5:19:35] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune corkiiiii ikeepitANGERYBOI
[5:19:36] LittleTooDry: name an innovation under communism
[5:19:41] LittleTooDry: name one under socialism
[5:19:54] Vaquita_Vibes: inovation via competion is a good thing
[5:20:12] sleepeatea: innovation is great until no one can afford it and your entire population is living on breadcrumbs
[5:20:18] Vaquita_Vibes: the space probe under the party was pretty interesting
[5:20:21] majoralexlol: Industrialism was in the cradle back then
[5:20:26] LittleTooDry: the founders also expected the gov to be small and remain small and only govern a polite society
[5:20:26] valo_ren: So capitalism would be fine if we regulated it and kept nearly everyone on a level playing field? @IKeepItTaco
[5:20:30] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry you think peopele dont invent stuff when they dont have money as a motivation? have you ever enjoyed smth?
[5:20:36] sleepeatea: very few people are benefitting these days because everything is so expensive and no one can afford to live
[5:20:37] valo_ren: I'll join in, since everyone wants to argue LOL
[5:20:40] Vaquita_Vibes: lol, good health care
[5:20:42] XIII_Member: Fuck all of this -isms, let's go back to truke
[5:20:43] Vaquita_Vibes: imagine
[5:20:50] XIII_Member: trueke*
[5:20:52] Soupman456: i think we should nuke ourselves
[5:21:01] Yasukeh: There's a concept of looking at the outcomes of a system and viewing that as the intention. If the outcome of a system is X, then the intention was X. Follow actions, not words.
[5:21:02] XIII_Member: In game of course
[5:21:07] LittleTooDry: can you define the "1%"
[5:21:08] Hoytastic: Modern medicines are developed in government-funded universities! Capitalism does not invent medicines!
[5:21:13] The_Dumest_Moron: return to bartering, no more inflation Kappa
[5:21:14] jonbrev: Our healthcare is dogcrap majorly thanks to insurance
[5:21:18] valo_ren: Agreed for the most part. People like Musk and Bezos have no need for that much money. They could instead put that money towards the good of humanity, or at least the US
[5:21:29] sleepeatea: no one needs 1 Billion dollars fr
[5:21:38] valo_ren: A good sona? Really? It's so rare :'D
[5:21:39] Yasukeh: For example, the school system isn't broken, it's working exactly as intended. The state of students capabilities coming out of school is the intended outcome.
[5:21:44] Yasukeh: Hello broadcaster yasukeh5Chad
[5:21:46] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry can you? bc if you can't you're simply out of touch with reality omg
[5:21:51] LittleTooDry: @valo_ren interesting you want to spend other peoples' money
[5:22:02] Jokisilent: not even close
[5:22:06] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune do u think nun are also into war crimes?
[5:22:09] Jokisilent: damn not the jhin ban
[5:22:18] LittleTooDry: @madeofbatz I don't need to, I'm not the one making baseless claims about the "1%"
[5:22:18] lener311: nunu
[5:22:18] 2KayDee: Hey Taco, some interesting topics today ikeepitLETTER
[5:22:21] valo_ren: @LittleTooDry Bro- it's not about me- I'm not saying it should benefit me. I'm saying it should go towards bettering everyone-
[5:22:24] XIII_Member: There should be a rule when you hit 1 billion: a little letter that says "Congrats! You won capitalism! :D" and you can't exceed the billion mark, all your earnings go to people in need
[5:22:26] sleepeatea: bros could solve world hunger or the homeless crisis but instead they want to buy twitter and throw stones from their palace
[5:22:27] khangnile: lots of fighting words in chat today
[5:22:32] XIII_Member: @lener311 Aye
[5:22:38] ImBeefus: @sleepeatea Free will
[5:22:38] Hoytastic: @LittleTooDry what action do stock holders engage in to earn the dividends of the companies they are invested in
[5:22:43] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz LMFAOOOOOOOO WHAT you are actually delusional.. baseless claims LOL
[5:22:54] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune more as an active or passive part?
[5:22:55] ImBeefus: Its their money they should be allowed to do what they want  with it thats one perspective
[5:23:06] sleepeatea: free will is great and should stay in tact but I'm just saying noone needs 1 billion dollars
[5:23:07] ImBeefus: The other would be forced to donate it back
[5:23:12] mch2025: wait ashe is meta?
[5:23:13] ImBeefus: Nah 1 bil is brazy
[5:23:15] mch2025: nice
[5:23:17] XIII_Member: @lener311 Well, they do love Jesus, a man who died by a death given only to war criminals
[5:23:18] LittleTooDry: @valo_ren musk does donate. he created starlink which helped provide ukrainian citizens with internet when everything went down
[5:23:19] valo_ren: @ImBeefus Agreed. But 1 billion...bit ecessive no?
[5:23:19] XIII_Member: I rest my case
[5:23:23] vsmilotic: LUL TF is meta? LUL
[5:23:23] Yasukeh: some clean TF play
[5:23:29] ImBeefus: @valo_ren Yeah  but what if they earned it
[5:23:31] LittleTooDry: not every billionaire is a "dr evil"
[5:23:33] lener311: @ImBeefus free will is a meme. Were all determined
[5:23:35] madeofbatz: @ImBeefus except it's not possibel to amass this much money by not exploiting people so thats stealing other peoples money too
[5:23:39] InkyBabaYaga: TF adc try????
[5:23:40] sabaton_rico: how does the health system in the US looks like? here in germany you dont need to think about to pay the bill of your healthcare.
[5:23:47] sleepeatea: like after 1 billion, I feel like your money should go to helping people in not as privileged situations
[5:23:48] geomancerxiv: as a participant in Capitalism, I came to twitch to watch Taco smash heads in LoL, not to read a flame war on politics, that's for reddit. :(
[5:23:50] ImBeefus: @madeofbatz I'd disagree thats not really a fact
[5:23:54] Hoytastic: Everyone here who believes in socialism needs to read marx yall are just vibing. get serious
[5:23:55] ageofhaIcyon: @sabaton_rico pay or get fucked over
[5:23:59] XIII_Member: @lener311 Free will is a myth, religion is a joke, we are all controlled by someone much greater
[5:24:05] XIII_Member: MEMES, THE DNA OF THE SOUL
[5:24:05] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry then tell me how legitamately theyve accumulated their money
[5:24:10] LittleTooDry: if you create a product that benefits society and people want it then you deserve to be wealthy from it
[5:24:10] Yune4Capura: bro what’s going on with chat today??
[5:24:12] valo_ren: @LittleTooDry And what's his continued net worth? Imagine if we leveled the playing field to where no one's Individual net worth was around 5 million. America would be livable again
[5:24:14] mch2025: can’t you play ashe aggro and pole hard?
[5:24:18] sleepeatea: @Yune4Capura we are angry today
[5:24:20] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz it is. do research
[5:24:25] mch2025: poke
[5:24:28] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune agnostic?
[5:24:30] jonbrev: Despite research and development of pharmaceuticals, the application of those drugs in terms of prescription are heavily dependent on insurance, as they basically control hospitals nowadays
[5:24:35] valo_ren: @valo_ren Majority over minority is how you run a country
[5:24:35] cogstopper: bro what's with the redditor meetup today hinaboPausechamp
[5:24:39] Yune4Capura: @sleepeatea i see that damn
[5:24:40] Yasukeh: My healthcare involves consuming dubiously legal compounds and going to mexico to get things for pennies yasukeh5Chad
[5:24:43] NotTheCulprit: @LittleTooDry like insulin for example
[5:24:46] XIII_Member: @lener311 No, memes, the DNA of the soul
[5:24:49] Yasukeh: Medical tourism?
[5:24:50] sabaton_rico: @ageofhaIcyon so there is no system behind it? if you want something you need to pay it completly yourself?
[5:24:52] jonbrev: Insurance companies can legally dictate hospital policies. Crasy
[5:24:57] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune agree
[5:24:57] ImBeefus: Its funny how when you ask for a fact people say " do research"
[5:25:03] ImBeefus: Why would I research something you said lol
[5:25:05] santyyy420: And Russia
[5:25:06] LittleTooDry: @valo_ren equity is a dangerous game
[5:25:07] ImBeefus: If you said it back it up
[5:25:14] Hoytastic: Canada and Germany both have better health outcomes spending half the amount of GOVERNMENT money
[5:25:15] geomancerxiv: @IKeepItTaco Do you play Sivir? I know you love Jhin, just curious :)
[5:25:17] lener311: good and funny chat today
[5:25:18] madeofbatz: @ImBeefus bc this a fucking gaming stream and you asked
[5:25:22] LittleTooDry: @valo_ren why does everyone need 5m? what did they do to deserve it?
[5:25:22] valo_ren: @sabaton_rico Insurance only covers so much, no insurace, and you'll be paying cause ur alive, until ur dead again LMAO
[5:25:24] XIII_Member: TF gameplay & chill with League in the background
[5:25:32] Yasukeh: My mom was on 12 diff medications and I saw that half of them weren't needed at all. Had her bring this up to her doctor and he agreed they weren't needed despite having prescribed them.
[5:25:33] XIII_Member: Chill with money talk
[5:25:35] flesh_pedestrian_: This jhin has the money skin
[5:25:36] ImBeefus: @madeofbatz Exactly and you're talking politics online with no facts in a twitch chat, its cringe..
[5:25:51] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune like the rich 😎
[5:25:55] jonbrev: A key emerging concept in healthcare is preventive medicine. Countries like Canada and Germany have better policies
[5:26:03] XIII_Member: I'm cringe, therefore, I am free
[5:26:04] ImBeefus: Can we just enjoy the game and not talk politics
[5:26:07] valo_ren: @LittleTooDry Clearly you can't read LMAO. I said limit the amount. I didn't say everyone gets 5 mill. I'm saying 5 mill is enough for anyone to live off of. You don't really need more
[5:26:11] ImBeefus: No one here knows what they're talking about LOL
[5:26:11] XIII_Member: I am pure of heart, dumb of ass
[5:26:13] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz then why do you care? you want me to calculate it in here`at 5 am?
[5:26:14] Hoytastic: Insurance makes money every time they say no
[5:26:19] Hoytastic: they are incentivized to say no
[5:26:30] Yasukeh: It's really common in Arizona to go to mexico for many medical procedures. You get the same quality for significantly cheaper. Really common in dental work especially.
[5:26:58] sabaton_rico: @valo_ren well. in germany EVERYONE has a insurance. it get paid automatical. medicine is sometimes free, sometimes cheap
[5:27:04] LittleTooDry: @valo_ren according to whom? you? what's your qualifications to determine how much someone should be allowed to have?
[5:27:07] XIII_Member: Here in Dominican Republic is just that, but turned up to 11
[5:27:08] jonbrev: Thankfully, public hospitals and its doctors can cheat their way through insurance companies more easily than privatel-funded hospitals
[5:27:08] ImBeefus: @valo_ren What happens when you give someone 5 mil and they become broke again? Do they deserve more money or to be broke
[5:27:14] valo_ren: @sabaton_rico That's why im moving out of this semi-fucked country LMAO
[5:27:17] Hoytastic: Every dollar of profit for an insurance company is a dollar spent on healthcare that didnt go to healthcare
[5:27:20] Yune4Capura: im happy im not American when its comes to health insurance
[5:27:29] sleepeatea: I understand why people need to make money from healthy care but it just feels so shitty to deny someone their *health* because they're poor
[5:27:29] lener311: 4:44 am in germay
[5:27:36] lener311: leeeeeets go
[5:27:37] sleepeatea: I don't have a solution for it but honestly health care should be a right
[5:27:40] XIII_Member: I would be happy to not be in the US if I got it better
[5:27:44] LittleTooDry: @Yune4Capura would you rather be canadian where instead of helping they just kill you?
[5:27:45] sleepeatea: not something you have to worry about whether or not you can afford
[5:27:49] madeofbatz: @valo_ren you do realize that millions and billions are very vast differences
[5:27:49] XIII_Member: But I really notice I got it worse LUL
[5:27:50] sabaton_rico: 4:44 AM in Germasny. LETS GO
[5:28:14] XIII_Member: 5:45
[5:28:15] sleepeatea: @LittleTooDry I'm Canadian and yes I MUCH prefer our health care over the US health care
[5:28:18] XIII_Member: 4:45*
[5:28:22] Yune4Capura: @littletoodry why Canadian? i just said im happy to live in a country with great health care
[5:28:31] sleepeatea: ours isn't perfect but it's vastly superior to the shit in the US
[5:28:34] LittleTooDry: also health insurance in USA would be cheaper if people didn't eat oreos by the sleeve and sit on their ass all day
[5:28:39] LittleTooDry: we all didn't use to be his fat btw
[5:28:44] TheMysticalWaffle: taking a break from jhin?
[5:28:45] LittleTooDry: this*
[5:28:53] XIII_Member: Dominican Republic's Healthcare is US's Healthcare, but somehow they made it worse

[5:29:57] sleepeatea: @Hoytastic true
[5:30:01] LittleTooDry: how is anything I'm saying bait
[5:30:03] madeofbatz: @LittleTooDry mayb bc theres no health regulations that check food ingredients. you guys have shit in your food that isnt even allowed in europe
[5:30:05] sleepeatea: but sometimes you just gotta be angry
[5:30:09] XIII_Member: @sabaton_rico More expensive, worse quality, and if you don't have insurance, well, the funeral is cheaper
[5:30:11] mehulsharma27: i have chickenpox KEKL
[5:30:20] LittleTooDry: @madeofbatz allow me to introduce you to the FDA
[5:30:46] XIII_Member: Hey, I heard your economic system is strong, let me fight it!
[5:30:48] Yune4Capura: anyway, how are the games going today?
[5:30:50] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz the fda usa and germany are vastly different but i dont expect you to understand
[5:30:53] Hoytastic: trumps FDA sold off its ability to regulate pork to the people who grow the pork lmao
[5:30:58] Hoytastic: you think thats a good system dawg
[5:31:13] lener311: @madeofbatz its a difference like day and night xd
[5:31:17] LittleTooDry: @madeofbatz missing the point. idc about differences between other countries. you say there's no regulations when there are
[5:31:26] XIII_Member: Who wins? The Capitalism or Goku?
[5:31:38] Femistix: Cheer100
[5:31:44] geomancerxiv: the amount of down-talking is insane.
[5:31:49] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz i think youre missing the point when the regulation is fucking shit.
[5:32:00] Untitlelied: are you gaming son?
[5:32:08] Hoytastic: Boeing fired like half its QA department when it merged with a failed plane company that somehow all of the fail C suite took over Boeing
[5:32:10] XIII_Member: Yeah, after I saw how dense was Dry, I just stopped taking this whole topic seriously LUL
[5:32:11] LittleTooDry: @madeofbatz shit regulation is still regulation xD
[5:32:30] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune ichigo for sure

[5:34:15] madeofbatz: anyways, on a positive note, i love art and creative freedom to express it and i wish people would just draw something for once and enjoy themselves, not be so bitter all the time
[5:34:20] XIII_Member: He really is almost as bs as Goku
[5:34:26] XIII_Member: Probably more LUL
[5:34:28] lener311: @Chrom_Kitsune more then shadow?
[5:34:28] narwhegian: tf sounds so funny when he deadge😭
[5:34:29] sabaton_rico: i really cant believe, that such a wealthy nation like the US dont have a common, or general insurance system where everyone pays in automatical and profit from it. is it that complicated? i am ill since last year march bec of a nerve problem in my hand. insurance pays .. i think it was 70% of my paycheck and all of the needed medical investigation, therapy and the operation yesterday. didnt pay a penny beside the automatical system. i think in the US i would have no money now if i hear it ^^
[5:34:38] XIII_Member: @lener311 Right now, after Frontiers?

[5:35:12] sleepeatea: @madeofbatz same.  I'm very lucky that I can pursue my passion which is art while also working in a day job that I'm equally passionate about which is in health care.  Everyone should be able to afford to live comfortably regardless what their job is
[5:35:15] madeofbatz: with a comma LOL
[5:35:17] The_Dumest_Moron: @chrom_kitsune shadow gets a gun tho
[5:35:21] sleepeatea: people deserve to live as happy a life as they can
[5:35:44] sabaton_rico: @noTraycyStiftrue i cant. my text was too long so i had to cut it a bit ^^
[5:35:47] XIII_Member: And you know, when Super Sonic beats the living crap out of a 5D God in 06, you really start questioning wtf happened in that franchise
[5:35:59] MissSpicyTaco: what's ghosting?
[5:35:59] noTraycyStiftrue: @sabaton_rico dang what a shame
[5:36:10] sleepeatea: not everyone will be happy working a job that might make a lot of money and they deserve to work something that makes them happy whiel also being able to afford food, a roof and health
[5:36:14] lener311: @sleepeatea every life is equal
[5:36:24] sleepeatea: @lener311 fr!

[5:36:32] XIII_Member: @The_Dumest_Moron As long as Sonic has at least one ring, he'll be fine
[5:36:50] lener311: debate bro energy today
[5:37:16] sleepeatea: @madeofbatz Honestly the only reason I'm able to do both passions is because of a lot of privileges that come from having a fairly well off family that has helped me a lot
[5:37:22] sleepeatea: so I acknowledge I'm very lucky
[5:37:31] XIII_Member: Open debate: Tell me a character and I'll tell you if they can beat Game Sonic. If they can, I'll tell you Archi Sonic bodies them LUL
[5:37:40] XIII_Member: Archie*
[5:37:57] sabaton_rico: @noTraycyStiftrue just wanted to give information. cuz it seems like that there are big differences between the health systems

[5:38:59] madeofbatz: @madeofbatz you're lucky! we were pretty poor, still am, can't even afford life atm and i've worked really hard but bc of mental illness I got sick quickly in bad work environments and overworked myself a lot bc i am afraid of making mistakes
[5:39:24] sleepeatea: mental illness is rough especially in this day and age. it's so debilitating
[5:39:29] lener311: @madeofbatz hugs for u. better times are coming.
[5:39:30] fizzy_fizz00: taco why you walk up :(
[5:39:31] XIII_Member: I can think of 3 characters that can beat Sonic LUL

[5:41:32] XIII_Member: gg
[5:41:37] madeofbatz: @sleepeatea yeah everyone says youre just lazy and dont want to work.. when in most work environments i work my ass off and they walk all over me and i dont get anything out of it anyways
[5:41:38] XIII_Member: This is surely a game of all time
[5:41:55] MissSpicyTaco: thia sona was sick tho
[5:42:10] santyyy420: Cute dogs man
[5:42:27] XIII_Member: Stand proud Sona, you are strong
[5:42:27] sleepeatea: @madeofbatz yeah I always say living with mental illness is like running a marathon with a broken leg that no one can see.  It's so much harder to keep up with everyone and everyone gets mad at you because you don't keep up
[5:42:37] The_Dumest_Moron: why is it that the people off their one trick always flame?
[5:42:46] sleepeatea: they can't see that you're injured and it's just so
[5:42:50] santyyy420: gn taco
