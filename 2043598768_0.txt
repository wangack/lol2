[3:47:14] samuelhuh: @zestyspider its SOO nice

[3:47:23] EllAur: is palworld actually fun? are u guys playing chatters
[3:47:31] LilyMichaelShip_: it looks fun
[3:47:37] jonaslikestrees: yes @EllAur
[3:47:37] cultofaiden: If you like survival games its fun
[3:47:38] pawkinese: it's kinda fun and buggy
[3:47:39] EllAur: @ganja_haze is getting buff! check spideraxe30 on twitter
[3:47:39] AugustUwU: palworld is best game to release since League of Legends
[3:47:43] cultofaiden: but kinda grindy if you aren't used to them
[3:47:44] michealclout14: im having a lot of fun on it

[3:48:07] heinzbitte: @AugustUwU give us some pal champs
[3:48:10] bipolar_bearclaw: Fake August
[3:48:13] kitsunethunder: palword is garbo
[3:48:15] EllAur: how similar is it to ark? like if u didnt enjoy ark could u still enjoy it
[3:48:18] chill_extremist: that game looks like hot dog shit
[3:48:19] lemonjooses: August can I shave your head

[3:48:26] AugustUwU: he's good now
[3:48:26] cultofaiden: Very similar to ark
[3:48:28] dreamingrabbit: Palworld is fun but its literally just pokemons with guns
[3:48:29] trunnpet: @19yruj they're so easy to play against
[3:48:33] 19yruj: cna you nerf senna now pls

[3:48:34] trunnpet: and weak
[3:48:35] ganja_haze: @ganja_haze I saw but how it procs is the problem. Last season you could heal people if you healed or shielded them with the stacks you already had. Since the new season it only procs if the person you heal or shield is in combat. It's so shit.
[3:48:40] jonaslikestrees: i dont get the ark comparison
[3:48:45] kitsunethunder: @PekinWoof if you play Hwei bot, are you playing HweiDC
[3:48:46] Syched: 1 second buff Pog

[3:49:09] NadiaBusiness: SYNDRA?
[3:49:19] ChaoticRyder: wow syndra almost played that really well
[3:49:25] trunnpet: nice assist
[3:49:30] shintoaliengod: pantheon support will carry
[3:49:33] AugustUwU: its better this way, you need to get your score to 4-4-4

[3:49:38] jonaslikestrees: @kitsunethunder sorry you are on the palworld hate train, must suck man :(
[3:49:40] EllAur: @ganja_haze oh wow didnt know that! i dont like that "In combat" change at all
[3:49:47] 19yruj: @trunnpet enchanters are god tier and make everyone immortal, literally broken every game I queue is sona sera soraka janna or senna
[3:49:50] LilyMichaelShip_: hi @soniclettuce SpicyWolf /
[3:49:52] lemonjooses: August when are you going to change ornn passive so I don't have to rely on my teammates building good first items
[3:49:56] LilyMichaelShip_: !hic
[3:49:57] Nightbot: Pekin has had 883 hiccups on stream
[3:50:09] Niviere: 4-4-4 is not enough, we need one more
[3:50:11] jub727: jaksho?
[3:50:11] kitsunethunder: @jonaslikestrees i posted diesofcringe in response to ark egg times and i'm getting flamed for palworld hate

[3:50:40] EllAur: august is the double crit bug still happening or did u guys fix it already
[3:50:42] ganja_haze: @AugustUwU Is helia only supposed to proc if the person being shielded or healed is in combat? Because that's how it is now, and it wasn't that way last season. You could still proc the healing from the shards collected without being in combat
[3:50:49] jhjhjljl: unending despair Kappa
[3:50:50] LilyMichaelShip_: SpicyWolf
[3:50:50] bipbipbopbopog: Yeah man, just do it, im sure you can trust chat

[3:58:26] jhjhjljl: but morgana is better than hwei
[3:58:34] zake1313: Try black cleaver first item into trinity
[3:58:39] ammishpollo: @19yruj if they made morgana look like kayle that would ruin the lore b/c thats exactly what she doesnt want to be

[3:59:53] lemonjooses: On garen
[4:00:13] Albenss: NOTED
[4:00:16] nonexistent_man: notee
[4:00:22] jhjhjljl: is it free
[4:00:36] EllAur: @PekinWoof looking at individual role tier lists is interesting because you see some off meta picks in ther. teemo had 56% WR support last patch
[4:00:36] dinastyxy: it seems like its lichabne
[4:00:37] zake1313: try leagueofitems
[4:00:40] dinastyxy: first item
[4:00:51] cragheart: does this mean youre playing zoe

[4:01:14] LilyMichaelShip_: @dJustOne just go full crit :)
[4:01:14] tense_bagel: sample size matters
[4:01:24] jhjhjljl: this looks so much better than opgg
[4:01:25] dJustOne: @lilymichaelship_ No.
[4:01:26] EllAur: yeah for sure, its fun to try find silly off meta picks though
[4:01:29] LilyMichaelShip_: @dJustOne :)
[4:01:35] 19yruj: @konungr___ most ap champs have good wave clear anyway so no real point
[4:01:36] anivia3000: bird angle
[4:01:36] Sushihorns: this is a twitch game
[4:01:39] LilyMichaelShip_: PEKW
[4:01:41] mivyard: HAHAHA not the gun meta
[4:01:44] LilyMichaelShip_: pokemon guns
[4:01:47] pyroflexin: Enshrouded went the wands route
[4:01:49] frozennyogurt: what a bunch of copycats
[4:01:49] konungr___: @19yruj could be a fun item for ap bruisers
[4:01:49] dJustOne: @lilymichaelship_ :|
[4:01:51] Albenss: hwei is bot I tink
[4:01:51] dinastyxy: palworld not gonna fall off in two months Clueless
[4:02:02] EllAur: lolalytics is amazing. theyre even show you sets of items together and their winrate, btu sample size can be small. they have extrapolated sets too
[4:02:07] LilyMichaelShip_: @dinastyxy 1 month
[4:02:11] opticalbattle: Hextech gunblade dying in the conner
[4:02:15] dJustOne: They will add content
[4:02:22] DarkMauroo: when was the last time you saw a Zilean in Ranked?
[4:02:25] konungr___: @19yruj it would mostly be biuilt on off meta picks lol
[4:02:26] zake1313: Try black cleaver first item into trinity
[4:02:29] 19yruj: @19yruj ap bruisers are strong enough imo I think a hydra item would be too op or just worthless for them
[4:02:29] zake1313: this is op
[4:02:33] crunchvper: Idk palworld seems pretty fun
[4:02:34] dinastyxy: WE FEEEEED
[4:02:35] kitsunethunder: can't wait for two months when I'm the last person left playing Lethal Company Smoge
[4:02:36] Niviere: you made all of its money

[4:02:54] pyroflexin: I'm gonna be ok
[4:02:55] kitsunethunder: Do NOT try this at home guys!!
[4:02:55] 19yruj: @19yruj if mostly for off-meta its too niche to warrant an item tbh
[4:02:59] EllAur: yaaaaay fun
[4:02:59] Niviere: Would you recommend briar top in low elo?
[4:03:01] whoopsie_incident: Was 14.2 actually a nerf to Briar? I feels like it was more of a change or even buff
[4:03:03] Xelcion: They only made 151mil on palworld Keepo
[4:03:08] LilyMichaelShip_: briar top works
[4:03:35] dinastyxy: the breakpoint is 400 hp right?
[4:03:47] zake1313: Try black cleaver first item into trinity
[4:03:56] dinastyxy: I heard it mentioned somewhere
[4:04:00] dJustOne: Hearthsteel first?!
[4:04:01] EllAur: @Niviere as low elo no but depends on how good u are with her. if ur good at her tho then absolutely
[4:04:03] Nightbot: Use !queue for the name of the queue game.
[4:04:07] dinastyxy: Im not sure what the actual number is
[4:04:16] dinastyxy: @dJustOne how to be useless entire game challenge (impossible)
[4:04:19] LilyMichaelShip_: naafiri :D
[4:04:20] DerKerim1: Would you be able to climb challenger with all 5 roles?
[4:04:32] LilyMichaelShip_: probably
[4:04:33] dinastyxy: pekin top xdd
[4:04:34] dJustOne: @dinastyxy he has to do it for content!
[4:04:42] 19yruj: if t1 could do it...
[4:04:50] Niviere: @Niviere fair
[4:04:51] wadderbuffalo: "Pekin challenger is easy"

[4:05:00] DerKerim1: Always watch youtube my first time being on stream

[4:05:24] DerKerim1: @LilyMichaelShip_ Wanting to learn more about the game
[4:05:25] whoopsie_incident: I feel like Naafiri is the next Aphelios in the sense that I feel like nobody actually knows what the champ does PEKW
[4:05:26] quexinn: Omg the briaring
[4:05:29] LilyMichaelShip_: makes sense

[4:06:16] wadderbuffalo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9fIjYnPazc&t=3s
[4:06:28] DerKerim1: Its crazy when you say challenger isnt hard, because I used to be one of these hardstuck silver kids that claimed their team is the fault, then I played with a diamond and got a reality check, since then my mindset changed
[4:06:41] LilyMichaelShip_: PEKW

[6:16:58] junohowwedoit: your csing is bad? is that what you meant?
[6:16:59] PeanutJack: !zwag
[6:16:59] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[6:16:59] trunnpet: want him to spank my booty and call me his bad girl
