[3:16:24] MikeBEASTon: I'll never find the clip, but there was a great moment in a game where quantum was playing with lourlo a while back. It was mid-game and lourlo was talking strategy. Completely out of nowhere -- as if his DVD-logo of a braincell had just hit the corner -- quantum cuts lourlo off mid-word saying, "ME-OWWWW"  That meow has lived rent free in my brain ever since
