[5:17:33] bob493: I hate riot for buffing dirk
[5:17:35] qneeka: did the build changed bcs they removed the armor runes?>
[5:17:35] RenobBob: did u poop a lil?
[5:17:42] bob493: dirk is the most op item in the game
[5:17:56] bob493: Im gonna just do a build with 6 d irks
[5:18:04] Amaresu_: cloth armor = 300g
[5:18:06] qneeka: they don't stack i think
[5:18:08] Amaresu_: dirk 1000g?
[5:18:13] Amaresu_: i forget i think its cheaper now
[5:18:14] Amaresu_: anyway
[5:18:16] bob493: @qneeka lethaltiy stacks
[5:18:16] RenobBob: he heard u
[5:18:18] Amaresu_: if you "hate dirk"
[5:18:24] Amaresu_: and "dirk is op"
[5:18:25] Betatwins: !age
[5:18:26] Nightbot: 26
[5:18:27] Amaresu_: buy 1 cloth armor
[5:18:29] bob493: did they make the lethaltiy a passive?
[5:18:30] Amaresu_: and its a useless item
[5:18:31] bob493: hopefully
[5:18:41] qneeka: @bob493  i think dirks do not stacks, try it in practice
[5:18:43] pailong340: frustrating
[5:18:54] bob493: @qneeka im not doubting, Im just speaking of lethality value
[5:18:56] sept_mber: they don't stack ye
[5:18:59] bob493: ok
[5:19:00] Amaresu_: the tooltip doesnt show unique passive anymore
[5:19:01] RivenTheVillain: locked it in
[5:19:03] Amaresu_: maybe it does stack now
[5:19:03] qneeka: Ya, they made it unique passive
[5:19:16] bob493: ok the lethality being unique is good
[5:19:18] Amaresu_: but idk maybe its just visual mistake
[5:19:18] qneeka: Adrian tried yesterday and the lethality doesnt add i think
[5:19:24] Amaresu_: there s so many visual errors atm
[5:19:27] drakonken: i come in the stream, an i see 1/2 what is happening
[5:19:35] Amaresu_: yeah doesnt surprised me in the end lol

[5:20:37] bob493: ahhhh thank god riot
[5:20:51] bob493: dirk lethality is passive called "gouge"
[5:21:21] Amaresu_: when an item used to have a unique passive it used to say unique passive
[5:21:24] bob493: im glad they had that forsight
[5:21:30] Amaresu_: now it just says "gouge:: ..."
[5:21:37] Amaresu_: so ppl assumed it can stack
[5:21:39] bob493: @Amaresu_ riot used to leave errant passives without a name
[5:21:41] Amaresu_: but its just riot mess
[5:21:54] drakonken: i tested lethality build, to me it sucks... you are too squishy late game
[5:21:59] kon2002: whats the song?
[5:22:03] kon2002: the previosu one
[5:22:13] bob493: @drakonken aye, was just theory crafting 6 dirks
[5:22:19] bob493: 60 lethaltiy for 6600 gold
[5:22:22] bob493: is stupid af
[5:22:26] bob493: doesnt work
[5:22:31] xyz_abc: dirk is 1k now
[5:22:33] Amaresu_: so does everyone know its viper now because of that reddit thread yesterday ?
[5:22:34] bob493: but if it did thatd be broken as hell
[5:22:52] julianthebulian: what’s the build you’re trying right now?
[5:22:59] odolofonos1: ahh the typical inting for voidgrubs, love it
[5:23:20] Amaresu_: there was a thread crying about smurfing cause they lost to viper in emerald-ish elo saying "little did i know its ex rank 1 riven player on enemy team" xdd

[5:31:55] RivenTheVillain: @Bakasable wherever hje pressed r
[5:31:57] Amaresu_: yes it needs a teammate target
[5:32:01] Amaresu_: but its location based
[5:32:20] RivenTheVillain: its more like pantheon ult
[5:32:24] Bakasable: @RivenTheVillain ok, so galio has to time his ulti, he's not following like an alpha strike would

[5:44:54] WonderboltBipen: @Amaresu_ yea hes back
[5:44:59] bob493: but ff'ing *always* loses you games, even if its 2%, your winrate not ff'ing is literally infinitely more than ff'ing
[5:45:11] Kylon1235: @bob493 that is flawed argument
[5:45:15] bob493: itrs not
[5:45:16] Kylon1235: you dont think about mental

[6:08:19] iAzari7: same bud i am not watching i am playing and listening
[6:08:23] Article1: dude no one likes the sound of their own voice. Ive literally never thought about your voice before this
[6:08:25] Vykosa: i mean, it would be weird if this was the voice you had when you were a baby lmao
[6:08:31] RobotexIM: I think you're ugly, no hate though Kappa
[6:08:33] Eli_Narain: some people don’t like American voices that’s fair right

[6:08:39] tagtag_: @viper whats your opinion of ksante? why is he sooo popular in very high elo? I dont understand the “gameplan” of the champ
[6:08:42] Amaresu_: @Article1 its a known phenomenon in psychology
[6:08:46] giadrome8998: I like your voice <3
[6:08:48] Amaresu_: when ppl listen to recordings of their own voice etc

[6:09:58] Amaresu_: the only "Hard" thing for ksante is engaging, you have to learn to flank or separate the threats on enemy team, eventually you have enough tank items to tank everything and go facefirst

[6:24:36] YGbabyToadx: @doctordakota1996 Best way to play riven is to win level 1-3, get a kill at 6 and then from then on get a kill every time you ult
[6:24:47] Amaresu_: @doctordakota1996 you pick riven to get ahead not go even. all the true dmg/mixed dmg champs outscale her anyway and tanks are gonna have value no matter what in teamfights anyway so you need to get ahead to carry.
[6:24:57] ZedBestSin: good lord you're gonna annihilate this olaf

[6:42:54] iAzari7: they'll die before it if they commit
[6:42:56] iAzari7: not stolen
[6:42:59] MpraWins: Correct me if I'm wrong, but qss removes exhaust no? Like the dmg reduction as well
[6:43:14] UltorFortis5: I don't think so
[6:43:19] UltorFortis5: Only cleanse can do that I think
[6:43:20] iAzari7: no that was like 4 seasons ago
[6:43:21] iAzari7: at least
[6:43:27] MpraWins: Ye ik cleanse does that
[6:43:53] UltorFortis5: Just like how you can cleanse ignite but not QSS ignite
[6:43:58] Amaresu_: qss removes exhaust slow
[6:43:59] pan_con_chicharr0n: @MpraWins buying qss into a full ad team seems like a waste of money, rengar should bait it
[6:44:01] Amaresu_: not dmg reduction
[6:44:02] MpraWins: But in my mind qss is cleanse + for suppression
[6:44:09] Amaresu_: only cleanse can remove summoner spells entirely
[6:44:13] yepstonks: TriHard
[6:44:15] Amaresu_: like ignite, exhaust etc
[6:44:22] MpraWins: But only exhaust is the problem from him legit 1v5ing

[8:17:09] Mojamsession: @bob493 interesting, why
[8:17:12] cashbear: @tmtdoped2 play more aggressive you should always win after 6 especially
[8:17:15] redziriuss: @bob493 u can. Especially now bec riven lacks sustain for not going hydra anymore. But good fioras hold W around trades

[8:18:13] liluftw: what u mean
[8:18:19] Mojamsession: @bob493 i mean on first back if you can afford brut vs dirk. i guess if you go dirk you can get another longsword so i get what you're saying
[8:18:22] k1nggggggtop: his goal is to get 20 subs and he got 134 so far
[8:18:27] liluftw: aha
