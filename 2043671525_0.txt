[2:40:31] FrozenLavaReflector: The one thing I have noticed this season is that jungler's mental is at an all time low
[2:41:15] xthe_spacemanx: @FrozenLavaReflector of course, they've just come off a season where they made jg a braindead role but they buffed all the laners this season
[2:41:22] blazin_barbie: not this season lmao
[2:41:25] xthe_spacemanx: no one knows how to jg anymore
[2:42:22] vashytalaty29: maybe WE have to be the jungler. Mwahaha
[2:42:31] blazin_barbie: how did the recording go btw
[2:42:43] FrozenLavaReflector: I've had a jungler tell me today lets not do baron we need to take more towers to secure it first.... all the enemy tier 2 towers were down at this point
[2:42:44] xthe_spacemanx: jg graves to challenger LETSGO
[2:43:18] Mar_Quon: isnt seraphine bot strong
[2:43:28] FrozenLavaReflector: according to LS... Seraphine lux
[2:43:30] blazin_barbie: @frozenlavareflector lmao wha-

[2:43:50] Mar_Quon: LUL my bad
[2:45:05] FrozenLavaReflector: So.. turns out blind caitlyn loses to seraphine lux in lane... and this is with the weaker mechaniocal player as the seraphine lux
[2:45:52] xthe_spacemanx: just get teemo supp
[2:45:54] FrozenLavaReflector: LS approved
[2:45:56] xthe_spacemanx: it's so overtuned
[2:46:22] xthe_spacemanx: jg control with shrooms and neutralized their adc with blinds
[2:46:44] xthe_spacemanx: with new supp item
[2:46:48] xthe_spacemanx: it's crazy good
[2:47:02] xthe_spacemanx: he was the top WR supp for a while

[2:48:08] xthe_spacemanx: is milio not a supp?
[2:48:17] xthe_spacemanx: i didn't pay a lick of attention to him last season
[2:48:33] FrozenLavaReflector: yes, but milio thrives of supporting auto attackers
[2:48:37] FrozenLavaReflector: which hwei is not

[4:47:01] LetheRivers: @KountDuku Work while you listen, I used to listen to Dota 2 and League all the time while doing homework
[4:47:35] lunola_spam: i should be asleep *cries in european*
[4:48:18] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[4:56:44] neon_toxin_: that’s a scary spider
[5:00:59] lunola_spam: how does league actually work
[5:01:18] KountDuku: as in the basic goals of the game?
[5:01:29] KountDuku: or more detailed
[5:01:32] lunola_spam: yeah
[5:02:02] lunola_spam: basics cos i literally know nothing
[5:02:30] KountDuku: so its a 5v5, each player chooses a champion that unlocks and levels up abilities as they get exp from killing the small guys (minions) or other players
[5:02:32] LetheRivers: Neither do I , I just sit and watch cause it looks cool
[5:02:40] FrozenLavaReflector: thoughts on cull start in a farming lane as renanta carry?
[5:03:20] KountDuku: you also get gold if you get the last hit on a minion, get kills, or also just passively that lets you buy items to give you better stats and effects
[5:03:22] lunola_spam: @KountDuku oh cool! how come theres only clyfen and 5up playing if its a 5v5
[5:03:52] LetheRivers: There's 5 team mates they're just playing with randoms
[5:04:07] lunola_spam: ohhhhhhhhh ok makes sense
[5:04:35] KountDuku: for ranked, there is a solo/duo queue which is likely what they are doing
[5:05:00] LetheRivers: I believe 5 is doing du atm
[5:05:03] LetheRivers: Duo*
[5:05:14] KountDuku: in terms of how to win the game, each of the 3 lanes has turrets, the structures with a health bar that attack minions and enemies
[5:05:46] KountDuku: each turret can only be attacked once the one before is destroyed
[5:06:25] lunola_spam: wait where are the lanes
[5:06:36] KountDuku: once you push all the way to an enemys base and destroy the inhibitor turret in a lane, you can destroy the inhibitor for that lane which starts to spawn stronger minions
[5:06:44] lunola_spam: u have to explain it like ur explaining to a child
[5:06:56] KountDuku: so theres a top, mid, and bot lane, with the jungle in between them all
[5:07:02] lunola_spam: @KountDuku is that what they just destroyed?
[5:07:12] KountDuku: if you see the lines on the map that was in the bottom, those are the lanes
[5:07:26] lunola_spam: ohhhhhhh ok
[5:07:38] KountDuku: once an inhibitor is destroyed, you can attack the nexus turrets and eventually destroy the nexus to win the game
[5:08:07] KountDuku: nexus is that big thing that was just destroyed, inhibitors are smaller and theres one in each lane
[5:08:26] lunola_spam: right gotcha
[5:08:29] Sadwikk: yea how does Janna Ezreal go 5/28
[5:08:34] FrozenLavaReflector: down
[5:08:34] maverickx29: dolphinWave

[5:08:41] Sadwikk: that's such a safe lane
[5:08:42] LetheRivers: Gn 5
[5:08:43] lunola_spam: isnt it like midnight?
[5:08:46] Sadwikk: it hurts
[5:09:18] superfreak123: ggs
[5:09:19] lunola_spam: goodnight 5up
[5:09:21] KountDuku: there are also other objectives in the jungle, such as dragon for small permanent stat boots, void grubs for spawning things to help attack turrets, and baron for a temporary buff that enhances your minions and lets you recall to base quicker
[5:09:23] niightdancer: Gn
[5:09:24] Sadwikk: goodnight Mr up
