[2:43:52] elduin: ok

[2:51:31] paaaanda1: they can be 8/0 and still get one shot by a 0/10 annie support

[2:52:42] StreamElements:  Check out my latest TikTok :) : https://www.tiktok.com/@sirhcezofficial
[2:52:46] elduin: Yeah i think its kind of odd .. like they want to be the only ones doing damage,
[2:52:52] RileyJamesBrown: I feel other roles build defensives/change champs but ADCS force an old playstyle
[2:53:19] paaaanda1: to be fair, adc, is THE premier damage role... thats their only job, do damage
[2:53:29] elduin: yeah
