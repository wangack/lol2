[0:09:14] Naxser: @MonteCristo Today the telecom war
[0:09:16] Loxi9: yeah its kinda sad his career trajectory
[0:09:25] Fissiccisst: What happened?
[0:09:29] WashedxUp222: Unreal could there be a protest and no LEC?
[0:09:40] vglarry: What's happening??
[0:09:41] Nerfedgg: what happened with lec
[0:09:50] davesaves0707: do you think void grubs could bring back carry top laners?
[0:10:03] najafan: Backend you mean?
[0:10:06] WashedxUp222: I have to work but i will be listening to it while i spilt wood tomorrow
[0:10:11] WashedxUp222: gonna be a train wreck
[0:10:15] Loxi9: thats one way of bridging the gap between lcs and lec i guess
[0:10:17] Loxi9: good one riot
[0:10:30] SynGG: Did LCS get hit as hard?
[0:10:34] najafan: What.
[0:10:41] Dollt28: such a pity LEC was so good
[0:10:46] Fissiccisst: Can't wait for the 3h pause
[0:10:54] Dollt28: honestly the LEC production > LEC teams Keepo
[0:11:00] UpYerArs: Are they going to hire new people or what
[0:11:03] najafan: If I were the teams I'd, like, pick Yorick as a protest.

[0:12:01] najafan: It's Tencent's stock taking a beating, right? That's why, I'm pretty sure.
[0:12:08] Delf2135: hi @MonteCristo i dont know if its too personnal but u have very good knowledge of pro scene in league of legends and was wondering why ur not hired to be part of the LCS or LEC team. You have a radiophonic voice too
[0:12:15] Loxi9: kit kat is gonna have an 8hr free  advertisement at least
[0:12:18] WashedxUp222: Grass roots type stream
[0:12:27] UpYerArs: Kitkat is going to get more than their money's worth with all the pauses that are going to come this weekend
[0:12:29] najafan: Tencent's stock is down like 30% over a year or something.
[0:12:31] Loxi9: 8 hour kitkat  break  the value
[0:12:39] Fissiccisst: yeah, Riot actively hates Monte LUL
[0:12:50] Condimental: Replays are such a mixed bag because you miss out on the actual game
[0:12:50] antropsss: @montecristo big fan over here! love the new GenG roster, could you tell me what you think they ideal road they should take to become the best team possible?  since you know a lot about each player and their best forms and playstyle
[0:12:54] WaystedMined: Tecent lost a lot of stock price because of the Chinese game monetization changes that the CCP made.
[0:13:03] Giiino: code red
[0:13:05] Phaetox: NotLikeThis
[0:13:06] Loxi9: wouldnt it feel good to have them come begging to u at least
[0:13:11] Dollt28: button for BRO Kappa
[0:13:14] Mauware: LUL
[0:13:16] dharh: lmao

[0:13:43] Nerfedgg: lmfao
[0:13:44] najafan: Just checked
[0:13:47] Fissiccisst: @MonteCristo was that the nephew hot take alarm?
[0:13:52] UpYerArs: Rekkless is the best western ADC and its not even an argument
[0:13:54] TakinR: thoughts on French literature (NOT Dumas)
[0:13:57] Nerfedgg: which region seems better right now lck vs lpl
[0:14:12] Loxi9: imagine being a life long monte fan, coming into his stream and making a slightly bad take because ur not very good at analyzing league, and he hits u with that
[0:14:14] Loxi9: monkaW
[0:14:14] Naxser: @MonteCristo Exists some people that worst as your ally than as your enemy

[0:14:57] viajantecansado: geng is hype man
[0:15:14] viajantecansado: i didn’t see this game yet
[0:15:53] fartnugget45: I see Canyon and I think to myself "Yes"
[0:15:57] Giiino: do you have a favourite caster in esports atm?
[0:16:04] Naxser: @MonteCristo is a even year and Beryl want worlds in those years :v
[0:16:04] viajantecansado: is kalista that good in the meta?
[0:16:12] WashedxUp222: morgan LUL
[0:16:16] Phaetox: Kinda surprised to still see effort around
[0:16:19] Delf2135: between T1, GenG and HLE which team is the strongest in ur opinion

[0:17:59] arthradot: canyon AP jg 🙏
[0:18:17] AntiquusTonitrus_3: i tihnk xun play it better then canyon
[0:18:23] Loxi9: brand corki is amazing into enemy comp i think
[0:18:26] fartnugget45: good draft on both sides tbh
[0:18:27] Loxi9: they kinda just clump
[0:18:58] asphy0396: you don’t pick graves into canyon and expect to win
[0:18:59] hibbjibb: We bang we bang
[0:20:21] gorwings: with LCK saying they have monetization issues, why aren't they putting more western ads on the english LCK broadcast?
[0:21:14] Loxi9: uh is it exactly ethical for hanwha life to sponsor the league that they have a team in iwdThink
[0:21:37] Zelgius: Isn't it kind of easy to muscle in with BRO haivng no engage?
[0:22:10] LD_Drew: do you think senna lanes will still be op when riot nerfs the double support item strategy?
[0:22:39] antropsss: what development or change would you like to see this split?
[0:23:03] commando1814: does monte know brand hit 58+% wr in high ranks ?

[0:23:10] commando1814: that's was pretty absurd
[0:23:31] Loxi9: its still 55
[0:23:43] Loxi9: that is not a balanced champ :|
[0:23:59] commando1814: fuck me ! 55 is the nerfed version
[0:24:00] fljqpy: not DK games peepoSad
[0:24:04] Zelgius: it's not 55 lol
[0:24:26] Zelgius: it's just over 54 with the first 24h included
[0:24:29] anyonemiring: @MonteCristo who do you think are the top 5 teams world wide this early season?
[0:24:31] Loxi9: its 54 for diamond+
[0:24:34] Loxi9: mb
[0:24:36] MonteCristo: https://www.op.gg/champions?position=jungle&tier=diamond_plus
[0:24:38] commando1814: do we know what the hotfix did yet ?
[0:24:51] Loxi9: thats still absurd
[0:25:14] Zelgius: that includes pre-hotfix numbers so you can subtract another 2%
[0:25:25] antropsss: Hey Monte, what type of metas do enjoy the most to watch and what meta do you think is the best for the game? (assuming they are different)
[0:25:27] najafan: In yugioh they call a format a tier 0 format when 1 deck has >60% representation in top cut. Is there some number where we should say a champ is tier 0 based on their ban/pick rate? Ksante is like 73% pb, right?
[0:25:41] Loxi9: btw 54% for 11% pickrate
[0:25:59] Shobes572: cheer100 seeing the brand jungle made me so happy
[0:26:04] Loxi9: for context seraphine has a 54% at less than a third of that
[0:26:06] frieza558: I remember that Yugioh episode
[0:26:09] commando1814: I do wonder is the nerf hammer on 2 x support items changes botlane
[0:26:09] Loxi9: disgusting
[0:27:00] najafan: @frieza558 True, the teledad episode where the deck cost hundreds of dollars was one a lot of people loved.
[0:27:05] commando1814: getting a drag with sera senna has to be huge
[0:27:14] commando1814: 6 mins timer is huge
[0:27:52] antropsss: do you think the LPL is overall weaker than last year because of the roster changes?
[0:27:54] commando1814: will sera still be an elite botlaner with the 2x support nerf ?
[0:28:34] fljqpy: how could u tell lol its new season new map new meta
[0:28:34] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:28:47] Loxi9: i think lng will be fine once they stop playing mark over hang..
[0:28:50] fljqpy: just prognostication at that point
[0:29:01] TheBasedTaka: do you think nip in lpl is a good business decision?
[0:29:06] addaberry: My bet is China will be cooking by Worlds
[0:29:10] commando1814: her items are still good as the storm razed nerf s doesn't impact her
[0:29:12] lazink: do you prefer top heavy leagues, or league parody?
[0:29:19] antropsss: I really wish Tarzan came back to one of theLCK’s top teams
[0:29:42] Loxi9: old man canyon
[0:29:47] Loxi9: fingers too rheumatic to press f
[0:30:00] fljqpy: canyon got graved
[0:30:28] commando1814: 10 min ghostblade ? ewwww
[0:30:59] asphy0396: you can react yeah
[0:31:00] Loxi9: yea u  can flash out of it
[0:31:07] mifot: doesn't graves pop the blast cone himself after that and kill anyway?
[0:31:09] awoogawooogawoo: yep
[0:31:09] vriesea97: yea
[0:31:21] Jirin_: Yes, you are correct
[0:31:25] WashedxUp222: looked like he was trying to blast plant
[0:31:28] asphy0396: no he can’t reach you prob @mifot
[0:31:38] fljqpy: didnt see
[0:31:41] asphy0396: i think u just flash the q bounce though
[0:31:45] asphy0396: to be safe
[0:31:54] RomanticCreampie: azir corki ResidentSleeper
[0:31:59] antropsss: what do you think is the reason chovy is unable to perform internationally?
[0:32:08] fljqpy: sera senna ResidentSleeper
[0:32:09] awoogawooogawoo: 1xn would flash that
[0:32:21] Nytrodark: @montecristo did you guys talk about the new overwatch esports? its kinda pathetic tbh to them.
[0:32:23] asphy0396: interesting that canyon goes triple tonic
[0:32:40] Jirin_: Maybe he thought it wasn't worth the flash, no objectives up and now graves has no f for drag
[0:32:48] asphy0396: so he can buy t2 boots early i guess
[0:33:01] fljqpy: O O F
[0:33:03] Fissiccisst: didn't blizzard just layoff a bunch of people as well?
[0:33:05] dharh: yikes
[0:33:07] asphy0396: LOL!
[0:33:20] fartnugget45: maybe they forgot that a package corki was at dragon
[0:33:27] Loxi9: gotta fight them before their champs power spikes, otherwise it wouldnt be fair

[0:33:52] Corrrr_: he went tp started doran shield
[0:33:53] asphy0396: and aphelios started supp item
[0:33:54] fljqpy: senna sera lane LUL
[0:34:02] Ludastian: lehends has a nice flash r in this fight
[0:34:27] Gikeuri13: @MonteCristo I'm up to episode 7 on Blue Eye Samurai. Show is fantastic
[0:34:27] commando1814: Brion about to go full Rodney dangerfield - I ain't got no respect
[0:34:35] asphy0396: they have a dragon already
[0:34:39] asphy0396: why do we need 2nd
[0:34:41] asphy0396: XDDD
[0:35:12] Respect_Dat1: and at around 20 minutes is when seraphine/senna actually start to get strong
[0:35:14] UpYerArs: @MonteCristo cabochard is a flat earther just fyi
[0:35:22] asphy0396: no he’s not
[0:35:24] Loxi9: he isnt
[0:35:27] Loxi9: but its funny
[0:35:35] asphy0396: i hate context tho yeah!
[0:35:56] Zelgius: Summoners rift is flat ergo the world is flat
[0:36:05] asphy0396: wait shit ur right…
[0:36:16] hibbjibb: Lord Morgan would never run it down
[0:36:17] Lamynator: I think your second child took away your beautiful mouse writing and it makes me very sad to see
[0:36:20] Shobes572: your analysis is so good. have you ever tried coaching 🤪
[0:36:23] UpYerArs: I'm changing the narrative
[0:36:33] asphy0396: so weird aarrox doesn’t just take plates top
[0:36:37] Loxi9: @Shobes572 unfortunately sivir isnt in meta so he cant
[0:37:06] Shobes572: @loxi9 Omegalul
[0:37:15] fljqpy: lulhands so good wtf
[0:37:28] fljqpy: what happened to KT
[0:37:39] arthradot: blue aphelios ult into that waaaa
[0:37:45] Loxi9: boah
[0:37:46] Jirin_: Corki package was clean too
[0:37:57] najafan: If Cabochard was a flat earther, that would explain why he's refused to play Maokai. There are no trees on the flat earth.
[0:38:06] MissingMatter: Imagine just walking away when you get tp and discovering you got two.
[0:38:08] mifot: aphelios juuust gets blue gun
[0:38:09] asphy0396: r flash was so nice
[0:38:16] Lamynator: nautilus wasn't even in the brush when he hooked, Bro doesn't even get that excuse
[0:38:17] plsnocopypesto: yeah I felt so awful watching them contest with sera comp against package this early
[0:38:39] Loxi9: its crazy how GEN easily cooked up a counter into a champ that ran NA for 3 years straight :)
[0:38:40] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:39:03] plsnocopypesto: true
[0:39:07] fljqpy: nah its just bro gaming
[0:39:25] fljqpy: what are they even doing there
[0:39:37] virtuoso_blades: yeah that’s a bukkake scene if I ever seen one
[0:40:02] plsnocopypesto: and now we ff
[0:40:13] WashedxUp222: a ff angle
[0:40:23] fljqpy: went to spectate geng taking drake, then give up grubs
[0:40:23] najafan: @Loxi9 Is it reasonable to draw conclusions off of a game between BRO and GEN? I don't think so.
[0:40:24] Phaetox: Hard to root for this version of Bro
[0:40:28] fljqpy: thats some KC macro
[0:40:39] Shobes572: @montecristo mind controlling BRO is why canyon didn’t flash and died to graves. tactical inting
[0:40:43] madiiiman: what do grubs do? im ouy of the loop
[0:40:45] najafan: Maybe it's a counter, maybe not.
[0:40:52] najafan: But, uh.
[0:40:58] Loxi9: @najafan i mean conceptually these champs are just really good into seraphine
[0:41:06] najafan: It's also these teams.
[0:41:07] fartnugget45: first 11 minutes went great. then they just int at 12 minutes for funsies
[0:41:17] Respect_Dat1: @madiiiman makes everyone deal extra damage to turrets... quite a substantial amount
[0:41:30] TheBasedTaka: they didnt even send it they just stood there lost
[0:41:33] fartnugget45: corki is working on it this game
[0:41:44] najafan: @Loxi9 Some of them, yeah?
[0:41:50] WashedxUp222: Thats too good for them just send them the other way into the void
[0:41:50] Loxi9: idk i dont think level of play factors into the fact that brand likes to fight into teams that hold hands
[0:42:01] madiiiman: lol hte ui is growing. now we needed a grub counter on the top
[0:42:06] Loxi9: yea brand aphelios w/ blue gun corki all really good into that comp
[0:42:09] 2022LINKS: this corki skin is kinda op, the rockets look so small
[0:42:09] antropsss: monte, what would be the way you’d get involved with the league scene directly? dream scenario
[0:42:39] Jirin_: Canyon doesn't seem to be on the same page, or he's just not giving BRO any respect.
[0:42:44] Giiino: what happened
[0:42:47] dharh: we are so back
[0:42:48] arthradot: morgan quite literally ate the back line
[0:42:53] RomanticCreampie: lehends giveth
[0:43:07] madiiiman: zeus took control of aatrox for a moment there
[0:43:08] forever_sorc: lol
[0:43:20] plsnocopypesto: Where is blud going
[0:43:24] madiiiman: morgan posessed by. the spirit of zeus for 20 seconds
[0:43:27] Jirin_: Canyon trolling
[0:43:27] Loxi9: hes drifting
[0:43:28] plsnocopypesto: Hot date or what
[0:43:47] gypeee: peyz shouldve just pressed ult after his cleanse no?

[0:43:48] madiiiman: why did peyz keep walking forward after cleanse?
[0:44:01] madiiiman: peyz cleanses and takes another 2 steps forward for no reason into death
[0:44:09] torgoat: lehends went too far
[0:44:33] Zelgius: Peyz walks into the Senna W I think?
[0:44:41] madiiiman: lord morgan has arrived
[0:44:41] Jirin_: Canyon did this last split very often, just way out of position
[0:44:43] AndyHayes: I'm legitimately surprised Graves is not disabled right now
[0:44:54] fljqpy: canyon with the ambush
[0:44:59] najafan: @Loxi9 But Seraphine doesn't need to be full stacked, she just needs like 2 people together and then some flanks. And Graves and Aatrox are compatible with that.
[0:45:09] Neumonyx: oh, its my fav time of the evening - Bangers Only w Monte
[0:45:37] HolySpartan: have there been any players that have surprised you so far this year in lck?
[0:46:03] tmihee: CANYON ON TANKS CLEAN AF
[0:46:07] fljqpy: dk 🙏
[0:46:10] Jirin_: Who do you think will be the weakest link on this Gen G team?
[0:46:27] Uberblacktorne: Do you still watch all the matches amongst the lower teams in your own time?
[0:46:30] J__Carson: 1xn on TT is pretty solid
[0:46:32] fljqpy: shoemaker just ad lb him
[0:46:41] Loxi9: i dont think graves and aatrox can flank with nautilus and ksante if they mark them correctly.. @najafan

[0:49:04] commando1814: are you going to enjoy R6 at Si I know you did a turney for them a little bit ago
[0:49:31] najafan: @Loxi9 It's difficult, sure. But the mere fact that this is how they want to play reduces the power of Aphelios/Corki/Brand. You're no longer saying that this is a *counter* to Seraphine, but that this is just a generically good comp for teamfighting. Which, uh, yeah. It is. But there are other choices here. It's not like Seraphine in particular is being countered.
[0:49:37] fljqpy: blaming canyon now LUL
[0:49:39] commando1814: Brazil is still damn damn good in R6
[0:49:41] Jirin_: Canyon has chovy and kiin, compared to last season showmaker and canna. Surely he can't fail that badly
[0:49:49] Primo51: is this the game when senna at one point goes boom 100 to 0
[0:49:51] TheBasedTaka: @commando1814 is r6 growing?
[0:50:01] Neumonyx: new camera or lighting settings, looks sharper
[0:50:10] commando1814: eu NA latam - yeah
[0:50:15] plsnocopypesto: better get some single player streams in there. Deus Ex play through was banger FeelsOkayMan
[0:50:34] commando1814: @thebasedtaka it's doing alright . still esports winter but doing well
[0:50:41] Shimmerz: would you rather go on a date with wanderstave or brickfist
[0:50:46] trueaether: Regular Season Kiin is such a monster
[0:51:19] plsnocopypesto: Yeah Effort was hard griefing. Caedrel was perma malding about his performance in every game.
[0:51:30] Phaetox: Who is worse bro or kc?
[0:51:31] plsnocopypesto: Said that he should only pick rakan
[0:51:40] TheBasedTaka: what was effort even poking?

[0:52:20] Lamynator: would the ults make much of a difference in that fight?

[0:54:06] trueaether: something better than aatrox
[0:54:20] Loxi9: @najafan idk, i mentioned how brand and corki are good into seraphine's primary gameplay pattern, u mentioned possible counterplay, and i responded why that wouldnt work
[0:54:30] plsnocopypesto: Effort on tanks or I will protest
[0:54:42] Loxi9: @najafan also brand is one of the best champs to build healing cut on, which is great here
[0:55:15] Loxi9: so idk what u mean by this not being a counter to seraphine specifically
[0:55:22] Primo51: oh that's the moment

[0:55:36] hibbjibb: wha

[0:57:51] Respect_Dat1: that's why corki is usually first picked
[0:57:53] andyfatknob: looks fun to play
[0:58:01] HolySpartan: he chunks aatrox down near bot inhib for like 30% too. and aatrox is the tankiest person on bro
[0:58:10] LastArchangeI: and everyone laughed when LCK started corki Azir shenanigans again
[0:58:12] hibbjibb: geeez
[0:58:13] 2022LINKS: riot allows lategame corki to be like this while kayle is not even this strong at 16

[0:59:53] RomanticCreampie: wtfffffffff
[0:59:55] Respect_Dat1: i fucking love the camera work when they do the quick zoom ins on corki rockets
[0:59:58] hibbjibb: How would that work with anivia? She might be able to abuse malignance
[0:59:59] plsnocopypesto: thats what Effort gets for picking Senna
[1:00:10] 2022LINKS: i wish kayle would be this broken when shes scaled
[1:00:11] najafan: @Loxi9 Except the counterplay is just hard to execute, it's still the primary mode of gameplay. It doesn't *not work*. If they get the flank off the plan collapses, it doesn't counter anything. Nor are Corki, Aphelios and Brand at all interesting here, they're just sources of AOE damage. AOE is useful in team fights? Who's surprised? If it was Karthus, Malz, and, say, Sivir, (if she was in a good state), we'd have the same result. All you're saying is "poke loses to team fighting".
[1:00:11] arthradot: corki presses his no play game button
[1:00:22] Respect_Dat1: hoooly paragraph
[1:00:55] KaelnarTV: The Corki rocket was a big one, not a huge deal, but it was a big one. So not quite as bonky, still insane though.
[1:00:59] vriesea97: also removed lethality that corki didnt utilize
[1:01:18] najafan: @najafan This isn't something specifically a *seraphine* counter. It's just poke vs teamfight. There are actual champion counters. This isn't that.
[1:01:22] mifot: it doesn't have to be magic damage
[1:01:45] Respect_Dat1: holy shit i didnt know about the magic resist reduction on top of all that
[1:01:51] madiiiman: imagine if kog ult still had execute scaling
[1:01:53] mifot: the pool counts as a spell, i guess, yeah
[1:01:58] Loxi9: @najafan thats so fucking pedantic what? Seraphine is a champ that forces your team to play a specific way, so when you draft in a way thats good into that then its a  counter
[1:02:18] madiiiman: so karthus
[1:02:22] madiiiman: Kappa
[1:02:22] Loxi9: @najafan and ur really saying aatrox and graves can somehow get onto corki and brand? how would they do that in a neutral game state?
[1:02:31] mifot: first strike applies to everything and then there's the muramana tick
[1:02:31] fljqpy: need to code eclipse differently yea
[1:03:28] Loxi9: there was one fight aatrox could play there, it was when canyon literally ran into 4 people for fun
[1:03:32] mifot: second sentence
[1:03:33] Loxi9: insane mode of gameplay there
[1:03:38] najafan: @Loxi9 No it's not pedantic. Consider old Maokai. His passive healed based on spells near him. AP bruiser Fizz was a MAOKAI counter, because it beat him, specifically.
[1:03:39] Phaetox: No muramana is on ability hit too
[1:03:45] Respect_Dat1: read the second half
[1:03:54] fljqpy: yea they buffed it to hell
[1:03:59] Zelgius: Thats why Jayce uses muramana
[1:04:19] Respect_Dat1: stacking % bonus damage from all those different items/runes holy....

[1:04:28] fljqpy: if not only ezreal can use muramana
[1:04:41] Loxi9: @najafan it is pedantic because you're specifically arguing for one definition of the word counter, when colloquially it can just mean something way more general than that
[1:04:57] mifot: malig is technically flat pen on every rocket too
[1:05:28] hitmon_gg: midnabRip
[1:05:28] fljqpy: what a case of misappropiated item design
[1:05:35] najafan: @Loxi9 No, I'm saying that there's countering a champion vs countering a team comp/playstyle. Which is very much not pedantic.
[1:05:36] fljqpy: they did not want this to be used on corki
[1:05:53] Loxi9: and im saying enemy team counters seraphine's playstyle
[1:05:56] Respect_Dat1: NotLikeThis that is crazy
[1:05:58] Loxi9: how did u know i meant champion counter
[1:05:59] madiiiman: k ive seen enough delete that fuckin item
[1:06:09] Loxi9: did i say lane counter
[1:06:10] unknown87644: what about tri force?
[1:06:13] Zelgius: They just missed the malignance eclipse interaction, it's very champ specific
[1:06:15] fljqpy: accidentally OP LUL
[1:06:18] 2022LINKS: malignance is actually so bad except on corki
[1:06:23] Phaetox: I got to use it on kogmaw in aram and the ground was perma burning
[1:06:24] najafan: @Loxi9 You literally said "champ".
[1:06:25] sznszl: just slap like 20sec cd on it
[1:06:26] 2022LINKS: no other mages actually like this item
[1:06:31] lazink: Someone on the dev team must main corki
[1:06:40] Loxi9: yes in the context that seraphine forces ur teamcomp to play one style
[1:06:41] Zelgius: @2022LINKS Teemo etc, do some homework
[1:06:45] madiiiman: kassadin cud use this
[1:06:46] Loxi9: no one cares about how seraphine plays in lane
[1:06:47] trueaether: Malignance is good on Karthus and Velkoz as well at the very leasy
[1:06:52] hibbjibb: They could give a ~30 second CD on malignance
[1:06:55] Loxi9: what the fuck is the issue here
[1:07:01] zionsick: Add a cooldown to it?
[1:07:13] hibbjibb: So that corki/kog cant abuse it
[1:07:22] fljqpy: its just malignance causing eclipse to proc
[1:07:28] fljqpy: aside from that its all cool
[1:07:43] najafan: @Loxi9 That you said "champ" and I responded to that? If it was a miscommunication, you misspoke, that's fine.
[1:07:49] najafan: We can move on.
[1:07:52] awoogawooogawoo: nice super balance
[1:07:58] Loxi9: no i didnt mis speak like what
[1:08:01] commando1814: wouldn't it be strong on swain
[1:08:03] Loxi9: u assumed i meant lane counter
[1:08:06] Loxi9: to seraphine
[1:08:10] BaconBitz_KB: There will never be a build more synergistic than this lol
[1:08:10] najafan: No I didn't.
[1:08:11] Loxi9: for 0 reason

[1:08:23] squeakssssss: squeakssssss subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:08:24] najafan: I assumed you meant it countered the champ rather than the team comp.
[1:08:31] najafan: You keep saying the latter, not the former.
[1:08:35] fljqpy: i dread the psychoanalysis of that video
[1:08:41] Loxi9: if a champ forces the team comp into one style of play
[1:08:48] Loxi9: countering that style inherently counters that champ
[1:08:53] Loxi9: it may not be specifically in lane
[1:08:54] Zelgius: why don't you two do this in DMs or something
[1:08:56] Zelgius: lmao

[1:32:29] captainkrajick: It didn't go out of meta I think
[1:32:34] captainkrajick: It's just a secondary pick
[1:32:49] Udslusher: my guess would be that ap tops are suffering vs rookern
[1:32:51] Zelgius: Corki is stronger + requires AP damage in top or jungle
[1:33:23] meIIerr: damn nami getting 1k shut down
[1:33:26] meIIerr: that's bad
[1:33:34] trueaether: Karis is really trying

[1:39:21] fljqpy: LUL

[1:41:34] lightidentity: Monte isn't it interesting this KT vs T1 match is like 80% of the players from the T1 vs DRX worlds final

[1:42:17] IrishProphet: Which AFC West team do you hate the most? And why is it the raiders?
[1:42:25] commando1814: @zionsick don't give him hope
[1:42:44] Loxi9: recommend the long goodbye, i heard its quite different from the film
[1:42:56] professor_wormbog_: The Chargers generally just get apathy, which is somehow more sad than hate
[1:43:07] commando1814: lions ravens would be an outstanding superbowl
[1:43:10] IrishProphet: The best part of the AFC West is that everyone hates each other. And also everyone hates the raiders. Including the raiders fans.
[1:43:10] bobby_deol: I just started watching NFL this year. any advice on how to learn it and what team to support?
[1:43:19] trueaether: Are you less of a fan of LNG now that Tarzan is gone, and if so who's your LPL squad of choice
[1:43:28] Loxi9: i think mark is much worse
[1:43:31] Loxi9: unfortunately
[1:43:51] commando1814: @bobby_deol fun coaches fun players the jerseys looks badass . anything is fine stick with em
[1:44:10] arthradot: dom says tarzan is a choker. do you agree?
[1:44:14] Prepo9: I will always root for the team with JackeyLove but I have a soft spot for BLG this year
[1:44:15] Ludastian: the top half of the lck is looking pretty exciting
[1:44:19] commando1814: my falcons got the Dc from the rams and idk how to feel about it
[1:44:22] Loxi9: would kt tarzan get you back on the hype train
[1:44:30] commando1814: the nfc south is a god damn dumpster
[1:44:42] Parkbench22: do you still have any day to day involvement with league esports?
[1:44:55] bobby_deol: @commando1814 after all the hype for Bellichek
[1:45:02] Respect_Dat1: @bobby_deol just watch games, if u have questions about what penalties are, just look them up... also u dont have to pick a team
[1:45:03] trueaether: @Loxi9 please don't suggest subjecting Tarzan to BarryL

[1:45:37] bobby_deol: LEC this weekend Pepelaugh
[1:45:39] Loxi9: @trueaether i think playing bdd would offset that LUL
[1:45:47] Loxi9: surely
[1:45:58] Bucsfan914: @bobby_deol <3
[1:46:20] awoogawooogawoo: xdd
[1:46:21] fIuffee: Would you work for riot if you were guaranteed $50k a year? That's good money.
[1:46:31] awoogawooogawoo: 12hr lec game later?
[1:46:32] bobby_deol: and also there is no competition like in CS with Blast, ESL
[1:46:37] Respect_Dat1: @fIuffee 50k/yr is good money?
[1:46:43] KorlackJ: LOL
[1:46:52] commando1814: but riot also has huge issues being in two very expensive cities-50 k in la is ass
[1:46:53] trueaether: @Loxi9 idk why, but that sounds like it would be the most passive mid/jg in existence
[1:46:55] arthradot: $50k a year, especially if you had to relocate to LA holy
[1:46:56] Parkbench22: 50k/yr in LA, a totally reasonable salary for a family!
[1:47:02] colorblindgenius: what did you built for yourself? Real estate, ETFs?
[1:47:13] Jeffp2662: they laid off a pile of people. though it was a great severance package
[1:47:14] Parkbench22: (sarcasm in case that wasn't clear)
[1:47:22] Loxi9: @trueaether maybe im not up to date on bdd, but he used to be really good at playing with his junglers
[1:47:40] Zeroantagonist: Returning league player. How did LMS/PCS region fall off so hard from TPA worlds and then subsequent flash wolves "KR killer" era
[1:47:49] IEatLamas: beautiful combo
[1:48:01] Loxi9: @Zeroantagonist mostly lpl poached all of their really good coaching staff
[1:48:12] commando1814: I just looked at why we didn't take bilicheck monte ! it was going to most likely be bill as gm assistant and josh McDumdum as oc . ---- that's risky
[1:48:21] commando1814: @loxi9 yuuup
[1:48:34] Zeroantagonist: F
[1:48:34] StuntmanStan: some would say they never left china

[1:49:04] Kaniskion: monkalaugh
[1:49:14] najafan: @Loxi9 His response was "no dash, no reason to play. Jayce only works because lethality items have a ton of ms". RIP
[1:49:50] StuntmanStan: to br fair you get the same awnsers from most nations
[1:50:22] Parkbench22: riot games alienating you out of league however long ago was legit the point i lost interest overall
[1:50:22] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:50:24] najafan: The US's response is "we accept that China thinks Taiwan doesn't exist. Aside from that, no comment."

[1:51:57] Cuix23: What do you think the era of peak League was/is? For playing or for viewing

[1:53:19] commando1814: @loxi9 not sure I get that one . I imagine tos ?
[1:53:40] IEatLamas: It's sad, really.. can't the korean gov do something about that pls :)
[1:53:40] najafan: And S5 STILL had crazy talent in Korea.
[1:53:47] JAKEW369: the kt arrows team that won 2014 summer was my favourite team ever

[1:54:31] Warzard908: inhuman reactions
[1:54:34] Prepo9: Those 2 Samsung teams were so much fun to watch. Really wish Dade's career wouldve turned out differently
[1:54:37] edenjtv: what did you like most about Score’s gameplay?
[1:54:46] Loxi9: u didnt mention it, im sure u were griefing privately win KT, LNG, and GEN (with score coaching) all lost within the span of a week at worlds :P @MonteCristo
[1:54:52] fIuffee: Is it true that you've secretly finished challenger every season yet pretend not to play the game?

[1:58:57] Krethas: I've been a follower of pro league since the IPL5 days, despite having never played the game. Watching Doa and you casting the game really got me hooked, to the point where I actually looked up the wiki to understand how the game worked

[2:02:31] commando1814: I'll have to laugh like that when Travis kelce drops a clutch 3rd down on sunday
[2:02:36] najafan: Most important series you missed.
[2:02:37] J__Carson: it was close monte
[2:02:52] najafan: @commando1814 Why do you hate world peace?
[2:02:56] brandofan2: @brandofan2 think its mostly the udyr play
[2:02:58] Prepo9: Absolute worst case is you burn both GALAs summoners
[2:03:15] fruge2: turns out absolute worst case was hoya's brain exploded
[2:03:18] commando1814: @najafan world peace - with the chiefs ? no sir !
[2:03:40] Professional_Aellith: Watching K’sante players get bullied is so cathartic
[2:03:52] fljqpy: losing to zika is ok
[2:04:01] brandofan2: hoya gameplay
[2:04:06] najafan: @commando1814 Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift getting married and having like 30 kids is how we heal this broken country. It will unite everyone across the political and cultural spectrum.
[2:04:11] Amosdragon: Sometimes it's just a skill issue
[2:04:21] LastArchangeI: Simple case of top diff
[2:04:22] J__Carson: this is a ad dif this game
[2:04:22] jgeo_: Zika good, Hoya mid
[2:04:29] kapzu44: zika is just better monte
[2:04:31] arthradot: the unfactored variable of hoya brain
[2:04:35] commando1814: @najafan I'm sure Denver would actively Sussede
[2:04:58] kraethan: I just got here how is 1xn pronounced?
[2:05:01] pesukarhupoju: only 2 trillion players to choose natively should we import players like hoya
[2:05:07] najafan: @commando1814 They can do that, so long as they don't secede.
[2:05:13] najafan: @kraethan "Array"
[2:05:16] commando1814: hahahah
[2:06:00] kraethan: Thanks

[2:06:35] Loxi9: @najafan i just got that joke
[2:06:37] fljqpy: believe in lng scout
[2:07:10] fljqpy: summer 2023 will be repeated
[2:08:18] trueaether: games like these are really awkward when both teams have exactly 1 real form of engage
[2:08:20] Loxi9: monte do u have any insight into when lucian builds a support item
[2:08:29] Loxi9: or is it just based on how the player is feeling
[2:08:48] Prepo9: This feels like a really low damage Azir build
[2:09:05] Loxi9: 1xn doesnt rely on broken game mechanics
[2:09:16] Loxi9: he relies on good old elbowgrease and talent
[2:09:20] trueaether: @Loxi9 LUL
[2:09:36] najafan: None of that woke double support item bullshit
[2:09:46] najafan: Just good old fashioned mechanics
[2:09:52] trueaether: is CDR boots standard on lucian now?
[2:10:06] fruge2: double support laneswap, ultimate resident sleeper
[2:10:20] najafan: You and your avocado toast and "sharing cs"
[2:10:27] najafan: Not in my lane.
[2:10:31] Loxi9: i miss lane swaps a lot actually
[2:11:04] AzureCatalyst: That was a goo nami wave holy
[2:11:05] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:11:05] Prepo9: Beautiful from Ucal
[2:11:07] najafan: Oh, wait, avocado toast is milennial.
[2:11:15] najafan: He'd be against pronouns.
[2:11:18] Loxi9: ucal just pulled the faker play
[2:11:20] Loxi9: xD
[2:11:20] AzureCatalyst: These nami engages make those K Corp Nami Waves seem so bad
[2:11:23] 2020mazdacx5: Gotta say the thing I miss most in life is waking up at 4am to watch OGN streams with Doa and Monte
[2:11:35] direpants2: that's insane that still caught gala even with flash
[2:11:35] AzureCatalyst: Chew Chew>
[2:11:36] commando1814: @trueaether mhmm
[2:11:37] 2020mazdacx5: my two dead sisters are a close second.
[2:11:47] AzureCatalyst: I think the Qi sound is a Qi/Chieu Sound
[2:11:58] pianoluver: i hate the graphic bug with azir
[2:11:58] Loxi9: @2020mazdacx5 macabre
[2:12:02] pianoluver: common bug
[2:12:03] a_lonely_observer: Skt t1 xn
[2:12:03] AzureCatalyst: I think observer bug
[2:12:04] kapzu44: yes
[2:12:05] Thewombatofcombat: all 3 flashed
[2:12:08] jgeo_: That's like the only angle he can do on the sweep that works
[2:12:16] Prepo9: Eastern Azirs just dont hesitate when they see a play like this
[2:12:18] kapzu44: observer bug 100%
[2:12:20] Loxi9: yeah that flash bug has been in the game for YEARS
[2:12:27] Loxi9: its infuriating
[2:12:28] AzureCatalyst: I guess there was a weird thing with the bubble hitting azir with the utlti buffering?
[2:12:33] najafan: I dropped a full grade in my Abstract Algebra course (A to B ) because I watched S5 spring split out of the corner of my eye during class, lmao
[2:12:36] pianoluver: happens with azir E as well
[2:12:45] AzureCatalyst: No wait that's not bubble I thinought he got hit by a milio kick
[2:12:57] kapzu44: @MonteCristo ucal was too fast that bugged
[2:12:58] Krethas: qi is more like a sharp cee, as in chee without the H part
[2:13:11] AzureCatalyst: But Qiu would be like Chew right?
[2:13:12] Zeroantagonist: Zeroantagonist subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:13:20] najafan: But Abstract Algebra is lame, so it's fine
[2:13:22] kraethan: Ucal won the staring contest
[2:13:22] AzureCatalyst: That's how I'm pronouncing it in my head Qiu as Chew chew
[2:13:27] Loxi9: @AzureCatalyst more like chyo chyo
[2:13:32] AzureCatalyst: Ah
[2:13:40] AzureCatalyst: I cannot fucking pronounce chinese names wihtout Pinyin
[2:13:42] 2020mazdacx5: You should stream in a silly suit for nostalgia
[2:13:45] AzureCatalyst: I need the fucking accent markers
[2:13:50] Prepo9: Eastern Azirs just dont hesitate when they see a play like this 󠀀
[2:14:09] Loxi9: time to learn mandarin buddy
[2:14:09] pesukarhupoju: reverse saken
[2:14:13] BGilbz: SSumday
[2:14:19] Krethas: no, like chee as in cheese, not see, but without the h part
[2:14:25] najafan: How do you pronounce "xianxia", guess.
[2:14:29] Krethas: but hey, in general you just get used to Chinese player names, since the language is tonal anyway
[2:14:35] Krethas: *Chinese names getting butchered
[2:14:45] Loxi9: @Krethas its really hard that consonant,
[2:14:50] Loxi9: doesnt exist in english
[2:14:56] Krethas: I don't think the consonant exists in English
[2:14:58] AzureCatalyst: Shian Sha (
[2:15:00] AzureCatalyst: Qeee
[2:15:01] AzureCatalyst: Ye
[2:15:03] tooeasytoforget: bhutter
[2:15:05] AzureCatalyst: Without the h sound is right
[2:15:05] Krethas: qeee? Qii?
[2:15:06] AzureCatalyst: That's good
[2:15:07] verylingual: the ch in cheese is good enough as a non chinese speaker
[2:15:09] AzureCatalyst: Qii Qii is about right
[2:15:11] verylingual: dont listen to this dude i am a linguist
[2:15:11] Loxi9: @MonteCristo the ts sound approximates the q sound
[2:15:16] a_lonely_observer: GIGACHAD Thunder cock gaming
[2:15:24] Mizzzraim: chi chi?
[2:15:27] Loxi9: so like tsyo tsyo would be a good pronunciation
[2:15:32] AzureCatalyst: Cheese without the h sound is actually a good way to explain it
[2:15:48] Krethas: Yeah but it's just kinda hard to understand unless you've heard it
[2:15:52] Loxi9: ye
[2:15:55] fljqpy: just call him pewpew its close enough
[2:16:02] Cuix23: like something between "tzatziki" and "cheese"?
[2:16:03] AzureCatalyst: Yeah mandarin is a fuciing hard language to explain if y ou don't natively spea kit
[2:16:03] trueaether: the Lucian damage in that fight
[2:16:04] trueaether: 5.5k
[2:16:06] fruge2: fights look ok for TT when k'sante ults aphelios

[2:16:09] AzureCatalyst: As a person who speaks fucking bad mandarin
[2:16:10] Loxi9: try pronouncing "ts" but move ur tongue away from ur teeth
[2:16:31] AzureCatalyst: ^
[2:16:32] fljqpy: its the type of sound u make when u do finger guns
[2:16:32] Loxi9: YES
[2:16:33] AzureCatalyst: Ye
[2:16:34] Loxi9: PERFECTLY
[2:16:34] Krethas: Yeah that's way closer
[2:16:35] AzureCatalyst: YOU GOT IT
[2:16:41] AzureCatalyst: That's like 90% of the way therte
[2:16:48] Prepo9: Chinese Lucian mechanics is beautiful
[2:16:58] verylingual: that dude saying Cheese without the H is literally telling you to pronounce a K
[2:17:00] verylingual: lmao
[2:17:03] zionsick: Why there is no caster desk for LPL?
[2:17:12] AzureCatalyst: Watching Chinese Lucian then seeing LEC and LCS lucian is night and day
[2:17:16] dianstyle: this 1xn guy is 19
[2:17:24] fljqpy: desk KEKW
[2:17:27] zionsick: They're streaming from their homes
[2:17:28] AzureCatalyst: No analyst desk or do you mean just no desk in general
[2:17:29] Loxi9: u can tell 1xn has never spoken a word of english in his life
[2:17:31] dianstyle: and he is gapping gala
[2:17:33] Loxi9: by how he plays lucian
[2:17:34] AzureCatalyst: I want to see Shear
[2:17:35] Prepo9: @AzureCatalyst It's literally different champion
[2:17:36] fIuffee: be glad there's even an english broadcast
[2:17:38] zionsick: Not like LCK
[2:17:56] AzureCatalyst: @Prepo9 I watched Upset lucian again and it hurts my eyes
[2:18:26] 2020mazdacx5: smog
[2:18:30] AzureCatalyst: Smog is rough
[2:18:44] najafan: @AzureCatalyst So is political repression.
[2:18:50] AzureCatalyst: Don't gotta convince me
[2:18:51] zionsick: Thanks
[2:18:51] J__Carson: how could u monte 😂
[2:18:55] Im_Rubic: LUL
[2:18:55] azevedao: Is the tgif in the lpl chair some other meaning or what
[2:18:58] deadpoool04: they were in china for summer finals right ?
[2:19:01] PalemoonsFumo: looking at the first games played so early in the season, do you think lpl or lck looking more scary this year (when comparing quality of teams)
[2:19:08] fruge2: wait wtf happened to LEC
[2:19:14] xMik9: wait what who did they fire
[2:19:15] Loxi9: please dont criticize the ccp, they check my internet footprint monkaS
[2:19:15] deadpoool04: summer or spring i dont remember exactly
[2:19:19] najafan: Seriously, how on earth do you have ONE observer?
[2:19:25] hazeturderandere: honestly lec gameplay is so bad id rather watch t1 rekkles
[2:19:25] Ludastian: is there going to be a 4 horseman about the gaming/esports layoffs?
[2:19:36] najafan: ONE observer and you fired your producer.
[2:19:38] rilsolo: yea they’re letting caedral costream from home because of all the firings
[2:19:43] hitmon_gg: BibleThump
[2:19:44] fljqpy: they got kitkat'd
[2:19:44] Mizzzraim: what why LUL
[2:19:48] Warzard908: oh noooo
[2:19:50] fruge2: bro holy shit what
[2:19:52] kapzu44: whaat
[2:19:55] zionsick: holy shit what the fuck
[2:19:57] fIuffee: all really good news
[2:19:58] smithpw: replays LUL
[2:20:00] Loxi9: what if that one observer is just him
[2:20:03] Loxi9: did u consider that?
[2:20:05] Warzard908: monkaW
[2:20:15] fernysilva19: WTF IS RIOT DUMB AF
[2:20:21] fernysilva19: holy
[2:20:24] colorblindgenius: is LEC really that unprofitable?
[2:20:25] hitmon_gg: F
[2:20:25] najafan: Again, teams should play Yorick to protest
[2:20:26] Esterifikace: honestly no replays is a good news with how they were using them most of the time vicksyLUL
[2:20:27] fruge2: small indie game company strikes again
[2:20:28] fIuffee: wait lec is on tomorrow right
[2:20:28] azevedao: vedius back on observing
[2:20:29] kapzu44: this happen this week ?
[2:20:29] fIuffee: good god
[2:20:32] fljqpy: lec is just gonna be a lan party this weekend LUL
[2:20:33] ionlysubtoVP: But, but, mark z told us the caster and analysts would still be there?! Lol wtf
[2:20:33] zionsick: I have an idea: Is gonna be a clusterfuck
[2:20:34] kraethan: Was this in the layoffs or seperate?
[2:20:39] J__Carson: maybe I’ll watch some lec this weekend lol
[2:20:48] najafan: @fruge2 Tencent lost 30% market cap in a year.
[2:20:50] kapzu44: this happen durant this week? ?
[2:20:50] Loxi9: wasnt ender an observer before casting? what if he comes back
[2:20:50] froglok_: @fernysilva19 its not just riot. a handful of companies are doing massive layoffs all over the world.
[2:20:55] Loxi9: Kappa
[2:20:57] Ludastian: it seems like such a crazy time to do it like right after they got started
[2:20:57] Mile1234567890: I am going to die of kit kat break overdose
[2:21:00] Zeroantagonist: here i was thinking LEC was the only "unexpected success story" outside of china too
[2:21:02] fruge2: @fruge2 lmaooooo
[2:21:09] MissingMatter: @froglok_ Yes, "a handful"
[2:21:09] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:21:20] marco90s: gonna be a raw feed of the games LuL
[2:21:22] rfarleydude97: thats super fucked for LEC
[2:21:25] rfarleydude97: Fuck Riot
[2:21:39] ionlysubtoVP: So lcs trying to right sinking ship and lcs is building an iceberg
[2:21:40] najafan: @froglok_ That's actually overstated. Unemployment is incredibly low, especially among prime employment age.
[2:21:44] kraethan: Time for 11 hour broadcasts
[2:21:45] ThatLatvianGuy: imagine being KC, get in lec, go 0-6, and production is in the bin
[2:21:45] Im_Rubic: Thinking higher ups at corporate have any idea of how to do their job LUL
[2:21:48] najafan: This is just Riot being dumb.
[2:21:48] azevedao: Who chose who got laid off?
[2:21:56] kraethan: Just for technical issues
[2:22:04] najafan: Unemployment is like 3%.
[2:22:07] BostromTV: more lec pauses lets gooo
[2:22:09] pesukarhupoju: but how funny would it be if this was the weekend without the lec pause
[2:22:11] najafan: It's just Riot.
[2:22:12] Sniper13x: fired based on salary not realizing salary = worth
[2:22:17] Loxi9: HAHA
[2:22:20] kapzu44: daamn
[2:22:21] Warzard908: huh?
[2:22:25] rfarleydude97: that network was def not coming out LMFAO
[2:22:36] pentalem: Its good it didn't happen because livestreaming loses money lol
[2:22:38] kraethan: They were doing that?
[2:22:39] kapzu44: i can't understand riot man
[2:22:40] rfarleydude97: with the way they handle stuff
[2:22:43] For3verZero: gaming industry is suffering layoffs allover
[2:22:46] Warzard908: PepeHands
[2:22:52] Im_Rubic: Four Horsemen when?
[2:22:52] nipplePICLE: I bet who ever idea was that streaming platform is still working at riot
[2:23:02] rfarleydude97: @Im_Rubic x2
[2:23:09] rfarleydude97: HELL YEAH FOUR HORSEMEN!
[2:23:11] Im_Rubic: SeemsGood
[2:23:13] jgeo_: Let riot burn
[2:23:16] najafan: Again, Tencent lost 30% of market cap in a year. Kinda important context imo.
[2:23:24] ThatLatvianGuy: I take it lec is going to open costreaming floodgates to get some viewers
[2:23:26] Loxi9: right
[2:23:31] zionsick: Why Riot is so successful and so stupid at the same time
[2:23:33] AzureCatalyst: I'm expecting Saudi influence/money onto the LEC productio NGL
[2:23:44] tooeasytoforget: Like watching a hype train crash in slow motion
[2:23:45] Zeroantagonist: i guess they observed the cost cutting potential of costreamers
[2:23:45] fljqpy: how to make LCS better? destroy LEC LUL
[2:23:47] kraethan: Did yall talk about overwatch news anywhere?
[2:23:57] najafan: But Tencent wanting bigger profits might.
[2:24:18] najafan: And they might think this looks good for their investors.
[2:24:45] Zeroantagonist: i'd consider watching LCS if they made it pan-american and there was entertaining NA/BR competition but NA only is zzz for me
[2:24:51] pesukarhupoju: riot games is peanuts to tencent
[2:25:11] DanielFromLA: did monte talk about how theres no announcement of lcs spring finals?
[2:25:14] ThatLatvianGuy: @kraethan richard lewis did, you might want to look at his twitch vods
[2:25:14] Ludastian: there are a lot of streamers in belfast and they say the cost of living there is relatively low
[2:25:15] najafan: @pesukarhupoju Sure, but if you're trying to please investors you do anything.
[2:25:18] kraethan: Yeah looking forward to your takes
[2:25:37] kapzu44: slow game
[2:25:38] Loxi9: ucal corki was kinda Pepega
[2:25:43] najafan: A THOUSAND YEARS OF CORKI AZIR.
[2:25:49] Knightroj: they game them everythimg
[2:26:04] verylingual: why announce spring finals for a minor region KEKW
[2:26:14] kraethan: They announced dates but not location

[2:26:17] colorblindgenius: they fired the twitter guy probably too for LEC LUL man
[2:26:24] Loxi9: @verylingual is that how ur gonna talk about the 3rd best region in the world? :^)
[2:26:33] Warzard908: mark z is supposed to be  announcing that this coming week i believe
[2:26:41] fruge2: i feel like it took them a little while to announce summer finals last year
[2:26:42] mrkatsudonnn: how’s LPL doing? any team to look out for other than BLG
[2:26:54] verylingual: @Loxi9 LMAO
[2:26:55] najafan: Maybe Quickshot will be an observer. Kappa
[2:26:58] a_lonely_observer: Tes
[2:27:04] tranquil54: do they still have casters for LEC? lol
[2:27:15] amaxlegit: NIP
[2:27:38] krokam1: and do 10x job
[2:27:39] mrkatsudonnn: good to see TES.hopefully to see them at worlds
[2:27:42] Loxi9: this will forever be known as the lec kristallnacht Sadge
[2:27:45] tranquil54: thts so messed up
[2:27:50] swordtricksword: monte i love u
[2:27:54] J__Carson: it will interesting if NIP can be good but ever yr a team comes out of know where and are pretty good
[2:27:55] itsame_martin: I thought LEC was the best performing league in terms of numbers so these lay offs baffle me, the talent pool there is insane
[2:27:57] fruge2: starting to make an abundance of sense why Caedral pivoted to streaming
[2:28:18] fIuffee: This is why Riot deserves respect as the GOAT. They don't ever miss and every decision they make is an absolute banger
[2:28:22] kraethan: Would be god tier if a caster blasted them for it, but we all know how that works
[2:28:31] fIuffee: caedral made millions over worlds i bet
[2:28:33] fruge2: oh for sure, dude just runs 10k viewers like it's nothing
[2:28:44] mrkatsudonnn: he stream in LEC studio no? what’s the difference
[2:28:44] jerckysminion: i am here for all of the bangers but plz tell me the LEC stuff is a joke and not real
[2:28:58] jerckysminion: if that's real i hope their whole broadcast gets dumpster fire this weekend
[2:29:08] swordtricksword: @jerckysminion whats the tea sis
[2:29:12] thedeadoctopus: Maybe this is Riot's plan to improve LCS viewership. Ruin english broadcasts for every other region
[2:29:13] zen__cloud: i haven't heard the name ucal in forever
[2:29:16] J__Carson: and he said they were having to do a bunch of meeting throughout the week that took a lot of his time
[2:29:18] najafan: @jerckysminion I want the teams to pick Yorick :)
[2:29:25] fIuffee: go look at monte's twitter if you want to know the lec stuff
[2:29:26] jerckysminion: well kids enjoy LEC burning into a flame this weekend
[2:29:28] DanielFromLA: i mean ludwig showed how much he made his last year on twitch on his last stream. i wonder how much caedral made co streaming worlds last year @MonteCristo
[2:29:49] najafan: Yorick is just a walking bug.
[2:29:51] ThatLatvianGuy: did lcs broadcast get any significant layoffs
[2:29:57] itsame_martin: is this TT overperforming or LNG underperforming?
[2:29:58] fruge2: ^
[2:30:02] fIuffee: Caedrel makes well over $300 a stream
[2:30:03] Sniper13x: lcs makes money
[2:30:06] Zeroantagonist: has there been any response to the LCK letter yet
[2:30:08] tranquil54: monte deserves the millions carried league on his back for so long
[2:30:13] najafan: So choosing him would be fun for their production.
[2:30:15] Warzard908: @itsame_martin both i feel
[2:30:20] fruge2: guess that confirms NA > EU?
[2:30:20] mrkatsudonnn: will you stream until the telecom war?
[2:30:31] Loxi9: yeah
[2:30:34] truthlol: i never understood what they were doing with the dive
[2:30:39] Loxi9: the dive is awful
[2:30:42] SomeFerretGuy: wow you're still live PogUU
[2:30:50] Lamynator: @fruge2 it just confirms that office politicking works and NA gets an advantage being at HQ
[2:31:11] SomeFerretGuy: jlxp > dive
[2:31:12] colorblindgenius: can someone link me montes yt channel (not the vod one)?
[2:31:16] BaDaG1: @MonteCristo who do you favour Team WE or AL?
[2:31:16] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:31:24] SomeFerretGuy: ggmontecristo?
[2:31:25] a_lonely_observer: You can also talk weed on lfn podcasts #freezepipe
[2:31:41] Ligs4prez: It's crazy how a company can fail at a thing for so long
[2:31:49] mrkatsudonnn: no more restrictions
[2:31:57] addaberry: Said HO YA and charged in like the Koolaid Man
[2:31:59] SomeFerretGuy: but can you see why kids love the cinnamon taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
[2:32:04] tranquil54: @MonteCristo bro link your podcasts
[2:32:13] Ludastian: he just played his mini transition too greedy
[2:32:16] DanielFromLA: its like riot is iron 4 while monte is challenger when it comes to how to run a league
[2:32:22] Mizzzraim: hoya redemption arc?
[2:32:26] kraethan: You mean talking about the shit that actually matters! Why would anyone do anything else?
[2:32:29] SomeFerretGuy: !lfn
[2:32:35] direpants2: gotta love how a tank can do that much damage
[2:32:44] TheAnimousVox: he got the plate but at what cost lol
[2:32:47] mrkatsudonnn: greed for one plate. the disrespect
[2:32:54] SomeFerretGuy: hmm maybe I should learn to add a command for lfn
[2:32:54] Sniper13x: how does a gnar lose 1v1?
[2:32:56] Loxi9: @direpants2 hes balanced by the fact that he has 4 dashes as well
[2:33:08] fIuffee: you'll never hear about prostate milking on the dive but monte and thorin COULD talk about it on summoning insight
[2:33:11] truthlol: im sure we will hear about big layoffs at lcs if they even have anyone working production anymore lol. seems like gaming industry is on fire
[2:33:11] mrkatsudonnn: HOYA BACK TO BRO
[2:33:11] Ludastian: he hit every spell too
[2:33:16] DanielFromLA: he used his ult the right way that time lmao
[2:33:25] ThatLatvianGuy: telecom wars in an hour, how hype are we? Kappa
[2:33:31] direpants2: @Loxi9 not a single damage item in his inventory and he can do that KEKW
[2:33:36] Tpro83: Hey Monte, just saw your tweet on the LEC. Holy crap, how does that happen?
[2:33:37] thedeadoctopus: Riot fired their lore writers while in early production for an MMO and fired their LEC production as viewership is increasing. Luckily the sexual predators that cost Riot 100m is settlement fees still have their jobs
[2:33:42] tarlionz: is the competitive scenario of  league of legends going to die?
[2:33:51] najafan: @fIuffee tbf, you also won't hear about Thorin's cringe Jordan Peterson love on The Dive.
[2:33:58] najafan: So, mixed bags.
[2:34:06] najafan: Some good some bad.
[2:34:09] SomeFerretGuy: !addcommand !lfn Check out the LFN youtube at https://www.youtube.com/@lastfreenation
[2:34:13] Loxi9: @direpants2 dont forget he never has to go tenacity because he has unstoppable on a  basic ability :)
[2:34:13] fIuffee: najafan Stare
[2:34:15] TheFistification: @najafan some ugly?
[2:34:22] SomeFerretGuy: nuts what use is a sword if I can't add an lfn command
[2:34:33] pesukarhupoju: ngl i have listened to 100 episodes of SI and not once have i heard thorin talk about jp
[2:34:33] najafan: @TheFistification True, MarkZ is on the Dive.
[2:34:43] kraethan: I think is addcom
[2:34:47] J__Carson: monte how many yrs before they combine the americas
[2:34:56] ThatLatvianGuy: @SomeFerretGuy we're janitors FeelsStrongMan
[2:34:58] SomeFerretGuy: I googled moobot's docs
[2:35:01] Loxi9: well sucking is ur brand mr korean fellation enthusiast @MonteCristo
[2:35:02] Warzard908: @najafan not anymore
[2:35:03] fIuffee: Soon it'll cost $25k per monte stream to produce
[2:35:04] itsame_martin: i really did think that LEC and LCS was doing relatively well for themselves so far but i guess it aint enough
[2:35:04] zengendog: maybe karmine corp fans just couldn't handle it anymore and decided to end lec
[2:35:10] jerckysminion: a sword means nothing ! pirates use guns !
[2:35:16] bbqftw_: you know what these leagues could use, some shady gambling/crypto sponsors
[2:35:32] colorblindgenius: i still think lec is doing fine but we will see
[2:35:32] povsisyphus: what time is it in korea rn
[2:35:35] fIuffee: do casters usually not have game audio?
[2:35:41] Zeroantagonist: which esport does the best job with financial sustainability anyway? if any
[2:35:42] fIuffee: or is it the lpl special
[2:35:43] direpants2: @bbqftw_ FTX to the rescue...oh wait
[2:35:57] SomeFerretGuy: @SomeFerretGuy as long as you don't ask me to clean up the puke in aisle 4
[2:36:02] kraethan: Why is league always the corki/azir infinite circle
[2:36:03] fIuffee: oh korea is only 4 hours behind me
[2:36:04] colorblindgenius: @Zeroantagonist probably Dota but lately every esports is going through some stages

[2:36:25] mrkatsudonnn: will you watch telecom war?
[2:36:27] itsame_martin: did you hear about that bloomberg report on riot cancelling their twitch rival network?
[2:36:30] ThatLatvianGuy: i wonder if they still cast off a scuffed 360p zoom stream
[2:36:30] Zeroantagonist: @colorblindgenius crowdfunding prize pool diff? idk much about dota
[2:36:32] najafan: @kraethan Poke vs Disengage/Teamfight, I guess?
[2:36:33] Tpro83: He's screaming WILSON!!
[2:36:39] fIuffee: yes absolutely
[2:36:44] bbqftw_: i mean even dota's TI prize pool massively decreased in recent years
[2:36:45] najafan: @itsame_martin Yeah, talked about like 10 min ago
[2:36:54] itsame_martin: @itsame_martin oop
[2:36:55] colorblindgenius: @Zeroantagonist dota has tons of tournaments including in saudi arabi with multi million price pool like its nothing
[2:37:04] truthlol: i forgot they even had said they were gonna do that
[2:37:18] bbqftw_: its basically saudi + crypto + gambling sponsors there though
[2:37:24] Loxi9: wasnt that one of the things that john needham promised in that interview he did with travis
[2:37:30] ThatLatvianGuy: FeelsStrongMan new future
[2:37:31] Loxi9: that and digital goods
[2:37:38] Zeroantagonist: i see
[2:37:53] najafan: @Loxi9 Oh, nice, NFTs.
[2:37:57] SomeFerretGuy: I have never heard the phrase linear television before
[2:37:59] najafan: We're doing that now too?
[2:38:12] Loxi9: @najafan no more like team skins
[2:38:17] Loxi9: but he basically lied
[2:38:20] najafan: @SomeFerretGuy We're doing a House of Leaves TV show, I guess.
[2:38:23] pesukarhupoju: yeah love me some exponential television
[2:38:25] Mizzzraim: what game might that have been Kappa
[2:38:27] ThatLatvianGuy: najafan lck got nft fyi
[2:38:33] itsame_martin: it feels like riot got over ambitious during covid with their "biggest budget yet" and now the employees are taking the hit
[2:39:04] dharh: yeah easy, I would have subbed back in the day
[2:39:09] fIuffee: really glad they trashed the ogn model for no reason
[2:39:11] zen__cloud: even ESL and faceit have sub buttons don't they?
[2:39:12] tooeasytoforget: I still remember subbing to LCK on Twitch
[2:39:20] Loxi9: riot even got mad at streamers for doing sub only league streams
[2:39:22] LuxtheGod: cant really see the yellow on white
[2:39:26] Lamynator: You think Netflix could explore deals with esports now that they've shown an interest in live sports-based products?  CSGO seems more likely there
[2:39:33] Gsdeppii: @tooeasytoforget same
[2:39:45] jerckysminion: i just want OGN funcionality, the high quality stuff goes into sub only stuff dumb ass riot not even knowing that OGN had about 24k subscribers just for LCK at the time
[2:39:47] Loxi9: shooting themselves intheir foot so often they're walking on swiss cheese at this point
[2:39:55] jerckysminion: for the higher level vods it was good money
[2:39:57] SomeFerretGuy: highly valuable audience?
[2:40:03] SomeFerretGuy: esports fans are dogshit tho

[2:40:43] SomeFerretGuy: Mike Ybarra left
[2:40:46] jerckysminion: more incoming from other software & tech company's
[2:40:48] SomeFerretGuy: D:
[2:40:49] Loxi9: event passes are in no way connected to watching lolesports, btw u can advance passes just from playing the game
[2:40:57] ThatLatvianGuy: monkaHmm
[2:41:06] studboy68: we already watched gen vs bro?
[2:41:10] tooeasytoforget: Fuck yeah I love getting 170 Orange Essence every other time I see a pentakill

[2:41:44] rfarleydude97: LMAOOOOOOO
[2:41:45] bbqftw_: promote placing degenerate parlay bets on esports, its the future
[2:41:46] Gsdeppii: I would buy this
[2:41:49] rfarleydude97: Classic Riot
[2:41:55] kraethan: So they cancelled the one good idea
[2:42:00] rfarleydude97: Complains about something but is the exact reason the problem exists
[2:42:09] itsame_martin: special chat sounds pretty sick
[2:42:12] rfarleydude97: those Team Packs wouldve been super good for team revenue
[2:42:17] Sjkaev: wait cancelled? wtf its such a good idea
[2:42:25] SexyFlask: How would they know what i watch? That means they have to read and keep my data. Im pretty sure thats gonna be a roblem in Europe(meaning the EU)
[2:42:32] deadpoool04: LUL
[2:42:37] sushioball: RIOT
[2:42:43] ThatLatvianGuy: @SexyFlask cookies
[2:42:47] dharh: did they bite off more than they could chew, pure incompetency? or was it just going to be a loss anyway?
[2:42:50] ThatLatvianGuy: you accept them
[2:42:55] Loxi9: @SexyFlask well its cross promotion through their own platform and client
[2:43:00] SexyFlask: @ThatLatvianGuy I can just not accept those ?
[2:43:03] direpants2: that's insane targeted marketing and should work
[2:43:09] SomeFerretGuy: fuck yea emotes
[2:43:09] Warzard908: @dharh imo all of the above
[2:43:17] ThatLatvianGuy: SexyFlask don't get to watch then :)
[2:43:18] froglok_: @SexyFlask then you don't get the promo?
[2:43:19] fIuffee: If only they didn't have to pay those women ( 🤮 ) all that settlement money for sexual harassment 😔
[2:43:40] SomeFerretGuy: @fIuffee can't a man just fart on another man in peace jeez
[2:43:54] SexyFlask: @ThatLatvianGuy Yeah i know, just pointing, that is a problem im pretty sure they havent thought about. Because f.e. German laws are very very strict about that and it will generate problems
[2:43:56] najafan: AND THEY COULD TARGET THEM BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS
[2:44:09] a_lonely_observer: Are you gonna do a 4 horseman episode on this? Thorin says he no longer accepts summoning via Twitter.
[2:44:22] Prepo9: Why did they cancel this? Too costly? It sounds like a pretty good thing
[2:44:33] SomeFerretGuy: LuL
[2:44:47] itsame_martin: yeah seems like a reasonable investment to sustainability
[2:44:50] najafan: They could show beer ads to people they know are >21!
[2:44:50] jerckysminion: we pray for the massive dumpster fire that broadcast goes to shit massively
[2:44:56] jerckysminion: hopefully they resolve nothing
[2:44:57] najafan: Which they can't do otherwise!
[2:45:01] jerckysminion: riot are garbage tier
[2:45:05] xoceozcar: why is everything on fire at LEC i missed it? @MonteCristo
[2:45:08] Lamynator: why would that sort of feature take years to develop..
[2:45:08] ThatLatvianGuy: kc 0-9 is perfect for the peak dumpsterfire
[2:45:09] dharh: @Warzard908 seems like it, as a programmer, it seems a tall task, but coulda been done
[2:45:29] marco90s: but would the sponsor pay the same price advertesing on their streaming platform as much as on twitch/yt
[2:45:29] jerckysminion: @xoceozcar they fired many people integral to the broadcast go check monte's twitter for more info
[2:45:31] MissingMatter: @xoceozcar They fired a bunch of the production and support staff.
[2:45:37] Sjkaev: that is just soooo much time wasted
[2:45:39] zionsick: Not even an MVP
[2:45:47] Amosdragon: Even the pretty cool indie games are no more.
[2:45:50] zionsick: or beta testing

[2:52:35] najafan: @2020mazdacx5 Zoroastrianism is pretty cool, yeah
[2:52:54] zionsick: Someone should make another LoL clone like Palworld did to Pokemon lol
[2:53:00] Sjkaev: @MonteCristo really just want to jump forward into the future just to see/hear about shady post nda stuff behind baffling decisions that riot makes

[2:53:03] 2020mazdacx5: nice, naja
[2:53:05] toxicgamesonly: Question... Where is the best places to go for amateur leagues/tourneys?
[2:53:07] AzureCatalyst: @zionsick You missed the Pokemon Arena game
[2:53:20] a_lonely_observer: @zionsick its called dota/hots
[2:53:22] AzureCatalyst: @zionsick My favorite part was watching Froskurrin lose her mind over pikachus
[2:53:31] commando1814: teams need win songs like how the nhl has goal songs
[2:53:37] Sjkaev: ALO
[2:53:39] fljqpy: isnt there already a mobile clone of LOL
[2:53:40] zionsick: @AzureCatalyst Dota was before LoL
[2:53:41] LeGrandMister: Kia and Hunday's have been seeling cars fos
[2:53:51] fIuffee: why did the casters break the stream like that?
[2:53:54] fIuffee: not cool
[2:53:58] zionsick: hots was always shit tbh
[2:54:10] AzureCatalyst: @zionsick You replied to the wrong person I know Dota is before lol which is why I recommended Pokemon Arena which came out after LoL

[2:54:40] thedeadoctopus: 3rd game was a banger
[2:54:41] Professional_Aellith: HotS was great to play casually, but it was a rough competitively
[2:54:41] mrkatsudonnn: imagine KUA sponsor on herald
[2:54:45] 2020mazdacx5: feels like driving herald is kind of bait, usually puts you in a bad position strategically
[2:54:49] sandking36: dw 3rd game delivers
[2:54:50] EvanLPL: I remember game 1 being the best
[2:54:53] najafan: @AzureCatalyst Technically our empirical observations of the universe are broadly compatible with the Godel Metric. So, uh, "nuh uh".
[2:54:56] Loxi9: @mrkatsudonnn that would be perfect
[2:54:57] Sjkaev: is this just another slow dry defeat by lng
[2:55:00] a_lonely_observer: Honestly it's time for moba games to die
[2:55:02] direpants2: what a snipe
[2:55:06] MissingMatter: Ever wonder what clown at Blizzard decided to name Heroes of the Storm and Heart of the Swarm with the same initials?
[2:55:11] mrkatsudonnn: insane marketing strategy
[2:55:20] IrishProphet: monte missed the snipe
[2:55:22] sl1200mk5: lots of Extremely Starbucks Cxmmunists in that thread  ah well. f for the good ppls from  the lec production
[2:55:22] AzureCatalyst: @najafan But then we have the reverse law of the Godel Metric which is "uh huh"
[2:55:25] fatalqwerty: @a_lonely_observer yeah bring back RTS, give us back our time in the light
[2:55:34] zionsick: Well, Microsoft fired a shiton of people from Blizzard
[2:55:36] Prepo9: Very tame for being a LPL series
[2:55:37] Sjkaev: oh they lose? huh
[2:55:45] fljqpy: its just wings of liberty
[2:55:46] zionsick: So probably thats good news for the company somehow>
[2:56:04] colorblindgenius: the only companies that did not do layoffs are banks...
[2:56:14] zionsick: @colorblindgenius Yet*
[2:56:15] froglok_: @zionsick was people from a handful of their acquisitions, not just blizzard
[2:56:17] najafan: @AzureCatalyst (The Godel Metric is a solution to Einstein's Field Equations which is a universe with closed time-like curves. AKA, time travel.)
[2:56:18] a_lonely_observer: @missingmatter heart of the swarm is not called hots, its called PROTOSSED
[2:56:33] Loxi9: 2 banks went caput just recently?
[2:56:33] colorblindgenius: @zionsick where im from the banking sector hired 14k ppl over last few months
[2:56:56] Elias_zxy: doesn anyone know where the PCS plays their matches?, i mean location, do they have a studio anywhere?

[2:57:11] zionsick: I'm SWE and got axed in May 2023 the industry is fucked right now
[2:57:22] fatalqwerty: malignance manamune harass is just disgusting
[2:57:35] sl1200mk5: @colorblindgenius gl come march, brohammer. will be some pain come march once a bunch of liquidity dries up. not the large orgs, but regional banks
[2:57:36] fruge2: LNG look like 5 solo q players
[2:57:41] Double_Hitt: game 3 is the banger tbf
[2:57:43] AzureCatalyst: @AzureCatalyst The Nuh Uh hypothesis is also reversed by the Uh Huh or Yuh huh which is also further proof of the "I know you are but what am I" tactic pioneered by 12 years olds in the recess fields
[2:57:47] a_lonely_observer: They lost because beichuan match fixing
[2:57:57] mrkatsudonnn: how did TT lose???
[2:58:02] a_lonely_observer: It was basically a 3-0
[2:58:03] Sjkaev: must've been one big blunder at the end somehow
[2:58:04] najafan: Guys, unemployment is like 3%. Things are broadly very good. Yes, people get fired and every particular instance is bad.
[2:58:13] najafan: But the economy as a whole is really good right now.
[2:58:22] Loxi9: hes waving at them
[2:58:25] najafan: Really really good.
[2:58:32] zionsick: @najafan I mean its good overall but SWE is fucked right now
[2:58:35] fatalqwerty: distribution of money is ass tho
[2:58:36] AzureCatalyst: Economy being good as a whole right now but that doesn't typically affect the common worker or common wages tbh
[2:58:36] fljqpy: unless youre fired, then sucks to be you
[2:58:45] Manjiji: As someone that used to play Nami a lot, I die a little inside when I see pros play her.
[2:59:07] SnowKayn: Constellation Prize lmao this caster
[2:59:08] AzureCatalyst: Thorin ranting aobut people using Nami ulti to engage instead of disengage is my fucking spirit animal
[2:59:11] a_lonely_observer: The issue with unemployment is that it doesn't show the type of employment, the job market is ass if you have a producer/director working as a uber driver
[2:59:11] najafan: @AzureCatalyst In the US the lowest quartile of wages have gone up over the last year, while the top two have gone down.
[2:59:38] najafan: The poorest people have had the BEST wage growth in the last year.
[2:59:42] zcdcd: LPL letsgo
[2:59:54] fatalqwerty: we need to compare that to the current level of standards of living, it's easy to say wages have gone up in a vacuum tbh
[3:00:04] najafan: Yes, I'm including that.
[3:00:12] zionsick: I wonder when is corki's Malice will get hotfixed
[3:00:14] najafan: They've outpaced inflation.
[3:00:17] fljqpy: back to service jobs letsgo
[3:00:25] Irollex: have you talked about the whole udyr twitter argument?
[3:00:26] Loxi9: mid is open
[3:00:30] fatalqwerty: in the long run?
[3:00:42] Warzard908: throw at soul
[3:00:47] Sjkaev: it has to be some weird dragon fight LUL
[3:00:48] Warzard908: my guess
[3:00:57] fljqpy: same gold
[3:00:58] najafan: Nah, just in the last year. We had to bounce back from the pandemic, that was rough.
[3:00:58] Clyde1500: we always play doa's favorite game of "Is it throwable?" FeelsBadMan
[3:01:04] Loxi9: ucal: 4 chinese cant win
[3:01:04] zionsick: @a_lonely_observer Does uber/doordash counts towards employment?
[3:01:09] najafan: The last year was good.
[3:01:13] cenet1: @najafan id like a hit of whatever ur smoking my man
[3:01:13] fatalqwerty: oof that rocket was DansGame
[3:01:17] zionsick: Genuinely asking
[3:01:26] AnonymousNihilist: zven?
[3:01:35] najafan: @zionsick I don't believe so, you can check the methodology FRED uses.
[3:01:37] fljqpy: uber would be self employed right
[3:01:43] najafan: @cenet1 FRED data is very robust.
[3:01:54] fljqpy: like contractors
[3:01:54] cenet1: sure bud
[3:02:03] brandofan2: only two towers with that baron and how strong ucal was is kind of bad
[3:02:03] dharh: off to bed
[3:02:04] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:02:53] zionsick: was that flash necessary?
[3:03:01] AvariceTrades: Did you watch beryl on ornn?
[3:03:16] fljqpy: crypto bloom letsgo
[3:03:24] Kopro11tv: Monte going viral on reddit. Everyone talking about the layoffs now.
[3:03:34] Sjkaev: wth do they have the need to walk at that corner LUL
[3:03:41] AzureCatalyst: Wait really?
[3:03:44] Loxi9: tf is ucal doing there
[3:03:46] fljqpy: ucal with the int
[3:03:50] AzureCatalyst: Did reddit not shadowbann Monte and al the LFN stuff
[3:03:52] brandofan2: ucal wanted an angle for package but just kind of int walked
[3:04:09] Prepo9: It's like both teams just agreed that it's time to fight
[3:04:28] brandofan2: if ucal is near raptor side of the lane instead they win that fight so hard
[3:04:30] fljqpy: yea why not walk around
[3:04:38] fljqpy: u go zoomzoom with the package
[3:04:49] najafan: @zionsick Ah, checked. The 3% does consider Uber, etc, to be working, but if we include them it only goes up to 4.6%.
[3:04:51] Prepo9: Im surprised WeiWei didnt flash engage there
[3:05:29] zionsick: @najafan Thanks
[3:05:37] a_lonely_observer: @azurecatalyst i see summoning insight and powers like on there occasionally but not 4 horseman because of voldemort
[3:05:53] Zachary_Blobman: twitch - eclipse malignance
[3:05:59] balance_cs: Flash rell ult was open as well
[3:06:28] ThatLatvianGuy: @AzureCatalyst just downvoted to hell most of the time these days
[3:06:40] fljqpy: ???
[3:06:47] najafan: @zionsick The MOST extreme version, which includes people who are also underemployed for economic reasons as well (eg, they don't have a full time job because if they do they lose benefits, which is a weird thing that happens) is 7.1%.
[3:06:47] fljqpy: beichuan why
[3:06:50] brandofan2: TT have wasted how strong Ucal was in the midgame
[3:07:15] LuxtheGod: TT playing this about as well as my aram teams

[3:08:36] 不知名看客: I'm so disappointed in Li Ning.
[3:08:50] fljqpy: ??? jesus
[3:08:55] brandofan2: quite the grief lol
[3:09:05] Sjkaev: NotLikeThis
[3:09:06] fljqpy: does he think hes azir LUL
[3:09:13] LuxtheGod: i've played with people with better game knowledge in aram
[3:09:16] Sjkaev: they just lost to tthemselves LUL
[3:09:31] najafan: Not the package
[3:09:36] 不知名看客: The third game was the best.
[3:09:46] Sjkaev: mm more brand
[3:10:03] Clyde1500: Is brand a good first pick?
[3:10:07] a_lonely_observer: Ur not gonna enjoy watching this brand LUL
[3:10:10] fljqpy: brand jg clear Kreygasm
[3:10:21] itzschwi: how do you think lec will run today
[3:10:53] ThatLatvianGuy: lec is not on today fyi
[3:10:56] brandofan2: if you were an udyr in this game would you go first item frozen heart, hoya thinks differently
[3:11:00] thedeadoctopus: LEC is tomorrow
[3:11:01] Sjkaev: ill just be happy if they have something LUL
[3:11:02] Clyde1500: they definitely kept the most experienced guy to run LEC
[3:11:02] Red_Mattr: There's like no observers left. Effeiz going to die today

[3:11:06] AnonymousNihilist: what happened to lec?
[3:11:08] Nymaera_: hey hey
[3:11:14] friskybusinesses: this game was hype, but still gave me multiple aneurysms
[3:11:15] MitsuyoMaeda: what Happened to lec?
[3:11:15] balance_cs: Every Lucian game I've seen so far pretty much ends up with the Lucian not winning lane early and then getting outscaled by Aphelios
[3:11:29] Warzard908: @MitsuyoMaeda lot of staff fired
[3:11:35] Nymaera_: the Corki game was
[3:11:40] Nymaera_: it was a game of league of legends
[3:11:46] pitzigoy13: xD
[3:11:49] friskybusinesses: LNG shit the bed in both games so so hard
[3:11:56] najafan: @balance_cs They just need to use the lvl 2 powerspike
[3:11:59] Loxi9: @nymaera_ ur in a safe space
[3:12:08] Nymaera_: also Ucal just didn’t hit skillshots
[3:12:18] Nymaera_: loads of times he just didn’t get poke value

[3:12:32] Nymaera_: this game almost broke me too lol
[3:12:57] thedeadoctopus: This game is a banger
[3:13:05] rfarleydude97: Ive seen DH, First Strike and Elec on Brand, wth is even the right one for Brand JG??
[3:13:10] Loxi9: i dont remember how they win this game
[3:13:16] friskybusinesses: @Nymaera_ i do the recording for this game on leagueapedia, i had LNG winning ready to be put in and then it all fell apart
[3:13:23] Loxi9: beichuans brand was not exactly the best
[3:13:26] brandofan2: little fiesta
[3:14:06] najafan: @friskybusinesses Oh, you're with LP? Do y'all use SMW?
[3:14:06] Warzard908: 4 summs for 1 kill
[3:14:18] thedeadoctopus: @Warzard908 well for 1 kill and 2 sums
[3:14:25] a_lonely_observer: Gala absolutely exposed this series
[3:14:35] najafan: River was helpful with one of our admins building a SMW template on the Doctor Who wiki.
[3:14:41] friskybusinesses: @najafan wat dat, super mario world
[3:14:51] najafan: Semantic Media Wiki
[3:15:13] ThatLatvianGuy: gala just suffering, why is hang on the bench again
[3:15:20] Astrotaur: Hello Monte, just passing by to see how you're doing
[3:15:24] friskybusinesses: @najafan nah were connected with fandom
[3:15:31] najafan: So are we.
[3:15:40] najafan: SMW is an extension.
[3:15:42] balance_cs: I'm excited to see what other new champs come out of this season when the pros figure more things out. Jungle Brand and Support Orn are fun to watch
[3:15:59] a_lonely_observer: Jackeylove made him look better than he is, like every support he plays with
[3:16:01] friskybusinesses: i wouldnt know then
[3:16:03] najafan: There are only a handful of fandom wikis that have it, and they refuse to hand it out to any others because it's so messy.
[3:16:09] Warzard908: Can't wait to see if we get Ivern
[3:16:18] Professional_Aellith: Why does Rell see so much pro play as a jungler? I’ve only seen a limited number of matches with her but they’ve always been underwhelming performances.
[3:16:27] Zeroantagonist: KT brought out the ivern right
[3:16:33] Zeroantagonist: big fan of the new KT very entertaining to watch
[3:16:44] Astrotaur: Hmisay low economy junglers are liked a lot in pro play
[3:17:27] thedeadoctopus: I wonder if any LEC tops looked up how to play Udyr in prep for week 3

[3:17:42] balance_cs: @Zeroantagonist You like watching new KT int into KDF? I mean I do cause I'm a KDF fan, but I didn't think others would be having fun
[3:18:08] Loxi9: we found the only kdf fan in existence
[3:18:13] AnonymousNihilist: KDF makes 4th seed this year I hope
[3:18:14] Loxi9: like finding a rare pokemon
[3:18:18] Warzard908: being a LCK/LPL fan on the east coast kinda sucks
[3:18:23] AnonymousNihilist: I'm also kdf fan for 2 years

[3:18:57] fruge2: how tf did TT win this game but lose last game
[3:18:59] balance_cs: Yeah it's a tough life, but now that Taeyoon is out things are looking up
[3:19:19] AnonymousNihilist: yeah just need bullgod to play like normal
[3:19:22] Loxi9: would u say
[3:19:27] Loxi9: kdf is looking bullish
[3:19:29] grandezelx: I mean the best lucian nami in the world is probably t1 it makes sense why they are the only one playing blood song.
[3:19:30] Warzard908: he doesn't have enough damage yet so yea
[3:19:32] wiisoka: @balance_cs taeyoon has to play against T1 and GEN in week 1, then Bull gets the easy match with KT inting and now took his spot
[3:19:54] a_lonely_observer: Dom giga triggered by all the udyr players LUL

[3:20:13] AnonymousNihilist: no
[3:20:16] Zeroantagonist: @Warzard908 i gotchu ***
[3:20:28] balance_cs: Yeah but regardless of who Taeyoon played his play was dogshit and has been since last season. He dies so many times a game. Just throws fights for his team, or gets caught out by himself
[3:20:32] King_Turnethin: nevermind wrong team lmao
[3:20:40] Warzard908: @King_Turnethin no?
[3:21:39] AnonymousNihilist: yeah Bull already looks solid, if he keeps improving this year KDF has a shot in summer

[3:23:49] Mizzzraim: @Loxi9 they did that well last year too but against decent teams not so much
[3:24:09] Loxi9: yeah
[3:24:24] Loxi9: they look just as lost on the map this year

[3:28:44] fruge2: hots is bugless bc there's 0 devs left
[3:28:45] brandofan2: Dom def had some words on the udyr gameplay
[3:28:48] Loxi9: i would rather play a fun game than play a polished one
[3:28:56] Zeroantagonist: i read that udyr is also fairly safe for blind pick for a top laner but i may be wrong (i only play mid/botlane and dk much about top, just parroting what others said)
[3:29:04] IRageU78: LS said it should be liandrys udyr

[3:36:02] Amosdragon: I am very confused how LNG managed to lose that game.
[3:36:03] miniath_: maybe dont randomly forget to show up to dragon
[3:36:08] miniath_: thats pretty hard right
[3:36:25] friskybusinesses: they have you vote for the mvp for LNG LOL
[3:36:28] Vailyon: Is this like summer break from school and you need a refresher on what you learned last year?
[3:36:28] Mizzzraim: xdd
[3:36:31] AzureCatalyst: WeiHe was tryting to q combo
[3:36:35] AzureCatalyst: But he missed the q looks like
[3:36:43] Prepo9: I think he thought that the Lee Q landed
[3:36:51] AzureCatalyst: It looked like they wre trying to combo Q smite with Varus Arrow and lee sin Q smite execute
[3:37:03] tsukiyo_midnight: could also be predicting them to burst + smite it
[3:37:13] AzureCatalyst: No you see the varus q
[3:37:14] Mizzzraim: i was wondering the same thing
[3:37:22] AzureCatalyst: charged through so it's just a mechanical misplay
[3:37:26] miniath_: ok they brake inhb towers
[3:37:48] ThatLatvianGuy: 3/2 split too advanced for now

[3:39:33] direpants2: It's like a normal solo queue experience
[3:39:46] Sniper13x: udyr moves really fast its easy to miss on him
[3:39:55] miniath_: so they just used half their ults to save scout 15 seconds before dragon
[3:40:04] AzureCatalyst: They missed chains of corruption too
[3:40:07] AzureCatalyst: Scout is just to ofar up
[3:40:08] Mizzzraim: panic r?
[3:40:12] AzureCatalyst: And hoya just ghosts at him
[3:40:22] DreamRL_: Hoya just sees Scout on his screen and hits ghost

[3:42:22] ThatLatvianGuy: @AzureCatalyst was it missing?
[3:42:25] AzureCatalyst: If they just aggressively use renata ulti they can sit in the pit and just burst with weiwei
[3:42:29] SingedLFT17: he combod it well with q e w smite
[3:42:33] balance_cs: Zika could have flashed onto trist and just bought time for his team to take baron and run
[3:42:36] AzureCatalyst: @ThatLatvianGuy Nah they were Marking Keepo
[3:42:39] rilsolo: man those varus ults arent it
