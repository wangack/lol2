[4:16:51] GlacialEmbrace: the talent
[4:17:04] Kinkou_Order: how unhealthy is sleeping for 4 hours 2 times a day instead of 8 1 time?
[4:17:47] Balldropper: o no another viego game
[4:17:53] Luis9Ds: @WholesomeHyena_ my opinion, I would be tired all day
[4:17:56] LotusParadiseBird: @WholesomeHyena_ It's good as long as the schedule is consistent
[4:17:56] Senyuno: Not that unhealthy. As long as you get REM and go through full cycles
[4:18:07] bladetrinity16: darshan is wholesome

[4:18:24] savor_the_flavor: as long as rems are hit and the sleep pattern is managable i dont see any downsides
[4:18:27] zerpentinefire: Would you go swifties or other boots on Senna? Or just depending on situation?
[4:18:39] unseated9: @WholesomeHyena_ apparently thats the more natural cycle in some study but dont quote me on that, it's just society is built on 8hr 1 time
[4:19:11] Kinkou_Order: @WholesomeHyena_ makes sense then bc i dont "sleep" i just go to bed when tired and wake up when not tired
[4:19:39] JadeKatt: wait what sera skin is that omg
[4:19:47] zerpentinefire: Oh, thanks! :D
[4:19:49] MrKafay: I don't see a lot of supp taking mobilities nowadays
[4:19:53] Senyuno: Kinda true history shows farmers would be awake at night before dawn and the Spanish have had siestas for a millennia
[4:19:58] Luis9Ds: I do that, but my "tired" means at least 10 hours sleeping
[4:20:29] Kinkou_Order: @Luis9Ds pekinPEKW used to be that way before my meds
