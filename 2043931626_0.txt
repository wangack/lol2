[2:57:59] crusherr73: !yone
[2:58:00] Nightbot: dont E when he has Q3 he will dash over it. Try to use A click when he uses E.
[2:58:02] chipsohoy64: Do you not go that one item that heals you with your Q's?
[2:58:07] okaymangoXD: dleikmParty dleikmParty dleikmParty dleikmParty
[2:58:23] Blu_Blu: !kindred
[2:58:30] KingParanha: @chipsohoy64 hes going for raw 1v1
[2:58:33] CosmicTurtle2788: !volibear
[2:58:33] Nightbot: ult his ult. Dont trade with him just run and outscale
[2:58:39] suyashmedhavi: not selling doran?
[2:58:52] chipsohoy64: @KingParanha Yeah that's a 1 vs 1 item. That item is like divine for trundle
[2:59:12] cupoftea1111: he builds sundered sky a fair bit
[2:59:14] KingParanha: @chipsohoy64 its not as good as divine, the items he has dont have any health, because they are raw damage
[2:59:25] cupoftea1111: he has multiple forms of heal, probably not needed now
[2:59:26] fangs_lol: !fizz
[2:59:49] KingParanha: also trundle needs waveclear, so tiamat item first is a must
[2:59:51] fangs_lol: cuz he gets sht on by fizz he knows
[3:00:08] KingParanha: @yamertallahseversen both are important, you need a mix of both
[3:00:20] chipsohoy64: @KingParanha Its bizarre to me to not have at least one hp item tho. Especially when one really good one exists.
[3:00:28] cupoftea1111: most items have a mixture of health and resistances anyway
[3:00:47] KingParanha: @chipsohoy64 ravenous, and bork are way more important for the 1v1
[3:00:48] Skeith71: avengers lol
[3:00:48] d3f1r3: damn bro got gang banged
[3:00:58] SxualPenguin: lmao, enemy team fought that like you were a raid boss

[3:03:56] cupoftea1111: cooldowns riven?
[3:03:59] chipsohoy64: Hm. I'd think Brusier it Tri/Titanic/sterkas, whereas the 1 v 1 build is bork/hydra/and the Sunderer item
