[0:03:15] oblivionceltics: can u grind ur pokemon and stuff or nah
[0:03:23] oblivionceltics: to level it up
[0:03:33] tobyteemo: in pokemon world they sometimes use stuff like slugma, fire slug, to heat up the house etc so palworld is closer to pokemon world than pokemon games is KEKW
[0:04:02] oblivionceltics: is it identical pokemons tho or ones they made up themselves
[0:05:20] oblivionceltics: are lobbies ran by like asians and shit
[0:07:32] Waldmonk: Good Morning Mr iPav sgahriHey
[0:08:47] tobyteemo: ipavNom
[0:09:00] tobyteemo: ipav do u coach players for price? on lol
[0:09:34] tobyteemo: it would be good content watch u coach the noobs
[0:09:45] tobyteemo: like neace KEKW
[0:10:05] tobyteemo: neace has no patience either, he turns into drill sergeant
[0:10:08] tobyteemo: it's so fun to watch
[0:10:28] tobyteemo: LS too
[0:10:33] tobyteemo: back in the day LS did those coachings
[0:11:40] tobyteemo: i agree so much free content and the game solves itself too when play
[0:12:05] hentai_yordle: but most people dont know their mistakes and not analyze them correctly
[0:14:03] tobyteemo: true
[0:14:41] Waldmonk: How do you think about the Dark Souls series?
[0:17:50] hentai_yordle: people in low elo make MAJOR mistakes they are not even aware of, spotting them and telling them what they can do better there would give them high increase in % WR
[0:19:18] tobyteemo: sometimes they cant solve it themselves tho
[0:19:33] tobyteemo: yea
[0:19:43] tobyteemo: i had to review a lot to solve
[0:19:51] tobyteemo: by myself
[0:20:37] hentai_yordle: look very simple, I am a teemo main and I know for a face if you analyze my game or when i play live you will find many mistakes I can improve.. that I did not even see
[0:22:17] tobyteemo: i think most ppl buy coaching just to talk to streamer
[0:22:27] tobyteemo: i like to watch ppl get screamed at ipavKEK
[0:22:55] hentai_yordle: I think you are a very analytical teemo player and could have a very good approach to coach people and really help them
[0:27:43] Waldmonk: I just like your Voice :D
[0:30:38] t6ea: Do you speak anyother languages? I think i asked this before But i dont remember
[0:31:11] Waldmonk: @t6ea he just started learning chinese and spanish
[0:31:29] ehreveilletoi: If it can reassure you it's the same even for streamer who are really positive
[0:31:35] t6ea: oh ok thank you @Waldmonk

[1:41:47] shengdeluo: Go straight
[1:43:41] shengdeluo: Having crazy flashbacks to studying in china
[1:43:59] shengdeluo: Grammar is so easy in Chinese
[1:44:16] shengdeluo: Hardest part is remembering the characters and getting used to the tones
[1:45:10] shengdeluo: That's shou
[1:45:18] shengdeluo: 受
[1:45:37] shengdeluo: 方
[1:46:29] shengdeluo: It was ok
[1:47:13] razer_mon: Thats me MONKAS
[1:47:14] shengdeluo: I mean, it took me about 2 years to kinda get used to it
[1:47:31] shengdeluo: Getting used to it meaning I was ok to just converse with Chinese people about random stuff
[1:47:45] shengdeluo: It's possible, but not with 2hrs a day
[1:48:28] shengdeluo: In my experience, learning a language is best done in a setting where the language is spoken by all
[1:48:49] shengdeluo: I wouldn't have learned Chinese if I didn't live in china for 5 years
[1:49:25] shengdeluo: To the right side of the teacher
[1:50:06] shengdeluo: Of the*
[1:50:23] shengdeluo: Swap "the" and "of"
[1:50:43] shengdeluo: Not correct
[1:50:57] shengdeluo: "At" is also wrong
[1:51:53] shengdeluo: Do you speak any other languages besides English?
[1:52:09] shengdeluo: Or might that give away your identity? :D
[1:52:45] shengdeluo: Aight
[1:52:58] shengdeluo: Texas YEP
[1:53:34] shengdeluo: Ooo i like this
[1:54:59] shengdeluo: If you want to learn characters, try finding a special notebook that's used for writing characters
[1:55:21] FuryRespect: Dude, that's got to be the hardest language in the world
[1:56:05] shengdeluo: Yeah
[1:56:10] shengdeluo: It's basically squares
[1:56:22] shengdeluo: @hazretimert_ no, Arabic is kinda hard
[1:56:40] shengdeluo: Hungarian is also quite hard from a grammatical point of view
[1:56:52] shengdeluo: Finnish also
[1:57:06] shengdeluo: I'm learning Portuguese rn
[1:57:33] shengdeluo: Literally no one besides Hungarian speaks Hungarian
[1:57:38] shengdeluo: It sounds awful
[1:58:02] FuryRespect: @shengdeluo Actually, I am Turkish. Arabic is not very difficult, I think Turkish is more difficult
[1:58:02] shengdeluo: Chinese is more of an internationally recognized language
[1:58:13] razer_mon: MONKAS
[1:58:52] FuryRespect: because Turkish is an agglutinative language
[1:59:10] shengdeluo: @hazretimert_ ah, I see.
[1:59:29] shengdeluo: Yeah, it's pointless to learn Hungarian
[1:59:36] shengdeluo: Waste of time
[1:59:49] shengdeluo: There are so many nice languages to learn
[2:00:32] shengdeluo: @ipav999 try watching some Chinese kids cartoons
[2:00:42] shengdeluo: It helped me a lot
[2:01:03] shengdeluo: Then you can move onto tv shows
[2:01:19] shengdeluo: And at some point, you can move onto reading news papers
[2:01:29] shengdeluo: I mean, it's kids shows
[2:01:39] shengdeluo: It's called manhua
[2:01:45] shengdeluo: Not spongebob
[2:01:47] shengdeluo: I mean
[2:01:53] shengdeluo: Think smaller kids
[2:01:59] shengdeluo: Like close to baby age
[2:02:33] shengdeluo: I couldn't recommend any as it's been quite a while ago
[2:02:56] shengdeluo: Yeah, maybe
[2:03:27] shengdeluo: Once you can understand what they say on Chinese news, you're almost at a very good level
[2:03:42] shengdeluo: Between hsk 4-5
[2:04:12] shengdeluo: 当然啦
[2:04:19] shengdeluo: Of course
[2:04:27] shengdeluo: Very easy
[2:04:34] shengdeluo: Much easier than writing by hand
[2:04:41] shengdeluo: Yeah
[2:04:45] shengdeluo: It's just pinyin
[2:05:00] shengdeluo: So you just gotta differentiate the characters
[2:05:21] shengdeluo: I can handwrite also, but it's very sloppy
[2:06:03] shengdeluo: Your 右边 is wrong
[2:06:09] shengdeluo: You wrote 左边
[2:06:16] shengdeluo: Left
[2:06:36] shengdeluo: Zuǒ
[2:06:55] shengdeluo: Yep
[2:07:36] shengdeluo: It's Beijing dialect
[2:07:40] shengdeluo: It's the same
[2:07:50] shengdeluo: 儿 is just beijing hua
[2:08:32] shengdeluo: Well, let me stop you there
[2:08:37] shengdeluo: Calling it Chinese is wrong
[2:08:48] shengdeluo: What you're learning is Mandarin
[2:09:02] shengdeluo: Mandarin is the so-called standard Chinese
[2:10:43] shengdeluo: Zuǒ biān
[2:12:58] shengdeluo: Gl!
[2:13:13] shengdeluo: 不用谢哈
[2:13:19] shengdeluo: 不客气
[2:13:38] shengdeluo: No
[2:13:44] shengdeluo: Yes, you're welcome
[2:15:57] shengdeluo: Sry, someone rang my doorbell

[3:29:31] Mdlnyc: who ever is the clown is who i watch
[3:30:12] LtChezo: @y50xd just build AP liandries, nashors etc
[3:30:36] Bluichu: oh my god is that teemo?
[3:30:39] y50xd: @LtChezo thx
[3:30:46] Aldurfus: @Bluichu no that's urgot
[3:30:55] Lensendlot: @y50xd definetly malignance. Even after the nerf, teemo is more then ever now reliant on that item, because they nerfed him as an answer to that item. If you skip it on any ap teemo build, you essentially get weaker. The nerfs he got are bacause that item is turbo strong on him
[3:31:02] Bluichu: oh right ty gud sir
[3:31:09] Bluichu: TriHard 7
[3:32:24] Lensendlot: @y50xd Prob. Nashor, liandr, malignance, shadowflame, void (not in order) - Look for stuff that enhances your dmg in % (liandri, void staff) because those scale into eachother. Your Liandri deals more damage if you have the pen from void, etc.

[3:33:13] y50xd: @Lensendlot thx bro
[3:33:17] jhinrela: XD
[3:33:18] Lensendlot: @y50xd np
[3:35:50] Lensendlot: @y50xd i would also look to buy void more often then raba, i know big numbers are cool, but the % pen from voidstaff enables items like shadowflame, malignance, liandri more efficiently then the flat ap rabadons give you.  All of the above deal magic damage so voidstaff makes all your existing items stronger, whereas rabadons makes your abilities (and scaling items) stronger, but has the side effect of being not 100% effective because teemo has not so high ap scalings, which reduce the actual "u
