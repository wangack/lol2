[0:44:47] m0tal1z: bro drinks alchool like its water
[0:44:51] dayvanmir: i think the second one is more like "wise" than smart
[0:44:52] jkbluing: Not exactly
[0:44:52] oneframer: nop
[0:44:55] 0hzera: no
[0:45:02] Hykeir: asking real questions
[0:45:04] moodymind4: D:
[0:45:06] oneframer: iq is heavily based on education
[0:45:09] iamfame: Some people with high iq losing their mind cause of their own thoughts.
[0:45:11] Zeruel_TV: In social sciences we got the saying "intelligence is what is messured by the intelligence test" lol
[0:45:12] Arhil120: @definitelynottimt conq jayce is a rare species tbh
[0:45:12] RmndSchwrtz: IQ represents how good u can solve iq tests xdd
[0:45:16] mrkanto: Just league and moms
[0:45:19] oneframer: if your education is shit your iq will also be lower
[0:45:19] jkbluing: It's like a buff that helps you in life it isn't the be all
[0:45:28] gegemcoc: did you try hubris edge of night into vayne? its pretty good in my mmr(d2-d1) @naayil
[0:45:30] Leadwalls: Leadwalls subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[0:45:34] Flaeenn: oh a turkish song, im happy
[0:45:40] jkbluing: WHAT
[0:45:46] OskarG88: ?
[0:45:52] Fbloker: i guess both intelligence and success are almost impossible to define, is success = money? not for everyone
[0:45:52] jkbluing: Oh you mean that
[0:45:54] xXFaze_DankXx: ?
[0:45:58] qoqo123456789: that is history
[0:46:00] Zeruel_TV: yes
[0:46:01] Hykeir: how many countries does austria have?
[0:46:02] OskarG88: yes
[0:46:02] intingkarthus: HUH  󠀀
[0:46:03] Hykeir: im lost
[0:46:07] mustafak000: I coold not imagine listening ezhel in this stream
[0:46:09] NineTailsMontage: Yes
[0:46:10] soulcombustion: @qoqo123456789 that is geography xdd
[0:46:11] Trapi___: Education is critical thinking. It is more than "geography" or "history"
[0:46:12] Trapi___: bad take
[0:46:21] gincks: @Naayil  bro idk what to do. last season d2 now im giga stuck low emerald i legit cant win games..
[0:46:38] qoqo123456789: ohh miss click
[0:46:39] Hykeir: @gincks early season is like that
[0:46:45] n0miie: thats becasue your a streamer
[0:46:48] jokay76: why not ban vayne ? i feel your pain
[0:46:49] spamrengspam: skill issue
[0:46:50] moodymind4: institutions are better than universities because institutes teach you how to do the work you do in a job but universities teach you things that are useless like history and art that are worthless @Naayil
[0:46:59] gincks: @Hykeir but ppl actually running it down 70% of the time
[0:46:59] hiltskywards: @Trapi___ math problems maybe, but most of the lessons do not need critical thinking
[0:47:00] xiaominglong: this vayne's skill is not at GM fr
[0:47:07] deusvolt4307: algaebra is simple maths friend, the sea plant algae+bra algaebra
[0:47:09] abdullah3rd: u forgot
[0:47:12] zeka_e36: @jokay76 irelia desrves it more and more and more
[0:47:12] Fbloker: as an electrical engineer, Pythagoras became critically important, so yeah, yay math?
[0:47:15] oneframer: thats why iq is not the way when you want to know if someone is smart or not. iq is just random logic puzzles that you can do better if you went to school or not
[0:47:18] jucaoemide: i agree there is no reason to learn those things
[0:47:23] n0miie: @Naayil maybe its worthless because your a streamer :p
[0:47:27] 6legsbigpp: Learning increase ur intelligence
[0:47:30] jkbluing: @naayil pythag9s and algebra are used in building and other jobs it's not worthless. Schools do everything so you explore every topic.
[0:47:35] Hykeir: @Hykeir happens, which is why i dont play on my main I got +10 -17 at one point
[0:47:35] Trapi___: @hiltskywards critical thinking extends much further than just maths?
[0:47:36] green1emonviper: Well, depends what u want to do in life. If u want to be an architect u need geometry pretty much nonstop, or in my case programming, i need statistics
[0:47:40] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[0:47:41] xiaominglong: look
[0:47:43] soulcombustion: it is not worthless info @Naayil . You only get to stream because other people are really good at  those things. If no one was we wouldnt have such comfy lives
[0:47:48] brunescrune: we appreciate you talking to us <3
[0:47:48] xiaominglong: Range toplane
[0:47:52] abdullah3rd: she is rushing bork
[0:47:54] xiaominglong: no gap cs
[0:47:54] Hykeir: I play on smurf early season test some items
[0:47:55] 4GBv: do you have a backup plan
[0:48:00] xiaominglong: wtf is this vayne
[0:48:18] Zeruel_TV: No, you will drown tbh, I got 2 friends in that field lol
[0:48:23] le_jackalz: As an engineer you dont need all that math maybe 10% of it
[0:48:28] Ahmed___Hesham: what about the next iteam ?
[0:48:28] jkbluing: You learn THE HIGHER ADVANCED stuffthey don't have time to teach you again
[0:48:29] hiltskywards: LMAO
[0:48:34] Zeruel_TV: like you gotta take courses before the courses to stand a chance
[0:48:34] spamrengspam: u dont need high lvl of math for enginer @Naayil
[0:48:35] cocobuts12: naw
[0:48:35] xiaominglong: he plays vayne toplane and Aatrox is not gap big cs
[0:48:36] green1emonviper: Well, speaking from experience, now everyone can be an engineer because some people are just unable to think logically
[0:48:38] TripleSSSz: @Naayil Learning information no matter how useless causes new neural pathways to form and makes your brain become more effecient. Information is Information.
[0:48:39] Hykeir: ye depends on what you're engineering
[0:48:43] hashinshin_dont_ban_me: i use sin cos tan at work
[0:48:44] hashinshin_dont_ban_me: lol
[0:48:45] soulcombustion: I am an engineer, thats more or less true, but school gave a strong basis
[0:48:45] green1emonviper: Not*
[0:48:45] spamrengspam: its like in high school
[0:48:46] 4GBv: relearn is easier than learn
[0:48:46] Arhil120: time to kill tower Pog
[0:48:49] xiaominglong: bro this vayne is loser at GM
[0:48:49] kudipie: If you think you can pass engineer math having come out of elementary school ur delusional
[0:48:54] Fbloker: but that learning gives you the basis or even the ability to relearn or learn further
[0:48:56] lukenda11: Got more knowledge in Gimnasium bro than in college, i still remember shit from highschool...
[0:49:02] intingkarthus: kek
[0:49:03] Ahmed___Hesham: what do you about the next iteam ?
[0:49:13] lakilol123: i finished school half a year ago and i dont know shit now
[0:49:20] Zeruel_TV: definetly
[0:49:23] ary7au: yeah you maybe forget it but its activate your barin for doing other things like when you learn math problems your brain still solve real life problems in the same way without you knowing
[0:49:23] Hykeir: @Fbloker yeah but the system gives you like pass this exam or else you will regret it the rest of your life lmao
[0:49:25] jkbluing: It does, it is helpful
[0:49:28] moodymind4: i took accounting classes and i learned how to do financial statements by hand and when i worked as an accounting clerk everything was already automated and the statements were automatically generated so there was no point in learning how to do it manually since the start @Naayil
[0:49:31] Ahmed___Hesham: what do you about the next iteam ?.
[0:49:32] green1emonviper: Well, speaking from experience, not everyone can be an engineer because some people are just unable to think logically which is really important. Maths teaches u how to use your brain and use logic
[0:49:35] aktiveshorn: Its important to understand the world around you, no?
[0:49:54] jkbluing: Sheesh
[0:50:01] khaiizx: hi naayil. who do you always ban when using aatrox?
[0:50:05] soulcombustion: @moodymind4 yh schools are guilty of making you learn useless stuff like that ngl
[0:50:07] mand0mizer: mand0mizer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hi daddy naayil
[0:50:11] lalop228: why edge first
[0:50:15] chakkon420: how do u think u are landing those aatrox Q´s? pythagoras theorem ofc
[0:50:19] Flaeenn: @lalop228 cuz its vayne
[0:50:22] Eser4_6: ı dont speak englısh why only englısh
[0:50:25] OskarG88: if u do smh usefull in life education is important
[0:50:28] jkbluing: Sometimes
[0:50:29] soulcombustion: Thats reductive and silly
[0:50:29] green1emonviper: Actually, half the things in the world are math
[0:50:29] godm3me_: ye i do
[0:50:31] Ahmed___Hesham: what do you think  about the next iteam ?
[0:50:33] Foad_Barrantes: It depends
[0:50:36] Hykeir: @Eser4_6 easier to moderate
[0:50:39] TripleSSSz: sometimes yea. but im on the spectrum so...
[0:50:40] Zeruel_TV: I mean did you ever build something yourself lol
[0:50:43] Arhil120: @lalop228 coz vayne top to not get condemned while going for a 1v1 all in
[0:50:45] i_artoria_i: I only repair some parts below the screem
[0:50:49] godm3me_: 5 fucking ads
[0:50:57] Ahmed___Hesham: man what do you think about the next iteam ?
[0:51:02] jkbluing: Sometimes yeah especially when I do buildings and stuff
[0:51:04] abdullah3rd: its boring
[0:51:08] bigyodacheese: @Zerutonin Lego car probably kek
[0:51:08] jkbluing: In games
[0:51:13] Fbloker: @Hykeir i guess it's hard to find a good "method" to motivate kids to learn, kids and teenagers are chaotic and school forwards a lot of information to them, they are not internally motivated
[0:51:20] green1emonviper: Well, if there were no math u wouldn't be playing this game rn or been able to stream it. Guess it is important
[0:51:20] aul3q: your games is based on maths
[0:51:27] Foad_Barrantes: If you play minecraft i guess thats kinda normal
[0:51:30] icakiee: saw you match with The Bausffs yesterday
[0:51:38] raphaelhas: "I need to chill" - Insta ult
[0:51:47] Ahmed___Hesham: BUY MAW ?
[0:51:49] noxrealm: hi nayyil

[0:51:54] Foad_Barrantes: WinningQ
[0:51:56] jkbluing: Teammates
[0:51:56] ilyasshss: cuz top is very useful lmao
[0:51:56] lalop228: @Arhil120 if vayne top why no comet ?
[0:51:57] Aatrox696969: Topgap kekw

[0:52:00] Eser4_6: age of nıght very useless ıtem
[0:52:01] moodymind4: cuz top doesnt matter
[0:52:01] soulcombustion: The whole "it wont be any use  in my day to day life" argument people use about math is always so silly. Math is pure distilled logic and analytical sklls, if thats not useful I dunno what is
[0:52:02] Legiras: cuz he picked vayne top and coinflipped
[0:52:02] Zeruel_TV: because you crushed top 1v1
[0:52:03] Ahmed___Hesham: cause u have good team xxDD
[0:52:03] DL0ZAN0: jg diff

[0:52:39] Eser4_6: !rank
[0:52:40] LoLRankBot: NAAYIL is Master  165 LP (Solo/Duo)
[0:52:42] Ahmed___Hesham: YOU DIDN"T EVEN PLAY a 1 v 1 with vayne and edge of night
[0:52:45] dantefarimaconcroccante_: lol your team was Adolf tier
[0:52:46] Ystooos: damn the top gap this game was crazy
[0:52:49] brunescrune: when you back to austria?
[0:52:56] lexus19989: it’s actually useless to have religion, art or music in school for example. Math is useless after you passed middle school, I guess (for most of the people)
[0:53:01] instamo9000: @Naayil is it not worth taking comet into vayne?
[0:53:02] xiaominglong: he won
[0:53:04] OskarG88: your aura won it

[0:53:36] dayvanmir: lmao
[0:53:42] xiaominglong: KEKW
[0:53:46] xiaominglong: 3k dmg
[0:53:46] soulcombustion: You won because Talon had a good game, should he not solo carry if he has a good  game?
[0:53:47] RmndSchwrtz: it's sad that u got 0/1/1, 0/0/0 would be hilarious
[0:53:48] hashinshin_dont_ban_me: will that game be on youtube?
[0:53:50] xiaominglong: that's a lot
[0:53:51] Ahmed___Hesham: you was playing vs TheBauffs Yesterday HE WAS Mid I saw him talking about you

[0:54:00] Legiras: the most unskilled thing on top lane is fleet footwork vayne
[0:54:02] chriskolo13: urf is back on pbe server will you try it with aatrox ?

[0:54:52] franguestclain: prob when someone complains about getting banned?
[0:54:53] Legiras: yeah that works robot gets that
[0:54:57] daarius01: no
[0:54:57] intingkarthus: I write "pedophilia" in every report to get tham banned
[0:54:59] Ystooos: i feel like we are gonna see a lot of karma mid
[0:54:59] bigyodacheese: mmh depends cause some words are not banned without context so u need to report it
[0:55:00] Fbloker: maybe that causes the people to eventually have to read them
[0:55:01] jorabaran1: They read bit of it impossible to read all
[0:55:02] abuu_______: @legiras true and i will never understand why your jungler dont play around you
[0:55:05] Wowen44: any rioter in chat??

[0:56:23] Arhil120: @Naayil think the report system is based on number of reports in total or maybe a large number of reports in a short period of time and trigger word is player focused

[1:05:43] lukenda11: @CozyPorcupine singed is minion without ult buddy
[1:05:44] jkbluing: @moodymind4 so why do you think that there isn't that many Arabs in porn?
[1:05:45] Legiras: and he can end his ult whenever he wants to lol
[1:05:47] daarius01: !cannon
[1:05:52] leonid0512037: why you buy doran sward now ???? you sad that it is not good item for Aatrox
[1:05:55] Liquiduty: it gets longer by attacking and q ing
[1:05:56] MrPepperJams: isn't his mana cost the duration, so more man he has the longer it lasts?

[1:06:17] Faaret: Hey that "joke" on twitter was pretty bad, gootbye :)
[1:06:18] daarius01: dont go near walls i gues
[1:06:19] daarius01: guess
[1:06:23] trackts: steelcaps pretty much
[1:06:24] moodymind4: @jkbluing thats cuz porn is against Islamic morals and values.
[1:06:25] xprototip_ii: tarzaned moves Kreygasm
[1:06:41] panlocg: Its black cleaver still good?
[1:06:45] h0nkifurh0rny: is aatrox still seeing pro?
[1:06:45] ksifallenlight: well deserved report

[1:07:38] jkbluing: @h0nkifurh0rny I think so
[1:07:41] daarius01: malph has armor scalings on w as well
[1:07:41] GwenIsMyOshi: if so then yeah zeus just picked him today and stomped
[1:07:49] CozyPorcupine: @leonid0512037 why would he build bad items lmao
[1:08:06] Foad_Barrantes: Farming simulator
[1:08:10] kaioh_live: Cleaver reduces armor, instead of giving you armor pen. This reduces K'sante stats, and therefore his cooldowns/scaling (since he scales off armor)
[1:08:19] jkbluing: @moodymind4 but isn't pron not allowed in most religions?
[1:08:24] daarius01: @marcogun123 eve

[1:19:36] limuleev: Garen is moblie
[1:19:36] kurimaboi: its about spamming movement ability
[1:19:37] naudildus: Tank akali was kinda mobile
[1:19:40] Cybershock6: Riven is tankier then any champ with that broken a$$ shield KEKW
[1:19:40] kurimaboi: is lee into it?
[1:19:41] PolaroidYas: aatrox is an example
[1:19:53] instamo9000: ksantes mobility along with 2 unstopable abilities is ridiculous
[1:19:55] GwenIsMyOshi: k'sante is the resurrection of tank ekko from s6
[1:19:59] iKiTeX: aatrox has a low range dash with low ms i would not say aatrox is mobile
[1:20:06] CLG_Rampage: goated kindred omg
[1:20:09] WunWunWunWun_: @iKiTeX thats cope
[1:20:13] CozyPorcupine: ??????? a good kindred ult???? must be high elo
[1:20:20] MrPepperJams: Nerdge Mobility is "the ability to move or be moved freely and easily." according to google Kappa
[1:20:24] xeon77x: @iKiTeX aatrox is mobilr, not riven lvl, but definitely
[1:20:28] apsu_27: giga ULT BASED
[1:20:28] intingkarthus: I would smash kindred fr
[1:20:31] memerativo: ksante is a bruiser, the problem he is also a tank
[1:20:40] destroyleviathan: @intingkarthus ong
[1:20:41] CozyPorcupine: does his dash cd also scale with resistances?
[1:20:51] Wqdeee: Man complains about 8 cd dash yet has a 2.5 cd dash
[1:20:55] mugiwahara: he is a bruiser/tank but people just build him tank
[1:21:02] Cybershock6: Doesnt bruisers have ad ratios? Ksante has none @memerativo
[1:21:07] mugiwahara: idk why he is so mobile though it's broken
[1:21:12] karibol: @Wqdeee but Aatrox is not a tank
[1:21:13] GwenIsMyOshi: he has some ad ratios but they're kinda bad
[1:21:16] Wqdeee: he has 2 @mugiwahara
[1:21:20] razerfaceja: doesn't his armor get converted to AD when he ults?
[1:21:20] k1ckschneider: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:21:21] memerativo: @Cybershock6 ? ANd ap bruisers?
[1:21:24] nitit334: Aatrox is bruce wayne
[1:21:25] Thermidor5: riot champion design don't make any sense for years now
[1:21:27] intingkarthus: @Wqdeee it's shorter than a 5-year-old's penis stop yappin
[1:21:30] bigyodacheese: K'sante is just a Brute, half bruiser, half tank kek
[1:21:31] jkbluing: Bruiser Vs tank idiot
[1:21:33] Thermidor5: ksante is just a example
[1:21:33] ci1967: @Naayil i bet that u will have more dmg taken+healed than ksante taken+mitigated
[1:21:34] xeon77x: broozah
[1:21:44] Cybershock6: @memerativo and ap ratios, ksante has no ad or ap ratios that make sense, its all armor and mr ratios thats why we call it a tank
[1:21:45] moodymind4: also the unkillable poppy who beats everyone to death @Naayil
[1:21:48] Wqdeee: 8 second dash is not broken 😭😭
[1:21:51] Arhil120: think the original design philosophy for ksante was having a tank that doesnt get outscaled by fiora post 6 which in itself is kinda doomed to be broken KEKW
[1:21:53] CozyPorcupine: but if you go tank aatrox then you also are a mobile tank 🤓 Chatting
[1:22:10] WunWunWunWun_: @Wqdeee you have to be baiting
[1:22:12] jkbluing: Did that do any damage
[1:22:15] GwenIsMyOshi: he's an anomaly
[1:22:15] bigyodacheese: @Cybershock6 except he does have AP and AD ratios
[1:22:25] jabbuka69: reading comprehension is a real problem for these people @naayil
[1:22:28] nitit334: To be fair Gay'sante is desinged to be a tank that is mobile so.... gotta beat riot up for this one
[1:22:31] memerativo: @Cybershock6 ?Well yeah thats exactly what i said. He has kit and damage of a bruiser but since he scales with tankiness hes a tank
[1:22:46] CozyPorcupine: sidestep Pog
[1:22:53] Cybershock6: Oh really? then you should try building titanic and try to climb with it, except his q cooldown will be 4 seconds without resists @bigyodacheese
[1:23:06] Cybershock6: Chat is so bronze omg
[1:23:17] s0ulpunish3r: goodgrindasol subscribed with Prime. 
[1:23:18] Wqdeee: deadass
[1:23:36] abuu_______: toplane in game pro are just 2 tank afk farm this so sad
[1:23:37] zizizi321: i think item haste rune doesnt worth to use with only sundered, this runes set better
[1:23:53] bigyodacheese: @Cybershock6 lmao that's not what I said tho, but he does have AD ratios on Q and W and AP on R, that's for fact
[1:23:53] Cybershock6: @memerativo can agree with that, but i must admit i prefer ksante over riven or fiora
[1:23:59] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil

[1:24:46] moodymind4: i feel like jungle is the most important role in the game. if u coinflip a bad jungler i feel like the game is totally lost
[1:24:56] Cybershock6: @bigyodacheese and i said he doesnt have ad or ap scaling that makes sense to build on, anyone who plays ksante with conq or titanic hydra is trolling their team, just like yas or yone not building crit
[1:25:06] limuleev: i like how he just kidnap you
[1:25:11] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[1:25:26] sayfdiig: i think its support and jungle
[1:25:33] n00binati: are you the strongest because youre mid lane or are you mid lane because you're the strongest
[1:25:34] moodymind4: yes
[1:25:42] pilazoro: Support is the most broken no?
[1:25:45] bigyodacheese: @Cybershock6 yep, I dont even know what's the purpose of these ratios tbh... maybe aram?
[1:25:58] Cybershock6: @matoG4 can agree
[1:26:05] GwenIsMyOshi: top lane is either 1v9 or mike wazowski
[1:26:07] Clayland64: what do you think the least impactful role is??
[1:26:17] Arhil120: @Naayil feel like tp changes and tower plates made toplane the way it is today impact wise
[1:26:24] sennabon_: top lane can show its power at grubs
[1:26:24] gojira10265: why did you go second wind?
[1:26:30] bigyodacheese: Last season was so bad compared to this one already
[1:26:44] Cybershock6: @Cybershock6 riot doing riot stuff, maybe its intended to get benefit out of buffs like fire dragon idk
[1:26:54] sayfdiig: in late game toplane its the most broken role imo
[1:27:00] morthius444: HAHAHA
[1:27:01] osama5628: what is the counterplay to feeders on botlane ?
[1:27:02] razerfaceja: have you played any aatrox mid?
[1:27:04] nitit334: He yielded
[1:27:05] chopsuey21: RIOT
[1:27:10] Cybershock6: But full tank ksante full charge r w dealing half health is a bit much
[1:27:10] CozyPorcupine: baron evaporated
[1:27:26] GwenIsMyOshi: top lane has some of the biggest playmaker champions and some scaling monsters imo
[1:27:27] ci1967: @Naayil i bet that u will have more dmg taken+healed than ksante taken+mitigated
[1:27:33] noctosom: vayne top lategame
[1:27:34] adudewatchingvideos1: did baron in 5 seconds lol
[1:27:42] GwenIsMyOshi: you have shit like vayne and gwen up there
[1:27:44] grandeto: Not if you are Trundle and just destroy whole their base :D
[1:27:45] carry_me_xd: Not pantheon @naayil
[1:27:45] ahmedinholol: nasus?
[1:27:50] SilentNebuIa: what do you think about new passive move that its not canclable
[1:27:57] morthius444: THERES NO LATE GAME ANYMORE
[1:27:57] grandeto: and scale like crazy even if you lose the lane
[1:27:58] xeon77x: do you feel like someone like Sett got better this season?
[1:28:02] daarius01: ksante is GAME
[1:28:13] WunWunWunWun_: Surely Eclipse 3rd is nutt
[1:28:15] Thermidor5: @SilentNebuIa they didn't canceled this change?
[1:28:16] Cybershock6: Darius changed a lot now, better late game then before
[1:28:18] moodymind4: tbh i play warwick top and i destory aatrox in the mid game in Master tier
[1:28:28] SilentNebuIa: what do you think about new passive move that its not canclable?
[1:28:37] ahmedinholol: @wunwunwunwun_ i like eclipse allot on aatrox
[1:28:45] bigyodacheese: @moodymind4 no shit bro WW is broken in 1v1
[1:28:51] ci1967: u have more dmg taken + healed than ksante taken+mitigated so why yap about him being tanky if he is completely useless he is just annoying too
[1:28:55] intingkarthus: POGGIES
[1:29:00] nels0n56: wTCH me play
[1:29:03] F1nn_LoL: thougs on hydra?
[1:29:12] Thermidor5: jesus
[1:29:14] SilentNebuIa: what do you think about new passive move that its not canclable?
[1:29:19] F1nn_LoL: on aatrox, profane atleast
[1:29:20] xeon77x: do you feel like someone like Sett got better this season? @Naayil
[1:29:21] ahmedinholol: whats ur opinion on shen @naayil
[1:29:22] maerkc: Hello Papa Naayil
[1:29:27] F1nn_LoL: koreans are rushing it so im just curious
[1:29:34] GwenIsMyOshi: zeus went profane earlier, didn't he?
[1:29:34] CozyPorcupine: @F1nn_LoL there are 3 hydras Madge
[1:29:39] WunWunWunWun_: yeah
[1:29:47] WunWunWunWun_: brut component 1st is insane
[1:29:51] ttaters: koreans be building whatever tho
[1:29:53] F1nn_LoL: its really good if you get brutalizer first base atleast
[1:29:54] Wowen44: zeus does
[1:29:55] bigyodacheese: @F1nn_LoL I think it has a lot to do with them having a Rell jungle, its for big AOE combos
[1:30:01] SPIECTIER: Zeus playing profane hydra rush yep
[1:30:01] intingkarthus: tiamat is kinda ass on aatrox tho
[1:30:05] abuu_______: kr dont know how to build
[1:30:14] othgam_too: how about trinity force
[1:30:24] SPIECTIER: profane is built out of brutalizer
[1:30:25] ci1967: what do u mean it doesnt have fullclear, 3 q hydra and crip dies ?
[1:30:29] zessgz: zeus play profane today
[1:30:34] labidiomart98: try titanic hydra
[1:30:40] Tac0_Tornado: @Naayil dont you like focus on spacing with aatrox so the aoe of profane is not really efficient no?
[1:30:44] n00binati: naayil would you lose
[1:30:44] h3llhoud: prob good when you snowball
[1:30:45] Cybershock6: You used to do draktar rush BRUH, same thing
[1:30:47] WunWunWunWun_: no
[1:30:50] ttaters: no
[1:30:51] andio050222: No
[1:30:51] SPIECTIER: nope
[1:30:51] ttaters: ad ah
[1:30:53] WunWunWunWun_: 25 ad 10AH 8leth
[1:30:54] SPIECTIER: doesnt
[1:30:55] alexhun56: No
[1:30:57] daarius01: no
[1:31:02] intingkarthus: nah
[1:31:06] instamo9000: going lethality is just not worth it, the damage increase is pretty minimal compared to what youre giving up
[1:31:10] daarius01: 1337 gold
[1:31:11] keanw: 3300
[1:31:12] abuu_______: true kr player dont know how to build
[1:31:22] Cybershock6: Draktar wasnt
[1:31:22] trckfngr: true
[1:31:24] smaolll: pigs banning aatrox now
[1:31:26] WunWunWunWun_: give it a go this game
[1:31:41] intingkarthus: eclipse has a very good shield
[1:31:44] KryptoBlade: @Naayil have you seen what pros go on Aatrox in pro league?
[1:31:47] CozyPorcupine: eclipse tooltip in game says it deals 20% max hp on proc lol I thought it was broken
[1:31:50] intingkarthus: and its damage is mediocre
[1:31:50] CozyPorcupine: but it is actually 8%
[1:31:52] bigyodacheese: @deadlywlock nah u got to watch the whole picture, it fits the teamcomp when u have Rell jngl engages and set up
[1:31:52] ci1967: allmost yes pretty much
[1:31:52] hollowdron: nah profane aint worth on aatrox
[1:31:57] SilentNebuIa: what do you think about new passive move that its not canclable?
[1:31:57] SPIECTIER: and therefore eclipse was like best scaling item cause of 4% armor pen per legendary item bought
[1:31:57] stoprobal: and 3.4k item is really expensive for first item so the enemy laner will prob get their item first
[1:32:01] sultan892: go skin eclipse plzz

[1:32:50] CozyPorcupine: just double your cs and you can buy both Pepega
[1:32:51] ci1967: @Naayil with profane hydra active u do pretty much a lot of dmg, if the target below 50% hp u deal 150% of ur AD
[1:32:56] alexhun56: Hydra is really expensive
[1:32:56] morthius444: in a lck game
[1:33:07] hollowdron: well at least u can try

[1:33:47] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[1:33:47] vaster223: @Naayil what do you think about the sundered sky change 150 hp for 10 ad? is it a nerf for aatrox?
[1:33:52] WunWunWunWun_: you go pickaxe > brut
[1:33:55] WunWunWunWun_: not tia 1st yeah
[1:33:58] Cybershock6: Ok so about your argument that it having no health, then explain why draktar was being build on aatrox before this season? Not eclipse, think of draktar.
[1:33:59] labidiomart98: @deadlywlock !runes
[1:34:18] abuu_______: @labidiomart98 thanks bro
[1:34:23] abuu_______: !runes
[1:34:27] memerativo: 8 lethality for 237 gold is worth or no
[1:34:29] hugocaserooo: well theres no more armor runes
[1:34:44] kioubisto: Nerfed ?
[1:34:54] keanw: profane also kinda looks like it'll get nerfed
[1:34:57] ci1967: imagine u have enemy toplaner riven who builds ionian boots so she has 60 armor and with this 1300 item u ingore 8 armor its good
[1:35:10] SilentNebuIa: what do you think about new passive move that its not canclable?
[1:35:17] ci1967: active deals 150% of ur ad to enemies below 50% health
[1:35:18] CozyPorcupine: the active did surprising damage, but I built it on talon
[1:35:18] Arhil120: profane hydra looks like a gamba item
[1:35:19] instamo9000: @memerativo on dirk you pay like 50 gold for 10 lethality
[1:35:32] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[1:35:34] ifyoufeedigoafk: well it does 400dmg to low health enemies
[1:35:35] Cybershock6: Agreed on sundered
[1:35:35] vaster223: @Naayil what do you think about the sundered sky change 150 hp for 10 ad? is it a nerf for aatrox?
[1:35:40] KryptoBlade: Sundered Sky clears every other item as first item on Aatrox only Spear of Shojin gets close ngl @Naayil
[1:35:58] flickeerrr: dady zeus built it so its good xD
[1:35:59] ci1967: tbh only active is argument
[1:36:05] ifyoufeedigoafk: the active is rlly rlly good it rlly does a lot of dmg
[1:36:14] bigyodacheese: Kingen went for it in an LCK game too and the 3rd Q + profane was kinda nuts. But again, I think this build is only viable cause they are in a team/competitive set up and they ALWAYS had a Rell jngl for AOE combos setup !
[1:36:25] s0ulpunish3r: active on rengar is broken af
[1:36:29] abuu_______: @flickeerrr alot pro player dont know how to build bro

[1:37:28] hollowdron: @ci1967 why do u watch gay porn

[1:37:55] xxauriel: @ci1967 are you saying theres sth wrong with that?
[1:37:59] SilentNebuIa: what do you think about new passive move that its not canclable?

[1:38:22] CozyPorcupine: wdym passive move?

[1:39:11] ci1967: @Naayil why dont go eclipse 3rd or 4th if u have ingenious hunter ?
[1:39:15] nooblet29: at what level does the scaling rune give more health than the 65 hp
[1:39:22] AatroxGaming52: have you ever experienced the new nemesis quest yet? @Naayil
[1:39:22] bigyodacheese: Why taste of blood instead of sudden impact?
[1:39:27] daarius01: hello
[1:39:27] GwenIsMyOshi: @xeon77x it's got a stun component iirc
[1:39:29] Cybershock6: Can you try out sundered eclipse steraks with ingenious you took?
[1:39:30] KryptoBlade: damn Master in GM/Challenger Lobby high MMR
[1:39:33] KryptoBlade: we like that
[1:39:35] ci1967: @nooblet29 around 9-11
[1:39:35] apogee011: It already gives 60 hp at lvl6 if you pick 180 rune
[1:39:35] abuu_______: i want buy gucci prestige aatrox , i hope he will comeback in the market
[1:39:40] xeon77x: @GwenIsMyOshi ohh i see tyty

[1:39:45] daarius01: so always tenacity right?
[1:39:49] Ac1D64: @nooblet29 lvl 6/7,its +10hp per lvl
[1:39:51] instamo9000: @nooblet29 level 7 i think, pretty sure its 10 per level
[1:39:56] Rafapousin: ingenius is basically only for sunderer no?
[1:40:01] hugocaserooo: as long as u are lvl 7 is better the scaling one
[1:40:03] ci1967: oh ok
[1:40:06] Arhil120: scaling hp is an extra ruby crystal in the bag technically speaking
[1:40:13] nancolm: is scaling hp bad?
[1:40:17] Cybershock6: Cheap shot could be good but taste is a lot better
[1:40:18] Tac0_Tornado: but how sexy is aatrox goddamn
[1:40:27] daarius01: why not?
[1:40:27] 3ryko: hello naayil what are u banning?
[1:40:28] naudildus: @naayil  opinion on viagra + laxative combination????
[1:40:33] godm3me_: i dont like scaling hp

[1:40:36] s0ulpunish3r: i guess depends on matchups better with tenacity
[1:40:42] CozyPorcupine: the movespeed is mega trap on legit everyone tho, no?

[1:41:14] instamo9000: ye the movespeed shards gotta be so useless

[1:41:50] bigyodacheese: @leviorus it used to be Mecha Aatrox with white chroma, but maybe that changed
[1:41:50] xprototip_ii: tenacity affects slows?
[1:41:55] daarius01: what about airborne lol
[1:41:58] hugocaserooo: imo the move speed one has to be at the bottom not in the middle with the adaptive force
[1:42:02] bigyodacheese: @xprototip_ii ofc
[1:42:05] urtipicalJUMONGjr: agree
[1:42:09] daarius01: yone can cc harder then a morgana
[1:42:12] apogee011: The game will be fixed if that happens so for riot its a no

[1:42:21] hollowdron: u are in the air for shorter time
[1:42:22] daarius01: i mean it doesnt make sense
[1:42:23] desmodkiller: at this point just remove knockups
[1:42:25] xeon77x: how is that gonna look tho if you hit your q on them? even less knock up? lol
[1:42:33] ottooffi: morgana too
[1:42:37] CozyPorcupine: I have been hit by a sion Q :)

[2:37:57] maxastro0: The thing about udyr is which abilitiy he empowers the blue thingy (Q2) does max hp dmg his shield becomes way stronger gives lifesteal and healing his e makes him cc immune and way faster and auto stuns and his r makes it follow you
[2:38:14] BrotherHootz: it was till people started playing ranged top @Naayil
[2:38:16] maxastro0: So the reason his q did a lot is he empowered it and u weren't around any minions

[5:15:51] NinzElemental: Nilah only good when 4 items or more
[5:15:54] topi1337: @Naayil Do you think its good idea in general to skip shojin as second item when you are behind to instead build tankiness ?
[5:16:25] kryival: Omen or edging night would be good next item?
[5:16:34] ryx99: @topi1337 he doesnt think, he doesnt read the chat at all :|

[5:17:27] ryx99: @emanor18 yoo me too please
