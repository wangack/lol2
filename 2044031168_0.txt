[0:57:21] Takaeus: That dude from HBO who did the cod ui
[0:57:25] ChucktownTiger: I think that would be a neat way to tell whihc die rolled what result
[0:57:34] Takaeus: Im not saying he should be fired but he should be fired

[2:56:01] xgrizzly996: I mean at least he is only support but it's still bad cause he will pick better fights for his team
[2:56:06] ArcyArcanine: This video feels very 2017 LoL, but I know it's recent cause of the awful new map layout.
[2:56:11] ReignCold: As someone who has a lot of hours I'm each rank, it's not the same game after a certain rank. It's just not the same astart8Okfine
[2:56:15] JAD1920: rocket league smurf go hard also

[2:56:40] StormShooter: I found mark through his cycle beta video where he met the guy doing the worlds first recorded letium drill., the good ol days
[2:57:28] Tommy_Scars: Mark introduced me to the double bulldog meta in The Cycle

[2:58:36] JAD1920: 11

[2:58:50] Th3GingerHitman: 2X  on a Scrapper gunplay
[2:58:56] Tommy_Scars: Yea you do what feels right man. That's all you can do
[2:59:09] ArcyArcanine: Palworld is so last catalog
[2:59:34] ReignCold: Idk if this is a hot take or not, the gap between diamond and challenger is bigger than silver and diamond
[2:59:40] ReignCold: astart8Sip
[2:59:54] ArcyArcanine: @ReignCold True
[2:59:55] Juzika031: howdy buckos
[3:00:15] ChessMatch: i tried watching it, glad youre not doing it wither mstvOG
[3:00:16] StormShooter: You attracted the right audience it seems
[3:00:19] ObserverWardXXL: Im honestly impressed a game like palworld popped off so hard
[3:00:20] StormShooter: PATS SELF ON BACK
[3:00:25] RevenantTRCO: id love to ge tinto this game!
[3:01:02] rmac_whf: definitely addicting, been playing for 13+ years
[3:01:20] never4envy: Good morning all, how are the vibes today?
[3:01:22] ArcyArcanine: Most recommended with friends that don't take it too seriously but know what they're doing.
[3:01:27] Brodtz_: That's how I feel about dota. So many learning curves
[3:01:30] Nightbot: Make sure you follow Markstrom on Twitter for daily stream information and event scheduling! - www.twitter.com/markstromtv
[3:01:31] RossTheBossYo: you ever play for honor mark?
[3:01:32] Forrian: FINE i'll redownload league
[3:01:34] ReignCold: Seeing improvement overtime is definitely very addicting
[3:01:46] StormShooter: im so ass backwards I got into smite and paladins instead of league and overwatch
[3:02:01] Vibranator: For Honor was a great game at start imo
[3:02:05] Vibranator: Got worse over time

[3:02:21] ObserverWardXXL: Now im a fighting game player
[3:02:23] grovak: mark has some opinions on its multiplayer server structure that are pretty spot on
[3:02:30] Th3GingerHitman: Got bit by the eft bug sadly. And for the first time killed any of the bosses. Killed Shturman on woods.
[3:02:45] Vibranator: Fair.
[3:02:52] Vibranator: OH YEAH I remember now
[3:03:12] grovak: it was a fine solo player experience
[3:03:13] a_happy_badger: are we sitll on the mstvStall ?
[3:03:15] ObserverWardXXL: Yup for honor disappeared because netcode sucked without rollback and dedicated servers
[3:03:26] ReignCold: In that game blocking was 5 times harder than attacking
[3:03:30] Vibranator: Yeah P2P was booty, I totally forgot about the P2P. I mean I didn't have too many issues if I recall, but that doesnt mean everyone didnt
[3:03:34] ChessMatch: thats gotta be so depressing for the designers.... make a great game that performs like shit
[3:03:41] a_happy_badger: you have an impressive stall my friend
[3:03:42] never4envy: P2PvP is always a horrible design choice.
[3:03:43] ReignCold: And If toy kept blocking you get tossed down a cliff
[3:03:49] ArcyArcanine: Stahl? I prefer Lon'Qu.
[3:03:50] xgrizzly996: all those medieval fighting games get bad over time because people start hitting you through the ground and on back swings
[3:03:57] heeyysteve: Mark do you pref a poke support or tank?
[3:04:05] Vibranator: Then again I was a sweaty Nobushi player so.
[3:04:09] ObserverWardXXL: How is it i can play street fighter 6 with someone in japan and have a better experience than p2p for honor on the same continent
[3:04:10] Vibranator: I had the distance
[3:04:41] Forrian: aaand i redownloaded league, let's go see how ass i am
[3:04:57] rmac_whf: Shen is my fav tank rn
[3:05:03] TypeG: Pyke is fun for 15 minutes
[3:05:07] never4envy: How has the kiddo been and the other half?  Hope everyone is doing well!
[3:05:07] Drexxel22: ive had league ... well forever, and ive always been bad haha
[3:05:09] ReignCold: Bro... If you get good at Alistar, you are guaranteed to climb fast
[3:05:14] seanthemightycrowhunter: @ObserverWardXXL Ubi is a scrappy indie company with no resources and the SF6 people are a gigachad megacorp with all the best infra Kappa
[3:05:16] ReignCold: he is so good at roaming
[3:05:20] ArcyArcanine: My favorite tank is an elephant
[3:05:20] ReignCold: And flanking
[3:05:37] heeyysteve: @ReignCold that fugging guy is a real pain in the dck to go against
[3:05:42] ObserverWardXXL: Yeah i sont think ubiaoft doin so hot lately LUL
[3:05:44] never4envy: Huge facts, biggest W ever
[3:05:50] rmac_whf: @ReignCold  you see the problem with champs like ali and leo is you need a team to follow up on engages, and in my experience they dont do that often
[3:05:51] xgrizzly996: how old is he? Mine is almost 8months
[3:06:10] TypeG: always have been
[3:06:14] Tommy_Scars: Yupppp
[3:06:17] ReignCold: Also Blitzcrank is really good at the moment because he can roam easily
[3:06:40] Brodtz_: Cooked
[3:06:40] heeyysteve: that gams is HARD trash already
[3:06:59] NTiamgrunt: atlas is legit better LUL
[3:07:08] glorgashack: That game looks insanely bad
[3:07:21] Tommy_Scars: Played the beta. It wasn't anything special at all. Pretty much AC Black Flag without the super interesting stuff
[3:07:22] ReignCold: @rmac_whf I play mid and more often than not a blitz or Ali hard carries the game
[3:07:24] grovak: its also ubisoft which they jsut put out a satement syaing "gamers should be prepared for sub based games and getting used to not owning them"
[3:07:26] ObserverWardXXL: Any game thats 10 year in dev, launches outdated and underperforming
[3:07:32] grovak: statement*
[3:07:37] ChessMatch: i was lost the entire time Chel
[3:07:52] ArcyArcanine: Yasuo is a senior citizen now?
[3:08:00] ArcyArcanine: Dang, I'm old
[3:08:03] NTiamgrunt: yeah I think people like the pirate idea
[3:08:07] TheGreatPewdini: SoT Season 11 has been really good so far
[3:08:10] rmac_whf: @ReignCold  my teams are always such shit that if I'm not hard carrying then we're not winning, its rough haha
[3:08:21] Drexxel22: I want rockstar to make a Pirate era game,   RDR2 meets Blackflag
[3:08:32] ReignCold: Season 2024 cinematic was fire, did we watch it? @markstrom
[3:08:37] heeyysteve: speaking of Pirates I blew my sons mind yesterday when I responded "yes" to his question if Pirates are real LUL
[3:08:45] ChessMatch: @Drexxel22 thats why i was so hyped on a R* medieval game that was rumoured a few years back
[3:08:47] ChessMatch: would love that
[3:08:50] TheGreatPewdini: Well if you've been playing every season of course it is
[3:09:07] reddymade: Blackwake was fun
[3:09:12] TypeG: uncharted waters new horizons is when pirate games peaked
[3:09:15] TypeG: don't @ me
[3:09:19] ReignCold: @rmac_whf it's a skill to get carried, you can get better and improve at being carried. And it's a way more reliable wat to climb
[3:09:30] ReignCold: Way*
[3:09:33] Forrian: i haven't played this in 5 years, this should go... well
[3:09:37] ObserverWardXXL: No progression so the casuals cant get farmed like they belong in a chicken factory
[3:09:39] xgrizzly996: need another sid meiers pirates
[3:09:55] ChessMatch: @heeyysteve huge W
[3:10:03] seanthemightycrowhunter: A second Pirates! remake would kick ass
[3:10:19] ArcyArcanine: Pirates are less sophisticated today, and less dapper.
[3:10:21] heeyysteve: oh it was amazing. LUL caught him so off guard @ChessMatch
[3:10:36] rmac_whf: @ReignCold  I'd welcome anyone who can carry with open arms, I just don't get teammates who can do that.
[3:10:37] ReignCold: They are trying to make it Minecraft on boats astart8Sip
[3:10:43] NTiamgrunt: @ArcyArcanine thats a nice way to describe a bunch of coked up people on fishing boats with 80 year old guns LUL
[3:10:57] ChessMatch: @heeyysteve almost a "magic is real" moment lov eit haha
[3:11:10] heeyysteve: EXACTLY
[3:11:12] TheGreatPewdini: A modernized Pirates: Gold remake would be FIRE
[3:11:32] TheGreatPewdini: Oh @Markstrom they went the other way and made "Safer Seas" for people who can't handle getting pirated
[3:11:32] rmac_whf: @Markstrom  what rank is ya
[3:11:37] ReignCold: @rmac_whf trust me fiend
[3:11:40] Dotz105: less drip for sure
[3:11:46] ObserverWardXXL: Not a fan of instagram pirates? LUL
[3:11:57] spammantha: i think silver 2 or 1 right?
[3:12:03] spammantha: wahoo
[3:12:06] heeyysteve: god dammit Mark, now Im gonna update league. This is your fault
[3:12:37] ReignCold: @rmac_whf it's way less taxing letting others carry and not condemn them for every mistake they make
[3:12:46] ChessMatch: loooool
[3:12:47] B_Tired: @heeyysteve your lack of self control is nobody's fault asiWOT
[3:12:48] xgrizzly996: you been playing SoD?
[3:12:49] Forrian: i feel like he should take responsibility and guide the people he gets to play again through their first match back
[3:12:49] DakDak_210: YEPP CAN CONFIRM 11 I have 6 level 25s lol
[3:12:55] JAD1920: ruin me Mehk rooNya

[3:13:17] heeyysteve: @B_Tired NOT what society has been telling me for the past 10 years! peppREEE
[3:13:18] DakDak_210: I blame mark because I have no self control
[3:13:34] rmac_whf: @ReignCold There's an acceptable amount of error you can allow someone to make, but when your top laner is 0/8 within the first 7 minutes of a game its done at that point.
[3:13:37] ReignCold: My friend started league earlier this week, I've been building him from the ground up astart8Sip
[3:13:40] ChessMatch: B_Love mstvLove
[3:13:40] ArcyArcanine: I wonder how many people started playing WoW expecting to have coitus because of the claims in The Big Bang Theory. lol

[3:38:48] danbruhhdan: i thought r makes u untargetable ?
[3:38:50] regulosion: hexdrinker

[3:39:19] ReignCold: corki is AP yes
[3:39:23] regulosion: all his damg exepr AA is AP
[3:39:23] Woody_07: Might have to revisit it
[3:39:26] ReignCold: He does magic damage
[3:39:44] ReignCold: His basics also do magic damage I believe
[3:39:59] xgrizzly996: a percentage of it does
[3:40:09] ReignCold: Nodders
[3:40:19] regulosion: that's why I recommended Mercs this game
[3:40:27] BoostedMonkey27: Mern mstvCoffeeF

[3:42:27] danbruhhdan: its there dragon , lets face it
[3:42:31] rmac_whf: that's how he wins
[3:42:40] ReignCold: pick before team fights I think
[3:42:41] heeyysteve: blitz should be more worried about vision control at this point IMO
[3:43:13] danbruhhdan: evelyn needs to snowball
[3:43:25] danbruhhdan: shes not a great scaler
[3:44:00] ReignCold: Corki becomes a monster late game, I don't think you can 5v5 at any point in this game anymore
[3:44:14] ReignCold: You have to have man advantage before fight
[3:44:15] danbruhhdan: nice
[3:45:04] rmac_whf: @ReignCold  yeah but I think he's an item ahead of most of them so it could swing either way
[3:45:05] Lightorias: glgl
[3:45:17] regulosion: BT->Dominic
[3:45:38] ReignCold: @rmac_whf I'm just thinking what the consistent play is, I hate coin flipping

[4:35:32] DakDak_210: also why are middle aged people so obessed with joker quotes
[4:35:36] GamerDad: I now have an Iron 1,  A b4 and a G2 ::)
[4:35:54] SunnyCloudy1337: @ChessMatch the older you get, the grumpy & cranky you become
[4:35:55] heeyysteve: what is middle aged at this point? peppAwk
[4:36:17] xgrizzly996: enemy team very purple
[4:36:18] seanthemightycrowhunter: Older than me :)
[4:36:20] B_Tired: Things are more difficult for everyone. It happens. Still gotta keep on
[4:36:24] ChessMatch: @SunnyCloudy1337 i work actively against being a curmudgeon LUL
[4:36:26] ScoobiusMaximus: middle aged is like mid 40s
[4:36:30] GamerDad: I plan to live to 120 yrs , so I am middle aged ::)
[4:36:30] B_Tired: 45-50
[4:36:34] TheGreatPewdini: Me, I'm middle aged, everything hurts and I'm grumpy af

[4:36:48] Greencammo: well yeah now there expecting us to wrk until 70...
[4:36:55] SngleHanded: I run life on a basis of 100 yrs... I doubt I'll make it there but, that would relate 50s as midlife
[4:36:56] Moose__Nipples: i try to be as nice to people as i can but i have no time for anyones bullshit anymore
[4:37:13] B_Tired: I'm definitely a kermudgeon for most things
[4:37:13] heeyysteve: LUL I am dead at 60, been convinced of that since I was like 7
[4:37:20] seanthemightycrowhunter: I'm gonna live forever so middle aged would maybe be when I decide it is
[4:37:23] GamerDad: everythingg just hurts more XD
[4:37:28] ScoobiusMaximus: id rather die than live to 100 in minecraft
[4:37:32] xgrizzly996: taric might know
[4:37:33] GamerDad: how's the little one? driving yet?
[4:37:38] grovak: mid life crissis used to refer to people hitting 40 and buying something just outlandishly expensive
[4:37:46] aberman89: My wife doesnt think its funny but I keep telling her im gonna die shoveling snow when im 75 from a massive heart attack
[4:38:03] DakDak_210: not gonna lie most people in the like 18-24 bracket are just insufferable too
[4:38:14] mid_life_lunesta: regardless. after 30 testosterone starts to tapper off. at 50 years you start to lose about 10% muscle mass every ten years if you don'

[4:39:10] aberman89: @ChessMatch ya dude, i know like 10 people who died that way its crazy
[4:39:27] B_Tired: My test at 30 is significantly higher than my test at 20. Which is crazy cuz that's when I was playing college sport stuffs
[4:39:29] xgrizzly996: snow shoveling is a big workout
[4:39:35] ChessMatch: awful, but thats a funny thing to hold over her haha
[4:39:49] aberman89: i used to work as a custodian in the summers in highschool/after college when I needed money - lost 2 dudes on the job that way

[4:40:11] ChessMatch: ooooof thats terrible
[4:40:38] aberman89: you dont realize how straining on your body shoveling snow is
[4:40:58] aberman89: so basically what I am saying people, is buy a snowblower
[4:41:09] seanthemightycrowhunter: My dad slipped a vertebra many moons ago snow shoveling
[4:41:27] ChessMatch: you basically just talked me into bying and utility vevhicle with a plow abe
[4:41:44] aberman89: i promise i dont get commission @ChessMatch
[4:41:51] aberman89: im not part of big snow plow
[4:41:54] seanthemightycrowhunter: I'm partial to the school of many small shoveling jobs, rather than waiting for all 15cm of now to build up
[4:41:55] ChessMatch: oh i know
[4:41:59] aberman89: lol
[4:43:10] heeyysteve: chat, the wife wants to watch the Barbie movie tonight. Be real, is it any good?
