[0:16:04] koushik_10: ur secondary runes ? arent they bad on lilia
[0:16:59] johaido12: is that the grub pathing from the phylaris video?
[0:17:33] HarryBlopper: everytime you go against a fed lillia its literally death by a thousand cuts

[0:21:20] HarryBlopper: why do you let them have drake when you had prio on bot?
[0:21:34] Sylvain269: That’s what Broxah does too
[0:21:49] macywaky: ur not really fully squishy cuz u proc eclipse so well and the lifesteal from botrk gives u sustain
[0:21:52] Sylvain269: That’s exactly how Broxah builds Bel’Veth as well
[0:21:55] Ezelof: santorinWave
[0:22:40] duesenlol: is there any way to counter lillia?
[0:22:46] grandmakrystal: when do you switch from ward to sweeper?
[0:23:19] Sylvain269: @duesenlol CC or one shot her; Rengar I’d imagine is a good counter to her. Kha’Zix can be as well if you play it well
[0:24:02] Sylvain269: @grandmakrystal From all of the streamers I watch and myself personally, I switch to sweeping lens after the first ward is placed on first back
[0:24:17] grandmakrystal: @sylvain269 ty!

[0:25:34] macywaky: rift
[0:25:34] Sylvain269: @grandmakrystal Although if you play Lee Sin or Jax jungle then you obviously always keep wards as they’re the only two champions that can ward jump and rely on them to escape and disengages
[0:25:38] HarryBlopper: nothing like getting pinged by someone with no map awareness Happi

[0:42:49] getsometalentloser: even though he bard god himself says so
[0:42:55] johaido12: feels like you have to perma gank and hope it works
[0:43:11] Silfel: Makes sense, esp. if not enough high ranks are available

[4:06:48] macywaky: u r fed as hell
[4:07:06] LiILamb: Vi has lots of small intricacies with passive/auto resets. bad vi players dont make use of these
[4:07:36] macywaky: can we play belveth or trundle next game if circumstances allow it?
[4:07:49] thee_briefcase: its the ults for me, i take so many flash journies, that i didn't expect

[4:12:31] Ancarage: oh is that an on hit ad tf?
[4:12:43] Donawen: AD TF is so disgusting right now
[4:13:00] thesurgicalsurgeonsurge: @buggedaion talking about pinging when vi was 12 1
[4:13:06] TheGesterr: wow wtf did they do to TF LMAO
[4:13:12] TheGesterr: why is he AD champ now?
[4:13:19] VantageS4: Wait did they add pings back or did they just remove it for NA?
[4:13:38] BuggedAion: @thesurgicalsurgeonsurge ye but santorin was ranting how that same guy was flame pinging him before and now he's praising him
[4:14:06] darkkkona: 3 autoing everyone monkaS
[4:14:15] thesurgicalsurgeonsurge: Yeah and that's fine and ping is not a crime
[4:15:13] LiILamb: i think talon wants more
[4:16:05] koushik_10: back to back bangers
[4:17:16] d1a_lol: dingdingding XD

[4:17:48] Dezrunner: Winners queue baby, you can pay me 10% at the end of the day
[4:17:49] BuggedAion: cleaaan game
[4:17:55] TiGer568: @Santorin Is this build best on VI?
[4:17:59] Ancarage: ohhh
[4:18:12] PigeonSenti: so that's the kind of performance you need to win with bad teams, got it
[4:18:14] MouldyCheesePie: how strong do u think vi is santorin? top tier?
[4:18:18] d1a_lol: tf
[4:18:46] darkkkona: thinking back, the mid play where tf called you was maybe playable ? dont you think
[4:19:09] Ray701: belveth lillia are stronger imo
[4:19:10] macywaky: Yoo
[4:19:10] Ancarage: lilia is kinda a war crime atm monkaW
[4:19:14] darkkkona: yea where you went for camps
[4:19:24] macywaky: i left for a bit. glad to see u managed to pull the win
[4:20:02] darkkkona: more safe choice is camps
[4:20:05] TimeWizardLuL: how is nocturne?still good?
[4:20:07] MouldyCheesePie: ok thx, who u think top jungs are rn?
[4:20:19] macywaky: how to counter jax as belveth/trundle/viego? @Santorin
[4:20:25] thesurgicalsurgeonsurge: !rank
[4:21:10] TiGer568: @Santorin How good is Jarvan now?
[4:21:15] Ancarage: jg missing camps to hover for gank when they are up is similar to laner dropping waves just to roam
[4:21:20] Ancarage: is how i see it
[4:21:21] TimeWizardLuL: play some nocturne pls
[4:21:30] Ancarage: not the same extend of importance but similar concept
[4:21:31] MouldyCheesePie: ffs I got an ad.. did you say who u think top jungs are rn?
[4:21:52] macywaky: i swear this matchup for me is so cancer cuz i cant do anything and if he counter ganks we just auto lose
[4:22:18] MouldyCheesePie: j4 feels giga weak after nerfs and cdr removal
[4:22:21] macywaky: belveth game? @Santorin
[4:22:40] Wildcobra_: shen jung :)
[4:22:44] Virbello: every gore user just feels worse to me, lee feels ok but i still think gore was better
[4:22:51] Tourouviel: what do you think about brand jungle in this meta?
[4:23:19] TimeWizardLuL: brand is top 1 now
[4:23:29] KrazerTrick: Fiddle though?
[4:23:45] macywaky: @Virbello aatrox might be busted im not too sure but nyaail was popping off
[4:24:01] MouldyCheesePie: Thx! Viego, Vi, Xin, Trundle anywhere near those others?
[4:24:24] TimeWizardLuL: you path to weakside lane?
[4:24:37] Virbello: @macywaky ya i just considered aatrox an eclipse user but he did build gore at the end i think
[4:24:47] macywaky: yeah
[4:24:57] MouldyCheesePie: Why Overheal on Lilly?
[4:25:01] macywaky: i think gore was just way better on him tho cuz healing
[4:25:08] macywaky: @MouldyCheesePie passive heals her
[4:25:13] macywaky: so u can stack
[4:25:14] macywaky: easy
[4:25:20] WhoRainZone6969: Vs Lathy bard gl
[4:26:12] Ancarage: @macywaky aatrox top is pretty crazy atm with sunder sky, his R amplify the healing on it monkaW

[4:53:18] getsometalentloser: taliyah suffered this patch due to bad items for her @MouldyCheesePie
[4:53:51] TheGesterr: Taliyah is more draft dependent too
[4:54:40] macywaky: @Santorin do yuo have a yt channel?
[4:55:17] MouldyCheesePie: Sejuani has a surprisingly fast clear
[4:55:45] khoajsp: what do you do if you get late invaded and lose your entire quadrant? Just farm the other side? should you invade back?
[4:55:52] getsometalentloser: hows zac rn?
[4:55:59] macywaky: noice
[4:56:27] TheGesterr: @khoajsp kinda depends on a lot of variables tbh
[4:57:02] khoajsp: i figured... we had no lane prio so i just have to afk until the my camps spawn...
[4:57:06] khoajsp: that's a lot of wasted time lol
[4:57:11] GhostxxHorse: medicine
[4:57:24] TheGesterr: Pal World with that NA healthcare lmao
[4:57:25] GhostxxHorse: from the medieval medicine table or w/e
[4:57:35] MouldyCheesePie: Kayn has a good clear but I guess u think his early is too weak?
[4:57:58] MouldyCheesePie: Diana and Udyr have nice clears too?
[4:58:12] MouldyCheesePie: Sry I'm just asking about nearly every jungler :D
[5:00:11] macywaky: YOOO a Viego game poggers :))
[5:00:42] macywaky: AHAHAHA just what I was talking about xDD
[5:00:43] Ancarage: does jax rush tiamat in jg first now?
[5:01:04] macywaky: @Santorin bruiser mentality right :)
[5:01:14] nickshn: how were the games so far santorini?
[5:01:17] macywaky: also btw did u know jax e blocks ur ult
[5:01:21] macywaky: im pretty user
[5:01:45] macywaky: sure*
[5:01:57] getsometalentloser: ive been enjoying the ivern grind lol
[5:02:03] TheGesterr: WAIT REALLY?
[5:02:05] macywaky: thats so weird tho. how is ult an auto
[5:02:06] nickshn: wait viego's ulti is an AA?
[5:02:09] TheGesterr: how is Viego ult an auto?????
[5:02:10] nickshn: holy shit i didnt know that
[5:02:13] TheGesterr: that's so weird
[5:02:21] macywaky: fr
[5:02:29] macywaky: they should change that
[5:02:35] macywaky: same thing with nilah
[5:02:45] nickshn: welp time to double check it in game
[5:02:51] LiILamb: I actually didnt know that. wtf
[5:02:53] macywaky: her invincibility thingy makes her unkillable to viego
[5:03:09] macywaky: and she can put it on any champ
[5:04:18] macywaky: trist did fine
[5:04:36] Ancarage: yea viego R attacks a primary target then do aoe dmg to things near the primary target
[5:04:41] macywaky: kraken first no? kraken is huge powerspike against everyone else for dps?
[5:04:53] Ancarage: i learned that after shen bubbleed viego R PepeLaugh
[5:06:08] TorqueBandit: when trolling backfires
[5:06:15] nickshn: holy shit you wernt kidding that viego ulti is an empowered aa
[5:06:31] nickshn: i had to test it with triforce in practice tool
[5:06:41] nickshn: and it did auto proc the spellblade
[5:06:59] crecentbear: @macywaky want survivability w their melee comp
[5:07:29] macywaky: lvl 6 is a huge power spike on viego
[5:08:19] crecentbear: @macywaky yea but doesn't matter if you're squishy and get oneshot
[5:09:29] macywaky: @crecentbear ur ult makes it easier for u to kill + pick up passive forms so it helps. also the unstopable helps agains cc and its kinda like a dash so its ok to use for escape
[5:10:48] crecentbear: @macywaky tell santorin then i see why sundered sky first
[5:11:09] crecentbear: ult + passive don't matter if you die before you can use it lol
[5:11:38] TimeWizardLuL: i hate jax
[5:11:50] macywaky: viego normally has an assassinish burst playstyle
[5:11:51] TorqueBandit: they shared the answer to life
[5:11:57] Lez1994: u play nidalee santorin? ^^
[5:12:24] macywaky: santorin went sundered sky first because of jax e i think
[5:13:00] macywaky: cuz he cant auto
[5:13:43] TimeWizardLuL: whats the third item steraks?
[5:14:00] DJ_Photik: Same runes as normal?
[5:14:07] crecentbear: told ya lol
[5:14:18] getsometalentloser: @Santorin  if i play ivern + bel do i need to add anything else?
[5:14:20] MouldyCheesePie: Thoughts on Nunu, a guy in NA got rank 1 with it
[5:14:42] MouldyCheesePie: @getsometalentloser he said those 2 are rly high tier. He says Lillia nd Brand are strongest tho
[5:15:19] macywaky: @getsometalentloser maybe another ad jungl cuz bel has a pretty high ban rate
[5:15:42] MouldyCheesePie: @macywaky Only in high elo so depends on his elo
[5:16:30] macywaky: true
[5:16:49] macywaky: but if hes climbing high elo better learn a new champ before than later?
[5:17:07] TwoThirdsOfPizza: damm no trinity or kraken
[5:17:09] macywaky: playingn new champ in high elo might be bad so he could learn it for now?
[5:17:10] TwoThirdsOfPizza: busted

[5:38:49] Lez1994: yay nocturne! :D
[5:39:00] damm118: Im rooting for all the Danish guys

[5:40:52] frankenfoot5: Annie is absolutely disgusting this patch lol
[5:40:53] Ancarage: the only really fun jungler I dont really want to be viable again is Talon, I feel dirty just remembering it PepeLaugh
[5:40:59] Ancarage: it was so broken when Talon was viable PepeLaugh
[5:41:03] sidequest76: True
[5:41:11] MouldyCheesePie: why overheal on lillia?
[5:41:21] nickshn: monkaW

[5:41:40] macywaky: belveth angle
[5:41:40] nickshn: karma might be on my perma ban atm
[5:41:49] sir_jab: Where is the ww ban?!
[5:41:52] Ancarage: is karma that broken right now?
[5:41:53] sidequest76: @FreeXe Malignance for one
[5:41:57] Liumane: maybe nemesis was overestimating the 2% movespeed rune shard, it doesn't feel like it makes that big of a difference.. for junglers at least
[5:42:02] macywaky: jaxxx
[5:42:04] Ancarage: cause of malignance?
[5:42:10] FreeXe: @FreeXe So her AP build?
[5:42:26] Lez1994: is it annie bot?
[5:42:32] TheGesterr: they buffed Maligmuhnuts

[5:43:03] nickshn: but yea fuck karma atm
[5:43:10] nickshn: why buff her and ez on the same patch
[5:43:12] Ancarage: maybe Hecarim will care about that move speed
[5:43:26] getsometalentloser: @nickshn ez is skin seller
[5:43:31] macywaky: 5 ad/9ap right
[5:43:32] getsometalentloser: they wont let ezreal be bad
[5:43:42] macywaky: or hecarim
[5:43:50] macywaky: hecarim is so weak rn tho
[5:43:52] nickshn: its ok we win cus we got karma :)

[5:45:20] Ancarage: inb4 karma can fringe flex top too Kappa
[5:45:20] FreeXe: Buffing Ezreal was dumb. That champ wasnt bad
[5:45:57] nickshn: man buffing karma was a mistake
[5:46:03] dontcountonthewicked: corki azir meta making it's triumphant return
