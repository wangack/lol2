[0:02:05] woundedslayer: GOOD MORNING STREAMER owoslay
[0:04:21] KassieKalico: kassie20Hey
[0:04:33] woundedslayer: @KassieKalico hi
[0:05:04] KassieKalico: am hungyy
[0:05:13] DebyeLambda: catboyWave
[0:05:29] woundedslayer: @DebyeLambda hi ó €€
[0:05:54] woundedslayer: youre actually getting some recipes in the discord now.
[0:06:08] zihir0: linkzrDab dabbin on them yo chat and linkzr
[0:06:14] KassieKalico: i like that we get more emotes but it's not gonna be relevant for me personally for a while cus i have 9 subs kassie20KEKW
[0:06:24] woundedslayer: @zihir0 yo
[0:07:14] KassieKalico: it's a good start!
[0:07:23] dutch_gecko: can I, umm can, umm, can you, ummm... so... umm... peepoShi
[0:07:37] KassieKalico: mine wants me to play dark souls too but i need a controller
[0:07:55] woundedslayer: @dutch_gecko hi
[0:08:02] dutch_gecko: hiya hi
[0:08:03] KassieKalico: everyone i know says it's much better on controller
[0:08:18] DebyeLambda: yeah, it is made with controller in mind
[0:08:27] KassieKalico: i want one for mortal combat as well so i might as well
[0:08:32] dutch_gecko: there are lots of "controller games" that I've played on MnK because I'm an absolute pepega with gamepads
[0:08:53] DebyeLambda: @KassieKalico funny thing is, a keyboard is more convenient for fighting games
[0:08:56] woundedslayer: dutch i got this for you hope it helps today ðŸ¥„ ðŸ¥„ ðŸ¥„ ðŸ¥„
[0:08:56] KassieKalico: linkzr just buld different
[0:09:16] dutch_gecko: that's odd advice because people spends lots and lots of money on fightsticks so that they don't need to use a gamepad
[0:09:21] dutch_gecko: yeah strive is lovely on keyboard
[0:09:22] KassieKalico: @DebyeLambda i tried it felt so rough D:

[0:10:04] dutch_gecko: I've been building a hitbox for playing strive on, basically it's just mapping a desired keyboard layout to dedicated buttons

[0:32:47] AdeliePenguin94: Hydrate
[0:33:09] AdeliePenguin94: They're little shits
[0:33:14] dutch_gecko: it's usually because they were abandoned by their mom before finished weaning, so they get food insecurity
[0:33:21] dutch_gecko: you can usually train it back out of them
[0:33:23] AdeliePenguin94: My cats will steal things they're not supposed to be eating, look me dead in the eye and bol
[0:33:25] AdeliePenguin94: bolt*
[0:33:51] AdeliePenguin94: They're getting better about it but damn
[0:34:04] AdeliePenguin94: They're all rescues who definitely had food insecurity at some point in their lives
[0:34:16] dutch_gecko: I mean cats will always yoink food

[0:43:05] AdeliePenguin94: Yeah, like at least once a night
[0:43:07] woundedslayer: but now he will be so quiet you will not even know he is there. SadCat
[0:43:15] AdeliePenguin94: And he snores like a chainsaw
[0:43:20] dutch_gecko: that would scare the crap out of me, no wonder
