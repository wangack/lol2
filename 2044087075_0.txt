[7:03:20] abel_k9: Loved at home
[7:03:28] SchoolBoiQue7: i feel like the higher up you go in games the more toxic it gets
[7:03:31] abel_k9: Homeless
[7:03:47] abel_k9: I think people just care more and it builds up
[7:04:08] Danielumalament: @SchoolBoiQue7 its like that
[7:04:18] Saskyylol: ok but , who doesnt do that
[7:04:23] Danielumalament: they get more used to the game and absorb more of its mindset
[7:04:27] hartlessvessl: no get it
[7:04:36] Nightbot: follow my other social medias!! twitter: https://twitter.com/gamergirlgf instagram: https://www.instagram.com/penkiibear/ youtube: https://tinyurl.com/tyequku discord: https://discord.gg/gamergirl

[7:04:43] gdkpgold: kappacino
[7:04:50] abel_k9: Damn he's strong lol wtf
[7:04:54] Danielumalament: so they automatically get as toxic as the rest of the commnity, even if they were not before
[7:05:07] EricGiby: @abel_k9 fuckin s13+14 Jax..
[7:05:17] Nightbot: my accs: https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/na/kitten%20meow%20meow-cat https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/NA/gamer%20girl-pig
[7:05:20] SchoolBoiQue7: @danielumalament yeah true when i hit master on Apex and master in Overwatch, the coms got super toxic and people have crazy inflated egos
[7:06:01] gdkpgold: how about some mercs
[7:06:22] abel_k9: meandyou
[7:06:29] curlythepube: meandyourfeet
[7:06:46] LeeroyJonki: Hello gamer girl gamergirlPleading
[7:06:46] Nightbot: hello bruh gamergirlPleading
[7:06:52] Saskyylol: @abel_k9 pov you look at enemy mid jungle
[7:06:54] SchoolBoiQue7: @danielumalament fighting games are the only exception imo low elo in fighting games is toxic, mashing and spamming and taunting but when you get to high elo everyone gives respect
[7:07:00] LeeroyJonki: @abel_k9 meandyou
[7:07:15] gdkpgold: PepegaChat
[7:07:27] gdkpgold: boots?
[7:07:30] Danielumalament: @SchoolBoiQue7 yeah exactly. And other than ego, when someone gets higher ranks it also means he  invested soooo much more time in the game and takes it way too seriously, so they talk the game's most inside language as if they've become AIs that learned from it
[7:07:32] LeeroyJonki: dvaWalk
[7:07:38] EricGiby: @SchoolBoiQue7 True, and i am a FG player.. The higher you get, the less toxicity there
[7:07:54] abel_k9: Erm
[7:08:04] SchoolBoiQue7: @ericgiby same here man, FG community is awesome.
[7:08:10] LeeroyJonki: SAJ you didn't add any new horny emotes today gamer girl? SAJ
[7:08:19] Saskyylol: oh wait
[7:08:23] Saskyylol: thats a dubn
[7:08:40] gdkpgold: mercs or tabi
[7:08:56] abel_k9: Is the new dragon adc out
[7:09:03] abel_k9: :3
[7:09:11] EricGiby: @SchoolBoiQue7 Yep, and also whenever someone wants to learn or complain about anything, community is always helpful unlike this community which is like ''You are the problem, game is fine. Get gud noob'' etc
[7:09:17] SchoolBoiQue7: @danielumalament facts
[7:09:33] Danielumalament: @EricGiby yeah, fighting games are totally different, i love their community too. I was a Dragonball FighterZ player. The mindset in those games is totally different and there's much more sportivity
[7:09:51] uncreativelamp: i like playing as nunu hes fun
[7:09:55] Danielumalament: I think it's also a 1v1 games thing
[7:10:05] SchoolBoiQue7: @ericgiby yeah thats facts aswell league community is super toxic was introduced to the game in 2016 lol nothings changed
[7:10:13] hartlessvessl: RIP
[7:10:13] vgoght98: gg
[7:10:17] hartlessvessl: gg nt
[7:10:20] curlythepube: AYAYA anime
[7:10:26] uncreativelamp: yeah i think toxicity is normal in games like lol and cod
[7:10:27] LeeroyJonki: massive she said dongerj
[7:10:36] uncreativelamp: i think toxicity is really funny tho
[7:10:39] EricGiby: @Danielumalament It was a great game, i played it a lot. Also it helps that FG is 1v1 so no complains on teammates so it's automatically LESS toxic
[7:10:44] hartlessvessl: YEP hit the 7h mark
[7:10:44] Nightbot: YEP COCK
[7:10:47] hartlessvessl: shift over

[7:10:55] Dexef: degen hours now
[7:10:55] SchoolBoiQue7: @ericgiby thats a big point too fighting game community will help you get better and are down to teach. this game all people do is love to degrade others even there own teammates
