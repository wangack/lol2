[2:10:04] TaeKw0nJ0e: @Darkness_enjoyer you havent seen the buffs or?
[2:10:08] Darkness_enjoyer: I saw them
[2:10:17] Darkness_enjoyer: though, I think it is because enemy has sona
[2:10:21] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream? Follow me on other platforms for more content! https://linktr.ee/jackspektra
[2:10:25] TaeKw0nJ0e: no its cause the buffs are mental
[2:10:26] toms_tomato: confidence is key on this champ
[2:10:32] Tcyy: !addcom !Shadowflame yes jack knows about shadowflame ezreal he thinks it has potential
[2:10:32] Nightbot: @Tcyy -> The command "!shadowflame" has been added successfully.

[2:10:51] Darkness_enjoyer: @TaeKw0nJ0e sona is a champ?
[2:11:31] TaeKw0nJ0e: you listening @Darkness_enjoyer
[2:11:35] Darkness_enjoyer: I am
[2:11:36] MikuChan1998: @TaeKw0nJ0e Sona is good if you have ironically have braincells
[2:11:36] rases00: 100% bAD on W is massive
[2:11:37] son_of_forg1ven: so you max e or w second/.
[2:12:08] Darkness_enjoyer: ezreal is good, buffs are pretty nice to see, but that play wasn't because ezreal was broken
[2:12:12] MikuChan1998: although she does get bursted a lot more now cos theres a lot of dmg around
[2:12:26] inflncr: its always E
[2:13:00] Brogzybro: Well these guys are not having a fun laning phase
[2:13:51] rases00: Not that many good supports in Simbabwe i think
[2:14:26] Sirjacquess: Why essense river and not trinity?
[2:14:30] MikuChan1998: does ez r 1 creep waves now cos of the buffs?
[2:14:50] MikuChan1998: @Sirjacquess ezreal likes a bit of crit for navori
[2:15:02] yusufasar_: when triforce when er @Jackspektra
[2:15:04] MikuChan1998: also ER is a cheaper spike and ezreal's dmg is insane on 1 spike
[2:15:24] yusufasar_: oh they asked ok
[2:15:38] Darkness_enjoyer: I think it is because trinity build lacks the ability haste
[2:15:56] Darkness_enjoyer: the attack speed passive also removed so it is no longer that good
[2:16:03] MikuChan1998: I think the 40% crit navori 3rd angle
[2:16:06] MikuChan1998: makes more sense
[2:16:15] Darkness_enjoyer: navori is good I agree
[2:16:21] MikuChan1998: for the spell damage buff and the cd
[2:16:25] Darkness_enjoyer: but you delay serylda's spike way too much
[2:16:37] MikuChan1998: I dont think seryldas is that good anymore
[2:16:40] Darkness_enjoyer: though not sure if it is no longer that good on ezreal since
[2:16:43] MikuChan1998: maybe just go LDR
[2:16:44] Darkness_enjoyer: @MikuChan1998 yeah
[2:16:45] MikuChan1998: more crit
[2:16:45] yusufasar_: is serylda's even worth
[2:16:48] MikuChan1998: and
[2:17:01] MikuChan1998: LDR makes navori stronger
[2:17:07] MikuChan1998: and helps shred tanks
[2:17:21] ObitoTR: i love u
[2:17:30] Darkness_enjoyer: ldr is definitely better
[2:17:41] Darkness_enjoyer: now that I think about it
[2:17:58] MikuChan1998: the slow is only below 50% hp too
[2:18:05] MikuChan1998: ye the slow loss is sad
[2:18:06] Sirjacquess: ye
[2:18:20] MikuChan1998: but I believe the damage amp from LDR more than compensates
[2:18:42] MikuChan1998: (btw im a supp main, im just theory crafing)
[2:18:48] Sirjacquess: XD
[2:19:05] MikuChan1998: im also a dirty emerald peaker
[2:19:10] gin_41: karma dmg looks very balanced
[2:19:11] MikuChan1998: im dogshit
[2:19:16] MikuChan1998: ye karma is strong
[2:19:17] MikuChan1998: xd
[2:19:22] ShienHersix: do you like the ez milio pair?
[2:19:31] Darkness_enjoyer: well I don't think elo matters much in terms of itemization
[2:19:43] Darkness_enjoyer: I have seen many pros just waste all their gold
[2:19:47] Darkness_enjoyer: in pro games
[2:20:06] ShienHersix: ty. im not the only one then
[2:20:10] 01arian01: does sundered sky work on ez? @Jackspektra
[2:20:49] lolmirai: its an on attack effect so q wouldnt proc it
[2:21:08] Darkness_enjoyer: I think in the future we will see the old frostborne ezreal when the item gets buffed
[2:21:23] Darkness_enjoyer: certainly a riot thing to do imo
[2:21:59] chatarraburrida: Ohhh yes no Jack lucían

[2:23:38] MikuChan1998: sylas is ass tho
[2:23:41] Darkness_enjoyer: but they grief way too much when they int
[2:23:55] MikuChan1998: I mean Shaco is ass too
[2:24:13] Darkness_enjoyer: it is mostly on enemy, sometimes they just don't know how to play against it
[2:24:15] 01arian01: can you try sundered in the practice for the science?
[2:24:58] purke7: why navori?
[2:25:08] MikuChan1998: sundered is not an adc item
[2:25:16] MikuChan1998: Navori buffs your spell damage
[2:25:26] MikuChan1998: and crit ezreal is actually good
[2:25:57] xcalebur: sundered defo has a place on some adcs
[2:26:05] xcalebur: in very niche scenarios
