[1:33:39] CheeseHead1337: There are def some streams that I used to watch that I try to watch for nostalgia.. and I just cant do it. This community is just so positive. No outgrowing positivity
[1:33:41] watson1235: it‚Äôs fun sometimes to watch the old kids shows from when you were younger to catch the jokes they throw in for the parents üòÇ
[1:34:02] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous i see, but america is liberal, so i guess the government want more say in how much they milk from you huh?

[1:41:34] CynicalScrub: it would be awesome if hitboxes matched character models
[1:41:36] littlejellyfishy: headBang headBang
[1:41:38] Azmod3ous: @AllyCaatt Definitely was a unique thing that they had to take away I was so frustrated bc the kept the eternals for it but you couldn't acquire it anymore after rework XD
[1:41:43] jundan: @littlejellyfishy hope you find something you like to do if haven‚Äôt already ^^
[1:41:52] ataraxia78: Tired? u kidding?
[1:41:52] Azmod3ous: @KayPea Keep playlist! It's a vibe!
[1:41:57] AflamingN00B: I was sick of this song 10 years ago and I still am NotLikeThis
[1:42:16] schwartzj4: what would you say the best way to hit asol is? aiming for his head?
[1:42:16] AllyCaatt: @azmod3ous I used to call the flipping ‚Äòget in the van‚Äô xD it was great
[1:42:19] shamneo: then teemo will be broken as hell. hard to hit Kappa
[1:42:31] meep_: Hey Kaypea and chat! I hope that everyone's week is ending well! kaypLove PrideFlower PrideToucan
[1:42:38] iamtonin: it aint a vibe until she plays WORMS BY ASHNIKKO
[1:42:40] AllyCaatt: people would flash away so scared when a voli came charging
[1:42:44] schwartzj4: or is it more just the center of the body?
[1:43:04] Azmod3ous: @AllyCaatt Lmao might as well yell have some candy or get in my basement XD
[1:43:59] Taichou_7: You never grow old. Always beautiful.
[1:44:06] schwartzj4: either way imma miss üòÇ

[1:44:22] Zaridwen: Hi KayPea! Happy Friday
[1:44:26] schwartzj4: @azmod3ous ty
[1:44:32] SilentKiwiSoul: @KayPea Hello sunshine! kaypCozy kaypCozy kaypCozy ^^
[1:44:36] schwartzj4: yeah that def looked like it hit his tail/body
[1:44:40] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous the further form his head you aim, the smaller the hitbox right?
[1:44:42] Azmod3ous: @schwartzj4 When she binds him notice where the pixels are on his body and that should tell you
[1:44:53] daveyCK: I have this song in my semi regular playlist
[1:45:03] Azmod3ous: @FeedTheTank it's looks like the center
[1:45:06] Azmod3ous: I was wrong
[1:45:08] schwartzj4: Tyty I don‚Äôt play against asol too often so I wasn‚Äôt sure
[1:45:34] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous yea
[1:45:45] FeedTheTank: @FeedTheTank center, you were right man
[1:45:48] lewhitehd69: Pog dark cosmic
[1:45:48] AflamingN00B: Asol is such a bad champ design. Having him be large and potions of his body being untargetable was never a good idea.
[1:45:55] lewhitehd69: best skin in the game EZ
[1:46:14] Azmod3ous: @schwartzj4 np it's kinda fun seeing how much you can learn from just observing. I don't play mid I'm a jg/top/supp player
[1:46:16] schwartzj4: NICE
[1:46:19] steelxdawn: WELL PLAYED
[1:46:21] jungl4r: woah

[1:46:33] Zaridwen: Best Lux
[1:46:34] xDrewx: Your ult still goes off in its original position when you flash?! first time I've ever seen that
[1:46:39] ajak636: lmao he tried it
[1:46:44] mrricelo: what‚Äôs uuuppppppp
[1:46:44] atichii: that was a boss ass exit
[1:46:47] Napping_Sab: you flashed but your ult stayed where you were?
[1:46:52] Azmod3ous: @xDrewx Ezreal does it too
[1:46:56] atichii: also this asol doesnt play asol veryy good
[1:47:01] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous i never really paid attention even tho i play against hiim mid :O
[1:47:03] Napping_Sab: oh thanks for the info i didn't know that
[1:47:05] lewhitehd69: i did ratirlMe
[1:47:21] schwartzj4: @azmod3ous I agree! I‚Äôve learned a lot from watching others. it‚Äôs easier to notice more things when I‚Äôm not the one playing.
[1:47:21] xvenix: ult flash on lux is always a what. found it out in aram a while ago
[1:47:45] Azmod3ous: @FeedTheTank Right but it's hard to pay atttention in the heat of the moment bc ur focused on csing and dodging lol
[1:47:45] InTsumiac: haiii kelss
[1:47:56] aty212121: I think that she is 5th best Lux so far by now in the world, 1st amongst the females
[1:48:04] RedCarrie: Hey, any tips what to build for mid lux in this season? :)
[1:48:11] DarkSaionara: hello beautiful people
[1:48:17] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous yea, but still, as long as you hit i don't really care much lmao
[1:48:29] AllyCaatt: kaypHello
[1:48:47] atichii: RedCarrie deathcap
[1:48:49] mrricelo: how much I hate that champ
[1:49:08] AllyCaatt: absol just annoying now
[1:49:14] Azmod3ous: @FeedTheTank True but it helps to observe for instance you know the hit box changes depending on low ground/high ground ye?
[1:49:16] AllyCaatt: asol *
[1:49:29] AflamingN00B: What happened to the stars orbiting Aurelion?
[1:49:31] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous ye
[1:49:43] atichii: AflamingN00B thats long gone
[1:50:09] RedCarrie: Do you like the Malignance item on Lux?
[1:50:11] icyglaceon01: do you play honkai star rail
[1:50:12] AflamingN00B: Well my account has been banned for a long time so I haven't played Kappa
[1:50:18] RedCarrie: or have ypu used it b4?
[1:50:22] schwartzj4: I wish they kept the planets orbiting in the skin as a throw back. even if they don‚Äôt do damage
[1:50:34] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous it helps to keep your head cool and look at the bigger picture and just the fight your in
[1:50:39] atichii: i miss the old asol Q . it was fun to use it
[1:51:05] atichii: PauseChamp
[1:51:10] Azmod3ous: @FeedTheTank do yo have discord? are you in KP's Server?

[1:51:22] atichii: tsm is calling EZ
[1:51:25] eliotxshadowfrost21: very nice steal
[1:51:28] Darkcyter: ayy this song pepeJAM
[1:51:32] SickeningTouchLoL: I don‚Äôt think malignace would be good on lux though cause you want to typically want to  do damage after the ult goes off.
[1:51:33] FeedTheTank: @Azmod3ous yea, i ahve discord, but no i am not in her server. Sadge
[1:51:34] BKrisz: relatable

[2:02:34] watson1235: why they ever made it possible for in game cross team chat in this game is beyond me üòÇ the toxicity is real
[2:02:38] Azmod3ous: @lawfulevil_13 I can't tell you as a top laner how many times I've started off 0/3 and get quiet on my friends and comeback to being like 20/3 lol so satisfying
[2:03:09] garlicbread0220: the way they have rell and asol and asol's basic ability is better than rells entire ultimate
[2:03:09] FreeXe: When he get Rylais it's hard
[2:03:21] melmar98: dmg is the same but it does do a lot
[2:03:24] mrshibasan: You can walk out of it but once he has rylais that will be deadly
[2:03:27] QTwinkyyy: yeah also the fact that it executes as well is kinda BS kaypHUH kaypAwkward

[2:04:38] mrshibasan: @call_me_teaa It has been like this since season `0
[2:04:40] mrshibasan: 10
[2:05:10] call_me_teaa: @mrshibasan idk how season 10 was but it wasnt like this last season lol

[2:06:04] call_me_teaa: you're wrong, sorry
[2:06:11] hPeaches: @call_me_teaa its not, they changed it for this season lol
[2:06:21] call_me_teaa: this aint a mandela effect type of situation
[2:06:25] mrshibasan: mandela effect i guess cause that what i remember please don't fight me I'm sensitive

[2:07:59] QTwinkyyy: They just made it work by reducing the cooldown from 60 to 30 once you have the full item!
[2:08:00] Lunaremis: Hello thereeee
[2:08:15] mrshibasan: @call_me_teaa I have been playing the whole season 10 I remember a game with lux vs an akali akali use that pendant and it had spellshield
[2:08:16] KeenanFreecs: how is that asol tanky?
[2:08:34] mrshibasan: Season 11 too I use it on a ahri game and I got the shield
[2:08:41] Lunaremis: what the 4esh doin
[2:08:47] Lunaremis: Hi @KayPea How are ya
[2:08:55] mrshibasan: @KeenanFreecs The power of Rod of ages
[2:08:56] eliotxshadowfrost21: OK
[2:08:59] reginaphalange00: lol thresh
[2:08:59] Conceal_Dont_Feel: omg and thresh survives
[2:09:05] WaystedMined: Thresh made some amends at the end...
[2:09:06] QTwinkyyy: he was not allowed to hit that hook, it would've been too big of a change for the storyline we're going for here! kaypLOL
[2:09:11] perfectimperfection: That thresh went crazy just now tho minus the hook
[2:09:14] call_me_teaa: @mrshibasan yeah i wasn't playing back in season 10, nor 11, i started playing late season 12 so i can't really talk about it x)
[2:09:14] fearlessterp: idk that thresh made a great play right there
[2:09:46] eliotxshadowfrost21: n then volli shows up to die....lol
[2:09:51] katiediddlebug: that was me yesterday with my lillia balls T_T
[2:10:00] mrshibasan: @call_me_teaa Yeah, as you said you only just discover it on season 12 but it was already sinbce on season 10
[2:10:18] ajak636: he's predicting LUL LUL LUL
[2:10:29] Niomah: Or his ping is real high
[2:10:46] moonalex26: some days ur the windshield others ur the bug
[2:10:48] dedsentry: This ASol is an AHole
[2:10:49] mrshibasan: I played a lot on season 10 so my memory ain't delulu
[2:10:52] call_me_teaa: @mrshibasan "since" implies that it was there the whole time, i built this item many many times and I guarantee you this component did not give the shield, only the full item
[2:11:04] call_me_teaa: at least during season 13
[2:11:21] eliotxshadowfrost21: man ur team needs to stop just running at full hp sol
[2:11:36] moonalex26: brotect the cait
[2:11:39] Lunaremis: I mean the madman survived in the end Lol
[2:11:55] ajak636: is the enemy team not building armor cuz cait's damage is crazy
[2:12:03] katiediddlebug: jezzus christ
[2:12:05] Calleson: hahahah
[2:12:06] Zaguena: selamƒ±n aleykum
[2:12:07] Soliy1: what about a mURRRR
[2:12:09] Calleson: what a thumbs up
[2:12:09] SkottyBones: LOL KP
[2:12:09] Niomah: @mrshibasan It was absolutely not in prior incarnations. Per the patch history: 14.1 New Unique Passive - Annul: Grants a Spell Shield spell shield that blocks the next hostile ability (60 second cooldown, restarts upon taking damage from champions).
[2:12:11] tinynino: leaving u hanging like that
[2:12:12] mrshibasan: @call_me_teaa season 10 is the rework of mythic items and changes of items but whatevs what floats your boat what to believe that's your thing and i have my thing
[2:12:12] Lunaremis: LUL
[2:12:15] meep_: @mrshibasan Hi friend, I've been playing since season 7 and the component never gave the spell shield before this season, let's just all get along now friends kaypHarmony
[2:12:16] SkottyBones: That irl thumbs up
[2:12:20] moonalex26: kaypLOL kaypLOL kaypLOL kaypLOL kaypLOL
[2:12:27] jimbob_ywert: HEY KP
[2:12:34] Efsunludiyar: üëç
[2:12:39] call_me_teaa: @mrshibasan this is not "my thing or your thing tho"... these are just facts
[2:12:41] moonalex26: sadge
[2:12:43] perfectimperfection: That's crazy
[2:12:53] Niomah: And it's not something you believe, it's just actual fact
[2:12:56] jimbob_ywert: nooo I can‚Äôt believe I missed some dark cosmic lux gameplay :(
[2:12:59] eliotxshadowfrost21: ggs
[2:13:06] mrshibasan: @call_me_teaa I'm not trying to argue just saying alright
[2:13:16] Niomah: We can see item history through the years via LoL wiki and Mobafire
[2:13:18] dylanship: Yeah it's like upgraded of Viktor's w
[2:13:19] Lunaremis: Malph just got a boost in the respawn
[2:13:22] pusheencatt1: i think the only counter to the asol pull would be mercurys boots
[2:13:26] call_me_teaa: @mrshibasan well im not trying to argue either x)
[2:13:31] dylanship: upgraded I meant better version
[2:13:37] eliotxshadowfrost21: it was an up and down effort but nice try
[2:14:22] TyrTheTiny: that's so upsetting, let's flame
[2:14:33] Azmod3ous: I'm off for now I got to take a 6 hour trip to see my nephew he found out his fiance stepped out on him. Gl in the rest of your games and have a blessed weekend!
[2:14:36] moonalex26: guilty
[2:14:42] jimbob_ywert: kaypLOL
[2:14:46] eliotxshadowfrost21: the amount of times I watched literally like all of your allies walk head first into full hp asol was wild too @KayPea
[2:14:55] VanillaEssenceLoL: I have to head off to work hope everyone enjoys their Friday evening kaypPengu kaypLove
[2:15:05] ajak636: right and it's mostly top laners ü§∑
[2:15:05] Conceal_Dont_Feel: yeah playing tank engage from behind looks pretty troll
[2:15:28] Ybrek6: he ain't worth the 6 hours lol
[2:15:29] Azmod3ous: <3 <3
[2:15:31] jimbob_ywert: Lux is such a fun champion
[2:15:32] eliotxshadowfrost21: absolute masochist of a team lol
[2:15:40] mrshibasan: whatevs this item is or whatever lets just enjoy stream
[2:15:54] Azmod3ous: @Ybrek6 That's fucked you don't know him or the shit he's been through.
[2:15:55] Lunaremis: I think that most of the people that play aggresively get stuck in a tunnel vision
[2:15:55] mrsparkei: hii chat hii everyone!!! happy friday happy week end @KayPea
[2:16:18] aty212121: What do you guys  think of lux Vs LB match??
[2:16:18] Niomah: I had a super "run it down" feeding Jax in ARAM last night, but I was playing Veigar so I was able to carry.
[2:16:22] moonalex26: part of the problem is that your team [tends to] start flaming you if you get behind and its difficult to not get frustrated with the situation as a whole without just deafening and essentially isolating yourself from the team
[2:16:27] Darkcyter: kaypRonin
[2:16:34] Calleson: haiiiii
[2:16:34] TyrTheTiny: Lucas is streaming, you could play together, so romantic
[2:16:43] QTwinkyyy: @mrshibasan not trying to argue but you can check out league item wiki to see the patch history on the item to be sure! kaypFlower
[2:16:43] eliotxshadowfrost21: having an attitude from minute 1 like that is the difference maker in whether or not the game is winnable after that triple kill in dragon pit.
[2:16:44] iBexi: courtillyRudolph Good vibes coming your way for a win. courtillyWiggle
[2:16:46] mrsparkei: can we see the catttt? pleaseee
[2:16:47] Ybrek6: @Azmod3ous I apologize, I only heard kay say the 6 hour trip. I didn't read the full message until now
[2:16:49] Darkcyter: kaypFreya cozying under her box has my heart
[2:16:50] Gangsta_Elf: kaypRonin
[2:16:50] jimbob_ywert: what do you think about the new rune changes?
[2:17:00] stfencurry: Ôºå Ôºå

[2:18:16] CynicalScrub: i want a didiot emote plzzz
[2:18:20] katiediddlebug: u lookin comfy af today Kels
[2:18:20] jimbob_ywert: I HATE THIS GAME (RAWR)
[2:18:21] ajak636: the goose anivia
[2:18:22] mrshibasan: emote XD
[2:18:23] Niomah: Let's GO KP! RAAAAWR!
[2:18:23] mrshibasan: LMAO
[2:18:24] moonalex26: yeah verdant didnt give the shield last season - gave you scaling MR based on minion kills, kind of like old seekers arm brace
[2:18:24] witaine: witaine subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 2 month streak! hi kp have you tried karma mid? shes kinda broken now with buffs and have a great stream <3
[2:18:27] mrshibasan: Sorry
[2:18:29] Darkcyter: facepalm would have a lot of applications
[2:18:30] Sunnytinker: lets gooooo (roar)
[2:18:31] Darkcyter: @witaine WB
[2:18:36] watson1235: exactly like you did earlier after the win flex and ROAR
[2:18:41] darkchicken123: where did u meet your friend. Online dating or in a club or something? Im trtying to find a new girlfriend
[2:18:49] katiediddlebug: "it means I love you in dinosaur UwU"
[2:18:50] iBexi: nickiEvil we will get this win, I can feel it in my bones
[2:19:07] TyrTheTiny: @katiediddlebug jail time
[2:19:08] Darkcyter: This bruiser damage kaypFacepalm, weekend games kaypFacepalm, wtf is this season kaypFacepalm
[2:19:11] jimbob_ywert: Karma is so broken support, mid she gets countered
[2:19:19] Niomah: Karma's utterly broken. In a 35 min ARAM I did 105K damage
[2:19:21] katiediddlebug: @TyrTheTiny I deserve that lmao
[2:19:36] QTwinkyyy: maybe a picture of Freya roaring but just an idea
[2:20:00] jimbob_ywert: Why is decided on a new emote harder than winning a game behind as lux
[2:20:08] iBexi: platyJAM
[2:20:09] eliotxshadowfrost21: YESSSS
[2:20:13] eliotxshadowfrost21: omg ]
[2:20:17] witaine: lets go ahwii
[2:20:21] arcadedani: kaypCreep  yes!
[2:20:26] Goriyay: AYEEEE AHRI
[2:20:34] AflamingN00B: Yon√©?
[2:20:40] Goriyay: ive been seeing so many lich ahris lately! thoughts?
[2:20:46] ajak636: i heard lich bane is good on ahri is it true?
[2:20:50] mrshibasan: what a coinsidence I'm playing ahri with kda all out skin too
[2:20:59] Goriyay: @ajak636 we think the samelol
[2:21:11] Goriyay: tear into lich is what ive seen peeps do lately
[2:21:14] jimbob_ywert: spirit blossom AHRI game?
[2:21:20] KrakenstainMx: hi kp
[2:21:23] mrshibasan: because they ban luxxxx
[2:21:26] AflamingN00B: Hearthsteel Ahri would be cool. Her dmg would be so low she'd basically heal the enemy Kappa
[2:21:28] mrshibasan: my team banned lux
[2:21:28] nixban: heyy there
[2:21:39] AllyCaatt: trying to pop in and out when I can work is crazy :(
[2:21:45] TyrTheTiny: it's ok, show that horrible new mage, what a real mage is like
[2:21:47] lovelyangelxoxo: Hello! bakefaCeUwUDANCE wrecke18BROHITTINIT
[2:22:01] bariskiran: x
[2:22:09] bariskiran: !followage
[2:22:09] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[2:22:09] Goriyay: ye then finish archangels
[2:22:10] QTwinkyyy: What I've seen is people do corrupting pot into building Luden's and lich bane after it seems to be doing quite well
[2:22:14] ajak636: oh i basically said the same thing i just noticed LUL
[2:22:15] jimbob_ywert: Hwei is buffed and now super OP LATE
[2:22:34] meep_: I mean, he's been buffed like every patch since he came out. As a Hwei player, I love it kaypSip
[2:22:46] eliotxshadowfrost21: santorins hot take on how riot chooses who to buff in yesterdays stream was hilariously accurate
[2:23:03] iBexi: I believe in you, KP. I believe in you. tokkiShy
[2:23:17] AflamingN00B: Isn't Hwei the name of a chinese phone company?
[2:23:17] jimbob_ywert: Hwei is the aphelios of mid, unnecessary buffs because ppl suck at him
[2:23:30] Niomah: I think the consensus is "Not selling enough skins, make him more OP"
[2:23:35] iBexi: I just repeated myself.  I'm not with it today. tokkiREE
[2:23:47] meep_: @AflamingN00B that's huawei, but it's very close kaypLOL
[2:24:18] stfencurry: „ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ
[2:24:20] moonalex26: started playing ranked yesterday [from completely unranked] it is surprising the amount of skill difference just at the bottom tier
[2:24:25] Jazzoholic: i love the hwei buff ^^
[2:24:30] TyrTheTiny: what a start
[2:24:37] Jazzoholic: slowly but surely becoming a hwei main <3
[2:24:52] mrshibasan: idk what game im playing enemies champs are all over the place
[2:25:03] meep_: @Jazzoholic same here friend! got my first S on him a few days ago! kaypH5
[2:25:08] bemyresset: I was so excited for this season but it looks like we are just going back to tank/bruiser meta as always
[2:25:20] bemyresset: mages can‚Äôt even get 1 month to be relevant
[2:25:22] Goriyay: istg autoing on ahri does negative dmg- drives me insane every time i play her
[2:25:28] Jazzoholic: @meep_ niiiice! i'm one token away from lvl 6 :D
[2:25:30] moonalex26: @bemyresset thats cuz they didnt change the meta just items and map
[2:25:43] bemyresset: yeah
[2:25:45] eliotxshadowfrost21: that riot just goes to op.gg and just picks worst win rate champions and doesnt even look at why the wr is bad. he had quite the tangent on the garen buffs
[2:26:18] meep_: @Jazzoholic oh nice! I'm still really low mastery on him because I only really play ARAMs, but I love him kaypCozy
[2:26:33] Jazzoholic: playlist is fire @KayPea ^^
[2:26:34] ajak636: watched lck earlier and k'sante and udyr were duking it out and neither of their hp bars moved lol
[2:27:03] Niomah: Pretty sure the apocalypse is upon us. I got an S on SHACO in ARAM the other day. I've touched that champ maybe twice in 2 years.
[2:27:06] Niomah: 10 years even
[2:27:19] Fippscity: What's up fam! It's been a while
[2:27:52] iBexi: It's bad when you try to communicate that your mid is going bot and people die to him tokkiFine
[2:28:00] jimbob_ywert: LICH is super OP
[2:28:05] Goriyay: ^^
[2:28:17] bemyresset: I thought lich bane was nerfed? or is that next patch
[2:28:28] tinycaptain304: I watched an ahri the other day do lich and then shurelya's second
[2:28:29] TomNova: kaypFlower  hai everyone, hope you're having a great friday. Havent played in a while, how do you find the new champ, hwei ?
[2:29:21] melmar98: its so obnoxious
[2:29:37] TurtleIam: i played this match up yesterday, went well
[2:29:38] TomNova: looks like they have aloooot of abilities to deal with like aphelios
[2:29:50] jimbob_ywert: prediction?
[2:29:55] katiediddlebug: the playlist is FIRE today
[2:30:52] jimbob_ywert: OK THE DODGE QUEEN
[2:30:56] TomNova: the jukes! haha that was awesome
[2:31:00] ajak636: fancy feet

[2:37:41] mrshibasan: I love you
[2:37:47] AzogDaAussie: @LittleMoxie midlane in particlar got big changes, feels super wide now
[2:38:25] TomNova: @LittleMoxie yeah i think so! looks wider on bot side :O
[2:39:08] TomNova: LUL
[2:39:15] TomNova: got them cannon minions tho
[2:39:21] LittleMoxie: birdofYum
[2:39:44] NoPainNoDane: How are you pinging so fast? do you have pin set to a certain button?
[2:40:02] czvitcz: Briar is such a stupid champ man xd
[2:40:19] TomNova: that healing is crazy
[2:40:35] lexaxel: hey kayy have a nice stream < 3<3 <3

[2:41:08] LittleMoxie: oh, nice birdofChirps
[2:41:37] TomNova: does your charm interrupt her like auto lock thing?
[2:41:41] kingdomofblue: briar is scary when she comes running at you like a lunatic
[2:42:58] TomNova: still gottem tho so
[2:43:02] Shalino43: @LittleMoxie from gw2?
[2:43:03] TomNova: yeaaaa
[2:43:12] pusheencatt1: wall was thicc
[2:43:18] TomNova: it was alll part of the plan, fake them out
[2:43:34] Terhadalas: focus on the ult over the wall, ok got it
[2:43:44] AzogDaAussie: the healing :O
[2:43:46] schwartzj4: oh that healing is bs
[2:43:47] dylanship: lol the heal
[2:43:47] czvitcz: xd
[2:43:50] TomNova: dammm
[2:43:54] AzogDaAussie: really need oblivion orb
[2:44:00] Kilava: nice champ riot lol
[2:44:01] Terhadalas: what the groveling f***
[2:44:02] Leaskk: balanced
[2:44:10] TomNova: got like a quarter of her hp
[2:44:12] TomNova: or more
[2:44:15] czvitcz: She is perma ban for me xd
[2:44:20] Zaridwen: I had the same reaction
[2:44:27] TomNova: and i thought WW was bad
[2:44:39] hydroh0mie07: I never did figure out how Briar works
[2:45:01] LittleMoxie: @Shalino43 have tried it but haven't invested any time in gw2, how come you ask? PrideFloat
[2:45:04] TomNova: healing cut needs to be better
[2:45:14] ajak636: i hate how they removed chemtech purifier
[2:45:22] vves24: vves24 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! Yo-Yo!
[2:45:30] Jaketin8: Bruiser healing still on that massive bs, riot dev team needs their early season climb up i guess, like im honestly starting to truly believe that riot dev/executive team is just full of bruiser players hard stuck breaking them on purpose to climb
[2:45:39] Leaskk: there should be aura items in this game, IE while in range healing is reduced by a percent these items wouldnt stack
[2:45:40] Shalino43: @LittleMoxie Aah well, then wrong moxie :P
[2:45:56] Darkcyter: @vves24 WB

[2:47:12] vves24: IM almost emerald in flux! and starting my solo QQ again in 2 years
[2:47:20] weareblob: you also ignited her..
[2:47:31] Galetea: @Leaskk its blow a kiss, fire a gun
[2:47:33] LittleMoxie: @Shalino43 ah, I see PrideLaugh
[2:47:42] jimbob_ywert: THAT ASHE WAS CLEAN
[2:47:45] exorc157: and even if you kill her she has Zilean to ult her kaypFreya
[2:47:46] Leaskk: oh lol
[2:47:48] TomNova: what does she have ? like items
[2:47:48] TyrTheTiny: I like this Ashe
[2:48:00] watson1235: what was he thinking lol
[2:48:03] TomNova: dam
[2:48:33] SkottyBones: I hate that champ
[2:48:34] RadiantWisp: woah
[2:48:37] whiteking445: Gg
[2:48:55] jimbob_ywert: this briar?
[2:48:56] rustyroo18: hwei ult on 4 second cooldown?
[2:49:07] LittleMoxie: birdofBlank
[2:49:09] watson1235: they are literally like running in one by one
[2:49:15] Galetea: ap cooldown ashe
[2:49:21] Shalino43: @LittleMoxie ;D
[2:49:24] Sunnytinker: ap cooldown
[2:49:25] Jaketin8: Anti heal never should have been nerfed, there is nothing anyone can do to change my mind on that, nerfing anti heal while allowing healing like that briar bs healing, is the most anti balancing thing riot could have done
[2:49:30] rustyroo18: just saw that man ult 3 times in like 30 seconds
[2:49:34] jimbob_ywert: yeah sadly Hwei just dominates team fights in late. his ult is BROKEN
[2:49:37] TyrTheTiny: is just CD ashe with liandry to burn with each W
[2:49:40] TomNova: ohhh its the spam W ashe build yeah
[2:49:40] TyrTheTiny: not really ap
[2:49:51] Galetea: spam her abilities and ult i do it a lot as ashe lmao
[2:49:55] TomNova: it just procs the mandate all the time
[2:49:55] pandora285: pandora285 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months! heeeeey
[2:50:04] NoPainNoDane: i think they need a antiheal item that reduces lifesteal rather then support heals, i think thats what they are scared about to make supp more useless
[2:50:38] SkottyBones: It's like Nasus and Kayle though. When they get to late game it feels pointless
[2:50:46] Galetea: I wish theyd revert Hwei, i feel people who actually figured out how to play him got to make him OP, but now with his buff everyone just plays him
[2:51:21] RadiantWisp: LUL
[2:51:29] TheStorySoFar69: !socials

[2:51:52] TomNova: or better to try and burst her ?
[2:52:00] Galetea: shadow
[2:52:05] Leaskk: you need a team
[2:52:13] CipherAdminShady: void
[2:52:19] ajak636: void i think
[2:52:22] rustyroo18: actually feeling like midlane ap is struggling this season, feel like all my ap champs are just "eh"
[2:52:29] Goriyay: would crypt be good for the heal too
[2:52:39] Byggareebob: its never void. if you want void you go cryptbloom
[2:52:43] TomNova: she does have the spirat so void i probs solid
[2:53:01] TheStorySoFar69: this song always reminds me of twilight
[2:53:04] luminosity_light: Crypt is better than void, you only lose 4 damage and it heals with assists and kills
[2:53:17] rustyroo18: yeah was just about to say, oh are we about to play baseball in a thunderstorm?
[2:53:27] Goriyay: ^^^
[2:53:38] TheStorySoFar69: aye lol @rustyroo18
[2:53:52] Galetea: Yeah if fiora stayed with yall she'd be spooky but she's dying alone

[2:57:59] AzogDaAussie: @eliotxshadowfrost21 so true kaypLUL
[2:58:02] Galetea: I listened to Supermassive Blackhole a lot before Twilight and I was like "Man now people are gonna think i liked it just bc of the movie"
[2:58:05] TomNova: i think actors have the same feeling too when they do lots of different movies but theyre always asked about that one movie over and over
[2:58:05] Timeundr: 37 seconds to kill tham
[2:58:08] xDrewx: All Star from Shrek Kappa
[2:58:10] arcadedani: yes!!!
[2:58:10] watson1235: glass animals heat waves slaps but I hate the sound now because of TikTok
[2:58:14] sir_coughy: You're 1000 gold richer POGGERS
[2:58:47] S17Master: Haaaiii basement
[2:58:49] eliotxshadowfrost21: @AzogDaAussie so many damn bangers in that list but thats all i hear when the songs are playing is "oh thats from the guardians of the galaxy!!!" and im like NOOOOOOO
[2:59:14] NoPainNoDane: Legit half of doja cat is known for tik tok and im like :(
[2:59:16] Galetea: Love Robert Pattinson branching out and doing stuff like Batman and being a gremlin in the voice booth for The Boy and the Heron
[2:59:16] AzogDaAussie: Great songs, great movies, but yes the default attribution is frustrating

[3:09:19] watson1235: welcome to emerald! lol
[3:09:23] AzogDaAussie: to be fair, it was a 100 kill game, it's normal that some players are gonna rack up a lot of deaths
[3:09:44] stefansimplyy: most toxic game ever made
[3:09:47] ivystars: tbh, running towards a teammate is instincts, cause you want help, but yeah.... it was unfortunate
[3:09:49] stefansimplyy: hahaha
[3:10:16] luminosity_light: You dont know how much they are losing tho. Now riot takes your kda into account, so im assuming you lost less than fiora and lucian
[3:10:17] watson1235: CHOPEA!!!

[3:12:25] TyrTheTiny: the magic of liandry
[3:12:29] Leaskk: thats why i ban her and MF everygame now
[3:12:55] milorambaldi87: The perma CC from Ashe makes laning in bot seem unplayable.

[3:13:41] aty212121: KAPOW
[3:13:45] Sonje: I did
[3:13:46] DumbleDank1337: what is better is when Riot think "hmmm lets make the most annoying over the top kitted out champs" so we have to deal with them, AKA Briar, Hwei etc. etc.
[3:14:00] TomNova: yep, you get that one really good game and then its like ok free trial over, heres some bad games
[3:14:09] Sonje: 4 loses in a row after promoting in div
[3:14:20] ObsceneSanity: i heard that theres a mmr test on promotion to emerald or diamond to test if you belong
[3:14:25] IscottishgamerI: I'm forever gold, will never know that feeling sadge
[3:14:48] stefansimplyy: we need time when perma ban zed was thing üòÇ
[3:15:01] stefansimplyy: that time was golden compared to now
[3:15:02] markella_andri: Hello kaypHello
[3:15:05] Leaskk: they want to keep you addicted to the "grind"
[3:15:06] SkottyBones: MMR needs to go
[3:15:21] Bigboom789: and losing 25
[3:15:24] TomNova: you go from losing a little bit of lp per game from losing so much a game so its like, the win doesnt even help
[3:15:27] Frozenfruit13: isn‚Äôt 23 normal?
[3:15:32] Frozenfruit13: I usually get 23-25
[3:15:55] J_to_the_jf: the bullshit thing to is you get like +10lp but LOSE 20lp for a loss LUL
[3:15:58] catastrofia: KP!!!!!!!!!! <3
[3:16:01] beabeagorilla: they should 100% take your letter grade into account, just like Valorant
[3:16:01] SkottyBones: You should see it in TFT. It's wild how you get wrekt because of MMR
[3:16:04] markella_andri: I was getting 13 and I lose 30 lol
[3:16:07] ragtimediddly: Just do what I do, lose 25lp and gain 0lp because I never win
[3:16:33] catastrofia: catastrofia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months, currently on a 49 month streak! Hola KP! It's been a minute! Hope you're doing well! Thanks for being positive always!!!!! <3 <3
[3:16:57] dookyhead24: okie dokes time to hop into ranked for the first time. wish me luck
[3:17:11] Martybggg: i think this season Riot changed it so players dont have negative lp gain/loss ratio, f.e + 23 -28. But I am not sure if it really works atm
[3:17:42] catastrofia: I'm great! Just been working ALL THE TIME!
[3:17:43] ObsceneSanity: @Martybggg if youre on a winning streak the mmr shifts. its still the same if youre losing
[3:17:44] Teekwan: Top Pea, letsgooo
[3:17:45] Darkcyter: @catastrofia kaypHYPERS WB
[3:17:47] milorambaldi87: I'm definitely not the best at the game, but it is frustrating to have a game where I go 21/3 and still lose LP because you get teammates with brain damage
[3:17:49] YamiCF: has that graves bug been fixed yet?
[3:17:50] AllyWayz: they really need to take rating into account like if i get an S and lose that should count for something
[3:17:52] Tabster1TV: Hows ya day peeps & @KayPea
[3:17:54] watson1235: CHOPEA RETURNS! REVENGE OF THE CHOPEA!

[3:20:14] jimbob_ywert: You can try Ornn too. super simple and fun
[3:20:18] TomNova: a minion a day keeps the riot doctors away
[3:20:37] gigachadgodsu: OMG. What a selfless Queen wanting to tank your team's stupidity. preachh mama!
[3:21:04] xvenix: i  thought they did that or still working on it?
[3:21:14] Grumplemints: Personal performance should mitigate how much LP you lose, agreed
[3:21:15] AzogDaAussie: yes it's a team game, but there are ways to mitigate how much you as an individual are contributing to a loss
[3:21:16] IoSonoBatman: Yep that will improve people since they will do Better, but someone can go AFK to save the score
[3:21:17] AllyWayz: they track everything too, like vision score and progression these are all things that can be accounted for
[3:21:19] milorambaldi87: But sometimes it is.... honestly lol. If you feed and you're 0-7 in the first 12 minutes and fed a briar or a yi, it sort of is your fault the team loses lol
[3:21:45] agentmilo1: totally agree
[3:21:47] TomNova: i feel that, the struggle is real
[3:22:05] TomNova: objective control, vision, map dominance the works
[3:22:08] ragtimediddly: people KS anyway
[3:22:26] BasFisken: @KayPea Riot are making mmr being skill based
[3:22:44] AllyWayz: it would encourage people to play even when they feel like its a lose
[3:22:47] J_to_the_jf: kda means almost NOTHING in this game people freaking out about ksing is beyond me
[3:22:57] AllyWayz: because they have a chance to not lose as hard
[3:23:10] ragtimediddly: the other solution is for riot to just make the matchmaking not a complete pile of course
[3:23:16] IoSonoBatman: Why changed the song before the drop? BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[3:23:16] NoPainNoDane: believers win
[3:23:18] NoPainNoDane: lol
[3:23:23] watson1235: VICTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[3:23:25] TomNova: so we win ? LUL
[3:23:36] AllyWayz: can we get riot in this chat rn
[3:23:37] NoPainNoDane: ;c
[3:23:43] AllyWayz: kp stream fixing probkems here
[3:23:55] watson1235: I didn‚Äôt get chopea üò≠
[3:24:07] watson1235: santorinSad
[3:24:42] mrshibasan: welp im 2-2
[3:24:57] mrshibasan: last 2 games junglers were shit feeding enemies
[3:25:13] MrCackle: how they fired most the lec production staff? and no idea how itll run this week?
[3:25:14] WaystedMined: Riot has like one observer still employed at the LEC
[3:25:20] yukkur1: hello good morning
[3:25:23] eliotxshadowfrost21: LEC getting the NA treatment?
[3:25:32] mrshibasan: what lec?
[3:25:34] angelofdeathjonathan: Nope didn't hear about the LEC, but LCS only has 8 teams this year
[3:25:39] KSnOwnage: Sjokz going to be casting, observing, interviewing, and hosting! monkaS
[3:25:49] J_to_the_jf: I mean to be fair Riot is losing so much money and I give it 2 years before they sell again
[3:25:59] mrshibasan: wow
[3:26:07] mrshibasan: that'ss uhhhhhh a lot they fired
[3:26:11] katiediddlebug: sjokz and broxah gonna hold it down through sheer willpower lmao
[3:26:13] IscottishgamerI: Gonna be a some watch this weekend, damn
[3:26:19] S17Master: Wait, they even fired personnel for the esports side of things?
[3:26:25] meep_: And didn't Riot say they wanted to focus more on esports?? Make it make sense
[3:26:28] TyrTheTiny: with all this money loss they'll probably release arcane 2 early to try to monetize from it
[3:26:36] eliotxshadowfrost21: @KayPea LEC has constant 70k viewership and riot thinks they dont make enough money and need layoffs? HOW THO???
[3:26:42] pusheencatt1: riot registrates man things from a game (damage intake/output, healing, etc). what if they  would make a point system out of it? the better you do ingame according to the analytics, the more lp you get. must say, that would be quite difficult to balance.
[3:26:57] J_to_the_jf: you would think making the game better would be prio one not another champ and ten more skins KEKW
[3:27:02] xBoomShotBaby: kaypLOL
[3:27:15] MojoXan: you look amazing today :)
[3:27:21] MrCackle: @J_to_the_jf they fired the guy who made smolder also
[3:27:36] hydroh0mie07: I don't really think money is just the reason for all the layoffs... It's super easy for us as outsiders to base it on just greed though in my opinion
[3:27:41] ObsceneSanity: @J_to_the_jf That was wild.
[3:28:04] S17Master: @hydroh0mie07 The statement they released made it sound like money is major factor
[3:28:05] Kuraikko: why did they fire so many people?
[3:28:26] ObsceneSanity: @Kuraikko game industry is in a correction after covid influx
[3:28:34] eliotxshadowfrost21: ok @KayPea gonna switch you to my ipad to tear my setup apart and re configure! gonna go into lurk mode
[3:28:34] krobylos: MrDestructoid
[3:28:36] ragtimediddly: Lots of video game and tech companies are facing loads of layoffs because of overhiring during COVID
[3:28:38] Frozenfruit13: gaming industry boomed during Covid, now profits aren‚Äôt as high
[3:28:41] jimbob_ywert: they fired lots of people because of COVID
[3:28:44] Oakley85: That system is based off how you rank against other people playing the same champ you are though. Definitely a starting point but would need some major reworks for sure
[3:28:46] AllyWayz: also gaming went cray during covid and now people are back to work
[3:28:53] redtauro: what if AIs start streaming games? Monkas
[3:28:55] hydroh0mie07: Now I imagine money IS a part of it, but I have to think there is more. There's this guy Necrit who made a video on it, sort of explaining both sides and many angles. I find it kinda enlightening so I recommend
[3:28:57] katiediddlebug: how did I fucking know your bot was gonna be a vayne lol, they're so goddamn weird
[3:29:12] AllyWayz: theres less time for people to play and invest their money into it and so too much over highering during covid
[3:29:12] arcadedani: i got to say that in general the videogame industry is having a hard time...so things like this is something we all should expect and is probably going to get worse
[3:29:18] ObsceneSanity: the industry boomed when everyone was home. but now no one is home so a correction is in plce. i lost my job from it. its been cool
[3:29:23] IXFeathers: wait ghost cleanse nami, i have a bad feeling about this
[3:29:24] J_to_the_jf: they're cooking their books on the number of players joining the game and playing on a daily bases they're basing that on how many accounts there are NOT how many are new players vs how many are just another smurf
[3:29:26] MrCackle: disco nami?
[3:29:28] pusheencatt1: hmm i thought that maybe some champions or roles would outperform others. like a supp might get less points than a midlaner.
[3:30:01] ragtimediddly: Didn't Blizzard fire all their artists and designers for Overwatch yesterday or today?
[3:30:09] ragtimediddly: like... the only thing that was consistently good about that game?
[3:30:11] bluesiies: dark cosmic lux time? kaypComfy
[3:30:12] slothlane: uh oh the bot lane chat is looking a little stressful
[3:30:29] S17Master: @ObsceneSanity My issue with it is that they all knew eventually things would return to normal so they could have planned better, so we're not seeing literal thousands of people losing their jobs in the span of a few months
[3:30:34] hydroh0mie07: It was a majority of designers and artists, but not just them
[3:30:47] mrshibasan: Also sorry for the person I just argue, I am so deeply sorry
[3:30:53] k0t10n: i cant with these bronze creatures. they keep ffing my games 24 7 even though i can carry
[3:30:59] ObsceneSanity: i know the team that was making the new blizzard mmo was fired and the game is getting cancelled as a tax write off
[3:31:01] hydroh0mie07: Somewhere on reddit there is a list, it's so sad
[3:31:13] Kuraikko: AI is taking our jobs!!
[3:31:16] DumbleDank1337: i ditched overwatch after they decided to bait with the pve and then just axe it, seemed sus to me they baited like that just to make it f2p and add nutty MTX with old skins
[3:31:29] SkottyBones: it's the heads of coorporations that are ruining everything
[3:31:36] SkottyBones: they make too much money and are too greedy
[3:31:51] AzogDaAussie: good start LUL
[3:31:54] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity yeah. it sucks that the people that made the decision to overhire arent the ones also getting punished
[3:31:55] WaystedMined: Wait, wasn't the Blizzard game everyone was fired from a battle royal?
[3:32:11] jimbob_ywert: I‚Äôm RANKED?
[3:32:13] jimbob_ywert: in*
[3:32:17] mookyttv: a lot of the blizzard firings are due to redundant positions between microsoft and blizz after the merger.  they cancelled the survival game they were working on.
[3:32:33] Divine_Lady: !followage
[3:32:33] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[3:32:36] k0t10n: that s some bronze behaviour
[3:32:43] AzogDaAussie: @DumbleDank1337 the lowest effort sequel game ever released, what a disappointment
[3:32:53] ObsceneSanity: yeah a lot of community managers were let go. msft has their own already
[3:33:00] hydroh0mie07: I find it terrifying that so many companies had huge layoffs all within the same month
[3:33:03] redtauro: I wonder if Riot will also stop working on the Fighting games they have been working on
[3:33:11] patjemossttv: heyy kp
[3:33:24] ObsceneSanity: @redtauro I know LoR lost their team
[3:33:28] k0t10n: tf is broken this game is gonna be interesting

[3:33:43] redtauro: @ObsceneSanity PepeHands I was so excited about the fighting game
[3:33:52] slothlane: maybe predictions on the bot lane? LOL
[3:34:37] mookyttv: you knew the ones typing the most would be the feeding lane
[3:35:27] bluesiies: oh that did not just happen
