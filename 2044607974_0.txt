[0:04:47] Fengojo: yeah it makes no sense...
[0:05:02] Fengojo: she's prob using me for attention or doing some manipulation crap lol
[0:05:15] ttempoh: does she reschedule or no?
[0:05:22] Fengojo: dating and girls is honestly the hardest thing for me lol. ur lucky u found someone great long-term early on
[0:05:25] ProfessorPB21: hi bobby
[0:05:26] Nightbot: ProfessorPB21 welcome to bob's crib :)
[0:06:13] Fengojo: @ttempoh she suggests something vague like "let's do next week instead" but i'm usually the one who has to suggest specific days/times, which she agrees to, then again cancels last min
[0:06:29] samyb38: Where you been? Why the late stream
[0:06:40] Fengojo: sometimes she will proactively message me again after a while like "yo let's hangout this weekend" then also cancel last minute lol
[0:06:43] jotnepro123: Ór just be however you want, if she doesnt want anything then it wasnt the right girl for you easy as that
[0:06:43] kherlen511_: no cam today?
[0:07:36] Fengojo: @bobqinxd i met her in person at a karaoke event (at our school) and we chatted for 3 hours and hit it off well in person, so it's not online dating lol

[0:11:57] Fengojo: @bobqinxd i dont think she's dating multiple guys cause she's going through the PhD app grind and working 24/7, but that's still not an excuse imo?
[0:12:05] Fengojo: she told our mutual friend she's not "proactively looking" cause of PhD apps though, but idk why she keeps asking me out
