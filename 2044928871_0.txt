[0:53:45] domikz11: when I was in CHina
[0:53:55] domikz11: I think Chinese is harder since it's fundamentally different
[0:54:26] domikz11: I see people with undergrad degrees in chinese but they are not all the way there (e.g., to understand news)
[0:54:47] domikz11: I think watch chinese shows might help you keep being interested
[0:56:25] domikz11: i watched your teemo streams for a few months now but didn't know you're so good at chinese!

[1:52:38] trombonator420: @ipav999 btw i noticed that sudden impact works with stealth and gives a good amound of magic pen, maybe can use it for early game?
[1:53:15] TheLandShark_: fair fair
[1:53:32] TheLandShark_: lmao pissed off 1 comment my b
[1:54:01] dosomethingffs: anyone not being pissed off by such a comment has some brain problem
[1:55:17] dosomethingffs: i mean, we saw that orrn dealt more damage than BelVeth :D  in objective numbers, that should say enough
[1:55:20] trombonator420: @TheLandShark_ well you basically call him a whiny bitch lol
[1:56:33] binhowz22: hello
[1:56:44] trombonator420: @ipav999 btw i noticed that sudden impact works with stealth and gives a good amound of magic pen, maybe can use it for burst taimo?
[1:57:10] binhowz22: !opgg
[1:59:35] belaruski_ninja_spy: maybe lane bushes
[2:00:39] trombonator420: well the buff  lasts 5 seconds
[2:00:41] belaruski_ninja_spy: you get it for 5 seconds
[2:00:47] belaruski_ninja_spy: so you can walk up and stuff
[2:02:31] luminus_sol: i always go to all in... then i die
[2:02:51] luminus_sol: lmao
[2:03:00] luminus_sol: work till emerald, then it just doesn`t work anymore
[2:03:06] trombonator420: @ipav999 gonna try and take it into matchups that require lvl 1 cheese, pta is gonna be magic damage with dRing
[2:03:06] DontFeedPenguins: did someone preorder something to get that new champ since its not even out yet
[2:03:22] belaruski_ninja_spy: isnt gold fun can just all in and almost win sometimes
[2:03:27] Gooding523: new champ is live
[2:04:09] luminus_sol: teemo is so fun
[2:05:03] Gooding523: are you r1 teemo player ?
[2:05:43] luminus_sol: i play the teemo in botlane, got like 67% winrate till emerald, than it drops to 60%... still working actually
[2:06:16] Gooding523: @luminus_sol  are you playing supp?
[2:06:18] trombonator420: @luminus_sol you go as adc or support? any perticularly hard matchups?
[2:06:36] luminus_sol: @Gooding523 @trombonator420 Support guys, always got flamed for it... but it`s so fun, can`t stop
[2:07:45] luminus_sol: i know that my playstyle is not very optimized... i just love to troll adc in botlane KEKW
[2:08:02] Draenom: I mean if you still enjoy playing the one champ you can spend the time needed. It's a game for fun after all
[2:08:19] luminus_sol: when i really want to win, i go for Thresh and destroy enemy botlane
[2:10:16] Gooding523: I play brand or zyra and spoon feed adcs
[2:11:40] luminus_sol: the only way i know how to carry this game... i play a bully support like Thresh, Zyra, and destroy enemy botlane. So they go afk or tilt, and we win. If the enemy team give up, if they're good, it's a problem.
[2:13:37] Belial_Shax: Who is faby or whatever that name is
[2:13:39] HigameR4771: LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign LuvSign
[2:25:32] Belial_Shax: Cho is so outdated,the only OG champ that hasn't been reworked

[2:40:35] fearshad0w: woahhhh
[2:40:47] fearshad0w: the solo kill
[2:40:51] Dazzelem: a rioter made a video saying that zed is intentionally kept weak because he’s “the most banned and frustrating champion in the game”
[2:40:59] 18cmsoft: just because they actually have to use their brain rather than sit back w q with ravenous perma clearing waves
[2:41:04] Dazzelem: but then they buffed him this patch so
[2:41:07] Dazzelem: there goes that
[2:41:30] itsgafner: I like this map because you could put shrooms on all the little bard chimes lol
[2:41:46] fearshad0w: if zed gets the tiniest buff he'll be god tier, in the right hands zed is a menance
[2:42:40] Naatax: Assasins are too strong atm because lethality changes
[2:42:44] 18cmsoft: tank items ipavZZZ
[2:42:53] Naatax: Maybe they should still buff them
[2:43:14] itsgafner: I stick to one lane shrooming or 1 objective at a time
[2:43:23] 18cmsoft: has teemo r nerf happened already
[2:43:41] fearshad0w: cho tilted
[2:44:09] kynushi9: what do you think about maligma on teemo ?

[2:55:55] zaffer_za: and its the reverse
[2:55:58] zaffer_za: happening
[2:56:11] funhero2: that graves did absolutely no damage
[2:56:16] funhero2: bro missed every spell
[2:56:50] luminus_sol: very mature
[2:57:08] funhero2: that senna dmg jesus
[2:57:20] LtChezo: @zaffer_za they removed mythics coz they did the opposite of what they were supposed to do
[2:57:31] SzDredd: @ipav999 when I heard about Teemo nerfs I glanced over patch notes and saw Zed changes - I liked Riot sense of humor LUL
[2:57:54] zaffer_za: @LtChezo but now you can get murdered instant you cannot counter with just  amythic
[2:57:57] zaffer_za: mythic
[2:58:38] zaffer_za: how is teemo now after the nerfs
[2:58:57] SzDredd: wasn't he buffed?
[2:59:05] SzDredd: his dmg or w/e

[2:59:19] funhero2: when does smolder come out
[2:59:23] funhero2: i want to play Spyro in league
[2:59:26] zaffer_za: nxt week
[2:59:34] Belial_Shax: Spyro the dragon
[2:59:36] fearshad0w: @ipav999 do you prefer mythics or no mythics?
[3:00:05] zaffer_za: mord
[3:00:24] zaffer_za: mord is hell when he gets rift
[3:00:25] Belial_Shax: Out of topic but I recently finished the first spyro game again lol
[3:00:37] SzDredd: @ipav999 it was in 14.1
[3:00:39] SzDredd: V14.1 - January 12th Hotfix Living Shadow Living Shadow Cooldown reduced to 20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16 seconds from 20 / 19.25 / 18.5 / 17.75 / 17.

[3:01:29] zaffer_za: are you going to play ranked
[3:01:57] itsgafner: Mord in the silver goes hard with riftmaker lol
[3:02:06] itsgafner: or Gwen
[3:02:07] funhero2: tbh everything goes hard in silver
[3:02:18] zaffer_za: mythic makes the game more balanced
[3:02:22] funhero2: u could be building tri force rapid fire cannon teemo and you can drop 20
[3:03:05] fartnitesux619: imagine he was kinda good at start of season now hes just sht
[3:03:34] fartnitesux619: but yi is strong in low elo
[3:04:11] fartnitesux619: teemo is countered by free item called sweeper
[3:05:01] fartnitesux619: i like analogy of low tier players as shtty programs
[3:06:12] zaffer_za: @itsgafner agreed
[3:07:26] fartnitesux619: remember when teemo shroom had 100% ap scaling
[3:10:07] fartnitesux619: it also had 750 base damage
[3:11:10] LtChezo: what if they give teemo the TF treatment and give him ad scalings
[3:12:41] SzDredd: you could tank your mmr if you don't get banned before that LUL
[3:14:01] Pitju99: morde adc Susge

[3:43:25] Oribo: cassio aand ryze are not that much played top right?
[3:43:46] LtChezo: they are really only played top to counter teemo
[3:43:51] Pitju99: you might get counterpicked but then theyll probably play rly bad so its fine
[3:45:19] Pitju99: honeslty good gp is kinda hard too but thats rare
