[0:15:18] atlasriverbdo: Good Morning
[0:15:23] weeaaabuwu: Goodmornin
[0:15:27] rndpanda: morning <3
[0:15:36] MagizZziaN: looking good with the beard btw
[0:15:37] kaiganchan: Buenos días!!!
[0:15:55] MagizZziaN: NOOOOO why... beard brother!
[0:16:01] kaiganchan: fine ^^
[0:16:03] Hebezwerg: do you know where crio is for the big fishe?
[0:16:19] Hebezwerg: ahh
[0:16:51] dubbeIdave: he spawns every 40-60 min and stays for about the same orso ^
[0:16:55] Ilya_Mako: dekhia hystria is a disappointment
[0:17:18] MagizZziaN: gonna try it today
[0:17:49] MagizZziaN: yeah i heard debo drops are low, but compass drop is up big.
[0:17:53] IronWishfull: what ap do you need for those spots ?
[0:18:00] Hebezwerg: and its always the same with new spots isnt it?
[0:18:06] Hebezwerg: they will get buffs soon
[0:18:07] Ilya_Mako: bot sure about compass parts yet
[0:18:08] dalianaD: going hystria for compass but no dekhia used yet
[0:19:27] Hebezwerg: or trash like any other spot in game
[0:19:34] dalianaD: I went hystria in 270ap
[0:19:36] AlienTurtle1: Hystria was super easy. The big Elten has some hard hits but they're very telegraphed - think gyfin underground hammer guy. Everything else is hitting with pool noodles.
[0:19:51] Ilya_Mako: event is fun there
[0:20:19] Rivendread: Is 1.4b at normal oluns good?
[0:20:30] AlienTurtle1: big elten only spawns once per 15ish minutes, and you fight it 1v1 so very easy to dodge if you need to
[0:20:44] flaiire: only rocks falling does damage at akman
[0:21:10] Rivendread: Looking for lung, with silver
[0:22:11] AlienTurtle1: yeah that or # of waves. for me elten was like 16-18 minutes very consistently
[0:22:32] Rogu14: so never KEKW
[0:22:46] flaiire: yseterday I got a 5ring hour at dekhia thornwood,2.5bil baby
[0:23:13] yui_la: so what class u use to test? your main witch or alt warrior?
[0:23:14] AlienTurtle1: wave spawn speed caps out, like other tower spots. Dehkia ash, dehkia oluns, stars end pillars all have a max spawn speed that you cant go faster than.
[0:23:20] tur_ru: which place is that?
[0:24:12] Ilya_Mako: feeling the same on lahn atm
[0:24:35] AlienTurtle1: feelssuccstrikerman
[0:25:42] Cookd_: ya it feels like the ratio of pillar to non pillar spots is off recently
[0:25:59] AlienTurtle1: yeah, all the best spots right now are as much about aoe size as damage
[0:26:41] madebazi: city of dead is an actual pain
[0:26:44] AlienTurtle1: all 7 dehkia spots are pillar
[0:26:45] Cookd_: yes
[0:26:45] flaiire: yes
[0:26:46] Hebezwerg: yes
[0:26:49] madebazi: yes
[0:26:54] UncommonNL: o/ morning
[0:27:07] flaiire: stars end
[0:27:12] AlienTurtle1: 7 I think? crypt isnt one
[0:27:59] Hebezwerg: i wouldnt count olun as pillar
[0:27:59] AlienTurtle1: new ulukita spot is like darkseekers though right? get artifacts and fuck off, not a "real" grindspot?
[0:28:17] Cookd_: yes 󠀀
[0:28:23] Cookd_: just moving to diff pillars
[0:28:25] GeSpammy: nah 100% a pillar
[0:28:26] flaiire: nah u move 1step :D
[0:28:32] AlienTurtle1: i dont think gyfin is different to calpheon elvia though
[0:28:36] Hebezwerg: i wouldnt count olun as pillar
[0:28:38] dubbeIdave: big pillar in middle Keepo
[0:28:49] madebazi: if thats pillar then darkseekers is also pillar lol
[0:28:57] GeSpammy: wait tungrad down bad Aware
[0:29:00] Cookd_: it was near the top
[0:29:29] AlienTurtle1: thats just a direct overlap with dehkia lol
[0:29:39] AlienTurtle1: 7/10 top spots are dehkia and all dehkia are pillar
[0:29:43] ChrisB_72: hi
[0:30:12] motormilk: They clealy wanted dhekia to be pillar, otherwise just add them as elvia.
[0:30:24] flaiire: I love pillars,I hate runing with witch
[0:30:50] AlienTurtle1: who cares about space when theres only 2 pillars per server NotLikeThis
[0:30:56] motormilk: Two pillars! :D
[0:31:05] Natsumiru: now if only they added more group spots that are worth grinding
[0:31:27] flaiire: make a dekhia hall spot for frontal damagers Kreygasm
[0:31:46] Azsharii: cyclops is the spot for classes without big aoes
[0:31:48] yui_la: btw, do normal fishing here can get the event fish? look that guys doing it.
[0:31:49] AlienTurtle1: @Natsumiru Dehkia turos is the #1 spot and Dehkia oluns is #3
[0:32:28] Natsumiru: followed by maybe buffing castle ruins and bloody monastery to the point they arent useless anymore and actually makes it so ppl wanna grind their cups instead of just afk farming biraghi with a tuvala geared alt
[0:33:29] flaiire: what if he is a genious
[0:33:32] Veshpertine: taking a break
[0:33:43] ValeryLionus: With that blanket and glasses are you trying to go for the proper oldman look now that you're a father? Kappa
[0:33:50] Natsumiru: @AlienTurtle1 ye i prefer a spot where i dont have to bring friends that get oneshot cause they either dont have 720gs or dont have their elixir rotation bought
[0:34:51] AlienTurtle1: @Natsumiru so you want endgame silver at non-endgame group spots? That would be an interesting catchup mechanic
[0:35:03] jacobbryce16: good morning Bicep hope you get tet today man
[0:35:06] flaiire: yy I feel you
[0:35:16] motormilk: From running in circles to standing still. We are evolving!
[0:35:24] Natsumiru: no there are plenty of spots that still need 700gs but dont oneshot you
[0:35:34] Natsumiru: @AlienTurtle1
[0:35:44] madmodelvl: ARA ARA time ?
[0:35:46] madmodelvl: :P
[0:36:07] yungkite1: what is this boss?
[0:36:10] GeSpammy: I dont mind pillar but the problem is that I cant stop for even 2min and ruin the lamp if i wanna go to get water or washroom.
[0:36:20] madmodelvl: ARARA ....
[0:36:21] AlienTurtle1: nice auras bro
[0:36:22] madmodelvl: hahahaha
[0:36:23] snowli1: auras?
[0:37:06] Rogu14: auras for boss rush is the most obsolete mechanic ever KEKW
[0:37:08] snowli1: draught?
[0:38:31] Natsumiru: castle ruins used to do this for ppl. you could just bring friends that are a bit lower geared while u overgear to compensate and that way y ou could make a nice 600-800m silver while chilling along the way. its just been solo spots lately. i honestly think they should add something like dehkia to some spots but instead of it being insanely strong it just turns the spot into a duo/trio spot and you just get a bit more trashloot.
[0:39:35] flaiire: u found the spot
[0:39:48] yungkite1: what does the boss rush give as rewards?
[0:41:28] Natsumiru: ye thats what i initially thought aswell after i saw them test the waters with the mountain of eternal winter having 2 versions 250 ap and 280ap
[0:41:29] AlienTurtle1: Im still hoping for group/guild boss blitz
[0:41:34] Natsumiru: but that spot turned out unusued
[0:41:40] Natsumiru: unused*
[0:42:53] Rogu14: SRO has cool mechanic on mobs, depending on your party size the elite mobs would spawn that were a lot harder than normal ones and give a lot more exp and drops
[0:46:03] Rogu14: silkroad online, basically dead game now as far as i know LUL
[0:46:09] Rogu14: dunno if its even online still
[0:46:19] AlienTurtle1: yeah that was the best new grinding mechanic in the last few years
[0:46:52] SuddenHuevos: buff warr when Sadge
[0:47:22] EMASSIO: hello hello
[0:47:42] SuddenHuevos: hello biceps hope today wiull be a good day
[0:47:46] cportlegend: what up soni
[0:47:46] AlienTurtle1: loot similar to xp distribution would be okay. 2 people = 60% each, 3-5 people 50% each, but you get much higher clear speed.
[0:48:04] cportlegend: what you up to today
[0:48:27] narrowsz: oh damn what made you want to play witch?
[0:48:29] cportlegend: i just saw you did c7 i had to thank you personally
[0:48:42] Tymmteam: all furniture buffs last for 3h?
[0:48:56] spidey3083: is the new dp ring any good at all?
[0:49:03] Rogu14: @Tymmteam some are 1h
[0:49:15] Rivendread: Bicep, what would you say is the easiest earth boss to do c7 for witch?
[0:49:38] flaiire: @BiceptimusPrime I started doing dekhia thronwood now and it drops alot of caphras,I have a c10 kutum and I am working on buying my 2 pen bs, is it worth to put those caphrases on my kutum while grinding for bs's
[0:49:43] INnoV: !glabs
[0:49:43] StreamElements: This is the latest glabs patch: https://www.blackdesertfoundry.com/global-lab-updates-26th-january-2024/

[0:51:06] magnum_benzynus: wait wait, so vanquishing C7 moon/sun boss gives SHEET DP/AP?
[0:51:57] cportlegend: they give different things, each, sun AP, earth item drop rate, and moon dp
[0:52:05] cportlegend: entire server gets it
[0:52:18] cportlegend: so arsha is juiced thanks to Soni
[0:52:20] Natsumiru: what would also be nice is them add something like an arena that spawns gatekeepers and other spots minibosses and have different difficulties of them. in turn they reward things like guarenteed goldbars and maybe an outfit like the orzeca on a very small chance. add in accesory rng boxes and you got a nice mix of challenge and reward with a simple design. gatekeepers used to be so much fun back in 2017-2018.
[0:52:37] cportlegend: theres two rotos one on hill, one under
[0:52:43] Natsumiru: 1 next to road
[0:52:49] magnum_benzynus: @cportlegend yeah yeah, I know, just didn't know it's sheet stat

[0:53:57] Natsumiru: cross road

[0:54:16] arcadianveil: @magnum_benzynus its the server buff
[0:54:18] Aaizen_Drake: just click the node
[0:54:19] Natsumiru: this is it
[0:54:21] cportlegend: yee
[0:54:46] Aaizen_Drake: gotcha
[0:55:54] cportlegend: someone know where the ice fishing event is?
[0:56:01] Natsumiru: balenos
[0:56:05] madebazi: so supposedly, when you hover over "dehkia ash" in monster zone info it actually shows a map with the locations

[1:08:18] Feartjeh: I personally don’t like the costume, but they still fit the design of the game
[1:09:25] motormilk: Are we talking about teh academia one?
[1:09:54] Yamashiro420: thats the first outfit i actually bought in a while
[1:10:03] raisuez: awake witch viable for NW/Siege?

[1:13:52] cryptoazz22: newbi question, why most of players made this gray thing on top and bottom of screen?
[1:13:56] death0angel: 400% for max trash increase I think
[1:14:03] Zycrus: you can have me for free KEKW
[1:14:13] Zycrus: Zycrus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! i mean it
[1:14:25] Yamashiro420: free indeed hexeJamming hexeJamming
[1:14:32] Zahard71: another day at ash forest

[1:14:55] Royal_Scream: is dekiah ash forest specific grindable for some classes? im at 309/413 can grind everything with my awakening ninja but ash forest just shreds me D:
[1:14:59] flaiire: @Feartjeh %100 from yellow scrool and %150 agris
[1:15:07] herliger: @death0angel there is - it is yellow scroll + agris + agris coin
[1:15:07] Feartjeh: so if I want more raw trash, I want drop amount only?
[1:15:22] Feartjeh: and don’t need drop rate?
[1:15:37] Feartjeh: if they drop between 0-2 ?
[1:15:51] Feartjeh: yes I get why that is also drop rate then
[1:16:00] Feartjeh: Trash
[1:16:05] Zycrus: what place still drops 0

[1:22:15] flaiire: hope u can get it at 1m
[1:22:20] Zycrus: but unlike back then, 1m trash is rather fast, and great value/h
[1:22:28] shinas: what are the chances we get a tag event with the anniversary?
[1:22:36] yui_la: the good thing is debo drop is not like the old days.
[1:22:42] funKShun: good morning Bicep biceptHai
[1:22:50] ZiegeL18: 400k trash and got 1 tet debo and 1 duo? or was the tet before the 400k?
[1:23:13] Zycrus: i need weapon exchange coupons KEKW
[1:23:21] shinas: i hate tagging for 3 bil :/
[1:23:22] Zycrus: have  a unsellable pen bs on a class i am not playing
[1:23:38] mewmewmoi: they should just make tag cost into 10 or 20 forever
[1:23:47] Zycrus: succ ninja looks slow compared to new scholar
[1:24:06] Forcefield22: what are you goals for the Debo? @biceptimusprime are you planning to sell it?
[1:24:25] EMASSIO: is it neccassary to level shy max  if I want to use her only for life skill
[1:24:33] heiineken: what's a Dehkia ?
[1:24:45] Zycrus: i can only hope the -50 atk speed selfbuff is a translation error :D and not a bug. imagine that speed is with actual -50% atk speed
[1:24:47] EMASSIO: ohhh
[1:24:55] EMASSIO: thx <3
[1:25:33] Urek_: it's a money sink
[1:25:35] Zycrus: universal weapons, and you unlock them for every class by just paying a certain amount for each class. depending on your weapons
[1:25:45] Urek_: trua
[1:25:47] Urek_: true*
[1:26:14] Zycrus: like, you have 3x tet bs and pay 1b for each class you want to have them on. once. you got 3x pen bs, you pay 5b once for every class you want to have them on
[1:26:20] Urek_: Not really
[1:26:25] Zycrus: and armors etc just are universal in general
[1:27:03] realnicedude23: The best silver sink already exists, we don't need another one. Vendor crons :)
[1:27:15] Tymmteam: do u know why the dehkia fuel/dura is reducing at a slower rate than what they claimed?
[1:28:08] Zycrus: the system i explained they wouldn't even have to develop, it already exists with aos gear, they just have to extend it, and make it silver instead of the aos currency
[1:28:16] Tymmteam: rn u have 255 left, but u have grinded for 30 mins so u should have 250 left
[1:29:00] Zycrus: yeah
[1:30:03] Zycrus: details are up to them, but just having the gear you own once show on all characters with a lock behind it, that you have to unlock once...shouldn't be too hardd
[1:31:41] Tymmteam: i grind tw, and i always refuel 80. and after 1h i still have like 10-20 fuel left LUL
[1:32:28] jacobbryce16: is the golden bell in the pack that's for sale with a 30 day value pack a permanent one how does the bell work is it 48h cooldown?
[1:32:39] Zycrus: i would even go further. the most annoying question for beginners...What class do i play. and once i got tet bs, got to try my class, and realize, i enjoy another class more, they basically have to start again

[1:39:25] 1i3to: The trick is to go when you have like 50 bases. Then it's harder to fail so much back to back :D

[1:43:44] lacotaa: Im keen to visit your place irl to inspect your pc. You have to have some sort of vodo doll near u to give bad rng or some shit at this point
[1:43:52] nescher000: Can u give us a lifehack to play BDO all day
[1:44:24] Laz_bdo: Never struggling, typical streamer rng
[1:44:36] 1i3to: I tried grinding it on ARsha but there are some people apparently who would want to kill me even tho there are plenty empty spots :(
[1:44:48] Laz_bdo: Should've learnt from me
[1:44:49] weisstag: Hey dude :D hows the debo going? i just arrived
[1:44:57] Mavepi: you should try awak wiz, even more chill and similar results
[1:45:03] John_Dread: does investment in nodes effect all mobs or only in the node area now?
