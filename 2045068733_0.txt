[2:38:07] jkbluing: W needs a buff
[2:38:12] teeth447: but if they are fast + rang + milio w with lucian lb, so annoying
[2:38:20] koldne5: is sundered to omen better with that matchup?
[2:38:29] xolaaan: What if q cast scales with as?
[2:38:32] teeth447: they had a high movility comp
[2:38:34] atlanticsunscreen: but their so fast even E doesnt matter they just walk out
[2:38:36] lionsgamer_: do you think tf ap was a better option there?
[2:38:42] atlanticsunscreen: W*
[2:38:47] fenty45: watch the new ice spice music video
[2:39:01] gabrilchad: hi naayl i follow u on yt

[2:39:19] Nightbot: https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=naayil
[2:39:23] lionsgamer_: it would break the combos
[2:39:23] G_ANIR: maybe ultimate
[2:39:26] jamerlengo0: @koldne5 i think it depends on how ahead yone is
[2:39:29] G_ANIR: more movement speed
[2:39:42] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[2:39:49] Howlyy_: If I'm not mistaken it's faster in wild rift isn't it?
[2:39:51] lionsgamer_: About the last game, do you think tf ad was a good call? or ap was better
[2:39:58] atlanticsunscreen: but then again its 5v5 so if you're team can provide good cc you should be fine
[2:40:24] ArinesQ: speed is really annoying
[2:40:43] atlanticsunscreen: has riot ever buffed or nerfed chanel times on champions?
[2:40:50] BABYBLVEYES: boss what do i build on aatrox if i cant move on from her
[2:41:13] ArinesQ: ranged champ with 999 movement speed is broken even if the champ doesnt have that much damage
[2:41:23] xolaaan: Naayil what if they implement the boots that are in wild rift? Armor pen boots and omnivamp boots
[2:41:33] lionsgamer_: depends on the champ tho? thats what i think tho
[2:41:36] BS_CloutC9: only thing more broken than movementspeed is more movementspeed
[2:41:52] Caendred: @naayil they actually do know, they even said it when explaining why they sometimes just give or take away 5 move speed to some champs. They know
[2:41:54] lionsgamer_: like some champs are slow have dashes
[2:42:03] zoax697_: what nerf aatrox ?
[2:42:03] beedsuspect: lillia with ult >
[2:42:09] lionsgamer_: welp yeah you re right, you have a point there

[2:42:39] i_artoria_i: they should nerf ghost into the ground for ranged champions.
[2:42:42] chrono_ward: Wtf is that disgusting riven skin
[2:42:57] daaxusr: what are the nerf of aatrox?
[2:43:10] jester86: do u respect viego players?
[2:43:24] CozyPorcupine: -5 movement speed is just foreshadowing a bigger nerf lo
[2:43:24] beedsuspect: base movespeed actually matters when chasing
[2:43:26] ArinesQ: ghost
[2:43:34] Nightbot: Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/naaayil
[2:43:42] lionsgamer_: rammus players
[2:43:49] wtwsean: i run fleet, switfness boots, and ghost on gnar, imagine that
[2:43:57] Aargul: they nerfed kata 5 ms because she was walking way to fast from mid to bot , then they make asol glide over the map in 2 sec...
[2:43:59] i_artoria_i: idc about darius with ghost. but the adcs with ghost thats a big problem
[2:44:01] jamerlengo0: @wtwsean :)
[2:44:20] Caendred: Well these runes and spells give bonus % move speed so the base does matter cause it affects how much move speed these tools give
[2:44:32] ArinesQ: @DivemeDiveme if i remeber right he does
[2:44:35] G_ANIR: for level
[2:44:36] jakillerbe: There is also little counterplay to ms no?
[2:44:36] G_ANIR: lol
[2:44:44] BABYBLVEYES: i think base ms only mattered when it was like season 3 and pizza feet pantheon had 355 ms and no one had dashes like today
[2:44:47] ArinesQ: but he might kick ur ass if u try to annoy him
[2:44:49] jester86: @Caendred +1 or -1
[2:44:53] poon_poonn: She's gonna griddy oh no nayil look out
[2:44:53] zaid_2030: riven player love to run you down at lvl2
[2:45:21] G_ANIR: she's bad
[2:45:23] beedsuspect: is it worth giving up boneplating for the item cdr rune?
[2:45:24] G_ANIR: trust me
[2:45:34] G_ANIR: she doesnt know how to play riven
[2:45:35] lionsgamer_: does doran blade keep working with aatrox? since it become life steal instead of omnivamp

[3:13:06] redziriuss: i tryed a safer setup bec naayil is scary af
[3:13:06] shinsora_: Naayil top lane is like just playing some 1vs1 maybe sometimes 2vs1 but without impact at the game
[3:13:13] zaid_2030: jg supp and adc will carry the game , not top or mid
[3:13:16] Howlyy_: That's true if u're not playing some tank I guess
[3:13:33] Nightbot: Follow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/naaaaayil/
[3:13:33] chr0nnick: You play toplane for the experience, not for impact lol
[3:13:37] KiLkooo: real

[3:13:58] shinsora_: Naayil if u got an veigar on your team that is doing good you dont have to worry anymore
[3:14:01] Starbladez95: all the game needs is that top lane wall & jungler passport and the game is finally balanced
[3:14:30] zaid_2030: maybe depends on champ , imagine you fed gp or irelia
[3:14:44] atlanticsunscreen: then again if morgana went bot they don't win that 3v3
[3:14:50] billyz1412: i think best aatrox do not have a counter
[3:14:58] gabrielwasneverhere10: I agree too gap because that riven was as useless as a toothless man at a corn on the cob eating contest.
[3:14:59] classikiii: Naayil just tp to bot lane when theyre fighting
[3:15:33] Cyrus142_: Yeah TP bot whenever you have teleport

[3:16:34] dripnpizzazz: in low elo it feels like the opposite, no matter if you go like 10/0 bot you just get oneshot by enemy sett
[3:16:44] crazytxt23: i mean im adc and sometimes i have a bit that  feeling as well
[3:17:02] jamerlengo0: yorick matchup is fun
[3:17:03] BS_CloutC9: full ad
[3:17:04] KiLkooo: isnt yorick like the worst hes ever been?
[3:17:07] shinsora_: they dont dodge GIGACHAD

[3:17:44] jrBuhuu: "Draven is making an exist" LUL
[3:17:46] atlanticsunscreen: but the guy willingly picked yorick into aatrox?
[3:17:54] KiLkooo: @KiLkooo dont know, i just hope hes not going to be meta once again xdd

[5:00:50] maxastro0: Naayil why did 2 pro korean players build this are they just not sure what's good yet or trolling?
[5:00:50] dxrjoseph: did you use the active?
[5:00:52] kkugell: imo*
[5:00:55] Sekugo: with sundered sky and shojin they all would be dead tbh

[5:01:58] Drukaz: :OOOOOOO
[5:02:03] maxastro0: Are they just not sure what's rlly good yet
[5:02:04] sskylinkk: they build that way to push waves and have tempo
[5:02:04] Drukaz: bye bye to that Ezreal
[5:02:12] P3taByte01: i guess in lck you wont be in a 1v3 or 1v4 situation
[5:02:22] kkugell: some times i dont understand korean builds
[5:02:25] KiLkooo: true ig just push waves and wait for mistakes yeh
[5:02:28] Sekugo: prob its like u said they build it to kill the squishys in pro play
[5:02:29] maxastro0: But I've always seen pros play lethality aatrox maybe they just play aatrox differently?
[5:02:31] P3taByte01: and therefore in soloq sundered sky and spear is better

[5:02:54] maxastro0: Pro play needs different things I quess??
[5:02:58] KiLkooo: @nuocloc123 this is smurf account dia 4 elo
[5:03:01] zizizi321: Pro
[5:03:04] Jezu_Kisuke: What was the build path, I just got internet back
[5:03:08] Razest: in pro they almost never go glass canon top, this was probably a specific matchup build
[5:03:43] mrWhateverItwas: also in korea one pro build's something then all other copies it.
[5:03:44] maxastro0: @razest they never go tank aatrox even before s14
[5:03:47] storm_l_: what elo is this?
[5:03:47] mrWhateverItwas: blindly
[5:03:49] kkugell: no , maybe like 0.2 seconds faster
[5:03:54] aakashwani_: I mean you'll have to do Q3 anyway sooooo
[5:04:21] KiLkooo: so its worse at splitting, you dont heal, you are squishy
[5:04:22] maxastro0: They have always gone lethality aatrox, maybe pros haven't discovered spear of showing and sunderd sky
[5:04:23] Wowen44: daisyyyy
[5:04:28] Razest: @sesegamee they never build anything other than BC shojin deaths dance as dmg
[5:04:34] Jezu_Kisuke: Is he using it with Ingenous rune?
[5:04:37] KiLkooo: i guess the items are cheap?
[5:04:39] P3taByte01: @Naayil i guess in pro play you wont be in 1v3 or 1v4 scenario. I guess this build pushes waves faster and your role in a teamfight is to oneshot a high prio target

[5:04:56] nuocloc123: The Yasuo dodge your 3rd Q, otherwise you one shot
[5:05:06] Sekugo: @sesegamee the fuck u mean they always went duskblade in pro play
[5:05:12] shind37: wouldnt hubris work well with the ult resets?
[5:05:13] maxastro0: @p3tabyte01 but wouldn't staying alive in the fight be the same
[5:05:21] maxastro0: @sekugo yeah that build was good
[5:05:39] maxastro0: Jm saying they are going lethality this season just cuz they did last season
[5:05:56] 18PAIN: XDDDD
[5:06:02] P3taByte01: @sesegamee dont know just trying to figure it out ^^
[5:06:09] jacob_erlh: why profane hydra?
[5:06:10] RonPonche: Riot should have let ravenous hydra stay the same, it was better for aatrox
[5:06:15] vorqnlol: do you know jaxres
[5:06:16] Jezu_Kisuke: R Auto q auto jezukiJezuSob
[5:06:32] maxastro0: The only reason they haven't switched to tankier aatrox is cuz they went lethality for so long that they can't accept he isn't gonna work with lethality as well now?
[5:06:54] Sekugo: @sesegamee they are not dumb no way
[5:06:55] maxastro0: I watch pro play a lot they always seem to catch up in builds too late
[5:06:55] sicritcat: I guess they go this build JUST because they have good teamplay and the sundered sky shojin build gets kited, one good play with this build is more valuable than a sustained fight bcs sustained fights don't happen that often

[5:07:46] shind37: sundered sky + Hubris?
[5:07:55] canergumus: maybe an eclipse too?
[5:08:00] KiLkooo: go sunderer first instead of hydra and shojin second instead of edge of night and its a good build

[5:12:18] kwstasmp5: for profane hydra i use it for final item or early if its risky champs cuz i go 3rd and 4th tank items like omen and rookern
[5:12:18] shind37: since sundered sky is a garunteed crit it works well with a shit ton of AD from the the lethality items
[5:12:21] niba0706: @storm_l_ oh ty for telling would collector be alright
[5:12:22] byzjdr: sundered is a must imo, then you can go lethality
