[0:43:58] J1o6ctep: Exactly, they're even scarier because they're not really diseases. Like, it's not a virus or bacteria, which are made to recreate themselves. It's just a bad protein, which can't help but turn your brain into a sponge despair

[0:45:56] ZeroNothing: thats a tilter and saver for some teams
[0:46:19] dutch_gecko: @J1o6ctep viruses and prions aren't that different to eachother. Neither is alive, they're a collection of molecules that happen to replicate themselves inside a living ccreature

[0:47:18] ZeroNothing: we contesting
[0:47:30] ZeroNothing: sabz took our poi
[0:47:33] J1o6ctep: @J1o6ctep But viruses are actively trying to get better at replication. Like, they have intent behind them. Prions aren't, they don't try to get better at replicating, they just... are
[0:47:47] ZeroNothing: alphadraft and dunno
[0:47:54] ZeroNothing: p4dawan?
[0:48:26] Fhane: Prions is just bad RNG
[0:48:28] xXx_faultysage_420_69_xXx: Scientists: "Viruses aren't alive" Viruses: *undergo evolution by natural selection anyway just to fuck with the scientists*
[0:48:34] dutch_gecko: @J1o6ctep viruses aren't trying anything (nor is any living thing for that matter). Evolution happens, the entities that take part in it don't "have a goal"

[0:51:16] xXx_faultysage_420_69_xXx: "Where does it say that a dog can't play Apex?"
[0:51:44] J1o6ctep: @J1o6ctep You're right, but what I meant is that there's a mechanism that improves replication abilities: mutations. Viruses, despite not being alive, have it. Prions don't. Like, here's another take on situation: bacterias and parasites exploit living bodies to live, viruses exploit living bodies just to replicate, and prions ARE the self-replicating exploits in living bodies.
[0:52:52] Fhane: DO IT
[0:52:54] Fhane: I LOVE THAT SKIN
[0:52:56] ZeroNothing: i have that too!
[0:53:03] ZeroNothing: and i dont own good skins
[0:53:10] dutch_gecko: @J1o6ctep I see what you mean, but I don't think we can rule out that prions undergo natural selection too. The immune system is capable of cleaning up misfolded proteins, so the prion diseases that exist now are somehow capable of avoiding that process
[0:53:11] Fhane: I run the Kawaii Kitty Wattson skin
[0:53:31] tortoise_apex: nah why is your shop actually good
[0:53:36] J1o6ctep: @J1o6ctep Also true. Doesn't make them less scarier tho

[0:55:36] J1o6ctep: Wait, I'm dumb, I thought it originally cost 1000
[0:55:41] J1o6ctep: Nevermind
[0:56:00] ZeroNothing: they must paid for those anime skins ip right
[0:56:05] ZeroNothing: evangelion
[0:56:09] tortoise_apex: @ColdButch_Winter they also had a starwars collab
[0:56:20] tortoise_apex: but that was the same studio i think
[0:56:23] xXx_faultysage_420_69_xXx: @ZeroNothing Those were Legally Distinct from Shonen Jump Hero skins
[0:56:36] ZeroNothing: EA owns star wars and makes star wars games
[0:56:36] J1o6ctep: Nah, that's just IMC skin
[0:56:43] ColdButch_Winter: @ZeroNothing absolutely not, they had the change the octane skin cause it was too much like the actual character
[0:56:46] J1o6ctep: She looks like she's about to get crushed by my Scorch
[0:56:52] tortoise_apex: its just a pathy skin that you got for free
