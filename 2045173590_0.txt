[1:14:53] Nightbot: Look, chat. Kaif likes to discover and find out about a game on his own and get to experience the novelty of discovering new things in games that he hasn't played before. To that objective, we ASK that you do NOT give information or tell Kaif what to do or how to do something in the games, unless he asks chat directly for help. If you believe there is something that Kaif would not find out unless told about it, you can write it in chat, just don't be a cunt about it and don't spam.
[1:14:56] babyhoot: @ItsMwindo well yes but its also one of the games with the most toxic community LUL

[1:28:30] yanembaa: that wallpaper is class kaifW
[1:28:38] zepidreus: Where did the term bellend even originate as an insult?
[1:29:35] bupronephrine: @tdesius Egg.
[1:29:36] Deaboi: Valid question.. got to look this up, origin of bellend
[1:29:44] Bladelord192: i heard AP volibear is a fun jungle Kappa
[1:30:16] Lubbeliten: @SR_Kaif Kata had an extra cannon minion to farm ;)

[1:31:46] SturmGeist08: I am gonna fucking lose it. After 30 minutes I finally got that lurk gif transparent
[1:31:52] Selem: Years ago, I believe
[1:31:59] hotswitchexe: AP Shyv has been her main build for a long time
[1:32:01] TDesius: AP Shyv became the norm once Bruiser Shyv died
[1:32:01] ItsMwindo: pepeD
[1:32:20] TDesius: Cause no one plays her "Mostly" LUL
[1:32:24] babyhoot: cuz no one plays her xD
[1:32:26] hotswitchexe: because Shyv in general isn't a common pick
[1:32:58] hotswitchexe: there's a reason why she's going to have a rework soon-ish
[1:33:11] hotswitchexe: Hope they keep the AP build
[1:33:47] Nightbot: Rules: First do not harass other members of chat.  There is a limit on caps so dont use caps lock. Dont spam emotes. Don't spam commands, they are here for fun not to flood the chat.  NO 'back seat gaming' Kaif will play how he wants to play, unless he ask for help.  A mod voice is final, if they ask you to stop; you will stop.  When playing social deceit games if you have an assumption make it clear. Finally dont be a fucking cunt. kaifGrr kaifGrr
[1:33:55] Lubbeliten: Have you tried ap udyr? with liand/rift?
[1:34:26] TDesius: @SR_Kaif Did you see my DM btw?
[1:34:50] TDesius: Just checking :D
[1:35:06] DuskEdgeX: Why does new udyr look even beefier?
[1:35:15] TDesius: They gave him a dad bod
[1:35:16] hotswitchexe: according to a Rioter interview, they're planning on giving her an Udyr style rework, so there's a decent chance they'll keep her AP build
[1:35:23] TDesius: To match his actual lore and area he lives in
[1:35:28] Lubbeliten: godly gank ;)
[1:36:02] TDesius: They didn't stand a GHOST of a chance LUL

[2:03:46] TDesius: I mean just gotta hit the 0/10 power spike right?
[2:04:06] hotswitchexe: @TDesius nah, that's Yasuo Kappa

[2:12:04] hotswitchexe: truly, the archer class is made of archers
[2:12:17] ItsMwindo: LUL

[2:18:23] wollmyre24: the dash gives two shells when you dash towards an enemy champ
[2:19:26] Colorstrike: looking good
[2:19:33] hotswitchexe: 4/0/4, enemy not found
[2:19:44] theflameelement: is this Kaif the Rat Jungler?
[2:21:04] hotswitchexe: The explosion does less damage
[2:21:25] hotswitchexe: it detonates on first target hit or after a certain range
[2:21:38] Lyraii: kaifWOW
[2:21:47] tturnipsi: So this was supposed to be the feed round for Kaif
[2:21:58] hotswitchexe: @Lyraii love that emote kaifWOW
[2:22:13] TDesius: If I remember Kaif, the Cone does 80% of the shells damage.
[2:22:14] MAD_B0X: Damn, Kaif is one a ROLL.
[2:22:14] Lyraii: its so cute
[2:22:16] TDesius: Just longer reach
[2:22:18] babyhoot: poor guy got bullied
[2:22:21] hotswitchexe: does Kaif realise how fed he is kaifW

[2:22:52] babyhoot: who needs boots when you can buy 2 items LUL
[2:23:42] darkkrusty: careful, dont want the 0/7 yas powerspike
[2:24:15] TDesius: But yeah, the Ult does more damage with the pellet than the spread, but I think the spread goes through windwall as long as the pellet isn't "Blocked" by it. LUL
[2:24:29] ItsMwindo: Graves look real solid. Nice damage, utility and mobility
[2:24:46] darkkrusty: @TDesius im fairly sure Windwall blocks even the pellets, unless it got changed
[2:24:57] SturmGeist08: Returned with sushi, what did I miss?
[2:25:02] darkkrusty: but its been awhile since I played league, so my knowledge could be out of date
[2:25:06] TDesius: I said the spread after the pellet  though
[2:25:11] TDesius: It's an explosion after the pellet
[2:25:27] ItsMwindo: LUL
[2:25:28] darkkrusty: @TDesius Oh I know what you mean but I am fairly sure I have seen the Wall block that after the pellet explodes
[2:25:28] TDesius: It might block it, but I rarely ever fight graves
[2:25:42] hotswitchexe: Fun fact: at some point in Shaco's development, one of his ults would turn him into a projectile, but they scrapped that after realising that him hitting windwall would delete Shaco from the game LUL
[2:25:54] babyhoot: man they just throwing lifes away xD
[2:26:10] ItsMwindo: Holy shit, really?
[2:26:13] hotswitchexe: Oof
[2:26:28] darkkrusty: YT chat be wildin
[2:26:34] Colorstrike: KEKW
[2:26:37] TDesius: @hotswitchexe But yasuo wasn't developed for 4 years until after Shaco
[2:26:45] Lyraii: bloody youtube chat LUL
[2:26:50] ItsMwindo: It's still a bit of an oof, even now LUL
[2:26:53] sush1ward: stop there buddy XD

[2:26:54] SturmGeist08: Yt being cursed
[2:27:12] ItsMwindo: Graves is fucking FILTHY LUL
[2:27:15] Colorstrike: holy
[2:27:19] Fumbling101: Broke his fucking ancles
[2:27:19] MisonS2: i think kaif found his new main
[2:27:19] TDesius: Graves just being a bully
[2:27:20] darkkrusty: as a former Darius main....that was painful to watch
[2:27:21] TDesius: LUL
[2:27:24] babyhoot: god dam graves have gotten strong
[2:27:26] SirStebe: 11/1/6 HOT DAMN
[2:27:52] darkkrusty: Just remember chat! this Be IRON! Bronze 4? at best, Kaif is at least a Bronze 3, so hes Bullying them hard
[2:29:10] babyhoot: look at that large boy
[2:29:27] darkkrusty: see what I mean? Bronze 3 Kaif vs Bronze 4 and Irons, its a bullyfest!
[2:29:28] babyhoot: @darkkrusty i do belive kaif demoted to iron 1
[2:30:09] TDesius: Aye Kaif is indeed an Iron boy
[2:30:12] hotswitchexe: @hotswitchexe when was Shaco rework released? I might've mixed the two
[2:30:18] TDesius: But is a secret Emerald LUL
[2:30:38] darkkrusty: ah, so Iron 1 Kaif vs Iron 3/4's right, so its still a slaughter fest
[2:30:43] sush1ward: @SR_Kaif can you enable tool tips on your twitch stream ?
[2:30:54] babyhoot: @TDesius i mean i have been told by a friend the ranks do be playing the same LUL
[2:31:06] magemafia: why is there someone farming top instead of joining teamfights :/
[2:31:21] darkkrusty: I think its like where if stream mouses over the ability on screen they can see what it does, bit like DBD has something like that
[2:31:24] Silfel: @magemafia splitpushing is a strategy
[2:31:25] Traven64: Traven64 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! tried the item eclipse yet? it do be ridonkolous
[2:31:49] babyhoot: @magemafia split pushing and its just in general a cho
[2:32:10] darkkrusty: @babyhoot Cho and Nasus Split kings, both raid bosses that cant be ignored.
[2:32:12] SageMikeGamer: @magemafia because if you dont win team fight why fight?
[2:32:26] sush1ward: if I click on your inventory i cant read item descriptions and read spells what they so and stuff
[2:32:30] babyhoot: @babyhoot indeed specially after sion lost his raidboss title
[2:33:03] darkkrusty: @babyhoot as a former Sion main back in s6/s7, yeah Madge
[2:33:05] ItsMwindo: Oh yeah, I've seen that addon it's really nice
[2:33:18] babyhoot: @darkkrusty i miss raidboss sion
[2:33:22] darkkrusty: and yeah kaif you could look into it, I have seen DBD has it cause Bahroo *when I watched him* had it enabled
[2:33:31] SturmGeist08: Got some sushi, what's your go to sushi Kaif?
[2:34:37] darkkrusty: @babyhoot rush shout max in lane with comet on sion, the rage it generated? KEKW, start dorans ring for just a little bit of AP and you would rule the lane
[2:34:50] ItsMwindo: deleted, jesus christ
[2:35:07] darkkrusty: reports ebbz, Int, feed, toxic!
[2:35:13] TDesius: Oh Kaif, there's apparently a Live Tracker Extension and a Mobalytics Twitch Extension, so probably more like Porofessor / OP GG if that's the case.
[2:35:27] babyhoot: @darkkrusty ye, i had a friend once who played sion jg we ended the game without him going back to buy one item it was the funniest shit ever
[2:35:38] hotswitchexe: I'd like to remind everyone that this is Kaif's first Graves game ever kaifW
[2:36:05] darkkrusty: @babyhoot Sion tactic, you steal the top buff if jungle starts bottom *or steal bottom*, die and take it with passive, you have it on the respawn and then you tp lane with a buff!
[2:36:19] fabulousemperor: https://mobalytics.gg/twitch-extension/ @SR_Kaif
[2:36:22] SageMikeGamer: there is baron

[2:36:54] TDesius: LUL
[2:36:57] darkkrusty: @babyhoot yeah it eventually became a well used tactic, your team effectivly gets 3/4 of the inital buff spawns
[2:37:04] babyhoot: @darkkrusty thats a really need piece of tech
[2:37:13] hotswitchexe: La Bomba

[3:03:45] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[3:04:49] TurtleThePunnyRabbit: It's all going so wrong, so quickly
[3:07:46] hotswitchexe: Is Graves gonna carry Kaif out of Iron kaifW

[3:50:09] Ninosai: you're just built better, Beren
[3:50:21] TDesius: you mean Built Worse
[3:50:27] TDesius: don't Sugar coat it for him

[3:50:42] jaxus84: Camera back, noice
[3:50:43] thehighborn: gotta get them skills up Beren :D
[3:50:45] TheMasterBadger: I just cannot be arsed to play ranked league, being a support main has been hell for years. I stick to ARAM
[3:50:55] Mr_Berenike: Iya deeesius
[3:51:29] TheMasterBadger: And specifically being a Sona main makes it worse
[3:51:35] Mr_Berenike: @thehighborn I aaam but im in that rank with all the toxic and obnoxious players that gg ff within the first 10 seconds of the game start and then start whinging all game for the next 30 minutes xD
[3:51:46] Mr_Berenike: its hard to improve your skill when riot literally hates you
[3:52:17] TheMasterBadger: Riot LITERALLY made a new champion instead of reworking my main
[3:52:28] TheMasterBadger: In the most offensive way possible
[3:52:40] Mr_Berenike: tbh I was having a bad day and just kept bashing my head against a wall hoping for a normal game
[3:53:25] SturmGeist08: @Ninosai Honestly I wouldn't mind at all. Anything I make for Kaif he is free to use for whatever he wants
[3:53:32] TDesius: Kaif what's with the people who keep placing wards on you LUL
[3:53:35] TDesius: Ryze just did that
[3:53:46] SageMikeGamer: jungle tax its called Kappa
[3:53:52] jaxus84: They replaced herald with maggots?
[3:54:14] Mr_Berenike: Welcome to the rice field muffa fuckaaa
[3:54:45] SageMikeGamer: @jaxus84 no just the first one
[3:55:04] TheMasterBadger: Slaanesh help me, I kind of wanna play some ranked
[3:55:26] TDesius: The Ryze has confused me
[3:55:29] TDesius: I am confuddled
[3:55:30] jaxus84: God emperor save you, Badger
[3:55:46] TheMasterBadger: Does Ebbz know Klingon?
[3:56:03] SageMikeGamer: @TheMasterBadger slaanesh only need your lust
[3:56:49] Mr_Berenike: Ooohk oohk
[3:56:58] Mr_Berenike: kaifSniperMonke
[3:57:00] TheMasterBadger: @SageMikeGamer A common misconception based on the capitalist needs of the company controlling the lore. Slaanesh is the god of all emotions, lew, evil, and good.
[3:57:13] TheMasterBadger: *lewd
[3:57:23] Mr_Berenike: that jihn wiffed haaard
[3:57:32] Mr_Berenike: Absolute whiff merchant
[3:57:47] SageMikeGamer: @TheMasterBadger still only want your lust
[3:58:02] Ninosai: Slaanesh is the Chaos god of excess. Be it lust, pride, arrogance. It's just associated hard with lust because the Eldars 'created' Slaanesh from a massive orgy kaifWoops kaifW
[3:58:20] Mr_Berenike: murder orgy
[3:58:36] TDesius: Aye, he was literally lust filled murderfucked into existence LUL
[3:58:37] jaxus84: Slaanesh is "Would" incarnate
[3:58:46] Ninosai: LUL
[3:58:54] TDesius: Well he/she/they since Slaanesh is all
[3:58:56] TDesius: LUL
[3:59:04] Ninosai: Yes, yes
[3:59:36] Mr_Berenike: imagine just murderfucking a god into existence, your empire kinda deserves to die for that
[3:59:43] TheMasterBadger: The important thing is they ALSO embody the excess of being thrown out of an all you can eat buffet
[3:59:43] Mr_Berenike: @TDesius it
[4:00:05] TDesius: @Mr_Berenike Thing
[4:00:05] SageMikeGamer: about to play total war warhammer 3 any recomidations for a race?
[4:00:21] Mr_Berenike: @Mr_Berenike Abomination!
[4:00:29] Mr_Berenike: purge it with fire *nods*
[4:00:32] Ninosai: @SageMikeGamer skavens
[4:00:41] TheMasterBadger: Anyone wanna guess who Stan's Chaos god of choice is?
[4:00:52] curong: Slannesh
[4:01:05] TheMasterBadger: We don't want him. Choose another
[4:02:02] curong: Tzeentch?
[4:02:18] IIlSoralIl: LUL
[4:02:29] curong: kaifW kaifW kaifW
[4:02:38] SageMikeGamer: ryze sacrificed her for the greater good
[4:03:00] IIlSoralIl: Ryze use her to save himself
[4:03:23] jaxus84: kaifPogfrog
[4:03:43] Nightbot: No BSG or meta gaming. Don't try telling Kaif what he should do, how he should play. Unless he specifically asks help from chat.
[4:04:37] jaxus84: Sick
[4:05:13] jaxus84: Bean juice is tasty
[4:05:28] curong: love me my dirty bean water
[4:05:43] Curt_The_Hurt_xx: I'm back chat from drinking mead and I might be a little drunk
[4:06:06] SageMikeGamer: after 15 min noting is your lane and farm is for everyone
[4:06:38] IIlSoralIl: in fact the midlane minions reach faster as well
[4:06:58] jaxus84: Because of OPi wan?
[4:07:05] SageMikeGamer: wait why is stan worrying about farm as a support?
[4:07:32] DerpyDoot: Stan is eepy
[4:07:46] datfishyboii: are ya winnin’ son?
[4:07:50] Klony99: Who are we ironing, Daddy Kaif?
[4:08:20] SageMikeGamer: oh wait nvm i see now stan is adc
[4:08:35] thehighborn: so hows that Ashe support doing? :D
[4:09:29] Destin_the_Insane: I'm trying...and failing...to understand Stan's mind here.
[4:09:33] TDesius: The idea of Mid to Bot rotation is something that happens in higher ELO/MMR and Ranks at least as a more natural thing rather than forced. So I guess that change in theory throws him off?
[4:09:35] SageMikeGamer: @thehighborn falling off in mid game
[4:10:06] thehighborn: hmmm .... but thats where i start to shine when i play her @SageMikeGamer  :D
[4:10:08] curong: Teemo got "smoked"
[4:10:18] DerpyDoot: @TDesius you're probably right honestly
[4:10:22] jaxus84: Teemo got dutch oven'd
[4:10:42] SageMikeGamer: @thehighborn lucky you then
[4:11:23] TDesius: It also depends on the characters. Like Zed or Yasuo don't generally leave the mid as they want to be in all the fights, but some Mages find its better to move to the bot lane and continue there etc.
[4:11:24] theflameelement: at how many items can you solo Baron with graves kaif?
[4:12:33] TDesius: Kaif what if Teemo was always there in the bush LUL
[4:14:35] AwesomeInABox: you were blinded as graves he shoots randomly
[4:14:40] AwesomeInABox: from the teemo
[4:15:02] Mr_Berenike: rolled a crit 1
[4:15:07] knifezap: @sr_kaif would you ever play the pal world mod where it turns everthing into pokemon
[4:15:14] AwesomeInABox: you can get lucky rarely and actually still hit the target you attack when blinded as graves
[4:15:16] thehighborn: Ashe missing every R :D
[4:15:24] SturmGeist08: I keep hearing the windows sound, but I am pretty sure it's just from Kaif's pc
[4:15:31] DerpyDoot: @knifezap didn't that one get nuked from orbit by nintendon't?
[4:15:42] MisonS2: yes it did @DerpyDoot
[4:16:06] SageMikeGamer: @thehighborn she did hit 1 where ebbs died at the tower killing jhin
[4:16:19] TDesius: LUL
[4:16:28] TDesius: I can hop in for one if you need it LUL
[4:16:31] Mr_Berenike: boi boooi
[4:16:39] thehighborn: @SageMikeGamer sometimes these games just happen where you hit 1 in 7 Rs
[4:16:40] knifezap: oh makes sense
[4:17:00] SageMikeGamer: @SageMikeGamer indeed
[4:17:22] SageMikeGamer: @SageMikeGamer or when your morgana cant hit there Q's
[4:18:16] TDesius: Aye gotta do it all prior

[4:20:29] thehighborn: @SageMikeGamer oh yeahs thats been me more times than i like to admit :D
[4:20:33] Mr_Berenike: I use porofessor
[4:20:47] SageMikeGamer: @SageMikeGamer dont worry same here HAHAHAHA
[4:20:57] Mr_Berenike: though the thing that tracks enemies summoner spells doesn't quite work right for me :/
[4:21:17] thehighborn: @SageMikeGamer worst thing is i used to main Morgana for awhile in my first year of ranked and i was actually quite decent and now its not pretty
[4:22:09] thehighborn: ah i can see where the Ashe i differ i go Ap haste reduction build and this Ashe went for AD lethality :D
[4:22:35] SageMikeGamer: @SageMikeGamer i started morganna main in mid lane back when she came out with the intension she was a midlaner
[4:22:44] Destin_the_Insane: kaifHeart
[4:22:53] Mr_Berenike: ad lethailty :o
[4:23:18] MightyLaVolpe: I started the game cause of Ahri
[4:23:20] thehighborn: @SageMikeGamer my first 3 supports where Veigar Lux and Morgana and Lux ended up beeing my best one
[4:23:22] TDesius: I want AD Malz jungle to return LUL
[4:23:29] SageMikeGamer: @SageMikeGamer then zyra came out and now i dont know what to play support anymore or even if i want to play support anymore
[4:24:00] thehighborn: @SageMikeGamer Zyra is rarely a good support from what i see
[4:24:27] TheMickus: gotta love low elo
[4:24:31] Drokat: haven't played this game for years, community still toxic? KEKW
[4:24:52] MisonS2: does the sun still shine? @Drokat
[4:24:53] SageMikeGamer: @SageMikeGamer same with anyother dmg support if you hit your cc and everything like that then its good
[4:24:57] TDesius: Community is always toxic LUL
[4:25:01] TDesius: It's why you play with friends
[4:25:01] TheMickus: @Drokat kinda, depends on the elo, server and time of the day
[4:25:14] Drokat: @TheMickus ok
[4:25:59] SageMikeGamer: @SageMikeGamer also depents on how your adc plays and how your adc reacts
[4:26:01] TheMickus: @Drokat but riot made it easier to ignore toxicity completely and have gotten better at punishing toxicity
[4:26:34] Mr_Berenike: @TDesius but... what if you dun have does? mrbereCry
[4:26:35] TDesius: Was about to say, Zoe will be this matches Menace LUL

[4:27:32] Lyraii: yeah but stan death funny
[4:27:43] TDesius: I mean KS or not, You'd take the kill, he'd live. Could be there for another wave or 2 and then dipped. You are right on this LUL
[4:27:51] TDesius: But the kills are sometimes shiny
[4:27:56] Naofumiz: It also would have given 1 more person kill participation. And as you said let him farm, would have been way more gold so i agree
[4:28:23] Naofumiz: gj gj
[4:29:10] Lyraii: there's a voice I don't recognise, who is your 5th?
[4:29:32] Lyraii: Ahhh

[6:36:05] FrozenHeaven666: 1 of things I dont like graves is 0 pen so ppl or minions can block your attacks
[6:36:07] Witch_Shaelyn: When I have to top I generally just play Gnar cuz I love that lil Gremlin
[6:36:11] Shadow_Wulf: before shaco rework was made, I use to shaco top
[6:36:16] SilverBowzPT: If you call wasting an ult while they'r top laner continuein to retreat isane
[6:36:44] Witch_Shaelyn: I mostly just main Vel though
[6:36:51] SilverBowzPT: oh my bad

[6:40:02] SilverBowzPT: dudes Killing it with Graves so tought he  had mained

[6:40:41] SilverBowzPT: Shen tried XD
[6:42:42] Jackkabuki: has shen been reworked at all?

[6:43:51] Colorstrike: pro gamer move
[6:44:07] TotalVoidd: I join, 5 seconds pass, kaif dives a turret, dies. Peak iron gameplay

[6:44:27] tyr_vidar: brouldEZ
[6:46:26] TotalVoidd: Samira should not exist
[6:47:35] Witch_Shaelyn: That Rammus must be fuming

[6:47:47] tyr_vidar: Rammus has the bluest of balls
[6:48:27] Witch_Shaelyn: kaifW
[6:50:26] Witch_Shaelyn: Kaifs auto cleaved onto the nexus and ended the game kaifW
[6:52:11] SazarJr: wait stormsurge got nerfed?

[6:56:36] DrPoopie: The main pool of scripters are in plat/emerald, scripts only carry you so far.
[6:59:59] pup_polydon: i had scripters in aram
[7:00:16] Witch_Shaelyn: 1 hp and a dream
[7:01:05] Isquen: I had a ranked game earlier today where an MF had 95 lethality and ulted me
[7:01:12] Witch_Shaelyn: The bois! Sadge
[7:01:19] Isquen: I died in two bullets and I had frozen heart and natural armor :')
[7:01:35] monkastab: @Isquen :)
[7:01:46] monkastab: milf fortune does that
[7:06:56] wollmyre24: good old league chat

[7:17:41] Witch_Shaelyn: That was NOT in their favor xD
[7:18:38] Jackkabuki: I remember the days of TF and pantheon Backdoor pushing with their global ults
[7:19:28] Witch_Shaelyn: y'all are weird if you take photos of someone eating tf
[7:24:50] Witch_Shaelyn: Stan with a steel chair!
[7:27:43] IluRin: farm champions not minions duh!
[7:27:56] Witch_Shaelyn: Who needs to farm minions when you farm champions kaifW
[7:28:14] SazarJr: it's always 5 more min :3
[7:32:01] obellicious: GG

[7:37:09] Fenzha: Have we found out whats poisoning Stan's sandwiches?
[7:38:09] wollmyre24: did you know Yorick is gay? (he really digs Graves)
[7:38:37] Cmgaming7: so wouldnt that just be qa sausage roll
[7:40:35] vincentfrost1: oh no... did stan dragged kaif back into League of Legends again>
[7:41:02] vincentfrost1: well.. maybe not stan
[7:41:36] faroeseprik: @vincentfrost1 well they have been playing it for a bit since the new season
[7:43:22] vincentfrost1: an new season, an new character added, an new fav player character that is op; character that has been nerfed and screaming kids.. yep.. smells like LoL
[7:46:06] Fenzha: Gary trying to communicate with my neighbours

[8:03:36] nagarider: lets see if it hits a tower
[8:04:52] nagarider: eyyyyy
[8:05:12] nikobesneaky: that's 3 seconds of lockdown for ya
[8:05:16] Destin_the_Insane: The Poppy W stopped you from moving.
[8:06:34] nagarider: I like how the mini map is MEGA huge xD
[8:09:12] nagarider: So is this just league for funnises or is it tied to a challenge or punishment game?
[8:10:08] TheOneZeek: League and fun just aren't words that ever seem to go together lol
[8:11:03] nagarider: gg
[8:11:09] Lyraii: hm
[8:11:29] Lyraii: seems the important bit of the base is gone
[8:13:20] Witch_Shaelyn: I took a small nap took a shower and come back and you're still streaming xD wasn't expecting that
[8:13:28] sparkdinho: long stream today, love it
[8:15:45] Witch_Shaelyn: Lillia's so fast man
[8:17:46] GrifCato: how goes games
[8:18:01] totaldramax: is tristana good
[8:19:13] Fumbling101: She has some good match-ups in midlane
[8:19:57] totaldramax: i was looking up videos about it all since im 1 day new
[8:20:12] Fumbling101: if you're that new any champion can work for you
[8:20:17] Fumbling101: Just find one you vibe with
[8:20:26] totaldramax: gotchu
[8:20:31] SazarJr: @totaldramax Shes a Yordle and all Yordles are great :3
[8:20:49] Fumbling101: Except for Singed and Yuumi, they're very very different from everybody else, and interact with the game in a wonky way that you shouldn't invest time into as a new player imo
[8:28:45] popCatter: @Fumbling101 i'd probably put gp in that group too
[8:34:50] Fumbling101: @popCatter Kindda - he's definitely in the highly advanced group, but he fundamentally plays the game same as everybody else
[8:35:07] Fumbling101: Technically Singed does as well, but it's not what he's designed to do
[8:36:38] Fumbling101: Garen and Annie are the two best champs in terms of how simple they are for new players to pick up
[8:38:35] aXionages: amumu as well @Fumbling101
[8:38:47] Fumbling101: Yeah Amumu is also an excellent simple champ
[8:39:25] Fumbling101: I'd advice new players to stay far away from ad carry champions - making them work outside of high elo is very hard relatively to playing almost anything else in botlane
[8:41:42] meister_one: @Fumbling101 the reason its so hard is cause they have to be so squishy as they are the most overpowered characters in the game if played well, so if the new player doesnt mind getting their butt blasted for couple hundred games, they'll gain the single most disgusting role as a reward
[8:42:35] Fumbling101: Wouldn't call them overpowered, but they definitely can be strong in the right hands. Just no reason to approach the game like that xD
[8:45:25] Destin_the_Insane: @Fumbling101 To add to this, I would advise new players play Karthus and learn how to last hit with his autos instead of his Q. If you can learn that, then you can last hit with pretty much any ranged champ.
[8:46:12] Ninosai: totsNoted noted, never play League
[8:46:30] Fumbling101: @Ninosai This is really the takeaway
[8:46:42] Fumbling101: If any of my friends asked me if they should get into League I'd say naw xD
[8:47:25] Simonvmadsen: Insane sidestep on cait E
[8:47:27] Ninosai: On that note I'm off to bed. peepoLeave Be nice chat
[8:47:34] Fumbling101: @Ninosai Sleep well Nino!
[8:47:54] Axe_M0: Night Nino PETTHEMODS
[8:48:11] fabulousemperor: night nino Bedge
[8:49:20] Axe_M0: LUL
[8:49:36] Raini02: new monster hunter looks lit
[8:50:05] Fumbling101: @Raini02 Imagine VR getting chased by a massive Cho'Gath like
[8:50:16] Raini02: monkaChrist
[8:50:37] iDaisukee: i didn't realise you went in" thats what she said
[8:51:42] Zumzar97: the beast has been beaten
[8:52:10] Emberwish_: GGs
[8:52:10] Pacifistlock: GG though right?!?!/
[8:52:11] Fumbling101: \o/
[8:52:13] Axe_M0: Very noice
[8:52:17] Zumzar97: ggwp
[8:52:25] SazarJr: gg ez

[8:55:03] TDesius: Gary healed 22k
[8:55:05] TDesius: LUL
[8:55:35] TDesius: Would you like to know the sad part?
[8:55:49] TDesius: Briar self healed 21.8k
[8:58:28] TDesius: I sent you another Screenshot for after LUL
[9:00:59] Isquen: Preseason is a shitshow anyways
[9:01:40] popCatter: rengar pretty stronk with new items
[9:02:02] Fumbling101: I haven't won an ARAM against a Rengar since new items came in
[9:02:08] Isquen: Mages eating well, but Assassins eating better :(
[9:03:44] lurkinglettucex_: edge of night?
[9:03:55] Isquen: Edge of night for spellblock, but it doesn't give armor stats
[9:04:06] Isquen: Maybe give that experimental hexplate a go?
[9:04:08] steeps_: death's dance?
[9:04:08] lurkinglettucex_: theirs steraks, immort cringbow
[9:04:09] Fumbling101: Get a Randuin or Frozen Heart
[9:04:23] Fumbling101: I'm being real
[9:04:29] Fumbling101: He does so much dmg a Death's Dance won't cut it
[9:04:48] Isquen: Logging back in to take a peek
[9:05:51] Isquen: Steel Sigil -> Death's Dance
[9:05:57] Isquen: Gives armor and attack damage
[9:06:02] popCatter: sterraks
[9:06:10] lurkinglettucex_: immortal shieldbow gives shield when u hit like 30% same wit sterraks
[9:06:12] Fumbling101: You want health and armor - your passive gives you armor, if you go tabi, a sterak wouldn't be the worst
[9:06:52] Fumbling101: Or just let the botlane deal with him xD
[9:07:30] popCatter: karthus botlane with a bluebuff
[9:07:36] lurkinglettucex_: their is guardiuan angel but idk if u want that
[9:07:55] steeps_: well sterak's can give you burst shield
[9:08:22] Fumbling101: I think sterak is a really good option for this - also helps against Akali
[9:08:25] Isquen: There's also a mageslayer item, let me see what it's called
[9:08:32] Isquen: Not good for rengar though nevermind
[9:08:40] steeps_: yea if he dies with GA, they can just wait on him to respawn for fresh kill, but it's option too
[9:08:48] Fumbling101: Kaif get Sterak - it's great
[9:08:54] Fumbling101: It gives you everything you want
[9:09:13] lurkinglettucex_: maw wouldnt be good if thats what u mean @Isquen or atleast i think it wouldnt, nvm it might since theirs teemo and akali
[9:09:32] steeps_: I can deal with Akali kaifW
[9:09:33] Isquen: Not that one, there's something that gives an even fatter magic damage shield
[9:09:34] Fumbling101: Problem with Maw is it does nothing against Rengar - steraks helps against both
[9:09:43] Fumbling101: @Isquen Rookern?
[9:09:46] Isquen: Yeah, that
[9:09:53] Isquen: Not good for offense though
[9:09:57] steeps_: Maw
[9:10:24] steeps_: but that only when you drop on 30% hp
[9:10:27] lurkinglettucex_: you thinking of a tank item isquen? im blanking out on crownhuard when u said that
[9:10:45] Isquen: I dunno, I play AP nuker supports, I'm out of my element here
[9:11:50] steeps_: tank item force of nature is strong af in fight you can get 125 MR from that one item
[9:12:38] lurkinglettucex_: force of nature is strong but u need be struck wit ap to stack it and their is still a rengar
[9:13:16] steeps_: well you, but if your tank you can build both armor and mr
[9:13:24] steeps_: this don't apply to Kaif tho
[9:14:29] lurkinglettucex_: so, so far we got sterraks it seems and possible shieldbow for survivability
[9:14:49] steeps_: well rooker or sterak's are probably only good options here
[9:16:12] steeps_: well most of their team is ap so rooker seems like better option against burst, but I would probably take maw for that AD and MR
[9:16:47] lurkinglettucex_: truthfully at this point maw might be it, since their are fighting alot rn
[9:17:13] steeps_: man I keep forgetting that here's YT chat
[9:17:51] steeps_: yea sterak's and maw are in order against that burst
[9:18:53] popCatter: cant go both
[9:18:58] lurkinglettucex_: in the end its kaif's choice, itll be hard even if he does get either item since their hole team squish
[9:19:07] steeps_: can't anymore<
[9:19:08] popCatter: their passives are unique
[9:19:11] steeps_: ?
[9:19:18] steeps_: they lock each other out?
[9:19:26] popCatter: ye
[9:19:27] Fumbling101: maw, sterak and shieldbow all share passive, you can't get all of 'em
[9:19:32] steeps_: shame
[9:19:40] popCatter: 'Lifeline'
[9:20:17] steeps_: well then probably shield would be best bet against both AD and AP, although subpar
[9:20:27] steeps_: we will se what will Kaif buy
[9:21:19] popCatter: if it were me
[9:21:25] popCatter: id just grab a randuins
[9:21:26] lurkinglettucex_: biggest threat to them rn seems to be that cc control from pyke
[9:21:29] popCatter: or some armour item
[9:21:42] AssaultPowerX: literal 1 hp
[9:21:48] AssaultPowerX: NotLikeThis
[9:22:04] steeps_: well that drake didn't want to go to you kaifW
[9:22:31] VenomBoio: kindred R can get mobs to 1hp if im not mistaken
[9:22:43] steeps_: Would Graves do more dmg if he was closer to drake or it doesn't matter on target that huge?
[9:23:15] Fumbling101: The larger model helps, but generally he needs to stand close so he hits all the buckshot pellets
[9:23:18] Fumbling101: for max dmg
[9:23:34] Fumbling101: It's why there was a goredrinker build in pro player for a while, was pretty lit
[9:23:36] lurkinglettucex_: i believe he does more dmg if he closer, but kaif might be standing that far to give him option of jumping over wall to run
[9:23:58] steeps_: @lurkinglettucex_ fair point
[9:24:19] lurkinglettucex_: does stormsurge work on karthus ult btw?
[9:24:23] AssaultPowerX: yes
[9:24:25] Fumbling101: yes, but only on one target
[9:24:38] Fumbling101: as in, it can only trigger on one champ
[9:24:42] AssaultPowerX: i still wanna try using stormsurge on full ap morde
[9:24:47] Kusahri: and you like it too..
[9:24:50] steeps_: man played veigar now 1.408k dmg is pretty sick
[9:24:59] AssaultPowerX: need to find the right matchup for it
[9:25:15] steeps_: played against Lee mid lol
[9:25:16] lurkinglettucex_: viegar will always be nasty if he can successfully stack ap and gets deathcap
[9:25:28] Fumbling101: @AssaultPowerX If you start riftmaker, I'd think full AP morde woops most tanks?
[9:25:37] ruimney: they're just too good
[9:25:50] ruimney: nt papa kaif
[9:25:51] steeps_: I almost didn't bought deathcap, cause I had too much of a lead
[9:25:52] AssaultPowerX: true, i keep forgetting i can build riftmaker and rocketbelt
[9:25:55] Kusahri: wondering why you not muting that Teemo
[9:26:01] MelioveRsin: Foken hell that's a classic lol player, tilt when he wins...
[9:26:05] AssaultPowerX: but riftmaker omnivamp doesnt trigger that quickly in short burst heavy trades
[9:26:22] SazarJr: classic Temo
[9:26:45] Fumbling101: @AssaultPowerX You won't burst a tank at any rate, they'd rush rookern into him
[9:27:02] steeps_: man kinda hard game without any kind of engage or frontline
[9:27:11] AssaultPowerX: only smart tanks do that, i dont see those yet in my elo KEKW
[9:27:14] Fumbling101: Doesn't help Ben is gonezo
[9:28:06] lurkinglettucex_: lets see how useful this shieldbow gonna be
[9:28:16] steeps_: man it's a treat bropping only W and Q on morgana or lux as veigar and seeing them dissapear from map with lighting from stormsurge
[9:28:33] Kusahri: alrighty Kaify, why not give us a quick guide on how to graves :3
[9:28:43] steeps_: kaif please kill one jungle camp for that smite
[9:29:00] steeps_: it's triggering my OCD LUL
[9:29:02] lurkinglettucex_: he died but game says he has 98 hp rip
[9:29:09] steeps_: well gg
