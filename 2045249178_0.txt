[9:44:28] midflyer02: @RoninUnbound Most recreational drugs that are abused work through different neurotransmitter receptors. This can be through blocking reuptake of seratonin and dopamine receptors for example, then you can be more susceptiable to addiciton if you for example have a lesser material reality or if you are naturally deprived of these neurotransmittors, then you can develope dependence
