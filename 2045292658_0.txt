[0:29:50] Zulkuss: When Americans can start to drink alcohol at 21, there are Europeans who quit drinking at that age KEKW

[0:30:40] varick_of_skelige: Cheer100 Cheer100 Here is your info how it works. In Eastern Europe and Balkans a lot of families make their own home made spirits called either Paleno or Rakija. And you can either rent a protable still to od it or go to a distillery for a price tehy will make it for you. So no wonder alcohol is everywhere. And yesterday I saw on sale a bottle of beer for 19 cents...alcohol is cheaper than water here kaneko5Soulless

[0:35:47] gerthddyn: Everyone has to have a Hobby. Fishman's is selling coffee.

[1:47:28] gray_badge: It's a fairly common thing
[1:47:29] ojiramen: chicago is more of a hidden scene town than it is a cool place to visit
[1:47:31] sigurturn: People do it and they're giant wimps
[1:47:35] wookietrainer: don‚Äôt want to get hands dirty
[1:47:35] RyanGlazner: Eating pizza with a fork is fine. Some pizza is WAY too overloaded and uneatable.
[1:47:36] mknigh_: its normal
[1:47:36] varick_of_skelige: My mom also does as well due to her implant teeth
[1:47:37] gerthddyn: @Myriarchy Yes yes... it is terrible. No one else come here.

[1:47:55] Juiceboxed: KEKW
[1:48:00] varick_of_skelige: THe fold sounds like a sacrilege
[1:48:02] sunikas: Italians have a lot of protocols when it comes to Italian food
[1:48:03] RyanGlazner: How do you eat that when there's like five toppings?
[1:48:03] LargePad: Lardmi  Stuff it in your face
[1:48:05] uhsque: if you wish to kill an Italian you have to stab a knife and fork through a pineapple pizza on their chest.
[1:48:11] gray_badge: I tried it once just to see what it's like. It can help keep the toppings from falling off
[1:48:15] BakedPotaoes: i think everyone folds the pizza, it's more efficient to eat it that way
[1:48:20] rakutansan: Yes
[1:48:22] mknigh_: yep
[1:48:22] fiignite: Youre a chicagoan by pizza taste
[1:48:22] GeneralvonSaufenberg: @varick_of_skelige When I go to Italy I look for restaurants where locals go to, then do everything to insult them, mainly cut spaghetti with knife and eat them with spoon.

[1:48:49] bumapapaoni: What about Brazilians' Pizza do you have to stab someone. (Joking)
[1:48:49] Tombworld: If you don't have to fold the pizza, the crust is either cardboard or will shatter when you bite it.
