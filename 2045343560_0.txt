[1:13:42] pureiinsanity: wait theres a chance ivenr works
[1:13:57] pureiinsanity: "V13.21 Brushmaker Brushmaker Damage now triggers Ivern's own damage effects but still grants kill credit to the ally applying it."
[1:14:00] pureiinsanity: wtf does this mean

[1:15:17] pureiinsanity: some 1 needs to test it
[1:15:20] yuuuu_y: is it even worth adc-ing this season
[1:16:32] pureiinsanity: well that too
[1:16:38] pureiinsanity: but the notes talked about brushmaker
[1:16:57] deafShiny: While allied champions are in spawned Brushmaker brush, their basic attacks are empowered to deal bonus magic damage On-hit icon on-hit. This bonus persists for 1.5 seconds after leaving brush.
[1:17:11] pureiinsanity: ^
[1:18:01] Gragnoth: gotta test that! :3
[1:18:08] deafShiny: It counts as your damage for the purposes of kill credit.
[1:18:11] Gragnoth: lol, brand jungle gank? XD
[1:18:20] AkitaAttribute: Very fast cause camp clear is fast.
[1:18:28] FrozenLavaReflector: ugh... after 6 i guess
[1:18:28] Gragnoth: @deafShiny same with lulu pix
[1:18:28] AkitaAttribute: I saw a pro game of it, and it dominated.
[1:19:08] AkitaAttribute: Autofilled?
[1:19:22] JustaStoopidDog: its because you asked if he played lulu lol
[1:19:25] Gragnoth: yup, time to farm
[1:19:30] pureiinsanity: i mean even if it works its not better than lulu prob
[1:20:57] FrozenLavaReflector: sheilds
[1:21:07] FrozenLavaReflector: I vern support is just worse lulu support
[1:21:08] BluerBlack: 4hp
[1:21:17] FrozenLavaReflector: its not good
[1:21:39] p_s___: he just doesnt have a passive spell here huh
[1:21:52] taytayabby: catJAM
[1:22:31] AkitaAttribute: They're a top player.  Kennen/Riven main.
[1:22:59] Gragnoth: I mean their name is "God Kennen"
[1:23:29] bentgrassxx: he can give you on hit buff with when you enter any bush around him i think maybe ?

[1:24:22] AkitaAttribute: Maokai woulda been ok
[1:24:38] AkitaAttribute: CDR nerfs kinda make maokai support not great
[1:24:45] Gragnoth: don't forget Nid guys! :3
[1:24:48] ewwii_damncat: is autofilling an option or just something that happens?

[1:55:35] taytayabby: your video about faking weapons was on my recommendations one day, I watched it and immediately started binging all your content
[1:55:36] heyitsmadss: ok thats fair lmao
[1:55:47] FrozenLavaReflector: S14 is probablyvthe best time to get into league in a while
[1:55:55] NamesBond_007: but youre my fave
[1:55:57] taytayabby: then I created my Twitch account a month later to watch you
[1:56:00] Steki_Z: gp monkaHmm

[1:56:41] CoyoteTina: Need to do some more collabs with Jonas, that was fun to be a part of for that Mini Royale thing
[1:56:42] heyitsmadss: i discovered you in among us video #3 and then finally got twitch months later. wasnt active for quite a while after that though.
[1:56:43] lil__soupy: tay! puppyKISS
[1:56:47] FrozenLavaReflector: And litterally everypne else in tge lobby besides his imposter partner believing him
[1:57:05] Shehzni: meeting 5up in solo q was cooler than league streamers cause I watched him all the time at night
[1:57:06] Shehzni: was nice
[1:57:12] Shehzni: I was like no way
[1:57:15] auraizen: i was rewatching really old among us vods last night, eveey once in awhile i miss that era so much
[1:57:25] NamesBond_007: Hi soupy 5upFlower
[1:57:26] Fossabot: 5upFlower 5upFlower 5upFlower
[1:57:46] lil__soupy: @NameStealer007 hellooo 5upFlower
[1:58:02] cameron416: peak covid times were crazy bc why were my coworkers playing among us at work
[1:58:09] lil__soupy: guys i had such a great time shadowing in the er
[1:58:22] Shehzni: Nah streamers are awful to play with unless they dont main league
[1:58:24] taytayabby: @cameron416 I played among us in class lol
[1:58:33] Shehzni: they dont care about the game so they just int
[1:58:39] taytayabby: it was just the practice maps though
[1:58:49] fern_in_a_trenchcoat: I've found you through among us videos over a year ago now and been lurking in the streams for a while now and promised myself to talk at least a little so hi!
[1:58:54] ewwii_damncat: watching 5up being a master manipulator in vanilla among us is something i’ll never get tired of 5upLUL
[1:59:10] FrozenLavaReflector: Yeah... why does gangplabk have to be so lane dominant fpr no reason
[1:59:11] heyitsmadss: hey fern!
[1:59:20] taytayabby: I unironically got very good at being an impostor bc of watching 5up all the time
[1:59:22] cari141: cari141 gifted a Tier 1 sub to fern_in_a_trenchcoat! They have given 381 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:59:30] lil__soupy: @taytayabby i would play pokemon white 2 using an emulator in high school
[1:59:42] NamesBond_007: @ewwii_damncat i love his lil group, the loud loby w boosfer
[1:59:43] taytayabby: even in my troll lobbies my friends didn't trust me
[1:59:48] fern_in_a_trenchcoat: ...thank you!
[1:59:48] Shehzni: What streamer do you see the most in solo q ?
[2:00:05] ewwii_damncat: i love tryharders lmfao
[2:00:23] 007POPE: pop off
[2:00:36] NamesBond_007: not the stealing when you are saving his ass
[2:00:38] 007POPE: Kreygasm
[2:00:49] CoyoteTina: I never could play Among Us like y'all did. It's only fun with discord. The normal way ppl just type a color an say sus, then you get voted out
[2:01:23] taytayabby: public among us is either very fun or extremely toxic Aware
[2:01:30] cameron416: yeah we would play on zoom
[2:01:36] CoyoteTina: I lurk now, gotta go mod 5upWave
[2:01:38] ewwii_damncat: i never got to play among us with voice sadly
[2:01:49] taytayabby: I used to play with my friends through WhatsApp group call
[2:02:01] BluerBlack: Public amongus lobby should be required team leader training session
[2:02:02] ewwii_damncat: oh I havent played in sooo long
[2:02:04] BluerBlack: LUL
[2:02:04] taytayabby: it was so much fun, I kinda miss it
[2:02:05] NamesBond_007: why 3
[2:02:14] ewwii_damncat: i dont think I could get back into it and be good enough
[2:02:43] ctdamon: I think my favorite among us moment is still when you and platySURPRISE reconnected
[2:02:44] taytayabby: I remember sitting in class and some of my friends would tell me that they couldn't wait to get home so we could play among us together lol
[2:03:05] NamesBond_007: @ctdamon oh JEAS
[2:03:31] NamesBond_007: that was so funny being there live
[2:03:31] ctdamon: Lol
[2:03:44] jeskieKAT: YEP
[2:03:45] taytayabby: frrrrrrr
[2:03:51] cameron416: @lil__soupy wait this just registered 5upPog
[2:03:52] taytayabby: it was so much fun at the time
[2:04:09] ctdamon: @namestealer007  the genuine shock from Max
[2:04:14] taytayabby: that was probably my favourite period of time, it was so fun
[2:04:23] heyitsmadss: im so upset because my friends were playing among us and i wasnt there and missed it literally 3 days ago
[2:04:33] xBangerang: The audacity to play among us. Kappa
[2:04:42] lasse_____: Among us is still one of the most entertaining thing to watch imo
[2:04:49] NamesBond_007: @ctdamon jeah, he was not over it still the next time they played together xd
[2:04:58] heyitsmadss: it was for the memes but i wish i was there lmfao
[2:05:04] jeskieKAT: NODDERS
[2:05:11] ewwii_damncat: theres no other game like it imo
[2:05:24] lasse_____: Yeah ofc thats the case
[2:05:28] NamesBond_007: honestly i would love bit of your lethal mania again
[2:05:41] taytayabby: rn I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch
[2:05:43] ctdamon: "Who is this person how do they know my name is Max"
[2:05:56] heyitsmadss: im curious what would have happened if a game like jackbox bought it as a party game type thing
[2:06:02] taytayabby: at least for me personally
[2:07:38] ewwii_damncat: oooo
[2:07:41] ewwii_damncat: i’m curious
[2:07:41] AwesomeTree: hello everyoneee
[2:07:45] NamesBond_007: thanks godsd you stopped yourself
[2:07:48] heyitsmadss: oooooo
[2:07:55] heyitsmadss: wait what did i just spark
[2:08:05] taytayabby: what's this song btw?
[2:08:20] alyahos: i don't think it's public
[2:08:22] auraizen: not that I'm aware but im not up to date
[2:08:28] heyitsmadss: i dont think it is
[2:08:29] AwesomeTree: i feel like ive heard about it but i might be gaslighting myself into thinking that
[2:08:50] heyitsmadss: a quick google suggests no but i have been thinking abt an acquisition for a while
[2:08:58] jeskieKAT: NOTED
[2:09:10] AwesomeTree: cassiopeia really slithers to the beat of that song
[2:09:12] cari141: well it makes sense to buy it
[2:09:16] jeskieKAT: YEP
[2:09:34] heyitsmadss: good job 5up 5upPrime
[2:09:43] Senz: it was me, I sent them an offer of 7.99
[2:09:47] Senz: they declined
[2:09:56] 007POPE: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[2:10:02] heyitsmadss: tbh i was expecting them to be sold for a while and then nothing happened. tbh i feel like they shouldve sold bc is anything happening now?
[2:10:21] taytayabby: yeah there's always some updates or collabs
[2:10:30] taytayabby: if that even counts
[2:11:17] heyitsmadss: updates yes but the game is almost dead and they have no new events that i know of. essentially stagnat
[2:11:31] FrozenLavaReflector: seraphs no?
[2:11:36] taytayabby: yeah as far as events and stuff I don't think much is happening there
[2:11:38] FrozenLavaReflector: with tear finished?
[2:11:44] taytayabby: Lava 5upL
[2:11:58] ewwii_damncat: are/were they a small company?
[2:11:58] FrozenLavaReflector: TAY 5upL 5upWave
[2:11:58] Fossabot: 5upL 5upL 5upL
[2:12:03] AwesomeTree: i feel like they were a bit late with the first updates
[2:12:09] AwesomeTree: could've kept the hype going a bit longer
[2:12:12] BluerBlack: Yep, the best move from game studion was to get bought
[2:12:30] cameron416: things like battepass and roles came too late
[2:12:31] BluerBlack: There is really low chance they will get pop like that again
[2:12:57] taytayabby: thing is, the original code was very meh, so they had to kinda take the time to fix it and stuff to make it less meh (this updated code only released in March 2021)
[2:13:18] taytayabby: and the team was also much smaller at the time I think?
[2:14:08] AwesomeTree: well yeah, but they should've hired more people at that point when they saw how much hype they're getting
[2:14:24] taytayabby: This is just something I remember because when I got the update it actually break the game for me
[2:15:12] AwesomeTree: yall ever think that if cassiopeia had legs she'd look like she's naruto running
[2:15:15] psyfi6: theres never proper documentation or onboarding processes in place to handle increasing your workforce size. you see it happen all the time with games that blow up
[2:15:28] taytayabby: med scan was a common task 😭 ?
[2:15:30] Steki_Z: medscan and weapons with animation POGGERS
[2:15:35] taytayabby: that's so broken lmao
[2:15:35] cameron416: @AwesomeTree 5upBlank
[2:15:39] FrozenLavaReflector: Didnt among us initially come out in 2018, and streamers didnt find it until 2020
[2:15:49] AwesomeTree: @AwesomeTree @cameron416 you know im right
[2:15:56] heyitsmadss: i completely forgot about common med that's crazy
[2:16:07] piekilluxxfuzzy: league was once an indie game
[2:16:14] cameron416: maybe so
[2:16:49] lasse_____: But with all the modding done they should mod different to be common/not each game
[2:17:44] jeskieKAT: 5upNotes
[2:17:49] lasse_____: Yeah but then the devs should not allow modding in the start
[2:17:53] ewwii_damncat: and that goes back to saying they didnt hire people early enough
[2:18:03] taytayabby: yeah
[2:18:08] ewwii_damncat: so the community updates the game themselves
[2:18:16] taytayabby: they were a team of 3 for way too long
[2:18:46] ewwii_damncat: i didnt know they were only 3
[2:18:49] ewwii_damncat: thats crazy
[2:19:41] taytayabby: exactly, that's not much to work with especially for a game that was that popular
[2:19:49] lasse_____: What did they hire blau fore?
[2:19:53] padfootly: i forgot they hired blau lmao
[2:19:57] BluerBlack: Question is how much return they would get from additional devs
[2:19:57] heyitsmadss: pr manager feels like the wrong first move no?
[2:19:59] taytayabby: Pad 5upFlower
[2:19:59] Fossabot: 5upFlower 5upFlower 5upFlower
[2:20:30] padfootly: hewwo 5upL
[2:20:32] lasse_____: Yeah that pr manager must have had the easist job in 2020 -2021 xD
[2:20:36] ewwii_damncat: i mean hiring a pr manager isnt bad but they shouldve hired more than just that
[2:20:54] psyfi6: kayn is my perma ban when i play league lol
[2:20:55] FrozenLavaReflector: red kayn q is % max health damage i believe
[2:21:03] Enma_o: league of lethality

[2:39:00] taytayabby: 5upVent
[2:41:40] taytayabby: 😭
[2:42:11] FrozenLavaReflector: yeah you kinda have no choice but to accept it
[2:42:24] SyntheeR: Is there anything wrong with being an among us guy?
[2:42:32] BluerBlack: I'm still surprised that there isn't 5up version of Sussy
[2:42:58] AwesomeTree: remember that among us streamer you watched in 2020? youll never believe what he's doing now!

[2:44:34] FrozenLavaReflector: okay... but if you ever go on survivor
[2:44:38] Cleophi: my friends have only ever trusted me once in among us and it was when I was actively gaslighting them
[2:44:39] AwesomeTree: imagine having to do a trust fall with 5up
[2:44:43] SyntheeR: That's kinda like being a general in army - some people will try to target you, if they can
[2:44:49] FrozenLavaReflector: also... speaking of survivor... have you watched 45 yet?
[2:44:49] pureiinsanity: @5up Games about trust aka league when you pick Renata APC or Mid
