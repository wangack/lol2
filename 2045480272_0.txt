[1:06:03] Alucard4469: Yeah that's really bad and why I won't play that shit

[1:06:08] inhumanreaction3: cheaters are fun as long as they are not many
[1:06:09] smsteel: You are wrong a lot of games actually have kernel level anti cheat
[1:06:12] Nauqeas: ???
[1:06:14] burdacz: @Sendushi I know but he said it never happened before.. it did.. it is a thing for a long time
[1:06:18] ANewbiePlays: the reason it's not illegal is because the old twats running the world would have no idea what you just said
[1:06:29] AligatorAl: you also can't play the game above 1fps
[1:06:30] AligatorAl: KEKW

[1:06:51] RussianNuke666: @Nightblue3  it's already illegal if you can call it that.
[1:06:54] edmpepe: boot up a virtual box
[1:06:56] SpacedOutCatz: we need law makers that arent over the age of 80 so that we can actually have laws in place fot this BAS
[1:06:58] SpacedOutCatz: BS
[1:07:01] Arosuuu: installing cheats on mac is much more harder than windows
[1:07:04] oxarata: @alexanderthetired yes they can judge u and stuff and it's pretty gross. Btw same goes for credit companies which lend money
[1:07:06] nomitwest: aint no way lilbro has to explain this to you guys again and again
[1:07:11] slick_foxes: So we just wait for the next update to see when vanguard is install to play league
[1:07:16] cosmiconi_shaun: @Nightblue3 do you turn your pc off when your not using it? if so if you arent on league while using it you can just exit vanguard.
[1:07:21] pixelpantsu: what u hiding un ur pc Susge
[1:07:26] snepyv2: a lost of pp mean 10.
[1:07:29] RussianNuke666: Internet has no rules, only the government where the server is
[1:07:40] Alucard4469: @SpacedOutCatz Their age is irrelevant. Who they're beholden to/who they're accepting bribes from is the actual issue
[1:07:41] altair1727: people playing league at work? lol

[1:08:07] Muted_7: maybe the bots too?
[1:08:08] JoshTGW: Vanguard running constantly is suspicious, information collecting illegally?
[1:08:10] edmpepe: we should blame cheaters for this
[1:08:12] ZeBasterd1: The "problem" is that Tencent wants your data KEKW
[1:08:15] fizzkaleefa: @Nightblue3 while you fears are kinda cracked, lets be honest they are trying to stop skin mods since it would be seen as lost revenue
[1:08:16] Mystic3k: get your tin foil hats on boys
[1:08:17] theholybananamonkey: nah they want to sell our data to companies
[1:08:20] RainMaker030: I hecking love bro science
[1:08:23] Alucard4469: @ZeBasterd1 Yes, exactly
[1:08:24] inhumanreaction3: @Nightblue3 when mecha rengar skin gameplay that skin feels deleted from game
[1:08:25] Arosuuu: @JoshTGW its not collecting information lmao
[1:08:31] crispy_rolls: Alternate intention, give backdoor to China for their AI projects Kappa
[1:08:33] SarukyDraico: @Nightblue3 If the person has nothing to hide then why would it be a problem?
[1:08:41] Nauqeas: nightblue has been watching too many conspiracy theory YT vids
[1:08:43] cosmiconi_shaun: i exit vanguard whenever im not playing league its not that big of a deal lol
[1:08:54] RussianNuke666: Doesn't league already have some similar thing?
[1:09:00] Alucard4469: BasedBlue3
[1:09:06] slick_foxes: Prayge for the Modders that made the custom skins

[1:14:49] Galkaria: @GrimVandal one of the best options. streaming PC with only riot games, no other information
[1:14:50] Liquid211: Witch: As far as I know Vanguard has not cleared Valorant of cheaters. So why make it so intrusive if it does not work?
[1:15:04] ZeBasterd1: Shruge

[1:16:29] GrimVandal: I hate Vanguard but for league I like it, because used old pcs are cheap as fuck.
[1:16:30] papagoosh: Bro I just saw a dude randomly inting with disco nunu and getting banned 166 accounts while streaming and cheaters are the problem? @nightblue3
