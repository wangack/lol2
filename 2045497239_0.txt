[1:08:28] Lownwolf560: tanks dont really snowball on their own

[1:47:46] DarthMarnix: Vanguard in general is fine, but it doesn't need to run when I am not playing your game
[1:47:51] TheMadBadger: ^
[1:47:57] Colgaldy: Rootkits are fine, just don't have it on all the time, and make me restart my pc to start it up.
[1:47:59] Harry_DuBois_: Agreed. Thats why I only play SPT
[1:48:13] TheMadBadger: The fact i need to restart my system every time i wanna play is so annoying
[1:48:22] Colgaldy: It also blocks launching other games unless you turn it off.
[1:48:39] Oglino: peepoArrive did he tilt yet?
[1:48:43] Colgaldy: Sometimes
[1:48:51] BlukSmenbard: no tilts yet!

[1:49:17] MadWikked: He'll get there stripEvil
[1:49:19] BlukSmenbard: peepoHappy
[1:49:33] LemiCheck: I don't care about vanguard itself, I just wish riot provided me with a kernel module for linux. so I *could* have the option to play
[1:49:51] Colgaldy: If I could turn it on and off freely I wouldn't mind. But having to restart your pc everytime is a pain in the ass

[3:53:41] Kwuoah: makes me want to hop on il2
[3:53:41] Darchon_: ye @Percussion1
[3:53:47] Devious_gastropod: peepoHey Zeus!
[3:53:54] Percussion1: does not have the same feel it or the pacific did
[3:54:00] Percussion1: those were so much more grounded
[3:54:00] Hobo1001: lawlmanHowdy zeus
[3:54:05] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: Theres no nick jonas to play a made up cahracter though
[3:54:06] Othiren: I hope this trailer isn't representative of the actual show. This really doesn't feel like BoB or even the Pacific
[3:54:12] Hobo1001: bro they dotn have to LuL
[3:54:18] Hobo1001: they have enough chaotic bullshit in ww1 and ww2
[3:54:22] tyrocantus: there were like 5 crazy days
[3:54:25] AnOldNewb: true
[3:54:25] Darchon_: at the same time they never show how horrifying artillery really was
[3:54:27] theowin333: preach
[3:54:27] Oglino: yep
[3:54:36] mii_irl: the pacific was a meat grinder
[3:54:37] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: Thats why Band of Brothers is so good. They just interviewed the played the real people
[3:54:38] Oglino: reality is fucking insane
[3:54:38] DraygoDraygon: Artillery is the scariest fucking thing
[3:54:39] barbadosblackbelly: i think thats why everyone liked band of brothers
[3:54:39] jaxkmurphy: this is based on one of them
[3:54:41] Percussion1: band of brothers did it near perfect with the bastogne episodes
[3:54:41] ParanoiaDelirante: dunkirk was a very grounded wwII movie with high stakes
[3:54:45] KaiGoesMoo: It's more terrifying suddenly getting lit up by a fighter you DON'T SEE CAUSE IT'S FREAKING TINY
[3:54:52] Kduff89: Dunkirk still blows my mind. Not the movie but the actual historical event
[3:54:52] theowin333: 100% what bothers me about modern ww2 media too
[3:54:56] NameThatIsAMeme: @Darchon_ abnd of brothers had a great episode about them just getting their asses shelled
[3:55:03] Fynagle: Not even back then, there are plenty of stories of times we almost nuked ourselves purely out of accidents and mismanagement.
[3:55:21] CompulsiveOne: 9 episodes
[3:55:23] Shu7tle: series
[3:55:24] AQUAMOO: guess its time to make another free apple tv account to delete after watching this

[3:55:32] Percussion1: looks way too hollywooded up
[3:55:36] MCManon: it's like band of brothers, but with airforce
[3:55:36] Darchon_: @Darchon_ yeah, best depiction of ww2 there is
[3:55:47] DoubleGambit13: I'm going to take this moment to complain about how bad Catch 22 was and how it missed the point of the book completely

[4:02:40] Hobo1001: WE SMURT NODDERS
[4:02:44] EvilEden: lookUp got moon 6 today
[4:02:48] Fynagle: She thought lunar phases were all SEPARATE MOONS?
[4:03:02] Oglino: agreed
[4:03:02] DraygoDraygon: @Fynagle That's why they look different smile
[4:03:04] Percussion1: @NexiKuro true, its like finance but instead you just make shit up
[4:03:08] Hobo1001: @Lawlman what you mean i literally saw the moon eat the sun a month ago
[4:03:08] Gahnzo: By moon bigger in sky
[4:03:10] Darchon_: Nationwide, on average, 79% of U.S. adults are literate in 2022.
[4:03:13] Devious_gastropod: did she only look up 12 days every month?!?
[4:03:18] Hobo1001: moon has to be bigger NODDERS

[4:03:36] Hobo1001: you will  also see the moon eat the sun on april 8th Lawlman NODDERS i will show you moon > sun
[4:03:46] SnailintheShell: Half the country thinks getting things for free with no strings is bad. Its not that hard to believe to be honest.
[4:03:51] uppenchamp: Agreed
[4:03:51] oddball3000: I even clarified not phase but number of moons
[4:03:54] MadCat27: I try to check my privilige and not judge people since education isn't as high quality across the board as we think, but it gets real hard sometimes.
[4:03:55] barbadosblackbelly: how do they like, use the internet
[4:03:56] Gahnzo: Agreed
[4:03:57] Oglino: yep
[4:03:58] Darchon_: true and based
[4:04:01] DoubleGambit13: There is a good reason we got rid of those quizzes though
[4:04:03] Oglino: no you are based as fuck
[4:04:04] DraygoDraygon: If there's tests to vote its always skewed against minorties though
[4:04:05] Othiren: I think there should be a quiz to lead more so than to vote
[4:04:08] PatbTV: there should be tests for a lot of things. Make people retake their driving test every 5 years
[4:04:09] Percussion1: I'll settle for ranked choice
[4:04:10] Gahnzo: LUL
[4:04:11] Egomaniacalhero: We got rid of those test for a reason
[4:04:13] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: The end result of that logic is then who gets to make the test? The sitting president each year?
[4:04:14] KaiGoesMoo: Just 1 question: Is the moon bigger than the sun?
[4:04:14] OafALoaf: see the reason thats unconstitutional is because that same idea was used to oppress freed slaves
[4:04:15] SnailintheShell: They tried that, it was to keep black people from voting.
[4:04:17] uppenchamp: That's not partisan
[4:04:21] TheAntLion: the literacy thing might be skewed by esl though
[4:04:22] ZeusLair: what if you think you know about it :)
[4:04:25] Morphogum: yea but how can you elect your flat-earther president if there was? Madge
[4:04:26] DraygoDraygon: Yeah we used to have those because it was suppressing minorities
[4:04:32] Chardanak: KKona careful there brother, sounding awfully tyrannical there
[4:04:35] Kwuoah: ill just wait for our future ai overlords to tell me what to do
[4:04:35] Greywyn00: then we just gut education so only elites get to vote crikPlot
[4:04:36] DraygoDraygon: And historically always is
[4:04:37] BlukSmenbard: the issue is agreeing exactly what people 'should' know
[4:04:42] Falling321: I 100% think that would raise the collective IQ of american voters
[4:04:44] BlukSmenbard: interesting idea tho
[4:04:48] Shu7tle: it funny that ppl cannot know sizes of planets vs stars. then they do know what celeb did during the weekend.
[4:04:56] Fynagle: You should look up what the Civil War was called based on state educational system, that was an eye-opener to me.
[4:04:56] Moobot: Roc is here for two things and two things only. Your channel points, and soul.
[4:04:56] jaxkmurphy: crazy how much that has probably 180 to affecting white Americans more LUL
[4:05:04] Ace_335: you wouldn't let someone in grade 5 vote, so why let someone with a grade 5 education.
[4:05:08] Guhnat: KKona ITS MY RIGHT
[4:05:11] waroson: maybe it shouldn't be
[4:05:12] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: Not just horrible history. Horrible implications. Who gets to make the test?
[4:05:13] Grognog: Fast track to a civil war to be honest
[4:05:15] Hobo1001: KKona hell yeah brother
[4:05:19] DraygoDraygon: Yeah what pippinpaddleopsicopoles said
[4:05:20] omgwhatlolz: I think it would help more to pump more tax dollars in to public education
[4:05:29] Guhnat: I get to make the test :)
[4:05:47] Hobo1001: is brand their jungle LuL
[4:05:47] NexiKuro: I mean it's not their fault that they're moron's, the American education system has been thoroughly destroyed
[4:05:47] Moobot: Don't forget to drink water, especially you @lawlman! >:(
[4:05:50] Hobo1001: holy fuck
[4:05:51] Percussion1: telling you man, ranked choice
[4:05:56] Percussion1: solves so many problems
[4:05:58] mattband: I mean world powers have risen and fallen out of infighting
[4:05:59] Birdvr_: you're going DOWN in the league tournament mr man! meow
[4:06:02] Shu7tle: rank votes is the way.
[4:06:02] jaxkmurphy: @lawlman if anything it would show how much lies and propaganda people buy into instead of you know the truth LUL
[4:06:05] DraygoDraygon: Germany's voting system seems pretty great
[4:06:09] CompulsiveOne: good one bird LUL
[4:06:10] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @Percussion1 now THIS is something we desperately need. That and more parties
[4:06:11] ToutedDjinn: bird meow
[4:06:21] DraygoDraygon: Its a TYPE of ranked choice IIRC?
[4:06:22] NexiKuro: just get a full popular vote first
[4:06:30] waroson: that works well if you have more than two parties
[4:06:31] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq
[4:06:35] Devious_gastropod: I think graduating HS or having a GED is the qualification to vote, and that graduating should be more difficult.
[4:06:35] NexiKuro: states don't deserve rights
[4:06:35] Fynagle: Fun fact; Before the two-party system was established when Presidential elections happened the winner would be President and the runner-up would be Vie-President.
[4:06:43] bearonvonbear: Dance 󠀀
[4:06:48] Oglino: Dance

[4:06:59] Hobo1001: danse
[4:07:03] ItsGani: no hands :(
[4:07:06] BlukSmenbard: yeah hard to do a ranked vote when theres only 2 options tbh
[4:07:06] jaxkmurphy: @devious_gastropod you have a poverty problem then so that’s not an option
[4:07:09] BlueOokashi: I can't hear the lyrics that well but its got a nice beat danse LUL
[4:07:13] bandit0424: @Fynagle tbf though I think that practice only lasted the first few decades of the country
[4:07:17] Grognog: @Devious_gastropod Don't piss off rural communities and farmers. That always ends badly
[4:07:29] Colgaldy: I think about it every election cycle
[4:07:29] Darchon_: @Lawlman I started the video... they keep saying astrology stripBruh
[4:07:30] Ace_335: I have a family member who thinks you should need a license to have kids
[4:07:39] DraygoDraygon: A lot of it is because our education system has been sabotaged
[4:07:44] ramspaz: The guy I like is my number 1 and the guy I don't is my number 2 options. That is it if we did that lmao.
[4:07:44] KronSyrup: we're dumb as hell, and we still removed the SAT
[4:07:45] Hobo1001: you should AceGaming335 LuL
[4:07:49] jaxkmurphy: stuff you do not need to go to school for to know

[4:07:52] Oglino: OMEGALUL
[4:07:54] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: Its not just America.(although im definitely not defending our education system) PEOPLE are just fucking stupid when polled en mass

[4:08:04] theowin333: goldmanLUL
[4:08:08] NexiKuro: @Darchon_ that's nmot their fault, astrogoly as a name got stolen Sadge
[4:08:10] Devious_gastropod: @Grognog I just think that the level of education has deteriorated significantly in the last 60 years
[4:08:18] DraygoDraygon: It has, by design
[4:08:20] Darchon_: @Darchon_ ooh, didn't know that!
[4:08:24] theowin333: Man this is both highly entertaining and depressing at the same time
[4:08:30] Percussion1: i propose an amendment to elect faker as president
[4:08:33] Devious_gastropod: @jaxkmurphy How does that cause a poverty problem?
[4:08:34] Hobo1001: i get them not knowing how many stars are in our galaxy but not knowing the moon is smaller th an the sun is criminal
[4:08:34] jaxkmurphy: @devious_gastropod I mean in places in America that’s literally on purpose
[4:08:35] Hobo1001: Smadge
[4:08:40] DraygoDraygon: @Percussion1 Stop that
[4:08:41] Oglino: faker for president peepoCheer
[4:08:43] Hobo1001: CHAT STOP WATCHING IT
[4:08:44] Hobo1001: THAT IS CONTENT
[4:08:45] Grognog: @Devious_gastropod I would imagine that the reverse is actually true. It's just our perception range has massively increased
[4:08:45] Hobo1001: Smadge
[4:08:46] Devious_gastropod: @jaxkmurphy very true
[4:08:47] NexiKuro: NO I WANT A REACTION
[4:08:48] Darchon_: @Darchon_ you're right, the original greek means study of the start pogg cool fact
[4:08:48] Hobo1001: TURN IT OFF
[4:08:50] Hobo1001: Smadge

[4:08:55] Darchon_: @Darchon_ stars*
[4:08:58] NexiKuro: Smadge
[4:08:58] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @Devious_gastropod You mean the trickle down economics has left the majority of people uneducated and worse off? Huh, who coulda though
[4:09:13] jaxkmurphy: @devious_gastropod not everyone who doesn’t graduate hs is because they can’t pass the tests some people can’t afford to
[4:09:13] Greywyn00: Reagan...
[4:09:32] ramspaz: What drives me crazy I watched a video were people couldn't find Iowa on the map. Like Americans not other people.
[4:09:40] Percussion1: i mean its iowa
[4:09:42] Hellifyoudont66: To be fair, it's Iowa.
[4:09:47] DraygoDraygon: Imma be honest, I don't know where a lot of states are and I'm Floridian
[4:09:48] LemiCheck: Who cares about Iowa anyway
[4:09:48] Percussion1: they dont want to be on the map
[4:09:49] Devious_gastropod: @jaxkmurphy I am aware. I guess I should express that I don't believe in this system, but If I had to make one, it would be this
[4:09:50] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @ramspaz It is a forgettable state
[4:09:51] DraygoDraygon: But also I don't really care
[4:09:55] Greywyn00: tbf who cares where iowa is
[4:09:55] waroson: where is Iowa
[4:09:56] Hobo1001: jaxkmurphy and not everyone who graduates highschool actually graduated they just got no child left behinded Shruge
[4:09:57] Oglino: who the fuck knows where iowa is
[4:10:03] BlukSmenbard: i liked the one where that woman thought Kentucky was just a food not a state
[4:10:05] Fynagle: @ramspaz I saw a video where average Americans on the street couldn't find the U.S. on a world map.
[4:10:14] Darchon_: @ramspaz as a non-american, flyover states are hard LUL
[4:10:17] iAlike: @BlukSmenbard OMEGALUL

[4:11:00] jaxkmurphy: lawlchan obviously
[4:11:00] Oglino: Ok
[4:11:00] Grognog: @Devious_gastropod Always worth seeing if its been tried before. Most things have. An obvious parallel would be the romans and their republic oligarchy type situation. Elites voting for elites sort of thing
[4:11:01] Kwuoah: Sludge im an alcoholic
[4:11:02] xxghostx23xx: My god
[4:11:05] BlukSmenbard: ouch

[4:11:09] Onedavewreckingcrew: im not at the bar so the question is moot
[4:11:10] bandit0424: @Hobo1001 yeah when school funds are penalized when grad rates go down, its like all of a sudden theres a perverse incentive to pass everyone
[4:11:10] Darchon_: "no clue, I'm drunk af"
[4:11:11] theowin333: Shruge

[4:11:18] Gahnzo: Smile and drink more
[4:11:20] TinyLeviathyn: remove public schools. we had the highest literacy rate being taught at home
[4:11:22] jaxkmurphy: pay teachers more and stop school shootings easy

[4:11:31] ItsGani: Bring farming and agriculture to the forefront of early education
[4:11:32] Ace_335: ban private schooling to force rich families to put money towards public schooling
[4:11:33] sadstruggle: moon is bigger
[4:11:37] Hellifyoudont66: Guarantee housing and food for life, then we start teaching everybody from scratch again.
[4:11:38] Ryoshin15: Copy what the top most educated places are doing idk.
[4:11:39] bearonvonbear: decouple school funding from local property taxes, increase teacher pay
[4:11:43] Grognog: Copy someone else who's system works better but arent too different from us
[4:11:43] TinyLeviathyn: @acegaming335 literally no
[4:11:49] bitterspring: ask my wife why she is talking about america when we live in australia?
[4:11:50] PunIntentionall: Im going to take the hot take here and say you probably cant bc the population as a whole doesnt care/doesnt want it yet
[4:11:50] Colgaldy: Unfortunately in the current political climate it isn't possible so we would have to begin with political reform
[4:11:52] Fynagle: How to reform education now? It's infeasible at this point, you're talking a ground-up restructuring and that won't be happening.
[4:11:53] BlukSmenbard: maybe call them an ambulance if they have a bad concussion
[4:11:55] Devious_gastropod: @Grognog I just feel like HS graduate / GED isn't "Elite", but I understand it would prevent people from voting
[4:11:56] ItsGani: farming can be the backdrop to learn maths, history and science
[4:11:56] mattband: don’t have an American education. leave the country.
[4:12:07] waroson: @TinyLeviathyn @AceGaming335 you should kiss

[4:12:26] theowin333: damn that Janna doe
[4:12:30] Hobo1001: bearonvonbear lawlmanHowdy
[4:12:31] Greywyn00: control mages :)
[4:12:32] Shu7tle: If I were you I would talk to Hasanabi about this stuff his ideas are pretty good.
[4:12:33] CompulsiveOne: lost would be proud
[4:12:36] theowin333: saved that Brands ass
[4:12:55] NexiKuro: @Grognog it is elite in the US is the problem
[4:13:05] waroson: just call Hasan
[4:13:12] DraygoDraygon: Just call him up 4Head
[4:13:12] Harry_DuBois_: Our education system was built to prepare people for subservience in a factory, and maybe shouldn't be propped up in a way that consolidates power.
[4:13:15] Darchon_: oh god not the political streamers PLEASE
[4:13:15] Othiren: All streamers know each other, right?
[4:13:16] Hobo1001: just call him 4Head
[4:13:23] Shu7tle: I think hasan has a video on his yuutube
[4:13:33] Shu7tle: that talks about the school system in the states
[4:13:37] Grognog: @NexiKuro That's the human problem period.
[4:14:04] Fynagle: Fiora's earned having their pings listened to I think.
[4:14:28] bitterspring: As a teacher in Australia i think the problems are similar. The social contract that existed in the past that you would send your kids to school with some basic concepts of acceptable behavior and resilience  has broken down. Also overworked teachers.
[4:14:31] Greywyn00: went from 1-5 to 6-7 Sadge
[4:14:38] Devious_gastropod: @Grognog I mean, I'm literally a HS dropout. I feel like the no child left behind situation we are in isn't about educating students, and about making our numbers look better
[4:15:33] Dozyderp: i have no problem losing a lane if it gives the jungler breathing room to yoink objectives
[4:15:56] CompulsiveOne: graves modCheck
[4:16:02] NexiKuro: buff arcane man is so mean Sadge
[4:16:05] bitterspring: So much of teaching is now about behavior management at the expense of students who can regulate there behavior. Just left my last job because i was being assulted on a daily basis with one child
[4:16:22] waroson: school is lame, why did my teacher never teach me how to stall minions?
[4:16:23] theowin333: Feel like theres gotta be a good base, starting with preschool.
[4:16:31] BlukSmenbard: goo goo gaga
[4:16:46] BlukSmenbard: me or the dawg?
[4:16:46] Ace_335: when i was in highschool we had kids learning how to write their names in grade 9/10 ELA
[4:16:46] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[4:16:47] Grognog: @Devious_gastropod Number go up is a major problem for sure as it becomes less about the actual worthiness of results but arguing about measurement specifications
[4:16:49] Blocka1564: I think a big problem with U.S. education is its more about memorization rather than actual learning, so more than half the time people forget the skills they we're "taught."
[4:16:59] Dozyderp: ok but if a girl has dad jokes you slap a ring on that

[4:18:17] lorrik0: @TinyLeviathyn but also only 6 million people lived in America
[4:18:34] Dozyderp: its weird, academically i understand how azir works, but the second i try and play him my brain crashes

[4:18:40] bitterspring: @lorrik0 80% of all statistics are made up, everyone knows that!
[4:18:51] Shu7tle: Most schools in NA only care about graduation numbers. they don't care if you learn something, at that in NA.
[4:19:04] Fynagle: @Dozyderp That happens with me when I try to play Irelia or Poppy. Something just doesn't click.
[4:19:04] Oglino: Dance
[4:19:19] Grognog: Lies, damn lies and statistics.

[4:37:06] GebisGaming: I WILL DIE ON THAT HILL
[4:37:12] NPSJason: tbf in the last two decades we went from 'there should be planets out there' to 'theres some out there' to 'holy shit there's so fucking many planets what the fu-'

[4:38:23] BoneBudgie: niel killed pluto
[4:38:32] NPSJason: also tbf the moon is surprisingly close to being a planet, just a little more mass and we'd be a binary planet system
[4:38:32] BlukSmenbard: no triangle moon
[4:38:35] NexiKuro: TFW you're a small star in a binary system and you're technically a planet
[4:38:35] mwednesday: Neil Smadge
[4:38:37] Dozyderp: where were you when they shot pluto
[4:38:40] Colgaldy: Yeah, no other planetoids in it's orbit

[4:39:14] Hobo1001: NOTED
[4:39:17] Kwuoah: they set universe size to small
[4:39:18] Dozyderp: and that number keeps going up
[4:39:20] waroson: NASA is slacking tbh
[4:39:21] KaiGoesMoo: Honestly I thought the number was bigger
[4:39:29] irish451: Wait wait wait....I'm round, I've cleared my neighborhood, and I technically rotate the sun.....am I a planet?
[4:39:32] DraygoDraygon: Yeah I thought we were in tens of thousands
[4:39:33] gingaginge: i expected more than 5k
[4:39:35] BoneBudgie: did you guess 4999
[4:39:45] stiilec: lol a couple thousand that we have SEEN, theres obviously trillions out there
[4:39:46] GreatThane: D:
[4:39:47] Oglino: NODDERS yeh
[4:39:48] Hobo1001: chat 5k we have observed currently
[4:39:57] DraygoDraygon: irish451 How did you "clear" your neighborhood? Susge
[4:40:02] Colgaldy: The number IS bigger, we KNOW there are more we just haven't observed them. But we aren't really trying either
[4:40:02] BoneBudgie: ok hold on I am more intelligent than a college student
[4:40:03] ToeKnee147: known vs. estimate
[4:40:03] waroson: how many was it 10 years ago?
[4:40:04] KaiGoesMoo: Yea I figured we've observed way more
[4:40:16] tyrocantus: we know a shit ton of celestial bodies but we gotta confirm they are a planet/star/ giant space monster
[4:40:18] NPSJason: actually seeing planets is really hard because stars are huge and bright and planets are small and...not
[4:40:23] mwednesday: Im different GIGACHAD

[4:40:38] Ryoshin15: LUL
[4:40:45] DraygoDraygon: Sun MUCH bigger
[4:40:45] Oglino: OMEGALUL
[4:40:45] stiilec: 8 earths? thats like 3 moons?
[4:40:45] Samal_Law: thats like the moons to earth maybe
[4:40:56] TinyLeviathyn: it’s almost 11 earths if I remember correctly
[4:41:05] BlukSmenbard: that guy was self aware monkaS
[4:41:11] DraygoDraygon: Stars are real dense fuckers
[4:41:12] Grognog: Oh its fucky
[4:41:17] AdmiralCrashyMcSploady: a lot of planets were found by dimming the light of the host star as they pasted
[4:41:19] kristi094: The sun is so big
[4:41:19] Goobydewby: Sun is dummy thicc
[4:41:22] Ryoshin15: Yeah that's interesting.

[4:41:29] BoneBudgie: sun is DENSE
[4:41:34] Shu7tle: we good
[4:41:38] Shu7tle: she a knower
[4:41:38] mii_irl: can we quantify the mass of a blackhole?
[4:41:41] Pymurin: now, consider that our sun isn't even that big as far as stars go
[4:41:45] ParanoiaDelirante: at least these people are humble enough to recognize they're stupid, have you seen those old videos about random people on NYC getting asked stuff about foreign countries? they'd straight up refuse to belive they're wrong
[4:41:55] waroson: you can picture it by comparing volumes of liquids too
[4:42:01] DraygoDraygon: Buncha different solar systems is more or less it yeah
[4:42:02] NPSJason: it's funny because people see youtube videos about how big stars get, and they think our sun is 'small' in stellar scale, but it's still in the top 10% of observable stars in terms of mass at least, probably higher than that
[4:42:04] Dozyderp: how many? yes

[4:44:20] NexiKuro: Stars?
[4:44:21] waroson: we gotta have more trees
[4:44:21] lorrik0: trees
[4:44:22] chasebeneg: I’ve heard that the stars are made of trees
[4:44:22] dumbobash1: Whos counting ?
[4:44:25] BlueOokashi: monkaS
[4:44:26] stiilec: it sounds so wrong but trees
[4:44:26] KronSyrup: we chopped down like 100 billion trees last year
[4:44:30] DraygoDraygon: I miss League Sadge
[4:44:34] BlukSmenbard: we chopped down all the trees
[4:44:39] mii_irl: Im pretty sure there are more stars than grains of sand
[4:44:41] BlueOokashi: We've chopped down so many trees
[4:44:42] Fritular: yo
[4:44:43] ParanoiaDelirante: WHAT
[4:44:43] Grognog: Bloody hell
[4:44:44] Ryoshin15: Sick af.
[4:44:45] Hobo1001: oh yeah then @Lawlman are there more wheels or doors ezz

[4:44:47] Don_Savik: trees won? damn
[4:44:47] Oglino: YEP
[4:44:50] BlueOokashi: DAMN OK!!
[4:44:50] BoneBudgie: yeah right
[4:44:51] Fritular: and they say that deforestation is a problem
[4:44:53] OafALoaf: more ants than trees though, ants stay winning
[4:44:54] Ace_335: 3 trillion trees vs 1 billion lions
[4:44:55] EvilEden: trees got hands
[4:44:56] TinyLeviathyn: most are in Canada too
[4:45:00] Shu7tle: who keep track of how many trees
[4:45:04] Shu7tle: what job is that?
[4:45:04] OafALoaf: wheels
[4:45:05] Greywyn00: wheels
[4:45:11] FeatherRun: 1 blade of grass has 300 miles of roots
[4:45:12] waroson: @Shu7tle ants and birds
[4:45:14] CompulsiveOne: def doors EZ
[4:45:14] Moobot: Kings is watching, always

[4:45:15] NexiKuro: It's wheels
[4:45:16] BlukSmenbard: @Shu7tle Das Tree Counter
[4:45:21] Oglino: doors yeh
[4:45:24] Kwuoah: the void monkaS
[4:45:26] Ryoshin15: Space.
[4:45:28] Grognog: @Shu7tle The druids
[4:45:30] Dozyderp: empty space, and various gasses
[4:45:33] dumbobash1: Science lol guesswork
[4:45:35] crabemporer: there are only 100 billion trees in the galaxy but the only star I see is you looking ass
[4:45:40] BlukSmenbard: all types of vastness
[4:45:42] Colgaldy: Practically nothing between them IIRC
[4:45:46] Samal_Law: big set-up
[4:45:46] CompulsiveOne: pretty big NODDES
[4:45:47] Morphogum: hmm
[4:45:51] CompulsiveOne: NODDERS
[4:45:53] BlukSmenbard: pretty big
[4:45:55] BlukSmenbard: LUL
[4:45:56] AdmiralCrashyMcSploady: there are rouge planets but mostly empty
[4:46:16] waroson: its clusters
[4:46:21] TinyLeviathyn: it’s also all a pretty big guess too. our age doubled from 13b to 27ish billion
[4:46:25] Dozyderp: the V O I D
[4:46:32] Ryoshin15: Even more so because the universe is expanding.
[4:46:33] Oglino: yeh
[4:46:36] NPSJason: @Lawlman look up a video on bootes void and you get some real existential shit
[4:46:44] waroson: there isn't allot of stuff
[4:46:48] GoVols: its constantly expanding
[4:46:48] Dozyderp: @NPSJason isn't it growing?
[4:46:49] YacYac: Try imagining what it's gonna be like when our galaxy smashes our neighbor in like, a trillion billion years or whatever.
[4:46:51] CokedupChocobo: Almost as empty as my head
[4:46:56] kristi094: nope and they are expanding away
[4:47:01] FilthySerf: all that free real estate
[4:47:01] mattband: the void is in fact the void
[4:47:07] Oglino: its so fucking empty
[4:47:13] Green0wl: We're really just dots of yuck floating around in the unwashed cup of life
[4:47:13] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[4:47:17] Moobot: Thanks for joining the table, CokedupChocobo!
[4:47:19] ApeTheChimp: i thought people speculated that the big bang was a collision of two galaxies
[4:47:20] AdmiralCrashyMcSploady: looking up galactic super clusters is nuts
[4:47:24] kristi094: Trillions galaxy in the universe
[4:47:25] EvilEden: good answer
[4:47:26] Hobo1001: 12
[4:47:27] Hobo1001: OMEGALUL
[4:47:29] Chardanak: HYPERS what's even more wacky is that our local galactic cluster is surrounded by nothingness
[4:47:29] waroson: we dont know
[4:47:30] Hobo1001: fucking 12
[4:47:31] BoneBudgie: what is the universe trying to hide
[4:47:32] Korgon297: OMEGALUL 12 Price is right rules
[4:47:32] Oglino: OMEGALUL
[4:47:46] mattband: 12?…
[4:47:48] omgwhatlolz: fun fact about space. there is no center to space. it was all created at the same time and is expanding in all directions at the same time
[4:47:50] DunzoLuvsTurtles: :) probably like 8 or something
[4:47:51] Korgon297: OMEGALUL 20 GIRL

[4:47:52] waroson: bro
[4:47:54] Othiren: @Korgon297 Actually accurate LUL
[4:47:55] NPSJason: one of the crazy things is that, some of the stars you see at night, are actually galaxies on the other side of the universe which are so bright they look like stars
[4:47:58] Dozyderp: this girl is on some advanced stupid
[4:48:01] Don_Savik: some people are awful at conceptualizing

[4:48:31] stiilec: @Lawlman look up "the great attractor" mind blowing stuff
[4:48:34] Grognog: That's the teacher nod of "You're wrong but I appreciate you trying, keep doing that"
[4:48:42] waroson: infinite bro

[4:49:18] mattband: more then 1
[4:49:19] Percussion1: EARTH BABY WOO
[4:49:19] Morphogum: too big a number that we can name
[4:49:23] OafALoaf: One: AMERICA KKONA
[4:49:24] tyrocantus: 0, this galaxy is a FAKE

[4:49:52] BlukSmenbard: @omgwhatlolz peepoChess
[4:49:55] AdmiralCrashyMcSploady: oh observeable
[4:49:59] EvilEden: that only observable universe
[4:50:00] Othiren: MONKE Too big for my monke brain to observe, 1 is plenty
[4:50:00] BlueOokashi: Observable ok!
[4:50:02] waroson: that is our bubble yeah
[4:50:04] TinyLeviathyn: @shemg this guy gets it
[4:50:06] Hobo1001: 1/10th of your number LuL
[4:50:11] Dozyderp: the amazing thing to think about is all this stuff is just out there, existing. right now. look out your window. thats the universe out there
[4:50:13] BoneBudgie: no aliens tho
[4:50:13] NPSJason: that's excluding theories like dark galaxies, antigalaxies, and galaxies beyond the observable field
[4:50:18] kristi094: He is wrong. It is a Trillion estimated
[4:50:19] darkrhulad: it's estimated that there are between 200 billion and 2 trillion
[4:50:23] TinyLeviathyn: no1UMM
[4:50:30] chasebeneg: that’s crazy, there’s got be aliens out there
[4:50:33] KronSyrup: those trillion starts must mean there's at least like 20 moons they're orbiting around!
[4:50:37] omgwhatlolz: @Lawlman have you seen what the observable universe looks like. weve got blind spots because of asstroid belt
[4:50:42] iAlike: Max render distance
[4:50:46] waroson: @chasebeneg imagine there isn't
[4:50:51] BlukSmenbard: @chasebeneg imagine if we are actually alone tho
[4:50:53] Hobo1001: yeah but @Lawlman how big is the moon NODDERS
[4:50:55] BoneBudgie: ok so how many trees is that
[4:51:01] Dozyderp: and considering the universe is expanding, there's more shit out there past how far we can see
[4:51:06] Pymurin: the numbers are so huge that it is fact that somewhere in the universe, by sheer random chance, there is an exact copy of earth and all of us
[4:51:22] BlueOokashi: Honestly this is so cool to learn deeper about
[4:51:22] Percussion1: ok but how many galaxies have family guy
[4:51:32] Dozyderp: @Pymurin Jebaited
[4:51:33] BoneBudgie: ^
[4:51:34] Oglino: I dont believe that
[4:51:34] Othiren: Yes EZ
[4:51:35] mattband: it’s at the point of number why even care to no.
[4:51:36] Ace_335: makes you feel tiny ppL
[4:51:37] cavetroll911: All of that Universe size and we barely will leave our solar cluster.
[4:51:42] Kwuoah: NO im the only me Madge
[4:51:46] BlukSmenbard: nah thats not fact LUL
[4:51:53] ExNoctis: statistically likely sure, fact no
[4:51:53] kristi094: So many planets and yet. We are alone Sadge
[4:51:54] Oglino: for sure
[4:51:56] Digdudewhat: ive seen men in black we are in the marble
[4:51:56] darkrhulad: all of them
[4:51:56] Othiren: Oh for sure
[4:51:57] TinyLeviathyn: I’d rather people know about our history more than this space info. I’ve met multiple 20 yr olds that don’t know when viet nam happened
[4:51:59] Percussion1: dark forest hypothesis
[4:51:59] Grognog: And how sexy are they?
[4:52:02] BlueOokashi: Oh definitely
[4:52:04] waroson: probably a lot of crabs and crocodiles
[4:52:06] Kirmle: And how far away are they
[4:52:07] FeatherRun: Just because there's a chance of something doesn't mean it ever will
[4:52:10] Oglino: no fucking way we're the only life in the universe
[4:52:11] OafALoaf: our scenario is a lot less rare than we thought, we are learning
[4:52:12] Korgon297: how many other galaxies have Skibidi Toilet? stripSmug Checkmate nerds
[4:52:13] JoePatzilla: I think there wa s a quote, if theres a planet 80 light yerars away ,m they are just seeing us fighting ww2 ?
[4:52:15] Ryoshin15: Yeah I refuse to believe we're made of common stuff and still be the only life out there.
[4:52:15] Moobot: Use Code 'LAWL' for 10% off your GamerSupps! or Click Here: https://gamersupps.gg/LAWL
[4:52:16] keepitsloshy: That's what the Drake Equation exists for
[4:52:17] DoubleGambit13: Probably millions exist, and basically none will ever meet another because the universe is fuck-off hugs
[4:52:17] KaiGoesMoo: Life might be common, but WE'RE SO FAR AWAY PepeHands
[4:52:19] Kwuoah: i wanna see some non carbon based lifeforms
[4:52:21] mattband: the Fermi paradox moment
[4:52:21] Don_Savik: crabs are the highest lifeform
[4:52:21] DoubleGambit13: *huge
[4:52:21] mokitheking: dark forest is a scary idea
[4:52:22] Green0wl: All will become Crab.
[4:52:23] KaiGoesMoo: monkaS
[4:52:24] waroson: it's the perfect shape
[4:52:25] Dozyderp: statistically, the conditions for life in some form are likely common, but life near enough for us to detect? who knows
[4:52:25] KaiGoesMoo: what now
[4:52:27] Oglino: same
[4:52:27] Ace_335: micro organisms are totally out there
[4:52:27] NPSJason: the problem is, when we look up asking 'where are they', we should be asking 'where were they' because we're looking for aliens thousands, tends of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years ago, if not way, way more
[4:52:28] Burning_Blade17: Saaaame
[4:52:30] omgwhatlolz: dude I bet theres a sexy universe out there
[4:52:31] Stephooon: yeah on universe scale it sounds common
[4:52:34] Devious_gastropod: bossman wants to be driven mad with knowledge of the universe
[4:52:34] VinnyDebs: I wanna see some sexy unknowable horrors
[4:52:35] stiilec: @Lawlman look up "the great attractor", theres something pulling 100's of thousands of galaxies towards it and we dont know what it is
[4:52:36] FilthySerf: there might be a lot of primitive life that we dont know about because theyre primitive and cant draw attention to themselves, much like how we once to be primitive
[4:52:39] mwednesday: Lawlchan exists out there
[4:52:39] BoneBudgie: there is a planet out there where dinosaurs were actually real
[4:52:40] crabemporer: We gotta find the life on other planets and kill it before it kills us KKona
[4:52:44] OafALoaf: If I saw an incomprehensible horror, I would ignore it as I dont know what it is
[4:52:48] Hobo1001: its ok lawlman she had a Taylor Swift Sweatshirt on
[4:52:51] Gagey_wagey: I get that take honestly
[4:52:52] Hobo1001: LuL
[4:52:56] inuakurei: same tbh
[4:52:56] Oglino: no I get that take
[4:53:01] Oglino: I like feeling small
[4:53:04] Dozyderp: i find the vastness of reality comforting.
[4:53:09] LemiCheck: also we imagine these super advanced aliens, when really we're more likely to find bacterias and microorganisms
[4:53:10] BlukSmenbard: @stiilec [insert your mom joke here]
[4:53:16] Chardanak: NODDERS I respond to the dread horrors of the universe with apathy
[4:53:19] Ace_335: just a lil guy
[4:53:19] stiilec: @stiilec D:
[4:53:20] TinyLeviathyn: you big
[4:53:22] Shmartee: Exactly! If your impact is so negligible, you're free to live however you want
[4:53:23] Oglino: I like knowing nothing I do really matters
[4:53:27] Oglino: and I can just relax
[4:53:30] waroson: yo that is me
[4:53:37] Dozyderp: @Chardanak can't go mad from the revelation if you don't care about the revelation
[4:53:38] Digdudewhat: hell yea earth baby hearth of the imperium

[4:54:15] DoubleGambit13: Pretty sure that guy heard him get called sinner and wasn't happy
[4:54:15] OafALoaf: Here's a fun fact lawlboss: If you took every human on earth and lined them upa round the equator, most of them would drown
[4:54:16] ExNoctis: @LemiCheck yeah in general, my theory in regards to intelligent aliens is that if they exist they're probably in another galaxy and are about as aware of us as we are of them
[4:54:20] waroson: it really be
[4:54:22] cavetroll911: How are the planets suspended Hmmm

[4:56:11] Devious_gastropod: @KaiGoesMoo if you want more brain wrinkles, technically everything with mass bends space and time, It's just that black holes are the only thing that do it to the point we can observe it. Gravity is weak af
[4:56:13] Colgaldy: @TinyLeviathyn It was I can't party
[4:56:21] Colgaldy: I think
[4:56:39] Ace_335: I Can’t Party by Vulfmon
[4:56:48] Dozyderp: Its so funny how ''the universe is pointless and nothing we do matters'' is such a stock villain motivation, but all of us here are just stoked nothing we fuck up matters LUL
[4:57:04] Oglino: Dozyderp fr OMEGALUL
[4:57:08] Devious_gastropod: dude, I think the whole nothing we do matters take is dumb af
[4:57:10] TinyLeviathyn: y’all are fuckin amazing no1LOVE
[4:57:24] Devious_gastropod: I think the fact that there is no deeper meaning, means what we do has all the more meaning

[4:57:45] Colgaldy: But chat, in terms of time life has existed on Earth for 30% of the lifespan of the universe, and is therefore still very significant Nerdge
[4:57:45] waroson: it matters to me  Sadge
[4:57:53] ChibiYordle: I'm too busy thinking if I want to eat something or not on an daily basis to think about the universe
[4:57:57] Kaiyuro: Yeah nothing matters on the scale of the universe but our scale is earth dumbfucks
[4:58:07] TinyLeviathyn: @devious_gastropod do you believe in passing on a lesson or experiences to your offspring? like nature or instincts
[4:58:10] Mira__H: Yeah I think that would convince them
[4:58:19] Dozyderp: @Lawlman remember folks, all the complex matter in the universe was cast forth from the hearts of dying stars. we are all one as stardust :) now play Asol

[4:59:27] waffle__duke: Given enough time, hydrogen will start to wonder where it came from.
[4:59:31] ChibiYordle: I think that is the plot of the last antman movie
[4:59:35] stiilec: obviously
[4:59:36] Harry_DuBois_: Sure man
[4:59:38] OafALoaf: God forgot us in the car

[4:59:59] KaiGoesMoo: peepoArrive Hey I'm God, I'm back.... OH GOD WTF HAPPENED HERE
[4:59:59] Azathor97: The worst question to ask is, what's the purpose? Why is there anything in an endless void? Not "what am i compared to all this?", rather "why is all this?".
[4:59:59] SnailintheShell: He left for milk a couple thousand years ago and just never came back.
[5:00:00] Oglino: OMEGALUL HAHAH
[5:00:04] Percussion1: smurfed on god, get smited
[5:00:05] Dozyderp: the matter that makes up our forms was borrowed from those that came before. the iron in your blood was once ore in the earth, the water you drink has been drank by millions of lifeforms
[5:00:08] Guhnat: what lane does God play?
[5:00:14] Morphogum: God casually owns a villa on a resort planet sipping juice while tanning
[5:00:14] sack02: god is an aram main

[5:01:25] ChibiYordle: god is an yuumi main because he wants you to do all the work but him to get all the credit for it
[5:01:26] FleedleDeedle0: God gets tilted and causes a disaster to happen

[5:06:42] Greywyn00: oh hey its invoker
[5:06:47] BlukSmenbard: PTSD
[5:06:53] Colgaldy: This Hwei isn't abusing his wave clear tink
[5:06:53] Percussion1: can you ask august how many galaxies he thinks there are in the universe
[5:06:55] GebisGaming: @M3raN0M1 oh absolutely
[5:07:07] ChibiYordle: Percussion on some deep journey right now
[5:07:50] BlukSmenbard: how many lemons do you think there are in the universe?
[5:07:50] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq
[5:07:57] Hobo1001: ask August if he can tell you what is bigger a moon or a galaxy
[5:07:58] DraygoDraygon: @BlukSmenbard 2
[5:08:00] BlukSmenbard: and how many could you steal
[5:08:03] Hobo1001: tink
[5:08:07] M3raN0M1: man it’s so sad that the guy who designed smolder got laid off
[5:08:15] Colgaldy: It's 50% right so extra 7.5 dmg
[5:08:27] M3raN0M1: champ didn’t even reach the live servers before he was basically judged for the work he did
[5:08:40] ChibiYordle: Riot layed off too much of the LEC crew that they can't do their cool in studio hosting anymore
[5:09:02] ChibiYordle: for coviewing
[5:09:18] DraygoDraygon: Riot makes more money than ever and lays off like 11% of their staff, and the CEO posted like a "Sowwy I'm a smol bean" letter
[5:09:41] stiilec: classic riot L
[5:09:47] LemiCheck: I swear many layoffs were just based off of vibes
[5:09:58] ChibiYordle: I'm just sad the entire studio riot forge got layed off
[5:09:59] M3raN0M1: Sad that the games industry “meta” right now is to hire a shit ton of people throughout the year then have huge layoffs every january
[5:10:05] ChibiYordle: the riot forge games are fun stripSad
[5:10:10] GebisGaming: is tryndamere still the ceo tink
[5:10:25] stiilec: their indie games failed because they were way too expensive and barely marketed
[5:10:25] DraygoDraygon: M3raN0M1 Surely this won't have repercussions in the future to the industry Clueless
[5:10:46] GebisGaming: no is the answer to my question
[5:10:48] M3raN0M1: Yeah I mean have you ever seen the steam metrics for the riot forge games
[5:10:49] ChibiYordle: at least i am getting my stardew valley bandle city game stripCozy
[5:10:54] M3raN0M1: they basically had 0 players
[5:11:01] M3raN0M1: and 0 recurrent players
[5:11:04] Oglino: the riot forge games did not do great yeh
[5:11:11] Oglino: I cant blame them for that
[5:11:15] stiilec: @M3raN0M1 the sylas game was 40$ and marketing was nonexistent, dang no wonder it failed financially
[5:11:23] Harry_DuBois_: @DraygoDraygon Sure titles like total war won't suffer from lack of knowledge base in their own systems after that brain drain
[5:11:23] stiilec: it was a decent game though
[5:11:27] Colgaldy: Yeaj
[5:11:30] Dozyderp: sylas game was good, but not worth 40 bucks
[5:11:37] DraygoDraygon: @john_hw Absolutely not
[5:11:40] stiilec: yeah it was a 20$ game
[5:11:40] Hobo1001: same for any riot people Sadge
[5:11:44] Ace_335: I've been trying to learn vlad but I just can't get him to work peepoSad
[5:11:48] theHerominion: like it would change something
[5:11:53] M3raN0M1: the sylas game was a 15-20$ with 40$ game branding LUL
[5:12:01] BlukSmenbard: must be tough being GOD
[5:12:02] DunzoLuvsTurtles: Pls fix game tq :)
[5:12:04] NameThatIsAMeme: The new NUNU game was apparently good
[5:12:07] Dozyderp: ruined king slapped
[5:12:09] ChibiYordle: I played against an Rioter some time ago in aram. Though all we did was an complete onesided stomp CatCozy
[5:12:15] Hobo1001: what is bigger a moon or a galaxy :)
[5:12:18] Don_Savik: there are too many champs for everyone to be kept at a balanced winrate
[5:12:20] Grognog: Huh, really?
[5:12:25] KaiGoesMoo: peepoShy We're friends by proxy
[5:12:26] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: He chills in Sam's chat. or did when Briar cam e out
[5:12:28] BlukSmenbard: maybe this is why god doesnt speak to us, he realises we'd just bitch at him LUL
[5:12:28] sack02: i know he was in chat a lot when strippin was spamming brair
[5:12:29] ChibiYordle: August goes around to league streamers from time to time
[5:12:45] ChibiYordle: He probably found sam because sam was an big streamer and played briar stripNote
[5:12:56] BoneBudgie: jesus that yi read ur ass
[5:12:57] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[5:13:07] M3raN0M1: Ask him to ask Riot Phlox to give twitch qol pls, contaminate being a projectile and poofing half the time for no reason is smelly Madge
[5:13:23] Dozyderp: in the vast universe we live in, why do we have to live on the planet where master yi is a thing?
[5:15:00] stiilec: goodness
[5:15:14] M3raN0M1: Master Yi going from useless to hypercarry because he got a single kill from a single lane is my favourite mechanic tbh
[5:15:35] Oglino: danse
[5:15:52] Don_Savik: does Azir say Shurima more than Garen says Demacia?
[5:15:58] Oglino: probably
[5:16:19] Colgaldy: Nashor's spike big NOTED
[5:16:23] Dozyderp: for every demacia, there are at least 2 shurimas
[5:16:55] waroson: wha
[5:17:09] M3raN0M1: I think legally if Lawlman loses this game he has to go work for riot, I don’t make the rules NODDERS
[5:17:11] Dozyderp: i said what i said
[5:17:55] isyourTVrunning: Riot has that tencent money
[5:17:56] pandalisk9: im sure riot has some openings now
[5:18:07] Colgaldy: He gets to make big minion pogg
[5:18:07] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[5:18:11] isyourTVrunning: they treat their employees pretty well from what I understand
[5:18:18] mirofopp: mirofopp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! good stuff
[5:18:27] ChibiYordle: riot has top notch job security NODDERS
[5:18:31] Lolzor8: lol are we ignoring the massive layoffs
[5:18:34] DraygoDraygon: ^
[5:18:43] BoneBudgie: ^
[5:18:46] stiilec: what layoffs :) i heard theyre a great company to work for
[5:18:50] waroson: they would NEVER do that
[5:18:50] aldore_fallbearer: @Lolzor8 I think they were joking
[5:18:59] Morphogum: well even if they did layoff at least the severance package was really good
[5:19:14] Oglino: true
[5:19:21] M3raN0M1: Riot has like on call therapists and counselling  stuff that you’ll need when you watch all your friends get fired around you NODDERS
[5:19:31] ChibiYordle: and they would clearly give their employees an normal 2 week warning and not write some quirky forum message then fire them overnight
[5:19:37] Oglino: M3raN0M1 OMEGALUL
[5:19:43] DunzoLuvsTurtles: The severance package is an exclusive skin
[5:19:47] BoneBudgie: that was almost so clean
[5:20:35] owjesn1: lawman asir
[5:20:42] stiilec: why waste time and effort to make league based indie games, when you can make 1 lux skin?
[5:20:52] stiilec: for more money
[5:21:13] Oglino: danse
[5:21:41] ChibiYordle: why waste resources on making 1 lux skin when the real whales are there for jhin skins as the test 200$ jhin skin feedback/statistics was "it works" so they are continuing with those kinda skins
[5:22:00] itswooglets: Happy Shurima Saturday!
[5:22:10] Dozyderp: it wasnt even a skin, it was a chroma
[5:22:17] Oglino: most one tricks would pay out the fucking wazoo for a skin/chroma
[5:22:20] stiilec: @ChibiYordle 200$ skin? im out of the loop
[5:22:21] ChibiYordle: and it worked EZ
[5:22:23] BlueOokashi: Dance danse Dance
[5:22:24] pandalisk9: im just sad they are taking away the amazon prime capsules
[5:22:35] pandalisk9: it was my only source of skins and rp stripLUL
[5:22:48] hybridsnake: same panda Sadge
[5:22:56] M3raN0M1: I would pay £1000 for a Gangster Twitch chroma unironically
[5:23:04] Oglino: M3raN0M1 see thats what I mean

[6:00:14] Hellifyoudont66: Emerald is huge right now.

[6:08:15] TyrannessBelial: @Lawlman Hottest Person you ever seen, ask for your number, they're a Gangplank one trick, yes or no?
[6:08:15] Oglino: he'll always be good
[6:08:17] Colgaldy: Having a "main" in a moba never made sense to me. The whole point is to have a pool of characters for different comps/situations.
[6:08:18] PatbTV: Dota has that for each champ when you hover over them
[6:08:30] Hellifyoudont66: Hover champ, click Recent Changes, Get Bullet Points. Done. Fixed the game forever.

[6:09:12] ture69er: how about one trick lux?
[6:09:14] Khalleb: prob diana
[6:09:28] Colgaldy: Lux and Teemo one tricks are subhuman
[6:09:28] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq
[6:09:33] Colgaldy: You can't change my mind
[6:09:34] BoneBudgie: "I used to roll critplank back before the rework"
[6:09:55] Oglino: personally as a one trick its the fastest way to climb and improve
[6:09:55] CompulsiveOne: TWO OF THEM?
[6:10:00] CompulsiveOne: THERES TWO NOW?
[6:10:01] Hellifyoudont66: Guess you're not doing it. stripLUL
[6:10:02] Oglino: really good for people who actually want to grind ranked

[6:10:35] HahaHazer: Except I understand Hwei
[6:10:42] BoneBudgie: this is twink erasure
[6:10:43] CompulsiveOne: @Oglino yeah but you also think an eagle would win
[6:10:45] Kaiyuro: I mean if you're new, once you hit whatever is considered high rank you need to develop a pool
[6:10:54] Oglino: CompulsiveOne OMEGALUL
[6:11:05] Oglino: fucking owned them
[6:11:11] Colgaldy: I don't think you actually build any game knowledge or skill doing that though
[6:11:14] Hellifyoudont66: Having a main is fine and good. Having a few mains is better. But you NEED to have backups in case somebody bans the only champ you've ever touched.
[6:11:20] Colgaldy: It's only because the league ban system is fucked
[6:11:34] Oglino: Colgaldy after champ mastery comes game knowledge.
[6:11:38] Don_Savik: I wish Renektoy was real. I'd buy one.
[6:11:49] Oglino: if you are constantly playing something new you will never understand the basics
[6:11:58] Colgaldy: Mechanics =/= champ mastery
[6:12:05] BoneBudgie: lego legends
[6:12:18] FilthySerf: he looks like a fortnite skin but in a good way
[6:12:25] Oglino: no they literally are
[6:12:32] sack02: every single time i've ever heard a high elo person asked how to climb low elo
[6:12:35] Oglino: knowing literally every matchup
[6:12:36] CompulsiveOne: when you dont have to think about your champ any more you can focus on the other aspects of the game
[6:12:36] inuakurei: Renek as a toy would just be Killer Croc
[6:12:37] sack02: they always say pick a one trick
[6:12:40] Oglino: knowing every interaction
[6:12:57] inuakurei: but in a good way
[6:12:58] TheMan630: gj dragging him into wave

[6:14:00] BlukSmenbard: peepoCheer
[6:14:17] Oglino: barbadosblackbelly its off meta, this guys just trolling xdd
[6:14:25] barbadosblackbelly: oh :)

[6:14:37] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[6:14:41] barbadosblackbelly: off meta is cool
[6:14:43] CompulsiveOne: but that would be crazy too

[6:15:57] Hellifyoudont66: Didn't know we were playing DotA in 2007.
[6:15:58] Jocostar: a renekton hurt them badly in the past lol
[6:16:03] BoneBudgie: HUHH
[6:16:03] OafALoaf: you can tell hwei players are crybabies because they're always QQing
[6:16:11] sack02: well hwei lost mid for that
[6:16:21] Jocostar: wubblies up o7
[6:16:39] Oglino: even the argument of losing there one trick champion is only relevant like 5% of their games
[6:16:51] Oglino: like it doesn't come up often enough
[6:17:16] Colgaldy: @Oglino That's because of the fucked ban system. In an actual competitive setting they lose their champ 100% of times
[6:17:18] Uncertain_Fool: the grubbies NOOO
[6:17:27] JoePatzilla: Member when there were only 5 bans ?
[6:17:31] Jocostar: grubbles revenge arc incoming
[6:17:40] Hellifyoudont66: But does climbing to Plat actually DO anything if you only know your champ?
[6:17:41] sack02: the only risk to one tricking is one tricking meta champs
[6:17:56] sack02: if you know you're champ is banned 45% of the time, gotta at least two trick
[6:18:02] Jocostar: wtf is going on top lol
[6:18:15] LemiCheck: top is a freeway
[6:18:17] GebisGaming: a fiesta
[6:18:28] Colgaldy: One tricking is only good if you do it multiple times. I.E one trick one champ into another
[6:18:29] GebisGaming: a clown fiesta if you would be inclined
[6:18:36] Jocostar: poor cait is all alone at bot lol
[6:18:49] CaptainKarite: Aware
[6:18:52] Oglino: Colgaldy I feel like thats what most people do, me included
[6:19:00] Hellifyoudont66: It's okay, somebody on their team is only level 4.
[6:19:02] Oglino: I one tricked yone into Ornn and am now a Gwen main

[6:19:06] Uncertain_Fool: they will comeback COPIUM
[6:19:23] sack02: 5/1 aphelios monkaS
[6:19:23] Colgaldy: @Oglino I don't think that is what most people consider "one-tricking"
[6:19:40] Oglino: I know what every champ does and I can play them all but my understanding of my one trick champions is incredibly deep
[6:19:40] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[6:19:41] Hellifyoudont66: One-tricking is never playing anything else.
[6:19:50] Hellifyoudont66: Not having a main champ.
[6:19:59] Oglino: Colgaldy yeh see true one tricks are fucking useless, but no one does that
[6:20:02] Garrett_Redden: New top after the changes is really cozy
