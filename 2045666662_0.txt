[0:11:03] StreamElements: @COCAINE_BREAK_ANDY There is not enough scientific evidence to directly link obesity with increased risks of Kratom-related fatalities However it's crucial to prioritize your overall health and consult a healthcare professional before consuming any substances
[0:11:04] cawsmonot: kratos: Children who are picky eaters are more likely to develop anxiety, depression, and ADHD in later years, a study revealed.
