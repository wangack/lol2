[9:12:40] 2facedz: This tf
[9:12:47] Amaresu_: good thing rengar and botlane won
[9:12:50] lateencyy: TF is a Viper fan I think
[9:12:53] Amaresu_: this game uncarriable for riven evne if you re viper
[9:12:54] zakichi00: kill viper lose base

[9:14:00] Sleep_on_Nilou_thighs: @Amaresu_ scrub rush Hubris first, while i dont know much about rengar. I doubt that you know more about the champ than Scrubnoob
[9:14:09] Amaresu_: @T1Tesko i mean its poppy on enemy team and he cant oneshot anyone through poppy/xin, just getting carried. rav is good vs tanks so you can actually stay in lane

[9:14:58] ViperaDenis: @donbray1 you have the wrong one
[9:15:06] Amaresu_: @Sleep_on_Nilou_thighs hubris is good snowball item if you re trying to 1v9 but the champ rn is good cause his oneshot is untankable by anyone with profane cyclo opportunity. i play rengar myself. scrubnoob is goat rengar doesnt mean ppl who re best at their champs dont build shit items.
