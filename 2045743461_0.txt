[0:21:05] Anonymous0726: The lanes are different, not inherently easier or more difficult for the most part
[0:21:11] MapaMooncake: @lunola_spam they are different, but it is also dependent on what champions you're playing and the overall teamcomp that can make it harder or easier
[0:21:38] Anonymous0726: And yeah he's playing solo

[0:54:48] FrozenLavaReflector: Gwwn riven is a skill matchup thats slightly riven favored
[0:55:01] PoteetLee: Ok. Anyway. Congrats anon. Happy to find out you’re a brother @lil__soupy. And now I tip my hat and disappear for a little bit. Be back later.

[0:55:32] xthe_spacemanx: so since we are playing Gwen against  riven, is this a Riven cutting ceremony?
[0:55:41] vDaishar: Riven things
[0:55:42] PoteetLee: No, I was saying lil soupy is a brother.
[0:55:44] xthe_spacemanx: yo I’m ATO

[1:03:23] Anonymous0726: But that's what it looked like
[1:04:14] coolwaveofcalm: Is there any armor that you would build for this game?
[1:05:06] voidxit: Free baron for them
[1:05:48] TeaQLive: didn't u say u would come back on the alt acc??
[1:06:37] renziboss: since when losing baron means auto lose?
[1:06:46] coolwaveofcalm: Wow insta report
[1:06:58] Komar95_: paper mental
[1:07:16] voidxit: I don't get how u guys are losing this
[1:08:22] coolwaveofcalm: The Briar is giving up after 5up didn't rotate for Baron
[1:08:49] Atredeus: *after 5up got chased, took two south and killed one
[1:08:55] pureiinsanity: no its bad
[1:09:00] pureiinsanity: attackspeed slows dont work on jhin
[1:09:05] 2bnieroperator69z: mid being pushed prob
[1:09:06] Anonymous0726: They're not much of attack speed champs
[1:09:09] Anonymous0726: Idk

[1:09:45] pureiinsanity: ^
[1:09:54] pureiinsanity: Jhin doesn't even lose AD from the attackspeed slow
[1:09:56] pureiinsanity: it does nothing
[1:10:04] Anonymous0726: @pureiinsanity it reduces his ad slightly, bit it's not very effective
[1:10:14] Anonymous0726: Wait it doesn't?
[1:10:19] Anonymous0726: It's supposed to
[1:10:22] finediner: I've never really played that much league before but I think you should just kill the enemy and win.
[1:10:25] Anonymous0726: Or at least it used to
[1:10:29] pureiinsanity: @Anonymous0726 oh wither doesn't reduce his AD so thought would be the same
[1:10:56] Anonymous0726: Wither is weird, but I'm pretty sure frozen heart works
[1:11:24] pureiinsanity: thats funny

[1:17:32] Derperfier: 3 secs left for it
[1:17:35] Derperfier: iirc
[1:17:36] pureiinsanity: if 5up was reincarnated he would have piss luck stat
[1:17:48] Derperfier: @anonymous0726 he was in ulti mode

[1:18:05] vsmilotic: they deal a lot of dmg for sure those 3
[1:18:11] pureiinsanity: that ashe build omg
[1:18:18] FrozenLavaReflector: Your luck on thos champion sucks... but ypu had room to outplay there
[1:18:21] Kurogane22773: Maybe they don't know how to dodge hwei
[1:18:25] pureiinsanity: she thinks shes playing last season
[1:18:31] Anonymous0726: Or as I said fire ultimate at teammates first
[1:18:36] Derperfier: @anonymous0726 I mean he would’ve had to walk quite far tbf
[1:19:01] FrozenLavaReflector: You werw dead to 4th shot... you were not killing jhin in time
[1:19:03] Beemittens: blesss you
[1:19:06] FrozenLavaReflector: Bless you
[1:19:07] thegreenteamints: how is fiora this season?
[1:19:08] pureiinsanity: @5up btw if you need a broken URF pick On-hit Kennen is disgusting
[1:19:30] Anonymous0726: I think the ult shot that killed you was predictable and therefore dodgeable, but otherwise I think it was fine
[1:19:30] Derperfier: Yh u just have to one shot him but ur teammates inted so that the other enemies were also threats
[1:20:08] FrozenLavaReflector: No
[1:20:17] FrozenLavaReflector: Ypu always lose to kjin 4 shot there
[1:21:02] pureiinsanity: lmao
[1:21:05] taniquequeen: hi
[1:21:10] pureiinsanity: gwen has high winrate into olaf idk why
[1:21:25] Derperfier: not in that situation u win the best outplay potential is honestly leaving the fight but ur teammates inted anyway, if u tried to run him down u just get rooted
[1:21:35] FrozenLavaReflector: Yeah... post 6
[1:21:54] FrozenLavaReflector: Pre 6 is a try not to get hit by q time
[1:22:08] Derperfier: essentially just have to play off of w timings against any adcs especially vs ones with cc
[1:22:13] FrozenLavaReflector: We pray for jax jungle
[1:22:35] Derperfier: ripppp
[1:22:36] FrozenLavaReflector: Fuck
[1:22:52] FrozenLavaReflector: This in my opinion os gwens worst matchup
[1:22:54] FrozenLavaReflector: Yes
[1:22:56] Derperfier: essentially Yh
[1:23:02] FrozenLavaReflector: His e invalidates most of your kit
[1:23:17] Derperfier: if get lvl 2 prio u can delay suffering if he’s a bad Jax player
[1:23:48] FrozenLavaReflector: Ypu e his e and pray
[1:24:05] Derperfier: ^^
[1:24:22] Derperfier: when he has jump and counter strike u can never let him get into melee e range
[1:24:35] Derperfier: and u have to backwards q e as soon as he jumps onto you with e
[1:24:57] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[1:26:01] Derperfier: Yh ur lucky ig, it’s like with singed vs Gwen, singed is by far one of the worst but if the singed proxies it’s free
[1:26:44] Derperfier: I’m surprised he doesn’t know it considering it’s a pretty common matchup I’d like to think
[1:28:55] Derperfier: oh yh this matchup is considerably easier in s14 than s13 since they removed divine sundered (fuck that item)
[1:30:11] Derperfier: after u get riftmaker btw don’t go NA shore (unless the guy is legit not fighting you) since auto attacks r useless vs Jax obviously
[1:30:16] Derperfier: nashors*
[1:31:17] purplepanda032_: hey everyone1
[1:31:26] purplepanda032_: sorry i havent been here in a while
[1:32:37] Derperfier: well the play moreso is to burst him down with ur abilities moreso, and u can get more damage off of a shadowflame or liandries second (was prolly storm surge) since Jax just deletes in extended all ins after abilities are used
[1:33:21] FrozenLavaReflector: yeah more damage... but  gwen plays more for survivability as she has insane dps
[1:34:17] Derperfier: Yh shadowflame is like really good with true damage (I think extra damage for hp below 35%) this season
[1:34:44] forgotmyemailagain: You would have given up multiple waves and if it failed you'd be f'd
[1:35:13] cameron416: shadowflame that early just feels bad bc no hp
[1:35:13] Derperfier: u already have the backwards q e down tbf
[1:35:42] Derperfier: @cameron416 shadowflame 2nd over nashors ?
[1:35:52] Derperfier: I’m still saying rift first dw

[1:37:20] aiphxl: hello
[1:37:59] Derperfier: at like 3 items the Jax matchup is playable
[1:38:16] Derperfier: u just have a skill matchup on dodging e and then u one shot him
[1:38:45] forgotmyemailagain: prob not tbh
[1:39:00] cameron416: naut such a troll omg
[1:39:16] Anonymous0726: I think you don't because naut is fucking stupid

[1:41:28] cameron416: but bel fights that lmao
[1:42:22] Derperfier: tbf if ur fighting other ppl rather than matching Jax nashors is just better ig
[1:42:53] Derperfier: oh that’s disgusting zhonyas on Jax as well lovely champ
[1:43:00] forgotmyemailagain: gg
[1:43:40] FrozenLavaReflector: anutilius is like one of the most likely champs to die 12 times, what are you talking about
[1:43:52] cameron416: how do u die 12x and only have 7 assists to show for it more like
[1:43:58] FrozenLavaReflector: whenever you are losing, you just die whenever you go in
[1:44:05] Anonymous0726: ^what cam said
[1:44:07] FrozenLavaReflector: Cam is correct
[1:44:41] forgotmyemailagain: I dunno, from what Ive been watching everyone other than the varus kinda running it/getting gapped this game. Blaming everyone else doesnt help improve
[1:45:05] Anonymous0726: Varus isn't great but isn't the main problem
[1:45:19] Atredeus: "pointless to type to a player like that" says the player spamming the chat the most

[1:45:30] vsmilotic: u sure about master today? LUL
[1:46:11] vsmilotic: fed fed jax
[1:46:33] FrozenLavaReflector: 6 of 46 deaths
[1:46:40] FrozenLavaReflector: so sad
[1:46:43] Derperfier: Olaf has just single handed won the game
[1:47:05] Derperfier: with naut and belveth running into him
[1:47:22] pureiinsanity: your poor mmr
[1:47:29] 9fierce9: That has to be a firstiming bel or naut
[1:47:41] hoshiNstar: Would changing to Diana be better?
[1:47:42] vsmilotic: trundletop maybe SMOrc
[1:47:56] FrozenLavaReflector: you can try gwen jungle?
[1:48:03] FrozenLavaReflector: she works as a farming jungler
[1:48:04] pureiinsanity: someone donate him to stop playing Gwen xd
[1:48:16] hoshiNstar: I donated
[1:48:31] cameron416: lmao they said pemdas
[1:48:54] vsmilotic: its not even your fault LUL
[1:49:02] FrozenLavaReflector: i personally ban jax cause at least fiora w cant stun you as you have no hard cc
[1:49:30] 9fierce9: All these losses are not even close to your fault
[1:49:30] Derperfier: Gwen into Warwick sucks but it’s not as bad
[1:49:33] Derperfier: as Jax
[1:49:54] FrozenLavaReflector: yeah you are getting cursed with enemhy blind picking
[1:49:59] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[1:50:04] pureiinsanity: gwen into their team how lovely
[1:50:11] FrozenLavaReflector: but it is playable as long as you remeber that warwick prefers being at under 25%
[1:50:13] Derperfier: u just don’t fight unless you can one shot him 100 to 0 since ww passive will heal everything off the wave
[1:50:15] cameron416: tanks
[1:50:16] vsmilotic: if u dont try fight him early should be fine
[1:50:20] FrozenLavaReflector: tanks, juggernauts, some divers
[1:50:26] FrozenLavaReflector: she beat camille
[1:50:26] Derperfier: Gwen beats ksante and most tanks
[1:50:50] maverickx29: Tragedy
[1:50:50] cameron416: om
[1:50:52] Derperfier: Yh beats Camille because of waveclear for lvl prio tbf
[1:51:14] FrozenLavaReflector: or flash
[1:51:21] vsmilotic: gwen beat tank mostly she doesnt do well against most brusier
[1:51:21] FrozenLavaReflector: this is some wicked tech
[1:51:28] FrozenLavaReflector: arguably yes
[1:51:49] pureiinsanity: i think you do
[1:51:57] Derperfier: u could but this lane is honestly mostly dependent on whether the jgler comes
[1:51:57] FrozenLavaReflector: you just never finish oblivion orb till 4th or 5th item
[1:52:09] Derperfier: Yh ^^
[1:52:18] Airshredder: out of curiosity, what changes where made to Hwei?
[1:52:23] Derperfier: ur hapoy just farming otherwise (which sucks)
[1:52:58] cameron416: @Airshredder many over the past month. but his e cd was drastically reduced so that's one of the bigger oens
[1:53:04] FrozenLavaReflector: even trades are bad into waarwick
[1:53:12] FrozenLavaReflector: wait
[1:53:39] cameron416: keep lane pushed and pray ekko has a brain
[1:53:43] cameron416: into you that is
[1:53:55] Derperfier: ^^
[1:54:47] cameron416: anyone peep waht sums ww took
[1:54:56] Derperfier: when u get more confident on Gwen “bad lane matchups” are completely fine as long as u think u can carry from 2-3 items and beyond
[1:55:08] Derperfier: @cameron416 ghost tp
[1:55:36] Anonymous0726: Sort of works out ig
[1:55:54] FrozenLavaReflector: the way I'd describe gwen for your playstyles is an anti tank kayle  with earlier  powerspike and better splitpush potential
[1:56:00] Derperfier: some exceptions obviously (trundle rumble trynd udyr) but those champs are shit for all champs tbh
[1:56:03] FrozenLavaReflector: red buff
[1:56:18] FrozenLavaReflector: tower ranges are bs
[1:56:44] Derperfier: Yh tower ranges on the new map are harder to immediately eyeball as well
[1:57:14] Derperfier: is ekko blind or something
[1:57:15] cameron416: why did he use w on the grub
[1:57:34] Derperfier: and he blames mid ?
[1:57:39] FrozenLavaReflector: honestly you are winning lane even after that
[1:57:43] vsmilotic: in loser que too LUL
[1:57:54] mayleask: sure bro always the team never the player KEKW
[1:58:00] 2bnieroperator69z: can we please call out the ekko to be more aggressive
[1:58:54] Derperfier: Yh probably after riftmaker and w/e boots go for oblivion orb rush
[1:59:04] cameron416: red buff baby
[1:59:22] Derperfier: Yh ww is just bs XD
[1:59:23] cameron416: why not start tabis and get orb after rift
[1:59:28] Derperfier: lucky he doesn’t have barrier
[1:59:59] FrozenLavaReflector: actually warwick post 1 item does more magic damage
[2:00:05] solpiperita: peepoArrive
[2:00:10] Anonymous0726: Nice

[2:00:30] solpiperita: peepoWow

[2:16:39] xthe_spacemanx: how does chat get to choose? just first one to name a champ? or voting?
[2:16:42] cameron416: aka yuumi/graves day
[2:16:43] Derperfier: like she’s not meant to do well vs the matchups you’ve been playing tbf

[2:20:41] pureiinsanity: its 5up's own choice to follow my demon tech
[2:20:56] xthe_spacemanx: you voluntarily choosing her?
[2:21:07] Derperfier: ok here is a game where Gwen could be locked into malphite to hard win if there were ad champs in the team XD
[2:21:37] Derperfier: as soon as u leave top u get a free Gwen game unlucky
[2:21:52] xthe_spacemanx: so when/if we get the chat voted champs. do they have to be in meta? or can we get goofy with it?
[2:22:28] pureiinsanity: i could see it Dring gives 0.72% max health dmg which is not that much
[2:22:52] infer_n0: gotta go with Brand jungle then GoatEmotey
[2:22:54] Derperfier: I did see a 4:20 leash less Yumi jgl clear

[2:24:16] xthe_spacemanx: i just looked it up. Yuumi jg has a 8.23% wr in s14
[2:24:20] xthe_spacemanx: so it's viable
[2:24:23] pureiinsanity: omg 5up hates brand jungles

[6:12:14] cameron416: lb splits no? so maybe mercs bc you'll be seeing swain a lot?
[6:12:59] piekilluxxfuzzy: as a noob, whats the theory behind AD leblanc
