[2:23:07] xShinsen: xdd
[2:23:07] Nightbot: I‚Äôd say Zwag is better as an example. I‚Äôve watched a few of Pekin‚Äôs vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn‚Äôt matter so much because I‚Äôd say most players aren‚Äôt good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting

[3:35:52] CerditoPoderoso: Puedes jugar con vex?
[3:35:55] noctroewich: Doesn't change dps haha
[3:35:59] cadejos: while hitting tower move in range of nexus
[3:35:59] junohowwedoit: less travel time on autos doesnt change ur attack speed
[3:36:00] Claroves: seperate?

[3:36:03] trunnpet: DOESNT MATTER NOTHING MATTERS
[3:36:04] floaties10: its not even faster
[3:36:06] brandoom1312: getting next to it improves accuracy since the bullet drop update.
[3:36:10] paperrflowerr: the attack speed is the same still no?
[3:36:10] Claroves: hit the nexus from top and below? @PekinWoof
[3:36:17] dave39194: move next to the sacred heart of christ
[3:36:24] Megamixr: No shot, sylas is gentle with twinks
[3:36:25] pholtos: climb on top of the nexus to assert dominance

[3:36:47] xReptarSC: @PekinWoof do you think midbeast could be a Calvin Klein model?
[3:36:47] CHOHSAN: The move next to it was probably referring to projectile travel time for ranged autos.

[3:43:15] Armedanddangeruz: with netflix being there its totally possible
[3:43:16] paperrflowerr: its not riot who does arcane
[3:43:17] breadloafen: at the very least the art will be good
[3:43:18] breadloafen: no
[3:43:18] junohowwedoit: likely, animated series aren't immune to the season 2 curse
[3:43:20] luxanna_2k: no
[3:43:21] Flint_McButts: corporate is involved instead of fighting it. it wouldn't be surprising.
[3:43:21] BlueSNS: oh ya
[3:43:21] paperrflowerr: its outsourced studio

[3:43:41] AntonyTLK1: @breadloafen it sucked so much they rewrite the lore and now want it to be the canon disrupting the whole lore pre stablished
[3:43:44] Zirock_: @paperrflowerr just the animation is outsourced
[3:43:44] floaties10: his autos do  1  billion damage

[3:44:00] Retrovontulet: hello pekin can you dedicate this game to my mother?
[3:44:01] cak3enjoyer: Why is this skin so ugly

[3:44:03] cak3enjoyer: my eyes
[3:44:04] dave39194: the expectation ruins everything
[3:44:04] trunnpet: @towbean ok sick i second ur comment then, i also should've put nb as an option MB
