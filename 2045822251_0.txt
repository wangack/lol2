[0:03:10] misMATTch: lmfao that's actually so fair
[0:03:14] mirrortat: the bot dive got slightly scary for a second
[0:03:24] aredloss: Yo tes mon boy du Triolet
[0:03:32] DisclaimR: What does it do to your mental when a pause like that happens? It's very frustrating as a fan to see it so much lol
[0:03:47] MoonflowerCrown: is anyone going to contest jojo or is it just free?
[0:03:58] MoonflowerCrown: he dominated every lane so far
[0:04:12] mirrortat: maybe it's just for c9 voice comm content
[0:04:24] mirrortat: that was such a weird moment to pause for sure
[0:04:26] DisclaimR: Especially mid teamfight
[0:04:36] Useless_BM: best part of the night
[0:04:40] Loxi9: it turns out lcs is the stall and all 5 c9 members are pissing on it
[0:04:49] Loxi9: jojo is so wise
[0:04:56] aredloss: Fait longtemps jai vue Seb
[0:05:12] DisclaimR: turns out they just got shit on Kappa

[0:06:36] ayalabrennan515: surprisingly
[0:06:40] littleindianman12: Hey vulcan congrats on the victory. But the real question is how did you scrims ago against the true best team in the lcs tsm
[0:06:54] Useless_BM: i was also surprised by dig they could be fighting for top 4
[0:07:09] littleindianman12: Not again
[0:07:11] m_esse: can we fast forward to C9 vs FLY
[0:07:12] Useless_BM: TSM Aware

[0:07:41] ayalabrennan515: i thought dove did  ok against nrg
[0:07:44] littleindianman12: Curse bjergseon and dl
[0:08:19] m_esse: C9 Lucian when? we need to get the LCS a Lucian W
[0:08:23] littleindianman12: Is there a reason why TL smashes scrims, but chokes on stage? Is it the comps
[0:08:32] ayalabrennan515: are you looking forward to the flyquest matchup
[0:08:41] beachboy95: thoughts on if brand will be picked in NA?
[0:08:50] Useless_BM: LEC got their first W in one of the most disgusting games ive seen

[0:10:04] ayalabrennan515: how do you think inspired has been performing after coming back
[0:10:19] blue_crayon48: What is the difference between this c9 team and the flyquest team ?
[0:10:19] ayalabrennan515: 7min
[0:10:30] DisclaimR: 22 aka mid teamfight KEKW
[0:10:30] RaqoTaco: C9 team has other players
[0:10:34] RaqoTaco: and different team name
[0:10:36] RaqoTaco: I think thats mostly it
[0:10:46] Jedski: i enjoyed watching you guys play league in between my pause broadcast Kappa
[0:10:49] GuillaumePelletier: The first teamfight where its not going well for Fly, there going to be a pause KEKW
[0:11:17] blue_crayon48: @RaqoTaco But the flyquest team was also considered stacked. Just wanted to hear his thoughts
[0:11:20] ayalabrennan515: who do we play tomorrow chat
[0:11:27] RaqoTaco: I was just trolling bro dw
[0:11:28] RaqoTaco: HAHA
[0:11:32] beachboy95: This ez does not seem to know the HWEI
[0:11:40] littleindianman12: @ayalabrennan515 the best team in scrim aka tsm
[0:11:40] DisclaimR: Every team seems like they get a free pause because you're too good Kappa
[0:11:56] littleindianman12: @ayalabrennan515 we actually play shopify tho
[0:11:56] ayalabrennan515: @ayalabrennan515 we are so doomed Aware

[0:13:49] GuillaumePelletier: Was Hwei played in pro play?
[0:15:00] guy_in_chat_says: good job today mr laflamme
[0:15:13] Jedski: what did you think about during the pause since youre not allowed to think about the game Kappa
[0:15:33] georgetown: that ori noct combo was nasty today
[0:16:27] GuillaumePelletier: For a moment, I though the jungle had no vision, and then my dumb brain realised it was an overlay
[0:18:11] Aura16: Players usually hug former teammates after the game. Has a player you didn't really know ever try to hug you? If not would you ever accept a hug from a player you don't really know?
[0:18:52] Aura16: LUL
[0:19:02] Jedski: would you hug someone from chat
[0:19:14] agreeableleg: has a player you dont know tried to kiss you post game?
[0:19:23] ragsforfred: Is the person from chat wearing deodorant
[0:20:39] TheMaesen: :(
[0:20:48] GuillaumePelletier: Not the dono? BibleThump

[0:21:15] JXFullard: Congrats on another W
[0:21:15] boxxyy23: Dont you make enough being an lcs c9 support
[0:22:37] m_esse: how refreshing is being on C9 this split after last summer
[0:22:37] Badseed31: How much can you bench?
[0:22:52] blue_crayon48: Does anyone know what Hwei ult does exactly
[0:22:58] boxxyy23: it kills
[0:23:24] GuillaumePelletier: it forces you to subscribe to his deviantart
[0:24:24] Jedski: HeyGuys berserker
[0:24:36] GuillaumePelletier: Berserker Kreygasm
[0:24:42] JXFullard: Berserker scouting to get ADC ideas lol
[0:25:18] mirrortat: there's a BERSERKER
[0:25:22] WesleyGLIVE: Is it feelsbadman to win against your old club?
[0:25:29] GuillaumePelletier: Did you teach Berserker some french words?
[0:25:43] m_esse: ask berserker what he thought of the 2v2 dive
[0:26:00] jvrvilela: "Your Hwei is insane!" Berserker said, as he slipped his feminine hand into Vulcan's pants and smirked. "Are you trying to first blood me?" protests Vulcan, as Berserker blushes, the boyish figure undressed before Vulcan. "Weak tempo play, Berserker." The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Vulcan needlessly large rod into Berserker's open item slot
[0:26:11] GriffinStation: Yooo my mom and sister dropped by the C9 booth today. I live in Japan so I couldn't come see the games in person :( woke up at 4:30 am to watch tho

[0:28:43] CamChill: take me back
[0:28:59] mirrortat: it's just that you guys know you're gonna dive and how it was gonna play out but watching it real time for fans is objectively a bit stressful hahahaha
[0:29:10] mirrortat: (not a bad dive ) VoHiYo
[0:30:29] JXFullard: no misstep today?

[0:37:18] borntopimp: they want you hard, they spent everything for you
[0:37:40] BalloonHorses: I gotta say Phil, when I saw yall lock in kalista today, i held out hope that you were gonna pick taric
[0:37:41] JXFullard: hey, don't hate on yummi XD

[0:41:25] kinjalka: Can you duo again in challenger, or is it solo only?
[0:41:25] m_esse: do you have a favorite support in competitive and if yes who

[0:43:49] smolClaire: teams keep using pauses but it wont work GIGACHAD
[0:44:09] jeremyheyy: ratirlGiggle
[0:44:12] m_esse: you gave an estimated record of 12-2 before the split started. do you still think that
[0:44:13] kinjalka: yeah thats fair, its still better than the hyper scaling ad matchup
[0:44:15] smolClaire: karma is kinda op anyways , the karma mid tech jesus
[0:44:36] ragsforfred: But that guys ultimate for sure hit fudge last week
[0:44:50] Aura16: I can't wait to watch you guys face FLY. Jensen and Inspired getting a little cocky.
[0:44:57] coolcat2228: they showed on broadcast today
[0:44:58] ayalabrennan515: karmas not a jojo champ though right
[0:45:00] lllusions: veigars first apperance on LCS BatChest

[0:45:28] Aura16: @kinjalka true LUL
[0:45:34] m_esse: if you can’t answer this don’t get mad at me for asking. What teammates pushes the team the most
[0:45:56] ragsforfred: Inspired is two time mvp from two regions lol i think being cocky comes with that
[0:45:56] matthew0zz: inspired hasnt been cocky at all lmao
[0:45:59] jeremyheyy: why do more ppl not pick draven. hes so op
[0:46:21] kinjalka: @matthew0zz did you hear his interview today?
[0:46:32] jeremyheyy: he hurts lol
[0:46:33] EntangledLemons: Draven from behind is pretty laughable and you cant reliably get ahead in pro
[0:46:34] ayalabrennan515: confidence =/= cocky
[0:46:34] smolClaire: i saw that veigar clip on LCS OMEGALUL 14/3 at 24min
[0:46:50] lllusions: yeah
[0:46:53] smolClaire: YEA
[0:46:54] matthew0zz: @kinjalka yeah he said he’s aiming for top 2 and last week pretty much said c9 better unless they have a bad day
[0:46:57] lllusions: preshow they did
[0:47:08] kinjalka: When asked how he was looking to improve this split his answer was: Make sure my teammates listen to me more
[0:47:14] kinjalka: thats what Im talking about as cocky lol
[0:47:35] cambamwamtam: just wanted to come on here and say thanks for being so handsome and good at League
[0:47:35] m_esse: @kinjalka I know right. his interview sounded a lot like “if my team listens to me we’ll win”
[0:47:44] kinjalka: ^^
[0:47:59] ragsforfred: How did you like playing with him on EG
[0:48:05] kinjalka: He's definitely talented and a smart guy, no doubt there. Just maybe hard to work with based on that answer haha
[0:48:22] iamnolan4: which lck team played hwei support
[0:48:30] smolClaire: @EntangledLemons i feel this way about lucian, only lck/lpl is winning with him because they actually do crazy stuff to get him ahead early
[0:48:31] mirrortat: kt
[0:48:35] lllusions: yea
[0:48:47] Fraibe: demain vous jouer contre qui ?

[0:49:15] Fraibe: gl pour le 4-0 PogChamp

[0:49:28] GuillaumePelletier: Oh non! C'est l'équipe qui me déçoit le plus en ce moment BibleThump
[0:49:34] matthew0zz: you have to be a Draven player to play Draven I feel ain’t like most other adcs
[0:49:48] sigmaballs2: is karma strong supp now?

[2:03:01] VeigarV2: obivously your brand will combo
[2:03:02] VeigarV2: off your cc
[2:03:13] owneurmen: Vulcan_LoL i don't want to sound mean but how karmine corps manage to have so many fanbase when there are always losing like losing in valorant losing in league
[2:03:16] baconvsworld: I think imt beats kc
[2:03:18] VeigarV2: its like you are playing veigar, you land cage and your alistar knocks them out
[2:03:18] EntangledLemons: is this about when targamas w on rell and people think it was early? cause he did tank the mao R
[2:03:20] baconvsworld: No?
[2:03:26] baconvsworld: Or shopify
[2:03:35] baconvsworld: XD
[2:03:46] Xapper__: @owneurmen they have win emea 4 times lol
[2:03:51] EntangledLemons: but they get pushed into the cage borders and stop there no?
[2:03:55] EntangledLemons: free stun
[2:04:03] vincentive_: Oh, what was the pause for from today?
[2:04:05] owneurmen: VeigarV2  who the veigar v1?
[2:04:11] EntangledLemons: oh Sadge moment yes
[2:04:17] nkbsteam: nkbsteam subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:04:17] mathieustpierre14: angolo canté
[2:04:18] VeigarV2: they wouldnt die anyways veigar is fkin useless gg
[2:04:23] owneurmen: @Xapper__ yeah but the roster with scream was the worst performance of all time
[2:04:29] baconvsworld: You guys should abuse poppy top she's pretty broken
[2:04:49] fuzzymuffins2: it came from nocturne ult tho
[2:04:50] fuzzymuffins2: xdd
[2:04:51] VeigarV2: did they try to open their eyes
[2:04:53] c9wafflesmuggler: how as been playing on live patch for pro play?
[2:05:01] Fubuki_U: they thought that if they paused long enough everyone would fall asleep and they might win
[2:05:01] nkbsteam: Don't worry, most just say "NK" and np i really enjoy your streams. I may not be always due to our time zones but i like being here :)
[2:05:02] DisclaimR: Broadcast didn't really pick up the ult either to be fair
[2:05:09] smolClaire: but if you press ori ult before the noct fully flies it they cant see it anyways LUL
[2:05:22] vincentive_: that 4 man ult was insane. There was practically no way to react to it
[2:05:25] DisclaimR: When I saw the ult hit I thought you guys had an invisible gnar the way it looked lol
[2:05:27] smolClaire: jojo so good doing that multiple times in a row Pog
[2:05:29] vincentive_: guaranteed one person gets hit by it
[2:05:30] fuzzymuffins2: noobs
[2:05:36] Xapper__: @owneurmen i mean u can support a team even if they are loosing they are really good at RL, tft guys are gifted and kameto is the biggest streamer in France
[2:05:50] lolmihir: i lied ur ashe is wonderful
[2:05:57] 1yarsis: zyra game :D
[2:05:59] LeighFarris: In LCK 2 guys got inside the rift herald at the same time and double hit a tower then it disappeared.
[2:06:10] fuzzymuffins2: bard time
[2:06:18] lolmihir: i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
[2:06:37] owneurmen: Vulcan_LoL i hears you are good at ping pong is it true ?
[2:06:41] lolmihir: this is worse than heartbreak
[2:07:19] RekaAdc: do u agree with caedrel take that poke varus is not that good teamwise?
[2:07:19] c9wafflesmuggler: I would only forgive him if he sends in a hand written apology letter honestly
[2:07:43] nkbsteam: @LeighFarris i know Azir had some Bug related to the Herald.. was with that champ?
[2:07:46] Ebgreen1031: nah that double herald rider game got chronobreaked
[2:07:48] zGrayson: after the first week of playing on live patch how did it feel
[2:07:49] Ebgreen1031: not intended
[2:08:00] TheAppleMerchant: So much ad into Rammus
[2:08:18] owneurmen: @Xapper__ i mean if people enjoys supporting the team its good for the owner but i don't think he is the biggest french streamer i don't even know him gotaga and squizy are the biggest and there are also owner of esport org gentlemate
[2:08:20] lolmihir: has to snowball + have a lot of CC to gurantee dmg imo
[2:08:32] TheRealMC3: man these teams keep trying to tactical pause against c9 but it wont work Kappa
[2:08:34] LeighFarris: @nkbsteam I think it was Trist and jungler
[2:08:38] dankempgaming: Hey Vulcan, how's it feel to be back with C9?
[2:08:53] VeigarV2: t1 alrdy copies us
[2:08:56] TheAppleMerchant: you picked senna into it too
[2:08:57] VeigarV2: so its fine
[2:09:14] RekaAdc: big facts
[2:09:31] TheRealMC3: glad to have you back at c9 vulcan
[2:09:37] owneurmen: everyone are talking about the french esport org karmine corps but what you think about the new esport project squiizy and gogata decided to start call gentlemate
[2:09:37] thiccontwitch: 3-0 vs 0-3 tmrw big game
[2:09:43] c9wafflesmuggler: black clever game? or is there a new team shred item?
[2:09:56] vincentive_: Honestly, Shopify looked better than they did week one already
[2:09:57] Xapper__: @owneurmen the story of KC is just something else!
[2:09:58] Fubuki_U: tactical on him legendary jhin that stomped shopify MONKA
[2:09:59] Dalsonson: Thats Ssumday
[2:09:59] ImACopepod: Yone is ssumday
[2:10:02] NonAagro: Ssumday
[2:10:06] TheRealMC3: WAYTOODANK
[2:10:06] nkbsteam: Must be his WIFI password..
[2:10:10] zGrayson: i just redeemed yones name and got pax tf
[2:10:16] ChuckBeardo: it's his starcraft CD key
[2:10:25] VeigarV2: check disc when you can you will laugh
[2:10:26] Kleptic_Heist: cd key
[2:10:29] VeigarV2: good comms XD
[2:10:51] nkbsteam: If you search Yone's name your computer start talking in chinese OMEGALUL
[2:10:52] VeigarV2: its not our comms
[2:10:55] Dalsonson: Doublelift made a League 2 joke, made me bust out laughing
[2:11:16] Zachary_Blobman: is KC comms?
[2:11:18] vincentive_: Honestly, out of all the teams, TL has been incredibly underwhelming
[2:11:28] VeigarV2: ima sleep gn gl soloq
[2:11:35] baconvsworld: Gn veigar
[2:11:35] vincentive_: gn @VeigarV2
[2:11:39] xMapax: gn veigar
[2:11:42] nkbsteam: gn Veigar
[2:11:46] TheRealMC3: gn veigar
[2:11:47] baconvsworld: Good coach
[2:12:06] knightwares: rammus op or what
[2:12:09] brighthanabi1: what are korean players doing on NA
[2:12:18] vincentive_: I wait for the day Blaber busts out the rammus
[2:12:34] owneurmen: @Xapper__ maybe this is why i don't understand the hype for the org because i did not follow the team at all and don't know kameto but i think if you give like 2-3 year gentlemate going to be the top france esport org and kc going to lose a lots of popularity
[2:12:55] aoif: do u enjoy moving?
[2:13:02] smolClaire: 4man bot 3min wtf
[2:13:46] niceokay: -3 :(
[2:13:53] NonAagro: bro ur autos are healing
[2:13:59] aoif: i meant cc xdd
[2:14:26] marcellui: is maokai s tier
[2:14:53] niceokay: fk
[2:14:55] coulombpersecond: rip
[2:14:58] blacksteve: They should make a dodge / clean / qss the cc mini game.
[2:15:13] EntangledLemons: but i m dodging the yasuo q reliably this way BabyRage
[2:15:22] nkbsteam: @marcellui Yup, S tier
[2:15:26] niceokay: XDD
[2:15:46] NonAagro: how's taric this patch
[2:16:08] EntangledLemons: why do people on this channel have such a hard on for taric OMEGALUL
[2:16:17] Xapper__: @owneurmen dont think so! most of the fanbase dont know anything about esports they are there bc of squeezie or gotaga and M8 is following KC road so it cant be the same
[2:18:00] SaumonSalty: 2.3k holy my man
[2:18:10] EntangledLemons: Gayge
[2:18:11] vincentive_: enemy team all in comms
[2:18:18] Shanierd513: @NonAagro Gayge
[2:18:28] vincentive_: they're going to replace TL next split
[2:18:31] Shanierd513: @EntangledLemons Gayge BillyApprove
[2:20:05] vincentive_: You need to make sure that Blaber tries out rammus next scrim block
[2:20:07] EntangledLemons: embrage the Gayge
[2:20:13] owneurmen: @Xapper__ Squeezie, Gotaga & Brawks are the founder and owner so is already more visibility and algorithme than only kameto and there have more budget to bring big player to the org
[2:20:49] Nightbot: Follow my Instagram so follower count goes high! https://www.instagram.com/vulcan.lol/
[2:20:54] RekaAdc: do u think yasuo adc is viable?
[2:21:58] owneurmen: @owneurmen also how you can say there don't know esport gotaga and brawks was the 2 most achieved french call of duty esport players back in the day

[2:37:37] Ab176: You guys played better but they were luckier gg
[2:38:21] 5fire: wait I thought it was a fake vulcan LMAO
[2:40:40] owneurmen: Vulcan_LoL what you think about wild rift
[2:41:16] diamond: the only thing that could fix vulcan's mental right now would be to check if you have a free twitch prime laying around that is not currently being used
[2:41:37] trespasur: king of springggggg

[2:54:30] Lodit24: not even close
[2:54:34] Prophet181: there is no way c9 wins MSI this year, riot will cancel MSI again after they see C9 have another dominant split

[2:58:38] owneurmen: i mean shopify are 0-4
[2:58:41] owneurmen: not cloud9
[2:58:45] owneurmen: if there lose

[3:06:44] wrektangles: KEKW
[3:06:44] renard422: Have you tried out a keyboard with the "rapid trigger" feature before? It lets you actuate your key presses slightly quicker. I think it gives a competitive edge especially in reaction time based situations
[3:06:46] Ab176: winning a game is a myth
[3:07:01] Damastalex: Allez Vulcan 3-0 toi et ton equipe sont les SMURFSSSSSSSS
[3:07:04] AdmiralQunniza: AÆqq af de

[3:09:12] luffy_senpa1: gotta end on a win
[3:09:16] scruffycheese: does c9 internet still go out at 12?
[3:09:32] nkbsteam: i have Faith in you, that's why GlitchCat
[3:09:47] Lodit24: @owneurmen 150 to 200€ seems pretty okay
[3:09:55] scruffycheese: just remeber when sneaky used to stream it went out at night
