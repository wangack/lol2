[5:26:58] LoLRankBot: Wingsofdeath is Emerald III 0 LP
[5:27:16] CaptainDeston: Old runes were way better. You could actually have decent set ups to help early game for any lane instead of the scaling weird mixed pre set stats there are now. You could also scale stuff a bit with them, but it all felt more flexible
[5:27:44] Cozichacozee: yeh but grinding those runes was a bitch
[5:27:58] CaptainDeston: It was ngl
[5:27:58] imaruki: ADC TF LUL

[6:02:11] Komlin111: you can have shock value without crossing that line.
[6:02:40] CaptainDeston: Yeah, that's fair. I do agree that in regards to goblin slayer it doesn't really get worked into being very plot relevant other than barely adjacent to the plot itself
[6:02:59] CaptainDeston: GoT definitely has the stuff in it contextually make sense and be plot relevant
