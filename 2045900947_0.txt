[1:16:08] From_Zero: Also use slow to get close, and only pop ult when your there and e runs out, so not the worst
[1:16:31] Fromorg: Seems like sunfire would be better. Damages all the time instead of just during ult
[1:16:32] renzoarg: aight 45s, not worth on udyr... but it's so cheap!!!

[7:20:42] saw141: @matoG4 Tencent is one of the largest companies in the world, regardless of being a Chinese company. But as a Chinese Company, and a major one, they are beholden to the Government. Microsoft (at least publicly) is not beholden to the US Government. The simple point is I trust Microsoft as a company more than Riot. And I trust other Anticheats on a case by case basis.
