[0:25:53] iamyourleader: ideal sup item usage means you never execute minions
[0:25:58] iamyourleader: and eat 6 when ur adc leaves/dies
[0:26:06] civinic: riot try not to over buff/nerf challenge
[0:26:26] OmegaMonsoon: as a leona main i will always try to execute minions to hit 2 faster
[0:27:08] iamyourleader: why execute
[0:27:13] iamyourleader: when you cna just kill the minion

[3:25:13] ash_chiming: ez actually scripting?
[3:25:14] DudeBroMaximus: To be fair you shouldn't force an idea just to get on Shark Tank. That will end poorly.
[3:25:22] DudeBroMaximus: I've seen some stinkers

[3:27:52] alanti30: @stunt I try Nasus support with max W + items Frozen Hearth and Rylai ( feels strong )
[3:28:20] ibeo01: Hey stunt!! Glad I can finally catch a stream.
[3:28:27] everyman322: @DudeBroMaximus yeah you should go on shark tank for publicity for something you're actually trying to pursue, not vice versa, not even to secure an investor except to say you have a celebrity investor to get other less costly investors
[3:28:59] twinkothy: report him anyway
[3:29:03] ibeo01: I also wanted to ask a question as a Kayle main, do you think any support items would be any good on her?
[3:29:08] PacificShadowX: Suske
[3:29:12] ThomasTheTwink: Susge

[3:29:53] kufuhu: the micro movement near fio was insane
[3:29:56] everyman322: just report and let riot sort em out. they're not going to ban em anyway just on 1 report
[3:30:13] everyman322: but they're for sure not going to ban if nobody ever reports them
[3:30:17] ThomasTheTwink: teaa
[3:30:56] shinyclodsire: that's so silly lol
[3:31:03] DudeBroMaximus: oh was that in OCE? yeah suuuper sus, like impossible to deny the wintrade attempt
[3:31:04] kufuhu: enemy was so bad that the wintrade had to be that obvious
[3:31:08] Balldropper: BIG
[3:31:12] DudeBroMaximus: he stops hitting an inhib for no reason
[3:31:16] ThomasTheTwink: wintrade Pog

[3:31:27] shinyclodsire: LOL
[3:31:36] DudeBroMaximus: wait this one is different
[3:31:39] DudeBroMaximus: I saw the Jayce wintrader
[3:31:53] jp555jp: of course he is betting lol they get paid little compared to bets he would win
[3:31:53] Tricking9: not even trying to hide tbh
[3:31:54] Balldropper: oops my bad
[3:31:54] ThomasTheTwink: he‚Äôs not even q
[3:31:57] kufuhu: he said "I'll share the $$$"

[3:32:30] ThomasTheTwink: canwin
[3:32:43] shinyclodsire: Chatting can win fOR SURE
[3:32:52] kufuhu: I mean sometimes hyli's LEC ints look like wintrades too
[3:32:58] everyman322: maybe his brother was playing on his account 4Head
[3:33:02] PacificShadowX: Looking
[3:33:02] cloudydaisies: stuntDetective
[3:33:48] everyman322: I bet as soon as the anticheat thing rolls out, scripting will go waaay down
[3:34:43] jp555jp: yeah he was chasing then stopped last second
[3:35:08] shinyclodsire: Erm
[3:35:09] everyman322: he's teleporting
[3:35:13] shinyclodsire: that one is a little sus
[3:35:16] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[3:35:23] shinyclodsire: and he dodges the w
[3:35:36] DudeBroMaximus: yeah that's scripting I'm sorry
[3:35:48] everyman322: I'm expecting the POV clip has the cheat overlay now LuL
[3:35:48] ShepGG: the plot thickens D:
[3:35:49] trunnpet: the lulu lol
[3:35:57] Cajayb: any s tier picks for this season?\
[3:36:02] stunt: !tierlist
[3:36:02] Nightbot: https://gyazo.com/e0e95c68106d5581ce0bc38b27770b81 (14.2)
[3:36:08] DudeBroMaximus: @Cajayb Maokai supp
[3:36:10] DudeBroMaximus: apparently
[3:36:11] DudeBroMaximus: 55%
[3:36:15] Cajayb: sheesh wtf
[3:36:47] pretzel_ikz: nahhhhhhh
[3:36:48] ShepGG: the scripts are evolving monkaEyes
[3:36:51] pretzel_ikz: the blind flay dodge
[3:37:07] everyman322: his mouse cursor is just teleporting around the screen
[3:37:11] shinyclodsire: well its not like he didnt know thresh was there
[3:37:14] shinyclodsire: yea totally
[3:37:19] pretzel_ikz: perfectly steps out of flay
[3:37:25] DudeBroMaximus: nah he went to run behind ally in case of hook
[3:37:28] cloudydaisies: mhm
[3:37:32] kufuhu: it depends if he dodged on animation or not, you can pre-dodge by anticipation
[3:37:41] ThomasTheTwink: I mean is pretty normal to be apprensive about the bushes
[3:37:42] shinyclodsire: i would definitely dodge down to viego for hook
[3:37:54] pretzel_ikz: i would dodge up tho
[3:38:18] DudeBroMaximus: Varus sus, this one seems fine
[3:38:19] shinyclodsire: yea this one looks fine to me. the varus one is so sus
[3:38:20] everyman322: either the framerate is too low or his mouse just instantly disappears from one spot and appears across the screen
[3:38:34] pretzel_ikz: walking behind viego too to dodge hook is too predictable
[3:38:36] Tricking9: teaa
[3:38:39] colaaaaaddict: all drama is pointless
[3:38:41] TrollAnnie_: speaking of drama did you see bebes tweet on the riot lay offs OMEGALUL
[3:38:41] pretzel_ikz: dodging up makes more sense
[3:38:43] ThomasTheTwink: Dram@
[3:38:45] vogue_hommes: teaa
[3:38:45] ShepGG: thank you mr stunt stuntNoted
[3:39:03] shinyclodsire: soraka mid WOO
[3:39:13] ThomasTheTwink: soraka mid ez win q
[3:39:20] shinyclodsire: the super long one?
[3:39:29] shinyclodsire: or was that before layoffs?
[3:39:58] everyman322: feels like there's a ton of scripters in arams, probably because nobody thinks anyone would script in aram and thus nobody would report them
[3:40:05] vioietlol: !onlyfans
[3:40:10] softlysupports: elisLookUp
[3:40:12] TrollAnnie_: look i don't think bebe is a bad guy but he really needs to think a little more before hitting send tweet
[3:40:13] PacificShadowX: @odirlol Suske
[3:40:14] shinyclodsire: lookup
[3:40:17] TrollAnnie_: @odirlol HUH

[3:40:52] TrollAnnie_: wholesome redemption CapyRose
[3:40:55] shinyclodsire: omg get sturdy on the m
[3:40:57] pretzel_ikz: getting sturdy is like eating veggies, no?
[3:41:01] ItsDagg: i still dont know what it means
[3:41:02] everyman322: üçÜ ?
[3:41:06] taibotxd: focus sash/sturdy
[3:41:10] shinyclodsire: getting sturdy is like a dance what
[3:41:15] Plahbie: geodude
[3:41:34] ItsDagg: i stopped playing after gen 2
[3:41:34] taibotxd: magnetite like the baby? not even evolved
[3:41:40] Plahbie: it was so annoying when you're farming xp because geodudes don't get oneshot
[3:41:43] Plahbie: because of sturdy
[3:41:50] TrollAnnie_: im playing pokemon violet for the first time and man its such a shame it runs so poor its not a bad game

[3:42:34] Cajayb: gen5 is peak cease ur slander
[3:42:39] everyman322: @springrollnoodle are there non-cute mf skins?
[3:42:40] pretzel_ikz: i remember the when i first started playing league i opened a pack with the mega rare MF skin and i freaked out
[3:42:42] ash_chiming: stunt you can‚Äôt do black and white like that
[3:42:45] TrollAnnie_: i liked x and y I thought that was pretty good
[3:42:48] lolbreezyyy: yeah the wombo
[3:42:58] springrollnoodle: @everyman322 thats a good point indeed
[3:43:02] Navcan: do queue times at this hour bother you at all?
[3:43:04] 5turdy: the older pokemon games r also more nostalgic
[3:43:09] softlysupports: waaait really ive read that the best pokemon games were like plat/diamond and black/white 2 projec576Peek
[3:43:36] Plahbie: I agree
[3:43:39] JhynRyder: Hey Stunt, can you tell me what the most important function as a suuport is?
[3:43:40] Cajayb: recently yeah
[3:43:41] Plahbie: that's why palworld is taking over
[3:43:48] JhynRyder: Cant climb furhter then platin
[3:43:53] softlysupports: arceus legends was the best switch era game bla
[3:43:59] softlysupports: pokemon game*
[3:44:04] TrollAnnie_: palworld is so different from the pokemon format tho
[3:44:11] ItsDagg: mobile ward
[3:44:20] Cajayb: stunt aware of companies wanting more money
[3:44:24] Cajayb: owo
[3:44:33] pretzel_ikz: WAIT every other guide says to CS better
[3:44:40] Femuline: what is a side lane
[3:44:51] softlysupports: sword and shield were amazing to me nyaMhm
[3:45:10] ProfessionalDilettante: Does it feel like you see the pros playing more soloq since the lcs live patch changes? If so, how is it affected the experience? good/bad/neutral?
[3:45:12] cloudydaisies: stuntOh
[3:45:21] taibotxd: why so many layoffs
[3:45:22] Femuline: google says 1900
[3:45:28] Belcoot31: it‚Äôs technically microsoft
[3:45:29] everyman322: if they decided to cancel the game, makes sense
[3:45:29] softlysupports: covid era hiring booms have bursted
[3:45:39] 1nsomniverse: m thinkin its related to ai
[3:45:40] Cajayb: just give me league rpg i will fund the whole thing
[3:46:09] taibotxd: I‚Äôm glad I work in a school and have a union soemtimes cause shit like this. crazy
[3:46:12] everyman322: like they were just waiting to an excuse to fire everyone?
[3:46:15] ledoz: iG Camille Pog?
[3:46:19] Belcoot31: theynspent 69 million to buy blizzard then they payed off 1900 staff from Xbox Bethesda and blizzard
[3:46:43] softlysupports: im so sad riot forge died i loved ruined king
[3:46:56] Cajayb: teemo
[3:47:00] shinyclodsire: ruined king was so fun
[3:47:02] Cajayb: nvm lol
[3:47:05] softlysupports: i wish riot had pushed the game more with like league streamers ono
[3:47:40] everyman322: @softlysupports seems like they just didnt promote it hardly at all. and it came out right around the time arcane did right?
[3:47:43] softlysupports: @shinyclodsire it was so special to me like to see the league world/lore eavLost
[3:47:46] wilfrLd: dreaemFight I'm just looking forward to ProjectL now
[3:47:53] softlysupports: @softlysupports umm i dont remember but they definitely didnt promote it much
[3:47:54] Juliaggpolka: its not bcs of a.i, the economy is not doing good and people are loosing purchasing power which in turns makes them consume less tech products
[3:48:09] Juliaggpolka: and as such, big companies like  microsoft have to let people go so it doesnt bleed into profits
[3:48:58] negraodaniel: good evening mr stunt
[3:49:15] shinyclodsire: yea ruined came out the month before arcane did
[3:49:21] shinyclodsire: ruined king* i mean
[3:49:24] ledoz: we fix YEP
[3:49:33] softlysupports: that's so tragic it should have been massive
[3:49:40] softlysupports: like with arcane or riot pushing it but oh well
[3:49:52] shinyclodsire: yea, its such a good game. and the aesthetic is really neat
[3:50:07] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[3:50:15] try_weii: get a bard meep
[3:50:15] shinyclodsire: both
[3:50:19] jesushooves2: cute
[3:50:19] ledoz: i wanna haev camille in my champ pool but i have no clue on how to play her haha and i feel people in lower elo will think i troll
[3:50:20] tymen90: deep meaning!!
[3:50:21] everyman322: @Juliaggpolka so they say, but if they planned better, the economy changes much faster than the development cycle of even the smallest software projects
[3:50:22] Plahbie: that's a good question
[3:50:25] pessimisticfroggy: cute!
[3:50:27] Endz_Nz: get STUNT across ur back
[3:50:32] Ali3va: deep meaning...stays  forever
[3:50:37] tymen90: yea tabula rasa is cool!
[3:50:37] shinyclodsire: i got a cute little ghost on a whim at a convention. just for fun
[3:50:42] Plahbie: that's so boring
[3:50:44] Plahbie: imo
[3:50:45] pessimisticfroggy: I feel like a cute tattoo as ur first tattoo is always fun
[3:50:50] springrollnoodle: it can be both cute and meaningful thooo
[3:50:56] try_weii: one of us should get a stunt portrait tattoo
[3:51:05] Plahbie: that's wonderful
[3:51:21] shinyclodsire: pookie butt owo
[3:51:26] negraodaniel: i wish riot do more tv show and movies, not necessarily like arcane, maybe in a more fun or adventures way
[3:51:32] springrollnoodle: YESSS
[3:52:00] everyman322: @Juliaggpolka I mean finding and hiring good people is pretty expensive so firing large numbers of them means the company screwed up bigtime. The economy isnt bad enough to significantly change software demands in the long term
[3:53:01] Juliaggpolka: @everyman322 It depends on labour vs costs, what a company and microsoft probably did is evaluate if these workers are needed but of course i cant speak for microsoft beside making assumptions as to why
[3:53:22] try_weii: how does the minion cut work now
[3:53:24] try_weii: i dont understand it
[3:53:30] DudeBroMaximus: minion cut is doing my head in bros
[3:54:05] shinyclodsire: Scared
[3:54:11] tymen90: niiice
[3:54:46] shinyclodsire: yea that was so long
[3:55:04] shinyclodsire: huhh
[3:55:10] PacificShadowX: HUH
[3:55:31] everyman322: @Juliaggpolka yeah but if they hired them they clearly determined they were needed at some point. even if microsoft's overall business is shrinking long term, any way you slice it it's due to poor management
[3:55:45] softlysupports: THEVOICES
[3:56:11] kufuhu: camille looks so fun
[3:56:23] taibotxd: lol
[3:56:28] ledoz: lmao
[3:56:29] taibotxd: not the parent vibes
[3:56:40] pessimisticfroggy: big and greedy

[3:58:11] bergsdal: @everyman322 its difficult to say unless you viw microsofts economics, perhaps optimistic management hoping for the economy do to wel made them do those decisions first

[4:02:26] denunciator: that flash
[4:02:42] jpressie: peepoArrive hi stunty
[4:02:44] everyman322: @bergsdal the economy is up pretty big over the last month, 6months, 1year, 5years... even consumer spending grew more than expected
[4:02:51] everyman322: last year*
[4:03:27] bladetrinity16: you say that as she misses q
[4:03:34] denunciator: the macroeconomy isn't necessarily indicative of sectoral performance
[4:03:49] shinyclodsire: you're so right OkaygeBusiness
[4:03:51] bladetrinity16: was a zoning q to keep them off the wave emiCopium

[4:05:29] bladetrinity16: phrasing
[4:05:30] ash_chiming: WHAT
[4:05:36] bergsdal: @everyman322 Yes but these metrics are not a good indicator when it comes to purchasing power and value. When you get less for the same dollar prev year, that means people will spend less on things like electronics
[4:05:37] ash_chiming: she can blow you huh?
[4:05:41] PacificShadowX: same Kreygasm

[4:07:03] whatgalaxies: feralHype
[4:07:03] everyman322: @bergsdal inflation adjusted spending power went up though... and software spending went up and is predicted to rise dramatically. and microsoft revenue has only gone down 1 year in the last 20
[4:07:04] bladetrinity16: cam q is balanced
[4:07:05] shinyclodsire: that dude just blew tf up
[4:07:10] Suzakus: OhISee
[4:07:14] Femuline: shen probably grateful for the carry :p

[4:07:49] RiftJockel: why u dont go trinity celestreal over bloodsong on camille?
[4:08:16] shinyclodsire: sundered sky bloodsong is more dmg, then you get titanic for survivability
[4:08:27] bergsdal: @everyman322 If that was the case then microsoft and other tech companies would not fire people :P
[4:08:39] shinyclodsire: pfft he really tried it
[4:09:09] everyman322: @bergsdal yeah unless management screwed up bigtime like I think is the case

[4:10:44] shinyclodsire: she ate your e
[4:10:55] shinyclodsire: unlucky
[4:11:41] bergsdal: @everyman322 Well yes I would agree if it was an isolated event where microsoft was the only company firing but Spotify fired 1.5K in december which means to me, this is not bcs of mismanagement entirely. But time will only tell
[4:12:13] spicebagextrahot: What should enchanters rush
[4:12:56] shinyclodsire: it depends which one, but usually staff of flowing water or like shurelyas/mandate
[4:13:07] everyman322: @bergsdal I would not assume poor management is not widespread, but yeah no way to know for sure
[4:13:11] jesushooves2: how come u always stun her and she isnt immune
[4:13:16] bladetrinity16: @shinyclodsire sometimes its also moonstone
[4:13:23] shinyclodsire: ^ yea

[4:20:24] everyman322: @jiglish just buy and use em when you need em and it wasnt too much
[4:20:59] Ellazys: they are red and blue based on red side and blue side
[4:20:59] ash_chiming: yeah usually your minions are always blue
[4:21:06] alesilt: prob talking about colorblind mode
[4:21:07] Ellazys: when i play, mine are always blue
[4:21:08] ash_chiming: but your allied minions are red
[4:21:09] Ellazys: @ash_chiming yeah this
[4:22:08] shinyclodsire: !runes
[4:22:10] LoLRankBot: Last Game (Karma): Arcane Comet > Nimbus Cloak > Celerity > Scorch | Biscuit Delivery > Cosmic Insight | Adaptive Force > Adaptive Force > Health
[4:22:14] shinyclodsire: nope
[4:22:29] jiglish: high elo players still dont get them lol
[4:22:37] fzrdz: It's not color blind mode, you are talking about relative team color setting
[4:22:43] Ellazys: @LoLRankBot when this says health, is it the 65 base health or the one that scales with level?
[4:23:01] Pyurrah: minions can either be team = blue, enemy = red, or red side = red and blue side = blue, and it's a setting that changes it
[4:23:11] Ellazys: @Pyurrah thank you
[4:23:22] Pyurrah: o7
[4:23:26] ash_chiming: what advantage is there to switch the color?
[4:23:31] ash_chiming: or is it just aesthetic
[4:23:46] Pyurrah: seems just like personal preference
[4:23:54] shinyclodsire: @Ellazys that one is just the base 65 hp. it would say hp scaling for the other one
[4:24:00] everyman322: @ash_chiming whatever is clearer to you
[4:24:08] claydlol: sell ur boots for ninja tabi

[4:26:16] PekinWoof: When making invididaual 401k contributions should I be putting into my Roth 401k or Traditional
[4:26:54] alesilt: HUHH
[4:27:06] shinyclodsire: you mean your roth ira?
[4:27:13] shinyclodsire: cause that one
[4:27:53] everyman322: @PekinWoof depends on if you anticipate having a lower or higher income post retirement. most people plan to have their house paid off so regular 401k max first.
[4:28:02] ash_chiming: teammates spitting
[4:28:23] PekinWoof: @PekinWoof isn't Roth also not tax deducatable

[4:30:01] ray_xray: going well*
[4:30:10] everyman322: @PekinWoof roth ira and roth 401k are funded with after tax money so the difference is whether you pay taxes now or in retirement
[4:30:20] tymen90: ah man you were playing so well. if you won this was a tuber for sure
[4:30:52] visuna: what are your S tier supports for agressive gameplay

[4:31:55] everyman322: @shinyclodsire roth 401k is more like a 401k in that it has higher contributions and is employer sponsored, but both roth 401k and roth ira are post tax contributions
[4:31:59] MDAos: how is thresh doing this patch?

[4:34:53] denunciator: good joke +2
[4:34:55] Endz_Nz: work untill u die Sadge
[4:35:02] pretzel_ikz: roth you never pay taxes on your initial money regardless of when you pull it out. You only pay penalties and taxes if taken out too early

[4:36:43] pretzel_ikz: @everyman322 read what i said again... lol I said you DON"T pay taxes ever. You only pay taxes and penalties on GAINS if taken out early
[4:37:17] kite0_0: last season was such a mess
[4:37:21] pretzel_ikz: but yes the money put in is already post tax income
[4:37:22] dissolusioned: is it the lack of mythics?
[4:37:24] everyman322: @pretzel_ikz read what I said again you have to pay income taxes on the money before it even goes in...
[4:37:59] visuna: wait i had 3 ads can you repeat that
[4:38:14] tymen90: for me it was nice to learn the game in that era. not having to think too much about items

[4:47:14] PekinWoof: the taste is different too
[4:47:21] everyman322: depends. the metamorphic ones can shine under pressure, igneous are on fire when they first come out, and sedimentary can build over time

[5:11:29] memost1: duo with saber?
[5:11:30] wilfrLd: ok nt
[5:11:54] ledoz: @redtauro agree, should be mroe distinct differences like his base
[5:12:51] memost1: why are they against it?
[5:12:52] everyman322: I'm sure NA will be one of them
[5:13:14] redtauro: @ledoz apparently Riot said they never intended his spell books to be obviously different to opponents by having different colors. So, they might actually not give us different colors for his next skins
[5:13:47] i0ki: riot loves their "competitive integrity"
[5:13:49] ledoz: PepeHands @redtauro

[5:14:42] redtauro: I already have a sugar intake problems Weirdge
[5:14:48] memost1: I've always felt like you learn so much more when you play against really good players. Sure it sucks to lose, but ultimately you get so much better at the game
[5:14:53] everyman322: europe has like twice the population as NA, and way lower ping

[5:15:26] waveofpanic: that sounds disgusting
[5:15:40] vogue_hommes: ono
[5:15:45] zerpentinefire: Uuuuh, noooo
[5:15:50] galentine_: thats kind of like halo halo
[5:15:51] zerpentinefire: Boil it first
[5:15:52] everyman322: depends how many animals poop and pee on it
[5:15:53] iamnolan4: you take the snow off the top of a pile of fresh snow
[5:15:55] ash_chiming: stunt I‚Äôm feeling kind of depressed and it is now your responsibility to fix it (not really, obviously)
[5:15:59] redtauro: Internet food experiments should have stopped after the whipped instant Dalgona Coffee during Covid
[5:16:01] zerpentinefire: There's all sorts of things in the snow..
[5:16:06] zerpentinefire: Even in the wilrd
[5:16:07] GTnoof: what is your favorite protein?
[5:16:17] Serverlord: Yuck please. STOP watching this
[5:16:20] shinyclodsire: dr phil
[5:16:29] everyman322: if there's snow on your floor you got roof problems to worry about
[5:16:33] MajinBuubs: is this milk steak
[5:16:50] zerpentinefire: Everyone's responsible for theor own well being, can't put that on someone else's shoulders. :)
[5:16:58] zerpentinefire: their*
[5:17:02] Serverlord: Bite size pieces? thats like two pieces per a bread slice
[5:17:04] ash_chiming: facts
[5:17:12] waveofpanic: i feel like people mess up chicken less
[5:17:23] TwitchTime89: did you know that every single snowflake is a different shape than all the other snowflakes? No two snowflakes are the same. That's amazing to me!
[5:17:32] Serverlord: OK if they dunk this fruit into sugar or deep fry it I am muting myself.
[5:17:43] memost1: @TwitchTime89 Wait really ?!?!
[5:17:44] waveofpanic: australian peaches are in season now and they are sooo juicy
[5:17:46] redtauro: Chicken is harder to cook bad, I think. Like it is still edible. But I feel that you can mess up red meat much easier
[5:17:51] everyman322: low quality beef can at least be decent hamburger. ground chicken is kinda worthless though imo
[5:18:03] waveofpanic: a bad peach is not even worth eating
[5:18:14] shinyclodsire: i need to have poly send me a box of australian peaches
[5:18:18] whatgalaxies: @TwitchTime89 snowflakes under a microscope are so pretty PrideUwu
[5:18:31] flowerchild_nz: @waveofpanic they‚Äôre still like $9 a kg here in NZ. Makes me so sad
[5:18:35] Serverlord: @waveofpanic My Peach tree (gifted) in Melb Aus, had 10 Peaches. FIrst time growing. Tasted so good.
[5:18:37] TwitchTime89: @whatgalaxies IKR?!!! They are soooo pretty
[5:18:39] everyman322: I've only had ripe and unripe peaches, never a particularly bad one
[5:18:50] shinyclodsire: no its a syrup
[5:19:00] mahbuhl: i thought this was soup for a sec
[5:19:05] redtauro: I think peaches arent strong enough to strongly flavor something like this.
[5:19:12] GTnoof: tomato and basil is the OG combo
[5:19:31] everyman322: seems like most berries vary wildly in quality. except like raspberries are always exactly the same flavor
[5:19:37] waveofpanic: suckling pig!
[5:19:37] redtauro: fruit compote?
[5:19:48] jasmine_petals_: pig ears r yum!
[5:19:51] zerpentinefire: whaat
[5:19:55] RiftJockel: i find pork no good tbh
[5:19:57] Datous: and pig intestine

[5:20:15] mahbuhl: ahh pig ear and intestine so good
[5:20:18] Datous: hahaha so good deep fired
[5:20:19] RiftJockel: beef duck and chicken are the best
[5:20:20] TwitchTime89: it did
[5:20:20] Datous: fried*
[5:20:24] TwitchTime89: smh
[5:20:35] ProfessionalDilettante: wait they're making a cake? i just read the description
[5:20:36] TwitchTime89: it's ok. I'm ok now
[5:20:41] Serverlord: @redtauro I think both are dependent on the part of the animal tbh. Chicken breast is tough as if not prepped right, the thigh is alot more tender, but requires more attention, but with red meat expecially beef it varies alot with the cut
[5:20:57] redtauro: ugh, my grandma made a lot of stuffed intestine (Turkish cuisine). I hate the smell and I never ever had it WeirdDude
[5:20:58] ash_chiming: this is some tea right bere

[5:21:31] jannablowsu: id be so bad about stuff bc i cant eat a lot of foods
[5:21:32] Datous: lmao I understand, I was like that at first but realised how many nice things I was missing out on
[5:21:33] flowerchild_nz: she is an absolute legend for even trying it
[5:21:51] waveofpanic: to be fair, pig intestines can be quite vile if they dont prepare it properly
[5:21:55] redtauro: @Serverlord yeah texture can be easily messed up in both. But flavorwise, I find Chicken to play better with more amateur or quick recipes. Red meat can taste bland or bad if not well done. This is how I perceive though.
[5:21:56] bored_degen: is not wanting to eat intestine = picky?
[5:21:58] Serverlord: @redtauro We had Lambs fry once a week. It was Lamb liver, bacon and cant remember what else lol. But it was horrible. Dad loved it
[5:21:59] shinyclodsire: maybe its a mf game
[5:22:00] ash_chiming: good to know we‚Äôre not meant to be, stunt ü´°
[5:22:01] everyman322: if you think you aren't going to like something, there's a very high chance you won't like it. so much of food preference is mental
[5:22:02] jmangs34: Not eating intestines is picky?
[5:22:11] flowerchild_nz: for a
[5:22:12] ledoz: senna
[5:22:15] ledoz: senna or mf
[5:22:21] shinyclodsire: oh this is fine yea
[5:22:23] redtauro: @Serverlord liver is so popular here too. The texture gives my whole body revulsion LUL
[5:22:32] GTnoof: wow look at those skins
[5:22:43] jasmine_petals_: pig intestine kbbq!!
[5:22:44] jannablowsu: what about not eating things bc you know it will make you sick
[5:22:52] ledoz: that head looks so weird monakW
[5:23:02] residentgaming_: lucky for you I‚Äôm not picky with food lol
[5:23:17] Serverlord: @redtauro Yeah chicken great. I dislike it now, ate to much in my life. But I do enjoy trying to make it decent etc for family etc that come around.
[5:23:21] waveofpanic: i feel so much about trying new food is also a frame of mind... i once told some french tourists to think of durian like a strong blue cheese and they felt a lot calmer about eatin git
[5:23:54] jannablowsu: TRUE
[5:24:01] TwitchTime89: same!!!!!!
[5:24:05] denunciator: this is why i prefer overchooked chicken :x
[5:24:05] pretzel_ikz: use Sous vide
[5:24:06] Ellazys: cook your chicken sous vide and it's perfect every time
[5:24:09] Atanaxe: it took me a long time to realize cooking longer is not better. :/
[5:24:10] redtauro: @Serverlord I also consume it a lot and have been trying to stay away for the last few months. The simpleness of it makes me want to utilize it for protein a lot haha
[5:24:13] TwitchTime89: @pretzel_ikz me too!!!!
[5:24:15] Ellazys: @pretzel_ikz that's whats up
[5:24:26] negraodaniel: just brine the chicken and dont have this problem ever again
[5:24:36] redtauro: I always use a meat thermometer. 168F, 76C is where salmonella dies apparently
[5:24:45] ash_chiming: why did you immediately mute senna
[5:24:55] jasmine_petals_: i use meat thermo stat too DangoPls
[5:25:02] ash_chiming: oh ew
[5:25:04] Serverlord: There should be no open option for salmolana with chicken if it is originally prepared and stored correctly though :)
[5:25:14] waveofpanic: what's the best way to prep and cook chicken breast w/o a sous vide machine?
[5:25:45] TwitchTime89: you can boil it,or cut it up in strips and fry it
[5:26:03] TwitchTime89: add spices to taste
[5:26:12] waveofpanic: yea ive been just boiling it but thinking of switching it up
[5:26:14] denunciator: chimken tendies? :O
[5:26:18] redtauro: I wish we had pasteurized eggs in Turkey. I would love to make dessert recipes with raw eggs in it like authentic chocolate mousse, etc
[5:26:36] Ellazys: @waveofpanic cut it up and stir fry it - that is always good
[5:26:46] Serverlord: Game Over?
[5:26:53] Serverlord: Or is it my end?
[5:27:00] Serverlord: My end
[5:27:03] Serverlord: all good

[5:28:57] karmentena: wait is this 21 jump street?
[5:29:05] Serverlord: @TwitchTime89 I like to tenderise it with bicarb soda etc, and then sit the chicken strips etc in a homemade marinade for 4+ hours. (same with beef). I find the cheaper cuts come out better also;
[5:29:06] karmentena: 21 pilot thign
[5:29:08] karmentena: omg
[5:29:08] redtauro: these are such nice 'covers' of these mainstream songs

[5:30:37] karmentena: you scale?
[5:30:48] TwitchTime89: @redtauro how do you use eggs then?
[5:30:52] Serverlord: 21 Pilots, 21 jump street, but also a band I loved back in the day with their one or two songs
[5:30:54] negraodaniel: bro has 11 cs on 6m
[5:31:10] everyman322: @TwitchTime89 cooked?
[5:31:17] ash_chiming: let senna cook lol
[5:31:21] ash_chiming: she‚Äôs inspiring them
[5:31:35] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 so how do you make a cake etc. then?
[5:31:53] Serverlord: Wait what are pasterized eggs compared to the normal eggs you buy from a supermarket?
[5:31:54] redtauro: @everyman322 apparently it's only common in EU
[5:32:06] everyman322: @TwitchTime89 uh you bake the cake?
[5:32:11] karmentena: twitch is so annoying
[5:32:15] redtauro: @TwitchTime89 cooking. or you mix it with something boiled like chocolate etc
[5:32:27] bored_degen: i kinda want to see what the senna is typing now
[5:32:30] Serverlord: Oh its normal here
[5:32:33] Serverlord: Pasteurized shell eggs are heated in warm water baths using controlled time and temperature, to destroy any bacteria that might be present, but the process does not cook the eggs. Any process used for eggs in shell pasteurization has to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
[5:32:38] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 then why do you need pasteurized eggs if you always cook/bake them anyway? who eats raw eggs? lol
[5:32:39] ash_chiming: yeah unmute the senna lol for the memes
[5:33:10] bored_degen: @TwitchTime89 the japanese like mixing raw egg into rice
[5:33:13] redtauro: @TwitchTime89 some recipes use them raw. Like authentic chocolate mousse
[5:33:16] SofiaRochinha: morning
[5:33:31] bladetrinity16: goodnight stunt and chat, hope you all have wonderful day/night bla
[5:33:31] redtauro: in my initial comment, I said i would love to try the recipes that utilize raw eggs
[5:33:36] flowerchild_nz: @serverlord why are you talking about eggs? Doesn‚Äôt relate to league of legends.
[5:33:38] TwitchTime89: @redtauro oh wow. ok
[5:33:41] ash_chiming: @bladetrinity16 goodnight
[5:33:49] Serverlord: I eat eggs popped out of chickens now and then. But I don't eat them raw. I just cook them on a stove
[5:33:52] TwitchTime89: gn @bladetrinity16
[5:33:54] redtauro: @flowerchild_nz Anivia would like to have a word PunOko
[5:34:05] everyman322: @TwitchTime89 oh are you asking why someone would want pasteurized eggs? for edible cookie dough, some classic cocktails, and as the other guy said some desserts. homemade eggnog
[5:34:11] Serverlord: @flowerchild_nz Because other people are. I am an Eggspert.
[5:34:38] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 yes, that answers it. thank you
[5:34:42] softlysupports: @bladetrinity16 gn! sleepwell
[5:34:44] flowerchild_nz: @serverlord when we were talking about other topics you told us all we shouldn‚Äôt speak about anything but league of legends‚Ä¶
[5:34:46] softlysupports: blanketJam
[5:34:47] TwitchTime89: @flowerchild_nz ICANT
[5:35:05] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[5:35:13] redtauro: @Serverlord how dare you PunOko
[5:35:21] TwitchTime89: @flowerchild_nz oops. that was meant for someone else. sorry
[5:35:26] Serverlord: @flowerchild_nz That was yesterday, and they were talking about personal off topic things. I think there is a clear difference.
[5:35:34] TwitchTime89: @flowerchild_nz ICANT
[5:35:43] luuispotatoe3: 19 to 8 at 10 mins challenger so different
[5:36:02] redtauro: @TwitchTime89 you luled at the same thing again :D
[5:36:16] everyman322: fun fact, to make edible cookie dough you don't only need pasteurized eggs, flour is apparently not safe to eat raw so you have to bake it first
[5:36:23] TwitchTime89: oh noooooooooooooooo!!! lmao @redtauro
[5:36:24] flowerchild_nz: @twitchtime89 so misogyny in league of legends = personal and off-topic, but eggs = fine?
[5:37:00] TwitchTime89: @flowerchild_nz i didn't say anything about not talking off topic. it was someone else
[5:37:06] Serverlord: @flowerchild_nz Do you want to remind what the whole chat what we were talking about (as in what the chat was talking about), but not me? I left the chat. If talking about eggs bothers you. I will leave the chat again.
[5:37:17] flowerchild_nz: @twitchtime89 sorry omg clicked the wrong reply mb
[5:37:29] TwitchTime89: @flowerchild_nz it's ok. lol
[5:37:46] BaneBladeV: game is fake news NODDERS
[5:37:57] flowerchild_nz: @serverlord eggs do not bother me, was just wondering the distinction
[5:38:26] TwitchTime89: awww
[5:38:59] everyman322: can't everyone be named "T1 Faker" now?
[5:39:02] WorldSpermBank: hello mr. stunt
[5:39:43] Serverlord: @flowerchild_nz  flowerchild_nz: @serverlord when we were talking about other topics you told us all we shouldn‚Äôt speak about anything but league of legends‚Ä¶ It was the topic that was being talked about sorry maybe I was a bit broad. I'm out. I'll see you all tomorrow.
[5:40:03] karmentena: hubris on twitch?
[5:40:06] TwitchTime89: gn @Serverlord
[5:40:24] everyman322: did he say world's perm bank?  like where the world's hair perms are stored for safekeeping?
[5:40:42] Arilee: idk if I miss the good games but I swear every time I see Seraphine in challenger matches they get stomped.
[5:40:50] redtauro: Exactly. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you're forbidden to wet your hair for at least 24 hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the ammonium thioglycolate?
[5:40:55] luuispotatoe3: how do you deal with such a fast pace game without being mad at teammates due to kills being given?
[5:40:56] ash_chiming: ah yes team eating each other alive
[5:41:48] Ali3va: we missed like all our e bro xd
[5:41:48] TwitchTime89: vibee
[5:41:54] TwitchTime89: gg
[5:41:56] TwitchTime89: no chance
[5:42:07] BaneBladeV: akali tlitproof owo
[5:42:22] whatgalaxies: @redtauro And wouldn't somebody who's had, say, thirty perms before in their life be well aware of this rule?
[5:42:36] negraodaniel: if irelia was a human being it would be winnable
[5:42:51] ash_chiming: let‚Äôs go back to talking about ROTH IRAs lol
[5:42:55] ghostringtft: high elo doesnt look fun
[5:43:01] ledoz: diamond looks rough
[5:43:06] redtauro: @whatgalaxies I was afraid no one would get the reference PepeHands <3
[5:43:19] everyman322: @luuispotatoe3 a teammate once told me "stay mad" and I thought it was an interesting strategy so I've just been mad ever since YEP
[5:43:22] whatgalaxies: @redtauro LUL
[5:43:29] ledoz: @luuispotatoe3 LUL
[5:43:30] TwitchTime89: @redtauro i thought it was funny.
[5:43:41] redtauro: Elle Woods is my idol LUL
[5:44:44] luuispotatoe3: im in silver trying climb but def have to be more conservative with the plays due to the lack of players game knowledge from the info i gather lol

[5:46:15] SofiaRochinha: @ledoz Susge
[5:46:22] luuispotatoe3: mooose plays that as well another lol streamer
[5:46:32] Deku_Dreaming: But it is kinda annoying for me cuz somewhat often the connections are based on American English/common knowledge (like american sweets or smtg)
[5:46:34] everyman322: @daryrmorghulis that's funny, most people consider the 3 movies like 2-3 movies each ;)
[5:46:36] ledoz: @SofiaRochinha it was even a ashe player, so it was even more susge
[5:46:55] galentine_: summit top peak crest
