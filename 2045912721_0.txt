[0:43:30] redsevn: is it legal to stream this toplane
[0:43:42] yalestream: maybe not give rumble to zeus and then leave him on an island
[0:43:44] redsevn: turns out this is a porno stream after all ;)
[0:43:51] najafan: OHHHH

[0:44:24] e6merald6: viego was trolling there. I think he would live if he didn't get the soul
[0:44:29] SomeFerretGuy: @zionsick disappointingly competent
[0:44:34] aBitTooHircine: that first dive didnt help
[0:44:37] SudoBandit: no rock at royal rumble ;-;
[0:44:51] mjoll_the_hotness: zeus got a champion ocean right
[0:44:56] grandezelx: it honestly seems like t1 bot lane always gets banned the most
[0:44:57] Naxser: @MonteCristo Is Zeus the best top laner in the LCK?
[0:45:00] zionsick: NA sh!ts the bed, I stopped watch LCS/LEC, just LCK+LPL
[0:45:00] yalestream: i don't think i have seen somebody survive the zeus rumble
[0:45:12] maletroll: red side botlane looks really fun
[0:45:15] zionsick: watching*. OMG my english today is shit, sorry.
[0:45:30] Wilbo007: dude even his teacher calls him zionspartan
[0:45:42] VanidarD: yo Monte, did you watch that GenG DK game already? that series was seriosly bonkers, really high quality
[0:45:42] SomeFerretGuy: RaccAttack
[0:45:47] zen__cloud: flyquest games are kindof interesting though @MonteCristo
[0:45:50] rilsolo: where else would we go for honest opinions on lec and lcs
[0:45:54] aBitTooHircine: RaccAttack
[0:45:56] TFTHardOrGoHome: crazy to call dgon and dom racoons
[0:46:04] mjoll_the_hotness: need to watch lcs and lec for the meme games and comedic relief Kappa
[0:46:04] zionsick: LCS and LEC Is not fun anymore.
[0:46:11] littleindianman12: Hey monte loved the kcorp video that you did. I had a good chuckle watching targamas live int upset and bo
[0:46:14] e6merald6: why no live co stream?

[0:46:17] andyfatknob: soul fighter?
[0:46:19] Dreamchosis: soul fighter
[0:46:19] KRAMZiEyeyz: RaccAttack
[0:46:21] SnowKayn: soul fighter
[0:46:23] grandezelx: soul fighter
[0:46:28] Civiss: I mean, I don't watch LCS for the quality. I watch because it's on when I'm awake. vods for lck/lpl only
[0:46:29] SnowKayn: its my fav :(
[0:46:29] Jeffp2662: taking the 1 grub likely killed all desire for the grubs and created all the action in bot
[0:46:29] 1DeepBlue: we'll know LCS is truly dead when people stop asking you about LCS games
[0:46:29] Turole: @zionsick You don't like watching fiestas that make you sigh in sadness from the strange decision making?
[0:46:30] Kodord: i was gonna say someone alreay mentioned that LUL
[0:46:37] zlGunitlz: thoughts on lcs downsizing to 8 teams?
[0:46:39] najafan: Panda with a monocle and top hat as well?
[0:46:41] Zebrios: I mean he kind of is a Castlevania character.
[0:46:45] GelatoSquid: @zionsick watching LCS is depressing, even as an LCS fan
[0:46:48] Adanion: Is that the one where he has Soul Edge? The csorta cel shaded look
[0:46:55] mjoll_the_hotness: ayy lmao
[0:47:00] xeherxan: lmao
[0:47:00] arthradot: i like the chunky lineart of the soul fighter and fright night skins
[0:47:02] lazink: do they still have banned skins in pro play?
[0:47:04] zlGunitlz: fair lmao
[0:47:07] zionsick: you could have another podcast with those hours free
[0:47:11] joeshang: @lazink yes
[0:47:18] GelatoSquid: C9 is gonna keep winning LCS until the LCS collapses and nobody cares about any other team
[0:47:18] Turole: It would make worlds cleaner, just give everyone the free win they were going to get from the LCS team
[0:47:19] StuntmanStan: RaccAttack but we need to eat
[0:47:23] Adanion: yeah its soul fighter Viego
[0:47:26] truthlol: are you watching the new true detective?
[0:47:31] yalestream: swap LCS for "random Clash on NA server"
[0:47:32] Turole: Let the pros play against audience members and it would be functionally the same
[0:47:33] sneakygoat022: LCS used to be exciting even though it was bad but now it just boring
[0:47:33] TheMommik: banned skins, banned ineractions
[0:47:36] najafan: Does C9 just move to another region>

[0:47:37] knightfork13: hows the overwatch league casting
[0:47:37] Adanion: They have an entire line like that, its basically Anime jojo esque the skin line
[0:47:41] TFTHardOrGoHome: would astralis from last year have made it out of bo1 in lec this year?
[0:47:50] mjoll_the_hotness: i think lcs and lec should just combine forces vs the evil asians who keep winning everything
[0:47:56] zionsick: @GelatoSquid Yeah, I gave up.
[0:47:59] itsame_martin: do you know about the results of the series before doing bangers only?
[0:48:16] axeman_ow: was tes edg not banger enough for u monte :(
[0:48:24] truthlol: new true detective is good so far
[0:48:26] GelatoSquid: the Meteos/sneaky/DL costreams were keeping me going but this season I just don't care anymore
[0:48:36] DuncMasterFlex_: KT should have put maknoon on kha this ksante aint it
[0:48:39] knightfork13: what would a perfect pro lol league look like?
[0:48:44] SudoBandit: overwatch 2 pro league gonna be lit though
[0:48:49] najafan: S1 was also bad, because it could have been weird, uncanny fiction, but decided to be a lame detective story about a cult instead.
[0:48:51] karlheinzstockfootage: watching lcs is b01s and is done in two hours.  lec is worse.  they are still allowed to have 10 teams
[0:49:34] yalestream: i am still hoping for a revamped ban/pick to force more champs into the pool for my personal enjoyment
[0:49:56] lazink: @dalimccubist lcs broadcasts are just as long, mandatory pauses
[0:50:02] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Thoughts on the teams being able to draft before going on stage to save downtime between games?
[0:50:02] karlheinzstockfootage: lec is allowed to have an entire retired g2 team called heretix
[0:50:02] deep8719: S1 true detective is certified banger, check ur tastes
[0:50:08] maletroll: is seraphs rush good?
[0:50:29] zionsick: damn...
[0:50:42] sneakygoat022: why they just didnt do it earlier
[0:50:44] karlheinzstockfootage: 4 lcs and 4 lec teams should be in one league
[0:50:49] rehvolutionz: That play is the epitome if being a KT fan.
[0:51:00] najafan: True Detective could have been Lovecraft Country but also reference Nietzsche and suchlike, but it decided to be just another detective show instead.
[0:51:05] yalestream: dear god those rumble items
[0:51:14] Raydriar: viego was still walking up?
[0:51:24] karlheinzstockfootage: @lazink opposed to rando pauses.  so lec lasts 6 hours
[0:51:24] joeshang: bdd placed his bet on esportsbets
[0:51:44] Zebrios: isn't this the series that T1 goes serious mode and ends game 2 in like 20 mins?
[0:51:54] Raydriar: beryl ThankEgg
[0:52:02] warl0rdggg: Does KT need more time to figure out stuff they have good drafts and Marco they just make to many mistakes that cost them games ?
[0:52:09] Carbonetics: beryl smurfin game 1
[0:52:09] mikejanderson: the mad genius
[0:52:11] StuntmanStan: why do Koreans use english igns or is that just for the english broadcast
[0:52:12] mjoll_the_hotness: and it was rumble also
[0:52:17] arthradot: beryl thinks it’s 2022 world finals
[0:52:17] SqueektheWeek: the Adderall was hitting for beryl this game
[0:52:24] joeshang: Beryl always been the second greatest player of all time
[0:52:25] Adanion: Surely we need Berly in that worlds hat as an emote too
[0:52:30] Zebrios: @StuntmanStan Riot made them
[0:52:30] Adanion: He is clearly the GOAT
[0:52:32] deep8719: @najafan I think u just didn't pick up everything it put down, put ur hat back on
[0:52:33] PachoNimi: 2 time world chhampion btw
[0:52:42] karlheinzstockfootage: secret thing, all true dective years were not good ever
[0:52:42] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:52:45] FuHua_HoS: and the fed rumble
[0:52:48] joeshang: imagine thinking Keria was better than Beryl
[0:52:50] saxobeat420: Will you watch DRX vs BRO and HLE vs T1 later today?
[0:53:02] RDKi: Spoiler: only on Alistar
[0:53:07] zionsick: BTW Monte, what's your general opinion on the new map? Good, bad, meh?
[0:53:09] joeshang: yo wtf is this windowed
[0:53:18] maletroll: Keria's been underperforming for a bit now
[0:53:20] StuntmanStan: why do they play windowed
[0:53:20] TFTHardOrGoHome: warmed up his hands before the game
[0:53:20] Adanion: All the GOATs play windowed
[0:53:23] acroyck: classic korean playing in a small window. OG
[0:53:23] rodeocrazy: Cooked setup
[0:53:28] commando1814: feels like kt skt must be crazy
[0:53:29] najafan: @deep8719 Oh, I got it. It just had potential to be so much better, and it threw it away.
[0:53:32] CrowComeOverLoL: i forgot korean pros play window mode lol
[0:53:39] Rumblextristana: Is there a reason some korean pros play windows?
[0:53:42] najafan: It set itself up for greatness, and was content to just be good.
[0:53:43] Adanion: Gotta save space for the gacha games man
[0:53:45] saxobeat420: they play windowed cause the screens are huge and they want their peripheral vision to see everything
[0:53:45] yalestream: Beryl skilled player but that is not normally, This very very insane....They need to check him pc and game
[0:53:50] karlheinzstockfootage: gen is better at all five positions than t1 currently
[0:53:51] acroyck: have you seen Bisu play starcraft in a 640x480 window
[0:53:51] mage1o1: @Rumblextristana you see more in a smaller space
[0:53:52] zen__cloud: that's the same argument for black bars in cs
[0:53:56] StuntmanStan: can they use notepad while playing
[0:54:05] deep8719: Lol u acting like s1 pulled a GoT
[0:54:08] divine_killjaeden: me playing on 27 inch
[0:54:08] najafan: It failed the landing, making the entire thing worse by proxy.
[0:54:09] Gikeuri13: I play windowed (not a goat), my monitor feels too big full screen. See way easier like monte saying when it's smaller
[0:54:15] Rumblextristana: @mage1o1 Thanks
[0:54:21] Zebrios: Oner inted
[0:54:35] del1nquency: telecom wars are so fun
[0:54:55] yalestream: its also to have the same resolution regardless of monitor
[0:55:00] CrowComeOverLoL: fakers quote about azir ori matchup was funny. he said "hit your abilities and dodge thiers"
[0:55:01] sneakygoat022: HLE VS t1 tonight!!!!!
[0:55:04] SomeFerretGuy: imagine playing league on like a 32" monitor that's terrible
[0:55:12] Nimosenpai: @SomeFerretGuy i DO
[0:55:20] Wando05: what monitor size do they use in pro play?
[0:55:22] Nimosenpai: Its terrible
[0:55:28] mjoll_the_hotness: does lord faker play on windowed cant remember
[0:55:29] SomeFerretGuy: @SomeFerretGuy now you know why you suck? LuL
[0:55:37] sneakygoat022: i use a mac to play league it is perfect
[0:55:42] zlrenyth: i play on a 32 Aware
[0:55:47] wwinter__: 24 is perfect
[0:55:47] warl0rdggg: Thoughts on this version of KT?
[0:55:52] yalestream: i still remember Flash havin exact measurements of keyboard placement
[0:55:52] commando1814: is it like 4:3 for r6 ?
[0:55:58] Corgax: I play on 32 and it's great for immersion haha
[0:55:58] dianstyle: old game 24 is perfect
[0:56:16] IrishProphet: So what you're saying is the reason I'm bad is I play full screen 🤔
[0:56:23] Wando05: pro play uses 24-25” monitors no?
[0:56:41] TFTHardOrGoHome: u can also back off further from the monitor, but on stage u kkind of cant
[0:56:45] Nytrodark: DRX vs BRO at 3pm today ResidentSleeper fuck that series. i hope that series is quick
[0:56:47] najafan: Okay, but imagine if you've got like a 14" laptop. Having that windowed would be awful.
[0:56:49] dianstyle: is there a standard for pro play monitor size?
[0:56:51] najafan: lol
[0:56:56] dowiet: 420 kda on zeus PogChamp
[0:57:00] yalestream: the t1 special, only put in place by the fnatic bush tbh
[0:57:03] sneakygoat022: @MonteCristo are you watching live games tonight too?
[0:57:13] AltaDark: doesn't frame rate get capped on windowed making it bad  ?
[0:57:39] TFTHardOrGoHome: @AltaDark no why would it
[0:57:42] sandblade4: who did kt lose to?

[1:03:10] Nimosenpai: ints, saves enemy midlaner
[1:03:10] HordeWargasm: bro  forgot where that wall  takes him
[1:03:12] itsame_martin: beryl did push out faker from the taliyah w too though
[1:03:15] dakwka: PerfecT looked so rough so far but it's really hard to gauge him as a player when KT has been all-in on bot every series
[1:03:18] RDKi: in solo queue that naut hook hits 120% of the time
[1:03:57] d_kowalski: Beryl is saving his power for his 3rd title
[1:04:14] pedrolito_lol: that's like triple anti synergy
[1:04:27] yalestream: cant expect a jungler to hit skillshots
[1:04:31] Astrotaur: If you play with an Alistar, you have to let him use his spells first
[1:04:39] aoersie: Must be bugged on Viego Kappa
[1:05:04] dakwka: 6 world titles between them!
[1:05:08] rehvolutionz: Beryl first inductee into the hall of legends or whatever it's called Kappa
[1:05:08] d_kowalski: No mere midlaner could ever be the goat
[1:05:21] yalestream: keria saved faker by hooking Taliyah at the perfect moment on that dive
[1:05:32] Zebrios: See, the problem with Beryl playing well is the he made Faker mad for game 2.

[1:07:59] HollowBilly: @Astrotaur ah ok, which players rival faker in individual skill?
[1:08:04] Astrotaur: BeezyLAN I think you can take any combination of 2 players in this game and they would win 2vs5 games against randoms
[1:08:05] Charca773: death = fast recall
[1:08:05] SomeFerretGuy: mustelidae unite

[1:09:54] Jeffp2662: 625 stacks feels so bad
[1:09:55] zionsick: I think zeus ults this game werent the best
[1:10:07] Charca773: draven ult execute gotta be massive
[1:10:45] Astrotaur: A utility ADC would have been a better choice maybe ?
[1:11:01] Zebrios: Ezreal maybe
[1:11:24] HordeWargasm: esp  when KT pick ali to counter
[1:11:26] yalestream: this woulda been an amazing ashe game tbh
[1:11:33] zionsick: Did aphelios get banned in this game?
[1:11:35] vsmilotic: t1 draft it because they expect to win all 3 lane i think?

[1:13:16] Jeffp2662: love atlas
[1:13:20] RDKi: People like to hate on the LCK casters for some reason
[1:13:21] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo i went on 2 dates with this korea girls from korea, but is it true alot of korean women have plastic surgeries?
[1:13:21] AltaDark: is it just me or do lck/casters never promote any sponsors?
[1:13:29] divine_killjaeden: over capital glowers?
[1:13:31] burne114: How do you feel about the world atlas?
[1:13:42] Astrotaur: RDKi because they're not Monte ? Kappa
[1:13:50] SomeFerretGuy: is that because all the other good ones left casting? or is he the best the game has had?
[1:13:51] commando1814: both can be fun
[1:13:52] Zebrios: @StealingYoIPZ Plastic surgery is a common 16th birthday gift there.
[1:13:55] pedrolito_lol: i think captain flowers has been a little too monotonous for a while now tbh
[1:13:57] Dreamchosis: does ubershouts still cast? enjoyed him in ow
[1:13:58] arthradot: i like variety
[1:14:05] Sjkaev: oh damn i missed the first game
[1:14:08] RDKi: I do not like CaptainFlowers at all as a caster - he feels incredibly fake... I get that people like him, though
[1:14:14] itsame_martin: do you guys prep things to say in case a player pops off or is that all on the spot
[1:14:14] Astrotaur: Corki ?
[1:14:16] zionsick: I like Atlas and Valdes
[1:14:18] StealingYoIPZ: @Zebrios WOW WHAT?!??!?!?
[1:14:18] Astrotaur: Is he viable ?
[1:14:20] Gypcian: SInce the new season has changed ADC whats your favorite adc meta
[1:14:20] mjoll_the_hotness: monte, doa and papa still best. the telekom war casts were an event
[1:14:21] notMase: why do they all have bowl cuts
[1:14:24] clippityycloppityy: 16th bday present

[1:14:49] Amosdragon: Base Skin Corki peepoSad
[1:14:51] commando1814: I always forget how blessed I was to grow up with the tbs skip Carrey sass
[1:15:05] TheMommik: I don't like to listen to uncut LS too much, but I loved to listen to him on LCK broadcast, that's how good Atlus is.
[1:15:05] Jeffp2662: like the jinx
[1:15:07] Zebrios: Tahm is an entire NOPE
[1:15:17] yalestream: picking Jinx into Deft
[1:15:23] itsame_martin: keria plays tahm like an engage champ
[1:15:28] lavi666: which Esport do you wish LFN could extend to?
[1:15:28] RDKi: I genuinely think that Jinx has a place in the meta but no one is touching her
[1:15:29] vsmilotic: nah tahm provide heavy engage
[1:15:29] Zebrios: Keria Tahm is different though, because it's also an engage champ
[1:15:30] Adanion: that plastic surgery point is not something I'd have expected out of Korea for some reason
[1:15:34] jimbo002y: tk nullifies vi yep
[1:15:50] LordAnomandaris: Is Jinx a good pick in the Lethality focused ADC meta?
[1:15:54] yalestream: both those adc's play on a million range later on
[1:15:57] commando1814: I always like Bren and sideshows banter .
[1:15:57] SomeFerretGuy: they like advertise plastic surgery on tv stations everywhere

[1:16:40] TheMommik: The social pressure to be pretty and perfect is insane
[1:16:51] Civiss: It's so hard to get away from the eastern look with plastic surgery. Wife thinks she needs them because everyone she knows got it done D:
[1:16:51] swayyxo: A lot of girls get plastic surgery voucher for double eyelid as like 16th bday gift etc. They want it, idk

[1:19:36] SomeFerretGuy: here's the recent team all time video
[1:19:37] yalestream: SSW is still the most dominant tournament victory i have ever seen. Pawn just played a different champ every game for most of it
[1:19:37] Carbonetics: basically top 5 if i member ssw was goated
[1:19:44] lavi666: are you a hockey fan?

[1:20:25] Carbonetics: no ssw was the favorite at worlds, but prior was getting dominated by ssb
[1:20:28] kshyle: @commando1814 was it a damwon idea
[1:20:30] Hnaidrelle: Thanks! I'll watch it after this game... Game 1 of 2014 finals was sooo calculated. Fondest memories of u and DoA casting <3

[1:20:55] TheMommik: @MonteCristo you're underestimating Corki, as you'll see later in the game. He doesn't need 3 items
[1:20:56] LAX_x1: and how zeus can zeus
[1:20:58] RDKi: These last two years + this year looks to be shaping up to be the same, have spoiled us. GenG, T1, KT, BLG, TOP have all been very good

[1:56:31] najafan: He said Jayce only works because Lethality items have so much ms.
[1:56:36] LuxtheGod: ap kog is just a great value corki
[1:57:33] fljqpy: jayce has 6 skills its not fair
[1:57:39] Kodord: why is the stream paused on a picture of a goat
[1:57:47] najafan: @fljqpy tbf, that's what they said about the game in 2015, when AP Kog first emerged.

[1:58:27] danny_yoos: been watching clg clips and do you have any stories with the seraph line up?

[1:59:03] Zebrios: Monte used to be a KT fan.  Then he took a KT Arrow to the knee.
[1:59:08] vvtchcrft777: I know your time with Riot wasn't great, but you and DoA casting LCK was what got me into league esports. I'll forever be a fan, Monte. @MonteCristo
[1:59:29] edenjtv: @MonteCristo  do you think that any Esport game will ever reach viewership level of a traditional sport?
[1:59:40] Zebrios: This is the most tragic BDD Azir game.
[1:59:41] Pep_bardiola: this games midlane laning phase was very fun to watch
[1:59:58] wwinter__: Faker was dicking bdd this game
[2:00:11] ASquishyLiquid: Plenty of eSports have reached the viewership of "a" traditional sport
[2:00:16] Zebrios: Faker goes full bully
[2:00:19] yalestream: lucian doesnt need much protecting, so poppy isnt needed

[2:00:51] RathXII: I've heart blue eye is really good I need to watch it still
[2:00:56] edenjtv: @ASquishyLiquid not really lol, the NFL for example averaged 17.9 million viewers per game
[2:01:02] vvtchcrft777: @MonteCristo I'll absolutely check that out! Thanks for the info!
[2:01:11] RDKi: I imagine that esports will take over traditional sports eventually
[2:01:14] homelander369: Who do you have winning ltr T1 or Hle?
[2:01:26] TheMommik: And you played BL3
[2:01:28] ASquishyLiquid: I didn't say NFL lol
[2:01:29] PKuall4life: did you guys do monty python yet?
[2:01:29] babyzyn: I thought certain esports events already perform better than some  traditional sports
[2:01:33] Zebrios: For an esport to reach traditional sports levels, it'll have to be simple enough that a lay viewer can understand it without having played it.
[2:01:39] ASquishyLiquid: I said "a" traditional sport
[2:01:46] killerwhalekj: this meta is perfect for faker since only azir and corki are being played
[2:01:49] commando1814: the biggest 100 most viewed shows of all time are mostly nfl games it's insane how big the nfl is
[2:01:52] iAteForks: @edenjtv yeah but it's got like 60 years of history almost.  I give it a few years/decades before esports hit that level, but it's probably possible
[2:01:55] ASquishyLiquid: Also more ppl watch world finals than superbowl
[2:01:55] commando1814: in the us
[2:01:56] fatalqwerty: Im tired of being a KT fan, what do I do? FeelsBadMan

[2:02:40] fatalqwerty: I havent watched GEN vs DK yet, if they body DK I'll hop to the GEN bandwagon
[2:02:41] commando1814: space cowboys are fucking cool
[2:02:43] ASquishyLiquid: Superbowl is pretty NA centric
[2:02:43] Noobishwizard: Bepop is great, i like Space Dandy as well
[2:02:44] Amosdragon: Cowboy Bebop is, indeed, amazing
[2:02:44] Attila412: What about Neongenesis Evangelion?
[2:02:48] ASquishyLiquid: Evenskme
[2:02:54] najafan: But Ergo Proxy has heavy references to Gnosticism monte, cmon.

[2:03:29] last_of_scions: code geass has my favourite ending
[2:03:32] yalestream: i have been reading one piece weekly for 20+ years now, so my answer is kinda biased by that
[2:03:35] Sopranou: Damn Monte, haven't watch any LoL content for something like 7 years. You haven't aged at all, looking great!
[2:03:36] ASquishyLiquid: Even something like every time India vs Pakistan play, not even just finals, has more viewers than superbowl
[2:03:36] cloudacmaster: Trigun?
[2:03:37] PathosEngine: You're not casual if you mention Paprika.

[2:04:26] Noobishwizard: Trigen ending half is weird
[2:04:26] redsevn: have you seen the new Trigun?
[2:04:30] commando1814: @iateforks it might be too real man
[2:04:37] kerokerogrips: Monte did you see how ridiculous the game pauses were for the LCS ? Why would anyone watch the live product when game pauses are killing the hype
[2:04:38] PathosEngine: Ugh, now I'm thinking about Perfect Blue again.
[2:04:38] arthradot: i had a teacher you remind me of and the only manga he liked was Vagabond. no anime adaptation however

[2:07:02] commando1814: mushu is also a phenomenal side kick
[2:07:04] ASquishyLiquid: @commando1814 so basically just NA
[2:07:14] oneifbyland: Faker's shockwave is 50% larger
[2:07:14] Zebrios: It's the outer circle
[2:07:17] arthradot: @asquishyliquid direct to dvd sequels a couple years old. and a more recent live action. do not watch lol

[2:07:52] theancientdreamer: when can we give a player the title of lord?
[2:07:59] yalestream: i think Nami is super undervalue'd atm, she is usually just used as Lucians sidekick

[2:09:03] Karego: when he chased bdd under tower
[2:09:21] fatalqwerty: I've always thought, given that you had a somewhat edgy younger days, you would be a fan of Texhnolyze, if you havent watched it it's pretty good.
[2:09:24] benjvmxn: do you want russell to come back next year? @MonteCristo
[2:09:37] Sniper13x: it was earlier than that no?

[2:10:28] Pep_bardiola: @hairykintama that is to be expected
[2:10:39] LuxtheGod: top lane hasnt been shown even once lol

[2:13:00] LightfellowFGC: @najafan Nowhere near in quality
[2:13:01] najafan: Really, I'd just love something to scratch that Baccano itch.
[2:13:04] oneifbyland: @Noobishwizard do you mean Blank? Bengi literally came in to save some of those series...

[2:13:34] Skixxxx: @Noobishwizard bengi is no way in hell fraudulent
[2:13:34] gwaschaos: interesting that guma waited to finish his first full item to buy support item
[2:13:36] najafan: @LightfellowFGC That's a shame. I tried Night Raid 1931, and it was good, but not as good.
[2:13:41] syltv: this game a true banger
[2:14:02] fatalqwerty: I wonder if zeus is gonna get scooped up by a chinese team next year

[2:14:09] najafan: Also seen Banana Fish compared.
[2:14:18] Astrotaur: Beryl had to ult anyways
[2:14:28] Astrotaur: can't risk it
[2:14:44] RDKi: I do think that unless you have hard shoving lanes, the grubs are a bait
[2:15:03] kerokerogrips: chat i didnt see the lec cast today was production scuffed ?
[2:15:13] Pep_bardiola: @kerokerogrips not rly
[2:15:19] Digolift1: Bdd was terrible this series
[2:15:29] Pep_bardiola: horror
[2:15:29] RDKi: the ori rell combo
[2:15:31] yalestream: taking 1 grub is nearly instant if you have a smite charge, i am suprised more junglers dont take a quick 1
[2:15:33] avakan48: Scout+tarzan
[2:15:34] CaptMalReynolds: If the jungler is free and you can get grubs the gold and xp are worth
[2:15:34] QuackTheDuck: doesnt grubs give good exp and gold tho?
[2:15:36] Pep_bardiola: i think the rell speed thingy saved faker
[2:15:40] fatalqwerty: KT is not beating the fraud allegations PepeHands
[2:15:43] BeezyLAN: monte's heart is breaking in real time
[2:15:43] Dreamchosis: rell ms on faker
[2:15:50] Zebrios: -_- BDD face no space
[2:15:59] NIP_R00KIE: can't shuffle faker  on azir
[2:16:07] QuackTheDuck: like I think people underestimate how much exp and gold it gives vs normal camps
[2:16:10] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Oner's speed up literally gets him out
[2:16:12] vvtchcrft777: @MonteCristo I can't tell about the meta just yet, but it still feels like T1 is still OP. Cause Faker gets to coach and play.
[2:16:15] yalestream: he did fine on akali as well, that was just a very hard akali matchup
[2:16:44] LightfellowFGC: Weird that people aren't picking Fiddlesticks, he can 1v2 easily at the Grubs, he gets so much W health from all those targets
[2:17:02] Skixxxx: bdd was fine, faker was just better
[2:17:07] RomanticCreampie: matchup looks kinda hard for azir
[2:17:07] axelerator: KT
[2:17:10] fatalqwerty: @LightfellowFGC he can also do a banger gank on top lane when he reaches 6
[2:17:17] yalestream: fiddlesticks loses to vision control and pro is so much about vision that he suffers
[2:17:18] edgtrv: It's the Faker classic.  Just be better than the other guy.
[2:17:23] axelerator: KT's best player and arguably best mid in LCK rn
[2:17:27] Zebrios: @LightfellowFGC Grabs aren't a high priority objective, and Fiddle kinda sucks in comparison to other JG later.
[2:17:32] sonicboom174: T1 are dominant only when they can camp bot
[2:17:39] killerwhalekj: bdd has one of the most versatile champ pool
[2:17:47] grandezelx: I still dont know why lucian gets through for t1
[2:17:50] Skixxxx: @axelerator BDD is not the best mid in lck rn
[2:17:58] Pep_bardiola: @Zebrios no he doesnt suck later
[2:17:59] Amosdragon: @sonicboom174 Like this game? KEKHeim
[2:18:02] Ligs4prez: I'm pretty sure you could camp Zeus' lane too
[2:18:17] RDKi: they were too scared of Aatrox or something
[2:18:21] GelatoSquid: Zeus' q2 flash was so fucking cracked
[2:18:24] Sjkaev: wow the kt follow up is wow
[2:18:25] mjoll_the_hotness: bdd was on his way winning worlds at 2017 and then ssg happened
[2:18:27] sim337: Grats on your new baby Monte. Best of luck ;)
[2:18:31] yalestream: 10 sec before Blue Aphelios ult coulda followed up ksante
[2:18:36] Urinatingturtle: why are the ads going the suport item? for vision or just gold share again
[2:18:40] avakan48: Aatrox on ult
[2:18:42] fatalqwerty: okay I'll just not watch anymore, wake me up when GEN vs DK start FeelsBadMan
[2:18:42] NIP_R00KIE: that's zeus aatrox
[2:19:06] yalestream: with the aphelios ult that fight is a huge W
[2:19:06] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:19:13] homelander369: Zeus is so clean holy shit
[2:19:21] GelatoSquid: the stutter step q2 flash is undodgeable
[2:19:37] zer088: yea ksante overforced
[2:19:41] BeezyLAN: yes but think of the sirens call of the double W
[2:19:48] LuxtheGod: how does that azir ult not hiot
[2:20:04] RDKi: I kinda think that the xin ult made oner's buffered abilities go off even if oner was clicking away
[2:20:13] RDKi: because otherwise why would Oner randomly go back into the tower
[2:20:22] yalestream: if ksante gets the angle on that ult a bit better that is actually a great engage
[2:20:38] Skixxxx: last fight xin and aphelios got zoned by aatrox, thats why the couldnt follow on perfects play
[2:20:38] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo is pyosik's limit 3 series of playing good and its time to int
[2:21:06] zer088: T1 just too good
[2:21:24] Dim_Mon: How many iterations of KT losing to T1 can there be
[2:21:29] Dim_Mon: The answer is yes
[2:21:31] fatalqwerty: Can KT still get better or is this the limit based on their player specs?
[2:21:43] jimbo002y: perfect for KT then LUL
[2:21:44] AltaDark: it's so weird how they (kt) are behind the play when they were   so ahead in game 1(playing aggressive)
[2:21:44] homelander369: Can T1 golden road this year?
[2:21:47] sjw_tear_eater: pyosht
[2:22:01] l0unes: how can anyone say lck is boring after this game
[2:22:03] yalestream: if PerfecT turns into a top3  player they can
[2:22:05] Astrotaur: @fatalqwerty this is winter, a lot can still happen
[2:22:06] HeySugar: Pyosik coinflips between Insec and IWD
[2:22:10] Im_Rubic: imperfect :nodd
[2:22:12] avakan48: at least KT could go world as 4th seed
[2:22:19] wryjester: By Beryl and Pyosik taking KT to World Champ as KR 4 seed.
[2:22:25] axelerator: would BDD and Deft be willing to play towards top tho?
[2:22:33] LightfellowFGC: Man fuck Ksante
[2:22:46] wigge123: @HeySugar No becouse both Insec and IWD was good.
[2:23:01] Im_Rubic: I loved how they approached this
[2:23:30] Urinatingturtle: jeeeesus
[2:23:34] jimbo002y: everyone exploded
[2:23:46] sim337: yeah when keria and faker are sync it's just disgusting
[2:23:55] Sjkaev: keria casually leveling up from last year
[2:23:57] axelerator: how can Meteos say Lucian isn't OP?
[2:24:03] sneakygoat022: Faker is insane on ori just knows her limit so will
[2:24:03] Im_Rubic: I wish they showed KT's POV there
[2:24:03] l0unes: where did game 1 Berly go
[2:24:14] Skixxxx: @axelerator bc he only watches LCS and lucian is awful in the west

[2:24:39] jimbo002y: deft finally hit an aphelios ult and immediately died LUL
[2:24:51] divine_killjaeden: @axelerator Na Lucian Na jayce are op but only in the lpl and lck.
[2:24:54] Ligs4prez: Is Faker back to preinjury levels?
[2:24:54] RDKi: I'm surprised he built Luden's
[2:24:55] Astrotaur: zeus quietly became a monster in this game
[2:25:06] axelerator: @Skixxxx oh yea didn't even acknowledge LPL or LCK lucians are cracked
[2:25:30] yalestream: Profane Hydra Aatrox tech seems disgusting
[2:25:39] Jaredhtm: Thus series was game was good the rest was boring af
[2:25:45] Jaredhtm: One
[2:26:02] godhead7777: this game is over brother man
[2:26:03] divine_killjaeden: Why orn is so op in Na no one does anything. So teams scales and wins.
[2:26:23] Im_Rubic: Zeus
[2:26:33] Ligs4prez: BDD got exploded
[2:26:36] fatalqwerty: Zeus was megachad right there
[2:26:39] sneakygoat022: Zeus aatrox is just too good
[2:26:52] Skixxxx: those flashes to dodge azir ult pretty good
[2:26:52] jimbo002y: zeus makes aatrox look like faker riven LUL
[2:26:58] caderlee: nice gg
[2:26:59] axelerator: t1 ramping up

[2:27:17] updatefreak: aatrox, that champ solo win 2 worlds in a row
[2:27:30] l0unes: perfect is liability
[2:27:31] axelerator: man it's criminal we might not get to see GenG vs T1 till maybe playoffs
[2:27:31] vvtchcrft777: I remember watching Zeus running it in his first season. Seeing him grow from year 1 is so satisfying as a T1 fan.
[2:27:35] Adanion: RIP my goats
[2:27:54] fatalqwerty: Finally free from pain, let's move on to a better series FeelsGoodMan
[2:27:57] Sjkaev: black & red t1 always looks good
[2:27:58] l0unes: shoemaker my goat
[2:27:58] ggscotty: I don't like the observing style of LCK...why did they follow BDD with the fast zoom in the last fight
[2:28:00] arthradot: showmaker slaps in this first game
[2:28:01] wwinter__: Yeah zeus is my favourite player to watch
[2:28:22] christianclassic1: DK really should have won that series 2-0

[2:31:09] mifot: sylas is also fishing
[2:31:16] arthradot: the first three picks for gen are great sylas ults
[2:31:21] BUBBLESHINOBI: blind sylas but these ults are sooo good on him
[2:31:29] yalestream: varus ult is also busted on Sylas
[2:31:57] fatalqwerty: Olaf just gonna run over these guys

[2:32:03] yalestream: thats a "run down the backline" olaf yea
[2:32:07] updatefreak: haha chovy skill check showmaker
[2:32:33] BUBBLESHINOBI: DK teamcomp is very low dmg tho can that be a problem
[2:32:51] Zoogs: @MonteCristo do you plan on doing live casts of games in the future?
[2:32:53] yalestream: this is a sylas "gank botlane becuase those ults are nice" game
[2:33:02] updatefreak: oh I thought it was akali mid
[2:33:10] edenjtv: Monte what do you think about Gen's player lineup this year?
[2:33:19] Astrotaur: In S13 Sylas was the single highest base hp scaler and base MR scaler (scaling with lvls), isn't that a problem for a midlaner ?
[2:33:50] fatalqwerty: Riot HQ the moment they see Monte co-stream: Shut it down! SwiftRage Shut it down! SwiftRage
[2:34:07] yalestream: when i said "slyas would gank botlane lots" i didnt think about level 1
[2:34:17] Zoogs: @MonteCristo they did you dirty. You are the best in all aspects of lol

[2:35:32] PapaSmithy: ya i go to bed like 1am on average
[2:35:36] Chase5delta: lck is live rn but its drx bro snoozefest
[2:35:39] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo what do you think about the unfair advantage of blue side now. Better access to baronpit mid is safer and bot just sucks for red. Only advantage they have is maybe easier entrance to drake pit
[2:35:45] YaBoyBerry: one of the best lck casters @PapaSmithy
[2:35:45] zionsick: Here is 12:11am Jan 28

[2:35:58] verylingual: cannot wait for you to watch game 2
[2:36:08] yalestream: average olaf gameplay right there
[2:36:25] Astrotaur: @BUBBLESHINOBI blueside advantage in professional is more about pick order than anything
[2:36:45] BUBBLESHINOBI: @BUBBLESHINOBI also that cuz of powerpicks currently being better than counterpicks
[2:37:13] jerckysminion: so what did u think of KC who once again with a way stronger comp lose in ways unimmaginable in anybody's mind
[2:38:12] kerokerogrips: @jerckysminion throw ults to get mid push into get out team fought into drake pit team combo hits hard
[2:38:28] verylingual: monte have you already watched this series or is this your first time seeing it
[2:38:39] aoersie: @jerckysminion Saken > Faker ofc Kappa

[2:40:22] najafan: @playmightymasks ?????
[2:40:28] Astrotaur: banger LCS is almost an oxymoron
[2:40:31] del1nquency: @playmightymasks at least you tried
[2:40:33] najafan: Are you trolling.
[2:41:01] sneakygoat022: chat gets baited so easily
[2:41:10] Astrotaur: @playmightymasks somebody has forgotten to take their meds
[2:41:10] dbird901: yea how do ya'll fall for that? lol
[2:41:34] Zoogs: @MonteCristo You said live without proper permission is illegal but how much removed from "live" can you be?
[2:41:47] Astrotaur: Sylas OP as a concept
[2:41:48] RDKi: I think he is asking whether you'll ever vodcast games like how people used to do
[2:42:14] AzureCatalyst: Does anyone know why they're calling the top teams west side teams versus east side teams being the weaker teams?
[2:42:21] dowiet: good ol kenny rogers

[2:43:15] playmightymasks: @aoersie no chance lol. it will be G2 / BDS or C9
[2:43:18] sneakygoat022: ad breaks too
[2:43:53] Astrotaur: yeah you should only watch live if you're interested in 1 particular match up
[2:44:05] Astrotaur: not watch the whole show
[2:44:05] Sjkaev: ad breaks/game lull/pauses/desk section; thats just toomuch time to spend
[2:44:09] Astrotaur: it's too time consuming
[2:44:17] yalestream: good call on the varus ult, also ashe being close to 6 as well
[2:44:17] Kodord: What was that random ass heal for
[2:44:30] l0unes: this series has pause
[2:44:49] Zoogs: @MonteCristo Respect the decision. Personally, I would prefer you and DOA to cast all games lol

[2:44:56] swayyxo: @AzureCatalyst Because when they show the rankings of all 10 teams, 1 - 5 is on the left (west) side of the screen and 6-10 is on the right (east) side lol
[2:45:10] yalestream: Ksante roaming is just scary

[2:45:45] Kodord: If*
[2:45:49] arthradot: that’s my showmaker
[2:45:59] yalestream: Varus ult is busted on AP
[2:46:04] najafan: CHOVY NO
[2:46:05] AzureCatalyst: This series is a showmaker clinic
[2:46:10] najafan: HOLLOW RADIANCE WHY
[2:46:14] najafan: NOOOO
[2:46:20] Zoogs: @MonteCristo who is your fav person to cast with?
[2:46:23] AzureCatalyst: He shoiulda gone kaenic rookern
[2:46:35] Adanion: Burping babies and watching LoL, things Id never have thought would have gone together LUL
[2:46:40] Astrotaur: Peyz killed back to back
[2:46:40] Dim_Mon: Compared to last year to me it feels like someone at Riot went let's turn the action up to 11
[2:46:48] Astrotaur: this will set him back quite a bit
[2:46:50] Sjkaev: showmaker gotta pop off against canyon
[2:46:59] zen__cloud: @najafan he can clear the wave faster FeelsOkayMan
[2:47:08] AzureCatalyst: I think peyz is pretty much a nonfactor this game after those 2 deaths
[2:47:11] aBitTooHircine: was showmaker chovy ever a 1a 1b for best lck mid, its hard to remember showmakers context after this past year
[2:47:20] yalestream: thats what he gets for picking asn ADC, just like solo q
[2:47:32] najafan: @zen__cloud Rookern would make him impossible to trade with for Sylas
[2:47:49] Astrotaur: yalestream he still has ult
[2:48:18] zen__cloud: @najafan i was memeing, based on the fact that chovy loves csing
[2:48:22] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo DK played this well cuz if they are not ahead early their teamcomp is very low dmg
[2:48:27] Sjkaev: olaf so goddamn scary LUL
[2:49:01] Stuntit: lethality varus and ashes support into olaf doesnt feel very good to play

[2:52:51] Zoogs: @MonteCristo Would I be correct to assume with all these esports orgs there is alot of favoritism over performance/production? I hope that question makes sense.
[2:52:58] ReapersArk: I find grubs to be very overrated do you think its powerful enough?
[2:53:27] DazyLave: that grubby demolish proc and getting 2 plates feels great
[2:54:07] BUBBLESHINOBI: @Paroto7 its mostly fleet for matchups that you dont necessarily win the trades. Conq for comps that have prolonged fighting or hard to oneshot targets and electro for matchups that you have fairly easy burst windows
[2:55:11] Stuntit: lethality varus has to be top 3 most useless champs in the game, just barely beaten by full ap darius and crit yuumi

[2:55:35] RDKi: going with the Olaf over the J4 to counter the immobile ADC's was such a great choice
[2:55:55] WaXMaXter: akali no flash
[2:55:57] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo have you seen malignance karma mid that ult reset bs is gonna be too toxic rn
[2:56:06] Sjkaev: what is this chase LUL
[2:56:47] fokinha92: That could/should be way worse for geng no?
[2:56:52] fokinha92: DK* sorry
[2:57:45] mifot: grub gap
[2:58:03] najafan: @BUBBLESHINOBI Or just send her top and build semi tank after malig?
[2:58:12] Zebrios: Lucid is frontrunner for rookie of the year for me
[2:58:17] najafan: Like old top karma / top morg?
[2:58:38] DazyLave: ive been playing malignance karma. it feels sooo strong
[2:58:59] BUBBLESHINOBI: @BUBBLESHINOBI yeah but ap might be better cuz the ult reset from malignance just gets you R+Q combo in like 3 secs cd which is broken for how much dmg it does and how big of an aoe dmg it is
[2:59:08] edenjtv: I wonder how showmaker and canton feel playing against one another now
[2:59:15] Carbonetics: lichbane sylas? does the on hit work now or just good stat stick?
[2:59:17] edenjtv: canyon*
[2:59:38] Zebrios: Malignance Karma sounds like a Faker pick.
[3:00:22] luxury_ball: @Carbonetics when did the on hit not work?

[3:00:45] fokinha92: Aiming still has that tendency of catching waves that are not safe, huh?
[3:01:19] RDKi: Poke Varus with Hail of Blades :)
[3:01:24] Zelgius: Not been a great week for lethality varus
[3:01:37] CrescentCrest: They should have just collapsed and committed after the Sejuani ult.
[3:01:52] CrescentCrest: Take out 1 or 2 of them and then deal with the rest.
[3:01:53] najafan: @BUBBLESHINOBI Basically comes down to if you want to nuke or if you want to be sticky and annoying, I guess. Constantly applying malignance E would still be awful, right? Or also build iceborn.
[3:02:19] fokinha92: I don't know if you catch that but he lost cleanse in the same manner before the fight
[3:02:45] Zelgius: Dying for lehends' sins
[3:02:51] najafan: Er, Malignance W
[3:04:11] SnowKayn: when will LCK play on a later patch?
[3:04:27] SnowKayn: I hope some of the anti-burst measures riot has taken are implemented soon
[3:04:49] fokinha92: I don't see Gen G being able to fight next drake if they resist the baron push
[3:05:28] epicalbawler: bro drx is hitting hard rn

[3:05:55] fokinha92: I missed the draft but how we got to pick Varus, Ashe and Akali into Olaf, Rell and Sylas?
[3:06:28] Sjkaev: nice draft
[3:07:52] fokinha92: Maybe Ashe/Varus could work if it wasn't lethality varus? But still so fragile into Rakan Olaf Rell
[3:08:00] mifot: why'd they let the maokai in this time?
[3:08:21] androsjg: lucid playing well and a human top laner, DK look solid
[3:08:57] Double_Hitt: Tian played maokai this week
[3:09:35] androsjg: i'd be interested to hear dom;s opinion on kiin udyr

[3:10:56] arthradot: @montecristo does dk going lethality aatrox into 2 tanks + lulu make you think a diff top pick would’ve worked better?
[3:12:16] arthradot: yeah i’m wary of kingen getting his champ pool pushed as time goes on
[3:13:33] LuxtheGod: wow i was having the biggest deja vu watching this, chalked it up to yet another aph/lulu vs lucian nami, then realized i watched this live yesterday lol
[3:13:34] stevethekind: I fell asleep when showmaker locked syndra. glad to see you breaking it down monte
[3:14:06] stevethekind: west coast time zone ceremoStalker
[3:14:22] Carbonetics: im just happy its not azir,corki,ori again
[3:14:43] mifot: i was interested in syndra going the rune that gives you a skill point, and then i remembered they reworked the champion
[3:14:46] najafan: The monkey paw curls.
[3:14:48] najafan: Jayce
[3:15:18] mifot: orb over spiked vest, very nice
[3:15:37] nolliia: so KC lost to rogue also huh

[3:16:55] fokinha92: They play SK today
[3:17:23] arthradot: ^yep
[3:17:29] nolliia: same thing they plays against 1st and 2nd table next so they are fucked
[3:17:32] Phixos2: are you streaming/liveviewing t1 hle? @MonteCristo
[3:17:40] nolliia: pretty much 0-9 secured
[3:17:58] stevethekind: that’s fine. would rather watch the vod tomorrow
[3:18:44] androsjg: geng's macro here is like LS nirvana, they stay in the game so well with objectives
[3:19:00] Sjkaev: i just pray for their souls so tha KC doesnt become the shanghai dragons of lec LUL
[3:19:08] stevethekind: rell isn’t that great at killing the grubs eh
[3:19:28] Zebrios: Showmaker's ult did zero dmg to chovy

[3:21:47] hairykintama: he just need better top
[3:22:04] Zebrios: I think Lucid is a future world champion jungler.  He's got the hands already.
[3:22:04] TheGreatKatzby: kellin KEKW

[3:24:50] PoBeaver: Monte about to hit us with the 3 min ad break
[3:25:09] stevethekind: will we ever get a monte and doa bangers only stream
[3:25:59] RDKi: This whole game is just waiting for Jayce to do damage
[3:26:06] fokinha92: They had the hardest schedule IMO

[3:27:05] cam1452: any nerd culture soon?

[3:27:59] RDKi: It's impossible to get perfect games now because of grubs, this game might be the closest we get for a long time
[3:28:01] VanidarD: ive been watching that blue eyes samurai
[3:28:04] VanidarD: its not bad
[3:28:30] stevethekind: blue eye samurai is insane

[3:32:11] Zelgius: Kiin checking that is so crucial
[3:32:17] fokinha92: I fucking love Kiin damn.
[3:33:35] Zebrios: Peyz
[3:33:37] Zebrios: hit him
[3:33:41] stevethekind: my love for Kiin is overshadowed by my love for showmaker
[3:33:49] VanidarD: ah canyons int
[3:33:58] fokinha92: I mean back in the afreeca days he was the "carry top" by definition, great laning but he became so smart and complete now
[3:34:04] 偽物だ: no more kiin GP tho
[3:34:10] theancientdreamer: @montecristo how the fuck do they lose this game?!
[3:34:12] VanidarD: it honestly, always surprises me, how tanky Rell is
[3:34:29] mifot: peyz can't get in
[3:34:31] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Lucid will have a ring within 3 years.  Quote me.
[3:34:39] stevethekind: holy shit. lucid is insane
[3:35:04] Sjkaev: ohi think i know why
[3:35:08] Civiss: no way he ults aph
[3:35:08] VanidarD: or chovy

[3:35:23] Sjkaev: did one of his dying teammates overlapped?
[3:35:35] arthradot: super hyped for lucid
[3:36:08] schlachserino: Canyon should’ve pushed rell away from team
[3:36:30] fokinha92: Couldn't they simply sac Kiin, burst drake and use maokai ult to disengage? Or still risky because it is a 50-50?

[3:43:02] Civiss: is this what lucian is supposed to dps wise
[3:43:36] Ortopox13: Do you think that Riot will ever change dragons back such that the majority of games don't end into a doomfight at 25-30?
[3:43:37] Zebrios: I think if Aiming just backed and defended, they still might have won it.
[3:43:52] fokinha92: @Ortopox13 No because they love the 25 min games LUL
[3:44:15] fokinha92: They could also be more disciplined and not contest the redside jungle when DK had baron
[3:44:17] Askingformyself: I missed it. was the skt vs KT game good?
[3:44:21] najafan: @fokinha92 They have so many pauses that they need them to be that fast

[3:45:00] stevethekind: peyz is so fucking good
[3:45:01] Zebrios: @Askingformyself Games 2 and 3 were absolute stomps
[3:45:23] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo do you think it's a mistake that for aiming not build quickblades/IE?
[3:45:47] Askingformyself: @zebrios skt won I assume?
[3:46:12] Zelgius: The aatrox TP
[3:46:19] rilsolo: kingen's tp to insta die is great

[4:03:50] Civiss: @Play_Time7 it's maddening to see them do stormrazor/ie/rfc instead of lethality
[4:04:20] stevethekind: wtf is Tristan’s
[4:04:26] stevethekind: tristana
[4:04:41] scratterboon: trist mid looks strong, we should get some of our LEC mids to play it
[4:04:49] stevethekind: oh my god
[4:04:54] Civiss: thankgod the goat tactical knows this and built lethality to give IMTs only win
[4:05:15] godvik22: very dominant on trist even last year
[4:05:22] Play_Time7: @scratterboon pls no they will build static and be useless
[4:05:37] VanidarD: well, doesnt help if LEC mids play it and build static shiv xdd
[4:05:43] makhaonx: Kingen the fraud
[4:06:04] godvik22: thanatos enjoyers laughing rn
[4:06:39] fartnugget45: aiming DansGame
[4:06:58] scratterboon: getting cucked by milio, feels bad man
[4:07:01] Civiss: he went miks first too
[4:07:07] lilsusie: I’m going to get soy garlic wings
[4:07:14] Civiss: like gl locking milio down
[4:07:16] Kodord: o ya
[4:07:19] Kodord: skip ahead
[4:07:19] pentalem: wonder if riot will gut milio eventually this year or if they'll let him be meta for a while
[4:07:20] Kodord: they pause
[4:07:28] Kodord: they chronobreak
[4:07:28] stevethekind: why can you ride inside of herald bro
[4:07:29] Sjkaev: tokyo drift LUL
[4:07:30] Civiss: that not a bug?
[4:07:32] RDKi: Herald has a few bugs with it
[4:07:35] stevethekind: what the fuck game are we playing
[4:07:40] Askingformyself: so….what does team communication sound like after a player realizes he fucked up?
[4:07:41] y0sf: KEKHeim
[4:07:41] Civiss: they remade LOL
[4:07:42] godvik22: bugvy
[4:07:42] Fodonzo: indy game company
[4:07:43] Dragonslave49: is that a bug or what
[4:07:45] stevethekind: RIIIYOOOOT - nemesis
[4:07:45] VanidarD: its a bug, they actually chronobreak it very quickly
[4:07:57] kerokerogrips: has anyone tried to replicate the bug seems like it can be giga in solo queue
[4:08:03] Mizzzraim: surprisingly quick break for lck standards LUL
[4:08:08] najafan: Showmaker is a bad sport.
[4:08:10] HOWYOUSOGOOD: its a "unallowed action" so they had to redo
[4:08:25] BostromTV: why are lck chronobreaks so much smoother/quicker than lcs ones?

[4:08:42] Mizzzraim: @BostromTV usually they are not
[4:08:53] rilsolo: clown car herald lets goo
[4:09:04] scratterboon: how dare you questions riot coding man
[4:09:05] VanidarD: I think Herald actually split, it looked like 2 heralds were charging in the exact same place
[4:09:06] godvik22: carpool karaoke
[4:09:13] Civiss: surely we dont need to cap the damage. never gonna have a bug to let more than one in herald at a time!
[4:09:17] najafan: Which is just bad coding, it should be a boolean
[4:09:19] Zelgius: The 5-man nexus blitz sled int would be great to see in professional
[4:09:23] archerist: i think damage is dealt by the champion rather than the herald itself, so two champions dealing the same damage
[4:09:28] pentalem: Riot: "WRITE THAT DOWN! WRITE THAT DOWN!!!"
[4:09:29] Dragonslave49: get all 5 in and it just goes straight for the nexus
[4:09:46] VanidarD: yeah, thats waht it looked like to me
[4:09:46] Askingformyself: stop questioning riot, you’ll never get to co-stream this way PepeLaugh
[4:09:56] PolyG: not even Riot knows how the code works LuL
[4:10:10] najafan: Well the herald is a minion, soooo
[4:10:11] VanidarD: and Riot probably fired the engineer who wrote the code
