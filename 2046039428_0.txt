[0:00:52] guidoscheide: Hello Ipav!
[0:02:31] Asheetomalph: 11th
[0:03:12] scoutsgamediary: !followage
[0:04:27] byhergrace: hi beautiful people peepoComfy
[0:05:57] byhergrace: no challenger D:
[0:06:49] Asheetomalph: can you check japanese server? they got some spicy players
[0:07:26] byhergrace: His team keep letting him down :(
[0:07:55] byhergrace: What about classic Tank-mo at the sacrifice to damage?
[0:08:55] byhergrace: Ohhh Pog
[0:09:58] byhergrace: Ah,  makes sense..
[0:10:50] quickfuk: I only pick them for counter matchups (trundle, Warwick, Jax, and garen). Mid game is so unfun if the mid lane is ahead
[0:12:46] byhergrace: but is there a sure fire to know wherever the Teemo will trap? Hmm
[0:14:04] Asheetomalph: Why do you like to play teemo
[0:14:04] Gaarp64: dark harvest teemo :D
[0:14:59] Gaarp64: why are people not buying nashors anymore?
[0:15:15] galaapples1: He played teemo also when he was lower elo
[0:15:21] galaapples1: When he got higher he stopped
[0:16:18] Asheetomalph: BibleThump
[0:16:37] pr0mii: Hello :)
[0:16:57] byhergrace: is lethiality teemo a no-no?
[0:17:48] byhergrace: I'm curious from your point of view does lethiality benefit him?
[0:17:51] Asheetomalph: i miss tankmo with frozen mallet
[0:17:52] Gaarp64: @ipav999 why are people not buying nashors anymore?
[0:18:03] Asheetomalph: and grasp
[0:18:21] byhergrace: Good luck for game :)

[0:19:57] Sacred78: would you rather grubs or drag?
[0:20:24] kebapseverim4: kebapseverim4 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak! hiya sir
[0:23:11] byhergrace: wp damn, that calm movement.
[0:25:00] MellonFarm: its not optimal for riot to have ranked games going 30/40min, cause loosing those kinda games is just not fun 99% of the time
[0:25:25] roe_jogan_: would it make sense to max Q against camil?
[0:26:26] MellonFarm: i would honestly prefare games always being around 30 min max
[0:26:30] Asheetomalph: why not using skin
[0:26:49] MellonFarm: anything above that feels like a slug
[0:27:19] Redasaurus: @Asheetomalph cause he gave his skin to your momma ;) j/k
[0:28:53] byhergrace: #worth
[0:29:02] ayoungfung: longer games means more top laners have more impact too
[0:30:30] byhergrace: LUL
[0:31:01] negraodaniel: are you playing ranked?
[0:31:02] ayoungfung: chad normals enjoyer
[0:31:29] Archathens: hello is this League of Legends?   Kappa
[0:31:33] spofy66: why not ranking LUL
[0:32:32] spofy66: 6 = live on the street :D
[0:34:46] byhergrace: Maybe you need more a challenge like first rank 1 to Teemo?... but the downside of that is once you reach rank 1, the only next best rank is 2.
[0:34:50] negraodaniel: dont you enjoy the challenge of the ranked? i feel like when i play normal game nobody gives a fuck after going 0/3 in lane
[0:34:52] booostedhh: Then what is elo of enemy in Normal game?
[0:34:56] rulaxxx500alv: Cheer44 Is the ap build better than the tank build this season?
[0:37:16] Dazzelem: I feel like normal games are even more boring due to massive differences in matchmaking skill between players
[0:37:17] GreatFaery: have you tried quickplay?
[0:38:38] razer_mon: MONKAAAA
[0:39:10] negraodaniel: well, I like to try until the end, and when its not ranked I dont have the will to come back or go into the end (personal feeling), and I feel many of my teans dont try too
[0:39:36] Dazzelem: idk I play a fair amount of normal games myself and when games last that long it’s usually just because my teammates don’t know how to close out a game because they’re like silver and gold
[0:39:48] Dazzelem: but your games might be different
[0:40:19] negraodaniel: I like playing normals with my friends who are learing the game, or when i'm trying new champs, and i have fun
[0:40:33] SanderAntreas: people dont commit their full effort in normals compared to ranked, thats about all the difference, mmr doesnt matter
[0:41:21] razer_mon: tel em
[0:41:53] nosysanta: Do u still build Nashor first item for Teemo or smth else?
[0:41:53] Archathens: Ipav with your chinese skills can  you read Cait's name?
[0:42:03] Archathens: nvm LUL
[0:42:51] razer_mon: yes
[0:43:06] razer_mon: KEKL
[0:43:19] Obile: Oh wow thats why my mmr is strange since inplay normals with my master ranked friends but am Platin but get realy good enemys xD
[0:43:34] spofy66: his ramping KEKW
[0:43:54] razer_mon: all the new players go to ranks to play the game
[0:43:59] razer_mon: not in draft anymore
[0:44:03] razer_mon: they think they hard
[0:44:13] Dazzelem: it sounds like you don’t enjoy league right now.  do the teemo nerfs have something to do with it?
[0:44:24] ayoungfung: so whats the difference between ranked and normal games?
[0:44:26] SanderAntreas: I balieve majority of people care more about putting effort in ranked games, rather than normal games. Also "low rank" as you say - is 90% of the population, so any observation you pull up about your environment doesnt apply to majority
[0:44:27] razer_mon: @Dazzelem KEKW
[0:45:43] SanderAntreas: okay but can you not put words in my mouth
[0:45:48] SanderAntreas: i didnt say anything about losing
[0:46:50] byhergrace: you do worse in try hard because you play out of anger or passion for example and involve your emotions so you over compensate for example on a skill shot
[0:46:56] exdeekaz: they don’t have smite lmao
[0:47:03] Obile: But when U tryhard you lesen better i think
[0:47:11] Obile: Learn
[0:47:15] SanderAntreas: you're wrong :^)
[0:47:27] spofy66: YEP
[0:47:42] razer_mon: TELL EM
[0:47:56] SanderAntreas: I find fun in chilling with my friends in normals with voice chat. No matter win or loss
[0:48:04] league_of_legendss13: <3 LuvCool
[0:48:27] Dazzelem: well I’m master and when I play normals it’s usually so I can play with my irl low elo friends so I just learn new champs or something, and I do care less cuz there’s no harm in losing.
[0:48:29] serrolo: i play to have fun, not winning. but 99% of the times only have fun when winning
[0:48:30] spofy66: Ripge
[0:48:37] razer_mon: wait i just played with this guy
[0:48:58] franko420_: KEKW
[0:49:00] SanderAntreas: ipav lacks casual mindset point of view, its okay
[0:49:21] spofy66: kinda worth :D
[0:49:37] ChichiMG: wtf was that flash
[0:50:12] negraodaniel: double top no jg, gues normals and ranked are the same :D
[0:50:30] ayoungfung: fun top lane gameplay
[0:51:22] SickofGaming: Dumb question, why are there 2 top?
[0:51:37] kBr0ne: kBr0ne subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:51:49] spofy66: KEKW
[0:52:13] pedronergames: imagine a jungler
[0:52:18] spofy66: they are not that smart by the look at things
[0:52:20] ayoungfung: at least 2? you can kill 3 easily
[0:53:49] spofy66: at least its not boring game...thats for sure
[0:56:05] ChichiMG: loooool
[0:56:21] spofy66: Jebaited
[0:56:35] franko420_: KEKW
[0:57:57] ssensuousness: What a fun game
[0:58:36] byhergrace: Shaco actually thought he stood a chance KEKW
[0:59:40] spofy66: caith wont die''' for sure'' KEKW
[0:59:49] qoqotik: 3top what a party
[1:00:16] spofy66: what a fiesta.... love it YEP

[2:52:22] Tiplik1: And malignance worth to build on that mmr?
[2:55:20] FarThought: would your jungle player have gotten mad if you just killed those wolves?
[2:56:54] FarThought: why number 999?
[2:57:30] koizcoli: its better to give those wolves to someone that matters. Like teemo or mf. THis talon dont need them looking how he plays
[2:59:10] richieecoool: bb teemo LUL
[2:59:58] Aaronc123425: The heck did teemo do lol
[3:00:05] hero___san: the new bg music is so annoying

[3:01:55] FarThought: Funny how when your team is dooming, someone on the other team is just as deep despair
[3:01:58] Aaronc123425: I feel like  it only works in a fun game, otherwise I can see it being frustrating
[3:02:09] Remotehead: I take it you changed your mind on full AP / Dark Harvest Teemo?
[3:02:15] Remotehead: or are you testing this build out?
[3:02:46] mklarnecistka: are you going mejaja?
[3:02:47] Tiplik1: Is it worth to swap boots for lichbane or cosmic on endgame?
[3:03:27] Remotehead: she might have TP'd
[3:03:29] ragingpangolin: Is the mushroom build still worth it after the nerf though?
[3:03:41] richieecoool: stormsurge at the end right ?
[3:04:47] richieecoool: @ragingpangolin if the whole team have sweepers gona be useless
[3:06:08] Spegge: talk nicely to them, melt their heart instead
[3:06:14] Spegge: maybe theres no reason to fight
[3:06:26] Tiplik1: Is it worth to swap boots for lichbane or cosmic on endgame?
[3:07:34] Tiplik1: Also gp had perfect stats
[3:08:09] FarThought: soaked up 319 cs
[3:08:14] paladin109: what is ur go to ban?
[3:08:42] Remotehead: No he got buffed last patch
[3:08:44] Tiplik1: I hate mordekaiser over everyone

[3:11:48] Remotehead: I find the hardest thing to deal with is being camped whilst your jungler afk farms.
[3:12:18] ashdeath: @ipav999 do you enjoy more playing teemo tank or ad
[3:13:08] Tiplik1: Ap shroom build
[3:13:55] trombonator420: @ipav999 i was thinking about going rift 3rd after nash and liandries vs particularly tanky teams
[3:14:25] trombonator420: who is tyg?
[3:14:49] trombonator420: ah yung fappy, dont watch him
[3:15:27] Trevichko11: !build
[3:16:09] trombonator420: @ipav999 but why not buy rylai and cosmic instead of just stacking guises?
[3:16:27] Tiplik1: Isnt worth to change one mask for rabadon?
[3:16:50] i_pariston: why you went to nashor’s if you have burst runes
[3:17:44] trombonator420: @ipav999 rift is giving AP for Hp so thats probably why
[3:18:24] trombonator420: ah, its not unique, lol wtf
[3:18:49] trombonator420: it should be unique, every effect like that is unique usually LUL
[3:18:52] Tiplik1: Its stupid going for huntings masks while you go for duel runes, i would rather go for botrk etc.
[3:18:56] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[3:20:04] trombonator420: @Tiplik1 and rift is 10%
[3:20:16] trombonator420: oh sry for the @
[3:21:17] trombonator420: @ipav999 and rift is 10% by itself
[3:21:52] Tiplik1: Play teemo adc
[3:22:04] Tiplik1: I use to, people hate blind on bot
[3:22:40] trombonator420: so its like 33% increase to damage after 5 secs
[3:23:03] ninjadavee: I miss frozen mallet tankmo
[3:23:06] ninjadavee: so fun
[3:24:31] i_pariston: Is these champions op? mordkasier turndle jax
[3:24:36] i_pariston: are****
[3:24:44] trombonator420: its good if you are ahead vs squishy?
[3:25:08] trombonator420: i mean its 30 magic pen with shadow flame and boots
[3:28:17] Gaarp64: u made a mistake with liandris
[3:28:22] Gaarp64: u didnt count in the passive
[3:28:48] Gaarp64: the increased damage over time
[3:29:18] Tiplik1: Malignance over liandrys?
[3:29:20] brid96: depends how tanky is enemy
[3:29:44] scamandar: the trap didnt trigger on the first one. Its not 348
[3:29:56] trombonator420: they are standing still, its not realistic
[3:30:14] trombonator420: for malignance
[3:30:48] trombonator420: @ipav999 not testing with boots?
[3:31:42] haraziiiyt: which champ is better sett or kled
[3:32:54] Tiplik1: D cap better bcs you never build it ss first item
[3:33:03] haraziiiyt: which champ is better sett or kled
[3:33:44] trombonator420: aqa shroom?
[3:33:57] farrkek: ey qü eyy
[3:33:59] farrkek: ey ey ey ey
[3:34:12] farrkek: aga
[3:34:31] trombonator420: 7
[3:34:39] scamandar: 7
[3:34:57] trombonator420: @ipav999 you wrote 7 a's LUL
[3:35:45] farrkek: 26+5=?
[3:35:59] trombonator420: whats nine plus ten
[3:36:33] farrkek: my question is more important
[3:37:00] brid96: but wait , you are not testing on each different enemy every option of combos u make there
[3:37:17] trombonator420: @brid96 these combos are specific to the targets
[3:37:27] razer_mon: 10 hours practice tool PopCorn
[3:37:33] razer_mon: NODDERS
[3:37:50] razer_mon: PopCorn TeaTime
[3:38:42] brid96: @trombonator420 but that is not so comparable than , he should test same combos on all diff, types of tanks imo
[3:40:05] spidiofficial: ipavPog
[3:40:06] trombonator420: @brid96 these are not different types of tanks, these are squishy, bruiser and tank, i guess the rational is that you are gonna have different time to attack these guys so he is testing the most realistic scenarios for each
[3:40:40] brid96: ok idk
[3:41:14] trombonator420: with a squishy like an assassin or adc you are probably have very little time to damage them, so its just aQa
[3:41:52] trombonator420: and tanks usually dont burst you down and cant really run away so you are going to fight them for longer, therefore 8 autos
[3:42:38] trombonator420: @ipav999 i mean shadowflame shines as second onyl with sorcs probably?
[3:46:38] brid96: on low health targets
[3:48:59] trombonator420: @ipav999 but first points of resistance are the most valuable so if you are ignoring 30 instead of just 12 or just 18 at low MR it would be a signifficant difference probably?
[3:50:12] Mental_AlchemistEU: @trombonator420 Every point of resistance works the same, at least if it remained unchanged since 4y
[3:50:14] trombonator420: @ipav999 SF is 12pen, sorcs is 18pen, together its 30 flat pen
[3:51:21] trombonator420: @ipav999 so if its low mr if you ignore most of it you deal almost pure damage
[3:52:13] trombonator420: @ipav999 ok let me go and check the exact % from the resistances
[3:54:00] trombonator420: i was talking specifically about shadowflame being an early buy, before people can buy lots of mr
[3:55:25] Bmpayne: i dont understand why it doesnt recommend building malignance but it says to build rylai's
[3:55:41] Bmpayne: when rylais is str8 trash on teemo
[3:56:41] Greenotter96: hello
[3:56:42] brid96: but u get other stats with those items that maybe make it easier to deal the damage
[3:57:01] trombonator420: @ipav999 so i checked exact values -  60mr is 38%, if you have just SF its 48mr=32%, only sorcs its 42mr=30%, and if you have both its 30mr=23% damage mitigation
[3:59:46] trombonator420: so going from 60 to 30 is 15% damage increase, if they have lower mr, like 40mr=29% it will reduce it to just 10mr=9% damage mitigation @ipav999
[4:00:06] trombonator420: thats already 20% difference
[4:00:47] trombonator420: so having more magic pen is more effective vs lower mr
[4:03:59] trombonator420: yes
[4:04:02] theshadowninja89: Yee
[4:04:29] theshadowninja89: Damn on NA u have high ping
[4:04:29] trombonator420: i was talking more about its effectivness vs squishy chaps as an early buy
[4:04:34] theshadowninja89: I have 40 ms on EUW
[4:05:05] theshadowninja89: Wow where are you from? @dark_m0
[4:05:25] theshadowninja89: I am trying to go below 40 ms
[4:05:41] brid96: @Dark_M0 mediterian sea diff
[4:05:45] theshadowninja89: @dark_m0 If you go outside of pyramide ping should be lower LUL
[4:05:47] theshadowninja89: 😭
[4:05:58] oliasticlol: Have you tested the haunting guise stacking?
[4:06:38] theshadowninja89: How many AP that build?
[4:06:42] theshadowninja89: Buy elixir
[4:06:49] theshadowninja89: Increasing AP
[4:07:15] theshadowninja89: Yeah but this is not about the damage u need some tankiness
[4:07:29] theshadowninja89: @ipav999 Is Riftmaker good on Teemo this season?
[4:07:48] theshadowninja89: Against all-in champs
[4:07:48] brid96: wait is there server for african continent ?
[4:08:15] trombonator420: @theshadowninja89 some players use it, but usualy like a 3rd item buy to stack the damage increase passives
[4:08:25] theshadowninja89: Instead of Zhonya u can go with movement speed @ipav999
[4:08:34] theshadowninja89: Instead of pressing Zhonya u will run away
[4:08:42] theshadowninja89: On your W
[4:08:53] jujutsu2022: bom dia
[4:09:02] 514484: cosmic makes you pretty fast
[4:09:13] theshadowninja89: Do u like CDR boots instead of Sorcery to spam more shrooms?
[4:09:47] jerrykremi: but we're the swift scout :(
[4:09:50] theshadowninja89: Depends on matchups not in every game is Zed in enemy @ipav999
[4:10:25] theshadowninja89: Teemo don't have problems with mana when making lost chapter
[4:10:52] kanellis_EUW: it was just screen of 15 0 teemo game ;)
[4:11:21] theshadowninja89: In my opinion Liandry's Torment should have lost chapter + health
[4:11:39] theshadowninja89: But to balance the item they can lower the health to 200
[4:13:14] ninjadavee: some matchups  we can  not even get a kill LUL
[4:14:13] trombonator420: does it still work with sundered sky? @Dark_M0
[4:14:13] theshadowninja89: Nashor + Liandry + cosmic drive + cdr boots + Rabadon's Hat? @ipav999
[4:14:21] theshadowninja89: What do you think?
[4:15:10] ninjadavee: iam  going for  liandry +riftmaker
[4:15:34] theshadowninja89: To get CDR and MS @ipav999
[4:15:46] theshadowninja89: I wanna spam shrooms all over the map LUL
[4:17:06] theshadowninja89: Ok then Nashor + CDR boots + Malignance + Warmog
[4:17:31] theshadowninja89: And Liandry's
[4:18:14] theshadowninja89: If u have Warmog u can make like Shadowflame because u can wait on passive to heal yourself
[4:18:21] theshadowninja89: And some magic pen is good
[4:18:28] theshadowninja89: In late game agaisnt ADC

[4:21:04] theshadowninja89: @cuscus9214 In Aram Dark Harvest is better
