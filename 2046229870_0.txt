[0:59:22] GhostSham: How do you miss root as Swain? XDD
[0:59:41] getsometalentloser: thats the best shaco o nthe serevr as well @Santorin
[0:59:44] gymleaderjusten: does anyone know when arenas is coming back?
[0:59:54] shadow7master: how shen feels i missed that champ
[1:00:20] Fang2471: @shadow7master 3:11 clear speed
[1:00:24] bucis39: I had good jungler ( he played Belveth) but how can he carry 1v9
[1:00:32] Caendred: @santorin tbh her clear speed went from being absurd to just fast. New shadowflame is very fun on her tho
[1:01:11] GhostSham: If @Santorin is your jg, there is always a can win angle
[1:01:15] shadow7master: @shadow7master so he is good?
[1:01:15] macywaky: whats the best build on belveth?
[1:01:33] Morderator: do a poppy game?
[1:01:42] Offsette7: im struggling a lot on ganking! or enemy just walk off or my team dont follow and i die then i  lose a lot of farm
[1:01:49] Caendred: @santorin new shadowflame Crits spells on low hp, and the crit is doubled on DoT damage. Actual bonkers on brand
[1:01:50] Iratv1: @Santorin trying sky Rek'sai ?
[1:01:52] macywaky: new shadowflame crits dmg i think below 35% hp
[1:01:59] macywaky: all magic dmg and true dmg crit
[1:02:29] bucis39: What do u think is best ADC in emerald+ to carry ? MF, Lucian ?
[1:02:32] Caendred: I'm a big shen jungle champ, he's alright
[1:02:34] shadow7master: yep shadow busted
[1:02:38] Caendred: @santorin new shadowflame Crits spells on low hp, and the crit is doubled on DoT damage. Actual bonkers on brand
[1:02:54] shadow7master: river shen days was great
[1:03:01] Caendred: Bonkers on Lillia as well

[1:14:02] shadow7master: ricky is getting a buff
[1:16:50] lewhitehd69: EZ gold
[1:17:43] Kimakaze: how do you feel about that tank item that does magic dmg and heals you every few seconds? @santorin
[1:18:43] lewhitehd69: unending despair?
[1:18:51] Kimakaze: yeah
[1:18:56] Kimakaze: unending despair
[1:19:02] shadow7master: udyr yorick illaoi buff next patch
[1:19:06] Kimakaze: I’ve seen some other challenger players build it on Lilia
[1:19:16] macywaky: rift maker is omnivamp
[1:19:41] macywaky: i dont think its that good. mambe like and last tiem with resists
[1:19:47] macywaky: maybe*
[1:20:18] Kimakaze: but it was also in the beginning so they may have stopped as well
[1:22:53] Hyuee1: so happy to see lilia being played again this patch, last time i enjoyed playing her when runic echoes was still a thing
[1:23:59] UtterlyGlad: @shadow7master why tf is your getting buffed
[1:24:14] UtterlyGlad: Udyr
[1:24:35] shadow7master: idk man they said he is weak
[1:24:38] Ctrlaltleet: 4Head
[1:25:57] UtterlyGlad: That's so cringe.
[1:26:11] UtterlyGlad: Unless they're nerfing top and buffing jg
[1:26:21] NoVittuZiis: Thats not cringe
[1:26:40] GhostSham: look at viegos items @Santorin  LOL
[1:26:47] shadow7master: @UtterlyGlad they r nerfing buiser items
[1:27:19] UtterlyGlad: Oooh ok. Well they do need nerfs
[1:27:49] UtterlyGlad: Ty Shadow
[1:28:13] Kimakaze: sejuani game maybe? :)
[1:28:16] shadow7master: np
[1:28:19] GhostSham: He changed them, he had Trailblazer and Celestial Opportunity at one point
[1:28:29] GhostSham: ohh
[1:28:33] GhostSham: yeah mb
[1:34:53] Motivhate: o7
[1:37:18] TimeWizardLuL: what do you do in this game?
[1:38:12] d1a_lol: is it worth getting in your opinion?
[1:38:25] colc23: @nintendo chill he meant capture pal's dont sue him
[1:39:49] d1a_lol: Leetorin PogU
[1:40:14] dragontroopbeta2: Pogchair
[1:40:18] Kimakaze: play the ice pig!! :)
[1:40:37] TimeWizardLuL: in this game ur team is ur pokemons too?
[1:41:10] getsometalentloser: ew nonce varus top player
[1:41:23] dragontroopbeta2: Played with this GM ranked 220 the other day who claimed to be a coach for C9 called Galaxy. Bro was hella boosted and lying lmao.
[1:41:35] Kimakaze: sejuani!
[1:42:51] so_dago23: tk top is a thing again?
[1:42:58] mythicalord1: is it still worth it to go eclipse when it doesnt give lethality anymore?
[1:43:07] dragontroopbeta2: Bro was rank 220 but doesn't know what Experimental Hexplate does RIP
[1:43:58] Ancarage: lee singer Pog
[1:44:05] mythicalord1: I think TK top is a thing again, hes a really strong tank
[1:44:29] Ancarage: high give Pog
[1:44:43] iampilgrim23: weird
[1:45:14] Ancarage: speaking of top lane
[1:45:23] Ancarage: top lane island is a lot more lane domination after the map change
[1:45:44] Ancarage: i m just seeing whatever ppl fancy to play and can win lane right now Clueless
[1:45:48] Kimakaze: I can’t get out of emerald playing assassins, my brain can’t understand their playstyle. my playstyle more fits tanks, so I’m gonna swap to sejuani
[1:46:10] Kimakaze: cause I like just going into the middle of fights and getting spicy
[1:46:23] lewhitehd69: ff ratirlOpen
[1:46:30] kalopsia512: and the flash KEKW
[1:46:58] lewhitehd69: clean tahm EZ
[1:47:07] castlemt: Glad you are streaming now!
[1:47:45] kalopsia512: uh
[1:47:52] mythicalord1: does Kindred have any control where the mark goes?
[1:48:08] dragontroopbeta2: Kindred can pick champions but not jungle camps.
[1:48:17] dragontroopbeta2: Each champ has a 5 min cooldown, iirc.
[1:48:31] kalopsia512: another AI game?
[1:48:32] Ancarage: the good news is we got a high five for good vibe
[1:49:49] kalopsia512: bot lane forgot they had a mini map
[1:50:15] mythicalord1: ahhhh the scuttle eats fruit now! I love it lol
[1:52:17] kalopsia512: none of them know that the game comes with a map
[1:53:32] colc23: What skin is that??
[1:53:50] mythicalord1: @colc23 Storm Dragon
[1:54:18] colc23: @mythicalord1 that E animation looks dope
[1:55:32] crecentbear: that was free as shit if he tped omg
[1:55:39] dragontroopbeta2: God Fist is still my fav because of the voice but Storm Dragon hella cool looking.
[1:55:51] Dezrunner: Waaaahaaaaay Nisse-in-the-bush! God søndag =)
[2:00:25] dragontroopbeta2: Been watching LCS so far?
[2:01:19] dragontroopbeta2: IDK, Fly looks just as clean, just needs more early game control over bot.
[2:01:29] xLippyy: howdy gamer
[2:02:41] dragontroopbeta2: Blaber was saying the egos are clashing off screen a bit, as with most superteams. Compared it to playoffs last year in a travis Gafford interview where they skill gapped regular season but lost in Bo5 against NRG.
[2:04:36] Ammst4r: So its just sunderer first item on bruiser such ass Lee, Xin, Wuk? @Santorin
[2:05:17] dragontroopbeta2: I think Inspired plays around Bwipo and its working for them. Just won't working against C9 next week.
[2:10:11] crecentbear: WHAT A CARRY
[2:10:23] dragontroopbeta2: Your team seems fine to me, what's the problem? Kappa
[2:11:49] PREFONTAlNE: @santorin why are some champs meta in pro play but not solo queue? like sejuani and rell jungle?
[2:11:55] dragontroopbeta2: I like when I get autofileld top, pick Malph, tell my jg to stay away until 6 and he gives Jayce first blood while I'm backing.
[2:11:56] ucandoit69: always blame the jungler santorinLUL
[2:12:09] Kimakaze: your wife has more viewers than you, we need to fix that sir
[2:13:30] ucandoit69: LUL
[2:14:01] jblol94: you should duo co stream LEC with broxah!
[2:14:23] Kimakaze: ice pig game? lol
[2:14:25] Ancarage: i think the new map rewards laners that actually pay attention to jg gank timing more now
[2:14:33] Ancarage: probably a good thing honestly
[2:14:39] PREFONTAlNE: is that why nocturne sometimes build tank items in pro play? I will say though that I built hexplate, frozen heart, and jak’sho and dominated. is that also related to jungle just being overall weak or are tank junglers just better right now? sorry for all the questions. I just truly want to get better.
[2:14:41] solidussovis: solidussovis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Yesterday I turned 40. I'm happi3r about my 11 months haha

[2:15:32] Kimakaze: @solidussovis happy birthday!!
[2:15:37] solidussovis: Thank you. It was good. I appreciate the Danish bday wishes
[2:15:42] ucandoit69: no one does it like the rat king xdd
[2:16:05] pepperonireformed: if I am a main lilia what other champ would you recommend playing since shes getting perma banned ? thanks love the stream
[2:16:11] Kimakaze: @solidussovis glad to see another old guy. I’ll be 33 in a couple weeks
[2:17:14] getsometalentloser: the best bit of being an ivern and bel vewth player mainly the first one  how much ppl despise ivern
[2:17:14] PREFONTAlNE: well I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. I love your streams and have learned a lot. again, sorry for all the chatting. haha

[2:18:51] solidussovis: Hecarim is the closest I think you were right therr
[2:19:08] Ancarage: the in and out play style of lilia is very different
[2:19:30] Caendred: Played fiddle with the new walls and he feels horrible
[2:19:35] jblol94: udyr power clear ?
[2:19:39] duke_of_dairy: ekko has a similar hit and run style
[2:19:44] Kimakaze: reksai?
[2:19:44] Ancarage: look at that lilia stat PepeLaugh
[2:20:42] getsometalentloser: @Santorin what champ has the same level as degerancy as ivern i dont want ppl having fun
[2:20:52] solidussovis: Is it racist to say Hec and Illiaare the same?
[2:20:56] rrribas: Nidalee @Santorin
[2:21:00] duke_of_dairy: unrelated, but what do you think about talon jg?
[2:21:11] PREFONTAlNE: let’s get some Bel’veth actions going prefonEZ
[2:21:21] Ancarage: time to be a mad lad and get liandra rift and just run it Kappa

[2:21:30] Ancarage: surely that is close to lilia right? Kappa
[2:21:41] PREFONTAlNE: lillia is a deer lmao

[2:23:53] Ancarage: and zombie brand skin is the one
[2:24:00] Ancarage: the walk is too funny
[2:24:09] PREFONTAlNE: is it okay to not play junglers based on thinking they are absolutely boring to play? like J4 and Gragas
[2:24:26] Iratv1: serves you right! :D
[2:25:08] Ancarage: yea i think so too, as long as u have the right expectation of the champion you are playing
[2:25:13] Ancarage: you will enjoy the game more
[2:25:16] Dezrunner: hey man, i jungled Amumu 2 days ago!
[2:25:21] ucandoit69: thats so true, I tilt way less on champs I really enjoy
[2:25:27] Dezrunner: So no-one ain't right :P
[2:25:48] Breadknife_: that change a bit
[2:27:04] fightb4udie: you seem to have so much energy lol, u have an idea as to how u do
[2:28:18] Dezrunner: The sound of Santorin having an aneurism :P
[2:28:41] johnnnyxdxd: you played that so clean too. that flash on point
[2:28:43] Boh14: TL vs FlyQ game was a banger. What did you think?
[2:30:47] Boh14: Jensen on Ori just hits different
[2:31:00] sebastianminiatures: As a TL fan I didn't even want to watch the game after I saw draft :p
[2:31:48] Kimakaze: so the players not have a say so in their draft? @santorin. I’m not even challenger and I could have picked a better comp I feel
[2:35:14] 777raw777: Brand is freelo
[2:36:21] sebastianminiatures: Santorin is freelo
[2:36:31] 777raw777: What do u think about Lee sin now days?
[2:40:17] zepkron07: what jungler do you think has the most 1v9 carry potential to one trick
[2:40:46] zepkron07: ok
[2:40:49] zepkron07: thx
[2:40:59] 777raw777: Lilia worse than brand since u need to be melee and many things one shot you
[2:43:53] sebastianminiatures: Lucian accurate summoner name
[2:44:18] 777raw777: I like Lilia too just hard cc or assassins like rengar are annoying to play against
[2:44:30] droopti: ill; never forget this sing from cod black ops one the reading into the actual history of the song
[2:45:52] droopti: santorin you need to make a smurf called santorini

[2:47:46] 777raw777: What's your core build on Lilia?
[2:48:42] 777raw777: Also senna is so unhealthy for the game

[3:05:08] potahto: the bars being so fat makes it so much more difficult

[3:05:38] sebastianminiatures: Magnus hasn't even taken his shirt off, he's still goofin
[3:05:56] Zeiik101: this guy being able to keep up with magnus though is impressive

[3:09:36] TimeWizardLuL: do you play eve?
[3:10:12] Ancarage: they have a lower skill floor
[3:10:14] sebastianminiatures: R flash feels so good on amumu
[3:10:30] Ancarage: there is still mastery, but skill floor to start off on the champion is lower
[3:10:49] getsometalentloser: maokai has a 55% wr in support role in masters
[3:10:56] Bradabing: flash R then "wheres my team?" lol
