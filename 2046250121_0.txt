[0:44:34] Smoothcollie: @redtauro U need to read like 10 paragraphs to know this kaypWHAT
[0:44:43] jimbob_ywert: Ornn is good
[0:44:43] littlejellyfishy: @redtauro They all have different abilities and combos to deal a lot of damage
[0:44:47] mrshibasan: Just watching your older videos I love ronin and luna interrupting your games
[0:44:49] CynicalScrub: olaf

[0:45:10] NickRSA: purple hulk is just annoying tho LUL
[0:45:12] oatsie__: i always play gwen into mundo and it 9/10 times goes in my favor
[0:45:13] jimbob_ywert: Shen and tank kench HUGE counters to Munro
[0:45:16] jimbob_ywert: mundo*
[0:45:20] exorc157: fiora and her max health true damage are scary against Mundo. I think Gwen is decent too
[0:45:21] georgo__: Ksante
[0:45:26] jeroenvijver: i still had fun wwatchinn
[0:45:26] TomNova: trundle or TK mayb e
[0:45:38] CynicalScrub: i think olaf, trundle and tahm are all good vs mundo
[0:45:39] redtauro: @littlejellyfishy is it ideal to plan around the order of them when the team fights approach? Like does it make you a better Aphelios to manage them properly or they are just all nice?
[0:45:43] jackson_111111: I think Camille
[0:45:52] littlejellyfishy: Hopefully, you can bop some kids
[0:45:54] fluffycloudlove: best counters for mundo is kled, Zac Warwick bathe Morde

[0:46:03] NickRSA: your teddybear is moving on the couch
[0:46:06] jimbob_ywert: Shen is a pretty easy and strong pickup, I’d recommend him in ur top champ pool
[0:46:10] mistermurr: Vel'coz probably
[0:46:16] Smoothcollie: @redtauro There is no simple question. Longer range, healing, root and...the last one I don't know even, the closer u are the quicker u are. But since all his kit is based on this, u truly need to read thru it all
[0:46:16] drtymike310: 10/10 pupper cam
[0:46:18] Lauraa234: voleLOVE /
[0:46:21] fluffycloudlove: morde is in top 7 counters
[0:46:25] Smoothcollie: @redtauro Answer*
[0:46:27] inSINwetrust: Illaoi, Trynd
[0:46:31] littlejellyfishy: @redtauro Managing them properly is the trickiest part of Aphelios and when you learn to do it properly you can return a whole fight with him
[0:46:38] Hottentott7: @kaypea Hey! How you doing? :)
[0:46:40] georgo__: you can pop it with liandry
[0:46:42] TomNova: i think you played it well, their team had really good cc so your YI kinda cant move even if hes fed tooo
[0:46:45] jimbob_ywert: Mordes E does easily pop Mundos shield
[0:46:51] mrshibasan: Oh you ask what item to go first for ori you can go for archangel or stormsurge or shadowflame as your first
[0:46:52] EgoLifter: Finally i am unbanned
[0:46:59] jeroenvijver: morde his pull also takes away mundo shield
[0:47:06] redtauro: @Smoothcollie @littlejellyfishy thank you <3 I  will go do some reading FeelsOkayMan
[0:47:08] Hottentott7: @kaypea Do you think you play differently when you stream than otherwise? :)

[0:56:40] CynicalScrub: any good prediction ideas for this game?

[1:00:05] fluffycloudlove: oh wait I forgot there’s a trundle on enemy team #handslaptoface
[1:00:05] senatorsadface: sylas needs to achieve the level of banning yasuo did.
[1:00:10] TomNova: that grab looked iffy too, like it shouldnt have hit
[1:00:13] dany_falcon: @KayPea early his heal was much crazy ... it was so painful ....
[1:00:14] georgo__: I mean instead of the auto
[1:00:16] Smoothcollie: @georgo__ don't think so, the ult needs a little time to scale it

[1:16:58] NickRSA: it's one thing being shit at the game versus being a shit person, so the only person I am irritated at from that game is actually Cait
[1:17:15] Bennodkk: @exorc157 malignace, sorch boots, stormsuge, hourglass, deathcap, and i've been trying cryptbloom but there are probably another item you can build last
[1:17:22] mistermurr: It's grest to practice your patience tho kaypLOL
[1:17:26] senatorsadface: its understandable if she was simply having a bad game, but split pushing on 1hp is just inexcuseable
[1:17:46] jeroenvijver: its also just part of the game, u hit stuff and u get hit. no one is perfect

[1:37:37] m0mmyyyyyyy_: I looove the heartsteel boing sound
[1:37:38] jimbob_ywert: feel like we should stop focusing on the results of our next 5 games and instead of out next 100 games. I think that represents our true elo/placement overtime as it balances the shitty and good teammates as well
[1:37:50] senatorsadface: ive been reported 2 times because i tried to play TF, there wasnt a third time LOL

[1:41:36] AllyCaatt: it’s all the same

[1:43:19] Aracdar: @senatorsadface Don't get discouraged if you have a hard time at the beginning, you might need some time to adjust. At least i was like "I will never understand this" in beginning of my studies, everything turned out okay in the end.

[1:57:23] TomNova: its faster with her Q right ?
[1:57:26] quark978: the shyv fireball that she shoots thru minions is both her damage source, and how she stacks rage faster
[1:57:28] Shangoshi: rift> abyssal and maybe rylais if you have problem sticking to enemies
[1:57:34] GunzaPrime: Rylai's into Riftmaker?
[1:57:36] Almeroo_Hedaia: i believe that movement speed is op in leeague
[1:57:43] Natalia3123: why she uses a pot every time she gets hit? xd

[2:07:38] quark978: can Morde double cast his W to just heal?
[2:07:43] Shonji2611: If they got a lot of AP, Kaemic or w/e its called is insanely strong

[2:23:13] ragtimediddly: terrible macro and heavy tunneling never helps either.
[2:23:19] Darkcyter: @TurtleIam 75 kaypHYPERS WB

[2:24:50] eliasd2: nice music
[2:24:59] bluesiies: legitkorea's been playing ahri top and he does pretty well
[2:25:02] redtauro: the fabric dangling around her arms on her Spirit Blossom skin triggers me. I feel like they would suck in a fight and be so bothersome. I know it's a weird problem to have LUL
[2:25:03] Darkcyter: kaypFreya Freya the cloud pup

[2:26:16] jimbob_ywert: Autocorrect
[2:26:23] redtauro: @bluesiies LUL seriously, all that fabric dangling constantly. I can't even stand shirts or sweatshirts covering my forearms
[2:26:35] Daddy_Shoe: i have to go eat something before a volleyball game, but i hope rest of games are good for you!

[2:27:19] KiloJar: KiloJar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! new year, same ssalt kaypTroll2
[2:27:28] redtauro: I like Vlad but I can't understand how people do ok with him during laning phase. I can't manage his early cooldowns well
[2:27:31] BioTrecko: Yo KayPea!! PrideLionChomp.  I'm watching stream on my big screen to catch all the plays lol  let's goo!!!
[2:27:44] bluesiies: makes no sense because they have no resource to manage
[2:28:03] WildBandersnatch3: makes no reason to keep playing mana required champs baffyShrug
[2:28:17] KiloJar: some new items is kinda bs kaypJudge
[2:28:18] redtauro: @bluesiies I remember Riot saying they regret having made Vladimir. That hurt FeelsBadMan
[2:28:36] jimbob_ywert: I feel like that would lessen the variety in champion creativity
[2:28:39] catttini: i think there are broken things in the game, but i think it never gonna be a win. someone is always gonna find something to complain about
[2:29:12] WildBandersnatch3: garen doesnt care about your silly mana he just spin to win
[2:29:37] catttini: ah, i miss garen yuumi combo in urf. good times
[2:30:08] redtauro: I tried URF on PBE. I had around 230 ping FeelsWeirdMan
[2:30:12] reginaphalange00: @catttini not a good time for me WutFace
[2:30:21] catttini: Oooh its on pbe??
[2:30:36] tomas4848: @redtauro same, i want to play urf so bad but the lag is so annoying
[2:30:40] luinardo: honestly once you get like 3 items as long as you don't die more than once vlad just kills everything in sight, dumb champ really
[2:30:40] catttini: @reginaphalange00 missing outtt. i think lillia yuumi combo in urf is my favorite though OMEGALUL
[2:30:43] jimbob_ywert: then I’d agree with you! but for Sylas I feel it’d be better if they nerfed the impact his ults do. like Soraka heals significantly lower than a normal soraka jlt
[2:30:57] redtauro: @tomas4848 I love URF, and sometimes they always release it when Im busiest at work PunOko
[2:31:04] redtauro: somehow*
[2:31:50] k0t10n: i think riot hates mages
[2:31:56] k0t10n: just a hunch
[2:31:59] redtauro: so how did the new and hyped mage items work for mages?
[2:32:06] ericaborgest: hi friends!! happy Sunday kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello

[2:33:16] yayaaura: pls do die
[2:33:45] senatorsadface: lets go nurse ahri!!
[2:33:52] HeyDestineeRea: Idk kind of annoying that Ahri's max health got cut when they added more healing into her kit but his champ is built around healing and yet his max health scales with ap
[2:33:55] k0t10n: i cant believe it man kelsie is succesfully last hitting cannons>
[2:33:57] ericaborgest: How are the games today? I'm late PoroSad
[2:34:07] yayaaura: nurse? it’s pop ahri

[2:35:03] ericaborgest: niceeeee
[2:35:07] redtauro: ooh the clutch from the Sheriff herself
[2:35:07] k0t10n: did ahri just have an interaction with pyke?
[2:35:09] S17Master: Sit down, Pyke
[2:35:16] Boembele: Vlad and Ahri are pretty similar when you think about it. One sucks your blood the other your soul
[2:35:25] redtauro: make her healing passive also restore mana PunOko
[2:36:01] k0t10n: kp what do you think of cryptobloom?
[2:36:18] bluesiies: @senatorsadface you're 100% right she looks so much like a nurse with this chroma
[2:36:19] senatorsadface: they need to buff ahri where her charm one shots in my opinion
[2:36:29] G006ie: why has riot put me into an 11 game loser que
[2:36:33] senatorsadface: @bluesiies  IKR
[2:36:41] redtauro: give Deathfire Grasp effect to her charm back!
[2:37:14] chillombian: Hi KP good to see you --- have you played that flying ice bird lately or is ahri your new fave?

[2:49:21] catttini: i notice (in aram anyway) that the new ludens isn't like, reccomended for any mages i played. is it a bad item now?
[2:49:24] chuckitdeep: It'll be better, it'll balance out
[2:49:36] Goriyay: i wish riot would give these people 1 second chance, and then ban the acc- shits too common just get them all off league
[2:49:42] k0t10n: GIRL POWER WOOOOOOOOO
[2:49:57] ericaborgest: I feel like MF and pyke is such a strong duo bot
[2:50:23] dieKreTzn: thats what i dont like in league. If you want to win, u cant carry 1v5 anymore, but if you have someone who wants to lose, you have no chance of winning
[2:50:29] catcreeture: viego is also doing very well
[2:50:35] SpringSong: why you should play any other game when weekend thats perfect example KEKW kaypLeave
[2:50:41] cypc: IDK how you keep a cool head, i don't have that much patience lol

[2:50:57] minnievb: hi <3
[2:51:00] mrry2k: if he starts playing even if its just for some utility u can win quite realistically its just sad
[2:51:05] RoboLaRuez: teemo chasing rengar is kinda funny low key lol
[2:51:13] k0t10n: if that rengar was in my team id throw the entire book at him

[2:57:45] Deveix: #CommandoLuxTime
[2:57:47] jimbob_ywert: Dark cosmic lux skin?
[2:58:14] ChiSkillz: @dieKreTzn I think vanguard is the first step.  There are a ton of people like teenagers and college kids that believe it or not couldn't afford it
[2:58:23] temojay: oh i hate yone
[2:58:27] ericaborgest: I love me some lux game plays kaypCheer
[2:58:39] jimbob_ywert: I miss when they made good skins like the cosmic skin line, the newer skin lines just seem like splash art marketing with no creativity or passion

[2:59:56] Deveix: that drop felt personal kaypRonin
[2:59:57] lilCACTUSS9: You know what I hate in this game? Whenever I think a new item buff or a completely new item would work really good on Lux, and I get rly excited, it turns out that specific item works even better on Fizz, Diana etc. @KayPea I'm rly pissed that rn Fizz buys Lichbane and Stormsurge and he basically doesn't need any more items for the rest of the game
[3:00:01] ChiSkillz: Alright.  a just win angle
[3:00:01] itz_loz_: KAYPEA I’ve missed you 😭😂
