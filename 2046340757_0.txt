[0:53:28] ilovechcolate: Team made by a streamer
[0:53:35] Schlagitow: and it's the people's team like they are very popular because of banter
[0:53:36] r00____: its very similar to Nadeshot and 100T
[0:53:39] xGasai: because KC win a lot too from Div 2 FR to EUM very fast

[1:26:45] i_artoria_i: only against ranged top
[1:26:50] ramsex2: yes because funny
[1:26:50] eqquilibriuum: I mean isnt that what Aatrox does that so many champs?
[1:26:50] M3T_R3MIX: @Naayil because this champ late game doesnt exist
[1:26:53] KitagoToro: Well as you said you will outscale him right
[1:26:53] ItzShade10: certain champs i think deserve that respect..  as long as there is reasonable counterplay in later stages
[1:26:53] skratch99: knowing your champ strengths ig
[1:26:53] ramsex2: pick a champ
[1:26:56] juiandy: yes, some champ cant play late game
[1:26:56] M3T_R3MIX: u only play him for lane?
[1:27:00] nightmarehost982: because he had to be strong at some stage in the game
[1:27:00] azaz0999010: ye, you outscale anyway so there needs to be counter play
[1:27:01] Aarguil: @xxx_scarface_xx darius weak lategame Clueless
[1:27:01] redarrowforlife: nothing, champ diff
[1:27:02] colodos: yes, cause you can predict that
[1:27:03] uncle_ruckus1337: Because darius is weak late game KEKW
[1:27:05] soranthepilot: it should, if there is a counterplay to it. Unfortunately, there is none
[1:27:05] hassiktiryha3: cause they are trying to back to 2016 lol
[1:27:06] uncle_ruckus1337: kappa
[1:27:07] hscoolx: Yes his champ stronger early
[1:27:13] n1ghtl1ght22: darius is not that weak late
[1:27:13] Cupwins: It obviously shouldn't be in the game but the entire riot game balance team consists of 4 cavemen banging rocks together and flinging their shit around @Naayil
[1:27:23] KitagoToro: because that's not who darius is
[1:27:23] colodos: well, why we cant make perfect game?
[1:27:25] shaaarktrox: i mean thats how hes balanced
[1:27:27] skratch99: LOL
[1:27:30] ramsex2: Becase if you do that to all champs all champs are the same and the game is boring @Naayil
[1:27:33] hassiktiryha3: old darius is coming back
[1:27:40] 18PAIN: should champions like aatrox have a million lifesteal? haha
[1:27:43] juiandy: riot want different champ and different play style
[1:27:53] M3T_R3MIX: @Naayil because not all the champion can be playble at all stages and on every rank even tho i would like the idea more
[1:27:59] ItzShade10: i think its fine tbh.. u either stomp early and snowball it into a win or u become useless and pray ur team carries
[1:27:59] Cupwins: @18PAIN tryndamere q moment
[1:28:07] pastitsiosss: because we need a variety of champs.
[1:28:10] noxzius999v2: As a darius main i think his passive could get a nerf lol maybe make it max 180 bonus AD and reduce early game d
[1:28:20] naynnyv: classic bot les go

[2:25:52] Chipez: Its just math
[2:25:56] darhlin1: But bro is ignoring he's two games in a row in red-side. Plus, it was a samira vs a bloddy swain. No way in hell she wins that
[2:26:01] archsik: 1 single person is fact and guranteed to be better than
[2:26:09] archsik: 2 person its basic
[2:26:18] The_Coconut_Boss: Crybaby bot laners arent allowed in this chat
[2:26:27] deepseaAstronomy: Isn't it samira's job to mitigate the loss if she's countered tho?

[3:20:55] masuta27: @godgrid17 at one point in the game a mission will pop up when your facing a Kayle or Morgana. Kill either of them twice and your R last longer and you get visually bigger (like a Chogath). Btw there's also a Kayle buff if she kills Aatrox first.
