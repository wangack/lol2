[1:30:23] zayden032: Why are you playing fortune? Is jhin weak this patch?

[1:34:12] shadow_boi1: @kaiserwroth I bet he bought his osha certificate Susge
[1:34:42] soadjunky: Double up on turrets would be awesome
[1:34:42] Vladdddddddddddddddd: she could so easy 1 v1 you :D
[1:34:55] Tawrus_: OMEGALUL i've never seen first strike give +0 gold before
[1:34:58] Brock0Lee69: You forgot an auto
[1:35:07] Staminah: 1
[1:35:24] XIII_Member: Brb, gotta atend my cooking

[1:37:06] shadow_boi1: @XIII_Member What's raw, what you cooking
[1:37:09] TopKeks_senpai123: @kaiserwroth DL is actually good lmao
[1:37:16] XIII_Member: @shadow_boi1 Spaghetti
[1:37:27] shadow_boi1: @shadow_boi1 omg I could really go for some spaghetti rn
[1:37:34] Jeaidfuis: Man. Just when I'm learning stuff I get smacked with a mid roll ad. Thanks twitch
[1:37:50] XIII_Member: I made the sauce myself, and just waiting for the pasta to soften
[1:37:57] reaper_of_aspects: whats better for mf first strike or arcane comet?
[1:38:15] SuaveADC: arcane comet is surely mf support
[1:38:22] SuaveADC: and i wouldnt recommend mf support rn lol
[1:38:24] XIII_Member: @reaper_of_aspects Dank Harvest Kappa
[1:38:28] Vladdddddddddddddddd: @reaper_of_aspects first strike better , arcane was for the old build, where you poke with E
[1:38:41] CictorGabriel: Sadge
[1:38:41] mEczem: unloucky shen
[1:38:51] Strawb3wy: eavLurk hi taco hi chat eavOWO
[1:38:52] MysticMachia: NA pros make for their enemies to make mistakes, when they should instead create the mistakes for their enemies to make.
[1:38:53] Nightbot: dogshit kerfuckle perma clowning around throwing shit at each other, APES TOGETHER STRONG
[1:38:54] cristiz23: shen ult is disgusting
[1:38:54] TopKeks_senpai123: that flay was good
[1:39:07] MysticMachia: wait for their enemy*
[1:39:13] reaper_of_aspects: ah i see
[1:39:32] Strawb3wy: Nessie
[1:39:33] stumpytail101: Danny's 2v5 pentakill baron steal against TL is one of the best plays i've ever seen
[1:39:39] MysticMachia: NA pros wait for their enemies to make mistakes, when they should instead create the mistakes for their enemies to make.*
[1:39:39] Nightbot: dogshit kerfuckle perma clowning around throwing shit at each other, APES TOGETHER STRONG
[1:39:52] XIII_Member: MF passive applies to wards, huh? Therefore, it should deal 2 damage on the first hit to a ward
[1:39:59] XIII_Member: LET ME COOK
[1:40:33] TopKeks_senpai123: I think that's just norms issues
[1:40:43] ThatOneLegitGuy: You make very good youtube videos mr jhin man
[1:40:48] r3ckl3ss04: didn‚Äôt NA beat EUW first seed at worlds? it might not be that we‚Äôre bad it‚Äôs just that other regions are really good
[1:40:52] r3ckl3ss04: like Korea and china
[1:40:54] Dubatt0: @Strawb3wy Fricc
[1:41:05] Strawb3wy: @Dubatt0 Fricc
[1:41:09] Strawb3wy: bich
[1:41:11] MysticMachia: So basically the further to Korea we go, the more aggressive the player
[1:41:14] Dubatt0: bich
[1:41:16] MysticMachia: LUL
[1:41:45] slr_george: @r3ckl3ss04 yeah but i think historically eu has performed better in worlds
[1:41:46] TopKeks_senpai123: honestly from what i've seen is that ppl are just afraid to make plays/punishing minor mistakes
[1:41:53] XIII_Member: @Strawb3wy Beach
[1:41:55] kaiserwroth: In NA being aggressive meant bringing back the fear from real life into their games so not surprising they play Ultra Safe copiumGalaxy
[1:42:19] MysticMachia: what does that mean @kaiserwroth
[1:42:30] mute_mousou: yeah there are a million different environmental factors that would cause players to play differently in different regions
[1:42:44] TheOldN07: I think korean players play with a strategy in mind , and they tend to understand the mechanics of the game ova not only of 1 champ
[1:42:50] Strawb3wy: @XIII_Member eavSmug
[1:42:57] thechosen___1: Fiora is doing work
[1:42:59] Tawrus_: @kaiserwroth what is bro cooking
[1:43:07] Vladdddddddddddddddd: koreans also have complete different aproach to games in general
[1:43:18] XIII_Member: Remember Chat, if you play Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 and you make a Female Majin, be sure to make her 100% smashable. If you don't make her smashable, what's the point?
[1:43:28] TopKeks_senpai123: @Vladdddddddddddddddd korean also ff 15 half the time when things goes south
[1:43:30] XIII_Member: This is a passage from the book "Android 21 and her consequences"
[1:43:36] MysticMachia: @theoldn07 don't most pros and higher elo players, play with a strategy in mind
[1:44:32] demonshine: !opgg
[1:44:32] jrevans95: whats the difference between grudge and ldr? @IKeepItTaco
[1:44:32] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[1:44:35] Yez64: not jinx?
[1:44:59] demonshine: @jrevans95 grudge slows
[1:45:01] kaiserwroth: It‚Äôs the psychological fear that only Americans from the late millennium/ early gen z experience via the 9/11 attacks
[1:45:01] MysticMachia: They put the Korean homework into Google translate I understand
[1:45:13] zbrdzan: So taco i ur opinion is EU better than NA
[1:45:19] ElTozo101: !rank
[1:45:19] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[1:45:24] PiTastesGood: does mf w give more than the passive movespeed when you use it? or does it just set it to max
[1:45:24] erasor954: i mean koreans and chinese are also just better mechanically
[1:45:36] itsnotyaboys: @ikeepittaco is it better to go seryldas on lethality mf, I usually go ldr to for extra damage against high hp enemies and the extra crit for ult and auto
[1:45:54] Azzapp: 190 raiders from Azzapp have joined! 
[1:45:58] kaiserwroth: It‚Äôs the American culture they think talking shit makes them good ICANT
[1:46:01] Azzapp: Azzapp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months, currently on a 54 month streak! JhinZhao
[1:46:02] partu112: azzaSpin azzaSpin azzaSpin azzaSpin azzaSpin azzaSpin
[1:46:18] Macklez_: TL vs T1 at worlds was a GREAT example of Nas weaknesses. They outplayed t1 early game mechanically but then CHOKED when it came to mid/late game decision making
[1:46:22] zafironius: @erasor954 it depends because for china there are just more people and for both its early game focused so naturally they up their mechanics to win early gme
[1:46:39] thechosen___1: bro mf is so boring
[1:46:43] The_Tillter: azzaSpin azzaSpin azzaSpin azzaSpin
[1:46:49] Hoytastic: When women chess players play against men, their win rate is lower when its against men but its anonymous so they dont know theyre against men
[1:46:52] zafironius: scaling doesnt exist in KR and CN
[1:46:55] Syvvak: Miss4thJhin

[1:47:10] Revares: ikeepitSMILERS
[1:47:10] Vladdddddddddddddddd: its also a natural thing, if they have x10 more players the chance of them having more insane talents is also higher
[1:47:13] The_Tillter: azzaPlink azzaYapp azzaBusiness
[1:47:14] emeseeeee: Love how the mic cut out on that scream
[1:47:35] Strawb3wy: eavNod
[1:47:53] Elemas528: gz taco !
[1:47:56] zafironius: @Vladdddddddddddddddd that and if your team perma ffs when its 0/5 at 10 min you learn to beat the lane lmao
[1:48:05] MysticMachia: @vladdddddddddddddddd korea doesn't have 10x more players though
[1:48:24] ikesha99: but dl from ur mh no? xd
[1:48:25] erasor954: @Hoytastic i dont even know why chess is like half-devided in gender. Women have their own tournaments but can also participate in the "normal" events. Makes no sense for a "sport" that doesnt have to do shit with muscles/strength
[1:48:32] thechosen___1: she didn‚Äôt know you are alone
[1:48:33] kaiserwroth: Nah it‚Äôs the quality of high elo in both regions in NA once the other casual players Hit gm they start slacking off cause they think they‚Äôve hit their peak and don‚Äôt bother to improve
[1:48:40] KittyCatiu: maybe she thinks that she's never gonna win so she doesn't even try
[1:48:44] lol_puio: Hey Taco can you tell me what is going on with lp gain I have a 55%wr and just got 16 lp for a game??
[1:48:52] zafironius: @MysticMachia lol and gaming in general is alot more popular STILL in korea from a young age (gaming in NA and eu is popular but not just lol)
[1:49:01] slothbacon_: teach apricot league unstoppable frogduo
[1:49:18] snowbni: @lol_puio good luck i had +11 -36 for a while
[1:49:19] XIII_Member: @lol_puio I have 10% WR and get +32 LUL
[1:49:30] TopKeks_senpai123: @zafironius that's just classic korea/tw
[1:49:33] lol_puio: dont know why
[1:49:34] KHJGames: hes climbing with hwei in EUW rn
[1:49:34] thyquacker: hes doing hwei to challenger rn
[1:49:48] Vladdddddddddddddddd: @MysticMachia yeah it was just an example, but even if it has x2 more thats already a big big difference and the top tier skill level gets higher
[1:49:51] XIII_Member: Do you know da Hwei?
[1:49:52] MysticMachia: @zafironius that's not the point though
[1:50:01] kaiserwroth: 1W9L is 10%, 2W18L is also 10%, you need to be more specific
[1:50:09] zafironius: @TopKeks_senpai123 literally the only other game thats popular in korea is pubg (and some gachas)
[1:50:36] slr_george: @IKeepItTaco does playing good not matter?
[1:50:44] slr_george: even if you lose
[1:50:44] TopKeks_senpai123: @zafironius you forgot starcraft Nerdge
[1:50:51] typo114: maplemaDRIVING maplemaDRIVING
[1:50:59] Axioios: what runes vs cait?
[1:51:00] kaiserwroth: League lets the Koreans escape from reality it‚Äôs their ideal world compared to real life COPIUM
[1:51:04] Thats_Pretty_Buzzy: should I abandon my son he plays yuumi
[1:51:19] r3ckl3ss04: I had that issue. and decided to just make a new account. I was platinum 3 with +18-32. on a new account with normal gains I ended up getting diamond 4 lol
[1:51:20] zafironius: @TopKeks_senpai123 not really anymore i imagine 2 new gens have grown up tekken is more popular than starcraft
[1:51:21] Sakyn: tobiasSLEEP

[1:52:35] Aletu7: im high diamond but for some reason I struggle to carry more in low elos, what gives?
[1:52:54] flameravana: hey taco! How've the games been today?
[1:52:59] yulianferros: hot nun mf borpaLickL
[1:53:13] LilyJade1120: HUHH
[1:53:18] Surgicalscrub: HUH
[1:53:22] Aletu7: true, sadge that I cant really play any other role as good as adc
[1:53:24] Xdelahozx: HUH
[1:53:26] MysticMachia: So basically, you can only carry if your team let's you.~
[1:53:31] zafironius: borpaLickR fed taco borpaLickL
[1:53:36] thechosen___1: xD
[1:53:36] Nightbot: XD
[1:53:42] kaiserwroth: HUH
[1:53:43] r3ckl3ss04: don‚Äôt some challenger players like Karasmai just perma tax lanes and steal all the resources to carry themselves?
[1:53:50] Anshostin: !scene
[1:53:50] Nightbot: TACO TACO TACO Friendly reminder to change scene, good luck on your game! ikeepitKOMRADEBOI @IKeepItTaco
[1:54:02] zafironius: no egirls as d1 sadWankge
[1:54:04] yulianferros: DogeKEK
[1:54:31] Aletu7: all that has been said is factual, how do you adapt to lower elos? any tips
[1:54:42] zafironius: @r3ckl3ss04 yes but karasmai is leagues above other kayns
[1:54:44] kaiserwroth: All the egirls are at d4 so the simps auto filter themselves ICANT
[1:55:10] yulianferros: Im a sigma toplaner so no egirls for me Smoge
[1:55:13] XIII_Member: Kay guys, I'm back
[1:55:16] XIII_Member: Dinner time
[1:55:16] Aletu7: thank you @IKeepItTaco I appreciate it
[1:55:18] snowbni: in pisslow you play as adc, get to 16/0 and still dont get peel xdding
[1:55:36] HERME__: @IKeepItTaco Hey taco do you think Jhin is the strongest he's ever been right now?
[1:55:37] MysticMachia: And play MF so you ain't massively reliant on support
[1:55:38] cherryxdonut: @r3ckl3ss04 difference is that kara actually has patience compared to most kayn players and can genuinely help carry
[1:55:50] zafironius: @Aletu7 just play early game agency adcs that can solo side lane like lucian draven trist varus
[1:55:58] XIII_Member: I miss being able to stack IEs. I miss it a lot
[1:56:00] TopKeks_senpai123: in bronze I just do whatever and pray my team can carry themselves
[1:56:02] Aletu7: yeah its just really embarassing to try to carry my friend and sometimes I fail, but I know Im way better
[1:57:17] SukiPlus: hi taco
[1:57:29] flameravana: does mf q work the same way as jhin q where if you kill the minion before the q bounces to them it does more damage?
[1:57:40] zafironius: @flameravana y
[1:57:47] MysticMachia: remember to compliment your teammates and boost morale, so team wants to win as well, people just trash eachother in lower elo
[1:58:11] LilyJade1120: oh this is the ali from earlier
[1:58:18] zafironius: @MysticMachia tbh it gets kinda weird when someone glazes me perma for anything i do
[1:58:31] TopKeks_senpai123: @MysticMachia I just stop playing when my team trrash talk me
[1:58:41] HERME__: brand is the goat
[1:58:45] SukiPlus: huge
[1:58:46] r3ckl3ss04: this brand is insane

[2:27:51] Nightbot: Hi IKeepItTaco I was the brand that played with you last game. I would appreciate you not talk bad about him,considering the fact that you were the one playing the laning phase horribly. ONLY reason we won that game was because I stayed cool and realized I had to play without and adc, so next time know your matchups otherwise you are gonna keep staying small
[2:27:53] Zeychin: @besandrio It's forbidden to buy it on Caitlyn in competitive play right now.
[2:28:12] nikurashi: @besandrio any vids for that stuff, i heard about it but dosent find it in u.gg
[2:28:20] better_call_sion: @besandrio does cait's passive need a couple of autos to refresh the headshot?

[2:32:14] Zeychin: Ended Master MMR last split and then it felt like it was Gold games when I played at beginning of the season.
[2:32:14] DrFeely: mental as an adc gets broken with some of these supps
[2:32:31] Zeychin: At least 2 players in every game are COMPLETELY lost.
[2:32:59] better_call_sion: Taco imma be honest I dont know how you can solo q adc and win XD
[2:33:02] cherryxdonut: my friend has it

[2:37:12] KayXOTV: REM
[2:37:17] MannenMedDrag: You might have sleep apnea perhaps, do you snore?
[2:37:20] prisonpapi: There's a special test for SIBO - hydrogen methane test that, stomach ultrasound would be also great, but def should be checking with gastrologist first and getting bloodwork done again. Chronic fatique could be also due to deficienies - b12, iron, witamin d, plenty more.
[2:37:21] Komlin111: do you dream and go through sleep cycles
[2:37:29] Skaftoise: @IKeepItTaco check your thyroid

[2:38:40] DrFeely: apnea
[2:38:40] prisonpapi: Im a weteran when it comes to this subject, i lived with IBS almost my whole life and cured it with lifestyle changes and diet. Don't hesitate to hit me up anytime if you need some directions.
[2:38:40] nickysh: he said fatigue not trouble sleeping
[2:39:13] MannenMedDrag: Lack of quality sleep can make you feel fatigued
[2:39:15] DrFeely: but fatigue goes with it. lots of time you don‚Äôt notice it
[2:39:19] nickysh: good point
[2:39:20] saintceniza: whats your fave skin taco :3
[2:39:25] DrFeely: it‚Äôs a quality of sleep
[2:39:27] better_call_sion: Yo there is fake sleep too?

[2:39:33] Komlin111: do you feel tired after exercise?
[2:39:49] MannenMedDrag: Do you cook "real food" like eat a balanced diet
[2:39:53] Skaftoise: @IKeepItTaco tiredness and fatigue is associated with Thryroid issues
[2:39:55] StraightErro: @better_call_sion tossing, turning, trouble breathing.... you are out cold, so you don't know it's happening
[2:39:56] snowysunflower: isnt sleep apnea when you stop breathing for a few seconds while sleeping?
[2:40:01] DrFeely: I have a lot of family with sleep apnea they could sleep 12 h and still feel tired. or burn out super quick
[2:40:02] KayXOTV: get sun in the morning
[2:40:08] MannenMedDrag: Vitamins can help if taken by pills of course but gotten from food its a different thing
[2:40:23] thyquacker: huh why not jhin
[2:40:27] luisthemexican6: how do you play against ezreal as jhin
[2:40:28] final_zangetsu: any advice on fighting a cheese lane? i fought urgot maokai and had no idea what todo
[2:40:46] Komlin111: your jungle is a clown peepoClown
[2:40:49] MannenMedDrag: Balanced diet, excercise 5 ish times a day including running and walking at least 30mins is what's recommended perhaps this can help?
[2:40:54] MannenMedDrag: times a week*
[2:40:57] kekkeroni1: @luisthemexican6 just smash that little kid
[2:41:13] crecentbear: go pcp and get a cmb
[2:41:14] nickysh: primary care first
[2:41:16] prisonpapi: endocrynologist
[2:41:18] Scizor021: bloodwork covers thyroid. Primary doc
[2:41:20] crecentbear: cmb = complete metabolic panel
[2:41:25] Skaftoise: if you can see an endocrinologist, but most ppl need a referral i think @IKeepItTaco
[2:41:29] hambone_cam: primary then referral to ENT

[2:41:38] Criz7z: yeah, taco I was going through the same thing it is the lack of REM sleep and I can tell you you need to relax your body before going to bed. Try your best to do breathing exercises , actually works for me was CBD but I don‚Äôt know if you like that.
[2:41:45] Macklez_: tiredness and fatigue can literally be anything is the issue
[2:41:51] prisonpapi: @Macklez_ exactly
[2:42:04] KayXOTV: no screen time an hour before bed could help
[2:42:14] crecentbear: routine before bed each night is best instead of spontaneously going to bed
[2:42:21] peshecito: relaxing tea works wonders before sleep ikeepitLOVERBOI
[2:42:24] prisonpapi: please consider getting tested for food intolerance as well
[2:42:29] Tegone_: i have the same exact thing for the last few years so im writing this all down too lol
[2:42:30] Komlin111: I shouldn't use electronics past 11pm
[2:42:54] nickysh: gluten?
[2:42:54] KayXOTV: donuts? Lol
[2:43:03] Komlin111: gluten from donuts?
[2:43:04] WizardPug: get blood work done? it can tell you a lot
[2:43:08] MannenMedDrag: If he was gluten for three years he would've noticed
[2:43:18] keb_v1: donuts are my fav nuts
[2:43:22] Anshostin: ermagerd
[2:43:38] puchiro: do other greezy foods do that to
[2:43:38] nickysh: donuts are fried
[2:43:40] better_call_sion: maybe cause you kept eating rhe same stuff for a year?
[2:43:40] Skaftoise: yeast?
[2:43:43] prisonpapi: gluten could be the reason
[2:43:55] nickysh: ya fried/grease for sure
[2:43:57] KayXOTV: well everyone feel shit on mc donalds
[2:43:59] WizardPug: IBS maybe?
[2:44:00] DrFeely: have you got tested for diabetes too? since you talked about needing sugar to help
[2:44:01] MannenMedDrag: hmm could be a bile issue
[2:44:08] Komlin111: eggs and oil maybe? idk what else would cause that
[2:44:12] CuznVin: could it be the energy drinks as well?
[2:44:30] prisonpapi: are you taking probiotics?
[2:44:33] crecentbear: im in med school and watching chat come up w differentials is entertaining ngl lol
[2:45:29] puchiro: if i eat to much greezy foods my body can feels really sluggish and i will lose a lot of my energy
[2:45:35] MannenMedDrag: Isn't Lucian good into mf tho?
[2:45:47] Komlin111: stopbeingMean
[2:46:15] KayXOTV: sona so boring
[2:46:40] Kwidu: all enchanters are boring i guess
[2:47:01] prisonpapi: i find enchanters fun to play
[2:47:21] Kwidu: yea but playing against is frustrating
[2:47:38] Kwidu: cause shields and heals in lane, you cant kill, just have to farm

[2:49:58] thecutecheerleader: is mf still that broken?
[2:50:03] puchiro: the tiredness could also be caused by mental issues like not feeling fulfilled or other things going on

[2:55:18] luisthemexican6: you dont care about riven life? lol
[2:55:18] crecentbear: @crecentbear what'd you need to ask me
[2:55:46] thecutecheerleader: tbh i admire taco for giving enough fks to type to ppl
[2:55:56] GabrielDS_23: funny how I just saw your video where you talk about the "two types of supports" and now you get this naut Kappa
[2:56:11] thecutecheerleader: i my mental could never
[2:56:18] KayXOTV: adc meta XD
[2:56:20] better_call_sion: @crecentbear How often should one get his heart checked? One of my relatives found out recently he had heart problems and needed surgery and got me worried
[2:56:22] Komlin111: Painge
[2:56:37] Shagidzun: it's not just na apparently
[2:56:39] Strawb3wy: eavCheer u got this
[2:56:42] Atellophobic: why would teams make the smart play catSpin
[2:56:44] crecentbear: @better_call_sion funny you ask about heart bc im in my cardio block of school rn haha
[2:56:58] XIII_Member: You see, maybe they did what I do: When a teammate uses the chat a lot, even for what it was intended for, I just find it annoying and mute them, even if that loses us the game because we didn't listen to their calls. Or maybe they were bad calls. Anyhow, they probably muted you like 10 minutes ago LUL
[2:57:04] DrFeely: it is bad man I know what you say had a jug just throw an easy win thinking he‚Äôs right. lost
[2:57:08] crecentbear: @crecentbear i would say if its a close relative (like brother, mom, grandparent) you could go get a screening
[2:57:42] crecentbear: @crecentbear most heart issues can be genetically coupled so you can get screening to check but also wait until you're having symptoms too
[2:58:00] better_call_sion: ok makes sense
[2:58:19] crecentbear: general idea is wait until symptoms appear if not, wouldn't worry
[2:58:24] HERME__: did you know Twitch's W procs banshee before it even lands? Just played MF and got my banshee popped all the time even when nothing touched me, checked the VOD and found out about it
[2:58:56] HERME__: but how can I be mad at riot games when it's a small indie company Kappa
[3:00:31] Surgicalscrub: what a game
[3:00:43] dracula_coffin: Greedy greedy
[3:00:53] Strawb3wy: its not greedy
[3:01:00] Strawb3wy: wuh
[3:01:10] GabrielDS_23: griddy?
[3:01:19] Strawb3wy: POGGERS
[3:01:28] simones112: Thoughts on the state of adc itemization?

[3:03:29] Macklez_: How is Jhin with LeeSin support?
[3:03:36] Surgicalscrub: lol
[3:03:40] matsosdm: lived
[3:04:45] juletta1_: @Macklez_ i had such an experience recently. Felt great - Lee did great
[3:04:53] siiskow2: best build for jhin rn ?
[3:05:36] simones112: defo some lethality
[3:05:38] matsosdm: im a jhin main and i hate mf is that bad?
[3:05:51] simones112: Mf is really really strong
[3:05:56] 0xshan: Adc is so depressing to play right now
[3:06:00] 0xshan: Got the least changes
[3:06:04] HERME__: MF is probably 2nd best adc right now
[3:06:12] Jazziph: @HERME__ in low elo
[3:06:20] simones112: @Jazziph the #1
[3:06:24] simones112: then*
[3:06:25] HERME__: @Jazziph ye I believe so
[3:06:25] Jazziph: gets way worse the higher you go
[3:06:47] matsosdm: i know she is very good but i like jhin soo much i can‚Äôt play with other adcs
[3:06:56] Jazziph: YEah in low elo Jhin and MF are prob the best to play rn
[3:06:59] Zariss: Time to sell everything and go AP MF
[3:07:00] Jazziph: almost free win
[3:07:06] ensnarer: !elo
[3:07:06] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44
[3:07:06] HERME__: Jhin is best in every elo though
[3:07:29] Jazziph: yeah but then you play against lucian nami/milio in high elo and is unmplayable
[3:07:33] matsosdm: depends on ur supp though
[3:07:37] Jazziph: ^
[3:07:41] Jazziph: every adc depends on support
[3:07:45] better_call_sion: Does anyone still play Zeri except the scripters?
[3:07:54] LilyJade1120: enemy team is quite tanky
[3:08:00] matsosdm: who tf is zeri
[3:08:04] Strawb3wy: peepoCheer
[3:08:18] HERME__: I can see alistar doing fine into this bot lane? as milio lucian. early is a bit tough but his passive keeps both of you alive and after first recall you can win the lane
[3:08:42] better_call_sion: Keepo perhaps I shouldn't ask about the blue ghost lady
[3:08:46] Surgicalscrub: winnable?
[3:08:48] Jazziph: @HERME__ you just wait until ali uses combo and then you 1tap adc every time
[3:09:00] chickenjohnny64: keep your head up pookie
[3:09:21] Rasitsu: wiep wieep
[3:09:49] tonino412: ICANT
[3:09:54] pocztowka_z_lotniska: the game is so bursty wtf, i swear the 1st day of the season was the stormsurge buff and then poof it s all lethality
[3:09:55] Chaaqui21: why
[3:10:05] lethalbonsai: hi taco hi chat
[3:10:08] tonino412: This should be bannable as wintrading
[3:10:15] HERME__: jesus
[3:10:22] damnravi: hey taco, im slowly climbing out of bronze on kaisa. Is she any good in the higher ranks?
[3:10:28] HERME__: monkaW
[3:10:32] nyxionite: hi bonsai
[3:10:44] HERME__: @damnravi right now she's one of the worst adc LULW
[3:10:46] Surgicalscrub: the kayn paranoia
[3:10:51] MannenMedDrag: She is @damnravi watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMTcCVn441w
[3:10:57] thechosen___1: bro needs an invitation to jump on an adc
[3:11:03] Jazziph: @damnravi She's awful
[3:11:04] HERME__: @damnravi so respect for climbing with her
[3:11:12] Jazziph: don't play her if you want to win tbh
[3:11:13] Rasitsu: rasits1Love rasits1Love
[3:11:15] damnravi: @HERME__ i guess it only works in bronze then lmao uxorciToothless
[3:11:17] EpicHexManiac: welp i submitted a bug report. i dont know why it wont let me open my own lobbies on league.
[3:11:18] tonino412: What was that +0 gold
[3:11:35] HERME__: @MannenMedDrag oh that looks nice thanks I'm gonna watch it
[3:11:39] MannenMedDrag: Jazzi, Ddang thinks its decent, you don't consider it decent?
[3:11:52] lethalbonsai: @epichexmaniac dw i got chat restricted for using albanian to chat with tmy friend xD
[3:11:57] Jazziph: @MannenMedDrag Ddang the coach?
[3:12:01] MannenMedDrag: Yeah
[3:12:08] Jazziph: idk man I'm only a master pleb
[3:12:08] EpicHexManiac: @lethalbonsai im not banned or anything
[3:12:10] damnravi: im kinda surpised since im on like an 8 game win streak with her ... bronze do be like that tho
[3:12:12] Jazziph: I'm not a challenger korean coach
[3:12:16] better_call_sion: I think he will not yield
[3:12:19] Jazziph: but the general conception is that she's awful
[3:12:24] HERME__: last time I played kaisa was mid druta build kaisa and it was so damn good. this season kinda ruined her though Sadge
[3:12:36] Jazziph: Koreans are different
[3:12:39] Jazziph: they play on 5 ping
[3:12:44] EpicHexManiac: @lethalbonsai someone can invite me and we play just fine.
[3:13:06] lethalbonsai: @epichexmaniac riot is small indie company xD
[3:13:07] HERME__: in korea Ezreal is always S tier somehow, same for china they just play differently
[3:13:09] better_call_sion: How can Kaisa be bad btw? Isnt she Riot's favourite?
[3:13:23] tonino412: @HERME__ On hit build feels good since kraken now works with rageblade
[3:13:30] Jazziph: @better_call_sion Yeah but she was too broken for half of last year
[3:13:45] better_call_sion: still
[3:13:54] damnravi: i think ill stick to kaisa to get to silver but then maybe switch to jhin/varus maybe?
[3:14:14] MannenMedDrag: Guess she feels pretty bad against the lethality lain bullies - Draven is a bad matchup, Jhin is losing, Cait is bad, Lucian Milio is losing etc. I guess that's why she feels worse than last season @better_call_sion
[3:14:15] HERME__: @tonino412 ye that's pretty much my point, kraken sucks imo, like Stormrazor is so good compared to kraken
[3:14:19] Jazziph: @damnravi yeah
[3:14:27] Jazziph: but maybe start with Jhin now
[3:14:29] Jazziph: is too good
[3:14:35] sixsecondstrip: ikeepitSMILERS ikeepitSMILERS ikeepitLUCY
[3:14:38] HERME__: @MannenMedDrag same vs Varus and MF she just cant lane into this
[3:14:45] MannenMedDrag: Yeah
[3:14:48] better_call_sion: @mannenmeddrag buff her armor by 3 ! Keepo
[3:14:54] damnravi: @Jazziph sounds good!
[3:14:59] MannenMedDrag: There we go! @better_call_sion
[3:15:12] Skaftoise: it seems like you cant hit very hard against the champ named Ksante
[3:15:17] HERME__: usually kaisa's strength was her all in that let her 3 shot anyone if her support landed a cc
[3:15:24] dracula_coffin: Full ad into ksante with 0 armor pen
[3:15:39] Jazziph: @HERME__ yeah 100 hp on dorans made her bad in lane as well
[3:15:40] Surgicalscrub: not much damage there
[3:15:41] al0ukard: K'Sante needs to be nerfed away
[3:15:42] thechosen___1: bro this naut is ass
[3:15:42] DrFeely: as all na jungles say it‚Äôs not my job for you to win lane
[3:15:54] HERME__: @Jazziph true, these small changes add up
[3:16:26] crecentbear: damn team full ad
[3:16:30] tonino412: Shouldn't riven at least get cleaver since you are full ad
[3:17:37] HERME__: Taco you're one of the very few people I know won't throw their lead, you're way too consistent
[3:17:40] Rasitsu: hai tacco
[3:18:50] known_jester: Why don't you look for more risky solo plays to get your self ahead if you don't have faith in your team?
[3:19:19] Rasitsu: wats the best jhin build rn ? D;
[3:19:32] the_king7777777777: hiii
[3:19:38] HERME__: hi
[3:19:52] known_jester: Fucking rough man
[3:20:06] Rasitsu: oeeeh okokee tyyy
[3:20:10] al0ukard: is Jhin meta now?
[3:20:17] HERME__: is it okay to buy RFC third sometimes?
[3:21:14] known_jester: Would zeri be able to make solo plays like that?
[3:21:26] known_jester: Or is she not good now?
[3:21:34] the_king7777777777: @al0ukard no ig its varus meta
[3:21:46] better_call_sion: Zeri needs some zerious buffs to be good
[3:21:52] jadisworried: Hey, just picked up Jhin and the adc role in general and I'm a new chatter. Happy to be here and learn from the chief himself ! :)
[3:21:57] the_king7777777777: why dont u play varus?
[3:22:39] luisthemexican6: ap varus goes crazy againest tanks
[3:22:42] known_jester: Is terminus not a good item for zeri?
[3:23:03] lethalbonsai: @known_jester no
[3:23:05] better_call_sion: Taco what do you think about adcs that can build tank items with terminus
[3:23:17] the_king7777777777: @known_jester zeri is so weak this meta
[3:23:18] jadisworried: So is Lucian just a huge counter to Jhin then ?
[3:23:18] lethalbonsai: terminus is good for dps adcs
[3:23:23] lethalbonsai: that dive
[3:23:55] vsmilotic: nah number one is your own support KEKW
[3:24:03] better_call_sion: terminus jaksho seems good on paper
[3:24:04] jadisworried: What makes them such a threat ?
[3:24:15] known_jester: Kai sa should be pretty then tho no?
[3:24:27] lethalbonsai: @jadisworried draven trist twitch and lucian are diving dps champs
[3:24:30] Rasitsu: jhin n mf r meta right? or
[3:24:36] lethalbonsai: on trades they win
[3:24:48] jadisworried: @lethalbonsai Oh gotcha gotcha
[3:25:18] lethalbonsai: like on a trade they can dive deals 500 dmg on 1 go and go back to farm
[3:25:19] known_jester: When is smolder coming out?
[3:25:28] the_king7777777777: u dont do those kinda of pools when we vote either u gonna win or not?
[3:25:41] jadisworried: @the_king7777777777 Nah he'd win
[3:25:53] the_king7777777777: yess we want free points
[3:26:12] Rasitsu: yipiie taco playing jhinn
[3:26:18] browy_eu: Can't wait for his release and get trolled with smolder jgl

[3:32:55] V1gorous1: samira scales decent i can always just chill in lae and play for skirmishes
[3:33:18] V1gorous1: but yeah id rather play for lane
[3:34:00] Babushka__Boi_: what do you think about doing collector 1st ?
[3:34:02] usraka54: why every match is jhin/mf matchup
[3:34:13] better_call_sion: holy shit Taco is cooking his teammates
[3:34:18] KeramonX: @usraka54 bc hes playing adc
[3:34:26] VcMcGamer: okay thank you for saying it bc nobody ever  listens
[3:34:45] known_jester: Are we not the only role balanced around pro play?
[3:34:50] VcMcGamer: adc is so so difficult to carry with in soloq if your teammates don't know how to let someone else carry
[3:34:50] zek2103: they probably think you will just get 1shot by someone and be useless
[3:35:05] gurabiya: I'm about to quit trying to climb with adc, i giga win lane but some 10/2 rengar comes and wins the game without me being able to do anything about it lol
[3:35:07] kveister333: isnt samira a monster late game?
[3:35:08] blackobelisk1337: at least ziggs can just catch waves with his champ, surely he will
[3:35:20] usraka54: @KeramonX no i mean when taco plays mf enemy picks jhin when he picks jhin enemy picks mf every time i watch
[3:35:24] V1gorous1: its not rly that she scales poorly more that she has 0 range so she cant dps in the late game safely
[3:35:35] VcMcGamer: YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME
[3:35:38] KeramonX: @usraka54 could it be because theyre insanely strong champs
[3:35:45] ei_thief: lol

[3:40:44] better_call_sion: @berzerk21  She is from the proud country of Voidstan lol
[3:40:50] Miano_SEA: @Babushka__Boi_ That, is a good idea
[3:40:57] known_jester: Most of the time their too objective focused
[3:40:57] Yellow_Hawk: adc is so trash of a role
[3:41:11] Yellow_Hawk: can get ahead in lane but if enemy jung, mid, or top get ahead its over
[3:41:12] Miano_SEA: True, but Jhin good and fun though
[3:41:17] lethalbonsai: @yellow_hawk cuz you all monke
[3:41:18] Babushka__Boi_: @Miano_SEA apparently u could even dble crit with it

[3:45:15] HERME__: rooGlue
[3:45:22] Yellow_Hawk: so you do agree that adc is the least impactful role
[3:45:22] Komlin111: are junglers just bad? I just had all dragons and 3 levels up on meta junglers like rek'sai and yi as aatrox jungle
[3:45:31] Surgicalscrub: let them eat glue tho
[3:45:39] HERME__: I can see Taco carry this game
[3:45:43] blackobelisk1337: dw varus will get them next time :)
[3:45:55] lethalbonsai: @yellow_hawk its most impactful role but adc needs team to play around it
[3:46:01] MannenMedDrag: Honestly to be fair you probably dont play the best after 12h nonstop and trying AD TF, was fun tho!
[3:46:03] megadoxs: do you know for how much longer you will be streaming?
[3:46:07] better_call_sion: Adc role is like ryze

[3:49:37] Komlin111: @known_jester kalista is, I wish theyd rework her
[3:49:45] Surgicalscrub: he ded
[3:49:50] Komlin111: every time they stat buff her she becomes a broken toplaner
[3:49:58] usraka54: 444 ms
[3:50:29] known_jester: We just can't catch a break huh?
[3:50:44] Komlin111: zac was only 400g?
[3:51:12] better_call_sion: @komlin111 there are ways to fix her but she is forgotten tbh
[3:51:27] Komlin111: agree @better_call_sion
[3:51:42] better_call_sion: Vayne top on the other hand...
[3:51:44] Surgicalscrub: fidd uult down
[3:52:11] better_call_sion: Make her deal reduced q or w damage if no allies have been near her for 30 seconds
[3:53:23] better_call_sion: a wild fiddle appeared lol
[3:53:28] Surgicalscrub: all planed
[3:53:38] wonderbread1108: pyke big honor
[3:53:47] flesh_pedestrian_: That pyke was p good
[3:53:53] RealityInUse: not weakside = win
[3:53:56] known_jester: The effort you have to put in to win a masters game it disheartening
[3:53:59] manasar: Why jhin do 4444*2 execute damage to fiddle? Hidden lore?
[3:54:04] HERME__: see I NEVER doubted Taco
[3:54:08] Komlin111: topmain
[3:54:11] HERME__: 0/7
[3:54:21] Komlin111: WINNERQ
[3:54:39] imakeDMG: lazy passive talent
[3:54:47] ChiliboyN1: doesnt that mean that top is weak since it has no impact on the game if he can go 2/11 and 0///7
[3:54:50] kikkybio: top is a boring lane tbh
[3:55:12] Komlin111: idk hullbreaker sucks now
[3:55:12] guilty02: Been thinkin bout playing again so I downloaded it (been off for several seasons). Is Leona a good support currently?
[3:55:18] HappyMask91: gotta make top fun. Only play Singed
[3:55:21] ChiliboyN1: lol
[3:55:24] nyxionite: LOL
[3:55:34] RealityInUse: Jhin kills always have the 4444 execute damage popups for flavour @manasar
[3:55:37] Komlin111: I think top champions are broken but the lane itself is fine
[3:55:40] browy_eu: i play top because i want to have fun and play 1v1 duels
[3:56:02] Surgicalscrub: like by itself y
[3:56:10] Komlin111: until your jungle dies to your lane and your lane freezes on their side
[3:56:25] HERME__: @IKeepItTaco playing adc sucks. But then having this one good support once in 5 games really makes up for all the suffering
[3:56:42] HappyMask91: can't freeze against a proxy just play Singed
[3:57:00] kikkybio: @IKeepItTaco what are your thoughts on tekken 8?
[3:59:08] ChiliboyN1: how many wins you have this season

[4:00:54] Topheowomz: is there a bait item this season? I try to do axiom arc but it doesn‚Äôt really work out how I want it to, is it just me or is it bait?
[4:01:06] ChiliboyN1: is this justice in the background
[4:01:47] MannenMedDrag: Perhaps not onetrick but ‚ÄùFrappii‚Äù a french chall ADC is currently doing unranked to chall Zeri, check his YT @youngnyzro
[4:02:00] youngnyzro: @MannenMedDrag okey thank u!

[4:06:20] nyxionite: Tame Impalai :0
[4:06:23] radimier: people also love playing jhin and lethality makes him even more braindead
[4:06:26] shuffling321: Bring back deathfire touch
[4:06:33] Topheowomz: what bot lane combos are OP rn?
[4:06:45] Fun__Sized: free thinkers who needed their stat shards changed to make laning easier
[4:06:48] TouchTheCloud: It helps that Jhin is FUN to play, so he is in meta right now and people can play him without as much mastery and have success
[4:06:50] youngnyzro: Do you  guys think Zeri will be buffed soon xd?
[4:06:55] nyxionite: oh nice, Imma add it to my playlist
[4:06:58] youngnyzro: i mean she got 45% wr

[4:07:25] MannenMedDrag: She has to be kept weak cause of proplsy @youngnyzro
[4:07:36] MannenMedDrag: proplay*
[4:07:39] nyxionite: it's just Lucian Milio every single game melowo2Despair

[4:09:44] owllra: taco wholesome arc?
[4:09:56] Topheowomz: thoughts on losing galeforce?
[4:10:08] MannenMedDrag: Do you like Varus Taco? I feel he plays very similar and is versarile AF

[4:36:51] SailorPluto9: Im 0-3 on Zilean this season, its actually fked
[4:36:52] Topheowomz: I can‚Äôt tell, are you a frog, gecko, or some other animal?
[4:37:04] XChaoLanX: he is a frog
[4:37:13] XChaoLanX: RareBoi
[4:37:14] wonderbread1108: bacca and jamaican banana been hiding their minimaps recently all the time
[4:37:35] uncertainprinciples: whats ghosting?
[4:37:41] danger_cringe: what do you think about senna in this patch?
[4:37:51] wonderbread1108: @uncertainprinciples when you watch the enemy streamers stream
[4:37:56] uncertainprinciples: ah, bastards
[4:38:05] ye_olde_man: How ya doin Taco n chat ikeepitRAREBOI
[4:38:19] yellow_9797: @ikeepittaco can I ask you a question?
[4:38:21] Topheowomz: bruh how many streams do ppl have to watch then??
[4:38:24] pakrat7198: Have you ever pondered the palindrope of Tacocat? How it's spelled the same forwards and backwards?
[4:38:33] pakrat7198: It haunts me to this day
[4:38:39] lkazey: Also the win when u know they are ghosting are so satisfying
[4:38:41] wonderbread1108: cheap... there was a dude in another stream saying crap like "if the streamer is stupid enough to do it, ima do everything I can to win, durrrrrrrr"
[4:38:52] uncertainprinciples: Riot should have streamer names randomized so you cant ghost as easily. Some games do that like Escape from Tarkov for streamers i think
[4:39:18] Topheowomz: ah I thought ghosting meant dodging you in queue
[4:39:26] fafa_mora: grrrr
[4:39:33] luckyboom7: been grinding support because i feel adc is too stressful recently
[4:39:51] pakrat7198: @uncertainprinciples They should do what they do for valorant where you can choose to hide your name
[4:40:04] 7frieza: how many points on jhin? @IKeepItTaco
[4:40:20] pakrat7198: so instead of "Flash 4th Shot" it would say "Jhin #22781" or whatever
[4:40:30] Topheowomz: WILD WEST JHIN PLZ
[4:40:40] wonderbread1108: wild west jhin yes?
[4:40:54] Topheowomz: POGGERS!

[4:41:34] Anshostin: !scene
[4:41:34] Nightbot: TACO TACO TACO Friendly reminder to change scene, good luck on your game! ikeepitKOMRADEBOI @IKeepItTaco
[4:41:36] flesh_pedestrian_: DBD does,
[4:42:23] Topheowomz: nah just killem!
[4:42:30] Karsas: Taco i'm curious about something, if they asked you to give them ideas about a jhin skin, what would you tell them?
[4:43:14] Topheowomz: he has to miss 4th shot every time
[4:43:18] DShakeyX: That's genius
[4:43:19] wonderbread1108: stormtrooper cant hi... ok, makes sense

[4:45:00] kapoios8: do u buy collector?
[4:45:13] lbku: ap jhin will be fun in URF
[4:45:30] XChaoLanX: I remember back in the days when taco was hard flaming AP jhin. Now he is a believer FeelsStrongMan
[4:45:59] ratthe1: There was a hybrid ad and ap jhin
[4:46:06] ratthe1: With first strike
[4:47:24] Komlin111: olaf missed an easy axe

[4:50:34] BZsaur: gwen jg? does that work?
[4:50:35] AzureMaster_Zero: RIOT culled haste from the game, trying to take the fun away from it
[4:51:01] Komlin111: dont be hasty
[4:51:05] XChaoLanX: nah item having too much haste made the game URF lite
[4:51:20] XChaoLanX: having fewer haste items is much healthier for the game
[4:51:37] Komlin111: trading haste for raw stats is fine
[4:51:54] AzureMaster_Zero: Haste was what held the last bit of fun in game
[4:51:56] Topheowomz: damn! no remorse
[4:52:07] HoleyShirt1: ok not bad
[4:52:09] Sindriana: 4
[4:52:11] XChaoLanX: naisu
