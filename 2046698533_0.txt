[4:36:29] PekinWoof: @PekinWoof yeah bad tongue posture is mewing
[4:36:29] hoodiesits: cinnaBun
[4:36:29] Hoiranu: the normal positon is usually jjust the top of your tongue at the top, but with mewng you put it a bit foward and try to get the entire length pressing on the roof of your mouth, you can distinctly feel and see the difference
[4:36:32] Hoiranu: yapping
[4:36:35] Junkee27: anymore ekko today?
[4:36:40] DarthAchilles: Mewing: The act of crying, throwing a fit/tantrum, bitching about even the smallest things

[4:38:18] allaure: Mew Mew tbh
[4:38:21] danniethebunnie: I feel like the tip of your tongue sits against the top of your mouth normally, I always thought mewing was when you force more of your tongue to the roof of your mouth. You can feel the difference, idk why I'm physically trying to do it now lol
