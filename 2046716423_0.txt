[1:07:12] HandicappedShoes: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.

[3:01:17] guy_onthemoon: @TarkoRehin no of course not, but when you have a creature that looks like carbon copies of a Lucario, Eevee, that's different
[3:01:20] Coolsix: @Demonicown Yes, not live, but you go against other peoples builds

[3:02:26] Smoot1e: @guy_onthemoon Why do you care if the game is fun at the end of the day? OMEGALUL Didn't know Pokemon owned the Monster Catching genre
[3:02:32] gleachmoney: @omgbaph what a heartbreaking game. and now we have the most boring superbowl of all time

[5:03:41] myfirstp00p: acd so bad theyre playing hwei xdd
[5:04:00] zafironius: @HelSeKs different purposes it gives you less package dmg and less burst when going in which is kinda better for solo q with chaotic fights vs poke for pro coordinated
[5:04:02] Redfactor3: this hwei will surely get farm this game
[5:04:12] gleachmoney: -1

[5:04:51] HelSeKs: @zafironius ooh ok i see, nice point, thank u!
[5:04:56] zafironius: @zafironius also then you dont build trinity and sundered sky and you HAVE to go shojin next so you really only spike at 4 items which is way too long for solo q

[5:07:05] zafironius: @HelSeKs i dont really like it cause you cant fistfight enemies and its harder to 1 v 9 with poke
[5:07:13] In_Thee_Flesh: @ZultiaShidefy hasn't it always been 2 ap/3ap in solo Q?
