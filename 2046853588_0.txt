[3:02:40] lionx001: lol dragon forecast
[3:02:47] DirigaazMaster: I think the randomness of the drake is kinda dog shit tbh, getting an objective shouldnt feel better or worse depending on your champion imo
[3:03:06] lionx001: I think it should just go back to being gold
[3:03:34] CF9Gaming: ???????
[3:03:37] CF9Gaming: LOL
[3:03:40] BurntTo_Crisp: Oh, so that's why we're fighting
[3:04:16] khm_rican: Do you think they should make individual drakes a touch stronger so they feel more worth it to get outside of going for soul?
[3:04:22] CaptainDeston: I mean it'd be nice if it went back to just being gold (adjusted for inflation), and perhaps they just have it give a single buff like baron later in the game if they felt it needed to be relevant later on
[3:04:30] lionx001: ok make it give more gold
[3:05:37] CaptainDeston: But the map transformation idea they had and the random buffs is just meh
[3:05:57] lionx001: I hate the new inferno map
