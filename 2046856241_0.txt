[0:39:08] kkrazy1: How does stacking slows work in league? If a champion is affected by multiple slows, the strongest one will be fully applied, while the others are applied sequentially with 65% reduced effectiveness down to 35% of its original strength. Slow effects derived from items' passives do NOT stack, even when coming from different champions
[0:39:11] kjeweller: honestly the old bork was much better for ADCs
