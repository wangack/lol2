[0:11:15] madiiiman: I'm not okay
[0:11:21] Giiino: the lions just cant have nice things
[0:11:32] madiiiman: why does god hate the lions
[0:11:37] Exedra711: Exedra711 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! cristoTSM
[0:11:41] Uberblacktorne: greetings monte and chat
[0:11:46] Giiino: at least they have the pistons in detroit Kappa
[0:12:14] Phaetox: Lions did kill a lot of Christians to be fair
[0:12:14] madiiiman: Also I can't stand everyone hating on dan campbell... the Lions only got where they were because of his aggression. This was always a possibility... live by it, die by it
[0:12:17] Uberblacktorne: wow, that looks good... and healthy O_o
[0:12:22] fatalqwerty: looks healthy as hell, are veggies cheap in korea?

[0:12:41] dgonsays: t1 game***
[0:12:43] Exedra711: agreed dgon
[0:12:45] madiiiman: Brock Purdy better finish off the Chiefs to make up for this
[0:12:50] PlaygroundRS: @madiiiman ye, it was that compounded by what happened with the fumble and that facemask ball that was caught lol
[0:12:57] dgonsays: i call em like i see em monte
[0:13:03] Blackreignxxx: sr vs c9 not a banger... just vulcan inting
[0:13:09] colonelsoap: doesn't T1 pretty often humble a bit in the beginning of the season?
[0:13:44] madiiiman: @PlaygroundRS 2 different Reynolds fucked up 3 different game altering plays... Josjh dropped the 4th down and a 3rd down. Craig lost the onside kick
[0:13:54] 2916nick: monte can i have a bite
[0:13:55] Blackreignxxx: i do like insanity but vulcan needs to be in jail after that game
[0:14:08] madiiiman: I was actually shocked Dan went for the 3 points before half
[0:14:15] madiiiman: I was positive they wud try for 7
[0:14:19] Amosdragon: From Bangers Only to Bangers Mostly
[0:14:21] XLOftw: Monte, serious question: considering your wife is Korean, what name you guys chose for your kids? Korean or American? xD
[0:14:22] Blackreignxxx: criminal match fixing behavior
[0:14:28] PlaygroundRS: ye the two drops werent great. i can sorta see with the one low and away. but the 3rd down in the bread basket was like ouch. then deciding not to kick the FG after all the other events that occured, shocking
[0:14:29] 2916nick: zaitooOCK zaitooOCK
[0:14:41] Exedra711: RaccAttack Clap we love such quality
[0:14:46] electedhat006: espically into the fumble right after
[0:14:50] madiiiman: Brock Purdy devil magic
[0:14:55] madiiiman: ive never seen anything like it
[0:15:06] Exedra711: they do just gotta refresh
[0:15:07] PlaygroundRS: @madiiiman ye same here
[0:15:15] Blackreignxxx: t1 hle game 1 was a banger
[0:15:21] Giiino: as long as you tried your best thats ok
[0:15:30] madiiiman: I am actually a Brock Purdy believer, but after this game even I cannot deny the kid ALSO has a magic horseshoe up his ass
[0:15:32] madiiiman: that was absurd
[0:15:35] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: it worked for a second, but it wenyt away even after refreshing
[0:16:01] Blackreignxxx: jdg ra was good too. ruler made lucian look viable
[0:16:09] wryjester: Is this game 1?

[0:16:44] madiiiman: unfortunately i think that the catch didnt matter because the picked up penalty was likely DPI
[0:16:59] madiiiman: they just picked it up cuz it didnt matter
[0:17:03] dgonsays: DansGame
[0:17:15] TwiceTSTS: Lucian in general looks much better in eastern regions
[0:17:31] CielAstraea_exe: so monte doesnt watch the games until the next day
[0:17:32] CielAstraea_exe: jithaeL
[0:17:34] madiiiman: Josh Reynolds has no hands
[0:17:54] Blackreignxxx: its because eastern teams are using lucian well because of the prio it gives
[0:17:58] Blackreignxxx: which western teams cant
[0:18:09] dgonsays: it only took me 2 banned accounts to reform
[0:18:26] fateofcain: mmm
[0:18:27] madiiiman: All my favorite players turbo inted in the NFL. Derrick Henry has the best 3 year stretch we've seen in decades and the Titan's waste it too...
[0:18:32] CielAstraea_exe: @dgonsays this game brings out the best in us :)
[0:18:34] Gondawn: Thanks, now I am hungry
[0:18:34] fatalqwerty: Kreygasm making me feel hungry man
[0:19:06] fatalqwerty: There are Costcos in korea now? wow
[0:19:07] fateofcain: now do the Hello Fresh plug after making everyone hungry <.<
[0:19:11] madiiiman: Fun fact, if the 49ers win, Brock Purdy has identical playoff resume to  Patrick Mahomes after 2 years... with a head to head victory... making him better O.o
[0:19:11] timmonsontwitch: enjoying the amount of content coming out
[0:19:11] Lamynator: damn, didn't know Costco was outside the US, that's amazing
[0:19:15] fljqpy: some BANGERS yesterday
[0:19:15] Giiino: kirkland for life
[0:19:31] colonelsoap: welcome to the costco fold.
[0:19:36] fateofcain: Kirkland is incredible
[0:19:36] TwiceTSTS: I made a similar sandwich but with gluten free bread. Home made pesto is awesome
[0:19:54] CielAstraea_exe: @MonteCristo hey monte, is t1 better now or are they relatively at the same power level when they ended worlds
[0:19:54] fatalqwerty: KC vs SK Yessss RaccAttack Clap
[0:19:58] madiiiman: Zeus was simultaneously a terrorist and hero in this game. Never seen anything quite like it
[0:20:06] Blackreignxxx: wbg game was a banger
[0:20:11] XLOftw: is there a surprise pick in this series?
[0:20:22] Sagemcdonald: Monte, do you get offers to be a coach for LoL pro teams?
[0:20:25] madiiiman: @XLOftw yes Zeus picks yone. unprecidented
[0:20:29] fljqpy: skip them LUL
[0:20:36] XLOftw: yone niceee
[0:20:45] Phixos2: faker champion pool lol
[0:20:47] madiiiman: faker makes neeko look beyond broken
[0:20:50] Phixos2: these champions are meta
[0:20:53] Condimental: I'm waiting for the Mash stream of terrible games where Monte roasts everyone and everything
[0:21:18] madiiiman: Kappa
[0:21:21] fljqpy: they were worried of kalista neeko eh
[0:21:23] madiiiman: blind aatrox into Zeus

[0:21:40] madiiiman: Zeus "how many times do I have to teach you this leson old man?"
[0:21:45] Pep_bardiola: @madiiiman doran still played well tho
[0:21:59] madiiiman: @Pep_bardiola he did, but zeus just shit on his entire team when it mattered
[0:22:09] Pep_bardiola: Well it's zeus
[0:22:16] fljqpy: well its yone
[0:22:16] madiiiman: being even with yone in lane isnt enough
[0:22:20] madiiiman: you shut it down or it beats you
[0:22:29] Pep_bardiola: Ye
[0:22:50] Exedra711: personally do not like nocturne in this meta
[0:23:00] Sagemcdonald: Why doesn't HLE just pick a toxic support like Brand into the Ashe?
[0:23:03] madiiiman: ive seen enough zeus yone to know it doesnt matter what happens until he has botrk and 1 more item. at tht point, its just over
[0:23:04] Exedra711: ive seen enough and im neverr convinced
[0:23:07] Pep_bardiola: When will we see the zeka akali
[0:23:09] Phaetox: Yeah idk who told zeka he was a corki player
[0:23:10] Pep_bardiola: Lmao

[0:23:26] fljqpy: to disappoint
[0:23:31] madiiiman: faker's neeko clone kalista ghost tech in this game is disgusting
[0:23:33] zen__cloud: is hob corki actually viable?
[0:23:44] madiiiman: wait hwy the fuck does corki have hail of blades?
[0:23:45] Exedra711: standard keria ashe things
[0:24:02] madiiiman: keria ghost is interesting. he mainly uses barrier to trade at level 1
[0:24:26] madiiiman: idk if ive ever seen him use ghost before
[0:25:07] dowiet: i am here to report a murder and it isn't for t1
[0:25:24] fljqpy: i love poppy too
[0:25:29] XLOftw: kalista with the new potion rune Kreygasm

[0:25:37] gizzardd__: i miss old poppy BibleThump
[0:25:44] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo why do you think zeka has hob?
[0:25:58] madiiiman: i still remember monte raving about the "sexual thrills of lolipoppy"
[0:25:59] Zelgius: Zeka will make sure that winrate won't survive

[0:27:08] fljqpy: "leaving the scene" LUL
[0:27:11] Giiino: @onestepstroke this is a pesto chicken channel now sir
[0:27:12] Zelgius: Not manamune/malignance lol
[0:27:14] madiiiman: i want to find that old clip of you and doa but im not googling "sexual thrills of lollipoppy" to find it
[0:28:14] madiiiman: its game 2 where zeus just runs at peanut and doral level 1 at blue buff right?
[0:28:24] fljqpy: @madiiiman just use your imagination Kreygasm
[0:28:36] Exedra711: triforce is not the best on this patch because sundered sky titanic bork exist

[0:29:07] Phixos2: the ocean is really just a big lake tbh
[0:29:10] kingruben7: ok bro
[0:29:14] zen__cloud: baron travels from the dragon river side to its pit
[0:29:16] Zelgius: Wasn't there a waterfall on the edge of the map at some point?
[0:29:19] MrTeapot: maybe the salmon knows teleport?
[0:29:30] FoofaRice: If I recall isn't summoners rift a super high floating island?
[0:29:42] madiiiman: they knew too cuz he pulled the trigger immediately
[0:29:44] Gondawn: How did tether not break there?
[0:29:51] unknowm22: Jax love fishing in the river
[0:29:51] Phaetox: It's a spring fed river and the salmon are factory farmed there
[0:29:56] madiiiman: @Gondawn noc tether has a very slight delay before breaking
[0:30:01] xiBOOSTix: Are all the games today 1 game series?
[0:30:05] madiiiman: i meant oner knew

[0:33:14] dgonsays: NO zugzug
[0:33:17] Adanion: player of the year Monte, player of the year
[0:33:20] fistigons25: zeka had some of the most disgusting Corki plays in this series

[0:35:57] GelatoSquid: C9 vs SR is not a banger Despairge
[0:36:00] that_guy_who_games: Monte these arent a banger YOU are the banger
[0:36:05] Phaetox: Zeka can be useful just gotta know how to use him but corki aint it
[0:36:17] Zelgius: This series was not much of a banger thanks to the double corki

[0:41:26] madiiiman: do we know if HLe saw what we saw on the minimap when faker turned into the kalista ghost?
[0:41:30] that_guy_who_games: VoidGrubs feel a bit too over tuned in comparison to early drags
[0:41:33] madiiiman: cuz if so they had to wonder what th eMASSIVE white box was
[0:41:49] lennyiswise: @waynevanilla yes because you dont have to work on team rapport

[1:24:56] joeshang: ye he had a bit more than half
[1:25:00] TheMommik: nvm, 3/4 of timer
[1:25:09] l0st3560: ye I’m not gonna be blaming him too much in the review for this one
[1:25:12] Ghost_of_Dividion: the gold border shows the timer on the skill as well
[1:25:33] TheMommik: that's why we pop the potions early, kids
[1:25:33] LevKester: that red pot actually got zeus the kill
[1:25:36] bestplat_tftplayer: nope it was all calculated by Zeus
[1:25:37] 그렘린1201: unlucky
[1:26:19] Ghost_of_Dividion: if zeus held w for another fraction of a second he has shield longer and lives i think
[1:26:39] homelander369: Dont look at mid cs

[1:27:37] LordAnomandaris: Zeka is getting exposed in this meta. If it is not Akali / Sylas meta then he is not on the level of the top mids
[1:27:41] Exedra711: misplayed lane then on his reset got chunked by keria and its just over

[2:05:36] Zoogs: @MonteCristo Am I wrong in concluding that the Asian regions spearhead more meta standards and if so, why is that?
[2:05:40] FannyBabbs: yeah is it also reducing karma ult cooldown on tick too? seems busto
[2:05:50] Zelgius: Not even a handful of champs can use malignance+eclipse so they missed it

[2:11:47] fIuffee: monte is SUCH a slytherin

[2:25:19] Melkerull: xin damage
[2:25:26] Exedra711: Clean from bo
[2:25:36] clmft1: I was looking at the subreddit for KC games last week and everyone was saying Bo is shit but now the narrative seems to have changed obviously. No idea why this guy gets hate to be honest, he is doing great considering his team
[2:25:52] exodia0077: wow aatrox got obliterated
[2:26:00] DazyLave: titanic op

[2:27:40] zionsick: Yamato must be happy
[2:27:42] clmft1: @Exedra711 That's true. The thing I dislike is the constant narrative shift about players. They simply can't understand that a player can be good even in a shit team
[2:27:56] Birbmang_: ok now get targamas the fuck out please
[2:28:06] Birbmang_: he inted the lane again this game
[2:28:13] Zelgius: Are the comms for this one available?
[2:28:16] burningtruths: Teamfights are also very straightforward with this comp; ez engages with Rakhan/Neeko and then you just go in Equaliser on everyone
[2:28:26] burningtruths: that prolly helped a team that was struggling to play together
[2:28:28] Mykah9: is that really the big difference between top teams and bottom teams the decision to go in or not?

[2:55:48] dgonsays: for my USA brain
[2:55:49] najafan: TIP with subs beat C9, never forget.
[2:55:55] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Would it have been better if Jojo counties to try to kill soin instead of going for milo
[2:55:57] DazyLave: RaccAttack
[2:55:59] Fissiccisst: RaccAttack Clap
[2:56:03] l0st3560: tessir
[2:56:03] StuntmanStan: mentalgen
[2:56:05] zionsick: Racoons is the way
[2:56:10] stormwolf744: RaccAttack True
[2:56:10] colonelsoap: that will make me sub
[2:56:13] IEatLamas: How can players at this lvl not precipitate these events and flash earlier
[2:56:16] saltywalty1337: yep
[2:56:42] AzureCatalyst: Woop here's my free bezos bucks Monte
[2:56:47] TheMommik: We're gonna have snobs vs raccoons fightoff and in the end snobby raccoons will prove to be the most numerous
[2:56:47] AzureCatalyst: AzureCatalyst subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:57:04] DazyLave: blaber kinda troll build
[2:57:19] saltywalty1337: They have so much range? Facepalm
[2:57:23] Daelo42: MC will always be the boss toss of my heart, Monte.
[2:57:30] proneisbeast: if your cocaster said that, would you disagree or talk to them after about it
[2:57:32] Ghost_of_Dividion: yeah pretty bad casting
[2:57:44] unclemiketheinformant: how is vayne supposed to fight this game with zero front line?
[2:57:50] SnowKayn: not gonna lie you are right he's wrong
[2:57:51] colonelsoap: maokai: i need to do damage to try to trick them to buy MR
[2:57:52] juan_juario: Raafa is still in training HahaShrugMiddle
[2:57:56] SnowKayn: just straight up
[2:57:56] fljqpy: vayne IS the frontline
[2:58:00] Nekor_: Thats low Range in my Book
[2:58:11] DazyLave: thats where you're wrong about vulcan KEKW
[2:58:12] epicalbawler: oh vulcans gonna walk up alright
[2:58:13] SnowKayn: really bad analysis and deserves the flame
[2:58:22] Rgb14: that little chicken pathing was weird
[2:58:23] SnowKayn: Casters wonder why people flame them when they have takes like that
[2:58:26] Prepo9: "youre not going to walk up with Vulcan" Oh just you wait...
[2:58:36] saltywalty1337: maokai does build ap and become paper too
[2:58:39] unclemiketheinformant: Maokai E can do that easily
[2:58:44] FuHua_HoS: i mean, you have kalista ghost and maokai sapling
[2:58:44] kraethan: Is the agruement that they just have more range? Casuse varus only real range on SR?
[2:59:16] killerpineapple1: dont his hp make his saplings last longer too
[2:59:18] najafan: Except Lilia and Sion both have poke, so it's just not true.
[2:59:28] unclemiketheinformant: Yeah, they have no engage with Vayne and Kalista. So how do they even play the fucking game without a beefy boy?
[2:59:53] SnowKayn: maokai is a lot weaker this season for sure
[3:00:13] unclemiketheinformant: Maokai is a super good support this season but mediocre jungler
[3:00:14] Alphz: what the fuck
[3:00:18] Naxser: @MonteCristo there is a equivalent to demonic embrace with the new items but not so broken, but you can still do the same with melee champions
[3:00:20] zionsick: Inssanity is holding up nicely in CS
[3:00:33] Melkerull: just wait :)

[3:00:43] najafan: Midlane is over
[3:00:43] zionsick: for a vayne, I mean
[3:00:49] Ghost_of_Dividion: bro/drx was a certified banger
[3:01:13] esr_140: Lm
[3:01:31] Melkerull: this dive :)
[3:01:32] Zionyx25: I think going lethality aatrox here is criminal
[3:01:35] SnowKayn: Kalista pick ain't it
[3:01:57] Kufner: zeus does it so im sure he thinks hes good enough
[3:02:00] SnowKayn: Sundered sky is so broken
[3:02:00] zionsick: wtf
[3:02:04] fortant69: a classic north american tower dive
[3:02:07] ThatLatvianGuy: RaccAttack Clap
[3:02:08] Melkerull: just wait for minions LuL
[3:02:09] Alphz: 3 tanks better go letality right
[3:02:10] saltywalty1337: flash w maokai so badddd
[3:02:10] SnowKayn: why wouldn't you go bruiser aatrox
[3:02:15] SnowKayn: man this is hard to watch
[3:02:16] epicalbawler: this was a dive of all time
[3:02:16] IEatLamas: ........
[3:02:17] xonsa: oh god my eyes
[3:02:17] Karego: what is this dive tho
[3:02:25] dgonsays: BANGERS ONLY
[3:02:29] dgonsays: BETTER THAN DRX VS BRO
[3:02:30] fljqpy: CLOWN9

[3:02:31] Rgb14: bannngggerrsssss only
[3:02:32] IEatLamas: PROPLAY
[3:02:37] Elbluntdealer: tragedies only
[3:02:37] naocorrijo: worst dive of all time lol
[3:02:39] fortant69: well c9 did get banged on
[3:02:39] SnowKayn: yea thats game ending there esp for a kalista lane
[3:02:41] Tpro83: RaccAttack This tastes GREAT! RaccAttack
[3:02:42] hibbjibb: @dgonsays Lord Morgan would never
[3:02:43] hairykintama: Dont look mid  cs
[3:02:44] IEatLamas: He get's payed to do that dive
[3:02:46] saltywalty1337: its joever after this
[3:02:48] Exedra711: Puke all over the keyboard
[3:02:48] AntiquusTonitrus_3: I got to shower after seeing that lol
[3:02:54] Alphz: the 10% hp dive
[3:02:56] Alphz: based
[3:02:56] colonelsoap: RaccAttack
[3:03:01] epicalbawler: the wave wasnt even in yet
[3:03:02] Kufner: @hairykintama who cares about csd when its melee v ranged
[3:03:08] spucky117: thy have a sion that can come back to life even if you kill him
[3:03:12] saltywalty1337: mao ult before wave crash
[3:03:16] najafan: TP was irrelevant, it was doomed anyhow
[3:03:20] Zampeh_: Did tp even do anything? The dive was actually so bad it barely mattered
[3:03:23] zanchu: W drops aggro
[3:03:27] unclemiketheinformant: the flash doesnt
[3:03:28] zionsick: How?
[3:03:29] Karego: isnt it twisted advance
[3:03:30] unclemiketheinformant: the W does
[3:03:31] Karego: that drops it
[3:03:33] Zionyx25: W
[3:03:35] Exedra711: W drops aggro
[3:03:35] kraethan: I think its the w that drops aggro
[3:03:37] zionsick: I thought it was the root
[3:03:53] Double_Hitt: why didnt they wait for the wave?
[3:03:56] zanchu: zerker didn't cleanse root either
[3:03:59] jerckysminion: well that's a disaster
[3:04:01] Taka149: W drops aggro
[3:04:03] xonsa: yes
[3:04:06] unclemiketheinformant: i mean, he had to or maokai does and then kalista dies anyway
[3:04:07] killerpineapple1: he didnt even have to tp
[3:04:09] RomanticCreampie: 100%
[3:04:10] unclemiketheinformant: shit play
[3:04:11] killerpineapple1: he say in interview after lol
[3:04:13] unclemiketheinformant: shit region
[3:04:13] PPatrolka: @MonteCristo  Sion ult for style points
[3:04:14] kraethan: Meanwhile void grubs by lillia
[3:04:17] zionsick: You need to make an statement, so Sion was necessary, yes
[3:04:17] fortant69: ive seen cleaner tower dives in solo queue
[3:04:17] unclemiketheinformant: shit team
[3:04:19] najafan: Nah, TP was irrelevant, only gives cc for that third one, it was already over.
[3:04:29] Taka149: Style points
[3:04:32] Birbmang_: is he going profane on aatrox? that build fucking sucks tbh
[3:04:39] killerpineapple1: well he spell books it out
[3:04:50] blargh4: sion tp was a waste tbh
[3:04:54] killerpineapple1: thats on jojo tbh
[3:04:57] hairykintama: a winning udyr into aatrox lane? lck could never
[3:04:57] saltywalty1337: switches to tp on spellbook right before dive
[3:05:03] Melkerull: @MonteCristo the should delay the dive as well, minions weren't in range
[3:05:05] killerpineapple1: jojo had vision of him doing it
[3:05:26] killerpineapple1: and seemed to not make the call quickly enough or even knew it was happening
[3:05:30] kraethan: Oh hey, they added the grub counter on the overlay
[3:05:39] Exedra711: I think they clean up anyway

[3:05:49] Kiwislap: they just forced it way too hard
[3:05:49] jerckysminion: that was foolish taking aggro so fast
[3:05:54] zionsick: oh yeah they didn't wait for the fkn minions
[3:05:59] Pergrim: holy
[3:06:01] killerpineapple1: in the moment you TP
[3:06:04] Exedra711: Correct
[3:06:04] killerpineapple1: 110%
[3:06:07] AntiquusTonitrus_3: They said kilasta had the w on her XD
[3:06:08] zionsick: Yeah that makes sense
[3:06:10] unclemiketheinformant: HOW DO YOU NOT WAIT FOR FUCKING MINIONS. MY GOD!
[3:06:10] Taka149: Unlucky
[3:06:11] jerckysminion: u gotta be a moron to go in without waiting for the minions
[3:06:12] xonsa: varus was 20 cs behind too
[3:06:17] Rgb14: tp starts to make you hesitate
[3:06:19] chancethewaterdog: !vods

[3:06:20] najafan: Sure. It was reasonable, but didn't end up mattering.
[3:06:34] walruslube: Do you think its game over after that dive?
[3:06:52] killerpineapple1: @najafan you dont expect 3v2 dives to come out in your favor anymore it was just bad
[3:07:20] saltywalty1337: loss deserved after that dive @MonteCristo
[3:07:22] burdil3z: the point is the arrogance to play vayne mid to a team 0-3 for what? to make clear they are way better? zzz
[3:07:25] Kufner: i wouldnt say gameover in any na anything is possible
[3:07:32] fartnugget45: its not game over from a game state sense but idk how you dont mental boom after a play like that lol
[3:07:33] SnowKayn: @walruslube it is imo for kalista lane
[3:07:35] xonsa: liandrys first item? he cant tank shit
[3:07:36] Exedra711: Its like 75 25 in favour of sr after that
[3:07:38] Kufner: buts a mound to battle
[3:07:39] hairykintama: @burdil3z vayne mid destroyed lane
[3:07:43] DazyLave: what should aatrox be building this game?
[3:07:45] najafan: @killerpineapple1 I think there's an argument that it was a mistake since it by the time the TP started it was already 2v2. But we can nitpick this all day in hindsight. In the moment it's sooooo much harder to make these decisions.
[3:07:48] maletroll: That Mao build with no tank on team is so bad
[3:08:02] Exedra711: Because they really cant afford to get behind with this low range comp
[3:08:02] fljqpy: same gold, 6 grubs for 2 drakes, game is even
[3:08:20] IEatLamas: He's going AP maokai...?
[3:08:26] jerckysminion: yeah butthat mid is way ahead
[3:08:37] najafan: Only AP on the team
[3:08:44] Zoraion: Good day, Monte! How are you doing today?
[3:08:46] Birbmang_: profane on aatrox is fake
[3:08:46] jerckysminion: although it is jojo i mean
[3:08:53] Zionyx25: Aatrox will be completely worthless lmao
[3:08:56] unclemiketheinformant: They just played this game disrespectfully. AP Mao, Vayne mid, Lethality Aatrox. C9 isn't good enough to be this arrogant.
[3:08:58] burdil3z: @hairykintama its not about a lane bro, its a team comp
[3:09:00] killerpineapple1: @killerpineapple1 theres a bit of a delay when you change spells out with book as soon as he swapped it insta tped bot was following teammates calls so thats hella good on instanity your speaking in retrospect
[3:09:19] najafan: It's aatrox that's the real itemization sin.
[3:09:24] Exedra711: @birbmang_ profane is a fine item just not in this game
[3:09:28] Badseed31: but he is the only ap
[3:09:45] zionsick: bramble
[3:09:51] Birbmang_: @Exedra711 every time i see profane aatrox it loses hard and does nothing sundered sky and eclipse are just both better items for him
[3:10:06] Melkerull: 6 grubs monkaHmm
[3:10:07] hairykintama: Fudge ccant play aatrox
[3:10:09] xonsa: vulcan takes the kill yikes
[3:10:10] IEatLamas: @Badseed31 Mao will do magic dmg still it's fine
[3:10:18] spucky117: only zeus can do lethality A-ATR0X
[3:10:26] najafan: @killerpineapple1 Of course, we can only evaluate in retrospect. I'm explicitly saying that it was reasonable from the time it was made, just maybe not ideal.
[3:10:27] hairykintama: zeus would win vs udyr
[3:10:36] unclemiketheinformant: jojo played this game like it was a 1v1 vs Sion. LOLOLOL
[3:10:42] Sorain_lol: fakegod shoulda saved awaken for unstoppable for that dive i think

[3:10:44] Birbmang_: aatrox into udyr is also kinda fake
[3:10:48] hairykintama: look at kt vs t1. Aatrox lane should have won but it lost
[3:10:49] GelatoSquid: I can't tell if cloud9 were hungover or still drunk
[3:10:50] CaptMalReynolds: This was an embarrassing showing from C9.
[3:10:51] killerpineapple1: @killerpineapple1 fair enough!
[3:10:59] xSavage_Kid510x: zeyzal has the insider strats info
[3:11:10] Exedra711: @birbmang_ gotta isolate play from the build - in this game it doesnt make sense
[3:11:21] Professional_Aellith: Shopify: We deliver products and wins.
[3:11:36] hairykintama: FakeGod is real
[3:11:36] Birbmang_: @Exedra711 the thing is profane never really makes sense on aatrox imo, profane is good on champs that insta combo someone under 50%
[3:11:43] Badseed31: wave clear seems really important this patch
[3:11:59] fljqpy: c9 trying to innovate yall
[3:11:59] Birbmang_: but fudge can buy anything this game and be useless
[3:12:10] DazyLave: azael just has a mega boner for c9
[3:12:25] lordkeram: @Exedra711 No. Profane is insane on Aatrox. Just this game it would be better if Aatrox played frontline for Vayne and Kalista.
[3:12:27] IEatLamas: Is trist a better pick than vayne into this?
[3:12:33] Birbmang_: yeah sundering/cleaver/eclipse would all serve him more
[3:12:35] arthradot: uselessness is a spectrum
[3:12:45] kraethan: I wonder if some of the reasoning from azael is a subconcious assumption that c9 is better and so must be more correct.
[3:13:17] fljqpy: why wouldnt u assume that
[3:13:23] RomanticCreampie: love seeing shit like sion mid winning, reminds me of those crazy ls drafts
[3:13:31] spucky117: azael was completely out of pocket for lots of todays cast
[3:13:55] xonsa: fudge should have plant to back line no?
[3:14:04] Birbmang_: become enlightened and just mute the casters as they are almost always wrong about everything
[3:14:17] Loxi9: is it me or does vayne just not kill tanks i feel like thats such a myth
[3:14:27] fortant69: with fudges items wouldnt he just get 1 shot trying to flank that?
[3:14:39] Badseed31: fudge did nothing that fight
[3:14:51] maletroll: Vayne does shred tanks but she needs an angle to hit them
[3:14:53] burdil3z: GENG don't think to play vayne mid againt BRO bc they have codes
[3:14:53] kraethan: Well his job is to be objective and problvide analysis, so he should try to do so without bias (not realistically possible, but should try)
[3:15:03] Tpro83: Did Mao W stop Sion R?
[3:15:10] blackisgood365: Fudge never does anything.
[3:15:26] Birbmang_: i am so ready for fudge fiora at msi running it down
[3:15:26] TheMommik: @kraethan Nah, he can be biased, but still needs to be accurate
[3:15:42] jerckysminion: should of backed off
[3:15:54] Exedra711: @birbmang_ realistically though, i only like lethality aatrox so he shouldnt even be in this game
[3:15:54] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:15:55] saltywalty1337: BECAUSE BVOY HAS THE RANGE
[3:16:08] fljqpy: they didnt get to go in wcyd
[3:16:09] xonsa: or milio doing 3 times aatrox dmg
[3:16:10] Professional_Aellith: Damn, Fudge got packed
[3:16:10] Fissiccisst: bvoy brought the gun to the knife fight
[3:16:21] fljqpy: cant hit bcos too busy running away
[3:16:21] Karego: I get the vayne pick was for fun, but why not just azir?
[3:16:32] CaptMalReynolds: Was there any logic behind C9s draft?
[3:16:34] drdipshet: oo good timing i missed this game
[3:16:37] jerckysminion: bvoy brings a shotgun to a fistfight
[3:16:38] spucky117: i usually mute all but lck casters... and top tier eu/lcs ones ... missing quickshot and rivington
[3:16:42] blackisgood365: Good thing it's bo1. So that if you mess up draft you don't have a chance to redeem yourself from possible rng mistakes
[3:16:47] zanchu: idk did they just expect to roll lane and never teamfight
[3:16:48] LilGimli: think c9 just tunneled on the sion vayne counter
[3:16:48] burdil3z: @Karego arrogance
[3:16:48] Birbmang_: also this is totally an aftershock full tank maokai game no?
[3:16:49] DazyLave: maokai build becoming even more criminal
[3:16:52] Sorain_lol: who would actually hit varus if you could re draft this draft
[3:16:53] colorblindgenius: bvoy brings a nuclear warhead to a chess game
[3:17:02] serawrbear: @spucky117 rivington is the worst caster ever though i'm so confused
[3:17:04] Exedra711: @birbmang_ would be full ad
[3:17:10] IEatLamas: She's reaching her peak DatSheffy
[3:17:19] Birbmang_: @Exedra711 yeah but with vayne at least you can play some fights
[3:17:20] fljqpy: siege without baron LUL 6 grubs so good
[3:17:27] Melkerull: vulcan lmao
[3:17:43] jerckysminion: be burned alive scrublords
[3:17:45] Double_Hitt: grubs need a buff
[3:17:49] Exedra711: @birbmang_ vayne takes too long and some tank items are too strong, too hard for vayne to play fights
[3:17:50] IEatLamas: I wish caster would trash on the players more in lcs maybe they'd be shamed into playing better
[3:17:59] Its_Just_Andy: KEKW
[3:18:08] spucky117: play the clown music
[3:18:15] xonsa: their only chance is if varus kills his own team for them
[3:18:17] Rgb14: what a banger kekw
[3:18:22] SomeFerretGuy: @IEatLamas people cry when they do that they cry when they don't
[3:18:24] DazyLave: @IEatLamas that's why dom exists
[3:18:24] colorblindgenius: @IEatLamas i mean this is a draft diff tho
[3:18:45] jerckysminion: oh look he noticed :p
[3:19:07] torgoat: vulcant LOL
[3:19:08] Professional_Aellith: Washed up solo queue champions against a team with everything on the line. I’m amazed C9 got as far as they did.
[3:19:14] Fried_Doge: is insanity just the best midlaner in NA this year?
[3:19:16] saltywalty1337: soon maokai will tickle them
[3:19:20] saltywalty1337: his ratios are bad
[3:19:21] ThatLatvianGuy: respect to SR for not losing their brain and finishing the game, better than previous bottom lcs teams
[3:19:27] najafan: @Hmisay Nice bait.
[3:19:34] blackisgood365: They need to make haunting guise passive unique.  Stacking masks is so dumb
[3:19:45] Exedra711: I think haunting guise isnt unique so its actually strong in isolation
[3:19:46] aoersie: Takeaway from this game: Jojo ain't Caps
[3:19:52] lordkeram: I love how they might maybe be able to do something if they have a frontline, but both Blaber and Fudge are going full damage builds :D
[3:19:53] Exedra711: Lot of the teemo mains abuse it
[3:19:54] jerckysminion: LUL
[3:19:55] IEatLamas: @IEatLamas honesty is the way
[3:20:04] jerckysminion: vulcan just got destroyed
[3:20:08] ThatLatvianGuy: @aoersie https://twitter.com/jojopyunlol/status/1751722259734319459
[3:20:15] saltywalty1337: "how does this sion/udyr engage?" --Azael
[3:20:20] unknown87644: did jojo cleanse anything there
[3:20:26] jerckysminion: jojopyun can't do shit

[3:46:08] commando1814: @fatalqwerty we know Thorin would help doa would just not care
[3:46:27] commando1814: papa ? not sure

[3:49:46] archie7497: @commando1814 don't think noc. But lee, graves, xin I've seen
[3:49:47] lordkeram: Is it just me or does that play never work if you don't have the Q to follow up on ult?
[3:50:06] slothX0: caps hit more E in the first 10 min then saken + perkz during their games
[3:50:33] lordkeram: @LZA93 Nah if anything they came back because of creative plays into two games they should have lost from draft.
[3:50:49] mjoll_the_hotness: humanoid should be leading but i think hes more of a memer than leader

[3:53:36] commando1814: is this @lordkeram are the all 5 shot callers they have none style ?
[3:54:03] fljqpy: actual REplay LUL just the same footage
[3:54:15] fljqpy: with the RTS point of view
[3:54:34] Rgb14: lck does multi obs right?
[3:54:53] najafan: Looking at Mikyx's health would be quality added, for instance.
[3:54:59] Taka149: Saving those pennies
[3:54:59] najafan: But we just don't know the exact number
[3:55:09] handygamer: Having worked in the German Collegiate scene for some years, including with some of the Riot obs at the time, I was baffled by their decision. Unbelievable loss of production quality @MonteCristo
[3:55:19] najafan: Or watching Corki as he TPed
[3:55:20] fljqpy: feels like auto camera tbh
[3:55:33] fljqpy: just pan over the action

[3:57:10] Sniper13x: I watched Office Space so I know middle management is crucial
[3:57:10] rico149: Are there any articles or press releases about those cuts to LEC ?
[3:57:11] zionsick: Management rarely gets fired
[3:57:12] offcorser: Ud with so many less workers theyd need less managers monkaHmm
[3:57:16] commando1814: waaaait - is riot esports fucking office space ?
[3:57:29] commando1814: what would you say you doooooo here
[3:57:30] Hardrocklife: Would it be better or worse if they asked for donations?
[3:57:31] lordkeram: Oh yeah the classic. Management needs to save their jobs so instead of doing a good job they fire someone else :D
[3:57:31] fatalqwerty: G2 came there to die
[3:57:34] fljqpy: i remember one time seeing some dude doing an AI obs/casting for a lol game
[3:57:39] zionsick: is the people doing the work how gets fired, the management gets a pat on the back saying good job for saving money to the corp. I guess
[3:57:49] slammer_hammer: mikyx hooks the wall at the start
[3:57:49] Branado: Miky hooked the wall
[3:57:55] lolznaga: You can't fire management, though. Without management, how would we know who to fire?
[3:57:59] Finfen: I feel like there’s no way LEC made that decision by themselves, no? They upgraded everything, studio, casting team and co-streamer booths, only to lay off most of their crew week 2 of the first split @montecristo ? That feels like someone higher up got upset they did those things.
[3:58:00] NaughtyShrink: did you see miky's hook? KEKW
[3:58:00] fatalqwerty: G2 felt like the game wasn't exciting enough so they had to make the game close
[3:58:04] commando1814: @zionsick riot is a godamn South Park episode jesus

[3:59:19] fatalqwerty: they said that while sniffing an envelope filled with money lmao
[3:59:22] zionsick: @commando1814 Is not only Riot, is just every  software company, doesn't matter if is games or whatever

[4:02:09] lordkeram: @mjoll_the_hotness nami wasn't banned, but it's not better or worse just slightly different angles
[4:02:10] Finfen: Because they never dash forwards on Lucian. You kinda need your lane to play like psychos. Same as with Cait.
[4:02:11] fatalqwerty: Not only to Zeka, but most of the corki mids in LCS and LEC tbh monte
[4:02:22] irdi19: Did we watch kc banger @montecristo

[4:20:25] kayywang: Hey monte, I will be going to Seoul for the first time This March.  I'm not Korean nor know any Korean, will english only be fine?
[4:20:27] IEatLamas: Just like a certain someone had to vs Orianna earlier.   Idk I like Corki but only in some comps that allow him some safety
[4:20:36] fljqpy: sounds tough
[4:20:40] fljqpy: no korean
[4:20:48] fatalqwerty: monte how do the pros fuck up their builds so much? Dont they have separate coaches for that?
[4:20:51] choicegg: yeah in seoul you should make it through
[4:20:54] Syrmen: @fartnugget45 because players usually follow what they see on other regions or soloq, few people actually researches which build is truly optimal i guess
[4:20:58] saltywalty1337: no mercs on jax was also criminal
[4:20:59] commando1814: is 2$ soju worth it ?
[4:21:03] gebby_03: did the 2 caps solo kills already happen?
[4:21:05] lolznaga: google translate can read street signs
[4:21:15] fljqpy: ye the translate tech is OP
[4:21:19] crocodilexxd: Pros don't really research on the builds for their champs but just go through what is recommended to them automatically f
[4:21:19] commando1814: @lolznaga holy fuck !
[4:21:22] torgoat: the future is now
[4:21:26] xraikugen: true
[4:21:27] AzureCatalyst: What if you don't have a Korean SIM cARD
[4:21:34] Quint_5s: @fartnugget45 crazy when u expect them to have deep items knowledge
[4:21:43] AzureCatalyst: How would you recommend getting a Korean Phone number temporarily to get Cell service and internet
[4:21:44] Ichigeki1: @AzureCatalyst then you didnt prepare for your trip properly tbh
[4:21:50] lolznaga: you can rent a cell hotspot at the airpoirt

[4:22:01] commando1814: now here's the real question; is the beer good in Korea ?
[4:22:03] hairykintama: is KT better than SKT?
[4:22:10] fljqpy: depending on whether u chooose skt or kt u gonna get it
[4:22:12] AzureCatalyst: Ye I was looking for those booths in Taiwan and they were further than expected

[4:24:42] shahzaad: LEC production didn't turn out as bad as I expected this week
[4:24:44] fljqpy: go to japan for shochu
[4:24:54] choicegg: idk man a someone whos still in their 20s flavored soju kinda goes hard
[4:24:59] heeman1119: soju hate is unironically so based

[4:25:55] fartnugget45: this lucian is so good in team fights honestly
[4:25:57] skillv1: hahaha varus solo drake while teamfight
[4:26:00] fartnugget45: hes playing out of his mind

[4:27:41] Syrmen: before xin respawns and take it i guess
[4:27:44] Kufner: they must really be underestimating varus elder

[4:34:06] Pergrim: LUL
[4:34:11] IEatLamas: ADHD blinking
[4:34:12] S1lentSymphony: I think OW2 having an actual free floating neutral spectator mode with the ability for spectators to see all health bars, etc. Will make a huge impact in OW gaining actual esports footing.
[4:34:16] kerokerogrips: needs some subway surfer
[4:34:44] liamismyname3: the player order being top closest to the middle  instead of left-right irks me so much
[4:34:44] commando1814: @s1lentsymphony I'm so excited for that !

[4:35:23] g2nejko: Kappa adam approves
[4:35:31] handygamer: How does NRG intend to win teamfights? Hope for FLY to full int into Azir while Kalista is kiting?
[4:35:35] IEatLamas: W damage and E armor pen I think
[4:35:39] fljqpy: LCS players must be forced to pick new champs every game for the entertainment value
[4:36:03] kovacevicd: Nah im a Sion main, so I hate Darius with a meticulous passion
[4:36:27] S1lentSymphony: @commando1814 I may not play OW, but I think having this bit will make it actually watchable. With good casting talent, those games are going to be a blast to watch.
[4:36:41] ElMeanJoe: ghost/ignite

[4:41:07] kovacevicd: "Pause the game I am not getting Minions" ~ Fbi probably

[4:41:40] Kufner: so whats the take on jensen on flyq tom brady levels of team around him or not washed like we thought
[4:41:50] najafan: Those big screens cycling people showing their drip is cringe af, ngl
[4:41:59] IEatLamas: I think seju shouldn't even go bot tbh
[4:42:04] aggresivelypassive: fuck riot
[4:42:22] IEatLamas: @najafan are those the players or what
[4:42:23] najafan: Blue was so aggressive that Sej felt she needed to
[4:42:27] najafan: @IEatLamas Yeah

[4:43:26] najafan: And FBI got FB
[4:43:31] IEatLamas: Look at seju too how much she lost from going bot

[4:43:41] fljqpy: FBI = First Blood Instigator
[4:43:46] saltywalty1337: but I'm here for spicy monte comments on games
[4:43:54] IEatLamas: F-u-n-d-a-m-e-n-t-a-l-s
[4:44:05] skillv1: lets share some exp party under tower
[4:44:08] fljqpy: 3v3 botlane LUL
[4:44:09] kovacevicd: Dom about had a stroke watching this game, feel bad for Inspired
[4:44:15] Finfen: This entire game is a showcase of how to beat FLY. Top side strength doesn’t matter if your jungler has to sac his entire game to just make your bot lane be behind by only 75 CS. Sejuani kinda needs to shove it down K‘Santes throat with Darius, but Inspired has to babysit this bot lane.
[4:44:37] gebby_03: because he felt what Inspired did this game
[4:44:40] Nightlapse: Dom felt for Inspired who constantly has to hold lanes
[4:44:40] War_Wren: He imagined he was inspired and got triggered
[4:44:44] kerokerogrips: dom had a stroke cuz he could only imagine what life was like for inspired in this game
[4:44:46] kovacevicd: Yeah basically cause Inspired didn't even get to play league of legends
[4:44:47] g2nejko: he said inspires should sell his items and run it down
[4:44:49] g2nejko: inspired*
[4:44:51] gebby_03: he said that Inspired should be allowed to run it down
[4:44:57] Doorpost877: he said that inspired should be allowed to just sprint it down lol
[4:45:00] NaughtyShrink: to be fair, he had been streaming for like 20 hours straight
[4:45:02] Canadianboy3: was interesting listening to co stream, DL preaching inspired needs to stay bot, but Meteos is saying opposite like its lost, now hes behind
[4:45:04] fatalqwerty: Inspired probably feels like "guys let's just ff" BigBrother
[4:45:08] effeecct: the jungle and adc gap in this game is a canyon
[4:45:16] Doorpost877: literally said he should sell everything for swifties and sprint it down mid
[4:45:44] IEatLamas: seju didn't even have to go bot or am I wrong
[4:45:49] najafan: Rend is a pretty strong ability guys
[4:45:53] skillv1: palafox fakering
[4:45:54] fljqpy: doublelift busio would have won that Kappa
[4:45:59] skillv1: slower tho
[4:46:24] aggresivelypassive: That was gross
[4:46:25] Kufner: so jensen still is pretty washed
[4:46:29] gebby_03: Inspired even tried to hover that
[4:46:32] leamfor: thought he was safe, cause he thought rell left
[4:46:40] Rgb14: omega feels bad
[4:46:43] aggresivelypassive: Is Jensen just collecting a paycheck nowadays?
[4:46:49] g2nejko: bwipo watching this after burning his ghost and wasting time to get enemy jungler behind LUL
[4:47:01] g2nejko: only for his team to run it
[4:47:18] leamfor: His jg is right there, why would Palafox engage?
[4:47:35] kovacevicd: Inspired actually spent more time covering waves than killing jungle camps

[4:48:36] skillv1: 26 cs
[4:48:45] fatalqwerty: these western divers need to learn from Chinese dives
[4:49:16] heeman1119: azir dying is criminal
[4:49:32] gebby_03: this looked like the Targamans milio dive
[4:49:34] fatalqwerty: and this lads, is why Monte would never be a coach for a western team ever again Kappa
[4:49:40] InitialiseCasts: that was a pretty criminal dive
[4:49:42] mifot: jungle cs looking mighty fun
[4:49:54] heeman1119: clownfiestas only Sadge
[4:49:57] aggresivelypassive: 14 years and still fucking up the basics
[4:49:58] kerokerogrips: the funniest part is that Caedrel said the NA games were entertaining when he was co streaming them
[4:50:04] kovacevicd: Daisy literally 1v1ing the enemy ADC
[4:50:09] IEatLamas: 18 cs sejuani. Literally threw the game by running bot like some silver
[4:50:19] Pergrim: we could call it bangers and mash , some are bangers some are just mash
[4:50:19] Play_Time7: i actually wonder what happened toplane or is this matchup just good for ksante
[4:50:28] fatalqwerty: Huhi's screen is just constnatly gray I kinda feel bad form him LuL
[4:50:46] gebby_03: think inspired is happy that his top is loosing with counter pick and his mid and bot are running it down
[4:50:49] Sjkaev: what the hell is this region bozo play cmon maaann
[4:50:51] jpegexe: kalista wasted mana and couldnt r rell
[4:50:58] kovacevicd: @play_time7 Bwipo just played it badly, he tried all inning ksante with plated steel caps
[4:51:00] epicalbawler: to be fair renata q really fucked huhi over
[4:51:04] epicalbawler: it wasnt as bad as the first dive
[4:51:12] Play_Time7: @kovacevicd ah ok
[4:51:46] livid_poptart: how relieved do you think Yamato must feel knowing his team isn't going 0-9 in the LEC
[4:51:50] gebby_03: him and fbi where laughing the whole game
[4:52:05] kovacevicd: Also lethal tempo would be better cause just like Garen in to Ksante, the entire idea is to use ult to execute him when Ksante ults
[4:52:13] fljqpy: LCS is so entertaining
[4:52:25] gebby_03: you should checks dom's video on this game, he started screaming at a point
[4:52:52] gebby_03: tell him that inspired was gapped

[4:52:54] g2nejko: jensen :tf:
[4:52:56] thisisKakashi: what about it is tilt inducing
[4:52:59] Sjkaev: ok i came with wrong mindset, i repent: entertain us na lcs!
[4:53:02] Thomas_Bont: jensen trading his life for that cannon minion
[4:53:23] blargh4: "I got the cannon worth" - jensen
[4:53:25] Rgb14: jensen is so tilted omg
[4:53:29] epicalbawler: jensen lets huhi walk into melee range
[4:53:32] najafan: Inspired is 25 cs down at 9 minutes, that's clearly a jg gap. Kappa
[4:53:32] epicalbawler: fluke midlander
[4:53:34] ThatLatvianGuy: is the 4 horsemen still happening tonight?
[4:53:47] Kufner: died for cannon unreal
[4:53:59] profound23: he can just walk away and hit the cannon with a rocket
[4:54:02] nipplePICLE: cant wait for 4 horseman!
[4:54:11] blaargh124: he thought about the game from inspireds point and couldnt handle it at some point which is fair
[4:54:13] fatalqwerty: I wanna hear FLY comms, probably a lot of Inspired just sighing LUL
[4:54:13] fupoohs: fupoohs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[4:54:16] aoersie: Inspired is probably crying at that point
[4:54:37] kovacevicd: I mean Inspired actually getting griefed
[4:54:52] gebby_03: Forest said he saw Jensen on Corki and put 3500$ on NRG
[4:55:05] Sjkaev: nrg coulda just been npc's and still won LUL
[4:55:17] kerokerogrips: @gebby_03 BASED
[4:55:34] kerokerogrips: monte 7tv twitch  extension when
[4:55:37] thisisKakashi: i feel like corki isnt even hard though
[4:55:38] kovacevicd: The funny part of this is how many times NRG throws and gives Fly a chance back in this game
[4:55:40] thisisKakashi: how can you be bad at corki
[4:56:02] Sjkaev: jensen....
[4:56:05] fartnugget45: jensen had a real banger of a game
[4:56:05] whyisthatlamptalking: NotLikeThis
[4:56:05] skillv1: tpping here is a waste of time, better getting plates
[4:56:07] g2nejko: :tf:
[4:56:08] fatalqwerty: LUL JENSEN CORKI
[4:56:10] najafan: @thisisKakashi You literally just stay 30' back from everything and ult constantly.
[4:56:13] najafan: It's so easy
[4:56:24] backwoodsmf: What is happening right now? NotLikeThis
[4:56:27] kAtz124: TP AT THE LAST SECOND? HUH
[4:56:29] fartnugget45: he didnt have enough gold for his item so he needed to tp bot for a quick kill :)
[4:56:29] skillv1: because he pushed the wave first
[4:56:36] kovacevicd: He wanted those 3 castor minions
[4:56:45] fatalqwerty: Jensen's mind works beyond human understanding Monte, you should stop trying to make sense out of his actions
[4:57:03] fljqpy: sure is a banger
[4:57:04] Finfen: Mindset. Jensen usually plays mages that actually can trade early. On Corki you need to be willing to AFK for 7 minutes.
[4:57:08] Sjkaev: this is gonna be a banger power spike later LUL
[4:57:11] najafan: Corki's an idiot proof champ.
[4:57:14] mifot: was he just afk in the midlane?
[4:57:20] mifot: the minions are at the turret
[4:57:27] najafan: Now, to be a really good Corki, yeah, you have to be a bit riskier.
[4:57:38] najafan: But fundamentally you can't mess up Corki.
[4:57:46] fljqpy: this aint the LCK we go for kills only
[4:57:50] fartnugget45: the only "risky" thing about corki is a package in, but even then you can w out of it
[4:57:51] kAtz124: he didn't have tp when azir walk out from grump? looks like he ahd
[4:58:05] najafan: @fartnugget45 Eh, maximizing E damage is a bit risky.
[4:58:05] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[4:58:12] fatalqwerty: @fljqpy we already have LPL for that tho, and they do dives more elegantly than these guys
[4:58:21] Sjkaev: who thought top lane is the most sane in this match
[4:58:31] blaargh124: that tp is pure copium isnt it
[4:58:51] Noed22: nice insec
[4:59:01] Kaniskion: palafaker PogUU
[4:59:07] IEatLamas: idk it is really like silver plays. If we had an engine like in chess that could determine the rank of individual plays... oh man
[4:59:13] fljqpy: @fatalqwerty yea but what if i want to see fails LUL
[4:59:28] mifot: you can attack your own pink???
[4:59:42] blargh4: why didnt renata handshake while fbi was stunned
[4:59:54] nipplePICLE: toplane impact Aware
[4:59:56] Finfen: Sometimes you just have to life with your weaknesses and turn them into strengths. -FBI while inting mid again
[4:59:58] epicalbawler: azir is overpowered and im not afraid to say it
[5:00:00] Zanien: GAME OVER GO G2
[5:00:02] g2nejko: Bwipo watching this Kappa
[5:00:02] kAtz124: I dont think Jesen's present make any diff there xdd
[5:00:08] fartnugget45: TIL if you see renata ulting you just pink  your feet
[5:00:17] fatalqwerty: wait LCS features twitch chat now? LUL
[5:00:19] effeecct: @Zanien g2 was already watched before this
[5:00:25] Zanien: oh ok
[5:00:40] leamfor: Prios champions
[5:00:43] Madghyr: chanpions habe prio over eards
[5:00:43] kovacevicd: You will prio champs
[5:00:50] gardnalor: i think renata has prio targets
[5:00:58] Mykaels: the only way to hit your ward is if it's the only thing in auto range
[5:01:02] gebby_03: champs,monsters and wards
[5:01:06] Pioneer_OW: @Madghyr thought this was a diff language for a sec lol
[5:01:08] kovacevicd: Prios targeting friendly Champs, them enemy Champs, then anything else
[5:01:15] Madghyr: but if you have to move to find a champ then it would work
[5:01:17] Mykaels: the only lower priority is running if theres nothing in range
[5:01:18] najafan: Also why is Jensen building Corki wrong.
[5:01:20] najafan: jfc
[5:01:26] najafan: This man
[5:01:35] kAtz124: surely corki can save the fight if he had TP LuL
[5:01:42] leamfor: @najafan It's the right build, what you talking about
[5:02:02] najafan: @leamfor Malignance?
[5:02:03] skillv1: huhi "calculated"
[5:02:12] leamfor: @najafan That's 3rd item, bro.
[5:02:16] fatalqwerty: WOW Huhi is just having a very lucky game rn wtf
[5:02:18] Play_Time7: this is just an unfortunate game isnt it
[5:02:27] qidydl: just win everywhere at once 4Head
[5:02:41] epicalbawler: if nrg could take out the derp in their gameplay they'd be really good
[5:02:49] najafan: @leamfor I've definitely seen a lot of builds skip Muramana entirely.
[5:02:53] kovacevicd: Not sure why Bwipo doesn't have shoes yet on a champion that relies on movement speed
[5:02:59] leamfor: @najafan Name 3
[5:03:33] kovacevicd: He could've just ran away

[5:03:37] kovacevicd: But he ran back in
[5:03:53] fatalqwerty: Huhi is just having a fantastic time LUL
[5:04:18] LightfellowFGC: Flowers is so good
[5:04:22] thisisKakashi: ik fly threw this game from level 1 but you think nrg is decent?
[5:04:28] xChip102: funny how 3 of flyquests kills are from turret dives
[5:04:59] Noed22: was darius a counterpick or?
[5:05:01] fartnugget45: full on clown fiesta
[5:05:06] najafan: @leamfor Huh, guess you're right. Must have missed it, just checked the stats. Fair enough.
[5:05:21] kAtz124: that shows their macro is bad right
[5:05:21] MrFlubberMuffin: self counter pick it seems LOL
[5:05:25] jomvom: what actually beats ksante
[5:05:30] LightfellowFGC: Darius wins the lane, but lmao
[5:05:33] kovacevicd: @noed22 Bwipo griefed the lane
[5:05:33] brapvig: Does Azir Soldiers proc Fleet Footwork?
[5:05:39] MrFlubberMuffin: Yes
[5:05:54] fartnugget45: i mean its not like darius was getting solo killed by ksante. the lane looked fairly even. darius died to lane swaps
[5:05:59] LightfellowFGC: God the LCS overlay is so bad
[5:06:20] blaargh124: something bad must have happened like lv 4-6 toplane
[5:06:24] Thomas_Bont: i dont think he griefed lane, they obviously wanted inspired to come top but hes stuck in bot jail
[5:06:33] commando1814: do you like the lich bane poke azir ?
[5:06:34] kovacevicd: @fartnugget45 He tried to all in at a bad time (his phage to ksante plated steel caps) and got forced out of lane
[5:06:36] qidydl: that z-fighting is terrible
[5:06:38] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo isnt right comp really bad like maybe if sej goes warmogs and procs it enough times in fight for corki and varus to poke
[5:07:12] kerokerogrips: @jomvom 369 showed what udyr can do to a ksante
[5:07:26] Sjkaev: surely nrg wins this one right
[5:07:32] fartnugget45: @kovacevicd cs was even and turret dmg was also even. wasnt even that bad of a play. the lane was just straight up even. their comp wanted sejuani to snowball top too but sej was stuck bot lane
[5:07:34] jomvom: has NA picked the gnar into it yet?
[5:07:38] fatalqwerty: is LCS still Bo1? Is this the last game for today?
[5:07:47] blaargh124: I have to say this is one of the most entertaining corki azir games ever
[5:08:17] gebby_03: forest would have been on the streets if nrg lost this
[5:08:21] Kufner: malig 3rd?
[5:08:30] kovacevicd: @fartnugget45 Yeah but he coulda left after Azir Ivern instead he went back in and died, got ganked after and died, so it snowballed outta control even more
[5:08:39] kovacevicd: Whole game was a shit show really
[5:08:40] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[5:08:54] Kufner: i know corki does magic output instead of his ad but its dbl ad
[5:08:59] fatalqwerty: Maybe Jensen just felt like he was getting bodied too much this game and had to get the shield
[5:09:32] kovacevicd: This is where dom lost his mind cause inspired got cced for like 10 seconds LUL
[5:09:39] mifot: a little late on the package
[5:09:41] fatalqwerty: inspired's gonna need a long smoke break after this one lads... FeelsStrongMan
[5:10:01] jomvom: corki ap scalings are so bad tho
[5:10:10] Kufner: did he not have a null magic mantle as well earlier? where did that go?
[5:10:15] AzureCatalyst: Malignance just makes the poke so much more effective which makes the resetting more likely
[5:10:20] skillv1: bwipo bad positioning
[5:10:22] thisisKakashi: your damage is ap anyways
[5:10:22] jomvom: like why not go voidstaff?
[5:10:24] AzureCatalyst: Going eclipse second doesn't strengthen your comp's win cons
[5:10:46] Thomas_Bont: lets be honest here though, swapping eclipse and malignance in his build order wouldnt have saved this game haha
[5:11:07] AzureCatalyst: NGL I think Huhi was an upgrade over Ignar
[5:11:24] AzureCatalyst: Huhi has been just a fucking demon when he's in metas like these
[5:11:25] zentek12: does eclipse even help in boosting damage?
[5:11:27] ThatLatvianGuy: Papa's birthday gift FeelsBadMan
[5:11:43] jomvom: yeah eclipse is good item @zentek12
[5:11:59] thisisKakashi: to be fair fly draft is pretty atrocious toop
[5:12:14] Sjkaev: that rell ult Kreygasm
[5:12:17] fatalqwerty: someoen show us huhi just laughing
[5:12:17] Thomas_Bont: @zentek12 malignance manamune/eclipse procs all 3 things on a rocket
[5:12:50] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo wouldnt inspired's infamous fiddle be mega op this game against blue comp
[5:12:52] AndersKool: FBI Huhi gives me hope for NA
[5:12:56] thisisKakashi: huhi got player of week
[5:13:00] AzureCatalyst: huhi laughs spark ioy
[5:13:00] ThatLatvianGuy: did papa take them on a 3 day bender or what?
[5:13:05] fatalqwerty: VoHiYo see you guys
[5:13:10] Sjkaev: new way to watch nalcs: put on huhi's facecam
[5:13:20] Noed22: huhi just gets better and better
[5:13:58] kovacevicd: If what they did happened in soloq the jungler is typing "gl yall on your own" and never returning bot LUL
