[0:56:15] MajinBuubs: https://7tv.app/emotes/65a0bc6656334fd9fd11d88f it's this one he's my favourite capy of all time
[0:56:15] MissJenella: that vayne mid game was the one game I missed watching
[0:56:22] OmegaMonsoon: why not fleet footwork?
[0:56:24] MissJenella: too bad, I wish I could've seen c9 lose
[0:56:25] pikaish: i forgot glacial was a thing LMAO
[0:56:33] denunciator: what's important to me is that you're confident on the pick and you don't ego, we'll find a way to make it work. just like a relationship stuntRakan
[0:56:33] MajinBuubs: i saw it in quantum's chat
[0:56:33] Apostolique: Probably Corky was a better pick
[0:56:33] lolddoss: gotcha
[0:56:37] pIasmate: why pta over energize btw?
[0:56:43] just_vibin_wit_you: So, stunt.. I have been building predictive models of fappy's games. And, it is really interesting... The biggest predictor of the outcome of his games (and probably yours too) is the mastery points value of the last champ pick summoner on each side (red or blue).
[0:56:48] pIasmate: fleet gives you ms and some hp
[0:56:50] ThomasTheTwink: would electrocute work with the e passive to do in just 2 autos?
[0:56:51] ChromaKhroma: @MajinBuubs quantSquish
[0:56:53] just_vibin_wit_you: using random forrest
[0:56:53] Apostolique: *Corki
[0:57:02] MajinBuubs: CAPYBARA
[0:57:03] skever24: try aery
[0:57:04] TrollAnnie_: that capybara was famous it was on the news: https://twitter.com/capybara_love_/status/1745725640513622294
[0:57:05] MajinBuubs: thank you
[0:57:06] MissJenella: aww
[0:57:07] shinyclodsire: CAPYBARA
[0:57:10] TrollAnnie_: CAPYBARA
[0:57:11] MissJenella: CAPYBARA it is very cute
[0:57:12] shinyclodsire: look at em go
[0:57:17] cloudydaisies: CAPYBARA
[0:57:37] TrollAnnie_: CAPYBARA x Thriller
[0:57:52] just_vibin_wit_you: 50,000 games that fappy was in or someone that played with fappy was in
[0:57:55] Plahbie: CAPYBARA
[0:58:01] Apostolique: @just_vibin_wit_you Last champ pick as in the 5th pick on each team?
[0:58:03] 5turdy: hi stunt
[0:58:09] just_vibin_wit_you: @Apostolique exactly
[0:58:15] Apostolique: Interesting
[0:58:22] Apostolique: Does that generalize to all players?
[0:58:27] just_vibin_wit_you: so, if last pick gets their one trick that team wins
[0:58:30] pIasmate: isn't the scaling hp rune better than 8 ap?
[0:58:41] ChromaKhroma: hmm
[0:58:45] just_vibin_wit_you: 50,000 games that fappy was in or someone that played with fappy was in <--- it expands when you include the other 9 people
[0:58:49] Apostolique: 50k? rookie numbers
[0:58:50] MissJenella: wtf
[0:58:53] ChromaKhroma: i have like 7k arams or something
[0:59:00] MajinBuubs: CAPYBARA walking to lane as support tf CAPYBARA
[0:59:03] just_vibin_wit_you: all summoners fappy has played with
[0:59:17] TrollAnnie_: CAPYBARA walking to the quason store so he can GIGACAPY and give his friend a CapyRose
[0:59:19] Apostolique: I'll try to notice that from now on
[0:59:19] MissJenella: I have 6k arams and maybe like 4.2k SR games
[0:59:19] xyie23: That is the best tf skin imo
[0:59:24] just_vibin_wit_you: i think it came out to like 900 summoners
[0:59:35] DesuLaDesu: that's 13 games a day for ten years, tbh kinda feasable
[0:59:35] ChromaKhroma: i feel like its possible to have had 50k games
[0:59:36] Apostolique: How much mastery btw?
[0:59:39] ChromaKhroma: but rly no life for 10 years
[0:59:52] just_vibin_wit_you: @Apostolique i dont know
[0:59:59] MissJenella: oh I mistyped my SR games I have like 3.2k I think
[1:00:04] MissJenella: @ChromaKhroma yup agree LOL
[1:00:15] OmegaMonsoon: how do yall know how many games you i have im curious on how many i have lol
[1:00:28] just_vibin_wit_you: like, the mastery of last pick was more important than if fappy was on teemo or on roll
[1:00:31] MissJenella: @OmegaMonsoon you can see in post game at the top under victory/defeat
[1:00:31] just_vibin_wit_you: role*
[1:00:35] just_vibin_wit_you: that is crazy to me
[1:00:47] MissJenella: I just remember my approx amount off the top of my head
[1:00:53] OmegaMonsoon: @MissJenella thats just for that season now?
[1:01:06] MissJenella: @OmegaMonsoon for arams and norms it doesn't reset
[1:01:11] OmegaMonsoon: ahhh
[1:01:22] MissJenella: only ranked resets but you can always go opgg and count HAHA
[1:01:26] ChromaKhroma: @just_vibin_wit_you well, its just the average of all the data they took - i dont know if most people who play league are onetricks
[1:01:58] TrollAnnie_: me when im walkin CAPYBARA
[1:02:01] Apostolique: @just_vibin_wit_you Is it based on mastery diff between the last pick on both teams?
[1:02:04] MissJenella: hwei EE and sett E are just "now kiss"
[1:02:07] just_vibin_wit_you: @ChromaKhroma well, i used decision tree, random forrest, and a neural net and they all found the same relationship across a large game sample
[1:02:08] sparkweee: stunt will you play gangplank support?
[1:02:20] just_vibin_wit_you: @Apostolique no, the absolute value
[1:02:22] gumibon: 7 minions is so easy to get, i hate that
[1:02:24] pIasmate: 21 baron takedowns is 1.5% of the LoL playerbase..
[1:02:25] retreedee: you get cut for executing minuons now?
[1:02:50] Apostolique: So if one player has 1 million mastery and other player has 100k, it's more likely the 1 million's team will win?
[1:03:10] just_vibin_wit_you: @Apostolique yes
[1:03:22] ChromaKhroma: @just_vibin_wit_you ooh wow stuntNoted maybe its like champ comfortability (related to mastery) is most important but can get overruled sometimes by counterpick so mastery of last pick more important than others
[1:03:24] ChromaKhroma: tink
[1:03:24] gumibon: @Apostolique Not always, it's kind of like if you have 1million mastery points and in the same elo as a 100k, you have plateau'd
[1:03:44] Apostolique: @gumibon That's not what we're talking about lol
[1:03:49] pIasmate: I've seen someone with 6.2m mastery and they still lost :P
[1:03:50] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[1:03:52] just_vibin_wit_you: @gumibon this was only for fappy's games so masters+
[1:04:04] gumibon: oh sorry i just got back
[1:04:14] MissJenella: mastery don't mean shit, it just means you play a lot xd
[1:04:16] gumibon: i thought u just meant mastery in general
[1:04:23] pIasmate: and 6.2m mastery is insane
[1:04:27] just_vibin_wit_you: it just shows that being last pick matters and picking your comfort champ matters
[1:04:47] MissJenella: I don't even have 3m points across all champs
[1:04:48] gumibon: honestly mastery and level is kind of embarassing at a certain point Dx
[1:04:49] MissJenella: lol
[1:04:57] pIasmate: last pick to counter pick, if on a comfy champ sure
[1:05:04] MissJenella: @gumibon right..
[1:05:12] ChromaKhroma: @gumibon im uninstalling league at level 999 you will not see me with 4 digits
[1:05:18] MissJenella: LOLLL
[1:05:20] gumibon: sometimes i see level 700 players and they have never ranked in their life

[3:34:56] aGoofBall: doesnt shurelyas feel kinf of bad with passive removed?
[3:35:25] ThomasTheTwink: hwei wouldnt really use the passive anyway hes getting mostly for the stats

[3:37:38] LoLEnryu: ngl nilah works surprisingly well with a lot of unconventional supports bc of her kit
[3:38:01] Shaliban: damn that ps game add was loud. i hate loud adds

[3:41:06] CheefCake: Hey there @stunt  and hello chat
[3:41:19] LoLEnryu: bonus 15% shielding from passive, but mainly i think hwei makes up for nilah's lack of range and nilah can engage and follow up on hwei cc
[3:41:21] ThomasTheTwink: hwei support sera apc is the play
[3:41:22] ThomasTheTwink: frfr

[3:43:07] LoLEnryu: ah u've never experienced the nilah side, whenever the passive procs it lags my screen

[3:48:46] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[3:49:22] Damiusx: is hwei actually legit for sup after all the buffs now?
[3:49:56] Buhzzi: if i didnt dodge you would have played against me lol
[3:49:58] Buhzzi: unlucky
[3:50:49] BeachBoi: Like lux can?
[3:50:50] everyman322: does hwei have 16 spells?
[3:50:59] sumthingsup: 10
[3:51:06] sumthingsup: three per basic then ult
[3:51:10] Zirock_: He has 10
[3:51:16] Hokego: 11 with passive
[3:51:26] everyman322: oh ok I get it now thanks chat
[3:51:26] Joop34: Any tips for first timing Hwei?
[3:51:41] Damiusx: Is he mechanically hard, or is it simple enough outside of actually remembering all the spells? Like, are they hard to use, or is the hard part knowing and using them all apropriatly?
[3:53:11] denm101: he has a lot of mechanically difficult setups and can be hard
[3:53:13] Hokego: As a Hwei player, I think he's very simple. Once you have muscle memory over his spells. But then again, I thought Aphelios was impossible. Depends on the person I guess
[3:53:43] Zirock_: Not mechanically hard imo. You can only cast 3 spells at a time
[3:53:55] Zirock_: Not that hard at least
[3:53:59] sumthingsup: i saw one rell clip that literally killed all those grubs at the same time, saving time by not dealing with the shields
[3:54:00] ThomasTheTwink: he didn’t feel mechanically demanding to me it’s like brand combo mage but karma ult decision making
[3:54:30] Hokego: @sumthingsup sounds like one of those chinese insta reels
[3:54:36] vegandiamond: what does stan for clear skin mean
[3:54:44] ThomasTheTwink: skincare secret POGGIES
[3:54:56] sumthingsup: no it was an english-speaking streamer seeing it done by his jungler
[3:55:22] ThomasTheTwink: Stan skibbles changed my life my skin is clear my crops are watered my dad came home
[3:56:27] critterxchris: does WE effect ult or just basic abilities/autos?
[3:56:40] BKhamzi: Good night everyone!! Hope your week goes well <3 stuntLove2 bkhamzHeart
[3:56:51] ThomasTheTwink: gn
[3:56:52] TwitchTime89: gn BKhamzi
[3:57:03] everyman322: he has aether wisp too though
[3:58:07] sumthingsup: why lucidity?
[3:58:20] Hokego: cooldown
[3:58:29] sumthingsup: no i get that
[3:58:39] sumthingsup: what i mean is why is cd more important than pen
[3:58:52] Juliaggpolka: to spam abilites i think?
[3:59:01] Juliaggpolka: more damage over time
[3:59:30] xtyphonz: huh
[3:59:45] Shaliban: and as always. when support have any CC its really nice to have it off cd. instead of making a bit more damage
[3:59:52] Endz_Nz: but what if u miss every spell
[3:59:57] Xelyz: I mean theres only 4 cds
[3:59:59] digicake_: this is lightning McQueens song
[4:00:11] konenio: 10 or 11?
[4:00:13] sumthingsup: huh, never saw it that way. i mean it's pretty straight forward, AH means more spells, but hwei literally has a passive that rewards more spellcasts than more damage.
[4:00:22] sumthingsup: thank you!
[4:00:25] Hokego: CD helps with his survivability too. More CC, more disengage, more harass
[4:00:29] FrothingKook: @endz_nz then you lose anyways
[4:00:55] sickologyson: surprised your winning. ez looked like a sure fire win trader in pob's last game
[4:01:08] sumthingsup: no the thing is that is true for most mage supports but you still go pen on them. the question is more directed specifically to hwei
[4:01:11] MajinBuubs: i don't think that's how that math works but the cdr is more useful for support hwei cause you're not scaling as much ap as carry
[4:01:22] sumthingsup: which stunt just answered. 11 spells and a passive that rewards frequent spellcasts.
[4:01:34] noahnamexd: hi stunt
[4:01:46] sumthingsup: 10 spells + passive i mean
[4:01:57] ThomasTheTwink: oh god
[4:02:32] ThomasTheTwink: oh holy shit
[4:02:36] ThomasTheTwink: ur so right
[4:03:08] everyman322: well he aint called balls r dragon

[4:59:54] iamyourleader: the tick rate changes make comet soooooo goood
[5:00:03] iamyourleader: you get more ticks
[5:00:04] iamyourleader: yeah
[5:00:07] iamyourleader: instead of it falling off
[5:00:13] iamyourleader: before you only ever got 3 ticks / passive application
[5:00:17] doom477: the tickrate from his passiv is from 1.05sec to 0.25 sec
[5:00:19] iamyourleader: now you get 12-14 ticks per passive application
[5:00:19] bergsdal: Bard has a really high skillcap, its laughable the diifference between a good bard vs bad
[5:00:21] neckrow: make sure to get your free 5* on honkai
[5:00:31] iamyourleader: so you can get slightly more than 2% burn per passive  technically
[5:00:36] neckrow: who?
[5:00:37] iamyourleader: because it rolls 14 times if you dont cast another spell
[5:00:48] neckrow: i want that 5 star imaginary healer
[5:00:49] pIasmate: as support brand, is it rylai first, or liandry?
[5:00:52] iamyourleader: nah its not that bad
[5:00:55] NJzFinest: karma destroys brand
[5:00:55] iamyourleader: I go liandry
[5:00:59] zzz_iton: oh no
[5:00:59] iamyourleader: most people go rylai
[5:01:11] bergsdal: its the players crashing the lobby?
[5:01:20] iamyourleader: my build is for maximum damage so I go sorcs -> liandry -> rylai -> riftmaker/void/deadmans as I need
[5:01:28] zzz_iton: really ?
[5:01:30] zzz_iton: omo
[5:01:32] bergsdal: XD wow
[5:01:34] bergsdal: How?
[5:01:40] iamyourleader: yeah
[5:01:42] DudeBroMaximus: So they get no dodge timer?
[5:01:43] iamyourleader: it been around for a bit
[5:01:45] bergsdal: Like they ddos a specific server on riots end?
[5:01:46] iamyourleader: riot api fucked
[5:01:50] iamyourleader: no
[5:01:57] iamyourleader: the way the previous lobby crasher worked
[5:02:00] OmegaMonsoon: i wonder if they lose lp still?
[5:02:02] iamyourleader: which is probably somewhat related to the current one
[5:02:06] vegandiamond: 😭  󠀀
[5:02:11] iamyourleader: is that they are in a custom/training game
[5:02:25] vegandiamond: streaming is a more stable career than junior software engineer rn
[5:02:26] iamyourleader: that is created/joined and started right before the ranked lobby starts
[5:02:34] iamyourleader: so the ranked lobby tries to go through
[5:02:37] iamyourleader: and it cant because they're in a game
[5:02:39] bergsdal: ooohh
[5:02:41] iamyourleader: so it just crashes
[5:02:46] mightylamb123: Good moooooorning!
[5:02:49] iamyourleader: thast how the last lobby crasher worked
[5:02:55] ZloyIndy: @mightylamb123 VoHiYo
[5:03:08] bergsdal: that makes sense, so the coustom lobby has higher priority bcs it started before the ranked lobby? XD
[5:03:08] mightylamb123: @ZloyIndy VoHiYo
[5:03:15] iamyourleader: its not higher priority
[5:03:20] iamyourleader: the system just cant have 1 personi n 2 games at once
[5:03:23] iamyourleader: so any new games are broken
[5:03:26] bergsdal: NAHHH
[5:03:27] zzz_iton: why is he showing up as # ?
[5:03:32] bergsdal: LOOLL

[6:24:10] Ghostloon: Scared
[6:24:11] ghostringtft: atp just remove bans in challenger mmr so every game isnt decided in champ select
[6:24:29] yellowazns123: lfpwh#na1
[6:24:30] TwitchTime89: stunt is the sweetest!!!!
[6:24:31] vogue_hommes: ghostringtft it'll probably make the meta super stale
[6:24:32] dababy69123: @ghostringtft then they have cancer meta abusers every game lol
[6:24:37] bergsdal: kinda crazy you legit cannot play any other champ besides 1
[6:24:47] b3llamy: how about they give OTPs dodge protection
[6:24:47] epsilondelta327: @dababy69123 thats why I have 5 accounts: spread out my mediocre gameplay kek
[6:24:51] Ghostloon: stuntDetective
[6:25:02] bergsdal: like, in your elo i would imagine atleast people would have mastered 2 just incase they get target bannned
[6:25:02] ghostringtft: i dont think playing meta is "abuse" lol
[6:25:07] vogue_hommes: MusicMakeYouLoseControl
[6:25:10] dababy69123: @epsilondelta327 just queue into urself and wintrade with urself
[6:25:11] Hokego: I bet 4k and only won back 3k...
[6:25:12] dababy69123: xdd
[6:25:20] Deku_Dreaming: OTPs should at least have a pocket pick or two imo
[6:25:28] InfernalPotatoes: Why do you play on several accounts instead of just one
[6:25:37] epsilondelta327: @dababy69123 id have to be good enough for the chance of that to be real :(
[6:25:42] zerpentinefire: @bergsdal Atleast, yeah!
[6:26:22] dababy69123: @epsilondelta327 I mean I had an account that was 70% wr into emerald1 and it was getting +15-30
[6:26:52] dababy69123: so its just weird system maybe not anything we can do
[6:27:05] pnls_lol: porofessor always recommends double scaling hp heh
[6:27:09] b3llamy: melee sups suck in 2024

[6:28:09] dababy69123: i feel like playing for scaling is just a lowelo strat, idk
[6:28:09] yellowazns123: Thanks so much! I do the recommended runes from lol client
[6:28:37] epsilondelta327: @archimedes_9 when I tried those apps I laughed when it labelled me like "UNSTABLE"
[6:28:46] bergsdal: Ye, the recommended are general at best
[6:28:59] oceanchickens: between flat hp and the scaling hp, how can i like uh determine between the two which i should go?
[6:29:14] Hokego: My runes arent gonna stop my top laner from going 0/15 so i'll keep doing the lol client recommended
[6:29:14] dababy69123: what website u see the labels on?
[6:29:22] bergsdal: Ye, like if you play a squishy char against aggresive support, you can always run deff runes, I do and can tank a lot
[6:29:28] DudeBroMaximus: that app used to blow my cover as "loves to invad"
[6:29:42] Ghostloon: One of the recommendations is the most used rune set
[6:29:49] DudeBroMaximus: invade*

[8:13:22] Raktagino: ok so yeah, shaco s+ tier
[8:13:32] ash_chiming: this game is so intense
[8:13:33] shadowkek__: why is kindred weak D:
[8:13:41] CosmoMoss: chem tech is the worst one yeah?
[8:13:49] ash_chiming: I think so
[8:13:59] shadowkek__: it does feel weak
[8:14:00] Senyuno: It's snowbally
[8:14:05] shadowkek__: hey at least it's not old chemtech
[8:14:24] shadowkek__: Clonge

[8:14:54] Thommenius: nt
[8:14:59] shadowkek__: @voidmoons okras for you
[8:15:04] voidmoons: lets gooo
[8:15:07] ash_chiming: nt
[8:15:12] CosmoMoss: rip...
[8:15:16] ash_chiming: can we have ekko next game lol
[8:15:20] TwitchTime89: gg
[8:15:24] shinyclodsire: -50k SAJ
[8:15:25] TwitchTime89: nt
[8:15:27] Thommenius: Dont really understand people who think 15min ff is good, 90% of the time you can still win
[8:15:31] shadowkek__: @shinyclodsire  WHAT
[8:15:32] shadowkek__: HOW
[8:15:53] shadowkek__: @Thommenius you're playing league of legends tho
[8:16:16] shadowkek__: at least in other games there's either a hard or soft reset function baked into the game
[8:16:23] denunciator: i think in vast majority of elos we aren't good enough at closing out nor at assessing if a game is truly over
[8:16:30] shadowkek__: but because of snowball... its not likely
[8:16:41] Thommenius: Yeah, but you still have the chance, ff is always a loss, and you gain what, 10 to 15 min times?
[8:16:41] voidmoons: omg
[8:16:43] CosmoMoss: 53 k OMG
[8:16:48] voidmoons: i now have 750k okras
[8:16:54] voidmoons: EZ
[8:17:03] Zirock_: Hate this 15 min mentality too. It's like people can only handle playing league if they're winning
[8:17:11] Deku_Dreaming: honestly I hate ff15 in ranked
[8:17:19] denunciator: i think a lot of times ff-denied games are lost not because they were actually lost, but because the mentals are already broken
[8:17:35] ash_chiming: @voidmoons can you please request ekko lol I don’t have enough
[8:17:36] vogue_hommes: they got rid of ff@10 with 3 votes in quickplay
[8:17:42] voidmoons: oop
[8:17:47] voidmoons: CHAIR STREAM duckass
[8:17:51] bibambina: just lost a game where mid, jgl and bot were doing perfect BUT top lane fed gp so he solo won after all. games like these just frustrate me so much its insane
[8:17:55] Senyuno: Yeah I hate gamba. It breaks in mobile and registers my vote several times lol
[8:18:00] Thommenius: And usually if the 15min ff doesn't work, the person might start throwing and you lose due to that, not because you inherently lost by skill
[8:18:41] Ghostloon: true true
[8:18:58] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[8:19:07] vogue_hommes: what's the point HUH
[8:19:12] voidmoons: eye appeal
[8:19:16] Thommenius: Status symbol
[8:19:31] irritatedunicorn: It's usually not even real gold
[8:19:32] vogue_hommes: golden poops monkaHmm
[8:19:56] Raktagino: I bet you are loved by your parents <3
[8:20:22] Senyuno: ty same

[8:21:10] Raktagino: those are huge
[8:21:20] voidmoons: they just get freezerburnt
[8:21:42] vogue_hommes: monkaS
[8:22:09] voidmoons: freezing just reminds me of ur soup era
[8:22:14] voidmoons: while u were getting sick
[8:22:20] Raktagino: yes
[8:22:21] voidmoons: yee

[8:22:41] egirl_janna_uwu: wouldnt it get freezer burnt
[8:22:45] softlysupports: i would but i wouldnt be excited about it
[8:22:55] TwitchTime89: same
[8:22:56] unseated9: its only bad if it rots so thats why there is dry age and freezer stuff from months and even year
[8:23:07] TwitchTime89: but not much over a year
[8:23:09] Thommenius: I'd sus it too much, might be okay but too hesitant to eat
[8:23:11] RodNimrod: people buy (butchered) cows whole and eat them throughout the year
[8:23:22] irritatedunicorn: In catering you're not supposed to cook frozen things after 3 months I think (in th uk)? It's been a while since I worked in a kitchen
[8:23:52] ash_chiming: ekko!
[8:23:54] Thommenius: @irritatedunicorn I've heard the same in europe
[8:23:54] vogue_hommes: senna slayyy
[8:23:54] TwitchTime89: i'd smell it if it looks ok, and then if it looks and smells ok i would eat it, but the SLIGHTEST hint of a bad smell, it's in the garbage!
[8:23:58] ash_chiming: an ap assassin lol
[8:24:10] softlysupports: twitchtime projec576Hey
[8:24:11] TwitchTime89: they say three months on google too, but i don't throw meat out after three months
