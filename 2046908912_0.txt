[3:23:10] Sentety: OxTailSafu example the boss fight in Chapter 12 is 18 levels above you cause you're always pretty much scripted to get to chapter 12 at lvl 31-33 and it is possible to beat em but its gonna take you like maybe 20-30 minutes unless you grind elaKek
[3:23:16] syntherz: except for the story, I feel like the gameplay doesn't change much from 0 to 6, and 7 to 8 tho, so I choose 0 and 8 LUL
[3:24:18] Frickenfrack: does he have movement speed tune
[3:24:21] Frickenfrack: rune
[3:25:28] Sentety: syntherz 0 had the best combat until the spin off games came out judgment and lost judgement and a few months ago Like a Dragon gaiden which they basically perfected the Beat em up combat with actual fighting game juggling and combos

[3:30:44] saw141: @ugotnosauce Technically like Gold-Plat is pretty well above average but I think what most people would consider "high elo" is like D4+. Then you have some players that would only consider Master+ as High Elo.
