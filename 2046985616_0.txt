[0:23:20] Graphwize: so if money wasn’t a factor you wouldn’t play league?
[0:23:26] Overmonitorw: !meta build
[0:23:26] StreamElements: During GTA V meta is telling the streamer something their character did not learn in game. Do not META!

[0:25:04] youngespresso: well thats ranked, casual normal games arent too bad
[0:25:12] DaoUnchained: brunchmenus i considered it but I would probably eat my hat with that ping ._.

[0:26:39] Chrisssan: are you still playing in KR server? they love being racist over there
[0:26:50] cableguy23: arena was fun as fuck
[0:26:51] danniellos: this is why I stopped playing league lmao
[0:27:03] uPantcho: mr sep, instead of playing you can stream coaching others, you will still make money and wont have to play EZ i volunteer as a tribute to get your free coaching Kappa
[0:27:05] youngespresso: like how u will NEVER play off stream
[0:27:06] xxcaptspazxx: Watching league makes me want to play league. Playing league makes me not want to play league
[0:27:08] mentoscoolcandy: 6 years so...season 14-6= season 8
[0:27:09] Graphwize: when you started off streaming and youtube did you enjoy the game though?
[0:27:29] freedomnestoras: Why don't you play other games like you 've been doing some time ago
[0:27:29] brunchmenus: you wanna try coaching me? :p

[0:27:35] mentoscoolcandy: you hated  the game since season 8? season 8 is the runes rework right
[0:27:36] bossofhalo: ya pretty much. love the streaming. unfortunailty league is prob one of the best game to stream view-wise I assume.
[0:27:48] Screemingtofu: just do intermissions. 5-10 min between games sometimes. if interacting with audience is what u love, then make room for it.
[0:27:52] cableguy23: I enjoy the occasional aram and esports
[0:27:54] danniellos: games are so unbalanced, also riot saying they will change anything with that and they do nothing
[0:27:56] nerves8: they need to bring back arena tbh
[0:27:58] brunchmenus: league used to be fun as fuck
[0:28:02] brunchmenus: like 5 season ago
[0:28:21] youngespresso: they started changing it when they reduced ff20 to 15
[0:28:38] bossofhalo: huh, you might like the new game called Palworld.
[0:28:39] uPantcho: some mobas are time capped at 10min Kappa
[0:28:57] brunchmenus: Sadge
[0:29:03] xxmcmillan: Games in league always feel coinflippy now
[0:29:27] uPantcho: bullsep had decent numbers Kappa
[0:29:28] Walrus14: 100% agree, I remember back in the day you could actually take a game to 40 min and make epic comebacks
[0:29:35] freedomnestoras: So you are taking breaks by playing other games
[0:29:36] cableguy23: Streaming seems hard cause no pension/retirement
[0:30:01] Dazzelem: do you at least like this season more than last or no difference
[0:30:01] brunchmenus: watch em do another durability patch
[0:30:02] bossofhalo: surprised people think you are pissy right now, they haven't been here long enough to see you throw your mouse at the wall. lol
[0:30:04] Scarors: yea but at the same time people will be complaining for them not trying new things
[0:30:22] SeanonymousGaming: SeanonymousGaming subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:30:23] Alexoaguia: Yeah, even on 40 minutes games it didn't feel that bad even on a loss
[0:30:27] Okayzz: It feels kinda weird playing a tank and just feel like all your items dont do anything and just get oneshotXD
[0:31:04] uPantcho: you play thydra and now you dont get one shot maybe just buy better items Kappa
[0:31:17] jian87: why did the chickens runs to graves in the bush and out of vision?
[0:31:19] somecasualplayer: Im very sorry you have to play this game. You do deserve happiness and consistency, I wish it wasn’t the way it was.
[0:31:29] brunchmenus: thats actually not bad for a light week
[0:31:38] brunchmenus: or whatever the time span wa
[0:31:39] brunchmenus: s
[0:31:57] Chrisssan: that's just 20 hr below standard monthly work hours
[0:32:15] brunchmenus: im not addicted, i just hate myself :)
[0:32:23] uPantcho: @Chrisssan this is only true for february Kappa
[0:32:31] darkmatter709: U do the work so we don't have to
[0:32:40] Chrisssan: not only are we addicted, we are bad at it as well XD

[0:33:59] cptschnooks: I enjoy league but I just come for your commentary
[0:34:12] bossofhalo: I tried playing rust one time, didn't let me use any of my mice cause apparently they ban them from the game.

[0:35:33] BrazilReignsSupreme: If you had a big D, would you do OF as a side hustle
[0:35:54] cableguy23: I want to move but sounds scary/really close to family
[0:35:57] jian87: what would you play if there was something else you could stream getting the same viewership?
[0:35:59] UnStupified: s4?
[0:35:59] xxcaptspazxx: whats the rest of the build after tiamat?
[0:36:14] DaoUnchained: graves balls ain't as big as he thinks they are
[0:37:01] Bix_66: do you have a "normal" job in kr?
[0:37:04] bossofhalo: Jian76 pretty sure if he got the same amount of viewers and money, it would be rust. lol
[0:37:35] saxtherr: saxtherr watched 5 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! yo
[0:37:36] DaoUnchained: he'd get burnt out on rust too
[0:37:44] ficulus: where you leave now?

[0:38:21] brunchmenus: With pics
[0:38:48] brunchmenus: MERICA FUCK YEAH
[0:38:55] Chrisssan: how can you sstream after twitch KR leaves? korea is heavily censored to follow gov't sanctioned products only
[0:39:04] nightscl2: streaming rust is fine, 30 second delay. I’d watch more then I do for league.
[0:39:19] xxcaptspazxx: If you could be the best in the world at any skill (sport, instrument, whistling, whatever) what would you choose?
[0:39:25] 12gokhan1862: 30 sec delay wont work
[0:39:41] chinese_motorcycle: rust is sometimes boring to watch tho no?
[0:39:49] chinese_motorcycle: walking for 30 minutes at a time
[0:40:15] brunchmenus: It's about the journey not the time spent ;p

[0:40:54] nightscl2: I play with a prominent streamer….. 1 minute delay or 0 delay and we wing it
[0:41:09] nightscl2: sometimes playing against the stream snipers creates more and better content
[0:41:42] brunchmenus: fr tho, its looking nice on mobile now
[0:42:12] brunchmenus: yeah, you gotta be entertaing too
[0:42:14] office_phrog: i remember when the buffs had those little guys next to em
[0:42:36] vaggosgrec0: How old are y?
[0:42:36] Chrisssan: Dyrus never talks when he streams. that guy was not entertaining by any means
[0:42:52] cptschnooks: you just gotta convince people whatever your doing is interesting
[0:42:57] 12gokhan1862: mmo s are by far the worst genre to stream
[0:43:04] office_phrog: Dyrus mega fell off
[0:43:09] office_phrog: and he went to apex for a bit
[0:43:13] 渣古拉: Yeah like you have to play in such a way that people think you are crazy but somehow it works.
[0:43:16] nightscl2: been a fan for a long time cowsep…. I’d love to play a rust wipe with you haha
[0:43:25] axelero25: How many cow ourfits do you have b the way? It just came to my mind. Been watching you for years, doesnt it wear off?
[0:43:35] nightscl2: I’ve been watching you for at least 4 years now and I’ve played rust for 6 lol
[0:43:50] Y0UTU8E2012: Playing league with friends is the best way to lose them
[0:44:15] uPantcho: ksanti magical adventure

[0:44:38] 12gokhan1862: @Y0UTU8E2012 not if you are not toxic
[0:44:54] xxcaptspazxx: @渣古拉 funny looking maybe
[0:45:07] JyuVioleGrace: Generally you need to be very good at what you do/be entertaining or a mix of both. That said streaming is a lot of work.
[0:45:18] nightscl2: dyrus attracts tons of new people wiuf
[0:45:21] supt0: suppose you are playing with your friends it reduces your interaction with your viewers but sometimes its fun to watch other people having fun
[0:45:31] Y0UTU8E2012: lol

[0:49:24] nightscl2: be consistent
[0:49:25] hyperionentropic: He lives in korea
[0:49:26] Chrisssan: @etereamente_musica why do you think she has so many incels? cuz shes a female
[0:49:38] nightscl2: when did you do rust ???
[0:49:46] katzboom: what do people do in rust anyway? griefing other players?
[0:49:49] NotASkiller: why his game isn't in korean

[0:52:16] supt0: https://clips.twitch.tv/QuaintLongAlfalfaMcaT-IExcPx4YxxCndxVT
[0:52:26] Chrisssan: im pretty sure purchasing a service from a hooker has 1000x more substantial value than watching female streamers
[0:52:28] Jasure: this draven is tooo fed lmao, he's shredding your entire team
[0:52:34] brunchmenus: i can see the clips :0
[0:52:49] office_phrog: im sure you get this a lot but do you think you could find a champ in league rn that youd have more fun with?
[0:52:51] UnStupified: ziggs is not the move in the burst meta
[0:53:25] brunchmenus: i think ziggs has alot of potential but as the bot carry

[1:24:29] ckodsa: so let's hack him EZ
[1:24:31] brunchmenus: I'm liking how its doing 👌
[1:24:49] Cheeseers48: Did you do web stuff before now?
[1:24:55] brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd: can I use chat gpt to make me good at league of legends
[1:24:59] ckodsa: Venoshii was my first
[1:25:11] ckodsa: 6Head
[1:25:31] ckodsa: first viewer u got from veno? xD
[1:25:31] brunchmenus: Learning from yt can be a pain
[1:26:40] wagnar93: i did my first chat bot in telegram. you dont even need to rite codes there
[1:26:41] wagnar93: so easy
[1:27:19] orphantears23: @Cowsep hey man what is a jungler thats close to master yi style of jungling
[1:27:54] brunchmenus: One minor detail that'd be great for my ocd is if for mobile you move the chat and video player to the left by a couple pixels 👍
[1:27:55] dneolitzb: Programming is easy if you take it step by step
[1:28:19] funky_pantss: @dneolitzb is it<
[1:28:22] funky_pantss: ?
[1:28:23] wagnar93: ai is scary
[1:29:26] Cheeseers48: Pretty sweet dude
[1:29:35] styroslol: @Cowsep if enemy who losing to me saying " yi champ for noobs " , why my enemy doesn't pick yi? I mean... Only noobs lose, right? 🤨
[1:29:46] dneolitzb: @funky_pantss Yes. You just need to learn the basics. Everything complicated has been already made by someone else and uploaded so you can copy and learn from. It's just experience to do things faster after the basics
[1:29:59] wagnar93: my first experience with gpt was, i asked it waht is the difference between the french revoulution and todays woke culture, it replied "how much time you have?"
[1:30:39] funky_pantss: I love lol players :D they are at 5% health and decides not to go back, then dies...obviously and then question marks in chat :D like "why did I die?" lol
[1:30:51] dneolitzb: It does help a lot to have someone who can help if you get stuck
[1:31:50] brunchmenus: I can figure out my phone model if that matters
[1:31:51] bcharlesw24: @Cowsep when r u gonna play ad twisted fate my guy
[1:31:55] wagnar93: that did not hit you man wtf

[1:32:34] bcharlesw24: @Cowsep what about ap StinkyGlitch
[1:32:43] wagnar93: yeah i agree
[1:32:50] tarm0i: chat what's the best yi build nowawdays i just came here
[1:33:31] wagnar93: yeah i can imagine, i always thought best way to start is the api
[1:33:38] tarm0i: JESUS THE REACTION TIME ON THAT Q DODGE
[1:33:49] dneolitzb: DAYUM
[1:33:49] funky_pantss: @tarm0i cowsep has a guide on the latest yi builds on his youtube chanel, you should check it out
[1:33:59] real_mersault: DAAAAAAAAAAAAANG
[1:34:03] 1GlC: can you play AP yi pls :)
[1:34:05] brunchmenus: i should start using chatgpt probably
[1:34:16] Nexudor: Is yi good right now or what tier would u place him in jng?
[1:34:28] dneolitzb: Never trust ChatGPT 100% though, always test
[1:34:32] wagnar93: gbt is great
[1:34:34] dneolitzb: and confirm
[1:34:35] brunchmenus: yeah thats true
[1:34:39] stormy_pride: it really is useful, helps a ton
[1:34:47] stormy_pride: but its code is sometimes a little shiet
[1:34:50] wagnar93: why didnt the r do dmg?
[1:34:55] stormy_pride: so some base knowledge is needed
[1:34:56] 1GlC: is karthus good? :)
[1:35:30] Skaglicker: @wagnar93 pressed W
[1:35:43] wagnar93: that w was lighting fast i dint even see
[1:35:53] dneolitzb: @stormy_pride You can always break it down. It's just the less knowledge you have, the harder is it do break it down and understand what it is doing
[1:35:54] stormy_pride: it does give you great barebones and different avenues
[1:36:12] stormy_pride: yeah thats what i have done, its nice you can highlight the code and be like what does this do
[1:36:19] brunchmenus: true. how are you supposed to know what something is if you dont know what it is
[1:36:22] wagnar93: yeah we do syberscurity trainings every 3 month on my company
[1:36:23] tarm0i: can u use chatGPT for free legit way?
[1:36:27] stormy_pride: and it generally seems to give a decent way to analyze it
[1:36:46] stormy_pride: @tarm0i 3.5 is free
[1:37:06] stormy_pride: everyone has to start somewhere smile right?
[1:37:27] dneolitzb: So Hydra now has an active like in the old days?
[1:37:45] bummerrrang: whats the free verison called?
[1:37:50] stormy_pride: chatgpt
[1:37:52] dneolitzb: Or Tiamat*
[1:37:59] SadeqD1: chatgpfree
[1:38:02] wagnar93: if you want to see one of the best generative ai stuff try Picsart app
[1:38:10] wagnar93: no advertizing intended
[1:38:30] stormy_pride: maybe i should look more into the paid model
[1:38:30] leumas203: Isn't chatgpt way too dumb now?
[1:38:37] stormy_pride: have only ever used free
[1:38:55] wagnar93: noo gbt 4 is abeast
[1:39:18] bummerrrang: have u seen the one when interview. that helps you to answer the questions
[1:39:24] wagnar93: are you gonna buld the blue hydra?
[1:39:38] wagnar93: oh its the titanic ok mb
[1:39:45] stormy_pride: using chatgpt is just kinda like googling
[1:39:58] stormy_pride: if you ask it too broad of things you get too broad of responses
[1:40:04] kingsalot31: isnt ai dangerous
[1:40:09] zombozo7012: isn't bard better than chatgpt?
[1:40:14] funky_pantss: you just have to know how to use it
[1:40:15] wabitgirl: kingsalot31 no
[1:40:25] wagnar93: cmone its not skynet :D :D
[1:40:32] heterochrome: garbage input garbage output Kappa
[1:40:36] wabitgirl: kingsalot31 it's problematic in a lot of ways, but that's because of how it's being used, not because it's inherently dangerous
[1:40:39] kingsalot31: @wabitgirl been seeing it is taking artist jobs or sometrhin
[1:40:47] leumas203: i used to use for uni last year, but now i feel like it is just way worse
[1:41:01] dneolitzb: @kingsalot31 It is. Not close to as dangerous as it is portrayed to be, though
[1:41:03] wagnar93: one weird thing i found about gpt is it kinda doenst know html
[1:41:23] uPantcho: the best kind of correct
[1:41:33] wabitgirl: kingsalot31 right, because companies decided it's cheaper to use chatgpt to generate base images and have people alter them than to actually pay artists to render things from scratch.
[1:41:38] dneolitzb: F
[1:41:42] wagnar93: unlucky
[1:41:47] uPantcho: cowsep and early smites, name a more iconic duo
[1:42:01] uPantcho: why you always smite above the smite range? Kappa
[1:42:01] wabitgirl: kingsalot31 it's not GPTs fault that money grubbing capitalists are willing to use it to exploit or fire artists.
[1:42:05] Dablyfe: reaction time does go down as you age bro
[1:42:09] ckodsa: old age is catching up
[1:42:10] Dablyfe: you old fucker :P
[1:42:10] tarm0i: why u insecure with ur reaction time ur a beast just try to w his burst by reaction
[1:42:12] wabitgirl: kingsalot31 the engine itself is super cool
[1:42:29] wagnar93: wouldnt the lethality hydra be better?
[1:42:43] uPantcho: smite: does 600 damage. cowsep: smites at 660. smite: does 900 damage, cowsep: smites at 980. smite: does 1200 damage. cowsep: smites at 1203
[1:42:49] CrusherStrife: what are u buildinmg with the ap?
[1:43:40] brunchmenus: if it were reversed i bet they would have bounties
[1:44:03] wagnar93: boosted katrhus
[1:44:04] wagnar93: :D
[1:44:07] heterochrome: exhausting master yi on R i0kiLUL
[1:44:08] stormy_pride: Okay league question Cowsep, is yi a good beginner jungler?
[1:44:13] tarm0i: HAHAHAHA

[1:44:46] Neithan3: Phantom dancer seems like a cheap and better guinso imo. Plus crit
[1:44:56] stormy_pride: perfect, shall use yi to learn
[1:45:02] wabitgirl: stormy_pride his entry skill barrier is pretty low. He's, at his core, a click and attack champ with a good gap closer and a couple of good buffs, slow negation, and a damage reduction and heal
[1:45:09] CrusherStrife: hey cow, what's ur opinion on palworld?
[1:45:22] wabitgirl: stormy_pride he also scales well with skill, as there's a lot of little thingsd you can do with him, like dodge globals and skill shots with his Q, auto reset with W, etc.
[1:45:29] stormy_pride: @wabitgirl oh man tyvm for the description <3

[3:37:31] SleepyBunny1995: if it's anything like valorant's vanguard, all the scripters are going to find it MUCH HARDER to play in game
[3:37:36] SleepyBunny1995: :  3
[3:37:46] Demiurgo13S: why titanic first, is it better than bork first?
[3:37:46] DredgePhantom: @SleepyBunny1995 its exactly the same vanguard
[3:37:48] thesmurfyone: Have I been baited....or is there really a breakthru build? :o
[3:37:56] SleepyBunny1995: @DredgePhantom yup gg scripters
[3:38:26] ripstr0ke: yeah but vanguard is a literal rootkit that gives kernel 0 access to it and tencent, which is weird

[4:24:20] Jon71trick: what was he thinking
[4:24:20] ripstr0ke: cowRip
[4:24:40] YourRin: @Cowsep At lvl9 with adaptive runes. Titatnic gives 29 dmg and 58 on the passiv cleave. With doble flat health, hyrda gives 30 dmg, 61 on cleave. So you are indeed correct. The early dmg is absolutely neglible. It scales better and youre tankier.
[4:25:12] YourRin: Ima check that too quickly
[4:25:21] brunchmenus: i dont even feel the ad scale on pet tbh
[4:25:46] Ikkarrow: so what 1 more auto early
