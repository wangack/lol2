[1:15:43] Mooie: bramble ez
[1:15:44] socialmediaslave: steraks prio
[1:15:55] reissuuu: I would say Maw is better because of the lifesteal when procs and this way sylas+lilia can't burst u down and also the stats are good dmg wise
[1:16:18] memer_ng: Man have you thought about playing Path of Exile
[1:16:31] Krashy_v2: get rookerm then man
[1:16:40] reissuuu: But u can sustain urself better during the fight i would say
[1:16:47] GhetsisRS: rookern better here imo
[1:16:56] reissuuu: Even nami does some ap dmg so u can counter nami lilia sylas and the ad build of tf also does some mix ap dmg

[1:18:01] WeaponSupplier: did say u jinxed it and would lose 3 first games lol
[1:18:03] ginnymonster: everyone else ccing you but no dmg then lucian does 1 round of abilities on you
[1:18:04] memer_ng: You need anti-burst. Deaths dance might be a solid option
[1:18:15] reissuuu: mhh maybe deathdance no? Its anti burst and gives armor or even GA instead of the frozen? But Frozen also counters the autos of twisted fate, but to synergize better it would be needed tabi i would say
[1:18:29] erzokk: time to invest in armour
[1:19:02] StreamElements: If you like what you see, consider subscribing to the channel, a little from a lot of people is a lot, and allow me to do what I do, thank you so much <3 https://secure.twitch.tv/products/sick_nerd/ticket?ref=below_video_subscribe_button
[1:19:04] Jubling_: flash is such a crutch
[1:19:31] reissuuu: Well if he melts ,i dont think armor is gonna do the job, we are to deep in the game, armor pen will be made as well, death dance for sure the best item
[1:19:40] memer_ng: Death dance or Frozen heart is what id go in this situation. armor isnt gonna help

[1:21:29] RakustD: Any flashers in chat?
[1:21:37] testplayer457: lmao rakust
[1:21:47] memer_ng: Your sustain is your damage, the longer you're on top of them and keeping your q stacks the more damage you're gonna be able to pump
[1:21:52] reissuuu: you need damage ,at this point if u go in on someone u need to be abble to kill him even if u die for it , but at the point u currently are u can't do that
[1:21:54] erzokk: yes
[1:21:58] testplayer457: i use flash so much with kayn to jump on people or towerdive

[1:23:20] Twillz: she level 14 lmao
[1:23:31] IDazza69: people who report for bad plays are scum of the earth
[1:23:33] Mooie: 20-7 lead
[1:23:33] reissuuu: Tbh u guys forced to many fights that had no possible outcome to the game, objectives were down and u guys ended up dieing on those bad fights giving bounties and they scaled
[1:23:37] Oakateer: Lost focus after the rift fuck up I think
[1:23:40] Oda_hairstyle: unlucky mate go next
[1:23:42] RakustD: Back to birdhouse runs

[1:25:46] Twillz: just gotta let people make mistakes instead of trying to save them
[1:25:52] Jason73: the stream before tho you were 1-9
[1:25:52] reissuuu: Well i enter'd late but what i noticed u just forced or either to save or foce fights on mid like 2-3 times, at this point of the game u should be looking to kill lilia on theire jungle and shove side lanes so u can rotate to help your team and take objectives to push the lead, most times its best to let ur team int if they are on a bad position
[1:25:55] klatterbox: sure u can KEKW
[1:26:03] Mooie: Chatting

[1:30:51] klatterbox: is jg canyon toxic or banter?
[1:30:53] games_told_not_sold: Is diamond the best rank
[1:31:08] reissuuu: @damse If you have more minions than the enemy yours is either fast pushing or slow pushing ,if you have the same or 1 minion of its basicly a freeze/slowpush, if you shove at correct times the wave crashes and bounces back, the bounce back means the next wave if u dont touch it will ALLWAYS end under your tower , so its best time to roam and come back to farm safe under tower
[1:31:11] Twillz: diamond is top 1% but its still pretty bad
[1:31:12] emmy_jade334: hey
[1:31:17] jianjinhai: anything below master 500lp is low elo no cap

[1:34:34] TusenLapp1: Enjoy the shithole that's called Diamond 4, it's a utter wank rank, because nobody fucking cares anymore because "i'm diamond, i won hit masters, so this is fine"
[1:34:39] reissuuu: @bailey_desu  maybe if you want i can pass you my discord so we can just review some games whenever ur free
[1:34:44] TusenLapp1: wont*
[1:34:46] Darkal_: purpp plays nunu :)
[1:35:06] testplayer457: @reissuuu what i like to do is if they are not like in need of help instantly and ur real close u can clear your jungle , then you check how the waves is pushing and decide if its a pretty garanted kill to get or not, many junglers say  they gank alot but they are not getting any kills.
[1:35:16] testplayer457: you always have to check if its a gankable time
[1:35:24] shoeys: purpp plays nunu cause of the young boy
[1:35:38] reissuuu: @TusenLapp1 Even challenger players say that diamond its hard to get out because of that, if you reach d4 with 80% w/r and u get losers queue you are finitly 100% gonna have your w/r lower into prob 60-70% before reaching master
[1:35:39] testplayer457: with waves , does your team have health or mana to help you? are they close to the enemy ?
[1:35:55] testplayer457: is the minion wave big ? early on they shit gonna hurt
[1:36:00] barragee: @reissuuu what is this fake info
[1:36:26] elfbosque: saving E was 5Head
[1:36:32] Mooie: HUH
[1:36:33] testplayer457: might not be worth to gank for exemple top if the wave is huge for your teammate as he might end up losing alot of xp or gold on the minions even if yo get the kill.
[1:36:45] TusenLapp1: I had about 80% WR getting to d4 @reissuuu now everything is 100% coinflip, very hard to do anything about it because there's always one rtard that just doesnt care anymore
[1:36:57] reissuuu: @bailey_desu Well i see the ganking part maybe im not avoiding wards correctly or not choosing the best aproach for the gank, i try to review that and i improved a bit on that, but i also think i lack ganks , i am certain that i could pressure or gank more ,even if i only gank to get less pressure on a lane ( shove waves, garantee my laners a back so maybe we can have item advantage for a drak eetc )
[1:37:05] Zorgup: All he needed was ur moral support Kappa

[1:37:56] Zonii: essaying
[1:37:59] testplayer457: @reissuuu forsure
[1:38:00] reissuuu: @TusenLapp1 I think there was a challenger player that got stuck with negative w/r on emerald and diamond on a smurf account because of how bad the state of the coinflips are there lul
[1:38:02] adstar: Chatting
[1:38:08] disturbedwhirpool: @TusenLapp1 Consider it might be because Diamond players are better than Plat players
[1:38:18] reissuuu: he is comming guys
[1:38:18] IDazza69: pardon?
[1:38:19] TheSwunk: He's comig Kreygasm
[1:38:22] NohelpforIM: HUH
[1:38:27] testplayer457: @reissuuu your main objectives is to take the jungle objectives tho as a jungler remember that , the dragons and voids is pretty damn huge for your team
[1:38:32] SolasR6: JoelDefend
[1:38:39] testplayer457: @reissuuu its not to secue that your team dont feed , they cant blame you if they are inting
[1:38:42] ChicityLoL: hopped on stream just to see 0-2 KEKW
[1:38:52] SolasR6: went on a work call and now we're 0-2 x0r6ztGiggle

[1:39:05] barragee: twitch chat always spreading fake challenger lore KEKW
[1:39:07] testplayer457: anyways imma have to go to the gym ill cya guys later
[1:39:20] elfbosque: amumu inting
[1:39:24] reissuuu: @bailey_desu I agree with that , but i think the main jungler role is actualy reduce risks, and doing this by taking the objectives ( we reduce theire objectives taht give stats making us have higher chances of winning , and also helping the laners to have a lead or protecting them from ganks and roams )
[1:39:24] adstar: @IDazza69 his sylas did it
[1:39:45] IDazza69: oh lol
[1:39:49] TusenLapp1: @disturbedwhirpool well. it shouldn't matter when i have a WR of 80%, and the difference really isnt that big from emerald to low diamond, i could understand it if i was d2 or d1 but not in d4.
[1:40:07] Izzu__: Chatting
[1:40:16] VVABBIT: Silver back
[1:40:18] TusenLapp1: @reissuuu Yeah i mean, probably bad example but Bausffs was stuck quite some time i emerald i believe
[1:40:21] shoeys: Chatting
[1:40:25] JustinMeijer: you gymed?
[1:40:40] reissuuu: @TusenLapp1  u can easly get to plat emerald or even diamond with even 90% w/r if you really aim for that , just go brand new account that starts on iron and just try hard everygame, u will end up being emerald 4 with d1/d2 mmr with like 80%+ w/r
[1:40:51] RakustD: !load
[1:40:59] reissuuu: @TusenLapp1 well wanna know who got hardstuck emerald to? Have u seen kesha last season? xDDDD
