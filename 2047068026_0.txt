[1:06:24] Brenoou_: @iwanttoplaysettbetter_123 I'll have to disagree, he's basically a Sett otp, he plays Darius and Mordekaiser cause:  1st Sett isnt a strong champion these past few metas, and 2nd Darius and Mordekaiser are just much stronger and much better into certain matchups

[1:06:53] Brenoou_: what we actually need is skin emotes @AutolykusLoL
[1:06:53] iwanttoplaysettbetter_123: @Brenoou_ oh ok
[1:07:32] Brenoou_: @iwanttoplaysettbetter_123 he's known for his Sett and the champion so in the end it just makes sense that the emotes are all related to Sett

[1:15:21] Ichib4n_: I've never even seen a wingstop
[1:15:34] SavannahChan: WHAT?
[1:15:48] Ichib4n_: Honestly you could just take whatever calories you need to bulk @iwanttoplaysettbetter_123
[1:16:00] Ichib4n_: Chinese food is really good for bulking since they have a lot of oils and such in their food
[1:16:22] iwanttoplaysettbetter_123: @Ichib4n_ yh but sometimes i eat a lot then the next day almost nothinf
[1:16:22] Ichib4n_: one tablespoon of any cooking oil is like 200 calories already so imagine like a full meal xD
[1:16:27] iwanttoplaysettbetter_123: nothing*
[1:16:33] Ichib4n_: Just gotta stay consistent with it
[1:16:41] iwanttoplaysettbetter_123: yh thats kinda the problem
[1:17:15] iwanttoplaysettbetter_123: plus i dont want to spend my pocket money on food for now
[1:17:23] Ichib4n_: Yeah I felt that, I've been meal prepping for the last month to lose weight and one day I like couldn't do it and ended up eating 4 days of food LOL

[1:21:17] label939: five guys is so good but very expensive
[1:21:20] Ichib4n_: unless you meant in n out
