[1:38:34] Vogter_: Yeah been following you since the early Coast TSM days. But good to see you streaming again
[1:38:39] imKroMo: i guarantee you it's almost the same, I work with all remote team, and we meet sometimes. Pretty much the same (not league team, just software developement company)
[1:40:02] imKroMo: thank you for your opinion, super appreciate
[1:40:40] arthalie: Is there any pick from your career you expected to become meta but didnt?
[1:44:18] nwa4lifeTV: jax taking your grubs DansGame
[1:45:06] Monkeydluffy44: for you we gonna smash the dia team in prime league
[1:45:10] Monkeydluffy44: u gave me hope :D
[1:45:24] cowiiiie: not much gold for grubs but xp is super nice for jax
[1:46:11] Vogter_: I'm off to play my promo games, see you my man
[1:46:20] Vogter_: santorinFine
[1:47:58] nwa4lifeTV: stop bullying teemo BibleThump
[1:48:12] ajak636: what if the enemy support picked a different tank support do ezreal and zyra still lose?
[1:48:43] imKroMo: why no shoes buy here?
[1:48:54] cowiiiie: does q'ing out of base make you go any quicker? i know your W does
[1:49:34] Tritros: they have no synergy together so the lane is pretty awful
[1:50:44] mkramer2000: Yo Santorini how have the games been?
[1:50:44] Mounizle: seems like EUW soloq is just as much a fiesta as NA is
[1:50:50] Mounizle: especially when it comes to these players mentral
[1:50:59] Mounizle: mental
[1:51:03] Mounizle: nt LOL
[1:51:08] arthalie: Did you see the Superliga game from last week where the mid jg tried to wintrade and failed lol
[1:51:20] Tritros: that was a tilter of a gank
[1:51:21] Mounizle: didn't they get punished for that
[1:51:26] Mounizle: i think i saw a tweet about it
[1:51:36] mkramer2000: It's only the first couple of games. Gotta warmup
[1:53:10] Tritros: this game is looking kind of over but maybe you can carry
[1:53:33] Jaaammer: u almost jinxed him there
[1:53:41] Jaaammer: nvm u jinxed him
[1:53:49] Mounizle: LOL
[1:53:56] nwa4lifeTV: where his triforce or sunder
[1:57:45] DrewGamer: @nwa4lifeTV sunderer is gone, I've seen a lot of Ezreals going Essence Reaver lately. Maybe Trinity is weak right now?
[1:57:56] nwa4lifeTV: i meant for jax brah
[1:58:41] DrewGamer: You didn't specify brah :P
[1:59:03] GhostxxHorse: this song is a bop
[2:00:41] nwa4lifeTV: rip
[2:00:45] Mounizle: LMAO
[2:00:46] Khitchary_: life is cruel
[2:00:48] wygFishkiller: this teemo is evil
[2:00:59] wygFishkiller: worse than a shaco main
[2:02:00] H0nkeyD0nkey: @Santorin is yi a challenger champ? i don't really see anyone play him on stream.
[2:02:55] DrewGamer: I love watching people try to dodge ezreal Qs and he just auto's them to death xD
[2:02:56] eric440: cowcep moment
[2:03:06] TimeWizardLuL: Cowsep
[2:03:18] H0nkeyD0nkey: cowsep is not top tier
[2:03:29] H0nkeyD0nkey: nothing against him by any means
[2:03:35] exilev9: @Santorin did you try future's market/cosmic on lillia?
[2:03:51] H0nkeyD0nkey: @Santorin you know i appreciate you answering questions. thank you very much for the quality interaction
[2:04:22] tugwos: @H0nkeyD0nkey Sinerias is the yi player
[2:04:25] Arslaaan: !opgg
[2:04:26] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Santorini%20Panini-EUW & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/SantariniPanini-JGDIF & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/ChatDisabler97-MUTE
[2:04:52] PigeonSenti: this was awkward
[2:04:59] Cyonnis: The 5 man sleep into no follow up
[2:05:16] Khadezz: but they didnt wanna fight under tower
[2:05:21] imKroMo: is elise good this patch? do you know similar champion to her play-style?
[2:05:23] tomi_barra: the 9 man sleep LUL
[2:05:39] Velraptured: Think you're playing the wrong champ if you want to always go forward. I think that's a Xin/J4 angle.
[2:05:47] tomi_barra: You slept your team too
[2:06:01] H0nkeyD0nkey: @tugwos i was just interested in seeing yi gameplay in challenger, how would that character do in high game play. i haven't seen him in LCS or anything like that in the past season
[2:07:01] Mounizle: LOL
[2:07:01] DrewGamer: #JustAkshanThings
[2:07:22] tugwos: @H0nkeyD0nkey Sinerias is a challenger yi player who streams, so you can check him out to see how yi is doing currently
[2:07:36] imbatty: Its just 5head plays, how many other people have revived you this game?
[2:07:39] DrewGamer: @Velraptured Vi is also pretty good about always going forward NODDERS
[2:07:54] Velraptured: @DrewGamer I was memeing, it's one of their ingame quotes.
[2:07:56] eric440: @H0nkeyD0nkey I mean I'd say korean master is pretty good but I guess we just have different standards
[2:08:46] H0nkeyD0nkey: @eric440 i agree, im in a terrible elo. i just haven't seen any challenger type yi plays and strats is all
[2:08:51] HalcyonDays: 8 less people than Spica FeelsBadMan
[2:09:39] DrewGamer: @Velraptured damn, the joke went over my head LUL
[2:10:50] DrewGamer: isn't Akshan supposed to stay alive to revive everyone? I feel like he was doing it wrong there.
[2:11:24] Monkeydluffy44: how u feel about rell or seju jgl?
[2:12:11] nwa4lifeTV: high elo u play for comp and not just what champ u want to play?
[2:12:26] Monkeydluffy44: yh for prime league especially
[2:13:46] Monkeydluffy44: what is a good flex pick?
[2:14:15] Velraptured: @DrewGamer Eh I mean if you don't play the champs you probably wouldn't even recognize it. I've been muting off and on so I don't know if he even responded but I'm guessing not, lul
[2:15:33] rngulol: use Leagueofgraph to check peak
[2:16:11] Mounizle: majd is a cool dude
[2:16:18] builtylol: ur jax is chall player but hes a insane coinflip
[2:16:22] builtylol: either 20-0 or 0 20

[2:16:44] builtylol: yes
[2:16:45] HarryBlopper: ez win
[2:16:47] getsometalentloser: @santorin  what junglers do u hate and despise going against
[2:17:01] Khadezz: he tp mid
[2:17:09] Khadezz: with no one
[2:17:12] Khadezz: there and dies
[2:17:35] fightb4udie: who are some of ur favorite soloq midlaners?
[2:18:05] fightb4udie: players^^
[2:18:40] HarryBlopper: how often do you see the same people?
[2:18:42] HarryBlopper: every game?
[2:20:12] AlanTeemo: chat told me ure a teemo fan?
[2:20:20] getsometalentloser: ap ivern let’s go
[2:20:27] EdgedSilver: @santorin Morgana is pretty fun rn
[2:20:38] builtylol: its on red not blue right now
[2:21:10] AlanTeemo: when did you flash into a shroom
[2:21:17] AlanTeemo: i wanna check vod
[2:21:36] AlanTeemo: alright thanks good luck in soloq
[2:21:38] AlanTeemo: i didnt even notice
[2:21:40] AlanTeemo: suddenly had a tripple
[2:22:03] AlanTeemo: im in game
[2:22:07] HarryBlopper: @AlanTeemo what he is saying is ur not on his christmas card
[2:22:26] getsometalentloser: @santorin  look at nunus wr
[2:23:07] getsometalentloser: master +
[2:23:12] scorpionmkultra: good morning
[2:23:18] HarryBlopper: is zed jgl still viable?
[2:23:19] iiNumb3rz: Back from vacation and ready for some Santorini
[2:23:27] HarryBlopper: thats all kesha
[2:23:54] getsometalentloser: nah that’s tank nunu
[2:23:56] getsometalentloser: wr
[2:23:58] scorpionmkultra: i'm doing alright, hbu?
[2:24:14] iiNumb3rz: Do you think the dark harvest build is ever viable on graves or fleet just best?
[2:24:48] fightb4udie: any tips to not take losses too serious? it kinda ruins my mood even outside the game
[2:25:11] iiNumb3rz: Tried hubris on graves last night and did not enjoy it. I can't not have my ghostblade.
[2:25:42] iiNumb3rz: I think taking 100% accountability helps. If you look for reasons to blame the team it makes it worse.
[2:25:51] iiNumb3rz: Also mute chat.
[2:25:53] BleachIceCream: @fightb4udie just expect every game to be an awful game that way when it's a great game ur surprised and when the game is awful ur not surprised :)
[2:25:58] HarryBlopper: is it more important to review ur own games or others game?
[2:27:12] fightb4udie: thanks sant & chat !
[2:27:15] getsometalentloser: I’m still trying to find my self
[2:27:29] getsometalentloser: ivern and bell veth every game
[2:27:32] getsometalentloser: 😎
[2:27:39] solidussovis: @fightb4udie you should find goals IRL so that whatever happens in a game seems less important. A lot of the problem is you are putting to much self worth on a game. Life achievements>video game achievements
[2:28:02] Caendred: @santorin I do t see anyone building opportunity, why do you think is that? Gives Ability Haste, lethality, AD and a fuck ton of move speed @santorin
[2:28:34] HarryBlopper: is it more important to review ur own games or others game? 󠀀
[2:28:39] nwa4lifeTV: are u going to change your twitch profile picture?
[2:29:02] TimeWizardLuL: i enjoy the frustration
[2:29:28] iiNumb3rz: Don't try to emulate pro play though. It doesn't translate to solo q.
[2:29:37] iiNumb3rz: Your team will not play like theirs
[2:29:52] HarryBlopper: i usually watch people and emulate them and that kinda in itself eleminates my own mistakes @Santorin
[2:30:08] Sorips: i came to say hi from samira! he loves u! :D @Santorin
[2:30:12] TimeWizardLuL: whats the secret to carry inting teams in low elo?
[2:30:29] iiNumb3rz: @harryblopper santorin showed me starting chickens is viable on a lot of champs and I use it all the time now.
[2:30:57] iiNumb3rz: @timewizardlul play yone.
[2:31:10] HarryBlopper: @iiNumb3rz ye but i mainly play mid
[2:31:17] solidussovis: ADC so greedy there
[2:31:22] iiNumb3rz: Oh then play yone
[2:31:37] iiNumb3rz: You can just miss every skill shot then auto them to death
[2:31:58] HarryBlopper: @iiNumb3rz truue but i play zed mainly although he's only d tier atm
[2:32:23] iiNumb3rz: @santorin how bout that c9 bot lane dive yesterday?
[2:32:27] fightb4udie: @HarryBlopper zed jgl pretty nice atm tho
[2:32:31] fightb4udie: selfmade has some nice games on it and high wr
[2:34:46] HarryBlopper: zed jgl lacks cc i feel like
[2:35:02] kingfinesseya: what are your thoughts on Viego jungle
[2:35:45] Diamonddusts: Make sure you know how to play the other champs before you pick him xD
[2:36:13] nwa4lifeTV: hes mad at you after 3
[2:36:15] nwa4lifeTV: level 3
[2:36:31] scorpionmkultra: he has some balls or he's just that crazy voxyAYAYA
[2:36:35] HarryBlopper: often when i emulate high elo players it oftens eliminate my own mistakes which is nice peepoHappy
[2:36:39] kingfinesseya: any chance you can try to play a Viego game so I can copy and paste what you do 😆
[2:37:13] 444Kanin: I just cant win games lately... My team just does not want to play with jungle... Its so fkd...
[2:37:26] HarryBlopper: that brand is awful wat
[2:38:43] fightb4udie: samira can't w ur r?
[2:39:01] Jaaammer: @fightb4udie its not a projectile
[2:39:03] Jaaammer: so no
[2:39:55] paaaanda1: @Santorin what's your best off role?
[2:40:04] HarryBlopper: yeah thats gg
[2:40:45] kalopsia512: car radio slappin rn
[2:41:11] solidussovis: Samira W is just for projectiles correct? like wind wall for Yas
[2:41:19] scorpionmkultra: wow ppl still play Corki?
[2:41:27] paaaanda1: corki broken rn
[2:41:55] scorpionmkultra: @paaaanda1 because of an item im guessing lol
[2:42:15] Zeiik101: sort of
[2:42:43] Jaaammer: uhh, olaf seems really good against ur comp
[2:42:50] HarryBlopper: poor bard getting bullied LUL
[2:42:52] Zeiik101: malignance is strong on him right now but overall he's pretty good even without it
[2:42:53] scorpionmkultra: NICE!
[2:42:56] tala____: I NEVER DOUBTED HIM
[2:43:08] solidussovis: Shen might be losing but he is helping this team win with timely ults
[2:43:28] jonasthr1: could press the attack not be better on vi, i feel like conq never does that much
[2:44:53] opticdyno: League of Legends? I thought you were a PalWorld streamer
[2:44:53] Silfel: Longer fights = conq danNodders
[2:45:10] scorpionmkultra: wait what how long has Rift Herald been in the game?
[2:45:30] Silfel: He has a Pal in jungle. It qualifies
[2:45:34] nwa4lifeTV: you mean u stop auto attack after e?
[2:46:05] opticdyno: professional wave management
[2:46:06] Apex_LeVraiJoe: spam click
[2:46:08] Apex_LeVraiJoe: where you want to go
[2:46:14] Khadezz: u click
[2:46:21] nwa4lifeTV: it goes on where the arrow is
[2:46:29] Report_Baron: where u click after you get on it
[2:46:32] Diamonddusts: Is it based on the direction the rift is facing?
[2:46:36] Lokrakil: u need to click initially
[2:46:40] Apex_LeVraiJoe: @Diamonddusts no you can decide by clickinbg
[2:46:44] fightb4udie: u can just not click it and it is similar like old herald
[2:46:44] Diamonddusts: Ah
[2:46:48] nwa4lifeTV: when u click it first, like hextech portal
[2:46:50] Apex_LeVraiJoe: no you can click 100%
[2:46:54] cowiiiie: Right clicking any direction while channeling onto Herald will allow the player to pick where Herald will start charging. While charging, players can steer the Rift Herald while she charges forward (similar to a Sion ultimate).9 Jan 2024
[2:46:54] Zeiik101: The very first big skillshot looking line
[2:46:54] Khadezz: ur put ur mouser cursor
[2:46:59] solidussovis: as soon as you click and get in click the direction you want to go
[2:47:06] solidussovis: you can 180 the herald
[2:47:06] cowiiiie: riot patch notes source ^
[2:47:36] tryurluckpoe: @Santorin  u get a little indicator like vis q when entering
[2:48:04] Zeiik101: The big arrow that looks like Vi's Q 'skillshot' line that appears when you get in the herald. That's the thing that you use to choose the direction
[2:48:53] paaaanda1: they're scaling KEKW
[2:49:07] Khadezz: mental warriors or a cringe dude not surrendering
[2:49:14] getsometalentloser: @santorin  use the new vi skin next time with pearl chroma
[2:49:33] jonasthr1: botlane just keeping them hostage
[2:50:13] gymleaderjusten: buy the bard a skin they deserve it!!
[2:50:47] jonasthr1: i feel like its always the people inting the most that wont ff
[2:51:56] Khadezz: that shen got good luck free win
[2:52:04] nwa4lifeTV: man is all about the base skin Kappa
[2:52:07] scorpionmkultra: Is now a good time to get back into LoL? i've been inactive since before they added Rift Herald. @Santorin
[2:52:33] Monkeydluffy44: @ScorpionXz u always come back to league no matter what
[2:52:55] solidussovis: @ScorpionXz you got out? Run don't go back
[2:53:05] Monkeydluffy44: +1
[2:53:17] Monkeydluffy44: i escaped for 2years and im here again
[2:53:27] scorpionmkultra: getting mixed signals here kintLUL
[2:53:56] Monkeydluffy44: dont come back frfr
[2:54:05] Monkeydluffy44: your life is better without league haha
[2:54:08] scorpionmkultra: lol that bad eh?
[2:54:22] Monkeydluffy44: just a toxic game
[2:54:54] solidussovis: I pretty much only Aaram and play with friends. No more toxic behavior
[2:55:25] Monkeydluffy44: when is vanguard coming?
[2:55:37] HalcyonDays: have you tried jungle rumble since the nerfs ?
[2:55:38] scorpionmkultra: kintLUL kintTap
[2:55:44] alanalda: mute all chat is a must this early season
[2:56:09] solidussovis: I think its better then it has been for a few years but its still the same core game and community
[2:56:19] solidussovis: the game state is really good though
[2:56:28] Monkeydluffy44: there are much more account buying people around emerald
[2:56:28] scorpionmkultra: even outside of ranked they're still toxic? oof
[2:56:36] Monkeydluffy44: thats the only frustrating thing tbh
[2:56:46] scorpionmkultra: ah
[2:57:34] solidussovis: Ok I am going to develop a new game called league of panini's. It will be the same as LoL but all champs will be sandwich based so there is more comedy the toxicity
[2:57:38] scorpionmkultra: oh well, wasn't really invested in ranked anyways. just played the game for fun mostly
[2:59:14] alanalda: as a support player should i be moving for first voidgrubs?
[3:00:39] alanalda: gotcha, I think the hardest thing to judge is 3v3 topside who is stronger
[3:01:22] HalcyonDays: mute adc and venture out into the world FeelsGoodMan
[3:01:42] jzipfel20: not baus
[3:01:47] solidussovis: No ap damage
[3:02:02] foxy_grandpa9: i forgot to tell you about my fantasy lcs team lol. last week i scored the lowest points of everyone. and this week i scored the most that anyone has so far lol my team is so polarizing
[3:02:40] alanalda: its so cool :)
[3:02:53] solidussovis: get lucky dodge is what you do there
[3:02:56] solidussovis: nice moves Santo
[3:03:09] scorpionmkultra: when me and my peeps played together we'd play ARAM, and all of us purposely made smurf accounts, and only purchased yordles. if we didn't get a yordle at first we would roll and reroll until we got a yordle champ kaceyHEH
[3:03:24] foxy_grandpa9: I have DIG Rich, SR Bugi, NRG Palafox, NRG FBI, and IMT Olleh
[3:03:41] solidussovis: @ScorpionXz That sounds amazingly fun
[3:03:45] HalcyonDays: wait thats a great way to force dodges, pick your mechanical champ then say your a support main if you dont like the comp Kappa
[3:03:49] foxy_grandpa9: fbi popped tf off
[3:04:06] foxy_grandpa9: he got like 85 points total
[3:04:30] foxy_grandpa9: olleh went 1-1 but he still had 54 points total.
[3:04:31] SirAntwan: Have you tried your insane Trundle yet this season?
[3:04:33] HalcyonDays: c9s game on sunday was sure something
[3:04:45] scorpionmkultra: @solidussovis it was a blast, we loved it kaceyFist kaceyHEH  also it's still hilarious to me lmao
[3:04:52] alanalda: BOOO

[3:06:53] Diamonddusts: lol
[3:06:56] wygFishkiller: no dodging x)
[3:06:59] alanalda: -22 lp delivery
[3:07:02] SirAntwan: no enchanter next to him yeah he’ll do so much dmg
[3:07:03] DrewGamer: oh no this one looks doomed lol
[3:07:13] alanalda: at the same time, they are bad. ez win
[3:07:16] HalcyonDays: azir can push them into your smokescreen then your out of cc Kappa
[3:07:27] foxy_grandpa9: the only challenger amongst telletubbies
[3:08:07] foxy_grandpa9: do you prefer NA or EU soloq?
[3:08:12] SirAntwan: bruiser graves game or is it too troll? Sundered Sky maybe?
[3:08:20] AmunKaidon: the prob is that now that you noticed it its cursed lol
[3:08:55] scorpionmkultra: Maokai's IGN kaceyGasm
[3:09:01] HalcyonDays: but NA has soloq gods like yung fappy
[3:09:05] HalcyonDays: Kappa
[3:09:08] alanalda: REMINDER VALENTINES DAY IS COMING UP GET YOUR GIFTS NOW
[3:09:35] scorpionmkultra: lmao
[3:09:36] foxy_grandpa9: @alanalda i asked for santorini to deliver me a panini but we'll see
[3:09:56] merck225: mafia graves
[3:10:14] nwa4lifeTV: mafia graves
[3:10:19] solidussovis: IT WILL ALWAYS BE GANGSTER GRAVES. I refuse to call it crime city just because RIOT changed it
[3:10:26] Ashura__Oni: hahahahahaha
[3:10:29] Ashura__Oni: lol
[3:10:44] Silfel: danAware mistakes were made
[3:10:48] scorpionmkultra: kintLUL
[3:10:49] jzipfel20: get that back ready to carry!
[3:11:00] SirAntwan: lol I agree you gotta go all dmg carry piss low top
[3:11:04] AmunKaidon: i just dont understand why people troll like that in ranked
[3:12:12] Dixydu: and start blaming jungle for not ganking 420 times before the first clear
[3:12:12] nwa4lifeTV: team didnt carry Kappa
[3:12:13] solidussovis: but its the jungles fault that he goes 0-10 right?
[3:12:32] HalcyonDays: is the " promised land" Victory or ff 15 Kappa
[3:13:50] solidussovis: as Lucian plays super aggressive though he knows Bel was bot
[3:14:41] Dixydu: lets go lucian
[3:14:43] getsometalentloser: isn’t maokai support bonkers rn
[3:15:00] solidussovis: I take it all back about lucian if he keeps playing like that
[3:15:17] nwa4lifeTV: hes a ghost
[3:15:23] DJ_Photik: Hi spooky chat and @santorin
[3:15:39] solidussovis: ie Shen last game
[3:16:09] solidussovis: How old is your mouse? over 3 weeks? you need a new one.
[3:16:32] solidussovis: I remember you talking about you wearing out your mouse quickly

[5:18:52] LathyrusTv: when he gets 3 items he pops off
[5:19:13] solidussovis: OK Santo is a handsome man, but why does this whole enemy team have such a hard on for him
[5:19:17] eric440: i believe
[5:20:09] Silfel: @solidussovis danKEK2
[5:20:10] solidussovis: the enemy team just really wants a piece of the Panini i guess

[5:30:32] solidussovis: bets if Lucian did over 10k damage?
[5:30:57] TLGeoff: Cool PokCroagunk
[5:31:00] Silfel: Surprised Milio only died twice. Props to that
[5:31:15] Jakmo: That's why it always amazes me when the hard inter says they outperformed because they have the most champ damage
[5:31:23] Jakmo: very braindead way to think about carrying
[5:31:28] DocPhosis: in high kill game is low death good?
[5:31:41] Jakmo: No, it's the ratio Doc
[5:32:05] TLGeoff: PepeLaugh
[5:32:09] TLGeoff: get trolled\
[5:32:36] solidussovis: power spike at 10 deaths right
[5:32:38] DocPhosis: I just mean, if the person has low death, are they relevant in the game
[5:33:04] 1upduds: lol I was watching the game and you said something about forgiving lucian because of his level 2 help and now this hahahahhahha don't mean to hate <3 just thought it was genuinely funny
[5:33:25] 1upduds: LUL
[5:33:32] solidussovis: Agreed but Lucian did so much to deserve that report

[5:33:35] macywaky: yo @Santorin u watch LEC rn?
[5:33:37] Silfel: danKEK2
[5:33:39] Jakmo: @DocPhosis it always depends. if it's a 100 kill game and they have 24 kills and 2 deaths, are you going to say they're absent or doing well?
[5:33:39] 1upduds: yeah yeah I feel you hahahahahah

[5:35:39] macywaky: azir
[5:35:39] Jakmo: @DocPhosis You're clearly stupid so I'll stop responding. Literally said it "always depends" and gave an example for thought and you're being rude. good person
