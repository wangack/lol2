[0:49:51] Hattnissen: Oh stop it you kaypLurk
[0:49:52] sleepypotato_123: gotta filter out the haters
[0:50:04] Waywardx: In most games getting good yields instant payoff, but in League good mental is what works. So you can't strain yourself to improve in League, or you get frustrated
[0:50:05] jeroenvijver: league can do good things aswell
[0:50:14] ani671: You were really adamant about having a positive community, and your positive energy attracted a positive community to stay around.

[0:51:21] Teekwan: @gigachadgodsu gladly, roll for initiative LUL
[0:51:24] Waywardx: If you get 10% better, which is actually a lot, there's 9 other people in the game.. So the actual difference you can make is more like 1%
[0:51:27] jeroenvijver: didnt they kiinda fix lp gain? atleast i feel like i gain more (but also loose a little more, just not as bad)
[0:51:38] heeyysteve: I did not know that. Holy smokes
[0:52:04] Hattnissen: Yeah it's just winstreak -> losestreak -> winstreak -> losestreak
[0:52:09] LenaRiddle_: DinoDance
[0:52:11] PrimeTimeX24: 2 straight wins then you get a bad game thats how it normally goes for me
[0:52:27] wilbert_1995: Yes Jillipuff twitch account banned bye bye 😭💔💔💔💔
[0:52:32] Teekwan: But nobody would get addicted If they only kept winning

[0:52:37] QTwinkyyy: Would  you say Ahri feels like a strong midlaner or is she on the weaker side?
[0:52:39] Phantomspower: i have like 77% winrate on my plat account, and the amount of boosted people i get on my games that i have to carry is unbelieve-able, its like riot wants me to lose KEKW

[0:54:06] ancholy: Hey friends :D
[0:54:16] jeroenvijver: they just need to make lp gain like they have in valorant- based on performance is how much u gain/loose
[0:54:24] jeroenvijver: they can do it in val, why not in league?
[0:54:41] jungl4r: yea like valo
[0:54:47] heeyysteve: ohhhh yeah
[0:55:05] goliat_gamee: that would be awesome cuz this would acually push ppl that deserve
[0:55:06] Angeliclights: yeah but people will only play for kda right?
[0:55:13] jungl4r: its not about the win its about ur performance in the game
[0:55:14] lordkazama76: Hii my big sister I miss you
[0:55:17] jeroenvijver: cuz they have stats u can look at after a game. so idk why they didnt do that yet
[0:55:19] Johntrueman23: hello @KayPea
[0:55:45] heeyysteve: getting reported successfully should tank your progress too (unless this already a thing?)
[0:55:50] RowdyRoran: what if you're doing like a non-meta strat like being a supp that roams like a bard would and that leads to a win but gets you a D on the champ
[0:55:51] mighty_banana: but that might make people ignore teamplay and focus on kda perhaps?
[0:55:52] Setrio80: Agreed. individual grades should definitely influence LP gains/losses more!
[0:56:07] ElderFrost420: Ummmmm why am I getting an ad right now?
[0:56:08] lordkazama76: I'm good 😊
[0:56:09] jeroenvijver: it makes it more impressive to be a higher rank lmao
[0:56:33] violet_sl: hi kaypea how are u ? 💜

[1:00:06] xBoomShotBaby: @Darkcyter kaypHello kaypHello
[1:00:06] goliat_gamee: the think that in lol there is only win or lose nothing else that sucks and is more rewarding for ppl that dont deserver their ranks
[1:00:09] ancholy: @darkcyter Thankyouu
[1:00:10] dylanship: Morning basement. Are we back winning streak ? :D
[1:00:25] Darkcyter: @Caroliineeee @dylanship kaypHello kaypHello
[1:00:28] rebelaspect: my idea was that you still gain lp for the win but you gain less lp if you did horribly, more if you did well, and I think if you lose and do great you should stay the same maybe lose a little, and if you lose and do horribly you should lose lp
[1:00:33] Sunnytinker: oh yeah this song is decent
[1:00:49] rebelaspect: because for me, as a silver player it’s hard as fuck to climb out especially with the roles I play

[1:06:52] AptApeArt: in the experiments they've done with individual performance affecting rank they find it encourages even worse, more anti-social behavior between teammates. kill stealing, lack of cooperation, etc. but even worse
[1:06:53] Sunnytinker: omg this song was on my discover weekly too lol
[1:07:38] Darkcyter: @Limpix_ 93 kaypHYPERS WB

[1:12:32] QTwinkyyy: I feel bad for the Jayce because of the tenting top but he should also not be typing at all!
[1:13:18] mrry2k: i feel like jayce isnt a viable pick at all in lower elo just like nidalee theyre just too hard to be useful on
[1:14:15] let_james_play: I dont understand when people die alot they dont then play safe. if your behind, its unlikely playing the same way is gonna magicly make you win.
[1:14:43] Niomah: I got an S+ on Jayce in ARAM and I don't play him much. You have to know when to switch from ranged to melee on him.
[1:15:11] Darkcyter: Heard that they announced Brand as a "Broken" tier jungler

[1:22:18] QTwinkyyy: I like how Brand didn't even use any other abilities, only ult!
[1:22:28] Slirre1: I like that things are more deadly. Attacking damage sponges is just really boring. They just need to fix a few things.
[1:23:47] arcadedani: poor Ezreal

[1:52:51] littlejellyfishy: Omg it's the Beach Braum kaypInLove kaypInLove
[1:52:53] Viivica: I hate that pinging skills says "wait for". Like, sometimes it comes across as "back off" though I just mean "go go go but fyi I don't have it"
[1:53:25] jimbob_ywert: Hey chat! and KAYPEA! what’s the scores so far?
[1:53:37] littlejellyfishy: @jimbob_ywert Hi Jimbob ! 1-1
[1:53:56] Viivica: That seems like a change someone who never played League made...
[1:53:56] jimbob_ywert: @littlejellyfishy hello, thanks! games looking good so far :)
[1:53:56] StarShadowsLight: Go teaaaam wooo!! <3
[1:54:15] StarShadowsLight: Hi kay! <3
[1:54:20] QTwinkyyy: I know we talk about it a lot but MR feels so disgustingly strong.  Your Q's barely tickled the K'sante
[1:54:24] RowdyRoran: it should say (Cooldown on *ability*)
[1:55:01] Martybggg: the kaenic rookern item is so strong vs mages
[1:55:02] jimbob_ywert: voidstaff time…
[1:56:03] jtschecki: didiocy ellabaLove
[1:56:11] jimbob_ywert: That ult was good
[1:56:20] Viivica: I really hate the abilities that remove vision the most (Noc ult, Graves and Quinn bs)
[1:56:28] Viivica: MAKES ME FEEL DUMB
[1:56:35] StarShadowsLight: You did so good though! <3
[1:56:38] Viivica: And lost and lonely
[1:56:45] lausteen: it was legit like 300 dmg

[1:57:12] StarShadowsLight: Thank you for always offering to help me btw <3 FallCry
[1:57:13] Dumbmuto: @Darkcyter plink
[1:57:19] Jaketin8: Im saddened that they fixed the spirit visage counting up constantly from the kaenic, its not like it was affectin anything other than how much "value" the item has giving, which pretty much doesnt affect anything anyways, it was funny to see like 200k extra shielding after few mins, was funny af
[1:57:25] lausteen: time to learn qiyana ? @KayPea
[1:57:30] Victor_belver: Its like ur qs make more damages xdd
[1:57:34] Sunnytinker: its for wave clearing Kappa
[1:57:34] bluesiies: imagine if armor was half as good

[1:57:47] Jaguar542: Zigg's ult is just pretty fireworks!
[1:57:52] Viivica: @Jaketin8 It was rly funny
[1:57:55] vergilium: kaypRonin
[1:58:08] TomNova: Its just a blue ward LUL

[1:59:40] Jaketin8: Yeah, spirit just counted up constantly if you had kaenic, it was funny to see it go up constantly while out of combat, within like 5mins in aram i got like 200k extra shielding "value", was fun to see that high number, despite not actually having gotten that much, it was just harmless funny interaction
[2:00:02] Jaguar542: ?? RIP
[2:00:02] Tarezi1: unfortunate
[2:00:09] CynicalScrub: we didn't see anything

[2:00:52] Gar116: Or something
[2:00:52] Viivica: All KP
[2:00:53] Niomah: I think you need void and malignance to combat the MR
[2:01:02] aty212121: Rabbadon?
[2:01:05] CynicalScrub: no no no, you had to distract them for 10 seconds to give your team time to get there
[2:01:06] iBexi: It was a hey that was worth it, death. All good. courtillyWiggle
[2:01:08] CynicalScrub: it was all calculated
[2:01:10] Flinkehh: They wanted to ff like 30 seconds ago too like have some confidence breh

[2:03:18] lewhitehd69: @Darkcyter ratirlSalute
[2:04:23] redtauro: will URF be available on Feb 7th? FeelsBadMan
[2:04:27] Jaketin8: @jimbob_ywert Cuz clearly riot balance team is hardstuck, tank/bruiser mains, so they consantly break them to climb, like there is no way tank and bruisers have been this overly strong and they have done nothing, unless its because they just want tank and bruiser to control the game totally
[2:04:36] Viivica: No ward in bush = no way they are there :)
[2:05:22] Viivica: Anyone on team have the anti shield item? Would be useful
[2:05:28] redtauro: Heal cut should also half existing shields PunOko
[2:06:10] Jaketin8: @Viivica Well, sadly that item honestly so shit if you dont have someone building lethality build, its such bs that shield reduction is only for lethality
[2:06:11] meep_: Why does it feel like they made 5 new magic resist items for tanks this season kaypAnnoyed kaypUpsetti
[2:06:16] devinefury2867: yeah, i hate that item on ksante..  stupid new item.  makes all mages usless just with that 1 item.
[2:06:27] Viivica: @Jaketin8 Yeah true
[2:06:32] Razmeck: The Ksante still had His AP shield to his death
[2:06:41] redtauro: so what's the verdict regarding the Mages becoming OP after the new items?
[2:07:29] CynicalScrub: this is strange.  i dunno the last time i saw a close game on league
[2:07:51] CynicalScrub: the people who think mages are the problem are adc mains
[2:07:52] Jaketin8: Some mages are honestly insane, but tanks and bruisers are still 10000 times worse and riot balance team needs to be fired for not nerfing them yet
[2:08:00] ooOOverDoseOoo: !followage
[2:08:00] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[2:08:15] WolfieKronos: mages are not OP. lol assassins build Maw and and still one shot with 2 and a half items lol. tanks are still doing insane amounts of damage while building endless MR . like its insane.
[2:08:19] Tritros: mages are the problem if I don’t build any mr kaypLUL
[2:08:20] Niomah: The only thing mages are strong vs atm are other mages and maybe unfed ADCs
[2:08:39] csxngxx: @Jaketin8 idk about that one... seraphine being higher wr on mid lane is kind of telling us something about the state of mages:)
[2:08:40] Viivica: @Tritros Such a high iq moves most league players would never
[2:08:44] CynicalScrub: gg
[2:08:45] Razmeck: its more like Mage Burst/Asassains became Op with the items and control mages are hurts
[2:08:47] Smoothcollie: Hey guys kaypHello
[2:08:49] WolfieKronos: the MR item being merc treads and we are finished
[2:08:59] mistermurr: Gg's
[2:09:00] jimbob_ywert: the whole point of mages is to burst, their let down is being squishy. THATS THE WHOLE POINT. if they do no damage AND are squishy, they’re just useless. mages are balanced.
[2:09:02] aty212121: Wp
[2:09:07] Darkcyter: Ziggs's turret destruction capability is unparalleled
[2:09:19] CynicalScrub: @KayPea doubters won the prediction this time, but you still won the game :)
[2:09:24] Afcb89: Good evening From England land
[2:09:26] Smoothcollie: Are we shitin over something again kaypSip over wha? I wanna shit as well
[2:09:27] xShadow1: @Jaketin8 bruisers have always been too strong and thats not gonna ever change
[2:09:44] thelmattador: Doubters win?
[2:09:47] AllyCaatt: well love report feedback
[2:09:55] sovitiaisavampire: bombs = fried chicken
[2:09:56] mistermurr: I think so too
[2:09:58] ericaborgest: Victory kaypHYPERS
[2:10:05] jimbob_ywert: the thing is, mages are supposed to do burst damage and their let down is being squishy. if they don’t do any damage and are squishy, they’re literally useless. that’s why they’re balanced rn. they do good damage (although not always) and are squishy. they’re balanced
[2:10:08] Viivica: Report feedback = the real league highlights
[2:10:09] WolfieKronos: I logged into league yesterday and I got 18 report feedbacks lmfao
[2:10:26] Viivica: @WolfieKronos That's hot
[2:10:38] doublemeatpalace: I think there are a couple op mages atm but a lot of mages are that strong.
[2:10:40] WolfieKronos: I reported a lot of ppl
[2:10:52] WolfieKronos: I had to
[2:10:55] Niomah: @jimbob_ywert that only flies if a tank building all damage and 1 tank item are still unkillable while one shotting non tanks
[2:11:00] Jaketin8: @xShadow1 Sadly, yes. Which is why league is honestly becoming shitshow and so boring, because every game is the same, the team with better bruiser player pretty much just wins it because of it
[2:11:05] Niomah: if they aren't rather
[2:11:10] khadapys: hi KayPea <3 hi Chat <3 have a nice day :D
[2:11:17] bridgeb4poker: where in EU are u?
[2:11:20] Razmeck: Are you able to know who honors you?
[2:11:23] jimbob_ywert: bro gained HP by getting hit 💀
[2:11:24] WolfieKronos: NO it's stupid we have 4 MP items. while theres like 12 MR items for assassins alone + the tank items like runek, force of nature, visage, etc.
[2:11:27] HalfBakedPotat0: @WolfieKronos anyone coming in champ selectwith a "hi team" wolfie be like "aight imma take you out" LUL
[2:11:30] CynicalScrub: !eu
[2:11:30] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[2:11:40] Niomah: Full damge Malphite still one shots a mage while taking no damage
[2:11:50] WolfieKronos: @HalfBakedPotat0 LMFAO no just a bunch of inters or ppl being toxic for zero reason
[2:12:02] Galetea: Yeah whenever i see a ksante i just hope my bruisers or assassins/adc get him bc i cant touch him lol
[2:12:16] khadapys: i'm late bc of work :( but it's my time for relax with your stream :D
[2:12:34] mistermurr: Have you seen any improvement in the mmr lately KP?
[2:12:38] HalfBakedPotat0: @WolfieKronos dw i got you its the nature of this community ig
[2:12:50] jimbob_ywert: do you enjoy playing other classes other than mages?
[2:13:10] watson1235: yes chopea kaypUpsetti
[2:13:21] watson1235: kaypHappea
[2:13:36] jimbob_ywert: this song brings memories kaypUpsetti
[2:13:38] WolfieKronos: either fix the MP ratios on the four items we already have OR just delete four or five MR items.
[2:13:47] devinefury2867: i love mages too, currently addicdted to Syndra

[2:44:33] Niomah: I am SO glad I don't teach anymore. The AI stuff would make me rage
[2:44:38] Karimftw: bro people are getting degrees thanks to it it's hilarious
[2:44:40] Viusthas: i mean, why would you not use the tools at your disposal
[2:44:40] IoSonoBatman: I got a date with chat gpt KappaHD
[2:44:46] jimbob_ywert: the way AI is going to be the start of the school system fall is scary but interesting
[2:44:55] Cut_n_Run: teachers are using hidden words in questions so copy and paste the question into chatGPT so it makes random crap answeres
[2:45:00] AzogDaAussie: back in my day, we had sticks and a stone, and we had to share the stone!
[2:45:06] Cut_n_Run: * answers*
[2:45:16] watson1235: I would have abused the hell out of if it had been around in school. I was undiagnosed add and it was a suffer lol
[2:45:31] markella_andri: the games are better today?
[2:45:35] ThePeePuddle: AI V-tubers incoming
[2:45:37] sovitiaisavampire: kaypAnnoyed how can AI kaypAnnoyed
[2:45:39] mighty_banana: there is a pretty popular ai vtuber...
[2:45:43] jimbob_ywert: streamers are already using AI avatars 😭
[2:45:43] Wolfematics: Wolfematics subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! 40 months! Wow, who knew being trapped in the basement for this long would be so nice. Cheers to all your future wins. Dubs for the rest of the day!
[2:45:50] kattoad: There's already an ai vtuber that's pretty popular
[2:45:53] J_to_the_jf: to be fair 4 of the top colleges in the world have leaders that all plagiarized LUL
[2:46:03] Niomah: Mind you, forcing students to write papers on things they can just look up on their phone is a bit dumb these days. I'd rather they teach business writing and creative writing.
[2:46:04] Cut_n_Run: AI with a vtuber avatar, people will start to not notice
[2:46:05] Hattnissen: People are in love with AI girlfriends though kaypTroll
[2:46:05] lewhitehd69: so you're telling me you're not AI? Susge
[2:46:09] NoPainNoDane: Clip that quote so AI in 20 years time can laugh
[2:46:13] call_me_teaa: Screw AI tbh. there needs to be tight rules around it
[2:46:21] IoSonoBatman: Well there are V-tube streaming, we got a match againist a bot inferno on lol (wich played perfectly) i dont think require so much time before someone build something automatic
[2:46:21] Lunaremis: Hello there
[2:46:24] sovitiaisavampire: AI girlfriends >real thing
[2:46:27] Niomah: I loathe AI as an artist and photographer mind you
[2:46:29] Viusthas: AI kinda creeps me out, we're fine until they discover how to create other AIs
[2:46:38] Galetea: I remember when teachers told me not to use Wikipedia when writing my essays now they have to scan them for plagiarism  vicksyDerp
[2:46:42] steelxdawn: If people become desperate enough for that.....THE WORLD DESERVES TO END. BLADE RUNNER 2049 predicted the future and its gonna be tragic lol
[2:46:50] sabiirox: ai gonna take over the world kaypAnnoyed
[2:46:51] Smoothcollie: Honestly I used chatGPT to summarise an article about imunology privilegium. Cuz it's shit, I didn't understand a shit in my native Lang, no speaking about in eng kaypUpsetti And to my defend, i passed my exam with an A today
[2:46:51] meep_: Man, AI was supposed to be used to make life easier, not get rid of the arts kaypRiot
[2:46:51] Niomah: also THIS IS HOW WE GET SKYNET PEOPLE
[2:46:53] jimbob_ywert: AI is useful when used right. but as Heimerdinger says “a tool as powerful as that can be deadly in the wrong hands”!
[2:47:12] sovitiaisavampire: blade runner? i WILL get my ana de armas AI gf? thank god
[2:47:23] lewhitehd69: @sovitiaisavampire hell ye ratirlBusiness
[2:47:29] IoSonoBatman: Chat gpt can already solve a CAPTCHA KappaHD
[2:47:33] Niomah: though we're more likely to end up like the people in WALL-E than Blade Runner or Terminator
[2:47:43] call_me_teaa: @jimbob_ywert AI being this accessible to the common folk is very dangerous,  it's mostly used for the most degenerate things
[2:47:44] Viusthas: AIs are going to destroy so many lives once they're perfected
[2:47:45] lewhitehd69: maybe i am AI MrDestructoid
[2:47:46] MthaFkin_Oops: We are already in a huge world change with AI, we just need to adapt to it becaus it is, and will be more involved, in almost everything we do daily.  it is where its going.
[2:47:54] J_to_the_jf: wanna run the best college in the world? ChatGPT dude Kappa
[2:48:06] Hattnissen: How do we know you aren't AI?? I have never met you kaypAnnoyed
[2:48:14] torge_154: kaypLove
[2:48:24] Darkcyter: I think I'd love to interact with an advanced ai streamer just to see how advanced it can be with conversations
[2:48:24] Karimftw: at that point you don't even need a person to click live
[2:48:30] Karimftw: that can be automated :^)
[2:48:31] RowdyRoran: we already have automated voice message waiting rooms
[2:48:31] shamneo: 4 hours? im expecting a 24 hour stream from ai streamers Kappa
[2:48:34] Viusthas: I really hope it's never a thing tbh
[2:48:35] lewhitehd69: PeepoSHAKE
[2:48:41] ericaborgest: I can't tell anymore kaypWHAT
[2:48:42] ThePeePuddle: I am not even normal "I" Kappa
[2:48:44] steelxdawn: You look way too young for your age Kay.....im starting to think youre AI
[2:48:45] Darkcyter: we're living in a matrix anyway MrDestructoid
[2:48:49] jimbob_ywert: someone’s already developing a league AI (saw on twitter) that can interact and detect enemy MIA and objectives. it’s like a perfect macro AI
[2:48:52] Sunnytinker: i feel like that would be very unentertaining
[2:48:52] shamneo: she misses cannons.. definitely person. Kappa
[2:48:54] Dumbmuto: PeepoSHAKE
[2:48:55] torge_154: PeepoSHAKE
[2:49:00] Darkcyter: @ThePeePuddle kaypHello
[2:49:03] weecore: that's a weird compliment
[2:49:09] IoSonoBatman: I think you're a V-tube, you should Say "Jungle diff" to convince that you are real KappaHD
[2:49:11] ThePeePuddle: @Darkcyter kaypLove
[2:49:14] mistermurr: kaypAwkward
[2:49:14] Smoothcollie: Well befor this happens some insane will nuke us out of this planet. So. No need to worry guys, that's kinda depressing theme, ngl
[2:49:15] Hattnissen: @steelxdawn Haven't aged in 10 years, you are on to something
[2:49:19] MthaFkin_Oops: its already being discussed high up in the governments, putting rules and regulations on it.  hope it doesnt get out of control like the internet did when it because a thing.
[2:49:31] mentalfordaayz: hi-a Kels how's it goooin? that music is so peaceful i hated it already kaypCreep kaypCreep
[2:49:34] MthaFkin_Oops: became a thing*
[2:49:40] sabiirox: have there been alot of scripters lately?
[2:49:44] Cut_n_Run: jokes on all of you, you are actually watching Lucas play and this is an AI talking
[2:49:49] arson63: people are actually making ais using brain cells and they can play doom
[2:49:54] Tritros: this kp patch talks about ai too much should role back the patch
[2:49:57] arson63: from what i heard at least
[2:50:04] mistermurr: We would know that you're AI if you start the stream on time Kappa
[2:50:05] lewhitehd69: @KayPea love that all government people are like 75 year old boomers who can barely use the calculator app to take these decisions
[2:50:17] jimbob_ywert: Yuhu lux game
[2:50:17] Viusthas: AIs playing Doom?? We're doomed frfr
[2:50:32] Galetea: They're only now putting regulations on AI bc people that are celebrities are being impacted negatively. SAG AFTRA didnt wanna do anything about AI when it came to voice actors until recently
[2:50:34] Cut_n_Run: wow the AI talking back to its creators already... skynet is coming!
[2:50:35] MthaFkin_Oops: @lewhitehd69 lmao
[2:50:38] Darkcyter: tbh at this point you looking young is more like an observation than a compliment Monkas vampirism is real ya'll
[2:50:40] arson63: @Viusthas kaypLUL
[2:50:48] icechukker: I’m about to give up on this game haha this season been roughhhhhh
[2:51:00] jimbob_ywert: Why are people who are in trillions of debt deciding what runs in our country…? getting too political here
[2:51:05] J_to_the_jf: not just celebrities The top colleges of the world have people leading them that all used chatGPT to get into power
[2:51:11] aty212121: Can you play zyra??
[2:51:34] IoSonoBatman: I dont like a future like "Terminator", im more a "Resident Evil" guy
[2:51:34] AptApeArt: there were barely any professional artists anyway. the AI will just make it easier to be far more productive and not spend 12 hours on a $20 commission
[2:51:45] kumiho66: kaypSubHype
[2:51:48] jimbob_ywert: didn’t riot get caught using AI to make a cinematic?
[2:51:58] J_to_the_jf: I mean it's true tho
[2:51:58] MthaFkin_Oops: @KayPea exactly
[2:52:04] jimbob_ywert: Only future job: Making AI
[2:52:04] AptApeArt: unfortunately those not tech savvy will probably not be able to compete, but it was barely a viable career anyway
[2:52:09] Viusthas: @AptApeArt people are going to get some AI art tattoos with 6 fingers on themselves, can't wait
[2:52:21] TomNova: At least AI can't draw fingers yet
[2:52:32] Niomah: Marvel used AI for the intro credits for Secret Wars and got flamed hard for it
[2:52:34] AllyCaatt: it was sivir!
[2:52:37] J_to_the_jf: bro why NOT use AI?
[2:52:49] SickeningTouchLoL: Haro @kaypea how are you doing?
[2:52:54] AptApeArt: unless you're going for photorealism it still has to be programmed to design in a specific style
[2:52:55] Galetea: @AptApeArt Thats extremely untrue. There are still thousands of pro artists in every industry. AI is fed on millions of art from people all over. Sure its more productive but its a disgusting less emotional amalgamation of art
[2:52:59] weecore: AI is what gets the headlines, but it's ultimately the issue that pensions and investments HAVE to grow.   When things have to grow endlessly, and the economy isn't growing (and interest rates get higher), then you have to ensure you're in the green on other spreadsheets.
[2:53:04] AllyCaatt: i remember that, it was funny af
[2:53:11] weecore: Like, esports jobs aren't being replaced by AI and they're still gettin cuts.
[2:53:22] jimbob_ywert: @j_to_the_jf It just loses its value on people who are actually talented. AI is helpeful when it’s not replacing everything.
[2:53:23] mistermurr: How was it pronounced?
[2:53:41] AllyCaatt: si-ver
[2:53:43] Viusthas: There's a fine line between AI being a fun tool that's actually useful in everyday life and something that destroys entire careers
[2:53:43] AllyCaatt: yes
[2:53:46] Hattnissen: @mistermurr sivir Kappa
[2:53:48] nassimiheb: for getting a job Sadge
[2:53:50] IoSonoBatman: On Italy our storic dub of Goku was dead so many years ago, someone used the AI with his voice to dub the new episode of Dragonball, was insane that he looks real
[2:53:52] mordefist: You've been born on the same day as Rihanna and you have the same age as her, cool fact about KP
[2:53:52] torge_154: gotta eat now. come back soon kaypLove
[2:53:56] J_to_the_jf: @jimbob_ywert if AI can do it better get better or change jobs? I dunno what to tell you it sucks but it's just true
[2:54:01] mistermurr: kaypLOL
[2:54:10] Galetea: AI should not be used to replace people, it should be used to help make things easier for us, not to take jobs away
[2:54:11] sovitiaisavampire: technology has always replaced jobs
[2:54:12] Tabster1TV: Wait thats not how you say Sivir?
[2:54:17] Niomah: Not happening in this capitalist hellscape
[2:54:23] sovitiaisavampire: im a sales person, im literally unreplaceable
[2:54:47] AzogDaAussie: it'll remove jobs, but it'll also make new ones
[2:54:54] sabiirox: istnt there a resturaunt that has robots as workers or smt idk
[2:55:01] RowdyRoran: @J_to_the_jf the point is if all the desired jobs are done by ai, what will millions of people do
[2:55:02] Galetea: I have a degree for the game industry and im glad i didnt go into it with how many people have been just dumped that I know
[2:55:09] arcadedani: @Viusthas exactly i use AI for some things in my job because is usefull and is a tool but companies wanting to replace people to save money is just disgusting...AI should be a tool to help us improve not to replace us
[2:55:16] jimbob_ywert: @j_to_the_jf Then again it’s not always about how good something is. It has no value or emotion behind it.And AI is AI, if can never be a real human, so it’ll never be perfect and almost always make mistakes.
[2:55:19] TomNova: The other thing is if people heavily depend on AI, we are gonna get worse at not being to do anything ourselves or think
[2:55:21] ThePeePuddle: same thing happened with automatization in factories and such. It will 100% take jobs away but I hope it just remains a tool and not take over jobs fully
[2:55:29] SickeningTouchLoL: no go lux
[2:55:32] doublemeatpalace: Corki xd
[2:55:33] J_to_the_jf: @RowdyRoran there are tons of jobs people can do they just like theirs more than what they can do
[2:55:34] SickeningTouchLoL: what could go wrong
[2:55:34] AptApeArt: thousands of professional artists out of 330 million people constitutes a barely viable career
[2:55:36] HydroMerano: Hey everyone. I hope folks are having a good today so far!
[2:55:36] AllyCaatt: I’ve been having so much fun with viktor
[2:55:55] SickeningTouchLoL: Cho gath mid
[2:56:00] Hattnissen: AI is great to remove mundane tasks for people that could use the time better. But at the same time the person that needs a job even if it's mundane might lose it
[2:56:00] J_to_the_jf: @jimbob_ywert 90% of the world doesn't care if it has emotion to it or not. I don't agree with it but it's how it works
[2:56:01] BlackBeard_Ac3: Looks like you're going against yone, he banned fizz
[2:56:05] Viusthas: Someday AIs will learn how to create other AIs that do the task you asked them to do. It's sadly inevitable and at that point, we're screwed
[2:56:06] MthaFkin_Oops: itll force humans to all get into tech jobs, as we look to populate other planets, nobody is looking at how long itll be until earth is uninhabitable becaus earth is suffering as it is.  itll be a long time before this happens, but its where humanity will be going eventually
[2:56:07] Niomah: The difference with the factory automation was that was a safety thing. Those jobs were generally dangerpus exhausting work.
[2:56:33] sabiirox: isnt vex a good counter against Azir? caus she can fear hes dash?
[2:56:40] Niomah: Writing ad copy for commercials isn't dangerous
[2:57:00] sabiirox: oh no not the dog kaypLunaRage
[2:57:01] AzogDaAussie: @Niomah that may be true, but that wasn't the original benefit of automation
[2:57:16] jimbob_ywert: @j_to_the_jf A lot of people do actually. why do you think riot got bashed when they got caught using AI?? also, it is a problem when it starts to (future) take jobs away AND is used to promote fake lies.
[2:57:23] ghost_doggo7: speaking the truth, babe
[2:57:30] Niomah: @AzogDaAussie It was part of why it became acceptable though, which is where the AI sell fails
[2:57:31] Karimftw: what a time to be alive
[2:57:32] kingdomofblue: have you tried karma mid? she has pretty great potential for outplays and deals a lot of dmg
[2:57:34] aty212121: Not really Azir can pushout vex easily if comes close and he is strong at that!
[2:57:37] Smoothcollie: I'm from Neptune tho kaypAnnoyed
[2:57:38] kronkrodil: where are you from
[2:57:38] Hattnissen: your ass is made of emerald?
[2:57:41] RowdyRoran: @J_to_the_jf That isn't a solution and we will be working with the gov't to make sure that doesn't happen
[2:57:41] J_to_the_jf: @jimbob_ywert they didn't tho. That was the funniest part they didn't and people still got mad.
[2:57:48] Tabster1TV: So long as we put a recaptcha code in our jobs well be fine Kappa
[2:57:50] ballzagna1: she speaks about being emerald the same way i speak of myself being gold. YOUR BETTER THEN THAT
[2:58:00] mistermurr: Like Viktor said: Join the glorious evolution kaypPuppet
[2:58:05] Viusthas: that nautilus is tilted
[2:58:12] Jaguar542: Chat anyone who wants to invest in some EMPs against AI ?
[2:58:30] yildizakaman: hello
[2:58:36] J_to_the_jf: @RowdyRoran it is a solution. Why be mad at AI cause you wanna draw art for a living but can't? I can't be president am I supposed to be mad at the president for making those rules tho?
[2:58:40] Galetea: Is Viktor a good poke vs Azir?
[2:58:49] Galetea: I hate playing vs Azir
[2:58:53] jimbob_ywert: you used it three times already 😭
[2:58:55] Viusthas: Viktor's laser is a depressing spell, the cooldown is SO long
[2:58:58] Haruloo: happy monday <3
[2:59:33] Haruloo: hows it going, how have the games been?
[3:00:03] RowdyRoran: @J_to_the_jf We will be and have already pushed the gov't to make regulations against it
[3:00:11] Smoothcollie: Honestly imagine if it would hasve a lesser CD. U basically cannot dodge it, it would be kinda unfair I think
[3:00:15] lewhitehd69: @KayPea save the minion dmg elixir for cannons kaypCaptainMaple
[3:00:20] sabiirox: do you go tear on Viktor?
[3:00:30] Viusthas: early game laser is kinda underwhelming tho
[3:00:31] J_to_the_jf: @RowdyRoran I mean you can do that all you want won't change the fact that companies are allowed to make decisions for themselves just like you and I are allowed to
[3:00:32] RowdyRoran: also I can draw better than pretty much all ai so not an argument lol
[3:00:47] Galetea: Omg you have puppy on your team. I love her

[3:02:04] RowdyRoran: @J_to_the_jf Nah, I want it to be as hard as possible for people to get cheap artificial art
[3:02:09] Galetea: @J_to_the_jf AI doesnt do it for free. Using that software uses so much fresh clean water to keep the data centers cooled so it DOES cost
[3:02:12] Gar116: So many mana
[3:02:13] kaithegemini: gives more the lower mana you are

[3:02:36] J_to_the_jf: @RowdyRoran so you want everyone else to suffer so you can keep your job? got it. That's kind of selfish no?
[3:02:43] jimbob_ywert: @j_to_the_jf they did. search it up. they did twice, for a video.
[3:03:02] Galetea: @J_to_the_jf You do realize that art is a luxury tho right . . . .
[3:03:02] J_to_the_jf: @Galetea what water? most servers are cooled by freezer rooms
[3:03:04] mistermurr: At what time does George appear?
[3:03:10] RowdyRoran: Only greedy people will suffer. It's objectively the correct moral opinion
[3:03:15] Galetea: @J_to_the_jf they absolutely are not
[3:03:18] Jaguar542: I want a potion to change legend!
[3:03:44] J_to_the_jf: @Galetea where are your facts coming from? I can show my sources
[3:04:03] jimbob_ywert: CASINOO
[3:04:18] SpookyPuff_: hii Kels!
[3:04:19] lewhitehd69: @J_to_the_jf they are air cooled right? i feel like i remember smt like that from one of my courses in uni where we read a paper on it
[3:04:22] J_to_the_jf: @RowdyRoran not really you wanting to be the artists for companies and force them to use you is greedy and also kind of selfish. Just get better people skills and your job will be secured for you?
[3:04:24] watson1235: Biscuit Delivery: Gain a Total Biscuit of Everlasting Will every 3 mins, until 12 min.  Biscuits restore 15% of your missing health and mana.

[3:04:42] Galetea: @J_to_the_jf Forbes and other studies like the University of Cali study done last year.
[3:04:55] J_to_the_jf: @Galetea got a link? or just stating it?
[3:05:08] jimbob_ywert: Prediction KELS kaypAnnoyed kaypAnnoyed kaypAnnoyed
[3:05:20] lewhitehd69: @J_to_the_jf @Galetea also yall can dm this dont need to do it in chat
[3:05:23] makki_b: !EU
[3:05:23] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[3:05:25] mistermurr: How many little raptors are there?
[3:05:28] Galetea: @J_to_the_jf I dont think im allowed to post links in chat. You realize you can just google correct?
[3:05:30] Viusthas: that was A LOT of flashes in 2 seconds LUL

[3:05:50] steelxdawn: you should play more viktor....you were always good with him
[3:05:54] J_to_the_jf: @Galetea I don't need to google. Most super computers are kept in freezers and if they're not that's not on me that's on the company to fix
[3:05:56] Galetea: @lewhitehd69 Im done with them. I dont enjoy seeing them bully someone in the chat so I was trying to help. Ill just block them now
[3:06:03] Jaguar542: What top laner does more dmg?
[3:06:20] jimbob_ywert: can you show the ADCS
[3:06:21] J_to_the_jf: @Galetea it's not bullying the fact that you think it's bullying when it's a convo means you're small headed right now
[3:06:22] Sunnytinker: what is their current cs?
[3:06:37] J_to_the_jf: discussions don't always have to go your way for it to be "bullying"
[3:06:54] J_to_the_jf: and to say it's bullying because it's not going your way is in fact a really fucked up thing
[3:06:57] Smoothcollie: @j_to_the_jf the metaphore with the president isn't the best honestly. U won't be president cuz u cannot, not bcs ai stole your profession. Try to look at things from the other side please. I'm no even an artist but I get why artists get angry. It's like saying that u shouldn't be mad that machine took over your job when machines were invented. Did it make the life better for others? Ye. But for employees? Nop. They are right to be offended and angry
[3:07:05] RowdyRoran: @J_to_the_jf Yeah dude, Idk why you're so for this but I wholeheartedly disagree that it's a selfish. I think it's greedy to want to skimp on paying a true artist
[3:07:20] dieKreTzn: tbh youre stating "facts" but demand links from others -.-
[3:07:22] RowdyRoran: Thank god they made all ai art non-copyrightable
[3:07:25] steelxdawn: Kay when you gonna pull out the secret weapon.....BRAND
[3:07:31] J_to_the_jf: @RowdyRoran I think it's selfish for you to secure your job and force people to work with you/
[3:07:32] lewhitehd69: chat war nymnCorn
[3:07:49] watson1235: yea I get businesses get to make their own decisions but they are regularly abusing their employees so I won’t trust them to make moral decisions.
[3:08:04] mistermurr: At what trivia would you say you're good at KP?
[3:08:07] Smoothcollie: How are u are doing? How is your life lately?
[3:08:08] FiveFM: PopNemo PopCorn
[3:08:10] sabiirox: i want to get dinner but theres ppl in the kitchen 🫡 i hate living w housemates🫠

[3:08:13] aliorvt: I’m si hype about arcane season 2, I want to see how Viktor evolves joshsekiClap
[3:08:13] J_to_the_jf: @Smoothcollie actually not really cause I'm Canadian so there for I am legally not allowed to be president. IF someone is good at their job AI will not replace you my last thoughts on it
[3:08:17] Galetea: I blocked them im not dealing with someone narrowminded im just here to chill and watch league
[3:08:18] Viusthas: AI? Who's AI? don't know about AI

[3:10:54] Karimftw: @sabiirox I've never been into reality shows, watched paradise hotel a few years ago and that was painful too
[3:10:58] RowdyRoran: @J_to_the_jf Idk man, I get plenty of commissions, I'm done with the convo.
[3:11:15] Karimftw: @lewhitehd69 well not complete darkness but they can't see each other and then have to get married if they want to meet
[3:11:23] somicam: somicam subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! ^_^
[3:11:27] AflamingN00B: @sabiirox  If you look up the definition of cringe in a dictionary there is a reference to swedish tv right there NotLikeThis

[3:45:06] stefansimplyy: we need your top to get tiltet for a sec 😂
[3:45:07] weecore: heard a story about Room Raider producers, and how EVERY dude would clean up even when they were told not to, so the producers would TRASH the rooms
[3:45:08] Viusthas: @CipherAdminShady that sounds kinda fucked up
[3:45:19] steelxdawn: Kay watched EVERY reality show in existence lol
[3:45:32] stefansimplyy: why i dont have blue bomb on name 😢
[3:45:36] CynicalScrub: ooooh you have a jim support.  xerath only
[3:45:36] AflamingN00B: I had this great idea for a dating show. It's called "Average guys on Tinder: A study in loneliness"  Kappa
[3:45:40] stefansimplyy: oh there we go
[3:46:02] steelxdawn: @AflamingN00B LOL
[3:46:16] HelloOctoberly: thank you. We appreciate your sympathy
[3:46:18] Galetea: Big same
[3:46:20] steelxdawn: when it comes to dating.....WE ARE DOOMED
[3:46:26] nassimiheb: don't date focus on science
[3:46:27] mistermurr: Well thank you kaypLOL kaypLOL
[3:46:28] BRBSTARGAZING: As someone currently dealing with it...yes LOL. It's rough out there.
[3:46:30] elsamelba: thank god I’m in a long term relationship because I could NOT go back to dating on apps
[3:46:30] jtschecki: Just don’t date, love comes on its own ellabaLove
[3:46:31] HelloOctoberly: single mom trying to date. awful.
[3:46:34] nicolasxduarte: Tinder ain't good anymore, bumble is a little bit better
[3:46:37] catastrofia: It's so bad KP! I'm single and looking and its like "ghost ghost ghost one night stand ghost"
[3:46:41] Galetea: I'm dating my best friend. Known him 10 years and been dating 6
[3:46:46] leggingsPT: I was lucky enough to find a good boyfriend in tinder 5 years ago, we are still together and happy
[3:46:46] Viusthas: who needs a partner when you have reality TV to entertain your life
[3:46:50] gaijin4: well i have given up lol
[3:46:55] Smoothcollie: My friend got her boyfriend via tinder. And it was like a first or second guy she texted via it
[3:46:58] Cut_n_Run: some of these dating apps are using AI now to block out certain images @KayPea
[3:47:05] Smoothcollie: And like a fcking good bf
[3:47:17] CynicalScrub: it's hard enough to make new friends these days, let alone date
[3:47:34] lewhitehd69: EZ
[3:47:37] Sunnytinker: i mean bot should of expected the lvl 6 kat roam
[3:47:40] xBoomShotBaby: and this Xerath dares to ping you kaypLOL
[3:47:44] aty212121: BoooM outplayed
[3:47:48] stefansimplyy: that was so smooth
[3:47:51] stefansimplyy: love it
[3:47:52] SeaOfKiLLeR: Kappa
[3:47:53] Galetea: My friend found someone on bumble. Dated her for like a year and she was something. LIke not a good smth, like needed to go see a therapist someone. I felt so bad for him
[3:47:58] DarkSaionara: Grindr is even worse than tinder
[3:48:06] elsamelba: I have a friend (absolutely beautiful with a great personality) coming off a 6 years relationship and she’s trying to date on tinder/bumble without getting one night stands only and it’s IMPOSSIBLE
[3:48:09] calicoastal: I feel like girls have it easier on dating apps than guys
[3:48:10] steelxdawn: @Smoothcollie for WOMEN its alot easier....especially if they are attractive
[3:48:24] steelxdawn: @calicoastal definitely
[3:48:28] Cut_n_Run: @calicoastal i wouldnt be sure about that one
[3:48:32] calicoastal: Iet my current bf through hinge
[3:48:36] Smoothcollie: !cannon
[3:48:37] Nightbot: KayPea has missed: 1197 cannon minions Clap
[3:48:37] Gar116: @DarkSaionara I don't think you should be looking for dates on there haha. It can happen though!
[3:48:41] Smoothcollie: Saw that kaypSpy
[3:48:50] lewhitehd69: who needs tinder when you have twitch chat, anyone here single and ready to mingle? ratirlSmug
[3:48:58] CynicalScrub: @KayPea can we do a "dating in the basement" show and help us all find love?!?!
[3:48:59] xDrewx: I met someone on Twitch actually. I'm in US and they're in AU. Been dating for two years. @KayPea Long distance sucks though.
[3:49:01] AflamingN00B: @elsamelba  Women are priviliged that way.
[3:49:07] DarkSaionara: @Gar116 I met my current boyfriend there, so, not sure about thet ahah
[3:49:08] Viusthas: @calicoastal uh depends, women get so many creeps that's fucking ridiculous
[3:49:25] xBoomShotBaby: kaypLOL kaypLOL
[3:50:37] adnanech: how
[3:50:49] HydroMerano: If you get married from meeting on twitch, is Poggers in your vows? XD
[3:50:56] calicoastal: Women can definitely be picky. You just have to shut a lot down before you find some gems
[3:50:56] CptnFalcon4Prez: why not get ludens to help with wave clear?
[3:50:57] DarkSaionara: @Viusthas yes, and men are afraid to be rejected and women are afraid to get murdered. Huge difference
[3:50:58] FiveFM: Happens after Love in an Elevator... on the way down to the basement.
[3:51:01] elsamelba: @galetea I’m the same and I think it wouldn’t be suitable at all for us
[3:51:01] Viusthas: @calicoastal Sadly not all creeps can be distinguished. How many stories of women getting stalked (and some other absolutely amazing stuff) by seemingly normal men are there? compared to men stories, a lot
[3:51:06] elliviant: elliviant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! HIIIIIII
[3:51:06] nicolasxduarte: You should do a dating show
[3:51:07] elliviant: HIIIIIIII
[3:51:08] GhostyTBear99: I met/found my wife through aram on league haha
[3:51:09] call_me_teaa: @Galetea yeah sadly we live in a time and age where everyone just.. minds their own business? i guess that's the correct expression? and it's a all time high for loneliness, there is no real connection, only superficial stuff. idk how to word it
[3:51:13] Galetea: @lilypips My bf and i are also long distance! I cant wait to be where you are and live with him! Congrats! LuvHearts
[3:51:13] catastrofia: i met a boyfriend on world of warcraft back in the day. we moved in together and dated for 4 years
[3:51:14] elliviant: oops i didnt mean to do that twice
[3:51:23] khadapys: nice KayPea <3
[3:51:32] lewhitehd69: @catastrofia was it a rogue main? ratirlBusiness
[3:51:34] Darkcyter: @elliviant WB
[3:51:39] lilypips: @Galetea you'll get there!! it's coming up to 2 years for us and this is our first place! Thank u friend :3 <3
[3:51:39] Galetea: @call_me_teaa Nah nah I totally get what you're saying you're right
[3:51:49] calicoastal: @viusthas yeah but that's why you take precautions when you date and keep it public
[3:52:02] nicolasxduarte: What's that ahri skin?
[3:52:03] lewhitehd69: pepeJAMJAM pepeJAMJAM pepeJAMJAM pepeJAMJAM pepeJAMJAM
[3:52:05] catastrofia: @lewhitehd69 it was a priest main. I was the rogue :x
[3:52:08] elliviant: wooowowow i love ur hair today!!
[3:52:16] AflamingN00B: I don't think women can even imagine swiping right 2000 times and getting 0.1 % matches LUL
[3:52:17] Galetea: @elsamelba I'm lucky with the guy I'm with rn. He lets me set how far we go. It's been 5 years and we havent even kissed. He's a saint for allowing me to feel it out
[3:52:22] steelxdawn: @catastrofia Lots of people met on World of warcraft.
[3:52:22] AptApeArt: all u have to do is start a private palworld server and all your friends from decades past will come flocking back to hang out and u will have an exhausting amount of social connection
[3:52:27] lewhitehd69: @catastrofia ratirlDetective time to become priest main
[3:52:45] watson1235: a bunch of people I play eso with have dated/married with mixed success
[3:52:45] HelloOctoberly: i met 1 ex husband and 1 ex boyfriend on world of warcraft.
[3:52:53] Dercking: Hi KayPea!
[3:53:05] Viusthas: @calicoastal Of course but there's honestly just more risks when you're a woman than a man. Let's be fair, people on dating apps don't face the same problems. Women usually face some issues and men face other issues
[3:53:17] LythelliaBelmont: I met my BF through Final Fantasy 14. We are together 6 years now and have a Daughter kaypLove
[3:53:22] elliviant: ahri, destroyer of turrets
[3:53:22] CynicalScrub: am i the only person who thinks palworld looks dumb and has no interest in it?
[3:53:26] xBoomShotBaby: seems like Kata doesnt wanna deal with you
[3:53:27] elliviant: kaypCheer kaypCheer
[3:53:34] lewhitehd69: @CynicalScrub holy BASED
[3:53:42] Galetea: @CynicalScrub You are not alone LUL
[3:53:48] Smoothcollie: @steelxdawn Don't look for someone rn, so won't judge. Just know girls can have problems finding someone as well. I told that story just how lucky one can get. Cuz he is one of a Hella good bf, isn't toxic at all, clever and cooks for her. I couldn't be happier, cuz she got a toixc bfs in past Sadge
[3:53:48] calicoastal: @viusthas yeah but women face risks just EXISTING lol
[3:53:51] CynicalScrub: high 5 to you guys then
[3:53:52] watson1235: @cynicalscrub I played like 15 min and was like this is bad ark survival with wish Pokémon.
[3:53:53] elliviant: wow that brand slow is brutal
[3:53:55] khadapys: i don't have boyfriend. one one wants me :( unlucky life!
[3:53:57] ferriswheel8: @CynicalScrub Same, looks clunky and like werid
[3:53:59] mouritchou: clean
[3:54:00] mistermurr: Next reality show: Love is only one basement away
[3:54:02] Galetea: Ahri the tower toppler
[3:54:03] SeaOfKiLLeR: in and out baby
[3:54:05] Diadrin: Okay that was nice not wasting ult
[3:54:13] xBoomShotBaby: @mistermurr kaypLOL kaypLOL
[3:54:19] Viusthas: @calicoastal which is very depressing. I shouldn't be running home past 8pm instead of peacefully walking bc someone is behind me
[3:54:30] mistermurr: kaypLOL
[3:54:35] Smoothcollie: kaypLUL kaypLUL kaypLUL
[3:54:38] xBoomShotBaby: um
[3:54:38] calicoastal: Agreed!
[3:54:40] CynicalScrub: this kat is special
[3:54:46] elliviant: @ferriswheel8 its very fun!! keep in mind its still early access :)
[3:54:46] stefansimplyy: kata at this point just give up hahaha
[3:54:51] xBoomShotBaby: seems like she gave up
[3:54:55] AflamingN00B: @khadapys  Spend 5 minutes on Tinder and you'd have more matches than I get in a year LUL
[3:55:12] calicoastal: Sad that we have to take extra measures to protect ourselves, or purposefully cross streets to avoid men at night
[3:55:13] ferriswheel8: @elliviant Yeah maybe someday, thanks for sharing <3
[3:55:22] proxxxy2_: heyyy kelsieeeeeee
[3:55:25] atum__: kata so desperate
[3:55:29] HydroMerano: Thats an Int. Lmao

[3:55:44] ajak636: kaypLOL kaypLOL kaypLOL
[3:55:48] khadapys: @AflamingN00B i don't trust tinder :(
[3:55:59] stefansimplyy: true hahaha
[3:56:16] CynicalScrub: you know what i hate lately?  the number of bots on twitter/X who just spam follow people
[3:56:17] Deviousnessss: Deviousnessss subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Happy monday!! Glad to be back :D
[3:56:26] proxxxy2_: why pick kat into ahri
[3:56:29] stefansimplyy: u need to duo with this vi
[3:56:42] AflamingN00B: @khadapys  I guess loneliness is a choice for some people...
[3:56:43] Viusthas: @calicoastal Absolutely. But that sadly will never change
[3:56:44] stefansimplyy: u two maded this game hella easy
[3:56:47] Darkcyter: @Deviousnessss a year kaypHYPERS WB
[3:57:11] MegaZerino: MegaZerino subscribed with Prime. 
[3:57:36] stefansimplyy: yeh kp just type /ff let us see something 🤔🤔🤔
[3:57:37] elsamelba: absolutely
[3:57:38] elliviant: my boyfriend left to go on a mini 4 day vacation with his friends, so im home all alone :C but at least i got kp's stream to keep me company ^^
[3:57:39] xBoomShotBaby: you always find the one when you least expect it kaypFlower
[3:57:42] bluesiies: ahri's tail is so pretty with this skin wtf
[3:57:48] Deviousnessss: @Darkcyter Thank you so much!! kaypVibe
[3:57:50] watson1235: I need to figure out my own shit before I add someone else’s to my life 🤣
[3:57:51] mistermurr: I'm still disturbed about that moms/sons show you mentioned earlier kaypAwkward I searched about and ep 1 is the moms feeling the guys torso to see who can pick their son first, like wtf kaypAwkward
[3:57:52] lewhitehd69: i have converted who needs love all i need is myself
[3:57:57] Deviousnessss: How are you games going girl?
[3:57:58] lewhitehd69: GIGACHAD
[3:57:58] Darkcyter: Not everyone needs dating either, there's a difference between loneliness and solitude
[3:57:58] Viusthas: people being like "you're 23 and not married?? What have you been doing??" uh, having fun?
[3:58:06] AflamingN00B: Dating is a race. Every year spent is a year closer to dying alone...
[3:58:15] proxxxy2_: a lot of pressure too with dating, like its fine if ur single lol
[3:58:18] jakabolta: why did i heard you say n word
[3:58:18] catastrofia: dating always sucks until you find the one.
[3:58:31] khadapys: @AflamingN00B i think u are right... ^^
[3:58:39] xBoomShotBaby: you gotta love yourself first
[3:58:41] stefansimplyy: @viusthas w8 +3 more years
[3:58:42] HydroMerano: It took me a long time to learn to love myself and that made everything else just icing on the cake. It made me learn to be happy with just myself, and not need another person to feel validated.
[3:58:42] Galetea: @Darkcyter Absolutely true. My sister is ace and just wants a cat and her own space
[3:58:42] bluesiies: how did you and lucas meet? i want to hear your love story quantLove
[3:58:59] ferriswheel8: @jakabolta she said mega, but i also got confused lol
[3:59:01] stefansimplyy: you will get asked that question every time
[3:59:11] sabiirox: lmao did kat just flash💀
[3:59:16] DarkSaionara: yeah, a lot of people are aromantic and asexual
[3:59:25] Daddy_Shoe: i didnt have a long term relationship until i was 21 and now im happily married with a son and one on the way
[3:59:28] elsamelba: my best friend does not want to date at all and she has a very fulfilled life. that’s just how life pans out for some people kaypLove
[3:59:29] proxxxy2_: and loving urself comes with being with yourself being alone
[3:59:35] xBoomShotBaby: damn no surrender vote
[3:59:36] kingdomofblue: haven't been single for 10 years but I remember my last date from before because of HOW BAD it was lmao. I ended up crawling out the bathroom window at the resturant we were at
[3:59:38] AflamingN00B: People who says that you don't need anyone to be happy haven't spent a lifetime alone LUL
[3:59:40] jakabolta: yes you said mega but i heard n word xddd
[3:59:44] MsErwyna: I mean I am currently expecting my first child, but I dont have a partner. I learned that I would prioritize having a child, instead of finding a partner. I feel like there is so much pressure on people needing to find someone.
[3:59:52] makrem_mrabet: god bless for the man ur in  hes life :)
[3:59:58] Darkcyter: @Galetea Straight-ace here, if that's a thing, but being in a 3rd world country I'm constantly being pressured to marry, the only logic that sticks is - "When you'll be an old man, you'll need a wife and children to take care of you"
[4:00:11] Galetea: @Daddy_Shoe BIG this. I didnt start dating until 21 as well. And two tries and I found my current bf that I'm absolutely committed and gonna marry
[4:00:12] HydroMerano: Its absolutely a thing Dark
[4:00:21] ferriswheel8: @MsErwyna That's actually amazing, i wish you all the best <3
[4:00:25] stefansimplyy: love those themes
[4:00:26] HydroMerano: romantic feelings don't necessarily have to match sexual feelings at all @Darkcyter
[4:00:34] bluesiies: how did you and lucas meet?
[4:00:37] Darkcyter: @HydroMerano I got neither
[4:00:45] MsErwyna: @ferriswheel8 Thank you <3
[4:00:47] HydroMerano: and thats a beautiful thing! :D
[4:00:50] lewhitehd69: ppPoof
[4:00:58] StTimmy: kills enemy mid, gets the cannon, it's agood game
[4:01:01] Daddy_Shoe: @Galetea my dad didnt marry my mom until he was 38, everyone is on their own timeline
[4:01:04] Galetea: @Darkcyter I get that. My sister was pressured too bc "who will take care of you if you're sick" And my bf and I were like "UM WE WILL?!" like siblings can be there for someone too. It doesnt have to be a s/o
[4:01:16] khadapys: this game is sad for Kata :D
[4:01:33] Viusthas: chat's been through a lot of deep conversations today
[4:01:33] Dumbmuto: @lewhitehd69 zentreOhMy am I late for date
[4:01:39] RaynKire: Big Basement topics today
[4:01:40] CynicalScrub: i put my points on doubters cuz i thought there was no way doubters would win.  shocking

[4:02:02] MsErwyna: ggs!
[4:02:04] CynicalScrub: @KayPea doubters with the huge upset
[4:02:06] Darkcyter: @Galetea Well tbh, it IS a valid concern, we don't realize it when we're young, we can shake it off even if we get sick, but in old age you do need some care, I hope I don't live that long kaypLUL
[4:02:06] mistermurr: Didn't think so many people were interested in reality shows
[4:02:06] watson1235: dang nice win

[4:02:37] watson1235: @cynicalscrub are we doubters or optimists? 🤣
[4:02:38] TWanderer: Going to yell at Lucas for Q?
[4:02:41] akimonkey: bad relationships can give good experience. you learn bout yourself, how to be a good partner, priorities etc. that’s why I appreciate past relationships
[4:02:41] Dumbmuto: @lewhitehd69 nepuHeh please don't choose the one I worked
