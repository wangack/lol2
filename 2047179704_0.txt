[0:42:34] sh00xie: @ipav999 same feeling for me 100% agree
[0:42:41] sh00xie: I tried this kind of build
[0:43:00] SzDredd: @ipav999 League system mechanics
[0:43:13] SzDredd: not for Riven in general
[0:45:56] Breathe234: peepoHey
[0:45:58] trombonator420: poor riven main cries about not being able to win the game from a single kill, so sad... BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:46:28] SzDredd: the point is they dumb down the game
[0:46:39] SzDredd: to be noobs friendly
[0:46:45] trombonator420: is that bad?
[0:46:52] SzDredd: it is
[0:47:01] trombonator420: how
[0:47:01] SzDredd: check next 2 minutes or so
[0:47:22] trombonator420: league always was a dumbed down dota
[0:47:36] trombonator420: you want deep game just go play dota my friend
[0:48:08] falcon3939: @trombonator420 nobody cares about dota why are u in the stream
[0:48:22] trombonator420: ??
[0:48:35] trombonator420: i need your permission to be here?
[0:48:40] 514484: mayeb that's a good idea honestly
[0:48:48] 514484: the problem is we get attached to champions here
[0:50:17] trombonator420: the problem here is people get attached to flowcharts and when some mechanics change they dont want to adapt
[0:50:37] GrylloBH: that was insane
[0:50:41] trombonator420: oh riven matchup
[0:50:51] GrylloBH: enemy is back to lane before you can complete a recall
[0:50:51] 514484: losing money when you die in dota was traumatic LUL
[0:51:32] trombonator420: @ipav999 as i said - poor riven main cries about not being able to win the game from a single kill LUL LUL LUL
[0:53:40] GrylloBH: only the teemo disbalance was insane
[0:53:55] trombonator420: teemo too strong for the game
[0:53:55] GrylloBH: they botched the teemo too soon
[0:54:00] schieba: give my q scaling back
[0:54:25] dwarf_on_the_bridge: Why Tolien names city of elves as "Riven dell"
[0:54:40] dwarf_on_the_bridge: Tolkien*
[0:55:02] 514484: teemo needs AD ratio so that he can use Hexplate like Udyr in the coming patch
[0:55:14] GrylloBH: rito don't want to have teemo viable competitively
[0:56:52] trombonator420: @ipav999 low tier players are bad at neutral, learning fighting games helped me get better at that LUL
[0:59:10] trombonator420: @ipav999 nah im saying about neutral state in the lane, teemo is basically all about it
[0:59:53] trombonator420: and lower tier players often struggle with playing neutral
[1:04:17] trombonator420: stormsurge dCap LUL
[1:04:35] suppaahh: thats why I would go lich this game instead of nashor
[1:05:45] kablooom: lichbane is better for teemo this season but i dont think its enough
[1:06:31] kablooom: shadowflame first item will let you 1 shot caster minions
[1:07:32] kablooom: no help from mininos
[1:07:48] trombonator420: lichbane is not as versatile as nashors though

[1:22:17] 514484: become Udyr top main EZ
[1:22:32] RodNimrod: I'm out of the loop. Teemo's WR only increases the higher the rank gets, peaking at 58% in Chall. Why is this the worst season for Teemo?
[1:22:36] kuma_0_4: palworld?
[1:22:47] FemboyTarkov: among us
[1:23:40] RodNimrod: is that not just genshin impact?
[1:24:57] kablooom: BOOBA
[1:25:15] Cororonoa: Has Riot reversed the Teemo nerfs yet?
[1:25:34] RodNimrod: they hotfix buffed him now his WR is through the roof again
[1:25:39] RodNimrod: but no full revert, no
[1:25:51] pbompet: is teemo actually THAT good?
[1:26:03] Cororonoa: Malignance was a bit overtuned
[1:26:20] RodNimrod: 58 WR in chall
[1:26:25] RodNimrod: and 54% in master+
[1:26:25] Cororonoa: 58!!!
[1:26:27] Cororonoa: wow
[1:27:28] EtoDelirium: mortdoGChatting I'm in bronze DinoDance

[1:28:55] Cororonoa: not much representation
[1:28:57] RodNimrod: try lolalytics, it is more accurate and takes into account the hotfix
[1:29:02] Cororonoa: sample size too small
[1:29:07] RodNimrod: whereas opgg is just the patch in general
[1:29:50] RodNimrod: Teemo is 53% in KR since the hotfix
[1:29:57] RodNimrod: in Masters+
[1:30:30] RodNimrod: lolalytics is more accurate

[1:31:43] EtoDelirium: Cuz they abuse haunting gyre mask or whatever
[1:31:45] Cororonoa: Only five players
[1:31:49] SzDredd: and is this WR after the patch
[1:31:52] Cororonoa: haunting guise
[1:32:01] SzDredd: or it is cumulative one
[1:32:11] williazom: it's after the last patch
[1:32:26] serrolo: check this mastery points
[1:32:32] Cororonoa: wrecked
[1:33:19] Cororonoa: Teemo is an endangered species
[1:33:25] SzDredd: https://www.op.gg/summoners/kr/07%EB%85%84%EC%83%9D%20%ED%8B%B0%EB%AA%A8%EC%9E%A5%EC%9D%B8-KR1
[1:33:33] SzDredd: last 20 games - 45%
[1:33:56] Cororonoa: I don't think, it's too hard
[1:33:56] EtoDelirium: Hwei with unnecessary buffs TPFufun
[1:33:56] SzDredd: overall WR -54
[1:34:10] Ammo0o: teemo
[1:34:15] Ammo0o: no tuti
[1:34:18] SzDredd: so wr after the patch is not the same as wr for the season
[1:37:33] Cororonoa: Teemo isn't a playmaker
[1:38:06] Cororonoa: Teemo is anti-playmaking
[1:38:14] Cororonoa: traps are anti-plays
[1:38:53] Cororonoa: Shaco actually IS a playmaker
[1:39:32] Cororonoa: use everything
[1:40:32] serrolo: i usually use traps to avoid ganks
[1:40:37] Cororonoa: How to Teemo: Q the auto-attackers
[1:41:24] thriagro: true
[1:43:03] Cororonoa: wait for Morgana Q, then ult
[1:43:17] 291x: @RodNimrod i went to that website and teemo is ranked 46 of all champs. rated D- tier. and that 52.94 win rate, Almost all other champs have more win rate on that list.
[1:43:40] Cororonoa: joking
[1:43:57] GrylloBH: morgana, is that a champion? I don't think so
[1:44:11] GrylloBH: haven't they deleted morgana like 3 years ago?
[1:44:54] Cororonoa: Teemo can go invisible
[1:45:19] kareemyousefquit: hi
[1:45:30] Cororonoa: because it's for anti-plays and counter engaging
[1:45:44] kareemyousefquit: hi @ipav999
[1:46:22] Cororonoa: Didn't they rework the cooldown system so Ultimate Cooldown is now a unique passive separate from regular cooldowns?
[1:47:19] Wolt_Han: so basically play a high damage mage with easy to land skills (posibbly not skill-shots)  to win on high tier ?
[1:49:05] Wolt_Han: teemo,sona and xerath
[1:49:15] Wolt_Han: I feel bad for these champs
[1:49:15] Cororonoa: I play Teemo like a ranged Singed, I spend a lot of time running and proxying
[1:49:55] franko420_: ipavHappy
[1:50:51] Wolt_Han: when you have champs like k'sante or ww against teemo his q doesn't really do much either
[1:51:31] Wolt_Han: yea I hate playing sett against teemo for example LUL
[1:52:32] Wolt_Han: I mean you can technically play any hero ad but yeah no ad scaling kinda diminishes the possibilities
[1:53:16] BOTTLEOFFIZZ: do you think the mas build would be viable for twitch or even cassio ?
[1:53:42] BOTTLEOFFIZZ: mask**
[1:53:46] BOTTLEOFFIZZ: my bad
[1:54:05] Wolt_Han: which mask LUL
[1:54:22] BOTTLEOFFIZZ: well ttiwtch nashosrs into 3 guise similar to teemo build
[1:54:41] BOTTLEOFFIZZ: haunting guise you know what i mean lol
[1:55:06] BOTTLEOFFIZZ: yes that one
[1:55:24] GrylloBH: Are we watching the taino as?
[1:55:28] GrylloBH: ADC?
[1:55:46] BOTTLEOFFIZZ: Didn't think of singed to be hoenst.
[1:56:00] kablooom: hard to land Q
[1:56:06] kablooom: I saw ad ziggs earlier
[1:56:07] GrylloBH: Difficult to land and ez to dodge
[1:56:33] kablooom: doesnt have to hit ground
[1:57:06] kablooom: oh ziggs
[1:57:45] kablooom: if riot would change one small aspect of teemo mechanics what would you choose. Just one.

[2:21:29] SzDredd: webtoon is KR manga
[2:21:45] chokexvi: theres a webtoon for it
[2:22:02] chokexvi: i thought it was chinese so manhua
