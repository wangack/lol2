[7:15:29] intingkarthus: Pog
[7:15:50] PlasmaWave985: @parox3tine If your lane opponent prevents you from farming, then you often just let the wave push into you and farm under tower. Gold is less important early than XP, so just sit in XP range and don't take terrible trades to farm early.
[7:16:36] parox3tine: not what i was talking bout i meant last hitting buddy
[7:17:34] Howlyy_: @parox3tine just watch how Naayil does it and you will learn
