[1:27:55] misMATTch: I think less pros played solo queue this frequently
[1:27:57] catdir: do you watch lec?
[1:28:00] CSleep: agree, live patch adds an element of excitement back for me. If anything as a placebo.
[1:28:01] mirrortat: the dive got a shoutout in lec today
[1:28:17] SteeledAutumn: they also have the intgar tho so balances out
[1:28:21] swophe: they got the rengar this time it‚Äôs a win

[2:18:05] arkhaos440: highest winrate from Koreans is W first then E
[2:18:18] hamzaav: vlcnDIFF
[2:19:02] arkhaos440: that's what op'gg says
[2:19:15] BalloonHorses: u see, taric is easy bc you just max e every game and it's straightforward
[2:19:17] ServiusWolf: guys i think apa is fed
[2:19:44] Skarmori: azir did not plan ahead
[2:19:46] Wunderlol: everyone does e
[2:19:49] Peaseed: scream across the house and ask your analysts LUL
[2:19:49] Wunderlol: some people do 3pt q
[2:19:50] nickleus6: is palafox, apa's dad?
[2:19:51] Shusaiku: lolalytics says that for KR Master+ E max is still both highest winrate and most common for rell
[2:20:20] arkhaos440: funny that op.gg and lolalytics aren't the same

[2:21:50] CSleep: Zeyzal's an OG, put some respect
[2:22:08] keayed1980: That's why I specifically said Zeyzal, becaue he's quite good.
[2:22:26] Skarmori: they always live 1 hp
[2:22:26] keayed1980: And he WAS on C9... So I'm a bit saddened
[2:23:11] CSleep: Game has gone a bit of a fiesta lol
[2:23:26] ServiusWolf: game of throws
[2:24:16] arkhaos440: @Shusaiku yeah, I guess until you get real high elo they prefer W first
[2:24:18] Daxter264: are the games going better?
[2:24:35] njordan7: how could jhin go lethality this game?
[2:24:42] ServiusWolf: we just need one blue game in the sea of red games
[2:24:45] Jedski: this is game 1 of a 5 game win streak
[2:25:02] Shusaiku: @arkhaos440 i like e max a lot more tbh .. until you put some points into e once youre in its kinda to get out imo
[2:25:13] njordan7: does the champ just suck?

[2:27:13] nkbsteam: Noice~ at the last pixel
[2:27:17] njordan7: @arkhaos440 jhin going lethality
[2:27:35] arkhaos440: @njordan7 no, that's his strongest build right now
[2:28:01] njordan7: @arkhaos440 then is jhin just bad?
[2:28:04] Gyousel: they changed how lethality works
[2:28:22] BalloonHorses: surely yall can end with one more engage
[2:28:50] BalloonHorses: neverminddd
[2:29:11] arkhaos440: @njordan7 this jhin isn't great
[2:29:14] CSleep: TF EWWW
[2:30:30] CSleep: helping the super minions ge ttheir cs
[2:31:04] arkhaos440: sick move
[2:31:11] njordan7: @arkhaos440 i play jhin and it feels you need a mage to win lane
[2:32:12] CSleep: Did he go after the Jhin you think since jhin ulted
[2:32:36] arkhaos440: @njordan7 lethality isn't what it was before, mages and tanks both got huge upgrades in v14
[2:33:16] Homosensual: Hello Vulcan, handsome as always :)
[2:33:34] Nightbot: Follow my Instagram so follower count goes high! https://www.instagram.com/vulcan.lol/
[2:33:38] arkhaos440: yeah TF even with buffs just feels bad
[2:34:16] CSleep: TF buffs were a distraction it seems lol
[2:34:27] bowserchops: Vulcan! big fan dude first time follow first time chadder- you on eg got me into esports , now c9 team Canada let‚Äôs go!!! do you have a tam kench pair you guys are cooking up?
[2:35:21] majormuted: monkaS
[2:35:47] beemw3: gotta respect the comeback tho
[2:35:59] arkhaos440: TF should be building on-hit, that's what got the buffs... he's inting you so bad
[2:35:59] bowserchops: he has scaled
[2:37:03] arkhaos440: all the move speed, worlds fastest Rell Engage!
[2:37:22] bowserchops: is deadman‚Äôs still a thing
[2:38:00] arkhaos440: @bowserchops yeah, but trailblazer is like a cheap version (supp item) and he already has it
[2:38:19] bowserchops: ah i haven‚Äôt checked the new supp items
[2:38:47] CSleep: the negative baron power play
[2:39:04] nkbsteam: very ambitious, yet so close
[2:39:10] TylerBroski: @arkhaos440 i would consider that build pretty on hit
[2:39:44] bowserchops: maokai jhin ult feels nice
[2:40:03] Gyousel: Whats with mid trist players thinking they are galio
[2:40:16] BalloonHorses: this game feels like a bituva throw
[2:41:00] arkhaos440: @TylerBroski what items there have on-hit procs? Lichbane is a critical item
[2:41:11] TylerBroski: @arkhaos440 kraken and blade both have on hit procs
[2:41:25] SteeledAutumn: AD tf a bait?
[2:41:37] bowserchops: gota go AD tf stormrazor
[2:42:01] TylerBroski: @TylerBroski not to mention guinsoos being the obvious
[2:42:06] CSleep: without comms it might be a bait
[2:42:12] njordan7: Sadge
[2:42:16] SteeledAutumn: insane rumble ult coverage
[2:42:23] BalloonHorses: Your loss streak will coincidentally end when you pick taric
[2:42:29] njordan7: top just ran it
[2:42:51] SteeledAutumn: your nami wave match history  is so due
[2:43:04] njordan7: off tank would have been better
[2:44:11] TylerBroski: @TylerBroski actually if you want to be even more technical, rfc is also on hit once the charge is done.. so all of them
[2:44:14] phantomstarlol: tristana is APA
[2:44:15] arkhaos440: @TylerBroski bork sure, but every 3rd on kraken isn't really on-hit
[2:45:10] SteeledAutumn: enchanter supp with tf?
[2:45:40] generalslicey: so jojo hit us with the one and done stream?
[2:46:12] arkhaos440: @TylerBroski he has ok on-hit but TF scales better AP on-hit
[2:46:34] jordangx: yeah it was brain ping
[2:46:45] An_Actual_Ape: yo whats up vulcan
[2:46:47] TylerBroski: @arkhaos440 oh yeah i'm not defending the build, i haven't played the game in like a year. i was just saying it's definitely an on-hit build
[2:47:06] jordangx: do you like poutine or caribou more
[2:47:14] mirrortat: omg we lost 4 in a row on 4 different champs
[2:47:17] mirrortat: unluckyyyyyyy
[2:47:48] Frostfeverr: zyra to break the curse

[2:54:42] BalloonHorses: that was ablazeolive's fault, taric doesnt take damage

[2:57:32] bowserchops: those glowing blue orbs give me anxiety at 3 lol
[2:57:49] BalloonHorses: my man needs to stop missing taric e
[2:57:59] BalloonHorses: you can never kill taric unless taric kills himself
[2:58:09] BalloonHorses: TARIC DIFF!!!
[2:58:14] BalloonHorses: i tried warning you phil
[2:58:39] arkhaos440: this MF keeps getting hit by Taric dazzles

[3:05:23] njordan7: taric with best play completely counters brand
[3:06:37] bowserchops: hmm zombie ward gives you some ap I like it
[3:07:04] BalloonHorses: can confirm as this chat's resident silver taric expert, you cant win lane against brand
[3:07:19] BalloonHorses: i will say, if you're able to get into melee range vs brand on taric, you win
[3:07:22] captviet: bigggg
[3:07:31] bowserchops: wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äòsilver expert‚Äô qualify as an oxymoron lol
[3:07:45] BalloonHorses: @bowserchops Yeah that's the joke lol
[3:07:54] bowserchops: oh I love jokes
[3:08:07] m_esse: @Vulcan_LoL I heard the 100T / DIG game had so many pauses that they decided to skip the C9/SR game to save time.

[3:23:47] njordan7: Kappa
[3:23:53] arkhaos440: he literally flashed into dazzle range
