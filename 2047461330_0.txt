[0:16:52] chipichipichapachapagr: Yeah I remember that game
[0:16:54] Coldgrave: if dun can't win on viktor
[0:16:56] Coldgrave: champ is bad
[0:17:01] chipichipichapachapagr: It was painful to watch
[0:17:05] Coldgrave: yeah you can't poke him out'
[0:17:20] BanditSteinkamp: In low elo ezreal hits skillshots but never goes to Autoattack, thus dealing no dmg
[0:17:27] roders_m8: taco's viktor is legit eavNod
[0:18:20] Coldgrave: whata bout
[0:18:21] Coldgrave: ashe
[0:18:22] MurphyyMurph: tyty

[0:18:31] hookiess: I feel like lucian always meta
[0:18:39] Matshiii: this meta is actually the most fun ive had especially with the item differences now
[0:18:42] Lichyness: ive seen a handful forcing lethality ashe?
[0:19:24] avantisavoia187: @4well_ aint no way what are the buffs
[0:19:26] Coldgrave: there is not
[0:19:30] Coldgrave: he is lying

[0:21:01] 4well_: sad
[0:21:04] Coldgrave: very
[0:21:20] Matshiii: how strong is ezreal karma right now?
[0:21:34] Coldgrave: I've been playing hwei, champ is mad fun and kinda giga broken rn
[0:21:37] Dubatt0: yea meanwhile i still hagve my sub cus i subbed for 6 months in advance
[0:21:40] doinks7: ye i ban ez
[0:21:44] 4well_: anyone know how to counter brand in jg?
[0:21:49] Coldgrave: ban it
[0:22:24] alekocc: @4well_  invade early
[0:22:40] chipichipichapachapagr: I need to start learning other ADCs cuz I usually go for cait, jhin and mf
[0:22:51] SuaveADC: hwei is D tier with 48% wr according to ugg idk how accurate that is though, doesnt seem very broken
[0:22:53] jhin4tun: i think shen is the most broken toplaner now
[0:22:58] gfuncle: I pulled my hamstring when I was a kid it sucked, took like 3 weeks
[0:23:04] Dubatt0: @IKeepItTaco ye currently stuck in bed/chair cus i cant walk from a back muscle injury
[0:23:11] gfuncle: And as you get older shit heals slower
[0:23:16] SuaveADC: surely you can say the same for all champions though
[0:23:38] SuaveADC: mind you i guess hwei has loads of skillshots
[0:23:47] Dubatt0: i deadlifted 550lbs at work cus of a small accident that couldve cost 40k+ dollars lol
[0:23:59] hookiess: It takes lots of time and you always have to be careful even if it heals for some time
[0:24:03] Matshiii: hwei is a champ you need to be smart about when/which abilities to use
[0:24:42] 4well_: @SuaveADC  i think this winrate is low bc of players picking it for first time adn losing c they doesnt how to trow good combo
[0:24:45] orvirith: hiii
[0:25:39] gfuncle: Yea when I pulled mine I couldn't walk on it at all for like a week
[0:26:00] Dubatt0: need to mute stream, playing farcry 6 and im too invested in the story
[0:26:07] hookiess: Don't push yourself it will make it worse
[0:26:11] SuaveADC: just wait till you turn 30 then you can pull your back just by standing up too quickly Kappa
[0:26:23] Rakkatoffz: yo!
[0:26:34] ttvPudd1n: @Dubatt0 cap lmao
[0:26:38] hookiess: I guess so
[0:26:41] RavensWing: Once it stops hurting yeah but build slowly
[0:26:45] Dubatt0: @Dubatt0 Clueless
[0:26:48] hookiess: But how hard dunno
[0:27:02] puchiro: ye you should just take it easy but you should keep it moving else it can get really stiff
[0:27:13] gfuncle: As long as it isn't causing pain you should be fine. A lot of people do stuff in pools for that adds a little extra resistance
[0:27:14] RavensWing: light cardio should be fine, but I would avoid weights
[0:27:31] jhinornojhiovana: i have a herniated disk and its been over a year and its still not fully healed. i am 20 eavPain
[0:27:46] vial_of_fear: as long as the training doesn’t aggravate the issue, you’re good. if it hurts it, change the movement to another
[0:28:12] Rakkatoffz: doing other muscle groups includes the chest aswell so that wont be a problem I think, and then just work your way up with the weights. My shoulder is still fked since 3 years back
[0:28:13] RavensWing: I had a knee operation at 19 and it still causes me issues at the age of 42 because I pushed myself too hard after having it done
[0:28:20] ttvPudd1n: @Dubatt0 clueless that youre lying or thay you deadlifted 550lbs LMAO
[0:28:25] SuaveADC: it sounds like you have delayed onset muscle soreness
[0:28:31] SuaveADC: hurts like a beach
[0:28:43] SailorPluto9: @IKeepItTaco im going to the store, want anything?
[0:29:05] turtle8or: I got a hurniated disk when i was 15. Currently 26. After you give it time to heal its good but it is easy to reinjure.  Sleeping with a pillow under your knees has helped me to take stress off the back
[0:29:06] starhabit: starhaStares
[0:29:07] roders_m8: ikeepitRARETHINK
[0:29:08] Dubatt0: @Dubatt0 lifted an engine off the ground and moved it cus it fell over on another car, and it completely destroyed my back so yea
[0:29:26] hookiess: At some point everything hurts and I feel like glass everything is breakable
[0:29:29] Dubatt0: now if i said i moved it like it was nothing, ye thats cap
[0:29:50] vial_of_fear: yup, tendon and ligament issues take forever to heal.
[0:30:09] nyxionite: Hello
[0:30:09] hookiess: I wanna go back to old days that feels like every injury goes away other morning
[0:30:18] turtle8or: is it still lethality snowball and crit if not winning lane?
[0:30:38] maw_of_malmortius: hello Taco, how are the supports today?
[0:30:53] FourJhinCookies: I suggest everyone find a stretching/flexibility routine. It helps alleviate a lot of everyday pain that people usualyl just blame getting older on

[0:39:23] hookiess: What a first game
[0:39:34] nyxionite: That's pretty cool
[0:39:37] skybobbles: you can get it customized wtf
[0:39:43] lethalbonsai: @hookiess wait this is first game ?
[0:40:02] gammarayblue: no adc is winning against Ezreal during early levels with the rtecent buffs tbh
[0:40:07] MihaiOSS: catJAM
[0:40:14] nyxionite: Hi bobbles otushoWave
[0:40:30] skybobbles: helloo nyx @nyxionite :)
[0:40:32] vanettinero: nice ezreal dmg
[0:40:32] lethalbonsai: @gammarayblue if supports play equaly then it depends on adc gap
[0:40:46] mariomds1: blitz and rengar took a lil nap
[0:40:47] lethalbonsai: but jhin blitz against ezreal and thresh would win with equal skills
[0:40:47] chipichipichapachapagr: it keeps getting worse lmao NotLikeThis
[0:40:51] MihaiOSS: blitz for sure is human xdding
[0:41:08] 4well_: what mistake u guys see playing against or with jhin most times?
[0:41:10] JackSkalliov: hey everyone nice cocks
[0:41:11] kalonaa45: @MihaiOSS he is literally a robot huh
[0:41:25] Shagidzun: looks ffable

[0:42:28] Nuzzload: is boots early overated on jhin now?
[0:42:49] mariomds1: it's called having main character syndrome. everyone thinks they're playing better. Sometimes you just need to accept other people are better. It's very hard to get into that mindset
[0:43:12] mariomds1: it helps with teamwork
[0:43:20] MihaiOSS: what a a game huh..

[1:49:36] qedofus: @ikeepittaco  Ad TF is better On-Hit (Needs gigagood attack moving and spacing)... Crit is better super late game
[1:49:48] HoleyShirt1: its defs not enough

[1:53:01] Dubatt0: @Trash_Saw he used to play dota
[1:53:04] NapNapoleon: Tobias goes rapidfire and such. It's like a 2 item build
[1:53:23] NapNapoleon: Of course, if you want to scale it's gonna take longer
[1:53:30] Trash_Saw: @Trash_Saw oh ok thx for telling

[1:55:53] Connarhea: Not meaning any disrespect but in recent streams you've seemed much more likely to speak out negatively on your opponents. I've watched you for years but recently it feels like league is hitting your mental. Is it the new season or something else?
[1:56:16] ochregizmo: is jhin mid playable
[1:56:33] Adoskyy: why you go flat hp instead of scaling hp in those mini runes?
[1:56:49] justcallmemaximilian: Ik dumb question but what does ghosting mean
