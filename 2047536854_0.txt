[0:31:03] molotnikov: And my girlfriend left me last weekend the day before I started my new job now I don't have her or my car to get to my new job Idk what to do
[0:31:22] molotnikov: Ik this is nothing to do with the stream but I just am so upset and wanted to share
[0:31:25] Lau_340: peepoPat molotnikov
[0:31:25] pureiinsanity: 5up got competition
[0:31:56] olavi14: Damn hope it gets better
[0:32:07] Lau_340: TRUEING life sucks sometimes
[0:32:33] heyitsmadss: @molotnikov sending love and positive vibes 5upL
[0:32:58] molotnikov: That is good advice thank you
[0:33:09] heyitsmadss: good advice 5up
[0:33:09] molotnikov: It just sucks i feel like I lost so much in such little time
[0:33:49] molotnikov: I'm 23 but I've never been on my feet and stable and I finally had the chance and it all went wrong
[0:34:06] raimundao03: 5up your MCL team is going to be so fun to watch!! 5upLUL
[0:34:18] molotnikov: But its gone now
[0:34:35] molotnikov: And so is my person :(
[0:35:13] Lau_340: maybe she just wasnt your person?
[0:35:25] molotnikov: Maybe
[0:36:24] GandorTheGreat: U sound ok (physically). At least u have this upside? Car can be replaced. U can't @molotnikov
[0:36:42] molotnikov: That is true
[0:36:52] molotnikov: But id rather just be gone too
[0:37:04] molotnikov: I was trying so hard
[0:37:12] sofijka78: That's very insightful
[0:38:10] molotnikov: I feel like such a burden to do that
[0:38:17] molotnikov: But your words are very helpful
[0:38:51] balletbunny: nodd
[0:39:07] Seiris: Part of not being a burden is knowing when to let people help too
[0:39:22] heyitsmadss: honestly one thing too that ive learned @molotnikov is that people want to be useful and valued too.
[0:39:22] molotnikov: I guess
[0:39:45] molotnikov: You guys are really wise
[0:39:49] heyitsmadss: asking for help is a way to be vulnerable and make someone else feel appreciated too in a way... idk if im describing it right
[0:40:15] heyitsmadss: some of my best friends came from me asking a question or just reaching out for smt, then reciprocating the same thing
[0:40:18] Seiris: It shows you do value them @heyitsmadss
[0:40:38] mackartist7: This chat is the sweetest ever <3
[0:40:45] heyitsmadss: yup @seiris
[0:41:03] molotnikov: I moved to Scotland 5 years ago and the only person I met was the girl that just left so I don't have people to reach out to really
[0:41:08] sofijka78: <3
[0:41:09] Seiris: @5up It may be the internet but most people are decent at the core, imo
[0:41:34] molotnikov: I have my parents but I feel so bad I've always needed there help and I just wanted to do it myself and I ruined my chance straight away
[0:41:41] 9fierce9: Whats the point of being mean when someones already down?
[0:41:50] molotnikov: You guys are right though I should stay positive but it seems so hard to do that
[0:42:11] mackartist7: @molotnikov don't know if it'll help much but you've always got the chat to talk to :) Discord if no one's in twitch chat
[0:42:31] heyitsmadss: of course its hard. but each day you do it it gets easier as long as you acknowledge everything going on
[0:42:32] molotnikov: This has helped to be honest
[0:42:45] Seiris: @molotnikov As someone who's been on the survivor end of this place, it sucks so much more to see someone you could have helped hang their hat
[0:43:33] MistysRainingGhostTown: mistyrainfallsprout06 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! hoi 5upFlower
[0:43:36] Seiris: If you're in that place, I'd ask you to think, why not just stick around?
[0:43:58] molotnikov: Wdym
[0:44:03] 2bnieroperator69z: @5up ok how is it fighting against dicord premade ques so far?
[0:44:51] Seiris: @molotnikov If you're in that place, it cant get worse, but given time, it will get better. May as well stick around, right?
[0:45:10] Gesus_Portal1: Meow
[0:45:25] molotnikov: Yeah you're right
[0:45:41] balletbunny: Meow
[0:45:42] molotnikov: Its just stuff was finally falling in place and it all got reversed
[0:46:09] Seiris: I get it
[0:46:30] Seiris: Especially in your 20s life can feel like a rollercoaster
[0:47:01] balletbunny: froggyLove
[0:47:38] Seiris: That just sounds like a bad time @5up
[0:47:40] Lau_340: having someone to vent to helps alot, if not a friend or family maybe a therapist
[0:48:05] GandorTheGreat: Ye 5up. U must have overcome quite unique challenges. Cudos to you
[0:48:22] Seiris: @Lau_340 or just the anon internet even, if you just wanna vent you'll not find a better void to scream into
[0:48:24] molotnikov: Thank  you everyone for the advice, I need to get some sleep and try my best tomorrow, I actually don't understand this game I used to follow from among us days but I wish you a good stream and thank you guys ill try my best it just suxks
[0:48:55] GandorTheGreat: Good luck @molotnikov
[0:48:55] Seiris: @molotnikov and maybe sleep a long time if you can, sleep heals your brain in so many ways
[0:49:09] zinzanish: Sleep well 5upNap

[1:10:37] Snout_Cabosh: do you need more attack speed?

[2:32:21] Zenntrale: how
[2:32:25] Zenntrale: is the night going
[2:32:57] pureiinsanity: ooo neeko counters Hwei because she can trasnform into minion and ignore R and take reduced dmg from QW
[2:33:16] shanmarie357: Cheer1
[2:33:17] pureiinsanity: yeah ik
[2:33:23] Zenntrale: how do you feel about hwei
[2:33:48] friendlyestdirt: I’ve been enjoying all the streams lately, recently got surgery and I’ve just been sitting in bed for what feels like an eternity so it’s nice to have something to watch
[2:33:51] pureiinsanity: QW doing half damage is the bigger reason
[2:33:59] Dathrelian: play ivern!
[2:34:33] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[2:34:50] briweb11: also only 102 subs until he has do a chat chooses champ day
[2:34:53] pureiinsanity: easy wins if you duo with ant's renata lol
[2:34:58] coolwaveofcalm: Why did the sub count go down??? We were at 1100 or higher?
[2:34:58] Dathrelian: thats a great deal but you would only need 1 ivern game to get a win
[2:35:04] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[2:35:13] 9fierce9: Only exception is Graves

[2:36:26] pureiinsanity: @5up its sus if you have AP Mid tho also that enemy team oh god no
[2:36:35] coolwaveofcalm: There we go all fixed
[2:37:04] 9fierce9: A nidalee jungle is a pick
[2:37:41] hgsmallz: what tech am I witnessing
[2:37:44] hgsmallz: what the fuck
[2:38:14] friendlyestdirt: this is either gonna be the greatest online bonding experience of all time or this is gonna suck
[2:38:21] hgsmallz: Ant if he ever tells you to play this you need to leave call immediately
[2:38:22] 9fierce9: This poor lulu is going to through this horrible laning phase om
[2:38:49] pureiinsanity: ^
[2:38:50] FrozenLavaReflector: You can explain it utility AP vayne
[2:39:06] FrozenLavaReflector: Thats not how max health bonus magic damage works
[2:39:11] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector its not that simple
[2:39:21] FrozenLavaReflector: MR helps.... just not as well
[2:39:26] pureiinsanity: the lulu kinda needs to know that all the damage is based off of her
[2:40:11] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector MR is actually really good i think into this esp if mid is also magic
[2:40:16] pureiinsanity: you get to double dip
[2:41:04] pureiinsanity: like all of 5up's team's damage is gonna be magic if camile forces aatrox in a split
[2:41:14] 9fierce9: Honestly the amount of trust this Lulu puts in you, is commendable
[2:42:33] friendlyestdirt: I think they’re just being polite, but in reality they hate you

[2:43:57] Enma_o: I feel pain watching this laning phase lol
[2:44:25] pureiinsanity: 5upCry

[2:46:22] 24finns: Thanks!!
[2:46:49] pureiinsanity: @ewwii_damncat he's half gone
[2:47:00] balletbunny: @ewwii_damncat they couldn’t queue together anymore because of riot glitch so theyre playing solo
[2:47:06] friendlyestdirt: what is happening? this is actually such great teamwork
[2:47:18] friendlyestdirt: nooo

[3:00:55] Dathrelian: mhm
[3:01:02] pureiinsanity: yeah non premadeless its sus
[3:01:22] pureiinsanity: maybe force them to play Ivern
[3:01:26] pureiinsanity: cuz then its harder to fuck up
[3:01:33] CalvinDeuz: i dont think we win that combat though
[3:01:43] Dathrelian: you could win as ivern easily
[3:01:54] Diablo_19: hello 5ups
[3:01:58] pureiinsanity: Hwei is the biggest problem
[3:02:12] pureiinsanity: OMG yes tell us how it went yesterday
[3:02:13] hgsmallz: how far behind the state of the game can you be for renata lulu to be okay
[3:03:03] pureiinsanity: actual 3shot poppy
[3:03:06] CalvinDeuz: ok thats crazy
[3:03:08] Dathrelian: no peel
[3:03:51] 9fierce9: 5 actual hits to kill that tanky of a poppy as a support character should be illegal
[3:04:10] lazyxbum: dam that's alot of damage
[3:04:32] cameron416: i was gonna ask how it's been going but i see quite a few renata wins there
[3:05:14] pureiinsanity: lmao
[3:05:17] pureiinsanity: you manhandled him
[3:05:22] cherryita_: hello streamer 5upWave
[3:05:46] pureiinsanity: @5up The problem is you are cursed on stream apparently
[3:06:19] lazyxbum: wow that lulu really know when to shield, bunny, and ulti
[3:06:34] cameron416: ur fed out of ur mind
[3:06:49] AkitaAttribute: It's not even that expensive of a build
[3:07:33] maverickx29: It requires faith in the lol community to soloq it. And i think thats just asking 2 much
[3:08:00] lazyxbum: her passive makes her like kogmog but with some cc to get away
[3:08:26] cameron416: as long as you can get like lulu ivern or milio and they arent mental gapped immeditaely
[3:08:37] ewwii_damncat: do you like lulu more than ivern after all?
[3:08:38] FrozenLavaReflector: Well now you would understand... but no one else will
[3:08:54] cameron416: she's hella reliant on a nice frontline tho if ur not chain stomping them
[3:09:41] lazyxbum: that lulu looks like a mid-main
[3:09:52] balletbunny: riot explain
[3:10:01] FrozenLavaReflector: It was a glitch or your MMR is trully fucked
[3:10:27] FrozenLavaReflector: Like to the point where riot cant unfuck ypur MMR
[3:10:42] 9fierce9: Whats ants peak?
[3:11:13] FrozenLavaReflector: Dont worry, my 8 game loss streak today did not help me
[3:11:39] lazyxbum: you get mix, higher/lower/same than your mmr if there isn't enough people in quene
[3:11:48] 9fierce9: Thats surprising, thought ant was higher, his gameplay reflect higher
[3:12:48] 9fierce9: Dusting off the Zilean letsgo
[3:12:55] FrozenLavaReflector: 5up, im pretty sure your entire champion pool outside of matbe chogath gets fucked by blitz

[8:42:02] Joker_GGEZ: i cant believe that was lost
[8:42:04] Beemittens: :)
[8:42:14] Vyxalli: Lol seraphine and sona both wasted ult
[8:42:16] beato_ch: cant believe jayce got away with that
[8:42:21] Joker_GGEZ: seems i have a lot of learning left to do still for league i thought that was a won game
[8:42:33] ExistentialLamp: sona decided that she should flash into the bush rather than over the wall towards her team
[8:42:33] beato_ch: she should have flash ulted the jayce or something
[8:42:49] Halofan642: @Joker_GGEZ it was but then it wasnt
[8:43:04] Joker_GGEZ: pain
[8:43:06] TopJayce: hwei looks like a bad champ if youre that fed and carry
[8:43:19] TopJayce: cant carry*
[8:43:20] 9fierce9: Thats twice someone survives your final blow becauseof level up within the weak
[8:43:33] Halofan642: its bait
[8:43:34] TopJayce: no im not saying you did bad
[8:43:41] Halofan642: that cant be serious human being thought process
[8:44:01] Joker_GGEZ: oh thats the opp
[8:44:11] TopJayce: Shen kept ulting the xin
[8:44:17] TopJayce: the only tank on your team getting shen ult
[8:44:24] beato_ch: honestly if sona groups dont we win the 4v5?
[8:44:47] Joker_GGEZ: wait didnt you tweet stream's not ending until you hit masters
[8:45:06] beato_ch: WHY DID SHE MOVE AWAYBHELPPP
[8:45:40] TopJayce: I mean the pros is she got vlad off you guys, vlad was the most useful one on our team
[8:45:48] TopJayce: but yeah bad play on her
[8:46:36] Quaigon_Twitch: just dont chase after scuffed kill
[8:46:46] Quaigon_Twitch: is also a way to win here
[8:47:08] beato_ch: the moment sona split it was lost ngl
[8:47:40] TopJayce: no objs, grugs op
[8:47:46] divax0x0: Good morning
[8:47:57] 9fierce9: Especially with an inting briar
[8:48:04] TopJayce: its op
[8:48:05] beato_ch: yea he was busy chasing the sona LOL
[8:48:11] TopJayce: it is
[8:48:16] Halofan642: nice man
[8:48:22] Halofan642: his response is "its fuckin op bruhhhh"
[8:48:23] TopJayce: look at how much lethality it gives
[8:48:35] TopJayce: yeah and you get armor pen
[8:48:40] TopJayce: its like 40 lethality
[8:48:50] TopJayce: if shen is rushing armor
[8:48:51] Halofan642: WUI8Hdwaruio9hfasueoifdsa
[8:48:56] TopJayce: eclipse has no dmg
[8:49:13] TopJayce: every time ive built it, it does 1k dmg at most
[8:49:16] TopJayce: in 30 min games
[8:49:17] Halofan642: its probably just otp brain
[8:49:31] TopJayce: Yeah and i dont trade, i poke
[8:49:37] TopJayce: hence why i go full lethality
[8:49:37] Halofan642: veigarv2 brought up one time that otps have the worst builds cause they get bored of their champ so they spice it up just to spice it up
[8:49:42] Joker_GGEZ: gn gl on the rest of the climb sir you got this i believe
[8:49:49] TopJayce: 6 abiltiies, 2 of which do dmg
[8:49:54] Halofan642: good night joker
[8:50:01] divax0x0: @joker_ggez night
[8:50:34] TopJayce: Q Q. W melee is bad dmg, E is no dmg unless maxed, W ranged is bad until maxed as well
[8:50:49] TopJayce: yes but it has to be maxed
[8:51:07] TopJayce: lvl 1 e only does 5%
[8:51:12] Halofan642: hes an otp in low diamond
[8:51:13] Halofan642: ...
[8:51:16] beato_ch: i mean jayce changes a lot
[8:51:18] TopJayce: yes thats why i maxed it last game second
[8:51:29] Halofan642: level 1 it does 8% enemy max hp pre resistances + 100% bonus ad
[8:51:38] TopJayce: low diamond? ahahaha, i have 3 accounts in masters
[8:51:46] hughjanus9001: hxei!!
[8:52:05] Halofan642: are u thinking of fullmetal jayce
[8:52:17] TopJayce: eh everyones different
[8:52:21] Halofan642: fullmetal jayce plays low masters sometimes on smurfs
[8:52:23] Halofan642: taht guys so funny man
[8:52:28] TopJayce: I always tell people play jayce the way its comfortable for you
[8:52:55] TopJayce: Try it in practice tool ig
[8:52:55] Halofan642: that doesnt even make sense
[8:53:00] TopJayce: and compare the dmg output
[8:53:01] Halofan642: u should play ur champions the best way they can be played
[8:53:32] cakebird: 5up? on league? wild /s
[8:53:32] TopJayce: say that to pink ward
[8:53:37] neverwaken4: Since eclipse is about to be nerfed soon, I suppose it’s worth trying different things first
[8:53:38] coolwaveofcalm: It's crazy the conversations that have happened from enemies in chat and how different they have been
[8:54:03] TopJayce: and thebausffs
[8:54:07] Halofan642: i dont think ive lost to pink ward
[8:54:16] Halofan642: i just stay in the minion wave and that guy loses lane every time its so funny
[8:54:26] Halofan642: his mind explodes i swear to god
[8:54:35] 9fierce9: Cough Cough, Kayn players most of the time PepeLaugh
[8:55:18] TopJayce: I also go dirk before going it
[8:55:35] ExistentialLamp: its not right, but jayce decided instead of doing pitiful damage to shen, hed still do pitiful damage to shen but also do no damage to squishies until like 3 itms
[8:55:52] beato_ch: ff
[8:55:55] TopJayce: So i get dirk, grudge, = 25 lethality +24% armor pen. Shen builds Sunfire/Tabie = 120ish armor = 50ish lethality
[8:55:59] TopJayce: thats the math behind it
[8:56:05] Halofan642: UFDAUHIAFDSSFD
[8:56:10] erinkuma: LOL
[8:56:46] coolwaveofcalm: damn
[8:56:54] TopJayce: @ExistentialLamp I never even team fight that game so you wouldnt know the dmg i did to squishies lol
[8:56:54] Halofan642: what is this song
