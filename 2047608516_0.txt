[0:38:04] Oglino: YOOO
[0:38:05] Oglino: ah
[0:38:11] Fr0stWulf: wtf did jhin just do to you?
[0:38:20] Skurai21: Starving Artist RP on point
[0:38:20] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[0:38:22] Fr0stWulf: he looked at you and you exploded
[0:38:40] Colgaldy: @thatluckyloser IIRC Hwei is Jhin's 4th target for serial killing? IDK if that's right though
[0:39:00] DraygoDraygon: No, Jhin killed everyone where Hwei lived
[0:39:10] Broke99: @thatluckyloser Jhin killed everyone he loved
[0:39:19] Colgaldy: Ah, so Hwei is just the last one.
[0:39:21] Broke99: because he thought it would make Hwei's art splash a bit more
[0:39:23] thatluckyloser: just love new people 3head
[0:39:35] DraygoDraygon: Yeah he wanted Hwei to be "unrestricted"
[0:39:54] Broke99: Because they were both artists and hwei was like "This guy gets it!" and Jhin was like "This guy gets it!" and they had two very different meanings
[0:40:11] Oglino: AINTNOWAY
[0:40:20] DraygoDraygon: I AM glad Hwei isn't just another "insane artist" character though
[0:40:21] Fr0stWulf: what the cat doin
[0:40:30] DraygoDraygon: I actually like his character
[0:40:36] Broke99: @DraygoDraygon The emotes sell it the best its Ito and Miyazaki LOL
[0:40:45] DraygoDraygon: LUL
[0:40:46] thatluckyloser: hwei is a depressed artist
[0:40:47] Skurai21: Dominance asserted
[0:41:10] Broke99: @thatluckyloser Hwei's a depressed artist who paints the beauty he wants to see in the world using his depressive emotions
[0:41:28] DraygoDraygon: Hwei wants to improve the world with his art, both in terms of art and cuz of his ability
[0:41:29] thatluckyloser: and also is a burst mage part time
[0:41:57] DraygoDraygon: He sees the problems but rather than just be like "that be how it do" he's more "But..why can't we fix it"
[0:42:12] DraygoDraygon: So he's sad about how shit it can be but also determined to improve it
[0:42:17] DraygoDraygon: Cuz he sees how it COULD be
[0:42:19] thatluckyloser: okay he chill
[0:42:45] DraygoDraygon: He also feels guilt for unknowingly giving Jhin "motivation" to kill everyone
[0:42:45] Moobot: Broke is prepared to drag anyone into the Detroit Salt Mines, founded 1921™®. So chill and have a non-branded cola drink, on Broke.
[0:42:50] DraygoDraygon: Not at all
[0:43:04] DraygoDraygon: He wants to kill Jhin cuz Jhin is a fucked up serial killer LUL
[0:43:05] Oglino: danse
[0:43:10] thelonewanderer66: jhin killed his whole village
[0:43:11] Mag_Lev: Jhin basically broke the twink
[0:43:32] DraygoDraygon: Basically he complained to Jhin that his masters weren't letting him paint how he wanted/with all his ability
[0:43:32] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[0:43:42] DraygoDraygon: Jhin took it as "Oh, well then if I kill all the masters, there's no issue smile"
[0:43:50] thatluckyloser: that was close
[0:43:55] DraygoDraygon: Nicely done
[0:43:58] Broke99: but he can't kill jhin cause Jhin's an escape artist and also on government money
[0:44:01] SalemPulsifer: a quite decent trade, to be honest
[0:44:14] DraygoDraygon: He's sure as hell trying though
[0:44:14] SalemPulsifer: one tower, one kill and one objective
[0:44:16] SalemPulsifer: for 2 kills
[0:44:18] thatluckyloser: jhin's on government money? I thought he was on the run
[0:44:31] DraygoDraygon: He's being used by the government as an assassin
[0:44:35] Broke99: @thatluckyloser Let out of jail by shadowy ionian leaders to "Handle" the noxians
[0:44:45] DraygoDraygon: By a sect of the Ionians yeah
[0:44:50] DraygoDraygon: It is, its ability haste

[1:02:06] ALevel1Cleric: probably just hopping on rengar cuz hes strong rn
[1:02:06] Grognog: Most of the time you wont be punished. But if you do it into an invading jungler without knowing their starting position then you're asking to lose
[1:02:12] PinkRathian: you have to select em in the bottom left

[1:05:11] PoorMansPoison: hey so just borrowed an adhesive eyepatch from my brother, ama lawlmanHap
[1:05:25] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: He couldnt have lvl 3. but yeah going to red was the better play
[1:05:46] KotH_Scooby_Doo_Futurama: maybe he bought his account bro
[1:05:52] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: blue plus red isnt 3. But yeah that path was awful
[1:06:06] Skurai21: going wolves over raptors or red was really bad yeah
[1:06:13] Oitetment: Was he autofilled or does he normally play JG
[1:06:21] GebisGaming: @PoorMansPoison do you have a demon sealed away within the eye the eyepatch is covering? tink
[1:06:31] DraygoDraygon: The wubblies NOOO
[1:06:39] Oglino: AINTNOWAY 󠀀
[1:06:44] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: Jg just feels so bad to play now that there is an autofill in like 2/5 games imo
[1:07:01] DraygoDraygon: 6 Grubblies is a strong buff tho, could be kinda worth to prevent that
[1:07:07] PoorMansPoison: @PoorMansPoison no just an insanity inducing amount of discomfort, irritation, and mild pain every time I blink
[1:07:09] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: As a jg main, I get whey people just stopped. But i cant last hit for shit so i stay
[1:07:15] Skurai21: Graves died i guess?
[1:07:16] TheGrayPlains: No camps up i guess?
[1:07:19] Grognog: He just didnt pay attention to graves death
[1:07:21] GebisGaming: @DraygoDraygon yeah, but dying there isn't the play to stop 6 grubblies
[1:07:23] Grognog: I would assume
[1:07:29] GebisGaming: stop them at the next grub spawn
[1:07:30] JoePatzilla: rengar never knew where graves was
[1:07:33] Skurai21: hes kinda just wandering around now
[1:07:45] DraygoDraygon: @GebisGaming True
[1:07:49] Dizzonance: He's behind, and LOOK AT DARIUS HERE. Illaoi is so pushed in he should have just ganked top.
[1:07:50] Broke99: Grabbing one grub and just leaving the last two is a giga play
[1:08:00] Broke99: they can't get 5 and it never notifices them that one was taken
[1:08:03] TheGrayPlains: Also your top was pushed darius gets to respond...
[1:08:08] stankattack: so basically jungle was feeding?
[1:08:21] Oglino: stankattack yep
[1:08:40] Witch_Shaelyn: Major jungle dif
[1:08:42] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @stankattack Not feeding just making very bad calls early. And then hes too far behind to be of any help
[1:08:45] Skurai21: idk why you would even play rengar hes on the harder side of junglers
[1:08:55] vigil_umbra: verypogg
[1:08:55] GebisGaming: honestly its insane how jg used to be my second best role and now it's my worst
[1:08:55] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[1:09:09] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @Skurai21 They just checked the top jglrs right now in google probably
[1:09:12] GebisGaming: cause like, at least with ADC I can play some APC's which are much more my speed
[1:09:19] GebisGaming: but jg has gotten so bonkers that I've given up
[1:09:21] Grognog: He's strong, but if you get behind... oof. Get behind against a bully jungle that can farm hard? BIG OOF
[1:09:27] Skurai21: you know what you are probably right
[1:09:36] vigil_umbra: @GebisGaming jd death. it's inevitable
[1:10:10] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: The exp and dmg nerfs to camps is killing the role. Its quickly becoming worse support
[1:10:37] Broke99: Nah jg's just in a funky new learning phase is all
[1:10:52] Broke99: Every single season they completely change jungle
[1:10:54] Broke99: same as always
[1:11:15] Eburi87: Jungle and Support are all I can play because I can't gauge last hits for shit peepoSad
[1:11:20] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @Broke99 But it felt bad LAST season. when they nerfed the xp rate and increased camp dmg
[1:11:31] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: Now it feels even worse bc of the map changes
[1:11:40] Broke99: Jg was giga op last year

[1:20:01] Denzelliott: was she bad before or just mid?
[1:20:05] DraygoDraygon: Mid
[1:20:09] Eburi87: I'mma going off topic, but god I hope EDF6 has a different weapon system than EDF5. I have no shame in saying I'm cheating to have a bunch of weapons drop at the end of a mission instead of having to grind a mission on a difficulty I've already done just for stars fudgeLurk
[1:20:13] Fr0stWulf: Dizzonance knowing how riot balances this is probably true
[1:20:29] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @Denzelliott She was FINE before. Idk why they buffed her to hell
[1:20:31] Broke99: Riots mentality for changing things is buff everything then look at the statistics after a few patches
[1:20:37] DraygoDraygon: I like the star system in THEORY Eburi87 but yeah its not great that like, the baseline of each weapon is awful

[1:25:08] DraygoDraygon: @Eburi87 Yeah I did the same with 4.1 LUL but I unno, I found myself replaying 5 more anyway so I ended up not having to except for armor value

[2:41:19] Koinman25: the episode they had in the old Justice League cartoon was fun
[2:41:25] Don_Savik: but they always fuckup the suicide squad, they should NOT be ones to go after the justice league.
[2:41:36] MCManon: the harley queen Bird of pray movie was good, but I don't think it count as a suicide sqad

[2:43:03] zaleves: Not sure I've ever played a good DC comics based game though LUL
[2:43:12] Coyote_MD: Unless they fixed, it, people can't even play the 3 day early access because the game just auto-completed on start
[2:43:14] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @zaleves The arkham games are FIRE
[2:43:14] thatluckyloser: I liked the arkham series
[2:43:14] Skoto: my guess is it's gonna end up like SE avengers game, live service bs that shuts down after a year
[2:43:18] KillerCrocomire: I wanna ask this question to everyone: who FUCKING ASKED for a suicide squad game
[2:43:18] Fr0stWulf: im pretty sure they gave review copies out just not to ign which is a good thing imo
