[1:21:49] doodlerancher: underwelming
[1:22:02] VintagePlaysTV: yeah seems like they just wanted to give everyone a little more dps.

[1:26:10] swordtut: well a gnomes on both
[1:26:16] VintagePlaysTV: horde and alliance can get same mounts?
[1:26:31] doodlerancher: are we getting discounted for this mount?
[1:26:47] wolfsark: and you can opt out of it which is nice too if you just want xp
[1:26:49] DragonsofZoam: banned 😝😝
[1:26:57] pleasuremaster69: what’s up guys!
[1:26:59] doodlerancher: lets fuckin go
[1:27:03] LRGee: Agnosticism is the view or belief that the existence of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable.[1][2][3] Another definition provided is the view that "human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist."[2]

[1:27:37] doodlerancher: i dont understand how thats possible
[1:27:41] VintagePlaysTV: no more trading gold while in a raid?
[1:27:42] trekkin: Think they just gonna start live banning after they form groups LUL
[1:27:56] Jhova91: can someone explain what gdkp is lol
[1:28:00] pleasuremaster69: happy to be here!!!
[1:28:07] Avery_Nice_Guy: @Jhova91 pay gold to buy raid gear
[1:28:16] Renfuryy: gdkp transactions will just exist outside of the game, which is worse
[1:28:22] ricky_lake: kinda like gdkp tho ngl
[1:28:22] trekkin: Gold dragon kill points = using ur gold to buy gear
[1:28:25] VintagePlaysTV: people bid gold for raid items
[1:28:26] Renfuryy: but really gdkp isnt needed in sod, the content is too easy
[1:28:29] Jhova91: ez ty @Avery_Nice_Guy
[1:28:31] DragonsofZoam: dkp is points you get for killing raid bosses
[1:28:36] brian152012: !desi
[1:28:38] wolfsark: dont think this will stop all GDKPs but will have an impact for ssure
[1:28:50] Zefior: @Renfuryy exactly what i said, SAME MIND 5Head peepoHug
[1:28:53] DragonsofZoam: you spend dkp on raid gear
[1:29:02] Renfuryy: @Renfuryy keking
[1:29:04] Avery_Nice_Guy: @Jhova91 ya you bid gold to win the gear and the gold is split between the raid at the end
[1:29:06] pleasuremaster69: yo vintageplaystv what the fuck are you talking about
[1:29:08] wolfsark: GDKP is alright but it causes too much RMT and gold buying
[1:29:08] brian152012: you got me killed in Ragnaros lol i was paying attention to you while fighting him lol
[1:29:17] LRGee: gdkp is not guenuine gameplay
[1:29:22] DragonsofZoam: GDkp is gold “dragon kill points”
[1:29:40] LRGee: if you are too bored or bad to play, go play retail xD
[1:29:44] Zefior: oh i agree im just saying people always find a way to ruin their own game experience xffshrug not blizzard's fault
[1:29:49] pleasuremaster69: Vintageplaystv Desiheat does not respect you
[1:30:02] hauserdot: good news
[1:30:13] conflictonn: fuegoRave fuegoRave fuegoRave
[1:30:17] trekkin: I will say that the amount of rampant GDKPS in WOTLK and watching the player base die after they started up in Ulduar is probably why they are trying to stem the bleeding now

[1:40:01] Arriv003: @DragonsofZoam exactly. Merit systems usually revolved around gearing up one tank vs anyone else. Then that tank would decide to quit and whole guild progress stops.
