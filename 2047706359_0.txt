[1:35:15] avuloseunda: @lilymichaelship_ i hate him so much. I didn't like him before because of the awful yordle sex jokes. Then i saw a clip of him having a bad day and his mom came on stream to advice him to take a few minutes break breath and game. He instantly flamed her back I'm like wtf
[1:35:17] Holdtight1: 1.4m
[1:35:18] Yanshuu: @LilyMichaelShip_ MODS

[1:36:33] NadiaBusiness: also i didn't know i had DMs disabled for the longest time
[1:36:40] 아이엠더피치: shaco thinks u paid the yone
[1:36:44] octovine: wonder what all current streamers will be up to in 20+ years in their middle age
[1:36:47] Captain_TheRealOne: Yeah yeah just curious
[1:36:48] Shemsuh0: @Captain_TheRealOne in general. Once you reach a certain "escape velocity" it's permanent.
[1:36:49] aggttv: sumit?
[1:37:01] LilyMichaelShip_: how long will u stream for pekin like age wise
[1:37:04] unethikeele: im gonna purposely forget about faker just to prove you wrong!!!!!!!
[1:37:06] Shemsuh0: You never "go back." Even if you become less popular, you're still famous.
[1:37:08] batmanelol: I don’t agree with that
[1:37:09] Foslight_: Yeah like everyboy know the Beatles

[1:37:25] batmanelol: a following yes, but it’s not the same as it was before
[1:37:25] hewhocomz: drake x 2
[1:37:25] octovine: @Foslight_ never heard of them Kappa
[1:37:27] LilyMichaelShip_: PEKW
[1:37:28] pallasfr: drake
[1:37:30] Megamixr: @PekinWoof i think you are off teh money about streamers because 99% of you guys are talentless hacks who only made it because you were edgy
[1:37:31] DjogoUnchained: bluds said kanye and eminem
[1:37:31] pallasfr: but hey
[1:37:32] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: only bcz most POP music was already trash

[3:18:49] snarfiedoo: I got banned from Joey's chat for talking about you Kappa
[3:18:51] obamaspawner: !zwag
[3:18:51] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[3:18:52] pyropenguin03: good take if it weren't tarzaned
[3:18:54] bronzebanana145: it was something small
