[3:41:29] josho_rising: I tried this matchup w/o tenacity rune and with difference if you get hit with his W is insane
[3:41:41] GeneralSniper: u dont need to tenacity lol
[3:41:46] GeneralSniper: shoud always go domination secondary
[3:41:49] GeneralSniper: unless vs all in
[3:41:53] josho_rising: no the tenacity shard rune
[3:41:54] spookz2: he means rune i think
[3:41:57] josho_rising: ye
[3:42:00] sudo1v9: y
[3:42:07] josho_rising: its more useful than hp in this matchup when I played it
[3:42:26] sudo1v9: yep enemy has rylai brand+ janna too
[3:43:03] josho_rising: on rumble hp rune usually better cause sheild scaling but into matchups like jax ksante i like tenacity shard

[3:47:05] josho_rising: @Blaylock like a good yone maybe but that champ's that champ
[3:47:26] saaba123: i could probably do it with aatrox on bronze

[3:51:39] maciozka: U have right but playing vs rumble..
[3:52:44] feerACTUAL: they told me you could only AP top when you had counter cuz tanks just build that stupid new item and you can't play the game
[3:52:58] saaba123: @maciozka its not easy especially when u arae melle nit i see right now, thats a solid kill, he abused of rumble overstepping, but he hitted his skills, and he played calmly

[4:02:32] Blaylock: Why voidstaff over the other one?
[4:02:35] saaba123: thats a big draven
[4:02:41] GeneralSniper: wow ad gap is crazy
[4:02:51] josho_rising: @Blaylock other one only 30% pen and its passive is useless
[4:02:57] josho_rising: and rumble doesn't need ability haste
[4:02:58] Blaylock: useless?
[4:02:58] iamyourleader: ad gap is very large this szn
[4:03:03] iamyourleader: void is maximized damage
[4:03:07] iamyourleader: and they have a 2 mr item ksanta
[4:03:25] saaba123: @Blaylock apparently void synergize really well with liandrys

[4:03:45] ColaSniffer: void staff is a very bad item
[4:04:08] josho_rising: you guys are high its 40% pen it'll always be a good item
[4:04:24] Blaylock: Feel they're very similar items, trading raw 10% damage over 10haste+team healing
[4:04:25] AustinLUX7: yo i gave you a follow when T1 picked you in twich rivals years ago and you balled. nice coming back and seeing you on 100t and balling. keep it up bro
[4:04:43] josho_rising: @Blaylock it makes a difference
[4:05:27] ColaSniffer: void staff cant deal with tanks.. they get 200 magic rest.. after void staff they still have 120 mr
[4:05:42] josho_rising: @ColaSniffer after rumble they have 80 mr
[4:05:48] josho_rising: rumble e shreds MR guys
[4:05:54] josho_rising: stacking pen on rumble is op
[4:06:08] saaba123: @ColaSniffer thats exactly why u build void staff on rumble, he reduces their MR
[4:06:16] josho_rising: ^^
[4:06:48] ColaSniffer: void staff does nothing vs the 1000 magic dmg shield item
[4:07:06] josho_rising: would you rather fight the item with a void staff or without?
[4:07:07] josho_rising: like?
[4:07:08] josho_rising: lmao
[4:07:17] saaba123: @ColaSniffer now try without
[4:07:19] josho_rising: twitch chatters
[4:07:30] Blaylock: Well he would either need void or the other 30% mag pen item... I was more just wondering why he chose void over the other one
[4:07:33] Blaylock: Neither is a bad item
[4:07:43] josho_rising: the other item is pretty bad
[4:07:45] feerACTUAL: void has 10 percent more pen
[4:07:46] ColaSniffer: void staff is a must have bad item,, thats how i see it.
[4:07:57] saaba123: there is not a single mage that doesnt benefit from MP especially in the current meta
[4:08:10] josho_rising: @saaba123 preach saaba

[4:08:43] josho_rising: le draven auto attack
[4:08:49] josho_rising: he doesn't even have IE yet?
[4:08:51] josho_rising: yikes
[4:09:32] josho_rising: you like zhonyas before rabbadons here or you need more damage?
[4:09:43] saaba123: @ColaSniffer now thats a little bit more reasonable, but still not correct, the price and the lack of functionality is not ideal indeed, but with the current mage itens is worth taking the hit on having a extra passive and a 3rd stat for the 40 MP, that is huge
[4:10:34] josho_rising: also if we're just talking rumble he does not synergize with that item well because he's usually too far away for the heal or if rumble does get low enough the heals useful he's prob already dead
[4:10:48] saaba123: @josho_rising zhonyas over rabadon always i believe, especially against talon brand
[4:10:54] josho_rising: and again the e shred and pen being inherently stronger on rumble than most champs
[4:11:12] feerACTUAL: it heals your whole team, and its a pretty fat heal.  I'd still go void here, though.
[4:11:47] saaba123: i like the new magic pen item, but not for pure damage dealers
[4:11:51] saaba123: i like on ahri
[4:12:29] Blaylock: Seems good on a lot of mages tbh, unless your sole job is kill 1 person on enemy team with your combo imo
[4:12:32] saaba123: statwise is pretty bad tho
[4:12:32] josho_rising: i could see it being good on ahri
[4:12:40] josho_rising: anyone who uses ability haste better than rumble
[4:13:30] josho_rising: AH is borderline wasted stat on the rumbler
