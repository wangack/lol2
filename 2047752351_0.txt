[2:22:00] hartlessvessl: honestly it one of the only things that disprove evolution, cause why have we not evolved with everyone having perfect eye sight

[2:23:14] hartlessvessl: there is laser eye sugery which i hear is good, but also can be bad and cause permanent eye dryness
[2:23:22] MeagerClown: @thanahtos i assume she means "High functioning" like mine is

[2:24:35] hartlessvessl: low functioning autists are really bad, like rainman
[2:24:36] MeagerClown: @gamergirl no no no, you do not have low functioning. low functioning is like autistic screaming and severrely disabled. high functioning is like us where we can go to the store and grab a bottle of milk lol
