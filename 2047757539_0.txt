[0:27:35] arshg13: oh travis leaked it
[0:27:37] arshg13: i see
[0:27:42] womboboys: Markz's fault
[0:27:45] bobbyhill49: should ask mark
[0:27:45] arshg13: well if my confirmation matters its confirmed!
[0:27:47] profitguru: Cubby that mug is dope
[0:27:49] dropsofliquid: Any chance no road show saved some jobs or it‚Äôs unrelated
[0:27:54] Cielandria: No spring show possible?! Sadge.
[0:27:58] SwedeBeGoode: Depose Markz
[0:28:00] TheAlphaMatt: I can't believe they saw how poorly that went for LEC last year and decided to do it here too
[0:28:13] arshg13: yea but theres a reason they havent announced it it's not like they planned to have it this late
[0:28:15] nocturnavi: Do we know why?
[0:28:22] eviltrenton: -+
[0:28:22] profitguru: @dropsofliquid if anything it's taking away jobs with needing road crew
[0:28:26] arshg13: not just about good/bad pr @cubby
[0:28:35] Ikancast: @nocturnavi money probably
[0:28:42] GlassEyeTiger: StoryMob needs something good to work with
[0:28:43] eviltrenton: "these layoffs are not financial in nature"
[0:28:56] dropsofliquid: @profitguru those are probably temp workers though right? I doubt they have permanent road crews
[0:29:05] WopaPlays: wasnt it on Easter last year?
[0:29:06] arshg13: (at least afaik) its more about a diff part of the layoffs stuff not that
[0:29:11] profitguru: Hopefully Summer Finals will be in Toronto since Riot still hasn't made up for taking away the World's stop
[0:29:23] dropsofliquid: @arshg13 thx
[0:29:23] TheAlphaMatt: This is such a bummer
[0:29:31] Jeankof: welp n ot counting on managing on scoring 1 of the 200 seats for finals, especially once you count the seats taken by staff and such
[0:29:37] 1twenty3: it really sucked for LEC last year
[0:29:39] stanaqours: @WopaPlays yes and its on easter again this year lol
[0:29:46] cubdave: spring is over easter isn't it?  seems bad to have a road show
[0:29:46] littleindianman12: @Jeankof Isnt LCS 300 seats?
[0:29:54] Jeankof: idk it might be
[0:29:54] Connor_Leebs: I just wish there was a way for more in person LCS across the country man dang
[0:29:55] WopaPlays: ya for that reason... i do not care tbqh
[0:29:57] ImmortalScrub: Talking about all the great content LCS has been putting out could be a topic of discussion that isn't massively depressing to talk about lol

[0:30:22] jvrvilela: "You are the best!" Travis said, as he slipped his feminine hand into Markz's pants and smirked. "Are you trying to mate me?" protests Mark, as Travis blushes, the boyish figure undressed before Mark. "Weak tempo play, Travis." The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Mark places his needlessly large rod into Travis open item slot.
[0:30:23] TheAlphaMatt: Oh no, I thought this was gonna be a positive announcement

[0:31:21] SarahDeeGee: If they had originally planned a road show, it definitely wasn't planned for the last weekend of March before they went to 8 weeks. And getting a venue on 6 months notice would be both tough and expensive.
[0:31:26] profitguru: Yo Trav how much to sponsor a one-off episode?
[0:31:33] Nazhjin: smile that it happened, dont cry that its over

[0:36:13] bondance: imagine Travis is sponsored by NRG or Immortals and he had to take back all the cruel words he's spoken
[0:36:14] SwedeBeGoode: Blaber and Travis buddy comedy please
[0:36:14] DaniGrim: If they sponsor TGI, I may consider buying a Kia this year
[0:36:15] Mortryx: LUL Û†ÄÄ
[0:36:16] Gorx9797: Dang so do I still buy the R16 or is there a better pre built desktop. Anyone got an opinion now that Alienware isn't a sponsor lol

[0:36:31] jvrvilela: "You're the best!" Travis said, as he slipped his feminine hand into Markz's pants and smirked. "Are you trying to mate me?" protests Mark, as Travis blushes, the boyish figure undressed before Mark. "Weak tempo play, Travis." The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Mark places his needlessly large rod into Travis open item slot!

[0:37:38] dropsofliquid: Olleh also said he instalocked Mundo without team permission & that‚Äôs the wildest thing I‚Äôve ever heard üòÇ
[0:37:41] saint734: only one tricks in NA solo queue LOL
[0:37:49] ur_a_rock: They also jokingly implied that NA pros are lazy :)
[0:37:50] urgotabekidding: Pros such a novel concept that's never been done before ;)
[0:37:51] SwedeBeGoode: Cubby plant call
[0:37:57] yanya7701: LPL even have coach tryouts
[0:37:58] nizzy2k11: their tryouts are basically loads of inhouses, some teams have done this before too.
[0:37:58] kamikazplatypus: okay so like we CANT do tryouts because of the timing of offseason half the time, like if you want to sign a player for LCS that is on an LCS team that team needs to give permission which they dont have an incentive to do since they arent paying for buyouts and stuff anymore
[0:38:01] HexBlast: Academy teams are better for finding coordinated players
[0:38:02] WopaPlays: @dropsofliquid imagine your teammate doing that lmao
[0:38:09] Ian7j2: WATCH PROS EMILY IS THE GOAT
[0:38:13] ixbx: the totally original, never before done. Pros segment is such a good addition the the league ecosystem :)
[0:38:16] Bearus_Aurelius: they also said that Korean and China don't do tryouts anymore haha

[0:38:29] pfwangers: pc cafes are overrated in korea if you dont have a korean account
[0:38:31] saint734: @kamikazplatypus tryouts are for solo queue/amateur pick ups not other players lol
[0:38:34] SwedeBeGoode: @ixbx you cheeky bugger
[0:38:35] kamikazplatypus: LCK orgs have like 3-5 rosters of players and can pay most of them absolute peanuts
[0:38:38] PogoStomp: Most teams don't have development teams to put players that they try out.
[0:38:40] yanya7701: @bearus_aurelius I dont know about Korea but China still do
[0:38:50] kamikazplatypus: LCS teams cant even have a 2nd roster for player development so uh, its kinda brutal out here

[0:39:35] arshg13: he also said that this wouldnt work in NA and isnt necessary anymore lol
[0:39:38] yanya7701: @nizzy2k11 no tryouts should also apply to old accomplished players not just rookies
[0:39:39] nizzy2k11: @profitguru do you mean LCS?
[0:39:49] saint734: Berserker said he never even saw the main team while he was a trainee on T1

[0:40:12] PogoStomp: Advantage that Korea has is that people under 18 still play LoL
[0:40:21] dropsofliquid: @ur_a_rock fair fair. I did watch. Super fun content haha
[0:40:22] travisgafford: don't want to interrupt the show right now but will shout it out and it is super appreciated, especially right now
[0:40:25] ur_a_rock: @ixbx youre the goat
[0:40:25] vp_z: korea infrastructure is very condensed as well
[0:40:32] SwedeBeGoode: @travisgafford subport
[0:40:33] profitguru: @nizzy2k11 I mean LCK. They used to do tryouts before the challengers/academy/whatever it's called system was in place in Korea. Now they just have people go through their tier 2/3 teams to develop them
[0:40:44] nizzy2k11: seoul is like 20% of the total SK population too
[0:40:46] dropsofliquid: hahahahahaha
[0:40:47] wejustplayed: LOL

[0:40:51] kamikazplatypus: HMM I THINK MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP A BIT FELLAS
[0:40:52] HaveFunDave: Travis Gafford is the interview goat
[0:40:55] Yomuwu: Hmmmm
[0:40:56] DaniGrim: Novel idea
[0:40:59] Nazhjin: i wonder if secondary teams in korea cost $400k a year
[0:41:04] dropsofliquid: I think TL & FLY would participate for sure
[0:41:09] saint734: BRING ACADEMY TO THE EAST COAST
[0:41:12] DaniGrim: You should pitch it to the new commissioner.
[0:41:19] Ian7j2: Too soon Travis
[0:41:27] DaniGrim: Markal Zimmerman
[0:41:29] Ian7j2: Lolol
[0:41:35] saint734: EAST COAST MINIMUM WAGE IS 7.25; I CAN RUN AN ACADEMY TEAM OUT OF A NEW YORK RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENT
[0:41:39] kamikazplatypus: we could legit put players in Kansas city on google fiber 10gb up 10gb down, for like half the price of doing this in LA AND they'd have like sub 20 ping to the live server
[0:41:47] bii_bella: @travisgafford if I gift a sub right now, can it count towards a pack after stream?
[0:41:52] nizzy2k11: @profitguru yeah but they do that to find players for those lower teams
[0:41:53] NoxParagon: Actual facts
[0:41:56] travisgafford: yes @bii_bella lol
[0:41:59] treethan__: @kamikazplatypus and freeze thine butt off
[0:42:04] urgotabekidding: T2 league in Kansas!
[0:42:05] SploogeShot: they also get housed and fed in korea no?
[0:42:07] Lyghtsaber: trainees don't need to live off it though? get a job
[0:42:07] kamikazplatypus: @treethan__ the price of progress
[0:42:11] arshg13: what cubby is saying is that california should strive for the korean economy
[0:42:14] saint734: @kamikazplatypus if LCS was in ohio we'd have like a bunch of midwestern mechanical gods
[0:42:16] Ikancast: the combines were fun
[0:42:16] NoxParagon: The issue is that LCS is still in LA for no reason, they shouldve moved to the east coast years ago
[0:42:18] nizzy2k11: @kamikazplatypus chicago metro area aint that expensive.
[0:42:19] numiiigoesrawrz: FLY did one
[0:42:25] treethan__: @kamikazplatypus If Taylor Swift can handle KC so can you!
[0:42:30] kamikazplatypus: TRUE!
[0:42:45] bii_bella: bii_bella is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to travisgafford's community! They've gifted a total of 8 in the channel! 
[0:42:46] bii_bella: bii_bella gifted a Tier 1 sub to zerovisible! 
[0:42:48] saint734: @Lyghtsaber did most NA pros even finish highschool
[0:42:48] yanya7701: @NoxParagon thats bc Riot is in LA
[0:43:04] profitguru: @nizzy2k11 If we can't have LCS teams keep a challengers team what would they be scouting spots for?
[0:43:16] Lyghtsaber: @saint734 plenty of jobs don't need that
[0:43:31] kamikazplatypus: NACL teams can kinda do combines, but like at the LCS level with most teams not having a tier 2 team it just isnt gonna happen for the LCS level or by the LCS orgs themselves
[0:43:44] arshg13: BASED toast
[0:43:58] treethan__: @kamikazplatypus great point!
[0:44:01] treethan__: and insight
[0:44:09] saint734: @Lyghtsaber the challenger/amateur turnover needs to be higher; to prevent like perma-grifters from just chilling in tier two
[0:44:16] Ikancast: perkz might be available soon
[0:44:24] WopaPlays: @Ikancast god no
[0:44:24] treethan__: @Ikancast dead
[0:44:26] kamikazplatypus: whats insane is the teams CAN test out the meech's of the world in our offseason, but you really cant test the KR imports, and yet people are just going for the imports they havent seen before
[0:44:29] nizzy2k11: so we bring the NA teams to kroea!
[0:44:30] imainleesin: @Ikancast LUL
[0:45:16] saint734: if you aren't in the LCS by like 23, and 2 years in the amateur scene, you should probably go back to college in NA and teams should give someone else a shot
[0:45:22] daisydupe23: kekw
[0:45:38] arshg13: this is like the best two people to have for this call lmao
[0:45:48] numiiigoesrawrz: quad üíö
[0:45:48] kamikazplatypus: yeah and the reason it doesnt happen in LCS is long term teams at worlds just cant because of how late it runs, and the remaining teams have a limited pool of players they have access to just because they wont have access to half the players because their current teams are trying to keep them around etc.
[0:45:57] nizzy2k11: @saint734 if you can still make money and enjoy playing, you don't need to go to school until you're ready.
[0:46:00] Lyghtsaber: @Ikancast good one. good one. dude was done after 2020

[0:49:04] arshg13: meech has been shockingly good lol
[0:49:07] kamikazplatypus: like 100T wouldnt have done what they did roster-wise had they not scaled back their spending and honestly this roster is much more compelling than the previous iterations of similar teams to me at least
[0:49:09] portilho: @OG_Plumwick no im just a viewer
[0:49:11] arshg13: eyla must be smurfing

[0:51:42] razlol: @fountaiin69 LUL
[0:51:48] treethan__: @razlol bro what did I do to deserve this
[0:51:55] saint734: @razlol average flyquest hater
[0:51:57] nizzy2k11: whats his ping?
[0:51:58] kamikazplatypus: chiCAHgo
[0:51:58] PogoStomp: @renmaidar fakegod, Zeyzal not count?
[0:51:58] treethan__: Also Raz watch my bronze malphite baron steal
[0:52:04] Sillyshadow: Sillyshadow subscribed with Prime. 
[0:52:05] HippoSquirrel: chicago represent!
[0:52:06] Ikancast: LUL
[0:52:12] Dethrey: lol
[0:52:15] a_large_farvaaaa: raz needs to save some of the handsome for the rest of us
[0:52:16] GodzillaGuerilla: oh my god we're surrounded by bears
[0:52:22] dragosi_gaming: Rockford?
[0:52:26] aceofspades3018: travis I think you should be more like the LCS and Pause the show for 30mins like 10 times!
[0:52:35] Avvura: Jim Gaffigan PogBones
[0:52:35] leagueofemily: i feel like anyone around a major city does that
[0:52:38] Dethrey: xD
[0:52:44] leagueofemily: I'm from "Boston" but actually outside of the city
[0:52:49] womboboys: Dekalb nerds thinking they're from Chicago
[0:53:01] razlol: @treethan__ gigachad malph
[0:53:02] starlitspirit: chicagoans are surprisingly salty when folks from the suburbs say they're from the city lol
[0:53:02] renmaidar: @PogoStomp Fakegod and Zeyzal would count the same way Bwipo/Olleh would count
[0:53:05] Pita26: @leagueofemily much easier than trying to explain where we're actually from
[0:53:10] leagueofemily: yea for sure
[0:53:18] treethan__: @razlol rock solid. always.
[0:53:21] arshg13: @leagueofemily same i just say sf but im from the bay
[0:53:24] arshg13: LEC did not have 1 observer
[0:53:28] HexBlast: Is there a take here?
[0:53:30] arshg13: this weekend
[0:53:34] Lyghtsaber: @leagueofemily of course, it's easier than explaining where/what suburb city name we're actually from/
[0:53:36] CSiers: sotlHang
[0:53:38] Nazhjin: as a previous team owner, REN was pushed HARD and holy hell did I not expect it to ever launch lmao
[0:53:39] I_Saika: Lec had less pause after layoff xdd
[0:53:47] Ian7j2: I had no idea it existed
[0:53:48] dropsofliquid: wait what‚Äôs the thing they are cancelling?
[0:53:49] arshg13: @Nazhjin yeah of course LOL
[0:53:51] Ikancast: i wonder id the one observer left also does their valorant observing. the main EU valorant observer is one of the best in the industry, although if hes being worked extra without compensation that does suck
[0:53:54] pfwangers: getting rid of the streaming service is the right decision
[0:54:01] arshg13: @dropsofliquid it was a short lived riot only esports streaming network
[0:54:03] nocturnavi: Sideshow had a good video on this topic
[0:54:04] renmaidar: John Needham had talked about it before, and Montecristo had leaked it before
[0:54:07] iEnigmaaa: just wanna say that despite the layoffs and some obvious issues, LEC and LCS talent did exceptionally well
[0:54:19] dropsofliquid: @arshg13 üôè thx
[0:54:20] saint734: @Nazhjin lcs franchise owners sold y'all a crazy bridge
[0:54:30] iEnigmaaa: so well done to all the talent that work on LEC/LCS and RIP to all the laid off workers <3
[0:54:33] WopaPlays: it just sounds massively unprofitable
[0:54:37] Nazhjin: think of REN as like watching football with live stat trackers etc
[0:54:42] trollinn69: that sounds like a VC pipe dream that definitely deserves to be cut lmao
[0:54:43] Nazhjin: except everyone watches LCS on twitch
[0:55:00] CSiers: ResidentSleeper
[0:55:03] nizzy2k11: so proview? that failed the first time.
[0:55:03] kamikazplatypus: think of all the times riot tried to make or work on a PLATFORM level deal.  MLB Bam was a DISASTER
[0:55:04] aceofspades3018: right before the end of the call you should pause for 30mins. and say you had a ping spike or something because you lost a team fight
[0:55:04] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[0:55:05] treethan__: Hey now. I watch it on lolesports for those fake drops
[0:55:11] leagueofemily: BAMTECH
[0:55:11] Ian7j2: Oh is this what he meant by like revamping lol esports!?
[0:55:13] nizzy2k11: MLB
[0:55:13] iEnigmaaa: CoolStoryBob
[0:55:14] lazink: just give the LCS to the owners and take a % of the revenew, letting the owners pay for everything by selling the media rights to someone
[0:55:14] Ian7j2: The website
[0:55:16] kamikazplatypus: THEY DONT KNOW ABOUT BAMTECH
[0:55:18] WopaPlays: like have we seen lolesports, did we think that was going to go well
[0:55:19] the1andonlycorbin: HUH
[0:55:23] HippoSquirrel: I def remember bamtech
[0:55:24] kamikazplatypus: that was our golden goose and riot FUMBLED THE BAG
[0:55:24] womboboys: MLB BatChest
[0:55:26] director_donut: director_donut subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:55:27] HexBlast: MLB bamtech
[0:55:28] pfwangers: @nizzy2k11 no, its a seperate platform
[0:55:30] arshg13: bamtech is what ren originally was right
[0:55:30] fountaiin69: boomer-story time
[0:55:33] saint734: @trollinn69 lol they pitched this to some 27 yr old wharton kid with too much trust money
[0:55:34] CSiers: oh lord we got to the bamtech part of the broadcast
[0:55:39] arshg13: or something like that?
[0:55:44] treethan__: truly a trade magazine now
[0:55:49] treethan__: this is it fellas
[0:55:55] nizzy2k11: @pfwangers right, but how would the product be different. it doesn't make sense.
[0:55:55] kamikazplatypus: bamtech was a giant platform kind of like a twitch
[0:56:02] treethan__: Travis is evolving into trade magazine right before our eyes
[0:56:03] Ikancast: luckily apple tv stepped in
[0:56:04] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus did you guys.. use it?
[0:56:13] arshg13: ah ok i see
[0:56:19] Meekout: Meekout subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[0:56:19] arshg13: so this was in like the old days
[0:56:19] kamikazplatypus: it never saw the light of day, and travis is likely gonna spill the tea on why that is its VERY DUMB
[0:56:32] 504cesar: k
[0:56:41] pfwangers: @nizzy2k11 it would be an internal product, so more control over product features, but probably not enough of a difference which is why it was killed
[0:56:48] trollinn69: 350m holy shit
[0:57:03] jigglyduffy: this play not working out was such a massive blow to the franchise dream Riot pitched
[0:57:06] Dethrey: woah
[0:57:18] arshg13: if they did this i would've never watched LCS lol
[0:57:19] fountaiin69: @leagueofemily Emily you are my favorite analyst and you are much smarter and more entertaining than Raz
[0:57:19] Ian7j2: Wait holy shit what
[0:57:19] razlol: thats MAX to you
[0:57:20] Dethrey: was it the tech that controls DIsney+ now? hmm hmm
[0:57:27] razlol: @fountaiin69 true
[0:57:27] Nazhjin: bamtech was supposed to basically cover all LCS MG payements and some too
[0:57:30] arshg13: @razlol smh deadnaming MAX
[0:57:50] leagueofemily: @razlol untrue
[0:57:51] saint734: @leagueofemily did you ask mask/castle to go on pros, or was olleh just who volunteered
[0:57:57] razlol: @razlol your untrue is untrue

[0:58:08] kamikazplatypus: ive heard just a mountain of rumors about all the reasons why it went down and at this point i dont even know anymore how it died, but in the hindsight its INSANE that it didnt pan out because it would have legit saved the league LOL
[0:58:09] arshg13: @razlol one of you is getting frogged rn
[0:58:10] leagueofemily: @saint734 I requested all three players specifically
[0:58:15] nizzy2k11: so wait, did disney kill the LCS?
[0:58:16] starlitspirit: @razlol let it be known I am frigging you even though I cannot send the frog in twitch chat
[0:58:20] PogoStomp: yeah overwatch beat them to it
[0:58:24] leagueofemily: @razlol Raz I will fight you
[0:58:41] Hypernova749: pog emily rand
[0:58:43] arshg13: @leagueofemily for some point down the line, castle is potentially a top 3 personality in the LCS right now dude is loveable as hell
[0:58:46] razlol: @razlol im not afraid of fighting women!
[0:58:49] arshg13: heavy recommend for PROS
[0:59:02] arshg13: @razlol ur canceled raz
[0:59:07] kamikazplatypus: fellas who cares if we dont get a deal with twitch or youtube we've got REN!
[0:59:10] Lyghtsaber: good ole corpo can kicking
[0:59:18] trollinn69: ren sounds like the worlds biggest money pit
[0:59:29] leagueofemily: @arshg13 Oh yeah I love Castle, want to get him in more content
[0:59:34] a_large_farvaaaa: who‚Äôd be the last one standing in a casters / analysts royal rumble @razlol
[0:59:36] y0ungsterjoeyttv: rip raz career after that one
[0:59:43] saint734: @travisgafford was REN mentioned during the "Move to Weekday" pitch to the LCS owners
[0:59:46] CSiers: @arshg13 more castle enjoyers!!!
[0:59:58] saint734: the friend is steve for sure
[0:59:58] razlol: @a_large_farvaaaa Medic
[0:59:59] kerokerogrips: @nizzy2k11 Messages highlighting players , monetized avatars, and other integrations , based off what i answered from a riot survey sent to me through the game client
[1:00:00] arshg13: @leagueofemily we talked about oppenheimer for maybe 4 of my total 10 minutes with him
[1:00:01] leagueofemily: @a_large_farvaaaa Medic

[1:00:06] Fredthefree: REN is to capture monetization in China
[1:00:10] kamikazplatypus: its especially hilarious since twitch streaming to like 10k people for 8 hours at 1080p costs twitch legit like 4k+ USD just for that 1 stream
[1:00:10] Lyghtsaber: @razlol 1v1 emily on broadcast
[1:00:16] leagueofemily: Medic would kick all of our asses
[1:00:22] WopaPlays: good guy twitch burning money already for riot
[1:00:23] a_large_farvaaaa: Lol
[1:00:23] womboboys: The Client is perfect
[1:00:24] kamikazplatypus: so why put that cost on yourself? you'd have to monetize it SO EFFECIENTLY
[1:00:25] razlol: @razlol pick a time and place @leagueofemily
[1:00:29] treethan__: Emily would destroy Raz
[1:00:30] Cloud9: the opps are watching travis
[1:00:31] Cloud9: watch out
[1:00:32] nocturnavi: theoretically it was supposed to help with monetization no? Like Riot could sell adds or in game content better if they had all the user data
[1:00:36] Ian7j2: So was lol esports website gonna be Ren????
[1:00:38] arshg13: but wouldnt everyone team up to take down medic first? @leagueofemily
[1:00:39] razlol: @treethan__ hold on now
[1:00:40] treethan__: Like team Emily for sure here
[1:00:43] leagueofemily: @razlol LCS parking lot, next week :3
[1:00:44] treethan__: Raz def iron
[1:00:51] Lyghtsaber: @Cloud9 when are they not
[1:00:59] arshg13: please pick a time im tryna get video of this
[1:01:20] kamikazplatypus: like omg LOOK AT THE LOLESPORTS WEBSITE, its never been updated and is constantly lagging behind in updates and functionality for a DECADE at this point
[1:01:21] nizzy2k11: @leagueofemily get this on broadcast i beg you.
[1:01:22] saint734: @leagueofemily can raz and emily kick off the pro vs pro 1v1
[1:01:32] Fredthefree: Riot has always had a lackadaisical culture, not lazy just everyone got to work at their own pace
[1:01:37] treethan__: @kamikazplatypus As a drop enjoyer its painful each time
[1:01:46] travisgafford: @Cloud9 !??!!
[1:01:56] arshg13: whats this guy's source that LCS had broadcast team layoffs
[1:02:00] saint734: Shopify should have taken their 8 mill and ran LOL
[1:02:19] kamikazplatypus: @arshg13 its public, many on the team have tweeted about them being effected by layoffs
[1:02:29] nizzy2k11: it makes no sense to make a free streaming platform when twitch/youtube exist.
[1:02:46] BottleGnomes: gone (in NA)
[1:02:55] treethan__: @BottleGnomes false
[1:02:59] treethan__: LCK teams complain too
[1:03:06] travisgafford: @kamikazplatypus sotlThinking
[1:03:07] saint734: Riot's too busy enjoying the profits from Esports marketing to care about if LCS is profitable lol
[1:03:08] treethan__: besides T1 they sent a letter iirc
[1:03:10] nizzy2k11: @BottleGnomes financhally the esport is doing poorly everywhere.
[1:03:22] travisgafford: true jon
[1:03:24] travisgafford: or john
[1:03:26] travisgafford: I don't know which
[1:03:30] treethan__: More international tournaments
[1:03:30] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus lcs had way less than lec, and it wasnt as much on the broadcast team side, i was just pointing out he got lec and lcs confused
[1:03:31] womboboys: The sport is too over extended.
[1:03:37] arshg13: there were engineers tho so i guess taht actually does count
[1:03:38] trollinn69: they ran out of startup money
[1:03:45] travisgafford: @arshg13 source on this?
[1:03:45] Lyghtsaber: fight me but league culture died after relegations/promotions were cut. after that it was just corpo bs
[1:03:49] WopaPlays: small indie company
[1:03:56] j_tripper: overwhelming majority of startups don‚Äôt get off of the ground with that philosophy though
[1:03:58] kamikazplatypus: @arshg13 yeah i mean thats fair, the LEC was MASSIVELY effected compared to LCS they were like a skelton crew
[1:04:09] Fredthefree: REN would monetize China
[1:04:14] arshg13: @travisgafford i can dm you but i literally just talked to a bunch of lcs and lec people about layoffs and took several pages of notes
[1:04:15] trollinn69: Disney plus is bleeding money like nothing else
[1:04:28] numiiigoesrawrz: jonathon join the show üòµ
[1:04:31] nizzy2k11: @Fredthefree tencent owns a streaming service in china.
[1:04:32] numiiigoesrawrz: might as well
[1:04:37] trollinn69: every streaming service is so in the red
[1:04:40] kamikazplatypus: i mean im down im kinda just chillin
[1:04:44] brosciencegym: where is MARK z
[1:04:48] Nazhjin: it was an attempted at linear programming
[1:04:49] womboboys: There's no way you have Arcane on your own thing over Netflix
[1:04:56] saint734: @travisgafford was REN talked about in the power presentation for the lcs weekday move?
[1:04:56] arshg13: @nizzy2k11 really? thats cool actually
[1:05:01] PogoStomp: remake the good old days of cable tv....
[1:05:03] leagueofemily: We're going to be the ESPN of Esports
[1:05:03] treethan__: @kamikazplatypus perfect idea for Kansa City LCS commish
[1:05:05] arshg13: preach!
[1:05:23] trollinn69: now Disney is gonna sell espn to the NFL üòÇ
[1:05:27] arshg13: @leagueofemily please no i like ur fits dont just wear suits every day
[1:05:32] Nazhjin: REN was literally broadcasts with additional items for fans like stats, cams, proview, etc - source: me who got showed it
[1:05:33] rudetortoise: @trollinn69 netflix earnings are doing well
[1:05:35] kamikazplatypus: CAN WE STOP COPYING SPORTS AAAAAAAAA, anyone who deals with NBA localized cable blackouts and other programming blocks knows that the whole reason our viewership is as high as it is in esports is bceause everyone watches for free, if we try and gatekeep it our numbers will be WAY less impressive
[1:05:37] nizzy2k11: @arshg13 they're one of the largest media companies in the world. their westers site is called touvo
[1:05:49] patchesfaces: whats the current topic?
[1:05:49] lazink: @trollinn69 ESPN is the most profitable division of Disney
[1:05:51] jigglyduffy: Discoverability and grabbing new audiences would be a lot harder in a walled garden
[1:05:52] financeconsultant: financeconsultant subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:05:52] Ikancast: mls season pass on apple this year was a really big step for following the league. they still need to do some work on discoverability and UI, but the streams themselves were great
[1:05:54] Dethrey: it would be legendary if its free but also premium features
[1:05:59] treethan__: @kamikazplatypus sorry man I want my life to be r/nba
[1:05:59] arshg13: disney + LCS
[1:06:02] leagueofemily: @kamikazplatypus it also just...doesn't work because we don't sell broadcast rights
[1:06:02] Lyghtsaber: but is the cost of all that original stuff worth just putting in the other places? bet no one stopped to ask that...
[1:06:16] bii_bella: can we just have cable again and have THE REN channel pls
[1:06:21] nizzy2k11: video streaming is the last thing you wanna spend money on.
[1:06:31] saint734: @Ikancast yeah but pro sports has blackouts + media rights, while esports has no blackouts + free to watch
[1:06:35] renmaidar: Honestly I think it would've been a great idea, since there would've proview and stats and stuff like those chinese platforms
[1:06:36] kamikazplatypus: @leagueofemily yeah and thats kinda why right, like we know that folks wont all pay 10 bucks a month to watch LCS and stuff like that, we kinda saw that with proview
[1:06:40] leagueofemily: shared revenue from broadcast rights is what keeps team owners unified (among other things but that's a big one)
[1:06:52] Dethrey: yeah have an area where fans can sub to LCS and get all the team icons you know
[1:06:53] Natibe_: The streaming platforms aren't even profitable for the big companies. It would 100% have been a dead loss for riot who doesn't have nearly enough exclusive ip to support it.
[1:06:55] KikisDeli: kangas did a great job this weekend
[1:06:58] leagueofemily: see: nutting in MLB (not sexual)
[1:07:04] numiiigoesrawrz: yeah esports director clerkie talked about it
[1:07:05] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus do u think proview couldve been succesful if remodeled? for internationals only maybe?
[1:07:11] arshg13: @leagueofemily what.
[1:07:11] a_large_farvaaaa: too sexual
[1:07:11] Lyghtsaber: @leagueofemily islandNutnut
[1:07:14] nizzy2k11: the LCS just sucks up tons of peoples prime makeing all the streamers miss out.
[1:07:19] Ikancast: @saint734 yeah and i usually get streams from free sites, but the cost for the season pass was around $25 by the time messi got in and the quality of it was the best ive ever seen for sports
[1:07:20] treethan__: damn with the pin
[1:07:21] Dethrey: good idea actually
[1:07:27] deekomode: HUH
[1:07:27] leagueofemily: @kamikazplatypus yea i'm sad about proview though because i think it had a greater roi than monetary value BUT i feel that way about so many things lmao
[1:07:34] lazink: @leagueofemily it's also the fact that the owners are the true OWNERS or the sports league, not some single entity
[1:07:35] saint734: @Natibe_ lol riot never planned on this being a thing; they sold these dudes a bridge for years
[1:07:36] Nazhjin: @leagueofemily and lack of delivering on partnership revenue keeps owners divided :)
[1:07:37] WopaPlays: the pin ICANT
[1:07:39] kawallaa: are costreamers paying for their cost teaming rights? Riot will never monetize their broadcast.
[1:07:42] MacDaAce: MacDaAce subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:07:48] numiiigoesrawrz: thank you for your sub @MacDaAce
[1:07:53] cubdave: wut in the mlb SUS
[1:07:55] kamikazplatypus: @arshg13 nope, same reason why twitch is doing layoffs, operating the feeds is expensive since its a LOT of data to process through and stream out, if you can have it live on youtube/twitch and make them pay then maybe its feasible but it would devour their bottom line if riot had to charge enough to pay for the feeds upkeep costs
[1:07:59] nizzy2k11: @kawallaa no. they just have to be a good boy.
[1:08:00] arshg13: we should be paying caedrel like 2,000 dollars a day to costream LCS
[1:08:01] a_large_farvaaaa: can you expand on nutting in mlb
[1:08:01] arshg13: at LEAST
[1:08:11] MacDaAce: @numiiigoesrawrz thank you for all you do!
[1:08:14] CSiers: the owl twitch integration was so good
[1:08:16] renmaidar: @saint734 I mean it did exist, in a skeleton form at the very least
[1:08:19] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus you can paywall streams on youtube now, but youtube would take a cut of rev
[1:08:28] urgotabekidding: twitch has turned in to a camsite lite to maintain profits
[1:08:36] Myps: peepoSad
[1:08:38] saint734: @Nazhjin i mean i imagine some teams are straight suffering while others are monopolizing all the screen time + fans
[1:08:56] Ian7j2: I lost büòî
[1:08:57] leagueofemily: @a_large_farvaaaa too long to do in twitch chat but there are a few articles about it out there if you search, it's basically smaller team owners skimming money off the top to line their pockets when their teams suck
[1:09:07] leagueofemily: that's not the entirety of it but
[1:09:10] Nazhjin: @saint734 every teams viewership is weighted to the big guys so thats irrelevant. Riot's partnerships have more turnover than any other league to ever exist.
[1:09:14] KikisDeli: 1 sub = 1 month of proview
[1:09:15] Ikancast: the best things about lolesports is the runes and skill portions of the streams. i actually use that part quite often
[1:09:17] kamikazplatypus: Yeah there was a LOT of money on the table because folks wanted to do "perfect" not "good enough" which is really shitty given where we're at now
[1:09:19] sushidaddy04: sushidaddy04 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:09:27] MacDaAce: @leagueofemily <3 you are amazing !
[1:09:31] kawallaa: @nizzy2k11 I know. it was a joke. espn, prime, nbc pay for football/basketball rights. but costreamers keep all sub and ad revenue. the views are not worth the cost.
[1:09:32] bii_bella: @leagueofemily I was so excited about proview and was about to get it and then they immediately announced it was going away (it was around the same time I got into watching the lcs)
[1:09:34] Lyghtsaber: hot line league this year is actually HOTline league lets go
[1:09:36] Dethrey: truue
[1:09:41] a_large_farvaaaa: thanks. will read more about it
[1:09:41] leagueofemily: if you're wondering why a team owner of a team that's been historically bad would side with someone like...for an MLB example, the Dodgers for example, that's why, they're still making money for themselves
[1:09:43] womboboys: This topic doesn't even talk about sport longevity and how you make the game generational like any long standing cultural phenomena. Your infrastructure dies as people get older with no new players.
[1:09:43] kamikazplatypus: (MEANWHILE NACL HAS SUBS)
[1:09:48] saint734: @renmaidar any option to enhance pro media is always either limited or discontinued, like how much money did pro-view actually take to run LOL
[1:09:51] leagueofemily: @MacDaAce ty!
[1:09:51] PogoStomp: @urgotabekidding please explain how the cam girls are making twitch money since advertisers don't want to run on their channels and the girls are directing viewers to onlyfans not asking them to sub.
[1:10:11] Nightbot: If you have an active Amazon Prime Account you can link it to Twitch Prime & you'll be able to Subscribe to Travis for "Free" every month! These do not automatically re-sub, so remember to check if its available! More details here: https://twitch.amazon.com/prime
[1:10:16] 504cesar: @leagueofemily shout out to you!  You're amazing on everything you do with LCS
[1:10:17] TheRealMaliack: Riot blew it during Covid 2020 when there were no other sports and they could've advertised and got new people involved IMO
[1:10:26] urgotabekidding: @PogoStomp interaction with the site in general, drives overall viewership numbers up
[1:10:27] leagueofemily: @504cesar ty!
[1:10:28] Whoopley: remember folks to use your twitch prime to support the NACL :)
[1:10:33] kamikazplatypus: LMFAO
[1:10:37] kirocuto: @PogoStomp They get a big chunk of all those gift subs for one
[1:10:37] KikisDeli: @saint734 why would it be expensive though? where are the costs?
[1:10:41] Myps: too real, please stop
[1:10:43] MacDaAce: @leagueofemily TY for all the hard work! loved the color casting btw!
[1:10:47] gurg7: @Whoopley whoopl2NOTED
[1:10:53] renmaidar: @saint734 idk how china does it, but I know their platforms has it for some reason
[1:10:54] braydi__: lol
[1:11:01] KikisDeli: lol
[1:11:02] CSiers: turning the sub button on is what gets us to have esports in the client
[1:11:03] treethan__: lmaoooo
[1:11:04] kamikazplatypus: and then it hits the game team/dev teams and OOPS thats too much work and its dead sorry guys guess we cant do a sub button! @travisgafford

[1:11:12] treethan__: Needham in here taking notes
[1:11:13] Ian7j2: NOT THE CLIENT
[1:11:20] a_large_farvaaaa: also love the  videos moser and Emily are putting out on youtube
[1:11:21] arshg13: wait actually linking your twitch sub to lcs to league and getting rewards for it is a GOATED fucking idea
[1:11:23] saint734: @KikisDeli who knows LOL; the pros cams are recorded anyway; game vods from player povs should have been available since like S1; they still use player pov on broadcast LOL
[1:11:29] HippoSquirrel: Fuck Hasbro
[1:11:30] Cubbyxx: @a_large_farvaaaa +1
[1:11:33] womboboys: WOTC Pinkerton enjoyers
[1:11:37] lazink: @leagueofemily don't forget that the teams that make the most money have to share their profits with the teams that are in the red, to an extent, so there is no insentive for the teams losing money to do better, they are subsidised by the major market teams
[1:11:42] Lyghtsaber: riot inertia
[1:11:42] patchesfaces: WOTC hates their customers
[1:11:47] WopaPlays: WOTC mentioned, theyre at your door rn
[1:11:48] Yomuwu: Turn the sub button on Rito
[1:11:50] Lyghtsaber: fully just inertia at this point
[1:11:51] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:11:51] braydi__: Well Travis never experienced WOTC before Hasbro acquisition
[1:11:52] Ehllumination: Ehllumination subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:11:52] kamikazplatypus: PERFECT loses to good enough if you fail to execute on perfection and that distilled down is kinda the riot struggle for the LCS since its inception
[1:12:05] saint734: @lazink yeah but the rev share is never enough to make teams go in the green anyway LOL
[1:12:11] MacDaAce: Its all Marks fault
[1:12:12] trollinn69: it‚Äôs the east vs west coast business mindset lol
[1:12:17] Ian7j2: It's like balancing Zeri but with esports monetization
[1:12:25] Dethrey: so its too many riotgames executives are thinking short term not long term growth, oh snap
[1:12:26] treethan__: @Ian7j2 deadass
[1:12:28] saint734: if EG/GG were atleast in the Green the warriors + VC owners of EG wouldn't have shut down
[1:12:33] braydi__: So was Riot before Tencent acquisition the start-up, grassroots gaming company?
[1:12:47] MacDaAce: I miss GG low key
[1:12:50] Ian7j2: @treethan__ LEVERS
[1:12:56] lazink: @saint734 most the money comes from media rights
[1:13:05] TheRealMaliack: How do I subscribe with Prime? I don't seem to have the option?
[1:13:09] braydi__: I don't get why we're blaming Riot where Riot is just the organs of Tencent, it's parent company and those shareholders
[1:13:10] treethan__: @Ian7j2 Thats it ive seen enough. Phreak for riot ceo
[1:13:15] saint734: Riot refuses to impact the game on behalf of the teams besides world chromas LOL, so only the rich get richer
[1:13:20] Ikancast: that is one of the benefits i liked about each team having their own twitch stream, you got their specific emotes and whatnot
[1:13:27] coin1: such a wasted opportunity
[1:13:29] kamikazplatypus: think about how hard it is if you're a fan going to LCS to even buy your favourite team's merch LOL
[1:13:36] cubdave: all this sounds like people other than riot making money.  so no chance.
[1:13:45] leagueofemily: @kamikazplatypus true!
[1:13:49] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus its easy if your favorite team is fly or C9 tbf
[1:13:53] arshg13: (ur right)
[1:13:55] oldgegamer: Twitch won't build the shit esports needs
[1:13:57] MacDaAce: But hey, at least IMT has made content this year?
[1:14:10] bassnasty: completely agree @oldgegamer
[1:14:11] jigglyduffy: HOW BASIC IS IT TO HAVE A WEBSITE THAT HOSTS ALL ESPORTS CONTENT WORK??? looking at you lolesports
[1:14:12] kamikazplatypus: like why is it not stocked in the arcade, why is it on teams to like be the ones to do the legwork here, we're supposed to be working together and building fandom LOL
[1:14:15] nizzy2k11: wasn't there an LCS online store at some point?
[1:14:19] TheRealMaliack: @kamikazplatypus I agree completely - I have wanted to buy some LEC/LPL/LCK stuff and there's no easy way to get it in NA
[1:14:24] Cubbyxx: @kamikazplatypus YES
[1:14:29] Cubbyxx: I'D BE LIVID
[1:14:30] y0ungsterjoeyttv: I just bought my first jersey ever this weekend and all I had to Google was flyquest jersey. some brands make it work, others don‚Äôt *cough cough IMT*
[1:14:31] Bearus_Aurelius: it is beyond embarrassing the way Riot handles this stuff. It is baffling to an incredible degree.
[1:14:36] j_tripper: RIPbozo
[1:14:39] lazink: the major problem with the LCS and actually all the leagues is that Riot owns them, and not the owners of the teams
[1:14:50] kamikazplatypus: i swear if we just did all the little things "good enough" things would be in a WAY better place for the league
[1:14:57] Natibe_: I've really been struggling trying to get signed stuff from the C9 team, no road show means at best it'll be summer for me. It's crazy riot hasn't come up with a way to make stuff like that easier considering they always have these moon shot ideas.
[1:15:09] bassnasty: I mean we are lucky that Riot manage to make a good international system with individual leagues. But yeah some of this stuff is frustrating
[1:15:11] bobbyhill49: rip roadshow
[1:15:15] arshg13: did travis say "no roadshow"? like who said this
[1:15:25] GodzillaGuerilla: extremely common travis W
[1:15:29] Natibe_: Yeah he leaked it no spring road show
[1:15:29] MacDaAce: In Huston I asked lepoint jameson where my EG jersey was because they didnt even have them...

[1:16:52] kamikazplatypus: you're locked in now BUCKO! @Cubbyxx
[1:16:53] MacDaAce: Or if you stay after the show you can use your subs to force travis to open packs of MTG cards
[1:16:53] KikisDeli: classic
[1:16:56] app1ethief: D:
[1:16:57] Lyghtsaber: just give riot day rate ez pennies
[1:16:58] app1ethief: how dare he
[1:16:59] CSiers: mark left for a free kia
[1:17:11] patchesfaces: I heard that the reason why LCS isnt making money is cause they're paying mark 5 mill a year
[1:17:14] hide_on_her_bush: @Connor_Leebs  Ty for sub was afk
[1:17:20] kamikazplatypus: honestly meundies are kinda fire
[1:17:21] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus "BUCKO!" in all caps is so funny
[1:17:22] KikisDeli: ?
[1:17:26] kccaseyyy: LUL
[1:17:27] Natibe_: @arshg13 yeah that's what I'm saying. Road show isn't happening for spring it's staying in LA. i need them to be somewhere near michigan if imma manage to get the signed c9 merch and actually see a game in person for once
[1:17:31] Azikielboi: so ur saying i can buy u underwear @travisgafford ?
[1:17:37] i_play_viktor: how often do you shart?
[1:17:38] Lyghtsaber: alright let's get Steve talking
[1:17:40] WopaPlays: Travis you goin through a lot of underwear?
[1:17:45] 504cesar: HLLingerie
[1:17:51] kamikazplatypus: its legit GAME OF THRONES levels of intrigue
[1:17:53] AsheOfAx: Guys the LCS is great now, I got a bunch of friends to start watching and we've been having a great time with watchparties and screaming Bwipo's name whenever he's on screen
[1:17:57] MacDaAce: Get Bamboo underwear, you're welcome
[1:17:57] Nazhjin: non esports people doing esports things obviously
[1:17:58] arshg13: @Natibe_ ok, thats what i was trying to clarify. travis said "spring finals will be in LA" not "spring finals will be in studio"
[1:18:00] nizzy2k11: @travisgafford i will watch it travis
[1:18:03] jigglyduffy: ??? We talked about bamtech last week @kangascasts???
[1:18:08] bii_bella: hard agree @travisgafford that would be good
[1:18:25] trollinn69: lowkey would love esports business drama it sounds like a high school intro to business class
[1:18:26] Nazhjin: @Cubbyxx when are you me and jatt playing golf
[1:18:36] kangascasts: @jigglyduffy Yeah but we've talked about it a lot, refreshing hearing someone else bring it up
[1:18:39] Cubbyxx: Jatt makes tee times I'm down
[1:18:49] patchesfaces: 5 imports incoming
[1:18:50] MacDaAce: The community also votes to watch top every game... sooo
[1:18:52] kamikazplatypus: they have a korean mid laner in their academy team LOCKED AND LOADED!
[1:18:55] OG_Plumwick: ooooh
[1:18:57] penguinman250: huh
[1:18:58] arshg13: with who LOL
[1:19:01] numiiigoesrawrz: take: community sentiment around TL APA is not fantastic, TL will replace APA if he doesn't do well, but caller thinks CoreJJ should be moved on
[1:19:02] Ian7j2: Whoa
[1:19:03] littleindianman12: HUH
[1:19:04] Lyghtsaber: true
[1:19:04] n_p_breakit: L take

[1:19:07] j_tripper: nah
[1:19:08] Ian7j2: sotlHang sotlHang sotlHang sotlHang
[1:19:09] saint734: L take
[1:19:10] daisydupe23: saying corejj is the problem in that team is crazy
[1:19:10] cubdave: spicy
[1:19:10] SeverusSmoke: spicy spicy take
[1:19:11] arshg13: who can they replace APA with? and also holy shit banger LMFAO
[1:19:11] director_donut: I have the exact opposite take of people calling out APA, bro is surviving when every game every team throws everything at him
[1:19:12] dropsofliquid: I like TL right now it‚Äôs a fun team
[1:19:13] lionation: based
[1:19:13] renmaidar: He's right lol
[1:19:16] KSnOwnage: Core is making APA misplay.. LUL
[1:19:16] Lyghtsaber: yawn and snorejj ain't it
[1:19:17] saint734: I JUST SAW APA RUN IT DOWN LOL
[1:19:23] dropsofliquid: sotlScam sotlHang
[1:19:23] OG_Plumwick: core hasnt won without dl just saying
[1:19:23] Perchy99: Perchy99 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[1:19:24] patchesfaces: As a TL HAter i hope they replace CoreJJ
[1:19:28] Ian7j2: Cubby found a good one
[1:19:28] Nightbot: @SploogeShot -> Piece of cake. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[1:19:33] MacDaAce: Hmmm valid take actually
[1:19:34] WopaPlays: APA looks slightly better than Perkz
[1:19:34] Nazhjin: hot take, inero should replace dodo
[1:19:36] saint734: Megatron is the issue with the Detroit Lions @Cubbyxx
[1:19:38] WopaPlays: Core isnt goin
[1:19:43] wejustplayed: WOW what a take
[1:19:47] Ikancast: need the person from mean girls to tell him "stop trying to make lucian nami happen, its not going to happen!"
[1:19:47] kerokerogrips: coreJaja is as washed as perkz is rn
[1:19:52] ixbx: that call took a turn i was not expecting
[1:19:55] MacDaAce: But Core is so good for the scene
[1:20:01] dropsofliquid: CoreJJ is still great

[1:20:19] BeGentleBaka: BeGentleBaka subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! pog
[1:20:22] MacDaAce: Coach Core? <_<
[1:20:27] kamikazplatypus: I mean like look at their NACL roster, they have Roamer (Korean import who played in HLE Challenger) on the squad and since their LCS roster has an open import slot it seems like its pretty clear from a GMing pov what the backup plan is for if APA isnt performing
[1:20:31] renmaidar: idk why chat thinks this is so controversal isn't this the most obvious take? I thought it was widely agreed upon core is washed
[1:20:32] director_donut: I think its popular rn to hate on Core, but he does great things and makes mistakes just like every other player
[1:20:36] MacDaAce: 100%
[1:20:40] dropsofliquid: based Cubby
[1:20:40] saint734: Summit was right and caller is running it
[1:20:46] 504cesar: @MacDaAce that'd be pretty cool
[1:20:49] Nazhjin: APA champ pool too small
[1:20:58] Ian7j2: Give apa a full yr ffs
[1:20:59] leagueofemily: ngl i didn't realize that there was such a large TL backlash
[1:21:01] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus o fuck i legit forgot they still had their academy team LMFAO

[1:21:08] leagueofemily: we talked about this in MtR today though

[1:21:17] jigglyduffy: Umti is the best player rn
[1:21:17] Ian7j2: Impact?
[1:21:18] WopaPlays: Umti and Impact is it
[1:21:19] saltycurry8D: impact
[1:21:19] HannibalMontanaTTV: Yeon is playing well
[1:21:19] kccaseyyy: yeon
[1:21:22] arshg13: @leagueofemily i was arguing that until yesterday's game they were the worst performing team in the league
[1:21:24] MacDaAce: UmTi

[1:21:26] Mortryx: impact yeon
[1:21:30] Azikielboi: not impact or umti either
[1:21:32] Lyghtsaber: well it ain't yawn and snorejj
[1:21:35] dropsofliquid: Impact‚Äôs my favorite player I‚Äôm always gonna say he‚Äôs great haha
[1:21:35] Azikielboi: yeon is not playing well what is this
[1:21:37] KSnOwnage: Yeon has led in damage most of the games
[1:21:37] squid0333: APA
[1:21:39] director_donut: Lmao even Impact said he inted in the last game
[1:21:41] 504cesar: I want more games!
[1:21:43] MacDaAce: I think Yeon is just kinda ight Low key
[1:21:43] bondance: I feel like Apa is getting ganked every time he's on the screen
[1:21:44] Azikielboi: yeah as adc @KSnOwnage
[1:21:46] woodmoore: top lane is just udyr every game
[1:21:46] kccaseyyy: ?? didn't know people were sleeping on yeon
[1:21:52] Azikielboi: BatChest my adc has top damage
[1:21:53] kccaseyyy: yeon has been playing great
[1:21:55] daisydupe23: TL needs a mid carry and apa just not that kind of mid laner
[1:21:56] saint734: APA gonna look like deadweight when the play NRG again LOL

[1:22:00] KSnOwnage: @Azikielboi so you prefer he doesn't lead in damage? LUL
[1:22:07] scrapabidoopimpaff: impact has no impact in the game - he doesnt lose lane but he doesnt do anything. If they win its not bc of him and if they lose he's not trying
[1:22:12] OG_Plumwick: yeon lucian game was gross
[1:22:15] MacDaAce: I want Yeon to pop off
[1:22:21] saint734: APA gets more slack than literally any player I've ever seen
[1:22:24] Azikielboi: @KSnOwnage i mean its definitely not a bad thing, but it doesnt prove he is good
[1:22:25] WopaPlays: they need to stop drafting Lucian
[1:22:25] arshg13: man we're picking luc nami on new patch into karma why
[1:22:35] a_large_farvaaaa: tl should have picked up emenes so we get another manifesto
[1:22:35] saint734: I saw him rocket jump into an Azir
[1:22:53] sushidaddy04: Apa saw the resets there üòÇ
[1:22:55] KSnOwnage: @Azikielboi APA played Trist twice and didn't pump out the same damage
[1:22:57] WopaPlays: APA azir ults look like mine when I get azir in ARAM
[1:22:58] woodmoore: maybe he just shouldnt play tristana
[1:23:02] steph_curry_no1_fan: APA isn't even middle of the pack rn tho
[1:23:02] renmaidar: I'm just being honest corejj on Rakan needs to be added to the Geneva Convention
[1:23:06] arshg13: yeon and APA had more notable missteps than the other 3 players but
[1:23:16] patchesfaces: I'm an APA hater cause im a TL hater and he gets caught in the crossfire
[1:23:19] burnheals: I think people forget APA hasnt played that long
[1:23:19] saint734: solo killed by Palafox on Syndra at level 3
[1:23:21] Nazhjin: APA with new jg is cop out - hes outclassed in mid straight up
[1:23:24] smilediligently: i think he still hasnt beat the allegations that hes a 2 trick yet ( ziggs and tristana )
[1:23:27] Ian7j2: It's because he's vocal as a personality. You either love or hate him. Same with fudge
[1:23:28] MacDaAce: APA seems fine tbh same with Yeon, they just need to find their groove
[1:23:35] saltycurry8D: expectation is get an actual champ pool
[1:23:36] arshg13: but what's weird is that this team environment should be way better lol
[1:23:38] numiiigoesrawrz: !linktree
[1:23:38] Nightbot: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport
[1:23:43] CHD007: I mean so many players font get defended half as much as this APA guy lmao it's so weird
[1:23:48] KSnOwnage: @patchesfaces Imagine hating a 4th place team LUL
[1:23:52] ixbx: find the weakness and pressure it, solid game plan
[1:23:54] saint734: @smilediligently he actually plays a lot of champions like: candy cane ziggs, hextech ziggs, ...
[1:24:00] dropsofliquid: @patchesfaces tbh defending APA would likely get you more out of sync with TL fans. Tons of them are hardcore hating on him ü´†
[1:24:00] MacDaAce: I think TL is a solid 4th best RN
[1:24:15] director_donut: If teams are targeting APA, TL should be either in position to cover or be taking things elsewhere if so many resources are being sent mid
[1:24:16] smilediligently: @saint734 LOL u got a verbal laugh out of me good job
[1:24:16] j_tripper: unless you‚Äôre KC
[1:24:20] dropsofliquid: @macdaace perfect then üòé
[1:24:21] Ian7j2: We are a third into the split Travis
[1:24:22] saint734: @MacDaAce we literally lost to 100T
[1:24:25] sushidaddy04: Kangas makes a good point! APA has the yasuo effect.
[1:24:26] kamikazplatypus: hey fellas i know it sounds kinda crazy, but like what if we DIDNT flip our roster upside down because of bad Bo1 performance, could be neat!
[1:24:27] saltycurry8D: @saint734 armut of mid
[1:24:28] Ian7j2: LOL
[1:24:30] kerokerogrips: if only we had bo3's to better tell team strengths and weaknesses
[1:24:31] numiiigoesrawrz: !youtube
[1:24:32] Nightbot: https://www.youtube.com/@TravisGafford/videos
[1:24:47] karlheinzstockfootage: seems logical other teams would focus on apa or yeon.  you're not gonna bully impact or core or umti
[1:24:48] MacDaAce: @dropsofliquid yusssss =P
[1:24:51] KSnOwnage: @travisgafford this take would be better if we had Bo3 WubTF
[1:24:54] saint734: @saltycurry8D Armut has a world class Gnar; APA's Neeko might not even be LCS Playoff class
[1:24:57] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus after c9 lost to shopify im thinking that we need to sub out blaber. he's been around this whole time and c9 hasn't won worlds ONCE
[1:24:57] patchesfaces: @dropsofliquid new angle, APA is a god but TL's terrible development is holding him back
[1:25:03] Ikancast: @saint734 that 100T game was problematic about the shielding. either ashe needs to be rushing serpents fang or they need to pick a different draft where someone else can get it besides a jhin
[1:25:04] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:25:06] kamikazplatypus: sometimes if you have chronic underperformance with a variety of players there MAY BE BIGGER PROBLEMS TO SOLVE than the players in the seats and that goes for a lot of teams in the league honestly
[1:25:12] numiiigoesrawrz: !guest
[1:25:12] Nightbot: Kangas, a NACL / Academy caster :)
[1:25:17] woodmoore: @kamikazplatypus based
[1:25:30] negloid: good take. Core at his peak even in NA was insane
[1:25:31] patchesfaces: I hope that TL drops CoreJJ every time they replace one of their good players they always get worse
[1:25:31] MacDaAce: @saint734 Meh, i don't think 100T is bad though, I wasn't super surprised.
[1:25:35] saint734: @Ikancast or maybe APA shouldn't face check, lose his flash and then let himself die cross map 3 times before 16?
[1:25:37] dropsofliquid: @patchesfaces üòÇ please yes. APA needs supporters
[1:25:39] jigglyduffy: @numiiigoesrawrz can you add "bald" to kangas' description please? - his agent
[1:25:40] saltycurry8D: @saint734 lol yeah ik he lost on his main on day1
[1:25:56] daisydupe23: core doesn't solo lose the game like other players on that team
[1:25:57] negloid: his play has been dead avergae for 2 years now, His name is carrying him
[1:25:57] numiiigoesrawrz: @jigglyduffy kangas won't ocme back if i do that üò≠
[1:25:58] MacDaAce: I can see Core being the next Afro
[1:25:59] Ikancast: @saint734 thats true as well, but they win that game if ashe has the serpents instead of going heal cut + umbral
[1:26:07] saint734: If APA were an rookie import we'd be calling for him to be benched since week 1
[1:26:15] FranzLeague: @negloid true
[1:26:20] coin1: oh noo LUL
[1:26:28] brandywineriver: In-game coaching is huge tho...
[1:26:32] jigglyduffy: @numiiigoesrawrz we do it to him every week and he comes back anyway. I believe in you.
[1:26:33] dropsofliquid: @saint734 but he‚Äôs not & that matters lol
[1:26:35] Lyghtsaber: even bengi did that
[1:26:38] saint734: Only if they fire Dodo; I'll take that trade
[1:26:40] MacDaAce: Keeping Core in the scene in anyway possible is important to LCS and NA
[1:26:41] brandywineriver: shotcalling, they call it
[1:27:07] saltycurry8D: u cant replace core there are barely any decent supports in NA.
[1:27:14] woodmoore: remember when core played bot with imaqtpie
[1:27:16] MacDaAce: Core is NA league of legends
[1:27:19] saint734: Steve confirming Dodo getting rehired on HLL was top 10 worst moments in 2023
[1:27:29] renmaidar: @daisydupe23 I mean he almost solo lost that immortals game by using all abilities on a Ksante and ultimate on absolutely nothing
[1:27:47] Ikancast: it almost feels like theres too many different ideas in the team
[1:27:56] renmaidar: I feel like no body watches the games and only looks at kda after the game
[1:27:57] smilediligently: @saint734 FACTS if he was an import this call would be INCREDDIBLYYYYY different i agree with that statement 100%
[1:28:13] MacDaAce: What if you gave Core a ADC on his level and lets see what we think
[1:28:15] BottleGnomes: how many splits of middle-of-the-pack finishes do you start calling that a ceiling
[1:28:28] saint734: @smilediligently Is APA any better than Blue or Eika when they played last Spring iirc?
[1:28:41] karlheinzstockfootage: btw you don't think jensen & bwipo weren't kinda motivated after sitting out splits in the fly/tl game?
[1:28:47] steph_curry_no1_fan: they only made worlds cause pyosik played like jungle jesus
[1:28:58] arshg13: TL has not smashed  asingle early game this split
[1:28:59] lionation: SNL will never be fresh until Keenan leaves the show. Same idea
[1:29:02] Ikancast: if core plays hwei instead of nami then i will give him another chance
[1:29:02] saint734: TL made worlds because Pyosik literally carried LOL
[1:29:06] ImmortalScrub: This take is reliant on the idea that Core is forcing the team to play a specific way late game which is crazy
[1:29:07] arshg13: they barely had any mid game leads to throw
[1:29:11] desemaia: i agree, core is not the same player. time for new identity
[1:29:12] patchesfaces: CoreJJ is mega overrated
[1:29:16] MacDaAce: Give the man an ADC he doesn't have to babysit
[1:29:19] kerokerogrips: trymbi ?
[1:29:20] jigglyduffy: Replace CoreJJ with Kangas
[1:29:21] i_play_viktor: keria
[1:29:23] womboboys: How do fans decide what is "past peak"? LUL
[1:29:23] smilediligently: @saint734 i think hes worse cause hes only played 2 of the easier champs at a low tier lcs level
[1:29:27] boba_bunbun: rekkles kekw
[1:29:30] KSnOwnage: @patchesfaces alright dude, we get it. You hate TL
[1:29:31] arshg13: trymbi BASED
[1:29:32] kamikazplatypus: okay like, we GOTTA stop calling for heads if we dont have a new player locked and ready to come in, we cant just solve our problems by kicking players LOL
[1:29:35] MacDaAce: Only Vulcan could replace Core
[1:29:38] Lyghtsaber: the answer is obviously a boomerang import
[1:29:38] brandywineriver: Zven
[1:29:40] Ikancast: biofrost gmdBioThinking
[1:29:41] Avvura: Core isn't TL's issue, its their roster flipping/decisions
[1:29:42] MacDaAce: or Huhi
[1:29:43] renmaidar: Chime/Trymbi
[1:29:45] dropsofliquid: Kidnap Huhi
[1:29:47] TheAlphaMatt: Chime
[1:29:48] saint734: @smilediligently waiting for the APA Akali/Ori now that there's no language barrier
[1:29:52] woodmoore: rekkless literally speaks korean
[1:29:53] arshg13: duoking1 or dardoch @Cubbyxx
[1:30:01] KSnOwnage: Dardoch support
[1:30:03] daisydupe23: TL should get lck up incoming rookie Keria
[1:30:05] KSnOwnage: new player
[1:30:15] sushidaddy04: Swordart for 6 mil
[1:30:17] arshg13: jake?

[1:30:31] smilediligently: @saint734 LOL
[1:30:33] arshg13: chime is very good but idk if his style would work with yeon
[1:30:34] MacDaAce: I will do it, I've played support before
[1:30:38] patchesfaces: If TL does kick corejj they'll probably just spend another 12 million dollers on another korean import
[1:30:39] woodmoore: @woodmoore yeah haha im just trolling
[1:30:55] MacDaAce: Support is so easy tho
[1:30:58] 504cesar: @Cubbyxx been watching some Challengers.  Been fun so far
[1:31:01] saint734: @patchesfaces if TL kicks CoreJJ we should be relegated

[1:31:22] patchesfaces: @saint734 Don't threaten me with a good time
[1:31:26] steph_curry_no1_fan: he isnt good enough tho
[1:31:26] dropsofliquid: Steve hasn‚Äôt done that before though?
[1:31:33] daisydupe23: blaming TL loss on core is crazy
[1:31:45] WopaPlays: if the argument is that Core should go before APA its just a bad argument

[1:32:27] KSnOwnage: LUL
[1:32:28] renmaidar: I seriously don't get why people think Core is still good lol I swear people don't watch games and close their eyes whenever core uses abilities on absolutely nothing
[1:32:30] kamikazplatypus: C9 started with HyperX back when i was with them LMAO
[1:32:32] nizzy2k11: did anyones twitch partnerships lapse?
[1:32:35] arshg13: alienware still with TL then?

[1:35:00] steph_curry_no1_fan: w take
[1:35:01] HippoSquirrel: What is pros? I've never heard of this
[1:35:01] Lyghtsaber: @kangascasts why is yugioh better than mtg
[1:35:03] arshg13: PROS is very pog
[1:35:03] MultilateralDev: pros is so damn good
[1:35:05] KSnOwnage: W
[1:35:06] BottleGnomes: is "pros" wordplay
[1:35:09] desemaia: what is PROS
[1:35:15] leagueofemily: and there were even some good stories from us waiting to record that didn't make it to the ep rip
[1:35:19] karlheinzstockfootage: @saint734 yeah, i should let the bad joke lie/ :/
[1:35:20] saint734: @travisgafford have you ever considered a show like PROS before?
[1:35:21] Ikancast: @desemaia the aftershow with players
[1:35:22] MacDaAce: @leagueofemily  Pros was soooooooo good this week! wow!
[1:35:28] leagueofemily: it's a wordplay on prose
[1:35:31] arshg13: @desemaia half hourish podcast with lcs pros on the lcs youtube channel
[1:35:36] Azikielboi: ddx

[1:35:53] leagueofemily: wow Travis is dunking on my player choices I HAVE FOLLOWED UMTI SINCE HIS DEBUT MAN
[1:35:58] womboboys: Stop sucking and they'll stay longer Kappa
[1:35:59] saint734: Prince clearly washed in LCK too
[1:36:03] MacDaAce: UmTi is an awesome player and I will be super sad if he leaves
[1:36:08] Lyghtsaber: @kangascasts so true

[1:36:18] starlitspirit: dont disrespect the general smh
[1:36:21] Lyghtsaber: saturday mognings op
[1:36:44] lionation: are there any sponsors rn?
[1:37:03] MacDaAce: Solid content
[1:37:05] s41ntm: team mandated responses
[1:37:17] saint734: @leagueofemily please get Jatt to bring back Teamfight Breakdown
[1:37:27] Ikancast: hearing olleh say he looks at the winrates to pick his champ and umti responding that he knows how to scout him now was funny
[1:37:39] littleindianman12: @travisgafford currently has 25K views which is pretty good
[1:37:40] kamikazplatypus: yeah riot's promotion of the stuff that they do is really wack, i wanna see like youtube insta tiktok twitter EVERYTHING
[1:37:40] MacDaAce: ^
[1:37:49] saint734: bruh when they were talking about being yes men on what's good/bad
[1:37:54] HippoSquirrel: Am I the only person that misses the analyst lounge between games?
[1:37:56] leagueofemily: it's a good episode in my biased opinion
[1:37:56] MacDaAce: Best one yet 1000%
[1:38:02] arshg13: @kamikazplatypus lcs needs to be simulcasted on tiktok with subway surfers IM SAYIN
[1:38:06] BottleGnomes: it was good
[1:38:08] littleindianman12: @leagueofemily you killed it
[1:38:09] kamikazplatypus: @arshg13 LET HIM COOK
[1:38:15] saint734: lol the NFL stuck Taylor Swift's face on literally everything, Riot is slacking
[1:38:15] karlheinzstockfootage: getting lck or lpl challengers is a weird dice throw.  yeah, you could get a berserker.  you could also sell your franchise to a shipping app.  or be fly.
[1:38:22] CSiers: @arshg13 arsh stole this idea
[1:38:34] glassjaws: @saint734 Which LCS player should date her next?
[1:38:43] arshg13: @CSiers show me proof charlie.
[1:39:08] MacDaAce: I am now fully invested in UmTi and always love hearing from Huhi, and the moment Huhi said he'd cook kimchi for Umti was so wholesome
[1:39:09] Ikancast: @glassjaws insanity. shes a big fan of zac mid
[1:39:10] lionation: @glassjaws imaqtpie
[1:39:20] saint734: @dalimccubist you could also have peter zhang who cheats players out of money, and shows you clips of knight and says it's a rookie LOL
[1:39:22] BottleGnomes: ex prose
[1:39:36] PogoStomp: Yeah I think this type of show does a similar thing as what streams used to do.  It lets you get to know the players as people
[1:39:51] kamikazplatypus: just do podcasts with patreons its SO BROKEN, like its so insane how great of a format it is and how willing people are to pay for access to that kind of long form conversational content for commutes and stuff

[1:40:20] TheAlphaMatt: Getting a DL on for an episode with all ADCs for example could be great
[1:40:27] saint734: they watch a lot LOL
[1:40:35] iamelvis4: Pros never want to tell the really interesting story‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why pro athlete podcasts are better because they tell it all
[1:40:44] patchesfaces: Ravens had Ray Lewis and Ed Reed at the championship game just yesterday

[1:46:32] TheQuackleDK: How is LCS so far? Ironically enough I haven't been able to watch it since it changed back to being on weekends.

[1:47:34] arshg13: we know what bingo is lol
[1:47:35] desemaia: has any1 talked about how fast the day goes. doesnt feel like audience has chance to really settle in, probably not great for viewership either
[1:47:35] HippoSquirrel: i loved the bingo cards
[1:47:38] arshg13: also its not like normal bingo
[1:47:42] karlheinzstockfootage: eight teams, math aint hard best of 3's f-m in prime time
[1:47:46] kerokerogrips: did we have a game puases take yet ?
[1:47:56] arshg13: ok the review from young people was positive for the bingo cards lol
[1:48:02] MacDaAce: But who will win the first Bingo??
[1:48:03] karlheinzstockfootage: or sat sun
[1:48:03] Briszee: yeah blame kangas!
[1:48:14] arshg13: flowers' chad energy makes players too terrified to type /pause
[1:48:21] leagueofemily: yea
[1:48:23] leagueofemily: T_T
[1:48:43] TheQuackleDK: I can't even watch the dive anymore to recap on the lcs, so I'm just completely out of the loop
[1:48:45] arshg13: i meant specifically on the broadcast side! i didnt mean people at lcs werent laid off
[1:48:51] ixbx: didn't Azeal open the show with a comment or am I misremembering
[1:48:58] the1andonlycorbin: it would be fun if the fans could pick and choose from a list their own bingo cards on the Riot Esports page similar to Pick ems
[1:48:59] leagueofemily: he's amazing
[1:48:59] arshg13: the whole studio content team was wiped, its fucking insane
[1:49:08] brandywineriver: THEY LAID OFF THE GUY PRODUCING THE DIVE????
[1:49:09] bondance: Can't you hire him to produce Hotline League?
[1:49:09] desemaia: is it true that they were just contracted out to 3rd party. so same staff just not under riot?
[1:49:10] arshg13: btw chat they did that dash-kobe fight scene
[1:49:11] saint734: @ixbx players guy and the dive writer got hit
[1:49:24] kamikazplatypus: yeah we sent lorn!
[1:49:25] KSnOwnage: LUL
[1:49:29] kamikazplatypus: LECHEFANDOM

[1:49:35] arshg13: HAHAH
[1:49:37] Ikancast: NA carrying EU yet again
[1:49:39] patchesfaces: How many observers does LCS have does ClakeyD still work for riot?
[1:49:42] phinvincible: i was literally wondering how LEC was able to do replays with 1 observer, guess Lauren saved the day

[1:49:59] CSiers: manny ResidentSleeper
[1:50:36] arshg13: yeah it sucks, the people who did all the new stage stuff are gone
[1:50:42] arshg13: and the new stage is fucking awesome
[1:50:43] karlheinzstockfootage: it's NOT a 10 team league anymore, as mark is rearranging the deck chairs.  just cause travis sees no value in bo3's, doesn't meant an executive decision cannot be made, unless the parent company is making mark a patsy
[1:51:10] brandywineriver: no youtube prime
[1:51:32] TheAlphaMatt: I'm surprised there hasn't been a Caedrel take yet
[1:51:33] arshg13: youtube has less incentive to sub and stuff bc less ads
[1:51:40] MacDaAce: It sucks that its never the people who caused the layoffs that lose their jobs... just those who worked hard to put them in the position to make those choices...
[1:51:41] karlheinzstockfootage: oh man deep in the bottle prolly must type less :)
[1:51:50] TheAlphaMatt: Just feels like something that would've been on the show
[1:51:57] TheQuackleDK: We're used to streamers not responding to youtube comments, when dual streaming
[1:51:57] HippoSquirrel: HippoSquirrel gifted a Tier 1 sub to leagueofemily! They have given 9 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:52:09] leagueofemily: @HippoSquirrel Aww ty!
[1:52:13] saint734: @TheAlphaMatt too busy eating viewership and becoming Riot's western face of league
[1:52:20] finalnintendokid: BOO NO FAKEGOD HATE
[1:52:23] ixbx: they were power ranked, based on their roster
[1:52:24] chezapeza: Shopify rebellion is not TSM, I would argue Shopify has garnered alot of fans from the focus they have put on NA talent
[1:52:30] HippoSquirrel: @leagueofemily cap22Chad cap22Drank
[1:52:30] Nazhjin: travis HATES esports as a marketing tool!!!
[1:52:47] Avvura: Can they please Rebrand thogh
[1:52:47] arshg13: fakegod is good actually
[1:52:50] woodmoore: zeyzal and fakegod are not bad though?
[1:52:50] TheAlphaMatt: @saint734 I meant a take about him costreaming lcs this week and the viewership changes
[1:52:56] arshg13: tomio is their sub
[1:53:00] brandywineriver: @Nazhjin meanwhile, the best team of all time....
[1:53:02] Natibe_: I mean they beat my team C9, c9 is in first place so obviously SR is the best team in the league!
[1:53:02] OldManMovingSlow: they beat C9
[1:53:03] Avvura: I love hearing SHOPIFY this SHOPIFY that -_-
[1:53:07] TheAlphaMatt: Yeah Zeyzal and Fakegod are both good
[1:53:10] brandywineriver: (at least their old name)
[1:53:11] s41ntm: disguised toast wasnt the goat team yuge shocker guys
[1:53:15] karlheinzstockfootage: @chezapeza they kept bugi, tsm with better coaching
[1:53:17] MacDaAce: Love the players, do not care about the org.
[1:53:18] HippoSquirrel: I'm a big Zeyzal fan
[1:53:18] the1andonlycorbin: yup
[1:54:00] HippoSquirrel: I appreciate Shopify because they invest in a lot of open source technology that I use at my job.
[1:54:02] Nazhjin: sadly licorice was left with a pretty rough situation after teams had basically locked
[1:54:04] brandywineriver: it would be better if they were called "rebellion" as shorthand
[1:54:04] ixbx: Lic news broke so late,
[1:54:07] Nazhjin: i feel most bad for him
[1:54:11] Lyghtsaber: i thought licorice got timelined. his job was gone after other teams were set
[1:54:19] arshg13: @Nazhjin they really shouldve dropped the gg eg announcement 2 weeks earlier man
[1:54:22] woopsiedaisies: no fucking shot haha
[1:54:23] gibson8686: gibson6P gibson6P gibson6P gibson6P gibson6P gibson6P
[1:54:27] karlheinzstockfootage: @HippoSquirrel me too , zeyzal has been on the longest rumspringa.  think he <3's tech more than farming.
[1:54:31] shawnshaunsean: licorice is na cabocard
[1:54:31] Nazhjin: @arshg13 we didnt know until a few days before
[1:54:44] Nazhjin: obviously I wish we had known so players had a better situation but inero did all he could
[1:54:44] Cubbyxx: @shawnshaunsean ? expand?
[1:54:45] Ikancast: its nice to zeyzal back although i do miss his streams from a couple years ago
[1:54:45] brandywineriver: now he is playing on a bad team for not a lot of money :(
[1:54:57] MacDaAce: So... who picks up Licorice after this split though?
[1:54:58] Nazhjin: and when I say "we" i mean 2 people
[1:54:59] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:55:03] brandywineriver: then again they beat c9 soooooo
[1:55:08] arshg13: @Nazhjin i know, i just mean riot shouldve said it earlier
[1:55:12] kamikazplatypus: There are a lot of players who also live somewhere where costs are quite low, so taking a small paycheque to be cozy in tier 2 is great
[1:55:18] the1andonlycorbin: they are fun players to watch, not my team but I like some of them
[1:55:20] chezapeza: Its easy to root for the team comprised of developing players, they dont need to win the split to carve out an identity people can get behind
[1:55:25] BottleGnomes: I like Zeyzal.  I think he kind of got unfairly scapegoated for sneaky's retirement
[1:55:27] Nazhjin: @arshg13 riot shouldnt have done anything that they did behind closed doors
[1:55:27] saint734: @kamikazplatypus ie grifters
[1:55:29] kelby: LUL
[1:55:35] Konnoke: lol
[1:55:36] brandywineriver: Rebellion should be the shorthand, not shopify
[1:55:37] HippoSquirrel: HippoSquirrel gifted a Tier 1 sub to dalimccubist! They have given 10 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:55:40] Ikancast: shopify rebellion won valorant game changers if you like that
[1:55:50] Lyghtsaber: handshook rosters
[1:55:50] arshg13: surely we didnt announce it after offseason was almost done right :)))))
[1:55:52] GrogSR: damn I didn't realize travis hated us like that
[1:55:55] kelby: GG roster got fkd
[1:55:58] Nazhjin: 95% of players were verbal
[1:56:02] karlheinzstockfootage: @HippoSquirrel Thanks for the gift sub! :) chatVibes cooker6Sb
[1:56:08] arshg13: litearlly every top was locked
[1:56:16] brandywineriver: Rebellion is making the mistake of competing for "Green" brand with FlyQuest
[1:56:17] arshg13: it was like super verbal on literally every top laner
[1:56:20] kamikazplatypus: @saint734 not grifters, just not willing to get locked into playing on a team that is so weak that it kills their LCS career, when they can instead stay dominant in tier 2 and on top of their game
[1:56:21] HippoSquirrel: @dalimccubist This is the funniest thing I've heard all year
[1:56:26] Nazhjin: there was 2-3 roster situations
[1:56:27] s41ntm: why didnt shopify simply go against their verbal contract (not a joke they shouldve done that)
[1:56:28] Nazhjin: including a super team
[1:56:29] MacDaAce: @GrogSR  its the whole TSM spot i think
[1:56:43] Nazhjin: inero is a wizard
[1:57:00] TheAlphaMatt: I heard it was Licorice, Spica, Young, Zven, Chime
[1:57:01] saint734: @kamikazplatypus that's called grifting; eating t2 checks instead of actually playing at T1
[1:57:13] steph_curry_no1_fan: golden state were too busy overpaying jordan poole and andrew wiggins not enough money for an esports team
[1:57:13] GrogSR: @MacDaAce I see
[1:57:26] karlheinzstockfootage: the list players after contraction that seem just weird spica, licorice.  hard stop.  they are native... don't get it
[1:57:35] FrostedBacon: Teams get rid of their only shotcaller all the time lol
[1:57:41] desemaia: being on an esports team has to be such a stressful job, can lose it at any time, super difficult to get back in, funding going down across the board
[1:57:42] MacDaAce: @TheAlphaMatt Now thats a roster
[1:57:43] ixbx: SRs drafts feel so up-hill
[1:57:59] FrostedBacon: Look at Rogue. Got rid of their only 2 talkers and now perma bottom 3

[1:58:49] arshg13: insanity picks are very fun to watch
[1:58:54] arshg13: sion vayne probably the best game of lcs so far
[1:59:01] DaniGrim: I don't think that SR win standard. Their strength is strong play with non-meta picks.
[1:59:02] desemaia: true, standard is boring af. Udyr top makes me go to sleep so fast
[1:59:13] Lyghtsaber: you can always just play what's strong against the current strong standard
[1:59:33] Lyghtsaber: anti-stratting
[1:59:41] DaniGrim: I don't think it says they're not good. There are 100 teams that can play good standard, why not have a team that plays different?
[1:59:47] desemaia: nunu mid for insanity
[1:59:50] MacDaAce: So can teams like IMT and SR start being "creative" now?
[1:59:53] DaniGrim: G2 in 2019 wasn't the best in playing standard, they were the best with their style

[2:00:21] MacDaAce: IMT is making content
[2:00:22] Ikancast: i dont know the order of the roster, but if they had bvoy first i know him and zeyzal have a good relationship with each other so it might have influenced if so
[2:00:34] MacDaAce: RIP
[2:00:45] karlheinzstockfootage: it is weird spica is out there and he would fit well into shopify solomod
[2:01:05] finalnintendokid: IMT is no long associated with Detroit which is a massive dub
[2:01:36] MacDaAce: Could Team Mcdonalds beat IMT or SR right now?
[2:01:59] kerokerogrips: did they mention the tsm news about how its only 9 people there now ?
[2:02:21] saint734: everyone on TSM was on a end of split deal
[2:02:27] j_tripper: IMT cares? it really is over
[2:03:26] MacDaAce: clip that one

[2:04:14] steph_curry_no1_fan: shopify rebellion has fans?

[2:04:43] GrogSR: listening to how shit we are
[2:04:45] woodmoore: this man is coping so hard, shopify is clearly better than c9
[2:04:50] MacDaAce: D:
[2:04:56] BottleGnomes: paid shills in chat
[2:04:57] CSiers: @kelby #ad
[2:05:04] brandywineriver: @Jon_Oki SR failing to keep their high performing support in Chime and pick up an available high performing NA top laners (Revenge, Licorice) is why they are currently in last place in the LCS
[2:05:07] MacDaAce: #paid
[2:05:16] karlheinzstockfootage: disclosure: kelby literally represents ludwig, right?
[2:05:19] GodzillaGuerilla: the big problem from the start for SR is their name
[2:05:27] finalnintendokid: @travisgafford IMT is not longer associated with Detroit which is why they are doing better KEKW
[2:05:29] slowcookah: Dario's the dude?!!
[2:05:32] brandywineriver: shop delivers for everyone who isn't amazon so it's hard to hate them...

[2:06:27] kangascasts: @evies_ haha wait till you hear what my plan for the mascot's LCS finals integration is
[2:06:46] kamikazplatypus: its their "home base" for their ownership groups
[2:06:49] Cubbyxx: brawl? @kangascasts
[2:06:50] Jon_Oki: @HippoSquirrel lol its not literal
[2:06:51] kamikazplatypus: Axiomatic i think
[2:07:16] CSiers: @evies_ im bring the gorilla idea back
[2:07:17] kangascasts: @Cubbyxx WWE style scripted fights between mascots based on who wins game in the bo5 series
[2:07:27] karlheinzstockfootage: ted le-Esports
[2:07:33] arshg13: @kangascasts youve been pushing this for ages knagas when will u make it happen
[2:07:43] slowcookah: @saint734 hell yeah

[2:08:03] kelby: I am a huge LCS fan that's why

[2:08:14] heftychen: @kelby hi kelby, big fan
[2:08:16] Snitzel13: sorry to hear that cubby
[2:08:20] saint734: if TL keeps Haeri do they make Worlds last year
[2:08:30] kelby: @heftychen me too!
[2:08:30] Fingerszs: @kelby yoooooooooooooo
[2:08:31] guttler: LOL Secret Lair incoming?
[2:08:45] jigglyduffy: Top Gun fucking rocks tho
[2:08:57] kamikazplatypus: the most lopsided stakes of all time Kelby got GRIFTED hahaha
[2:08:57] heftychen: @kelby i'm glad you're practicing self love effectively =D
[2:09:00] finalnintendokid: @saint734 lol no
[2:09:01] kangascasts: @bassnasty help me pitch it to Riot I swear I can produce/script/choreograph the whole thing they just need to let me
[2:09:01] jigglyduffy: @kelby make him watch it anyway
[2:09:03] kelby: Travis is a very stubborn lad chat
[2:09:04] CSiers: its an ok movie lets not get ahead of ourselves @Cubbyxx
[2:09:10] NoxParagon: Thats like saying, I know how fast and furious ends, why watch
[2:09:13] kamikazplatypus: @heftychen hello my GOAT
[2:09:31] womboboys: 90s kids talking bout Top Gun kek
[2:09:33] NoxParagon: Man, that star wars ending was wild, might as well not watch the next 3
[2:09:37] karlheinzstockfootage: keep strong travis you never need to watch eith top gun film.  now there is something called top goon.... whoah
[2:09:41] OG_Plumwick: well they have the same coach
[2:09:42] MacDaAce: Valid
[2:09:48] daisydupe23: based
[2:09:52] kelby: C9's greatest weakness is playing and practicing in NA
[2:09:54] kelby: duh
[2:09:56] Jon_Oki: @NoxParagon lmaoooooooooooooo L
[2:10:01] arshg13: @kelby actually real
[2:10:06] woodmoore: they definitely addressed their weakness in mid lane
[2:10:08] KSnOwnage: C9 paying more to play against weaker competition to be a weaker team LUL

[2:10:11] Lyghtsaber: c9 greatest weakness is ego
[2:10:26] LateNiteArc: LateNiteArc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[2:10:28] woodmoore: @Lyghtsaber agree on this 100% blaber especially
[2:10:31] saint734: C9 greatest weakness is when hands diff doesn't work anymore LOL
[2:10:33] ixbx: if c9 wins MSI, they put a scab team in for LCS and bootcamp in KR until worlds
[2:10:35] littleindianman12: It was a different coaching staff and different players
[2:10:44] littleindianman12: @woodmoore huh
[2:10:51] kelby: @ixbx this is an amazing idea, I LOVE IT
[2:10:51] OG_Plumwick: the mithy effect
[2:10:56] kerokerogrips: international the struggle has been top lane
[2:10:59] saint734: @ixbx Chovy will win a worlds title before C9 wins another international B05
[2:11:03] NoxParagon: Damn, its BO1 what adaptation do ya want

[2:11:06] arshg13: except the fact that jojo has teh widest champ pool and best laning in the league
[2:11:19] arshg13: and the fact that vulcan is able to play enchanters and engagers better than zven
[2:11:19] MacDaAce: facts
[2:11:26] karlheinzstockfootage: c9's greatest weakness is the logo.
[2:11:32] Lyghtsaber: my ahri is better than emenes lcs finals ahri
[2:11:35] arshg13: and the fact that blaber jojo are inherently more aggressive and capable internationally than any prev duo
[2:11:40] OG_Plumwick: havent liked vulcan personally
[2:11:40] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:11:50] the1andonlycorbin: I disagree, Jojo seems to be on a more similar page with their playstyle compared to Emenes last year and is more versatile, plus better communication
[2:12:04] ivegarossirl: Then wtf would Caller recommend changing?? Regions? XD
[2:12:10] arshg13: ok his floor isn't just higher though right. we are comparing the floor of a skyscraper penthouse to like. sea level
[2:12:14] daisydupe23: c9 might win lcs still going 0/6 at worlds tho
[2:12:15] steph_curry_no1_fan: c9's greatest weakness is when they have to play a team that they can't hands diff and actually have to use some macro sense
[2:12:26] littleindianman12: @woodmoore he literally has said multiple times that that we is willing to play maokai rell and sej. He literally played more games of maokai than carry games last year what are you smoking?
[2:12:27] saint734: @daisydupe23 you mean 0-4 LOL
[2:12:31] daisydupe23: nrg going to worlds finals this yr tho
[2:12:35] karlheinzstockfootage: BTW, vulcan lives a charmed life from clutch gaming til now.  nost na players don't keep getting raises
[2:12:36] PogoStomp: Adapting is a lot easier when you have more options. Both JoJo and Vulcan bring more options.
[2:12:38] str8puggin: im glad he had the balls to slam a vayne
[2:13:01] arshg13: @str8puggin HUH
[2:13:03] littleindianman12: I would say blaber
[2:13:05] OG_Plumwick: im scared because he lost he wont do it again
[2:13:07] saint734: @dalimccubist Vulcan was the best player on that clutch roster unironically
[2:13:09] littleindianman12: but blaber is older now
[2:13:09] OG_Plumwick: which would be sad
[2:13:11] karlheinzstockfootage: vulcan is basically hakuho if you sit back and think about it
[2:13:13] MacDaAce: I think C9 needs real competition. Every year there is 1 team that is "clearly the best" and almost every year that team loses come the end of the year
[2:13:22] saint734: Huni peaked way higher, but Vulcan was the best player
[2:13:25] Lyghtsaber: its only not long term if they can't afford it, but the fact they can do it this year means its affordable to some extent
[2:13:30] saint734: caller gotta let the hosts talk bro
[2:13:56] karlheinzstockfootage: @saint734 and he's the 5th best player on this roster, still not getting a real paycut
[2:14:07] woodmoore: @littleindianman12 get off your burner blaber
[2:14:19] saint734: @dalimccubist C9 hasn't paid anyone nearly as much as they paid Perkz lol
[2:14:21] littleindianman12: @woodmoore what do you mean?
[2:14:34] ivegarossirl: Once again... if not these changes, then what?? What would realistically help adaptation more than these?
[2:14:53] OG_Plumwick: coaching staff
[2:14:59] OG_Plumwick: the "systems"
[2:15:07] woodmoore: @woodmoore i am teasing you by saying that you are actually blaber on an anonymous account
[2:15:07] saint734: C9 should hire TL Dodo
[2:15:15] karlheinzstockfootage: i do not feel bad about vulcan just going split to split and exploiting desperate ors.  bless him for vacuuming up of the vc money
[2:15:33] Lyghtsaber: they forced a dive without a wave because they felt pressured from max grubbys and it was joever from there. not much to tell about players from that
[2:16:00] finalnintendokid: We literally had this same conversation 3 years ago with Perkz
[2:16:08] karlheinzstockfootage: the vulcan/ayla puts the the lie to a player's union
[2:16:49] MacDaAce: IDK sounds like scrims aren't giving them that data
[2:16:54] arshg13: this guy is just rephrasing hte superteam problem lol
[2:17:00] NoxParagon: Does the caller realize they have been in how many finals that last couple of splits?
[2:17:01] arshg13: also a lot of teams are capable of beating c9 rn
[2:17:13] spiffco: g2 is a bad comparison, they drop games all the time "when it doesn't matter"
[2:17:27] karlheinzstockfootage: inb4 heretix wins lec
[2:17:28] arshg13: and many teams are beating c9 in scrims ! its not g2 level
[2:17:45] KSnOwnage: NRG got good data from losing to C9 in scrims all season and beat them in finals WubTF
[2:17:53] saint734: gapped by Contractz in Finals LOL
[2:17:59] steph_curry_no1_fan: PopNemo
[2:18:03] MacDaAce: But if you are losing in scrims and winning on stage, does that team still not get anything?
[2:18:08] BottleGnomes: for adjustment in Bo5 you should hire analysts not coaches
[2:18:16] bondance: yeah Contractz was playing like a psycho against C9 and G2
[2:18:24] j_tripper: contractz is just the goat
[2:18:48] saint734: @MacDaAce scrim world champions G2
[2:18:49] desemaia: no road shows?
[2:18:56] numiiigoesrawrz: inspired üíö
[2:18:56] Lyghtsaber: or at least the person that remembered that needed to happen
[2:19:01] desemaia: didnt Naz say they were going to keep doing them
[2:19:02] saint734: @desemaia poverty league
[2:19:23] MacDaAce: @saint734 fair
[2:19:37] saint734: show over everyone leave before travis starts talking about magic
[2:19:39] desemaia: just put lcs studios in Phreaks basement at this point, at least there is some history there
[2:19:45] OG_Plumwick: im surprised no caller brought up the palafox interview essentially calling all the c9 players bums except jojo

[2:20:19] bondance: T I D Y C A T S sponsorship incoming??
