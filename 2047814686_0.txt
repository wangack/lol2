[0:11:10] falconforcex: love you monte
[0:11:37] lazink: go to Doms vods?
[0:11:48] VehementPhoenix: LPL vods have been a massive pain this 2024, its the worst

[0:14:29] DixMX: tehre's also the lpl website
[0:14:31] ogoaxe: ***
[0:14:40] DixMX: lpl,qq
[0:14:45] ogoaxe: If I am not stupid, that's the link.
[0:14:49] DixMX: lpl,qq,com
[0:14:54] ProdigalChicken: monkaS
[0:15:15] archie7497: I know that you have to cover the bilibili logo when you are streaming on twitch. Dom does the same
[0:15:15] fernysilva19: They played at different places so when fpx vs we was done they hopped to blg game half way thur
[0:15:21] lazink: imagine if there was one big repository for all this, that a company pays the leagues to hold
[0:15:32] Kerengeoff: i think i saw game 2
[0:15:41] VehementPhoenix: the fact that it actually loaded is a good sigb
[0:15:43] VehementPhoenix: sign
[0:15:50] DixMX: oh lol
[0:15:54] DixMX: there it is
[0:16:06] ogoaxe: Great success!
[0:16:07] RViegs: boom we did it
[0:16:22] Banterlife: Monte has conquered chinese streaming sites watch out world
[0:16:34] fernysilva19: Lettsgo
[0:16:39] DixMX: yw
[0:17:05] Iradium228: Evenin
[0:17:06] VehementPhoenix: the fact that manually typing in an insane url is how we get lpl vods in the west is damning and inexcusable for Riot
[0:17:08] Phaetox: Yt chat is just us watching in a second window
[0:17:08] Iradium228: And or Mornin
[0:17:11] TheExperienceAwaits: we did it honorisYAYY
[0:17:23] Phaetox: We got you fam
[0:17:25] najafan: There's a bot that can cross post comments between yt and twitch btw
[0:17:25] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: F it.. we do it live
[0:17:30] ProdigalChicken: LUL
[0:17:39] archie7497: @montecristo just to be safe you might want to cover the logo/text on the top right corner. Twitch t&c or something
[0:17:47] Woolev: WHAT BULDAK FLAVOUR?
[0:17:49] Banterlife: Oh yea you get stats on ur stream
[0:17:53] DixMX: i hate lolesports too

[0:20:02] archie7497: Btw Dom showed the bilibili video player and how it's literally integrated with the game. Hovering over the champion potrait and scoreboard shows additional stats.
[0:20:07] VehementPhoenix: all roas lead to Lulu Zeri
[0:20:08] colonelsoap: it has been REMADE
[0:20:11] friskybusinesses: BLG didnt look convincing to me in this series, i need to see how they do throughout the split
[0:20:18] Komarimasita: wohoo more games to watch!!  the timing of this is perfct with my work hours
[0:20:18] friskybusinesses: they wont be JDG last year thats for sure
[0:20:54] DixMX: if only Riot hadn't laid off 11% of their staff Kappa
[0:20:54] najafan: Scientists just say it's impossible.
[0:21:07] frexyseek: POG only elite gamers put MD in their soup i guess thats why im silver
[0:21:12] zen__cloud: what's your favorite type of mandu
[0:21:18] VehementPhoenix: i wish mandu was easily available, it takes so much effort to find in random NA town
[0:21:26] latisrof: we vs fpx was a better series
[0:21:46] DixMX: you can use arrow keys as well I think
[0:22:04] latisrof: BLG strongest all chinese roster of all time?
[0:22:06] DixMX: oh mb
[0:22:15] najafan: I live in a decent sized city, and it's still so hard to find a lot of various types of food.
[0:22:29] najafan: So frustrating.
[0:22:47] friskybusinesses: 2024 and we still cant get 1 editor to divide up the streams
[0:23:02] najafan: No place near me that makes fresh ricotta, for instance
[0:23:08] Iradium228: Is there anyway to up the source quality from 720p?
[0:23:21] colonelsoap: is J4 really that much stronger at lvl 2?
[0:23:27] najafan: There's an Italian grocery store, with a deli. And they don't make their own ricotta.
[0:23:30] Iradium228: That's unfortunate
[0:23:38] lazink: Ricotta and motzarella are fairly easy cheeses to make
[0:23:52] najafan: Sure, but it's the principle of the thing.
[0:24:13] garry_leonard: xun casual walking through mid pulling a flash
[0:24:29] lazink: I do aplaude you for using ricotta instead of cottage cheese though!
[0:24:46] DixMX: Orianna 0% WR LUL
[0:24:48] janz8: null-magic mantle
[0:24:56] najafan: Also I can't find a place that does decent mole, no restaurant uses it here.

[0:25:00] najafan: So frustrating.
[0:26:09] lazink: try finding guanciale
[0:26:25] najafan: Yeah, we have guanciale.
[0:26:45] sejjy: W
[0:26:47] VehementPhoenix: Missing the knockup and still getting the kill is such a devastator
[0:26:47] RViegs: LMAO
[0:26:48] GingerBeardJo: OOOO
[0:27:01] Gh0stStyle: wooooow
[0:27:01] RViegs: N OWAY
[0:27:03] GingerBeardJo: Kreygasm
[0:27:04] toothless0108: ive seen enough
[0:27:06] friskybusinesses: tilter play
[0:27:08] toothless0108: BLG world 2024
[0:27:10] Komarimasita: blg playing out of their minds
[0:27:14] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: getting away with murder there
[0:27:25] VehementPhoenix: piledriver to the morale right there
[0:27:28] Iradium228: Knight even makes sure to keep the heat of the turret up so that J4 dies faster after him
[0:27:41] RViegs: blind EQ too nice
[0:27:44] Gh0stStyle: blind
[0:27:48] Komarimasita: thats just insane i thought they were both dead to xin
[0:27:53] ogoaxe: Jesus allmighty, they are playing a different game
[0:28:01] Thythorns: Yup, I see those plays in LEC
[0:28:03] GingerBeardJo: there was ward there i think still sick tho
[0:28:05] Gh0stStyle: quite dirty
[0:28:19] kraethan: They had vision from lane bush ward right?
[0:28:23] Iradium228: The 720p is worth it for these sick plays
[0:28:26] archie7497: Regarding the idyr cheater recall. That is the standard udyr opening vs rumble. You sit in the furthest brush, the one near the rumbles tower and harass the rumble and make him miss the XP of the 3 melee minions of the first wave then the udyr crashes wave 3. If he knows the enemy jungler is botside then he can also proxy wave 4. Either way  you recall and buy null.
[0:28:35] iSmurfyy: Xun walked by the ward behind the red
[0:28:42] DixMX: is Tabe stil the coach?
[0:28:59] Kerengeoff: they knew he was going that was so really good guess
[0:29:02] Kerengeoff: to where he was
[0:29:03] MissingMatter: But it was so close to in range, if it wasn't, that he's like 90% known by how long he's been out of the ward
[0:29:06] Thythorns: Tabe is taking a break
[0:29:07] GingerBeardJo: blind or not that was disgusting
[0:29:17] DixMX: oh thx
[0:29:30] colonelsoap: Xun has so much presence on the map
[0:29:31] lou_saso: what are you eating monte?
[0:29:31] kraethan: Based on how mini map looms that might be in range but would have to test, close either way
[0:29:40] kraethan: Looks*

[0:30:23] Shriez: first its dry chicken, now its shin ramen
[0:30:28] lou_saso: how is korean mcdonalds?

[0:30:49] fatalqwerty: Oh wow I just ate lunch, BANGERS Only is on, i'm unbothered and moisturized, life feels good rn FeelsGoodMan
[0:30:51] janz8: what are you in korea for?
[0:30:58] mortmos: @carneasadaenjoyer have you tried buldak?
[0:31:06] gerbilsdontexist: i haven't heard of that brand
[0:31:16] Rumblextristana: Why do these lower tier chinese teams keep importing washed up korean players?
[0:31:16] Novensiles: i kinda like neoguri but it's not up to shin
[0:31:20] gerbilsdontexist: your wife is Korean right Monte?
[0:31:25] DixMX: are you gonna take your kid to LoL Park?
[0:31:27] Iradium228: Gotta make sure he's on the Korean Hype Train
[0:31:35] VehementPhoenix: How old is Max? Been a minute since I heard a checkup
[0:31:48] Badseed31: You did not want him to learn the Colorado way?
[0:31:56] fatalqwerty: @carneasadaenjoyer Yeah at one point in League's life Susie was everyone's Mom, but Monte monopolized her for his own FeelsBadMan
[0:32:02] mortmos: @carneasadaenjoyer Definetely look it up, its super good.  The carbonara flavor or the cheese flavor. Pretty spicy though
[0:32:15] gerbilsdontexist: i will try to find it in our local asian store. thanks
[0:32:18] najafan: The Colorado way is coming fifth in a strawpoll in her new district. :D
[0:32:18] GingerBeardJo: north or south Kappa
[0:32:41] fatalqwerty: See NA!? This is how you juggle tower aggro! SwiftRage
[0:32:44] Kerengeoff: jesus
[0:32:45] smithpw: Hi Monte. Hi Chat
[0:32:51] fatalqwerty: Targamas take notes pls
[0:33:03] axelerator: compared to the dive C9 tried to against SR...
[0:33:06] colonelsoap: i haven't seen a team with this much pressure in a while
[0:33:08] Komarimasita: knight looks more aggro with xun than he did with kanavi
[0:33:08] archie7497: As dom put it. "They are mega chinese"
[0:33:11] Siraon: is there a chance youll bring back the reading stream/videos, maybe on the lfn culture, or was engagement just too low? i loved the poe/lovecraft reading lol
[0:33:13] fatalqwerty: c9 dive was so fucking tilting
[0:33:36] Kerengeoff: knight
[0:33:36] najafan: @Siraon I asked him like 2 weeks ago, he said he was too busy this year
[0:33:37] gerbilsdontexist: Monte you remember that C9 dive in worlds lmao
[0:33:37] meIIerr: knight took it
[0:33:38] Komarimasita: ON took aggro
[0:33:39] Novensiles: @Siraon yea I liked those
[0:33:39] demonbunnymd: knight did
[0:33:41] Komarimasita: and died
[0:33:42] meIIerr: he auto first
[0:33:47] Komarimasita: oh at the end nvm
[0:33:56] friskybusinesses: ok maybe they pretty good
[0:34:14] fatalqwerty: Someone send this dive to the West
[0:34:19] kraethan: For reference, lolesports site says lpl starts jan 30, so might have 1080p vods there soon?
[0:34:24] Komarimasita: thats definitely a take notes dive
[0:34:25] axelerator: when you watch lpl do dives its good shit but when LCS teams do it... my god
[0:34:35] axelerator: oh and the T1 dive was also sexy
[0:34:53] Komarimasita: i cant wait for MSi, i need to see T1s early game vs this
[0:35:11] DilfZaddy: would you encourage the mini christos to go into casting with the mini doas?
[0:35:12] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:35:14] meIIerr: tbh I don't see the gap getting close, G2 show some good stuff when they try hard, but I don't trust bb on the international stage
[0:35:17] colonelsoap: YES
[0:35:17] HorsezPwn42: KC clears tbh
[0:35:19] ASWstreams: yes

[0:35:44] meIIerr: bo and cabo woke up
[0:35:49] meIIerr: targamas last game also was on point
[0:35:50] GingerBeardJo: shopify #1 yes?
[0:35:57] archie7497: The only hope for any team to beat blg this year was jdg but after watching them this week it looks like blg will just run over the rest of the league
[0:36:02] VehementPhoenix: C9 number 15 and I'm here to celebrate it
[0:36:02] meIIerr: they start winning when they stopped playing towards bot
[0:36:29] kraethan: Croco has been in the trash can for awhile
[0:36:30] DixMX: on a zero-pressure day, KC clears BLG
[0:36:31] rhjf: i forgot there were top laners in this game
[0:36:31] Krethas: Heya Monte. Watched the Tokyo Godfathers 4play episode - it was really good, thoroughly dissected the underlying themes. Wasn't sold on the LFN culture channel until then. Looking forward to more episodes reviewing similar mature-audience-targeted films.
[0:36:40] otaf3: hey monte, is lcs dead? 8 teams only, no views like in the past
[0:36:47] fatalqwerty: is LPL on 14.2 too?
[0:36:59] awoogawooogawoo: you guys still watch lcs?
[0:37:05] iSmurfyy: Why is it dying?
[0:37:08] rhjf: i watch c9
[0:37:08] HorsezPwn42: i watch c9 but thats it
[0:37:22] fatalqwerty: @iSmurfyy Riot killed it
[0:37:30] fatalqwerty: with their bad business practices and decisions
[0:37:33] meIIerr: tbf I was at the LEC studio during this weekend. Riot is trying to kill the hype arround KC qnd everything
[0:37:41] otaf3: stopped watched since clg donezzo
[0:37:41] GingerBeardJo: lcs was dead the second Dyrus left
[0:37:45] awoogawooogawoo: LUL
[0:37:46] DilfZaddy: should NA get buffed for worlds?
[0:37:46] ogoaxe: LCS is suffering from stage 4 of irrelevancy, no going back
[0:37:48] Imaslapyou: LCS is Jesus
[0:37:50] bombpipeule: LMFAO
[0:37:53] bombpipeule: this monte guy
[0:37:55] DixMX: @meIIerr how bro?
[0:37:58] colonelsoap: WUT
[0:37:59] fatalqwerty: Yordhole Kreygasm
[0:38:07] VehementPhoenix: Korean fellatio enthusiast gooner perspective
[0:38:07] JakeJr: Big true
[0:38:08] godhead7777: TRUE
[0:38:09] awoogawooogawoo: true i stop watching since last year
[0:38:10] Wolfmanmoore: LCS is just abd
[0:38:10] najafan: @iSmurfyy They had a chance to expand it during the pandemic but made it worse instead.
[0:38:11] Goatsguffle: we can laugh while watching lcs
[0:38:13] Wolfmanmoore: nad
[0:38:14] silus_tv: did you see tsm has 9 employees
[0:38:15] Wolfmanmoore: BAD
[0:38:19] Phaetox: Bro I gave up on lcs in 2013
[0:38:22] axelerator: I almost forgot LCS had 8 teams
[0:38:23] garry_leonard: LCS is like hoping the lions will make it to the super bowl
[0:38:25] ajollymate: in your opinion, what makes lck players go to lpl like croco?
[0:38:31] najafan: Can y'all remember just how bad pandemic era LCS was?
[0:38:31] meIIerr: not much seats, screen are too hight, the atmosphere is great for non hard fans, but they should scale up now
[0:38:37] godhead7777: im still a g2 believer coper peepoSad
[0:38:38] najafan: It got sooooooo much worse.
[0:38:44] mrcdt: Just praying NA can randomly take games from EU at msi
[0:38:48] rhjf: not a dis on travis, but lcs is so dead hotline league only 560 viewers atm, use to get 3k
[0:38:58] DilfZaddy: do you think NA would have a shot at worlds if they could field 6 players?
[0:39:11] fatalqwerty: Wow, who knew Regi saying "This will be NA's year" from 2012 to 2016 wasn't the solution to NA's declining skill and quality as a product
[0:39:11] oODemonPandaOo: thoughts on Rekkles performances on T1 academy?
[0:39:13] EmailmanLOL: I mean if someone paid me 6 figures to play league I would play anywhere
[0:39:14] blackbeam: HOLY
[0:39:16] meIIerr: when I see lucian milio in lpl
[0:39:18] VehementPhoenix: fuck me elk
[0:39:18] DixMX: @rhjf maybe people realized he's hot garbage
[0:39:22] meIIerr: there is a big difference ngl xD
[0:39:22] ogoaxe: LPL Lucian PogUU
[0:39:29] Rysikoss: Rysikoss subscribed with Prime. 
[0:39:31] Badseed31: Elk said who you bluffing?
[0:39:40] Komarimasita: hmm so this is how lucian is supposed to be played
[0:39:41] Novensiles: I suspect BLG may win this one
[0:39:50] Rumblextristana: It feels weird for chinese teams to import weak KR players instead of growing home grown talent.
[0:39:51] lou_saso: do you think zeka is the weak link on HLE?
[0:39:53] rhjf: @DixMX not wrong
[0:39:57] mrcdt: Top half LCK and LPL is a whole different game
[0:40:01] archie7497: It's so hilarious when the nalcs fans talk about improving viewership when it literally just people like biano with his 30k brazillians and caedrel with his 30k europeans boosting the numbers
[0:40:08] blackbeam: man he's just so good
[0:40:14] najafan: Also, C9 was going to play in LCK Winter back in like S4/S5, iirc, and then riot canceled LCK Winter, so we can blame riot for everything.

[0:40:22] Komarimasita: i thought elk was the 2nd best lpl adc last year and hes taking off im excited
[0:40:24] axelerator: remember when Deft and Imp were crushing the LPL
[0:40:41] oODemonPandaOo: @MonteCristo thoughts on Rekkles performances on T1 academy?
[0:40:43] meIIerr: isn't hope a korean adc ?
[0:40:50] meIIerr: like supposed to be the next uzi or something like that
[0:40:50] aoersie: This game looks beyond over
[0:40:56] Komarimasita: unfortunately i cant look at ON the same way after that blitz play at worlds
[0:41:01] najafan: No chance for NA to improve when 7/10 of the teams are always dogshit every split.
[0:41:02] fatalqwerty: Yeah Monte what's the logic as to why LPL teams import unknown korean players instead of shopping for good ro semi-known ones? Are they just hedging their bets and hoping Challenger Player No. 1321 is gonna be the next TheShy?
[0:41:08] najafan: In the best case.
[0:41:14] Badseed31: I dont think lulu even had enough mana for one shield.
[0:41:23] EmailmanLOL: idk why adcs are still testing elks skill. he’s shown he’s top tier and can back it up
[0:41:28] Novensiles: he's korean he must be good
[0:41:44] DixMX: maybe AL really loves Croco, and Croco really loves China Kappa
[0:41:46] meIIerr: tbf the 2 koreans system worked too well. The only worlds china won, are with koreans
[0:41:47] EmailmanLOL: still waiting on the Thanatos signing from any team
[0:41:47] blackbeam: i like the way xun plays alot
[0:41:50] GingerBeardJo: just the way i like it
[0:41:52] najafan: They confused him with Coco, and felt that Coco didn't get a fair chance in his pro career.
[0:42:06] archie7497: The vicla import is the most outrageous one
[0:42:12] UpYerArs: @MonteCristo do you think Yamato and KC ruined their legacy by NOT being the first team to go 0-9? Personally I think thats selfish
[0:42:22] fatalqwerty: Xun is how I see myself playing when I jungle before the game starts but I always end up as more like Bo
[0:42:33] OvtForeverFall: teams need to hit a minimum money spend, and poor teams don't want to pay their rookies more, so they just import some random Korean
[0:42:55] WaXMaXter: Vicla in his job interview: "I took a hiatus last year"
[0:43:05] VehementPhoenix: We will be talking about BLG in 6 months.
[0:43:06] Imaslapyou: huh
[0:43:10] Imaslapyou: LUL
[0:43:10] murksquad912: murksquad912 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to MonteCristo's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:43:11] murksquad912: murksquad912 gifted a Tier 1 sub to nipplePICLE! 
[0:43:12] SaltineCracker94: HUH
[0:43:18] awoogawooogawoo: HUH
[0:43:18] fatalqwerty: Zeri getting bent over and punished monkaHmm uhmm... Yordhole?
[0:43:18] KorlackJ: are you horny recently monte?
[0:43:20] blackbeam: that's some of my favorite artwork yes
[0:43:25] meIIerr: can we talka bout the fact that udyr won lane agains't rumble, and in europe no one knows how to play udyr ?
[0:43:46] aoersie: @meiierr Wunder did really well today
[0:43:46] brandofan2: i think AL will be good this year
[0:43:46] Rumblextristana: I wouldnt be surprised if a low tier chinese team imports Taeyoon even though he was bad on kwangdong
[0:43:53] deadpoool04: wunder did good on udyr tho ?
[0:43:56] najafan: Sometimes a cigar is only a cigar.
[0:44:00] meIIerr: well clearly not enough tbh
[0:44:05] meIIerr: again perkz inted
[0:44:06] blackbeam: chat reflects the streamer PepePls
[0:44:17] godhead7777: i turned ur stream down to 720p so the game looks normal now xdd
[0:44:30] meIIerr: btw monte, fnatic vs g2 was fun
[0:44:35] colonelsoap: already more kills than in an entire LCK game on average
[0:44:35] aoersie: Si
[0:44:37] ogoaxe: @godhead7777 modern problems require modern solutions
[0:44:37] Komarimasita: whatever happened to Zoom i remember he was all the rage a few years ago
[0:44:52] blackbeam: k-knight?
[0:44:54] Novensiles: yea that was questionable
[0:44:59] Novensiles: at best
[0:44:59] colonelsoap: knight....
[0:45:01] HorsezPwn42: bo would
[0:45:10] aoersie: @meiierr he couldn't solo win the game, what a shocker
[0:45:17] DixMX: he was probably hoping to one shot someone
[0:45:17] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:45:20] VehementPhoenix: Knight should flame the rest of his team for no-balls obviously
[0:45:20] meIIerr: this lucian is putting work
[0:45:21] blackbeam: i think the caster just said something like "that play gave me a headache" LUL
[0:45:31] fatalqwerty: What is Hery doing?!? LUL
[0:45:43] awoogawooogawoo: LUL
[0:45:47] DixMX: LUL
[0:45:50] Novensiles: game 1 must not've been a banger
[0:46:06] blackbeam: oh my god elk's damage is wild
[0:46:10] kraethan: Oh i just thought i missed game 1 lol
[0:46:11] najafan: Probably because G1 was the one that started 15 minutes in, lol
[0:46:33] murksquad912: I’ve watched like 100 games of LoL and even bet on it and have 0 clue what’s happening. I just look at the kills, towers and gold. The announcers are so hype.
[0:46:42] rhjf: bin and hery got to look at each other alot this game but didnt do much else
[0:47:31] ogoaxe: If you don't find a 1080p on lolqq, I found a 1080p  Game 1 on Huya. Can share link if needed
[0:47:33] fatalqwerty: Dota just... i dunno if I have boomer eyes but I cant see jackshit when something goes on in Dota
[0:47:37] SomeFerretGuy: I love watching dota, have never actually played it though
[0:47:46] VehementPhoenix: Back in my day we were grateful for 720p
[0:48:03] OvtForeverFall: I think there's 1080p on bilibili
[0:48:05] Novensiles: its rough to start dota after thousands of hours of LoL, shit like character turning
[0:48:07] brandofan2: im glad kael isnt stuck on FearX at least
[0:48:15] SwyrOo: cant wait for KC to stomp BLG at MSI
[0:48:17] DixMX: what a stomp
[0:48:18] KorlackJ: i feel like knight did that flash play on purpose to get adc mid flash just so they could end the game faster
[0:48:30] SoulSnorlax: CoolCat
[0:49:07] meIIerr: feels like teams playing agains't them need to be able to put pressure on one of the 3 lanes, but they just get utter stomped in lane, and the deficit start from the plates gold
[0:49:07] ogoaxe: Can't either, just got an addon translator. Does a decent job
[0:49:13] blackbeam: BASED
[0:49:16] ogoaxe: ***
[0:49:20] SomeFerretGuy: Do you have time to consume league shoulder content with your absurdly full vods schedule? specifically did you catch Emily talking to umti, huhi and Olleh?
[0:49:21] carnivalnights: This is the only channel where I'm safe from the low quality of the LCS.
[0:49:32] ogoaxe: Sorry, my bad
[0:49:36] PinnxelGRP: our eyes can only see 30 frames a second so there is no difference between 1080p and 720p
[0:49:48] fatalqwerty: If Monte allows link posting, it's like breaking the dam LUL
[0:49:48] SwyrOo: @carnivalnights you do realize hes about to watch a KC game
[0:49:49] OvtForeverFall: @PinnxelGRP ?
[0:49:51] UpYerArs: @carnivalnights but not safe from LEC
[0:49:55] SomeFerretGuy: it was awesome, they had good vibes
[0:49:57] phinvincible: oh wow thats much better
[0:50:00] najafan: Some of us actually have link perms though.
[0:50:00] DixMX: the Pros segment after LCS is so fun
[0:50:06] carnivalnights: LEC at least make it out of groups tbf.
[0:50:11] blackbeam: absolute gigachad
[0:50:23] jayhow24: is there a rule that they can’t ff at 20? Or do teams just try to pretend not to int if they are losing

[0:50:25] SomeFerretGuy: @carnivalnights not this year brother
[0:50:26] AzureCatalyst: low key Chinese video sites are miles ahead of YouTube Voss
[0:50:27] DixMX: PogChamp
[0:50:33] DrakeAcula: EZ
[0:50:34] PinnxelGRP: @carnivalnights they didnt last year tho LUL only LCS did
[0:50:41] mjoll_the_hotness: its whole new world now
[0:50:42] awoogawooogawoo: @ogoaxe least informative monte viewer CHAD
[0:50:45] Birbmang_: Do you think vanguard coming to league is going to shrink the playerbase even more as people don't want their data going directly to the Chinese govermenment?
[0:50:46] AzureCatalyst: I watched the worlds games on Bilibili last year and they were fantastic
[0:50:58] carnivalnights: Can we just go back to shitting on LCS? I don't watch LEC enough to dumpster on them.
[0:51:06] DixMX: @AzureCatalyst remember when people could customize their YouTube channels with banners and shit?
[0:51:21] bombpipeule: its look good  Monte
[0:51:25] blackbeam: this looks pretty official
[0:51:26] fatalqwerty: MY EYES!! It burns.... monkaW
[0:51:35] eck1e: Has Zeri just entered comfort tier for adc that she will be around even when she isn't that strong?
[0:51:45] UpYerArs: is your cam upside down or what
[0:51:57] SomeFerretGuy: ? no
[0:52:01] PinnxelGRP: Live streaming and consumption by minors is prohibited monkaW
[0:52:10] SomeFerretGuy: are you in austrailia @UpYerArs
[0:52:13] AzureCatalyst: he’s an Aussie viewer don’t worry about him
[0:52:17] najafan: @Birbmang_ Well, you know, there are quite a few people on tiktok
[0:52:17] bombpipeule: LOL
[0:52:18] EmailmanLOL: yeah something like that
[0:52:21] UpYerArs: nvm im too high
[0:52:29] AzureCatalyst: lmfao
[0:52:39] AzureCatalyst: too high for bangers only
[0:52:44] jayhow24: is there a rule that they can’t ff at 20? Or do teams just try to pretend not to int if they are losing
[0:52:46] Birbmang_: @Birbmang_ Yeah but the lol playerbase is already older and not the same generation that is on tiktok
[0:52:49] blackbeam: LMFAO
[0:52:54] fatalqwerty: oh wow china crowd also has a lot of cuties why cant NA and EU be like this
[0:52:54] Birbmang_: i know i'm uninstalling when it comes
[0:53:02] SqueektheWeek: dood flew so high he came back upside from the other side of the world
[0:53:06] najafan: Just get a mac
[0:53:09] djdoovid: Is freezepipe still sponsoring LFN?
[0:53:11] awoogawooogawoo: can you use green thing on korea or you get deported?
[0:53:13] mjoll_the_hotness: your hands can ff at 20
[0:53:13] najafan: They said they won't require it for a mac
[0:53:15] SoulSnorlax: which lec can beat blg?
[0:53:17] lamir1021: im surprised that dota still allows teams to ff
[0:53:29] PinnxelGRP: This is just a Perkz waiting room, his Azir play today rivaled Zeka's Corki
[0:53:36] Birbmang_: @lamir1021 you have clearly never watched dota then
[0:53:37] UpYerArs: @AzureCatalyst i need it for the abomination of the lec thats going to come afterwards
[0:53:37] fatalqwerty: oh wow Kindred!
[0:53:43] fatalqwerty: oh no he didnt pick kindred FeelsBadMan
[0:54:00] SomeFerretGuy: perkz play today is how I learned that lec twitch channel auto deletes the word 'washed'
[0:54:07] lamir1021: @lamir1021 ive watched dota for awhile but since league changed it from a long time ago im surprised they didnt
[0:54:25] najafan: The riot channels are VERY heavily manages
[0:54:29] najafan: managed*
[0:54:31] flaminghito: the volume meter is like "oh we getting high in here? don't mind if I do"
[0:54:56] blackbeam: ROFL
[0:54:58] VehementPhoenix: Dom about to be triggered by this Udyr lvl 1
[0:55:00] Krethas: at this point you might just want to turn down your browser volume if every vod resets it to too high
[0:55:07] AzureCatalyst: that is so funny
[0:55:07] archie7497: @someferretguy no fucking way lmao. Did they actually
[0:55:09] najafan: I think they were deleting the word "tree" for a while.
[0:55:12] SoulSnorlax: Can Heretics beat BLG?
[0:55:21] mjoll_the_hotness: perkz will be a great coach no worries
[0:55:21] fatalqwerty: im starting to feel like you'll have to lower your browser's volume with the volume mixer if huya resets the volume every time you scrub through the video
[0:55:33] SomeFerretGuy: yeah I was sending the famous pasta-- my ryze is bad /my azir is worse /you guessed it right /I'm washed up perkz
[0:55:33] Siraon: @MonteCristo set the max volume down in windows volume mixer
[0:55:33] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:55:36] hallbringer: tbh i came here from youtube
[0:55:37] HorsezPwn42: KC beats BLG tho
[0:55:40] ogoaxe: If you food poison BLG, then maybe
[0:55:44] PinnxelGRP: BLG GENG T1
[0:55:58] halfcena: solo lanes of BIn and Knight are scary
[0:56:01] mudboy: xun <3
[0:56:04] najafan: BLG, GENG, T1, KC
[0:56:05] Rumblextristana: @MonteCristo Who do you think is the 2nd best lpl team?
[0:56:05] SoulSnorlax: JDG looks lots weaker
[0:56:08] AzureCatalyst: I still have Gen.G as my top 2 in the world til I see Canyon and Lehends do some nonsense
[0:56:09] najafan: You forgot one
[0:56:15] UpYerArs: t1 stans coming for your throat
[0:56:25] AzureCatalyst: JDG without Knight and 369 is actually so different
[0:56:41] SoulSnorlax: yeah
[0:56:42] AzureCatalyst: like those two did some much to define their team fighting identity
[0:57:01] fatalqwerty: Heretics can beat BLG if they played in EU servers with BLG having 250 ping and even then it'll still be a close series Kappa
[0:57:09] HorsezPwn42: @najafan KC a little low there
[0:57:17] eck1e: @AzureCatalyst Sadly that entire team has the capability of soiling themselves when the lights are bright. I'd love for them to prove me wrong, but I've been burned far too many times
[0:57:23] DixMX: @AzureCatalyst but twitter and reddit told me that Knight is shit Kappa
[0:57:26] SomeFerretGuy: @hallbringer I was browsing for something to waste time and saw monte was live on yt too.
[0:57:26] PinnxelGRP: @fatalqwerty I don't think Knight would ever lose to Perkz even on 250 ping
[0:57:29] AzureCatalyst: even though ruler and missing and kanavi are the same Yagao and sheer are completely different from 369 and knight in terms of map pressure and roles
[0:57:45] 999999779: is it on huya?
[0:57:51] Crushzilla: looks better than most lcs broadcasts
[0:58:03] charcoalsalesman: Narator: The vod wasn't sharp
[0:58:04] 999999779: huya is great ye
[0:58:17] najafan: @HorsezPwn42 It's not a sorted list.
[0:58:28] Shriez: and Hope has Barrier
[0:58:35] OvtForeverFall: does't feel very stable, or is that only me
[0:58:50] HorsezPwn42: mb
[0:58:53] AzureCatalyst: @eck1e the only two players who remain from tbe prior gen g rosters are Peyz and Chovy. I do think a lot of their international faltering did come from their shotxallers and Doran. now that peanut and Doran are gone I don’t know if I consider them the same team as previous gen.g iterations
[0:58:54] HpRking: i thought all lucians go ignite. i copied it from one of the lpl adcs
[0:59:03] Phaetox: Back in my day the adc always took ignite
[0:59:03] Badseed31: He probably feels extremely comfortable in this matchup
[0:59:05] Shriez: it's surprising to me, so used to seeing Heal or Ghost on adcs
[0:59:15] ProdigalChicken: its the first strike synegry and specific to milio nami pairing
[0:59:23] DixMX: Knight's Syndra is so good
[0:59:26] awoogawooogawoo: Have you tried asking kick for sponsorship?
[0:59:27] Phaetox: Cant let those pesky supports ks
[0:59:36] mjoll_the_hotness: having peanut as your jungler in the current year will 100% not give you world championship
[0:59:38] bombpipeule: Lucian is typical with  ignite guys
[0:59:42] SomeFerretGuy: what's your connection like in korea? back here in the states I get 900/20 from comcast LuL
[0:59:44] PinnxelGRP: @AzureCatalyst Chovy was also pretty garbo. He was choking last MSI to Yagao
[0:59:45] DixMX: don't forget Bjergsen
[1:00:01] djdoovid: Showmaker has been insane this season
[1:00:02] fatalqwerty: What about Bjergsen Syndra? Kappa NA stomper
[1:00:03] EmailmanLOL: Angel
[1:00:04] Fortune49: bjerg syndra KEKW
[1:00:06] Phaetox: I've seen it on lucian mid
[1:00:10] bombpipeule: I meant in general  Monte..
[1:00:26] flaminghito: Does Revitalize work on Summoner Heal? That would make sense for why you put it on the supp
[1:00:33] eck1e: @AzureCatalyst That's fair
[1:00:33] Midnightsgrin: Is us watching on twitch or youtube more beneficial for you?

[1:00:34] bombpipeule: lucian ignite is not rare.  compared to other ADC
[1:00:35] Quint_5s: how good was bjergsen on his peak?
[1:00:37] Fortune49: durex sponsor??
[1:00:44] Komarimasita: the cull on tristana into a syndra seems brave
[1:00:51] SomeFerretGuy: yes players in the lpl fuck
[1:00:52] HpRking: can you check if it is only with milio and not nami
[1:00:57] Exp3ct: it's cause milio would never get in range to ignite
[1:00:58] Badseed31: @Fortune49 gotta stay safe
[1:00:59] AzureCatalyst: @pinnxelgrp if you think Chovy is Garbo from solely international play, then I have two players you must think are shit. Namei and Knight and Kiin
[1:01:05] PinnxelGRP: @Quint_5s He was better than peak Faker I fear
[1:01:10] AzureCatalyst: three including Kiin
[1:01:16] Goatsguffle: yeah because most of their workforce is like 40 or above
[1:01:18] oMrGo: Why have ignite on AD and heal on support?
[1:01:18] EmailmanLOL: they don’t want more gamers tho
[1:01:21] eck1e: Have lots of sex, but safe sex brought to you by Durex
[1:01:23] Vailyon: they jsut poke holes in them
[1:01:23] bestplat_tftplayer: he does whatever he wants
[1:01:27] GelatoSquid: Xi xin ping wants them to have babies but also complains about young people not working enough LUL
[1:01:41] AzureCatalyst: I mean Kiin lost to C9 at worlds so he must be shit right?
[1:01:41] najafan: That's because of demographics, not much this ad will change
[1:01:41] PinnxelGRP: @AzureCatalyst I didn't say that, he goes missing in international play often
[1:01:43] aoersie: Maybe they only sell lube
[1:01:46] djdoovid: I guess the first step is to get people to have more sex in general?
[1:01:49] DixMX: gamers, the most oppressed minority
[1:02:25] najafan: We should just offer green cards to all the Chinese women who come to the US to study to make the problem worse. :)
[1:02:31] jayhow24: So is it time for a semi dry chicken sandwich?
[1:02:47] xChip102: xChip102 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 90 months! 
[1:02:47] flaminghito: @jayhow24 is this durex's motto
[1:02:51] SoulSnorlax: oh nice
[1:03:05] xChip102: never leaving
[1:03:05] SomeFerretGuy: holy
[1:03:18] SomeFerretGuy: is chip your longest sub
[1:03:18] najafan: Fun fact, did you know Mao offered Kissinger 10 million Chinese women?
[1:03:39] DixMX: @najafan I would've accepted
[1:03:39] xChip102: @SomeFerretGuy I'd assume no
[1:03:40] awoogawooogawoo: you need a 7 year sub badge
[1:03:40] jayhow24: @flaminghito this is the way
[1:03:50] najafan: Think about how bad we could have crippled China had Kissinger accepted.
[1:03:55] Dzy3D: xun so clean
[1:03:57] AzureCatalyst: 90 months Jesus
[1:04:11] SomeFerretGuy: dayum
[1:04:18] awoogawooogawoo: wait there 9 year subs?
[1:04:21] Wolfofthefallen: 10 years of greatness
[1:04:25] bangbingpoww: thoughts on the upcoming bo3s in LEC? especially Fnatic v MAD?
[1:04:26] ProdigalChicken: Pog
[1:04:30] Bliven: real question is, is there anyone that close?
[1:04:32] Komarimasita: ten year? or tenure
[1:04:40] oMrGo: Imagine BLG vs GENG holy
[1:04:43] SomeFerretGuy: I have 94 months to a path of exile streamer
[1:04:48] Jeffp2662: wasn’t there 100 month the other day
[1:04:50] AzureCatalyst: I just finished rowing at the gym and did my dumbbells woop woop time to watch Bangers only with the boys
[1:04:53] Bliven: I mean 7.5 years is a lot
[1:04:54] SqueektheWeek: in september I will have followed for 9 years
[1:05:02] najafan: @DixMX I mean, same. But also from the realpolitik angle, since the OCP has crippled them.
[1:05:04] SoulSnorlax: what about JDG

[1:11:09] Bliven: LUL
[1:11:13] oMrGo: not EUM over LCS?
[1:11:13] SqueektheWeek: that someone had to ask when LCK is clearly the answer, do you even watch monte?
[1:11:13] PinnxelGRP: name 3 teams in the turkish league right now
[1:11:14] Clyde1500: imagine asking the korean fellatio enthusiast his favorite region.
[1:11:15] SomeFerretGuy: where was brasil in there

[1:11:18] VehementPhoenix: What about C9? :(
[1:11:18] QuackTheDuck: LCK challengers? Did u see rekkless playing? Pog
[1:11:20] wrann_d: bullshit, no one watches the turkish league who's not from turkey.
[1:11:21] MoldyCalzone: Wait, that would imply someone watches LCS KEKW
[1:11:24] bombpipeule: LOL
[1:11:26] FumaK0tar0: so we watch t1 academy instead of c9?
[1:11:28] najafan: LCS > ERLS confirmed
[1:11:29] bombpipeule: Monte shameless
[1:11:29] Wolfofthefallen: LCS still too high honestly
[1:11:32] ogoaxe: Isn't LJL better than NA Kappa
[1:11:32] SomeFerretGuy: I didn't hear cblol
[1:11:41] jayhow24: do you think they would ever draft what dragon/baron’s spawn?
[1:11:42] QuackTheDuck: LCS is 4th Kappa
[1:11:43] PinnxelGRP: as we rightfully should be
[1:11:44] Zoogs: Overwatch then LCS lol
[1:11:45] carnivalnights: I'd rather watch LCO than LCS.
[1:11:54] QuackTheDuck: I wish LCS was 4th
[1:12:07] SqueektheWeek: LCS is like the bitter note to offset the rest of the delicious leagues
[1:12:34] bestplat_tftplayer: i cant believe zeri is still playable in pro play even after all those nerfs
[1:12:43] najafan: LCS/CBLOL conferences for an Americas league might actually be interesting.
[1:13:12] friskybusinesses: there should be an americas cup for north and south america and carribean
[1:13:14] QuackTheDuck: Wait the drakes are pre generated?
[1:13:31] friskybusinesses: this was the game that made me more skeptical
[1:13:40] friskybusinesses: not effective enough early game
[1:13:51] hhodaie: maybe you could see lesser played champs that excel with a certain soul too?
[1:13:57] Rumblextristana: Tbf I haven't seen a whole lot of zeri in pro play
[1:13:59] QuackTheDuck: If the game knows why not just tell us that just seems like more rng for no reason
[1:13:59] Jeffp2662: milio took blue lol
[1:14:02] saltywalty1337: @MonteCristo do you ever sleep lol
[1:14:11] Komarimasita: thats why your loading screens are so long, a rioter is spinning a drake wheel before every game

[1:16:05] Rikh: illegal rumble gameplay
[1:16:06] molicious1: imagine best of 3 when each team could veto 1 dragon soul type, pick 1 each, then game 3 is the final soul leftover
[1:16:06] ggscotty: How are you handling the Twitch changes?
[1:16:08] whatevveeer: @carnivalnights yes and no, no against Ruler, yes against other domestic players
[1:16:13] QuackTheDuck: Classic Zeri
[1:16:22] MissingMatter: Both good ideas.
[1:16:29] PinnxelGRP: I dont watch egirls, I prefer the company of men
[1:16:33] makancheeze: do your kids have dual citizenship?
[1:16:34] kerokerogrips: does dom count as the already a millionaire ?
[1:16:35] lvlutedheretic: does doa count as an "egirl"?

[1:16:48] fatalqwerty: NOTICE ME SENPAI BibleThump
[1:16:50] bombpipeule: WutFace
[1:16:51] Lady_Michaelis: Monte always notices you !
[1:16:53] SqueektheWeek: monte I heard its uncommon to Koreans to take leftovers from restaurants due to the communal eating of banchan, was curious how common that is
[1:16:54] Flaptasticpickle: notice me Monte
[1:16:57] Warzard908: Certified Zeri Moment
[1:16:58] kerokerogrips: even with all the crack dom buys ?
[1:17:03] Imaslapyou: Monte is our parasocial choice, chat.
[1:17:04] Jeffp2662: did Lucian just e in to flash out?
[1:17:05] najafan: LS reads my name but refuses to read my message. It's very hurtful.
[1:17:06] VehementPhoenix: I gave my sub to LFN, is that okay?
[1:17:14] bombpipeule: @Flaptasticpickle  monkaS
[1:17:14] ogoaxe: @kerokerogrips crack's cheap, he good
[1:17:19] carnivalnights: Would you rather we support this channel with a sub or one of the LFN network of podcasts?
[1:17:25] PinnxelGRP: Are korean portions smaller?
[1:17:38] Komarimasita: you dont do that in japan either, they need a special license to allow you to take food and it's not looked upon favorably
[1:17:41] garmvup: garmvup subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:17:46] 999999779: yeah same here
[1:17:46] QuackTheDuck: Yeah the portions I feel are way smaller than in america
[1:17:56] tylerfromtaylorstreet: Hey @MonteCristo, do you think if the regions had more balanced formats the west would be more competitive? Seems weird that LPL and LCK teams play 3x as many games.
[1:17:57] SqueektheWeek: the more I know
[1:17:59] MissingMatter: Doesn't like restaurant's food enough to take it home.
[1:18:06] bestplat_tftplayer: i like 3 meal version :) :)
[1:18:07] PinnxelGRP: you get less food for your money? Massive Korean L
[1:18:12] najafan: @tylerfromtaylorstreet We tried that. It killed LCS
[1:18:15] whatevveeer: Can't you ask for bigger portion?
[1:18:15] Sjkaev: american food portions are ridiculous
[1:18:27] ggscotty: In Northern Virginia, there's a ton of KBBQ places, never been though
[1:18:44] brandofan2: you spend hours setting up to the studio to play a 20minute stomp
[1:18:45] Phaetox: They need more games vs better teams, not just more games vs each other though
[1:18:49] Zoogs: I have a friend that loves the amount of food given but I'm more interested in quality.
[1:18:55] QuackTheDuck: Make up?
[1:19:02] fatalqwerty: at least NA players look better when losing Kappa
[1:19:03] QuackTheDuck: Pro players wear makeup?
[1:19:05] ItzShade10: hi is this the first game ur watching today @MonteCristo
[1:19:11] najafan: @ItzShade10 2nd
[1:19:12] tylerfromtaylorstreet: @najafan But didn't EU win MSI/ go to back 2 back finals with same format as the east.
[1:19:15] archie7497: Didn't blg play something like 150 games last year including lpl demicia cup msi worlds
[1:19:15] Double_Hitt: @QuackTheDuck of course, lighting etc
[1:19:17] flaminghito: I feel like G2 does well or poorly owing to some inscrutable internal logic unrelated to practice and the gap for any other western team is just so big format nonwithstanding
[1:19:19] ItzShade10: @ItzShade10 what did he watch before this
[1:19:26] halfcena: in auckland, you cant even take food home from kbbq's and you get fined like $10 for taking more than you eat
[1:19:27] carnivalnights: @QuackTheDuck If they don't, they're gonna be sweating all over the damn place. Shiny faces on cameras.
[1:19:28] fatalqwerty: Best of 2 because that's how football does it Kappa
[1:19:30] KMTlol: @tylerfromtaylorstreet its hard to answer short, but yes. LCS players lose so much practice time playing those bo1s. Same with LEC, 3 days gone from practice
[1:19:33] najafan: @tylerfromtaylorstreet Different format, and people kvetched about the format constantly.
[1:19:34] kerokerogrips: then why on earth do western leagues still do bo1
[1:19:36] SomeFerretGuy: he watched game 2 LuL
[1:19:36] Bliven: @ItzShade10 game 2 of this series LUL
[1:19:38] ItzShade10: thanks
[1:19:43] jayhow24: or there could be a fluke drag/baron
[1:19:47] najafan: EU was bo2
[1:19:53] najafan: NA was bo3
[1:19:59] najafan: And they were at different times.
[1:20:04] VehementPhoenix: The problem with LCS BO1 is garbo teams. I refuse to watch that. Fict he thea pls MarkZ (it wont happen)
[1:20:11] Komarimasita: i can see why the zeri was picked in game 2, after watching game 2 first i was thinking "i can't believe they ran it back"
[1:20:25] fatalqwerty: that's why NA played like virgin pussies that dont wanna do anything proactively and it transfers to international play
[1:20:27] PinnxelGRP: well guys, EU moved to more series last year and they failed to make it out of groups while getting stomped by NA. Make of that what you will.
[1:20:32] najafan: And people kvetched *constantly* about bo2s.
[1:20:32] Darkraging: And it's done over a single patch
[1:20:36] fatalqwerty: that's why teams like C9 stood out circa 2013-2015
[1:20:39] bestplat_tftplayer: and it is less enjoyable to watch
[1:20:39] najafan: bo2s are, imo, the better format.
[1:20:48] najafan: But people HATED it.
[1:20:52] PinnxelGRP: Tencent volume increase remotely monkaW
[1:20:57] bombpipeule: we might get a game 3 :o
[1:20:58] QuackTheDuck: Yreah just look at RGE they literally are scared to do anything
[1:21:05] archie7497: Imagine lcs playing 14 bo1 over six weeks. How cringe is that
[1:21:05] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:21:15] flaminghito: @najafan the people demand unambiguous endings it's why we keep getting Marvel movies
[1:21:21] Sjkaev: @MonteCristo bo1s also takes away the "comeback/clutch factor a team/player might have" narative
[1:21:22] archie7497: Oh wait that's just reality
[1:21:24] FumaK0tar0: do you think lec is setting up a more bo3 centered format in the following years after the changes last year ?
[1:21:42] DixMX: @archie7497 28 games in 8 months if you are last both splits :D
[1:21:53] kerokerogrips: why did LEC move to 18+ for rosters and not get 18+ sponsers ????
[1:21:56] jayhow24: I guess I can’t wrap my head around not wanting more strategy around drafts knowing what the drag/baron would be. It would be expand the champion pool
[1:21:59] najafan: @flaminghito I really wish Oppenheimer looked in the camera and said he renounced communism, he was now a liberal, and that he was exactly the same type of liberal that I am.
[1:22:13] GelatoSquid: tbf, imagine trying to watch every single NFL game when they're all on differernt services LUL
[1:22:16] Zoogs: Ruck Fiot
[1:22:19] bestplat_tftplayer: how hard is it just to put it on youtube
[1:22:30] SomeFerretGuy: @flaminghito wat
[1:22:32] bestplat_tftplayer: riot tards
[1:22:48] Sjkaev: LUL
[1:22:49] bestplat_tftplayer: true lol
[1:22:49] fatalqwerty: an intern can upload stuff on youtube ResidentSleeper
[1:22:51] fernysilva19: oof
[1:22:54] najafan: @SomeFerretGuy Have you not seen the Oppenheimer communist jokes? smh
[1:22:56] archie7497: @kerokerogrips yeah I forgot about that change. Weren't they getting a betting sponsor?
[1:22:58] VehementPhoenix: Easy, just not within Riot's fucking objectives or whatever
[1:23:08] SomeFerretGuy: I uhhh haven't
[1:23:08] ctrain46: they lost the 'share to youtube' button at rito
[1:23:13] DixMX: someone should make a fansite for all vods
[1:23:17] bestplat_tftplayer: they should hire me as intern with min pay
[1:23:19] fatalqwerty: It boggles my mind how Riot just seems to shoot themselves at the foot at ever step of the way
[1:23:23] kerokerogrips: @archie7497 no clue hence me asking monte if he knew what was up with that seemed so random for the lec to do that
[1:23:35] PinnxelGRP: oh yeah since Riot fired like half the LEC crew or something would you still say they make a lot of money off of esports
[1:23:36] SomeFerretGuy: riot has succeeded DESPITE themself not because of any decision they've made
[1:23:39] ItzShade10: damn this site sucks
[1:23:58] DixMX: read the comments below Kappa
[1:23:59] ItzShade10: yeah the buffering
[1:24:05] Zizonyx: kiittwSmile
[1:24:06] kerokerogrips: if your praise XI jingping into your huawei mic the site will work better
[1:24:08] najafan: @SomeFerretGuy *** *** etc etc

[1:24:17] janibuh: janibuh subscribed with Prime. 
[1:24:21] icefairychiruno: What's wrong with the Chinese Youtube upload, is it worse?
[1:24:30] bestplat_tftplayer: social credit score dropping
[1:24:48] ItzShade10: yeah looks great
[1:24:51] Zoogs: @MonteCristo Can you give us your opinion on Riot's future given they squelch good content creativity?
[1:24:52] Sjkaev: does have nice quality
[1:25:00] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Do you think Tencent forces Riot to not allow the games on English platforms to make it harder to scout the Chinese teams?  Wouldn't be the first time the scaled got thumbed for Chinese teams (play at home on a ping delay for a tournament?)
[1:25:01] najafan: Original one is this one ***
[1:25:15] bestplat_tftplayer: maybe lower the quality
[1:25:25] archie7497: @montecristo might be easier to just watch Doms vod
[1:25:32] mehits: you need a high social credit score for no buffering
[1:25:35] virtuoso_blades: that’s probably why it has longer buffering cause the byte rate and HD quality @montecristo
[1:25:45] Sjkaev: aww man
[1:25:55] ItzShade10: had a 30min Pause in LEC yesterday over a bug which wasnt actually a bug

[1:27:31] jayhow24: babies are great when they aren’t yours
[1:27:34] SqueektheWeek: babies are easy, they just need you all the time on their time. which is brutal.
[1:27:34] Phaetox: But if you have 3 more you have your own team to coach
[1:27:47] Mykah9: @najafan nope my wife is from the midwest
[1:27:48] najafan: Your poor wife.
[1:27:51] DixMX: do you teach your baby cool tricks?

[1:30:30] Zoogs: @MonteCristo I really appreciated how well you prep for all your "big events." I could definitely see you were set apart from others.
[1:30:33] Komarimasita: i feel like croco must just scream his name in voice comms before every vi ult
[1:30:33] archie7497: @tpro83 is your cousins wife okay?

[1:39:48] DixMX: make an anonymous account and sneak in
[1:39:51] commando1814: why would Travis this it's risky
[1:39:53] SomeFerretGuy: bruh is bin going to live

[1:40:23] SomeFerretGuy: a jellyfish
[1:40:29] DixMX: Bin just running

[1:40:45] MoldyCalzone: Udyr is disgusting
[1:40:46] Sjkaev: this is just illegal haha
[1:40:50] SqueektheWeek: hype train is real
[1:41:00] fatalqwerty: Bin gave them a "call the ambulance, but not for me" on AL
[1:41:00] ItzShade10: is it safe to say BLG are probably the best team in the LPL this year?
[1:41:02] Len_xyz: they needed trist to be there to kill bin imo
[1:41:10] UpYerArs: he's still  going
[1:41:14] QuackTheDuck: Tanks OP
[1:41:17] Badseed31: Some of those tank items are op
[1:41:20] Goatsguffle: why no LDR on zeri?
[1:41:33] archie7497: Did the syndra w really nuke the zeri from 40% hp
[1:41:34] Sjkaev: is the zeri items not well equiped to handle udyr itemization?

[1:41:56] WashedxUp222: Just realized you stream on youtube too! Def like the ability to rewind and FastForward myself
[1:42:04] fatalqwerty: even with all the shred udyr still had 220 armor
[1:42:07] SqueektheWeek: tank items are a bit strong right now
[1:42:14] Warzard908: @garmvup Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:42:18] Shobes572: and Vi w
[1:42:21] PinnxelGRP: Zeri realized she not built for this LUL
[1:42:26] airbrid: LDR for Runanns but trist would've bought it
[1:42:48] War_Wren: randuin's putting in work
[1:42:49] fatalqwerty: Plus randuin also does basic attack damage reduction, I think it would be around -25 attack damage from autos
[1:42:49] svienvt: does zeri still interact with shields? like when she q's steals it? or was that removed
[1:42:51] aoersie: @spaceturtl3 ty for the sub mate <3
[1:42:55] SqueektheWeek: 3v1 turns in to full clean ace
[1:43:12] Goatsguffle: its funny that LCS and LEC suck with udyr and this guy is a fucking god
[1:43:16] Siraon: @MonteCristo have you looked at ons items
[1:43:18] PinnxelGRP: if you need to see Zeri's face just google the "he realized he not built for this" meme LUL
[1:43:20] fatalqwerty: AND randuin also reduces crit damage by around 10-15% iirc?
[1:43:20] QuackTheDuck: @svienvt that sounds broken
[1:43:22] svienvt: would've been helpful now especially now
[1:43:23] Zebrios: I think all ADCs should have at least one major armor pen item.  Like 80% of the time they're forced to hit tanks anyways.
[1:43:26] GelatoSquid: unkillable udyr is the bane of solo q
[1:43:26] airbrid: You think Vayne has a spot or is a theoretical answer top to Udyr?
[1:43:33] DixMX: BLG is set for greatness
[1:43:33] svienvt: @QuackTheDuck it was such a nice niche thing about her
[1:43:36] UpYerArs: Oh shit are you going to be streaming on Kick as well?
[1:43:41] DixMX: I hope they don't fall off
[1:43:42] archie7497: ah zeri has no ldr no wonder. Majority of Ldr's damage comes from the giantslayer passive
[1:43:47] kshyle: serpents fang xdd
[1:43:48] Warzard908: ngl sucks zeri doesn't steal shields in this situation
[1:43:50] SomeFerretGuy: fuck kick weirdChamp
[1:43:56] Siraon: he built serpents fang at the end
[1:43:57] Zebrios: Vayne would get eaten
[1:44:04] fatalqwerty: someone tried vayne mid in the west LUL
[1:44:05] fernysilva19: thats game 2 no?
[1:44:05] QuackTheDuck: are you a fun of range tops at all?
[1:44:09] QuackTheDuck: *fan
[1:44:15] Sjkaev: vayne just dies... as much as i wanna see her played
[1:44:20] DixMX: then Quinn? Kappa
[1:44:24] PinnxelGRP: statik shiv runaan tiamat vayne
[1:44:26] thugitakhrushchev: @fatalqwerty that someone lost to a sion mid LUL
[1:44:28] airbrid: Stattik?
[1:44:29] Warzard908: @fatalqwerty we don't talk about it
[1:44:46] UpYerArs: frozen, bramble cripples her
[1:44:49] PinnxelGRP: he will get nerfed soon
[1:44:56] airbrid: Fair fair
[1:44:56] PinnxelGRP: no shot he survives the ban wave
[1:44:58] QuackTheDuck: isnt rumble good into him then because rumble also push fast
[1:44:59] SomeFerretGuy: RaccAttack
[1:45:00] fatalqwerty: wouldn't morde be a good answer to Udyr? He can also shove as hard AND he can take out udyr in team fights
[1:45:04] Sjkaev: kinda like old singed but better
[1:45:06] carnivalnights: Immortals vs Dignitas
[1:45:10] deep8719: Ashe can punish
[1:45:11] schmidtycontent: which region has the best format in your opinion? (including both regular season and playoffs)
[1:45:16] Badseed31: Bwipo proxy with it
[1:45:19] Zoogs: link to poll?
[1:45:26] kshyle: @QuackTheDuck theres like a counter to it somehow dom mentioned it to wunder once
[1:45:26] fatalqwerty: RaccAttack my brethren it's time RaccAttack
[1:45:27] Zebrios: Udyr is also damn near unkillable because he can just run away.  Other wave clearing tanks (like Ornn), can at least be caught out and killed.
[1:45:28] DixMX: @MonteCristo I haven't kept up with Overwatch since the end of OWL, what's happening with the competitive scene?
[1:45:30] SomeFerretGuy: RaccAttack 󠀀
[1:45:31] PinnxelGRP: could Singed beat Udyr
[1:45:40] Clyde1500: RaccAttack Clap
[1:45:41] Shobes572: so many KC stans
[1:45:52] Sjkaev: RaccAttack
[1:45:56] SomeFerretGuy: what kc stans we just like watching bo
[1:45:57] UpYerArs: come on we have to see the Perkz int first guts
[1:46:00] UpYerArs: guys*
[1:46:01] DixMX: hmm sounds interesting
[1:46:02] Zebrios: @PinnxelGRP No, they'd both just run away from each other the whole game.
[1:46:02] bombpipeule: ok ok   1 more game and bed
[1:46:04] fatalqwerty: @PinnxelGRP they would just proxy each other until someone gets caught by the other's teammates
[1:46:11] uhliterofcola: are you still consulting in siege at ll?
[1:46:16] fIuffee: oh i got a gift sub
[1:46:18] kraethan: RaccAttack
[1:46:19] fIuffee: thx
[1:46:23] tylerfromtaylorstreet: @MonteCristo Why do you think it took so long for Udyr to gain popularity. Doesn't seem like any of the changes seemed to warrant this level of response?
[1:46:26] jam43099: i had a bet at KX's 5 game that they would win at least 2 games and i was right
[1:46:29] Shobes572: RaccAttack
[1:46:37] uhliterofcola: gotcha
[1:46:45] Sjkaev: man i just wanted to see KC transform into shanghai dragons
[1:46:50] garmvup: What's lecs best role rn?
[1:46:50] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:46:54] Zebrios: I think Sett is going to be another big pick.
[1:47:00] QuackTheDuck: @tylerfromtaylorstreet its the tank items, did you see how long Bin survived there?
[1:47:02] Zebrios: Sett with tank items is bonkers
[1:47:18] SomeFerretGuy: jungle?
[1:47:18] Shobes572: ornn is another good clearing tank
[1:47:20] QuackTheDuck: Top
[1:47:22] archie7497: Jungle no?
[1:47:25] thugitakhrushchev: uhhh LUL
[1:47:27] fernysilva19: @QuackTheDuck dom said if rumble takes cdr runes and uses e to stack heat he can fight back to not get pushed back from early cs
[1:47:28] cfctrexx: Jungle
[1:47:30] Giiino: is TSM basically dead? havent heard from them in a while
[1:47:31] Sjkaev: definitely not mid
[1:47:35] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  adcs are untankable. but you can tank mages with just 1 tank item, rookern is too OP
[1:47:38] DixMX: support with Targamas Zoelys
[1:47:39] bombpipeule: XDD
[1:47:45] fIuffee: that magic shield item that refreshes every 12s is absolutely crazy
[1:47:50] ItzShade10: yeah i think unironically top
[1:47:50] Mykah9: @Giiino TSM sold their spot i thinj
[1:47:51] tylerfromtaylorstreet: @QuackTheDuck Yes i agree items are good, but there were FAR higher prio tanks before the changes that also benefit from the item changes.
[1:47:54] SomeFerretGuy: sure as hell ain't mid anymore LuL
[1:47:58] aoersie: I think ADC
[1:48:06] Giiino: @Mykah9 looks like theyre laying off staff now too
[1:48:07] Karego: TSM ragequit
[1:48:12] kshyle: @aoersie western acs are kinda mid xdd
[1:48:12] Warzard908: my GOAT ODO
[1:48:22] QuackTheDuck: didnt TSM said they were going to LPL?
[1:48:22] fatalqwerty: is Bo finally free from suffering? FeelsBadMan
[1:48:23] Sjkaev: we have won the holy war
[1:48:23] Zebrios: The Holy War has been won.
[1:48:36] Sarm_: rest in piss
[1:48:36] aoersie: @kshyle better than Western tops/mids comparatively
[1:48:41] Warzard908: My poor bo
[1:48:45] tylerfromtaylorstreet: Not LPL specifically just a Tier 1 league.
[1:48:52] fatalqwerty: wait a minute... why are KC 1-7?? monkaHmm
[1:48:56] Zebrios: I HATE early Renata picks
[1:49:03] SomeFerretGuy: because they wona game and lost seven
[1:49:04] QuackTheDuck: isnt ashe a counter pick into the kalista tho?
[1:49:05] schmidtycontent: do you think that LCS being on the live patch will be beneficial for development of the league? or is it a gimmick for views?
[1:49:07] Mykah9: There is only one team left that started in LCS start and that is Team Liquid
[1:49:22] kerokerogrips: @schmidtycontent could be both
[1:49:26] Sjkaev: targa bard monkaS
[1:49:32] UpYerArs: Lowkey happy that Dunc cunt got fucked in the ass. He was so high up his ass just for deep throating TSM, just needed to be brought down to reality
[1:49:35] Deathheart30: pyke and blitz banned
[1:49:35] dbxnaato: i'm worried what'll happen to KC once teams start banning saken's azir
[1:49:37] kshyle: @aoersie wasn't the biggest gap last worlds the adc/top - tbf mid was a much lower impact role that patch
[1:49:48] DixMX: @schmidtycontent in theory might be beneficial, but in practice seems just a gimmick so far
[1:49:54] ItzShade10: really good draft by KC
[1:50:03] MoldyCalzone: Olaf is god here
[1:50:08] ItzShade10: happy for yamato tbh.. even tho i dont support them :)
[1:50:17] Sjkaev: olaf very underrated right now
[1:50:25] zen__cloud: @dbxnaato they go 0-7 OMEGALUL
[1:50:39] tylerfromtaylorstreet: @schmidtycontent have you watched LCS lol. Problem with playing on live patch is you dont get the prep time to find bugs. Pauses almost every game so far.
[1:50:48] dbxnaato: @zen__cloud think of the future, not the past
[1:50:48] Sjkaev: olaf was basically free in that game
[1:50:52] Zebrios: Showmaker went Super Saiyan that game
[1:51:04] Sjkaev: 3 of the enemy champions couldnt do shit LUL
[1:51:06] DixMX: Bwipo stomped with Olaf too
[1:51:13] QuackTheDuck: isnt BDS comp super hard to execute? basically you NEED to be so ahead or you lose?
[1:51:14] PinnxelGRP: who kills Olaf here though LUL he just has free reign over the backline, they cant kill him fast enough and he just avoids their cc
[1:51:15] makancheeze: does olaf ult stop him from getting bard ulted?
[1:51:39] airbrid: He beats Renekton in Lane as well
[1:51:44] ItzShade10: best game out of cabo this split
[1:51:47] ItzShade10: shame it didnt count
[1:51:53] Len_xyz: @montecristo if you are a coach, who would you choose between someone who plays 2-3 champs incredibly consistently and someone who has a big champ pool but might not be consistent in all of them?

[1:52:18] PinnxelGRP: I wonder if Yamato still gets sacked after the split even after giving them great drafts for the most part
[1:52:20] archie7497: @montecristo Cabo is a Olaf player ever since the rework. He played it in lfl
[1:52:34] Zebrios: Looking forward to rewatching that G2 vs SK game.  Hyli doesn't disappoint on being Hyli
[1:52:35] kshyle: @ItzShade10 wasn't his rumble better last game - he kinda got rolled early in lane this game good teamfights though
[1:52:59] zen__cloud: @dbxnaato i mean saken looked bad on some of the previous azir games they lost anyway
[1:53:09] kookoolau: picking renekton is really wrong
[1:53:21] ItzShade10: @ItzShade10 felt like he did more this game with olaf than rumble.. later on he didnt really play the fights too well IMO
[1:53:22] fatalqwerty: bets on whether a scripted pause for the Kitkat plug happens in this game? Kappa
[1:53:24] QuackTheDuck: @kookoolau what would you blind then?
[1:53:25] archie7497: It's so trash. Crisp started this HoB Renata bullshit
[1:53:29] fIuffee: There is a real argument to be made that yamatocannon is the most handsome coach to ever step into the league scene
[1:53:36] Zebrios: I think renekton needs a rework.  His kit is so power crept
[1:53:45] yuio3456: HoB is getting run on every range support now
[1:53:57] kookoolau: Adams should pick the Gods champions
[1:54:22] kookoolau: Adams can play at least 5 champs
[1:55:18] PinnxelGRP: Adam should try rumble, it feels like it would be his type of champion
[1:55:54] zen__cloud: why doesn't adam try to learn/prac new champs
[1:56:06] fIuffee: Is Adam the best toplaner in the west at the moment? It's either him or Dhokla in my opinion
[1:56:13] kookoolau: adams is not good in Rumble
[1:56:13] PinnxelGRP: its weird he cant, rumble is such a good all in champ like garen
[1:56:23] Zebrios: Bo with the walk by steal LUL
[1:56:27] dbxnaato: great steal
[1:56:50] AdmiralReggie: wp
[1:56:56] fatalqwerty: Adam baited cabo really well here, who said Cabo woke up for this game? LUL
[1:56:57] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:56:59] fatalqwerty: he;s getting bodied
[1:57:11] kookoolau: to be honest, Adams is really the best in west, he can also 1 vs 1 Against LPL team
[1:57:27] kookoolau: and lck team ban his Darius too
[1:57:45] Zebrios: I guarantee you non of the top 3 LCK teams would ban his darius
[1:57:47] fIuffee: definitely. adam is probably top 3 toplaners in the world atm
[1:57:56] fIuffee: handsome too
[1:58:00] kookoolau: not the top 3 LUL
[1:58:04] PinnxelGRP: adam is a toplaner in the world right now for sure
[1:58:15] SpaceTurtl3: such an odd champ not to play, it’s not like it’s riven or some random super mechanical champ. not trying to underplay rumble micro but it’s not the same as some other tops
[1:58:19] fIuffee: I am adam's agent
[1:58:25] fatalqwerty: flufee, are you adam's fluffer?
[1:58:29] yalestream: made olaf unable to back off
[1:59:12] AzureCatalyst: @zebrios just a thought though. the top LCK teams might just ban Adam’s champs because he’s a detriment to his team when he’s not on his gods champs and can be a focal for Korean tops to punish
[1:59:40] PinnxelGRP: didn't Canna bully adam at Worlds
[1:59:56] WarpstoneHoarder: Saken has to be one of the worst Azirs
[2:00:10] AdmiralReggie: get dooted EZ
[2:00:14] Zebrios: @AzureCatalyst They'd love for someone to pay Darius against them.  No matter how good he is at the champ, someone mechanical like Zeus would crush anyone playing Darius
[2:00:15] thugitakhrushchev: @WarpstoneHoarder supposedly his best champs too
[2:00:16] War_Wren: its his best champ tho
[2:00:19] Sjkaev: targa actually does something this game
[2:00:21] QuackTheDuck: @Zebrios I mean thats just not true, DK banned his Darius first 3, against BDS
[2:00:26] fatalqwerty: he wanted Targ to get the perfect Q with that one
[2:00:28] mjoll_the_hotness: kc unleashed like na teams back in the days at words when there isnt pressure on them
[2:00:35] SpaceTurtl3: the west is doomed
[2:00:39] ItzShade10: yes
[2:00:42] ItzShade10: it was grief
[2:00:44] SpaceTurtl3: that team is 7-1
[2:00:44] Evan_Ralston: targamas actually has a pretty good game
[2:00:46] zionsick: Hello good sir Monte.
[2:00:48] socks1617: gotta get hail of blades value ICANT
[2:00:55] kookoolau: BDS problem is sup, ad, jungle
[2:01:06] dynamomarsh: Labrov helping KC think they shouldn't replace anyone so that they keep this roster for spring. Big brained tbh
[2:01:06] kookoolau: BDS mid is still ok
[2:01:08] AzureCatalyst: @zebrios Zeus Jayce vs Adam Darius would be a feast but I think the Macro diff that T1 would have with TP and bot dives would be the bigger gap than any mechanical punish
[2:01:37] zionsick: Was there a poll today as well that I missed?
[2:01:44] AzureCatalyst: yep
[2:01:46] MissingMatter: I'm confused. KC's playing and they haven't cut to Taylor Swift in the audience yet.
[2:01:52] kookoolau: Labrov problem is mispositioning
[2:01:54] zionsick: FML
[2:01:55] AzureCatalyst: the KC RaccAttack won
[2:01:57] SqueektheWeek: how do you feel about watching films at 1.5 or so? do you think it reduces artistic integrity? @MonteCristo

[2:02:02] socks1617: @MissingMatter lol
[2:02:03] infinite_zed: Hey Monte hows it going
[2:02:16] Zebrios: @AzureCatalyst Have you seen Zeus' recent Yone games?  He would solo kill him at 3 minutes.
[2:02:20] PinnxelGRP: @MissingMatter thats because they have to cut to random people jumping in the audience instead
[2:02:27] QuackTheDuck: the result of this game doesnt actually matter right? KC is out of playoffs and BDS is already top 2?
[2:02:32] bombpipeule: didnt realise KC was that bad
[2:02:35] bombpipeule: monkaW
[2:02:46] kookoolau: Zeus is just too good LUL can 1 vs 4
[2:02:54] mjoll_the_hotness: yeah kc is been out already so this is how they are supposed to look in theory for start of the split
[2:03:02] SpaceTurtl3: KC are like the chiefs, but if they lost every game
[2:03:10] Zebrios: KC was probably the biggest disappointment LEC has ever had for a team.
[2:03:12] kookoolau: renekton pick was the problem
[2:03:14] ItzShade10: they wanted to secure first place so i imagine they were not holding back
[2:03:17] AzureCatalyst: @zebrios I wouldn’t disagree but just having to in the mid game would fucking ruin BDS for midgame skirmishes that Zeus would either flank or splitpush
[2:03:18] Karego: ??
[2:03:24] Halalpillango: i think it definitely matters for the KC players mentally
[2:03:48] coin1: cause hes bad
[2:03:50] PinnxelGRP: just place it more back so that ice has to flash or walk forward
[2:03:50] infinite_zed: I feel like the old format would be so much better for the KC team FeelsBadMan
[2:04:00] yalestream: did he think he would go for the low minion
[2:04:03] zionsick: Skillshot 101
[2:04:18] QuackTheDuck: I think even if ice is hit labrov and sheo was nearby so he wasnt that scared thats why he didnt flash
[2:04:20] mjoll_the_hotness: like you have yamato coach and bo is semi rookie i guess. weird to see them be nervous when the pressure was on
[2:04:24] Turole: @coin1 I think you might be on to something LUL
[2:04:36] Zebrios: Labrov with the worst renata ult in history
[2:04:42] kerokerogrips: so glad these wins made everyone see Bo is definitely not the problem within the team
[2:04:58] infinite_zed: Bo is so insane of a player
[2:04:58] ItzShade10: respect the try
[2:04:59] Sjkaev: just 1 sec too late
[2:05:14] ItzShade10: they were already out yeah
[2:05:19] killerpineapple1: if he bought boots instead of that extra cloth he prob gets the catch right
[2:05:19] MissingMatter: Labrov just hooking Targamas up with an even useless-ult trade.
[2:05:23] Irollex: @infinite_zed I don’t think so. sure they are out at last place, but now they have no excuses to make changes. we have seen these players some of them just aren’t lec level
[2:05:30] Zebrios: Bo should have stayed in KR.  He would've gotten on a good team.
[2:05:34] Sjkaev: lmao
[2:05:42] PinnxelGRP: Upset could kill Vi there come on
[2:05:43] zionsick: that interaction lol
[2:05:44] ItzShade10: funny interaction KEKW
[2:05:50] Halalpillango: especially in the last two games bo is just running in fighting whoever is in front of him LuL love to see it
[2:05:50] QuackTheDuck: that was a fun interaction lmao
[2:05:53] kshyle: they also have kalista r lol
[2:05:54] MissingMatter: Bard is so fun.
[2:05:58] Sjkaev: a reverse ksante ult LUL
[2:06:02] Rhimeth: @Zebrios was in CN and banned
[2:06:08] yalestream: a very bard play
[2:06:18] chandler55: damn
[2:06:26] PinnxelGRP: Sheo used flash right why does it show that he has it
[2:06:38] kshyle: @PinnxelGRP lec production LuL
[2:06:46] yalestream: i like those "rule breaker" champs like bard
[2:06:50] PinnxelGRP: flash timer guy got fired FeelsBadMan
[2:06:54] GelatoSquid: Grubby's been playing league lately and he's a bard main
[2:07:01] dbxnaato: bo's just getting all these steals
[2:07:01] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:07:03] zionsick: I feel that Bards ult is so tricky. is a huge hit or a huge miss
[2:07:10] SpaceTurtl3: sheo 59 cs lol
[2:07:10] Zebrios: @Rhimeth I meant CN.  And wasn't aware he was banned.
[2:07:10] QuackTheDuck: what rule is he breaking? @yalestream
[2:07:10] Sjkaev: OH NOOOOO
[2:07:13] azaley_dayinghe: He’s just bought his spot back for the next split
[2:07:13] kshyle: LuL
[2:07:13] ItzShade10: NAHHH
[2:07:16] Melkerull: @zionsick like that LuL
[2:07:17] zionsick: Like that
[2:07:25] mjoll_the_hotness: targamas found his regular hand
[2:07:29] Halalpillango: love bard, targamas not so much KEKHeim
[2:07:30] mjoll_the_hotness: hands*
[2:07:31] yalestream: @QuackTheDuck allows immobile champs to travel through wallsd
[2:07:35] Len_xyz: @montecristo doms theory is that for bard mains, the worse you are at league overall, the better you are at bard.
[2:07:50] Sjkaev: the r's are just sloppy
[2:07:51] MissingMatter: @QuackTheDuck "Walls exist." "Towers shoot people."
[2:07:58] fatalqwerty: Targamas is just honest he doesnt want your expectations to rise so much
[2:07:58] Esterifikace: he is just showing off that he actually can save people
[2:08:01] yalestream: thats the singed theory i think
[2:08:06] zionsick: @Len_xyz lmao
[2:08:10] Zebrios: Bo is NOT afraid to use his ult on CD
[2:08:20] Rhimeth: @Zebrios was for match-fixing in ldl iirc
[2:08:23] Sjkaev: dom's theory is sick
[2:08:23] AzureCatalyst: Doms just applying the Singed theory to Bard
[2:08:26] Zebrios: @Rhimeth Oof
[2:08:26] brandofan2: i love how bo holds saken's hand and saken can still not play the game
[2:08:31] SpaceTurtl3: lord beryl has hands now, we won’t take any slander
[2:08:40] HomemadeShiv: Whats your workout split?
[2:08:42] Hide_in_Jungle: I just stretched too from gym sore, haha
[2:08:42] fatalqwerty: @brandofan2 that goes for all KC lanes if we're being honest
[2:08:45] Vailyon: keep stretching it out NODDERS
[2:08:58] Shobes572: cheer200 flex for us?
[2:08:58] SqueektheWeek: please get trymbi in the of season
[2:08:59] PinnxelGRP: classic upset
[2:09:01] SpaceTurtl3: mind game
[2:09:02] zionsick: How do you have time for hitting the gym Monte
[2:09:03] Sjkaev: whats the point of kalista then LUL
[2:09:09] Halalpillango: ye to be fair Targamas was fine this game
[2:09:12] Len_xyz: oh wait for the rift incident LUL
[2:09:12] brandofan2: @brandofan2 true its just mostly this game where his azir is giga ahead but refuses to shuffle anyone
[2:09:16] ItzShade10: upset was bot greeding for plate LUL
[2:09:20] QuackTheDuck: I mean Kalista needs to get the wave so Shrug
[2:09:22] MissingMatter: We had a postgame interview with drake and it said it didn't really enjoy being hit with spears.
[2:09:25] yalestream: maybe its a case of "surely they wont do dragon without kalista"
[2:09:25] fatalqwerty: Do you do cardio or do you just lift @MonteCristo
[2:09:28] jayhow24: no pain no gain
[2:09:29] HomemadeShiv: Like your weekly routine for workout? I do Push Pull Legs
[2:09:39] PinnxelGRP: Can't blame Kalista she needed to fix the wave there
[2:09:40] mjoll_the_hotness: hes been lifting his kids for massive biceps also
[2:09:42] Zachary_Blobman: if upset helps they get it easy
[2:09:49] Sjkaev: monte is a man of discipline
[2:09:51] Vailyon: Monte is time lord, Got it.
[2:10:00] zionsick: Oh that's great that you have the gym so close
[2:10:09] QuackTheDuck: why didnt BDS finish the grubs?
[2:10:15] saltywalty1337: swol Monte incoming
[2:10:19] Hide_in_Jungle: Muay Thai Mon Tee
[2:10:20] fIuffee: do you think you could beat marc merrill in a fight
[2:10:21] fatalqwerty: are you still sponsored by that pre-workout?
[2:10:30] MissingMatter: Dumbbells don't squirm.
[2:10:31] Sjkaev: good workout
[2:10:31] Shobes572: I do calisthenics at home so I don’t ever have an excuse to not work out
[2:10:32] azaley_dayinghe: Imagine they keep their streak next split and win the LEC.
[2:10:36] zionsick: Yeah, dad strength is real
[2:10:36] dbxnaato: monte building that dad bod
[2:10:43] fIuffee: tossing children builds a lot of strength
[2:10:46] Vailyon: moving weights NODDERS
[2:10:46] Shobes572: but my office complex has gym facilities
[2:10:47] Halalpillango: i think they would have more success if the team just follows up Bo's aggresiveness more
[2:10:56] domthehobo: i can squat like 350 but i get gassed playing with my nephews
[2:10:56] AzureCatalyst: your core is going to be fantastic with all the bending over and picking them up
[2:11:02] azevedao: Don't you just drop them on the floor after you're done?
[2:11:05] Melkerull: sheeeeesh
[2:11:05] thugitakhrushchev: @azaley_dayinghe nah I dont see that happening. Their solo lanes + support are mad suspect.
[2:11:05] jayhow24: dead weight from a child is no joke
[2:11:12] airbrid: True kettlebells help the core A LOT
[2:11:13] yalestream: maybe he will weaponize his wallet
[2:11:15] saltywalty1337: sjokz fired
[2:11:18] Zebrios: We need to find someone for Montecristo to celebrity box with
[2:11:18] Shobes572: clip it and ship it
[2:11:20] gorwings: Did I miss the g2-sk game?
[2:11:21] mjoll_the_hotness: single leg kick will do it
[2:11:22] fatalqwerty: That's why I always laughed when people wanted to pit Regi versus Monte. Regi was a fat fuck while monte was lean
[2:11:30] Zachary_Blobman: do u still have feeling in your shins?

[2:12:29] SirHoundSound: Have you prewatched these games are is this the first time watching them?
[2:12:36] BORED2212: hi monte, any theories on why LPL is slower than LCK this year?
[2:12:39] Shobes572: I have prepped mortadella and halloumi pita pockets for lunch
[2:12:43] Halalpillango: Cabo was really good in the previous game too
[2:12:44] zionsick: @Shobes572 Monte ate one yesterday and its been brewing on my mind making one
[2:12:49] QuackTheDuck: I remember when you can just stopwatch an olaf ult
[2:12:58] fIuffee: do you know if any match fixing goes on in LEC or LCS?
[2:13:13] azaley_dayinghe: G2 game was so good, LCK level they played.
[2:13:14] PapaSmithy: bitrate snob WutFace
[2:13:27] BigMightyena: Papa Pog
[2:13:27] brandofan2: do we hope they do full english broadcast by the start of summer?
[2:13:27] MissingMatter: I think the match fixing guys got fired.
[2:13:28] SirHoundSound: oh dang, papa in the house
[2:13:29] DrakeAcula: i think the LEC can go to 1440p right?
[2:13:29] thugitakhrushchev: PogChamp Pap
[2:13:31] Vailyon: What is who ya
[2:13:31] QuackTheDuck: Papa Pog
[2:13:34] PinnxelGRP: Youre going to see Perkz matchfixing soon trust me
[2:13:40] Shobes572: there’s too much visibility now unlike leagues earlier days
[2:13:53] maletroll: Pros from major leagues make a decent salary, no need to matchfix like lower league players
[2:13:55] Melkerull: @PinnxelGRP lmao his first incident was sus
[2:13:55] cfctrexx: Chinese streams are actually so advanced compared to twitch
[2:14:01] zionsick: Is Ashe that good as ADC vs having her as support?
[2:14:08] Halalpillango: Dom was costreaming on bilibili, its so much better than anything in the west its crazy
[2:14:21] QuackTheDuck: from showmaker?
[2:14:35] yalestream: hydra is weird anyways since he can just use 2 Qs to kill a wave
[2:14:40] domthehobo: @cfctrexx if by advanced you mean tons of ads and weird emoji filled messages floating on top of the screen
[2:14:44] Goatsguffle: does the coaching staff tell them what they should build in situations or  is that strictly up to the player?
[2:14:44] Sjkaev: cabo lived LUL
[2:14:47] PinnxelGRP: poor Bo
[2:14:48] Violet_Katt: vid looks like its 720p
[2:15:03] QuackTheDuck: nuc shouldnt have ult, nuc should just hit the olaf no?
[2:15:08] 0RE0N: why didn't he blastcone to dragon pit?
[2:15:12] dbxnaato: bo with the life save
[2:15:13] Esterifikace: bo is just too good
[2:15:19] yalestream: he also took out the vi for that fight thou
[2:15:31] Violet_Katt: oh wow i guess the broadcast itself is just wack then, unfortunate
[2:15:31] fIuffee: no offense but the video looks like its 1080p
[2:15:32] doraymeyoh: doraymeyoh subscribed with Prime. 
[2:15:38] Esterifikace: Saken triggered me so hard here
[2:15:55] fatalqwerty: rate that Renata ult out of 10 Kappa
[2:16:01] fIuffee: saken 0 mana the whole fight
[2:16:03] Sjkaev: HAHAHA
[2:16:06] zionsick: wth
[2:16:08] 0RE0N: rewatch entire fight watching only saken please :)
[2:16:12] AzureCatalyst: Watch Saken's Mana management during this fight
[2:16:13] zionsick: that's tilting
[2:16:27] yuio3456: gets the healing from E finish?
[2:16:27] Sjkaev: that has to be tilting
[2:16:28] AzureCatalyst: Saken uses like 400 mana worth of spells and autos 3 times without soldiers
[2:16:31] Esterifikace: saken does literally nothing the entire fight
[2:16:34] Sjkaev: thats twice now in 1 minute
[2:16:36] profound23: This reminds me of every Azir in solo que
[2:16:42] dbxnaato: saken has presence of mind, if only he got a kill
[2:16:42] kraethan: I think comet hits but he gets a bard heal
[2:16:44] AzureCatalyst: Watch his mana management monte it's disgusting
[2:16:51] Evan_Ralston: How did Saken not find a time to ult during all of that?
[2:16:52] Violet_Katt: his best champ btw KEK
[2:16:53] yalestream: w/o the mao they have like no lockdown
[2:16:54] fatalqwerty: You've been spoiled by Korean Azirs
[2:16:58] kalidios: Needed 1 assist to get mana
[2:17:00] nyahken: he tried to dodge the renata ult but didn't and wasted mana
[2:17:00] zionsick: Does he cancel AA?
[2:17:02] azaley_dayinghe: Saken so scared
[2:17:04] PinnxelGRP: mage items give no mana now so its hard to manage
[2:17:06] BORED2212: any concerns that KC don’t make roster changes based on these wins even though they came under no pressure?
[2:17:07] ItzShade10: yeah its subpar.. to say the least
[2:17:10] fIuffee: saken's azir is extremely clean imo
[2:17:10] Halalpillango: his best champ Keepo
[2:17:10] Sjkaev: pls saken you gotta have some other pick besieds azir
[2:17:16] fatalqwerty: LOOK AT THAT LUL
[2:17:16] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:17:18] AzureCatalyst: LOL
[2:17:19] AzureCatalyst: HAHAH
[2:17:20] TLS_Fish1: Don't listen to Dom about Saken being good on Azir.
[2:17:29] Shobes572: sand soldiers only for farming
[2:17:29] 0RE0N: that's why he didn't have mana, he wasted it all
[2:17:32] dianstyle: was Dom saying Azir is his best champ?
[2:17:48] arthradot: oh goodness
[2:17:55] fatalqwerty: His sand soldiers only attacked once that whole fight, might as well have just picked corki and spammed missiles
[2:17:55] Shobes572: @dianstyle it is but that doesn’t change he’s still shit at it
[2:17:55] PinnxelGRP: Dom said Azir was his best champ because it was his most played
[2:18:01] Sjkaev: no fucking way
[2:18:04] azaley_dayinghe: Aurelion is his best champ
[2:18:06] zionsick: lol
[2:18:13] AzureCatalyst: Saken is a trashcan and it's actually impressive that Targamas is somehow worse than him
[2:18:26] Sjkaev: how is a midlaner this bad...
[2:18:27] profound23: Nothing wrong with accepting who you are and locking in the Malzahar ^^
[2:18:28] Halalpillango: to be fair i think neeko is his best champ, he looked the best on her
[2:18:28] Zoht_: watch kc make n changes cause they won 2 games at the end
[2:18:32] dbxnaato: bo looks so good this game
[2:18:39] AzureCatalyst: YEEEEE
[2:18:40] Shobes572: @azurecatalyst 🤣
[2:18:44] yyang572: dom literally flame saken in this fight as well saying if he had hand he could of easily clean this fight up
[2:18:44] PinnxelGRP: and Bo
[2:18:45] fIuffee: drakos top 2 most annoying casters
[2:18:46] MoldyCalzone: LUL
[2:18:47] zionsick: lmao
[2:18:47] thugitakhrushchev: THE FACT THAT KC MIGHT ACTUALLY RAN BACK THIS TEAM IS CRIMINAL
[2:18:55] azaley_dayinghe: He’s not dying, very good for his standard
[2:18:57] Sjkaev: i dont even wanna know what this team does without Yamato..
[2:18:58] 0RE0N: Bo picked Maokai because Sheo was taunting him on twitter for entire split
[2:18:58] Shobes572: where’s thr Yamato cam!
[2:19:02] Goatsguffle: does the coaching staff tell them what they should build in situations or is that strictly up to the player?
[2:19:04] saltywalty1337: Caedrel was saying they only started playing better because they have nothing to lose now
[2:19:06] AzureCatalyst: @Shobes572 Legit I've watch saken fucking inting games with more subtlety than his LEC games
[2:19:08] SqueektheWeek: @MonteCristo Dom mentioned that his best win rate Azir had a 55% win rate... that is not good
[2:19:12] QuackTheDuck: I mean Bo is also playing extremely aggressive
[2:19:13] Warzard908: Bro i wish someone banned azir in any of the games so we could see anything else with saken
[2:19:13] gorwings: Yamato has put up some great drafts
[2:19:21] BORED2212: LEC casters are always too lenient and justifying bad plays , meanwhile LPL zooms in on bad plays
[2:19:30] fIuffee: honestly the draft is likely all saken's doing
[2:19:31] dynamomarsh: I am excited for this team to be back in spring for the 0-7 start. 2 wins on the bounce when no expectations are set, for them to run it back in summer once more.
[2:19:31] AzureCatalyst: @SqueektheWeek KC was like a 60-70% winrate team in ERLs though right?
[2:19:33] fIuffee: guy is a machine
[2:19:42] Shobes572: @azurecatalyst yeah I’ve seen them as well lol
[2:19:53] SqueektheWeek: @AzureCatalyst welcome to LEC
[2:19:58] saltywalty1337: now that they win two they'll run in back with the same group...and the result will be similar imo
[2:20:05] azaley_dayinghe: That’s not Ibai opinion
[2:20:12] fIuffee: feel so bad for yamato with this team man
[2:20:17] PinnxelGRP: wow ice needed to flash that bard stun
[2:20:23] Halalpillango: adam helping out targamas KEKHeim
[2:20:24] Voltiate: Olaf having the time of his life back there
[2:20:25] Zachary_Blobman: targamas smurfed that fight
[2:20:32] AzureCatalyst: @SqueektheWeek No I'm saying that if his team averages a 60-70% winrate him managing to somehow get a 55% winrate on his best champ is actually disgusting
[2:20:44] dynamomarsh: its player skill when they don't flash a bard ult tbf.
[2:20:45] dbxnaato: i mean bo looks really good, i'd call him MVP
[2:20:47] Shobes572: cheer100 so the lesson is, Yamato needs to out draft his own team running it down
[2:20:53] Zoogs: @montecristo why is dom so stuck on lpl and not Lck?
[2:20:54] SqueektheWeek: @AzureCatalyst but hes french!
[2:20:59] AzureCatalyst: Like actually how is your best champ worse winrate than your team's average winrate
[2:21:01] Zoht_: ofc monte these are insane players they should keep them all for next split
[2:21:08] Sjkaev: olaf here is just having a field day
[2:21:13] Melkerull: targa has a crazy ult later as well
[2:21:14] yalestream: havent seen a single ashe arrow to fish for a engage either
[2:21:18] zionsick: Olaf doesn't give a shit
[2:21:18] flopagis: that's bard for you
[2:21:19] colonelsoap: so what ur telling me if that KC is the best drafting team of all time
[2:21:24] arthradot: yamato using his costreamer skills to great effect
[2:21:27] Zachary_Blobman: only bad targamas play was golden tower
[2:21:42] dianstyle: Ok guys just look at the last 2 games KC is the second best team in LEC
[2:21:42] Zoht_: targamas gonna trick them all to keep him for next split NotLikeThis
[2:21:44] AzureCatalyst: HOLY
[2:21:45] Sjkaev: still not sold on the bard tho
[2:21:52] flopagis: bard is hard to play and not look goofy at least once a game
[2:21:55] AzureCatalyst: Saken wastes his E and Q to dash in instead of jsut takign the magical journey WHY THE FUCK
[2:21:56] oMrGo: could it also be some Steak info making the drafts so good? Or is he running into a wall trying to teach the chickens macro?
[2:22:04] Zebrios: Dom found a niche
[2:22:09] yalestream: this woulda been much better with ori instead of azir
[2:22:11] AzureCatalyst: Legit he runs parallel to the magical journey instead of just taking the fucking portal
[2:22:12] dbxnaato: LPL's cool as heck
[2:22:15] fIuffee: Honestly, Bo, Dhokla, Bjergsen, Upset, and Zeyzal would be such a banger team
[2:22:16] yyang572: also he does not have costream right to lck

[2:22:19] SqueektheWeek: LPL is the MSI region for a hot minute
[2:22:19] mjoll_the_hotness: its his brand now
[2:22:22] Sjkaev: lpl is just more fun to watch, esp back in the day
[2:22:22] 0RE0N: Do you think KC will run it back with the same roster for Spring and should they?
[2:22:25] AzureCatalyst: LPL is his brand now I think
[2:22:28] Halalpillango: also Dom doesnt get rights for lck
[2:22:35] azaley_dayinghe: Adam, Nuc ex KC, Nisqy best friend of Kameto…. their wins not suspect all.
[2:22:35] dbxnaato: ehhh, bjerg's a baby
[2:22:38] kerokerogrips: dom gets like 100k views on his translate billi blli vids right ?
[2:22:39] Violet_Katt: well LS just isnt streaming anymore so there is a gap there to fill
[2:22:40] AzureCatalyst: He could costream LCK but I think LPL is definitely synonymous with Dom in western spheres
[2:22:43] UpYerArs: They might be brain damaged enough to use Olaf R and Bard R together making it useless
[2:22:47] Zoht_: cant kc just get trimby get the man a job
[2:22:53] fIuffee: really hope doms scores chinese citizenship soon
[2:22:56] Sdchen: bo quietly having a very good game despite how the kda looks
[2:22:57] TheMommik: LPL top teams are also really efficient with time and pressure
[2:22:57] lazink: And he is good at it
[2:22:57] AzureCatalyst: Flash renata ulti lol
[2:22:57] Halalpillango: @Violet_Katt he is streaming tho
[2:22:59] kerokerogrips: its a smart business decision until the ccp invades taiwan
[2:23:01] BORED2212: @montecristo hes also tried to get lck costream but someone at riot doesn’t want him to have it
[2:23:02] AzureCatalyst: That fucking renata ulti is disgusting
[2:23:05] commando1814: is ls still doing lol stuff
[2:23:20] Turole: I've started watching Saken in the fights since you called him out and it's straight up embarrassing
[2:23:30] AzureCatalyst: LS is having Visa issues so I think he was doing CBLOL and LCS costreams still
[2:23:33] PinnxelGRP: ok
[2:23:37] AzureCatalyst: I don't know if he is doing LCK stuff AFAIK at the moment
[2:23:37] Zachary_Blobman: nuc pretty smart with neeko clone
[2:23:38] PinnxelGRP: is labrov not throwing
[2:23:39] QuackTheDuck: Olaf has TP tho?
[2:23:41] Haziri_: It was also if memory serves around the time of the durability buffs and most regions were playing hyper conservative. LPL was exception and still doing early dives and aggression
[2:23:42] Zoogs: @montecristo yeah but lpl keeps@getting owned by LCK I love it!
[2:23:43] fIuffee: If LS has been coaching KC, they likely finish top 2. Top 4 at worst.
[2:23:44] yalestream: why didnt he time it with the bard ult
[2:23:45] PinnxelGRP: by ulting faster
[2:23:46] commando1814: @themommik what toplane champs do they use
[2:23:56] Zachary_Blobman: Nuc makes it look like a cannon wave.
[2:24:00] zionsick: terrible
[2:24:02] Shobes572: targamas just negating sekens ult lol
[2:24:04] dbxnaato: labrov MVP LUL
[2:24:04] Vexzelofc: it might not be up? the overlay is always off timers these days tbh
[2:24:06] yalestream: bard gave perfect setup for the renata ult
[2:24:07] hotblew1337: @fIuffee yamato is not the reason that mid top sup do not perform
[2:24:20] azaley_dayinghe: LS would put Saken on Soraka mid
[2:24:22] kraethan: Yeah wtf just press r
[2:24:26] hazeturderandere: lec is a joke lmao
[2:24:27] PinnxelGRP: or just ult immediately after bard ult
[2:24:28] yalestream: what
[2:24:31] fIuffee: hotblew1337 yamato is a fantastic coach. LS is simply transcendent.
[2:24:32] Krethas: that would have been a team wipe with an ult
[2:24:34] yalestream: thats a free 4 man renata ult
[2:24:37] Sjkaev: it wasnt on cd was it?
[2:24:38] yalestream: for like 5 sec
[2:24:40] 0RE0N: LS reviewed KC and absolutely hated Cabo and Saken
[2:24:41] Sdchen: also the angle is terrible when he finally throws it
[2:24:52] sota_cat: tagamas smurfing is trigerring me，
[2:25:00] colonelsoap: the ult was up the whole fight
[2:25:04] oMrGo: I wonder how big of a headache this team is giving Steak
[2:25:26] hotblew1337: @fIuffee i appreciate the sentiment but i really do think that saken and cabo and targ have been bots after like 15 min in the first 7 games
[2:25:33] 0RE0N: @oMrGo Steak is not in Berlin i think
[2:25:36] PinnxelGRP: no shot BDS are the best LEC team they look so bad, G2 wins LEC again for sure
[2:25:48] kerokerogrips: @0RE0N did he talk about targamas
[2:26:01] hotblew1337: @fIuffee hard to win when getting brain and hands gapped
[2:26:05] 0RE0N: @kerokerogrips he said hate on targamas is exaggerated and not talking is ok
[2:26:08] fIuffee: hotblew1337 im just joking man. everyone but bo and sort of upset is warm dogshit 😔
[2:26:10] oMrGo: @0RE0N oohhh, still? Is it a fully remote deal?
[2:26:15] Sjkaev: idiot proof comp truly
[2:26:20] QuackTheDuck: ok that was an insane ult
[2:26:26] naocorrijo: targamas and cabo solo carried this game, who would have thought
[2:26:40] azaley_dayinghe: Targamas MVP
[2:26:41] 0RE0N: @oMrGo i heard he is coming in feb. so should be there for spring split
[2:26:42] Its_Just_Andy: sheo qing into the bard ult, unlucky
[2:26:45] QuackTheDuck: did Sheo run into the ult?
[2:26:59] sota_cat: @naocorrijo that triger me even harder
[2:27:11] fIuffee: crazy good draft
[2:27:23] hotblew1337: @fIuffee mb idk u so had to take at face value even tho it seems troll af

[2:27:26] thugitakhrushchev: GIGACHAD Yamato drafting
[2:27:28] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips cap , im going with caedrel and dom on targamas' performance in the team
[2:27:37] fIuffee: hotblew1337 i understand 😌 ✊
[2:27:37] Halalpillango: KC running it down, out of playoffs, then beating two of the top3 teams, the classic KEKHeim
[2:27:37] Sjkaev: not even just bard ult, even just bard q is dangerous with mao combo
[2:27:38] 0RE0N: LS in general said a lot of even elite players barely talk just like Targamas and it's ok but he did criticize Targamas for mechanics and decision making
[2:27:40] Len_xyz: bo running aftershock Mao knowing he’s the one who has to tank is nice to see
[2:27:44] kraethan: Yeah like even shitters like me know to stand in a line for mao ult
[2:27:52] yalestream: the renata positioning and ults are so bad this game
[2:28:05] Violet_Katt: that was a cool af setup
[2:28:09] Zay7ay: KC top team?
[2:28:14] fatalqwerty: Monte is now a KC Believer RaccAttack Clap Monte is now a KC Believer RaccAttack Clap
[2:28:22] Sjkaev: mao ult makes aoe ccs primo
[2:28:28] QuackTheDuck: so why didnt KC draft like this week 1 and 2
[2:28:29] fatalqwerty: LUL
[2:28:30] fIuffee: KC is gonna do really well in playoffs. Excited to see them
[2:28:33] Warzard908: Then saken follow up
[2:28:38] younzable: Wouldn't that idea work in a maokai malphite combo to
[2:28:41] yalestream: vi going second item frozenheart with a team that has no dmg is kinda weird
[2:28:49] pedrolito_lol: bo is a good point this whole week at least
[2:28:51] sota_cat: yamato my boi
[2:28:58] l0st3560: I think they running it back tho
[2:28:59] 0RE0N: LS hated every single draft in first 2 weeks
[2:29:00] fatalqwerty: I cant believe people still shit on YamatoCanon calling him a fraud on reddit, just goes to show what they know
[2:29:01] boogieismyman: :)
[2:29:02] Sjkaev: they always had good-decent drafts
[2:29:04] dbxnaato: it's not almost idiot proof if KC can win, it -is- idiot proof LUL
[2:29:09] djdoovid: Bo was playing really good this week
[2:29:09] zen__cloud: LS hates yamato's drafts OMEGALUL
[2:29:15] Zoht_: They need to change mid/top/support for next split or is over
[2:29:15] Sdchen: who gets pog this game monte?
[2:29:22] Sdchen: yamato?
[2:29:23] Sjkaev: which is why it is baffling to see them lose this badly
[2:29:23] pedrolito_lol: saken is disgusting even in those games tho lmao
[2:29:26] fIuffee: please replace saken
[2:29:26] thugitakhrushchev: but Upset told me that they bad drafts Kappa
[2:29:29] QuackTheDuck: The Lilia when millio was up was a war crime tho
[2:29:33] l0st3560: facts
[2:29:33] oMrGo: Heard Dom thought all but 1 was a winning draft
[2:29:44] Halalpillango: to be fair most of their games they were ahead early, i think they could be better, tho i would pick up trymbi if possible.
[2:29:47] dynamomarsh: I can't wait to see another split of Forest losing money on KC bets.
[2:29:48] zen__cloud: trymbi peepoSad
[2:29:50] mjoll_the_hotness: unleash the trymbster
[2:29:50] 0RE0N: Finn >>> Cabo
[2:29:53] arthradot: in the long run these 2 wins could tank their potential lmao

[2:31:12] fIuffee: anyone else feel like upset is starting to go bald? 😔 doesn't make me feel good
[2:31:12] 0RE0N: why not, finn is good
[2:31:13] aoersie: @yyang572 yes he will be, Cabo isn't LEC level skill wise anymore
[2:31:23] awoogawooogawoo: kc should get theshy
[2:31:32] oMrGo: @fIuffee stress
[2:31:36] fIuffee: only dyrus can save kc
[2:31:51] yyang572: finn was abrely lec level as well. we seen this game so many time and everytime he just shit the bed

[2:32:39] yyang572: finn alway been good in soloq, he just a bad pro player
[2:32:46] aoersie: Like Finn won't lose you the game as Cabo did
[2:33:06] 0RE0N: He is not bad pro player, he has been misused by almost every team
[2:33:08] yyang572: you guy are just forgeting how atrocius finn was in lec and lcs
[2:33:23] Zoht_: finn was fine last time he was on lec better than ca bo for sure
[2:33:28] oMrGo: Looking at the comms, gotta change out Targa, Cabo's coms were actually good
[2:33:29] yyang572: the guy been giving more than a fair shot to prove himself
[2:33:31] 0RE0N: finn was literally 4th best toplaner on his debut year in 2019
[2:33:48] kerokerogrips: would trymbi even want to join kc if given an offer ?
[2:33:50] War_Wren: cabo is the third worst on KC, def not the main problem
[2:33:56] SqueektheWeek: we still have fnc and Th right?
[2:34:02] yyang572: @0RE0N and cabo was literally one of best eu toplaner in the past what your point
[2:34:04] oMrGo: @yyang572 Finn was good last summer on Ast
[2:34:08] aoersie: @yyang572 he was good last year
[2:34:17] 0RE0N: @kerokerogrips he has no other options if he wants to play in lec this year
[2:34:34] yyang572: @oMrGo and then he fell apart mid way through the season again
[2:35:01] yyang572: again you guy are just remembering the high of finn and ignoring his down games
[2:35:16] fIuffee: LEC needs to be 50% chinese in my opinion
[2:35:19] yyang572: finn was good for a period last year and then he shit the bed
[2:35:22] mjoll_the_hotness: finns is a rollercoaster of a player
[2:35:22] fIuffee: import a chinese top to KC
[2:35:28] 0RE0N: i mean finn is objectively top 10 toplaners in EU
[2:35:37] oMrGo: @yyang572 Felt more like a team (113) problem to me
[2:35:44] fIuffee: being the 10th best toplaner in a league is not a good thing
[2:35:48] yyang572: @0RE0N that not very hard when adam is one of the best toplaner in eu
[2:35:50] sota_cat: lets be real nip invicinble whos bo best friend in LDL   is free now，then trymbi for taga，thus team owns lec
[2:35:50] najafan: He's #1 in my heart.
[2:35:53] aoersie: Finn is like twice as good as Cabo right now, not even a debate
[2:35:54] Mykah9: @MonteCristo So real question what happened to Soaz?
[2:35:54] Zachary_Blobman: would you tell a player that if his performnce doesnt improve next split he's gonna be dropped/replaced? or it puts too much pressure
[2:36:08] najafan: Finn is the top laner most likely to quit and become a male model.
[2:36:12] naocorrijo: @Mykah9 positional coach for nrg
[2:36:26] fIuffee: finn might not be that good but he is insanely handsome. likely the most handsome pro player
[2:36:30] SqueektheWeek: @MonteCristo I discovered Gunship from your Renegades trailer, have you kept up with em?
[2:36:31] sota_cat: @fIuffee Nip invincible  bo best friend
[2:36:32] 0RE0N: @yyang572 KC will never go international this year anyway, Finn will be more than fine, he won't even be bottom 3 in LEC right now
[2:36:35] mjoll_the_hotness: rekkles gonna be a kpop star in korea i can feel it
[2:36:40] najafan: @fIuffee Well, Flame.
[2:36:45] Zoht_: u get finn trimby idk who u can get mid rn
[2:36:46] mjoll_the_hotness: after this support experiement
[2:36:50] fIuffee: imo finn beats him but flame is up there
[2:36:54] SqueektheWeek: @MonteCristo I discovered Gunship from your Renegades trailer, have you kept up with em??
[2:36:54] najafan: Let's be real here. Flame is gorgeous.
[2:37:01] aoersie: @zoht_ abbedagge

[2:37:27] SqueektheWeek: I think both albums after were pretty solid
[2:37:30] fatalqwerty: Flame and Watch, in another life, would've been in a kpop group
[2:37:32] mjoll_the_hotness: is relegades dude still casting or
[2:37:39] mjoll_the_hotness: what a moment in league history
[2:37:43] fIuffee: Would fielding a team of 5 very handsome players along with a handsome coach be a good business move? Even if they are bad
[2:37:48] azaley_dayinghe: Vlad was bad
[2:37:53] oMrGo: Maybe Nisqy gets French baited to KC
[2:38:08] pedrolito_lol: rakan is playable af here
[2:38:09] fatalqwerty: @fIuffee It's on the same level of getting 5 e-thots to be a pro league team
[2:38:34] fIuffee: that was amateur stuff though
[2:38:45] mjoll_the_hotness: ewww
[2:38:47] yyang572: @0RE0N ok sure but i dont think the going from carbo to finn is a bigger upgrade than replacing saken and targamas. that is my main argument
[2:38:49] Sjkaev: ad leblanc is shit
[2:38:53] mjoll_the_hotness: sounds wrong
[2:39:13] fatalqwerty: Who do we have replacing saken if ever? Is there any decent mid laner in the european market rn?
[2:39:23] fIuffee: just get a chinese mid
[2:39:32] mjoll_the_hotness: kc staff silly not throwing money at vetheo
[2:39:32] aoersie: @fatalqwerty abbedagge
[2:39:34] Esterifikace: how do you guys say ad leblanc is shit after watching Knight
[2:39:35] najafan: @fatalqwerty Yeah, except there's got to be at least 5 decently attractive challenger guys throughout every region combined.
[2:39:36] War_Wren: jizuke nemesis
[2:39:40] Tameimpala2: you replace him with poby GIGACHAD
[2:39:50] najafan: Is that true with women?
[2:39:50] 0RE0N: @yyang572 they should replace all 3 anyway or it will end up like XL last year who replace 2 for Spring and still end up 10th, they were too conservative with changes, left Xerxe and paid for it
[2:39:58] fIuffee: the goat
[2:39:59] Melkerull: chad
[2:40:01] yyang572: @fatalqwerty lider abba, i mean the sk midlaner was atleast able to play in lec
[2:40:02] Sjkaev: old man caps
[2:40:03] najafan: Team Siren had like, what, D4 players?
[2:40:09] mjoll_the_hotness: caps dad king of twitter
[2:40:11] fatalqwerty: I think KC cant replace Targamas because where the bodies are buried
[2:40:14] Sjkaev: Feelsgoodman
[2:40:15] fatalqwerty: he knows*
[2:40:21] 0RE0N: @fatalqwerty Lider or Jiizuke imo
[2:40:24] Mykah9: that can be you one day monte watching your kids blast at games on stage
[2:40:31] fIuffee: really unfair that caps is more bald than his dad
[2:40:36] naocorrijo: they'll probably replace saken with vladi, their academy mid
[2:40:41] Mykah9: And dressed sharply as you always do
[2:41:01] hotblew1337: jax fishing top lane for gold
[2:41:02] 0RE0N: the meta currently is extremely favorable for Lider
[2:41:17] hotblew1337: jax abusing fishing lore for 3 gold level 1 lead
[2:41:18] mjoll_the_hotness: old monte gonna be watching his kid in KT winnning worlds in the future FeelsStrongMan
[2:41:19] 0RE0N: Irelia will be playable soon, Akali is high prio
[2:41:21] pedrolito_lol: would u have liked rell here over xin ?
[2:41:22] fatalqwerty: are there any French free agents?
[2:41:33] fIuffee: let me know when lider can player corki/ori/azir
[2:41:36] Sjkaev: @Mykah9 monte just gonna dress up like a train conductor at every one of his kid's events LUL
[2:41:36] fIuffee: PLAY
[2:41:43] oMrGo: Gotta feel bad for the Ast laners
[2:41:57] aoersie: @0re0n meta can change until worlds, Abbe is way more versatile
[2:42:03] yyang572: @0RE0N i dont think kamicorp gonna replace all three that might just cause to big of a blow to his fanbase, cause now there is no player they can root for that came from erl
[2:42:08] 0RE0N: KC don't need French token players, their franchise player will be Caliste starting from next year
[2:42:37] mjoll_the_hotness: you want to ride the french hype for income

[2:43:08] fIuffee: that was well done
[2:43:13] 0RE0N: @mjoll_the_hotness even if KC sign 5 Spanish players, French will still watch, they are first and foremost Kameto fans
[2:43:30] QuackTheDuck: Why playing Leblanc with Lilia jungle? AP mid AP jungle?
[2:43:38] 0RE0N: @QuackTheDuck ad lb
[2:43:43] fatalqwerty: Almostp erfect if Hans Sama got the bailout
[2:43:55] greas3: Yike really is a level above EUW junglers (other than Jankos(
[2:44:09] fIuffee: just perfectly timing the autos i think
[2:44:24] yyang572: @0RE0N that is definely not true, these fan a little to diehard for nationally. That is literally the reason we been having all these drama between the spanish and france fans
[2:44:50] greas3: nothing drops aggro, mikyx dies. That's a normal interaction.
[2:45:01] fatalqwerty: Wow how didnt bailout proc there? That was very unfortunate
[2:45:07] StuntmanStan: Could be a bug Sneaky had some turret aggro bug today on his stream
[2:45:11] greas3: Lillia had no passive or red buff on rakan so it didn't aggro
[2:45:15] Lopseypop: @fatalqwerty He didnt "die"
[2:45:20] Melkerull: gg
[2:45:20] greas3: that's how it has always worked
[2:45:21] 0RE0N: @yyang572 they are Kameto vs Ibai fans, "spanish" fans don't cheer for Giants or Heretics, they are both influencer fanbases
[2:45:59] fatalqwerty: @StuntmanStan Sneaky still plays league? last I watched him I thought he was committed to being a femboy
[2:46:02] 0RE0N: like do you see KC fans cheering for Hans same?
[2:46:15] fatalqwerty: and was playing Valorant?
[2:46:43] StuntmanStan: @fatalqwerty he does both
[2:46:46] 0RE0N: they only cheer for KC, ex-Kc players, close friends like Nisqy or BDS because their headcoach was in KC. KC fans hate Vitality for example event tho they are french
[2:46:58] mjoll_the_hotness: sneaky had a nice career maybe its just time to do other things
[2:47:08] fatalqwerty: @StuntmanStan I wonder how he doesn't explode from pure toxicity if he plays both ranked league and valo

[2:50:29] Zebrios: Ksante is such a dumb champion
[2:51:04] ryandapple: how do you rate heimer support this season?
[2:51:46] mjoll_the_hotness: there was brand jungle in lpl kinda cool
[2:52:12] StuntmanStan: would xayah get gold for killing rakan

[2:54:43] oMrGo: Wasnt it big first in KR soloQ?
[2:54:53] fruge2: they buffed the shit out of all his jg clear damage like ya it was gonna find use
[2:55:07] TheFistification: It's weird how we decide who "invented" a strategy.
[2:55:16] Nevergiveupp9696: only bo and daglas played it in lec
[2:55:18] 0RE0N: Maokai support has 58% winrate, will he be flexed on 14.2 in pro?
[2:55:21] oMrGo: Why is Udyr not flexed to jungle?
[2:55:28] Vailyon: Riot invented it when they buffed his jungle clear :D
[2:55:32] Nevergiveupp9696: 1 time each
[2:55:34] fruge2: @TheFistification case by case basis ig
[2:55:38] colorblindgenius: @0RE0N he will be pick or ban
[2:55:39] brandofan2: xin zhao feels pretty weak imo
[2:56:12] TheFistification: Yeah. Did Riot invent double support item aswell? Or was that "figured out"?
[2:56:36] colorblindgenius: unintented and then abused kinda
[2:56:47] 0RE0N: @colorblindgenius I though he would be but LCS was on live patch and only 1 Mao support pick
[2:56:48] BeBeBamBam: I think that was T1 bot lane
[2:57:22] 0RE0N: oh wait it was LEC Targamas Mao
[2:57:29] colorblindgenius: @0RE0N LCS/LEC will first look at LCK/LPL and then it will be pick and ban LUL i mean he is overtuned with the 2% speed shard
[2:57:34] brandofan2: did you see Bo's double tower rift herald?
[2:57:44] fatalqwerty: Monte streaming at tiktok, all the lowlights gonna get the tiktok treatment with bg music on slow and reverb as some player does a dumb play LUL
[2:57:51] Zoht_: would be cool if youtube had a prime with premium
[2:58:32] Zebrios: SK was really disappointing this series

[2:59:39] Zebrios: @Zoht_ Yes.  Your complimentary bottle of ibuprofen and pre-packaged midlife crisis will arrive in the mail soon.
[2:59:41] fatalqwerty: Can you go to IG instead of tiktok? I'd rather give my data to mark zuckerberg than to Xi Jinping Kappa
[2:59:51] xMik9: i think your audience me included would have more chances of seeing facebook posts rather than tiktoks
[2:59:53] fIuffee: hey monte! I love seeing a new face in the LoL scene. Really hope you do well and I wish you the best of luck!
[3:00:01] Kaniskion: great brainwashing tool too
[3:00:06] oMrGo: Surely Udyr's base strength is strong enough to be a flex pick?

[3:02:14] 0RE0N: I still can't actually believe we haven seen any Bo Lee Sin or Graves after entire split. actually crazy
[3:02:16] Zebrios: Skip the pauses

[3:49:07] mephisto5faust: perkz the only midlaner that makes saken look good FeelsStrongMan
[3:49:41] cfctrexx: Can perkz play corki, it's the last meta champ left for him
[3:50:12] AzureCatalyst: I'm actually quite impressed with Jun and his integration with the team. I was skeptical of his addition at first

[3:50:20] Shobes572: @mephisto5faust forreal man. This makes sakens plays look clean
[3:50:24] dianstyle: Haven't been watching LEC,  Is perkz this bad the whole time or just this game
[3:50:25] S1lentSymphony: I mod for an Aussie streamer from Melbourne. I have *never* heard any of those sayings, Monte lol
[3:50:40] cfctrexx: Unironically Kaiser has been heretics best player this season
[3:50:49] alexandrv1992: perkz played good last week, no?
[3:51:01] deadpoool04: yeah week 1 week 2 was good for perkz
[3:51:06] Stuff1ng: Man you clearly don't hit the tavern
[3:51:07] BORED2212: @montecristo did you watch TES vs EDG? creme akali was very fun to watch
[3:51:08] deadpoool04: this week he was so baaaad
[3:51:08] S1lentSymphony: Hahaha
[3:51:19] ThatLatvianGuy: perkz has solo lost a game every week alexandrv1992
[3:51:23] Skixxxx: perkz is just inconsistent
[3:51:27] S1lentSymphony: Aussies are great, though. I watch a lot of them
[3:51:31] BannedFromChurch: yea naw
[3:51:31] Skixxxx: he has his moments
[3:51:40] S1lentSymphony: Naw yea @BannedFromChurch
[3:51:42] oMrGo: I wonder if Perkz would swap to support
[3:51:44] MissingMatter: They can't talk to strangers. Strangers might be venomous. In Australia, most things are, so you can't be too careful.
[3:51:49] brandofan2: i think Nymaera was saying that Noah was wanting an english speaking support so he could learn english better but im not sure how true that was
[3:52:03] mephisto5faust: he no longer has good moments and just ints 50% of the games away
[3:52:07] Shobes572: @bannedfromchurch sooooooo what's the story?

[3:53:04] Zebrios: I mean, even if he hit him, he still wouldn't have died.
[3:53:15] venomchameleon: plus he is not worth anything at the moment
[3:53:25] PlzN0: @Zebrios yeah udyr was only in range
[3:53:43] oMrGo: sounds like he'd be a great support
[3:53:47] azaley_dayinghe: But now it never works
[3:53:50] rilsolo: better to lose trying something rather than be tsm every time they're at worlds
[3:53:59] BUBBLESHINOBI: @MonteCristo am I ill to be a huge razork fan and wanting to support fnatic but also being the biggest humanoid hater ever I cant stand his attitude towards seriousness in the game
[3:54:23] dianstyle: was Tsm CEO saying they were buying a spot in LCK or LPL?
[3:54:30] dianstyle: what happened after that
[3:54:33] Draexor: im a Perkz fan, but this split was not it. they have to find some champ he s better at
[3:54:46] azaley_dayinghe: Better not be 0/6 than trying desperate moves.
[3:55:37] GAGGINGONSHREKSGIANTCROC: Perkz is fantastic, he just needs to work on communication, map awareness, laning, vision control, csing, poking, landing skillshots, objective control, early game, mid game, late game, ganking, and getting kills.

[3:56:16] YungPecku: man it hurts so much to watch Perkz
[3:56:36] DrakeAcula: FISH SENSES OR SOMETHING
[3:56:38] MissingMatter: @dianstyle He stepped out of the spotlight and hoped nobody noticed when they only did the first part of "leaving and going somewhere else."
[3:56:42] myosotismenot: aint no way
