[3:09:02] criticwhospeaksfacts: i mean no lcs team had sports psychologists for the past 10 years, why do they need all of a sudden. I just feel like it's extra services that's really not required and once they introduce it, people will rely on it
[3:09:19] vogue_hommes: MF slayyy

[3:10:57] Puff1nz: ??? sports psych have been major news in esports for over 5 years. ppl talk about it, you just dont pay attention lol @criticwhospeaksfacts
[3:11:03] kebimbimbab: oh

[3:13:37] Puff1nz: @criticwhospeaksfacts If you don't really watch why have an opinion or comment on the topic? The sports psych that Stunt was about earlier (Noah) was literally considered like Jesus for struggling teams
[3:13:43] criticwhospeaksfacts: do you think they should make a pre-requisite, you have to play games before you treat e-sports pro players?
[3:13:44] adnips: uhhh?
[3:13:58] adnips: is bro ok
[3:14:00] Puff1nz: everyone would bring him on in like szn 6-9 if ur team was struggling mentally

[3:24:57] Nyovie: @MrSleepyGoldfish there are 3 useful settings. Target champions only, Treat target champions only as a toggle, and Auto attack on cursor
[3:24:58] voidmoons: i cant remember specifially
[3:25:18] 23vulture: !opgg
[3:25:18] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/homeslicer-NA1
[3:25:21] MrSleepyGoldfish: oh okay, ill look into those
[3:25:25] MrSleepyGoldfish: thank you :)
[3:25:26] noaran: there is no way to turn off attack on right click, right?
[3:25:47] ascuane: out of curiosity, has anyone in chat played riots card game? Legends of runeterra
[3:25:51] criticwhospeaksfacts: @Nyovie which bindings do you use to auto only champions. I don't want to unbind any other setting i just use default
[3:25:53] voidmoons: i think its player attack move click
[3:25:58] noaran: @ascuane yes
[3:26:00] adnips: @ascuane i used to
[3:26:32] voidmoons: @criticwhospeaksfacts i use one of my mouse buttons for that
[3:26:36] MrSleepyGoldfish: @criticwhospeaksfacts mine is ` key but i cna't find it in keybinds and don't know how to change it
[3:26:39] Nyovie: @criticwhospeaksfacts Mine are a bit weird xD I have space bar as Target champs only and just use Y camera lock to recenter my character
[3:26:52] MrSleepyGoldfish: @Nyovie oh that's smart
[3:27:04] ascuane: @noaran i started playing it like 2 weeks ago and now riot announced that theyre stopping pvp patches Sadge
[3:27:06] noaran: i use space bar for attack move
[3:27:11] ascuane: such a bummer
[3:27:13] criticwhospeaksfacts: @Nyovie that seems complex
[3:27:31] noaran: i also only have like 3h in that game lol
[3:27:44] MrSleepyGoldfish: attack move and target champ only are different right?
[3:27:46] exuvium: corki w Despairge
[3:27:47] noaran: but i mostly played pvp
[3:27:51] ascuane: @noaran OMEGALUL  oh
[3:27:52] criticwhospeaksfacts: @MrSleepyGoldfish yes dif
[3:28:11] adnips: @ascuane they used to have a pvp draft mode like hearthstone arena, when they removed that I figured the game wouldnt last long
[3:28:20] criticwhospeaksfacts: @stunt wat hotkey do u use to auto champs only
[3:28:28] vrgambit: I like sylas name
[3:28:31] ascuane: @adnips oh that sucks
[3:28:50] ascuane: i just got into it, researched meta decks and stuff and build one, now ive read there post and im sad
[3:28:58] ascuane: Smoge
[3:29:31] adnips: it was a solid game but they refused to market it
[3:29:57] ascuane: it has byfar the best actual system and design out of every card game thats popular rn
[3:30:01] Nyovie: Drake lead kinda huge
[3:30:09] noaran: he has it every 5 mins
[3:30:34] adnips: can you CC herald while it's being driven
[3:30:57] criticwhospeaksfacts: man the enemy team are actually good. synergy is insane. for once you see challengers playing like pro teams

[4:32:48] Hydr_OH: hwei support in low elo is so fun, especially if you're against it and they don't know what they're doing hehe
[4:32:53] voidmoons: what kinda dating app
[4:33:00] pollowie: so the past few years i played support and jungle. But lately I was so tired of my adc's (or other sololaners) just losing the game on theirself so I started playing ADC last week. That role is SO easy!! OK I still lose lane alot because I have alot to learn, but when I lose lane, I just play ultra safe, push a wave, try to help my team abit. So I recognize my role as ADC is over and adapt to more of a support plzystyle. And we win more often with that. So easy role

[4:49:07] AllOfGenius: is that the general consensus?
[4:49:08] voidmoons: he denied that cannon so much

[5:04:17] call_me_teaa: @blugoriking i mean nooo? i really hate going against him tho

[5:04:46] criticwhospeaksfacts: hwei seraphine?
[5:04:58] zat798: Honestly I've forgotten they have a teemo the entire game
[5:05:04] call_me_teaa: everytime i see a pyke on the enemy team i start foaming at the mouth like a rabid dog
[5:05:05] VdoTapes: @dudebromaximus I’ve noticed , I will try doing that next time tho cause he does feel rewarding when you get a pull and stun combo in
[5:05:06] criticwhospeaksfacts: wait they have a teemo? lol in challenger?
[5:05:35] TwitchTime89: why not?
[5:05:38] criticwhospeaksfacts: man hwei adc on stunt is just disgustingly op

[5:06:01] DudeBroMaximus: @blugoriking mid roam is great with Pyke cos bot will be paranoid you're still in bot bushes the whole time
[5:06:11] DudeBroMaximus: So sometimes they don't ping missing
[5:06:19] criticwhospeaksfacts: i only came to stream now so idk what i missed out on but stun is killing it
[5:06:29] zat798: Teemo is real good, just hasn't had an impact this game at least it feels like
[5:06:38] VdoTapes: @call_me_teaa I actually wanted to try teemo but a lot of people keep telling me no
[5:06:41] TwitchTime89: vibee
[5:06:50] DudeBroMaximus: Teemo just can't come online into some comps, feelsbad
[5:07:00] VdoTapes: @dudebromaximus definitely will keep that in mind
[5:07:34] blewbeary: eyeball + lava takes up whole river
[5:07:36] TwitchTime89: GG!!!!!!!
[5:07:36] call_me_teaa: @blugoriking I MEAN you can try whatever you want x) if you're learning the game and only playing normals, any champion can be played supp if you're brave enough, just pick whatever you want and have fun

[7:44:25] quincy_chan: cupicNoted
[7:44:26] Deglam: is anti-heal buffed? if not then it was a bad item choice HmmCouncil
[7:45:05] cloudydaisies: ono
[7:45:13] exuvium: Despairge

[7:45:46] Deglam: wawa wawa wawa Looking
[7:46:30] denunciator: bla
[7:46:50] Breedlove00: @SimeonDelev Nah the champ is unironically quite strong and oppressive now. Bad players lower the winrate
[7:47:27] SimeonDelev: every champ is quite strong when used properly, no?
[7:47:38] quincy_chan: hwei still below 50% win rate? cupicSip
[7:47:51] Deglam: @Breedlove00 cars are super safe bad drivers make the mortality rate look high
[7:47:53] RlyBadPlyer: I'm not sure I'm quite a shurelya's believer

[7:49:39] Breedlove00: @quincy_chan It's 50% in plat+, and approaching 50 in even lower elos, whereas it was like 43% before lmao. It's totally different than a champ like lux with a way lower skillcap. Winrates are never all that matters
[7:49:39] danix22x: i feel like its so useless in lane

[8:11:40] criticwhospeaksfacts: huge window
[8:11:58] BaneBladeV: yeah it's supposed to be. a mobile wind wall is a mini-ultimate.
[8:12:12] BaneBladeV: omni-directional too
[8:12:15] criticwhospeaksfacts: blitz can hook 3 times within that 30sec.
[8:12:34] Srdjan91: @criticwhospeaksfacts good

[8:17:29] truly_ancient_truly_evil: dont the skin effects distract you
[8:18:11] criticwhospeaksfacts: is it worth for lucian to just freeze so samira would be at like 40 cs, or take turret plates?
[8:18:19] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[8:18:23] g0ff: get dey ass stunna man!

[8:19:35] Deglam: yes
[8:20:14] truly_ancient_truly_evil: idk about better but shes more fun to me
[8:20:17] braumski985: @criticwhospeaksfacts freezing is just so rarely viable now unless its really early (lvl 3)  ormelee vs melee where hitting the turret is less realistic
[8:20:18] Deglam: maokai woke up?
[8:20:53] Deglam: OUCH
[8:21:08] Deglam: is never that easy
[8:21:17] criticwhospeaksfacts: lucian just 3 shots with 1 combo

[8:22:02] Deglam: miserable Looking
