[2:36:59] SimonMaybeRiven: o i wanted to ask
[2:37:02] Amaresu_: @ItzGraphicZ she s good if you can snowball or get to 2 core spike ahead of the curve or you re vs 0 armor but vs 2+ tanks/armor in general and azir/gragas/poppy/all the enchanters counter her.. she s useless. so it depends on draft

[2:38:28] Omnitayz: does riven need to be ahead in most matchups or can she play for teamfights later and go even?
[2:38:32] SimonMaybeRiven: idk it like he cycles through E and W, last hits with E and punishes your cs with Q
[2:38:42] Amaresu_: @ItzGraphicZ still most junglers will weakside you as well. too much autopiloting full clearing or pathing bot every game for 0 reason even if its double enchanter or utiltiy ads like jhin etc FailFish
[2:38:54] Amaresu_: see this graves

[2:51:14] Amaresu_: @ExcaSaber i mean anyone who ever built ravenous builds its instead rn cause ravenous is so ass. 12% lifesteal, not even omnivamp and ad is shit compared to profane which also has lethality..
[2:51:25] Amaresu_: @ExcaSaber they need to buff ravenous ad and make it 18% lifesteal again
[2:51:29] pan_con_chicharr0n: sbd knows whats gonna get nerfed of eclipse?
[2:51:31] Amaresu_: so its actually meaningful lifesteal stacked with dblade

[2:52:28] walle96: what was ur biggest issue with going pro? they perma banned ur riven?

[2:53:00] Amaresu_: @walle96 he plays other champs, not playing riven in comp not the problem, the team he played for wasnt that good that was the problem but he didnt like the lifestyle i think he said.
[2:53:01] SimonMaybeRiven: havey you tried it
[2:53:03] ItzGraphicZ: Bruh where is the Serpents
[2:53:10] ItzGraphicZ: free serpents game
[2:53:12] Amaresu_: @pan_con_chicharr0n zeus and kingen build it on aatrox in pro play bro
[2:53:16] Amaresu_: @pan_con_chicharr0n profane i mean
[2:53:21] walle96: cheers m8
[2:53:55] olddirtyjack: EVERY ad champ is building profane and sunderd seems like it anyway
[2:54:01] Amaresu_: @walle96 his brother plays toplane for 100 thieves in lcs right now tho btw
[2:54:10] pan_con_chicharr0n: @Amaresu_ yeah i saw it but i was still talking about eclipse, profane is too much for me
[2:54:17] ItzGraphicZ: RIVEN Q INTERRACTION WOOO
[2:54:21] Amaresu_: @olddirtyjack yeah they re def the best ad bruiser/fighter items rn for sure besides eclipse.
[2:54:24] pan_con_chicharr0n: ik its a ton of dmg but a fly can kill me
[2:54:29] ItzGraphicZ: they serisously broke something
[2:54:29] Amaresu_: @pan_con_chicharr0n oh
[2:54:35] Amaresu_: yeah i get that
[2:54:48] Amaresu_: riven Q bugged for 10 years classic
[2:54:57] Drascko: Minion block and Qs
[2:54:59] ItzGraphicZ: They deff broke something this season start
[2:55:01] cashbear: @olddirtyjack these items turbobusted thats why lol
[2:55:12] olddirtyjack: riven q bug seems worse this season
[2:55:14] Amaresu_: i dont think eclipse is busted tbh
[2:55:16] Amaresu_: i think its cheap sure
[2:55:17] Drascko: Not multiple times a game and not Q1 Q2s
[2:55:22] Amaresu_: good early spike if you get it first
[2:55:24] ItzGraphicZ: It's been way more common for Q to sideflip or backflip this season
[2:55:28] viochiiii: good morning viper tamiml1Tamimlurk
[2:55:30] ackihuru: tenacity rune still okay? didnt they nerf it
[2:55:36] Amaresu_: and if your champ has shields himself and you stack shield on shield its deceptively tanky
[2:55:42] Gloop2: It was Riven not you. I think you were stuck against tri wall and udyr blocked you, too. So your Q defaulted over the wall? Pathing is wack this season
[2:55:46] olddirtyjack: @Amaresu_ i feel like its half the damage of profane
[2:55:47] SimonMaybeRiven: light work
[2:55:51] Dropsies1: -1
[2:55:51] tka_killerangel: big minion udyr
[2:55:53] Amaresu_: but reality is eclipse and sundered are the only good bruiser items rn
[2:55:58] viochiiii: ggs
[2:56:00] コッド_クンク: gg
[2:56:00] Amaresu_: compared to ap items or tank items
[2:56:07] Amaresu_: or kraken/navori/ldr or the onhit items
[2:56:19] DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO0: i swear my riven does less dmg than yours
[2:56:22] Amaresu_: so ppl build profane on bruisers to do dmg
[2:56:24] KingEdward5: Have you ever played against Qwacker?
[2:56:25] SimonMaybeRiven: viper can u compare youmuus and opportunity
[2:56:27] ifady99i: should i reinstall league ? @Viper
[2:56:32] Amaresu_: @DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO0 build profane hydra :P
[2:56:36] young_riv: riven nerf incoming because of items. feelsbad
[2:56:41] Amaresu_: @DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO0 and dont cancel your autos :P
[2:56:51] KmansTV: whats your go to build
[2:56:54] Amaresu_: they re nerfing sundered and profane
[2:56:57] brandonpz: COPIUM
[2:57:00] Amaresu_: eclipse - as we stand is not getting nerfed
[2:57:02] olddirtyjack: but what do we do as riven to deal with tanks
[2:57:09] zak_vvv: dirk is BROKENN
[2:57:15] SimonMaybeRiven: the 5% move speed on opportunity is similar to the ooc movespeed from youmuus
[2:57:25] Amaresu_: @olddirtyjack flash on their backline, pointless to build to kill them, the longer the game goes you cant
[2:57:25] SimonMaybeRiven: dirk would be good at 1100g
[2:57:27] zak_vvv: im glad everyone hoppin on the train zakvvv1NT
[2:57:33] SimonMaybeRiven: and its somehow 1000g
[2:57:36] boxxyy23: i dont understand how u get away with going lethality
[2:57:40] zak_vvv: top pref
[2:57:41] boxxyy23: with out people ccing u into burst
[2:57:45] Amaresu_: profane does 800 dmg on proc vs sub 50% hp later
[2:57:50] zak_vvv: oops wrong chat lol
[2:57:56] cashbear: @boxxyy23 kill fast get out haha
[2:57:57] SimonMaybeRiven: zak have u fucked around w opportunity
[2:58:00] Amaresu_: @boxxyy23 have to play smart
[2:58:00] boxxyy23: i agree
[2:58:02] Blurstinger: what do you mean by dirk? only dirk or the whole youmus? xD
[2:58:03] zak_vvv: @SimonMaybeRiven yeah i build it
[2:58:12] boxxyy23: Hydra into ?
[2:58:25] whatshezed123: do you go seryldas vs tanks 2nd?
[2:58:25] Amaresu_: yi kat KEKW

[2:58:39] boxxyy23: Uhm grudge seems bad to me
[2:58:41] boxxyy23: so i am confused lol
[2:58:43] Uglydoggy: do yuo still go cleaver?
[2:58:46] e11vn_: no cleaver?
[2:59:04] boxxyy23: I have been rushing Sky in some games>?
[2:59:06] 1DlNlZ: what about the dirk you buy early what do you built into?
[2:59:06] olddirtyjack: cleaver SUCKS
[2:59:15] Amaresu_: shojin rush feels the best for me. obv its more expensive than eclipse and less good for trades/sustain  than sundered but makes you at least feel like you have good cdr on basic abilities
[2:59:26] zak_vvv: they are buffing sheen and essence reaver bacca is going back to rank 1
[2:59:32] Amaresu_: without shojin your cds are actually noticeably longer
[2:59:35] Amaresu_: this ssn
[2:59:46] Amaresu_: @zak_vvv you mean again? reaver was already buffed
[2:59:51] boxxyy23: is the item good because they removed armor runes?
[2:59:52] zak_vvv: again
[2:59:54] Amaresu_: wtf

[3:54:00] kappadecimo: you just brain dead q

[4:00:04] AmonAglar: @Viper why do u often buy a lethality stick that u don't turn into an item? Isn't that slowing your actual items build?
[4:00:26] zixxeN: its a huge damageboost @AmonAglar
[4:00:44] AmonAglar: so is finishing a full item?
[4:00:44] zixxeN: totally worth the cost
[4:00:45] pino1v9: @AmonAglar he wants profane first item but brutalizer is hard to build and tiamat is not that good so he sits on dirk for a good early spikeù
[4:00:46] kappadecimo: @AmonAglar according to him, it's cost efficient and helps with early all ins. he builds it into yomu's later

[4:41:14] billed_cap: @SpeirsLIVE practice in practice tool theres not much to it
[4:41:15] PakuZero: aatrox players legit win by making enemy fall asleep
[4:41:16] Amaresu_: @SpeirsLIVE youtube video with the cancels/fast q on one monitor,. practice tool spam on main monitor

[4:42:13] Sakencyu: holyyyyy
[4:42:24] 50iq50ping: does riven outscale aatroix
[4:42:25] Zeruel_TV: man 3 min ads during the game, really? nah
[4:42:40] Kafkavari: Kafkavari watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[4:42:44] Amaresu_: @Zerutonin its twitch's fault, viper isnt the one pressing a button to do ads mid g ame
[4:42:46] ccrlover: @lolbreezyyy tbh tho, as a top laner, its free elo. specially if ahead, tabis is gg pretty much. im only d3 tho
[4:42:48] birdhousebmx: @Zerutonin you do know those are called 'pre-rolls' right?

[4:44:31] Amaresu_: actual oneshot central on backline with profane serylda
[4:44:46] Amaresu_: zeus literally oneshotted 3 ppl on it in lck towards end of one of the games
[4:44:52] Zeruel_TV: @Amaresu_ couldnt he just manually do ads between games for 3 minutes? then there are no ads for the next 60 minutes expect if he issues them manually
[4:45:48] Amaresu_: @Zerutonin works when your Q is 2 mins but usually Q is longer at this time for him + ppl dodge several times etc so time between games is kinda long-ish rn
[4:45:56] Amaresu_: @Zerutonin but you re not wrong
[4:45:56] balefulsilence: yo moo'sd
[4:46:01] Zeruel_TV: @birdhousebmx pre-rolls are ads that do open for new viewers after opening the stream and can be disabled by the content creator according to twitch. So I am not sure what you were telling me?
[4:46:18] PakuZero: lol
[4:46:42] themerki98: Isn't eclipse better as first item for riven? And go like eclipse, sunderer, profane?
[4:46:45] PakuZero: kayn tired of aatrox just sitting afk in lane? forcing him to participate
[4:46:51] themerki98: @viper
[4:46:54] Amaresu_: @themerki98 eclipse sundered is good 2 core
[4:47:11] Amaresu_: @themerki98 he s just been doing early dirk into profane for last couple streams and likes it

[5:10:15] deisholud420: clapped by kayle?
[5:10:20] blackeeyy: i swear kayle is not that weak early with tempo
[5:10:23] hoolyganlol: kayle is strong actually strong early nowadays with BP, you can't bully her lvl 1 and if you commit she runs you down
[5:10:23] BDX1NOS: gg yop gap?
[5:10:29] BDX1NOS: yop%^
[5:10:43] jonstru: when can you ping teammates ?

[5:11:03] Ratax: @BDX1NOS typo god
[5:11:05] Noxum199: e is doing more dmg based on missing health
[5:11:07] Valiantec: E deals more damage the lower you are
[5:11:07] SadReact: e has missing health %
[5:11:12] Oneminuterice: E does missing hp damage no  thats probably hwy it does so much? + fleet proc
[5:11:25] PakuZero: fleet doesnt deal dmg
[5:11:26] Noxum199: backseaters know!
[5:11:27] xiaominglong: nah u die soon
[5:11:38] Valiantec: @PakuZero ^
[5:11:50] HdtvTh: @ForbiddenZen you'd be surprised what full stacked tempo and passive does lvl 1, it just gets worse vs burst champs like riven since you have no time to stack it before you die after lvl 3, this  is the same yasuo/yone problem, not respecting tempo as asking for a bad time
[5:12:25] ForbiddenZen: @HdtvTh problem is kayle cant walk down riven lvl 1 regardless with conq which is funny
[5:12:30] PakuZero: worth?
[5:12:38] xiaominglong: nah it's not worth
[5:12:43] PakuZero: did kayle flash
[5:12:51] Amaresu_: her slow is lowkey so strong and her ms boost is completely broken especially late game w/ ap and when its maxed out
[5:13:13] PakuZero: yeah its so hard to run her down
[5:13:17] HdtvTh: @ForbiddenZen can happen because she always has boneplaying and you never have it
[5:13:22] Ratax: @Amaresu_ why do kayle top always int in my games then :(
[5:13:31] PakuZero: i actually have to go swifties vs her
[5:13:32] Amaresu_: cause she needs 30 mins to be a chmpa xD
[5:13:36] Amaresu_: Champ *
[5:13:54] Ratax: @Amaresu_ why can't they ever chill and scale
[5:14:00] sxcKayros: higher

[5:14:08] SHARK_QUASAR: riven is shorter
[5:14:08] atlafayon: kayle is very high
[5:14:15] PakuZero: its so long
[5:14:18] ForbiddenZen: @Viper COOLDOWN: 160 / 120 / 80
[5:14:26] SHARK_QUASAR: Kayle is 2min I think
[5:14:29] PakuZero: I didnt realize her ult cd was this long early
[5:14:34] sealnine: Kayle ult cd is like 2x riven
[5:14:50] PakuZero: kayle ult is up now

[5:47:02] ForbiddenZen: @Viper serpent's fang vs kled? yes no
[5:47:08] Amaresu_: @irelina_ if he s really good its hard to kill him cause .. he has 2 hp bars and his remount mechanic is deceptive "tankiness" with the untargetability thingy x 2 etc but .. you can outplay him cause his dmg comes from his W and he has to auto to cs so he puts it on cd.
[5:47:20] Addysix: Can you show video settings for a split sec @Viper  <3
