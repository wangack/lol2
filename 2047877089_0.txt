[0:10:55] iPSGi: pog
[0:11:11] ptrixie: you know skarner is tweaking after that
[0:11:21] Migral500: Oh skarner is friendly
[0:13:36] tizi3pp: nanana el bardo todo mal hizo
[0:13:41] tizi3pp: jajhajajaj
[0:13:51] matadoss: you was right not a good idea
[0:16:25] OrbitalPeacock: o
[0:16:34] squidyjasmine: !opgg
[0:17:46] silentka2001: tamo
[0:17:53] iPSGi: not even close
[0:20:00] tastyshroomz: woke kong
[0:36:23] Pitju99: idk if your team can outdamage mountain soul
[0:38:50] Pitju99: karma ori shields with mountain sounds unbeatable
[0:39:09] Banmoo77: if you did go PTA you might have done damage that you need
[0:40:20] Pitju99: tempo does more this late and its still weak
[0:41:56] ipav999: !title only ap teemo 2024.
[0:41:56] Nightbot: @ipav999 -> The stream title has been updated to: only ap teemo 2024.
[0:43:03] Pitju99: wits instead of qss and attackspeed rune would do a bit more but then more vulnerable
[0:43:24] Pitju99: I know not this game
[0:45:13] Pitju99: tenacity stacking is a bruisers thing
[0:45:16] Pitju99: i agree
[0:46:01] kurufeemo: From my experience it seems that nashors tooth has become less valuable than other options.
[0:46:18] Banmoo77: is electrocute good on teemo now?
[0:46:34] Pitju99: Nashor actually got buffed
[0:46:44] kurufeemo: My 5 recent games were the highest on damage in the game and i played without nashor
[0:46:52] Pitju99: 200 gold for 10 AP is a buff
[0:46:57] Pitju99: faster item
[0:47:07] chokexvi: Hello my friends
[0:47:30] SpringSong: hello
[0:47:35] SpringSong: no more palworld?
[0:47:42] Pitju99: hourglass is worse for sure
[0:47:42] seicozy: yo wassup
[0:47:47] seicozy: hows it going
[0:47:52] Pitju99: so expensive
[0:47:53] kurufeemo: Its still good and it feels fine all the same, but as for the number its better to opt into shroom build
[0:48:12] seicozy: !from
[0:48:21] seicozy: where is ipav from
[0:48:43] kurufeemo: He is russian, but has been denying that for ages already
[0:48:47] Pitju99: @kurufeemo shroom build has inflated damage charts compared to nashor
[0:48:52] kazurfel: @ipav999 lichbane still bad?
[0:48:53] seicozy: davai davai
[0:49:12] chokexvi: Oppa
[0:50:38] kurufeemo: Shroom are longer ranged than autos thats what i say. Shrooms are aldo aoe. Also malignance is quite good too
[0:50:38] Banmoo77: @ipav999 is electrocute good on teemo now?
[0:51:10] Pitju99: @kurufeemo yeah shrooms have their own merits but you're missing his point
[0:52:36] suppaahh: @kurufeemo its like he didnt listen at all to what ipav said
[0:53:00] kurufeemo: @pitju99 what i mean is that using shrooms in a fight is often more possible than dealing damage with consistant autoing. You will have to itemize defensively every game to actually be able to run and hit them with nashros. While shroom build allows you to keep your distance
[0:54:00] Pitju99: @kurufeemo That's factual, but we were arguing about your "it does more damage" point
[0:54:33] suppaahh: in high elo people just avoid shrooms or red trinket it
[0:54:34] Pitju99: it also depends on the game
[0:54:58] Pitju99: more ranged characters, more towards shroom build, usually
[0:55:07] Pitju99: more melees, more nashor
[0:55:25] kurufeemo: Thus it does more damage since you can't auto. Although I agree shrooms often only provide poke damage which doesn't lead anywhere, but that's a different issue
[0:55:30] SpringSong: @kurufeemo lol are you sure about that shroom is a good tool for team fight? :D maybe in low tier that could work but higher elo they'll clean areas before you  could do fight so shroom in team fight almost impossible to do something
[0:55:56] Pitju99: Shroom is actually a good teamfight tool, but literally while fighting and not before
[0:56:07] Pitju99: like in the middle of a fight its good
[0:56:26] SpringSong: I never see anyone go on shroom that you put while teamfight happens
[0:56:36] SpringSong: also teamfight not stay long enough
[0:56:50] Pitju99: just them having to avoid it makes it useful, mostly for your team
[0:56:58] Pitju99: it can zone enemies
[0:56:58] Banmoo77: i mainly shroom to push lanes and vision :D
[0:57:00] SpringSong: 3-5 sec to teamfight ends  so who gona walk on ur shroom they just saw u put it
[0:57:06] kurufeemo: @springsong they still step on one or two every teamfight
[0:57:59] Pitju99: it's zoning like ori ball or viktor stun field
[0:58:05] Pitju99: but it stays there
[0:58:10] Pitju99: and u have multiple
[0:58:22] kurufeemo: They need to at least turn their attention to it and actively remember the placement while also teamfight properly. It takes a lot of experience and great combat awarness to keep track of everything plus the shrooms @springsong
[0:58:37] Pitju99: the problem is when nobody can protect shroom and they can oracle it
[0:58:57] Pitju99: but while fighting it does stuff
[0:59:14] suppaahh: @kurufeemo bro its high elo, they all have combat swareness
[0:59:32] SpringSong: @kurufeemo what elo you play in cuz this sounds like silver-gold type of game
[0:59:36] kurufeemo: !elo
[0:59:42] kurufeemo: !rank
[0:59:59] Pitju99: Even if they don't step on it, it still has some value as a zoning tool
[1:00:04] kurufeemo: @springsong emerald 2. Though I havent played for a couple of years
[1:00:08] Pitju99: not saying itll oneshot them
[1:00:46] SpringSong: @kurufeemo thats says why you call shroom a good teamfight tool good luck when you reach high dia +
[1:00:56] suppaahh: yea hes talking from an emarald  player's view
[1:02:02] DoubleNeilix: just stand on shroom
[1:02:03] kurufeemo: @springsong alright, but are you saying it from experience? Are you a high diamond player that has learned through gameplay that shrooms is a bad teamfight tool?
[1:02:18] DontFeedPenguins: grubs gone
[1:03:38] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[1:04:12] SpringSong: @kurufeemo yeap dia 1 and shroom isnt dmg resource you can trust and almost never usefull dmg in teamfights shroom is a good tool as a vision but for dmg its not a trustable
[1:05:21] Pitju99: well in terms of teamfight tools is it still not the best taimo got, unless we call autos a tf tool
[1:05:27] suppaahh: u can literally watch master + games and see that teemo players are impacting by autoing not shrooms
[1:05:28] Pitju99: its subjective
[1:06:50] kurufeemo: I hit masters on teemo some years ago and truth be told I can't remember how it was in teamfights. But it almost seems like you are saying teemos ultimate is rather useless @springsong
[1:07:41] Pitju99: it's much better against squishy champions
[1:07:44] SpringSong: @kurufeemo useless as a trustfull dmg tool and focus on its dmg
[1:07:54] Pitju99: as u said bruisers can just walk through it
[1:08:45] Pitju99: it actually does zone enemy mage/adc
[1:09:29] sukajwtin: dont need to finish liandry? mask is eneugh?
[1:09:31] SpringSong: @Pitju99 not even only bruisers some supports like alistar rakan tresh blitzcrank ali nau leo and some big shielders like karma lux seraph etc.
[1:10:41] teemolingus: @ipav999 how do you see the build of 4 mask like young fappy?
[1:10:58] Pitju99: even in high tear teamfights are not always organized like that, in pro play that would happen 100% of the time but soloq, not always
[1:11:11] Pitju99: maybe still most of the time but occasionally its really good
[1:11:21] Amarvorn: BIGFROG
[1:11:23] sukajwtin: ah ok, ty
[1:11:31] Pitju99: and on those occasions it can solo win fight
[1:11:43] Amarvorn: peepoComfy
[1:12:38] Pitju99: not to mention once bruiser dies teamfight still continues
[1:13:07] teemolingus: @ipav999 how do you see the build of 4 mask like young fappy?
[1:15:11] Pitju99: @springsong btw saying it's unreliable is completely fair, but it's not like you give up all your dmg with a shroom focused build
[1:15:20] Pitju99: its just a slight tradeoff
[1:15:57] Rosencauck: think of it like you're buying a sorcerer's pot for 100 gold less
[1:16:06] Rosencauck: 12% damage boost is more than a sorc pot
[1:16:19] Rosencauck: and it lasts until you sell it
[1:17:14] SpringSong: @Pitju99 nah you can do shroom build its up to you but for me I'll stick aa builds until shroom get reworked or changed to a reliable dmg source
[1:17:30] wonder_vat_land: Hi, does mr streamer still make the excel sheet?
[1:18:12] kazurfel: @ipav999 is void staff better than cryptbloom?
[1:18:21] sukajwtin: 4/2/0 time to blaze
[1:18:30] 0ld_Grumpy_Gamer: Teemo die last patch...item can make him decent late game,,,but...off
[1:18:31] Mimo469: pack it boys
[1:19:04] Pitju99: @springsong imo what it mostly gives up is laning phase impact and thats very important for winning
[1:19:24] DoubleNeilix: rowzkiEverytime
[1:19:29] MeechanZ: victorious jarvan?
[1:19:33] Amarvorn: peepoSit
[1:19:34] MeechanZ: is that a redo of the splash?
[1:19:45] MeechanZ: looks like him
[1:20:10] Pitju99: @springsong I never said I'm against nashor just that theres room for both depending on the game
[1:20:24] MeechanZ: yeah victorious j4 was S1
[1:20:49] Mimo469: i sold my acc w the j4 and janna skin rip

[1:41:52] XunxonaP: What is fate doing

[1:54:04] ssensuousness: Teemo is broken
[1:54:06] GAB3DI: when did lich bane become good on teemo? i know it wasnt built on teemo before
[1:54:10] antroz92: @brian919 elec playstyle

[1:54:30] brian919: @antroz92 ahh i see
[1:55:12] 4Nox2: LUL
[1:55:24] SpringSong: @GAB3DI cuz before teemos burst wasnt enough to kıll squishies but s14 items kinda helps to oneshot
[1:55:25] kurufeemo: Now who else want to say that mushrooms are bad after this neeko?
[1:55:32] funhero2: doesnt stormsurge fit right into the build
[1:55:37] funhero2: u oneshot and get movespeed to run away

[2:09:23] SpringSong: 14 lv graves 11 lv teemo kekw
[2:10:52] SpringSong: yea that 2 oracle always support and jungle and thats not even cuz teemo if there is no teemo jungle and support goes for oracle anyways
[2:11:02] JC75_: 3 farsights in one team that one game wtf
[2:11:05] JC75_: has it been buffed?
[2:12:06] JC75_: rumble surely
[2:12:08] JC75_: banned riven
[2:12:08] SpringSong: dog mid I guess
[2:12:41] SpringSong: yea mid and adc need to go for blue trinket
[2:13:09] leagueoflegoboy99: what about the tank teemo with heartsteel
[2:13:17] leagueoflegoboy99: does that teemo good
[2:13:21] leagueoflegoboy99: do good*
[2:13:22] SpringSong: but if againts teemo yea 4 oracle best one 3 is good enough
[2:13:47] SpringSong: @leagueoflegoboy99 ı dont think heartsteel is a good anymore
[2:14:21] Takedu: Hey @ipav999 is Teemo still ok after the recent nerfs?
[2:15:25] ZloyIndy: hello teemo enjoyers Keepo 7
[2:17:01] Draenom: I can feel the r nerfs early a lot though
[2:18:39] Draenom: 5 more seconds recharge on every rank.. lvl 6-10 I can really fel the diff
[2:20:01] Knayten: is taking movespeed shard in runes good for taimo?
[2:20:32] Draenom: it's overkill, if u want to be fast get swifties & 2 points in W
[2:20:48] Draenom: maybe even celerity & gathering storm secondary runes
[2:23:52] Knayten: sounds reasonable, I guess I'm just a movespeed addict when, also to compensate my bad movement
[2:24:04] razer_mon: MONKAS
[2:24:11] Draenom: I do the same, I run swifties a lot
[2:24:26] razer_mon: U AND RIKEN playing together
[2:24:30] razer_mon: OOOO
[2:24:50] Knayten: btw was the haunting guise build never actually worth or did something change?
[2:25:21] razer_mon: KEKL
[2:25:33] Aldurfus: @razer_mon ipavChad
[2:26:06] razer_mon: @Aldurfus ipavChad ipavChad ipavChad
[2:26:39] Knayten: spread the taimo "love"
[2:27:48] Aldurfus: you killed the dog ipavKEK
[2:27:54] Knayten: naafiri? KEKW
[2:28:34] Knayten: very kind of him to deliver the double buff
[2:30:13] jamalshea: do we have at least 1 build for teemo now?
[2:31:34] Knayten: casual full dcap buy
[2:32:42] Knayten: Susge
[2:34:21] Knayten: magician build
[2:34:26] PineappleOverlord9k: that poor rakan seeing his ally die so fast
[2:34:31] DoubleNeilix: gg
[2:34:54] ssensuousness: AP is so fun right?
[2:35:29] Knayten: was the 4 mask build ever good or did it get nerfed?
[2:36:43] xavisonline: Yeah palworld is looking like a typical early access pump and dump, unfortunately
[2:37:24] Ein23: zoomers love base building
[2:37:40] Knayten: do they?
[2:38:09] MeechanZ: define dumped
[2:38:26] MeechanZ: cuz they have a roadmap of things they are fixing
[2:38:32] funhero2: itd be pretty stupid of them to dump the game too
[2:38:39] funhero2: itd shatter any consumer confidence for future games
[2:39:00] PineappleOverlord9k: @xavisonline its just like their other early access games where they have a good base but it will lead to absolutely nowhere
[2:39:30] PineappleOverlord9k: i mean they dumped craftopia basically shits been out for 4 years and still in early access? somethings fishy af
[2:39:33] MeechanZ: I mean its early access
[2:39:37] ssensuousness: Is the typical service game that becomes better along the time
[2:39:38] MeechanZ: they're working on end game stuff
[2:40:15] PineappleOverlord9k: craftopia has also bee working on endgame stuff for 4 years
[2:40:26] PineappleOverlord9k: you know, their other EA game...
[2:40:28] Knayten: now that you mention it I got some vocab to review
[2:40:29] MeechanZ: how many devs does it have?
[2:40:42] xavisonline: @PineappleOverlord9k yea that's what I mean. Hype will die, players plateau, incentive is gone cuz you've already made a kazillion bucks
[2:40:43] PineappleOverlord9k: they have enough to have 4 EA games apparently

[2:48:33] PineappleOverlord9k: welp rip jungle

[2:50:55] funhero2: poison doesnt kill? thats wild
[2:51:12] Bey_Company: not worth
[2:51:36] funhero2: amumu lost a wave, its not terrible
[2:51:52] Bey_Company: ok noted

[3:13:29] napstamonty: it was good game, enemies r selfish lol
[3:13:33] freddy613: so you just deal with having no way to deal with ridiculous shielding like that ivern?
[3:13:57] freddy613: or go serpent's fang like some heathen

[3:53:28] Knayten: seems a guy named stans did a lot of conquering Kappa

[3:57:01] brid96: yes and they run it like a business
[3:57:45] freddy613: ai becomes self aware and chooses to cease existing instead of dealing with our shit'
[3:58:00] GaldrixCenturion: can't disagree with that, but the "normal" people are still at the point where where they come from is a big part of their identities, most immigrants in my country are still quite connected to their country of origin and usually seek out similar people
[3:58:03] freddy613: just deletes itself
[3:58:25] Knayten: or deletes all of us monkaSHAKE
