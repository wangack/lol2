[0:26:32] murdoch____: you are always looking at bottom of chat windows
[0:26:50] Blueslimey: This is twitch not a game xDD Its better to have it at the bottom left since its closer to chat
[0:26:59] AlexanderStark: twitch isn't a game, this is real life
[0:27:01] VTVtheNousagi: @Cowsep can i tag
[0:27:01] Blueslimey: "Chat" points so I can use the points for chat

[0:27:46] AlexanderStark: KEKL
[0:27:54] faultymuse: I mean if it's not actually related to chat much then put it wherever. But if it's specifically related to chat it should go near chat
[0:28:05] MasterKoosh: man I remember the set for extra income for dragon kills paid out
[0:28:08] xstren: make them clickable to open the game and purchase something lol

[0:28:35] FractureLock: You can't buy cow armor with them?
[0:28:39] normanthesilly: Good. I like knowing that the points are pointless. I'd hate to have to figure out what to do with them

[0:41:08] Blueslimey: Can you explain the builds? what are the main builds etc ? @Cowsep
[0:41:16] tiltuar: i feel like you need attack speed instead of sunderer

[0:46:44] Blueslimey: why is it box box and not actual Korean? was that your own choice or is the english client just like that? @Cowsep
[0:47:34] WujuSenshi: THE CRITS
[0:47:35] WujuSenshi: THE CHUNKS

[0:50:23] faultymuse: "theater mode" just means hide chat. Or move chat below the player. The player itself can't really do that on its own
[0:50:28] DaoUnchained: I believe in you cowdad :)

[0:51:19] Dracomante_: thank uuu!!
[0:51:49] faultymuse: Ahh that's not what my twitch does very interesting. In any case its modifying things outside the player you can't really do what you want
[0:51:56] nasus_tumbado: m o o o
[0:51:59] MisterSynystyr23: @Cowsep what is your biggest complaint about support rn from a jg perspective?
[0:52:19] arkanian1: what are you making?
[0:52:19] BabbaDu: whatre you using it for atm?
[0:52:29] kenflagio: Webbplatsen kan inte nåswww.cowsep.com tog för lång tid på sig att svara.
[0:52:38] brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd: how many cows have you killed in osrs?
[0:52:50] kenflagio: Is your website down?

[0:54:29] 0GodrickTheGrafted0: xdd
[0:54:31] faultymuse: @cowsep you'll need a CNAME dns record to alias it and the webserver probably needs to know too
[0:55:52] faultymuse: Not sure what exactly "proxy redirect" means but you 1000% need to do something to DNS to make it work. CNAME probably the easiest
[0:55:55] Oplawlz: where's your emotional support malph from the last game? xD
[0:56:17] Dracomante_: i know u love tiamat rush from years ago, buuuut.. is somehow Bruiser Yi some hidden adction that u push urself away from? hehe i dream with Bruiser Yi
[0:56:25] brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd: what ever happeded to your i like to moove it moove it song
[0:56:41] faultymuse: You might have software that just manages the DNS for you though
