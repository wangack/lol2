[3:32:32] bomaye_dk: mhy guy had 10 different abillites on realse
[3:32:45] narnsberg: @bomaye_dk That's not true. He got 3 buffs in 3 patches. His win rate was lowest in high elo
[3:33:20] narnsberg: The only reason he was viable in low elo was people not understanding how easy he was to kill
[3:33:35] bomaye_dk: it was the same with yummi when she got out, every new champ have insane fucking kits. like very hard to balance
[3:34:05] bomaye_dk: thats realy the problem, like how do u balance a champ with 10 different abilites
[3:34:07] Lume_OSRS: He's gonna be the new Aphelios, a good Hwei can 1v9 in like Plat, but higher elo its easy enough to play around him. Despite ridiculous range.
