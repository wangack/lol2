[3:40:07] alpaci99: is that drx or drx prestige?
[3:40:19] The_Only_Royal_Duck: Hey BrokenBlade, I'm a aatrox otp and was wondering when you think trading ignite for TP works best for his match ups . Is it more around your team comp or laning match up?
[3:40:20] only_7: drx
[3:40:21] emotionaladc: i think normal @alpaci99
[3:40:22] messiahpihlmann: Hey BB, is is true that you cost TSM 3k when you spilled coffee on your keyboard during a game? XD

[3:43:46] memoli9436: damn
[3:43:54] OuterRaven: As a pleb viewer I don't see the appeal of top lane Udyr, he controls the lane but doesn't seem to do much once the laning phase is over
