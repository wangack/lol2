[0:59:11] WolfZain: Annie xdd
[0:59:18] bamsamalis: rewatch angle
[0:59:20] shampok: Jungle is the most influential role tho
[0:59:24] ihave2023visionfearme: against zac and noc ? probably not KEKW
[0:59:55] CaiusBloodRaven: xdd
[0:59:55] KilluaLucifer: meanwhile enemy jungler is hovering top for a cheeky 3 mins and holding me off csing at all
[1:00:14] Arhil120: AVENGERS
[1:00:18] Ruinyy: that didnt hit tho
[1:00:19] warpten54: jungle should get filled because riot managed to make it so the game is not enjoyable anyways xdd
[1:00:20] Kriptic3ye: what happens when your bot lane is losing? how does jungle play for objectives?
[1:00:24] uzumakiyao: how did that land lmao
[1:00:25] ScarPlayz12: VeryCat

[1:00:56] hashbrowns117: Do UK the 40-40-20 rule in league. Jungle role is the reason for the 40-40 percentages
[1:01:00] bamsamalis: its impossible to play jungle if support is gapped
[1:01:12] Ego681: !build
[1:01:12] Nightbot: It changes everygame. I'll release a guide or something soon.
[1:01:13] uzumakiyao: @halmtl1 xdd
[1:01:13] ScarPlayz12: @halmtl1 GIGACHAD
[1:01:25] A1z3n7: THAT IS CAP you can play jgl with sup gap
[1:01:26] Ego681: do you ever build profane hydra spear
[1:01:27] ihave2023visionfearme: had a botlane of a miss fortune and pyke go a collective 9/33 together
[1:01:29] KilluaLucifer: thats impossible for everyone bosds
[1:01:29] mepango: MODS  permaban him so he can focus on class and not be a loser like rest of us
[1:01:34] WunWunWunWun_: I'd win. GIGACHAD
[1:01:34] Zerruno: If there is a lane jg would be dependant with would be mid
[1:01:41] ihave2023visionfearme: they then blamed me and the other winning lanes
[1:01:44] justliyo: True af last night i won a game (Trundle) with veigo and we carried EASILYYY
[1:01:50] KilluaLucifer: jungle isnt impossible u can just lock in graves and full clear and then one shot late game
[1:01:54] Kriptic3ye: yeah agreed, as a jungle if you have 3 losing lanes and they don’t make it gank able then it’s unplayable for jungle
[1:01:56] Arhil120: hwei gaming
[1:01:56] hammoud1299: They have a hwei on the enemy team boss, you cant lose
[1:01:57] galm1: 30 30 40
[1:01:58] bamsamalis: like if the enemy support is following you around at the map and youre getting 1v4d in your own jungle while no one is reacting
[1:01:59] halmtl1: We're in an exam im supposed to be writing a big text i said spear shot it better
[1:02:22] KilluaLucifer: that applies to every role
[1:02:22] vPidgey: you've made me go form a udyr otp to pantheon thoughts?
[1:02:23] KilluaLucifer: basically
[1:02:23] LeDutchBoii: Honestly love the fact that Sundered Sky is even more buggy on PBE now, it never goes off CD so you can proc it only once per champion per game
[1:02:27] bamsamalis: no thats fine
[1:02:27] shampok: Its winnable!
[1:02:27] KilluaLucifer: that applies to every role boss
[1:02:32] hashbrowns117: Do UK the 40-40-20 rule in league. Jungle role is the reason for the 40-40 percentages

[1:02:39] samaju22: hello spear can you please do your australian impression again it made me laugh so much (ps i am australian)
[1:02:46] Alkaline_Edge: I'm p sure that on average 3 winning lanes = win regardless of jungle inting, if adc ints it's lost most of the time
[1:02:47] warpten54: @Spear_Shot you fucking weeb why do you have epic seven lobby background music on
[1:02:50] bamsamalis: but if the enemy support is roaming whole game and the laners are gapped too, then its unplayable
[1:02:52] galm1: 30 30 40 hashbrowns
[1:02:52] Atroxos16: happens often enough in lower elos Boss
[1:03:01] Zerruno: ZED99 would carry this
[1:03:04] mepango: @Spear_Shot bro listening to E7 lobby music AH HELL NAW
[1:03:04] KilluaLucifer: how would you solve that issue boss

[1:03:32] ReaperTed: @hangzoed12 hiii
[1:03:38] byre_stein: arent toplaners better junglers than the jungle mains?
[1:03:40] VraelElda: Did you change your mind on shojin?
[1:03:42] hangzoed12: HAH HAH HAH
[1:03:43] arbytes: what in the autism was that
[1:03:48] bateri_boi: Boss are you calm?
[1:03:49] galm1: In NA it's jungle and adc that is the least played and gets filled
[1:03:57] hangzoed12: @ReaperTed catKISS 2nd best MODS
[1:04:01] KilluaLucifer: The issue is the jungle role is unintuitive to play, and has a few knowledge checks
[1:04:06] Alkaline_Edge: do unranked to challenger playing panth jungle to kick jungle mains in the balls
[1:04:11] Kriptic3ye: yes but laners also often die to warded ganks, and perma shove and get ganked not learning their lesson, also making it impossible for you to gank
[1:04:12] Zerruno: Autofill is the worst shit ever

With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.

Atreus now opposes the divine as Pantheon reborn, his unbreakable will fueling the fallen Aspect’s weapons on the field of battle.
