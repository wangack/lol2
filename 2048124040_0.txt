They would need to make his ap playstyle different from his ad one, or else it would be pointless. Giving him reasonable AP ratio on W, or giving him movement speed from ap, that would convert to ad from passive, could be more reasonable than just ap ratio on q

[2:22:37] sheepmuffin: blue side is  better angle
[2:22:45] Automataton: @xslowmakerx dont need the ingame

[2:22:53] TheeRingmaster: you can see someone coming from opening on blue side because of screen angle. you cant really see it from red side standing in same spot

[9:26:37] nubishtryhard: The problem with hecarim, in my opinion, is that he is a all in champ. If his all in doesnt work then he will get annihilated pretty fast. If you want to survive then you build bruiser items but then you lack dmg. If you want to kill enemies fast you build assasin items but then you lack hp/defense. Playing Hecarim feels like a double edged sword.

[9:39:05] lagmr: @Dantes there was a point last season you were 300 average viewers and stuck masters bc of heca nerfs, being chall rn doesn't mean youre not a phenophenomenal heca player it just means you need to find itemization that compcompletely defines the meta  like you always have FeelsStrongMan
[9:39:05] ItsStiwn: Dantes, only assassin hec with profane really feels like a build, and even that feels mediocre at best
[9:39:06] 4bsolut0: did the map changes affect hecarim too much?
