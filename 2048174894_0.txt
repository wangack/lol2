[1:55:25] teemolingus: teemo needs buffs its a fact
[1:55:46] chuuu: Yeah he went to like 46% winrate
[1:55:50] chuuu: Something stupid like that
[1:55:54] chakrahere: Taimo, what do you think about shadowflame item passive as 35% extra damage for damage over time effects.. is it good on Teemo ?

[1:59:57] hotbab3_: Hi ipav, can you explain to my stupid silver brain, how come teemo isn't buffed when he's never picked in LCS.
[2:02:40] knowndepth: backseat gaming but ctrl a delete over new any day
[2:03:20] pikapika_666_: @hotbab3_ because he is stong in silver, where the majority of players are.
[2:03:21] Lazynameross: so yall need to have the enchanter talk right now
[2:03:34] daj_o: ok so ur liking shadowflame more then void staff?

[2:06:26] hotbab3_: @pikapika_666_ i get most players are in silver and gold but i still dont get it
[2:07:11] cuscus9214: why chinese and not korean? unless u speak korean already mr Pavm
[2:07:13] cuscus9214: ??
[2:07:18] Lazynameross: i cant remember who explained it, either phreak or august
[2:07:53] Lazynameross: if a champ is super annoying/hard to deal with in low elo and the counterplay is legit just "get better" that means the game gets abandoned
[2:08:10] daj_o: the lichbane into shadowflame, do u max ur Q after e? or still W
[2:08:11] pikapika_666_: @hotbab3_ there are champs which cannot be played well on silver level, but need higher skill level. Those beat temo in higher tier.
[2:08:22] Lazynameross: so if you want to actually have a playerbase you need to make changes for just low elo sometimes
[2:09:03] Lazynameross: cuz the low player either is frustrated failing to be good enough to beat whatever champ or gives up because they know theyll likely never get good enough
[2:09:06] hotbab3_: okay it makes kinda sense. im just so super bias to teemo i want him to be broken af so i can climb :)
[2:10:05] Lazynameross: tbf if hes broken then everyone else will fight to lock him before you can LUL
[2:10:11] 514484: don't need teemo to be busted, just give back his item variety :(
