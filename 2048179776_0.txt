[0:16:43] kakemomsen1: guys, any1 got clue about PC RAM?  i have 16GB  RAM now, but wanna buy more, can i just buy 32GB RAM and plug it so that i will get 48gb RAM? it would be the same MHZ and CL
[0:17:24] Siegh_Art: Odo daddy big cock long time no see
[0:17:37] booooooooj: @kakemomsen1 its recommended to have two ram sticks of the same capacity
[0:17:38] RaichuTEZ: @kakemomsen1 YEP
[0:17:56] Siegh_Art: @kakemomsen1 just buy 32gb of new same ram
[0:18:12] AWolfieA: @kakemomsen1 depends on how many ram cards your motherboard can take,  some have two, most 4 , some more , check that, other than that, u should be fine
[0:18:12] kakemomsen1: @Siegh_Art yes but does it hurt to have 48gb? thinking of maybe using 3 monitors..
[0:18:13] Caesarbot: @kakemomsen1 Normally yes, though I'm not sure what happens if the sticks are of different capacity (2x8 and 2x16)
[0:18:21] kingacreates: SNIFFA
[0:18:35] IAndrewX: odoamne is from the hood
[0:18:41] ClubstepCZ: @kakemomsen1 Also you should check compatibility with motherboard, some have limited maximum size (I had old computer that only supported 8 GB)
[0:18:42] Siegh_Art: @kakemomsen1 it might cause performance issue from what've read before, its better to dual channel ram espeically if DDR4
[0:18:45] kakemomsen1: @AWolfieA looks like its 4 slots here
[0:18:48] uunluckygamess: is rumble top unbeatable?
[0:18:49] RaichuTEZ: proto feels Deadge
[0:18:58] princeroarke: u are the reason why i ban every match rumble bro
[0:18:59] kakemomsen1: @ClubstepCZ 128gb ram is compatible on the motherboard
[0:19:21] kakemomsen1: @Siegh_Art ok so ill just buy 32 gb then

[0:20:29] kakemomsen1: @Volibread well it would of been the same manufacturer
[0:20:30] ClubstepCZ: @kakemomsen1 but do you need 32 gb actually? I think for playing videogames 16 gb is enough no?
[0:20:46] RaichuTEZ: HUH
[0:20:46] sirbrarne: xdx
[0:20:48] saigeanna: Hello dancing queens
[0:20:52] kakemomsen1: @ClubstepCZ it doesnt cost too much to upgrade to 32gb honestly, 100 eur
[0:20:53] vasy122: odo its   Cryptbloom
[0:20:56] Siegh_Art: @ClubstepCZ depends which game, tarkov needs 32gb but crappy league could work with 8 haha
[0:21:05] AWolfieA: @ClubstepCZ 16 is fine 32 is a bit much 32+ is just overkill unless u do other things like hosting sservers , etc
[0:21:31] MrsKittyhawk: Do i spot a playoff participant in that down left corner? Biiig Champ that dude.
[0:21:31] RaichuTEZ: Life at what cost
