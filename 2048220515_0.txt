[1:03:13] onionjuicer: val is way more of an ego game but its funny cuz league players have the biggest ego of them all
[1:03:18] joejim91: when i play league all i do is make mistakes Aware
[1:03:27] combowombowombo: @HappyStatue yup
[1:03:32] combowombowombo: they do this in all elos
[1:03:58] shakattack786: shakattack786 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! Radiant when?
[1:04:08] N7evenn: if enemy jungle  takes my camps, i take his i have to, ego shit yk
[1:04:11] onionjuicer: yea mistakes snowball in league, technically every round is winnable in val, game isnt winnable at a certain point in league
[1:04:14] aotdstix: LOOK MOM I BECAME A KOREAN JETT
[1:04:46] iamtrucidator: @N7evenn classic and same btw LUL
[1:05:00] combowombowombo: i can see how its painful because the bar now is just aim
[1:05:14] combowombowombo: i think once you hit radiant aim tho it goes back to strats
[1:05:15] aotdstix: onionjuicer and it literally starts with one missed skillshot
[1:05:33] aotdstix: Aware
[1:05:43] onionjuicer: same with league tho, it gets to a point where u just need better mechanics
[1:06:00] teddybudd46: yoo Danny how u doin
[1:06:01] N7evenn: Danny is  Faker  regen
[1:06:06] aotdstix: mechanics take you only so far
[1:06:12] aotdstix: you need brain
[1:06:15] combowombowombo: i think you can plan all you want in league but if you cant hit skill shots its kind of fair statement
[1:06:27] combowombowombo: but you can play champs that minimize it
[1:06:35] onionjuicer: depends on the champ i guess, u can play easy shit and get away with it
[1:06:51] turdgrubs: u can just play sona in league but u always have to aim in val
[1:07:10] teddybudd46: wut we talking bout?
[1:07:21] Saizels: teddy Mango
[1:07:27] sufidaboss: yuumi PepeLaugh
[1:07:33] teddybudd46: Mango ?
[1:07:34] aotdstix: you dont have to always aim though, we laugh about it but fns really has asc aim
[1:07:35] combowombowombo: in pro play strats definitely matter tho
[1:07:37] aotdstix: but look at him
[1:07:43] combowombowombo: thats the whole issue with tenz
[1:07:49] dontspillyo: just aim then
[1:07:51] combowombowombo: hes prob top 10 aimer world
[1:07:58] combowombowombo: but sentinels were struggling because strats sucked
[1:08:13] sufidaboss: @combowombowombo lmao
[1:08:25] aotdstix: thats what i mean, his aim isnt bad, but it's oen of the worst of all the pros out there
[1:08:26] avonx: who was that streamer that was a one trick nasus split pusher lol  you can get away with bad mechanics in league way more than valorant
[1:08:48] teddybudd46: Shruge
[1:08:52] XagonogaX: that's just the diff nature of the two games. You can't win in an active game like valo or shooters in general without being somewhat mechanically good
[1:08:54] aotdstix: yeah i guess i undermined it
[1:09:07] onionjuicer: ya aim matter more in val than mechanics do in league
[1:09:54] N7evenn: true put Danny in any pro team he'll  get 10 kills min
[1:09:54] teddybudd46: pepeLost
[1:10:07] combowombowombo: so danny is just saying he wants to play premier
[1:10:07] Saizels: @N7evenn AINTNOWAY
[1:10:11] combowombowombo: is what im hearing
[1:10:25] teddybudd46: now now let's not get ahead of ourselves @n7evenn
[1:10:53] N7evenn: Danny can bag 10 kills against Fnatic homies
[1:11:03] combowombowombo: ehhh
[1:11:17] combowombowombo: he just went 1/7 against wedid
[1:11:18] teddybudd46: uh huh
[1:11:32] avonx: why isn't gekko holding bomb
[1:11:32] aotdstix: i wish danny was in a showmatch in some sorts with pros
[1:11:35] XagonogaX: It's kind of why i was so high on OW because it was a physical/frenetic game with mechanic checks (not as intense as valo), but still heavy on strategy like league
[1:11:36] booitsflex: yo wyd
[1:11:37] combowombowombo: he was
[1:11:37] N7evenn: Nah my daddy Danny weren't trying.
