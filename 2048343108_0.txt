[1:59:51] perfectsweeties: so many phds come out and struggle to find 50k post-doc jobs
[1:59:56] sirzarcon: It all depends on what the PhD is in
[2:00:11] Fengojo: LMAO i hope so bro
[2:00:35] Fengojo: it depends on the field u do ur PhD in lol
[2:01:19] perfectsweeties: yea but professor jobs are really difficult to get. most phds are subsidized so you dont have debt from them
[2:01:31] perfectsweeties: any stem phd at least you're getting "paid"
[2:01:32] mastertierlol: @perfectsweeties not even close to most
[2:01:52] Fengojo: almost all PhD programs in the US are funded/subsidized
[2:02:12] mastertierlol: @Fengojo The debt free part G
[2:02:49] Fengojo: yeah, u even make a bit of income (not that much of course)
[2:02:53] perfectsweeties: you usually make like 35k/year as a phd student
[2:03:08] Fengojo: depends on the program and school, but yeah most ppl can't handle a PhD program or research lol

[2:05:45] EatMeButt: its called hard work and dedication
[2:06:58] Fengojo: yeah most fields other than CS, only path is academia/professorship
[2:07:21] Fengojo: for CS now, a lot of folks go to google/openai/amazon/microsoft after, or do their own AI startup
[2:08:15] mastertierlol: You need a PhD in history to be a fully tenured professor
[2:08:30] perfectsweeties: you have to be really into the subject to get a phd. i dont think it's usually worth it from an income perspective
[2:08:48] perfectsweeties: you miss out on like 5-7 years of income in your field was well as that experience
[2:08:53] Fengojo: yeah most ppl do it cause of passion
[2:08:56] Fengojo: WAIT IS IT STYLISH LOL

[3:20:38] ChampionshipLeBlanc: the cooldown is on the aoe reveal but it always reveals the primary target and on that target it has no cd
[3:20:39] mastertierlol: @brandonchen135 didn't they take away item damage stats
[3:20:45] ChampionshipLeBlanc: it last for 6sec but no cd

[3:33:02] WwRoberxW: they need to change her w to teleport her like kata instead of dashing
[3:33:09] clinomaniacz: or when you die you continue to live on as the clone
[3:33:45] westleyyx: did u like when the old lb use to activate the mark again of any spell?
[3:34:06] batmanflyer: It is kinda funny the Shiv build got LB 3 most banned in lck spring 2023.
[3:36:17] virgin0il: the most reasonable buff on leblanc would be being able to choose on R spell like reworked lb.
