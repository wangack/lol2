[0:46:51] Drakam22: yes
[0:46:53] Mordis123: probably
[0:46:56] fatnaldini: alott of authors are dickheads

[0:47:12] Xey2510: he is Madge that the damn video games are successful
[0:47:13] fatnaldini: is he wrong'
[0:47:14] DonRamonBlanco: i mean, he kinda right
[0:47:14] Mordis123: hes right
[0:47:14] Afrobot: CAUGHT ay
[0:47:16] EgyptianOverlord: he's right, that isn't a crime
[0:47:16] Aeizalt: he's not wrong Pepelaugh
[0:47:17] Moadouu: he aint wrong tyh9o
[0:47:19] franross_: I think there was some drama around his royalties?
[0:47:20] kingrichardddddd: not wrong
[0:47:21] bawpbawp: he said that like 15 years ago tho?
[0:47:22] bawpbawp: right?
[0:47:22] Moadouu: he's not wrong if you think about it
[0:47:22] Philiqq: he was mad about the game being popular i think
[0:47:23] Redfactor3: no lies detected
[0:47:24] a_baby_worm: @Drakam22 but he wrote a book...............for gamers.......................?
[0:47:26] Swixtop: Cluegi

[0:47:37] SirMctrolington: @a_baby_worm I mean not really
[0:47:38] Aeizalt: @awakenwithin KEKW lmfao
[0:47:41] drbck: its a fantasy not game book
[0:47:42] Mordis123: scale vs vlad Clueless
[0:47:44] zafironius: @Pobelter HE ALSO ACCEPTED FLAT CASH LIKE 10k OR 20k I THINK INSTEAD OF ROYALTIES OR % INCOME FOR WITCHER GAMES SO IS SALTY
[0:47:50] Redfactor3: scale vs vlad?
[0:47:51] a_baby_worm: isn't the witcher a game first though
[0:47:52] EgyptianOverlord: @Drakam22 what makes you think his books are for gamers. it's just a fantasy series
[0:48:02] a_baby_worm: who else would read it but ppl who played the games
[0:48:03] SirMctrolington: @a_baby_worm No
[0:48:08] a_baby_worm: oh
[0:48:14] lolmshl: just reptile brain it
[0:48:17] a_baby_worm: ok nvm what i said then
[0:48:20] Mordis123: witcher books were written long before
[0:48:23] Arrexios: @Pobelter He gave the licence for for the games to be made, he agreed on a sum and after the games blew up he got really greedy and wanted more and more as far as I can remember
[0:48:25] marrentv: who scales harder? Jacye, or Vlad?
[0:48:27] Ezuri5: get a grip on yourself eugene and stop hitting him
[0:48:27] zafironius: @a_baby_worm i mean people who read fantasy its a great book series overall
[0:48:39] Drakam22: @EgyptianOverlord nothing makes me think that, he was asked about witcher games in an interview and he said 'games are for morons'
[0:48:55] a_baby_worm: fair ig im a gamer first and a reader second
[0:49:08] SirMctrolington: @a_baby_worm Witcher author right again
[0:49:10] Mordis123: hes an old polish man so it makes sense he doesnt like games I guess
[0:49:12] a_baby_worm: LOL
[0:49:18] aaron8that: cool shirt amigo
[0:49:19] DonRamonBlanco: xd
[0:49:22] Kithlan: @Arrexios Asked for a lump sum, classic ICANT
[0:49:23] Balldropper: oh..
[0:49:26] Moadouu: WHAT
[0:49:31] Redfactor3: invading rengar jg....
[0:49:31] Mordis123: this isnt playing safe
[0:49:33] Balldropper: i thought we wer eplaying safe and scaling
[0:49:36] Bucho_Burns: how is that playing sayfe !?
[0:49:43] Kelbotay: o7
[0:49:45] Ezuri5: my bad Tomfoolery
[0:49:45] Moadouu: cant fault you for wanting to rotate like that
[0:49:48] Moadouu: GIGACAUGHT
[0:49:49] Redfactor3: 2 kill rengar
[0:49:49] PavelNaNetu: Jebaited
[0:49:51] PavelNaNetu: byl clown
[0:49:52] zafironius: @a_baby_worm reading is generally way easier to have more and fuller content every time the manga/manhwa/books have alot more details and plot than any tv shows movies or games
[0:49:54] mooete: play safe :)
[0:49:55] curlythepube: GIGACAUGHT
[0:50:05] EgyptianOverlord: i kinda get why he hates the games, it butchers his story a good deal
[0:50:14] Mordis123: yeah they are different
[0:50:18] Moadouu: lule
[0:50:19] PavelNaNetu: -1
[0:50:27] Sampthson: winning trade, but at what cost :(
[0:50:34] fatnaldini: @zafironius characters usually more indepth too
[0:50:36] curlythepube: -1
[0:50:39] a_baby_worm: @zafironius i dont agree w this necessary, i think some stories can be told more effectively in diff medium...! i just didn't know the witcher was a book series first, ive never played it
[0:50:46] TheFoxSorcerer: and supporyt
[0:50:49] zafironius: @EgyptianOverlord he doesnt hate them for that he just haates them cause he hates games and ESPECIALLY the witcher games cause he thought they wouldnt make money so he took lump sum
[0:50:50] TheFoxSorcerer: support*
[0:50:51] Kithlan: I mean, don't the games establish that they're not an adaptation of the books?
[0:50:52] im_limit_test: ok
[0:51:03] SundreTV: essaying
[0:51:07] Redfactor3: @EgyptianOverlord i mean if you take it as transformative instead of trying to perfectly mirror, it is a fine variation on the original work. Also some of the original characters were unnecessarily 1 dimensiona
[0:51:08] EgyptianOverlord: @EgyptianOverlord oh ok so he's just a bitter old man
[0:51:11] SirMctrolington: Chatting
[0:51:32] a_baby_worm: first time i met gerard was in monster hunter world :B
[0:51:35] GreaT_Tat: @pobelter why no tear
[0:51:47] Redfactor3: @GreaT_Tat tear no giv beg dmg
[0:52:07] Redfactor3: no way rengar team loses from here Clueless
[0:52:08] zafironius: @a_baby_worm SOME stories can be told way better yes but realistically you can either write and publish a book series of like 10 books yourself for 40-70k OR spend like 400 milion dollars for the abridged version in a tv/movie
[0:52:13] Aeizalt: @EgyptianOverlord wait, how much did he get???
[0:52:38] Moadouu: cannot have anything for free these days
[0:52:43] Aeizalt: urgotta be kidding me :tf:
[0:52:48] Redfactor3: urGOT to be kidding me
[0:52:52] Kithlan: Don't think that knowledge is public @Aeizalt
[0:52:55] zafironius: @Aeizalt i think it was 10 or 20k which to be fair IS ALOT if you dont think the games will pop off the deal was made in like 2006 or smth when games didnt actually make money
[0:52:57] Redfactor3: @Aeizalt dang it
[0:53:02] curlythepube: Nerdge chat did you know bees ALWAYS know what time it is, even if they are deep underground? and also did you know bees wont fly in the dark?
[0:53:04] onemodog: this jayce guy kind of hot
[0:53:16] Aeizalt: wow, imagine taking a lump sum for witcher game royalties OMEGALUL
[0:53:17] Redfactor3: @curlythepube peepoSit
[0:53:23] im_limit_test: what are we yapping about i got answert to questions
[0:53:33] Mordis123: he still makes a ton of money from the books so its not like hes poor
[0:53:34] Kithlan: @zafironius Also, especially since the first one was kinda niche. Didn't blow up until W2
[0:53:35] a_baby_worm: @zafironius i mean, yeah............ isnt rly the point of anything i said though ^^; idk i like to read manga and like to play games and sometimes read books. and i like to get diff stories from diff mediums
[0:53:41] curlythepube: peepoSit
[0:54:15] Aeizalt: @Aeizalt wow, that's nothing compared to what he could have gotten though... he must be cheesed af
[0:54:36] jawsh042: hi pobelter I like your shirt :)
[0:54:36] zafironius: @a_baby_worm i agree with you but the sad reality is hollywood is never going to risk NOT making 50x the invested money of something so they half ass everything and complain they dont make money
[0:54:48] Redfactor3: @im_limit_test popCat
[0:54:48] Aeizalt: playing safe is my favourite strategy <3
[0:54:50] zafironius: example the wheel of time series
[0:55:02] salkoamok: salkoamok subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! much love

[0:56:17] confusingturtle: how are the games today pob?
[0:56:24] Kithlan: @zafironius Those weren't half-assed though, the screenwriters just don't respect the work. Netflix threw money at the Witcher, and Amazon at WoT, but the writers fucked it all up by making terrible changes instead of a straight adaptation
[0:56:30] Balldropper: o that guys name is yangus beef
[0:56:32] Redfactor3: noooo way rengar team losing after early game Goobert

[0:59:22] zafironius: @blastboys123 i mean one of the so called "nerdbitches" was the main cast actor that made the show what it is
[0:59:32] Redfactor3: stop feeding the troll guys
[0:59:38] Mordis123: has to be trolling

[1:01:03] friend101: Rengar damage SeemsGood

[1:01:15] blastboys123: but whois the real idiots
[1:01:15] a_baby_worm: didn't regnar just get nerfed
[1:01:22] DonRamonBlanco: i wish jayce had a toy hammer and it made the squaky noise when he lands the q
[1:01:22] Mordis123: hubris is balanced I think
[1:01:31] blastboys123: They hated him because he spoke the truth
[1:01:38] blastboys123: thats a quote from something iread form reddit

[1:01:52] Kithlan: How long do you think until the game's less one-shotty? Want to jump back in, but this meta feels like a recipe for inting
[1:01:58] zafironius: @blastboys123 bro you fumbled and made the bait too obvious
[1:02:00] Bucho_Burns: funs over, rengar is home
[1:02:07] chaddyjeffy: all for it to be tank meta again by june @Aeizalt
[1:02:09] Redfactor3: baited by 10% jungle car

[1:03:49] Moadouu: rengar can one shot anybody you're not special Kappa
[1:03:52] chaddyjeffy: scrubnoob out here so happy

[1:57:57] Redfactor3: @AlecoGereco I mean the bare minimum of it, normally there are way more advanced macro concepts in high level league. Where you make multiple planned macro decisions, rather than being just reactionary to current game, but rather having a plan given team comps, as well as expectations on how lanes are supposed to go. However, those concepts are low value to learn for most of solo queue since the stuff that happens is pretty random most of the time, people just flip stuff

[9:55:35] vitusalinas: @Kithlan tbf is better if Hwei is weak, imagine how RIOT would it be if he was OP
[9:55:37] Rivaledd: when pilot isn’t dog

[9:56:08] mcegginton: @pwnkat His skill floor isn't as high as people think
[9:56:10] pwnkat: it's orderly yk? dmg abiltiies, cc, and utility + AoE ult.
[9:56:16] digitalli: RIOT
[9:56:17] TorqueBandit: Hwei is the most difficult champ in the game, he has multiple abilities
[9:56:18] Smoot1e: pwnkat grubby tried him out and didn't do horribly
[9:56:19] Tewma2: The all chat LUL
[9:56:21] laurik: LUL
[9:56:25] iksir8: that baby jump
[9:56:26] zazealot777: winnable
[9:56:27] maxmusterm4nn: @pwnkat  because they wanted to create a iconic champ too but it's hard to balance it with 10 spells
[9:56:31] jcvargas44: that was a tiny jump lol
[9:56:32] pwnkat: pob is actually using hwei pretty cool i like his waveclear method
[9:56:32] digitalli: RIOT 🆚 RIOT
[9:56:34] jordanmon18: @vitusalinas people complained and riot said maybe some champs aren't meant to carry
[9:56:37] zazealot777: ferari tf LUL

[9:57:31] pwnkat: but complaining about a skill floor is like complaining about how poorly the average mind will perform on him..
[9:57:36] vitusalinas: @jordanmon18 I mean, thats fair no? not every champ is designed to be a carry. Maybe they can buff Hwei´s support aspect?
