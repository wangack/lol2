[0:20:03] PoorMansPoison: they are literally hamburger steaks so yeah
[0:20:10] thatluckyloser: ground beef and steak seem different. I assume it is not made from ground beef and is just a cut of meat like skirt stake

[0:25:32] thatluckyloser: COPIUM
[0:25:32] MaliceHobbit: Sounds like something a furry would say
[0:25:33] isyourTVrunning: What compulsive said

[0:40:08] knight_thyme: peepoArrive
[0:40:09] HappyDwagon: CANNON
[0:40:10] Darchon_: some cannons just don't have money Shruge
[0:40:53] hybridsnake: they spent all the money they had on those cannons Sadge
[0:41:10] MCManon: FYI If you have mood swing, like being very happy, and then very angry, and five minutes later, swing back to overwhelming happiness it is being "bordeline" and not bipolar (I know because I am bordeline, and also I agree with Lawlman, he wasn't make fun of mental illness)
[0:41:41] BuckerT88: @MCManon I thought it was called being my GF....
[0:42:00] Broke99: @BuckerT88 Boomer ass ex wife joke lmao
[0:42:09] thatluckyloser: I was gonna say Broke is right
[0:42:14] BuckerT88: @Broke99 I'm old and I know what I like.
[0:42:14] TyrannessBelial: Borderlien is "fixable"
[0:42:15] DraygoDraygon: Borderline Personality Disorder
[0:42:19] TyrannessBelial: you can take DBT
[0:42:23] Brightbane: Borderline personality disorder
[0:42:32] DraygoDraygon: Its MORE treatable than Bipolar
[0:42:38] DraygoDraygon: But not fixable
[0:42:40] meatballwalkin: bipolar also has a few types but it usually takes the form of long-term mania and long-term depression
[0:42:48] DraygoDraygon: Bipolar is MORE severe than borderline
[0:42:50] bearonvonbear: Shruge
[0:42:50] omgwhatlolz: has to do with duration. bipolar had manic episodes that last a long time
[0:42:56] PoeticTromboneWaifu: borderline personality disorder. It's a trauma disorder that makes people be really inconsistent with the people around them.
[0:43:01] thatluckyloser: I think its a scale thing
[0:43:14] DraygoDraygon: Scale, length of time, reason it occurs, and triggers
[0:43:14] MCManon: no, bordeline means you go from one extreme to the other (from one border to the other) in a short periode of time
[0:43:20] Broke99: I know absolutely nothing of this subject
[0:43:42] thatluckyloser: nice
[0:43:42] Moobot: Pythe has been authorized to set phasers to kill.
[0:43:47] MCManon: bipolar, you are in a depress or maniac periode for a longer periode of time, like weeks, months
[0:43:56] meatballwalkin: yeah kinda
[0:43:59] TyrannessBelial: right, for some cases, therapists prefer to get you diagnoses with PTSD over BPD.
[0:44:05] meatballwalkin: every case is very different
[0:44:05] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[0:44:06] TyrannessBelial: why is ptsd an emote...
[0:44:15] Broke99: PTSD
[0:44:15] DraygoDraygon: Different criteria
[0:44:20] Brightbane: Bipolar is treated with meds, borderline is treated with behavioral therapy
[0:44:22] DraygoDraygon: Cause, symptoms
[0:44:23] MCManon: no medication for bordeline, while there is for bipolar
[0:44:31] DraygoDraygon: And yeah that
[0:44:34] thatluckyloser: @TyrannessBelial we play a lot of Arma here
[0:44:36] TyrannessBelial: yeah Borderline is purely therapy and counselling
[0:44:46] PoeticTromboneWaifu: Bipolar is actually two disorders. BP-1 and BP-2. But is categorized when mania occurs, and mania creates recognizable, and diagnosable behaviour. Like religious delusions
[0:44:48] meatballwalkin: the DSM usually defines disorders as "you meet X amount of criteria on this checklist" but everyone can be different
[0:44:49] thatluckyloser: in vietnam specifically
[0:44:53] TyrannessBelial: Problem is DBT therapy is very intensive.
[0:44:56] TyrannessBelial: and expensive
[0:45:11] Tasaab: suboptimal AAAA
[0:45:19] TyrannessBelial: no boots lmao
[0:45:20] DraygoDraygon: Every mental health thing here is too expensive
[0:45:21] thatluckyloser: What did they think Joan of Arc had?
[0:45:22] theowin333: Azir kinda strutting in beat to music
[0:45:31] theowin333: donkWalk
[0:45:35] DraygoDraygon: thatluckyloser Bunch of possibilities, no real way to know
[0:45:41] thatluckyloser: Oh for sure
[0:45:47] meatballwalkin: @thatluckyloser it's a slippery slope to project modern diagnoses on historical figures
[0:45:52] DraygoDraygon: She fits some things in a bunch of different disorders
[0:45:54] DraygoDraygon: And yeah that
[0:45:55] pythe_was_here: @thatluckyloser they think she had schizophrenia these days, or at least that was the most recent thing i saw
[0:46:02] thatluckyloser: Thats a good point Meat
[0:46:06] bearonvonbear: Dance
[0:46:12] NPSJason: think of how hard it is to fix the world's most complex computer. now think of how far even the most complex computer is from what a brain can do, and imagine trying to fix problems with that, except you're not able to pull a working one apart to take a look
[0:46:20] Broke99: @pythe_was_here She falls in line with it based off accounts thats for sure
[0:46:22] DraygoDraygon: Impossible to know since. Well, a lot of reasons
[0:46:23] NPSJason: that's what people trying to work in mental health are doing
[0:46:26] Broke99: although I'd say her uhh
[0:46:28] Broke99: commanding officer
[0:46:29] Broke99: was a lot worse
[0:46:31] arrowdeath4: so how many times does bossman need to tilt before these streams become a net negative?
[0:46:34] NPSJason: so the answer always has a dose of 'it's complicated chief'
[0:46:39] Mag_Lev: The human brain is a wild thing.
[0:46:46] MCManon: @TyrannessBelial Lucky me, in canada, since I have a diagnostic with a psychiatrist, I've got access to frees psy services
[0:46:49] thatluckyloser: yeah mental health requires a lot of nuance
[0:47:02] thatluckyloser: Nerdge
[0:47:02] DraygoDraygon: MCManon Functional health care, what a dream
[0:47:09] HuxyFluxy: Nerdge AKSHUALLY
[0:47:10] Mag_Lev: It is a bowl of electrified tapioca but still runs one of the most complex things we've even seen.
[0:47:21] DraygoDraygon: We KNOW how those work though
[0:47:28] marshypou: @Broke99 bitch
[0:47:30] DraygoDraygon: We DONT know how brain works
[0:47:36] meatballwalkin: even supercomputers can only follow commands
[0:47:50] DraygoDraygon: Brain meat hard
[0:47:52] DraygoDraygon: Despite being soft
[0:48:02] thatluckyloser: I mean brains also follow commands based on DNA and RNA and external stimuli right?
[0:48:06] Darchon_: quick, say worth
[0:48:07] BuckerT88: I'd argue awful analogy as computers are super easy to diagnose and fix.
[0:48:19] DraygoDraygon: Brains follow a lot of shit, they got all kinds of connections
[0:48:21] Broke99: @marshypou bitch ass
[0:48:21] PoeticTromboneWaifu: @DraygoDraygon I mean, we understand somethings. But it's not like the brain is completely opaque to us. We know how a lot of systems work. Like visual systems, and the endocrine systems
[0:48:23] Broke99: bitch
[0:48:26] marshypou: ass
[0:48:27] TyrannessBelial: lawlman... boots...
[0:48:29] marshypou: dutch
[0:48:42] isyourTVrunning: As Wehner Von Braun once said "The best computer is a man, and it's the only one that can be produced by unskilled labor"
[0:48:45] thatluckyloser: Yeah, Brains as a computer is a good analogy before it becomes bad
[0:48:47] DraygoDraygon: PoeticTromboneWaifu We understand the BASICS in a lot of things yeah, or the theoretical mechanisms/physical connections
[0:48:49] meatballwalkin: @thatluckyloser i mean yeah. you can argue that we never make decisions at all, and everything we do is based on external stimuli. but i think there's an effective difference that we can all see
[0:48:50] BuckerT88: We didn't create our brains, YET*
[0:48:54] ToutedDjinn: Shruge who really needs boots
[0:49:00] GhostofWar55: still say the brain is the most complex computer simply because its ever evolving and learning or losing
[0:49:02] Hobo1001: chat boots are for losers
[0:49:04] Hobo1001: Smadge
[0:49:18] Hobo1001: if he buys boots then he has to buy 20 for all his soldiers
[0:49:18] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[0:49:26] Hobo1001: it isnt fair for just 1 to get them
[0:49:30] HuxyFluxy: graves syndrome
[0:49:31] Broke99: Chat I'm gonna say somethin mean
[0:49:33] DraygoDraygon: Hobo1001 They share
[0:49:33] Broke99: real mean
[0:49:34] GebisGaming: chat, let your grippers be free! don't confine your dogs to dark, moist caves
[0:49:38] Broke99: Yo mama
[0:49:39] thatluckyloser: @thatluckyloser Oh I wouldn't say that, but I would say that the gray matter does function based off some sort of complex logic
[0:49:42] marshypou: ketchup aint a real sauce
[0:49:44] jaxkmurphy: @lawlman what’s your opinion on boots in league ? they removed them from smite a few seasons ago and it just made the game better
[0:49:47] arrowdeath4: guys, classical computers and brains are very, very different architecturally, you're comparing a central processor with RAM against a distributed network with billions of cells
[0:49:48] Melamamoduro: It can now it seems
[0:49:48] Hobo1001: yeah it grabs you with its tiny hands
[0:49:49] NPSJason: yeah the brain is like we are trying to figure out the most alien tech shit ever with no interface, and if you break it you go to jail
[0:49:50] Hobo1001: and rips you in
[0:49:51] Mag_Lev: You can turn off a computer and fix it, you can't turn off a brain and fix it without risk.
[0:49:51] CompulsiveOne: baron got those hands
[0:49:57] Melamamoduro: @Hobo1001 It has hands?
[0:49:59] Broke99: @marshypou holy shit so fuckin true
[0:50:21] pythe_was_here: @marshypou explain this to me
[0:50:29] Korgon297: EZ Clap
[0:50:29] meatballwalkin: @thatluckyloser i don't disagree! we can get real into it if we want, but for the purposes of mental illness my point is that the way computers and brains work is too different to compare
[0:50:31] CompulsiveOne: that was a cool fight
[0:50:32] Darchon_: probably has boots PepeLaugh
[0:50:35] marshypou: i pass it to broke @Broke99
[0:50:35] BuckerT88: @Mag_Lev Thats just because we haven't created the tools yet to backup the RAM of a brain.
[0:50:39] marshypou: take it from here
[0:50:39] DraygoDraygon: Ketchup is a fruit
[0:50:56] Hobo1001: thats Zeri lawlman
[0:51:03] arrowdeath4: ketchup is fruit 'juice,' prove me wrong
[0:51:08] Faleebo: you win these
[0:51:10] CompulsiveOne: yeah and no one plays zeri OMEGALUL
[0:51:11] bigults_tv: Just remove items theyre uneeded bloat
[0:51:14] Hobo1001: Zeri is the skill Auto attack champ
[0:51:16] thatluckyloser: @thatluckyloser Oh yes I definitely agree that this comparison is good for maybe like trying to understand new ways of organizing and manipulating information but definitely not that of human experience
[0:51:21] Don_Savik: smite already gives you more control of your character, you dont need extra speed
[0:51:23] GebisGaming: @arrowdeath4 it's too viscous to be a juice. wtf are you saying
[0:51:24] HuxyFluxy: its fun when you have a 600 ms hecarim running towards you Aware
[0:51:25] Broke99: @pythe_was_here According to the national hotdog and sausage association if you are above the age of 18 you shouldn't be using ketchup on a hot dog as it is sugar syrup tomate paste and not a good condiment
[0:51:25] Faleebo: I play adc smite
[0:51:28] Faleebo: I love that
[0:51:28] TheMadBadger: Well SMITE your boots get build into your movespeed tbf.
[0:51:37] jaxkmurphy: @lawlman oh I don’t mean removing movement from items just boots as an item like you get it in other ways instead of being forced to always build boots
[0:51:37] Hobo1001: SHE IS ALSO FAST AS FUCK
[0:51:43] Hobo1001: and a pain in the ass to play and fight
[0:51:44] NPSJason: @Lawlman speaking of smite we gonna see you and Sam on that smite 2 train when it drops?
[0:51:44] Hobo1001: LuL
[0:51:47] pythe_was_here: wait theres AN AGE LIMIT on ketchup????
[0:51:48] Faleebo: @themadbadger boots have been out a long time stripSuffer
[0:51:49] DraygoDraygon: Yeah Smite just moved it to the characters themselves and other items
[0:51:53] PoorMansPoison: yeah movespeed is still in smite
[0:51:55] NPSJason: those streams were fun as hell
[0:51:56] PoorMansPoison: just not on boots
[0:51:58] marshypou: @pythe_was_here yes so
[0:51:58] GebisGaming: @Broke99 imagine policing how people eat their food OMEGALUL
[0:51:59] Broke99: @pythe_was_here Yes

[0:52:08] pythe_was_here: no :)
[0:52:16] Broke99: Grow up
[0:52:20] Hobo1001: @Broke99 they can go fuckthemself with their fake ass taco looking sandwich
[0:52:22] Don_Savik: I like picking out what boots I wanna wear peepoShy
[0:52:22] thatluckyloser: we big brain today
[0:52:25] marshypou: it aint dropped in dirt
[0:52:25] jaxkmurphy: that’s fair
[0:52:28] DraygoDraygon: Should make a boot slot
[0:52:42] meatballwalkin: but cassio passive /s
[0:52:48] Hobo1001: LET CASS HAVE BOOTS AGAIN Smadge
[0:52:49] GebisGaming: as a morde player, removing boots would make me cry
[0:52:50] Hobo1001: JUSTICE FOR SNAKE LADY
[0:52:51] DraygoDraygon: Cassio passive is great
[0:52:57] Faleebo: there’s no boots in smite mista lawlman
[0:53:00] PoorMansPoison: Cassio my beloved
[0:53:03] Broke99: NEW GAMBA
[0:53:07] Hobo1001: ITS BULL SHIT CASS CANT HAVE BOOTS Smadge
[0:53:09] arrowdeath4: chat, here me out: what if we just remove flash entirely
[0:53:14] arrowdeath4: like next patch: gone.
[0:53:18] bearonvonbear: Dance
[0:53:21] NPSJason: Cass should get half benefits from boots since she can only wear 1
[0:53:28] jaxkmurphy: the way smite did it was your movement speed increased by your level which I don’t think would work in league as it’s easier to create level gaps
[0:53:29] Don_Savik: my issue with Cass is that she is slower than basically every mid unless you land skillshots, which is not fun
[0:53:29] DraygoDraygon: arrowdeath4 Well then there's still a billion dash champions
[0:53:35] NPSJason: also why is Nami able to wear boots lawlmanWeird
[0:53:39] GebisGaming: remove ghost then
[0:53:39] BuckerT88: Removing boots disadvantages the immobile classes. Because in the land of slow ass champs, dashes are king.
[0:53:40] GebisGaming: buffpupSip
[0:53:42] Broke99: @NPSJason Flippers
[0:53:43] Hobo1001: flash is a skill expression NODDERS
[0:53:45] jaxkmurphy: isn’t league built around flash at its core ?
[0:53:48] CompulsiveOne: this game would suck without flash
[0:53:51] DraygoDraygon: Basically
[0:53:52] ebinbean: make flash a 2k item that gives no stats
[0:53:55] marshypou: @NPSJason stompers
[0:53:55] HuxyFluxy: flash would make so many immobile champions so unplayable with all the dashes in the game now
[0:53:56] PoorMansPoison: Playing an auto attacker in smite feels so much better than auto attackers in league
[0:53:56] CompulsiveOne: holy fuck what a fucked up world
[0:54:01] jaxkmurphy: now keeping stopwatch gone is the right choice @lawlman
[0:54:10] PoeticTromboneWaifu: Get rid of flash and bring in blink dagger
[0:54:18] Hobo1001: Lawlman does flash go on f or d?

[0:56:35] Hobo1001: and make her nuke harder
[0:56:38] Hobo1001: and survive better
[0:56:40] arrowdeath4: you were so busy trying to figure out if you could that you didn't stop to think if you should

[3:40:09] TheGrayPlains: @Lawlman The word bazaar comes from Persian bāzār, from Middle Persian wāzār, from Old Persian vāčar, from Proto-Indo-Iranian *wahā-čarana12. The term spread from Persia into Arabia and ultimately throughout the Middle East1. The word bazaar means "market"23. The word bazaar may have been borrowed through French bazar3.

[5:15:06] Skoto: thats the only way to climb sometimes, abuse whats broken
[5:15:11] JamesXLR8: that was an old set name I think  and they brought it back Shruge
[5:15:42] omgwhatlolz: No S+ till you eat all your cannons
[5:16:03] FilthySerf: They really need to revitalize TFT. Its always the same characters and items, just some different synergies
[5:16:09] TheMadBadger: Fun fact, you can ban Smolder even tho he's not playable dazeLul
[5:16:20] HahaHazer: I forgot he was a thing
[5:16:22] TheMadBadger: Everyone wanted actual big dragon
[5:16:23] pandalisk9: the only ap champ allowed to be broken is seraphine Smadge
[5:16:23] Oglino: Shruge
[5:16:24] basstieon: joey wheeler is
[5:16:24] TyrannessBelial: it is
[5:16:25] Squabbers: Says the Big Minion guy. Looking

[5:16:30] Telethari: only dragon champ i'm hyped for is Shyvana VGU
[5:16:30] TyrannessBelial: originally it was gonna grow to an adult
[5:16:30] Coyote_MD: Too bad his designer was fired
[5:16:31] JoePatzilla: Well, what was your reception to star dragon?
[5:16:32] TyrannessBelial: but they gave up
[5:16:33] TheMadBadger: no-one wanted baby dragon
[5:16:34] ChibiYordle: I think he is cute
[5:16:34] Skoto: most of the last champs were weak af
[5:16:40] Eburi87: I'm hyped for Sylas to steal dragon baby ult and for his mom to show up

[5:16:50] gingaginge: spyro skylanders looking ass
[5:16:51] FilthySerf: Riot has really been bad with monster champion designs
[5:16:51] nordic_fatcheese: Deathwing from HotS
[5:16:54] JoePatzilla: They did give smoulder the sonic treatment already
[5:16:58] Grognog: Was one of the things they did SUPER well in HOTS
[5:17:04] Grognog: Deathwing was fucking awesome
[5:17:10] TheMadBadger: People were hoping Smolder would do that.
[5:17:11] Llwvyn: I still think it's funny that smolder's taunt is "my mom works at riot" but his creator got laid off
[5:17:12] spaghettiweaver: is smolder furry spyro
[5:17:12] Squabbers: Nerdge
[5:17:13] TyrannessBelial: @Lawlman That was the original idea, they gave up on it, too much model work.
[5:17:16] twyxtr: if asol grew galaxy size
[5:17:18] Colgaldy: Like Bel'Veth but cool?
[5:17:25] JoePatzilla: @Llwvyn Sadge

[5:17:45] TheMadBadger: Riot is fucking scarred from Lux Ultimate skin, holy hell
[5:17:46] pandalisk9: i dont know if i like the a'sol changes coming peepoSad
[5:17:46] TheGrayPlains: Need more Lux skins...
[5:17:47] OafALoaf: multi dollar company
[5:17:47] MadWikked: Too hard, Valve did it already lol
[5:17:53] UndeadImpulse: Would you count A Sol a dragon? At least in design
[5:17:58] ChibiYordle: Remember, it has been a full year since they announced the skarner rework as well
[5:18:00] Coyote_MD: I'm fine with Spyro for what he is
[5:18:00] HuxyFluxy: Corpa hold up let him speak
[5:18:19] Squabbers: Legends Of Runeterra gonna get fucked because of the layoffs. Sadge
[5:18:26] UndeadImpulse: Fair
[5:18:30] Telethari: only thing i like about smoulder is that it's an adc that calls their mom

[5:18:51] EvilEden: i relate to being able to breath fire and fly with my wings
[5:18:52] Grognog: Hopefully when shyvanna redesign goes through her dragon form is cool as hell
[5:18:56] ChibiYordle: I like Alexstraza in hots. She turns into a dragon. :3

[5:19:06] FeatherRun: Can't make 10000% profit on the dragon skins if it's more than one model
[5:19:08] Oglino: Ao Shin thats what it was
[5:19:11] HahaHazer: Nerds
[5:19:12] pandalisk9: my favorite thing is the champion designer for smolder being like " hey guys! i hope you love my champ - i got laid off" :)
[5:19:20] JoePatzilla: @ChibiYordle So shyv
[5:19:21] JamesXLR8: or a zombie dragon

[5:19:44] TheMadBadger: I'm just thankful that Jakiro is in DOTA 2. Love my Fire/Ice Dragon with two heads
[5:19:46] ChibiYordle: @JoePatzilla yes but in lore alextraza is reversed. A dragon that becomes human no? :3
[5:19:53] RankOneRoach: riot insists on putting spins on characters (the modern ones, at least)
[5:20:00] omgwhatlolz: just 3 dragon buds that each do a spell then ult all 3 do something
[5:20:01] JoePatzilla: @ChibiYordle ye
[5:20:21] basstieon: i mean baron as a champ would have the same problem but i mean the model work would be minimal just like dragon
[5:20:24] FilthySerf: all dragons
[5:20:26] JoePatzilla: They have magic to have visage forms
[5:20:27] omgwhatlolz: dragons in wow are shapechangers

[5:20:39] MadWikked: All dragons, begin chromie isn't an aspect
[5:20:42] MadWikked: because*
[5:20:48] JoePatzilla: all

[5:21:10] CompulsiveOne: LUL
[5:21:14] Colgaldy: You literally play an RTS
[5:21:17] Shmartee: become more meepo

[5:22:14] Grognog: With that and levels? God, fuck that
[5:22:20] nordic_fatcheese: HotS was way less structured, it was aram from minute one
[5:22:28] fluffypandaa214: that would be scary as fuck
[5:22:29] ChibiYordle: @Eburi87 Eeeebuuuwiii! Me bite. :3

[8:52:24] MadWikked: Does the 1 million work  the same as the lottery?
[8:52:25] Swimmingrock: 1 Mil, because that's way more than I'll make living in a 3rd world country.
[8:52:26] Gahnzo: Free income for sure.
[8:52:27] Aster_Op: 1 million right now in a 7% yield is way more

[8:52:45] KaiGoesMoo: 1 mil up front will outdo all my work pay like 2 times over
[8:52:50] Joeltech: Can I get another job?
[8:52:51] Mag_Lev: If you make big purchases just cause you've got 1mil you are wasting money Madge
[8:52:54] Pr4ise_: Never have to be laid off, always have guaranteed money

[8:53:32] Godsdices1: I think 1 mil as long as i still have my current job, it would just be nice to have the peace of mind of it
[8:53:35] GebisGaming: @KaiGoesMoo not if you're the right kind of person :)
[8:53:47] KaiGoesMoo: @GebisGaming I am not that kind of person Sadge

[8:54:17] Salty_Platypus: is streamer white collar or blue collar?
[8:54:21] Oglino: definitely couldn't make more than 1 mil in my life time tbh
[8:54:32] Tolkien504: 1 mil is so much fucking money, if you saved literally all of your money making 100k a year for a decade, you'd get a million. I've never made close to 50k, it's the million for sure imo
[8:54:33] Oglino: HUHH the fuck

[8:56:12] Salty_Platypus: workplace injury payout
[8:56:13] KaiGoesMoo: They shoot you if you get another job
[8:56:14] TheGrayPlains: then my current 100%
[8:56:14] Shmartee: oh gross
[8:56:23] Pr4ise_: before or after taxes?
[8:56:31] Shmartee: wait, so you can work if you take the 1 mil but not with the passive income?
[8:56:34] Pr4ise_: because my income untaxed 100%
[8:56:35] Salty_Platypus: a million isn't what it used to be
