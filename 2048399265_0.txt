[1:29:35] deadlyvirus0006: 7th round pick are fightin for a Prac squad spot, and he is leadng his team to back to back nfc games and now a superbowl apperance pretty crazy
[1:29:48] PloutoWD: what is your opinion about AP shaco ?
[1:30:45] deadlyvirus0006: you have to admit he gets more hate than most of all the 1st rounds bust qbs last 3 years
[1:30:46] ptar: Explain in League terms pls
[1:31:15] deadlyvirus0006: Jimmy G is benched in LA now
[1:31:53] izkappaross: be real, you never know about any position. Trying to guess who is going to be great and a HOF is just that, a guess. There was a YouTube video I can link that discussed draft position and their career outcome. Public opinion is just generally trash around football where a lot of people just parrot what the popular people are saying.
[1:32:12] izkappaross: totally agree that purdy is a system qb, look at him with and without deebo
[1:32:43] izkappaross: izkappaross subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[1:33:06] deadlyvirus0006: the narrative that he is only good cause his surronding cast is funny, alot of HOF all have had good supporting cast.. Look at aikman,emmitt smith, Micheal Irvin top 3 O Line at  the time..they had 6HOF on that team when they all played
[1:33:47] sickboyclique: clean backflip bro
[1:33:53] deadlyvirus0006: you legit said that first thing lol you said look at best wr and best rb
[1:34:12] deadlyvirus0006: i agree with what yoru saying now
[1:34:26] izkappaross: Another way to look at what Chase is saying is that the amount of success he is finding now wouldnt be present without his supreme cast.
[1:34:48] izkappaross: he is a good QB, but is up lifted by his system and team
[1:34:57] MrPepperJams: monkaHmm i got a twitch dm from some scam company in a diff language and they forgot to give me a link or tell me where to get scammed
[1:34:59] deadlyvirus0006: @izkappaross you can say that about all the top teams now lol
[1:35:11] TheCrispyDanish: its like playing jungle with 3 winning lanes who setup ganks and executes dives well
[1:35:15] deadlyvirus0006: i mean the weather was complete shit night aswell
[1:35:27] deadlyvirus0006: well that is dumb cause no1 is on taht lvl
[1:35:29] deadlyvirus0006: and never will
[1:35:34] TheCrispyDanish: no you cant
[1:35:37] deadlyvirus0006: Pat has HOF KElce
[1:35:43] izkappaross: @deadlyvirus0006 I disagree whole heartedly.
[1:35:59] deadlyvirus0006: Most cathes and yards in playoffs in history of nfl ol
[1:36:06] izkappaross: I would type, but would just be reiterating what Chase is saying.
[1:36:20] deadlyvirus0006: no1 is on pat lvls we can agrre on that
[1:36:33] deadlyvirus0006: hes he has nother 10yrs
[1:36:38] deadlyvirus0006: hes only 28
[1:36:56] izkappaross: KC native so agree to disagree about the last point on Mahomes and his likability, but thats a whole new conversation not relevant to stats.
[1:36:57] deadlyvirus0006: Game changer/game manager i get that
[1:37:34] TheCrispyDanish: Allen on the Bills is beautiful to watch
[1:37:38] deadlyvirus0006: but purdy is a high end Game Manager, and does best at what he is asked of
[1:37:39] izkappaross: cool cool, so we all in agreement lol?
[1:37:48] pirelli_p_zer0: Singed is so good now i love that champ as well

[1:39:13] deadlyvirus0006: who is your nfl team?
[1:39:19] TheCrispyDanish: i tune in to listen football on god, thats why i brought it up

[1:42:37] TheCrispyDanish: The Cowboys can't just tear it all down. But idk what you fix
[1:43:07] deadlyvirus0006: So i think the cowboys wont win it all wth dak but you wont find a better qb either imo
[1:43:10] SailorPluto9: If I was rich enough, id buy the Cowboys and move them to like Oklahoma for the lulz
[1:43:13] izkappaross: Your defense was so inconsistent all season
[1:43:15] TheCrispyDanish: Ravens defense is what you wanted on the cowboys

[1:43:28] izkappaross: people just finally started to pay attention when the offense couldnt overcome
[1:43:29] deadlyvirus0006: @izkappaross well cant stop the run with 195lb line backers
[1:43:59] mohdossaily: In American football who is the GOAT 🐐
[1:44:14] deadlyvirus0006: 9ers are having a hard time stopping the run atm the outside runs
[1:44:20] mohdossaily: Like misse in soccer
[1:45:03] TheCrispyDanish: 48 pts and starting 0-27 in that game. Bruh hire a new defensive coach or just fking fire all ur defensive players
[1:45:16] deadlyvirus0006: call me crazy but id rather the 9ers face pat over Ravens cause ravens shit all over my 9ers and purdy threw 4ints
[1:45:56] izkappaross: I think that saying pat mahomes needs the same amount of rings (which you didn't say) is crazy. I think we need to account for the defense status throughout their respective play times.
[1:46:02] false_monk: scene my friend
[1:46:28] izkappaross: winning this year, with the amount of trips they have and level of contention puts him in a very reasonable discussion
[1:46:39] Uwanted: what u guy are talking about?
[1:46:39] deadlyvirus0006: @izkappaross brady played in the weakest Division, was auto to the playoffs each year lol
[1:46:41] TheCrispyDanish: @izkappaross most people just compare resumes and end the convo lol
[1:47:22] izkappaross: totally fair on both accounts, I think he is a GREAT player, and an argument can be made about him being the best.
[1:47:41] TheCrispyDanish: double ignite lol
[1:47:47] izkappaross: I think a measure of his greatness is the fact that he was able to capitalize on those pieces tho.
[1:48:07] deadlyvirus0006: @izkappaross brady also took huge pay cuts to make his team great around him
[1:48:42] izkappaross: absolutely, like i said tho, his ex wife put him in that position and he was able to capitalize for the betterment of his team
[1:48:54] izkappaross: the narrative is always deeper than what people allow to be considered
[1:49:05] TheCrispyDanish: why is he waiting to pillar hello?
[1:49:05] Nightbot: because

[4:17:16] dhlmgmt: Kappa
[4:17:24] TheeFatYak: @what_head 100% not a pit bull and nothing like that breed at all
[4:17:24] jaizer91: The main thing would be to rescue them vs buying from a breeder if possible in that scenario
[4:17:25] OceanBuffalo: except chihuahuas, always suck
[4:17:59] chainerman: or stealing them
[4:18:08] BastigLD6: Rotties are super prone to disease. Pitties were literally bred for aggressive traits though
[4:18:41] chainerman: no my only point with breed specific, is there are levels of effort required for training and such
[4:18:52] TheeFatYak: Chase spitting facts
[4:19:05] what_head: @TheeFatYak yeah ik the actually pitbulls are built like a wall staffs are just stocky
