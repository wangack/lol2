I would love to tell him every night “I love you” and rub his feet while he streams. We would go out when he isn’t doing gamer stuff and have fun together. He is also great at gaming so I would be able to get carried by my very own BF. I love boys who are better at things than me so I can learn from them. God I want to date him.
