[0:49:07] FeomatarSG: at this moment you started bullying him ingame
[0:49:18] GE0RG22: you won't get to 4th item this game I think
[0:49:31] jensap92: If you W Q, the Q damage hits first then the W procs. Since it's Magic damage it crits.

[0:52:28] VAIN64: shadowflame w and q is broken atm i think?
[0:52:32] Auris_: @MokuwuYo 2 dirks so he can have one in each hand
[0:52:37] Hauf_: dealing magic damage can be a way to counter armor, in a way its like armor pen
[0:52:51] VAIN64: with ez shadowflame if u w and q them on 50% and it gets them below 35% it will crit
[0:52:59] capitan_alexis: What?
[0:53:10] capitan_alexis: Q is not magic dmg
[0:53:10] MokuwuYo: @Auris_ it makes sense
[0:53:26] MokuwuYo: no more axes for draven

[1:39:33] lois25: i've seen a lot of ER and navori, it looks good
[1:39:42] mullerinn42: ER!
[1:39:58] pk_true: is your ezreal better then Hanql
[1:39:58] pepsio: D:
[1:40:28] Dragdar: MM rush was always = to trinity  rush people just liked the Trinity feel
[1:40:33] Dragdar: Might be better now with AD ratio buffs
[1:40:51] Auris_: dragdar here to take notes i see
[1:41:07] Auris_: ( Kappa )
[1:41:21] xcalebur: you were killed (in game)
[1:41:28] dea1hwish: ( Kappa )
[1:41:43] xcalebur: POSTURE
[1:42:16] Nikushaa: so is hwei supp legit?
[1:44:08] pk_true: Beryl rush it every game in LCK
[1:44:08] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr
[1:44:22] Nikushaa: he played hwei?
[1:44:37] Rutzou: not wrong
[1:44:40] xcalebur: legend alacrity on senna moment
[1:45:01] Nikushaa: why not just build liandry if you don't give a shit about mana tho
[1:45:19] Auris_: is there stat tracking on the horizon dmg amp
[1:46:02] JustRuza: BeryL has played it 3 times in LCK so far. He's gone Shureyla's first each time. Horizon focus second in one of those.
[1:46:40] dea1hwish: it bad in pro games, or even in ranked it's disgusting? @Jackspektra
[1:46:40] scooterxoxo: movement speed scales with skill I guess. the better player the better utilized MS
[1:46:50] scooterxoxo: So best players in the world probably get more out of it
[1:47:07] scooterxoxo: + they are on team, MS could help them with objectives they communicate about
[1:47:10] scooterxoxo: timings etc
[1:47:54] Nikushaa: i guess shurelya + wq work nicely together for engage and disengage
[1:49:02] Nikushaa: it still has a passive i think
[1:49:11] Rutzou: it doesnt anymore
[1:49:21] Rutzou: only an active now
[1:49:24] xcalebur: lol
[1:49:25] mono_brown: OOF
[1:50:14] Dragdar: Common thing to do when they're low and you have Q + R is to fire both really fast slightly offset from each other so they literally have nowhere to dodge
[1:50:53] scooterxoxo: fire one too far right and the other too far left so they escape
[1:51:07] xcalebur: stinky item
[1:51:12] kyshihixd: im bricked
[1:51:25] Auris_: @kyshihixd Stare
[1:51:43] Seigida: hi, sorry if asked a lot, but you still go sherylda whit no lethality ?
[1:51:50] Nikushaa: how did that ori r not hit
[1:53:08] Fidus44: is it worth to buy, the armguard on adc een if you are not upgrading to zhonyas
[1:53:11] Prepo9: how come youre not playing the essence reaver + navori build?
[1:53:14] Kirby269: can we get a kaisa game PepoPopcorn
[1:53:18] ADCPurple: @Fidus44 ni
[1:53:20] ADCPurple: no
[1:53:27] ADCPurple: hello hello jack
[1:53:57] ADCPurple: Can IE get a buff
[1:54:30] scooterxoxo: IE shud give 40% crit
[1:54:32] 365Doors: zhonyas is not bad if your adc has some ap ratios like varus or kaisa tho
[1:54:34] knightthrower: pls no kaisa, was good for long time
[1:54:48] Fidus44: @scooterxoxo that would be menacing
[1:54:50] ADCPurple: every single item in the game is better than crit, cheaper than crit and have more unique and fun passives than crit
[1:54:55] TerroXor4: Did u try the shadowflame ezreal tech already you talked about earlier? @Jackspektra
[1:54:59] stoutjesdijk: How do you deal with a bad support?
[1:55:07] Kirby269: kaisa seems ok with a nice engage support
[1:55:12] h0llw: just give me back kraken with true dmg SadgeCry
[1:55:13] Nikushaa: imagine if ie gave 40 crit instead of crit dmg... sounds kinda interesting
[1:55:15] rases00: seems that this season phreak doesn't like damage goes big items, like ie and deathcap. Both feel so bad.
[1:55:22] 365Doors: HUH
[1:55:41] TerroXor4: @rases00 HUH deathcap is stronger than ever
[1:55:47] McLegendzoce: !lvp
[1:55:47] Nightbot: HERETICS GAMES ARE STREAMED ON www.twitch.tv/lvpes OR www.twitch.tv/werlyb (costreaming it)

[1:59:02] Rutzou: fiora
[1:59:05] ADCPurple: i have seen that 1 fiora bot go er in EU
[1:59:11] Prepo9: @scooterxoxo Kalista renata is good
[1:59:14] scooterxoxo: oh
[1:59:23] xcalebur: kalista renata is one of the best combos
[1:59:37] ADCPurple: xayah here would have been goated
[1:59:56] McLegendzoce: see im onto something
[2:00:11] Rutzou: oh its not even blackpink fiora
