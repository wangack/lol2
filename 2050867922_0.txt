[0:34:42] PickLad: not sure whats best second tho, might be shadow over deathcap
[0:35:46] JWM102: deathcap 2nd would be inefficient no ?

[0:38:47] guiltyprawn: If I could, i would game until i die of old age. I work shifts (morning, evenings or nights) so i dont always have time. santorinFine
[0:38:57] Northlane0: As someone with 2 kids - having 7-8 blows my mind that people can handle that
[0:39:10] shadow7master: he can have 5v5 at home KEKW
[0:39:13] SacredPoultry: Nah nah either 5 or 10, that way he can field a full team or both sides of a league game
[0:39:20] PickLad: if you have 4 kids you can form your own league team
[0:39:36] Ace_strup: y all u guys not have amazon prime, get it for santorin!

[0:41:13] getsometalentloser: i went back to toplane cause I got frustrated with jungle
[0:41:14] Soff199: i'm so curious about the technology we'll have to play videogames when we're old. I hope we'll have some cool things to make it more accessible to old people
[0:41:24] guiltyprawn: I touch grass daily. Except during winters. Many months with 0 memory of grass. kermitChristmas

[0:52:05] tonyj199216: whose your favorite NA mid and why is it Jensen?
[0:52:09] supercole2001: gym is the best I was in a terrible mood the other night so I went to the gym at 10pm and then Iâ€™m back to normal
[0:52:19] basik: broxah is almost as good of a league player as he is a good person
[0:52:20] blueknight0007: @Santorin i wish you and broxah would do a tournament against each other.
[0:52:25] thedubbleblue: i thought shaco always start red side chickens?
[0:52:41] cutymiaow: Agree
[0:52:52] tidepodgod91: OMEGALUL
[0:53:06] Northlane0: I feel that you're more of a jokingly toxic person and you dont openly flame in game though - there's a huge difference IMO
[0:53:11] blueknight0007: @Santorin i like watching you for your sound effects and reactions
[0:53:16] Northlane0: Nothing is ever serious - amen
[0:53:23] GreenBaePackers: Super glad to see you're still around the scene and have a positive outlook on life VirtualHug

[0:54:20] zarkkast: Jax Pog
[0:55:08] Northlane0: hahaha worth
[0:55:09] KobzReformed: calculated
[0:55:14] shadow7master: worf
[0:55:18] tonyj199216: mental advantage
[0:55:21] u56828878: that was pretty damn cool
[0:55:29] getsometalentloser: o its joke box shaco
[0:55:31] BenjaminGreen: i didnt know you could q - flash that fast
[0:55:44] basik: at least both teams are griefing
[0:55:56] Northlane0: Because that was such a dumb play from K'Sante you didnt even think that it would have been a possibility. To high IQ
[0:56:18] shadow7master: hwei is master so
[1:00:19] Grumpmeister: Ganged up by the teletubs
[1:00:33] SonicSlice: no one has ever said that
[1:00:38] KobzReformed: seeing pyke alot more recently
[1:01:43] motorboater2: the sheild on the grubs is way too big
[1:01:45] Grumpmeister: What is it that makes support so strong this season (or well, it feels like, my wife is also happy with S14 as a support)? The item?
[1:01:53] zarkkast: half the team's deaths xdd
[1:02:25] Grumpmeister: Like, it seems like she is also embracing the roam strats more these days, which was always good, but still
[1:02:35] KobzReformed: seems impossible to win
[1:02:45] basik: they are buying so many pinks
[1:03:22] broski_gringo: Ff15
[1:03:38] grapeboyswole: it literally feels like suffocating
[1:03:44] grapeboyswole: yeah holy fuck
[1:03:48] KobzReformed: i wish people would 15 more often
[1:04:02] basik: maybe 3 item lillia can carry
[1:04:20] shadow7master: ez win in team fights
[1:04:47] Ghostcometh: sounds like the play is just to play a sup in jng right?
[1:04:52] grapeboyswole: if your teammates would play with mid game in mind at all it wouldnt be so hard
[1:04:58] Gargantix: Computer says no
[1:05:42] zarkkast: Smolder gap
[1:05:42] TurboScenePubStar: This pyke is making smolder look playable
[1:05:43] KobzReformed: aand they vote no
[1:05:46] GreenBaePackers: Nice try, hard game
[1:05:47] KobzReformed: NA
[1:05:52] Ghostcometh: play sup in jng duhhhhhh
[1:05:58] BenjaminGreen: @TurboScenePubStar LUL
[1:06:06] grapeboyswole: yeah i usually dont feel that bad about the game, but this looks fucking awful man
[1:06:17] SacredPoultry: @Ghostcometh pretty sure they call that Ivern
[1:06:26] KobzReformed: if you win 50 gifted
[1:06:37] motorboater2: @KobzReformed cap
[1:07:13] Ghostcometh: @SacredPoultry lmao touche
[1:08:41] shadow7master: KEKW
[1:08:47] TurboScenePubStar: I disagree. If ksante was OP would they really be pick/banning him in EVERY pro game? He must be bad
[1:08:54] solidussovis: how many Ksante nerfs have there been since his release, and he is still a broken champ
[1:09:10] EdgedSilver: I swear every time I see Ksante play, I'm heavily reminded of Sylas, like even just modern Sylas is that ridiculous
[1:09:13] KobzReformed: im so sick of pro play blabbing about ksante
[1:09:17] KobzReformed: its getting old
[1:09:47] ajak636: it's the tank items too i think
[1:10:00] TurboScenePubStar: NONO He isnt disgustiing because while on the one hand you can blind pick him toplane with almost no bad matchups, on
[1:10:09] iiNumb3rz: Ksante eventually going to get the yuumi treatment
[1:10:13] TurboScenePubStar: on the other hand he scales and carries
[1:10:17] humitt: what's that on enemy's botlane? new champ?
[1:10:19] Grumpmeister: Santorin is having a Stockholm syndrome with this game
[1:10:30] friend101: Purple ksante makes me think "oh cool, people are playing Mundo again!" Then I get disappointed
[1:10:32] Grumpmeister: Or Kopenhagen syndrome, if we want to keep it Danish
[1:10:36] EdgedSilver: items only exascivate the problem, Sejuani hasn't been strong for literal years
[1:10:46] eams90: bro, lillia is op af
[1:10:46] TurboScenePubStar: @EdgedSilver thats cap
[1:10:55] TurboScenePubStar: Sej is good
[1:11:04] EdgedSilver: doesn't make her strong.
[1:11:13] Gargantix: @Santorin tilt activated Prayge just go next and reset mental
[1:11:14] EdgedSilver: she can never run the map
[1:11:20] TurboScenePubStar: Or atleast sej was good like 2 months ago
[1:11:22] solidussovis: That's what is great about you Santo. The optimism for the game
[1:11:39] iiNumb3rz: Sejuani is just balanced. Not op.
[1:11:44] Northlane0: Who just melted you? smoldr?
[1:11:52] zarkkast: Shaco flash OMEGALUL
[1:11:57] ajak636: if only sejuani kept her pre-reworked ult BibleThump
[1:11:58] EdgedSilver: exactly! so she can't ever be strong in amongst these titans
[1:12:11] bonusdmg2noobs: talon no ghostblade KEK
[1:12:11] koushik_10: btw smolder does magic and true damage
[1:12:18] Goriyay: what support would u have preferred this game
[1:12:32] EdgedSilver: don't forget he has a free elder drake
[1:12:32] iiNumb3rz: She isn't strong in solo q because you cant depend on your team two have more than two brain cells that's aren't getting divorced.
[1:12:54] iiNumb3rz: @goriyay any engage works lol
[1:12:55] BenjaminGreen: i love morg jg into tf
[1:13:02] shadow7master: naut or rell would be good here for u
[1:13:14] EdgedSilver: same Ben haha, my otp
[1:13:15] TurboScenePubStar: Just because a champ cant solo carry in pubs doesnt make them a "bad" champ
[1:13:18] Goriyay: @iiNumb3rz bet bet
[1:13:26] iiNumb3rz: Engage supports are broken but people perma locking enchanters
[1:13:30] Gargantix: @BenjaminGreen people still play that? what colour do you start?
[1:13:34] koushik_10: how funny is it play when has so much cc but ur team has none
[1:13:39] koushik_10: feels great
[1:14:11] EdgedSilver: I never said she was bad lmao, but if a full tank can't play the game because enemy team picked a modern champ then she's not nearly OP, or even strong
[1:14:28] BenjaminGreen: @BenjaminGreen red or blue depending on team, shes not popular but i love it lol. always strong
[1:14:33] TurboScenePubStar: @Santorin You look just like Chriss Pratt
[1:14:38] bankeis: I really enjoy playing gwen jungle latley
[1:14:45] ajak636: what do u think of rell jungle?
[1:14:58] SacredPoultry: so kinda engage lockdown would be nice
[1:15:00] getsometalentloser: good but ur putting everything into@ur teams hands
[1:15:02] Gargantix: @BenjaminGreen would you ever go green? what's your first item?
[1:15:02] iiNumb3rz: Rell jng loves some grubbiea
[1:15:06] blubbubb: just a smol little bambi
[1:15:29] Gargantix: @iiNumb3rz how come we don't see rell jungle much now?
[1:15:48] BenjaminGreen: @BenjaminGreen meh not really, red/blue too good cause she loves burns and ms. dark harvest and usually liandries rush into zhonya/rift/mejai usually
[1:15:58] TurboScenePubStar: @iiNumb3rz Have you been watching pro? I saw like 2 rell jg's today
[1:15:59] getsometalentloser: rell is not a solo queue pick
[1:16:13] Gargantix: @BenjaminGreen why rift?
[1:16:21] EdgedSilver: Tell is the same issue as Sej
[1:16:23] heirjonp: a sitting deerâ€¦
[1:16:27] EdgedSilver: rell*
[1:16:39] BenjaminGreen: @BenjaminGreen just something im testing rn, goes well with liandry
[1:16:40] Grumpmeister: A sitting duck? More like a deer staring at the lights of an incoming truck Kappa
[1:16:43] bonusdmg2noobs: talon finally got a ghostblade jfc
[1:16:45] TurboScenePubStar: @EdgedSilver true
[1:16:53] bonusdmg2noobs: 27 minutes
[1:17:07] Grumpmeister: The truck is Pyke
[1:17:24] iiNumb3rz: @getsometalentloser there's a lot of picks that aren't great in solo q
[1:17:54] EdgedSilver: again I want to reiterate these champs have a use, but their uses are totally nullified by almost any carry
[1:18:03] holytoby: @Santorin I main top lane with my friends; was Emerald last season. I was 30% WR and got placed Gold this season. I switched to Support and now Im up to 65%... its crazy the impact you can have.
[1:18:04] iiNumb3rz: It sounds like what your saying is if you pick any type of engage or tank, your team doesn't do enough damage. Which I completelyagree with.
[1:18:28] EdgedSilver: not even just that, you can't ever carry yourself on these SPECIFIC champs
[1:18:31] shadow7master: literally sup carried the game
[1:18:38] EdgedSilver: take Malph as a counter example
[1:18:43] getsometalentloser: itâ€™s not just about damage playing tank jungle your putting ur ball in ur teams hands
[1:19:17] iiNumb3rz: @edgedsilver oh you can carry on them. It's just not easier than playing someone like lillia who does it but just better.
[1:19:21] getsometalentloser: u canâ€™t enable incompetent ppl so no matter how well u play  ur team also has to respond correctly cause u canâ€™t do anything by ur self
[1:19:24] iiNumb3rz: Like why make the game harder
[1:19:41] iiNumb3rz: I mean if you have melee top and mid, sejuani is really strong
[1:19:46] ScoobiSnax: good luck brother
[1:20:12] Grumpmeister: @iiNumb3rz Feels like it's very reliant on the mmr bracket you play in though
[1:20:20] EdgedSilver: well obviously, but that's what my whole argument is - overloaded modern champions make outdated or"forgotten" champs like Rell irrelevant to the game outside of pro
[1:20:56] holytoby: @Santorin I love tanks; in our comps for 5s I never try to carry just up lift my carries... so support comes naturally and Mao being OP really helps lol
[1:21:09] iiNumb3rz: I suppose. I mean I lock some rell on occasions that it fits. I usually don't lock engage tank unless my team has zero engage
[1:21:18] iiNumb3rz: That's just more of a draft diff though
[1:21:32] iiNumb3rz: Supports always want to play mages and top always wants to play carry
[1:21:38] koushik_10: can we see lathyrus cam ?
[1:21:38] getsometalentloser: I play tanks toplane but Iâ€™m very specific on the tanks I play
[1:21:53] solopker: what do you think of vi right now?
[1:22:05] holytoby: @iiNumb3rz So the opposite of me haha.
[1:22:22] iiNumb3rz: Bel velth feels so bad if you don't have a primary engage
[1:22:33] holytoby: @iiNumb3rz my friends get upset that I dont play more Fiora, jax, ect. I just dont have the mechanics.
[1:22:45] iiNumb3rz: A vi enjoyer. Must have been a former pro.
[1:22:54] Wildcobra_: good morning mr santorin
[1:23:03] TurboScenePubStar: I have legit not seen a belveth this season
[1:23:11] BenjaminGreen: you're the best multitasking streamer ive ever seen
[1:23:16] iiNumb3rz: @holytoby I'd play tanks if I was top. If I was a top laner I would literally one trick ksante.
[1:23:17] getsometalentloser: @turboscenepubstar  despite being very strong sheâ€™s not a popular champ
[1:23:19] Wildcobra_: not too bad ty, hbu?
[1:23:30] EdgedSilver: she's pretty insane to be honest, but her builds suffered
[1:23:32] iiNumb3rz: Stride breaker buff next patch
[1:23:35] Grumpmeister: Oh yeah, Stride is getting a big buff
[1:23:37] TurboScenePubStar: Stride and rage blade are getting buffs
[1:23:41] getsometalentloser: strikebreaker becomes a hydra item
[1:23:47] Gubbyfish: 2670 HUNDIGE REPRESENT
[1:23:47] Wildcobra_: ahhh riot games babyyy
[1:23:50] xvmay: Did u go to Santorini previously?
[1:23:53] getsometalentloser: @turboscenepubstar  donâ€™t build rage blade on bel veth
[1:23:58] getsometalentloser: itâ€™s like going full ad nocturne
[1:24:31] Grumpmeister: I've been flipflopping between Kraken - Titanic and Kraken - Stride on Bel'veth still, but yeah, it's just not the same
[1:24:31] TurboScenePubStar: @getsometalentloser But surely it is good 4th item
[1:24:58] getsometalentloser: @turboscenepubstar u pretty much specing into survivalability after 2 items
[1:25:33] PickLad: graggy
[1:25:35] waynekerrishere: Teemo angle
[1:25:37] BenjaminGreen: MORG ANGLE
[1:25:43] GhostxxHorse: Bel?
[1:25:43] BenjaminGreen: KEKW
[1:25:43] TurboScenePubStar: @getsometalentloser Fair. I mean I dont even play jg. I play mid and top so I really wouldnt know
[1:25:45] BurritoTX: gragas
[1:25:49] Goriyay: is kels streaming today? @Santorin
[1:25:49] ScoobiSnax: TROLL KING
[1:25:50] EdgedSilver: MORG
[1:25:55] waynekerrishere: Teemo is king here
[1:25:57] shadow7master: gragas or lee
[1:26:01] EdgedSilver: sadge
[1:26:01] Wildcobra_: as an adc player, can you maybe give me some insight on how to play weakside when their jung is camping me?
[1:26:34] getsometalentloser: @turboscenepubstar  bel veth is a champ that suffers from having a lot of noob trap items and ppl not knowing what the champs objectives are in terms of playing out the tame
[1:26:42] getsometalentloser: so I donâ€™t blame you
[1:26:44] yactavius82: lee
[1:26:44] EdgedSilver: honestly cobra, have a good support, or play under your inner tower from minute one LUL
[1:27:01] shadow7master: teemo always the GIGACHAD
[1:27:10] Wildcobra_: emerald-diamond
[1:27:18] lambchop24: morning @santorin !
[1:28:01] Wildcobra_: yea, i tilt so hard when my supp and jung are just on the other side of the map and im here like :))))
[1:28:18] EdgedSilver: I find it so strange that no-one picks mages or anti carries not lane right now
[1:28:22] petersen_lol: are you playing on EUw or Na?
[1:28:27] EdgedSilver: bot*
[1:28:50] Wildcobra_: i played weakside so well one game, then got flammed cause the other adc was stronger than me and doing dmg :)
[1:29:23] EdgedSilver: @wildcobra_ you rolled apes that game ig, happens
[1:29:32] Wildcobra_: :)
[1:29:50] EdgedSilver: feels just as bad as jng tbh DW xD
[1:30:28] DaveSnow: He didn't even get lvl 2 damn
[1:30:33] EdgedSilver: ez and Karma needed buffs tho lol
[1:30:37] Wildcobra_: i hate it so much when their jung and mid are constantly bot, nd mine just isnt
[1:30:40] Wildcobra_: its ssdgeee
[1:31:17] HarryBlopper: so i tried a normal game with ap smolder mid... that shit was fucking awful for the first 30 min... after that is aight
[1:31:20] bonusdmg2noobs: Bot laners are so clueless about early game jungle constraints
[1:33:00] shadow7master: trick2g Pog
[1:33:16] kensuke271: Are u back in denmark now?
[1:33:25] petersen_lol: did reng actually flash?
[1:33:28] iiNumb3rz: Yeah he is
[1:33:53] EdgedSilver: @bonusdmg2noobs to be fair every lane is pretty blind to it, jungle just got enormous nerfs due to the map change, that most other roles can't really comprehend just like that
[1:34:07] iiNumb3rz: How did senna cc miss? It went right through her
[1:34:37] EdgedSilver: @iinumb3rz high ground probably? they made it worse with map changes
[1:34:52] iiNumb3rz: A small indie company
[1:35:34] iiNumb3rz: Did gragas really just r that?
[1:35:46] iiNumb3rz: Seems a big wasteful
[1:35:56] getsometalentloser: udyr griefed that
[1:36:14] Grumpmeister: lmao
[1:36:36] lol_levart: that works in pro play so ig its just the neeko effect
[1:36:43] iiNumb3rz: Gragas cant be mad at anyone after that r
[1:37:04] runer_2xc: not high elo until your rank 1
[1:37:21] runer_2xc: if your not 1st your last LUL
[1:37:29] Grumpmeister: I loved the Neeko interaction in the LCS I think it was, last weekend. Transforming into a minion to avoid a Varus ult
[1:37:42] iiNumb3rz: Bro chill. Wtf you on man?
[1:37:48] Grynox15: I've been watching your stream for 5 minutes and I love how you are talking and informing us about the game. Great job!
[1:37:49] iiNumb3rz: What leesin combo even is that?
[1:37:55] JMSP88: clinic
[1:37:57] shadow7master: santorin cracked Pog
[1:38:12] iiNumb3rz: @grynox15 he hasn't even given the best advice yet.
[1:38:18] EdgedSilver: be kind, Lee is blind.
[1:38:32] Northlane0: yuuuuge
[1:38:34] nwa4lifeTV: plate :)
[1:38:42] Grynox15: @iiNumb3rz Good to know, I'll stick around
[1:38:55] nwa4lifeTV: nvm 3 kills > plate
[1:39:05] iiNumb3rz: @grynox15 ask him what his best solo q tip is. Do it.
[1:39:06] nizano: cmonBruh
[1:39:11] BleachIceCream: santorins best advice is always call ur teammates teletubbies when they're bad that way u dont get banned xdd
[1:39:12] petersen_lol: do you think griefing tempo for bc here is worht?
[1:39:20] WorstDraven: !delay
[1:39:48] EdgedSilver: do you ever rush ravenous on Lee @santorin ? something I see Broxah do from time to time when playing to carry
[1:39:53] larsit0: lee fed is best champ in league
[1:40:00] Northlane0: no delay and no map cover - likes to live dangerously as Austin Powers would say
[1:40:30] iiNumb3rz: You know i played this champ before and I dont do damage like that.
[1:40:38] stunt: 609 raiders from stunt have joined! 
[1:41:03] Ghostloon: stuntRoam STUNT RAID stuntRoam
[1:41:03] iiNumb3rz: Huge raid. Santorin getting the love.

[1:51:39] petersen_lol: casually healing full hp at baron what is this :D
[1:52:21] mkramer2000: Is it easier to get the visa because you are married?

[1:53:11] petersen_lol: i think youre a bit 1v9 its not about winnersq xD
[1:53:38] ssbm_worm: gdi i missed a fed lee game
[1:53:38] solidussovis: My brother in law is Canadian. My sister American. He has dual citizenship and it was pretty guaranteed. Its a avenue to look into if her visa does get denied for any reason
[1:53:45] shadow7master: KEKW
[1:54:03] getsometalentloser: support mains and full frontal lobotomies such is life
[1:54:08] akimonkey: cant believe this also happens in high elo
[1:54:15] skylarc88: if she cant come to DK, apply for her in Sweden, they let everyone in, and you can commute really easy to Dk  , especially if your Copenhagen
[1:54:50] redtauro: Susge
[1:55:12] shadow7master: santorin griefing himself KEKW
[1:55:19] blubbubb: elo boosted teammates in iron
[1:55:28] Grumpmeister: Yeah, the wait for a visa is so nervewrecking in a way
[1:55:50] Dntspeedup: agreed santorinWave
[1:56:52] blubbubb: oooh
[1:56:56] blubbubb: Neeko on a secret mission
[1:57:28] Fun_Mo: Toxic smh
[1:57:38] DemionDemon: good morning mate
[1:58:42] Breedlove00: go for end fuck it
[1:58:48] koushik_10: just hit the nexus smh
[1:58:50] Breedlove00: ward for udyr tp
[1:58:50] eMbbuZomg: If you lose this game idk
[1:58:58] Dntspeedup: santorinW santorinW santorinW
[1:59:22] koushik_10: XD
[1:59:24] Grynox15: Well, that is extremely frustrating
[1:59:40] buddrplays: how all my games have been this season very tragic
[1:59:45] drfellas: well you could atleast help with vision on map.. could help the team not to die all@the time
[2:00:10] alabamahammer02: Hey do you ever plan on doing a meme day or something and letting chat choose your Jungler? xD xD @Santorin
[2:00:12] ULTRATHlCC: fk u gg no re
[2:00:15] buddrplays: @drfellas delusional
[2:00:19] Burgerbrater1702: bro drfellas must be challenger
[2:00:27] shadow7master: senna man solo lost an ez game
[2:00:30] brightdiscord: bro just control your teammates so they dont int wtf
[2:00:36] mkramer2000: That's so frustrating you guys had the win and they just ran it down
[2:00:39] drfellas: well this looks like bronze with that map lol
[2:01:36] DemionDemon: @buddrplays well he could do that but whats the point? they cant leave the base. the only thing vision will d o is giving them a better view of the enemy taking objectives.
[2:01:59] eMbbuZomg: show replay
[2:02:04] eMbbuZomg: how many autos did senna do
[2:02:10] blubbubb: I'd argue vision could potentially allow a pick or two, slowly bringing them back?
[2:02:17] nwa4lifeTV: senna was hitting
[2:02:31] asticx2: Korean Lee Sin
[2:02:41] nwa4lifeTV: replay time
[2:03:27] eMbbuZomg: he did 1 that healed u aswell i think
[2:03:43] nuky_999: ye they went for gragas, if they ignore and try to end you prob end
[2:04:07] solidussovis: I think RIOT seen a jungle in the top 10 and went "Not on this fugging patch" straight to lossers que
[2:04:14] haff_: honestly it feels like every year the game outcome becomes more and more dictated by the worst performing players in the game than the best
[2:04:24] rexxarhero4: maybe play some jax jgl
[2:04:27] rexxarhero4: so u can outscale enemy team
[2:04:30] shadow7master: varus dmg KEKW
[2:04:42] eMbbuZomg: that game was unlucky with the 7 jungle bans no vi Sadge
[2:04:44] brightdiscord: i think it's an ezreal jungle angle
[2:04:57] lurkis2jerkis: true leads are so fleeting in modern league
[2:05:04] criticwhospeaksfacts: @Santorin you were 9/1, nasus split push without tp. you had full prior all game, why does riot nerf snowballing? how can people solo carry these day?
[2:05:08] nuky_999: ye but then there is no comeback, winning t eam would pretty much always win
[2:05:47] lurkis2jerkis: them getting soul was disaster
[2:05:52] nuky_999: how was the bounty system back in season 6/7 and stuff
[2:06:00] eMbbuZomg: what bounty system
[2:06:08] solopker: vi game if it looks good?
[2:06:11] Grynox15: @Santorin Do you ever utilize some of the Chinese Lee mechanics?
[2:06:12] lurkis2jerkis: teletubbies KEKW
[2:06:19] blubbubb: any thoughts on the gold distribution? or you just happened to get all the kill gold? knowing Lee Sin falls off late?
[2:06:33] eMbbuZomg: i was talking about s6/7
[2:06:46] eMbbuZomg: but ye bounty as in objective bounty
[2:06:52] JayBee_: @Santorin peepoHey
[2:07:06] blubbubb: I'm asking as I did not see the whole game
[2:07:09] nuky_999: I remember in older seasons you would have bounty but was different, I even forgot how it worked
[2:07:17] GhostxxHorse: @JayBee_ santorinWave santorinWave santorinWave
[2:07:23] Ghostcometh: bring allflame back plz
[2:07:27] haff_: @nuky_999 but winning team is the winning team for a reason right? im not saying that there shouldnt be any comeback but the way they do feels too artificial
[2:07:35] JayBee_: @GhostxxHorse ratirlHey broxahCool
[2:07:38] eMbbuZomg: i genuinely cant remember was there even shutdown bounties in s6
[2:07:44] eMbbuZomg: surely u didnt get 1k gold from killing a fed player
[2:07:59] nuky_999: it was
[2:08:12] nuky_999: you would have the coin thingy next to your name if I remember
[2:08:18] eMbbuZomg: ye but wasnt it lik 400?
[2:08:19] eMbbuZomg: not 1k
[2:08:23] nuky_999: ye it was much lower
[2:08:35] nuky_999: you could play more risky and go for plays
[2:08:37] haff_: i think it used to be max 600g for bounty
[2:08:40] lurkis2jerkis: so true
[2:08:45] BicepSlicerBoy: Hello sandwich man! Hope you have some fun games today! Jungle is so weak this season tbh.
[2:08:46] lurkis2jerkis: bounties stack so fast
[2:09:16] nuky_999: they should limit it to 400g bounty
[2:09:16] eMbbuZomg: it doesnt matter in current season enemy can almost always throw everything at you and kill you for 1k and go 3:1 trade and be ahead on that play
[2:09:17] shadow7master: it was max 600g on kill but no global bounty like dragon and towers
[2:09:21] lurkis2jerkis: i play against sion had a 700 bounty at 8 mins, died to kat instantly lost. yesterday
[2:10:16] solelyflerken: but without bounties everygame is ff 15 although it already is
[2:10:32] nuky_999: yes it feels the more ahead you are the bigger chance is you throw KEKW
[2:10:59] nuky_999: ah we are 5k gold ahead, lets not lose boys from one bad play
[2:11:19] haff_: bounty on objectives are stupid too i think.. you can int splitpush and get a ton of gold if u get like 2 towers and a random dragon
[2:11:31] Dntspeedup: santorinHype santorinHype santorinWave santorinWave santorinWave
[2:11:40] nuky_999: they should make tier 2 turrets more tanky, they are so squishy for 675g
[2:11:44] shadow7master: rell sup u can play relaxed now
[2:12:01] potato_pancakes2: poppy
[2:12:03] eMbbuZomg: Last time i played ranked more than 10 games was s6 (was mid diamond), i started ranked again this season in emerald 2 but im so lost now LuL
[2:12:07] alabamahammer02: They should pay us $1k for listening to your bounty rant! kekw
[2:12:09] Tritros: fighting pro vi?
[2:12:26] lurkis2jerkis: @eMbbuZomg yeah this happened to me it took a lot of grinding to get it back
[2:12:56] eMbbuZomg: Transition from toplane to just playing fill, I think i wanna switch to support since it seems like a lot of impact on games and my wr on supp is by far highest
[2:13:16] lurkis2jerkis: @eMbbuZomg this ssns way better for old players than the mythic item seasons imo
[2:13:35] nuky_999: @Santorin what is the biggest diff in jng now compared to season6
[2:13:38] DemionDemon: make a coherent bounty rant so i can clip it and glue it to the Showmaker KSante rant.
[2:13:39] Dntspeedup: santorinFine santorinFine santorinFine
[2:13:48] Dntspeedup: santorinComfy
[2:13:54] lolCrazyBear: a kha game pog
[2:14:25] Dntspeedup: who is vi?
[2:14:34] eMbbuZomg: I tried to play some jg games but i feel so useless if my support/laners are not playing with me
[2:14:38] Chris13372k4: vi  was  in the last game adc
[2:14:39] jonasthr1: @Dntspeedup comp
[2:14:40] lolCrazyBear: @Dntspeedup comp
[2:14:53] Dntspeedup: ooooo santorinSad
[2:15:02] lurkis2jerkis: oh yeah that old overgrowth thing LULW
[2:15:11] ssbm_worm: graves is always op...
[2:15:41] lolCrazyBear: do you evolve r or q on kha?
[2:15:41] ssbm_worm: he's not lillia yea LOL
[2:15:47] FerventApathy: Maybe you shouldn't judge a player off such a small sample size.
[2:16:01] lurkis2jerkis: khaz is such a vibe
[2:16:05] DemionDemon: spoiler alert - Graves and Gwen are a thing.
[2:16:15] lolCrazyBear: base on what do you decide which one to evolve?
[2:16:18] eMbbuZomg: i miss playing kha mid
[2:16:19] DemionDemon: according to "lore"
[2:16:26] eMbbuZomg: i forgot what season that was but kha mid was fun
[2:17:43] lurkis2jerkis: @eMbbuZomg manamune kha ðŸ’€
[2:17:48] gyurcimurci: you mean yesterday and today
[2:17:55] GraveRNG: how is qiyana jungle at the minute?
[2:18:09] shadow7master: ksante on enemy team always win but in your team get gaped KEKW
[2:18:51] Ab176: Im pretty sure that bot matchup is unplayable
[2:19:12] nuky_999: @Santorin who would you rank as top 3 soloq junglers in euw, is kaostanza one of them
[2:19:30] eMbbuZomg: are u supposed to just ignore bot in situation like that where u lose 3v3
[2:20:40] DemionDemon: tf is this vision? LEC game much?
[2:21:06] Ab176: maybe he wants to do the 3v3 bot so it's a quick 15 ff
[2:21:26] Tritros: looks like when I play jungle 3 losing lanes and getting spammed pinged
[2:21:33] SacredPoultry: pop back in for a kzix game lessgo
[2:21:34] Madkat4000: u got 27 roaches in ur ashtray?
[2:21:34] lurkis2jerkis: the first grub is the most important one by far i think
[2:21:53] lurkis2jerkis: gives double the XP
[2:22:15] mate72: what do you usually upgrade with k6 R progression?
[2:22:27] hansel_lionheart: they got bored
[2:22:55] Griefclaw: vi 0 ganks i always love these games as a jungler
[2:23:02] DaveSnow: Are there many wintraders these days in challenger?
[2:23:31] nuky_999: brain lag
[2:23:34] lurkis2jerkis: he was not ready for that
[2:23:36] lurkis2jerkis: LULW
[2:23:46] lolCrazyBear: what a fun game of league of legends
[2:23:55] shadow7master: brain delay KEKW
[2:24:03] Tritros: vlad was too busy changing his music
[2:24:10] SacredPoultry: whats the determining factor for R vs Q upgrade at 6?
[2:24:14] eams90: gg
[2:24:19] eams90: 5 0 min 10 kali
[2:24:25] nuky_999: team gap
[2:24:55] EAMS12: nice ign @eams90
[2:25:13] Ab176: the fungus in your bot lanes minds is probably whispering jungle gap in their ears
[2:25:19] JayBee_: eavLETSGO
[2:25:23] EAMS12: do you think theres any jgler that could help them early here?
[2:25:33] eams90: @EAMS12 lol those are my initials
[2:25:52] shadow7master: @EAMS12 not a chance with that bot
[2:25:53] eams90: south american
[2:25:56] Ab176: he's due for a good game now
[2:26:07] lurkis2jerkis: why do rengars take future market over cosmic insight? when going electro.  is it just better?
[2:26:52] eams90: @lurkis2jerkis its a prefference thing... I rather have more smites for more gold/xp and more uptime on profane hydra active... but thats me
[2:27:05] lurkis2jerkis: @eams90 thats what im sayin
[2:27:22] Ab176: your team is so kind generating bounties for you to collect
[2:27:38] eams90: its a prefference thing though, some really good players prefer futures... maybe for a near guaranteed tiamat first back
[2:27:47] i_publius: Smolder jungle?
[2:27:59] JayBee_: JayBee_ subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:28:05] lurkis2jerkis: @eams90 i think its prolly just too important to play around spikes + guarenteed teamat on 2nd clear
[2:28:21] eams90: yeh
[2:28:22] lurkis2jerkis: but at the same time a wana greed cosmic so bad
[2:28:32] JayBee_: santorinCheers
[2:28:36] eams90: i prefer cosmic, I find more value on it
[2:28:59] eams90: but I also understand why people switch it for futures too
[2:29:09] Ab176: three losing lanes = bad monkaHmm
[2:29:11] SacredPoultry: Umbral Glaive still viable?
[2:29:54] sebacu01: KEKW
[2:29:58] Xainfried_: LOL
[2:30:00] shadow7master: vlad KEKW
[2:30:14] Ab176: vlad r is a hard skillshot
[2:30:29] eams90: thats an ally team vlad lol
[2:30:42] lurkis2jerkis: sad that this vlad needs to carry LULW
[2:30:53] koheed11: Make your own universe!
[2:31:27] Ab176: wow what is the seraphs shield cooldown
[2:31:44] shadow7master: avengers
[2:32:39] shadow7master: KEKW
[2:32:44] HarryBlopper: watching you go step by step of your thought process makes me realise how many mistakes even challengers make
[2:33:10] MouldyCheesePie: if u didnt use money on lucidity+edge of night, and bought more dmg, would you have been able to kill her right?
[2:33:33] Ab176: if vlad gets kali bounty its over
[2:33:40] lurkis2jerkis: @HarryBlopper true, usually when challengers make a mistake there is a good thought behind it. something to learn usually
[2:33:56] MouldyCheesePie: TY for assassin tips about moving across the map quickly. Any other tips?
[2:33:57] shadow7master: @Ab176 not this vlad KEKW
[2:33:58] imKennart: There was a pink in the pixel brush bot
[2:34:13] zarkkast: xdd
[2:34:17] sharpeim: bruh wtf, fiora legit had more burst
[2:34:18] DarkLonios: xd
[2:34:22] lurkis2jerkis: WTF ONE AUTO and ONE Q lmfao
[2:34:28] zarkkast: She said "I'm the assassin"
[2:34:32] DaveSnow: Teemo double kills there
[2:34:36] sharpeim: it's phreak balancing
[2:34:40] Not__Drip: bruisher kha way better
[2:34:40] MouldyCheesePie: Hydra has the most dmg item
[2:34:44] imKennart: Ori placed it when you killed her on drag
[2:34:55] imKennart: But maybe she replaced it Shruge
[2:35:11] MouldyCheesePie: Nah assassin kha is super good but I think he used too much money on non-dmg items
[2:35:27] sharpeim: those are decent items that balance dmg and def
[2:35:35] sharpeim: fiora isn't going full burst either
[2:36:05] HarryBlopper: how do junglers secure drakes when mid and bot int or dont push properly?
[2:36:18] sharpeim: ik kha is good, but the way the interaction played out is kinda ridiculous
[2:37:37] 444Kanin: @HarryBlopper You dont.
[2:37:58] HarryBlopper: @444Kanin but then they flame me for not getting objectives BibleThump
[2:38:00] eMbbuZomg: its impressive ur ahead in gold to that vi with 8 towers to 1
[2:38:02] eMbbuZomg: 0*
[2:38:12] 444Kanin: @HarryBlopper welcome to JG
[2:38:37] SacredPoultry: full lethality build
[2:38:39] Velraptured: Losing solos=can't grubs. Grubs=most reliable wincon. Thus, losing solos=autolose game.
[2:38:49] HarryBlopper: also would you sometimes just give enemy soul if they already have 3 drakes and then compete for elder instead? @Santorin
[2:38:52] DemionDemon: its ok. go season 15. it`ll be better. trust.
[2:38:52] Ab176: grubs have not felt like a wincon in my game
[2:38:54] Velraptured: Drake is bait.
[2:39:09] JoJo_McFarley: Well santorin, as my friend would tell me if i complained about the same thing... Sounds like a skill issue Kappa
[2:39:26] HalfmanDaan: Hard facts
[2:39:43] HalfmanDaan: HalfmanDaan subscribed with Prime. 
[2:39:46] Ab176: has to be two people since it locks one person out of perma ffing
[2:40:05] eMbbuZomg: -50g
[2:40:06] criticwhospeaksfacts: another game where you are carrying but can't win because of riot's preventative measures to solo carry. this is so unfair
[2:40:11] HalfmanDaan: I am now subscribing to two Danish streamers, feelsbadman
[2:40:22] sharpeim: skill issue
[2:40:24] moosE3knucklE: 6 grubs on a Trundle top, Tristana mid combo @Ab176 if u have 5 champs who dont take towers well they kinda suck
[2:40:48] criticwhospeaksfacts: report your team
[2:41:00] HarryBlopper: would you sometimes just give enemy soul if they already have 3 drakes and then compete for elder instead? @Santorin
[2:41:03] lolCrazyBear: Have you tried jax jg?
[2:41:10] MouldyCheesePie: I'm not sure about edge of night second
[2:41:15] shadow7master: u getting shit teams man i guess its ur turn today KEKW
[2:41:22] blkcat: blkcat subscribed with Prime. 
[2:41:25] eric440: ok I'm here; the wins start now
[2:41:29] HalfmanDaan: Nah, If soloQ players could just warp their head around helping the jungler, this game would be easy
[2:41:36] HalfmanDaan: wrap*
[2:41:45] EAMS12: someone added you
[2:41:52] criticwhospeaksfacts: k sante trolled top becauses he didn't play properly being weak side and he is high elo. that's his fault
[2:42:32] Griefclaw: laners never weak side its so cringe
[2:42:42] eMbbuZomg: what was his name
[2:42:47] MouldyCheesePie: Opportunity and leaving boots at magical footwear gives you 700 extra gold, which you can spend on 2 lognswords for +20AD. Opportunity gives +5AD over Edge and like +10lethal
[2:43:01] Olliecus: What was did yesterday end at? Had to tune out after 4-0 became 4-4 :(
[2:43:52] n33dl3z: if 3 games in a row bot lane decides the game, would you say adc is a stronger role than jungle?
[2:43:58] MouldyCheesePie: Ur rly high rank atm, how come you're doing so well this season?
[2:44:01] sharpeim: is rumble jg any good
[2:44:30] eMbbuZomg: I had a game yday as gp vs tahm kench where tahm kench copped a triple kill lvl 1
[2:44:32] ToStrife: Junglers r supposed to be everywhere duh
[2:44:39] HarryBlopper: do you sometimes just give soul to enemy so you can compete for elder or is it better to deny soul if you can? @Santorin
[2:44:39] lurkis2jerkis: santorins a soloq goat
[2:45:05] MouldyCheesePie: Why would you reset before chall? Isn't it better practice?
[2:45:15] sharpeim: why doesn't riot give money prize for rank 1
[2:45:20] socasa: EU or NA?
[2:45:20] criticwhospeaksfacts: why does riot punish farming? Like if enemy paths bot, why can't you deny jgler's camps and get ahead and carry. Why does riot nerf that and allow jglers to gank and also farm without getting punished if enemy invades?
[2:45:24] MouldyCheesePie: Oh okay
[2:46:08] sharpeim: o ye that sucks
[2:46:28] MouldyCheesePie: Thoughts on karthus now? He seems to be better with DHarvest now than First Strike
[2:46:29] DemionDemon: look what happened to S1 of CQ in NA. i mean that sheet was cringe.
[2:46:29] ToStrife: @santorin does trying to hit rank 1 keep you from playing the way you really want?
[2:46:34] louiecheese: hello glorious jg king
[2:46:37] blkcat: Do you know the #1 rank?
[2:46:51] louiecheese: hello chat lil bros
[2:47:12] n33dl3z: is adc stronger than jungle right now?
[2:47:27] Ashura__Oni: Good day
[2:47:29] Ab176: I think the map changes made bot lane way more snowbally
[2:47:40] ToStrife: @santorin same bro i hate playing thr same champs over amd over
[2:47:41] DemionDemon: troll time @Santorin
[2:47:52] moosE3knucklE: you know. we see Trundle jungle in pro play but never Top. i feel like Trundle top is stronger. his tower sieging ablities are damn near unmatched.
[2:47:54] MouldyCheesePie: Who do you think best junglers are EUW? Agurin? Bo?
[2:47:56] Ab176: the longer lane makes it harder to safe push and if you have bot control it's really easy to gank red side but if they have control it feels impossible
[2:47:59] eMbbuZomg: sweatin time
[2:48:03] eMbbuZomg: its a lillia karma olaf draft
[2:48:04] Griefclaw: they need to bring back invading and putting the enemy jung like 4 levels down
[2:48:10] eMbbuZomg: ngl it looks over already
[2:48:15] haff_: maybe make camps respawn a bit slower? so you dont get so punished by passive full clear jungler if you try to gank
[2:48:28] qosk: !opgg
[2:48:29] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Santorini%20Panini-EUW & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/SantariniPanini-JGDIF & https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/ChatDisabler97-MUTE
[2:48:33] Zhaibot: would xin be bad here?
[2:48:36] haff_: or even be able to invade em
[2:48:43] criticwhospeaksfacts: how about nocturne, doesn't he farm fast, ulti counters splitpush comps. very strong dueler etc?
[2:48:55] eMbbuZomg: enemy has lcs draft
[2:49:03] DemionDemon: you could have gone Trundle here. like no joke.
[2:49:13] moosE3knucklE: Olaf mid?
[2:49:29] DemionDemon: Karma mid
[2:49:36] BaneBladeV: if you shut down a solo laner, you get a full level
[2:49:41] MouldyCheesePie: oh dear zac is going to feed hard
[2:49:48] eMbbuZomg: its autofill support playin top
[2:49:54] eMbbuZomg: i think zac is good for him PepeLaugh
[2:49:55] lurkis2jerkis: -3 Prayge
[2:49:55] MouldyCheesePie: how u know
[2:50:03] eric440: oh no
[2:50:06] Ashura__Oni: lol
[2:50:07] moosE3knucklE: dodged
[2:50:08] Ashura__Oni: again
[2:50:08] shadow7master: KEKW
[2:50:11] Ashura__Oni: hahha
[2:50:15] socasa: Lol you and trymbi on the same team going what is happening
[2:50:35] criticwhospeaksfacts: why can't riot developers get expert pro players or high elo players to form a committee to provide expert advice. All corporations do this, Riot Games is slow, these developers might have 500 iq to code things and use technology to manipulate data and look cool with their $300k fat salary but i don't care, they are prob max master elo or ex master/diamond players.
[2:50:37] Ashura__Oni: bullet dodge
[2:50:40] Ashura__Oni: that game
[2:50:42] Ashura__Oni: haha
[2:50:53] moosE3knucklE: oh that game was badddd
[2:51:17] eMbbuZomg: They can't balance around pro play cuz its 0.001% of the playerbase
[2:51:20] eMbbuZomg: the game will die
[2:51:26] DemionDemon: you got lucky on the dodge. now you have to blind Trundle. no matter what.
[2:51:31] eMbbuZomg: the game has to be fun for the gold players LuL
[2:51:35] BaneBladeV: garen 60% winrate, stuff like that right?
[2:52:00] eric440: so what you're saying is you want another k'sante buff
[2:52:05] sharpeim: i dunno that sounds pretty fun
[2:52:06] eric440: lol
[2:52:10] HarryBlopper: gotta find a sweet spot to cater for the 80% who is below plat
[2:52:15] shadow7master: lil tomy KEKW
[2:52:31] criticwhospeaksfacts: that's fine though right? low elo players can stick to annie and champs that have low skillcap. pro players will have their own meta champs?
[2:52:32] BrainlagsEverywhere: @Santorin just remove the ward jump and the x2 AD modifier in kick, easy lee sin fix
[2:52:40] eric440: low elo wont notice; do it
[2:52:50] xbentu: it's okay lil tommy :keepbeingmean:
[2:53:06] BaneBladeV: balancing for diamond is a good compromise
[2:53:17] Ab176: azir ryze aphelios perma 40% wr Aware
[2:53:19] sharpeim: ye thats true
[2:53:39] criticwhospeaksfacts: just balance for high elo players, that will improve the skill of the game, these noob players will naturally get better. they shouldn't lower their status to please gold elo players.
[2:53:43] eric440: I would agree but I am a lot meaner than u are
[2:53:47] DemionDemon: how many bronze players does it take to change a lightbulb?
[2:54:05] eMbbuZomg: propably 1, he is a handyman playing for fun on sunday evenings
[2:54:11] DemionDemon: none. they cant climb the ladder.
[2:54:15] sharpeim: if they only balance for high elo, op champs in low elo would just stay at the top and make it less fun for the other 80%+ players
[2:54:23] Ab176: I actually feel like they do a really good job with balancing in that aspect with the exception of the jungle role
[2:54:39] eric440: I genuinely forget iron exists
[2:54:46] HarryBlopper: were you about to call masters low elo LUL
[2:54:56] iiNumb3rz: You can come duo q with me in gold for the low elo experience. Seems like you need a refresher
[2:54:57] lolterror1: yo
[2:55:25] sharpeim: One you hit rank 1 for your first year, did you otp anything or just play meta?
[2:55:27] blkcat: i didnt know iron was a thing until i lived there perma :)
[2:55:30] eric440: hes too pure for our community lmao
[2:55:37] shadow7master: santorin didnt taste peasant life down there KEKW
[2:55:43] lolterror1: Just got the news you retired and checked up your socials, was the retirement your decision?
[2:55:45] DemionDemon: @eric440 cries in Rick Fox
[2:55:47] eMbbuZomg: @criticwhospeaksfacts that works if you are trying to make a highly competitive playground, not if you want to be a company make the most money
[2:55:47] moosE3knucklE: in the end its a video game
[2:55:59] solidussovis: League fails if they only focus on high elo. you have to make the masses happy to keep people playing
[2:56:05] ToStrife: I legitimately like to play this game and wow you would think the people that play this game fucking hate it lmak
[2:56:08] eMbbuZomg: riot gets their money from the casual player gettin home from work buying a 4th lux skin
[2:56:10] blueknight0007: Agreed but im constantly in a team diff scenario!
[2:56:17] solidussovis: and alot more people are in low elo then high elo
[2:56:20] iiNumb3rz: One problem in low elo is people first or second timing champs they have no clue how to play
[2:56:35] iiNumb3rz: Yes you can 1v9. But if I could 1v9 every game I wouldn't be in gold.
[2:56:54] lolterror1: @Santorin  can i ask ? why did you retire
[2:57:03] BaneBladeV: mid elo
[2:57:09] BaneBladeV: should be a concept
[2:57:11] CheefCake: @Santorin can't they remove autofill? We would wait longer for the queue to pop but it seems better than getting autofilled
[2:57:28] sharpeim: ye chose right
[2:57:35] koheed11: YEAH CANADA!!!!!
[2:57:48] criticwhospeaksfacts: Riot is a company I understand but they can't do everything and cater for all. If their market is to make profit and make the game free, balancing will always be an issue and skill cap will be limited. If they culled 60% of their playerbase to improve on balancing, all the pro players will be 10x better. riot will shrink in size, but so wha, it will be an exlcusive game where eventually you pay per month to play. Or maybe a new Moba will do this
[2:57:58] iiNumb3rz: Ive seen the lcs this year. Teams have to be calling you
[2:58:02] sharpeim: i swear 90% of masters+ players only have league in their life, even if they aren't making a career out of it
[2:58:03] eric440: based
[2:58:26] lolterror1: seems pretty much similar to  the opinion of bjerg, do y'all agree that league takes pretty much all your time ?
[2:58:30] Moedyy: you and kp live together in Denmark now?
[2:58:36] iiNumb3rz: Got tired of first picking sejuani so he retired kekw
[2:58:41] BleachIceCream: @criticwhospeaksfacts every company caters to shareholders and executives
[2:58:45] ULTRATHlCC: glad youve got a handle on things. work/life balance is so important
[2:58:46] BleachIceCream: nothing new
[2:58:54] eMbbuZomg: Lolegoless i dont think there is anything in the world you can be the best at without investing all your time
[2:58:57] eMbbuZomg: same for every sport
[2:59:55] sharpeim: it is a competitive game tbf
[3:00:01] Pipsquik: MONSTER ASIANS
[3:00:10] iiNumb3rz: Monster Asians kekw
[3:00:13] moosE3knucklE: well i wouldnt say that.
[3:00:19] DemionDemon: and then there`s Faker. who might not be the best now but he`s still relevant and on top of the game.
[3:00:25] solidussovis: That's why I just play aaram and watch Santo. I don't have the ability to dedicate that much time to a game
[3:00:38] iiNumb3rz: Got tired of first picking sejuani so he retired kekw
[3:00:38] eric440: more moving parts and complexity
[3:00:45] AManAndHisWeiner: whats your thoughts on trundle jungle?
[3:00:49] ULTRATHlCC: T1 also has to worry about kkoma's belt Kappa
[3:01:43] eMbbuZomg: lets see how ur toplaner rounds out this triple aa karma comp PepeLaugh
[3:01:45] JoJo_McFarley: So all this talk about retirement and what not, how are you enjoying the streamer schedule so far and the ability to flex it to whatever your own needs are?
[3:01:58] AManAndHisWeiner: im high bronze newb.. been running lillia since last season .. with graves and trundle
[3:02:12] JoieRide: KEKW
[3:02:14] stravoforos: hey! why everyone has stopped playing nidalee the new season?
[3:02:15] moosE3knucklE: i was a semi pro in CS. and Counterstrike does always change.  People find new smokes new ways to push bombsite. the game does evolve and they do like rework t he maps every so often (except mirage) in counterstrike EU is Asian LoL haha
[3:02:16] solidussovis: @eMbbuZomg Corki is less aa now and mostly RRRRRRRRR
[3:02:18] BleachIceCream: play nasus jungle to rank 1 u will be ultimate player
[3:02:41] eMbbuZomg: solidussovis yea i mean it depends if u go the first strike setup or hail with trinity
[3:02:44] eMbbuZomg: both viable builds
[3:02:45] eric440: you're ahead of the curve; most other people our age havnt figured out over-working is overrated
[3:02:48] lolterror1: @Santorin  could you please explain, why do all league players retire at 25 age gape
[3:02:48] AManAndHisWeiner: who do you play graves into.. i never know a good game for him
[3:02:50] solidussovis: @eMbbuZomg fair
[3:02:54] waynekerrishere: Can you give me some advice, I am hard stuck bronze and its starting to break me a little, I play nearly perfect with my zilean jungle but just can't win
[3:03:07] moosE3knucklE: no nothing like LoL no
[3:03:16] eMbbuZomg: i was watchin what the koreans are doin and they pretty much didnt even go malignance at all on corki
[3:03:20] eMbbuZomg: just triforce eclipse aa build
[3:03:33] moosE3knucklE: league is different yes
[3:03:47] mischa_d: imagine counterstrike removing every gone once a year and adding completly new ones
[3:03:53] sharpeim: cs pros are built different genetically
[3:04:07] ULTRATHlCC: how are they so close to their screen LOL
[3:04:11] alanalda: peepoHey
[3:04:13] JoJo_McFarley: I love how pro gamers are able to recognize the talents other pro gamers in a different game, it's always so fun to see
[3:04:40] eMbbuZomg: cs looks so easy when ur playing a lot of fps untill you realize you cant keep shooting after u miss ur 1st bullet if u dont know how each gun spray works
[3:04:43] eMbbuZomg: PepeLaugh
[3:04:57] moosE3knucklE: EU is Asian LoL... somehow they are always ahead of the curve. especially Danish CS its insane how far the Danes always held the meta in CS
[3:05:25] eMbbuZomg: im suprised theres no t1 asian team in cs yet
[3:05:42] moosE3knucklE: they had Tyloo in T1 for awhile
[3:05:44] DemionDemon: cs isnt that big in Korea
[3:06:40] DemionDemon: Brazil on the other hand...
[3:06:42] solidussovis: I used to play Halo 2 in a lot of tournaments. I was pretty good. Then I got older and thought the game got harder.... I just got worse
[3:06:52] BaneBladeV: looking like my average clear
[3:06:55] NorseThunder: they have their own cs rip off they play called sudden attack
[3:06:56] alanalda: its the same issue with why everybody misses that one baby krug, it seems like the aggro is shorter on the smaller ones
[3:07:45] eMbbuZomg: well atleast nunu stayed bot instead of snowballin to top grab
[3:08:06] DemionDemon: best LoL song hands down. i will die on this hill.

[3:17:33] DemionDemon: Karma *exists*
[3:17:36] solidussovis: Supp weak. 1 v 1 adc like that clearly a weak role
[3:17:47] BleachIceCream: bro just gank and kill them 4Head
[3:18:02] Ab176: ah you got knockup RNG'd back into the turret
[3:18:08] darkkkona: at what stack you call kindred hyper carry, 8 ?
[3:18:38] joshoewa: 8 does nothing
[3:18:46] joshoewa: its 4, 7, 10, 13, etc
[3:19:05] eric440: :)
[3:19:13] criticwhospeaksfacts: report the pig aatrox
[3:19:29] darkkkona: pathetic
[3:19:30] SyFish: Is kindred in a good spot this eason?
[3:20:07] solidussovis: That is fugging tilting. How long does that take to mark
[3:20:10] Ab176: you were moving too much you double procced red smite
[3:20:23] Griefclaw: surely there was a gank op top though, you can gank to save team mental sometimes
[3:20:34] Griefclaw: and not just not gank cause its optimal?
[3:20:39] darkkkona: gnarmut monkaS
[3:20:39] criticwhospeaksfacts: aatrox feeding agaib

[3:24:47] victoriancuddler: followed bc i need to watch someone playing kindred so i can learn kindred hello! HeyGuys
[3:24:57] capodeicapi7: when u were in TSM, who do u think was the best on the team?
[3:24:59] DemionDemon: how`s navori on Kindred?
[3:25:35] NorseThunder: aatrox straight running it at their team is kind of front line...
[3:25:49] criticwhospeaksfacts: @Santorin why not pick kindred every game, u can carry with big lead.
[3:26:42] DemionDemon: RFC next?
[3:26:51] ucandoit69: santorinW
[3:26:52] darkkkona: if enemy team plays for your marks you're done with kindred

[3:27:34] NorseThunder: does rapidfire increase your q range as well?
[3:27:41] DemionDemon: it does
[3:27:52] DemionDemon: works the same as TF cards
[3:28:13] Ray701: sadge
[3:28:14] irelia80t: @darkkkona most of people don't know how marks work, so it's not much of a problem, and kindred scales with marks, but still can manage to get without counter jungling much
[3:28:16] Ab176: ah didnt ban gentleman gnar it's just a coach gap
[3:28:33] lurkis2jerkis: frick!
[3:28:34] criticwhospeaksfacts: wtf is aatrox doing

[3:29:59] lubemila: feeling
[3:30:04] darkkkona: before nunu ult
[3:30:18] lubemila: autocorrect ðŸ¥µ
[3:30:40] criticwhospeaksfacts: you had positive kda every game, so on the bright side u arent tilted and u arent playing bad per say
[3:31:34] n33dl3z: are you growing out your hair?
[3:31:38] criticwhospeaksfacts: but their adc had 4k gold lead. riot makes it hard for u to carry even with a big lead because kaisa can say the same thing with her lead?
[3:32:13] 0ndion: whats the more tanky kindred build?
[3:32:22] eMbbuZomg: whats ur favourite support to play with
[3:32:34] DJ_Photik: Cheer100 good morning let's untilt u santorinLUL

[3:32:59] Ray701: what are your thoughts on triforce second?
[3:33:21] Ray701: ah i see
[3:33:45] criticwhospeaksfacts: @Santorin buy some snacks, drinks, go for a walk, sleep a lot, make a nice cuppa, hot shower, self-care and try tomorrow if you lose this next game
[3:33:58] darkkkona: bard main Aware
[3:34:04] foxy_grandpa9: i havent seen many annies. at least not in NA. what is making her ban worthy?
[3:34:16] WingedChipmunk: @foxy_grandpa9 memes
[3:34:19] eMbbuZomg: the fact that vlad last game is annie_irl
[3:34:22] MouldyCheesePie: Thoughts on Elise and Karth rn?
[3:34:24] eMbbuZomg: so he is in que
[3:34:29] eric440: lmao
[3:34:32] foxy_grandpa9: oh lol
[3:34:35] eric440: based
[3:34:46] MouldyCheesePie: What did the annie say to u?
[3:35:00] irelia80t: @Griefclaw imo, new season is about denying the solo carry and camping a lane, you have to full clear and be aware of any ward, can't brute force ganks anymore
[3:35:02] n33dl3z: play vi
[3:35:10] DJ_Photik: Amumu
[3:35:11] eMbbuZomg: jax
[3:35:16] milkweed_love: grag-ass

[3:36:12] justaguy1234566: Can u hear me?
[3:36:16] eMbbuZomg: enemy has exodia solo lanes again
[3:36:27] MouldyCheesePie: Ever tried Ksante jangle?
[3:36:28] Resadami: zac
[3:36:30] moosE3knucklE: super Skarnar
[3:36:33] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: for a second it looked like you were hovering Rammus and i was confused, but also really excited.
[3:36:36] criticwhospeaksfacts: @Santorin isn't noc good atm full clear, ulti can counter split push, strong dueler, can 1v1 any jgler early level too, good sustain in jg. can counter jungle, can flash gank lvl 3 with e.
[3:36:37] eric440: maokai huge rn
[3:36:39] GardenCrane: O SHT THE XIN ZHOU

[3:37:54] trashpanda_oz: TRUEEE
[3:37:56] DJ_Photik: How's Maokai jg u think @santorin or you like bruiser jgs instead of tank
[3:38:05] trashpanda_oz: OTPs should be required to hover their champs
[3:38:27] eMbbuZomg: OTP's dont want to hover cuz then they get sniped
[3:38:39] moosE3knucklE: oh its lathyrus on milio.
[3:38:40] eMbbuZomg: almost every game has a streamer xdd
[3:38:45] ddraggbagg: Annie Bot still plays?
[3:38:52] Sillstars: I would love to see a duo game with Gripex, 2 crazy danes on the rift!

[3:39:31] criticwhospeaksfacts: just cover minimap, no need for delay?
[3:39:44] eMbbuZomg: cover minimap as jungler
[3:39:46] eMbbuZomg: xdd
[3:39:46] moosE3knucklE: minimap cover is pointless for a jungler
[3:39:49] n33dl3z: streamers are paranoid about ghosting.
[3:40:10] criticwhospeaksfacts: why, if u cover minimap they can't see where laners are
[3:40:11] moosE3knucklE: you cover minimap as laner so that ghosters cant see where ur jungler is.
[3:40:33] MouldyCheesePie: he is the jungler xd
[3:40:47] criticwhospeaksfacts: doesnt matter it still prevents them froms eeing where mid is rotating or warding etc
[3:41:08] moosE3knucklE: laners are always in lane. if they roam its kinda obvious as the oppenent usually pings missing.
[3:41:44] criticwhospeaksfacts: yea then 1min delay i guess.
[3:41:45] lubemila: santorinFine
[3:42:22] eric440: lol nice

[4:10:36] Resadami: who is mf
[4:11:11] Foviack: @Santorin always so crazy how the best players run something different. I remember last season agurin was running electocute and ghost brand every game. but whos to say what is the best lol
[4:11:59] eMbbuZomg: do you like liandry or rylai first
[4:12:06] peslap: Is Brand more viable than Trundle in this meta?
[4:12:12] Ray701: narrator is always right
[4:12:14] moosE3knucklE: ghost on brand is great but when there is a pyke or blitz or something hook champ... flash is prolly better
[4:12:27] eMbbuZomg: best part of brand jg is going to grubs and chaining passive 3 times Kreygasm
[4:13:49] macywaky: hello santorinn
[4:13:49] HalfmanDaan: Why not ghost, or blue smite for movespeed?
[4:13:59] t1shock: why max q?
[4:15:19] macywaky: @Santorin try amumu jg? its seems qite strong
[4:15:21] HalfmanDaan: I would agree, but brand have so low movespeed
[4:15:45] Chaewon5: wait you are rank 7 all of NA?
[4:16:11] Jhodeib: soapy int
[4:16:23] eMbbuZomg: would be rank 1 in na
[4:16:52] Foviack: bro santorin hearing to play amumu jg in challenger hes gonna think youre so bad T_T
[4:17:27] moosE3knucklE: i told you
[4:17:38] eMbbuZomg: im more impressed by ur botlane
[4:18:03] moosE3knucklE: this guy is always going off in the games i see him in. Team Heretics got themselves a hell of a midlaner in the pipeline
[4:18:16] eMbbuZomg: he is academy mid or what?
[4:18:35] moosE3knucklE: @eMbbuZomg yeah Team Heretics acedemy
