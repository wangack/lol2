[0:23:08] zaltog: never seen a smolder be useful :,)
[0:23:34] thatsitpreme: riot devs have not been releasing their best champs, thats for sure
[0:23:59] atlafayon: i like hwei
[0:24:13] atlafayon: smolder is poopoo tho
[0:24:29] zaltog: game is basically over before smolder can be useful
[0:24:32] thatsitpreme: I do too, but hwei was a total flop when he dropped
[0:24:42] exileddc: yeah the buffed him so much
[0:24:46] exileddc: they will buff smolder too
[0:24:49] exileddc: then it will be op
[0:24:54] exileddc: they*
[0:25:21] atlafayon: @zaltog and even then theres a lot of counterplay with his miniscule range
[0:25:50] thatsitpreme: riot will find a way to make him incredibly broken, they always do
[0:26:09] zaltog: I doubt it but I guess we will find out
[0:26:22] atlafayon: until its broken in pro play, then hes getting nerfed to the ground

[0:33:36] siknastyyyy: appreciate the stream my guy
[0:33:57] lolhabby: he has 85% winrate with dirk rush.. how much more consistency do you want? XDDDD

[0:34:43] Flow56: Who is kumo
[0:34:45] nuky_999: @oueuee its just personal preference, obv its good else viper wouldn get 84%wr chall with it
[0:34:45] mayuki1604: yeah dirk into profane looks bad
[0:34:56] atlafayon: @lolhabby viper could probably rush rabadons on riven every game and still have 60%+ so idk
[0:35:07] nuky_999: nah its doable guys, you are saying its bad yet viper running chall games with it
[0:35:11] nuky_999: its just preference

[0:35:45] nuky_999: chinese rivens never went hydra eclipse last season why western rivens did it, doesnt mean its bad
[0:35:51] lolhabby: it’s high risk high reward which fits viper’s play style
[0:36:00] Amaresu_: @LAMF_BR your english is great man! :D
[0:36:01] lolhabby: he plays riven like a hypercarry full funnel
[0:36:07] Viper: <3
[0:36:11] Viper: its all preferance
[0:36:15] Viper: riven can have 10 diff builds
[0:36:23] Viper: just depends on what playstyle you wanna go for
[0:36:31] nuky_999: viper's riven is similiar to built, I can built going the same setup as viper why alois is more for safer and conssitent approach

[2:05:55] Mounizle: i asked rayan to pick irelia LUL
[2:06:09] RaafaaCasts: yeah it’s interesting how there are different cases for rookies that come up from acad into LCS: some don’t handle the stage nerves as well while others thrive under the bigger spotlight
[2:06:29] RaafaaCasts: sniper is the latter so far
[2:06:39] Mounizle: he's not shy in front of the camera like omran was either LUL

[2:16:59] Mounizle: really
[2:17:01] RaafaaCasts: the guess my rank ones?
[2:17:17] PrinceSwar: i liked the one they did a while back hot ones style
[2:17:24] PrinceSwar: that one was really cool and actually worth tuning into
[2:17:40] PrinceSwar: @RaafaaCasts i thikn it was the "are you toxic" one
[2:18:06] PrinceSwar: the other one was bad enough i already forgot it
[2:18:30] RaafaaCasts: yeah that was guess my rank
[2:18:57] RaafaaCasts: both the guess my rank and hot ones style videos were Dignitas internal content videos that we shared on their behalf
[2:19:00] PrinceSwar: content is hard tho i get that
[2:19:40] PrinceSwar: overall though this season has been the best one for lcs in a while
[2:19:46] PrinceSwar: last few years were DREADFUL
[2:20:46] RaafaaCasts: I thought 2021 was cool with the content lineup they had (replay files, mastermind, lane x lane, and the meteos sit down one)
[2:21:05] RaafaaCasts: but other years before then were not my favorite
[2:21:09] notlaff: janna xdd
[2:21:18] RaafaaCasts: 2020 was pretty hard tho since it was all remote

[2:48:48] fullmetalbruh: ya I think I should probably get decent with someone ranged for those situations
[2:48:49] Amaresu_: pick a mage and try them. orianna is like the staple mage of mid lane for 14 years
[2:49:01] fullmetalbruh: will try orianna
[2:49:06] Amaresu_: syndra does giga damage, can 1v9 carry, great champ really fun but gotta watch your positioning cause she doesnt have mobility
[2:49:20] Amaresu_: orianna will teach you midlane though
[2:49:21] fullmetalbruh: am definitely a fan of mobility
[2:49:28] fullmetalbruh: tried azur and got WREKT
[2:49:38] Amaresu_: if you like mobile champs there s azir :P he does everything a midlane mage needs to do but also has mobility xD
[2:49:45] Amaresu_: but he s hard to play, if you re new its not easy at all
[2:49:47] Amaresu_: syndra is easier
[2:49:47] soldierofnigtovia: Orianna 🤮 🤮 🤮 🤮
[2:49:53] fullmetalbruh: ya he azir hurt my brain lmao
[2:49:59] soldierofnigtovia: Syndra 🤮 🤮 🤮 🤮
[2:50:02] Amaresu_: its not for new players yeah :P
[2:50:08] Amaresu_: he plays more like an adc, azir.
[2:50:26] Amaresu_: but when you get really good at him you can go for plays where you dash in and ult enemies into your team at the right moment etc
[2:50:29] Amaresu_: so you can engage with him as well
[2:50:32] Amaresu_: he s really unique
[2:50:59] ackihuru: i think azir very otp champ no?
[2:51:09] fullmetalbruh: how about ahri mid?
[2:51:16] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh yeah she s pretty safe mid champ
[2:51:21] Amaresu_: gotta land your e and q though
[2:51:25] fullmetalbruh: will try those E today
[2:51:27] Amaresu_: mostly your E, if you alnd e you combo q np
[2:51:29] fullmetalbruh: 3*
[2:51:38] Amaresu_: i think try ori syndra ahri for starters
[2:51:40] Amaresu_: see what you like
[2:51:43] Nightbot: Sub to the stream if you want to see me stream everyday and to support my journey of full time streaming! Thank you and enjoy
[2:52:04] Amaresu_: and for melee champs you can keep your irelia + sylas/akali down the line
[2:52:08] Amaresu_: these champs dont go away from the meta
[2:52:14] soldierofnigtovia: @Amaresu_ sending someone the dark path of the most annoying mid lane champs xdd
[2:52:26] Amaresu_: i d suggest zed and leblanc but these champs are weak af often sadly
[2:52:37] Amaresu_: @soldierofnigtovia i mean if he wants to learn mid hee has to learn them tho
[2:52:48] Amaresu_: they re annoying to play against but they re fun to play
[2:53:01] fullmetalbruh: I feel like aKali is  crazy weak or I just always play bad ones
[2:53:08] Amaresu_: nah the problem is
[2:53:13] Amaresu_: you have to learn to pick up your Q
[2:53:16] Amaresu_: and use your passive
[2:53:19] Amaresu_: to utilize her well
[2:53:22] Amaresu_: and not miss E
[2:53:33] fullmetalbruh: I haven’t played aKali personally but anytime I lane against her it feels free
[2:53:36] Amaresu_: and then once you have items you can oneshot ppl
[2:53:44] Amaresu_: yeah i mean you play vs other new players prob
[2:53:46] Amaresu_: and she s not easy
[2:53:49] VietSteak: no assist wtf, even though spear stax was on
[2:53:51] Amaresu_: so they prob dont know what they re doing :P
[2:53:53] Gizan: How no assist
[2:53:56] later00in00life: ^^
[2:54:00] fullmetalbruh: ya seems like another complex character
[2:54:03] later00in00life: would have made the gold diff too
[2:54:08] Zodiac_Walker: Lots of the champs mentioned here are very unforgiving, basically if you miss an ability, chances that ur not getting much out of it is pretty big
[2:54:13] Zodiac_Walker: High skill ceiling
[2:54:20] fullmetalbruh: right
[2:54:23] Amaresu_: yeah champs like akali, zed, leblanc, azir, you need to learn the game first and have good mechanics to make them work
[2:54:29] Amaresu_: i could do the old advice
[2:54:32] Amaresu_: just play annie to learn the game
[2:54:38] Amaresu_: its actually good advice but the champ is giga boring
[2:54:39] fullmetalbruh: oh ya zed looks cool but also lil complicated maybe
[2:54:42] Amaresu_: and might make you not like the game
[2:54:48] fullmetalbruh: ya Annie crazy sleeper but I lane against her a lot
[2:54:51] Amaresu_: zed is the best designed champ in the game for me
[2:54:55] Amaresu_: and he s like 11 years old
[2:55:00] Amaresu_: most fun ..
[2:55:03] Amaresu_: nothing beats him for me
[2:55:09] andyman8888: why is Kalista so good now? did she get buffed?
[2:55:12] fullmetalbruh: haven’t tried but looks fun.
[2:55:14] Amaresu_: even tho he s been bad for many years
[2:55:25] Amaresu_: @andyman8888 she s been good since worlds patch last ssn
[2:55:29] PureWaterA: @Amaresu_ Old Irelia for me. New irelia is also nice, but stomps lower elos.
[2:55:34] fullmetalbruh: is teemo good both top and mid or am I just seeing him mid cause I’m playing other new players
[2:55:37] Zodiac_Walker: Zed is pretty fun and rewarding, all tho a bit difficult to keep track on ur shadows- but ofc;  most important beyond all is that its something u enjoy playing
[2:55:40] Amaresu_: @andyman8888 lane domination picks are good botlane w/ ranged supports caue you guarantee dragons
[2:55:43] andyman8888: @amaresu_ oh I see
[2:55:55] Zodiac_Walker: Teemo can go both mid and top, the reason why he's often prefered top is because he does good into melee matchups
[2:55:55] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh he s a top champ
[2:55:58] itsov3rlord: xddddd
[2:56:05] fullmetalbruh: I thought so lol
[2:56:15] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh just really curious btw how did you find viper if you re new to the game?
[2:56:18] VietSteak: @Zodiac_Walker fuck teemo and anybody who plays that
[2:56:21] fullmetalbruh: ya I hate teemo top lmao
[2:56:29] andyman8888: I went against a Kalista mid yesterday and it was very annoying. hadn’t run into one before haha
[2:56:34] Zodiac_Walker: Ahahahah yeah, he has reputation for being one of the most BS champs in the game
[2:56:35] Nightbot: Subscribe to my YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbhTDvxYDkkhDDZG6PGSV3A Follow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/hiitsviper tiktok : https://www.tiktok.com/@viper_riven
[2:56:52] fullmetalbruh: bro poison chips half my health under my tower every game
[2:56:58] Amaresu_: xD
[2:57:05] Amaresu_: new player experience vs teemo ig
[2:57:13] fullmetalbruh: ya man lmao
[2:57:20] Amaresu_: but he s also good vs irelia cause of the blind, once you re really good at irelia though you farm him eventually
[2:57:23] Amaresu_: especially at 6 onwards
[2:57:24] PureWaterA: am i carzy or did kalistas model move foward a tad to master yi?
[2:57:44] PureWaterA: @Amaresu_ Irelia counters teemo. Irelia main here
[2:57:46] Amaresu_: blind = teemo Q, makes your autoattacks miss aka not do dmg for a few seconds
[2:57:48] eternalkniight: gragas top zzz
[2:57:50] Zodiac_Walker: Kalista's passive let's her leap a small distance for each auto
[2:57:50] Amaresu_: @PureWaterA ik
[2:58:01] Amaresu_: @PureWaterA just telling him cause he s new to the game hem ight not know what teemo q does.
[2:58:20] Amaresu_: irelia farms all ranged champs especially post 6
[2:58:30] PureWaterA: i havent played league in like 4 months, but if i remember correctly teemo blind doesnt work on irelia Q, so if u hit an E its gg
[2:58:31] Amaresu_: as long as you land your shit :P
[2:58:34] PureWaterA: and at lvl 6 he ints u
[2:58:43] Amaresu_: @PureWaterA yeah but it fucks your autos
[2:58:50] Zodiac_Walker: Irelia's Q isn't an auto so yeah, that'd make sense
[2:58:51] PureWaterA: dont need autos if u full combo him
[2:58:52] Amaresu_: which is irelias entire point with her passive
[2:58:57] Amaresu_: @PureWaterA GIGACHAD
[2:59:11] fullmetalbruh: wtf I actually didn’t know that lmao
[2:59:15] VietSteak: 0/6 Gwen LMFAO
[2:59:16] fullmetalbruh: damn I hate teemo
[2:59:21] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh there s so much to learn about this game
[2:59:32] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh most of us started playing in season 3 with like idk sub 100 champs
[2:59:37] Amaresu_: now there s like 200 or something
[2:59:43] fullmetalbruh: ya champ knowledge is so big
[2:59:43] PureWaterA: Half the time irelias lose its from lack of self control. Irelias still dashing when facing Vex w/ all CDs triggers me so bad
[2:59:44] Amaresu_: and the last 3-4 years' ones are so bs
[2:59:48] Lugury: !song
[2:59:52] Nightbot: ▶️ Diarent - "Eternity" -> open.spotify.com/track/4h3jOqcdzbp8pM4ZkA3Apd
[2:59:55] Amaresu_: its rly hard for new players now but just play what you find fun
[2:59:57] Amaresu_: try everything
[3:00:01] Amaresu_: play the free champ rotation champs
[3:00:05] Amaresu_: and find what you like
[3:00:08] Amaresu_: both in terms of roles and champs
[3:00:17] PureWaterA: They need a leauge classic. I'd play the shit out of that.
[3:00:24] Amaresu_: ^
[3:00:24] VietSteak: 0/6 gwen killing gragas KEKW
[3:00:26] Amaresu_: amen to that brother
[3:00:32] Amaresu_: give me season 3 zed/riven/leblanc/fizz again
[3:00:40] PureWaterA: All old champs before reworks as well. more slowpaced. back to dumb fun builds and duo tops
[3:00:42] fullmetalbruh: I just to only play riven too when I very first joined league. not very viable tho
[3:00:42] Amaresu_: with dfg and old brut old lw old bt old yomous old cleaver old bork
[3:00:45] PureWaterA: all damage from champs not items
[3:00:48] fullmetalbruh: top*
[3:00:51] ackihuru: yea and for new player bro just mute ppl who get on your nerves, there's nothing to gain from arguing with trolls on the game
[3:00:58] Zodiac_Walker: There was actually a project that was named Chronoshift that was supposed to be released, and was basically meant to be around Season 5, 6
[3:00:59] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh yeah she s one of the ... way harder champs :P
[3:01:02] fullmetalbruh: didn’t know any other roles or legends which just got me killed in the long run
[3:01:03] Zodiac_Walker: But it got cancelled, unfortunately
[3:01:06] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh its impossible to learn the game while also learning riven
[3:01:20] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh riven requires you to focus on your mechanics which takes away from your map awareness when you re new
[3:01:29] fullmetalbruh: ya it feels like a totally different game sometimes only playing riven top
[3:01:33] Amaresu_: first learn the game on easier champs and then you can learn champs like riven or azir etc
[3:01:33] fullmetalbruh: ya 100%
[3:01:40] Amaresu_: oh yeah
[3:01:42] ackihuru: as they say you need to learn the FUNDAMENTALS
[3:01:45] Amaresu_: riven is very snowbally and can 1v9
[3:01:59] Amaresu_: but she s extremely hard to play well and you have to play really well or you fall extremely behind
[3:02:04] Amaresu_: cause she s full physical
[3:02:07] Amaresu_: so any armor fucks you
[3:02:15] Amaresu_: she has no magic or true or mixed dmg or penetration in her kit
[3:02:23] fullmetalbruh: ya absolutely. feels stronk but I die a lot to like sett or jaxx cause I didn’t know their abilities
[3:02:36] fullmetalbruh: would sit there and try and combo jax to get giga stunned
[3:02:43] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh if you wanna learn toplane go follow aloisnl on twitch/youtube and watch his content. you ll learn all the fundamentals of toplane
[3:02:53] ackihuru: FANTAMENTOS
[3:02:58] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh her damage comes from her passive not her abilities
[3:03:13] Amaresu_: @fullmetalbruh so you want to autoattack inbetween every Q cast or .. any ability cast really
[3:03:52] Amaresu_: but to do that you have to learn the "fast q" combo where you cancel your auto by clicking the ground inbetween so.. it takes practice. and then you can cancel some of her animations, primarily her ult so you can do the really fast combos where you see viper oneshot ppl etc.
[3:04:15] DaDaggerFace: how do renatas and kalistas auto attack passives interact?
[3:04:20] Amaresu_: but good for you is today we have practice tool, back in my day there was no practice tool. you had to go into custom game and try over and over with cooldowns on jungle camps xD
[3:04:42] Amaresu_: but how do they not ff btw
[3:04:45] Mounizle: kalista w passive enhances supp autos

[4:08:02] astro___wolf: @altroud ik your joking but i feel like vayve is a champ that cant play safe in lane bacuse if your behind your useless imo
[4:08:03] ackihuru: we the coldwons
[4:08:19] ackihuru: never hot
[4:09:06] ackihuru: atleast in toplane mostly does not make sense to play overly passive since u win most matchups eyes closed
[4:09:17] ackihuru: if jg even touches top you snowball hard
[4:09:45] HonestAbe__: @astro___wolf she's allowed to farm up and scale and she's super squishy so making sure you know when to play safe vs agressive is super important on vayne/ranged top in general
[4:10:12] ackihuru: very tru
[4:10:28] masoku322: lmao urgot
[4:10:34] masoku322: with the dge of night
[4:10:37] astro___wolf: @HonestAbe__ true
[4:10:38] masoku322: edge
[4:10:45] Lugury: this urgot is .... edgy
[4:10:51] HonestAbe__: is it ever worth to just insta E him when he comes to lane and keep ur distance until its back up
[4:10:59] HonestAbe__: for edge of night
[4:11:05] AntcliffLIVE: @HonestAbe__ yes
[4:11:09] masoku322: yes<
[4:11:20] Lexwastaaken: why did he build that item for first
[4:11:28] AntcliffLIVE: cause it eats condemn
[4:11:31] masoku322: @Lexwastaaken so vayne can nvr condemn him
[4:11:41] HonestAbe__: and does it give a lil health or am i a piggy
[4:11:51] AntcliffLIVE: so if urgot has flash ignite ult he can jump on vayne and she has no way to condemn him
[4:11:58] AntcliffLIVE: @HonestAbe__ 300hp i think
[4:12:25] TacoTimeAllTheTime: ??
