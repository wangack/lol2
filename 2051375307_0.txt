[0:47:35] Whale_stream: It turned out yikers.
[0:48:18] Whale_stream: Streamers leveraging their star power to save money yeaaah.
[0:48:30] BobberWCC: Many people did them without any bad intentions before people caught onto it being a bad thing.
[0:48:55] BobberWCC: NODDERS
[0:48:58] AutumnReds: i think the one bahroo did was typically well received.
[0:48:58] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[0:48:59] PoorMansPoison: I think you could only do that internalyl
[0:49:02] PoorMansPoison: internally*
[0:49:07] PoorMansPoison: like within the discord
[0:49:07] crabemporer: Just pay them in exposure xdd
[0:49:18] Whale_stream: Simply host gartic phone with art friends and make your prompt your character
[0:49:20] Whale_stream: ✨
[0:49:24] Grognog: I mean, surely the kye point is stressing that there can only be X amount of winners so do it at your own discretion
[0:49:29] zombierecon: Do sign-ups, with a set amount of applicant spots
[0:49:38] CompulsiveOne: it does have to be through the discord or very stealthy on twitter
[0:49:38] Com_turtle: could always ask crumpet about it, his contests seem to work well as far as I can tell
[0:49:40] BobberWCC: Just collect art pokemon like strippin and one day youll have your army
[0:49:45] Blight3108: If the artists that submit decide among themselves who wins, is that better?
[0:49:52] FibBortuna: Looking
[0:49:58] Albromyle: LOL
[0:49:59] SmallBrain09: It's touchy, you'd need to make it worth it without money. Maybe a place for all the submission with links to the artist
[0:50:01] BobberWCC: LOL
[0:50:01] Oglino: OMEGALUL
[0:50:02] Albromyle: oh brother

[0:50:07] PoorMansPoison: HAHAHA
[0:50:08] JamesXLR8: Pet? Susge
[0:50:12] MyGamingInGeneral: i think its called being a patron, or it was back in teh day haha
[0:50:12] ToutedDjinn: an artist to shove in the basement like sam does manda NODDERS
[0:50:15] JTCodeName: Yea I submitted to Robs early art contest things and it just became something I do for fun since there are so many artist out there that are better
[0:50:20] Good_Old_Heretic: @Lawlman That is called sponsoring someone, not a pet lmao
[0:50:23] PoorMansPoison: he wants to be an art patron
[0:50:23] TinyLeviathyn: yeah, what’s a pet artist?

[0:50:39] JoePatzilla: Rule: can't vote for yourself ?
[0:50:40] Whale_stream: Oh, to be a Renaissance era artist with a rich patron funding my creativity
[0:50:41] CompulsiveOne: we arent a democracy here Madge
[0:50:42] RobbedGamer: We need more people to just adopt artists and say "Here's a salary go nuts"
[0:50:49] Grognog: Groups could easily rig it
[0:50:50] Albromyle: I feel like every response to this art competition is "Good luck" LUL
[0:50:54] Albromyle: hard to get right
[0:50:59] Grognog: Friend groups
[0:51:12] Grognog: If money is involved, it just happens
[0:51:14] DirtyPotato: good luck
[0:51:16] DirtyPotato: EZ
[0:51:40] JoePatzilla: Could test run it, rewards are  subs ?
[0:51:56] ToutedDjinn: artists do hate him Sadge
[0:51:58] Darchon_: learn to draw :)
[0:52:00] Grognog: I did like the angle of having a place to link and promote all the artists
[0:52:05] AutumnReds: you've had bad luck with artists?
[0:52:08] Grognog: That's at least good ol' exposure
[0:52:14] SmallBrain09: Community vote for top 3. The. You choose the best. So it's not on you
[0:52:18] CompulsiveOne: @AutumnReds all the time Sadge

[0:52:30] Syllable_: Looking
[0:52:34] Whale_stream: Some of my buddies find pretty good, consistent, and extremely cheap artists on places like skeb. International seems to be the trick but sometimes you get ghosted

[0:52:37] Oglino: Looking
[0:52:37] TinyTimbo456: You're a solid dude

[0:54:02] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq
[0:54:03] Grognog: Seems like the type of thing to start off with then go specific after you have designs you like. Expensive brainstorming essentially
[0:54:03] JTCodeName: Fiverr as well. but you know probably not that different from skeb by the sounds of it
[0:54:08] Whale_stream: "hello artist. I would like to see boobs that have never been seen before."
