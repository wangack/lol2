[0:47:21] Vagilante: I can honestly say you are correct, experienced this. Buy whatever you want but.....the people you want to share it with weren't there. $$ does not = happy
[0:47:46] suupaaah: Honestly this seems like a big issue I would talk to like a therapist or something
[0:47:48] Twisted_Rider: Desi your a good soul
[0:48:06] CallMeFritho: Happiness is not all about money it’s a lot of factors in life. Money IS one of them, but also love (and the absence of it), loneliness, stress levels, work situations and tons more.

[0:53:03] CallMeFritho: @suupaaah Many people don’t want to hear this but that’s because life is about suffering. I mean this in positive way.
[0:53:57] Beefbrick: My therapist told me its not about happiness. Its about being content with life.
[0:53:57] cubbie3890: Drinking Henny

[1:07:57] Zefior: fuegoYay
[1:08:09] gabbigjee97: If you have ads and that stuff you do
[1:08:09] DesiHeat: fuegoYay
[1:08:15] siggysudzz: fuegoYay
[1:08:18] Renfuryy: fuegoYay  󠀀
[1:08:24] xxpoohdaddyxx: fuegoYay
[1:08:52] Zolshy89: have you seen how much Twitch spams ads tho? Lol
[1:08:59] Zolshy89: If you are not subbed its miserable
[1:09:12] Zefior: subs are probably a more predictable source of income Hmmm
[1:09:14] CallMeFritho: Am I no audience sad
[1:09:20] Renfuryy: yeah but your view is only worth a couple cents to an advertiser keking
[1:09:21] gabbigjee97: Yeah fuegoYay fuegoH be yourself and let subs support carry you forward
[1:09:49] CallMeFritho: I’m kidding BillyApprove KEKG
[1:09:54] pinatairl: ARGYLE ARGYLE
[1:10:02] treviheat: ALSO
[1:10:24] Beefbrick: Just push content out dont worry about the metrics. You get there. I watched because your hardcore wow was fun. Just keep doing you, dont worry about count.
[1:10:27] Twisted_Rider: OCD
[1:10:45] killgore25: Desi you are pretty freakin unique
[1:10:45] Beefbrick: I also failed as a streamer. I get it.
[1:11:11] Beefbrick: You'll make it! just keep going!
[1:11:11] hauserdot: RuneScape gonna be tough to enjoy unless desi played back then for the nostalgia in oldschool. It’s a good game, but i don’t think the game is getting many new players. glad your gonna play it though for sure
[1:11:24] siggysudzz: Feels bad when u have 1 viewer but u know that one viewer Is you watching yourself on your second monitor to make sure your streams still working
[1:11:26] siggysudzz: fuegoKek
[1:11:33] vakkas424: Id gift a sub but they are 2.5 times more expensive on the phone
[1:11:34] Renfuryy: siggy keking
[1:11:45] Beefbrick: I used to stream to 5-10 it was fucked
[1:11:57] Twisted_Rider: your going to like me or not
[1:11:58] Renfuryy: @vakkas424 use your mobile browser and force it into desktop mode, it will be normal price. the markup is the app store not twitch
[1:12:06] Zefior: @hauserdot do you think with runelite it would be better? its similar to classic wow, you kinda need addons for the game to be good Hmmm
[1:12:10] TomCat: it can be scary AF
[1:12:27] Deisolx: Good evening!
[1:12:38] Twisted_Rider: when u get older it makes more sense
[1:12:39] FL3XingtonSteele: I am sorry if it takes away from "you time"
[1:12:53] Zolshy89: I mean these things fluctuate, but it was not Random, Just gotta rebuild Desi fuegoGaming fuegoGaming fuegoGaming fuegoGaming fuegoGaming
[1:12:54] CallMeFritho: Honestly streaming isn’t the only ‘job’ that gives these feelings and/or thoughts.
[1:13:27] Beefbrick: Youtube/instagram/ticktock you have to do it.
[1:13:31] hauserdot: @zefior yeah ofc runelite is great. with 117 the built in add ons/ features are great
[1:13:33] Brother17_: more lux, huh? GIGACHAD
[1:13:51] Beefbrick: I dont wanna piss you off sorry
[1:14:09] TomCat: figure out how to address the anxiety and often times depression will go away. it's a side effect of anxiety
[1:14:13] cookietime95: yeah cookie cutter
[1:14:17] vakkas424: How do I do that?
[1:14:20] Beefbrick: Its just twitch is shit for discoverability.
[1:14:35] hauserdot: @zefior that’s a good comparison honestly. playing in the vanilla client would be more akin to playing with no add ons in wow
[1:14:39] Level_1_God: woah wtf, osrs tm??
[1:14:43] CallMeFritho: Well it’s a part of making a living off of this kind of job isn’t it?
[1:14:43] Renfuryy: you dont need to be discovered as an established streamer, those guidelines are for people with 3 viewers
[1:14:55] gabbigjee97: Good goal

If you have one make sure to turn it upside down for one day every year, and replace / recharge it every 6 years. This has been ChairmanofGaming keeping it real. Real safe.
