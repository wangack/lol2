[3:07:13] P3peKEKW: yeah
[3:07:30] P3peKEKW: try essence,manamune,navori,cdr boots
[3:08:24] InfiniteKore: Oh wow, Fleet Footwork is his highest winrate keystone by a mile
[3:08:59] Kynshassa: he honestly needs the ms early game
[3:09:35] Asmmodeus: !rank
[3:09:35] StreamElements: https://na.op.gg/summoners/na/horsey
[3:09:47] EnderOCE: Wait if smolder uses E he can see talon in his R?
[3:10:25] InfiniteKore: Shojin also apparently has a high WR on him, which is hilarious
[3:11:23] Kynshassa: itll be interesting to see if builds take him more AP or AD later on
[3:11:30] StreamElements: Check out my latest YT video like and comment pretty plz! daysWave daysLove https://youtu.be/RCmiik-iJ0c daysSaber
[3:11:48] InfiniteKore: He doesn't have enough AP scalings

[3:12:26] InfiniteKore: his Q is 15%, W at 65% and his ult at 100%
[3:13:02] Kynshassa: Ive seen a couple build AP mostly for the haste and do well
[3:13:24] Kynshassa: Mind you I also saw a heartsteel support smolder that was the most annoying little shit ever
[3:13:56] InfiniteKore: Sure, but by that virtue you can build ability haste AD and do better imho
[3:13:56] EnderOCE: Your video was in there
[3:14:10] EnderOCE: Your smolder one
[3:14:20] Visions_Of_V_: they cut out the scream tho :(
[3:14:45] uma_: I just woke up and it's 12 am lol
[3:15:17] InfiniteKore: Shojin is 35, Navori is great, Trinity is 15
[3:15:38] uma_: Guess I'm not sleeping anymore
[3:15:40] InfiniteKore: Shojin Essence/Trinityis 55/50 already
[3:16:01] Kynshassa: True, maybe its just my experience but he doesnt seem to be doing well
[3:16:12] InfiniteKore: Almost no champion does well when they launch
[3:16:15] Kynshassa: dont know if its just players not knowing him or if hes just not tuned right
[3:16:15] Spamxsandwich: horsey
[3:16:18] Spamxsandwich: just
[3:16:21] Spamxsandwich: 5second
[3:16:26] InfiniteKore: with MUCH better AD scaling, I can't see AP being the call
[3:16:30] StreamElements: Check out my latest YT video like and comment pretty plz! daysWave daysLove https://youtu.be/RCmiik-iJ0c daysSaber
[3:16:35] InfiniteKore: Its almost always a build or playstyle thiong
[3:16:58] Kynshassa: I dont think people know how to use his E yet imo
[3:17:05] InfiniteKore: I think a Fleet Footwork CDR build is likely the path, at least from the numbers I'm seeing
[3:17:10] EnderOCE: Horsey the GOAT
[3:17:33] Spamxsandwich: just peep the content
