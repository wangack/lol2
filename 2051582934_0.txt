[1:06:20] tinyangrycrab: thiccmo
[1:08:12] tinyangrycrab: that's a pretty jumpy team, kaisa talon camille aatrox galio hard to be squishy into that
[1:09:10] tinyangrycrab: enemy team is also full mr stacking which is not normal no
[1:09:16] TheGoodGoons: at this point in the game dark harvest teemo can turn the tides of battle. the build he is going? not rly @ipav999
[1:10:22] tinyangrycrab: oh i mean it's not stupid for them i just mean that if you're fed teemo on an ap heavy team it feels like you're likely to feel ineffective because enemy team will efficiently itemise against you
[1:10:51] tinyangrycrab: just unlucky team comp from that pov
[1:11:39] tinyangrycrab: misuFeels poor fappy

[1:16:19] gvidasek: Hello Ivan! How you doing?
[1:16:35] tinyangrycrab: did well in laning phase then had to wait for his team to get their shit together and enemy team to kinda fall apart felt like
[1:17:06] tinyangrycrab: sometimes its just a team diff
[1:18:08] Kristyyy____: that akali kill was gangsta
[1:18:52] tinyangrycrab: maybe he thinks that he can just run her down early or something
