[3:01:07] ejhavok: so why did riot remove the debuff icon for reduced gold status. I swear they took away a bunch of information for no reason this season

[3:07:44] bladetrinity16: just dont release the key too soon
[3:08:10] adnips: right of course
[3:08:12] Tricking9: 5Head
[3:08:15] criticwhospeaksfacts: so how do you adjust the length, sometimes it creates short tunnels, other times large tunnels, other times the tunnel length doesn't show. makes no sense
[3:08:38] bladetrinity16: its based off the terrain, but you just have to learn the places where it goes long
[3:08:56] adnips: that qiyana ult would have stunned me

[3:12:04] archimedes_9: zeri is good tho
[3:12:21] bladetrinity16: i much rather face yuumi than zeri
[3:12:25] criticwhospeaksfacts: yea riot messed up creating Yuumi. Once they create a champ they can never delete it or else they get hate. So they kept reworking Yuumi to balance her and now she is so weak and unplayable they rather keep her there then be op until they figure a long term rework
[3:13:05] MysticSmash: this company also made braum
[3:13:07] MysticSmash: aka the goat
[3:13:08] bladetrinity16: and some are good at trolling
[3:13:12] Deku_Dreaming: i can appreciate the intention behind yuumi even if in practise it sucked
[3:13:20] BeachBoi: Yuumis already had a rework don't forget

[3:14:03] bladetrinity16: @BeachBoi you mean e? cause w has always been her hop on someone else button
[3:14:09] criticwhospeaksfacts: imagine releasing the old yuumi in this patch.
[3:14:12] bladetrinity16: e used to heal not shield
[3:14:51] BeachBoi: Ah E too then. Cause W used to give ap/ad not healing on hit.
[3:14:51] ChromaKhroma: recalling right next to a chime 😐
[3:15:13] bladetrinity16: ah that part
[3:15:15] skever24: Clueless
[3:15:15] BeachBoi: Your adc used to get like 100ad with a late game yuumi
[3:15:22] bladetrinity16: i believe the healing on hit is now her passive not w
[3:15:23] adnips: give yuumi her CC blocking back
[3:15:29] BaneBladeV: KEKW not wrong
[3:15:36] BeachBoi: No it's on her W
[3:15:40] archimedes_9: give yuumi 2 charges on E back
[3:15:48] BeachBoi: Her passive is the heal on Q or auto I think
[3:15:52] jannablowsu: bard the type of champ where the harder you try the more likely you lose
[3:15:56] BaneBladeV: stuntNoted run in circles, troll, win

[6:01:15] bladetrinity16: it really does though
[6:01:28] icehat_702: why do you have health regen?
[6:01:29] denunciator: i've been trying to sell briar supp to you since week 1 SAJ
[6:01:29] TwitchTime89: maybe because you are?
[6:01:31] PROFESSORLABCOAT: hail of blades W is sicko mode damage

[6:01:54] bladetrinity16: she kinda nuts on the damage front
[6:01:57] adnips: Wait until you get some lethality
[6:01:59] denunciator: wait until you get lethality items holy
[6:02:00] denunciator: yeah
[6:02:11] Reckfuls: it’s a statcheck champ so as support it’s going to be weird
[6:02:15] denunciator: Erm
[6:02:24] Ghostloon: so how did the other games (ASol) go today
[6:02:33] zionthegod: are the game sounds really low? or it just my stream messed up

[6:03:07] TwitchTime89: @zionthegod they're pretty low compared to the music
[6:03:08] icehat_702: you can flash to change targets during w
[6:03:14] denunciator: i would've gone boots instead of long sword
[6:03:17] denunciator: to make W a lil better
[6:03:24] bladetrinity16: even though your belveth inted it early, your varus is nutty
[6:03:45] onlyskell: Did i see ap varus
[6:03:47] granolasoul: is lethality still the play after her nerfs?
[6:03:47] zionthegod: @twitchtime89 oh ok.
[6:03:52] denunciator: honestly in low elo briar is limitless, but you cant blind it cause they grab like Leona and you get a seizure

[6:04:03] PoroPatty: i think brusier is better but idk about support
[6:04:12] PROFESSORLABCOAT: i read that lethality and bruiser builds are kind of even now in winrate
[6:04:41] Hydr_OH: wait stunt, do you have a hwei item screenshot or something?
[6:04:42] onlyskell: @bladetrinity16 mb lmao i thought i saw blasting wand instead of berserkers
[6:04:43] SmolSylveon: i thought bruiser but idk
[6:04:47] criticwhospeaksfacts: chat should  i order bubble tea via ubereats and pay $17 or should I just save my money even though I can afford it
[6:04:55] denunciator: you should save money
[6:04:59] bladetrinity16: @onlyskell you made me double check when he pressed tab xD
[6:05:09] Hydr_OH: relly horizon cryptbloom, got it
[6:05:15] catfish020: @criticwhospeaksfacts depends on if bubble tea is able to make you happier than $17 in the bank
[6:05:15] criticwhospeaksfacts: that's not the answer i wanted :( where's the support
[6:05:17] Hydr_OH: I run seraphs, shurelya mandate
[6:05:26] denunciator: yes
[6:05:30] criticwhospeaksfacts: yea money doesn't make me happy, food does
[6:05:32] denunciator: it's like bla dimir E
[6:05:37] Hydr_OH: @criticwhospeaksfacts honestly, save the money, could probably get a good meal if anything
[6:05:38] jjennukka: @criticwhospeaksfacts If you can afford it you should get it geefPOG
[6:05:40] granolasoul: Ifeel like triforce is prob good on her right?
[6:05:42] bladetrinity16: bla
[6:05:44] zionthegod: @stunt can you turn the game sounds up a teensy bit please stuntLove
[6:05:47] samminea: wait till it goes on sale and get two bobas

[6:06:07] bladetrinity16: he lived that
[6:06:07] criticwhospeaksfacts: but if i drive, it will take 10min to go to shops, wait 5min in line, 10 mins to come back.
[6:06:17] denunciator: KEKW
[6:06:18] bladetrinity16: smolder didnt though
[6:06:23] denunciator: fun champ isnt she
[6:06:41] denunciator: mercs
[6:06:46] denunciator: just kidding, swifties
[6:06:48] adnips: None so we can see her feet still
[6:07:04] Hydr_OH: bard got a fleet proc + a W i think
[6:07:06] Suzakus: Erm
[6:07:17] RickyTheRainFrog: suza Gladge
[6:07:21] Suzakus: @RickyTheRainFrog Gladge
[6:07:27] criticwhospeaksfacts: they should make it that every item you buy literally gets added onto the champion's skin. so if someone buys 5 boots, there's 5 boots showing. thoughts?
[6:07:35] bladetrinity16: @denunciator guma was up 2k over the nearest opponent before plates even dropped...
[6:07:44] denunciator: cait is cait
[6:07:48] archimedes_9: @criticwhospeaksfacts like risk of rain 2 lol

[6:08:05] arnedconinck: What do you think of pantheon support?
[6:08:06] adnips: Where TF does poppy keep coming from
[6:08:07] RickyTheRainFrog: archi Gladge
[6:08:20] bladetrinity16: 2.5k gold lead bot lane alone at 7:30
[6:08:21] bladetrinity16: thats gross
[6:08:30] denunciator: i max Q because Q has resist shred on it
[6:08:38] adnips: Your ult makes a global noise btw
[6:09:14] denunciator: dont forget W2 and E channel both heal you
[6:09:15] Hydr_OH: ult also has a visual indicator on which champs it might hit, noticed it recently
[6:09:34] OmegaMonsoon: @Hydr_OH really? ive never noticed
[6:09:54] razberry10: varus ult followed by your ult would be wild
[6:10:03] denunciator: W has a small dash on it (~300 range) so poppy will kniock you up
[6:10:07] bladetrinity16: poppy just living bot
[6:10:16] denunciator: Learning
[6:10:34] Hydr_OH: @Hydr_OH there's small grey circles underneath, in a game i had enemy briar ult top, but nothing showed up bot. when she ulted bot, my sivir and i got a grey circle under us
[6:10:49] adnips: Interesting
[6:10:49] cdrs: unlucky
[6:10:58] denunciator: R has an AoE fear on things that's not your target
[6:11:09] bladetrinity16: ^
[6:11:17] bladetrinity16: that bard ult would have been great to R
[6:11:52] reformedJay: Vibe
[6:12:04] bladetrinity16: if you dont use E to cancel it
[6:12:08] AntharasSunrise: you can cancel it with the E
[6:12:08] bladetrinity16: you will go until you or your target dies
[6:12:15] denunciator: forever
[6:12:17] denunciator: literally
[6:12:22] adnips: Unless you E
[6:12:32] adnips: Oh wait the ult
[6:12:37] adnips: Isn't cancelable
[6:12:39] bladetrinity16: ult can be cancelled with E
[6:12:56] criticwhospeaksfacts: oh boy i hope you win this, i hate briar, dont want to see another 3 briar games ResidentSleeper
[6:13:03] adnips: Oh doubted myself for some reason
[6:13:28] denunciator: oh btw E functions like Qiyana R - knocking them into terrain knocks them up!!
[6:13:36] bladetrinity16: and stuns for 1.5 seconds!
[6:13:40] denunciator: and then stun after, like Gnar R
[6:13:42] icehat_702: also bonus damage
[6:13:44] denunciator: this champ just has too many mechanics
[6:13:44] mo0nx: hmm this may be the one champ I'd probably not play as a support like ever xD
[6:13:45] denunciator: LMAO
[6:13:51] granolasoul: I think triforce and a bruisery build is the play unless team comp really lacks damage or enemy team really squishy
[6:13:56] denunciator: yeah Q has 20% resist shred on it, it's really strong
[6:14:03] archimedes_9: 3/10/2 - not even that bad
[6:14:05] criticwhospeaksfacts: riot needs to delete briar, worse than yuumi
[6:14:12] archimedes_9: i love your optimism
[6:15:04] adnips: We need an Anivia it's the only way
[6:15:10] denunciator: 3/10 vs adc still no problem
[6:15:45] best_eboy_na: nono
[6:15:51] TwitchTime89: danse

[6:18:36] criticwhospeaksfacts: fomo
[6:18:51] bladetrinity16: its pretty joever
[6:19:02] granolasoul: i think w heals more the lower your ap
[6:19:14] bladetrinity16: hp
[6:19:16] Suzakus: hp nog ap
[6:19:17] PROFESSORLABCOAT: OBVIOUSLY because stormsurge is good against gp and poppy
[6:19:17] granolasoul: hp
[6:19:22] PROFESSORLABCOAT: the game knows these things
[6:19:24] granolasoul: mb
[6:20:14] adnips: The good against feature is my favourite thing ever like it's never right
[6:20:47] Ali3va: opinion about smolder atm?
[6:20:48] adnips: Merc treads are good against riven!
[6:20:52] icehat_702: exactly correct
[6:20:58] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[6:21:11] criticwhospeaksfacts: what does stat check mean in simple terms
[6:21:26] adnips: @criticwhospeaksfacts I run at you and fight you and the winner has the most stats
[6:21:32] kwellxD: the "good stuff" itens , not the cheap ones ... Kappa
[6:21:36] denunciator: gotta aim for the wall for the stun!
[6:21:44] Suzakus: have to e into the wall there for the stun I tink
[6:21:50] denunciator: it pushes very far
[6:21:51] icehat_702: maybe at an angle
[6:21:52] Suzakus: it was probably not enough charge time
[6:21:53] criticwhospeaksfacts: stats meaning items or levels or kit etc?
[6:22:05] denunciator: i tink the knockback is 600 range
[6:22:06] icehat_702: maybe support briar combo is just q into e and run away
[6:22:12] icehat_702: only w for execute
[6:22:14] bladetrinity16: @criticwhospeaksfacts all
[6:22:34] adnips: Usually statcheck champs are just very strong base kit like trundle or stronger tanks
[6:22:41] kaamio1: gg Sadge
[6:22:50] denunciator: t1 picked sion supp where's apos
[6:23:01] bladetrinity16: yeah senna
[6:23:09] pavvukk_: my points DuckSadge
[6:23:13] criticwhospeaksfacts: i think go passive briar next game, just let team carry, and let enemy team make mistakes. Got to take the L route to win. don't waste 5 games figuring out the best build, you got 100  champs to go
[6:23:29] bladetrinity16: last time they did senna ornn, now its senna sion
[6:23:30] denunciator: counterpoint once briar gets going she can 1v3
[6:23:31] Ghostloon: last minute believers in shambles pfft
[6:23:52] archimedes_9: Live jules stuntWooHoo
[6:24:00] Ghostloon: Live kay stuntWooHoo

[6:24:59] bladetrinity16: @kwellxD no all support
[6:24:59] criticwhospeaksfacts: got to give asol  2 more tries then
[6:25:12] bladetrinity16: @criticwhospeaksfacts that would make 5
[6:25:12] adnips: 2 more lose bets incoming
[6:25:14] Vaaarangian: Has Ahri still been the most difficult?
[6:26:04] criticwhospeaksfacts: so at the end of the challenge, any champs you didn't win with, what punishment do you face?
[6:26:32] criticwhospeaksfacts: i mean what are the repercussions
[6:26:42] icehat_702: perfect briar game
[6:26:55] bladetrinity16: hopefully its the same karma
[6:27:04] vogue_hommes: luu Susge
[6:27:10] kwellxD: that makes things more interesting for sure
[6:27:13] denunciator: i would go tenacity vs this comp

[9:06:45] Ghostloon: you miss 100% of all autos you don't take
[9:07:35] denunciator: he has the tendency to get all-inned, and his early-game damage is loaded behind his escape spells

[9:08:03] denunciator: i suspect at higher elos good botlaners will soon find his ideal spots

[10:26:33] denunciator: @Gahellz Ming_irl
[10:26:47] pIasmate: adc has been dominant role for so many years, you serious lol
[10:26:49] NoWhiteFlags2: A lot of adc's in that elo don't believe in poking or applying lane pressure just mindlessly farm and pray jungle doesn't come while support tries to double his work load for load
[10:26:49] trowaman: I agree, I switched to shaco jungle and went from 55%wr to 75% lol
[10:26:51] Femuline: i retired support bc i feel like i have no autonomy in bronze, if my team bad it’s just gg bc i have no dmg
[10:26:53] NoWhiteFlags2: FOr lane *
[10:27:00] jeiss_v: hiii stuntt
[10:27:03] Lystrin: adc lowest agency role apc highest agency role
[10:27:13] denunciator: @Femuline in low elo i play fiddle a lot
[10:27:14] pIasmate: jungle has the highest impact though
[10:27:18] avuloseunda: @jeiss_v hiiiii cutie pekinUwu
[10:27:23] pIasmate: but it is so stressful
[10:27:44] denunciator: beside Corki they're all quite strong though i thought
[10:27:56] ledoz: Sadge
[10:27:58] Femuline: @denunciator i always wanted to try, seems fun and good. i also can only play supports with naturally high dmg output otherwise i just hate following ppl around hoping something good happens LOL
[10:28:03] trowaman: are you going in order or just any champ of that letter?
[10:28:18] denunciator: @Femuline yes, if you can actually position properly and know your windows, fiddle is just extremely abusive
[10:28:25] denunciator: minimal skillshots to compared to e.g. Swain
[10:28:32] Femuline: like playing someone like sona or soraka in low elo is just torture if team is bad
[10:28:41] denunciator: Sona is actually really strong in low elo
[10:28:41] jeiss_v: she stopped due to controversy ?
[10:29:04] denunciator: but the lower the elo, the better your position has to be
[10:29:07] denunciator: positioning*
[10:29:12] jeiss_v: ): awh

[10:30:47] denunciator: you need to prepare a slideshow for all your offmeta LUL
[10:30:50] Femuline: @denunciator yeah but sona can’t make teammates make better plays, if my teammates bad it’s not like sona can carry herself
