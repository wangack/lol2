[2:06:48] gangbunch: !build
[2:06:49] StreamElements: botrk or kraken -> guinsoos -> kraken or botrk -> wits end -> GA - grab some boots somewhere
[2:07:07] Didi_Marth: its true
[2:07:09] drivefastandfree: it's pretty much old flat armor pen
[2:07:10] KrakOune: it doesn't anymore it's true
[2:07:13] mattywadelol: you always have a solid 7xx viewer count. pretty sick
[2:07:15] Riako125: yeah, it never scaled, they nerfed it early game. and it scaled to the full amount late
[2:07:23] Esqueezius: how is that breakthrough Aware
[2:07:27] mattywadelol: its 4am here in US
[2:07:28] gangbunch: So the build is the same as last season? @cowsep
[2:07:30] AngryIndianMan: so it's back to the old armor pen
[2:07:45] Didi_Marth: Nerd
[2:08:02] Knijz: so for me
[2:08:05] Knijz: ð¤
[2:08:08] sezo_31ciogullari: it is true it gives u the features directly no matter what ur level is thats why lethality so op now
[2:08:14] centuryegg_: are you barely trying
[2:08:18] Didi_Marth: tryna calculate how much ability haste is in % is so annoying when ingame
[2:08:33] xAstra021: spyro is dead
[2:08:47] mattywadelol: not a fan of spyro tbh
[2:08:54] drivefastandfree: spyro is pretty  much a free kill, he's poop
[2:08:54] Knijz: HUH
[2:09:17] Esqueezius: HUH
[2:09:20] metalwrath22222: HUH
[2:09:22] Riako125: Ur not wrong :P, I see my mistake there.
[2:09:24] PurpleTulip007: the new adc is weak
[2:09:26] mattywadelol: im always in the losers club
[2:09:32] chuckiebobby12: dang I lost the game
[2:09:33] adrobepis: ever noticed Yi, Darius and garens over exaggerated  bottom teeth in their art? its kinda funny
[2:09:54] mattywadelol: master yi has like 8 eyes
[2:10:02] Didi_Marth: @PurpleTulip007 he's picking up some traction in high elo, wouldnt call him too weak rn
[2:10:07] mattywadelol: on his original art
[2:10:43] Didi_Marth: @adrobepis My teeth are yours.
[2:10:51] adrobepis: hahaha
[2:10:58] chuckiebobby12: how do I beat these yo played in low elo what champ do I have play to ruin them
[2:11:00] Didi_Marth: Wuju pass me that toothpaste
[2:11:03] xAstra021: clean
[2:11:11] mattywadelol: u think first round of void grubs or dragon is more important in beginning ?
[2:11:45] Didi_Marth: @mattywadelol i think its important to atleast get 1 grub, since if enemy gets 6 its way more op for them
[2:11:53] sson778: why hydra first
[2:11:56] Didi_Marth: (i am not high elo, this is my opinion)
[2:12:04] mattywadelol: its pretty much 1 or the other
[2:12:14] IllIlIlIlIll: How is watching 1080p streams on 1440p monitor?
[2:12:19] Surrenderal5: @sson778 stats. auto att reset

[2:12:34] sentwin1337: voidgrubs are insane lategame with all 6 of them
[2:12:42] mattywadelol: grub grub grub
[2:12:42] sentwin1337: you practicly need no minions to take towers
[2:12:47] gangbunch: @cowsep so which is this season's build? Keyword shows last years build
[2:12:53] Didi_Marth: have you tried sundered sky on yi? @Cowsep
[2:12:57] ahmadrfou: What is the build nowadays?
[2:13:26] drivefastandfree: the lil grubbies can eat skillshots if you're lucky on spawn timer
[2:14:09] mattywadelol: which is harder, getting out of gold or getting out of diamond xD
[2:14:15] Didi_Marth: they counteract eachother LUL
[2:14:17] LaatiMafia: BRO waiting room GIGACHAD
[2:14:56] Esqueezius: I wonder if they will disable aa reset on titanic again
[2:15:02] Esqueezius: its so sick on xin as wekk
[2:15:12] BLiTZBAN3: I find Spyro kinda underwhelming...
[2:15:15] mattywadelol: i think gold because so many people just either purposefully go afk or type
[2:15:18] chronorod: @Cowsep have you tried experimental?
[2:15:38] xAstra021: whats your rune stat?
[2:15:41] a7a234: which server ?
[2:15:41] StreamElements: server Cowsep is playing on Korea server.
[2:15:42] triniwarrior999: triniwarrior999 watched 3 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! 
[2:15:48] Didi_Marth: ever gone full tenacity Yi?
[2:16:13] mattywadelol: does spyroâs Q count as a PTA proc ? anyone know ?
[2:16:15] sezo_31ciogullari: ur drinkink water like donald trump
[2:16:20] mattywadelol: cuz his auto is slow and weak
[2:16:40] Didi_Marth: @mattywadelol it applies on-hit and on-attack
[2:16:44] xMystiquexx: random heimer in bushes
[2:17:58] sentwin1337: hullbreaker with titanic is insanely overpowered when it comes to turrets, yi melts them under seconds
[2:18:27] metalwrath22222: asol
[2:18:44] sezo_31ciogullari: karma plays pretty well
[2:18:45] metalwrath22222: classic adc
[2:18:49] madscarecrowofficial: its level 9
[2:18:49] mattywadelol: 0 dmg
[2:19:02] Davitoxxx: it does no damage until it gets the built in elder buff
[2:19:02] sentwin1337: try hull
[2:19:03] mattywadelol: it needs stacks for Q
[2:19:03] chronorod: @Cowsep very low melee range and the lowest defense and hp for adc until late game scaling true damage op elder kill
[2:19:19] ftg_crossarms: the champ is annoying all it does is run away
[2:19:36] xAstra021: wow sundered sky. new build
[2:19:41] Esqueezius: Clueless
[2:19:45] drivefastandfree: It needs to stack like veigar. except it doesn't have the burst or cc KEKW
[2:19:51] madscarecrowofficial: What make him good is one object, he dont have it
[2:19:55] chronorod: @Cowsep basically his range is so small
[2:20:02] my_life_is_pepehands: @drivefastandfree even with stacks he suck dick
[2:20:08] chronorod: @Cowsep his q does true damage late game after enough stacks
[2:20:29] drivefastandfree: @drivefastandfree yeah, it doesn't have enough damage
[2:20:34] my_life_is_pepehands: with 225 stacks (1 kill 1 stack) he still shit. Veigar with 225 stacks + items will fuck you up
[2:20:34] mattywadelol: stacks like veigar, sucks like yuumi adc
[2:20:44] madscarecrowofficial: Except Nasus...
[2:21:09] jofus9: veigar late game
[2:21:12] xAstra021: susan
[2:21:25] ftg_crossarms: veigar is kinda cracked right now
[2:21:27] my_life_is_pepehands: @jofus9 huh? veigar can one shot even at 9
[2:21:37] ElBardocio: guinso is not worth?
[2:21:45] jofus9: lol true, but he is the true late game champ
[2:21:47] Silv3rSmok3: i heard akali is broken in new season
[2:21:55] mattywadelol: when was the last time you saw an Annie in your game
[2:22:11] Silv3rSmok3: @mattywadelol yesterday in 4 games
[2:22:18] namdnasrm: Annie Bot still plays
[2:22:19] bigg_boot: nasus you get to a certain amount of stacks and more after that feels the same
[2:22:19] mattywadelol: yeah but youre not masters
[2:22:27] xAstra021: never saw annie in my games
[2:22:42] mattywadelol: havent seen annie in dia+
[2:22:52] xAstra021: im only plat. KEKW
[2:22:57] heehster: do you live in South Korea indefinitely ?
[2:23:06] Klanransalee: !korea
[2:23:06] StreamElements: Cowsep moved to Korea in September 2012 originally to become a game developer. He secured a job as a teacher fresh out of university to get his foot on the ground, failed to get any jobs as a game developer, and transitioned into a full time streamer and stayed there because he likes how the cities are set up, and how comfortable and easy it is to live there. Hes been streaming since 2014 full time.
[2:23:37] heehster: thanks
[2:23:51] my_life_is_pepehands: !passport
[2:23:51] mattywadelol: damn full time streamer for 10 years thats nuts
