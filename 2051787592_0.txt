[0:17:48] monstercrusher123: what is fappy doing?
[0:18:35] maplevalley47: Dark Harvest does not help much, if at all, during laning.
[0:18:59] aprumolaceral: a thing ipavToxic
[0:20:05] maplevalley47: Not losing laning is viable IF Teemo is a late scaling champ. But he's not. He's just a lane bully in many matchups.

[0:49:46] funhero2: yo that olaf healing is CRAZY
[0:50:14] SpringSong: it always been like that
[0:51:08] funhero2: jhin not knowing teemo started the vote
[0:51:47] SpringSong: jhin just ppl who dont use his brain
[0:52:44] ChichiMG: idk, what about fleet footwork but still ap build, just to against some champs in the early game?
[0:53:06] Pitju99: if they think this is winnable they must never surrender
[0:53:44] Asdria: ggs
[0:54:04] Clamstacker: hello from america ipav
[0:54:10] Clamstacker: can you say "q auto q auto"
[0:54:15] SpringSong: DH is so bad
[0:54:45] SpringSong: even you acn get 36 stack which is not happening most of the time you can deal slightly higher than electrocute
[0:55:31] PLEISTRIUS: dont swear
[0:56:08] Pitju99: DH is interesting cause it shows how hard it is to play without a keystone
[0:56:33] Pitju99: I feel like thats its main purpose
[0:57:05] SpringSong: dh is good only if you sure you gona win lane and enemy has 4 squishy champ so you can deal multiple dh in tf
[0:57:29] Pitju99: @springsong and maybe you could win it even harder with a real rune so
[0:57:31] Archathens: can ranged AD use Tiatanic?
[0:57:35] funhero2: yes
[0:57:41] funhero2: they just usually dont bc they dont stack hp
[0:57:47] xxpops: kracken seems meh
[1:00:51] Pitju99: 300 hp is quite a lot
[1:01:01] oldschool_71: Experimental hexplate ult cd stack with malignance ult cd?
[1:02:19] oldschool_71: Sorry for the random question...
[1:02:24] Pitju99: I think riftmaker later stage might not be that bad
[1:02:32] Pitju99: if hp is needed
[1:03:14] Pitju99: at that point the omnivamp will also amount to something
[1:03:34] SpringSong: instead of qss why not liandry?
[1:04:34] Pitju99: 18% actually did a lot though imo, this does a little bit
[1:09:59] Pitju99: press W for second lich proc?
[1:11:08] Pitju99: why are we against liandry in the first place
[1:11:10] SgpFubar: For 200 MR that some nice dmg to be honest
[1:11:52] SgpFubar: Is ad teemo fully dead or still viable in some rare scenario? Really had fun with it last season
[1:11:55] Pitju99: I thought you said that teemo doesnt oneshot until very late
[1:12:07] Pitju99: is it worth giving up liandry until then
[1:12:53] SgpFubar: I know you answer that teemo question alot btw , sorry DX
[1:13:02] Pitju99: I don't like how they can counter that with a 450gold null magic mantle
[1:13:17] Pitju99: cause youre just barely oneshotting 0 mr target
[1:13:25] kuma_0_4: its hard to oneshot with teemo when the only reliable combo is auto Q auto
[1:13:28] Pitju99: other assasins would overkill
[1:15:51] Pitju99: and we lost the hp
[1:16:51] Pitju99: I think the liandry change is the one saving grace for teemo this season
[1:17:23] Pitju99: though I guess he wouldnt have been nerfed
[1:17:29] Pitju99: without that change
[1:18:33] Pitju99: yeah and this one with nashor is a no no
[1:20:27] Pitju99: I think lategame the nashor needs to be swapped for hourglass/banshee/rookern
[1:20:42] Suicidallangel: is the build ready yet?
[1:21:35] rbz91: u need to stack it
[1:22:32] 45ms__: about 500, so 750 total
[1:22:38] rbz91: 700 is htotal?
[1:22:56] Pitju99: but it will never proc on full mana
[1:23:39] Pitju99: how do we stack tear
[1:24:16] Pitju99: it also delays first item for way too long
[1:24:33] Pitju99: yep
[1:24:49] 45ms__: time for dota
[1:24:55] Lazy_NotShy: Build to survive in this ss
[1:25:34] funhero2: maybe we just dont play for team fight
[1:25:38] funhero2: and perma split push :)
[1:26:00] 45ms__: @funhero2 hullbreaker for suvivability
[1:26:02] Pitju99: in some scenarios you have to teamfight
[1:26:04] 45ms__: :O
[1:26:34] Pitju99: youre not nasus/trundle that can take a base in 2 seconds
[1:27:35] funhero2: i mean anyone with hullbreaker becomes a splitpush threat
[1:27:58] Pitju99: not shitmo he will just die 1v1 lol
[1:28:11] funhero2: so if we cant teamfight and cant splitpush why play the champ lol
[1:28:16] funhero2: you gotta find at least something thatll work
[1:28:26] funhero2: if you cant teamfight your alternative is non interactive split push gameplay
[1:28:45] Pitju99: he can do both its just that both are difficult
[1:29:08] G__E__T__T__O: Demolish bersekers nashor i play it for 2years never go at team fights or obsectives... My elo D2 now. Last season master 61 lp
[1:29:21] Asheetomalph: have you finalized the build
[1:30:01] funhero2: tbf if ur doing a phase rush on hit build i have a hard time seeing you get caught unless u hard overstay
[1:30:29] Pitju99: @g__e__t__t__o I wonder if u could get much higher if u played a champion designed to do thaz
[1:30:32] funhero2: nvm its kled your ass getting caught
[1:31:08] Pitju99: im sure faker could get challenger with bad builds, rank doesnt make a build good
[1:31:24] G__E__T__T__O: @pitju99  for sure but iam only teemo enjoyer
[1:31:46] ForceurUltime: hello sir, there is a new Teemo challenger in EUW beside Alan. He spammed the same page EVERY game, whatever the matchup is.
[1:32:20] Pitju99: @g__e__t__t__o i get it im just saying it doesnt say much about the build, i imagine its kind of fun
[1:33:12] ForceurUltime: This guy swapped to support, I'm talking about Hotoh#EUW
[1:33:19] ForceurUltime: which plays top
[1:34:08] ForceurUltime: yea but never switches anything else, and takes DOUBLE ADAPTATIVE no atk speed
[1:34:38] Pitju99: he's probably just really good at laning
[1:34:58] ForceurUltime: yea we've been swapping runes for past 4 years and now one guy comes up with that
[1:35:10] ForceurUltime: @Pitju99 he averages 6 deaths
[1:35:40] ForceurUltime: yea but sometimes he swaps bone plating with conditio
[1:35:53] Pitju99: only fleet and only PTA are fairly viable
[1:36:05] Pitju99: those runes always have value
[1:36:09] ForceurUltime: aery would be mad at you
[1:36:27] Pitju99: I dont think aery only is good

[2:01:33] l0rdmarz: Dat nuke though
[2:01:39] Pitju99: yasuo is actually useless
[2:01:46] SpringSong: lol they lost 4v3 and there wans even 2 dmg dealer kekw
[2:03:17] SpringSong: you kinda carried that fight
[2:04:19] SpringSong: I mean that dog dmg is huge and lillia could do 1v1 to you imo
[2:05:02] Pitju99: lillia shouldnt be able to if she was balanced, like last season
[2:05:08] Pitju99: but now she prly can
[2:06:17] razer_mon: lillia can 1 v 5
[2:06:18] razer_mon: lol

[2:09:42] SzDredd: it is diamond
[2:09:48] SzDredd: no easy win Kappa
[2:10:28] cat_caelesti: Yeah, Kled at least hit turrets
[2:11:09] Pitju99: Kled can press R to engage yas does nothing but dmg
[2:11:24] Evan_AllTiny: how to make teemo viable now
[2:12:03] Evan_AllTiny: so just build damage and throw shrooms?
[2:13:40] Pitju99: he is bad but he is not the only bad champ in the game
[2:15:27] jaytoszn: i love you pav
[2:15:38] jaytoszn: im your biggest fan
[2:15:44] bentoj: i love you pav
[2:15:47] bentoj: im your biggest fan
[2:16:39] Pitju99: the worst champ in the game is skarner imo
[2:16:49] Pitju99: that kit is like so outdated
[2:17:05] razer_mon: skarner getting rework
[2:17:30] Pitju99: you have to basically sit on them to ult and it's your only good ability
[2:17:38] bentoj: check the worst win rate champ
[2:17:54] Pitju99: kogmaw at least has the potential with a good teamcomp
[2:18:10] SzDredd: Is Smaolder available?
[2:18:15] Oitetment: Yes
[2:18:30] Pitju99: warwick has a strong early game and good 1v1
[2:18:35] SzDredd: https://www.op.gg/champions?region=global&tier=all he is dead last
[2:18:58] Pitju99: amumu double Q made him a decent support
[2:19:03] Pitju99: but not great yea
[2:19:08] Flippykiller1337: yuumi used to be broken
[2:19:15] Flippykiller1337: shes shit now
[2:19:26] Pitju99: I think mundo is pretty bad as well
[2:19:33] VoodooChild420: what about chogath
[2:20:25] Pitju99: cho kinda sucks too
[2:21:13] Pitju99: but at least he's fun, skarner is bad and unfun
[2:21:33] Pitju99: thats why nobody plays it
[2:22:04] VoodooChild420: skarner can be fun its just very team oriented
[2:22:55] Pitju99: idk I don't like the idea of being completely useless against qss, I think it hurts him more than morde and malz
[2:23:08] Pitju99: pretty sure he is most hurt by qss of all champs
[2:23:08] VoodooChild420: yea thats a big issue
[2:24:38] gigleith: doesnt skarner and malzahar both have supress? isnt that qss-proof?
[2:24:39] Pitju99: I don't think ww is a bad champ
[2:25:05] Pitju99: he is just really difficult to play cause the Q has lots of skill expression
[2:26:52] Pitju99: @gigleith hell no
[2:28:22] Pitju99: I wonder if cull start can work in this matchup
[2:29:57] Oitetment: What is that cho skin?
[2:30:15] Pitju99: maybe cull would have been better
[2:31:47] Pitju99: @oitetment I wanna know too its pretty sick
[2:33:23] Oitetment: Oh it might be shanghai scrolls cho, with a chroma
[2:33:59] Pitju99: I have the mecha one and it looks worse than this imo
[2:34:40] Pitju99: this skin has really nice animations
[2:34:42] Oitetment: Yea I have the same opinion, the sounds on this skin are satisfying
[2:35:00] Oitetment: Skin release date diff I guess
[2:35:10] Pitju99: yep
[2:35:12] nklnkl9: What skin it's base teemo
[2:36:01] Oitetment: The cho'gath, not teemo @nklnkl9

[2:39:43] Pitju99: wow
[2:40:26] IZanZaraa: i play always AD vs chogath
[2:41:13] Pitju99: I think attackspeed boots for the pushing power
[2:41:42] Pitju99: cause he kinda just pushes and ignores you
[2:42:28] superbebiente_: I play dark harvest with cheap shot. it gets applied twice every quick trade as it has 4s cooldown and is affected by blind and slows(red and shrooms )
[2:42:33] Pitju99: but teemo can go cull so he gets free 400gold if he does that
[2:43:18] superbebiente_: and swifties are a must vs champs with no dashes imo
[2:44:15] Pantse_10: lesgo
[2:46:01] Pitju99: @superbebiente_ what do dashes have to do with swifties boots i dont get it

[3:12:28] Oitetment: Rare teemo carry
[3:12:39] ABlindOrphan: Felt like maybe lacking damage in the mid?
[3:12:49] maplevalley47: Nashor seemed useful enough in that last teamfight.
[3:13:00] theshadowninja89: @ipav999 I saw Manco1 full CDR build he made 12/1 against Yone..... Do u think this build is worth to try?
[3:13:00] Oitetment: Smolder execute on cho, big damage
[3:13:03] SzDredd: wtf
[3:13:04] Caspian91: wow
[3:13:12] ChichiMG: havenât play the game since smoder came outâ¦ this dmg is unreal
[3:13:13] ashdeath: she is the worst in early game tho
[3:13:14] cat_caelesti: What a rough games this last two
[3:13:25] SzDredd: how is champ with 40% wr doing so much dmg LUL
[3:13:27] Vendictor: yea his lategame is legit, but pre 250 stacks so pre 25 min is absolute garbage
[3:13:32] razer_mon: ipavCrying ipavCrying ipavCrying ipavCrying
[3:13:47] theshadowninja89: Yeah I know but Manco is good enough to solo carry
[3:13:58] Oitetment: @SzDredd 90% of games don't last long enough for him to scale to be useful
[3:14:04] theshadowninja89: I love his when he is laughing while destroying his enemy LUL
[3:14:16] ABlindOrphan: What contexts are shroom builds viable in?
[3:14:18] ChichiMG: ezreal is quite useless late game BibleThump
[3:14:19] theshadowninja89: This guy is hilarious
[3:14:19] barbolarbo: banshee is situational?
[3:14:59] Oitetment: Udyr burn through cho hp
[3:15:05] Oitetment: Liandrys
[3:15:11] ABlindOrphan: Liandry diff
[3:15:20] theshadowninja89: But the question is why u didn't make Liandry's against Cho'Gath?
[3:15:23] theshadowninja89: Lol
[3:15:25] barbolarbo: teemo was nice at the beginning of the season :(
[3:15:41] ChichiMG: udyr is op tho
[3:16:00] theshadowninja89: Because it's helping on lane phase and Liandry's dealing percentage dmg of max health
[3:16:18] Oitetment: Percent hp damage on Cho will show more damage numbers overall
[3:16:30] barbolarbo: @ChichiMG yeah, already since 2 seasons
[3:16:53] Oitetment: I mean for why it shows Udyr doing more damage
[3:16:59] Oitetment: Not why you should build Liandry
[3:17:37] theshadowninja89: Yes makes sense
[3:17:47] theshadowninja89: U need to spam Q to proke Liandry's
[3:18:10] theshadowninja89: But why not Malignance?
[3:18:17] theshadowninja89: It increase shroom dmg
[3:18:30] Oitetment: Same issue
[3:18:47] theshadowninja89: Banshee
[3:18:51] Blideth: Void staff
[3:18:52] barbolarbo: @theshadowninja89 his playstyle is more aa-oriented
[3:19:00] Blideth: Because it didn't help against Cho anyway
[3:19:04] theshadowninja89: U can give up banshee
[3:19:14] theshadowninja89: Yeah realized it @barbolarbo
[3:19:21] theshadowninja89: U have Zhonya
[3:19:27] theshadowninja89: Before he one shot you
[3:19:40] theshadowninja89: Not with 1 spell
[3:20:13] Aldurfus: banshee saved you from ez ult like 3 times too
[3:20:17] theshadowninja89: Idk it's hard to tell
[3:20:39] ChichiMG: if I had to choose, I will sayâ¦zhonya
[3:20:43] theshadowninja89: I mean u have to stay in the back as squishy champion
[3:20:48] theshadowninja89: And be covered by Udyr
[3:20:55] theshadowninja89: He is more tanky
[3:21:09] theshadowninja89: U can run with your jungler and you are safe
[3:21:12] DeadlyBoy1234: ipav is trying to all chat with gold players interacting with twitch chat lol
[3:21:51] ChichiMG: SabaPing
[3:22:00] theshadowninja89: @ipav999 I mean u can't run with Udyr he will tank the Viktor damage and u can poke and shroom all over the place
[3:22:04] theshadowninja89: I am doing that
[3:22:17] theshadowninja89: Hiding in the back when fighting 5v4
[3:22:20] theshadowninja89: 5v5
[3:22:46] theshadowninja89: I am playing this game but I am playing it different
[3:23:15] theshadowninja89: I am using the fact my jungler can cover me
[3:24:12] theshadowninja89: Maybe that's why I am Diamond LUL
[3:24:38] theshadowninja89: I mean this is a team game u need to cooperate
[3:24:43] theshadowninja89: Good macro
[3:25:22] theshadowninja89: I mean it's hard to gank Cho'Gath as an Udyr
[3:25:28] theshadowninja89: Not worth
[3:25:32] DeadlyBoy1234: wait ipav played ranked

[3:32:11] 291x: xddteemo

[5:20:34] Pitju99: LUL
[5:21:02] Odynytsia: !rank
[5:21:17] Pitju99: surely
[5:21:38] David309: thats fast
[5:21:54] Pitju99: then you get hit by 1 spell and lose relentless and W
[5:21:59] Pitju99: KEKW teemo life
[5:23:42] 514484: his build is correct, he's just not very good
[5:24:06] alogato: why no malignance???
[5:24:08] 514484: not a must
[5:24:12] klaus133769: Hello teemo man
[5:24:18] 514484: liandry makes you pretty squishy on udyr
[5:24:29] alogato: why not build malignance?
[5:24:32] 514484: so you better know what you are doing on udyr if you wanna go liandry
[5:24:52] Breathe234: some longer games there too
[5:24:53] lorensj81: gg
[5:25:35] random_spectator666: Malignacce and Liandry are items for traps , high elo know how to clean and dodge traps
[5:26:54] random_spectator666: when i play Teemo  there is 4-5 oracles if game dont end for 15 min :D
[5:27:02] alogato: thank u for the answer
[5:28:36] 514484: PogBones
[5:28:55] Oitetment: LUL
[5:29:12] Oitetment: Ipav surprised seeing teemo on winstreak
[5:32:03] Pitju99: it's funny that stats show what ipav talked about
[5:32:06] 514484: phoenix is often a trap, udyr needs to awaken W most of the time
[5:32:29] Pitju99: nashor PTA is highest winrate on NA while fleet liandry is highest on EUW
[5:32:39] Pitju99: in every tier
[5:33:51] Oitetment: Do less people play teemo in EUW?
[5:34:05] Oitetment: Sounds like EUW doesn't like buying red trinket/control wards
[5:36:03] Pitju99: actually diamond+ EUW has twice as many teemo games wow
[5:36:26] lorensj81: Fiora adc  ? :D
[5:37:16] 514484: i agree with all of this, pushing is best
[5:38:16] Pitju99: @oitetment but NA has much less games, 3.3% pickrate NA vs 2.9% EUW

[5:40:03] YolkBun: alan ipavChad
[5:42:38] Pitju99: this skin teemo is so satisfying sped up
[5:42:59] shounenhime: ASMR sound effect at this speed
[5:43:09] aurateal: lmfao
[5:43:18] aurateal: the classic baron throw
[5:43:23] Pitju99: yeah live speed i dont like it either tho I have it
[5:43:30] Pitju99: but sped up sounds good somehow
[5:44:28] SzDredd: it is still shit
[5:45:01] YolkBun: he's really out of position here ipavKEK
[5:45:41] SzDredd: Is Bamby targetable when she hops in the air?
[5:45:44] Pitju99: yea he kind of trolled by placing the trap shoulda ran
[5:46:07] Pitju99: after the hourglass though
[5:46:31] Pitju99: once she HGs her team is there
[5:47:22] Pitju99: that is true though
[5:48:06] 514484: this is a build i'm really tempted to try as a support
[5:48:13] 514484: especially with the new support item
[5:48:26] chawapiwa: the whole top side are ap
[5:49:22] SzDredd: Teemo team has 4 oracles vs 2?
[5:50:03] SzDredd: ouch
[5:50:24] SzDredd: inhib at least
[5:51:34] SzDredd: Is this Blanc ADC?
[5:51:37] SzDredd: HUH
[5:52:23] chawapiwa: how much more? void staff does a lot even to basic mr at level18
[5:52:43] SzDredd: what happened to LeBlnac AP ratios? ipavHmm
[5:52:49] shounenhime: wow g fkin g
[5:52:53] SzDredd: or is it a troll build
[5:53:08] David309: that build is about the energize dmg
[5:53:12] Pitju99: check enemy champs MR values
[5:53:12] David309: that you get from moving
[5:53:15] Pitju99: Im curious
[5:54:05] Pitju99: at the end of game
[5:55:07] Pitju99: shards are a big deal
[5:55:16] Lazynameross: RabbitArrive
[5:55:50] Pitju99: yeah i agree with sorc shoes void only like 90 mrish
[5:56:42] chawapiwa: which teemo skin has the best aaa?
[5:57:18] Oitetment: Omega squad feels good to me but I haven't tried the last 3 or so skins
[5:58:02] pikapika_666_: MYAAA
[5:58:12] David309: i think alan built void staff last game cuz he was the only ap dmg dealer
[5:58:44] chawapiwa: i play quinn vayne draven top. teemo's aa feel awful to me whenever i play him
[5:58:46] 514484: LUL
[5:58:55] 514484: draven top NotLikeThis
[5:59:04] pikapika_666_: he knew where enemy jgl is
[5:59:06] Pitju99: @david309 flat pen is better then
[5:59:26] 514484: PepeLaugh
[5:59:27] David309: yea sure but when you're ahead you discourage them from building mr
[5:59:46] 514484: maybe wanted to clear the wave and get tower shots
[6:01:33] 514484: maybe he places the ward this way because he's used to putting a shroom in it
[6:02:01] Pitju99: you miss cs
[6:03:50] Oitetment: Can try it out
[6:04:06] Pitju99: couldnt step into bard portal LUL
[6:04:07] 514484: arguard wouldn't have helped against the AP jungler
[6:04:32] Pitju99: armguard lacks damage if you rush it
[6:05:14] Pitju99: well not armguard specifically but cant finish it into a good dmg item
[6:05:28] 514484: LUL
[6:06:07] Pitju99: 0 i think
[6:06:15] Oitetment: LUL
[6:06:32] Oitetment: It procs DH too??
[6:06:39] Pitju99: its rly weird cause are you ganking bard ezreal?
[6:08:24] chawapiwa: check brand early pathing
[6:08:41] xLeSeigneurBalekx: who's the most camped stemer ?
[6:08:45] xLeSeigneurBalekx: Ipav or Zwag ?
[6:08:49] TipoG: That's the top life
[6:09:03] pikapika_666_: or clear it first
[6:09:32] Pitju99: faker probably
[6:09:55] Pitju99: or tyler 1
[6:10:58] Oitetment: WAYTOODANK
[6:11:01] xLeSeigneurBalekx: sometimes i feel like he lack dmg relying only on shroom during teamfights
[6:11:10] chawapiwa: that's his mom
[6:11:15] xLeSeigneurBalekx: i dont find shroom to deal much on their own even with lyandri/mali
[6:11:34] 514484: Shyvana needs a true damage execute too
[6:11:38] Oitetment: Maybe she'll get a better one with her rework
[6:11:40] xLeSeigneurBalekx: since most of the time it'll go on melee with stats
[6:12:12] SpringSong: his mother
[6:12:50] SpringSong: yea
[6:12:56] cuscus9214: SO WHAT
[6:13:00] pikapika_666_: yeah he calls for his mom :)
[6:13:08] cuscus9214: whats the implication!?
[6:13:13] SpringSong: he crying ''Mooooom'' so his mother came to heal him and atack enemy same time
[6:13:28] lokken_tak: the ult heals him?
[6:13:37] cuscus9214: smolder being avg player Kappa
[6:13:40] xLeSeigneurBalekx: @sir_crocodairu what's even more funny is the woman who came up with his concept got fired before his release
[6:13:51] chawapiwa: some smolder players can't cast ult ykwim
[6:15:09] Pitju99: his auto Q dmg is not that bad its just not as bursty
[6:17:58] Oitetment: 1/3 HP from trap and slow
[6:19:44] Pitju99: it would do more with sorcs
[6:20:28] xLeSeigneurBalekx: they have no mr
[6:20:29] xLeSeigneurBalekx: xD
[6:20:37] Pitju99: I think the mejai upgrade was bad, probably sorc swap plus elixir better
[6:20:42] pikapika_666_: i was close to type "gg" :D
[6:20:55] Pitju99: tho the movespeed is nice
[6:21:18] Pitju99: swap to sorc buy elixir
[6:21:21] pikapika_666_: check one where he gets ganked a lot
[6:21:38] pikapika_666_: me neither
[6:21:42] TipoG: Who are we watching?
[6:22:44] Pitju99: Its important to add that fappy pushes way more than alan
[6:22:47] TipoG: Oh ok, thanks
[6:22:54] pikapika_666_: maybe you have an aura which emanates "gank me!" :D
[6:23:26] Pitju99: im not saying it makes up all the difference but accounts for somr
[6:23:55] Brackker: Brackker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Have a great day ipavLick
[6:24:04] 514484: LUL

[6:25:33] xLeSeigneurBalekx: lee didnt lvl q
[6:26:07] 514484: stuns the shroom!
[6:26:09] 514484: KEKW
[6:26:13] aurateal: lmfao
[6:26:14] Oitetment: LMAO
[6:26:35] 514484: this is why you build Malignance, so that TF can stun the shrooms
[6:27:29] aurateal: BigBrother
[6:28:30] xLeSeigneurBalekx: she dosn't use her spell reducing dmg during blind
[6:28:34] 514484: this is braindead gameplay tbh
[6:28:38] combo800: @ipav999 max q second
[6:31:18] Pitju99: irelia is impossible without attackspeed
[6:31:21] Sietaha: OOOO
[6:31:24] aurateal: PogBones
[6:31:30] aurateal: POGGERS
[6:31:35] Oitetment: He's rich OOOO
[6:32:07] 514484: KEKW
[6:32:19] 514484: TF must throw the card at short range, otherwise blinded
[6:32:21] 514484: you do it all the time
[6:32:29] aurateal: 5Head alan knew that gold card can be retroactively blinded
[6:32:52] pikapika_666_: first trap then blind, not?
[6:32:53] justMak111: cuz of attack speed
[6:32:54] 514484: animation cancel? PogBones
[6:33:01] lokken_tak: maybe replay bug? test in training
[6:33:39] cuscus9214: r ato q ?
[6:33:49] 514484: how do they get doublekilled KEKW
[6:34:28] 514484: forgot about it
[6:34:29] Oitetment: LUL
[6:34:37] aurateal: he just forgot
[6:34:38] 514484: but wanted to go around the mioniosn for another Q maybe
[6:34:43] Pitju99: no object permanence
[6:34:46] Pitju99: happens
[6:34:58] Oitetment: He forgor ð
[6:34:59] pikapika_666_: even tfblade didnt remember the traps and he is perma rank1 :)
[6:35:39] cuscus9214: tf who?
[6:35:53] Pitju99: who is funding ipav to travel to EU to get rank 1 Kappa
[6:36:56] Oitetment: Switch to EUW, Play on 120 ping, easy wins
[6:37:15] Pitju99: travel there for good ping
[6:37:55] Oitetment: Bee skin peepoHappy
[6:38:15] Pitju99: he always does cull into ksante
[6:38:38] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[6:38:53] pikapika_666_: he only expects the most likely pathing
[6:39:10] xLeSeigneurBalekx: with pta it would be a nigtmare
[6:40:35] menta_mentol: she does
[6:42:13] 514484: santi not rushing MR
[6:42:21] 514484: bami probably wasn't right
[6:42:25] aurateal: PogBones
[6:44:11] razer_mon: FASTER
[6:44:15] razer_mon: MORE
[6:44:43] Pitju99: I think cull is good into many tanks
[6:45:30] pikapika_666_: they show brownian motion
[6:48:18] razer_mon: SEXTY
[6:49:08] 514484: KEKW
[6:49:14] Oitetment: LUL
[6:49:18] 514484: pops oracle, doesn't attack move
[6:51:16] pikapika_666_: xerath had some nice skill shots
[6:53:48] barbolarbo: traps carried this
[6:55:35] barbolarbo: oh, just noticed the teemo's cull, did you already comment his choice?
[6:56:43] Pitju99: orb seems bad here
[6:58:01] SzDredd: -7K? they have to throw hard
[6:58:43] lorensj81: Yes, dragon fight earlier
[7:00:27] SzDredd: @ipav999 you want free puzzle game - https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/doors-paradox-5896c7 ?
[7:00:50] dannyklos: why not combine nashor and dcap with malignance and liandrys
[7:04:18] Oitetment: Senna auto
[7:07:12] HermaineCocaine: Do you think it's good that liandrys is no onger a Lost chapter item?
[7:08:10] 514484: yeah at least CDR liandry gave you everything
[7:10:21] 514484: play support so that the shroom build makes the most sense?
[7:10:31] suppaahh: I only go indigenous hunter now if I go domination tree
[7:10:55] 514484: teemo everything is really bad
[7:11:11] Sietaha: the videos ive seen of teemo support are absolutely hilarious
[7:12:04] 514484: at least as support you can focus on vision
[7:12:18] 514484: people might ban teemo and tilt minute 1 tho KEKW
[7:12:51] 514484: also, karma is popular so i guess you must ban karma or something DansGame
[7:14:12] Pitju99: this game he was rly mad at nunu
[7:15:09] Pitju99: ganked lvl 6 cassio and dies
[7:15:11] metalwrath22222: brofresco lol

[7:18:56] 514484: nef teemo btw
[7:18:57] Pitju99: he was rank 1 last season
[7:19:05] TouchMyFish: corki and varus got a lot of mixed damage
[7:19:09] 514484: we add kaenic rookern, nerf teemo tho
[7:19:17] Lazynameross: Gladge a player dropping ego and building situationally
[7:19:31] Pitju99: yes
[7:20:22] Lazynameross: at least blitz solo
[7:20:41] Pitju99: I think she knows the game is over and just having fun
[7:20:47] 514484: so much shielding
[7:20:52] Pitju99: limit test
[7:21:36] Pitju99: good players know when the game is over so can limit test
[7:21:44] pikapika_666_: i think he has 50. a sec
[7:22:04] Lazynameross: checking real quick
[7:22:14] pikapika_666_: ah yes

[7:22:30] pikapika_666_: but I saw a challey with 50 yesteraday
[7:22:38] pikapika_666_: dunno who that was :)
[7:22:42] 514484: ping has improved drastically over the years
[7:22:54] 514484: used to be 50 for me, now it's 20 or 30
[7:23:10] Pitju99: 20 is only bad in korea
[7:23:29] pikapika_666_: i have 4 in eu :)
[7:24:28] Lazynameross: does malignance aoe mr shred stack since 3 champs have on his team?
[7:25:06] 514484: the build of despair from taimo
[7:25:15] 514484: building literally like if he were support
[7:25:27] 514484: stall build
[7:25:35] Pitju99: gotta say idk why he likes morello so much
[7:25:49] Lazynameross: cheap
[7:25:51] Lazynameross: gw
[7:25:55] Lazynameross: one of few sources of haste
[7:25:58] 514484: yeah it gives CDR again PogBones
[7:26:00] Pitju99: but orb?
[7:26:19] 514484: has less gold tham karma
[7:26:22] Lazynameross: it gives like 90(?) ap at upgrade
[7:27:20] Pitju99: you gotta compare orb to the finished morello
[7:27:35] Mirrorsloth: PopNemo
[7:27:40] 514484: yeah he went for the CDR to stall
[7:27:55] 514484: liandry helps with waveclear but e prefered CDR
[7:28:13] 514484: i like this
[7:28:40] caciuslove: @Alan234 is best euw
[7:28:50] Pitju99: yeah like orb +ionia if u rly want cdr

[7:29:07] 514484: did he have ionian boots?
[7:29:28] 514484: good idea to go ionian boots into this dreadful match-up
[7:29:38] pikapika_666_: which server?
[7:30:00] pikapika_666_: euw
[7:30:05] Pitju99: @514484 thats not what i mean, just that morello doesnt automatically become good imo cause of haste
[7:30:09] AvengerFer: what about manco builds?
[7:30:22] Pitju99: but maybe im wronf
[7:30:56] 514484: he really wanted utility
[7:31:00] pikapika_666_: aralia
[7:31:19] pikapika_666_: araria
[7:32:41] Pitju99: if she can go for it lvl 1 is not close
[7:32:50] pikapika_666_: close
[7:32:52] 514484: KEKW
[7:33:29] pikapika_666_: mouse probably release early
[7:33:30] 514484: looks like a failed double tap
[7:33:34] lokken_tak: her screen was near her turret prob
[7:34:07] Sietaha: :P
[7:34:08] 514484: he cancels the attack
[7:34:13] 514484: irelia won this
[7:34:31] 514484: at the very end
[7:34:52] 514484: Hotoh E, Hotoh E
[7:35:09] 514484: NVM hadn't een the new blind
[7:35:18] TouchMyFish: and all her skills were on CD.
