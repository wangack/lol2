[0:40:54] TeaQLive: a lil birdy told me to tell u to try: triforce, shojin, tear on smolder
[0:41:26] TeaQLive: tear into triforce
[0:43:01] TeaQLive: idk i dont play champs like that
[0:43:12] TeaQLive: its just what i have been told
[0:43:22] leevsku00: full ap smolder decent or trash?
[0:44:13] leevsku00: hmm interesting🤔
[0:46:38] EmmatheRedPanda: Smolder is just the absolute cutest therefore best
[0:47:24] asher_22_16: Emma I absolutely love your logic!
[0:47:48] TeaQLive: tear is build into manamune, crd boots, triforce, shojin runes: presense of mind and fleet
[0:47:53] EmmatheRedPanda: Thank you, Asher. me too :))
[0:48:08] asher_22_16: 5upL
[0:48:13] TeaQLive: thats how a german streamer (noway) played it
[0:48:41] EmmatheRedPanda: his special move is puppy dog eyes whereby enemies cannot kill him for 10 seconds
[0:48:54] NutellaHS: letsgo
[0:49:02] Beemittens: just smoldering
[0:49:39] NutellaHS: its pretty fun watching u play smolder 5up
[0:50:12] EmmatheRedPanda: to win is it destroy all enemy towers?
[0:51:00] TeaQLive: @emmatheredpanda kinda?
[0:51:22] EmmatheRedPanda: okay aha, what else?
[0:51:26] balletbunny: @emmatheredpanda destroying the big crystal (nexus) in the enemy teams base and you need to destroy the towers first to destroy the nexus
[0:51:27] quasarptolemy: technically just the one in the corner, so you could just get there via one lane, but usually requires more than one
[0:51:44] EmmatheRedPanda: Awesome, thank you!
[0:52:39] EmmatheRedPanda: I'm actually slowly picking up this game and it's becoming more enjoyable to watch now I know what's going on (mostly)
[0:52:48] TeaQLive: to get there u will prob need to kill the other team and try to get more objectives (like dragons or baron, or like u said towers)
[0:53:39] EmmatheRedPanda: Ty!
[0:54:35] TeaQLive: there is a lot to do and keep in mind, but its very entertaining to watch
[0:54:56] TeaQLive: and once most stuff becomes mindless its very fun to play
[0:55:01] nour1987: do you know that you get a stack every time you hit an enemy with a skill

[1:03:18] EmmatheRedPanda: dragon vs dragon
[1:03:41] host2s: 'my chanp isnt made for that'. proceed to 1v3 their backline
[1:04:17] OnlyRussellHD: @hughjanus9001 He is saying smolder is the same as kassadin in that not very strong early but hits a point where they are.
[1:07:15] BluerBlack: discustin?
[1:07:33] EmmatheRedPanda: what happens when you get to 125?
[1:08:00] wolven9: 125 gives the extra splashes behind the target

[1:14:56] toytrainsgoburr: not5upWiggle
[1:15:01] host2s: low wr i think
[1:15:04] hughjanus9001: not viable in rlcs though or is it? cse rlcs mostly ends before minute 25 lol
[1:15:04] host2s: people still learning
[1:15:22] Ninjaboy9310: Because his early game is really weak
[1:15:22] xthe_spacemanx: think about how many diamond games end pre 20
[1:15:23] hughjanus9001: lcs lol i watched too much rocket league
[1:15:35] xthe_spacemanx: after 30 mins he 1v9s
[1:15:41] xthe_spacemanx: but before that he’s tough
[1:15:42] wolven9: if you plan to drag the game past 25, i think lcs teams can do it
[1:16:24] vsmilotic: 5up dragon master now
[1:16:51] EmmatheRedPanda: 5molder ? bahaha
[1:17:38] vsmilotic: best smorder NA soon
[1:18:15] valdaftw: It's a ranged nasus, with an AOE q
[1:19:45] TeaQLive: tear is build into manamune, crd boots, triforce, shojin runes: presense of mind and fleet; that how NoWay (a german streamer) played it
[1:19:50] TeaQLive: in case u wanna try
[1:19:54] valdaftw: He's gonna go the usual route, get buffed, become obscenely powerful, become perma pick/ban, get nerfed to oblivion and goes to the forgotten land of useless champs
[1:20:21] valdaftw: And only come back when meta becomes slow and less early game focus

[1:57:33] Carnavious: nice
[1:57:42] Carnavious: looks like smolder top has the same wr as adc
[1:57:50] Carnavious: maybe because easier to stack
[1:58:12] BluerBlack: It shouldnt be that bad
[1:58:19] BluerBlack: to keep lane and farm
[1:58:30] 9fierce9: Hi hi 5up
[1:58:41] JustaStoopidDog: veigar
[1:58:44] JustaStoopidDog: eqse
[1:59:05] PsycheKit: smolder top seems pretty fun but the mobility is soooo terrible
[1:59:05] JustaStoopidDog: yeah the e is garbage
[1:59:16] PsycheKit: you really need a support to stop you from exploding
[1:59:26] PsycheKit: e is good for chasing, not for running
[1:59:29] Carnavious: yeah he sucks into a lot of bruisers but has a really high wr into tanks
[1:59:33] PsycheKit: unless you fly over terrain with it
[1:59:49] PsycheKit: its not as good as kayn e for running i dont think
[2:01:06] AwesomeTree: KEKW
[2:01:23] JustaStoopidDog: ive been seeing people saying hes bad but its only what 4 days KEKHeim
[2:01:40] PsycheKit: i dont think smolder is unsalvageable
[2:01:45] TwinDissonance: varus maybe?
[2:01:50] PsycheKit: very fun kit, just not super powerful atm it seems
[2:02:04] JustaStoopidDog: twitter

[2:03:25] JustaStoopidDog: i think people arent getting to maxxed out q
[2:03:28] PsycheKit: this seems like a game where the enemy smolder could super pop off
[2:03:36] PsycheKit: dunno about the yuumi sup but hey
[2:03:45] AwesomeTree: YUUMI SMOLDER LETS GO
[2:03:48] AwesomeTree: DISNEY LANE

[2:05:29] communist_uwu: im watching today, cause I want to watch mcl but i have no idea how league works
[2:05:39] JustaStoopidDog: is the custom made or is there a server for it?
[2:05:43] JustaStoopidDog: it*
[2:05:49] Ambessss: that sounds like it could be amazing but hard to pull off
[2:05:49] PsycheKit: ^ yeah i would love a server for that
[2:06:00] Skrunken: sounds interesting, will you stream it? or do you have a link to the people who will? @5up

[2:09:38] sid7_: Is it a one-day tournament?
[2:09:39] JaxxRL: what is the secret to smolder?
[2:09:42] JaxxRL: *thinking*
[2:09:46] asher_22_16: 5upPog
[2:09:47] PsycheKit: @JaxxRL never get hard ccd ever
[2:10:29] GrumpySkelly: how do you feel about his heavenscale skin
[2:10:34] PsycheKit: W is genuinely a very solid playmaker in lane since it slows both champs (also +2 stacks)
[2:10:47] PsycheKit: heavenscale is... eh
[2:10:53] vsmilotic: its not even look like dragon LUL
[2:10:56] AwesomeTree: he looks like a cat with heavenscale
[2:11:04] PsycheKit: its like the classic western vs eastern dragon vibe
[2:11:06] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up

[2:12:57] PsycheKit: ive been mostly doing tear start
[2:13:33] JaxxRL: manamune game?
[2:13:34] PsycheKit: but i guess aggro is better with blade
[2:14:08] zero_is_d3ad_: hi 5up!
[2:14:19] ar_pachauri: What happened in the last game ?
[2:14:46] JustaStoopidDog: that one minion really fucked you up
[2:15:04] JaxxRL: smolder q would proc both damage instances of muramana right?
[2:15:41] JaxxRL: yeeeaaa
[2:15:56] vsmilotic: LUL
[2:16:53] JaxxRL: wait, theres something that keeps you from using your support items stacks?
[2:17:46] vsmilotic: KEKW doom
[2:17:53] PsycheKit: Aware
[2:18:38] PsycheKit: this lulu is an interesting specimen
[2:18:46] PsycheKit: she is just straight up sniping stacks from you
[2:19:55] PsycheKit: how is eve alive there
[2:20:01] PsycheKit: that is so bad
[2:20:14] ffsidn: you outscale their team no?
[2:21:13] savvy_with_it: Ranked or norms?
[2:21:45] piveel: hi chat hi mr streamer 5upL
[2:21:58] piveel: how are the games going?
[2:22:13] otiswilbur: ah hell nah, 5up on the elo printing champ monkaW
[2:22:20] PsycheKit: and lulu gets the shut down
[2:23:03] sansin: YEAAAHHHHHHHH
[2:23:04] otiswilbur: ngl, lulu is not the champ to play with smolder, no?
[2:23:18] PsycheKit: no not really, even at the best of times
[2:23:18] sansin: Smolder time
[2:23:28] sansin: He's so cute TT^TT
[2:23:40] piveel: agreed
[2:23:45] piveel: but a menance
[2:23:49] otiswilbur: @PsycheKit ye i was gonna say, lulu pairs best with auto attackers like jinx and twitch KEKW
[2:24:25] PsycheKit: i think the best option is a hybrid enchanter like rakan tbh
[2:24:26] otiswilbur: i didnt get plat Sadge
[2:24:33] PsycheKit: someone with lots and lots of peel
[2:24:49] otiswilbur: sera could be decent with smolder
[2:24:55] PsycheKit: sona too
[2:25:05] otiswilbur: yeee
[2:25:05] PsycheKit: maybe less than sera though
[2:25:12] PsycheKit: i would even consider kench or thresh
[2:25:18] PsycheKit: anyone that can get smolder the fuck out of dodge
[2:25:19] otiswilbur: idk, isnt sera just sona v2? KEKW
[2:25:38] sansin: WELP
[2:25:55] piveel: I love naut as sup
[2:26:20] otiswilbur: theyre a sera main and they pick lulu with smolder
[2:26:21] otiswilbur: what
[2:26:42] sansin: Hi bb
[2:26:44] PsycheKit: this is what happens when people compare smolder to kog
[2:26:48] otiswilbur: they might deserve to be permad KEKW
[2:26:54] PsycheKit: ppl just assume you play lulu even though they're nothing alike
[2:26:59] sansin: Sounds like you've had an interesting game.
[2:27:09] otiswilbur: how is smolder even close to kog KEKW
[2:27:19] WOlfikun: Anyone playing smolder atm is trollling.. smolder needs a hotfix buff.. there a reason its not banned everygame like other new champs
[2:27:26] sansin: OOF.
[2:27:44] otiswilbur: smolder doesnt even build attack speed OMEGALUL
[2:28:11] sansin: I believe in the 5up supremacy
[2:28:29] WOlfikun: I doo too.. but the champion itself.. :(
[2:28:36] PsycheKit: belveth heard 15 cs = 1 kill and took that personally
[2:28:57] piveel: you gotta believe in smolder
[2:29:30] 9fierce9: This is gake is not a smoulder problem at all
[2:29:49] piveel: yeah
[2:30:01] PsycheKit: one teamfight will change this game straight up
[2:30:09] PsycheKit: if you get 4 1k gold shutdowns the game swings so hard
[2:30:40] RavenEmir: ff15
[2:30:51] sansin: I wish I was good then I would offer to be yelled at by you.
[2:31:45] beess__: leeg

[2:33:13] balletbunny: peepoSad
[2:33:13] sansin: D:
[2:33:29] PsycheKit: maybe the ult needs a hotfix to actually finish casting once the startup concludes
[2:33:34] sansin: T^T
[2:33:45] piveel: huge
[2:33:46] PsycheKit: huge
[2:33:47] beess__: have there just been losses?

[2:34:20] piveel: we good still winnable
[2:34:23] balletbunny: winnable Shirley
[2:34:24] PsycheKit: going 1 for 1 in that situation is totally fine
[2:34:30] PsycheKit: you lost 150 gold and gained 1k
[2:34:34] piveel: 5upHop
[2:35:45] piveel: oh u trying new runes?
[2:36:01] PsycheKit: @piveel he accidentally had MF runes on
[2:36:05] 9fierce9: Not by choice KEKW
[2:36:16] PsycheKit: is this an electrocute champ btw? or is PTA just that much better

[2:37:15] PsycheKit: cull pop 25 mins in Aware
[2:40:04] valdaftw: Stop talking to them xD, it's pointless, just gonna tire you more
[2:40:20] PsycheKit: so hard to not die in that lane and then you get flamed for bot gap even though supp was definitely the problem
[2:41:02] valdaftw: Mid jungle supp gap, it's completely normal to lose
[2:41:04] 9fierce9: Not to mention lulu
[2:41:05] PsycheKit: yeah the early gank basically meant the lane was pretty hard lost
[2:41:07] PsycheKit: very sad
[2:41:07] ar_pachauri: Check the support player
[2:41:39] PsycheKit: 0% winrate on lulu ICANT
[2:41:54] MariiWotterii: HOW
[2:42:02] MariiWotterii: how they int with LULU
[2:42:55] PsycheKit: autofill jungler on tilt
[2:42:57] PsycheKit: thats tragic
[2:43:13] CraeSrus: Ultimately as the game went it felt like qiyana had to convert some kills but just didn't
[2:43:15] 9fierce9: Isnt Aatrox ok in Jungle?
[2:44:40] 9fierce9: Its winnable if they let your hyper scaler champion to hyper scale
[2:45:14] iggeh: be sure to tell your teammates they have broad shoulders
[2:45:19] piveel: you are playing league I don't think they care

[2:46:45] piveel: he almost did it again
[2:46:46] balletbunny: @9fierce9 om
[2:47:22] Ambessss: i feel like the item is not the issue
[2:47:29] Ambessss: but some of the champs that use it are busted
[2:47:31] MariiWotterii: it's too op in champs like karma or heimer

[2:50:57] piveel: you still max e before w?
[2:51:36] maedrescher: anyone in chat could explain me why as mao supp you go your w first llvl 1
[2:51:56] Confidor: I know you wouldnt build it on Smolder but an Item like the Collector would be useless due to the passive? Just curious
[2:52:01] jeskieKAT: Fierce :3
[2:52:13] 9fierce9: That milio is the Lulu last game om

[3:15:00] Polypuff: Smolder Shyvana bot lane when
[3:15:12] PsycheKit: smolder's level 3 is not the worst but it sure aint great
[3:15:49] PsycheKit: yeah his q is basically a bad auto reset until 125 stacks
[3:18:03] PsycheKit: i smell a dodge on this game

[3:28:17] Confidor: AY Senna lvl 2 lets go
[3:28:54] pureiinsanity: elise greedy
[3:28:55] 9fierce9: Like instead of playing to try and get botlane ahead senna tried to lose both top and botlane
[3:29:03] pureiinsanity: elise is a creature
[3:29:16] Skrunken: wild game
[3:29:26] PsycheKit: elise and senna are driving the clown car this game
[3:30:13] maverickx29: But a fight is happening
[3:30:17] Beemittens: why is the support not supporting??
[3:30:26] maverickx29: She will surly have an impact and not die again
[3:30:33] Enma_o: I just joined, what is this game LUL
[3:30:34] Polypuff: DO I SEE A 7 PogChamp
[3:30:40] Beemittens: surely

[3:30:55] lilypadlak: lilypadlak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! 37 months 5upOOO hope everyone is doing well~ lilypa14L
[3:31:03] GrumpySkelly: @Beemittens she's supporting... the shen for some reason

[3:31:35] lilypadlak: Tay!!
[3:31:44] lilypadlak: Awww the badge!!
[3:31:48] PsycheKit: the senna calling the shen a boosted ape then going to help him instead of letting him feed and actually doing her job is literally madness
[3:31:54] PsycheKit: and theyre gonna blame the champion again too
[3:32:00] Beemittens: this is going great :)
[3:32:02] Skrunken: Senna has been in bot lane for like 30 seconds out of the 10 minutes of this game
[3:32:03] Enma_o: she's still lvl3 monkaS
[3:32:19] Beemittens: wooo 7

[3:36:56] Confidor: I mean Shen, Vlad, Senna and Smolder.. Late game god comp?
[3:37:01] maverickx29: 10-0, i wonder where most of those kills came from?
[3:37:02] BluerBlack: I would just block them at this point
[3:37:11] PsycheKit: senna having the audacity to bitch about people not grouping
[3:37:11] Confidor: its getting there thats the issue
[3:37:30] Dia187: do smolder passive stacks fall off on death?
[3:37:35] HyperionComplex: lmao outplayed hard
[3:37:36] Skrunken: and havent even sacrificed you for a good reason, not like she got things done anywhere else either
[3:37:37] champrath: ezreal got cooked
[3:37:45] PsycheKit: like you win every teamfight forever its just gonna suck if senna and shen cant play the game
[3:37:51] 9fierce9: That was so good

[3:43:35] blai01: "come on, stop backing 2 sec"
[3:43:41] Hevek_xD: it's not spanish, it's portuguese
[3:43:43] 9fierce9: Nothing profanity though so dont worry
[3:44:30] divax0x0: Is this the new dragon champ
[3:44:59] Confidor: @5up Does additional stacks help the champions or is it useless?
[3:45:02] vashytalaty29: 15 more till become powerful
[3:45:09] Confidor: passed the top tier
[3:45:23] piveel: we live these

[3:49:15] piveel: true
[3:49:23] piveel: chat warrior
[3:49:23] Gragnoth: @vashytalaty29 deals damage in a line, more damage from center of ult, heals himself if he's in it
[3:49:25] Synex_ow: what is the like white line on enemy health bars, its like the execute thing but smolder ult not an execute no?
[3:49:34] PsycheKit: @Synex_ow Q is an execute
[3:49:38] 9fierce9: Senna has no right to speak when she singlehandedly lost 2 lanes
[3:49:40] Synex_ow: ahh ty
[3:49:44] quasarptolemy: after 225 stacks q gets execute
[3:50:02] claystern1: !mouse

[3:52:27] Enma_o: with how they are playing
[3:52:52] maverickx29: Excent question, how many senna souls?
[3:53:06] PsycheKit: if we win we deserve it, if we lose everyone else sucked
[3:53:08] will_occam: Spanish

[3:55:37] king_george_2: this is lost nvt mind xD
[3:55:43] PsycheKit: shen deserves the honor for huge KP while getting flamed all game
[3:55:46] divax0x0: 5upL
[3:55:49] Beemittens: thank god that’s over
[3:56:06] Confidor: Depends how late game we are talking about yeah?
[3:56:42] PsycheKit: that game was punishment from the gods
[3:56:43] vashytalaty29: maybe like 30 min
[3:57:02] hoshiNstar: What happened yo the shen
[3:57:07] toytrainsgoburr: Tbh, shen got really screwed over that game from the very beginning. Feel bad for him a bit since he was also The only nice one on the team
[3:57:10] PsycheKit: senna just decided that this game needed to be played like a chimpanzee
[3:57:32] PsycheKit: yeah shen's mental fortitude was incredible considering how fucked he got
[3:57:33] Confidor: With Stacking Veigar, Nasus,
[3:57:40] Confidor: Senna
[3:57:53] Beemittens: yeah that was doomed
[3:57:55] vashytalaty29: ok cool cool thanks
[3:58:14] Pyronorm: I see I joined the stream at a fun time
[3:58:15] Confidor: Add him as a Friends ... DO EEET Keepo
[3:58:25] divax0x0: You know last time you played league before a MC event you won
[3:58:33] Skrunken: Senna was beyond your 1st tower for like 1  minute, tops, all game
[3:58:44] piekilluxxfuzzy: top 4 morg wouldve been good enough
[3:59:05] domenest: lvl 2 at 7 min is insane
[3:59:07] Confidor: then died 1v3 top lane then called everyone else boosted
[3:59:12] PsycheKit: i cant believe the audacity for senna to bitch about shen not supporting you properly
[3:59:12] Confidor: you forgot that bit
[3:59:15] h3dg3boi: Are you gonna keep streaming until the minecraft thing today
[3:59:18] Enma_o: why would you even pick Senna to roam all game
[3:59:20] Gragnoth: also that speedy support Maokai was terrifying! XD
[3:59:29] Enma_o: there are so many better support for the roam playstyle
[3:59:36] Gragnoth: He'd just run at you, w and throw you back into his team
[3:59:39] veerveer_: yeah im not going back to this game I think
[3:59:48] 9fierce9: Are you gonna stream after the minecrafg thing?
[3:59:59] divax0x0: Do you think your team can win mcl
[4:00:10] veerveer_: how was this diamond even...
[4:00:12] PsycheKit: i genuinely think senna just fucked everyone's mental
[4:00:19] veerveer_: I played unranked back in the day even that wasnt that bad
[4:00:27] Enma_o: just your average sane league players Kappa
[4:00:37] PsycheKit: senna straight ran it down
[4:00:40] Gragnoth: the Mao even picked up the wrong support item
[4:01:05] alexpan1356: o
[4:01:06] domenest: senna supp xdd
[4:01:09] veerveer_: uh oh
[4:01:13] alexpan1356: oh nooo
[4:01:13] PsycheKit: monkaW
[4:01:13] Beemittens: it better not be the same senna support
[4:01:21] Beemittens: oh god it is
[4:01:34] PsycheKit: the "link opgg" before insta deleting it
[4:01:47] PsycheKit: she banned maokai monkaW
[4:01:47] Cleophi: why are there two gromps
[4:01:49] vDaishar: <2
[4:01:57] toytrainsgoburr: Question, why do you always ban blitzcrank over someone like Malkoi? I’d assume mal would be more annoying to deal with over blitz
[4:02:11] PsycheKit: @toytrainsgoburr blitz hard wins vs this champion
[4:02:14] Gragnoth: yeah, mid and 5up are both Gromp! XD
[4:02:36] Pyronorm: Watch it be the same Senna, lmao
[4:02:42] PsycheKit: vs the vlad from last game xdd
[4:02:44] piveel: I wouldn't gamble on it
[4:02:46] Pyronorm: Oh, yeah, wild. Two Gromps
[4:02:48] flamesmcgay: NotLikeThis
[4:02:52] toytrainsgoburr: I don’t think it’s a diff senna tbh
[4:02:57] 9fierce9: The only players that like blitzcrank is blitzcrank players
[4:02:58] tori_midnight: gromp gromp
[4:03:01] PsycheKit: wtf is this comp btw
[4:03:06] divax0x0: Um stage a DC internet stopped working
[4:03:13] Skrunken: can you check their history in the lobby?
[4:03:17] 9fierce9: Other than that blitz is universallythe most hated vhamp
[4:03:46] 9fierce9: Dont think its the same senna, last one didnt use a skin
[4:04:08] Beemittens: thank god
[4:04:09] divax0x0: Oh thank god
[4:04:11] domenest: seems sane so far
[4:04:12] toytrainsgoburr: Nvm this senna seems to way nicer than the other one
[4:04:14] PsycheKit: sigh of relief
[4:04:31] PsycheKit: senna one trick too
[4:04:33] toytrainsgoburr: Love senna’s name
[4:04:34] veerveer_: Gladge
[4:04:36] PsycheKit: you should be fine this game
[4:04:46] 9fierce9: Ah yes Senna the Senna otp
[4:05:00] vDaishar: vDaishar subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! I cast untilt
[4:05:08] Confidor: So i take it Smolder is fun to play>
[4:05:23] Komar95_: @vDaishar roll d20
[4:05:43] Confidor: ah so Trist, Kog, vayne etc etc?
[4:05:46] divax0x0: It's a cute happy dragon what's not to love
[4:05:48] PsycheKit: this should be a good game for you
[4:05:56] alexpan1356: he looks so earnest
[4:06:02] PsycheKit: karma senna jax all set up really good pick opportunities for you
[4:06:07] vDaishar: @Komar95_ I got an 11 5upBlank
[4:06:25] toytrainsgoburr: Why’d you zoom in on the dragons ugly face 5upHi 5upFine
[4:06:34] Confidor: Another Senna... Lets go XD
[4:06:35] Komar95_: physical tilt gone but still tilted
[4:06:44] divax0x0: @toytrainsgoburr ugly???
[4:06:48] hoshiNstar: The difference... it's amazing
[4:07:05] toytrainsgoburr: @divax0x0 I find it ugly
[4:07:26] toytrainsgoburr: @divax0x0 I prefer his face on his other skin way more
[4:07:27] sansin: :3 :3 :3
[4:07:35] maverickx29: Pengu dab dolphinLUL
[4:07:39] vashytalaty29: craaaazy
[4:07:39] Beemittens: who would’ve thought!
[4:07:45] Enma_o: this Senna is just good
[4:07:45] veerveer_: supports supporting? what??
[4:07:54] Enma_o: you don't win if the Senna is bad lol
[4:07:56] PsycheKit: you mean if you have a support doing their job you can play the game? wow
[4:07:57] Gragnoth: lol, my internet died for a bit there, so not the same senna?
[4:08:07] Skrunken: weird how that happens
[4:08:34] Gragnoth: wait their summoner name is legit "senna"?
[4:08:37] vashytalaty29: correct, not same senna
[4:08:39] Confidor: Nah not the same seena
[4:09:04] 1PolarFrost1: @Gragnoth I think thats if they have the anon setting on
[4:09:41] Gragnoth: I mean it was slow pushing anyways, may as well hard push and let the two waves crash so it pushes back, no?
[4:09:52] Gragnoth: @1PolarFrost1 ah, thanks, didn't know there was a setting for that
[4:10:18] toytrainsgoburr: 5upGun
[4:10:58] 9fierce9: Deleted
[4:11:31] maverickx29: What are the upgrade stack amounts?
[4:11:41] PsycheKit: 25,125,225
[4:11:54] maverickx29: Ty!
[4:12:03] 9fierce9: 30, 110, 225 i think
[4:12:57] 1PolarFrost1: Q scales infinitely no?
[4:13:10] PsycheKit: Yeah he stacks forever
[4:13:12] 9fierce9: It does but it levels up at different stacks
[4:13:19] PsycheKit: but the upgrades for Q effects are specific intervals
[4:13:29] Gragnoth: where is senna?
[4:13:36] Ambessss: @PsycheKit got them right
[4:13:48] 1PolarFrost1: gone, never to return
[4:13:55] Gragnoth: there she is
[4:13:59] 9fierce9: Went for the milk
[4:14:04] taytayabby: Hehe
[4:15:51] Ambessss: I saw you go first strike earlier how did that go?
[4:15:52] greaxxyy: damn
[4:15:57] PsycheKit: 2v1 double is so sick
[4:16:18] Ambessss: oh ok
[4:17:10] beato_ch: wait execute is so big
[4:17:10] vDaishar: 528
[4:17:13] beato_ch: no gold on ur enemy team
[4:17:13] PsycheKit: execute is ideal there for sure
[4:17:15] maverickx29: Well, executed at least
[4:17:32] GrumpySkelly: the tower vaporized your hp dang
[4:17:53] BluerBlack: Member old towers where people were scared to get even close without minions? LUL
[4:18:21] beato_ch: 3 seconds cc :)
[4:18:41] Confidor: Be interesting if they made tower shots true damage
[4:19:05] BluerBlack: I think it used to be that way

[4:21:28] taytayabby: monkaa
[4:21:32] Skrunken: no, but frames dropped
[4:21:58] PsycheKit: youd hope that when their entire team shows to smash you your team would use the opportunity to make plays
[4:22:06] JickyJack: is smolder even good champ?
[4:22:29] Gragnoth: @JickyJack very good champ, imaging an adc nasus
[4:22:45] PsycheKit: @JickyJack seems like a well designed stacking champ to me (very rare)
[4:23:04] iauja: why arent they hitting you
[4:23:08] NydusHerMain: holy fuck you get so many stacks
[4:23:09] NydusHerMain: yeah
[4:23:14] maverickx29: Welp... u asked dolphinLUL
[4:23:16] iauja: are they stupid
[4:23:17] alexpan1356: Pog
[4:23:20] pilot_wk: they just let you wreck lmao
[4:23:37] BluerBlack: Oh nvm
[4:23:56] BluerBlack: it just scaled crazily with each hit
[4:24:07] BluerBlack: 25% more damage each turret hit
[4:24:21] alexpan1356: lol
[4:24:33] maverickx29: dolphinRage
[4:25:07] Gragnoth: it seems to me that smolder just wants to fight none-stop to get his stacks rather than trying to farm
[4:25:16] Gragnoth: almost like poking gives him more than the farm
[4:25:18] PsycheKit: yeah smolder is a poke champ
[4:25:21] PsycheKit: more than a farmer
[4:25:24] Katreeni: Katreeni subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! TPFufun

[4:26:28] asher_22_16: welp gg
[4:26:28] Gragnoth: I mean, there's some LP, right? that's the ultimate goal
[4:26:29] Confidor: Do you think Smolder is in a good spot or under or over tuned atm?
[4:26:36] mitchie_2484: gg!
[4:26:42] Enma_o: it's time for another tilter, can't have too many good games
[4:26:47] BluerBlack: Are you going to try top?
[4:26:56] Gragnoth: anyways, I gotta head off, helping someone move lumber, best of luck on your games 5up!
[4:27:15] GrumpySkelly: ahri moment
[4:27:15] 1PolarFrost1: 13?
[4:27:21] PsycheKit: i think the fact that some ppl think he's good early and weak late and others think he's good late and weak early, tells me he's in a very good spot
[4:27:21] alexpan1356: 17?
[4:27:27] JustaStoopidDog: 14
[4:27:29] taytayabby: Rosieshockblink
[4:27:29] Confidor: Because titties
[4:27:34] NutellaHS: $$$
[4:27:34] JustaStoopidDog: oh fuck
[4:27:36] Gragnoth: that doesn't include the Chromas
[4:27:37] PsycheKit: ppl are horny for the fox girl
[4:27:38] Gragnoth: <3
[4:27:43] vDaishar: Because fox girl
[4:27:49] vashytalaty29: @gragnoth bye!
[4:27:51] JustaStoopidDog: shes gonna get another when kda comes back
[4:27:52] NydusHerMain: people who think he wins early
[4:27:59] GrumpySkelly: I can't remember if lux have more
[4:27:59] NydusHerMain: just can't land skillshots
[4:28:03] PsycheKit: doublelift was complaining that he's good early but doesn't scale :)
[4:28:07] NydusHerMain: they're probably losing to him using Q on them
[4:28:07] Gragnoth: @vashytalaty29 see yeah
[4:28:09] PsycheKit: i disagree of course but hey
[4:28:26] Ambessss: I guess those people just lost to his poke and are coping
[4:28:34] Vincetw: Maybe because he's safe
[4:28:36] NydusHerMain: his push is obnoxious early with W
[4:28:38] iauja: i thinks hes good w/ milio
[4:28:38] Vincetw: easy to farm safely
[4:28:42] JustaStoopidDog: hes gonna get buffed hes gonna get buffed
[4:28:48] PsycheKit: i think they see his poke but dont really understand how his Q scales
[4:28:49] Confidor: Youd have to share a link to doublelift saying that. I dont doubt ya its just I dont think Doublelift would say that XD
[4:29:08] PsycheKit: @Confidor he made a whole YT video about it
[4:29:37] taytayabby: catJAM
[4:30:12] BluerBlack: Is it Vayne broken?
[4:30:14] PsycheKit: he's broken but he's not a traditional ADC
[4:30:19] PsycheKit: hes much closer to an ezreal
[4:30:42] Confidor: Ezreal + Viegar = Smolder Imo
[4:30:53] PsycheKit: i think smolder excels in front to back teamfights
[4:31:24] sappheronion: feels more like corki
[4:31:27] Confidor: Fight Draven 1v1 do it...
[4:31:45] Confidor: Draven + Karma lane would be aids
[4:31:50] MustardNischal: do u still play palworld
[4:32:10] PsycheKit: kalista alistar lane sounds like a nightmare for us to walk into
[4:32:14] PsycheKit: alistar lands one E we die
[4:32:15] Skreeperton: I’ve seen a lot of people playing smolder mid do u think he’s better there or bot?
[4:32:17] PsycheKit: its so scary
[4:32:38] toytrainsgoburr: Do you plan on playing mafia with chat anytime soon?
[4:32:38] PsycheKit: @Skreeperton smolder seems good mid but definitely better ADC since you lack mobility to roam
[4:32:45] maverickx29: What informs u to pick blade vs ring start?
[4:33:11] PsycheKit: i mean the W does all you really need it to do
[4:33:14] Ambessss: I just saw the double lift video and it's his first impressions off of one game, and tbh I can see how he got to that conclusion with just that game
[4:33:23] Vincetw: My friend is silver and I'm gold one now I don't want to play because if I get plat I can't play with my friend. I have reverse ladder anxiety
[4:33:49] minismile_: okay i am back
[4:33:55] Vincetw: :)
[4:33:58] taytayabby: wb Mini peepoSitHey
[4:33:58] Skreeperton: @psychekit gotcha that makes sense
[4:34:02] minismile_: ha tay
[4:34:03] minismile_: hai
[4:34:06] minismile_: i was having lunch
[4:34:24] Ambessss: @Vincetw having a friend to catch up to usually helps you get better
[4:34:35] Ambessss: leave him in the dust
[4:34:42] Enma_o: @Vincetw just int some games if you win too much FeelsOkay
[4:35:33] Vincetw: I tough, Ill play a new champ and that might lose me some game without greifing. Then I won 2 game with Smolder crushingly
[4:36:04] Vincetw: I refuse to greif game ofc
[4:36:39] Confidor: Triforce any good on smolder?
[4:36:41] PsycheKit: the brand jungle is the karma from last game
[4:36:44] PsycheKit: holy GIGACHAD
[4:36:53] PsycheKit: @Confidor nah bc you take ER and you already get sheen from that
[4:36:58] minismile_: fun
[4:37:11] PsycheKit: plus you scale so hard with crit
[4:37:27] Confidor: ah fair enough

[4:42:16] cari141: @lil__soupy in 3h
[4:42:22] 9fierce9: From that great Smolder game to this
[4:42:46] Confidor: Think this one might be a go next
[4:43:30] PsycheKit: kallista is 8/1
[4:43:33] PsycheKit: terrifying
[4:43:39] Vincetw: She even got cooldown reduction to die faster
[4:43:43] PsycheKit: yeah its winnable, shutdowns are big swingy
[4:43:46] lil__soupy: i mean the majority of the games i played yesterday in bot where without a support because they taught they were needed at mid the entire game
[4:43:49] Confidor: Ali is only lvl 6.. but he is getting work done
[4:44:10] 9fierce9: Support players stop being elo boosted challange
[4:44:36] Ambessss: THE LOOP
[4:44:36] Confidor: Style points
[4:44:40] Vincetw: Smolder ghosting away with is little paw is so funny
[4:45:00] Pyronorm: She got a Null Magic
[4:45:02] Pyronorm: lmao
[4:45:55] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com

[4:46:32] PsycheKit: autofill is a plight
[4:46:38] dudepolo: i just had a supp that would back before every fight and obj... you can't tell me these players know what they're doing.
[4:47:05] PoteetLee: !rank
[4:47:07] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond I 45 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[4:47:08] 9fierce9: Its just an unlucky game
[4:47:09] PsycheKit: youre not gonna be a champion
[4:47:15] FreeXe: It shouldnt be allowed to play the new champs in ranked for the first patch :')
[4:47:25] Confidor: Not with that attitude
[4:47:49] PsycheKit: @FreeXe this is unironically not a champion or adc issue
[4:48:11] minismile_: hai poteet
[4:48:17] PoteetLee: Heyo.
[4:48:19] FreeXe: @FreeXe Oh no I mean for every champ that they realease in general
[4:48:26] lil__soupy: hello poteet 5upWave

[4:48:43] PoteetLee: Hey hey
[4:48:45] Confidor: Sucks as a hyper carry that when you get behind.. you get so fucked for quite some time
[4:49:42] 9fierce9: I knew Vlad heals much but that much was surprising
[4:49:56] PsycheKit: mortal reminder third item seems like a solid choice
[4:49:59] Confidor: well Vlad is fed
[4:50:17] AwesomeTree: !rank

[4:51:10] 9fierce9: ouch
[4:51:31] Enma_o: at least it was quick and relatively painless
[4:51:36] 9fierce9: How did Supports get so boosted?
[4:51:37] Confidor: thats a sad looking graph
[4:52:09] PsycheKit: its so hard to tell if this champ is good because the games live and die by the supports
[4:52:44] Confidor: Same with a lot of ADCs.. some take abit to come online
[4:52:57] 9fierce9: Do you think its a problem of him being a hyper scaler being dependent on support?
[4:53:00] Confidor: There are safer option adcs for sure like Caitlyn
[4:53:03] PsycheKit: monkaW which senna is it
[4:53:06] PsycheKit: oh the good onbe
[4:53:07] Skrunken: he wouldnt work mid or top would he?
[4:53:08] PsycheKit: thank god
[4:54:53] skeeld: how in the world do you make him work mid
[4:55:02] skeeld: any remotely aggressive laner eats him up
[4:55:08] PsycheKit: @skeeld you just play him like a poke mage
[4:55:18] Confidor: just like you would Kass
[4:55:23] PsycheKit: play safe, farm, poke rather than doing big trades
[4:55:26] skeeld: veigar outranges smolder no?
[4:55:29] skeeld: thats fair tho
[4:55:32] briweb11: 5upWave
[4:55:40] PsycheKit: i think veigar and smolder qs are at similar ranges
[4:55:44] toytrainsgoburr: It’s the same good senna from before 5upHop
[4:55:45] minismile_: @briweb11 hai

[4:55:49] taytayabby: Bri 5upFlower
[4:55:50] PsycheKit: but smolder is pnc while veigar q is a skillshot

[4:56:03] PsycheKit: oh damn
[4:56:07] FreeXe: Senna having Senna name is iconic
[4:56:09] asher_22_16: Bri 5upWave 5upFlower
[4:56:09] Confidor: Veigar can just 1 tap as well
[4:56:12] piveel: hi bri 5up5Crumb
[4:56:15] Gragnoth: that rell was your support last game! lol
[4:56:19] Gragnoth: have fun 5up
[4:56:28] Gragnoth: checking stream out on my phone! :3
[4:56:31] 9fierce9: We got the good senna letsgo
[4:56:35] PsycheKit: @Confidor not in lane really, you need to be midgame for him to explode you and at that stage smolder can also do a lot of burst
[4:56:41] briweb11: soupy tay Asher mini Cari 5upFlower
[4:56:42] Fossabot: 5upFlower 5upFlower 5upFlower
[4:57:08] Confidor: Veigar is imo scarier due to the large AOE stun potential
[4:57:14] PsycheKit: oh 100%
[4:57:26] PsycheKit: baby cage is a much stronger single ability than anything smolder has in his kit imo
[4:57:48] PsycheKit: i think veigar is a worse teamfighter than smolder
[4:57:56] PsycheKit: single target burst is obviously not close
[4:57:59] Confidor: Yea for sure
[4:58:21] Confidor: Viegar destorys 1 person then becomes a supporting role for the rest of the fight
[4:58:41] maedrescher: its the same rell from last game
[4:59:07] Confidor: Be funny if the Rell smurfs on this game XD
[4:59:17] gandalfster: hii, is there a specific reason you take Q later or are you experimenting still?
[5:00:29] chloeiwi: plink
[5:00:59] gandalfster: ahh thats fair i guess it really is better to not hyperfocus on stacks this early when the champ is so easy to bully early
[5:01:06] zinzanish: plink
[5:01:09] VVIZRRD: 2 for 1s are usually good.
[5:01:14] lil__soupy: plink

[5:03:21] 9fierce9: What song is this ?
[5:03:22] briweb11: just realized you and the senna match lol
[5:03:24] VVIZRRD: Built-in escape/kiting is great though.
[5:03:43] Gragnoth: this site sucks, just got out of 6 ads and then it buffered and then gave me 3 more ads…
[5:03:57] gandalfster: @Gragnoth ICANT
[5:04:10] jeskieKAT: AlienDance
[5:04:17] briweb11: that’s the worst when that happens @gragnoth
[5:04:49] NutellaHS: YEET
[5:04:51] VVIZRRD: Outplayed 'em! =D
[5:04:56] 9fierce9: all 3 om
[5:05:03] Gragnoth: lol, it’s w/e thought I was here to watch a stream, I hope watching the ads at least gives 5up some ad revenue
[5:05:55] Cleophi: how much money does cull earn you?
[5:05:56] Gragnoth: would muramana be good on Smolder?
[5:06:23] PsycheKit: @Gragnoth you really dont need the mana but it is genuinely pretty good
[5:06:34] piveel: what is the best sup choice with smolder?
[5:07:15] VVIZRRD: Ez got jukes.
[5:07:37] CassianG: is this mcl practice
[5:08:49] JickyJack: what’s mcl? like the ligament in your knee?
[5:09:12] CassianG: i think thats acl lmaoo

[5:13:03] CassianG: @JickyJack oh damn I didnt know all that
[5:13:07] CassianG: okay biology
[5:15:13] PsycheKit: how fed is this irelia
[5:16:18] VVIZRRD: I've absolutely seen comebacks from way worse and Smolder's scaling seems insane.
[5:17:09] VVIZRRD: 10/18 at 20 minutes is far from insurmountable odds.
[5:17:22] VVIZRRD: Okay 10/20. Still.
[5:17:32] champrath: you should be able to carry this with 225 stacks
[5:17:34] JickyJack: league players don’t know how to relax. perma fight meta
[5:17:52] FreeXe: most of them deafened, no one is seeing wassup
[5:19:28] FreeXe: so what are the stacks giving you?
[5:19:43] PsycheKit: @FreeXe damage on all abilities and execute range on Q
[5:20:00] FreeXe: @FreeXe Alright riot :')
[5:20:34] Paper_Man: ok idk wtf was that
[5:20:38] PsycheKit: shortest cc
[5:20:55] zatyna_: funny interaction
[5:21:43] Sernaaga: stunned cause already in wall
[5:21:46] VVIZRRD: Never seen Poppy's dash take her through a wall.
[5:21:51] zatyna_: poopy e peepoSit
[5:22:06] swirlberry: What song is this?
[5:22:07] skeeld: the fire killing creeps doesnt give you stacks does it
[5:22:27] jeskieKAT: Swirl puppyKISS
[5:22:43] swirlberry: Hi jess!!! catKISS
[5:22:53] swirlberry: I'm on mobile 5upHop
[5:23:24] iauja: u got ori ulted too
[5:23:26] iauja: :c\
[5:23:30] champrath: Senna is fed af
[5:23:30] VVIZRRD: They know you're the priority target.
[5:23:38] Gragnoth: why couldn’t Rell be this good when she was your support?
[5:23:42] maverickx29: Qss angle?
[5:23:44] JickyJack: senna is wild
[5:23:54] PsycheKit: yeah this seems like a merc scim angle to me
[5:24:19] Ambessss: qss does nothing vs rell
[5:24:25] Ambessss: unless u also have flash
[5:25:08] NutellaHS: NotLikeThis
[5:25:10] PsycheKit: ?
[5:25:29] Skrunken: 3-4 sec cc everytime kekw
[5:25:30] Ambessss: dodge her w? NOPE u get pulled in
[5:25:34] JickyJack: lmaooo rell diff
[5:25:34] VVIZRRD: Damn.
[5:25:54] AkitaAttribute: Qss may be the look
[5:26:03] skeeld: i saw the clip, you must have still been technically on the wall
[5:26:11] Paper_Man: u were inside the wall
[5:26:12] VVIZRRD: That Poppy mid-wall interaction seemed scuffed.
[5:26:12] skeeld: so it registered as a stun before kicking you out of the wall
[5:26:34] Ambessss: WAT
[5:26:34] Paper_Man: cause league
[5:26:44] Gragnoth: she flashed to the re-direct
[5:26:46] JickyJack: she flashed
[5:26:49] Mar_Quon: when she changes forms its a pop up
[5:26:51] Gragnoth: look at poppy summoner spell
[5:26:53] Pyronorm: You must have been close enough to the wall for it to register you "hitting" it
[5:26:59] 9fierce9: Is it because youre technically in a wall?
[5:27:13] Gragnoth: ah, I am wrong
[5:27:19] Ambessss: nono just your hitbox already in the wall
[5:27:22] AkitaAttribute: Clense?
[5:27:31] Mar_Quon: rell with 3 ccs
[5:27:31] VVIZRRD: Does that also work against Kayne?
[5:27:38] Ambessss: qss doesn't help
[5:28:01] JickyJack: ‘sorry about smolder’ has me rolling lmaoo
[5:28:02] AkitaAttribute: Yeah that's why the pros run her
[5:28:08] VVIZRRD: A good Rell is absolutely a game changer.
[5:28:09] Ambessss: even if u qss rell has time to w r  you
[5:28:23] Ambessss: yup
[5:28:35] champrath: you cannot evne flash it
[5:28:38] champrath: if she does it right
[5:28:54] skeeld: carrying on this champ feels really hard
[5:28:57] champrath: she presses r before her W lands so you cannot actually flash it
[5:28:59] skeeld: at least for me
[5:29:18] skeeld: low range makes it very hard to position
[5:29:25] Rio_Vella: I don’t know if you guys do this at all but do you raid peoples streams ? my partners streaming right now and I would love to help him any ways I can
[5:29:31] 9fierce9: The TF and Riven tilting didnt help the cause
[5:29:35] azailiaberry: It's me, I seem to curse everyone I watch D:
[5:30:42] cyrus2486: I just started playing league a week ago! Friends got me into it
[5:31:11] 9fierce9: Oh a Zyra support, didnt you say Zyra could be really good with Smoulder
[5:31:16] AsmodeyJM: AsmodeyJM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 41 month streak! 
[5:31:33] DemixelZ: what is the secret to smolder
[5:31:49] Wallibear: @DemixelZ roaring like a dragon when you ult
[5:32:14] skeeld: lowkey i also think hes really comp dependent
[5:32:21] iauja: sure
[5:32:22] 9fierce9: COPIUM
[5:32:24] skeeld: like you go with no enchanters or peels into assassins
[5:32:26] skeeld: and youre just doomed
[5:32:33] Wallibear: ScaredyCat no
[5:32:47] Pyronorm: @skeeld Are there ADCs that don't explode here?
[5:32:53] Vincetw: whats iirc?
[5:32:57] Gragnoth: what is “iirc”?
[5:33:04] auraizen: if i recall correctly
[5:33:04] skeeld: yeah stuff like xayah or lethality carries with range can still play
[5:33:05] 9fierce9: if i recall correctly
[5:33:06] DemixelZ: is there any way to be faster than to go tear er and just spam abilities
[5:33:10] Pyronorm: "If I Recall Correctly"
[5:33:12] Gragnoth: okay
[5:33:17] lavfully: hi walli
[5:33:44] Vincetw: ya you only go oom in the first level maybe then your fine

[5:34:27] DemixelZ: w start for stacks
[5:34:29] DemixelZ: i see you cooking
[5:34:31] AkitaAttribute: Just as a stats item, it's not awful.  But yeah, essence reaver will keep you full mana
[5:35:18] 9fierce9: What is this clown fiesta
[5:35:48] skeeld: its kind of ridiculous how different your mana is before ER and after

[5:37:23] DemixelZ: you arent kiting that much are you?
[5:37:27] AkitaAttribute: I feel like just running tp on ADCs is good.  Less chance of ruined lane with bad jungler
[5:37:28] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[5:37:51] AkitaAttribute: Ghost is combat sum now
[5:37:51] chloeiwi: !mcl
[5:37:59] skeeld: it makes it a lot easier to position and get q's off
[5:38:01] skeeld: without dying
[5:38:12] Pyronorm: If it more important than heal/exh for these rougher laning phases?
[5:38:16] Antfrost: hows smolder been
[5:38:22] chloeiwi: what is mcl?
[5:38:37] Skrunken: do you get the same amount of stacks for all creeps? or do you get more for cannons?
[5:39:12] lavfully: @chloeiwi stands for minectaft league. moba in minecraft, 5up is participating later today
[5:39:48] Antfrost: oh that was um
[5:39:49] Antfrost: interesting
[5:40:37] chloeiwi: @lavfully ty
[5:41:29] VVIZRRD: So the issue isn't with Smolder, it's impatient Supps in the early game.
[5:41:40] BluerBlack: wdym
[5:41:41] jeskieKAT: YEP
[5:41:47] maverickx29: Yes

[5:42:10] superfreak123: mmmm I think he is fine but I think hwei is better
[5:42:13] maverickx29: Tricky navigation early game into obliterating lategame
[5:42:14] Paper_Man: it's not boring cause it's a relatively new champ
[5:42:14] 9fierce9: Boring to watch when you just dont exist in the game
[5:42:23] Skrunken: i like it
[5:42:40] lavfully: entertaining
[5:43:06] interp_tv: zyra doesnt even exist lol

[5:49:46] UnctiousSC: xp gets split between everyone in range, right?
[5:49:49] maverickx29: lgwClap
[5:50:44] Antfrost: zyra left you for that juicy solo xp
[5:50:47] AkitaAttribute: Zyra not in lane
[5:50:50] UnctiousSC: your supp stood out of lane for a while, I'm wondering if that was to boost your lvl
[5:50:54] Gragnoth: solo xp and not dying
[5:50:58] Gragnoth: being in lane longer
[5:51:30] VVIZRRD: I wonder if Smolder could be a good jungle...?
[5:52:26] maverickx29: I dono if u can stack enough, myabe tho?
[5:52:34] XortedI: @VVIZRRD you get way less stacks that way
[5:52:41] pureiinsanity: @VVIZRRD no stacks and no CC for ganks idk what you even see in him
[5:52:46] XortedI: and hes all about the stacks
[5:53:10] KevitoBarajas: do u think smolder is good against early snowball duos? Like if played well and safe with a good zoning but passive support
[5:53:13] VVIZRRD: His page says he gets stacks killing monsters.
[5:53:41] XortedI: brand things...
[5:53:50] maverickx29: With q
[5:54:56] Gragnoth: veig support with smolder? hyper scaling lane? xD
[5:54:57] Antfrost: how good do you think he is with zilean
[5:55:07] pureiinsanity: @VVIZRRD do you know how much less monster kills you get than minion kills?
[5:55:09] maverickx29: dolphinLUL
[5:55:22] NutellaHS: om
[5:55:28] XortedI: that was very questionable
[5:55:33] Antfrost: I wanna run it back I played some more zilean
[5:55:40] Antfrost: I have a better grasp now
[5:55:44] P0WERSTHATBE: if i were jace i would uninstall after that
[5:55:46] Gragnoth: @5up what do you think of Veig support with Smilder adc?
[5:55:51] Gragnoth: smolder*

[5:57:09] BluerBlack: Sometimes I wish lol had voice communication Clueless
[5:57:18] dugy6: wait so whats the secret
[5:57:32] Gragnoth: @pancakesareblue brig gets stacks by hitting enemies with his abilities, that is why veig support works, he doesn’t need to kill minions
[5:57:36] AkitaAttribute: Watch them ff
[5:57:37] pureiinsanity: im surprised you even tried practicing on zilean after that game
[5:57:46] maverickx29: Record is still 20min i think, bust fast stacks still
[5:57:47] Gragnoth: Veig* damn autocorrect
