[6:13:45] BeefCastleLOL: unlucky

[6:14:47] shabladuub: no way
[6:14:50] shabladuub: thats crazy
[6:15:00] Zaisuro: does this kai'sa get the fated top lane ban?

[6:15:05] shabladuub: it looks like my gold games
[6:15:14] dxyf7: wait you have kaisa jungle 🤣
[6:15:42] BeefCastleLOL: @dxyf7 yeah man, its super broken beefca19OKAYDUDE
[6:16:04] Shonji2611: I don't get how people can play Jax, I get he is a good champ but like
[6:16:09] Shonji2611: I'd be bored out of my mind
[6:16:16] Shonji2611: Also I just realized....is that Kaisa jng, wtf?
[6:16:23] thanahtos: the stupid shit is aatrox requires no skill
[6:16:50] DiarShirou: especially with the new items
[6:16:55] shabladuub: is jax hard to beat in high ranks? the only rpoblem i have with him is when he picks phase rush
[6:16:56] Shonji2611: aatrox has always been braindead. His first Q is impossible to miss, Q2 with his E makes it hard to miss.
[6:16:59] yaboyhawkk: full mute auto
[6:17:04] Shonji2611: His Q3 if he lands chain makes it easy
[6:17:48] Unano_D: ^this mf can't move
[6:18:00] Shonji2611: @AutolykusLoL How is the sett into aatrox normally when you don't have an idiot kaisa?
[6:18:51] Shonji2611: I just want 1 meta where Aatrox isn't the best top laner
[6:18:52] thanahtos: tristana and udyr are fed its kind of over
[6:19:05] Shonji2611: He's been basically the best top laner for like 3 seasons
[6:19:45] shabladuub: @Shonji2611 imo in s13 it was skill matchup but now when sett is bad its just aatrox flavored
[6:19:53] yaboyhawkk: sett is in dire need of a buff
[6:20:46] BeefCastleLOL: bro got 1/4th of his health back
[6:20:48] Shonji2611: He was 10% and now hes 60%

[6:21:06] Zaisuro: feel like sunderer was worse
[6:21:21] Shonji2611: Funny thing is, I doubt Riot will buff Sett, since then stupid adc players will cry about how Sett 1 shot them with W
[6:21:26] Shonji2611: And riot caters to adcs
[6:21:31] thatdudejohn62: sett just feels so weak compared to aatrox, Jax and morde I feel
[6:22:02] thanahtos: it wouldnt be that bad if kaisa was a real pick
[6:22:38] Shonji2611: I thought kaisa was mid and diana was jng, at least that is more realistic
[6:22:41] Shonji2611: But Kaisa jng? lol
[6:22:50] PossumPaladin: Aatrox amd Fiora are so gross rn. Also morning Bicep Man
[6:23:20] label939: honestly auto 90% of the champs picked top rn are countered by garen so maybe hes a good champ to pick up
[6:23:38] Shonji2611: LOL he got like 70% hp
[6:23:46] DiarShirou: ah yes
[6:23:52] shabladuub: avengers
[6:23:52] DiarShirou: how balanced with aatrox e and r
[6:24:03] PossumPaladin: They need to buff heal cut
[6:24:10] zaid_2030: hello
[6:24:26] Shonji2611: Aatrox is a riot favorite, they won't do shit to him
[6:24:30] thanahtos: even if your sett and you fall behind in lane theres absolutely nothing you can do anymore after they nerfed hull breaker
[6:24:33] thatdudejohn62: aatrox with new items is op nothing to do with heal cut
[6:24:39] dxyf7: its the broken item
[6:24:57] PossumPaladin: Fair, I'm bad at the game, that's why I watch for advice
[6:25:09] yaboyhawkk: real gigachad dont play meta champs
[6:25:13] thatdudejohn62: riot forcing the same 3-4 champs to be good because “pro play” is so dumb
[6:25:33] zaid_2030: whicj better vs aatrox , sett darius or garen ?
[6:25:40] yaboyhawkk: @zaid_2030 darius
[6:26:05] thanahtos: LUL
[6:27:17] Shonji2611: Imo Garen hard countesr aatrox
[6:27:22] Shonji2611: You stop his entire kit from happening
[6:27:48] thatdudejohn62: I perma aatrox lately
[6:28:14] Zaisuro: i think aatrox worth the ban just for the fatigue
[6:28:43] zaid_2030: with sunderer sky aatrox is immortal xdd

[7:21:00] amiro2000: @thanahtos they buff him cuz stirde was weak
[7:21:09] usuariodedrougas: @shonji2611 4 years in the bag and i suck at garen
[7:21:25] usuariodedrougas: Ngl guys i cannot see the stride changes as a buff
[7:21:59] SleepiEvie: honk
[7:22:00] amiro2000: @usuariodedrougas next patch they making stide into an hydra item
[7:22:10] usuariodedrougas: Not being able go build titanic if you go stride + 300g more expansive for a little damage on the active does not seen a buff to me
[7:22:20] SleepiEvie: olloo
[7:22:28] usuariodedrougas: Im not even trolling i just legit cannot undestand @amiro2000
[7:22:35] SleepiEvie: oh woof the games look cursed
[7:23:34] amiro2000: @usuariodedrougas garen was *weak* when he had 47% in first patch of the season
[7:23:36] thanahtos: @amiro2000 doesnt matter if they nerfed an item why buff a character that has been strong for many seasons now that takes no skills
[7:24:37] usuariodedrougas: @amiro2000 i mean, yeah every fighter lost around 5% wr when the patch came out
[7:25:14] usuariodedrougas: I know its cuz garen cannot proc phaserush with stride anymore (for now) but if its just a garen buff them why even botter?
[7:25:30] amiro2000: @thanahtos ask illaoi when they took away the divine and wall away
[7:26:13] thanahtos: @amiro2000 i can understand illaoi buffs but not one of the best split pushers with phase rush to be buffed
[7:26:47] amiro2000: @usuariodedrougas the reason they buff him cuz hes low elo champion also mostly of new player pick garen KEKW
[7:26:53] usuariodedrougas: @thanahtos riot is just weird, their philosophi is that if a character is strong with a item them they will nerf the character, but if multiple are them they will nerf the item itself
[7:27:39] usuariodedrougas: Yet they desided to nerf essence river and labled it as a rengar nerf insted of, you know NERF RENGAR
[7:28:03] SleepiEvie: next patch is the rengo nerf apparently
[7:28:59] amiro2000: i bet the patch after that they will buff renek cuz hes at 46% wr and have no build KEKW
[7:29:11] amiro2000: and then they buffing  hes item

[7:30:18] Ars0n_: weekend league strikes again
[7:30:20] usuariodedrougas: @amiro2000 hmmmm didnt think about it this way, riot really does brand garen as a begginer champ so it makes sense why the prioratise buffing him
[7:30:28] revoiz88: its ok man bad games at now and then
[7:30:57] usuariodedrougas: God know if he gave auto a competente team he would be to strong

[7:36:13] revoiz88: @usuariodedrougas i dont know but i saw alot of hydra-briar in my games
[7:37:15] usuariodedrougas: @noxiansion i think riot nerfed her lethality builds but her life steal ones are still good from what it seens
[7:37:16] SleepiEvie: Hydra, sundered, steraks apparently is the highest wr build
[7:37:22] SleepiEvie: for briar
[7:37:45] jujalejetodobreachutne: absolute dickhead
