[0:27:44] Amaresu_: Amaresu_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 90s playlist vipeJAM
[0:27:48] SplittingEUW: Yes more boosted players
[0:28:05] SplittingEUW: biggest boosting market = NA server
[0:28:45] wurdone: Also euw most scripters i think and bught accs
[0:28:58] austn00: why is gragas not trying to help with grubs?
[0:28:58] Akaraien: true so many bought accounts in high elo
[0:29:01] Akaraien: atleast 1 per game
[0:29:29] SplittingEUW: All Jokes aside, EUW & NA are similliar in playstyle, the same  except the top 100 of each server
[0:29:36] imibby_: more boosted players means easier games though?
[0:29:52] slaypex11: is the HUD giant or is it just me
[0:29:54] Amaresu_: both euw and na are content servers. all the good players who arent content creators or pro players quit years ago
[0:29:55] Akaraien: @imibby_ not if they are on your team

[0:29:57] Amaresu_: league is dead in the west.
[0:30:08] Kylon1235: no boots :(
[0:30:13] St_Tysek: hwei lives there holy
[0:30:15] imibby_: @akaraien you can only have 4 boosted teammates they can have 5
[0:30:19] SplittingEUW: I believe the top in euw has better midlaners but NA has  some pretty good junglers/supports
[0:30:29] axebodyspray_africa: gragas wp
[0:30:36] Akaraien: @imibby_ not if you are also boosted
[0:30:36] Amaresu_: euw midlaners have been shit for years
[0:30:37] SplittingEUW: Viper proved not so long ago the Top of challenger in NA ladder can compete in EUW
[0:30:41] Amaresu_: they re all mage inflated
[0:30:43] Akaraien: unfortunate
[0:30:46] Amaresu_: none of them played in assassin metas
[0:30:52] Amaresu_: palafox is better than any eu mid
[0:30:56] Amaresu_: (i m european)
[0:31:05] Amaresu_: LCS > LEC for 2 years straight
[0:31:13] Kylon1235: -1
[0:31:18] Drascko: @amaresu_ content creators and shit players keep this game alive, since 95% playerbase is objectively shit
[0:31:34] Akaraien: @Drascko 99%*
[0:31:38] Amaresu_: @Drascko my point was unless you re a streamer or pro player you dont play soloq anymore in the west
[0:31:46] Amaresu_: and game doesnt have new players that actually stick around
[0:31:47] J_Hades1: i guess  better to play in kr  its seems
[0:31:54] Trix3ll: this guy is playing on the NA server and talks about good players LUL just look at this challenger game LUL @Amaresu_
[0:31:57] Amaresu_: cause new player experience is ass and they all give up after a week
[0:32:00] Kylon1235: @Amaresu_ I am still here
[0:32:06] austn00: anitta max wynn
