[0:43:28] xLeSeigneurBalekx: i think double hp shard have more value
[0:44:22] xLeSeigneurBalekx: does the 10% slow téna change something to swifties matchup ?
[0:45:23] xLeSeigneurBalekx: i couldn't find the slow reduce stat in game, idk if it's 10% added or a lower % like ténacity
[0:46:04] xLeSeigneurBalekx: if you build mercury you dont get 10% flat added for exemple
[0:46:12] xLeSeigneurBalekx: but idk if it's the same for swifties boots
[0:47:18] Swishndis: avery, could also be an option, with sorc buff

[1:47:35] Swishndis: perhaps you can just take the tenacity rune vs nasus, and swifties - nasus seem weak

[2:11:19] KINGMASTERPIMP69: the correct build is to play trundle and os towers
[2:12:35] nucularspider: they mad at mundo after that
[2:14:21] Lazynameross: in what world is janna bad pick here
[2:15:28] Frothyy: I don't think she does much in lane but overall seems like a good 15+ min pick

[2:16:24] Lazynameross: baron has arrived
[2:16:52] Lazynameross: so if zac was in the bush just then, would he have seen the red buff zoom over to teemo while he was invis?

[2:25:43] Lazynameross: teemo is the solo ap vs 2 tanks
[2:25:51] Lazynameross: and akshan doesnt seem to play his champ
[2:26:13] DCraven_0ne: janah pushing her away from you was not ideal either
[2:26:15] Lazynameross: playing for him isnt crazy move if thats really what happened, i got here late
[2:27:48] Pitju99: senna dmg RIOT
[2:28:04] DontFeedPenguins: bot lost the game
[2:28:44] 514484: as usual
[2:28:56] Lazynameross: shes specifically built to deal dmg tho
[2:29:09] Frothyy: So what was the deal with akshan ulting full hp people as an opener. Does it armor shred or something.
[2:29:35] Lazynameross: i dont remember what he does but i think r has execute dmg in there
[2:29:44] Pitju99: @lazynameross she still has giga slows, a root and a shielding ulti
[2:29:50] Lazynameross: not sure if anything else
[2:30:12] Lazynameross: yeah she does but shes still an adc at the end of the day
