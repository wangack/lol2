[0:10:36] TomJokr: TomJokr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months, currently on a 52 month streak! ooo time for some definitely not spyro gameplay
[0:10:45] rythmicleague: @rickyfloptok Hes not op but hes a hyper scaling champ that relies on stacks similar to veigar and asol.
[0:10:48] ChaosHK: or at least Nemesis was getting some crazy good games with smolder mid
[0:10:55] hazeatnight: Hi Taco!
[0:11:01] flicc02: El sondito lmfao
[0:11:15] Patrik0726: how‚Äôs jhin this patch?
[0:11:32] rythmicleague: @Patrik0726 the players are iffy.
[0:11:37] rickyfloptok: Adc realiant on stacks? Oh god

[0:12:29] Csarkaiser1: T T
[0:12:36] Patrik0726: this champ is so cute ngl xd
[0:12:36] Nadermeister: Karma hit so hard and so fast :D
[0:12:38] Nadermeister: KEKW
[0:12:43] MihaiOSS: should you focus on getting stacks by poking or farming in the early game?
[0:12:45] ChaosHK: them mana issues tho
[0:12:46] Csarkaiser1: Moooooom they killed him!
[0:12:57] ChaosHK: farm with Q, poke with W
[0:13:09] ChaosHK: although poking with Q works as well before the aoe
[0:13:28] imora702: how's smolder so far?
[0:13:40] MihaiOSS: catJAM
[0:13:45] ChaosHK: W exploding on champs makes it really good for stacks, specially when the game turns ARAM
[0:13:59] Patrik0726: are u going to finish ur tear item or just sell it late game
[0:14:04] Soupman456: what up taco n chat lurkk
[0:14:06] imora702: i was considering trying it mid if my fizz gets banned. not sure how viable it is though.
[0:14:19] ChaosHK: better than bot at least
[0:14:45] ChaosHK: mages (Syndra) will gave you trouble
[0:14:45] ScarlyScars: Nice!!
[0:14:46] MihaiOSS: LETSGO

[0:15:34] rickyfloptok: Mom's tired let her rest
[0:15:53] ChaosHK: basically ez, yeah
[0:16:19] ChaosHK: although smolder likes crit (er navori) more than ez (who can go tri shojin)
[0:16:33] ChaosHK: nothing crazy, but still
[0:16:33] MihaiOSS: I love smolders design, he is a silly silly boy widepeepoCute
[0:17:15] khangnile: @IKeepItTaco what do you think about W 2nd max? Saber was doing it to get stacks faster
[0:17:40] ChaosHK: Saber was doing the 3 points in W early as well
[0:17:51] ChaosHK: with doran's ring as well
[0:19:10] Repsis: u go comet and dring as well
[0:19:14] 7uNo77: nemesis did the same
[0:19:20] 7uNo77: waveclear, poke and stacks
[0:19:31] ChaosHK: ^
[0:19:43] veileen_: 120 stacks on 14 min. Huge
[0:20:08] BootyPlonk: hey taco im wondering why is ER better than TF on smolder?
[0:20:14] 7uNo77: neme always 225 stacks around 20 minutes ish with maxing W
[0:20:28] 7uNo77: Hmm
[0:20:35] MeerTwT: w 3points then max q and go mana flow band
[0:20:41] zinoDrizz: he also went shadowflame
[0:20:42] MeerTwT: slow and stacks faster
[0:21:37] iv0_____: @zinoDrizz first item?
[0:21:47] ChaosHK: Milio POG
[0:21:50] zinoDrizz: na not firrst
[0:21:50] Nightbot: dogshit kerfuckle perma clowning around throwing shit at each other, APES TOGETHER STRONG
[0:22:33] neurotickl: hello taco, how goes the smoldering?
[0:22:35] Csarkaiser1: 5
[0:22:44] MeerTwT: 3
[0:22:45] orluas: no you 3 points w then you max q
[0:22:52] Csarkaiser1: Sadge
[0:22:55] Csarkaiser1: Five
[0:23:03] ChaosHK: three points. Level 1, 4 and 5
[0:23:11] twirlypanda: actually you only level e until 6, little known tech
[0:23:18] Csarkaiser1: Nightbot won't scold me T T
[0:23:37] orluas: you are using the 3 points & dorans ring for poking and helping w his laning phase
[0:23:45] TheFlamingTiger357: all that for crab T_T
[0:23:49] orluas: since his w has relatively good ap scaling
[0:24:01] 7uNo77: pogg lets go
[0:24:06] Dubatt0: yo is me
[0:24:06] ChaosHK: 100% ap (total) on W, pretty nuts
[0:24:08] lethalbonsai: smolder millio is a great duo i think
[0:24:23] NecatorIV: Hello guys ikeepitHEY
[0:24:24] lethalbonsai: ms extra range shield heal
[0:24:33] midourikawa: millio is good with everyone, the most broken support
[0:24:34] MihaiOSS: xdding
[0:24:35] mouadce137: does extra range work with his Q ??
[0:24:45] veileen_: He is so happy when dont play bot Stronge
[0:24:50] ChaosHK: Q range is your atk range, so RFC an milio work
[0:24:53] MrSkyRQ: whats the best way to stack his passsive? and not wait 30 mins
[0:24:56] 7uNo77: i think its very usefull
[0:24:59] mouadce137: @ChaosHK ok ty
[0:24:59] akaneshi: milio is truly broken
[0:25:07] Greninjafr09: your mom chose the right idea, Sup taco
[0:25:14] twirlypanda: frozen heart draven YEP
[0:25:33] gg_pentacles: @IKeepItTaco try next game when you have 25 stacks go to voidgrugs and stack for free
[0:25:46] ChaosHK: best way to stack his passive is to A) manage the wave well (last hit as much as possible with Q) and b ) sneeze on the enemy, non stop boogers
[0:26:23] MrSkyRQ: @ChaosHK sounds like a plan
[0:26:27] lethalbonsai: in 5 hours my chat restriction ends ^^
[0:26:30] dytnos: hi Im the first time here, I watched allot of ur youtube videos and I thought I follow u on twitch, when u were offline. I realy enjoy ur content, thx so much

[0:28:02] 7uNo77: lucian refusing to get carried
[0:28:17] 7uNo77: main character syndrome
[0:28:22] ChaosHK: chicken stacks
[0:28:23] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Why are previous couple broadcast are not saved?
[0:28:54] ChaosHK: 24 minute 225, not bad
[0:28:54] Megabooy1: @veileen_ Interesting I will have to keep an eye out for it than ;)
[0:29:11] Csarkaiser1: @ikeepittaco what happens if you play as Smolder against Sylas?
[0:29:27] ChaosHK: Uhh
[0:29:35] SaltedIIIBlueberries: I feel like smolder passive scaling abit weal
[0:29:47] orluas: milio seems like his best support tbh
[0:29:47] Csarkaiser1: Hihihi just teasing
[0:29:48] ChaosHK: yeah, Sylas versus Smolder feels wrong LUL
[0:29:56] Csarkaiser1: Ikr
[0:30:16] ChaosHK: Daddy Sylas xddWalk
[0:30:18] dytnos: how much mana do ur abilities cost?
[0:30:25] SaltedIIIBlueberries: He is more like dmg over time champ instead of burst adc.
[0:30:30] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Ohh
[0:30:34] lethalbonsai: @SaltedIIIBlueberries yeah
[0:30:34] evasivecube43: so we can say smolder mid is healthy for mental?
[0:30:39] Dokura_Paira: respect
[0:30:42] lethalbonsai: he is for long fights
[0:30:50] ScarlyScars: Fair enough

[0:33:37] evasivecube43: dam support player have zero chill
[0:34:01] jrdi__: yo
[0:34:15] ChaosHK: Support streamers are the chillest role, but then I drop into an adc streamer and the demons come out EYESZOOM
[0:34:16] SuaveADC: all millio had to say was sry i thought u were dead even if i R god damn
[0:34:20] veileen_: *I did my job here*
[0:34:22] SquidSquaaad: Likes to sing, eh?

[0:35:52] ennosigaeum: is essence river better than trinity? @IKeepItTaco
[0:35:59] veileen_: Playing mid is fun for you - that's why it's fun to watch. Idk why you keep return to bot. Hope Challandger soon
[0:35:59] MeerTwT: @saltediiiblueberries is weak cuz late is so op so is scalling
[0:36:04] Qerivan: hey there are there any smolder  impressions vid or smt?
[0:36:11] 7uNo77: smolder mid is so fun to play and to watch taco FeelsOkayMan

[0:36:47] SaltedIIIBlueberries: @meertwt I still couldn't carry even with 22kills
[0:36:56] cristiz23: did u play smolder?
[0:37:06] Faramir1993: it helps u with u weak lane phase
[0:37:06] ChaosHK: Saber goes with comet (for poke), Nemesis goes for fleet (so he doesn't die)
[0:37:14] ChaosHK: both do the doran's 3w KR strat
[0:37:17] orluas: arcane comet is the same idea with the w poke for stacks and better laning phase thats been going around
[0:37:17] SaltedIIIBlueberries: With 367 stacks
[0:37:25] MeerTwT: because w apply slow so can‚Äôt miss comet
[0:37:32] majoralexlol: What about harvest?
[0:37:37] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Dark harvest?
[0:37:40] MattKolba: And neme uses tp too
[0:37:44] schemeeee: saber ended up switching to fleet at end of his stream and liked it way better
[0:38:02] orluas: not max w, 3 point then q max
[0:38:05] Has_a_twitch: what makes ranged solo ranged laners strong is fleet
[0:38:06] ChaosHK: is there much we want in the red tree to go DH?
[0:38:42] MeerTwT: @saltediiiblueberries smolder is a fun kite champ u can‚Äôt stay auto like others adc
[0:39:04] MeerTwT: but when ur over 225 stacks ur so online with the execute burn
[0:39:12] MeerTwT: but even then u have to kite
[0:39:20] HilariBarbae: Smolder gameplay?

[0:43:32] Faramir1993: i should ask by friend about genshin drama he play it

[1:09:51] veileen_: @IEasyAce He is toxic pretty often. Dont like this guy
[1:09:59] peshecito: Kaisa SMILERS
[1:10:10] MattKolba: I think is normal for the adc going mid after laning phase, and you can't do anything against them, they will go mid, is annoying, but with tp you can have more stacks as smolder
[1:10:15] Azonaj: @ChaosHK ap kaisa build

[1:15:45] MangekyoZed: lmao I hate this season. literally every placement game has been the same. Super fed ap/assasin champ insta kills you and you cant do shit
[1:15:56] ChaosHK: 225 stacks your Q burns for true damage and executes players with low HP
[1:15:57] ArrowQuiver: 225, stacks after increase the execute threshol
[1:16:10] ApheliosTheFaithful: if tf ult to cancel back they would won
[1:16:19] ChaosHK: the burn is 6% (IIRC) over 3 seconds, execute is 2% + 1 per 40 stacks
[1:16:21] mr1bru: thanks
[1:16:42] ChaosHK: but we have elder anyways I guess LUL

[1:26:20] johnadam131994: Stop lying he sucked to me
[1:26:22] Aura_Jakkaru: smolder is balanced
[1:26:36] Aura_Jakkaru: hes not overdone or weak
[1:26:40] jhinxed1: well that last two plays you did was bad tho
[1:26:43] Kiliut: smolder is super strong just need a little brain from your team
[1:26:45] veileen_: @Aura_Jakkaru He is
[1:26:48] mensch10: you think adc smolder sucks?
[1:26:50] ChaosHK: most support players aren't really engage plaeyrs, but maokai is 'broken' right now, so... You get wiseTree
[1:26:53] johnadam131994: Okay you didnt get the joke
[1:26:55] Komlin111: first champ since forever who hasnt been hotfixed
[1:26:55] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D

[1:27:26] Aura_Jakkaru: played games 2 of smolder bot and was like nah im staying mid
[1:27:27] johnadam131994: He just takes too long to scale
[1:27:28] Aura_Jakkaru: feels way better
[1:27:38] johnadam131994: Even kassadin and kayle take less time to scale
[1:27:46] onesharpblade_: I hope you better next game FallWinning
[1:28:18] Aura_Jakkaru: if you're csing properly and ur team isnt trolling you, you can "scale" before 25 mins
[1:28:19] johnadam131994: Thank you

[1:28:53] Komlin111: kayle/nasus are just dependent on enemy champs, free farm = faster scale
[1:28:55] RefiixGaming: Play smolder, Kayle, kassadin, belveth and senna let's go
[1:29:01] llzekall: He has insane AOE dmg
[1:29:04] jhinxed1: smolder scales well, those are saying shit about smolder is coz they suck at the game

[1:29:31] onesharpblade_: Why is everyone saying it‚Äôs bad?
[1:29:52] ChaosHK: yeah, smolder is MUCH better if your support understands the champion LUL
[1:29:59] mensch10: So how was dorans Ring?
[1:29:59] Kiliut: i mean we won bot hard and even the one we lost we scaled a lot better
[1:30:09] Komlin111: does he need lifesteal/attack speed cus his range is so low?
[1:30:29] NomadNoah: What's good Taco, hope you're chillin
[1:30:31] SaltedIIIBlueberries: smolders is okay the issues here smolders is damage over time champ not a burst, you need team that can stay alive to you spit out damage
[1:30:32] onesharpblade_: Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself. I know you‚Äôre gonna do better !
[1:30:37] confettipenguin: He's a scaler, meaning he has to play safe, how hard is tht to understand

[1:31:59] Komlin111: true I saw a version of that with yorick
[1:32:00] ChaosHK: Someone needs to photoshop a Maokai into that stick

[1:32:47] onesharpblade_: Brand/Smolder is op
[1:32:54] ChaosHK: I'd say 'kog'maw', but tbh... I forgot that kog'maw existed
[1:32:56] SaltedIIIBlueberries: @TopKeks_senpai123 more like 2-3 shot
[1:33:07] TopKeks_senpai123: @ChaosHK playing jinx in current season is just asking for LP loss
[1:33:28] twitchpatrulis: where is four bro?
[1:33:38] NgeNiousSK: @ChaosHK Lethality jinx actually hits pretty hard

[1:34:15] Klony99: Yeah they don't see it that way. Like most 15 year old League players.
[1:34:18] NomadNoah: people are so shocked when pick order lets people pick in order LMAO
[1:34:23] SteveAlanB: bruh i just wanna burn my points
[1:34:24] SaltedIIIBlueberries: he could just ask?
[1:34:34] ChaosHK: top lane is like the most brutal lane and people want to take a child there? LUL
[1:34:48] twitchpatrulis: smolder useless champion

[1:37:04] twitchpatrulis: canon no way
[1:37:22] wwaterbearer: if youre so much better go play on ur account and stream it; no one cares about ur toxic commentary.
[1:37:30] SteveAlanB: man this corki must've played vs so many smolders already
[1:37:35] SteveAlanB: he's spacing taco so well
[1:37:39] NgeNiousSK: Oh ur going ap,just noticed LUL i was like why the fuck is he maxing W first
[1:37:46] ChaosHK: KR strat
[1:37:55] ChaosHK: start AP, 180 into AD
[1:37:58] nfzeta: is he actually going ap or just starting dorans?
[1:37:58] ChaosHK: wtf
[1:38:09] ChaosHK: just starting dorans and dark seal
[1:38:10] NgeNiousSK: @nfzeta Look his ap
[1:38:16] pinguino_sensei: dam he was fast
[1:38:16] ChaosHK: buyt where the F did knifecat come from
[1:38:23] Eldamil: is ezreal top a troll pick or is that a thing nowadays
[1:38:32] SteveAlanB: @ChaosHK flashed over bird wall
[1:38:33] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK that was just from the runes and ring
[1:38:38] NgeNiousSK: @Eldamil Troll 100%,that shit ain¬¥t good on top
[1:38:41] fixbones: is this smolder ap?
[1:38:45] ChaosHK: Oh, bird wall is that side, right, got my sides mixed up
[1:38:53] the17thshadow: As a joke, have you ever played SMITE?
[1:38:55] Eldamil: @NgeNiousSK thought so, feels bad man ikeepitRAREHANDS
[1:39:02] NgeNiousSK: @nfzeta Yeah but why would you buy dark seal on adc hampion
[1:39:08] Aura_Jakkaru: xdd
[1:39:14] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK i was pretty much already typing before he bought it
[1:39:28] ChaosHK: Zac players need to learn they can use the skill shot on the minion and then auto attack the champ
[1:39:32] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK that's why i said ring in my reply
[1:39:49] SteveAlanB: @ChaosHK while u are absolutely correct and a lot of zacs get that wrong, i think this time corki was out of aa range
[1:39:52] NgeNiousSK: @nfzeta Also maxing W first,i mean why would do that on ad build
[1:39:58] twitchpatrulis: @saltediiiblueberries just close yours eyea when iam typing bro no ones speak with you
[1:40:01] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK wave clear early in mid lane
[1:40:10] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK these sorts of builds have happened before
[1:40:12] SaltedIIIBlueberries: @twitchpatrulis edgyy
[1:40:28] reb0rn_o: corki is whoopin ur lil ass
[1:40:29] ChaosHK: hmm, looked like corki was barely in range, but I guess you can't be too sure
[1:40:36] SaltedIIIBlueberries: mr is coping
[1:40:36] ChaosHK: g-zus fuck
[1:40:42] Aura_Jakkaru: ez check deposit
[1:40:54] ChaosHK: I know R has a 100% ap (130% in the middle), but Mom cooked the cat
[1:40:55] onesharpblade_: @twitchpatrulis you‚Äôre embarrassing yourself. Grow up brother
[1:41:04] twitchpatrulis: @saltediiiblueberries iam not edgy just joking bro why u so mad
[1:41:34] SaltedIIIBlueberries: that's is bad joke.
[1:41:53] SteveAlanB: chat can u take it into dms please
[1:42:06] twitchpatrulis: @saltediiiblueberries Bro just don‚Äôt read my message that‚Äôs all is not hard i thing
[1:42:14] pinguino_sensei: i love your playlist teco
[1:42:26] nfzeta: so is it ap first into ad or is that sheen for lich bane?
[1:42:31] twitchpatrulis: @stevealanb with this guy nobody one

[1:42:36] SaltedIIIBlueberries: @twitchpatrulis k, blocked
[1:42:41] olioxe: MOOOM
[1:42:48] confuseddracaena: mom?
[1:42:49] Aura_Jakkaru: where tf go
[1:42:51] nfzeta: kk thx @ChaosHK
[1:42:52] ChaosHK: there's prolly an viable AP build (which begins with lich bane 100%), but haven't seen that
[1:42:59] westiful: MOOM
[1:43:02] MysticMachia: MOOOOOOM
[1:43:03] NapNapoleon: There's an argument for running TP honestly.
[1:43:05] RatCoffee: what is that eye of sauron thing
[1:43:10] ChaosHK: TF ult
[1:43:17] nfzeta: @NapNapoleon yea in the stats tp does pretty good
[1:43:27] chipichipichapachapagr: GET HIMM
[1:43:32] ChaosHK: reveal everyone + 4~5k range TP monkaSTEER
[1:43:34] ArrowQuiver: i think smolder could do hybrid build with liandry 3rd item
[1:43:47] nfzeta: I think a shojin after ER could be good
[1:43:47] ArrowQuiver: stack the burn on Q
[1:43:48] Komlin111: üêñ
[1:43:54] SaltedIIIBlueberries: southeast asian here, its funny how you also use pig as a slur lmaoo
[1:43:58] orbrhino: oink oink is now added to my list of insults lol
[1:43:59] NgeNiousSK: @ArrowQuiver Why,his 225 Q is literally just liandry on crack
[1:44:07] ChaosHK: ER Navori into Liandry sounds cursed AND viable at the same time LUL
[1:44:14] WizardPug: ruh roh
[1:44:18] wwaterbearer: oh i thought taco was just talking the ezreal's language
[1:44:22] wwaterbearer: since thats what he spoke in first lmaoooo
[1:44:31] ArrowQuiver: @NgeNiousSK exactly double burn and % bbonus dmg
[1:44:56] ArrowQuiver: and the burn resets on Q burn tick
[1:45:08] NgeNiousSK: @ArrowQuiver But why,it¬¥s so redundant and waste of slot for actual good item,if it was last season liandry then sure but not this
[1:45:22] ChaosHK: if I had to guess an AP smolder build... Lich Bane, Liandry into Shadowflame. No AH, tho, not sure I like that part
[1:45:23] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK stacking on strengths of a champ is how most builds work
[1:45:27] ArrowQuiver: this season liandry is hella strong tho
[1:45:36] Aura_Jakkaru: 1 hps
[1:45:59] wwaterbearer: sera is landing pretty good ultis to help u tho

[1:46:42] kingrichardddddd: 225 stacks and u win
[1:46:47] ChaosHK: well, he is fucked because he picked ez, but still
[1:46:47] RumRum: average league experience amirite?
[1:46:47] SaltedIIIBlueberries: ezreal suprise pikachu face when you picks your declared champ after he gives you first pick
[1:46:48] nfzeta: If riot ever had people actually watching games that got the griefing report these people would get banned so easy
[1:46:49] wwaterbearer: so it should be winnable :3
[1:46:53] final_zangetsu: @i0ki screw you ioki i still remember that one guy you ran down and gave up in 5 min on your smurf
[1:46:53] nfzeta: Even if it was just for high elo
[1:46:58] NarwhalBert: @IKeepItTaco been trying to play smolder all day cause its so fun but im getting insulted and griefed in champ selecta already almost every game. real taxing man. nice to chill in your stream and learn to unwind @IKeepItTaco

[1:48:15] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK the point was the burn stacking and he does have some ap ratios. Every q and e hit would proc. That's not to say it would be good but to talk about redundancy is not it

[1:49:39] NgeNiousSK: @nfzeta But it is redundant,It¬¥s like building banshee¬¥s on malzahar,you can but why would you
[1:49:42] NarwhalBert: @IKeepItTaco i tried mid and ad. mid feels better just because you are your own master. as you say too
[1:49:54] RumRum: i had 6 dodged games earlier because i locked in smolder, had my jgl at one point troll and grief because he couldnt have smolder jgl @IKeepItTaco

[1:50:26] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK that's like asking why you would go liandry on teemo because his poison is already a dot
[1:50:49] wwaterbearer: Anyway has bot caught up?
[1:50:54] StormyGlormy: Craziest thing, is most times the same people acting like this are full grown adults.
[1:51:03] Kynshassa: Its always impressive to me when people who are this toxic make it to high elos
[1:51:05] NarwhalBert: @IKeepItTaco laning doesn^t even feel that bad if you're left 1v1. especially with comet+w start

[1:52:19] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK but again why would they build mr early against an ad champ, the rest of the build is still ad
[1:52:26] TTwisterxD: no GigaChad
[1:52:29] McNutHead: i feel... cheated.... joined the stream, got an ad... ok, i can deal... 1 second after the 30 second ad ends, got another 30 second ad
[1:52:46] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK that's the main strength of hybrid builds, hard to build resists against them
[1:52:53] NgeNiousSK: @nfzeta Probably because 3 champ on your team are ap? it¬¥s useless no matter how you look at it
[1:53:12] nfzeta: @NgeNiousSK lol so you're imagining a comp just to support that argument?
[1:53:28] Kynshassa: Honestly Im expecting some tweaks for smolder in the future to make his early game a lil easier
[1:53:32] SaltedIIIBlueberries: classic ezreal L
[1:53:35] olioxe: he ulted the wave...
[1:53:35] SteveAlanB: i found that the best way to not get ads is to move to a country where nobody wants to pay for them...
[1:53:46] SaltedIIIBlueberries: @olioxe he didnt even get the caster
[1:54:24] menniphi: good luck
[1:54:26] nfzeta: @SteveAlanB I'm way ahead of u on that strat
[1:54:42] i0ki: AD TF is so putrid
[1:54:44] NgeNiousSK: @nfzeta Isn¬¥t that how most comps are? i mean going full is literally asking to lose
[1:54:49] nfzeta: @SteveAlanB then again not necessarily
[1:54:52] AslanTheRengar: wild rengar used Q

[1:55:32] johnadam131994: Ezreal stole baron btw
[1:55:33] Royfor: ezreal did something
[1:55:35] wwaterbearer: and stay close to the carries when rengar ults

[1:57:08] nfzeta: I've especially seen people do that chasing the enemy adc when it just enables them to pop off
[1:57:32] Jereaa: the monster is inmortal
[1:57:39] wwaterbearer: does sera have zhonyas?

[1:58:47] Aura_Jakkaru: 50 stacks off just cho
[1:58:58] ChaosHK: well, W gives us a fuck ton of stacks for one
[1:59:00] Aura_Jakkaru: @CictorGabriel slow
[1:59:03] nfzeta: @CictorGabriel it's a pretty good slow and does okay damage if you pop on multiple champs
[1:59:05] ChaosHK: and does damage to things not called cho
[1:59:08] NgeNiousSK: @CictorGabriel Slow

[1:59:44] wwaterbearer: they won that fight overall
[1:59:47] wwaterbearer: by being patient
[1:59:54] johnadam131994: Shield bow is great for rengar
[1:59:55] nfzeta: ^
[2:00:17] wwaterbearer: taco overall right still

[2:01:22] wwaterbearer: ah
[2:01:23] wwaterbearer: right
[2:01:26] ChaosHK: Kindred is JGL
[2:01:28] CictorGabriel: Nasus, Bel'Veth, Veigar, Smolder, Senna
[2:01:31] ChaosHK: also Bel
[2:01:32] johnadam131994: Corki package
[2:01:38] wwaterbearer: kindred?
[2:01:40] zeref_lol: Is smolder weak
[2:01:43] nfzeta: sion also technically counts
[2:01:43] Aura_Jakkaru: kindred has a cap tho
[2:01:48] ChaosHK: she has?
[2:01:48] wwaterbearer: oh shit really?
[2:01:52] nfzeta: ^
[2:02:02] ChaosHK: TBH I forgot Bel so I defaulted to Kindred LUL
[2:02:06] wwaterbearer: same

[2:03:48] ToneDoLOL: btw Kissahomie to all of you
[2:03:54] Jereaa: Chatting
[2:04:06] Komlin111: I feel like botrk would be strong on him but then youd lose crit early
[2:04:16] Komlin111: ye
[2:04:18] wwaterbearer: kindred
[2:04:26] wwaterbearer: we were talking about infinite scaling champs in every role
[2:04:27] Aura_Jakkaru: kindred attack range boost caps at 725
[2:04:34] Aura_Jakkaru: 705*
[2:04:37] wwaterbearer: does senna range cap?
[2:04:38] Aura_Jakkaru: 750* god i cant type
[2:04:42] ChaosHK: Kindred doesn't have Senna privillege Kappa
[2:04:45] wwaterbearer: or can u legit just get a spotter and go to town?
[2:05:03] ChaosHK: last I checked Senna could, theorically, go infinite
[2:05:03] Kynshassa: I still think a smolder tweak is incoming to help his early game
[2:05:12] ThatProgrammingDude: senna has no cap i think
[2:05:16] nfzeta: yea I missed that the range does have a cap
[2:05:28] Aura_Jakkaru: there was a tweet earlier today about theyre unsure about what to do with smolder
[2:05:36] nfzeta: range stops increasing after 25 marks
[2:05:40] Aura_Jakkaru: hes seemingly "fine" atm
[2:05:55] ChaosHK: Smolder has no cap either, although at some point his Q just become a ring of death LUL
[2:06:02] mr_kimon: YOOOOOOOOOOOO GM TACOOO

[2:06:38] mr_kimon: whats up taco hope u feel well
[2:06:50] nfzeta: yea the stacks still infinitely scale for the w and e
[2:06:58] Kynshassa: I like the idea of Smolder but I think he takes way too long to come online, and its too easy to fall behind
[2:07:00] orca848: is bring me the horizon or caskets on the list sir?
[2:07:07] destkasvl: ty for nothing but thieves in playlist i really like ur music taste

[2:08:34] zeusdemoon: @IKeepItTaco u like EyeDress
[2:08:37] zeusdemoon: ?

[2:25:20] Komlin111: viego when he kills gangplank
[2:25:39] ToneDoLOL: sheen kinda bad first buy tho
[2:26:00] ChaosHK: extra damage on the Q, including explosion. Welps with farming
[2:26:03] nfzeta: Really want to see Taco try a shojin build
[2:26:12] limpinggamer: what item build are u going?
[2:26:21] NarwhalBert: wait i haven't confirmed that yet. you can stack on voidemite grubs right @IKeepItTaco
[2:26:22] Aura_Jakkaru: for smolder i pray for sheen first
[2:26:42] ToneDoLOL: at least for me adc i dont like
[2:26:47] ChaosHK: apparently the mites in the pit don't give stacks, no exploit there
[2:26:54] zeusdemoon: idk i really need to that bubble to be come back like ahris one
[2:26:57] Aura_Jakkaru: they used to on pbe
[2:27:08] flicc02: This team, good fkn synergy
[2:27:20] ChaosHK: I guess devs realized the perma farm strat and nerfed LUL
[2:27:29] nfzeta: nah sheen the best early buy for smolder. Ad encourages a form of play he's not good at
[2:27:45] ChaosHK: Sheen sounds good for last hiting with Q if anything
[2:27:58] nfzeta: also poke and short trades
[2:28:01] Shagidzun: is doran ring really better than doran blade?
[2:28:03] BigManAlexx_: @IKeepItTaco thoguhts on rfc second?
[2:28:07] chipichipichapachapagr: i saw a trinity smolder today and he did well
[2:28:11] nfzeta: which is all you should be doing early until you have an engage supp and a low enemy
[2:28:11] ChaosHK: doran ring is legit
[2:28:17] ChaosHK: mana regen, damage on W
[2:28:24] ToneDoLOL: still fight xdd
[2:28:30] NarwhalBert: @Shagidzun dorans ring together with some points in w feel very good for early laning
[2:28:38] sk33tlejuice: is doran viable start for bot with the little qt dragon?
[2:28:46] Shagidzun: thanks chat
[2:28:53] ChaosHK: this strat works bot as well (3 points w with doran)
[2:29:09] ChaosHK: the OG strat (KR of course) was done bot, with comet as well
[2:29:14] ToneDoLOL: Pog
[2:29:14] juletta1_: MOOOM
[2:29:17] bluerazor123: that ult looks op
[2:29:17] Komlin111: rat kabobs
[2:29:34] ToneDoLOL: MOOOM called
[2:29:41] NarwhalBert: w start and up to 3 points in w then switch to q seems opimal in many cases
[2:29:52] nfzeta: two nice shutdowns
[2:29:54] ToneDoLOL: Pog
[2:30:02] ChaosHK: almost killed karma LUL
[2:30:07] ChaosHK: but hey, 1 w 4 stacks
[2:30:21] nfzeta: dark seal stacks :D
[2:30:27] ToneDoLOL: 67 ap Pog
[2:30:33] NarwhalBert: best feeling. lvl 1 enemy invade giving 5 stacks with w
[2:31:01] nfzeta: also a good bit of damage because it works like hwei's passive and the explosions stack
[2:31:01] nyxionite: Hey Taco and chat
[2:31:21] Komlin111: weroreSit
[2:31:32] ChaosHK: if they do buff smolder... getting  the second upgrade slightly earlier (125 -> 100) would be nice I think
[2:31:34] SpellRegent: more like 10, not 5
[2:31:40] ToneDoLOL: MOOOM
[2:31:41] juletta1_: MOOOM  Û†ÄÄ
[2:31:48] Sakyn: BabyRage MOOOOOOOM
[2:31:55] Skaftoise: MOM?!?!
[2:32:02] ToneDoLOL: modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW
[2:32:03] NarwhalBert: MOOOOM!
[2:32:05] ChaosHK: W wording does make it sound like it should give 2 stacks (explosion + booger)
[2:32:13] ToneDoLOL: modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW
[2:32:24] nfzeta: yea if only, would help a lot if you played for trades more @ChaosHK
[2:32:27] LuchiiLoL: what is his stacks ?
[2:32:35] ChaosHK: RIOT please
[2:32:43] ramisaffour: thank god taco does not live with his parents , his mom would be running around to his room everytime he screams MOOOM
[2:32:44] Aura_Jakkaru: 112
[2:32:47] ChaosHK: fix your champ LUL
[2:32:51] nfzeta: but if the explosion gave stacks it would prob be op since each explosion would proc stacks for however many champs it hit
[2:33:14] ChaosHK: fair enough RAGEY
[2:33:35] Osloares: wew
[2:33:37] SpellRegent: Karma OP
[2:33:40] ramisaffour: mom missed
[2:34:21] ToneDoLOL: modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW
[2:34:32] Cata_110: The ult deal ramate only in the center?
[2:34:35] flicc02: MOM EMOTE
[2:34:42] Cata_110: Damage
[2:34:45] ChaosHK: extra damage in the middle
[2:34:48] ChaosHK: plus the slow
[2:34:56] Cata_110: Ty
[2:34:57] lener311: @flicc02 its a need
[2:34:59] LordGatoMeow: is that a dota mouse pad?
[2:35:03] juletta1_: MOOOM
[2:35:03] ToneDoLOL: Pog
[2:35:04] sk33tlejuice: love mom
[2:35:06] ToneDoLOL: modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW
[2:35:06] Shagidzun: @Cata_110 more dmg in the middle like sett's w
[2:35:07] ToneDoLOL: modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW modCheck MODS NEED MOOM EMOTE NOW
[2:35:18] bluerazor123: wait the ult is his mom?????
[2:35:24] ChaosHK: get in the herald
[2:35:27] Meeso_bb: naut did not do anything wrong
[2:35:28] lener311: @bluerazor123 cute, no?
[2:35:29] ChaosHK: nevermind
[2:35:32] bluerazor123: yeah
[2:35:45] Shagidzun: mom sky, literally
[2:36:17] GreenMamb4: Imagine Sylas stealing his mom
[2:36:20] Sakyn: @Shagidzun KEKW
[2:36:20] zafahh: viego already buying some armor
[2:36:28] ChaosHK: Sylas becomes dad YEP
[2:36:32] Sakyn: @GreenMamb4 THIS'LL SEND THEM RUNNING
[2:36:44] Komlin111: Yepge
[2:36:56] Komlin111: jarven be like
[2:37:04] ToneDoLOL: @Shagidzun new toxic phrase NOWAYING mom sky SMOLDER R
[2:37:38] PRISMOH: crazy damage XD
[2:37:55] Swyteh: dude that dorans ring first item is actually smart
[2:38:18] butewen: You need to focus stacking
[2:38:33] ChaosHK: nice to see Naut actually built tanky
[2:39:31] Aura_Jakkaru: support 1/3rd of teams death NotLikeThis
[2:39:42] ChaosHK: engage support life LUL
[2:40:07] ChaosHK: if anyone has to face tank the rat, it's naut
[2:40:23] PRISMOH: rip
[2:40:25] Komlin111: bel no kraken
[2:40:39] chipichipichapachapagr: he is too fed atp
[2:41:01] Aura_Jakkaru: 30 stackies
[2:41:05] Shiibbae: I feel you need 4 ppl minimum for the rat rn
[2:41:14] ChaosHK: Speaking of bulkin the f up, Aatrox better pick up some armor
[2:41:16] Shiibbae: that was a good hook but just not enough damag
[2:42:02] ChaosHK: Terminus without rage blade Susge
[2:42:06] ChaosHK: have fun stacking that shit
[2:42:16] ChaosHK: ... hell, even WITH rageblade, have fun
[2:42:35] darkadreuss: so Jarvan V is better as midlaner than adc?
[2:42:35] Komlin111: karma op
[2:42:41] szeniks213: usefull
[2:42:43] maxi_srm: this champ feels kinda useless .-.
[2:42:45] v8anderson: CAnono
[2:42:51] ChaosHK: J5 is indeed better mid LUL
[2:42:56] midknightcc: @darkadreuss I see what you did there lol
[2:42:57] v8anderson: Canon for Q ?
[2:43:01] chipichipichapachapagr: he isn't useless, his team doesn't have dmg
[2:43:05] The6357Chris: iunno...ive beaten every smolder ive come across..
[2:43:11] maksiis_: do u Tom√°≈° play jhin?
[2:43:13] ChaosHK: well, IDEALLY you take him bot, but mid you don't insta lose due to the support
[2:43:16] hambone_cam: feel like smolder ult should have a burn on it, like rumble ult
[2:43:33] anti_negative_: i keep thinking ur ezreal lol
[2:43:35] xheissy: It doesn't matter what stream I open, everyone's team mates always suck apparently lmaoo
[2:43:36] ApheliosTheFaithful: 1 more stack
[2:43:57] Aura_Jakkaru: that fight was 5 kill
[2:44:00] Aura_Jakkaru: if 1 more stack
[2:44:02] zathura6: so i just got here and i already see a surrender i see that this game is going really well
[2:44:02] mc_durb: @xheissy it's a selfish game, no matter the rank
[2:44:02] Sanguchotos: @xheissy that's league for u
[2:44:11] chipichipichapachapagr: tbh it's 14 Vs 31 but hope dies last
[2:44:18] anti_negative_: streamers also play the game all day for a living
[2:44:23] maxi_srm: how does the passive work? 0.0
[2:44:24] ChaosHK: An then there is the lightrocket incident Kappa
[2:44:30] butewen: You had 80 stacks in first 10mins but you stopped stacking between 10-20 @ikeepittaco
[2:44:34] zathura6: so that means i need to be a streamer so i can be a god at leauge
[2:44:39] darkadreuss: Aatrox player doing his job as the toxic teammate LUL
[2:44:39] Sakyn: @maxi_srm Stacks by hitting shit with Q
[2:44:40] zathura6: got it
[2:44:42] anti_negative_: thats sadge
[2:44:53] anti_negative_: belveth is so broken rn too
[2:44:54] Komlin111: yeah the bel build is really weird
[2:45:00] ChaosHK: 225 Q turns burns over 3 sec for 6% hp. True damage. Also executes people who fall bellow 2% + 1 per 40 stack HP
[2:45:01] anti_negative_: actual 1v9 champ
[2:45:01] Cata_110: What changes at 225 stack?
[2:45:07] Komlin111: feels like she shouldnt be that bad
[2:45:09] fadedmaster5: GG
[2:45:14] ChaosHK: or in simple terms, 225 smolder is baby elder dragon
[2:45:15] maxi_srm: @Sakyn and what do the stacks do? I think at like 150 his Q pops behind the target
[2:45:16] Sakyn: @Cata_110 Google
[2:45:28] Sakyn: @maxi_srm He gets additional effects to his Q.
[2:45:36] maxi_srm: kk, thx
[2:45:37] hambone_cam: @Cata_110 he becomes a baby elder drag
[2:45:52] Sakyn: BABY DWAGON
[2:45:56] Sakyn: TIME WIZAD
[2:46:00] ChaosHK: stacks improve Q (25 aoe, 125 extra aoe, 225 elder dragon) and give all his abilities (minus r) some damage
[2:46:16] pixiiee_: smolder just takes awhile to get going as well. people assume he sucks because he doesn‚Äôt do much early, but I‚Äôve seen the late game potential
[2:46:21] Cata_110: Ty
[2:46:39] chipichipichapachapagr: there u go
[2:46:39] anti_negative_: people just love shit talking the new champ
[2:46:45] mc_durb: @pixiiee_ Late. Game.
[2:46:51] anti_negative_: till riot gives them buffs they dont need and they 1v9
[2:46:54] ChaosHK: also, weirdly enough, the stacks give magic damage shrujj
[2:46:54] Sakyn: People complaining on reddit day 1 of release that he sucks early game. Guys, he's a scaling ADC and got released into a meta where hes going to be weak.
[2:47:03] anti_negative_: yep
[2:47:39] yuguero1: if smolder were a champion they would have won those tfs
[2:47:54] Mvgetsu: @yuguero1 smolder just needs 10 more minutes and he can carry
[2:47:59] Kwidu: I think Smolder is still too weak early and mid game
[2:48:01] ChaosHK: Kayle is 53% winrate emerald+ btw LUL
[2:48:04] pixiiee_: @mc_durb this is not a good example game. teammates are making a lot of mistakes
[2:48:05] Sensei_Ducky: people should pass a test to be eligable to play ranked, game knowledge they dont have it
[2:48:06] v8anderson: Did u try smoulder letality ?
[2:48:07] Aangkujo: I think its just at the rate he scales is whats killing him
[2:48:07] zathura6: does smolder need to last hit with his q to get stacks?
[2:48:14] LevinRoyale: People expect all new champs to just be consistent on all stages of the game with no weakpoints and then complain when they have no counterplay
[2:48:15] Sakyn: Can you Q during E?
[2:48:19] anti_negative_: smolder carries now, with almost 300 stacks
[2:48:21] LevinRoyale: The League Community will never really be happy with anything.
[2:48:23] LevinRoyale: KEKW
[2:48:26] ChaosHK: using a skill during E cancels the flight
[2:48:29] Komlin111: hahaha bel has 0% winrate on bel
[2:48:30] anti_negative_: welp
[2:48:35] Sakyn: @ChaosHK Good
[2:48:35] Diarmmy: I've just never seen a game, even if he gets 225, even if he's popping off, where I thought wow thank god that person didn't pick literally anything else., I want him to be good, I like his design and i like Kayle, but he's not it rn
[2:48:41] anti_negative_: oh is this bel first timing
[2:48:43] CheesyShoe: Kayle gets a quadra there
[2:48:44] ChaosHK: and stacks are generated by last hitting with Q OR hitting abilities on champs
[2:48:51] Sakyn: People shoudl be maxing W first early game.
[2:48:52] anti_negative_: makes sense
[2:49:00] Kwidu: of course Kayle or Kassadin also need lvl 16 and then have a big impact, but it's too hard rn, at least in this meta
[2:49:01] Komlin111: look bels account
[2:49:02] Swyteh: @Diarmmy idk i played him twice and had two 20 bombs, champ feels good
[2:49:13] ninja44jhin: wher is jhin
[2:49:14] Diarmmy: @Swyteh he's win-more
[2:49:17] anti_negative_: yeah first time belveth p much lol
[2:49:20] Kynshassa: I think his E needs reduced cd at higher levels, otherwise he gets picked so easy
[2:49:22] mc_durb: @Diarmmy I 100% agree
[2:49:25] pixiiee_: feel like naut should‚Äôve stayed on top of you as well
[2:49:27] Meeso_bb: you should build frozen heart
[2:49:29] ZapeOW: !rank
[2:49:29] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our

[2:49:59] MangekyoZed: I really dislike how this season feels
[2:50:05] learkyu: bro fuck that botlane
[2:50:12] kaiceypop: can you show
[2:50:18] Kwidu: the champ sur need tweaks cause being so obsessed to stack until 225 to be relevant in the game is not that fun
[2:50:25] ChaosHK: link in chat pl0x
[2:50:26] MangekyoZed: for some reason ap assassins/ mages get super fed every game and they just one shot you
[2:50:37] ChaosHK: oh LUL
[2:50:38] kaiceypop: link pls
[2:50:40] BigManAlexx_: @IKeepItTaco have you tried the comet rune page, it feels so good on my mom https://prnt.sc/6DXgbKGhtba5
[2:50:42] IKeepItTaco: https://twitter.com/skypture/status/1753864549399142410
[2:50:53] BigManAlexx_: oh
[2:50:54] BigManAlexx_: LOL
[2:50:55] MangekyoZed: I have had a few games with kata or lb where they were super high lvl really fast and you couldnt do shit as jhin
[2:50:56] BigManAlexx_: mb
[2:50:57] Komlin111: at least with syndra u can kinda feel like you can play the gamer normally
[2:51:00] Nucl3arWinter: @kwidu well that's also kayld and asol
[2:51:12] Sakyn: He doesn't suck. He needs to scale. He's a scaling champ caught in a meta not fit for him.
[2:51:16] ItsMeKvik: @IKeepItTaco do you actually like tacos?
[2:51:47] MeerTwT: if ur not gona try it u will never know
[2:51:49] MangekyoZed: Did they do any xp changes with the new season? I feel like midlaners are super high lvl everytime theyre ahead. Like faster than last season
[2:51:49] anti_negative_: comet manaflow is interesting
[2:51:55] Neo4Zero: @IKeepItTaco have your tried that build you linked with eclipse, spear and serylda core?
[2:51:55] Kwidu: @Nucl3arWinter i fell like Smolder has a harder time scaling then other scaling champs
[2:52:05] MeerTwT: u have to hit back wave and the opponent to make it work
[2:52:10] entman13: Play Jihn My Boy !!!!!!
[2:52:10] Neo4Zero: i ahve ran it a few games and it feels good
[2:52:16] pixiiee_: this is so wholesome
[2:52:23] flicc02: Man this early game rough af
[2:52:27] ItsMeKvik: Feel like Smolder is strong early but fails as a scaling champ due to slow scaling or lack luster scaling
[2:52:27] maksiis_: do a jhin plsss
[2:52:30] ChaosHK: hmm
[2:52:32] ToneDoLOL: thats what i think as well
[2:52:55] anti_negative_: i like the bt on him
[2:53:05] anti_negative_: that feels really good
[2:53:09] entman13: it wayne Play Jihn ^^
[2:53:24] xheissy: How many items do you think smolder needs to feel strong?
[2:53:52] ChaosHK: sheen damage (base AD, so like 50ish early) should be higher than caulfield (25 ad) on the Q at least, but I guess you gotta respect the auto damage
[2:53:56] anti_negative_: 3 is large, reaver spike is also big
[2:54:05] ramisaffour: ramisaffour is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to IKeepItTaco's community! They've gifted a total of 11 in the channel!

[2:54:49] entman13: is Jihn SO bad ?
[2:55:29] ChaosHK: Jhin one of the top ADC IIRC
[2:55:33] pixiiee_: I didn‚Äôt like smolders design, but watching you play him has made me find him pretty cute

[2:56:23] ChaosHK: Akali mid
[2:56:26] ramisaffour: ikeepitLOVERBOI
[2:56:30] ChaosHK: NOT a comet game I'd say
[2:56:36] pixiiee_: yoooo it‚Äôs the non toxic supp main @polypuff
[2:56:37] Diarmmy: kayle's self-peel also scales though, if you're gonna get 1-shot on smolder you will always get 1-shot
[2:56:41] anti_negative_: im curious to see comet at some point tho
[2:57:04] ChaosHK: There is an argument for shieldbow 3rd on Smolder
[2:57:06] entman13: i stop Playing lol 8 monts and i happy ;D
[2:57:10] Aura_Jakkaru: riotproxzon, says theyre looking at giving him ability resets on kills but theyre not too sure yet
[2:57:18] gloww1337: Hellooo!

[2:57:46] ChaosHK: I MEAN SURE
[2:57:50] anti_negative_: not emerald btw lol
[2:58:01] ChaosHK: we somehow walked with only 2 stacks LUL
[2:58:07] ChaosHK: and no EXP
[2:58:09] Aura_Jakkaru: only used 1 q
[2:58:14] Kwidu: omg Darius HOB already blaming others... not good :D
[2:58:24] Aura_Jakkaru: i mean w
[2:58:31] CrolsS: 104 dmg looks nice for lvl 1
[2:58:33] ChaosHK: Doran shield Yone
[2:58:35] ChaosHK: dude came prepared
[2:58:38] ChaosHK: for the booger
[2:58:43] megaanium: imagine if when smolder using his ult, we can see a silhouette of his mother comes and attacking instead of a just a fire. what a shame
[2:58:59] megaanium: like arthas sindragosa in hots
[2:59:03] megaanium: that would be dope
[2:59:16] anti_negative_: sounds buggy
[2:59:30] anti_negative_: oofer
[2:59:33] ChaosHK: Yone counter POG
[2:59:37] AlwaysSorrowOW: Flap FLAP!@!! BuddhaBar
[2:59:46] ChaosHK: we can out yone the yone

[3:00:06] zathura6: Yo i made meat pies from scratch today chat 1600 Britain had some dope heavy food back then
[3:00:18] anti_negative_: thats like when i first timed briar in normals and started q instead of E. lol instantly lost lane
[3:00:40] yellow_9797: This champion sucks tbh
[3:00:47] anti_negative_: good take
[3:00:52] ChaosHK: FirstTimeChatter
[3:01:02] pixiiee_: do any of his non ultimate abilities have Ap scaling?
[3:01:05] ChaosHK: yeah, the champ MIGHT need some adjusments
[3:01:15] ChaosHK: W is 35%+65% ap
[3:01:23] pixiiee_: Ty
[3:01:29] Aura_Jakkaru: lilia sus
[3:01:30] ChaosHK: Q is 15% (x1.3 based on crit chance)

[3:02:34] KayXOTV: LOL
[3:02:36] zathura6: its only been 5 min
[3:02:38] Firajo: this the same lilia from earlier?
[3:02:40] MangekyoZed: ekko does feel op this season tbh
[3:02:41] sphynnxx: jgl has the mental fortitude of a potato
[3:02:41] EpicNarwhal_: Is Smolder better mid than ADC?
[3:02:45] anti_negative_: the pyschology is too deep to unpack
[3:02:46] megaanium: tell her her obv mistake
[3:02:48] zathura6: and she already gonna bend over loool
[3:02:48] ChaosHK: yes
[3:02:50] megaanium: otherwise they wont learn
[3:02:56] MangekyoZed: nah never chat with people like that
[3:03:00] Kwidu: Lol is amazing how it brings the worst in people, so many players are displaying their stupidity
[3:03:02] pixiiee_: it‚Äôs always the people with the box names
[3:03:03] TheFlamingTiger357: so early game lillia is trying to 1v1 ekko?
[3:03:06] TheFlamingTiger357: smart
[3:03:06] Shiibbae: league players will take anything take accountablitu
[3:03:12] zathura6: i bet the lillia would take offense from advice
[3:03:21] Aura_Jakkaru: inhuman
[3:03:22] ChaosHK: well, mid is better for the Smolder player. Hurts the team comp, but this is soloq, we don't do 'team comps' here Kappa
[3:03:26] zathura6: npc
[3:03:26] CictorGabriel: shes gonna disconnect
[3:03:30] megaanium: lilia blame taco again hahaha
[3:03:54] NapNapoleon: Even gave the kill to darius through the bleed KEKW
[3:04:02] KitsuneMasami: Team dies trillions of times, Smolder doing fine "Why is our AD mid so bad?"
[3:04:07] ChaosHK: also, can we talk about how Smolder, scalling ADC btw, happens to beat GODDAMN YONE?
[3:04:10] Th0masRaines: she just came to get the kill
[3:04:11] ChaosHK: LUL
[3:04:25] Th0masRaines: super jg to the rescue
[3:04:42] pixiiee_: taco makes me want tacos so bad
[3:04:53] megaanium: @ChaosHK bcs 3 v 1?
[3:05:01] ChaosHK: in lane I mean
[3:05:14] Skaftoise: Macaiyla, ask the doctors for the "husband" stitch after you give birth, a little treat for T
[3:05:18] ChaosHK: Yone is supposed to be this early game monster that everyone hates to lane, then there is disney dragon here LUL
[3:05:18] megaanium: i dont think smoldering beat yone
[3:05:20] anti_negative_: yeah ur team is big scaling
[3:06:06] pixiiee_: @chaoshk think a lot of it is because smolder has movement and range
[3:06:10] Aura_Jakkaru: mf is not even trying to hide it
[3:06:35] ChaosHK: Precisely, smolder just happens to have the right tools FeelsWoahMan
[3:06:44] anti_negative_: nahh
[3:06:49] Th0masRaines: nt
[3:06:51] CictorGabriel: blitz took forever to hook
[3:07:20] Squagbam: hi chat hi taco
[3:07:26] Lickity_splyt: That Yone play was clean
[3:07:38] Aura_Jakkaru: spooky
[3:07:59] wwaterbearer: is blitz like autofill or an enchanter main?
[3:08:04] Archaius: whats your winrate on smolder? ive heared the champ kinda sucks bc games dont last long enough
[3:08:08] wwaterbearer: he doesnt seem confident on the champ
[3:08:15] megaanium: smolder doesnt counter yone lol
[3:08:24] ChaosHK: 78% win rate blitz over 23 games
[3:08:40] wwaterbearer: huh, oh
[3:08:46] ChaosHK: buuut
[3:08:48] zathura6: yeah that was sad
[3:08:55] ChaosHK: enchanter main OMEGALUL
[3:08:55] Nightbot: eat glue, drool on keyboard, mental boom, head hit desk.
[3:09:03] zathura6: but dont worry you got this and you will get you lp
[3:09:14] ChaosHK: A Janna and Sera main, but enchanter main anyways
[3:09:37] Osloares: well that was a hook
[3:09:41] Archaius: this blitz sucks
[3:09:42] ChaosHK: seems that his weakness is pyke
[3:09:45] Archaius: that hook was terrible
[3:09:48] soggy4047: Yeah this blitz is fucking dogshig
[3:09:49] ChaosHK: all enchanters fear the pyke
[3:10:02] Th0masRaines: blitz¬¥s hooks
[3:10:23] wwaterbearer: yeah thats why i was asking if blitz was auto, but i mean its a skillshot
[3:10:25] pixiiee_: I feel like blitz should be hitting more hooks if he‚Äôs a Janna main Janna a is harder to hit if you don‚Äôt have w
[3:10:25] wwaterbearer: can't land 100% of them
[3:10:42] CictorGabriel: if you scale enough you can carry
[3:10:42] qualiea: !rank
[3:10:42] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[3:11:00] ChaosHK: it does feel like he is playing weird. He does play blitz a lot, but he gives a lot of respect to pyke
[3:11:04] gloww1337: @IKeepItTaco Play Jhin to reset the wins! =))
[3:11:12] Sovekz: Is Spyro any good?
[3:11:23] ChaosHK: Jarvan 5 is pretty reasonable mid
[3:11:33] ChaosHK: afaik as scalling champs go
[3:11:36] CictorGabriel: D:
[3:11:43] zathura6: amen
[3:11:44] megaanium: how abt play mf?
[3:11:55] pixiiee_: just keep having fun instead
[3:11:58] NapNapoleon: An artist cannot work under these conditions !
[3:12:01] zathura6: workhouse conditions
[3:12:07] better_call_sion: using jhin quotes lol
[3:12:11] nunox21: too much pressure on blitz
[3:12:11] wwaterbearer: as a super aggro support thats how i feel with adcs. i get adcs that never want to trade and constantly hide behind me
[3:12:26] wwaterbearer: as *SORAKA* I'll have the enemy down to 1/4th hp. BOTH of them. And my adc still hides behind me.
[3:12:26] ChaosHK: sounds like it's time to switch to hwei and become a different artist YEP
[3:12:29] gloww1337: @IKeepItTaco Aren't the supports better in this elo... ? You're GM like
[3:12:29] ChaosHK: also, goddamn adge
[3:12:31] blackobelisk1337: @NapNapoleon His genius will be understood... eventually...
[3:13:02] zathura6: @gloww1337 i have seen them make super low elo mistakes more then you know its crazy
[3:13:15] zathura6: and then they get tilted
[3:13:17] hmmidk85: FirstTimeChatter what does smolders passive do btw
[3:13:19] zathura6: and then game
[3:13:21] CictorGabriel: no way what
[3:13:22] ChaosHK: pyke lived?
[3:13:23] pixiiee_: @wwaterbearer it‚Äôs the exact same for me, they think I‚Äôm going to play super passive just because I‚Äôm an enchanter
[3:13:27] better_call_sion: FirstTimeChatter
[3:13:40] gloww1337: @zathura6 Everyone make misstakes no matter which elo but if you get grip of the concept of playing your lane it shouldn't be so hard....
[3:13:44] Kwidu: MF inting
[3:13:45] wwaterbearer: @pixiiee_ I hate it. Enchanters are strongest super early and late.
[3:13:46] ChaosHK: smolder passive gives his abilities more damage, upgrades his Q
[3:13:49] megaanium: you shud play mf taco ur the best
[3:13:50] blackobelisk1337: heal abusing DansGame
[3:13:51] wwaterbearer: soraka HURTS early.
[3:14:05] pixiiee_: ik she‚Äôs a beast
[3:14:07] CictorGabriel: His Q skill icon looks unfinished
[3:14:13] hmmidk85: @ChaosHK thx
[3:14:14] pixiiee_: and she heals
[3:14:17] gloww1337: @IKeepItTaco What do you think about Smolder... ?
[3:14:21] wwaterbearer: and when i play rakan and try to zone, adcs, again, hide a screen away afk farming.
[3:14:27] wwaterbearer: and I just do not get it.
[3:14:28] better_call_sion: havent seen a single soraka tbh
[3:14:33] NapNapoleon: Great people all that.
[3:14:34] Aura_Jakkaru: team is ensuring u cant play
[3:14:36] wwaterbearer: i fucking love raka and rakan.
[3:14:40] better_call_sion: lots of millios ....
[3:14:51] gloww1337: Milio is meta atm
[3:14:57] ThaisonS: hi taco
[3:15:05] wwaterbearer: makes sense with his ulti and q peel.
[3:15:06] Scolera_Star: Scolera_Star subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[3:15:10] pixiiee_: yeah milio is super strong with the right adc
[3:15:20] wwaterbearer: the adc has to not be a little bitch
[3:15:42] better_call_sion: is maokai hotfixed btw? KEKW
[3:15:58] better_call_sion: 56% global wr is crazy alright
[3:16:01] ChaosHK: doesn't seem like they are hotfixing him
[3:16:11] pixiiee_: I perma ban him idk
[3:16:17] ChaosHK: not sure how his wr is still up with all the wiseTree inting in taco's stream alone
[3:16:19] blackobelisk1337: whats wrong with mao?
[3:16:20] wwaterbearer: whats making mao broken?
[3:16:26] zathura6: what adc is good with milo?
[3:16:26] wwaterbearer: item or base stats
[3:16:32] owllra: tank items
[3:16:43] wwaterbearer: ah yeah taht makes sense
[3:16:51] Quelex: This champion looks terrible
[3:16:51] owllra: @zathura6 lucain is very very broken with milio rn
[3:16:54] ChaosHK: FH is a hell of a drug monkaHmm
[3:16:57] pixiiee_: he‚Äôs an unmovable object
[3:17:04] wwaterbearer: FH?
[3:17:05] CictorGabriel: darius is trying at least
[3:17:08] ChaosHK: frozen heart
[3:17:10] anti_negative_: lucian is much less broken this patch
[3:17:12] wwaterbearer: AH
[3:17:20] wwaterbearer: yeah. I love getting it.
[3:17:21] anti_negative_: aphelios lookin stronger tho
[3:17:36] gmoyano: after 225 do stacks do anything
[3:17:44] wwaterbearer: I usually have to go tanky as rakan cause no one else in gold wants to go tank. So I just sit on the adc and peel, but FH is so good.
[3:17:55] Lettish: Does Shyv passiv stacks on Smolder ?
[3:18:05] anti_negative_: hmm
[3:18:17] CrolsS: Huge
[3:18:21] anti_negative_: rookern lookin balanced

[3:18:31] blackobelisk1337: how did sera live so long wtf KEKW
[3:18:32] wwaterbearer: i fuckin love rookern
[3:18:35] ChaosHK: execute don't stack
[3:18:42] ChaosHK: no collector shenanigans LUL
[3:18:51] majoralexlol: Awww shucks :(
[3:18:54] anti_negative_: darius actualy 1v9s ur frontline
[3:18:56] anti_negative_: giga winnable
[3:19:10] anti_negative_: YEP
[3:19:12] ChaosHK: Maw Pyke
[3:19:23] ChaosHK: dude really just said 'fuck Lillia'
[3:19:31] pixiiee_: sometimes you have to pay the tilt tax
[3:19:34] Jereaa: KEKW
[3:19:36] Lazynameross: cant they just click you OMEGALUL
[3:19:38] owllra: they can click you and see the stacks tho...
[3:19:40] anti_negative_: only if they dont click on lol
[3:19:41] Official_Owo: Gaslighting
[3:19:42] ramisaffour: white lie
[3:19:44] Official_Owo: KEKW
[3:19:44] pixiiee_: especially when your adc thinks they‚Äôre T1
[3:19:46] Littledc: league is a game of gaslighting
[3:19:47] Ethiriel: TRUE
[3:19:48] Jereaa: KomradeBoi
[3:19:52] Littledc: whoever gaslights better wins
[3:19:53] 7thSeraf: Dont like that one
[3:19:56] Ethiriel: mental warfare but on your won team
[3:20:00] Ethiriel: you own*
[3:20:06] d1m1tr1j3: Smolder is basically if Ezreal was released in season 14 xD
[3:20:17] connymon97: @IKeepItTaco Why did you start dorans ring or why are people buying that item so often?
[3:20:25] wwaterbearer: does smolder e dodge jinx chompers or nidalee traps, etc?
[3:20:28] wwaterbearer: how is it coded?
[3:20:30] anti_negative_: lilia doesnt want u to have stacks
[3:20:40] TsmMarko: is every chicken a stack
[3:20:48] ChaosHK: doran's is mana regen + extra poke/wave clear on W
[3:20:48] Lazynameross: you cant walkover traps

[3:21:08] wwaterbearer: ah ok ty
[3:21:09] ChaosHK: doran + stat runes + dark seal Is the strat, with 3 points in W
[3:21:18] Jereaa: lie again
[3:21:19] Jereaa: KEKW
[3:21:23] pixiiee_: would‚Äôve made sense if he could fly over them
[3:21:36] anti_negative_: ok ty mf
[3:21:41] zathura6: they be like no little dragon you can not have stacks now go roll in the grass or somthing
[3:21:44] wwaterbearer: yeah thats what im thinking. he can go over terrain so why not traps
[3:22:06] anti_negative_: because they have a triger radius prob
[3:22:09] better_call_sion: Flap! Flap! Flap! ends prematurely if Smolder gets immobilized or uses abilities - lol wiki
[3:22:16] CictorGabriel: yooo his ult actualy did damage
[3:22:25] anti_negative_: 10 more stackies

[3:25:07] better_call_sion: ekko has undodgable burst
[3:25:20] wwaterbearer: reports taco
[3:25:26] ChaosHK: The fact Ekko 'unlose button' (R) is ALSO a massive nuke makes me wonder if August took advice from CertaintlyT Kappa
[3:25:32] connymon97: adc player talking right there @better_call_sion
[3:25:36] Jereaa: its ok
[3:26:15] ChaosHK: pull the dragon please guys
[3:26:17] owllra: USE R
[3:26:18] Lazynameross: who needs to pull
[3:26:19] alpha_kadse: why tf does only your r cost mana, this is just glorified resourceless
[3:26:31] Jereaa: omg
[3:26:39] ChaosHK: all his skills cost mana
[3:26:40] better_call_sion: @connymon97 not adc player but technically his E cannot be dodged and it procs lich bane and makes it easy to land his 3 hit passive which procs stormsurge which overkills you anyway
[3:26:43] connymon97: @alpha_kadse bugged
[3:26:43] Jereaa: that was sick
[3:26:55] Littledc: so is smoulder just better mid rn?
[3:26:56] ChaosHK: Taco just hides the mana cost for... wait, why does it show only the ult?
[3:27:00] ChaosHK: Susge
[3:27:03] connymon97: @better_call_sion all I here is cope and skill issue
[3:27:20] better_call_sion: okay bro
[3:27:23] ramisaffour: does it benefit getting more than 250 stacks ?
[3:27:24] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[3:27:34] wwaterbearer: @ramisaffour i believe it makes the damage higher yes?
[3:27:34] ChaosHK: no more upgrade spast 225
[3:27:36] T_Unit_wc: that was sick
[3:27:39] Ethiriel: yeah, smolder has infinite scaling
[3:27:39] ChaosHK: but the damage gets higher
[3:27:39] better_call_sion: damage from items is stupid in my opinion
[3:27:41] anti_negative_: yea execute goes up as well i think
[3:27:43] ChaosHK: the execute as well
[3:27:47] ChaosHK: and more explosions
[3:27:50] Lazynameross: continued stacking just adds more dmg to your base spells
[3:28:00] laikanangel: @ramisaffour Yeah. Big boy stacks= Big Boy Damage
[3:28:01] Official_Owo: Frog on frog violence PepeHands
[3:28:03] blackobelisk1337: good noise BWAAAAAH
[3:28:09] Alamand_: How come only ult shows mana cost is their question
[3:28:10] connymon97: just now it was ekkos dmg now you blame it on items damn
[3:28:19] anti_negative_: visual bug i guess
[3:28:22] tocsickk: @ramisaffour yes ur % to execute gets higher at 250 its like 6% hp to execute later on avg in late game its 12-15% hp left for execute
[3:28:24] reaper_of_aspects: unrealistically the abillitys gets more aoe bomb the more stacks you get
[3:28:27] Lazynameross: i thought pink doesnt nothing for shroud
[3:28:36] reaper_of_aspects: at 2k stacks its a full aoe around the target

[3:40:56] Klony99: @miller0493 No, he said they are good balance nerfs, and won't screw the champ over. Though we have a much better experience with mid Smolder right now, so that might teach you something about Jhin's place in general.
[3:41:01] lethalbonsai: ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH

[3:46:22] lethalbonsai: @Klony99 he took it as example
[3:46:54] olioxe: thats the ez right?
[3:47:03] NapNapoleon: So you were right that it was a bought account
[3:47:23] lethalbonsai: but ig cola puts add on every first world country
[3:47:24] NapNapoleon: Jhym
[3:47:31] freinheit: good morning taco VoHiYo
[3:47:33] MangekyoZed: bruh ranked is tilting me so fucking much
[3:47:37] MangekyoZed: this is so disgusting
[3:47:45] MangekyoZed: I keep playing against shitty ass smoulder players
[3:47:47] NapNapoleon: Wait, are those runes right?
[3:48:04] kobitosage6: what‚Äôs a bot account?
[3:48:08] MangekyoZed: destroy them in lane, but the enemy mid laner is always stupid fed
[3:48:19] MangekyoZed: Kata, Ekko, Ori
[3:48:22] lethalbonsai: @IKeepItTaco i mean i get more joy from a hard game than a free lp one
[3:48:29] bizarredoll69: question, if I'm in a 3rd world country I would not get the ads, but if I use a VPN?
[3:48:32] khlori: Syndra Despairge
[3:48:35] pixiiee_: @kobitosage6 bought account
[3:48:36] kobitosage6: play smolder ?
[3:48:39] MysticMachia: Has Fleet become the norm again?
[3:48:40] MangekyoZed: I just can't do shit if someone is 4 levels above me and simply one shots me
[3:48:47] lethalbonsai: well im also happy when they troll but
[3:48:52] kobitosage6: @pixiiee_ ok thx
[3:48:59] lethalbonsai: when i want to have fun and i mean real fun i want a strong enemy side
[3:49:01] MangekyoZed: Every single game this season is the same
[3:49:06] MangekyoZed: literally the same shit
[3:49:09] Inf1ni7y: Is it more difficult to be a good support or a good ADC?
[3:49:09] MangekyoZed: super fed mid laner
[3:49:53] lethalbonsai: @Inf1ni7y i think adc is harder
[3:50:07] lethalbonsai: tbh imo adc is the hardest role to master
[3:50:10] guidofacundo: Why FFW Jhin this game? Why not DH?
[3:50:13] MangekyoZed: I just keep playing against smurfs too, what the fuck is wrong with the ranked system?
[3:50:33] MangekyoZed: lvl 30, first ranked game ever. Plays ari perfectly and carries the whole game
[3:50:40] spartanx2590: @Inf1ni7y mechanically ADC is more difficult, macro level probably support due to knowing when/where to roam
[3:50:58] MangekyoZed: Orianna*
[3:51:01] guidofacundo: So he wouldn't engage so you can get stacks?
[3:51:44] cu_de_sanfona: That Zyra skin looks like Sivir
[3:52:00] lethalbonsai: @cu_de_sanfona thats the reason xd
[3:52:02] lethalbonsai: confuse enemies
[3:52:59] lethalbonsai: zyra plants are so annoying man
[3:53:02] lethalbonsai: i hate those
[3:53:16] Carolinaapa: @cu_de_sanfona is easy to find brazilian by the nickname
[3:53:20] better_call_sion: all i see is +4
[3:53:25] khlori: Mao sapling gonna be just free heal for Sivir every 20seconds (or w/e the cd is) TrollDespair
[3:53:26] better_call_sion: Keepo
[3:53:50] m_v443: ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH
[3:54:01] lethalbonsai: that sivir got to be a good adc
[3:54:17] lethalbonsai: i have never seen a bad sivir
[3:54:28] lener311: @lethalbonsai hot take
[3:54:31] maw_of_malmortius: @lethalbonsai me, I am bad sivir
[3:54:33] lener311: im a bad sivir
[3:54:43] ramisaffour: sivir counters jhin
[3:54:53] maw_of_malmortius: @lener311 brother
[3:55:04] lener311: @maw_of_malmortius xdddd
[3:55:06] lethalbonsai: no i mean eveyone who plays sivir is a good adc generaly ig
[3:55:20] lener311: @lethalbonsai yea, maybe that's true
[3:55:53] MangekyoZed: Didnt riot say smurf queue wouldn't exist anymore?
[3:56:09] lethalbonsai: @MangekyoZed if you perform well a couple of games
[3:56:16] lethalbonsai: you will fill with good lobby
[3:56:24] khlori: @MangekyoZed You believe goverment too? DogeKEK
[3:56:30] cu_de_sanfona: D:
[3:56:36] MangekyoZed: I haven't performed in ranked since 2020
[3:56:37] Zhorieg: D:
[3:56:42] better_call_sion: BASED
[3:56:50] cogstopper: Have you gotten even 1 smart Maokai support lately? hinaboPausechamp
[3:56:53] lethalbonsai: 1.5 more hours until my restriction is removed xd
[3:56:56] maw_of_malmortius: @lethalbonsai I play sivir even before her VGU and I'm still bad at it
[3:57:04] P4hagen: How else would he learn
[3:57:07] MangekyoZed: I literally lost almost all of my placements last season and got gold 2
[3:57:31] khlori: Support players having brain challenge (emotional)
[3:57:33] 1Koddy: i havent had a good supp for like 30 games
[3:57:34] MangekyoZed: this season, instantly gold 2 and only smurfs in my games. Like super obvious low lvl accounts that play way too good with high winrates
[3:57:38] Zephanyx: btw why did maokai support became a thing again ?
[3:57:57] lethalbonsai: taco incident
[3:57:59] MysticMachia: I love Zyra! A champion for dummies. She can miss her stuff, and still hit you because plants
[3:58:03] NapNapoleon: Amazing.
[3:58:04] ChaosHK: people noticed maokai had a MASSIVE wr
[3:58:05] lener311: @Zephanyx riot is testing us
[3:58:05] guidofacundo: Does it make any difference to go crit or let running FFW?
[3:58:10] ChaosHK: so people picked up wiseTree
[3:58:14] lethalbonsai: his support was left alone *sad emoji*
[3:58:16] ChaosHK: ... no one is quite sure wtf happened
[3:58:21] cogstopper: maokai gets a double so it was totally worth it right? hinaboLive
[3:58:22] Zephanyx: @lener311 understandable
[3:58:24] lethalbonsai: no wait
[3:58:25] lethalbonsai: i mean
[3:58:27] pixiiee_: bro is playing the strongest supp rn, like this‚Ä¶.
[3:58:30] lethalbonsai: his support left him alone *
[3:59:05] Littledc: no wonder taco wants to play mid lol
[3:59:15] lener311: rough game...
[3:59:19] lethalbonsai: @IKeepItTaco why did that shaco had that much at speed
[3:59:21] MangekyoZed: also smurf queue just sucks ass. Its a complete coinflip who gets the better smurfs and whether they actually want to try
[3:59:31] khlori: I said it before and I'll say it again, supp players are the dumbest mfs in the game
[3:59:33] inksie: ruh roh
[3:59:38] inksie: inkmoteFlush
[3:59:42] slick_prick_: i hate when support randomly disappears lol
[3:59:52] lethalbonsai: @MangekyoZed you will never get rid of that queue
[3:59:58] lethalbonsai: whatever programmers do
[4:00:01] Syliet: FeelsBadMan
[4:00:05] lener311: sups are like my dad... leaving before lvl 3
[4:00:05] Littledc: Ive played enough support to also think the same about adcs, I think the lane is just cursed as a whole
[4:00:09] cogstopper: these maokai supports lately have felt like sona brains trying to abuse a different champ
[4:00:11] Mpolo98: WAIT YOU CAN Q ZYRTA PLANTS ?
[4:00:26] Mpolo98: my life has changed forever
[4:00:29] ChaosHK: they are fully targetable for whatever reason
[4:00:30] inksie: frog goin through it today
[4:00:47] MangekyoZed: @lethalbonsai there is literally no reason why the game could think I should be in smurf queue
[4:00:48] Xen0_0x: BigBrother
[4:00:54] ChaosHK: mao's E are also attracted to zyra plants, hilariously
[4:00:59] Brock0Lee69: Taco, i went mentally hard on the enemy l
[4:01:03] nausikha_lotus: what happened this game that he is flamming that much holy
[4:01:06] nausikha_lotus: fairygirlCry
[4:01:07] lethalbonsai: ex i am diamond skill player and i can open a new acc and at first i play bad intentionally then later i start to play seriously on silver or gold that way i can confuse the mmr alorythm
[4:01:09] Brock0Lee69: You consumed me
[4:01:15] ChaosHK: i THINK Aatrox wants to dive
[4:01:16] inksie: chat would tp for you 100%
[4:01:40] MangekyoZed: @lethalbonsai as I said, I completely fucked up my last placements and didnt play anymore and I have only lost since then
[4:01:44] starhabit: ikeepitHAT
[4:01:56] ChaosHK: I wonder what's going on in sivir's mind LUL
[4:02:17] MangekyoZed: @lethalbonsai yeah but thats not whats happening. Its low level accounts with 90% winrates
[4:02:20] lethalbonsai: @MangekyoZed that smurf guy might have inted last couple of games
[4:02:24] NapNapoleon: KEKW
[4:02:26] guidofacundo: Does it make any difference to go crit or let running FFW?
[4:02:26] khlori: Heimer RIOT

[4:03:33] khlori: Yepge
[4:03:37] MangekyoZed: I am actually considering switching to midlane. Playing adc just feels like shit right now
[4:03:50] megaanium: now i understand when u said u dont want to play adc
[4:03:57] nati_sama: how you feel withe attack speed boots on jhin?
[4:03:59] megaanium: yeah meta abuser is shit
[4:04:06] dzmnox: enemy adcs always get 2 supports
[4:04:10] Littledc: support items are just a bit too broken for adcs to have any control over the lane
[4:04:18] 88miya: 88miya subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! ikeepitLETTER
[4:04:24] Squagbam: i still remember the zyra incident
[4:04:38] guidofacundo: Is Jhin Support nerfed?
[4:04:40] lethalbonsai: @IKeepItTaco i think you should start those series from last season where you trained to not tilt
[4:04:44] lethalbonsai: the no chatting series
[4:04:45] MangekyoZed: Only difference is that in low elo bot can be carried by basically one person but that shit doesn't matter if mid is always super fed+basically op with the new items and changes
[4:05:36] ChaosHK: wonder who called that vote Kappa
[4:06:14] zeekzeeks: good evening taco and chat

[4:08:39] cogstopper: Riot should let you kill your support if they fuck up the lane for you hinaboPausechamp
[4:08:42] somerowo: somerowo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 63 months, currently on a 30 month streak! yay 63 months of being subbed and 63 months of u flaking on me and not coming to hang out with me

[4:10:58] anti_negative_: no flame ofc
