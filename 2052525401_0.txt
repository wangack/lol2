[3:22:38] Beussieu: @jaxjaxx Kassadin's ult has like 3 sec cd, so he can steal anytime he wants to
[3:22:39] doG_emiT: LUL
[3:22:40] maomaostan2: @jaxjaxx it is dependent on how long their ult CD is, Kass ult is short so the steal timer lockout is short

[5:54:36] bcharlesw24: 90g of protein a day youd get big
[5:54:36] ScrufMcgruff: Takes a while to gain muscle. Much easier to gain/lose weight/fat.

[5:54:48] bokboklol: sneak in some protein shakes
[5:54:50] Redfactor3: @Pobelter are you eating well? if you have trouble eating I recommend HUEL. Even if not work out well, if you are newbie you should still make newbie gains, just have to eat
[5:54:54] mutton123: pob eat like 1800 cal per day or less
[5:54:56] Redfactor3: also sleep
[5:54:56] ogoaxe: Try getting into calisthenics. It should make you feel stronger, when using only your weight.
[5:55:00] gymleaderswift: we need at leastt 5 days pop
[5:55:01] entropy_lol: You can also take creatine, helps
[5:55:03] KiyoKeitaro: were you doing a lot of cardio
[5:55:06] jordanmon18: @Jaguarpaw29 quinoa is the move

[5:55:43] hiiyasu: JEEZ
[5:55:44] kalaseer: at what height tho
[5:55:44] Redfactor3: @Pobelter random chatter yapping, but huel banana flavor is good. Everything else I tried tasted like dirt water, but banana flavor was decent
[5:55:44] KiyoKeitaro: pobWut
[5:55:46] Dan_Ez: if you go consistently 3+ times a week, youll see results in 3 months, until youve gone for like 9 months total then nutrition becomes a factore
[5:55:47] gymleaderswift: bro you gotta eat
[5:55:48] ckasuske14: ckasuske14 subscribed with Prime.

[5:56:22] treeofqi: i was stuck at 130-135 all my life, i started tracking macros and i just wasnt eating even close to what i thought i was. track your eating for a month and see how you do
[5:56:22] questionable_micro: i was 116 at 5'10 at some point and i felt fine
[5:56:25] the_tozo: at that height you could be cut at your weight with a bit more muscle
[5:56:31] tka_killerangel: 120 at 5 9 is like girl weight
[5:56:34] gymleaderswift: @questionable_micro lul what

[5:56:53] gymleaderswift: I started lifting at 120 HahaSweat
[5:56:57] camarorsss462: Not able to have dairy
[5:57:01] questionable_micro: @gymleaderswift it was completely fine i even played a lot of soccer and i was pretty athletic
[5:57:02] Madrai: Yea you're probably lactose intolerant
[5:57:08] kalaseer: GIGACHAD greek yogurt
[5:57:11] AlligatorsAreDope: Yeah thats pretty normal to experience as you get older
[5:57:11] tzakalz: koreans put chemicals in the water that turn the frogs gay
[5:57:14] gymleaderswift: @questionable_micro ah that makes sense
[5:57:14] entropy_lol: it can also be your reaction to the salinity in the water in america
[5:57:22] MartianMagic: I eat Greek yogurt every day too oh no
[5:57:28] tka_killerangel: chicken and rice rinse repeat
[5:57:32] gymleaderswift: @questionable_micro CAM or striker

[5:57:38] Smoot1e: tzakalz HUHH ?? What are you talking about
[5:57:44] treeofqi: cant go wrong with eggs for breakfast

[5:58:06] fritsfrets: 3
[5:58:07] gymleaderswift: eat until youre not hungry

[5:58:34] Redfactor3: @Pobelter liquid calories are the movie, I also struggled with volume
[5:58:36] Jaguarpaw29: all you need is omega fatty acids
[5:58:37] thefeargiver: eating around the same time in a routine could be good, idk
[5:58:38] gymleaderswift: I feel that make sure you eat breakfast so you metabolize foods better throughout the day
[5:58:39] questionable_micro: forcing yourself to eat is fine
[5:58:40] ecophagy: imo if you're lifting hard enough it'll make you hungry. no need to force too much
[5:58:40] Jaguarpaw29: to flex your brain even harder
[5:58:41] jian87: korean food is low in calories unlike american goop
[5:58:41] treeofqi: you need calorie dense foods. eat foods with healthy fats like eggs and nuts/nut butters
[5:58:42] Smoot1e: Maybe eat more meat?

[5:59:29] Lv_100: you might bloat up but thats mostly water weight. its temp
[5:59:30] Mate1297c: Maybe is not about the amount of food, maybe you don't eat enough protein
[5:59:30] depressedcapsfan: drinking a gallon of water a day helped me eat more

[6:00:02] lil_crackheadx: @Pobelter have you ever been skinny fat?
[6:00:06] Redfactor3: @Pobelter you can just monitor on a 2 week basis. Mirror test should be fine for beginner, but can also get one of those scales that break down fat %. Those have shit accuracy but you can track the trend of what it shows (if you use same scale)
[6:00:07] gymleaderswift: @smoot1e height besties
