[0:47:47] heisen10: wide decision making to be exact
[0:47:48] theman10n: so the better cser will win every time
[0:47:56] ewhiiii: fuegoHi yep about to head out
[0:47:58] nick_t33: macro n cheese
[0:48:01] doodlerancher: macro is how u path throughoutr the game decions u make during the early mid and late game
[0:48:18] ewhiiii: you new stream schedule is harder for me to catch kinda lowkey miss the degen hours
[0:48:19] Zefior: monkaS
[0:48:27] heisen10: u can play trtundle ahve 10 cs per min and still lose because your macro is garbage and u dont know that just tunnel vision uga uga doesnt win all the time
