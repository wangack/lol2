[3:16:24] Visloo: my man teemo is saying he has diminishing life value. WE LOVE YOU TEEMO
[3:16:26] CHOHSAN: I don't think I've seen him do well on a champion on release since AP Zeri, though. pekinThink

[3:26:48] Flippykiller1337: You have PTA
[3:26:50] Flippykiller1337: PTA is good early
[3:27:05] Flippykiller1337: oh no
[3:27:07] Flippykiller1337: No pta
[3:27:25] 19yruj: fleet or comet way better than pta
[3:27:27] GrugglesRS: Is this why I fought a Smolder that went dring and dark seal into AD
[3:27:44] Hoku_xx: @PekinWoof Gumayusi is using a lot of Smolder
[3:28:04] 19yruj: you can stack off of hitting w on champs as well until lvl 2
[3:28:18] FulzLojik: Does Q rank make a difference in stack generation?
[3:28:22] Yanshuu: Stacking slow? Like that one guy you faced xdd
[3:28:25] Visloo: which totally makes sense right? should all champions have more of a incremental leveling rather than just maxing something first every time
[3:28:33] rosalbba: yo
[3:28:37] killer52183: Have you done AP smolder in rank yet?

[3:31:09] Nightbot: Use !queue for the name of the queue game.
[3:31:18] hextectiger: Smolder is adorable.... if you're 8 years old
[3:31:28] killer52183: Smolder is a skylander
[3:31:35] pixelgel: classic karthus lvl 3 double kill
[3:31:38] Zirock_: Only Q'ing last hits gives a stack, and only 1 regardless of minion type

[3:36:12] avuloseunda: pekinUwu
[3:36:18] 19yruj: Yeah
[3:36:19] haydenh19: Pekin saying "my teammates" there had the same energy as when your brother says "my dad" instead of "our dad"
[3:36:23] Yanshuu: @avuloseunda 30% = 3/10 =/= 1/3
[3:36:27] 19yruj: er> navori

[3:37:37] LilyJade1120: mom gives up on you if you die Sadge
[3:37:39] The_Unfathomed: did your ult just go on cooldown without going off?
[3:37:48] muskiio: yu don't go eclipse on smolder?
[3:37:58] The_Unfathomed: She just stops caring Sadge
[3:38:01] Schwagbert: @LilyJade1120 My mom gave up on me long before that Despairge
[3:38:05] Yanshuu: If anything she should do more damage
[3:38:05] emma_4444_: the ratio on the R healing is AP, that's the only reason to go ap smolder lol
[3:38:07] Zirock_: @muskiio his abilities scale with crit
[3:38:11] LilyJade1120: @LilyJade1120 Despairge
[3:38:17] muskiio: only e
[3:38:19] Coojoo: one would think that if you killed her son, Mom would do MORE, not less.
[3:38:23] CHOHSAN: Yeah, the shop recommendations are so bad.
[3:38:24] 19yruj: @muskiio he scales off of crit and eclipse gives none
[3:38:26] therockcena99: the best mid runes imo is fleet and resolve tree, Dorians shield into painful lanes
[3:38:32] 아이엠더피치: her shadow strikes fear in the hearts of your enemies
[3:38:34] CHOHSAN: Even if I start lost chapter they don't recommend me a chapter item in ARAM for some reason.
[3:38:47] Flippykiller1337: Nessie
[3:38:51] mattycron1: this viktor dog feels absurd
[3:38:52] rickternet: who is he in comms w/

[3:38:58] CHOHSAN: If you kill with Q do you get 1 stack or two stacks? pekinThink
[3:39:07] CHOHSAN: He's with Fappy, AKA uhm...
[3:39:12] CHOHSAN: Tyg?
[3:39:19] LilyJade1120: PYKE KEKW
[3:39:22] Flippykiller1337: Pyke KEKL
[3:39:33] Hero_Weasel: Ults that technically summon something stopping when dying is lore accurate...
[3:39:35] Yanshuu: 66 stacks at 11 minutes gosh

[3:40:36] 19yruj: mid not so much but thats most adc's
[3:40:37] CHOHSAN: OP late game.
[3:40:43] CHOHSAN: If you get 225 stacks without falling behind.
[3:40:45] willer_willy: thats him omg its him
[3:41:00] emma_4444_: imagine not having to win the lane because your team is just always there xdd
[3:41:00] 아이엠더피치: do you think viktor just has good self control or is he just already chat banned and hes silently malding in his room lmao
[3:41:02] CHOHSAN: Pekin is very good at following guides.
[3:41:04] Frulicity: It would theorhetically be a bit better since you can stack off multiple champs
[3:41:09] CHOHSAN: And not so much trail blazing. ZombieKappa
[3:41:13] FulzLojik: Pekin triggers the fuck out of me how he never helps secure grubs.
[3:41:27] LilyJade1120: there's no way this pyke isn't getting pay pal as we speak

[4:03:14] RizqTv: fleet celerity is all u need for him
[4:03:19] UnplayableTrash: muramana is massive, huge. Crit scaling is a jebait.

[4:07:19] TetsuyaKatsuragi: fun in league is zero sum
[4:07:20] frickthislife: A little Sylas always helps to cleanse the pallet of a dogshit champ
[4:07:24] 아이엠더피치: @frickthislife no maybe, roles that fall off still being good late is great. adc faling off is like the worst thing in the game

[4:18:07] 19yruj: @STGboris you named 3 theres also mages like lux and velkoz or hwei and taliyah
[4:18:14] 아이엠더피치: traditional mages are mages that use skill shots
[4:18:21] STGboris: those champs have never been meta
[4:18:23] 아이엠더피치: azir is no skill shots
[4:18:26] t4p35: Dang

[4:18:56] ghoratv: mord is shens hardest counter
[4:18:58] STGboris: the only "traditional" mages that are meta 70% of the time are viktor ori syndra
[4:19:06] Vanilliam: and I die without being able to do shi
[4:19:20] ghoratv: top gap gg
[4:19:28] STGboris: and ori is fine rn id consider her meta
[4:19:31] Flippykiller1337: GOOOOO PEKIN WOOOOOOOF Pog
[4:19:41] Vanilliam: is Vladimir considered traditional?
[4:19:41] 19yruj: @STGboris idek why you're argueing im saying that no traditional mages are meta rn and mages aren't op like the guy was saying
[4:19:46] STGboris: @Vanilliam yes

[4:20:24] noobymaiky0: Yone mouse only
[4:20:28] 아이엠더피치: ahri tf hwei and karma all have a higher pick rate than ori rn
[4:20:28] t4p35: Of you have 4 lvls on him you can beat him
[4:20:39] 아이엠더피치: whats meta anyway
[4:20:39] TheLoFiAxolotl: they'd tell you to git gud
[4:20:50] XiComfy: they'll say hope yone hasa  stroke during laning phase
[4:21:11] Vanilliam: doesn’t any mid laner have higher pick than ori? @iamthepeachy
[4:21:20] TheLoFiAxolotl: against yone you really can't do much though
[4:21:21] Vanilliam: she doesn’t feel that popular to me in due
[4:21:30] Vanilliam: euw**
[4:21:43] 아이엠더피치: right but my point is what is "meta" if not what people are picking @Vanilliam

[4:22:18] STGboris: @19yruj i would argue traditional mages were super meta last season, but only 2 champs, syndra ori the entire season, rn ori is still meta but its corki azir also which are aa based, im not really arguing anything except the fact that there are only 3 champs that are considered "traditional mages" that are ever a part of the meta, so when would we consider traditional mages in the meta? even when its only 2 like last season? idk im just rambling

[4:24:10] 19yruj: @STGboris what I mean by "traditional mages" is just not ap assassins/bruisers or ap aa's like azir or corki, like actual mages e.g. lissandra, ahri, taliyah, hwei etc.
