[0:29:51] XLOftw: @StealingYoIPZ you can watch these vods on yt XD
[0:29:55] SomeFerretGuy: I canceled my plans of doing nothing to do nothing with you tonight cristoDEVIL
[0:30:09] najafan: A fun project, but one that would take a TON of effort, would be going through the old SI episodes, finding the gems from them in terms of comments/rants/analyses and then splicing in relevant gameplay to make a version of it that people can watch without actually being in that particular historical moment.

[0:30:41] StuntmanStan: eye contact with my date is not needed
[0:30:43] SomeFerretGuy: no do not review tl continue to pretend we do not exist thank you
[0:31:00] kb3q: @StuntmanStan just have your date watch too, sharing is caring
[0:31:00] najafan: Yeah, don't think it would be plausible, that would take a ton of effort.
[0:31:04] najafan: Full time editor level.
[0:31:28] zen__cloud: millio ult cleansed bubble @MonteCristo
[0:31:31] sLepi024: milio saves him
[0:31:31] Zebrios: I think Bull has been really impressive.  Maybe rookie of the year.
[0:31:43] dbird901: he got hit then milio ult
[0:31:43] SomeFerretGuy: no way; lucid is rookie of the year
[0:31:49] SonsOfJarvan: Bubble hit but milio r cleanses it
[0:32:04] Zebrios: @SomeFerretGuy I forgot Lucid was rookie this year.  Yeah, you prob right.
[0:32:44] Zebrios: KDF looks legit this year.  They've improved a LOT
[0:33:03] anomalous_autumn: BuLLDoG and Bull lololol funny name synergy CaitlynS
[0:33:10] docallens: fun fact, the flicker is called "Z-fighting"
[0:33:30] TwiceTSTS: KDF would be top 3 in LCS/LEC
[0:33:40] dbird901: is Bull a rookie?
[0:33:41] Zebrios: Bulls has 0 fear

[0:34:30] EliStormStrike: thanks
[0:34:54] SonsOfJarvan: Haveu seen deokdime and life on FPX? disgustingly inters, paycheck players haha
[0:34:54] Zebrios: You can take the Croco out of LCK, but you can't take the Croco out of Croco.
[0:35:02] Stormserpent101: Vicla and Prince also stinking it up in China
[0:35:03] wowcorny: I forgot croco and kael where on that sandbox team lmao

[0:35:22] TwiceTSTS: FPX, TT and AL are atrocious teams. Not even fun watching them
[0:35:29] Phaetox: You went live b4 my toddler gave up the fight for the night how is this game so even NotLikeThis
[0:35:55] Zebrios: @Phaetox KDF is legit good.
[0:35:58] bobbyhelms: womboooo
[0:36:11] zen__cloud: guess what NA player copied this play today
[0:36:26] wowcorny: KDF legit since taeyoon was replaced, this bull guy is good
[0:36:33] zen__cloud: chovy micros the clone too
[0:36:43] Zebrios: The ol misdirect
[0:36:48] gravitum_uwu: dam jojo did that today LOL
[0:37:12] Phaetox: Cuzz on his hero arc I was so worried when I first heard he went from KT to KDF but looks like it was the smart choice lol
[0:37:15] anomalous_autumn: love to see it hahaha
[0:37:19] Zebrios: @MonteCristo That the same sort of misdirect Faker used to do with Leblanc clone
[0:37:28] LautaroQ28: Hello everyone! And Monte
[0:37:42] SomeFerretGuy: Bwipo was saying using that helicopter emote is actually banned on Neeko @gravitum_uwu
[0:37:50] Zebrios: Most teams will be thinking "there's no way he's that psycho"
[0:38:01] EliStormStrike: that was cool but that lane bully cloning amumu ult should not exist
[0:38:03] GiLLzzzzy: think thats his back emote
[0:38:21] MacYodaNL: its the joke emote i think when she gets to be a mechanical horse
[0:38:28] PixelZig: control four
[0:38:42] PixelZig: jk idk
[0:39:36] PixelZig: do you think they practiced this or just 200 iq
[0:39:38] TwiceTSTS: One day we will get this Chovy at Worlds
[0:39:53] Zebrios: This is psychotic confidence
[0:40:28] dah777: 5Head average chovy play
[0:40:28] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:40:34] LautaroQ28: What a beautiful play
[0:40:46] Phaetox: I'm usually very critical of chovy but that was crisp af
[0:41:03] Emilytacular: hi everyone sorry I'm late
[0:41:08] Zebrios: Chovy is an incredibly mechanical player, but man he has got to get over his big stage choking.
[0:41:13] MacYodaNL: i think its as good as his famous Galio get 3 man in river choke point (if somebody remembers)
[0:41:16] LautaroQ28: Well if he can do it here but nto at worlds then maybe he's great just nto consistent?
[0:41:40] najafan: Chovy's not only the best midlaner in KR, he's the best toplaner too. :P
[0:41:40] TwiceTSTS: Chovy is super consistent in LCK, he chokes internationally
[0:41:43] Browhan: then theres me still too lazy to count waves vs neeko
[0:42:00] Zebrios: KDF played that choke so bad.
[0:42:05] MacYodaNL: @TwiceTSTS its not only him, its the GenG international curse
[0:42:07] TB_Honest: people underestimate how much chovy's teammates lose their edge in high pressure circumstances. He is almost always dangerous, just plays in such a self-reliant fashion
[0:42:35] TwiceTSTS: @MacYodaNL It's the curse of buying Samsung's slot
[0:42:42] Zebrios: @TB_Honest I mean... there have been several instances of Chovy straight up collapsing by farming side lanes in big moments internationally.
[0:43:11] MacYodaNL: @TwiceTSTS good point
[0:43:21] Zebrios: Geng looks good, but not nearly as dominant as their first 2 weeks.
[0:43:32] LautaroQ28: Neeko feels like the new LeBlanc with the clones and jukes
[0:43:36] Zebrios: If they play this sloppy vs T1 in the rematch, they're gonna get clapped
[0:43:42] dowiet: b-b-b-b-b-bangers
[0:43:58] TB_Honest: @Zebrios plenty of circumstances i could cite too of his entire team losing while he's 0 0 1 with 12cs/minute

[0:52:12] buttponcho: so here you go
[0:52:17] Shobes572: @montecristo always looking forward to bangers
[0:52:20] Browhan: game 2 of  bds th made me depressed
[0:52:31] Zebrios: @wickedcarouser theoretically, Zac does have a good lane into Ksante though.
[0:52:33] buttponcho: see
[0:52:51] Shobes572: @buttponcho love the name
[0:52:56] buttponcho: watching this makes me depressed as an EU-supporter honestly
[0:53:00] bull3271: your longshot bet on cloud9 going 0-3 is looking good lol
[0:53:02] buttponcho: @Shobes572 thanks!
[0:53:06] livid_poptart: is there any where I can watch the Baldurs Gate 3 play-through you and DoA did?
[0:53:08] Zebrios: Andil seems good on enchanters.  I think he struggles with engage champs
[0:53:19] livid_poptart: @buttponcho LEC has been so rough recently PoroSad
[0:53:25] Browhan: namis ulting chokes lec take notes
[0:53:28] Browhan: Lul
[0:53:44] SomeFerretGuy: xdd
[0:53:48] Zebrios: Dgon is a baller.
[0:53:55] Stormserpent101: i made 140 off flyquest
[0:53:57] Discoshell: Can you explain why teams dont make it a prio to ban/1st pick K'sante?
[0:53:58] SaltineCracker94: wow
[0:53:59] buttponcho: he also said IMT 3-0 so I think he's not doing perfectly
[0:54:06] Zebrios: Bull in elo hell this series
[0:54:09] Zoogs: What key signals convinced him to make that bet?
[0:54:11] Stormserpent101: c9 fly was 2.8 for some reason
[0:54:19] rilsolo: kiin was soo good this game
[0:54:21] Browhan: saw he made a debut on the lcs broadcast
[0:54:41] Zebrios: @MonteCristo I think KDF was looking at the ticking Aphelios clock and panic baron'd
[0:55:04] archie7497: @montecristo I'm surprised dgon bet on the match when he knew he would appear on broadcast. All talent in csgo are barred from betting.
[0:55:18] LautaroQ28: This happened the last time you reviewed them as well
[0:55:51] Browhan: other team has no flashes too thougj

[0:55:55] Browhan: though
[0:56:20] DixMX: pogg
[0:56:29] Zebrios: I'm so glad that Kiin finally found a good team.  He suffered long enough.
[0:56:58] buttponcho: I like me some Doran but these are overall the best teammates Chovy's ever had by a good margin
[0:57:12] Browhan: yeah makes sense, but maybe that played a part in the baron decision
[0:57:15] buttponcho: Hopefully he can show his prime at worlds this year :(
[0:57:35] najafan: How good is Kiin at midlane?
[0:57:53] Zebrios: I think a lot of teams try to copy the T1 baron forces, but don't do the whole setup so they fail.
[0:58:14] MacYodaNL: yeah feels like they are rushing plays when taking it normal pace would give more space and opportunities on the map
[0:58:15] suprimo114: hopefully kdf are not another lsb from last year where they fall off
[0:58:17] GiLLzzzzy: any esports/league betting podcasts you know of?
[0:58:24] LautaroQ28: But those mistakes cost them the game with the pick comp with AD LB and Lee Sin even if they stayed long enough in that game
[0:58:37] Browhan: Bulldog looks pretty legit also
[0:58:38] LautaroQ28: Or did they win that one? I forgot
[0:58:52] Kufner: wow massive turn by dudu
[0:58:56] Zebrios: Except Ksante
[0:58:59] Zebrios: Ksante'ing
[0:58:59] catast999: this is a ksante momment
[0:59:01] WashedxUp222: Kiin about to go nuts
[0:59:10] Zebrios: Ksante literally kills 4 people.
[0:59:34] WashedxUp222: he hit every q3 tho
[0:59:38] The_LostProphet: Insert Ksante copy pasta here
[0:59:41] suprimo114: Kiin hit everything and dodged everything
[0:59:42] WashedxUp222: everyone that mattered
[0:59:48] Zebrios: Ksante is busted, honestly.  He needs the Yuumi treatment.
[0:59:52] Kufner: its on bull
[0:59:55] Kufner: u can see the debuff
[0:59:56] moomookus: K'Sante👤4,700 HP💪329 Armor🤷‍♂️201 MR💦 Unstoppable🚫A Shield 🛡 Goes over walls🧱Has Airborne🌪Cooldown is only☝second too🕐 It costs 15 Mana🧙‍♂️
[0:59:57] unzylol777: its on luc
[1:00:05] kitkatbar5: Isn't that last icon on lucian the chains?
[1:00:06] buttponcho: trie
[1:00:09] buttponcho: true
[1:00:10] najafan: Let's be real here, Ksante is tier 0, BUT, Kiin is insane.
[1:00:19] 그렘린1201: i believe chovy has a say in that
[1:00:21] Fissiccisst: I was about to say, the difference between good and bad ksante is night and day
[1:00:45] Yaloshi: kiin is great and ksante is broken - both are true
[1:01:00] SunburnedGore: both are true
[1:01:00] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:01:11] Kufner: one auto did like 400 damage
[1:01:14] 그렘린1201: he was also extremely fed this game
[1:01:15] Fissiccisst: is Ksante just better Pantheon? What pantheon should've been?
[1:01:48] WashedxUp222: That side set is unreal
[1:01:50] vriesea97: holy
[1:01:51] Zebrios: @MonteCristo I think the problem is that KSante's damage output is far too high for how tanky his kit naturally makes him.
[1:01:56] Kufner: 7.8k on a tank still isnt very fair
[1:02:03] kitkatbar5: urf mode ksante
[1:02:05] Browhan: k sante is like old ryze. meh in soloq but obnoxious in pro play
[1:02:05] WashedxUp222: was that completely blind or did that red ward in bush see it?
[1:02:06] Discoshell: Why do teams let K'sante through? Even tho Kiin is insane, wtf?
[1:02:07] IEatLamas: I meeean
[1:02:11] moomookus: K'Sante👤4,700 HP💪329 Armor🤷‍♂️201 MR💦 Unstoppable🚫A Shield 🛡 Goes over walls🧱Has Airborne🌪Cooldown is only☝second too🕐 It costs 15 Mana🧙‍♂️ 󠀀
[1:02:16] spinifex: yeah but like 5 dashes
[1:02:17] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: That was disgusting in the best way possible
[1:02:19] SunburnedGore: K'Sante👤4,700 HP💪329 Armor🤷‍♂️201 MR💦 Unstoppable🚫A Shield 🛡 Goes over walls🧱Has Airborne🌪Cooldown is only☝second too🕐 It costs 15 Mana🧙‍♂️
[1:02:26] buttponcho: Ksante is too strong, but this does not take away from the way Kiin operated him
[1:02:38] Shimmerz: get the copy pastas out
[1:02:42] The_LostProphet: Kiin rocked and abused that Ksante
[1:02:42] Kufner: yea nothing against kiin put a great player on a overloaded champ
[1:02:45] Fissiccisst: hate the champ, not the player LUL
[1:02:49] Zebrios: @MonteCristo It's a good play, but if he's on a different top laner, does that fight go the same way?
[1:02:51] IEatLamas: I guess one mistake and he doesn't get that
[1:02:56] awoogawooogawoo: i hate both ksante and aatrox LUL
[1:03:00] najafan: Kiin went 1v3, yeah
[1:03:01] suprimo114: western ksante doesn’t do this
[1:03:05] najafan: Shouldn't be possible.
[1:03:16] moomookus: Kiin played it perfectly but holy moly this champ lol
[1:03:30] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: but... the MECHANICS
[1:03:42] Browhan: his q3s too so clean
[1:03:43] QuackTheDuck: Ksante is just broken
[1:03:44] Fissiccisst: not that it matters that much, but water dragon was also shooting aatroxc
[1:03:44] squirrelnuts077: he can dodge cus he has a million dashes
[1:03:45] Discoshell: Team, guys, remember level aswell
[1:03:46] awoogawooogawoo: ikwym
[1:03:50] Zebrios: He outplays it, but he also has several dashes.
[1:03:50] imZenlol: that E shield go bonkers lol
[1:03:54] Browhan: the doublt
[1:03:58] doggo01610: bro , tanks shouldnt suppose to do that . a tank that can one shot carries
[1:04:12] QuackTheDuck: Ksante has so much shield and dash its kinda bonkers
[1:04:13] LautaroQ28: The champ might be whatever but this play was all Kiin
[1:04:19] IEatLamas: As soon as he ults hes not a tank
[1:04:30] spinifex: u would think so
[1:04:32] 오역: nah even if dudu hit everything that e shield dash is too crazy
[1:04:32] najafan: I think maybe the over the wall might be survivable. But yes, Kiin went crazy.
[1:04:32] buttponcho: Ksante is slightly easier Riven with way more upside for less input
[1:04:33] LautaroQ28: @doggo01610 that has been a thing since S8 though lol
[1:04:37] The_LostProphet: That level difference doesnt help either
[1:04:40] signaturr: peyz this fight ?
[1:04:41] Clyde1500: don't hate the player hate the game
[1:04:55] doggo01610: and you can turn it  off or cancel the ult after you kill the carry ,
[1:05:01] weak_mental_renekton: is bull and bulldog the best mid bot names?
[1:05:07] rilsolo: that small movement to dodge q2 from aatrox jesus
[1:05:09] Discoshell: Idd, if it was Zeus ppl would jerk off
[1:05:11] bull3271: q3 is sexy
[1:05:24] DixMX: I'm taking a break from painting to eat pizza and watch Bangers Only, life is good!
[1:05:25] awoogawooogawoo: he saw q1 aatrox
[1:05:34] IEatLamas: I like ksante tho he has a high skill cap, random players can't do that. I like champs like that idk why we balance by thinking 'hes op if you're the best in the world", on any champ. People have to play around them then and figure it out
[1:05:36] awoogawooogawoo: i thought its predict q
[1:05:37] QuackTheDuck: I mean when you combine broken champ with good player you get ksante moments
[1:05:50] moomookus: I wish Delight and Viper were on GenG Sadge
[1:06:09] Tears_0f_sin: no shot i woulda even realized my ghost came back up mid fight

[1:06:29] Fissiccisst: its always hard cause items drastically shift what champs become good or bad, in a different item era, ksante could be much worse without the ones he's running now
[1:06:36] QuackTheDuck: is ksante even killable with ocean soul?
[1:06:44] doggo01610: just remove 3rd skill dash of ksante and he will balance , too much dashes
[1:06:45] CrazyTheConfused: i dont think so LUL
[1:06:48] Zebrios: @QuackTheDuck Not really, no
[1:06:52] beluga_12_3: this is kiins world and dudu is just living in it
[1:06:56] bull3271: giga carry
[1:06:57] LautaroQ28: In the last 3 fights we've seen Ori has been without mana as well
[1:06:58] TheNorseCrow: Kiin played like a beast. Saying the champion is OP diminishes just how good the player is.
[1:06:59] lMSOMANIAC: 5k hp LUL
[1:06:59] Discoshell: Kiin is a OPM villain, wtf
[1:07:09] imZenlol: he for sure played well
[1:07:11] catast999: have u seent the dudu ksante highlight
[1:07:15] Professional_Aellith: I can't wait until Ksante gets the pre-rework Evelynn treatment and thrown into the gutter for years
[1:07:30] saberaxe: credit to Kiin but that champ is disgusting
[1:07:31] Kufner: which is the right choice
[1:07:34] doggo01610: ksante is basically garen but with 3 dashes
[1:07:36] fishstall: thanks for streaming on youtube as well
[1:07:51] Zebrios: Teams should never, ever let Ksante through draft in the game's current state.
[1:08:00] awoogawooogawoo: I prefer to watch lfn on youtube than twitch
[1:08:03] buttponcho: I was on youtube but now I am a sub so I gotta use the thing cristoRACCOON
[1:08:04] Zebrios: 30k Ksante
[1:08:05] IEatLamas: How good did KDF looks here tho, I loved this game
[1:08:08] imZenlol: twitch allowed streamer to interact with youtube viewers?
[1:08:08] QuackTheDuck: garen is not as tanky as ksante
[1:08:09] Fissiccisst: YT and Twitch seem like different circles
[1:08:09] TheNorseCrow: I prefer the Twitch layout personally
[1:08:10] saberaxe: Zac is actually a good counter thats been brought out
[1:08:11] Zebrios: tank btw
[1:08:14] najafan: I still recommend using the restream bot to link the chats
[1:08:23] Raydriar: youtube is great for idle listening
[1:08:25] wankejj: youtube is its own audience i think
[1:08:26] Apathetic_Brent: I have no fucking idea why twitch still doesnt have dvr.  That's 90% of the reason I watch shit on YT if it's an option.
[1:08:43] gerbilsdontexist: Showmaker's kid first words is going to be 4700 HP
[1:08:44] WashedxUp222: youtube is so nice bc you can pause and rewind
[1:08:48] fishstall: when i was lurking on i was on youtube but when I want to be in the community I watch on twitch
[1:08:50] docallens: @Apathetic_Brent it's expensive to implement
[1:08:54] Dreamchosis: i feel like the live discoverability is bad but it will show your stream if their algo would usually show your  content, so its good
[1:08:56] QuackTheDuck: @WashedxUp222 this 100%
[1:09:03] awoogawooogawoo: My main reason is i can rewind jokes you or thorin maked
[1:09:03] buttponcho: I listen to it as a podcast and youtube premium is just much better than twitch in the background
[1:09:04] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo youtube is MUCH more ad friendly when you have adblock, twitch you are stuck with ads......thats prob why
[1:09:20] Shobes572: @montecristo I like being able to listen and keep YT in the background or while phone is locked
[1:09:28] Krethas: youtube is really nice when you can't catch a live show exactly on time. When I tune into power spike or SI 15 minutes late, I just set it to 1.5x speed to catch up to live eventually
[1:09:29] fishstall: the ability to choose is much appreciated we don't mind being ignored on youtube
[1:09:33] saltywalty1337: @MonteCristo I will NEVER pay for YT Premium
[1:09:34] Fissiccisst: Do you get add rev from twitch turbo members?
[1:09:36] doggo01610: twitch viewers just like memes , youtube viewers like conversations and analysis
[1:09:39] Fissiccisst: ad rev*
[1:09:51] dowiet: the adblock for youtube is very nice
[1:09:51] najafan: @Dreamchosis tbh, yt live is just a side project for them, so they're never gonna invest in discoverability, lol
[1:09:51] LautaroQ28: YT premium is a great package overall, family plan is up to 6 accounts
[1:10:04] QuackTheDuck: I mean KDF showed signs of life that they arent a BRO tier team
[1:10:05] TheNorseCrow: YouTube is a better media player but I prefer Twitch's layout for being part of chat.
[1:10:08] Discoshell: Youtube premium? wtf is that? Another sub inc?
[1:10:23] awoogawooogawoo: Is youtube premium much cheaper in korea?
[1:10:29] LautaroQ28: And even if you lag a little, you can still watch the stream at 1080p instead of buffering all the time
[1:10:35] buttponcho: Youtube premium is legitimately a good investment. I've used youtube for like... 14 years might as well pay them money? duh?
[1:10:35] DixMX: and you get YT Music as well
[1:10:37] Rumblextristana: Not to take anything away from Kiin but game 1 was a K'sante diff.
[1:10:49] DixMX: I've been listening to LFN shows on YT Music recently, pretty good
[1:11:06] doggo01610: and yoube only has 2 5-10 sec ads , while twitch has 3 , 30sec ads and unskippable
[1:11:08] TheNorseCrow: Rell is a jungler now? HUH

[1:11:28] DixMX: @TheNorseCrow since last year
[1:11:31] fishstall: I am very new to esports and league i feels very frustrating to watch the four horsemen and not seeing waves of outrage created. Was Ostridge like behavior the norm?
[1:11:33] awoogawooogawoo: wait you have 7tv add on chat? lsGIGA
[1:11:40] FrenchSaga: Hi Monte, hoping everything is going well much love
[1:11:40] TheNorseCrow: @DixMX I've missed out on a lot I see
[1:12:10] Discoshell: Thank god, finally K'sante ban.
[1:12:50] DixMX: no you see, "Last Free Nation" is a right wing dog whistle Kappa
[1:12:52] gerbilsdontexist: am surprised to not see Darius more often as an udyr counter
[1:12:53] IEatLamas: What happened with ostridge?
[1:13:00] Tsojin: Tsojin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[1:13:05] bonacci_versace: darius too stronk
[1:13:09] del1nquency: hey monte, looking forward to the heat podcast, just rewatched it last night
[1:13:17] lMSOMANIAC: Makes me really appreciate what we had with OGN
[1:13:19] Apathetic_Brent: @MonteCristo Do you think Esports are slowly dying or do you think some new title is needed to reinvigorate it?
[1:13:20] bonacci_versace: does anyone play chogath at top tier lol

[1:13:23] TheBasedTaka: i think the fact that no one cares about vanguard the chinese spyware is soo weird
[1:13:35] RakiTeach: Hi Monte,big fan of the LFN culture,loved the Christmas theme one. Have You heard of Collateral with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx,really underrated movie
[1:13:57] Tears_0f_sin: palworld on it's way to take over
[1:13:58] Nekor_: Less dieng more of it going into Stagnation I guess
[1:14:02] gerbilsdontexist: what we need is a new game Monte. the esport/moba scene is so stagnated! it's all league and fps games
[1:14:04] najafan: @DixMX tbf, the pirate imagery is a little dodgy. I mean, the parrots and everything. There's a real concern with people getting parrots as pets and not treating them right. :(
[1:14:06] Nekor_: Until the next big hit
[1:14:13] LautaroQ28: Collateral is great
[1:14:26] buttponcho: lol
[1:14:26] LautaroQ28: One of the best TC works that is not just running and breaking his legs
[1:14:29] Discoshell: Lmao
[1:14:31] buttponcho: Vi, stands for Turd
[1:14:37] RomanticCreampie: i love it when monte goes offtopic
[1:15:11] RakiTeach: @LautaroQ28 It's one of those movies you see its on TV and you are just "ah lets give it a try" and it turns out to be amazing.
[1:15:13] IEatLamas: I mean league and CS take a lot of skill and time to build it, a new game coming out would have to have something similar but would take time to get established
[1:15:31] gerbilsdontexist: those misions are WAILING on them!
[1:15:39] gerbilsdontexist: that's basic league. WHY ARE YOU IN THE MINION WAVE
[1:15:39] LautaroQ28: Indeed Raki, though at least for me it's a pretty well known movie
[1:15:52] fishstall: why would a mid laner invade the jungler early? What is the potential gain?
[1:16:00] IEatLamas: There's a reason why the most basic sports are the biggest ones like football
[1:16:17] buttp0undr420: Which judges' palms must we grease in order to strip devs' IP rights with regards to esports

[1:16:26] LautaroQ28: You can damage the jungler and make them be low level and waste a bunch of time
[1:16:32] WashedxUp222: if i recall payz had a mid performance this game
[1:16:39] najafan: @buttp0undr420 Either congress or SCOTUS.
[1:16:42] gerbilsdontexist: Peyz is mid so that makes sense
[1:17:11] DixMX: @najafan sadly no one's going to touch them
[1:17:16] WashedxUp222: @carneasadaenjoyer g1 was decent lol but yeah... Ruler FeelsBadMan
[1:17:40] najafan: @DixMX Is Harlan Crow a gamer?
[1:18:15] fishstall: @najafan the dallas buisnessman?
[1:18:22] jpegexe: and chovy warded for the crab
[1:18:53] dowiet: double bubble ur in trouble
[1:19:02] najafan: @fishstall Well, yes, but that's not the salient feature in the context of greasing the palms of judges.
[1:19:24] Krethas: Peyz in the last few series hasn't felt the same as his breakout rookie year. Meta change? Team focusing more on top size?
[1:19:24] Shobes572: A lot of lucians with Lee syndrome today
[1:20:06] gerbilsdontexist: Kiin Canyon Chovy is the strongest top side I have ever seen in recent Memory @MonteCristo
[1:20:12] IEatLamas: Bullish

[1:20:27] DixMX: insane flash

[1:20:45] Arig4r: "almost"
[1:20:47] gerbilsdontexist: Nami needed to follow up on him
[1:20:51] RomanticCreampie: did he feel forced because they'd get dived?
[1:20:53] IEatLamas: Bull is amazing just needs to rough out the edges
[1:20:58] buttp0undr420: Always wurf
[1:21:09] Fioraoraoraoraoraoraora: lost all minions too
[1:21:10] killerpineapple1: was not expecting the double milo shield prob thought there was only 1cd
[1:21:12] FuHua_HoS: tbf, if nami flash auto, that was also a kill :)
[1:21:13] signaturr: @carneasadaenjoyer idt nami knew he would do that lol
[1:21:22] DixMX: I always thought Bull and BuLLDoG were the same player
[1:21:22] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:21:25] Tears_0f_sin: he loses a ton of minions also even if he gets the kill
[1:21:27] Discoshell: Would Lee be a better pick instead of Vi? Or the engage is to important?
[1:21:32] najafan: True, Nami shouldn't be a coward
[1:21:38] IEatLamas: Do they get dove still?
[1:21:41] saltywalty1337: nami e also late?
[1:21:45] gerbilsdontexist: i dont mind that Bull play. Andill needed to be on the same page
[1:21:57] buttponcho: Ok gotta go to bed good stream everyone
[1:21:57] bull3271: no way it is woth it with the wave crashing event if he get the kill
[1:22:11] Hangado: don't they have to give the waves either way?
[1:22:17] killerpineapple1: i not he kills both and prob only trades himself back and resets his bounty still super risky
[1:22:50] buttp0undr420: He has the killer instict but can he engage in mortal combat?
[1:22:59] RomanticCreampie: chovy still not chugged his pot vs early game akali
[1:23:08] Shobes572: Canyon just up cuzz's bum this whole game lol
[1:23:09] Quanze_: Hey, Monte. I know u dont have a fixed schedule because of the baby but when do you normally stream and at what time?
[1:23:15] Shobes572: Smothered
[1:23:17] gerbilsdontexist: i dont know why caitlyn isnt picked more.
[1:23:23] gerbilsdontexist: and miss fortune as well
[1:23:27] najafan: Double support item on Gen
[1:23:30] LautaroQ28: I think currently at this time quanzept

[1:24:02] grandezelx: its nit next week
[1:24:04] najafan: @quanzept He's been starting 10-12ish EST, usually.
[1:24:04] IEatLamas: Yeah why no mf in pro? Too hard to make a comp around?
[1:24:08] ScruffyMcgruff350: im diana one trick but only in wild rift :( ... trying to learn real league PC. Is she good mid/jungle in PC?
[1:24:08] najafan: But it varies
[1:24:12] RomanticCreampie: hexdrinker first wtf
[1:24:21] gerbilsdontexist: mf just makes so much sense in pro right now
[1:24:21] grandezelx: next week lunar new year holiday
[1:24:22] dbird901: @ScruffyMcgruff350 she's good jungle for sure
[1:24:22] najafan: Convert that into your time
[1:24:23] suprimo114: should be 14.2 since they are off next week
[1:24:30] LautaroQ28: @LautaroQ28 I'm from South America so Korean times are super off for me lol 12 hours diff
[1:24:42] WashedxUp222: that'd be awesome bc im EST
[1:25:09] ScruffyMcgruff350: @dbird901 yay sick. i have to learn all these new items and other items with diff stats
[1:25:09] Discoshell: Idk, still hate Vi into this matchup. Vi is so useless 1-6
[1:25:15] KingsEntourage: It isn't random. It is for Valorant. They just don't fully admit it.
[1:25:15] killerpineapple1: yes
[1:25:17] dowiet: random couple months off LUL
[1:25:18] WashedxUp222: BuT ThErEs SoMeThInG PlAnEd
[1:25:18] killerpineapple1: its so stupid
[1:25:19] Clyde1500: isn't there a break soon for VCTZ?
[1:25:20] buttp0undr420: Don't watch LCS anymore so don't care
[1:25:22] Clyde1500: VCT*
[1:25:23] IEatLamas: Still don't watch LCS
[1:25:42] WashedxUp222: LUL

[1:25:57] livid_poptart: OMEGALUL
[1:25:57] SaltineCracker94: LUL
[1:26:03] DixMX: yeah that was so weird LUL
[1:26:04] killerpineapple1: theres going to be a new patch when they come back too
[1:26:10] saltywalty1337: GENIUS
[1:26:11] Zoogs: RIOT is DUBM
[1:26:13] WashedxUp222: This is like going to a college town on break LUL
[1:26:15] Jeffp2662: lets be honest. the people at riot don't know when the super bowl is
[1:26:21] lazink: Exa ctly what I thought as well
[1:26:21] LautaroQ28: Are they going to play during the Superball? What the F
[1:26:22] Clyde1500: Is valo taking a break next week?

[1:26:23] MacYodaNL: I guess they relly dont like viewers
[1:26:24] najafan: They're trying to start a culture war with Taylor Swift? idk
[1:26:27] Tameimpala2: well duh, people will obviously choose LCS over superbowl
[1:26:27] weak_mental_renekton: can they not change it now?
[1:26:29] Quanze_: I am starting to believe Riot doesnt actually care about LCS
[1:26:30] Call_Me_Xray: it’s someone’s bday
[1:26:31] JakeJr: LCS is honestly a joke.
[1:26:31] LautaroQ28: Even non americans know about superball
[1:26:32] Zoogs: Don't act so surprised @MonteCristo
[1:26:32] TheBasedTaka: but monte the commissioner is going to save the lcs
[1:26:33] Discoshell: What about us over in EU? Kappa
[1:26:35] Cipherflare: cristoLCS cristoRACCOON
[1:26:36] buttp0undr420: At this point I'm convinced it's a demoralization compaign
[1:26:39] minderbinder141: idk monty kinda reminds of when they let you go...that level of stupid
[1:26:40] dowiet: challenge : impossible
[1:26:41] gerbilsdontexist: idk what to tell you Monte
[1:26:41] Poteightoe: bunch of nerds dont know what football is
[1:26:42] Phaetox: That is pretty funny tbh
[1:26:42] Bladetykon: they are so stupid since they don't have to be smart
[1:26:42] weak_mental_renekton: MonteCristo Superbowl Liveview?
[1:26:45] Benemort: Really testing the limits of Hanlon's Razor here
[1:26:45] AnAnonymousGifter: An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to madlife!  
[1:26:46] midwesternmarley: What is this Superb Owl?
[1:26:48] profound23: that is actually dumb af
[1:27:00] DixMX: when I first read "after Week 4" I thought it was normal, but then I remembered LCS has only 6 weeks LUL wtf
[1:27:01] Clyde1500: Isn't the break for valorant to use the studio?
[1:27:02] eric101101101101: its on purpose so they can disband lcs
[1:27:03] JakeJr: Why do you think the scheduling is like this? The orgs? Riot?
[1:27:11] KingsEntourage: @Clyde1500 they won't say this is the reason
[1:27:12] SunburnedGore: is it becuz val
[1:27:18] GiLLzzzzy: it's for 3 weeks not 2
[1:27:24] Tameimpala2: Why did the NFL schedule the superbowl during a LCS regular split matches?
[1:27:26] lMSOMANIAC: @Clyde1500 Ohh that would make sense then
[1:27:29] SomeFerretGuy: does madlife do anything other than play ffxiv raids now>
[1:27:30] Apathetic_Brent: @midwesternmarley It's the day that we all witness the majesty of Superb Owls.
[1:27:42] KingsEntourage: it is for 2 weeks. But the week before break they won't have fans in house cuz splitting office
[1:27:57] KingsEntourage: due to valorant
[1:28:08] Discoshell: C9 needs to practice a little bit more
[1:28:10] DixMX: that's so bullshit
[1:28:10] killerpineapple1: idk how valo makes them money theres like only little pros and if your going to go pro in a shooter you might as well do CS2 cuz you will actually make money as a player
[1:28:12] Shobes572: It's ok chat, counting is hard
[1:28:15] zunderbunder: is this the return to League casting?! xdd
[1:28:17] KingsEntourage: They just didn't want to admit it was for valorant
[1:28:24] lazink: It is so when they have low numbers they can use the superbowl as an excuse
[1:28:29] DixMX: Riot just hates LCS or what LUL
[1:28:53] najafan: @killerpineapple1 I'm pretty sure valo makes them a ton of money, they've actually given some numbers.
[1:29:03] IEatLamas: Phreak was going on vacation so.. couldn't do much
[1:29:07] najafan: Like, >100 million
[1:29:16] WashedxUp222: @najafan you mean tarrik LUL
[1:29:30] DixMX: don't worry, Finals is gonna be in the studio!
[1:29:31] zunderbunder: Lcs MUST make the least of every league region
[1:29:31] Quanze_: Dumb Question: How does the League have a profit with costreamers? Baiano today had 50 k viewers while CBLOL was at 5k viewers
[1:29:32] dannyridsdale01: could be some complex small legal issue they can't share
[1:29:35] BorbyJr: LCS has sucked since season 5
[1:29:37] killerpineapple1: @killerpineapple1 well i mean specifically there pro league, they make more money there than LOL simply because of skin pushing for guns
[1:29:51] JakeJr: the fact that the LCS doesn't even try to practice bo3 format in seasonal play is just dumb.
[1:29:56] leamfor: @ItOnlyHurts You must have been in a coma since then
[1:29:56] Tameimpala2: I think its brave of the NFL to compete with the LCS by scheduling the Superbowl during prime time LCS
[1:30:23] Discoshell: Thank god we picked Vi guys!
[1:30:34] BorbyJr: very brave
[1:30:40] triggerzugz: just joined. can you talk about what it is specifically that allows top Korean teams to be up or even in gold while down 5-8 kills? is this  solely better laning or more trading kills for plates? or both? I don't see this as much in other reasons
[1:30:43] Fissiccisst: am I dumb thinking Yone is just busted af?
[1:30:48] IEatLamas: LCS is only BO1? You kidding me
[1:30:49] triggerzugz: regions*
[1:30:50] grandezelx: @MonteCristo i am getting triggered by the missing monte doa comment every week how are you not pissed off
[1:31:00] buttp0undr420: Yone still just completely unreasonable
[1:31:03] Quanze_: @Fissiccisst it is Chovy Yone tho
[1:31:05] najafan: @killerpineapple1 There's been some discussion of it, I'm pretty sure it actually does. Same as always, advertising. And they also have team skins iirc.
[1:31:07] leamfor: @IEatLamas Been in a coma since 2018?
[1:31:30] aBitTooHircine: nostalgia is a hell of a drug
[1:31:30] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:31:55] IEatLamas: @leamfor didn't watch NA league since TSM my dude
[1:32:03] killerpineapple1: @killerpineapple1 well LOL skin is like what average 3-5 bucks for basic ones and the lowest one for valo is like 15
[1:32:04] gerbilsdontexist: that Vi damage tho
[1:32:08] TheBasedTaka: monte doa tastetosis favorite duos
[1:32:15] buttp0undr420: Poor cuzz
[1:32:20] leamfor: @IEatLamas since TSM? Since TSM what?
[1:32:22] Discoshell: I dont remember, what was the jung prio?
[1:32:31] rilsolo: canyon trying to turn tank champs into carry champs
[1:32:36] gerbilsdontexist: i dont remember the last time i saw a Vi do well in LCK
[1:32:47] najafan: @killerpineapple1 But surely that just means any advertising for the skins is more efficient. So clearly it makes money.
[1:32:47] zunderbunder: any explanation the the double support item bot? Im pretty behind on meta
[1:32:51] TwiceTSTS: Peanut had a great Vi game
[1:33:11] IEatLamas: @leamfor there was more than one tsm? since like S3/4 ig
[1:33:16] gerbilsdontexist: Monte what is your favorite league related meme/copypasta ?
[1:33:41] najafan: @zunderbunder On 14.1 it's pretty easy to manage the items so each person can get the increased gold from support items without getting penalized.
[1:33:47] najafan: This was nerfed in 14.2
[1:33:50] Fissiccisst: @carneasadaenjoyer cristoTSM ROTATIONS cristoTSM
[1:33:51] Discoshell: @carneasadaenjoyer TSM 2024?
[1:34:01] zunderbunder: @najafan damn. They done it again
[1:34:10] zunderbunder: ohhh ok
[1:34:13] leamfor: @IEatLamas Dude, this is the first split that TSM didn't exist, so saying "since TSM" literally means nothing. If you hadn't watched since S3/S4, then LCS being Bo1 isn't new.
[1:34:13] zunderbunder: thats good
[1:34:37] TheBasedTaka: eulcs needs to hire more observers so they can get those angles
[1:34:53] Quanze_: lowkey i dont think udyr doesnt have counters
[1:34:55] Discoshell: Whaat?
[1:35:07] zunderbunder: kdf not playing like a 3-2 team... or is Geng just that good lmao
[1:35:15] DixMX: I hate loving Gen.G cuz you see them doing this in LCK but internationally they don't do shit
[1:35:17] gerbilsdontexist: he really said Shrekin them
[1:35:35] jellyfishtrain: Unlike lec where pretty sure they laid off replay person Kapp
[1:35:37] IEatLamas: @leamfor idk. BO1 is bull anyways, should be common knowledge at this point. Back then nobody knew anything
[1:35:40] naocorrijo: geng looks weird in g1s then stomps g2s, just mata diff
[1:35:49] profound23: can give kdf a pass geng is like possibly best team in the world
[1:35:49] Benemort: Why do you think Canyon's tanks have noticeably improved? It feels like a sin to put him on tank duty, but it seems to be working lol
[1:36:07] leamfor: @IEatLamas It was actually Bo3 for 3 split in 2016-2017, and the viewership tanked.
[1:36:19] gerbilsdontexist: yeah. that was Peanut Trademark! he was an international choker!
[1:36:24] IEatLamas: @leamfor NA audience Omegalul
[1:36:28] zunderbunder: need Keane back from tft xdd
[1:36:29] gerbilsdontexist: Peanut is the biggest Choker ever
[1:36:33] Phaetox: And Doran actually looked good lol

[1:36:41] DixMX: true
[1:36:52] IEatLamas: @leamfor I guess it's not just me that find those games boring
[1:36:59] Discoshell: What are you eating?
[1:37:06] gerbilsdontexist: his top laner isn't a bum!
[1:37:13] leamfor: @IEatLamas How would know if you hadn't watched since 2014?
[1:37:17] najafan: @leamfor tbf, I think there's a decent argument that this is because of the core LCS audience growing up and having other stuff to do, since it *never fully recovered*. But it's nuanced.
[1:37:25] livid_poptart: this GenG roster has GOTTA be the one that does something internationally right?
[1:37:40] Phaetox: Canna tilted them all
[1:37:42] gerbilsdontexist: Canyon is the best jungler in the world!
[1:37:56] Phaetox: Canna tilted that team too
[1:38:05] Kufner: I think that notion is kinda true everywhere
[1:38:07] leamfor: @najafan It's more on the failure for Riot to appeal the LCS to newer viewers, since other regions don't have this problem.
[1:38:09] gerbilsdontexist: tbf Monte, 2023 was BDD's best year ever. way better than even before 2022
[1:38:11] zunderbunder: meanwhile everyone in na checked out permanently sadge
[1:38:20] gerbilsdontexist: BDD was straight up the best mid in LCK most of 2023
[1:38:26] Krethas: Peyz this season just hasn't been it
[1:38:45] DixMX: @carneasadaenjoyer no bro, Faker was the Best PC Player of 2023 Kappa
[1:39:07] Phaetox: Delight is cracked
[1:39:09] zunderbunder: need Quantic era C9 back
[1:39:10] IEatLamas: Based take, delight is so fkn good
[1:39:43] najafan: @leamfor Sure. And also LPL and LCK became more popular for western audiences in this time, there was just soooo much league to watch, so you would stop watching LCS in particular. And iirc there might have been some weird LEC/LCS scheduling thing. It's nuanced. It wasn't just Bo3 -> poor viewership, there were a few factors.
[1:39:47] Krethas: Yeah, I was wondering about that too. And whether Canyon+Kiin made GenG focus more on top side at bot's expense
[1:40:04] najafan: I think Bo3 *did* contribute, but it wasn't by any means the only factor.
[1:40:53] Discoshell: Vi into Sej is just terrible..
[1:40:58] leamfor: @najafan Yeah, but that's the take away that Riot took away from it. Having Bo3 while keeping the days on only 2-3 days is just impossible.
[1:40:58] najafan: (Also they had LCS games scheduled against each other because they wanted LCS to be on 2 or 3 days rather than throughout the week, etc etc)
[1:41:08] najafan: It was just a mess.
[1:41:11] LautaroQ28: Daily question of "Monte, what are you eating?"
[1:41:13] generalgreens: i watched LCS a lot before the focus shifted to international tournaments after the first few seasons after season 3
[1:41:31] buttp0undr420: Do you ever flavor your food with the blood of your enemies?
[1:41:54] Discoshell: Ye, next game please
[1:41:54] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:42:07] LautaroQ28: No, he uses salty fanboy tears
[1:42:08] gerbilsdontexist: man, I miss franchising in LCK, seeing random teams pop up and shit on the league was just amazing
[1:42:27] dowiet: love sped up commentary lmao
[1:42:44] Driatin: sounds like a meal for dads
[1:43:12] gerbilsdontexist: @MonteCristo  Monte, Try King oscar olive oil Mackerel, best canned fish in the history of canned fish!
[1:43:17] leamfor: @MonteCristo You have to watch the cringe of C9 vs IMT.
[1:43:23] IEatLamas: I know ppl think ksante is cracked.. but I think the problem is there's not enough Champs that are cracked
[1:43:41] DixMX: funnily enough, LAN didn't have a league system until 2016, so going from quarterly tournaments against LAS to double round robins was so boring
[1:44:11] Kolos94: This is the fastest game of league i have ever seen
[1:44:15] najafan: @carneasadaenjoyer ESC Ever, never forget
[1:44:16] Discoshell: West, this is how you play Udyr.. Watch and learn.
[1:44:29] triggerzugz: I asked earlier how T1 is managing to have gold leads while down multiple kills so  often. is the lane prio more due to better laning or draft? both equally?
[1:44:49] DixMX: is Gen.G top 2 team in the world right now?
[1:45:06] Phaetox: Canyon kiin is not who you want snowballed against you lol
[1:45:19] TwiceTSTS: Right now the LCK has a faster average game time than the LPL
[1:45:25] generalgreens: is the new geng an upgrade?
[1:45:28] aBitTooHircine: is cuzz in your top 5 lck junglers
[1:45:30] Discoshell: YES
[1:45:30] DixMX: yes!
[1:45:33] NexusRein: what players/teams have you been pleasantly surprised by so far?
[1:45:36] Komarimasita: yessss
[1:45:41] naocorrijo: do players too pls
[1:45:46] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo you watch LCS games? thought you dont
[1:46:02] triggerzugz: why is LCS so slow? even if you are going to make mistakes? why not play more proactively?
[1:46:02] bigplaystevizzle: cristoTSM
[1:46:04] rilsolo: he watches lcs to give raccoons food
[1:46:22] Shobes572: cristoLCS cristoRACCOON
[1:46:23] Krethas: I lost interest in LCS because they endlessly rambled on "international success focus" but delivered the exact opposite
[1:46:24] Discoshell: Next game DK or HLE? Or C9 vs IMT?
[1:46:24] TwiceTSTS: C9 probably needs to replace Fudge
[1:46:28] NAAlistar: C9 vs FLY was a fun match to watch
[1:46:28] leamfor: Mispronounced FLY and NRG
[1:46:29] TimrewFI: Shopify with the Sion and Garen mids GIGACHAD
[1:46:33] fIuffee: Thoughts on OkSavingsBank BRION?
[1:46:38] dbird901: @TwiceTSTS they've been needing to do that for a while
[1:46:45] DixMX: @triggerzugz cuz Bo1 discourages taking risks

[1:48:09] leamfor: @najafan Licorice is literally a free agent
[1:48:12] najafan: They need a top who can speak English and fits into their Culture and Systems.
[1:48:19] jellyfishtrain: someone getting yelled at haha
[1:48:20] thelasts1lence: Revenge and Licorice are literally free agents
[1:48:21] DixMX: Licorice or Revenge
[1:48:22] Quanze_: Hello, mr Chair
[1:48:30] Fissiccisst: dolphinChair
[1:48:35] najafan: I'm not convinced Licorice is an upgrade.
[1:48:42] IEatLamas: Fudge and licorice don't go well together
[1:48:43] wiisoka: @leamfor Impact would have been perfect for C9, but TL already took him and he's not going to leave this time. Unless ...
[1:49:03] dbird901: Didn't they have an opportunity to get Wunder?
[1:49:21] najafan: Licorice did well last split, yeah, but we know what he was like prior to that.
[1:49:31] Quanze_: Wunder aint leaving europe, mate
[1:49:40] DixMX: Tenacity is on Disguised too
[1:49:48] gerbilsdontexist: gerbilsdontexist subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:49:54] thelasts1lence: @dbird901 He refused an offer to go to play with his boomer friends in HRT
[1:50:16] leamfor: @najafan Licorice was good all last year, not just last split. In addition, Fudge has been middling for the better part of 2 years at this point.
[1:50:24] leamfor: especially internationally
[1:50:25] trueaether: @MonteCristo have you watched both of C9s prior losses, I recall you did a review of the SR one but idk about the othe
[1:50:26] Zoogs: @MonteCristo Do you think it's possible for top tier junglers to hide their pocket strats to preserve their top tier status from year to year?
[1:50:41] NexusRein: what players form has surprised you the most either positively or negatively
[1:50:47] gerbilsdontexist: man babies are a lot of work
[1:50:49] leamfor: YEP

[1:50:57] TheBasedTaka: id watch
[1:51:00] najafan: @leamfor I think you're overstating his spring performance. He was fine, but still mixed.

[1:51:16] DixMX: @leamfor bro he was ass on Spring regular season, though he definitely improved throughout playoffs and MSI
[1:51:27] WashedxUp222: today was berserker inting twice in the first 10 mins and that was it
[1:51:28] triggerzugz: LCS LCS RaccAttack
[1:51:33] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo the more i learn about kids the more i dont want them LOL, sounds soooooo tiring
[1:51:35] killerpineapple1: to me c9 have good mechanics but 0 map awareness

[1:52:12] DixMX: Pog
[1:52:13] killerpineapple1: the first like year and a half is ass but like yeah
[1:52:17] Rubberdubber69: SCREW children... no thank you
[1:52:17] buttp0undr420: I can't wait to have at least 4 kids
[1:52:23] the_stuu: the first 6 weeks are absolute hell
[1:52:27] gerbilsdontexist: everyone hates babies
[1:52:31] Quanze_: Babies are only funny and cute for the others, not for the parents
[1:52:31] dbird901: it's a lot harder taking care of a being that can't communicate and isn't independent
[1:52:31] IEatLamas: Me too buttpounder, me too
[1:52:37] Rihll_: @Shobes572 Thanks for the gift sub! cristoWOLF
[1:52:41] dbird901: as they get older it gets a lot better
[1:52:46] DixMX: it's definitely rewarding seeing them grow
[1:52:48] killerpineapple1: around when they start learning to speak
[1:52:54] StealingYoIPZ: women love babies till they get pregnant LOL
[1:52:54] JakeJr: Kids are awesome, they're just a lot of work, a lot of which isn't great while you're in the trenches with it
[1:52:58] Jeffp2662: my wife is obsessed with babies
[1:53:02] killerpineapple1: and you can teach em things is when things get fun
[1:53:03] buttp0undr420: Babies are adorable
[1:53:05] najafan: And it's easy to toss out names of theoretically promising players, but C9 is looking for specific things. You can't just plug and play anyone who looks promising into their team. For good or for ill.
[1:53:09] trueaether: nah that's WILD
[1:53:09] killerpineapple1: showing them things for the first time is so rewarding
[1:53:13] najafan: That's just not what C9 wants.
[1:53:15] pandagrog: 5Head wow
[1:53:17] Shobes572: There comes a point where most women go into heat
[1:53:20] leamfor: @DixMX Saying he just improved is crazy. Probably the best player in playoffs and best NA player at MSI
[1:53:20] Phaetox: I thoroughly enjoyed the first year but I got a sugar momma who wanted me to be stay at home dad SeemsGood
[1:53:22] Rodell: Thats why humans have evolved to think babies are cute, becuase they ae dog shit
[1:53:23] kaboos101: isnt the baby craze thimg just baby fever from pheromones and stuff?
[1:53:40] leamfor: @kaboos101 *hormones not pheromones
[1:53:41] liamismyname3: I was living with my mom again briefly years ago, after one night of my teething niece staying over I moved out
[1:53:48] IEatLamas: I want baby, I'll stay up with that lil bitch
[1:53:49] Phaetox: So I wasn't as tired as I would've been if I kept working
[1:54:11] Fissiccisst: What time is it in Korea right now?
[1:54:19] ZxSlippy: Your paternity leave is hangin out with us Monte :D

[1:54:33] buttp0undr420: Google it
[1:54:37] gerbilsdontexist: SAVE SHOWMAKER FROM KELLIN
[1:54:40] pandagrog: Kellin does nothing like usual
[1:54:48] DixMX: @leamfor definitely not best player in playoffs lmao remember Berserker? at MSI sure, but compared to trash isn't really a good comparison
[1:54:58] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo how is rookie?
[1:55:01] Zoogs: I think you are doing a good job. People need to see proper priorities in a world where mental health has destroyed logical thinking.
[1:55:03] WashedxUp222: cristoLCS  Dk playing
[1:55:04] Kufner: lucid got exposed during this game

[1:55:43] Castlewood: montecristo PogUU

[1:55:45] NexusRein: what players form has surprised you the most either positively or negatively
[1:56:22] gerbilsdontexist: Leblanc into Akali just sucks. Akali heals so much off of little poke with Dshield and her insane innate health regen
[1:56:28] Fissiccisst: This is the same comp as last game minus top lol
[1:56:29] gerbilsdontexist: its a great matchup for akali
[1:56:30] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: too damn long
[1:56:33] Phaetox: Kingen aatrox zeka akali
[1:56:34] buttp0undr420: Are there any channels that re-broadcast LCK and LPL for Western timezones or do I just have to resort to VoDs?

[1:59:08] triggerzugz: wait you read fantasy books?
[1:59:10] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: lord of the coffee rings
[1:59:15] Zepharic: wouldn't it be great to have an excuse to get a new mousepad
[1:59:25] NexusRein: how do you rate zeka compared to the other lck midlaners

[2:02:13] najafan: @triggerzugz He's fine. Very limited. But you always know what you're gonna get with him, and he's decent for the popular fantasy market.
[2:02:27] killerpineapple1: is it me or did they remove a lot of the tool tip dmg this season
[2:02:37] stoney_joey: ports or comps Monte?
[2:02:39] Delf2135: @MonteCristo can u do the live game of HLE later today with the analyze i love it
[2:02:43] buttp0undr420: Lucid anything but
[2:02:56] Zoogs: @MonteCristo do you have a list of most active in chat people with no current subscriptions?
[2:03:08] triggerzugz: @najafan who would you consider not limited just so I understand?
[2:03:12] Zepharic: @najafan I agree. His worldbuilding can be really cool but sometimes he goes a little overboard with it. Is very good for mainstream fanastry tho
[2:03:23] garry_leonard: i feel like for the senna lane they particularly struggle if they get killed early. The poke starts to make laning really tough.
[2:03:27] najafan: @triggerzugz Le Guin?
[2:03:33] buttp0undr420: Lucid doing his best Kanavi cosplay
[2:03:41] DrakeAcula: @killerpineapple1 they did and are adding a lot of it back in because they got huge backlash
[2:03:48] wiisoka: @Zepharic Meh, I don't like him, but I have read worse, like Robert Jordan
[2:03:49] najafan: @najafan Erikson?
[2:03:52] gerbilsdontexist: I want Teleport to be removed. MAKE MID LANE FUN AGAIN
[2:03:58] gerbilsdontexist: #REMOVETP
[2:04:18] triggerzugz: I like the world building. how everything could come together. I also blow through books so I need authors with lots of content. he delivers that better than anyone
[2:04:20] IEatLamas: Remember when no one ran tp?
[2:04:33] madiiiman: the spaghetti code in the fly c9 match is so hilarious
[2:04:39] madiiiman: one of the best moments in lcs in years
[2:04:51] Zepharic: @wiisoka Ooof. but I guess I agree Jordan is worse. What would you recommend?
[2:05:05] najafan: Don't get me wrong. His work is *enjoyable*. I just think it's fairly *middling* in terms of literary merit compared to the work of some other authors.
[2:05:23] najafan: I own all of Stormlight.
[2:05:26] PigManDylan: Monte. What do you think about grubs vs drag? How often do grubs really make the difference between getting a tower and not?
[2:05:33] Quanze_: quanzept subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:05:51] dbird901: @najafan nice to see you mention Le Guin
[2:05:52] rogaine_saintvicious2: BASED AF
[2:05:54] garry_leonard: Don't tell DOA your thoughts about wheel of time
[2:05:58] wiisoka: @Zepharic It's hard to recommend a book. But the best fantasy book I've read is Game of Thrones
[2:06:01] dbird901: Wheel of Time blows
[2:06:07] madiiiman: monte if u think the book is bad i cant fathom what u think of the show lmo
[2:06:08] pandagrog: Harry Potter is horrid lmao
[2:06:20] Fissiccisst: Sounds like the old animes with recycled animations LUL
[2:06:23] Tsojin: have you tried name of the wind?
[2:06:26] Zepharic: @najafan I do agree. I think his story telling isn't great. His prose is pretty bad. What are some of the other authors?
[2:06:30] triggerzugz: lmao. this is def a strong opinion
[2:06:31] dowiet: wheel of time is low level vi
[2:06:31] lazink: Robert Jordan discovered how to shift a shawl in 100 different ways
[2:06:33] Aoyos_: @pigmandylan It's actually way deeper than that because the damage buff can open the option to race towers vs objectives
[2:06:34] biggerbeefey: Do you like Brandon Sanderson books?
[2:06:34] thisischuck99: have you tried "the name of the wind"
[2:06:39] Phaetox: Monte have you seen Gentlemen Broncos? Hilarious parodying of scifi books
[2:06:41] krb_19: i felt like i was the only one that doesnt like wheel of time
[2:06:43] Zepharic: @lazink lmao
[2:06:43] najafan: I couldn't get passed Wheel of Time 4. People kept telling me it eventually got better. So I kept trying. But I gave up at book 4.
[2:06:45] nickis211: Guys don't show him our Chinese novels monka
[2:06:49] MrTeapot: above Kappa
[2:06:53] killerpineapple1: got to pump it up
[2:07:02] Fissiccisst: uh oh, Monte's literature rage has been triggered
[2:07:03] Otasteless: Sanderson can’t write either imo
[2:07:05] killerpineapple1: most fantasy is trash
[2:07:11] madiiiman: not always beneath Kappa sometimes its under

[2:07:13] pesukarhupoju: who the hell wants to read fantasy written by a hardcore mormon OMEGALUL
[2:07:15] spucky117: still waiting for monte's book club
[2:07:18] Professional_Aellith: I understand Hyundai/Kia sponsoring a Korean team, but I was surprised to see a NA team with a Hyundai sponsor
[2:07:18] killerpineapple1: and just is like caters to lowkey sexual undertones
[2:07:18] thisischuck99: @MonteCristo "the name of the wind" has really good prose
[2:07:25] weak_mental_renekton: i heard caillou's pretty good
[2:07:35] JakeJr: Monte, roast James S. A. Corey
[2:07:35] Thi3f: I only read RL STINE
[2:07:36] madiiiman: what if instead of beneath, you cross them UNDER
[2:07:40] BinglyTinson: meanwhile tolkien spends 3 pages describing the trees blowing in the wind and ur like wait where am i
[2:07:40] slavosic: Any thoughts on Red Rising by Pierce Brown
[2:07:43] blazeokonogi: favorite sci fi writers?
[2:07:43] aBitTooHircine: I liked George RRs writing
[2:07:46] arlenor94: sci-fi is a subgenre of fantasy Kappa
[2:07:46] NAAlistar: shout out to Hyperion
[2:07:47] najafan: @Zepharic Again, I referenced Le Guin and Erikson. The first Erikson book is, I'll be honest, really bad in terms of prose. And the next two are mid. But he actually gets very good after that. And his themes are insane, the entire thing is a postmodern masterpiece.
[2:07:49] MissingMatter: Gene Wolfe
[2:07:52] madiiiman: @MonteCristo i assume you like enders game?
[2:07:53] Tsojin: @aBitTooHircine no just no
[2:07:53] Fissiccisst: Monte would be ashamed at how few books i've read, but one of my favorites was Ender's Game
[2:07:55] dbird901: @MonteCristo have you read any of Le Guin's stuff? She writes sci fi and fantasy and I think she does great with both
[2:07:55] lazink: Have you read bobiverse?
[2:08:05] reinoisgod: Patrick Rothfuss FeelsGoodMan
[2:08:05] blazeokonogi: name of the wind has good prose for the genre and mediocre everything else
[2:08:06] TheBasedTaka: i only read riot lore
[2:08:08] thisischuck99: yes
[2:08:12] Aoyos_: @hmisay Not only do they sell a lot in the US they're also the car manufacturers involved the most in car theft
[2:08:13] Fissiccisst: well thats when I read it LUL
[2:08:14] PigManDylan: @Aoyos_ I don't ever really see the time when grubs allow you to race a tower that you couldn't race without grub
[2:08:19] MissingMatter: Yeah, Rothfuss's prose is very pretty, and if he ever puts out the third book I'd recommend it more.
[2:08:21] gankedbybear: Alfred Bester for sci fi
[2:08:23] najafan: Rothfuss' prose is good, but the content of what he writes is insufferable.
[2:08:24] thisischuck99: both that and "A wise man's fears" are both really good
[2:08:31] generalgreens: that one about the british magician is pretty good
[2:08:31] Manjiji: name of the wind of overhyped, and 3rd book is never coming out
[2:08:37] achillesreel: Rothfuss just the other end of the neck beard from Sanderson
[2:08:37] IEatLamas: WoW lore DatSheffy
[2:08:39] 2badwtf: man im waiting 10 years for the last book of the series
[2:08:40] imnotkreative11: have you read the Silo series? was thinking of buying the box set heard good things
[2:08:41] madiiiman: enders game was the first book where the twist fucking floored me
[2:08:41] JakeJr: How would you rate The Expanse?
[2:08:42] zunderbunder: I read a lot of pierce anthony when i was younger. Cant remember how good the writing is but i remember loving it back then
[2:08:43] Tsojin: cj cherryh, she does mostly sci fi tho
[2:08:44] madiiiman: i was 15
[2:08:52] 2badwtf: rothfuss is taking his sweet time
[2:08:53] fx_fanslowika: With Rothfuss you need to remember that it has a unreliable narrator that tries to portray himself in the best possible way
[2:09:01] Zepharic: @najafan Erikson is the next series I plan on reading. I've heard quite good things about it. Never read any Le Guin tho
[2:09:04] Fissiccisst: Can we get a grocery list of Monte's top book picks?
[2:09:13] Thi3f: I only like Hank the cowdog and Goosebumps
[2:09:20] wiisoka: @najafan The main character was insufferable
[2:09:26] kshyle: i can't wait to see @MonteCristo react to zeka's corki part 2 LuL
[2:09:28] killerpineapple1: what would be your fav genre ?
[2:09:40] dbird901: @Zepharic check out the Books of Earthsea for Le Guin's fantasy
[2:09:44] Aoyos_: @pigmandylan It's a bunch of hypotheticals that you're better off analyzing after the fact events to see how, if any, influence they had in a given game
[2:09:52] wiisoka: @wiisoka reads like wish fulfillment for incels
[2:09:54] najafan: @Zepharic Le Guin does both sci fi and fantasy. Her fantasy stuff is primarily YA, but it's got very deep feminist and taoist themes.
[2:09:56] dowiet: pizza literature PogBones
[2:09:57] spucky117: whan that april..
[2:10:05] biggerbeefey: I remember everyone calling me an idiot when I said that Battle Royale is the better version of Hunger Games. Look whos laughing now
[2:10:05] lazink: Stranger in a strange land?
[2:10:08] pesukarhupoju: manga of course Kappa
[2:10:10] AC_madsen: @Aoyos_ idk about pro play but the gold and xp from grubs in solo q are super nice if you can get them for free
[2:10:13] blazeokonogi: le guin is excellent. her sci fi is great
[2:10:14] killerpineapple1: hell yeah
[2:10:17] Phaetox: Good writing is rare in any genre
[2:10:17] spucky117: the droocht of march hath perced to the roota
[2:10:18] najafan: Read Foucault's Pendulum, fr fr
[2:10:21] Zepharic: @dbird901 Absolutely will do
[2:10:22] killerpineapple1: thats some shit man lol
[2:10:25] SomeFerretGuy: I don't, I need those wizards D:
[2:10:29] blazeokonogi: I like butler as well
[2:10:31] BinglyTinson: so alright like dune is obviously sci fi but like, mr worm emperor is edging on fantasy to me
[2:10:33] 2badwtf: monte flexing his literacy, disgusting
[2:10:37] madiiiman: monte loved 50 shades
[2:10:37] PigManDylan: @Aoyos_ yea thats what I was trying to ask
[2:10:38] weak_mental_renekton: yk game boring when we talking bout literature
[2:10:38] TomErdenay: Any opinions/thoughts on Erich Maria Remarque?
[2:10:39] Fissiccisst: Aiming almost got decapitated LUL
[2:10:40] Zoogs: yeah but i'm sure you like prefer  sub genre within literature
[2:10:41] Professional_Aellith: Monte’s Roman Empire is the real Roman Empire
[2:10:42] the_stuu: so no lotr?
[2:11:05] PigManDylan: @Aoyos_ that I agree with. It feels like less of a personal sacrifice as a jungler
[2:11:05] Skixxxx: so youre telling me to read the books that faker read, so i become the goat aswell right?
[2:11:06] Camer0n000: after watching team heretics today i see why all the lec players see them as so bad
[2:11:13] Zepharic: @najafan Sounds cool. I'll be sure to put it on the list
[2:11:20] UpYerArs: can you watch the BDS TH series and laugh at how bad Perkz is
[2:11:30] SomeFerretGuy: cristoRACCOON
[2:11:51] nyahken: he's catching the wave
[2:11:53] SomeFerretGuy: perkz in 2024 cristoRACCOON
[2:11:59] Zoogs: lol
[2:12:01] nyahken: he wants the 100g
[2:12:07] UpYerArs: obviously Kellin is the carry he and Aiming being the support (because he has support item) is roaming
[2:12:12] Fissiccisst: is Aiming out of position, or is Kellin?
[2:12:12] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:12:22] najafan: @Zepharic There were a group of booktubers who refused to engage with the themes and complained that all the cool stuff was happening off screen and the story was instead about an angsty wizard staring into the middle distance. I was livid.
[2:12:28] BinglyTinson: @montecristo i assume youre a big fan of virgil from your talks on the aeneid, what do you think about the divine comedy though?
[2:12:29] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: oh you know... hes doing stuff. probs watching the grass grow while attacking minions
[2:12:31] NexusRein: hmm that doesnt sound like kellin at all Clueless
[2:14:02] najafan: Also, any House of Leaves-ers in chat?
[2:14:06] Fissiccisst: I guess in that way, its more like a lane swap, and he's the "top" that swapped bot to be solo while they 3 manned top
[2:14:06] Quanze_: VoidGrubs were such a good change to the game
[2:14:17] blazeokonogi: what did you end up thinking of Emily Wilson’s illiad translation? I thought her odyssey was excellent and am thinking about picking it up @montecristo
[2:14:19] UpYerArs: its still insane to me that GenG decided to not keep Delight
[2:14:37] Zepharic: @najafan I've found booktubers to be pretty basic with critics and reviews. Mostly just jerking off the authors of current series being written
[2:14:49] Fissiccisst: hilariously if aiming had ulted to Kellin, that might've helped
[2:14:59] pandagrog: @UpYerArs how do we know that delight just wanted to play with Viper instead?
[2:15:01] Fissiccisst: instead of wasting it on the kill they already had
[2:15:07] thelasts1lence: DK's map rotation is so weird. Why not put SM on bot side to answer botside and if smth respect the dive and put Naut on mid instead?
[2:15:11] Fissiccisst: hindsight I suppose though
[2:15:11] Aoyos_: If he went mid he makes it more likely for Akali to not cover top lane after the dive
[2:15:22] wiisoka: @najafan I have the full Malazan collection, but didn't started it yet
[2:15:38] BinglyTinson: i think the divine comedy is hilarious because its just dante shitting on his haters
[2:15:54] IEatLamas: This HLE line up should technically do great
[2:16:04] UpYerArs: @UpYerArs Yeah you get Zeka, Peanut and Doran instead of Chovy Kiin Canyon
[2:16:12] achillesreel: The Divine Comedy is literally a fan fic.
[2:16:15] Lecheris_deppth: I really wish they allowed coaches while pros played
[2:16:19] PigManDylan: maybe if the nautilus wasnt level 7
[2:16:40] Fissiccisst: oh man, coaches yelling from the sidelines in comms would make YamatoCanon too powerful
[2:16:47] IEatLamas: Imagine time-outs in league, coaches roasting the players in a pause
[2:16:49] Fissiccisst: hed never lose a game ever again
[2:16:50] wiisoka: @UpYerArs Delight probably got a better offer from HLE. HLE has a lot of money, richest org in the LCK, while GEN is in shambles
[2:17:02] najafan: @wiisoka Again, the first book is rooouuuuuggghhhhhh. Some people have even suggested reading the fifth and then going back to the first. (Because 5 and 1 take place at the same time.) But it's well worth it by the end. But you really need to be willing to suffer through hundreds of pages of just BAD prose.
[2:17:25] UpYerArs: @UpYerArs fair enough makes sense

[2:17:41] killerpineapple1: @Fissiccisst yeah did you ever see the CSGO coach spectator shit you could like just roam the map and give your team info XD
[2:17:50] najafan: I know I sound like a Wheel of Time fan. If you don't like it by Book 4, you're never gonna like it.
[2:17:55] wiisoka: @najafan I know, the first book was suppose to be a screenplay for a movie
[2:18:25] najafan: @wiisoka Actually, that explains a lot.
[2:18:34] mrkatsudonnn: imo HLE is a solid 3rd place team. Will gate keep DK KT from 3rd
[2:18:37] blazeokonogi: has anyone hear read  any N. K. Jameson? Is she legit?
[2:18:53] mjoll_the_hotness: it would spark fire in me if my mid was showmaker
[2:19:01] najafan: @blazeokonogi Jemisin is legit.
[2:19:15] arthradot: so sad that it doesn’t translate into wins most games
[2:19:19] wiisoka: @najafan but it was too "ambitious" and no one wanted to make it
[2:19:26] killerpineapple1: they know how much they can get away with with no response from the other team it is pretty insane micro
[2:19:31] blazeokonogi: ah yes misremembered the name
[2:19:31] wiisoka: @wiisoka so they turned it into a book
[2:19:32] Quanze_: Where did Lucid play before? Challengers?
[2:19:38] lazink: @najafan if you haven't, try Robin Hobb, Assassin's Apprentice
[2:19:39] killerpineapple1: or is that macro idk lol
[2:19:42] najafan: Broken Earth is one of the few series that has substantial portions written in SECOND person.
[2:19:48] najafan: @lazink I've read Hobb.
[2:19:57] PigManDylan: @killerpineapple1 micro is mechanics. Macro is game decisions
[2:20:03] realjellyman: Wheres a good place to start with poetry for someone who has never been into it?
[2:20:31] killerpineapple1: @killerpineapple1 i guess then its a bit of both then right? just trying to make sure I speak correctly
[2:20:44] achillesreel: @realjellyman Any intro to poetry book. Find what you like, go from there.
[2:20:47] Discoshell: Do we get these on youtube? Need to piss off to work..
[2:20:51] arthradot: @quanze_ yep. but he was never called up bc he had to compete with canyon for the spot
[2:20:53] thelasts1lence: From what I see Lucid is very good in creating picks and ganks his solo lanes, but man he is so desynchronized with his botlane sometimes
[2:21:17] najafan: Oh, also, Susannah Clarke is fantastic.
[2:21:25] kradoucksticks: @discoshell yes he uploads vods to youtube
[2:21:26] achillesreel: @achillesreel Personal favorite is Lord Byron
[2:21:36] najafan: Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell + Piranesi are both fantastic.
[2:21:40] MonteCristo: !vods
[2:21:40] Moobot: @MonteCristo Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:21:41] killerpineapple1: i think the more broken thing is taking it from mid to another lane lol
[2:21:43] lazink: @najafan read the recluse series?
[2:21:45] killerpineapple1: thats hella wack
[2:21:45] marson_28: That is true, its easy to mess up with the new Herald
[2:21:46] mrkatsudonnn: I hope Lucid is making his own decision rather than following SM's instruction
[2:22:27] najafan: @lazink I read the first one and it just didn't grab me. It was a little too old style fantasy for me.

[2:24:07] vsmilotic: D- LUL
[2:24:20] IEatLamas: Maokai?
[2:24:43] mrkatsudonnn: Tahm? not sure if its ban

[2:25:17] belminkaric10: dont you miss oldschool league of legends, think its to childy and "woke" now ?
[2:25:18] kradoucksticks: i swear eastern lucians do more damage
[2:25:21] killerpineapple1: @mrkatsudonnn feels bad vs nami you get bubbled every dive or atleast should
[2:25:38] SomeFerretGuy: @belminkaric10 the heck agenda are you on weirdChamp
[2:25:41] e6merald6: next week lck is in 4.2 I think
[2:25:42] pandagrog: @belminkaric10 bro said "woke" LMAO FailFish
[2:25:42] hypxrbeam: i feel like if you want a strong naut in a draft then u got to send it jg with no double support farming naut bc ur not playing for lane giving up lucian nami
[2:25:50] Fissiccisst: wtf does childy and woke mean?
[2:25:51] mrkatsudonnn: fair, its either die in lane or die in team fight ...
[2:26:22] najafan: League is too Woke now, not enough people being put to sleep with Zoe and Lilia.
[2:26:25] wiisoka: @SomeFerretGuy my biggest problem is that every new champs look like either a femboy or a disney princess
[2:26:41] SomeFerretGuy: ksante HUH
[2:26:44] najafan: Too many people awake.

[2:26:49] SomeFerretGuy: smolder HUH
[2:26:52] catast999: hook minion LUL
[2:26:53] IEatLamas: @belminkaric10 I thought the same thing just today, ngl. It's a weird vibe with a mix of random stuff with less of a coherent world imo
[2:27:03] Krethas: @MonteCristo I asked this to DoA too, but when you first started in esports, did your classics background make you feel like you're missing anything, when analyzing game mechanics that are heavily governed by math?
[2:27:11] killerpineapple1: @mrkatsudonnn also i feel as team draft you need another engage to play tahm without something to use to follow up the dive you wont have any clean engage
[2:27:13] belminkaric10: @IEatLamas glad some people get what I mean, old school league was much better
[2:27:15] TehOncomingStorm97: disney princess ksante
[2:27:19] SomeFerretGuy: smolder??

[2:28:11] killerpineapple1: the void is always forgotten about untill its too late
[2:28:16] mjoll_the_hotness: the gentleman cho must be the best skin in the game right
[2:28:18] spucky117: void ivern?
[2:28:22] madiiiman: hes a child
[2:28:24] madiiiman: lol

[2:28:54] Sodo_Mojo: let'
[2:28:56] belminkaric10: @MonteCristo why do you think people arent using ekko more in pro-matches? For me hes a great champion
[2:28:56] lazink: still waiting on a mickey mouse skin
[2:28:59] TehOncomingStorm97: where have the monte skinline ideas gone?
[2:29:04] TheBasedTaka: stat check champ goes wrong, who woulda thought
[2:29:05] belminkaric10: can be top tank with iceborn - sunfire
[2:29:07] Sodo_Mojo: let's make a simple assassin, oh wait we have to nerf her into the ground
[2:29:15] BinglyTinson: bard making biblically accurate angel noises is peak design
[2:29:17] madiiiman: Sadge

[2:29:23] pesukarhupoju: s
[2:29:24] pandagrog: unless she goes into the jungle we will never see her, but riot forces her into midlane for somereason
[2:29:24] Shobes572: Naafiri will be viable after rework
[2:29:25] spucky117: briar is someones bdsm vampire OC/waifu
[2:29:25] TimrewFI: mechanically easy point and click assassin, who couldve thought
[2:29:27] Jaredhtm: Have you watched kt kdf?
[2:29:33] Badseed31: Milio
[2:29:34] killerpineapple1: she has 2 abilities that do the same thing pretty much and that ult oof absolute dog water
[2:29:43] IEatLamas: Is riot HQ in San fransico? The home of 'woke'
[2:29:45] Raydriar: concept is cool, but yeah too bad she sucks
[2:29:47] AzureCatalyst: anyone using the 7tv enorss

[2:31:55] dowiet: the nyquil is getting to him D:
[2:31:55] PickKarma: no shame in being a twink
[2:31:56] Voltiate: kawaii
[2:31:56] madiiiman: @SomeFerretGuy i did not need to see your "smash/pass" list
[2:32:03] najafan: @QuackTheDuck A streamer on here who has a tendency to attract.... questionable people into her community.
[2:32:11] SomeFerretGuy: twink dragon, twink, bdsm, dog, twink, hunk, princess?, not a princess, not a princess, princess? midget
[2:32:14] pandagrog: @mjoll_the_hotness just needs the dyed hair and the piercings
[2:32:16] achillesreel: @PickKarma I feel like there is a little shame
[2:32:17] doggo01610: bro if only peanut lived on even half of his talent on 2017 with faker, they could have won 2017
[2:32:21] alexandrv1992: beryl is Ursula then?
[2:32:29] SomeFerretGuy: @SomeFerretGuy its the release order smadge

[2:32:30] Krethas: Last year we felt quite worried about LCK quality, especially because LPL looked so strong. LPL looks weaker this year, but I dunno if LCK looks that much better.
[2:32:31] arthradot: someone needs to do a study on the correlation between twinkiness and success in league of legends
[2:32:34] Phaetox: Next game will hurt you even more
[2:32:34] belminkaric10: how old is faker?
[2:32:45] Jaredhtm: I think berserker has given up this year. Watching viper on Lucian and berserker on Lucian is a galactic  difference
[2:32:47] Shobes572: Hunks are just the male equivalent of princess
[2:32:48] mjoll_the_hotness: lck this year looks really good with roster shuffles
[2:32:53] najafan: @arthradot Flame has a term named after him.
[2:33:09] QuackTheDuck: Why do pros not FF in pro games or is it not allowed?
[2:33:10] killerpineapple1: but like besides the naut what sort of engage or kiting do they have in an extended or even split teamfight
[2:33:14] SomeFerretGuy: not allowed
[2:33:25] QuackTheDuck: @SomeFerretGuy Why not?
[2:33:26] killerpineapple1: its all situational CC
[2:33:28] belminkaric10: @MonteCristo if you could.. would you and DOA cast LCK again?
[2:33:28] Nymaera_: senna also hates playing against all of these champs
[2:33:30] Jaredhtm: S2 ipl 5 is still the best tournament of all time in terms of fun not quality of game play ofc
[2:33:32] mjoll_the_hotness: damouche
[2:33:33] SomeFerretGuy: why would your org pay you to give up
[2:33:34] pesukarhupoju: Watch was a goated twink too
[2:33:35] profound23: damagey
[2:33:37] SomeFerretGuy: lmao
[2:33:38] BinglyTinson: also why are we trusting kellin with gold over aiming
[2:33:43] Fissiccisst: Monte's mouse penmanship always shocks and amazed me
[2:33:46] profound23: Damage, I heardley knew ye
[2:33:58] madiiiman: monte how do you explain twitch being reworked from pizza foot rat into sewer twink?
[2:34:05] IEatLamas: Someone's gotta build the frozen heart and rookern
[2:34:12] QuackTheDuck: If anything it should be the other way around with allowing pros to FF and ranked games cant FF, because pros should know when games are "over"
[2:34:14] mjoll_the_hotness: just have to pray magical fight and viego resets i guess
[2:34:28] najafan: @madiiiman Hitting the ever important NYC demographic
[2:34:35] PickKarma: that means no
[2:34:35] garry_leonard: Monte i think your right, but only after they got ganked and put behind early. The senna lane if it goes even or gets a kill should shut down the lane
[2:34:41] MustardArrow: Doa Monte Co-Cast rights when?
[2:34:46] Jaredhtm: I think lcs will downsize castors after this split
[2:35:00] Shobes572: No no no
[2:35:06] Nasacrim: Dont think Doa is following league these days
[2:35:09] Clyde1500: @MustardArrow when riot stops hating monte (will happen when hell freezes over)
[2:35:14] Shobes572: Riot will just broadcast the games with no casting
[2:35:22] spucky117: @madiiiman same way they reworked varus from badass defender of his home being corrupted by the void... to hot gay sadboi
[2:35:37] killerpineapple1: its all back end shit with emily
[2:35:38] lazink: the lounge is pointless now
[2:35:46] spucky117: 4
[2:35:49] belminkaric10: is it me or do people watch lcs/na lcs less? I can see like 30-40k people watch the na-lcs before it was alot more @MonteCristo
[2:35:51] najafan: 4
[2:35:52] QuackTheDuck: @Shobes572 Riot should allow you to view the games in client
[2:35:53] PickKarma: jhin
[2:35:54] Jaredhtm: 4 bo1s I. S3 we had 4 castors
[2:35:54] buttp0undr420: Oh god why do they have numbers on their jerseys
[2:35:55] garry_leonard: It's supposed to basically be a psuedo top lane +  adc that should come out of lane even or ahead of the other adc
[2:35:55] SomeFerretGuy: which casters? aren't all but azael and kobe contractors?
[2:35:55] Quanze_: I would prefer if the downsized the analysts and bring back Dash and put the players analyzing the games on the desk
[2:35:55] killerpineapple1: doing like the wack ass intermission shit they need someone to shit on
[2:35:57] madiiiman: @spucky117 Varus, you forgot the double a thing, there was a memo varus... a memo
[2:36:00] Camer0n000: 1 i only count the c9 game
[2:36:04] madiiiman: Varus "two a's? i thought you said 2 gays"
[2:36:07] mjoll_the_hotness: are the oldguard planning to move out of league or why so many new peoble
[2:36:10] IEatLamas: LCS/LEC is so over produced imo
[2:36:11] buttp0undr420: Too many game honestly. Abolish LCS
[2:36:18] awoogawooogawoo: no
[2:36:19] BostromTV: most of them are real good too. rip
[2:36:25] hypxrbeam: Yes lol
[2:36:28] najafan: It's not fun, but yes
[2:36:28] awoogawooogawoo: 1 game and they are tired
[2:36:28] Clyde1500: I've heard rumors
[2:36:31] rogaine_saintvicious2: has to be to be able to fuck em over as 1099s
[2:36:32] roivas1: monkaHmm
[2:36:34] najafan: You've done it
[2:36:35] madiiiman: no
[2:36:36] BinglyTinson: did you see na valorant just announced 18 talent members, like that feels like so many
[2:36:37] madiiiman: its never been done
[2:36:42] madiiiman: in the history of the game
[2:36:42] Jaredhtm: I feel bad for Mark he's in charge of a sinking ship trying his best to save it
[2:36:45] QuackTheDuck: 1 Best of Five a day, keeps the doctor away
[2:36:50] profound23: Stop all this logical thought
[2:36:50] Clyde1500: riot is going to have to invent that. idk when it'll happen
[2:36:52] lazink: don't forget they have to bring in guests casters every week
[2:36:56] madiiiman: because its not one bo5 its 4 bo1 Kappa
[2:37:00] Doorpost877: woah woah woah careful with all that logic monte
[2:37:05] belminkaric10: LCS is dead honestly, 30-40k watches it only LUL @MonteCristo
[2:37:22] spucky117: AND THEY DO THE CARPET SPACE
[2:37:29] pandagrog: lpl casters Aware
[2:37:38] awoogawooogawoo: GIGACHAD LPL CASTER
[2:37:38] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:37:40] awoogawooogawoo: GIGACHAD LPL CASTERS
[2:37:46] madiiiman: Kappa
[2:37:47] madiiiman: 9 games
[2:37:53] catast999: 3 bo3 seems rough
[2:37:56] madiiiman: fucking end me
[2:38:02] madiiiman: if they all go to game 3
[2:38:17] vriesea97: GIGACHAD
[2:38:19] Jaredhtm: Which is why papa came right
[2:38:21] lazink: and don't forget the 4 in the lounge!
[2:38:24] killerpineapple1: its the home region idk what else to say
[2:38:26] SomeFerretGuy: isn't it a way to not pay them as much?
[2:38:32] madiiiman: Papasmithy did every single lck match for an entire split remember
[2:38:39] QuackTheDuck: hehe you said DuDu
[2:38:39] JustBeQuiet: theyrd rather pay contractor rates to 10+ than full time w benefits
[2:38:40] madiiiman: that was 8 bo3 a week
[2:38:40] MrFillz: love all the games atm, started with 2k ESC on esportsbet and now im up to 88.2 usdt, to ther moon
[2:38:41] alexandrv1992: i wonder how LCS casters dont have more kids with so much time on their hands
[2:38:41] BinglyTinson: nah see monte, they need 20 casters so they all know how replaceable they are and keeping them on their toes
[2:38:41] Quanze_: One question: Those the LPL casters do their job with or without being whipped?
[2:38:45] najafan: Well they don't want to fire all of their friends Monte, clearly riot is a family and they love their employees. :)
[2:38:46] Jaredhtm: Doa solo cast was legendary
[2:38:50] snowdayssss: home region that dont win internationals
[2:38:52] Quanze_: Does
[2:38:53] Shobes572: Probably waiting for contracts to expire and won't renew
[2:38:54] madiiiman: papasmithy did 16-24 games a week for an entire split once in lck
[2:38:58] hypxrbeam: i dont think so they normally stretch it the weekend for playoofs
[2:38:58] belminkaric10: @najafan a woke family :)
[2:38:59] killerpineapple1: maybe like in old days
[2:39:01] maximillianss: listen captain flowers could do it all himself for the four game they do have
[2:39:10] mjoll_the_hotness: need to rewatch some telekom wars with monte, doa and papa
[2:39:17] MrFillz: @maximillianss elt him get drunk doing it
[2:39:22] Smylesj: If they only had 2 casters would that risk them becoming too popular
[2:39:22] Clyde1500: @maximillianss I don''t need captain flowers to teach us a word for lonely
[2:39:22] killerpineapple1: i thought that at the start they did 2 BO5 at the start of the pro scene or am i miss thinking
[2:39:27] QuackTheDuck: Why do they only do 1 BO5 a day?
[2:39:28] najafan: @BinglyTinson Actually this is probably part of it. Not so much that they need all they have, but enough that they're not gonna just go to 2.
[2:39:31] madiiiman: monte Papasmithy proved you can do 16-24 (depending on bo3 length) games in lck per week for 4 months
[2:39:46] spucky117: monte doa and papa casts were awesome
[2:39:49] Rysikoss: was it healthy though
[2:39:53] belminkaric10: LCS is dead, no one even watches it relly
[2:39:53] madiiiman: 10? what was the old ogn scheddule?
[2:39:54] is__nova: @spucky117 i so miss that
[2:39:55] belminkaric10: really'
[2:40:00] Jaredhtm: It's probably a good faith thing where no one wants to let go anymore people on broadcast
[2:40:06] awoogawooogawoo: GIGACHAD
[2:40:08] maximillianss: masters was fun though
[2:40:08] MrFillz: @Rysikoss probably more healthy than working with riot these days
[2:40:12] QuackTheDuck: coached CLG lmao
[2:40:14] madiiiman: ohhh masters
[2:40:15] spucky117: only slightly less cool were Atlus Papa LS casts
[2:40:17] burdil3z: do a surprise bangers only with do a pls
[2:40:19] madiiiman: forgot masters
[2:40:19] mjoll_the_hotness: all worked out. hes still kind sane Kappa
[2:40:25] mjoll_the_hotness: kinda*
[2:40:27] thelasts1lence: Personally I think they need 3 at best. Just swap them every day and it should be fine. Azael, Kobe and CptFlowers are literally goats of NA castings and them 3 would be enough. But unfortunately that would mean them having too much saying which Riot hates
[2:40:28] QuackTheDuck: I remember the spinning the wheel days
[2:40:28] generalgreens: what was harder coaching CLG or casting 30 games a week
[2:40:33] awoogawooogawoo: how many are lcs caster?
[2:40:34] najafan: Well, hypothetically, if they do the CBLOL/LCS dual conference thing, they might need more casters then.
[2:40:36] QuackTheDuck: Spin the CLG wheel
[2:40:41] cmaaaaas: does it cost LCS more though?
[2:40:48] Trunks1195: EZ
[2:41:00] madiiiman: just strap captainflowers to a chair and tape a microphone to his chin
[2:41:02] spucky117: thats why Captain flowers is so hype for such shit games...
[2:41:03] Badseed31: So who do you fire? And is it worth the backlash you will probably get for it now a days?
[2:41:06] belminkaric10: riot games, dead company :)
[2:41:17] MrFillz: @madiiiman and a bottle of whiskey
[2:41:17] JakeJr: it's because the LCS casters are soft as fuck and can't hang
[2:41:28] killerpineapple1: you also get Tax breaks for having X employees
[2:41:30] SomeFerretGuy: @Badseed31 you fire the academy casters you called up
[2:41:32] butelka_z_odzysku: so which 2 casters would you pick?
[2:41:39] Krethas: @Badseed31 What backlash? They literally let go of the desk host of the year and I don't really see any
[2:41:45] bull3271: when does rito decision make sense lol
[2:41:48] killerpineapple1: prob just meeting some bullshit Company tax break honestly
[2:41:48] QuackTheDuck: maybe they want the audience to hear a difference voice across the games
[2:41:52] spucky117: and 85 analysts
[2:41:58] mjoll_the_hotness: wait where is dash
[2:41:58] Jaredhtm: @montecristo remember lcs super weeks in s3 of 8 games a day
[2:42:06] AzureCatalyst: I'd wager that they don't want a Caedrel/Sjokz situation where the want zero chance for them to withold their labor
[2:42:08] mjoll_the_hotness: i really havent followed lcs
[2:42:09] najafan: @Krethas I'll have backlash if they let Emily go :(
[2:42:10] maximillianss: i think it is why na is weak even tho the pros could practice more technically
[2:42:12] Trunks1195: NA LUL KR PogChamp
[2:42:14] triggerzugz: why are they stuck on bo1?
[2:42:17] Badseed31: @krethas there was backlash for that for a little while.
[2:42:17] madiiiman: Monte be very careful, lest they fire everyone and bring in frosk for a solo cast each superweek
[2:42:38] AzureCatalyst: Flowers and Azael perma on every game. Probably rotate Kobe in if one of them wants a break

[2:42:41] belminkaric10: @hertzyu trust me, I see the trend, I was a hardcore league fan before now I barely know any names or teams in LCS, no one watches it. Woke casters, and boring gameplay.
[2:42:43] MrFillz: does the new girl on the desk have any esports exp?
[2:42:48] weak_mental_renekton: Casting analysis has gone way down hill
[2:42:53] Krethas: @Badseed31 Yeah and then they let Quickshot go too. It's hard to imagine them being too bothered
[2:42:55] awoogawooogawoo: go watch monte Kappa
[2:42:59] the_stuu: who would you keep on LCS?
[2:42:59] MrFillz: she seems like she has minimal exp
[2:42:59] QuackTheDuck: If they give Captain Flowers, co streaming, nobody watch the LCS lmao
[2:43:00] butelka_z_odzysku: who should be fired if theres only 2 spots?
[2:43:01] fernysilva19: So like how they run lpl English
[2:43:04] killerpineapple1: @MrFillz she barley plays LOL it was a casual enjoyment
[2:43:06] Quanze_: Dumb Question: How does any league have a profit with costreamers? Baiano today had 50 k viewers while CBLOL was at 5k viewers
[2:43:06] maximillianss: If every league in the world was paying BO3's or BO5's every week we would have a different league
[2:43:06] docallens: love the meteos streams
[2:43:10] IEatLamas: How often do LCS casters just say things that are wrong, too
[2:43:13] JakeJr: isn't that why they're doing the co-stream thing? to cut overhead
[2:43:18] 汚い抱き枕: Will we ever get NO voices? Like an option where we can just watch the games with game sounds and without casters?
[2:43:19] pandagrog: we still dont know why quickshot was let go and it seems like nobody really cared
[2:43:20] Trunks1195: @butelka_z_odzysku everyone and then hire doa + monte
[2:43:21] notbaltej: stort the vods stop talkin bout garbage region
[2:43:28] awoogawooogawoo: meteos, sneaky and doublelift co stream are funny af
[2:43:38] Zoogs: @MonteCristo What is important change Riot needs to make to be more successful for the future?
[2:43:41] rogaine_saintvicious2: i only want flowers + kobe anyways
[2:43:51] madiiiman: @Zoogs decide if they are an esport or a marketing exercise
[2:43:53] buttp0undr420: LCS gets the same viewership as big Melee tournaments LUL
[2:43:54] madiiiman: they have no idea
[2:43:56] madiiiman: which they want to be
[2:43:57] belminkaric10: LCK i can watch and enjoy, never like the LPL cause of china(communism) @hertzyu
[2:44:01] rogaine_saintvicious2: any other pairing is a downgrade
[2:44:03] Jaredhtm: There is a clean stream but it's only available to co streamers in lpp
[2:44:05] maximillianss: remember kids watch fifa and drink a coke a cola
[2:44:17] SirHoundSound: I was so mad when they changed lcs last year, I basically stopped caring. I still don't care, but will occasionally watch it again since it's back on the weekend at a reasonable time
[2:44:26] Warchawk: Wait Riot can or can't use viewer numbers from co-streams for sponsors?
[2:44:26] awoogawooogawoo: @rogaine_saintvicious2 same
[2:44:26] SomeFerretGuy: @rogaine_saintvicious2 gimme 1 game a day tricast with jatt too thanks
[2:44:29] madiiiman: @hertzyu if phreak on the balance team causes the shit we saw in the flyquest c9 game today, he can stay
[2:44:30] Jaredhtm: Back in the day we saint drunk casting tournaments
[2:44:36] buttp0undr420: Not even the biggest Melee tournaments, just *big* Melee tournaments
[2:44:36] AzureCatalyst: ViperDespair
[2:44:39] MrFillz: @MrFillz it shows
[2:44:43] killerpineapple1: @rogaine_saintvicious2 FOR REAL every champ he said he has liked fundamentally is strong and the rest are trashed
[2:44:56] AzureCatalyst: NOOO
[2:44:59] madiiiman: WutFace
[2:45:00] madiiiman: ZEKA CORKI
[2:45:01] TheBasedTaka: Yeah the fact that lcs has less viewership than grassroots fg tournaments despite having embeds is kinda sad
[2:45:01] killerpineapple1: i like how they buff EZ then nerf him past where he was buffed from its crazy
[2:45:02] madiiiman: HIDE YOUR KIDS
[2:45:02] AzureCatalyst: ViperDespair Zeka Corki
[2:45:04] DavP3rz: Lucian Viper almost the same as Aiming
[2:45:05] mjoll_the_hotness: corkis plane already on fire
[2:45:05] Quanze_: So can they use the costreamers numbers of viewership to sell marketing spots on the cast?
[2:45:07] Helmzee: It's likely due to public perception too. Even though the total games are the same, 4 sets of teams likely would feel longer with the same cast than 2 sets of teams. Frankly LCS needs to just adopt bo3 or bo2.
[2:45:07] AzureCatalyst: Please god why ViperDespair
[2:45:10] belminkaric10: riot games went downhill when they started to bring in people based on their sexual-preference, race and gender, lcs is an great example SeemsGood
[2:45:29] rogaine_saintvicious2: @Helmzee i didnt even know there was a super week this week lol
[2:45:31] madiiiman: @hertzyu void grubs invaded top lane and started hitting t1 turret
[2:45:31] awoogawooogawoo: OOOO
[2:45:33] madiiiman: im not kidding
[2:45:37] rogaine_saintvicious2: and then  they shift the schedule an hour
[2:45:38] AzureCatalyst: AAAA
[2:45:40] SomeFerretGuy: that shit was hilarious
[2:45:41] Jaredhtm: Lcs went down hill when they switched from bo3 to bo1s again
[2:45:43] burdil3z: always 2-0 we need a 2-1 NewRecord
[2:45:46] Helmzee: @rogaine_saintvicious2 SAme
[2:45:55] AzureCatalyst: ngl these dom emotes make my day
[2:45:57] Badseed31: Fire all the casters and let ai chat cast as Joe rogan
[2:46:06] rogaine_saintvicious2: consistency is key to fucking anything in life, especially viewership.
[2:46:09] Fissiccisst: @belminkaric10 you are the most blatant right wing cool aid drinking parrot I've seen in quite a while LUL
[2:46:11] pandagrog: @AzureCatalyst WHATAREWESAYING
[2:46:11] madiiiman: have dash and dark dash be cocasters
[2:46:25] lazink: @rogaine_saintvicious2 to be fair, the hour shift was a smart move
[2:46:25] Jaredhtm: Also lcs doesn't have any personalities anymore
[2:46:33] AzureCatalyst: Ah there isn't an AnkaraMessi angle
[2:46:33] killerpineapple1: oh yeah
[2:46:33] mjoll_the_hotness: AI casting with joe biden trump and mickey mpouse
[2:46:34] SomeFerretGuy: @Fissiccisst true
[2:46:38] rogaine_saintvicious2: @lazink in between breaks sure
[2:46:42] madiiiman: are they scared the sylas comes out vs maokai?
[2:46:50] rogaine_saintvicious2: and no it wasnt a smart move
[2:46:51] killerpineapple1: prob just didnt want to get renta ulted or better moa ult
[2:46:52] belminkaric10: @Fissiccisst mate just the truth, They hire people based of "DEI" and not competence, I know very well.
[2:47:03] killerpineapple1: out drafted themselves
[2:47:05] belminkaric10: @Fissiccisst look it up.
[2:47:07] rogaine_saintvicious2: had wayyyy more people come over from LEC than RN to lcs
[2:47:22] Quanze_: What champ do you think is the best blind pick on Top right now? Udyr?
[2:47:26] lazink: @rogaine_saintvicious2 naa, they saw the numbers, people were watching LEC over them, and see the bump when LEC ends, why keep fighting that?
[2:47:28] rogaine_saintvicious2: anywyas listening to monte from now
[2:47:30] Fissiccisst: @belminkaric10 conspiracy theory searches only result in the fake information they're born from
[2:47:31] SomeFerretGuy: welcome to every org operating in the united states
[2:47:34] killerpineapple1: oh yeah i dont disagree there just trying to thing from a coach perspective
[2:47:37] SomeFerretGuy: lmao
[2:47:38] rogaine_saintvicious2: @lazink wat 30k
[2:47:39] Jaredhtm: Think of it this way they had to move lcs later to get the lec host cause of how bad viewership was

[2:47:50] killerpineapple1: every ult is good
[2:47:54] killerpineapple1: and has a use
[2:48:00] killerpineapple1: theres no useless ult for him
[2:48:00] hypxrbeam: udyr prio is down im surprised
[2:48:03] SomeFerretGuy: no @rogaine_saintvicious2 we're busy arguing with a right wing nutjob
[2:48:04] rogaine_saintvicious2: they saw the numbers, interpreted them like 1st year undergrads and made a huge shift
[2:48:06] Phaetox: Sylas supp is good af
[2:48:08] lazink: @rogaine_saintvicious2 was friday at 1pm-4pm, people at work
[2:48:11] madiiiman: you being tired will make the fly c9 game even more fun
[2:48:13] belminkaric10: @Fissiccisst ohh so "dei" aka diversity, equity and inclusion is a conspiracy theory.. haha you're so clueless :D
[2:48:26] awoogawooogawoo: has zeka played akali yet?
[2:48:31] AzureCatalyst: What is it's a way to train Zeka on Corki before the playoffs monkaHmm
[2:48:35] butelka_z_odzysku: who's the best single player in both these teams? @MonteCristo
[2:48:35] treefallin: Man, I miss MonteCristo's LCK days BibleThump
[2:48:36] Shobes572: For the redemption arc
[2:48:44] AzureCatalyst: peepoYell
[2:48:48] SomeFerretGuy: @AzureCatalyst did that work for doublelift's vlad? rofl
[2:48:49] rogaine_saintvicious2: @SomeFerretGuy colorado springer?
[2:48:50] madiiiman: honestly the biggest tragedy of this game is that Zeka has a win on corki...
[2:49:08] Nasacrim: He played akali and wasnt a liability
[2:49:10] Camer0n000: who would you take between boston celtics shaq and 2024 showmaker
[2:49:14] madiiiman: Kappa monte we both know the answer is Kingen
[2:49:17] madiiiman: hes a world champion
[2:49:22] madiiiman: and clapped zaues
[2:49:24] madiiiman: zeus*
[2:49:34] killerpineapple1: I also like how riot passes the malgince as a bug not an intention when they put in how eclipse works
[2:49:36] mjoll_the_hotness: dont remind us that drx won world. iam gonna puke
[2:49:50] killerpineapple1: they could have easily put it to attack or ability triggers it instead of dmg
[2:49:58] madiiiman: @mjoll_the_hotness Pyosik has more world championships than Peanut and Score combined
[2:49:58] najafan: @belminkaric10 Hey, someone with a strong background in academia here. DEI is a joke, nobody really cares about it. It's not some sinister conspiracy out to promote people past what they actually deserve, it's largely a checklist people fill out and never think about again. Nobody cares about it except for right wing grifters.
[2:50:14] kshyle: oh yes the zeka corki part 2 LuL
[2:50:16] awoogawooogawoo: peepoTrip
[2:50:16] SomeFerretGuy: peepoTrip
[2:50:21] mjoll_the_hotness: you evil person @madiiiman PoroSad
[2:50:23] Zoraion: hi monte
[2:50:35] IEatLamas: @belminkaric10 What does academia have to do with it? honest question
[2:50:38] awoogawooogawoo: peepoAds
[2:50:40] grandezelx: Faker has the best laning stats in the league tho you will see sm doesnt smash this matchup as hard
[2:50:41] AzureCatalyst: peepoAds
[2:50:43] SomeFerretGuy: peepoAds
[2:50:48] madiiiman: @mjoll_the_hotness Look I don't make the rules, 1 >0 so Pyosik > Score all time
[2:50:57] madiiiman: actually i better stop before monte takes my sword away
[2:51:00] madiiiman: Keepo
[2:51:12] Fissiccisst: cristoPLEB  peepoAds  cristoPLEB
[2:51:18] belminkaric10: @najafan I think you're wrong, big companies hire people based of that. Mark Cuban is defending it so elon musk told him to have a NBA teal full of short women from china
[2:51:20] killerpineapple1: i also dont really like the renata force from HLE like DKs team don't really care if they get ulted by her
[2:51:29] catast999: if only he won his jax gamme vs blg
[2:51:29] najafan: @IEatLamas It's literally a term that originates in academia. Somewhat related to affirmative action in hiring / admissions.
[2:51:36] AzureCatalyst: RIOT
[2:51:44] tranquil54: @MonteCristo league golden age was when you and doa casted lck miss those days
[2:52:08] butelka_z_odzysku: which player is a weak point in these teams? @MonteCristo
[2:52:11] belminkaric10: alright back to league, which 3 champs are OP according to you? @MonteCristo
[2:52:24] madiiiman: @tranquil54 look up Fenjih on youtube. entire channel is old ogn and early lck day casting highlights including the old podcasts during pauses
[2:52:25] Jaredhtm: The spo tv split was rough for lck for a while
[2:52:26] IEatLamas: @IEatLamas Ofc that's where it originated.. but idk if that makes it as insignificant for companies
[2:52:31] grandezelx: @MonteCristo are we seeing the old faker now he has the highest xpd and csd in mid he is literally chovying
[2:52:36] Phaetox: Cuban and Musk are both morons
[2:52:39] kradoucksticks: have dk had a tough schedule? i don’t rly see them as a bottom lck team

[2:52:49] najafan: @belminkaric10 If ALL ELSE IS EQUAL, yes, it matters. But nobody is going to get promoted past where they deserve. Hiring managers literally laugh at it.
[2:53:02] notbaltej: s3 faker > other fakers
[2:53:04] SomeFerretGuy: @MonteCristo can we kill this stupid conversation and force chat back to talking about league
[2:53:19] Jaredhtm: He might still be a 3 trick
[2:53:19] mjoll_the_hotness: is faker getting close the esports goat or are the starcraft peoble on another level
[2:53:22] awoogawooogawoo: ikwym
[2:53:22] najafan: @SomeFerretGuy Please.
[2:53:34] Fissiccisst: @SomeFerretGuy I just planned on not responding anymore lol
[2:53:35] killerpineapple1: i feel almost as if you ban him our more it may work out better get him on something hes not completely comfy with
[2:53:40] gerbilsdontexist: Faker always has the jungler doing all the little things around his lane
[2:53:53] madiiiman: Alternatively Monte... they just removed the surgical ikplant on his wrist that was installed after season 7 to slowly cripple his mechanics in lane. now that its gone, hes reverting back to jesus in a gamer chair form
[2:53:55] gerbilsdontexist: makes his lane phase as fluid is possible
[2:53:59] IWillDumbinate: Talking about Faker when hes not even in this game LUL
[2:54:01] killerpineapple1: ori is by far his most played champ solo q
[2:54:34] awoogawooogawoo: will the meta gonna stay in mage mid?
[2:54:34] catanenjoyer: @killerpineapple1 its jut not lol
[2:54:39] gerbilsdontexist: Faker is not better than Chovy, SM or BDD
[2:54:40] belminkaric10: @najafan look up "united airlines" from the USA, and what they are doing right now by hiring according to "DEI"...
[2:54:42] AzureCatalyst: @madiiiman Faker becoming one of the Spice Lords from Dune and just being a brain sitting on a chair would be the truly fantastical ending we deserve
[2:54:43] IEatLamas: I always think about how different things would be in T1 if anyone switched teams or if Faker quit, how things would change for them
[2:54:43] waynevanilla: Would you still say the same thing if faker lost worlds last year
[2:54:44] killerpineapple1: yeah hes not the only good player anymore he can facilitate his team instead of just solo carry
[2:54:55] jerckysminion: i missed most of the banger tonight no?
[2:55:01] Jaredhtm: I'm still surprised lcs might still have 4 teams at worlds this year
[2:55:03] SomeFerretGuy: @jerckysminion half
[2:55:05] Badseed31: If it ain't broke don't fix it
[2:55:06] IEatLamas: All other teams switch players frequently but T1 hasn't for so long
[2:55:11] kraethan: Also hes probably doing a loylt of the shotcalling, so only having one playstyle is nice for that
[2:55:17] najafan: lmao
[2:55:22] mjoll_the_hotness: zeka was possessed that year
[2:55:22] AzureCatalyst: Spice Guild aka Navigators. I dunno why I called them Spice lords
[2:55:23] weak_mental_renekton: faker on annie was funny
[2:55:36] Jaredhtm: Zeka intensifies
[2:55:40] butelka_z_odzysku: @MonteCristo who should be swapped in T1 to make them stronger?
[2:55:44] killerpineapple1: his CS/min is crazy
[2:55:46] trueaether: To be fair, Faker looked pretty bad individually at worlds despite winning
[2:55:56] killerpineapple1: always has 10+csm
[2:55:56] tranquil54: @MonteCristo any new up and coming players an lck to keep an eye on
[2:55:59] najafan: True, Faker is just out knowledging people after playing for 10 years.
[2:56:02] madiiiman: faker beat zekas ass so hard they took away zekas trophy and food for thought, is the faker azir shuffle on ruler now meaning faker has the top 3 plays in league history...? the 1v1 vs ryu, the scoop on ruler, and ave faker an honorary 5th worlds title
[2:56:03] IEatLamas: I really think T1's biggest strenght is their coordination and teamplay
[2:56:12] AzureCatalyst: Lucid looks fantastic
[2:56:12] buttp0undr420: Zeka got smashed like the orphans locked in Slasher's basement
[2:56:16] kraethan: I mean he was also still recovering from injury at worlds
[2:56:22] snowdayssss: any reason why carry junglers are so good in soloq and not on comp?
[2:56:23] jerckysminion: lucid has had some massive misses though
[2:56:24] madiiiman: why did it paste 2 messaes
[2:56:24] Jaredhtm: Perfect has been iffy
[2:56:26] grandezelx: @trueaether this is stright cap by the way he had the best stats out of all the mid at worlds
[2:56:28] Phaetox: Faker does this every now and then. Picks a few champs and basically says how long will it take yall to force me onto something new. Why fix what isn't broken
[2:56:30] AzureCatalyst: I was impressed by Bull. I had heard he was unimpressive in Challengers but he's been really solid
[2:56:39] madiiiman: food for thought, is the faker azir shuffle on ruler now meaning faker has the top 3 plays in league history...? the 1v1 vs ryu, the scoop on ruler, and idk, the entire process of winninfood for thought, is the faker azir shuffle on ruler now meaning faker has the top 3 plays in league history...? the 1v1 vs ryu, the scoop on ruler, and  worlds with blank?
[2:56:44] jerckysminion: yeah his rell & sej games are good
[2:56:48] madiiiman: ok
[2:56:50] madiiiman: my keybaord is broken
[2:56:51] AzureCatalyst: The Rell game where showmaker played Sylas was a masterclass in tank play and backing up your fed melee carry @MonteCristo
[2:56:51] mjoll_the_hotness: hes gonna be great like you have showmaker as your mid
[2:56:52] madiiiman: ill be back
[2:56:53] notbaltej: did you see pyosik make sponge cry?
[2:56:54] ScrandyCornetto: perfect Despairge
[2:56:57] killerpineapple1: @Phaetox master as reading the meta and plays what his team needs
[2:57:00] butelka_z_odzysku: which role is the hardest for rookies?
[2:57:17] madiiiman: hello chat. are my messages doubling anymore?
[2:57:19] madiiiman: testing
[2:57:20] AzureCatalyst: Nope
[2:57:21] madiiiman: ok wr are good
[2:57:22] AzureCatalyst: You're good
[2:57:24] Quhery330: i would also cry if i lost against pyosik
[2:57:26] Fissiccisst: nope, you're good mad
[2:57:28] madiiiman: that was annoying

[2:57:48] kraethan: @butelka_z_odzysku probably mid
[2:57:49] najafan: @madiiiman He surely has a lot of the top. But does he have the top 3? I dunno.

[2:58:35] jerckysminion: break their arms:
[2:58:37] GodlyAlba: cops xdd
[2:58:37] PickKarma: should rename it to "stop resisting arrest"
[2:58:39] Jaredhtm: They did it with twitch too
[2:58:39] hynterman: GEORGE FLOYD'D
[2:58:40] Pamperchu: should just call it "stop resisting"
[2:58:43] Fissiccisst: literally the "Stop Resisting!" as you beat someone to death
[2:58:44] AzureCatalyst: STOP RESISTING

[2:59:00] madiiiman: Stop Resisting shud be her q
[2:59:05] weak_mental_renekton: vi should not be allowed to ult ekko
[2:59:07] najafan: Vi literally stands for Violence.
[2:59:15] SomeFerretGuy: what about ksante
[2:59:17] AzureCatalyst: classic RIOT nonsense
[2:59:19] jerckysminion: typical riot when u think it can't get worse they find a way
[2:59:19] Trunks1195: Nah. They need to have her say "STOP RESISTING" during her ult animation
[2:59:21] HexSensie: Change her Q to Qualified Immunity
[2:59:22] killerpineapple1: welcome to the slamm
[2:59:24] najafan: Her entire thing is that she's a violent cop.
[2:59:24] IEatLamas: @najafan LuL

[3:00:47] jerckysminion: should just give her a big thick book where she smacks u with like the old cops used to do
[3:00:51] madiiiman: the best one is "Why can't I get a straight answer? It's always just 'Oh no! Stop hitting me! Ow, my face!'
[3:00:56] JakeJr: A game just can't be a game. It has to be a political position.
[3:00:58] AzureCatalyst: WOOOO BARRELS

[3:05:27] Shobes572: Cheer100 Monte, the whole point of facechecking is checking the brush with your face
[3:05:27] AzureCatalyst: Zeka sacrificed everything for that one worlds Run he's doomed to be a potato for the rest of his days

[3:08:06] Arford: Monte, is there a particular translation of Parzival that you recommend? Or rather, which version(s) did you use for your thesis?
[3:08:07] myosotismenot: WICKED time to play
[3:08:08] SomeFerretGuy: cristoPLEB
[3:08:12] Professional_Aellith: Doesn’t baby Cristo know that Poppa Monte is busy malding over Korean teenagers?

[3:09:33] Badseed31: Doran did push that gnar back to viper

[3:09:42] mjoll_the_hotness: the word washed actually banned in lec chat. peoble did some dank memes with it since i see deleted messages

[3:11:38] killerpineapple1: WHY DOES ZEKA EVERY GAME BUILD MAW
[3:11:39] Aoyos_: @killerpineapple1 Nope, he TP's when DK is already on the retreat. The moment Delight used Renata ult was the time to TP, anything after is a waste and you're better off staying in lane

[3:15:36] fljqpy: BIG L
[3:15:37] Krethas: The LCK casters said there's a noticeable difference between west and east side teams. Watching DK and HLE, I wonder if they still have that confidence

[3:20:11] belminkaric10: why aren't there any female teams or any girls in LCK lcs etc? I think they could do a good job at support
[3:20:14] madiiiman: monte would you believe if i told you that was zeka's best use of package this game btw?
[3:20:15] archie7497: Wait why the fuck does aiming have as boots on lethality varus??m
[3:20:31] madiiiman: @archie7497 in case hail of blades isnt enough
[3:20:52] archie7497: @madiiiman but his autos do piss damage.
[3:20:55] Phaetox: To AA spam during arrow chain cc
[3:21:10] archie7497: Also his passive literally gives AS
[3:21:21] Phaetox: More AS means faster blight stacking
[3:21:32] mjoll_the_hotness: 2017 pray varus at worlds pew pew pew
[3:22:13] Aoyos_: @archie7497 It's not about the autos, it's about passive stacking to pop for burst
[3:22:14] najafan: AS boots is fine if you think you hit your haste breakpoints.
[3:22:17] madiiiman: narrator "zeka did not redeem himself"
[3:22:37] catast999: kingen and zeka best frieds and inters
[3:22:49] Aoyos_: But monte, if Zeka wastes the package there that means he can't suicide with it
[3:22:59] Aoyos_: So it's a good package
[3:23:02] kraethan: Better than the last fuckin package
[3:23:17] mjoll_the_hotness: viper flashing forward hes really trying

[3:23:19] fljqpy: u know that viper gonna go ham
[3:23:39] fatalqwerty: GEN vs KDF reminds me of Zack Snyder's Batman versus Superman, where Batman tells superman: "Do you bleed? You will..." and then KDF just shows the world they can make GEN bleed but they still lose in a straight up battle
[3:23:55] Phaetox: That was a good instinct
[3:24:02] QuietLighter: ya i would call trat a good Lucid play rather than a bad viper play
[3:24:05] Aoyos_: Lucid already had Q charged to escape but he found the opening and instantly pulled trigger
[3:24:07] Zebrios: Lucid is already clutch.
[3:24:11] gerbilsdontexist: Lucid getting the Canyon experience!
[3:24:14] archie7497: @aoyos_ just get ionion and hit more q's. It's safer as well since you can play from out of Jax mao and Renata range
[3:24:18] gerbilsdontexist: BANISH KELLIN!
[3:24:20] mjoll_the_hotness: viper is losing it with this team
[3:24:34] Aoyos_: @archie7497 I don't disagree just saying the point of AS boots
[3:24:48] Zebrios: @MonteCristo I predict that within 3 years, Lucid has an LCK title and at least semifinals worlds.
[3:25:03] fljqpy: how about this year tho peepoSad
[3:25:06] frieza558: hey monte can i ask a LFN culture question?
[3:25:14] fljqpy: can D- win this year peepoSad
[3:25:42] frieza558: will you guys ever do a Fast and Furious segment on four play?
[3:25:59] Smylesj: what version kindle do you guys use?
[3:26:19] Fissiccisst: but what about FEMLY monte?
[3:26:29] SomeFerretGuy: I wonder which would be less painful; being a TL fan or bein a c9 hate watcher Thinkge . Being a TL fan ain't working out these days
[3:26:30] fIuffee: who comes out on top in a free for all cage match between the 3 horsemen?
[3:26:34] Fissiccisst: gotta do Tokyo Drift LUL
[3:26:37] PickKarma: what about 10 in a row
[3:26:39] DankWizard420: tokyo drift Pog
[3:26:53] najafan: @archie7497 If you already have a lot of haste and not a lot of AS, it might be better to have AS boots might be better. (For instance, if you have max haste from other items, but can't do 3 autos between the spells, but boots gives you just enough AS to get to that breakpoint.)
[3:26:54] Arcane_Cat: favorite stephen king book?
[3:26:58] najafan: It's contextual.
[3:27:01] Manjiji: The main actor is tokyo drift is so annoying
[3:27:08] ChristmasTime_LoR: Have yall reviewed "The Lobster"? @MonteCristo
[3:27:10] aBitTooHircine: Im so hyped for the heist series
[3:27:26] generalgreens: @Manjiji its a fantastic movie outside of the acting lol
[3:27:28] gerbilsdontexist: Jhin Zhao
[3:27:30] Aoyos_: @SomeFerretGuy At least a C9 hater knows there'll always be payout at worlds
[3:27:31] Zebrios: tokyo drift was the last good one.
[3:27:34] mjoll_the_hotness: iam so bad at finding new things to watch
[3:27:36] SomeFerretGuy: speaking of heist, I did finish Heat after all and everything I said about it was wrong, it was great.
[3:27:40] DankWizard420: @Manjiji dont like my boy derrick? (all I know is he's in ncis los angeles) kekw
[3:27:53] pandagrog: Yorgos Lanthimos
[3:27:54] StuntmanStan: but do you rock lobster
[3:27:58] najafan: "It might be better to have AS boots might be better" I'm very eloquent.
[3:28:01] Arford: So you did a reading of MonteCristo on your side channels; will you do readings of anything else?
[3:28:05] dbird901: yorgos lanthmos
[3:28:14] ChristmasTime_LoR: I keep telling people to watch it but they just laugh and think im messing wit hthem
[3:28:15] Keesofer: what is your favorite lck team
[3:28:17] dbird901: Poor Things is amazing
[3:28:17] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:28:38] QuietLighter: OMG  T1 HATER OMG OMG OMG     /s
[3:28:41] gerbilsdontexist: Monte what is your favorite LCK team of all time?
[3:28:42] fljqpy: geng or old geng
[3:28:46] Arcane_Cat: chovy enjoyers GIGACHAD
[3:28:47] alexandrv1992: how about some cyberpunk movies? like blade runner or matrix movie maybe?
[3:28:47] e6merald6: who can beat gen g
[3:28:49] fljqpy: (hle)
[3:28:52] mjoll_the_hotness: why does monte hate t1 so much PoroSad
[3:28:53] SomeFerretGuy: @Arford alsoa holiday special of Poe iirc
[3:28:56] Fissiccisst: y'all are too cultured for me, I enjoy my trash movies too much LUL
[3:29:01] twayzz1: i just want to watch the zone of interest
[3:29:02] Fissiccisst: RaccAttack Clap
[3:29:06] MustardArrow: isn't og KT the PVE team?
[3:29:08] CrazyPoorer: any reason why t1 isn't your favorite lck team?
[3:29:19] fljqpy: reason?
[3:29:19] Nasacrim: sadly, i think Kiin is a fraud in the making
[3:29:21] e6merald6: is Kingen actually an Aatrox one trick?
[3:29:25] Halkmonzod: NS vs HLE who is winning?
[3:29:33] Snowbear22: how would consider the torn sequel?
[3:29:38] najafan: Do Columbo.
[3:29:39] Fissiccisst: The only thing I remember about Sin City is that Frodo Baggins is in it
[3:29:41] najafan: :)
[3:29:46] Fissiccisst: (elijah Wood)
[3:29:47] archie7497: @najafan I get that but the varus does/can not auto vs the frontline of jax mao Renata. AS boots can be good situationally but it's not good in this game imo
[3:29:48] SomeFerretGuy: zeka???
[3:29:49] fljqpy: NOOOOO
[3:29:52] mjoll_the_hotness: THE GOAT
[3:29:58] nighkey: bruh
[3:29:59] madiiiman: ZEKA CORKI
[3:29:59] catast999: zeka clearly too skilled
[3:30:00] Aoyos_: Lucid didn't even smite
[3:30:00] rilsolo: dang i called it he wins it for them
[3:30:01] madiiiman: FOR THE WIN
[3:30:02] Nasacrim: zeka's corki is just insane
[3:30:03] mjoll_the_hotness: world champion hands baybeee
[3:30:04] QuietLighter: Peanut smite timing was good
[3:30:05] Zebrios: Man sin city was so good.
[3:30:08] Amosdragon: Zeka not washed afterall!
[3:30:11] Fissiccisst: Does that count as a Baron throw?
[3:30:11] nighkey: how
[3:30:11] SomeFerretGuy: zeka cosplaying fenix
[3:30:14] madiiiman: monte... apologize to zeka now
[3:30:14] Aoyos_: Zeka's clearly the best corki ever
[3:30:16] hibbjibb: Howdy bang gang
[3:30:16] najafan: @archie7497 Pros tend to stick on one build and not deviate from it, can't deny that.
[3:30:16] madiiiman: right now
[3:30:37] madiiiman: you owe zeka corki an apology
[3:30:45] e6merald6: now HLE will think that Zeka's corki is good
[3:30:53] aBitTooHircine: NAILS NAILS
[3:30:54] mjoll_the_hotness: we all own zeka a private jet now
[3:30:55] canyon_55: ZEKA CORKI FOR THE WIN EZ
[3:31:01] QuietLighter: peanut hits those smite
[3:31:08] ChristmasTime_LoR: it dies from over 1300
[3:31:14] archie7497: @najafan but the standard lethality varus build is with ionian
[3:31:23] Loroco: picked up the baron like he was taking his package
[3:31:26] SomeFerretGuy: is peanut the greatest smiter in history
[3:31:29] canyon_55: its not lucid fault tbh
[3:31:32] fljqpy: DK let them in wtf
[3:31:42] gerbilsdontexist: Send Kellin to Challengers!
[3:31:45] gerbilsdontexist: NO SEND KELLIN HOME
[3:31:48] najafan: @archie7497 But is Aiming's? I dunno. Pros can be weird.
[3:31:50] gerbilsdontexist: KELLIN AINT IT
[3:31:50] madiiiman: @SomeFerretGuy no cuz sometimes he leeves the pit Kappa
[3:32:06] fljqpy: just let peanut walk in LUL
[3:32:08] gerbilsdontexist: HE WOULD MISS
[3:32:16] Zelgius: Lucid should be the one calling it off, he's the jungler
[3:32:18] Aoyos_: You needed to save either Varus ult or Ashe arrow for it
[3:32:31] Aoyos_: Instead they use both to go fishing
[3:32:52] mjoll_the_hotness: i bet peanut piloted that steal
[3:32:54] fljqpy: they jjust dispersed away from the baron and let HLE walks in
[3:32:55] QuietLighter: so... 2023 DK?   Lose at Baron???
[3:33:04] canyon_55: waste ashe arrow and immediately start baron  nice strat
[3:33:08] mjoll_the_hotness: or peanut mind controlled zeka
[3:33:12] QuietLighter: Cloudtemplar's advice to 2023 DK was to never do Baron lol
[3:33:14] ChristmasTime_LoR: iim really not a fan of kellin and kingen
[3:33:23] mjoll_the_hotness: zeka was pretty much peanuts other smite

[3:33:25] Aoyos_: It's just what happens when you're playing against the best corki in LCK
[3:33:52] CrazyPoorer: any reason why t1 isn't your favorite lck team?
[3:33:54] canyon_55: no dmg lmao
[3:34:29] fljqpy: any reason LUL
[3:34:29] QuietLighter: Im gonna guess because Geng is his favorite lck team this year
[3:34:42] Phaetox: T1 became my fav because najin and jinair are gone NotLikeThis
[3:34:47] Fissiccisst: the fact that Lucid did get away is still amazing though
[3:35:03] najafan: I stand behind S5 CJ Entus.
[3:35:29] mjoll_the_hotness: i was a little skt fanboy since the worlds finals of 2017 and then they got choked for 3 games and it hurt too much
[3:35:38] mjoll_the_hotness: still recovering
[3:35:42] killerpineapple1: fishing ashe arrow yet again
[3:36:03] Phaetox: We call that the piglet
[3:36:03] Aoyos_: Zeka better win mvp with that stellar performance
[3:36:05] QuietLighter: ill have you know he got 0 Pog votes.
[3:36:08] JeeFour: this is a lesson to us all, never to give up.
[3:36:11] buttp0undr420: Zeka's Corki is the Brock Purdy of LCK
[3:36:13] Fissiccisst: thats when the cristoPLEB s are like Zeka MVP?
[3:36:17] fIuffee: Zeka is easily the best midlaner in LCK atm
[3:36:18] JeeFour: no matter how bad you are
[3:37:05] najafan: @hertzyu My GOAT team didn't even go to worlds, when they were arguably the best team in the world during parts of S5.
[3:37:12] mjoll_the_hotness: and i always had a soft spot for bang dunno why
[3:37:15] SomeFerretGuy: @JeeFour and yet some folks in here were crying half an hour ago that pros should be allowed to ff weirdChamp
[3:37:16] Aoyos_: Lucid is way too manly for DK, he's gonna die a ton this year off lack of support
[3:37:44] srysorry: Why is DK so bad
[3:37:46] Zelgius: zeka 8 kda with baron steal, mvp for sure
[3:37:46] teemu113: LNG upset inc?
