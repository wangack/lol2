[2:43:46] undefined314: So now it's chat's fault
[2:43:54] undefined314: tinakiBurn
[2:43:57] Moonrake: I too hit everyone skillshot when I'm not streaming
[2:44:40] ydubliu: u play vex too
[2:44:43] Topcatrs88: if your obs is using video encoding instead of cpu encoding its going to affect your fps while streaming
[2:45:10] tenglee0139: I think it’s more scary to face a one trick ngl
[2:45:15] Topcatrs88: its why some streamers tend to use dual pc setups
[2:45:19] heyhellos: xdd
[2:45:29] sennabon_: ayy the weekend playlist kicking in
[2:45:40] heyhellos: peepoPooPoo
[2:46:26] undefined314: Dual setup is gonna be the way to go as Twitch starts offloading more transcoding duties to streamers
[2:46:33] LoganRDJ: DO YOU WANT TO PLAY VAL

[2:46:56] heyhellos: wb
[2:47:06] undefined314: The streaming PC doesn't need super high specs, mainly need a capture card
[2:47:15] LoganRDJ: how long are u gonna play league for
[2:47:27] Topcatrs88: That's what youtube is for
[2:47:30] Topcatrs88: Kappa
[2:47:33] ProCactus167: Off loading is only going to happen with av1
[2:47:45] rayspire: can u flaten my bal ls
[2:47:49] ProCactus167: So with 40 series or 7000 series amd
[2:48:00] rayspire: lol jk
[2:48:06] fallenbouse: YEP better off watching youtube guides for 4 hours than pay someone to do it
[2:48:10] undefined314: That's not solved by a local dual PC setup.
[2:48:21] undefined314: Streaming server, some kind of RTSP middleman
[2:48:28] Topcatrs88: Its 2 internet companies
[2:48:30] Gaage: yo
[2:48:36] sennabon_: *first blood*
[2:48:53] tenglee0139: just gotta have more redundancies in place, but yeah cost more money for better services
[2:49:12] undefined314: So much drama already in the game chat LUL
[2:49:27] sennabon_: we are gonna be here a while
[2:49:30] undefined314: ^
[2:49:31] Nightbot: ^
[2:49:35] ireneS2_: sally do you have to play league before playing TFT?
[2:49:40] fallenbouse: praying on your downfall KEKW
[2:49:57] fallenbouse: that's your support
[2:49:58] itskay1: thats a support
[2:50:00] sennabon_: he is a shaco support
[2:50:08] undefined314: Didn't that guy tell another player to off themselves
[2:50:11] undefined314: Yikes
[2:50:11] Nightbot: !yikes
[2:50:23] ProCactus167: Yeah that's a huge perk. A second pc is literally only a good cpu and  capture card. A nice gpu if you want a 1 so you can stream in nice high resolution and frame rate
[2:50:26] sennabon_: minion agro doin work
[2:50:46] tenglee0139: bruh irelia is like my worst nightmare, if they’re good it’s joever
