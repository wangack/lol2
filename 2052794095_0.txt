[3:04:52] xSea: I would like to visit the US to try food over there tbh

[3:08:11] xSea: A streamer I watch always eats that everyday with quadtruple meat and cheese so I had like to assume it has to be insanely good
[3:08:34] potatoboiya: ngl with new fleet of footwork azir build makes azir so much more noob friendly
[3:09:33] xSea: Either way US is a long way. But I'm genuinely quite interested in the quality of US food and the culture

[3:58:03] hodsic: lacF
[3:58:05] Itchyfingerz_: @unreal_fps the information you got (not watched for a year) on screen was slightly different in the region that has gen g T1 etc etc so I enjoyed the information I was getting from the broadcasters and display. then couldn‚Äôt get used to it being different in other regions so I stopped watching it

[4:00:59] Life_Subtractor: are you excited for Apex s20? the changes look kinda nice so far. they only need to keep broken moon out of rotation and it could be pretty good

[4:05:08] AdoriJahad: @hodsic good shit
[4:05:47] shannnn0n: datekaPikao
[4:05:51] AdoriJahad: wigg was saying maybe zaine
[4:06:07] Life_Subtractor: the speach was ok, but the timing was super bad. the biggest mistake in the 2nd game was dezign mistiming his medkit
[4:06:15] quackisalive: Of course Fnatic would be the first team to get bonus points.
[4:06:21] xSea: Went out to buy chicken briyani for dinner
[4:06:37] Itchyfingerz_: zaine is world class and earned a bit of dough
[4:06:44] hodsic: wat didn't they get 5th with him
[4:06:45] AdoriJahad: mande leaving his team would look bad
[4:06:48] nymphadorabee: i mean they have effect idk about picking up a random roller player just because
[4:06:54] hodsic: split 2
[4:07:07] Itchyfingerz_: maybe he just needed a bit of a break to enjoy his winnings
[4:07:09] Life_Subtractor: they need a support player. yuk I was their support
[4:07:16] Uoona: the classic "hasnt he been caught cheating" KEKW
[4:07:32] fiinixxwrite: donkiArrive hello guys
[4:07:48] esbacote: mande was sub when effect gone, but idk about him in main
[4:07:50] Itchyfingerz_: unlucky?
[4:07:58] Life_Subtractor: Mande is not so unlikely, since he is a good flexible support/anchor
[4:08:07] AdoriJahad: nick mf mercs
[4:08:22] Life_Subtractor: and he did perform with them on LAN
[4:08:23] aceaway: unlucky has really good mechanics
[4:08:30] nymphadorabee: shoutout legends playing fucking 8 hours of games :) that was so great :)
[4:08:36] fiinixxwrite: mande is washed according to himself
[4:09:08] Itchyfingerz_: Mande is in TSM is that a problem?
[4:09:19] nymphadorabee: cc for tsm, like the alb thing
[4:09:26] fiinixxwrite: he is in tsm as a content creator anyway
[4:09:36] esbacote: mande is streamer for tsm, just like timmy for 100t
[4:09:56] Itchyfingerz_: Alliance would want a streamer as well
[4:10:23] hodsic: prolly mid
[4:10:25] hodsic: that shit BUSTED
[4:11:15] RipYourRng: theres worse champs than karma rn tbh like tf
[4:11:17] Itchyfingerz_: so I‚Äôd expect the replacement for yuki to have an average of over 100 viewers
[4:11:32] AdoriJahad: 25 stack eve scary sight for a squishy
[4:11:35] RipYourRng: with his rework its broken right now
[4:12:00] AdoriJahad: too hot for league
[4:12:03] AdoriJahad: i mean apex
[4:12:11] nymphadorabee: far too hot to be a professional gamer i mean
[4:12:14] Itchyfingerz_: yuki is just not the same player
[4:12:14] RipYourRng: how are you like hwei
[4:12:15] nymphadorabee: good god
[4:12:21] RipYourRng: liking*
[4:12:34] nymphadorabee: please go back to modelling the world needs you
[4:12:35] esbacote: yea, he's kinda off for a while
[4:12:56] rizard: PHASE RUSH
[4:12:56] RipYourRng: have you tried smolder yet?
[4:12:59] rizard: HE ZOOMIN
[4:13:15] Itchyfingerz_: having Yuki around makes people question the age of players affecting ability
[4:13:24] RipYourRng: hes weak as hell at the start. and then he plays like ezreal and kogmaw had a baby
[4:13:29] AdoriJahad: omg hans
[4:13:32] AdoriJahad: holyyyyy
[4:13:59] Rotten_wood: He really turned into a different person
[4:14:03] hodsic: only apex thinks that shit matters, there's so many other esports with folks in their 30s that are absolute gods @Itchyfingerz_
[4:14:05] AdoriJahad: kpop idol hansama
[4:14:13] nymphadorabee: hear me out did he change completely or did he get a new haircut
[4:14:42] esbacote: but god damn i just now know yuki was a model, no wonder bro so fabulous
[4:15:10] RipYourRng: idk what secondary runes he might have. since hes bot he might have taken armor
[4:15:13] AdoriJahad: varus needs roller aimassist
[4:15:19] nymphadorabee: @esbacote stalk him on instagram he used to model for gucci
[4:15:20] OscarPLM: They removed armor on runes no?
[4:15:28] xSea: I heard league has their own invoker of sorts now
[4:15:33] RipYourRng: @OscarPLM i dont remember tbh
[4:15:42] hodsic: yeah its the character noc is playing @xSea
[4:15:53] Itchyfingerz_: @hodsic i don‚Äôt mean to sound off but it‚Äôs playing a video game not sprinting the 100 meters. eyesight and the will to do it is more important than age I think
[4:15:53] OscarPLM: WAIT
[4:16:03] OscarPLM: you play ASDF BASED
[4:16:12] xSea: Ooh looks kinda interesting
[4:16:30] RipYourRng: i dont think i could play one row lower
[4:16:33] rizard: phase rushed into his death smh
[4:16:42] RipYourRng: what the heck you got on qwer then?
[4:16:44] Rotten_wood: ASDF is crazy
[4:16:47] SaberBrideFallen: they didnt kill the minions faster to let the tower hit you
[4:16:57] RipYourRng: oh ad.
[4:17:02] I_JubJub: I_JubJub subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! nocturnalWave
[4:18:19] hodsic: i agree 100%, i'm js that apex community thinks age matters when it really doesn't as much as other factors @Itchyfingerz_
[4:18:51] SaberBrideFallen: GIGACHAD alistar
[4:19:02] xSea: @hodsic unless its dota and everyone copies the TI winner team building comp nocturnalLUL
[4:20:21] Itchyfingerz_: @hodsic I think it‚Äôs just the younger average age probably. a year ago some players were retiring in their early 20‚Äôs. which sounds crazy in any other industry
[4:20:25] OscarPLM: Careful he's going to have trailblazer by 20min
[4:21:09] hodsic: most everyone in esports retires cause they just burnout and don't feel the drive for it like they used to compared to real sports where they just get to their end
[4:21:32] Itchyfingerz_: yeah
[4:22:26] Rotten_wood: I thought the number 1 reason esports players quit was shit like carpal tunnel?
[4:22:40] hodsic: some do but that's on the rarer side
[4:22:47] xSea: mostly its burn out
[4:23:03] hodsic: most retire cause they burn out and/or its not lucrative enough
[4:23:08] xSea: playing everyday for 10-16 hrs a day is kinda fucked
[4:23:26] hodsic: it is actually super rare that they retire cause of injury
[4:23:28] hodsic: but it do happen
[4:24:12] rizard: IM IN
[4:24:13] xSea: imagine a GunZ esports where everyone retire from carpal tunnel though
[4:25:56] rizard: added gay single bear o7
[4:26:08] Rotten_wood: they buffed the dragons
[4:28:54] iDecypher: noc
[4:28:55] iDecypher: why
[4:28:59] maelkk: loryLurk
[4:29:02] iDecypher: why did u shit talk valorant then hop on fucking LEAGUE
[4:29:04] maelkk: Hiyo Noc loryCute
[4:29:12] hodsic: decy
[4:29:14] hodsic: valorant is horrible
[4:29:29] iDecypher: think the league community is miles worse
[4:29:40] iDecypher: @hodsic its horrible when u suck so it makes sense
[4:29:42] veoko_: decy seems like a val kinda guy tryna find an egirl
[4:29:45] hodsic: decy
[4:29:48] hodsic: i literally calibrated diamond
[4:29:49] iDecypher: not anymore @veoko_
[4:29:51] hodsic: and your ass is silver
[4:29:52] hodsic: stfu
[4:29:52] esbacote: holup, how in the hell you put league and valorant in the same level
[4:29:55] iDecypher: wtf does calibrated mean
[4:30:11] hodsic: people who blow at those games think val is fun
[4:30:17] veoko_: u gave up your search then
[4:30:25] iDecypher: no i found a gf
[4:30:28] darthsabin: good morning king!
[4:30:42] veoko_: oh good for you then congrats :)
[4:31:47] VerdantPines: nocturnalHydrate
[4:32:04] esbacote: league is ass which is bad but you still have fun with it, while val just straight up suck balls
[4:32:40] Rotten_wood: league is great most of the time valorant is never great
[4:32:41] Uoona: id rather suck ass than suck balls KKona
[4:32:42] iDecypher: swiftplay...
[4:32:43] SaberBrideFallen: TRUEING
[4:32:53] hodsic: valorant content creators threw the towel in WAY faster than apex creators and that's saying something
[4:33:11] iLumiRick: 7 raiders from iLumiRick have joined! 
[4:33:21] iLumiRick: hi noc
[4:33:29] esbacote: W rickkk
[4:33:30] veoko_: yea bc what content is there on val besides smurf to. radiant on Jett #100000
[4:33:39] iLumiRick: ive been lurking watching you while i was streaming maple LMFAOOOO
[4:33:39] rizard: DAMN HE WAS WORTH A BAND???? LETS GOOOO
[4:33:55] iLumiRick: also decy im proud of you
[4:34:00] iLumiRick: happy for you brother
[4:34:18] iLumiRick: no youre good brother
[4:34:28] iLumiRick: we'll run it literally whenever
[4:34:29] iLumiRick: im vibin
[4:34:38] iLumiRick: makes me have to grind maplestory more and make the money i spent back Deadge
[4:35:00] quackisalive: Is maplestory the game where they set gacha rates to 0%?
[4:35:49] VerdantPines: Hod are you still lurking?
[4:35:56] Unreal_fps: Why do people want to pretend league community is toxic
[4:36:14] quackisalive: @Unreal_fps As a new player. It's the most toxic game i've played
[4:36:16] esbacote: what do you mean pretend?
[4:36:27] OscarPLM: 35k? bro
[4:36:39] Unreal_fps: Its weird narrative everyone has just decided to collectively lie about
[4:36:47] Rotten_wood: @Unreal_fps you think it's pretending?
[4:36:48] SaberBrideFallen: they don't pretend they embrace it GIGACHAD
[4:36:52] iLumiRick: KEKW
[4:36:52] Unreal_fps: the only time league was toxic was when smurf queue existed
[4:36:55] esbacote: it is toxic and we're vibin with it
[4:37:02] iLumiRick: how much better is apex tho than league
[4:37:08] esbacote: we live in this sludge
[4:37:10] OscarPLM: being a league NA pro is not worth it
[4:37:14] Unreal_fps: because half of the people where on new accs and were permabanned
[4:37:14] iLumiRick: TRUE
[4:37:37] Itchyfingerz_: what age did you retire as a semi pro league player noc?
[4:37:38] Unreal_fps: league is the least toxic game ive played
[4:37:40] Rotten_wood: bro the other day I missed a single cannon and got called a slur
[4:37:50] Unreal_fps: except like tft
[4:37:57] Unreal_fps: but does that really count
[4:37:57] xSea: Maybe he muted everyone and everything so he can't hear anything
[4:38:02] Uoona: play any game of ranked a singular game KEKW
[4:38:05] Unreal_fps: now CSGO
[4:38:08] Unreal_fps: is toxic
[4:38:13] veoko_: apex is much better than league or val when it comes to the community imo. but then again I'm better than most of my randoms so I don't get flamed as much lol
[4:38:22] quackisalive: I had a guy with a homophobic slur name in my game and feed when he saw my name
[4:38:26] Unreal_fps: idk you're just one of the people who have decided to join the collective lie I guess
[4:38:42] iLumiRick: jesus fucking christ
[4:38:47] esbacote: collective lie KEKW
[4:38:54] iLumiRick: league valorant and cs have the worsst communities on the planet
[4:38:54] Rotten_wood: This guy is baiting don't even
[4:38:55] rizard: sometimes just acknowledging someone's presence will make them int you KEKW
[4:38:58] Unreal_fps: They get banned literally instantly.
[4:38:59] iLumiRick: and it doesnt even come close
[4:39:04] iLumiRick: apex is prob behind them tho
[4:39:11] iLumiRick: if you ignore the good part of the apex community
[4:39:20] iLumiRick: devs sleepin COPIUM
[4:39:24] VerdantPines: better than smoking ethereal dick?
[4:39:32] Unreal_fps: Nah
[4:39:34] iLumiRick: very true
[4:39:43] kappattack: i quit league like 10 years ago and never went back because it was SO toxic and i've never once been tempted to go back
[4:39:48] veoko_: LeaguePlayer
[4:39:50] esbacote: the fact he said collective lie as counter point is unreal KEKW
[4:40:15] themajorbox: i got the name Major Long Dong, so i'll take what i can
[4:40:18] SaberBrideFallen: alistar powerspike monkaW
[4:40:19] veoko_: we're all collective witness to noc's self harm
[4:40:33] Unreal_fps: League takes toxicity very seriously and it shows on the community
[4:40:45] BlurrFlavorz: dropping by before i sleep
[4:40:50] BlurrFlavorz: luv u Û†ÄÄ
[4:40:51] hodsic: noc please man he's baiting
[4:40:55] quackisalive: tbf I am baiting the braindeads with the name botlaneboykisser
[4:40:55] BlurrFlavorz: hope you have good games
[4:40:57] Unreal_fps: I am not baiting.
[4:41:02] Rotten_wood: Noc it's just a troll do not pay attention to him please
[4:41:14] themajorbox: it's not toxic it's culture
[4:41:14] BlurrFlavorz: handsome man @hodsic
[4:41:42] OscarPLM: "in game yourself" is something I've heard at least half a dozen times the past week
[4:41:46] esbacote: he's not baiting, he just stay too long in tft and csgo and think league is better place KEKW
[4:41:47] iLumiRick: they take it seriously but for all they do the community is better now than it used to be
[4:41:51] iLumiRick: but its definitely still giga fucked
[4:41:58] xSea: You know how a toxic community can be if they ban friendly chat? or something
[4:42:00] iLumiRick: and still worse than prob every other community
[4:42:05] Unreal_fps: Its not half as bad as people pretend it is
[4:42:14] iLumiRick: true but you could say that about most games
[4:42:22] Unreal_fps: riot has done an amazing job
[4:42:24] esbacote: but it is still toxic KEKW
[4:42:32] iLumiRick: LMFAO
[4:42:33] SaberBrideFallen: riot glazer
[4:43:04] Rotten_wood: That account has to be a new ai programmed by riot themselves
[4:43:04] esbacote: bro tryin to get a piece of that riot money
[4:43:10] Rotten_wood: There's just no way
[4:43:49] xSea: I would glaze league too for money
[4:43:51] esbacote: don't forget to send your paypal info to riot
[4:44:14] iLumiRick: that brother is gaming my god
[4:44:27] iLumiRick: noc is this my playlist KEKW
[4:44:40] iLumiRick: i stg every song in here plays for me every time i play my playlist
[4:44:54] iLumiRick: but then again i also jus thave like every relatively anime song known to man in that shit KEKW
[4:45:10] iLumiRick: AINTNOWAY
[4:45:17] shannnn0n: merryDog
[4:45:22] iLumiRick: that mf was so horny for you
[4:45:54] iLumiRick: PauseChamp
[4:45:58] VerdantPines: You know, Theres times when i think i wanna play league
[4:45:59] iLumiRick: did we win PauseChamp
[4:46:03] iLumiRick: ive never played league PauseChamp
[4:46:05] iLumiRick: OH WE WON
[4:46:07] iLumiRick: LETSGO
[4:46:14] VerdantPines: then i remember that i hulk smashed my mouse into pieces from just apex
[4:46:16] iLumiRick: holy shit LMFAO
[4:46:23] rizard: maligma is not okay
[4:46:24] iLumiRick: support btw
[4:46:28] iLumiRick: ligma?
[4:46:40] iLumiRick: based
[4:46:41] iLumiRick: ligma
[4:47:10] iLumiRick: i will never play league
[4:47:11] iLumiRick: probably
[4:47:17] iLumiRick: apex was hell for me
[4:47:19] themajorbox: league is the first rage bait game
[4:47:22] iLumiRick: so i know league will only be worse
[4:47:23] quackisalive: Grinding Og MW2 8 hours a day made me immune to anything league can throw at me
[4:47:24] rizard: wanting to learn league is one of the wildest drugs
[4:47:29] OscarPLM: getting into league is only  worth it if you have someone to play with
[4:47:35] OscarPLM: do not start playing the game solo
[4:47:42] Unreal_fps: the reality is that in csgo you can get away with the names you described indefinitely but league a week at best. Devs response to toxicty will always make a huge impact esp over long term
[4:47:44] VerdantPines: @rizard like next to meth?
[4:47:48] iLumiRick: yeah all of decys tweets
[4:47:58] xSea: sometimes i watch this and i feel like installing dota again.

[4:52:49] xSea: Not legally, but some people keep it anyway, and most cats are strays that people feed on the apartment void decks
[4:52:58] YaYa_KSA: rating this game 1 to 10 !
[4:53:04] esbacote: @xSea in apartment? because singapore still have house right?
[4:53:09] veoko_: isn't like the lion one of the most iconic animals in singapore
[4:53:13] YaYa_KSA: nice
[4:53:14] xSea: However, they are passing a law that allow cats as pets this year on iirc
[4:53:22] YaYa_KSA: that is true
[4:53:37] xSea: @xSea the vast majority of singaporeans live in apartment flats due to lack of space
[4:54:02] hodsic: no you're a black screen
