[0:20:57] ikes9711: Game to play with friends, stimulates the lizard brain
[0:21:08] burntcard: how???

[0:21:40] ikes9711: I hate games like rust
[0:21:41] Skaglicker: league game is a commitment of 20min, gives feel of control
[0:22:12] sorrobou: I play cuz i love receiving verbal abuse
[0:22:38] burntcard: that not fun
[0:22:44] ikes9711: Gimme satisfactory, astroneer, cities skylines or something most of the time. I enjoy the salt with the homies
[0:23:08] Skaglicker: i think league is more complex then valo, makes it more attractive to me
[0:23:18] ikes9711: I'm way too fucking high to still have reaction time for fps
[0:23:18] AludArg: flash alpha to lee didint kill her?
[0:23:35] canadianthreat: I like how there's new Champs and it's changes
[0:23:44] Skaglicker: also about every shooter I touched felt better than valorant LUL
[0:23:58] Squigg: i dont think i was ever really addicted, early on in season 2 and 3 i enjoyed the game as a whole things were new it was fun finding new champions to play and how their kit works and winning games, especially the 50+ min games where you pull a win you feel so achieved but now... its just flash in a pan over before they started games its boring i dont care to put the time in and it requires too much time to climb for nothing and idk i just dont care xD
[0:24:27] Knijz: halo evrynian
[0:24:50] ikes9711: I haven't enjoyed fps in a long time though, like battlefield 4 or maybe black ops 3
[0:24:53] DaoUnchained: Squigg like 65% of my games are early surrenders ._.

[0:55:49] Knijz: making stuff by yourself is so fun
[0:55:57] EricGreenTrading: Even the multistreaming chat function is actually really interesting and fulfills a growing market need. Twitch is allowing multistreaming now so more large streamers are going to consider it. I've seen a handful of the largest streamers try a few YouTube streams already. Fracturing the chat is one of the largest drawbacks to multistream so consolidating chats like that is kinda huge to keep the community together.

[3:46:35] Knijz: bro i tried to do a custom input chat that can hold img, was a pain in the ass i gave up
[3:46:36] dargon6: @Klewas high settings
[3:46:36] cahallo: just steal 7tv design for emotes :)
[3:46:40] Knijz: if u figure it out send dm
[3:46:59] Klewas: @dargon6 No his game just looks nicer I have high too
[3:47:16] Knijz: like twitch bro, when you type the emote name the emote image appears in the input
[3:47:20] dargon6: @Klewas what gpu do you have
[3:47:52] Klewas: @dargon6 1080ti
[3:47:58] alonzo_carlo: oh so when you tsype the emote, it will transform into the emote in the chatbox itself LUL
[3:47:59] Knijz: apparently inputs can only hold text so... yeah
[3:48:28] dargon6: @Klewas then idk...i was gonna say maybe you have low vram. You probably just have to tinker around with settings

[3:49:34] Tomrin: damn, i haven't played this game in like 10 years and yi 's gotten some drip
[3:49:36] ricklecter: they are waiting for u to carry them
[3:50:01] cahallo: @dargon6 , twitch bitrate, refresh rate? a lot of the time the 60fps from the stream rendering look more fluid than in game, not a league exclusive situation
[3:50:37] JBNex: Your team is terminal
[3:50:48] alonzo_carlo: I couldnt imagine playing this game for a living I get super frustrated after even one game
[3:50:53] painpapi5000: Aware
[3:51:00] dargon6: @cahallo not true...native is always better than the quality of something that is streamed
[3:51:25] cahallo: @dargon6 no
[3:51:30] dargon6: lol ok
[3:51:37] cahallo: if you are streaming the game
[3:51:44] cahallo: not a recording of the game
[3:51:50] alonzo_carlo: gg man
[3:51:51] xAstra021: bye bye
[3:51:51] Knijz: :( short stream
[3:51:54] Klewas: When you said 69 60 100 is that in game settings or nvidia or where?
