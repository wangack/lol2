[0:28:34] Angelise_s: Yeah the passive behavior in lane from her was def a little.. questionableee D:
[0:28:35] NamesBond_007: so what should i do be good support?
[0:28:38] valdaftw: Baiter team
[0:29:27] ajdude455: wtf is that yone doing??

[0:32:48] imtehForest: unlucky game lost
[0:32:59] ajdude455: @imtehForest ??
[0:33:12] Angelise_s: The senna def griefed you in most ways LMAO
[0:33:54] Angelise_s: See? Senna/Sona gaming. But that's such like.. an interesting choice of champs to main
[0:34:07] Angelise_s: In combination I mean
[0:34:08] imtehForest: @ajdude455 he tpd into that slow
[0:34:10] imtehForest: well cc
[0:34:17] NamesBond_007: so how to be a better support?
[0:34:52] Rose_blinkssss: the senna made more damage??
[0:35:00] Angelise_s: loaded question
[0:35:21] valdaftw: If you have riven vs irelia top go gank that shit
[0:35:54] brocchloe_: brocchloe_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[0:35:57] VengfulDark: Supports need to learn wave timers, and wave management of all 3 lanes.
[0:36:37] Angelise_s: I think there is something to be said about the roams potentially didn't go poorly *because* of them, but they didn't leave you in a good position in lane either before making that call.
[0:36:47] Angelise_s: Like their laning behavior was BIZZARRE
[0:37:13] solpiperita: brocchloe_ 🥦 5upWave
[0:37:18] VengfulDark: Also if you are roaming when you come back it helps if you bring your jungler down with you
[0:37:26] brocchloe_: 5upWave
[0:37:38] Rose_blinkssss: is your main role adc?
[0:37:47] balletbunny: PikaWave
[0:38:22] pureiinsanity: unless they are morgana
[0:38:37] valdaftw: How do you feel about ez btw, don't you feel he's a bit overrated ?
[0:39:09] Angelise_s: Yeah it was kinda giving champ select diff
[0:39:29] VengfulDark: Another bad support thing is not matching the positioning of your ADC in lane, if one walks up walk up with them if possible.
[0:39:34] Angelise_s: they don't take smolder Prayge Prayge
[0:39:40] solpiperita: Prayge
[0:39:57] valdaftw: rip
[0:40:09] Angelise_s: THE BAN PepeHands
[0:40:19] solpiperita: BLUBBERS
[0:40:23] pureiinsanity: renata?
[0:40:40] VengfulDark: Kog would be bad in this situation, but is he playable?
[0:40:58] pureiinsanity: they dont expect it to be ADC and you have AD mid AD top
[0:41:02] pureiinsanity: so i think it was fine here
[0:41:05] taytayabby: Sol catKISS
[0:41:12] imtehForest: solsol
[0:41:25] valdaftw: Kog's very situational, like you can't pick him vs that team for example
[0:41:46] solpiperita: tay catKISS
[0:41:49] VengfulDark: Naut is an alright support here.
[0:41:51] solpiperita: forest peepoCheer
[0:41:58] Angelise_s: SAVED

[0:42:49] VengfulDark: GM @otiswilbur
[0:42:59] otiswilbur: woke up on the wrong side of the queue :)
[0:43:24] otiswilbur: i had the craziest racist support player yesterday, you would not believe it OMEGALUL
[0:43:42] VengfulDark: There are a few supports that I have asked to leave lane because they were SO bad it was easier to 1v2
[0:43:48] spookylvian: spookylvian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 22 months das crazy almost a year???
[0:43:51] otiswilbur: support players are wild sometimes
[0:44:00] taytayabby: Kylv catKISS
[0:44:13] solpiperita: kylv pogg
[0:44:17] spookylvian: hi tay <33
[0:44:20] VengfulDark: Smolder is probably underpreforming low elo.
[0:44:22] otiswilbur: riot might deserve a perma ban from their own game soon Susge
[0:44:27] spookylvian: hey sol hehe
[0:44:45] solpiperita: pepeD
[0:44:59] otiswilbur: ngl, they might buff the E, it feels kinda underwhelming KEKW
[0:45:18] VengfulDark: His True damage burn could scale up to 6% just getting instant 6% is crazy
[0:45:44] otiswilbur: tbh
[0:45:50] otiswilbur: the execute should scale with max hp
[0:45:55] otiswilbur: up to 6%
[0:46:09] otiswilbur: call me crazy
[0:46:11] otiswilbur: like
[0:46:16] otiswilbur: a mundo would get executed at 6%
[0:46:19] otiswilbur: but some
[0:46:22] otiswilbur: 2k hp adc wont
[0:47:39] Fossabot: @pureiinsanity, Please ask for permission to post a link. [warning]
[0:47:47] otiswilbur: me :)
[0:47:48] VengfulDark: His burn is probably not even doing as much as his passive
[0:47:54] toytrainsgoburr: not5upWiggle
[0:49:10] balletbunny: Waiting
[0:49:12] otiswilbur: oh hell no, i just dodged the dirtiest enemy team comp ever OMEGALUL
[0:49:29] pureiinsanity: We dont see btw

[0:50:01] otiswilbur: could be ap and ad scaling ngl
[0:50:10] Rose_blinkssss: isnt aphelios the hardest champion to learn? i gave up playing him lol
[0:50:10] VengfulDark: if Q was an auto reset.
[0:50:17] Swifyz: hi hi
[0:51:02] Swifyz: I watched one of your old among us videos
[0:51:08] Swifyz: and my perspective has changed
[0:51:09] VengfulDark: they removed most of the hybrid items.
[0:51:24] Swifyz: like I’m never trusting you
[0:51:29] solpiperita: om
[0:51:45] solpiperita: which vid Swifyz ?

[0:52:47] NamesBond_007: but they dont trust you when needed xd
[0:52:51] Lena_mmmm: HypeSleep elo
[0:52:58] VengfulDark: I started following 5UP from Amongus. And you did some dirty plays
[0:53:05] otiswilbur: i was never there for the among us days :)
[0:53:10] Swifyz: I mean fun is fun sowmtimes
[0:53:23] pureiinsanity: old 5up is a different breed
[0:53:29] VengfulDark: I am really bad at those games, I have an untrustworthy voice.
[0:53:35] TheKimeo: Whatever happened to that duck imposter game?
[0:53:39] Swifyz: I’ll say it
[0:53:42] Swifyz: I hate the modded stuff
[0:53:52] Swifyz: thank you
[0:53:55] The_Moep: imo tryharding should push the others to tryhard too. most fun that way
[0:54:02] Lena_mmmm: daily morning lobby was peak
[0:54:03] Swifyz: I’m so glad you keep one lobby around like that
[0:54:11] taytayabby: Lena catKISS
[0:54:18] otiswilbur: i saw some weird ass role in a modded among us video, he could rewind time or smth OMEGALUL

[0:55:04] pureiinsanity: they are lost in the sauce
[0:55:13] Swifyz: please do
[0:55:19] Swifyz: voet is halarious
[0:55:22] dennyspancakes: something silly like a title for the day/week for the most wins/correct calls
[0:55:25] solpiperita: voet pepeD
[0:55:26] otiswilbur: @The_Moep ah, ive never played among us, so idk, i feel like id just get confused KEKW
[0:55:33] Swifyz: there should also be a rule to like fight no matter what the situation is
[0:55:33] solpiperita: naurr hahaha
[0:55:35] VengfulDark: They have shown people that if people have below a 30% win rate they will just drop a game.
[0:55:41] Swifyz: some just were like damn you seen me kill Ggs
[0:55:41] VengfulDark: Same with above a certain win rate
[0:55:58] Swifyz: nah it makes it more fun
[0:55:58] solpiperita: not 5up tho he's built diff
[0:56:03] The_Moep: it's a game about lying...
[0:56:06] Luminoxie: bad liars are the best liars
[0:56:15] Swifyz: I also think it really is just game knowledge too
[0:56:19] underageducking: What's your twitch?
[0:56:28] pureiinsanity: people that dread being imposter
[0:56:35] balletbunny: 5updota
[0:56:39] Swifyz: like people didn’t know what admin was
[0:56:49] piveel: hallo
[0:56:50] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[0:56:56] balletbunny: StillWaiting
[0:56:58] aliciaravenscar: Thats the reason i hated proximity chat trend. People just payed for comedy, no trying at all.
[0:57:01] VengfulDark: I think you could be good at Amongus being 100% hones
[0:57:16] The_Moep: try hard proximity is sick af though
[0:57:16] Swifyz: it’s crazy to me some people never played Fortnite
[0:57:22] NamesBond_007: like if you dont know Dwain okay, but admin?
[0:57:23] The_Moep: as you can strategize
[0:57:23] otiswilbur: wait
[0:57:28] otiswilbur: smolder's voice actor is a dog?
[0:57:31] Swifyz: proxy would be so much fun
[0:57:59] Swifyz: I mean do we need more people?
[0:58:09] pureiinsanity: @Swifyz i haven't, i dont like FPS
[0:58:09] piveel: @otiswilbur yea
[0:58:21] VengfulDark: I have 1 game of Fortnite. My friend carried me to first place. I didn't hit a single shot. @Swifyz
[0:58:21] otiswilbur: @piveel thats funny af
[0:58:28] Swifyz: yes 10 is the best imo
[0:58:35] The_Moep: I played among us daily for a while and even the "bad" players improved fast
[0:58:51] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[0:58:59] Swifyz: oh check dms when you got a chance
[0:59:10] balletbunny: would not watch that tbh
[0:59:12] Nam3Lessz: do you think anything can be done about tasks being pointless?
[0:59:41] pureiinsanity: task snapping doesn't help either
[0:59:47] Swifyz: yo yo listen
[0:59:51] otiswilbur: I remember when xqc played among us peepoGiggles
[0:59:51] Swifyz: 40 player lobby’s aren’t easy
[0:59:57] Swifyz: task snapping is so annoying
[1:00:15] demaaaa03: !opgg
[1:00:15] Fossabot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/5up?hl=en_US
[1:00:27] NamesBond_007: @otiswilbur no dont remind me, the trauma
[1:00:37] solpiperita: wuts task snapping
[1:00:40] balletbunny: dragon GAMING
[1:00:42] The_Moep: tasks could be improved by adding some kind of unlock feature for the crew depending on the amount of tasks done (like admin etc. unlocking)
[1:00:49] Swifyz: way to hard clear
[1:00:53] solpiperita: ahh that
[1:00:54] taytayabby: phenex1Lost
[1:01:00] solpiperita: 5upNotes
[1:01:02] pureiinsanity: @solpiperita people teleport on top of tasks
[1:01:07] otiswilbur: kinda like med scan waddle?
[1:01:17] Swifyz: my favorite when we play is when someone gets voted out when they are hard cleaned
[1:01:22] The_Moep: the solution for task snapping is to let imposters be able to do all tasks
[1:01:47] slo75om: hey how are you doing 5up ?
[1:02:03] otiswilbur: what even are the devs up to ngl
[1:02:04] Swifyz: would proxy lobby be fun?
[1:02:09] pureiinsanity: Sona lane you love those
[1:02:12] The_Moep: fixing bugs is unrealistic xD
[1:02:15] piveel: sorcery on smolder? is it good or it’s first time trying it
[1:02:19] taytayabby: Rosieshockblink
[1:02:20] Swifyz: oh yeah that’s true
[1:02:23] dennyspancakes: why comet?
[1:02:25] VengfulDark: No one made a mod that just fixed task snap?
[1:02:39] VioletDisorder: proximity only work with mods like arsonist cus then they cant group too much
[1:02:56] VengfulDark: good point.
[1:03:17] pureiinsanity: modded for vanilla among us LUL
[1:03:44] Swifyz: what happend to lethal

[1:10:08] TheKimeo: I love smolders little walk
[1:10:36] Luminoxie: I think a Lulu support could be pog on Smolder, movement speed buff and all
[1:10:37] piveel: is teleport better than ghost for smolder or it depends on situation

[2:47:14] xxKnowledgerxx: the season finale of Hazbin Hotel was kinda disappointing sajj

[2:48:38] CoyoteTina: acreCuteDog
[2:51:25] vsmilotic: i wonder whats the issue Kappa
[2:51:30] Gragnoth: @xxKnowledgerxx I agree the pacing was too fast and a bit off, but I disagree about the ending being disappointing, I actually really enjoyed the ending. Sure could have used more episodes but other than that the story was enjoyable.
[2:52:14] BardHearts: fuck man. the ramen i just ate was too spicy and now my stomach hurts
[2:52:26] taytayabby: peepoPat
[2:52:45] MariiWotterii: i would lose my mind with that kayn

[3:04:40] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[3:05:03] CoyoteTina: Is mmr in this game super tight like in Apex where you que with like the same 100 ppl all the time or is it a lil more spread out?
[3:06:25] Dodoberd22: @CoyoteTina i think it's more of a bell curve where the higher you go naturally there will be less people in that mmr so there will be higher likelyhood of running into the same peopel
[3:06:36] CoyoteTina: idk what they did but I'm diamond, an I keep queing with the same predator stack team like 5 games in a row
[3:06:43] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up

[3:10:00] JustaStoopidDog: holy shit the typing already
[3:10:06] CoyoteTina: @Dodoberd22 Might also have to do with the solo life, I get some wildly different teammates, but I always see the same couple champ squads all the time and if they aren't champs, they run into me in game with the same banners. An i'm not even in the top 2 ranks
[3:10:08] Tirmel: baby dragon 5upCry
[3:10:53] balletbunny: old dragon time
[3:10:54] CoyoteTina: Smolder looks so heckin cute

[3:11:54] Tirmel: Back-seat Smolder him /j
[3:11:58] infer_n0: lol
[3:12:02] KAP_out: since when is ad shaco sup a thing? wasnt it always ap?
[3:12:03] chloeiwi: hecarim mid/s
[3:12:09] Dodoberd22: @CoyoteTina maybe cause it's cause literally after your game ends the same group of people queue up again with similar mmr and that's why the system thinks oh ok time to match these people together again, i've had it happen to be when i play back to back arams as well
[3:12:18] BluerBlack: it was always mix
[3:12:28] KAP_out: oh didnt know that
[3:12:28] h3dg3boi: nah play kog'maw or veigar for the stacking even if you dont get smolder
[3:12:33] BluerBlack: ad for q and ap for rest
[3:13:01] CoyoteTina: @Dodoberd22 yeah prolly that too, but dang acreKek  sometimes I wanna chill in my own diamond lobbies an not sweat with preds all day
[3:13:14] hoshiNstar: Can we pool our gift subs for a character, or only limited to one person
[3:13:28] hoshiNstar: Per character request
[3:13:40] NamesBond_007: annie is sup yeah
[3:13:41] Dodoberd22: @CoyoteTina try waiting 3-4 minutes after each match sometimes then, helps to dodge the same group of people
[3:13:53] KAP_out: are the asol changes already live?
[3:14:10] BluerBlack: @hoshiNstar It would be imposible to keep track per char
[3:14:15] ar_pachauri: So how do stacks work on Asol ?
[3:14:45] Dodoberd22: @ar_pachauri kinda like veigars but his e also give stacks if stuff dies in it
[3:14:56] BluerBlack: wtf they did to my dragon
[3:15:03] CoyoteTina: @Dodoberd22 Sometimes, or I que up a TDM or go Three Strikes for a couple games. It's just wild that even in ranked, I'm currently silver, and every champ squad are masters and preds, you literally can't rank up in those conditions
[3:15:36] Dodoberd22: @CoyoteTina ah yes the eve lasting issue of smurfs, a pain
[3:15:47] KAP_out: @BluerBlack e gives less stacks and q gives more and scales better i believe
[3:16:04] Wolfeei: good morning :3
[3:16:07] ar_pachauri: @dodoberd22 so. I don't know how the majority of champions work. Sorry
[3:16:09] Wolfeei: how was mcl
[3:16:25] NamesBond_007: gm
[3:16:51] CoyoteTina: @Dodoberd22 That's not an issue in ranked, cause you have to be account lvl 50 to even que ranked. But to see PRed and Master badges on the banners of half the lobby in silver rank is wild. They should only go down to diamond lobbies
[3:17:05] Wolfeei: nah i wasn't invited
[3:17:09] Dodoberd22: @ar_pachauri the oversimplified version of it it you land spells you get stacks, and if things die in the aoe of the e you gain stacks as well
[3:17:09] Wolfeei: your team seemed rly fun
[3:17:14] NamesBond_007: and sleepy was sick that was sad
[3:17:16] tamuna11: Wolfeei 5upWave
[3:17:29] h3dg3boi: mcl jsut needs to nerf the strength kit, and i dont know how you would change the sir block

[3:17:52] tamuna11: @Traveler4 league but in minecraft

[3:21:14] tamuna11: 5upVent
[3:21:22] NamesBond_007: @CoyoteTina it makes it so unlikeable
[3:21:55] CoyoteTina: The funniest Among Us lobbies are the ones where they name themselves colors, but not the color of their bean, it gets wild
[3:22:01] NamesBond_007: shacko is yapping in that team chat
[3:22:05] vDaishar: kk as long as I didnt miss it
[3:22:33] CoyoteTina: @NameStealer007 I usually play like 2-3 trios lobbies an find out that situation, an be like... welp it's a Mix Tape kinda night acreKek

[3:25:31] CoyoteTina: @h3dg3boi omg. I've had games like that in Gun Run Apex where I'm top fragging the entire lobby, an we're in last place cause my teammates have like 1 kill each
[3:25:32] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond I 26 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[3:26:18] 54v463: this isn't smolder Wut
[3:26:27] h3dg3boi: @CoyoteTina worst part is next map the players who weren't doing good got like 15k each in a 13-8
[3:26:38] balletbunny: smolder grew up a lil
[3:26:39] h3dg3boi: so they just underpreformed like crazy
[3:26:49] CoyoteTina: @h3dg3boi haha musta just been a bad game then

[3:41:35] BluerBlack: its stacking champ
[3:41:47] BluerBlack: the problem is his stacks
[3:41:50] Jinmav: noct is acting to defeated, does he not understand the concept of late game champs?
[3:42:05] NamesBond_007: it can do so much more with dfferent build
[3:42:12] joshopo: i dont think smolder realizes he needs to q the mobs to get the stakcs

[4:32:43] Fossabot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/5up?hl=en_US
[4:33:07] vsmilotic: his kit look really like mid hero
[4:33:22] GrumpySkelly: all Nunu loves you it seems
[4:34:20] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Smolder bot with a support that knows how to play with him is probably his best role, followed by smolder mid fairly closely, followed by smolder with a bad support WAAYYYYYY down at the bottom.
[4:34:30] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I would rather smolder top than with a bad support.
[4:36:25] AkitaAttribute: That cannon minion just roamed from one lane to attack another lane's inhib
[4:36:36] RinaVX: Ap smoulder support is where its at
[4:36:43] lil__soupy: nope
[4:36:44] mpandzioch: Everyday is cursed

[4:39:38] lil__soupy: hi tay puppyKISS
[4:39:42] JickyJack: nidalee!!
[4:39:44] sonaldosui: 5up play missfortune fr fr
[4:39:48] hoshiNstar: Can we pool the subs for a chat determined champ
[4:39:50] Januous: leeg time
[4:39:56] RinaVX: Requesting nasus support gameplay
[4:40:01] AwesomeTree: @hoshiNstar now we're cooking
[4:40:26] VengfulDark: Chat should decide on the champ before hand
[4:40:42] lil__soupy: idk i was playing some quickplay yesterday and i had no supports in bot for every game i played
[4:40:47] RinaVX: Its nasus support or nasus jungle
[4:41:20] VengfulDark: When I go main role Fill I get sent mid.
[4:41:21] taytayabby: !subs
[4:41:21] Fossabot: @taytayabby, 5up currently has 1098 subscribers
[4:41:26] balletbunny: !subgoal
[4:41:27] Fossabot: If we get to 1200 subs on his main we'll have a day of chat-chosen champs in league...on a smurf.
[4:41:39] hoshiNstar: What champ do we want to see
[4:41:40] AwesomeTree: @lil__soupy the amount of times ive had my adc abandon my lane while playing supp in quickplay
[4:41:41] taytayabby: 102 away
[4:41:42] vsmilotic: grave jungle
[4:41:51] VengfulDark: No Yuumi, in general since it wouldn't be the best content after like game 3
[4:42:08] AwesomeTree: i want to see yuumi yes
[4:42:18] lil__soupy: @lil__soupy i'm saying support going to top at the very beginning
[4:42:26] lil__soupy: @lil__soupy and staying their
[4:42:26] VengfulDark: Graves Jungle would be kinda cool
[4:42:30] SyntheeR: Suggestion: to give people a chance to pick something less popular - maybe consider setting up a raffle system (where people type a keyword, you pick a winner, and winner picks champion)
[4:42:58] toytrainsgoburr: not5upWiggle
[4:43:06] VengfulDark: I don't mind any system.
[4:43:12] lil__soupy: i think it would make it fair for everyone it chat, so i would be fine with it
[4:43:13] AwesomeTree: i don't know if there's a better system realistically
[4:43:28] toytrainsgoburr: It’d be a bit more fair since some people don’t chat a ton
[4:43:31] AkitaAttribute: Challenge: Win a game on every champ
[4:43:37] hoshiNstar: Different weights based on champ familiarity
[4:43:39] angelarson: yeah i think thats fair tbh
[4:44:03] FrozenLavaReflector: Personnaly I just dont want to see the same champions that day
[4:44:05] FrozenLavaReflector: 167
[4:44:08] VengfulDark: At least.
[4:44:17] FrozenLavaReflector: Whixh you wont
[4:44:20] toytrainsgoburr: 82 hours is easy for you 5upHi
[4:44:25] AkitaAttribute: Smolder top
[4:44:27] balletbunny: i could do that
[4:44:39] RinaVX: Perfect now lock nasus

[4:45:53] padfootly: o no monkaS
[4:46:02] toytrainsgoburr: Just be better 5upGun
[4:46:22] renziboss: !rank
[4:46:22] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond I 26 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[4:46:46] VengfulDark: Assuming a 50% win rate and 30 minute games it's 125 hours and 15 minutes. across 251 games
[4:46:51] jeskieKAT: Pad LUBBERS
[4:47:05] G13ULTRA: they call him “smolder” despite him never doing such. thoughts?
[4:47:06] AkitaAttribute: Grasp?
[4:47:19] balletbunny: Waiting
[4:47:30] VengfulDark: Sounds like a year goal, where someone would go A-Z one champ per day for a year
[4:47:36] DangerZone14: Why is it good to requeue?
[4:47:40] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[4:47:59] Gragnoth: @5up last night I had a game where my jungler picked Lulu... it was a difficult game to win
[4:48:21] AkitaAttribute: I feel like you could make a series "Proving I can win the game on any champ"
[4:48:30] VengfulDark: I have played most champs, so I'm not the best to ask.
[4:48:33] vsmilotic: wow Faker right there
[4:48:37] FrozenLavaReflector: It is interesting
[4:48:40] auraizen: I'd find it interesting
[4:48:59] hoshiNstar: I like seeing the variety
[4:49:06] lil__soupy: i would find it interesting NODDERS
[4:49:09] toytrainsgoburr: Just make 168 accounts, simple really
[4:49:10] Gragnoth: that's a lot of new emails! XD
[4:49:28] FrozenLavaReflector: I guess the way id put it as would be as i get to see hiw other people experiwnce the game
[4:49:31] VengfulDark: Hwei has been super fun.
[4:49:38] Crompy_: or an ironman, where if you lose you cant play the champ anymore and see how high rank you can get
[4:49:45] padfootly: just use my account as an alt
[4:49:47] padfootly: i never play ranked
[4:49:47] FrozenLavaReflector: And the lvl 30 grind is rough
[4:49:51] taytayabby: Pad 5upFlower
[4:49:51] Fossabot: 5upFlower 5upFlower 5upFlower
[4:49:52] AkitaAttribute: Just "borrow" 168 like the other league creators do.
[4:49:59] padfootly: hewwos 5upFlower
[4:50:09] hoshiNstar: Champ bingo would be fun where chat picks 26 Champs and you have to get bingo before moving onto a new roster
[4:50:14] balletbunny: league adding a artist twink champ then a dragon champ was a present to 5up
[4:50:17] hoshiNstar: 25*
[4:50:37] padfootly: modCheck
[4:50:49] AkitaAttribute: Yet for youtube content, getting a lvl30 account to play on is so common

[4:51:00] Gragnoth: Fossabot is always here!
[4:51:01] VengfulDark: Don't worry I'll moderate myself XD

[4:52:49] AkitaAttribute: @VengfulDark 3 buffs ago riot admitted he was over tuned
[4:52:54] Januous: WAIT REALLY
[4:52:55] JustaStoopidDog: end of the year probably
[4:53:22] VengfulDark: I think immobile mages can be overtuned and be perfectly fine for the game.
[4:53:35] canes_vonbergliez: a very pink team
[4:53:36] FrozenLavaReflector: Ludens into horizon
[4:53:57] JustaStoopidDog: hahahaha

[4:55:26] AwesomeTree: perfectly on beat
[4:56:52] Gragnoth: what is going on with Twitch, I am getting ads so often it's making it almost unwatchable lately!
[4:56:57] JustaStoopidDog: 5upWhyWouldYouDoThat
[4:57:27] raimundao03: i am happy boosfer continued to make videos, they slap so hard always
[4:58:57] Joker_GGEZ: some pre morning lobby league?
[4:59:12] VengfulDark: Kasanta is literally under tower, "hey Mid"
[4:59:24] balletbunny: @joker_ggez Erm
[4:59:24] taytayabby: Joker bluekwL
[4:59:29] Joker_GGEZ: hi Tay!!
[4:59:50] VengfulDark: Skarner has a minimap
[4:59:53] Paper_Man: not to mention u're against the strongest champion in meta
[5:00:44] lil__soupy: hi joker 5upWave
[5:00:50] Joker_GGEZ: haiii
[5:01:12] EmmatheRedPanda: Hi Joker!
[5:01:25] Joker_GGEZ: chat how have the games been
[5:01:28] AkitaAttribute: Shield gives big move
[5:01:37] EmmatheRedPanda: ermmm
[5:01:41] Joker_GGEZ: sorry WHAT'S the champ
[5:01:49] VengfulDark: small model, and tiny footsteps
[5:01:56] AkitaAttribute: Nidalee has crazy move speed  for some reason level 1
[5:02:21] VengfulDark: I swear Nidalee walks faster in human form
[5:02:25] BluerBlack: she has better aim Kappa
[5:03:36] UnderworldClay: Why is your game audio muted?
[5:03:47] Joker_GGEZ: taylor swift 1 you 0
[5:04:08] lil__soupy: @UnderworldClay the music is just loader than game audio
[5:04:23] lil__soupy: louder*
[5:04:24] Joker_GGEZ: ye I hear in game audio
[5:04:26] AkitaAttribute: Why is he invading there too
[5:04:31] lil__soupy: wow i really can't type today
[5:04:44] AkitaAttribute: Or I guess trying to 1v3
[5:05:15] VengfulDark: Skarner is literally SO bad that stats websites have insufficient data
[5:06:49] AkitaAttribute: I feel like he could be good if you built tank.  But that needs a top lane income
[5:08:00] edytluveo: oh it's the same shaco from previous games
[5:08:24] EmmatheRedPanda: what's the count down at the top for? (not there rn)
[5:08:28] VengfulDark: I played a few games of Skarner, and he technically has Ult. the rest of his numbers have been so nerfed
[5:08:39] EmmatheRedPanda: yeah that
[5:08:41] EmmatheRedPanda: ohhhh
[5:08:43] EmmatheRedPanda: thank you
[5:08:50] vDaishar: Baron / Dragon
[5:09:16] VoltiTW: @5up Do you have any tips on how to climb out of bronze/Silver?
[5:09:30] Paper_Man: @EmmatheRedPanda dragon at the right, at the left is herald before 20mins, then baron
[5:09:45] vDaishar: nooiiceee
[5:10:01] EmmatheRedPanda: ty!!!
[5:10:20] BluerBlack: get better team
[5:10:23] BluerBlack: LUL
[5:10:50] VengfulDark: Also, get minion gold, from side lanes like 5up just did
[5:11:46] VengfulDark: if there isn't someone there and nothing else going on, side waves give like 300 gold
[5:11:53] Price_of_Fame: this game turned around quick
[5:12:03] VoltiTW: @5up I missed what ya said abou climbing out of bronze/silver, my girlfriend came to talk to me at the same time xd
[5:12:06] vsmilotic: i thought karma is counter Kappa
[5:12:13] Enma_o: the enemy team had so many unfortunate close fights
[5:12:24] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Also keep in mind, there are like 30% of games your team will throw and you can't stop it. Also, like 30% of games you will win because of opponents. It's the other 40% you need to recognize and keep people playing an objective based game to win.
[5:12:31] ShyPxxie: ksante finished frozen heart and u made bot roam game snowballed fast
[5:12:51] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: That middle percent is where you either climb or don't.
[5:12:56] VengfulDark: I have found throwing 1 spell at a time wasn't hard, but doing the entire WE EQ R QQ combo is too much for my fingers
[5:13:19] Joker_GGEZ: @voltitw girlfriend is forever 5up is now

[5:15:39] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @cokopuffz It sucks that he banned your champ, but keep in mind he was going to uselessly feed his brains out anyway so game might have been a wash regardless.

[5:22:27] Anonymous0726: New skarner out yet?
[5:22:28] VengfulDark: Skarner isn't a champ because his early game is nonexistent
[5:22:38] Anonymous0726: Or is it just items?

[5:22:51] BergMeisterYT: just the items make him good
[5:22:55] BergMeisterYT: but yeh his early game is bad
[5:23:04] VengfulDark: they said next year possibly for Skarner
[5:23:28] vDaishar: just a little poke
[5:23:29] BergMeisterYT: I think Shyv is first right?
[5:23:33] Anonymous0726: Ain't no way
[5:23:38] bluekaden: is hwei a late game champ?

[5:24:00] ShyPxxie: karma braum really fighting the good fight
[5:24:17] JustaStoopidDog: skarner is next up
[5:24:22] VengfulDark: Skarner has his model finished, but not announced when it's actually coming out
[5:24:22] FrozenLavaReflector: his level 1 sucks though
[5:24:22] BergMeisterYT: yeh don't remember the pipeline. But me being an old s2 fan, I miss Shyv and want to see the death of AP burst shyv.
[5:24:25] town_owl: @Anonymous0726 I think Shyv got pushed back or something? Skarners definitely next
[5:24:27] JustaStoopidDog: then the vbunny
[5:24:37] EmmatheRedPanda: what are the levels and how many are there
[5:24:38] Anonymous0726: He's definitely supposed to be very soon
[5:25:02] BergMeisterYT: I also want a Cho rework. or at least a VGU
[5:25:28] VengfulDark: they said hopefully by end of year. Cho functions fine, just a VGU for his model
[5:25:33] BergMeisterYT: muh boi needs the Baron treatment
[5:26:01] BergMeisterYT: Yeh I like his kit, maybe a few QOL things
[5:26:09] VengfulDark: I kinda wish they don't touch Cho's abilities because we need to keep a few Silences in the game
[5:27:03] BergMeisterYT: I just wish he wasnt so prone to being a punching bag late game, and could still dodge a few skillshots haha
[5:27:17] ShyPxxie: they prob won't change cho much his kit isnt really outdated maybe small changes, mostly his model looks atrocious
[5:27:24] bluekaden: wooo

[6:24:18] CoyoteTina: @minismile_ I hate teachers like that. My AC certification course in NTi I had a teacher that "nobody's perfect" an wouldn't give 100% in labs even when I did everything correct. I lost my 4.0 GPA bacause of that clas

[6:24:49] AwesomeTree: it's part of studying for the next one to an extent
[6:24:52] BergMeisterYT: it doesn't I didnt even play the game and that pained me
[6:24:58] minismile_: @minismile_ true
[6:24:59] RinaVX: cuz he loses more then he wins
[6:25:04] lil__soupy: my orgo 2 professor made exams where he expected the majority of people would get like 20%
[6:25:05] minismile_: @RinaVX HELP
[6:25:05] 9fierce9: What a dumb game

[6:25:21] lil__soupy: i think getting an a for that class was like an 80%
[6:25:24] Anonymous0726: Apparently the math dept in my school got in trouble for making too hard of a final
[6:25:31] Anonymous0726: A few years ago
[6:25:39] RinaVX: help? @minismile_

[6:25:56] twtrok: let me be honest: I think you were one to make it longer by infinite farming
[6:26:00] BergMeisterYT: like it was painful enough that there was troll ruining the game for everyone. But then the fact that your team STILL almost lost
[6:26:05] Joker_GGEZ: LMAO maybe
[6:26:12] KevitoBarajas: hi safety10Sip how are the smolder games today?
[6:26:14] mlemfloofs: ALIEN SUPERTSAR

[6:26:48] minismile_: @minismile_ omg good job yeah me too im doing great in all my other classses and then like literally failing this one like the problem is in him obviously
[6:26:52] mlemfloofs: unique danse
[6:26:54] BergMeisterYT: Nah it wasnt the farming. He needed to do that to keep his edge because Jhin did no damage and Garen didnt swap into teamfighting after he broke 2 towers and 2 inhibs.
[6:26:55] Joker_GGEZ: graves back to 20 then? :D
[6:27:03] balletbunny: !uptime

[6:27:44] RinaVX: why does smoulder look like a rip off disney character
[6:27:44] Anonymous0726: I'm like 5 years out of practice with calc I but I could still probably help
[6:28:03] FreeXe: I love this song

[7:08:41] 420paul69: won them the game ngl
[7:08:45] 420paul69: or at least that fight
[7:09:09] CoyoteTina: @lavfully Docks hund technically, it's German, means badger  hound
[7:09:57] hum0ka: @coyotetina definitely not docks.
[7:10:15] hum0ka: It's Dacks or dax
[7:10:27] CoyoteTina: @hum0ka It's pronounched like that not spelled
[7:10:44] lavfully: @hum0ka i’m listen to you
[7:10:44] hum0ka: No, I'm German. You don't say docks
[7:10:52] xthe_spacemanx: in English it’s most commonly pronounced docks.
[7:11:02] CoyoteTina: @hum0ka I speak German, its more of an aaa sound over a hard A

[7:12:06] Confidor: Getting smurfed on
[7:12:46] xthe_spacemanx: can we all just agree on wiener dog?
[7:13:02] hum0ka: And the commonly used name is Dackel in Germany

[7:16:49] ZombiesAreDead10: from u xD
[7:16:54] FrozenLavaReflector: his late game is broken... getting there is another story
[7:16:55] xthe_spacemanx: he is only broken when you steamroll the enemy team
[7:16:59] 420paul69: every game goes to 40 minutes so he scales infinite
[7:17:02] xthe_spacemanx: otherwise he’s pretty balanced
[7:17:03] C_DEZZ: does rfc buff his q range
[7:17:08] xthe_spacemanx: or late game
[7:17:09] skeeld: yea but like ashe does the same no?
[7:17:14] vDaishar: OP > 225 > Meh
[7:17:17] skeeld: in that scenario
[7:17:34] ZombiesAreDead10: if the game goes even you will win no matter what i feel
[7:17:38] Pyronorm: Free Collector and True Damage Liandry's
[7:17:38] C_DEZZ: ashe w that has perma elder buff
[7:17:44] xthe_spacemanx: I think at worst they need to up the number of stacks to like 300
[7:17:51] xthe_spacemanx: for his final upgrade
[7:17:53] 420paul69: balance
[7:18:04] Swifyz: sounds like it needs a buff
[7:18:10] vDaishar: Tbh you have to work to get to 225
[7:18:26] chrisss243: is he better on mid lane or adc?
[7:18:27] twtrok: should add slow to it fr
[7:18:31] Swifyz: I really will never understand league and refuse to play it
[7:18:42] xthe_spacemanx: after 125 it’s like 3 mins to 225
[7:18:45] C_DEZZ: craziest game was me playin him mid into malz i had 225 stacks at like 19 mins
[7:18:46] vDaishar: @Swifyz Smartest choice
[7:18:49] kidvoet: no he isnt wrong
[7:19:01] kidvoet: seeing all abilities go off completely fries ur brain
[7:19:02] Swifyz: Just from what friends have said alone I dont think I need to understand

[7:19:27] C_DEZZ: roughest one ive had mid was into yasuo
[7:19:37] twtrok: this guy keeps saying that it is like tower defense. when it has literally nothing to do with tower defense
[7:19:46] chrisss243: i feel like orianna is a pretty tough match up
[7:19:48] Mira369: Mira369 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months!

[7:30:54] auraizen: might be wrong but on opgg i think it counts by the amount of games youve played as him above d2
[7:30:58] xthe_spacemanx: you are at 61%
[7:31:02] iauja: u have a 61% win rate as smolder
[7:31:08] balletbunny: not number 1? not my streamer SMH
[7:31:21] vDaishar: You have tied for 2nd on games played and highest WR from what I can see
[7:31:37] xthe_spacemanx: coulda been streamer of the year but alas he was simply #2 smolder

[8:08:37] CoyoteTina: @PoteetLee thinkin about the automod thing, Being in Jonas' chat with him playing Palworld.. we've had to allow some really weird words if you look at them out of context
[8:08:54] VVIZRRD: Bullying Akali. Nice.
[8:09:11] CoyoteTina: @PoteetLee oh yeah!! We have a whole town called Frankenmeuth that's basically a little German town in MI. Kinda cool
[8:09:12] PoteetLee: CoyoteTina, I'm sure. I've seen some weird ones. I just like to tease 5up all the time (he's the one who allowed that one).
[8:09:51] CoyoteTina: @PoteetLee haha. yeah atuomod is nice but sometimes it catches some like why did it do that?

[8:42:09] VVIZRRD: Infinite A Sol stacks are OP.
[8:42:15] Turkeyx: Asol stacks lol
[8:42:16] pandalisk9: i think senna more op due to the auto spacing she gets from range?
[8:42:24] XortedI: unlimited smolder stacks is execute from 100%
[8:42:41] Jules_vdc: hitting champs from your own fountain as senna :)
[8:42:49] pandalisk9: in a teamfight, i think smolder wins cuz he just auto kills her team?

[9:21:33] jeskieKAT: NODDERS
[9:21:36] Turkeyx: Wait d ring start?
[9:21:37] plen13: Could do 5v5 viewer games
[9:21:42] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Yeah it pigeon holes you or the other streamer often
[9:21:51] coolwaveofcalm: What 3 champs are we picking for 5up to play today though? Since I think about 60 subs were gifted together
[9:21:55] VVIZRRD: Woo, free stacks!
[9:21:55] XortedI: +2
[9:21:58] Joker_GGEZ: chat makes an emote stream and then it gets added to the channel
[9:22:11] hoshiNstar: What about master yi for champ select
[9:22:11] coolwaveofcalm: There were a lot of subs gifted
[9:22:13] AwesomeTree: yuumi yuumi yuumi
[9:22:14] Anonymous0726: We should play league for mod day frfr

[9:22:29] coolwaveofcalm: Choo Chooo PridePog
[9:22:30] Lau_340: better idea 5up makes a new emote
[9:22:31] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Choo Chooo RPGAyaya
[9:22:42] SyntheeR: Choo Chooo PridePog
[9:22:59] coolwaveofcalm: So Yummi and who else?
[9:23:09] SyntheeR: 3rd Pride emote unlocked, me like
[9:23:19] AwesomeTree: ok i have to go to sleep, but my vote goes to yuumi, ill watch the vod after work tomorrow to see what gets decided 5upL
[9:23:22] coolwaveofcalm: I personally would love to see 5up play Vi but that's just me
[9:23:30] hoshiNstar: Could we do a poll and one of the mods adds the names in chat?
[9:23:43] 9fierce9: Yuumi Gwen PauseChamp
[9:23:44] pureiinsanity: ^
[9:23:46] toytrainsgoburr: Trundle, Alistar, or wukong potentially since he’s never played them before
[9:23:48] coolwaveofcalm: ^^^^
[9:23:50] BluerBlack: 5up do we have to choose 2 champs to play?
[9:23:59] Turkeyx: Asol game? 🥺
[9:24:15] XortedI: I would like a jayce game
[9:24:16] BluerBlack: Warwick
[9:24:17] pureiinsanity: @Turkeyx there was one earlier today
[9:24:20] Loenine: 5up, I'm a new streamer, and I was wondering if I could get some tips on streaming without showing camera
[9:24:31] coolwaveofcalm: Those who gifted the subs I think get to choose, but we can all choose together
[9:24:31] VVIZRRD: Azir?
[9:24:43] Joker_GGEZ: i cant speak for anyone else but i gifted to tilt the hell out of chat
[9:24:50] Joker_GGEZ: so ill let the others decide =)
[9:25:07] kitty_moo_moo: @coolwaveofcalm What do you stream?
[9:25:12] BluerBlack: I think mods should take the "funniest" champs they think for you and do poll
[9:25:18] Anonymous0726: I am surprised by that too
[9:25:35] pureiinsanity: Is 5up good at Seraphine?
[9:25:37] coolwaveofcalm: @kitty_moo_moo I don't stream
[9:25:38] plen13: I just gifted for fun, I don't really care about choosing a champ.
[9:25:50] FrozenLavaReflector: yone be yoneing
[9:25:54] FrozenLavaReflector: fuck that champ
[9:25:55] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Make him play twisted treeline, shame its not possible.
[9:25:57] hoshiNstar: ^ I think poll for Champs is the fairest option
[9:26:03] kitty_moo_moo: @coolwaveofcalm sorry repled to the wrong person lol
[9:26:09] Loenine: Thank you ❤️
[9:26:21] coolwaveofcalm: AwesomeTree wanted Yummi I thikn
[9:26:30] coolwaveofcalm: @kitty_moo_moo oh no worries lol
[9:26:48] plen13: @hoshiNstar Ehh, it'd be hard to choose the options, maybe the people who gifted each get a submission to the poll then everyone votes on that?
[9:27:01] Anonymous0726: Fair hitbox
[9:27:03] kitty_moo_moo: @Loenine same here and i have no one to talk to in my chat but playing goose goose duck with others passed my time for 7 hours years
[9:27:10] Anonymous0726: He is
[9:27:32] kitty_moo_moo: yesterday not years lmao
[9:27:41] hoshiNstar: @plen13 good idea
[9:27:59] coolwaveofcalm: ^^
[9:28:21] Loenine: What about advertising? How do I get people to notice me?
[9:28:32] solomonlear: Honestly, I generally am more interested in the commentary than the face.
[9:28:40] Loenine: Sry if I'm being annoying
[9:28:44] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: I remember when Gosu revealed his voice and his viewership dropped like a rock that he had to rebuild.
[9:29:05] solomonlear: I often am not even watching the stream, I listen to these while working spreadsheets in my office.
[9:29:19] BluerBlack: Or drama
[9:29:32] BluerBlack: There is no such thing as bad popularity Kappa
[9:29:35] Joker_GGEZ: ahhhh i love the sub counter on screen rn
[9:29:38] Joker_GGEZ: feels good :)
[9:29:56] XortedI: that do be yone
[9:30:01] Anonymous0726: Yone is such bullshit
[9:30:06] plen13: @5up Vamp scepter helps in this matchup a bit
[9:30:14] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: It depends on what you want from streaming. Some people are happy just catering to their own niche of people. Like PZ
[9:30:16] Anonymous0726: He needed to be nerfed 10 patches so
[9:30:21] kitty_moo_moo: @Loenine You can always get noticed also just but having fun in streams in the chat just being entertaining
[9:30:48] plen13: 22s level 1
[9:30:51] FrozenLavaReflector: cooldown on what ability?
[9:30:52] lazyxbum: his ulti is pretty short
[9:31:17] plen13: So 16 seconds at level 3
[9:31:18] FrozenLavaReflector: 19 rn
[9:31:26] Th4V7: 22-10 (-3 seconds per point)
[9:31:29] kitty_moo_moo: I love this music choice
[9:31:30] FrozenLavaReflector: 22-10 for e, -3 seconds per rank
[9:31:39] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[9:32:08] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: But you do need to realize it make look easy, but streaming does take work and dedication.
[9:32:15] Turkeyx: Is brand trolling wat
[9:32:17] Anonymous0726: What was he doing
[9:32:23] XortedI: that brand was wierd
[9:32:27] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: it may look easy*
[9:33:30] Anonymous0726: True
[9:33:34] plen13: I mean, streaming is like any field, it takes a lot of work, connections, and a little bit of luck.
[9:34:00] Anonymous0726: Lol
[9:34:03] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Yeah if you don't have connections then its a lot of luck
[9:34:05] Loenine: I kiss as just wondering cause I'm gonna be streaming in around 20 minutes
[9:34:14] Loenine: I was*
[9:34:28] plen13: a TON of luck can make up for the other categories for a bit
[9:34:47] Loenine: But thank you
[9:34:50] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Just a heads up, most streamers do not take kindly to advertising yourself in their streams without permission first.
[9:35:03] Loenine: I wasn't trying to..sry
[9:35:04] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[9:35:37] jeskieKAT: NODDERS 󠀀
[9:35:44] Anonymous0726: !count cannon +1
[9:35:44] Fossabot: @Anonymous0726 Updated 'cannon' count to 9
[9:36:01] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Lots or people are doing well with shorts
[9:36:23] plen13: @Loenine Also make sure you raid people playing the same game with a somewhat similar number of viewers.
[9:36:33] jeskieKAT: AlienDance
[9:36:43] VVIZRRD: Yeah, Brand is rude.
[9:36:45] Loenine: Okay, thank you
[9:36:46] 9fierce9: Perma 3 top
[9:36:50] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Smolder was burned to cinders by brand
[9:36:55] 9fierce9: clown fiesta
[9:37:09] Loenine: I'm sorry for the advertisement thing...I really wasn't trying to .
[9:37:09] lazyxbum: brand = 2nd sup
[9:37:22] hivemindguy: I think smolder is just too weak of a champ to be viable
[9:37:44] kitty_moo_moo: @Loenine im pretty sure 5up is happy to give advice
[9:37:44] lazyxbum: if they nerf is passive burn i would be happy
[9:37:54] 9fierce9: Not a Champ problem, its a matchup problem
[9:38:07] kitty_moo_moo: You guys are being a little too harsh
[9:38:57] hivemindguy: He is too weak and has no health
[9:39:01] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: No ones bashing him, just giving a heads up to watch out for it.
[9:39:39] Loenine: How much longer are you gonna be streaming?
[9:39:48] kitty_moo_moo: @Azrael_Of_The_Lost why get upset for 5up when he isnt upset?
[9:39:50] plen13: @kitty_moo_moo I don't think anyone said anything rude to them, just a gentle reminder that it's "Generally" not accepted. Plus what they were doing 'could' be construed as advertising.
[9:39:52] coolwaveofcalm: So did we decide which champs to make 5up play? Yummi and Vi?
[9:39:53] lazyxbum: his abilities barely has any animation to it so he can just cast and walk away
[9:40:11] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: @kitty_moo_moo no one is upset????
[9:40:22] auraizen: @coolwaveofcalm i think poll? but those sound fun
[9:40:26] kitty_moo_moo: @plen13 i fully understand that but 5up can speak for his self chat
[9:41:04] plen13: Nono, @kitty_moo_moo We weren't speaking for 5up. We were warning them of other chats, that might react poorly to this.
[9:41:07] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: The community is trying to give helpful advice, not just leaving it to the streamer.
[9:41:12] balletbunny: danse
[9:41:30] jeskieKAT: NODDERS
[9:41:31] vDaishar: Tis all good
[9:41:32] jeskieKAT: danse
[9:41:45] coolwaveofcalm: That's a good idea
[9:41:49] Loenine: Sry i gtg, see you later 5up.
[9:41:59] kitty_moo_moo: Im going to leave this alone because lol
[9:42:11] lazyxbum: warded?
[9:42:12] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: yeah.
[9:42:53] vashytalaty29: what makes smolder good. honestly, i don’t see much significance is smolder but I also don’t play much league.
[9:43:11] vDaishar: 33 more stacks
[9:43:14] kitty_moo_moo: @Azrael_Of_The_Lost sweetie you are being helpfully toxic
[9:43:28] kitty_moo_moo: @Azrael_Of_The_Lost thats the issue here
[9:43:38] plen13: @vashytalaty29 He scales infinitely and eventually gets a free elder drake buff
[9:43:51] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: last piece of advice i can think of, is coming up with some kind of memorable mascot. like 5ups turnip boy. Makes being recognized infinitely easier.
[9:44:01] kitty_moo_moo: im going to go so i dont add on to it
[9:44:04] vashytalaty29: @plen13 ohh so he’s really late game?
[9:44:09] zinzanish: 5upDance
[9:44:23] TeaQLive: @kitty_moo_moo ????
[9:44:38] plen13: @Azrael_Of_The_Lost @vashytalaty29 Yes, he spikes around 25 minutes
[9:45:05] vashytalaty29: @plen13 ok thx
[9:45:08] auraizen: @azrael_of_the_lost imo you were completely fine and genuinely just helpful
[9:45:23] notabotiswearnoreally: Cho gath
[9:45:24] 9fierce9: I believe one is yuumi
[9:45:40] Cobiah_: K'Sante
[9:45:41] 9fierce9: The other idk if we got a decision
[9:45:51] coolwaveofcalm: We were thinking of having those who gifted subs submit suggestions and then having chat vote on those suggestions
[9:45:57] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: @auraizen thank you kindly.
[9:46:00] coolwaveofcalm: One for sure is Yummi though
[9:46:02] vDaishar: The damage has arrived
[9:46:37] plen13: @coolwaveofcalm Who would you submit?
[9:46:48] jeskieKAT: modCheck
[9:46:48] coolwaveofcalm: @plen13 Vi
[9:46:51] plen13: Cause I believe Joker and I don't really care who gets played
[9:47:06] plen13: So we could just do Yuumi/Vi/Chat poll?
[9:47:14] coolwaveofcalm: AwesomeTree wanted Yummi and I suggested Vi
[9:47:14] hoshiNstar: I'd like Diana
[9:47:14] ewwii_damncat: imd love to see you play naafiri again personally
[9:47:20] ewwii_damncat: i’d*
[9:47:20] Joker_GGEZ: ye idrc
[9:47:22] Th4V7: does rfc work with q range on smolder?
[9:47:32] vDaishar: yes
[9:48:12] Anonymous0726: Brand ryleis?
[9:48:17] vDaishar: You were melting them too
[9:48:23] vDaishar: nt
[9:48:24] plen13: @Azrael_Of_The_Lost I think I made it obvious, but I don't think you came off as toxic in the slightest, Idk what they were going on about.
[9:48:32] Fossabot: @BluerBlack, Please ask for permission to post a link. [warning]
[9:48:35] vashytalaty29: man that’s our team imo
[9:49:04] Skrunken: @5up have you tried building smolder just really tanky? like you did with doggo? or is smolder much more item deppendant?
[9:49:25] lazyxbum: looks like he was mid
[9:49:31] plen13: Tanky smolder is okay... But he struggles until 225 stacks
[9:49:35] lazyxbum: jug fill
[9:49:46] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: @plen13 yeah no worries, thank you.
[9:50:04] jeskieKAT: NODDERS
[9:50:08] ewwii_damncat: naafiri 5upL
[9:50:08] TeaQLive: poll?
[9:50:10] 9fierce9: Lets just say Yuumi Vi
[9:50:22] 9fierce9: Since cool wave wants Vi
[9:50:25] plen13: @5up That was by the people who gifted
[9:50:29] 9fierce9: And the rest dont care I think
[9:50:33] coolwaveofcalm: Yummi for sure since that's what AwesomeTree wanted
[9:50:41] coolwaveofcalm: I suggested Vi
[9:50:43] plen13: Joker and I don't care, Cool want's Vi, AwesomeTree wants Yuumi
[9:50:45] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: yeah those are good choices
[9:50:47] TeaQLive: yaayyy
[9:50:50] jeskieKAT: peepoCheer
[9:50:52] Anonymous0726: Yuumi Vi seems reasonable
[9:50:55] balletbunny: thanks for the stream!
[9:51:04] balletbunny: peepoBye
[9:51:13] ewwii_damncat: byebye 5up 5upWave
[9:51:14] coolwaveofcalm: Bye 5up!!
