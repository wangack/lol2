I’d leave too if I got the jaw but he didn’t shut up about how easy it was to get and how the basilisks need a buff (he’s never going back so it won’t even effect him, just hurts others). So him and his thousands of viewers start spamming all these... Kapp

[3:47:33] winterdog_: came back from a hoop sesh and saw that i won the doubt LUL
[3:47:35] Kevintaku: got the malphite killed Smadge
[3:47:36] omeN_toN: why did he let yougo
[3:47:38] WizzyHatG: why did zac let you live wtf
[3:47:40] Arcaddia_: who would've guessed ganking a tank top at level 3 would be a bad idea
[3:47:41] Stew: he had vest already
[3:47:45] WizzyHatG: zac paid actor
[3:47:45] klatterbox: malphite gonna report you KEKW
[3:47:47] DvDPlayerDuder: could have killed him if ignored the camp i reckon
[3:47:48] nutcrackerr: as a jungle main I was like come on bro this is ur chance, you had to give up that camp for the opening and not use ur E on the camp too
[3:47:49] datfatasss: jg diff huge
[3:47:58] Ramrod_Johnson: That was hand in hand bad play
[3:48:13] datfatasss: typical jg can’t leave camp for free kill
[3:48:16] klatterbox: Malphite doesn’t do anything
[3:48:16] nutcrackerr: that was kind of your fault to greed for the camp instead of take the opening for a dive sooner
[3:48:16] Pathyul: FirstTimeJoeler
[3:48:27] Oh_SymboL: FirstTimeChadder
[3:48:41] austwee: free kill lol that ornn was never going to die
[3:48:47] WizzyHatG: No jury would convict malphite for going 0/10 after that ngl
[3:48:58] shambaz: Surely
[3:49:16] nutcrackerr: @austwee He was if he just e'd ornn out of the bush and ran in with q w this ornn  was free af, it was just a play on a timer and he didnt respect the timer
[3:49:17] klatterbox: Jury rules in malphite’s favour
[3:49:30] nutcrackerr: @austwee but he decided to finish the camp so then it was too late
[3:49:58] austwee: @nutcrackerr nah ornn just tanks it and we die to turret or waste flash
[3:50:10] nutcrackerr: some plays are just on a timer and u gotta decide do I make this play or kill this camp, if u kill the camp , you don't afterwards still do the play
[3:50:19] deadmanchef: justified if he ran it
[3:50:35] nutcrackerr: @austwee sorry bro that's just not true, lillia easily had the dmg to kill him in one rotation
