[0:05:59] Zady: VoHiYo
[0:06:08] DeathWaffle: We love tierlists LUL
[0:07:11] Grumpmeister: At least EUNE is managable from EUW Kappa
[0:07:41] DeathWaffle: @Santorin When you play jungle, do you pick and fill spots or do you just play what you like?
[0:07:57] Grumpmeister: Yeah, kinda same. Had Nordic friends, so started on EUNE in S2
[0:08:20] Zady: you've been playing it for a while now- how is the new match-making system compared to the old one? does it feel markedly better?
[0:08:30] Rasree: it think all danes started eune and quite quickly swapped to euw Pepega
[0:09:13] DeathWaffle: Ahhh ok. I end up picking zach when we need a thank LUL
[0:09:43] Zady: That's unfortunate. I was hoping for something to feel atleast slightly better
[0:10:04] Grumpmeister: I'd expect a team comp like that in Bronze, but man... It truly is the same in all MMRs LUL
[0:10:31] Frozenfruit13: fiora ADC YUPPP

[2:29:15] whogivesashtt: when playing league just dont try to understand people.
[2:29:24] whogivesashtt: it will never make sense
[2:29:31] Darkvudoo: jungle is a thankless role in league it sucks but as is the life of a jungle
[2:29:39] zokeoh: @Alveneb yea I agree but generally thats probably good for keeping people playing and addicted
[2:30:09] JWM102: reassuring to know you could literally become a seasoned pro and people would still flame you as jg, makes me feel better lol

[2:40:00] Haste: i find this season really hard with losing solo lanes, feels like botlane has no agency and going for bot pressure is a waste
[2:40:12] noscreenkaladin: bg
[2:40:16] Haste: even in games where i perma sit bot and adc is 5-1 it feels unwinnable
[2:40:19] crecentbear: @Haste IT'S INSANE, one hard losing lane and game becomes unplayable
[2:40:45] Haste: @crecentbear Since like S5/S6 when they made the game way more teamplay focused it has felt like the worst player in the lobby always loses game instead of best player in lobby wins game
[2:40:45] jarmsZ: all you can do is gank the shen so he can’t use ult but if he can 1v2 you screwed
[2:40:51] Smegnite: Comp diff honestly

[4:25:44] Offsette7: jg gap
[4:27:12] Falcnation: i think he means where it will just use it at max range instead of moving the champ in range to do so
[4:27:12] TheDiison: Like casts at max vs walks the champ to where you placed it when you're too far with your cursor
[4:27:18] Iamaf33d3r: did you see that hook busio had yesterday @Santorin
[4:27:25] Iamaf33d3r: around the turret

[4:30:52] binultwitch: yea i personally refuse to play brand but im getting my ass kicked by them haha
[4:31:04] Falcnation: smolder is a scaling champ and riot made him scale hella late
