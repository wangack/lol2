[0:55:00] ieatthemforaliving: HELLOOO.
[0:55:00] jimbob_ywert: @definitelynotjohnnyp Oh yes I play Annie one shotting is ALWAYS fun, I think I meant in the sense that she has low skill floor which makes it less interesting to pick her up since many want a champ they can master and be rewarded for
[0:55:04] WWClown: galio takes 0 dmg

[1:07:44] ZYRDKING: @UTONT12345 Ahri could only be useless if she does 0 damage, she has too much outplay potential.

[1:14:27] ferriswheel8: @TwitchbyRay i think it's also to prevent like being absolutely stuck in a rank like gold since plat is basically easier to get into now

[1:51:15] ObsceneSanity: smolder seems mediocre bc games dont go to 30 very often. but if they do smolder crushes the late game

[2:01:02] ferriswheel8: @FeedTheTank True, a good rell player can provide an amazing amount of cc in a teamfight
[2:01:30] FeedTheTank: @ferriswheel8 but if the players sucks, it doesn't matter how much c she provides
[2:01:57] fluffycloudlove: riot nerfed Oriana why?!?! kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti kaypHUH
[2:02:27] petaa16: @fluffycloudlove lets be real she was too strong
[2:02:34] ferriswheel8: @FeedTheTank Yeah thats also true, ive seen many (including me) rell players that saw an opportunity to engage and took it without thinking of the consequences kaypLOL
[2:02:58] fluffycloudlove: @petaa16 I guess just sad panda about the news
[2:03:13] theenation97: I think they nerfed her HP like a month or so ago
[2:03:13] reallycreativ: @fluffycloudlove ori and syndra were in every game LUL
[2:03:20] FeedTheTank: @ferriswheel8 yea, that's why i prefer to have a jgl premade when playing, as it makes it easier to coordinate the engages
[2:03:36] ferriswheel8: @fluffycloudlove Dw, she's still strong, the punishment she offers in the lane is truly insane

[2:10:39] ferriswheel8: @mrry2k Lmaoo fr
[2:10:41] jimbob_ywert: Just went 19/3 on Zoe, beating a 0/9 vlad in lane. what’s insane is that he literally solo’d me while being 2 levels down, 0/7 at the time, and he had no sums.
[2:11:22] FeedTheTank: @jimbob_ywert that's vlad in season 14 for you xD
[2:11:24] reallycreativ: What does sylas mean "Ori won't move"
[2:11:25] S17Master: @jimbob_ywert If you tell me you had Orb, I'll be really depressed to read that
[2:11:26] reallycreativ: Lol
[2:11:29] ferriswheel8: @jimbob_ywert Yeah vlad these days is a menace, ive seen a tiktok of a guy that solo killed a malphite and survived like 10 turret shots, and still came out of the fight with half his hp
[2:12:03] egirl_7: @jimbob_ywert are you girl?
[2:12:05] FeedTheTank: @KayPea ludens 2nd items is not a bad idea
[2:12:07] torge_154: Idk if you ever played Ekko in Season 13 or 14. But he’s disgusting. I am maining him and it doesn‘t matter if early isn’t good, you‘re broken anyways! kaypFreya
[2:12:14] neewbluee: 0 demage Smolder LOL
[2:12:27] ferriswheel8: I literally hate viego so much, the range, the dashes and the invisibility compared with the damage he deals is INSANE
[2:12:28] jimbob_ywert: @s17master I did 😭
[2:12:29] iMadCuzBad: Was that his auto? :o
[2:12:38] ericaborgest: is stormsurge not good for ori's ult?
[2:12:44] Niomah: Dear Riot. As a fed Orianna in ARAM, with 40 Flat + 40% magic Pen + Malignance, the fact I cannot even scratch a Rammus with 2 MR items with my ULT is a pretty good indicator you need to nerf the MR items. Kthx.
[2:12:47] goliat_gamee: hiii! How the games are going?
[2:12:56] ObsceneSanity: @ericaborgest shes not hitting the proc threshold
[2:13:00] ObsceneSanity: not yet
[2:13:03] jimbob_ywert: @ferriswheel8 That’s disgusting lol,  is vlad even considered a mage?
[2:13:19] jimbob_ywert: @egirl_7 no
[2:13:30] ferriswheel8: @jimbob_ywert He most definitely is, although making him a fighter would be more logical at this point
[2:13:41] torge_154: WTF?!
[2:13:42] darjar12: unfortunate
[2:13:42] ObsceneSanity: profane?
[2:13:42] ericaborgest: crocodile broken
[2:13:43] ajak636: smolder waited too long
[2:13:47] Niomah: I just lost an aram where we should have won, we were all fed, we had a Leona. Alistar, Rammus, and Xin each built two MR items and I couldn't do any damage to them despite having every Mag pen item
[2:13:49] theenation97: lol smolder immediately dying
[2:14:01] torge_154: I guess Croco is broken kaypLeave
[2:14:22] FeedTheTank: @ferriswheel8 he was always broken, but the new items make hm even more so, and not long ago he was buffed, so by far an s tier champ
[2:14:24] mewythegremlin: fiora full burn ou t xd
[2:14:37] ferriswheel8: @Niomah Yeah that's insane, im so sorry for that
[2:14:39] jimbob_ywert: That senna skin is so pretty
[2:14:41] JudgeSteven: He forced the fight LUL
[2:14:44] mrry2k: fiora almost did dmg to him there she'll get him eventually !
[2:14:48] goliat_gamee: and he started fighting on his meele range too
[2:14:51] Jaguar542: Wait an Orianna game
[2:14:55] GGSpano: GGSpano subscribed with Prime. 
[2:14:58] ferriswheel8: @FeedTheTank 😭😭😭
[2:15:01] jimbob_ywert: @ferriswheel8 definitely one of the more disgusting mages
[2:15:18] torge_154: @jaguar542 I know kaypFlower
[2:15:48] torge_154: the f***
[2:15:52] shamneo: range n has an area too
[2:15:53] Sharko_xD: He took no damage from your R
[2:15:56] FeedTheTank: @ferriswheel8 but as he has a high skill ceiling, it takes alot to be good with him xD
[2:15:59] erennycell: Good luck hf KayPea
[2:16:04] Jaguar542: Spyro accatck!
[2:16:07] fletchq: this the same smolder telling u not to figh
[2:16:08] ajak636: a smolder flanking? lol
[2:16:14] goliat_gamee: this smolder really thinks his champ is a fighter hahaha
[2:16:17] IAmKat95: im unsure what smolder is doing..
[2:16:18] Pigaas: is this emerald fiesta?
[2:16:30] mewythegremlin: sylas being real happy rn i could feel it, the way he jumped out of the bush strraight onto you hahah
[2:16:31] torge_154: Okay, i take everything back I said about Ori. She‘s terrible kaypShame
[2:16:33] iMadCuzBad: :-)
[2:16:34] nekomafk: figth
[2:16:36] Ezkhel: Kappa
[2:16:42] eggramsey: me everytime
[2:16:49] reallycreativ: Boy Kappa
[2:16:59] Niomah: Ori needs a massive buff. The MR items just delete her damage
[2:17:00] IAmKat95: Smolder needs to focus on scaling with his Q and fight as a team...
[2:17:13] goliat_gamee: it should be like when new chemp is relesed he is banned from rank for 2 weeks or something ahha
[2:17:20] shamneo: this banger of a song
[2:17:27] torge_154: ye You’re right. But she scales really well kaypAyyy
[2:17:30] theenation97: limit testing?
[2:17:31] jimbob_ywert: Ori is really really good in promplay because she’s required to be played mechanically and more macro focused
[2:17:32] IAmKat95: i think he gets his last upgrade on the Q at 250 stacks?? I dont remember
[2:17:34] ferriswheel8: @Niomah I mean so do most mages nowadays, it's an item problem, not a champion problem i think
[2:17:49] IAmKat95: but yeah, mans too squishy to keep just going in lol
[2:17:52] iMadCuzBad: Ori is 0 early, mid she can do a little then late she rules the fights
[2:17:56] Niomah: @jimbob_ywert In pro play she's also accompanied by a team that is built around her ult generally
[2:17:59] IAmKat95: typical adc player lmao (I'm an adc player LUL )
[2:18:01] idckdolphins: Hey there KP!
[2:18:22] Niomah: But if an enemy tank or bruiser has literally 2 MR items now, she does very little other than the cc
[2:18:23] idckdolphins: I've been on a 10 games lose streak. Feels great xD
[2:18:23] S17Master: Rough game
[2:18:38] Niomah: I've lost 7 of my last 9 @idckdolphins , I feel ya
[2:18:38] IAmKat95: any game with a Sylas is rough.. urghhh
[2:18:44] jimbob_ywert: @niomah definitely yes the cooperation is much higher in pro play
[2:18:46] ObsceneSanity: first time seeing an ori this season so idk what you're supposed to do
[2:18:49] Shaicy: Who is KayPea my friends ask me all the time, I tell them to some she's a hero to others a villian but to me she's perfect
[2:18:58] shamneo: helps with ult cooldown n if multiple enemies gets ulted, could be good
[2:19:04] torge_154: you should mute Fiora too. She‘s not really playing. She‘s writing in the Chat and thinks she can reaches smth kaypCreep
[2:19:04] Jaguar542: I feel not going Shadow flame 2nd item is just trolling hard
[2:19:40] ericaborgest: get ludens then void maybe?
[2:19:47] idckdolphins: @Niomah It's a nightmare, doesn't matter if I win lane or int. I main teemo, this lil guy after the nerfs fall so hard behind. I've said multiple times - Nerf the items, not the champs.
[2:19:53] jimbob_ywert: what a steal LOL
[2:19:54] Lurkiestmonstr0: Thjat was a nice steal tho
[2:19:55] darjar12: this rell is absolutely amazing
[2:19:56] fletchq: 2 mana items maybe not good idea
[2:19:58] bragismuse_scathach: I don’t see ori a whole lot anymore; maybe they’re all higher up, I’m stuck in silver lol kaypTroll
[2:20:05] iMadCuzBad: steaaaal
[2:20:20] Lurkiestmonstr0: but was the dreag ddive worth the inhiob losds
[2:20:21] ferriswheel8: The amount of heals from this soraka, even though you have an oblivion orb terrifies me
[2:20:22] iMadCuzBad: But they get inhib.. hmm
[2:20:25] ajak636: it feels like the items mages build dont even matter BibleThump
[2:20:36] theenation97: smolder’s bubble thing looks like it should do so much damage
[2:20:36] Darkcyter: @iMadCuzBad @torge_154 @shamneo @jimbob_ywert kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[2:20:41] Niomah: I did Void + Shadowflame + Sorcs + Stormsurge + Malignance and I did nothing to tanks with MR items
[2:20:43] Goriyay: am I the only one whos like hella over baron? It just feels too strong idk
[2:20:54] torge_154: Sylas Can’t do anything with your Ult. It feel like he doesn‘t know how the R is working kaypLOL
[2:21:02] jimbob_ywert: Baron is the most important objective tbh
[2:21:02] Darkcyter: @theenation97 @Niomah @Goriyay kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[2:21:09] torge_154: *feels
[2:21:11] ObsceneSanity: @Goriyay thats the point though
[2:21:12] FeedTheTank: @KayPea cryptbloom might be good too, as it heals on ult being used
[2:21:12] Goriyay: @Darkcyter kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[2:21:13] Niomah: Hey @Darkcyter !
[2:21:20] ajak636: like in the past we would go for liandry's versus tanks and now i dont really know what to build
[2:21:21] ShyMarshMellow: Hey kaypea
[2:21:24] jimbob_ywert: @darkcyter Hey dark kaypUpsetti
[2:21:27] ShyMarshMellow: How's the new champ

[2:21:44] Goriyay: @ObsceneSanity ikik like i guess thars why we should be contestin it and stuff
[2:21:50] YiOnSteroids: no dps in team
[2:21:58] ericaborgest: gg
[2:21:59] Jaguar542: They have a bunch of lifesteal and a soraka, burn damage just give them time to heal up again
[2:22:05] darjar12: ggs
[2:22:06] torge_154: @shymarshmellow A lil‘ terrible
[2:22:06] mistermurr: Gg's

[2:22:57] ShyMarshMellow: @torge_154 shame his design is great
[2:23:04] eggramsey: u did well just unfortunate
[2:23:13] Niomah: PLaying this weekend has been exhausting. Matchmaking in ARAM has been cuckoo for coco puffs
[2:24:01] torge_154: @shymarshmellow Ik, i am playing him too. I thought you meant the Smolder in the Game kaypFreya
[2:24:06] ShyMarshMellow: Smolder has a nice design, people just need to get used to him
[2:24:18] darjar12: rough day

[2:24:59] Niomah: I like Smolder, but you have to be super patient playing him and scale.
[2:25:07] kimdj: !eu
[2:25:07] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[2:25:12] ObsceneSanity: i thought thats why you brought your second account over for lol
[2:25:35] Goriyay: what do u usually build on lux? i cant figure a good build out
[2:25:40] Goriyay: figure out a good build*
[2:25:46] Niomah: You also need a support for Smolder that can slow people down so your W can hit
[2:25:54] Niomah: or is it E? The Achoo one
[2:26:01] Jaguar542: had a 6 lose stream this weekend and I felt I could not get to play the game, so that's just great!

[2:38:04] FeedTheTank: @ferriswheel8 i k, i just switch between lich bane and stormsurge as a 3 rd item
[2:38:18] huskyheaven: that top lane looks like a lot of fun LOL tank vs tank
[2:38:20] FeedTheTank: @ferriswheel8 it depends on the math up

[3:40:27] ferriswheel8: @sanemelody Well i think it's just a thing they pointed out, no hate to the actual person, just wanted to share their thoughts?

[3:41:41] ferriswheel8: I would never expect people here to actually hate others, this community is an amazing example of chill and respectful people, and noone here is actually trying to offend people, we are just talking and sharing our thoughts on some things, that's all kaypFlower
