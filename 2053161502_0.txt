[6:35:53] hewhocomz: f???
[6:35:55] SweatySpectre: holy shit
[6:35:59] deepseaAstronomy: @pankeke231 then he'd have to give up teleport which has too much utility
[6:36:00] SweatySpectre: top tier flash from darius
[6:36:03] Komlin111: nope
[6:36:05] emanor18: they always do this
[6:36:06] natansme: most gifted darius player
[6:36:12] Skuba14: but i litteraly remember you hard flaming people who dont take dorans blade vs darius
[6:36:16] garenplayer1010: has a little bit slow
[6:36:25] Pramo: @natansme specifically in early laning I notice that kr and cn aatrox players dont use q3 that often
[6:36:35] elcoconut0: you should listen sagopa kajmer
[6:36:46] Komlin111: @Skuba14 dorans blade used to give omnivamp tho, they chaged it to ls so its way worse
[6:36:50] hewhocomz: u cant blame him for the lash since hes an amputee
[6:36:51] klon_koloredo: huj
[6:37:00] SweatySpectre: @Skuba14 was this before D shield and darius was buffed tho
[6:37:02] natansme: @Pramo I gotta be honest I dont play aatrox but I'm pretty sure the cd is shorter if you only use the first 2 Qs
[6:37:15] Pramo: @natansme yeah that's prolly it I guess
[6:37:23] natansme: @natansme so what I see aatrox players do usually is only use Q1 and 2, and 3 only if they can guarantee the hit
[6:37:24] Komlin111: yeah rank 1 q cd is longer if u use all 3
[6:37:31] deepseaAstronomy: I feel like being able to consistently land Q1 + Q2 every time they're up leads to more damage than a potentially whiffed Q3
[6:37:43] youngcawkx: skarnerlol waiting for rework
[6:38:18] natansme: they usually use E to hit the 2nd Q anyways and you gotta be a complete idiot to get hit by 3rd Q aatrox when he doesnt have E up to hit it

[9:00:11] duoclone7021: @kreatorusss bvut honestly its impossible to balance league to much champs so i kinda stopped playing it i just hop on it once a week maybe
[9:00:15] oafy_loafy_dude: @duoclone7021 it's because this isn't a game, it's a psychological experiment to see how to make people go insane
[9:00:24] ponyrosa_: yasuo is strong against atrox somehow
[9:00:37] parox3tine: because yasuo top is dogwater
[9:00:41] duoclone7021: @oafy_loafy_dude thats why i kind of stopped bro XD
[9:00:50] kreatorusss: @duoclone7021 i mean if they just made a system where it queues 4/5 stack vs other 4/5 stacks not into 2/3 stacks
[9:00:52] rulonmagulon: ye
