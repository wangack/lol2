[1:29:33] itkovian1: Especially fantasy.  There is so much shit fantasy anime.
[1:29:45] wilsonao: The problem with anime isn't so much that there's shit ones, it's that people recommend the shit ones.

[1:30:01] Dragonslave49: yeah they can all be isekais :)
[1:30:05] itkovian1: And thankfully Frieren is good old fashioned non-isekai fantasy

[1:51:33] plen13: I mean, you Q/E when it's not empowered
[1:51:46] wilsonao: Irelia
[1:51:54] plen13: it's just every 6-8 seconds you can cast a 600 damage shield on your whole team.
[1:51:56] plen13: And heal them
[1:52:43] johnsmith37: cabt be bad
[1:53:37] plen13: Cosmic is good, but it's generally after like Redemption/Moonstone or Staff

[2:41:17] SPQR_CAESAR: Maybe its time to go back to your roots? Jungle
[2:41:45] SPQR_CAESAR: Classic
[2:41:46] wilsonao: support is so fun, esp the champs good at it right now
[2:41:48] DeBruce: what skin is that pink one ? weird ass face
[2:42:01] Thadune: @saintvicious You didnt gank enough.. clearly
[2:42:27] wilsonao: when you gank as support everyone is like 'bless this support for roaming"
[2:42:38] wilsonao: when you gank as jungle everyone is like "about fuckign time"
[2:43:24] redviper0: You're usually not playing with randoms in team sports
[2:44:05] redviper0: Yeah you're not playing with randoms in competitive matches
[2:44:12] Slothful_Guy: The anonymity of the Internet
[2:44:16] TheZim: anonymity of the internet also helps
[2:44:19] Jayjajy: If you put money on it you'd probably get shit for missing shots irl
[2:44:40] wilsonao: Video games attract antisocial personalities
[2:44:55] redviper0: Still frustating ig
[2:45:03] Jayjajy: Then again athletes get hate for "underperforming" by people sitting on their asses watching the game on TV
[2:45:05] twtrok: also you usually do not play basketball whole day and night because they do not have anything better to do with theirs life
[2:45:37] redviper0: @twtrok You also don't get trolls lmao
[2:45:40] JesusBatman: Honestly maybe is the skill gap but dude atleast when i tried my hardest
[2:45:45] JesusBatman: some games just felt uncarryable
[2:45:55] JesusBatman: im also a mid tier gold player
[2:47:42] Thadune: @saintvicious Ya only in online games I see this toxicity. In Football we were all about playing for the guy beside us and knowing we were only as a strong as our weakest link. So we would motivate each other.
[2:48:23] wilsonao: that was def time to flash
[2:48:23] redviper0: @Thadune But people are actually trying, even if they suck, if someone started scoring own goals they'd probably get kicked out of the game
[2:49:07] wilsonao: If you started scoring on your own team, you'd legit get the shit beat out of you prob or just never be allowed to play again.
[2:49:18] wilsonao: In League it's like "go play some more buddy!"
[2:50:06] Mbubs: @wilsonao Welcome back :)
[2:50:19] wilsonao: KEKW
[2:51:19] wilsonao: @Mbubs I been doin sneaky stuff

[3:03:29] TheGesterr: bruh

[3:03:29] Hysteriqa: whats up with this racist ass jhin bruh

[3:03:52] Mbubs: So THAT'S why he was saving his Flash
[3:04:11] twtrok: it may be wrong game for sane team
[3:04:11] trentogorgon: go back to the cotton fields will do it
[3:05:05] trentogorgon: someone said that to my gf and he got fired and sued :P
[3:05:11] lion415: I get more feedback reports when I include that the player is not a healthy inclusion to the player experience
[3:06:25] lion415: no
[3:06:43] t0rment1917: i believe
[3:07:12] lion415: jhin and akali are stuck inside their own heads
[3:09:22] trentogorgon: this game embodies teh wholesome league experience we all love and enjoy
[3:15:18] MageOfFry: Hello cozy chat and stream
[3:15:24] MageOfFry: widepeepoHappy
[3:17:57] lion415: remember to leave a nice review of that Jhin
[3:18:06] lion415: nevermind :)
[3:18:09] trentogorgon: xin was useless
[3:18:41] Mbubs: Nice try Saint, the important part is that you stayed positive and wholesome the entire game :)
[3:20:21] lion415: i just like to throw on keinemusik and let spirit play for me
[3:20:33] TheGesterr: Thresh good too
[3:20:43] TheGesterr: but then you have to play Morgana
[3:20:51] johnsmith37: finally a real support morgana
[3:21:28] johnsmith37: i think his maokai and bard games were rough CatBite
[3:21:33] JesusBatman: @saintvicious  Do youu still have that scrappy doo shirt?
[3:22:24] JesusBatman: its def an obscure thing to bring up LOL

[3:46:59] Denyingjoker1: Isn’t league fun.
[3:47:18] ronchohonchoncho: you get the ultimate prize: chat's respect
[3:47:38] ronchohonchoncho: KappaPenis
[3:49:06] trentogorgon: you're known as a jungler. that comes with expectations. you can't control those
[3:50:14] trentogorgon: i remember you played support and coached but your fame is from your jungle role. so folks have that expectation. that's just my take
[3:50:20] vloey: only eat breakfast
[3:50:49] ronchohonchoncho: you were NA's jungle hopium
[3:50:56] trentogorgon: no, its more accurate to say 'why isn't he acting anymore'
[3:50:57] mhezuclears: play kata supp
[3:51:08] trentogorgon: he's knwn as an actor. folks expect him to act
[3:51:11] wilsonao: Mike Myers, why don't you make more Wayne's World movies
[3:51:13] mdiesel394: Yeah he's done a bunch of stuff recently
[3:51:14] trentogorgon: is he? :P
[3:51:34] trentogorgon: well yeah but that's not him
[3:51:48] ronchohonchoncho: I'd watch a new Home Alone with Macauley to be fair
[3:52:02] Hysteriqa: he just had a kid
[3:52:08] trentogorgon: he was in an american horror story series a few years ago
[3:52:11] trentogorgon: but he took a huge break
[3:52:13] wilsonao: He got a smokin wife
[3:52:16] mdiesel394: He was in American Horror story for a season
[3:53:09] trentogorgon: here's the funny thing - you've been a streamer longer than a pro gamer, and you've streamed more TFT than League, but folks will still want you to jungle. that's just how it goes
[3:53:14] mdiesel394: TFT guy is pretty funny
[3:53:37] wilsonao: Soon they will know you as the Aram guy
[3:53:40] ronchohonchoncho: Say the line bart

[3:56:12] IIIStyXLIII: It's that guy that plays games
[3:56:18] wilsonao: The worst part of D4 was that shitty ass KFC sandwich I had to eat to find out the game sucked
[3:56:39] Nikademous: Just say you prefer support....
[3:57:02] johnsmith37: i like support you focus more on the game and less on farming
[3:57:03] IAmTyson: But you were a jungler back then, why would you prefer support!?
[3:57:04] ronchohonchoncho: Sometimes I play as Mario, sometimes Luigi, but mostly Wario HahaThink HahaThink
[3:57:07] IIIStyXLIII: But you used to be a jingler, what happened?
[3:57:11] wilsonao: People always want long explanations
[3:57:27] wilsonao: They'll keep saying "just seems weird that ..."
[3:57:28] Nikademous: But they are asking the question so maybe it's not obvious to everyone
[3:57:36] mdiesel394: maybe they're expecting some story about how you missed smite one too many times and you're too traumatized to jungle anymore idk
[3:57:42] johnsmith37: dude ive been excited to see some gragas gameplay

[4:55:36] FerricNitrate: yeah that's definitely the old layout
[4:55:38] the__nise: no botside hell brush
[4:55:40] Tabriel013: who ever say Maokaj isnt good is R-word in terms of mental capability
[4:55:52] navlsdope: Maokai is broken imo cuz of utility
[4:55:52] DABEATBOX: when they don't know the reason to flame
[4:55:54] redviper0: why is sol mad

[4:56:32] DABEATBOX: i know you since i started
[4:56:40] DABEATBOX: you started*
[4:56:40] LordAudacity: ancient history
[4:56:57] BokuwaBraden: I miss the pro saint days
[4:57:19] DABEATBOX: i am just saying i think mao is not the best to hardcarry maybe i am wrong, you know better probably
[4:57:26] redviper0: hes gonna be dead for a minute his ult doesnt matter
[4:57:39] gearsquared: @DABEATBOX damage =/= hardcarry
[4:57:43] BokuwaBraden: Mao super good to hard carry.  Their team can't beat your team if they can't move
[4:57:45] gearsquared: don't think about it like that
[4:57:49] Onionknight47: people think dps = carrying
[4:57:49] Shimoroku: if everyone is a carry, then no one is a carry
[4:57:53] BokuwaBraden: I HATE a good maokai
[4:57:57] Onionknight47: but carrying a game is all about making good plays idk
[4:58:01] the__nise: impact in a league game has so many faces
[4:58:07] drbeeyotch: Thats why I play Yi as support
[4:58:14] BokuwaBraden: Give me a squishy fed person I can find out of position any day
[4:58:16] avatre218: Keria must be trash then by that logic...
[4:58:19] BurdenOfAtlas: saint is a meta chaser
[4:58:22] IrishProphet: Crowd control is always so broken
[4:58:41] IrishProphet: People overrate deeps and underate cc and mobility
[4:58:41] Dragonslave49: a lot of comps need someone to stand in front it's one of the reasons adcs often underperform (nobody there to peel for them)
[4:58:58] DABEATBOX: makes senese, why do you think it got this high? new items?
[4:59:10] Onionknight47: what got this high?
[4:59:10] BokuwaBraden: Unmissable CC is pretty big
[4:59:21] lolscruffy: speaking of your history in the game, I see you play mostly support now. why did you leave the jungle role?
[4:59:28] BokuwaBraden: I can dodge skillshot CC all day long but if I'm in W range it's over
[4:59:34] gearsquared: @lolscruffy laners xdd
[5:00:10] TheZim: that magic shield item is so strong Pog
