[5:27:10] Arriv003: most adcs are pretty mechanical
[5:27:15] Zaknafeint: Any normal adc would do fine with blitz senna having low attack speed means you cannot kill targets that are hooked
[5:27:15] grrrrit: vayne is hard she has no escpaes and she needs to know how to do things when to do it
[5:27:17] ev3rlasting4: Blitz not actually a baby champ as well... ;d
[5:27:37] dyk_jonathan: you got gapped
[5:27:41] Renfuryy: I dont have a counter argument, ive played a few games as vayne, but its definitely easier to play MF/cait/ long range adcs
