[0:11:44] edengardenz: HUH
[0:11:45] MrHiLighter: thats why i just steal it
[0:11:45] CHOHSAN: Aside from being a garbage company the food and coffee are pretty underwhelming.
[0:11:46] 1TheRedFox: So glad you liked it
[0:11:50] hanselthedoggo: what do u get at the grocery store
[0:11:52] Oreganeaux: Starbucks is not worth the money
[0:11:53] 1TheRedFox: @CHOHSAN shit burnt coffee
[0:11:57] CHOHSAN: Then again I've never gotten like a super custom order. Maybe that makes up for it.
[0:12:03] shintoaliengod: you dont just walk out with your groceries without talking to anyone? Shruge
[0:12:16] dyonnes123: What elo?
[0:12:21] CHOHSAN: @CHOHSAN Wait, is it burnt if all their coffee tastes that way? HahaThink
[0:12:28] Heronian_: @dyonnes123 bronze II
[0:12:32] trunnpet: even their frappes don't really have good coffee in them and are mostly just flavored syrups and a ton of sugar. u can make better at home with a coffee machine and blender
[0:12:40] Shcleepy: @1theredfox I was surprised that it smelt and tasted so much like a mellow red wine, really great with the grapes and crackers PogTasty
[0:12:42] CHOHSAN: I like Coffee Bean and Tea TRee or whatever.
[0:12:45] 1TheRedFox: @CHOHSAN no they like purposefully roast (blitz) the shit out of all their beans
[0:12:53] CHOHSAN: They add just enough coffee to my sugar to make it tasty.
[0:13:04] Oreganeaux: guys, Pekin is a challenger player, obviously he’s joking, he doesn’t go outside.
[0:13:07] Heronian_: starbucks also hates their workers and unions :(
[0:13:09] CHOHSAN: @1TheRedFox why?
[0:13:12] 1TheRedFox: @Shcleepy YEaaaaaaaaaaa. Washed cheese are like awesome (but some  of them can be really funky depending on what they washed the rind with)
[0:13:28] rivernk: Hi chat Hi Pekin
[0:13:32] 1TheRedFox: @CHOHSAN mass quantities
[0:13:36] cr1ppl: yone is so fun. /s
[0:13:36] l_am_not_him: do you think zoe is the most meta champ you play regularly
[0:13:36] PecXeus: why u dont ban yone when u play zoe?
[0:13:47] 1TheRedFox: They burn it at a higher temp because they want to get it all roasted but they use so much in production
[0:13:48] bananomon_: hey yo sup
[0:14:01] nyellobello: hey yo sup mr pekky
[0:14:01] 1TheRedFox: instead of a proper roast, they just blitz the shit out of it all
[0:14:02] Shcleepy: @1theredfox the only other special cheese I've had was a Humboldt fog and that rind was too much for me, cheese was awesome possum though pekinCheer
[0:14:09] CHOHSAN: Ah, alright.
[0:14:10] GenkiTheFrog: @PecXeus I dont think he often goes into games with a champ in mind
[0:14:14] 1TheRedFox: @Shcleepy ohyyeaa. thats that English one innit
[0:14:20] CHOHSAN: Well, I'm totally find with Starbucks going backrupt.
[0:14:26] nyellobello: Nidalee got buffed
[0:14:31] cr1ppl: I swear the balloon rate has been changed early game. feels like you have to get so lucky to get them
[0:14:33] CHOHSAN: If the product is garbage at least be morally decent as a company.
[0:14:39] rivernk: Starbucks is what??
[0:14:39] CHOHSAN: Tall ask in Amerikkka, though.
[0:14:47] ipood_32: what’s ur opinion on viego mr pekin, I will keep asking until the end of times
[0:14:50] Shcleepy: @1theredfox I do believe so? All I know is the cheese lady I bought it from said the rind was tasteless and it was in fact not
[0:15:05] dJustOne: When's the next smolder game
[0:15:11] 1TheRedFox: @Shcleepy oh hmmm. Well, glad I could help you expand your cheese knowledge

[0:16:10] bexus3: Does tank Smolder work or is it just a meme?
[0:16:10] 1TheRedFox: A really special cheese. It comes in a powdered form and is in a special green label container
[0:16:16] CHOHSAN: Oldge
[0:16:21] Ahruakurai: elekktro is only ok viego guy

[0:53:04] AntonyTLK1: BIG 30 true damage
[0:53:08] Heronian_: smolder stacking seems kinda painful
[0:53:10] giom97: Pobelter kinda getting destroyed
[0:53:16] LaserFlamingo: you guys did pretty good bot considering youre were vs pobelter on varus
[0:53:21] emma_4444_: every time i check your stream you're on the winning team lol
[0:53:21] trunnpet: wish i were getting destroyed :/
[0:53:30] pyroflexin: pekinAwoo
[0:53:33] TheLoFiAxolotl: @LaserFlamingo pobelter is mid...
[0:53:40] Swyteh: you should try swiftness boots with smolder, the movespeed with that + rfc feels so good
[0:53:41] the_name_is_pluto_: @trunnpet by who
[0:53:56] trunnpet: varus, ezreal, sett, yasuo, or yone
[0:53:57] RyanCRobert: i think they really need to change it so that if smolder dies mom does extra damage instead of nothing.
[0:54:04] elcapitan0310: is pekin queing bot or was he autofilled?
[0:54:08] trunnpet: @TheLoFiAxolotl no pobelter is the varus
[0:54:10] l_am_not_him: is this the new smoulder build that makes her op
[0:54:11] trunnpet: he was autofilled

[0:55:00] CHOHSAN: Damn, a global ult that casts postmortem?
[0:55:00] Lordbucketface: Still playing smolder huh
[0:55:02] TheLoFiAxolotl: @trunnpet pekin was trolling when he asked that.... pobelter is akali... you can literally check his stream
[0:55:07] arbitrary_stag: his mom should actually do more damage if he dies after calling her
[0:55:07] Heronian_: if smolder dies and his mom goes off, she should fly down and start fighting
[0:55:10] CHOHSAN: Do any other globals work that way? pekinThink
[0:55:10] Laigstore: Gragas is so op rn

[0:56:08] Kinkou_Order: once you finally hit silver you can get that much dmg
[0:56:09] TGKodama: @synopsis101 225 and he still won't ever burst harder than Varus
[0:56:09] Swyteh: you deal damage at 4 items but its still meh
[0:56:11] heinzbitte: 500 stacks should be good
[0:56:14] sebrebacitta: at the end of the game. It's like you're trying to say veigar sucks because his damage early game is shit
[0:56:14] ChadingoYitten: pekinEar AhriLickR
[0:56:16] Heronian_: catErm just scale for 30 mins and you’ll be almost as good as lvl 3 ezreal

[0:57:00] conkerzone: almost at triple digit stacks. wooo!

[2:02:51] NPCThree: Great YouTube video today Pekin, it was really believable that you weren't in a custom 💖
[2:02:53] ChadingoYitten: !zwag
[2:02:53] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting

[4:07:55] Nightbot: can we pwease have an ahwi game? uwu?
[4:08:05] troutyo: he just sucks that snot back up
[4:08:06] heybuddie: do your sneezes boomerang back to your face?
[4:08:09] Oreganeaux: the snot should pop at the end of its range and do small aoe
[4:08:11] waffle_gods: does the snot slow?
[4:08:11] poshleyheights: no but something about the way the animation slows makes me think it’s going to come back my brain is messed up
[4:08:13] troubble_bubble: e should reset on takedown now that we are at it
[4:08:13] Roozick: @trunnpet sorry PEKW
[4:08:15] Komlin111: the end splash is so hard to land but it has decent ap raitos

[4:08:19] trunnpet: KEKW
[4:08:21] corbins12345: yes*
[4:08:23] Oreganeaux: @heybuddie only when it’s windy
[4:08:24] DiscordPlate: you should be able to ignite the snot with his other abilities
[4:08:31] XiComfy: MOOOM
[4:08:40] frozennyogurt: duh
[4:08:42] statics_2: his MOOM should speed his allies
[4:08:45] FrankWasAce: MOOOOM
[4:08:46] Shcleepy: MOOOOM
[4:08:50] Lucasking03: cuh
[4:08:54] corbins12345: his mom should just do way more dmg
[4:08:54] Roozick: MOOOOM
[4:08:58] CowboyAndres: assist gaming right now, unfortunately
[4:09:01] Shcleepy: mom should fear enemies
[4:09:02] trunnpet: @statics_2 im overthinking it but that'd be wholesome. like they're rushing to help the baby
[4:09:06] FishSlayer4: hi pekky im back from vacation
[4:09:06] Coldgrave: corki damage monka
[4:09:12] the_name_is_pluto_: wow pekin you’re having an average gameplay experience. this should be a tuber!
[4:09:13] coldu_linlin: so even after the 225 stacks he sucks? or does he become viable
[4:09:14] DaRealFisto: the heal is also trash
[4:09:17] ana_lfabeta: e should apply onhits
[4:09:22] optiam1: instead of giving smolder all these cool new passives he should just do more damage
[4:09:26] CowboyAndres: i do like the doran ring W start
[4:09:34] sehxiedonuts: do you think he should get stacks from kills like vikor ?
[4:09:35] Toganezumi: and have 300% ap ratios YesYes
[4:09:36] gigasensei: smolder is fun, that's all that matters
[4:09:37] sinkanv: cannon 5 stacks
[4:09:39] pq258_: Senna enters chat
[4:09:46] Coldgrave: even syndra isn't great rn
[4:09:49] corbins12345: smolder ap good or nah?
[4:09:49] Coldgrave: all stackers are bad
[4:09:56] poshleyheights: better solution - nerf everything else
[4:09:57] Coldgrave: oh senna doesn't count
[4:09:59] XiComfy: Senna is fucked
[4:09:59] Coldgrave: shes too broken
[4:10:01] ana_lfabeta: q damage
[4:10:11] Shadic54321: nasus is dog
[4:10:11] benzasome: senna stacks are like the easiest think in the world to get tho
[4:10:14] ana_lfabeta: veigar also gets w cd
[4:10:15] Flairsurfer: a sol?
[4:10:16] Heronian_: what if he got like 1.3 stacks per hit rather than just 1
[4:10:17] statics_2: u think ppl will play him if he get buffs to be OP then nerffed him worse than before?
[4:10:18] Finlandium: Cannons and kills should give more stacks for smolder
[4:10:18] Komlin111: I think the problem is sheen being bad as well
[4:10:19] Coldgrave: viktor gets to be a champ
[4:10:19] Oreganeaux: senna gets range, crit, ad, and lifesteal
[4:10:19] sehxiedonuts: range
[4:10:20] benzasome: dont have to cs or anything
[4:10:22] Coldgrave: with his stacks
[4:10:24] superkami1057: She gets bs
[4:10:24] fishisgud312: almost all stats
[4:10:25] pq258_: ad
[4:10:28] ana_lfabeta: kindred too
[4:10:28] patooouu: tank btw
[4:10:36] SlickNikk: and AD
[4:10:38] XiComfy: TP KEKW
[4:10:39] the_name_is_pluto_: TELEPORT WASTED!
[4:10:43] shintoaliengod: attack range stat is the most busted
[4:10:44] heybuddie: the dhokla TP
[4:10:44] Toganezumi: OMEGALOOOOL
[4:10:48] fishisgud312: yea
[4:10:51] Heronian_: shrue
[4:10:52] Nightbot: shroo
[4:10:52] frickthislife: Def
[4:10:53] barterbilson: he man died for that stack
[4:10:54] DaRealFisto: thresh
[4:10:57] hewhocomz: nasus is worse
[4:10:58] Komlin111: he has to build glass cannon to do damage
[4:10:58] Shadic54321: nasus is worse
[4:11:00] ana_lfabeta: maybe nasus worse
[4:11:02] fishisgud312: and its harder stacking on him
[4:11:02] corbins12345: kindred stacks are insane
[4:11:04] Oreganeaux: yeah, he’s pretty trash champ
[4:11:04] Roozick: nah nasus is worse imo
[4:11:04] SoSalv: Nasus gets 3 damage :)
[4:11:06] hewhocomz: NASUS IS SO MUCH WORSE
[4:11:09] Dragonetta_: nasus is def worse
[4:11:10] Lazynameross: his stacks amp his spells besides q lol
[4:11:10] XiComfy: thresh isnt a carry tho
[4:11:11] benzasome: thresh isn't really his stacks ttho
[4:11:12] the_name_is_pluto_: thresh stacks don’t do a lot
[4:11:17] Heronian_: thresh feels strong the whole game tho
[4:11:18] SpitZ_L0L: yea elder sucks
[4:11:19] sinkanv: he gets like 50 gold a stack
[4:11:19] superkami1057: Thresh's identity isn't to stack
[4:11:22] the_name_is_pluto_: unless you do crit thresh
[4:11:23] statics_2: he gets ap also
[4:11:23] sphagert: it should be like asol where all his abelites upgrade with stakcs
[4:11:24] subawuba: the thing is thresh's kit in general is just super good
[4:11:24] Komlin111: need like 40 souls or more
[4:11:26] subawuba: unlike smolder's
[4:11:30] the_name_is_pluto_: you can maybe actually do something
[4:11:31] Shadic54321: more applicable than damage number go up
[4:11:31] benzasome: yes
[4:11:32] XiComfy: yes
[4:11:33] shintoaliengod: kindred sucks too Kappa
[4:11:37] POLVUZ: yea xdd
[4:11:37] Heronian_: yeah
[4:11:37] aeoti: what
[4:11:41] Phytos11: Yeah cus his kit LUL
[4:11:42] Phytos11: Yeah
[4:11:43] ballysack: Thresh basically doesn't get armor per level, so he has the passive to make up for it, but some games don't allow you to get a lot of stacks
[4:11:44] Oreganeaux: thresh into full AD comp is eventually unkillable to
[4:11:44] REKTorn_: Sion and swain?
[4:11:44] aeoti: he doesn't get armor per level
[4:11:45] iStalkCheese: thresh has trash base armor to compensate for his stacks
[4:11:47] troutyo: not if he didn't gain any armor
[4:11:49] aeoti: hes gonna be so squishy
[4:11:52] Komlin111: 40 smolder souls HUH
[4:11:53] pawkinese: kindred is a stacking champion too right
[4:11:54] barterbilson: w
[4:11:55] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: XDD
[4:11:57] UncleFuruncle: Asol stacks
[4:11:57] rick191112: Senna gets lifesteal once she has 100% crit. not a specific amount of stacks technically
[4:11:57] the_name_is_pluto_: thresh gets ap damage from his stacks right?
[4:11:58] hewhocomz: Nasus "nah id loe"
[4:12:01] Phytos11: Agreed
[4:12:03] ChadingoYitten: just play better
[4:12:05] hewhocomz: lose*
[4:12:14] fraughtgyre: Smolder minus stacks should have been a Corki rework TBH. His Eand R make so much snese
[4:12:18] coldu_linlin: he looks fun tho and aint this what league is about kappa
[4:12:28] troutyo: thresh has 28 base armor w/ no growth, if he didn't have passive he would explode
[4:12:29] optiam1: im 1o million you
[4:12:36] itsGazow: smoulder stacking isnt really stacks its just gates
[4:12:37] subawuba: @fraughtgyre wait you're cooking
[4:12:37] FishSlayer4: moakai tree go buuuuuuuuur
[4:12:37] arsenaltop4: @pekinwoof asol
[4:12:40] ana_lfabeta: @PekinWoof how would u compare kindred stacking
[4:12:42] Komlin111: stacking is just a crutch for good game design
[4:12:45] heybuddie: he obviously would have normal armor if they never gave him that passive
[4:12:48] felan25: smolder stacking is like syndra shards but worse
[4:12:50] UncleFuruncle: @fraughtgyre that makes so much sense, the R could be a huge bombing run
[4:13:02] Oreganeaux: smolder has a boring kit too
[4:13:06] fraughtgyre: @UncleFuruncle right?
[4:13:20] Kumajuhl: Smolder reached 50% win rate in master+, he's getting close to Yuumi lol
[4:13:20] Komlin111: but you cant expect more than 10 stacks a game vs humans
[4:13:21] Phytos11: Senna and Kindred stackings are crazy good
[4:13:23] corbins12345: kindred stacks are the hardest to get tho
[4:13:25] fraughtgyre: i was like "damn this is totally a plane guy kit"
[4:13:28] relaxed_Vic: whew
[4:13:29] zachi11es: rengar +20%ad
[4:13:29] ana_lfabeta: ok but that ult was hot
[4:13:30] Toganezumi: swain stacks? Hmmge
[4:13:33] statics_2: and shes a supp
[4:13:34] Tamiak_2Kopytnyi_: Sona stacks?
[4:13:40] relaxed_Vic: nice r
[4:13:41] nzan_: smolder should be able to heal his allies with his ult :)
[4:13:43] Kumajuhl: Aka next worst champ
[4:13:45] barterbilson: yooo
[4:13:48] ana_lfabeta: @zachi11es renagr is not infinitely stacking
[4:13:50] Chavita2: And range at 4 marks
[4:13:52] arsenaltop4: i think he needs lower cds
[4:13:57] sebrebacitta: accidentally showing smolder is pri good
[4:13:57] xReptarSC: sion stacks
[4:13:57] CowboyAndres: poppy stacks
[4:14:00] hewhocomz: idk what anybody says nasus stacks are the worst
[4:14:01] felan25: syndra stacks
[4:14:03] zachi11es: or do you not consider bone tooth necklace stacking champion either
[4:14:05] AlterSaberChan: Chogath staks
[4:14:07] coldu_linlin: but smolder’s aoe looks not to bad late game
[4:14:10] ballysack: Garen is technically a stacking champion
[4:14:14] Oreganeaux: sona only gets 120, and she only gets AH from it
[4:14:15] 4yearshardstuckteeemo: the only thing you somold with wtih champ is the LP xdd
[4:14:15] coldu_linlin: for an adc
[4:14:15] sehxiedonuts: I think you shuld get stacks from kills
[4:14:15] optiam1: sion
[4:14:18] Komlin111: sylas stacks xdd
[4:14:19] pixelgel: smokestacks?
[4:14:19] peacheelemon: has pekin tried Liandrys on smolder
[4:14:22] Chavita2: Sona has a 120 stack limit
[4:14:22] FrankWasAce: stacking champ tier list between queue for the engagement bait
[4:14:24] SoSalv: Garen stacks armor
[4:14:25] Phytos11: Ok we are just listing champs at this point HAHA
[4:14:26] iStalkCheese: like 1/3 of the champs in the game stack because people likenumber go up
[4:14:27] thantoaster: how does everyone always miss the point
[4:14:27] DaRealFisto: dark harvest
[4:14:27] AntonyTLK1: Sion stacks

[4:17:42] AntonyTLK1: Why you building zeal and not lrdr?
[4:17:43] Reedivan1: 225 stacks to just get a collector passive

[4:24:51] ballysack: @ImRikai 40 minutes ish
[4:24:55] statics_2: check if burn can stack @pekinwoof
[4:25:06] gigasensei: NOOW THAT'S A LOT OF DAMAGE
[4:25:09] CowboyAndres: hard for u or ur bot to side la e
[4:25:09] ezirai: riot went from releasing champs like yone and lilia that is op to smolder and hwei that is so useless lmao
[4:25:12] CowboyAndres: lane*
[4:25:17] Reedivan1: "hyperscalling"
[4:25:19] ballysack: @statics_2 It does not. It remains at 6.5%, but the execute threshold goes higher
[4:25:30] XiComfy: Rylais smolder is the move
[4:25:30] Komlin111: I feel like botrk could be good on him
[4:25:43] statics_2: i meant like gives you stacks if it kills the target @pekinwoof

[4:26:19] ChadingoYitten: @Shcleepy OMEGALOOOOL

[4:26:25] Komlin111: verySadge
[4:26:26] peacheelemon: this champ is so bobbins man
[4:26:27] teteus_: is corki allowed
[4:26:28] valentino4600: orn is anooying
[4:26:33] gorudo_prime: is smolder good?
[4:26:35] Oreganeaux: crazy that 300 stacks gives you almost no stats
[4:26:38] bazza_codekiller716: 2 games involving smolder 2 losses lol
[4:26:40] Lazynameross: senna typing btw
[4:26:41] peacheelemon: @gorudo_prime no lol
[4:26:42] drahm2030: This champ is a bait
[4:26:44] ballysack: @gorudo_prime 56% loss rate :)
[4:26:44] dc_bot: i feel like smolder is an ezrael with less damage and shorter range
[4:26:45] Tiifa: oh
[4:26:50] Komlin111: maybe crit is objectively the wrong way to play him
[4:26:56] ChadingoYitten: 5 PIGS LETSGO
[4:26:58] fire_r: i think his champ scaled harder
[4:27:00] gorudo_prime: no way... he is a dragon

[4:27:12] frozennyogurt: thanks i wont play him ok
[4:27:12] grimenishi: that was painful to watch how useless it is
[4:27:13] damian_mcknight: Champs has SCALES so it obviously scales
[4:27:22] gigasensei: He is good, the other champions that needs to be nerfed
[4:27:22] statics_2: @pekinwoof i meant like when a minion dies from the burn do you get stacks
[4:27:23] Komlin111: rekenton has better scaling at this point Offline
[4:27:27] Gavinb2313: wats more tilting is they usually have most dmg but suck
[4:27:35] xReptarSC: @PekinWoof it's so hard to get in q range when they all just go in on you if u get anywhere close
[4:27:38] CowboyAndres: ur jg and top didnt do much
[4:27:54] Heronian_: his Q should be a skill shot
[4:28:02] Komlin111: duration is so short
[4:28:05] bowedjavi: doenst feel smooth at all
[4:28:11] bowedjavi: i wish he went a bit slower
[4:28:13] Heronian_: the E should scale like asol W
[4:28:13] drahm2030: E is useless if you get slowed
[4:28:14] bowedjavi: he goes way too fast
[4:28:15] gorudo_prime: play more draven
[4:28:26] UncleFuruncle: @Heronian_ wait, it ISNT a skill shot??
