[0:09:50] Cegil_: HUH
[0:09:56] TheRealJimmyVA: galeHYPE
[0:10:23] redfiretruck80: streams of escape from tarkov look incredibly rough too
[0:10:44] Cegil_: OW is one of the better games to stream due to the lack of foliage and most type of small details. Only thing that makes it look garbo on low bitrates is the speed of OW
[0:11:05] Cegil_: But compared to any game with  heavy foliage OW looks crisp
[0:11:31] xdarkillazx: i still wanna know what type of recording software the overwatch league was using back in 2018 for that crisp gameplay

[0:16:22] stratz______: I have that issue when I run like 600fps on my 165hz monitor
[0:16:28] Arieyus: it feel likes that ow2 servers changed from the ow1 ones

[0:35:22] xd96heybaby: what is the point of the game please ?
[0:35:31] JRodJL: Im more interested than anything
[0:35:46] VinceDiego: AAAA
[0:35:47] JordxnFair: fuck that i dont miss double shield
[0:35:52] xdarkillazx: it was ok without double shield
[0:35:56] xdarkillazx: double shield was ass
[0:35:58] Godzillajk4567: only miss it bc of tank synergy
[0:35:59] krailu: 6v6 was fixable
[0:35:59] lonevisored90: Man, FUCK 6v6 LUL
[0:36:01] dandydandelionz: Clap Clap Clap
[0:36:09] JordxnFair: it made dps miserable
[0:36:12] JRodJL: Sam has just said 6v6 was better about 8000 times so everyone is just brainwashed now
[0:36:17] xdarkillazx: if they reworked orisa like they did
[0:36:19] xdarkillazx: it woulda been ok
[0:36:22] krailu: or make shield regen way slower
[0:36:22] JordxnFair: that requires them to acknowledge that theres an off tank and main tank role
[0:36:30] krailu: and with less shield hp
[0:36:42] krailu: @xdarkillazx or this
[0:36:45] Arieyus: having another tank made it so your main tank doesn't explode instantly lol
[0:36:49] redfiretruck80: lmao it's this moira
[0:37:12] JordxnFair: even tanks didnt like double tank because usually someone was being forced onto main / off tank
[0:37:57] xdarkillazx: just have a shield tank role and off tank roll would work like u said

[0:54:21] JordxnFair: hi lev shyjj
[0:55:34] Leverage56: That was a crazy bastion ult holy
[0:56:21] Arieyus: people say junk is annoying
[0:56:43] Leverage56: I dont get why they keep buffing her. Like the only people that like her are tracer players. There are so many easy ways to balance her and still let be a decent pick but they just dont do it
[0:57:00] Leverage56: Honestly can we bring back ow2 launch tracer? KEKW
[0:57:15] Arieyus: then you get bluelighted across the map and tracer doing whatever she wants
[0:57:40] Leverage56: I would say junk is annoying for a different reason
[0:57:46] Cegil_: @Leverage56 Blizzard - Best we can do is buff HP of dps and supports :)
[0:58:00] Arieyus: true
[0:58:16] Cegil_: junk didnt need the second mine
[0:58:33] Leverage56: Tracer is annoying cause people do a line of adderal and you can never kill her. Junk is annoying cause a literal fucking chimp could get value with junk KEKW
[0:58:49] Arieyus: lmao
[0:58:53] Leverage56: Im willing to see how the hp buff does to make the game better tbh
[0:59:22] YellowMorning: NICE sleep
[0:59:23] redfiretruck80: holy moly
[0:59:25] Arieyus: junk is gonna need two mines after the health buff
[0:59:26] Leverage56: Like at this point at least they are actually giving us big changes to the game without needing to release a whole new fucking game KEKW
[0:59:28] sarpatv: sheesh
[0:59:38] ãƒ—ãƒ­ãƒ†ã‚¤ãƒ³08: Pog
[1:00:01] dumpster_ow: how lose with lebron
[1:00:06] Cegil_: @Leverage56 They will end up powercreeping DMG so much that it will feel like the HP buff never happened
[1:00:18] Cegil_: Just give it 3-4 seasons
[1:00:20] Leverage56: I still feel like they need to make junk less of a random spam character. Idk like maybe make his dmg decrease with each bounce
[1:01:09] Leverage56: Oh trust me ik they are. I have zero faith in this balance team to consistently make changes that improve the game. At this point i just hope for 1 in ever 4 patches to be good KEKW @Cegil_
[1:01:50] Arieyus: go back to two tanks after the health buff
[1:02:19] Leverage56: Bro we should just go back to ow1 at this point. Sure it had flaws but it is better than this shit is KEKW
[1:02:44] Cegil_: imagine kiriko in goats monkaS
[1:02:56] Arieyus: they already did that with brig
[1:02:59] Leverage56: We dont talk about that monkaW
[1:03:10] Leverage56: Kiri would have made goats even worse
[1:03:11] Arieyus: with her rework
[1:03:51] Cegil_: or LW in goats
[1:03:59] Cegil_: Nothing would die from the heal spam
[1:04:11] Leverage56: I bet the comp would have been kiri, lw, and brig with goats
[1:04:22] Leverage56: No one would ever die
