[0:48:51] Xekani: @doG_emiT if you're new, the best way to get a foundation understanding is to watch videos honestly. i usually just type "KR challenger <champ name>" in youtube to get a basic understanding of what you're supposed to do

[0:49:26] clarkhenri: does he ever play zoe?
[0:49:30] T2rollin: can i type NA challenger and get the same result?
[0:49:31] Redfactor3: @Xekani those can be hard to parse if you have 0 info, i.e. information overload. But yeah those are great if you already have some foundation and can self teach
