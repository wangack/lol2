[0:25:14] theolliebb: 2 󠀀

[0:26:24] pielord599: @TotalIyNotATaco thats sick, makes sense why its good then. similar interaction like with senna

[0:26:35] Ikancast: TwitchRPG
[0:26:37] theclamdestroyer: @demonminer3 yes, any higher alcohol content and the alcohol kills off the bacteria that ferments it, that’s when you start needing a still if you want something stronger

[0:27:12] yertlesturtle: QTpie did 3-4 W. seemed strong for bot lane trades
[0:27:14] WiltingWisteria: the thing about early points in w is that it preps the caster minions to all die with 1 Q after, even rank 1 Q
[0:27:15] ShakeandbakeAK: E max nasus is good vs ranged though
[0:27:28] theclamdestroyer: @lourlo you don’t trade with the W max build, you just poke

[0:28:04] demonminer3: @theclamdestroyer interesting fact, the alcohol in wine and beer and such, actually made it healthier to drink than water in some areas, since water filtration wasnt as big then.

[0:29:40] BeRT2me: Erm
[0:29:47] demonminer3: @demonminer3 this isnt because the drinks were actually healthy to drink relative to clean water, but the alcohol killed the dangerous bacteria that would otherwise be present.
