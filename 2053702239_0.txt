[0:00:45] 2badwtf: that was quick
[0:01:14] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: time for another autopsy?
[0:01:21] d_kowalski: Ah C9. Thank God for their downfall, LCS was in dangers of having the most boring split ever
[0:01:53] shootmyfaceoff: 100T is really exciting for me as a fan
[0:02:40] Giiino: c9 lost that game more than TL won it, right?
[0:03:01] carbonstylus: as long as they have fudge as a top laner they just gonna drown
[0:03:17] DixMX: yo
[0:03:39] exodia0077: @carbonstylus this sentence just shows u havent watched their games
[0:03:40] exodia0077: lol
[0:03:43] imnotkreative11: all C9 has to do is give blaber,jojo, and vulcan champs with actuals buttons to play the game and they win league easy, just refusing to do so atm
[0:03:47] DixMX: AYAYA
[0:04:00] SaltineCracker94: Draft his been the biggest issue with C9 imo
[0:04:13] Giiino: jojo sucked on orianna today imo
[0:04:26] carbonstylus: jojo is the only one getting advantages in lane in every game
[0:04:45] redf0running: First and most simple step to fixing C9, stop drafting Lucian
[0:05:11] d_kowalski: Is BDS unironically the current best western team?
[0:05:27] DixMX: I haven't kept up with LCS since last week, looking forward to this dissection of C9

[0:06:11] redf0running: I think JoJo would do really good on a team with River, a jungle that will sacrifice to spam gank for him all game
[0:06:45] XLOftw: i got my popcorns readyyyyyy
[0:06:57] redf0running: Best western team is currently Estral
[0:07:14] fjord3: jojo has to be the most overrated western mid laner of all time
[0:07:19] DixMX: what about Summit's R7? Kappa
[0:07:24] SaltineCracker94: C9 If they drafted more strong jungle mid combos and engage supports they would end up winning more games imo
[0:07:26] Gikeuri13: @fjord3 shit like this is so revisionist
[0:07:30] dowiet: sea nine
[0:07:30] PapaSmithy: No FlyQuest today PepeHands
[0:07:38] DixMX: @fjord3 define overrated

[0:07:53] lazink: Flyquest is looking like the best team
[0:07:53] Gikeuri13: Whenever a team or play has a bad stint people get SO fucking revisionist and say they've always been frauds. Its so cringe

[0:08:27] Juicypika: wawa
[0:08:37] enreves: I thought super team was a bit of a stretch
[0:08:49] SaltineCracker94: It's cool that IMT might actually be a play off team
[0:09:13] fatalqwerty: Immortals is kinda amazing, I've always thought it as an org will just fizzle and die after a few bad splits, but they're still here
[0:09:14] Gikeuri13: Honestly think players are fine. Their team play and draft have been dog though (C9)
[0:09:20] Scruffymonkeh: og lineup c9 was the only super version of c9
[0:09:32] d_kowalski: Fudge is completely invisible
[0:09:36] DixMX: IMT scrim bucks going crazy
[0:09:39] sexualeagle: Fudge goes from being ls wonder child to playing gnar.
[0:09:50] d_kowalski: Realistically he should want to run the region

[0:13:28] hiimaeia: BASED

[0:14:15] is__nova: you seriously need a home-grown tomato. yes.

[0:15:10] BinglyTinson: home grown are definitely much better, definitely cant hate on the home grown tomato caprese. still not like a giga fan tho
[0:15:11] deribou: my mom used to grow cherry tomatoes when i was kid
[0:15:15] deribou: ate those like candy
[0:15:21] LuxtheGod: i find homegrown tomatoes even worse than store bought... i just don't like tomatoes raw
[0:15:23] phinvincible: my family grows hundreds of tomatoes every summer, i only eat those now the store bought ones taste like chlorine to me
[0:15:26] epicalbawler: okra is god tier
[0:15:27] sexualeagle: MonteChristo AKA the Tomato Poet
[0:15:28] DankWizard420: @Gikeuri13 been meaning to figure out how to do bread Susge it's on my todo list
[0:15:39] hiimaeia: okra's disgusting, feels like you're eating someone's saliva

[0:25:13] BinglyTinson: based asian culture just letting us ooga booga out
[0:25:14] kookoolau: but ezreal and karma are still not a good pick, because lining face and teamfight are not good enough
[0:25:16] kraethan: I legit love malignance, its a really cool item

[0:41:38] SomeFerretGuy: azael been saying some really weird things about items recently
[0:41:39] najafan: The argument is that upgrading from Orb is useless compared to other items.
[0:41:42] imnotkreative11: i feel like lethality varus here seems bad, othe team has too much shield/heal
[0:41:45] kup95: @zazentsuko to old for this now u are right , just time to think about the good old times in s2 , 3,4

[0:42:54] Zelgius: Lethality is the only good Varus build here, he's never autoing Ori/Ez
[0:42:58] sigmaballs2: i do think zven was better than vulcan on enchanters
[0:43:15] Aoyos_: Ivern running through mid to get to camps while giving bushes and shields to Ori is so obnoxious for Trist
[0:43:26] imnotkreative11: @Zelgius dont feel like thats his job, trist/varus job should be to burn aatrox/bard/daisy then imt cant do anything
[0:43:47] commando1814: holy shit an Ori not going tear 1st - since when
[0:43:47] SomeFerretGuy: wwe do!

[0:44:15] najafan: There is.
[0:44:19] najafan: C9 has 6
[0:44:25] sigmaballs2: only thing i hate is no dr timer
[0:44:25] Amosdragon: The UI needs some changes.
[0:44:29] fistigons25: between the tower and gold count
[0:44:34] najafan: It's just an awful graphic
[0:44:39] Giiino: yeah no drag timers
[0:44:43] CupahJoJo: LCS overlay this year sucks ass
[0:44:43] Zelgius: Dragon timers are bugged on the patch or something
[0:44:44] Warzard908: @Amosdragon they fired the people who were working on it
[0:44:45] fistigons25: dragon timer not being there is fucked up
[0:44:47] zen__cloud: dragon timers got bugged in both LEC and LCS
[0:44:55] SomeFerretGuy: grub counter is right there smadge
[0:44:56] TheOnymous: Grub counter is next to money at the top yeah?
[0:44:57] Amosdragon: @Warzard908 True, true.
[0:45:00] viruztime: how hard is it to put a timer up
[0:45:01] buzz97: There is a grub counter
[0:45:02] archie7497: Dragon timer is some bug with 14.2 patch. Dom said it on stream iirc
[0:45:06] kraethan: Yeah drag timer is gone, grub counter is between gold and towers
[0:45:08] squires: Grub counter is next to gold counters

[0:45:15] najafan: There literally is a grub counter
[0:45:26] jellyfishtrain: no dragon though
[0:45:26] fatalqwerty: wait where?
[0:45:26] RedLine__05: Dragon timer top left
[0:45:29] kerokerogrips: rip, imo they should always lay off PM's before engineers ,
[0:45:32] dowiet: monte is just channeling his inner lee sin
[0:45:37] The_LostProphet: @najafan I thought that was a plate counter
[0:45:44] sigmaballs2: top left is herald timer @RedLine__05
[0:45:45] Zebrios: @MonteCristo to be fair, your opinion still isn't wrong on the whole.
[0:45:47] Aoyos_: LCS is using a black letters on top of a white screen for infographics now during preshow etc
[0:45:52] commando1814: way to go Reddit mode monte !
[0:45:53] Nytrodark: WHAT THE FUCK THE BOT LANE IS FINE. HOW THE FUCK WE LOSE THIS SHIT WTF IS GOING ON C9
[0:45:54] RedLine__05: My bad
[0:46:00] TheOnymous: I only  knew it was a grub counter because I already knew they had 6. Those looks like sombrero counters.
[0:46:02] buzz97: How is there not a dragon timer???
[0:46:03] DixMX: they actually laid off the guy counting down the dragon spawn, LCS is so doomed
[0:46:04] Fluffieface: "what's wrong with C9" - champion choices.
[0:46:08] Zebrios: How does C9 lose this?
[0:46:18] J__Carson: dragon timer is patch Glitch I believe
[0:46:19] Alderr1: C9 is still strong in laning, the midgame teamfights are just bad
[0:46:27] najafan: @The_LostProphet It went from 3 to 6 all at once, so no

[0:46:46] 국거박: I just translated your message into Korean as you requested, and man the traction the post is getting lol.
[0:46:51] Nytrodark: @TheOnymous no
[0:46:56] catanenjoyer: @MonteCristo do u think c9 should try and get emenes back?
[0:46:57] Zebrios: The only problem I can see is they only have Rell for hard engage.
[0:46:57] The_LostProphet: @najafan True but I looked away I am not gonna lie and C9 having 6 plates makes sense XD
[0:46:59] squires: The weird thing is that they've lost every game differently. If each loss had happened individually, I would have called them flukes.
[0:47:01] SomeFerretGuy: hahaha monte drama Pog
[0:47:18] najafan: @The_LostProphet IMT should have at least one, right?
[0:47:26] Aoyos_: Jojo being unable to get a lead or a single gold plate while Ori getting a plate herself is insane even with the Ivern help
[0:47:28] najafan: In mid?
[0:47:31] RedLine__05: how do you decide where to put your mid/top in sidelanes?
[0:47:42] enreves: Their shotcaller was sent back to EU

[0:48:24] SomeFerretGuy: nope c9 demise first
[0:48:30] Aoyos_: You need to get Jojo out of mid lane, he's getting no advantages with the Ivern babysitting Ori
[0:48:30] hotblew1337: word thanks ^
[0:48:34] najafan: btw, Monte, he translated your statement to Korean and posted it.
[0:48:39] The_LostProphet: @hotblew1337 C9 has a check up appointment first
[0:48:39] bilboblaze: ty
[0:48:43] Zelgius: @RedLine__05 Depends which objective you want to play for, dragon/baron and whether their TP is up
[0:48:48] DankWizard420: naram PauseChamp
[0:49:02] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Why is Trist getting shoved in so hard by Ori?  I feel like Jojo doesn't want to push lane or something.
[0:49:17] RedLine__05: @Zelgius gracias amigo
[0:49:42] Aoyos_: @Zebrios Ivern keeps routing through mid to give her bushes and shields so Jojo never applies pressure or trades
[0:49:55] DankWizard420: oblivion orb udyr WutFace
[0:50:10] sigmaballs2: also its an ocean drake lmao
[0:50:15] najafan: @DankWizard420 Against Aatrox, yes.
[0:50:17] Zebrios: @Aoyos_ Even so, with Trist bomb, there's no reason Jojo should be getting no shove.
[0:50:24] bilboblaze: yeah not sure guess they said lets play safe
[0:50:35] Hi_ImPhantomere: is this the weakest that NA has ever looked?
[0:50:42] DixMX: they probably want to open Top for better Herald position no?
[0:50:51] Aoyos_: @Zebrios I agree, Jojo is just lost in how to deal with the situation, he keeps getting out-traded
[0:50:52] Zelgius: Did he try to W?
[0:50:57] Alderr1: It is a hard buffer to do

[0:51:34] leamfor: @MonteCristo Sneaky, Meteos, and DL had to go into Custom. You can't buffer that.
[0:51:34] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:51:42] Zelgius: and then flashes anyway lol
[0:51:43] DankWizard420: yuge greed PepeLaugh
[0:51:43] CBRTheDon: flashes anyways lol
[0:51:44] Aoyos_: There's no need to buffer Bard ult though, you just Rocket Jump on use of bard ult
[0:51:45] Jeffp2662: that was embarrasingly bad
[0:52:08] BigCohones: and he wasted flash
[0:52:19] Zebrios: He should've jumped as soon as they started running at him
[0:52:20] Zelgius: +28g EZ
[0:52:21] DankWizard420: watches bard b line towards him too
[0:52:22] Aoyos_: He has over a second to rocket jump and waits until the last instant
[0:52:22] Jeffp2662: could have flashed the ori ult too
[0:52:24] DixMX: I do that shit in gold SoloQ, why is he doing that on stage? lol
[0:52:27] bilboblaze: thats bronze not paing attention
[0:52:30] leamfor: @MonteCristo You used to be able to buffer it, and I think he was operating on the assumption he still could buffer it.
[0:52:38] Ikancast: and commits the flash in the end anyways
[0:52:44] najafan: tbf, I understand him trying to w there.
[0:52:44] josedasfaias: and then wastes flash anyways wtf WutFace
[0:52:45] CBRTheDon: loses flash instead of flashing bard ult lol
[0:52:50] DankWizard420: 5% flash Pog
[0:52:50] najafan: It was wrong, but I get it.
[0:52:55] bilboblaze: 150 gold a person for drag thats not worth
[0:53:00] Zebrios: Blaber had a good engage angle there, and they still lose this fight.
[0:53:02] Aoyos_: @najafan You can w early though, no reason to buffer
[0:53:21] najafan: @Aoyos_ I said I understand. Not that I agree.
[0:53:26] leamfor: If you can buffer it, then it is objectively right to buffer it.
[0:53:29] sigmaballs2: ivern shielded so much dmg this game
[0:53:32] Zelgius: Double tp on enemy team, none on your own
[0:53:52] leamfor: If you don't buffer it, then it can be cancelled. Since it can't be buffered anymore, it's just a bad matchup.
[0:54:02] PapaSmithy: serpents varus mis
[0:54:19] Zebrios: That would've been at least 2 kills.
[0:54:34] BigCohones: yooo papasmithy. i still miss you on broadcast man
[0:54:37] catanenjoyer: im down for flyquest to win lcs
[0:54:57] Zebrios: @PapaSmithy Hi Papa.  How you doing?
[0:54:58] redsevn: game needs more shield-breaking items
[0:55:02] leamfor: @catanenjoyer As long as Massu and Busio continue to improve laning, FLY will win.
[0:55:17] trueaether: is imt 3-3 or 4-3 as of today?
[0:55:24] DixMX: @MonteCristo they probably wanted to open Top side for better Herald position? that's why Jojo was trying to push mid?
[0:55:24] trueaether: 3-4 rather
[0:55:27] PapaSmithy: they're grinding super hard with arrow each day, certain they'll continue to scale
[0:55:28] sigmaballs2: 3-4
[0:55:31] leamfor: @leamfor Topside is just better in every role.
[0:55:32] dowiet: @PapaSmithy i enjoyed your casts I hope you are doing well these days CoolCat
[0:55:49] MissingMatter: It's a real slow kill on herald, almost traded the whole bot turret for it.
[0:56:01] bilboblaze: which isnt worth
[0:56:08] DixMX: ah
[0:56:09] AzureCatalyst: wait is arrow with the Flyquest org as a positional coach?
[0:56:17] PapaSmithy: ya bot lane positional coach
[0:56:21] CupahJoJo: what does full tank udyr even do
[0:56:25] hibbjibb: cristoCAKE cristoCAKE but they cant eat this cake
[0:56:25] Zebrios: Man C9 is playing just scared as hell.  What is going on?
[0:56:32] DankWizard420: @CupahJoJo never die
[0:56:44] leamfor: @PapaSmithy We believe in them <3 I hope to meet Jensen again at a Finals this year, so make it happen for us fans again! I only got to see him at poor DIG booth in New Jersey :(

[0:57:09] hellohihi145: fly and imt make msi atm
[0:57:30] Elysian_Shine: how do you feel so far about the LCS changes? @MonteCristo
[0:57:32] AzureCatalyst: botlane*
[0:57:32] DankWizard420: jojo monkaHmm
[0:57:34] BigCohones: @hellohihi145 fair, that seems to be true this year. bottom teams actually have brains now
[0:57:35] unknown87644: c9 was at the top but now other teams have caught up
[0:57:47] xkravianx: Any thoughts about udyr win rate in LCS vs other leagues?
[0:57:53] Zebrios: Somebody check Jojo's Paypal account.
[0:57:59] Zebrios: This looks sus as hell
[0:58:01] SomeFerretGuy: @unknown87644 naaaaaah
[0:58:04] Dragonk226: So, what did happen to c9?
[0:58:05] hellohihi145: c9 has not changed or improved in 2 years epople jsut finally learned what to do against them
[0:58:10] SomeFerretGuy: this is regression not catchup
[0:58:12] Dragonk226: And is fly just the best team in the league?
[0:58:13] Neumonyx: hi hi, happy to be hear
[0:58:19] bilboblaze: did arrow have any success in na didnt he play for kt ?
[0:58:26] sigmaballs2: @hellohihi145 thats cap, berserker is clearly playing worse
[0:58:38] hellohihi145: you cant tell me c9 all opf last year was scale and hope berserker carries
[0:58:41] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo make sure to watch the APA interview after the liquid vs c9 game
[0:58:47] hellohihi145: they literally won spring with that exact playstyle
[0:58:50] PapaSmithy: overlay bug this week i guess
[0:58:52] Zelgius: just not a thing this patch
[0:58:53] leamfor: @bilboblaze He played on Phoenix1 and got 3rd place in Spring 2017, along with an MVP.
[0:58:53] silentmilkTTV: aatrox seems so bad now
[0:59:02] hellohihi145: @sigmaballs2 berserker is getting punished early finally*
[0:59:07] confusedblue_: Supposedly the patch is the issue for the overlay
[0:59:11] DixMX: they laid off the person counting down the dragon spawn PoroSad
[0:59:13] AzureCatalyst: the C9 classic strat of waiting for the enemy to int
[0:59:14] ADrugge: Overlay feature*
[0:59:15] Zebrios: @silentmilkTTV Watch Zeus play it and say that.
[0:59:18] bilboblaze: @leamfor ohhhh yeah when tsm lost to them hahaha
[0:59:36] DixMX: KEKHeim
[0:59:37] sigmaballs2: @hellohihi145 hes just playing bad lol
[0:59:37] PapaSmithy: they show replay
[0:59:38] Hi_ImPhantomere: ??????
[0:59:39] PapaSmithy: it was a bit rip
[0:59:40] Giiino: he even smited???
[0:59:41] DankWizard420: LUL
[0:59:45] butelka_z_odzysku: NA talent
[0:59:48] leamfor: @bilboblaze That was in Summer 2016, Arrow and Ryu came over for Spring 2017
[0:59:50] Zebrios: That's gotta just be greed trying to save smite
[0:59:54] xkravianx: Observers please
[0:59:55] zoneado: look at blabber take a drink of water of rage
[0:59:57] Nytrodark: Sadge
[0:59:59] Imaslapyou: LCS LUL
[1:00:04] hellohihi145: well if berserker is finally having a bad split c9 is complete;y doomed
[1:00:04] DankWizard420: I'd run it down if that happened in soloq PepeLaugh
[1:00:05] bilboblaze: @leamfor for vacation :P
[1:00:08] Giiino: LUL
[1:00:10] Legi1: ???
[1:00:12] Zebrios: Blaber no.
[1:00:13] unknown87644: LOL
[1:00:14] hellohihi145: cuz that is their playstyle. pray berserker will carry
[1:00:17] DilfZaddy: close!
[1:00:17] AdmiralReggie: FailFish
[1:00:24] MrWooody: "talent"
[1:00:24] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo the gap is closing
[1:00:25] PapaSmithy: cho'gath with feast moment.
[1:00:25] AzureCatalyst: blabber yes lmfao
[1:00:27] DankWizard420: LUL
[1:00:28] butelka_z_odzysku: in a scale 1-10 how bad that was?
[1:00:34] StuntmanStan: according to meteos blaber doesnt take hexflash which is unusual
[1:00:36] Knait0: scripted KEKHeim
[1:00:40] CwyLoL: thats tactical Kappa
[1:00:40] dah777: is that the corrrect order to smite then Q or vise versa?
[1:00:43] mikejanderson: i dont know at all but dont you q -> smite?
[1:00:45] Jeffp2662: wouldnt it be better to q smite instead of smite q
[1:00:47] Elysian_Shine: god gilius wouldnt miss that smite
[1:00:48] poointheloo91: Checj tactical flash KEJ
[1:00:49] vedana9: lmao
[1:00:56] leamfor: @bilboblaze They were quite good at the time and remained so for some years. And Ryu came from being on H2K for years, so if anything he was already on vacation OMEGALUL
[1:01:15] mikejanderson: yeah its unfortunate
[1:01:16] DilfZaddy: how much sky would a trueshot even do
[1:01:19] DilfZaddy: dmg
[1:01:25] unknown87644: tactical trying to rob everything
[1:01:30] Jeffp2662: thats just trolling him now
[1:01:36] DankWizard420: @DilfZaddy level1 ult? like 300 I think it i
[1:01:46] dah777: who was that one player in lck who always stole buff with ez ult?
[1:01:47] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:01:49] 1DeepBlue: there wasn't even a ward on that dragon
[1:01:50] Edge2G: are we being for real right now lmao? just smite under 1200
[1:01:51] Zebrios: I think they tried to engage mid
[1:01:58] leamfor: @dah777 Was it Pray?
[1:01:59] JanYLbert: that's just disrespect, even if there are no enemy team nearby you should always smite on smite kill HP
[1:02:04] PPowzer74: right there LUL
[1:02:05] unknown87644: maybe a varus r
[1:02:09] killerpineapple1: looks like he flased some sort of engage
[1:02:14] leamfor: Berserker flashed too
[1:02:14] najafan: Berserker flashed too
[1:02:15] DankWizard420: @JanYLbert it's the definition of a mechanical test LUL
[1:02:15] najafan: Yeah
[1:02:15] Zebrios: Berserker's flash is down too
[1:02:15] dah777: @dah777  maybe
[1:02:19] Aoyos_: Berserker flashed to ult
[1:02:21] killerpineapple1: varus r only ult on cd
[1:02:30] leamfor: YEP
[1:02:31] Jeffp2662: flash chains prob
[1:02:35] OmegaHiro: It's insane they don't show live during replaya
[1:02:48] leamfor: @OmegaHiro layoffs
[1:03:02] DixMX: LUL
[1:03:06] Zebrios: Flash for Flash seems better for Ezreal, no?
[1:03:07] JeeFour: I smart :)
[1:03:10] DilfZaddy: @dankwizard420 if only 300 I never get why jgs try and time the smite to high hp… just over smite lower hp lol
[1:03:11] leamfor: YEP We smart
[1:03:14] butelka_z_odzysku: but why is there 1 kill in 21 minute?
[1:03:20] Zelgius: He got two flashes, Bard flash too
[1:03:25] bilboblaze: @leamfor what happened to mike yung xD
[1:03:27] BostromTV: tuned in just in time for NA tomfoolery ;)
[1:03:27] Elysian_Shine: agreed
[1:03:32] burdil3z: wsp its bangers only time?
[1:03:33] Imaslapyou: LUL
[1:03:33] Emilytacular: so true
[1:03:34] PapaSmithy: (spoiler): C9 can't progress games if enemy doesn't run into them
[1:03:35] MadsUlka: Ezreal should just cleanse arcane shift varus ult
[1:03:38] DilfZaddy: hey dad 👋
[1:03:45] silentmilkTTV: mans has a thesaurus open on second monitor
[1:03:46] unknown87644: so can u buffer trist w with bard r or how does that work @MonteCristo
[1:03:49] Imaslapyou: I will admit we are exceedingly erudite
[1:03:49] sp3xWestside: Hey @MonteCristo How you doing hope all is well with everything
[1:03:49] AzureCatalyst: DILF Zaddy Monte is on my bingo card
[1:03:50] hotblew1337: @PapaSmithy LOLOLOL
[1:04:01] bilboblaze: u cant
[1:04:08] leamfor: @bilboblaze Exposed when he went to TSM for Spring 2018 and Mithy literally had to teach him how to jungle. Benched for Grig the next split.
[1:04:10] Adanion: Summon me and I shall appear Dilfs for everyone
[1:04:13] Komarimasita: omg its papa <3
[1:04:13] Aoyos_: @unknown87644 No and it can catch you mid flight too
[1:04:39] leamfor: Blaber is just bad at Rell. Simple as that.
[1:04:43] Edge2G: cant jump golden lol
[1:04:45] DilfZaddy: Monte’s secretly my dad so he’s Dilf Zaddy Daddy
[1:04:45] MissingMatter: 6 grub Tris obviously has a hard time taking turrets
[1:04:47] butelka_z_odzysku: vulcan is giga overhyped
[1:04:51] DankWizard420: @leamfor listen it's his first time PepeLaugh
[1:04:53] AzureCatalyst: I love how C9 has just morphed into TSM from 2016
[1:04:59] chickenwingerrr: @PapaSmithy I love watching fly btw, can't wait to see some cool drafts from ur botlane they look so nice alr
[1:05:02] chemicalV012: aram top into lose, a staple of na
[1:05:09] ADrugge: So we can waste TP
[1:05:09] Zebrios: TP for what?
[1:05:11] JeeFour: was that tp necessary?
[1:05:18] killerpineapple1: hard force top for baron set up? they maybe feeling desperate
[1:05:23] nks93: Fudge wanted wave, worth it for loss of tp Kappa
[1:05:29] dah777: monkaHmm
[1:05:31] najafan: FUDGE
[1:05:33] JeeFour: jojo was bot for that defense, when udyr tp'd
[1:05:35] najafan: HOLLOW RADIANCE
[1:05:36] Komarimasita: @PapaSmithy  I remember you talking about your psych background years ago on cast and and now I'm in my final year of Psych nurse practitioner!
[1:05:36] najafan: WHY
[1:05:40] najafan: NO
[1:05:44] Emilytacular: hey monte have you heard of the Terra Ignota series by Ada Palmer? Excellent SciFi books grounded in philosophy and classics
[1:05:44] leamfor: @AzureCatalyst 2017, in 2016 Svenskeren was an animal that didn't just farm, and bot was perma winning. Berserker/Vulcan doesn't perma win
[1:05:47] aldrfia: come and def after the tower is gone
[1:05:52] PapaSmithy: @Komarimasita Oh damn, thats awesome! Wish you the best of luck with that
[1:05:53] najafan: YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAVE NA TOPS
[1:05:56] najafan: NOT JOIN THEM
[1:05:59] Komarimasita: thank you :)
[1:06:01] Edge2G: its fine
[1:06:02] DankWizard420: tping to t2 always looks grief idk
[1:06:27] nks93: He gets the wave, worth
[1:06:34] Zebrios: Imagine if he had TP for this chase.
[1:06:38] AzureCatalyst: @leamfor Ah I am improperly remembering the TSM iterations. Thanks for the correction.
[1:07:14] Alderr1: Format talk, everyone take 10

[1:07:19] McDumps: Off subject, 49ers or Chiefs?
[1:07:20] leamfor: Not unless you're FLY, amiright @PapaSmithy
[1:07:23] dah777: monkaHmm odd... yes...
[1:07:32] mikejanderson: + live patch
[1:07:33] MoldyCalzone: If only their was a format that could solve those issues
[1:07:33] hellohihi145: dont blame the format for c9 bad play
[1:07:39] Knait0: Exactly, in a given day.....
[1:07:43] QuackTheDuck: maybe we should do bo3 monkaHmm
[1:07:43] snowcappedmtn: GO Broncos!
[1:07:44] Elysian_Shine: would be quite funny if lcs died before ever going back to bo3
[1:07:45] ace_alchemist: Hmm bo1s .. variance..
[1:07:48] chemicalV012: mahomes throw ball good he must get ball bowl
[1:07:50] Tears_0f_sin: i'm a rams fan i can't have 49ers winning
[1:07:50] androidx117: 100% sure that C9 would still be 0-2 or 1-2
[1:07:50] hotblew1337: Let's go 49ers
[1:07:50] Amosdragon: The format is garbage. The game can be over for the dumbest of reasons super early into a game. So Bo1s just means you'll sometimes get blown up even if you are the better team.
[1:07:51] Giiino: did you hate the brady patriots or mahomes chiefs more?
[1:07:53] McDumps: I'm a Pats fan, and don't want the Chiefs to repeat, as the Pats were the last to do it 03-04
[1:07:56] primeatron: best TE in the league?
[1:08:10] Edge2G: just win your matches 4Head
[1:08:13] leamfor: @McDumps Thanks for giving me a reason to cheer for the Chiefs then.
[1:08:14] silentmilkTTV: but then kelce cant propose to tswift after the game. the SCRIPT is written
[1:08:17] hotblew1337: San Francisco C9'ers winning the bowl or Karmine Corp?
[1:08:21] Martinmacleod1: this is a fast paced game damn
[1:08:24] xkravianx: Berserker has serpents at least
[1:08:29] McDumps: @leamfor <3
[1:08:30] chemicalV012: @McDumps commit sleeping on a bed in the nether irl, pats fans dont deserve human rights
[1:08:33] MissingMatter: LCS just emulating NFL bo1 format. It's popular, right?
[1:08:34] najafan: @silentmilkTTV Exactly! They can heal our broken nation.
[1:08:35] MadsUlka: Why have bo5 to decide the best team when you can have bo1
[1:08:39] fruge2: dont disrespect rashee rice like that monte
[1:08:40] AntiquusTonitrus_3: i dont anyone to win cuz fuq 9ers fans and fuq the KC
[1:08:41] TwelveK: Rice has really stepped up on the Chiefs.
[1:08:51] Voltiate: Chiefs receiving core KEKW
[1:08:55] MrWooody: Berserker has F
[1:09:00] scoobysnacksac: Chiefs having no relievers has been wrong in playoffs
[1:09:01] Zebrios: Bard ult clips Berserker and Jojo still goes in.
[1:09:09] AzureCatalyst: Oh wow berseker holds his nerve and doesn't flash
[1:09:13] AzureCatalyst: THOW DOES JOJO GET CAUGHT
[1:09:14] Simpesttv: Trav been the best TE in the play offs
[1:09:25] DontBanNida: Karma buying Shurelya's, fail...
[1:09:39] leamfor: WAIT, GO OVER THE WALL!!! JOJO??
[1:09:45] JanYLbert: wow, 1 kill in 24 minutes, this doesn't look like NA region
[1:09:45] QuackTheDuck: I mean it was a good magical journey
[1:09:46] DreamNail_: Olleh lowkey winning this whole exchange by himself
[1:09:49] hotblew1337: MVS had only 10 more receptions than he did drops this year
[1:10:02] Giiino: niners should win, but im not gunna be the guy betting against mahomes in the superbowl
[1:10:05] unknown87644: olleh has been pretty good nice to see
[1:10:13] leamfor: Tactical and Olleh unironically top 3 bot lane this split.
[1:10:15] AzureCatalyst: I'm not going to lie. Olleh and Tactical being the solid botlane was not in my predictions for 2024 LCS
[1:10:19] QuackTheDuck: olleh is a bit underrated tbh
[1:10:37] chemicalV012: olleh is giga underated, people talk about him like hes ass
[1:10:37] Hi_ImPhantomere: but olleh better than IgNar?
[1:10:38] Zebrios: Olleh has had off years, but most supports have.
[1:10:41] najafan: I can't even blame this one on Fudge.
[1:10:43] trueaether: Mask has been less bad than I thought on this team as well
[1:10:44] AzureCatalyst: I think Olleh is more well rounded than Ignar
[1:10:47] xkravianx: Love sorcs/shadowflame orianna
[1:10:49] AzureCatalyst: Olleh has a deeper bag
[1:10:51] najafan: Like, Fudge has had a few questionable decisions.
[1:10:52] HexBlast: is C9 outscaled here?
[1:10:55] unknown87644: core is underwhelming af
[1:10:55] dah777: true lul
[1:10:56] Alderr1: Bro my dog is better than Core right now
[1:10:57] Zebrios: That ain't saying much Monte.
[1:10:59] leamfor: Almost everyone is better than Core right now
[1:11:00] 그렘린1201: olleh deserves a shot in a top 3 team
[1:11:01] Lyghtsaber: yawn and snorejj
[1:11:01] nks93: Thats a lowbar for professional play
[1:11:01] Giiino: core looks pretty average lately
[1:11:02] najafan: But he's been fiiiiiiiiiine.
[1:11:06] QuackTheDuck: Core is so underwhelimng rn
[1:11:06] MellowMelos: Is tactical ever going to be good again?
[1:11:08] Knait0: He stoped to study and went to army few years after, he is playing really well.
[1:11:10] Zelgius: At this point in the game it's just a comp diff yeah, C9 can't walk into IMT
[1:11:11] hotblew1337: @Giiino Purdy is a dawg 2 game winning drives in the playoffs so far ++ Mahomes is a RTP merchant
[1:11:15] kerokerogrips: thats a low standard my man core needs to be taken out to the farm to have a nice retirement
[1:11:17] JeeFour: bUt WoRlD cHaMpIoN cOrEjJ
[1:11:18] hellohihi145: is olleh better than vulcan?
[1:11:19] unknown87644: @Lyghtsaber hahahah
[1:11:21] direpants2: a lot of players are better than core rn
[1:11:43] AntiquusTonitrus_3: agree core has fallen once double left his play has been so inconsistent
[1:11:49] AzureCatalyst: Their only ap damage is udyr's oblivion orb or Vulcan's karma
[1:11:50] Aoyos_: Udyr is dead weight again
[1:11:51] unknown87644: yawn and snorejj ICANT
[1:11:53] silentmilkTTV: most armor rn is boots lol
[1:11:53] butelka_z_odzysku: ivern is clutch here
[1:11:55] Alderr1: he aint Core anymore he is JayJay now
[1:12:02] leamfor: Tactical is sitting at the 3rd highest KDA and the lowest Death Share of all players right now. Tactical making his case for All-Pro 1st team
[1:12:03] AzureCatalyst: Which is pitiful amounts of damage so they aren't incentivized to do anything cept stack armor
[1:12:05] sigmaballs2: olleh has never finished higher than 6th in lcs
[1:12:14] SomeFerretGuy: @sigmaballs2 what
[1:12:14] MadsUlka: Would frozen heart ezreal be good here?
[1:12:15] Giiino: @hotblew1337 no ones a bigger rtp merchant than josh allen tho

[1:12:15] DontBanNida: Imagine if Karma built useful items like Malignance and Horizon Focus
[1:12:17] HexBlast: other teams make udyr look OP but fudge can't do anything
[1:12:21] najafan: Karma isn't even building meaningful AP
[1:12:21] hellohihi145: @sigmaballs2 tf
[1:12:21] unknown87644: @sigmaballs2 huh
[1:12:26] SomeFerretGuy: the fuck you on he was 2 of liquid's 4 wins
[1:12:26] McDumps: Will the LCS ever get away from the awful BO1 series though?
[1:12:29] leamfor: @SomeFerretGuy Homie, Olleh is a 2 time champ
[1:12:32] hotblew1337: @Giiino Thats why Boy at home once again
[1:12:41] hibbjibb: Olleh's also great for content
[1:12:42] Zebrios: Tactical playing like he's got multiple lives.
[1:12:43] najafan: Like, the entire point of why Karma is scary on this patch is because of AP items.
[1:12:45] Sikkibahm: Why does it look like Berseker doesn't do anything this season? Last year he would just suddenly take over later in the game but that doesn't seem to be happening now.
[1:12:48] sigmaballs2: after 2019 forgot to add
[1:12:50] leamfor: @leamfor He got 2nd place with IMT in Summer 2017
[1:12:51] Hi_ImPhantomere: @MonteCristo where would you rank C9 if they were in LCK
[1:13:06] Aoyos_: @najafan And this comp screams AP Karma even as support
[1:13:07] nks93: 12th
[1:13:10] TLegs_: just joined stream - can you give me TLDR on whats wrong with C9?
[1:13:11] McDumps: @Hi_ImPhantomere Challengers.
[1:13:13] AzureCatalyst: @najafan But that's Karma mid or top. Unless you're back in 14.1 you can't really funnel gold into the Karma without support items tbh
[1:13:16] joeshang: @Hi_ImPhantomere 11th
[1:13:18] mrkatsudonnn: is it me or WHY is tactical still in LCS LOL
[1:13:18] unknown87644: KDF or C9 Monte
[1:13:21] QuackTheDuck: @Sikkibahm its the NA soloq slowly sucking away his korean prowess, he needs to go back to korea to recharge
[1:13:23] SomeFerretGuy: @TLegs_ first game diagnosis underway
[1:13:25] JeeFour: @Sikkibahm my opinion, adc role feels stupid weak this season
[1:13:26] butelka_z_odzysku: dont you think blaber and jojo doesnt suit well?
[1:13:28] AzureCatalyst: @TLegs_ He's making his assessment after this game and making the diagnosis later
[1:13:30] killerpineapple1: is hollow worth taking over sunfire?
[1:13:32] Alderr1: TSM looks better this season than C9
[1:13:32] joeshang: @MonteCristo does Fudge clear Kiin
[1:13:33] SomeFerretGuy: @mrkatsudonnn its you
[1:13:33] Zebrios: @unknown87644 KDF would STOMP C9
[1:13:37] Martinmacleod1: udyr bounty is good
[1:13:50] Zelgius: 1h into stream, what's the solution?
[1:13:50] Giiino: give me your homework NERD
[1:13:50] AzureCatalyst: Man wants the answers to the test without the homework being done LUL
[1:13:53] zoneado: lmao
[1:13:54] gdkorps: KEKW
[1:13:56] chemicalV012: ollehs time playing on the froggen deft ggs team obliterated his perceived market cap
[1:13:57] MellowMelos: xdd
[1:13:58] HexBlast: quick chatgpt an answer LUL
[1:13:59] CoveredPillow: can you just look into the future and tell me the answer already
[1:14:00] dah777: h-h-homework monkaS
[1:14:01] najafan: @AzureCatalyst Sure! But you take what you can get here. Enchanters are strong atm, but I don't think Karma is the best choice if we just want an enchanter.
[1:14:02] Voltiate: Children these days are so impatient
[1:14:02] sigmaballs2: this game is boring as fuck
[1:14:02] silentmilkTTV: my dog ate cloud 9
[1:14:05] TLegs_: wtf? youre the very salty one here... not sure why
[1:14:05] MadsUlka: What went wrong in this game?
[1:14:05] unknown87644: ask chatgpt
[1:14:08] FollowTheBloodtrail: Is it just me or is C9 spending a lot of time on their own half of the map and not pushing into IMT's side for a team that is technically ahead?
[1:14:11] NicOnTwitch: c9 is the last super team i thought would fail
[1:14:16] trueaether: C9 vs BRO would be a 180 minute 3 game series I think
[1:14:16] guillefeijo14: lmao
[1:14:17] najafan: Why pick Karma if you don't want AP Karma is all.
[1:14:19] Kanbrax: can we copy half the homework just to pass the exam? Kappa

[1:14:26] HexBlast: im gonna steal your answer tomorrow morning though and look very smart
[1:14:27] guillefeijo14: you gotta start calling it research streams
[1:14:28] Aoyos_: @FollowTheBloodtrail They apply no pressure after taking side towers
[1:14:29] Zebrios: @trueaether Double-forfeit
[1:14:30] McDumps: 30 minute game, 1 kill so far. Standard.
[1:14:34] ace_alchemist: Corpa
[1:14:35] Knait0: @Kanbrax Yeah dude, and leave karma to combine with Ez LUL
[1:14:36] nohandss15: hi monte and chat
[1:14:44] AntiquusTonitrus_3: simpale answer C9 is in NA and they are a minor region with money
[1:14:46] carnivalnights: I need these answers so Reddit can downvote me later and tell me why I'm wrong and why LCS is great.
[1:14:47] AzureCatalyst: @najafan It felt more like a takeaway pick than something that C9 really wanted to play. I don't see Jojo as a Karma mid player TBH
[1:14:47] LordParasit: @montecristo is the double ad even important imt have no tank who can make ise of that fact, noone builds extra armor yet either.
[1:14:50] CoveredPillow: can you make it into a tiktok so I don't have to pay attention for too long
[1:14:51] chemicalV012: The performance of Cloud9 (C9) in the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) can fluctuate for various reasons, and stating that they are categorically "bad" might not accurately reflect the complexities of competitive League of Legends. Teams can have periods of underperformance due to several factors, including but not limited to:
[1:14:52] killerpineapple1: @najafan was milio banned this game? i missed draft
[1:14:53] JeeFour: Corpa subscribe and turn on notifications while you over there
[1:14:53] oODemonPandaOo: @MonteCristo thoughts on rekkles performance so far on t1 academy?
[1:14:54] 그렘린1201: it would of been sick to see Olleh on C9 with a beast like Berserker olleh really deserves a shot on a top team
[1:14:59] chemicalV012: Roster Changes: Frequent changes in the team's lineup can disrupt synergy and communication, which are crucial for success in competitive League of Legends.  Coaching and Strategy: The coaching staff's approach to training, strategy formulation, and in-game decision-making can significantly impact a team's performance. Misalignments or ineffective strategies can lead to poor results.  Player Performance: Individual player performance can vary due to personal issues, health, motivation, or ad
[1:15:01] scoobysnacksac: Watch the stream and support LFN like the rest of us
[1:15:06] c9islife: I think repeared should be c9s coach again. rule with an iron fist I say
[1:15:12] SomeFerretGuy: please do not write an essay
[1:15:12] Helmzee: I think so far from this game, itemization and priority on objectives just seems off from C9
[1:15:20] najafan: @AzureCatalyst I mean, that's fair, but that just speaks to bigger problems in their draft, no?
[1:15:22] leamfor: @MonteCristo Can we watch the FLY games, too?
[1:15:23] FollowTheBloodtrail: @Aoyos_ Thats what I think. Like every single lane seems like they push to halfway and then back off, which i get for doing weakside, but all three lanes cant be weakside
[1:15:27] NicOnTwitch: @c9islife you think that's the issue, too many egos?
[1:15:29] Hi_ImPhantomere: was worlds 2015 the last world championship that monte casted in?
[1:15:29] dah777: how does trist almost have 3k hp? LUL
[1:15:33] HexBlast: maybe not reapered but I've been unimpressed by Mithy's tenure, feels like the team has underperformed
[1:15:37] DixMX: do you think Rekkles could save C9? Kappa
[1:15:37] guillefeijo14: @c9islife \BASED
[1:15:41] KianSucks: frozen heart Ezreal angle?
[1:15:46] joeshang: @MonteCristo who is most likely to win the org contest in the esports world cup
[1:15:48] leamfor: Ty @MonteCristo
[1:15:48] Zebrios: jojo 0 dmg
[1:15:48] QuackTheDuck: its because Zven was carrying C9 all along, nobody is saying it so I said it, Zven was the glue that c9 needed to scapegoat
[1:15:54] Komarimasita: yessss i cant wait for jdg lng
[1:15:54] trueaether: Ivern is so broken
[1:15:56] Clyde1500: monte can only feed us so much trash
[1:15:56] canyon_55: that flash is so grief
[1:15:59] Zelgius: Another bad flash from Jojo, geez
[1:16:01] PickKarma: FlyQuest waiting room
[1:16:02] Ikancast: PauseChamp
[1:16:03] SomeFerretGuy: cristoLCS cristoRACCOON
[1:16:04] Aoyos_: @FollowTheBloodtrail C9 had to send 4 people to feel confident enough to get T2 top, they're playing very scared
[1:16:05] HexBlast: C9 has to work sooooo hard for kills
[1:16:06] Amosdragon: So today is racoon pleasing day
[1:16:12] kerokerogrips: rap god captain flowers
[1:16:13] c9islife: who would have known ememes was the glue of c9
[1:16:16] MrWooody: jojo flash was interesting
[1:16:19] Giiino: jojo???
[1:16:19] wadswootie: Anyone else think c9 is the most has the most arrogant cocky smug players? In so glad they have lost 3 in a row
[1:16:22] FollowTheBloodtrail: @najafan @najafan I think that if they cant 131, then they need to play on 2 lanes and 41 and apply pressure as 4 no?
[1:16:22] chemicalV012: jojo not insecting and still commiting flash r aaaaaaaaaaa
[1:16:23] roivas1: 1 kill 30 minutes ResidentSleeper
[1:16:23] McDumps: Why was Mask so far up?!
[1:16:32] mrkatsudonnn: watch lcs for today. FLY seems good this split
[1:16:32] butelka_z_odzysku: jojo knew they losing
[1:16:32] SomeFerretGuy: @wadswootie 4
[1:16:33] LunacyCA: @wadswootie the jojo effect
[1:16:34] Lyghtsaber: @c9islife uh or zven holding zerkers hand
[1:16:36] PickKarma: That was the flash of a person playing a 30 minute one kill game
[1:16:39] trueaether: i'm starting to think that somehow Zven was shotcalling C9 last year
[1:16:45] AzureCatalyst: @najafan I think Mithy isn't a really good draft coach if he's their coach this season. I think Maxwaldo was lowkey underrated with some of his drafts last year. Rigby, Duffman, and a toin of their positional coaches leaving does not bode well to Mithy being able to lead a late season turnaround
[1:16:50] JeeFour: damn, ori ivern bard, just cant chase that
[1:16:55] sigmaballs2: ofc c9 is cocky those players have been winning for so long
[1:17:02] McDumps: Their objective sense is way off.
[1:17:04] c9islife: @lyghtsaber no I know it’s just funny to say emenes
[1:17:06] maletroll: serpents fang isnt enough for teams like this, needs to be more options for anti-shield items
[1:17:12] QuackTheDuck: the drake timer ignored by the LCS and LEC as well
[1:17:23] unknown87644: ignored by LCS broadcast too!

[1:17:29] Zebrios: Ori sees him around the corner
[1:17:31] sexualeagle: Maybe they also don't have the drake timer
[1:17:31] Zelgius: Mask should never walk up without vision
[1:17:32] yestheryak: they removed timer from broadcast so we can better align our viewing experience with the player's gameplans
[1:17:44] MellowMelos: wait doesnt armao see jojo there?
[1:17:50] AzureCatalyst: Armao should be able to spot the tristana during the rotation to wolf camp no?
[1:17:52] Aoyos_: IMT overstimated C9's competency
[1:18:03] Ikancast: just a bit impatient
[1:18:04] DankWizard420: he has blue ward PepeLaugh
[1:18:07] wadswootie: What was Amaros previous name?
[1:18:13] SomeFerretGuy: grig
[1:18:16] chemicalV012: @maletroll theyre never adding more antishield items, grevious wounds has been a balance issue since 2010
[1:18:19] wadswootie: Ah yes
[1:18:20] SomeFerretGuy: grigne
[1:18:22] LunacyCA: @wadswootie ginger
[1:18:24] JeeFour: @wadswootie grig
[1:18:25] AzureCatalyst: I thought WAIT
[1:18:27] AzureCatalyst: ARMAO IS GRIGNE
[1:18:27] XLOftw: ok guys g2g to sleep, will watch the vods tomorrow :D gl Monte & chattt
[1:18:40] Knait0: You're going mad after the fly game for sure LUL
[1:18:41] QuackTheDuck: yeah but IMT doesnt do baron that fast right?
[1:18:42] HexBlast: secret agent jojo
[1:18:46] AzureCatalyst: Oh my god that's a blast from the past
[1:18:48] sigmaballs2: grigne had to change name cause of racism
[1:19:06] AzureCatalyst: Grigne on TSM and then I completely forgot about him
[1:19:10] purpledino: but that comp does a slow baron
[1:19:13] Zerschneiden: jojo fucked that up tho
[1:19:18] Zebrios: Castle's flash is kinda grief too
[1:19:26] Aoyos_: He got hit by Ivern Q
[1:19:26] JeeFour: @AzureCatalyst he changed his name the very next season
[1:19:41] Aoyos_: That's why Aatrox jumps in, it's the Q follow up ability
[1:19:46] hero_endz: What do you think of G2 this year 🤔
[1:19:50] Zerschneiden: jojo should've w'd into an R back into tower
[1:19:51] AzureCatalyst: @JeeFour I also stopped watching Pro league around that time. I followed Monte to Overwatch TBH
[1:19:57] wadswootie: Anyone else think lck has byfar the best cast crew? From chronicler atlas, to aux and wolf also they had papasmithy the only competition was deficio from eu
[1:20:00] LordParasit: Even a kill is just 1 for 1
[1:20:23] SomeFerretGuy: do you also want to ask our opinion on whether water is wet
[1:20:26] chemicalV012: atlas' voice AYAYA
[1:20:37] purpledino: @montecristo  isn’t their comp really slow at doing baron ?
[1:20:40] wadswootie: How was grigne racist?
[1:20:50] guy_in_chat_says: he hasn’t played badly but like it’s gotta be Vulcan at this point right
[1:20:56] BigCohones: @wadswootie rearrange the letters...
[1:20:56] joeshang: @wadswootie nah
[1:20:58] AzureCatalyst: G2 has been underwhelming this year to say the least
[1:20:58] chemicalV012: anagram
[1:21:01] DanielFromLA: @wadswootie to me they are the best in all of LoL
[1:21:13] Helmzee: @wadswootie it's an anagram for a racist word
[1:21:17] AzureCatalyst: Oo What are you snacking on? peepoFat
[1:21:20] wadswootie: Ah thanks
[1:21:20] teddylear: @montecristo I don't get why more teams don't play ivern... Seems so good in so many comps
[1:21:21] pandagrog: @joeshang LEC is best
[1:21:24] QuackTheDuck: i hear food what is it?
[1:21:27] Aoyos_: Chat what's Bard's rune
[1:21:27] Zebrios: Ivern carrying
[1:21:33] joeshang: @pandagrog LJL best
[1:21:49] mrkatsudonnn: Is double adc comps really THAT good?
[1:21:57] AzureCatalyst: Oh wow
[1:21:58] pandagrog: @joeshang If were doing this its def CBLOL then
[1:21:59] myosotismenot: peepoFat
[1:22:00] Zelgius: Jojo KEKW
[1:22:00] Zebrios: Again
[1:22:02] AzureCatalyst: Looking at that
[1:22:06] SomeFerretGuy: warded YEP
[1:22:06] DankWizard420: LUL
[1:22:09] dah777: peepoFat ah yes, my emote
[1:22:11] Ikancast: olleh was popping off
[1:22:13] joeshang: @pandagrog all of them clears lck
[1:22:18] AzureCatalyst: I don't think Tristana can actually jump out of bard ulti without like instant reactions
[1:22:22] Zebrios: Jojo tried to buffer again
[1:22:25] najafan: Realized that it wasn't Bufferable I guess.
[1:22:25] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:22:26] AzureCatalyst: Like the startup animation might be too slow
[1:22:29] pandagrog: @joeshang BASED
[1:22:29] wadswootie: Who is good in lec besides quickshot who doesn't cast anymore... all the best ones don't cast anymore
[1:22:31] QuackTheDuck: great play by olleh
[1:22:36] OGCaptainCrunch: its not  bufferable
[1:22:40] Neumonyx: you called it, Olleh making plays
[1:22:44] JeeFour: can someone remind me, what was the trist buffer/bard ult convo earlier?
[1:22:47] Aoyos_: @AzureCatalyst He can actually jump out of that bard ult if he used W first instead of right clicking to walk
[1:22:50] chemicalV012: @mrkatsudonnn previous items, hell yes it was, armor didnt exist to adc's post ldr, new items appear to have toned late game adc damaged down alot
[1:22:59] AzureCatalyst: @Aoyos_ Ah that might be it
[1:23:05] Warzard908: @wadswootie Medi ig dagda is dope too
[1:23:09] AzureCatalyst: Yeah but it seems like a really tight squeeze in terms of reacting to the bard ulti
[1:23:17] MrFillz: I'd like to see olleh on C9, has he ever been on a top team?
[1:23:17] Warzard908: I like hysterics as well
[1:23:32] Aoyos_: @AzureCatalyst That bard ult is at a longer distance so there's more than enough time to W out if you do it right away, longer travel time
[1:23:32] wadswootie: Yeah hysterics is good
[1:23:36] QuackTheDuck: @Aoyos_ you cant buffer it
[1:23:36] PapaSmithy: you have to flash
[1:23:37] PapaSmithy: no other option
[1:23:41] BigCohones: nor should it be bufferable. its a statis not a stun/root
[1:23:41] PapaSmithy: (he didnt have it)
[1:23:49] Zebrios: Brother Olleh giving it back
[1:23:53] teddylear: @mrfillz Old IMT and TL back in the day
[1:24:04] ADrugge: Olleh is the duality of support.
[1:24:05] brandonstoasts: hi papa hope ur doing well :D
[1:24:06] McDumps: @PapaSmithy May I please have a cool fact of league knowledge?
[1:24:13] Blackreignxxx: that failed dive vs sr ruin c9?
[1:24:13] SomeFerretGuy: @MrFillz literally won 2 lcs with doublelift
[1:24:23] PapaSmithy: @McDumps IMT has two supports who played with Doublelift at an international event on their roster!
[1:24:24] SomeFerretGuy: Madge this olleh erasure will not stand
[1:24:34] McDumps: @PapaSmithy Thank you sir.
[1:24:41] teddylear: The olleh story of quitting cigs right before playoffs and then losing is still one of the funniest esports stories to me
[1:24:46] Aoyos_: @QuackTheDuck The buffer argument is bs on that bard ult, you can W out if you do it right away instead of right clicking to walk like Jojo did. Even with how Jojo did it all wrong he only got caught at the edge of the Bard ult so if he uses rocket jump right away he gets out
[1:24:47] AzureCatalyst: Wow tactical is really positioning on the edge of this fight.
[1:24:48] wadswootie: Papa you are the best caster league ever had!!!
[1:24:49] Helmzee: I think Trist is overvalued by pro teams in mid, feel like Varus flexed mid and a different adc or even an ap carry bot like Ziggs is better here
[1:24:56] AzureCatalyst: Like he's constantly outputting damage on the right targets
[1:24:56] pillowcat123456: i cba with watching lcs anymore but can someone spoonfeed me why c9 is stinking it up rn?
[1:25:02] SomeFerretGuy: no
[1:25:03] Zebrios: 4v5 and ends in a 1v1
[1:25:05] AzureCatalyst: Like watch his target selection with his q's
[1:25:06] Zebrios: How
[1:25:07] SomeFerretGuy: we can't we're learning it
[1:25:07] Double_Hitt: Was Olleh the support who didnt play at msi or was that someone else
[1:25:10] professor_wormbog_: It seems like he just sticks so hard to one person
[1:25:12] AzureCatalyst: It's actually impressive how fast he's changing his priorities
[1:25:15] SomeFerretGuy: @Double_Hitt yes
[1:25:21] l1ght0heav3n: Blaber is not a rell player anyone with a brain knows that
[1:25:25] ADrugge: Bad Blabber play or good spacing from IMT?
[1:25:26] wubbzk: is it just me or is jojo doing 0 dmg
[1:25:33] najafan: @pillowcat123456 We're figuring it out rn. At least some of it seems to be draft.
[1:25:40] DanielFromLA: literally the worse time to cut an addiction
[1:25:40] mrkatsudonnn: I guess he ran it down at playoff 😂😂
[1:25:42] DilfZaddy: probs had a migraine all game lmao
[1:25:49] SomeFerretGuy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk0UmvknB3E&t=1848s
[1:25:49] Helmzee: @najafan Draft and itemization
[1:25:55] SomeFerretGuy: here's SI episode
[1:26:01] hotblew1337: @DanielFromLA The best time to cut an addiction is tomorrow.
[1:26:03] MrFillz: @someferretguy but was it him winning the games or just done run it and you win. I think he can do so much more on a team like C9
[1:26:03] chemicalV012: chat why does spear stack
[1:26:12] chemicalV012: what it do
[1:26:15] teddylear: The real question... Does Jack o
[1:26:16] AzureCatalyst: Also watch this Ezreal game then watch the Mad Koi Ezreal from game 2 and it's looking like 2 different champions
[1:26:19] SomeFerretGuy: it was double and olleh bodying the bot lane
[1:26:38] AzureCatalyst: Also don't forget aobut Xmithie
[1:26:39] DanielFromLA: @hotblew1337 true but in this case, cigarettes can help with stress albeit not a a healthy habit lmao
[1:26:43] AzureCatalyst: Xmithie my man was there in the botlane too!
[1:26:50] SomeFerretGuy: not false KEKHeim
[1:26:54] AzureCatalyst: wait
[1:26:59] AzureCatalyst: You don't get stasis'd again
[1:27:01] AzureCatalyst: if you get bard uylted
[1:27:04] trinzik2: correct
[1:27:07] Jeffp2662: yeah stasis doesnt hit you
[1:27:09] PapaSmithy: nah u can't be effected by any buff or debuf
[1:27:10] Juicypika: yep
[1:27:11] AzureCatalyst: That makes sense cool
[1:27:11] PapaSmithy: in stasis
[1:27:12] Aoyos_: Yeah always worked that way
[1:27:13] JeeFour: of course, you are untargetable
[1:27:16] HexBlast: can't affect a stasis champ
[1:27:19] SomeFerretGuy: 5head
[1:27:20] MissingMatter: Ult can't hit him because he's in stasis.
[1:27:25] wadswootie: I know olleh but who else supported doublelift on imt?

[1:27:40] QuackTheDuck: monkaHmm if you stasis a stasis you cant be stasis if you are in stasis
[1:27:40] leamfor: @wadswootie DL was never on IMT.
[1:27:41] Aoyos_: It's an interaction you'll only see if you spam Bard
[1:28:02] JeeFour: taht varus Q dmg, no armor on aatrox
[1:28:02] LordParasit: @montecristo why is fudge building literally o dmg all hes offeribg is tankyness no wonder theyve dmg problems
[1:28:15] AzureCatalyst: Holy tactical is pumping damage
[1:28:20] enreves: Tank Udyr being useless as always
[1:28:31] SomeFerretGuy: tactical haters are actually blind, my boy edward ra has had a glow up
[1:28:35] Zebrios: Flowers would make a good auctioneer
[1:28:37] stalff: fudge has looked horrible this year
[1:28:48] AzureCatalyst: If he hits 2 more q's there I think that's probably a world where he gets a triple or quadra there
[1:28:52] chemicalV012: tabis vs the world
[1:29:02] yestheryak: @SomeFerretGuy homie he just missed 45 qs
[1:29:02] Jeffp2662: if castle had frozen heart he'd be so much more useful diving on trist
[1:29:08] trueaether: @AzureCatalyst it feels like he misses a ton of q's this game honestly
[1:29:10] wadswootie: Who else supported doubleloft that is on imt now is what I meant
[1:29:20] Voltiate: Flowers cooking, yet again
[1:29:21] HexBlast: karma speeds up the team?
[1:29:22] trueaether: particularly free ones
[1:29:22] AzureCatalyst: @trueaether Yeah but he's like so close to just going absolutely insane on ezreal
[1:29:30] JeeFour: yeah, ori ivern bard, you can't walk at that, they make good space
[1:29:31] trinzik2: the mystic shots flyin, nobody on c9 dyin
[1:29:31] AzureCatalyst: Like he's playing way closer and more aggro than alot of western ezreals
[1:29:35] chemicalV012: why does aatrox not have fh manamune smh
[1:29:38] QuackTheDuck: well you can speed people up with karma
[1:29:39] LordParasit: Udyr needs liandry to be a thread @montecristo hes just a meatbag at this point
[1:29:41] Zelgius: If Karma dies C9 can't fight without a big hp advantage
[1:29:46] killerpineapple1: i think its mostly the draft right there tank is tank thought lifesteal but i mean a thorn on aatrox aint the worst thing into this comp
[1:29:56] AzureCatalyst: Like he's comparable to like Carzzy last year
[1:30:01] catast999: this rage baron LUL
[1:30:03] trueaether: That's true
[1:30:06] AzureCatalyst: I'm reasonably impressed with his ezreal mechanics and damage foresight
[1:30:07] DilfZaddy: flowers sounds like an LOL auctioneer
[1:30:18] SomeFerretGuy: why did blaber go in KEKHeim
[1:30:21] killerpineapple1: blabbberrrrr
[1:30:29] Zebrios: Jojo gets shrekt
[1:30:34] trueaether: this botlane is probably top half, which no one would have thought pre-split
[1:30:35] McDumps: Castle had a great flank.
[1:30:39] Reindeeers: Honestly imo Berserker > Guma and Ruler. I think he just had a bad week and come worlds will be back into championship form.
[1:30:43] mjoll_the_hotness: is c9 getting the overhype curse or what
[1:30:44] DanielFromLA: ori ult
[1:30:44] LilGimli: they jsut have no damage 30m+ in, bereserkers lethality, so jojos the only damage into mountain soul and shields
[1:30:48] Zebrios: That shockwave was clutch
[1:30:51] chemicalV012: jojo outplayed by the d key
[1:30:52] wadswootie: Blaber is a smug arrogant person can't stand him
[1:30:52] killerpineapple1: getting ori comboed
[1:30:54] AzureCatalyst: @Reindeeers Are you serious?
[1:30:58] tylertft: Theres just not enough damage or engag from this C9 comp when they aren't giga far ahead
[1:31:04] MellowMelos: cant believe jojo doesnt build lord doms third this game
[1:31:04] Aoyos_: The only way for C9 to play fights was for Blaber to perma hunt for flanks while Fudge plays frontline, they can't play any fight front to back
[1:31:06] AzureCatalyst: Because Berserker being better than ruler is a insane take
[1:31:11] strogi50: he ran into Ori ball
[1:31:12] najafan: tbh, the game was still winnable even with soul. Hard af, but possible.
[1:31:16] kerokerogrips: probably thought he could hands diff
[1:31:17] najafan: The baron was just an int.
[1:31:17] JeeFour: omg actually good shockwave, i thought he was out of it
[1:31:18] HexBlast: C9 look mental boom starting baron there
[1:31:18] Zelgius: Rough game for Jojo
[1:31:22] enreves: Throwjopyun PepeLaugh
[1:31:22] DankWizard420: exhaust vs no exhaust YEP
[1:31:22] rilsolo: i thought that baron solo'd jojo didn't see the shockwave LuL
[1:31:25] Jeffp2662: rocket jumps towards baron and then just walks into ori ult
[1:31:26] wadswootie: So it's jojo and fudge and berserker c9 just makes people toxic I guess
[1:31:31] mjoll_the_hotness: little bird told me that naram is back on the menu in c9 games
[1:31:34] LordParasit: Id say with 2 fulltanks and 2 adc u need to go onhit varus aswell vs shields
[1:31:40] Knait0: Saving flash for next game YEP
[1:31:44] Emilytacular: wow
[1:31:52] Aoyos_: Also after C9 took T2 top and bottom they never bothered to apply sidelane pressure ever again, never went past their half of the map
[1:31:54] joeshang: Jojo didnt think Mask was capable of pressing R
[1:31:54] QuackTheDuck: Saving flash for spring finals YEP
[1:32:07] DanielFromLA: @MonteCristo do you hot/chicken wings and if so, what flavor
[1:32:09] killerpineapple1: theres too many dick swingers on C9 now not enough i dont think they have anyone that keeps there cool
[1:32:11] fIuffee: C9 played their hearts out and proved that they were the better team. The only reason they lost is due to either really bad luck or matchfixing unfortunately
[1:32:12] McDumps: That was a weird team comp.
[1:32:13] DankWizard420: @LordParasit proplayers and being allergic to going the superior varus build, ap YEP
[1:32:16] muni20001: YEP
[1:32:25] killerpineapple1: just from how there personality's feel from what we seen of em
[1:32:31] AzureCatalyst: Lemon Pepper Chicken Wings are dope
[1:32:31] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:32:32] SomeFerretGuy: nashville hot >buffalo
[1:32:33] chemicalV012: jojo personally carrying tsm2.0 to playoffs
[1:32:34] QuackTheDuck: wow Fudge is so tall
[1:32:36] nks93: @fIuffee Dont forget bad draft, not the player's fault
[1:32:36] DanielFromLA: @MonteCristo no lemon pepper?
[1:32:41] fIuffee: yup!
[1:32:42] joeshang: @MonteCristo what is the most prestigious chicken wing flavour
[1:32:43] najafan: @fIuffee Very true
[1:32:45] professor_wormbog_: Seems like that's been a history with Jojo. He can look really good, but sometimes it's super rough.
[1:32:47] ponkzy: is NA a league in shambles
[1:32:57] Voltiate: lemon pepper wet or dry?
[1:32:57] JeeFour: @MonteCristo re:super weeks, is it worth trading competitive integrity for artificial tension for viewers?
[1:33:02] OceanLegacy: mango habanero
[1:33:04] McDumps: Habanero Mango.
[1:33:05] Zerschneiden: c9 just following the script, so they can have a comeback story
[1:33:05] Helmzee: Garlic Parmesan very good too
[1:33:07] amaxlegit: sweet chili
[1:33:07] soupdog55: wingstop has some KBBQ wings that slap
[1:33:11] Knait0: Conclusion?
[1:33:11] McDumps: @OceanLegacy Ayyyy.
[1:33:15] NitroDavid: ok so homework time, whats wrong with C9?
[1:33:18] fIuffee: I really thought monte was vegan
[1:33:23] OceanLegacy: @McDumps I see you
[1:33:24] J__Carson: garlic parm is pretty solid
[1:33:27] enreves: oh no PepeLaugh
[1:33:28] trueaether: I fucking love Flyquest
[1:33:28] unknown87644: ranch or blue cheese with wings tho @MonteCristo
[1:33:29] 1DeepBlue: these get increasingly painful to watch
[1:33:29] SomeFerretGuy: @fIuffee no you did not
[1:33:33] chemicalV012: @MonteCristo did korea took the white out of you? the only king of chicken is lemon pepper
[1:33:33] fIuffee: no I didn't
[1:33:35] QuackTheDuck: here we go
[1:33:35] ADrugge: We only did half the homework guys, relax.
[1:33:38] SomeFerretGuy: how many times has motne talked about his smoked meats
[1:33:40] DilfZaddy: C9 awkward when their identity is winning and swag and they start not performing lol
[1:33:42] SomeFerretGuy: weirdChamp
[1:33:43] hellohihi145: Monte why no closing analysis for c9? don’t wanna do mithys work for gimB
[1:33:45] QuackTheDuck: C9 vs basically EU
[1:33:52] Nytrodark: lol
[1:33:56] fIuffee: I thought it was vegan smoked meat 😔
[1:34:03] PoBeaver: Monte was the dried chicken sandwiches for our streaming pleasure
[1:34:05] chemicalV012: type a coherent sentence in twitch chat challenge
[1:34:07] mjoll_the_hotness: glad bwipo is back hes always been fun player to watch
[1:34:15] DanielFromLA: @MonteCristo what do you think of max waldo when he coached c9?
[1:34:16] SomeFerretGuy: haha guy in the crowd happy birthday your team loses
[1:34:16] enreves: C9 ruined that mans bday
[1:34:21] enreves: D:
[1:34:26] AzureCatalyst: STOP ASKIGN FOR HIS HOMEWORK
[1:34:29] PickKarma: XD
[1:34:30] AzureCatalyst: HE NEEDS TO FINISH IT BEFORE WE CAN COPY
[1:34:38] LordParasit: I cant get over udyrs building frozenfist item with no benefit to the champ
[1:34:44] JuCiEe19: have you seen the TL game yet
[1:34:48] SomeFerretGuy: no
[1:34:51] Serberen: but i want tconcloode
[1:34:54] DankWizard420: so what you're saying is draft gap YEP
[1:34:56] AzureCatalyst: Are the drafts the problem in this game or was the draft servicable and the play was the issue?
[1:34:57] najafan: Bad draft and questionable choice of items given the comp
[1:34:58] Neumonyx: Would you say Olleh was MVP or who would get it for last match?
[1:35:06] killerpineapple1: i think jojo was actually a nerf to C9 emense to me was always the rational player
[1:35:06] PapaSmithy: porti KEKW
[1:35:13] enreves: The eu topside in Fly has been fire
[1:35:22] najafan: Well, not a *bad* draft.
[1:35:23] killerpineapple1: now they just got essential 4 kids trying to sort out some sorta shit
[1:35:25] Helmzee: I feel like C9's itemization is not talked about enough. There are a lot of items the players go that just don't make sense given the games
[1:35:27] najafan: A questionable draft.
[1:35:27] AzureCatalyst: Wait is Hai doing draft now? I thought he was just their team manager/midlane sub
[1:35:28] J__Carson: think they should be playing aggressive drafts to get advantages with the skill but there just playing the slowest of any teams right know
[1:35:31] unknown87644: y does bwipo always hover kaisa?
[1:35:32] Sjkaev: oh hai is coaching? Pog
[1:35:33] trinzik2: hais a coach for c9 or flyquest? just tuned in
[1:35:35] IrishProphet: Peak C9 Hai shot calling was so sick
[1:35:36] AzureCatalyst: Is mithy not doing draft anymore or am I insane?
[1:35:39] Helmzee: Fudge is also just not good at Udyr
[1:35:45] Aoyos_: Weird lane assignments, item builds that don't help their comp, bad teamfight set ups and they seemingly forgot about objective timers (though IMT did too)
[1:35:55] SomeFerretGuy: @unknown87644 maybe its a shout out to when he started in lec as a bot laner
[1:35:55] strogi50: Bwipo hovers Kaisa for his gf
[1:36:03] SomeFerretGuy: oh
[1:36:06] eatluxury: any super bowl plans monte?
[1:36:10] leamfor: PepeLaugh
[1:36:19] LordParasit: This game it wad berserker on a pokechamp qho cant bail out the team ob their bad play
[1:36:33] Tpro83: Skippable Super Bowl honestly
[1:36:40] HexBlast: C9 looks like they can't play without Berserker on a hyper carry
[1:36:41] Zerschneiden: @Tpro83 bruh no way
[1:36:45] trinzik2: no lamar gg
[1:36:55] MissingMatter: I'm going to forget when it's on, just like the last couple years.
[1:37:00] Adanion: wait, the Super bowl is today?
[1:37:04] ADrugge: Bwipo hovers Kaisa for his GF
[1:37:05] Tpro83: @Zerschneiden bruv, yeah Hwei
[1:37:05] eatluxury: @Adanion next week
[1:37:12] JeeFour: wtf this graphic LMAO
[1:37:12] BigCohones: why do you live in Korea instead of USA?
[1:37:14] l1ght0heav3n: @hexblast doesn’t help when top is useless every game and blaber isn’t being given champs that can fight a lot
[1:37:14] OceanLegacy: bwipo always hovers kaisa
[1:37:23] Knait0: fp kaisa, enemy gets xayah rakan its 2023 all over again
[1:37:25] enreves: mid diff
[1:37:26] DilfZaddy: why do all the player pictures look like they’re models for Target?

[1:37:36] Zerschneiden: @Tpro83 gonna be a banger, chiefs in postseason mode and niners be nining
[1:37:38] AzureCatalyst: We need to bring Twitch Prime to MonteCristo signs to LCS for the LFN Sign Bounty LOL
[1:37:42] Aoyos_: @MonteCristo Notice the infographics are all on white backgrounds after the layoffs
[1:37:56] AzureCatalyst: Can I grab a couple of you guys to come to the Riot Studio next Saturday for that LOL
[1:37:58] rilsolo: oh this is the tragic bot laning monkaS
[1:37:58] HexBlast: lucian....
[1:38:01] mjoll_the_hotness: is zven nielsen part of c9 crew still
[1:38:03] killerpineapple1: and he does it again XD
[1:38:03] DanielFromLA: @MonteCristo did you see captain flowers call out caedrel during the broadcast?
[1:38:05] Voltiate: Lucian xD
[1:38:14] idonkare: NA Lucian
[1:38:16] DankWizard420: he got dragon? oh..wait YEP
[1:38:24] AzureCatalyst: @DanielFromLA He doesn't watch the games live
[1:38:28] Jeffp2662: seemed like the drag steal tilted blabber
[1:38:28] najafan: @AzureCatalyst At least one needs to be a cute asian girl for it to be effective.
[1:38:30] AzureCatalyst: So he might not have seen it
[1:38:33] Tpro83: @Zerschneiden Chiefs getting their script luck and Niners are alright. Just feels like refs will bail chiefs out.
[1:38:36] McDumps: @DanielFromLA What did he say?!
[1:38:37] SomeFerretGuy: brungle
[1:38:38] AzureCatalyst: @najafan I can bring a cute Asian Girl xdd
[1:38:41] PickKarma: Inspired my goat
[1:38:44] DankWizard420: brand GIGACHAD
[1:38:44] sorcaaa: '
[1:38:46] eatluxury: i would cry if i had to play rell this game
[1:38:50] Aoyos_: Papa bringing the Brand home
[1:38:51] najafan: lmao
[1:38:52] ponkzy: vi not good on this patch?
[1:38:56] Tpro83: AAron... AAtrox...
[1:38:57] sorcaaa: Is it wront o rolla joint with filter?
[1:38:58] DankWizard420: wait why is brand jungle good? Susge
[1:39:00] frexyseek: anyone else sick of aatroX?
[1:39:01] zen__cloud: lucian should be 0-7 in LCS but yeon got carried to a win
[1:39:06] Helmzee: FLY comp is miles better
[1:39:08] wadswootie: Why is twitch more popular than youtube live? Twitch sends to sick so much!!
[1:39:08] trinzik2: brand jg is very good
[1:39:11] eatluxury: @frexyseek insane clear, good teamfight
[1:39:16] AzureCatalyst: Ew Lucian into Brand Ori Varus sounds like hell
[1:39:21] Tpro83: I think Monte will enjoy this one
[1:39:24] eatluxury: oh wrong reply
[1:39:28] AzureCatalyst: Brand and ori and varus just outrange the lucian or nuke him once he gets into range
[1:39:31] lucashowmuchpain: Id hate to play brand with this mid top matchup
[1:39:35] SomeFerretGuy: @DankWizard420 https://twitter.com/Spideraxe30/status/1714026767860596898
[1:39:43] mjoll_the_hotness: yeah lucian seems like asking to get cc'd
[1:39:51] MrFillz: Stare
[1:40:13] DankWizard420: @SomeFerretGuy oh so that got pushed, not played in like 7months, still play him support YEP
[1:40:14] leamfor: Inspired trying to rizz me up or what
[1:40:14] killerpineapple1: the brand just clears so much better than the rell
[1:40:15] AzureCatalyst: Only complaint I have about Fly's comp is the double AP mid which makes the rell and neeko go double Merc treads which means that Varus ulti loses value and good targets
[1:40:22] mjoll_the_hotness: gonna be backline tickler lucian
[1:40:23] killerpineapple1: also easy to invade
[1:40:27] Aoyos_: @SomeFerretGuy Over time he's gotten a lot of buffs vs monsters and the last set of buffs finally made players turn to him
[1:40:30] AzureCatalyst: Double AP mid jungle*
[1:40:31] LordParasit: @montecristo ksante counters their whole comp ult lucian = gg
[1:40:41] wadswootie: You can't go back on twitch you can't go double speed. You are maxed at 720p
[1:40:42] killerpineapple1: brand just slapps rell
[1:40:48] lucashowmuchpain: i dont know who gets early push in this top matchup chat?
[1:40:57] AzureCatalyst: @LordParasit If Ksante is close enough to Lucian then I hope Berserker gets deported
[1:41:07] AzureCatalyst: Legit if he's that close to the ksante he deserves to get shot
[1:41:08] catast999: oh no this game PepeLaugh
[1:41:10] AzureCatalyst: In game
[1:41:16] wadswootie: Yes deport Berserker !!
[1:41:19] trueaether: @AzureCatalyst only in LCS
[1:41:22] hellohihi145: if they use the vc it is hard to get to loseian I agree
[1:41:23] McDumps: @AzureCatalyst Preach
[1:41:28] DankWizard420: @Aoyos_ just happy whatever patch it was they made it possible for his ult to bounce off yourself LUL
[1:41:28] hellohihi145: cc*
[1:41:34] Aoyos_: If this was LCK you'd see C9 control vision in order to go for flank after flank
[1:41:34] Helmzee: The Lucian paired with a Milio just doesn't seem good. Also C9 comp is very heavily outranged and outscaled
[1:41:42] HexBlast: lucian.... 󠀀

[1:41:55] Aoyos_: @DankWizard420 That was a long time ago now, super good though
[1:42:01] KianSucks: why Stormrazor rush and not ER on Lucian
[1:42:09] OceanLegacy: fly can mark the flankers with kasante and naut and they win a front to back team fight pretty easily.

[1:42:42] AzureCatalyst: @frieza558 Keyboard is nice
[1:42:46] Aoyos_: They're twitch chat comments they used the screen cropping button with no extra processing after the layoffs, good stuff
[1:42:46] wadswootie: Flyquest should signed doublelift
[1:42:55] AzureCatalyst: @frieza558 I feel like I use keyboards for nongaming shit and it's nice having a responsive typing setup
[1:43:02] LilGimli: unless you're aiming, then lucian is trash
[1:43:05] killerpineapple1: jojo is not known for control mages too right? i feel like hes more of an assassin/outplay sorta carry not saying that neeko cant do but just takes a lot of knowledge
[1:43:09] najafan: @LilGimli It's also at least partially teams playing around it.
[1:43:13] AzureCatalyst: TL shoulda kicked Yeon and signed Double
[1:43:18] AzureCatalyst: Because Yeon is not him
[1:43:20] leamfor: Massu is better anyway, or will be better
[1:43:25] Tpro83: Wouldn't work. Fly wants to win games.
[1:43:26] trueaether: aatrox feels like such a bait pick in 2024

[1:43:39] PoBeaver: Renegades should have signed doublelift LUL
[1:43:41] AzureCatalyst: If I have to watch another season of APA and Yeon trying to play carries I'm going to die
[1:43:49] Helmzee: @AzureCatalyst Better adc's in academy or even on ladder that are better than Yeon and aren't going to cost DL salary
[1:43:49] Kiwislap: i feel getting dl would ruin the bwipo inspire synergy

[1:44:18] trinzik2: how did inspired get passive on raptors at lvl 2
[1:44:20] unknown87644: lcs is on same level if not better than LEC right guys
[1:44:24] trinzik2: thought you needed 3 spells

[1:45:05] AzureCatalyst: @frieza558 I know there are some TKL Ducky One's that are reasonably priced. If you're lookign for a large scale manufactured one the K65 Corsair is nice. The Glorious GMMK 2 is not terrible either, but it's really depending on your budget
[1:45:06] leamfor: PepeLaugh DOESHEKNOW
[1:45:07] Imaslapyou: Jesus Christ I haven't been following the meta, since when is Brand a jg
[1:45:16] Tpro83: With butter
[1:45:17] HexBlast: if brand waits until there 3s left on Q cooldown before casting W he can proc passive with only 2 spells

[1:45:30] DankWizard420: is there an actual overlap between lcs viewers and kia buyers? Susge
[1:45:34] trinzik2: I guess he was lvl 2 with E + W, and would W -> wait to E -> W to get passive
[1:45:36] trinzik2: on raptros

[1:46:24] AzureCatalyst: @frieza558 I usually go Tenkeyless but you can chjeck around to how big your desk space is and what you're looking for in terms of keyboards
[1:46:27] Beigeish: @MonteCristo    hat i would do to have that triple camera available for the whole game, does pro view still exist?
[1:46:29] DankWizard420: forgot nautilus was a champion
[1:46:31] wadswootie: Doublelift stomped jacket love  at MSI
[1:46:32] Tpro83: He dashed in
[1:46:32] l1ght0heav3n: I guess berserker doesn’t know how to stand behind minions
[1:46:34] catast999: berserker had e'd forward before hook lands btw
[1:46:37] belminkaric10: because hes from NA thats why, they suck
[1:46:40] sorcaaa: There is no replay system in lol?
[1:46:42] Faaaux: dashed in lol
[1:46:44] HexBlast: dashes forward and doesnt even get damage...
[1:46:44] leamfor: Bwipo reviewed it and said that the lvl diff didn't even matter.
[1:46:46] Ostrider_: Has Beserker been doing worse this season?
[1:46:46] AzureCatalyst: Oh shit
[1:46:46] DankWizard420: level3 nautilus trumps level2 lucian LUL
[1:46:47] trinzik2: that dash notlikethis
[1:46:51] AzureCatalyst: I'm getting flashbacks to hooks in this game
[1:46:52] Giiino: he doesnt respect the KIA MULTILANE CAM either
[1:46:53] Tpro83: Dash and shield used before hook
[1:46:56] Zebrios: Lack of respect, yep
[1:46:59] A_MericanPelican: kinda looks like he tried to dodge the hook and guessed wrong
[1:47:01] mrkatsudonnn: why didn’t he take cleanse??
[1:47:08] enreves: skill issue
[1:47:08] Aoyos_: @trinzik2 You can technically get Brand's passive to proc if you go for ability haste minor rune and have great timing. E then W right before the stack runs out gives you enough time to wait for E to get out of CD to apply the third stack
[1:47:09] killerpineapple1: not used to having too lol
[1:47:09] DavidSzajnuk: ego?

[1:47:42] Bloodbow99: They learned to save flash from Zven.
[1:47:44] AzureCatalyst: Cleanse is only useful for chain of corruption or nautilus passive
[1:47:48] Aoyos_: @trinzik2 At level 2 Brand I mean, any extra levels only make it easier
[1:47:48] AzureCatalyst: The only other cc is brand stun

[1:48:45] MrHandsomeNoodle: i mean that hook doesnt seem sketch, the animation just centers on the hitbox once it hits, which it obviously did on that one
[1:48:48] mjoll_the_hotness: is it spectator bug or does this happen in soloq alot. i havent played in MANY years

[1:49:29] fartnugget45: i think the hitbox on naut hook expands at the end of  the hook. like inflates

[1:54:20] nealus: Heal???
[1:54:20] DankWizard420: Jebaited berserker
[1:54:21] PapaSmithy: ya massu didnt auto
[1:54:24] warpenguin555: I should just give up on cheering for everybody after this last year. all my teams choke
[1:54:27] squires: Massu's playing at max range too
[1:54:32] PapaSmithy: to not give vision
[1:54:35] leamfor: Massu stopped autoing to drop vision 5Head
[1:54:36] AzureCatalyst: yeee
[1:54:41] AzureCatalyst: Massu not autoing is so good
[1:54:46] Zebrios: Busio is good, man
[1:54:48] DankWizard420: just based off that fly wins the split LUL
[1:54:49] Aoyos_: Massu was charging Q
[1:54:51] Aoyos_: It was accidental
[1:54:52] trespasur: @PapaSmithy ty for all u do
[1:54:52] PleasantNA: berserker getting auto spaced by a rookie
[1:54:54] weak_mental_renekton: always fight and die into a stacked wave
[1:54:57] l1ght0heav3n: Berserker getting outclassed by a rookie is just embarrassing
[1:55:02] JeeFour: @MonteCristo ward in bush
[1:55:05] DankWizard420: @Aoyos_ after the Q
[1:55:07] Slayra: the sweeper disabled the ward 5Head
[1:55:08] PapaSmithy: arrow has the belt to help with the learning, so they'll scale
[1:55:11] JeeFour: @MonteCristo wait no ignore me
[1:55:13] AzureCatalyst: Ward is swept so they deny vision
[1:55:18] enreves: monkaW
[1:55:20] AdmiralReggie: AND... he got the cannon EZ
[1:55:21] AzureCatalyst: This is a fantastic 2 vs 2 micro
[1:55:24] leamfor: @Aoyos_ Nah, you're just wrong.
[1:55:26] maletroll: been a diamond supp for ages and never done that lens play :O
[1:55:33] PapaSmithy: best moment incoming
[1:55:35] PapaSmithy: reaction cam
[1:55:38] JeeFour: monkaW
[1:55:41] LuxtheGod: wasnt there a minion in the bush
[1:55:42] Imaslapyou: Are they actually Zoomers or millenials
[1:55:47] AzureCatalyst: @Imaslapyou Zoomers
[1:55:49] Imaslapyou: what's the cutoff, '96?
[1:55:49] mickzerofive: hey @PapaSmithy nice to see u again
[1:55:51] mickzerofive: miss ya mate
[1:56:02] AzureCatalyst: Busio is a 2003 birthday
[1:56:08] Imaslapyou: Oof
[1:56:08] DankWizard420: brand can farm EZ
[1:56:10] leamfor: @Imaslapyou Most of these people are Zoomers by most social scientists definition of the generation.
[1:56:11] Slayra: @imaslapyou millennials are old already
[1:56:17] Tpro83: Cannon
[1:56:18] AzureCatalyst: Massu is a 2004 birthday
[1:56:21] AzureCatalyst: They're giga zoomers
[1:56:21] killerpineapple1: the ranged winons
[1:56:23] killerpineapple1: yes
[1:56:25] najafan: "The future is now old man" -Busio
[1:56:30] Aoyos_: @leamfor He was literally charging Q while walking into the bush and then he autos the moment Q goes off
[1:56:33] leamfor: @leamfor Jensen, Impact, CoreJJ, Huhi are like the only millennials.
[1:56:35] trespasur: if i m c9 im not touching lucian ever again
[1:56:40] DankWizard420: @Imaslapyou the oldest zoomers are 96+ (I'm technically one SadgeCry )
[1:56:40] enreves: fkn bwipo
[1:56:40] dah777: GIGACHAD cannon minion
[1:56:41] Harlekin_Muc: hhitbox is fixed
[1:56:45] Badseed31: Naut hit box look broken
[1:56:52] Imaslapyou: Sadge. '92 here
[1:57:05] AdmiralReggie: 8min ghostblade PogO
[1:57:09] Tpro83: Naut hook has a charm to it
[1:57:10] AzureCatalyst: @Aoyos_ There's another chance when he can auto but berserker is just outside the brush and has to get into the brush because the naut sweepered the brush which gives them enough time to kill berserker
[1:57:16] leamfor: @Aoyos_ He autos, throws E, autos again, and then stops. You're like 3 seconds too early before he stopped autoing to say it was accidental.
[1:57:16] PapaSmithy: now monte gets to see
[1:57:22] PapaSmithy: the weird and wonderful moments
[1:57:23] PapaSmithy: in this game
[1:57:30] AzureCatalyst: He doesn't auto thus allowing him to survive that fight with one auto's worth of hp @Aoyos_
[1:57:33] Clyde1500: @trespasur spoilers: they play it again
[1:57:34] trespasur: bro i was so happy for jojo neeko
[1:57:52] trespasur: kept the game alive so long
[1:57:52] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:57:53] Aoyos_: @AzureCatalyst You can literally see Berserker auto him during that because he was revealed during an auto after Q
[1:57:55] AzureCatalyst: @PapaSmithy Did you panic a bit when seeing the Jojo Neeko Flanks?
[1:58:00] ace_alchemist: PepegaAim
[1:58:04] mjoll_the_hotness: papa narrating like david attenbruh
[1:58:13] leamfor: Not yet.
[1:58:19] trespasur: @trespasur ik sadge
[1:58:21] Weazel21: Wonder how many more years Jensen has in him
[1:58:31] PapaSmithy: PepeLaugh
[1:58:40] JeeFour: i'm a bit behind on the meta, why is rell not ganking top/bot?
[1:58:42] killerpineapple1: @Weazel21 fakers still going strong so its def not about age
[1:58:44] dah777: PepeLaugh oh no no no

[1:58:49] Evan_Ralston: PepeLaugh
[1:58:49] enreves: peplaugh
[1:58:52] trespasur: NOT IF JOJO HAS ANYHTING TO SAY ABOUT IT
[1:58:52] leamfor: @Weazel21 Man seems to just like LoL. I can see 3-4 more years min.
[1:58:53] AzureCatalyst: @Aoyos_ There's a second chance for Berserker to auto but it's denied after. If you can't see it i'm not gonna argue with you. Berserker gets like 3 autos off, but there is an opportunity for 4/5 which are denied by the stopped autos. Many people are pointing out the same thing and even Papa said it so if you don't see it it's fine
[1:58:54] vriesea97: PepeLaugh
[1:58:55] PPowzer74: PepeLaugh
[1:58:56] enreves: PepeLaugh

[2:00:10] Tpro83: or Kobe...

[2:00:15] JeeFour: @Tpro83 it was kobe
[2:00:19] Voltiate: I felt that scream from Kobe
[2:00:27] Tpro83: the one guy said the thing
[2:00:32] killerpineapple1: @Weazel21 if your good your good most players get there fill and drop off but there's a few i think that will make the age gap irrelevant

[2:02:31] killerpineapple1: that bar of hp is 600

[2:05:47] ufukrks: “This is K'Sante, a champion with 4,700 HP, 329 Armor, and 201 MR, has Unstoppable, a Shield, and goes over walls. Has Airborne, and the cooldown is only 1 second too. It costs 15 Mana. The W CD is even refreshed when he transforms. He has true damage on his passive. Then, when he stacks Armor and MR, he gets Ability Haste too, Ability Haste to his Q, and his spell casting speeds up. Then, he has an AD ratio, so his W…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”

[2:06:33] Voltiate: didn't realize Berserker was the most NA of all Lucian players
[2:06:35] AzureCatalyst: Yooo
[2:06:40] AzureCatalyst: Massu bought a red pot this early
[2:06:44] AzureCatalyst: That's a surprise
[2:06:45] Slayra: Berserker spent too long in NA Aware
[2:06:51] l1ght0heav3n: @madiiiman why is he still here then
[2:06:57] mikejanderson: its that new rune potion
[2:07:00] AzureCatalyst: I've never seen a red pot this early on an adc, anyone know why he bought it?
[2:07:04] madiiiman: @l1ght0heav3n because hes under contract
[2:07:12] Anzlan: @Slayra so did Prince now his the worst in lpl
[2:07:23] AzureCatalyst: @mikejanderson Ooh you;'re right
[2:07:26] leamfor: @magic_mac Bruh, nadeshot was an actual successful pro. He'll gap Regi in every single thing in life, including being a decent human.
[2:07:26] LightfellowFGC: @AzureCatalyst That's not a red pot, that's a Cyclosomething item
[2:07:29] AzureCatalyst: PepegaAim

[2:09:31] AzureCatalyst: Surely not Thinkge
[2:09:35] leamfor: Jensen is just greedy, he thought he could tank it and shockwave them to pull them back

[2:09:43] mikejanderson: im fine guys i have seraphs
[2:09:44] Clyde1500: probably a good idea but we'll never know the answer Sadge
[2:09:46] dargor00: if he flashed earlier wouldnt jojo still follow him?
[2:09:52] canyon_55: FirstTimeChatter
[2:09:55] hellohihi145: berserker has finally adapted to na
[2:09:56] trespasur: FirstTimeChatter
[2:09:57] DankWizard420: @dargor00 probably but he wouldnt die LUL
[2:09:58] hellohihi145: and become shit
[2:09:58] eatluxury: @dargor00 if he times his flash like a human no
[2:10:02] Giiino: you need the charlie brown ugh emote
[2:10:04] najafan: @DankWizard420 It's a variation of General Tso's chicken with minor orange flavoring.
[2:10:21] DankWizard420: @najafan general tso? Susge lemme look it up
[2:10:23] PabloSnackobar: if he flashes neeko ult he is just straight up save and alive
[2:10:27] n_e_i_l: even if jojo react follows with flash its way better situation
[2:10:30] Zelgius: I respect the attempt, he almost got away with it
[2:10:34] mikejanderson: yeah takes too long for blaber to reach even if jojo flashes after
[2:10:35] JeeFour: FirstTimeChatter 󠀀
[2:10:36] mjoll_the_hotness: doubt jensen would ever play this differently he always plays like this no?
[2:10:36] wadswootie: I just googled nadeshot and see that he even says he was the lowest of the low and most toxic player. I guess it's obvious
[2:10:40] mikejanderson: i think anyway
[2:10:51] Rivalrry: He 100% should have flashed
[2:10:54] madiiiman: Its so depressing to remember guma was legit concerned Berserker would end up taking his roster spot he was so good as a prospect. And now hes just rotting in NA
[2:10:55] leamfor: @our_pale_blue_dot No, it's good.
[2:11:08] dargor00: ok i was kind of curious because i thought he should but blaber's hesitation on jojo's ult hitting brought up the question
[2:11:09] jayhow24: hubris
[2:11:14] Rivalrry: Rell w and r, neeko e and r and milio q. 100% a flash situation
[2:11:14] leamfor: @our_pale_blue_dot It pulled Neeko back, though, no?
[2:11:19] LightfellowFGC: Both Jensen and Bjergsen always held their flashes for some reason
[2:11:28] AzureCatalyst: @madiiiman Reminder that the only reason Berserker is on C9 is because Joe Marsh, Architect of Korean Esports, did LS a solid
[2:11:32] mjoll_the_hotness: its a confident player thing
[2:11:43] leamfor: @LightfellowFGC Hell no, Bjergsen did not hold flash. That's what separates Jensen and Bjergsen.
[2:11:44] mjoll_the_hotness: or they think peepoShrug
[2:11:53] ufukrks: @LightfellowFGC Jensen-Bjergsen rivalry... good old days
[2:11:59] trespasur: @AzureCatalyst they said if berserker left they would go after smash, the t1 trainee
[2:12:02] Rivalrry: @mjoll_the_hotness Doesn't mean it's good
[2:12:07] madiiiman: @AzureCatalyst yup. my theory to this day is that jack hired LS in part to get berserker, and then got rid of him after
[2:12:09] mjoll_the_hotness: def not
[2:12:14] VerbalHorse: Has he seen Berserker protesting this game?
[2:12:24] TheOnymous: Is jack in shambles?
[2:12:34] JeeFour: FirstTimeChatter
[2:12:41] leamfor: @Rivalrry It's what makes Jensen... Jensen.
[2:12:42] AzureCatalyst: @trespasur But Berserker wouldn't have been an option to join C8 if LS doesn't join C9 as a coach. Yeah he can leave but berserker goign to C9 is a sweetheart deal from T1
[2:12:46] AdmiralReggie: jk just leashing for Blaber
[2:12:58] DankWizard420: @madiiiman isnt something similar to that a given? atleast the ls ..influencing the berserker part
[2:13:03] rilsolo: the eye opening up didn't help the situation
[2:13:16] trespasur: @AzureCatalyst yeah i get that, best 2 wins of my life Sadge
[2:13:16] Rivalrry: @leamfor That's not the Incarnate I remember

[2:13:47] madiiiman: joe also needed to get berserker out of t1s academy system because guma was didnt like him iirc. he was a real threat to guma's roster spot in guma's mind so the option was either swap berserker in or have him go elsewhere so guma wud b ehappy
[2:13:51] mjoll_the_hotness: papa get the belt this is no good Smadging
[2:14:01] leamfor: @Rivalrry Bruh, Jensen has always greeded his flash and trusted his movement. It's where the Bodied by Jensen meme originally came from.
[2:14:04] trespasur: @madiiiman SEND HIM TO NA lol
[2:14:34] madiiiman: @trespasur ls joining c9 around the same time and gifting them berserker just line up well timing wise
[2:14:55] Warzard908: I hope if Berserker goes back to KR that he goes to a nice team
[2:15:05] madiiiman: @our_pale_blue_dot hes not. but berserker in t1 academy was like beyond insane. he was legit on track to potentially replace guma
[2:15:10] najafan: @madiiiman Didn't C9 pick up more than just Berseker from T1 as well? Winsome iirc?
[2:15:25] Warzard908: @our_pale_blue_dot he isn't but V cautious about berserker
[2:15:26] trespasur: I dont think berserker would ever leave C9 cuz he wouldnt have a worlds spot anywhere else besides eu tbh
[2:15:29] madiiiman: @najafan i mean, the only thing that actually mattered was verserker
[2:15:37] lotus_euphoria: @madiiiman i dont think t1 would win worlds with berserker
[2:15:49] DankWizard420: @trespasur no way in hell he ever gets on a team in eu LUL
[2:15:51] leamfor: Man, imagine C9 with Impact...
[2:15:57] Helmzee: @madiiiman Winsome was included to make the translation smoother for Berserker
[2:16:07] madiiiman: @lotus_euphoria i have no idea tbh. hes a very different player than guma. he is prone to ego checks that result in deaths guma would never have
[2:16:25] Warzard908: @najafan winsome was good in kr solo q and also didn't take up  a import slot like zven did
[2:16:35] Badseed31: @leamfor impact gets slept on a lot. but he gets to worlds a lot
[2:16:37] Helmzee: @our_pale_blue_dot Sounds like maybe Vulcan is the problem
[2:16:39] lotus_euphoria: @madiiiman if his ego is that big then i could see why he wasnt liked, but im not gonna believe rumors (no offense)
[2:16:44] AzureCatalyst: PepegaAim
[2:16:51] VerbalHorse: Kobe with the HUHH
[2:16:55] leamfor: HUH
[2:17:03] AzureCatalyst: WHATAREWESAYING
[2:17:03] trespasur: makes lucain sound real strong
[2:17:07] Komarimasita: LOL
[2:17:08] AzureCatalyst: WHATAREWESAYING KOBE
[2:17:08] Bloodbow99: Beserker is now a top laner?
[2:17:08] Goatsguffle: yeah bessrker is not as good as guma haha
[2:17:09] SomeFerretGuy: monkschrist
[2:17:12] leamfor: NAH HUH
[2:17:13] najafan: @lotus_euphoria A lot of this is public info, imputing the motivations is not.
[2:17:13] madiiiman: @lotus_euphoria when i say ego check i mean hed make plays under the assumption he could outplay,so hed take disadvantagous choices sometimes. npt that he has an actual massive ego
[2:17:15] trespasur: oh?
[2:17:15] MrWooody: monkaS
[2:17:17] hellohihi145: Wokege
[2:17:18] professor_wormbog_: They're forming a strong warrior bond, okay?
[2:17:22] Slayra: Aware

[2:17:22] Voltiate: yikes
[2:17:31] paddlestar_gallactica: cue the michael Jackson cross promo
[2:17:32] killerpineapple1: I could totally see Kobe in that Spiritual massage room XD
[2:17:32] Helmzee: @our_pale_blue_dot Vulcan is very bad on enchanters, itemization of him is quite odd at times. He's a very one dimensional support player which in the support role...... not great
[2:17:36] SPQR_Brutus: LMAO
[2:17:39] HexBlast: this game felt lost when berserker and vulcan died twice in lane
[2:17:46] ace_alchemist: Aware
[2:17:48] MissingMatter: They're grabbing some gyros at the food truck.
[2:17:55] SPQR_Brutus: erastes and eromenos GoldenAge
[2:17:55] trespasur: didnt they like ban geachother to help with synergy?
[2:17:58] madiiiman: @najafan ego check is just a term for  taking a knowingly losing trade/fight because you believe you can outplay the opponent
[2:18:02] AzureCatalyst: Busio just solo walking into a group of 4 without the carries anywhere nearby
[2:18:08] AzureCatalyst: Watch what jojo does with his neeko clone
[2:18:08] VerbalHorse: Cracked ult by Jojo tho
[2:18:11] leamfor: Pulled a Chovy here
[2:18:15] catast999: he did the chovy
[2:18:16] unknown87644: that was good fake
[2:18:20] najafan: @madiiiman Oh, I didn't mean that. I meant Marsh's motivations and such, lol.

[2:18:35] trespasur: jojo such a good pick up
[2:18:37] SPQR_Brutus: Trivia: Who was the bottom in the following: patroclus or achilles?
[2:18:37] mjoll_the_hotness: ksante gaming time
[2:18:38] AzureCatalyst: Like that's a really good micro from Jojo
[2:18:40] VerbalHorse: Fudge TP is criminal tho no?
[2:18:45] belminkaric10: how tanky isnt that fking jungler of c9?
[2:18:52] leamfor: Massu was the best prospect in Academy despite playing with 150 ping from Canada @MonteCristo His mechanics on LAN are cracked.
[2:19:12] PapaSmithy: wifi wizard
[2:19:23] squires: That's the first time I think I've actually seen the clone trick people in pro play
[2:19:27] trespasur: mannnn c9 thanatos was an option Sadge
[2:19:30] VerbalHorse: Blaber's full health still
[2:19:32] mjoll_the_hotness: lag tp
[2:19:33] leamfor: @squires Chovy did it.
[2:19:35] maletroll: i think milio rell is enough peel for lucian
[2:19:49] SomeFerretGuy: @squires actually watched a game where chovy did the same last night on bangers
[2:19:52] Komarimasita: they used to call me the touchpad tank cause i played mmo's and league on touchpad until i bought my own PC
[2:19:58] madiiiman: wait i just learned summit is playing in Mexico wtf?
[2:20:00] AzureCatalyst: The Chovy Clone trick

[2:20:06] trespasur: @madiiiman WHERE HE BELONGS
[2:20:07] killerpineapple1: chovy did it first lol
[2:20:08] squires: Yes, I clearly missed it, haha
[2:20:13] Komarimasita: not quite as successful as massu sadly
[2:20:15] madiiiman: summit and lava are in mexico wow

[2:21:07] SomeFerretGuy: stop crying your eyes are fine
[2:21:26] Tpro83: Real Chovy is fake JoJo
[2:21:30] AzureCatalyst: HE DOES THE JOKE EMOTE TOO
[2:21:33] AzureCatalyst: SO THE CLONE LASTS LONGER
[2:21:43] mjoll_the_hotness: and the oscar goes to
[2:21:45] Cremlindor: That's ingenious

[2:22:22] Voltiate: destroyed
[2:22:25] trespasur: CHOVY DID THE JOJO
[2:22:27] madiiiman: LUL
[2:22:33] maletroll: like dota gameplay
[2:22:40] Giiino: thats so sick
[2:22:43] rilsolo: he didn't emote i think thats why massu almsot made it out to
[2:22:43] killerpineapple1: he does not use the rocket belt
[2:22:48] paddlestar_gallactica: anachronistic jojo
[2:22:50] Komarimasita: its just a good move
[2:22:53] SonsOfJarvan: Chovy did it vs ns
[2:22:53] Knait0: Poby is the real neeko master
[2:22:53] dah777: jojo did the chovy*

[2:23:28] Edwxrd3: what makes chovy so good. Like why cant na mids just copy that mf and be as good tbh
[2:23:28] eatluxury: yeah but is chovy better at fortnite? don't think so
[2:23:34] AzureCatalyst: Poby has been lowkey pretty good in challengers with neeko
[2:23:38] frieza558: Chovy could never do that move in lcs tho
[2:23:39] windows2040: so what's the verdict
[2:23:40] Cremlindor: The church if Chovy showed him a glimpse of the future
[2:23:43] windows2040: why is c9 so trash now
[2:23:45] Zelgius: @eatluxury wouldn't put money on that
[2:23:45] AzureCatalyst: I watched caedrel's reaction to that and it's actually pretty good
[2:23:45] trueaether: Shows up as just a red dot on the minimap so the enemy jg just gets pincered unknowingly
[2:23:48] SomeFerretGuy: the verdict is hold your damn horses
[2:23:49] LilGimli: man fudge has just been an anchor this season too
[2:23:52] thugitakhrushchev: PogChamp holy shit diagnosing C9
[2:23:53] leamfor: @our_pale_blue_dot Prob best mid so far
[2:23:56] AzureCatalyst: @windows2040 What if I told you C9 was always trash Thinkge
[2:24:01] LightfellowFGC: @MonteCristo would peak Marin be top-tier player today?
[2:24:07] killerpineapple1: @frieza558 we just saw jojo do it so why could others not?
[2:24:13] AzureCatalyst: The rest of NA was just too trash to punish their sit back and scale strat
[2:24:20] AzureCatalyst: NBope
[2:24:27] najafan: @LightfellowFGC Any player from 5+ years ago wouldn't be good today
[2:24:33] DavP3rz: In LEC someone avoids chain of corruption transforming into a minion
[2:24:34] Slayra: the rat noticed xdd
[2:24:35] rilsolo: his clone went away before he even started it LuL
[2:24:38] trespasur: @AzureCatalyst how do u think tl won 4 in a row?
[2:24:39] killerpineapple1: i like how he says proto belt
[2:24:42] najafan: We know so much more about the game.
[2:24:44] LightfellowFGC: @najafan >Faker
[2:24:46] Cremlindor: He is so good at it, even the casters failed to notice
[2:24:47] killerpineapple1: but im pretty sure he never used
[2:24:47] mjoll_the_hotness: i always remember sneaky playing with incarnation 1st time on stream. hes been in na for so long
[2:24:53] VerbalHorse: And they lose top turret
[2:24:53] AzureCatalyst: @najafan I disagree. Uzi with his 2018 wrists and no back pain is actually the GOAT
[2:24:56] najafan: Faker from 5 years ago is worse than Faker now.
[2:24:56] mjoll_the_hotness: and skipped eulcs not like bjergsen
[2:24:59] leamfor: @our_pale_blue_dot Before this week, I would agree. This week, Palafox was pretty weak, while Jensen remained steady.
[2:25:03] SomeFerretGuy: @najafan huh

[2:29:56] GingerBeardJo: Sludge me right now
[2:29:59] thugitakhrushchev: lol we 7tv emotes now
[2:30:00] rfarleydude97: also Fudge underwhelming as shit? who woulda thought
[2:30:02] enreves: Sludge
[2:30:04] thedeadoctopus: fudge literally did nothing that play
[2:30:06] rfarleydude97: as if no one expected it
[2:30:07] AzureCatalyst: @GodlyAlba Most of us don't use the xddBusiness emotes though
[2:30:08] dah777: Sludge nice, my kind of emote
[2:30:13] ace_alchemist: c9 Sludge
[2:30:18] canyon_55: add Fraud emote
[2:30:32] lotus_euphoria: i still do not understand why LCS does BO1's
[2:30:36] AzureCatalyst: FRAUD
[2:30:42] canyon_55: C9 FRAUD
[2:30:46] GodlyAlba: AzureCatalyst i await the day monte types one xdd in chat Pepehands
[2:30:49] thugitakhrushchev: how does Monte feell about adding 7tv emotes?
[2:30:53] mjoll_the_hotness: mindcontrol his adc duh
[2:30:54] Helmzee: People just love to hate Fudge because he's an LS guy honestly
[2:30:58] Zelgius: @lotus_euphoria because viewers dont like Bo3
[2:31:02] AzureCatalyst: Well this is punishment for the rest of his career @MonteCristo  Sludge
[2:31:02] VerbalHorse: This game is mainly on Berserker/bot lane
[2:31:02] Helmzee: Fudge is put in a ton of losing positions by mid and bot
[2:31:03] rfarleydude97: oh this game wasnt his fault
[2:31:09] leamfor: Flank in teamfights and get one shot cause his build is dog. OMEGALUL
[2:31:09] tomipacy: when will the jdg lng review begin?
[2:31:10] rfarleydude97: except for one or two plays
[2:31:11] killerpineapple1: lucian playing tank this game
[2:31:13] lotus_euphoria: @Zelgius lck and lpl do huge numbers..?
[2:31:14] najafan: @Helmzee I hate Fudge because he built Hollow Radiance last game
[2:31:15] canyon_55: FirstTimeChatter
[2:31:15] rfarleydude97: like you just mentioned LOL
[2:31:18] fjord3: has berserker become too americanized too carry c9?
[2:31:19] zPostModern: NA lucian is too cursed. it was lost from draft
[2:31:19] AzureCatalyst: If Sludge was a less subpar top laner we wouldn't have to punish him Sludge
[2:31:20] killerpineapple1: crit stick?
[2:31:20] Elbluntdealer: thoughts on blaber's performance this game?
[2:31:22] enreves: tbh its classic fudge. He just always exists in the game
[2:31:23] leamfor: Bwipo heavily criticized his build @MonteCristo
[2:31:30] Zelgius: @lotus_euphoria and lcs doesn't
[2:31:31] Voltiate: hard to win with a lucian comp when the lucian isn't in the server
[2:31:32] trespasur: chat is this real?
[2:31:34] killerpineapple1: is that even the build? qickblades are better no?
[2:31:34] trespasur: cuh
[2:31:36] Helmzee: @najafan Fair his itemization on Udyr has been god awful. I truly think he hates playing the champ so he performs shitty on it
[2:31:37] thedeadoctopus: @lotus_euphoria because if they switch to BO3 then riot will be admitting that Bo1s were bad for the last how many years
[2:31:45] mjoll_the_hotness: like this lucian baiting fly to fight would have worked for rng back in the days because of uzis fancy feet and spacing
[2:31:46] Bloodtotem: Is C9 doomed or savable?
[2:31:53] leamfor: The profane is grief. He should have just gone bruiser
[2:31:58] lotus_euphoria: @Zelgius not as much as lck
[2:32:00] Helmzee: I truly think the biggest issue with C9 right now is their itemization in game
[2:32:03] sethredreiter: shouldn't it be sunderer into shojin if you want bruiser
[2:32:08] Helmzee: Effectively wasting so much gold
[2:32:08] Badseed31: I like how fly gives bwipo 4th or 5th pick all the time. They value top lane for sure.
[2:32:09] AzureCatalyst: Also B03's isn't worth the investment in additional broadcast days when LCS already is a dying league. No point in paying producers and camerapeople for more days
[2:32:13] lotus_euphoria: @sethredreiter sunderer isnt in game anymore
[2:32:17] l1ght0heav3n: Maybe C9 should let blaber and jojo carry like they did the first 3 games. but I guess that’s too easy
[2:32:22] sethredreiter: @l1ght0heav3n sundered sky
[2:32:26] leamfor: You'll see it later, Fudge can't ever contest Bwipo. @MonteCristo
[2:32:32] killerpineapple1: infinity edge is griefing too
[2:32:33] canyon_55: C9 FRAUD
[2:32:34] PapaSmithy: nothing else to see this game clolse your eyes
[2:32:37] najafan: Their drafts are fiiiiine, but they don't build appropriately *given* those drafts imo

[2:38:58] killerpineapple1: @oddlookn i mean they made wildrift
[2:39:00] AzureCatalyst: I love when chat said "You'll see it later" and we watch the slow realization that NA is a shitshow form upon Monte's psyche

[2:39:27] QuackTheDuck: @oddlookn didnt dota rewrite their codebase using source 2? if a less sucessful game can do it, riot cant?
[2:39:29] ADrugge: Rip Dgon. Another 6 year black ball from broadcast for mentioning Monte.

[2:43:53] weenteen1: @quacktheduck what about it? I was asking you a question. not sure what Smite has to do with anything
[2:43:54] ThatLatvianGuy: lucian is 40-19 in lpl/lck combined
[2:43:54] trespasur: emenes and gori gonge
[2:43:55] InvertedOrange_: i like the idea but not for a post game interview maybe a skit

[2:44:01] trespasur: okayy
[2:44:04] Ondrox: Mkay!
[2:44:06] JeeFour: FirstTimeChatter
[2:44:13] oddlookn: @weenteen1 so in league players get huge salary’s, obviously we’re starting to see that cut back but in general people make their money from being paid monthly by teams. In dota players still get paid but they get paid significantly less, players become rich in dota by winning a tournament rather then getting paid from the teams
[2:44:13] trespasur: FirstTimeChatter
[2:44:21] najafan: cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB cristoPLEB
[2:44:43] QuackTheDuck: @weenteen1 smite is less prize pool than dota and league and is still rewriting their code in unreal 5

[2:45:27] killerpineapple1: she just appeard after layoffs
[2:45:27] squires: The Mean Girls references, that'll get the zoomers!
[2:45:28] amped_15: Appreciate any league broadcast trying new things, but that was dumb AF
[2:45:28] DankWizard420: the kids Aware
[2:45:34] btoastmanl: @Slayra well to be fair, im 40 years old, i played dota when it was a mod in warcraft, i love the moba genre.

[2:45:38] NitroDavid: @MonteCristo LCK has RoxTigers, LCS has RoxBottom
[2:45:40] enreves: I dont watch either
[2:45:46] QuackTheDuck: @weenteen1 smite despite NOT being even a fraction as profitable and popular as league and dota yet they can rewrite old code in unreal 5
[2:45:48] najafan: Mean girls is a millennial thing, a millennial thing!
[2:45:52] SomeFerretGuy: this game is ... a game
[2:45:53] Giiino: dont tell me you arent excited for the spongebob sweet victory before the super bowl
[2:45:55] MissingMatter: I don't have any idea what's happening on the NFL OR Nickelodeon.
[2:45:55] Komarimasita: ...not even teennick?

[2:46:04] SugarSlapper: The burn book yeah
[2:46:05] najafan: The burn book.
[2:46:06] enreves: Its so fetch

[2:46:11] AzureCatalyst: Where they wrote mean shit about the other classmates
[2:46:13] frieza558: Mean Girls up next on Four Play
[2:46:18] serawrbear: that was their burn book
[2:46:20] InvertedOrange_: the musical just came out in theaters
[2:46:22] Sjkaev: mean girls was fun
[2:46:23] Tpro83: They remade Mean Girls I think last month.
[2:46:24] trespasur: freaky friday

[2:46:24] IrishProphet: high key a very good movie imo
[2:46:24] ctrain46: i never saw it
[2:46:25] InvertedOrange_: so they are using that
[2:46:28] Helmzee: C9 banning Karma after trying it once on 14.2 is very telling. They can't flex it because Vulcan can't play it properly
[2:46:28] commando1814: what was the movie before mean girls
[2:46:29] svienvt: Mean girls is fkn S-tier
[2:46:29] QuackTheDuck: Why are we using Mean Girls reference?
[2:46:30] amped_15: They just released a new mean girls so I think they thought it was relevant
[2:46:31] AzureCatalyst: lol
[2:46:32] paddlestar_gallactica: low key? more like high key
[2:46:32] najafan: It was a fine movie. But there's no need to remake it.
[2:46:33] Sjkaev: thorin and rich KEKW
[2:46:33] SomeFerretGuy: hahahah

[2:46:53] Fissiccisst: Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie wtf
[2:46:54] SomeFerretGuy: I want to hear rich and thorin react to comedy
[2:46:56] Sjkaev: whatabout american pie
[2:46:57] CoveredPillow: @MonteCristo you guys should do a fourplay series on spoof movies
[2:46:58] QuackTheDuck: I think Thorin would unironically would love it
[2:46:59] commando1814: " she's taking a piss "
[2:47:00] killerpineapple1: lol they would be slinging slang at you the whole time for making them watch it lol
[2:47:00] dbxnaato: gotta watch legally blonde
[2:47:01] trespasur: mrs doubtfire is sooooooo goated
[2:47:04] AzureCatalyst: Legally Blonde or White Chicks with THorin and RLewis is my fucking fantasy 4Play
[2:47:05] mjoll_the_hotness: you need to do a bet with them to watch it
[2:47:10] paddlestar_gallactica: sorry my brand doesn’t allow me to watch good movies
[2:47:10] Elbluntdealer: i feel like your more open to watching a broader range of things
[2:47:12] ThatLatvianGuy: do a RaccAttack week, full degen movies
[2:47:13] Komarimasita: i could see thorin having the hottest takes for mrs. doubtfire
[2:47:19] AzureCatalyst: I'D FUCKING DIE
[2:47:21] ctrain46: AND I NEED YOU
[2:47:21] MissingMatter: Weekend Raz on this week's cast. I forget which game though.
[2:47:22] commando1814: rush hour
[2:47:22] kerokerogrips: mean girls is like totally spies the subject revolves around women but it doesnt make it exclusive for them its just a funny movie all around
[2:47:24] mjoll_the_hotness: white chicks is a classic
[2:47:25] LastArchangeI: too woke for them lol
[2:47:26] SomeFerretGuy: princess bride, legally blonde, white chicks and mean girls?
[2:47:27] Sjkaev: bro white chicks would be sick LUL
[2:47:28] trespasur: DO ITTTTT
[2:47:31] Mekelek42: YES
[2:47:33] killerpineapple1: aight the Dicks would love white chicks
[2:47:35] leamfor: Tropic Thunder GOATED
[2:47:35] DankWizard420: surely Aware
[2:47:35] Sjkaev: and tropic thunder LUL
[2:47:37] AzureCatalyst: Thorin and Richard Leiws reacting to White Chicks and Tropic Thunder is actually lowkey a  banger
[2:47:38] Knait0: Why is a guy from NASA in the back?
[2:47:39] killerpineapple1: they would have a gag at it lol
[2:47:41] ThatLatvianGuy: tropic thunder is a great movie though
[2:47:42] VerbalHorse: True, white face into black face double header
[2:47:43] mikalhaze: throw in a big mammas house to spice it up
[2:47:44] AzureCatalyst: I NEED IT IN MY LIFE MONTE
[2:47:49] Slayra: didn't Hai have a team or whatever? what is he doing as a assistant to the assistant coach? Stare
[2:47:55] Tpro83: Tropic Thunder might be the last great comedy.
[2:47:56] mjoll_the_hotness: tropic thunder is my favorite comedy movie of all time
[2:47:58] frieza558: throw Team America in there
[2:47:59] Sjkaev: it is very good
[2:48:01] killerpineapple1: i gotta watch that movie now lol
[2:48:02] killerpineapple1: its been forever
[2:48:02] commando1814: only if Richard does the terry crews dance
[2:48:06] DankWizard420: no way tropic thunder gets released today
[2:48:06] LastArchangeI: what do you mean you people?
[2:48:06] Darkraging: It's much better to watch now than when it released
[2:48:12] wrann_d: Who's a key grip?
[2:48:15] JakeJr: People tried to cancel it
[2:48:16] trespasur: I don't know what kind of pan-Pacific bullshit power play you're trying to pull here, but Asia, Jack, is my territory.
[2:48:20] Ikkarrow: I do not think that movie could be made today
[2:48:21] commando1814: what do you mean YOU PEOPLE
[2:48:21] leamfor: I'm black, and it did get flak for black face, but it's just too funny.
[2:48:21] Fissiccisst: I didn't realize the boss was tom cruise at first in that movie
[2:48:22] LastArchangeI: blazing saddle lol
[2:48:25] suprimo114: i love the tobey maguire fake trailer
[2:48:26] Giiino: tom cruise in that movie is amazing
[2:48:27] AzureCatalyst: classic
[2:48:30] svienvt: @commando1814 LuL
[2:48:32] mikalhaze: yea tom cruise killed it
[2:48:34] JeeFour: @MonteCristo i cant believe tom cruise got in it, in a fat suit no less
[2:48:34] pledz_: i had it on dvd and thought it was terrible for like 10 years then watched it on tv and it was so fuckin good
[2:48:36] fruge2: watch the rdj joe rogan clip talking about him doing the role
[2:48:37] JohrDinh: "Jelly Beans"
[2:48:39] mjoll_the_hotness: robery downey jr is a homie and he can do whatever he wants
[2:48:41] madiiiman: im just a dude dressed as a dude playing another dude
[2:48:41] fruge2: brilliant shit
[2:48:45] thugitakhrushchev: PepeLaugh oh no no

[2:49:02] hellohihi145: c9 was dog
[2:49:02] commando1814: @svienvt the Tom crews part would've violated tos
[2:49:05] VerbalHorse: Why are they running back the LUcian? Is it Berseker calling fo rthis or what?
[2:49:05] killerpineapple1: 0-3
[2:49:07] NitroDavid: when is the C9 vs TSM match?
[2:49:07] killerpineapple1: no change
[2:49:16] Slayra: "APA is just a one trick Ziggs" surely that means you just ban it, right? Clueless
[2:49:18] Ikkarrow: I think tropic thunder did not get canceled bc it came out right as PC Culture was starting
[2:49:21] TheOnymous: Tropic Thunder is my favorite Tom Cruise performance
[2:49:21] mjoll_the_hotness: ok this is a easy win for c9 right
[2:49:22] SomeFerretGuy: PepeLaugh its coming
[2:49:27] Elbluntdealer: imagine having zven as support in this meta
[2:49:35] MissingMatter: @NitroDavid I think it was a forfeit on account of TSM not having a team.
[2:49:45] mjoll_the_hotness: c9 stomp back on the track to win lcs riiiiight
[2:49:46] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo please watch the APA interview after this game
[2:49:50] SomeFerretGuy: cristoLCS
[2:49:54] trespasur: is fudge lck calibre thoooo??????

[2:50:01] SomeFerretGuy: yay!
[2:50:01] najafan: Gnar plz
[2:50:17] trespasur: Summit seetheing
[2:50:23] Nytrodark: the apa special
[2:50:33] Sjkaev: was dgon on this week?
[2:50:35] Elbluntdealer: shoulda picked rell
[2:50:37] SomeFerretGuy: if you win who cares about allegations
[2:50:39] Helmzee: C9 draft here is really awful
[2:50:44] mjoll_the_hotness: yeah need some pretty good luck with mega gnar
[2:50:45] hellohihi145: THIS GAME IS SO ATROCIOUS FROM C9
[2:50:48] Tpro83: I mean, it doesn't have to go on someone. It can sleep into ult
[2:50:48] killerpineapple1: neeko would hav been better
[2:50:49] leamfor: Wouldn't matter for Jensen @MonteCristo
[2:50:49] Juicypika: no
[2:50:50] Clyde1500: meteos and spica were talking about they have no idea what lilia is supposed to do.
[2:50:50] hellohihi145: AT ALL LEVELS
[2:50:51] l1ght0heav3n: C9 loves no engage comps
[2:50:51] killerpineapple1: he played it good last game
[2:50:54] killerpineapple1: lost to iro
[2:50:54] VerbalHorse: Mithy already tweeted that the drafts were shit, his fault 100% he said
[2:50:55] Elbluntdealer: no they drafted bacd
[2:50:55] Bloodtotem: no, this shit was GARBAGE
[2:50:56] Helmzee: I don't understand their Lucian prio and the desire to pair it with Milio
[2:50:57] trespasur: mithy is just blind
[2:50:58] osrskuzzy: c9 tilted
[2:50:58] killerpineapple1: must pick ori
[2:50:59] AzureCatalyst: NAHHHHHHHHH
[2:50:59] Warzard908: Nope this draft trash
[2:50:59] svienvt: The thought was there, too bad it just wasn't a full thought
[2:51:01] ADrugge: Missing c9 brain
[2:51:02] thugitakhrushchev: no you are not, C9 actually cant draft
[2:51:03] mikalhaze: hate to see it
[2:51:04] AzureCatalyst: NAHHH LILIA IS THE PLAY
[2:51:04] SomeFerretGuy: nope \
[2:51:10] AzureCatalyst: nope
[2:51:11] SomeFerretGuy: nope this draft really is this bad
[2:51:13] BeitNowKnown: Ori+ Lilia is a lot of movespeed, might not need to have a dash to get good placement?
[2:51:14] leamfor: Jensen wouldn't have a problem GIGACHAD
[2:51:15] Nytrodark: nope
[2:51:17] mjoll_the_hotness: maybe the whole crew is on tilt
[2:51:25] trespasur: maokai / rubmle anyone??? Prayge
[2:51:26] madiiiman: no, but c9 comp is
[2:51:27] l1ght0heav3n: @verbalhorse problem is he’s a crap coach and nothing will change
[2:51:30] najafan: Maokai does it all. He engages, he disengages, he tanks, he does AP, he slices, he dices.
[2:51:30] dah777: we are all missing the punchline too LUL
[2:51:31] VerbalHorse: Noct would go hard here no?
[2:51:35] Knait0: This was for sure a rell jungle game
[2:51:38] amped_15: Blaber gonna farm so fast on Lillia though so it's fine guys
[2:51:39] SomeFerretGuy: @VerbalHorse first ban
[2:51:46] killerpineapple1: they have no CC
[2:51:47] VerbalHorse: @SomeFerretGuy LUL im blind
[2:51:48] AzureCatalyst: Ori ball the lucian LUL
[2:51:48] thugitakhrushchev: BUT Monte, Blaber told the coaches that he wants to carry
[2:51:49] leamfor: @Knait0 Please, no, no more Blaber Rell
[2:51:51] Helmzee: Also how do they reliably engage with just Gnar into Lulu Aphelios and Ziggs?
[2:51:56] killerpineapple1: well they do but its really conditional
[2:51:58] Elbluntdealer: just take rell again
[2:52:03] killerpineapple1: yeah not palying blabers best champ
[2:52:05] Knait0: @leamfor watch this lilia and you will ask for rell LUL
[2:52:07] najafan: But wait there's more!
[2:52:07] killerpineapple1: mao was crazy
[2:52:14] najafan: We could also pick Brand!
[2:52:27] Clyde1500: they keep picking lucian so I doubt people being bad at champs is a concern.
[2:52:29] trespasur: these are terrible win cons
[2:52:29] squires: Lillia's good against Udyr, but the comp as a whole just seems like they wanted to ego on TL and win early.
[2:52:30] Udslusher: Does ori ball stay on through mao w(i don't know)
[2:52:30] Knait0: But I think the main problem is lucian going even or losing lane this game
[2:52:30] oddlookn: @montecristo maokai is also ap so if they’re coping about needing ap maokai just does that too
[2:52:37] AzureCatalyst: Surely
[2:52:37] leamfor: @Knait0 No, never. I've watched all his games, it's never a Blaber Rell angle.
[2:52:39] AzureCatalyst: Surely 󠀀
[2:52:41] Helmzee: I think the big issue is this Lucian prio by C9, and the random desire to pair it with milio
[2:52:48] Slayra: Clueless surely
[2:52:48] canyon_55: apa not beating his otp allegations LUL
[2:52:51] Fissiccisst: Ziggs! dolphinYay I love ziggs
[2:52:54] killerpineapple1: no
[2:52:56] killerpineapple1: its 14.3
[2:52:57] osrskuzzy: nope
[2:52:59] AzureCatalyst: SURELY HE WOULD BUILD A TANKY MAOKAI
[2:53:01] Slayra: SURELY
[2:53:08] najafan: @Helmzee Why not Nami or Janna.
[2:53:09] Fissiccisst: he is good, and don't call him shirley
[2:53:12] najafan: Literally.
[2:53:25] killerpineapple1: and its not really a nerf there giving him more dmg on smash
[2:53:27] amped_15: I think team didn't trust Blazers on rell for this game after flyquest one. TL banned and tried dto force him o to rell and c9 got scared
[2:53:28] Helmzee: @najafan Vulcan sucks on enchanters
[2:53:28] JeeFour: @MonteCristo stop talking about mao, sup mao with like 56%wr right now
[2:53:28] killerpineapple1: and less sapliings
[2:53:28] Bloodtotem: C9 obssessed with the garbage lucian pick all weekend
[2:53:33] killerpineapple1: so i think hes still good
[2:53:38] najafan: @Helmzee And Milio is.....?
[2:53:40] canyon_55: players are mindcontrolled not to play him
[2:53:45] VerbalHorse: @Bloodtotem Yeah it makes 0 sense to me
[2:53:46] CupahJoJo: c9 has had shit drafts since last split
[2:53:47] SlothFetish: Lillia is more fun
[2:53:49] killerpineapple1: whats blabers winrate
[2:53:50] killerpineapple1: on the moa
[2:53:50] Helmzee: @najafan Correct they should have just gone Naut
[2:53:51] zPostModern: put vulcan back on melee supports and stop berserker from playing lucian

[2:54:03] killerpineapple1: you should look at his winrate on mao
[2:54:04] btoastmanl: Of all the champs they could have chosen..
[2:54:08] Bloodtotem: C9 decided to play through bot lane all weekend which didn't work once
[2:54:23] boogieismyman: I mean you want c9 to play through fudge?
[2:54:25] Knait0: Lucian going even or losing lane KEKW
[2:54:28] l1ght0heav3n: @ashiimoto melee supports would let blaber carry more but apparently that’s not allowed anymore
[2:54:31] Slayra: meow kai
[2:54:39] killerpineapple1: yyup
[2:54:47] killerpineapple1: he won 13 games in a row or someshit
[2:54:47] archie7497: Lmao I got in a 1.5 hour nap and you are still on c9
[2:54:54] Badseed31: Make sure you watch apa interview at the end it's a banger
[2:54:54] AzureCatalyst: 13 games in a row jesus
[2:54:58] Bloodtotem: @boogieismyman yes, or the mid/jng which was smashing the first 3 games
[2:55:02] mikalhaze: didnt wanna fuck his WR up, i respect it
[2:55:18] najafan: And also Vulcan could just go Nami.
[2:55:19] mikejanderson: this maokai champ is too good
[2:55:24] NaNiwaSC2: when are we gonna watch weibo, the real goats
[2:55:24] mikejanderson: cheats the game
[2:55:34] Helmzee: Biggest issue right now for C9 is 1. Drafting 2. Itemization and 2. Limited champ pools
[2:55:35] rfarleydude97: Mithy drafting is some straight shit lol
[2:55:40] Helmzee: 3*
[2:55:40] Saephon: this weekend hurt my soul
[2:55:46] killerpineapple1: i think the team ints the draft super hard
[2:55:48] oddlookn: @najafan nami is fake millio is just better with Lucian
[2:55:48] osrskuzzy: more like a knee slapper
[2:55:48] spinifex: the range on tl looks good
[2:55:51] Ichigeki1: like what is c9's coach doing during this kinda of draft lol
[2:55:55] leamfor: Say it with me @MonteCristo "He is griefing"
[2:56:00] Teemees: Maybe the lower clear speed made hitting breakpoints harder
[2:56:06] zen__cloud: do you think mithy/hai are the ones deciding these drafts?
[2:56:08] Bloodtotem: @Helmzee i dont think limited champ pools is an issue, they are just drafting like garbage
[2:56:10] ThatLatvianGuy: @rfarleydude97 man thinks he drafting for s7 g2
[2:56:10] jayhow24: do the players have much say in select or do the coaches have all say
[2:56:14] killerpineapple1: not even the coach its like the players oh i want this and that and they dont stick to the plan
[2:56:18] enreves: Blaber doesnt strike me as a Lillia player
[2:56:19] leamfor: YEP
[2:56:23] najafan: @oddlookn Nami does engage and disengage which this comp needs.
[2:56:26] Aoyos_: @Teemees You still see it often elsewhere
[2:56:31] Helmzee: @Bloodtotem Fudge can't play Udyr a power pick top right now. And Vulcan is abysmal on any enchanter
[2:56:31] rfarleydude97: @ThatLatvianGuy LMFAO TRUE
[2:56:36] killerpineapple1: @jayhow24 if its arrogance is there im sure the players pick there champs
[2:56:41] mikejanderson: i would think that berserker wants to play lucian
[2:56:49] fruge2: wait no shot
[2:56:50] Bloodtotem: @Helmzee lol what? he was playing it like all week 1 and 2
[2:56:53] fruge2: did c9 lose this game too?
[2:56:56] TheOnymous: Are C9 just blowing people up in scrims?
[2:57:03] oddlookn: @najafan it’s not really the engage they need but true it’s atleast something
[2:57:07] Slayra: "APA is just a one trick Ziggs" surely that means you just ban it, right? Clueless
[2:57:11] Helmzee: @Bloodtotem And his itemization was awful on it. People found counters and he never actually learned the champ or itemization on it
[2:57:12] SugarSlapper: Oof
[2:57:15] enreves: Throwjopyun
[2:57:22] SomeFerretGuy: xdd
[2:57:24] fruge2: Aware APA
[2:57:25] archie7497: But this c9 draft is no engage + outranged + not 3 winning lanes
[2:57:26] Knait0: Fun fact, TL is DESTROYING C9 on scrims
[2:57:26] leamfor: Blaber was 7-3 on Lillia in 2021.
[2:57:42] killerpineapple1: if he wins that proves apas points
[2:57:50] AzureCatalyst: Let's just give the one trick his one trick champ Clueless Surely nothing will go wrong
[2:58:09] TheOnymous: Is it because C9 are on red side?
[2:58:16] VerbalHorse: Heard TL is destroying T1 in scrims
[2:58:18] killerpineapple1: another barrier game
[2:58:28] ChristianFromTheNorth: Just getting back into LOL & I see this legend streaming! Takes me take to the SKT T1 K days. THE GREAT MONTE CRISTO! Hope ur doing well man!

[2:59:00] Aoyos_: Lee kick can be used to disengage and then you just let ziggs do ziggs stuff
[2:59:04] squires: Surely you don't need engage against Ziggs and Aphelios
[2:59:14] profound23: how is c9 3-3 with this roster
[2:59:15] ThatLatvianGuy: @ChristianFromTheNorth getting back is not something i'd recommend but you're in the right place for it

[2:59:23] Knait0: Almost no egange vs 3 disengage tools, disaster
[2:59:25] jrotaku_: udyr gods or cant deal with udyr
[2:59:25] HexBlast: and yet fudge managed to lose with udyr...
[2:59:31] najafan: No, people are just bad at punishing udyr

[3:00:53] Bloodtotem: teams need to just not pick it
[3:00:59] h4root: Riot is guilty of Federal H1B Fraud / Violations
[3:01:11] balance_cs: Is TL just the LCK retirement home?
[3:01:11] jorahaha: Winning lucian is the only thing they didn't try
[3:01:42] btoastmanl: Just finished your latest episodes of Power Spike and Summoners, hoping the 4 horseman is a banger
[3:02:03] killerpineapple1: it is
[3:02:04] SomeFerretGuy: excuse me sirs yeon won on lucian yesterday. sure as heck wasn't deserved but it happened. kind of like zeka winning with corki
[3:02:05] killerpineapple1: so dam good
[3:02:09] KingTyonidas: right different forms. NA lucian, EU lucian. still havent found the form where they play the actual champ lucian yet though. maybe one day
[3:02:09] killerpineapple1: i watched it today
[3:02:09] notzoombagaming: it was slightly depressing tho
[3:02:14] mjoll_the_hotness: oh boy PepeLaugh
[3:02:17] Aoyos_: @btoastmanl Richard went off harder than usual
[3:02:18] btoastmanl: Which have been huge and ongoing
[3:02:20] killerpineapple1: it was very eye opening to what actually goes on
[3:02:23] Clyde1500: overwatch layoffs Sadge
[3:02:27] h4root: pia they'd replace u with Ai from Nvidia GPUs if they could
[3:02:28] stalfos25: I loved all the rants in that episode
[3:02:30] catanenjoyer: @MonteCristo thoughts on fudge these games?
[3:02:35] h4root: don't forget its an anti humanist globalist cult
[3:02:36] AdmiralReggie: Smoge
[3:02:37] azzlo3: summary of four horseman: richard lewis rants for 4 hours and its worth every second of it lol
[3:02:42] strogi50: the cult of Riot talk was scary
[3:02:43] killerpineapple1: im still stuck on that  spiritual mediation rub and tugs
[3:02:46] mjoll_the_hotness: magic
[3:02:49] killerpineapple1: so dam funny
[3:02:51] enreves: Not just Riot

[3:02:53] killerpineapple1: so dam weird
[3:02:53] h4root: its a cult
[3:02:53] leamfor: This is like Blaber's 12th Lillia game. Where is LCS's stats person to correct that lmao
[3:02:54] JuCiEe19: wonder why that is
[3:02:55] raowil: quite the coincidence
[3:02:58] enreves: Thats every company
[3:03:05] najafan: @h4root Could you tone it down please?
[3:03:08] Slayra: that just means all the executives are doing a great job Clueless
[3:03:08] mikalhaze: the people who make the most money never get fired, and when they do they get a golden parachute
[3:03:22] boogieismyman: Its never the executives fault, duhhh, its not their responsibility to run the company right?
[3:03:24] Kaniskion: top execs salaries only increasing throguh tough times SadgeCry
[3:03:34] CupahJoJo: its like banking industry, you use a specific managerial level as the scape goat which keepos everyone above safe
[3:03:34] Fissiccisst: Remember, riots a woke company though LUL
[3:03:40] StuntmanStan: what do you think about swifties gnar
[3:03:44] Knait0: Meanwhile in RIOT WHAT IF we make all league players have to use vanguard, so we can sell their data to the highest bider Clueless
[3:03:46] madiiiman: sometimes I wake up and remember that Riot could have killed off Kespa for good. and instead they threw them a lifeline and made them immortal
[3:03:50] ThatLatvianGuy: execs can only fall upwards TrollDespair
[3:03:55] killerpineapple1: you lose so much

[3:04:03] Lamynator: @madiiiman not familiar with that one, can you elaborate?
[3:04:05] killerpineapple1: better to just play it out if someone decides to do it
[3:04:07] dbxnaato: pretty sneaky play by TL

[3:04:29] MissingMatter: @Knait0 Oh, I can't run Vanguard, so I haven't installed LoL on my new computer.
[3:04:33] killerpineapple1: And Apa can cover with ult too
[3:04:35] mikalhaze: yea got them chasing a shadow
[3:04:36] CupahJoJo: would thjey swap to avoid levl 6 power spike of lucian?
[3:04:36] Nytrodark: KEKW power ranking
[3:04:40] killerpineapple1: its a super aware
[3:04:43] madiiiman: @lamynator Kespa was all but dead when league pro scene was starting out. Riot was warned by Monte and others not to give them their business. it was the one chance to kill off the group for good. riot didn’t listen
[3:04:46] gravitum_uwu: a bit over 1k on yt and twitch for vod reviews, that’s crazy to me. keep it up!
[3:04:47] madiiiman: and Kespa is bad
[3:04:47] zlrenyth: is vulcan the curse of fly and c9

[3:05:41] weenteen1: who/what is Kespa?
[3:05:44] rilsolo: fired em prob
[3:05:49] gravitum_uwu: maybe he just wants to lol
[3:05:52] notzoombagaming: probly to fuck with him
[3:05:55] DanielFromLA: @MonteCristo wasnt he learning how to pbp last season?
[3:05:56] kerokerogrips: Emiley Rand has been on the cast more and more , glad to at least see that change
[3:05:57] madiiiman: Kespa basically owns Korean esports
[3:05:59] Saephon: They just wanna force the same people to do 4 jobs for no extra pay
[3:06:01] killerpineapple1: nope lol
[3:06:04] Fissiccisst: They promise a whole extra 5 dollars
[3:06:07] CupahJoJo: i miss pastry time play by play
[3:06:08] Lamynator: my understanding is Kespa still exists, but it basically exists in name, it doesn't really exert any influence anymore
[3:06:08] najafan: Kespa = Korean ESports ASsociation
[3:06:09] ThatLatvianGuy: ngl rafa triggers me a little
[3:06:10] trespasur: not a fan of rafa tbh
[3:06:10] Warzard908: can't pay the new guys NODDERS

[3:06:25] imainleesin: @balance_cs LUL
[3:06:25] VerbalHorse: He was yeah a couple casts
[3:06:25] rilsolo: he was play by playing some wow arenas last year so maybe he thought he could do league
[3:06:25] Cabbygt: He was one a couple of weekends
[3:06:25] najafan: Er, Players Association
[3:06:26] Warzard908: yes
[3:06:31] zunderbunder: am I tripping or did Azael cast WoW arena at one point
[3:06:32] killerpineapple1: but since there pays are weird im sure kobe and flowers get asked if they want to do it
[3:06:34] imainleesin: Flowers shoulda be perma play by play
[3:06:34] azzlo3: grand chieftain of lol esports azael has dcreed he must be on every cast

[3:06:52] Warzard908: idk
[3:06:57] Infinite_Winter4: HeyGuys
[3:06:57] madiiiman: when broodwars was falling off, and league was starting up, Kespa was all but finished. they were saved by riot giving them the rights to run the league scene in Korea
[3:07:03] Beigeish: these tweets gave me aids
[3:07:04] imainleesin: these tweets are so cringe man
[3:07:05] mob_us: you wouldnt get it -lcs probably
[3:07:06] fruge2: 8 team league and it's still bo1 as well xdd
[3:07:12] Nytrodark: xdd
[3:07:22] SomeFerretGuy: tl ran c9 around the map with macro this game
[3:07:25] huxti: TL laneswapped multiple times this game for drake and then back to top for grub respawn tempo
[3:07:26] huxti: so insane
[3:07:39] huxti: ACTUALLY good lcs macro
[3:07:39] SomeFerretGuy: :')
[3:07:40] bobby_deol: xdd
[3:07:51] SomeFerretGuy: brings a tear to my eye
[3:07:55] Lamynator: Is it the same Kespa that had created the korean sweathouse conditions of Broodwar?  By that I mean are they still running those really shitty conditions
[3:07:59] x40calx: tell na get of the luc it’s a troll pick the fact c9 went back to it after getting stomped the day before tell them change it up
[3:08:08] madiiiman: rhe same Kespa yes
[3:08:16] mjoll_the_hotness: macro keeping micro on chokehold for the superior strat
[3:08:21] najafan: @Lamynator Uh, they *were* in S3-S5ish.
[3:08:28] najafan: I believe things got better.
[3:08:37] madiiiman: they say it got better
[3:08:44] madiiiman: there’s literally no way to prove either way
[3:08:45] Aoyos_: The proxy farm gives TL bot lane plenty of time to swap top without losing cs while it forces Gnar to stay longer to not lose anything
[3:08:48] balance_cs: @MonteCristo Does Riot not know how to monetize LCK? I don't understand why they are making stupid changes to LCS to attempt to revive it when it mostly boils down to the region having no international results and are bad which is something Riot can't fix.
[3:08:51] madiiiman: lck obv has good conditions

[3:09:18] Sharpshow: should c9 just do drag first swap?
[3:09:18] huxti: keep watchjing monte they do it again in like 1 inute for grubs and works perfectly again LOL
[3:09:27] hellohihi145: @montecristo TL has best macro in lcs BY FAR
[3:09:27] CupahJoJo: who calls for this play, the jungler?
[3:09:28] SomeFerretGuy: patently untrue, na never had results internationally and it was the mos tpopular league at one point
[3:09:34] Saephon: this 8 team LCS Is such a better average skill level than its been in years
[3:09:45] najafan: Yeah, hard to look into the T2+T3 conditions in Korea systematically.
[3:09:58] najafan: I think LS has made allusions to it still not being great.
[3:10:00] balance_cs: @SomeFerretGuy Yeah and everyone stopped watching because its no fun to root for your region when you know they will lose every time
[3:10:03] QuackTheDuck: umti is pretty good
[3:10:12] Bloodtotem: Could C9 have done drake instead of swapping themselves?
[3:10:20] MellowMelos: If TL keep this up can they be a top 2 team?
[3:10:25] spaceprincesssss: you think they speak in all korean like last year
[3:10:26] Aoyos_: Umti came to revive TL and only left the corpse of BRO in Korea
[3:10:27] killerpineapple1: @SomeFerretGuy i think it was the most popular at that time cuz it was almost impossible to watch the games from other regions at the start
[3:10:28] Slayra: it was me :) i called the play :)
[3:10:38] Knait0: BRO Topside sinergy GIGACHAD
[3:10:43] confusedblue_: @spaceprincesssss they aint as umti speaks engish
[3:10:53] QuackTheDuck: I need BRO to win so I can spam ok bro
[3:10:53] SomeFerretGuy: umti has great english
[3:10:56] Keltai_: BRO GIGACHAD MENTIONED GIGACHAD
[3:11:07] spaceprincesssss: still might be easier to comm in native language
[3:11:08] hellohihi145: TLs macro this split already looks mikes ahead of the rest of the west
[3:11:10] MellowMelos: @spaceprincesssss If I recall correctly Umti speaks English well so probably not
[3:11:15] hellohihi145: miles*
[3:11:24] killerpineapple1: @SomeFerretGuy he has a great interview a day or two ago and his English is very good
[3:11:29] Aoyos_: Umti will forever be a player worth following
[3:11:32] AntiquusTonitrus_3: impact wit the map plays
[3:11:36] SomeFerretGuy: watch this video for some umti personality https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlMfJHYYOwE

[3:11:44] QuackTheDuck: Can Apa only play ziggs?
[3:12:02] SomeFerretGuy: @QuackTheDuck if you'r a one trick why not play your trick if its up
[3:12:09] btoastmanl: Thank you
[3:12:12] imainleesin: truuuu
[3:12:14] QuackTheDuck: @SomeFerretGuy ok fair
[3:12:14] AzureCatalyst: AAAA
[3:12:14] CupahJoJo: its fake tweets lol
[3:12:15] Infinite_Winter4: guys ,do na lol orgs sell merchandise like - jerseys?

[3:12:37] Lamynator: I want them to show the real tweets, not that fake stuff
[3:12:38] azzlo3: they're not even good tweets either lmao
[3:12:41] kAtz124: not thing is happening tho

[3:14:26] ThatLatvianGuy: why do the tweets and shit have to take so much space? AAAA
[3:14:28] killerpineapple1: i dont think the C9 has one unified voice its like a classroom with a bunch of kids and Vulcan trying to teach them what wards and lane pressure is

[3:15:32] AzureCatalyst: @CIGAFLY RIOT wouldn't let him be affiliated with their franchised teams and it would be a pay downgrade for him to do that
[3:15:33] Warzard908: hmmm i wonder if c9 still scrims against their cl team or if they just dropped it
[3:15:41] Aoyos_: @spucky117 In a lot of cases it doesn't go past level 1 set ups

[3:26:22] spucky117: LOL
[3:26:23] l1ght0heav3n: @killerpineapple1 the only games they’ve won this split are when he plays carries or bruisers
[3:26:33] QuackTheDuck: @Aoyos_ flash kick? why is he flash kicking?
[3:26:34] najafan: I'm still all in on The Prisoner. It's about a James Bond style spy during the Cold War who retires and is kidnapped away to a Kafka-esque village where they try to extract information from him.

[3:27:32] QuackTheDuck: @Aoyos_ his team coming from the right, if anything he just kicks he doesnt need to flash

[3:30:27] Dekharen: @Dekharen @jerckysminion Well I think the item itself is not good enough atm particularly compared to other tank items, but if the stats were better I feel like it'd fit that kind of early game tank that falls off

[3:34:50] notzoombagaming: oh shit
[3:34:52] notzoombagaming: thats nice
[3:35:11] TheOnymous: @jerckysminion You're reading the wrong manga
[3:35:12] hellohihi145: are we gunna get a verdict on c9 after this? post mortem?
[3:35:13] gopko: c9 has been very disappointing
[3:35:14] SomeFerretGuy: do you watch bmkibler gym streams
[3:35:14] notzoombagaming: no more horny now i am gym rat-jercky 2024
[3:35:17] SomeFerretGuy: PauseChamp
[3:35:23] killerpineapple1: its all conditional CC
[3:35:28] kuxalul: and fudge isnt tanky at all, they can oneshot this gnar at this point
[3:35:29] awoogawooogawoo: @MonteCristo are you a blaber believer?
[3:35:34] killerpineapple1: not one button of there leads to hard CC
[3:35:41] jerckysminion: @notzoombagaming your literally 2 years behind bro
[3:35:42] killerpineapple1: need 2 buttons min
[3:35:47] serawrbear: @MonteCristo but monte what other AP jungler could possibly have given them engage
[3:35:48] SomeFerretGuy: this fight is so well played by apa
[3:35:48] mudboy: Apa played really well here
[3:35:48] najafan: I believe they call themselves blab-lievers
[3:35:50] Dekharen: @jerckysminion really depends imo. I'd completely agree if we're comparing I got Reincarnated as a pebble vs Akira, but there's also some good stuff :>
[3:35:59] imainleesin: Why is blaber there?
[3:36:00] notzoombagaming: to be fair u rarely talk in the richcord thats the only time i talk to you
[3:36:04] MissingMatter: @serawrbear They have Ori, so they don't need an AP jungler.
[3:36:12] imainleesin: crabber moment
[3:36:19] kerokerogrips: fudge kept misusing his mega gnar timings
[3:36:31] jerckysminion: @Dekharen the last actual good manga i read was diamond no ace
[3:36:31] kuxalul: he solo ults adc with mikaels
[3:36:35] killerpineapple1: and corjj buys mikales first
[3:36:36] gabougabougm66: he already ulted Aph
[3:36:37] enreves: APA breaks their ankles here
[3:36:38] Apathetic_Brent: I feel like this has to be a mental boom from C9.  Surely they come back in the second half/playoffs
[3:36:39] HASTERIOUS: blaber already used it lol
[3:36:40] carlthemanacorn: these lucian comps are kinda like old cj entus comps with coco, where the engage was azir with shen ult. You just have to be cracked out of your mind to make it work
[3:36:40] killerpineapple1: for that lillia ult
[3:36:42] fIuffee: weebs out Stare
[3:36:42] gabougabougm66: Got cleansed by Mikaels

[3:36:59] najafan: @jerckysminion Have any recs to scratch that Baccano itch?
[3:37:01] HASTERIOUS: i mean
[3:37:01] jerckysminion: the only manga i currently still read is hajime no ippo & kingdom
[3:37:02] HASTERIOUS: mikaels
[3:37:04] Giiino: 2nd worst c9 ult of that fight
[3:37:05] killerpineapple1: gets clensed
[3:37:06] awoogawooogawoo: xdd
[3:37:08] killerpineapple1: and yeon
[3:37:08] kuxalul: yeon with mikaels

[3:37:47] l1ght0heav3n: C9 legit look like they just installed league it’s sad
[3:37:47] HASTERIOUS: jojo and fudge not on the same page
[3:37:48] awoogawooogawoo: OOOO
[3:37:53] imainleesin: that shockwave lmao
[3:37:55] Dekharen: @jerckysminion I'd highly recommend Apothecary Diaries from this season; it's a sort of mix between a slice of life and political drama and the art is excellent !
[3:37:55] PKuall4life: *NRG/TL
[3:37:56] HASTERIOUS: and he whiffed his ult LOL
[3:37:57] Sharpshow: inexcusable for a pro to be off hourglass timing by that much
[3:37:58] gopko: ?????
[3:38:00] killerpineapple1: its not even close
[3:38:02] TastyAMG: That shockwave was horrid
[3:38:02] gopko: that timing wasn't even close
[3:38:05] imainleesin: LUL

[3:38:40] Dekharen: Monte you're 1/4th of the way of having more viewers than LCS academy PepeLaugh
[3:38:45] kerokerogrips: nah fudge has bad rage management
[3:38:47] SomeFerretGuy: what fucking prep do you need to know you ban the one trick
[3:38:47] killerpineapple1: not picking maokai this game is so troll
[3:38:50] killerpineapple1: like soooooo bad
[3:38:53] Halalpillango: tbh these misplays look like frustration plays, they cant do anything but feel like they have to
[3:38:55] kuxalul: lucian engage
[3:39:00] fIuffee: They have lucian W for engage, no?
[3:39:03] hellohihi145: imagine if c9 had maokai
[3:39:04] Bloodtotem: @kerokerogrips all of NA does, Gnar rarely does well in NA
[3:39:08] halscarr: blaber played engage past 3 games and was disgustingly bad
[3:39:11] DankWizard420: I cant help but think lucian millio is giga bait
[3:39:11] killerpineapple1: imagine if they just had mao ult lol
[3:39:13] hayjaw: this lillia R usage is very sus
[3:39:13] najafan: @fIuffee True
[3:39:16] gopko: at this point mithy and fudge are a morale debuff at best
[3:39:19] killerpineapple1: would be a completely different game
[3:39:19] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips TRUE AND BASED
[3:39:19] leamfor: This is false btw, it was in Summer 2018

[3:39:55] letho1410: is ad jungle not better with ori?
[3:39:59] najafan: And Blaber is 14 and 2 on Mao
[3:39:59] fIuffee: maokai is a notoriously difficult champ to play which is why they didn't pick him
[3:40:00] HomemadeShiv: NA just gets bored...
[3:40:02] jerckysminion: @kuxalul true
[3:40:03] killerpineapple1: im pretty sure blaber picks his champ too
[3:40:04] NaNiwaSC2: tbh if they picked ziggs they couldve maybe fought for it
[3:40:05] DankWizard420: wish we'd see leona again SadgeCry
[3:40:09] supremeekko: 1
[3:40:10] killerpineapple1: just slammed the lillia
[3:40:12] Bloodtotem: @MonteCristo did you see Mithy's tweet?
[3:40:13] jayhow24: will the coaches take responsibility for this?
[3:40:14] carlthemanacorn: these lucian comps are kinda like old cj entus comps with coco, where the engage was azir with shen ult. You just have to be cracked out of your mind to make it work
[3:40:25] Tpro83: Make your own LCS, with blackjack and hookers.
[3:40:26] imainleesin: So Lillia was basically ego pick?
[3:40:29] enreves: c9s ego is greater than their desire to win YEP
[3:40:29] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Their ego said we can beat them without the boring picks
[3:40:29] blaargh124: still they only lost baron bc blaber egoed a crab and lost all his hp and flash for it

[3:40:47] gopko: yes
[3:40:47] imainleesin: Mithy lmao
[3:40:49] DanielFromLA: no shit
[3:40:51] Dekharen: tbf I think the biggest problem with the lucian comps is that NA/EU teams have no idea how to have a significant lead in lane with it lol
[3:40:52] leamfor: AINTNOYWAY
[3:40:53] DemonioStrada: why are player cams hazy?
[3:41:08] killerpineapple1: into one man lillia ult again
[3:41:10] tommywc3: i think c9 should play ezreal mid next time to make this draft even worse
[3:41:10] awoogawooogawoo: yeon so good Kappa
[3:41:11] HASTERIOUS: and still couldnt kill the zigs
[3:41:17] carlthemanacorn: @najafan ye im just saying thats why these comps look so different in the east
[3:41:18] zPostModern: imagine if vulcan was rakan or naut or something human
[3:41:20] Dekharen: GNAR POWERPLAY
[3:41:22] killerpineapple1: mikales is such a good item this game
[3:41:23] gopko: what is this comp supposed to do even
[3:41:28] Clyde1500: I don't get how you watch yesterday's game, see lucian do nothing and think "yeah let's run it back"
[3:41:31] Warzard908: 2 man he got udyr i think
[3:41:32] jerckysminion: shakes head
[3:41:32] Aoyos_: 2 man ult this time, be fair to Blaber
[3:41:34] kuxalul: i wonder if they actually think that engage was good or were just like "we have to fight this"
[3:41:35] fjord3: gnar ult and ori ult on ziggs and cant even kill him
[3:41:38] DankWizard420: lillia is busted rn aswell Sadge
[3:41:41] Komarimasita: WE GOT EM
[3:41:47] spinifex: clean kick lol
[3:41:47] SomeFerretGuy: FeelsAmazingMan
[3:41:50] enreves: Draft is part of it but c9 is not playing well either
[3:41:54] gopko: it's disgusting
[3:41:54] killerpineapple1: @DankWizard420 maybe in soloq but in pros is so troll
[3:41:54] l1ght0heav3n: @dankwizard420 not when you can’t go in
[3:41:54] Giiino: ok show me your homework now

[3:41:59] kuxalul: draf diff
[3:42:07] SomeFerretGuy: reminder watch the interview
[3:42:07] HASTERIOUS: the macro was so good because C9 let them walk all over them
[3:42:07] unknown87644: c9 combined kills across 3 games was 12 this week @MonteCristo
[3:42:12] Professional_Aellith: C9 running like a finely tuned Tesla Cyber Truck
[3:42:12] RedLine__05: opinion on talking shit about a one trick, and the losing to said one trick?
[3:42:13] dowiet: ma-ma-ma-ma-macroblasteddddddd
[3:42:13] fIuffee: This game proved that LS is not fit to be C9's coach. This draft was AWFUL
[3:42:15] HASTERIOUS: there was no resistance in C9
[3:42:16] DankWizard420: @killerpineapple1 well yeah that's always been true, it's a soloq pick like..kayn YEP
[3:42:18] xiaok1234: umti masterclass
[3:42:19] kuxalul: ziggs otp
[3:42:20] enreves: Here we go PepeLaugh

[3:42:35] DankWizard420: xdd
[3:42:36] NaNiwaSC2: doubt this wouldve gone like this if ruler was on lucian OpieOP
[3:42:41] killerpineapple1: @DankWizard420 imagine in solo q if your teammates go for the teamfight instread of kills

[3:45:08] Saucy____Boy: team liquid Honda

[3:46:15] imainleesin: Wait they did another Vayne pick?
[3:46:23] TastyAMG: @commando1814 can never have enough pockets for the sockets
[3:46:26] Dekharen: @Adanion which french accent
[3:46:27] najafan: @imainleesin Nah, this is that first one
[3:46:29] Knait0: If c9 had Lilia, they would be fine this draft I think
[3:46:51] MissingMatter: @Dekharen In his LCS Live Patch ad bit.

[3:48:19] najafan: Xayah ban?
[3:48:19] kuxalul: you cant play ekko jungle?
[3:48:24] killerpineapple1: also picked 5 melee champs pretty much
[3:48:24] Bloodtotem: and we know JoJo can play Trist cause he plays it in another game lol
[3:48:32] enreves: C9 is fantastic, just need to work on draft, communication, map awareness, laning, vision control, csing, poking, landing skillshots, objective control, early game, mid game, late game, ganking, and getting kills.
[3:48:35] QuackTheDuck: What about Lucian for dominating the lane phase instead of vayne? @MonteCristo
[3:48:46] VerbalHorse: This was ego draft after winning first 3 games
[3:48:54] fumse_tv: @MonteCristo What about kogmaw mid last pick for c9? AP or AD
[3:49:00] someshitidk57: they picked vayne because it's different and controversial, classic american move
[3:49:00] Dekharen: @QuackTheDuck vayne was top, lucian isnt gonna kill tanks either anyway
[3:49:13] Dekharen: @QuackTheDuck I mean mid zz
[3:49:16] MissingMatter: Vayne was mid.
[3:49:20] killerpineapple1: would have shoved the lane sooo much better
[3:49:26] Keltai_: is LCS still a bunch of Bo1s?

[3:49:53] dah777: would elise be good if mao was banned?
[3:50:04] Dekharen: @killerpineapple1 ya but lucian is short range too and doesn't kill tanks, it doesn't solve any of the problems monte brought up, only trist does
[3:50:09] QuackTheDuck: What do you think of ezreal mid?
[3:50:17] kuxalul: dah777 nah champ doesnt scale good enough i think
[3:50:22] Aoyos_: If only Anivia existed
[3:50:28] 0RE0N: @MonteCristo can you go Aatrox mid there and pick something for top?
[3:50:32] IEatLamas: Never see any other ad than trist mid in Korea for a reason
[3:50:42] ploetze97: Would yone work?
[3:50:43] killerpineapple1: @killerpineapple1 were talking about mid match vs sion or ud literally anything would of been better than vayne
[3:50:54] leamfor: If only we had a mage player that would smurf this.
[3:51:03] SomeFerretGuy: doesn't that leave lillia or c9?
[3:51:06] Knait0: Why would favor maokai over brand tho
[3:51:07] SomeFerretGuy: for*
[3:51:22] killerpineapple1: @killerpineapple1 and you build 2 runics and what does corki do he not going to anything
[3:51:27] fjord3: anivia :)
[3:51:51] apshacotumor: c9 has the most dogshit draft in history
[3:52:15] killerpineapple1: vulcans face knows
[3:52:18] killerpineapple1: he is fucked
[3:52:21] killerpineapple1: his face lol
[3:52:24] canyon_55: Saved
[3:52:42] fjord3: vulcan looks like he has accepted the end AngelThump
[3:52:43] Aoyos_: You need constant miracle multiman sleeps
[3:52:47] huxti: core just first items mikaels and then u have no engage LMAO
[3:52:54] apshacotumor: Lilia ult for engage is so unreliable
[3:52:55] SomeFerretGuy: did fudge use ult more than once?
[3:52:58] Clyde1500: vulcan praying to any god that can hear him
[3:53:03] najafan: Nami instead of Milio here plzzzz.
[3:53:14] canyon_55: @SomeFerretGuy for wave clear maybe
[3:53:14] Bloodtotem: @SomeFerretGuy probably not since he never really got a chance to
[3:53:18] najafan: Western players can't play Nami, but dear lord it's needed here.
[3:53:33] Knait0: 3 losses, 3 lucian games KEK
[3:53:36] Halalpillango: western lucian Aware
[3:53:37] fjord3: zac could be good here
[3:53:38] apshacotumor: I don’t understand the gnar pick at all, like why
[3:53:57] killerpineapple1: @apshacotumor gnar was fine he just had no engage to follow up on
[3:53:57] uNiq_qontroL: If C9 picks Nami doesnt TL then play Milio Aphelios? They'd be even more screwed
[3:54:08] l1ght0heav3n: @fjord3 blaber is good with Zac so it’s not allowed
[3:54:30] apshacotumor: Zac top is pretty good too
[3:54:30] kuxalul: lillia is farm heavy, spica talked about her and you just fight when you have R
[3:54:30] DankWizard420: it's #1 jungle YEP
[3:54:34] 0RE0N: ap mid + ap jungle FailFish
[3:54:39] Bloodtotem: based on Mithy's tweet i feel like C9's recent drafts were just clusterfucks and the team didnt really have a plan going into these games
[3:54:40] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:54:47] killerpineapple1: and its strong solo q cuz nobody targets corretly and lets her just run around doing w.e but when things are coordinated its so so so bad
[3:54:59] zPostModern: @apshacotumor fudge was the only engage. thge next best thing is lucian dashing in with ball
[3:55:04] killerpineapple1: like all of them XD
[3:55:18] najafan: @uNiq_qontroL I'm not convinced that Lulu->Milio in TL's comp is more important than Milio->Nami in C9's. C9 gets both engage and disengage from Nami.
[3:55:26] HASTERIOUS: I would have picked maokai and tf for C9
[3:55:39] AdeptShinobi: @Ashiimoto Kamikaze lucian
[3:55:55] LifeisPogChamp: Do you think the players tell the coach they want these champs?
[3:56:12] Bloodtotem: Cause Mithy is a garbage coach
[3:56:24] killerpineapple1: @LifeisPogChamp in c9s case yes absolutely
[3:56:34] littlebluejay: who is the c9 coach
[3:56:47] najafan: Mithy is C9's coach
[3:56:51] killerpineapple1: berserker has had 2 bad lucian games and then goes for a third
[3:56:53] aramister: Hard to play from behind comps
[3:57:03] apshacotumor: Lucian milio into nautilus was terrible last game too
[3:57:14] shedo_47: to me with incidents in fnatic, now C9 how is he still such contested coach
[3:57:16] IAmDiabeticus: Dude this is why I love Monte
[3:57:19] najafan: That Naut hook, for instance
[3:57:43] Adanion: theyve had this sort of elitist attitude for like 2 years now it feels
[3:57:43] YungPecku: C9 really should take every other team serious, they're obviously not good enough to slack off
[3:57:51] najafan: Or forcing baron when they just shouldn't.
[3:57:53] Aoyos_: Against IMT they just stop doing anything and keep farming, probably expecting to just out-teamfight IMT and win off that
[3:58:10] najafan: They're trying to hands diff every other team.
[3:58:17] Aoyos_: @najafan Absolutely
[3:58:19] Bloodtotem: C9 has felt lost for the last 2 weeks
[3:58:32] YungPecku: @najafan literally learned nothing from international play yet again
[3:58:45] Bloodtotem: @YungPecku NA teams never learn from worlds
[3:58:45] aramister: The random steal as well
[3:58:48] apshacotumor: how do we go from god tier with Zven and Emenes too this with Jojo Vulcan
[3:58:51] LifeisPogChamp: C9 thinks every game is a scrim. They can just yolo out mechanics
[3:59:03] teemu113: @apshacotumor because vulcan is overrated af in 2024
[3:59:07] YungPecku: @Bloodtotem yeah I know its stupid
[3:59:11] tommywc3: wow he said that the golden boy of NA blabber played bad?
[3:59:48] killerpineapple1: @apshacotumor honestly it looks like berserker just goes in without saying anything vulcans like backing off then he just goes in with an e and dies to naut varus

[3:59:51] Bloodtotem: @tommywc3 Blaber has bad games but usually the rest of his team isnt playing like garbage like C9 is right now
[4:00:08] aramister: But blabber and berserker did not push their lead vs imt

[4:00:39] l1ght0heav3n: cause he’s not an engage player
[4:00:45] killerpineapple1: blabers ego last season was HUGE
[4:00:46] Adanion: zvens attitude alone feels immensely valuable to the team, the guy wants to win and get better, at least thats the vibe from his interviews
[4:00:50] killerpineapple1: carryed into this one
[4:00:50] apshacotumor: he does have like 100% winrate on Maokai historically why not just pick Maokai
[4:01:03] Knait0: Western Lucian LUL
[4:01:14] naocorrijo: they need to repeat 2016, drop top jg sup and bring back reapered... licorice tarzan jojo berserker zven

[4:37:25] najafan: @ThatLatvianGuy I do think something that's really helpful in approaching online discussions is realizing that some people just fundamentally never lived through the 2008 crisis, or even recently, during Covid, were still unaware of the economy.
[4:37:42] Len_xyz: oh if its tomorrow, there's a chance you can get to hear JDG voicecomms against LNG. They have been releasing voicecomms very quickly  for their matches

[4:40:51] najafan: Like, people now saying that 2017 is great just only makes sense if they just weren't cognizant of the real world at the time.
