[1:05:18] saDD3ath: @ipav999 why doesnt the botrk, nahoors, ragebalde build work?
[1:07:02] kurufeemo: @sadd3ath cause you can't really consistently auto in combat as a rule.
[1:07:14] kurufeemo: It's too short ranged
[1:08:49] kurufeemo: Also, on hit builds require a lot of time to do damage in a fight which teemo doesn't usually have
[1:10:32] Deportatsiya_iz_strany_Oz: gg
[1:11:33] twitchsuckstoday: it just feels bad buying a sheen
[1:12:26] kurufeemo: All the lichbane stats are really good for teemo

[2:15:42] Onimotw0: i would say ap so malph cant go full armor, but he could just go kaenic and counter all the magic damage anyway
[2:16:08] purifish: lvl 1 ignite is so weak

[2:57:44] kanellis_EUW: what about fleet ?
[3:00:23] iboo2300: What about dark harvest?
[3:10:17] Pitju99: I think compared to all the teemo players, you focus the most on avoiding to lose instead of trying to win
[3:12:05] nurse_irl: iPav - The Jose Mourinho of League
[3:14:47] Pitju99: and even the good players will mess up sometimes, but defensive style might not be able to punish
[3:20:04] Asketitt: PTA with ghost has both then no?
[3:21:12] Pitju99: it's really hard to play a perfect game of league
[3:22:08] Pitju99: if they were though, you are basically ok with a 50% winrate
[3:22:14] Pitju99: theyre as good as you
[3:24:49] Pitju99: I'm not even really talking about the rune, more like way of thinking
[3:26:40] Pitju99: yeah and it feels really bad
[3:26:49] Pitju99: ppl really do say that though
[3:27:21] Pitju99: I do think its more fun to think about it as well but idk if its the best soloq strategy
[3:29:28] Pitju99: yeah
[3:30:33] Pitju99: I think you would enjoy being an analyst for a pro team
[3:31:12] xxpops: i agree with that
[3:32:00] Pitju99: you already do the spreadsheets on stream lol
[3:32:16] Addinks: hey long time lurker, wanted to know what runes would you run vs riven? Have been losing the matchup recently
[3:32:58] Addinks: sounds good thanks
[3:34:23] Addinks: Would def make things easier
[3:35:54] Pitju99: even if they know where enemy jg is they wont ping it
[3:36:42] Pitju99: would rather blame the laner for dying, he shouldve known
[3:37:49] Layxo: I've actually only seen one french jg chall streamer do the ping of enemy jg rigth before ganks / objectives without vision
[3:37:51] pandasquadron69: pandasquadron69 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! wow 12months
[3:38:08] matiko280: Applecatrun
[3:41:00] Pitju99: also another thing is, if they gank you at an unexoected timing
[3:41:12] Pitju99: usually that means they lose farm so its not all bad
[3:43:44] matiko280: LUL
[3:44:49] Pitju99: he is tanking the cannon
[3:45:30] Pitju99: yeah with the flat armor the wave would hurt a lot less there
[3:45:35] Pitju99: season diff
[3:48:08] Pitju99: the mindgames EZ first 2 deaths was bait
[3:49:40] Pitju99: he couldve turned
[3:50:33] Pitju99: he wanted 1 for 1 maybe but ornn flashed
[3:50:39] Pitju99: greedy perhaps
[3:50:51] saberstriker: Ive seen Profane Kayn doing some crazy things , I saw Kayn kill an ADC in 1 q
[3:50:52] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[3:51:03] matiko280: jax was there though, maybe he though he would fight jax
[3:52:32] Pitju99: but I'm sure what fappy thinks is that he couldve avoided this by playing better
[3:52:39] Pitju99: so hes not gonna doubt his strategy
[3:52:42] saberstriker: If your team is all doing really well, and you aren't confident should you just play safe?
[3:52:48] Pitju99: which is kinda true for this game
[3:53:31] Flippykiller1337: Shibboooooooo, not very good in this situationnnnnn
[3:53:55] Flippykiller1337: Never D:
[3:54:37] saberstriker: its because
[3:54:45] saberstriker: it turns the way you are facing
[3:54:48] saberstriker: when you get in
[3:54:53] saberstriker: I think it is a bug
[3:55:32] Pitju99: maybe where is cursor is pointed
[3:55:36] Pitju99: his
[3:56:05] HiJerme: rng i guess
[3:56:34] TheHamOfSteel: how do you call smolder?
[3:57:30] matiko280: teemo troll SMH
[3:57:31] Pitju99: he did mess up tho
[3:58:08] saberstriker: The dragon gets his execute at 225 stacks so around 22-27 mins
[3:58:09] Pitju99: telling league players to be nice LUL
[3:58:46] saberstriker: Killing minions with his Q
[3:58:53] saberstriker: or abilities on enemy champs
[3:59:17] saberstriker: Yeah kind off
[3:59:22] Layxo: Veigar / nasus
[3:59:23] Pitju99: adc veigar
[3:59:53] BCDrums: his stack deals ap right?
[4:01:52] Pitju99: I think when fappy gets behind he's still counting on a mistake, maybe he can get a shutdown
[4:02:31] saberstriker: Lmao
[4:03:24] saberstriker: I joined late, who are we watching?
[4:05:50] IkiruToLive: Teemomo
[4:06:13] Pitju99: I do agree that losing state, less gold for me means focusing more on finishing items
[4:06:21] Pitju99: u have less to work with
[4:11:00] Pitju99: she is not allowed to fight back there
[4:11:30] Pitju99: yeah that guy is bad
[4:12:16] Pitju99: I guess you dont have to expect it just be ready for it
[4:12:31] Pitju99: if it happens
[4:13:04] cassava10: !opgg
[4:16:24] Pitju99: I wish too
[4:16:37] Pitju99: teemo is not good enough of a champion for thaz
[4:17:57] Pitju99: which means this could still work even better
[4:19:02] Pitju99: though I do think he still does it
[4:19:24] Pitju99: at least he tries
[4:20:09] Pitju99: lol he had bahn me in jg
[4:20:25] LtChezo: what is THE teemo for 2024

[4:44:21] Pitju99: YEP
[4:46:40] msq_p: are we studying?
[4:48:35] Pitju99: wouldnt exhaust be better for her than ghost
[4:48:53] Pitju99: if he wants combat summoner
[4:49:30] Pitju99: exhaust would also be good against the rest of taimos tram

[5:01:36] mklarnecistka: show us the perfect game

[5:03:16] Senpos: Do you miss the old Riftmaker? I liked that lifesteal a lot, as i make many mistakes, i was not punished too much
[5:03:24] Shanierd513: Ban smolder so your team doesn't int :)
[5:04:20] msq_p: if i had to pick one item to get it'd be hextech gunblade

[5:11:20] 291x: xddteemo
[5:11:58] Pitju99: I dont think its just the game length that makes it boring or fun
[5:12:21] MapucheEnjoyer: i dont mind that type of games though, i wish my enemies also surrender early when we are like 10 to 2 at 10 mins, they make everyine waste so much time
