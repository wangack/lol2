[2:21:10] willyoustfunow: simple really
[2:21:12] bladetrinity16: meow
[2:21:23] kovptr: @stunt Stunt you said few days ago Smolder supp is trolling. I just wanna tell you I won 3 games already with him in ranked. I take comet + ultimate hunter, max W then E. Full build is ZakZak, Ionian, Malignance, Liandry, Mortal Reminder and Horizon. His poke damage is insane and his ult with very short cooldown carry every teamfight.
[2:21:24] hiimawarii00: Hello meow
[2:21:43] denunciator: isn't smolder supp just kogmaw supp
[2:21:47] bladetrinity16: @denunciator since the nerfs yeah but everyone still builds it cause numbers go brr
[2:21:49] willyoustfunow: do i even have to
[2:22:26] bladetrinity16: @kovptr why mortal?
[2:22:28] denunciator: honestly I think proto is absurdly broken 2500 gold 110% gold eff AND a mobility active
[2:22:38] ThomasTheTwink: zyra dead we cheered
[2:22:42] Apostolique: Diana is too easy!
[2:23:04] kovptr: @bladetrinity16 because he has huge AP ratios but he does physical damage with every ability so at the end you need armor pen, not magic pen
[2:23:28] bladetrinity16: @bladetrinity16 then why not seryaldas for the slow and pen
[2:23:39] bladetrinity16: mortal is just a big waste
[2:23:51] ThomasTheTwink: they changed serylda pen to scale off lethality and the slow is only under 50% hp
[2:23:59] willyoustfunow: sus
[2:24:04] kovptr: seryldas is more expensive and armor pen from it stacks with lethality now, and you dont want lethality in this build
[2:24:05] twinkothy: kaceyWendy
[2:24:34] slyrz: how long do you think its going to take to test every champ? @stunt
[2:24:39] denunciator: I like that build but is malignance really worth it
[2:24:46] willyoustfunow: its obvious
[2:24:56] TrollAnnie_: i currently have a 9000% win rate on zilean sundered sky rush because the gold efficiency and HPV per auto is massive CAPYBARA
[2:25:02] sumthingsup: @kovptr i think you mean scales
[2:25:11] kovptr: yes sry
[2:25:24] kovptr: and his w/r already slows btw, so seryldas is pretty much a waste
[2:25:29] slyrz: thats why you play a couple of games
[2:25:41] aangles_: @kovptr just curious as to what you're trying to prove by playing smolder support.
[2:25:41] ThomasTheTwink: @TrollAnnie_ human papilloma virus per auto???
[2:25:47] bladetrinity16: fair enough
[2:25:56] TrollAnnie_: @ImTheFlowerYoureTheBee health per zilean GIGACAPY
[2:26:05] ThomasTheTwink: GIGACAPY
[2:26:14] bezarau: lol mundo is just so upset
[2:26:15] ana_lfabeta: does bloodsong stack with lichbane?
[2:26:23] kovptr: @aangles_ everyone said its bad and trolling, but he is pretty OP imo
[2:26:29] ThomasTheTwink: no they are both sheen items and dont work together
[2:26:31] MajinBuubs: me going to the sundered sky store to buy human papilloma viruses per auto CAPYBARA
[2:26:37] denunciator: 16 days is 3 weeks unless you're streaming twice a day
[2:26:59] denunciator: speaking of HPV why did the 4-valence vaccine get pulled? it's so bullshit
[2:27:05] denunciator: the 9-valence one costs so much

[2:28:34] bluegazer1: looks like 2nd e didnt dmg yet
[2:28:42] denunciator: I wonder why Diana is more viable than Darius though Darius has earlier cc and more damage
[2:28:47] denunciator: or is it team diff
[2:28:48] aangles_: @kovptr it is a troll pick. you provide nothing to the team. just because you got lucky 3 games in a row playing him support it does not mean its a viable pick to play as support. you provide nothing for the team. if its poke and damage you're looking for there are ample amounts of other viable champs that provide a lot more than smolder. to me you're just picking smolder for fun its not to climb with

[4:56:42] saintopiaa: elise > senna
[4:56:47] ejhavok: makes sense
[4:56:59] ejhavok: I don't think I've played her outside aram
[4:57:18] bladetrinity16: im not sure if she can go right over the new wall, but most of them she can

[5:16:10] voidmoons: it was fun :3
[5:16:13] whatgalaxies: jinx feralUWU
[5:16:22] pIasmate: I stopped playing before lethality was introduced. What ls lethality vs armour pen?
[5:16:24] TwitchTime89: @voidmoons that's good!!!
[5:16:24] Deku_Dreaming: @lory98x It's roughly 2s
[5:16:30] Deku_Dreaming: if we're being pedantic
[5:16:35] ejhavok: @pIasmate now, nothing. it used to be level scaling
[5:16:58] pIasmate: is lethality flat armour reduction?
[5:16:58] feerACTUAL: How do I gamble all of my channel points?
[5:17:05] ejhavok: now its just flat armor pen per lethality I believe
[5:17:10] TwitchTime89: you have to wait for a gamba
[5:17:36] voidmoons: mods here are very allergic to gambas
[5:17:43] TwitchTime89: LUL
[5:18:00] ThomasTheTwink: i did a gamba for this game earlier RAGEY
[5:18:03] feerACTUAL: @voidmoons  SadgeCry
[5:18:11] ejhavok: smolder looks SO fun. not at all good, but fun
[5:18:30] call_me_teaa: @ejhavok i played him yesterday, i think he's pretty good AND fun
[5:18:37] voidmoons: one gamba per stream is normal here
[5:18:38] lory98x: now everyone is running comet. he's a great poke champ now (at least in lane)
[5:18:39] Kaisa_Kardashian: and his mom works at riot so
[5:18:39] hihohu7: Swain is flying
[5:18:57] DudeBroMaximus: Didn't take Smolders long to start opening doran's ring. He does so much damage early lane
[5:18:57] call_me_teaa: @lory98x i tried this tech yesterday! it's very good
[5:19:04] call_me_teaa: the comet gave me first blood
[5:19:07] ejhavok: @ejhavok nice! I'm waiting on getting a shard of him bc I spent all my BE recently lol
[5:19:07] cdrs: #occupyjungle
[5:19:25] pIasmate: some smolders do no damage, some do crazy damage... it's a bit of a mix atm
[5:20:14] call_me_teaa: i mean, he does need to scale
[5:20:23] pIasmate: I'm talking before he scales
[5:20:25] ejhavok: at 225 stacks he def is a beast, but seems rare to hit without game going too sideways first
[5:20:29] pIasmate: around lvl 5-7
[5:20:29] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[5:20:38] bluegazer1: does crypto heal yourself too?
[5:20:50] call_me_teaa: @pIasmate i think it highly depends on matchup i'd say?
[5:20:53] DudeBroMaximus: crypto heals you while draining your wallet
[5:21:04] pIasmate: depends on runes and items
[5:21:11] lory98x: 225 is not that hard if you can farm
[5:21:21] lory98x: on supp is definitely harder
[5:21:25] ThomasTheTwink: just steal farm notveryowo
[5:21:38] AugustXP: in 60+ min 100% u can baseg
[5:21:48] denunciator: generates a stack of Dragon Practice each time he hits an enemy champion with an ability,
[5:21:49] pIasmate: some early/mid game smolders can clear a wave easily, some struggle
[5:21:55] DudeBroMaximus: Wardens and supps that need to execute minions aren't the best with Smolder cos he needs all the farm
[5:22:18] ThomasTheTwink: wtf
[5:22:18] denunciator: basically to get Smolder stacks you'd have to trade aggressively like with senna
[5:22:25] ThomasTheTwink: diana does more turret damage than adcs
[5:22:33] call_me_teaa: yeah diana is pretty more the rift herald KEKW
[5:22:36] DudeBroMaximus: what is that Diana damage

[5:23:27] feerACTUAL: wut?
[5:23:28] AugustXP: i remember that they made Ekko ap to make him not to take turrets, and after some years Riot made ap damage to turrets and even buffed it
[5:23:29] Suzakus: eve Afraid
[5:23:35] denunciator: evelynn Q absolutely destroys 2v2s
[5:23:36] ThomasTheTwink: Evelynda

[5:25:02] reformedJay: mute everyone GIGACHAD
[5:25:05] feerACTUAL: Always?
[5:25:05] ThomasTheTwink: e is a dash when u trigger ur passive
[5:25:10] denunciator: within a certain range or to W marked targets I tink
[5:25:32] kaiserwroth: What‚Äôs her passive in the first place Clueless
[5:25:40] Plahbie: E is like Elise Q
[5:25:42] avuloseunda: Evelynn doesn't need to build magic pen against me. If i see her my cloths are off
[5:25:42] call_me_teaa: @ImTheFlowerYoureTheBee it's not a dash per say? it just follows someone if they dash, not a dash on itself
[5:25:43] ejhavok: and its not a long dash at all
[5:25:43] ThomasTheTwink: so u have to disengage for like 4 seconds and then it refreshes e cd and it dashes
[5:25:44] avuloseunda: Flushed
[5:25:46] call_me_teaa: it's empowered
[5:25:52] Suzakus: @avuloseunda HUH
[5:25:55] kyraaleesong: Not the Ghost Cleanse Nunu
[5:25:56] denunciator: wait W doesn't empower evelynn E?

[5:26:03] avuloseunda: @suzakus stuntLUL
[5:26:04] Plahbie: yeah spider q
[5:26:04] PortugueseCook: Disco Nunu in the top lane
[5:26:10] call_me_teaa: no, going on stealth mode does it
[5:26:17] feerACTUAL: Oh, E is only dash when its empowered... I ddidn't even know that and I play it all the time lol
[5:26:24] Cyaxd: !opgg
[5:26:24] Nightbot: https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/167%20trick-000
[5:26:50] denunciator: wow okay I didn't know E only empowers with passive
[5:26:58] ejhavok: I think if you're good at eve an eve supp is so awful to play against. but generic/random eves playing supp rarely do much
[5:27:01] kufuhu: fiora into leo is so fun
[5:27:06] ThomasTheTwink: e cd resets when u go into passive too
[5:27:06] itsjos3ph: gp sounds so entertaining
[5:27:15] ThomasTheTwink: or used too hehe
[5:27:17] call_me_teaa: the empowered E just basically latches onto someone if they try to run away, let's say you have empowered E and use it on ezreal and he tries to run away. he can't oop
[5:27:23] denunciator: I guess  I didn't realize because I always wait for W proc so I thought W makes it proc LUL
[5:27:24] iStalkCheese: whenever u invis your e resets cd and becomes empowered
[5:27:27] jangel143: so many words have been said but no clear explanation yet LUL
[5:27:49] denunciator: W already shreds magic res
[5:28:00] denunciator: oh you mean gp
[5:28:00] bluegazer1: lichbane zakzak
[5:28:10] itsjos3ph: zed will be fun
[5:28:14] b3anzgg: what letter are you on?
[5:28:19] feerACTUAL: @jangel143 the icon changes you can tell when its empowered
[5:28:24] denunciator: isn't gp just Fleet, so you prep a barrel and get double passive on them
[5:28:44] call_me_teaa: yeah the icon gets this pinkish glow around it, and it's lighter
[5:28:45] denunciator: or you could go grasp and spam Q like mf "support"
[5:29:05] call_me_teaa: electrocute is the best rune on eve, her 3 Q's alone can proc it
[5:29:05] haymayyn: he playing each champ until he wins with it?
[5:29:13] Atanaxe: this whole match is e champs
[5:29:21] Atanaxe: evelynn elise ezreal ekko

[5:29:47] captain_manstone: what do you think of poke smolder sup @stunt ? I pretty like it but max to dia 4
[5:30:00] Thommenius: Man people do think you're stealing their jungle, huh?
[5:30:03] ThomasTheTwink: ekko was surprisingly good!
[5:30:17] denunciator: didn't spankers or someone get brutalized by eve lvl 2 a couple days ago

[8:53:28] Balldropper: my garen support always loses to maokai
[8:53:37] jinky___: @ana_lfabeta nope
[8:53:56] Thommenius: Trailblazer goes quite nice imo
[8:53:56] Mahuz: smolder is fuming
[8:54:05] ChromaKhroma: smolder probably says that every game
[8:54:08] ChromaKhroma: and thinks its funny
[8:54:49] ana_lfabeta: i havent seen a smolder in aram once
[8:54:53] jinky___: @Balldropper anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great
[8:55:31] Thommenius: I like dancing boots with trailblazer setting up quick and easy roams, especially with ult, even top is easy access
[8:55:48] savvy_with_it: @jinky___ it is not to be without fear, but with courage
[8:55:50] GhostOfMe435: stunt what do you think of thresh rn as support\

[8:56:19] GhostOfMe435: whose ure go to support on a serious game?
[8:57:19] Mahuz: Emerald 3 i think the rank is
[8:57:26] Balldropper: @jinky___ I thought I could control the brush and just spin to win when the ad comes close but maokai just throwss a sappling in and im all sad
[8:57:39] Augment93: wait really? this is em3? wtf am I watching lmao
[8:57:47] icehat_702: maybe hexflash out of the bush then spin to win? @Balldropper
[8:57:56] Balldropper: o shoot that would be next level
[8:58:10] icehat_702: i wanted that from ksante support but havent gotten it to work yet :(
[8:58:19] Mahuz: emerald is the divas of plat
[8:58:26] icehat_702: bc ksante has unstoppable :3
[8:58:32] Balldropper: icehat, have u been running any maokai support?
[8:58:36] Balldropper: or just playing supports u find fun
[8:58:52] icehat_702: i never play thingns that are good, not in magic, not in league, i only play things that are fun
[8:59:02] Balldropper: so u on that HWEI support?
[8:59:06] icehat_702: u know it
[8:59:09] Balldropper: <3 nice
[8:59:23] icehat_702: my secret tech is quinn support with trailblazer but my team never follows my trail
[8:59:26] Balldropper: smolder getting dove damn
[8:59:44] Elyson04: Wait camille support into tanks or ranged?
[8:59:47] Balldropper: did smolder call MOMMMMMMM
[9:00:00] Balldropper: that fizz XD
[9:00:12] mzwatup: that bounty gold
[9:01:08] Balldropper: I suck vs really mobile supports tho like bard and pyke and twitch
[9:01:48] Balldropper: I prefer when they are tanky/enchanter supports
[9:02:23] icehat_702: every game i play enemy bot lane is longest range possible i hate it
[9:02:40] Balldropper: I have faced a few xerath supports
[9:02:51] adzz____: i like playing adc but i dont think i have the style to play one, like i enjoy trying to farm up and taking fights i know i can win but feels like my sup wants to fight all the time
[9:02:59] icehat_702: ez xerath, cait lux, etc
[9:03:26] Thommenius: @adzz____ Your supports might know how and when to engage to win a fight and so win the lane
[9:03:27] Balldropper: i dont mind hwei into lux most of the time
[9:03:46] zadnap: How is playing with smolder?
[9:03:56] Balldropper: not every1 can hit bindings like stunt can <3
[9:03:57] sumthingsup: yuge
[9:04:04] icehat_702: have you tried glacial hwei? balldropper?
[9:04:18] kallista27: dude fizz is EVERYWHERE
[9:04:35] Balldropper: I've tried it but I feel like that puts hwei into an even more awkward spot
[9:04:46] Balldropper: because hwei generally doesn't outdamage a pure damage support like brand or zyra
[9:05:02] zadnap: Feel like he will be bad in low elo if it depends on stacks lol
[9:05:05] Balldropper: he is like a bit of everything and glacial makes him even moreso that
[9:05:06] icehat_702: i just think his cc is so light, also the damage reduction for team fights is really good with EE
[9:05:22] Balldropper: I think I'd only go that against a 4 melee enemy team
[9:05:23] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[9:05:28] icehat_702: fair
[9:05:33] Balldropper: against a logn ranged team the glacial will mean next to nothing
[9:05:39] Balldropper: because they will be outpoking your team
[9:05:52] zadnap: I feel support Hwei is more of a carry than utility
[9:06:07] Thommenius: What did you think of locking new champs out of ranked for a week
[9:06:45] Balldropper: been mainly running meteor first strike or sometimes dark harvest if I know a lot of fights will be happening based on the comp
[9:07:27] kaiserwroth: hwei is utility only in gm / challenger lobbies where your carries actually know how to carry
[9:07:39] moonglow_1: !az

[9:45:01] denunciator: the big slow one
[9:45:39] KayXOTV: hover support hahaha
[9:45:45] Kishatu: do you think streams motivate people to become stalkers? Im talking about IRL streams... people just watch other people life and how normal it becomes to just watch and not interact you know? @stunt
[9:46:08] ash_chiming: um‚Ä¶.
[9:46:09] Kishatu: idk just a thought in my head
[9:46:37] KayXOTV: gp adc :D
[9:46:42] redtauro: @Kishatu that would be like watching a movie where people kill each other and not know the difference in real life
[9:46:58] denunciator: GP is so fun
[9:46:59] Cenedess_: ohh he thought u meant what supp they play
[9:47:01] redtauro: human brain has enough ability to differentiate and not do certain things depending on the context
[9:47:02] ash_chiming: the fault is the stalker not the streamer
[9:47:16] KayXOTV: oh he thought you prefered a certain support
[9:47:21] ash_chiming: idk it sounds like the ‚Äúasking for it‚Äù argument which was very ick
[9:47:33] The_Epiko: whhhat?
[9:47:40] redtauro: @ash_chiming yep...
[9:47:56] denunciator: oh my god this comp is atrocious

[9:48:06] KayXOTV: 0 frontline yep
[9:48:10] alpacapple: oh this is wild
[9:48:11] Kishatu: @redtauro naah a movie is acted but if you have no friends and no social life and you just watch streams all day... idk
[9:48:15] frayfan_: Clueless itll be fine
[9:48:21] denunciator: is AP jhin time
[9:48:22] Balldropper: chat, can you remind stunt that he is awesome <3
[9:48:27] ash_chiming: @kishatu is everything okay?
[9:48:30] denunciator: !awesome
[9:48:39] ash_chiming: no jokes, just hope you‚Äôre doing alright
[9:48:50] redtauro: @Kishatu yea but you know that person is not your friend and they are letting you watch them by 'streaming' voluntarily. So the context matters.
[9:48:59] denunciator: omg is me
[9:49:06] bluegazer1: think again :]
[9:49:14] kaotikaznkid: I‚Äôm so doomed. instead of sleeping for worked, I stayed up and watched 10 hours of your stream.
[9:49:21] denunciator: wh
[9:49:36] Kishatu: @ash_chiming yes im fine, just trying to have a interesting conversation lmao
[9:49:42] KayXOTV: i lost my job because of stunts long streams
[9:49:53] KayXOTV: Kappa
[9:49:58] Kishatu: @redtauro yeah maybe... idk
[9:49:58] denunciator: I hope I don't lose my job
[9:50:01] kaotikaznkid: thank god I work fr home üòÇ
[9:50:13] adzz____: i watch stunt stream while i do my job
[9:50:14] call_me_teaa: I don't think they were trying to put the blame on the streamer, I think they meant "what if IRL streams have more potential stalkers?" because there is a location and there are weird people out there that develop very weird parasocial relationships. Which to be fair I think it has happened before, I wouldn't say it "motivates" people, but rather can put streamers in a more vulnerable position and should be more careful
[9:50:21] call_me_teaa: this is my take on what they said i guess x)
[9:50:24] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
