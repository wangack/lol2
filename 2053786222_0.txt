[0:27:32] KrakOune: ITS SUNDERED SKY
[0:27:36] Varelico: Even typical sunderer champs dont build it anymore. Interested to see if its as good as you say

[6:15:54] StreamElements: Cowsep moved to Korea in September 2012 originally to become a game developer. He secured a job as a teacher fresh out of university to get his foot on the ground, failed to get any jobs as a game developer, and transitioned into a full time streamer and stayed there because he likes how the cities are set up, and how comfortable and easy it is to live there. Hes been streaming since 2014 full time.
