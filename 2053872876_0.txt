[0:51:09] kalibula123: also can someone explain me, why overweight Udyr can run faster than in shape sett, huh ?
[0:51:11] fares910: push up gap
[0:51:19] fares910: cause sett has too much muscle
[0:51:22] fares910: it weighs him down
[0:51:30] settorugojo: Udyr isnt fat Just muscles
[0:51:33] fares910: his arm is bigger than udyrs dad belly
[0:51:38] TineLettMelk: @kalibula123 cause a bear can run 60 km/h

[0:53:28] TineLettMelk: or just use ur fists
[0:53:30] fares910: true I’ve seen skinny yasuo 1v1 bear
[0:53:38] fares910: I can definitely beat him
[0:53:45] TiodoPave_1: @autolykuslol US doesn't have a name for the pie I'm cookin
[0:53:46] fares910: what if I fist him in his eyes
[0:53:48] TiodoPave_1: damn

[0:59:05] settorugojo: Is Darius or Morde a better blindpick
[0:59:54] TineLettMelk: @settorugojo probably depends on the rest of you team, and what they have picked so far
[1:00:07] zaid_2030: hello
[1:00:30] zaid_2030: @kalibula123 old divine udyr melt morde xdd
[1:00:33] Lansstuss: @AutolykusLoL random wild question, what're your thoughts on Sett support? It's a pick I tend to lean towards when enemy team is tank / engage heavy.
[1:00:34] Ruki_GazettE: i smell a zac int incoming
[1:01:05] kalibula123: what do you usually ban ?

[1:03:03] kingadp123: Raid boss activated
[1:03:20] kingadp123: UNLUCKY
[1:03:24] soplicamurzynska: RIOT
[1:03:30] TineLettMelk: stupid painter champ
[1:04:51] zaid_2030: this game on you , you must carry
[1:05:02] TineLettMelk: really weird.. i feel like if its mordekaisers "Realm" it shouldnt be a "realm" on the map
[1:06:16] Lansstuss: that'd brick the game too much and ppl would cry that his R has no counterplay
[1:06:42] TineLettMelk: @Lansstuss doesnt Qss or cleanse work on the ult ?
[1:07:06] Lansstuss: besides, realm of death in Lore is parallel to actual living world
[1:07:08] Lansstuss: afaik
[1:07:26] zaid_2030: @TineLettMelk qss or olaf ult or gp w remove morde ult
[1:07:35] Lansstuss: ye I know
[1:07:40] Lansstuss: but tell that to crybabies in adc role

[1:07:47] Lansstuss: that never wanna buy qss
[1:08:02] blangish: And Sion R if Morde fucked up with casting time
[1:08:34] TineLettMelk: does fizz E work that way to ? or is mordes ult just refreshed
[1:08:46] blangish: Refreshed
[1:08:51] TineLettMelk: okey
[1:12:05] TineLettMelk: the panth be inting ? O.o

[1:14:40] Ruki_GazettE: i like how we didn't even see the inside of the realm before she died lol
[1:15:48] TineLettMelk: like 4 real, what is the best sett skin and what is the worst? i feel ike most of them are not that amazing ..

[1:17:00] blangish: Sett is a badass champ, but most his skins feel quirky and goofy
[1:18:04] aura_28: get riftmaker
[1:19:28] Lordekaiser23: @tinelettmelk the best is obsidian dragon and the worst is spirit blossom
[1:19:41] Nightbot: Check out and upvote if you like to the top! https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/12-5-autolykuss-challenger-sett-guide-594869
[1:20:19] blangish: Spirit blossom feels good, no?
[1:20:29] TineLettMelk: @SettToVictory actually ? i thought SB was the better skin :o wich of the obsidian skins ? the prestige or the original
[1:20:38] stoemae: @aura_28 Riftmaker is good for 1v1 but not for 5v5
[1:20:39] blangish: OBJECTION
[1:21:00] TineLettMelk: i also feel like mecha kingdoms is really weird cause of the sounds.l. and it also feels somewhat clunky
[1:22:38] hrh_capitano: Isn't Force of nature better against Hwei?
[1:23:45] Lansstuss: nah
[1:23:57] Lansstuss: visage is better on morde imo coz of buff to W
[1:24:06] Lordekaiser23: @tinelettmelk the original
[1:24:32] Lordekaiser23: @blangish for a legendary skin it feels kind of a letdown
[1:24:44] TineLettMelk: @SettToVictory okey
[1:24:50] Citrussyyy: Good afternoon auto
[1:25:29] Lansstuss: KEKW Varus
[1:25:45] TineLettMelk: @AutolykusLoL self-mitigated damage, if a support shields you, does that count towards your "self-mitigated" damage or does it not
[1:27:42] Lansstuss: May I ask why mercs? Wouldn't Tabi be better vs their comp?
[1:27:45] Citrussyyy: What's the cooldown on quicksilver
[1:28:06] Citrussyyy: NotLikeThis
[1:28:16] Lansstuss: 1:30 me thinks
[1:29:29] hrh_capitano: Zac got the yi syndrome
[1:30:09] Lansstuss: Zac feels like an autofill tbh
[1:30:34] TineLettMelk: u did good @AutolykusLoL !
[1:31:15] Tempsly: Whats that alarm
[1:31:20] Lansstuss: it's Disturbed

[1:31:25] Lansstuss: Warrior
[1:31:31] Tempsly: Ohh lmao
[1:31:47] Tempsly: We have exactly that alarm here every first monday of the month 12 o clock
[1:31:50] Lansstuss: @AutolykusLoL generic, fav sett skin question
[1:31:55] Tempsly: Which was about an hour ago
[1:32:10] TiodoPave_1: !skins
[1:32:10] Nightbot: Obsidian Dragon → Soul Fighter → Spirit Blossom → Base Skin → Heartsteel → Firecracker → Pool Party → Prestige Obsidian Dragon → Mecha Kingdoms
[1:32:14] TiodoPave_1: me back
[1:32:23] TiodoPave_1: internet guy came here again
[1:32:31] Lansstuss: Really
[1:32:35] TiodoPave_1: stayed for like, 40 mins
[1:32:38] Lansstuss: is prestige that low on the list
[1:32:52] TiodoPave_1: @autolykuslol THAT'S THE PROBLEM
[1:32:56] Tempsly: I do like Obsidian best too
[1:32:58] TiodoPave_1: IT GOT FIXED YESTERDAY
[1:33:04] TiodoPave_1: NotLikeThis
[1:33:06] Lansstuss: any particular reason? I prefer base Obsidian myself but just curious
[1:33:14] Lansstuss: like the color scheme better tbh
[1:33:46] Tempsly: The prestige takes away everything that skin represents; darkness, fire, magma, etc.
[1:34:01] Tempsly: Thats why I dont like the prestige either.
[1:34:09] Lansstuss: I odn't have prestige
[1:34:18] Lansstuss: will probably get it when it's back in rotation just for sake of having it
[1:34:27] Lansstuss: I detest Heartsteel tho
[1:34:52] Lansstuss: all that boyband e-boy theme does NOT fit with Sett's character imo
[1:35:02] TineLettMelk: @Lansstuss agree
[1:35:12] Tempsly: He's still the cool guy even in the music video tho Lanss
[1:35:22] TiodoPave_1: its age
[1:35:27] Tempsly: I needed some getting used to too
[1:35:39] TineLettMelk: they should have just given sett a pure out MMA skin LUL
[1:35:41] Tempsly: But now I think Heartsteel is cool and the song slaps
[1:36:41] Tempsly: What would be the one best tip that will skyrocket someones Sett gameplay?
[1:37:18] Tempsly: I mean he's not wrong 😅
[1:37:32] TineLettMelk: practice makes perfect
[1:38:12] Tempsly: Tune
[1:38:15] Lansstuss: I'd say learn to use your W smart
[1:38:26] Lansstuss: the amount of sett players I saw use it with no grit
[1:38:29] Lansstuss: makes me wanan puke

[6:30:32] msluciphine: @RiptidexRiltreks Shit, Nexus Blitz was hella fun. I love both modes so much. I wish they were permanent ;w;
[6:30:35] 葉の小さい: i spammed that the whole time it was out last year. that’s all i played

[6:32:42] jmoney1890: yea that’s the right amount xD
[6:33:26] TheSaltyShakerLoL: NotLikeThis
[6:33:31] RiptidexRiltreks: @msluciphine too bad the dummies at the numbers department think when a gamemode stabilizes that means its dead and not interacted with.
[6:34:05] RiptidexRiltreks: imagine if call of duty had only 2 game modes then forced everyone else who liked other stuff to wait for rotations
[6:34:09] RiptidexRiltreks: how fast that game would die
[6:35:44] msluciphine: Whoever thinks that in their headquarters.... I hope they got laid off and someone pitches perma game modes :^)
[6:35:55] msluciphine: OTL
[6:36:21] 葉の小さい: wish NB stayed
[6:36:23] TheSaltyShakerLoL: too many hackers in shootinga games

[6:43:12] RiptidexRiltreks: also, no matter how much people try to gaslight me, wintrading also 100% exists in low elo. it ABSOLUTELY is not the cause for every game. I'm not delusional, but some games are just so blatant. fresh bought acc vs-ing enchanter accs offroling mid or jg? come on man. thats literally the classic setup
[6:43:29] TheSaltyShakerLoL: assassins creed main character entered the game
[6:43:33] RiptidexRiltreks: i will not be convinced otherwise
[6:43:54] RiptidexRiltreks: i am 99% the cause for most of my losses
[6:44:30] RiptidexRiltreks: yet the freshie vs offrolling enchanter accounts just always performs bad
