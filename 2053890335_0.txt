[0:22:08] Skrunken: not having to deal with trolling supports is also a plus vicksySip
[0:22:19] champrath: issue with smolder adc is that if you go in auto range every adc trades better than you this is not true for mid
[0:23:23] 9fierce9: This Brand is a coward, how does he not go in on a 3rd health Sylas?
[0:23:51] Gigagenius: The dude walks into a bush and brand thinks he disappeared

[0:37:56] champrath: Nidalee has the Smolder Curve KEKW She is strong OTP till highest elos it feels like
[0:38:00] champrath: then she loses every game there
[0:38:14] otiswilbur: nida feels so slow
[0:38:15] otiswilbur: no?
[0:38:31] champrath: Even if you are if people are decent and know how to play against her she just loses it feels like this season
[0:38:47] champrath: Nidalee OTP's struggle it feels like this season specificly
[0:39:05] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[0:39:11] 9fierce9: runes and summs DinkDonk
[0:39:25] champrath: get ready your W-Q KEKW
[0:39:47] otiswilbur: flash on d D:
[0:39:54] champrath: Yea she will try to freeze and fish engages with E
[0:39:55] otiswilbur: what
[0:39:56] GandorTheGreat: @champrath even OTP's? Like I knew the champ is hard for ppl that didn't master her. But she for a longest time was fine in high elo
[0:40:05] otiswilbur: how have i been watching this monster so long without noticing D:
[0:40:22] champrath: @champrath Thats what she felt like for a bit but this season i havent seen a nid do well
[0:41:00] champrath: its probably because they normalized clear times
[0:41:16] otiswilbur: rainy weather is nice
[0:41:20] otiswilbur: except during winter
[0:41:21] ragecleaner: i miss rain
[0:41:24] otiswilbur: frick rainy winter
[0:41:26] ragecleaner: it's only snowing here
[0:41:31] mitchie_2484: oh hello, good morning 5upWave
[0:41:41] otiswilbur: ngl
[0:41:42] otiswilbur: where im from
[0:41:46] otiswilbur: it rains a decent amount
[0:41:59] otiswilbur: but when it rains during winter, you have to put a helmet on to walk
[0:42:13] renziboss: @otiswilbur lol
[0:42:32] champrath: somebody or multiple people tried to dodge KEKW
[0:42:44] ragecleaner: @otiswilbur it's not even raining here and that's the weather 24/7, i could skate when walking my dogs Sadge
[0:42:46] champrath: it was stuck at %80 now %90
[0:43:07] balletbunny: !rank
[0:43:07] Fossabot: 5up is currently Master I 18 LP. Use !ranks for other games.

[0:43:13] champrath: Elise Nid snowball or bust game
[0:43:16] otiswilbur: my 3kg dog literally pulls me everywhere
[0:43:20] otiswilbur: and im just skating along KEKW
[0:43:28] GandorTheGreat: @champrath hmm. Makes sense. She was super obnoxious with her invading and stuff, but u absolutely had to know how + hit your Q's. But I didn't realize she got much worse this season
[0:44:13] GandorTheGreat: 90% into game. Well. High chance for remake Sadge
[0:44:14] champrath: @champrath I think its mostly cause of pet changes and new terrain changes biggest thing nid had for her was her unpredictiable pathing but walls are a bit thicker now and people have to learn pounce spots again to avoid vision
[0:44:36] GandorTheGreat: @champrath this makes a lot of sense
[0:45:14] GandorTheGreat: I love it how every streamer has old map overlay :D
[0:45:39] champrath: Yep they aint connecting back KEKW
[0:45:46] champrath: they dodged and never opener league again KEKW

[0:53:50] champrath: Bard has been broken so long and its 2x this season im surprised they left alone him this long
[0:55:04] champrath: yep
[0:55:08] champrath: He is a issue though
[0:55:13] ewwii_damncat: mini map looks kinda messed up
[0:55:18] champrath: he has been op last season as well
[0:55:27] champrath: you wont see anything more than Bard at higher elo lobbies
[0:55:31] champrath: same with SEnna
[0:55:33] champrath: but she needs comp
[0:55:36] mlemfloofs: @ewwii_damncat D: apologize to the mini map majj
[0:56:05] ewwii_damncat: 5upLUL
[0:56:41] GandorTheGreat: 52.7% WR at 11% popularity in master+. Damn that champ is strong rn
[0:57:05] GandorTheGreat: not smolder. Bard
[0:57:36] GandorTheGreat: 29.3% wr master+ smolder OMEGALUL
[0:59:02] GandorTheGreat: ez. U facecheck Trundle. Other than that? U need to be bad :D
[1:04:18] GandorTheGreat: It felt like the champ wasn't the strongest. But I never realized he is SO DAMN BAD. Well. That's difference between my lowly emerald vs master+
[1:04:34] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[1:05:08] SyntheeR: Get smolder'd
[1:05:17] SyntheeR: also hi 5upWave
[1:06:06] GandorTheGreat: no he isn't
[1:06:51] GandorTheGreat: He's not weak like say lillia, but he's def weaker then xin early
[1:07:00] vsmilotic: your JG lost smite fli[p level 1? i dont know maybe
[1:08:56] vsmilotic: no idea then watch replay later LUL
[1:10:13] GandorTheGreat: ye it looks doomed. But then again - I had games like this that suddenly turned (very rare tho)
[1:11:02] GandorTheGreat: I want to see 1st jg fight pls :)
[1:11:02] wriju07: how is the smolder mid going?
[1:11:32] GandorTheGreat: omg
[1:11:40] Th0rnAp1: he used spells on crab
[1:12:15] vsmilotic: hmm i see
[1:12:28] GandorTheGreat: ye. he went all in for crab and didn't pay attention to viego one bit. Total disrespect
[1:13:02] vDaishar: LUL
[1:13:41] vsmilotic: LUL
[1:14:04] wriju07: so is smolder mid really OP?
[1:14:10] Lunoria: I don't think that Zyra ult was THAT bad. I think she assumed you'd run to her in river, essentially zoning them with the delayed knock-up.. but you went up and the ult ends up like an int
[1:14:12] vsmilotic: NA KEKW
[1:14:24] vDaishar: Dies a bunch? Better finish my Triforce asap!
[1:15:07] GandorTheGreat: @wriju07 I checked stats. According to league of graphs, master+ smolder has 29.3% wr (overall, all roles and regions). IDK if there's a position where he can be OK
[1:15:20] VioletDisorder: it's an impressive one to miss
[1:15:38] GandorTheGreat: 0.4%
[1:16:22] vsmilotic: ezreal is most play?? LUL really
[1:16:26] GandorTheGreat: if u give me exception, I can post link
[1:16:54] GandorTheGreat: hmm interesting
[1:17:01] VioletDisorder: I'm so happy karma is back
[1:17:03] vsmilotic: let me guess people wanna play him but if they dont get him they pick ezreal
[1:17:41] GandorTheGreat: It's just weird that leagueofgraphs give so damn different stats
[1:18:01] vsmilotic: is that vayne mid LUL
[1:19:02] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[1:19:11] GandorTheGreat: maybe leagueofgraphs provide stats from longer time period (meaning more from time he wasn't in game yet)
[1:19:18] wriju07: oof an yasuo
[1:19:44] cokopuffz: that looks not fun till 225
[1:19:56] jeskieKAT: jeskieKAT subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! 38 5upBongo
[1:21:26] jeskieKAT: CatDance
[1:21:26] cari141: Jessi 5upWave
[1:21:33] jeskieKAT: Cari 5upL
[1:21:43] GandorTheGreat: 0.6% popularity, 0.3% ban rate, 15.8% wr (specific to NA in ranked master+ smolder). That actually doesn't sound right. That page really has to be wrong in something when I realize how those numbers work
[1:22:17] minismile_: oh youre live i didnt get notif
[1:22:23] minismile_: im outside touching grass so muted

[1:22:42] jeskieKAT: Mini ModLove
[1:22:45] cari141: I got a notif
[1:22:50] SorayaSayo: I got one too
[1:23:00] wriju07: twitch notif is broken
[1:23:03] mercurial1o1: Twitch be wack
[1:23:06] GandorTheGreat: @minismile_ swehytHi
[1:23:11] minismile_: hi
[1:23:15] minismile_: how r u guys
[1:23:39] wriju07: doing good
[1:24:01] balletbunny: pikaHi
[1:25:03] balletbunny: monkaS
[1:25:30] GandorTheGreat: These song are TOO MAINSTREAM for you. Kinda surprised to hear them on your stream :D
[1:25:38] SyntheeR: Is Blitzcrank actually that bad?
[1:25:51] cokopuffz: somebody don't deserve the grammy
[1:26:14] balletbunny: baby dragon peepoHappy
[1:27:56] wriju07: ooh yone mid
[1:28:17] juanelemichele: She carrying
[1:28:17] champrath: tbh ignite is just stronger early
[1:28:21] vsmilotic: wow very aggresive i see
[1:28:21] champrath: even used defensively
[1:28:24] Reeekku: its for the rammus duhhh
[1:28:30] vebo_0: clearly they have their plans
[1:28:45] champrath: tbh its heal barrier angle
[1:28:47] champrath: for these
[1:28:52] champrath: you make cleanse obselete
[1:29:05] champrath: literally -1 sum spell with cleanse
[1:29:09] champrath: its for your exhaust
[1:29:15] champrath: or ignite
[1:29:26] Reeekku: cleansing the janna ignite
[1:29:45] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[1:29:49] champrath: aggro lanes against scaling adcs usually pick cleanse if they champ allows
[1:29:56] champrath: so outplay is heal barrier KEKW
[1:31:14] champrath: janna does not know rule n1 for a rell lane: play around flash engage lvl 1
[1:31:35] ericarosaleen: !title
[1:31:35] Fossabot: @ericarosaleen Title for 5up: Master player shows you why smolder mid is op while team mates complain.
[1:31:38] vDaishar: Actually gave you the kill too
[1:31:39] SyntheeR: What is the name of enemy's support (that horse champ)?
[1:31:45] vDaishar: pogg
[1:31:53] Lunoria: @SyntheeR Rell
[1:31:59] champrath: @SyntheeR Rell she is a metal bender her horse is just her bending metal
[1:32:03] SyntheeR: greatl10EmmaLove
[1:32:10] SyntheeR: Thanks chat, you the best
[1:32:30] cokopuffz: "who are we killing"
[1:32:56] Halofan642: funny champion man
[1:33:52] Halofan642: ya on first day i thought it was on the strong side
[1:34:13] Halofan642: at least in soloq. smolders weaknesses seem to be "kill it early and dont let the game go to 25 minutes" which doesnt happen in soloq
[1:34:55] Halofan642: 10 stcaks a min seems to be the breakpoint in my games, at least at 20 mins
[1:34:58] Halofan642: aka 200ish stacks at 20 mins
[1:34:58] champrath: His W is kinda broken
[1:35:34] vDaishar: The 3 points in W is perfect
[1:36:34] Halofan642: oh my god
[1:37:03] SyntheeR: That lee sin seems to be mvp
[1:37:05] vDaishar: The body blockage
[1:37:06] vsmilotic: POG
[1:37:58] champrath: if they want to buff one thing i think they should remove his cast times during his E
[1:38:09] champrath: so you can q w during it without slowing down
[1:38:14] champrath: might be too good tho
[1:38:51] Halofan642: i think maybe we shouldntbuff this champion
[1:38:55] Halofan642: just my humble opinion as a noob
[1:39:19] cokopuffz: let him auto with r
[1:39:22] cokopuffz: e*
[1:39:33] cokopuffz: maybe pta would work then
[1:40:29] cokopuffz: meant to say e
[1:40:41] Itsundiscovered: what is this tech?
[1:40:57] BenoitRanque: After many hours on this game I still don't get how people have fun with it
[1:40:58] SyntheeR: That lee sin is such a W
[1:41:29] vDaishar: Rolled
[1:41:42] Halofan642: certainly they ff 15 right
[1:42:08] sleepyviic: hello!
[1:42:11] sleepyviic: how are the games going
[1:42:24] BenoitRanque: last night players from both teams agreed to report me in chat, for playing badly. Tried to keep playing but kept dying basically instantly.  So now I'm suspended
[1:42:42] BenoitRanque: But hey I guess you folks enjoy the game?
[1:42:56] sleepyviic: still master?
[1:43:20] cari141: !rank
[1:43:21] Fossabot: 5up is currently Master I 0 LP. Use !ranks for other games.

[2:07:38] mercurial1o1: Top laners r special creatures
[2:08:38] vDaishar: This is a team canyon
[2:08:41] reveriedream: Maybe this is why Smolder's w/r is so low

[2:11:54] Fossabot: 5up is currently Master I 19 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[2:13:55] cokopuffz: these look like draft reg qs
[2:14:12] olavi14: Bro why are they malding so much
[2:14:28] cokopuffz: is that jg even good
[2:14:46] cokopuffz: do you think na mental has gotten worse with time or has it always been this bad
[2:14:48] reveriedream: Lol no items
[2:15:32] blazin_barbie: Is this suppose to be Rihanna radio
[2:16:12] GandorTheGreat: D2 gnar 2/9/2. Insane
[2:16:24] jonathon_irl: yeah like the game was always toxic but giving up 30 seconds into the game didn't used to be anywhere near as bad
[2:16:34] cokopuffz: do you think esports is gonna die in na then
[2:16:36] vDaishar: All he knows how to do is fight
[2:16:47] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: That game was nearly free if gnar and elise just calmed the fuck down.
[2:17:03] cokopuffz: is elise even a good jg rn
[2:17:14] chloeiwi: they're alright at rocket league
[2:17:22] domenest: NA won valo champs last year
[2:17:26] smok3dyy: cod is carrying
[2:17:30] chloeiwi: i mean it's still alive
[2:18:07] cokopuffz: just an interesting thought cause for instance valorant is huge but is killing its tier 2/3 scene
[2:19:02] TheNFLOnFox: swordart had that 6 million dollar contract with TSM just to play only one year
[2:19:02] dbdfbefbef: are you planning on mainly streaming league from now on? (as like main day to day stream)
[2:19:06] quasarptolemy: but are they really having fun when they're so whiny
[2:19:19] cokopuffz: the hyper inflated contracts seem to have toned down in na a bit
[2:19:24] dbdfbefbef: v fair!
[2:19:26] vsmilotic: u can have fun in league? Kappa
[2:19:46] cokopuffz: if you are in the franchise it's worth but getting into it is nigh impossible
[2:19:56] jeinsnow: Does 5up know people made him in character ai?
[2:20:04] vsmilotic: yes we love laughing at streamer
[2:20:11] Skrunken: is there any genre you absolutely will not touch?
[2:20:14] witchyasgod: I like that you play whatever you're currently into, you are a true variety streamer
[2:20:26] olavi14: Damn
[2:20:31] PoteetLee: No marbles on stream :(
[2:20:32] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I personally thrive on bashing your teammates when you play league.
[2:20:35] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[2:20:39] Lunoria: Mario kart fans in shambles
[2:20:41] cokopuffz: na franchise is also cooked cause it's na/ brazil so brazil takes half the spots
[2:21:08] gaulzen: for valo yea
[2:21:27] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Which is the dumbest fucking thing. It's free advertising.
[2:21:34] cokopuffz: they should have had brazil as its own league
[2:21:35] jonathon_irl: nintendo's been stricter on that with smash too
[2:21:43] cokopuffz: so more players and teams could participate both
[2:21:43] witchyasgod: yeah that makes no sense
[2:21:45] gaulzen: riot esports is probs doomed as well, cause their streaming platform is cancelled now
[2:21:57] Skrunken: yeah whats up with that?
[2:22:08] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Like DOTA lives off of secondary tourneys. Don't get me wrong I'm sure you need permission, but it is obviously not hard to get.
[2:22:15] cokopuffz: or like they made poor franchising team choices. eg won champs put their roster through contract hell. now only 1 previous member is on the team
[2:22:28] cokopuffz: yet for the up coming tournament eg holds the spot so they got a bi lmao
[2:22:30] JustaStoopidDog: uhhhh
[2:22:40] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Getting permission for a LoL tournament is either prohibitively expensive or just really hard to get them to do.
[2:22:42] gaulzen: @Skrunken that was what riot's whole plan for profitability in esports was, and now it's cancelled lmao
[2:22:44] Halofan642: i hope this game goes through
[2:22:47] Halofan642: so i can see jungles ign
[2:22:47] zatyna_: triple adc PogU
[2:23:00] blazin_barbie: what‚Äôs dota? I‚Äôm dumb
[2:23:10] olavi14: "useless late game" ok dude
[2:23:13] Damon3669: ppl when they dont know how the new champ works
[2:23:18] Skrunken: @gaulzen so its like when Bethesda tried to monetize mods?
[2:23:27] TheNFLOnFox: have you tried comet for early game
[2:23:35] TheNFLOnFox: been playing it and finding some success
[2:23:42] cokopuffz: 5up we all know you want the skin
[2:23:47] gaulzen: @Skrunken hmm, i dont know much about that so maybe
[2:23:48] TheNFLOnFox: oh LMAO
[2:23:55] jonathon_irl: @blazin_barbie dota was a moba that started as a mod for warcraft 3, and it's the game that inspired League of Legends. Eventually Valve made dota into a standalone game, Dota 2
[2:23:57] Lunoria: Honeslty, it's no different from EUW
[2:24:04] PoteetLee: !subgoal
[2:24:04] olavi14: Oh boy
[2:24:04] Fossabot: If we get to 1200 subs on his main we'll have a day of chat-chosen champs in league...on a smurf.
[2:24:05] cokopuffz: i was trying to rank up in val but i gave up. nobody cares or just hard throws
[2:24:09] gaulzen: @
[2:24:10] ladjanin: you don't report that kindred for holding hostage?
[2:24:15] vsmilotic: NA KEKW
[2:24:15] PoteetLee: Should I add mafia to that?
[2:24:19] cokopuffz: like why am i queuing and getting multiple games where people just leave round 5 lol
[2:24:21] Skrunken: @gaulzen basicly they tried to monetize mods for Skyrim, lets just say it didnt work out
[2:24:32] gaulzen: @Skrunken lmfao rip
[2:24:48] cokopuffz: 5up i think it's time to switch to smite 2
[2:24:50] CoJefe: It may be time to start up  league again, only "quit" twice
[2:24:54] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Time to move 5UP to.. normally i would joke about Korea, but they are shutting down twitch there... so China? Move 5UP to the superserver./
[2:25:04] Damon3669: yeah in euw as well used to be every other game someone afk
[2:25:18] JustaStoopidDog: the lion king soundtrack
[2:25:29] PoteetLee: !editcom !subgoal 1200: Chat chooses champs || 1500: Mafia with chat
[2:25:29] Fossabot: @PoteetLee Successfully updated command "!subgoal"
[2:25:37] gaulzen: @5up have u ever grinded/seriously played age of empires?
[2:26:06] blazin_barbie: hehe
[2:26:08] cokopuffz: 5up you gonna play smite 2
[2:27:52] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: It is so crazy to me they are making Smite 2 given how much dev time they still put into Smite.
[2:28:49] JustaStoopidDog: theyre still gonna update one
[2:28:50] cokopuffz: smite 2 is gonna save smite
[2:28:52] CoJefe: Isn't her initial clear a little slower...
[2:29:06] cokopuffz: the reason they made it is cause smite one is on unreal engine 3
[2:29:22] champrath: still not a bad result
[2:29:25] champrath: fizz has no tp
[2:30:15] AkitaAttribute: She has 1 stack
[2:31:00] Lunoria: Fizz is so annoying
[2:31:23] cokopuffz: whoever let fiz be broken needs to be fired
[2:31:24] 24finns: I just finished watching the mcl vod
[2:31:36] 24finns: It was so fun to watch! Good times

[2:35:10] Dia187: interesting, why the three in w early?
[2:35:33] champrath: @Dia187 so you are an actual champ early
[2:35:44] champrath: without w threat and damage he doesnt do anything
[2:36:17] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[2:36:21] zatyna_: talking to vayne
[2:37:36] Dia187: lol yeah idk how hook didnt hit wall there
[2:37:37] champrath: the lollipop part of his q detect terrain later so this happens sometimes KEKW
[2:38:31] champrath: maybe she thinks damage isnt the issue just wants ult up as much as possible
[2:38:36] champrath: it gives nice ult cdr
[2:38:40] Dia187: maybe theyre experimenting with the hexplate Kappa
[2:38:47] cokopuffz: yea that's pretty garbo
[2:39:29] cokopuffz: over kraken especially

[3:39:06] PoteetLee: :|
[3:39:18] vDaishar: Just a lil chat hopping
[3:39:22] Halofan642: i mean im of the opinion that smolder is strong af just a little wonky to play, he plays like a caster rather than an adc and also his stacking mechanic might be weird for ppl
[3:39:28] Halofan642: but also u probably pick up hcamps faster than most ppl
[3:39:53] mlemfloofs: halo humble him dont be scared
[3:40:11] divax0x0: He is pet shaped
[3:40:22] balletbunny: peepoTalk
[3:40:28] Parkjammer: how is smolder compared to other stacking champs? Like Nasus or veigar?
[3:40:39] blazin_barbie: I wonder how many people are playing him
[3:40:58] Halofan642: @mlemfloofs ok let me reclarify, most people are fucking stupid and so him picking up hcamps faster than most ppl still isnt good
[3:41:00] Halofan642: better? :D!
[3:41:23] vDaishar: 3rd most played champ I think?
[3:41:24] mercurial1o1: Based halo
[3:41:24] mlemfloofs: @Halofan642 KEKW
[3:41:33] vDaishar: Might be misremembering that
[3:41:35] mlemfloofs: much better Drake
[3:41:37] FrozenLavaReflector: Multiple of smolders abilities scale off of crit
[3:41:47] FrozenLavaReflector: Like e attacks is based off of crit
[3:42:27] FrozenLavaReflector: He doesnt need mana post ER
[3:42:37] Pyronorm: He's ability focused enough that I see why people think they need the mana

[4:06:59] MisterSophistication: Smolder is literally born with a silver spoon. whenever he calls his mom, she helps him out of any situation and doesn‚Äôt let him learn from mistakes. disgustingly privileged character made by a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù company

[4:14:23] Gragnoth: dark seal is stacked up, do we upgrade it ever?
[4:14:34] Gragnoth: oh, you always have to sell it?

[4:19:47] Synex_ow: wait can someone explain the dorans ring start? i thought smolder was ad
[4:20:26] MisterSophistication: smolder W is busted and has AP ratio
[4:20:42] psyfi6: @Synex_ow he does physical damage but still has ap ratios on his skills. he wants to get stacks early and easiest way to do that is spamming spells so dorans ring gives regen to do that
[4:20:58] Synex_ow: icic
[4:21:15] LethalLlamas: Yeah, Sneaky has been starting dorans ring and putting 3 points into W just for lane. The poke is insane

[5:50:00] AkitaAttribute: Really good hook.  Sad you're not 6 yet
[5:50:29] Poptart_Popcorn: What activates samira's ult?
[5:51:02] st0mpa: dealing damage with different sources
[5:51:18] Poptart_Popcorn: @st0mpa 5upNotes
[5:51:23] SirFred131: @Poptart_Popcorn Samira gets one mark every time she hits an enemy champ with a different attack/ability than the last time she hit one
[5:51:30] st0mpa: so you can get 3 stacks off of auto-Q-auto, but not off of 3 auto's in a row
[5:51:46] Poptart_Popcorn: I played her without bothering to read and was like where my ulti at
[5:52:13] Halofan642: does melee and ranged autos count as diff sources
[5:52:50] SirFred131: I don't think so, but it'd be cool if they did
[5:53:07] psyfi6: @Halofan642 there is no melee auto. the Q can do melee or ranged depending on distance to target
[5:53:42] SirFred131: When she's in melee she autos with her sword, does bonus damage and can't get blocked by Wind Wall
[5:53:43] psyfi6: @Halofan642 or maybe theres melee auto too lol. idk but no difference in stacks between melee/ranged
[5:54:22] Halofan642: ur w will proc two grades too ye
[5:55:49] vDaishar: Awkward

[6:58:13] 9fierce9: Smolder didnt get the execute until like 30 mins
[6:58:15] Joker_GGEZ: ah
[6:58:16] VVIZRRD: I like building Varus to get three quick autos then drop half or more of my target's health with an ability. =D
[6:58:18] coolwaveofcalm: IT‚ÄôS ME
[6:58:24] Joker_GGEZ: well sucks to suck :D

[7:03:10] Joker_GGEZ: that he's on your team
[7:03:19] Joker_GGEZ: ic
[7:03:38] 9fierce9: Did you change your runes off of electrocute?
[7:03:41] lindros1: @9fierce9 You just throw bombs where he is flying towards with zilean and yhes E gets interupted

[7:05:43] Tirmel: @Joker_GGEZ People always want to beat him, but he is too nice to hate?
[7:06:28] PoteetLee: Please
[7:06:36] lindros1: @pureiinsanity How badyou have to be on Zilean to get countered by ASOL
[7:06:37] Fossabot: @pureiinsanity, Please ask for permission to post a link. [warning]
[7:06:51] pureiinsanity: uGG also says Zileans biggest counter is Asol
[7:07:00] pureiinsanity: you guys gaslighting me

[7:09:40] Fossabot: 5upL 5upL 5upL
[7:09:41] pureiinsanity: 2 sites are telling me Asol counters Zilean
[7:09:46] lindros1: ok 42 games
[7:09:53] VVIZRRD: Love Gwen. Great champ.
[7:10:01] JermRF: JermRF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 2 month streak! thats a weird looking smolder, but happy 3+ years friend :D
[7:10:13] Tirmel: JermRF 5upL
[7:10:18] EmmatheRedPanda: Hi Jerm!
[7:10:29] Atredeus: Could be most people don't know how to counter Asol with Zilean.  So in general it'd be a good matchup unless skill ceilings change?
[7:10:40] Gragnoth: does it have to be vi mid? what about vi top?
[7:10:53] JermRF: my god
[7:10:55] JermRF: LMFAO
[7:11:01] lindros1: @pureiinsanity I can tell you that please pick ASOL vs me
[7:11:14] Joker_GGEZ: JORM
[7:11:18] JermRF: man didnt even get to play the game there
[7:11:42] Amazing_Rhino: I heard Harimata was a goat
[7:11:47] blossom_ngi: that waveclear
[7:11:55] pureiinsanity: @lindros1 ok you are built diff i guess
[7:12:09] vDaishar: om
[7:12:09] Gragnoth: lol, wp 5up!
[7:12:09] VVIZRRD: Lol, tree.
[7:12:10] briweb11: not5upClap
[7:12:11] XortedI: damn
[7:12:15] JermRF: wait tree is dead
[7:12:17] JermRF: huh
[7:12:19] briweb11: wp
[7:12:24] SyntheeR: That was a gank and a half
[7:12:26] JermRF: id be fuming if i was ekko
[7:12:44] pureiinsanity: @lindros1 if you give Asol a free lane who's gonna be more useful later?
[7:12:46] Gragnoth: they are nerfing the tree next patch... :( I am big sad, Maokai has been my main top laner for 3 seasons
[7:13:02] VVIZRRD: Yeah that Ekko's gotta be mad.
[7:13:18] wormlock: maokai top will never thrive again Sadge
[7:13:20] Gragnoth: but they are getting rid of his base heal on his passive! Can't they just nerf his support bs? :(
[7:13:22] BluerBlack: I told you few streams ago to try tree KEKW
[7:13:30] Gragnoth: I know! T_T
[7:13:51] wormlock: I think they reducing the mana cost on his q tho
[7:14:14] lindros1: @pureiinsanity I never give him free lane I always go ignite and full laning runes noone else does that maybe.
[7:14:20] coolwaveofcalm: Definitely plated
[7:14:20] JermRF: last time maokai was like main top lane pick, alistar still had an auto reset on his w and you could play him top lane
[7:14:27] Gragnoth: lol
[7:14:36] EmmatheRedPanda: comms goals right there
[7:14:58] SyntheeR: Team don't want to talk shit and distract you
[7:15:38] pureiinsanity: @lindros1 Probably, i dont think most players in general are that thoughtful about the matchup
[7:15:52] JermRF: no counter objective-ing is certainly a choice
[7:15:59] vDaishar: Objectives are for nerds apparently
[7:16:07] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up

[7:16:35] thekatherine: nice!

[7:17:15] UnLegitCombosBH: @5up were you the sub for a team called Life Essence in summer of 2020?
[7:18:04] Gragnoth: @JermRF Mao top was op with Evenshroud last season, and before the abysal mask re-work he would dominate in the top lane
[7:18:10] lindros1: @pureiinsanity I just change runes and summoner spells based on a matchup
[7:18:26] JermRF: LOL

[7:48:47] divax0x0: The kitty didn't chose this
[7:48:56] VVIZRRD: Yuumi just might be the most hated champ.
[7:48:56] jeskieKAT: She reminds me of one of the Aristocats
[7:49:27] jeskieKAT: Marie from the Aristocats
[7:49:43] divax0x0: She's very cute

[7:50:47] vDaishar: Predictions for dodges till a game starts
[7:50:47] SyntheeR: Is dodging punished?
[7:50:54] VengfulDark: Just tell your ADC to go Ramus, and that you saw it in the LPL
[7:50:56] Eleiren: @SyntheeR the opposite basically
[7:51:02] VengfulDark: XD
[7:51:07] Eleiren: you are rewarded for doging
[7:51:23] VengfulDark: It did not do well, but it was funny
[7:51:27] Eleiren: Queue up adc and ask for senna support 5head
[7:51:30] SyntheeR: @eleiren that sounds bad
[7:52:03] divax0x0: Then he gets yelled at and has to mute his whole team and the enemy team
[7:52:13] Pyronorm: @SyntheeR If you dodge you get a 5 minute wait time before you can actually queue for a match, and if you keep doing it it gets worse
[7:52:22] Eleiren: tis the curse of a yuumi player
[7:52:28] tasemane: this is such a troll pick. yummi is so bad
[7:52:54] SyntheeR: Yuumi for 50 gift subs then

[8:35:58] Joker_GGEZ: if you meow ill let you do smolder but it has to be a good meow
[8:36:03] AwesomeTree: @Love__Killing yes, except for graves, graves is 30 subs
[8:36:03] BurnedAether: Singed players are deranged, sion players have mental damage from hitting their head on the tower so much
