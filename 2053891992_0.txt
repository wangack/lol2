[2:50:23] KasadarTV: getting or got?
[2:50:30] drakonken: when u need dmg and hp at the same time shojin is n.1
[2:50:31] Amaresu_: shojin is like 35% basic ability cdr and base cdr on item on top
[2:50:33] Amaresu_: its like .. riven the item
[2:50:40] Amaresu_: its necessary if you wanna play riven like last season etc
[2:50:53] Amaresu_: otherwise you have to play like viper for burst with profane and less cdr until 4 items etc
[2:51:32] jaxinsux: RIOT
[2:51:43] Amaresu_: i think this build is gonna be the build we end up doing on riven like mid season onwards. they will 100% buff ravenous and cleaver and you ll go cleaver instead of serylda eventually but it ll be shojin ravenous cleaver eventually for sure.

[2:56:41] bluebonnetrs: in my low elo he always turns into a terrorist mid-late game. he can be 0-9 in lane and later becomes unkillable with tons of damage
[2:56:42] CursedShadow: i've seen smolder work well in every lane
[2:57:04] CursedShadow: xddICANT the sound effects
[2:57:05] llgangg: that tower is dancing

[3:02:01] bluebonnetrs: vipeAngry
[3:02:43] aphye: its always when you're facing matchups like tryn where the games entirety is decided by level 5 and you have to rely on your jg that your jg is gonna completely ignore the win condition that is tryn losing lane

[3:03:49] Laranthir: KEKW
[3:04:27] aphye: this was a teleport game tbh
[3:04:39] aphye: and play entirely around tp, keep top a stalemate as best as possible
[3:04:54] Laranthir: the only thing I learned from something like this scenario is that you just fight those you can kill and if possible proxy and avoid enemies
[3:05:05] notlaff: tryn RIOT
[3:05:06] specialy101: one crit does 15% of u hp
[3:05:06] JustZekeeeee: Tryndamere main
[3:05:06] Um3ko: why go back in there? you had him low
[3:05:12] drakonken: The day trindamere won
[3:05:21] aphye: @Laranthir you cant proxy vs tryn since he wants to fight 24/7, he'll just chase you perma
[3:05:28] Laranthir: @Um3ko he just heals back
[3:05:28] yousri01: Try ghost flash
[3:05:32] rogaine_saintvicious2: delete trynd.

[3:05:51] ChapitaSan: ChapitaSan subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! hi, how are u today?
[3:05:54] Laranthir: @aphye yeah I know, it is just inting and keeping enemy jung and top busy so your team can make plays at other lanes
[3:05:58] pyx_7: jungle decided not to win i guess
[3:06:12] Laranthir: but thats just a hail mary boring play, nothing interactive or hopeful

[3:53:15] notlaff: from watching doublelift, its like strong early, kinda meh mid game and very op late game
[3:53:15] Zaaner: hes rly weak untill 225 stacks then became op
[3:53:57] irelina_: @Zaaner How do you get stacks on him?

[3:55:01] unleashed2307: i think he late to the stack most of the time tho
[3:55:02] this1neguy: i think the thing is like you have to stack insanely well to get 225 early enough to not be like super weak until late idk
