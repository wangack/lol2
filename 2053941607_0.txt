[0:07:41] mkramer2000: Well nrg is doing better than C9
[0:07:47] supercole2001: @binultwitch Yeah same not really ideal
[0:07:54] binultwitch: @supercole2001 yee
[0:08:00] tonyj199216: Are you watching LCS?
[0:08:24] Auroramarie8008: the jungle king is back CoolCat  how are you doing today? HYPERS
[0:08:28] supercole2001: @binultwitch even 11pm start here for stream is rough
[0:08:43] binultwitch: @supercole2001 yea legit
[0:08:47] mkramer2000: I just think that they need to stop calling teams super teams. I know you were on one of these "super" teams. Do you think it just puts too much pressure on the team to preform well?
[0:08:57] scubasteve932_: is he trolling ? isnt jg crazy strong this patch
[0:09:09] binultwitch: what teams are doing well?
[0:09:49] Offsette7: peepoHey the boy is back at it
[0:09:51] tonyj199216: Blaber and Fudges lack of practice is catching up with them, the league is just better now.
[0:09:54] mkramer2000: That makes sense
[0:10:14] SacredPoultry: The current formula of 2 or 3 seasoned peeps combo'd with 2 or 3 newer ones seems to be working
[0:10:27] mkramer2000: ^
[0:10:45] 2cozy_: So happy to see Bwipo popping off
[0:10:59] solidussovis: Core JJ passed you on the all time lcs assist list. Sadge
[0:11:01] so_dago23: I am liking how competitive this season is, no one is really hard winning or hard losing
[0:11:03] mkramer2000: 100t tl and nrg are tied 4-3
[0:11:13] mkramer2000: For second
[0:11:22] supercole2001: how have queue times been lately?
[0:11:32] tonyj199216: Busio is actually so good
[0:11:39] tonyj199216: Best support in the LCS rn
[0:12:03] SacredPoultry: Gotta come back and resecure your top 10 =P
[0:12:07] grandmakrystal: I like how early you start stream (US time) cause then I can watch during work! haha
[0:12:42] SacredPoultry: I'm REALLY liking how it feels to be playing on current patch for LCS
[0:12:47] mkramer2000: I mean idk what C9 are doing. Their drafts just kinda are boring and it just seems like they are playing to passive
[0:13:13] supercole2001: when is Lillia getting nerfed?
[0:13:32] guiltyprawn: Praise the teacher kaypHYPERS
[0:13:34] Classic112: lethal on xin without a lot of tanks?
[0:13:38] tonyj199216: Pray for TF in this matchup
[0:13:52] TheQuackleDK: I can't help but relish a bit in clown9 fluking. It feels so good to see them fail, and I can't tell you why
[0:14:55] ronswainson: I never seem to heal enough via conqueror to make it worth
[0:15:38] SacredPoultry: C9 always shows up in tourney
[0:15:40] rvend: to how its going on today
[0:15:46] rvend: yo*
[0:15:48] mkramer2000: Well I wonder if one of the problems is that Berserker usually will only play what LCK plays and since they aren't on the same patch and LCK is behind it might cause problems in that sense
[0:16:12] tonyj199216: Heard the other day that bot lane is the 7th secret camp in jg clear, worth 700g most ppl dont know about it.
[0:16:22] GardenCrane: o7
[0:16:26] rvend: @tonyj199216 lmao
[0:16:31] mkramer2000: Either what LCK is doing nerfed on live and something else is better

[0:20:06] ntmadeit: yoo

[0:25:39] mkramer2000: Yeah but is it a general sniper riven? I don't think so
[0:27:02] mkramer2000: Also off topic to now but why the hell would c9 just give up grubs to a team with ziggs? He was just melting  the turrets like butter
[0:27:29] ucandoit69: C9 looking a bit lost tbh
[0:28:04] SacredPoultry: help bot by putting them in the backpack, showem the classic santorin carry

[2:55:13] jjaqqq: kamelåså
[2:55:37] solidussovis: Pretty sure you are just going with the biggest CHAD move ever
[2:55:44] Iamaf33d3r: i just fixed our stove

[2:57:24] KAZERKE: KEKL
[2:57:50] Khitchary_: ive never seen a 'big' streamer (anyone with 100s instead of 10s of viewers) with ttv in their name
[2:59:02] xbentu: ttv usually brings flamers lmao
[3:00:00] Khitchary_: ill take passive lane bot that turns into a bloodbath for no reason for 100 points
[3:00:04] paradisi_: do you agree that most league games are decided on champ select? just happened to me, so helpless
[3:00:08] solidussovis: Vi is very good here

[3:01:22] paradisi_: LUL
[3:01:27] Khitchary_: there is a lot of content on youtube which advises people to OTP
[3:01:48] orep__: You dont like hail of blades on vi?
[3:03:04] solidussovis: Jungle mains need at least 1 AD, AP, and Tank in there champ pool
[3:03:06] paradisi_: udyr otp are having a blast this patch lmao
[3:04:04] Cactus_Cactar: Breaking up with my otp was hard but climbing feels good
[3:04:21] solidussovis: Look at Corki mains for the past 2 years. Those went nonexistent until this season
[3:05:01] sebastianminiatures: YOINK

[3:11:28] worldparadise420: Holy S... that kind of jng diff behavior happens in High elo too xyllowWTF
[3:11:32] sebastianminiatures: Garen takes bounty and resets gold
[3:11:34] bonusdmg2noobs: garen actually should uninstall. his gameplay is pure toxic
[3:12:26] solidussovis: he ults the wrong target !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????
[3:12:37] shadow7master: point click is too hard man
[3:12:53] solidussovis: ok Garen = Brain dead champ but some people lack even a dead brain
[3:13:02] bonusdmg2noobs: how does a player like this Garen actually get out of gold mmr?
[3:13:32] shadow7master: @bonusdmg2noobs get carried every game

[3:16:18] worldparadise420: Jinx not gonna listen to VI in game nor in Arance series
[3:16:44] solidussovis: Ksante was basically taunting you. He wanted to step up on you
[3:17:29] solidussovis: and your Garen is losing to that. It's so disheartening
[3:18:26] shadow7master: KEKW

[3:19:03] sebastianminiatures: they turned Jinx into a melee champ this patch?
[3:19:07] tugwos: Best melee Jinx player EU
[3:19:19] Khitchary_: jinx has this thing after a takedown where her movepseed becomes 0 and she is immobile you see so eh cannot get out of melee
[3:19:24] bonusdmg2noobs: Guys Jungle is just TOO OP, laners arent allowed to express their skill gaps.  WE MUST NERF JUNGLE MOAR !
[3:19:53] solidussovis: @Khitchary_ oh I thought it was the total opposite of that. So I was wondering why she wasn't doing anything
[3:20:00] solidussovis: Thank you for setting me straight
[3:20:04] Khitchary_: anyime mate
[3:20:14] solidussovis: KEW
[3:20:22] Khitchary_: I used to think she got a speed boost too but it turns out only when its an enemy jinx
[3:21:03] solidussovis: Still a good fight just could have been better
[3:21:05] shadow7master: swain is raid boss man
[3:21:06] theppcharlie: They stoled the dragon
[3:21:18] Dipseas: They stoled the dragon

[3:26:24] Offsette7: @Dezrunner there is a guy who is a oven master fixer
[3:26:49] worldparadise420: u think Nunu is stronger this season ?
[3:27:08] Dezrunner: Not really... just the light fried and issues with the heating element... overdue for ages hehe
[3:28:30] solidussovis: I had a flooded basement last week. Home ownership soooo much fun
[3:28:45] KyCerealKiller: Do you know the pantheon jungle that plays in challenger? I saw there is one but I dont know the players name so I can look them up.

[3:33:40] DJ_Photik: I haven't tried those two yet
[3:35:44] iiNumb3rz: Vit just locked in ksante. Can you believe it?
[3:36:05] KyCerealKiller: how much do you think the brand an lillia nerfs will affect their viability?
[3:36:19] iiNumb3rz: Brand a little. Lillia a good bit
[3:36:26] iiNumb3rz: But lillia really needa the nerf
[3:36:40] iiNumb3rz: Whos more broken that ksante? Besides lillia
[3:37:13] Offsette7: who are the next broken jungler?
[3:37:34] shadow7master: ksante and briar they counter themselfs
[3:37:56] hey_im_rabid: running it down this game plus that hour long loading screen feels bad man
[3:37:59] iiNumb3rz: Graves
[3:38:00] DallinS: wu getting buffed

[3:38:32] hey_im_rabid: Wukong was my first ever main LUL
[3:39:04] gymleaderjusten: maybe play some games you never play while you recover?
[3:39:05] KyCerealKiller: thats why i dont fight level 1. i always end up on the losing end
[3:39:10] iiNumb3rz: Nautilus love sending it.
[3:39:16] iiNumb3rz: They can't help it
[3:39:25] shadow7master: clown fiesta challenger lvl

[3:42:02] Duck_ruler: Honestly after like 1 day / night you should be good
[3:42:33] MoistGiraffe21: getting them out is the best thing ive had done.
[3:42:39] cjcunn506: I was a little sore. lotta yogurt and soft foods but it didn’t take long to heal
[3:43:27] tala____: He's an ADC main, Draven mostly lmao
[3:43:32] Duck_ruler: Akali W
[3:43:37] sebastianminiatures: I love farming, pve so peaceful

[3:43:44] KyCerealKiller: bro, do yourself a favor and get one of those headwraps off of amazong that come with ice packs. they will help a lot. they are so worth it
[3:45:05] Neaxz: Lets do some arena then :)
[3:45:26] Zeiik101: mine grew in completely fucking sideways. they had to break it to remove it
[3:45:38] Mikytka: Yo my dude, what are we talking about, wisdom teeth?
[3:45:44] Zeiik101: yeah
[3:45:51] BurritoTX: its not to bad. mine was similar. after a day its mainly just sore. nothing crazy.

[3:49:02] Calypse10: ty
[3:49:04] KyCerealKiller: @Santorin how do I deal with players in low elo who refuse to help take objectives when free? Do I just risk the objective or should I pull off and farm?
[3:50:12] xbentu: Zven isn't currently on a team right?
[3:51:08] Zeiik101: has umuted, has muted

[4:27:55] Dezrunner: Haha, wife just said: Who is that screaming in your ear? Me: That is Lucas =D. Her: He sounds really worked up
[4:28:21] the_violentpanda: pumping the bounty
[4:28:50] KyCerealKiller: i thought original gragas didnt cook. it was just flat damage
[4:30:02] KyCerealKiller: i am just coming back to this game from a long time ago so this is all new to me
[4:30:05] iiNumb3rz: Lcs calls gonna be coming in if you keep winning 80% of your games lol
[4:31:42] iiNumb3rz: Can you text hans sama say draven plz? I need a draven game
[4:32:17] iiNumb3rz: Lich bane changes may hurt gragas no?
[4:32:53] Chaewon5: you are rank 21?]
[4:33:17] iiNumb3rz: You are qiyana cursed. Every qiyana you get is iron 4. Every enemy is beifang
[4:33:30] iiNumb3rz: @chaewon5 rank 1 in our hearts
[4:33:52] Chaewon5: my friend has told me santorin was bad so i had a hard time believeing my friednd
[4:34:08] iiNumb3rz: Lol who told you that?

[4:34:39] iiNumb3rz: He's like quite literally one of the best jng in lcs history
[4:34:40] Chaewon5: @iiNumb3rz nmy friend
[4:35:09] iiNumb3rz: Your friend lied to you bro
[4:36:05] iiNumb3rz: Shots fired
[4:36:09] tugwos: don't mess with the fat man
[4:36:17] Chaewon5: yeah i hear him say that too but i do not listen to what tarzaned sauy
[4:36:19] Chaewon5: too toxic for me
[4:36:30] iiNumb3rz: Rank 10 in euw but bad. I can't kekw
[4:36:42] Chaewon5: why leg player big ego?:/
[4:36:47] solidussovis: Team fighting? I have heard of this in league, but am unfamiliar with how it works.
[4:37:01] iiNumb3rz: Just from viewing I went from bronze 4 to nearly plat
[4:37:32] iiNumb3rz: @solidussovis I think its where everyone walks mid and fights after 14 minutes
[4:38:08] iiNumb3rz: I still don't understand how you have 19 KP and like 7 cs/m though.
[4:38:17] solidussovis: That sounds interesting style of play
[4:38:53] iiNumb3rz: Beifang confirmed
[4:39:05] solidussovis: This team fighting thing seems to be working out for you Santo. It must be high elo strat
[4:39:18] KyCerealKiller: what is team is the real question
[4:39:34] thebigcat32: @iiNumb3rz Seems odd. Myteam prefers to split push when there is no pressure anywhere else on map, effectively running into 3-4 people
[4:39:37] TimeWizardLuL: why not mej
[4:39:39] iiNumb3rz: @kycerealkiller the people who usually try to make the game harder for you to win
[4:39:49] solidussovis: @KyCerealKiller I know that one. It's the 4 people you have to play against to beat the enemy team
[4:40:08] iiNumb3rz: Seems to be a general consensus on team mates in chat
[4:40:50] iiNumb3rz: That flash though
[4:41:06] iiNumb3rz: I want sports science to review that reaction time
[4:42:11] lubemila: swoloW
[4:42:44] duckpinbowler: heya! glad to see the games are going better.
[4:42:49] iiNumb3rz: Why did the r not knock him back there?
[4:43:22] solidussovis: why did Tal take flash? She seems to pointlessly keep it on CD for the enemy.
[4:44:39] solidussovis: But Santo hit the gym and is carrying more weight then yesterday
[4:44:40] 05dani: bomba
