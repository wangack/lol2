[0:37:30] BeholdTheCrab: traps only worth focusing on if you build shadowflame along with liandrys and miligma imo
[0:38:01] Layxo: traps are wards that can slow that's all Kappa
[0:39:24] BeholdTheCrab: I think if your team is on board playing around traps and going for picks you can go for it, but its in ideal world
[0:39:58] LeonardoAssumpcao: Maybe give RoA another shot.. the extra level is appealing
[0:41:11] BeholdTheCrab: So full ap build would be aery, lich bane, shadowflame?
[0:41:19] BeholdTheCrab: for one shots
[0:41:52] Layxo: the worst kind of  gamble
