[0:47:18] HydroMerano: One good thing about Kayn building so much lethality is, he's useless against tanks (most of the time), and he's pretty squishy, though Red Kayn is scary still T_T
[0:47:23] Jae_Niko: @darkcyter hey budd kaypHello kaypHello

[0:48:02] xBoomShotBaby: i played against him the other day, we literally did no dmg to him..
[0:48:03] theenation97: I think the justification for not having items like that is the fact that a big part of being a mage is positioning. staying out of the range to take damage, but the reality is different when you‚Äôre vs champs like kayne
[0:48:10] darthcrudus: 9 games in a row loss not maybe 1 or two my fault but usually mid or top running it down....

[2:52:04] reallycreativ: Was there a prediction for this game?
[2:52:16] gre_13: belveth wanted to do it perfectly in time
[2:52:24] TorqueBandit: Sometimes I intentionally hit cait traps assuming they wont disengage from baron or to bait, but I max at plat 4 so.... :)

[2:57:02] Rincewurst: @TorqueBandit kaypea plays the hwei which is why the hp bar is yellow
[2:57:14] ferriswheel8: I finished my chores and i am locking in for the rest of the stream kaypFlower  How have the previous games been?
[2:57:18] reallycreativ: Mf literally decided to stay alone and ambush them lol

[2:57:52] ghost_doggo7: kaenic rookeern
[2:57:54] Rincewurst: @CanerRush its a wordplay on KayPea -> KP -> Karma Pengu ^^ I guess because her favorite emote is the hats of penguin in game
[2:58:10] Rincewurst: hats off*
[2:58:40] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea that‚Äôs how it all starts, everyone forgets about smolder then suddenly he has enough stacks to one shot ü•≤
[2:58:42] TorqueBandit: cannot didnt get pushed from that spell, was that glitched
[2:59:02] TorqueBandit: cannon

[3:00:23] kingprime: I mean ppl will hate me for this and I dont mean to be rude but you used like half of Hwei's kit.. and yes I know youre still new to him :D
[3:00:54] d0gma06: thx for nice time i go sleep hf all
[3:01:00] kingprime: NoNo I see what the problem was
[3:01:06] itsAriEve: monday games tbh </3
[3:01:07] ghost_doggo7: season 14 is dogshit anyways
[3:01:25] alolovely: the problem was Camille was support but was not supporting anyone just engaging and dying
[3:01:28] tacozzzzkekw: @kingprime her team was the problem though...and you say she used half her kit and she was still popping off tho so
[3:01:46] mahducontilde: let's go back to yasuo mid KP Kappa
[3:01:47] TorqueBandit: what if she didnt need to use her whole kit?
[3:01:48] chaotix_wolf: Just saw my gifted sub! Awesome! and thanks to guiltyprawn!
[3:01:52] viliviki: hwei gives me headache i am dumb for the combos
[3:01:56] kingprime: Okay then
[3:02:03] itsAriEve: even as a mid laning mage player with all these items and things supposed to be good for us, so not a fan
[3:02:20] Galetea: you were right tho, camille kept trying to engage and then their team would steam roll after she was killed. She just needed to let you and mf poke them and then engage once they were low/illaoi ripped a soul
[3:02:26] sovitiaisavampire: kaypFreya back sits all the time
[3:02:30] kingprime: @tacozzzzkekw does that mean you cant still improve?^^

[3:03:25] tacozzzzkekw: @kingprime I mean she's doing fine...are you a pro player?
[3:03:25] ferriswheel8: @jimbob_ywert that'd be amazing üôè
[3:03:38] QTwinkyyy: Yeah honestly and the problem is everyone has their unique playstyle. If everyone gives their own opinion it's just gonna be a shitshow. kaypHUH
[3:03:43] jstutey: we only come to share the love
[3:03:52] Smoothcollie: Im doing it all the time, just in my mind kaypCaptainMaple
[3:03:55] itsAriEve: hey yeah idk if you knew this kels, but you right click to move your champ. just to lyk!
[3:03:57] kingprime: Never said I could do better but I see I messed up. I apologize
[3:03:58] TorqueBandit: BASED

[3:05:37] ferriswheel8: Honestly if i had to take league seriously i'd end up in an asylum veery quickly kaypLUL
[3:05:37] Riikkuuuu: @Smoothcollie My mum backseats while im dricing and i swear to god
[3:05:46] LittleMoxie: also, sometimes we get excited and forget about the no backseating, passion is dangerous, but we have to have discipline birdofCozy

[3:06:26] Oval819: why backseat when you can trunk instead. way more room back here.
[3:06:36] tallwastaken: is annoying but League at the end of the day is a team game and you can‚Äôt control teammates. all you can do is control your gameplay O_o
[3:06:42] DShoun: good thing i dont know this game.. i got no back seating i can offer LUL

[3:07:33] jimbob_ywert: Is diamond our goal for this season?
[3:07:36] ferriswheel8: @itsAriEve THISSS, istg its so exhausting when i cannot even name most of the recent champs introduced into the game

[3:10:07] alolovely: still way more positive than I would be after those games lol
[3:10:14] jimbob_ywert: my friend reached masters and then the next day demoted to DIAMONED 3 üò≠
[3:10:18] tacozzzzkekw: Diana with stormsurge and hourglass is so cringe
[3:10:21] jakabolta: its very hard to matchmake good tho you have to understand that people will have bad and good games for example if someone has very good game and second game they get aufofiled they cant play good you know what i mean?
[3:10:24] leggingsPT: @kingprime I've read its on
[3:10:30] justchatta: hey kelsie <3
[3:10:35] theenation97: emerald is the rank before diamond right?
[3:10:36] jstutey: your version upset is way more calm then mine is for sure

[3:10:47] vanna_rl: I know you said u have a ton to learn but I just wanted u to know KP I learned a lot by watching u, both in gameplay and positivity I think u made me a better League player
[3:10:56] l3arbimolzit: hard to implement ! players will be selfish and solo Q wwill become the new hell

[3:11:17] Sunnytinker: kaypAnnoyed
[3:11:18] ericaborgest: i think that would be good for losses, but for wins would just make everyone be a kda player, no?
[3:11:19] RaynKire: Lucky for me I'm getting about 29LP a win and 16 for a loss. Need to play more ranked games. 82% winrate, I suppose I could get out of Silver real quick if I just play some ranked
[3:11:33] K4stAway: Smurfs are absolutely destroying the game

[3:13:49] tacozzzzkekw: @subertus aram
[3:14:03] subertus: @tacozzzzkekw respect. fistbump bro
[3:14:15] tacozzzzkekw: @subertus I can't handle ranked lol
[3:14:39] xBoomShotBaby: wait why does it show lvl 17 on op.gg then
[3:14:57] jimbob_ywert: Kindred marked you
[3:14:57] subertus: @tacozzzzkekw can't blame you
[3:15:01] jimbob_ywert: that‚Äôs scary
[3:15:07] LythelliaBelmont: OP.GG Says he is exactly lvl 30
[3:15:09] theenation97: is that the new Janna skin? has that come out yet?
[3:15:12] Lenox013: It's the political thought process . .  if it can't be fixed 100% then there's no point to try
[3:15:16] tacozzzzkekw: @subertus fist bump
[3:15:28] milenco_bo: they do that for the poke early
[3:15:35] ObsceneSanity: dorians ring is a better start item for smolder bc of dmg
[3:15:48] jimbob_ywert: AP smolder sucks, it has horrible wr, maybe it‚Äôs hope
[3:15:57] tacozzzzkekw: Tyler1 kept saying how smolder was trash lol
[3:16:06] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea that Doran‚Äôs ring let‚Äôs your W poke be more annoying
[3:16:28] ericaborgest: I played versus smolder adc yesterday and he went ad
[3:16:33] rimorollin: its tto help him wave clear because his q doesnt do enough damage until he has a decent amount of stacks
[3:16:47] Sunnytinker: his other games the smolder went full ad so must just be fore early game poke
[3:16:49] l3arbimolzit: well you might be right but as long as riot didnt try this and come up with data ! none can guarantee that what you are saying is gonna solve the issue rather than making it worst
[3:17:25] GamerChickVic: @Sunnytinker who's smolder? Draven?
[3:17:30] xBoomShotBaby: Lux is kinda on a losing streak
[3:17:54] tacozzzzkekw: @xboomshotbaby  it's cuz of the skin
[3:18:10] kingprime: Smolder comet with Dorans Ring and Dark seal -> 3 points W early some sort of Korean build
[3:18:26] kremmalionwy: hello KP! Happy to catch you on vacation! How are you doing?
[3:18:46] lilsuru_: Wouldn't that create a game where people only care about their KDA?
[3:18:46] jimbob_ywert: The kindred Jg is a mid main lol
[3:18:47] xBoomShotBaby: @tacozzzzkekw kaypTroll she had the cosmic one originally, but changed it the last seconds i think
[3:18:48] Smoothcollie: kaypVibe kaypVibe kaypVibe
[3:19:00] tacozzzzkekw: @xboomshotbaby darn
[3:19:23] Sunnytinker: @GamerChickVic he's the new champ, the dragon
[3:19:24] theenation97: hmm this Lux is a little. . .hm
[3:19:32] shamneo: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:19:34] ferriswheel8: Lux is too aggressive at this point
[3:19:41] ericaborgest: wot
[3:19:41] K4stAway: Please take Valves stance with Dota, make smurfing a bannable offense
[3:20:07] RadiantWisp: dragon supposed to be lategame
[3:20:11] GamerChickVic: @Sunnytinker Oh, I didn't know another one was already released lol
[3:20:35] BlackNovaQ42: went back and watched the clip lux missed 2 q's my eyes
[3:20:42] TorqueBandit: that came out of nowhere LOL
[3:20:51] jimbob_ywert: Gosh why are games so rough recently
[3:20:59] theenation97: lol I wonder what shen did for brand to say that
[3:21:14] jimbob_ywert: HOW DID SHE DODGE THAT Q?
[3:21:21] l3arbimolzit: absolutely ! forgot about these , i totally agree ! but come on dont you think that a lot of players would be not willing to take risks in order to help a teammate in fear of not getting an S ?
[3:21:28] BlackNovaQ42: that was a sus dodge ngl
[3:21:41] Smoothcollie: @lilsuru_ No cuz as Kels just said, it woudln't be based on kda. S system isn't based on kda only as well. Ofc some people would play for kda. But there are already these people. and if everyone would play for kda, u wouldn't likely win
[3:21:58] tacozzzzkekw: Watch the vod lol
[3:22:01] The1997wiki: what elo they are
[3:22:02] Soff199: why does riot hate you this much tho, these games are insane
[3:22:08] ferriswheel8: You know what's funny? Literally everytime i play pajama guardian lux i miss all of my stuff, its like a curse kaypAwkward
[3:22:15] The1997wiki: they play soo well even
[3:22:34] xueshidao: janna is too skinni
[3:22:49] Smoothcollie: Nah actually the last Q doesnt look like it should hit when u replay it
[3:23:02] BlackNovaQ42: hard to tell since lux is having it rough regardless
[3:23:03] stk_psc_HH: hi friends PotFriend
[3:23:04] ericaborgest: lol ??
[3:23:04] quark978: you placed two traps, he just didnt realize it

[3:23:28] l3arbimolzit: @lilsuru_ kda is a big part in deciding whether you get an S or not, so i trust that league players would become much more toxic in their gameplay ir order to make sure thay would get a higher score
[3:23:32] tacozzzzkekw: Brands playing goat simulator
[3:23:34] stk_psc_HH: @ferriswheel8 hi PotFriend
[3:23:49] quark978: stormrazer good
[3:23:49] jimbob_ywert: Storm razor into infinity edge
[3:23:55] Riikkuuuu: some lifesteal might help with the lane too
[3:23:59] Daddy_Shoe: hi Kaypea and chat, hope all is well. I‚Äôm down almost 10lbs this year!
[3:24:01] ericaborgest: get kraken for sylas and udyr, no?
[3:24:06] The1997wiki: nope sike i just play away
[3:24:07] tacozzzzkekw: Shiv not good?
[3:24:18] bemyresset: stormrazer, titanic hydra then IE works nicely
[3:24:20] BlackNovaQ42: LUX PLEASE
[3:24:25] CptTrizZy: lol u did miss that trap tho tbf, he is jus mad tho no reeason to be a dickhead

[3:24:57] ferriswheel8: this lux just has to chill, she is good after all
[3:24:57] lilsuru_: @l3arbimolzit 100% agree with this opinion and why I think KDA based lo would be terrible
[3:25:30] The1997wiki: he is 0/5
[3:25:30] jimbob_ywert: brand already 0/5
[3:25:31] MaasawDreamt: he'll be okay :)
[3:25:52] viliviki: i mean he dies every 2 minutes
[3:25:53] Smoothcollie: @l3arbimolzit But if majory of community would do that, your team made off 5 kda players would 100 % lose. So yes, mby at the begining when rito would aply this ther would be higher rise of these people. But they would eventually figure out it's no use and it would - hopefully - fall down
[3:25:57] RE_BlackDrag0n: need spend asap
[3:26:07] ericaborgest: Kappa
[3:26:15] ericaborgest: teammates am I right?

[3:29:28] tacozzzzkekw: @harumisenni  pajama lol
[3:29:35] ragtimediddly: It's fine, Udyr is due his 53rd rework
[3:29:43] Smoothcollie: @l3arbimolzit I mean u wont give anything for to try it right. But tell that to riot. If it owuldnt be that way, just remove it. But at least try it Sadge
[3:29:49] AkuaDwarf: @AkuaDwarf ooooh smart
[3:29:52] ericaborgest: get collector
[3:29:52] lilsuru_: Every stance, ability, has like a 2 - 4 seconds CD
[3:29:56] killuax4x: yup
[3:29:58] Harumisenni: @tacozzzzkekw with the star guardian skills
[3:30:13] lnes_: feel you, emerald is such a mess :((
[3:30:19] quark978: unfortunately, you aren't a fed ADC which gives you very little control over the game at this point
[3:30:34] theenation97: why is brand flaming the shen like that omg
[3:30:35] ferriswheel8: honestly, at this point, after that many losses over the few streams i guarantee you, your chill attitude is the most impressive thing ive ever encountered in my life, you really are amazing @KayPea kaypComfy kaypLove
[3:30:50] houseofbalioons: Isn't that a good thing ?
[3:31:02] Smoothcollie: The trap kaypSpy Did u'all see that
[3:31:17] jimbob_ywert: why‚Äôre they so hard to kill? it‚Äôs like it takes a gazillion autos to get them just low
[3:31:22] l3arbimolzit: @l3arbimolzit i would love to experiment it so that i can forge an opinion about it and not just theory
[3:31:40] RaynKire: What is this Udyr building to be so tanky
[3:31:44] Psychology___: Bruh this Udys
[3:31:51] Psychology___: Might need LDR
[3:31:55] itsAriEve: gotta love sylas smh
[3:32:02] 1to60hc: Where is SIVHD @KayPea
[3:32:17] ericaborgest: you need LDR for udyr asap Madge
[3:32:20] ericaborgest: so BS
[3:32:33] viliviki: riot just likes to humiliate adcs
[3:32:37] jimbob_ywert: isn‚Äôt infinity edge better as second?
[3:32:40] CptTrizZy: serpents a decent buy this game
[3:32:44] tinyyy912: Serpent fang
[3:32:46] ragtimediddly: everything being equally bullshit is how dota is balanced kaypTroll
[3:32:53] The1997wiki: even aram is fck up when other team gets ahead is over
[3:32:55] Galetea: serpant would be nice yeah for sheilds
[3:32:57] tacozzzzkekw: Dota sucks
[3:33:02] ragtimediddly: arguably works a lot better at the moment lol
[3:33:29] Smoothcollie: Isnt lethality Cait a thing again? She might be better into some comps than normal Cait
[3:33:29] lilsuru_: The under doesn't even have enough mastery on the champ to reach lvl 4 is so suspicious
[3:33:31] Psychology___: yeah even ARAM's aren't that fun this season
[3:33:42] Smoothcollie: Just a ranodm thought
[3:34:20] viliviki: healing udyr with shots is a new level of craazyy
[3:34:22] BayFlame: <3 <3 <3
[3:34:24] ericaborgest: the ballz on that brand Kappa
[3:34:37] ericaborgest: you can still get collector @KayPea :)
[3:34:38] The1997wiki: she has to have smartcast there is no way
[3:34:41] iishambles: Janna is rampage KEKW
[3:34:53] jimbob_ywert: isn‚Äôt I fit edge better as second
[3:34:53] killuax4x: after ie you gonna do damage well
[3:34:59] Galetea: this brand talks a lot for not doing anything with a broken champ
[3:35:07] CptTrizZy: LUL classic league chat
[3:35:12] Smoothcollie: Brand completely lost it kaypAwkward
[3:35:14] ericaborgest: omg he's so toxic
[3:35:15] viliviki: brand is playing a tank in his mind
[3:35:23] pichu_uwu_: yeah 1/9 on that champ is kinda insane, he's so overtuned adasGASP
[3:35:27] Wunkerton: Havent seen lux and a q... but this brand is beyond toxic for being 1-9...
[3:35:27] Smoothcollie: Lux as well, what's happpeeeening
[3:35:31] ericaborgest: KEKW
[3:35:57] xLippyy: are we winning today??
[3:35:59] tacozzzzkekw: Healing and shields on him
[3:36:06] RaynKire: Serpents is good against shields
[3:36:08] tacozzzzkekw: The riftmaker tho
[3:36:21] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea fk it, get serpents fang on Caitlyn. I know it‚Äôs not good on ranged but what can you do against udyr üò¨
[3:36:26] lawfulevil_13: Holy damage
[3:36:26] viliviki: the music
[3:36:31] Alice_bookie: and the ghost‚Äôs CD as well is ridiculous
[3:36:34] The1997wiki: the 6/0 janna lol
[3:36:36] ericaborgest: meanwhile the raid boss in your base monkaS
[3:36:37] Smoothcollie: U are slowly but surely getting fed, if only u had more time Sadge

[3:37:12] mr_sizzler007: when will the DRX skin be available for purchase ?
[3:37:17] RaynKire: This Udyr is not even building tank items but he's unkillable. He has like half a tank item
[3:37:44] viliviki: you are the most positive person alive at this point
[3:37:49] tacozzzzkekw: @raynkire it's so dumb
[3:37:55] iishambles: it's not like we're surprised lol, it's our daily struggle too

[3:42:35] ragtimediddly: I legit uninstalled this season. Game is just unenjoyable at the moment. Even the good games suck ass lol
[3:42:39] tacozzzzkekw: Can we see the early lux qs after in the vod?

[3:45:28] xBoomShotBaby: Lux is her main too sadly
[3:45:32] Niomah: I suspect the other team was scripting the way they were dodging
[3:45:33] The1997wiki: can you check her profile ?
[3:45:33] tinyyy912: Ziggs is the only way to win
[3:45:33] tacozzzzkekw: Can we see the q that glitched lol

[3:47:39] l3arbimolzit: !EU
[3:47:39] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[3:47:46] CptTrizZy: im 60+% wr in emerald and still get terrible gains
[3:47:57] 4busedolphin: idk whats up with matchmaking
[3:48:03] 4busedolphin: they make it easier to fall through
[3:48:05] mrshibasan: DAAMN that's bad.....
[3:48:21] l3arbimolzit: what do you think about EUW server compared to NA ?
[3:48:22] viliviki: the problem for me is that won games don't compensate for the lost ones mentally
[3:48:31] tacticalcodemonkeys: whats killing me is the matchups.  they are putting people 2 full ranks a part in the same lane against each other.  Like what can you do when your iron teemo feeds a fiora and shes +4 levels
[3:48:33] quark978: rough day for LP
[3:48:34] fuzzlion: how did u like hwei?
[3:48:39] keedroneys: thats a big reason why i couldnt get into this game. My first 15 games EVER in ranked and i lost 14. My team would just walk into towers and die.
