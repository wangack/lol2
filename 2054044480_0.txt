[5:20:22] pikapika_666_: it was decided in early game
[5:20:58] darkeisbein: I think recurve bow is a good start because you can still pivot AD or AP of of that depending on if your opponent is looking to build Rookern or not

[5:48:16] ParkingSeal: ð #Ithink,therefore Ipav
[5:48:25] goodboymattyp: I hope all is swell with you Mr Ipav, what build would you say could be decent as a standard, every game build for teemo in lower elo?
[5:51:56] Shanierd513: Ya everything u think about phase rush teemo, it just makes me want pta for damage
[5:52:08] Shanierd513: Everything i*
[5:52:22] Shanierd513: Everytime
[5:52:47] Shanierd513: Phone correction
[5:53:10] Shanierd513: Ahhh TRUE
[5:53:27] Shanierd513: I didn't think about that
[5:53:51] goodboymattyp: I feel like thats why most people play shroom builds teemos, because you technically dont need to worry about getting ahead/behind in lane, because your shrooms are technically useful all stages of games etc, but can often still give yourself no solo power I guess
[5:54:56] goodboymattyp: Phase rush can also save you often from own mistakes etc too
[5:58:22] goodboymattyp: This Taliyah perma invading
[5:58:44] Aldurfus: can't catch up even with w Smoge
