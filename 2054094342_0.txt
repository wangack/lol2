[0:52:38] CESlush: @Dylza welcome to twitch? lol
[0:53:15] honorthebeast_: Just type u dont care ur banning smolder and ban it
[0:53:17] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/chaseshaco
[0:53:18] Dylza: cool im getting ganged up on now, just simply my opinion that the champ hasn't had enough time to be experimented with yet but it probably needs a buff
[0:53:19] honorthebeast_: i do that too
[0:53:48] jakfrost49: you look like a young / skinnier version of Jay Cutler
[0:53:56] weeiizz__: is the mic shit or is it my headphones
[0:54:10] false_monk: Dylza you went against a fact that Smoulder is very bad in his current state. The only argument you used was some guy Ive never heard of. Not to mention welcome to the internet, people can be condescending all they want basically.
[0:54:10] Dylza: @ChaseShaco yeah its a fair call i say ban that champ so your team cant int on it haha
[0:54:53] kemia1987: hahah nice tier list love it
