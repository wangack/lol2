[0:41:16] YourJanitor: that shaco vid was cringe. I'd describe shaco as a 'look ahead assassin'. You kind of have to know what's going to happen and put the box down in a way that will benefit you, otherwise you can easily die.
[0:41:34] Shaco_Illusion: 5Head Comparision
[0:41:36] YourJanitor: this dude talks about the box like it's some magic ability, but it can easily be destroyed and has a wind-up time. very hard to use mid-fight

[1:48:11] HazareNae: 590 damage on 1 1/2 item Aatrox on Q 2
[1:48:13] HazareNae: How dumb is that
[1:48:24] lol_Toxicc: nothing you can do chase idk
[1:48:29] lol_Toxicc: your team is trolling so hard
[1:49:04] Skyz_Ninjaz: the fact that your singed hasnt built heal cut yet blows my mind....
[1:49:12] lol_Toxicc: yea no heal cut is crazy
[1:49:22] lol_Toxicc: v aatrox
[1:49:25] HazareNae: Heal's abit out of control right now tbh
[1:49:25] Galkaria: @Skyz_Ninjaz his ultimate is a heal cut LUL
[1:49:43] lol_Toxicc: he might need more
[1:49:48] Skyz_Ninjaz: @Galkaria good coms, I forgot about that one
[1:49:59] HazareNae: Griev doesn't stack iirc?
[1:50:13] HazareNae: Kinda like slows, the stronger effect takes prio?
[1:50:20] Skyz_Ninjaz: correct
[1:50:29] whalechoker: @HazareNae exactly the same
[1:50:46] HazareNae: Okay wasn't sure but that's what made sense to me klinkHappy
[1:51:18] Skyz_Ninjaz: I think all heal cut is just 40% now tho right?
[1:51:23] Galkaria: it is
[1:51:24] HazareNae: I think so
[1:51:27] whalechoker: AD items also dont stack so only buy 1 AD item and rest tank chshLaugh

[1:52:43] HazareNae: i think Griev should be back to 60% tbh
[1:52:55] HazareNae: This season things seem to heal a weebit too much
[1:53:36] Galkaria: they chased the singed
[1:53:39] Galkaria: LMFAO
