[0:34:44] Kylon1235: sheesh
[0:34:50] austn00: another gragas
[0:34:58] Senc788: gragas matchup sucks
[0:35:11] Kylon1235: wait no gragas ban?
[0:35:17] Zuloo_RebelScum: Do you have primal skin @Viper
[0:36:09] xm1rr: hard game
[0:36:20] austn00: gragas feels very anti riven
[0:36:24] Reads__: hello
[0:36:25] NothHellNoaKnight: pigie champ for pigies
[0:37:24] catJAMenjoyer: gragas outplayed you (he pressed E)
[0:37:40] ゴミ: ive seen baus lose this matchup
[0:37:57] doublemeatpalace: baus ints though lol
[0:38:10] AntcliffLIVE: gragas passive is op man
[0:38:16] hyper_camm: I'm convinced gragas is the best champ in the game
[0:38:17] austn00: his mana
[0:38:19] xm1rr: dia gragas maybe
[0:38:35] C0nk1: hex rush no good?
[0:38:56] austn00: i think mercs tenacity is good
[0:39:07] NothHellNoaKnight: i mean he has but before recall
[0:39:19] NothHellNoaKnight: first recall*
[0:39:19] Kylon1235: every gragas seems to use so much mana till they get low on mana than its like they have infinite mana for some reason
[0:39:20] catJAMenjoyer: Tenacity against gragas is kinda useless since his E knocks you up
[0:39:52] austn00: @catJAMenjoyer ahhh i see i see
[0:40:01] AntcliffLIVE: tenacity against gragas is not useless
[0:40:04] NothHellNoaKnight: @catJAMenjoyer that's why he called impregnator
[0:40:07] lolkotek: his sustain is crazy
[0:40:11] AntcliffLIVE: the 2nd half of gragas e is a mini stun chat
[0:40:15] AntcliffLIVE: tenacity reduces the duration of it
[0:40:23] catJAMenjoyer: oh ok
[0:40:47] imeepyy: what a stupid fucking champ OMEGALUL
[0:40:57] dany_falcon: nice trolling
[0:40:58] dany_falcon: LUL
[0:41:08] Amaresu_: oh no gragas ban again huh
[0:41:12] Amaresu_: guess we cant play the game gg
[0:41:15] flokillo123: what is this fat gragas
[0:41:17] ismashedd: Merc first tho oO
[0:41:22] NothHellNoaKnight: atleast fiora is skill matchup
[0:41:22] Amaresu_: how is he down cs OMEGALUL
[0:41:25] hyper_camm: forbidden chapter purchased, he now has infinite mana
[0:41:27] Deviant_Blade: is like u have a mental block with gragas @Viper
[0:41:28] Aarguil: gragas is disgusting
[0:41:29] lolkotek: vipeThump
[0:41:29] NothHellNoaKnight: gragas is just pig matchup
[0:41:40] Kylon1235: Team will carry Hopium
[0:41:51] Amaresu_: @Deviant_Blade no the champ just neutralizes all melee carries, even irelia
[0:42:02] Amaresu_: you know a champ is thanos if he beats jax.
[0:42:13] herculesirl: + karma + zac
[0:42:16] catJAMenjoyer: Look how long that slow duration is even with mercs @antclifflive
[0:42:17] ゴミ: wp!
[0:42:18] Amaresu_: buffed while being s+ tier and seraphs gets buffed next patch as well ggbenq
[0:42:21] Feymid: that looked fun
[0:42:22] TheFrequency: good lord that was clean
[0:42:23] NothHellNoaKnight: i'd say too much people are playing him rn
[0:42:23] sabishii99: 1 to 10 how playable riven is on mid
[0:42:28] Kub4z1: what runes does he playing?
[0:42:28] hyper_camm: Its the highest WR mid lane champ with the lich bane build
[0:42:29] LoLRankBot: Current Runes: Conqueror > Triumph > Legend: Tenacity > Last Stand | Nimbus Cloak > Transcendence | Adaptive Force > Adaptive Force > Health Scaling
[0:42:29] NothHellNoaKnight: like people have no dignity at all
[0:42:30] catJAMenjoyer: @antclifflive imo u just build dmg and try to 1 shot him
[0:42:34] AntcliffLIVE: @catJAMenjoyer wdym slow? his q slow?
[0:42:39] looper2121: sup cutie
[0:42:45] catJAMenjoyer: @antclifflive yeah
[0:42:48] TBJ_123: That was so clean
[0:42:48] raitskii03: They nerfed it but still too stupid
[0:42:51] waitdontshootme: literally unplayable
[0:43:00] Amaresu_: honestly, this matchup is ravenous rush unironically.
[0:43:01] AntcliffLIVE: tenacity doesnt reduce the effectiveness of slows just the duration
[0:43:12] catJAMenjoyer: thats what I said
[0:43:14] catJAMenjoyer: ?
[0:43:31] AntcliffLIVE: u said tenacity against gragas is useless
[0:43:39] catJAMenjoyer: its kinda* useless
[0:43:40] Amaresu_: his E stuns btw
[0:43:43] waitdontshootme: not even worth against his E?
[0:43:48] catJAMenjoyer: since his slows are still very long
[0:43:53] AntcliffLIVE: his E is a stun
[0:44:08] Amaresu_: xd
[0:44:10] catJAMenjoyer: ok boss
[0:44:13] Amaresu_: toplane moment
[0:44:19] AntcliffLIVE: xdd ?
[0:44:19] Mekkelmore: and his wave crashes all g
[0:44:35] Amaresu_: this IS good, but 3-0 lucian has to carry
[0:44:36] Deviant_Blade: @Amaresu_  I've known Viper for about 9 years, I think I know the difference between one thing and another. but ye gragas is rly hard
[0:44:38] Amaresu_: and lucian is not guma
[0:44:39] Amaresu_: so..
[0:45:11] Amaresu_: viper doesnt have a mental block against any single champ. he just gets bored when ppl pick shit that doesnt interact
[0:45:14] Amaresu_: and gragas doesnt interact
[0:45:21] catJAMenjoyer: who doesnt
[0:45:39] Amaresu_: idk apparently most ppl dont play this game to have fun or make plays or fight or go for kills
[0:45:41] Bamslol: @Viper i feel the lethality build just gets 1 tapped by grag 2item
[0:45:45] austn00: that ult was personal
[0:45:54] Amaresu_: they play tank enchanter mage adc and have sub 10cspm and build like shit and wonder why they lost xd
[0:45:59] waitdontshootme: feels like he always has his ult
[0:46:06] nag3l: Can't fight Gragas, E OP
[0:46:07] Deviant_Blade: @Amaresu_ ye he does xD what are u his mother irl or something

[0:47:14] Lugury: good for your team tho
[0:47:36] catJAMenjoyer: the most broken champ in the game rn is Seraphine imo, her W is an AOE shield, and in mid to late she just gives her whole team 800 hp shields every 6 seconds
[0:47:49] catJAMenjoyer: thats extremely unhealthy for the gamw
[0:47:58] Amaresu_: i mean azir exists but not wrong
[0:48:35] catJAMenjoyer: at least Azir is hard to play
[0:48:42] catJAMenjoyer: he is very mechanically intensive
[0:49:02] catJAMenjoyer: while seraphine is press Q press W win the game
