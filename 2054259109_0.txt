[2:35:41] ProphetITA: I hate yone because he is piss easy. My proof? I play aram. I typically play with my friends as a five stack. Whenever someone of us gets yone(which thankfully none of us plays him in normal SR games), we stack his q3, and immediately the one who got yone says " im going to yone moment". He proceeds to e into r into q3( mostly missing everyone except one unlucky guy), gets at least 2 kills while missing almost anything, and then gets back before the enemy has a chance to answer.

[3:21:53] HeiressOfRuin: isn't stormsurge useless now
[3:22:01] HeiressOfRuin: why go stormsurge instead of zhonya when zhonya has 120 ap now
[3:22:03] buffadc21: asoul got no tower dmdg
[3:22:14] MistaShiny: idk maybe STORMSURGE
[3:22:17] 21_march: whole team besides maokai shitting the bed
[3:22:18] MistaShiny: is a completely different item
[3:22:19] nxtrl: if i play a game of league of legends and lose can i blame you @MistaShiny
[3:22:20] MistaShiny: than zonhya
[3:22:36] Slperyknob: If you use an AHK script to change the league clients opacity can you get banned for it?
[3:22:47] 21_march: smolder scaled o7
[3:22:50] xsooni: @Slperyknob why would u ever do that
[3:22:55] HeiressOfRuin: @MistaShiny What?
[3:22:56] buffadc21: @HeiressOfRuin cause of stormsurge passive i guess
[3:22:58] Slperyknob: Looks
[3:23:06] MistaShiny: LETSFO
[3:23:07] frantic4skin: beast
[3:23:09] MistaShiny: LETSFUCKINGMEOW
[3:23:09] HeiressOfRuin: Yeah, stormsurge passive isn't good anymore
[3:23:10] OhKyuur: OKAAAAAY
[3:23:11] HeiressOfRuin: really
[3:23:14] HeiressOfRuin: after all the nerfs
[3:23:21] HeiressOfRuin: It's a bad item now
[3:23:27] MistaShiny: comparing these items dont make sense
[3:23:32] MistaShiny: when they are nto mean for the same thing
[3:23:36] buffadc21: that item was way too op
[3:23:37] HeiressOfRuin: I know?
[3:23:42] eljuanic27: guys playing yone vs fiora what should i build
[3:23:49] Slperyknob: @xsooni why not?
[3:23:56] HeiressOfRuin: But zhonya is way more valuable than stormsurge on neeko, and it gives more ap and likely even just more damage at this point
[3:24:01] HeiressOfRuin: Well, maybe not more damage
[3:24:06] HeiressOfRuin: But it's certainly a lot better
[3:24:13] Sandkitt: chat is so boring today... dzuBored
[3:24:25] buffadc21: it may be cluless neeko who knows
[3:24:26] HeiressOfRuin: Like, I'm not comparing the items
[3:24:43] MistaShiny: you are not necessarly wrong but if neeko wanted more dmg she wanted to buy stormsurge now did she need more dmg or not i dont play mages
[3:24:44] HeiressOfRuin: But zhonya is absolutely better than stormsurge here, and likely better in a majority of scenarios
[3:24:44] MistaShiny: smile
[3:25:16] HeiressOfRuin: Yeah, but neeko damage is pretty team focused after laning, and stormsurge only procs on one person (at least from what I tested, but I could have tested it wrong)
[3:25:17] MistaShiny: they are triple AP so i guess she wanted to be useful with dmg
[3:25:30] eljuanic27: guysssss pls help what should i build vs fiora playing yone
[3:25:31] HeiressOfRuin: Yeah
[3:25:39] frantic4skin: kraken
[3:25:45] buffadc21: spritie visage last item ?
[3:25:48] eljuanic27: kraken?
[3:25:53] HeiressOfRuin: Zhonya active and the fact that it has like 30 more ap probably means more damage in the long term than a storm surge is all
[3:25:56] uncle_mo65: @eljuanic27 kraken into shieldbow
[3:26:10] eljuanic27: thx
[3:26:15] MistaShiny: i do think going stormsurge and protobelt
[3:26:17] MistaShiny: is too weird
[3:26:21] MistaShiny: you dont need both
[3:26:26] HeiressOfRuin: Yeah
[3:26:36] HeiressOfRuin: And unless rocketbelt got a buff lately it's damage is pretty lacking too
[3:27:10] frantic4skin: the dash is hi value on keko
[3:27:11] HeiressOfRuin: So you're both not having damage for a little utility, and have an item that doesn't give you much damage and doesn't let you use your cc very well
