[0:16:17] KaiGoesMoo: People don't realize a chaingun will rip apart all the optics on ANY tank in seconds if it's close enough, making it useless
[0:16:30] DirtyPotato: i mean the bradleys are designed to be an APC and tank killer
[0:16:35] thatluckyloser: like some silly wunderwaffen
[0:16:36] iAlike: @blackb1rd20 And was only a mission kill but point still stands

[0:33:27] Swiftfool: @lawlman the button underneath the pin on the far right simplifies the stats
[0:33:34] Jman1606: BTW you can bring multiple units in the same vehicle. If a squad is small enough you can bring in like IGLA boys with the VDV teams

[0:46:04] Horusoo: monkaS
[0:46:05] Segurr: Clap
[0:46:09] skycaptain_: Clap
[0:46:10] thatluckyloser: those dudes died
[0:46:11] ThatCrazyHawk: LUL
[0:46:27] Jman1606: AMRAAM from their Hornets
[0:46:39] ugebuge: arew your troops down or
[0:46:43] ThatCrazyHawk: US air power is scawwy
[0:46:44] MozzArelIa: planes be doin plane shit
[0:46:44] thatluckyloser: I feel like those buildings hold way more than 40
[0:47:00] dezztroy: Yo I was hoping you'd play this Pog
[0:47:03] Jman1606: ye
[0:47:12] dezztroy: Yeah the transport system is dope in this game
[0:47:17] Jman1606: So long as the transport is in the deck you can use it with any unit
[0:47:23] Mag_Lev: So, Broken arrow is more like a modern Steel Division?
[0:47:26] dezztroy: Can even do stuff like mix infantry and supplies in the same transport
[0:47:31] skycaptain_: @Mag_Lev Ye
[0:47:32] thatluckyloser: yes
[0:47:36] blackb1rd20: yeah thats part of why iI love this game . So much potential
[0:47:46] Mag_Lev: Neat, it looks cool.
[0:47:59] Segurr: monkaSTEER
[0:48:03] Levodoom: imagine if the trees fucked it up
[0:48:05] Harry_DuBois_: Yo, Broken Arrow! I've been playing so much of the beta
[0:48:07] Jman1606: @Mag_Lev Kind of... Its got a bit more separation from Wargrame or Steel Division to make it unique enough but very much same vein
[0:48:08] Segurr: lotta trees here boss monkaSTEER
[0:48:09] Mag_Lev: It is like Lawlman landing during a Vietnam mission PepeHands
[0:48:27] KaiGoesMoo: How differently does this play compared to WARNO?
[0:48:52] blackb1rd20: goon squad rolling in
[0:48:53] thatluckyloser: are we winning?
[0:48:53] Heasimitore: give me this but 40k
[0:48:55] Segurr: this seems more granular than warno
[0:48:55] Jman1606: Units aren't "dead" if they die. They will be re added to your deck after a period of time
[0:48:57] Mintaur: you can tell your transports to just RTB
[0:49:03] Mag_Lev: Dare them to walk up to your block
[0:49:07] Jman1606: @Mintaur And you get refunded the points
[0:49:08] MozzArelIa: are those teams of guys each or are you just sending single guys into those buildings?
[0:49:10] dezztroy: In case you don't know, you can select a group and then hit tab to cycle through single units in the group, makes spreading infantry out really easy
[0:49:43] Mag_Lev: That whole block is a hell of firing cover.
[0:49:52] Jman1606: nyoooom
[0:49:53] skycaptain_: Its nice because your troops dont die permanently they regen over time if killed
[0:50:03] Jman1606: rip
[0:50:05] Segurr: monkaS
[0:50:07] thatluckyloser: did they survive?
[0:50:28] Jman1606: I've seen TU-160's level entire city blocks. Its insane
[0:50:34] Jman1606: monkaS
[0:50:40] Segurr: with a kord idk
[0:50:41] blackb1rd20: oh be careful, if a building is destroyed everything in it dies
[0:50:47] dezztroy: I love the supply system in this game, it's so satisfying when you nail an ammo dump the enemy artillery is sitting at
[0:51:01] MozzArelIa: missle dudes need in the high rise still
[0:51:01] Moobot: Use Code 'LAWL' for 10% off your GamerSupps! or Click Here: https://gamersupps.gg/LAWL
[0:51:02] Mag_Lev: Oh cool, the heli can flare.
[0:51:11] Segurr: osprey will crash on its own dw
[0:51:24] Jman1606: Flares are manual too not just for flavor
[0:51:27] KaiGoesMoo: Wokege
[0:51:30] RobertLuvsGames: WAHHHHTTT?
[0:51:30] blackb1rd20: @Segurr sad KEKW
[0:51:33] beffychinchilla: Wokege
[0:51:35] Goobydewby: TheVoices
[0:51:35] HerbaceousTea: eeeeeeeeeeeee
[0:51:39] Segurr: @Segurr ikr
[0:51:45] Fr0stWulf: WAYTOODANK
[0:51:49] Horusoo: so this is basicly Steel division 2 in modern era ?
[0:51:56] RobertLuvsGames: My immersion
[0:52:04] Segurr: you can turn radar off to avoid SEAD i think
[0:52:05] dezztroy: Steel Division is Wargame in WW2
[0:52:07] Horusoo: looks very similar im guessing same studio ?
[0:52:08] Jman1606: issa SAM
[0:52:17] Jman1606: Not same studio
[0:52:18] Finnester: @Horusoo like a knock off wargame
[0:52:24] Swiftfool: Do you know the Hotkeys? @Lawlman Q to attack/attack move, U to unload, T for ground fire, P for precision strike, Z for Run, X for smokes
[0:52:25] Horusoo: Hoooo
[0:52:26] Harry_DuBois_: The dynamic tracking is really fun
[0:52:31] Darchon_: did you not see the bradley vs t90 clip monkaS
[0:52:38] Horusoo: thank you
[0:52:47] Jman1606: I think this is one of slitherine's studios and they are basically the guys who make... like all RTS's for now LUL

[0:52:52] blackb1rd20: t90 vs brads . Nothing bad could happen :)
[0:53:00] jaxkmurphy: nice
[0:53:01] dezztroy: Loading up like 70 dudes in the plane and paradropping them all is sick
[0:53:09] dezztroy: (until it gets shot down and you lose everyone inside)
[0:53:12] thatluckyloser: do people still paradrop?
[0:53:16] Mintaur: your kornets are ready to garrison
[0:53:41] Harry_DuBois_: @thatluckyloser oh yeah. Gotta have complete air superiority though
[0:54:01] thatluckyloser: how do you know if you have low ammo
[0:54:17] Harry_DuBois_: I wish you could send troops in with more ammo for supply. Like the AA launchers only get three shots before they have to run to a supply dump.
[0:54:17] blackb1rd20: a little symbol pops up by the unit
[0:54:17] dezztroy: Yeah this is a really fresh take on the Wargame formula, it's good that Eugen finally has some competition
[0:54:54] Jman1606: clusters kinda monkaS
[0:55:14] dezztroy: US rocket artillery is spooky, very strong
[0:55:16] Swiftfool: Do you know the Hotkeys? @Lawlman Q to attack/attack move, U to unload, B for return to Base, T for ground fire, P for precision strike, Z for Run, X for smokes
[0:55:37] dezztroy: Also V to fly low, helps avoid AA
[0:56:13] Swiftfool: and hold down alt to see LOS
[0:56:13] Moobot: Merch is live! Check out all the cool stuff at https://lawlman.com/
[0:56:15] Jman1606: iss aPOOSH
[0:56:28] jaxkmurphy: front line shifting from west to east to north to south LUL
[0:56:34] thatluckyloser: can they go around you?
[0:56:43] jaxkmurphy: big bomb ?
[0:56:46] blackb1rd20: drops all my jdams on you
[0:56:48] Swiftfool: Wait until they start HIMARs and MLRS all those skyscrapers
[0:56:59] Mag_Lev: He destroyed the truck LUL
[0:57:05] thatluckyloser: jdams are such a gemini thing
[0:57:15] MozzArelIa: @Swiftfool would be VERY unfortunate
[0:57:26] MozzArelIa: but at the same time, having the area that defended is funny
[0:57:28] Mintaur: he's all out of big missile
[0:58:01] dezztroy: Mi-26 is good for making beeg supply dumps
[0:58:11] thatluckyloser: we did have to
[0:58:13] thatluckyloser: double tap
[0:58:17] Swiftfool: here comes the MLRS
[0:58:18] Mintaur: oof the himars
[0:58:40] dezztroy: They're only using cluster rockets so far, they don't do much to buildings thankfully
[0:59:02] Mag_Lev: They definitely want both
[0:59:03] Jman1606: Clusters are kinda big smelly
[0:59:26] Jman1606: Like if those were mostly unarmored vehicles it'd be bad
[0:59:31] Mintaur: those tanks might do some work here
[0:59:52] dezztroy: 2010s rocket artillery vs ancient soviet 60s artillery
[0:59:57] Harry_DuBois_: For the same reason Russia has T-14's.
[1:00:03] Jman1606: rip
[1:00:04] Swiftfool: @Lawlman Need to use the MLRS for long range ground missiles
[1:00:06] Mintaur: NOOO
[1:00:47] dezztroy: Russia doesn't have long range artillery in the beta
[1:00:47] Jman1606: LETSGO
[1:00:55] MozzArelIa: dammmm
[1:00:56] Mag_Lev: Well, there goes their arty LUL
[1:00:59] Darchon_: grad is mlrs, no?
[1:01:02] Swiftfool: They do have long range arty im sure
[1:01:11] blackb1rd20: dont arty when you got cruise missiles
[1:01:11] Moobot: Broke is prepared to drag anyone into the Detroit Salt Mines, founded 1921™®. So chill and have a non-branded cola drink, on Broke.

[1:01:27] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[1:01:42] dezztroy: Grad doesn't have smoke ammo
[1:01:49] dezztroy: Only howitzers and mortars get smoke
[1:01:57] MozzArelIa: they paradroped it OMEGALUL
[1:01:57] Harry_DuBois_: @Swiftfool Longest range is 4500 or something vs 6000 on us prsm
[1:02:04] Jman1606: I think he only has HE rn
[1:02:08] thatluckyloser: union break
[1:02:11] Mintaur: but it dont got the ammo ammo
[1:02:31] Harry_DuBois_: Yeah, the ammo options are static for every unit, but if they don't have the ammo the fire plan won't execute
[1:03:06] Jman1606: POOOOSH
[1:03:06] Moobot: Don't forget to drink water, especially you @lawlman! >:(
[1:03:23] dezztroy: Russia does have tons of mortar carriers available, they're pretty solid too

[1:04:23] iAlike: Now we hit them with da BIG bomb
[1:04:30] Mag_Lev: Our control point now
[1:04:42] dezztroy: Surely there won't be a counter attack Clueless
[1:04:44] Swiftfool: I mainly use the TOS1 Soints... for Russian Arty
[1:05:00] Jman1606: That went so crazy
[1:05:08] bearonvonbear: bearonvonbear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Trainge
[1:05:19] dezztroy: The Buratino felt kinda shit to me, unfortunate since it's so fun in Wargame
[1:05:24] Segurr: poggSpin
[1:05:29] thatluckyloser: gonna get shot down
[1:05:31] Swiftfool: V3 trophy is expensive

[1:05:57] Segurr: BOOM
[1:05:58] ballistic9: Holy
[1:06:02] Jman1606: No cover for you LUL
[1:06:04] volution: nice
[1:06:15] Harry_DuBois_: How do the americans not have patriots set up?
[1:06:35] MozzArelIa: man lawlman is doing great, imagine what the real russian army can surely accomplish if even a complete beginner can do this :)
[1:06:35] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq

[1:06:43] Mag_Lev: Another 2 M1A2 monkaS
[1:07:20] Jman1606: scammed
[1:07:21] dezztroy: Have to set barrage duration to long if you want it to fire everything
[1:07:29] thatluckyloser: I don't think their recruiter told them about this
[1:07:31] Harry_DuBois_: That unit is so nasty for being infantry
[1:07:53] barbadosblackbelly: Looking
[1:08:16] Swiftfool: @Lawlman move him to a supply area he'll heal
[1:08:16] Jman1606: Nawh take too long
[1:08:22] Harry_DuBois_: Nah, set up up supply points to replenish
[1:08:25] thatluckyloser: they just gonna walk
[1:08:25] Jman1606: Supplies is the way to go I believe
[1:08:30] HerbaceousTea: One less letter to the family you have to write NODDERS
[1:08:32] Mintaur: it will take them a decade to fully RTB
[1:08:36] dezztroy: Yeah infantry heal like Wargame, not Steel Division
[1:08:37] k3rm1t_da_fr4g: let them die for the motherland
[1:08:42] Swiftfool: Also you can pick him up in a transport or airdrop supply to him
[1:09:13] Mag_Lev: They've lost a lot of ground on that west island now
[1:10:07] Jman1606: if this works I swear
[1:10:12] Jman1606: I'm about to Pog
[1:10:13] Mag_Lev: Dropping in the Spetsnaz monkaS
[1:10:25] thatluckyloser: so this is gonna crash and burn right?
[1:10:41] IllusiveGay: I thought all the VDV died?
[1:10:48] Mintaur: no shot they have a patriot missile
[1:10:49] ValkyrianSkuld: Use the crossing? it's so close

[1:13:40] canner7: they tried that on Kiev's airport I think lol
[1:13:40] dezztroy: It's an apartment block instead of an airfield, and it worked instead of them all getting mowed down
[1:13:40] Mintaur: time to big bomb everyone
[1:13:42] volution: @Saryn0228 cold garbage

[1:14:00] thatluckyloser: destruction to loss
[1:14:03] bearonvonbear: wikked He's got that DL
[1:14:05] dezztroy: Destruction/Losses ratio
[1:14:05] Swiftfool: Destruction to Loss
[1:14:07] canner7: that was crazy
[1:14:32] Jman1606: US will be able too in the full game
[1:14:34] Harry_DuBois_: They can
[1:14:35] Swiftfool: @Lawlman They can paradrop but not some units
[1:14:35] Jman1606: Just not right now.
[1:14:36] Mintaur: my damage to loss ratio is crazy low
[1:14:39] thatluckyloser: what can the americans do
[1:14:44] dezztroy: The US can paradrop, the marine raiders can paradrop and they're the best infantry in the beta
[1:14:44] Mintaur: normally
[1:14:59] Segurr: moto boys are like basic mobile infantry
[1:15:09] Jman1606: Marine raiders are epic
[1:15:15] Harry_DuBois_: With the hawk, yeah
[1:15:23] mattband: no one ever expect attacks from the air.
[1:15:38] Jman1606: There will be a AC130 in the full game :)
[1:15:41] Mintaur: this one gets bombs tho
[1:15:44] Segurr: omg the missiles
[1:15:49] Swiftfool: One is probably more than enough imo
[1:15:56] Mag_Lev: The F-35 monkaS
[1:16:05] Justamandood: big planea pogg
[1:16:21] dezztroy: Hornets with 4x 2000lbs bombs is really good too
[1:16:30] Segurr: manys harms here brother
[1:16:31] Swiftfool: so SEAD shoots missiles at any air defenses the enemy has that has its Radar on @Lawlman
[1:16:45] Jman1606: 2 HARM 2 ECM?
[1:16:50] Jman1606: oh we're poor nvm
[1:16:50] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[1:17:32] dezztroy: F-35 comes with AMRAAMs built in, might be cheaper
[1:17:33] Iskierka2: No A-10? Madge
[1:17:39] kingsableye: Is this made by the same Devs as Steel Division 2?
[1:17:44] Jman1606: No
[1:18:11] Broke99: Oh hey kings
[1:18:38] Jman1606: F35 also has built in ECM too
[1:18:42] Darchon_: KKona F35 can 1vRussia
[1:19:03] HerbaceousTea: But the important question, can the F-35B enter VTOL mode to t-bag the wreckage of enemy jets?
[1:19:11] Swiftfool: @Lawlman Nope
[1:19:12] kingsableye: No AWACs Sadge
[1:19:16] NoSweetOnlySalty: Shruge
[1:19:17] Jman1606: It has a tag on the card in the top right
[1:19:18] dezztroy: Only Marine Raiders and Force Recon
[1:19:19] kingsableye: @Broke99 rubyfaWAVE Hi Broke
[1:19:20] Harry_DuBois_: No, the portrait will have a parachute if it can
[1:19:21] dezztroy: And Snipers
[1:19:21] ValkyrianSkuld: Parachute symbol
[1:19:42] Swiftfool: Marine Radars are super strong
[1:19:45] Tasaab: I wish there was a 40k version of this game
[1:19:46] ValkyrianSkuld: Check trucks
[1:19:46] Swiftfool: @Lawlman Recon has units
[1:19:53] ValkyrianSkuld: bradleys maybe
[1:19:54] Jman1606: ForCon is good too
[1:20:02] Segurr: recon POGGERS
[1:20:02] Harry_DuBois_: There are some vehicles can too
[1:20:06] Jman1606: Scout snipers too I think?
[1:20:11] Mag_Lev: I mean, dropping in 10 people is insane.
[1:20:12] Swiftfool: and yeah some vehicles can as well
[1:20:14] spooky_sushi: units die super fast in this game too
[1:20:23] IntrepidEye: I think you can airdrop LAVs too
[1:20:32] bandit0424: @Tasaab would be fun esp. with some kind of campaign (the Total War is kinda close but personally not a fan of the campaign map stuff in those)
[1:20:46] dezztroy: It's not as many troops, but marine raiders are way better than VDV
[1:20:57] Jman1606: Once the full game comes out you should be able to Air deploy with like the 101st and 82nd once Airborne specializations are available for the US @Lawlman
[1:21:02] kingsableye: Weird the US doesn't have the Airborne, I guess it's just because it's beta
[1:21:15] Segurr: ????
[1:21:15] Moobot: Roc is here for two things and two things only. Your channel points, and soul.
