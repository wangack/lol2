[1:33:29] Klony99: @chaoticfox07 The issue is that he makes you think the world hates men to sell you a cure. It doesn't. The world, at large, doesn't give a fuck.

[1:34:29] Selene_Flore: @chaoticfox07 we're talking about the same man that says women should be responsible when they get sexually assaulted? Are you okay?
[1:34:29] KaptinSkorge: Tate isn't positive. He teaches you to be proud of being a horrible person. That's not positive for the world, it's selfish
[1:34:31] gunner62: nah what the fuck did i just pop into

[1:38:51] THGKUNGEN: ❤️
[1:38:53] Klony99: @chaoticfox07 I prefer something stronger, but I don't mind sitting down with someone I disagree with. Though I would mercilessly mock you for defending a man such as Andrew Tate.
[1:38:55] Elwendir: @packo909 that's true, but it use the usual stratagems of manipulative people: saying a few truths in a sea of lies
[1:38:55] bigbrother0012: tbh nothing we do matters we all will die
[1:38:58] adwermaire: inspiring taco, need more men like u
[1:38:58] KaptinSkorge: how is someone gonna call you a narcissist while stanning Tate
[1:39:02] moe_9998: aight
[1:39:05] NapNapoleon: I mean, that's the danger with con artists. They'll say a truth and a lie, and make you think the lie is the truth too. Andrew is a complete con artist.
[1:39:15] rexol1234: deadass just be nice to others and youre good as a person lmfao
[1:39:16] Skurai21: trying to defend Tate by calling someone else a narcissist LUL
[1:39:27] RescueCPR: >defending tate

[1:39:54] rexol1234: idk like i get it why people think that way but if how many ppl u slept with you they just look so sad and insecure
[1:39:58] Official_Owo: @4swordsknight NO WAY ARE WE DEFENDING HITLER IN 2024
[1:40:00] G04Tzilla: @IKeepItTaco does your portrait tap the keys when you are putting  in passwords xD
[1:40:07] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Tate is cringe
[1:40:13] rexol1234: @SaltedIIIBlueberries worse than that
[1:40:16] bigbrother0012: why are we talking about hitler bro
[1:40:21] chaoticfox07: @Klony99 You honestly could say whatever you want about me. Cus as a MAN, I literally dont care what people think about me. BEat quote, "Lions dont care about he opinions of Sheep" Plus its never constructive to mock people. It shows youre character which isnt good
[1:40:23] packo909: Ive never said that tate was a good person, just some aevices are helpful for these days
[1:40:24] IR1SHRAGE: @Official_Owo my guy, it doesnt matter what time it is, their will always be idiots
[1:40:38] NapNapoleon: Yup. That's the BnB of persuasion, con artists and trickery. Lies in truth. Truth in lies.
[1:40:39] rexol1234: @SaltedIIIBlueberries like he straight up managed to make a whole wave of kids who are just weird dangerous people

[1:40:53] Untitlelied: I’m too scared to ask who are they talking about but maybe I don’t want to know HahaSweat
[1:40:55] Klony99: @thestarforgerotp Just deduction. He's in Grandmaster now so the base of people is thin, and they insta requeued most likely. So he just waits until they should be in a game.

[1:41:44] Klony99: @chaoticfox07 I am not a sheep, so you're trying to insult me. There goes the beer. And if you never listen to people you think are beneath you you will miss valuable feedback. I listen to everything people say. I don't act on everything I hear though.
[1:41:51] chaoticfox07: @IKeepItTaco Taco, I still love yah man, even tho we dont see eye to eye about that subject, you are a light in the league community

[1:42:43] moonlunefj: American football and football
[1:42:44] TopKeks_senpai123: I thought taco was EU

[1:44:05] Klony99: @chaoticfox07 You said I can say whatever you want because you don't care about the opinion of sheep. :D Or worse, you said you don't care about what ANY people say about you. Which is why I said you're missing valuable feedback.
[1:44:05] G04Tzilla: @IR1SHRAGE did you watch 6 nations the other day?
[1:44:12] Official_Owo: Can you be a frog oil salesman?

[1:46:24] chaoticfox07: @Klony99 Sir you are literally being way too literal. If you feel like I called you sometihng thats on you. Also when someone says they dont care about what people say about them, its more or less about negativity or hurtful things, criticisms, not constructive critcism. You are just litearlly trying to find something wrong with what I said. SAd

[1:52:27] NapNapoleon: It would actually count as a placement of product. Which has its very specific rules.
[1:52:31] pinguino_sensei: taco sounds richer with these ads
[1:52:32] P4hagen: @mcegginton yup!
[1:52:33] bigbrother0012: an other ad this is insane

[1:54:52] lwfwarrior: @wonderfulturtle wtf kind of car do you have
[1:54:53] KayXOTV: like box water
[1:54:55] Klony99: @zathura6 I swear if I didn't order stuff regularly I'd cancel my prime sub immediately. The games are shit anyways, it's usually just a purple hat or a trash game nobody wants to play.
[1:54:58] RefiixGaming: Or is it cheap?
[1:55:02] bigbrother0012: i drink water

[1:56:42] Midjenko: Abdul come closer
[1:56:43] Franioo: Klony, in the big cities ppl like to flex their money imho

[1:57:41] lwfwarrior: normies spamming pepsi light nowadays
[1:57:43] lwfwarrior: ruins the game
[1:57:51] Klony99: @IKeepItTaco Pepsi is only cool because it's the soda brand with the coolest video game ever.
[1:57:53] mcegginton: Pepsi max abusers are the worst
[1:58:01] bigbrother0012: america soda drinks are diff from eu
[1:58:09] moe_9998: whats pepsi max

[1:59:01] maw_of_malmortius: wait, it's rango and the roach
[1:59:03] SwiftyCalico: :0  he said it
[1:59:08] Klony99: @KayXOTV Direct sugar from sodas is actually more harmful than the sauce on a burger. Burgers itself aren't really unhealthy, just the amount. I hate this arguement because as a diabetic, I can really, REALLY not afford the quick sugar a non-diet coke delivers. It makes a HUGE difference.
[1:59:12] moe_9998: LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:59:15] SwiftyCalico: plink

[1:59:32] bigbrother0012: or was that his real voice?
[1:59:32] NapNapoleon: Hey. Look. There's a lot of dopamine obtained from pressing all your buttons and deleting someone instantly. That insane dopamine destroyed their brains. Please understand.
[1:59:32] Klony99: @moe_9998 "Zero" is NO sugar and 0 calories, so it's "special", but yes, diet coke but Pepsi.
[1:59:41] xGippinx: wHy ArE u InSeCuRe
[1:59:41] Klony99: @IKeepItTaco Do you know about the Pepsi video game though?

[2:00:20] KayXOTV: @Klony99 obviously it make sense if you diabetes, but i mean genrally they eat alot of sugar added food and get diet sodas
[2:00:23] wwaterbearer: @Elwendir i fucking live for this. Hold pink wards and scanning trinket for them.
[2:00:35] wwaterbearer: twitch and rengars HATE pink wards (:

[2:02:37] siekiernik_pl: Ornn run out of patience i gues.
[2:02:40] Xdelahozx: @Elwendir yep
[2:02:41] Klony99: @Elwendir NGL a team that knows how to use vision gets so much value from a single ward that the entire WCS is played around removing them. They even send 3 player teams to objectives to secure vision advantage. Of course in Silver or something it doesn't matter, nobody looks anyways.
[2:02:57] peshecito: SMILERS
[2:03:08] bigbrother0012: let him cook
[2:03:14] yaseruuu: That 1 kill is all he needs i think
[2:03:26] KayXOTV: pink wards in solo ranked and pinks in esport is 2 diffrent worlds
[2:03:34] KayXOTV: in solo mostly not worth the gold
[2:03:38] Elwendir: @Klony99 that's correct for pro play, but not in my elo hell of dia, i would rather have my second and thrid item a few minutes earlier as supp items are cheap
[2:03:48] NapNapoleon: Flashing right on the middle.
[2:03:53] 200yearsZed_ismyvibe: always gank them back
[2:03:53] mcegginton: @Elwendir This is why I play Renata because she's an enchanter that builds tank items anyway
[2:03:54] KayXOTV: especially on item depended supports
[2:03:54] Klony99: @KayXOTV That is not true for GM+ games. They matter a lot in BRoxahs games for example.
[2:03:57] lwfwarrior: cannot believe taco called sona a bitch when he is part of the women respecters subreddit
[2:03:59] JactBoyo: okay that R predict was kinda insane

[2:04:44] CictorGabriel: EZ Clap
[2:04:58] laikanangel: Is it just just me or is this Kha'zix FRESH AF
[2:05:04] Klony99: @KayXOTV That's probably because the rest of the team does? Does he buy the ward item for more eyes though?
[2:05:07] Elwendir: @Klony99 ye but supp should not be the one buying pinks as they have access to less gold and have hyper efficient items (especially enchanters) imo

[2:10:08] ChaosHK: The dive would've been fine if we wated for Liss before we bard the tower
[2:10:42] Klony99: @ChaosHK Kha's presence alone would've meant he had to hog his minions which would result in Taco doing more damage.

[2:17:04] mcegginton: This Hwei is fucking nuts
[2:17:32] Ricnikrab: seems like outside laning phase smolder is not a champ if he doesnt have 225stacks
[2:18:02] CictorGabriel: @fiercuh he is not indeed
[2:18:15] merengreg: hes outclassed as an adc and just lacks the juice to be an ad caster like Ezreal
[2:18:24] hambone_cam: MOMMMMMM
[2:18:35] Official_Owo: full stacks mooferCheer
[2:18:35] Klony99: The voice line doesn'T trigger so Taco does it himself. What a leegend.
[2:18:47] konungr___: I feel like he is a better midlaner than adc would yall agree
[2:19:24] RefiixGaming: You
[2:19:28] RefiixGaming: Deal
[2:19:36] RefiixGaming: Zero dmg
[2:19:40] Psychomatosis: looks like it doesn't do much dmg
[2:19:43] NapNapoleon: rengr
[2:19:45] merengreg: Average smolder experience
[2:20:08] RefiixGaming: It's painful I wish you'd melt him
[2:20:12] redseal16: Looking
[2:20:16] Shiibbae: he woulda killed yas if orne didnt knock up tbf
[2:20:32] leafy_beefy: he is smolding
[2:20:41] ArrowQuiver: how does muramana interact with smolder Q? does it only proc on the initial hit or does the burn proc as well?

[2:21:41] Elwendir: i would have too LUL
[2:21:43] peshecito: And Sona keeps them alive too, but you are hurting ikeepitRAREOK
[2:21:44] siekiernik_pl: Ornn is mocking your "damage"
[2:21:56] Elwendir: sona sera is so much healing
[2:22:09] xGippinx: tank does too much dmg
[2:22:10] Desiratus: Is ornn worth armor shred or do you just ignore him here?
[2:22:33] laikanangel: @siekiernik_pl Ornn be like: ""damage"? That's a funny way to spell healing"
[2:22:36] RefiixGaming: Maybe it just feels like the dam is lackluster because top usually not as rich as adc
[2:22:39] merengreg: i also think that the W skill and R are needing some numbers, they feel quite weak
[2:22:51] kaiserwroth: Just outheal the damage Clueless
[2:23:02] Shiibbae: and ornn can make everyone tankier with upgraded items
[2:23:09] redseal16: ive watched sunlight play top smolder he rushes shojin into cleaver jaksho then build goes from there
[2:23:28] itshaidary: u prefer the navori or trio force smolder build ?
[2:23:32] itshaidary: which*
[2:23:58] merengreg: maybe  triforce into BC and hullbreaker might make it quite usable before it hits the 225 powerspike
[2:24:03] Lazynameross: wwd mom Smoge
[2:24:19] gunner62: interesting
[2:24:26] mcegginton: taco trolling
[2:24:30] itshaidary: sera shields are just so broken
[2:24:33] Dash728: runnin it down
[2:24:41] sheluxpretty: this champion is worthless

[2:24:42] AlTreacle: serpants here?
[2:24:48] gunner62: not trolling xdd
[2:24:54] peshecito: yeah, thinking serpents too
[2:24:55] WhiteBlueEagle: What about sterak then BOTRK?
[2:25:11] merengreg: Botrk kinda useless on smolder
[2:25:16] TheGesterr: @WhiteBlueEagle Botrk is aweful on Smolder, he never auto attacks
[2:25:43] ArrowQuiver: cleaver better than bork
[2:25:47] Shiibbae: NICE
[2:25:50] Shiibbae: CLEAN
[2:25:52] merengreg: black cleaver however is quite nice, CDR and all thatt
[2:25:55] peshecito: NICE TEAMFIGHT :D
[2:25:56] Official_Owo: Where are the no damagers now pepeLoser
[2:26:06] NapNapoleon: Being able to execute while having a constant dot is really helpful gfor getting the final hit.

[2:26:56] kaiserwroth: >ezreal mains hate this new trick
[2:26:58] Shiibbae: they rlly tried to smother u out only for the rest of the team to be ignored and get ahead
[2:27:01] laikanangel: Great teammates this game
[2:27:14] Psychomatosis: considering you had a hard time on lane due to camping the champ actually gets going and scales better
[2:27:14] Shiibbae: and they still didnt even do that lol
[2:27:20] xkappaaaa: hey taco how you doing? hi everyone else :D

[2:28:33] xkappaaaa: @joshua_brandt accurate LUL
[2:28:33] SpartanDumpster: Is that why Riot takes so long to nerf Jax? Because his mains keep getting arrested?

[2:31:05] shdual: jhin has utility tho
[2:31:13] xkappaaaa: chat trying hard to make you play champs you dont want to

[2:32:19] still_here__: Wait... u are playing smolder top with graps
[2:32:19] RefiixGaming: There reason is jhin has only 4 bullets and in pro play needs to deal a freakton of dmg in team fight
[2:32:24] SpartanDumpster: Taco plays Jhin because he rhymes with "win" and that's all Taco wants to do! ikeepitLUL
[2:32:50] TheGesterr: nah I play for echo Q fuck echo W

[2:33:13] TheGesterr: shit is boring champ like that 100%
[2:33:20] RefiixGaming: I'd say in pro matches adc needs to have higher teamdmg% than solo Q and that's hard for Jhin, mb I'm wrong

[2:45:01] Elwendir: @GogetaLeagueOfLOL chat is just being a pick defensive bcs the standard on social platform is to NOT promote anything on someone else channel
[2:45:32] GogetaLeagueOfLOL: actually I wanted to promote something that won't benefit me with anything, just a social media account of one of my friends lol
[2:45:36] Syluxrox: we're being defensive because the dude is an obvious troll/bot scam account. Bros messages read like an indian scam call lmao
[2:45:45] LeeBot_bat: BMW = no need for brain. Has money, so therefore BETTER THAN EVERYONE
[2:45:58] televangelon: @GogetaLeagueOfLOL "not gonna benefit me just something i make money off of" lol

[2:57:31] P4hagen: @ikeepittaco are you making a smolder guide?
[2:57:41] dracula_coffin: General guideline is to always dodge a rengar
[2:57:47] clueless810: I feel like you should be able to cast W and Q while using E

[2:58:17] lobitoblanc0: ur winrate with smolder?
[2:58:32] dracula_coffin: Yas windwall stops my abilities, my ult, fucks my wife and kidnaps my children
[2:58:40] TheGesterr: @Mpolo98 I mean Yas W stops every projectile in the game, and Smolder ult is a projectile
[2:58:44] ArrowQuiver: the E flight shenanigans with walls is really nice. can play funky angles
[2:59:02] NapNapoleon: She runs like all hell
[2:59:09] ItsCondor: thoughs on smolder?
[2:59:21] dextrouslol: every match feels one sided
[2:59:25] clueless810: The Sm at the beginning of Smolder stand for Stack Merchant
[2:59:36] browy_eu: 7 more to go
[2:59:55] NapNapoleon: You're getting out-late-game'd gwen, yasuo, that's some late game hitters
[3:01:26] clueless810: Do you still get the stacks if the burn kills minions?

[3:02:01] Syluxrox: "why arent adcs building defensive items surely it will help"-Phreak
[3:02:05] Selene_Flore: Imagine being an ADC against Rengar
[3:02:18] Sageflower: bro why aren't you doing the phreak build? You need deaths dance and frozen heart
[3:02:20] Elwendir: should have gone frozen heart first item smh
[3:02:38] nyxionite: hello hello
[3:03:03] TheGesterr: chat is memeing
[3:03:06] TheGesterr: there is no Phreak build
[3:03:09] clueless810: Oh taco did you see the proposed changes that Phroxon posted on twitter the other day?
[3:03:11] Sageflower: phreak build is all tank items on a adc
[3:03:19] Elwendir: "adcs shoulkd build defensive items instead of going full dmng"
[3:03:26] Syluxrox: Its a meme, Phreak wants ADCs to build shitty "defensive" ADC items that make ADCs deal zero damage and STILL die in one hit lol
[3:03:40] tmanster1: Phreak says it's viable for ADC to go dd and frozen heart
[3:04:31] ampes_: anyone else thinks that Smolder W end animation is kinda meh? I expected at least some explosion with AOE dmg or a fire field/rain like Varus antiheal
[3:04:57] Pawskal: frozen heart is broken against kalista
[3:05:04] SeitanLoL: @ampes_ It's the slowest and least explosive sneeze in history
[3:05:06] NapNapoleon: Elder dragon + baron + 3 inhib down KEKW
[3:05:10] tiaro1: Zandunga!!!
[3:05:16] odetwojoy: hiya taco hiya chat, hows smolder doing today?

[3:06:54] mrbobfudge: Hi
[3:07:01] InkFlourish: taco do you mind showing your camera settings?
[3:07:12] SeitanLoL: Starting Zeke's on Nilah when playing with mage support has been my highest win rate build this season. Not even kidding.
[3:07:13] ampes_: @konungr___ yea but how the W fades out is kinda not league like? It is a big ball of fire snort or sth.. expected to happen something afterwards
[3:07:24] mr_kimon: yo tacooo how are u man
[3:07:25] Sageflower: "all defence no damage your range is all the advantage you need as a adc" - phreak
[3:07:44] Skaftoise: @IKeepItTaco Cookie was saying you did good as Smolder, best he's seen
[3:07:50] Moofie: randuins jhin ftw
[3:08:19] tmanster1: If those are the conditions to go tank ADC Id be tank every gMe
[3:08:38] Syluxrox: I really like building Randuins first item against Draven players when I'm on Jhin lmao, its so funny seeing their brains melt when they deal zero damage.
[3:08:46] danger_cringe: im almost mastery 5 on smolder is so fun to play
[3:09:13] stoez__: try comet with dorans ring and start w the poke level 1 is so unexpected
[3:09:30] mrbobfudge: yerp
[3:09:33] Sageflower: yep
[3:09:33] mrbobfudge: he sure was
[3:09:36] SeitanLoL: Phreak spams whoever he buffs

[3:13:57] GogetaLeagueOfLOL: do you guys love me? <3
