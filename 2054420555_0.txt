[1:50:34] alaksande: During periods of rain, in the pits or locations where copper wiring exists, water will often make contact with the connections. Water will severely interfere with the signals you are meant to be receiving or simply block them entirely. In your home this means slower speeds or a disconnection

[3:48:57] TBenny01: END OF LOSS STREAK!!!
[3:48:57] barbacking: thank you for streaming Pobelter
[3:48:58] Gooshman: mejadge

[3:49:16] brandoniannn: nashors smolder gogo
[3:49:16] sixtwocee: dark seal is good in lane
[3:49:17] Madrai: It's actually ok if he knows he can't be doing a lot of Q dmg, then he can do a lot of dmg with Ult and be useful every fight
[3:49:24] CiCCioBug97: For 1k gold i think so
[3:49:29] wickebine_tris: @Novitee is free win in my queues
[3:49:31] blahhhhhhhghg: Lvl 17 udhyr wtf lol
[3:49:34] silentstrike134: smolder q does have 15% scaling. maybe enough since it hits so much
[3:49:37] Timeless_Live: ad is just better on smolder
[3:49:39] Hykeir: Q has ap rations
[3:49:48] Madrai: Madrai subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:49:48] emainmagha: Upgrading to mejais makes no sense when you already got the dark seal for it's intended purpose
[3:49:48] cjmmishie: qt levels w to 3 before maxing q, that ap is probably nice in lane
[3:49:51] brandoniannn: ppl always d ring and d seal so if you have the stacks high it’s prob good

It would be pretty interesting to see where things stand before first drake and who's most likely to get most souls
