[0:41:09] wyattking88: Welcome to the English language?
[0:41:11] holyshock54: Dogs helping you look
[0:41:12] MrAr3s: i got some coaching on league and showed them the comm we played. @saltycdog1 they wanted me to tell you not to take tear first on ez
[0:41:12] imthatShaunguy: @Bustin The word derives ultimately from Latin subtilis, meaning “fine, delicate,” and was adopted into Middle English from Old French as sotil. The b was later added back in so that the spelling reflected the word's original Latin roots but the pronunciation continued to lack the b sound
[0:41:13] sarinspill: dog
[0:41:14] imthatShaunguy: From google
[0:41:33] Ekozera: The worst word ever huh.... Your thought, though, through bullshit is way worse

[0:41:39] lbardius: whole lotta yappin not a lot a carin
[0:41:40] imthatShaunguy: B was added back later but you don't pronounce it
[0:41:42] CrazedFool: tyler, the alexander show is available now if you didn't know btw
[0:41:43] CaptainSmee: @shinigamihd pretty sure that’s a French word
[0:41:44] Kiteit: omg theres a fire behind u

[0:41:48] MrAr3s: ayo @BeautifeyedGamer Pog
[0:42:01] WingOfChicken: The humidifier?
[0:42:01] Kiteit: ya watch out for that
[0:42:02] wyattking88: Huh
[0:42:06] Rainey719: that's cause it's not a english word iirc. It's pronounced the way it is due to English speakers butchering it
[0:42:06] LuckyDiffs: because the b in subtitle is silent, it subs for the t, which is the top
[0:42:14] Kiteit: i got a good skin care routine, thanks buddy

[1:37:45] sarenraej: question: my wife decided to go to therapy. We talked about it a couple months ago but she went last week and didn't tell me. Caught be by surprise and I was supportive but in the back of my mind, it upset me. Is that weird?
[1:38:44] NinjaQuay3000: Yeah for sure, gotta go outside, meet people, exercise, be healthy
[1:39:25] sarenraej: she went on wednesday. told me yesterday
[1:39:34] Snuffles1120: was it supposed to be couple's therapy and she went ahead of you?
[1:40:00] sarenraej: Normally we talk about our days nightly
[1:40:09] NinjaQuay3000: Well Ive been working out, but normal PT. Trying to get back in the gym more
[1:40:11] Sabriwi: I wish Wing knew my schedule
[1:40:36] sarenraej: not couples therapy. She is going for anxiety and stress. mostly work but we have issues ofc but not big enough that we think we need couples therapy

[1:42:25] Sabriwi: ANSWER CAREFULLY
[1:42:32] Treebeard64: :gulp"
[1:42:33] Snuffles1120: be open and honest about how you feel, but use "I feel" language vs "you x"
[1:42:37] Ekozera: At the same time, everyone has their own process to go through their issues and if for her at this point it was not bringing it up, because she was not at a point where she felt she was up to sharing that...

[1:54:09] WingOfChicken: I feel like chapter 1 every few minutes was an 'AH HAH!' moment
[1:54:12] MortalityDoesStuff: @bustin the only thing about rust that genuinely pissed me off was when I specifically snuck out of the final fight with an entire inventory of rockets and then for whatever reason the server put protections on your base so they all hit but none of them did damage
