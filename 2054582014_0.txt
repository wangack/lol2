[0:52:12] iamelvis4: sPAWN IS TRIGGERED ALREADY
[0:52:13] thoughtfulcoconut: Agree fully with this caller. C9 has had the same skeleton of the staff for years and their consistent roadblock is draft.
[0:52:13] iEnigmaaa: next question.
[0:52:15] bassnasty: dude the players have been running it down several games which is crazy
[0:52:21] leamfor: Mithy made Berserker run it down
[0:52:26] Nize2: been like that for years so
[0:52:27] leamfor: Kappa

[0:52:38] bassnasty: skeleton of the staff??????? dont they spend a solid amount???
[0:52:39] bustlinfungus: mithy needs some body guards
[0:52:40] Lyghtsaber: its an alfonso diff for sure
[0:52:42] Skizzle653: Very based take. From a traditional sports perspective, C9 is an incredibly poorly coached team. They play passive the whole game, ego pick in draft, and then lose
[0:52:48] leamfor: Kappa def no reddit
[0:52:50] xxSirlancealotx: yep Mithy told the whole team just run it down
[0:52:57] BeepImaJeep2015: I like Spawn, he's like a modern version of SaintVicious

[0:53:02] dan_e_: lol not having a reddit doesnt stop you from seeing reddit bro

[0:53:10] brosciencegym: C9 needs to bring back the originals SNEAKY, MEATY O's Hai
[0:53:10] i_play_viktor: the draft's are atrocious
[0:53:11] trollinn69: they either are poorly coached or don’t listen to their coach, both of which are reasons to change
[0:53:11] Stevenator546: yeah mithy instructed Berserker to E forward on lucian I think
[0:53:11] Jon_Oki: that karma from demolishing eyla on twitter

[0:54:57] azynce: it definitely feels like their issue that they arent playing together as a team at all though
[0:55:01] thoughtfulcoconut: the players are running it but mithy is enabling bad drafts. If you cant identify and push back on picks that aren't working, the buck stops at the coach
[0:55:03] urgotabekidding: Who made the decision to give APA ziggs tho?  Teams didn't really have an answer for it last split and it seems they still don't
[0:55:06] leamfor: Fudge hasn't existed this entire split
[0:55:18] Maokwa: C9 just seem to have lost all confidence after that fail dive during the SR game, they play scared. Especially blaber.
[0:55:25] azynce: i think fudge specifically is being blamed for a lot when his bot side runs it down every game
[0:55:36] omegadc2: where is ssumday
[0:55:40] KSnOwnage: lul

[0:56:44] hellohihi145: @travisgafford but the systems!
[0:56:46] poe_viewer: Fudge needs a new 1v1 partner if he keeps ignoring CQ/soloQ
[0:57:00] thoughtfulcoconut: how is more cooks in the kitchen the solution? They already can't come to proper conclusions. more opinions without the context of the team isn't the answer
[0:57:05] BeepImaJeep2015: When you are paying your players and coach too much and they are not delivering, the solution is to pay more people more money PogChamp
[0:57:10] iEnigmaaa: @baxeson Licorice doesnt have a team
[0:57:11] CouchyHOTS: c9 also had duffman during worlds last year and dropped him after, so i'm sure they'd admit they could use more
[0:57:25] dan_e_: @thoughtfulcoconut NRG won last split with a cook at every position dude
[0:57:30] itsDiscoCisco: flyquest was literally just better lol
[0:57:39] rlpavel: What are the instructions to call in again?
[0:57:47] rlpavel: @numiiigoesrawrz
[0:57:47] Wyrmoslol: force ruler to retire and hire him as coach

[0:58:05] profitguru: @rlpavel Aren't you in the Sub Calls right now?
[0:58:05] thoughtfulcoconut: @dan_e_ because they'd been there and had context and a unified vision. adding more people to an already dysfunctional team is not the answer
[0:58:17] leamfor: The dash in is still grief. Bwipo said it didnt matter that they got 3
[0:58:20] rudiferr: von yeod
[0:58:23] roshp: @thoughtfulcoconut you really think the cooks wouldnt coordinate their decisions before talking to the team LUL what kind of management do u think goes on
[0:58:31] trollinn69: but why draft something that hard loses to a double ward placement kill?
[0:58:45] SillyLittle_Guy_: @rudiferr I thought i was tripping
[0:58:50] thoughtfulcoconut: @roshp clearly not competent management for the last 14 years of the scene. the proof is in the pudding
[0:58:51] echo4october: @trollinn69 why double ward same bush ?
[0:58:55] dan_e_: @thoughtfulcoconut oh you're saying they didn't start with the support system so getting more support system is useless?
[0:59:00] OG_Plumwick: vulcan is worse than zven at support fight me
[0:59:01] Stevenator546: @trollinn69 why draft something that relies on professional players not making a solo queue level mistake KEKW
[0:59:03] Karpeezy: ACTUALLY?

[0:59:19] KSnOwnage: LCS production sabotaging LUL

[0:59:21] hellohihi145: MARKKKK
[0:59:24] nfcpm: So Yeon would you say it's you and the other player fault for the 3 losses?
[0:59:29] Tameablebread93: DAMMIT MARK KEKW
[0:59:31] omegadc2: yeon should had threw hands
[0:59:32] BeepImaJeep2015: It'd be funny if they subbed Vulcan for Eyla or Winsome.
[0:59:33] profitguru: @rlpavel Yeah that's it. Wait to see if Cubby pulls you to the waiting room
[0:59:40] itsDiscoCisco: where's travis at chat?
[0:59:45] Lyghtsaber: aint no way next thing you know they're gonna come move your monitor
[0:59:45] thoughtfulcoconut: @roshp spending a lot of money every year and getting people hype over domestic results isn't good management. that's the BARE minimum
[0:59:51] Jacmert: Hi Spawn
[0:59:52] Konnoke: #TLWIN

[1:00:03] urgotabekidding: If your only win condition is hard win bot lane isn't your draft too challenging?
[1:00:05] golden_ks: TL>C9
[1:00:17] Stevenator546: I can't believe chat pretending that Mithy should just not draft Berserker and Vulcan good champions because they made a mistake in lane
[1:00:18] inero: Why is spawn using a McDonalds drive thru microphone
[1:00:19] golden_ks: fudge.
[1:00:19] Jacmert: the solution is simple: no sneaky, no worlds

[1:00:47] hellohihi145: it is the systems! trust the systems!
[1:00:53] moonfish817: C9 the Phoenix Suns of the NBA
[1:00:54] Prophet181: @inero he is doing a live interview to coach for team mcdonalds
[1:00:59] profitguru: What % of resources should Yeon get @alwaysplanahealol ?
[1:01:03] AngelHorror: spawn actually spitting facts at the moment
[1:01:04] Maokwa: @inero the c9 subreddit want jack to hire you to fix the mess LUL
[1:01:07] urgotabekidding: IMT is a good team
[1:01:10] aanotherwworld: coaches are also overrated
[1:01:12] leamfor: NRG lost to IMT
[1:01:13] iEnigmaaa: ^
[1:01:13] rogaine_saintvicious2: but they downgraded support and mid :)
[1:01:16] thoughtfulcoconut: @roshp they got out of groups once. woooooooo
[1:01:17] inero: @Maokwa I'm 1-2 in NACL why want me
[1:01:18] moonfish817: Or early Harden trade Clippers

[1:01:22] Aerof0xx: yeah every team seems good
[1:01:24] iEnigmaaa: ^ to IMT is a good team, not overrated coaches
[1:01:25] roshp: @thoughtfulcoconut your takes are so bad you're making me defend C9 lmao I didn't believe it was possible
[1:01:27] dan_e_: true DIG Picks have been good
[1:01:32] mumbIer: yeah but we dont have eyeballs
[1:01:34] psydefexx: yeah ngl lcs been kinda slappin
[1:01:35] golden_ks: Based on
[1:01:35] DeeJay_USA: 100T is vibing
[1:01:36] Lyghtsaber: LCS > LEC this year for sure
[1:01:36] yanya7701: @inero the problem is why are you in NACL
[1:01:38] a_blue_snivy: im really excited to see how this turns out when theres no change to the team lmoa
[1:01:44] imhei: everyone is mid
[1:01:45] Todo88: Can't wait to win MSI this year
[1:01:47] urgotabekidding: I think this is the most evenly matched the LCS has ever been from top to bottom
[1:01:47] psydefexx: and the broadcast crew is been killing it
[1:01:48] poe_viewer: Good is kinda copium but I understand what you mean
[1:01:51] Maokwa: @inero mithy evil, inero good. No logic in their head lol
[1:01:51] profitguru: NA >>>> EU this split 100%
[1:01:53] topraymond_: its actually been exciting that the standings are pretty close
[1:01:55] imhei: all random all mid
[1:01:55] thoughtfulcoconut: @roshp i think your bar for what defines success is horrifically low
[1:01:55] golden_ks: So why are they losing if they are good?
[1:01:57] hellohihi145: everyone is def mid
[1:02:03] psydefexx: @profitguru based
[1:02:07] inero: @inero Still with warriors so not rly looking
[1:02:08] aanotherwworld: 100t, nrg, imt, fq are all just vibey teams
[1:02:08] PapaSmithy: watch the games there's very few fiestas all the teams can catch throws and close
[1:02:10] bassnasty: broadcast has been incredible @psydefexx
[1:02:18] BugsBunnysBalls: na is winning worlds confirmed
[1:02:18] rogaine_saintvicious2: spicas last split LUL
[1:02:19] WopaPlays: im silver but my genuine take is that LCS looks straight up better
[1:02:25] inero: @inero whoops,meant @yanya7701
[1:02:31] roshp: @thoughtfulcoconut I think you're full of shit and have no idea what you're talking about
[1:02:38] profitguru: Spawn watching all the other team's scrims, what kind of cheats are these?
[1:02:38] Jacmert: GIVE ME HOPE SPAWN
[1:02:38] psydefexx: rap god been at his best
[1:02:41] THEcodybauman: Papasmithy doesn't blow smoke
[1:02:43] dan_e_: teams I thought would be at the bottom (IMT and DIG) are playing good
[1:02:44] rogaine_saintvicious2: i love my boy but hes been on some very non-dominant teams for years
[1:02:48] Andyyybarton: B01 hype
[1:02:51] urgotabekidding: Bo3 please!
[1:02:52] Jacmert: WATCH OUT, MSI. NA gonna bring it this year
[1:02:52] womboboys: 7 are the only ones that really matter
[1:02:57] thoughtfulcoconut: @roshp that's not exactly an argument. but if you wanna ad-hominem, go ahead
[1:03:03] THEcodybauman: Bo2, for regular season
[1:03:03] kawallaa: c9 is not a super team. you have to be the best in every role to be a super team. fudge last year and this year may not be top 4. Vulcan may be the best just by how weak supports are. stop calling them a super team.
[1:03:04] Stevenator546: This is literally the highest level of parity I've ever seen in the LCS and I've been watching since Season 2
[1:03:10] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:03:11] poe_viewer: 14 games to see who the best team in the league is LUL
[1:03:13] psydefexx: we should do bo3 season like others
[1:03:15] nfcpm: yeah, cubby were you sad Markz said no to best of 2?
[1:03:15] THEcodybauman: No one will watch Bo3 fully
[1:03:17] Cubbyxx: Haitham is the goat
[1:03:18] megablue_: g2 LUL
[1:03:21] roshp: @thoughtfulcoconut yeah its as useful as any of your comments I just stooped to your level
[1:03:25] Maokwa: @jacmert calm down you'll be dissapointed again
[1:03:30] hellohihi145: WE ARE HAITHHEADS
[1:03:35] aanotherwworld: the league is really competitive and there is still players who are free agents who theoretically could make some teams better. Spica, Stixxay, Licorice
[1:03:38] Jacmert: @Maokwa "always have been"
[1:03:46] tbmustang: rapidstar Pog
[1:03:49] moonfish817: DONTMASHME
[1:03:50] rogaine_saintvicious2: dont mash me?
[1:03:50] thoughtfulcoconut: @roshp not at all what happened but sure. your inability to actually articulate an argument is showing
[1:03:50] bassnasty: @kawallaa arent you implying that htey have everyone but fudge as the best in role then with that comment?
[1:03:51] THEcodybauman: Weighted Bo2 would fix so much for the league.
[1:04:08] rogaine_saintvicious2: now thats an adc who knows how to blow through the throws
[1:04:10] epicalbawler: Spica and stixxay are washed
[1:04:10] rudeclawlol: Dontmashme PrideHeartL
[1:04:13] Jacmert: No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again
[1:04:24] omegadc2: look at yeon, he’s the coach now
[1:04:30] kawallaa: @bassnasty not Vulcan either. very over rated past year and a half.
[1:04:31] iEnigmaaa: NRG got memed on for too many coaches... yet who was the most successful NA team
[1:04:35] roshp: @thoughtfulcoconut all you have articulated is taking my view of success and saying its wrong KEKW you think that's analysis?
[1:05:07] WopaPlays: worth bcuz jojo looks best on that roster imo
[1:05:13] thoughtfulcoconut: @roshp i didnt say it was wrong. i said your bar was low. there's a difference
[1:05:21] inero: Travis why does everyone but you sound like they're in a drive thru mic what have you done to the audio settings
[1:05:34] inero: DO BETTER @travisgafford
[1:05:37] golden_ks: C9 Jack just doesn’t care about lol anymore

[1:05:43] rudeclawlol: This is a wendys
[1:05:45] PapaSmithy: @inero how's working with Milan
[1:05:45] golden_ks: so no support for the team
[1:05:46] attackonhumby: @kawallaa isn't damonte positional coaching at flyquest this split? NRG last split and flyquest this split, RESULTS hasWicked hasWicked
[1:05:48] golden_ks: just flashy names
[1:05:54] rogaine_saintvicious2: spent all their money all chipotle
[1:05:54] inero: @PapaSmithy Hate him
[1:05:57] sexualeagle: Antithesis of a stacked deck
[1:05:58] travisgafford: @baxeson think it's more like 56 games and then an entire playoffs bracket
[1:05:59] profitguru: @kawallaa Fudge literally 1st team all pro last spring and 3rd team all pro in summer...
[1:05:59] DeeJay_USA: team cohesion matters

[1:15:25] thoughtfulcoconut: weekly SOTL shill
[1:15:26] profitguru: @Yeon7lol did Dodo get you your new PC for at home? Or do I still owe you one?
[1:15:41] Yeon7lol: I got one don't worry
[1:15:44] aboringmac: @travisgafford didn't you just copy the PROS podcast? :)
[1:15:54] Muzvein: I didn't want to make it too long as a send off Sorry Spawn love you too!
[1:15:58] StuckInCoolCourt: Was good to see you at Dragonsteel @travisgafford Stormlight 5  Hype!
[1:15:58] dan_e_: you should fudge and yeon on at once so we can get properly fucked
[1:16:03] hellohihi145: @travisgafford stop copying marks ideas
[1:16:23] WopaPlays: Rafaa Pog
[1:16:28] PapaSmithy: could you explain why that's funny for the podcast listeners travis
[1:16:31] MacDaAce: pog af
[1:16:32] OG_Plumwick: true dan
[1:16:33] profitguru: Travis makes more ads for a podcast that doesn't exist anymore than actual products
[1:16:45] numiiigoesrawrz: it pays me too
[1:16:46] RaafaaCasts: <3
[1:16:59] jedstarromero: CT represent!

[1:17:16] golden_ks: great take!
[1:17:17] onlytanking: woot
[1:17:21] topraymond_: based
[1:17:25] PapaSmithy: Spawn can leak that NA side has wanted to reduce to 8 forever
[1:17:26] CSiers: omg lcs caster @RaafaaCasts
[1:17:27] numiiigoesrawrz: take: 8 LCS teams is good for the league, gives more times to player storylines and makes teams like IMT and DIG fun
[1:17:27] rogaine_saintvicious2: we got a bluejay take tooday?
[1:17:38] hellohihi145: spawn leak it!
[1:17:45] PapaSmithy: i heard it for years internally haha
[1:17:48] urgotabekidding: There legitimately aren't any match-ups where I feel like I should just turn off the broadcast and move on.  whereas in the past the bottom two teams were generally pretty low quality games
[1:17:51] nfcpm: i wonder if it's because any team can win.
[1:17:54] numiiigoesrawrz: @hellohihi145 travis pays me in influencer bucks /s
[1:18:00] Aerof0xx: spawn is a keychain spinning god that I could only dream of achieving
[1:18:03] nfcpm: like there are no garbage teams right now
[1:18:06] Muzvein: I feel like a really good thing is every team has a player to be "the face of the team" this year
[1:18:08] thoughtfulcoconut: @urgotabekidding anything with IMT is pretty residentSleeper to me

[1:18:13] profitguru: Thank god bottom dwellers GG and EG are out of the league
[1:18:17] Hack377: The fact that C9 isn't stomping has also been a really great thing for competitiveness and each game mattering so much
[1:18:17] poe_viewer: 8 teams is better but BO1s is still criminal
[1:18:20] the1andonlycorbin: the1andonlycorbin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:18:24] MattScoot2: @PapaSmithy i just wish we had more games. 14 is ass
[1:18:30] WopaPlays: okay but getting rid of EG management? so worth
[1:18:34] hellohihi145: BO1s are just so little league in total
[1:18:36] hellohihi145: and I hate that
[1:18:39] PapaSmithy: im confident mark is listening, and there's scope for a different format summer
[1:18:46] DeeJay_USA: the new production and broadcast time is the best it has ever been
[1:18:51] zerovisible: lcs is the best it's been in awhile despite viewer count

[1:19:00] hellohihi145: WHATS WITH THE TWO WEEK BREAK THATS FUCKED
[1:19:02] Prophet181: less games and faster transition times makes the day so short
[1:19:04] Stevenator546: This is literally the highest level of parity I've ever seen in the LCS and I've been watching since Season 2. I missed a few splits but can another League boomer verify if thats true?
[1:19:07] rogaine_saintvicious2: theres challengers right after LUL
[1:19:14] urgotabekidding: @hellohihi145 stadium needed for VCT
[1:19:19] WopaPlays: the stream is so incredibly watchable actually
[1:19:23] WopaPlays: just get rid of pauses
[1:19:25] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:19:28] poe_viewer: LCS starting an hour later now is better too cause I can actually watch the first game after the LEC finishes
[1:19:30] hellohihi145: @urgotabekidding it’s massive coping imho
[1:19:33] rudiferr: The "things that people want for LCS" really sound like it's coming from a very loud vocal minority over the years
[1:19:34] hellohihi145: like
[1:19:38] RaafaaCasts: @CSiers omg is that IMT socials Charlie?
[1:19:38] hellohihi145: they just don’t wanna pay
[1:19:44] profitguru: BO2 with fearless in summer, I beg you. It's literally the best potential outcome of more entertaining games
[1:19:48] MattScoot2: it feels like you cant really experiment with only 14 games.
[1:19:50] hellohihi145: you can do it remote
[1:19:55] CSiers: @RaafaaCasts i dont even have the twitter password man
[1:19:59] Tameablebread93: great answer
[1:20:00] a_blue_snivy: Based spawn
[1:20:02] Fredthefree: less teams also means people are more inclined to watch NACL
[1:20:03] Todo88: Guess that makes sense when 6/8 teams make playoffs
[1:20:08] hellohihi145: what’s the point of live patch if u don’t feel comfortable to innovate
[1:20:21] hellohihi145: and when there’s only 14 games
[1:20:24] RaafaaCasts: REAL
[1:20:25] hellohihi145: when r u gunna innovate
[1:20:46] iEnigmaaa: Bo5s*
[1:20:48] gurg7: bo9 or die
[1:20:50] iEnigmaaa: Kappa
[1:20:51] Noreason_4: lcs never innovates
[1:20:52] RaafaaCasts: LCS SUMMER TO BO2/BO3 POR FAVOORRR :prayer:
[1:20:53] a_blue_snivy: spitting facts is what he doing
[1:20:55] Ian7j2: pls no BO2
[1:21:01] Noreason_4: idk who lied and said live patch would lead to innovation
[1:21:02] Pita26: @gurg7 bo11 minimum
[1:21:05] bassnasty: lmao @gurg7
[1:21:11] JohrDinh: MLG BO11 losers bracket
[1:21:11] Noreason_4: berserker wont play champs until gumayusi does
[1:21:20] gurg7: bo9 but each game is on a different patch
[1:21:22] DavidSzajnuk: BO3 plz
[1:21:25] poe_viewer: BASED APA
[1:21:31] CSiers: bo7 please
[1:21:34] WopaPlays: based content king apa
[1:21:38] numiiigoesrawrz: charlie i would like to have weekends
[1:21:41] numiiigoesrawrz: bo0
[1:21:42] DavidSzajnuk: fine by me
[1:21:43] profitguru: God BO2! It's actually so good
[1:21:43] numiiigoesrawrz: zero games
[1:21:48] CSiers: TRUEEE
[1:21:48] numiiigoesrawrz: everyone hates the LCS / s
[1:21:56] CSiers: lets go back to week days
[1:22:03] AyyeKaleb: Just do it like LCK does it.
[1:22:04] Hack377: While reducing the amount of players in the league does suck for people not getting a shot and having a job, it really has helped learn who the players are and get more invested since most people seem to care more about individual players over teams
[1:22:06] iEnigmaaa: facts
[1:22:10] RaafaaCasts: in order to do bo3 right we would need 3 showdays a week
[1:22:15] plumdaddy93: no one likes ties
[1:22:23] RaafaaCasts: otherwise if we are stuck on 2 showdays we can only do 1 bo3 per team
[1:22:28] alwaysplanahealol: i just want to play more games
[1:22:28] hellohihi145: WHY NOT
[1:22:28] bondance: I'm fine with ties
[1:22:29] alwaysplanahealol: thats all
[1:22:31] hellohihi145: WHY NOTTT
[1:22:32] shinwinter: WHY ?
[1:22:32] JohrDinh: I dont need BO3 I just want playoffs to start after 2 weeks
[1:22:36] profitguru: BO2, 4x round robin
[1:22:41] oldgegamer: real talk
[1:22:43] iEnigmaaa: to be fair Travis is right esp with Riot cutting jobs
[1:22:43] cln2013: we are not LPL and LCK we cant support BO3
[1:22:44] FAZERKEX: @travisgafford How about something like the LEC Format?
[1:22:50] StuckInCoolCourt: there is no way they will do best of 3 it takes to long
[1:22:55] WopaPlays: this is why we need to viewbot LCS until they make it BO3
[1:23:03] JohrDinh: The problem is just regular season is kinda mid...below mid
[1:23:03] iEnigmaaa: 2 bo3s per team per week Clap
[1:23:05] StuckInCoolCourt: and best of 2 is legit terrible if there is a tie
[1:23:07] razlol: king spawn
[1:23:15] narvuntien: OPL love forever
[1:23:26] razlol: LMFAO YEP
[1:23:27] travisgafford: @alwaysplanahealol I know, I was just teasing, but I also think people don't realize that you'd probably only play 1 additional game, and if only if both teams went 1:1
[1:23:42] shinwinter: yeah COZ they have 17 teams
[1:24:00] rudeclawlol: raz sleeps at riot currently no?
[1:24:12] KSnOwnage: How does LEC do it when they make less than LCS?
[1:24:16] JohrDinh: They could...from Chicago:)
[1:24:17] profitguru: The answer is right there
[1:24:17] megablue_: what about a featured bo3 in studio and the rest bo3 played from home?
[1:24:19] profitguru: BO2
[1:24:19] urgotabekidding: I think they could make it work with 3 days
[1:24:21] a_blue_snivy: 3>2
[1:24:27] WopaPlays: LCS goes back to Phreak's basement so they can afford it
[1:24:34] razlol: @rudeclawlol to dis day
[1:24:41] poe_viewer: It's ok we can keep enjoying our Mickey Mouse region BO1s :'(
[1:24:45] KSnOwnage: LEC has 3-4 days a week and RIOT said they make less than LCS
[1:24:56] aussome47: it's tiring how shortsightedness lcs is about lol for years and this is just another one
[1:24:57] RaafaaCasts: if riot can't increase amount of showdays in the split, then bo2 double round robin is the only way we can increase amount of games while maitaining relatively the same costs, I would prefer bo3s but riot would have to increase budget to allow 3 or more shows per week during regular season
[1:25:01] hellohihi145: @ksnownage actually yrue
[1:25:02] NihilistGamer1: Why not just single bo3 tho?
[1:25:07] Gengariffith: So best of 2 is superior
[1:25:12] Gengariffith: Glad Travis agrees
[1:25:13] omegadc2: goodnight, well, watch when on YouTube
[1:25:15] hellohihi145: why not do 3 showdays
[1:25:16] DeeJay_USA: Travis has a penny rich dollar poor mentality
[1:25:26] narvuntien: I think the 4 day week is the expectation
[1:25:28] nfcpm: every weeks is a super week
[1:25:30] StuckInCoolCourt: even if its best of 2 its legit twice as long
[1:25:32] profitguru: @RaafaaCasts Raafaa being such a chad once again. He gets it. BO2 ftw
[1:25:33] Lyghtsaber: yeah travis we def haven;t watched LPL or LCK. we have no clue how b03 works
[1:25:33] cln2013: @travisgafford Why cant LCS do 3 days of BO3 3 games per day some teams will have to play 2 days in a row but most teams play a BO3 on friday than sunday for example @Spawnthecaster @Cubbyxx
[1:25:36] iEnigmaaa: they CAN afford it, they just dont want to
[1:25:36] rlpavel: Based best of 2 enjoyers in chat
[1:25:47] poe_viewer: LOL
[1:25:47] Ooklei: LuL 󠀀
[1:25:48] i_play_viktor: just have the weekday bo3s played on line
[1:25:49] MarcusMan6RL: Wait what did he say about  Spring Finals?
[1:25:54] dan_e_: lets just all be kids spawn ur right
[1:25:54] profitguru: I will shill bo2 until my fingers bleed
[1:25:55] WopaPlays: LUL SANTA MARKZ
[1:25:59] bondance: Travis is the Krampus of the LCS
[1:26:08] Fredthefree: I asked Santa for a car, but he never came through
[1:26:12] desemaia: B02 would be nice. B01s with 8 teams goes too fast.
[1:26:12] poe_viewer: incoming single round robin BO3s a split LOL
[1:26:13] bassnasty: lol I appreciate them discussing this topic though
[1:26:18] brosciencegym: Riot wont do that to NA, NA is boring
[1:26:20] razlol: "becareful what you ask for" - Travis
[1:26:22] cln2013: Why cant LCS do 3 days of BO3 3 games per day some teams will have to play 2 days in a row but most teams play a BO3 on friday than sunday for example
[1:26:24] c9_bobby: plz BO2, not bc it's the best but just most feasible and gives more games
[1:26:27] Edwxrd3: MARK DO B03s MF
[1:26:29] PapaSmithy: i'll take single round robin bo3 but ya its a fucking blower
[1:26:32] Edwxrd3: or bo2
[1:26:36] enshero: I think BO2s first will happen
[1:26:43] cln2013: didnt mean to send twice
[1:26:47] baconvsworld: Travis get off riots dick bro
[1:26:53] yanya7701: bo2s are worse than bo1s
[1:26:56] nocturnavi: With so few matches it feels like experimenting is super risky
[1:26:58] Edwxrd3: hey @PapaSmithy fancy seeing you here. Usually see on Kelsey's stream
[1:27:08] brosciencegym: NA LCS is too boring for a bo3
[1:27:17] thoughtfulcoconut: The lack of finality in a Bo2 is a big drawback
[1:27:20] Veila24: The audience for LCS is dying, why not at least try to increase parity between other regions by making the splits Bo3 to better prepare them for international competition, and perhaps attract viewers who like the more competitive aspect of Best ofs
[1:27:21] poe_viewer: ideally we should get double round robin BO3s but Riot will never do that for us
[1:27:25] yanya7701: @Noirlol1 its rly not. Hes here every week
[1:27:28] StuckInCoolCourt: 4 games right now is a football game but even best of 2 is 8 hours of games only hardcore fans are really going to watch that
[1:27:33] profitguru: Cut down to 6 teams now and then do bo3 double round robin kekW
[1:27:34] OldManMovingSlow: BO3>BO2>BO1 (more games)
[1:27:41] Edwxrd3: @yanya7701 yea well im not, which is what makes it fancy
[1:27:52] wimpy91: from a betting standpoint - 2 bo3s suck compared to all teams playing 😂😂😂
[1:27:56] profitguru: @OldManMovingSlow BO5>BO4>BO3
[1:27:57] travisgafford: @baconvsworld elaborate?
[1:28:12] StuckInCoolCourt: guys realize all 700 of us watching this are hardocre fans most people wont watch that lojng
[1:28:18] steph_curry_no1_fan: why dont teams just win every game? are they stupid?
[1:28:18] leamfor: Return to S4 type of schedule

[1:28:25] leamfor: There were 8 teams then.
[1:28:32] teetii_: How can Riot not afford road shows, but the Halo Esports scene can?
[1:28:36] yanya7701: Travis stop being a shill for bo1s for no reason, not everything is about viewership
[1:28:46] Veila24: @StuckInCoolCourt I'm a hardcore fan, hence why I stopped watching LCS and instead watch LCK vods
[1:28:49] julesSuperHD: I'm okay with 4 bo3's a week
[1:28:51] urgotabekidding: Hybrid? 3 bo1s/day and the last match of the day is a bo3
[1:28:58] PapaSmithy: guys here's a simplified but directionally true statement
[1:28:59] Veila24: If they added Best of 3s for LCS I'd be more interested
[1:29:04] baconvsworld: Yeah fuck the viewership we need more matches
[1:29:05] Muzvein: What the fans don't understand how things actually work???
[1:29:07] PapaSmithy: every time the stream goes live for lcs on a day, it costs $100,000
[1:29:08] TrevorMonreal: I thought Riot said we were more profitable than the LCK
[1:29:10] PapaSmithy: and the budget is going down
[1:29:12] thoughtfulcoconut: LCS is a fraction of LCK lol
[1:29:13] bussy_bopper: but we have palafaker?
[1:29:15] PapaSmithy: turning on the lights costs $100,000
[1:29:15] yanya7701: how different?
[1:29:15] poe_viewer: We don't care about Riot's budget, we just want what's best for the league
[1:29:17] Cyanteal: Just run LCS 7 days a week knutsPoggspin
[1:29:17] baconvsworld: More Hames equals more entertainment
[1:29:24] Lyghtsaber: travis respectfully youre the out of sync one. you're just talking business, we're talking about the product we want to see
[1:29:28] JinnAxel: @TrevorMonreal Wasn't that like, a 3 year old statement?
[1:29:30] Edwxrd3: @PapaSmithy a lot of money damn. 200k per week lol
[1:29:31] PapaSmithy: they can't turn on the lights more days a week
[1:29:33] bondance: Travis doesn't want more LCS because it would cut into his Magic time
[1:29:35] profitguru: @PapaSmithy easy solve, never turn off the lights. Big brain.
[1:29:37] dan_e_: @travisgafford said it costs a dollar
[1:29:37] BeepImaJeep2015: If Spawn want to waste Riot's budget, he should at least ask for free steak dinners for players once a week.
[1:29:41] desemaia: @PapaSmithy lets go back to Phreak's basement, is that still an option?
[1:29:44] ollieoily: @Lyghtsaber ?
[1:29:44] narvuntien: reasons I don't watcht the LCS... I am in the OPL time zone
[1:29:46] TrevorMonreal: @TrevorMonreal It could of been, it just felt sooner
[1:29:50] greatsupplol: They lose money on every broadcast day, correct? So then yeah it won't make sense financially unless they had like online games some broadcast days
[1:29:53] Lyghtsaber: @ollieoily ??
[1:29:55] X_Cape: @Lyghtsaber yet those are one in the same when attempting to get the product back into profit
[1:29:59] scrapabidoopimpaff: @teetii_ i dont know much about the halo scene but does halo has 4 completely different league running at the same time and each needing a road show ? Not including interantional one ?
[1:30:02] leamfor: S4 had 4 Round Robins for 8 teams. I think we could do something similar. Maybe 3 RRs?
[1:30:04] aussome47: it's been done wrong for years and always the negative view on how to do it. short term planning and understanding.
[1:30:04] nfcpm: the cost of the site is only 1 issue
[1:30:05] hellohihi145: unironically I think if they need to do it remote and then we get double round robin bo3 id be happier
[1:30:06] Ikancast: at this point just give me the same format for 2 years in a row. it seems to have changed every year for the past decade

[1:30:11] echo4october: go buy skins so Rito can pump $ into the LCS into the loss leader we want
[1:30:12] SevTST: Do you think it would be more expensive to do one roadshow or extra days in studio?
[1:30:14] MattScoot2: @PapaSmithy 1 remote day a week.
[1:30:14] JohrDinh: Idk why they dont move the league to a cheaper city, seems to be a massive hinderance
[1:30:20] MattScoot2: easy
[1:30:22] baconvsworld: Honestly we should triple or quad round Robin for summer split
[1:30:22] MattScoot2: 5head
[1:30:25] iamelvis4: David a 100T schill??? Kappa
[1:30:32] Veila24: Spawm looks like Vaush
[1:30:34] d3xy_h: Frankly idc where finals are played until the league stops being 4fun 14 game seasons
[1:30:41] JohrDinh: BO3 6 teams in a far cheaper city, profit
[1:30:46] Edwxrd3: @iamelvis4 hes been that. But we love david great personality in the scene
[1:30:47] Muzvein: I think the thing people often forget is that people who watch interact with this show/twitter are like the top 10% of interactive fans
[1:30:54] ohhjared: what about a hybrid approach where some games are played online and some in the studio?
[1:30:54] mithrilblue: @travisgafford why does Bo5 work for Valorant then???? is that also a crazy different ecosystem??
[1:30:55] StuckInCoolCourt: @Veila24 i agree i watch other regions, i also know im in the minority, so i think its crazy to expect NA causuals to spend 8 hours watching league
[1:30:59] Lyghtsaber: ty spawn for verbalizing that
[1:30:59] imhei: the solution is obviously best of 5s
[1:31:00] leamfor: Just do a triple round robin!
[1:31:04] StudioSp1cy: As someone who's watched LCS since s3, number of games has always been my lowest priority in terms of enjoyment
[1:31:06] Edwxrd3: @JohrDinh even then it still wont be profitable
[1:31:07] teetii_: @scrapabidoopimpaff they are all separate events yes, but placing in them qualifies as points for the worlds tournament - each tournament also has online events to place for the upcoming LAN event
[1:31:11] X_Cape: Reminder also that NA's best year at worlds was a year of BO1. If it was just a competitive issue, I would still say no
[1:31:20] poe_viewer: Viewership isn't going up anyway so may as well try something new regardless
[1:31:20] cln2013: thats why you do 3 days of LCS and each team plays 2 BO3s a week
[1:31:22] Hack377: Would they ever move LCS out of LA?
[1:31:23] profitguru: The Solution is MR12
[1:31:23] echo4october: @johrdinh Chicago for that sweet sweet 6 ping like Korea
[1:31:26] urgotabekidding: Honestly I'd probably watch less league if C9 only played 1 day of the week
[1:31:31] MattScoot2: 2 best of 3's a week for every team. 2 in person, 3 remote days. easy
[1:31:32] nfcpm: 2 best of 2s make the most sense
[1:31:36] narvuntien: wait I got it.. everyweek is superweek
[1:31:41] aussome47: yeah, anti stuff is travis
[1:31:46] JohrDinh: @echo4october I have 12 in Detroit, its a dream compared to previous 60-70
[1:31:55] travisgafford: @aussome47 wtf, did you see my video this week on spring finals!
[1:31:56] travisgafford: wild
[1:31:57] ThexCatmanx: If they do best of threes we have to break the league into 2 divisions
[1:32:11] DeeJay_USA: one best of 5
[1:32:13] narvuntien: not with only 8 teams
[1:32:15] poe_viewer: LCK/LPL feels great to watch because we get to watch it almost every day, whereas we snooze for a 4hr broadcast twice a week on weekends
[1:32:22] teetii_: @scrapabidoopimpaff but yes, they also have different regions running at the same time, but the opening online events are normally each weekend 3-4 weeks in advance of the LAN
[1:32:29] Veila24: @StuckInCoolCourt Fans already tune out during shit games like IMT vs DIG, they don't have to watch every match. Besides, if the splits were Bo3 perhaps NA teams would be more prepared for international play and increase their results there, attracting viewership to NA
[1:32:30] JinnAxel: @MattScoot2 that leaves only 2 practice days if they keep the monday day off
[1:32:31] echo4october: @johrdinh yeah mine was 60 now it’s 13 wireless and 6 hardwirded
[1:32:32] profitguru: Such a positive take went down such a rabbit hole of negativity
[1:32:33] mithrilblue: meanwhile Valorant, CoD and Halo playing best of 5s
[1:32:37] CouchyHOTS: LUL
[1:32:39] dan_e_: no shit teams until we get to worlds and then we're all shit
[1:32:41] aussome47: one video versus so many shows like this doesn't make up for it
[1:32:45] FAZERKEX: LUL
[1:32:48] Jeankof: we all know its dig and imt KEKW
[1:32:49] bingbongACE: CAUGHT LUL
[1:32:52] BeepImaJeep2015: *WINK*
[1:32:53] LSF_Frog: so dig and immortals
[1:32:55] CouchyHOTS: travis clearly meant team liquid but didnt wanna get kicked out
[1:32:55] hellohihi145: lol this stream has been down in viewership but man teh chat is active
[1:32:57] I_Saika: Lec literally just did2 bo3 weekend
[1:32:59] N_Wojo: freudian slip LOL
[1:32:59] thauleris: I'd definitely rather have 1bo2 than 2 bo1 - make the series feel engaging, give mini dramatic moments
[1:33:05] bowenchung: if regular season play went to Bo3's then what would happen for playoffs? Would it continue to be Bo3's or Bo5s for playoffs?
[1:33:09] ohhjared: id love to see a more budget cast on weekdays (think challengers) and then normal broadcast on weekends.
[1:33:09] X_Cape: So many doomers, not enough hope-ers
[1:33:15] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:33:22] profitguru: Yeon was it fun to clap Prince?
[1:33:24] CouchyHOTS: @hellohihi145 he is dual casting to yt now
[1:33:24] Tameablebread93: good question
[1:33:24] dan_e_: @aussome47 yea but they one video is from the one person you're accusing so...
[1:33:26] bondance: So Travis, we could kick out Dig and IMT because you hate them so much, and then go to 6 teams Bo3s, 6-9 games a night, 2 nights a week!
[1:33:28] travisgafford: @hellohihi145 we split viewership with youtube now
[1:33:32] nfcpm: but according to Jensen the people we import are not the good international players
[1:33:33] Veila24: @hellohihi145 Because for some reason Travis exclusively covers NA/LCS, and since that scene is dying, so will Travis's streams/videos
[1:33:36] desemaia: could some of the games be done remotely?
[1:33:37] KSnOwnage: LUL
[1:33:39] a_blue_snivy: lmao
[1:33:42] FAZERKEX: WHAR
[1:33:43] poe_viewer: fake ADC LUL
[1:33:44] mithrilblue: imagine TRYING Bo3s just for the sake of us losing 2 weeks if games……
[1:33:45] CouchyHOTS: NAME PLATES OFF BABY BASED
[1:33:49] urgotabekidding: Name plates off. RJS best player in the world
[1:33:51] Ooklei: prince who LuL
[1:33:53] yanya7701: but if you can get the bo3 between C9 and NRG, its worth the time to endure the bo3 of DIG and IMT. Its not like LPL/LCK dont have their region's DIG and IMT
[1:34:01] cln2013: Guma would ROFL stomp LCS
[1:34:05] DonNardo: DonNardo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:34:06] scrapabidoopimpaff: @teetii_ Oh ok, i just wanted to like point out that lol cuting the road show of only one split of one of their smaller region is not really equivalent as halo getting a road sho for their big international event. I sitll would like a road sho for lcs sprong split too tho.
[1:34:11] enshero: Rjs catching strays man
[1:34:15] GimpyGopher: so delusional to not want bo3 lmfao
[1:34:30] blank_mcdxii: Let's DO a 3-day Brad cast with BO3 Like LEC does with 1 BO1 round-robin for team seating. (I think this is completely feasible and No one will have a problem if it is in the studio for a 2/3 split and 1 live show at the end of the year before Wordes.)
[1:34:31] Prophet181: @cln2013 guma would rofl stomp for 2 splits then decline and then become mediocre
[1:34:32] profitguru: "idk who this Gumayusi kid is, but I'm bout to shit on him" -Yeon last Worlds until that last fight
[1:34:34] X_Cape: So delusional to think that will fix all prblems

[1:41:41] teetii_: Quid was given the worst situation possible as a rookie and he got flamed so hard. he deserves massive respect tbh

[1:54:20] steph_curry_no1_fan: i think lolesports is fine. it was just 2018 to like 2020 was just hyperinflated contracts cause sponsors thought esports would become the next nba or whatever. now its just becoming sustainable

[1:55:28] yanya7701: @urgotabekidding oh
[1:55:30] chachook6: it isnt NA esports its just league
[1:55:31] boater_michael: maybe
[1:55:34] nfcpm: i love the new map
[1:55:35] iEnigmaaa: from the viewer perspective, im not quite sure the consensus is that they are holding firm

[1:55:45] yanya7701: got it
[1:55:45] X_Cape: FeelsMarkZMan
[1:55:58] Todo88: I don't care about any other esports, except maybe Starcraft. Nothing else catches me like League
[1:56:03] hellohihi145: no spring finals and lcs is fine btw
[1:56:08] yanya7701: is it larger than Valorant?
[1:56:13] ixbx: Besides baron pit changes, new maps awful
[1:56:16] hellohihi145: budget cuts and lcs isn’t dying btw
[1:56:27] teetii_: I've explored other esports scenes, and literally every scene says their league, in NA, is dying. every esport is doomer lul
[1:56:40] rudiferr: @yanya7701 Currently it's hard to say cuz NA VCT viewership includes multiple regions, not just NA
[1:56:49] trollinn69: you have to hold before you increase
[1:57:01] Lyghtsaber: ESPORTS ISNT NFL/MLB/NBA ITS FUCKING DEAD!!
[1:57:05] Lyghtsaber: kekw
[1:57:08] StuckInCoolCourt: yo travis you have to unban the word C   A    T
[1:57:12] Ikancast: that sucks, people shouldnt do that
[1:57:17] SevTST: Travis also called for CLG/NRG to be broken up quite a few times. Lol
[1:57:20] yanya7701: @rudiferr interesting
[1:57:20] iEnigmaaa: you literally kept the Core... JJ... of the team
[1:57:28] Fredthefree: I like the current TL team
[1:57:28] Maokwa: For the amount of people saying LCS ia dying, thr same if not more is being said about NA Dota2, NA Counter-Strike, etc. Community is just a bunch of doomers and its the same everywhere not just the LCS
[1:57:55] WopaPlays: in this macro environment im just glad the league still exists

[1:58:08] desemaia: LCS is most enjoyable its been in some time. still would be better with 10 teams, or just more matches
[1:58:10] ASMRLeague: What I think he is asking is should we include esports in the olympics.
[1:58:12] chachook6: how do i join hotline league?
[1:58:16] dclang: I would rather have a recent world champion in the league for a year than not at all, pyosik was hype
[1:58:17] bondance: What the fuck is this stream of consciousness take?
[1:58:17] SarahDeeGee: The rate of decline in the health of the LCS is very concerning, but it is by far the healthiest esport that is region locked to NA.
[1:58:20] Tameablebread93: ugh
[1:58:23] yanya7701: I do think esports is on a downturn this year but mostly bc of China. China's viewership is plummeting this split
[1:58:27] chachook6: its a hotline right? how does one join
[1:58:32] WopaPlays: new jeans diff

[1:59:17] numiiigoesrawrz: take: are we optimistic moving forward about the LCS?
[1:59:24] cln2013: i mean none of them can answer that honestly, they all get money via someway from LCS
[1:59:28] Prophet181: im optimistic now that we have PAGODA eggrolls in the lcs
[1:59:29] rlpavel: sotlHang
[1:59:29] iEnigmaaa: not really but i sincerely hope MarkZ works his magic.
[1:59:31] ecohfoX: I think he's trying to ask about cultural power gap - does NA LCS become more impactful than LCK as it pertains to League (?)
[1:59:45] FAZERKEX: Should Riot combine all Americas like they did with EU and MENA?
[1:59:49] Cubbyxx: @Prophet181 Travis needs the @ for this
[1:59:50] womboboys: Just combine NA and EU in one centralized place - call it a day
[1:59:51] bowenchung: League of Legends Americas
[1:59:51] Ikancast: the NA pros in valorant have complained about being combined together
[2:00:00] WopaPlays: merging Americas would just make the gameplay so much worse wouldnt it

[2:01:26] bigdigbanditto: LUL 󠀀
[2:01:26] whoa2you: @Maokwa Its not a take. Its a fact that NA youth are never going to throw themselves at video games like China does and South Korea does. Simply put because China and South Korea do not have  the Sports programs that NA has... its a Fact that NA will never be competitive in Esports
[2:01:26] a_blue_snivy: kek
[2:01:27] chachook6: HOLY FUCK @travisgafford JUST SPOKE IT. THE WHOLE NA BAD THING IS A JOKE IN EVERY OTHER ESPORT ITS THEIR OWN PEOPLE DOOMING IT

[2:01:43] bussy_bopper: pagoda egg rolls is proof lcs is unhealthy, that stuff is bad for you

[2:01:48] hellohihi145: SPAWN DOGGO
[2:01:49] bassnasty: based point by spawn. And people as someone who works in finance and looks at the economy on a daily basis.... Stop looking at this in a vacuum. Economics impacts the LCS as well
[2:01:51] hellohihi145: PLEASE
[2:02:24] Natedoggjr: Thoughts on co-streaming regional leagues?
[2:02:26] Noreason_4: not brazil
[2:02:26] SarahDeeGee: I think that consolidation was their goal at some point, but vct Americas is on a trajectory to be a failure. They had two regions that normally aren't competitive in the international level, competing and winning their worlds. Now one year in, the move to LA decimated those regions.
[2:02:27] TheCo_Operators: What's crazy, is this has felt like a great season as a viewer, leaves me wanting more each game day.
[2:02:31] Noreason_4: brazil is way more profitable than LCS
[2:02:34] WopaPlays: Not bronzil pls
[2:02:35] steph_curry_no1_fan: easiest way to kill cblol
[2:02:37] SevTST: Travis, turn around and let the dog in! Let the dog in!
[2:02:41] womboboys: Combine NA and EU or OMEGALUL
[2:02:45] Noreason_4: and they wont want to ruin the Brazil scene
[2:02:47] Ikancast: the south america pros move to LA to play
[2:02:51] rlpavel: "Are we optimistic about LCS"? Well, depends on what you mean by we and optimistic and LCS KEKW
[2:02:54] chachook6: NA is so good at every other game.... the lcs is stable.... we're just not as good as other regions but the vast amount of losers earning for importance are demanding too much and it makes the whole thing out to be joke @travisgafford
[2:02:55] AyyeKaleb: Valorant doesnt travel and its americas
[2:03:00] yanya7701: what about valorant?
[2:03:07] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:03:11] numiiigoesrawrz: i like how we see this dog on 3 diff cameras
[2:03:23] KSnOwnage: lots of TL fans in Brazil
[2:03:39] Noreason_4: brazil joining lcs is just killing brazil
[2:03:39] yanya7701: you lost to Vietnam just saying...
[2:03:39] narvuntien: It would be like LEC? with the an americas under league, we add two brazil teams to fill the missing slots
[2:03:43] Noreason_4: which at this point is much more popoular
[2:03:44] Noreason_4: than lcs
[2:03:46] bowenchung: whats the dogs name? whos dog is it?

[2:04:06] hellohihi145: there are a LOT of tl Brazil fans
[2:04:18] azynce: what if they could have relegation for the last 2 teams
[2:04:18] Lyghtsaber: @PapaSmithy u think travis knows that lmao
[2:04:20] rudiferr: But like isn't CBLOL doing better than us? How do you convince them to downsize?
[2:04:22] SevTST: And then you do BO3's?
[2:04:27] WopaPlays: this was travis's pitch to become commissioner
[2:04:33] ASMRLeague: Do you know which two it would be?
[2:04:37] narvuntien: You'd have Icurus and Rainbow7 from Latam
[2:04:39] travisgafford: @Lyghtsaber brother, I was there when it happened
[2:04:44] Omfe: NO, latam teams are so bad right now, players im not sure mechanically, but teams suck so bad (Im from latam)
[2:04:48] DamianEstrada: Goodbye Travis
[2:04:50] Fredthefree: Yeon is worried he'll be out of job, jkjkjkjkjk
[2:04:51] trollinn69: cblol has better viewership but I doubt they make more money
[2:05:00] julesSuperHD: Woulnd't NA players be able to play on the LATM or Brazilian leagues? You'd get the best players
[2:05:01] yanya7701: @Omfe cblol is not latam
[2:05:01] TheCo_Operators: Growing the league cannot just be a riot thing, that is something teams need to facilitate fan growth...
[2:05:09] Noreason_4: @trollinn69 cblol is profitable
[2:05:14] narvuntien: Which teams form Brazil
[2:05:16] cln2013: but your show comes from LCS fans, but hearing @Spawnthecaster take, I apologize, more or less I meant that you wouldnt want to say the LCS is dying cause it might impact your finacial stbality. As for travis your show is based off LCS fans, LCS does not pay you, but your income does come from having a show based on LCS. Think of it like TNT NBA Show, they arent owned by NBA, but their income comes from the viewership of the NBA
[2:05:18] narvuntien: ?
[2:05:19] TheCo_Operators: And it really doesn't seem like that is something most teams do well
[2:05:23] Omfe: @yanya7701 yeah cblol is growing good, they are getting better
[2:05:30] yanya7701: @Omfe and also TL lost to Vietnam at worlds, in a bo3
[2:05:32] Noreason_4: @cln2013 LOUD Furia Kabum Flamengo
[2:05:36] womboboys: How many new players is Riot bringing in per year. That's the only way you sustain the sport.
[2:05:40] Lyghtsaber: @travisgafford ok boomer
[2:05:40] Noreason_4: Red Canids
[2:05:42] Yeon7lol: all I heard was it was more than 14+hours
[2:05:45] Yeon7lol: from LAX to bnrazil
[2:05:48] Lyghtsaber: back in my day type beat
[2:05:48] Yeon7lol: brazil
[2:06:01] nfcpm: what would even be the difference? would brazil players not be able play on an NA team?
[2:06:02] hellohihi145: man’s worried about traveling

[2:06:31] Yeon7lol: I don't watch vct too much so I don't understand their system
[2:06:33] bustlinfungus: it sucks for br and latam at least in val
[2:06:38] NihilistGamer1: It'd be good for regional rivalries to have NA teams vs BR and LATAM teams
[2:06:42] Tactical: Yeon7lol: I don't watch vct too much so I don't understand their system
[2:06:43] PapaSpliffy: if there were no roster quotas for South American players being on teams would that not just end up being 10 NA teams because NA is a stronger region talent wise?
[2:06:43] Lyghtsaber: goodnight cubby, spawn, and yeon
[2:06:49] Omfe: Why doesnt Riot plan on pushing LCS to something more grassroots to reboot the passion for the league
[2:07:04] dclang: shit i forgot to shout out Mordew
[2:07:10] nfcpm: yeah I think an America's cup would be great

[2:08:27] nfcpm: @Cubbyxx what's the win\loss by side right now in LCS?
[2:08:37] Omfe: @bassnasty For me it would mean some sort of "high stakes" passion to play to be the best team you can
[2:08:47] sweh_t_balls: did new map kll camille for pro play?

[2:09:06] Ashar216: @Cubbyxx do you think the baron that creates a massive tunnel in the middle of the river is a good compromise for both sides?
[2:09:25] Todo88: Impact is my goat
[2:09:30] numiiigoesrawrz: take: Impact is the savior of TL and is the best top laner
[2:09:36] Cubbyxx: @Ashar216 Yes but 2nd grubs need to be stronger, grubs is a great change because it gives them a lever to balance map more towards top
[2:09:38] hellohihi145: impact is the goat
[2:09:38] Ashar216: guess it kinda punishes red side a bit, but better access than before...
[2:09:39] SevTST: I totally forgot Alphari existed.
[2:09:44] OG_Plumwick: yip yip

[2:10:21] yanya7701: isnt that KR top from IMT pretty good? I heard Dom saying hes pretty good
[2:10:24] hellohihi145: and is good for thag
[2:10:57] Ashar216: @Cubbyxx yeah agreed, I like seeing the macro and opportunity cost decisions around the trade for 1st/2nd grubs vs 1st/2nd drake
[2:10:57] SevTST: @attackonhumby Was he on Vitality for a bit when he went back to EU?
[2:11:04] SillyLittle_Guy_: @attackonhumby Vitality superteam boom

[2:13:02] chachook6: NA gotta believe they can win.. best fix possible
[2:13:43] SevTST: Well the attitude rumors got him to LCS, and they just seemed to continue all the way back to EU and then to the Vitality boom.
