[6:14:55] exuvium: @r3nt0n7 i have a question about the mejais stats, if someone sells the item and then loses does that impact the item winrate?
[6:14:59] shinyclodsire: lol
[6:15:33] call_me_teaa: @exuvium i'd say you'd need to finish the game with the mejais
[6:15:55] exuvium: yea that's what im thinking, so the item having a high winrate is just gigabiased to the point of not being useful information
[6:16:11] TwitchTime89: BANGER
[6:16:16] TwitchTime89: clubDance
[6:16:19] call_me_teaa: which is probably why "people don't build mejais" might be from the simple fact that people didn't snowball as they wished, and end up selling the item
[6:16:31] redtauro: I dedicate this song to everyone in chat
[6:16:42] call_me_teaa: (selling dark seal i mean, not mejais)
[6:16:47] r3nt0n7: @exuvium Yoo! Glad you're interested! It should be BUYING, not finishing the game
[6:17:05] r3nt0n7: @call_me_teaa lolalytics should be build order not finishing game AFAIK
[6:17:35] PsychoEm14: @exuvium It could also be because people don't buy it unless they're already ahead

[6:17:53] TwitchTime89: BirdgeArrive
[6:17:54] exuvium: @PsychoEm14 yea that's the first point i made, the item has a natural selection bias

[7:29:46] denunciator: you can have satay without peanut sauce! but it's a very common contaminant in SEA
[7:29:59] Deku_Dreaming: Stunt have u ever seen any Ghibli movies? If so which is ur fave
[7:30:17] Deku_Dreaming: Chat too
[7:30:17] i_scrub: always allergic reaction BibleThump
[7:30:18] lugubrieuzz: yea the likely cross contamination of peanuts is way too high considering the widespread use of peanut oil
[7:30:33] Ghostloon: ono
[7:30:37] zionthegod: can we turn on the video audio to?
[7:30:41] razberry10: that would kill me
[7:30:53] froggys1ime: another workout day done thanks for streaming through it Mr stunt!!
[7:30:54] EN3RU: or just lactose intollerant?
[7:30:59] corfeldt: five guys has aquarium-sized basins
[7:31:01] redtauro: gachiGASM
[7:31:04] corfeldt: filled with peanuts
[7:31:07] Pandymoanium: Chick Fil A?
[7:31:13] corfeldt: just to avoid the peanut allergy problem
[7:31:24] denunciator: HUH
[7:31:27] denunciator: what the HELL
[7:31:28] voidmoons: Erm
[7:31:31] froggys1ime: I’ve been at it for a year so I’m hoping to do more this year, I wanna get skinny
[7:31:41] corfeldt: they show off all their peanuts so you know they use peanuts
[7:31:47] zionthegod: luckily I am not allergic to anything
[7:32:01] kiberarosora: is this PBE server?
[7:32:14] blubbubb: KEKW I love how you mute everyone BEFORE picking your champ
[7:32:14] froggys1ime: I don’t think I’m allergic to anything either BUT I’ve definitely got digestion issues so all food gives me problems
[7:32:16] negraodaniel: @froggys1ime me too my man, we will do it
[7:32:19] razberry10: which sucks cause im deathly allergic to peanuts but not peanut oil

[7:33:09] Madghyr: comet?
[7:33:24] HowFoul: Wait does hob proc off the clone?
[7:33:28] Srdjan91: does hail of blades trigger on clone?
[7:33:29] r3nt0n7: grasp is good for clones
[7:33:30] negraodaniel: grasp does more damage on lane
[7:33:30] lugubrieuzz: yes u can
[7:33:38] lugubrieuzz: that's inherently the challenge
[7:33:39] denunciator: wait is it Illaoi already?
[7:33:45] redtauro: I read about this new and upcoming treatment for Allergies. They will give you an injection that will cause your body to ignore the chemical that your body is allergic to. Like instead of making your allergy go away, they will just go reverse LUL
[7:34:08] kovptr: first strike is working on spirits?

[7:36:02] zionthegod: stuntNoted put HoB on all champs. Queing HoB Ivern mid right now
[7:36:13] flowerchild_nz: @redtauro they’re testing it for monoclonal antibody therapy yeah, the idea is you kill most antibodies against that compound or amplify stabilising antibodies for that compound. It could go extremely wrong though because it’s very difficult to anticipate the reaction someone may have
[7:36:14] corfeldt: im a believer stunt
[7:36:16] negraodaniel: w first would is really nice with grasp
[7:36:19] corfeldt: youve sold me
[7:36:24] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[7:36:39] Criz7z: lumi has been doing illaoi in norms just to test and she says she likes dh lol
[7:37:20] redtauro: @flowerchild_nz it sounds so 'smart' though like you know sometimes you can't necessarily fix something permanently but you spend all  your time looking in that direction. When I read that, I was so impressed. Of course, I don't have a grasp on the subject as you do.
[7:37:24] Tulavin: sry i missed, why not first strike
[7:37:25] colaaaaaddict: jinx too tanky smoge
[7:37:51] negraodaniel: serpents fang first item?
[7:38:55] jayinthi: BibleThump we played this song at my grandpas funeral such a great song
[7:39:07] flowerchild_nz: @redtauro it totally is, it’s absolutely awesome technology. My prof is on a team that is using monoclonal antibodies to induce an allergic reaction to melanoma to kill it, so the perfect opposite to what you mentioned. The monoclonal antibody omalizumab also saved my life because it completely cured my anaphylaxis (from an autoimmune condition)
[7:39:14] negraodaniel: can go zeke for utility, really good on her
[7:39:22] negraodaniel: and is cheap
[7:39:33] Criz7z: lethality
[7:39:33] flowerchild_nz: @redtauro monoclonal antibodies are the future for sure! So cool!
[7:39:56] redtauro: @flowerchild_nz damn its being used for cancer also is amazing Pog gosh I love science lol
[7:40:13] r3nt0n7: if she can kill the tentacle, run. if she cannot kill it, do not run out
[7:40:15] Tulavin: run out i think
[7:40:20] stefenstream: I've never been in Illaoi
[7:40:21] stefenstream: Can't tell
[7:40:25] stefenstream: AYOOO
[7:40:32] fauthurs: ayo?
[7:40:35] breakmyheartpls: wtf going on in the chat today
[7:40:51] stefenstream: Missa joking :(
[7:40:52] cranberryVodkae: runnning out better so you dont take dmg from transfer Thinkge
[7:40:53] denunciator: if i recall correctly, if you hit illaoi the E duration shortens
[7:40:54] HowFoul: I thought you were gonna max e first
[7:40:54] pIasmate: stay in for sure
[7:41:03] crisafad: kinda depends tbh
[7:41:03] r3nt0n7: @denunciator nto anymore
[7:41:12] denunciator: oh when did that get changed
[7:41:19] r3nt0n7: @denunciator a long time ago unless im mistaken
[7:41:20] zionthegod: trailblazer on all champs. cause then you get a cool trail as you walk
[7:41:28] Tulavin: u can dodge tentacles pretty easy if u run out instead of staying and taking damage
[7:41:29] Tulavin: idk
[7:41:56] flowerchild_nz: @redtauro yup! Also a fact for you: pregnant mothers can develop an allergy to their foetus, causing miscarriage and still birth. We can use monoclonal antibodies to cure this allergy just like any other! Currently the condition is largely untreatable

[7:51:43] Criz7z: YES PLS

[7:54:06] Criz7z: yeah its sudden or taste
[7:54:25] Criz7z: i usually do transcendence lol
[7:54:26] kuroyami_TV: maxing Q is the best since if you grabe spirit your q deal alot if you hit both spirit and target
[7:54:30] Madghyr: go for item cd
[7:54:45] Criz7z: I like my E cd to be up :P
[7:55:07] kuroyami_TV: also if people get hit by tentacule spawn they get extra damage since q boost slam of tentacule

[7:55:47] Criz7z: its E max
[7:55:55] r3nt0n7: you want to max E if you can hit it, Q if you cannot hit e
[7:56:25] Criz7z: thats because they're not support you have someone dmging the target
[7:57:01] r3nt0n7: i'd max E if they have melee support, Q if not

[8:16:49] mo0nx: ah k
[8:17:02] haojoshi: I think it def depends on her build tho since shurelyas isn’t as good

[8:17:25] voidmoons: oh shit its still 14.2 i forgor
[8:17:48] haojoshi: @mo0nx I still build shurelyas but I build full movespeed on her because of her passive rework

[8:19:02] haojoshi: fr
[8:19:09] PrinceFuyuki: Stunt, what's a good champion to learn the support role?
[8:19:35] haojoshi: I would be so embarrassed if I was that katarina lol
[8:19:50] The_Alfies: Game feels more snowbally
[8:19:58] haojoshi: it can be pretty annoying tbh
[8:20:22] voidmoons: i think rakan or naut is good
[8:20:26] voidmoons: idk
[8:20:44] haojoshi: @voidmoons I dont ever play naut but I’d recommend those too
[8:20:47] voidmoons: naut is a bit more 1 dimensional tho
[8:20:48] PrinceFuyuki: Sure, I'll try Rakan, thank you. :3
[8:20:57] CaptainCrackz: my first was Morgan
[8:21:05] voidmoons: i like naut

[8:21:27] pekinwoofhater: xdd
[8:21:29] The_Alfies: Soraka is pretty simple.
[8:21:29] jangel143: i learned back in season 4 with lulu/sona

[8:22:56] jangel143: meaning knowing enemy champs

[8:23:00] HowFoul: Oh this is a banger
[8:23:02] haojoshi: @jangel143 in lower elo you can usually hold your Q for chases
[8:23:04] fauthurs: i dont think leonas boring
[8:23:05] jannablowsu: leona Looking
[8:23:12] blubbubb: every support main MUST have done the cowbell dance.
[8:23:13] OmegaMonsoon: dont play leona
[8:23:17] fauthurs: honestly depends on ur playstyle and what u like
[8:23:18] voidmoons: dont recommend lux as sup

[8:23:58] ClayStehling: no, but how do you feel about smolder ?
[8:23:59] PrinceFuyuki: The thing is, I have experience in every role besides support and I want to try something new to make the game more interesting.

[8:25:20] kovptr: w max janna with comet is still a thing?
[8:25:25] haojoshi: yup
[8:25:38] voidmoons: bc with senna u have to pace urself to scale effectively in the game to be relevant
[8:25:46] haojoshi: Mm hmm
[8:25:57] voidmoons: if ur not getting enough souls ur kinda just there
[8:26:07] reformedJay: NODDERS
[8:26:19] voidmoons: i think the new rift crash thing is stupid
[8:26:21] voidmoons: anyone else
[8:26:26] Toshi_kitsune: everthing goes fast yeah
[8:26:30] haojoshi: @voidmoons it’s funny to watch but ideally annoying
[8:26:31] voidmoons: its so buggy
[8:26:35] DreamingScion: Can anything ever really be too much? Ya know?
[8:26:39] ash_chiming: level 1 objective so I can have fun before fr15
[8:26:40] voidmoons: from a gameplay standpoint
[8:26:41] haojoshi: I accidentally entered rift when I was trying to walk away
[8:26:42] The_Alfies: That's called the invade lol
[8:26:44] teemowo69: :D
[8:26:46] The_Alfies: Lots of invades lately too
[8:26:57] voidmoons: more invades bc of terrain change
[8:27:04] jangel143: when the grubs were introduced i thought herald was going to be gone, so it does feel a bit too much
[8:27:04] voidmoons: its easier for blue side to invade imo
[8:27:06] Pandymoanium: There's not enough in League. I wish there was subway surfer playing somewhere in the screen.
[8:27:15] The_Alfies: Kat's been going after you a bit in teamfights
[8:27:25] haojoshi: @pandymoanium there is if you have a teammate running it down
[8:27:30] blubbubb: the dynamic has flipped a bit on SR I think, usedd to be the jungler comes to help lanes, now it's laners coming to help the jungle more
[8:27:32] haojoshi: that’s a subway surfer
[8:27:40] haojoshi: @blubbubb definitely
[8:27:52] voidmoons: i need a minecraft parkour in my league screen
[8:27:56] voidmoons: fr
[8:28:22] bibambina: wait till mcdonalds ads start popping up before objectives
[8:28:27] ash_chiming: okay the scary thing is I love those tik toks with Minecraft parkour or subway surfers 😭
[8:28:32] voidmoons: lol bard
[8:28:36] haojoshi: @bibambina eat? or take objective
[8:28:37] PancakeThePaladin: that poor guy
[8:28:41] voidmoons: @ash_chiming me too tho
[8:28:44] voidmoons: the reddit story ones
[8:28:59] ash_chiming: real
[8:29:01] CaptainCrackz: they be making me so mad sometimes tho
[8:29:06] bibambina: @haojoshi order this meal or lose objective due to not being able to see the screen :(
[8:29:08] voidmoons: why
[8:29:12] voidmoons: bc theyre split into parts?
[8:29:24] CaptainCrackz: no, like some of the stories
[8:29:27] voidmoons: oh lol
[8:29:35] haojoshi: @bibambina LOL imagine you’re in the pit and a 20 second ad starts playing and you come back to yourself in base
[8:29:54] CaptainCrackz: the rage bait one, I still watch tho 😂
[8:30:08] blubbubb: mmmmmmWELL
[8:30:15] ash_chiming: Legends of Runeterra isn’t making enough money 😭
[8:30:21] voidmoons: i like when the stories are so fake but i still watch them
[8:30:23] haojoshi: clearly not enough for them with the layoffs
[8:30:23] Toshi_kitsune: haha
[8:30:24] jannablowsu: enough pepegeHmm
[8:30:29] HowFoul: Did riot do layoffs?
[8:30:31] melasi: tech in general having a lot of layoffs because of ai and such
[8:30:41] jannablowsu: can you ever make enough pepegeHmm
[8:30:44] voidmoons: they laid off like ~530 ppl
[8:31:12] loonaa: morning
[8:31:19] RealGabiwan: @melasi what does ai have to do with it in tech?
[8:31:23] mo0nx: why would they need talented people when they can train an AI instead that's free. ^^'
[8:31:27] ash_chiming: at Nintendo the CEO took a pay cut after the 3DS came out
[8:31:50] ash_chiming: and failed horribly
[8:31:58] Toshi_kitsune: ai will fix alot of things in few years everteverything going to change
[8:32:06] jannablowsu: chat gpt writing the lore
[8:32:09] blubbubb: I think it's still baby steps for AI
[8:32:18] mo0nx: it seems to be the occuring thing this past year , people losing jobs to it
[8:32:24] aaraferty: is it really AI though
[8:32:27] jannablowsu: urgot has a dark and mysterious past
[8:32:28] blubbubb: if I were a business owner, I would wait a bit till it's more... solid? reliable?
[8:32:37] mo0nx: and a lot of folks praising the AI without even knowing what it does
[8:32:38] zokeoh: pretty sure during covid there were a ton of tech boom and it died down a bit
[8:32:42] haojoshi: they were starting to look for a way to regulate it
[8:32:42] ash_chiming: depending on chatGPT sounds like a terrible idea rn
[8:32:44] kiberarosora: pokemon go company niantic cut over 25% of their company
[8:32:46] Toshi_kitsune: i hope will not be something better then ai
[8:32:51] HowFoul: @stunt which league champ do you think has the best lore
[8:33:05] RealGabiwan: @mo0nx Are you actually in tech? :)
[8:33:06] aaraferty: @blubbubb money is made from innovation and riding that wave can go either way
[8:33:11] jannablowsu: bard my beloved :3
[8:33:30] blubbubb: I remember seeing some AI generated product names on Amazon that have part of the product name and then "I'm sorry I cannot fulfil this request as it is too blablabla"
[8:33:40] ash_chiming: yone ult 😭
[8:34:08] flamefire38: am i the only one that thinks smolder is super strong
[8:34:10] mo0nx: @RealGabiwan if ur gonna follow up with something defensive to AI save it, I'm an artist and I can tell you that I do not support AI for obvious reasons
[8:34:14] haojoshi: I really like Camille’s lore
[8:34:17] Criz7z: Ow!
[8:34:30] ash_chiming: @mo0nx real
[8:34:30] zokeoh: slicko
[8:34:40] haojoshi: oh I used to be obsessed with one direction really badly
[8:34:41] blubbubb: @aaraferty oh absolutely, I agree 100%
[8:34:45] RiftJockel: BEST LANE EVER :D
[8:34:49] RealGabiwan: @mo0nx no no, I just cannot reason the layoffs with AI developments, especially in tech.

[8:35:55] DreamingScion: I work in Ai. It's also important to note that most people get their Ai info from articles and click bait videos trying to sell a story cause it helps their revenue.
[8:35:56] haojoshi: you’re scary stunt, buying a mejais with 0 stacks
[8:36:11] PrinceFuyuki: WHOLETHIMBOOK
[8:36:13] Furiusl: Smolder in late game
[8:36:23] DreamingScion: As it would happen, most people who write articles are not qualified to interpret actual research.
[8:36:23] Criz7z: That;s an AI
[8:36:24] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[8:36:25] Criz7z: LOL

[8:36:34] Criz7z: @DreamingScion you're an AI >.>
[8:36:42] voidmoons: theyre not
[8:36:44] Criz7z: :d
[8:36:45] DreamingScion: @Criz7z How do you know you're not?
[8:36:50] voidmoons: ive seen them here before

[8:38:01] haojoshi: lol
[8:38:02] avuloseunda: @voidmoons you're one of the most brilliant woman i know :3
[8:38:03] mo0nx: @RealGabiwan you don't even need to be good to use AI, so long as you have a source to train it with, stable difusion for instance can be trained to replicate an artist's work accurately and create new scenes. If you can use 1 AI program to make a lot of art from refferences then you dont need to pay a bunch of artists, maybe just a few to keep the source original, I would imagine that's how a company would approach it
[8:38:06] HowFoul: Oh jannas slow and nasus slow has to be so annoying to play against
