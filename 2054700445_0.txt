[1:19:24] lilchompero: How much AP do you have?
[1:20:13] Pitju99: prolly around 800
[1:21:34] xxpops: skill shot
[1:21:36] belaruski_ninja_spy: its his q
[1:21:47] Fun5Play: @ipav999 coz he dmg skillshot, not auto
[1:22:13] Fun5Play: like ezreal
[1:22:38] xxpops: he is mostly ap scaling, so kog, ez, etc
[1:23:42] SunnyDaBunny: lost game
[1:26:24] Pitju99: I joined late but from what I've seen, your team rly didnt deserve this win
[1:26:25] Fun5Play: jax shop so funny\
[1:26:34] xxpops: no one had anti heal
[1:28:04] Pitju99: and lucian had it anyway
[1:28:14] xxpops: milio aoe heal end game is pretty big
[1:28:26] xxpops: and he has redemption, idk
[1:29:10] Pitju99: your ori was really behind too, she was almost at rabadon
[1:30:01] xxpops: kayne had anti-shield for killing smolder but didnt really go on him
[1:30:34] twitchonipadpro: may i ask why no ban? what about malphit is he no good anymore?
[1:30:47] metallio: early game is strong this season
[1:30:48] twitchonipadpro: sorry if its a dumb question
[1:31:16] twitchonipadpro: hahaha that’s awesome
[1:31:38] twitchonipadpro: i wish i could say that lol
[1:32:59] xxpops: same, it was competitive
[1:33:02] metallio: ya true at least they last long enough to enjoy.
[1:33:39] metallio: downloading something lol
[1:35:26] Pitju99: 50% of games ended between minute 30-35 last patch
[1:35:39] Pitju99: but thats prolly through all tiers
[1:36:39] RinaRinaki: I think all mages havent so dmg to kill tanks with full mr, maybe only adc
[1:37:00] Pitju99: and for each 25 min game theres a 40 min one
[1:39:04] Pitju99: getting all the kills
[1:39:48] Pitju99: meowkai doesnt have too much cs lol
[1:41:05] Jessyhigh: <3
[1:41:49] Mouadessa: positive yasuo
[1:42:39] Suicidallangel: !build
[1:43:43] Charming_Chimken: nice
[1:43:45] lenouaille: ipav so gooood
[1:44:28] Suicidallangel: how is the build going did we find it out?
[1:47:13] Pitju99: problem is lux and draven ult on your stasis
[1:47:42] Cofferal: does hear this music globally or just your team?
[1:48:08] Mikemonkeyz: didnt know that bgm was a thing.. that was actually pretty cool
[1:51:30] minniethesooh: hello miser ipav how goes your stream today
[1:52:32] SushyHD: !elo
[1:53:29] SushyHD: !opgg
[1:54:22] minniethesooh: what is your opinion on smolder?
[1:54:47] RinaRinaki: void or morello is good in this game?
[1:55:00] SushyHD: Hi ! I'm new to your stream :) What's your current elo ?
[1:55:04] minniethesooh: wait smolder only has 137 stacks at 22:30, it's over
[1:55:28] minniethesooh: i think teemo is too popular to throw away like that
[1:56:00] TownsyHD: Whoa Caleb?
[1:56:10] TownsyHD: Caley*?
[1:56:30] Pitju99: but reworking generates way less income than making a new champion
[1:56:43] LtChezo: @TownsyHD kayle
[1:57:23] Pitju99: it's a no brainer for them
[1:57:57] minniethesooh: you say that but ryze got 18 reworks
[1:58:05] minniethesooh: and teemo is one of their cash cows
[1:59:51] minniethesooh: your smolder doesn't know how to stack LUL
[1:59:54] Suicidallangel: nice dive pantheon dive
[2:01:24] minniethesooh: i think average time for smolder to be max stack is 24 mins
[2:02:04] Pitju99: NA Master/GM avg game length is 27 mins, idk about last season
[2:02:19] Pitju99: but I think it was a minute or 2 less
[2:03:07] Pitju99: even challenger its still 26 30
[2:03:09] thegreatone188: Who is stronger - asol or smold
[2:03:18] minniethesooh: probably asol LUL
[2:03:46] thegreatone188: But smolder can call his mom LUL
[2:04:06] minniethesooh: they both fly the same
[2:04:21] minniethesooh: they compared it and asol is stronger until smolder hits max stack
[2:05:07] minniethesooh: yea asol can only go in a straight line as well
[2:05:16] banhammer4u: Actually asol is still stronger given the same time to stack
[2:05:37] minniethesooh: it's the mini elder buff on smolder
[2:05:43] minniethesooh: that makes it better at max stack
[2:06:30] banhammer4u: Haven't had a game yet with less than 20% max execute on asol.
[2:06:32] MentorasC: no LUL
[2:06:45] MentorasC: teemooooo
[2:06:46] minniethesooh: draven already tilted LUL
[2:06:50] banhammer4u: Lol
[2:07:42] Pitju99: Draven don't be mad challenge: impossible
[2:07:54] banhammer4u: And having both on the same team is hilarious, but you don't get the quest that way
[2:09:27] Pitju99: onetricks can work around those weaknesses well, I see multiple nasus onetricks get high challenger
[2:09:33] Pitju99: you never know
[2:09:46] minniethesooh: yea i think so too, seeing him bot just feels like a free lane pressure
[2:09:53] minniethesooh: against him
[2:10:25] MyckaT: hes talking about skaling champs, kayle feels fine in high tier
[2:11:08] Pitju99: yeah thats true
[2:11:15] minniethesooh: just because it "works" doesn't mean it's "good"
[2:11:29] Pitju99: I'm just saying it's not necessarily a bad champion, just needs a lot of experience
[2:12:15] MyckaT: i've watching bauusfss, hes gating kayle champs fomr time to time
[2:12:28] minniethesooh: i remember last split, i needed one more win to hit master and mister ipav ended up on my team Kappa
[2:12:33] Pitju99: I think Kayle is worse than nasus in high tier tho
[2:12:37] minniethesooh: he carried my ass
[2:12:44] Pitju99: Nasus has ways to buff his early
[2:13:17] minniethesooh: nasus is a little different since he can flex either ap or ad
[2:13:47] minniethesooh: tahm ghosting LUL
[2:15:13] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[2:17:23] Pitju99: I can see that
[2:18:00] Pitju99: akali doesnt count though her dmg is illegal
[2:19:45] metalwrath22222: how does he see
[2:20:33] MyckaT: kayle was picked 7 times in s14 tournaments
[2:20:37] Pitju99: uh oh LUL
[2:20:41] xxpops: he will be unkillable if go ap
[2:20:51] xxpops: jihn cant kill a tahm
[2:21:30] Pitju99: I think you could have lived if you didnt try to invis
[2:21:48] metalwrath22222: f
[2:21:57] fraggleroctv: hes still killable now?.. next back he will be unkillable i think
[2:22:55] Pitju99: nidalee ganking shitmo without cc
[2:22:58] Pitju99: LUL
[2:23:21] minniethesooh: what do you think is the hardest matchup for teemo?
[2:23:30] metalwrath22222: wow guys what a balanced champ
[2:23:36] txvnd: LUL
[2:23:42] Kenwood502: kidnapped
[2:23:52] Pitju99: he cant land it
[2:24:14] thegreatone188: Swiftness is so god vs his slow on q
[2:24:15] Pitju99: rat LUL
[2:24:17] Kenwood502: no AD teemo?
[2:25:14] Pitju99: you did just get doublekilled under his turret
[2:25:23] Pitju99: so this game not a great sample to judge
[2:25:57] antroz92: lol
[2:26:02] antroz92: tip denied
[2:26:57] metalwrath22222: F
[2:27:32] metalwrath22222: someone tell me how this is balanced
[2:27:40] pandasquadron69: wtf
[2:28:03] Pitju99: monkaS
[2:28:12] pandasquadron69: the kench needs to be benched
[2:28:14] antroz92: bro lol
[2:28:21] thegreatone188: Looks like this big ugly frog is hungry
[2:29:07] antroz92: u dont buy the 150/500g pots?
[2:29:50] Pitju99: @antroz92 500 is never good and 150 if you can afford it with starting items
[2:30:13] Pitju99: like dark seal or boots
[2:31:08] Pitju99: maybe phase rush is too important idk
[2:31:12] Pitju99: this matchup
[2:31:23] Pitju99: could be
[2:31:33] metalwrath22222: F
[2:31:39] antroz92: f NOOOO
[2:32:06] Pitju99: also this guy went phase rush too thats smart.
[2:32:32] Pitju99: grasp tahm would be a lot easier
[2:33:20] DaJevil: Top diff
[2:33:25] Pitju99: I feel like tahms a onetrick
[2:34:13] nexi_____: KEKW
[2:34:15] metalwrath22222: tahm who got 50 ganks
[2:34:20] DaJevil: But not good enough lol
[2:34:45] RinaRinaki: toxic players, sadly
[2:34:48] Pitju99: he is mad
[2:34:50] antroz92: u coudlve flashe the wall into tribush
[2:35:44] metalwrath22222: he tped to his shadow
[2:35:48] Sak0w: I think vi and tham ulted zed at the same time
[2:36:45] metalwrath22222: shrugFace
[2:37:53] 44krieger: teemo carry
[2:38:02] 44krieger: decisive carry
[2:38:10] DaJevil: Ez carry
[2:39:13] Pitju99: you can look at it like this, this guy was good at tahm kench and you misplayed
[2:39:35] Pitju99: next time could be worse tahm with you playing better
[2:40:07] Pitju99: yeah FeelsBadMan
[2:40:33] Pitju99: get challenger fast and swap your style back maybe
[2:42:24] Pitju99: or if its rly unfun you might burn you out and don't force it
[2:42:28] TheZufra: F
[2:42:29] 291x: xddteemo
[2:42:31] Pitju99: only u can tell
[2:43:00] Shanierd513: Maybe ms or tenacity rune VS kench?
[2:43:29] Shanierd513: With phase idk
[2:45:27] Pitju99: is challenger worth having less fun for the climb duration worth it for u
[2:45:33] Pitju99: thats the question
[2:46:12] Pitju99: more or less
[2:46:51] t0ukhy: Whats ur rank ivan?

[3:03:30] PROPER_: goog morning, what are we testing now ?
[3:04:14] PROPER_: ok
[3:09:35] ChocolateMilkz: what if you included magical boots
[3:10:05] teemolingus: @ipav999 swifty boots?
[3:10:55] Pitju99: what you have to consider too is what you would take instead of celerity or the ms rune
[3:11:02] Pitju99: so oppurtunity cost
[3:11:11] Pitju99: runes are not supposed to be too impactful
[3:12:01] Pitju99: I mean the others can be pretty minimal too I just mesn u have to compare
[3:13:34] Pitju99: it could make the diff sometimes
[3:15:06] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj

[3:16:10] Pitju99: she gets ms for free
[3:16:14] Pitju99: and a lot
[3:17:59] Pitju99: boots are one of the most efficient items in league
[3:18:40] Pitju99: pros rush t2 boots insanely often on a lot of champs
[3:20:14] razer_mon: ipavCrying

[3:28:40] Pitju99: wonder why
[3:29:28] Pitju99: not burning against tree as well
[3:29:30] Shanierd513: Does 3 ticks of shrooms pop phase rush or is shroom just 1 tick?
[3:30:06] Pitju99: just 1
[3:30:15] Shanierd513: Thx
[3:30:28] Pitju99: actually maybe its 0 im not sure
[3:30:36] Pitju99: but not 3
[3:31:16] SpringSong: that flash was something
[3:31:20] Zyrophante: what the heck
[3:31:22] NotASkiller: lol
[3:31:34] akteemo: ff
[3:32:24] DrKixx: 7m ocean huge
[3:32:39] Pitju99: we need press the phase harvest
[3:32:47] Pitju99: only taimo can take it
[3:33:40] SpringSong: ur team kinda screwed you
[3:33:43] ashdeath: everyone enjoys screwing your lane
[3:34:08] 4mpatlatan: oh skibidi syndrome guy
[3:35:53] Pitju99: some marchups you cant run just have to kill the dude
[3:35:56] Pitju99: like maokai
[3:38:20] Skall77: 2 level down Awkward
[3:39:55] YuKiAj_3: mao is just busted lol
[3:40:12] Pitju99: hes not busted top thats for sure
[3:40:27] seppi2g: Taimo
[3:40:31] YuKiAj_3: 56% winrate
[3:40:35] Pitju99: in support
[3:40:55] YuKiAj_3: top 53%
[3:41:39] Pitju99: I bet his pickrate for top is low though
[3:42:34] YuKiAj_3: still op af need a heavy nerf
[3:42:54] SpringSong: mid smolder makes no sense to me
[3:43:11] DontFeedPenguins: mid smolder is better than bot
[3:43:18] DontFeedPenguins: his range is so low
[3:43:21] SpringSong: every stupid low tier watchs high tier mid smolder and they think I can play him like they do
[3:43:53] Pitju99: theres a few streamers like nemesis and midbeast that bring every new champ mid no matter what
[3:43:59] Pitju99: good or not
[3:44:06] Pitju99: idk if smolder mid is good just sayin
[3:44:07] SpringSong: champs early game is trash af so champ like akali mid sylas zoe ori azir gona fck ur team up
[3:44:17] OmgItsBrian: Draven came in quick
[3:44:34] KingDaimao: KEKW team
[3:44:40] Pitju99: and ppl watch those streams
[3:45:31] seppi2g: young smolder
[3:46:48] KingDaimao: LUL
[3:49:25] b3nz3ra: stonk maokai
[3:49:30] akteemo: FUnmo
[3:49:39] Mallocake: I love if when they say type again and I will afk and then they dont afk haha
[3:50:34] SpringSong: staying afk useless
[3:50:37] akteemo: My gpu overheated and i sent riot a picture of the melted power unit and still got banned for afk they are not playing around anymore
[3:51:02] SpringSong: I mean if he stay af he'll get report at least 4 but if walks and bein shit in teamfight it way easy to lose a game
[3:51:33] Pitju99: @akteemo couldve been someone else's gpu but yea
[3:52:00] Pitju99: unfortunate
[3:52:25] akteemo: @Pitju99 Its  a Real thing now tho I dont think riot is clowning with Afk anymore at all
[3:53:14] Pitju99: I assume u used to afk before that played a part in it
[3:53:24] Pitju99: i dont think theyd ban first time
[3:53:30] akteemo: @Pitju99 NOpe first time Afk game didnt even load
[3:53:45] Pitju99: hmm
[3:53:55] SpringSong: I mean I dont think they changed anything
[3:54:04] SpringSong: yesterday I had 0 18 feeder
[3:54:10] SpringSong: and he is still not banned
[3:54:12] akteemo: I honestly think a afk is better then feeding and inting
[3:54:33] SpringSong: it depends
[3:54:56] Pitju99: it depends whether its real "int" or just playing bad
[3:55:00] SpringSong: I mean if you have 0/5 maokai and he land a good R W in teamfight
[3:55:04] metalwrath22222: riot ban system doesn work
[3:55:14] metalwrath22222: my account should have been banned 10 times by now
[3:55:21] metalwrath22222: I inted and flamed so many games
[3:55:30] akteemo: @metalwrath22222 I stoped counting how many bans i have had after 5
[3:55:38] SpringSong: I flame and cursed too many time too
[3:56:04] Pitju99: @mallocake but see u admit that youve had a history with bans, they probably are stricter on u
[3:56:07] Pitju99: because of that
[3:56:29] SpringSong: but never willingly int and never afk still flame and curse must be reason to get at least chat ban tho
[3:57:01] SpringSong: but I still didnt get any ban
[3:57:01] Pitju99: sorry meant to direct that at aktemeo

[3:57:58] SpringSong: nothing is perfect except art team
[3:58:17] SpringSong: balance team is bad af
[3:58:23] metalwrath22222: art team isnt perfect, all the skin splasharts look the same
[3:58:43] Pitju99: art team is biased towards the asian audience but at least theyre competent
[3:59:17] SpringSong: I mean arcane music and cinematic
[3:59:18] Pitju99: its not their fault tho
[3:59:21] SpringSong: not skins
[3:59:31] SpringSong: I never buy skins idc about it
[3:59:35] Pitju99: from a business standpoint they have to cater to asia
[3:59:57] Pitju99: oh yea their music and cinema team are good
[4:00:15] SpringSong: but especially balance team horrible
[4:00:20] SpringSong: like that stupid tanks

[4:05:07] razer_mon: NO
[4:05:14] iMystogan: with mana regen rune
[4:06:07] Pitju99: maybe conditioning instead of 2nd wind
[4:06:11] Pitju99: its hard to say
[4:06:15] SpringSong: what if we dont focus on mainly dmg? more tank items? but this time why we dont play proper tank than right?
[4:06:26] SpringSong: taimo enjoyer bein sucks
[4:06:44] Pitju99: yea irs greedy i know
[4:07:04] Pitju99: I agree this is the best for lane by far
[4:07:12] Pitju99: but conditioning scaling is nice

[6:17:08] Pitju99: well fappy can do it right? similar ms
[6:17:27] Pitju99: yeah sure
[6:17:27] GrylloBH: another dodge?
[6:17:33] seriquest: yeah try dodging Voli-Q :D
[6:20:09] zefrance90: If Riot change teemo q so that it can pop teemo shrooms will teemo be op?
[6:20:28] zefrance90: Wait theres addsss
[6:20:33] Pitju99: @zefrance90 how would that even work
[6:20:52] zefrance90: Yeah you just q the shrooms and the shrooms booms
[6:21:03] Pitju99: but like
[6:21:03] zefrance90: Eh shroom not shrooms
[6:21:30] zefrance90: @ipav999 If Riot change teemo q so that it can pop teemo shrooms will teemo be op?
[6:21:32] leagueoflegoboy99: ipav . what about taking the ability haste rune and double hp with the heartsteal tanky teemo build ?
[6:21:36] Pitju99: shroom already pops when they're on it, if it pops when theyre not on it whats the point
[6:22:11] Pitju99: heartsteel is really bad right now
[6:22:16] seriquest: @zefrance90 how about binding it to the E-ability :D its a passive nowadays :D
[6:22:38] zefrance90: @pitju99 but the aoe huge so it can act as a teemo barrel
[6:22:49] Koupps: I'm excited for his visual rework tho
[6:22:49] Pitju99: it's not that huge at all
[6:22:51] zefrance90: Gankplank barrel sorry
[6:22:54] zefrance90: Xdd
[6:22:59] Pitju99: GP barrel is so mujch bigger
[6:23:00] Koupps: glad riot is paying a little attention to our yourdle
[6:23:10] Pitju99: and you can connect barrels
[6:23:17] Pitju99: which is why its even good
[6:23:36] Pitju99: you can't connect shrooms, shroom bounce is more of a meme
[6:23:43] zefrance90: Well its a cool feature to have so they dont need to really steps on it
[6:23:56] zefrance90: Which is suck for teemo players
[6:23:58] Pitju99: they could maybe increase shroom explode hitbox
[6:24:05] Pitju99: but no weird combo thing
[6:24:09] Pitju99: just buff shroom radius
[6:24:18] zefrance90: @pitju99 the aoe is already huge
[6:24:20] Pitju99: but they just nerfed teemo shroom so they wont do that
[6:24:30] Koupps: I don't think they wanna buff teemo, they nerfed him 2 times in a row, and in a hotfix too
[6:24:39] torakaka: no more tankmo?
[6:25:03] Shanierd513: They just nerfed shrooms.i don't think they are gonna buff them any time soon lol
[6:28:03] Pitju99: oh his Q has DRX written in it thsats cool
[6:29:45] Koupps: I loved the DRX skins, really nice artwork
[6:30:43] Mikkelwolf: sick Pog

[6:46:46] razer_mon: smolder needs a bit of  buff
[6:46:47] razer_mon: imo
[6:46:52] GrylloBH: samira with the major shutdown
[6:48:24] GrylloBH: @razer_mon it's strong enough late game, maybe an early game one

[6:52:22] Koupps: bossfight music POGGERS
[6:53:37] WysperXD: oh, this music turns the Taimo gameplay more intense
[6:55:10] 514484: why is that music there?
[6:55:39] Koupps: It's adaptative music, for when you fight baron, but it's bugged and got perma
[6:57:10] Shanierd513: Amumu 1v9
[6:57:54] GrylloBH: amumu keeps going in way to deep
[6:58:11] YolkBun: MYAAA

[7:01:17] Koupps: his scaling is crazy
[7:01:43] GrylloBH: and he is so hard to pin down
[7:02:27] YolkBun: Smoge ggs
[7:02:37] GrylloBH: lee and mumu kept going in instead of just trying to peel

[7:04:28] 514484: me lee sin me attac
[7:04:35] WysperXD: hahaha
[7:05:50] Koupps: he kicked ekko too, the only one that can actually just get back
[7:05:58] 514484: LUL
[7:06:46] 514484: might be fine with aatrox
[7:08:49] 514484: the red trinket isn't supposed to reveal you, wtf replay
[7:09:06] DontFeedPenguins: unlucky
[7:09:12] razer_mon: no it does
[7:09:14] razer_mon: reveal
[7:09:20] 514484: ah yes i mixed it with red ward
[7:10:50] xLeSeigneurBalekx: yes
[7:10:51] stray90: I think so
[7:10:52] 514484: sometimes maligma, sometimes not EZ
[7:11:26] xLeSeigneurBalekx: accept yourself, you'r a support
[7:12:15] razer_mon: Stleam over peepoSad
[7:12:22] xLeSeigneurBalekx: well nash helps you not wasting shroom on wave
[7:12:29] xLeSeigneurBalekx: and help early for split and 1v1
[7:12:58] xLeSeigneurBalekx: it loose alot after for TF since you can't rly dps well and your gameplay shift to shroom
[7:13:24] xLeSeigneurBalekx: i'v seen that Nashor is a worst item DMG wise than Sorc boost for Shroom, it's crazy
[7:13:59] stray90: if not playng nashor, lichbane is forced imo
[7:14:15] stray90: or aa becomes useless
[7:14:24] cuscus9214: reason why shrooms hurt is what u build for
[7:14:50] cuscus9214: hg banshee give 240ap
[7:15:11] xLeSeigneurBalekx: tank with rookern
[7:15:12] Nightbot: iPav's Full Match: https://rb.gy/rshgq iPav's Short Vid: https://rb.gy/83qxl iPav's VODs: https://rb.gy/3vpqj
[7:15:13] xLeSeigneurBalekx: kek
[7:15:36] cuscus9214: no
[7:15:50] cuscus9214: them not walking up
[7:15:54] cuscus9214: no dmg
[7:15:58] cuscus9214: they walk up
[7:16:03] cuscus9214: they bleed
[7:16:14] Shanierd513: Just pray enemy team is bad or pray you don't have that Lee and amumu on your team. Either way is pure luck
[7:16:18] cuscus9214: play assassin
[7:16:23] cuscus9214: WutFace
[7:16:32] xLeSeigneurBalekx: trap build is random and empty dmg
[7:16:39] cuscus9214: well.... u can do protobelt in
[7:16:45] xLeSeigneurBalekx: but the others build arnt that great either
[7:17:30] xLeSeigneurBalekx: you can shred tank with on hit rly quick with Lethal > bork>guinso ect
[7:17:56] razer_mon: i think the lee is yasuo player
[7:18:00] xLeSeigneurBalekx: but you'r still super squishy and taking frontline spot
[7:18:35] cuscus9214: u can ask tyg(ex fappy) some insight
[7:18:56] cuscus9214: hi, sup, how's season so far
[7:19:57] xLeSeigneurBalekx: Shroom build full cdr is super cheap tho compared to full AP
[7:20:06] ParkingSeal: Basically have to stay hidden (in passive, say) UNTIL they get hit by it
[7:20:24] ParkingSeal: ...or wait it out, teleport from hidden etc. Kappa
[7:20:39] 514484: agreed, just take PTA and then as an option Maligma for control
[7:20:49] 514484: but full commit shroom is a supprot build
[7:20:51] ParkingSeal: ..'cos this is solo q (and CAN'T rely on team)
[7:21:35] 514484: I think Maligma is really good as an option but makes full shroom worse
[7:22:20] cuscus9214: Tee R You
[7:23:34] cuscus9214: little does Pav know, Teemo R longer cd than Shen MyAvatar
[7:23:57] cuscus9214: 150 maybe

[7:26:14] cuscus9214: need to fix that
[7:26:21] Shanierd513: Shaco
[7:26:23] cuscus9214: make his shrooms a basic ability
[7:26:34] cuscus9214: shaco W is less than a minute
[7:26:38] cuscus9214: shroom is 4
[7:26:50] Shanierd513: True
[7:27:03] cuscus9214: shaco is a jester
[7:27:09] cuscus9214: teemo real deal
[7:27:11] cuscus9214: GoatEmotey
[7:28:19] GrylloBH: too big a minion stack LUL
[7:29:44] GrylloBH: he's canceled so many autos LUL
