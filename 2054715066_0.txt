[2:55:40] hesselontour: Playing league is on the same level as wasting time on tiktok tbh
[2:55:43] ericmoorefield: lets be friends <3
[2:55:44] brittleboneswr: people who are ambitious but lazy are the worst
[2:55:49] chaot3ch: My ambition is to live an easy life
[2:55:56] nisoteric34: its hard to find goals goddammit NotCrying
[2:56:00] duyiiiii: NotCrying

[2:56:17] cupoftea1111: you would be doing tiktok :)
[2:56:19] dandrg: but waiting the next pay check might not be a bad thing tho,lol
[2:56:20] brittleboneswr: @TherapyG3R be better Stare
[2:56:20] xExuberantx: @SwiftSlicerX Oh shit, hit the nail
[2:56:32] blackeli9: You are overthinking it, dude. Try just to enjoy and life will be more easy, everyone have qualities and can offer something.
[2:56:36] who________________asked_: So u want to leech
[2:56:51] Knijz: if it was no league cowsep would be doing the cringy tiktok dance
[2:56:54] yottabitey: is Terminus and Jak'Sho on Yi?
[2:56:55] xExuberantx: I think a lot of people are missing the fact the Cowsep is a bit of psycho (and I don't mean to offend), so our arguments dont get to him
[2:56:58] Knijz: or onlyfans
[2:57:00] nisoteric34: so how do i get ambition? Hmm
[2:57:15] nisoteric34: NotCrying
[2:57:18] cupoftea1111: go join a gym, those people are ambitious usually
[2:57:22] KidslnAfrica: ambitious people are all cooking at home, no time for friends
[2:57:37] are_noob: @nisoteric34 find something u dream of doing , and make a small plan and that plan grows
[2:57:39] inkstain_animations: my ambition is becoming a super popular animator 🤷‍♂️ im constantly working toward that
[2:57:41] lcry2Rtn: thats a big problem you have. just because you dont approve of their goals it doesn't mean its not important to them. If you take a step back and have a look at what youre doing someone out might say that your ambitions are not important either.
[2:57:56] nisoteric34: @are_noob i have no dream of doing anything tho Hmm
[2:57:59] SwiftSlicerX: Ahh so hard grinders in any venture they make
[2:58:08] LaatiMafia: Cowsep doesn't like 95% of his audience Sadge
[2:58:11] blackeli9: @xexuberantx I think it's depression, no offense. Over thinking it's a bad habit

[2:59:06] yottabitey: I continue to practice Yi and I've improved a lot in watching your gameplays, I started last season Bronze I and now I'm Plat II
[2:59:12] dandrg: even if it's a9-5 with a pay check?lol
[2:59:27] lcry2Rtn: You're not friends with someone because of their goals, you're friends with someone because you have something to in common to share. And that's quite surface level if you think about it.
[2:59:35] funky_pantss: I think players who are in iron elo since that elo came out and can't get out and still play the game, are I think addicted. @Cowsep
[2:59:40] velkooz2002: you fcking plqying yi you shouldn’t talk
[2:59:40] blackeli9: @cowsep do you consider yourself I depression mate? No offense
[2:59:42] dandrg: yeah,my point proven
[2:59:44] dandrg: haha
[3:00:01] Memew: "Some of my best friends have paychecks"
[3:00:03] teabox03: 9-5 in Google is different than regular 9-5
[3:00:09] chaot3ch: Sometimes I feel like I just have too many goals and accomplish none of them :)
[3:00:10] mohhgamerr: @velkooz2002 so?
[3:00:13] MigSlayer: the dollar replaced the tribe, now it has to be searched for instead of being the default, games simulate it. and the real world is the game rn.
[3:00:17] dandrg: that's the same for me, i have only 1 friend left from when i was 20
[3:00:27] yottabitey: I continue to practice Yi and I've improved a lot in watching your gameplays, I started last season Bronze I and now I'm Plat II
[3:00:27] funky_pantss: and still blames everyone else except themself even after this long, is weird to me
[3:00:37] Dansy8611: Google is a corporate monster blocking searchable sites
[3:00:42] dandrg: venoshi,yeah,i watched him a bit
[3:00:46] xExuberantx: @Cowsep so there is no chit-chat during friend meetings, only shop-talk and plans of taking over the wolrd?
[3:00:46] velkooz2002: press q and wait until late game win gg
[3:00:49] KidslnAfrica: @teabox03 ikr,  9-5 in construction is a whole different beast
[3:00:59] ghosterath: @Cowsep Whats ur new build? Titanic > Rageblade then what?
[3:01:01] dandrg: he's more into youtube clips
[3:01:25] inkstain_animations: @velkooz2002 your life revolves around league if you listened to this conversation and took THAT from it. get some life aspirations outside of your room
[3:01:27] armyparker91: what about friends in the military?
[3:01:33] teabox03: So you're like Griffith
[3:01:44] teabox03: We're gatz
[3:01:52] are_noob: u think they would make no-code tools for game development @Cowsep
[3:02:10] blackeli9: Well, signs of depression are when you overthink and judge others. You should focus on self-improvement and attract more people on your level, energy and way of seeing life
[3:02:15] brunchmenus: I like my shadow being part of my hitbox
[3:02:16] ZeptionT: what about chatting about their daily life, their love life etc
[3:02:17] dandrg: you just want friends that are pro active with their life
[3:02:27] LaatiMafia: I like patting brunchmenus
[3:02:28] lcry2Rtn: Yeah but that comes from being actual real friends with them. The relationship exists not because they have something to offer you.
[3:02:29] LaatiMafia: !pat brunchmenus owo
[3:02:29] StreamElements: LaatiMafia gives brunchmenus owo a pat on the head. 1241 pats have been given in total.
[3:02:31] KidslnAfrica: How do streamers get past streaming for 0 viewers? Must be weird knowing they're talking to themselves
[3:02:46] brunchmenus: widepeepoHappy
[3:02:49] funky_pantss: what about pro league players? They have goals.
[3:02:50] xExuberantx: @blackeli9 Yeaaah, but depression can also come from being too introspective and thinking about yourself too much
[3:02:54] nisoteric34: YOLO
[3:02:58] ZeptionT: @KidslnAfrica @Cowsep how did you get past 0 viewers?
[3:03:00] dandrg: yo,that's what i did, i quit the military after 1 year tho cause it's just better to be free,lol
[3:03:04] ZeptionT: really interesting question
[3:03:04] Knijz: it is bad tho KEKW
[3:03:30] armyparker91: I am in for the career its what ive always wanted to do been in for 11 years and have many goals to continue to progress in rank and take advantage of what the army offers me
[3:03:35] Th3Attacker: hey bro you've been playing some league? what champion you main in now days, yeah man my team kinda suck too
[3:03:36] lcry2Rtn: Grass is greener where you water it, so start building relatioships.
[3:03:43] blackeli9: @xexuberantx not abou think of yourself rather self-improvement and being able to give others when you are at peace with yourself
[3:03:56] nisoteric34: @lcry2Rtn so i need to piss on people? Hmm
[3:04:05] oOnuris: !build

[3:04:18] xExuberantx: @Cowsep see I went to college for logistics, cause I had no other ideas. But expecting an 18 year old to have their life goals figured out seems like a pipe dream
[3:04:21] chaot3ch: Right now I've got my masters going, my pilot license, learning Japanese, learning Javascript/node.js
[3:04:22] armyparker91: basically im just trying to figure out how to be friend of the dopest cow in the world
[3:04:22] B1ackOblivion: @Cowsep Wise guy cow

[3:05:08] dandrg: how did you escape the debt tho?
[3:05:11] ZeptionT: damn
[3:05:15] xExuberantx: And your living conditions and childhood are what made you the way you are - ambitious, amongst other things
[3:05:19] Maymays_69: Unlucky mate.
[3:05:31] Knijz: at least you were a free american right? right? 4Head
[3:05:31] Dumbledood: some people strive to be better than their shitty childhood.
[3:06:04] CNcharacter: ill be ur friend 8========D

[3:07:11] nisoteric34: xdd
[3:07:12] hyperionentropic: The kenny 2.0?
[3:07:22] informationbot_: Cowsep when will you comeback here in PH server?
[3:07:28] brittleboneswr: bro was blaming everyone but himself
[3:07:30] lcry2Rtn: true
[3:07:43] blackeli9: @cowsep Did I ask something bad or?
[3:07:48] xExuberantx: LUL I sometimes wish I had more hardship as a kid, I wouldn't end up as soft as I am today
[3:07:51] dandrg: maan
[3:07:54] dandrg: that's sage
[3:08:06] brittleboneswr: yikes bro thats some insane lore
[3:08:07] dandrg: happy you paid it off
[3:08:16] hyperionentropic: Isn't there something to contest identity theft debt?
[3:08:17] nisoteric34: yikes
[3:08:17] Knijz: in a way you described me too, because at the moment i need to pay some debts then tryin to do my goals but i accept it

[3:09:25] Draygrah: Mom mdae about 18k a year
[3:09:31] dandrg: you re idea is that you want that people you have around should pass their condition
[3:09:38] lcry2Rtn: Yeah but then again, all these positive comments, and you focus on the one bad one. There's a lot of love and life around you, you just have to allow yourself to accept it.
[3:09:56] Spinelli_: some people aren’t able to see past their own nose, and understand that there are bigger things out there than their not-so-good upbringing..  ambition is key
[3:09:56] Knijz: yeah when i was young i used to get mad at these things but  really there is no reason to
