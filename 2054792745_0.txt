[3:55:36] ging3raffe: or is it unique bc it's a tiamat item
[3:55:59] zagreus7274: From what I saw online, stride Active now deals 80 percent total attack damage to enemies (still applies slow), passive now deals (40 percent melee/20 percent ranged) total attack damage to nearby enemies (still grants speed on dealing physical damage).
[3:56:28] 葉の小さい: it’s tiamat. should be unique now. like you can’t have two hydras
[3:57:01] ging3raffe: MANNNNNNN. I was having a lot of fun going stride > hydra and thought it was really good
