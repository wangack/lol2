[0:16:00] Halofan642: oh youre about to get udyr'd
[0:16:00] pdlemwkci: about to get out csd by plat PepeLaugh
[0:16:41] xallido: How’s he getting healed?
[0:16:43] sharffffff: and you were worried it was going to be boring
[0:17:03] pdlemwkci: LUL
[0:17:05] Halofan642: @xallido who?
[0:17:14] pdlemwkci: time to throw PogChamp
[0:17:41] Halofan642: why does he have lethal tempo ??
[0:18:22] SyntheeR: Nice car you got there
[0:18:23] RinaVX: but u got a sick car
[0:18:30] bentgrassxx: W makes you store damage as health when you damage champion you get health back
[0:18:45] edytluveo: 5upWave
[0:19:12] Halofan642: u wanna use mundo w whenever big damage comes out like veigar r for example
[0:19:15] Halofan642: and then itll become grey health
[0:19:59] bentgrassxx: Would the magic shield tank item good against udyr ?
[0:20:50] SyntheeR: Waiting for 5up to use the word "fiesta"
[0:21:31] charcoal10969: charcoal10969 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Half a year, let's gooo~ Woo 🎉🎉🎉
[0:22:41] griggy__: he doesn't die later on in game
[0:22:42] xallido: @halofan642, Udyr, he just seems to be getting back to full health immediately
[0:23:00] Halofan642: @xallido he gets lifesteal on his w
[0:23:08] Halofan642: his w also gives him a shield
[0:23:35] griggy__: new series road to plat
[0:23:35] xallido: Oh, I see; I’m completely new to the game
[0:24:02] Halofan642: no worries, thats why i mentioned that it gives him a shield to help you identify his w a little easier
[0:24:43] pdlemwkci: „I’m in smurf queue“ COPIUM
[0:24:54] helenabruhh: om
[0:25:00] Halofan642: udyr got his awaken off twice ye
[0:25:08] sharffffff: lmao
[0:25:10] TowHeadTed: empowered ls
[0:25:13] TaLmightyDom: Udyr is stupid riht now you need to ban him all the times
[0:25:17] XortedI: Udyr is such a bullshit champ
[0:25:26] Halofan642: the bar underneath his mana is his "ultimate" ability basically
[0:25:28] TowHeadTed: that was like his perfect fight
[0:25:33] pdlemwkci: COPIUM
[0:25:36] Halofan642: when its full/red he can empower one of his abilities
[0:25:49] TowHeadTed: he charges up empowered abilities and they're all broken af
[0:25:53] Halofan642: his empowered w gives him lots of shield, lots of lifesteal for two autos
[0:26:02] lunchcut: If you don't know what he does then why are you fighting him and over staying everytime he dies.  #throw
[0:26:09] helenabruhh: the little car is killing me everytime its so unserious
[0:26:15] TowHeadTed: its like not lifesteal tho its better than lifesteal
[0:26:19] TowHeadTed: its like life on hit
[0:26:20] balletbunny: PepegaDriving
[0:26:20] Halofan642: emp w = fat ass shield, huge lifesteal on nxet two autos
[0:26:27] Halofan642: emp q = lots of AS and lots of single target dmg
[0:26:32] Halofan642: @TowHeadTed its both
[0:27:05] Halofan642: and emp w gives him health regardless of on hit as well, but its just easier to say lifesteal
[0:27:20] RinaVX: based mundo
[0:27:45] griggy__: mundo scales a lot, he's pretty hard to kill later on
[0:28:16] Halofan642: udyr will probably stoill kill him tbh
[0:28:22] Halofan642: he has %maxhp
[0:28:47] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[0:29:45] bentgrassxx: Yes
[0:29:50] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[0:29:56] Halofan642: right now he does like 24% max hp with regular q, empowered q does like 40% if isolated
[0:30:01] Halofan642: yeah this matchup is p bad id think
[0:30:10] Puttputtlol: huh
[0:30:16] xallido: Damn
[0:30:18] RinaVX: i like the part where u fell over
[0:30:37] Puttputtlol: owuld live without that creep auto 100%
[0:30:49] griggy__: 5up act like you're enjoying Mundo so no one says it again LUL
[0:31:11] Halofan642: do u have to win on mundo before u go to next champ
[0:31:29] griggy__: @halofan642 nope
[0:31:39] Halofan642: thx
[0:31:40] SorayaSayo: nope only one game
[0:31:54] mitchie_2484: hello 5upWave
[0:32:23] SyntheeR: Why are you continue to try against him while you see you cannot
[0:32:27] lunchcut: lol GL on your fed lane
[0:32:31] lunchcut: have a nice day
[0:32:46] Puttputtlol: tell yourself people que champs they don't know how to play xd
[0:32:55] bentgrassxx: Did you pick first
[0:33:00] griggy__: empowered is fucked up
[0:33:42] Halofan642: as an udyr enthusiast its pretty funny tbh
[0:33:45] Puttputtlol: well, don't all in him
[0:33:57] Halofan642: ur pov gives me an idea of what people go thru when i play udyr
[0:34:12] RinaVX: leaving the game
[0:34:15] RinaVX: ideally
[0:34:18] Halofan642: well at this point, nothing
[0:34:20] Puttputtlol: pick another champ KEKW
[0:34:24] Halofan642: youre way to far behind
[0:34:25] RinaVX: and queuing a better game
[0:34:31] Halofan642: other than that try and fight with your minion wave cause it lowers his dps a decent amount
[0:34:32] Puttputtlol: maybe go another lane tbh
[0:34:33] griggy__: poke with Q and pray LUL
[0:35:06] Puttputtlol: build for their team instead
[0:35:18] Skrunken: antiheal?
[0:35:41] Halofan642: uh i think his q counts as a crit so maybe randuins
[0:36:39] RinaVX: go full ad
[0:37:09] ar_pachauri: How many games have been played ? Or is this the first one ?
[0:39:29] xallido: @ar_pachauri, this is the first one
[0:39:42] RinaVX: why not titanic hydra
[0:39:46] RinaVX: and trinity force
[0:40:09] Halofan642: he will die to udyr
[0:40:15] griggy__: is Mundo jgl?
[0:40:17] Halofan642: with no armor i think
[0:40:28] RinaVX: go steraks ull be ight
[0:40:47] xallido: @halofan642, what lane do you play Udyr on?
[0:41:10] Halofan642: @xallido mostly jg, but recently ive started playing him top as well
[0:41:51] looooor: how good is this mundo skin, you even got a car
[0:42:53] XortedI: 2/7 in plat elo damn
[0:42:59] Halofan642: the udyr fucked that up mechanically i think too
[0:43:06] kurseppp: 5upD
[0:43:23] Puttputtlol: i think he one shots u under turret
[0:43:31] griggy__: road to plat 🔥
[0:43:48] Puttputtlol: -1
[0:43:51] vsmilotic: uncanny dragon is back
[0:43:57] vsmilotic: wait this arent dragon
[0:44:10] RinaVX: mickey mouse hero
[0:44:33] Halofan642: hes so fun
[0:44:49] bentgrassxx: Your HUD is huge lol
[0:44:51] Halofan642: u run around ppl die u stat check most champs infinite sustain %maxhp
[0:44:58] vsmilotic: mundo SMOrc ?
[0:45:08] XortedI: Wiat what was that kog skin lmaooo
[0:45:41] wolven9: i think its the butterfly kog skin iirc
[0:46:06] XortedI: Beautiful
[0:46:10] vsmilotic: dont think so i think udyr kill inting sion too slow
[0:46:34] Rose_blinkssss: the skin is cute
[0:46:48] griggy__: Jebaited
[0:46:49] Halofan642: he shits on sion early but sion can get to a point where he just kinda doesnt die
[0:46:56] Halofan642: and then it becomes a stalemate in the side
[0:47:13] Halofan642: at least in the few games ive played against it
[0:47:35] vsmilotic: sion have more hp and shield than mundo and he can ulti away
[0:47:38] Halofan642: sunfire
[0:47:51] Halofan642: ye and his w helps a lot against udyr
[0:47:57] vsmilotic: and yes sunfire
[0:48:10] kurseppp: at least you guys have soul 5upPrime
[0:48:15] Halofan642: sunfire just obliterates the wave, and makes it so he can fight with udyr for short amt of time, cause he gains so much hp from w
[0:48:20] Skrunken: clearly not enough armor vicksyShrug
[0:48:28] bentgrassxx: Isn't the max health damage from his R is magic damage ?
[0:48:29] SyntheeR: sunfire sounds good
[0:49:04] vsmilotic: he deal mix damage
[0:49:05] Halofan642: yeah lillia just runs circles around u
[0:49:23] vsmilotic: and this udry build is more of split push 1v1 it cant kill sion
[0:49:30] vsmilotic: how do u get baron again? LUL
[0:51:26] TheHayeShawn: So glad I ain't choosing for 5up cause Id choose completely terrible LUL
[0:52:56] SyntheeR: Holy slow
[0:53:21] ar_pachauri: How does the chat choosing champions work ? Like, what is the process ?

[3:06:21] EmmatheRedPanda: krug questions us
[3:06:34] champrath: Maybe go tear into Liandries for   sustained damage? if they are tanky or just normal build if they are not
[3:06:37] 9fierce9: Hi 5up, youre now my study background noise, congrstulations
[3:06:40] SyntheeR: Elise top + autofilled jungler does not sound good, but people didn't dodge cat games, so you never know
[3:06:43] 1hasnoodles: do you have all champs unlocked?
[3:07:08] bentgrassxx: she is a bit mana hungry tho

[3:12:17] 9fierce9: What elo are you in now?
[3:12:23] 9fierce9: On the alt that is
[3:12:31] vDaishar: Yeah if he's gonna make it obvious
[3:12:33] angelarson: @9fierce9 plat 2
[3:12:34] champrath: This person wasnt expecting the Elise top technology
[3:12:42] OldestDreamer: lol
[3:12:53] Mr12th: LUL good setup
[3:12:54] SyntheeR: Even the SirShield will not help that Pantheon

[3:14:18] Mr12th: that pant is gonna need some ganks
[3:14:32] vsmilotic: is elise top broken? Kappa
[3:14:39] vDaishar: Her humanoid form is ranged and her spider form is melee
[3:15:08] Beemittens: skinny legend
[3:16:03] SorayaSayo: you mentioned the skinny legs before yep 5upJorts
[3:16:05] champrath: her waveclear is kinda bad is the issue i think
[3:16:10] TwinDissonance: people played her top so much on release she got immediately nerfed
[3:16:14] pureiinsanity: that pant is a pushover
[3:16:16] pureiinsanity: can't tell
[3:16:20] Mr12th: he is so pissed right now
[3:16:21] Beemittens: you’re shitting on him
[3:16:23] vsmilotic: how broken is elise top Kappa
[3:16:28] 9fierce9: I mean youre in plat 2
[3:16:28] Drude27: Yeah i remember hating her top when she was popular
[3:16:33] lavfully: damn
[3:16:36] lavfully: styled on
[3:16:36] Drude27: facing*
[3:16:57] champrath: Tbh there were spots Panth would win if he just engaged but he is too scared
[3:17:00] AidMich: how's the jg doing
[3:17:29] champrath: There was one near like 2 minions left on your side you were human there
[3:17:40] champrath: he jumps 2 minions die if you decide to fight there is a wave fighting you there
[3:18:10] vDaishar: No he likes fighting in 5ups wave more
[3:18:19] AkitaAttribute: Plus you're also ranged+melee depending on form.  So poke is insane
[3:18:24] SyntheeR: 3 level difference, poor P
[3:18:30] zaiMEEE: lvl 9 vs lvl 6 KEKW
[3:19:11] EmmatheRedPanda: can someone explain to me please why we don't just focus on the tower as soon as we kill pantheon
[3:19:14] AkitaAttribute: Plus your escape is pretty safe
[3:19:34] FrozenLavaReflector: And panth ignite
[3:20:02] EmmatheRedPanda: Ohhhhh okay
[3:20:04] EmmatheRedPanda: Thank you
[3:20:09] AkitaAttribute: Also pre 5 minutes it has extra strength
[3:20:13] champrath: Plates are actually godsend bot tower use to fall so fast
[3:20:14] EmmatheRedPanda: Yep. Gotcha :))
[3:20:23] FrozenLavaReflector: And for like 20-30 seconds after taking a plating, tower becomes even more tanky
[3:20:45] solpiperita: oh,,, the champion doesnt stay spoder :((((
[3:20:51] solpiperita: <- devastated
[3:20:52] AkitaAttribute: They really wanted to nerf inting sion lol

[3:21:49] wetsfeeb: are we elise mains now?
[3:21:52] champrath: W max + Nashor goes crazy
[3:21:56] solpiperita: peepoCheer
[3:22:13] EmmatheRedPanda: What does AP mean?
[3:22:22] zaiMEEE: pantheon saving his ulti for 2025 when he gets another tower
[3:22:26] Mr12th: @EmmatheRedPanda ability power
[3:22:30] AkitaAttribute: Your champ is natural jungler, might as well steal camps
[3:22:31] Drude27: If he is facing a Panth top it may become a pocket pick
[3:22:42] FrozenLavaReflector: Ap means magic essentially
[3:22:55] EmmatheRedPanda: @Mr12th Thank you! Remind me what the alternative was?
[3:22:56] chariiteee: @EmmatheRedPanda ap means magic damage, which is blue in ability descriptions. ad is physical, and is orange in the descriptions
[3:23:03] EmmatheRedPanda: @FrozenLavaReflector Thank you!
[3:23:16] EmmatheRedPanda: @chariiteee Ahhhhh thank you so much !

[3:38:28] AkitaAttribute: The tenacity is wild
[3:38:30] champrath: crypt bloom is the better item
[3:38:44] VengfulDark: It's very overturned, but it gives weird stats most champs can't entirely use.
[3:38:46] FrozenLavaReflector: Wits end is an overtuned item, but because no AD on it, nobody wants to buy it
[3:38:46] champrath: literally pen item with haste thats all you need
[3:38:51] AkitaAttribute: Witts + Steracks + Merc Treads = any champ is garen
[3:39:04] wetsfeeb: stole penta Madge
[3:39:07] Jules_vdc: gj vayne
[3:39:11] FrozenLavaReflector: I swear ADC's are allergic to buying defensive items
[3:39:30] VengfulDark: Elise actually scales now, which is a weird feeling
[3:39:31] iauja: best defense is to kill the enemy first\
[3:39:34] SylHoliday: Oh no he's liking it swifYikes
[3:39:36] Drude27: it used to be even stronger
[3:39:54] jonathon_irl: @FrozenLavaReflector a few years of having galeforce and stopwatch conditioned them not to
[3:40:06] VengfulDark: Elise used to fall off a cliff before the item changes.
