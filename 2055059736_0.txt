[0:05:57] Faramir1993: omg how is this still in game
[0:05:58] xcalebur: surely not the milio who linked the multigg
[0:05:59] DonnTeoo: How does smolder feel now that you have played him a lot more
[0:06:04] spectre759: the store always works
[0:06:07] dea1hwish: ICANT need to wait a few days before they're adding Vanguard

[0:06:25] jutziie: how to play laning
[0:06:49] DonnTeoo: I played several games against him and I've noticed that he can outscale most champs. For example I played Samira, and he outscaled me mid-late game with no problem
[0:06:50] Faramir1993: idk is RIOT still alive
[0:06:56] Faramir1993: how*
[0:07:14] miazma1: ok we go aery

[0:07:51] jutziie: what site is that
[0:08:00] 365Doors: lolalytics
[0:08:21] g4nl0cK: riot only recommends LT and PTA @Jackspektra
[0:08:27] 365Doors: might take some time to get used to reading the site, there is SO much info that you dont always need
[0:08:37] qingydz: chat did he already talk about the lane bully runes with comet?
[0:08:58] xcalebur: isnt kaisa dog rn?
[0:09:09] Faramir1993: RIOT sad company unfortunately
[0:09:16] 365Doors: Nerdge actually riot made the champ so they must know best about how it is optimally played
[0:09:25] Faramir1993: but ezreal is boring(
[0:09:26] Auris_: maybe LT is ok wiv extra q range but i doubt it outperforms fleet
[0:09:56] 2Sirious4u: what about comet smolder?
[0:10:02] soki34: ezreal is one of the funnier adcs imo
[0:10:06] banewastaken: Ezreal is pretty fun out of lane for me
[0:10:06] Auris_: true true
[0:10:10] banewastaken: I dislike laning as Ez
[0:10:12] 365Doors: how much worse is conq then?
[0:10:18] Faramir1993: boring to watch maybe fun to play

[2:24:15] justcanlol: bc after 30min its literally unplayable against that if he have some front
[2:24:23] Choc_xD: Dont they buff essence next patch? thats also like a small buff to him
[2:24:35] clueless810: Smolder needs some tweaking to his survivability imo
[2:24:37] Choc_xD: and make sheen 100g cheaper
[2:24:40] sonnyfawkeye: is your guide still valid or did you change opinions on something

[2:26:34] DKS_Zen: I feel like navori does the same damage as shojin (second item speaking) and the cd refund on q is meaningless (you sneak like 1 auto per q)
[2:26:34] Lord0aks: Donde está?

[2:32:08] rakkuza: yo where are they
[2:32:11] Hook123: So you don't really get anything from stacking more right?
[2:32:18] seekr21: @Hook123 abilities get stronger
[2:32:19] StayPuft609: this guy needs to be able to q towers for some reduced dmg or something
[2:32:21] abergafishy: Is that build even viable ? or he's just trying things out?
[2:32:21] vito_baloney_spaghetti: @ossmaaa12 smolders burn keeps you  "in combat" so eats easy to get the dmg bonus
[2:32:27] StayPuft609: he does legit 0 tower dmg
[2:32:30] seekr21: i dont see how you dont run out of mana
[2:32:33] vito_baloney_spaghetti: @ossmaaa12 it's*

[2:45:16] allltrickpony: it does
[2:45:17] Hunters_Envy: it works on burn
[2:45:29] DKS_Zen: Pretty sure it does not
[2:45:32] onsra_xo: it doesn't, the passive procs on magic dmg
[2:45:33] Eilaver: maligma
[2:45:35] onsra_xo: passive is true dmg
[2:45:35] RaunchySquirrel: btw, youre doing physical damage even with ap @Jackspektra
[2:45:37] onsra_xo: no?
[2:45:44] allltrickpony: ive tested it on lilia and udyr it definitely works on burn
[2:45:53] onsra_xo: @allltrickpony yes cus it's magic dmg
[2:45:59] onsra_xo: smolder passive is true dmg
[2:46:02] Gabiel19: it says ability damage
[2:46:11] StreamElements: The newest video on Youtube is https://youtu.be/2jqAw6EL7Fk . Don't miss it!
[2:46:13] avxm1v9: raba bad last?
[2:46:19] allltrickpony: it says ability damage not magic
[2:46:23] onsra_xo: @Gabiel19 ah mb
[2:46:28] donk3y_teeth: the actual skills deal physical damage, but your passive gives each of your abilities magic damage
[2:46:29] Asepor: jack banning draven... what a time to be alive :(
[2:46:38] bendikss1: what runes? @Jackspektra
[2:46:41] AlucardCG: @Jackspektra wait the build is shojin , iceborn into ap?
[2:46:42] allltrickpony: have you tried building shojin and navori together
[2:46:46] avxm1v9: rabadons last just insane dmg tho no?
[2:46:56] yeray309: you became what you swore to destroy
[2:47:08] Kinteshi: @Jackspektra what do you think about kaisa in 2024?+
[2:47:13] Se_Bre: With w three points is mega safe even against draven
[2:47:26] duck_on_horse: I think you need early tear in that build for mana regen
[2:47:26] donk3y_teeth: isn't shojin+navori diminishing returns?
[2:47:28] uShouldLogOut: wha tis the build to go for smolder?
[2:47:29] Fidus44: i dont think i the draven knows what he is doing smolder is not really playable, you are so weak early, defenetly need someone to peel as support
[2:47:35] allltrickpony: smolder matchups feel more reliant on support rather than him
[2:47:35] duck_on_horse: Last item upgrade manumune
