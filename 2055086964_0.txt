[0:20:20] f0laaaaa: I can't imagine it
[0:20:41] zvr1: i only grow out my beard.. i hate it when my stache is long
[0:20:42] magmagsoh: usually Asians have sparse facial hair though
[0:20:48] zvr1: yeah same
[0:20:50] 1nfk: if my brothers did theyd get smacked by grandma
[0:20:51] S3rp3nt_007: mine doesnt connect either Smoge
[0:21:02] beirdsman: dood I hate shaving cause if you let it grow stubs it gets soooo itchy, rather have a full face of hair(I'm guessing my ancestors banged a mongul)
[0:21:21] TheBenShee: @zvr1 same.... i always cut my mustache slightly over my lip. the rest is just long
[0:21:41] magmagsoh: when is streamer awards again
[0:21:48] zvr1: @TheBenShee i straight up shave it.. i hate when it gets when when i drink water or whatever
[0:21:59] BloodlineHeresy: massage the patchy parts abe and soon it wont be patchy
[0:21:59] beirdsman: nooooooo, it doesn't feel gross!!! dude you need a "bore bristle brush" or hoarse hair, it exfoliates and distributes the oils for your facial hair
[0:22:02] City45: ya it makes me feel itchy and mine doesnâ€™t grow evenly. but I also am too lazy to shave it until its relatively noticeable ðŸ˜‚
[0:22:04] zvr1: someone send her a chipotle bowl
[0:22:07] TheBenShee: @Abe you really need to get into beard care products. atleast every 3 days for a nice beard wash and minimum some oil every second day to not let it dry out
[0:22:07] jepgoingdark: it doesnt take that long for my beard to grow again even after cleanly shaved
[0:22:31] beirdsman: @zvr1 nah, after a while you get used to it, always trim your stache and the beard you can tie up, or keep it a bit shorter
[0:22:51] neelerita: peepoFinger welcome back old man, you promised us saki pics
[0:22:51] beirdsman: @TheBenShee see this man knows
[0:23:01] zvr1: nah i hate it lmao.. i tried getting used to it, i hate it..
[0:23:35] TheBenShee: @zvr1 that's why i do it slightly over the lip. my hair never touches water or others and i drink out of a nice keg
[0:23:49] beirdsman: ewwww ... LOL it sounds gross when you describe it
[0:23:55] TheBenShee: @beirdsman dude... my experience changed when i started to actuallydo things to it lol
