[0:48:22] Sammyraii: "Caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases at the same time cerebral blood flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion. Caffeine activates noradrenaline neurons and seems to affect the local release of dopamine"
[0:48:36] Cris: hit you with the facts son
[0:48:39] theGESofIT: is this Joe Rogan podcast?
[0:48:41] Cris: it’s joever

[1:18:22] RevJim_Jones: alert?
[1:18:25] wilsonao: The only augment that matters is consistency
[1:18:33] HeerlolRy: coherent
[1:18:43] angahax: are there lasting effects of caffeine?
[1:19:09] DaMotorBoater: it alters the circadian rhythm but thats bout it
[1:19:37] Sammyraii: I think I get what you mean
[1:20:07] Sammyraii: but coffee still helps me to get work done in the morning
[1:20:22] Sammyraii: in moderation
[1:20:22] TheZim: i just read an article of a food scientist from the university of newcastle and it states that caffeine wont block forever
[1:20:42] wilsonao: And then you do ketamine, and then you buy twitter, and then you start posting crazy stuff
[1:20:57] MrFriendo: steals future energy
[1:21:19] wilsonao: I do one cup a day cause i like the taste EZ
[1:22:08] darkuTheKING: thats why i changed coffe to coke
[1:22:15] J1mmY99: is caffeine a code word for something... lol
[1:22:20] TheZim: yes you did
[1:22:22] 187juggernaut: @MrFriendo 💯
[1:22:22] wilsonao: > Caffeine tolerance is built up over time and can happen as fast as one week. Caffeine creates stimulation by blocking adenosine receptors in our brains. When we regularly consume caffeine, our brain adapts, and develops more adenosine receptors.
[1:22:43] komrade1elessar: all I'm hearing is that I'm venerated for never really getting into coffee in the first place :^)
[1:22:44] TheZim: you said, if you drank caffeine once in your life
[1:22:51] wilsonao: "It has permanent effects on you and makes yourt peepee small" - saintvicious 2019
[1:23:09] Sammyraii: @TheZim true though KEKW
[1:23:32] wilsonao: "no fatties" -saintvicious, just now
[1:23:54] Sammyraii: caffeine tolerance is the key point
[1:24:08] Sammyraii: didn't know it would happen so fast
[1:26:06] Cris: alright I’m back chat did he explain how caffeine is fake and doesn’t do anything?
[1:26:50] ArthGrimalkin: Yes, we are still in shambles. Topic is finished. Now we are just waiting for the lvl 2 Lucian spike

[3:01:22] fatguy925: Stocks raise with inflation
[3:01:29] shu99ster: lol is he gunna bring the graph out again
[3:01:33] shu99ster: yep
[3:01:58] gangblu3: Short term stocks can still cripple you
[3:02:07] fatguy925: IF you are truly risk adverse, buy bonds that hold value and match inflation.
[3:02:08] shu99ster: Yea thats y u dont do short term
[3:02:24] gangblu3: If it crash
[3:02:30] sleep_tight_pup: >financial advice from twitch chat monkaS
[3:02:30] shu99ster: and limit ur active investing
[3:02:37] Rgcommander: this is why we need financial literacy in highschool NotLikeThis
[3:02:43] fatguy925: IF it crashes, thats the best time to invest in stocks
[3:02:43] zizuc: When productivity declines faster than the supply of money, the value of each unit of currency drops. The most common monetary phenomenon, inflation, is produced the other way around; the supply of money grows faster than productivity.
[3:02:44] CynderHS: don't lose money unless you sell
[3:03:01] TheLoho: That's not covid that's the recession lol
[3:03:03] fatguy925: Economies recover KEKW

[3:03:49] gangblu3: That's the most recent crash is not a good example
[3:03:50] shu99ster: agree whole heartedly
[3:04:01] shu99ster: it annoys me when people equate this to gambaling
[3:04:22] LlgerZer0: stonks always go up
[3:04:26] Rgcommander: @gangblu3 dude. we have historical evidence the stock market always increases over the long run.
[3:04:39] LlgerZer0: the fucking chart shows it
[3:04:42] LlgerZer0: right there

[3:05:45] Mbubs: What about from some Twitch Streamer?

[3:07:20] redrobe: Depends on your country if you are lin Luxembourg in europe you buy houe trst me just buy a house LUL LUL
[3:07:22] fatguy925: Buying house doesn't actually increase in value, economists call it a wealth deception gain.
[3:07:22] Perfectwall: My kitchen flooded over the christmas break and I've been dealing with insurance for months, houses are alot more work than a portfolio LUL
[3:07:24] panchos8812: best thing to invest money into after stocks is buying land
[3:07:32] zizuc: You can also use a house as an asset and barrow against it`s value to further grow your portfolio
[3:07:54] galactic_pie: dont take advice from some one that cant spell borrow
[3:08:08] fatguy925: barrow AYAYA

[3:10:54] Rhuid: as much as you can afford and still live comfortably
[3:11:02] sammy_mg: does brokerage matter
[3:11:08] fatguy925: Of your disposable income, 5% to 20% is the reccommend by most experts
[3:11:18] fatguy925: This does not include yout 10% pleasure fund
[3:11:50] Rhuid: too busy telling chat to invest lol
