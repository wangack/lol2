[2:45:31] Carlos12288: Zac's sustain is ridiculous
[2:45:49] Carlos12288: with Spirit Visage you basically heal more than if you had warmogs
[2:45:53] Carlos12288: it's nuts

[2:49:54] Carlos12288: yeah, they're also hard to see unless you're specifically looking for them
[2:50:17] Forex928: anti heal pretty much useless in general so it's a waste
[2:50:17] Tubeezz: I hope they will make a white skin for Zac someday
[2:50:29] Carlos12288: Also you just get spirit visage and the GW is just bringing you down to 80% of what you'd heal normally
[2:50:29] Cyrillizius: even with bramble if u dont hit him u dont get grievus

[2:55:32] sirbrarne: YEP TRUCK
[2:55:38] Carlos12288: he also deals absolutely ridiculous damage for a tank
[2:55:44] being_nice_is_op: What other champs scales a lot with hp?
[2:55:52] slamhk: sion
[2:55:56] qduke: this champ looks balanced its time to nerf ryze and zeri
[2:56:00] Carlos12288: 7% maxhp magic damage on each W hit

[2:57:02] Carlos12288: he's not vulnerable
[2:57:06] being_nice_is_op: But mundo gets bonus ad based on bonus health
[2:57:22] qduke: 0 deaths game
