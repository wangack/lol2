[0:12:54] viegooo47: @bobqinxd Smolder is worse than Briar. At least, when Brier came out, it was difficult

[0:14:04] tytronic07: Sup Bobby! Hope you have some awesome games today! Let's get it!
[0:14:19] viegooo47: @bobqinxd Smolder is worse than Briar. At least, when Brier came out, it was difficult
[0:14:25] ctrlaltleblanc: i swear smolder can be op but a lot of players dont move to fights and get jebaited into only stacking from cs
[0:14:41] ctrlaltleblanc: its like veigar players that never move from lane
[0:15:06] Meepssheep: Smolder is a lot better if you go comet + dring like the opponent is doing
[0:15:20] Pessimistic_Tryhard: Idk smolder seems crazy safe to me. Farms easily strong escapes.

[1:09:43] Zerophyne: whats good about horizon focus?
[1:09:46] ctrlaltleblanc: especially making a misplay lategame in a 1v9 game
[1:10:24] ctrlaltleblanc: @Zerophyne its cheap, gives good stats like cdr, its components are easy to build and useful
[1:10:42] ctrlaltleblanc: and since the buff to HF, lb can proc it on her spells

[1:18:59] ctrlaltleblanc: few things are overtuned as always. but i much prefer current meta to boring mythics. and a lot of assassins are being played so lanes are often fun
[1:19:16] ctrlaltleblanc: theres usually a lot of action in games
[1:19:17] themaritimeguy: type in all chat the sun is in your eyes
[1:19:55] Zerophyne: AINTNOWAY

[1:26:27] ctrlaltleblanc: dont look now but kata got 450
[1:28:03] Dragonung: how is mimic Q for farming if it refunds
[1:28:25] ctrlaltleblanc: mimic q?
[1:28:35] ctrlaltleblanc: you mean R(q)?
[1:28:50] Dragonung: yes
[1:29:35] ctrlaltleblanc: i dont see many lbs do it. but you can use R(q) to farm cannon waves. especially if running ult hunter or post lv 11
[1:29:47] princeypal: 225
[1:30:24] ctrlaltleblanc: but if you think you might need r. see here, had bob used r, kata will have threat on him
[1:30:40] mrxsnowsoul: 225 his q becomes q execute
[1:30:46] ctrlaltleblanc: so you gotta make sure no enemies are nearby. its often better to avoid using r wherever possible to farm waves

[1:42:46] Zerophyne: isnt taste of blood better value then sudden impact? ifeel like it always restores way more than sudden does dmg
[1:42:59] ChampionshipLeBlanc: u absolutely cannot kill sej alone

[1:44:16] ctrlaltleblanc: @gl_mev1 its a cheap efficient item that, since they lowered activation range from 700-600, procs off lb abilities also. its ez to build also the components
[1:44:27] ctrlaltleblanc: and stats are good and what lb wants

[4:39:01] Stephen1618: Now you always get bronze
[4:39:09] phorizzles: how's horizon focus on lb?
[4:39:38] S1Vayne: biggest issue is in low elo for some reason there is so many autofills, even though they are majority of playerbase
[4:39:51] S1Vayne: idk why they dont make queue times 3 minute instead of 30 seconds
[4:40:10] windfuryjiji: The game is way more team based then previous seasons sicne like s11 imo thats why it feels harder to win as 1 good player vs the rest of game
[4:40:21] deVall3y: has bobqin talked about the new statikk nerfs? is it still viable?
[4:40:35] mrbubbybear: Yeah, I don't think expecting go to 10-0 is what made it happen. So many other factors. The one thing that can carry over to every game is just playing your best with whatever situation you've got at hand, right?
[4:40:44] ParadoxycalGaming: Careful, Midbeast is probably watching.
