[0:12:34] Bailey_The_Cat: TF should still be fun
[0:12:42] stivan7021: @lethalbonsai Riot should really stop being indie company and fix ranked  gains
[0:13:00] reaper_of_aspects: ad crit TF!

[0:14:01] queke___: chat this jhin doesn't have guns, why?
[0:14:06] TheFlamingTiger357: @Texxin Thank you king!
[0:14:26] XChaoLanX: @queke___ he traded them in because he needed money
[0:14:43] Texxin: yessir
[0:14:47] chipichipichapachapagr: I thought his range was nerfed when he came out did they buff it back?
[0:15:04] queke___: @XChaoLanX why was he broke
[0:15:29] XChaoLanX: inflation Despairge
[0:15:37] queke___: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:15:47] MihaiOSS: not inflation Despairge
[0:16:03] SyrobeNA: aether131YAYAYA
[0:16:33] lethalbonsai: which w card deal most dmg to tower ?
[0:16:45] adcalwaysgonnadie: wideBUSSERS yo
[0:17:18] XChaoLanX: blue card does the most damage
[0:17:23] Moofie: hi! i see that ur first timing jhin, if you need any tips dont hesitate to ask me!
[0:17:27] KAP_out: hi taco and chat peepoHey
[0:17:38] lethalbonsai: @xchaolanx ty
[0:17:39] theb00geyman: mid banned my junglers yi and sent yi off and i couldnt dodge again. ive been griefed so fucking hard today.
[0:17:44] MihaiOSS: udyr xdding
[0:18:01] SeitanLoL: @theb00geyman first mistake is playing in middle of day, gotta hit them 3am ranked queues
[0:18:31] theb00geyman: @theb00geyman true fuck me for wanting to play on my day off lol
[0:18:48] Moofie: :b
[0:19:21] demonminer3: taco, you can't just first time jhin in ranked! thats incredibly rude to other players who are actually trying to climb, and could disrupt general game quality D:
[0:19:37] AliensSmokeToo: nice try xdd
[0:19:41] lethalbonsai: taco or chat any tip how to escape emerald elo ?
[0:19:48] SeitanLoL: ranked is the original practice tool
[0:19:48] Nightbot: Ranked is back up so I can sell my soul back to Riot in exchange for some fake internet points :)
[0:20:09] SeitanLoL: @lethalbonsai what lane do u play
[0:20:15] St3lkinator: @lethalbonsai get good! works like a charm! ! !
[0:20:39] FrogityBomb: Did he get autofilled?
[0:20:45] lethalbonsai: @seitanlol main adc but i can play supp jg top and mid (only with adcs)
[0:20:54] lethalbonsai: but where i really shine is adc
[0:21:02] lethalbonsai: the. jg and top
[0:21:06] lethalbonsai: then*
[0:21:07] Moofie: frik azir Madge
[0:21:11] DShakeyX: Yeah that was crazy close
[0:21:27] Bailey_The_Cat: if ashe got stunned a split second faster too, before she got in the bush
[0:21:33] AliensSmokeToo: @lethalbonsai u cant escape rank with adc
[0:21:43] demonminer3: @lethalbonsai analyse how you lost in replays, what caused you to not be able to gain a lead, or how you lost a lead? did you go for a play that went wrong? how did it go wrong? was there any way you could have stopped an enemies snowball without compromising your lane? what about what you didnt go for? were there opportunities to get ahead that you simply didnt take?
[0:21:51] SeitanLoL: Go online and try to find a support who mains your fav support. Try to just play one role. My ACTUAL advice though is to play Graves and Kindred jungle and leave adc
[0:21:54] lethalbonsai: @seitanlol like with adc im always ahove emerald stats and most of the time d1
[0:21:58] MihaiOSS: what is udyr doing this game man Despairge
[0:21:58] demonminer3: @demonminer3 word wall i know, but this is how you get better
[0:22:20] Wuju_samurai: it's great advice, Demon
[0:22:24] KrustyKrabP1zzaa: turn music up a teeny bit?
[0:22:48] SeitanLoL: Demon has the practical advice, I have the "I also tried climbing as adc and it sucked" advice
[0:22:51] lethalbonsai: @demonminer3 i rarely lose to misplays i lose ccuz i fill with tilted mfs since i got 1 chat restriction xD
[0:22:56] Divi1404: why isn’t taco taking q?
[0:23:00] demonminer3: @Wuju_samurai it's just general advice tbh. and i dont really do it myself, though i should if i want to improve
[0:23:25] MihaiOSS: xdd
[0:23:34] lethalbonsai: @seitanlol xe
[0:23:36] lethalbonsai: xD
[0:23:37] Nightbot: XD
[0:23:48] AliensSmokeToo: @demonminer3 u dont need to analyse emerald games. If u cant escape it thats all your fault.
[0:24:07] Moofie: ur evil
[0:24:14] demonminer3: @lethalbonsai even if that is true, you CANNOT control your teammates actions. it's pointless, really. the only way you can climb, is to improve.
[0:24:19] Moofie: Evilowo
[0:24:29] TheButterDoctor: minidenWat
[0:24:49] Lichyness: caught yapping
[0:24:53] FrogityBomb: @lethalbonsai Farming and just getting a massive lead as a adc can do alot for you
[0:25:12] wwaterbearer: music def loud enough
[0:25:14] lethalbonsai: @seitanlol what if i go mid with adcs ?
[0:25:15] StraightErro: sounds fine
[0:25:19] wwaterbearer: its almost over top of your talking
[0:25:30] AliensSmokeToo: @lethalbonsai just dont...
[0:25:33] demonminer3: @FrogityBomb oh yes, it also depends on what role you play. but i bbelieve that everything i said can apply to every role
[0:25:54] lethalbonsai: @frogitybomb like even if i lose i have constat minimun 7 cs/ min
[0:26:10] lethalbonsai: worst i go
[0:26:27] FrogityBomb: @lethalbonsai Who do you play most of the time?
[0:26:29] AliensSmokeToo: @demonminer3 its might be apply to ewvery role except adc ( cuz u stat check sup>jg>mid)
[0:26:39] lethalbonsai: @frogitybomb as adc ?
[0:26:53] FrogityBomb: Yea
[0:27:04] lethalbonsai: i play jhin cait jinx trist sivir
[0:27:24] lethalbonsai: now im trying smolder a lot and i see that i can do well with him too
[0:27:28] demonminer3: @AliensSmokeToo some adcs can go mid; tristana, lucian (he gets gutted whenever he's viable solo lane) vayne top is notorious, smolder is playable in mid, kog has been known to go mid, etc
[0:27:33] lethalbonsai: just cant do shit with tilted guys i fill
[0:27:49] FrogityBomb: I sadly had to put down playing jinx for now, at least for me right now early game adcs seem to be the most viable to win games
[0:28:11] AliensSmokeToo: @demonminer3 and most of times you will burden to your team cuz someone get akali and oneshot adc/sup
[0:28:12] Ellisand3: why attack speed is too high
[0:28:16] lbku: thoughts on the stormrazor changes? no more AD ratio :(
[0:28:19] Ellisand3: is so high*
[0:29:03] nattasama: do you build life steal?
[0:29:24] MihaiOSS: huh
[0:29:29] Shagidzun: is essence reaver/trinity good on tf?
[0:29:33] Lenox14: @Ellisand3 E gives up to 60& bonus AS
[0:29:41] Lenox14: *%
[0:30:02] demonminer3: @AliensSmokeToo true. but that's why you pick marksmen with self peel/ high range. kog maw likes to go AP in solo lanes iirc, cuz he can outrange most matchups with his spells. vayne can tumble out of skillshots and kite enemies. lucian has a dash, caitlyn has a dash, CC, and range. its all about knowing your champ
[0:30:26] mariomds1: Winnable :D
[0:30:46] thicc_fil_ayyy: Flash Blue card
[0:31:00] demonminer3: blue card does most damage right?
[0:31:02] MihaiOSS: EZ
[0:31:02] televangelon: huge
[0:31:03] Bailey_The_Cat: wait its winnable
[0:31:08] Julienpleb: @demonminer3 YEO
[0:31:12] Julienpleb: YEP
[0:31:14] Lenox14: hot damn PogChimp
[0:31:15] zipztah: Comeback kings!!
[0:31:17] FrogityBomb: We love when a team throws their lead
[0:31:30] demonminer3: @Julienpleb followed by red, which is aoe with a slow, and then gold which has the stun.
[0:31:37] the_warp_enjhin: Getting a sheen item?
[0:31:42] KayXOTV: why does people not just buy frozen heart against your tf
[0:31:49] Julienpleb: @demonminer3 Yea exactly
[0:32:18] thomsh77: Hello Taco, hello everyone
[0:32:27] demonminer3: does runaans apply gold card?
[0:32:33] zipztah: Do you wanna go pro? if not,why?
[0:32:34] Lenox14: @demonminer3 no
[0:32:36] FrogityBomb: No
[0:32:38] MihaiOSS: udyr making sure u lose this one Despairge
[0:32:47] the_warp_enjhin: I KEEP IT PIRATE?????
[0:32:51] AliensSmokeToo: @demonminer3 i can get tristana/tf mid as adc but why ? You pick any mage/ass and go in
[0:32:52] KayXOTV: he pressed R
[0:32:55] KayXOTV: POG
[0:33:40] demonminer3: @AliensSmokeToo some people enjoy marksmen champs, but dont like going botlane.
[0:33:48] kappadarudesandstorm: did the voices ever leave @IKeepItTaco
[0:34:01] KayXOTV: huh
[0:34:03] Lenox14: forsenInsane the voices !!! TheVoices
[0:34:05] flux3003: HUH
[0:34:11] kappadarudesandstorm: good shiit
[0:34:12] zipztah: wat? what voices
[0:34:15] AliensSmokeToo: @demonminer3 but its not efficient if uwant to escape ranks
[0:34:18] kappadarudesandstorm: always let the voices win over you brother
[0:34:19] MihaiOSS: xdd
[0:34:29] kappadarudesandstorm: no matter what always let them win for the love of god
[0:34:35] the_warp_enjhin: xdd CAUGHT
[0:34:57] bruzer0: no one saw anything
[0:35:00] demonminer3: @AliensSmokeToo true. but the person asked about going mid with adcs
[0:35:11] MihaiOSS: udyr is wintrading probably AINTNOWAY
[0:35:25] KayXOTV: throwing
[0:35:35] kappadarudesandstorm: I KEEP IT VOICING

[0:37:32] KayXOTV: jhin?
[0:37:36] Mangbeat: Cute throw
[0:37:56] the_warp_enjhin: Tragedy
[0:38:12] demonminer3: @kappadarudesandstorm oh yeah, i know it's a skill issue on my part. bel is worth a ban if you dont play her
[0:38:24] kappadarudesandstorm: nah the champ is crazy
[0:38:44] kappadarudesandstorm: @IKeepItTaco check it

[2:35:51] Mcbensky: not suprised
[2:35:55] mcegginton: @Mcbensky It's more of a change, they buff base stats and nerf the abilities

[2:37:03] laikanangel: @mcegginton For sure. The balance team actually specified in the patch notes (some time ago) that they were afraid of touching him, even if he was good, because people were still learning him. Now though, they totally will tone him down

[2:39:37] mcegginton: @mcegginton I'm honestly fine with a Hwei nerf he should have more skill expression than just stat checking everybody like he's doing now
[2:39:59] dahmstein: I may be getting a webcam in the future, so stay tuned.  @IKeepItTaco when Mr Taco when
[2:40:04] mcegginton: IMO his biggest problem is that his cooldowns are way too low in the midgame so he can spam like five Qs per fight and it's overwhelming
[2:40:14] CictorGabriel: this kog maw ult bro
[2:40:16] awa0904: yommus or cyclosword first?

[3:51:24] fabexino: Well,Illaoi is getting quality of life buff so that's good
[3:51:29] mr_kimon: wtf this has never happened to meahahahah
[3:51:45] fabexino: Because terrain change kinda fucked up her passive positions
[3:51:59] lethalbonsai: i followed you so we can exchange discords
[3:52:07] browy_eu: imagine giving teemo a qol buff ikeepitSMILERS
[3:52:12] lethalbonsai: @fabexino no her passive got buffed
[3:52:16] lethalbonsai: 125% range
[3:52:17] mr_kimon: thats a thing?
[3:52:24] lethalbonsai: its basically the same now
[3:52:27] fabexino: I know
[3:52:35] fabexino: Because of new terrain
[3:52:37] nickdikk: i love playing aphelios but I think OTP him kept me in platinum. shall i play something more simple like Jinx to climb easier?
[3:52:49] fabexino: Tentacles were too far away from middle of lane
[3:52:52] lethalbonsai: @fabexino ive been illaoi main when she got released
[3:53:00] lethalbonsai: and when i play top on flex
[3:53:06] lethalbonsai: i always win with her
[3:53:08] learningmachinelearning: !opgg
[3:53:09] Nightbot: (NA) https://www.deeplol.gg/multi/NA/Flash%204th%20Shot%2CJhindiana%20Jones%2Cdeadeye44 (EUW) https://www.deeplol.gg/summoner/euw/%C6%92our
[3:53:11] lethalbonsai: even with ne map
[3:53:12] fabexino: So they are kinda useless in lane with new terrain
[3:53:18] wwaterbearer: probably because of nauti?
[3:53:21] lethalbonsai: @fabexino not at all
[3:53:26] nickdikk: i love playing aphelios but I think OTP him kept me in platinum. shall i play something more simple like Jinx to climb easier?
[3:53:29] mr_kimon: bro how am i supposed to find u im clueless
[3:53:32] wwaterbearer: otherwise you have a frontline he should go a little more squish
[3:53:39] mr_kimon: ok u know what i followed u
[3:53:40] lethalbonsai: with new buff she can hit you with 3 passives at same time
[3:53:59] mr_kimon: mr_kimon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:54:07] fabexino: I've played plenty of Illaoi last season @lethalbonsai
[3:54:25] fabexino: Iceborn Hullbreaker abusing funfunfun
[3:54:39] lethalbonsai: im very good at adapting to changes and as soon as they buffed her passive range i was smashing toplaners again
[3:54:47] lethalbonsai: there is basically 0 difference
[3:54:58] lethalbonsai: in fact it seems easier for illaoi now
[3:55:08] fabexino: But they removed Divine
[3:55:14] learningmachinelearning: oh no don’t opgg your supp ikeepitSMILERS
[3:55:15] fabexino: Sundered Sky is overrated
[3:55:18] lethalbonsai: wider lane means if enemy chose to kill passives he goes out of possition
[3:55:22] lethalbonsai: and 90% dead
[3:55:28] fabexino: And Iceborn is still the best Sheen item probably
[3:55:37] fabexino: Unless you go Trinity
[3:55:53] fabexino: But Iceborn slow so E is easier to hit is better
[3:55:55] lethalbonsai: with new changes illaoi is better imo
[3:55:56] KayXOTV: No blood song is
[3:56:19] lethalbonsai: whoever chose to hit passive will have to go out of possition and easier for illaoi to trade and win it
[3:56:50] fabexino: Would you go Iceborn or Trinity? @lethalbonsai
[3:56:58] itserklol: Ablazeolive popping off
[3:57:35] the_warp_enjhin: TSM TSM
[3:57:56] lethalbonsai: @fabexino iceborn
[3:58:03] browy_eu: Taco being carried by pros poggers
[3:58:03] mr_kimon: i just made an internet friend from a twitch chat nahhh
[3:58:26] lethalbonsai: trinity is good but i think iceborn is better cuz of passive

[3:58:42] coreyelle: HI TACO HI CHAT ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH ikeepitROACH
