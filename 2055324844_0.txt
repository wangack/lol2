[0:30:22] SalemPulsifer: @jaxkmurphy learning to be a game dev? :D
[0:30:23] 3eetle: you go to school to be conditioned to be a good taxpayer, thats life!
[0:30:32] jaxkmurphy: @salempulsifer yes.
[0:30:44] viivi7: Just read a really heady philosopy book, and pitch it like you 20% understand it.  you can feel and look smart to people with onlyu 10% of the work
[0:30:45] Oglino: BASED
[0:30:46] SalemPulsifer: @jaxkmurphy At least, the industry will be recruiting again soon
[0:30:49] wingedillidan: $50k flight sim setup tho
[0:30:57] Melamamoduro: @3eetle yet you never learn how to do taxes

[0:33:19] Uncertain_Fool: the egg chair
[0:33:19] SalemPulsifer: @DoubleGambit13 it depends a lot on the country. For example, I'm in Belgium and it's a country in which a diploma is required for a lot of job, just like "unlock"

[0:35:20] SalemPulsifer: @DoubleGambit13 sorry to hear that. Personally, I'm quite annoyed. I'm a High School Graduate, working as an external Consultant for the governement. BUt I would like to do the same job but Internally : not possible because I don't have the diploma
[0:35:25] Oglino: AAAA
[0:35:26] DirtyPotato: squawk

[0:38:16] SalemPulsifer: @DoubleGambit13 Ot it's the SAME job. Just that officially, this job would require, internally, for someone to have a college diploma. But externally, there is no requirement, I just convinced the recruiter I could do the job. ANd fun fact, they recruited me as a consultant because they had 0 people applying for the position internally
