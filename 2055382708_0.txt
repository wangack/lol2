[7:20:24] OGTJordan: Smolder got that smussy
[7:20:24] Spudn1ckel: @moosE3knucklE this champ does not scale nearly as well as other infinite scalers, he is too low range and his e is a terrible ability
[7:20:27] SpaghettiEnthousiast: @reetyt really? What the f?
[7:20:39] ZetMe: @Spudn1ckel coping, his Q is insane
[7:20:44] xenonamous: yes, essence navori then ldr if needed, then rapid, or reverse 3/4 like you are
[7:20:46] jeej___: FirstTimeChatter
[7:20:48] Smoot1e: Spudn1ckel And that's why RFC exists
[7:20:52] moosE3knucklE: @Spudn1ckel HIS E is for movement not damage.
[7:20:54] tomilobotomi: @Spudn1ckel  what? his E is actually nuts spell
[7:20:58] Rykati: navori is good. shjoen is good too if u want the health route.
[7:21:04] ZetMe: his E also gives vision over terrain

[7:21:32] moosE3knucklE: hes balanced if anything
[7:21:34] tomilobotomi: i wouldnt say this champ is really op but hes well balanced and good imo
[7:21:42] Crendog: If smoulder is so OP why does he go 5/17 in my normal games???
[7:21:42] ZetMe: @PekinWoof his winrate is climbing every single day as players cook less and less
[7:21:42] cuffmcgruff: you said his E is a bad ability, which is just not true
[7:21:46] Nightbot: Check out Pobelter's YouTube where he uploads highlights of his most exciting games and moments! https://www.youtube.com/user/Pobelt

[7:24:14] Smoot1e: It's actually the opposite, smolder is so bad in lower elos cuz ppl can't farm and stack for shit
[7:24:19] Smoot1e: unlike higher elo
[7:24:27] ever_relax: @TheEmsleyan agreed
[7:24:32] xenonamous: its good in 5 man fights. does a lot
[7:24:36] kricgang: ye but lowelo games last long on the other hand
[7:24:37] ZetMe: but more games go long in low elo
[7:24:38] 3goldenboy3: @Pobelter  you can Q the melee minions so you dont have to weaken them again with more Qs

[7:39:49] JustNoo0b: @Pobelter u have 225 stacks right when second item is done, usually, so u might need RFC if u need to higher Q range
[7:39:52] theoilbaron98: that a aheavy ap team
[7:39:54] Jebempte: ADHD
[7:39:54] PekinWoof: The two smolder hidden builds imo are either Lifesteal or Rift/Liandries/Shojin

[7:40:01] luizio2: @thoughtfulcoconut i think so too
[7:40:02] PekinWoof: still trash champ though

[7:40:44] luizio2: Smolders mom
[7:40:45] thoughtfulcoconut: @JustNoo0b but if you're spacing, landing W and using E, you're always in range to Q and auto. plus by the time you're getting RFC, you've already upgraded Q at least once. it's not a good item
[7:40:46] renaldey: how many hidden op synergy items do you think is still not discovered ?

[8:07:22] brandoniannn: yea honestly yone feels gross right now
[8:07:27] chipncheese: Corki... ResidentSleeper
[8:07:32] trio1000: Mr streamer I have a class today about public speaking. Do you think what you do is the same
[8:07:35] brandoniannn: his e duration should probably get a nerf a bit for sure
[8:07:41] krille9999: GOATED HEIMER PLAYER
[8:07:44] brandoniannn: it lasts so long
[8:07:59] Akimeris: @brandoniannn not true
[8:08:00] brandoniannn: botrk shieldbow ie feels so good too
[8:08:11] Crendog: Yone on my aram team yesterday died 28 times - definitely felt disgusting
[8:08:21] brandoniannn: @akimeris i mean dzukill even says his champ is busted af
[8:08:22] Akimeris: My gf said 10 seconds aint that long @brandoniannn
[8:08:23] sxk_1: @trio1000 he held a speech when he got rank 1 EZ i will remeber it ........
[8:08:32] Smegnite: i want to punch smolder in the face
[8:08:37] luizio2: Close rimworld LUL
[8:08:42] BuNu_TTV: @brandoniannn Yone is, and has been gross for a while now. Its not that he boasts a super big winrate, but the champ is just allowed to get away with so many mistakes its so frustrating to play against him. Thats why people hate him so much. He can miss Q, miss R, misstime E but still murder you with 3 autos
[8:08:51] brandoniannn: @akimeris 10 seconds is a compliment
[8:08:52] RareChill: this matchup is so easy after first base
[8:08:52] aspennu: Chatting
[8:09:07] BuNu_TTV: @cassence Always :D
[8:09:13] aspennu: hehe <3
[8:09:13] Euheimr: ya cause yone has no counterplay Clueless
[8:09:15] tomilobotomi: @RareChill  what do you mean easy? its free farm for vex
[8:09:16] Gnomaahh: @Pobelter Any mid laners that stand out or seem "op" right now?
[8:09:28] Akimeris: Yone is just tross because of the lethal tempo rework, because of that he is a strong champ since lvl 1 already
[8:09:43] trio1000: Fk yeah I'ma model my speech on wether he w or L this game. Earn your legacy Mr streamer
[8:09:43] brandoniannn: yee lethal tempo also makes him way stronger no doubt
[8:09:45] Tomcat0208: Tomcat0208 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! :)
[8:09:45] Akimeris: Before he wasnt big of a deal until 2 items with conq or fleet

[8:10:03] OnlyPidgeon: what are you eating, pob ? lp ?
[8:10:03] kuxalul: lol they actually buffed mao?
[8:10:03] Frothar: yone only has a low win rate because it's easy to make ego plays and throw.
[8:10:05] kasetta: True, lethal tempo has made him and yasuo so strong
[8:10:05] brandoniannn: i still just think e nerf on duration would be fair
[8:10:06] sxk_1: 0-0
[8:10:14] JamesTyson161: Yone when hullbreaker was strong was gross sure. But now he is fine, he does load of dmg but are squishy
[8:10:16] anthonydavoli: can you show us your settings after this game
[8:10:22] Euheimr: i mean, i think they should remove E movespeed all together
[8:10:51] trio1000: !
[8:10:53] Euheimr: make it so you gotta itemize to catch up to people
[8:11:01] kasetta: bring back frozen mallet
[8:11:02] huanpc: fighting
[8:11:20] kasetta: serylda is not worth it
[8:11:45] BuNu_TTV: @JamesTyson161 Jeh im probably just biased af since i main Aurelion. But still, i dont like him >:/
[8:11:51] brandoniannn: vex apparently one of the yone counters

[8:12:01] OnlyPidgeon: why are you bullying the emo kid, pob ?
[8:12:05] BigNerdT: man drinking potions like it's water
[8:12:14] Euheimr: @JamesTyson161 that says more about hull than it does about yone tbh
[8:12:27] kasetta: new hullbreaker on trundle is insane
[8:12:42] kasetta: combined with demolish and triforce LUL
[8:12:47] BuNu_TTV: @kasetta ---------- trundle is insane
[8:12:48] Euheimr: hullbreaker is just a bad item for a tower defense game
[8:13:07] kasetta: but sadly not many people know how to play with trundle or yorick Sadge
[8:13:09] Euheimr: makes balancing it practically impossible
[8:13:12] Spudn1ckel: yeah that seems balanced

[8:13:38] xg32: full build yone, here we go
[8:13:38] JamesTyson161: @Euheimr Yone problem i think is when he build stuff where he can both survive while dealing dmg. Iceborn gauntlet + bork build rn kind simulate the old build but it is not as strong
[8:14:00] kasetta: boots acquired, its gg
[8:14:30] BuNu_TTV: @Euheimr @JamesTyson161 Also the fact you cant really itemize against him. 50% Magic 50% physical and his E deals truedamage

[8:15:29] brandoniannn: kraken ie still good for 1v9 or kraken shieldbow ie, but botrk shieldbow ie feels so good
[8:15:42] brandoniannn: just always want kraken or shieldbow before ie basically
[8:16:07] JamesTyson161: @BubbaYT IMO His counter are tabi, frozen heart,randuin, thorn mail but they are all tank items so it feels like you can't itemized vs him. But i understand your point
