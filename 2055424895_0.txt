[0:12:56] wilsonao: Good, bad, he is in God's hands now
[0:14:49] wilsonao: Behold the Smold!
[0:16:28] wilsonao: Idk but it was clean
[0:18:09] medisinskapet: you don't like trailblazer?
[0:18:32] medisinskapet: yes, but people still rush it on mao
[0:19:19] wilsonao: Classic Leona
[0:22:37] RevJim_Jones: guy posted on twitter about it

[0:22:54] Smipims: it's the tech
[0:27:18] Apfelranz: actually think its one of his weakest states right before he hits 225 stacks for the burn
[0:29:32] PrimeStrategy: god dang
[0:30:49] salecc: good lord I cant regonize half of the items you have nowdays
[0:31:36] tastycales: Feels good to finaly actually have to think during the game on what items are best to build
[0:32:08] salecc: Holy are the new items that deep that it actually matters what you build
[0:33:25] salecc: Is league good/fun nowdays? Last time I played it was like season 8 or something
[0:34:39] salecc: Fun is kinda all you need from games when not tryharding pro etc
[0:34:48] disquared: !gamble 100
[0:34:48] StreamElements: disquared lost 100 Saints in roulette and now has 561 Saints! FeelsBadMan
[0:34:59] dkvukster: fiddle
[0:35:05] dkvukster: xdd
[0:35:08] salecc: I vote Shyvana
[0:36:55] salecc: Do you still get all the skins and champs for free to your account?
[0:38:14] nomadic_hobo: They usually take ghost
[0:38:38] salecc: This Brand skin kinda looks like that god Lee skin
[0:38:43] Dragonslave49: take flash and ghost 4Head
[0:38:47] philleotardonewyork: why brand jungle
[0:38:49] LucasRulzZ: I was so close to say: shaco supp, dia jungle, twitch mid and smolder adc xdd
[0:38:56] tastycales: malignance seems destructive on teamfights too
[0:39:31] Dragonslave49: is it liandry's or something else for brand of the jungle?
[0:39:53] salecc: But what the hell now this skin looks nothing like in loading screen
[0:40:42] medisinskapet: XDD
[0:40:42] Smipims: lol wtf
[0:40:52] Nikademous: oh hell yea brand jungle
[0:41:32] LucasRulzZ: He has the black chroma @salecc (idk if chroma is the correct word xdd )
[0:42:27] AddOneMoreThing: Oh shit you are jungling
[0:42:28] compucrazy: compucrazy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! I haven't played regular league in like 3 years. When I did Brand was my favorite Mid/support champ. How the hell did he become a top tier jungler?
[0:43:32] AddOneMoreThing: Can brand actually play all roles rn?
[0:43:51] Nikademous: i mean technically anything can right
[0:44:02] compucrazy: How long has brand been a jungler? wth?
[0:44:09] tastycales: tastycales subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Lit them up
[0:44:34] Nikademous: think it got popular this patch but not sure comp
[0:45:10] compucrazy: I feel like I've been in a coma for hundred years. How did my forgotten, Mid/support suddenly become good at jungling lol.
[0:45:25] Nikademous: the new items i tihnk has alot to do with it
[0:45:30] Dragonslave49: what the hell are those thing? what happened to rift herald?
[0:45:35] Nikademous: but again im no brand pro
[0:45:37] compucrazy: I guess so.
[0:45:49] compucrazy: I don't even know the new items tbh.
[0:45:56] compucrazy: I never play league anymore lol
[0:46:21] Nikademous: me either to toxic
[0:46:48] compucrazy: I assume the reason brand didn't work in previous years was he got mauled by monsters.
[0:46:53] ebCAPS: Saintvicious? the best Jarvan in the world??
[0:47:20] compucrazy: Maybe monsters don't hurt as much?
[0:48:13] Surpriseigloo: @saintvicious is your name in any way in relation to the boondock saints? I feel like you're of an age with me, where that could've been an early game name influence
[0:48:37] sunsetage: nobody is happy with their lane
[0:48:46] AddOneMoreThing: if he takes top camps then you won't have a reason to go top lol
[0:48:52] Nikademous: yea shit is cringe
[0:49:32] Surpriseigloo: lol
[0:49:34] Surpriseigloo: taxed
[0:50:00] bradnickley: guy is cringe
[0:50:02] AddOneMoreThing: olaf never collapsed
[0:50:03] bradnickley: holy
[0:50:05] compucrazy: When I left league, 50% of the game was playing therapist to your teammates. At least that hasn't changed lol.
[0:50:13] Surpriseigloo: I hate getting players like Top. Just tilt lord babies.
[0:50:19] evilcise1234: most stable league of legends top laner
[0:50:31] Nikademous: true
[0:50:44] Viikiing1234: Viikiing1234 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! cheers
[0:51:01] tastycales: its easier to live with yourself if you blame jungler
[0:51:05] bradnickley: winner's mentality
[0:51:35] Nikademous: watta lmaokai
[0:51:44] Nikademous: amirite?
[0:51:44] theGESofIT: shit is so toxic, this is why league turns people off from playing
[0:52:51] compucrazy: missing W feels so bad as brand.
[0:52:54] Nikademous: trist sleeping
[0:52:59] Nikademous: coulda cleaned that all up
[0:54:08] Surpriseigloo: this Olaf is something else.
[0:55:12] Surpriseigloo: What sucks is... now that you know Olaf isn't trustworthy, the top side of the map is untouchable.
[0:56:11] miguelangelthelittleduck: @saintvicious is there a possibility we might see you jungle :p
[0:56:56] Nikademous: dont trigger him michael
[0:57:47] nomadic_hobo: Smolders got some ratios in his kit
[0:58:34] miguelangelthelittleduck: Oh I feel so silly I thought when you were botlane you were support brand sorry I just got here woohoo!!! Jungle StVicious!
[0:59:19] wilsonao: So sassy
[1:00:00] wafflesrrdank: brand jg is meta
[1:00:14] wilsonao: Saint why dont you play jungle anymore? Kappa
[1:00:16] Dragonslave49: yoru maokai is not waiting for good engages
[1:01:39] herpaderpaa: !comps
[1:01:39] StreamElements: Set 10 Comp List  https://imgur.com/a/BdlH94V
[1:01:56] wilsonao: That's an NA support right there
[1:02:07] wafflesrrdank: God bless NA
[1:02:14] KibbleNibbles: Its smoldering time!
[1:02:41] wilsonao: Mega losers queue game
[1:02:47] Surpriseigloo: if... he's an ADC... why not just play an ADC champ mid?
[1:03:00] Surpriseigloo: like... can kaisa APC not mid?
[1:03:18] AddOneMoreThing: Smolder jg
[1:03:19] wilsonao: Off role games are for chilling and getting carried
[1:03:43] Nikademous: wonder why
[1:03:45] AddOneMoreThing: Yeah, because everyone blames the jg
[1:03:45] Nikademous: kekw
[1:03:50] angahax: ikts cause u get flamed
[1:03:53] angahax: by everyone
[1:03:53] Surpriseigloo: I ALWAYS get jg. It sucks ass. Every game is "your fault" lol
[1:04:05] wilsonao: There's no voice comms so communication sucks
[1:04:08] Surpriseigloo: yeah, there's no alternate routes.
[1:04:47] miguelangelthelittleduck: That's why it's so impressive when beyond all the adversities you still triumph it's like tremendous pressure to create diamond type stuff xD
[1:05:02] Saffiz: He's an ape
[1:05:11] Dragonslave49: twitch ad algorithm has decided I'm a spanish speaking woman
[1:05:13] wilsonao: This was 100% impossible to avoid
[1:05:26] AddOneMoreThing: He is a moron
[1:05:38] AddOneMoreThing: Huge
[1:05:47] Surpriseigloo: he's bad at olaf. Max ranging his Q's.
[1:05:55] Surpriseigloo: he's throwing his axe out of reach.
[1:05:56] compucrazy: Being a jungler is basically playing a video game while being a therapist.
[1:05:59] wilsonao: Had to fight in enemy creep wave no other choice
[1:06:29] Dragonslave49: run straight into the bush vs garen
[1:06:31] wilsonao: The further you are from top the runner the game is
[1:06:36] wilsonao: Funner
[1:06:40] Saffiz: League Players SeemsGood
[1:07:11] Surpriseigloo: @wilsonao dumber! KappaPride
[1:07:11] AddOneMoreThing: yes
[1:07:19] Saffiz: he should just truck that lane
[1:07:22] AddOneMoreThing: You just back and dominate
[1:07:22] Surpriseigloo: actually "dummer"
[1:08:40] Surpriseigloo: JG's job isn't to fix lanes... it's to help winning lanes get even fatter. If someone is throwing leads, they shouldn't expect help since they've proven to be unreliable.
[1:09:13] Surpriseigloo: In Solo Q at least.
[1:09:44] Surpriseigloo: it's an Ezreal
[1:09:48] Surpriseigloo: he's just gonna last hit Q
[1:10:04] AddOneMoreThing: he just wants to get his tea
[1:10:32] Dragonslave49: do people do divine sunderer on ez or something else?

[1:15:02] Nikademous: fire and ice baby
[1:15:05] Nikademous: we cant lose

[1:17:08] wilsonao: I don't think smoulder is ever allowed to be on enemy team
[1:17:16] kayywang: it used to be 2300.  2600 for umbral or 2700 for ghost blade
[1:17:32] johnsmith37: umbral bis
[1:17:37] johnsmith37: saves you time
[1:17:46] kidlink70: its only buildable because your support tbh
[1:18:00] wilsonao: It's free real estate

[2:18:55] kit_cakez: smoldering time PepeHands
[2:19:13] wilsonao: Feels old, is studying, does not check out
[2:19:26] Surpriseigloo: To be fair, you took ONE CS. That's grounds for throwing at least 30minutes away.
[2:19:32] Nikademous: i dont think english is his first language
[2:21:30] Nikademous: LMAO
[2:21:37] Nikademous: a child

[2:23:44] kit_cakez: mid is the goat banning smolder FeelsGoodMan
[2:23:49] CheckYorSix: but vibes are one thing
[2:23:49] Nikademous: well that sucks
[2:23:50] AtJBerg: With Saint, what you see is what you get!
[2:23:52] Fortinbras1: SeemsGood
[2:23:54] AtJBerg: !wholesome
[2:23:54] StreamElements: Saint has been wholesome for 3 minutes!
[2:23:55] CheckYorSix: still, he doesn't stream anymore does he?
[2:23:59] WhyWorry07: Better to be openly toxic and pick singed support
[2:24:05] dkvukster: i just dont talk alot in general.. i do with my gaming mates but out im public i dont talk alot
[2:24:07] elessar__telcontar: smite8

[2:26:25] AtJBerg: "Team player"
[2:26:27] Surpriseigloo: If he signed a contract, why did he have to take a paycut? Was the organization struggling?
[2:26:29] wilsonao: Where the duck is smolder
[2:26:34] init_01: When the drama start I just want youtube to know I was here
[2:26:43] Nikademous: it was banned wilson

[2:26:46] nomadic_hobo: Gotta respect the hustle though
[2:27:25] Surpriseigloo: That definitely won't make for good team dynamics.
[2:27:28] Roarus: famine mentality
[2:27:35] Pipomasterlaleshenda: Pipomasterlaleshenda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! Hello
[2:27:39] Cris: wait who did that?
[2:27:45] Surpriseigloo: voyboy
[2:27:47] dkvukster: that is just bad for business - it cost money to make money
[2:27:55] elessar__telcontar: that’s sad. I always rooted for y’all
[2:27:56] Fortinbras1: dang thrown under the bus like that EleGiggle
[2:28:06] Surpriseigloo: nah he shined a light under the bus
[2:28:12] Surpriseigloo: and saw the teammates that were tossed under there
[2:28:23] Cris: he was hustlin bro
[2:28:35] Roarus: hahah
[2:28:39] Surpriseigloo: he was standin' on business bro
[2:28:42] Nikademous: explains alot tho
[2:28:52] elessar__telcontar: the bus of truth?
[2:28:54] Nikademous: and u add chaox in there
[2:29:00] dkvukster: is it Jhin supp ?
[2:29:05] dkvukster: or the rat ?
[2:29:20] AtJBerg: Playing Bard into Jhin is so fun, Jhin doesn't get to ult lmao
[2:29:22] Roarus: the stunna
[2:29:39] LeiteroMasta: but if he could even decide that means that liquid fucked up the contracts, no?
[2:29:41] Surpriseigloo: @dkvukster rat supp
[2:30:14] LeiteroMasta: oh renegotiations? yeah that's fucked up lol
[2:30:14] dkvukster: gotcha
[2:30:18] LordAudacity: I aint mad at someone for making as much as they could, but i wouldnt want to hang with the guy
[2:30:30] Surpriseigloo: too busy talkin' about the bus
[2:30:51] elessar__telcontar: I miss when all the pros streamed. hard to care about players without knowing them
[2:30:58] wilsonao: Azubu was such a scam lol
[2:31:12] hamelsky: I mean karma prolly bite him in the ass later
[2:31:22] Surpriseigloo: basically voyboy was kinda greedy and wouldn't give up a minor amount of money that would've allowed everyone to do well. Instead he insisted on getting his max amount which submarined shit. It's a bad look.
[2:31:25] init_01: Why didn't you just take more of a paycut Kappa
[2:31:50] CheckYorSix: I think people thought he was a "good guy" because he went after that other streamer for their pedo like tendencies or something
[2:32:09] Cris: so you tellin me you wouldnt of done it for the $$$?
[2:32:18] Spiker222: does anyone talk to cop havent seen that man tweet or stream in what feels like forever
[2:32:32] Roarus: but he likes spongebob :/
[2:32:40] Anders092: hash has always been a whiny child
[2:33:18] Nikademous: no anders he like swhiny childs
[2:33:27] init_01: He likes spongebob omg he's just like me fr!
[2:33:32] Cris: na son you woulda kept the money too dont lie
[2:33:45] LordAudacity: fake nice is like every professional relationship
[2:33:48] CheckYorSix: there were a lot of streamers of league I used to watch and for one reason or another just stopped
[2:33:56] Rhuid: who the fuck thinks they're worth 8x every other teammate
[2:34:01] Rhuid: that's some shit
[2:34:17] CheckYorSix: Voyboy, Hashinshin, WingsofDeath, IWillDominate, and others
[2:34:29] elessar__telcontar: not that many original league streamers left now
[2:34:59] nomadic_hobo: Voyboy is Mr Pink irl
[2:35:06] elessar__telcontar: I tune in wings occasionally but they are not the same
[2:35:19] prophaniti86: wai who used to never tip?
[2:35:29] CheckYorSix: I personally HATE the tipping thing even though I did a lot of tip based jobs. However, I know that not tipping is basically stealing from those people since they don't get a real hourly wage if it is a tip jpb
[2:35:29] Nikademous: voyboy
[2:35:42] prophaniti86: what a piece of shit
[2:36:05] elessar__telcontar: I hate tipping but I still do it
[2:36:19] CheckYorSix: things I don't tip much or not for are for jobs I know the person is getting a normal hourly wage
[2:36:39] elessar__telcontar: though I will tip to round numbers so i will leave weird tips
[2:36:39] Nikademous: was a server all thru college
[2:36:42] Nikademous: i always tip
[2:36:47] Surpriseigloo: I tip all the time and well.
[2:36:49] prophaniti86: i say that as someone who used to never tip, i honestly had no idea until someone told me
[2:36:58] Surpriseigloo: If you don't tip, make your own food, or shop for your own groceries
[2:37:00] Catchinthesehands: @Surpriseigloo even with trash service ?
[2:37:05] elessar__telcontar: I’m
[2:37:07] Nikademous: yes
[2:37:23] AtJBerg: If a company wants you to pay their employees for them, they should have to advertise clearly that they pay a sub minimum wage salary
[2:37:23] CheckYorSix: I mean a coffee barista? Not putting a tip in that jar as I know they are making good money without it.
[2:37:30] JoshIcy: How much of a tip?
[2:37:32] Surpriseigloo: @Surpriseigloo yes. But I'll talk to their manager or ask them how they want to rectify the behavior or I can leave a review
[2:37:35] CheckYorSix: waiter? barkeep? I'm tipping though
[2:37:43] CheckYorSix: pizza delivery? Also tiping
[2:37:49] LordAudacity: did u ult?
[2:37:52] Surpriseigloo: 20% at least.
[2:37:58] prophaniti86: bad service gets a low tip, but thats about it
[2:38:13] Catchinthesehands: @Surpriseigloo if someone cannot do there job correctly they dont deserve a tip
[2:38:23] Roarus: lol the old twist screen and tip
[2:38:35] Surpriseigloo: @Catchinthesehands if you dont want to tip, then don't get a service that you can't afford.
[2:38:38] wilsonao: They roaming to us
[2:39:00] Catchinthesehands: @Surpriseigloo why would u tip someone for doing a bad job. can u explain it
[2:39:14] Catchinthesehands: rewarding someone for doing bad is weird
[2:39:16] Surpriseigloo: @Surpriseigloo because it's part of the 'deal'
[2:39:29] prophaniti86: because i get paid for doing a bad job
[2:39:38] prophaniti86: least i can do is pass it along lol
[2:39:43] Catchinthesehands: @Surpriseigloo u as the customer have no deal with a restaurant ?
[2:39:44] CheckYorSix: I also used to work as a bouncer for a club long ago. I got both hourly and tips. On good nights the tips were far more than the hourly wage. If I didn't make any tips I wasn't upset though.
[2:39:59] LordAudacity: @Surpriseigloo thinks its the customers job to go above and beyond
[2:40:00] Catchinthesehands: @prophaniti86 not me when i go to work i put in a 100
[2:40:05] Surpriseigloo: @Surpriseigloo listen you're cheap, accept it. Just understand who you are.
[2:40:14] Nikademous: some states have a far lower minimum wage for service jobs
[2:40:34] prophaniti86: I think thats the biggest lie ive ever heard
[2:40:39] CheckYorSix: @Nikademous it's federal law. Tip wage is always 2.13 an hour.
[2:40:48] Nikademous: not truer
[2:40:52] Catchinthesehands: @Surpriseigloo if thats what u think i tip good for people who do there job correctly. but im not finna tip bad service
[2:40:57] Roarus: wat
[2:40:59] wilsonao: A lot of restaurants do that now
[2:41:00] Surpriseigloo: that's fine
[2:41:08] okaynuckles: thats because their salary was now taxable
[2:41:09] Surpriseigloo: not sure why you're all heated
[2:41:10] CheckYorSix: @Nikademous https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped
[2:41:11] Nikademous: here in Cali its regular minimum
[2:41:13] thedeaniuss: Nice example. Now look at every country that isn't the US LMAO
[2:41:15] Surpriseigloo: that I always tip for services rendered
[2:41:19] CheckYorSix: It is literally federal law int he USA
[2:41:24] Quachoo: My roommate is a bartender and makes well over 35 an hour
[2:41:24] okaynuckles: you dont have to claim all your tips wink wink
[2:41:25] LeiteroMasta: gotta gamble your livelyhood that's the american way
[2:41:27] CheckYorSix: I linked the dot gov site for it
[2:41:28] NaraKaiden: that style is good for most of the staff except the servers
[2:41:28] prophaniti86: yup, tips usually almost always outdo the hourly
[2:41:31] Catchinthesehands: naw im not was just wondering i see ur view just dont agree and thats fine
[2:41:37] NaraKaiden: but the servers want theirs
[2:41:39] Nikademous: i understand that but states have there  own laws
[2:41:42] Nikademous: u pleb
[2:41:47] Rgcommander: yeah everyone complains about servers being underpaid and customers subsidizing the company paying wages but the servers are most all in agreement they make more the way it is now
[2:41:48] CheckYorSix: If the person is working a tip wage job, they are getting 2.13 minimum
[2:41:54] Nikademous: bahhaha
[2:41:55] Nikademous: ok
[2:41:59] CheckYorSix: They can go above that, but not below Nik
[2:42:04] Nikademous: no such thing as state law
[2:42:05] prophaniti86: shh guys, we're making him play bad
[2:42:07] CheckYorSix: 2.13 is the min based on federal law
[2:42:09] i_beebo: dogJAM
[2:42:10] itslaw62: bigfatchauDoge
[2:42:21] Nikademous: yes thats what im saying some states thats your hourly
[2:42:29] Nikademous: now image u dsont tip that persopn
[2:42:36] Surpriseigloo: All these VOYBOY trauma moments brought back up... saint is tilted now Kappa
[2:42:36] AtJBerg: How do you afford to breathe on 2.13?
[2:42:37] CheckYorSix: Min wage is stilll 7.25 at the federal level, but many states are above that
[2:42:42] AtJBerg: USA is fucked man
[2:43:01] wilsonao: That's for jobs with tip atjberg
[2:43:14] Nikademous: yes but popol dont HAVER to tip
[2:43:34] prophaniti86: dont forget the cute salary
[2:43:38] Nikademous: so going back to the guy who says he doewsnt tip, its kind of fucked up
[2:43:41] thedeaniuss: I spent $300 at a nice steakhouse last weekend and didn't tip at all :) (I live in a country where companies are made to actually pay their employees rather than making it my job)
[2:43:42] AtJBerg: @wilsonao sure.. but in Canada, tip wage is still 12$
[2:43:43] prophaniti86: the better looking you are, the more you make in tips
[2:43:45] LordAudacity: i think tipping is dependent on the service- but its not required
[2:43:48] AtJBerg: 2.13 is cursed
[2:43:54] nasaruinz: if you don't meet the minimum wage with your tips by the law restaurant has to pay you min wage so its not exactly 2.13
[2:44:00] Catchinthesehands: @Nikademous who said that. thats lame
[2:44:04] CheckYorSix: @AtJBerg By law tip wage jobs are paid 2.13 an hour regardless unless their earned reported tips don't mean the minimum of 7.25 an hour. If it does the employer must pay up the difference. Still, if an employer is doing that, they are firing that person. Also, not tipping a tip wage based job is basically stealing from that person for the work they are doing
[2:44:10] wilsonao: Tipping arguments Bedge
[2:44:19] Surpriseigloo: @Nikademous agreed.
[2:44:22] itslaw62: bigfatchauZzz bigfatchauZzz bigfatchauZzz
[2:45:14] AtJBerg: @CheckYorSix I don't understand how people can survive under these conditions, it's inhumane
[2:45:31] prophaniti86: i remember the first service job i had, was told i wouldn't make tips for 3 months so i completely didnt try at all. everyone on my shift got mad at me and it old them all i wasnt busting my ass to make them money
[2:45:35] CheckYorSix: what conditions? 7.25 an hour? I used to live on that when I was single back in the day
[2:45:40] Surpriseigloo: Gotta stand up, and crush billionaires
[2:45:54] thedeaniuss: Good take YEP
[2:45:56] Surpriseigloo: I prefer Germany's system of paying service folks a living wage.
[2:46:09] thedeaniuss: Don't punish the individual in the moment for a shit system.....but also don't defend it
[2:46:20] Surpriseigloo: @CheckYorSix good luck doing that now with rent skyrocketing.
[2:46:24] init_01: be the change you want to see in the world Kappa
[2:46:28] wilsonao: American servers make more overall that European ones
[2:46:40] wilsonao: So it's not like they are destitute
[2:46:42] Roarus: ye
[2:46:46] AtJBerg: @saintvicious how do you feel about tipping culture overtaking non tipping wage jobs?
[2:46:53] AtJBerg: exactly
[2:46:56] Catchinthesehands: @CheckYorSix feel like its kinda sad how restaurants dont have 2 pay u and its kinda make people feel bad for one
[2:46:58] Cassco: sir i need a 20$ tip for this message i just sent
[2:47:05] LordAudacity: @wilsonao price of living is higher in america than most of europe
[2:47:07] Nikademous: im a Dr, u should tip me
[2:47:11] CheckYorSix: @Surpriseigloo I can still find places for $500 a month here where I live. I helped a buddy get his kid into a place like that. They aren't very upscale, but they are very affordable still where I live
[2:47:13] Catchinthesehands: @saintvicious agreed people tip 2 tip even if not good service kinda weird
[2:47:22] prophaniti86: @Nikademous lol reminds me of Dr. Cox in Scrubs
[2:47:32] Nikademous: i love that show
[2:47:57] prophaniti86: was a fantastic show
[2:48:08] Surpriseigloo: @CheckYorSix god damn, well that's nice. I was trying to find some inexpensive housing for my MiL where I live and there ain't shiiiiiiiiiit
[2:48:19] kappakappalaw: team trollin
[2:48:24] wilsonao: @lordaudacity not enough to counter the overall higher pay in the USA
[2:48:29] itslaw62: this twitch is sprinting it lmao bigfatO
[2:48:39] CheckYorSix: @Surpriseigloo yah, if the area doesn't have housing that can support min wage, that place is fooked
[2:49:13] prophaniti86: @Nikademous You should watch the "fake doctors real friends with Zach and Don" podcast if you dont. Its literally Faison and Braff watching all of Scrubs for the first time
[2:49:18] Surpriseigloo: @CheckYorSix also depends on if blackrock has bought up all of the housing.
[2:49:35] Nikademous: omg ty
[2:49:41] Nikademous: i will tomorrow at work
[2:49:50] CheckYorSix: well min wage people aren't buying houses. I certainly wasn't even when I was on a min wage job 25 years ago
[2:50:04] wilsonao: Oh no people are bring up black rock conspiracies now kill me
[2:50:18] Surpriseigloo: @CheckYorSix except blackrock is buying up rentals too, and jacking prices up... they've focused on cornering the market entirely.
[2:50:23] Rhuid: the majority of single family homes in 2022-2023 were bought by hedge funds
[2:50:25] AtJBerg: So, lizard people, right?
[2:50:33] Surpriseigloo: Hedge funds in single family housing has fucked the market to hell.
[2:50:53] wilsonao: Oh God make it stop. Alright I am closing chat. I can't.
[2:50:57] Rhuid: nobody under the age of 30 is gonna be able to buy property
[2:50:58] prophaniti86: @Nikademous been going on for a few years, they on S08E15 now
[2:50:58] Nikademous: lol
[2:51:08] Nikademous: nice
[2:51:14] Surpriseigloo: lol sorry Wilson
[2:51:19] Xephride: wilson is a blackrock plant
[2:51:23] Surpriseigloo: clearly.
[2:51:40] LordAudacity: saint is somehow winning
[2:51:50] prophaniti86: we got off tipping lol
[2:52:09] Surpriseigloo: @saintvicious except it didn't look the same when boomers were millenial's ages
[2:52:17] Surpriseigloo: so unfortunately the comparison isn't apt.
[2:52:20] Rhuid: nah even if you compare the same age generationally, the boomers have way more wealth than their parents did at their age
[2:52:32] prophaniti86: we 40 now
[2:52:33] Surpriseigloo: Millenials are the children of boomers.
[2:52:33] LordAudacity: 25-40
[2:52:36] Rhuid: and they're holding onto it and won't fuckin die
[2:52:47] wilsonao: The difference can mostly be explained by 2008
[2:52:50] TheLoho: @LordAudacity 25? My man. It's 28 at the LOWEST for Millenials
[2:53:07] wilsonao: For what those charts looked like now vs 40 years ago
[2:53:11] Rhuid: I just don't want my rent going up 10%+ every fuckin year man
[2:53:14] prophaniti86: shit im older than Saint lol
[2:53:23] AtJBerg: When they were my age, my parents had a house and were thinking about building a cottage with really well funded retirement funds. I am nowhere near any of those things
[2:53:24] wilsonao: Land Value Tax now!
[2:53:25] kit_cakez: 31 here
[2:53:57] wilsonao: At my age my parents were broke af
[2:54:04] Rhuid: when our parents were our age college was cheap and so was housing
[2:54:14] Nikademous: my parents are still broke af
[2:54:17] wilsonao: YeAh I could too
[2:54:20] nasaruinz: theres just a shit ton more people now
[2:54:20] Nikademous: i make wayy more then they ever did
[2:54:28] AtJBerg: wages vs cost of living now is much more expensive than then
[2:54:30] angahax: yeah theres a big difference now then when we were 12-15 years younger
[2:54:33] angahax: thats a bad take
[2:54:40] wilsonao: Everyone thinks they need to live in the most expensive areas of the country
[2:54:44] Nikademous: theres so many more tools ppl dont take advantage of
[2:54:56] angahax: nah thats a bad take
[2:54:58] prophaniti86: I wish i had pulled the trigger on a condo 10 years ago
[2:55:01] wilsonao: Zoning reform would fix a lot of housing costs
[2:55:09] wilsonao: Densification is supressed
[2:55:11] Xephride: nobody wants to live there though and the job market doesn't always allow for that
[2:55:19] Surpriseigloo: Montana isn't, unless you're in a place with no people. Look at Bozeman or Missoula
[2:55:23] robotSabotage: montana not the best example. rich costal people are moving there en masse and driving up real estate prices
[2:55:32] Nikademous: 2mill dollars
[2:55:32] kit_cakez: kids are giga expensive nowadays
[2:55:37] CheckYorSix: Homesteading still legal in the USA. There are places you can get free land and build your own house on still. Lots of the US are literally untouched and is free to actually take. But since there isn't many other people around most people don't do that.
[2:55:37] Nikademous: 1-18
[2:55:37] AtJBerg: @wilsonao preach. fuck single family home only zoning
[2:55:46] Rhuid: how many people do you know that can support a family of 4 on a single income these days
[2:55:51] angahax: i bought a house in 2010 for 180k that house is now worth 500k
[2:55:58] angahax: shit aint the same
[2:56:07] Sheshantol: Inflation and cost of living skyrocketed since back in the day
[2:56:12] wilsonao: Kids are pretty cheap outside of daycare which is crazy expensive but only for a few years
[2:56:15] AtJBerg: fucking car dependent dystopian subburbia
[2:56:17] Rhuid: that shit used to be normal and it sure isn't anymore
[2:56:23] Xephride: came to stream to watch slightly above mediocre jungle gameplay, instead getting depressed by economics FeelsBadMan
[2:56:43] Nikademous: my dad asked me one time "wtf is a YT millionair"
[2:56:49] LordAudacity: i agree- theres never been a better time to be your own boss and be a millionare
[2:56:54] prophaniti86: lemme tell you about the inflation of items in LoL
[2:57:04] Rhuid: work in tech and pray to god you don't get laid off every year
[2:57:19] AtJBerg: after paying 4$ for their college degree
[2:57:23] lebrongabes: hey i work at a coal factory its lit
[2:57:34] Xephride: getting famous from 0 as a streamer or content creator these days is basically like a lottery though, so much oversaturation
[2:57:46] eggys: yeah but Saint, you hit the lottery. the amount of successful streamers is <5% of the streamer population or less
[2:57:47] evilcise1234: There is a path to a good stable life for everyone in the trades if they are incapable of the academic requirements behind a degree.
[2:58:00] Nikademous: wasnt the lottery
[2:58:02] Nikademous: wtf
[2:58:05] Nikademous: he was a Pro
[2:58:06] nasaruinz: my buddy drives a concrete truck and guys there make six figures easy
[2:58:10] Nikademous: takew so much work
[2:58:25] Roarus: what else would you do? lol
[2:58:26] hamelsky: would still be in the navy
[2:58:26] Nikademous: eggys u trollin
[2:58:29] eggys: problem is that 6 figures hardly gets you anything anymore
[2:58:31] angahax: 6 figures aint shit
[2:58:38] lebrongabes: carried by hotshotgg
[2:58:45] Nikademous: ^LMAO
[2:58:47] Roarus: dr.saint
[2:59:00] Jamicaninamerica: I wish I had a wholesome de like saint
[2:59:03] AtJBerg: !wholesome
[2:59:03] Rordax100: dr. vicious
[2:59:03] StreamElements: Saint has been wholesome for 2 minutes!
[2:59:04] Rgcommander: uh.....
[2:59:05] prophaniti86: lol i remember maplestreet
[2:59:08] Nikademous: Dr dont have bed side manners that shit is for the RNs
[2:59:10] Xephride: imagine going to doctor brandon just to get flamed for ur sickness LUL
[2:59:14] itslaw62: hotshotGG and jiji carry bigfatSmile
[2:59:15] lebrongabes: sir ive seen ur bloodwork and youve been running it down
[2:59:15] Sheshantol: KEKW
[2:59:15] TheLoho: ngl your bedside manner would've made me die faster
[2:59:36] AtJBerg: you would have been so fucking bitter as a doctor, lmao
[2:59:41] Xephride: if saint dogs on his TFT viewers just imagine his cancer patients NotLikeThis
[2:59:42] Rgcommander: pretty sure Saints bedside manner would be the same as House's smiteLaugh
[2:59:42] Nikademous: hed walk in "its SMOLDERING TIME"
[2:59:53] prophaniti86: Saint woulda been Dr. Cox
[3:00:05] wilsonao: "Seen any good Pepegas?"
[3:00:09] Nikademous: proph u might have a crush
[3:00:15] prophaniti86: ... yes
[3:00:28] eggys: Saint would miss veins as much as he misses smites IMO, those poor patients
[3:00:48] eggys: /s
[3:00:55] AtJBerg: i'll get them next time!
[3:01:04] AtJBerg: patient looks like a fucking strainer
[3:01:42] CheckYorSix: sounds like you are still "smoldering" over those games

[3:13:25] LordAudacity: SMOLDERING TIME
[3:13:51] kit_cakez: bruh smolder is a cannon minion till 40 mins and ppl still pick him
[3:15:16] Catchinthesehands: the character is fine people are just bad with it
[3:15:23] stradiater: qtpie seems to be doing good on it, but in my games the people cant play it
[3:15:23] kit_cakez: the dmg is just not there early
[3:15:52] Catchinthesehands: its a scaling champ
[3:15:54] fatguy925: Is smoulder viable yet?
[3:15:58] Catchinthesehands: its not supposd 2 do dmg earlier
[3:16:22] kit_cakez: well instalosing lane is not great lol @Catchinthesehands
[3:16:55] fatguy925: Hes like super old tristana or vayne right, where they lose lane win game?
[3:17:18] Maqqee: lose lane lose game champ
[3:17:34] kidlink70: the scaling isnt there like the other champs you listed
[3:18:07] Catchinthesehands: @kit_cakez sadly it be like that witha new champ
[3:18:31] kit_cakez: yeah but it's not a skill thing, it's just the champ being sub-par
[3:18:56] Catchinthesehands: @kit_cakez probably but we will see with time
[3:19:09] kit_cakez: well ofc he'll be better after they buff him xdd
[3:20:50] LeiteroMasta: might as well target ban smolder from now on LUL
[3:21:13] Catchinthesehands: @kit_cakez i wonder if they will tbh
[3:21:45] kit_cakez: they will, no shot they don't buff a 46% wr champ that's not giga skill intensive
[3:24:23] BestAlphey: you got Smoldered
[3:25:26] LeiteroMasta: tragic rumble ult
[3:26:57] i_beebo: Instant surrender
[3:28:32] kit_cakez: not a fan of the ER on smolder, feel TF is better
[3:28:56] kidlink70: your taking the coin flip versus the ban
[3:29:22] kit_cakez: smolder dmg
[3:29:30] lebrongabes: this is why u ban smolder
[3:29:41] kidlink70: sub 150 total dmg
[3:29:44] kit_cakez: dude hit her with everything and she ended up with more hp than she had before KEKW
[3:29:50] lebrongabes: ive palyed him
[3:29:52] lebrongabes: hes not fun
[3:29:53] Sheshantol: 1-9 smolder on my team Aware
[3:29:55] CheckYorSix: why not play him as support instead of them?
[3:29:55] bradnickley: new n shiny
[3:29:55] LordAudacity: i dont either
[3:29:55] kit_cakez: if you wanna smolder just play Ezreal
[3:30:08] LeiteroMasta: is smolder the weakest champ on release in recent memory?
[3:30:13] lebrongabes: his main ability is annoying to use cause the range is so low
[3:30:15] CheckYorSix: haven't played yet on this patch
[3:30:27] kit_cakez: bro is ezreal but squishy and teemo range KEKW
[3:30:34] CheckYorSix: but calling him a bad ezreal means he is at the bottom of the garbage pile
[3:30:46] Sheshantol: I bet smolder is the only champ to have 45% or less win rate on release in the last 2 years
[3:30:46] BestAlphey: unsmoldered!
[3:31:07] TCBloo: Is this some kind of TFT clone?
[3:31:24] lebrongabes: this is what happens on the board when ur going 8th
