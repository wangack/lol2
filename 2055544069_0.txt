[0:07:58] lazink: Do you think Riot should try to sell the media rights to the new ESPN/Warner et al. Streaming service that was announced?
[0:08:08] NextLevelChunk: yes monte!
[0:08:22] rogaine_saintvicious2: intermittent fasting for me but not by choice LUL
[0:08:49] lazink: is that the problem, no one wants the media rights?

[0:11:04] piez0rz: riot wont sell teams skins like owl right?
[0:11:12] Tsuchimiya: Tsuchimiya subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Thanks for all the content monte, really saving me on my commute to work these days!
[0:11:20] lazink: makes sense, thanks for answering!
[0:11:51] TheBasedTaka: league would be so nice with lots of tournaments
[0:11:52] sadsal12: you really save me during work :D
[0:12:00] silentmilkTTV: you could also say that LCS teams need to find a way to perform better on the world stage. I bet T1 makes more money in the US than Immortals
[0:12:01] rogaine_saintvicious2: is weed legal in korea?
[0:12:07] AndrasMan01: we kind of have the formula, with how ogn made it, but I guess riot has to run around in circles for years until they arrive at that conclusion
[0:12:36] VehementPhoenix: Between all 4 major regions having actually enjoyable games, and IEM Kato right now, I'm having a hell of a time keeping up with esports
[0:12:54] KoKonN: @AndrasMan01 after they arrive at the conclusion, they will claim they invented it as well
[0:14:00] AndrasMan01: @KoKonN  and how magnanimous of them to share that "new" knowledge with us
[0:14:09] KoKonN: also, faker must have done insane mental damage to scout,  he was like top3 players in the world last year, and now just plays like an absolute beginner bot
[0:14:12] lazink: @AndrasMan01 I'd really like Riot to just give the leagues to the owners, and take a "IP" % of the revenue that the league makes in ads ect.. but don't think riot would ever give up control like that
[0:14:12] Zizonyx: eavE

[0:16:04] VehementPhoenix: In what universe is jg counterpick more important than top counterpick
[0:16:33] KoKonN: @lazink cant wait for scripters to find a way around vanguard anyway
[0:16:44] VehementPhoenix: Oh i missed the rumble my bad
[0:17:03] rogaine_saintvicious2: coach arthur?
[0:17:18] weezo007: Who's stronger 2023 jdg or blg 2024?
[0:17:38] VehementPhoenix: So far, 2023 jdg and its not particularly close
[0:17:40] KoKonN: @weezo007 mechanically probably BLG, team cohesion wise we will see
[0:18:07] a_lonely_observer: We finally got to lng jdg LUL can't wait for game 2
[0:18:31] VehementPhoenix: Because of worlds, people forgt JDG looked like the greatest team of all time for like 6 months
[0:18:51] KoKonN: @VehementPhoenix for like 99% of the year
[0:18:57] VehementPhoenix: Yep
[0:19:11] profound23: We've seen that line of play with the TK a few times across different regions in pro play
[0:19:21] a_lonely_observer: I think jdg kinda got scammed by the lng t1 series and they gave up on playing what they were good at playing
[0:19:50] Im_Rubic: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[0:20:01] TheBasedTaka: they love each other
[0:20:11] KoKonN: how mark keeps getting on top tier rosters is a big enigma
[0:20:13] a_lonely_observer: Gala was ass this series tbh can't blame it all on mark
[0:21:02] butelka_z_odzysku: is it possible that match vs T1 make negative impect in scout and gala performance or is it just bad form without conection to worlds? @MonteCristo

[0:22:31] dustmoonz: that sounds fcking good
[0:22:33] kingruben7: why your food always so complicated
[0:22:38] a_lonely_observer: The narrative in China atm is that the removal of mythics hurt gala as now adcs are more lane reliant and can't just play like a dog in lane until 1 item mythic spike
[0:22:43] Komarimasita: sadly I'm still at work but watching on mobile haha
[0:22:47] dustmoonz: @kingruben7 because it"s good
[0:22:49] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: it just sounds like a good wrap
[0:22:51] lazink: it's not that complicated
[0:22:58] NAAlistar: Latin + Asian fusion is so good
[0:22:58] ogoaxe: Is it true that on average korean food is very spicy or is it specific dishes?
[0:22:59] dooril_: Do you put ssamjang as well?
[0:23:06] potus_barnacle: I'll take 12 of those to go please

[0:24:19] BinglyTinson: theyre very happy alright
[0:24:22] KoKonN: all of lng looks so off for some reason
[0:24:29] rfarleydude97: @MonteCristo with the recent Yamato news and after some proper time, where do you think he goes in terms of a coaching job? C9 perhaps? or if not, where?
[0:24:42] KoKonN: @rfarleydude97 back to the sack
[0:24:48] saberaxe: @MonteCristo Did you read Dom's tweet about Scout?
[0:24:51] BinglyTinson: mark kills the lng vibes
[0:24:55] Im_Rubic: wait LNG win this game
[0:24:58] rfarleydude97: @KoKonN  hell yeah, that was fun content to watch
[0:25:03] dannyridsdale01: what kind of chips
[0:25:03] saberaxe: Scout is still under the effects of Faker's mind control
[0:25:05] butelka_z_odzysku: if xin have 20 farm less than rell in 7 minute you know its over
[0:25:09] najafan: League > Wife, duh
[0:25:12] basedsoojung: Monte would you consider doing coaching again
[0:25:25] a_lonely_observer: @wiisoka there's a big meme going on atm where people are saying bsyy (current lng coach previous tes coach) and mark are drafting and playing as if gala is jackeylove and don't know what's wrong
[0:25:35] KoKonN: tbh rell's early clear is the fastest in the game
[0:25:55] rfarleydude97: Scout getting shit on by Yagao wtf
[0:25:55] saberaxe: Agent Scout never deactivated after worlds

[0:26:16] VehementPhoenix: LPL BANGER
[0:26:21] Im_Rubic: Mind control the enemy to think you are bad, so they let their guard down 5Head
[0:26:23] BinglyTinson: everyones already checked out for lunar new year
[0:26:23] VehementPhoenix: IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE
[0:26:23] pleasure_faucet: i heard a rumor that this offfseason jojo and inspired were wanting to play in eu, can you confirm/deny this?
[0:26:24] burdil3z: if monte says I believe that
[0:26:29] wiisoka: @a_lonely_observer i surf hupu from time to time, but I use Google translate, which is not very accurate. Did you learn on your own ?
[0:26:38] hotblew1337: LPL is controlled by chinese esports betting industry to make running a team profitable >_>
[0:26:44] fernysilva19: Aware lng
[0:26:47] OvtForeverFall: just think of how LNG got smashed by T1
[0:26:47] awoogawooogawoo: what is timer for execute?
[0:26:58] KoKonN: inspired wanted to play in EU
[0:27:00] KoKonN: thats true
[0:27:06] KoKonN: he talked abt it on stream in december
[0:27:06] unrequitedIove: Spica says he rather lay in EU than NA
[0:27:07] najafan: US Green Card is OP
[0:27:10] KoKonN: it was in polish tho
[0:27:11] StuntmanStan: if you have a green card is it ever worth it to go back
[0:27:12] unrequitedIove: play*
[0:27:21] najafan: The US stock market is now 48% of the world economy.
[0:27:46] a_lonely_observer: @wiisoka my family moved to Canada when I was 9 so I'm still fluent because I went to school back in China
[0:27:56] burdil3z: @StuntmanStan impact is a genius do you say?
[0:28:02] pleasure_faucet: would salaries in na still be more then eu? you'd think for competitive reasons they both want to be in eu
[0:28:07] boomersh0t: did kobbe get green card?
[0:28:24] KoKonN: being from Poland makes it easier to get a green card + i think someone from inspired's has a green card as well
[0:28:28] boomersh0t: nm he wasnt in NA long at all
[0:28:33] pleasure_faucet: i dont get whts so special about c9, no hate just not sure what you get out of na
[0:28:52] najafan: Also it's basically impossible to immigrate to the US if you wanted to do it later in life.
[0:29:06] najafan: So the H1B + green card is the way to go.
[0:29:33] dustmoonz: top 8 lck vs top 8 lpl plays a LEC style split together right now, who wins the split
[0:29:33] Im_Rubic: solid
[0:29:42] lazink: @pleasure_faucet if your not offered by g2 or fnatic, you have a better chance of going to worlds/MSI on C9, then with an LEC team
[0:29:45] a_lonely_observer: @pleasure_faucet the season 3/4 C9 with balls hai lemon sneaky etc was really creative and fun to watch, the current iteration of C9 just looks like tsm
[0:29:46] IEatLamas: jhin ult?
[0:29:58] icebergen: Yo Monte, are the cooking streams coming back this year?
[0:30:04] rfarleydude97: @lazink true
[0:30:05] KHitt: Evening Monte...I could DM, but I have always wodnered why havent you written a "tell-all" yet?
[0:30:11] unrequitedIove: @dustmoonz top 8 lck is basically the whole league
[0:30:19] hotblew1337: What patch was this on? @MonteCristo
[0:30:24] dustmoonz: @unrequitedIove true lol
[0:30:29] VehementPhoenix: Rookern has arrived. Rip flandre
[0:30:32] profound23: Rulers bowl haircut is the cleanest of them all
[0:30:45] KoKonN: this rookern item needs to be nuked hard, its so fkn op
[0:30:57] hotblew1337: I thought this patch was 14.1 but no double support item

[0:31:36] hotblew1337: If its 14.1 its totally griefing to not go support item on kench LOL
[0:32:01] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo DADDY MONTE, I QUIT MY RANKED GAME TO WATCH YOU~!!!!
[0:32:07] VehementPhoenix: Yea its pretty terrible to not buy it
[0:32:11] nautcholibre: Do you think NA playing on live patch helps or hinders them ?
[0:32:23] hotblew1337: hes MISSING about 2500 gold between upgraded support item and giving senna creep money with item
[0:32:37] a_lonely_observer: Yeah rookern into frozen heart is giving off Sunfire spirit visage meta vibes
[0:32:53] awoogawooogawoo: what is with ruler and shurima shuffle

[0:34:06] butelka_z_odzysku: how many LPL teams would be in your top 5 best teams in the world rn? @MonteCristo
[0:35:12] hotblew1337: undoubtedly BLG JDG toss up
[0:35:20] VehementPhoenix: Riot just actively hates ergonomics man. WTF is the item "Hubris" or "Malignance"? Why can't items be real corporeal fantasy objects, so that our human brains can wrap themselves around what they do in the abstraction of the game. Same with Rookern. Wtf is a rookern.
[0:35:28] AndrasMan01: no TT i n top 5? disaapointed
[0:35:35] a_lonely_observer: It just depends on if you think tes is better than hle
[0:35:47] ogoaxe: Do you think that a LPL team would've won worlds by now if there wasn't a mass Korean exodus to China after the breakup of sister teams?
[0:35:59] MissingMatter: Maybe it's just a typo and it's "rook urn" and it's a vase full of crows.
[0:36:05] f3lchmaster9000: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Trying to decide where to go snowboarding tomorrow in Tahoe. Should I go to SugarBowl or Sierra-at-Tahoe? This has been my hardest decision so far this year

[0:38:17] f3lchmaster9000: @Glyers lul
[0:38:20] rogaine_saintvicious2: i prefer blackhawk for powder
[0:38:28] DixMX: crazy to think that Flandre was world champion
[0:38:30] falconforcex: nederland my favorite
[0:38:32] hotblew1337: @Glyers enemy bot lane be eating elk meat vs blg

[0:39:04] burdil3z: how many Koreans can fill a lpl team? 2(?)
[0:39:05] awoogawooogawoo: flandre was solid 2021
[0:39:34] f3lchmaster9000: LNG were sand bagging
[0:39:55] VehementPhoenix: Flandre is EU Revenge
[0:40:04] hotblew1337: Okay @MonteCristo missing picked up support item now
[0:40:10] stevethekind: gala flame horizon on ruler. classic gala
[0:40:14] VehementPhoenix: LPL Revenge I mean
[0:40:24] commando1814: @butelka_z_odzysku most likely it's - 1 week after the patch hits pro ( at Lea at prior years ) so I guess effectively next week then if I do the math right ?
[0:40:38] a_lonely_observer: Flandre is lpl Doran
[0:40:45] commando1814: unless lpl does new champ's different than lcs
[0:40:48] VehementPhoenix: Nah Doran wins
[0:40:57] MoldyCalzone: KEKW
[0:41:04] Shobes572: @montecristo was meal prepping so i missed the start, is LPL on 14.2 yet?
[0:41:06] f3lchmaster9000: Scoop there it is
[0:41:08] butelka_z_odzysku: @commando1814 thanks, hopefully you are right

[0:41:51] butelka_z_odzysku: never trust cd in replay
[0:41:56] commando1814: @butelka_z_odzysku is smolder a really fun champ ?
[0:42:08] stevethekind: ive never seen the jump scare azir
[0:42:32] DixMX: indie company, leave them alone Kappa
[0:42:33] dannyridsdale01: the gnomes who change the picture are underpaid
[0:42:39] SPQR_Brutus: How on earth do you review tape/analysis without proper cd in vods? Mind boggling
[0:42:42] a_lonely_observer: Rit probably fired the coders dealing with bugs
[0:42:45] hotblew1337: 14.2 also has elder dragon timer at 6 min instead of 5min
[0:43:15] ctrain46: that was sick

[0:46:00] hotblew1337: Putting ruler on senna feels like a handicap for the team with the best AD player in the world
[0:46:07] IEatLamas: Senna with one and a half item

[0:46:53] butelka_z_odzysku: but its rather jdg playing bad than lng good
[0:47:08] VehementPhoenix: Ornn now has the pair of completely unbalanced, inexcusable, tank items. Nice

[0:50:58] DixMX: are all LPL games played on the same studio, or do they keep moving around the country?
[0:51:10] burdil3z: they know her fault was let LNG make a full engage team with no response to that
[0:51:13] Bladetykon: @MonteCristo how can youtube be our least favourite child if discord did not even get a ping or message at all
[0:51:18] VehementPhoenix: It's Bangers Only, Monte only interacts with banger comments
[0:51:23] crazyswayZ: its like howls moving lpl studio... same studio but it moves
[0:51:24] Storm1854: just have to say Four Play is one of the best things out there these days, watched em all

[0:51:55] hotblew1337: @MonteCristo do u have any insight into why LNG isnt playing Hang over mark? It feels like they were so much better last year with hang in the bot lane
[0:52:59] axeman_ow: i think the rumor is that gala prefers playing with mark since they played together before?
[0:52:59] defilerz: who is hungover mike?

[0:54:21] ctrain46: sick you covered Fall of the house of Usher
[0:54:22] Shobes572: @montecristo if you have an idea for a web app that would help with the multi streaming I could help with developing it
[0:54:36] rhjf: more of a satoshi nakamoto guy myself
[0:54:49] DixMX: what about casting TFT? Kappa
[0:54:58] Mykah9: If someone was to buy The TSM brand would you consider coaching?
[0:55:00] Storm1854: my tastes and views are way closer to @MonteCristo than Richard or Thorin but they always bring the a very cool insight
[0:55:10] Storm1854: in regards to Four Play
[0:55:15] hotblew1337: @MonteCristo I think it might be a meta decision because hang was much better on engage supports like alistar rell leona rakan vs enchanters. Thats just my personal thoughts tho and not any evidence other than hang played end of last year in that meta
[0:55:16] SetaGamingTV: @MonteCristo i have to tell you Monte the best times at league was when you were casting worlds in like season 2, 3 etc .
[0:55:17] ctrain46: lmao

[0:56:47] BinglyTinson: fuck actually being team side. i could see monte doing one off consulting for the right offer though
[0:57:16] Bladetykon: @MonteCristo to honor the dnd themes in the intro of nerd legion will you guys play a dnd one shot where you have to defeat the evil tyrant I mean riot
[0:57:22] Darkraging: So you are saying depending on the work ethic of 5 children as a career path isnt enticing you?
[0:57:33] butelka_z_odzysku: yamato sad
[0:57:50] Storm1854: yeah that power dynamic is wack
[0:58:05] ogoaxe: What if it was a korean team with the full structure?
[0:58:06] SetaGamingTV: its not a matter of age only, its a culture aspect. im pretty sure shit like that doesnt happen with Korean coatches
[0:58:13] DixMX: you mean coaching Doublelift wasn't fulfilling?

[0:58:33] Shobes572: I have not resonated with something you said so much before
[0:58:36] BinglyTinson: they need to take a note from the urban meyer playbook like the chinese coaches do

[0:58:58] xMisterGrey: are u playing the game at all or were u ever actively playing?
[0:58:58] Storm1854: wonder how it would change if they added two time outs per team
[0:58:59] innaething: I think Lucian millio into nautilus varus isn’t necessarily pressure for the Lucian millio side
[0:59:05] innaething: it really depends on
[0:59:06] Fissiccisst: Do you think the game would be better or worse if a coach could be in comms during a game?
[0:59:11] butelka_z_odzysku: so why yamato decided to coach instead of content creation another year?

[0:59:55] BinglyTinson: not only would it be op, itd be so jarring as a viewer if timeouts were a thing
[1:00:02] SetaGamingTV: its not a matter of age only, its a culture aspect. im pretty sure shit like that doesnt happen with Korean coatches
[1:00:10] burdil3z: @Shobes572 lov u bro
[1:00:18] Guardianx4x: I work in Fort Collins, I will help you move my man I got you haha
[1:00:30] Storm1854: I do have to say that in the past few years in league being able to have more than like 10-15 stagnant picks in pro play compared to a few years ago is one good thing to come

[1:19:21] 3times1minus1: I'll make some calls
[1:19:23] Storm1854: its like a dream come true
[1:19:28] 국거박: I want to produce a show where Monte talks to T1 fans in mass.
[1:19:30] Guardianx4x: Monte favorite player to ever play and why?
[1:19:35] TheBasedTaka: shark tank has spoken
[1:19:56] kerokerogrips: monte are your global power rankings ,a team by team basis do you also tier each major region?
[1:20:08] SPQR_Brutus: ok
[1:20:10] Big_Dew: @MonteCristo didn't they already make this show? Love on the spectrum?
[1:20:20] Mykah9: I think I can get two investors from the Sacramento Kings to cash out on this
[1:20:25] najafan: Call it Truck Love.
[1:20:28] butelka_z_odzysku: let them 2v1 you
[1:20:32] Corgax: isn't everyone kindof a lowkey T1 fan?
[1:20:33] 국거박: @najafan xDD
[1:20:35] Mykah9: I will interview with you as a T1 fan and show my face
[1:20:37] DixMX: BASED
[1:20:37] Mykah9: give me a date
[1:20:45] JeeFour: @MonteCristo score the king but not Dandy?

[1:20:58] TakinR: Peanut in convo for GOAT jungler?
[1:20:59] clippityycloppityy: score is your junglelove
[1:21:02] ogoaxe: @JeeFour I guess Dandy didn't have the longevity
[1:21:02] burdil3z: og*
[1:21:16] SetaGamingTV: score? nah what was SKts jungler this year? the gtuy was sick carry
[1:21:17] Midnightsgrin: @MonteCristo are the western t1 fans the issue, or all T1 fans?
[1:21:20] 국거박: You know what I really want to see? I want to see west talks to east.
[1:21:22] Professional_Aellith: I’m a T1 fan, only because I used to be a TSM fan in the Dyrus/OddOne era and don’t know any other teams.
[1:21:32] 국거박: Get western analysts talk to Korean or eastern analysts.
[1:21:48] Corgax: if eu and na combined their best 5 players do they stand a shot this year?
[1:21:58] Mykah9: Feelsbadman I got rejected by Monte
[1:22:09] JanYLbert: Do you think physical trading cards for pro players will increase the stocks of riot?
[1:22:09] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:22:27] burdil3z: cloudtemplar was a great guy?
[1:22:32] a_lonely_observer: Wasn't he the guy who got trucked off the broadcast because he called faker by his champion name and not by "faker"?
[1:22:45] Mykah9: is this because i live in the LJL?
[1:22:49] 국거박: Kim Dong Jun is casting in CL, LPL Korea, and LEC sometimes.
[1:23:00] clippityycloppityy: do you have a montecristo esque revenge plot against riot?
[1:23:05] DixMX: YaGOAT
[1:23:21] butelka_z_odzysku: if it was knight you'd say hes good not lucky @MonteCristo
[1:23:49] TheBasedTaka: do you think na is closing the gap or are they all as bad as each other now
[1:23:54] Bloodbow99: It's crazy that Yagao is the father of all the mids in lpl.
[1:23:54] dooril_: is Scout pulling a 322? LUL
[1:24:08] Professional_Aellith: What are you favorite regions to watch even if they’re not the best performing?
[1:24:11] JeeFour: is it just me or was the golden age of league esports from season 2-5ish? or was it just me?
[1:24:15] Zeroantagonist: it feels to me more like EU has been falling off tbh
[1:24:19] Clyde1500: did lcs close the gap or did lec jump back into it?
[1:24:27] DankWizard420: @JeeFour 4-7 would be more widely accepted
[1:24:30] ogoaxe: They are closing the gap to the abyss
[1:24:33] infinite_zed: I love yagao and his play style
[1:24:38] Zeroantagonist: old school fnatic and then world contenders G2 until now
[1:25:03] noitomx: BDS been pretty solid with their new adc named ice
[1:25:06] crazyswayZ: i think "the gap" just shrunk a bit from the very early days and then stayed relatively constant over the past years
[1:25:16] 국거박: What do you think contributes to Azir's high win rate in LPL compared to LCK?
[1:25:20] crazyswayZ: meaning east > west
[1:25:23] PurificationAW: @MonteCristo What do u think about jax jungle in comp? And rumble top ?
[1:25:34] a_lonely_observer: S8 and 9 were hype and kinda revitalized the west because people thought g2 and fnc had a chance. If g2 had won season 9 we might not even have a ESports winter in the west
[1:25:34] najafan: Can anyone tell me why I sometimes just randomly get hololive videos recommended for me on YT? I never ever watch vtubers. Ever.
[1:25:38] JeeFour: @DankWizard420 it was probably just me then. those times just felt more competitive and intense. It felt like the "good teams" were REALLY good.
[1:25:39] najafan: It makes no sense to me.
[1:25:45] brandofan2: i miss the show you used to do on OGN where you talked about all the big plays/teams in other regions, mostly because of the Monteclap memes
[1:25:51] AdmiralReggie: gg
[1:25:57] Zeroantagonist: @crazyswayZ i would agree mostly but my own region (now PCS) seems to have fallen off super hard below NA sadly
[1:26:09] DixMX: @najafan don't question, just enjoy it
[1:26:21] DixMX: AYAYA
[1:26:25] Professional_Aellith: Vtubers infest everything, they’re like bedbugs
[1:26:28] hotblew1337: That udyr ban inst4ead of varus was so troll tbh
[1:26:31] DankWizard420: @JeeFour even if s3 I remember fondly (first season and whitez ori max W Pog )
[1:26:41] crazyswayZ: super early days eastern teams were so op that riot nerfed wards... TWICE
[1:26:42] Yuiieeee: @Hmisay Aware
[1:27:00] najafan: @DixMX I have no interest in it!
[1:27:29] stephcurrysim: i haven't watched league in 6 years, hows my favourite player and GOAT of the west perkz been doing lately? does he still play

[1:28:33] DixMX: @MonteCristo do you think Poppy is cute?
[1:28:39] ctrain46: @JeeFour overall serotonin is down MiniK

[1:31:05] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips :MY REGION
[1:31:12] Nymaera_: LNG stall out well but they just lose their mind early
[1:31:16] wale_lol: I think this game is just too easy to make miistakes, its hard to have brain on all the time
[1:31:18] kerokerogrips: mods can we get the america 7tv emote ?
[1:31:20] Nymaera_: go watch game 1 v BLG
[1:31:28] Nymaera_: they throw with a scaling comp by fighting early too
[1:31:33] a_lonely_observer: Gala played this game as if he didn't exist
[1:31:33] Nymaera_: so weird earlygame plans
[1:31:50] garry_leonard: LNL hasn't been doing enough ARAM
[1:31:58] LilGimli: @Nymaera_ thanks again for the co-streams <3
[1:32:02] Nymaera_: oh by the way try and count the autos Gala does in this game to champions
[1:32:04] Ethabixx: @MonteCristo do you bet on games?

[1:33:17] wale_lol: korea winning msi confirmed
[1:33:18] Nymaera_: cheers, official broadcast is back today luckily, it’s been a busy week
[1:33:24] 3times1minus1: He's a dirty boy
[1:33:26] najafan: @OvtForeverFall Correct, it's even worse than it looks, they've limited shorts.
[1:33:28] Nymaera_: Sam and I are gonna do as much coverage as we can tho
[1:33:30] Zeroantagonist: there are 2 LPL games today right
[1:33:32] Zeroantagonist: in a few hours
[1:33:36] 3times1minus1: Mamma said "wash up"
[1:33:52] esr_140: @Nymaera_ Wednesday Broadcast Pog
[1:34:00] dannyridsdale01: is that a duke 3d reference
[1:34:03] Shobes572: Mild mid game trolling
[1:34:04] Nymaera_: yes legit
[1:34:10] Knait0: only against strong teams
[1:34:22] Zeroantagonist: too hard to watch all regions while balancing irl job and other hobbies, but will watch LPL today in absence of other games
[1:34:22] Nymaera_: LNG win by getting scout sidelane gold at 15-20 minutes
[1:34:29] DankWizard420: 50/50, my type of team EZ
[1:34:29] Nymaera_: that’s their good point
[1:34:35] Nymaera_: everything else is really questionable
[1:35:07] Nymaera_: GENG didn’t throw early last year as much haha
[1:35:28] 3times1minus1: OH HAI MARK
[1:36:18] DankWizard420: BigBrother
[1:36:19] Nymaera_: triple volley and Ashe slows are so obnoxious man
[1:36:37] hotblew1337: Gala 2 autos in that fight btw @MonteCristo i counted for u
[1:36:58] MoonFall24: typical case of pyke champ perhaps?
[1:37:03] Knait0: I guess they didn't wanted to fight because jdg had spells
[1:37:17] UpYerArs: lmao such a greedy pathing
[1:37:20] Nymaera_: don’t question the YaGOAT
[1:37:21] Jeffp2662: he isnt gonna be anywhere else!?
[1:37:22] AType: How is this iteration of JDG compared to last year?

[1:37:45] fruge2: bc their mid laner is yagao instead of knight
[1:37:50] fruge2: that's why it makes me angry
[1:37:58] albinobunneh: yagao instead of knight must be quite the change lol
[1:38:01] 3times1minus1: Baba Yagao
[1:38:06] Jeffp2662: and taliyah can check that brush with like all 3 spells
[1:38:10] Nymaera_: I was dying inside casting this ngl
[1:38:17] hotblew1337: This year it sucks cuz JDG no matter how good they are this year will not be able to live up to the GOATed team they were last year
[1:38:25] Komarimasita: man i was so excited for this matchup this is kind of disappointing
[1:38:30] fruge2: @albinobunneh like going from shopping at whole foods to walmart
[1:38:31] 3times1minus1: I'm already dead
[1:38:47] fcloud: turns out the bangers in "bangers only" is monte banging his head on the table in frustration

[1:39:15] Shobes572: Pyke should have hooked xin on that bot play
[1:39:17] fruge2: yagao

[1:39:20] Jeffp2662: yagao trying for 20 death powerspike
[1:39:21] KoKonN: pyke champ useless past 20 mins
[1:39:26] Nymaera_: that’s a good indicator lmao
[1:39:28] Komarimasita: bless
[1:39:32] HiivaLoL: COMP DIFF
[1:39:37] HiivaLoL: TALIYAH OP
[1:39:49] HiivaLoL: taliyah vs 5 melees
[1:39:53] Nymaera_: oh hey Hiiva what’s up
[1:40:07] Nymaera_: ah yeah Taliyah’s underrated as a Draven counter
[1:40:09] HiivaLoL: + ashe varus mega strong lane and not really behind from early
[1:40:13] HiivaLoL: pyke falls off
[1:40:14] Nymaera_: as soon as E’s down Draven can’t play
[1:40:20] HiivaLoL: xin vs melees
[1:40:26] HiivaLoL: very strong
[1:40:32] MrHandsomeNoodle: yagao is dark sorcerer of lpl dude just wins somehow and doesnt even look that good doing it half the time it doesnt make sense
[1:40:37] HiivaLoL: aatrox vs 4 short range champs
[1:40:50] garry_leonard: They aren't really snow balling the lead to much, interesting that kill on mid didn't lead to dragon control
[1:40:52] HiivaLoL: azir has to do some heavy lifting in this game
[1:41:12] HiivaLoL: but has the resources from early gmae
[1:41:18] HiivaLoL: being 1/0/2 etc
[1:41:20] 3times1minus1: @MonteCristo Would you do a show full of pro fails called Bongers only?
[1:41:29] Nymaera_: scout’s got like 110 Azir games and his next most played is 60
[1:41:37] Ethabixx: @MonteCristo opinion on tarzan as a player?
[1:41:56] HiivaLoL: I am bench warmer
[1:42:04] kerokerogrips: what was the delusional comment you or thorin got?  something about the eye test not being real ?
[1:42:09] HiivaLoL: I was

[1:42:51] MrHandsomeNoodle: @kerokerogrips to be fair, if the eye test isnt real, yagao might just be the best example of why it isnt Kappa

[1:43:11] najafan: Taliyah OP - QED
[1:43:13] Gunloth: posture check
[1:43:21] HiivaLoL: :)

[1:43:23] dusT: Can I ask a rather peculiar question
[1:43:34] garry_leonard: all of LNG's lead slowly lost to poor control over the map.
[1:43:43] HiivaLoL: I prefer to talk about the game
[1:43:56] MrHandsomeNoodle: @dusT no, monte does not drink 3 glasses of milk a day
[1:43:57] 3times1minus1: I should actually get to bed, the sandman's starting to goose me.
[1:44:05] DrifterX21: @dust congrats on your win brotha! rlewisSamSound

[1:44:30] HiivaLoL: Ashe sup + taliyah
[1:44:46] HiivaLoL: every laners nightmare
[1:44:54] MrHandsomeNoodle: @MonteCristo do you feel like weiwei is an upgrade over tarzan? or even a side grade?
[1:45:04] eatluxury: language barrier PepeLaugh
[1:45:12] garry_leonard: Not only that but htey also burn mid's TP on top so they lose any TP preasure.
[1:45:23] KoKonN: @MrHandsomeNoodle depends if u mean regular season tarzan or worlds tarzan
[1:45:32] HiivaLoL: all memes aside blue comp is a full meat grinder while red is the so called sausage
[1:46:03] HiivaLoL: the fights are so hard to play
[1:46:04] kerokerogrips: @kerokerogrips agreed , some players have some intangibles , but i dont think a whole team of players like that will pass an eye test cuz at some point you have to demonstrate that you have better hands than your opponent
[1:46:11] HiivaLoL: and what can you do vs taliyah global pressure
[1:46:14] HiivaLoL: and ashe E maphack
[1:46:24] HiivaLoL: like Ashe E just gives you global vision
[1:46:28] HiivaLoL: so its so easy to play
[1:46:35] najafan: I mean, KSante is at least a particularly tough bit of bone.
[1:46:50] MrHandsomeNoodle: @kerokerogrips yeah, i mean at the end of the days intangibles can be a real thing but the best player in the world isnt ever going to be just intangibles lol
[1:46:53] OvtForeverFall: LNG just plays like a turtle
[1:46:58] hotblew1337: @najafan that just makes him easier to stack  liandries on later
[1:47:09] Nymaera_: really need to bait JDG into an overengage and punish
[1:47:15] Nymaera_: so hard to play out this game now
[1:47:28] butelka_z_odzysku: is tarzan benched or our o contract?
[1:47:33] HiivaLoL: But the thing is JDG never needs to commit
[1:47:37] hotblew1337: ^didnt resign
[1:47:38] HiivaLoL: they can just play with spells
[1:47:40] HiivaLoL: from range

[1:47:47] HiivaLoL: combo cc into one shots
[1:47:58] HiivaLoL: varus R hits? aight ur dead
[1:48:02] Nymaera_: yeah it’s super hard to play out
[1:48:06] HiivaLoL: ashe r hits byebye
[1:48:11] HiivaLoL: ok we didnt hit anythign?
[1:48:12] HiivaLoL: we kite back
[1:48:15] hotblew1337: Gala 2nd cleanse on almost nothing?
[1:48:19] najafan: Xin hits?
[1:48:21] najafan: Uh oh
[1:48:22] Nymaera_: pyke isn’t a champion either now
[1:48:23] HiivaLoL: u wanna run into taliyah and the fam
[1:48:26] HiivaLoL: we happy with that
[1:48:54] Fissiccisst: Makes me wonder why Thresh isn't picked more
[1:48:58] Fissiccisst: I guess the hook is too slow
[1:49:00] Nymaera_: might be able to look for sneaky ward TP flanks
[1:49:09] HiivaLoL: thresh laning phase is too weak @Fissiccisst
[1:49:11] smithpw: fishing the best part of every game
[1:49:13] najafan: Real talk, we should bring Taliyah jg back
[1:49:22] Nymaera_: thresh also self CCs himself with Q
[1:49:23] MrHandsomeNoodle: hook is slow, have to stand still while doing it, range isnt THAT long
[1:49:28] Jeffp2662: skill shot long range stuns.  gets lots of free flashes on short cds
[1:49:31] DankWizard420: fishing? wish fizz was ..better played a game yday and felt so weak Sadge
[1:49:33] HiivaLoL: taliyah jg is good
[1:49:38] Nymaera_: it’s ok if you can trade hook for hook and win
[1:50:10] hotblew1337: I main taliyah jg + trundle jg in Masters and she feels little weaker with item changes but still really strong
[1:50:25] hotblew1337: especially versus so many daash heavy characters in the meta rn
[1:50:35] Nymaera_: why does he walk up man
[1:50:39] Nymaera_: so greedy
[1:51:00] Fissiccisst: Ok, does anyone remember old thresh, I have it in my head you used to be able to start hook then flash when it went out. Am I insane or did that used to be a thing?
[1:51:07] MrHandsomeNoodle: dont feel bad scout, i would also walk up there Kappa
[1:51:19] DankWizard420: other team missing for a solid 30seconds PepeLaugh
[1:51:20] HiivaLoL: I mean I get the idea of Draven Pyke vs squishies on botlane
[1:51:32] HiivaLoL: sadly the fact is that Ashe Varus just out all inns you
[1:51:32] Professional_Aellith: Rell just needs to be retired. She feels like a worse Sejuani in every aspect unless she’s piloted by junglers who already top tier.
[1:51:42] DankWizard420: double range bot needs to go SadgeCry
[1:51:50] HiivaLoL: so what is there to do
[1:51:58] HiivaLoL: Rell lv 2 gank?
[1:52:04] MrHandsomeNoodle: bro that replay animation kind of a flashbang
[1:52:35] Nymaera_: when they lose the 3v3 bot game’s over
[1:52:39] HiivaLoL: It doesn't really change the matchup
[1:52:39] hotblew1337: @HiivaLoL Draven started w longsword d blade and rell was pathing bot but full cleared instead of trying to dive
[1:52:42] Nymaera_: should be able to force that hard
[1:52:50] Nymaera_: can’t win otherwise

[1:52:51] HiivaLoL: Ashe just makes fun of youy
[1:52:57] HiivaLoL: ashe 625 range
[1:53:00] HiivaLoL: varus 600
[1:53:03] HiivaLoL: Draven ...
[1:53:04] HiivaLoL: 550?
[1:53:08] HiivaLoL: lemme check
[1:53:17] HiivaLoL: yes 550
[1:53:22] HiivaLoL: Its just
[1:53:23] MrHandsomeNoodle: i am here for flandre resurgence
[1:53:23] hotblew1337: I feel like ashe with no heal level 1 varus level one vs triple stack wave and rell pyke draven in bot should have been easy to dive
[1:53:23] HiivaLoL: hard
[1:53:31] HiivaLoL: like
[1:53:32] HiivaLoL: really hard
[1:53:42] crazyswayZ: ashe is way too useful after stomping you in lane even... vision and "global" catch
[1:53:43] HiivaLoL: and ur vs two perfect clicking bots
[1:53:46] HiivaLoL: called ruler
[1:53:48] HiivaLoL: and missing
[1:53:53] FumaK0tar0: is it still true that many lpl teams start playing „serious“ after Chinese new year?
[1:54:03] HiivaLoL: although I dont think missing is ruler level
[1:54:07] HiivaLoL: ruler is another level
[1:54:12] Bloodbow99: @FumaK0tar0 yes
[1:54:18] DankWizard420: ashe shouldve been solved years ago but the ult does nothing when you play ad so it's a good support engage
[1:54:30] HiivaLoL: you land 1 aa as draven and you are 60% from enemy trading
[1:55:02] DankWizard420: I yearn for the day ap varus is played Sadge
[1:55:13] HiivaLoL: I will say that Yagao needs to study Scout vods about Taliyah R
[1:55:30] hotblew1337: ^ it gets better later this game
[1:55:33] najafan: @DankWizard420 AP Kog first, I pray
[1:55:43] juksu___: ruler and azir r name a cuter couple
[1:55:44] azzlo3: throw LUL
[1:55:46] DankWizard420: ap kog has been done, varus hasnt (I dont think)
[1:55:48] Mykah9: how are you telling me they lost this?
[1:55:52] LilGimli: and they lose KEKW
[1:55:58] HiivaLoL: guys
[1:55:58] MrHandsomeNoodle: ruler sitting there like when will riot banish this azir champ to the shadow realm??
[1:56:01] Mykah9: did they just turn their comp off after this?>
[1:56:02] HiivaLoL: twitch chat
[1:56:14] HiivaLoL: its Taliyah Xin Aatrox Varus vs full melee comp
[1:56:15] DankWizard420: @najafan got ptsd like 4months ago playing cho top into ap varus pepeAgony
[1:56:20] hotblew1337: Gala 3rd cleanse this game that effectively did nothing
[1:56:25] HiivaLoL: You just die
[1:56:25] najafan: @DankWizard420 I think it has? Like, once or twice as a mid.
[1:56:27] hotblew1337: @HiivaLoL ^^
[1:56:31] najafan: Just randomly.
[1:56:52] DankWizard420: maybe if/when lethality gets nerfed, doubt it'l appear tho FeelsBadMan
[1:57:00] najafan: But it would have been like S5-8 era.
[1:57:04] najafan: Ages ago.
[1:57:18] HiivaLoL: I don't mean to sound binary
[1:57:23] Jeffp2662: ruler had flash
[1:57:30] HiivaLoL: ofc red has playmaking with rell and azir
[1:57:31] eatluxury: ultra prime runs through these teams
[1:57:34] HiivaLoL: pyke random hook etc
[1:57:35] Slayra: 1 team region PepeLaugh
[1:57:38] crazyswayZ: i want to see eu go full zug zug at worlds... just flip the game at enemy raptors moscow5 style
[1:57:39] HiivaLoL: but its not easy to do
[1:57:40] kerokerogrips: LPL not looking as crazy as they looked last year sadge, roster shuffles and new map must be tripping then up
[1:58:16] lolznaga: lolznaga subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:58:31] Nymaera_: I mean we said that before MSI last year too and LPL always levels up after lunar new year break

[1:58:35] hotblew1337: BLG looking clean as fuck so far this year lowkey they the new LPL Terminators
[1:58:36] Nymaera_: so it’s not 100% doomed
[1:58:40] 1122121a: They said the same thing last year too
[1:59:15] Phaetox: Lpl is also not afraid to do post msi roster swaps either
[1:59:19] eatluxury: LPL being weaker means rookie has abetter chance of getting to worlds
[1:59:20] kerokerogrips: years not looking good for t1 haters (me included with them )
[1:59:21] LilGimli: but surely ksante/rell/azir should be able to make space for gala, its not like there's alot of hard engage on JDG
[1:59:26] Nymaera_: most of the time you play like 3~ times before the break now you play 5~ times this year so it looks worse
[1:59:34] Nymaera_: haven’t had the break to reassess yet
[1:59:48] Phaetox: So who knows where they end up b4 worlds
[2:00:00] crazyswayZ: make spac for gala to do what? run into vaurs/ashe?
[2:00:01] hotblew1337: @Nymaera_ ++ No preseason this year
[2:00:12] kerokerogrips: @Nymaera_ you need to do more podcasts , love your takes and analysis
[2:00:15] hotblew1337: I feel like no preseason this year really hurt the first few weeks of comp
[2:01:14] Nymaera_: @kerokerogrips did one today actually with Rich, should be out the next day or two
[2:01:27] Nymaera_: I’d do my own podcast I just don’t have time for it between everything else
[2:01:38] Nymaera_: I can show up on others’ shows just hard to run my own one
[2:01:40] kerokerogrips: @Nymaera_ HELL YEA , i look forward to it
[2:01:49] archie7497: Sup monte
[2:01:53] LilGimli: @crazyswayZ not like aatrox/xin can just run through LNG to draven either, and draven/ashe were put behind
[2:01:58] MrHandsomeNoodle: kanavi baited him its not his fault PepeHands
[2:02:03] Slayra: wawa
[2:02:11] DankWizard420: swear scout has had like 4 free ults this game vs flashes LUL
[2:02:26] Nymaera_: the hidden hard work is bloody organising and running a podcast, actually turning up and talking is the easy bit overall
[2:02:28] DankWizard420: that's an int monkaS
[2:02:54] kerokerogrips: @Nymaera_ you should ask monte for advice i hear hes pretty good at podcasts
[2:03:01] HiivaLoL: I do have to say Missing, yagao and somewhat Kanavi tend to think they are playing all in comps regardless of their champs
[2:03:20] HiivaLoL: Missing being imo the biggest criminal in this sense
[2:03:37] HiivaLoL: Usual every support is a nautilus type of play
[2:03:37] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:04:01] Nymaera_: that’s sort of a continuation of last year, JDG’s style was incredibly fast coordinated all-in’s when someone mispositions
[2:05:05] Nymaera_: almost clutch from Weiwei
[2:05:09] hotblew1337: Fighting Taliyah right here is so maniac wacky stuff LOL
[2:05:10] crazyswayZ: taliyah bopping them too
[2:05:11] najafan: @DankWizard420 btw, literally last year Berserker played it vs Dignitas. https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/LCS/2023_Season/Summer_Season/Scoreboards/Week_4
[2:05:16] Nymaera_: gets caught by a Aatrox Q mid combo
[2:05:47] HiivaLoL: I was about to write that in the position before it would be interesting argument for LNG just to start Baron
[2:05:50] Guardianx4x: I'm heading out Monte have a great night man, everyone smash that subscribe button, turn on notifications for future videos
[2:05:54] Guardianx4x: :P
[2:05:57] HiivaLoL: since their comp is kinda donezo otherwise
[2:06:03] HiivaLoL: but draven has no R
[2:06:09] JuCiEe19: i thought weiwei cooked at first
[2:06:10] HiivaLoL: I think Rell had no R as well?=
[2:06:14] HiivaLoL: like at 2430
[2:06:17] HiivaLoL: or smth like that
[2:06:24] HiivaLoL: Instead of holding bana
[2:06:24] DankWizard420: @najafan stattik abuse, classic PepeLaugh
[2:06:26] HiivaLoL: na
[2:06:47] HiivaLoL: so maybe just impossible
[2:06:58] hvammy: is missing gonna hit an arrow in this game?
[2:07:03] najafan: Zven also played it in 2018
[2:07:05] HiivaLoL: they had position
[2:07:30] HiivaLoL: its one of those things
[2:07:36] HiivaLoL: were your chances go down with time
[2:07:50] HiivaLoL: so when you have this position your chance is = X
[2:08:04] HiivaLoL: and it will be with time > X
[2:08:27] Tannrd: Pyke is just mega useless this game, no?
[2:08:38] HiivaLoL: but they tried to trap which is understandable (but will never work vs Ashe)

[2:09:07] 1122121a: finished BLG vs LNG
[2:09:10] 1122121a: ?
[2:09:11] MrHandsomeNoodle: do you guys think he actually loves delay or was it sarcasm?
[2:09:19] hotblew1337: @Nymaera_ Do you know what that pause was for? like a glitch w pyke r>
[2:09:37] Slayra: @MrHandsomeNoodle i think he was being genuine YEP
[2:09:44] MrHandsomeNoodle: @Slayra me too
[2:10:06] Nymaera_: you can get the gold from it without the kill, I misspoke
[2:10:12] Nymaera_: kill participation rather
[2:10:26] Nymaera_: if they die while your ult’s going through
[2:10:34] hotblew1337: I seeeee
[2:10:43] sensualturnips: sensualturnips subscribed with Prime. 
[2:11:04] Nymaera_: I don’t know what the issue was in that pause though we never got told
[2:11:19] Nymaera_: just speculated since the observer highlighted it
[2:11:20] Slayra: what a name YEP
[2:11:21] hotblew1337: thanks
[2:11:21] AzureCatalyst: yeeee sensual turnips!
[2:12:09] HiivaLoL: (land one thing = gg)
[2:12:23] HiivaLoL: Again I don't mean to sound binary
[2:12:27] lol_bloo: aatrox cancels Azir after stopwatch, super clean Q
[2:12:41] HiivaLoL: It's just hard to be LNG
[2:12:58] archie7497: Monte it's pronounced heave-ah
[2:13:01] itachidarkflamemaster: pyke is bad
[2:13:07] HiivaLoL: JDG is just cc into death
[2:13:16] TheOnymous: Monte is it worth watching any of the asia games from last year?

[2:15:41] a_lonely_observer: Gala played this game like he was 0-4
[2:16:22] archie7497: @montecristo the lpl xin build has been sundered sky + rookern + frozen heart. They don't normally build titanic
[2:16:22] Nymaera_: great steal yeah
[2:16:36] Nymaera_: rell EQ does insane damage to objectives
[2:16:42] MrHandsomeNoodle: tarzan would never Kappa
[2:16:46] KevinLeMinion: you think the nerfs they did to damage in the game a few years ago have just reverted with the new items?
[2:16:47] Slayra: Rell Q damage classic
[2:16:50] YellowBirdPuzzle: PogChamp
[2:16:54] Tannrd: Feels like so many things went right for LNG but draft just impossible

[2:19:54] AzureCatalyst: I miss last years lng
[2:20:06] Rumblextristana: Who would you say is the 2nd best LPL team?
[2:20:53] ruiva: Dom is similarly heartbroken about his OMG losing their identity
[2:21:13] najafan: Tencent loves their viewers more than NA viewers

[2:22:39] Azeroth02: oki

[2:23:05] OvtForeverFall: NIP and TES 2024 are basically reformed OMG + TEES 2023
[2:23:41] OvtForeverFall: and TES even before that
[2:24:29] AzureCatalyst: I still can’t believe Rookie didn’t stay on TES and give us the 369 rookie and Jackeylove TES gogasuperteam

[2:25:37] HiivaLoL: poppy ban
[2:25:42] HiivaLoL: --> kalist ban
[2:25:44] OvtForeverFall: @AzureCatalyst I think it has something to do with not going to the military in KR this year
[2:25:46] HiivaLoL: wow
[2:25:50] HiivaLoL: you dont see that in europe
[2:25:55] HiivaLoL: you just see kalista FP randomly

[2:27:14] Slayra: rewatch PepeLaugh
[2:27:22] HiivaLoL: any opinions
[2:27:31] AzureCatalyst: also is Flandre just in this series to be stable because JDG is worried about their rookie running it down?
[2:27:35] Clyde1500: I missed that previous game can we go back? Kappa
[2:27:36] HiivaLoL: @Nymaera_
[2:27:44] HiivaLoL: oh

[2:28:01] ogoaxe: Chiiiina
[2:28:11] hotblew1337: Senna lanes rlly strong into xayah rn
[2:28:25] HiivaLoL: I just think Xayah sucks as a blind esp in 123
[2:28:30] OvtForeverFall: @AzureCatalyst I think it has something to do with the age limit
[2:28:32] SkippyPeterson: senna kench bye xayah
[2:28:38] Slayra: all of this just to get rolled at worlds by KC classic
[2:28:57] HiivaLoL: you can play any long range comp (EVEN EZREAL, REGARDLESS WORLDS)
[2:29:15] HiivaLoL: theres mages

[2:29:20] Tannrd: you can mute the tab on browser
[2:29:24] HiivaLoL: but from a general add

[2:30:10] Fissiccisst: Just turn off script blocker and let the chinese streaming service into your computer
[2:30:10] Tannrd: Its easier and more fun to just complain about it
[2:30:17] hotblew1337: @AzureCatalyst flandre prolly just won his spot cuz hes better rn
[2:30:22] ZerosAgent: Can we have dragon timers kind sir BLUBBERS
[2:30:26] HiivaLoL: and caitlyn ofc !
[2:30:30] lololojsgus: wait, caitlin is back?
[2:30:34] HiivaLoL: yes
[2:30:36] HiivaLoL: xayah*
[2:30:53] thisisKakashi: is karma mid presence higher than in western regions
[2:30:58] najafan: For maximum auto spacing
[2:31:00] ogoaxe: Holy, if his age is an issue in China, it must be really bad.
[2:31:14] kerokerogrips: didnt the LEC also pass a rule about 18+ rosters, but then not have any 18+ sponsors ?
[2:31:18] AzureCatalyst: He must be 12 or some shit if they're actually cracking down on him not playing in the LPL
[2:31:29] TheOnymous: Any thoughts on the battle royale genre for esports?
[2:31:34] AzureCatalyst: Like I remember Zztai playing when he was way underage
[2:31:42] Tannrd: Pretty sure Sheer is 18
[2:31:45] ogoaxe: @AzureCatalyst Yeees, exactly the one who came to mind
[2:31:54] thisisKakashi: does blg comp feel like it lacks damage late though
[2:32:09] najafan: Malignance
[2:32:18] MellowMelos: You make up with it by being a better team xdd
[2:32:33] najafan: If they
[2:32:34] hotblew1337: @Tannrd he is
[2:32:35] HiivaLoL: sadly it's 6:51 am and I need to sleep, gn and have fun people
[2:32:36] Phaetox: Karma mid is so good
[2:32:44] AzureCatalyst: @HiivaLoL GN!
[2:32:45] archie7497: Although karma won both games. The ap build looks hit or miss. Imo karma should go enchanter items after maligma
[2:32:46] najafan: If they're team fighting, yeah, BLG is in trouble
[2:33:03] najafan: But they've messed up by getting to that point
[2:33:52] thisisKakashi: i guess it's up to execution, excited to see knights karma
[2:34:14] PulseVibex: with lucin meta thats important
[2:34:37] Tannrd: BLG is the reason every other team thinks Lucian is good
[2:34:37] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:35:00] PulseVibex: BLG is the meta
[2:36:38] Slayra: Stare
[2:37:45] Manjiji: other regions only saw zeka corki, so figured they didn't need to play it LUL
[2:37:45] najafan: Maybe they're only watching Keria games.
[2:37:52] najafan: Er, Zeka, yeah
[2:38:01] najafan: lmao
[2:38:02] PulseVibex: keria corki monkaW
[2:38:06] thebelkman: man the competitive scene is so night and day from LPL to LCS
[2:38:21] archie7497: It takes too long to come online. Atleast that's what I think the lpl teams believe
[2:38:21] thisisKakashi: yeah lcs is so much more competitive right
[2:38:24] najafan: Brain was on autopilot, KEKW
[2:38:35] PulseVibex: LCS xdd
[2:38:43] QuackTheDuck: is power spike today?
[2:38:45] Esterifikace: such a tragedy
[2:38:49] AdmiralReggie: saying he got "caught" on the trap is being generous.
[2:39:05] ibshoots: Caitlyn ever go lethality?
[2:39:36] AzureCatalyst: Hmmmm
[2:39:51] hotblew1337: Hang would have lived that dive

[2:40:18] PulseVibex: thats tough
[2:40:25] AdmiralReggie: Clap
[2:40:27] thebelkman: clean
[2:40:35] archie7497: Mark pulling a targamas
[2:41:21] Slayra: Marc ? xdd
[2:41:42] MrHandsomeNoodle: xdd
[2:41:49] PulseVibex: xdd
[2:41:57] JaYaJ: xdd
[2:42:22] AzureCatalyst: I think Xun might be my LPL native Jungler GOAT at the moment
[2:42:36] PulseVibex: 4/0 already
[2:42:47] AzureCatalyst: iwdGOAT Tian ain't my cup of tea since he hard inted Rookie all those years ago
[2:42:49] archie7497: Xun ran this entire game
[2:42:55] AdmiralReggie: feel like them contesting that ward so heavily should've been a tell.
[2:43:02] AzureCatalyst: But Xun has been fantastic the last 2 years
[2:44:13] Marksman91: makes tower dives look easy
[2:44:13] AzureCatalyst: JESUS
[2:44:19] AzureCatalyst: That trade from LNG was disgusting
[2:44:44] thebelkman: these nami bubbles have been so on point
[2:44:46] boomersh0t: caitlyn is getting hit non stop by these bubbles
[2:45:16] AzureCatalyst: I feel like Cait bullies Lucian enough in lane and her power trough in midgame alligns with Lucian's spike in the midgame and she's just so much more useful past 3 items
[2:45:16] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:45:28] najafan: I love watching good Lee Sin play
[2:45:39] AzureCatalyst: XUN MY GOAT
[2:45:39] Marksman91: Xun timing
[2:45:41] spucky117: every time i see a porfessional cait... it just pales in comparison to guma
[2:45:43] AzureCatalyst: get a 3 man kick
[2:45:51] archie7497: @montecristo also I'm pretty sure the apbe milio combo was only for 14.1 before his lethality was nerfed
[2:46:05] archie7497: *aphelios
[2:46:14] PulseVibex: what is mao supposed to do now
[2:46:24] PulseVibex: does he cross map or stay bot
[2:46:26] unclemiketheinformant: @FakerRizzing look for ganks
[2:46:41] AzureCatalyst: I want to see if the Kog Braum lane was just an LEC flash in the pan or if it's still viable with the new items
[2:47:05] najafan: Dear lord Nami
[2:47:09] AzureCatalyst: G2 Kog Braum
[2:47:15] Tannrd: Aiming made Kog look great
[2:47:21] maletroll: braum not quite meta
[2:47:27] Tannrd: Kappa
[2:47:31] AzureCatalyst: A bit
[2:47:34] AzureCatalyst: Kappa
[2:47:48] AzureCatalyst: Oh god
[2:47:53] AzureCatalyst: Please god no mroe AP Kog nightmares
[2:47:57] Tpro83: That would be alot of mana for Kog ult spam
[2:48:05] AzureCatalyst: I still have fucking nightmares from when the last time he was meta as an AP artillery mage
[2:48:05] najafan: Only Insanity will have the courage.
[2:48:06] Tannrd: I think its just worse Corki no?
[2:48:07] EdizInts: I thought the same thing, AP Maligma kog seems like it would be stronger than the previous ap kogs
[2:48:15] zanchu: @najafan maybe Caps too
[2:48:16] spucky117: does malig proc on kog e?
[2:48:25] najafan: @Tannrd Different Corki.
[2:48:32] AzureCatalyst: If we have a hellscape of AP Kog and Midlane Corki and Hwei, I'
[2:48:35] LilGimli: and 2800g seraphs after next patch
[2:48:35] AzureCatalyst: I'm blaming youy
[2:48:51] najafan: AP Kog tends to build more utility focused items
[2:48:59] AzureCatalyst: AP Kog, Mid Corki, Hwei is my hell midlane meta
[2:48:59] najafan: Like Rylais
[2:49:03] EdizInts: The range is insane too, there's also quite a few good poke comps already
[2:49:03] wryjester: Was playing AP kog in aram. It's pretty nasty.
[2:49:04] najafan: And Liandries
[2:49:13] PulseVibex: wait i was thinking kog should be played like a week ago
[2:49:15] archie7497: @montecristo but kog doesn't use the ability haste on r at all
[2:49:21] Esterifikace: corki will surely get nerfed right? Clueless
[2:49:31] Tannrd: PowerOfEvil is still playing right? I'm sure he is cooking up some crazy things
[2:49:42] AkibaBoi: It's not *that* loud for us anyways, it's about same volume as your voice
[2:49:42] Fissiccisst: Wait, what about....malignence Pantheon?
[2:49:49] najafan: I asked Palafox if he'd try it even in soloq, and he refused, said that there's no dash.
[2:49:49] Tpro83: Team wide blue is good, I agree. But a team playing Kog runs the risk of being run over and having blues taken away. Becomes an obj to fight over.
[2:49:54] unclemiketheinformant: powerofevil builds were always dogshit
[2:49:57] 1xhealth: cn servers
[2:50:01] spucky117: god this lack of dragon timers makes me question everything
[2:50:04] AzureCatalyst: I think the zones of control created by the R and Malignance might actually make him disgusting in Drake standoffs
[2:50:20] najafan: Claimed Jayce was only viable because of massive MS buffs from Lethality items.

[2:50:51] Esterifikace: I am sure this will go well
[2:50:53] 1xhealth: wtf lmao
[2:50:55] AzureCatalyst: Holly
[2:50:57] Tpro83: It's a mechanical nightmare
[2:50:57] AkibaBoi: GIGAXUN
[2:51:01] spucky117: wei knocked him out
[2:51:04] AzureCatalyst: That went so much more poorly than I t hought it would
[2:51:06] najafan: @unclemiketheinformant Runeglaive Ez?
[2:51:20] Zarenkai: are billibilli vods bad? (the website not team)
[2:51:27] AzureCatalyst: Holy
[2:51:31] AzureCatalyst: That is so clean
[2:51:34] Phaetox: Showmaker was playing ap kog and having a blast
[2:51:37] AzureCatalyst: I'm so impressed that they survived that
[2:51:38] unclemiketheinformant: that was a pretty bad corki package
[2:51:43] najafan: HALF HEALTH FROM Q
[2:51:47] najafan: JESUS
[2:51:48] HoodsShadow: did weiwei knock nami out of corki package?
[2:52:04] EdizInts: LNG is really speeding up the pace of the game, for BLG
[2:52:10] 1xhealth: they peeled rlly well tbh
[2:52:33] spucky117: @HoodsShadow thats what i saw
[2:52:40] najafan: And Karma is destroying people already
[2:52:45] PulseVibex: can maokai just go top instead of diving bot all game or no
[2:53:01] Esterifikace: idk lpls lucians hit different, I have never seen lucians dmg fall off
[2:53:01] unclemiketheinformant: yeah, but can we talk about how bad the corki package was? @MonteCristo
[2:53:19] bigplaystevizzle: Xun going crazy
[2:53:25] PulseVibex: lpl lucian hit different
[2:53:33] Tannrd: Corki package just isnt high dmg yet
[2:53:41] Tannrd: unless in a choke
[2:54:14] unclemiketheinformant: DUREX!
[2:54:16] maletroll: BLG walking the LPL this year
[2:54:19] MoonFall24: every champ knight plays hits and moves different, the mandarin effect
[2:54:21] najafan: Appropriate ad for that last fight
[2:54:23] boomersh0t: lol the durex sponsorship
[2:54:26] Esterifikace: its just so clean, Knight stepping slightly back so that xun can hop to him
[2:54:38] archie7497: BTW not only is there no dragon timer. The pro's are playing on a bugged map. The elder dragon after soul spawns 1 minute earlier at 5 minutes rather than the standard 6 minutes
[2:54:45] spucky117: yeah they control the choke... and they have cait
[2:54:53] Esterifikace: @boomersh0t its fitting as lng just got fucked vicksyNoted
[2:55:07] EdizInts: I think they should at least be able to get nami if they played properly
[2:55:10] PulseVibex: thats true just get turret if they run that far back
[2:55:14] EdizInts: cait was literally not apart of the dive
[2:55:47] EdizInts: I agree with that idea, the risk vs reward profile isn't great at all
[2:55:47] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[2:55:50] Edge2G: durex ad kek
[2:56:56] PulseVibex: yeah you dont need to kill necessarily
[2:59:08] Tannrd: Elk the only ADC to successfully drive the herald
[2:59:08] EdizInts: This game is basically over, other than maokai ult they don't really have anyway to engage, even that isn't the best
[2:59:29] najafan: They can engage with package :)
[2:59:42] EdizInts: Even into ksante? I feel like you need a really good angle
[2:59:54] archie7497: Normally whenever cait is meta you will see less of her in lpl compared to lack cuz lpl teams just focus on breaking the cait lane with ganks.
[2:59:54] PulseVibex: looking for drake fight could be spicy
[3:00:07] archie7497: *lck
[3:00:29] Tannrd: do any regions have pro view anymore?
[3:00:37] Esterifikace: lpl has
[3:00:45] najafan: Any freezers?

[3:01:13] lolznaga: is Zika freezing or is it the vod?
[3:01:17] archie7497: @tannrd lpl has and I think lck has one tied to skt sim promo plan or something like that
[3:01:34] PulseVibex: this is disgusting
[3:01:43] EdizInts: Drake and baron up, but we just fight at their base entrance
[3:01:44] PulseVibex: oh!!
[3:01:48] Esterifikace: xun xdd
[3:01:52] Stozypokes: Thats one way to make a game a banger
[3:01:54] Tannrd: Why did Xun go in at the end there lmao
[3:02:14] PulseVibex: solo q moment
[3:02:15] Tannrd: 700g shutdown
[3:02:50] najafan: Malignance Karma Cloud Soul
[3:02:57] najafan: Full mast.
[3:03:00] Stozypokes: Just flexing tbh. They know that it doesnt fucking matter, right?
[3:03:24] fartnugget45: that lee sin play was so fucking bad
[3:03:25] NewZuu: he thought he hit zika XD
[3:03:27] PulseVibex: wait he actually did it
[3:03:32] Esterifikace: he for sure thought he hit aatrox so he would kill him
[3:03:32] fartnugget45: just handing 1k gold to aatrox
[3:03:41] MrHandsomeNoodle: im surprised the LPL is taking over a week off for the super bowl. american football is more popular in china than i expected Kappa
[3:03:44] Nimosenpai: even if it was zika
[3:03:45] Tannrd: its probably worse if he kills Zika cause then Cait or Corki get the 1k
[3:03:47] Nimosenpai: he stilld ies there
[3:03:53] unclemiketheinformant: even then, that's a silver play. giving up a 1000 gold bounty for nothing
[3:03:57] profound23: Bins scoreline is top lane
[3:04:00] najafan: @MrHandsomeNoodle They're big Taylor Swift fans
[3:04:13] PulseVibex: definitely not the best play ive seen
[3:04:16] Esterifikace: but it makes the game more fun so I am ok with it
[3:04:45] MrHandsomeNoodle: monte doesnt want the pro players to have fun anymore, only work. smh when will his tyranny end PepeHands
[3:04:51] archie7497: No joke Lee could win if the q was on aatrox. He would get triumph + sundered sky heal
[3:05:12] EdizInts: @archie7497 Doesn't really matter tho as its still incredibly int
[3:05:13] unclemiketheinformant: They really aren't that far ahead. Lee sin has the most gold on their team and what the fuck does he do at this point in the game? @MonteCristo
[3:05:26] fartnugget45: lee sin flashes out just to q back in and die lmfao
[3:05:29] Vurkexyz: thats the 7 kill lee sin heat check
[3:05:30] PulseVibex: on getting the kill too lol
[3:05:30] smparrish_95: xun’s body was telling him yeas
[3:06:00] fartnugget45: best case scenario is lee sin kills aatrox for 300 gold, and then gives over 1k gold to corki or cait. Honestly insanely braindead play
[3:06:00] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:06:03] najafan: Half the gold lead is on Lee KEKW
[3:06:04] QuackTheDuck: Why does east lucian look so much better than west lucian
[3:06:10] Rysikoss: to be fair, when you hit 1st lee sin Q, you gotta hit the second. It's a rule
[3:06:16] PulseVibex: west luci suk
[3:06:32] PulseVibex: corki hurts now
[3:06:36] archie7497: But the corki was not on top of the cait/ aatrox. He was chasing karma
[3:07:15] EdizInts: @archie7497 he was right next to them
[3:07:22] najafan: Lee just builds tank now
[3:07:52] unclemiketheinformant: honestly, if you freeze the game here, I say LNG is probably likely to win. Lee Sin having all this gold is tragic
[3:07:53] PulseVibex: lng needs one more throw right before drake and winnable now
[3:08:02] fartnugget45: you see they nerfed eclipse+malig interaction in latest patch?
[3:08:40] smparrish_95: pleb question: what was the interaction?
[3:08:42] fartnugget45: yeah apparently malig dmg wasnt flagged as proc dmg
[3:09:03] najafan: @smparrish_95 A Corki rocket with Malignance would trigger both Eclipse procs
[3:09:03] Tannrd: I dont think thought of a champ buying Eclipse + Malignance together. If only there was time before a season starts to test these things
[3:09:19] BigMightyena: Classic Rito games
[3:09:48] smparrish_95: damn
[3:09:49] Tpro83: Neat
[3:10:16] mjoll_the_hotness: does his gatling fun interract with that also
[3:10:19] mjoll_the_hotness: gun even
[3:10:27] PulseVibex: karma lucian nami trio is crazy oppressive
[3:10:34] najafan: Malig is for ults
[3:10:36] killerpineapple1: they labeled it a bug too which is crazy to me they didnt hotfix it
[3:10:39] direpants2: sounds like it was intended by riot
[3:10:54] DrakeAcula: @direpants2 doesn't and wasn't
[3:11:18] Tpro83: Monte, I've been playing Renata Glasc with Malignance. How shameful is this?

[3:11:23] archie7497: Bin casually Bing chilling at 0/0/0 at 27 minutes in game lmao
[3:11:24] killerpineapple1: its like 20% max hp too or some shit
[3:11:27] killerpineapple1: its so much dmg
[3:11:27] PulseVibex: corki 3 items now
[3:11:30] unclemiketheinformant: just dodge the rocket, monte. 5head
[3:11:38] Tpro83: I like R
[3:11:59] kerokerogrips: wasnt it 2 years ago that he corki was also rocking ludens builds , seems like corki poke builds comes and goes in cycles
[3:12:00] Tpro83: How did you know?
[3:12:15] Tpro83: Monte checking my opgg
[3:12:18] Tpro83: LUL
[3:12:20] killerpineapple1: he felt you out lol
[3:12:26] najafan: Hexplate Kog might be interesting as well
[3:12:28] killerpineapple1: if your ults always up then your always winning right?
[3:12:37] mjoll_the_hotness: monte seen some shit he can read minds now
[3:12:37] najafan: Outside of AP Kog
[3:12:54] PulseVibex: blg not throwing anymore Sadge
[3:12:55] Tpro83: Oh, dont do that. You might like the journey more than the destination. LUL
[3:13:02] Tannrd: Dont speak too much of Hexplate Malignance Renata, Hyli might hear you
[3:13:09] Vurkexyz: aram mid 30 mins
[3:13:26] killerpineapple1: @najafan now that makes me wonder if malg eclipse will work on him too
[3:13:36] Tpro83: Uhhh... I forget off hand.
[3:13:42] killerpineapple1: wild guess 30 secs
[3:13:45] najafan: @killerpineapple1 This stream is an AP Kog enjoyers safe space
[3:14:08] ADrugge: 0 CD, because you get Axiom Arc as well.
[3:14:09] Fissiccisst: Would it proc off teemo shrooms?
[3:14:15] PulseVibex: what does the new eclipse do
[3:14:23] PulseVibex: yes fizz
[3:14:24] najafan: Yeah, the theory crafting for AP Kog doesn't tend to use Eclipse for that reason.
[3:14:28] Tannrd: Also Kog R is generally easier to dodge
[3:14:33] killerpineapple1: the mobility really stunts him but i wonder if after the patch they had the foresight to patch him too or jis it just corki lol
[3:14:35] killerpineapple1: yes
[3:14:36] smparrish_95: it’s interesting. bLG inted and the game slowed way down lol
[3:14:42] killerpineapple1: it even triggers 2 or 3 times
[3:14:48] mjoll_the_hotness: well teemo is pretty much spawn of satan so
[3:14:55] Vurkexyz: well blg is outscaled now
[3:14:55] PulseVibex: saw it on aram
[3:14:58] PulseVibex: it works
[3:15:18] Tannrd: why did ON heal lmao
[3:15:31] QuackTheDuck: so when ksnate uses ult he zooms as well?
[3:15:39] PulseVibex: yea cloud soul is perfect
[3:15:46] PulseVibex: ocean would be good too
[3:15:53] archie7497: Btw this game would be a perfect example of not building ap on karma. You are so outranged that it's better to build enchanter items after malignance. Also the karma shield is turbo vs corki poke
[3:16:21] najafan: Eh, I think you can do Liandries after Malig
[3:16:21] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:16:40] PulseVibex: no ap then though
[3:16:50] hashtagzongrips: It’s tough only having one damage dealer tho
[3:16:53] Vurkexyz: this aatrox is hella farmed
[3:17:06] mjoll_the_hotness: well i would go utility in all games if my adc was elk
[3:17:15] Tannrd: They are already quite low on dmg, Karma being support would make it even more on just Elk
[3:17:55] Tpro83: @MonteCristo so on RG, at level 11, it goes from 130 sec cd to 70 sec cd. Also with CDR boots included.
[3:17:59] killerpineapple1: @FakerRizzing yeah theres just better items he could go too like the shadowflame low hp crits and cypt bloom he would prob deal way more dmg
[3:18:15] QuackTheDuck: wow that buffer is such a kokblock
[3:18:25] tylerjenkinz: if only you had Comcast Kappa
[3:18:25] weak_mental_renekton: how good is unending despair? (the new armor item)
[3:18:26] QuackTheDuck: I was gonna finish from that fight
[3:18:31] PulseVibex: wow they are fighting for elder before baron
[3:18:49] Tannrd: Weiwei cant wait for the next game, miserable experience for him this game and its not even his fault
[3:18:51] archie7497: @fakerrizzing no joke the removal of pen stacking items has made all AD team comps not bad. I've seen solo tank maokai ap win in lpl vs azir xayah
[3:18:58] AdmiralReggie: 5Head
[3:18:59] Tpro83: CDR very helpful for solo q madness
[3:19:00] najafan: "NO:
[3:19:00] mjoll_the_hotness: supa kicka

[3:19:33] PulseVibex: he’s confident
[3:19:36] PulseVibex: gg
[3:20:12] Tpro83: I thought that the other day too
[3:20:30] PulseVibex: new players down bad for sure
[3:20:33] Tpro83: You would need flash cards of basic purposes to study
[3:20:34] mjoll_the_hotness: he should try poe and see the skill tree next
[3:20:35] najafan: How can you tell the difference between Ornn, Nami, Glasc, and Maokai ult?
[3:20:42] Nimosenpai: you really need a lot of group pressure to have the motivation to learn this game nowdays
[3:20:44] Tannrd: Thats why you just pick Yuumi and dont learn what any other champ does
[3:20:49] kerokerogrips: i picked up league after watching arcane , at first i tried to drown people in kindness but the toxcity got to me , know i just play aram and pick tanks for fun
[3:21:00] wryjester: And whats crazier still is you don't have access to all the champs to help learn.
[3:21:09] archie7497: @montecristo what if I told you I haven't played a single minute of league
[3:21:36] najafan: Visually, how does a new player distinguish between those four ults and know what they do?

[3:29:45] Oskuheh: Only hypetrain hat missing
[3:29:46] Krethas: @TheOnymous I was thinking the same! Also, I just realized that I mixed up the two Mamoru film makers again.
[3:29:50] Deadriller: MonteSilco
[3:29:52] TheOnymous: Wait who is Vi and Jinx's dad supposed to represent then?
[3:30:00] mjoll_the_hotness: imagine if they used some classic monte quotes on him
[3:30:02] drooler2: u get paid for that ? 🤣
[3:30:04] Fissiccisst: @TheOnymous Doa LUL
[3:30:14] gspotted98: Nah the hair is completely different

[3:30:57] MrWooody: PepeLaugh
[3:31:00] mjoll_the_hotness: oh no PepeLaugh
[3:31:08] Krethas: @TheOnymous Yeah. Though honestly, other than GitS (which I suspect Thorin has already watched), I can't really name anything else they'd cover.
[3:31:11] Cigafiy: why do people at riot not like you?
[3:31:13] Deadriller: @TheOnymous Not a representation, just Warwick before Singed made him Warwick
[3:31:15] A_MericanPelican: “all characters depicted are fictitious… except Silco”
[3:31:32] najafan: There's also a really nasty interpretation of Silco's treatment of Jinx + with how things with down in Renegade.
[3:31:39] T1_HARDSTUCK_KR_MASTER: riot is ccp coded

[3:32:00] kerokerogrips: wow , I thought you would have been PNG from riot events
[3:32:06] Tpro83: Riot doesn't like Monte because Monte holds them accountable to ANY standard.
[3:32:09] resinduck: looool
[3:32:09] najafan: @Cigafiy Because he criticizes them
[3:32:14] ogoaxe: Sweet summer child
[3:32:16] Fissiccisst: You know how some teams get that mind control the other teams into doing bad stuff? That's you with Mind Controlling Riot into putting you into Arcane
[3:32:23] Clyde1500: monte did something horrible. he asked them to pay the casters reasonable wages
[3:32:24] smparrish_95: @cigafiy in Monte’s words, “he’s the cockroach that won’t die”
[3:32:36] mjoll_the_hotness: do you have 20hrs of storytime
[3:32:56] DelTacoMan87: do you dislike riot as a whole or just the esports people?
[3:33:06] Tpro83: This story is called: Fellowship of the Caster
[3:33:15] ThatLatvianGuy: Richard told that a dev, forgot if it was Riot or Blizz, sent out a warning on slack "RED ALLERT RICHARD LEWIS IS ARRIVING" due to a vaguely similarly looking guy even when he was in a different continent
[3:33:31] najafan: That would require acknowledging that he exists.
[3:33:34] roy_stang: rito paid him 4 raspberries to cast and he complained
[3:33:40] T1_HARDSTUCK_KR_MASTER: ur soft-banned
[3:33:46] najafan: @ThatLatvianGuy It was Riot

[3:34:14] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo are u still mad at riot for renegades?
[3:34:18] Warromancer: why you don't like riot?
[3:34:23] Oskuheh: I suppose truth hurts
[3:34:34] ThatLatvianGuy: @Warromancer xdding
[3:34:43] Bladetykon: now we need to get richard and monte into a riot event
[3:34:44] unclemiketheinformant: @Warromancer he was an owner of a team, and they basically forced him to sell and fucked the value of the team
[3:34:50] kerokerogrips: @Warromancer brother there are a lot of articles written about riot and their legal trobubles
[3:35:11] ThatLatvianGuy: hit the button next to 1080 maybe

[3:35:55] smparrish_95: chat is about to monte into a solo four horsemen episode lol.
[3:36:05] bornofthesun: you’re asking “Montecristo” if he’s still mad at someone who wronged him…
[3:36:08] gspotted98: but u are still covering their games?
[3:36:08] ThatLatvianGuy: @MellowMelos riot is different to the regular corpo evil

[3:36:21] Komarimasita: @bornofthesun LMAO
[3:36:29] najafan: People, TO THIS DAY lie about some of the specific things that went down in Renegades to blame Monte, even when the people involved said other things.
[3:36:30] StealingYoIPZ: @MonteCristo do you think you would have been in a better place if you just not talked about caster salary so publicly? maybe not burn too many bridges?
[3:36:35] ThatLatvianGuy: next to 1080

[3:37:59] iPwn20: Really happy you popped up under recommended channels I was wondering what you were up to.

[3:39:41] mjoll_the_hotness: wonder if caedrel will return to casting when hes made nice bag for secure future
[3:39:46] MoIIari: @najafan because she knows how to use her status in negotiations
[3:39:46] Nimosenpai: compared to eastern languages, definitely
[3:39:54] bornofthesun: Monte the next KC coach? hmmm
[3:40:03] najafan: Rhetorical guys
[3:40:06] najafan: Rhetorical
[3:40:07] Tpro83: I started speaking some French and felt like starting a revolution.
[3:40:15] Boldflavorz: Boldflavorz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:40:17] azzlo3: I did 5 years of French in high school and could never speak it properly, I've also almost entirely forgotten it now
[3:40:22] MissingMatter: You just have to look at the words and pronounce about half the letters.
[3:40:26] archie7497: @montecristo apparently caedrel said he made shy of 1 million last year cuz the ad-rev + subs from twitch is terrible for eu streamers and he didn't have that many sponsor activations. I doubt it but but that's what he said
[3:40:26] e1tft: I wanted to take Spanish when I went to school, but it wasn't an option, ended up with German instead
[3:40:27] unclemiketheinformant: did latin in college. fuck that shit sucks

[3:44:55] nautcholibre: should I be watching on YouTube or twitch I subbed on YouTube
[3:44:55] GPAlexander: @najafan its hard to be invested in the culture of a country whose geopolitics is "we want your shit and one day we're gonna take it"
[3:44:59] Esterifikace: @najafan if they ''dont care less'' does it mean they are alos obsessed with china culture?
[3:45:22] Tpro83: @Esterifikace I think it's the same as "Couldn't care less"
[3:45:26] e1tft: so,  riot doesn't copyright strike proplay footage, right?

[3:45:48] Tameimpala2: watch on youtube with twitch chat pop out 5Head
[3:45:58] najafan: @Esterifikace Colloquial language is real.
[3:46:05] Hadland4331: Thank you so much for what you and all the other league people do at LFN. Love all the podcasts, makes work bareable to have a lot of stuff to listen to. <3

[3:47:12] Clyde1500: couldn't let dom look good
[3:47:20] weak_mental_renekton: Since phreak is the head of the balance team, does that mean a small group in NA balances the game for the whole world?
[3:47:22] GPAlexander: whats the LPL have against english viewers?
[3:47:23] ThatLatvianGuy: scramble to not have dom be the lpl jesus
[3:47:30] kootra_maack97: thanks

[3:47:34] wyzrdsnvrdie: @universal_mvm not Monday through Wednesday
[3:47:46] najafan: Who was Dom gonna have cast btw?
[3:47:52] najafan: Just the regular casters?
[3:47:57] archie7497: C'mon riot only had the lpl broadcast cuz they could let dom and caedrel be the hero and make a community cast cuz riot is narcissistic like that
[3:48:03] Aoyos_: Riot needs a LPL English broadcast to keep Dom from taking it over
[3:48:03] ThatLatvianGuy: @GPAlexander like 30-40k of us, we're worthless in comparison to millions of chinese
[3:48:16] TrendNation69: why did they do that? it felt like the interest was growing in the lpl from english viewers
[3:48:17] e1tft: back in the day, was there ever a world where you persued casting not league, like dota, cs, etc?
[3:48:26] archie7497: Riot deserve no praise for the lpl cast
[3:48:44] kerokerogrips: china doesnt want to win through culture :(
[3:48:46] smparrish_95: isnt LPL English views relatively low anyways?
[3:48:51] TheOnymous: Know anything about the Japanese lol scene?
[3:48:52] cenet1: Why does LCK care about foreign viewership and LPL does not?
[3:48:53] ThatLatvianGuy: @najafan dom was gonna hire casters to do the eng side

[3:49:22] Tpro83: RaccAttack I don't watch LPL. I need more LCS RaccAttack
[3:49:24] mjoll_the_hotness: does anyone know what kind viewership hype games get in china or is it impossible to know
[3:49:45] AddOneMoreThing: That sounds really dumb leaving money on the table
[3:49:46] AztecKniight: Yo yo, latest NA game dev employee who just got laid off today, at least i got 2 months of severance LUL
[3:50:00] AdmiralReggie: @AztecKniight SeemsGood
[3:50:02] kerokerogrips: kinda hard doe , what korean company wants to advertise to a demographic across the sea

[3:50:18] najafan: @kerokerogrips Samsung.
[3:50:28] GPAlexander: Imagine Shien sponsoring the LPL English cast.
[3:50:31] TheGreatKatzby: zika got his ass with flash ignite burn
[3:50:35] MissingMatter: @kerokerogrips It doesn't have to be a Korean company sponsoring it.
[3:50:39] AztecKniight: i got 3 years out of the job, high key so over the industry lol
[3:50:43] Aoyos_: @kerokerogrips T1 literally partnered with Comcast

[3:51:38] Knait0: RIOT
[3:51:41] Tameimpala2: they dont? the fuck
[3:51:48] Double_Hitt: Durex should be a global sponsor not just LPL
[3:51:52] nautcholibre: “Fuck this” *full screen Monte
[3:51:52] najafan: Why isn't there an Alibaba sponsorship on LPL?
[3:51:56] archie7497: Cuz it makes too much sense monte

[3:52:30] Tameimpala2: is there other vehicle brand sponsors on other english broadcast?
[3:52:32] najafan: Alibaba loves US clients, wants to compete with Amazon.
[3:52:37] najafan: Why isn't it on LPL?
[3:52:39] Knait0: True, we get only korean ads on lck english brodcast
[3:53:03] Knait0: I will I could buy the bbq chicken :(
[3:53:12] vrozeus: Why was weiwei building black cleaver first?
[3:53:22] Komarimasita: 2 bbq chickens opened up in my town last year. im in heaven
[3:53:30] Tpro83: I like to imagine Riot doesn't sign deals with people who don't fistbump.
[3:53:40] smparrish_95: wym. riot is really good at sponsors. #ftx
[3:53:47] Tameimpala2: Dududunga probably the best ad on the LCK eng broadcast ever
[3:53:58] GPAlexander: foreal where are the H Mart sponsorships theyve opened like 500 locations in the US.
[3:53:59] TrendNation69: does riot in the us handle all the english broadcasts?
[3:54:05] Daigusto_Emeral: Is LCK viewership on the downturn/upturn or has it plateaued
[3:54:07] najafan: @GPAlexander TRUE
[3:54:15] lolznaga: It was in the recommended tab in the shop
[3:54:29] lavagen: thoughts on todays games?
[3:54:34] nautcholibre: How do feel about NA playing on live patch do you think it hurts or helps them, how does it  effect other regions if at all? @montecristo

[3:55:03] MariusBarrage: himself kekw
[3:55:07] dah777: naut autos Kappa
[3:55:10] KnowP4in: naut aa :)
[3:55:14] najafan: Like, it's just a grocery store. Everyone needs groceries. And LCK English's target demo is young PMCs.
[3:55:28] MrKealy: i think its decent for single target dps, gives some bulk and dmg. the ms is nice on him in fights, also bc applies on all physical dmg so his w would give him ms and shred armor. i dont think its best first item here but i know some xins run it for said reasons
[3:55:31] TrendNation69: do you still talk to LS?
[3:55:31] najafan: They're gonna get groceries and not feel bad.
[3:55:39] Big_Dew: seems like everybody should be on live patch, last week I was watching LCK and realized they're still doing double support item a month later
[3:55:49] najafan: And have enough money that they can do H Mart.
[3:55:50] stephcurrysim: innovative like drafting garen mid into taliyah sejuani varus renata
[3:56:10] smparrish_95: means LCS can play like LCS instead of poor man’s LCK
[3:56:11] TrendNation69: @big_dew I think they don’t do it to mainly avoid bugs
[3:56:15] najafan: It's a great idea. Why is this not something that riot is working on.
[3:56:27] Startl3dDx: xun just sold his entire team
[3:56:37] archie7497: But na hasn't been that innovative outside of the obvious buffs to champions. The only innovation comes from insanity who gets his picks from ls cuz they talk to each other
[3:56:43] Big_Dew: what if you consider the double support item that got hotfixed a month ago, a bug in itself
[3:56:44] KnowP4in: @najafan they fire al the ppl that could do it LUL
[3:56:59] Startl3dDx: xayah no summs or ult is painful

[3:57:35] TrendNation69: @archie7497 Some of the 100T or SR drafts are quite interesting, I think NA teams do try different drafts
[3:58:25] nautcholibre: I like it cause it feels more connected with solo q
[3:58:44] Nimosenpai: what's going on with these colors on the rift theyre inaccurate to me
[3:59:12] weenteen1: did i miss the lng vs jdg vods?
[3:59:22] archie7497: @trendnation69 sr I understand since insanity is on the team. 100t is just cuz Riven is snipers og onetrick. It's no different from apa ziggs or adam darius
[3:59:28] Tpro83: NA needs to adopt the Renata CDR strat. Hire me C9.
