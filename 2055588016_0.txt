[4:03:58] Lazynameross: unlocked riot account
[4:03:59] shaco_sdn: phase rush?
[4:04:05] ETMartians99: does he have to get a win on every champ?
[4:04:08] ThomasTheTwink: @crooktwentytwo league parrtner program
[4:04:27] ETMartians99: gotcha
[4:05:03] ThomasTheTwink: oh i thought hob jayce i guess he has a built in hob though
[4:05:06] s0me_d00d: are you going to try asol again with the new buffs?
[4:05:07] ArgonateVT: Havent watched your streams a while, how you doing?^^
[4:05:11] DJMariks: i feel like jayce supp should be fun. lots of poke
[4:05:17] NicVilll: zil top
[4:05:19] bladetrinity16: @criticwhospeaksfacts agreed, and on his channel the pic is too small for me to get his mains name
[4:05:45] ArgonateVT: I am good too^^ currently a bit to addicted to spam rell games xd
[4:05:48] ThomasTheTwink: im a tad Scared of the fed aatrox
[4:05:52] McCoyeBoy: I just played vs that zil lol
[4:05:57] adnips: mata played jayce support in lpl once Aware
[4:06:00] pyrosui: I can see the title of the youtube video now "Stunt smurfing in diamond with his challenger jayce support technology"
[4:06:03] Eriiales: is it same Zilean?
[4:06:03] bladetrinity16: @crooktwentytwo also its not all skins, LPP doesnt include prestige skins
[4:06:18] criticwhospeaksfacts: how many challengers can there be in each server generally?
[4:06:28] ArgonateVT: Yeah thats true, felt that but wouldnt be cool if she had no downsides
[4:06:28] hiimawarii00: @Eriiales Unfortunately :(
[4:06:33] criticwhospeaksfacts: coz i swear everyone says they are challenger
[4:06:33] bladetrinity16: @criticwhospeaksfacts depends on size of server, but NA is 500 i think
[4:06:40] bladetrinity16: or 300
[4:06:56] yabootybutt: does spankers yell at u
[4:06:57] adnips: you're not hip with the kids

[4:08:34] bladetrinity16: so fun part of red side is that you can see the other side of that bush, but you cant on blue side
[4:08:38] criticwhospeaksfacts: the amount of streams i've swifted through and their title says 'challenger' makes me wonder, if they get challenger just once and get hardstuck in GM does it even count?
[4:08:50] Cariyla: @criticwhospeaksfacts no but they think it does YEP
[4:08:51] adnips: these spell icons are ugly
[4:09:10] Cariyla: They peaked challenger in s12 once or something and now have it perma on their stream YEP
[4:09:10] ArgonateVT: The add was against me participating in the bet xD

[5:10:45] Jakmo: You don't max E on Mao supp so it's a tiny nerf
[5:10:47] Thorrennn: what made mao so strong this patch anyway?
[5:10:59] pyrosui: The real tree that needs a nerf is ivern
[5:11:16] Jakmo: can engage freely, barely punishable, survives forever, wins 2v2s easily, that's why he's good
[5:11:17] Apostolique: Maybe Riot thinks that if he becomes too good, people won't play him since he is boring
[5:11:26] kyraaleesong: Nidalee buffs for Aram SICK bla

[5:12:18] Apostolique: I'm sad, 14.02 was my favorite patch
[5:12:26] pyrosui: and then we never have to see him support again
[5:12:35] Jakmo: good, nerf the stupid cat
[5:12:40] zthaniel: heyo!
