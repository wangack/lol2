[1:13:46] razer_mon: ipavKEK ipavKEK ipavKEK
[1:13:54] Waldmonk: yes, and also the mythics that didn't quite fit with all the useless mana
[1:14:28] razer_mon: league might be getting better
[1:14:41] razer_mon: but players still brain dead
[1:14:57] DCraven_0ne: some people prefer not to walk around with 3k gold on them, like a certain someone :P
[1:21:15] Ski_Mask_the_Drug_God: Teemo sup in lower ilo feels nice rn, zoning adc to hard
[1:24:24] 2cansyams: hey what do you think of the QOL changes to teemos q next patch
[1:27:38] AfricanPaladin: @2cansyams what QoL?
[1:29:46] razer_mon: gg
[1:30:02] razer_mon: report jg mom xdd
[1:30:34] SpringSong: what is qol?
[1:30:37] 2cansyams: in 14.3 patch notes it said they are changing the way the blind is applied
[1:30:50] 2cansyams: quality of life
[1:32:08] justname: Chatting
[1:32:08] SpringSong: weird guy
[1:32:25] justname: He didnt
[1:32:27] justname: KEKP
[1:32:30] justname: KEKL
[1:32:33] SpringSong: even tho if you gona base why you ping ''im coming''
[1:32:59] razer_mon: @justname KEKED
[1:33:52] SpringSong: q ready ult ready ur ignite ready  gragas has no flash
[1:33:58] SpringSong: that was a freekill
[1:34:52] LtChezo: @ipav999 QoL Adjustment: Teemo Q blind should now immediately apply to targets hit by the Q, preventing Teemo from taking damage from an auto attack after the blind has been applied. Blind duration should now also be consistent with the debuff duration above the target’s health bar.
[1:35:42] LtChezo: it seems like it isnt a huge change they are just making it do what its supposed to do
[1:35:49] SpringSong: thats why he stay stuck in dia cuz when she faces good jungler who just dont ignore free kills like vi did gona win againts her
[1:36:19] LtChezo: @ipav999 https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-14-3-notes/
[1:37:46] LtChezo: it seems to me like the teemo q wasnt acting how the tooltip said it should
[1:38:16] RipYourRng: fudge i too kthe wrong runes
[1:38:27] SpringSong: probably blind stay longer than it must be and they just fix it cuz teemo still dominates low tier even after nerfs
[1:38:27] RipYourRng: fleet into cho is that ok? @ipav999
[1:38:52] SpringSong: so basically they lower the blind duration
[1:39:11] SpringSong: that what I understand from that patch note
[1:41:19] SpringSong: '' Blind duration should now also be consistent with the debuff duration above the target’s health bar.'' I mean that sounds like teemo blind isnt stay same as icon on enemy hp bar
[1:41:56] ficulus: Q is not blinding just autos? abilities also?
[1:42:02] bruno_sjc88: good night
[1:43:22] GarrettVG: ok but the ping isnt the only difference
[1:45:18] Pitju99: it's a 4th of the avg human reaction time
[1:45:24] Pitju99: i think
[1:45:45] HOPE_Ismail_Abi: 0.5 is your delay 0.04 is his delay
[1:46:03] bruno_sjc88: my friend Lord Semi caught challenger with more than 180ms and in several regions, just playing rammus
[1:46:31] aurateal: its absolutely huge

[2:03:28] thegreatone188: What is more op - teemo shrooms or shaco boxes?
[2:03:48] aurateal: @thegreatone188 neither of them
[2:04:09] Pitju99: @thegreatone188 they do different things but both are kinda underwhelming imo
[2:04:47] razer_mon: XD
[2:07:52] Pitju99: go deathcap
[2:08:23] Pitju99: awkward gold
[2:11:13] RipYourRng: @ipav999 i just mr7 teemo
[2:12:00] hashtagzongrips: Shroom cd so long Sadge
[2:12:58] Pitju99: yone has no chill
[2:14:11] matheusgusmao00: Yesterday I made lvl 4 Camile quit the game when I was playing Teemo. You're a good professor, Ipav.
[2:14:23] Yd_89: Bu ne kadar reklam la
[2:15:31] thegreatone188: Luc nami still op. Waiting riot finally nerf their bond
[2:15:40] Pitju99: isnt it sell nashors
[2:16:06] Pitju99: I guess its good to match yone with it
[2:16:14] Pitju99: NOPERS
[2:16:27] Pitju99: nvm hg good item
[2:16:49] istivere: yone r hitbox is super wack
[2:17:33] Mr_G00SE: Yone feels overtuned imo but I am shitter so idk
[2:17:59] Pitju99: hourglass is kinda necessar anyway
[2:18:06] Pitju99: its not like u can dodge zed r
[2:19:13] Pitju99: Idk just zed R E auto at this point might kill you without HG armor
[2:20:19] SpringSong: HR is just 2.5 second delay to death it most of the time useless
[2:20:41] Pitju99: not against champs like zed
[2:20:48] Pitju99: and armor is rly good this game too
[2:21:00] Pitju99: also counters yone snapback
[2:21:02] SpringSong: maybe at earlie game which is HR 3250 gold isnt easy to get earlie
[2:21:44] Pitju99: nah the later you have it, the more burst you can mitigate in that 2.5 seconds
[2:21:49] Pitju99: so its usually better latr
[2:22:05] SpiralCycle: This streamer is look very skil.
[2:22:09] SpringSong: after lv 13+ HR wont save you from zed or yone anyway and if ur team not good or stupid when you put zhonyas actives you gona die after 2.5 sec anyway most of the time useless
[2:22:11] ヒグイデ: astral GG
[2:22:39] istivere: man that darius
[2:23:14] SpiralCycle: Put some spect on teemo's name PunOko
[2:23:27] Pitju99: @springsong teemo was strong this game, its doing more than just death delay imo, but that can happen.. plus team does exist
[2:23:50] SpringSong: like I said 3rd time it mostly useless
[2:24:20] SpringSong: and this kind of game not happens everytime
[2:24:26] Pitju99: k I'll stop arguing
[2:25:19] Pitju99: learned from his master, yasuo
[2:25:57] Pitju99: @ipav999 when you based on 1k maybe buying amp tome into Sflame was better
[2:26:04] Pitju99: instead of wand
[2:27:54] SpringSong: what about Aatrox garen?
[2:28:02] Pitju99: is Tahm still undecided?
[2:28:16] Pitju99: Aatrox Garen are fightable without it
[2:29:23] Pitju99: even against cassio best chance might be PTA try lvl 1 coinflio
[2:30:30] 300PingKing: !runes
[2:32:20] Pitju99: honestly if you asked every lobby how your jungler would do first clear
[2:32:28] Pitju99: I wonder how that would go
[2:32:39] Pitju99: i dont think ppl would chat enough for it tho
[2:33:06] Pitju99: You dont tell them, just ask them
[2:33:13] Pitju99: ehat theyre gona do
[2:33:21] Pitju99: Unreliable though yeah
[2:33:43] Pitju99: Yeah ask them how they clear just extra info
[2:33:54] Pitju99: dont force em to change
[2:34:48] Pitju99: knowing lvl 3 topside situation better
[2:36:44] thepiwi98: hey ivan, who would yo say is the smartest player you have ever played with?
[2:37:57] Pitju99: they need all their brainpower for mechanics
[2:38:00] Pitju99: LUL
[2:39:01] thepiwi98: ad is probably the most braindead, but ofc you gotta be great mechanically
[2:39:20] Pitju99: just ask all teammates about their IQ scores
[2:39:22] Pitju99: Kappa
[2:40:19] thepiwi98: what about the most talented player in your opinion?
[2:40:39] Pitju99: his brother?
[2:42:09] razer_mon: ipavKEK ipavKEK ipavKEK ipavKEK ipavKEK
[2:42:24] Pitju99: the memes of him playing 20 games at the same time LUL
[2:43:10] Pitju99: he gathers ALL information
[2:43:14] Pitju99: its nauseating
[2:44:19] ParkingSeal: ParkingSeal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 59 months! 
[2:44:33] Pitju99: what I find crazy is that he can still control his champion well while doing that
[2:44:43] razer_mon: ipavKEK
[2:45:26] Pitju99: Its probably just catchup
[2:45:44] Pitju99: his strengths shifted slightly
[2:45:50] Pitju99: compared to others
[2:46:19] Jooelrbk: Hello brother, I'm from Argentina and I wanted to tell you that I'm your fan because I play teemo for you. But I can't get out of diamond xddd
