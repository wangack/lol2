[3:45:53] Sentety: Breaker is way better than 7
[3:46:00] Sentety: it might be used in the speedrun
[3:46:19] Riddleham: Breaker was used in speedruns for 7 because it has a strong early game and then it scales off into the worst class lol
[3:47:30] Sentety: btw Chris you didnt play yakuza 1-6 but just so you know Kiryu doesnt have the 3 stances in those the reason he gets them in this game is cause hes nerfed by cancer and hes reverting to his weaker stances instead of the real Dragon Of Dojima @SirhcEz
[3:47:48] Sumiko88: 14.3 out already?
[3:47:55] Sentety: you only played his real stance in Gaiden elaKek
