[0:06:26] Fhane: OOF
[0:09:07] koen967: I can already see the clips with sharpshooter
[0:09:09] Fhane: in pubs it's gonna be Q CD and wind up, in ranked/comp it might be ult and passive
[0:09:12] Fhane: for Wraith
[0:09:38] Fhane: Ah yea true
[0:09:54] Fhane: also PK wingman back? PausersHype
[0:10:08] koen967: Depends on the double jump range
[0:10:33] koen967: I can imagine if it is around the same range as the first part of echo tactical, it could be pretty good
[0:10:46] SquattingCow: ???
[0:10:50] Fhane: oh no
[0:10:50] koen967: These are pretty cool
[0:10:53] Fhane: It's a Katarina
[0:11:36] Zanolax: ??????????
[0:11:37] koen967: WHAT
[0:11:51] Fhane: LOL
[0:11:52] SquattingCow: NODDERS
[0:12:04] Fhane: double right side
[0:12:06] koen967: Watson meta
[0:12:06] Fhane: all the way
[0:12:28] Fhane: ah yea true
[0:12:39] Fhane: you can hold the upgrade til ure in place right?
[0:13:05] SquattingCow: 50HP? meh
[0:13:22] koen967: How would amp interact with the gold knock was it?
[0:13:45] Fhane: DUDE, FUSE WITH WATTSON IS NO LONGER A MEME
[0:13:46] Fhane: HAHA
[0:13:47] SquattingCow: TBH the extra arc stars are huge, backpack capacity is SO limited
[0:15:04] Fhane: movement players valk arc? PausersHype
[0:15:06] woundedslayer: ive been up since 0230 and working since 0300 and i miss when you start stream early Deadlole
[0:15:30] SquattingCow: They can't slow down the EVO gain too much right? TTK will be so short if that happens.
[0:15:38] woundedslayer: i didnt realize you started
[0:15:40] J1o6ctep: How come actually? Her missile swarm is basically a baby version of fuse knucklecluster which often explodes before reaching target lol
[0:15:45] Torje: RatShake
[0:15:47] Torje: yo
[0:15:58] J1o6ctep: And while she's in jetpack mode she's so easy to target that it's basically liability
[0:16:19] koen967: Modern art
[0:16:53] koen967: Could you sign that and send me the NFT
[0:17:02] J1o6ctep: Huh, interesting point, so it's basically useful for int-elligence?
[0:18:19] J1o6ctep: Amped Reloads sounds like a blueprint for most annoying fortress setup
[0:18:20] SquattingCow: Think it means the placed Sheila
[0:18:45] J1o6ctep: I think Amped Reloads mean that while you're close to barricade you've got faster reload
[0:18:59] J1o6ctep: Like small barricade in Destiny 2 basically
[0:19:19] woundedslayer: damn im going to have to sign up for some classes at the community college to figure out what the hell is going on in apex now
[0:19:42] SquattingCow: I started playing Dota 2 again after 10 years, I'm so lost
[0:20:17] J1o6ctep: Shopping Spree would be cool if it works for all teammates, but if it works only for Loba then I'll pretend it doesn't exist
[0:20:33] J1o6ctep: Wtf is an energized zipline?
[0:20:34] woundedslayer: yuh shakey
[0:20:37] SquattingCow: energised ziplines????
[0:20:40] woundedslayer: back to my main
[0:21:40] koen967: Skipped Rev
[0:21:55] J1o6ctep: Can you make another tierlist for how legends in general would feel after this update?
[0:21:57] Torje: wattson might need her own tier, spawning arcs is wild
[0:22:34] J1o6ctep: Wattson is gonna cause Great Depression in fight economy
[0:23:06] J1o6ctep: You can also use two lightning bolts to indicate that this is specifically Wattson tier Kappa
[0:23:20] Torje: both of those first ones kinda bad
[0:23:22] koen967: Lore accurate perks
[0:23:25] Torje: but the nade one is better
[0:23:28] woundedslayer: lookUp oh no.... i just realized
[0:23:38] koen967: No
[0:23:42] woundedslayer: maybe change it to S+ tier
[0:23:58] Torje: roller only perk PepeLaugh
[0:24:00] J1o6ctep: That got me puzzled too
[0:24:00] SquattingCow: Controller Perks PepeLaugh
[0:24:16] peepoHappyPerson: what about fuse q and bang ult does it count as explosives?
[0:24:17] J1o6ctep: Like can't we change direciton in jump already?
[0:24:26] Torje: rollers cant lol

[0:26:05] SquattingCow: Wait.. engergized zipline. Does that mean enemies can't take Pathfinder's ziplines?
[0:26:05] J1o6ctep: 28 NAKED BAMBOOZLES IN THE SHOWERS ON THE KINGS CANYON
[0:26:47] SquattingCow: The 17 Mirage players left in the game will like these PepeLaugh
[0:26:50] koen967: The amount of bamboozeling is gonna be crazy
[0:26:59] J1o6ctep: Me and the boys and the boys and the boys and the boys... annoying all remaining 19 teams with my boozles
[0:27:30] J1o6ctep: Enemy in front of you? Bamboozle. Your teammate? Bamboozle. Your beloved mother? Believe it or not - bamboozle.
[0:27:34] Zanolax: THATS GOOD
[0:27:43] koen967: KEKW
[0:27:49] SquattingCow: -25%? No one sits in full Maggie drill
[0:27:58] koen967: Fireball is gonna be scary to run from
[0:28:16] swankyOven: killer handling is going to be soo fun
[0:28:27] J1o6ctep: Drill is a good area denial imo, good change
[0:28:37] koen967: Does it leave a trail of fire?
[0:28:52] woundedslayer: this is so much added to the game, i dont understand how they havnt broken everything in the code. they can barely reset ranks without causing bugs
[0:28:55] peepoHappyPerson: fuse become so good with 2 q charges maybe it will be the same with maggie
[0:29:07] Zanolax: Aware
