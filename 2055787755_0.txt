[7:19:57] Unano_D: buffs won't help him
[7:22:08] swoocer: More changed
[7:22:19] DevilBike: I think his return speed on creeps when he walks out of range and some healing on Q
[7:22:20] swoocer: He can technically... have 8 ghouls active at once
[7:22:37] swoocer: BUT jts very hard and unlikely to set up
[7:23:20] swoocer: So they made the ghoul spawn circle on his q shorter range right
[7:24:04] swoocer: So yorick can spawn 4 ghouls twice due to some weird mechanic of already existing ghouls not counting as the ones in the gerund anymore
