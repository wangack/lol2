[0:19:21] pureiinsanity: @5up u think offtank Asol can be a thing?
[0:19:31] pureiinsanity: something like ROA jaxshoe
[0:19:32] briweb11: I really like the music in the new video
[0:19:35] NamesBond_007: alrady watched and it was so funny
[0:19:35] Draconican: Titanic Hydrogen?
[0:19:48] 9fierce9: I watched the video even if i already watched it live
[0:19:50] balletbunny: patch notes still on screen
[0:19:51] FrozenLavaReflector: Isntt that just tge asol build
[0:19:53] 9fierce9: PeepoGiggles
[0:20:18] pureiinsanity: no i mean like even more tanky
[0:20:23] pureiinsanity: just for Q farming
[0:20:28] iorius: Morning chat hi 5up, is there an amogies lobby later?
[0:20:35] pureiinsanity: jaxshoe
[0:20:41] iorius: Yaaay
[0:20:55] pureiinsanity: im thinking ROA jaxshoe
[0:21:29] pdlemwkci: do the chat selecting champ thing on your main LUL
[0:21:41] FrozenLavaReflector: Okay. Thats 1 more wave than lost chapter
[0:21:44] rosierhea: #hn
[0:21:51] pureiinsanity: like at that point maybe dont even build AP after jaxshoe cuz passive will make Q do dmg
[0:21:52] FrozenLavaReflector: And ROA is cheaper
[0:21:59] FrozenLavaReflector: Asol doesnt need cdr
[0:22:01] pdlemwkci: scared? Kappa
[0:22:17] jeskieKAT: Hmmm is the music only playing while 5up is speaking
[0:22:23] PoteetLee: Hm.
[0:22:25] RinaVX: requesting nasus jungle
[0:22:32] jeskieKAT: Tyty
[0:22:40] pureiinsanity: too loud now
[0:22:51] pureiinsanity: @5up maybe play him top
[0:22:55] pureiinsanity: as tanky
[0:23:05] 9fierce9: What about the Vi mid that someone requested that someone suggested 2 streams ago huh? Stare
[0:23:10] PoteetLee: After that game you were playing the music is BLARING.
[0:23:10] mypreppydiaries: hey dude 5upWave
[0:23:46] pureiinsanity: Passive doesn't scale with AP
[0:23:47] PoteetLee: Scary man.
[0:23:49] PoteetLee: Don't do that.
[0:24:02] pureiinsanity: theres none
[0:24:07] pureiinsanity: unless you mean more takedowns
[0:24:11] pureiinsanity: cuz of dmg
[0:24:13] pureiinsanity: for E
[0:24:18] pureiinsanity: but thats like so fringe
[0:24:22] champrath: it doesnt need to
[0:24:34] pureiinsanity: i dont think you do go Rylai
[0:24:45] pureiinsanity: i dont think you care about AP at that point
[0:24:51] champrath: you rush rylais on asol or its troll
[0:25:06] champrath: he is designed around that item yep
[0:25:11] pureiinsanity: for normal Asol sure
[0:25:30] champrath: you never not go rylais on Asol first otherwise you are not a champ
[0:25:46] pureiinsanity: true
[0:26:03] champrath: tear into rylais is the best prob
[0:26:22] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[0:26:23] pureiinsanity: it might be tear
[0:27:08] RinaVX: play nasus jungle or else
[0:27:20] pureiinsanity: Seraphs does give you tankyness too
[0:27:26] champrath: Only time you can justify non-rylai rush is when you are against like Galio mid Sion Top bot Tahm or something
[0:27:35] champrath: but even then Rylais is stil better KEKW
[0:27:37] rosierhea: I like watching you play mid
[0:28:11] champrath: btw mid has less agency according to Riot stats then Adc-Sup-JG
[0:28:17] champrath: even though it feels like you have more
[0:28:33] champrath: Sup always had more
[0:28:42] pureiinsanity: i love watching him play yuumi for mental boom, and Renata
[0:28:42] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com

[0:55:37] ewwii_damncat: this song is such a vibe
[0:55:56] pureiinsanity: AD LB is still viable as support with Bloodsong and Cyclo
[0:56:23] pureiinsanity: Cyclo gives more Bonus for Dashes
[0:56:55] pureiinsanity: so you stack it insanely fast
[0:57:35] pureiinsanity: nah its fine
[0:57:49] pureiinsanity: you dont even have to proc fleet on useless minions
[0:59:14] SorayaSayo: @emmatheredpanda hi Emma just wanted to let you know I saw your dragons yesterday and they are gorgeous!
[0:59:37] pureiinsanity: @5up i mean you can try it on your alt, you go Cyclo RFC
[0:59:51] 9fierce9: that R was beautifully timed
[1:00:29] pureiinsanity: Fleet doesnt get waisted on minions, early levels you can out trade with fast combo's
[1:01:13] 9fierce9: but considering the R charged time and travle time, just lovely to watch
[1:02:11] SorayaSayo: why are we not on the smurf acc today?
[1:02:52] pdlemwkci: gm soon COPIUM
[1:03:05] SorayaSayo: and how is your dragon progressing?
[1:03:23] pureiinsanity: its always support btw @5up cuz AD LB doesnt like having to farm even tho she gets more gold, Bloodsong is more valuable and you aren't as squishy as some of the supports bot, + fleet doesnt get waisted value on minion procs
[1:03:38] VelvetLeveilleur: Hi, do you know if Irelia is strong/weak since the item update happened?
[1:03:54] champrath: @VelvetLeveilleur she always has been kinda weak unless you are cracked at her
[1:04:03] VelvetLeveilleur: I see, thank you!
[1:04:23] champrath: @VelvetLeveilleur she has really high skill ceiling but why play her when you can play akali ig
[1:05:25] balletbunny: i think they mean the dragon drawing
[1:05:29] SorayaSayo: the drawing not the game XD
[1:05:43] pureiinsanity: not being forced to build Statikk is too good too
[1:07:06] balletbunny: i drew a dragon leafling for fun after that stream sitt
[1:07:28] champrath: no cc against master yi thats trouble
[1:07:35] pureiinsanity: Soraka kinda dumpsters YI
[1:07:36] 9fierce9: Who would you say your best type of champion is, like poke, brawl, assassin etc
[1:07:44] champrath: @pureiinsanity hardly tbh
[1:07:50] SorayaSayo: Joker wants chat to poke you about the drawing so that’s what I’ve done. next stream then again…
[1:08:28] pureiinsanity: @champrath her E destroys him cuz his W spell is not a spell anymore
[1:08:47] champrath: @champrath against master yi you need a cc to stop him from attacking soraka doesnt have that

[1:09:32] SorayaSayo: understandable. I can’t draw even if my life would depend on it
[1:09:33] pureiinsanity: @champrath thats completly fine Soraka can position safer than carries so its harder for him
[1:10:04] veyvey4: 5upWave
[1:10:37] balletbunny: om
[1:10:43] pureiinsanity: at least when i played that matchup as Soraka it was so ugly for YI

[1:48:31] AkitaAttribute: The healing is pretty good with RoA
[1:48:46] town_owl: I love that the dragon mechanic is becoming infinite scaling. wouldnt mind if that also finds its way into the shyv rework
[1:48:47] Skilletidoo: Did shiv also get a buff?
[1:49:00] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Now we just need to get you playing panth and Shyv.
[1:49:01] NamesBond_007: then ad shivana for jungle and dragon skin avia for support
[1:49:04] Sadwikk: is RoA still just a weak item after the changes?
[1:49:07] NamesBond_007: all lane dragons
[1:49:43] AkitaAttribute: RoA is cheap, so I feel it's ok.  It's a really good mana rock that heals you.  It's not great for AP stats.  HP is decent.

[1:52:54] pureiinsanity: people should funnel smolder too
[1:52:58] Jules_vdc: the good old hypercary experience
[1:53:04] jeskieKAT: froggyNoted
[1:53:05] vsmilotic: i dont think slow scale champ will work well in pro play
[1:53:06] town_owl: pro play is already about funneling your adc to 3 items no? seems like he'll fit right in
[1:53:23] vsmilotic: u will get lane kingdom non stop
[1:53:29] LethalLlamas: I dont think you need to funnel. With good farming you can hit max stacks just after 20 minutes
[1:53:38] pureiinsanity: @vsmilotic why games are like 40minute slogs anyways
[1:54:08] AkitaAttribute: Pros should be able to hit it at what, 16 minutes?
[1:54:26] AkitaAttribute: Provided no ganks to their lane, which is unrealistic
[1:54:28] vsmilotic: @pureiinsanity which region is40 ? LUL
[1:55:09] Skilletidoo: Lololol glad that was dodged
[1:55:21] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: So, smolder in the LPL will max stacks at like 12 minutes?
[1:55:22] Jules_vdc: so smolder is worse in pro play, cause less random teamfights than soloQ
[1:56:16] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: LPL is famous for regularly having kill per minute or more games. Only some regions are cautious.
[1:56:23] Skilletidoo: How hard would it be to hit his E against pro players in land the stacks?
[1:56:43] PoteetLee: 🇰🇷
[1:56:51] PoteetLee: My home and native land.
[1:57:07] balletbunny: i watched a tiktok where a pro player hovered kat every game to dedicate it to his girlfriend named kat froggyLove
[1:57:08] AkitaAttribute: So in a vacuum, 20 minutes = max stacks with just minions if you stack every minion.    Bot lane you have a free set of champs to stack off of also (pros will dodge W a lot though).  So... Not sure.
[1:57:10] vsmilotic: kr is not that slow anymore

[3:58:22] cameron416: average graves
[3:58:24] flowtives: ye that's half of riot games games tho
[3:58:27] xPheonixs: people who play league (me included) are major masochists >_>
[3:58:28] flowtives: like valorant is just dogshit
[3:58:32] mercurial1o1: Leagues lit
[3:58:46] flowtives: riot games baby woooo
[3:58:50] flowtives: is there voice chat in this game
[3:58:55] xPheonixs: yes
[3:59:03] flowtives: oh probably for good reason
[3:59:03] EmmatheRedPanda: ngl, you described half the human population in general
[3:59:10] flowtives: wouldnt be surprised if kids were shouting interesting things
[3:59:14] AkitaAttribute: There is but only for party
[3:59:20] xPheonixs: ^
[3:59:22] Sol_Bebe: if there was voice chat in league it would be an absolute mess
[3:59:27] klerikvaira: how do you play moba without voice chat
[3:59:37] flowtives: see thats what i mean
[3:59:39] xPheonixs: there is party voice chat

[3:59:54] Meyra95: it has, but only with premates
[3:59:59] Niconiac: I'd be horrified if it had voice chat
[4:00:01] AkitaAttribute: They can't moderate it like they can with chat.
[4:00:13] JeffreySwaggins: voice chat is a blessing in dota, can just mute the toxic players easily
[4:00:15] Sol_Bebe: I think at this point in league’s life span riot is afraid of what the community can do with voice chat
[4:00:17] Tirmel: They moderate the voice chat in Valo?
[4:00:20] JustaStoopidDog: they do it for valo yeah
[4:00:20] pdlemwkci: true. I should be able to yell in vc and tell my teammates to off themselves thumpNay
[4:00:33] AkitaAttribute: Do they ban people for the vc in valo?  Valve couldn't for CS
[4:00:39] Sol_Bebe: there’s literally AI that is out that monitors voice chat that several games use
[4:00:42] cyeany407: you excited for urf to come out today?
[4:00:50] klerikvaira: You definitely can't play tactical fps without voie chat
[4:00:56] cyeany407: fair
[4:01:09] xPheonixs: you can do stupid crazy builds in urf XD
[4:01:11] Sol_Bebe: faceit a third party service for CS has a voice chat monitor system/AI
[4:01:26] JustaStoopidDog: dota 2 has voice chat and that game is waaaay more toxic
[4:01:36] klerikvaira: Yep, I have friends who don't pay league because of that
[4:01:41] EmmatheRedPanda: ...what does moba mean
[4:01:42] Drude27: I guess the only moba's I ever played were some of the old ones on WC3 and League so never had VC
[4:01:45] AkitaAttribute: @Sol_Bebe Faceit is a joke.  Their servers lag so hard.
[4:01:49] neonpaintedpigeons: 5upDance 5upDance
[4:01:52] JeffreySwaggins: nah league is way more toxic bro coming from a player of both games
