[1:30:37] Gar116: Huge loss streak
[1:30:52] noctroewich: yeah 160+ champs, millions of players
[1:30:54] Psychology___: I mean once you hit emerald it's officially like "higher elo" right so you get to deal with more of that bullshit
[1:30:54] noctroewich: crazy variables
[1:31:00] ViragS: i was in losers q for a month, like literally lost 1 won 1, and now im climbing, didnt change a single thing in my lpaystyle
[1:31:01] belallaj: whats your ban rn
[1:31:13] Soff199: i love your hair today btw, the mix between straight and wavy looks very nice. Dunno if it's intentional kaypLUL

[1:31:15] cobrakeiser: atleast Rengar is nerfed peepoHappy
[1:31:16] noctroewich: which fucks them too
[1:31:20] reallycreativ: I feel like when you eventually win, you're going to go on insane win streak
[1:31:35] noctroewich: like 3 weeks ago
[1:31:38] l4zyL3gz: I played my placements, ended up G1, now I lose every game xD
[1:31:49] reallycreativ: Every game had either Lillia,Brand,Miss Fortune
[1:32:21] Unchovekablex: What makes the game fun is champs being strong. What's important is that they occasionally change what's OP to keep things fresh. Best is to abuse what's currently powerful
[1:32:29] boros__022: after i played the first 5 game and won 2 games out of 5  i had a 13 lose streak XD
[1:32:35] shedfirekid1: riot gonna riot
[1:32:36] SnYpingNinja: amd Gragas also in the last couple weeks been on my team carrying the game
[1:32:43] belallaj: you are not alone the game is fucked
[1:32:53] FireK912: I've heard a LOT of people complaining about matchmaking in emerald
[1:33:07] Casyo99: My favorite season was season 3 and 4
[1:33:09] dalig_: I hate league right now
[1:33:10] belallaj: im on 1-17 streak
[1:33:12] WckedBlade: yep its the worse season
[1:33:25] SnYpingNinja: yh i miss season 3-5
[1:33:29] ani671: I miss season 3/4. kaypRiot
[1:33:36] dalig_: I get one shouted by tanks and my support goes lb daligCATflames daligCATflames daligCATflames daligCATflames
[1:33:43] WckedBlade: i stopplaying league as soon they buff garen and karma and illaoi in one patch
[1:33:44] Smoothcollie: The biggest mistake was the removal of the preseason kaypShame
[1:33:51] dalig_: shoted
[1:34:02] cobrakeiser: play karma KEKW
[1:34:17] jeiss_v: diamond/emerald doesnt feel that high elo when i got there, i still feel like im bad T-T
[1:34:19] Razmeck: @KayPea I agree something is very wrong with this season since start
[1:34:20] callmesky__: hello everyone! i got knocked out by the flu LUL hope yall r doing better than me
[1:34:27] Unchovekablex: Agreed, but that's close to impossible with so many champs. There's always be something that excels over the vast majority
[1:34:43] ani671: Maybe vex into karma?
[1:34:46] l4zyL3gz: Never take broken champs, just otp
[1:34:51] reallycreativ: I really feel the same, it's much more fun when there's different champs in every game
[1:35:04] Unchovekablex: Yeah, Karma is absurd rn
[1:35:09] Helinaw: lets not mention maokai who has 56% wr across all elos as support
[1:35:15] jeiss_v: like yeah ig emerald/diamond is top 10% but i think we are closer to a silver level verses a grandmaster/challenger
[1:35:26] gigachadgodsu: Siss, why Smoldereena is so cute when walking? kaypFreya
[1:35:26] cobrakeiser: sorry we fired that division of the company PepeLaugh
[1:35:34] belallaj: what about trundle.
[1:35:37] Me_Mike_: Maokai is so crazy
[1:35:44] shedfirekid1: I don't think they pay attention to the game and have no clue what needs balancing and why
[1:35:49] imperialninja: psssst @KayPea  good morning :D
[1:35:53] Sunnytinker: AHHHH MY EYESSS
[1:35:55] JustAnotherVoice: hey as someone who recently came back after many years and got forced into bronze you can bet your ass I'm abusing lillia to get out of the gulag down there
[1:35:55] Casyo99: 5 bans for 150+ champs is just crazy
[1:35:55] quark978: lovely shade of red
[1:35:59] cobrakeiser: Red carpet Sadge
[1:36:09] xBoomShotBaby: mine is the same
[1:36:19] gigachadgodsu: OMG  the lose streak is giving valentines

[1:36:50] J_to_the_jf: ya I hate that
[1:36:56] J_to_the_jf: it's like every second game for me
[1:37:07] tresher1: 1 game ?
[1:37:13] oskewow: kaypAnnoyed
[1:37:39] Psychology___: I think a huge thing is they balanced the game around mythics for 3 fucking years so now it's gonna take forever to get it back to the way it was
[1:37:42] reallycreativ: They are smurfing AND abusing Lillia,Miss Fortune,Trundle,Brand ect LUL
[1:37:43] J_to_the_jf: It's as if the people balancing the game are being told what to balance and aren't actually playing the game
[1:37:43] noctroewich: that's exactly how they came off when talking about the crit ADC
[1:37:50] noctroewich: like oh technically it's almost as good
[1:37:51] jeiss_v: i feel like they should consult chall/gm players as well T-T
[1:37:52] noctroewich: but it feels like shit now
[1:38:05] J_to_the_jf: it's not
[1:38:07] J_to_the_jf: it's really not
[1:38:19] J_to_the_jf: if Riot did things properly they wouldn't need to lay-off people
[1:38:20] Razmeck: Phreak Played Casters and Rangers...and he also did balancing...XD
[1:38:21] gryber72: what balance team KEKW
[1:38:21] shedfirekid1: "wow I played a game as karma and lost so it must not be too broken, time to look at the champs I lost to" - riot balance team
[1:38:37] SnYpingNinja: yea agreed. sucks about the layoffs

[1:45:57] Helinaw: @SnYpingNinja im master tier player but unfortunately the game cannot be balanced for only a few % of playerbase even though that would be the correct move
[1:45:58] Sunnytinker: no

[2:47:01] DemionDemon: get Nilah`d XD
[2:47:02] Niomah: Prime Capsules for me: here's a skin for a champion you have literally never played in 10 years, congrats
[2:47:08] HAYB3AR: and the smurfs this season is insane
[2:47:12] heeyysteve: LUL the amount of times I have had people say back "go ahead and report me (insert insult) It doesnt matter anyway" and it truly doesn't.
[2:47:21] IceQueenLisa: Im even worse, when I get bad teammates, I mean their behaviour, sometimes I wish that we lose, I would rather face a lose then see those win who keep insult others
[2:47:32] cheffy4u: Dont want to sound like a asshole but you soind depressed.
[2:47:38] DJ_Photik: What rank are you @hayb3ar bad games happen. Control what's in your control. You
[2:47:55] shedfirekid1: @HAYB3AR what elo are you? first time since season 3 i am bronze and enjoying the game way more lol. been gold/plat every season since
[2:47:56] MarcoKast: DFG PauseChamp
[2:47:59] ViragS: @cheffy4u lmao
[2:48:00] fearlessterp: I appreciated prime capsules because they gave us free things. I‚Äôm so sad they are going away
[2:48:07] Goriyay: does ziggs build any major cdr? ur r is insanely powerful it seems
[2:48:11] HAYB3AR: @shedfirekid1 Plat
[2:48:14] Goriyay: maybe cosmic to spam?
[2:48:19] DemionDemon: zhonya`s
[2:48:21] shedfirekid1: yeah that sounds right lol
[2:48:25] MarcoKast: i don't play the game, thought it may have come back
[2:48:31] Niomah: I liked the RP @fearlessterp  but I literally never got a skin for a champ I played from them all these years :D
[2:48:32] shedfirekid1: plat is worst elo i've been in
[2:48:41] HAYB3AR: @shedfirekid1 starting to feel that
[2:48:49] S17Master: Kayle 16
[2:49:00] MarcoKast: kayle flipped off
[2:49:10] HAYB3AR: People are soooooooo rude in plat. Like they die 2 times pre 10 mins and just give up
[2:49:12] KaiKazma: !EU
[2:49:12] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[2:49:26] MarcoKast: is that ad tf
[2:49:35] shedfirekid1: @HAYB3AR its the people who luckeed out of gold and think they're the best player ever because of it
[2:50:09] HAYB3AR: I'm trying to go for emerald this season, that's honestly the highest I wanna be. I feel like I really wouldn't enjoy the game any higher lol
[2:50:39] hurinthalion1337: Denmark <3 SeemsGood
[2:50:41] fearlessterp: @niomah oh same here I have so many freaking zed and yasuo skin shards just sitting there lol but more fun to have than have not kaypLOL
[2:50:49] ViragS: @HAYB3AR plat is full with lvl30 accounts or 7 season harstucks
[2:50:55] shedfirekid1: @HAYB3AR yeah it gets bad around diamond until you hit upper masters. I havent played ranked in a while but highest id personally go now is gold unless i had teammates
[2:50:58] HAYB3AR: But yeah its rough when  95% of my games have at least 1 smurf.
[2:51:09] heeyysteve: that Briar has Yasuo brain
[2:51:31] HAYB3AR: @ViragS fr ;-;
[2:51:46] ObsceneSanity: plus diamond+ is riddled with challengers
[2:52:01] Urmomsayswaddup: should I apply for a job at Riot üòÖ
[2:52:04] HAYB3AR: its the smurfs that shit talk to....like of course you're doing well in this elo xDDD
[2:52:17] rivkahwastaken: candy ziggs widepeepoHappy
[2:52:25] rivkahwastaken: widepeepoHappy
[2:52:28] bluesiies: as much as i love watching league videos where smurfs dumpster the enemy team i feel SO bad for the other team
[2:52:54] DragoonRed: the new mmr system should 'theoretically' help with smurfs not staying in the same elo as long and rank up quicker, since in game performance is now taken into account. so if they see someone go 20-0 a lot they should rank up super fast
[2:53:13] shedfirekid1: I had a game few seasons back with a 95% win rate smurf after like 30 games in plat. he died twice invading jungle and ran it down even though we were winning...
[2:53:22] shedfirekid1: so they're gonna be toxic regardless
[2:53:37] HAYB3AR: idk I like the thought of having multiple accounts, I just wish they were all in the same elo. Idek if that is doable, just rough and part of the game ig
[2:53:53] The1997wiki: dota 2 went into killling spree of  banning smurfs
[2:54:00] SauceSolutions: basically the equivalent to a bot game stomp and being proud of it
[2:54:05] d0gma06: that's why i don't play LoL anymore
[2:54:09] restrain_is_gg: That I feel like it's an issue but not the core issue.
[2:54:14] Siempje010: hai :D
[2:54:23] HAYB3AR: I feel like the performance isnt counted yet xD
[2:54:25] DragoonRed: "this season" is all the info we have last i checked
[2:54:29] ViragS: they said later this year thats all
[2:54:43] Siempje010: How yall doing ? How the games going sofar ?
[2:54:47] ObsceneSanity: it‚Äôs sort of in place. you can have diamond mod but the game forces you to go through the ranks still
[2:54:53] Napping_Sab: Sad part is when i won almost all my normals games playing champs i'm not used to or lane i'm not familiar playing but when i play ranked it's always a lost because of teams bad play
[2:54:56] HAYB3AR: I'm excited for that. I'm tired of losing but doing really well.
[2:55:06] HAYB3AR: and losing 30lp for it
[2:55:35] HAYB3AR: aatrox is disgusting
[2:55:36] shedfirekid1: jesus that nylah
[2:55:38] Goriyay: its almost like u pinged them off
[2:55:46] FiveFM: Mates twisted my arm to play the other day. 5/6/32 S+ on Nautilus support. Mad crazy game! I‚Äôve uninstalled and will never ruin the memory!
[2:55:48] darjar12: ggs
[2:55:52] jimbob_ywert: Through FF too?
[2:55:52] heeyysteve: you deserved a win there, WP KP
[2:55:56] fearlessterp: @urmomsayswaddup they just laid off a bunch of people
[2:55:56] RaeByrd_: PepeHands
[2:56:15] ViragS: i fing hate this game - every league player ever
[2:56:27] HAYB3AR: its literally an addiction
[2:56:30] Nikodermos: ^
[2:56:31] Goriyay: see its games like this where I think performance should play a factor in lp loss. now u lose more for something that isnt ur fualt
[2:56:32] tacobean1: Riot was like "we'll give her one win to give her hope"
[2:56:32] shedfirekid1: should have an anti-honor system lol
[2:56:34] Goriyay: fault
[2:56:41] IAmBogcsa: it's so sad that every time I come back to league every single player complains that the game has serious problems and everyone is depressed. like what the hell happened to this game
[2:56:50] ObsceneSanity: the mayor had not said a word since the one comment and briar hits them with a top gap comment
[2:56:50] Siempje010: bit excauhsted from work i  dunno mabey im overworking a bit  bosses are asking if i can clone myself xD because there is a shortitch on carpenters
[2:56:53] S17Master: @shedfirekid1 That would get abused to high heaven
[2:56:54] HAYB3AR: community happened xD
[2:56:59] jimbob_ywert: Can‚Äôt you just skip the honors?
[2:57:04] bunnyygirl: quantWave2 good afternoon
[2:57:07] shedfirekid1: @S17Master this is true
[2:57:16] Darkcyter: kaypWHAT
[2:57:19] J_to_the_jf: they need to add a "played bad" report it'll get the children soccer players off the ranked
[2:57:19] DJ_Photik: Angry
[2:57:26] bluesiies: i wish i could give an honor to an influential person on the enemy team. sometimes i have so much respect for how well they played
[2:57:29] SnYpingNinja: LUL
[2:57:43] J_to_the_jf: don't ban then for playing badly but ban them from ranked for playing badly
[2:57:43] Post_Maclone: almost seems like the game is the problem monkaHmm
[2:57:45] HAYB3AR: This is why i turn chat off most of the time. There are those FEW games where people are nice and positive but very few
[2:57:45] heeyysteve: how about if you successfully report someone Riot removes access to that character they were playing and takes their ability to buy that champ away for a time or just delete skins from their accounts
[2:57:47] S17Master: "Why flame after win" really just sums up how League players are
[2:57:55] DragoonRed: Yeah rito MMR has been scuffed forever. when i first started ranking (s3) I got to gold I was silver1 in promos playing against full plats with 3-4 bronze on my team every game
[2:57:56] WWClown: why you flame when you win game xD?
[2:57:56] eggramsey: D:
[2:57:56] belallaj: nah that was a one time thing
[2:58:03] jimbob_ywert: is this your main account?
[2:58:07] Napping_Sab: was it that account that was cursed when you were in NA?
[2:58:20] shedfirekid1: LOVE this song
[2:58:21] rivkahwastaken: manifesting another win
[2:58:44] DJ_Photik: That's what happens
[2:58:48] HAYB3AR: I had a rough game last week and I have 3 ppl on my team FLAMING the hell out of me
[2:58:52] Cut_n_Run: imo the win or loss is a bonus, but not really the take away. you dont learn from a win, you learn from looking at your performance
[2:58:56] IAmBogcsa: literally every time I tune into a stream or anything the player is depressed and keeps saying wtf is this game, this is crazy
[2:59:04] DJ_Photik: They have to play normals üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2:59:06] eggramsey: yep
[2:59:18] d0gma06: trick would be muted for ever
[2:59:20] bunnyygirl: Amen
[2:59:24] S17Master: Clap
[2:59:33] Archilles_lol: Remember back when they gave people chat restrictions for like 10k games lol
[2:59:40] norby75: RIOT has no balls to do something like that
[2:59:41] heeyysteve: but people will make new accounts no? feck em, hit them in the wallet and take the IRL money skins away right at the start
[2:59:42] SauceSolutions: Ban the account and ban their IP.
[2:59:46] shedfirekid1: this is why I have started only playing ranked flex over solo... can't stand random teammates even if my mates are bad they aren't toxic as hell
[2:59:48] HAYB3AR: @Archilles_lol lololol
[2:59:50] Frozenfruit13: losing that much of the player base would be a huge loss I fear
[2:59:54] e_Lumos: where is the like button? i wanna click it
[2:59:54] redeux: @KayPea or do like other games. if youre caught cheating youre qued with other cheaters
[2:59:56] Gossamer_DT: that is the problem riot doesn't want to cute of players that pay  money and they make money of of transfers
[3:00:11] redeux: if you troll you get que with other trolls
[3:00:13] Post_Maclone: buying RP actually clears reports from their track record
[3:00:14] iebullet: everyone would be just reporting everyone hoping they get banned
[3:00:28] Casyo99: I don't understand the game anymore the balance is so stupid I can't
[3:00:39] Casyo99: I love this game but it makes me so mad I stop playing
[3:00:40] Niomah: I like the idea of putting all the bad actors into a separate game queue and give them all a taste of their own medicine for like a month
[3:00:41] eggramsey: ty for putting ads between games kaypFlower
[3:00:45] lilCACTUSS9: @Post_Maclone fr
[3:01:10] HAYB3AR: I've been playing league for 11 YEARS now. Idk how to quit unless they get rid of the game tbh lol
[3:01:25] LyonAoi06: Or at least deseable they rankeds games for that toxic players
[3:01:26] d0gma06: hate Q
[3:01:29] Archilles_lol: Think Dota has this
[3:01:31] DragoonRed: @HAYB3AR League 2 is supposed to come out in 2 years :D
[3:01:32] heeyysteve: hahaha, I like that. Put them in the shit league together
[3:01:33] LyonAoi06: Disable
[3:01:37] LyonAoi06: Sorry xD
[3:01:42] HAYB3AR: @DragoonRed tf is league 2 xD
[3:01:57] eggramsey: stuck in coop vs ai jail
[3:01:58] DragoonRed: @DragoonRed they are making a new league on new technology idk anything aside from that
[3:02:07] IAmBogcsa: serious question: why do people keep playing? there are always serious problems and everyone is pushed to their mental limits, no wonder so many OGs quit
[3:02:08] FiveFM: If everybody on both teams are inting and trying to throw on purpose‚Ä¶ who wins?
[3:02:10] mrry2k: id pay to read the chat logs from games like that if the queue existed
[3:02:12] Niomah: If they can put me in a low priority queue because their crappy client crashed and dumped me out of champ select, it can't be that hard to do
[3:02:12] HAYB3AR: I want the mmo and i might leave xD
[3:02:13] PlumParts: angy
[3:02:14] Rincewurst: those queue times will be horrendous
[3:02:27] d0gma06: and can you report ppl in that Q?
[3:02:29] DragoonRed: @HAYB3AR I want the MMO too the estimated release for that is 2028 last i heard tho got a while to wait :(
[3:02:29] redeux: @HAYB3AR if its like cpunterstrike 2 its the same game with a 2 next to it
[3:02:32] heeyysteve: Riot call's your parents and has a serious talk with them and reads your chat to them LUL
[3:02:32] shedfirekid1: @Rincewurst not when the majority of players fall under it lol
[3:02:33] Gossamer_DT: you can't lock to IP to many players don't have a static IP
[3:02:33] S17Master: @Rincewurst Part of the punishment
[3:02:46] chleibinki: heeelllooooooooooo ü´∂üèº
[3:02:49] GibsonGaming: not hard to change IP
[3:02:52] HAYB3AR: @redeux and overwatch 2 lol
[3:02:53] chleibinki: how are you today?
[3:03:03] HAYB3AR: @DragoonRed ughhh i hope its soooo good tho
[3:03:03] markella_andri: where is baby kaypFreya ?
[3:03:03] Rincewurst: @shedfirekid1 bad wording on my end xD I meant normal queue times will be horrendous
[3:03:09] eggramsey: their toxic chats should be put on their cv haha
[3:03:12] redeux: i forgot about that lmao
[3:03:17] mrry2k: is it true that the more money you've spent on your account the more easy it is to get away with being toxic ?
[3:03:18] Gossamer_DT: I have 20 Static IP I can rotate them :D
[3:03:19] shedfirekid1: ohhhh yeah lol
[3:03:27] Niomah: I'd do it on purpose if they'd call my parents just to see them try to explain to two 80 year olds why their daughter was mean to a teenager in a game
[3:03:52] DragoonRed: @DragoonRed Yeah both me and my wife are waiting for it. we will be front runners on it really hope they do it well. but with most big company releases recently i feel like i need to keep expectations low XD
[3:04:08] Gossamer_DT: the problem is RIOT makes money off all the toxic troll players and until they decide to make the game a better experience and look past the profit it will never change
[3:04:12] HAYB3AR: I find myself CONSTATLY reminiscing when I was younger playing league. I enjoyed it so much. It got me through so much, was basically my whole childhood. I made so many friends and had fun. Its so different now. I miss it
[3:04:22] HAYB3AR: constantly*
[3:04:30] Sahmiran: Sahmiran subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! what do you do as mage when someone buys an 80 mr 400 hp item with %20 max hp shield ? i feel useless when even tanks oneshot each other
[3:04:30] FiveFM: KayPea is an anomaly. Immune to LOL‚Äôs personality infection mechanics. A fascinating case study. kaypSpy
[3:04:32] lilCACTUSS9: and for those few kind and genuine teammates. Rare, but they exist @KayPea
[3:04:37] DragoonRed: I feel like the best way to play league is generally with 4 like minded friends, but if you are playing solo q its you need to just focus on your own play and ignore your teammates or you will go insane
[3:04:44] restrain_is_gg: I love league of legends. Smile.
[3:04:49] innerpeace1: How many time did you done split push when your team trolling if u join teamfight?
[3:04:51] chleibinki: that‚Äòs a good mindset‚Ä¶ not everybody can hold this mindset on this game‚Ä¶ the rage is real‚Ä¶ that‚Äòs why I don‚Äòt play League of Legends very often at the moment
[3:04:58] HarbsCantina: @KayPea I don't feel well. Discovered today that the toothache I've had for 5 days was actually an infection that caused me to not sleep much or eat much over that time. Thankgod for antibiotics.
[3:04:59] Niomah: @Sahmiran All you can really do is ask your teammates who are AD to deal with them.
[3:05:03] IAmBogcsa: @HAYB3AR exactly, me too, I feel like so many factors are missing that used to make it so fun
[3:05:08] PlumParts: Win game feel nothing, lose game day ruined
[3:05:49] HAYB3AR: Like I even want a poro tattoo because of the fact league has literally been my childhood lol. Its just so toxic nowwwww
[3:05:51] J_to_the_jf: Riot is afraid to ban people because their player base is dwindling every year it's alive
[3:05:54] WWClown: the thing you dont understand is if they delet people they will lose money over time
[3:06:02] bluesiies: played vs a 5 man premade yesterday where 4 tanks funneled a Samira and it was HELL
[3:06:08] HAYB3AR: I'm in a toxic relationship with it xD
[3:06:13] Gossamer_DT: I have no friends so I have to be toxic :D
[3:06:21] Sahmiran: @Niomah so continue supporting others do plays i see thanks ^^
[3:06:38] shedfirekid1: clash was the best thing league has done recently and it's a limited time event lmao
[3:06:44] HarbsCantina: I couldn't even scratch my nose cos of the pressure
[3:06:45] HydroMerano: Good afternoon/evening folks! I hope everyone is having a good day so far. kaypLove_SG kaypLove_SG kaypLove_SG
[3:06:48] innerpeace1: Riot logic. If your performance good. You need to carry 2+ troller
[3:07:01] Martybggg: Have you tried Lux with Malignance 1st item?
[3:07:04] Niomah: @WWClown That's not really true. What it does is hopefully influence people to stop being didiots, and/or make the community less toxic which is better for bringing in sponsors
[3:07:21] aura_28: blackfrost?? <3
[3:07:57] shedfirekid1: @KayPea i feel attacked lol
[3:07:58] BettyBob: so losers queue and winners queue?
[3:08:10] S17Master: Great news, I don't have to imagine that I'm the worst League player ever üôÇ
[3:08:11] careesha15: stop calling me out like this kaypAnnoyed
[3:08:12] Gossamer_DT: go on I can see my self as the most shittiest player
[3:08:17] eNjizo: !followage
[3:08:18] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[3:08:21] FiveFM: Yes? You rang? shittiest lol player reporting
[3:08:22] HAYB3AR: I had a 10 win streak, now ive lost the last 7 out of 10 games.
[3:08:30] heeyysteve: but I AM shit all the time. Please stop
[3:08:32] rivkahwastaken: manifesting a win jenMoney
[3:08:34] HAYB3AR: riot literally will punish you for winning
[3:08:35] PlumParts: At this point I just hope the people that are in losers queue with me save me the strawberry flavoured crayons
[3:08:38] Gossamer_DT: wait Iron 4 is not the top level???
[3:08:39] Niomah: I was Bronze 4 last time I played ranked, like half a decade ago
[3:08:44] yumiiru: T-T
[3:08:48] Lazlowe_: I might be. Can‚Äôt know since I haven‚Äôt played since 2014.
[3:08:54] innerpeace1: I think you can win but . 1 ppl almost same skill as you. 1 player neutral skill. 2 bad player. Just play around these 2. To win
[3:08:55] restrain_is_gg: I've played league of legends once
[3:08:58] DemionDemon: dont underestimate the power of  Iron IV. Rick Fox is there.
[3:08:59] HarbsCantina: How you enjoying Denmark btw? Would love to visit there one day
[3:09:04] S17Master: I legit did place in Iron 4 the first time I tried Ranked LuL
[3:09:14] Psychology___: Maybe the vanguard thing will help a little bit with buying accs
[3:09:15] heeyysteve: oh shit
[3:09:17] innerpeace1: I think you can win but . 1 ppl almost same skill as you. 1 player neutral skill. 2 bad player. Just play around these 2. To win vs 5 good enemy team
[3:09:23] Niomah: Iron didn't exist back when I played ranked
[3:09:25] HarbsCantina: I've not played LOL in so long
[3:09:27] steviepewie: thats a nice idea honestly
[3:09:27] HAYB3AR: Back in season 3, I won 7 out of 10 placement games, I got bronze 5 and cried LOL
[3:09:29] shedfirekid1: actually not a bad idea using mastery as a gatekeep
[3:09:31] WWClown: so basicly what riot needs to do is when you buy an acc you have to lvl it till lvl 60
[3:09:32] 4braxis: yeee the mastery gate for ranked champs would be awesome
[3:09:36] J_to_the_jf: I mean mastery doesn't mean you're good at the champ you've just played them a lot
[3:09:44] bloodinesser: that could work, but mastery levels are locked until you pruchase them
[3:09:45] HAYB3AR: Literally just bring back twisted treeline and ill be happy
[3:09:52] an_lyze: an_lyze subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! yoooo
[3:09:53] shedfirekid1: only problem becomes when a one trick gets theirs picked or banned and dont have a champ at a certain level
[3:10:00] Niomah: @J_to_the_jf for master 6 and 7 you need S tokens
[3:10:15] sabiirox: can u show mords name
[3:10:21] HAYB3AR: @J_to_the_jf I had a 6 million point ekko on my team that was terrible
[3:10:22] innerpeace1: Anytime I see mmr doomed
[3:10:29] innerpeace1: I create new account
[3:10:34] ViragS: u can have mastery on 1 champ and if its banned than what do u do?
[3:10:42] S17Master: @J_to_the_jf Exactly, it means they have to invest time into the account before being dinguses in Ranked, which makes them reconsider doing stuff to get the account banned
[3:10:43] Gossamer_DT: I hate to say it, but I think that will just create more bots and buying an account will be 10 bucks instead of 2
[3:10:43] bloodinesser: i used braum a lot, but im not paying to unlock that. if i get it from a chest cool
[3:10:47] heeyysteve: but I play yas no matter what lane I go to Kappa
[3:10:50] huryagan: !followage
[3:10:51] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy

[3:11:14] ViragS: like in quickplay
[3:11:15] Niomah: You can't even play ARAMs without owning x amount of champs, so same thing would apply only with champs with mastery
[3:11:20] Tsatire: @Darkcyter kaypHello kaypHello kaypHello
[3:11:21] jimbob_ywert: 6 champion mastery 4 requirement maybe
[3:11:24] Darkcyter: @Tsatire 112 kaypPog CENTURION kaypCheer WB kaypHYPERS
[3:11:24] bloodinesser: if they would give you up lvl 4 with a champ mastery for free i would totally agree
[3:11:25] HAYB3AR: @bloodinesser I loveeeee braum. I got up to #43 NA this season with him. Then i started losing lol
[3:11:31] Post_Maclone: Shaco, all 5 lanes.  bet
[3:11:32] goticotropico: True there is just so many smurf accs floating around at this point. They need a premium queue where it's like ID or phone or something required to play on it to solve smurf issue I think.
[3:11:54] bloodinesser: @HAYB3AR hes a fun champ for sure =D gratz on making it to 43
[3:11:59] Rincewurst: people just wanna show how big their internet shlong is and kp here wants to gatekeep that PoroSad
[3:12:02] Tsatire: <3

[3:12:27] Martybggg: is there a sub that's close to 10 years of being subbed?
[3:12:40] HarbsCantina: love this song
[3:12:46] PlumParts: Did the game just recommended maxing wall on anivia or I just saw things
[3:12:48] DemionDemon: @melmar98 any lane Lucian is cringe
[3:12:55] Dezrunner: Haaaaaaaaaai Ms. Pea! How's the patient?
[3:12:58] ragtimediddly: geez when was the last time we saw a Lucian mid
[3:13:02] ragtimediddly: also heyyyyyy
[3:13:28] HAYB3AR: We got Sera, ziggs, swain bot and lucian, trist, ez, var mid lol
[3:13:34] DragoonRed: Lucian mid will alwaysbe a thing against  skill shot based champs cuz of hisdash and lane control
[3:13:41] innerpeace1: When I see adc mid I play ap malphite or fizz
[3:13:52] Darkcyter: @Dezrunner DEEZZZ
[3:13:57] heeyysteve: anyone here ever hear of and or use the gold players who would que non ranked to help beginners learn? It was free
[3:14:38] markella_andri: casino?
[3:14:51] ViragS: @HAYB3AR the element of suprise could win lanes

[3:17:08] Cut_n_Run: ok believers, i added a bunch of points for you to win
[3:17:13] HAYB3AR: Luckily with my alt accounts, I get placed around the same elo as my main.
[3:17:18] an_lyze: oh that poor bastard, that is awful
[3:17:20] FiveFM: @lewhitehd69 Shhh! it‚Äôs like Beetlejuice isn‚Äôt it!? don‚Äôt say it three times!
[3:17:24] ragtimediddly: is he no longer wisdomous?
[3:17:24] an_lyze: hope he's coping
[3:17:38] lewhitehd69: @FiveFM oh frick mb monkaW
[3:17:49] dreamonb: But then you can buy account with specific properly ranked accounts(correct mastery for champs you want). Still same experience for non-smurfs. I am pretty sure many streamers run with multiple accounts to minimize queue time(Tfblade being one of them). On top of that TFBlade had in some point an add for a site selling  lol accounts..
[3:17:50] CipherAdminShady: might just be a cursed week :(
[3:17:55] HAYB3AR: What made him get them out? Was he having pain?
[3:18:08] an_lyze: @lewhitehd69 kaypH5
[3:18:32] lewhitehd69: @an_lyze omg hellao ratirlKiss hows ur week been king? ratirlBros
[3:18:35] J_to_the_jf: dude the player base of League is growing but it's nothing but bad players. I dunno how long I can keep this up playing LUL
[3:18:43] SnYpingNinja: was he drugged?
[3:18:48] DJ_Photik: Cheer100 kaypHappea kaypHappea kaypHappea kaypHappea
[3:18:52] SnYpingNinja: anistiticed
[3:18:56] LilMonkiii: Hiii
[3:19:00] J_to_the_jf: it's childrens soccer and people that don't listen
[3:19:08] an_lyze: @lewhitehd69 good man! week is feeling long lol HOW IS IT ONLY WEDNESDAY?? you?
[3:19:09] HAYB3AR: I have all of mine still santorinFine
[3:19:17] FiveFM: Yeah, infections that close to your brain pudding ain‚Äôt good.
[3:19:23] dreamonb: is just a cost.. you pay extra
[3:19:28] DJ_Photik: Chinese bots
[3:19:31] J_to_the_jf: I mean in the last 3 months 250 accounts were sold and bought. Riot doesn't care anymore
[3:19:40] DJ_Photik: More opportunities to make money
[3:19:41] jimbob_ywert: that would immensely raise the prices in new accounts.
[3:19:47] S17Master: @dreamonb Do you think people just have infinite money irl?
[3:19:48] jimbob_ywert: it‚Äôs like inflation car
[3:19:50] jimbob_ywert: xd*
[3:19:59] J_to_the_jf: there's also the factor I can buy a masters account for 50 bones I lost hope in ranked a LONG time ago
[3:20:04] Post_Maclone: but how does all of that equate to selling more lux skins?
[3:20:09] dreamonb: currently nothing is banning them for multi account
[3:20:11] dreamonb: so point is moot.
[3:20:15] shedfirekid1: olaf bout to be an issue this game
[3:20:19] DJ_Photik: @j_to_the_jf hacked accounts??
[3:20:21] DragoonRed: At what point would the account sellers make enough money Rito would go and actually just have a fake company sell accounts for them for more profit? lol
[3:20:28] ceasar_jojo74: hello
[3:20:33] IIZER0I: Any idea when they will introduce the new Rank System? Think its called Trueskill.
[3:20:41] J_to_the_jf: @photikx no. Literal ranked acounts people grow and sell it's their job 250 in last 3 months were bought and sold
[3:20:46] lewhitehd69: @an_lyze LMAO dude i feel that one ratirlDed kaypLUL well tomorrow is aaalmost friday kinda kaypCreep kaypSpy im doing good, we got like 20cm~ish snow which is annoying but otherwise kinda chilling ratirlSit ratirlSit
[3:20:49] DragoonRed: @IIZER0I "This season" was all that was said not even this split
[3:20:53] darktalos548: Hello kaypHello
[3:21:08] psyhew: what do you think about being a certain honor level to play ranked?
[3:21:12] dentoro: hi
[3:21:13] J_to_the_jf: I lost hope in this game a long time ago Riot got their check from tencent and that's all there is too it.
[3:21:14] steelxdawn: You can ban all accounts....ITS CALLED HARDWARE BAN
[3:21:31] J_to_the_jf: Riot... We're "trying" to fix ranked, but here's a new skin instead Kappa
[3:21:35] Cut_n_Run: are we talking about limiting ranked to levelled up champs? that would help on new champs getting picked by people not knowing how to use them
[3:21:40] DJ_Photik: @j_to_the_jf better to just boost peoples accounts. More money to be made that way
[3:21:48] MrPanikz: yoooooooooooo
[3:21:57] kalmaaron: imagine if your ward placed when you first tried
[3:21:59] AVerySeriousBoy: I feel like a lot of the game would improve if they just got rid of All chat.
[3:22:08] J_to_the_jf: @photikx not really. Boosting is bannable selling accounts isn't because they don't give you the name of the account till it's sold so Riot can't ban it
[3:22:13] xBoomShotBaby: kaypTroll kaypLOL
[3:22:17] Martybggg: damn the bm LUL
[3:22:19] ragtimediddly: interesting plays from the scarecrow
[3:22:20] xBoomShotBaby: he even flashed
[3:22:22] bloodinesser: fid is giving real stalker vibe
[3:22:23] HAYB3AR: WHY U SO OBSESSED WITH MEEEEEEE BOI I GOTTA KNOWWWWWWW
[3:22:29] TTGChieftain: did your q go through him?
[3:22:49] DJ_Photik: @j_to_the_jf got it thanks
[3:23:00] J_to_the_jf: @photikx do not buy accounts tho it's shady and scummy
[3:23:04] xBoomShotBaby: Riot doesnt think so kaypAnnoyed
[3:23:04] Gossamer_DT: riot only needs to do one thing to fix the issue, you get ride of bots and that dries up the market for selling accounts, but I am pretty sure riot is making money off bot accounts some how and will never do it
[3:23:09] an_lyze: @lewhitehd69 yup its pre-friday tomorrow haha. Dang man that's a ton of snow, we've been pretty lucky over here and haven't had a ton
[3:23:17] HAYB3AR: @TTGChieftain Yeah she couldnt activate it because she was feared
[3:23:23] DragoonRed: they would have to change their honor system too as your honor resets every season (or use it as a you need to play norms to learn new season changes before ranked)
[3:23:24] hannah2125: riot doesn't care and never will. they only care about money
[3:23:28] bloodinesser: lol who is that popular angry league guy.... tyler, taylor...something like that
[3:23:29] belallaj: i dont think riot will ever upset their precious trolls
[3:23:31] DJ_Photik: Of course @j_to_the_jf i like my silver account anyways!
[3:23:42] hannah2125: @bloodinesser tyler1
[3:23:42] bloodinesser: he would be in trouble if he needed an honor rank to que
[3:23:58] steelxdawn: smurfing should be bannable.....they are ruining games and making a profit
[3:24:01] bloodinesser: yes!
[3:24:34] lewhitehd69: @an_lyze you dont have snow? are you suuuure you live in canada? ratirlDetective kaypCaptainMaple any weekend plans? POGGIES
[3:24:37] hannah2125: @steelxdawn yea, especially for new players in norms trying to learn the game. one of the reasons why this game is FAR from being new player friendly
[3:25:11] bloodinesser: @steelxdawn im low elo, like bronze, my placements had 4 smurfs, really sucked
[3:25:13] Bunnieees: Hi friends, hope everyone is doing well <3
[3:25:29] DJ_Photik: Doesn't match making set it straight eventually @hannah2125
[3:25:41] an_lyze: @lewhitehd69 I mean we HAVE snow right now LOL but like last week everything melted. Only like 3-4 cm right now. Hoping to do some gaming on Saturday!
[3:25:42] bloodinesser: kayle solo'd a set lvl 1, then a malph lvl 1 and a yone went 23/8
[3:25:43] hannah2125: @Bunnieees hello, i hope you're doing well too <3
[3:25:54] PropagandaMonkey: after playing a bit on EUW, how is soloq different to NA ? @kaypea
[3:25:55] shedfirekid1: that lucians awareness lmao
[3:25:56] DragoonRed: You are famous they must know you are a streamer :D MUST ALWAYS KILL STREAMER
[3:26:10] steelxdawn: KILL THE STREAMER is tradition
[3:26:48] lewhitehd69: @an_lyze oh i have heard of this 'gaming' before kaypCreep

[3:28:25] Martybggg: wait he can go through your wall while ulted?
[3:28:26] hannah2125: @photikx likely at some point, but even a couple of games with smurfs can be a turn off for new players
[3:28:30] Post_Maclone: Adidas
[3:28:40] an_lyze: @lewhitehd69 kaypAwkward
[3:28:54] DJ_Photik: True
