[5:52:06] Nick3570: did Asol get hotfixed yet
[5:52:08] laartist: its also true that in pro play they are way better at peeling for squishies so the assassins can't do much
[5:52:46] awa0904: maybe not now but back in the day zed had less counter play than akali does now
[5:53:00] awa0904: idk maybe champ is too hard

[5:55:32] Baturaya: those dogs look like they're part of another game
[5:55:45] supermoonyellow: the Q2 heals

[5:56:31] Nick3570: cuz this dog is bullshit
[5:56:34] Kenwood502: its worth killing his dogs if you can the respawn is like 15-20s per dog

[6:51:33] Tyblue72: GalaxyUnpacked
[6:51:53] PsychGamingMD: @Shrimpanzie  i would agree but i feel like this particular situation where they have so much MR makes the extra pen more important maybe?
[6:52:16] Shrimpanzie: @PsychGamingMD well thing is a lot of ap items do have magic pen on them, its just void is more %.
[6:52:17] Senzeeh: chat is this a youtube vid game
[6:52:32] PsychGamingMD: thats what i mean, like higher mr means % pen more value right?
[6:52:46] aerychan: isnt bloom just worse than voidstaff though, is the healing really gunna make a huge difference?
[6:52:57] Shrimpanzie: maybe but i think healing haste is nicer.
[6:53:04] Tyblue72: @senzeeh he’s said he’s playing bad so prolly not
[6:53:06] boxclocks: @Senzeeh unfortunately, i don't think so
[6:53:07] Tyblue72: LUL

[6:54:01] Tyblue72: Burger King bro GoldPLZ
[6:54:01] Vayneisme: You need shadowflame and rabadon
[6:54:15] jayinthi: would you think deathcap 3rd item more viable?
[6:54:21] Nick3570: senna is disgustingly broken
[6:54:23] electric_reflex: you need a bigger AD threat so they have to go armor Sadge
