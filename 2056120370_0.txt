[1:09:51] dalfaro90: I think nidalee is bad, why play her?.
[1:09:58] InnoSangLoL: You always try to hit long range because more DMG but the real play is too hit close range, it's psychology

[1:34:31] Sp0nks: Wait what RS youtuber uploads daily?
[1:34:34] pixelpantsu: who watches u play while eating breakfest 3KEKW
[1:34:37] 5mokess: I prefer less edits tbh
[1:34:42] BetaCarotene: My favorite YouTubers typically upload daily
[1:34:51] 5mokess: for league that is
[1:34:57] sncwy_g: maybe u can try uploading daily lower quality, and if the editors can manage they can put in extra time into a high qual vid like once a week
[1:34:59] idontdothismuch: Lower quality, higher frequency -- I honestly find more edits don't help a ton we're here for CONTENT
[1:35:02] kurisugowastaken: Wait what!? THAT WAS HIGH QUALITY VID? A to Z was high quality, that would be a lower one every day, the Smolder one. @Nightblue3

[1:35:59] Loquato: the every day will probably work better for you, im sure your community will consume most any video you produce
[1:36:00] padrawings: I would prefer stream focus and high quality tubes every 2 weeks @nightblue3
