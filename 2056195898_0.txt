[5:15:27] MissingMatter: Yeah, go fight the support in the enemy jungle and if you're lucky nobody else will come.
[5:15:53] MissingMatter: But if someone does come, Zac will make sure you know about it after you die.
[5:19:30] itkovian1: His brain blew up
[5:20:19] DarnRabbit: Diamond players today. 0 brain Kappa
[5:20:43] MissingMatter: Zac can't fight as a team. It's too hard to complain about your mistakes if he's there to tank.
[5:23:59] MissingMatter: I really thought he was just going to let you die.
[5:24:11] DarnRabbit: main character syndrome
[5:24:13] Rgcommander: he has a severe case of the dumb
[5:24:24] DarnRabbit: combined with 2 brain cells
[5:24:24] itkovian1: kinda want someone to take a shutdown to watch his ego explode

[5:38:06] MissingMatter: Why are you so bad that you would let any teammate die ever?
[5:38:15] GildedTuna: Kog couldnt help but take it across the face, its his nature
[5:38:21] GildedTuna: Utilizing passive

[5:51:27] MissingMatter: Last game's Zac could've happily called you "first time Belveth" instead of Kindred, but the poor bastard didn't get to come along for this one.
[5:52:32] MissingMatter: I dunno anything about Belveth. I've heard it's basically "new Master Yi but with void pregnancy"

[5:58:52] wilsonao: RUN IT BACK BOYS
[5:59:08] LlgerZer0: I have to go to bed but I believe in you you can do it run it back
[5:59:13] medisinskapet: i think you should q more while clearing
[5:59:19] DarkRedux: ^
