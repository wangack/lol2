[1:54:57] Moobot: Reminder: No backseating unless asked by the streamer himself.
[1:55:22] kingsableye: User Settings (next to deafen button) -> Voice & Video Tab -> scroll down ~80% of the way down to Attenuation slider bar, slide that down all the way left

[1:57:41] PoorMansPoison: 115, respectable
[1:57:49] CompulsiveOne: is your push to talk also the pause on your spotify?
[1:57:51] kingsableye: Looking it up o7
[1:58:08] Fr0stWulf: the official discord thing pretty much says to go fuck yourself
[1:58:10] SuperTurtle24: Spotify do it to try and stop bots from using them
[1:58:15] SuperTurtle24: Its fucking dumb
[1:58:15] Fr0stWulf: and just use push to talk
[1:58:19] SuperTurtle24: But you cant stop it sadly

[1:58:44] kingsableye: Chat if you don't know don't comment; Lawlman I've figured it out based on 2 videos and an article
[1:58:45] SuperTurtle24: I disconnected my spotify cus of it
[1:58:57] Rejnols: just listen to music inside your head, easy solution
[1:59:26] kingsableye: It's because your Spotify is connected to Discord, apparently, there's not a "fix" for it besides disconnecting it from your Discord
[1:59:52] Fr0stWulf: oh yeah i didnt reallu consider that a fix cuz he said he didnt want to disconnect it Shruge
[2:00:02] Broke99: Mine doesn't do that and mines connected

[2:00:31] SnailintheShell: Discord is a great piece of software that never makes questionable feature choices. lawlmanSmile
[2:00:38] Broke99: maybe disconnect and reconnect it? Mine doesn't do that
[2:00:42] Oglino: PoorMansPoison byeee peepoHey
[2:00:50] kingsableye: Yeah, there's actually a reason to have it connected; I'm looking more because some people don't have that issue, like Broke
[2:01:04] Shmartee: Did we already try turning off Automatically Detect Audio Input Device?
[2:01:04] Moobot: I'm sorry, but Queen is currently unavailable to accept your call. Please leave a voicemail after the tone or hang up and dial again...*beep*
[2:01:15] Shmartee: This site also recommends using a different audio output for Discord and Spotify
[2:01:47] Shmartee: Those are suggestions for fixing the issue from a website, I can't confirm/deny
[2:02:04] kingsableye: That's a little convoluted, and the issue seems to be because you're speaking for a period of time, not necessarily over-channeled audio
[2:02:30] AzamaraSehki: ded
[2:02:37] christmas4477: ded

[2:03:39] zinkmanne: everything else in her kit would be poopoo tho right?
[2:03:41] Rejnols: I suppose the issue with on hit is based on the rest of her abilities being better off with straight ad/lethality
[2:04:28] Broke99: It might work
[2:04:37] christmas4477: Everything is possible in aram
[2:04:46] Rejnols: Good old days when you went lethality AS lucian to shoot 512 shots with R
[2:04:48] zaleves: "You wouldn't actually run it" says the man that has run Bluecian
[2:05:47] kingsableye: I did some more digging and sadly what I said is correct. Discord does this to stop you from streaming the Spotify music through your mic; so if your mic is on for ~30 seconds it pauses Spotify
[2:05:47] Moobot: Lawlman has a nice little discord for hanging out, chatting, and posting media. Check it out here! https://discord.gg/y85UEHq

[2:28:03] TyrannessBelial: they specifically prevent that
[2:28:04] TheMadBadger: didn't they just buff Shaco so the clone does your ability animations too?
[2:28:14] fluffypandaa214: is there an easy way to tell the fake or is it just reading movement

[2:29:34] WampyWomp: loool
[2:29:35] kingsableye: The Malignance Synergy that feels the worst on ARAM is Teemo Shrrom Malignance
[2:29:41] isyourTVrunning: dazeClown
[2:29:41] kingsableye: That feels so bad to play against
[2:29:49] WampyWomp: i just got out of a kahzix game where the rengar was 20/3

[2:31:02] WampyWomp: it taste like chicken
[2:31:10] Oglino: NOOO THE PENTA
[2:31:12] kingsableye: @TheMadBadger Having to wait for cannon minions is terrible, especially when the enemy team can delete them in 0.2 seconds (and Teem can with an auto and a shroom)
[2:31:17] Broke99: ROBBED OF MY PENTA

[2:41:26] marquisecat: why does anyone ever bring clarity. feels like such a waste
[2:41:26] Moobot: Roc is here for two things and two things only. Your channel points, and soul.
[2:43:11] DarkDeskes: honestly hwei's QE needs a much higher mana cost. Its so good and so spammable
[2:43:11] Moobot: Check out Lawlman's twitter for stream notifications and more! https://twitter.com/Mrlawlman1
[2:43:37] gavriel_: ngl i havnt seen any gameplay of this champ but like
[2:43:39] Grognog: It also helps poke champs get an early advantage, which can make or break a lot of aram games
[2:43:43] gavriel_: pretty wicked
[2:44:14] gavriel_: taric GIGACHAD
[2:44:20] DarkDeskes: in general his mana cost should be much higher, since his WE(I think?) gives mana back on auto's. His mana sustain is waaaay too good
[2:44:33] futuresight23: Don't let that distract you from the fact that Twitch was hiding though.  Kappa
[2:44:40] Aster_Op: lets give a mage 9 spells Clueless

[2:55:45] TheMadBadger: That was a cool play
[2:55:56] Troggador: people used to host custom games on summoners rift and expect you to follow the rules before it officially came out
[2:56:29] isyourTVrunning: Doc you took an oath to DO NO HARM
[2:56:29] LephrinSolus: time to pivot to adc hwei Kappa
[2:56:39] Doctor_Richie: @isyourTVrunning lawlmanGasp Youre right
[2:56:49] kingsableye: How debuffed is he?
[2:57:08] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: MR is so easy to build now, and Magic Pen is so hard to stack. The moment champs go for MR it just eliminates ap champs
[2:57:22] TheMadBadger: @pippinpaddleopsicopoles Rookern was a mistake
[2:57:52] pippinpaddleopsicopoles: @TheMadBadger Agreed. Maybe last season when Rocketbelt mythic was a thing it could have been balanced? But now its so fucking op
[2:57:52] TheMadBadger: Rookern plus spirit visage

[2:58:24] kingsableye: What
[2:58:25] pvt_Davids: thats why is early and late champ is a term i guess Shruge
[2:58:38] kingsableye: kingsableye gifted a Tier 1 sub to BedBanana! They have given 70 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:58:43] BedBanana: @kingsableye Thanks for the gift sub!
