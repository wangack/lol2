[4:30:20] daemunblaze: @bossthelevel you got it backwards planets are named after Roman Gods
[4:30:25] Derp_sanity: @FarmerFigs as a jungle main in moderate elo i can confirm we are all this way
[4:30:26] bossthelevel: I tbh, think Egyptians had their early mythology more on poiny
[4:30:29] zafironius: @Madrai i mean mobis were literally greek sandals in old and i guess new art also
[4:30:44] oksusu99: UDYR FLASH
[4:30:44] bossthelevel: @daemunblaze I meant Romans name after planets,
[4:30:47] Techno9986: Maldzahar
[4:30:48] ZoeDplayer: its okay malz got it does not matter xdd
[4:30:48] TorqueBandit: Does Tabis mean anything
[4:30:49] oksusu99: YEET
[4:30:50] madmilk___: malzh is op howd he get through pick bans

[4:31:14] CoolVideoGamer69: 3:20 would be fast, that one was normal
[4:31:15] Derp_sanity: imagine getting first blooded by malzahar pre 6 NeverLucky
[4:31:23] honeymustard91: @moose3knuckle nid can always be relevant in soloq, yes she falls off but most non tank junglers do so by that logic there’s no point to play anything except sej rell maokai udyr etc.
[4:31:27] bossthelevel: Hades vrs Pluto?
[4:31:57] ManReforged: Udyr can finish full clear at 3:15 easily if he get a decent leash
[4:31:57] kirigr81: @kroggtmm thats where u can prime sub on ur phone
[4:31:59] honeymustard91: @moose3knuckle also, most soloq games are decided within 15 minutes so it doesn’t matter all that much that nid can’t team fight
[4:32:02] moosE3knucklE: @honeymustard91 yeah and thats my whole point. who cares if something isnt the best. cause if u only play the best.. ur playing the same things
[4:32:09] daemunblaze: @bossthelevel reverse it though.  We named planets after the Roman gods.  As the knowledge of planets outside of  Earth postdates the gods.
[4:32:15] bossthelevel: What's funny, is at the time Romans vrs greek, the Romans were trying to label the.planets as their gods
[4:32:26] Wrothgarr: why Q max here?
[4:32:30] gleachmoney: Chatting
[4:32:32] bossthelevel: Vrs greek taking the same spread sheet, And making diff names
[4:32:33] CamR6: monkaS
[4:32:43] bossthelevel: I played a lot of god of war games
[4:32:45] Derp_sanity: @Wrothgarr compete with malz shove

[4:32:58] TorqueBandit: Malz crabs give you quite a bit of gold over time
[4:32:58] インヂジォンズ: udyr a fan of the stream
[4:33:20] bossthelevel: @daemunblaze realistically, that's why there's this whole buffer about Muhammad vrs Jesus too.
[4:33:22] kirigr81: @bossthelevel wasnt the greek myth before the Romans ?
[4:33:25] Wrothgarr: @Derp_sanity makes sense
[4:33:28] bossthelevel: Very slight translations
[4:33:32] madmilk___: is picking wukong jungle reportable ?

[4:34:13] bossthelevel: @kibut yeah green were first, Romans took Greek, and adopted Christianity
[4:34:14] DonEpic: damn

[4:35:04] Roozick: weirdCorn
[4:35:05] Techno9986: why didnt they go for you?
[4:35:08] bossthelevel: The roman empire had these high elite people,.And decided to jump on boards with this new Christian thing
[4:35:31] bossthelevel: Because very easy to subjected a bunch of pissed of people
[4:35:34] BigYangTheory: jg weak
[4:35:39] daemunblaze: @bossthelevel the Roman vrs Greek stems from the fact that All the Romans did was take the Greek gods and adapt them and then add various other deities to the pantheon later...but Mythology is an ever evolving culture of its own.
[4:35:39] ManReforged: jungle diff again xdd

[4:37:42] Roozick: CluegiChungus
[4:37:45] daemunblaze: @bossthelevel it makes sense.  In order to spread your believes you don't conquer a land and then force them to adapt to the new.  You adapt what you have to what they had to make conversion easier.

[4:58:54] bossthelevel: Taric op af rn too, btw
[4:59:01] FinkleTheMage: @bossthelevel When did you start playing league? These kinds of details will be important when writing the biography of your league experiences.
[4:59:05] bossthelevel: For you sup mains out there
[4:59:22] bossthelevel: @finklethemage I started league when illaoi was a new champ
[4:59:36] bossthelevel: I'm new, but my friends brought me over from dota
[4:59:45] Koawaaa: brand got nerf this patch lol
[4:59:51] FinkleTheMage: @bossthelevel Ahhhh I see I see. New to the game, but just so full of knowledge!
[4:59:53] FuwafuwaYui: essaying
[4:59:57] bossthelevel: Simply because they all played league, I wanna be cool, didn't wanna be the only dota player
[5:00:00] ebb11: brand is having fun
[5:00:05] Hardrocklife: supporting his jungler?
[5:00:11] moosE3knucklE: @koawaaa 3 second slower clear speed. lol
[5:00:19] Koawaaa: yup
[5:00:33] Koawaaa: they nerf his passive hard
[5:00:35] fruitflavoredsnack: @bossthelevel how was the swap from dota for u
[5:00:45] bossthelevel: I swear, on my life, if league added minion execute like dota? The meta game oromplay scene would be Bonkers INSANE
[5:00:46] FinkleTheMage: @fruitflavoredsnack That's the spirit!
[5:00:59] bossthelevel: @fruitflavoredsnack actually super easy, dota is a lot harder
[5:01:00] deamless12: do it BigBrother
[5:01:18] bossthelevel: The dota games last on average 39-60 mins
[5:01:26] fruitflavoredsnack: @bossthelevel interesting, only moba ive ever tried is league
[5:01:37] bossthelevel: League, you can close a game if you have a lead and know what your doing, 20 mins
[5:01:41] possible12345: possible12345 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:01:57] TorqueBandit: 12345
[5:02:00] Based________: is this akali more op then pre rework akali?

[5:02:15] TorqueBandit: 69 69 69 69
[5:02:32] bossthelevel: @fruitflavoredsnack I bring up the denying aspect from dota specifically. In dota, the enemy can deny you gold and xp, by smiting your own lane minions.
[5:02:32] albfrontiersman: XD
[5:02:34] FinkleTheMage: @bossthelevel 5head player. Where were you born at?
[5:02:38] bossthelevel: That is a huge mechanic

[5:03:15] bossthelevel: So, you be draven here. You slap lane yeah? You as draven, legit constantly deny xp, by denying the minions
[5:03:15] Khronekeo: lonely top lane
[5:03:17] trealo94: laning phase > missing pantry item
[5:03:18] cr3p0: tell if how it is boss MrDestructoid <3 pobPonyocheer
[5:03:20] mrslumped: how did wukong go?
[5:03:27] Gendral: akali in lane Bedge
[5:03:32] Mitch97x: shut up bel veth XD
[5:03:45] bossthelevel: I feel like if league is already a copy of dota, why not just add minion denying? That would make these draven Lanes also akali lanes, so much more interesting
[5:03:55] sneaxOG: @bossthelevel bro we know how dota works this is a league stream tho Hmm
[5:04:17] bossthelevel: @sneaxog I'm not talking to you, I'm answering questions from other in chat, mkay

[5:04:50] sneaxOG: @bossthelevel dont need to be pissed of those wasnt meant to be rude
[5:05:09] deamless12: ok now shut up about dota
[5:05:15] bossthelevel: @sneaxog I'm on mobile, and twitch definitely needs to dev this shit better. It is literally cancer for me as a mobile viewer, to make clips
[5:05:21] Mushroommeister: toplane
[5:05:22] advancie: stale piss is wild
[5:05:36] TorqueBandit: stale piss isnt as bad as people make it seem
[5:05:38] bossthelevel: My mains complaining with mobile twitch experience
[5:05:45] Flygone3: time to turn off chat methinks
[5:05:54] TorqueBandit: LUL
[5:05:57] FinkleTheMage: @インヂジォンズ You don't know me, and I haven't ever soapboxed in Pobs chat... I am however being a sarcastic prick and it's going much further than I'd ever imagined possible lol

[5:07:17] ogoaxe: :D
[5:07:18] FinkleTheMage: @Envelaap you know what they say... bigger Q hitbox..... bigger...
[5:07:28] Envelaap: @FinkleTheMage so true....
[5:07:30] bossthelevel: @envelaap every play team fortress 2? Same idea with how come enemy pyro players always hit you, but your pyros never hit

[5:11:11] bossthelevel: I felt so hard the other day when Pob's said, "I feel like it's a waste of time to play new games, when I'm so invested in this games spaghetti code, and it's hard to detach from it" Pobelter - 2025
[5:11:12] TorqueBandit: if we're being honest, League client is the most broken thing in the game.
[5:11:21] burne114: Pobs team did 9-11 Sadge
