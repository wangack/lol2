[0:30:44] hewhocomz: congaleseshaftseller subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! i feel like they could have done alot with smolder maybe a mechanic that makes him grow older with the number of stacks he has and changes his abilities accordingly but that requires effort
[0:30:46] llyJavi: llyJavi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[0:30:48] Tallitch: doublelift is streaming smolder right now. go critique him

[0:57:27] trunnpet: i want to suck his rod
[0:57:28] 510irv: bunch of pick me’s 😂😂
[0:57:28] conkerzone: do you want an active on the item?
[0:57:32] i_HooX: oh yeah that wont be broken
[0:57:38] AegonHD: an item that makes you completely invul if you get a kill :)
[0:57:40] saikysantos: @multoohhmni true
[0:57:43] fighting_fafnir: imagine glimmer cape in league lol
[0:57:43] pallasfr: bring back zz'rot
[0:57:47] AntonyTLK1: pugPls

[0:57:53] Epsilon_Dogg: is this Rayquaza?
[0:57:54] spacialflow_: so how Mejai’s should be lol
[0:58:05] Senyuno: Sir that rod is needlessly large
[0:58:05] bipolar_bearclaw: @aegonhd radical idea, v original, bravo!
[0:58:05] LilyMichaelShip_: honestly a double spell item could be cool
[0:58:13] LilyMichaelShip_: it's active casts the last non ult spell you cast
[0:58:14] Skitter70: vigar building vigar passive item
[0:58:20] Nightbot: Socials: Youtube: www.youtube.com/PekinWoof Twitter: www.Twitter.com/PekinWoof Discord: https://discord.gg/6KXvJtY
[0:58:22] AegonHD: thank you, it also makes you deal more damage to squishies
[0:58:25] AntonyTLK1: @lilymichaelship_ Seraphine passive Aware
[0:58:29] EmperorLOGiK: I think items that both buff and nerf different stats would be good, like a tank item that gives huge armour but slows movement or an item that increases area of ability but reduces damage just for min/max options
[0:58:30] pallasfr: what about a navori for mages
[0:58:30] LilyMichaelShip_: kinda yeah
[0:58:34] shintoaliengod: what about an actual anti shield AP item
[0:58:37] shintoaliengod: that would be nice
[0:58:39] luxanna_2k: when i had a baby and he was so big, he took up too much of my belly space and my bladder
[0:58:40] bertongay: hii bekin
[0:58:46] LilyMichaelShip_: lux we already heard sajj
[0:58:47] AntonyTLK1: uuh lux
[0:58:49] AegonHD: oh boy here we go
[0:58:53] AntonyTLK1: o7 lix
[0:58:56] saikysantos: I have an idea: An AP Item that gives you a chain lighting when u hit someone and slows them
[0:58:56] luxanna_2k: He was in fact put pressure on my bladder
[0:59:03] luxanna_2k: @LilyMichaelShip_ catShh
[0:59:04] GuestofChaos: I wanna see nick play asol with the changes too i wonder how he does with them
[0:59:04] Nightbot: Use !queue for the name of the queue game.
[0:59:07] LilyMichaelShip_: we was in fact put pressure Chatting
[0:59:08] saikysantos: and the chain lighting deals dmg
[0:59:08] pixelgel: @EmperorLOGiK they avoid things like that because then they have to tune them to only be good on champs where it's OP, e.g. a slowing item on a champ that can be immune to slows
[0:59:14] NadiaBusiness: when i had a baby and he was so big, he took up too much of my belly space and my bladder
[0:59:18] LilyMichaelShip_: @LilyMichaelShip_ catshus

[0:59:38] lordplones: Hi Pekin Hi chat
[0:59:39] BubbliestAsschaps: What if there was an item that casts 2 of your spell but has reduced dmg? Like 40% reduced dmg

[1:00:33] AntonyTLK1: After that i will gn
[1:00:34] EmperorLOGiK: @pixelgel the debuffs would need to be as persistent as the buffs and ignore any character specifics, and ignore any abilities that cancel debuffs but yes it could completely break some champs
[1:00:44] LilyMichaelShip_: surel
[1:00:46] couchpotatoeater: Hello pekin, hello boys

[1:01:19] pixelgel: i think that would be dificult to do in a way that feels at all consistent, would seem like items break champ abilities even if they don't

[3:30:43] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting

That is by far the hottest Cyber sportsman to ever grace the esports industry. I'd let him beast his way through my mid any day.

[5:38:11] Oreganeaux: I heard Fappy has a giant fappy
[5:38:19] AntonyTLK1: blehhhhhhhhhh that baron
[5:38:20] beffsupreem: Hwei missed an asol that was flying in a straight line at him
