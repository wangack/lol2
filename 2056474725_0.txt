[1:41:47] azael: which makes sense to me
[1:41:50] noctroewich: Sundering sky for sure
[1:41:55] Lourlo: Lourlo gifted a Tier 1 sub to Anndyys! 
[1:41:57] lolMaggs: I think Eclipse and Sundered sounds good

[1:43:24] Couwcouw: @ShakeandbakeAK hes just using lourlo as a lab rat keking
[1:43:33] azael: more q's = more ghouls + more e's and his lane is almost always about hitting e
[1:43:34] Loquial: wait why lethality
[1:43:38] ShakeandbakeAK: good @Couwcouw  keking
[1:43:40] ZyrusVallien: Azael can you use your Riot powers to nerf Yorick again xDDD
