[1:01:22] cbhl: I like using puff pastry scraps to make a pseudo chicken-pot-pie
[1:01:39] cbhl: you just put pot pie filling in a casserole dish and then just put biscuits or bits of puff pastry as a "pie top"
[1:01:55] cbhl: peepoClap
[1:02:02] sydwicky: is this part of the rice cake or this is a separate dish?

[1:36:36] Thia_Fon: what is tang yuan?
[1:36:44] cbhl: @fluffytape I think it depends on the SO. Some people like being asked because it makes them feel valued / not taken for granted; others don't like being asked because it can demonstrate insecurity when you want security
