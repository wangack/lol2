[0:54:29] sennabon_: i eman smolder just came out there is no way they dont play someone else
[0:54:49] Gunstar_Hero: Hello Sally, did you make the 7om meeting? lol
[0:54:56] Project_Ashe_NA: there should be a 2 week period where new champs should be disabled in ranked queues UNLESS the player has mastery 7 on it
[0:55:27] kingdurrrrrrr: imaqtpie smolders is pretty good
[0:55:39] Project_Ashe_NA: you're LPP, go tell riot about it LMAFO @yougelly
[0:55:39] Topcatrs88: @Project_Ashe_NA Maybe the mastery level should be based on the players rank
[0:55:50] sennabon_: alan found a new build on him
[0:55:51] katinent: but his other champs are better asmoEz
[0:56:03] Tatsuooo1: fast learner you mean
[0:56:04] Project_Ashe_NA: @Topcatrs88 no, if u have mastery 7, you're decently comfortable on the champion mechanically
[0:56:38] Chococlaw: the problem is they do it, would be too little data for the champ in game, and riot would have problem  whit buff/nerf for more time that now
[0:57:16] Project_Ashe_NA: they can look at data from the other queues, there's no problem
[0:57:57] katinent: KEKW
[0:58:00] cars0n727: KEKW
[0:58:00] heyhellos: Pog
[0:58:10] Project_Ashe_NA: NAHHHHHHH AINTNOWAY NOT AFTER U JUST SAID ALL THAT
[0:58:11] JMSavior: plus balancing the champ shouldn't be a SPRINT. they can have the same balancing philosophy with a "slower" pool of data is fine
[0:58:14] HypnosTheHero: LMAOOOO DISNEY DRAGON
[0:58:15] kingdurrrrrrr: karma
[0:58:17] HypnosTheHero: I LOVE IT
[0:58:18] Topcatrs88: @Project_Ashe_NA but in lower ranks it doesn't matter, most people aren't even comfortable on the champions they play or don't know how to play their champs so it works
[0:58:20] cars0n727: AINTNOWAY
[0:58:21] PikachuTheCat: hover smolder
[0:58:25] supermoonyellow: the 180 OMEGALUL
[0:58:28] heyhellos: KEKW
[0:58:28] JMSavior: if anything, making people play norms BEFORE ranked means the ranked data pools mean more
