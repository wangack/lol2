[0:11:38] opmechanics2112: oh have u been takin both sundered and tri?
[0:11:51] teebone33: But people are saying full bruiser is where its at
[0:12:47] opmechanics2112: i mean that sounds good to me lol
[0:12:50] mikmik009: Profane hydra
[0:12:53] MoonshadeRequiem: So who is laughing at the Aurelion changes? Riot nerfed his W so it was worse than pre-patch
[0:13:04] teebone33: ya and Sundered Sky. Sky healing + Q jhealing is real good
[0:13:05] opmechanics2112: build some hp and get titanic
[0:13:22] JUST_ODINN: i cant do it man i have been so fed my last few games but 1 i cant end and my team wont stop feedig
[0:13:27] minniethesooh: can you hover over q real quick
[0:13:27] opmechanics2112: so lemme think then....

[0:13:40] Techno9986: what did they buff on yorick?
[0:14:06] teebone33: Ya Riot wants yorick to be a bad nasus so they push him towards bruiser lol
[0:14:30] ArcticNitsua: @Techno9986 i think he heals more off q now
[0:14:57] teebone33: His Q heals more, and his E cast is waaay faster which is the best part
[0:14:58] opmechanics2112: triforce, sundered, spirit visage, heartsteel, swifties, titanic hydra.... i guess youd have to build heartsteel first
[0:15:13] opmechanics2112: or trade out heartsteel for hull
[0:15:18] opmechanics2112: yea hull better

[1:34:07] ZeroTheGame: @darkstarr222 much appreciation to the game designers, but sometimes I think they get carried away with the patches
[1:34:11] darkstarr222: excessive imo
[1:34:45] cheeseballBrad: Riot got sick of hearing T1 whine so they buffed the hell out of her
[1:34:52] darkstarr222: lmao
[1:35:03] TadpoIeBro: dirty vayne top player
[1:35:10] darkstarr222: i honestly dont think riot gives af what tyler says

[1:36:10] darkstarr222: @Masakah i dont think they buffed the range of that.. but idk for sure
[1:36:28] teebone33: Ya matchup is butts
[1:36:50] darkstarr222: @cheeseballBrad but according to him.. they nerfed all his champs at the same time
[1:36:57] Peac3d: Just hit her with your W first Kappa
[1:37:16] darkstarr222: i honestly think he just gets a lot of trolls in his games when he streams
[1:37:25] cheeseballBrad: That's probably just unlucky
[1:37:26] darkstarr222: so all his champs feel bad cause his team be trolling him
[1:37:35] TadpoIeBro: vayne should get a -50% movespeed debuff if she is on the top side of the map
[1:37:35] ZeroTheGame: i've never gone swifties on yorick. must be good with the new update
[1:37:41] cheeseballBrad: It does seem that way for sure dude.
[1:37:52] darkstarr222: @TadpoIeBro and 0 health regen
[1:38:39] zcar1980: try w  first
[1:38:46] darkstarr222: i played against three yoricks today
[1:38:54] teebone33: With the E speed increase, you can definitely hit. Its hard but doable
[1:38:58] ZeroTheGame: fleet footwork would have been better here, i think

[9:44:40] KyleKyleArgyle: Do you still go Q first on AP nasus?
[9:44:51] r3nt0n7: nah, E for wave clear / lane prio @KyleKyleArgyle
[9:45:06] KyleKyleArgyle: @r3 rad thanks!

[9:49:05] susanpharaoh: AP is definitely fun. But AD still carries better overall. There are some matchups where you should never go E max. kayle for example.
[9:50:21] Junkee27: @susanpharaoh you got kayle concerns? you bad
[9:51:30] susanpharaoh: But what if your team messes up once? She gets to scale. You get owned once she is 16. You max Q you pretty much 1v9. Atleast to my experience.
[9:51:42] r3nt0n7: @Junkee27 yeah you must be challenger then
[9:51:59] RileyJamesBrown: Fight fight fight Kappa
[9:52:13] ElementalGt: Chris we giga chadding i see

[9:52:18] ElementalGt: LUL LUL LUL
[9:52:20] susanpharaoh: You can stack 500 @ 20 mins in kayle lane. Why let that go for E max? I dont understand that.
[9:52:57] ElementalGt: @susanpharaoh the magician never reveals his secrets
[9:53:00] Junkee27: @r3nt0n7 dont have to be challenger to recognize garbo champ like kayle
[9:53:01] ElementalGt: Kappa
[9:53:03] KoS_Bunnyslippers: does smolder have the execute stacks?
[9:53:29] r3nt0n7: ya you could see the elder buff pop up on someone in that fight @KoS_Bunnyslippers
[9:53:51] KoS_Bunnyslippers: r3nt0n7 interesting that teammates see smolder execute but don't see like cho r execute or pyke r execute
[9:54:26] KoS_Bunnyslippers: susanpharaoh ap nasus still lets you stack q's though so you get both
[9:54:33] susanpharaoh: Agreed!
[9:54:42] giuxXD: @KoS_Bunnyslippers probably coded same as elder dragon exec
[9:54:56] KoS_Bunnyslippers: giuxXD good point probably didn't recreate the wheel with it
[9:55:00] ShroudedGaming: I mean if you had 20k stacks you could 1 shot towers. So breakign teh gates would be pretty ez
[9:55:06] 三合一磁怪: rigged
[9:55:29] susanpharaoh: Yes. But not as much. I just dont understand why you would do it on a lane that is already free. Unless you are playing against a team that Hella kites you like Chris says.
[9:56:06] KoS_Bunnyslippers: @三合一磁怪 when i google translate your name it says "3-in-1 Magnemite"
[9:56:21] r3nt0n7: Susan, A: sometimes you enjoy one playstyle more over the other, B: sometimes your team needs AP damage, C: opportunity cost -- you may give up some stacks to deny kayle farm/xp
[9:56:27] ShroudedGaming: wicked ad timing
[9:57:11] 三合一磁怪: @KoS_Bunnyslippers Not technically wrong, my name is magneton in traditional chinese
[9:57:27] susanpharaoh: Yea, im not a fan of betting on that denying farm with the way people throw leads from plat to Diamond. But that might just be my low elo thing. xD
