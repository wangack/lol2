[1:21:25] EmperorSadge: Its not even suprising that the strongest Smolder build is tank/AP xD
[1:21:30] heaven_trampler: 4k stacks = 100% execute

[1:24:43] gulle1337: ´have you platyed zeri yet
[1:24:50] EmperorSadge: @scooterxoxo Liandry + Riftmaker has an interaction where it counts you as in combat. 2ndly Liandry's always scales nicely with any type of execute as it let's burn down the treshold

[1:57:56] mingeeatingdisorder: @sandcrema i think it was boots, shojin, rift, liandrys, iceborn
[1:57:58] greeniris_: i don't think Samira knows she can W your ult
[1:58:10] ejoheera: when are u playing smolder on lvp???

[1:58:15] MokuwuYo: maokai said "sorry for inting"
[1:58:17] Dr_Zombie90210: reminds me of old ez build with frozen fist
[1:58:21] Lvcca_: how is the full build on that?
[1:58:27] MokuwuYo: @greeniris_ she did two times tho
[1:58:28] Nikushaa: jesus I just realized that shojin gives 35 ability haste
[1:58:50] john57n: Wait for all the champs that can go both bloodthirster>shieldbow?
[1:58:52] Kinteshi: also being tanky means you deal less dmg means you can stack more Pog @Jackspektra
[1:59:21] aboveskg: lucian?
[1:59:25] Nikushaa: lowkey you are also be able to go cleaver instead of shojin, not sure if it's ever worth tho
[1:59:46] aboveskg: is stormrazor voltanic good on lucian u think mr chef? @Jackspektra
[2:00:02] Tempest_72: smolder has too much mixed dmg for cleaver to be good i feel
[2:00:05] Nikushaa: ill check
[2:00:28] Lvcca_: shojin fits perfect on him
[2:00:41] tedyedd: cleaver only procs on physical dmg
[2:00:43] Tempest_72: prob not since cleaver only procs from physical dmg

[2:02:20] thechildofnight: why do you think some players struggle with smolder? are they playing fights too fast?
[2:02:25] thechildofnight: not stacking good enough?
[2:02:53] Nikushaa: ye cleaver gets procced a single time by each ability except E
[2:03:19] spentwalnut: dave

[2:04:37] mm_a_r_o: what is the best  damage build on smolder
[2:04:58] Nikushaa: 3k games is pretty reliable
[2:05:24] Samooooth: For sure it is good for the game that bruiser items deal exact same amount of damages than crit once, but with thousands more hps
[2:05:46] Nikushaa: but it might be biased by the fact that shojin might only be built by players who are good at smolder
[2:06:00] Nikushaa: u have tarzaned in ur team
[2:06:02] Nikushaa: xddd
[2:06:21] violcncc: oh god fast  mute
