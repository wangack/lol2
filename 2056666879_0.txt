[1:21:25] EmperorSadge: Its not even suprising that the strongest Smolder build is tank/AP xD
[1:21:30] heaven_trampler: 4k stacks = 100% execute

[1:24:50] EmperorSadge: @scooterxoxo Liandry + Riftmaker has an interaction where it counts you as in combat. 2ndly Liandry's always scales nicely with any type of execute as it let's burn down the treshold

[1:59:46] aboveskg: is stormrazor voltanic good on lucian u think mr chef? @Jackspektra
[2:00:02] Tempest_72: smolder has too much mixed dmg for cleaver to be good i feel
[2:00:05] Nikushaa: ill check
[2:00:28] Lvcca_: shojin fits perfect on him
[2:00:41] tedyedd: cleaver only procs on physical dmg
[2:00:43] Tempest_72: prob not since cleaver only procs from physical dmg

[2:04:58] Nikushaa: 3k games is pretty reliable
[2:05:24] Samooooth: For sure it is good for the game that bruiser items deal exact same amount of damages than crit once, but with thousands more hps
[2:05:46] Nikushaa: but it might be biased by the fact that shojin might only be built by players who are good at smolder
[2:06:00] Nikushaa: u have tarzaned in ur team
[2:06:02] Nikushaa: xddd
