[1:39:05] Cororonoa: lmao, int Sion is clearly back
[1:39:36] Kenwood502: not sure he ever left
[1:39:37] jobekta: BORK?
[1:39:58] AnUnknownGold: Teemo got nerfed ? LUL
[1:40:07] joolin: teemo is finally viable and they nerf him :(
[1:40:12] Cororonoa: Teemo got nerfed like 10 times
[1:40:20] Kenwood502: teemo R cd got nerfed ya
[1:40:20] Cororonoa: for the first time in 10 years
[1:40:39] xxpops: his shrooms got nerfed and his e, they reverted his e, then found q bug and fix that next patch
[1:41:04] 514484: sion doesn't know he needs to do that with minions KEKW
[1:41:16] mmarcon2k18: goes in goes out refuses to care
[1:41:18] docelover: @514484 it looks like it doesnt matter much lol
[1:42:37] Cororonoa: even Lux is recognizing the importance of BORK
[1:43:46] docelover: so satisfying to see this sion getting his loss LUL
[1:44:09] Cororonoa: well played
[1:44:19] 514484: thank god for that dog enemy bot
[1:44:39] 514484: game decided by who has the dogs, as usual
[1:44:44] Kenwood502: team just needed the right items
[1:45:01] Kenwood502: HOLY MF damage
[1:45:35] AnUnknownGold: For once Lethal tempo would have been good too against sion LUL
[1:45:57] mklarnecistka: lets go
[1:46:12] AnUnknownGold: where is heartseel teemo
[1:46:23] liranv123: 😍
[1:46:36] Kenwood502: Heartsteel teemo not as nice without demonic embrace :(
[1:48:38] 514484: i like it but it's not a tank item, it's a damage item for sion
[1:48:46] Kenwood502: yeah just meant the added AP scaling with HP
[1:48:52] Kenwood502: with demonic
[1:49:04] Kenwood502: was nice having double burn items
[1:49:56] PhilosoPhiddle: PhilosoPhiddle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! Is Senor iPav now officially a meta abuser like the rest of us?!?! Say it isn't so. I will now cry myself to sleep unless we get another Experimental Hexplate game.
[1:50:29] AnUnknownGold: I'm playing Swain with hearsteel rush and it's pretty nice as the heal is a % of HP, early it's pretty strong
[1:51:10] Kenwood502: Heartsteel swain hmmm
[1:51:24] Kenwood502: sounds interesting in aram
[1:51:27] AnUnknownGold: can you feel the bronze leeking out of my strats
[1:52:42] AnUnknownGold: @Kenwood502 I think it's nerfed in aram tho
[1:53:14] AnUnknownGold: phase rush is not good ?

[1:54:47] razer_mon: eat the axe
[1:54:50] razer_mon: we heal
[1:55:52] AnUnknownGold: not getting hit by the axe ipavNotes
[1:57:00] docelover: olaf is probably the most useless champion once it gets late game
[1:59:44] AnUnknownGold: you can cry
[2:00:07] xLeSeigneurBalekx: lvl sex ooolaf
[2:00:42] AnUnknownGold: EZ
[2:01:00] YolkBun: ipavEZ not even close
[2:01:04] 514484: with anything other than PTA or Phase Rush, you are dead
[2:01:30] YolkBun: ipavEZ worth
[2:01:46] Kenwood502: got the plate EZ clap
[2:01:48] RhyzeRhyze: olaf didn't get assist, worth
[2:03:43] Kenwood502: Olaf seems like a pain to play. His engage is so predictable
[2:04:57] RhyzeRhyze: you either hit your axe, or you don't engage I guess
[2:05:26] Kenwood502: yeah and Olaf just doesn't do well in 5v5 fights usually
[2:05:43] Kenwood502: with his kit unless he gets some crazy flank
[2:06:22] xLeSeigneurBalekx: no max w N
[2:06:24] xLeSeigneurBalekx: ?
[2:06:38] Kenwood502: Dyrus the only person I've seen pilot Olaf fairly well
[2:08:10] DontFeedPenguins: @Kenwood502 high elo right? his pretty good on my elo (plat)
[2:09:06] AnUnknownGold: that's a lot of money
[2:10:59] 514484: professionn Taimo PogBones
[2:11:03] AnUnknownGold: teemo 4ever
[2:11:33] RhyzeRhyze: douburuh furashi
[2:14:27] Kenwood502: @DontFeedPenguins idk what elo Dyrus is anymore he kinda gave up on league a while ago it seems
[2:15:05] Kenwood502: he used to be master tier though I believe when he did play some
[2:15:39] 514484: why does talon go Edge of Night? TF counters this with his ult
[2:17:12] Kenwood502: TIL that TF breaks edge of night and banshees that's a weird interaction
[2:18:15] purifish: lvl 1 on olaf LUL
[2:18:34] Kenwood502: Wait was he vs your teemo twice?
[2:18:39] Kenwood502: on two diff accounts
[2:18:48] Kenwood502: LUL
[2:19:08] DontFeedPenguins: thats a tilter
[2:19:26] Kenwood502: He's going to wake up tomorrow as a new TEEMO main
[2:20:25] 514484: unironically this is one of the reasons to play teemo, you never face shrooms
[2:20:59] Kenwood502: and teemo has some nice rune/build diversity
[2:26:22] RodNimrod: Speaking of, is the Q buff / QOL fix noticeable?
[2:27:59] RodNimrod: they changed how the blind works against attacks mid flight this patch
[2:29:08] RodNimrod: or maybe I'm reading it wrong
[2:30:04] 514484: yeah normals are getting unplayable, dogs enter games and they don't even want to play it out
[2:32:06] razer_mon: MONKAS Taimo ime
[2:33:02] bubblewins123: i mean if the support flash ks they may get tilted
[2:33:59] LtChezo: is this a personal attack mr ipav?
[2:34:15] razer_mon: why havent u played spyro yet mr Ipav??
[2:34:48] Toe_nails: tbf i understand playing it out in ranked with a turbo inting lane because u gain lp, in normals u gain nothing win or lose its just for fun
[2:34:59] razer_mon: Smolder = Spyro
[2:35:04] razer_mon: yes its a different game
[2:35:21] razer_mon: peepoSad
[2:35:22] 514484: teemo strim EZ
[2:35:30] DontFeedPenguins: SMOLDIER IS NOT SPYRO
[2:35:45] 514484: i agree, there is no difference
[2:35:45] DontFeedPenguins: Spyro is awesome Smodlier is not
[2:35:49] razer_mon: @DontFeedPenguins Shush
[2:36:14] 514484: LP is worthless but it makes players be dogs in normal and almsot forces you to play ranked because "muh normal"
[2:38:16] razer_mon: KEKL
[2:40:55] 514484: he should go ring even vs teemo i think
[2:41:59] LtChezo: kearnic rookern
[2:42:14] 514484: scenic booktern
[2:42:34] 514484: hannibal lectern

[2:47:39] razer_mon: KEKW
[2:47:46] razer_mon: THEY want taimo booty
[2:48:11] 514484: they suicide for teemo when they deal zero damage
[2:50:42] xLeSeigneurBalekx: i'm not like the others furrys
[2:50:44] lilchompero: I think he was watching Trick2g 😅

[2:55:04] 514484: he should have delayed liandori
[2:55:16] 514484: you can't do that vs taimo
[2:56:02] 514484: even boots were questionable, specter's cowl was the play
[2:56:05] xLeSeigneurBalekx: tbh udyr early has so many big shield
[2:56:30] xLeSeigneurBalekx: last time i faced udyr top i lost my mind with his shield and shuper shield and regen
[2:57:11] 514484: Kaenic or Spirit Visage EZ
[2:58:21] shpyzer: The way ure team dominated the game, made it looks like a bronze one

[3:01:21] AlanTeemo: are u happy playing ap or do u miss ad
[3:02:24] 514484: la league parte has acabado, ahora el señor va a meliorar su español
[3:03:17] AlanTeemo: I dont mind it that much
[3:03:31] AlanTeemo: you stop being able to kill in lane but killing in teamfights is doable
[3:06:30] LetTheScoutCook: they receive more dmg but they have more hp.. did test.. they witstand more pokes
[3:06:32] LetTheScoutCook: so idk
[3:06:46] LetTheScoutCook: hp > resist
[3:07:37] LetTheScoutCook: u sustain more poke dmg etc with hp.. i dont rly know why resist exist.. maybe vs vayne etc
[3:08:00] 514484: no, resists are more important
[3:09:06] 514484: play tank with HP items and then with resists, you'll notice the difference
[3:11:30] RafaCuglo: Zwag's been doing pretty well with teemo too
[3:11:57] RafaCuglo: zwagmo
[3:12:54] RafaCuglo: He's playing mostly for shrooms
[3:13:56] Afrhody: !runes
[3:14:14] Mirphys: oh shroomo build
[3:14:46] RafaCuglo: Ty G was coaching him on this matchup
[3:15:33] RafaCuglo: Not this match
[3:15:45] RafaCuglo: yep
[3:18:50] RafaCuglo: absolutely haha
[3:19:30] Mirphys: shroom build without malignance ?
[3:19:45] Afrhody: When should teemo not build nashor first item?
[3:20:02] Mirphys: o later on
[3:20:03] Mirphys: ok
[3:21:45] RafaCuglo: He's not the best auto attacker
[3:22:36] Mirphys: it looks like works well tho
[3:22:37] RafaCuglo: I mean zwag
[3:24:37] Mirphys: im talking about results
[3:24:45] Mirphys: overall winrate
[3:24:47] RafaCuglo: Yeah, it seems consistent
[3:25:10] LetTheScoutCook: totaly true
[3:25:32] Mirphys: it different with your games
[3:25:38] Mirphys: if you dont win lane hard you lose
[3:26:19] Mirphys: oh shit he cookin
[3:27:05] Mirphys: oh solarbacca
[3:27:11] Mirphys: ok
[3:27:13] LetTheScoutCook: i was playing.. but back to resist vs hp.. i did some test where .. let say you have 900g .. its better to buy belt.. with belt u sustain like 20 attacks from teemo.. and with negatron .. u sustain like 14
[3:27:56] LetTheScoutCook: even vs liandry its still better build hp.. u end up with more hp after 1 shroom
[3:28:07] LetTheScoutCook: idk why
[3:29:18] Mirphys: top is solarbacca if he doesnt go 0-5 generally he does well
[3:29:38] LetTheScoutCook: i disagree too
[3:29:43] LetTheScoutCook: he needs ms and as
[3:29:45] LetTheScoutCook: for jg
