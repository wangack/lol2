[0:54:40] SavannahChan: @Maurloven It's very tempting ngl
[0:54:57] label939: @kalibula123
[0:55:36] SavannahChan: I honestly had no idea romancing the characters was so easy. like after I got karlach in my camp gale, astarion and shadowheart were potentials??? like how
[0:55:38] Maurloven: @SavannahChan It's very good! Idk how the bugs are now but I still loved all of it in the start when it was a buggy mess lol
[0:56:08] TiodoPave_1: I'm surprised asf that boomer doesn't know what Xiaomi is
[0:56:30] Maurloven: I am doing honor mode but I ruined my last save after coming home drunk :)))) so taking a break now LMAO
[0:56:30] SavannahChan: @Maurloven I love it tbh, I never played DND before and a friend gifted it to me. Kinda been obssessed with it since
[0:56:35] Maurloven: stupid goblins
[0:56:56] SavannahChan: honor mode????? whattttt
[0:57:01] SavannahChan: I just play explorer LMAOOOOO
[0:57:38] Maurloven: fdgd yeah honor mode is hard af so far xD I have finished on tactician before but god damn I die in a lot of stupid ways
[0:57:51] Maurloven: Most of them are just " I wanna see what's gonna happen"
[0:58:24] SavannahChan: I'm more into actual storytelling and lore when it comes to those type of games, so I just picked explorer
[0:58:42] TiodoPave_1: me go MorningRoutine

[0:58:54] SavannahChan: I mean... you're right
[0:59:02] Maurloven: @SavannahChan the first three or so months after the full release I slept 5 hours every night because I played all night and then couldn't sleep again whenever I woke up in the morning because I just wanted to play lmao

[0:59:57] Nightbot: Auto is 96 years old.
[0:59:59] SavannahChan: @Maurloven I was playing with a group of friends but they started doing other games so I've been on my own and I downloaded cosmetic mods... mannn it's so nice
[1:00:02] Citrussyyy: Accurate
[1:00:05] Maurloven: I mean the story is so good so if harder difficulty would stop you from playing then easy mode is 100% valid aut0H
[1:00:15] Citrussyyy: Hi lazel doglComfy
[1:00:25] label939: aut0Cook
[1:00:36] Citrussyyy: aut0Pog
[1:00:46] Maurloven: @SavannahChan Yeah I played with my SO at first but I enjoyed it a lot more alone tbh hfgsdkfg since you get a lot more npc interaction that way
[1:01:09] SavannahChan: I die easily at those types of games though. Resident Evil is literally my favorite video game series of all time and I alwaays play on eaasiest difficulty
[1:01:46] Maurloven: Only times I will play on hard difficulty is if I am replaying the game many times lmao
[1:02:05] SavannahChan: @Maurloven I haven't made it to baldur's gate yet. I just got through the mountain pass. Like I went through and saved there. If that tells you where I'm at in the story
[1:02:24] Nightbot: https://twitter.com/Autolykus_  https://discord.gg/Wq8X9qZ  https://www.youtube.com/c/Autolykus   https://www.tiktok.com/@autolykus https://www.instagram.com/autolykus
[1:02:47] Maurloven: Ooo nice!! Did you already explore the underdark or did you go straight to the mountain pass?
[1:02:57] SavannahChan: I explored the Underdark!
[1:03:02] Nightbot: Check out and upvote if you like to the top! https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/12-5-autolykuss-challenger-sett-guide-594869
[1:03:37] Maurloven: nice nice >:) You have a loot left if you explore and do a lot of sidecontent!!
[1:04:20] Maurloven: I think my first save took like 120 hours ish? iirc
[1:04:27] SavannahChan: 120 HOURS?
[1:04:45] Maurloven: fdgdf yeah but I did like EVERYTHING I could find
[1:05:08] Maurloven: But when I played again I would still find so much new stuff
[1:05:14] SavannahChan: I can't even say anything I've played BG for 64 hours and haven't been to the gate LMAO
[1:05:19] SavannahChan: I just literally explore
[1:05:51] Maurloven: Yeah the gate is pretty late in the game haha
[1:06:07] SavannahChan: Ohhh okay okay now I feel less dumb, thank you or that lol
[1:06:12] SavannahChan: SETT YESSSSSSS
[1:06:21] kalibula123: sett game no way
[1:06:26] kalibula123: aut0Left aut0Flex aut0Right
[1:06:30] SavannahChan: I want his prestige skin so bad...
[1:06:47] Maurloven: @SavannahChan haha np xD Just take your time on the game and enjoy it!!
[1:07:34] Maurloven: I didn't even do one of the coolest bosses in the game until my 3rd or 4th run lol
[1:07:49] SavannahChan: @Maurloven all I'm gonna say is... I didn't really like lae'zel but now... idk she kinda mommy
[1:08:15] Maurloven: Okay real talk, Lae'Zel is actually so cute if you romance her
[1:08:30] Maurloven: I cried at her act 2 romance scene :')
[1:08:45] Maurloven: was too cute
[1:08:53] SavannahChan: I wanted to romance Lae'zel on my male quest, but she was so mean and then shadowheart was like "heyyyyy let's spend a night together" and then I was like "ok cool"
[1:09:03] vlad316293: Sup Auto
[1:09:04] SavannahChan: then lae'zel next day was like "I wanna taste you" and I was like whatttt
[1:09:17] kalibula123: it’s a kid auto, remember
[1:09:20] Maurloven: lmaooo
[1:09:25] kalibula123: kid dragon
[1:09:45] Maurloven: All of the romancable characters are so good tbh
[1:09:55] trescaa: pants are using so delai
[1:10:10] trescaa: much*
[1:10:30] SavannahChan: I wanted to romance Astarion but I heard he's difficult
[1:10:34] Maurloven: I tried to romance Minthy on one of my evil runs but it got bugged so I got almost no interactions in act 3 with her :(
[1:10:38] flognawkid0: Smolder top aut0L
[1:10:42] Maurloven: Astarion is my baby
[1:10:50] hrh_capitano: Hello Auto. The new champion is almost as annoying as Vayne top
[1:11:18] Maurloven: It's pretty easy to get him to like you actually, even tho he gets mad when you're nice the disapproval from those doesn't ruin it completely
[1:11:32] flognawkid0: FREE KILLS BABY
[1:11:33] Maurloven: Just be nice to him and he will like you eventually xD
[1:11:44] flognawkid0: aut0Chad aut0P
[1:11:52] SavannahChan: I let him bite me and he killed me :(
[1:12:01] SavannahChan: drank all my blood like it was a milkshake
[1:12:17] Maurloven: dhfds did you fail the rolls? or did you just let him continue? xD
[1:12:24] SavannahChan: um.....
[1:12:30] SavannahChan: I kinda wanted to see what would happen....
[1:12:30] Maurloven: hehe
[1:12:33] SavannahChan: LOL
[1:12:58] Maurloven: The cutscene after you revive yourself and talk to him is funny af :')
[1:13:04] SavannahChan: Yeah it is! lol
[1:13:08] Maurloven: He has so many good moments
[1:13:19] SavannahChan: I want to try an evil playthrough but man... idk I don't like bad endings

[1:14:05] msluciphine: Gm buddies marikySpoopy marikySpoopy marikySpoopy
[1:14:24] SavannahChan: When I played Detroit Become Human I finished it with good ending. But I wanted to get the trophy and I had to get bad endings... legit hated it
[1:14:38] Maurloven: I got the bad ending on my first run x.x It's okay but the good ending is so much more fulfilling
[1:15:53] Maurloven: I would suggest going good first and then making a new save for evil stuff
[1:15:56] SavannahChan: wow that smolder is so annoying lmao
[1:16:07] Maurloven: Dark urge is also very cool to play!
[1:16:32] trescaa: the new stride is good?
[1:16:47] SirFatterThe3rd: KEKW
[1:16:55] SirFatterThe3rd: that stacking poke
[1:17:39] SavannahChan: @Maurloven okay bet, I'll keep that in mind. I'll eventually suck it up and do an evil playthrough lol
[1:18:17] Maurloven: It will feel horrible if you're invested in the characters! xD But it's a cool experience since it's so different
[1:19:04] SavannahChan: I got closer to Gale and I want to make a new run just to romance him and focus on his story...
[1:19:52] SavannahChan: When I first met him I kinda felt like he was irrelevant
[1:20:44] Maurloven: Gale is very nice <:) But I'm happy they chanced some of his interactions lmao! It used to be some situations where you could either be super mean to him or romance him, nothing in between
[1:21:06] Maurloven: So he seemed sooo clingy at the time lol
[1:21:21] Maurloven: But now you have more friendly options with him
[1:21:52] trescaa: so close man
[1:21:56] Maurloven: I still did not romance him.. I was going to on my honor run but I need Karlach for an achievement lmao
[1:23:01] SavannahChan: Karlach seems really cool, I haven't interacted with her much yet though. in this male quest I want to be focused on lae'zel
[1:24:27] SavannahChan: Rakan is so pretty, so bummed I didn't get his prestige skin aut0Hm
[1:24:51] Maurloven: Karlach is probably the nicest character out of all of the main 6, but it also feels good to "win over" some of the less nice characters lmaoo
[1:25:28] SavannahChan: I lowkey wanna romance halsin. gives off buff dadddy bear vibes
[1:25:45] Maurloven: Halsin is sooo nice
[1:26:27] SavannahChan: He is! literally the cutest
[1:27:30] vlad316293: Rep Jungle ong
