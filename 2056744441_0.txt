[3:30:40] NamesBond_007: @EmmatheRedPanda lol
[3:31:36] EmmatheRedPanda: Smolder is so cute in the character-selection artwork, but then in game his face has no shape whatsoever lol
[3:33:00] Joker_GGEZ: good morning I'm so tired my brain is flying
[3:33:04] Joker_GGEZ: are we winning
[3:33:13] EmmatheRedPanda: Morning Joker!
[3:33:27] TeaQLive: lets gooooo
[3:33:37] TeaQLive: ello everyone+
[3:33:45] TeaQLive: moin joker
[3:33:46] GuyInRobe: He E can go to your E is odd
[3:36:24] FrozenLavaReflector: Since ive missed a couple of games, why spear rush?
[3:36:40] vDaishar: He probably doesnt know his ult & your E interaction
[3:37:00] jeskieKAT: Chat vampire weekend have announced their first album in 5 years ppOverheat
[3:37:09] vDaishar: Ahhhh damn
[3:38:43] OldestDreamer: sweet
[3:38:45] BluerBlack: I dont get new meta
[3:39:01] BluerBlack: I mean after the rebalancing few years ago
[3:39:20] BluerBlack: You would never choose that champ for mid
[3:39:48] BluerBlack: Smolder is fine
[3:40:11] BluerBlack: I mean Talon
[3:40:30] BluerBlack: You have range, you have everying that mid should have
[3:40:42] VengfulDark: I thought Talon was still amid laner
[3:40:55] BluerBlack: With you can still farm even when heavy countered
[3:42:17] VengfulDark: Talon i thought goes mid because he roams so fast.
[3:43:23] friendlyestdirt: is there a bonus effect at max stacks?
[3:43:45] BluerBlack: But if he cant roam then its just so bad
[3:43:51] VengfulDark: after max stacks it increases exicute range.
[3:44:12] BluerBlack: I always thought that mid is all about farm
[3:44:14] friendlyestdirt: ah
[3:44:21] wowtequila: used his hot maybe
[3:44:27] BluerBlack: you can roam if you know you can get kill
[3:44:30] wowtequila: ult*
[3:44:44] BluerBlack: but if you have no chance then you are just behind
[3:44:45] OldestDreamer: top is all about farming KEKW
[3:44:53] VengfulDark: Also every ability smolder does does extra magic damage based on stacks.
[3:45:44] gandalfster: zilean players ICANT
[3:45:50] THE_Bacon90: i think u still had bomb on u when you went into the bush there
[3:46:16] vDaishar: Is this your 1st AP smolder game?
[3:46:25] BluerBlack: I always thought that roaming is just a bonus because its all about if you can with team play
[3:46:28] VengfulDark: Mid is the closest lane to everything, while also being the shortest. So you either want to roam, or you want to farm and scale
[3:46:32] VengfulDark: preferably both
[3:46:47] BluerBlack: if they have heavy vision is just bad
[3:46:54] BluerBlack: @VengfulDark YEP
[3:47:13] BluerBlack: but you dont have really control how enemy plays the vision game
[3:47:18] Halofan642: w max with ap? e doesn’t have ap scaling
[3:47:21] FrozenLavaReflector: Whats the reasoning behind this build?
[3:47:35] GuyInRobe: Is Smolder E no longer untargetable? or was I wrong on just how taht worked
[3:47:44] VengfulDark: Yeah, but riot heavily nerfed vision and added river objectives to fight over
[3:48:00] VengfulDark: Smolder E auto targets
[3:48:05] friendlyestdirt: tragic
[3:48:10] vDaishar: 19min 225

[3:49:35] Halofan642: shojin gives 12% on abilities, riftmaker gives 10% extra damage and omnivamp, liandrys gives 6% extra damage and dot as well
[3:49:38] VengfulDark: I liked the warding junglers. made invades feel nice
[3:49:44] VengfulDark: and made them super easy

[3:51:35] champrath: isnt riftmaker just okay here
[3:51:42] champrath: prob there is something better
[3:51:50] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[3:52:10] VengfulDark: the point is you build all the items that increase Q true damage burn

[4:02:50] Halofan642: 12 from shojin, 10 from riftmaker, and 6 from liandrys i think
[4:03:25] skeeld: it keeps the haunting guise passive doesnt it
[4:03:27] Halofan642: it has mask

[4:03:34] Halofan642: the 1300 gold item
[4:03:38] Halofan642: yeah haunting guise that’s what it’s called
[4:03:49] Lau_340: are you challenger yet?

[4:09:20] hypherion7: does smolder feel good as a mid laner?
[4:09:40] hypherion7: ty for that :)
[4:09:46] skeeld: is that just because bot you have to coinflip supports tho
[4:10:03] Gragnoth: 3 stacks, worth

[4:11:46] blazin_barbie: gm 5upWave
[4:11:48] VengfulDark: l9ganjHo 5upDance
[4:11:53] BluerBlack: I think smolder is like really hard to counter in lane
[4:12:12] AkitaAttribute: graves flashed
[4:12:17] Gragnoth: graves flashed
[4:12:28] champrath: @BluerBlack his w just chunks
[4:12:33] hypherion7: risky with no pot
[4:12:53] BluerBlack: and he can get back hp
[4:13:03] BluerBlack: I think we will see w nerf in the past
[4:13:08] BluerBlack: in the future* LUL
[4:13:09] VengfulDark: I said he had Kogmaw Vibes, and now that he's putting 3 points W
[4:13:16] hypherion7: let's go~!
[4:13:25] Gragnoth: shyv didn't need to flash there
[4:13:25] champrath: that was a lot of stacks
[4:13:32] hypherion7: no one saw it
[4:13:58] VengfulDark: I'm fine with Smolder being good in lane.
[4:14:23] BluerBlack: The w is kinda insane
[4:14:37] Halofan642: yeah the w is so crazy lmao
[4:14:45] BluerBlack: you cant really counter it, I think they will make it go up first hit
[4:15:27] HARPUIN: Sylas stealin your mom D:
[4:15:29] BluerBlack: or be way slower
[4:15:31] Gragnoth: oh no, Sylas can call Smolder's mom!
[4:15:34] hypherion7: lol
[4:15:41] vDaishar: Thats gonna be one big gator
[4:15:48] hypherion7: so close!
[4:16:04] iggeh: i wish Sylas VA screamed "Mom" when he uses Smolder ult
[4:16:07] Halofan642: this malphite talking about “shyv dying fucked me so hard”
[4:16:21] Halofan642: man u we’re 1/2, 15 cs to 40 before the shyv died
[4:16:38] Gragnoth: why spear instead of essence?
[4:16:41] hypherion7: she should have that
[4:17:04] Halofan642: malphite just like me. coping beyond belief
[4:17:16] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[4:17:37] Halofan642: @gragnoth it gives a fuck ton of ability haste + the 12% extra damage scales really well late
[4:17:51] Halofan642: and it gives like 300 hp that essence doesnt
[4:17:55] Gragnoth: @Halofan642 ah, thanks
[4:18:06] VengfulDark: It's a burn build.
[4:18:16] Halofan642: so the dmg is comparable with the % increase and u get lots of q stacks fast and ofc more q’s in team fights
[4:18:40] Halofan642: he takes manaflow to try and fix the mana problems
[4:18:59] FrozenLavaReflector: the good news, hes playing malphite and can still be useful even when behind
[4:19:18] vDaishar: Hmmm interesting choice
[4:19:41] VengfulDark: I think smolder probably has less damage then ADC's like Jinx unless the target is someone with a lot of HP
[4:20:18] VengfulDark: Might* not probably
[4:20:33] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[4:20:48] hypherion7: you were 0/1/0, had a commercial, now you are 1/1/3. What happened?
[4:21:21] Halofan642: they tried to dive and shyv counter ganked
[4:21:39] hypherion7: @Halofan642 ty mate!
[4:22:22] VengfulDark: He's 2/3 there isn't even a reason to be mad
[4:22:34] Halofan642: np ! idk how the other kp happened tho. lmao

[4:23:59] JustaStoopidDog: ayayay
[4:24:01] Gragnoth: what's funny is shyv wanted top, but malph said he's a top main
[4:24:06] hypherion7: O.o
[4:24:07] shadowwolfheck: how are you getting people like this in masters?
[4:24:18] hypherion7: gummy worm fingers on your allies
[4:24:42] Halofan642: @shadowwolfheck tilt queueing, first timing, and the worst of them all, they coulda bought their accounts or are boosted
[4:24:48] Halofan642: also masters players grief a lot still tbh
[4:25:09] VengfulDark: Oh it must still have Malphite Hitbox despite being Sylas
[4:25:26] C_DEZZ: can you explain the new  build for my tiny brain
[4:25:28] VengfulDark: Also did Malph pick before or after Sylas?
[4:25:31] shadowwolfheck: @Halofan642 first timing being first time playing the champ?
[4:26:08] iauja: skill diff
[4:26:18] BluerBlack: Oh now just blame the champ
[4:26:19] ChimeZee: this is honestly why i always bad sylas mid
[4:26:20] BluerBlack: Kappa
[4:26:22] Halofan642: @shadowwolfheck yeah
[4:26:27] ChimeZee: ban*
[4:26:34] shadowwolfheck: thanks
[4:26:41] Halofan642: nice more sylas haters BASED
[4:26:48] Drude27: there are just too many champs to ban
[4:27:13] Gragnoth: you're shyvana is a nasus main
[4:27:17] iauja: shes practicing before the rework
[4:27:21] Gragnoth: they basically only play Nasus
[4:27:22] VengfulDark: @C_DEZZ Basically, Spear, both Haunting Guise items, and then rapid fire for long teamfights, being tanky, and more burn damage
[4:27:59] C_DEZZ: makes sense i suppose
[4:28:09] VengfulDark: did they anounce the Skarner rework?
[4:28:57] VengfulDark: the idea is he scales well off every stat, and you don't get 1 shot
[4:29:13] BluerBlack: Sureeee
[4:29:15] iauja: sure it is
[4:29:16] BluerBlack: KEKW
[4:29:18] iauja: nt
[4:29:28] iauja: uh
[4:29:35] iauja: 31 stacks mr.
[4:29:36] iauja: dont lie
[4:29:48] Halofan642: @vengfuldark also the ability haste on shojin
[4:29:49] 9fierce9: Iauja 5up cant count
[4:29:53] Halofan642: lots of q stacks early
[4:29:54] 9fierce9: Clueless
[4:30:19] iauja: what
