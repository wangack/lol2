[0:31:57] z3urnwi: i've seen a lot of aatrox lethality into hydra in korea, its just a different playstyle or a pick for sth?
[0:32:02] PowerWinsTop: @icesugarzed im grandmasters & zed is the easiest mid laner in the game
[0:32:11] lufitoo: that q2 is soo nasty
[0:32:15] icesugarzed: i can play qiyana with my eyes closed, zed u have to hit 3 shurikens in order to deal 300 damage
[0:32:26] LoLZuma: Zil died with ulty OMEGALUL
[0:32:48] icesugarzed: @PowerWinsTop im challenger and zed in a terrible situation, well now he is better than last season

[0:33:48] toxicoboyy: @icesugarzed nah it's boring i'm not a meta slave i prefer having fun
[0:34:12] icesugarzed: zed is below b tier midlaners right now
[0:34:20] matoG4: @toxicoboyy your opinion on champs has no value if you're below masters
[0:34:21] toxicoboyy: @icesugarzed and it is ez to counter just get zonhya
[0:34:24] kakoetc: qiyana is much more difficult than zed wtf
[0:34:34] PowerWinsTop: zed isn't that easy but the champ is too forgiving imo - very safe if played correctly

[0:35:55] toxicoboyy: @icesugarzed skillwise silver or masters is the same

[3:12:03] lisandro_azara: But some ppl just win and keep getting the same lobby levels
[3:12:06] cheerios20203: @Nacctel he goes ahead and insults the entire chat pretending to be the league player that god himself has bestowed upon us and i deserve to get banned?
[3:12:22] ExGKroNoS: Toplane somehow feels like you can interract with your team but just too late to have impact
[3:12:48] Nacctel: @Nacctel man holy shit nobody deserves a ban...  just a fucking timeout for 30 minutes cus u both are doing the same exact thing just insulting eachother for literaly no reason instead of calming down and thinking like reasonable people
[3:12:54] martelo_e_soco: Toplaner are basically cucks
[3:13:31] cheerios20203: @Nacctel yeah you are right i am not typing to that guy aswell but he is a total asshole. He didn't insult just me he insulted the entire chat and maybe i am the only one to get tilted at those guys
[3:13:47] toshnii: i feel like most of my games are decided by random shit that happen at voidgrubs around 10 minute mark
[3:14:02] Themilz: botlane just coinflip the game on lvl 2 almost every game
[3:14:07] Nacctel: @Nacctel doesnt justify insulting him for no reason, just leave him alone he'll stop typing x)

His ultimate goal is to help his laners, although he rarely accomplishes that. Here we can observe a specimen that has lost his life purpose and is just existing in a game
