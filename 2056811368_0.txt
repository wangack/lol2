[0:42:47] Casyo99: @Casyo99 I have been losing a lot too nowadays...

[1:20:35] jimbob_ywert: going through a bit of depression rn, but one of the best lessons I’ve learnt is that life is like a bow and arrow. the arrow must be held BACK before it’s thrown super fast into its target. target is happiness, you go through sadness before you reach your happiness, loved that agnolotti :)
[1:20:42] J_to_the_jf: vernHey @Darkcyter

[1:22:11] AllyCaatt: @atichii if it’s prestige it won’t have chromas so probably wasn’t I’m gonna assume I didn’t get to see it
[1:22:17] DragoonRed: briar e? i believe so
[1:22:22] quad_ki11er4: predict who get more kill u or briar
[1:22:26] DragonOfSorrow: Yes, you can charm her out of it, but it's a damage reduction so be careful
[1:22:52] Jippelius: Well, I hardlost my game, how did your last go?
[1:23:00] Jippelius: Did shen carry?

[1:42:13] ObsceneSanity: you might end up selling orb
[1:42:16] kid_kirua: orb is great but morello feels like such a waste of money. it's so awkward just having orb in inventory tho :(
[1:42:16] DragoonRed: I think back in the day the grievous went from 30-40% but they changed that (or maybe thats the phys items)

[2:40:07] silentButDadly: Yeah isn't he nearly fully machine?
[2:40:12] kaithegemini: I always here that song that goes "everyday im shuffling" when he does his lil dancey dance

[2:40:48] Gar116: The three of you stunned just looking at each other like 👁️ 👄 👁️
[2:41:02] lostmycologist: will be 0/5 and wipe your team in a fight
[2:41:05] Hymuno: but on the other hand, she has cute skins Kappa
[2:41:21] CESlush: I think there needs to be a few more tweaks to control mage vs. assassin mage damage and items.  The last patch was not enough.
[2:41:24] lostmycologist: lol hym
[2:41:27] Nauway: i feel like laning phase doesn't matter as much anymore morfShrug

[2:43:23] DemionDemon: so by that logic you need to lose the next one. so it`s gradual.

[2:43:56] Nauway: see we knew you could do it morfYeah
[2:44:09] LonaLuxe: have you considered also streaming on TikTok? a lot of streamers are gaining larger audiences by doing this

[2:45:22] eliotxshadowfrost21: I would never go to tik tok looking to watch someone stream a game. that sounds like crazy talk to me
[2:45:56] AllyCaatt: AllyCaatt is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to KayPea's community! They've gifted a total of 16 in the channel! 
[2:45:56] AllyCaatt: AllyCaatt gifted a Tier 1 sub to pinkkikitsune! 
[2:46:09] LonaLuxe: @eliotxshadowfrost21 streamers do it .. twitch and tiktok, i know a small streamer that has over 500 viewers on twitch because they gained people from tiktok. not crazy talk lol

[2:47:55] ItsAMoll: CSing, map control, remembering to ward
[2:48:03] MingBong_: @KayPea Ive always wondered what rank you would be if you played ranked, i watched you with Siv from a long time ago as you can see xD
[2:48:05] Napping_Sab: for me is stop trying to help my team that made bad decision
[2:48:09] trivela2k: good thing lucas isnt here so i dont have to choose streams

[2:49:02] DJ_Photik: More drum N bass like Fox Stevenson ❤️🥰
[2:49:15] FiveFM: I'm noticing a distinct lack of floof in the background lately! kaypFreya kaypAnnoyed
[2:49:22] eliotxshadowfrost21: @LonaLuxe I mean,  currency in streaming isnt heavily weighed on views. Success generally comes from sponsors and the regular memberships on a platform of people who recurringly become members or subs and what not. So viewers from tik tok arently likely to come over to twitch and sub so it just sounds like extra work with little return. crazy talk to me.
[2:49:27] xLippyy: dat bot lane gotcha good
[2:49:28] MojoXan: you look amazing :)
[2:49:46] xLippyy: justtt got me hair cut haha.

[2:54:26] DragoonRed: and you just CHUNK from afar with headshot procs
[2:54:31] DemionDemon: lethality is deffo better.
[2:54:32] ballzagna1: storm into kraken into IE
[2:54:45] watermeelon_juice: one of the rarest skin in league is this Caitlyn skin if I’m not wrong
[2:54:48] Qcseebb: urf is back im so excited

[2:56:20] CuznVin: I like the attempt
[2:56:32] belallaj: going crit or lethality?

[2:58:19] Darkcyter: self education kaypWHAT
[2:58:39] J_to_the_jf: I still feel like they need to bring back the bad at the game report make people either get better or get banned from game modes
[2:58:40] quark978: personally i find that crit is bad right now. I'd go stormrazor into lethality. But to each their own. adc is in a weird spot rn
[2:59:42] ObsceneSanity: lethality cait i think is stronger
[2:59:48] FeenaGreene: at least you won't have a 1/24 botlane this game.. i hope :3
[3:00:10] DragoonRed: lethality cait is easier to play, you just r off cd
[3:00:26] inSINwetrust: Collector would be great this game
[3:00:36] quark978: collector, axiom arc, hubris if fed
[3:00:43] ObsceneSanity: Collector > Hubris
[3:00:58] DemionDemon: that wud definitely not happen since Janna already has 2 kills
[3:00:59] shedfirekid1: support cait is on duty this game kaypPolice
[3:01:40] eliotxshadowfrost21: I just got gifted a sub to a channel ive never heard of. i still to this day never understood how that happens
[3:01:41] ObsceneSanity: hubris is mejais for ad
[3:01:48] Gar116: Hubris is like dark seal for AD I think
[3:02:02] Gar116: Helps you snow ball
[3:02:03] DemionDemon: but you dont lose stacks i think
[3:02:04] DJ_Photik: Does it upgrade
[3:02:18] ObsceneSanity: you dont lose stacks, but you dont keep the buff perma either
[3:02:26] DJ_Photik: Something about statues?

[3:03:35] Darkcyter: @GNGNUT 71 kaypHYPERS WB
[3:03:41] GNGNUT: All good thanks - awsoem good to see happy face after a long day at work :)
[3:04:17] DragoonRed: if you play with actually auto attacking i presonally prefer storm razor rapid ie. if you just fall back and play with only q/r and some traps its better to be lethality

[3:06:10] AzogDaAussie: collector, no?
[3:06:10] jimbob_ywert: infinity edge is good next
[3:06:18] inSINwetrust: Collector
[3:06:24] quark978: next item collector or IE
[3:06:36] lawfulevil_13: Vayne is really hard for Cait because of how easy it is to run her down
[3:06:43] J_to_the_jf: your opinion on making a report for bad players to get them taken out of ranked?
[3:06:49] jimbob_ywert: Collectors is only good if they’re mostly squishy
[3:07:05] ObsceneSanity: Ohh they nerfed lethality cait in the dirt last patch. What the fuck
[3:07:10] quark978: yes berserker boots are always great
[3:07:29] VanillaEssenceLoL: heeyyyyy kaypArrive
[3:07:30] DragoonRed: @ObsceneSanity how badly? i preferred non lethality cait anyways
[3:07:35] ObsceneSanity: ADC get no fun this season. holy shit.
[3:07:37] kristykat_: yea hes always looking
[3:07:43] inSINwetrust: Still better than crit
[3:07:48] ObsceneSanity: @ObsceneSanity they reduced ad from collector and yommu

[3:08:47] Lazlowe_: Press R more. Don’t save it for that perfect kill, it’s free dmg (imho)
[3:08:51] ObsceneSanity: and caitlyns headshot is bugged. your e consumes the charge, and the charge is being used on non-champ targets too

[3:13:53] ShyTywin: nice clean up from Fizz at least
[3:14:02] DemionDemon: they have a Fiora?
