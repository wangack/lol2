[2:50:21] ifutureworld: maybe illaoi is freelo now
[2:50:35] HollowPurpleOwl: she is such a stupid design
[2:50:51] HollowPurpleOwl: the counterplay is literally to just completely avoid her
[2:50:53] MistaBass: @HollowPurpleOwl yeah, me too FeelsOkayMan

[2:51:48] ifutureworld: akali has so many bailouts
[2:52:09] drewpace1: shes more of a fighter i feel'
[2:52:18] EatingYourBeans: i pray that akali is the next ryze, she needs like 3 more reworks
[2:52:26] HollowPurpleOwl: nah man, their champions don't have overloaded kits overall Kappa
[2:53:23] HollowPurpleOwl: if she was a fighter she would just be tanky, she wouldn't be able to go stealth for 30 seconds and have 3 dashes
[2:53:42] HollowPurpleOwl: problem is she is tanky, does a shit ton of dmg, and has stealth+infinite mobility
[2:54:07] mentelman11: your hitbox is massive lol
[2:54:09] ifutureworld: ohhh cwap
[2:54:32] ifutureworld: tough game
[2:54:40] TheDrikke: looking like a mcdefeat

[2:56:23] GetzJiggy: @HollowPurpleOwl but 75g negating an entire champion's playstyle?
[2:56:25] ricfaria99: at 60 minutes
[2:56:26] Tacocrazy08: so about that
[2:56:33] TheDrikke: this was just a fluke, lock naut in again next game
[2:56:36] Alderini: awful
[2:56:44] ferhat1802: yeah thats not so good
[2:56:44] TsukiTengu: very low
[2:56:46] Rothock: hes not getting a chance to get stacks
[2:56:59] SickLiq: should be about 225 at 25 min
[2:57:02] mickey31313: he needs 225 stacks
[2:57:03] Tacocrazy08: 225 is perma elder buff or something
[2:57:05] yerboiraf: its 225 stakcs not 300
[2:57:24] SpamShot_SPQR: shipAYAYA /\ legitkAYAYA
[2:57:25] mickey31313: his stacks are pret low
[2:57:41] Richthofen187: doing good on stacks would be about 10 per minute so around 22:30 he would have 225
[2:57:58] Rothock: illaoi just got too juiced
[2:58:03] SickLiq: @yerboiraf 225 is for elder, 300 is for third q split
[2:58:13] baranmuj: what up
[2:58:27] yerboiraf: @SickLiq but 225 is when hes already beast mode, 300 is just cherry on top no?
[2:58:52] SickLiq: @SickLiq not when they're this much behind
