[0:27:45] OceanBuffalo: i wish we could see who was deafened tbh, so we at least know not to waste our time trying to communicate
[0:27:47] PervFufu: people dont like to be told what to do so they do the exact opposite our of spite
[0:28:38] OceanBuffalo: @OceanBuffalo yeah i want to see 49ers win but think the chiefs is where safe money is
[0:30:21] Skyz_Ninjaz: I should have bet on the chiefs to help purdy out... Went on a huge streak a few weeks ago and I havent won a bet in about 30 bets
[0:30:46] drigers5: holy fucking shit vlad almost went to sidelane. he still went mid though

[0:30:57] OceanBuffalo: you see that meme of the guy who said he's gotten the last 16 super bowl bets wrong and he's picking the chiefs for this one?
[0:30:58] CESlush: @Skyz_Ninjaz That's where I am. I don't mind either team.  But, Purdy has a cool story.
[0:31:01] JCRainFGC: fuck
[0:31:51] Skyz_Ninjaz: @CESlush My only reason I wouldnt mind seeing the chiefs is I really like Jason Kelce even tho hes not even on the team LMAO
[0:31:57] czausmouse: based self control
[0:32:01] heiserg1: tell him to go 0/1 irl ig
[0:32:06] Skyz_Ninjaz: Both the Kelce's seem like cool dudes

[0:37:48] PervFufu: buy void staff then Kappa
[0:37:57] Warlord_Towel: Did thge game bug out and give you dark harvest
[0:38:10] OceanBuffalo: @knownhomie but it shouldn't be dealing magic damage to be affected by the hexdrinker shield regardless of who procced it
[0:38:10] Skyz_Ninjaz: @knownhomie Shaco E although scales with AD it is technically magic damage not physical
[0:38:27] knownhomie: well right but shaco wasnt the only champion doing damage to lucian
[0:38:57] knownhomie: ok there ya saw that one
[0:38:58] OceanBuffalo: if nobody else procced it, it would've procced on E anyway and done the same thing
[0:39:03] Jauneofarc: maw is so dumb
[0:39:03] false_monk: But you can see when you E and the shield block the damage
[0:39:05] knownhomie: lmao
[0:39:06] Berrus13131: BANA EL TIMER ESTA MAL
[0:39:10] OceanBuffalo: so who procced it is irrelevant @knownhomie
[0:39:12] KAPPE89: Hexdrinker PTSD
[0:39:12] drigers5: it's magic specifically so lethality is worse. it's not a design flaw, it's how you design champion balance.that's why briar Q got changed to magic damage
[0:39:16] Skyz_Ninjaz: regardless of who proc the hex drinker it still blocks E's AD damage because its magic
[0:39:40] knownhomie: Ah thats bullshit
[0:39:40] Nightbot: if only he was Zoe there
[0:39:42] knownhomie: TIL

[0:57:50] Nightbot: Follow me on TikTok for some bangers https://www.tiktok.com/@chaseshac
[0:57:56] millenial_14: with our kicker your never really in fg range
[0:58:03] dumbvurgin123: the recievers choked, not coachs fault
[0:58:19] OceanBuffalo: yeah 1 FG and 1 should've been a punt for sure
[0:58:21] Slymezzz: they lost the game when ayiuk got that catch
[0:58:24] Slymezzz: the momentum changed

[0:58:57] subtokick: Field goals should be a last ditch effort
[0:59:00] czj0725: yeah and we almost made the superbowl doing it all year it was the fking shitty ass receivers
[0:59:02] The_Stretch_: i mean, its not like Badgley is a good kicker....also you could argue that the reason they were there was cause of the aggressivness
[0:59:03] millenial_14: live and die by the sword, he was never gonna change his mind
[0:59:03] dumbvurgin123: of any coach in nfl
[0:59:07] OceanBuffalo: he's gotta be EU
[0:59:11] OceanBuffalo: soccer fan
[0:59:12] CESlush: found the 10-year old madden player lol
[0:59:30] OceanBuffalo: that's because they went for the most of anybody by far
[0:59:39] millenial_14: only reason we got as far as we did was because of his aggressiveness, don’t always agree with his call but he got them there
[0:59:39] OceanBuffalo: they were bound to have the highest number
[0:59:41] higglejiggle: campbell or harbaugh?
[0:59:50] Slymezzz: I dont think it was a bad play going for it, but he should not have trusted his defence
[0:59:54] Slymezzz: after how they played all year
[0:59:58] dumbvurgin123: thts insane lmao
[1:00:02] dumbvurgin123: 52 is od high
[1:00:10] subtokick: Well there's no points attached to the 52% rate, so its stupid either way
[1:00:15] Kashumee: @ChaseShaco  It's because it was a full moon and the coach his star sign is an aquarium so the  moons gravity affected his decision making
[1:00:24] Skyz_Ninjaz: Thats like Pat McAfee having the most onside kick recoveries in history. Like no shit. they did it almost once a game
[1:00:35] Skyz_Ninjaz: at the most random times possible
[1:00:37] dumbvurgin123: the recievers dropped 3 balls and gave interception lmao in hands lol the recievers choked
[1:00:43] millenial_14: chase look at our kickers fg % from 40+ yards, it’s not better than 50% so by the math going for it was the right call
[1:01:08] dumbvurgin123: they shuda won tht game lol
[1:01:25] OceanBuffalo: @millenial_14 short punt it then, going for it is not even the 2nd best option
[1:01:32] millenial_14: ya I agree
[1:01:41] delirium190808: dont u think rek'sai is way more harder to play against?

[1:02:29] subtokick: Tucker lost that trust this year
[1:02:39] Skyz_Ninjaz: Im not saying pat mcafee is not a fuckin badass

[1:04:47] Slymezzz: I think we can agree the coach is a headass for the call but the team is also shit for stopping to exist on both sides
[1:05:17] Engsy: live by the sword, die by the sword. can’t hate the man for sticking to his guns, but he made a bad decision

[1:05:51] acesilverdude: hi dad
[1:05:51] millenial_14: chase look at the yardage for the fgs, then look at our kickers % from 40+, the call was never kick the fg it was either go for it or punt
[1:06:15] Slymezzz: monty was just performing better all game
[1:06:20] OceanBuffalo: @CESlush i was watching the game at my grandpa's place and he was cussing up a storm and isn't even a lions fan KEKW

[1:08:00] composedentree: who’s the real legend between belicheck and Brady? could Brady have done something similar without belicheck and vice versa?
[1:08:03] Slymezzz: end of the day, they lost because of those 3 points
[1:08:05] Slymezzz: lol
[1:08:08] braindead_jungle: league of lobbies
