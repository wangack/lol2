[0:09:46] Skyz_Ninjaz: How many subs for a gainer Kappa
[0:09:47] Telperio: Is a front flip harder, it's not obvious to me because I am not agile at all LUL
[0:09:55] Skyz_Ninjaz: @Telperio Much harder
[0:10:49] bleacher51: what's the state of league atm haven't played since s5 LUL
[0:10:58] Skyz_Ninjaz: Backflip power comes from your legs/knees going up and a front flip power comes from your fists going forward/down
[0:11:00] OceanBuffalo: @bleacher51 items do a lot of damage
[0:11:11] bleacher51: so shaco should be good then
[0:11:37] Skyz_Ninjaz: Wait, ya... you right. 5 years of subs to my 4 years of comp.....

[0:13:21] asuryan180: @Squattzz Their kits are better than shaco's in basically everything, engage, disengage, more sustain
[0:13:29] asuryan180: the only thing shaco has is what, a strong early game I guess
[0:14:14] MrPepperJams: think shaco one of those "annoying when strong champs" so riot keeps him playable but weak

[1:58:53] Galkaria: reminder that the winrate that's displayed is only the last 20 games, you can have 200 wins under your belt but if your last 10 of 20 games are losses, you're at 50% WR

[2:00:15] OceanBuffalo: @Galkaria okay that's not true

[2:03:21] ChaseShaco: thats muy old riot acc
[2:03:26] ChaseShaco: that they toiok last seasons
[2:03:28] Ningbeck: @Galkaria bruh there are multiple winrates on opgg, the left side has the total, top is diff
[2:03:33] ChaseShaco: and wont give the id back
[2:03:55] chadshaco: cant belive chase is hiding his 35% wr account smh
[2:04:25] OGBrankoni: where are you
[2:04:34] ShinigamiHD: hes the one wearing white

[2:04:58] Ningbeck: obviously he was the one doing backflips
[2:05:01] Ningbeck: :)
[2:05:01] OceanBuffalo: he stopped typing, i think he's noticed that he was not reading the right part of the website
[2:05:04] Galkaria: brother the point i'm making to the viewers that can't read is that the big red and blue numbers that appear showing the winrate shows ONLY the last 20 games. chaseNA#1 shows the 7 wins 13 losses for your LAST TWENTY games on that account

[2:06:26] Ningbeck: like all of us
[2:06:32] Galkaria: 25% winrate over 20 games is shit, but that's not someone's overall win / loss ratio
[2:06:32] false_monk: But who cares about the last 20 games? You care about WR overall, not just last 20 games
[2:06:34] SirRiles: yeah we know there are both lol
