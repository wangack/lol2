[0:30:24] pp5685: this sentence is just "you like to read what book"
[0:30:57] pp5685: chinese put the object last, subject first
[0:31:51] pp5685: "you like to read what book" @ipav999
[0:31:59] pp5685: translate each word and u get it
[0:32:01] pp5685: kek
[0:32:07] porosga: Not sure if it was only Yoyo teacher, but the golden rule it was called. How you but subject, or somtimes time, first in a sentence.

[0:42:51] pp5685: @porosga :D
[0:43:16] pp5685: the day to day ones are only like 3000
[0:43:22] pp5685: its okayish
[0:43:26] porosga: I took one course only focusing on characters. But it was a little overwhelming.
[0:43:52] pp5685: according to chinese dictionary, ppl normally use 3500 chinese characters
[0:44:03] pp5685: a bit more than 26
[0:44:20] pp5685: HINDI monkaW
[0:44:23] porosga: @pp5685 I heard this so many times, but you can put those together to so many words so it's a small comfort :D
[0:44:24] pp5685: monkaS
[0:44:49] pp5685: @porosga yes :D
[0:45:05] porosga: But nowadays the young Chinese are also becoming less good with characters, so np :D
[0:46:20] pp5685: 汉字
[0:46:26] porosga: There are many rare ones you don't use often.
[0:46:30] pp5685: yea
[0:47:03] pp5685: such as this character 𰻞
[0:47:08] porosga: I guess it's for same reason as for us using English, it's not like we talk about everything that often.
[0:47:22] porosga: @pp5685 ;o
[0:47:38] pp5685: 𰻞 sole purpose is describe a noodle
[0:47:42] pp5685: biang biang noodle
[0:47:55] pp5685: most strokes in a chinese character
[0:48:07] porosga: You might wanna learn typing the Chinese. Since it's just about writing the pinyin and picking the right character. Might be most useful if you wanna play around with it.
[0:48:15] pp5685: ^
[0:48:29] porosga: And typing Chinese in Windows is free. Just have to add it.
[0:48:32] pp5685: but then he'd have to look thru all the selections
[0:48:54] porosga: @pp5685 yeah, but the most common ones are places first I think
[0:49:01] pp5685: just master pinyin so you can deal with chinese wintraders in game @ipav999
[0:49:09] pp5685: @porosga yes SeemsGood

[1:15:59] porosga: ah right, you can probably omit the huan from first part. But not in this example.
[1:18:39] porosga: xi huan bu xi huan, yes. but you can actually skip it I think, if I recall right.
[1:19:09] porosga: you are advanced :D
