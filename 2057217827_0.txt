[1:03:51] gondar_1908: Fiora is brainless af no one enjoys fighting her. if u lane against her it’s perma mini game standing the perfect angle to not get fked b passive just so she dashes 1 morbillion miles to reach u anyway. horrible design
[1:03:53] XChaoLanX: fiora is skill only

[2:44:25] Fluffles_xD: how do you think an interaction between kindred and jhin would go?
[2:45:04] browy_eu: Graves has such a fragile ego
[2:45:04] Fracnco: @Fluffles_xD why them?
[2:45:57] kawaiicaramel: lb no damage\
[2:46:06] Selene_Flore: Did Graves just ruin Yone's lane
[2:46:08] ramisaffour: How to tell league players that spamming pings while jhin ulting DOES NOT HELP
[2:46:46] SailorPluto9: @IKeepItTaco i cant decide if i should ban smolder or maokai now
[2:47:09] SailorPluto9: i had a smolder go 5-19 last game
[2:47:18] SailorPluto9: and i want these pple to suffer

[2:47:53] Selene_Flore: The jungle diff
[2:48:06] laikanangel: @ramisaffour What do you mean? of course it helps; it increases the Jhin player's killing intent, of course! Truly, it is a display of utmost thoughtfulness

[2:50:42] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Oh, Yone is the Draven top last game

[3:04:09] Fracnco: AD leblanc is... that shit dont have to exist
[3:04:12] cogstopper: Yo, is this the first good Maokai support you've had all year? hinaboPausechamp
[3:04:24] Fracnco: 4 jumps, 2 snares.... what more she need?
[3:04:34] kiritsisss: perfect example that this season added 5-7 minutes in every match
[3:05:09] tiisco45: i think you could have won last match if yone didn't pick draven  last match
[3:05:20] YunhoeeAteez: @Fracnco its only 2 jumps bae, and the jumps are her only dmg so u can kinda see why people go ad
[3:05:32] Macklez_: I think bobqin says AD is better too tho
[3:05:42] Name17200: lmao
[3:05:44] chipichipichapachapagr: 700g
[3:05:51] chipichipichapachapagr: ikeepitSMILERS
[3:06:03] YunhoeeAteez: I think it's because bobqin said, Leblanc's W is her only dmg for AP. so if the enemy team is good and wont let LB jump onto them, then she's basically useless
[3:06:06] Fracnco: @YunhoeeAteez still, a total pain ngl, i just hope they nerf her range and give in compensation some less cd in the skills
[3:06:21] Official_Owo: F
[3:06:22] Remotehead: huh
