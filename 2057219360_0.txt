[2:28:14] honeymustard91: @Daniblitz crypto is very volatile, even if it "crashes" as hard as the stock market in 2008 or energy in march 2020 it didnt *really* crash, because its just as likely that itll recover in a short while

[2:33:21] Daniblitz: @honeymustard91 True I guess. Lows after crashes went like sub dollar, 2 dollars, 30 dollars, 200 dollars 3k dollars, 15k dollars. If u think it long term crashed dont matter much. I stopped thinking about it though, maybe sell some coins in future otherwise meh
