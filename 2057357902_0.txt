[4:55:20] offcorser: Ive seen like 20 different smolder builds. Dont know how to feel about it
[4:55:32] Onionknight47: the tanky W max stuff seems to be doing well
[4:55:44] Onionknight47: remember when zeri sucked and people figured out how to maker her OP with a tank build?
[4:57:26] Onionknight47: I doubt smoulder would be Zeri-tier
[4:57:50] Onionknight47: but I think the champ probably is just like... not this essence reaver + navorri quickblades champ
[4:57:57] Onionknight47: and the good build is something else
[4:58:03] itkovian1: Definitely dont like to see kass or kayle get that shut down
[4:58:03] offcorser: Stacking dragons and stacking the dragon B)
[4:59:33] offcorser: Im surprised zyra doesnt have mana problems with this build but i guess u back pretty frequently
[5:00:05] Onionknight47: vi played that so well it gave udyr undue confidence
[5:00:07] Onionknight47: you hate to see it
[5:00:50] itkovian1: dont think that was worth it
[5:05:56] itkovian1: atleast the vi hits like a truck for now
[5:06:58] offcorser: In smolder we trust Prayge
[5:07:31] Ryance: the smolder Kreygasm
[5:10:33] offcorser: With the level of throwing, this has gotta be someones promos lmao
[5:10:42] offcorser: only a promo game is this hard to win
[5:13:46] Ryance: these games :(
[5:14:04] itkovian1: yeah that baron play and the kayle triple kill shortly after were killer
[5:14:12] Onionknight47: the kayle triple
[5:14:13] InternetCult: They picked kass and kaye and you didn't end the game before they got 16 so you lose
[5:14:14] Onionknight47: was a mega throw
[5:14:40] Onionknight47: they could have gotten double inhib if they didn't run it down chasing on enemy red
[5:14:48] Onionknight47: and throwing baron would have been bad
[5:14:53] Onionknight47: but it would have been salvageable
[5:15:00] itkovian1: also giving kassadin a free 900 gold didn't help
[5:17:10] Dragonslave49: Skateparkge
[5:18:55] Gromzzz: vlad ban ?
