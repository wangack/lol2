[4:57:08] DudeBroMaximus: god damn
[4:57:09] ThomasTheTwink: @jakmo it does not! a lot of tick damage doesn’t wake them up

[4:57:19] jannablowsu: that looks disgusting
[4:57:32] Lazynameross: her passive ccant turn off
[4:57:32] jinky___: it's persistent type damage
[4:57:36] ZoeGirl: mf ulti is counted as a dot

[5:07:48] ThomasTheTwink: smolder seems so useless
[5:07:53] DudeBroMaximus: he is
[5:08:04] DudeBroMaximus: unless you're Korean chally maybe
[5:08:21] ChromaKhroma: oop
[5:08:35] DudeBroMaximus: Ivern passive always trolling plays
[5:08:50] Jakmo: DL has a lot of success with him and think he's really strong in early lane to get a lead and avoid being useless in mid-game
[5:08:54] DudeBroMaximus: dude this skin rips, it looks so cool
[5:09:00] DudeBroMaximus: looks like Ultimecia from FF8
[5:09:13] ChromaKhroma: this chroma looks like a better version of bloodstone
[5:09:22] Jakmo: but a lot of people are just playing it because it's new, different, and exciting for a role that doesn't get to have fun
[5:09:31] TwitchTime89: what is she walking on?
[5:09:45] DudeBroMaximus: @Jakmo and everyone gets to lose when they pick it on their team
[5:09:46] DudeBroMaximus: so fun
[5:09:56] TwitchTime89: lmao
[5:09:58] not_a_persona: liss passive is so cool but i feel like it needs something just little bit more
[5:09:58] DudeBroMaximus: @TwitchTime89 well it's shards of ice in default skin
[5:10:14] ChromaKhroma: what about rylais rush
[5:10:17] Jakmo: smolder's w/r isn't that bad. it's definitely not an auto loss
[5:10:18] ChromaKhroma: Kappa
[5:10:20] DudeBroMaximus: maybe thorns in this skin?
[5:10:21] DudeBroMaximus: looks rad
[5:10:24] TwitchTime89: @TwitchTime89 tink so what would those be? they look like spider legs
[5:10:37] DudeBroMaximus: coven has heaps of thorns

[5:13:00] TheRiehlmfDeal: ADC inting and NOT blaming others?? cmon let’s be realistic
[5:13:15] archimedes_9: spam pingers think they are tactical masterminds when they are just emotional backseaters keking
[5:13:25] TwitchTime89: YEP
[5:13:29] bergsdal: ye spam pinging is mostly annoying
[5:13:45] DudeBroMaximus: sometimes spam pingers are legitimately switched on shotcallers and vision trackers
[5:13:48] DudeBroMaximus: once in a while you get a dummy tho
[5:13:55] Jakmo: 48.7 as ADC and 48.4 top lane. that's not that low
[5:14:06] DudeBroMaximus: @Jakmo agree I thought it would be lower
[5:14:44] archimedes_9: Smolder do be looking tanky 👀
[5:14:47] Jakmo: probably because you watch top players where her w/r is 45% LUL . for all ranks it's actually over 49
[5:15:05] DudeBroMaximus: nah just from my own games, pisslow selection bias

[5:26:56] TwitchTime89: peepoHey @denunciator
[5:26:57] Lazynameross: it starts at like 7%
[5:26:58] ChromaKhroma: its like 7% or something
[5:27:04] Lazynameross: just keeps growing
[5:27:05] denunciator: @TwitchTime89 howody
[5:27:14] ZoeGirl: yes
[5:27:15] JuniperB14: It scales with his stacks, like ASol
[5:27:17] BaneBladeV: it's 6-9 scaling owo
[5:27:19] ChromaKhroma: not a ton i think
[5:27:20] smileyy121: at 300 stacks probably 10%
[5:27:28] denunciator: ins't it 2%
[5:27:29] JohnixxM: yes it scales, 400 stacks is around 10%
[5:27:48] denunciator: 2% + 1%/40 stacks, so i guess at 225 stacks it is 7.6%
[5:28:13] DudeBroMaximus: what's the significance of 225 stacks? I see it referenced a lot
[5:28:18] TwitchTime89: stuntNoted
[5:28:19] denunciator: thats when he unlocks it
[5:28:22] DudeBroMaximus: ahhh
[5:28:23] denunciator: but imo the DOT burn is bigger than execute
[5:28:24] DudeBroMaximus: ty
[5:28:24] kebimbimbab: well shes playing cait in this era
[5:28:27] kebimbimbab: so like...]

[5:29:18] Lazynameross: aww
[5:29:20] DudeBroMaximus: hahaha
[5:29:29] JohnixxM: @DudeBroMaximus bc this attack has 3 lvls, after 25 stack it gives AO damage, after 125 it "jumps" to the backline and after 225 you get the % execute
[5:29:29] Apostolique: it was me
[5:29:33] DudeBroMaximus: Ziggs winning fights by baiting away your MVP
[5:29:49] ChromaKhroma: i mean he still gets stacks from farming
[5:29:58] hemlo_it_me: So is he doing every champ or just every letter?

[5:41:07] denunciator: bla
[5:41:34] kebimbimbab: i thought darius flashed before smolder tried to execute him
[5:41:56] Jakmo: does everyone have merc treads? or is Liss's R cc much shorter than I remember
[5:42:02] kebimbimbab: honestly
[5:42:06] bergsdal: XD ye
[5:42:09] bergsdal: Asking myself that
[5:42:09] ThomasTheTwink: this ziggs champion NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:42:19] bergsdal: If smolder had built properly then he would literally oneshot
[5:42:20] TwitchTime89: gg nt
[5:42:21] Exodius89: senna just flashed in and soloed caitlyn in the base GIGACHAD
[5:42:23] kebimbimbab: its diamond
[5:42:24] DudeBroMaximus: Smolder pea shooter
[5:42:27] patrynize: senna just casually 1v1ing the adc
[5:42:30] DudeBroMaximus: with all that gold and all those stacks
[5:42:31] kebimbimbab: I think you should just take the kills
[5:42:48] Lazynameross: can smolder literally one shot at any point with any build
[5:42:58] bergsdal: 23 kills and lacks in dmg lategamee XDDDD
[5:43:00] bergsdal: please
[5:43:14] bladetrinity16: @Lazynameross 1% execute per 40 stacks + 2% base
[5:43:15] mute_mousou: his positioning didn't seem great to me
[5:43:15] PsychoEm14: What is this smolder build, that just looks like a pile of items
[5:43:21] bladetrinity16: so you can do the math on the execute point
[5:43:30] Lazynameross: ok, in a realistic game
[5:43:38] bergsdal: that should be the case, ivve been in games where smolders get 250 stack and oneshots XD
[5:43:39] BaneBladeV: yes. liss is a tryhard pick
[5:43:42] DudeBroMaximus: Aatrox not farming for 20 mins was pretty bronze, I don't understand
[5:44:00] Lazynameross: i feel like no matter how plain or whacky the build is he never pops someone
[5:44:04] Shadomist: 17%ish
[5:44:07] Lazynameross: even when ahead
[5:44:15] Lazynameross: its always rather slow
[5:44:40] bladetrinity16: i didnt see the overall build so i cant judge on that
[5:44:45] ThomasTheTwink: who after liss? Lulu?
[5:45:10] bladetrinity16: 50%ish
[5:45:18] Exodius89: 49 last time i saw

[5:46:40] Jakmo: don't worry guys! 15% of that was when he didn't know what to do Kappa

[5:59:56] bladetrinity16: @JuniperB14 armour is useless wihtout the health to back it up
[6:00:03] Jakmo: Idk how to feel about Stunt as a support main being better with Lucian W than I am as an enjoyer

[9:26:21] Gahellz: briar - hwei - smolder i think
[9:26:36] erth_tft: no one ever plays Nafiri
[9:26:39] Jakmo: @8succulentia a very short time that she had enough damage and movement speed to be the worth the risk. she's simply far too vulnerable and each new champ can take advantage easier
[9:26:41] jp555jp: That looked fun
[9:26:42] denunciator: can we investigate why you took so long to hit 6 in lane phase
[9:26:54] marinmizuru: I feel like smolder is too slippery for his scaling
[9:26:57] ababababbabaw: ppl def play briar
[9:27:16] Gahellz: Briar ult is kinda sus in high elo
[9:27:21] Thommenius: Briar is played a lot in lower elo, maybe due to litearal ai gaming
[9:27:21] Gahellz: almost never hits
[9:27:42] fauthurs: whos most popular?
[9:28:17] fauthurs: oh wow ty
[9:28:17] flooffd: Yasou/yone also very popular
[9:28:46] denunciator: the R cd helps you be useful more often than once every dragon fight ig
[9:29:01] Gahellz: I would be down to lower briar's ult range and remove the sound effect
[9:29:32] denunciator: can we just skip maokai
[9:29:33] denunciator: LOL
[9:29:44] denunciator: 1/10 for fun, 10/10 for serious go next

[9:30:36] flooffd: Can you try heartsteel/jaksho build on maokai?
[9:30:38] kennekey: that’s 2/3s of ADC picks right there, smolder ez jhin
[9:30:48] denunciator: 60 mana lvl 1 tho
[9:30:52] Thommenius: Maokai is definitely more fun than 1/10 bruh, just mega aggressive bot lane combo
[9:30:53] denunciator: how many times can you cast
[9:31:29] bluegazer1: on ap mao you gotta get mandate/ludens first or you will be perma oom
[9:32:06] bluegazer1: id say its mandate>lucids>liandry, but ludens is a good mandate replacement for lower elo
[9:32:13] flooffd: https://www.op.gg/summoners/euw/Flooffd-EUW Maokai main here
[9:32:15] denunciator: yeah the lvl 1 E mana cost really really hurts

[9:33:09] flooffd: Heartsteel is so fun you should try!

[9:34:44] denunciator: ludens basically
[9:34:48] denunciator: gives 95 right
[9:35:05] bluegazer1: health gives seed duration as well which is noticeable

[9:39:19] bluegazer1: people go swifts+relentless hunter on tank so you dont really need trail/dmp but that seems troll for ap
