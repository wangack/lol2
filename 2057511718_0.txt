[0:37:28] ormuz2235: my lucian so bad, proceeds to carry
[0:37:32] ZedBestSin: Lucian seems like a fantastic counter to yorick though with his passive annihilating his minions insantly
[0:37:34] aangles_: I’m e3 and I’m in hell never seen any worse gameplay ever
[0:37:39] saumrian: you were E2 game 1
[0:37:50] loddenfps: @aangles_ agree
[0:38:06] aangles_: bro it’s worse than bronze
[0:38:12] ZedBestSin: They just need to remove emerald so half of those players drop back to gold
[0:38:12] aangles_: it’s so cursed
[0:38:17] Mounizle: riot just trying to gatekeep me from hitting diamond bro

[0:38:24] Mounizle: wallahi
[0:38:25] saumrian: Im 3 wins from diamond pls Prayge for me
[0:38:32] Eifprinter: people in iron play better than emerald
[0:38:34] Vykosa: ok but have yall been in bronze. what lol
[0:38:35] Ozube: emerald is easy you just pick hyper carry and ppl just throw consistently
[0:38:36] xcollide: what elo was that
[0:38:37] LoLRankBot: Effortless is Challenger  901 LP
[0:38:38] crashwolves: emerald is a mix of previous silver/gold/plat players
[0:39:24] MeleeNewb: is riven playable into bone plating ranged matchups generally speakable or is it just doomed
[0:39:25] hopess_: dont be so hard on yourself, your click was in at least 3 inches of where it was supposed to go
[0:39:27] ox_kiara_xo: @vykosa me lol bronze life ahaha
[0:39:28] ZedBestSin: @Viper Lucian seems like a hard counter to yorick
[0:39:29] ormuz2235: i mean the minion click at the botlane was good to watch ngl
[0:39:32] MeleeNewb: speaking*
[0:39:36] Eifprinter: I could play the game yesterday and I wanted to play asol because he's my boy... and now I dont get to touch the broken asol D:
[0:39:38] anaistashal: Can you fix the map cover? It's a little too far to the left and a little too far down. You can just see top Krugs.
[0:39:43] Eifprinter: couldnt play*
[0:39:46] lemonpuppy: yo
[0:40:08] Ozube: would electrocute work well with your full lethality build vs  ranged champs
[0:40:21] ZedBestSin: you dont need electrocute
[0:40:26] fibonacci022: D
[0:40:28] lemonpuppy: is ghost good against ranges?
[0:40:28] ZedBestSin: you have more than enough dmg with it
[0:40:28] Nightbot: Sub to the stream if you want to see me stream everyday and to support my journey of full time streaming! Thank you and enjoy
[0:40:38] ZedBestSin: without it*
[0:40:40] Eifprinter: @lemonpuppy usually
[0:40:43] Vykosa: @ox_kiara_xo its like no one knows whats going on. its easy to get stuck there and it prob wont be all your fault ya know :/ lol
[0:40:49] Eifprinter: yeah
[0:40:53] loddenfps: -14% dmg
[0:40:55] Eifprinter: he's worse than before
[0:41:17] Eifprinter: @loddenfps thats just w amp, it doesnt matter... the stardust generation got nerfed
[0:41:27] Eifprinter: the stardust is what hurts
[0:41:39] loddenfps: 3-2 is big
[0:41:48] loddenfps: but how would a -14% dmg amp  not matter?
[0:41:49] Eifprinter: they nerfed him to where q start isnt viable anymore
[0:41:55] yaBrad: champ can do anything and they thought buffing every ability was a good idea
[0:41:57] Eifprinter: and his e is worse too
[0:42:12] Eifprinter: I want them to revert asol D:
[0:42:18] Champion_CD: what was your favorite season
[0:42:24] sdw777: there is another reddit post now that shows he's fine
[0:42:30] loddenfps: buff crit items!
[0:42:43] Eifprinter: @sdw777 he's not fine. He is stronger than before but feels worse to play
[0:43:05] cahallo: @Eifprinter how
[0:43:14] ZedBestSin: @Viper you played against humzh top yet? He just hit gm.
[0:43:22] 46chromo: r we talking about illaoi?
[0:43:27] loddenfps: @ZedBestSin nah, really?¡
[0:43:28] Eifprinter: @cahallo because riot forced a playstyle change with him
[0:43:41] ZedBestSin: he was when I checked a few days ago
[0:43:48] ZedBestSin: unless the humzh acc is someone else
[0:43:57] Champion_CD: he has diff acc for top
[0:43:58] cahallo: @Eifprinter what did they do
[0:44:02] ZedBestSin: Ah gotcha
[0:44:09] beastoo9477: i kaisa op _
[0:44:25] JustZekeeeee: 8 mins queu
[0:44:31] ox_kiara_xo: @vykosa I know I'm not the best player but I always do my best for the team, but they often forget its a team game and people tilt so easily and can't get over it and just play
[0:44:38] beastoo9477: whts the build ?
[0:44:54] Eifprinter: @cahallo they moved stardust generation to be mostly on q. His w got nerfed and e got nerfed too but ig q is cheaper mana wise... It forced a mroe trading early playstyle which will make many asol players go 0/10
[0:44:57] ZedBestSin: adc oooof
[0:45:00] loddenfps: adc lmao
[0:45:02] ZedBestSin: Kalista game? Pog
[0:45:06] loddenfps: lucian game?
[0:45:17] cahallo: @Eifprinter Sounds like a huge skill issue
[0:45:28] ormuz2235: riven adc like yesterday
[0:45:28] JustZekeeeee: vayne
[0:45:29] ormuz2235: lets go
[0:45:36] JustZekeeeee: play vayne <3
[0:45:42] Eifprinter: @cahallo I dont play a super scaling pick to trade early and be more matchup dependent
[0:45:59] ox_kiara_xo: vipeCHEER vipeCHEER
[0:46:10] Vykosa: @ox_kiara_xo exaaactly. trying your best and not getting tilted is key but ppl literally dont care lol i hate when someone dies and they just say ff. like bro this is shit elo, we need this practice lmao
[0:46:21] exokind: how come you're playing on this account over your main?
[0:46:25] beastoo9477: hail of blades or letal tempo on kaisa ?
[0:46:48] cahallo: @Eifprinter as a yi main for 8 years I know exactly how you feel
[0:46:55] Vykosa: nah nah, your kaisa is too cuuhlean my boy
[0:47:10] ZedBestSin: Ooh you got a penta yesterday?
[0:47:19] Vykosa: SURELY. hec doesnt camp bot :)
[0:47:29] imibby_: good morning chat how are u guys
[0:47:46] Eifprinter: @cahallo at least with Yi you can play PVE... not so much with Asol now. Your lvl 1 is worse and your lvls 2-5 will just make you int unnecessarily unless youre against melees
[0:47:47] itz_kevun: hi good afternoon viper
[0:48:18] loddenfps: kraken
[0:48:25] loddenfps: kraken navori?
[0:48:34] Vykosa: do you actually prefer terminus on kaisa? like what do you think about it @Viper
[0:48:38] Trelkus: kraken is stronger now?
[0:48:41] Eifprinter: kraken is stronger early now
[0:48:44] CubsAZ: kraken is better early now but worse scaling
[0:48:47] yousri01: Kraken is stronger overall man
[0:48:48] imibby_: do you still go kraken on vayne or not? @viper
[0:48:49] ox_kiara_xo: @vykosa yesssss, seriously , most games in these elo are so winnable even when behind I reckon, I just think some players just do it on purpose 😳,  what server you play on, I'm oce server
[0:48:52] Eifprinter: its super busted on belveth, viego and kindred
[0:48:52] ZedBestSin: @Viper you might get top more if you queue top mid
[0:48:53] CubsAZ: worse when you build a lot of AD
[0:48:55] Eifprinter: and tristana
[0:49:03] yousri01: Its 100% better
[0:49:12] ox_kiara_xo: Goodluck!! vipeCHEER vipeCHEER
[0:49:12] Eifprinter: i like collector kaisa
[0:49:16] Vykosa: wait wtf your chall on this account already? you little crackhead lmao @Viper
[0:49:17] yousri01: Only bad when u go 4 big ad items
[0:49:19] ZedBestSin: Kraken felt so lackluster damage wise for a first item spike
[0:49:20] ormuz2235: look a dead Asol

[1:13:15] ox_kiara_xo: @vykosa yes I totally agree, top and jg for me is a no no lol 😆,  ill mid if I have too and adc, but know one ever wants support they rather try and "carry" but end up feeding 🤦‍♀️if I get autofilled another role, someone is always willing to swap out of support, it's so funny lol, but I always have fun regardless,  otherwise I wouldn't be playing lol even if I'm stuck in bronze life haha
[1:13:27] yousri01: Akshan shits on kalista no?

[1:14:01] ox_kiara_xo: vipeCHEER vipeCHEER
[1:14:32] ZedBestSin: How does kalista do into darius?
[1:14:34] xUnicornGirl: I used to play adc, and swapped to toplane, but i still enjoy playing vayne/kai'sa but don't wanna depend on my supp, so i figured i can start playing them on top :D
[1:14:34] cheezburger11: How come you retired from the lcs even though you're the best player in NA is it because you're so old now ?
[1:14:43] lol_Sol: @cheezburger11 LMAO
[1:14:47] zzzzzz843: bros not even that old LOL
[1:15:08] imibby_: how is vayne vs kennen @viper
[1:15:12] lolkotek: it might just  be my opinion but i feel like a lot of people just don't know either what champs do or the state of the game, regardless of elo.
[1:15:23] Vykosa: @ox_kiara_xo hey, if youre having fun thats all that matters at the end of the day :)

[3:43:44] nxtrl: ur coping so hard viper lmfao
[3:43:50] nxtrl: sona is giga useless even more then zyra
[3:43:51] lolkotek: sona is a heal bot late game lol
[3:44:05] nonexistent303: sona scales far better than zyra
[3:44:08] Sleep_on_Nilou_thighs: after 30mins, sona is a fking cancer man
[3:44:13] klumput: with this much tilt you might become tf blade :D
[3:44:17] klumput: keep it cool
[3:44:19] klumput: stop tilting
[3:44:21] nxtrl: yeah thats fair
[3:44:33] atlanticsunscreen: zyra a walking ward
[3:44:34] nxtrl: i just hate sona from a jungler perspective
[3:44:48] lolkotek: true
[3:44:52] nonexistent303: @atlanticsunscreen a walking ward that gives 300 gold first contact with the enemy
[3:44:58] nxtrl: the worse is ezreal/sona lanes
[3:45:06] nxtrl: and then they complain when i dont gank
[3:45:07] lolkotek: sona used to be the yuumi before there was no yuumi
[3:45:22] atlanticsunscreen: @nonexistent303 truuue giga value it's not even a stealth ward
[3:45:31] Sleep_on_Nilou_thighs: The Tank Man or whatever that guy name was Aware
[3:45:34] aangles_: honestly bro I feel your pain but I don’t think it’s worse than me getting a player named “Ram it Mid” locking in rammus mid and full sprinting it
[3:45:48] nxtrl: theres a challenger sona otp in euw as well @Sleep_on_Nilou_thighs
[3:45:53] nxtrl: kind of goes to show anything can work LUL
[3:46:01] lolkotek: i mean ganking isnt champ based, it's whatever's most beneficial to win
[3:46:04] nxtrl: WHY ARENT YOU CHALLENGER, TWITCH CHAT
[3:46:17] nonexistent303: silver is close enough

[3:46:33] lomeinb: now we have the pdf camille support gonna roam 50 times top surely right guys
[3:46:42] nxtrl: @quincy_chan camille spport hjas been popping up recently
[3:46:46] nxtrl: i think you go eclpse
[3:46:54] nxtrl: and just hit like a truck with the support item that gives damage amp
[3:46:56] nonexistent303: the kayn on the enemy team always gets full build within the first 25 minutes and oneshots the top laner
[3:47:03] atlanticsunscreen: @Viper do you ALWAYS pick riven when it's open or are there exceptions?
[3:47:03] blubbubb: he got hard targeted and went 0/10/0 in the first 15-20 minutes, but didn't say a word, kept farming, by the end of the game he got 18 kills
[3:47:16] blubbubb: and won the game, amazing. their enemy team must have been fuming
[3:47:17] Titania: whats the most kills youve ever gotten in a ranked game with riven?
[3:47:26] nxtrl: pob's got the mentality of the parents of a stripper @blubbubb

[5:18:57] yutipa: pro players have no balls :)

[5:23:38] Arkiro: Greedy ol me would try to get the kill with the ult every time, aiming for the reset
[5:23:47] lomeinb: he doesn’t really try to reset his R often either he kinda just uses it to put them super low
