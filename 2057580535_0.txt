[0:34:11] PrayWMe: !thinking
[0:34:11] Nightbot: Trundle is the ultimate thinking man's champion. No flashy plays, no 100-0 one shots. You only get one chance to place your pillar, so the best Trundle players are calculating to 3 decimal points, and precise down to the millimeter. A pillar barely misplaced to the left can mean only slowing the ADC for 3.793 seconds instead of 4.192, leading to an increase of 376 DPS for the opposing team. This isn't something flashy you clip and show off, this is skill, knowledge, talent at the highest level.
[0:34:14] ghadraa: !irelia
[0:34:14] Nightbot: dont allow her to cs EVER stay on top of minion that shes going to q on and just auto q auto her. When she presses e but does the thing where she doesnt recast until the end FIGHT HER during this time, but the second she recasts you need stop ur auto and dodge it

[1:47:51] ominousfuture35813: + enemy team scaling is actually insane
[1:48:07] twirlypanda: q the 1 hp minion for psychological damage to enemy team
[1:48:12] tayros3: as long as turrets dont scale it dont matter

[1:54:38] Nightbot: (my opinion) after adc takes bot tower they are mid rest of game, mid is in lane closest to upcoming objective, top is in lane farthest. dont group ever just hard pressure so they have to send multiple to match you
