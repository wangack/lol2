[3:28:58] Pheanir: wait, how is Riven on 7 kills?
[3:30:32] YuKiAj_3: lol yone Malding
[3:30:38] Pheanir: @GeneralFury81 so, she's only good against bad players?
[3:31:09] kretarostv: @Pheanir busted means shes always good, no matter what, no matter on the hands of who
[3:31:22] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: @Pheanir she has overloaded kit and if she gets fed by bad players she just wins
[3:32:07] SpringSong: @kretarostv no busted isnt mean that lol
[3:32:12] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: she has 4 dashes one knock up 1 stun a shield and an aoe execute
[3:32:31] Pheanir: in this specific case, I don't think this particular Riven is "fed" thanks to the champ or the player
[3:32:40] kretarostv: @SpringSong busted = broken, overpowered, really strong
[3:33:02] SpringSong: no busted isnt mean that lmfao?
[3:33:33] teils91: I think Terminus is better than Kraken on this build tbh

[3:34:44] Pheanir: ad teemo worked well this game, until yone started malding NotLikeThis
[3:34:53] seigebrisbane: busted = past tense of bust. e.g he busted Kappa
[3:35:02] SpringSong: KEKW
[3:36:19] YuKiAj_3: riven KEKW
[3:36:45] kretarostv: is like when gamers use the term "cracked" they are not using the real meaning at all..
[3:37:50] teils91: Try Terminus instead of Kraken
[3:37:58] YuKiAj_3: tank teemo next game? xd
[3:38:00] theshadowninja89: Champiom designed for AP can't be good AD all the time... AD Teemo was a meta but not now @ipav999

[3:38:22] seigebrisbane: is mobalytics worth using?
[3:38:51] SpringSong: @kretarostv busted champs like riven ksante vlad isnt mean they are op so busted isnt mean overpowered or broken
[3:39:44] Pheanir: @SpringSong what does 'busted' mean, then?
[3:40:53] SpringSong: champs like ksante vlad riven called busted cuz they have all in their kit mobility tankines dmg
[3:40:56] Aldurfus: ipavNoted
[3:41:03] YuKiAj_3: maybe lethal tempo
[3:41:36] 514484: yeah busted means OP
[3:41:53] kretarostv: @SpringSong so you are saying it doesnt mean they are overpowered, it just means they are overpowered?
[3:42:00] SpringSong: nah riven isnt overpowered champ thats not the reason they call busted lol
[3:42:08] kretarostv: xDDD
[3:42:10] 514484: who calls riven busted
[3:42:11] kretarostv: okay dude
[3:42:19] SpringSong: bein op different than bein busted
[3:42:26] Pheanir: So... busted is "very strong", but not 'op'?
[3:42:32] kretarostv: LUL LUL
[3:42:36] kretarostv: this guys logic
[3:42:46] Aldurfus: for real KEKW who cares
[3:42:48] kretarostv: its the same, even Ipav agree
[3:43:14] SpringSong: op and busted difference is gold player with op can 1v9 and gold with busted cant 1v9
[3:43:18] seigebrisbane: recommend to use mobalytics website, or overwatch app?
[3:44:25] Pheanir: op, busted, cracked, sick, insande, broken -- all synonyms of "way too strong" ingame, imo
[3:45:11] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: @ipav999 how do you feel after 3 consecutive nerfs to teemo?

[3:45:38] seigebrisbane: ok thank you sir
[3:45:39] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: 5% to ult 5% to E 10% to Q and they didn't even fix the Q well
[3:46:27] seigebrisbane: if you get mid, who do you play?
[3:46:28] YuKiAj_3: they should add stealth on w like wild rift xd
[3:46:58] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: I would stop playing league if they do so @YuKiAj_3
[3:47:34] Pheanir: I always thought it would be cool for Teemo if his Q narrowed down the player's vision of the screen for its duration, similar to Quinn's Q.
[3:48:45] wingedOracle: the point of teemos q is to counter autos, quinns q is to counter range in general
[3:49:28] Pheanir: @GeneralFury81 yeah, that makes sense
[3:50:06] o_lich: Hallo Ipav Sama!!! :D
[3:51:48] Pheanir: Maybe Teemo should get an initial dash on his W when activated, then. LUL Or would that be a mobility overload?
[3:53:07] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: true
[3:53:20] Pheanir: that would be awesome, true
[3:53:29] o_lich: What if teemo's Q was a skillshot, but it is an area effect?
[3:53:34] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: I would be fine with that, no need anything else for real
[3:54:07] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: yeah so dumb
[3:54:10] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: dumb game
[3:54:21] Pheanir: League of Dashes?
[3:54:35] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: league of 0movementspeed
[3:54:41] seigebrisbane: doodie >_>
[3:54:46] MonoCronic: Dashes last 3 - 4 seasons are ridiculous
[3:54:57] MonoCronic: There are like 3 - 4 champs who came out without a dash
[3:55:57] Pheanir: imagine slows decreasing dash distance LUL that would make some people quit the game for sure
[3:56:16] Oitetment: Reminds me of Kalista's auto jump
[3:56:20] Oitetment: Being affected by slow
[3:57:23] MonoCronic: Just opened up lol champs list, and counted freshly released ones. 5 champs with no dash in FOUR years
[3:57:29] razer_mon: MONKAS
[3:58:00] MonoCronic: 5 out of 18 latest only
[3:58:17] Oitetment: HUH
[3:58:29] Aldurfus: @razer_mon ipavChad
[3:58:41] MonoCronic: And I counted Vex as a no dash champ, cus to dash you need to hit the ult
[3:58:48] Pheanir: I feel like RitoGames doesn't know how to give new champs abilities that can deal with dash-champs other than giving them a dash as well. :/
[3:58:49] kretarostv: idk if we are counting stuff like Lillia in that " no dash" list even though she moves at mach 20
[3:59:12] Aldurfus: @MonoCronic she is anti dash champ lmao (passive)
[3:59:16] MonoCronic: @kretarostv She still can be slowed at least a bit, so yeah, no dash
[3:59:32] razer_mon: @Aldurfus MONKAS ipavChad

[4:44:57] 11Kwah: the fact teems is hated so much makes him a difficult champ to use bc you have a target on your back lol
[4:45:22] Pheanir: @11Kwah the "global taunt" LUL
[4:45:46] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: @ipav999 why don't you put defensive shrooms when riven jumps into you?

[4:52:51] Pheanir: Xerath behaves like a scripter who loses hard despite his scripts. LUL NotLikeThis
[4:53:24] Pheanir: @kretarostv don't forget, the average age of LoL players is still between 22-24 y/o
[4:53:30] 11Kwah: xerath probably gave up his lane
[4:54:01] ELCLAVITOQUECLAVOPABLITO: xerath win trading?
[4:54:42] AnUnknownGold: Riven got quite some healing

[5:06:49] kretarostv: but is Yone mid, no?
[5:07:10] AnUnknownGold: did not see darius
[5:07:48] AnUnknownGold: Maybe Singed will come top, weird champs help each others
[5:11:31] 514484: i hate it so much that people have wards readily available to put in those bushes
[5:11:40] 514484: remove trinkets honestly

[5:30:06] KarmicKnight: isn't this on hit?
[5:30:20] justname: Chatting
[5:32:14] seigebrisbane: @KarmicKnight meant AP on hit,  liadry ect
[5:32:32] seigebrisbane: nashors
[5:33:39] KarmicKnight: I think he's still figuring out builds, they usually pick based on their team though and try to balance ap/ad
[5:33:54] 514484: nashor liandry is'nt really "on-hit"
[5:34:12] 291x: RAGEY bladey
[5:34:14] seigebrisbane: nashors is literally "on-hit"
[5:34:20] 514484: and is the only one in the build
[5:34:30] 514484: building on hit means stacking several on hit items
[5:34:55] KarmicKnight: I mean siege isn't wrong, all AP items for teemo are basically on hit
[5:35:55] AnUnknownGold: at least Singed is doing okay
