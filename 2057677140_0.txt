[2:59:11] pdlemwkci: are we back to diamond yet?
[2:59:12] AkitaAttribute: I saw yorick jungle yesterday.  It's kinda crazy how little dragons did to maiden.
[2:59:13] vsmilotic: yes same with heimer

[2:59:42] JustaStoopidDog: the maiden is actually op as fuck

[3:01:35] 9fierce9: Is that an Ezreal top?

[3:06:42] Tirmel: 5upWave morning chat
[3:06:47] Paper_Man: since u start red they thought u were gonna rotate top and pushed
[3:06:58] Paper_Man: so that fucked all the early game
[3:07:15] youareallsobeutyful: Ezreal autod a ghoul
[3:07:45] psyfi6: the yorick buffs are kinda gross. makes it so much easier to poke and you cant really just straight up fight him
[3:08:33] vsmilotic: LUL
[3:09:28] vsmilotic: KEKW
[3:09:44] NemoB90: didnt yorick just get a buff?
[3:09:55] VengfulDark: 51%
[3:10:09] AkitaAttribute: This guy has a 60% winrate on it, but only 5 games.
[3:10:16] youareallsobeutyful: 51.4in 8 691 games
[3:10:23] psyfi6: back to back legendary midlaners during laning phase
[3:10:24] psyfi6: yikes
[3:10:31] FrozenLavaReflector: Essentially 53%
[3:10:38] minismile_: cryCat
[3:11:10] VengfulDark: Oh Yorik is closer to 53% if you look at all ranks. Which is probably better stats for a simple champ like him
[3:11:49] FrozenLavaReflector: Ifs morr so tye fact that yorick is 53 in emeral pkis which is scary
[3:12:01] Cobiah_: tbf Ezreal just isn't capable of keeping Yorick in check
[3:12:11] hughjanus9001: ez top is troll tho
[3:12:19] VengfulDark: I saw 51, but could be a different site
[3:12:47] AkitaAttribute: Idk if you can even gank bot.  They have so much cc in the other side.
[3:13:28] VengfulDark: could have tried to invade.
[3:13:39] VengfulDark: but even that's not the best idea
[3:13:39] 9fierce9: Why was there a Xin game? just felt like it?
[3:13:46] youareallsobeutyful: Xin jg is not solo queue able... you need a team
[3:13:56] FrozenLavaReflector: Ive seen tundle 1v2 lvl 1
[3:14:18] youareallsobeutyful: The first one was a throw from bot
[3:14:22] FrozenLavaReflector: Trunndle was the one invading there
[3:15:10] youareallsobeutyful: The ezreal top didn't read patch notes
[3:15:14] Iigma_balIs: WideBoris
[3:15:40] NemoB90: not banning yorick?
[3:15:43] hiitsnick: the biggest mistake was queuing up
[3:16:07] Cobiah_: Yorick with Maiden up is scary indeed
[3:16:11] 9fierce9: Pathing was off when bot didnt let shove so you were late for mid
[3:16:37] youareallsobeutyful: Yorick pre maiden is not weak either
[3:16:40] trollingto: Prob not backing off the mid gank a second earlier. Gave kat the hope/greed to tower dive.

[4:04:47] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: So, he's my one rich person. I won't inherit anything, but whenever i had bad health weeks and they heard about it I would get "feel better" cards in the mail with 100-500$ in them. I just wished they didn't stop that when I turned 20. I miss those cards.
[4:04:49] shadowwolfheck: gm gm how goes the games?
[4:04:59] trollingto: I like hot chocolate too but when i order coffee i don't want hot chocolate.

[4:09:04] dudepolo: At least Hugh Januis is on your team
[4:09:33] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: The first two deaths could have been mistake/bad play. That one was just straight running it down.

[4:11:48] whinoot: LoL players
[4:12:02] Jinmav: no one plays for late game anymore these days

[4:17:46] THE_Bacon90: lmfao "0/4" don't talk kass
[4:18:04] whinoot: i love he's talking about stats
[4:18:09] VanTopTV: I know that poppy, he's really good
[4:18:14] BluerBlack: Yaa

[4:18:35] shadowwolfheck: "that's tank life baby"
[4:18:43] whinoot: cause he knows he lost the game so he wants to change it
[4:19:19] THE_Bacon90: negative, just bad teammates
[4:19:26] whinoot: this game no way
[4:19:29] CoCozymandias: league is so toxic
[4:19:30] shadowwolfheck: idk how league works on a strategy level so I can't tell you
[4:19:33] whinoot: i wasnt here for the games before
[4:19:33] tamuna11: nt nt
[4:19:36] VanTopTV: Just a doomed lobby
[4:19:40] SorayaSayo: @shadowwolfheck we‚Äòre ‚Äûunfortunately‚Äú on the channel that misses all the good commands‚Ä¶
[4:19:41] spidertornado: Will you be streaming crab game today ?
[4:19:43] whinoot: they shouldnt have 1v2'd the yas when half health
[4:19:51] Gragnoth: with no winning lanes or good gank opportunities you just farm it up to get strength for when you do have to 1v2
[4:19:51] shadowwolfheck: @SorayaSayo KEKW
[4:19:53] the_godfrog: maybe earlier ganks? Idk i'm a silver a top laner
[4:19:56] whinoot: they're just bad players
[4:20:21] BluerBlack: Yep
[4:20:31] BluerBlack: top died befre he even could gank
[4:20:46] THE_Bacon90: just bad teammates, you're fine
[4:20:49] awscar1: nidalee no jungle item?
[4:20:59] wisla1: I think the only chance that game would have been reading the nida gank at level 3 and being quick on the counter
[4:20:59] BluerBlack: sadly thats the map issue
[4:21:09] wisla1: but yeah rough game not much of a chance
[4:21:13] BluerBlack: their side let for early ganks
[4:21:13] THE_Bacon90: maybe try a more dependent champ? like better gank abilities?
[4:21:18] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[4:21:19] THE_Bacon90: idk, just thinking outloud
[4:21:26] THE_Bacon90: fair fair
[4:21:52] THE_Bacon90: yea, they don't adapt well
[4:22:17] THE_Bacon90: smolder jg? Hmmm
[4:22:18] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I dunno maybe contest their farm? Xin is a pretty good 1v1 champ vs. other junglers. Mostly, just get laners that survive till you are level 3 or 4.
[4:22:19] THE_Bacon90: lol

[4:23:58] Skilletidoo: Kayn is usually broken no?
[4:24:01] EpicTheSuperior: definitely Jax/J4 angle
[4:24:02] BluerBlack: jax is always op right?

[4:24:49] BluerBlack: Fun continues
[4:24:54] BluerBlack: ono
[4:24:57] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: It is possible to not want to play Gragas? Huh, TIL.
[4:24:59] EpicTheSuperior: zac is fun af
[4:25:02] whinoot: tali more fun tho
[4:25:07] whinoot: just blow them up
[4:25:24] whinoot: i dont like gragas either really
[4:25:29] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: But... he does the jiggle slide.
[4:25:30] whinoot: he's real weird to me
[4:25:45] EpicTheSuperior: vayne top? no way this galio goes full ap too right
[4:25:46] africanvalserversplz: play smolder next time
[4:25:53] africanvalserversplz: @5up
[4:25:57] Beemittens: omg ive never seen you play taliyah before
[4:26:04] whinoot: smolder jungle facta
[4:26:04] Skilletidoo: @nospoonsleftonlyknives but what if I'm eating soup??
[4:26:06] whinoot: facts*
[4:26:38] Beemittens: lol why
[4:27:07] OneSmugFrog: I like the earthbender champ
[4:27:17] VengfulDark: Taliyah is really fun to play
[4:27:29] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Yeah, i suppose we haven't tried out smolder jungle yet. It sounds terrible, but who knows.
[4:27:46] VengfulDark: but I like all the most annoying champs
[4:30:19] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @VengfulDark Me too, it's why I like gragas, he's a 1 man bouncy castle. amumu has 2 stuns, a root for mobile teams. Zac is a bouncy POS that never dies. Taliyah breaks fights in half.... man i like a lot of champs.
[4:30:26] VengfulDark: ooo nice still got the assist
[4:30:59] THE_Bacon90: tunnel vision lol
[4:31:07] 9fierce9: You simply threw my good sir
[4:31:13] briweb11: how‚Äôs league going today
[4:31:26] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: If you played Xin they would have bitched about being too aD heavy, tilted off the side of the world and lose the game.
[4:31:45] whinoot: true
[4:32:15] EpicTheSuperior: taliyah is so much nicer to play since rework, I hated her prior, was just boring
[4:32:33] VengfulDark: I love Ivern, Lulu, Bard.
[4:33:15] Quaigon_Twitch: hi 5up
[4:33:19] Quaigon_Twitch: hows it going?
[4:33:22] VengfulDark: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives along with things like Qiyana, where you just are the most annoying assassin
[4:33:31] EpicTheSuperior: thoughts on Briar‚Äôs tankier rework?!
[4:33:56] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @VengfulDark I suck at Ivern, but bard and lulu are fun. I like playing the "What random angle can I get you from with my poke this time" game on people.
[4:34:54] VengfulDark: I don't play Ivern very often because he feels bad to play in solo queue
[4:35:02] VengfulDark: Even when he's strong
[4:35:15] whinoot: oh god
[4:37:07] Quaigon_Twitch: clean 0-3 .. thats gg top
[4:37:25] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: When you figure it out, let me know. Lack of W consistency is why i don't play her.
[4:37:32] minismile_: this song yasss
[4:37:49] OldestDreamer: this is painful
[4:37:51] BluerBlack: LUL

[4:48:08] BluerBlack: ww should be easier with his cc ulti
[4:48:20] VengfulDark: Oh I just looked AP Xin looks fine. Still a .65 AP ratio on heal along with a 2.2AP ratio on his full combo
[4:48:20] BluerBlack: Just an option for you if you want
[4:48:57] OldestDreamer: oh

[4:55:22] jolly_does_art: how is the emotion controlling going today?
[4:55:24] BluerBlack: ww should be easier
[4:55:30] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I think your early game is a bit weak. Xin is usually pretty aggressive level 2 onward.

[4:58:39] saaba123: Thats inspired from the japanese vtuber/idol industry right? I really dislike those orgs and companys who does this type of stuff
[4:58:44] XortedI: yi ew
[4:58:52] renziboss: wait are we still on xin?
[4:58:58] Joker_GGEZ: none of this sounds great
[4:58:58] Tirmel: @renziboss 5upLUL all good, I only learned about them last year
[4:59:00] XortedI: hopefully they int
[4:59:01] Joker_GGEZ: yeah it's very kpop
[4:59:06] Joker_GGEZ: esp w the branding policies
[4:59:07] dudepolo: dragon main!
[4:59:13] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I mean, I think it's nuts to sign a contract like that, but if it's the only way in for them or they thought it was worth it... cool?
[4:59:23] renziboss: @tirmel :)
[4:59:24] Joker_GGEZ: aren't you in an org
[4:59:26] balletbunny: YEP
[4:59:30] balletbunny: and org is not the same
[4:59:32] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Like as long as the contract wasn't predatory then.. they took a risk and lost.
[4:59:32] Joker_GGEZ: o
[4:59:34] Tirmel: @Joker_GGEZ orgs typically also help in that they give managers who help with the legal stuff/ create projects but Nijji screwed up big time
[4:59:43] divax0x0: He was but he isn't anymore
[4:59:44] Joker_GGEZ: I see
[4:59:58] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: League orgs still employ a decent amount of streamers.
[5:00:06] balletbunny: youd be posting an apology every week if you were in a vtuber org om
[5:00:18] Joker_GGEZ: saying your talent is expendable when they're the ones keeping you going is insane
[5:00:25] divax0x0: He'd be fired day one
[5:00:30] Tirmel: They fired one of the top EN Vtubers and then put out a statement to their stakeholder saying that it wound't effect revenue at all
[5:00:32] renziboss: @nospoonsleftonlyknives yup
[5:00:42] balletbunny: YesYes
[5:00:49] BluerBlack: if you are going to be vtuber be furry vtuber
[5:00:56] Joker_GGEZ: oh so they think their stakeholders are dumb too
[5:00:57] BluerBlack: you get one moregroup
[5:01:00] BluerBlack: in free
[5:01:02] balletbunny: 5ups a scaley
[5:01:05] saaba123: Vshojo is the only one i like because they dont own the models and identity
[5:01:06] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I mean, if they own the identity their talent IS expendable to a certain extent. They are less a streamer personality and more a person with specific qualities working a job. If you are just a person working a job you are ALWAYS expendable. I don't like it, but it's the truth of the world right now.
[5:01:07] VengfulDark: Phase Connect has talked about how they do things, and they are pretty upfront about their pro's and cons
[5:01:14] renziboss: üêº
[5:01:21] saaba123: Im not much into vtubers tho
[5:01:28] Joker_GGEZ: spoons that's an insane angle lol
[5:01:38] benathanael: !rank
[5:01:38] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond I 96 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[5:01:43] Joker_GGEZ: this is not a hill you want to go down on
[5:01:52] VengfulDark: Wouldn't 5up just be an Amongus with wolf ears and tail?
[5:02:04] VengfulDark: or one of the little plant guys
[5:02:06] ChimeZee: does 5up willigly play xin now ?
[5:02:06] balletbunny: imagine if they just replace the vtuber with a diff person same model Aware horror story
[5:02:08] superfreak123: holy
[5:02:13] 9fierce9: yes
[5:02:13] balletbunny: awful image üò≠üò≠üò≠
[5:02:13] Joker_GGEZ: well yes!
[5:02:18] Komar95_: om\
[5:02:22] divax0x0: I wasn't gonna say it
[5:02:25] Tirmel: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives I'd argue the whole Selen  situation shows that that's not true -- so many people have jumped ship and are supporting her as Doki
[5:02:26] toytrainsgoburr: 5upL
[5:02:27] VengfulDark: He still hasn't won on Xin
[5:02:37] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ I wasn't aware we were fighting to death over something.
[5:02:37] balletbunny: üíÄ
[5:02:38] 9fierce9: Also fair
[5:02:45] Joker_GGEZ: it's an expression
[5:02:53] renziboss: @vengfuldark it‚Äôs been hours üòê
[5:02:57] BluerBlack: @Joker_GGEZ Not really, if you look at it CEO is the easiest position to be replaced by AI
[5:02:58] Joker_GGEZ: dw you are not actually putting your life on the line
[5:03:01] ChimeZee: @VengfulDark well i managed to get a good nap in the meantime haha
[5:03:11] Joker_GGEZ: true! and I'd love to replace all CEOs with AIs
[5:03:11] saaba123: Yeah
[5:03:11] Quaigon_Twitch: AP XIN rooPog
[5:03:17] neonpaintedpigeons: 5upWave 5upWave
[5:03:20] VengfulDark: I'm mostly making fun of you 5up. One of these guys would look better for you TBH 5upWave 5upWave 5upL 5upHi
[5:03:20] Fossabot: 5upL 5upL 5upL
[5:03:26] Joker_GGEZ: but actual talent isn't really replaceable
[5:03:30] Tirmel: @Joker_GGEZ The only good use for AI /j
[5:03:30] renziboss: @chimezee I made some food , did some work n he‚Äôs still on this champ
[5:03:36] Joker_GGEZ: and it's def not a message you wanna send to your talent
[5:03:36] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives Yeah, because they let her become a person outside the character. If they are going to do what they are doing-which i don't like and wish they wouldn't- they should have locked it down harder. If no one knew who Selen was, then firing and replacing them wouldn't be a big deal.
[5:03:44] Skilletidoo: 345 is quite yikes
[5:03:50] Joker_GGEZ: PIGEON
[5:03:53] ChimeZee: @renziboss thats tragic haha i hope the food was good :p
[5:04:05] neonpaintedpigeons: JOKER 5upFlower
[5:04:05] Fossabot: 5upFlower 5upFlower 5upFlower
[5:04:11] Joker_GGEZ: is Athena a snake
[5:04:16] renziboss: @chimezee delicious üòã
[5:04:23] VengfulDark: Oh a weird Xin tech. If you hit your W it increases E range
[5:04:50] neonpaintedpigeons: Bro I still don't know who Athena is
[5:05:12] Skilletidoo: I feel like you never have a good Irelia on your team.
[5:05:28] Joker_GGEZ: üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
[5:05:49] Tirmel: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives I think that the person makes the character -- like, the company may own the IP but it is the 'actor' that really makes them and draws people in. If someone else were to stream here, chat would immediately notice/be upset (assuming it's not a bit). In other industries I totally agree with you, but Vtubing is so specific that the talent is the appeal
[5:06:04] benathanael: I love this album
[5:06:05] VengfulDark: Irelia knew to stack her passive at least @Skilletidoo
[5:06:26] Joker_GGEZ: the actor also 100% matters
[5:06:27] neonpaintedpigeons: Ohh,,
[5:06:30] Skilletidoo: @vengfuldark very fair
[5:06:53] Joker_GGEZ: oh is that why you didn't end up doing that apex tour
[5:06:56] Tirmel: 5up not Niji approved confirmed /j
[5:06:57] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: In my opinion, those kinds of vtuber contracts are like the difference between tv/movies and theatre. Theatre actors change and no one freaks out, TV actors change and shows die. I'm not saying this applies to all VTubers, just the ones in these specific types of contracts. Certainly not something that applies to streamers as a whole.
[5:06:57] Joker_GGEZ: crazy stuff
[5:07:22] Joker_GGEZ: what
[5:08:51] VengfulDark: Draven should have come to dragon to maybe bait the river fight.
[5:08:58] Tirmel: peepoShrug We'll just agree to disagree Spoons
[5:09:37] ashbunnnie_: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives scripted acting and improv acting are very different in this context
[5:10:21] Tirmel: All good -- we're all on the same side in that regard
[5:10:33] VengfulDark: oh easy dive top
[5:10:37] VengfulDark: maybe
[5:10:40] Joker_GGEZ: that makes more sense
[5:11:21] Skilletidoo: Sigh....
[5:11:53] neonpaintedpigeons: 5upDance 5upDance
[5:11:54] BluerBlack: I think we will see more and more actors and celebrities just selling their looks for ai
[5:12:22] BluerBlack: Like why you have to be at the set when you can just face swap someone else and take money for that...
[5:12:28] Tirmel: @BluerBlack Nah, from what I see all types of artists are anti-AI
[5:12:48] Fossabot: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives, Your message was too long! [warning]
[5:13:14] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[5:13:17] BluerBlack: Essaying
[5:13:22] Joker_GGEZ: eh personality is less them and moreso their spin on what it's supposed to be
[5:13:26] Joker_GGEZ: like that I understand
[5:13:33] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Well, then they are signing a semi-predatory contract and fuck those companies and i misunderstood how it worked on a fundamental level.
[5:13:36] Tirmel: Yeah, for vtubing the personality is the streamer. They have a 'persona' but it typically is just "I'm a mystical creature -- rwar!"
[5:13:42] VengfulDark: @Tirmel I've seen Musician's be pro AI but Musician's are weirdo's who are pro everything
[5:13:46] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[5:13:53] Joker_GGEZ: Tirmel has said those words irl before
[5:14:08] Joker_GGEZ: JKJK
[5:14:08] Tirmel: @Joker_GGEZ Excuse me?? What kind of attack is this???
[5:14:11] Joker_GGEZ: LMAOOO
[5:14:27] neonpaintedpigeons: LOL
[5:14:49] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I was under the impression that in these specific types of VTuber companies you were handed a persona rather than just a character model. If it's just the model then yeah, this is fucked up.
[5:15:01] renziboss: Travis
[5:15:13] balletbunny: NotLikeThis
[5:15:25] THE_Bacon90: DinoDance
[5:15:36] Tirmel: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives It's just the model. People audition and then they either get handed a model or are given say into what the model looks like (depending on the agency) and then they bring that character to life
[5:16:08] neonpaintedpigeons: They audition??
[5:16:10] VengfulDark: There are companies that will be IT, send computers ect.
[5:16:22] Tirmel: @neonpaintedpigeons Yeah, they have to go through an interview and everything
[5:16:25] VengfulDark: set everything up, but then the personality is the person
[5:16:35] neonpaintedpigeons: Woahh
[5:16:39] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives Ok, then yeah, these companies are preying on desperate talent and that is fucked up. They should really have optionality to buy out to IP in installments over time or something so something like this doesn't happen.
[5:17:07] VengfulDark: it all depends on the company you go to,
[5:17:11] BluerBlack: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives Sure
[5:17:11] Tirmel: Some companies do let people keep the IPs, others don't
[5:17:27] ashbunnnie_: what does IP stand for here
[5:17:42] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Tirmel I thought it was more like an audition for a traditional gig. Where they have a character fully fleshed out and look for the best fit to play that character. Then them owning it all would make sense.
[5:17:43] Tirmel: @ashbunnnie_ Intellectual Property -- it basically says this person has the copyright over it
[5:17:57] ashbunnnie_: @Tirmel ahh okay thanks
[5:18:13] BluerBlack: LUL
[5:18:18] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @ashbunnnie_ intellectual property. Who owns the essence/idea of a thing legally speaking.
[5:18:30] VengfulDark: literally the same items.
[5:18:38] Tirmel: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives Some companies do have a model designed (mainly so that they have have a 'theme' when the group debuts), but the character's personality is mainly whatever the streamer wants
[5:19:17] pennant5: Wait, do companies recast Vtubers?
[5:19:33] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives Gotcha, well, i rescind all previous statements as my assumptions were faulty and this is a predatory business model that needs adjusting or abolishment.
[5:19:35] Tirmel: @pennant5 No. They get terminated or 'graduate' (they quit)
[5:19:36] VengfulDark: not from what I've seen
[5:19:51] balletbunny: thatd be dystopian as hell if they recasted them
[5:20:00] balletbunny: monkaS
[5:20:11] lil__soupy: still trying to win a zin game?
[5:20:27] pennant5: Ok. That makes more sense but still messed up.
[5:20:29] Tirmel: A good agency will work like a manager -- help them get sponsors, help with getting the legal rights to certain things
[5:20:42] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Tirmel @Joker_GGEZ My bad, I have strong feelings about "actions have consequences" and "know what you are getting into" and my very limited reading into the subject gave me some incorrect assumptions. I was wrong.
[5:20:52] hiitsnick: spooky engages
[5:20:54] Tirmel: No worries Spoons!
[5:21:53] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Diamond is where people with mechanical skill and no macro ability go to stagnate forever.
[5:22:25] VengfulDark: Yeah your ult is a knock up
[5:22:37] ashbunnnie_: crazy how i just witnessed a mature and intellectual discussion on twitch chat
[5:22:40] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: It does, your Q3 and ult are knockups.
[5:23:03] xxKnowledgerxx: rammus would be such a fun jungle for them
[5:23:07] wby13: What song is this
[5:23:22] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @ashbunnnie_ Welcome to the good side of Twitch.
[5:23:44] xxKnowledgerxx: @ashbunnnie_ dont get too used to it
[5:23:45] VengfulDark: i kinda wish Ult knocked the person you are targeting up instead of just leaving them alone
[5:24:28] ashbunnnie_: @xxKnowledgerxx i wont om especially not in a league stream KEKW

[7:35:35] VVIZRRD: @maverickx29 Probaby gets the fastest stacks mid.
[7:36:40] AkitaAttribute: Oh shit!  Your E negates his chicken thing I think because smolder faces the enemy champ when he flys
[7:36:48] VVIZRRD: E escape is a great counter to Tryn's engage.
[7:36:51] AkitaAttribute: Not the damage reduction, but the slow
[7:38:02] Tirmel: I just now realized that there was a little merchant hanging out at the spawn point
