[1:47:56] finestwhines: I know you don’t have mic on. but do you think youmoos and collector are still viable after patch? on graves
[1:48:52] cnebelung: He said yes. I am telepathically linked with him.
[1:48:53] JimElements: That rumble out just coming out off CD
[1:49:43] cnebelung: The Roman empire was amazing
[1:49:50] cnebelung: Sorry, that was Santorin's thought.
[1:50:02] Dracziek: bro
[1:50:07] Dracziek: what are these teams you're getting
[1:50:26] VizeReZ: blessed freedom
[1:50:31] Soff199: these games dude
[1:50:36] PineappleCoco: wideVIBE
[1:51:04] Santorin: What in the world are these games
[1:51:06] kataxxx: slap af nogle hold du har haft :D
[1:51:22] Dracziek: it seems like you play out of your mind while your teammates are just diddling off in lane
[1:51:39] mrfaffen: Ksante feels like.. completely op
[1:51:48] trespasur: mr Santorini Ive been having some bad smites lately, whats a good/ consistent way to practice smiting?
[1:51:53] kristykat_: ur getting the team mates Kels had the past couple days KEKW
[1:51:54] d1a_lol: losers queue Kappa
[1:52:03] VizeReZ: one day Ksante will get balanced.
[1:52:14] VizeReZ: ... right?
[1:52:18] d1a_lol: @Santorin does it hurt having removed your wisdom teeth?
[1:52:30] d1a_lol: it must feel weird
[1:52:35] Santorin: @trespasur do you think it stems off of reaction time? If so, you could try some of those reaction time games on google, else its just keep smiting and try to focus on smiting with abilities/spells wihch makes it a bit easier
[1:52:37] BurritoTX: yeah post rework lol
[1:52:43] Santorin: Yeah my chin hurts a lot rn
[1:52:45] moelast: match hist looking SUSS
[1:52:57] Santorin: And I cant eat anything solid, so my stomach is santorinFine
[1:53:01] d1a_lol: Sadge @Santorin hope you get well asap!
[1:53:16] Soff199: oh no, so only soups? for how long? BibleThump
[1:53:17] VizeReZ: @d1a_lol it does for a bit. some meds to manage shortly after and for about a month following it is uncomfy. then it gets back to normal.
[1:53:22] d1a_lol: LUL i remember back when i removed mine i lived on yogurt for a good while
[1:53:34] klingeron: I didnt eat anything but meda for 2 days
[1:53:37] klingeron: Meds*
[1:53:41] klingeron: Not a good idea
[1:53:49] Santorin: I cant fathom that was a challenger/gm lobby we just played in
[1:53:54] klingeron: Sgomach oain was worse than the teeth in the end
[1:54:01] BurritoTX: ibuprofen was a god send
[1:54:05] VizeReZ: I am lactose intolerant so the yogurt diet post teeth removal was the worst.
[1:54:05] JuijitsuChicken: Top will be AD TF for sure
[1:54:10] Santorin: And yeah its the same for me, my stomach is a hell but my teeth pain is whatever
[1:54:12] finestwhines: tf top that sounds fun
[1:54:34] Santorin: Surely this game will be better :D
[1:54:37] klingeron: Those meds are stressful for the stomach if u dont eat
[1:54:38] VizeReZ: Im in the US so they just gave me vicodin. but they also fuged my stuff up
[1:54:50] shadow7master: ohh no the tf game again
[1:54:55] n33dl3z: i'm sure you wont die if you eat regular food
[1:55:02] d1a_lol: you guys got meds? i didnt get or use any meds Weirdge
[1:55:10] n33dl3z: just chew softly
[1:55:16] klingeron: Its not hard to get infections
[1:55:26] klingeron: Soup helps avoid it
[1:55:36] klingeron: No pieces that can get shuck from chewing
[1:55:42] VizeReZ: @n33dl3z no. food gets into the stitches and it will cause an infection.
[1:55:46] klingeron: My brother had a small infection
[1:56:04] klingeron: Needs to be flushed
[1:56:14] d1a_lol: depends though, i remember my dentist placed antibiotic-added bandage to the wound after its removal. as long u keep your mouth hydrated(drinking water regularly) it should be fine
[1:56:16] JuijitsuChicken: Mid asks if top is AD, top says yes, then mid still picks an AD champ??
[1:56:23] shadow7master: soups and much potato will be fine
[1:56:27] d1a_lol: @klingeron yea for sure, needs to b flushed etc
[1:56:34] VizeReZ: You just need to wait out healing. I couldnt even play my trumpet for a month and a half after and im a musician.
[1:56:52] Santorin: Damn a month and a half?!
[1:56:57] Santorin: Thats ridiculous
[1:57:05] Santorin: and yeah idk, i think in a couple of days everything is back to normal
[1:57:17] MouldyCheesePie: Santorino thoughts on new tierlist? Brand big nerfs and Lillia mild nerfs?
[1:57:20] VizeReZ: cant dry out the sockets while they heal.
[1:57:20] Santorin: just gotta make sure I dont get baited to do something stupid santorinQ
[1:57:22] d1a_lol: that poor trumpet, a month and a half without getting blown Sadge
[1:57:30] klingeron: I also killed my entire gut bacteria with the ibuprofen and no food combo
[1:57:35] Santorin: Brand is still good
[1:57:38] Santorin: Lillia not so much
[1:57:42] VizeReZ: @d1a_lol dont worry, she gets plenty now that im back
[1:57:44] Santorin: from what I could tell from watching other ppl play
[1:57:50] Santorin: I havent played enough myself yet (0 games on either so far)
[1:57:51] d1a_lol: @VizeReZ KEKW
[1:57:52] MouldyCheesePie: Really? I thought Brand was hard nerfed and Lillia only tapped
[1:57:53] klingeron: Probiotics saved it
[1:57:56] n33dl3z: i've had my wisdom teeth removed twice. just chew like a dog
[1:58:25] shadow7master: @n33dl3z built diffrent
[1:58:43] solidussovis: what a waste of time. Anyone else have to sit in meetings where people just boast about all the great nothing they do
[1:59:02] solidussovis: I see the game did not get better
[1:59:04] BurritoTX: Lillia is my favorite champ. i hope she is atleast still decent.
[1:59:05] d1a_lol: i find it oddly comforting so many of us are wisdom tooth veterans
[1:59:12] d1a_lol: this song is PogU
[1:59:24] shadow7master: @solidussovis morning COPIUM
[1:59:46] solidussovis: @shadow7master agreed

[2:00:18] solidussovis: @Santorin Sorry Santo I can't lie. So I will just boast about how great you are
[2:00:23] Santorin: Idk why enemy team drafts so good vs us and we draft like we are playing urf

[3:17:55] Adalsvans: is it still less then NA in Denmark atleast?
[3:18:04] Dezrunner: Huzzah!
[3:18:21] Whitizi: Santorin oh shit really? what you pay? my 2 will be 3.4k USD after everything
[3:18:31] Santorin: Oh jesus okay
[3:18:33] Santorin: nvm i stop talking
[3:18:34] DaveSnow: @Santorin Are dentists also not covered as "healthcare" in denmark, just like in Norway? Dentist visits makes me a poor man
[3:18:36] Santorin: US is gapping
[3:18:36] Whitizi: LMAO
[3:18:39] Dezrunner: Did all your fears or anxiety around it get put to shame, or how did you make it through?
[3:18:42] shadow7master: KEKW
[3:18:49] Santorin: To be fair though, we dont get put under fully
[3:18:52] Santorin: and that stuff is expensive here too
[3:19:01] Whitizi: ahh yeah i think mine so expensive cause they impacted
[3:19:03] Whitizi: so its like. more
[3:19:18] Whitizi: idfk man its all a scam LULW
[3:19:31] Dezrunner: No, dentists are not seen as public health care in Denmark, wierdly enough
[3:19:39] Santorin: Yeah I made it through but it wasnt too good before the surgery
[3:19:51] shadow7master: @Whitizi u get taxed for every move xdd
[3:19:56] Dezrunner: I'm sorry man... i feel you all the way, trust
[3:20:10] DaveSnow: @Dezrunner That sucks, just the same here sadly, but could be worse iguess
[3:20:23] Santorin: Guys why do I have to pay someone to take my teeth out? xdd
[3:20:29] Whitizi: LMAO
[3:20:30] Whitizi: TRUE
[3:20:30] Santorin: In the movies they always do that shit for free
[3:20:48] Santorin: 'torture' they say..
[3:20:51] Dezrunner: @DaveSnow I guess, so many health issues can be related to bad teeth.. so it seems wierd, no?
[3:21:16] shadow7master: @Santorin do u hv your tooth or they took it xdd
[3:21:16] Adalsvans: luckily here in sweden we get free dental care till 23 then we have to pay
[3:21:30] Dezrunner: I don't even wanna think about how much money i've spent on dentists man... could have had a nice little car i think
[3:21:36] Santorin: They had to cut it in small pieces to get it out, so unfortunately I cant put it under my bed for another win on the rift
[3:21:38] Dezrunner: makes me cry
[3:21:43] Santorin: under my pillow(
[3:21:49] Whitizi: santorin LMAO

[3:22:27] Whitizi: solid lmfao
[3:22:30] Dezrunner: Just "bad parenting" you know... when you're never taught proper dental care, its gonna cost ya
[3:22:38] Adalsvans: Adalsvans subscribed with Prime.

[3:23:24] Whitizi: Dezrunner bro i legit brush my kids teeth every night for her because of my tooth problems
[3:23:24] Santorin: Honestly why not just get all their teeth removed
[3:23:25] Santorin: sounds cheaper
[3:23:28] tugwos: I broke a tooth playing soccer and had to have it pulled out on Wed.  Sound almost exactly the same.  I'm feeling you!  Get well soon
[3:23:28] Whitizi: aint no way she getting that shit
[3:23:37] Dezrunner: @shadow7master Yep, and add a couple REALLY traumatic trips to the dentist, that scared me the fk away

[3:24:11] Santorin: Oh damn Tug, hope ur doing well
[3:24:15] Adalsvans: it is we get free dental till 23 then it gets exspensive
[3:24:18] Dezrunner: @Santorin Tru, dental is free till 18 hahaha. Pull them all!
[3:24:26] Santorin: Yeah we have till 18
[3:24:33] Santorin: but the doctors told me i was too young to get the wisdomsteeth out
[3:24:38] Whitizi: AD MID LETSFUCKING GO
[3:24:39] DaveSnow: @Dezrunner For sure, it's been talked about in Norway quite some years now to have it included, but nothing so far. Feels bad for the ones who can't afford to pay, teeth related pain are some of the worst.
[3:24:39] Whitizi: BRAND BABY

[3:48:45] Burgerbrater1702: whats ur opinion of viego new patch
[3:48:50] Santorin: Viego is pretty solid
[3:48:54] madham99: I played belveth into brand and he out farmed me 50 to 100 at 12 mins. what champs can beat him?
[3:48:58] xLippyy: Well ggs I'm going back to work. Glgl
[3:49:06] Dezrunner: Chat demands something to do with Santorinis
[3:49:06] solidussovis: Using that positive energy to get the streak going. Love to see it Santo
[3:49:09] Santorin: Gl lippy
[3:49:13] Dezrunner: 10 pushups for 2K :P
[3:49:16] Santorin: Uh I mean brand is still really strong
[3:49:20] Santorin: but i could definitely feel the nerfs a bit
[3:49:26] Whitizi: santorin would you ever do a unranked to chal account for funsies? say you hit rank 1
[3:49:27] blueknight0007: 3-0!
[3:49:29] Santorin: Generally belveth is a stronger early game champ so u can maybe take advantage of that
[3:49:46] Santorin: I am not allowed to do pushups currently
[3:49:49] Santorin: doctors order
[3:49:49] Burgerbrater1702: lillia got a rly big hit imo
[3:49:50] Santorin: xdding
[3:50:01] Santorin: Whitizi yeah prob at some point for sure
[3:50:01] solidussovis: Brand burns don't seem to hit has hard
[3:50:04] Dezrunner: Dont worry, if you tried, your mouth would tell you to stop :P
[3:50:17] Santorin: Yeah definitely weaker but still powerful santorinFine
[3:50:35] Dezrunner: but we still want something to do with Santorini's... like : 15K for a run round the neighbourhood shouting "røv røv røv" the whole way :P
[3:50:57] madham99: I try to invade but since he just perma farmed, so I said let me get obj and then it's fun when their laners are defending dragon when brand is on his topside camps...
[3:50:57] Santorin: santorinLUL
[3:51:00] solidussovis: He isn't shouting anything for a few more days at least
[3:51:22] Santorin: Yeah its not easy to punish brand
[3:51:25] Santorin: One thing you can do in that matchup is
[3:51:28] Santorin: Level 1 invade his raptors potentially
[3:51:29] Dezrunner: at his pace, its prolly gonna take him a couple days to add anyways :P
[3:51:30] Santorin: since ur a lot stronger
[3:51:35] madham99: oh ur not going terminus on belveth?
[3:51:36] Santorin: but its a bit of a flip depending on team situation
[3:51:45] Dezrunner: taking advantage of him not being able to talk right now haha
[3:51:48] Santorin: nah I go kraken stride into other beefy items
[3:52:12] solidussovis: I have been playing Blue Kayn vs Brand. It seems pretty solid
[3:52:19] madham99: makes sense since in high elo they know to shut down a belveth before she resets
[3:52:24] Santorin: Oh yeah kayn seems fun, gotta try my hands on that at some point
[3:52:33] shadow7master: @Dezrunner i wonder if kaypea trolled him or still xdd
[3:52:42] solidussovis: Red kayn feels bad compared to blue honestly
[3:52:46] koushik_10: bro i am hating soloq so much past ew days
[3:52:50] koushik_10: it is so horrible
[3:52:51] Dezrunner: @shadow7master i hope so
[3:53:05] Santorin: yo bard looks weak
[3:53:07] Santorin: thoughts?
[3:53:09] Santorin: xdding
[3:53:22] koushik_10: ya he is fine
[3:53:26] koushik_10: not that op
[3:53:30] n33dl3z: bard is overrated
[3:53:33] solidussovis: I was about to say he looks strong to me. Nice Troll santo
[3:53:36] koushik_10: but moakai is still op
[3:53:39] shadow7master: yeah bard seems balanced kapp
[3:53:44] madham99: I pray for a frozen heart nerf, every game I'm adc there is a naut/bard rushing it
[3:53:50] Iamaf33d3r: Santorin looks different
[3:53:57] Whitizi: lmao
[3:53:58] n33dl3z: he wins more on maokai
[3:54:01] Santorin: @Iamaf33d3r its what happens to u if u feed
[3:54:02] solidussovis: He got glasses
[3:54:04] Santorin: so u better be careful
[3:54:12] solidussovis: and the wisdom tooth surgery swolled his face
[3:54:19] Burgerbrater1702: do u always prefer starting red with brand if u play vs aggressive early jgl who wants to invade?
[3:54:21] Santorin: OH
[3:54:22] Santorin: ur talking about
[3:54:24] Santorin: lathyrus

[5:02:45] bobbybobsen4201: @Santorin ylove ya <3
[5:02:55] Azucrias: If i like playing both fiddle and eve, in which draft scenarios should i pick one over the other? Or would you pick them in the same situations @santorin
[5:03:18] crecentbear: omg
[5:03:28] crecentbear: every single loss had an ace
[5:03:32] Santorin: Hmm I think eve is a better champ than fiddle right now
[5:03:41] Santorin: but usually I would say fiddle with winning matchups is nice
[5:03:45] Santorin: cus then u can just sit behind ur winning lanes
[5:03:55] Santorin: whereas if ur eve ur better at picking off ppl so if u have losing lanes its easy to shut them down
[5:04:05] bobbybobsen4201: is this an AI game we are watchin?
[5:04:32] Santorin: This is one of the goated kayles
[5:04:36] crecentbear: no just streamer who covered names
