[0:41:29] reeiaa: eepy
[0:41:29] xcalebur: honestly hexplate seems like the worst item in the game
[0:41:38] Bolbi_LoL: @Jackspektra But if they change Kraken in current patch and buff Terminus, correct build doesn't change still (Kraken, Terminus, Guinsso on Kai Sa)?
[0:42:04] FreshCoolILikeIt: we should standardise not leashing on euw in every Elo tbh‚Ä¶ fcks laners so hard
[0:43:06] Electrooxd: @xcalebur Nocturne uses it well, but he's probably the only one it feels like xd

[0:52:36] Pallysftw91: rip Xerath/Cassio scripter Prayge
[0:53:05] heaven_trampler: @Pallysftw91 was previously communicated in the 14.2 notes that we will be introducing Vanguard, Riot‚Äôs proprietary anti-cheat software that will be required for all League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics games. However, this change has been rescheduled due to some critical bugs with the client pop up we planned to have in 14.2 which caused us to delay one patch cycle. So starting in patch 14.3, we will run a diagnostics check to see if your computer is ready for this update. If not, please rev
[0:53:29] Pallysftw91: NODDERS good
[0:53:32] heaven_trampler: They plan it for 14.4 or 14.5

[1:56:42] jinzosann: shhh boosted
[1:56:49] Sebi1747: Jack can we get a diagnosis on the Xerath?
[1:56:51] ADCPurple: shieldbow soraka 0 anti heal is pure comedy
[1:56:56] MikuChan1998: also has seraphs on xerath
[1:56:58] MikuChan1998: sounds
[1:57:03] MikuChan1998: giga dogass
[1:57:13] MikuChan1998: needs malignance or ludens
[1:57:22] MikuChan1998: but nah he has both
[1:57:23] MikuChan1998: AHAHA
[1:57:25] Baltamutus: he's not boosted he's just mastapeaker
[1:57:29] MikuChan1998: he's just r word
[1:58:07] rases00: isn't orb better? you can proc GW with ability effects like passive and W-R
[1:58:28] ADCPurple: yeah I dont know exe seems bad
[1:58:35] yumichai: i love how u just get every kill once u hit 225 stacks
[1:58:37] ADCPurple: exe procs on auto q only
[1:58:37] sandcrema: how much % is the execute?
[1:58:38] yumichai: its kind of satisfying
[1:58:45] ADCPurple: orb will proc on w, q and R
[1:58:56] violcncc: omg
[1:58:57] MikuChan1998: Jack, tell Xerath who you are, please he needs getting put in his place
[1:59:12] Saderako: aren't smolder ap scalings shit
[1:59:13] violcncc: x.x
[1:59:26] StreamElements: Enjoying the stream? Follow me on other platforms for more content! https://linktr.ee/jackspektra
[1:59:28] ADCPurple: you're right im just R word
[1:59:39] aoketai: w has 100 percent ap
[1:59:55] rases00: orb should proc on ability type damage, unless it has been changed with 14.1
[2:00:09] ADCPurple: I dont know why i thought exe only procs on autos not just PD
[2:00:14] rases00: so even your true damage passive or mask
[2:00:15] Piksol_LoL: I tried this with trinity 4th I think, it felt so bad compared to crit:(
[2:00:35] xamacslol: i guess it extends on liandries once u complete it
[2:00:48] twai47: seems kinda crazy that yasuo can block smolder ult
[2:00:49] Eilaver: liandry will chain proc the ap heal cut, the ad heal cut still procs on everything but will not linger as long as liandry burn - the burn is true damage and unaffected by both. he has better ad scaling. if your the heal cut source I would say ap heal cut better IMO
[2:00:56] Electrooxd: it should work
[2:01:01] Electrooxd: on the burn
[2:01:09] ADCPurple: orb works on brand burns so i think it might work with smolder too?
[2:01:33] kmlxo: what is actual ap kaisa build?
[2:01:34] yumichai: they do stack
[2:01:35] Piksol_LoL: they do
[2:01:35] blindfunk: they do stack
[2:01:40] dreezydt: they do
[2:01:40] ADCPurple: it really doesnt matter that much but it just might be better
[2:01:40] Eclypse90: They stack multiplicatively
[2:01:45] Eclypse90: brand was stacking them for a while
[2:01:49] Harmtaro: yeah they stack
[2:01:51] Eclypse90: bugged interaction
[2:01:51] Piksol_LoL: doesnt have passive name
[2:01:54] Baltamutus: its not unique passive
[2:02:00] MikuChan1998: they do. they're called madness
[2:02:06] MikuChan1998: riftmaker+liandrys stacks
[2:02:06] chispoeta: Thinking on future, who do you think can beat TH right now?
[2:02:08] ADCPurple: xerath GC
[2:02:59] Piksol_LoL: oh wait it does have a name so shouldnt it be unique?
[2:03:12] violcncc: ofc you don't have viosin cuz it's Sona xD
[2:03:15] yumichai: it usually specifies if its unique
[2:03:32] Piksol_LoL: yeah, is there any other item like this?
[2:03:50] rases00: sona death counter, jack? gotta check
[2:03:59] Shikiorin: HES SMOLDERING
[2:04:30] Halbik: whats the strength of this build

[2:05:38] ADCPurple: @Piksol_LoL
[2:05:56] ADCPurple: @Jackspektra sona death count?
[2:06:00] Halbik: whats the strength of the liandries build
[2:06:03] nick_temporal: why did you chose that build here, just to burn the tanks from far?
[2:06:05] lucii_kyaan: 4
[2:06:09] rases00: 5-6 deaths on sona
[2:06:11] rases00: i think
[2:06:16] Eilaver: Rylai probably good if you go ER instead of iceborn
[2:06:52] Piksol_LoL: @ADCPurple he does, he had time to hit Aatrox with Maokai kinda far which wouldve give him E(I check replay to confirm)

[2:16:24] Piksol_LoL: kaisa A? Guinsoo good
[2:16:26] ADCPurple: huburis is op on her because you can just Press R and if you kill someone you go back to lane/ start fight with extra AD
[2:16:43] ascuane: why is eclipse always higher winrate on every champ lmao
[2:16:45] ADCPurple: kaisa's problem is that all OP champs counter her so so hard
[2:16:47] Piksol_LoL: fml ad break
[2:16:54] Harmtaro: eclipse kaisa is pretty nice
[2:17:29] ADCPurple: why does Eclipse give more AD than IE its crazy

[2:18:49] ADCPurple: C tier for sure
[2:18:55] ascuane: the one champ you say is bad has the best winrate out of all OMEGALUL
[2:19:03] MikuChan1998: her WR has always been pretty high
[2:19:07] Baltamutus: no one plays her
[2:19:15] ToneDoLOL: idk this site always has mega inflated win rates @Jackspektra
[2:19:20] ADCPurple: she seems god awful to play
[2:19:24] Mctankles: she's good, crit is just outclassed right now
[2:19:26] MikuChan1998: @ToneDoLOL its the best site
[2:19:27] ADCPurple: she has no real dmg and all her items are shit
[2:19:30] MikuChan1998: "inflated"
[2:19:32] ascuane: @ToneDoLOL the site is the best by far
[2:19:38] ADCPurple: and crit items are shit
[2:19:44] ascuane: you have to subtract the average winrate tho
[2:19:47] Piksol_LoL: idk every jinx I see gets turbo stomped never scales and even if she does scales never does anything

[2:19:58] Wetru: kraken got buffed in the early game
[2:20:04] rases00: she is somewhat buffed by the very cheap statikk
[2:20:08] ToneDoLOL: but like this site a champ could be bad but always has 54 win rate idk how
[2:20:18] MikuChan1998: you have to know how to search on that site properly
[2:20:21] Mctankles: @rases00 but she doesn't need or usually go statik
[2:20:32] MikuChan1998: @ToneDoLOL this isn't the site's fault bro
[2:20:35] Choc_xD: also you have to compare winrates to the average winrate for that elo at the top right
[2:20:36] MikuChan1998: Sona is dogshit
[2:20:42] MikuChan1998: yet her wr has been 53-55% wr
[2:20:45] MikuChan1998: for years
[2:20:45] ascuane: @ToneDoLOL look top right of the site and see the "average winrate in emerald"
[2:20:51] Choc_xD: to get a better understanding for the actual winrate
[2:20:54] Harmtaro: hwei support is nutty too
[2:20:57] rases00: @Mctankles new statikk isn't about the passive but stats, they are so good efficent
[2:20:59] ascuane: @ToneDoLOL and then you have to adjust with the champ winrate
[2:21:12] fran_gfa: Hola mi capitan o7
[2:21:14] ADCPurple: lucian Moakai is good too
[2:21:23] Mctankles: @rases00 yeah i know the gold efficency and all that but if you go that first then you don't have any damage without kraken
[2:21:23] ADCPurple: because stuns proc his passive too
[2:21:38] Baltamutus: A
[2:21:44] Baltamutus: kalista is in a good spot imo
[2:21:45] MikuChan1998: definitely A
[2:21:52] Manual123: kalista feels bad bcs of how cheap frozen heart is
[2:21:54] MikuChan1998: she's better in pro than soloq tho
[2:21:54] Manual123: for me
[2:21:58] ADCPurple: i think A, maybe S playing into jhin ezreal
[2:22:09] pekkaju: !bestbuildondraveninthecurrentpatch
[2:22:34] honkygg: smolder is piss tier
[2:22:47] honkygg: needs a separate tier
[2:22:48] ascuane: smolder is only Z tier champ GIGACHAD
[2:22:49] rases00: @Mctankles you really need to reach the 3 items spike, so the cheaper you can get there, the better. You need to play weakside and pick a good support that peels you
[2:23:00] Harmtaro: @honkygg worst take ever
[2:23:00] ToneDoLOL: smolder S GIGACHAD
[2:23:04] akugenda: hey Jack sorry to bother when you're doing like important things but I discovered this super funny show about like a young guy and an old dude who's super smart and he freaking turned himself into a pickle LOOOL

[2:23:54] jddjdjdj1727: @akugenda yeah i love breaking bad
[2:23:54] Mctankles: @rases00 kraken provides more damage though so you have a better chance in lane to get kills instead of just farming up and hoping the enemy adc doesn't get anything more than you
[2:24:00] ToneDoLOL: HUH
[2:24:03] ADCPurple: @Jackspektra put her in C tier so no one picks her big brain

[2:58:28] Piksol_LoL: Gain 20% (+ 0.11% per 1 Lethality) armor penetration. It's giving like 21% armor pen x d
[2:58:28] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr
[2:58:39] Piksol_LoL: it has 45 ad(hubris 60+) and less lethality
[2:58:44] xcalebur: if u go in practice tool and u build opp serylda vs opp hubris
[2:58:46] MikuChan1998: its good with 3 other lethality items
[2:58:47] xcalebur: the serylda will do more dmg
[2:58:56] xcalebur: no its better with 1 xd

[3:00:11] omme_12: Arctic ops is the lethality skin, no?
[3:00:12] xcalebur: i dont think u math well
[3:00:34] xcalebur: if he cut 20% of 60 armor thats 12 + it has the flat lethality on it ontop
[3:00:35] Piksol_LoL: artic ops is the dps skin
[3:00:41] Piksol_LoL: cosmic is the lethality
[3:00:51] xcalebur: thats way more lethality than hubris gives ?
[3:00:58] xcalebur: or youmuu
[3:01:11] xcalebur: % is applied before flat thats why its good

[3:03:53] Piksol_LoL: @xcalebur so it's like 28 armor pen vs 18, but 15 less AD(minimum) idk
[3:03:54] Dragdar: Lethality Varus is so fucking broken and useless at the same time it's funny
[3:04:04] Piksol_LoL: I'd say just go practice tool and check
[3:04:24] el_danixd: its disgusting in lane and then u go in an actual fight into dive champs and realise ur worthless

[3:05:38] Wetru: cuz 4 kills are not enough, she needs more gold
[3:05:44] xcalebur: why hp?
[3:05:48] xcalebur: i didnt do hp
[3:06:07] xcalebur: but the slow removal only really effects champs like ez not varus imo

[3:12:30] AGENTAU123: nothing karma says will be intelligent LUL
[3:12:37] 1Nickles: she's been yapping whole game

[3:15:23] Piksol_LoL: HAHAHAA
[3:15:28] capitan_alexis: told you
[3:15:33] capitan_alexis: karma players are mentally ill
[3:15:35] MikuChan1998: we know top is warded now
[3:15:38] MikuChan1998: KEKW
[3:15:51] Piksol_LoL: RIOT? HTBOX?
[3:16:09] Nikushaa: does zilean revive with low hp if you throw E on his corpse?
[3:16:22] mraldax: This Karma
[3:16:24] Dragdar: I like to think that whatever life they live that causes them to be sad enough to behave that way is their punishment in itself
[3:16:26] Baltamutus: imagine if karma had a single working brain cell
[3:16:39] Nikushaa: @Dragdar copium
[3:16:48] mraldax: Can we perma this guy on Karma?
[3:16:50] rases00: and the best thing is that nothing will happen to her even if you report her. And people wonder why high elo is toxic, lol
[3:16:51] el_danixd: like i may flame ppl and be toxic sometimes but at least i play the game and dont troll on purpose
[3:17:02] Nubnubs: in these type of game i always go "fuck if only i played better " LUL
[3:17:04] Chipez: Its all Riots fault.
[3:17:11] theblasphemer666: but riot could still like.... punish them

[3:17:27] Piksol_LoL: This is way the wintraders in Poland's league didnt get ban kekw
[3:17:30] xcalebur: she is probably delusional enough to not feel shame
[3:17:33] rases00: she is a janna main, she doesn't know what shame is
[3:17:40] 1Nickles: I mean you have to have such a shitty life to behave like this on a video game
[3:17:49] el_danixd: cuz RIOT cant just hire 5 interns to spectate high elo games, thats too much investment
[3:18:18] lolmirai: thing that sucks abt varus is that u just cant 1v9 on him

[3:23:56] akugenda: wait, I don't get the lore, did Yack turn into the chair or that dude on the right?
[3:24:32] rases00: the moment your entire community knows that you can be toxic and get away unscathed, it is too late

[5:32:38] RukiHyena: Bt probably better with bonus hp
[5:32:42] Ahnddie: @el_danixd lane isn't that bad, W does a lot of dmg early
