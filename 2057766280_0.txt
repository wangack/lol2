[1:18:06] skander_bhj: the percentage of magic pen depends on how much magic pen u have , and u have 0 magic pen , the 40 or 13 percent of it is still 0
[1:18:07] jt_black_93: Ya, I just Googled to verify we're not crazy.
[1:18:24] Smoothcollie: @jaketin8 Hasn't been tank meta here for like 5 years now? kaypLUL I mean last season or the season before there was a kha/kin/cat meta, but before that? Tanks Sadge
[1:18:28] jtschecki: What made you decide to try and get a visa in Denmark?
[1:18:40] jimbob_ywert: niceeee
[1:18:42] jt_black_93: So EUW, are you not in Canada anymore?
[1:18:48] Jaketin8: @TyrTheTiny As tank main, even i find that disgusting, i shouldnt do that much dmg with full tank builds, oh your fed mage? I have 2 mr items and i dont care about your dmg but you die to mine in 10secs if i miss everything, 5 if i land
[1:18:58] shedfirekid1: is liandrys good on cass?
[1:19:05] Crossarch: @skander_bhj You're incorrect
[1:19:14] bedo_777: HII kp how are u doing
[1:19:15] skander_bhj: Yh
[1:19:17] Crossarch: These 40% makes you ignore 40% of target's MR
[1:19:29] skander_bhj: yeah exaclty , badly explained my self haha
[1:19:34] Crossarch: Oh
[1:19:38] jt_black_93: Based on enemy MR, not your AP.
[1:19:49] Crossarch: Nah, I understand what he meant
[1:19:52] shedfirekid1: oh what a turn of events
[1:19:57] jimbob_ywert: Samira is disgusting
[1:19:58] S17Master: Went in without Sera R
[1:20:01] Crossarch: He meant if you deal 0 damage, even 40% mpen won't help much
[1:20:06] Smoothcollie: Samira does Samira things kaypAwkward
[1:20:10] omelette_xx: Oh i take back what i said about the team lol
[1:20:12] mrshibasan: Happy lunar new year here in the philippines
[1:20:16] Jaketin8: @Smoothcollie Pretty much yeah, last year or so, its been getting worse and worse, bruisers and tanks are way overpowered making dmg dealers seem useless againts them, resulting in the the dmg overall being increased and now dmg dealers one shot each other, while tanks/bruisers have 1min lasting 1v1s
[1:20:34] shedfirekid1: cosmic or liandrys not bad
[1:20:43] Razmeck: Zhonyas should be the next item
[1:21:01] jzipfel20: cosmic would be fun!
[1:21:12] jimbob_ywert: Cosmic drive seems best
[1:21:13] jt_black_93: liandry's imo. you're kind of your team's damage rn. if you fall off you risk never killing poppy.
[1:21:33] jzipfel20: or finish archangel
[1:21:35] jt_black_93: like that MF ult barely tickled her and she ate 90% of it
[1:21:42] skander_bhj: Anti heal kinda helps against there comp now
[1:21:47] S17Master: Poppy took the whole MF R for literally 0 damage holy shit
[1:22:04] Smoothcollie: @jaketin8 Well we know what is Rito favourite style of battling/favourite role kaypUpsetti
[1:22:37] jt_black_93: anti heal not the move here
[1:22:41] jimbob_ywert: cosmic drive into liandries
[1:22:53] Smoothcollie: Ye antiheal is waste of slot for mages
[1:22:54] shedfirekid1: yeah not anti heal. need more damage/shred
[1:23:07] NoPainNoDane: sell everything and get all zeals? yone did really well when he did that
[1:23:19] skander_bhj: 90 AP with Grievous woundswith the magic pen can do it i think , i mean dmg enough
[1:23:26] shedfirekid1: cosmic/liandrys best options imo
[1:23:30] tturkeybaconclub: zhonyas is 120 ap now no? not bad
[1:23:31] Niomah: Aren't Zhonyas and Banshees 120 AP?
[1:23:46] skander_bhj: dont forget kinds of poppy wont heal that much or regen fast so less TTK
[1:24:01] watson1235: watson1235 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 95 months, currently on a 95 month streak! happy friyay!
[1:24:06] jimbob_ywert: Cass’s most OP build rn is Roa > Archangel > Rylais >cosmic > liandries. Void staff is situational but usually isn’t built on her
[1:24:11] reginaphalange00: @skander_bhj whats ttk
[1:24:23] skander_bhj: time to kill
[1:24:31] mrry2k: the split pushing playstyle has to be the most unfun shit in the game
[1:24:33] Smoothcollie: @skander_bhj But Sera can buy antiheal. If u can get more ap, get more ap and better stats than morello Sadge
[1:24:45] Niomah: Malignance doesn't suck on her either. Since they're stuck in place by her ult the Magic Resist reduction gets cray
[1:24:54] jocoke: @KayPea why not liandry's?
[1:25:06] PrincessPix: I love the new hair the curls really suit you
[1:25:06] S17Master: @Smoothcollie Ehh, they gutted Putrifier, it's a worthless buy now
[1:25:09] watson1235: kaypLove
[1:25:18] jt_black_93: just ulted
[1:25:19] jt_black_93: no flash
[1:25:32] omelette_xx: kaypInLove
[1:25:35] skander_bhj: True , but dont forget Seraph is an easy target to focus , she dies that a big prob , at least they need a second anti heal since ksante dont have thorn

[1:26:15] Smoothcollie: @s17master Well morello is thrashy as well, do u want to have weaker mid or supp? At the end of the day, Sera can buy morello as well, if u say morrelo Is better
[1:26:28] DomiStae: !eu
[1:26:28] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[1:26:31] jimbob_ywert: Gotta give props to that fizz’s back step to dodge your ult
[1:26:33] skander_bhj: Seraph embrace and anti heal that a huge dmg + defensive passive
[1:26:40] omelette_xx: i cant click on my name can i?
[1:26:54] mrshibasan: I think shadow flame will help you do like a low hp enemies
[1:26:57] DomiStae: woooow welcome in eu :) Belgium here
[1:26:59] dylanship: Happy Friday. I had the games like this when my team was in the lead but their enemy team kept pushing and we lost lol.
[1:27:06] jt_black_93: i am hoping the shyv rework removes this AP aoe one shot mechanic
[1:27:06] SquirrelMaster61985: 3/3 jungler with 325 cs
[1:27:08] Rincewurst: I man after 30 minutes, k/d ratio isnt really the bar anymore, is it
[1:27:15] aliorvt: @mrshibasan yeah and lyandrys intead of zonyas :/
[1:27:32] Frozenfruit13: @omelette_xx on mobile you can’t, august 13 2023 is your follow day
[1:27:34] omelette_xx: how is that possible Omg
[1:27:36] Afcb89: Afternoon all
[1:27:36] thevandenberger: 3 and 3 jg. you kinda left out the 300+ cs. tad important
[1:27:44] inSINwetrust: rooVroom rooVroom
[1:27:59] omelette_xx: @frozenfruit13 Oh okayyy, thanks
[1:27:59] jimbob_ywert: tbf Lillias movement speed works well with her kit and has disadvantages
[1:28:34] DJ_Photik: Is Cass inherently faster
[1:28:47] Crossarch: Nah, you do great
[1:28:50] Crossarch: It's just those games sometiems
[1:28:56] jimbob_ywert: Worst thing in league is when you have to deal with armored minions WITH a baron 😭 impossinle
[1:29:03] Smoothcollie: @skander_bhj And again, ksante can get antiheal as well. I think adc antiheal isn't great as well, cuz no one builds it. Antiheal in general is thrashy kaypLUL sorry I'm highly against mage mid getting an antiheal
[1:29:24] Crossarch: GOD this magic shield on Poppy is disgusting
[1:29:33] Lipp5_: Hi Kp, you look cute today!! :D
[1:29:43] Crossarch: Wot
[1:29:43] thevandenberger: no. but you’re not max build yet
[1:29:48] Crossarch: She just chopped 75% of turret
[1:29:52] reginaphalange00: turrets are minions atp
[1:30:04] skander_bhj: See samiras healing without anti heal ?
[1:30:06] P3rr0s: nt
[1:30:15] GunzaPrime: nt nt nt
[1:30:19] skander_bhj: nty
[1:30:21] skander_bhj: nt
[1:30:31] skander_bhj: orb there kill her
[1:30:37] nikkotari: hello guyss
[1:30:40] shedfirekid1: she did have orb
[1:30:54] thevandenberger: kekw so true
[1:30:54] sovitiaisavampire: he literally plays a different game
[1:31:05] jimbob_ywert: Like sorry I don’t know how to counter every single champion in the game 😭 some champions are busted because they take advantage of peoples lack of knowledge on how to counter them
[1:31:09] S17Master: It's fascinating how League is a vastly different game based on what echelon of the skill tiers you're in
[1:31:10] Crossarch: @sovitiaisavampire Basically yeah
[1:31:12] Afcb89: THey are gods among insects
[1:31:36] Niomah: High ELO players tend to know how to play with teamwork, and it requires that vs a Shyvana
[1:31:51] ajak636: and dont get me started with master yi
[1:31:52] aliorvt: exactly, l¿just like a split pusher tryndamere, I hate that champ so much joshsekiRage
[1:32:01] n8duhgr8one: n8duhgr8one subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! I keep trying to get out of this basement but the people and streamer are too good here for me to leave
[1:32:15] jimbob_ywert: Aurelion sol has 54% WR in low elo but 48% WR in high elo… lol
[1:32:28] Crossarch: It's easily traceable on ugg when you put filter to Emerald+ and then compare it against GM+Challenger, the tier lists will be totally different
[1:32:33] Rincewurst: watched qtp yesterday and I gotta say.. ingame chat is way more constructive in higher elo/mmr. so its not just the game bein unbalanced, its the player base being so heavily divided
[1:32:34] HAYB3AR: HAYB3AR subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:32:38] punika87: in low they cant finish on time i believe;c
[1:32:47] DragoonRed: Broxah has a short about him literally oneshotting a support as shyv and was like wtf is this dmg lol
[1:32:50] visceramami: hey that's not true! I'm bad at everything in this game
[1:32:54] backstreetalright: hey kaypHappea
[1:33:09] QTwinkyyy: I still remember your video of "Sej ult does that?" kaypLOL
[1:33:15] lolitos96: hi you re beatifll
[1:33:18] blitznotkriegg: may I say KayPea is kind of Peacute =)
[1:33:23] lilCACTUSS9: and it still feels like the game is balanced for the minority NotLikeThis
[1:33:27] cuteamoeba: Hiii bestieeee
[1:33:36] shamneo: shamneo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 1/4 of the way there. i hear i get to see sunlight at 100.. stay awesome KP

[1:33:40] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[1:33:52] nikkotari: tbh I think shyvana is fine even in highelo, cause her kit is really mixed...so I think people can manage winning with her aswell
[1:34:13] nikkotari: like I rember like few months ago she got nerfed, cause she was amazing even in high elo
[1:34:15] blitznotkriegg: "usain bolt" xD true
[1:34:27] Rincewurst: Shyv is good by design. but her numbers... whoof
[1:34:44] arcadedani: and you can be ok whit the fact that is stupid for an AD TANK to do tons of dmg going AP...
[1:34:46] liobanil: I just got called a 🐔
[1:35:13] Rincewurst: if only she was the only champ with that issue sp4zieDerp
[1:35:29] Crossarch: I don't even know wtf Ksante does, coz his tooltips are confusing
[1:35:32] shedfirekid1: anyone remember when shyvana used to be bruiser top lane?
[1:35:39] Rincewurst: lets see if I get ads this time
[1:35:41] maurrigane: the gameplay is very hard tho, u need to spam everything every time very fast
[1:35:44] Nikodermos: @Crossarch everything
[1:35:44] meep_: hey Kaypea and chat! I hope that everyone's week is going well! kaypLove PrideFlower PrideToucan
[1:36:00] lilCACTUSS9: and has pretty good mobility for a full tank
[1:36:05] Casyo99: I miss the old kha mid and rengar top :/
[1:36:07] OptimusBrian1357: Yo Kute nose Kelsie 😁✌🏾
[1:36:15] bloodinesser: no idea what k'sante does either. we shut him down early a few games ago and ignored him. by end game he was 1v5ing us
[1:36:28] Rincewurst: nope. no ad so far graenzEyes
[1:36:39] bloodinesser: im iron so super low elo
[1:36:40] izzy645: sweet now I get to see what goes on during the commercial break 🙂
[1:36:48] ani671: Theres also the one adc champ that no one plays cuz his learning curve is steep af, but the few that do play him are god lvl.
[1:36:50] rescued: was playing league last night and the ksante was 1v9ing
[1:36:55] Oivichyhuiseaux: Elo is a name, not an initialism
[1:37:04] Rincewurst: germany. but Ive gotten ads here before. twitch is wild for me.
[1:37:11] lilCACTUSS9: of bullshit @KayPea you can say it out loud. It's just us
[1:37:19] MrsBeebles: hi hi <3
[1:37:21] cuteamoeba: Bestie u look gorgeous,divaaaa
[1:37:24] Rincewurst: Im almost certain Ive gotten ads as a sub, too xD
[1:37:52] DomiStae: why Denmark if I may ask?
[1:37:57] OptimusBrian1357: I got an AD before you said you'd run one
[1:37:59] QTwinkyyy: The people who 1 trick Nilah have overall a 56.94% wr sooo... yeah
[1:37:59] jimbob_ywert: literally look at the difference> busted Low elo champs include: Maokai, Ksante, Asol, Illaoi, Briar, and Master Yi. for PRO play it’s: Renekton, Hwei, Zed, Ekko, GP, Fiddlesticks, and Ksante 😭 I got these stats from lol.gg
[1:38:03] Niomah: @DomiStae Because her husband is Danish
[1:38:12] Casyo99: The game is to far unbalanced
[1:38:16] DomiStae: @niomah oooow
[1:38:19] Casyo99: never saw it this bad
[1:38:38] Rincewurst: yesterday I got an ad when I joined but none when you said youd play one graenzShrug
[1:38:56] ani671: Im just a lil ole lux trying to hit snares and ults on high moby champs okay!!! kaypRiot kaypRiot kaypRiot
[1:39:01] bloodinesser: @jimbob_ywert i agree with this, no idea how to deal with anyone on that list lol
[1:39:04] DomiStae: Belgium here, come visit Ghent :)
[1:39:05] jimbob_ywert: Orianna game?
[1:39:13] Casyo99: I never get ads tho even when I'm not a sub
[1:39:17] inSINwetrust: So you're saying it is time to be Faker and play K'Sante mid? umbraHmm
[1:39:36] jimbob_ywert: You played lux last game yesterday
[1:39:39] Rincewurst: certainly. its different for me everytime xD but twitch chat also reconnects for me on a not only regular but rather frequent basis
[1:39:39] jimbob_ywert: and won insanely
[1:39:49] dylanship: @jimbob_ywert Ksante seems bursted overall lol
[1:39:52] shedfirekid1: you had 1 game as lux
[1:40:04] cuteamoeba: we stan a mother lux main🩷😘😭
[1:40:06] mentalfordaayz: Hi-a Kels
[1:40:08] Niomah: time to pull out Veigar and make Gwen cranky?
[1:40:15] jimbob_ywert: @dylanship definitely lol he’s a tank and bruiser which is disgusting
[1:40:16] mentalfordaayz: kaypComfy
[1:40:17] cuteamoeba: YAAAS QUEEN
[1:40:20] DragoonRed: Play more ziggs, so you can teach me how to teach my wife to ziggs better XD
[1:40:22] jimbob_ywert: ZIGGSSS
[1:40:28] morganlxve: @dylanship if you don't punish him hard pre six he's a nightmare :(
[1:40:31] AmandaApple: Heyhey daveyxHAPPY
[1:40:33] shamneo: what a beefy frontline
[1:40:34] Rincewurst: let your hair fall the way it wants graenzMad free the hair!
[1:40:38] shedfirekid1: gamba?
[1:40:39] QTwinkyyy: if you go Lux can we get MCdonalds since we didn't get it yesterday? kaypInLove
[1:40:45] inSINwetrust: Not that skin rooMadSlam
[1:40:49] nicolasxduarte: Do you have all lux skins?
[1:40:56] ani671: You have enough hard cc and tank teammates to go lux.
[1:40:57] AmandaApple: The hair is in front of the map
[1:41:07] cuteamoeba: i got beef with my hair too LMAO
[1:41:12] jimbob_ywert: Go prestigeeee!
[1:41:18] Rincewurst: does anyone else not see the difference or is it just me graenzEyes
[1:41:38] cuteamoeba: i used to remember my fav skin for lux wss the witch one
[1:41:38] jimbob_ywert: ooo been a while since elementalist
[1:41:51] lilCACTUSS9: I lost 4 out of the 5 placements... or should I say..I WON a game (out of 5)
[1:41:52] jimbob_ywert: Lol I’m pretty sure that Zac was talking to u
[1:42:04] AmandaApple: I mean, the hair is in front of your eyes (you cant see the map) :D
[1:42:09] ani671: kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame
[1:42:18] vanna_rl: Do u have a favorite skin?
[1:42:23] AmandaApple: Jax ?
[1:42:23] morganlxve: that's master yi in my eyes tbh
[1:42:24] ajak636: and jax too
[1:42:24] Afcb89: Predictiopn time!
[1:42:24] J0LLYR0GER: As a guy thats why I keep my hair VERY short. DOnt want to mess with my hair every morning when I already have to get two kids breakfast and ready for the day as well as myself ll
[1:42:26] nicolasxduarte: I know right
[1:42:30] shamneo: so zed can see in the dark
[1:42:37] Rincewurst: @cuteamoeba stop smearing dead cow onto your scalp Kappa
[1:42:42] AmandaApple: Sure!
[1:42:45] Shoebandit: Well hello there! Soooo, what's new around here!? Haven't been around for 2 years :(
[1:42:46] kareena: hiiiii KPOPheart
[1:42:50] QTwinkyyy: BTW Mid and ADC are duo! @KayPea
[1:42:51] d0gma06: 53
[1:43:05] AmandaApple: What is a DH stack?
[1:43:06] jimbob_ywert: Many of the recent skins (especially female skins) literally look like any champ you want them to be. All female skin splasharts have chizzled jawlines, pouty lips, and an overwhelming design you can’t tell what champ is what.
[1:43:23] DragoonRed: @AmandaApple dark harvest has get it when hit a champ below 50 (or 40%? hp) something like that
[1:43:32] AmandaApple: @DragoonRed Thank you
[1:43:39] reginaphalange00: @jimbob_ywert and they look like out of mobile games
[1:43:43] J0LLYR0GER: @QTwinkyyy How can u tell they are duo?
[1:43:47] Terrorclaus: i can predict exactly 0 points, because of Dutch restrictions xd
[1:44:00] AmandaApple: Oof, I can't vote. I'm from the Netherlands. Sad ;D
[1:44:06] AmandaApple: I knew that, but i forgot.
[1:44:08] S17Master: It's definitely not 50% KEKW
[1:44:08] Rincewurst: they do, tho graenzEyes
[1:44:17] nicolasxduarte: The 50% is bs
[1:44:23] J0LLYR0GER: There is not shot its 50% I was guessing 30%
[1:44:23] Niomah: I entirely thought it was 35%
[1:44:29] QTwinkyyy: @J0LLYR0GER I always check with both porofessor and OP.GG
[1:44:36] AGENTAU123: moin moin
[1:44:42] Rincewurst: he was AT 50% weSmart
[1:45:11] S17Master: Noice
[1:45:13] AmandaApple: Well played Kay
[1:45:17] J0LLYR0GER: 332 should be half he had about 300 and u werent getting the DH
[1:45:21] tequilamanhere: hello community HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[1:45:25] Nikodermos: 50% til lvl 6 and then decreasing down to 25 % 6-18 is far more likely given all the game exp with the rune set
[1:45:27] jt_black_93: EZ
[1:45:29] AmandaApple: Yaaaaassh! Nice
[1:45:30] immortalrockgod: first blood gang gang
[1:45:30] Jefrienaiter: GJ!
[1:45:34] lilCACTUSS9: wpwpwpwp
[1:45:35] S17Master: FB and Zed's Flash
[1:45:36] shedfirekid1: sheeeeeeesh
[1:45:37] jimbob_ywert: @reginaphalange00 Definitely! Their faces are too glossy they look like mobile legends splasharts lol. Some male champs suffer the same but I think overall they have a more identifiable face because Riot doesn’t care about their looks as much as women
[1:45:41] AmandaApple: :o
[1:45:55] Rincewurst: he did ignite you, didnt he?
[1:45:56] Crossarch: Well, now he doesn't have ignite
[1:46:00] Crossarch: Def heard the ignire sound
[1:46:04] Dezrunner: Haaaaaaai Ms. Pea! Hows today been treating you?
[1:46:06] Crossarch: ignite*
[1:46:09] Jefrienaiter: 3 stacks btw
[1:46:11] reginaphalange00: @jimbob_ywert agreed bro
[1:46:13] jt_black_93: yeah no f until 7 min~ on Zed
[1:46:14] jimbob_ywert: He flashed before when u chased him
[1:46:16] k0t10n: kaypArrive hello @KayPea it is I your daily reminder to remind you to put map cover on!
[1:46:29] Rincewurst: yeah, he flashed away from you on river. but you didnt ping the ignite I think
[1:47:30] Rincewurst: now you can get his double buff! Jebaited
[1:47:35] Dezrunner: Its weekend no? Can't be all bad then. Trying to wind Lucas up a little, but it aint working :P so VERY productive
[1:47:36] jimbob_ywert: someone tally the amount of canons KP misses so we can spam kaypShame if it’s above 15
[1:48:03] IceMockah: !canon
[1:48:26] k0t10n: kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame
[1:48:47] Rincewurst: the cure sp4zieLovea

[2:09:55] jt_black_93: it's to avoid skill shots while ulting b/c it's a wind up. it also really messes with people's heads in a chaotic team fight

[2:52:51] Oakley85: It amazes me how people get names as ridiculous as that
[2:52:57] FeedTheTank: @jimbob_ywert which is why Riot hasn't buffed or nerfed him, as he is pretty balanced already

[3:20:56] shedfirekid1: gamba!
[3:21:03] Oakley85: His E gives him attack speed and every third auto does on hit magic damage that scales off AD and AP
[3:21:19] GhostyTBear99: Hes been a bit busted ever since his ratio changes
[3:21:29] ericaborgest: okay I'm officially here for last game Sadge
