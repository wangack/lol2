Lillia arc didnt work. Bel'veth arc didnt work. Nothing works, and on top of it, hecarim nerfs incoming. Every day you approach the edge of the cliff, stare down, and turn around only to find yourself at the edge once more. Without hecarim, life is void, and the bottom of the cliff calls your name.
