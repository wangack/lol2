[4:09:26] elduin: I think they should rework teemo to similar as hewi. With multiple stacking spell effects
[4:11:09] darth_r2doppeld2: I'm so thankful for you bro, for real. Your streams are one of the few constants in my life.

[4:30:37] Rasree: Dcap goes on Q n E tho
[4:30:38] Aldurfus: @LolTheGiver shrooms are not guaranteed damage

[4:33:42] 514484: he might go maligma into unplayable matchups
[4:33:42] pikapika_666_: do the support have anti-heal for the draven?
[4:33:45] LolTheGiver: why zil doesn't have anti heal tho
[4:33:55] LolTheGiver: @pikapika_666_ nope

[4:46:17] halbyoshi: Nothing sexier than 5 man ligma with one shroom
[4:47:17] halbyoshi: Ldr can also be good
[4:47:26] jordyutopia: its all about controlling top side in high tier, they dont get to fight grubs or any other objective because you dominating the lane imo
[4:48:12] EG_Kel: NoNo
[4:48:38] halbyoshi: Its easy to get at least 1
[4:49:11] halbyoshi: Also if enemy only has 4 they get no grubbies spawned
[4:49:21] jordyutopia: yes rift for the win
[4:49:28] 514484: i agree, the grub buff itself is minimal
[4:50:51] halbyoshi: Grubs can also tank one turretshot
[4:51:16] jordyutopia: exactly and also you take advantage on enemies whose goal is to hold lane like some tanks, they get baited into these early fights
[4:51:41] Lazynameross: they minimize needing to wait for waves
[4:52:09] EG_Kel: egg zatly NOTED
[4:53:19] Lazynameross: didnt they just do this to fizz?
[4:53:22] Wuju_Highland3r: NOTED True

[4:55:15] jordyutopia: but not the dot
[4:55:32] Lazynameross: NEW EFFECT: Damage is now applied to structures at 50% damage. Includes empowered attack, damage over time, and on-hit effects. Damage over time is not applied to inhibitors.
[4:55:43] Lazynameross: 14.2
[4:56:21] jordyutopia: oh really? is that true?
[4:56:25] jordyutopia: let me test thjat
[4:56:26] pikapika_666_: " In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields"
[4:56:58] Lazynameross: i dont play fizz, i just vaguely remembered quantum talking about it LUL
[4:57:18] Lazynameross: but yeah, if they can do for fizz, they can do for teemo
