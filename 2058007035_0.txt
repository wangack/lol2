[1:02:02] Noobmasta5000: argument sucks, assassin loses to tank regardless of champ (in concept)
[1:02:10] OasisOfStorms: Adc players can be silly too. Build full damage against 3 dive assassins and get one shot then say their role sucks.

[1:05:01] Yep_Banana: adc are selfish and then they int and afk
[1:05:02] dalfaro90: That's what most laners do
[1:05:04] the_real_keila: If adc is outlaned he is not going to be strong
[1:05:04] OasisOfStorms: pick safer when you are 1st or second pick
[1:05:04] HaidarBror: YEP Cocka
[1:05:05] Nightbot: YEP
[1:05:09] rases00: that's what separates good adcs from posers imo
[1:05:15] FireXIII: Yo Baron got hands
[1:05:15] Umang94: picking against lane as adc is fine tbh, there are also more good blind picks on adc than on other roles
[1:05:18] EnvyS7N: thats mostly because bot lane has a lot of pressure in early game so the match up matters the most compared to other lanes?
[1:05:24] bingbongscoob: I need help in food champs for jungle in good 1 I play nocturne lee sin and zac
[1:05:29] bingbongscoob: gold
[1:05:34] Keyupiopi: win lane win game. Kappa
[1:05:34] OzymandiasTheGreatII: usually if I look at the enemy team and see that I can't 1v5 I just pick someone to make sure I don't hyper lose lane
[1:05:35] lofiReindeer: "adcs think..." whoa hold on let's not assume too much
