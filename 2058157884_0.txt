[0:53:10] Fr0stWulf: like you hit them for like 4 ticks and it explodes
[0:53:13] sack02: but his champ stack farming got buffed
[0:53:14] TheMadBadger: @Fr0stWulf and when it bursts, he gets stardust stacks which are his infinite scaling stuff
[0:53:15] M3raN0M1: They gave him +6% dmg on his q during W at rank 5, and gave him 3 stacks instead of 1 per second of q, which meant he hit like 300 stacks in 25 minutes and took over games
[0:53:28] Oglino: its a huge buff imo
[0:53:38] M3raN0M1: @Lawlman W bonus dmg on q was hotfixed to 12% at rank 5 and his q stacks were knocked down to 2 per second instead of 3
[0:53:43] TheMadBadger: He got a big buff but they had to hotfix nerf it
[0:53:48] Oglino: not even imo its just a flat buff
[0:54:01] M3raN0M1: yes

[2:27:36] CompulsiveOne: OMEGALUL
[2:27:37] Salty_Platypus: so a bunch of LARPers teaming up to kill wildlife
[2:27:37] Colgaldy: If the dragon is a threat, and doesn't have the ability to transform into a hot woman that asks me to join her.
[2:27:42] Fr0stWulf: oh fuck no id fuck up and eagle
[2:27:46] Oglino: OMEGALUL
[2:27:49] Fr0stWulf: komodo dragons are freaks

[2:28:01] TheGrayPlains: Shruge sure. I can't wait for lawlmans dragon to breath infinite range fire and have most of chat die.
[2:28:37] basstieon: i mean your human and if it touches skin with its saliva you will not survive the infection
[2:28:58] Oglino: I mean if I have a weapon I could take the komodo
[2:28:59] mattband: what spec is the dragon. so I can counter it.
[2:28:59] Fr0stWulf: twitch RAGEY give me my prime sub back
[2:28:59] Doctor_Richie: HUh
[2:29:00] TyrannessBelial: No it's on touch bacteria
[2:29:02] Doctor_Richie: what are we talking about
[2:29:04] TyrannessBelial: Oh no yes it will actually
[2:29:09] TyrannessBelial: Komodo Dragon is that viral
[2:29:11] Oglino: komodo dragon saliva
[2:29:13] omgwhatlolz: Those bites insta infect
[2:29:16] ramspaz: I have heard of a man that lost his leg to a komodo dragon
[2:29:28] Morphogum: yeah it's bacterial infection so unless you have at least a scratch you get nothing
[2:29:43] twyxtr: have you tried it?
[2:29:48] Doctor_Richie: The komodo dragon bacterial saliva is a myth
[2:29:50] Doctor_Richie: its a poison
[2:30:01] wingedillidan: Poison sampling time? poggSpin
[2:30:18] omgwhatlolz: Time to smooch a dragon... for science
[2:30:27] Doctor_Richie: Yuh there has to be an open source and then you need an incubation period
[2:30:30] TyrannessBelial: It both has a venom and a bacterial infection
[2:30:32] Doctor_Richie: streamer is smart
[2:30:37] Melamamoduro: Pores?
[2:30:43] TyrannessBelial: And the venom's job is to cause wounding.
[2:30:44] bandit0424: lots of stuff is skin permeable tbf
[2:30:46] omgwhatlolz: Streamer is secretly a dragon
[2:30:49] Fr0stWulf: i trust the doctors opinion NODDERS
[2:30:56] Kevendithas: @TyrannessBelial HUH
[2:31:01] mattband: has there been a human in history that has won a fist fight with a Komodo dragon
[2:31:06] sack02: yeah no they just have venom which prevent clotting
[2:31:11] wingedillidan: Is this from the same debate as fighting with an eagle? crendorHmm chat doesn't like animals
[2:31:11] sack02: so you bleed out slowly
[2:31:13] fluffypandaa214: your skin is the first and best line of defense chat
[2:31:14] Doctor_Richie: Your skin is a barrier to bacteria and dehydration that is its base function
[2:31:17] Doctor_Richie: the second function is to get you laids
[2:31:29] kingsableye: People have hunted Komodo Dragons a lot
[2:31:34] kingsableye: Pointy sticks are VERY OP
[2:31:43] CompulsiveOne: spear gaming ezz
[2:31:47] TyrannessBelial: Komodo Dragons are very fast, they're like crocodiles andother ambush predators
[2:31:48] kingsableye: It's crazy how much a long pointy stick really ups things in your favour
[2:31:48] Salty_Platypus: humans have probably attempted to hunt every single species at one point or another
[2:31:48] sack02: the bacteria thing is a myth, not more than any other carnivore
[2:31:49] uppenchamp: If we get tools we win most match ups
[2:31:55] Oglino: you give me pointy stick I win againts anything in nature

[2:32:08] omgwhatlolz: Would you eat a dragon if prepared safely?
[2:32:21] TyrannessBelial: Yeah
[2:32:24] NoSweetOnlySalty: stick op, break stick have two stick, stick always win NODDERS
[2:32:28] SnailintheShell: It probably doesn't taste good.
[2:32:30] TyrannessBelial: I'll eat any reptile, bird, or mammal once.
[2:32:49] Oglino: BASED
[2:32:56] uppenchamp: I'd eat dragon 100%
[2:32:56] wingedillidan: But not Lunchables Sludge
[2:32:56] 31415man: Even like a century egg?
[2:33:02] CompulsiveOne: i could not eat a bug
[2:33:11] CompulsiveOne: my fear would ruin me
[2:33:18] kingsableye: Grow human meat in a lab, no ethical concerns, Lawlman gets to try it SeemsGood
[2:33:37] Oglino: I could eat bugs probably
[2:33:38] basstieon: my issue with bugs more so spiders would be im afraid it would trigger my shellfish allegery
[2:33:45] Oglino: assuming they were dried/cooked
[2:33:45] ramspaz: I bet a guy killed a komodo dragon and wore it's skin like a leather jacket
[2:33:59] uppenchamp: Technically human meat is the most anabolic
[2:34:08] kingsableye: There is commercially available lab-grown chicken meat now
[2:34:13] Fr0stWulf: dont humans taste really bad
[2:34:15] TheGrayPlains: it's just not teched yet
[2:34:20] sack02: no
[2:34:27] sack02: even if it reaches that point
[2:34:27] MuzzyBeast98: Its done just expensive for right now
[2:34:30] TyrannessBelial: Problem is the farming indsutry would lobby against it
[2:34:31] TyrannessBelial: cus money
[2:34:37] Morphogum: it also cost a lot compared to just raising a cow
[2:34:38] sack02: there's too much invested in cows
[2:34:38] uppenchamp: I think it's very resource intensive
[2:34:40] Othiren: I believe it is a tech gap and lobby gap so far
[2:34:42] Fynagle: The "bottleneck" to lab-meat is the process is very resource-intensive and can't be scaled.
[2:34:43] bandit0424: I mean in terms of climate change and water shortages and sea levels rising at some point meat is gonna be a rich person thing *eventually*
[2:34:43] omgwhatlolz: It needs more time to be mass produced. I had vegi nuggs without knowing and had no idea they werent chicken
[2:34:47] kingsableye: Lab grown meat had some technological hurdles, but those have been passed now. The only thing that needs to happen is commercialization/industrialization
[2:34:57] fluffypandaa214: hate jungle brand this season very annoying
[2:35:03] kingsableye: We just need to figure out how to grow it in economically viable batches, now
[2:35:18] bandit0424: except for insects, those probably will continue to be around commercially for a long time cattle not so much
[2:35:21] Othiren: But also how much of the cattle industry is just subsidized too?
[2:35:39] eternal_observer: Economically viable is not economically effective.
[2:35:46] omgwhatlolz: Fake chicken is there. Blew my mind
[2:35:53] sack02: regardless of whether or not lab meat becomes cheaper than normal meat cow meat will still be the primary source
[2:35:56] basstieon: well the impossible meat is an issue because its not specifically "good" for digestion in many cases mostly because of the chemicals they use for it according to research studies
[2:36:02] kingsableye: There's been a lot of work recently to improve that, people have started "3D Printing" it to give it the same texture as traditional meat
[2:36:06] fluffypandaa214: until they run out of cows
[2:36:10] MyGamingInGeneral: we gonna be missing our normal lives soon amsbtHehe
[2:36:21] Funnymunny: Impossible burgers aren't meat they a re plants
[2:36:25] Morphogum: lab grown meat is real meat, it's not fake tofu meat
[2:36:42] Moobot: Welcome to the sub club, Kirius!
[2:36:44] Thaurrus: i just wish i could have super cheap peppers and broccoloi

[2:56:09] Hellifyoudont66: 100k isn't enough for anything, man.
[2:56:10] PoorMansPoison: I would feel bad for my family tho...
[2:56:11] Colgaldy: It doesn't matter if it's a simulation. It's real if I'm living it.
[2:56:11] Salty_Platypus: something something Plato, the cave
[2:56:13] greasycanuk: Is the 100k tax exempt?
[2:56:15] stellatedline: utopia or like one fifth of a reasonably priced house...... HMMMMMM
[2:56:15] Othiren: 100k
[2:56:16] Oglino: fluffypandaa214 hell yeah BASED
[2:56:21] ramspaz: Anime, not going to lie RL is pretty boring
[2:56:26] omgwhatlolz: Honestly Cypher was kinda right in the matrix
[2:56:27] Squabbers: 100k. I got family here. peepoHappy
[2:56:31] Sir__Nova: Depends who controls the matrix
[2:56:31] Mag_Lev: I would take an isekai to anything setting tbh
[2:56:33] Uncertain_Fool: i would be the cause of utopia into a dystopia
[2:56:44] TheGrayPlains: @Squabbers lawlmanHeartSlide
[2:56:47] Stormblazer_: my family would miss me but i'd probably take the utopia
[2:56:47] TheRandomD_J_: bro 100k is plenty
[2:56:54] thewhiterabbi: So it's the matrix except it doesn't suck ass?
[2:56:55] Hellifyoudont66: Life's already real enough to matter, I'll take the anime utopia.
[2:56:55] BedBanana: 100k invested is actually decent  start
[2:56:56] esedelga: Anime dont have Lawman soo...
[2:56:58] SnailintheShell: 100k, I've heard how those isekai's go.
[2:57:05] fluffypandaa214: 100k can go far
[2:57:06] Morphogum: I'd rather isekai than 100k, add a 0 now we're talking
[2:57:10] Colgaldy: If it being fake doesn't make it fundamentally any different than my current life it doesn't matter.
[2:57:17] Squabbers: @TheGrayPlains Oof.. I meant my REAL family dude.. uh.. Birdge
[2:57:20] DoubleGambit13: Gimme that Matrix. I'm definitely the steak asshole
[2:57:20] Hellifyoudont66: Can't even buy a house in most of the UYS with 100k.
[2:57:21] CompulsiveOne: HUHH
[2:57:24] Mag_Lev: HUHH
[2:57:30] TyrannessBelial: 100k would solve a good amoutn of my problems
[2:57:30] Moobot: Use Code 'LAWL' for 10% off your GamerSupps! or Click Here: https://gamersupps.gg/LAWL
[2:57:43] thewhiterabbi: There isn't anyone who wouldn't take 100k.
[2:57:46] marquisecat: Teemo D:
[2:57:47] TheGrayPlains: if you're young and stable 100k is great for investing and shit
[2:57:48] Mag_Lev: Bro I am in that and I'd rather just isekai OMEGALUL
[2:57:49] ramspaz: 100K and like a decent job you are set for life
[2:57:56] BedBanana: the anime life has its perks tho, its not the easiest choice
[2:58:25] Hobo1001: arnt all anime worlds fucking meidevil shit though
[2:58:27] Hellifyoudont66: Anime utopia easy.
[2:58:28] Hobo1001: i dont wanna be a farmer
[2:58:31] AzamaraSehki: Utopian anime world sounds kind of nice right about now. But who knows in 5 years. uzuCozy
[2:58:33] Hobo1001: stripSuffer
[2:58:35] Kirmle: I mean utopia is a way better deal
[2:58:36] Colgaldy: Chat didn't think about the hot anime babes.
[2:58:39] sack02: does the anime world persist in some way after you die
[2:58:41] Mag_Lev: A utopian animal world I worth well over 100k since you don't ever have to worry about being poor in such a setting
[2:58:45] marquisecat: in an utopia id have a 100k
[2:58:48] sack02: or is it not real in the sense that it fades once you die
[2:58:49] Mag_Lev: Anime*
[2:58:52] TurquoiseC: what tier are the waifus in the anime?
[2:59:05] segan2222: based and suffering pilled
[2:59:08] SalemPulsifer: What about the idea that you make what's real?
[2:59:08] fluffypandaa214: alright chat you get 100k or you get isekaied to 40k ... tomatoConcern
[2:59:09] Oglino: yeh I dont want a fake life
[2:59:14] Oglino: I want pain and reality
[2:59:22] Hellifyoudont66: Matrix money easy.
[2:59:27] Uncertain_Fool: what is joy without suffering :)
[2:59:28] Little_Sock99: money ez
[2:59:30] Othiren: @Oglino GIGACHAD
[2:59:30] WILLIWJ: real is probably fucked, I'd take the money
[2:59:31] Broke99: Give me the real
[2:59:32] TheGrayPlains: I take the 10 mil, fuck the concept of reality vs non reality
[2:59:37] Funnymunny: 10 mil this is the only life I know
[2:59:38] Broke99: I wanna see the real
[2:59:41] jaxkmurphy: portal this place is doomed
[2:59:43] 31415man: alright chat you are in a bar and the hottest utopia comes up to you...
[2:59:43] PoorMansPoison: @Lawlman Not gonna lie the "you're in a matrix world but heres the way out" just sounds like a genie's bs to fuck with you
[2:59:45] marquisecat: My wifes pretty real so im staying with her
[2:59:56] DoubleGambit13: Real is meaningless. I decide what's real
[2:59:56] ramspaz: I want to live my Protag-kun life
[3:00:00] jaxkmurphy: portal is the correct choice as we are fucked anyway
[3:00:02] wingedillidan: anime's not real? BLUBBERS
[3:00:05] PoorMansPoison: like you're getting pranked by a fae my man
[3:00:09] Hobo1001: 10m ezz
[3:00:10] Uncertain_Fool: chat a friend offers you their arm to bbq :)
[3:00:13] thewhiterabbi: What if you step through the portal and he just says "The reality is you could of had 10 million dollars nerd."
[3:00:15] SnailintheShell: I think I'd probably chance it on the estrogen.
[3:00:16] Oglino: Uncertain_Fool I eat
[3:00:20] Rejex15: i just joined, and how good is the world through the portal
[3:00:20] SalemPulsifer: I mean : even in our world, there is no meaning in what you. You put the meaning of the world.
[3:00:26] basstieon: also just because anime is fake doesnt mean the utopia will last as a functional world an all
[3:00:27] Hobo1001: is this 2 lies and 1 truth @Lawlman modCheck
[3:00:36] SalemPulsifer: you do*
[3:00:36] marquisecat: I eat the genie offering the gamble
[3:00:36] TyrannessBelial: There's mno proof "real" is gonna be any better then what you have now.
[3:00:55] TheGrayPlains: is it morpheus offering me the pills to wake up or the hottest woman i've ever seen?
[3:00:56] ExDual: oh i thought we on irl topic talking about corporations and what not
[3:01:00] TyrannessBelial: Fuck no
[3:01:03] Kirmle: I mean both worlds are gonna suck in some way so Id rather be rich as hell
[3:01:03] Hobo1001: haha real is death OMEGALUL
[3:01:05] fluffypandaa214: god no
[3:01:06] fluffypandaa214: pls
[3:01:06] WILLIWJ: I mean if it Matrix getting out your body would be so weak
[3:01:06] Broke99: I'd wanna know
[3:01:10] SalemPulsifer: Personally I would be curious, just to see another world
[3:01:13] Oglino: I gotta know
[3:01:19] NoSweetOnlySalty: would wanna know NODDERS
[3:01:21] Hobo1001: SOYLENT GREEN IS .......
[3:01:21] sack02: honestly i think i'd be willing to drop everything
[3:01:22] TyrannessBelial: Yeah but you'll never be able to go back.
[3:01:23] Hobo1001: lawlman is that guy
[3:01:23] fluffypandaa214: i LOVE 40k but i would never go to warhammer 40k
[3:01:24] sack02: just for the curiousity
[3:01:25] SalemPulsifer: Not caring about the reality of it
[3:01:27] Fr0stWulf: Fr0stWulf subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! wowzers 2 whole years, thanks for the great content and comfy vibes lawmie lawlmanHeart
[3:01:31] Hobo1001: lawlman is the guy who hates SOYLENT GREEN Madge
[3:01:38] WILLIWJ: problem is death doesn't save you in 40K
[3:01:53] SalemPulsifer: @WILLIWJ EVEN IN DEATH, YOU STILL SERVE
[3:01:57] Rejex15: id probably take the 10m, i like my potentially fake life, and real world might suck ass
[3:01:58] Othiren: @Fr0stWulf Welcome to the diamond club donkWalk
[3:01:59] PoorMansPoison: double no ban?!
[3:02:00] ExDual: goes through the portal and there's a trex just starring at me
[3:02:02] PoorMansPoison: oh god
[3:02:09] TheAntLion: isn't this just a weebier version of the greek philosophy about being too stubborn to leave your cave?
[3:02:22] Fr0stWulf: @Othiren hell yeah brother donkWalk
[3:02:27] TyrannessBelial: Knowledge and meaning has no meaning without purpose or accomplishment.
[3:02:35] Colgaldy: But what if that is just another layer in another matrix, the "knowing what is real" argument doesn't really make sense because you can't actually know that. It can always go further and you can't prove it doesn't. Whether we are in a matrix or not doesn't change the reality of existence.
[3:02:35] Moobot: Merch is live! Check out all the cool stuff at https://lawlman.com/
[3:02:36] Broke99: IT ALL GOES BACK TO THE ARM BBQ
[3:02:39] fluffypandaa214: 40k you have to survive as a guardsmen for 3 weeks if you do you get paradise
[3:02:44] Broke99: IT ALWAYS GOES BACK TO EATING PEOPLE
[3:02:45] Uncertain_Fool: ARM BBQ TheVoices
[3:02:49] Rejex15: @fluffypandaa214 NOPERS
[3:02:51] sack02: i hear smoulder is pretty good this patch
[3:02:58] Othiren: @Broke99 every time Despairge
[3:02:59] basstieon: rare pyke LETSGO
[3:03:04] SalemPulsifer: @Colgaldy basically, as Di Caprio said : We need to go deeper
[3:03:06] Fr0stWulf: bossman does love his armbeque
[3:03:13] 31415man: @TheAntLion Plato's allegory of the cave
[3:03:16] Broke99: I'm agreeing with you lawlman I'm just sayin CHAT ALWAYS TAKES IT BACK TO THE ARM BBQ
[3:03:19] WILLIWJ: Rick and Morty did an episode about it funny enough
[3:03:22] barbadosblackbelly: finally a stream for cannibals
[3:03:23] Broke99: WE CAN NEVER ESCAPE
[3:03:27] TyrannessBelial: Yeah problem isd everything is always real on all levels cus of how vast existence is, being shown a greater level you can\'t in any meaningful way interact with and would die to is basically choosing to die if you can't be god.
[3:03:30] CompulsiveOne: time to peepoRun
[3:03:31] NoSweetOnlySalty: BASED chat
[3:03:31] ramspaz: I will say that this chat talks about eating people a lot
[3:03:36] sack02: @WILLIWJ about arm barbecues?
[3:03:41] ExDual: damn he painted the town red
[3:04:20] Colgaldy: But whether it is fake or real doesn't change anything is my point.
[3:04:20] Moobot: Don't forget to drink water, especially you @lawlman! >:(
[3:04:26] WILLIWJ: @sack02 people dying and there organs turning into delicious spaghetti
[3:04:29] SalemPulsifer: But ... what "real" means?
[3:04:33] Rejex15: But would you be willing to leave behind friends and family to discover what is real? You may find new friends/family but would you even know them?
[3:04:33] Moobot: Roc is here for two things and two things only. Your channel points, and soul.
[3:04:42] TyrannessBelial: @Lawlman I'd rather figure it out and accomplish discovering that of my own accord, rather then be given it for free, so I can be ready and accept the truth.
[3:05:03] geggidy: Rakan gaming coxThirst
[3:05:05] 31415man: The other wrinkle is that you then know that there exists an omnipotent being
[3:05:22] SalemPulsifer: NICE TRY ROBOT
[3:05:28] SalemPulsifer: Humans are awesome!
[3:05:31] WILLIWJ: @TyrannessBelial that is adding buildup to the potential dread
[3:05:43] fluffypandaa214: i believe in humans spirit to win
[3:05:45] Othiren: THE INDOMITABLE HUMAN SPIRIT LETSGO
[3:05:46] Rejex15: I think if you didnt take the deal it would eat at you that the reality you are living is not real
[3:05:52] SalemPulsifer: RAW RAW, FIGHT THE POWER
[3:05:54] Oglino: LETSGO HUMANITY
[3:06:05] SalemPulsifer: SEE THE INVISIBLE
[3:06:05] Colgaldy: Like, you said you can't know what is on the other side. It could be entirely identical. There can't be any fundamental difference in what is real or fake.
[3:06:06] Fr0stWulf: OMEGALUL
[3:06:07] Gagey_wagey: @Lawlman is he omnipotent and omnipotent?
[3:06:08] Oglino: OMEGALUL
[3:06:10] SalemPulsifer: DO THE IMPOSSIBLE
[3:06:11] Oglino: HAHAHA
[3:06:12] CompulsiveOne: fat OMEGALUL
[3:06:16] Salty_Platypus: it was the Fat that did it
[3:06:20] TheAntLion: you find out the world was written by chatgpt and you don't want to live anymore NotLikeThis
[3:06:21] Gagey_wagey: all knowing*
[3:06:27] Oglino: SAME
[3:06:31] Oglino: its fucked
[3:06:31] PoorMansPoison: HE'S BIG BONED
[3:06:32] shifty_ai: fuck dat
[3:06:34] Salty_Platypus: because thats insulting 90%% of riots player base
[3:06:37] TyrannessBelial: The existence of one omnipotent being implies the possibility of more and even more possibilities of extradimensional beings. That's enough for me to want to work towards it on my own.
[3:06:38] Gagey_wagey: Omnipotent and omniscient*
[3:06:40] WILLIWJ: if I met an Omnipotent being I would nope the fuck out so I didn't get erased
[3:06:45] Melamamoduro: Fat people are some that get offended the most and report the most
[3:06:53] TyrannessBelial: A sapient beiong's curiousity will always move forward.
[3:06:53] ExDual: that gets you banned?! wtf
[3:07:16] SalemPulsifer: Because banned words are based upon human created lists and it might be that the Riot list didn't have that specific slur
[3:07:16] Rejex15: i feel like thats totally something an omnipotent being would propose, just to fuck with some random mortal's head
[3:07:17] Salty_Platypus: you go after the obese and you go after riots income
[3:07:19] WILLIWJ: it's not Blitz's fault he so rotund
[3:07:39] barbadosblackbelly: not allowed to eat good while playing league Sadge

[3:08:34] sack02: it's still the same for the adc
[3:08:37] Kirmle: Oh I see

[3:08:40] barbadosblackbelly: oh
[3:08:40] SalemPulsifer: but it's disappointing
[3:08:44] uppenchamp: Isn't this just his real band
[3:09:07] uppenchamp: His voice is so sick
[3:09:13] Othiren: @PoorMansPoison You gonna share with chat? Stare
[3:09:20] 31415man: Plus the confirmation that there  is an absolute "truth"
