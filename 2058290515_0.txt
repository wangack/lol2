[4:52:54] Rose06012: @Liefbread no he gets my money every month he cant have more
[4:52:56] peepeelad69: 1.3 k
[4:52:58] nastymeme123: !zwag
[4:52:58] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[4:53:00] peepeelad69: pekin growing holyy
[4:53:00] Lanvira: @19yruj I never play those Champs and actively hate em. But just for fun I did one Game of Yasuo in Ranked and won the game 19/2

[4:57:53] frozennyogurt: xdd
[4:57:53] lolcrestfallen: @shintoaliengod yes, but that’s normal. For the ones that can actually play against him, they don’t know how.
[4:57:54] CUBErt_: counterpoint: you wont even need to train it
[4:57:56] dankdude179: oo oo aa aa

[4:58:43] alien1388: and still some people thinks the champ is not op and bad
[4:58:45] frozennyogurt: i think im worse than a monkey i do bad with yone
[4:58:49] dankdude179: mfw monkey is better than me
[4:58:57] curator_davies: I feel like you come back here
[4:58:58] sebrebacitta: I was part of project yone in Florida, we couldn't get the monkey to set the runes but went 6-7 average as yone
[4:59:06] B3K1ND: the fact that he gets faster with his E is insane. Should slow down the further away her gets from his spirit
[4:59:11] StrawberryPopSharts: he transcended and no longer needs his trail to find his body
[4:59:11] hewhocomz: WAIT THATS BUSTED TF
[4:59:13] galleys_: @sebrebacitta better than most yone players
[4:59:17] galleys_: :(
[4:59:27] dankdude179: lets go
[4:59:29] 19yruj: @B3K1ND yes, this would actually make the skill balanced
[4:59:35] dankdude179: only needed three people cc chaining him
[4:59:35] killer52183: brand incoming
[4:59:42] Lanvira: Wait, Yone R goes through Taliyah Ground without getting cc'd?
[4:59:47] killer52183: brand boosting this trash yone
[4:59:49] curator_davies: as a yone main I think yone is the hardest champ in the game
[4:59:50] turtletheturtle: gn !!!!
[4:59:52] 19yruj: @Lanvira yeah only gets stunned after
[4:59:56] Lanvira: @Lanvira ICANT

[5:00:55] just4goat: I've been wondering this for a while, but why isn't Machamp or Mr.Mime in your tags? @PekinWoof
[5:00:56] onlym1lfs: he travels the 14th dimension its not a flash
[5:00:57] StrawberryPopSharts: the only thing crazier that i've seen in a cage in the undertaker in 1998
[5:00:58] galleys_: @lolcrestfallen yea but that doesnt mean it should be implemented into the game in terms of balance :(
[5:01:00] dankdude179: CatDrive
[5:01:01] pinkvalvet: he's faster than matter itself
[5:01:02] sebrebacitta: do you think it's intentional to have a braindead champ tho? inclusive to part of the population that was unlucky
[5:01:06] ChadingoYitten: @jpressie my name is lore now
[5:01:08] hewhocomz: its basically flash no
[5:01:10] Lanvira: There 1000% is a Yone Main in the balancing team, this shit is not real
[5:01:15] POLVUZ: lolcrestfallen as a lore nerd, fuck the lore
[5:01:18] killer52183: zac and tris cant even jump over veigar cage, riot for real is cooking
[5:01:20] jpressie: ChadingoYitten pekinGasm
[5:01:23] shintoaliengod: the inconsistent lore that gets retconned all the time KEKWait
[5:01:24] Unilateralis: @Lanvira i dont doubt it

[5:02:35] jpressie: @POLVUZ just punch him in the balls
[5:02:36] StrawberryPopSharts: @POLVUZ dragon atheism i think is the only way to fight a dragon god
[5:02:38] sebrebacitta: @Unilateralis it's legit why you should never be upset by dumb people. they had no choice in the matter and they suffer from it
[5:02:45] nuttyytft: like this fight lets throwdown asol

[5:03:58] POLVUZ: StrawberryPopSharts amen
[5:04:02] dankdude179: PEKW
[5:04:03] orchxstra1: i swear yone e i just a more frustrating leblanc w
[5:04:09] BlueSNS: @POLVUZ i can always find asol's balls on yo jaws

[5:04:36] Pandabuhh: @orchxstra1 nah its not even the same, lb can get cc'd to the point she wont be able to go back
[5:04:36] POLVUZ: ChadingoYitten its always lurking in the dark
[5:04:41] ChadingoYitten: monkaW
[5:04:42] kirbyoncrak: when urf @pekinwoof
[5:04:52] POLVUZ: BlueSNS make it kayn's
[5:05:07] 19yruj: @orchxstra1 its so funny to me that when they changed crit items last season yone was weak for like a day and then they buffed him xdd
[5:05:09] orchxstra1: @Pandabuhh thats why i said its more frustrating, like at least leblanc can get cc'd and oneshot but yone? unstoppable if he presses the button
[5:05:12] pinkvalvet: but brand ate u up not yone, he's too fed
[5:05:15] POLVUZ: @510irv Nerdge
[5:05:16] dankdude179: urf is just a who has hard cc wins
[5:05:18] kirbyoncrak: ur boring madge
[5:05:23] kirbyoncrak: deal
[5:05:24] StrawberryPopSharts: collab time
[5:05:29] ChadingoYitten: @quantum can u play urf now
[5:05:38] Ocram_3D: Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
[5:05:40] orchxstra1: idk i still think the best way to balance yone is to make his e last less time and make it so q3 and e can't go over walls the same way riven q can't
[5:05:43] jpressie: @quantum can you play urf now
[5:05:45] lolcrestfallen: playing against Yone as a ranged champ is more fun
[5:05:45] orchxstra1: unless you use riven q3
[5:05:53] galleys_: @orchxstra1 riven q can
[5:05:59] galleys_: oh ok mb i didnt see ur 2nd part
[5:06:03] orchxstra1: yeah mb
[5:06:09] POLVUZ: the best way to balance yone is deleting him from everything execpt lor
[5:06:10] galleys_: but then again thats riven q3 and that'd also be yone q3
[5:06:10] Pandabuhh: @orchxstra1 yea exactly, at least lb has counterplay or she needs to play around certain cd's, yone could just go in, play like an ape and just dip if he knows he fked up
[5:06:10] dankdude179: is serpent fang okaydge for yone?
[5:06:16] kirbyoncrak: btw is really refreshing seeing u playing assassins
[5:06:21] ChadingoYitten: @POLVUZ yone in lor is the goat hes still alive too
[5:06:36] ChadingoYitten: zac stop shoving pekinGasm
[5:06:37] orchxstra1: @Pandabuhh not to mention he can just spam w off cd for free poke
[5:06:43] shintoaliengod: qiyana feels like she should've been AP
[5:06:50] ChadingoYitten: monkaW
[5:06:51] POLVUZ: ChadingoYitten and he legimately looks like an old man
[5:06:58] POLVUZ: instead of a 17yo
[5:07:00] 510irv: @polvuz don’t blame me, blame the devs KEKW Aware
[5:07:02] orchxstra1: like he doesn't even need the shield for survivability
[5:07:06] ChadingoYitten: dying makes u younger nowoted
[5:07:15] POLVUZ: 510irv fuck em riot
[5:07:25] Pandabuhh: @orchxstra1 nah bro everytime i face a yone, it just makes me mad. literally can play like an ape, q w skills are so low cd and his e is so forgivable. it aint just fun to play against
[5:07:28] dankdude179: more like akali
[5:07:32] FloatingBrick_: AINTNOWAY hes gonna try ap qiyana
[5:07:37] dankdude179: stealth high dmg mobile

[5:41:31] naysmanac: isnt zwag challenger every season on xerath?

[5:41:48] ChadingoYitten: !fart
[5:41:48] Nightbot: Pekin has farted 365 times on stream DansGame
[5:41:51] Lanvira: !zwag
[5:41:51] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting
[5:41:52] dankdude179: ur lux vids was what got me into you pekin
[5:41:52] saikysantos: Lux was played recently
