[2:14:49] andre123654789: Late bet for Blue Team nutBlue nutBlue nutBlue
[2:15:04] Treebeard64: i.e. being a higher % muscle 165, or being 180
[2:15:08] Rainey719: I will also like to mention, I have yet to play any champ but Diana and one ekko comm since new items came out

[2:55:41] chillbx: @youngbustin thanks for the advice man
[2:55:42] youngbustin: @chillbx You call that advice? It's more like a desperate cry for help. But don't worry, I'll turn it into a life lesson: Remember, seeking advice is a sign of strength, not weakness.
[2:55:51] imthatShaunguy: Gay's don't have a weakness to strong women like us straights @Bustin
