[2:19:43] sololanediff: @kirbyzilla1 probably more of a “what’s average at 10, 15, 20 minutes for stacks?” Since you get more stacks per minute later than you do early.

[2:24:19] hellarobottv: I wish his q didnt scale with crit because then I think youd go like 2-3 lethality items and then full AP
[2:24:24] PaciPhists: i voted nope but i do hope u win
[2:24:25] kncttv: but e is not for damage mainly?
