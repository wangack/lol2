[0:38:10] Nexusshade: how should I play against a jungle kayn? or where should I ward to counter him?
[0:38:18] Forged__: @Livic_28 stfu, I tried to get tickets to Paris and they were full 3 months in advance

[0:40:22] Forged__: wait you're gonna cast jet-lagged?
[0:40:38] Nexusshade: is there any different wards against champs that can go over walls than the ones that don't?
[0:40:41] wuddlin: do they allow Medic to cast BDS games
[0:41:11] Livic_28: @Livic_28 ps: I see you requesting the "softer" songs ahahha
[0:41:19] hup3nharry: Top of the Morning Guys
[0:41:21] Forged__: @Nexusshade I just know when I play top on blue side I put one in the corner next to red side tower vs kayne and rek
[0:41:27] crispytain: BONK hyli mode
[0:41:39] Nexusshade: Forged__ ooh thank you ^^
[0:41:47] FrostSJ: lmao "caster guy"
[0:42:00] Forged__: @Nexusshade but the best wards vs this and stealth champs are deep ward in their jungle
[0:42:33] Nexusshade: true
[0:42:44] hopfer: Medic how's rakan for you after all these recent changes? Any significant difference?
[0:43:16] Forged__: @Nexusshade and best advice I've ever gotten is "dont die to jungle". It's a dumb advice, but it means be aware of their pathing.
[0:43:52] Nexusshade: Forged__ and that is what I'm trying to learn with where to place wards ^^
[0:44:37] Forged__: @Nexusshade even without wards. Like jungler started red on red side, means he will most likely be top lvl 3, I should either not push, or crash as fast so it can bounce and be safe
[0:44:57] Forged__: (for top I mean(
[0:45:06] Nexusshade: yeh I play both top and adc
[0:45:28] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
