[0:01:12] razer_mon: monkas
[0:01:18] razer_mon: 1st ALWAYS
[0:01:30] razer_mon: ipavChad ipavChad
[0:03:03] Suicidallangel: hello ipav is the build ready LUL
[0:03:23] LtChezo: looking cute today chat
[0:03:27] 291x: xddteemo
[0:04:43] razer_mon: @suicidallangel it will be ready in thousand years from now on ipavChad
[0:05:16] Suicidallangel: hahaha i know its just my welcome sentence
[0:09:31] Lazynameross: RabbitArrive
[0:09:51] Lazynameross: eh? no duolingo time first?
[0:11:34] Lazynameross: nah cuz the 2 2 2
[0:11:44] Lazynameross: last strem end not on a lingo 2
[0:12:07] Lazynameross: oo
[0:12:36] KarmicKnight: Usually when it gets to duolingo time I do lose a bit of interest
[0:12:56] KarmicKnight: It's interesting for a little bit but it fades
[0:13:46] TexasChess: Ni howdy
[0:13:47] KarmicKnight: Also I understand why you stopped posting youtube videos LUL chat was insufferable yesterday after you posted a game
[0:15:33] EsseNs_: bro stop theory crafting and wasting time. It doesnt matter what build you play on teemo, its how you play it mechanically through lane management etc. You can play 4 masks build and still be challenger. This is pointless AD wont ever work
[0:16:46] KarmicKnight: Theory crafting is part of the fun, let ipav enjoy it while it lasts
[0:17:02] Lazynameross: oo i didnt check my yt feed, so what happened after vid? arguments about content?
[0:17:16] KarmicKnight: @Lazynameross just a bunch of immature people came to stream
[0:17:21] TexasChess: Ipav’s builds aren’t random. They’re calculated. Sealed with his approval and guarantee of success.
[0:17:26] KarmicKnight: nothing terrible, but it definitely threw off the vibe
[0:17:43] EsseNs_: if you think your AD teemo works, why arent you half as popular as Alan lol
[0:18:01] ilduce118: hi ipav u have tips for teemo as a support?
[0:18:06] Lazynameross: so like this guy lol
[0:18:16] EsseNs_: 1-1
[0:18:16] KarmicKnight: @Lazynameross Yeah basically
[0:18:23] ayhow_: peepoClimbDown
[0:18:51] razer_mon: peepoClimbDown
[0:19:42] xxpops: agree
[0:19:52] xxpops: specially if going qss
[0:20:12] 291x: peepoLegs Yepge glizzyL
[0:21:19] xxpops: ya not fan of kraken
[0:22:10] KarmicKnight: I know black cleaver is bad, but how would it perform instead of terminus?
[0:23:13] KarmicKnight: Yeah that makes sense
[0:23:20] xxpops: huge
[0:23:24] xxpops: 150 dif
[0:23:48] LtChezo: its an unfair competition for kraken, they recently changed it so its a big 1st item powerspike, its got higher base dmg and little scaling now
[0:23:52] xxpops: jakshow or stopwatch can be swapped per game
[0:24:12] KarmicKnight: I guess black cleaver would only be good in team fights cause it would give more value to teammates
[0:24:30] xxpops: crit is kinda wasted stat @ltchezo is why im not fan of that item
[0:26:46] KarmicKnight: I remember all those games where you shroomed enemy base from dragon pit LUL
[0:28:03] xxpops: hybrid my favorite i think
[0:28:07] SzDredd: teetoHi
[0:28:16] xxpops: to watch
[0:28:32] 291x: i love you ipav widepeepoHappyRightHeart
[0:29:43] LtChezo: its considered only good to build kraken 1st item
[0:30:16] LtChezo: less ap tho
[0:30:22] tarzanedfan10000000000000: whats up bro
[0:30:25] mate6868: malignance is op
[0:31:23] EsseNs_: +5 AD and AP on rage
[0:32:24] Lazynameross: no lol
[0:33:45] xxpops: teemo got q bug fix idk if know @ipav999
[0:33:59] xxpops: first auto sometimes hit
[0:34:14] xxpops: its in patch
[0:34:18] tootetsu: yes
[0:35:21] tootetsu: And a Riot dev said in his stream they will reduce the cd nerf of teemo r by a few seconds because nerf hit too hard
[0:35:37] tootetsu: probebly next patch
[0:36:10] CAIDENTR: ResidentSleeper
[0:39:10] be_sanity: morde used flesh too
[0:39:19] Suicidallangel: famous west server streamer challenger teemo goes swifties everygame almost
[0:39:58] tootetsu: qss vs morde?
[0:40:27] Kenwood502: Those swifties worth their price in gold
[0:41:08] Lazynameross: what is going on with ez
[0:42:47] Lazynameross: phew
[0:42:57] Kenwood502: not even close
[0:43:00] Suicidallangel: not even closeee
[0:43:22] Lazynameross: realm ending almost killed you lol
[0:43:41] Kenwood502: was good til samira E into tower LOL
[0:43:50] Kenwood502: not sure why she did that
[0:44:04] Kenwood502: AVENGERS assembled
[0:44:13] Apachew: PogChamp
[0:44:45] Suicidallangel: means ad
[0:46:43] Lazynameross: ori no
[0:47:15] razer_mon: MONK EM
[0:50:00] Lazynameross: mk
[0:50:34] Lazynameross: rip
[0:50:38] KarmicKnight: so close
[0:52:46] razer_mon: now u can 1v1 her?
[0:53:05] KarmicKnight: It would still be scary, she's quite strong
[0:54:05] EsseNs_: teemo loses against any decent duelist mid/late
[0:54:27] Suicidallangel: irelia is disgasting pick
[0:54:41] razer_mon: need heal cut
[0:55:41] razer_mon: KEKW
[0:55:44] trebish: he's a newer champion
[0:55:50] HueHefner: right...
[0:55:54] Lazynameross: does surge give ms
[0:55:56] LtChezo: how many cloud drakes they got?
[0:55:57] razer_mon: always stupid
[0:56:04] HueHefner: new car op smell
[0:56:05] Autisymous: they have an entire cloud dragon
[0:56:08] sam___55: I miss league when the inner turrets were lazers
[0:56:55] Autisymous: yeah one entire cloud dragon KEKHeim
[0:57:16] tootetsu: teemo W is overrated rn
[0:57:25] HueHefner: i miss lv 1 w on olaf with ignite smite and lifesteal scepter. with full atk speed runes. unkillable lv 1
[0:57:31] razer_mon: every champ movement speed dont makes sense at all
[0:57:39] tootetsu: i hope they change it when the visual update comes out
[0:57:45] razer_mon: like ww is somehow slower
[0:58:24] theycallmeBrain: teemo have shorter legs. he doesnt have the pendulum to cover the distance, so while his move speed may be high, it isn't compensated for further distances like GIGACHAD 7foot monolith knight morde EZ
[0:58:37] razer_mon: heal cut
[0:58:39] qtzzu: ipavSip
[0:58:56] HueHefner: at least irelia doesnt get played as much as she used too
[0:59:23] KarmicKnight: I seen so many Hwei players a while ago
[0:59:33] Suicidallangel: irelia is a ban along with casiopia disquasting

[1:16:01] KarmicKnight: yeah xin was below gromp 2 seconds after malph ulted
[1:16:26] Lazynameross: i forget if teemos has a special name but its not like twitch/eve
[1:17:13] Lazynameross: worth
[1:18:15] SpaghettiEnthousiast: teemo passive is invisibility, not camouflage
[1:18:37] SzDredd: ri ptwitch
[1:18:41] KarmicKnight: Don't forget teemo's second passive, global taunt that guaranteed enemy jungle ganks you Kappa

[1:56:14] papysanchez: Ye ye it was so nice
[1:56:22] papysanchez: Why he stoped
[1:56:44] KarmicKnight: Not sure, might have just gotten tired of doing it
[1:56:58] razer_mon: grubs are useless
