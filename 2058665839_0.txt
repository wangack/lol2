[0:49:11] Nightbot: Autolykus - https://www.op.gg/multisearch/na?summoners=AutoLykus%23NA1%2CAutoDlykus%23NA1
[0:49:23] RiptidexRiltreks: @bigolanimeboob have to kill him early to get an item lead or he will get items and win hard.
[0:49:53] RiptidexRiltreks: a really good way to achieve that is to force a lvl 1 trade with W @bigolanimeboob and try to catch him while hes low
[0:49:59] zagreus7274: I got u on the fridge now auto aut0Prayge
[0:50:19] RiptidexRiltreks: dont eat Q's
[0:50:25] RiptidexRiltreks: wtf this guy sounds like dio
[0:50:27] spamnut64: congrats on chall
[0:50:36] RiptidexRiltreks: dio but english
[0:50:39] bigolanimeboob: I've seen that, once he grabs Riftmaker its kinda "Play passive until teamfight phase or you die" for me
[0:50:42] RiptidexRiltreks: bless you
[0:50:46] Brock0Lee69: Salud
[0:51:08] RiptidexRiltreks: @bigolanimeboob remember that your Ult is unstoppable and suppression. so you can actually cancel his R with your R if you're ready for it
[0:51:25] bigolanimeboob: Didnt actually know that!
[0:51:51] RiptidexRiltreks: yep, if he walks up like he wants to R you, you can just say "fuck you" and he gets 0 value out of it
[0:52:36] RiptidexRiltreks: the safest way is to not fight and buy a qss then farm/scale. but thats kinda aut0Deadge
[0:53:06] RiptidexRiltreks: another weakpoint I noticed I had was when he used his W I panicked and used my W but you can delay it a bit cuz you still have sett passive @bigolanimeboob
[0:54:34] RiptidexRiltreks: lmao @AutolykusLoL
[0:54:48] RiptidexRiltreks: thats what makes elden ring hard for so many ppl
[0:54:52] RiptidexRiltreks: is never leveling vigor
[0:54:54] Hinata_San8: morning auto aut0W
[0:55:21] RiptidexRiltreks: elden ring boss will stat check you later in the game
[0:55:31] RiptidexRiltreks: unless you no-hit
[0:55:32] label939: borpaChatting borpaChatting borpaChatting
[0:55:37] bigolanimeboob: Yeah, I could play Susan if I wanted to farm win, I play Sett to fight. aut0G Right now I'm gold one trying to OTP Sett to emerald+, but it feels like if I win lane my team loses, if I lose lane the enemy Top just dominates the game.

[0:55:49] label939: peepoHeadbang peepoHeadbang
[0:56:11] RiptidexRiltreks: @bigolanimeboob have to pretty much play starcraft as low elo toplaner + win lane
[0:56:21] RiptidexRiltreks: command your units (teammates) to avoid death
[0:56:40] RiptidexRiltreks: and also make good rotations to claim bounties
[0:56:54] label939: LOOK AT HIM RUN LIKE A COWARD aut0Jojo
[0:57:30] zagreus7274: He's just spamming the same move aut0Clown
[0:57:37] bigolanimeboob: Normally it all goes good until the 10/0 Mid floats top with the Supp and Jungle, and I get dived. I just hope things change in higher elo.
[0:58:24] RiptidexRiltreks: @bigolanimeboob thats the thing, you kinda have to kill that midlaner before that 10/0 happens or you will always lose all those kinds of games
[0:58:31] zagreus7274: Sounds like clown can only use 1 attack aut0M
[0:58:38] RiptidexRiltreks: im speaking from experience losing those games
[0:58:48] RiptidexRiltreks: and the times I win I killed them
[0:58:59] bigolanimeboob: Yeah, I'm still learning the timing and queues for floating around more.
[0:59:26] bigolanimeboob: I feel like my biggest weakness is my understanding of the little things, wave management, map awareness, and so on.
[1:00:22] zaid_2030: hello ( came here bcoz my acc got banned for 2 weeks )
[1:00:37] bigolanimeboob: @zaid_2030 ????
[1:00:52] zaid_2030: they tilted me and i trolled
[1:01:01] RiptidexRiltreks: @bigolanimeboob simple wave guide is 4 or more leftover is a freeze. try to keep under 7. (if you can, always shove before objs) map awareness is a skill you just have to build. looking at map the whole time while you play
[1:01:49] RiptidexRiltreks: freeze times are, when you have an advantage in health or items, or are trying to create a gank for your jg @bigolanimeboob
[1:01:59] zaid_2030: @bigolanimeboob our jg tilted me and i trolled so i got banned for 2 weeeks
[1:02:12] RiptidexRiltreks: well if you trolled that deserved KEKHeim
[1:02:14] zagreus7274: @bigolanimeboob u can definitely make it otp sett to like emerald+ which I've done
[1:02:24] zagreus7274: And I'm in emerald rn as well only otp sett
[1:02:32] bigolanimeboob: I'm watching a bunch of high elo top games and trying to soak up as much as possible, like a sponge and all that.
[1:02:32] zagreus7274: I'm top 50 NA sett
[1:03:43] RiptidexRiltreks: hotfix nerf?
[1:03:46] xXFaze_DankXx: did they
[1:03:49] RiptidexRiltreks: i thought it was a real patch
[1:03:54] bigolanimeboob: I think adjusted? More HP but less AD
[1:03:58] RiptidexRiltreks: from 6 seconds to 15?
[1:03:58] bigolanimeboob: Iirc
[1:04:31] zagreus7274: I'm surprised u don't ban aatrox cause he will literally be in every game
[1:04:38] bigolanimeboob: Or am I thinking of Stride? I know it got a big change
[1:05:14] zagreus7274: Isn't rn aatrox more popular
[1:05:17] xXFaze_DankXx: im glad riot buffed jax he really needed it
[1:05:21] xXFaze_DankXx: weak champion
[1:05:29] xXFaze_DankXx: :)
[1:05:42] zagreus7274: Yea he is
[1:05:42] tezi777: @xXFaze_DankXx no way
[1:05:45] Mann1_Max: IN your opinion is mordekaiser stronger than sett this season ?
[1:05:51] bigolanimeboob: Jax was weak or is that sarcasm? High elo plays like a different game imo
[1:06:08] zagreus7274: We gonna buff S+++ tier Champs cause they no strong
[1:06:15] xXFaze_DankXx: I think the smiley face expresses my sarcasm
[1:06:20] RiptidexRiltreks: @tezi777 there is no jax buff right
[1:06:30] RiptidexRiltreks: right now*
[1:06:35] RiptidexRiltreks: yall got baited
[1:06:37] RiptidexRiltreks: KEKHeim
[1:06:44] xXFaze_DankXx: he got buffed earlier this season
[1:06:52] zagreus7274: aut0Clown
