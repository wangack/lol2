[3:04:35] springrollnoodle: my temper could never
[3:04:41] just_vibin_wit_you: nothing happens when you report. i dunno why people act like it is such a big deal. like, every other game someone is reporting someone
[3:04:51] kyraaleesong: To be fairrrrr Olaf ate everyone's tushie hehe
[3:04:53] softlysupports: reporting definitely works wat elisEeer
[3:05:06] PharmDRPh: if mid just asked "is it ok if i ban" game prob goes differently
[3:05:10] springrollnoodle: @softlysupports indeed
[3:05:11] Jakmo: I get a lot of report feedbacks, it's about what you report and how often
[3:05:13] ydet: Happy Lunar New Year!!
[3:05:17] archimedes_9: @softlysupports monkey?? eavWow
[3:05:28] BaneBladeV: reporting works but 99% of the time it's verbal. I rarely see it working for inting
[3:05:33] just_vibin_wit_you: @Jakmo right, but those players still play the game and do the same thing
[3:05:41] softlysupports: @softlysupports not quite that word hehe
[3:05:54] PharmDRPh: poppy support waiting room
[3:05:58] Jakmo: nah, not always. people shouldn't be permad for a bad day or two regardless
[3:05:59] avuloseunda: Reporting definitely works c:. Not sure about inting report but toxic report works. I got like a report feedback instantly after i reported a toxic player. Like just barely 1 minute after i reported
[3:06:04] softlysupports: thankfully most inters cant help typing nyaMhm
[3:06:10] springrollnoodle: @banebladeuwu i think a lot of ppl report ppl just having a bad game for inting too tho
[3:06:25] just_vibin_wit_you: @avuloseunda go back and check what that player is doing now. guarantee it is exactly the same thing
[3:06:32] kyraaleesong: Reporting toxic language and bm goes through so fast
[3:06:44] avuloseunda: I only report toxic people and rage quitters hehe
[3:06:44] kyraaleesong: But inting in the game going 0/10 takes longer
[3:06:48] kyraaleesong: Sadge.
[3:06:53] avuloseunda: @just_vibin_wit_you truee lourThump

[7:37:19] ChromaKhroma: Learning
[7:37:37] Lazynameross: 75s cd rank 1 lol
[7:37:59] lugubrieuzz: azhaiasiam meh, if you knew time it takes to respawn it's pretty easy to know, i don't think its rly that bad imo
[7:38:29] Lazynameross: you get the dots on the map naturally if you see it die
[7:38:47] Lazynameross: if its still telling without vision thats an issue and should be banned
[7:39:07] lugubrieuzz: ^
[7:39:16] azhaiasiam: @lugubrieuzz theres a skill gap issue. see i learned the timing. and its not by the exact second. wheres as 3rd party apps show you the excact second they respond. if you were blind you wouldnt know if the camp has been taken or not.
[7:39:17] lugubrieuzz: yea that would constitute scripting
[7:39:31] Lazynameross: if you can manually ping it after counting enemy cs or whatever thats fine too
[7:40:05] lugubrieuzz: top laner is top laning as they do
[7:41:41] pIasmate: you have no mid nor top
[7:43:03] pIasmate: akshan always dies with ult, rumble either misses his ult or misuses it, rip
[7:43:37] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[7:43:43] Hook123: Viktor really thought your ult was on cd
[7:44:27] pIasmate: akshan died with ult again lol
[7:44:35] pIasmate: 4 or 5 times now
[7:46:02] pIasmate: hard to play without a top or mid
