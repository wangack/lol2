[5:41:15] mypreppydiaries: Come to London
[5:41:17] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: AP smolder can be situationally better depending on the game/op in lane. If you are just going to default to one build those, do AD.

[5:42:42] Katajanmarjq: I live in finland and its been -30 for a week straight, 1 bike 8km to work everyday :P
[5:42:44] didistetter: DinkDonk chat if you're european remember he's talking farenheit NOT CELSIUS
[5:42:46] CoyoteTina: negative anything is cold, miserable cold too
[5:42:50] Joker_GGEZ: im unsubbign and unfollowing
[5:42:52] 9fierce9: Imagine not living in absolute zero every day SMH
[5:42:58] youareallsobeutyful: i kinda got to agree with joker
[5:42:59] Joker_GGEZ: @didistetter hes talking celsius
[5:43:01] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Yeah, speaking as someone that lives somewhere hot and humid once you get down to skin, if you are still hot.... you just get to be hot and sweaty. Cold you can layer, and blanket, and share warmth with people, and heat up a water bottle etc.
[5:43:04] Januous: THATS NOTHINGGGGGGG
[5:43:07] coolwaveofcalm: -2 in Farenheit is nothing
[5:43:08] FreeXe: Cold depends of the humidity. Trust. I live in north Canada
[5:43:10] didistetter: no joker he is saying -15 farenheit
[5:43:12] superfreak123: oh -2 F isn't that cold tbh
[5:43:13] Januous: IT GOT COLDER THAN ANTARCTICA HERE
[5:43:16] mypreppydiaries: ahhh, that explains
[5:43:19] CoyoteTina: It got down to -24 F here back in January. THat shit sucked
[5:43:24] Joker_GGEZ: no he checked it in celsius stett lol
[5:43:26] lsdjesus420: -19c is cold
[5:43:27] Joker_GGEZ: -2 in fahrenheir
[5:43:29] Januous: COLDER. THAN ANTARCTICA
[5:43:31] jeskieKAT: peepoSit can someone translate to non-american please
[5:43:39] hope_spl: you have to realize that -2 F would be cold to the vast majority of the people in the world, even if specifically in your area maybe its not that bad lol
[5:43:47] coolwaveofcalm: I would go to school in the morning when I was a kid and it would be -10 Fahrenheit
[5:43:47] Joker_GGEZ: ok now he's talking fahrenheit
[5:43:51] didistetter: anything above 90 feels like death
[5:44:04] Joker_GGEZ: @hope_spl id tell the vast majority of the people in the world to grow a pair then
[5:44:07] didistetter: dry heat 95 is tolerable
[5:44:09] OneSmugFrog: it depends on the wind as well
[5:44:14] youareallsobeutyful: where i like -35c is a yearly thing and -20c is not really that cold
[5:44:15] didistetter: but with humidity anything above 90 is death
[5:44:16] CoyoteTina: naaa. Lived in TX for 3 yrs, that was rough heat, cause it was humid too. TX 115 vs Afghanistan 115 were very different temperatures
[5:44:17] 9fierce9: 5up complain about the queue to get into a game
[5:44:18] niightdancer: Everything above 80 is way to hot for me
[5:44:26] hope_spl: lmao
[5:44:30] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Just because you bike everyday in -30C doesn't mean it isn't cold, it means you are used to what it feels like to be in the cold doing an activity.
[5:44:38] OneSmugFrog: wind and humidity plays a big part in temperature perception
[5:44:39] didistetter: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives TRUEING TRUEING
[5:44:41] hope_spl: empathy deficient smh!!!!
[5:44:54] Joker_GGEZ: -20c is not that cold no
[5:45:01] Januous: it’s crazy in the Midwest bro the summers get like 111 degrees and winters get -30
[5:45:02] didistetter: no ur not
[5:45:05] Joker_GGEZ: -35c is cold

[5:45:09] youareallsobeutyful: 5up im finnish
[5:45:13] 9fierce9: people are pulling your leg 5uå
[5:45:14] CoyoteTina: Anything under freezing is too cold
[5:45:16] Joker_GGEZ: mr "i love the cold"
[5:45:20] youareallsobeutyful: @Joker_GGEZ yes
[5:45:24] didistetter: anything under 20f is literally freezing chat is just flexing their northerness
[5:45:31] Januous: GIRL YOU CANT BE SERIOUS
[5:45:37] Halofan642: no way i just read a message saying -20c is not that cold no
[5:45:41] OneSmugFrog: I literally go out in a tshirt while snowing
[5:45:44] Joker_GGEZ: what is 30 f
[5:45:46] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: If water on your skin wants to turn into ice, then it is cold. I tolerate cold REALLY well, but that doesn't mean it isn't cold, it just means I like it.
[5:45:48] mypreppydiaries: favorite season?
[5:45:48] Halofan642: that cant be real
[5:45:54] Joker_GGEZ: @Halofan642 it is not naw

[5:45:56] youareallsobeutyful: - 20c is half the year in Finland
[5:45:58] didistetter: it is -1c yeah
[5:46:02] OneSmugFrog: -1 is SO NOT COLD
[5:46:04] Halofan642: 0c is freezing, 27 f is freezing
[5:46:06] Joker_GGEZ: wait you cant wear normal clothes in -1c????
[5:46:07] CoyoteTina: I'ma summer girl, I love my hot ass 90's weather
[5:46:08] ElevenWasTaken: I used to be that way when I was younger, now I admit it's goddamn cold and I want my jacket
[5:46:23] CoyoteTina: 32 F is freezing
[5:46:24] Halofan642: wait

[5:46:26] BluerBlack: !rank

[5:46:43] Halofan642: i mean iT IS 32F
[5:46:46] Alpha_Sakura: I live in Texas and if it gets lower than 40 f I am suffering
[5:46:51] didistetter: @Halofan642 om
[5:46:51] Halofan642: the 27 number MUST be important
[5:46:57] Januous: GUYS BELOW 0 IS FREEZING
[5:46:59] Joker_GGEZ: why do you guys use fahrenheit anyway
[5:47:00] CoyoteTina: acreKek
[5:47:00] Halofan642: HOLD ON LET ME THINK WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS 27
[5:47:02] Halofan642: I KNEW IT WAS 32
[5:47:03] Joker_GGEZ: be normal
[5:47:04] Halofan642: IM SERIOUS
[5:47:14] BluerBlack: Do you know how many accident there were because someone had to do conversion and failed
[5:47:17] didistetter: guys. the entire fucking point of farenheit. is 32 is the freezing point of water
[5:47:18] pureiinsanity: 42... hmm theres something about that number
[5:47:19] Joker_GGEZ: @Halofan642 there is nothing serious about fahrenheit
[5:47:19] Januous: IT GETS NEGATIVE 30 F HERE THATS COLDER THAN ANTARCTICA
[5:47:22] twtrok: hey, your fault to not use metric system in the first place
[5:47:26] Halofan642: KELVIN
[5:47:27] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: To be fair, 27F is freezing, it just isn't the freezing point of water.
[5:47:33] Airshredder: He isn't wrong, water does freeze at 27F, it will just do so at a faster rate than at 32F,
[5:47:35] Halofan642: 273 IS FREEZING
[5:47:35] youareallsobeutyful: @Joker_GGEZ real
[5:47:38] Alpha_Sakura: yknow I feel like
[5:47:38] zatyna_: full ad peepoSit
[5:47:41] Joker_GGEZ: WHO THE HELL MEASURES TEMPERATURE IN KELVIN
[5:47:46] Januous: WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT
[5:47:46] didistetter: so yes 32 is freezing. 15 is also freezing. -30 is the fucking artic
[5:47:47] Alpha_Sakura: they should’ve explained Fahrenheit and Celsius to us in school
[5:47:53] Alpha_Sakura: I don’t understand the difference at all
[5:47:55] Januous: KELVIN ISNT FUCKING REAL
[5:47:56] Halofan642: @Joker_GGEZ i just remember it from chem class
[5:47:59] Halofan642: that 273 was important
[5:48:03] Halofan642: so i think i just cut off the 3
[5:48:09] BluerBlack: @Joker_GGEZ people that need to calculate things?
[5:48:18] BluerBlack: Who even need F
[5:48:23] Joker_GGEZ: my brain is so broken
[5:48:26] Halofan642: ok that makes me feel better now
[5:48:30] BluerBlack: America still counts things with C
[5:48:31] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Halofan642 -273.25 kelvin is theoretical absolute 0 where molecules stop movement and the universe dies. It is not the freezing point of water.
[5:48:36] Alpha_Sakura: people who’ve never been taught Fahrenheit
[5:48:39] Alpha_Sakura: I mean celsius
[5:48:41] twtrok: we need to make fun of it
[5:48:42] MarioTrigo: yes we do
[5:48:43] 9fierce9: no we do need to make fun of F
[5:48:46] Joker_GGEZ: @Halofan642 you should not feel better for essentially dividing the number by 10
[5:48:46] Dav3Schneider: Yeah! Well I use Kelvin.
[5:48:48] Januous: HOW COLD DO YOU THINK COLD IS IN FARENHEIT
[5:48:50] Halofan642: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives look bro all i know is that 273 is important
[5:48:51] Alpha_Sakura: NotLikeThis
[5:48:58] MarioTrigo: american systems are a joke LMAO
[5:48:59] niightdancer: 5upBlank
[5:49:02] Joker_GGEZ: "i just think people are being elitist" followed by fahrenheit elitism
[5:49:03] OneSmugFrog: also Celsius is easy once you understand it lmao
[5:49:03] Alpha_Sakura: 273?????
[5:49:04] Halofan642: @Joker_GGEZ i should.
[5:49:11] Alpha_Sakura: WHERE DID 273 COME FROM
[5:49:14] Januous: LIKE YOU CANT GO OUTSIDE OR YOULL LIKE
[5:49:16] Januous: DIE
[5:49:18] youareallsobeutyful: cold is where F and C meet
[5:49:20] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Halofan642 True, -273 is important in theoretical situations.
[5:49:24] Januous: I DONT FUCKING KNOW
[5:49:27] zatyna_: kelvin is just superior
[5:49:28] Alpha_Sakura: Omg guys they know he’s 5up
[5:49:32] Komar95_: @Halofan642 bruh thats kelvin
[5:49:34] BluerBlack: You know that its not true, even with C its hard because feeling is also based on humidity
[5:49:38] lavfully: i'm leaving until we end this conversation 5upDes
[5:49:44] BluerBlack: Thats just US excuse
[5:49:44] Januous: YEAH MAN
[5:49:46] Halofan642: @Alpha_Sakura chem class ok i just remember 273 from kelvin for some reason and cut off the 3 at the end dont ask why
[5:49:49] Joker_GGEZ: what is 45 F
[5:49:58] Halofan642: i thought 27 f was freezng cause i confused the two ok just understand
[5:50:03] Hayase64: I don't understand F because I didn't grow up with it and that's okay
[5:50:07] Alpha_Sakura: oki
[5:50:10] aliciaravenscar: 7 in celsius
[5:50:10] zatyna_: @Joker_GGEZ 7 degrees
[5:50:12] Joker_GGEZ: ok youre just weak
[5:50:17] Januous: HOW
[5:50:18] FrozenLavaReflector: 45 F is 8 C
[5:50:20] MrGhosToaster: 7
[5:50:20] BluerBlack: Temp that you feel is also based on humidity
[5:50:22] BluerBlack: ...
[5:50:23] Januous: IM OPENING GOOGLE
[5:50:32] Joker_GGEZ: ok thats fair
[5:50:40] Halofan642: hes lived in arizona and la u guys have to realize its hot there
[5:50:48] wetsfeeb: chat is kinda cold weather snobs lol
[5:50:51] Kaiser_Emiya: For Celsius to Fahrenheit, (c)° times 3.33 to get it in Fahrenheit?
[5:50:54] Joker_GGEZ: @Halofan642 yeah but he was like "i love the cold"
[5:50:58] ElevenWasTaken: Cold also feels colder in the morning imo
[5:51:05] balletbunny: @wetsfeeb LOL
[5:51:13] Joker_GGEZ: you cannot say this to me
[5:51:13] CoyoteTina: Arizona was fun, except I had to replace my air mattress cause a scorpion poked a hole in it
[5:51:14] Januous: GUYS DO YOU THINK NEGATIVE 30 CELCIUS IS COLD
[5:51:16] Dav3Schneider: I get cold around 40ish but I also like the cold. I just bundle up more.
[5:51:16] Joker_GGEZ: you KNOW you cannot say this to me
[5:51:18] superfreak123: lol
[5:51:21] Joker_GGEZ: you know where ive lived
[5:51:22] BluerBlack: How cold it is there and how hot?
[5:51:25] Joker_GGEZ: and you know what i wear
[5:51:29] balletbunny: the cold weather gatekeepers
[5:51:40] firstprinceps: deserts are cold at night no?
[5:51:48] didistetter: -30 c is cold chat. smh not all of us can be from minnesota
[5:51:53] Halofan642: didnt u want to move to denmark at one point
[5:51:56] Halofan642: or were u juste learning danish for fun
[5:51:58] Joker_GGEZ: as someone whos experienced both tokyo summers and sub antarctic temp winters
[5:52:02] Joker_GGEZ: tokyo summers are better
[5:52:12] Joker_GGEZ: and i dont have to validate chat's weakness
[5:52:15] Joker_GGEZ: smh
[5:52:18] Primordii: lol
[5:52:27] MrGhosToaster: @firstprinceps depends, majority of places no but it does it cooler
[5:52:27] Halofan642: that nocturne needs to be studiest
[5:52:30] Halofan642: studied
[5:52:36] angelarson: 37C+ where i live im much more adjusted to heat
[5:52:37] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Halofan642 To be fair he didn't say "I like the freezing cold!" I mean, if you can literally describe a temperature as "freezing" and be accurate... probably shouldn't equate that to cold for nuance sake.
[5:52:46] coolwaveofcalm: I have lived in the desert where it was 120 F every day and I have lived in the cold Northeast. i have had both extremes
[5:52:48] youareallsobeutyful: im not saying i would be fine where you live but you say the cold isn't bad while never experienced what i consider cold
[5:52:53] Januous: ok is 48 celcious hot
[5:53:04] BluerBlack: YEP
[5:53:14] mypreppydiaries: ooop
[5:53:17] Januous: FUCK YOU I ALREADY HAVE
[5:53:19] didistetter: now add 87% humidity onto that and watch them squirm
[5:53:20] zatyna_: u just die no? om
[5:53:20] mypreppydiaries: I feel tried
[5:53:25] Cleophi: I hate it when it gets to almost 50
[5:53:28] Komar95_: no AC?
[5:53:30] FrozenLavaReflector: 48 is indeed hot
[5:53:30] pureiinsanity: 47 F? yep
[5:53:33] caffeineul: i can safely say i have survived 2 days of 47celcius
[5:53:35] coolwaveofcalm: I HAVE TOO
[5:53:38] balletbunny: melt
[5:53:40] firstprinceps: 47 Celsius is kinda crazy
[5:53:41] Joker_GGEZ: i could
[5:53:43] Joker_GGEZ: i literally could
[5:53:48] CoyoteTina: Been in a Texas summer where it got 125 F with 87 percent humidity. In full ACU with armour an kit on.. oof.
[5:53:48] coolwaveofcalm: @pureiinsanity celsius
[5:53:54] Joker_GGEZ: i literally have even
[5:53:56] BluerBlack: Survive 43C without AC and we can talk KEKW
[5:53:57] MrGhosToaster: if it gets to 47C you just go inside because its not worth it anymore
[5:54:04] didistetter: @CoyoteTina o_O
[5:54:11] youareallsobeutyful: highest temp ive experienced is like 110 F
[5:54:14] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Imagine weeks to months of 44-49C.... heat sucks.
[5:54:15] aliciaravenscar: I live in a tropical country. We get upto 49 each year. It is indeed terrible.
[5:54:15] Cleophi: for like months I come home drenched in sweat because the weather will not go below 40
[5:54:16] FrozenLavaReflector: I know i couldnt
[5:54:23] caffeineul: @MrGhosToaster can confirm, we were told to stay in our dorms that day lmao
[5:54:25] MrGhosToaster: without AC if its humid your just dead
[5:54:31] angelarson: cant believe theres like temperature elitists of all things
[5:54:33] Hayase64: It's  already 7°C where I live and in the past it would go in the negative
[5:54:34] keisevit: i have survided numerous 40c days, 47c seems livable too
[5:54:34] CoyoteTina: @didistetter I may have drank like 6 3 liter camel backs full of water that day...
[5:54:38] Joker_GGEZ: i just take three showers a day in that weather
[5:54:40] Joker_GGEZ: but i mean its fine
[5:54:52] Joker_GGEZ: like i still prefer that insane heat to this insane cold
[5:55:00] Januous: DUDE. it got to high 40s in celcius one summer. the air conditioning BROKE. my sister and grandma? went to a fucking STADIUM for hours. only reason i stayed inside? i was watching YOUR FUCKING STREAM
[5:55:16] pureiinsanity: FR just wear wet clothes
[5:55:21] Halofan642: @Joker_GGEZ why prefer heat? you can always put more layers on but u cant take layers off
[5:55:22] FrozenLavaReflector: But where i live weather patterns simply dont exist
[5:55:23] CoyoteTina: kitdyKEK
[5:55:27] mypreppydiaries: living in the uk, you just get used to insane cold weather conditions.
[5:55:46] Joker_GGEZ: @Halofan642 feels nicer
[5:55:50] Joker_GGEZ: like i get the logic of it
[5:55:53] Joker_GGEZ: logically it's correct
[5:55:56] Joker_GGEZ: but heat is just nicer
[5:56:16] Joker_GGEZ: it's also really fun to just nap in grass in the heat
[5:56:48] Halofan642: its 8 mins if hes not level 6 hes trolling
[5:56:49] BluerBlack: @Halofan642 I bet he is like Shrek and have layers that can take off Kappa
[5:56:53] Halofan642: i guess it was 730
[5:57:01] balletbunny: EntireShrekMovie
[5:57:16] Januous: ok guys where’s somewhere you’d never live in your life ever
[5:57:25] Joker_GGEZ: light heat >>>> light cold > extreme heat > extreme cold
[5:57:28] Joker_GGEZ: @Januous florida
[5:57:42] Januous: based
[5:57:42] Joker_GGEZ: because it's florida
[5:57:51] Halofan642: @Januous syria
[5:57:52] Januous: Florida fucking SUCKS
[5:57:54] BluerBlack: northerrn Sweeden or Canada
[5:57:55] youareallsobeutyful: @Joker_GGEZ yes
[5:58:08] BluerBlack: no sun or like 2h of sun daily
[5:58:20] Joker_GGEZ: @BluerBlack as someone who lives in canada: based
[5:58:40] Halofan642: maybe he has scaling health
[5:58:49] Halofan642: YOONE MISSED EVERYTHING MAN
[5:59:20] Joker_GGEZ: i always feel so vindicated when chatters agree w me
[5:59:29] Halofan642: ya yone has scaling health
[5:59:36] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ Random question to you have extremely good or extremely poor hand eye coordination or somatosensory perception(knowledge of where you body is in space around you without sight of it)?
[6:00:38] Joker_GGEZ: what
[6:00:44] Joker_GGEZ: 5upCry
[6:00:56] Joker_GGEZ: oh wait i see
[6:01:00] Halofan642: "what" LMFAOOO
[6:01:11] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I said it was a random question for a reason.
[6:01:20] Joker_GGEZ: uhhh my hand eye coordination is good, i dont think ive been in a situation where i can answer the second one
[6:01:37] Joker_GGEZ: or rather ive never thought about it
[6:02:10] Joker_GGEZ: im interpreting the second question like "if youre blindfolded can you tell where you are" fwiw but idk if thats what youre asking
[6:02:51] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Just curious, the way you describe temperature is similar to someone who has under or overdeveloped doral root ganglions in the spinal cord, which also tend to result in extremely poor or extremely good reflexes, proprioception etc.
[6:02:57] Joker_GGEZ: @Halofan642 i felt so BAD lmao but my brain was short circuiting again
[6:03:24] Joker_GGEZ: dude set that all up to call me a biological anomaly
[6:03:34] Joker_GGEZ: im stealing that
[6:04:00] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ "If you were blindfolded could you touch a specific part of your body to another part easily. Like left pinky to right middle finger or index finger to tip of your ear etc.
[6:04:00] Joker_GGEZ: idk if ill use it, but im stealing that
[6:04:10] Joker_GGEZ: oh
[6:04:10] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[6:04:11] Halofan642: i need him to analyze me man
[6:04:13] Joker_GGEZ: yes 100%
[6:04:25] Joker_GGEZ: wait can people not do that
[6:04:29] Joker_GGEZ: i thought that was just normal
[6:04:33] Halofan642: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives cant most people do that?
[6:04:36] Halofan642: HSHHAHAHA JOKER
[6:04:42] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[6:04:42] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Less well than you think.
[6:04:54] Joker_GGEZ: oh wild
[6:05:11] Gragnoth: lucian went straight melee! XD
[6:05:13] didistetter: 5up7
[6:05:13] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Humans are sight based mammals, you take away sight and you would be shocked how out of balance and awareness the average person is.
[6:05:26] Joker_GGEZ: ugh i GUESS ill do it just for you
[6:05:31] Gragnoth: oh I'll stick around! :3 but I gotta make my dad a birthday cake! ^.^
[6:05:31] Januous: i love deception games
[6:05:31] Joker_GGEZ: since you asked nicely.
[6:05:36] Halofan642: oh if i close my eyes i start walking diagonally
[6:05:39] Joker_GGEZ: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives that's fair yea
[6:05:40] auraizen: prefer deception games over league tbh i only watch league when its you
[6:05:46] CoyoteTina: I'ma be lurking how ever long I can. Got mod duties up so I'ma keep a tab open for ya
[6:05:49] Joker_GGEZ: @Halofan642 ????????
[6:05:51] Halofan642: like not pure diagonal but i dont walk straight
[6:05:52] FrozenLavaReflector: When is the dsponsores stream?
[6:05:52] Januous: the only instance where you can lie to, gaslight, and manipulate your friends with it being legal
[6:06:01] SorayaSayo: @auraizen agreed
[6:06:01] Joker_GGEZ: oh ok fair lol
[6:06:04] Joker_GGEZ: i can still walk straight
[6:06:12] Halofan642: yeah lmao
[6:06:20] Halofan642: i think it mnight have to do with back or feet or something tho idk
[6:06:27] Joker_GGEZ: i thought you just meant that like
[6:06:34] Joker_GGEZ: your controls swap direction
[6:06:46] Joker_GGEZ: for lack of a better way to describe it
[6:06:48] pandamiranda420: when are you changing games?
[6:06:52] Halofan642: no i realize saying i walk diagonal wasnt the best way of putting it
[6:06:55] MrGhosToaster: @Januous where do you live that lying is illegal
[6:07:00] Halofan642: more like crooked
[6:07:09] Joker_GGEZ: icicic
[6:07:19] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Halofan642 If you have good proprioception, but still walk at an angle with your eyes closed, that is usually a balance issue, often caused by poor posture. Modern chiropractors focus on fixing stuff like that a lot because tilting of the spinal cord during posture can lead to foraminal narrowing and potential stenosis.
[6:07:25] Joker_GGEZ: i got told by my boxing instructor that i have weird hands once
[6:07:32] Joker_GGEZ: that's something i'm taking to my grave
[6:07:41] Joker_GGEZ: @NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives bro halo you just got called OUTTTT LMAO
[6:07:47] epifiza: I thought you became a dragon main
[6:07:48] balletbunny: i think the sponsor is at 2pm pst
[6:07:55] epifiza: How come you're playing humans now
[6:08:01] Halofan642: ya posture
[6:08:04] Halofan642: that sounds right
[6:08:13] epifiza: If you were truly loyal you would've taken asol anyways
[6:08:25] Gragnoth: gotta play shyv then! or j4! ;P
[6:08:31] FrozenLavaReflector: Yone does indees farm asol, ican confirm
[6:08:34] epifiza: A certified 5up moment
[6:08:38] Halofan642: @Joker_GGEZ no hes right i think
[6:08:40] Gragnoth: I know j4 isn't a dragon... but didn't he get in a realtionship with shyv?
[6:08:58] Joker_GGEZ: nospoons have you done research into like visualization and stuff
[6:09:05] Joker_GGEZ: im assuming youre a researcher atp anyway
[6:09:14] epifiza: Genuine question, how does it feel to stream league. Ik you were a chall player before amogus, but idk if you streamed it before amogus
[6:09:17] Joker_GGEZ: do you know why some people cant visualize in color and/or dimension and others can
[6:09:21] FrozenLavaReflector: Yasuo is leagues better in terms of design than yone imi
[6:09:27] FrozenLavaReflector: Imo
[6:09:37] VVIZRRD: That could've been a team fight but your team opted for individual 1v4s.
[6:09:55] youareallsobeutyful: aatrox played that like he was qiyana
[6:09:58] FrozenLavaReflector: Yasuo feels fair to fight
[6:10:21] FrozenLavaReflector: Yone can miss everytging and still win, its bullshit incarnate
[6:10:21] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector LUL
[6:10:26] Joker_GGEZ: 5up does it still help out if i leave stream on during the sponsored segment im realizing i have errands i have to do today
[6:10:32] VVIZRRD: Yasuo feels fair to fight *compared to Yone.
[6:10:54] Halofan642: they made yone so yasuo players could have a champ to play when it was banned (it was banned a LOT)
[6:11:08] pureiinsanity: i have Yasuo more than Yone and its not even close solely because of that W ability
[6:11:11] pureiinsanity: hate*
[6:11:14] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ I do not, but that's because as far as I've found we as humans don't know for sure. It is thought to be a combination of how developed and interconnected your occipital lobe is to the hippocampus and potentially amydala.
[6:11:31] Joker_GGEZ: ahhh okok
[6:12:03] coolwaveofcalm: LMAO
[6:12:10] jeskieKAT: peepoPopcorn
[6:12:12] pureiinsanity: yasuo W shouldn't exist in the state that its in
[6:12:13] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ There have been interesting correlation drawn between the emotional content someone takes in from what they see- movies etc.- and their ability to see things in color or 3D in their head.
[6:12:23] BluerBlack: I have left eye dominant and im right handed, its fun trying to shoot anything
[6:12:34] BluerBlack: Humans are sometimes fun
[6:12:39] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ Correlation does not imply or prove causation however so it's all just theories at this point.
[6:12:53] VVIZRRD: @pureiinsanity It's just a stationary Braum shield. Which is *totally* something that's fine for a high-damage brawler like Yasuo to have. =P
[6:14:19] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ Lots of interesting theories and stuff we have found out, but no concrete answers which is what I think you were hoping for.
[6:14:32] whimzyplays: just in time to see the 1v9 king in action
[6:14:35] pureiinsanity: you can literally have infinite damage but the moment Yasuo presses that W ability your whole champions seizes to be
[6:14:41] whimzyplays: playing gray screen simulatorrrrr
[6:15:06] whimzyplays: hello streamer, hello chat!~~
[6:15:06] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: 5UP isn't dead, he was just playing league in Noir mode for a minute.
[6:15:15] pureiinsanity: Yone does not do that so i prefer facing him
[6:15:19] whimzyplays: lmao
[6:15:40] didistetter: jamm
[6:15:44] BluerBlack: Chat, remember never ask what happened to 4up...
[6:16:03] cyberlapse: he just pressed r
[6:16:21] pureiinsanity: @BluerBlack isint 4up his father?
[6:16:52] whimzyplays: @pureiinsanity you're not supposed to ask!
[6:16:58] FrozenLavaReflector: @pureiinsanity counterpoint,yasuo windwall can be played around, yone cant
[6:17:41] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector yeah just get into melee range of yasuo only for him to E past you so your on the opposite side of the windwall again NotLikeThis LUL
[6:17:46] pureiinsanity: so much counterplay
[6:18:02] FrozenLavaReflector: Yone is a champion that has some od the lowest counterplay in tge gamw, and at high level, that counterplay bwcomwa nonwxistwnt
[6:18:55] pureiinsanity: Yasuo can block a lot of CC abilities with that dumb wall, that would CUCK yone
[6:19:11] pureiinsanity: still think Yasuo is way worse
[6:19:18] VVIZRRD: @pureiinsanity Double wind wall? We talking URF here?
[6:19:20] FrozenLavaReflector: You can crwod control a yasuo, you cant cc a yone
[6:19:42] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector thats factually not correct
[6:19:54] pureiinsanity: more CC's work on Yone than yasuo
[6:20:23] FrozenLavaReflector: @pureiinsanity uns5rtoppablwr in multiplw abilities says otherwise
[6:20:51] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector yasuo also has those
[6:20:57] FrozenLavaReflector: L
[6:21:07] didistetter: big rip
[6:21:07] FrozenLavaReflector: In what abilities?
[6:21:22] BluerBlack: !rank
[6:21:22] didistetter: peepoCheer emerald here we come peepoCheer
[6:21:23] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond I 14 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[6:21:29] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector R, W, Q

[6:21:33] BluerBlack: one more
[6:21:36] BluerBlack: and diamond 2
[6:21:45] diamond1iscalling: you’re here to stay :)
[6:21:51] OneSmugFrog: negative acceleration eh
[6:22:21] FrozenLavaReflector: Non of those are unstopables outside of maybe r, which locks him in place
[6:22:23] VVIZRRD: Yasuo R is bad if other champs get knock-up for him. His own knock-up is easy to dodge if you're not already CC'd.
[6:22:38] Januous: YEAH MAN GET THAT BREAD
[6:22:52] BriarSoul: BriarSoul subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[6:22:55] niightdancer: 5upPrime

[6:23:10] BluerBlack: I can make you play something fun if you want that badly? Kappa
[6:23:11] FrozenLavaReflector: And yasuo has to use his abilities well to win,yone doesnt
[6:23:28] Dav3Schneider: yorick mid
[6:23:45] Dav3Schneider: thats the point lol
[6:23:53] VVIZRRD: Jungle Shen.
[6:23:57] Dav3Schneider: my prime is up on the 18th or I would make you do it
[6:24:20] BluerBlack: 2 in 1 deal I guess
[6:24:21] Alpha_Sakura: :00
[6:24:30] BluerBlack: 30 for graves and then chat chooses
[6:24:42] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector i wouldn't be nearly as mad at yasuo if it was not for his W
[6:25:04] pureiinsanity: i think that ability is the most BS in the whole game
[6:25:26] pureiinsanity: yeah
[6:25:37] youareallsobeutyful: @pureiinsanity renata w?
[6:25:38] pureiinsanity: nonono
[6:25:41] pureiinsanity: not even close
[6:25:46] pureiinsanity: yasuo W is way worse
[6:25:55] VVIZRRD: @pureiinsanity Yasuo W requires both sides standing still to be as busted as you think it is.
[6:26:04] FrozenLavaReflector: Yone e is worse than yasuo w
[6:26:05] youareallsobeutyful: @pureiinsanity you're not sane
[6:26:09] BluerBlack: yummi? Pog
[6:26:17] FrozenLavaReflector: Illaoi e exists
[6:26:29] youareallsobeutyful: carry yuumi
[6:26:40] XortedI: a lil renata gamington?
[6:26:44] pureiinsanity: you guys are all high yasuo W is most insane ability in league
[6:26:49] FrozenLavaReflector: Fiora w is much worse as well
[6:27:11] BluerBlack: You have high yuumi wr rate
[6:27:12] FrozenLavaReflector: Pure, you might be tge one wrong him
[6:27:19] pureiinsanity: the fact you HAVE to play around it tho
[6:27:23] JustaStoopidDog: i feel like samiras wind wall is worse
[6:27:27] VVIZRRD: Wind Wall is also so easy to bait out and has a long cooldown.
[6:27:29] JustaStoopidDog: because 360
[6:27:30] pureiinsanity: but
[6:27:32] pureiinsanity: you 4 seconds
[6:27:34] pureiinsanity: its duration
[6:27:36] pureiinsanity: is NOT ok
[6:27:41] XortedI: yay
[6:27:48] pureiinsanity: 4 seconds is too long
[6:27:48] FrozenLavaReflector: Thats every champion in yhe game pure
[6:27:48] VVIZRRD: @pureiinsanity This entire game is playing around your opponents. That's literally the game.
[6:27:50] JustaStoopidDog: just walk forward
[6:27:54] pureiinsanity: for that powerful of an effect
[6:27:55] youareallsobeutyful: @pureiinsanity that's every champ in game man
[6:28:15] FrozenLavaReflector: You have to play around every champ
[6:28:34] Dav3Schneider: They definitely swapped, right?
[6:28:39] FrozenLavaReflector: Samira windwall is honestly worse than yasuo windwall
[6:28:45] pureiinsanity: it completely invalidates a lot of champions when he presses it
[6:28:46] Dav3Schneider: No shot you don't run lucian/nami
[6:29:00] FrozenLavaReflector: No it doesnt
[6:29:02] pureiinsanity: @FrozenLavaReflector Samira lasts for 0.75 seconds
[6:29:03] VVIZRRD: Braum's shield stays on him and has like half the cooldown of Windwall, totally busted right?
[6:29:08] pureiinsanity: 4seconds > 0.75
[6:29:10] youareallsobeutyful: @pureiinsanity jax e
[6:29:15] Dav3Schneider: You can kinda juke around yasuo W, samira is just like, "Hey that skillshot you sent is just gone. gl."

[6:30:19] FrozenLavaReflector: Yasuo w is a great ability, but therez like 17 others id rather have s
[6:30:29] BluerBlack: wtf
[6:30:33] Tirmel: This train of champions really kind of looks like a k-pop group
[6:30:36] lil__soupy: what?
[6:31:11] pureiinsanity: @youareallsobeutyful Veigar E is also pretty dumb but not as dumb as Windwall

[6:35:33] pureiinsanity: to ignite
[6:35:58] FrozenLavaReflector: Akali shroud invalidates more champions than windwall, and lasts longer
[6:36:13] ewwii_damncat: noo it is good
[6:36:17] BluerBlack: old akali
[6:36:20] BluerBlack: was so fun
[6:36:23] pureiinsanity: its not because it doesn't stop allies getting hit
[6:36:31] pureiinsanity: windwall is still worse

[6:39:36] Neonar_: Her passive as well
[6:40:07] pureiinsanity: AP Renata will actually kill you faster than Vayne
[6:40:27] VVIZRRD: @Neonar_ Ah yes, the OG Kraken Slayer.
[6:40:28] pureiinsanity: as long as her passive is procced

[6:58:57] Kaiser_Emiya: Who the stingray looking guy?

[7:24:30] cameron416: @town_owl what trade
[7:25:42] town_owl: hitting alistar 3 times gave 34 gold each. didnt know they buffed support gold generation that hard
[7:26:14] sharffffff: Do you think it's possible to play league as a one-trick pony? I think a thing I'm scared most of is just the insane amount of stuff to learn and focusing on one champ would be significantly easier
[7:26:49] sharffffff: Okay good it's just you that's insane
[7:26:54] Joker_GGEZ: what do they do when their champ gets banned
[7:27:06] Prox_02: 2nd pick or dodge
[7:27:07] sharffffff: @Joker_GGEZ cry, i guess
[7:27:13] Joker_GGEZ: Oh ❤️
[7:27:16] cameron416: more like 3-trick pony for safety and some variability
[7:27:23] pureiinsanity: @sharffffff you can take it easy even if you play different champs dont really matter as long as you have fun
[7:27:23] town_owl: especially when learning just play one champ one role. then start playing similar champs would be my recc
[7:28:13] pureiinsanity: even playing different champions so you figure out what you like is good
[7:28:29] cameron416: for example my mid picks rn are mostly taliyah, vex, or diana
[7:29:42] Joker_GGEZ: bad advice

[7:30:02] pureiinsanity: @Joker_GGEZ which
