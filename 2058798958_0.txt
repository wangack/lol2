[0:44:26] ameliatrox: people go out on saturdays no
[0:44:29] draco_silence: I hear Alois and other top players say he’s got the highest skill gap to learn how to play properly, like he’s technically the hardest top lane champ to play. @naayil what would you say?
[0:44:42] chrono_ward: Dead game xd
[0:44:43] Orbit_JiWoo: Dead game
[0:44:44] kajyto1550: yeah but as a riven and gp player i think that riven can fuck up a ton more than gp
[0:44:45] cheerios20203: Garen teaches good fundamentals LOL
[0:44:48] Ogolikus1982: garen teaches fundamentals because he literally can only run at people
[0:44:58] enesi_peci: Hello naayil u look fresh
[0:44:58] two_cubes: I was asking 4 that bc im in gold and main gnar and im learning GP
[0:45:01] jamesmckill: how close to challenger?
[0:45:16] Tak0Salvaje: Master Yi teaches you fundamentals because you are forced to right click an enemy
[0:45:25] Komlin111: lane management I meant
[0:45:25] cheerios20203: I can't for the life of me play gp
[0:45:32] cheerios20203: I screw up with him every game i play
[0:45:33] martelo_e_soco: Irelia hard tbh
[0:45:42] PlasmicQuantum: is he hard to play or hard to master?
[0:45:43] draco_silence: In your opinion @naayil what makes him so difficult?
[0:45:49] dew_ry: irelia is easy but hard to master
[0:45:55] Orbit_JiWoo: Once u master the barrel thing its fk
[0:46:00] jester86: garen is for sure №0, hardest champ
[0:46:01] Tak0Salvaje: If you want to learn lane management, then isn't Darius the best option?
[0:46:06] Niklaus097: @Naayil do you changing runes or are they the same all the time?
[0:46:08] GodLastWarrior01: riven is snowball champ it takes from her
[0:46:26] Ramiesel: best champion to learn how to do taxes?
[0:46:29] cheerios20203: @Naayil So would you say if a player masters gp would it be easier to mechanically master other champions if you master a champ like gp?
[0:46:41] kilwazol2: @Ramiesel aatrox
[0:46:43] Bnadryl: Show backround
[0:46:50] chrono_ward: To be fair lane management doesn't even matter till like d1 masters imo

[0:47:24] Naoya_Shortstack_Enjoyer: xdd
[0:47:24] Tak0Salvaje: Because if you need to learn lane management that means you are in low elo, and why would you pick something diffcult in low elo?

[0:48:28] two_cubes: Re u ill?
[0:48:30] cheerios20203: @two_cubes anything related to learning the game will be better with simple champs because then you will truly be able to learn the fundamentals
[0:48:37] Ramiesel: mmr

[3:31:09] cheerios20203: you have to buy defensive items too late
[3:31:14] cheerios20203: 4th-5th item
[3:31:16] noxzius999: i mean if you went with ravenous it would also heal
[3:31:40] nywden: it's basically duskblade dmg but without the invulnerable passive
[3:31:41] cheerios20203: ravenous would be pointless

[3:32:20] cheerios20203: maybe even only olaf
[3:32:30] lucky_oneee: This build can't 1v9, looks like dogshit
[3:32:30] xionpoe: best ks item xdd
[3:32:33] banatoo: yo there is an item called frozen mallet it seems goo
[3:32:34] Raepyphany: riven barely uses that item

[3:33:48] Komlin111: hydra cant have omnivamp cus of hecarim
[3:33:53] cheerios20203: the others are just pointless
[3:33:55] cheerios20203: and even last season
[3:34:01] cheerios20203: aatrox didn't use raveonus at all
[3:34:04] Naoya_Shortstack_Enjoyer: God I fucking love Thresh

[3:36:14] cheerios20203: @noxzius999 yeah on some drafts you can but i mean as a darius main you must know that the item is still bad compared to what it was
[3:36:15] xionpoe: sundered also bugged on rengar and briar, riot doesn't fix

[3:40:15] noxzius999: just good to clear with and autos deal maybe bit more dmg
[3:40:30] cheerios20203: maybe people miss the old lethality aatrox with drakhtarr
[3:40:33] xnxshadowxnxx: is it a problem if i buy shojin first and then sky
[3:40:36] Dia_X9: i'm just comparing i've seen it on other aatrox mains ig it has its pros and cons
[3:40:48] zayrox0x: bro are u going to gym
[3:40:54] cuchooo: what's the main reason you dont like hydra edge and serylda?
[3:41:03] Tongks: @Naayil how do you think they'll nerf sundered sky?
[3:41:04] ponyrosa_: that item was nerfed i think
[3:41:08] cheerios20203: serylda new passive is very bad
[3:41:28] trudgenIX: im eating watermelon and u show me some rotten brain shit? bro
[3:41:30] khlori: Riot when mages dick THAT
[3:41:48] weqdeathmark: thoughts on eclipse ?

[3:42:05] alterneefe: why does pros like it so much
[3:42:13] meeresmannn: is serylda bad on every champ or just aatrox
[3:42:15] cheerios20203: koreans build it for waveclear i swear
[3:42:17] In_Thee_Flesh: @alterneefe because it has seen progress last season
[3:42:22] noxzius999: @alterneefe cuz they fight 24/7 right?
[3:42:24] ameliatrox: what are u watching
[3:42:24] Zaaashi: do you know kim mijae 김민재 aatrox player?

[3:42:36] SuddenHuevos: bruiser aatrox feels amazing
[3:42:38] JerryPlayzGames: @alterneefe because they can play around aatrox more effiecient
[3:42:39] khlori: @meeresmannn Maybe Naafiri, maybe, too bad she overnerfed
[3:42:39] trudgenIX: thx man @noxzius999
[3:42:39] xxauriel: Yorick sometimes does
[3:42:43] In_Thee_Flesh: jayce builds it
[3:42:57] noxzius999: serylda might be decent if you can shred their hp to less 50% rq
[3:42:59] danypose10: Looks like they delete the mythics for bulding anything but i feel that u can build like 2 forms only
[3:43:04] ameliatrox: why are we watching biology?
[3:43:07] danypose10: Like that work
[3:43:08] cheerios20203: because pro's play with constant communication with their team and they are incredibly organized
[3:43:09] cuchooo: maybe it's just not part of your playstyle
[3:43:13] xionpoe: its just one game tho and you  mix it with too much bruiser items, full lethality aatrox with eclipse actually good and dealts 5 times the bruiser build
[3:43:15] KeshaBR: spearshot is cooked
[3:43:21] cheerios20203: building lethality in a soloq game is really dumb

[3:44:52] danypose10: I think the good thing on blac cleaver is that the effects works on the teammates too

[5:06:23] therockcena99: His point wasn’t that he shouldn’t go to failure but that it isn’t completely essential to do it
[5:06:29] DireZach: if you go to failure frequently, its a lot more likely to get injured. what youre describing is near-failure not total failure
