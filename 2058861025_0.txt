[4:04:16] bossthelevel: Hear me out Lord of the rings is a trilogy that includes a dragon named smog, who lives on a mountain and breathes fire. On the other hand, cows make milk to make butter, horses exist there too because you ride horses, cats are there to take care of the pests. @shiphtur

[4:07:50] bossthelevel: I. Mad for you
[4:08:02] bossthelevel: Solo que things
[4:08:23] bossthelevel: Which like there's this old saying, this game is really only fun if you're playing on a proteam, or playing with friends
[4:08:40] FrndlyDragon: at least vex got us Gladge
[4:09:13] dewidewidewi: the bot incident Despairge
[4:09:18] FrndlyDragon: ono

[4:09:36] bossthelevel: Still lose
[4:09:36] FrndlyDragon: shits op
[4:09:40] DogDamnn: i like getting tiamat on everything
[4:09:51] tezballin19: i tried this game for the first time with my emerald rank friend and got absoulety destroyed and farmed idk how to play this game bro
[4:10:24] floqrover: honestly, league has big learning curve
[4:10:46] bossthelevel: @tezballin19 don't start. There is an Eldritch meme, pobelter says this everyday, "I should become a variety streamer, but I've invested so much time into this game spaghetti code, I don't even want to try to be good at other games"
[4:10:47] aerychan: tezballin19 you'll get the hang of it. Your friend was higher rank than you so the games bound to be very difficult if you just started.
[4:11:11] combowombowombo: emerald is way too high rank for someone who just started
[4:11:29] bossthelevel: @tezballin19 honest recommendation? Try dark n darker
[4:11:32] bossthelevel: Fun af
[4:11:44] FrndlyDragon: YEP
[4:11:52] FrndlyDragon: at least with a friend, it'll be easier
[4:11:56] Tacocrazy08: yea league is so bad for new players
[4:12:05] floqrover: yes 100%
[4:12:16] superjedijesus: Just like a pusher would
[4:12:17] lilacleafeon: yes i’m teaching 3 of my friends to play it
[4:12:25] Mar_Quon: watching streams taught me
[4:12:27] xJorgeitor: !jman
[4:12:27] Nightbot: shipOKO 7 BY MY WILL shipOKO 7 TODAY IS A GOOD DAY shipOKO 7 TO DIE shipOKO 7 FOR MY FATHER shipOKO 7 THE KING shipOKO 7
[4:12:30] BroccoliYumYum: Then how did the very first players learn? Thinkge
[4:12:44] bossthelevel: Very true, my first main was old tarek. My friends convinced me to swap from dota, I also understood this and knew that I absolutely knew nothing. So I was just trying to look for a support champion that heals and stuns, because I at least knew that core concept of an OP champion.
[4:12:44] Vilekon: way less champions and abilities back then
[4:12:45] tezballin19: i played darius and was getting like 4 shot top
[4:12:46] combowombowombo: @BroccoliYumYum theory crafting and thousands of games
[4:12:47] FrndlyDragon: @BroccoliYumYum the very first players were ass xdd
[4:12:59] bossthelevel: Then taric gets a rework, and he's OP af
[4:13:05] Shmba: dota 1 was out before league
[4:13:22] FrndlyDragon: there's also that, yeah. Prior moba game knowledge.
[4:13:26] bossthelevel: @shmba I am a huge warcraft 3 custom mode enjoyer
[4:13:39] VictorMolotov: smite at the start
[4:13:48] VictorMolotov: and smite again
[4:13:48] combowombowombo: back then the "meta" was like backing on a cannon minion
[4:13:52] combowombowombo: like that was a pro thing to do
[4:13:54] combowombowombo: LOL
[4:14:18] bossthelevel: Also, league? Kind of waters down the idea of rts. Ever watch competitive starcraft? It's 1v1. This is a team game, so a lot of people start mobas with previous RTS knowledge, and then end up being huge flamers like tyler1
[4:14:20] aerychan: @combowombowombo before people really knew good wave management LuL

[4:15:04] FrndlyDragon: is there a world where Jarvan goes tiamat first to get grubs faster? Hmmge
[4:15:15] Noidas: BACK IN LEAGUE?
[4:15:27] FrndlyDragon: xdd
[4:15:45] FadeEffect: in the preview video they said that is recommended to kill the grubs all at once

[4:15:46] LoLRankBot: shiphtur is Diamond I 58 LP
[4:15:47] Nightbot: @ektetulling, Shiphtur's Valorant rank is Immortal 1 - 61RR.
[4:16:05] ektetulling: why no duo with the king qt?
[4:16:05] bossthelevel: @frndlydragon best first grub tactic? Ask support to deep ward his side 1 mins before grub spawn. Gives you vision of enenmy Jung.
[4:16:17] quietblue: FirstTimeChatter
[4:16:25] dewidewidewi: sniffthenewchatter
[4:16:35] bossthelevel: Kill grubs all at once is a dream, but always contested.
[4:16:55] bossthelevel: There's always the but a link ward, one grub at-a-time tech
[4:17:09] bossthelevel: Buy a link ward*
[4:17:43] bossthelevel: You have the map pressure to be able to steal jungle camps, snowball! @shiphtur

[4:27:56] bossthelevel: You tried
[4:28:14] bossthelevel: Exactly
[4:28:18] Snaizzz: J4 is strong in this meta
[4:28:33] bossthelevel: And you spend more time ganking people who don't know how to use their lead that you just gave them, versus oh crap I wish I had more gold but I spent time ganking versus farming
[4:28:47] bossthelevel: Feels
[4:28:48] Snaizzz: but he still the same as before
[4:29:01] Snaizzz: no amount of fed will help u 1v5
[4:29:19] Snaizzz: unless enemy team just idiot
[4:30:27] Balls_Bigg: why is the ping like that
[4:30:33] johnadam131994: Type it

[4:33:55] bossthelevel: @shiphtur league is truly fun with friends, or on a team.
[4:34:01] bossthelevel: Solo que is wild cardz
[4:34:19] TxYouE: its a lot of miscommunications w/o voice
[4:34:31] bossthelevel: That creates that trick2g mentally
[4:34:39] bossthelevel: Which, is not team oriented
[4:34:47] FadeEffect: actually I think now in order to ping for vision you have to use the ping wheel tthingy
[4:34:55] FadeEffect: which nobody uses lmao
[4:34:56] lilacleafeon: sett?
[4:34:59] bossthelevel: "I'ma feed too lane and gatez"
[4:35:13] aerychan: @lilacleafeon i think so too
[4:35:21] miniWD40: yi?

[4:35:34] miniWD40: oh jk part vastayan
[4:35:47] suormas: sett

[4:36:03] miniWD40: yeah probs sett
[4:36:03] FrndlyDragon: half vastayan from ionia
[4:36:05] miniWD40: cuz also manaless
[4:36:12] bossthelevel: @fadeeffect there's actually a hidden technique with the ping wheel, if you want your team to start grubs you don't ping the grubs, you just random ping under it while the enemy jungler is near it. Tricks the team into thinking, "hey the jungler trying to do grubs" vrs the jungler sees both mid and top rotate, he thinks "oh fuck, top and mid tryna grub
[4:36:23] quietblue: Chatting
