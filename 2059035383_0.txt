[2:53:53] Pitju99: why not darkseal from remaining 350?
[2:54:36] Endoskeleton: lololol
[2:54:36] Shukketsuu: because teemo is vulnerable to death
[2:55:07] Pitju99: yeah but still ap
[2:56:03] alikalee: what do those fire things do
[2:56:15] Shukketsuu: they give move speed for a second
[2:59:02] apple_country: and they give you some ability haste too once you get enough (i think)
[3:03:12] Shukketsuu: relatable
[3:03:43] EG_Kel: jhin be like Applecatrun
[3:06:51] EG_Kel: PepegaGun samira ing
[3:07:07] 514484: "should of" BrokeBack
[3:07:26] lokken_tak: what does should of even mean
[3:07:29] lokken_tak: why do zoomers say it
[3:07:39] alikalee: pretty sure the rapid fire cannon is giving him the extra range on you when he yellow cards ... thats why he gets to throw it first
[3:08:00] 514484: illiterate native speakers who write phonetically
[3:08:10] 514484: many such cases
[3:08:37] EG_Kel: @514484 yup really hate when people say then instead of than
[3:09:27] CurtPlatinum: look at dis grammer polize chat foamin at d mouth
[3:09:40] lokken_tak: i legit dont understand it
[3:09:46] lokken_tak: eng is my 3rd language
[3:09:48] KotVMeshke: @514484 Thanks for pointing this) As not native speaker I was wondering about this)
[3:09:58] 514484: lokken_tak "should'veé becomes "should of"
[3:10:15] lokken_tak: but why
[3:10:39] 514484: illiteracy
[3:11:10] rekdy: When you pronounce should've it kinda sounds like should of
[3:11:11] Shukketsuu: teemo icon :)
[3:11:15] EG_Kel: @CurtPlatinum grammer police this PlantsGrab
[3:11:37] 514484: RabbitArrive
[3:11:41] CurtPlatinum: it isn't illiteracy its the pronounciation within a specific dialect
[3:11:47] canonic: should've is actually should have.  people just say it wrong and say should of
[3:11:58] apple_country: @lokken_tak "should've" is the correct way of writing the word, but some people are bad at spelling and just write it how the word sounds, and it becomes "should of"
[3:12:38] 514484: shoodev
[3:13:23] Shukketsuu: samira did it and they started talking about it
[3:13:40] 514484: it's triggering
[3:13:45] EG_Kel: get him boyz ahYes

[3:15:52] Koolrider13: Good evening shu
[3:16:31] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: i think its risky to run conditioning against such a threat
[3:16:53] SmittyWerbenJagerManJnsen: cause Aatrox can run u down when he gets 6 before conditioning pops off
[3:17:36] xLeSeigneurBalekx: what is on hit ? bork>guinso> jaksho> terminus ?
[3:17:59] 514484: something like this yes

[3:22:05] EG_Kel: ipav should buy the hide on bush name
[3:22:35] 514484: blinding the yellow card only works at max range
[3:22:55] 514484: looks like this hasn changed with the last """buff"""
