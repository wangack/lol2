[0:12:46] browy_eu: yooo early stream today?
[0:13:16] flsh55: @Elevate00 I stopped maining Phel cuz adc sucks ass
[0:13:22] chipichipichapachapagr: I'm at the point where everytime I play ADC other lanes feed and everytime I play mid bot feeds
[0:13:38] flsh55: and I love the him sm, but I cant get back to him cuz bot always makes me wanna go away
[0:13:57] skitter_bb: r.i.p.
[0:14:09] flsh55: @chipichipichapachapagr maybe I just suck but I feel like not a single supp uses their 1 shared braincell
[0:14:31] Elevate00: @flsh55 aphelios is a fun champ, just requires so much setup from teammates its insane, and when you have teamates with headphone dents for brains, it can be hard to actually get anything done
[0:14:37] flsh55: like picking Naut into double poke lane that we cant engage on obviously
[0:14:41] Elevate00: All that to say... I feel ya homie peepoHug
[0:15:06] chipichipichapachapagr: Yeah and I hate when supps roam the map throwing your own lane
[0:15:13] skitter_bb: Aphel is fun on ARAM and just build all the Lethality/put points into that first so with Axiom Arc you can spam ult
[0:15:24] CictorGabriel: D:

[0:15:50] skitter_bb: since the start Dubatt I'm sure
[0:15:55] flsh55: @Elevate00 I love champs with unique stuff and he is my fav in that way, but its just unplayable without a premade
[0:15:58] Dubatt0: altho im playing a modpack thats hella hard
[0:16:01] Dubatt0: so ig thats why
[0:16:01] skitter_bb: Food Poison/Hunger doesn't kill, Poison Poison always killed
[0:16:09] chipichipichapachapagr: Idiots everywhere I swear
