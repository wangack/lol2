[1:07:01] CompulsiveOne: EZ
[1:07:02] DoubleGambit13: land by far
[1:07:03] Swiftfool: Land
[1:07:04] Dozyderp: 100 percent religion
[1:07:04] GebisGaming: land
[1:07:06] Devious_gastropod: What was the question
[1:07:07] mattband: land bro
[1:07:07] Miskav: Dudes just being really insecure
[1:07:08] 3eetle: territory without a doubt
[1:07:10] Oglino: land? tink
[1:07:11] Fynagle: Territory IS land.
[1:07:14] That_Hollow: Hot  Pockets
[1:07:14] SnailsOnAChalkboard: land or territory?
[1:07:23] Doctor_Richie: 3rd one is Bitches
[1:07:26] Oglino: land probably goes back longer right
[1:07:26] TheGrayPlains: resourses might have been 3rd
[1:07:27] Doctor_Richie: Land Religion or Bitches
[1:07:29] RobbedGamer: Resources?
[1:07:33] furioso77: nothing more than religion. anyone saying otherwise is not right
[1:07:36] zaleves: idk, often times these ideas mix together when actual "war" is had
[1:07:38] kingsableye: How are we defining "more wars"? Because the biggest war was fought over religion
[1:07:42] 3eetle: think every nomadic/pastoral people for all of history competing over resources and it outweights religion for sure
[1:07:45] PyroOptional: territory, religion. or some hot lady
[1:07:50] SnailsOnAChalkboard: land, religion, or greed?
[1:07:53] Fynagle: The problem is religion can be used alongside land and resources.
[1:08:11] Swiftfool: I mean most religious wars were for land
[1:08:14] PoorMansPoison: Plenty of violence has been religiously motivated but I think Land is the motivator for more wars
[1:08:31] furioso77: if you say land. what was the basis for the war? most likely religion
[1:08:33] CompulsiveOne: like most of the medieval times wars were religion based so Shruge
[1:08:44] Fynagle: Land and resources are the main motivator but religion makes it sound more appealing.,
[1:08:49] Percussion1: nothing like being viktor from arcane and doing a fuckton of damage
[1:08:51] PoorMansPoison: ^
[1:08:51] 3eetle: @CompulsiveOne maybe european/near eastern sure
[1:08:56] osakey: What about religious land? fairKEK
[1:09:06] Swiftfool: The purpose is always land, religion is how you convince people to die for you.
[1:09:13] kingsableye: It's crazy how split the Chat is lawlmanLUL
[1:09:19] RobbedGamer: True are the Crusades a religious or land war if the aim was to "take back the holy land"
[1:09:41] mattband: it is.
[1:09:48] 3eetle: i think people are thinking 1500's and later instead of all of human history
[1:09:49] Devious_gastropod: the reason the people who command the war is for land, the reason the regular joe fights is religion
[1:10:07] bandit0424: if by land we mean expansion then theres the whole category of civil wars
[1:10:21] Oglino: OMEGALUL DEJA VU

[1:10:22] PoorMansPoison: this song and dance is Hilarious
[1:10:24] jackfruitswordsman: I guess it also depends on if we are talking about the true purpose of the war, vs. what it is advertised as.
[1:10:26] Kirmle: the regular joe is just as much fighting for loot as well
[1:10:37] MyGamingInGeneral: hes gonna be mad at mid

[1:11:01] PoorMansPoison: viktor fucking gaming
[1:11:04] NameThatIsAMeme: Land and glory were big factors for the nobility involved, but mainly those involved with the crusades went on them to gain favor with the pope, the strongest political figure in medieval Europe
[1:11:05] ToutedDjinn: zeus hiii

[1:11:45] Doctor_Richie: wait is this a cover?
[1:11:55] elec_ink: State and religion were separated only recently so destroying religious rivals was the same as conquering a land
[1:11:59] MyGamingInGeneral: @kingsableye never!
[1:12:05] Miskav: @kingsableye That's like every gold league janna buying Mejai's crumpKek
[1:12:12] RobbedGamer: Love the phrase "baby cage"
[1:12:22] Percussion1: 2 items and boots at 15, this guy is juicing
[1:12:32] Swiftfool: I mean did Gengis Khan war over religion or land?
[1:12:37] RobbedGamer: I've heard it referred to as "baby jail"
[1:12:41] CompulsiveOne: this guy is almost chovying NOWAY
[1:13:03] Dozyderp: @Swiftfool judging by how many people are now descended from him, i'd say it was for booty
[1:13:29] Swiftfool: @Dozyderp im one of his descendents lol
[1:13:40] RobbedGamer: Statistically most of us are
[1:13:41] Doctor_Richie: I think the Khans went to war because they could win

[1:14:22] Miskav: That's gonna be good for their viegar's mental
[1:14:37] jackfruitswordsman: Yeah I feel like a lot of early wars were likely more religion based (at least advertised), and then as we got to modernity a larger percentage is land based.
[1:14:38] elec_ink: i think Gengis conquest was more of a personal quest for glory thing
[1:15:03] Doctor_Richie: he is running it down mid lmao

[1:23:16] jackfruitswordsman: @jackfruitswordsman True true a lot of ancient Asian wars were based around land. Then it becomes a mixture with like Britain creating a focus on resources, and areas like India introducing some religious wars with its' neighbors, and internally.
[1:23:20] PoorMansPoison: A widdle chip off the ol wock peepoHappy

[1:24:54] zaleves: Another area of war I know nothing about is the Americas before colonization. No idea what war was about for those groups
[1:25:35] razzelcat: @zaleves hunting grounds, slaves, food maybe
[1:25:54] MyGamingInGeneral: 0-0
[1:25:59] zaleves: Seems pretty evenly split tbh
[1:26:03] razzelcat: so resources
[1:26:07] jackfruitswordsman: I mean for ancient Americas it would also heavily depend on the tribes and which ones we are looking at.
[1:26:08] Miskav: Mongols ego-wars, asia territory wars, europe resource wars, rest religion wars
[1:26:08] RobbedGamer: Your philosophers are still debating sire.
[1:26:20] Salty_Platypus: wars can be both though
[1:26:21] bitterspring: war never changes
[1:26:26] NameThatIsAMeme: 100% more wars of territory using religion as a smokescreen
[1:26:31] AFatFrog: @zaleves conquest/conquest/slavery/etc.
[1:26:32] MyGamingInGeneral: @RobbedGamer goldmanLUL
[1:26:32] DoubleGambit13: It's almost all for territory or resources, which are in specific territories
[1:27:08] Salty_Platypus: often religion is used to legitimize territorrial ambitions
[1:27:12] bitterspring: what about the emu war chat?
[1:27:14] Rejnols: what tournament is being played?
[1:27:18] jackfruitswordsman: Cause like with the Americas there would be some that are focused on conquest and becoming stronger, but others would be more based around broken alliances and lands/resources being invaded.
[1:27:24] zaleves: I do think its a false dilemma though. Feel like territory and religion are often entwined reasons
[1:27:42] krispycreed: i just got out of my urf

[5:23:22] burnyourflash: its gg
[5:23:26] Oglino: gg
[5:23:27] Rejnols: Smolder is perfect for solo queue. Because either you go 0/5 but game drags out to 30 minutes because macro is dogshit, or the game is over in 15 minutes and you can queue up into the next one
[5:23:35] GebisGaming: it's never been more joever

[5:24:28] CompulsiveOne: i stopped in season 6
[5:24:34] Rejnols: "Xerath staying at 0 mana, better full push"
