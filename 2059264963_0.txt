[5:45:39] fusionnaveen1337: Top 5 I'd say would be Blitz/Malphite/Alistar/Swain/Cho'Gath
[5:45:41] hi_im_soapy: Learning
[5:45:47] DarthAchilles: But I don't like the number 3 and my brain loves the number 5
[5:45:50] TheOneShorter: does sej ult feel as good as i imagine

[5:46:16] blarggy: sylas is still a disgusting animal though so
[5:46:17] Paeshhy: Gnar ult had a crazy AP ratio
[5:46:18] Lazynameross: when sylas steals asol ult can he get the big one if it was stacked up at the time? or its always basic one
[5:46:25] neilanblowmii: hecarim

I have a really important question for you, as you can guess I play midlane, I'm silver and decreasing because my team always throws the game and the surrender quickly. Can you recommend me some champs that can carry easy in silver to get to Gold. I'm main Asol but I notice they nerfed him after that huge buff. What do you recommend? I naturally play ap but I accept ap and ad if I need to climb, at this point and don't really care.
