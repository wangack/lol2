[0:24:49] WEENIEHUT__GENERAL: @KolerMaister he doesnt take ignite on all matchups
[0:24:54] Nightbot: try not to let him stack fury he gets fury by autoing minions so just slow push vs him, kite around pillar when he ults if possible
[0:25:10] yukinobestgirl: So  I q and I auto or, how do I do both at the same time? Seems like this is an advanced cancel mechanic
[0:25:16] KolerMaister: @WEENIEHUT__GENERAL to most he does

[3:42:14] populouswildman: catJAM
[3:42:14] hartzenx: what does Lucian mean with wc
[3:42:19] redseal16: thought so
[3:42:25] resin_fb: cam for this game to give us the whole experience
[3:42:32] resin_fb: k thx lar
[3:42:33] TrundleTop1: there were two that were also gm but decayed cause school
[3:42:37] populouswildman: chill music for saturday night catJAM
[3:42:44] TrundleTop1: lemme find
[3:42:50] Deddy__: @Deddy__ yeah I trust you but still imo he's an amazing player, it happens to play really bad one game or to giga tilt, but if overall he can reach top 300 he's still absurd
[3:42:54] redseal16: you also had that one where you play olaf to like 700ish lp
[3:42:55] twiekr: wc = wave clear
[3:42:56] redseal16: last season
[3:43:00] resin_fb: sue the school for account decay!
[3:43:01] hartzenx: ty
[3:43:06] populouswildman: !irelia
[3:43:06] Nightbot: dont allow her to cs EVER stay on top of minion that shes going to q on and just auto q auto her. When she presses e but does the thing where she doesnt recast until the end FIGHT HER during this time, but the second she recasts you need stop ur auto and dodge it
[3:43:34] Suki077: !nasus
[3:43:34] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists
[3:43:36] Deddy__: like, there are some games where Tyler1 literally plays like a gold player but he's one of the few people to reach chall on 5 roles at least once, but even reaching chall on your main role is still absurd

[3:51:24] Deddy__: hey guys maybe they just walked in that exact bush for a pure coincidence
[3:51:34] Deddy__: all 5 of them
[3:52:04] CIeanBoy: does he have commands on how to counter everybody with trundle?
[3:52:14] redseal16: pretty much
[3:52:27] pertinax81: !shen
[3:52:27] MiistWasHere: @Deddy__ suuurely
[3:52:27] Nightbot: can cancel his ult with pillar if he suddenly starts moving backwards and u see ur team fighting he will probably ult so stop him. He is strong early be careful. You cant push the wave vs him early just let him push it. DONT q HIS W ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.
[3:52:35] Zeiroth: !akshan
[3:52:35] Nightbot: when he E's just stay right next to him parallel with whatever wall hes eing onto and it will cancel it because he will bump into you because when he E‚Äôs he extends slightly outwards
[3:53:03] shoksim: !jax
[3:53:03] Nightbot: when he es just run with w, ult his ult. DONT q HIS E ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.

[3:53:32] Zeiroth: !fiora
[3:53:33] Nightbot: try not to chomp her parry, stay near wall when she ults so she cant get last vital. Not sure if you win level one cause they can just kite. Make sure u do not ult her w extremely important it negates the entire spell everything. DONT q HER W ITS NOT GOOD TRUST.
[3:53:43] Deddy__: I would like to play trundle but I dont have traditional trundle, can I use another one?
[3:54:09] CoragemMcz: !mordekaiser
[3:54:09] Nightbot: just pillar him when he ults and kite around it DO NOT fight him in the ult, if you guys are alone right before the ult is about to end ult him and you will destroy him. If you think hes going to ult wait to use your w because it wont come to the death realm if casted in normal realm

[3:59:13] resin_fb: I guess, but just wanted to see if it was possible and it‚Äôs not. lol it will auto select one to die and the other two get shielded
[3:59:55] warwicksupport: I'll be honest the fact I have a roommate, I play a free play game, and that should show I'm not smart or rich lol
[3:59:58] NotASkiller: When people get a green sword next to their name they act like cops who draw their gun on unarmed civilians

[4:04:22] Deddy__: XDD ADC MAINS
[4:04:22] redseal16: tfblade although he didnt get rank 1 he got rank 3 with a non riot account in kr
[4:04:37] Deddy__: Aphelios blaming trundle for 1 kill thanks to ghosting a stream
[4:04:38] Haviokamus: BabyRage aphelios
[4:04:43] donoldtrump69: This aphelios needs to get shot

[4:05:29] kaiserwroth: trundle should always go for the head when he chomps
[4:05:31] Zeiroth: @warwicksupport I play urgot rarely also, hes really a champ you need to stay in practice with to be good on, but hes strong
[4:05:33] redseal16: unless you buy the tiamat part later
[4:05:40] bredmania: First Aph blames Akali, now he blames you. He really should start looking at his own gameplay xDDDD
[4:06:18] Edrees502: well you giving him free stacks SeriousSloth
[4:06:25] Renofox: does this streamer ever talk, or silent streamer?
[4:06:32] warwicksupport: Mr zerioth that's an intesting point! Who are good Champs for players who don't play regimented
[4:06:38] Deddy__: sell dorans to buy bork not worth?
[4:06:47] Deddy__: damn i would insta do that
[4:06:52] NotASkiller: He probably focuses better when he's not using mic
[4:07:06] mayhead: @Renofox had mic + cam earlier
[4:07:08] ColonelPanic5150: Dorans items were buffed, so that's prob why
[4:07:19] ColonelPanic5150: Just guessing
[4:07:22] warwicksupport: @renofox when I watxh Mr trundle top he's always silent but is like the man in between games answering questions

[4:08:12] CakeAndVainilla: !Nasus
[4:08:12] Nightbot: ult after he ults and dont fight in his e it reduces your armor. If he ults just run pillar him if u can save ult  save it unless u die otherwise then when its about to expire (check the timer on him by looking at his buffs) ult him and he will have extremely low resists
[4:08:26] Zeiroth: @warwicksupport Garen, Jax, Yi, Volibear, Mundo are all pretty easy to play as first time if you dont know how to play them
[4:08:30] Deddy__: yeah he's kinda absurd to how many questions he answers with 1k viewers, usually above 300 viewers it's really hard to get a question answered in other streams
[4:08:39] AIRKILLER: @zoocapa1789 mundo? no
