[0:31:45] DevilishRose: do people cheat in tft? is that possible?
[0:32:04] Arkencet: @devilishrose does it matter? vanguard will purge all of them
[0:32:20] Glitter_Gunner36: peepoArrive HYPERS
[0:32:45] DevilishRose: I mean, I use moba, but even with that, I suck lol
[0:33:19] DevilishRose: mobalytics
[0:35:03] DevilishRose: it does
[0:35:06] DevilishRose: and is
[0:35:29] Francois_Fapperino: boxbox is cheating then
[0:35:35] Arkencet: wings, do you consider jungle timers cheating?
[0:36:09] DevilishRose: it tells you what are the good comps, it can also build off of your current team in tft
[0:36:10] ettore932: it gives team comps and best item options i think
[0:36:12] AiErain: the camp timers
[0:36:29] thikona: i liked when you dident get timers because you had to pay atention to it and if you had no idea when dragon spawn you couldent contest it at all
[0:36:35] Nightbot: @Francois_Fapperino -> Let's rock! [stop posting links] [warning]
[0:37:07] Francois_Fapperino: tbh all high level tft players look up stats on tactics. tools
[0:37:11] Rps_i_legiit: it doesnt give enemy respawn timers unless you did them or had vision i think
[0:37:11] rakuny34: rakuny34 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[0:37:30] Arkencet: only when u have vision the timer will show
[0:37:33] Pibalu: But the apps only give timers of camps you cleared
[0:38:35] worldwar5: seems good
[0:40:01] DevilishRose: tbf, I dont use it for those purposes xD
[0:40:02] SmokeeTheBandit: no it doesnt do that
[0:40:02] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[0:40:06] Rps_i_legiit: no it doesnt do that you have to have vision of it being cleared
[0:40:14] its_tastes_like_purple: can you add IHaveAQuestion emote after this?
[0:40:46] SmokeeTheBandit: even if they take your own red buff without you seeing it get taken you dont get a timer
[0:40:51] Rps_i_legiit: I would say only a small percentage of the player base use it anyway
[0:41:01] The_Jester141: I've never used any of thise 3rd party apps. I feel like is just wierd for me
[0:41:23] worldwar5: wow is more pve then pvp
[0:41:56] aiteros: Even in pve you need a bunch of addons and weak auras in wow
[0:42:13] Arkencet: what do you think about vanguard coming next patch?

[0:43:57] captain_scuffedbeard: if feels so wierd needing addons to play a game properly
[0:44:26] PatchMyEye: @captain_scuffedbeard its been that way for decades though but yea
[0:44:29] IHateLifeSoMuch213: I use a third party program that gives me vision of all enemy players at all time in the game and I do not consider it cheating this is information that everyone should have the  right to

[0:45:18] AiErain: there a magic cloak for neko on ur bench
[0:45:31] smashdakeys: You really don't need addons for wow. People more need them  for a crutch. The only addon you really benefit from is some form of addon tracker like  gladius.
[0:45:33] captain_scuffedbeard: wow is what i was talking about, completely agree with you. am a casual wow player and like it clean
[0:45:40] RaggaXBomb: i like weak auras

[0:51:37] krieger8772: Ist this last round?
[0:51:41] Ironicusx: dont take day offs LFire
[0:51:58] krieger8772: Also thats 10 penta
[0:52:27] thikona: geting thesona 2 would be nice
[0:53:42] ccarlangas: kennen
[0:55:37] vader_da_slayer: +lp so still a good game
[0:55:43] DouugIas: good game tho
[0:56:09] carbonstylus: lol you saw riotphroxzon twitter post about losers q not existing?
[0:56:10] Ironicusx: 10 penta too stronk nothing beats that
[0:56:19] worldwar5: just belive in your self
[0:56:19] grunnlid_: golden 3 stars KKona
[0:56:20] krieger8772: 10 kda
[0:56:35] overdoszed: prob some 3 star 5 cost
[0:56:35] Vita51: prolly 9 true damage
[0:56:46] Ironicusx: so i guess elo hell doesnt exist aswell
[0:57:12] carbonstylus: that post reads like something riotlyte would type KEKW
[0:57:35] KdanDranzer: No one was saying it was intentional, more that this is a consequence of matchmaking being terrible enough that loser queue exists
[0:58:02] RaggaXBomb: theres also 4 other players with hundreds of things they could have done
[0:58:09] Arkencet: the game tests you if you deserve to climb
[0:58:13] KdanDranzer: Bobby in gold just shouldn't be playing with Timmy in Silver IV and Jack in Bronze 1
[0:58:17] KdanDranzer: But that happenes
[0:58:22] LightPulse21: Did he make the algorithm that makes the matchups? Even if he did does he understand how it works?
[0:58:42] TheSaltyShakerLoL: detective mode
[0:58:52] Arkencet: i 100% agree with phroxzon here
[0:59:05] TheSaltyShakerLoL: SmoocherZ
[0:59:15] Ironicusx: he sys this is a 5v5 team game but claims that a single person can carry every single match?
[0:59:17] Ironicusx: SURE!
[0:59:24] KdanDranzer: I think the troll that feeds 6-10 kills then AFKs had more an impact than any other player though
[0:59:28] leonxu123: HUH
[0:59:39] Platinumm1: lol
[1:00:02] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[1:00:05] Platinumm1: truueeee
[1:00:13] TheSaltyShakerLoL: thats why only tf climbs on new accnts
[1:00:30] KdanDranzer: An actual Rioter did not just use a Reddit front page as proof
[1:01:16] RaggaXBomb: is this what they mean by toxic positivity?
[1:01:35] TheSaltyShakerLoL: lol
[1:01:35] KdanDranzer: More like just ignorance of the nature of the problem and why people are upset
[1:01:44] freefromdepression: LUL
[1:01:50] thikona: try
[1:01:52] WhiteSabre: do it
[1:01:57] TheSaltyShakerLoL: THE BUG
[1:02:14] vader_da_slayer: I think he just being a cringe programmer with the debug comment
[1:02:28] LightPulse21: Riot just believes they are gods that can do no wrong at this point tbh
[1:02:30] worldwar5: yeh thats my reason too
[1:02:33] Vita51: just sounds like a programmer joke yeah
[1:02:39] worldwar5: fukcin other players
[1:02:42] meth_junk1e: if you are michael jordan
[1:02:43] Glitter_Gunner36: having a "good mental" isn't gonna do jack shit if you have shitters in your game
[1:02:58] TheSaltyShakerLoL: i think hes being serious
[1:03:15] meth_junk1e: shutdown gold
[1:03:18] moodymaddy: U r not faker u dont deserve to have fun playing league of legends Kappa Kappa SeemsGood
[1:03:19] WhiteSabre: Silver 2 Coaching
[1:03:22] WhiteSabre: Kappa
[1:03:38] ehRoman: I'd like my mates to play MORE conservatively with their leads instead of ALWAYS giving their shutdowns in 1v3
[1:03:41] KdanDranzer: @Glitter_Gunner36 I think a big problem is Phroxzon thinks this should be the approach to every game rather than "Huh, 7/10 games are lost by my teammates being notably terrible"
[1:03:44] ehRoman: wtf is he saying
[1:03:44] Arkencet: that’s actually a very good point
[1:03:46] RaggaXBomb: i know my silver 2 jungler is watching the map
[1:03:51] ehRoman: i'm witnessing the opposite
[1:03:52] KdanDranzer: "Maybe the issue is the matchmaking"
[1:03:57] meth_junk1e: 95%
[1:04:04] XxbkgamerxX: Hey my favorite music is trending
[1:04:09] nemesea66: Tell that to the 4 people diving my tower at lvl 4 lol
[1:04:15] Arkencet: @meth_junk1e where did he even get that number from
[1:04:19] Fudgenator: so you aren’t the teammate running it down LUL
[1:04:23] KdanDranzer: You could play a game where you die the least and that doesn't help when your teammate(s) are going double digits deaths apiece
[1:04:37] LightPulse21: What is so funny  is that a god complex like riot employees have of thus developer mentality is that in art form we've seen it in the past so many times architecture had it in the 1940s in modernism era
[1:04:40] thikona: that is just deflecting the problem if you avoid all ganks and every team mate gets caught in every gank you will still lose
[1:04:45] WhiteSabre: @nemesea66 Easy. Just stay in fountain Kappa
[1:04:47] KdanDranzer: ^
[1:04:51] RaggaXBomb: this twitter post feels gaslighting
[1:04:59] ehRoman: I just had a game of Karma mid where I was not dying and was doing crazy, but I couldnt stop the enemy team killing my mates. In loser queue even if you dont die you lose
[1:05:02] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[1:05:03] worldwar5: in german we have a word for that
[1:05:11] Ultrapako: yeah its pure bullshit reading this
[1:05:39] ehRoman: I was hitting a 20/3 unkillable Garen, there was no skill expression
[1:05:43] Ultrapako: didnt even get the point its not people being pissed of a loss, which obviously can happen
[1:05:46] KdanDranzer: A big counter point to "Players play too conservatively with a lead" is that throws absolutely happen in Solo Queue
[1:05:58] worldwar5: Verfolgungswahn
[1:06:04] KdanDranzer: You can win 90% of the game and then lose off the last 10% of a match because you made one bad call late game
[1:06:06] XenoRox65: This is a simple concept
[1:06:07] Ultrapako: its literally how it doenst matter if u have any impact at all
[1:06:25] PatchMyEye: yea problem is the game is 5v5 and in losers queue it feels like you are 1v9 every game. you should not have to do that, no matter how good or bad you are at the game or what rank you are
[1:06:26] Galkaria: i mean first and foremost riot has to take care of smurf accounts, nothing regarding MMR will matter when you can spend 5 bucks for a fresh level 30 emerald account
[1:06:38] freefromdepression: :\
[1:06:48] freefromdepression: yessir
[1:06:57] PunHok: damn what a great coach "if you played like faker you wouldve won" lol
[1:07:10] Misencoded: It's like no... how about rank me up game , and then let me struggle against players that are as good if not better than me. Instead of using me to boost bad players
[1:07:12] krieger8772: In short they are saying dedicated your life to lol or you are trash wich is bullshit
[1:07:20] feetofdeath: Is he talking about people that strive to become pros?cause if thats the case okay
[1:07:41] Ironicusx: he says this is a 5v5 team game but claims that a single person can carry every single match. FailFish
[1:07:42] PatchMyEye: agree
[1:07:58] copajoe: True
[1:07:59] PatchMyEye: its just not fun literally not getting to play
[1:08:05] its_tastes_like_purple: wintrading
[1:08:06] LightPulse21: Maaan the fact that 1500 employees got lay off and his sorry ass didn't feels like ass especially cause his salary could probably pay 10 to 20 other employees
[1:08:10] PatchMyEye: game is over before you get a chance to play
[1:09:01] AiErain: Jigsaw <3
[1:09:04] Glitter_Gunner36: KEKWlaugh
[1:09:10] Fudgenator: also a big reason games can feel like shit is people start flaming at any slight inconvenience to themselves or the smallest misplay
[1:09:12] hellenkellers: LULW
[1:09:18] KdanDranzer: @feetofdeath We wish. This is apparently Phroxzon's advice to all Ranked players
[1:09:19] CLGasm: Jigsaw
[1:09:22] Ironicusx: KEKW
[1:09:30] Zexard: monkaW saw
[1:09:34] RaggaXBomb: lmaooooo
[1:09:42] nemesea66: What if I dont want to improve? I just want to play some fun games to relax. But then you get smashed 4 times in a row. No fun at all
[1:09:44] prettycoldout: mogtimeREROLL mogtimeREROLL
[1:09:51] XxbkgamerxX: guess i die then
[1:09:55] AiErain: Now i wanna go play DBD and play pig 2020Rivalry
[1:09:59] Psylife1: now that is some real motivation
[1:09:59] Galkaria: doesn't that mean the players you play with can be redeemed? i thought players were brain dead monsters that don't know how to breathe
[1:10:02] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[1:10:04] Zexard: CLIMB OR DIE MAKE YOUR CHOICE
[1:10:33] WheresTheBaby: @Zexard i will die everytime XD
[1:10:58] anoobistuu11: The saw analogy is especially fitting because while you climb that 1k you slowly kill off your mentality on the way.
[1:11:20] Vita51: all of this applies to those teammates too though so i don't see the point
[1:11:30] worldwar5: live is hard
[1:12:40] Munnemun: Hallo!! i am ready to learn o7 i heard you are a good coach and main support so i am sad to see you play top :(
[1:12:43] its_tastes_like_purple: do you know how many variables are there to have a fair game?
[1:12:58] its_tastes_like_purple: can you add IHaveAQuestion?
[1:12:59] Galkaria: i've been teamkilled hundreds of times in ranked Siege, for as little as not reinforcing a specific wall to picking a specific character. climbing in general is dumb unless -every- person has the same goal
[1:13:14] Ironicusx: KEKW 󠀀
[1:13:22] Zexard: FirstTimeChatter moment
[1:13:25] feetofdeath: @its_tastes_like_purple should nt elo suffice?
[1:13:26] Munnemun: i am wrong?
[1:13:29] thikona: is that some wierd new copy pasta
[1:13:31] carbonstylus: Hallo!! i am ready to learn o7 i heard you are a good coach and main support so i am sad to see you play top :(
[1:13:39] Vita51: problem is a ton of people think they're performing well and they actually aren't then complain to riot about this, that's probably who the rioters post is meant for
[1:13:46] Galkaria: you can literally get team killed, yes
[1:13:58] its_tastes_like_purple: id play league with friendly fire BigBrother
[1:14:31] Vita51: id wager most aren't
[1:14:52] copajoe: We got a smolder
[1:14:53] Munnemun: @Wingsofdeath i am sry if i am wrong.. but someone told me you was support
[1:14:56] Vita51: but they think they are
[1:15:02] LightPulse21: Riot whatever his name was wants to pretend that they do not have people that made an algorithm that ensures you play  more losers queue are the perfect games to make avarage Joe tilt play

[1:15:21] Galkaria: probably a Geranimo watcher LUL
[1:15:22] its_tastes_like_purple: spreading miss information
[1:15:24] Munnemun: fuck him...
[1:15:26] AiErain: Wings isa  great panth support main Kappa
[1:15:42] Ironicusx: is that like a holigan loli?
[1:15:43] RaggaXBomb: in alot of my games i dont even play with people in my rank
[1:15:45] Ironicusx: loligan?

[1:46:51] Shinnyshin: Cashing in on whales is fine. Warping the game to cash in on whales is where it goes wrong.

[6:20:49] DragonyCH: oh god it's gwungle
[6:20:53] Francois_Fapperino: HUHH
[6:21:41] cyberlapse: the end is near
[6:21:43] rheaaaaaaaaa: is there a ETA for vanguard?
[6:21:50] Euravel: smoulder post 225 stacks is kinda gross
[6:22:07] DragonyCH: thinking about dual boot two windows instances
[6:22:10] rheaaaaaaaaa: i cant believe they are still going ahead with it despite everyone shitting on it
[6:22:13] DragonyCH: but that just sounds like a pain in the ass
[6:22:15] bioniclebob: Fiora time Pog
[6:22:20] rheaaaaaaaaa: @DragonyCH it works on dual boot also cause it's in kernel
[6:22:41] morses21: morses21 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[6:23:02] DragonyCH: @rheaaaaaaaaa i'd be very surprised if it can "install" on two seperate windows installations
[6:23:13] allesSternenstaub: really prefer that instead of a shitty laptop/pc lol only setup? with deinstall method, u have it 6 hours 5 days active on your personal pc
[6:23:14] DragonyCH: at that point it's just malware
[6:23:20] Psylife1: 2 pcs meta kekw
[6:23:20] Junodude: just have a 2nd bad pc for league
[6:23:23] rheaaaaaaaaa: it's considered a literal malware wdym
[6:23:27] CyclonicOceanNA: CyclonicOceanNA converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[6:23:30] rheaaaaaaaaa: that's why people are up in arms
[6:23:46] Francois_Fapperino: @rheaaaaaaaaa just install on diff hdd
[6:24:19] DragonyCH: just install league on mac. they have an expection and don't need to install vanguard
[6:24:28] DragonyCH: which kinda defeats the point imo
[6:24:35] rheaaaaaaaaa: im pretty sure it installs through the bios or something to get through people trying to dual boot and stuff
[6:24:43] rheaaaaaaaaa: riot is dogshit
[6:24:49] bad_drag: jayce can do that
[6:24:57] DragonyCH: pretty sure that's not how it works ^^

[6:25:04] Francois_Fapperino: @rheaaaaaaaaa it wont work like that the process still needs to be installed on the drive
[6:25:18] Euravel: nasus?
[6:25:23] allesSternenstaub: @rheaaaaaaaaa but what if u have 2 physical seperate hdd's?
[6:25:35] MadSpectre47: Or Gwen is coming
[6:25:54] DragonyCH: It installs itself as part of the operating system. It doesn't matter how many HDDs you have
[6:26:33] allesSternenstaub: yeah but i mean if you have 2 OS on two differend hdd
[6:26:50] allesSternenstaub: then switch os
[6:26:50] DragonyCH: Unless you mean having two HDDs for two seperate windows instances. Then yes, it would only be installed on one.
[6:26:55] allesSternenstaub: after playing
[6:27:05] TheOnionMaster: then u don't have lol on the other one. so you mean...you want to install an OS to play league?
[6:27:08] itszat0ichi: lane is frozen too, he must be mad
[6:27:32] Red_Fr0st_: just play league on MAC, they re not implementing vanguard there AppaK
[6:27:50] friendlycrackdealer: you can partition your hdd to hold two os's
[6:27:59] DragonyCH: If you dual boot, and only play league on one, vanguard shouldn't affect the other windows installation. But like wings said, it's a pain in the butt
[6:28:03] friendlycrackdealer: no separate computer or more hdd's needed.
[6:28:07] allesSternenstaub: play older lol streams as "live" Kappa
[6:28:08] TheOnionMaster: why would I want that just to play league?
[6:29:10] majesticcchim: does ksante's tell you it pulls you in?
[6:29:18] Francois_Fapperino: @DragonyCH i mean, once its set up its not a pain in the butt, you literally just need to choose the drive you want to boot from when you turn the pc on
[6:29:18] rekerlol: Vel koz does the same i think
[6:29:18] fancypegasus715: ori ult

[6:30:27] cyberlapse: milion dashes
[6:30:36] DragonyCH: @Francois_Fapperino yeah, but let's say you're chilling and then one of your buddies asks if you wanna play league. Then you're like "ok, 1 sec gotta reboot" and then you've gotta reboot, select the right instance, wait for windows, boot up discord, etc
[6:30:55] Ugisa: are you not a fan of tp or is there another reason you're not playing it?
[6:30:58] friendlycrackdealer: if you have a fast computer, it doesn't matter @DragonyCH
[6:31:14] allesSternenstaub: like yuumi players complaining about annoying teemo shrooms
[6:31:52] allesSternenstaub: @DragonyCH boot is seconds nowadays
[6:32:04] friendlycrackdealer: The great thing is that there's a lot of different options out there, some more affordable than others of course but at least options exist.  Just depends on you.
[6:32:47] rekerlol: Yuumi players complain about afk timers
[6:32:52] friendlycrackdealer: If you don't want to go through all the trouble of getting another setup going, then the best option is just to quit league all together.  yknow.
[6:33:06] Francois_Fapperino: yuumi players complain they have to be half awake to play
[6:33:16] Francois_Fapperino: they would rather sleep
[6:33:21] DragonyCH: @rekerlol Got LP loss reduced once, because a yuumi player didn't press any buttons for 3 minutes. Fastest surrender of my life
[6:33:52] TheOnionMaster: @Wingsofdeath they are talking about installing 2 separate OS's to play leaue on one and do anything else on the other
[6:33:53] Junodude: you can time his release with a doran cock ring
[6:33:56] friendlycrackdealer: talking about league and vanguard. KEKW
[6:34:01] allesSternenstaub: vanguard workaround options

[6:37:23] Kudosa: Do you like yone?
[6:37:33] DIETTWEAK: so why does riot need a new anticheat after 15 years
