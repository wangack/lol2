[0:37:01] Apostolique: You didn't find him fun?
[0:37:02] adnips: What's a tinder match I've never seen one

[0:37:41] Senyuno: New League dropped?
[0:37:42] vegandiamond: i knew it
[0:37:42] Apostolique: There's his bread and butter
[0:37:46] shinyclodsire: @kufuhu nilah was a loss, and a skip. lux is a loss, and we'll come back to her later cause she's a meta support

[0:38:13] Plahbie: I think losers q is cope but I understand why people think it exists
[0:38:22] nucularspider: give us the algorithm.
[0:38:23] shinyclodsire: purple/pink means they're a meta support that we lost with and will come back to later
[0:38:50] nucularspider: I thought they admitted that smurf/new account MMR is different than old account MMR?
[0:38:50] softlysupports: mhmm it tries to equalize u eavNod
[0:38:55] softlysupports: i wont be gaslighted by riot
[0:38:56] vegandiamond: just for fun :)
[0:39:13] pIasmate: stunt, thoughts on roa vs arch as support atm?
[0:39:20] ontopin: PreDetermining the account is stupid tho
[0:39:24] pezaxoryt: when i see multi season chall players doing a bronze to chall with a 90%+ wr in diamond go on a 20 lose streak, yeah i still believe in losers queue, and yes im coping because i suck ik
[0:39:51] pIasmate: roa gives an extra lvl though
[0:40:00] Apostolique: Loser's queue is real
[0:40:01] pIasmate: and it's cheaper now
[0:40:02] Senyuno: I mean we all know the algorithm naturally aggressively creates an uphill climb for you and then when they sufficiently beat the life out of you they hand you some pity RP to keep you in the Skinner box winning the same cycle of rank over and over again
[0:40:11] Apostolique: Don't let Rioters gaslight you
[0:40:16] Plahbie: @pIasmate point of supp champs is generally to be useful without levels\
[0:40:32] Plahbie: so the extra level isn't as useful as it is on like.. a midlaner
[0:40:34] Apostolique: We're almost at S Pog
[0:40:45] ontopin: Was ori meant to be sup?
[0:40:45] Lazynameross: sg ori walk anim is so cute

[3:21:05] PervySages: in Wild Rift, Ornn support is even more broken. Rather than upgrading items, they have it so when you build an item, your ally near you gets to build an item too
[3:21:09] PervySages: like why KEKW
[3:21:10] Lazynameross: smh scammed out of proper sup ornn game

[3:26:41] jp555jp: Is this pykes best skin now?
[3:26:51] coklov69: also push away his R with her R
[3:26:59] pIasmate: blind pyke and they almost all use hob

[4:00:28] ZuesesBeard: I seen that in moana
[4:00:34] pIasmate: what if the enemy support roams and you have a kill lane, wouldn't it be better to just kill the adc?

[4:02:40] Senyuno: Snow day Ziggs would catch hypothermia and die
[4:03:18] Lazynameross: snow day has access to ice and can deal lethal dmg easier
[4:03:19] mo0nx: pantheon adc xED ?
[4:03:19] RhymesWith0range: Wouldn't Pool Party Ziggs be the one to catch Hypothermia?
[4:03:21] ThomasTheTwink: adc qiyana

[4:05:23] ThomasTheTwink: with a hwei adc
[4:05:28] ThomasTheTwink: surely that was the sona
[4:05:29] pIasmate: adc is a rough role atm... I might try teemo adc just to get faster queue times
[4:05:30] Senyuno: Pool party wins
[4:05:50] Senyuno: 😁 thanks for playing
[4:05:53] Sharlyc: hitting the ground face first is not as bad as the back or side of the head

[4:06:44] ThomasTheTwink: hmm
[4:06:48] Senyuno: Watch Looney Tunes for the answer
[4:06:50] ThomasTheTwink: is that jhin or smolder adc
[4:06:54] Sharlyc: less dense if always better

[6:14:06] Lazynameross: teemo blind works with cheap shot so does it work with quinn q?

[6:18:18] BClarkTBE: what’s your win rate on this A-Z
[6:18:35] zionthegod: idk why people dodge Quinn support. It’s really not that bad. Super vision and can roam like crazy
[6:18:42] Kiwiguard: @BClarkTBE About 60%
[6:18:58] PervySages: my win rate in a-z is a brutal 40% LOL i am iron, did it in ranked, no role requirements, just get those mastery points, it took a looong time
[6:19:33] Lazynameross: i remember a tank support quinn otp in euw but havent heard anything about them since s12 or s13
[6:19:41] DudeBroMaximus: looking at your match history... is Kled support not even that bad?
[6:19:50] DudeBroMaximus: You lost but you were by far the best performer on tyeam

[6:20:54] exuvium: @tjdwns1291 Despairge
[6:21:07] Lazynameross: does e slow them for a bit afterward or its just the jostle?
[6:21:08] Mooky212: D:

[6:21:22] tjdwns1291: yup maybe next sesason
[6:21:47] exuvium: please fist your teammates
[6:21:51] DudeBroMaximus: lol
[6:22:18] PervySages: part of my inspiration for doing a-z, was maybe there is or is not a chance i climb, i don't know, but i have bronze or iron my whole life, except for a sure moment i 1 tricked Naut to silver. So, i am going to experience the whole game a-z, every role :) Got to Catch Em All
[6:22:40] Daebwyn: Do you have a playlist with these chill/lofi versions of songs? Don't think these are on !playlist command, only finding normal songs there on youtube
[6:22:41] Kuerious: we should normalize not leashing jgl imo they really dont need it
[6:23:09] DudeBroMaximus: everyone should just play shaco
[6:23:14] DudeBroMaximus: or jungs who don't like leash
[6:23:17] tjdwns1291: i dont want to be dia that bad for the grind to start all over for masters xD
[6:23:32] exuvium: @Kuerious my jg friend bitches about it incessantly if he doesnt get a leash
[6:23:32] YUMjori: do junglers actually need a leash, i don't see pro players leashing ever
[6:23:34] Kiwiguard: @Kuerious In higher elos, you dontleash anymore
[6:24:06] Kuerious: @Kiwiguard people still cry about leash in low masters
[6:24:37] Kiwiguard: Yes, because low masters has become inflated :D Agurin consistentlytalks about how bad leashing is usually
[6:24:44] zionthegod: I agree with meteos. he says leashing shouldn’t be part of the game really
[6:24:46] PervySages: leashing is only a requirement in the debts of low elo where i am, because if you get me doing a-z as your jungler, i will die to the camps even on a meta pick
[6:24:53] PervySages: although that is normal in the debts
[6:25:06] exuvium: depths
[6:27:53] Kiwiguard: Debt is something you owe :)
[6:29:01] zionthegod: think mf should buy the support item instead now. you take over adc
