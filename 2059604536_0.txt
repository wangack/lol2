[3:09:06] Hakuuxd: real estate is more expensive but its safer
[3:09:23] MonstrousYi: wats up
[3:09:37] XDa31: true cost of 1month without work is beyond 4000$
[3:09:49] xlr_omega: incoming
[3:09:55] Eomera: Real estate is not bether. If you buy a property you basicly finance 20% yourself so you have 4-5x gearing on your money. If you take the same risk in the stock marked it yields more. But in the stock marked you can get wiped out

[6:58:02] AdiosOcelote: Kick sometimes invites people to their partner program when they're known on other platforms. For example some people got partnered within the first hour of streaming, on Kick, only because they were partners on Twitch or YT @Cowsep
[6:58:29] SovietWrestler: @metalwrath22222 Lucky you. I gotta use two different extensions to block and skip ads. So many of them all the time on any channel.
