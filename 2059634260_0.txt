[0:30:46] g2batdan: I like how Star Wars is promoting the phantom menace coming back in to theatres like it’s not the worst Star Wars film or one of the worst at least
[0:31:09] zenlay: g2danman  jarjar binks is underrated and get too much hate
[0:31:31] zenlay: i freaking love star wars ep 1
[0:31:33] Mysticflyr: jarjar is a goat

[0:31:51] zenlay: i never understood the hate for him
[0:32:06] DatBla: Still, nothing beats andor as best star wars media for me
[0:32:23] Mysticflyr: that poor kayne,
[0:32:36] g2batdan: it’s not the worst I’ll give it that, my personal opinion is that the rise of sky walker is an absolute train wreck.
[0:32:37] DatBla: Lil grabby hand baron
[0:32:49] Mysticflyr: KEKW
[0:33:09] g2batdan: “somehow the emperor has returned” round of applause for that one
[0:33:17] zenlay: can they kist make star wars of the old repulic mobies already?

[0:37:00] DatBla: To be fair, I read the bell jar, the opposite of a cheery novel
[0:37:03] zenlay: at times i read books that is minimum 500-600 pages so XD
[0:37:21] zenlay: the wheel of times is great
[0:37:29] zenlay: time*

[0:37:39] g2batdan: @zenlay some I’ve read are 500+ and some are more like 200+
[0:37:49] zenlay: g2danman  yea
[0:38:13] zenlay: @MedicCasts  you read wheel of time?
[0:38:30] bliksemvis: Read the expanse by any chance?
[0:38:32] zenlay: i love it
[0:38:37] g2batdan: one I reading atm is called leviathan so is like 400-500 pages though is a tall book

[0:38:49] Dootchenhime: its good at the start, it just gets amazing at book 6
[0:38:50] zenlay: i read the whole series in about 2 ½ years
[0:38:57] Mysticflyr: bnooks 1-3 are ok, then the last three are god tier, if you can do audio books, listen to it
[0:39:09] zenlay: ken follet make banger books too

[0:39:29] g2batdan: you mean your fiance right @mediccasts ? ( congratulations again btw )
[0:39:40] Mysticflyr: are you looking forward to stormlight 5?
[0:39:44] shewasabulldozer: @crispytain haha we just have to hope they take it to a game 3 in bo3s/5 in bo5s as much as possible to at least catch the end of things
[0:39:48] zenlay: fouth wing is sooo good
[0:39:52] g2batdan: there is rugby on at the moment?
[0:39:55] zackweii: If someone doesn't die during the sex it's pointless moving on

[0:41:47] zackweii: Poggers
[0:42:00] g2batdan: did you guys know they are discontinuing breakaways
[0:42:12] zenlay: dragons dogma 2 dont have manual save only auto save.. will be kinda weird
[0:42:17] Big_Dannyy: hopefully mine will come out this year
[0:42:38] zenlay: granblue fantasy relink is fun
[0:42:47] g2batdan: no way you don’t know OhMyDog the chocolate biscuits they’re a UK staple, or I guess was..
[0:42:54] grrubidio37: Elden Ring dlc still no info sadge
[0:43:20] BeeRumble: awaree
[0:43:35] g2batdan: is the league mmo still a thing or has that been abandoned
[0:43:39] Mysticflyr: LEage 2 before the MMO? or after?
[0:43:39] grrubidio37: League 2 coming out before a functioning client lmao
[0:43:42] Salvrus: Not a buggy client
[0:43:44] ZeroDjinn: I want no elevation from the river!
[0:43:47] crispytain: silksong coming out this year Prayge
[0:43:52] Nesgamer: new engine and client, new modes
[0:44:08] Mysticflyr: the new map change?
[0:44:16] grrubidio37: New engine yeah so maybe the game doesnt break when you change aatrox passive
[0:44:18] Big_Dannyy: brotha thats called polishing LUL
[0:44:22] zenlay: i have a theory.. i think why silksong isent out yet or annoced yet.. that is becuse of "switch 2" isent annoced yet
[0:44:24] Matejvo7: same game - better client, no high-low ground, code it from scratch but better... no more spaghetti code xdd
[0:44:30] g2batdan: Have you seen smite though didnt port over the skins from smite 1 as it’d take them like several years to do it if they tried
[0:44:44] bubborama: Would like some mechanics changes, like removing multi-dashes and the "untargeable" status.
[0:44:50] Mysticflyr: @zenlay im genuinly shocked that the switch 2 has not been announced yet.
[0:44:54] zenlay: like ow 2 KEKW
[0:44:57] Big_Dannyy: if lol do make a second game, which i doubt
[0:45:01] shewasabulldozer: the 2 in league of legends 2 stands for bo2. every game you play now? bo2. aram? doesn’t matter. bo2.
[0:45:11] zenlay: Mysticflyr  i think it will happen at next diect
[0:45:18] BeeRumble: Give me an actual boss fight, not a Baron that gets killed within 5-10 seconds by everything.
[0:45:42] g2batdan: can you have a boss fight in a moba though
[0:45:45] zenlay: Mysticflyr  i also think switch 2 isent the realk next console.. but a switch pro, and the next big console comes out in 206/27
[0:45:46] Mysticflyr: @zenlay It has to, there are no planned games and nothing to look forward to,
[0:46:02] DKFirs: I would like to have skins that look like their artwork
[0:46:04] BeeRumble: Yeah I probably just mean a stronger Baron :D
[0:46:07] zenlay: @Mysticflyr paper mario ttyd remake?=?
[0:46:22] Big_Dannyy: i would expect a different map at least. I dont know the ins and outs of this game (bitme me chat, i dont play lol KEKW ) I want to see lol in a war kind of situation, like a 15 v15 or something crazy like that
[0:46:26] Mysticflyr: @zenlay I doubt they would announce a pro, with update4d SKU then a new console in 2/3 years,
[0:46:44] shewasabulldozer: league of legends 2 removes every champ players dislike, so after the whole complaints process you’re left with like singed, shyvana and skarner
[0:46:46] zenlay: @Mysticflyr we see it could happen
[0:47:01] Mysticflyr: @Mysticflyr I dont see that as a big thing to look forward to, IMO
[0:47:03] zenlay: rember they did it with 3ds and ds too
[0:47:18] Mysticflyr: @shewasabulldozer LEague 2 is 5v5 teemo onlyt
[0:47:26] Big_Dannyy: i have a question, am i the only one here taht does not play lol? am i the odd man out?
[0:47:48] zenlay: i dont get the idear with lol 2.. just look at ow 2.. its just a expoantion
[0:48:33] g2batdan: anyone else watched a show called, the west wing. I’m on the final season
[0:48:37] Mysticflyr: @Big_Dannyy nah, I dont play.
[0:49:03] Big_Dannyy: @Big_Dannyy o7 salute!
[0:49:05] shewasabulldozer: @mysticflyr ooh now you’re cooking!!
[0:49:29] Big_Dannyy: yeah, i agree, i enjoy my time spent here
[0:49:41] Salvrus: @Big_Dannyy Currently i dont play league too
[0:51:10] Mysticflyr: yea, coz any of your uitls saved him htere
[0:52:23] Mysticflyr: nah, I was agreeing wiht you, nothing saved viego.
[0:54:03] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[0:55:01] lollette: !rank

[0:56:48] Big_Dannyy: are there any tactics that you can employ if you get into a situation where youe enemy team is snowballing, if yes, wat are they
[0:58:00] shewasabulldozer: POV: You are Kaiser vs SK
[0:58:06] matchin95: Working out that you cant win this game I guess KEKW
[0:59:03] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.

[1:09:23] PlzN0: casting today, medic?
[1:10:03] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[1:10:44] goodvibes0n1y: the way i deal with that feeling is that i try and convince myself that i learned something in the game, and then that the lp i lost was the price of the lesson. so i got charged 22 lp to learn <x thing>
[1:10:46] Squallly: Good morning Medic, good morning chat!
[1:10:53] goodvibes0n1y: might not be real but its convinvcing self talk xD
[1:10:54] FoxyLuxana: whats better? losing a game where u were solo carrying or winning a game were u were losing mega hard as a laner but the rest was stomping

[1:13:02] LUCYXZ1337: MEDIC!
[1:13:03] einfachjules: I played Milio with Smolder, it was great!
[1:13:05] ReplayKay: Milio for the range extend
[1:13:12] sirwicked83: engage supports
[1:13:16] Rilea_: Yup
[1:13:21] Squallly: american nonsense
[1:13:24] Squallly: :p
[1:13:29] ReplayKay: I've had fun with Zyra too, but I'm silver
[1:13:35] Rilea_: It stresses me out so much
[1:13:37] LUCYXZ1337: i am so not in favour of this colourless change
[1:13:55] Mysticflyr: thoughts on smoulder so far?
[1:14:01] Heylon: cause he's smol
[1:14:25] crispytain: GIGAMEDIC barum

[1:21:53] einfachjules: Its too hard for teammates to read pings xD
[1:23:30] Silfel: It worked out medicAYAYA
[1:24:03] StreamElements: Please sub, it costs a lot to have hair this good and a fashion sense.
[1:25:04] pikselonix: it will take some time before people realise to just let smolder scale and get a free win late
[1:27:33] einfachjules: @pikselonix I feel like this is the hardest thing for many players. they go 0/1 and they just fight over and over again to "fix" their lane. but they make it even worse. 0/10 toplaner incoming i guess
[1:28:02] Silfel: Smolder is the clear wincon
[1:28:09] FoxyLuxana: play around bot yesyes
