[2:37:23] zagreus7274: Mortal reminder did something but she just so crazy she still 1v9s
[2:39:19] xianitas: what kinda buffs do you feel sett needs to be able to match?
[2:39:30] zagreus7274: I say mortal did more than bramble ever will
[2:39:41] zagreus7274: But fiora to crazy
[2:39:49] comeonconman: Nice stats you got there  aut0Grab
[2:39:56] Brenoou_: Brenoou_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hello auto-chan good luck in your games, pls play Sett, enough of Mordekaiser he gives me diarrhea
[2:40:33] Brenoou_: Getting gaped by Fiora late game?
[2:41:29] zagreus7274: At that point skarner would do more to fiora lmao
[2:41:32] comeonconman: Time for Drastic Measures: Exhaust
[2:42:06] zagreus7274: Idk if exhaust would help
[2:42:12] zagreus7274: Cause she also dashes
[2:42:22] Brenoou_: Riot just refuses to buff Sett I dunno why, why the champion needs to be male Ahri? 2 skins pee year but he's so average compared to his match-up, just like Ahri popularity doesn't do us any good aut0T
[2:42:24] comeonconman: imagine you exhaust while she W'S AND YOU JUST LOSE IT
[2:43:48] label939: fiora has a 53% wr in masters+ WTF
[2:43:52] comeonconman: An Item that enforces grounded could be cool to stop dashes. Like a deadmans effect of grounded
[2:44:31] Brenoou_: @label939 every sundered sky abusers and Riot don't nerf them
[2:45:33] zagreus7274: Honestly at this point it's better to ban fiora than a Jax or rene cause then you wound at least have a chance lmao
[2:45:59] xianitas: you gonna play rebirth after crisis core?
[2:47:31] xianitas: yeah thats kinda insane that you left lane like 8/3 and still cant match after a point
[2:47:47] comeonconman: A lot of the higher elo people I talk to say stuff like "aw hes fine I played X when they had a 46% wr", but like, his kit is so simple that you need those stats to keep up
[2:48:08] comeonconman: 46% wr K'Sante or Illaoi still crazy strong cause utility
[2:48:31] label939: remember sett used to be so popular always picked now only 2% of players pick him KEKW
[2:49:05] comeonconman: @label939 Back when he had more MR then Yuumi and his regen (his entire passive) was actually good

[3:07:12] comeonconman: I saw a cool idea somewhere for a sett buff where his E stun duration scales with how many champions he pulls, cool concept
[3:07:16] zagreus7274: There has to be a legit reason why riot no buff sett
[3:08:01] comeonconman: HOOOOOOOOOOOLY
[3:08:35] zaid_2030: viego think he has bigger biceps
[3:08:45] zagreus7274: @comeonconman I made one where when sett starts glowing like yk when he gets high grit. He gets a dmg buff for his auto attacks. But when he uses his W it's all gone
[3:09:11] comeonconman: OOOOO that one is super cool
[3:09:54] zagreus7274: Makes u learn to save ur grit for higher aa dmg but if u need the burst u can use W
[3:10:37] comeonconman: Thats an amazing idea, too amazing for rito games
[3:10:48] zagreus7274: Yea it is
[3:11:09] comeonconman: if we DO get a buff its gonna be like.....sett q scaling up 10%

[3:13:59] comeonconman: He hasnt been higher than bottom B tier in 2 years

[3:14:43] zagreus7274: @comeonconman I also thought of sett Q giving MS in all directions but only a tiny bit, but when u face a champ that MS is increased more
[3:15:31] comeonconman: RIOT SAMIRA KATARINA
[3:15:44] comeonconman: These champs can do this but when ur 8/0 ur a minion
[3:17:08] comeonconman: @zagreus7274 I like this to. I feel like setts current MS from q is terrible since his base speed is so slow
[3:18:11] zagreus7274: Yea and he just gets kited around so ez

[7:13:38] Shonji2611: Ksante woulda died if he didn't get an out with his R
[7:13:59] shabladuub: they must be boosted
[7:14:00] amiro2000: @Shonji2611 he would do his ult anyway
[7:14:23] Shonji2611: I mean yeah, but if he doesn't go through a wall, he doesn't really move.
[7:14:26] amiro2000: cuz he cant be stun and throw you into the wall while hes w is on
[7:14:28] shabladuub: what a fun champion!

[7:15:50] Shonji2611: And he is still one of the best top laners
[7:16:08] amiro2000: hes the most pick rate in higher elo

[7:45:48] amiro2000: @Thaolin nid...
[7:46:12] Thaolin: some people want to feel big in their pants even though they aren't, these people play ranged top laners
[7:46:34] tezi777: xD
[7:46:43] amiro2000: LMAO
[7:47:18] amiro2000: classic nid
[7:47:24] Thaolin: what's crazy is that she falls off so hard mid game
[7:47:38] Thaolin: its like a vayne top, sure you win lane phase but you're useless to your team comp
[7:48:02] amiro2000: @Thaolin na she is even worse then vayne top
[7:48:46] Thaolin: imagine playing nidalee top and being this sweaty
[7:49:19] Yurlhardt: mornin all
[7:49:38] amiro2000: @Thaolin she is even tankier then vayne
[7:49:56] Thaolin: lame, never gone up against her top
[7:50:06] zaid_2030: lol
[7:50:29] Thaolin: what good is she after lane phase though?
[7:50:39] oFabee: what does she build? bruiser itens, ap?
[7:51:00] amiro2000: u know what riot should do?
[7:51:20] amiro2000: if u pick range top lane they should give u less stats
[7:51:39] amiro2000: they should do that
[7:51:39] Thaolin: just give melee champions base auto attack armor
[7:51:59] amiro2000: @Thaolin YEP
[7:52:19] amiro2000: also mid only assassin champion and mages
[7:52:35] Thaolin: makes it harder to kill melee supports bot, etc. All melee champs should have tabi reduction automatically these days
[7:53:02] Yurlhardt: We still in challanger
[7:53:05] Yurlhardt: ?
[7:53:12] Thaolin: these season at least, lol - you get kited and obliterated as melee unless you're building full tank
[7:53:57] Thaolin: or at least make is to melee classes get a base ranged AA reduction like tabis
[7:54:01] amiro2000: @Thaolin funny cuz assassin is *weak* against tanks
[7:54:37] Thaolin: tell that to the akali that deleted my ornn last night in .6 seconds
[7:54:51] amiro2000: riot keep saying assassin is *weak* against tanks
[7:55:09] Thaolin: riot doesn't know wtf is going on with this game anymore - did you see the ASOL "rework" ?
[7:55:21] Thaolin: they've had to rework every champ released in the past year over and over
[7:55:52] amiro2000: the nerf that asol got made him weaker then they thought
[7:56:13] zaid_2030: crystal item + brazil gg no one escape
[7:56:31] Thaolin: putting phreak in charge of balance cinched not playing ranked anymore for me
[7:57:09] Thaolin: but I've been playing this game for like 11 years or something like that so I'm just over it
[7:57:26] amiro2000: man i wanna deleted phreak from the  list and add riot aug into lead
[7:57:40] Thaolin: take that nidalee to brazil
[7:57:43] zaid_2030: she is really  fighting u in brazil in melee range
[7:57:50] きょむ1902: nice
[7:57:52] tezi777: dearest karthus
[7:58:18] Thaolin: @amiro2000 basically - this season is Phreak's first real rework season and its a clusterfuck :P
[7:58:52] Thaolin: guy makes great rundown videos but then ignores his own advice and makes changes based on data alone and not expertise
[7:58:57] oFabee: anivia got a carnaval skin. it should have been morde LUL
[7:59:37] Thaolin: old god mord is best mord
