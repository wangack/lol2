[1:04:15] random67596: @Naayil they should deleate fleet footwork, worst designed keystone in the game
[1:04:17] blynjubitr: but whenever adc players can't be 10/0 in lane they complain
[1:04:20] jeonsoyeonbestgirl: @shinsora_ its just annoying to have ranged top lanes but i think teemo is tolerable than this vayne matchup
[1:04:27] Emil92DK: is claver good against Garen?
[1:04:36] Aarguil: @Aarguil tbh she was shit then, but now with all the ms inflation and the early buffs she's disgusting

[2:05:37] thecheeseender: even if minions have a cooldown on autoattacks, it shouldn't reset their aggro
[2:05:42] natsudragneeldsf: it was based on 20 hours since last dodge not on the day u dodge
[2:05:46] huyanii: this is going to be a STOMP

[2:08:28] Hiragaku: am calling phreak
[2:08:35] Migiccc: cause they hate you
[2:08:35] quckquckk: because you are unfair
[2:08:35] shinsora_: to make us depressed
[2:08:36] Rodro4: they want you to play earlier
[2:08:38] huyanii: what is the point of dodge timer in the first place?
[2:08:46] natsudragneeldsf: Because Lil Nas was there and made K Sante
[2:08:50] pyro_ab: bc RIOT
[2:08:51] quckquckk: your just to unbalanced for the game
[2:08:53] G_ANIR: lets goo

[2:09:10] natsudragneeldsf: Get good at 90s
[2:09:14] natsudragneeldsf: :))
[2:09:21] G_ANIR: riot stream sniping
[2:09:25] Tiguy01: Like doesnt make sense but they thought, when penalty is 5 minutes, the coldown is 24 hours. Soo when its 12 hours penalty the coldown still remains 24 hours. Just that
[2:09:31] Spinksv: @Naayil Do u have any recommendations to get better at top?
[2:09:35] Rodro4: the ban is 20 hours but they let you play after 12 hours so you can continue playing
[2:09:37] opueyy: ask for vayne ban
[2:09:38] MingDufd: go play palworld instead
[2:09:43] G145KA: ill give u a good argument, riot is only an indie company idk why u expect them to have such perfect game
[2:09:45] G_ANIR: @Spinksv get better
[2:09:56] seifgost2: cuz the 12h is a punishment they don't want you to dodge the game  but the 20h cd is for like ok we will give you one dodge without punshiment cuz it might be your pc crashed or the power cutted off
[2:10:03] Tiguy01: @naayil Like doesnt make sense but they thought, when penalty is 5 minutes, the coldown is 24 hours. Soo when its 12 hours penalty the coldown still remains 24 hours. Just that
[2:10:08] G_ANIR: play urf
[2:10:10] G_ANIR: mybe
[2:10:13] G_ANIR: it's fun
[2:10:24] guldaneeee: @Naayil its just like the bug where you get -8 gold from killing grubs if you have jungler itm penality there is no purpose they just forgot to think about it its sad
[2:10:24] aesvh: did you already played against tiky
[2:10:26] DevAlmir_: @G_ANIR urf and fun

[2:14:16] goodnightx33: Where do people even read who dodged
[2:14:17] lekkiv: relax man,  jsut WHY NOT
[2:14:19] guldaneeee: its like the fact where the message tab dosnt show in champ select and a rioter said it was on purpose just so we know 24h later that they fked up and it wasnt intended
[2:14:22] shinju_furina: @redziriuss delete lol
[2:14:24] Le_g0ni: Imo the timeban is actually useless
