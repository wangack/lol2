[1:39:15] RJchiller: Never take inhib before 20 mins just ping ur team back
[1:39:28] masados: gold graph will be interesting
[1:39:31] juhiizRS: The top inhib was really bad. Basically deleted 1/3 of lane income.

[1:40:44] shadowsapiens: its more about stopping draven and not letting him free farm x0r6ztGiggle
[1:40:46] nutcrackerr: bot is kind of the main lane to gank especiallt vs draven, but trhat's why maokai is so op he just stops every gank in one button
[1:40:52] GralekNeig: @Phandoms he pinked enemy blue once tho
[1:41:02] hydrated_boy_: Im not saying hecarim is the issue, but have you thought about throwing another 'main' champ in the rotation?
[1:41:03] Phandoms: @Phandoms aight didnt see that
[1:41:25] PrinceXerxes: if this games ends up a loss then we can confirm that Maokai is cursed for you. Somehow does good even if losing on the enemy team, boosted trash on your team.
