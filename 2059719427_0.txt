[3:29:49] auzreal: die harder
[3:30:27] auri_sariel: @Santorin from what i heard you cant costream unless youre part of a team, like Caedrel being part of FNC
[3:30:46] irouskan1: antilhKEKW
[3:31:17] auzreal: @auri_sariel Well if Shopify was smart they'd get Santorin to represent
[3:31:33] auzreal: Cuz I'm looking for a team to root for
[3:31:51] auri_sariel: @auzreal LCS has more loose rules on costreaming, there u dont need to be part of a team, but if you want to costream LEC you need to be part of a team
[3:31:51] hippy_fry: how does Santorin not have a streaming deal with a team???
[3:31:53] auzreal: #teamless fan fuck tsm

[3:33:25] hippy_fry: idk if he‚Äôs interested but lpl has pretty loose rules and from what I heard are quick to give rights when you‚Äôre recommended or something similar
[3:34:30] auri_sariel: I think Santorini could easily get LCS costream rights, but he gotta send em a message
[3:34:34] auzreal: truth
[3:35:40] auri_sariel: LEC has probably the most strict rules when it comes to costreaming
[3:36:14] hippy_fry: felt, its practically impossible to watch eastern leagues for me being in the u.s. they typically start between 1-3am
[3:37:39] raw_image: @santorin is it optimal to do a full clear in the first clear atm in league?
[3:38:32] raw_image: I hate that playstyle but i feel its kind of hard to pull of early ganks
[3:38:40] raw_image: But im a bad player that's why I asked

[4:55:48] Lysandren: I OTPed zyra back in the day
[4:55:57] Ingenuitee8: I'll stick with tank supps then hahaha
[4:56:55] getsometalentloser: @Ingenuitee8 pick u bard
[4:57:07] Lysandren: tank supports always have the ability to punish when enemy is out of position, even if they're behind.

[5:05:39] Jhodeib: 5 > 4
[5:06:46] Lysandren: Phroxon said that according to riot metrics, if your support is below a certain threshold, it's actually the worst role to be gapped in measured by winrate.
[5:07:02] louiecheese: can you explain why zyra so bad? team comp wise legit question
[5:07:52] jaegermech: @louiecheese its the player
[5:08:11] Lysandren: @louiecheese part of it is bc nidalee wants the enemy to not build mr.
[5:08:12] Jhodeib: lich bane = full build?
[5:09:04] louiecheese: I see
[5:09:46] Lysandren: i think another part is that tristana wants to play aggressive early, and zyra into p antheon doesn't enable that
[5:09:56] Lysandren: as panth has perma kill threat on zyra
[5:10:19] Ingenuitee8: I NEED A HERO
