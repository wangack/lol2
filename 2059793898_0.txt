[1:11:59] brandonstarrk: weird kassadin

[3:19:02] BluerBlack: why are you doing with w first not q?
[3:19:12] BluerBlack: I thought that q have better ad scaling
[3:19:37] VengfulDark: It's old Tristana laning logic.
[3:20:05] VengfulDark: Kog also used to do the same thing for a while.
[3:20:44] BluerBlack: I would think that q would be better even if you have less range
[3:20:48] VengfulDark: Kog may still put 3 points E first. he's just super unpopular
[3:20:52] BluerBlack: I guess its preference thingy
[3:22:10] VengfulDark: W is wave clear and poke at the same time before Q gets 25 stacks.
[3:23:02] VengfulDark: and the range is super important in early levels
[3:23:21] BluerBlack: But you can cast lvl 3 q more than two times of w
[3:23:31] YamK_: Jhin got deleted
[3:23:35] BluerBlack: and you get similar damage per cast I think
[3:23:55] BluerBlack: And you want last hits not clear I would think
[3:23:59] YamK_: wp guys
[3:24:44] YamK_: how much damage does the middle part of your ult do
[3:24:53] BluerBlack: The only advantage of w that I can see is range but its slow in near the end
[3:25:16] VengfulDark: Also it's AOE, and Burst damage

[4:51:54] minismile_: hi poteet
[4:51:55] minismile_: how r u
[4:51:57] VVIZRRD: I do agree that the Jungle Viego who did barely half the damage of Zilean Support was the problem.
[4:52:12] minismile_: im abt to sleep 5upNap
[4:52:36] thesalsaking: @VVIZRRD he just seemed lost, i call an incoming dive, and hes farming wolves
[4:52:53] PoteetLee: Hi mini.

[4:57:57] VVIZRRD: Last night, my team had a top lane Jhin who didn't leave top lane until our inhibs were falling.

[5:00:53] XortedI: good start
[5:00:58] PoteetLee: But I am like wildly tired now.
[5:01:11] VVIZRRD: The snare can be extremely useful against aggressive engages.

[5:31:03] BluerBlack: Anivia Pog
[5:31:03] VengfulDark: I think my favorite thing was a pure solo queue team where all 5 of us were on exactly the same page @AkitaAttribute So then we decided to 5 stack in flex no coms and have 100% win rate
[5:31:09] 9fierce9: Rank 1 Smolder title how I will miss you
[5:31:14] XortedI: really
[5:31:26] XortedI: interesting
[5:31:45] VengfulDark: We were not winning lanes or anything, but we would just all roam at exactly the right times and show up to objectives at the same time
[5:32:01] BluerBlack: I think ad smolder only works with good team
[5:32:09] vDaishar: Yeah it made out harder to big carry the creatures
[5:32:19] BluerBlack: For me it looked like ap you had much easier time with bad team
[5:32:59] VengfulDark: Burn Smolder looks like it would go better when they have 2 tanks
[5:33:09] Hayase64: In pro they play "fasting" Senna
[5:33:12] VengfulDark: Also Seraphine should be the one farming.
[5:33:19] Hayase64: Support farm
[5:34:06] VengfulDark: Seraphine is just a better APC or mid laner then Support because her kit wants gold, and then Senna wants to poke
[5:34:14] BluerBlack: Shacko always was op with early ganks
[5:34:23] 9fierce9: om
[5:34:45] VengfulDark: is that the enemy or the ally?

[5:38:24] pureiinsanity: control yourself 5up
[5:38:36] VengfulDark: You would have needed your Support as well
[5:39:10] VengfulDark: This is one of those games you just farm and focus on yourself.
[5:39:11] 9fierce9: I do hear a bit of emotions coming out
[5:39:14] imicefire: @pureiinsanity i can see this joke running for a long time lmfao
[5:39:24] XortedI: senna is farming...
[5:40:12] VengfulDark: @XortedI yeah, we thought that was weird
[5:40:14] VVIZRRD: Jungle telling the support where to be? Interesting.
[5:41:04] AkitaAttribute: How does he understand macro if he thinks inting isn't bad macro
[5:41:30] VengfulDark: It's not macro it's he wants grubs.
[5:41:46] VengfulDark: he sees jungle objective and just wants to do it
[5:42:12] coolwaveofcalm: idk if anyone else mentioned it, but Mr. Up you don't have a map cover on

[5:46:13] klerikvaira: map cover, 5up
[5:46:34] BluerBlack: ^
[5:46:36] Gragnoth: senna sera is an op lane with fasting senna, because sera can clear waves so quickly and then they just poke the enemy to death
[5:46:48] kidvoet: was that faker movement????

[5:57:53] Narsils_Shards: You can hold alt
[5:58:12] VengfulDark: ok, I thought it was ctrl
[5:58:16] coolwaveofcalm: press alt and click on the item to show how much gold you need until you can buy it
[6:01:43] VengfulDark: normally the enemy team curses azir AOE
[6:02:10] VengfulDark: I think it's only good into like 3 tanks
[6:02:27] VengfulDark: because you need to be fighting for like 5 seconds before it even stacks up
[6:02:59] pureiinsanity: senna does dmg Kappa
[6:03:47] pureiinsanity: Senna starts with 600 range no?
[6:04:03] coolwaveofcalm: Zhonyas might be best for Shaco
[6:04:08] 9fierce9: Zhonyas for shaco?
[6:04:10] pureiinsanity: on wiki it says 600
[6:04:18] VengfulDark: it just feels like 600 because of how oppresive she in lane
[6:04:36] pureiinsanity: it should be 600
[6:04:38] VengfulDark: It feels like Cait range sometimes
[6:06:01] 52PlukkOpp: Zhonyas seraphine ICANT

[6:08:17] 52PlukkOpp: Senna adc is terrible
[6:08:23] Gragnoth: I mean fasting senna adc is fine
[6:08:33] 52PlukkOpp: @Gragnoth but thats not adc :P
[6:08:48] cameron416: you dont farm
[6:08:49] 52PlukkOpp: Fasting senna adc = you take support item and dont farm haha
[6:08:52] Hayase64: Senna don't hit minions support do
[6:08:52] Gragnoth: basically it's support senna with a tank or a mage with high wave clear
[6:09:02] Gragnoth: but you go an adc build on her
[6:09:05] Gragnoth: and go for all the kills
[6:09:06] VengfulDark: Fasting Senna is support senna with a Melee support who is the carry
[6:09:09] cameron416: like senna tahm or senna cho, etc
[6:09:17] Gragnoth: agreed, farming senna is bad
[6:09:21] FrozenLavaReflector: including pro players?

[6:16:31] cameron416: ye
[6:17:07] VengfulDark: What is it about Varus where he just wins every lane?
[6:17:23] BluerBlack: q poke

[6:22:50] cameron416: she's been gone for over 2 mins lol
[6:22:58] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I don't mind if they roam and come back, but just perma-leaving is bad unless your ADC has good escapes.
[6:24:03] coolwaveofcalm: I had a Sett support yesterday who was perma-roaming and we lost the game and he and our initing WW blamed me for it
[6:24:21] coolwaveofcalm: as if I wasn't being 2v1ed in lane since level 2
[6:25:02] VVIZRRD: Janna's whole toolkit is largely designed to benefit the ADC specifically.

[6:27:51] BluerBlack: Im curious have you ever tried EU, if so what was your ping?
[6:27:58] VVIZRRD: @notevyatar0 I know right? I miss Galeforce.

[6:35:33] cameron416: "Satoru Uchiha" the camille might be league's biggest weeb
[6:35:35] BluerBlack: Like it used to be in 3vs3 I think

[6:41:09] VVIZRRD: Oh yeah, that is how it happened. Good eye.
[6:41:25] VVIZRRD: I'll admit, I've used Eve ult to close gaps myself.
[6:42:08] cameron416: camille just rushed in whenever her e is up it's stressing me sb

[6:59:00] cameron416: just like notre dame the american university is not pronounced the way it should be
[6:59:07] VVIZRRD: If the team pronounces it 'seltics', the team is wrong.
[6:59:30] 9fierce9: Team is wrong and should be defunded
[6:59:35] coolwaveofcalm: Whether that's how it should be pronounced, that I can't speak on

[7:03:57] 9fierce9: Ohio doesnt exist
[7:04:08] Dathrelian: is there another way to say it?
[7:04:09] cameron416: @TheShnax i feel like this is a consequence of ppl opening a new tab and entering google in the url, and bc google is their search engine it's googling iteslf

[7:55:00] xxKnowledgerxx: i feel like ryze is just such a hard champion to play properly. But the last time I played him was 4 years ago
[7:55:08] xxKnowledgerxx: he just didnt click for me
[7:55:45] Fossabot: Merch? We got that. Check it out here: https://5upmerch.com
[7:56:48] notevyatar0: are you a adc or mid main?
[7:56:55] BluerBlack: I mean any champ with like only 3 useful abilities is hard to play
[7:56:59] 9fierce9: Hes a flex player @notevyatar0
[7:57:20] xxKnowledgerxx: good point bluerblack
[7:57:21] BluerBlack: Yuumi main supp Kappa
[7:57:28] notevyatar0: @9fierce9 all lanes?
[7:57:36] zatyna_: do you level w second on ryze?
[7:58:01] 9fierce9: @notevyatar0, He can play all the lanes to a diamond elo standard, but mid and ADC is what he has more fin with
[7:58:40] notevyatar0: @9fierce9 thats dope ty
[7:58:47] tim_dice: they prolly have wards up
[7:59:06] VVIZRRD: Snare is mainly once a fight anyway.

[8:00:41] VVIZRRD: E does, yes.
[8:00:55] JustaStoopidDog: that was like ryze 3.0 or something
[8:01:30] AkitaAttribute: One thing I don't see non pro Ryze players doing, is E the same target twice, and it spreads further.

[8:09:07] g0ld123: noice
[8:09:15] AkitaAttribute: Ghost to lane for real lol
[8:10:49] FrozenLavaReflector: ghost to lane is viable, but only inceartian scenarios imo
[8:10:52] BluerBlack: why it wouldnt?
[8:11:05] zatyna_: are u running nimbus cloak or nah?
[8:11:09] VVIZRRD: Teleport is great for doing one thing. Ghost is pretty good for doing six things.

[8:12:30] thekatherine: riot wants you back in the depths

[8:16:37] Januous: its how many marshmallows you can fit in your mouth
[8:16:38] 9fierce9: Isnt that a kink test or something?
[8:16:43] SorayaSayo: google it
[8:17:21] zatyna_: there's no way these are accurate
[8:17:58] Januous: this super bowl party is so fucking boring that i am laughing at literally everything happening on this stream
[8:18:25] pureiinsanity: ahri support what in the what

[8:20:52] thekatherine: h&m is a world wide brand
[8:20:56] Januous: good lord
[8:21:08] Januous: never say anything remotely close to that sentence again
[8:21:12] 9fierce9: What a terrible day to have eyes
[8:21:46] peakaspect: ^
[8:22:26] SorayaSayo: gn 5up & chat!
[8:22:44] BluerBlack: wow what a boring chat
[8:23:21] zatyna_: KEWK
[8:23:21] peakaspect: @sorayasayo gn!
[8:23:35] Joker_GGEZ: Did he play that higher lower game
[8:24:12] BluerBlack: Wait
[8:24:28] BluerBlack: is that ahri as support?
[8:25:13] 9fierce9: You just noticed that?
[8:25:26] BluerBlack: YEP
[8:25:45] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: To be fair to Bluer she has barely done anything.
[8:26:12] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: @Joker_GGEZ Yes and we have found out that he doesn't believe the numbers it gives him when he is wrong.
[8:26:13] BluerBlack: Listen, my knowledge about game is before riot decided to mess up every champ
[8:26:33] BluerBlack: This would be something like insane tech even on random when I played
[8:27:23] BluerBlack: I remember ahri as mid ap
[8:27:30] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I mean, it's not normal now and for good reason, Ahri thrives off levels and items... neither of which you get as support, but I assume she is an autofilled one trick.
[8:28:08] Joker_GGEZ: that's definitely him spoons 💀😭
[8:28:44] maverickx29: dolphinLUL
[8:28:49] 9fierce9: om
[8:29:22] BluerBlack: why?
[8:29:29] BluerBlack: you just need some cc
[8:29:48] BluerBlack: and then he is shit when you break him catching blades
[8:29:54] 9fierce9: i hate draven, every aspect of him i despise
[8:30:41] Fossabot: Come join the Discord community to hangout with other viewers: https://discord.gg/5up
[8:30:54] zatyna_: game quality has plummeted LULW
[8:31:41] BluerBlack: Funny enough I think actually ahri is good for that lane
[8:31:53] BluerBlack: Her taunt wrecks him
[8:32:05] BluerBlack: charm*
[8:32:21] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Anyone would be good for this lane if they have any CC. These guys started running it down as soon as they stopped stomping in early game.
[8:33:04] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Nocturne hates Fiora apparently.
[8:33:51] BluerBlack: You know there is also one more champ I think we never saw recently on stream
[8:34:06] xxKnowledgerxx: much counterplay, such wow
[8:34:11] BluerBlack: Rammus
[8:34:43] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: He's still played a little, but they wrecked his ult(imo).
[8:35:02] xxKnowledgerxx: you were there for emotional support
[8:35:06] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I definitely saw him on A stream of league recently. Not sure if it was here or not.
[8:35:46] BluerBlack: 5up have you seen Rammus recently?
[8:36:07] Kurogane22773: What champ is 5up playing?
[8:36:21] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Jinx.
[8:36:23] BluerBlack: Jinx
[8:36:37] Kurogane22773: Ah red skin.. thnx
[8:36:41] BluerBlack: I think this champ is kinda known
[8:36:46] BluerBlack: for the music video
[8:37:27] BluerBlack: oh
[8:37:32] BluerBlack: that was 10 years ago
[8:37:34] unr3al_2468: nice lmao
[8:37:37] BluerBlack: FeelsOldMan
[8:38:55] superfreak123: !rank
[8:38:56] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond III 67 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[8:39:16] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: It hurts me a little when someone types the !rank command now.
[8:39:44] xxKnowledgerxx: nami?
[8:39:45] superfreak123: lol
[8:40:01] Anteaterz1: no
[8:40:44] zatyna_: >5 cs/min PogU
[8:41:05] lavfully: !rank
[8:41:06] Fossabot: 5up is currently Diamond III 67 LP. Use !ranks for other games.
[8:41:13] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I mean, at least Rammus is rare enough all the newer players probably have no idea how to play vs. him.
[8:43:06] Azrael_Of_The_Lost: Nocturn really has it out  for your ass
[8:43:43] Fossabot: @BluerBlack, Please ask for permission to post a link. [warning]
[8:43:55] Kurogane22773: Enemy team wanted ur ass
[8:44:11] BluerBlack: Jinx trailer is more than 10 years old FeelsOldMan
[8:44:12] vDaishar: If being the bait works then fuck it
[8:44:32] BluerBlack: They have only one known song
[8:44:32] unr3al_2468: average adc vs nocturne game
[8:44:36] jeskieKAT: BEP BLUBBERS
[8:45:03] lavfully: save the children lower than playstation vr feelsbadman

[8:45:28] jeskieKAT: om
[8:45:32] decepticontechnoorganic: it was physiologist not psychologist lmao
[8:45:34] girl_rat: THAT was a PHYSIOLOGIST
[8:45:34] auraizen: physiologust not psychologist lmao
[8:45:38] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: That was physiologist not psychiatrist.
[8:45:47] Hoax415: literally who
[8:45:48] jeskieKAT: It's a UK retail company
[8:45:49] mcmatt327: oof 5up

[8:46:00] lavfully: you have to remember if there's a reason to google it. why would i google just "golf"
[8:46:02] mcmatt327: civil rights leader John Lewis

[8:46:30] Hoax415: canada
[8:46:34] Hoax415: your canada is showing
[8:46:54] Hoax415: lala land huge in Nicaragua makes sense
[8:46:54] jeskieKAT: KEKW
[8:47:17] lavfully: have you tried google feud?
[8:47:54] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: Apparently a La La Land musical started up, 5UP, so I assume the searches are for tickets and showtimes and shit.
[8:47:54] BluerBlack: Its avarage, not last month right?
[8:47:56] jeskieKAT: peepoTalk sports direct dot com UK's number one
[8:48:23] BluerBlack: So you can have one spike that wrecks avarage
[8:49:18] vviras: "A frustratingly addictive game of higher or lower using Google searches. The data is based on global monthly searches in 2017"
[8:49:47] Januous: and now im being dragged into the abyss of socializing with other people noooooo
[8:49:54] Januous: i must depart my dear chatters
[8:49:56] jeskieKAT: YEP
[8:50:04] NoSpoonsLeftOnlyKnives: I mean most people use google like a url. Just type what you want in your address bar, it googles it for you automatically, you click on the actual link. I would assume that is how retail stores are so high.
[8:50:05] ChimeZee: no :c
[8:50:07] KeirianGSG: is this W max build?
