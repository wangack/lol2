Then you learn more about the game itself, what state it is in, wave management, when to rotate etc. etc.  Then you will end up like me in silver

[5:00:52] the_realpantheon: @slamhk ty but ik the ins and outs of gp and panth the problems is the macro and my teams that feed and proceed to fight outnumbered, one game they told me i needed to carry but proceeded to feed the mf and never help me when mf was alone

[5:01:26] Amerdisiac: @Amerdisiac you dont develop by spamming games you develop by understanding what went wrong in certain games and what you needed to do to fix it, matches arent the same in norms since people arent trying as hard and picks are also different. if you actually wanna get better vod review is number 1

[5:02:39] spectereye: since u dont even know what to look for

[5:03:24] slamhk: @spectereye ye vod reviews are just searching for a needle in a haystack. The only times is when you don't understand what went wrong, and then you check. But vod reviewing like every game you lost won't give you much
[5:03:25] the_realpantheon: @spectereye im good at csing, i get like 7/8 cs per min
