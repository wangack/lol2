[0:38:26] kingprime: I got 13lp in my flex games yesterday ... xD
[0:38:42] HAYB3AR: Yesterday I lost a game, lost 26 LP, I won a game, won 26LP. Lost the next game and lost 35 LP????????? I got off after lol
[0:38:56] TyrTheTiny: I always hated the fact that sett gets to build tank and does damage or damage and gets tanky, plus that thing when you are about to kill him and he gets a shield, reflects damage and it's true damage. nasty ass champ
[0:39:00] QTwinkyyy: I swear it's like Riot literally forces you back to plat, watch you lose like 30 after a loss
[0:39:03] TyrTheTiny: sorry for the vent :c
[0:39:07] pistolpetey34: im scared to paly ranked, as i asked lucas losing 34lp and gaining 16

[0:40:34] CrazySzopen: !EU
[0:40:34] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[0:40:50] nayeonrs: hii kay
[0:41:19] ericaborgest: hello riot
[0:41:22] Smoothcollie: Oh ye Kels, u are trying to jebait us, u are definitelly not emerald, back to bronze with ya kaypShame
[0:41:28] SykoKing02: what youre talking about is the exact reason iv given up on this game all together. its just not worth playing anymore
[0:41:29] petaa16: swear to god its so weird because how can i be put in a game with GOOD players 8 times in a row and then loose 10?
[0:41:33] paraxona: I also just currently sit on low emerald and win 18 and lose 22

[0:42:01] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea yeah I hope so too. Had an adc that died to draven and ran it down because apparently mid and jungle was supposed to do something about them playing bad?
[0:42:09] bemyresset: they swear they don’t make us lose lp
[0:42:13] padampadamm: im in emerald and every second game is absolute rubish players who have no idea what they're doing somehow
[0:42:14] Sx10: kaypVibe kaypVibe kaypVibe

[0:43:18] ani671: Youuuu are vs better...but your team is vs better BETTER!!!
[0:43:19] Smoothcollie: Trying to pretend like there is no loser/toxic queue is such a joke
[0:43:19] bemyresset: kaypea you always speak facts!!
[0:43:22] monkeyboness: love your content!
[0:43:25] Niomah: The letter grades are stupid too. I played two Heimer games in a row, Went 13/8 in the first and got an S+ (we won). Went 13/9 in the second and got an A- (We lost). Both games I was the most damage in the game.
[0:43:41] CrazySzopen: @pepsio joł ona wyprowadza się ?
[0:43:41] itsadamm__: @pepsio dzień dobryy kaypSip
[0:44:00] alinmeiky: riot sucks

[0:44:13] padampadamm: 60% would still be fun for me ngl lol
[0:44:16] padampadamm: haha
[0:44:19] FaeriePunk: Is there any way to check my mmr?
[0:44:26] petaa16: literally they let me climb somewhere and then i cant win unless i drop
[0:44:27] padampadamm: @FaeriePunk nope
[0:44:36] Siempje010: Siempje010 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 101 months! woehoeeee im the 101 doggo xD hahahahhah have a amazing stream :D
[0:44:55] poncho_goblin22: and matchmaking isn’t even close. yesterday I had a masters support and an iron 3 mid laner in a silver game. nobody was duo, it is just what Riot gave us.
[0:45:00] ani671: What if i told you i didnt stop playing cuz of the mmr but cuz of these FUCKIN TOXIC PLAYERS!!! kaypShame kaypShame kaypShame but same girl same. LUL
[0:45:03] heyleo22: hii
[0:45:16] Darkcyter: @Siempje010 101 kaypPog CENTURION kaypCheer WB kaypHYPERS
[0:45:16] eengerman: ive got a friend. we've been same rank 3y in a row. thies season he 3 brackets higher. idk how that happened
[0:45:32] ani671: Thats a whole other rant girlfriend. Lol.
[0:46:10] ani671: Wait...is the 1-0 a win? Did you win that ziggs game?
[0:46:22] Lipp5_: DAMN, i just got here kp
[0:46:25] SykoKing02: i also have the issue that my playstyle is getting my team ahead and not hard carrying myself. so if i get stuck on a team that doesnt have someone good enough to hard carry i just lose
[0:46:31] Lipp5_: how u doiinggg
[0:46:39] TyrTheTiny: riot said "have you tried getting good?"
[0:46:41] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea I agree 100% agree, maybe there's some stuff I could do better but riot does not help the situation at all
[0:46:42] steelkore: kaypFreya kaypFreya
[0:46:58] pepsio: yesterday I lost three games in a row cause of 4 trolls I had , literally three games , every game 15min ,my 4th game ...easy stomp from my team kaypHappea
[0:47:05] ani671: LUCAS!!! WE NEED A COACH!!!!
[0:47:23] lilCACTUSS9: There is just one problem with the mmr system. It completely eliminates the chance that you have improved over the years. Riot thinks that your mmr has evolved over time and is an average of your skill, but what if you have evolved a lot since your account has existed. Can you rly shape your mmr by playing perfectly? Sure. But is it fair? No
[0:47:50] BE_OH_WHY: relax kelsie
[0:48:03] doctor0616: hey Kaypea <3 love you and hope you have a nice weekend ^^
[0:48:05] c0urtneyl0uise: Did I join at the wrong time
[0:48:10] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea riot would tell me that the game I just had could have been won if we simply kill a giga fed draven.
[0:48:12] Flinkehh: The truth is all thats coming through rn
[0:48:17] FaeriePunk: I love your vibe, KayPea!
[0:48:18] TyrTheTiny: YEAHHH WHAT SHE SAID, LET'S GO TO THEIR HEADQUARTERS AND BURN THE BUILDING DOWN kaypRiot
[0:48:24] NightChappy: They also jsaid just go buy a coach
[0:48:26] sami0_0plays: Hiiiii
[0:48:28] Sx10: @faeriepunk me too
[0:48:31] Teekwan: Tho, i honestly didn't find my recent ranked matches toxic, like before i uninstalled i had such nice teammates, and i was in awe when our top lane fed, and yet not a single person was flaming him, not a single person wanted to complain or cry. Btw i installed the damn game again because of your vods, i can't leave that hellhole pls help
[0:48:31] Sx10: 😭😭😭😂
[0:48:34] ani671: Like if we truly thought we needed help, this would be a backseat gaming safe community...but its not the case.
[0:48:35] Rincewurst: kp losing it. after all these years it got to her
[0:48:36] sami0_0plays: How are u today queeen?
[0:48:42] slayingibis: yo
[0:49:00] A8BitShot: I wish rank was hard reset every season
[0:49:23] lilCACTUSS9: There is no complete mmr reset in every season, right?
[0:49:26] layeuna: good evening <3 <3
[0:49:32] petaa16: thank god we have 30 useless bad designed skins in a month but the game is unplayable
[0:49:34] JimmyBigmoney: "win too many games in a short time? must be wrong" *gets -30 lp when losing*
[0:49:35] Smoothcollie: kaypMega Kelsie in the head of w/e shit controlls this system kaypMega
[0:49:37] ericaborgest: @lilCACTUSS9 I dont think so
[0:49:46] slayingibis: thats me - been bronze since season 2 kaypTroll2
[0:49:50] priam0: Hi girl, just roam the strongest lane. On this case, go bot when lillia goes to gank, if possible
[0:49:51] emefleys35: Hı kaypea have fun!
[0:50:02] sabiirox: @A8BitShot like mmr reset every season?
[0:50:02] QTwinkyyy: Hey btw I'm no trying to demoralize you but your Senna has a 39% wr in 79 games @KayPea
[0:50:14] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea it's okay, it's good to let it all out
[0:50:16] lilCACTUSS9: I think people who have worse mmr than their rank should get a full mmr reset, because a lot of the times they proved that they are better than their mmr
[0:50:19] JimmyBigmoney: balance team dont know shit
[0:50:23] FlyingMaster08: Was geht ab 🙌
[0:50:29] Ascht94: We only rant about it because we still love playin it beside the downsides
[0:50:31] priam0: Lillia is your win condition
[0:50:45] ani671: Riot james trying to balance a circle. LUL LUL LUL
[0:51:01] bradboybebop: I have not heard one person say a positive thing about that tweet and I think that is proof enough! that’s all I’ll say
[0:51:07] ericaborgest: let it out my friend kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti kaypLOL kaypCreep
[0:51:12] sabiirox: kp on her daily ranked rant
[0:51:15] lilCACTUSS9: It was a relatable venting
[0:51:28] hvydlphn: the game is fine, the system sucks, i quit because of the community
[0:51:43] alexmexx86: nynyxCute
[0:52:00] slayingibis: hello
[0:52:03] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea now, just gotta type this rant to riot 🤪
[0:52:11] LadySimmie: !followage
[0:52:11] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[0:52:20] sami0_0plays: hiiiiiii
[0:52:45] sabiirox: i got a smolder bot on my team today💀 Then the enemy team had a Ezreal bot lol
[0:52:45] alexmexx86: @LadySimmie nynyxGlow nynyxGlow nynyxGlow
[0:52:47] Wikster650: hii
[0:52:51] lilCACTUSS9: It's not just the game, it's the community, a collective problem that we are all facing, and I'm not saying the solution is so easy, but we have options how the game could be fixed
[0:53:00] sami0_0plays: How are the matches?
[0:53:05] PancakeThePaladin: i agree with this rant and it honestly makes me not want to play
[0:53:12] PancakeThePaladin: cause like...what's the point, ya know?
[0:53:14] JimmyBigmoney: riot dont want you to have too much fun
[0:53:14] HAYB3AR: is there a prediction? did i miss it lol
[0:53:14] fllogel: hellouu, how are u? :D
[0:53:19] slayingibis: kaypTroll2
[0:53:21] Calleson: do u never post going live on twitter kaypea?
[0:53:27] sabiirox: no like they where BOTS not that they were bot lane
[0:53:38] chariotgraw: hii <33
[0:53:40] WayneBretsky: and this is why I have over 5.5k ARAM games :) :) :)
[0:53:45] Wikster650: It's been a while :3
[0:53:48] MizeraHitara: something interesting is also balancing champions, like everyone says that yone is unfair and broken, even mains say it and some riot guys just say "lol skill issue" basically
[0:54:00] ericaborgest: Karma is so broken
[0:54:08] sami0_0plays: Is new luden good?
[0:54:12] ani671: League has become a game i like to watch more than play myself.
[0:54:14] TyrTheTiny: prediction : will riot test our patience or our intelligence? vote now*
[0:54:14] sami0_0plays: With changes
[0:54:20] Smoothcollie: @lilCACTUSS9 As u said, the mmr hard reset could make something tbh But here we are, crying for hard mmr reset for X years kaypAnnoyed
[0:54:26] Niomah: Where can you see how many ARAMs you've played?
[0:54:52] fllogel: <3
[0:55:02] doublemeatpalace: @Niomah after an aram game it'll show wins and losses near top
[0:55:07] kingprime: @Niomah should tell top left after every aram game
[0:55:11] lilCACTUSS9: @Smoothcollie And we will be crying for it for a couple more years
[0:55:14] PegasusMooon: youre gonna watch cblol?
[0:55:23] Wikster650: I'm great! Got my second tatoo yesterday ^^
[0:55:26] ericaborgest: kaypStack kaypStack
[0:55:28] WayneBretsky: it is getting to a pretty rediculous point. Like who in their right mind thought, Malignince wouldn't interact with champs who have low cooldown ults...
[0:55:30] YetiRider115: !newvideo
[0:55:31] Nightbot: ✨ NEW Cho Top video is out! kaypLUL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDGp1GohLgY ✨
[0:55:42] petrivelli: hiii there.. How goes ..
[0:55:44] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea I think riot needs to play the game more against these broken matchups to experience it themselves then they'll understand.
[0:56:09] pixmelulu: then she builds cdr boot and other cdr items
[0:56:20] pixmelulu: and her ult is like ok no cooldown
[0:56:27] WayneBretsky: I see this happen over and over and over again in corporate america. The business owners/decision makers are so disconnected from their customers/products
[0:56:32] coffeecrisp01: I used to play ziggs, but this season he felt so weak :( is it in my head ?
[0:56:37] Niomah: I'll have to look next time
[0:56:40] pixmelulu: in 8-10 seconds team fight she can get off 3 mantras
[0:56:41] MizeraHitara: which item are we talking about? can you show it? dont have the new names memorized yet
[0:56:42] ericaborgest: @coffeecrisp01 I feel the same
[0:56:46] JimmyBigmoney: riot employees just play aram
[0:56:54] JimmyBigmoney: and are like gold max
[0:56:54] sami0_0plays: Is ziggs good pick rn?
[0:56:58] priam0: You should roam bot at this point. Push fast the cannon wave and roam bot 🥳
[0:57:02] sabiirox: anyone be getting alot of bots in their games lately? i have had 4 bots in my last 6games
[0:57:06] Rincewurst: @league_of_d3pression will they ever get to the amount of games as average players?
[0:57:09] TyrTheTiny: riot employees just play candy crush
[0:57:19] ericaborgest: @priam0 no back sitting friend kaypComfy kaypComfy
[0:57:29] kingprime: @sabiirox how do you determine whether its a bot or a bad player?
[0:57:29] ericaborgest: seating*
[0:57:40] JimmyBigmoney: i've seen riot balancing team employees being bronze
[0:57:46] thelunarqueen666: balance team is already biased against jg.. and idk if still holds up, butthe balance team leader is an adc main
[0:57:50] sovitiaisavampire: that w was sweet
[0:57:53] Jun848: i started losing randomly bc of matchmaking and just went on loser's queue after that
[0:57:53] dalig_: hello daligSweet
[0:58:06] Jun848: they really need to fix matchmaking
[0:58:12] MizeraHitara: the layoffs where mostly writers as far as im aware, one wrote stories/lore for so many champs and they just layed him off
[0:58:26] darjar12: hii
[0:58:49] Smoothcollie: Ok so karma with malignence at lvl 6 R CD - 20 sec. When she hits you with emprowed Q, it gets to 15, when it explodes it gets to 10 sec cd. And ofc, W  and AAs lower the cd as well. So. Ye
[0:58:53] watermeelon_juice: hi it’s su just changed the name to sth more fun >< luxxDance luxxDance
[0:58:54] c0urtneyl0uise: I uninstalled league for the first time ever after playing about 10 games this season, it just made me so unhappy whilst playing
[0:58:54] darjar12: oh i missed an hour
[0:59:06] sabiirox: @kingprime you can see it on how they moveand play, and im in emerald/plat lobbies so its pretty obvious
[0:59:15] ericaborgest: uh oh
[0:59:15] Niomah: Right now anyone whose R isn't a shift change and who don't use Mana benefits insanely from the haste and 600 Mana from Malignance
[0:59:22] Mayveda: @Smoothcollie AAs dont lower the cd of ultimate since like a year babe
[0:59:38] Rincewurst: wait you dont get a stack when you only damage shield?
[0:59:39] Scarletyy: there's 1 ziggs skin that makes her W so hard to dodge
[0:59:44] Lolitavlr: Hi, I'm from Brazil, I follow you on YouTube. I'm a big fan of your gameplay. sashhaCorazon sashhaPirulitinho
[0:59:47] Smoothcollie: @Mayveda Dont they? Damn, mb Sadge
[0:59:49] QTwinkyyy: Sorry to repeat this but your Senna has a 39% wr in 79 games... RIOT!!! @KayPea
[0:59:53] kingprime: @sabiirox I dont think thats enough to identify a bot
[1:00:13] Mayveda: @Smoothcollie You're fine dear
[1:00:25] sabiirox: im in plat rn
[1:00:39] Niomah: Yeah in ARAM I did 105K damage on a Karma with Malignance because if I hit my Qs and Ws my ult was up ALL THE TIME
[1:00:40] meep_: @Rincewurst Nope, you have to damage the actual champion
[1:00:47] sami0_0plays: Is luden good on ziggs?
[1:00:57] JustCaptainMimmy: Hello Kels how is your day Happy Sunday kaypH5 kaypLove kaypFlower kaypCozy
[1:01:29] GunzaPrime: i think i know why the enemy botlane is 7-0
[1:01:32] JustCaptainMimmy: the new video its so fun kaypLove kaypLove
[1:01:43] Rincewurst: @meep_ neat! I like that
[1:01:48] Scarletyy: lillia???
[1:01:48] Niomah: @sami0_0plays  Ludens is good if you need poke and if you Auto attack, and Ziggs autoattacks because of his passive
[1:01:51] pixmelulu: that was 4 mantras
[1:01:51] MizeraHitara: ok did a quick google search, mostly artist like concept artist, sound designer and writers got laid off. Some game producers but mostly the creative field if im reading this correctly
[1:01:54] NightChappy: Have you tried working on yourself Kappa
[1:02:15] QTwinkyyy: honestly though with this matchmaking I'm impressed you don't rant like every game

[1:02:45] Scarletyy: burnt toast theory
[1:03:03] priam0: Lillia should gank more often i guess
[1:03:04] Jun848: i got to plat so quick on my ult and it took month on my main
[1:03:10] Jun848: ridonculous
[1:03:17] sami0_0plays: Is  luden better than the seraph ?
[1:03:28] MizeraHitara: as a high gold low plat girly getting told that games with me are so much harder by a diamond player says something, in the sense that his games are not as hard as mine are
[1:03:43] SnYpingNinja: hi KP
[1:03:45] lilCACTUSS9: @Jun848 Same here, with my friends account that he doesn't use anymore
[1:03:50] SnYpingNinja: how r u
[1:03:53] Scarletyy: at least you can win this game by splitpushing with ziggs
[1:04:26] Niomah: @sami0_0plays It has similar haste, a touch less AP, but it gives 600 mana right off and has the static shivvy thing that goes off every 3 seconds
[1:04:29] kristykat_: kaypArrive kaypHello
[1:04:31] sabiirox: @jun848 literally
[1:04:39] Scarletyy: emerald is a nightmare to most people
[1:04:59] MizeraHitara: emerald is a troll fest im told
[1:05:00] petaa16: ive heard gold is the worst
[1:05:08] sami0_0plays: @niomah Ojhh
[1:05:13] sami0_0plays: Nice
[1:05:15] TyrTheTiny: that karma is so pretty
[1:05:18] Niomah: Emerald feels like a gate-keeping device by emerald to hold as many people back from diamond as possible
[1:05:24] Niomah: by Riot rather
[1:05:27] petaa16: i see
[1:05:29] paksmen: it is
[1:05:35] paksmen: strugling rn
[1:05:36] QTwinkyyy: Yeah I'm in emerald and I refuse  to play without a duo because as a support main I need someone to rely on
[1:05:43] Elqor: wow that Kayle skin looks nice
[1:05:54] ani671: So you know how you said working on your cs helped you get to emerald? Maybe this is the elo where everyones macro is on par with yours.
[1:05:54] kingprime: Im playing Emerald duoq with a friend of mine whos Master on his main and honestly sometimes all we can do is try to laugh about what my team(and me) are doing as he points it out :D
[1:06:25] ani671: Like theyre not sure whats the next move.
[1:06:30] yepein99: Hi kay lets just chill

[1:42:21] ericaborgest: @Dumbmuto you changed your name?? D: hi fammm
[1:42:28] YamiCF: LESS GO!!
[1:42:39] Niomah: Welp won my ARAM on Karthus but dodged the second because NO ONE would use a reroll for me and I was not gonna try to be a first time Yasuo or Darius
[1:42:41] Dumbmuto: FeelsDankMan I got danker
[1:42:43] Niomah: I don't do melee champs
[1:42:48] Niomah: I have old lady reflexes.
[1:42:56] Dumbmuto: @lewhitehd69 plink
[1:42:57] lewhitehd69: FeelsDankMan Clap chills
[1:43:00] jimbob_ywert: @feedthetank That’s true. tried to become a jungle main but the immense responsibility with it just made me go back to mid
[1:43:00] Dumbmuto: @ericaborgest hiii
[1:43:07] YamiCF: totally didn’t think that you were gonna die in a 3v2!!
[1:43:07] FiveFM: Dammit, it looked like you'd dodged that. Briar ult be wide.
[1:43:13] jimbob_ywert: you just gotta love Bard mains
[1:43:16] guiltyprawn: An average bard player
[1:43:20] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea that bard is a real one for taking vex down there

[1:43:26] Dumbmuto: PepeLmao let's say this dumbo didn't know you can only change once in every 6 months
[1:43:37] lewhitehd69: KEKL
[1:43:39] FeedTheTank: @jimbob_ywert exactly, easier to play your champ in mid, and carry and make the team play around you :D
[1:43:40] srhttmr: evaizmDance evaizmDance evaizmDance evaizmDance evaizmDance evaizmWtf evaizmWtf evaizmWtf evaizmWtf
[1:43:59] QTwinkyyy: I guess Malignance could work with her fear but who knows
[1:44:01] Niomah: I can't understand people refusing to use rerolls as if not having an extra in their pocket is more likely to be an issue than someone on their team being on a champ they literally cannot play
[1:44:04] blondieforlife: im fast as fuck boiiiiiiiiiii
[1:44:13] P4zzie: greeeeetings EUW Kaypea
[1:44:26] kellz30: Bard said with these support items I'm gonna carry whole team
[1:44:39] P4zzie: amazon stopped trippin ballz the moment they received money, they said "oh prime is not available in your country"
[1:44:43] Niomah: Bard is pretty scary with the support item
[1:44:47] iBexi: Bad thing for vex is that she's been overly cautious which is costing her some kills
[1:44:56] VanillaEssenceLoL: how are the games going?
[1:45:05] Smoothcollie: I HATE how briar can jump over walls with that spell kaypUpsetti
[1:45:11] FeedTheTank: Good luck next time @KayPea
[1:45:26] Niomah: @Smoothcollie Her scream gives me the heebie jeebies
[1:45:38] ericaborgest: does smite do damage to champions?
[1:45:53] Niomah: I think one of the smites does
[1:45:53] FeedTheTank: @ericaborgest yes, but not alot.
[1:45:59] Niomah: There are diff ones or used to be
[1:46:06] Niomah: I only ARAM now
[1:46:24] jimbob_ywert: was a really good play but unfortunate
[1:46:35] kellz30: Aram is the best mode
[1:46:42] Niomah: #truth
[1:46:43] kellz30: 😁
[1:46:45] jimbob_ywert: @feedthetank let’s hope I can carry mid kaypVibe
[1:46:56] Niomah: @kellz30 I turn all chat off and just enjoy myself
[1:47:08] kellz30: Same lol
[1:47:21] guiltyprawn: Skayling
[1:47:39] isabelle_vianna: hi @KayPea
[1:47:53] Niomah: Its 24 to 13 wtf would you FF?
[1:48:02] Niomah: because SHE isn't carrying?
[1:48:27] Smoothcollie: kaypVibe kaypVibe kaypVibe
[1:48:30] MrsBeebles: Played an urf yesterday and the enemy senna kept saying "sit or sit dog" after every kill she got, kinda awkward to be honest
[1:48:39] Rincewurst: garen ult?
[1:48:43] Calamora: garen also
[1:48:44] TheHikuro: TheHikuro subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 51 months! holaaa ;)
[1:48:45] QTwinkyyy: Garen also ulted I'm pretty sure!
[1:48:47] Niomah: Oh
[1:48:50] Niomah: Well that is just rude
[1:48:56] kellz30: That moment u like I have a team, but where
[1:49:02] kellz30: 😮‍💨
[1:49:20] bombsnb: then they end up losing … too cocky I trust in you !!
[1:49:28] ericaborgest: pepeJAM
[1:49:28] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea when you get cocky in all chat it always goes bad
[1:49:38] Darkcyter: @TheHikuro 51 kaypHYPERS WB
[1:49:40] luminosity_light: You doing that is gonna bring focus to you. They just gonna focus extra hard on the vayne to prove her wrong and that can ruin a game
[1:49:44] luminosity_light: *her
[1:50:03] FiveFM: I appreciate it when the other team is CLEARLY gonna lose but they let you style on them and kill the Nexus whilst still putting up a token fight. (Because it so rarely happens to me cause I suck).
[1:50:08] bombsnb: i just shut up and try and win without getting picked down
[1:50:15] Niomah: That's such a Vayne player thing to do too
[1:50:40] FiveFM: drat
[1:50:53] TurtleIam: well Vanye jinxed it
[1:50:57] TurtleIam: LUL
[1:51:08] jimbob_ywert: Bard has to peel Kaylee
[1:51:45] kellz30: 2020Snacking
[1:51:59] Elqor: is Bard ever going to get a good skin
[1:52:02] iBexi: People dont have the mental and willpower like others do. Even when it looks bad, it could always turn around in an instant.
[1:52:20] jimbob_ywert: @elqor is this supposed to be satire kaypShame
[1:52:22] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea that was too accurate it’s scary 🤣
[1:52:24] kellz30: Bard better grab some more support items
[1:52:38] jimbob_ywert: Every bard skin is good, especially winter bard and and shen hai
[1:53:21] Elqor: @jimbob_ywert I like this Bards skin, but  the others look awkward
[1:53:22] Niomah: I love the winter bard one. The hot cocoa health packs are adorable
[1:53:35] 1234sacha: hello hello
[1:53:37] Elqor: Asto Bard looks weird with that green hue
[1:53:51] ericaborgest: briar damage disgusting
[1:53:52] shedfirekid1: briar becoming a problem
[1:54:08] jimbob_ywert: @elqor Sure Bard Bard is boring, Astronaut bard is a little wonky, but elderwoof and cafe cuties bard are really good skins as well
[1:54:22] Elqor: True Winter Bard looks nice, but thats like the only one. Cupcake  Bard has the most ugliest in game model have seen
[1:54:24] Jaguar542: Are we winning today? LuvHearts
[1:54:31] iBexi: Good stuff, Kaypea. nickiCute
[1:54:42] Niomah: this skin is cute too
[1:54:45] Niomah: The meeps for it are adorable
[1:54:58] Elqor: @jimbob_ywert Cupcake looks good as a picturee in the loading screen, but in game looks terrible honestly, have you seen the entire model
[1:55:27] Elqor: ah Elderwood I forgot about that one, that one is good
[1:55:28] christianfr9: Good evening
[1:55:34] sovitiaisavampire: HOW

[1:55:52] XRedmartyrX: thing was low for so long
[1:55:56] meraryDyb: OMG
[1:56:11] Rincewurst: both probably had smite but both were in bard ult. better apm wins xD
[1:56:54] Rincewurst: you were at their front door, what did you expect? xD
[1:56:55] TurtleIam: you were pushed up by yourself
[1:57:35] shedfirekid1: wet noodle fight in the bot lane there
[1:57:45] teamyyyyyyyyy: !EU
[1:57:46] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[1:57:59] STYL3SH33T: @Rincewurst apm is for kids
[1:58:01] Jaguar542: Their base is through the front door?
[1:58:11] Rincewurst: well front door is an exaggeration but t2 turret is kinda far ^^ but I see where you wouldve expected them
[1:58:18] teamyyyyyyyyy: ahhh i was thinking you moved to EU with lucas but wasn't sure
[1:59:02] Rincewurst: uwu
[1:59:13] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea we always go deep to show dominance 🤣
[1:59:48] MaasawDreamt: sneakyHey
[2:00:11] Rincewurst: wtf was that flying across the screen?

[2:03:15] Tyreane: Hello beautiful chat
[2:03:19] jimbob_ywert: Ironic how kayle saved you from her own sword (garens ult is Kayles power lol)
[2:03:23] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea in wild rift you can honour multiple people, idk why you can’t do that on pc
[2:03:35] XRedmartyrX: Yea, its going to be more performance based instead of just win or lose lp gains
[2:03:39] Danydouu: i remember when you oculd also honor ennemies
[2:03:42] iBexi: No lol I meant what was her kill count
[2:03:45] FiveFM: Not upset
[2:03:48] jimbob_ywert: NOOO
[2:04:04] Tyreane: My Sunday is going fantastic, thank you!

[2:04:41] TomNova: i believe
[2:04:48] Danydouu: try? WIN again*
[2:05:07] FeedTheTank: @KayPea in Overwatch you can honor even your enemies, if you like them, but not your premadess.
[2:05:08] ani671: Did you ever play McDonald's lux for the one dweller friendo?
[2:05:27] NOMOREftw: !followage

[2:07:07] idckdolphins: For a second I thought the toy on the ground was Freya kaypFreya
[2:07:33] shedfirekid1: what I'm hearing is that league has always been toxic
[2:07:36] Hamochakita: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[2:07:50] TomNova: it is unfortunate that we cant have nice things cause of dumb people
[2:07:51] Hamochakita: yeah i remember that
[2:07:51] idckdolphins: tbh, honoring for example the enemy top because he was better than me and he played brilliantly would be so cool
[2:07:58] shedfirekid1: yeah I miss seasons 3-6
[2:08:16] jimbob_ywert: Playing your main champ > meta slaves
[2:08:18] idckdolphins: well.. remember the bait ping? xd
[2:08:32] NOMOREftw: In 4 days it will be 9 years since I started following you.Time goes by so fast :(
[2:08:34] RainbowUnicornTwitch: I remember the first time i got proxied by a singed piripuSad  that was something
[2:08:43] FeedTheTank: people are just grinding honors nowadays to show off :D
[2:09:02] TomNova: i hate that people are toxic for you trying to play a thing in a video game
[2:09:03] ericaborgest: seems like the game was fun back in the day
[2:09:07] Hamochakita: did u win last game ? i went afk for a min
[2:09:26] Hamochakita: pls tell me that vayne didnt jinx you
[2:09:34] TorqueBandit: People were honoring trolling enemy team?... do they not realize that could make that person possibly on their team next time?... >_>
[2:09:36] flacsmada: asol swings games so hard right now in almost all elo's
[2:09:47] Mr_Noissy: holaa
[2:09:54] TorqueBandit: because they would be less likely banned for honors i assume
[2:09:55] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea I’m like that rn, at work constantly thinking about a wacky kog maw build I’m gonna try at home 🤣
[2:10:04] Danydouu: same... and now i barely play
[2:10:08] FeedTheTank: @flacsmada that is due to him being more proactive now, instead of just afk farming under tower
[2:10:09] jimbob_ywert: I miss when I’d wait for every Tuesday to see the “free champ” rotation and try new champs! it’s when I would barely get BE to buy champs lol
[2:10:10] HuskiesSymphony: I've gotten to a point where I'll only try new stuff with my duo lol
[2:10:10] shedfirekid1: i remember grinding bot games because intermediate bots were hard.... and just trying out new champs/builds
[2:10:11] jqvannaa: hellooo
[2:10:11] jimbob_ywert: miss that feeling

[2:11:47] TorqueBandit: @ani671 it's a good question.
[2:11:54] FrostySupreem: but Not STINKIER ENOUGH
[2:11:56] TomNova: i have corporate mundo as a shard, was debating unlocking it LUL @league_of_d3pression

[2:12:22] AflamingN00B: Good evening feeders HeyGuys
[2:12:23] shedfirekid1: predictions should be how soon will someone be toxic? 1 min, 2 mins, or champ select
[2:12:23] league_of_d3pression: @tomnova never debate, just do it. corporate mundo is a great skin 🤣
[2:12:27] flacsmada: hate to say it but id have to bet on other team, they have a strong comp
[2:12:33] Danydouu: is mundo mundo really mundo as a prediction ?
[2:12:44] lewhitehd69: Pog got cannon
[2:12:49] moonlightaurelia: How have games been today?
[2:12:52] TorqueBandit: i thought the skin was "totally not mundo"? Or is that another champ

[2:14:18] FeedTheTank: if you ran straight
[2:14:32] Sahmiran: you need to wait a little then flash to break noc scare if im not mistaken
[2:14:42] arclyann: Why I cant get over with Ellie Goulding - Love me like you do song
[2:14:42] Sahmiran: insta flashing does not break it either
[2:15:09] FrostySupreem: His leash is meant to catch up to you

[2:18:42] FeedTheTank: asol's buff was made to make hm more proactive in lane and not afk farming under tower
[2:18:55] Ryance: 1 death per minute lol
[2:19:03] flacsmada: my bet was on other team even though im rooting for you lol
[2:19:21] TorqueBandit: streamer benefits
[2:19:23] ericaborgest: uh oh
[2:19:35] Cybrixz: love me some winners que
[2:19:44] Yuukily: That twitter post made me mald.. lmaoo
[2:19:54] Cybrixz: lol
[2:19:54] adnanmyname: On a fresh account lvl28 of playing mostly revin... And I can't wait to make some enemies in ranked "foe or ally" kinda 50/50 GlitchNRG
[2:20:14] hannah2125: nice survival
[2:20:20] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea you’re 0/2 but still slaying in the rift, you’re time to shine will come 😅
[2:20:22] jimbob_ywert: what twitter post.#
[2:20:23] Omicroad: Yeah that post was total bs
[2:20:31] sovitiaisavampire: what post
[2:20:44] Yuukily: LMAO
[2:20:49] Yuukily: its delulu to the max
[2:20:57] rishkey_: oh yea that made me LOL
[2:21:23] Omicroad: LUL
[2:21:25] Yuukily: i almost wrote a reply but i literally just didnt cuz nah.. im not gonna fight my way in the comments
[2:21:34] Cybrixz: that's the reason my match history is like 4 wins then 4 losses almost all the time
[2:21:37] TomNova: definitely not ... once you lose one game, your next games are filled with people who rage or int or dont try to win
[2:21:49] jimbob_ywert: Keep you stuck in lower elo = Get more addicted and dedicated to climbing out of it = More time put into playing = The cycle restarts
[2:22:02] flacsmada: thats 100 percent not true, ill have 6 or 7 games in a row as jungle where all of my lanes feed by 5 min, then some times ill get 3-4 games where no matter what i do we win
[2:22:26] Hamochakita: so playing vs 4 masters and golds with me in normal games is normal xd
[2:22:28] Hamochakita: funn
[2:22:55] Omicroad: Even games are so rare nowadays imo
[2:23:00] Yuukily: When they said " if a higher Rank person would review ur game would tell you a way to win the game " the same high elo players who FF at 15 80% of the time ?
[2:23:01] rishkey_: yea for me my top laner usually turbo feeds enemy tank bruiser making it unplayable for mage/adc :/
[2:23:20] jimbob_ywert: But I do believe that in the span of 100 games, your rank is where you belong like I don’t believe anyone is going to forever be hard stuck or just have the problem of their teammates all the time
[2:23:28] ani671: If losers queue isnt a thing, then why are there LITERAL BOTS playing in low elo ranked games???
[2:23:29] TomNova: its always one way or the other, never balanced
[2:23:32] Jaguar542: Yea! Show them we mages are not fooling around anymore, blast them with a shotgun! kaypUpsetti
[2:23:34] markella_andri: caino?
[2:23:45] Omicroad: So true
[2:24:00] nezha_00: yeah it feels like there is no back and forth which is lame, as much as I hate to admit it it makes me understand the "ff" mentality
[2:24:18] Casyo99: my last game we were 4silver1 gold(me) vs 4 golds 1 silver ...
[2:24:25] Zohrooo: LIES
[2:24:33] Ecak01: Just remove skirmishes and tanks LUL
[2:24:39] flacsmada: ya, and usually its like a dar or sett top lane that you just cant kill after they are fed
[2:24:42] FeedTheTank: @KayPea the games nowadays have are so messed up that you have to try 120% every. single. game. if you wanna win
[2:24:48] Yuukily: I think the main issue last split and this season is people who are typing like its club penguin and tilting so easily and not wanting to play
[2:24:51] Ecak01: skirmishers*
[2:25:03] lilCACTUSS9: Same here. Somehow it's always the top laner in my games. Either feeds like hell in the first 10 minutes and then balmes the jungler for not helping, as if the jungler had the chance to gank OR they randomly disconnect and the game is lost even though we had had great chances to win, 4v5 is just almost impossible
[2:25:05] adnanmyname: Get good 4head
[2:25:16] ShogunKitten: i had to unistall recently because i had a string of 3 games at a plat1 gettin silvers and bronze on my team...
[2:25:19] LilithHeleno: LilithHeleno subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 10 month streak! <3
[2:25:27] FiveFM: kaypVibe
[2:25:33] STYL3SH33T: i personaly think first of all the pro gamer should get better
[2:25:35] TomNova: sometimes you can literally play amazingly, dont feed, whatever, and still get matched with 4 bots
[2:25:35] rishkey_: whoever tweeted that probably doesnt play the game loll
[2:25:50] jimbob_ywert: If you play better than the rank you deserve EVENTUALLY you will get the rank you deserve, even tho you can be hard stuck a lot of the times ofc. I think this is proven by just the drastic skill difference you see in like diamond 1 games compared to Gold
[2:25:51] STYL3SH33T: ups i forgot the  Kappa
[2:26:02] Darkcyter: @LilithHeleno WB
[2:26:03] ShogunKitten: Saving my mental for when something is fixed cause this aint it LMAO
[2:26:08] Zohrooo: I'm 90% sure I'm in a loser queue on my main. I'm a plat and also had a bronze top and 2 silver while the enemy had 3 gold and 2 plat...literally doesn't make sense
[2:26:15] hannah2125: i would play league again if it was actually balanced and not toxic
[2:26:35] oatsquaress: yea if u actually deserve the rank u will eventually climb there
[2:26:43] flacsmada: @Zohrooo im a d2 jg on my main, and cant get out of silver on my alt... it depresses me, been in silver for a month trying to get out
[2:26:47] Yuukily: Kaypea i got a game where i was clearing a wave to take a tower and i took a cannon. my twitch malded cuz i took the cannon. He ran it down 3/13 .. CUZ OF A CANNON GIRL.. like what the fuck
[2:26:53] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea just get good, duhhhhhhh
[2:27:03] jimbob_ywert: That 13 loss streak then going on a 9 game win streak after was so funny
[2:27:14] TomNova: no no, obviouslyyyy you're the problem, definitely (sarcasm) LUL
[2:27:26] versatile18: kaypCheer
[2:27:36] Zohrooo: @flacsmada disgusting T_T I feel like there's also a lot of new players in ranked that should be starting bronze and are placed gold for their first games...it doesn't make sense
[2:27:38] adnanmyname: Ya the matchmaking doesn't make sense... I had a game a silver... I swear I played a game that had plat, gold and bronze.... And that's after the update where they said they gonna fix that LUL
[2:27:51] FeedTheTank: @flacsmada same tihng for me, i am gold 4 on my alt, and dia 4 on my main, and i can't get out, cause all games have low bronze and the occasional silvers.
[2:27:53] rishkey_: I remember when we were able to look up our actual MMR
[2:28:10] Omicroad: 0/14 team while you died 0 times and did your best to cs, obviously a you diff according to riot
[2:28:23] mrry2k: with how little personal skill and gameplay matters in league it actually amazes me people can reach such insane elo
[2:28:30] ShogunKitten: @Yuukily As a supp main this hurts every time... like sometimes it happens, chill!
[2:28:35] Omicroad: Just "get better" LUL
[2:28:45] nezha_00: is this "true skill" supposed to address this at all or is it just gonna be the same/worse?
[2:28:46] HuskiesSymphony: but them saying no games are match made against you? Thats wild
[2:28:56] makrem_mrabet: the only thing that im sure about that the players riot bring to ur loby in ur team each game is not really fair
[2:29:03] Ecak01: Gosh once I was playing brand support, obviously sometimes you take some CS, my ADC decided to go afk in fountain after 10 minutes because "I was taking all farm" (i had like 20 tops)
[2:29:20] Yuukily: i was 80% WR 40 games and when i was like i think 3 games from diamond i lost and in 2 weeks i went from 80% to 54% WR in 130 Games, were climbing back though
[2:29:25] adnanmyname: A way to go around the forced 50/50 in Dota.. Is to add the griefers and Q at the same time... The game just doesn't like to match u with friends for some reason LUL
[2:29:30] flacsmada: @FeedTheTank ya i really cant get out of silver playing the same as i do in diamond because i cant be a team player, i have to be selfish, but the biggest issue is me knowing that if i try to drag, their team sends 2-3 to contest while i have 2 lanes afking... that happens more than half the time
[2:29:53] solitigre: riot has a well tuned machine to get players to keep coming back chasing that win. tho, if everyone was a winner, no one would play
[2:30:39] ani671: Plus, when you do reeeally good plays that change the game in your favor, that high you get is addicting.
[2:30:40] league_of_d3pression: @ecak01 yeah, some people are stupid af. I played seraphine supp the enemy was poking us so I deceived to poke back and took 1 minion as a result. the kaisa decided to afk…this was 2 mins into the game.
[2:30:47] FeedTheTank: @flacsmada that's why i try and carry games as a mid main, but even if i have 20+ kills, my team is just like, "why take all kills if you can't carry?" i mean if they go 2/15 it's kinda difficult
[2:30:52] flacsmada: @solitigre i believe it, i think riot breeds frustration and toxicity but that gets people negatively addicted(like a bad relationship) then gaslights you
[2:30:55] solitigre: that said I still like to play win or lose 😅
[2:31:06] Yuukily: there used to be a site for MMR but riot forced the person who made it to remove it.
[2:31:31] ObsceneSanity: ive been watching a lot of High elo streams and the matchmaking seems like a real mess
[2:31:34] Omicroad: So many losses being outside of your control is frustratingg
[2:31:34] flacsmada: @FeedTheTank yup and as a jg playing with silver players, they dont understand me not 1v3'in an objective or not sitting on a pushed lane that is 0 and 10
[2:31:44] rishkey_: yeah that tweet shouldve stayed in the drafts xD
[2:32:01] FeedTheTank: @flacsmada low elo bro, it gives me a headache sometmes
[2:33:02] flacsmada: @FeedTheTank honestly ive been doing better just snowballing myself early and avoiding team fights unless i see my team working together or listening to calls
[2:33:40] Ketsuuri: what tweet? im out of the loop
[2:33:48] TequiilaMockiingBiird: TequiilaMockiingBiird subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:33:49] jimbob_ywert: that’s definitely why ranked is only duos max (other than flex, but that’s not important) it’s part of their matchmaking strategy. also duos aren’t even allowed after masters
[2:34:00] Yuukily: WAIT THEY DELETED THE TWEET
[2:34:02] Yuukily: LMAOOO
[2:34:06] Jaguar542: But I am delusional, If my top goes 0-10 in lane, it must be my fault as a mid laner 4HEAD
[2:34:14] DeepInCryo: tell us you don't understand the internet without telling us you don't understand the internet
[2:34:17] solitigre: pro play live patch has been great so far, fun to watch
[2:34:28] FeedTheTank: @flacsmada yup, same, i ahd a time where we aced them and got the mid inhib, and could end the game, but my team wanted baron? like why??? just end...
[2:34:29] Omicroad: That tweet was a slap in the face haha
[2:34:33] Hamochakita: just type karthus ult?
[2:34:41] flacsmada: @jimbob_ywert true, if i want to save a headache i just only duo low elo... also i didnt know duo was banned after masters(prob cuz im hard stuck d2)
[2:34:58] Vencut: whats wrong with that
[2:35:05] AliceInAmyLand: the tweet saying losers queue isn't a thing?
[2:35:06] Yuukily: I CANT FIND IT
[2:35:09] Ecak01: Her auto attack probably connected while you were in range still
[2:35:10] ObsceneSanity: are you talking about the loser queue tweet from Phroxzon?
[2:35:12] iCortexz: wtf is that damge
[2:35:21] Yuukily: can you link it ?
[2:35:24] Yuukily: AM I CRAZY
[2:35:30] romsteak2174: hii bonjour
[2:35:34] league_of_d3pression: she has a lot of stacks and collector, it’s tough @kaypea
[2:35:35] AliceInAmyLand: I mean that's true
[2:35:36] Vencut: i mean thats not THAT bad
[2:35:41] jimbob_ywert: maybe hes just new and riot isn’t telling him everything kaypLOL
[2:35:50] DeepInCryo: they sent out the april fools tweet a couple months early
[2:35:56] Vencut: no what you said
[2:35:56] flacsmada: @FeedTheTank or we wipe their team, and cant end yet, and team wont ever do baron, so we just sit there for 20 minutes when we could have done baron and pushed inhibs... or if my team does when, push an inhib but wont reset, so they stay pushed until enemy comes back and all get wiped
[2:35:58] lilCACTUSS9: Ofc when it's phrased like this "against you" they can say it's not a thing. I doubt they could say the same if you asked Do you matchmake games based on win / lose streaks?
[2:35:58] Ecak01: THEY'RE not doing it, the algorithm is LUL Keepo
[2:36:02] Vencut: just what you said
[2:36:04] HelloOctoberly: I spent 2 seasons grinding like crazy to get my account to gold . This season its back hardstuck bronze. The only answer is I have to make a new account every season and I cannot buy any more skins again. LUL Played yourself riot.
[2:36:09] KayPea: https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1756511358571643286
[2:36:14] Diegoreaper_75: But isnt that what matchmaking is? Sorry if im wrong
[2:36:16] tigerceza: Hey KayPea kaypHello kaypLove  How are u today? kaypCheer
[2:36:22] Yuukily: omg i am crazy
[2:36:37] hey_m31: not only losers q, but the fact that your 10 year old account can be stuck in like gold/plat because of the extremely fucked mmr but a new acc can get to dia in like 100 games
[2:36:51] FeedTheTank: @flacsmada i love low elo, how insanely stupid some people are and just can't use more thna 2 braincells at a time :D
[2:36:52] sovitiaisavampire: every time i open twitter and its KP's account i lose braincells
[2:36:54] solitigre: Sol smash
[2:36:54] flacsmada: @HelloOctoberly ya but then it takes a month to grind a new acc to 30
[2:36:57] ObsceneSanity: The fact that a riot employee has the balls to say " investing in a good coach/asking reputable people for advice will help make your relationship with League a lot better" is insane to me
[2:36:59] sovitiaisavampire: its not KPs*
[2:37:05] Yuukily: the " I promise you that if a good player reviews your games there's 100's of things that you could have done differently "  that sent me LMAO
[2:37:05] sovitiaisavampire: sorry lol
[2:37:08] lilCACTUSS9: @hey_m31 Exactly. Hard reset mmrs every season period
[2:37:09] solitigre: lol^
[2:37:12] HelloOctoberly: @hey_m31 yup. New account, 1st placement game is Gold 1. Old account Bronzeeee
[2:37:39] sovitiaisavampire: i read that twitter and my brain cells cringed
[2:37:44] ObsceneSanity: riot take : You suck bc you didnt pay for coaching.
[2:37:57] guiltyprawn: Well, your first game today was in a team full of Plat 1's vs all Em4's. It was a win but still monkaHmm
[2:38:00] Yuukily: we all make mistakes but thats not a " ask a higher elo person to review ur lost games "
[2:38:01] Yuukily: LMAO
[2:38:03] FiveFM: ... but at the same time they want to maintain an approx 50% win-rate for all players?! Uuuh so they're just dodging the truth. The don't have an actual losers queue ... yeah exactly what you said.
[2:38:04] FeedTheTank: @KayPea i played on my sister's league acc right? she never plays league as she is a valorant player, but after the 5 promos, she got plat 2, like how?????
[2:38:17] solitigre: uncle Rito mad at me cause I don’t pay for skins
[2:38:24] flacsmada: @lilCACTUSS9 this would fix alot actually, or else riot would have to determine elo based on player perfermance and not win/lose
[2:38:25] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea maybe riot should pay for us to get this coaching we apparently so badly need
[2:38:32] mrkukubirdies: this chroma is so hot
[2:38:32] alinmeiky: just created a new account, hopefully the matchmaking is doing me good this time :)))) after hiting lv 30 ofc
[2:38:40] lilCACTUSS9: leave my win streak alone! Let me be happy for more than 3 games
[2:38:42] DeepInCryo: Players: "hey, can we do something about matchmaking?"  Riot: "Haha, get gud noob"
[2:38:43] dylanship: I don’t think they intend to make people lose, they just don’t want to fix their mistake
[2:38:48] rishkey_: its so truee can be on win streak then riot curses you with a troll that wants to afk o run it down mid literally
[2:39:04] idckdolphins: @alinmeiky I created a new account, after 2 years trying to get to gold. Within idk... 10-15 games, I'm gold 3 :)
[2:39:14] Xadiel: This is just a problem with a win/loss mmr that takes no personal skill into account. Some people get carried into ranks based on luck and then you get stuck with them in your game.
[2:39:32] Yuukily: I went on a decently bad Win Loss win loss amount of games and im now just starting to climb back up.. shit is so fucking crazy
[2:39:33] lewhitehd69: why didnt asol R do the big circle thingy? does someone have to be in it for it to happend?
[2:39:48] Zohrooo: I'm lowkey gonna keep playing and see where this loser queue brings me. >:)
[2:39:48] TwiWilkes: @lewhitehd69 it needs to stack first
[2:39:49] FeedTheTank: @lewhitehd69 not enough stacks on it
[2:39:51] alinmeiky: @idckdolphins Yaaaay kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer kaypCheer
[2:39:58] Zohrooo: I kinda wanna see my main account on bronze elo, that would be funny
[2:40:06] Yuukily: @lewhitehd69 he gets a mega ult at a certain point
[2:40:11] lewhitehd69: @TwiWilkes didnt it do the git circle before at the bluebuff? kaypNoted mby i remember wrong
[2:40:18] solitigre: honestly, I can complain about losing, but I don’t play 12 games a week. most is like 5 games a month.
[2:40:19] lewhitehd69: big*
[2:40:30] flacsmada: @KayPea na they had a solid comp, and you guys dropped behind early, not much to do
[2:40:32] Azmod3ous: Riot tilted you with the matchmaking tweet to affect your mental :D
[2:40:34] nicorasenpai: zeri and maokai are having a hard time in rell and senna
[2:40:37] idckdolphins: GGs
[2:40:49] solitigre: rito said: bet.
[2:40:52] Yuukily: this is why im excited about the skill based LP gains
[2:40:55] flacsmada: fair
[2:40:57] Yuukily: and not MMR
[2:41:02] lilCACTUSS9: I had a suspicion a couple years ago, but eventually I realized I'm just paranoid, BUT I had a series of games where one of the games had an afk player and as soon as we realized the enemy team has an afk, someone from my team got disconnected. And vice versa, when we had afk, someone from the enemy team got disconnected
[2:41:07] idckdolphins: I do feel like there is indeed a Loser Queue
[2:41:14] flacsmada: @KayPea  maybe run at the noc, charm him, then flash away?
[2:41:17] FeedTheTank: @KayPea Riot just need to make it like in Valorant, where you can see your mmr and what you lose each time :D
[2:41:20] lilCACTUSS9: It was reeeeealy sus, but I haven't encountered this ever since
[2:41:24] Yuukily: dont jinx us girl
[2:41:25] lady1chaos: Hello hello <3
[2:41:25] Yuukily: lmao
[2:41:27] mitskicks: i was winning 30lp in a winning streak and suddenly matchmaking gives me a tf top that went 0/8 and afked lol
[2:41:44] ObsceneSanity: i dont think theyre gunna do the skill base mmr bc it would cause more balancing issues
[2:42:00] BigDaddyGaddy07: BigDaddyGaddy07 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! YESS!
[2:42:09] flacsmada: @KayPea do they ever hard reset mmr?
[2:42:10] Yuukily: My Smurf almost the same rank as my main .. LMAO
[2:42:13] jimbob_ywert: what’s your rank goal this season?
[2:42:14] solitigre: is that a KP Pin-Up back there?
[2:42:34] Omicroad: That's so true old accounts are fcked
[2:42:35] PoloxPlox: but my skins and all my champions and perks
[2:42:35] BigDaddyGaddy07: Good Morning KayPea!
[2:42:50] Jaguar542: Riots next tweet: Riot hate you in particularly, that's why we have given you inters and Irons on your team against diamond smurfs! Get ready for your ten lose spree! LUL
[2:42:54] solitigre: cute HypeLUL
[2:43:01] BigDaddyGaddy07: good How are you?
[2:43:06] Darkcyter: @BigDaddyGaddy07 WB
[2:43:07] idckdolphins: Agree with this btw. New accounts actually show you if you're improved.
[2:43:10] PoloxPlox: then smurfing is a natural occurance
[2:43:15] bapplez69: G'morning KayPea!
[2:43:21] BE_OH_WHY: kelsie i love u but i climbed with my account from i think season 2
[2:43:23] BigDaddyGaddy07: @Darkcyter thnx!
[2:43:25] Ecak01: After 6 years of playing I just got to gold, never stepped foot in this elo
[2:43:26] jimbob_ywert: I’m an old account, why am I fked?
[2:43:27] TheLiin: i think the reason new accounts make you climb higher is because of momentum
[2:43:30] lilCACTUSS9: Full mmr reset at the end of every season. With the current state of the game, people with low mmr keep suffering and don't get the chance to ever get out and people with diamond mmr get the green card to climb faster again @KayPea
[2:43:35] BE_OH_WHY: from gold 2 to emerald last split in 2 days and smoekd alot of weed i coulda played better
[2:43:35] idckdolphins: Made new account -> in 15 games I was gold 3, I'm hardstuck Silver IV on my main account of 3 years now.
[2:43:37] GibsonGaming: imagine all the money they make from skins on people making new accounts because of that
[2:43:41] BE_OH_WHY: u just talkin to much about it
[2:43:41] Ecak01: Granted I had to duo with a diamond Janna support LUL
[2:43:53] Yuukily: Someone said that if they reset MMR and put everyone in Iron that we would see a major difference
[2:43:55] ElderFrost420: Hey Kels. How have the matches been today?
[2:43:59] solitigre: I bounce between 2 accounts. should I go for 3??
[2:44:17] idckdolphins: @GibsonGaming tbh.. i still have no skins on my new acc
[2:44:18] FeedTheTank: @KayPea Like Riot just needs to make it like in Valorant, where you can see your mmr and what you lose each time :D
[2:44:19] FiveFM: It do be seeming like they have a "history" that applies harder than is exactly accurate.
[2:44:20] Hamochakita: @KayPea how basically how tether abilities work in the game the game checks the frame every 0.25 sec so multiple check points if at some point you got far enough once the check point happens the ability brakes. sorry if the explanation is not the best but i hope its gets the idea across
[2:44:21] DNCTheRock: !EU
[2:44:21] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[2:44:46] idckdolphins: Riot should hard resset
[2:44:54] ObsceneSanity: its a shit show now

[2:45:05] jimbob_ywert: rank is so much more complicated to balance in games where skill is depended on 10 players. if you look at Fortnite’s solo ranked system, no one complains because it’s the skill of YOU that ONLY matters.
[2:45:06] DeepInCryo: just do a MMR reset for those under Master
[2:45:11] Yuukily: ALSO CAN WE TALK ABOUT The 3 SPLITS ? LMAO LIKE WHYYYYY
[2:45:18] flacsmada: @KayPea well it would be a shit show for high elo, but instead its a shit show for 98 percent of the community
[2:45:18] solitigre: how are the pastries in Denmark?? I’m jelly.
[2:45:19] Darkcyter: @Phoenix_nj WB
[2:45:22] nicorasenpai: @KayPea  u should work in riot atp and kick all those useless people there

[2:45:28] BigDaddyGaddy07: I vote KayPea become the top person For riots programing design
[2:45:28] TheLiin: if they force you to stay in your elo it would be fun to see a high elo player take over a 5+ season stuck silver account
[2:45:29] HuskiesSymphony: Yesterday my duo and I had an ashe on the enemy team that just ran it down mid. She ended like 0/15
[2:45:40] idckdolphins: I had a jg Yummi in Silver.
[2:45:44] FeedTheTank: @Yuukily to give more people a chance to get into ranked, but 2 was fine for that tho
[2:45:59] Yuukily: @FeedTheTank thats what i mean, 2 was enough idk why 3
[2:46:07] flacsmada: @HuskiesSymphony 2 days ago my mid ran it down cuz i didnt gank in first 3 minutes, ended up 2/27
[2:46:08] BigDaddyGaddy07: to much work i bet to try and keep up with everything

[2:46:39] solitigre: HypeLUL HypeLUL HypeLUL HypeLUL
[2:46:42] idckdolphins: I bet they'll get max to gold.
[2:46:43] jimbob_ywert: well to be fair it is hard to work in an environment where there’s over 150 champs and over a million different opinions, but they’re a large company they should eventually work it out
[2:46:49] lilCACTUSS9: same
[2:46:53] ElderFrost420: No!!! Not the ads!!!!
[2:47:06] FiveFM: Nope - they'd be put in the Smurf queue... Rito never said that smurf queue doesn't exist LUL kaypCaptainMaple
[2:47:13] nicorasenpai: im having a good time in gold elo rn all people are just risking in team fights
[2:47:24] Ecak01: Basically me LUL
[2:47:31] Yuukily: theres a 7X's challenger player who talked about Emerald rank, he was stuck in that rank and it was a coinflip everygame.. this person HAS BEEN CHALLENGER OVER 5 TIMES thats what is crazy to me
[2:47:38] idckdolphins: Ok, Kaypea, You're Emerald.. I'll give you my account I'm silver. Go climb xD
[2:47:55] Conmac84: Just Look at Lilypipichu Kappa
[2:47:56] angelofdeathjonathan: I have seen challengers lose in bronze and silver
[2:47:58] nicorasenpai: there are people whos stuck in silver having 100+ wins
[2:48:04] solitigre: HypePopcorn
[2:48:14] nicorasenpai: @Conmac84 ?
[2:48:19] TheLiin: @idckdolphins ill do it
[2:48:20] hey_m31: its not just the emerald rank but the fucked mmr that seems to come with it
[2:48:22] GibsonGaming: @KayPea What are the green straps? Is it a back straightening thing?
[2:48:28] SquamSquam: Riot needs to figure it out... there is always a laner quitting or feeding...
[2:48:34] SquamSquam: they nbeed to match them amoungt themselves
[2:48:36] FeedTheTank: i get how there is huge gap in skill between plat and diamond, but emerald is stll too much to balance it out imo
[2:48:37] Yuukily: tbh emerald fucked the MMR even more, thats what ive noticed
[2:48:41] Martybggg: i think adding emerald was a mistake
[2:48:41] SquamSquam: let them fester in their own pool
[2:48:44] kattoad: do u have a posture correcxtor thing on? ive beenthink about getting one, does it hurt ur back?
[2:48:45] idckdolphins: @TheLiin hahaha, nah.. I'll try harder and will get to gold myself, thanks tho!
[2:48:52] FeedTheTank: @Yuukily agreed
[2:48:54] amaan097: poppy into belveth and vayne thats scary goodluck
[2:48:57] hey_m31: like as soon as i hit emerald its +16/-27 for some reason even though my wr is 57%
[2:49:00] jakabolta: emerald is bad elo bcs there are people who are stuck in this elo and are actuall good and some people that has gotten busted to emerald and are bad so you win losable games and lost winnable games
[2:49:01] Jaguar542: Lux LuvHearts

[2:51:11] TheLiin: the issue imo with emerald is the LP gains make it easier to get there by promoting from plat or demoting from diamond but harder to get out, so its a pithole
[2:51:14] ElderFrost420: I'll watch it as soon as I turn on my computer
[2:51:26] Yuukily: kels do you have a stream deck ?

[3:42:34] Niomah: I think I'm going to start playing some bots to broaden my acceptably played champ pool next month then maybe, MAYBE I'll play some normals, because I miss the strategy side of the Rift that is missing in ARAM
[3:42:44] jimbob_ywert: Funnily enough, Taliyah and Graves are duo.
