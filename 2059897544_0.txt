[3:54:01] what_head: you havent thought about learning about break out another thousand
[3:54:01] Mcbensky: i think the idea is to test knowledge
[3:54:02] Brivin: The fun of it for most people is to test your knowledge
[3:54:03] BroccoliYumYum: it's 100% cheating
[3:54:03] BikeWithWheels: you could also ignore the boats category

[3:54:25] BikeWithWheels: this is a test of knowledge
[3:54:26] buhfarmer: me cheat on league all the time nodd
[3:54:32] AbuTalib: I got so much hate for being a noob at league when I created my first league account :(
[3:54:43] eViral: at the end of the day you are educating yourself by googling definitions either way
[3:54:44] God0ne: I mean if I google something during a test its cheating. If I knew it before the test its not KEKWiggle
[3:54:46] combowombowombo: during a pro game if you looked up builds would it be cheating idk
[3:54:46] buhfarmer: SUS
[3:54:48] BroccoliYumYum: i'm cracking up over here
[3:54:48] Mcbensky: league was made to be learned
[3:54:50] combowombowombo: i mean its not that deep
[3:54:56] BroccoliYumYum: no one cares if you google though, idt.

[3:57:48] Waibop: Can't even be happy learning new words only shamed by twitch chat imNOTcrying
[3:57:48] SiIent_K: No, it's not. Your chat is being dumb. The point of the game is to find the connections between things. Not the defintions. Therefore finding definitions is not circumventing what the game is about.
[3:57:58] BroccoliYumYum: 3 mid!
