[1:51:32] Kappadog2999: Nasus w doesnt affect q cd, its all about spacing
[1:51:49] BlueNightRose: @juledmvp its not even that it sucks for yone it is just they warp the game for the entire team. With darius or panth you can just play super safe and deal with them later but those champs always have a presence
