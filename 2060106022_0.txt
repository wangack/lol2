[0:28:24] SerWestbrook: ok boomer
[0:28:32] williazom: @Nightblue3 What if Riot would release a League classic like WoW did man?
[0:28:33] ZeBasterd1: "A guy with 1000 AP one-shotting you." Sounds familiar KEKW
[0:28:47] exentrius: when i first started league one of my very first games there were 3 kills total and we got the dub
[0:28:47] EmeraldCityJester: wait fortnite is fast?
[0:28:48] LemonMaster: @Nightblue3 felt the same from shooters. i used to enjoy playing shooters but i can't stand it anymore
[0:28:55] zahdielI: newer players like that fast paced gameplay tho and that makes money. We are too old
[0:29:00] Zevoest: ye kinda weird that u cant even outplay most of the time coz everything just oneshots with one item
[0:29:05] MaxMahmood100: gotta attract now audience maybe that's why
[0:29:06] KingTurtleMan: fortnite? if anything fortnite slowed down typical shooters. youre looking for COD.

[0:29:07] bkbodegacat: i kinda like shorter games though
[0:29:08] blackbear057: nb3Smile nb3Wave
[0:29:08] FireXIII: I think the reason is the Chinese law where kids can only play like 2 hours a day so games need to be faster
[0:29:14] Anqv1st: @Nightblue3 They should remove 3-5 Lethality from all the Lethality items and give most of them some haste to compensate and maybe add a Hunter rune that gives 5 Haste + 3 per takedown or something
[0:29:27] EmeraldCityJester: league is basically yugioh at this point, win in opening hand or lose

[1:06:12] mttan97: nb3Hi
[1:06:14] gkeram13: @nightblue3 what u expected to get as answer ??
[1:06:16] Grantag: They have a bias in their matchmaking somewhere
[1:06:31] RaikouWolf: looks like this Jhin gets banned from ranked allot, or plays aram 90 percent of the time on opgg
[1:06:35] mttan97: hi hi
[1:06:38] visionimpossible: some might say that as soon as anyone queues up they are in losers q Clueless
[1:06:39] mttan97: ouch

[1:06:41] williazom: @Nightblue3 What if Riot would release a League classic like Blizzard did with WoW classic man?
[1:06:43] CALIBER1996: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hNKLTmB5p1U
[1:06:51] TheMinisterOfGaming: the whole 30/30/30 rule IS winners/loser Q XD & they admit that is how it works all the time
[1:06:57] mrcodfish: He moved so it didnt make him go afk xD
[1:06:59] xBenethor: for me losers q is that u have 3 secondary or autofill in ur team while enemy team has 5 main role players

[1:08:18] EmeraldCityJester: 'report now is on the player to fix things' LOL
[1:08:25] the_real_keila: losers queue is coded unintentionally. They balance teams so that a good player gets worse team mates.
[1:08:27] Grantag: They know their matchmaking is biased and not very good, or they wouldn't be publicly talking about changing it
[1:08:51] GandorTheGreat: Ppl look for patterns. Bad chance games happen and u notice/remember them more. There's no loosers queue. Just bad games @nightblue3

[1:09:17] Cinteleaf: can we play qiyana???
[1:09:17] TheMinisterOfGaming: even if winners/loser Q isn't on purpose its 100% possible for so many reasons that they wouldn't even be able to track or now.
[1:09:18] Jidai_Geki: there is also a winners queue however
[1:09:20] CALIBER1996: losers que is like nicotine addicgt, once ur going down the path there is no return

[1:19:46] Eternal_Em: not if I was villain in an action movie
[1:19:47] wulfricin: helicopters land with no motor/rotor power

[1:20:02] Grantag: They can auto-rotate, but that's iffy
[1:20:02] ZeroG01: I'm a helo pilot and they crash much better than planes
[1:20:03] inconixxx: well dont jump then.. just fall out
[1:20:03] the_real_keila: It won't fall on you, you both fall the same speed
[1:20:05] mttan97: rip kobe
[1:20:05] TheMinisterOfGaming: @Pon_Solo xD i was gonna say that makes a difference lol
[1:20:29] FireXIII: this game looks pretty normal, no abnormal enemy behavior Okayeg

[1:21:06] gef0o: you dont need to jump
[1:21:11] williazom: @Nightblue3 but why would you jump man?
[1:21:13] ZeroG01: You don't
[1:21:13] the_real_keila: Gravity pulls you and the heli the same speed
[1:21:20] BrisingrReborn: Weight means nothing to gravity
[1:21:22] bamtrelele: hello from greece <3
[1:21:25] mrbolikas: its the same as a plane if its going down u are too
[1:21:27] Roflstalker: If you are at the point where you need to jump out of a flying vehicle, you are already in a pretty bad place regardless.
[1:21:28] buttsnackey: there is a lever that stops the blades

[1:21:29] Aquuil: you dont eject from plane too lol
[1:21:29] LiquidSlimeKnight: you sink with the ship
[1:21:30] elt007: dont wanna play rust agine ??
[1:21:31] TheMinisterOfGaming: for me it would matter more on the driver/pilot than the car/plane etc
[1:21:33] GandorTheGreat: U can't just jump from any larger plane too
[1:21:34] Mugungo: are you brinin a parachute as a carry on??
[1:21:36] bioniclebob: You don't just die like man Kappa
[1:21:38] syxoed13: @Nightblue3 you end helicopter free fall at the same speed because of the acceleration of gravity is the same

[1:22:12] Grantag: lose a tail rotor and I think its ff
[1:22:16] TheMinisterOfGaming: there a large difference from a military copter with people that planned to get out. vs a normal new copter & a normal person xD
[1:22:18] buckner: you change angle of blades to use them like a parachute
[1:22:19] alpha1337x: @ my thoughts exactlyoverxposed
[1:22:20] nrwinner_: Some Russian military helicopters have ejection seats in the helos where they blow the rotors off the top a few seconds before you eject
[1:22:24] Blackgh00st: most league players dont need their heads anyway
[1:22:27] kazupiexu: planes are scary too ngl
[1:22:28] kirs1y: Not a bad way to go though p fast
[1:22:30] NoPlsY: Safer to stay in both
[1:22:31] MymicLuka: thats why they check like every milimetar befor flight
[1:22:33] the_real_keila: It actually is simple, just jump out :D
[1:22:43] soaringzoro: jump down from a helicopter dont jump up
[1:22:44] Mugungo: most planes dont have a parachute though mugungRANT
[1:22:45] LemonMaster: in both cases its more safe to stay in and not jump
[1:22:45] Sawash93: what about the massive turbine?
[1:22:47] Tenseiken_: yeah just massive turbines and massive plane
[1:23:01] ZeroG01: If you lose your rotor then you are fucked
[1:23:04] lovaznow: the helicópter did not have a black box
[1:23:13] dalfaro90: Imagine just not jumping out of a plane ez
[1:23:51] TheMinisterOfGaming: With how poorly planes have been keep up with if youbeen watching the news xD maybe we all need to start learning how to dive out
[1:23:53] imjuzus: if u think about it everything is dangerous
[1:24:06] Roflstalker: Hey guys, don't go into a building! It you wanna get out but it collapes on you it's GG!
[1:24:09] kazupiexu: what if you above the ocean tho… where are you gonna jump ☠️🙏🏻
[1:24:17] inconixxx: you dont jump from helicopters.. you just fall out from them. theres no reason to jump
[1:24:19] kazupiexu: fly above*
[1:24:21] CaribbeanCask: Kobe's pilot was an idiot that flew into dense fog with zero visibility. Nothing to do with helicopters themselves

[1:24:58] CaribbeanCask: A helicopter only spins when you experience loss of tail rotor effectiveness due to environmental or mechanical failures which is pretty rare
[1:25:25] the_real_keila: @CaribbeanCask Mainly happens in movies
[1:25:25] ZeroG01: We did then every day as part of pilot training
[1:25:29] visionimpossible: average american can jump out of a helicopter whitouf fear Clueless
[1:25:31] CaribbeanCask: Planes are far more dangerous if something goes wrong. We can auto rotate into a small parking lot
[1:25:43] TheMinisterOfGaming: nb3 thinking he the bad guy in a action movie @CaribbeanCask so pretty high chance for him xD
[1:25:55] CaribbeanCask: You can't jump out of either machine if it's crashing
[1:26:14] cornflakesdekellogs: MAN u have no chance to survive anyways... Small plsne or helicopter IS the same shit if something goes weong
