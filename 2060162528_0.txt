[2:31:37] Strawb3wy: it will make us artist jobless eavLost
[2:31:39] gastbanaan: people need to work to keep busy, if they have no meaning in life they will become unhappy
[2:31:40] Raienjin: @IKeepItTaco no one has to work with AI?...so how the fuck you make money then? :D
[2:31:45] czimiczangi: so yeah we are lost
[2:31:54] valllentiino: Man another document just dropped
[2:31:57] valllentiino: Sadge
[2:32:13] skitter_bb: another document?
[2:32:23] valllentiino: yesterday tbf
[2:32:24] justfourfunn: In the future, humanity may be like the Walle movie cause of A.I
[2:32:28] Megabooy1: I think AI will stay mostly as a tool to avoid tedious shit and alot of memes i guess
[2:32:35] Klony99: @shadow_boi1 Because early or because it was heavy stuff? You'll manage until the end of the semester, I just know it.
[2:32:41] chewyontop: Taco can you sett flash ult?
[2:32:52] Klony99: @coreyelle Eyo ecstatic is great. What's got you excited?!

[2:33:53] shadow_boi1: @Klony99 Ayyy niceu
[2:34:08] roders_m8: Life
[2:34:16] Grepski: agreed, society the way its structured currently sucks for humanity
[2:34:30] Strawb3wy: but there will always be people who will abuse it Life
[2:34:36] shadow_boi1: @IKeepItTaco That sounds awfully communist, the american in me doesn't like it... I've given him an official eviction notice, come back to me in a week and I'll agree.
[2:34:37] coreyelle: @Klony99 >:3 yeshm
[2:34:40] Klony99: Ohhh we getting philosophical? I think it's important that we get more tools, so when we eventually come together and cut off society's heavy head, we have all those tools to play with.
[2:34:44] Konishi611: ya. im a much bigger fan of having BJ than AI
[2:34:45] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Like a an ai that help diagnosed cancer more accurate than human
[2:34:55] gastbanaan: the only way to enjoy life if to make people realise what the value of something is. if things have no value cause everyone can do it no one will appreciate it
[2:35:23] czimiczangi: my teams in league are full of ai
[2:35:30] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Like using ai for medical industry
[2:35:31] kheanurose: im just interested in vr fapping
[2:35:40] YGLD0: ai already replaced my brain
[2:35:51] Komlin111: FeelsBadMan
[2:36:04] Klony99: I don't know about the level, I just don't think AI Art can innovate properly. It just throws together all the things that already exist.
[2:36:11] Klony99: It can feed off itself but that'll lead to artifacting.
[2:36:28] machina_00: WHY NOT!!! immagin an ai researching and developing new technologies planning colonies on other planets and so on
[2:36:38] Komlin111: why do I have to vs 800k quinn onetricks
[2:36:38] Klony99: I never had an American in me but I came awfully close that one time I was stopped in NYC.
[2:36:39] Trodsy: AI to teach me how to play Kappa
[2:36:58] YGLD0: ai to fix your mental after losing
[2:36:59] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Researchers has create AI that can diagnose breast cancer faster and more accurate than human
[2:37:04] machina_00: humanity in general
[2:37:09] KatakIysm: what do u play if jhin is banned?
[2:37:11] kitingmechanicsoutonsteam: anyone plays loldodge game to warm up?
[2:37:13] alinator7: "the animals are leaving"
[2:37:18] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Elon musk
[2:37:23] Klony99: ... I don't mind Bezos leaving.
[2:37:24] Dubatt0: can we get an AI that can help me find a girlfriend Sadge
[2:37:33] Klony99: @Dubatt0 It can't perform miracles.
[2:37:42] YGLD0: @Dubatt0 ai is better than human girlfriend
[2:37:49] kaiserwroth: Earth 2.0 will be an online hub like in ready player one
[2:37:52] lolwutpotat0: !playlist
[2:37:52] Nightbot: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7MDlPY7p4vSJKBfegl6GfI?si=45f2feba7a9748ec
[2:37:53] Klony99: But hey, have you considered AI girlfriends?
[2:37:54] Hoytastic: Billionaires be like : slavery is legal on mars
[2:37:57] MrPepperJams: PepeHands it was a 4:20 quite time lobby tho
[2:37:58] SaltedIIIBlueberries: C.ai
[2:38:03] MrPepperJams: *que time
[2:38:04] Komlin111: weroreDead
[2:38:05] Texxin: You should read "We are Legion, We are Bob". Its about a software engineer who becomes an AI in the future, and ends up colonizing other solar systems. It creates an entire civilization.
[2:38:06] Texxin: Pretty wild
[2:38:10] SaltedIIIBlueberries: C.ai has a lot of custom ai
[2:38:10] Dubatt0: bro i am NOT going from 2d anime girls to AI girls
[2:38:18] MF_FADED: The only ai i like is ai pathing
[2:38:26] Strawb3wy: Nessie
[2:38:31] Klony99: @Texxin That synopsis reminds me of The Last Question by Aasimov.
[2:38:33] KAP_out: @machina_00 it literally cant, thats the problem. right now ai isnt good enough to make up new things, it can only use existing data to come to a conclusion faster
[2:38:44] Klony99: @Dubatt0 But what if 2D Anime AI GF?
[2:38:48] alinator7: I'm training a deep learning ai for my grad project as we speak
[2:38:58] hhak147: Why are you playing mid instead of bot?
[2:39:00] Dubatt0: @Dubatt0 maybe.
[2:39:15] Dubatt0: ngl i wish we had same technology as they have in cyberpunk
[2:39:23] Dubatt0: id chrome the FUCK out of myself
[2:39:33] lolwutpotat0: i like ur music
[2:39:35] Klony99: @KAP_out That's incredibly inaccurate. AI can make new things. They are just not within certain human parameters. AI art for example is definitely new - nobody drew these abominations before. But they aren't "realistic" at all.
[2:39:38] machina_00: @KAP_out @KAP_out true we are not investing in it or awaiting it ot grow
[2:39:54] Klony99: @Dubatt0 Same.
[2:39:58] Mcsevem77: look at this photograph
[2:39:58] Strawb3wy: Nerd
[2:40:01] shadow_boi1: 'Surprisingly' are you insulting my GF taco?
[2:40:02] valllentiino: Nerd
[2:40:12] valllentiino: me when adc carries MHMM
[2:40:14] Dubatt0: BLABBERING
[2:40:14] YGLD0: imagine getting carried by a rat xdd
[2:40:30] Dubatt0: taco when someone talks about teams BLABBERING
[2:40:37] kaiserwroth: essaying
[2:40:41] Strawb3wy: KEKW
[2:40:46] valllentiino: Chatting Chatting Chatting
[2:40:50] valllentiino: essaying essaying essaying
[2:41:05] Klony99: Huh?
[2:41:07] ScarlyScars: is the AI talk over? ikeepitRAREHANDS
[2:41:12] flux3003: TheVoices
[2:41:36] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Would it be if I train the on your voices?
[2:41:41] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Okay*
[2:41:53] lbku: thoughts on crit builds in 14.3? should i still be going lethality in lower elo?
[2:42:05] Strawb3wy: go the fast
[2:42:06] SaltedIIIBlueberries: TTS**
[2:42:16] gastbanaan: is that the reksai sound effect?
[2:42:20] YGLD0: i feel like stormrizer into crit is better after the nerfs
[2:43:09] YGLD0: so how do you decide from going fleetwork or the other?
[2:44:26] Klony99: @ScarlyScars We done now. It's allright friend.
[2:44:27] FlameLexzz: heyo taco! how were your games so far
[2:44:40] alinator7: How did you come to the realization that streaming full time is not the career you wanna pursue?
[2:44:55] YGLD0: if the enemy is bitch go fleetwork. got it letcook letcook
[2:45:06] dracula_coffin: what's your career?
[2:45:10] Strawb3wy: eavDancey
[2:45:24] Klony99: ... Felt.
[2:45:28] Strawb3wy: so u have 2 jobs now?
[2:45:35] Strawb3wy: eavWow
[2:45:35] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Cana you try climbing league on SG/MY server?
[2:45:41] Klony99: That's why I stopped playing Ranked entirely. I felt like I was trying my best and got punished for investing myself.
[2:45:59] alinator7: did you consider becoming a variety streamer? im sure the majority of people are here for you, not jhin
[2:46:00] Klony99: Meanwhile TFT allows me to take accountability for every game. It's only me and the RNG.
[2:46:07] flux3003: maybe switch to other games in the future?
[2:46:11] shadow_boi1: @Strawb3wy 3. Streaming. Analyst and babysitter.
[2:46:19] Strawb3wy: do what makes u happy daco eavEav
[2:46:24] Strawb3wy: @shadow_boi1 dang
[2:46:29] Klony99: What Strawb3wy said.
[2:46:30] rarichi_ii: Just get better teammates :)
[2:46:54] Strawb3wy: eavNod
[2:47:03] brokenwolf59: I feel ya. Don't play league as much anymore because of that. Been playing Fighting Games and they are so much more rewarding
[2:47:08] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Can you try play on SG/MY server for once?
[2:47:18] Therealmusty: Jump into the FGC when project l comes out
[2:47:21] Klony99: You have been doing more variety, I appreciate it honestly. It's fun to watch you play games.
[2:47:31] Klony99: You're enjoying yourself more than I would playing games like Elden Ring.
[2:48:19] Strawb3wy: idc what u play i watch anyways eavEav bc Its fun staying here
[2:48:48] rarichi_ii: He really stayed in place lmao
[2:49:05] flux3003: Despairge
[2:49:06] ramossergiu: 5 on mid
[2:49:18] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Riot take that out of context
[2:49:18] Abomination_PC: @IKeepItTaco I understand that reasoning behind teammates. Thats why i cant wait for arena to return. It feels alot more fun to just be able to have some rng to blame.
[2:49:37] laikanangel: Oh no. The descent has begun
[2:49:40] SaltedIIIBlueberries: !dude
[2:49:40] Nightbot: Ayman showed the limitation of his vocabulary 408 times. Dude, learn a new word.

[2:51:26] brokenwolf59: Yeah that's true a lot to learn
[2:51:29] NuclearMonje: I've moved from league to fighting games. I think it just depends if you want to learn
[2:51:30] rarichi_ii: Oh
[2:51:34] rarichi_ii: We got a party
[2:51:42] sasandahalf: BibleThump BibleThump
[2:51:45] NuclearMonje: I would say there's just as much as learning mobas for the first time.
[2:52:00] laikanangel: Learning a fighting game is about as much of a time investment as learning the average MOBA. It takes a while
[2:52:03] brokenwolf59: Big time investment and you gotta be ready to lose a lot
[2:52:21] alinator7: you seem like you'd enjoy card games with your analytical background and your strategic gameplay style in league
[2:52:37] hhak147: What about tft? People use there as league retirement house
[2:52:59] Strawb3wy: play some minecraft eavComf
[2:53:07] Megabooy1: I have started to change into single player games. People are to agressiv online at the time, its not really fun'n'games no more atleast not for me

[2:56:23] shadow_boi1: KEKW
[2:57:03] jetstream_salmon: Yeah, I hate the leprechaun skin, but then again, I'm biased
[2:58:12] liquid_gabs: @Megabooy1 yeah, I hated the feeling of playing in summoners rift, 50 minute game just for someone in your team go brain dead and waste everybodys time
[2:59:12] shadow_boi1: @Strawb3wy Minecraft server with the lads pausecham
[2:59:25] khlori: idk in aram it's just whoever gets better champ wins 90% of hte time

[3:03:53] MossAlbatross: understandable to find it annoying af tho
[3:04:06] khlori: Mages being gigabroken episode 200
[3:04:44] laikanangel: @WizardPug That's totally fair. Besides, he's a charming little gremlin
[3:04:49] Cr1pZZz_: people never seem to know that veigar has the cage, and always go into it, and they are ALWAYS amazed by the R dmg
[3:05:04] MossAlbatross: @WizardPug his voicelines are the cutest/funniest in the game
[3:05:10] joax_on_you: hello TACO i am big FAN !!!! whats ur opinion on jungle!!!

[3:07:39] Megabooy1: @inv1k3 always dh but fleet because it is a farm lane i think
[3:07:45] czimiczangi: @inv1k3 when sustain and speed
[3:07:45] virgin0il: fascism mode activated
[3:08:18] belsito_02: bro is mad
[3:08:34] Cr1pZZz_: that game is so impossible to win, veigar and smolder, not outscalable

[3:13:04] chipichipichapachapagr: And it's a masters game, these games remind me of silver/gold behaviour
[3:13:29] czimiczangi: its always winnable, its 50/50 you either win or lose so lets try to the end
[3:14:03] Klony99: @IKeepItTaco So, why does it say "Our Twitch Prime" on the bottom left? :>

Six is right out. Once the number four, being the fourth number, be reached, then shootest thou thy Fourth Shot towards thy foe, who, being imperfect in My sight, shall snuff it."
