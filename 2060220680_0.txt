[0:59:53] MyckaT: ap nasus
[1:00:09] 514484: or even sirhcez
[1:00:23] pavel444: sir Chez?
[1:00:26] 514484: it's absolutely trolly, no resist or hp on a nasus
[1:00:28] TouchMyFish: Sirchez been using AP Nasus a lot
[1:00:50] 514484: these guys build this jank on nasus because they are bored, not because it is good
[1:00:51] pavel444: who is this sir? Chez?
[1:01:00] Lazynameross: but you get hp while ulting Kappa which he can now do more often
[1:01:03] TouchMyFish: friend of Trick2G
[1:01:31] LeRoiVert: ap nasus is good midgame
[1:01:38] LeRoiVert: much more presence
[1:01:42] pavel444: does he like to play chess? more like SirChess OneHand
[1:01:47] LeRoiVert: flash on nasus tho
[1:01:52] LeRoiVert: is a bad pick most of the time
[1:03:26] LeRoiVert: twitch 1v9
[1:04:23] LeRoiVert: still has 700 shutdown
[1:04:26] LeRoiVert: after the death

[1:05:57] 514484: this bounty system is stoopid
[1:06:01] LetTheScoutCook: Press X
[1:06:06] LeRoiVert: hes full build
[1:06:10] pavel444: X
[1:06:16] LeRoiVert: now twitch falls off cuz no more items
[1:06:29] LetTheScoutCook: yea the bounty system makes the game extremely coinflipy
[1:06:49] Lazynameross: twitch doesnt swap collector out at full build?
[1:07:27] 514484: oh my, anathema with wither monkaS
[1:07:58] Lazynameross: lee ult
[1:08:08] Lazynameross: it has a micro before kick
[1:08:43] LeRoiVert: so much shroom damage being dealt
[1:09:38] Lazynameross: how many more times can nasus q during ult?
[1:09:46] Lazynameross: is it 2x as much?
[1:09:54] LeRoiVert: yeah half the cd during ult
[1:09:59] Lazynameross: kk
[1:10:51] LeRoiVert: malignance + steraks is something new
[1:12:47] LeRoiVert: oh wow its gm
[1:13:40] LeRoiVert: blue team fought for no reason too much
[1:13:44] LeRoiVert: and didnt get objectives
[1:13:52] LeRoiVert: and picked bad fights
[1:16:12] jordyutopia: hello mr pavv
[1:16:24] pavel444: hello
[1:16:48] LeRoiVert: fuyken melee teemo
[1:16:52] LeRoiVert: he misplayed that
[1:16:58] LeRoiVert: teemo shouldve survived there
[1:17:01] LeRoiVert: 100% of the time
[1:17:20] LeRoiVert: no, teemo went melee
[1:18:18] 514484: circus top LUL
[1:18:20] LeRoiVert: yeah huge waste
[1:19:13] LeRoiVert: lvl6 akali vs lvl8 karma xd
[1:19:21] LeRoiVert: 46 cs
[1:19:43] LeRoiVert: lvl7 vs lvl 10
[1:21:01] LeRoiVert: fleet teemo
[1:21:04] LeRoiVert: wouldve done MUCH better
[1:21:08] LeRoiVert: in lane
[1:21:23] Chris_Twitch: alan plays a lot of fleet
[1:21:24] LeRoiVert: also his first death was purely his misplay and couldve easily avoided
[1:21:50] pIasmate: teemo made the mistake of pushing bot instead of shrooming lanes to defend IMO
[1:22:17] LeRoiVert: but pta doesnt help with that
[1:22:39] LeRoiVert: i dont think pta is ever good vs nasus
[1:22:42] LeRoiVert: cuz wither
[1:23:57] pIasmate: mid to late game teemo can't get 3 hits on 1 enemy because of burst and cc though
[1:24:06] pIasmate: so pta becomes useless
[1:25:45] LeRoiVert: here he shouldve ran towards naut
[1:25:54] LeRoiVert: his first death was his owwn fault
[1:26:04] pIasmate: watch his shrooms, how many just fizzle and how many get stepped on maybe
[1:26:08] LeRoiVert: wrong rune... like, theres small mistakes like that
[1:26:18] LeRoiVert: yeah he went melee vs nasus
[1:26:23] LeRoiVert: he couldve easily ran awya
[1:26:28] LeRoiVert: watch
[1:27:42] LeRoiVert: sure, but its all about making small improvements
[1:27:43] twitchsuckstoday: gotta learn to do tactical retreats in team fights
[1:27:46] LeRoiVert: theres only so much one person can do
[1:28:04] pIasmate: I find staying clumped with the team as a teemo generally ends badly
[1:28:10] pIasmate: better to flank with shrooms
[1:28:14] pIasmate: and hit and run
[1:29:22] LeRoiVert: yeah alistar caught him here
[1:29:48] twitchsuckstoday: alistar did good
[1:30:27] pIasmate: also karma kinda counters most of the team
[1:31:21] pIasmate: that teemo has good shroom placement during fights
[1:31:43] 514484: can't win everything
[1:31:56] pavel444: yes, someone should let him know that we are watching it.
[1:31:59] pikapika_666_: main problem = Teemo :D :D
[1:32:14] LeRoiVert: last game was purely bad macro
[1:32:18] LeRoiVert: on blue side
[1:32:21] LeRoiVert: imo
[1:32:26] pIasmate: last game the problem was teemo pushed bot
[1:32:33] pIasmate: instead of shrooming defense
[1:32:55] LeRoiVert: missed 4 cs ouch
[1:33:22] LeRoiVert: missed cannon
[1:33:26] LeRoiVert: yeah its doomed KEKL
[1:33:44] pikapika_666_: good doggy
[1:34:08] twitchsuckstoday: what in macro aram tarnations was that
[1:34:10] twitchsuckstoday: at 3 min
[1:35:59] twitchsuckstoday: use passive more often
[1:36:45] pIasmate: teemo didn't dodge, ww just missed lol
[1:36:54] 514484: accidental
[1:36:54] MyckaT: scripts can
[1:36:58] LeRoiVert: nah ww just missed
[1:38:36] twitchsuckstoday: hes using shrooms to perma push
[1:39:07] twitchsuckstoday: we are not seeing def shrooms
[1:40:40] twitchsuckstoday: ipavCrying space taimo death cry
[1:40:55] pIasmate: wasting shrooms on minions is not maximising gameplay..
[1:41:12] MyckaT: thats called scripting
[1:41:17] JayeLau: ipaav when he was younger
[1:41:47] pIasmate: and be open to ganks
[1:41:56] pIasmate: which is why he keeps dying
[1:42:01] JayeLau: low tier has so no sense of macro or lane control
[1:42:06] pIasmate: with no shrooms to defend
[1:42:06] JayeLau: @pIasmate what i tell you
[1:42:18] pIasmate: it's high risk
[1:42:39] twitchsuckstoday: top tier map awareness no need to fear ganks
[1:43:01] pIasmate: I mean he's died twice to ganks
[1:43:06] pIasmate: because non stop push
[1:43:15] 514484: we like non-stop puch
[1:43:50] suppaahh: do u know that u can get turret dived? @plasmate even if u dont push
[1:43:58] 514484: freezing means your other lanes get ganked more
[1:44:19] editos9541: ipavLick
[1:44:38] MyckaT: waait it is not?
[1:44:43] pIasmate: I never said anything about freezing lol
[1:44:44] twitchsuckstoday: teemo needs gold bad
[1:45:04] pIasmate: teemo has 3 deaths because he pushes non stop
[1:45:11] JayeLau: LOL
[1:45:11] pIasmate: how is that good
[1:45:16] Matteigh: you cannot explain to low tier...  they do not understand.. there is a reason they are low tier
[1:45:37] pIasmate: he gets ganked because he pushes
[1:45:52] MyckaT: honestly that 96 teemo plays like random gold player from eu
[1:45:53] 514484: yes but you want to push
[1:46:01] jordyutopia: i mean if you clear waves it doesnt matter if you die
[1:46:06] twitchsuckstoday: enemy investment on teemo is good
[1:46:09] 514484: you want plates, you want to be ganked so that your bot doesn't give 24 kills
[1:46:12] suppaahh: @ipav999 he thinks if  doesnt push, that means he doesnt die to tanks
[1:46:30] suppaahh: ganks
[1:46:33] suppaahh: *
[1:47:23] JayeLau: play for the KDA ipav. thats all the matters :D
[1:48:04] jordyutopia: the one complaining about dying by jungler is bad while clearing waves, can't watch baufs he's gonna pass out
[1:48:32] jordyutopia: bausffs
[1:48:33] pIasmate: yeah bausffs
[1:48:34] twitchsuckstoday: TheBaussffs
[1:48:50] pavel444: dyrus? OneHand
[1:49:23] JayeLau: rip
[1:49:28] pIasmate: might as well play tryn if you're just after turret gold then... teemo shouldn't play that way
[1:49:54] pikapika_666_: ZERO
[1:50:04] twitchsuckstoday: Cero
[1:50:09] pikapika_666_: COUNTLESS
[1:50:59] twitchsuckstoday: Teemo can't be himself without a teem
[1:51:11] pavel444: o
[1:51:13] jordyutopia: @pIasmate trynd playstyle is not hardpushing
[1:51:34] pIasmate: teemo can stall games out if you go malig shroom spam though
[1:51:46] pIasmate: and defend lanes while you farm sides
[1:52:21] Chris_Twitch: Better team wins
[1:52:54] 514484: he didn't dodge it
[1:53:00] pikapika_666_: micro envy
[1:53:05] jordyutopia: it is very hard to win with a losing team if you can't win 1v2 or even 1v3, and with teemo, that is very complicated
[1:55:34] sooydash: teemo jg is not working?
[1:56:45] JayeLau: @pIasmate yes cus teemo scales so well. you right
[1:57:28] pIasmate: so his team can farm up...
[1:58:25] jordyutopia: he should've jsut stayed invis and that was a big w
[2:05:17] VapoureX: whyd he hit that shroom twice without it taking damage?
[2:05:26] twitchsuckstoday: watching teemo laser the tower at 4x speed is satisfying to watch
[2:05:42] twitchsuckstoday: PEWPEWPEWPEW
[2:06:40] jordyutopia: KEKW
[2:06:56] twitchsuckstoday: Indirect teemo carry
[2:07:29] twitchsuckstoday: Trist was the van that carried the team, but teemo was the driver.
[2:08:47] pIasmate: remember when teemo could stack shrooms on one spot?
[2:16:37] pavel444: I see too.
[2:17:18] deanhkt: I’ve been having a lot of success with fleet tbh
[2:17:41] deanhkt: with swifties and celerity
[2:20:36] 514484: if even, champion is dogshit EZ
[2:21:01] deanhkt: I find that PTA needs attack speed boots but I much prefer swifties or spell pen boots
[2:21:19] jordyutopia: yeah for example vs jax you can not pick pta unless jax is bad
[2:23:03] twitchsuckstoday: you have passive to get pta going
[2:27:02] LetTheScoutCook: ipav = untara
[2:27:25] pIasmate: isn't nashors a bad item for a passive teemo then
[2:27:39] LetTheScoutCook: ye
[2:27:54] pIasmate: better to go full ap if you want scaling right
[2:27:59] LetTheScoutCook: nashor is extremely gold efficient but u have to use it..
[2:28:17] twitchsuckstoday: nashors is a core item. Its almost a must.
[2:28:32] deanhkt: full AP much better this season. I don’t build Nashors anymore
[2:29:03] LetTheScoutCook: i feel like top lane doesnt affect the outcome that much so u can straight up limit test every game and be ok
[2:29:04] deanhkt: fleet for lane and gathering storm for late
[2:29:36] LetTheScoutCook: pta nashor yolo and u climbin
[2:30:03] boownetz1: whats biggest teemo counter on top?
[2:30:38] deanhkt: vlad and ryze are nightmare match ups
[2:31:21] saintcoca: nasus
[2:31:29] twitchsuckstoday: malphite
[2:31:55] pIasmate: support is a more fun role for teemo
[2:32:10] LetTheScoutCook: malphite .. ur fav matchup
[2:32:30] jordyutopia: i always ban malphite, i don't even want to watch that guy on my games
[2:32:34] Chris_Twitch: that means go ap! LUL
[2:32:42] deanhkt: I don’t find Malph too bad tbh
[2:32:57] Chris_Twitch: i still remember the AD teemo from last week.. was soooo gud
[2:33:03] deanhkt: boring but u just gotta scale
[2:33:16] LetTheScoutCook: malph is extremely boring .. i rather lose lp than playing simplest sht in game
[2:33:37] pIasmate: manco tried teemo with kraken and guinsoo, did a surprising amount of damage
[2:33:54] LetTheScoutCook: nashor and kraken have gret synergy
[2:33:58] LetTheScoutCook: great
[2:34:11] deanhkt: I normally take cull into malph
[2:34:47] LetTheScoutCook: you are right.. u wont die but u wont deal any dmg :/

[2:45:08] jordyutopia: i love this tech
[2:45:49] TouchMyFish: takes a moment for the mushroom to arm itself then it can blow. Malph must've stepped away from it in time
[2:46:19] barbolarbo: mmm
[2:48:11] Lazynameross: KEKW
[2:48:53] jordyutopia: kayn wanted to gank

[3:20:33] marknytol: @ipav999 if they were to rework teemo, how would you have them do it. What would you hate them to change?
[3:21:25] Archathens: give him the yorick treatment, make him a new character Kappa
[3:22:06] marknytol: @Archathens i actually like new yorick he just weak but that just me maybe
