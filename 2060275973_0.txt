[1:40:56] piggietheone: yeah
[1:41:09] radh_: mluh
[1:41:11] Highlander84: the simple solution to AD leblanc is a negative AD ratio. if she builds AD she gets negative AP

[1:41:25] ChromaKhroma: @Highlander84 someone hire this person
[1:41:27] tharonfire: first of all, it's evident that riot has no idea what they are doing, so you can't blame them for it

[1:41:37] steelasaurix: Hi
[1:41:38] piggietheone: could it be possible she gets negative scaling off crit
[1:41:42] terranda_wisperwind: It kind of goes against our whole philosophy really
[1:41:51] piggietheone: like she buys crit her spell does less damage
[1:42:05] Light8430: @Quantum You're on to something, put it in Leblanc's lore she cannot handle shiv
[1:42:06] nuttyytft: ScaredCat

[1:42:26] RiotYelough: yeah thats like the opposite of what we want to promote - for 99% of players AD LB is a non-issue and we want to let players enjoy the item system - that said, we do nerf it to be shit
[1:42:29] radh_: isn´t that the same as mythic system
[1:42:31] Deathclaw1551: @nuttyytft plink Hai nuttyy

[1:43:36] Highlander84: @terranda_wisperwind no insult meant by this, but a philosophy that was arbitrarily set by people is only useful so long as it's useful. sticking to a philosophy just because that's what you've been doing doesn't make it good. these kinds of philosophies should be undergoing constant reevaluation to see if they comport with reality. if they don't they need to be jettisoned
