[5:24:12] KreeArraRS: any good build for taliyah to snowball?
[5:24:17] Mushroommeister: no :)
[5:24:20] Nightbot: Check out Pobelter's YouTube where he uploads highlights of his most exciting games and moments! https://www.youtube.com/user/Pobelt
[5:24:21] KrittyCat: And Collector can be gotten so much earlier in the game than Smolder's execute
[5:24:34] PrinceFuyuki: HUHH
[5:24:36] KrittyCat: Literally has to have a game go past like 35 minutes in most solo-q matches to get it
[5:24:41] Nightbot: https://discord.com/invite/SsnXFXxkVt hang with the hottest dudes and eat at the chillest restaurants in my stream community Discord
[5:24:44] DredgePhantom: @KrittyCat smolders execute is minimum 225 damage
[5:24:47] brandoniannn: @kreearrars ludens shadowflame then dcap void can slot in zhonya after shadowflame if you need and dont need pen
[5:24:58] DredgePhantom: and scales higher
[5:25:05] Admoon416: smolder's execute is more than double collector in a normal game it's way stronger
[5:25:07] KreeArraRS: @brandoniannn thank you mate
[5:25:09] Soviet1917: i think you need void
[5:25:10] brandoniannn: no prob
[5:25:13] KrittyCat: @DredgePhantom And he doesn't get it at its basic level until 30+ minutes
[5:25:18] flykick1260: Damn u are playing with the PDF file

[6:18:59] Yuzii007: Dogs can eat potatoes as long as they are plainly cooked and offered in moderation. Roasted potatoes, prepared without spices or butter are the best way to let your pet have a taste of a delicious spud. But avoid giving your dog raw or boiled potatoes as they're not safe for dogs to eat as they contain solanine.
