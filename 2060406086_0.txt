[2:36:07] giul_9: @pekinwoof do you like the idea behind Smolder's kit?
[2:36:08] Byrn_22: isnt it crazy that this champ needs 3 items and 225 stacks to even start dealing normal damage?
[2:36:20] Shcleepy: @Rose06012 ello rose fren peepoWave catJAM
[2:36:27] AntonyTLK1: stacks should make you flight E mor

[2:36:42] ryvvsaka: this skin looks really nice
[2:36:46] gobumblebees: maybe stacks should buff other abilities too
[2:36:47] Lucentex: his R should give stacks and at 325 the W should bounce like the Q
[2:36:50] Byrn_22: @bobnana7 rfc usually
[2:36:53] wx52: more flight time and speed on flap flap flap with stacks would be cool
[2:36:53] termisaal: karthus ult at 300 stacks
[2:36:56] umburrito21: i wish his stacks interacted more interestingly with the rest of his kit
[2:36:58] AntonyTLK1: IRELIAING
[2:36:58] Lazynameross: the stacks already buff all with magic dmg
[2:37:08] umburrito21: like w and e just get damage

[2:54:04] AntonyTLK1: @mddkyrone SNIFFA
[2:54:09] Shadic54321: they're fun :)
[2:54:22] Ardrana: swain w doesn't do damage to minions wither
[2:54:26] aeoti: maybe because tear start?
[2:54:38] glyndev: So that Yone can have a fighting chance. He needs all the help he can get after all
[2:54:39] gobumblebees: would you just farm out of vision if it did?
[2:54:48] curator_davies: it can go through them?
[2:54:48] AntonyTLK1: to not let him steal minions from other lanes idk
[2:54:49] termisaal: why tear tho?
[2:54:50] d_donkeys: Dude it's the range
[2:54:50] victorik: So you can't farm from complete safety
[2:54:51] Shcleepy: they gave the damage to yone
[2:54:51] Lazynameross: spam farming from literal miles away
[2:54:57] aburii_: Ask phreak
[2:54:59] mr_drapi: maybe to protect from stealing enemy buffs constantly?
[2:55:05] victorik: It was actually mentioned in Hwei /dev
[2:55:11] jeweledwasp: Cause he can farm pretty safely but the price is that it's harder for him to roam with less waveclear like many mages
[2:55:12] umburrito21: idk swain w makes more sense to me since its supposed to be a scouting/zoning tool but hwei qw not doing damage is so dumb
[2:55:17] d_donkeys: These abilities have so much range it would be unfair to clear the wave from such safety
[2:55:18] umburrito21: also nerf dorans shield i SAID IT
[2:55:19] sens_snakeman: why do you want your champ to be more broken when you're playing against a humble yone
[2:55:22] EdisonTheCat: its illegal for an ability to be able farm if its a safe distance from the yone champion.
[2:55:34] AntonyTLK1: Nerdge but monsters are coded like minions
[2:55:37] curator_davies: that would be weird tho
[2:55:39] Oreganeaux: @aburii_ he'd probably yell at you and call you stupid if you asked him anything\
[2:55:41] curator_davies: name one ability like that
[2:55:44] Shadic54321: cause yone can't farm safely mhm
