[1:15:14] kirbee___: hello gamers
[1:15:24] KdanDranzer: This Kayn shouldn't be jungling. Left both of his Solo Laners to get decimated by Karthus ganks but wants to flame

[1:17:28] Hide_on_Fishbones: what a phreak
[1:17:30] lavennoc: TFT was better than this. Rather take RNG over your Kayn teammate.
[1:18:07] Epiale: Jana Looked low
[1:18:16] KdanDranzer: Karthus got Janna with Qiyana after the ult
[1:18:21] KdanDranzer: Qiyana got it
[1:19:04] Covasertv: time to ff
[1:19:25] KdanDranzer: Sylas didn't even get to play the game

[1:22:27] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[1:22:29] KdanDranzer: @SippinNippis He waited to long to go in, gave Yi enough time to alpha strike and kill Wings
[1:22:41] KdanDranzer: Then because he did damage Yi last the kill went to him instead of to Wings
[1:23:35] KdanDranzer: He Q'd in with no Smite or Flash and just died for free over Grubs he couldn't steal
[1:23:44] WheresTheBaby: he easily could leave..
[1:23:57] Jauneofarc: He lost the grub to karthus q
[1:24:01] Jauneofarc: I cant
[1:24:55] xSoDarkCarver: the mid die 3 times in under 5 min, that's impressive.
[1:25:00] AiErain: that person doesnt even play kayn apprently
[1:25:04] AiErain: from what i see
[1:25:36] WheresTheBaby: rift i thought
[1:25:52] KdanDranzer: I love how Kayn is doing Grubs both times without Smite
[1:25:57] Semieza: Wtf
[1:26:02] Dtkaze: that's the play I was talking about lol
[1:26:09] Dtkaze: he could have just q'd out with the karthus kill and grubs
[1:26:15] Semieza: Literally inted it 2 times
[1:26:22] mehits: Damn the kayn has some nerve to have an ego
[1:26:27] Dtkaze: XD
[1:27:10] Dtkaze: And Riot says there's no losers queue
[1:27:20] iDeadWeight: Yo wings, you ever play yone top? Want to see your build if you do.

[1:27:34] Dtkaze: I wish they'd bring back Arena so I could be an arena player
[1:27:37] sergioosh12: definitely wise decision making from kayn
[1:27:50] VideoGameAfterlife: i wouldnt mind having my elo inflated to gold
[1:27:51] theamericanpugg: I lost brain cells rewatching that
[1:27:52] jocelotknee: That's me fr. I only play normal n aram
[1:28:04] HotSauceTester: kayn also a stat check elo inflated champ aswell

[1:29:48] mascot86: mascot86 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! gl in game
[1:29:58] VideoGameAfterlife: as long as your team doesnt suck balls a good blue kayn can do a lot
[1:30:59] Asuriuz: nothing wrong with some ball-sucktion Gayge
[1:31:15] HotSauceTester: would have been good to see how he got his 4 kills
[1:31:19] rainyyCS: also kayn ganking potential is insane
[1:31:25] HotSauceTester: or his other 3
[1:31:41] Ironicusx: Oh shit
[1:31:47] mehits: TF top new meta
[1:31:47] keshaluvr69: AP JAX TIME
[1:32:05] keshaluvr69: The best part about TF top is that people in silver are doing it
[1:32:06] keshaluvr69: love it
[1:32:08] rainyyCS: ye i mean as a champ that player was dogshit
[1:32:13] theamericanpugg: that Kayn probably eats cereal with a fork
[1:32:27] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[1:33:02] HotSauceTester: the new map top defo works in Kayn favour that side of the map sawell, just coming over the wall each time, id be abusing that

[1:34:40] syynth_sfx: yea TF in a long lane. doesnt seem like a good idea
[1:34:43] htraos: These copycats with no clue what they're doing are the cringiest
[1:34:44] OutRageousMe: into rumble
[1:34:51] host2s: rumble
[1:35:12] allertec: the 100T vs C9 game was a banger today
[1:36:21] TheOnionMaster: most of the pro toplaners are practicing it. but they dominate the lane with it, not get stomped to oblivion
[1:36:32] rainyyCS: late game jax vs late game yone ez for jax ?
[1:37:07] SurprizexAttk: they are all ad XD
[1:37:09] rocksandbeer: god this tf is in so much trouble

[1:37:36] KdanDranzer: So he's just gonna be useless for however long/short this game will be
[1:37:43] Sk00maPuma: TF is gunna name change over to broken brain
[1:38:52] rainyyCS: why they swap if yone cant farm either x d
[1:39:08] KdanDranzer: Because Yone isn't lvl 4 with no items

[3:39:58] Avab3ar: Minions and monsters that are large generate 1 stack, champions and epic monsters generate 2 stacks.
