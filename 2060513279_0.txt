[6:03:00] Mewfour_the_Fifth: I dont want to get skinnier, I want to get bigger and stronger but it's hard because getting big ends up in fat instead of muscle
[6:03:04] 蘑菇台灣: In theory yes
[6:03:12] 蘑菇台灣: In reality it aint feasable
[6:03:17] KrakOune: @rodolfort when i did it my fingers were hurting like crazy and it was the only thing preventing me from going to the top
[6:03:29] Loves_To_Spooge420: Do you dodge if they ban Yi ? no hate just generously curious

[6:05:08] Mewfour_the_Fifth: I want to get muscle but not get fat :( So I try to eat not too much but a bit more than I used to. Recently my right foot has started hurting while progressing squats, and I think it's because I'm not very flexible
[6:05:09] mista_trixter: @Cowsep so you recommend hitting the lifts instead of losing weight first ?
[6:05:45] uddertastic: you're so right cowsep

[6:09:02] mista_trixter: I want to start lifting but I don't know what to do at the gym if I were to go the thing I'm most afraid of is backpain
[6:09:03] RiskySeal: @giwrgos1293 gaining weight has been a problem for me for ever, even if if i eat a lot of surplus calories I basically dump it out in the next 6-8 hours LUL
[6:09:12] DIETTWEAK: drugs makes back no longer feelable
[6:09:22] JennZabba: @RiskySeal your thyroid works too good
[6:09:32] uddertastic: CAUGHTIN4K
[6:09:39] Mewfour_the_Fifth: Squatting hurts my foot :(
[6:09:44] giwrgos1293: @RiskySeal there are supplements to help u creating and muscle gainers are a key thing
[6:09:48] RUSH43EZW: squatting is fine but lunges leg extensions and leg curls is your bread and butter for building legs
[6:09:49] chilloriwill: only betas worry about injuries
[6:10:03] RiskySeal: @giwrgos1293 Okay, ill keep that in mind when i go to the store next time
[6:10:07] RUSH43EZW: as a certified personal trainer those are the big 3 you need to do to really grow your legs
[6:10:10] Maxiuxs: squating make me poop
[6:10:11] CantyBloke: ever consider trying to make a lifting instagram, i feel like lifting instagram might do better than a league one
[6:10:22] magnusuh: u do bench with barbells or dumbbels, personally pref dumbbels
[6:10:25] Mewfour_the_Fifth: from 60kg onwards I always feel my right foot hurt the next week
[6:10:26] mista_trixter: @Cowsep  I also have pain on my knees even when I sit on them
[6:10:30] RUSH43EZW: hammys
[6:10:30] DIETTWEAK: an injury is just your body nagging you ignore it
[6:10:32] xColdemort: Leg Press is BIS
[6:10:35] RUSH43EZW: and extension is quads
[6:10:52] canatica: did you get any flexibility after you started stretching your hamstrings? @Cowsep
[6:10:53] RUSH43EZW: leg press is c tier
[6:11:36] RUSH43EZW: i can send you some exercises that will strenghten your flexibility and knees
[6:11:37] wabitgirl: Dude, you should do some yoga classes
[6:11:39] nisoteric34: tight? araara
[6:11:43] giwrgos1293: @RiskySeal before u buy creatine u need to know that before u buy creatinge u should contact a doctor to do some bloodwork to see if ur kidneys are working properlyy because if u take creatine with kidney problems it might make them worse
[6:11:52] canatica: @wabitgirl isnt that for girls?
[6:11:56] MiloSucksTV: How young are you? @Cowsep
[6:11:58] wabitgirl: Pilates are thoroughly meh-tier. Yoga is much more effective
[6:12:11] wabitgirl: @canatica ...what?
[6:12:15] mista_trixter: I feel yoga is just some BS
[6:12:18] wabitgirl: canatica you poor, sad, tight person
[6:12:25] wabitgirl: mista_trixter then you ain't doin it right
[6:12:34] giwrgos1293: vitamin d defficiiency
[6:12:37] RUSH43EZW: you gotta roll the fuck out with a foam pad @Cowsep
[6:12:41] RUSH43EZW: that and fish oil
[6:12:43] RUSH43EZW: again
[6:12:44] mista_trixter: @wabitgirl never tried it but it's just what it looks like to me
[6:12:46] MiloSucksTV: I can't sit on my knees like the seamstress position or whatever
[6:12:50] MiloSucksTV: It hurts so bad
[6:12:59] wabitgirl: mista_trixter lmaoooo yeah, no, it's fucking lit.
[6:13:00] RUSH43EZW: as someone whos in the gym 20 hours a week i do this shit for a living i dont know best but i know close to it @Cowsep yeah
[6:13:01] Aldoz: probably trynda didnt press r
[6:13:09] TnFedi98: love your hairline @Cowsep
[6:13:12] Schurke03: vit d fish oil and stretch
[6:13:19] uddertastic: NOTED uh huh
[6:13:26] xColdemort: get 10k steps bro
[6:13:30] jerlojeb: u did stretching did it help?
[6:13:38] RUSH43EZW: order omega fish oil on amazon and take it once a day and roll out with a pad @Cowsep thats all u rly need to do
[6:13:44] RUSH43EZW: then it will gradually get better
[6:13:47] MiloSucksTV: Don't you think it would be good getting into stretching? @Cowsep
[6:13:55] Aldoz: I always worked on my legs, I have so poor upper body strength, my mom can probably out muscle me
[6:14:00] wabitgirl: mista_trixter pairing yoga with any kind of strength training basically doubles your gains. Flexible strength is SO much more effective than tight strength
[6:14:06] MiloSucksTV: Might be able to do more stuff at the gym too
[6:14:13] CantyBloke: i feel like at one time during a stretch phase your were displaying pretty decent flexibility
[6:14:22] StreamElements: cowcat

[6:15:42] CantyBloke: yeah league is the background noise for whatever the chat and cowsep are talking about FeelsGoodMan
[6:15:44] DIETTWEAK: @RUSH43EZW dude people online come from all walks of life hell many of us likely dont even play league anymore

[6:17:06] uddertastic: What you gonna do about it Stare
[6:17:13] RUSH43EZW: what part of your right foot ?
[6:17:25] Mewfour_the_Fifth: the top part of the food, around the middle
[6:17:29] 67se: @RUSH43EZW his "right foot" dumas
[6:17:32] balint19072002: why your firdt item titan?and why  max s 2.?

[6:17:59] balint19072002: why sour firet item titan and why max w?
[6:18:03] DIETTWEAK: maybe you broke that foot as a kid
[6:18:13] Mewfour_the_Fifth: no, I only ever broke my arm
[6:18:16] RUSH43EZW: @67se hey i know you are a league player but i am asking him what part of his foot ya know ? there is the heel the arch the toes etc
[6:18:20] RUSH43EZW: its ok to be pea brain !
[6:18:22] 67se: maybe his foot don't work lol
[6:18:39] Aldoz: did you ever consider playing a different champ than Yi
[6:18:45] efectivnuamgasitaltnume: and why guinsoo second item
[6:19:05] MigSlayer: I think that mostly starts when eating too much overprocessed low quality food
[6:19:05] cuongdoan: @RUSH43EZW how big is your cock
[6:19:13] MigSlayer: which is so many things on shelves xdd
[6:19:18] nisoteric34: xdd
[6:19:29] MiloSucksTV: How often do you go to the gym? feel like it's a very good idea going to the gym/staying active when you're 30+ @Cowsep
[6:19:37] CantyBloke: KEKW
[6:19:39] Aldoz: oof
[6:19:44] BagboyBrown: wait hol up when did rift get a reskin? :O
[6:19:45] nisoteric34: same i think
[6:20:02] LookAtMyNAEM: Just took a sloppy shit
[6:20:14] nisoteric34: @LookAtMyNAEM damn how was it?
[6:20:16] Aldoz: Yeah, dont stop streching before your 30s kids
[6:20:19] Aldoz: thats when you need it
[6:20:29] cuongdoan: cowsep works out his eyeballs at the gym
[6:20:31] xExuberantx: Home gym is where its at
[6:20:34] chilloriwill: distance is half the training
[6:20:37] MiloSucksTV: You could buy some weights and start at home! @Cowsep
[6:20:41] xExuberantx: A bar, couple of db and you can do a lot
[6:20:48] MiloSucksTV: yeeee
[6:20:48] LookAtMyNAEM: @nisoteric34 I got in the bath afterwards and realized I didn't wipe properly
[6:20:53] uddertastic: hyperLick

[6:21:05] nisoteric34: Hmm
[6:21:11] nisoteric34: hyperLick
[6:21:14] RUSH43EZW: @Aldoz isnt wrong i am 21 and havent stretched consistently for the last few years since rugby in highschool and am feeling the downsides of it every other weewk
[6:21:23] teabox03: The fact that u gotta go to gym enough to demotivate me
[6:21:26] GaboTurbo: usually if you get bored, just get heavier weights
[6:21:26] MiloSucksTV: I do prefer the gym too, it's so much nicer with all the machines. It's like going to the office, you get in the right mindset
[6:21:35] cuongdoan: @RUSH43EZW can you share your stack
[6:21:53] e1usiv: sounds like you don’t have your health high enough on the priority list my man
[6:21:55] ZackFairX: @Cowsep can't you just do some light exercises when watching something?
[6:21:58] Aldoz: @RUSH43EZW well if you're playing sports or exercising you definetely need to stretch lol
[6:22:29] RUSH43EZW: and @Cowsep it isnt complex just do 3 or 4 different exercises per muscle group 2x a week walk incline on a treadmill 20 mins a day and hit a set of abs and 90% of your foods should be whole . only have a cheat meal a week . do that for 6 months and you will literally be in the best shape of your life
[6:22:39] RUSH43EZW: the recipie is simple alot of people just dont like to cook

[6:23:12] LiterallyNoSkill: does cowsep still play street fighter or no more?
[6:23:17] ShionSinX: -1
[6:23:37] RUSH43EZW: walking incline will nnot only help with knee pain but it also burns substansial calories and also keeps your heartrate a tad lower then running which negates a larger muscle loss @Cowsep
[6:23:54] RUSH43EZW: so you hold onto more muscle mass and burn more fat
[6:24:12] Rossetti19: the legend himself what's up buddy
[6:24:12] xExuberantx: @RUSH43EZW my only problem with walking incline are shin spltis sometimes
[6:24:16] vickyf5124: spin for shin
[6:24:31] 蘑菇台灣: have you tried korean delicacy like raw stingray liver before?@ cowsep
[6:24:34] hyphymike2: explain like im 5 how walking on an incline would help knee pain
[6:24:40] uddertastic: HUH
[6:24:51] RUSH43EZW: @xExuberantx shin splint are temporary just keep it consistent and it will go away with time
[6:24:53] Rossetti19: looking fresh my guy
[6:24:56] ShionSinX: 2 items, taking enemy base
[6:24:58] canatica: would you go to a yoga class of full women? @Cowsep
[6:25:02] RUSH43EZW: a calorie deficet for sure would help as well
[6:25:06] nisoteric34: only tiktok? Sure
[6:25:11] LookAtMyNAEM: @wabitgirl does downwid dog with peanut butter help
[6:25:17] Huassassin: GIGACHAD
[6:25:19] ThreshReceptacle: TikTok? I think you're catching yourself on /r/furry ;)
[6:25:20] canatica: how did that feel?
[6:25:26] xExuberantx: @RUSH43EZW I know, it's annoying when it happens
[6:25:43] Aldoz: We're literally gonna turn into the humans from Wall-E fr
[6:25:46] CantyBloke: KEKW
[6:25:47] 蘑菇台灣: i watch mukbangs on youtube that really made me wanna try raw liver and fish liver sashime
[6:26:18] RUSH43EZW: @hyphymike2 retro walking improved gait and muscle strength in people with knee osteoarthritis in multiple studies . professional athletes do it in every single assosiation
[6:26:19] chilloriwill: You thinking of "Idiocracy" Aldoz? Qo
[6:26:20] SaiPresh: Frozen heart not better?
[6:26:25] chilloriwill: Thats the future xD
[6:26:33] MiloSucksTV: What language do people speak on your server? @Cowsep
[6:26:33] nisoteric34: see ya cowsep i dont think i can last another 1 hour and 30 min NotCrying

[7:25:27] 67se: noice
[7:25:32] duyiiiii: zhonyas
[7:25:33] vickyf5124: @Zeth_y looking into it, twitch uses x264 encoding, but youtube uses hardware acceleration for h264, which has a lower quality and requires about double the bitrate to have equal quality. Twitch limit is 6 mbit, youtube is 12 mbit for 1080p60, which is about equal quality. Youtube wins when using AV1, but that requires really new hardware to be viable
[7:25:37] duyiiiii: meditate vs zhonyas
[7:25:53] duyiiiii: no im blind Clueless
[7:25:56] poepkonijntje69: meditate max is the new meta?
