[0:07:55] Phoen1xChan: Im kinda curious. What do you think about not being able to curse on cast? Im not saying you should curse every sentence, but is the average viewer really that young?

[0:30:19] sp4cebart: nah even people in gold can see that nowadays
[0:30:20] PerilousKoala: Bronze here, that makes sense.
[0:30:22] sp4cebart: well, some of them
[0:31:02] sp4cebart: if someone manages to die on ez 11 times they shouldn't pick adc at all IMO

[0:48:57] moony_jpg: cute
[0:49:13] Airfire: I have seen him many times over the years. My dad and I try and see him on every tour. He was introduced to us by our Godmother, who unfortunately lives way too far away so I only get to see her once or maybe twice a year

[0:50:00] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:50:20] moony_jpg: i mean, there is that scene in sherlock where he says something along the lines of "marriage is two people who already live together throw a party and then go back to living together"
[0:50:51] moony_jpg: i know a few people who just don't like all that attention on themselves that a wedding would bring

[0:59:38] Squallly: @ZuvaStyle oh goodness, the prospect of baby medic is a cuteness overload too far
[1:00:30] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a €500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[1:00:49] moony_jpg: the one thing i don't like about this song is how awkwardly it's cut off
[1:00:53] chocotreatg: we want cat though

[1:04:57] Squallly: yeah, the g2-bds series was a bit of an anti-climax - but i did enjoy the macro on show in g1
[1:05:54] pomnz: AD Shyv always has low key higher wr, but AP is  more popular no?
[1:08:51] Airfire: the comet smoulder is an interesting choice

[1:11:43] jucchanUwU: panth threw as many r's bot as he did q's top
[1:12:48] Squallly: height diff? :p
[1:14:14] jucchanUwU: unless this game goes for at least another 20 min i dont think theres enough time to really outscale

[1:35:10] jammy_pineapple: I think they should really cut the picking time down
[1:35:11] ycelpt: Morning Medic. Congratulations for your engagement!
[1:35:18] jammy_pineapple: the picking phase takes forever
[1:35:26] LUCYXZ1337: @Squallly sometimes I have to write something on paper and if someone sees it and says "no wonder you only type on your pc"

[1:52:13] LUCYXZ1337: ah yes the bishop christening gambit
[1:52:14] ZuvaStyle: sofieJAM
[1:52:21] jucchanUwU: @MrPosh1909 we need chess move names
[1:52:41] Auris_: i like the Mongolian butt twirl defence move
[1:52:52] LUCYXZ1337: tbh there is a thing called the pterodactyl variation, hyper accelerated dragon opening
[1:53:02] MrPosh1909: jucchanUwU uhhh. The Rook Looping
[1:53:05] SCRAAATCH: The small piece was surrounded by black ones, I've seen this somewhere before
[1:53:07] Squallly: i think this one is like 600-899
[1:53:14] MrPosh1909: Bishop Dance
[1:53:40] LUCYXZ1337: they are obviously dragons Medic
[1:53:47] LUCYXZ1337: it is the hyper accelerated dragon after all
[1:53:53] Pamoth: You also cant hear them when they go to the toilet as they have a silent P xdd

[1:54:45] Barushko: Zero f*ing clue
[1:54:47] PartialPatrick: We was the same yt short
[1:54:48] StabbySausage: helico and pter
[1:54:48] mynci: pter for flight and helico for spiral
[1:54:52] PartialPatrick: saw*
[1:55:04] Just_a_PixeI: Medic called me smart medicNice
[1:55:09] NorcastZ: should it be pronouced helitopter then Hmm
[1:55:14] LUCYXZ1337: i only know because of helicographs
[1:55:19] Jazzgar: ornitho-pter
[1:55:22] seoulcalibre: roflmaopter
[1:55:25] clemmmmmm: wouldnt roflcopter be a compound between rofl and helicopter?
[1:55:28] Shadewfire: why is the p silent in pterodactyl and not helicopter?
[1:55:30] proxhimo: roflico-ter
[1:55:30] NorcastZ: or helicoter
[1:55:34] psblo21242: so pterodactyl is flying dactyle
[1:55:38] SCRAAATCH: Pterodactyls may not be dinosaurs but they ARE the worst example for spelling the letter P over the phone.
[1:55:40] Capsizetft: Ornithopte
[1:55:42] LUCYXZ1337: r/pterexplainthejoke
[1:55:52] Pamoth: You cant hear Pterodactyl when they go to the toilet as they have a silent P xdd
[1:55:59] Mysticflyr: when a hipster orders a coffee in spain they have a hard time after "yo, soy latte" the barista just thinks they are being philosophical.
[1:56:06] PawDK: if you P in the middle, people get mad
[1:56:14] NorcastZ: @Pamoth what if they take a huge shit?
[1:56:39] Pamoth: @Pamoth Depends how high they are flying

[1:58:44] StabbySausage: chat how open is medic about his bisexuality
[1:59:03] jucchanUwU: did they push up or wasnt the wave just already there from the first fight?
[1:59:19] LUCYXZ1337: @StabbySausage considering his grindr profile is public Kappa
[1:59:20] SCRAAATCH: I mean, that still counts. But it's up to you how you identify.
[1:59:27] Pamoth: Its gay to not be attracted to men sometimes
[1:59:30] StabbySausage: jesus that was mature LUL thanks
[1:59:36] IMVbg: tbh some male celebrities are BOOBA
[2:00:00] callum950: Congratulations on your engagement Medic!
[2:00:04] ZuvaStyle: Gender & Sexuality are spectrums, so whatever makes you comfy is fine & dandy
[2:00:30] StreamElements: Oh yes, please give me subby wubbies, feels yummy in my tummy.
[2:00:36] justsomeguy36: wait I thought cis was about gender identity not sexuality?
[2:00:37] Sandrian: Finding someone attractive and wanting an adult relationship with said person are two completely different things tho
[2:00:45] StabbySausage: tbh I was confused because of how I saw you sitting KEKW
[2:00:46] YaBoiDreamy: Morning Medic and Chat <3
[2:01:00] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[2:01:09] psblo21242: chat what song is that?
[2:01:24] LUCYXZ1337: chat yall too smart about this tbh
[2:01:26] SCRAAATCH: Yeah, cis = gender expression
[2:01:27] ZuvaStyle: Cis as in Cisgender
[2:01:32] StabbySausage: @justsomeguy36 it is, I presume he meant "mostly hetero"
[2:01:36] antoniusbjorn: Legendary @psblo21242
[2:01:38] natashaxmorgana: Cis-het is gender + sexuality. Cis is just gender
[2:01:44] stinodes: isnt the s in cis straight?
[2:01:44] psblo21242: @antoniusbjorn ty
[2:01:50] doriava: Legendary by welshly arms
[2:01:55] MosseyEU: cis is comfortable in skin i believe
[2:02:05] SCRAAATCH: @stinodes Cis isn't an acronym lol. Just stands for cisgender.
[2:02:07] ZuvaStyle: CLEAN
[2:02:08] natashaxmorgana: @stinodes No it's derived from latin. I'm a bi but I'm still cis.
[2:02:11] BubblyButtBob: clean
[2:02:14] LUCYXZ1337: STRAIGHT
[2:02:21] StabbySausage: @LUCYXZ1337 you basically called it
[2:02:32] Pamoth: Cis is the female counterpart to bro isnt it? xdd
[2:02:40] magicfinbow: all shades of grey
[2:02:40] stinodes: @natashaxmorgana oh ok
[2:02:46] LUCYXZ1337: i am so out of depth on this topic
[2:02:51] stinodes: learn everyday i g
[2:02:56] LUCYXZ1337: but I am from a conservative country so
[2:03:00] natashaxmorgana: Cis isn't comfortable in skin - that's a misconception / people assigning it an acronym. It's not one. It's derived from another language just as trans is
[2:03:12] ZuvaStyle: Y'all got most of it down LUL
[2:03:20] r1vah: wow janna bait them KEKW
[2:03:36] IMVbg: Pog

[2:03:38] NLSlimShady: that dmg
[2:03:40] Scarf1991: PogBones
[2:03:40] ElusiveFRZ: iunno. I personally find a lot of women (and men) very attractive but I don't want to sleep with them. I just consider that they are beautiful by my standards.
[2:03:41] StabbySausage: that turn wtf
[2:03:43] ZuvaStyle: The chat vibes rn is "They're a little confused but they got the spirit"
[2:04:00] natashaxmorgana: @ZuvaStyle Lmao true
[2:04:02] Pamoth: @MedicCasts You listened to Teddy Swims?
[2:04:08] LUCYXZ1337: this whole album is a fucking banger
[2:04:10] Sandrian: As long as we're staying respectful
[2:04:20] YaBoiDreamy: @ElusiveFRZ thats very based
[2:04:21] FrostSJ: Respectful is the name of the game
[2:04:26] BubblyButtBob: are you casting lec tonight?
[2:04:28] m3pp0_: @ElusiveFRZ bases.
[2:04:32] m3pp0_: based*
[2:04:36] ZuvaStyle: I mean, I'm a trans lesbian and I feel very much comfortable and welcome here sofiePride
[2:04:39] DonRaynor: honestly this whole stream has had only bangers on the soundtrack
[2:04:45] natashaxmorgana: I think it's really hard to get all of it right unless you exist in LGBTQ+ communities. The people who are trying to help but aren't quite right, are at least trying to be accepting and learn about this stuff
[2:04:47] IMVbg: VIT vs MAD and SK vs FNC who wins chat?
[2:05:01] DonRaynor: @IMVbg MAD FNC wins
[2:05:05] NLSlimShady: Vit and Fnc
[2:05:06] Pamoth: Teddy Swims is a powerhouse - His vibe would totally fit your stream
[2:05:07] tayleport: mdk and fnc
[2:05:15] gerciufan1: vit eats mad for sure
[2:05:16] knightrider1818: Hey, saw your tweet for the proposal but finally caught live, all the best for your journey ahead and congrats <3
[2:05:17] IMVbg: VIT clears MAD
[2:05:22] 2gooden: @imvbg MAD & FNC
[2:05:49] hitsujikoujou: Im not straight but I never felt like I needed to identify as anything.
[2:06:03] KiraisGod: looks like silver
[2:06:05] StabbySausage: Gold
[2:06:19] natashaxmorgana: Misses one skillshot after hitting 13 in succession on CD: "I'm so bad"
[2:06:21] WeakestYugopnikEnjoyer: nah, Yasuo movement too clean for plat
[2:06:26] StabbySausage: the support has 75% KP that's not silver KEKW
[2:06:27] bushwookies: i say silver rankdle xdd
[2:06:52] tayleport: yeh they did
[2:07:15] justsomeguy36: less nerfed for melees I think?
[2:07:18] ZuvaStyle: can you change which support item you have later on?
[2:07:32] tayleport: i do think its bad that champs like leo and naut still go bloodsong
[2:07:41] natashaxmorgana: @ZuvaStyle If you sell and rebuy it but you take the - gold for doing so
[2:07:49] ZuvaStyle: @ZuvaStyle gotcha
[2:07:50] SCRAAATCH: @ZuvaStyle If you sell your first completed support item you can buy the others. You lose like 130g int he process IIRC, something like that
[2:08:07] natashaxmorgana: Support item costs 400, sells for 180, 220g for swapsies
[2:08:12] r1vah: catJAM
[2:08:15] ZuvaStyle: Okay that's not too bad, but yeah probably wanna avoid doing it
[2:08:19] DonRaynor: I find this stream very dangerous. I feel like creating a parasocial relationship with Medic would be extremely easy.
[2:08:21] ZuvaStyle: catJAM
[2:08:31] ElusiveFRZ: @natashaxmorgana so let me ask you this: a lot of the message around non-hetero sexuality is about "love is love", people are free to love whoever they want. So if someone identifies as bi but has never fallen in love or had a crush on a member of a particular gender but engaged in sexual relations, is that still considered on that spectrum or is sexuality about sex?
[2:08:33] Shadewfire: xdding
[2:08:34] DonRaynor: catJAM
[2:08:47] ForgettD: xdding PianoTime
[2:08:56] ForgettD: scrapiLove
[2:09:01] StabbySausage: @DonRaynor if he wasn't extremely charismatic you probably wouldn't have seen him cast something so that kinda tracks
[2:09:02] Scarf1991: acquaintances at most
[2:09:08] r1vah: xdding YEP im just here to listen while im playing xdd
[2:09:11] sapu_123: to me you are my best friend @MedicCasts PepeHands Kapp
[2:09:11] knightrider1818: xdding
[2:09:20] SCRAAATCH: @natashaxmorgana Consider the existence of asexuality, which is still a sexual orientation despite not involving sex at all.
[2:09:31] wuddlin: are the rats homeless today
[2:09:32] ikki_lsa: i was confused why tf u were playing rell all of a sudden and then its just the skin
[2:09:32] jucchanUwU: parasocial isnt inherently bad
[2:09:33] purebread29: its just a club ngl
[2:09:35] DonRaynor: ye, makes sense. its just something I try to keep myself aaware of, so that I don't fall into that trap
[2:09:46] Chrylian: We here being respectful of Medic's boundaries and enjoying his stream
[2:09:46] hitsujikoujou: How wil you sell your onlyfans?
[2:09:48] DonRaynor: @DonRaynor an excelent point too
[2:10:00] 2gooden: @mediccasts congrats on the proposal my guy! Glad to have you back on the LEC
[2:10:02] sapu_123: guys, my best friend just told me I'm just a guy in a bar to him BibleThump
[2:10:09] Sandrian: Does this mean the blob isn't invited to te wedding? I'm heartbroken Medic (/sarcasm)
[2:10:09] a920123_: Gotta pay for the honeymoon LUL
[2:10:12] Barushko: It's a bit different than that, you're asomewhat "public" personality, and we've seen you  develop over the years etc. The relationship is asymetrical in a way
[2:10:12] FrostSJ: @hitsujikoujou Lmao
[2:10:21] wuddlin: is the wedding this year
[2:10:33] BubblyButtBob: are you casting tonight?
[2:10:41] Scarf1991: he'll do an onlyfans livestream where every time he dies he takes off an item of clothing Kappa
[2:10:44] LUCYXZ1337: i know you medic
[2:10:48] LUCYXZ1337: you died when you cut your hair
[2:11:00] Scarf1991: catJAM
[2:11:02] Barushko: Definitely yeah
[2:11:02] bladetrinity16: meow, i just wanna say i hope you have a good stream and day medic :3
[2:11:03] DonRaynor: @Barushko and parasociality forms if we think we know the private side, and we think Medic knows us as well.
[2:11:09] saltire_sco: Can anyone explain why people would use he/theirs or they/hers? Not part of the community and never had the chance to ask
[2:11:17] jammy_pineapple: I think people also develop parasocial relationships when they have lacking relationships in their life
[2:11:25] natashaxmorgana: @ElusiveFRZ Sexuality is about who you are attracted to. If you are romantically/emotionally as well as physically attracted to the opposite gender and only physically attracted to the same gender, you can identify as bi. You can identify as whatever you want really. Labels exist to express how you feel in this society. I actually think labels for sexuality are kind of pointless because in the majority of spaces, they're not respected
[2:11:27] jammy_pineapple: trying to fill a void as it were
[2:11:35] r1vah: KEKW
[2:11:38] ikki_lsa: stream is whatever but if u watch someones podcast so much or edit one u develop such a parasocial relationship with them its insane
[2:11:42] NLSlimShady: thats quite the target selection masterclass by yasuo
[2:11:50] zajchyy: no frozen heart this game?
[2:11:51] ElusiveFRZ: @natashaxmorgana define attraction tho
[2:11:51] natashaxmorgana: @ElusiveFRZ if you are more "love is love" and depends on meeting the right person - you may feel more fitted to "pansexual"
[2:11:55] BubblyButtBob: 30 kills in 17 min
[2:12:00] StreamElements: Follow me over on twitter: https://twitter.com/MedicCasts or instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mediccasts/ ! Or even catch up with my latest youtube videos on https://www.youtube.com/c/mediccasts
[2:12:01] Barushko: @Barushko Indeed!
[2:12:02] wuddlin: whats happening i just joined chat monkaW
[2:12:18] natashaxmorgana: @ElusiveFRZ Differentiate between admiration and attraction and you'll be about right
[2:12:20] MauZaum: What elo is this, roughly?
[2:12:21] LoLRankBot: Medic is Diamond I 0 LP  | Altaccount is Platinum II 36 LP
[2:12:23] 2gooden: @saltire_sco gender is a spectrum and some people belong in that section which is in between male & non-binary or female & non-binary. They’re happy with being called either pronoun
[2:12:34] DonRaynor: @saltire_sco Gendered pronouns are the issue, they don't relate to them well, so they try to find the form that fits.
[2:12:35] Sandrian: It's a see champion kill champion game
[2:12:36] StabbySausage: @wuddlin in chat or in the 46 kill game? LUL
[2:12:40] Sandrian: Very bloody
[2:12:44] Barushko: @saltire_sco Because they feel like doing so in order to be more inclusive. It's up to you or anyone involved
[2:12:47] knightrider1818: Came here for the caster, staying here for the streamer, Your stream is calming and peaceful !
[2:13:02] Caesarbot: qxdd
[2:13:06] Pamoth: Yellowstar
[2:13:07] NLSlimShady: monkaSTEER
[2:13:08] SCRAAATCH: @ElusiveFRZ In those spaces it can be helpful to have labels, because it's like knowing which banner you're flying into battle.
[2:13:23] DonRaynor: @2gooden then there's me, a person who's mother tongue is non gendered, so I misgender ewverything by accident. including myself.
[2:13:29] Scarf1991: brucegRIP2
[2:13:34] Sandrian: Wukon just abandoning you like that RIP
[2:13:37] saltire_sco: @DonRaynor I see it on work emails from some people and want to be respectful. Thanks chat
[2:14:18] tayleport: i label my self as a capital g Gsmer
[2:14:19] tayleport: gamer
[2:14:36] Pamoth: But do you label your label maker?
[2:14:41] DonRaynor: @DonRaynor you can ask them, that is okay, as long as you do it repectfully, like you did here.
[2:14:45] Sandrian: I wanted a labelmaker so bad as a kid haha
[2:14:49] wuddlin: i label my hoodies for each day
[2:14:49] magicfinbow: tax disc
[2:14:49] jucchanUwU: @Pamoth of course thats what its for
[2:14:51] 2gooden: @donraynor everyone makes mistakes and as long as you’re open to learning over time don’t stress about it! Being bilingual isn’t easy haha
[2:14:52] Sandrian: Looked like the ultimate toy
[2:14:53] magicfinbow: good lord what decade are we in
[2:14:56] PawDK: casual fraud NODDERS
[2:14:56] ZuvaStyle: Now I want a labelmaker LUL
[2:15:00] StreamElements: Want to stay up to date with all things Team BDS? You can find all their socials over here: https://linktr.ee/TeamBDS medicNoted
[2:15:05] StabbySausage: @saltire_sco are you a native english speaker? because "everyone is being asked to clean their table" is also used in english for the neutral way to talk about everyone in singular
[2:15:18] ZuvaStyle: Just print out a tag saying "very gay" and stick it on my forehead
[2:15:21] Scarf1991: reporting you to the joke police as we speak
[2:15:42] magicfinbow: damn i wanted to keep wearing my flapper skirt
[2:15:45] ElusiveFRZ: @natashaxmorgana ehh I'm not sure about that. I think Angelina Jolie is one of the hottest women in the world.. but I don't necessarily admire her, want to sleep with her, or even want a relationship. I also think Henry Cavill is one of the hottest men in the world but hell yeah I'd be down with spending time with him.
[2:15:55] jucchanUwU: the roaring 20s is the 1900s, this one is the pogging 20s
[2:16:01] ZuvaStyle: YES
[2:16:02] LUCYXZ1337: we had glowing bracelets
[2:16:09] LUCYXZ1337: (couple years ago I am 25)
[2:16:15] ZuvaStyle: Labelmaker parties, make it happen, PLEASE
[2:16:16] wuddlin: travis kelce is straight?
[2:16:16] hitsujikoujou: Time to take this out of context.
[2:16:21] saltire_sco: @StabbySausage I am yes, which is why I never understand why some people go in a rage when someone uses "they/them" because it's literally in the english language
[2:16:26] HermaineCocaine: There is something fruity about Taylor Swift being your SO
[2:16:47] jucchanUwU: its all a cover
[2:16:55] Faylea: true
[2:17:09] magicfinbow: that biden tweet was fire
[2:17:11] koponenjn: Idk Taylor is more pop than country now
[2:17:13] 2gooden: facts there’s some irony in there haha
[2:17:14] LUCYXZ1337: we live in the era of presidents tweeting memes
[2:17:15] ElusiveFRZ: that some deep state infiltration going on there
[2:17:17] LUCYXZ1337: you cannot make this shit up
[2:17:19] Pamoth: That Biden tweet was fucking perfect
[2:17:28] SCRAAATCH: That entire thing is hilarious. Hating someone because she was shown DURING THE FOOTBALL
[2:17:30] DonRaynor: if I add carbon to irony, do I make steel?
[2:17:39] PawDK: @StabbySausage its a world view thing. They care because you are challenging the world they know and understand, labeling your identity as nonsense because they don't understand it... kind of like old people and smart phones
[2:17:49] magicfinbow: i love their change of direction past few months to just straight up attacking and memeing
[2:17:56] LUCYXZ1337: @DonRaynor steely
[2:17:56] Jazzgar: finally we're having the real discussion. let me get my gucci tinfoil hat
[2:17:59] Sandrian: @LUCYXZ1337 We also live in an era where presidential candidates are very willing to break NATO treaty as a topic for their candidacy. The world is a weird place.
[2:18:10] ZuvaStyle: Every time you get an endgame like that, I just think of the Bricky video of "HIT. THE GODDAMN. NEXUS!"
[2:18:20] LUCYXZ1337: Tbf chat I am European I don't share your weirdness
[2:18:33] HermaineCocaine: The rise of populism
[2:18:40] natashaxmorgana: @ElusiveFRZ If you can't even imagine like... making out with a woman then you're probably more straight/gay (depending on your gender identity) with a strong appreciation for beauty and acceptance for those with differing sexual orientations - based off the limited insight you've given me. (and your description of Angelina Jolie does fit more admiration than attraction)
[2:18:42] Sandrian: Pretty sure most people in chat are European
[2:18:46] 2gooden: us vs them works veryyyyy well with social media. it’s sad
[2:18:51] natashaxmorgana: Not admiration of the person but admiration of the beauty
[2:19:12] ElusiveFRZ: @natashaxmorgana thats a good way to define it
[2:19:17] jucchanUwU: hate/fear mongering is so meta it needs nerf pls riot
[2:19:22] PawDK: art! rooAww
[2:19:38] StabbySausage: Rupeblicen
[2:19:42] DonRaynor: We had Presidental elections yesturday (in Finland) we ended up with the young oppoturnist libertarian over an older gay gentleman, but it ended up with 51/49 split, when we expected 60/40 I'm quite happy how close it was
[2:19:46] crispytain: ms paint pogg another masterpiece incoming
[2:19:50] natashaxmorgana: @ElusiveFRZ Think of it like admiring a nice sunset, it seems like that's what you do with beautiful women - doesn't have to be omg i wanna be her kinda thing
[2:20:00] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[2:20:08] Pamoth: Your telling me that Political views are not on a spectrum? Time to get the label maker out!
[2:20:20] ElusiveFRZ: @natashaxmorgana tbf I have that same level of appreciation for some men as well
[2:21:04] WeakestYugopnikEnjoyer: Genocide Joe looks like a literal mummy and that's all that matters for the average voter who doesn't follow politics
[2:21:06] Pamoth: Republicans need to get the label maker out SMH
[2:21:09] Sandrian: @Pamoth not in the US, other countries different story ;)
[2:21:18] MageInRed: Republicans are literally the sith from Star Wars
[2:21:18] StabbySausage: it also has something to do with conservatism being on the same personality spectrum as conformity
[2:21:28] natashaxmorgana: @ElusiveFRZ That's natural, so the question when it comes to your sexuality would just be who you wanna bone or make out with or whatever
[2:21:32] SCRAAATCH: Yeah, Republicans are REALLY fervent in their "our people always do the right and better thing" beliefs. It's jarring.
[2:21:47] Pamoth: @Pamoth I need to pay more attention to politics tbf.
[2:22:01] tayleport: @Pamoth nah not really
[2:22:24] ElusiveFRZ: The thing is, many "moderates" or conservatives have left the Republican party, or no longer identify as Republican.   Republicans have now self-selected to be part of the in-group while all others who consider themselves traditionally conservative will vote Republican but don't consider themselves members of the party
[2:22:38] LUCYXZ1337: if that's a 5 I am mariah carrey
[2:22:48] StabbySausage: @WeakestYugopnikEnjoyer I can't tell if your comment was in favor of Biden or completely against
[2:22:53] DonRaynor: @WeakestYugopnikEnjoyer yet TJD is about 2 years younger and just tanned overweight version of mummy
[2:23:15] wuddlin: radical partisanship
[2:23:23] Sandrian: The two party system is a weird concept anyway cause you're forced to pick a side even if you may not agree with most of it.
[2:24:02] DonRaynor: @Sandrian that is by design to keep the two parties in power
[2:24:14] DonRaynor: SMOULDER
[2:24:15] SCRAAATCH: And you're guilted into NOT voting for any third option, even if you agree with them way more. It's awful.
[2:24:18] WeakestYugopnikEnjoyer: It's a choice between 99% H*tler and 100% H*tler, so go figure
[2:24:21] NotDyem: ratlord is online, why do you think he is not streaming?
[2:24:31] Erdagguey: problem in USA atm is you have to vote from pest to cholera... One cant count to 5 anymore and the other is a criminal narcicist...
[2:24:40] hitsujikoujou: In Australia we get multiple votes to list our preferences
[2:24:55] StabbySausage: twi'er
[2:24:56] Pamoth: @NotDyem He just gets flamed and triggered by chat when he plays top xdd
[2:24:57] ElusiveFRZ: @hitsujikoujou ranked choice ftw
[2:24:57] wuddlin: xdd classic
[2:25:04] WeakestYugopnikEnjoyer: @WeakestYugopnikEnjoyer Age doesn't matter, it's all about optics. Trump can yap for hours while Biden struggles to get a sentence out in 1 min
[2:25:08] natashaxmorgana: Medic what's a quick TL;DR on your opinion of UK political parties
[2:25:14] Airfire: imagine the power league of legends players would have if they read
[2:25:22] Sandrian: Electoral college should be reworked in the states. It was instituted in the late 1700's when it was all still actually separate states. Nowadays it's a system where your vote has more or less power depending on where you live and that's just not on.
[2:25:28] StabbySausage: > had a dream last night Keria was talking to me in English about how unplayable a draft was, and he was wearing a FNC jersey
[2:25:32] StabbySausage: there's your reason chat
[2:25:38] tayleport: isnt spunk slang for sperm ?
[2:25:40] DonRaynor: @hitsujikoujou yet you still have one of the most conservative and hard right leaning governments in "west"
[2:26:01] crispytain: @hitsujikoujou ???
[2:26:09] Jazzgar: all our political systems are fucked NotLikeThis
[2:26:10] StabbySausage: @MedicCasts did you put that song in the playlist or is that just perfect random hilarity
[2:26:18] Pamoth: You wouldnt ever move back to the UK? :O
[2:26:19] Roansas: @StabbySausage Think you need glasses since I think you saw Caedrel KEKW
[2:26:19] TheSharmony: I think I'm voting labour for the first time ever next election, if not an independent. Conservatives have drifted so far from the centre they one held a decade ago.
[2:26:30] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[2:26:53] TheSharmony: Amen
[2:26:56] TLS_Fish1: yeah but if you were here you could have gone to the co-op yesterday morning despite it being Sunday @MedicCasts
[2:26:56] hitsujikoujou: @DonRaynor If people dont use their rights, what can you do?
[2:26:57] KrollV: KrollV subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 3 years of banger streams and questionably intriguing titles, thank you for everything! <3
[2:27:00] StabbySausage: @Roansas that was a quote from caedrels tiwtter
[2:27:00] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord
[2:27:02] NotDyem: who are you rooting for fnc vs sk?
[2:27:08] jammy_pineapple: Brexit became a bit of a purity test for the Cons and they purged all of the moderate elements of their party
[2:27:09] c_17: conservatives have ripped the country apart
[2:27:16] T_Dog97: That Rwanda stuff is genuinely insane
[2:27:26] Sandrian: Maybe just let Caedrel do what he wants lol
[2:27:30] TheSharmony: It's also deeply disgusting how Rishi's prancing around like his policys were given a mandate by the people
[2:27:43] Barushko: conservatives have always been really far right compared to most EU countries historically no?
[2:27:46] DonRaynor: @hitsujikoujou aboslutely nothing, I believe personally problem is in education (as we have in Finland) but I offer no solution.
[2:27:59] Oneminuterice: smolder W so good at getting push or enemy duo just didnt hit wave?
[2:28:00] NotDyem: @pamoth caedrel def getting that theshy treatment from fans
[2:28:01] natashaxmorgana: I think Labour is currently a poor man's tories. Referring back to our earlier discussions about gender identity and such, labour backed a bill to pool resources into retraining, re-publicising NHS resources to remove inclusive language from all of their publications and penalising staff for doing so. As well as forcing trans people to be on wards of the at-birth gender
[2:28:14] Necrosity: Weren't BDS supposed to play yesterday?
[2:28:19] MaraudingBacon: can some one help a twitter noob. i dont use the app but i dont see any recent caedral tweets to see why he might not be streaming.
[2:28:29] hitsujikoujou: Leopards ate my face is one of my favourite subs for a reason.
[2:28:33] ZuvaStyle: I've been a full BDS fan since worlds, but ngl, I got a bit sad by the performance yesterday PepeHands
[2:28:39] TLS_Fish1: bigggg
[2:28:45] jammy_pineapple: Brexit is I think the only instance of a country imposing trade sanctions on itself lol
[2:28:45] jucchanUwU: whats the gameplan for playing an engage sup with a scaling pick like smolder?
[2:28:47] TheSharmony: When Brexit was announced I was working in an office, and the only two people who were gleeful over the announcement were the two most unhinged people there.
[2:28:52] Shadewfire: There are billboards now win the US that list UK and Europe separately
[2:28:55] Pamoth: @Necrosity They werre supposed to but didnt show up xdd
[2:29:04] TLS_Fish1: G2 are the masters of regular split sandbagging
[2:29:10] Airfire: @MaraudingBacon you are looking for a twitter called caedrelupdates which he uses to tell his community about stream stuff rather than spamming his main twitter
[2:29:12] MaraudingBacon: @NotDyem sup. can you guys please help me find the tweet or message. im apparently a twitter noob and am out of the loo[
[2:29:16] Roansas: I mean. BDS played like they always did
[2:29:37] Squallly: oooh, tomorrow is pancake day - anyone partaking?
[2:29:42] Roansas: G2 is just way above any European team which means EU will never improve LUL
[2:29:43] NotDyem: @maraudingbacon it’s @caedrelupdates
[2:29:44] MaraudingBacon: @MaraudingBacon i tried this and the first message that pops uip for me is him getting a seat in the finals for worlds wearing a suit hence why im feeling stupid
[2:29:45] Sandrian: ohai Squally
[2:29:58] Squallly: @Sandrian heya!
[2:30:00] Pamoth: SIck of his shit xdd
[2:30:05] ZuvaStyle: @Squallly didn't know it until you just said so, but now I absolutely am
[2:30:05] crispytain: brexit was kinda morbily hilarious to watch as an outsider its like top running it down because they went 0/0/0 while jg camped bot and got them 10 kills up
[2:30:10] shockzjEe: Morning @MedicCasts hope you're having a great day my man
[2:30:16] itsmaffs: @Squallly yes, all three meals, every year. try and stop me

[2:32:15] alyushacb: HE DOING IT TO THEM
[2:32:34] crispytain: @Oneminuterice press q and a and then laugh at his face
[2:32:39] TLS_Fish1: Smoulder isn't good enough late game to be worth that early game. I'd still take a Jinx/Twitch/Ez later on
[2:33:06] DonRaynor: Smoulder beats all three of those late
[2:33:08] jimmix12: when you are you gonna cast in the lec @MedicCasts ?
[2:33:09] Oneminuterice: @Oneminuterice as leona sure as anyone else on our comp is a bit tragic
[2:33:17] FunkyBarmen: smolder is much better early than jinx tho
[2:33:17] DonRaynor: the perma elder + outranges all of them
[2:33:19] LUCYXZ1337: another leona abuse game
[2:33:26] ZuvaStyle: I had a smolder game that went to 400 stacks, it was absolutely disgusting
