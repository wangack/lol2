[1:03:52] Ashimaar: it's hard to estimate damage outputs in lol
[1:03:53] QtDivinity: Not to say one is harder than the other it's just mechanics for fighting are more rewarded in league imo compared to dota being other mechanics
[1:04:01] omun1601: if u're a dota player going to league, no turn rate is fun. if u are a league guy going to dota, turn rate is Despairge
[1:04:25] QtDivinity: @Ashimaar that's strictly experience
[1:04:46] QtDivinity: play the game more you can estimate your dmg dealt and taken windows much better
[1:04:49] Ashimaar: @omun1601 wdym? turn rate IS a mechanic and you get rewarded fr abusing it. EG: puck shift + blink, storm can zap behind enemies to abuse that they have to turn to react
[1:05:11] utkuso1: take red
[1:05:19] QtDivinity: @omun1601 sure he's not saying it isnt a mechanic it just feels like dogshit LOL
[1:05:24] x_Scy: @omun1601 it still feels like shit if you go from no turn rate to turn rate, which is what the commenter clearly was getting at
[1:05:26] Ashimaar: @QtDivinity lmao sure

[1:07:35] x_Scy: Ashimaar the alternative is always buy the same shit, why have items exist at all at that point
[1:07:59] afroamericanpotato: with your couple hundred hours of gameplay ofcourse you are not gonna know what item to build in what situation or what kills you or not @Ashimaar you are just assuming there isnt because you didnt play the game enough
[1:08:04] benq1338: uuh
[1:08:06] QtDivinity: @Ashimaar there are situational builds depending on the game and what role you're in adc probably has the worst of that but other roles are far better
[1:08:23] SHHamps: @ashimaar I think that was imprecise... maybe 60% champs have first or second items 'locked' but theres always room for situational things
