[4:19:48] LetTheScoutCook: welcome to 1% club
[4:20:15] Amazing68: welcome to league of legends basics
[4:20:16] LetTheScoutCook: jg never ganks teemo top.. even tho its most snowballing lane
[4:20:18] Amazing68: :D
[4:20:35] 514484: KEKW
[4:20:38] Amazing68: GRUBS KEKW
[4:20:50] LetTheScoutCook: Grubs extremely overrated
[4:20:51] Layxo: Primitive Jax LUL
[4:20:59] Amazing68: non toxic taimo main Kappa
[4:21:14] LetTheScoutCook: I think Jax is orang utan
[4:21:22] Abdullah473: grabs are good if you have prio for toplane/strongside
[4:21:27] Abdullah473: if not just do dragon
[4:21:50] Abdullah473: and if all lanes are weakside, just gank kek
[4:22:12] Layxo: Jhin ?
[4:22:39] Abdullah473: was that hwei blast?
[4:22:44] Abdullah473: damn 4 man gank top
[4:22:46] Aldurfus: yes
[4:22:47] Layxo: Senna my bad
[4:22:57] LetTheScoutCook: well.. its not ur fault this laning phase.. jax should rly just recognize u are in bad matchup and help you rly..
[4:23:10] LetTheScoutCook: jg is supporting role
[4:23:16] LetTheScoutCook: should fking help lanes
[4:23:25] Aldurfus: no lane has touched a turret KEKW
[4:23:52] 514484: and even if you do aplly it , ti's small
[4:23:56] LetTheScoutCook: when i play teemo jg ,, i gank top a lot since it is snowbally lane af
[4:24:13] LetTheScoutCook: one gank can change top lane hard
[4:24:13] 514484: msot snowbally lane is obviously bot
[4:24:20] LetTheScoutCook: nah
[4:24:23] LetTheScoutCook: there is a lot going on
[4:24:23] 514484: yes
[4:24:27] LetTheScoutCook: u can get shutdowns easily
[4:24:27] 514484: twice the gold
[4:24:30] LetTheScoutCook: but top
[4:24:31] 514484: one dies, the other msot likely dies
[4:24:31] LetTheScoutCook: not rly
[4:24:42] LetTheScoutCook: ahead opponent can run u down over and over
[4:24:43] 514484: yes really
[4:24:52] 514484: and bot can't do that?
[4:24:55] seigebrisbane: see jax is 5head
[4:24:55] LetTheScoutCook: no
[4:25:02] 514484: not only bot does that but with twice the gold
[4:25:03] LetTheScoutCook: there are two ppl and to many variables
[4:25:07] LetTheScoutCook: i mean 4
[4:25:12] LetTheScoutCook: they do mistakes
[4:25:18] LetTheScoutCook: that cost them lead
[4:25:20] 514484: and top can't make mistakes?
[4:25:27] LetTheScoutCook: its much less likely
[4:25:34] Aldurfus: jax modCheck
[4:25:38] 514484: lol
[4:25:55] LetTheScoutCook: in 1v1 lane is just over for the one behind
[4:26:01] Abdullah473: top is way more snowbally than bot
[4:26:27] 514484: hard disagree
[4:26:35] purifish: @514484 youre wrong tho
[4:26:43] Layxo: ah sh here we go again
[4:26:45] LetTheScoutCook: u lend good hook on bot and u win even vs fed opponents
[4:26:45] 514484: no, you are.
[4:26:50] seigebrisbane: top is easier to slow down to stagnant
[4:26:52] seigebrisbane: bot is firecracker
[4:26:55] purifish: in melee vs melee match its over once one snowballs
[4:27:05] purifish: you dont have that in bot
[4:27:32] purifish: like imagine playing vs fed irelia
[4:27:35] 514484: every game a bot dies 20 times, but "top is the most snowbally" KEKW
[4:27:35] Abdullah473: yeah, lets say you are a sion and an irelia is freezing the wave against you
[4:27:37] Abdullah473: its gg
[4:27:38] purifish: you cant even walk up
[4:28:04] LetTheScoutCook: well.. if u bot is 0/20 then they are getting smurfed on
[4:28:05] Abdullah473: @purifish lol we had the same exact analogy
[4:28:11] purifish: yeah :P
[4:28:11] Aldurfus: three items already WOT
[4:28:34] Layxo: LMAO
[4:28:43] purifish: @514484 thats more of skill issue
[4:28:49] purifish: bot dont need to die that many timrs
[4:29:01] seigebrisbane: fee ess tah
[4:29:21] Aldurfus: filled jungle Smoge
[4:29:28] Aldurfus: just insta lose
[4:29:44] Abdullah473: In all my years of playing botlane, I never down or ahead more than like 50 cs. Adc have an easy time csing under turret and from range
[4:29:46] 514484: ðŸ¤¡
[4:30:05] purifish: @Abdullah473 except when camped KEKW
[4:30:06] Abdullah473: But I got like flame horizoned BADLY multiple times on toplane
[4:30:37] Abdullah473: @purifish ye
[4:30:45] Layxo: Cassy getting greedy
[4:30:55] LetTheScoutCook: idk why jg ignores teemo players.. teemo is extremely snowbally.. like its fking insane
[4:31:16] LetTheScoutCook: he can shroom enemy jg and push inhibs  like nothing
[4:31:37] 291x: LoJ POGGERS new game Kappa
[4:31:38] Aldurfus: jg not even playing KEKW
[4:31:49] Abdullah473: my worst experience was me playing top sion vs fiora. I was 0/9 with 70 cs at 20min
[4:31:51] LetTheScoutCook: i fking hate junglers ..
[4:32:05] LetTheScoutCook: they never gank teemo lane
[4:32:10] LetTheScoutCook: atleast not in d3
[4:32:23] 514484: teemo is useless
[4:32:28] 514484: i wouldn't gank teemo either
[4:32:29] LetTheScoutCook: here we go
[4:32:46] LetTheScoutCook: well teemo is useless thats why ppl getting into chall with him
[4:32:46] 291x: teemo is cute AYAYA
[4:32:47] LetTheScoutCook: ye
[4:33:10] 514484: oh, how many people are doing that comapred to other champs :)
[4:33:11] LetTheScoutCook: teemo can literally take over the game if ahead, so much control
[4:33:26] 514484: LUL
[4:33:32] LetTheScoutCook: its 4th best late game champ.. if u get him into his items sooner.. its over
[4:33:38] purifish: nah teemo scales well but doesnt snowball well
[4:33:44] 514484: please NotLikeThis

[4:37:51] Abdullah473: but ggs
[4:38:20] 514484: can't believe you lost, teemo is the strongest champ in the game by far :)
[4:38:28] 514484: FeelsBadMan
[4:38:32] Lazynameross: mm?
[4:38:39] Lazynameross: you cant get autod twice in row
[4:38:42] purifish: honestly just play jhin jungle lol
[4:39:04] purifish: @Lazynameross secondary role deosnt count as fill
[4:39:23] ImNecessaryEvil: Cassi is the hardest counter to Teemo.
[4:39:24] Lazynameross: oh thought earlier someone said he was autofilled
[4:39:55] purifish: i mean he mains adc but you have to put 2 roles to ranked
[4:40:29] Lazynameross: id call it offroled so misunderstood autofilled
[4:40:35] purifish: maybe cos they thought jg is popular role
[4:40:43] purifish: so less likely to be filled
