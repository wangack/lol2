[0:36:33] watson1235: santorinWave
[0:36:46] jousef9: i love supportive junglers but i always end up losing cuz my team suicided
[0:36:51] hippy_fry: in NA i wait 4-8 minutes for a gold elo game and then I watch Santorins stream he has similar times for challenger omegalul
[0:37:10] pityalol: why do you buy bow instead of a long sword? It gives so little stats @Santorin
[0:37:11] ItsNefar: When I see you play belveth feels broken when I play it feels shit ass
[0:37:19] watson1235: I’m good how are you doing?
[0:37:25] Wildcobra_: @hippy_fry wtffff
[0:37:33] getsometalentloser: tank junglers are kinda predictable in what they will do
[0:37:36] shadow7master: peepoHey how its going
[0:37:46] Wildcobra_: my emerald diamond queus arent that long
[0:38:09] Nyanra: GIGACHAD
[0:38:10] jousef9: I went from bronze to gold after 9 days of switching fron nidalee to viego
[0:38:25] rang0xzlol: @jousef9 ye nidalee is not a champion
[0:38:40] getsometalentloser: nidalee is super strong rn
[0:38:41] Caendred: @jousef9 playing Nid as a bronze player is just begging to loose
[0:38:45] getsometalentloser: but u have to bee good at the game
[0:38:54] oreomegalul: true form off grubs?
[0:39:02] Caendred: It's like playing azir in bronze
[0:39:12] jousef9: @rang0xzlol unfortunately she is my favorite champ of all time

[0:45:49] GhostxxHorse: feed the ksante
[0:45:52] nyxos101: When you play Bel'veth how do you take on team fights, or is it better to just be split pushing?
[0:46:32] moosE3knucklE: casual 1.3k gold for akali in like 30 seconds
[0:48:04] stofmeister44: doesn't seem to be as easy as few minutes ago xD
[0:51:27] Mirabelle_478: @nyxos101 play like an assasin/viego, look for a pick, get ult and use e smart
[0:51:27] holy_pineapples: holy_pineapples subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[0:51:40] watson1235: you talked him up too much now he throwing 🤣
[0:52:42] Wildcobra_: flame him, tell him to go back to academy KEKW
[0:53:17] jousef9: jousef9 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:53:43] Nyanra: Juicef
[0:53:51] jousef9: u said it right
[0:54:05] austang31: When you got pro coaching, what did you learn that opened your eyes the most in League?
[0:54:38] jousef9: yosif
[0:57:43] Euheimr: would you say macro mattered less in the earlier days of league
[0:58:34] eMbbuZomg: death’s dance xd
[0:59:07] Euheimr: makes sense
[1:00:33] sebastianminiatures: @eMbbuZomg salutations exile
[1:00:42] getsometalentloser: when pros expose the lack of macro solo queue players have ?
[1:01:10] Wildcobra_: did tou play with hautzer back in 2015? i dont remember
[1:01:57] eMbbuZomg: @minimancer27 🙋
[1:02:06] holy_pineapples: The enemy team started talking about the power of friendship in their chat, thats why they started to take off
[1:02:15] Wildcobra_: i think hes still my all time fav top laner, him and BB
[1:02:24] Jamanna: did you ever play with bjerg?
[1:03:10] jousef9: they used to film you guys in that sad van after every loss with tsm lol
[1:03:15] jousef9: old days
[1:03:16] pityalol: you can play gwen jg
[1:03:25] moosE3knucklE: i must say. Quid has been a big surprise this split. im not gonna lie i was wondering why 100T brought him back but that kid has become a whole different player
[1:03:59] jzipfel20: How have you liked Palworld?
[1:04:10] moosE3knucklE: oof
[1:04:20] Nyanra: show where it went downhill
[1:04:25] motorboater2: Sooo.. what did we learn? If you have fun, you lose. Aim to have a shit time
[1:04:27] pityalol: she has realy decent wr in jungle
[1:05:18] Nyanra: ah
[1:05:49] moosE3knucklE: vetheo got 1.3k gold in shutdowns there from u and varus. in like 15 seconds
[1:06:58] TimeWizardLuL: how ls lillia jung after nerfs?
[1:07:29] moosE3knucklE: lathyrus doesnt seem to be having a good time either lol
[1:07:59] ChicoLoLxD: @Santorin Why are we seeing tank junglers in pro play when they're so weak in solo q
[1:08:15] Nyanra: xddTeletubbies
[1:08:54] hippy_fry: jungle seems to be the new support
[1:09:10] getsometalentloser: it’s sad jungle got nerfed cause of its influence on map yet support can do the same thing with no consequence and getting buffed
[1:09:10] moosE3knucklE: the tank junglers also seem to have the best kits to set up team fights. like Sej and Rell and Maokai
[1:09:28] rybko17: do you remember meta when braum cleare jungle with jungler as duo?
[1:09:32] holy_pineapples: The objective of the Jungle this season is to have their lanes get fed / even.
[1:11:06] nwa4lifeTV: xz?
[1:11:13] jousef9: ngl its lee angle
[1:11:15] ItsNefar: WHy you always ban annie?
[1:11:19] Nyanra: Will you ever play Qiyana mister Lucas
[1:11:20] Gizan: worst meta in pro play was 2v1top and 2v1 bot, just rushing towers
[1:11:40] ItsNefar: Make sense lol
[1:11:52] shadow7master: nothing match the river shen good old days
[1:12:03] Dopaminw: GG, was the rell, i had good players with me ahaha
[1:12:21] getsometalentloser: with the way riot keep making jungle
[1:12:26] Nyanra: River shen? Farm?
[1:12:31] Nyanra: PepeLaugh
[1:12:36] getsometalentloser: ppl will realise the crying there doing is going to end up
[1:12:45] shadow7master: no farm thats why river KEKW
[1:12:48] getsometalentloser: with perma spam gank meta cause there’s nothing better to do
[1:12:51] Caendred: They buffed shen jungles clear a few patches ago when they buffed Darius and zed jungle, he's alright now
[1:12:54] nyxos101: Are there any good tank junglers that do work in solo queue?
[1:13:03] getsometalentloser: @nyxos101  Zac probably
[1:13:10] getsometalentloser: maybe udyr
[1:13:31] mr_lockpicking: i do miss that one season where you could play predator shen jungle, riot needs to bring back predator that rune was so fun
[1:13:44] moosE3knucklE: i think its time for a Shen rework. as a shen main myself. the champ feels giga useless in this meta
[1:14:11] shadow7master: is amumu still good?
[1:14:23] Caendred: @mr_lockpicking they made a dev blog explaining that they're keeping the rune bad on purpose cause its design make it so that if it's buffed it's almost automatically broken
[1:14:24] eMbbuZomg: zac works cuz its not balanced
[1:14:24] jzipfel20: maokai
[1:14:32] jousef9: Zac is the best tank jungler rn
[1:14:50] getsometalentloser: zac stats wise is better in lane rn
[1:15:00] getsometalentloser: with try jungle being his weakest role rn
[1:15:04] Caendred: @moose3knuckle I think if they just added some HP scaling to his Q the champ would be amazing, kit is still super fun otherwise
[1:15:08] getsometalentloser: still has the same weaknesses
[1:15:23] DesperateNasus: for that,,,
[1:15:29] shadow7master: ramus is good in some matches too
[1:15:31] DesperateNasus: what did she do>
[1:15:44] Caendred: @moose3knuckle like it makes no sense to me that he has a 15% HP scaling on his taunt but not something like a 7% HP scaling on his Q
[1:16:22] moosE3knucklE: @Caendred yeah. that could help. the kit is great. but i spend the entire game shoved under turret lol and people just die so fast now that even my ult feels useless. and if someone builds serpants fang it counters ur ult shield lol
[1:16:24] ellstone: Hey everyone have a great game mate @Santorin
[1:17:02] Gameboy736: doesn't blitz have a plat chroma
[1:17:50] Caendred: @moose3knuckle yeah being so item reliant to have clearing capabilities on shen is dreadful, same as ww like these champs really need some form of innate aoe in their kits to keep up with new league
[1:19:17] moosE3knucklE: @Caendred true. but because of Ksante. its like why bother going any other tank top. especially shen. Shen doesnt really do damage. ur so team reliant that u either look amazing.. or look useless lol
[1:19:20] DesperateNasus: gg
[1:19:41] nwa4lifeTV: ngl tf top pretty strong
[1:20:40] nwa4lifeTV: "lets bounce"
[1:21:14] DaveSnow: Hows the pain today? Any better?
[1:22:32] solelyflerken: Whats painfull? The league games?
[1:23:07] Nyanra: OOOO
[1:23:10] solelyflerken: clean
[1:23:31] eMbbuZomg: the wisdom tooth removal
[1:24:02] nwa4lifeTV: u ever max e on ls like oner?
[1:24:28] nwa4lifeTV: brofresco monkaW
[1:24:35] Alveneb: tf is so op rn
[1:25:35] Alveneb: btw is kill through fog intended? I swear I thoght it was a bug since s3 KEKW
[1:25:50] getsometalentloser: ngl ghost should have reduced duration on ranged champs
[1:26:16] Gizan: WTF
[1:26:16] Alveneb: RIOT
[1:26:16] solelyflerken: that looked like enemy galio r
[1:26:17] Nyanra: WHAT
[1:26:21] solelyflerken: nice heals shields
[1:26:30] Alveneb: nida heal buff EZ
[1:26:36] Alveneb: +milio
[1:26:37] eMbbuZomg: new nidalee heal
[1:26:39] basik: milio smurfed the fuck out of that too tho
[1:26:41] Gizan: i thought the r q would execute him
[1:26:44] getsometalentloser: probably nidalee heal
[1:26:52] moosE3knucklE: nidalee and milio kept him alive
[1:27:43] nwa4lifeTV: hwei also shields
[1:30:44] Gizan: remember when champs used to be with 1 ability per button KEKW
[1:31:11] Dodgerx: @Gizan come on nidalee has been in the game for age
[1:31:29] jousef9: remember when it was ok if some abilities are just like a passive
[1:31:44] HunterericTV: after the ksante balancing ive lost faith LUL
[1:32:22] moosE3knucklE: ksante will never be balanced. that kit cant be balanced lol. it just needs be deleted and redone haha
[1:32:38] getsometalentloser: tf is so disgusting broken
[1:33:16] eMbbuZomg: zac has r
[1:33:18] eMbbuZomg: not pressing
[1:33:19] eMbbuZomg: xdd
[1:34:35] Dodgerx: isn't dd bad?
[1:35:27] eMbbuZomg: death's dance rush on bel feels good
[1:35:48] colc23: Is this really high ELO?
[1:35:52] Gizan: i dont think zac is having a good time
[1:36:46] nwa4lifeTV: sus
[1:36:50] moosE3knucklE: milio had more gold that zac
[1:36:58] solidussovis: I am still impressed that you climb into top 10 with no map cover or delay. More impressive then other streamers "climbing"
[1:37:27] Offsette7: any tips on mid/late game?
[1:37:44] basik: not much point of a map cover on a jungler, the main point of stream sniping is to find the jungler
[1:37:54] Wildcobra_: wait, really?!
[1:37:59] Offsette7: junglerino
[1:38:04] Wildcobra_: why dos riot hate people
[1:38:30] pityalol: Sholdnt it make no difference in the long run? Since lp gains are reflected by mmr either way?
[1:38:43] Baker076: im impressed he can laugh off this rigged matchmaking. id be mad the rest of the day aha
[1:39:03] moosE3knucklE: when you cover the map what are u covering? "the jungle" if u are the jungle what is the point of a map cover. if ppl can just see where u are on the screen lol @solidussovis
[1:40:29] solidussovis: @moosE3knucklE Yes so laners cover map and junglers usually delay the stream for 30 seconds or more. He just plays so its impressive compared to other streamers. Laners and junglers alike
[1:41:21] eMbbuZomg: and they can just go get random objectives
[1:41:35] holytoby: @Santorin Did you watch the Jankos "Surrender Culture" clip? They lose a team fight and just all mass surrender and Janos loses his mind. Rightfully so.
[1:41:42] moosE3knucklE: yeah i mean fair. but i feel like most ppl just ghost to see where the jungler is. i dont often feel like people that do that are that smart lol
[1:42:39] getsometalentloser: ego ff
[1:42:41] holytoby: Yeah; I was going to explain that part but it got long lol
[1:42:47] alabamahammer02: ff is the only way
[1:42:50] getsometalentloser: when they can’t be the main character they would rather lost then get carried
[1:42:53] getsometalentloser: society is doomed
[1:43:39] getsometalentloser: one thing I’ve noticed a lot of ppl have no idea how to play if there themselves are not ahewd
[1:43:42] getsometalentloser: even if they go even
[1:43:50] getsometalentloser: they don’t know how to@play the game
[1:44:15] jzipfel20: Galio!
[1:44:20] Baker076: yeah especially if the players on an assasin or engage tank but your team has a peel comp
[1:45:11] colc23: Qzir
[1:45:11] holytoby: annie
[1:45:12] getsometalentloser: galio
[1:45:15] eMbbuZomg: I played flex que for the 1st time ever, got placed to iron 2 i think, I've never had more fun in my games
[1:45:20] eMbbuZomg: every game is a 45min+ fiesta
[1:45:35] getsometalentloser: THIS WAS A FREE GALIO GAME
[1:46:22] Dodgerx: @eMbbuZomg so true... whenever I play with friends now we Q flex the games are so much more blaanced & people take it way less seriously that normal drafts
[1:46:27] Dacker___: How else will you learn Galio!?
[1:46:27] Social_Phobia: @eMbbuZomg its still like that in plat/emerald xDD - or they ff when their team is 0/5 at 15
[1:46:42] holy_pineapples: Where can I find the Playlist? It is Absolute Fire
[1:46:44] holytoby: Cheer100 My biggest issue with this season as a top laner. Im never really playing to be the "main character" used to being on an island. Leave laning phase at 0/0 or 2/2... meanwhile the rest of the map is 25/27 and its like... Why is this season call of duty

[1:48:16] moosE3knucklE: thats been the top lane expierence for awhile. u go 0/0/0 lane phase just trading back and forth and farming against ur oppenent while the rest of the map is on fire
[1:48:18] eMbbuZomg: u can auto them lvl 1 and win
[1:48:19] solidussovis: I always laugh that every role has a complaint about the game even if its their role that is strongest.

[2:10:11] supercole2001: hey Lucas how’s the grind going
[2:10:13] Alveneb: he's an OTP, he would never think about the game other than his first 3 minions XP Clueless
[2:10:16] Social_Phobia: why do i never have a laner that does that but enemies do? X
[2:10:40] Euheimr: surely Clueless
[2:10:51] moosE3knucklE: yeah this looks omega doomed
[2:10:56] Baker076: i lost a perfect placement to something similar. laners afk in the fist minute 30
[2:11:50] mythicalord1: Im curious, how did you know Fiora was gonna do it?
[2:11:57] Social_Phobia: @Baker076 it feels like you just get teammates like this every now and then, or support inviding alone and just dying XD
[2:12:11] xNoboat: hello Mr santorin
[2:12:38] Wildcobra_: tell him to ligma

[2:14:41] mythicalord1: @Santorin Im curious, how did you know Fiora was gonna run at your blue?
[2:14:57] Social_Phobia: @Baker076 tbh if its just the first invade its still winable, but if that continues and your team just afks at enemy turret instead of helping.. and then cry bcs the enemy jungle ganks :P
[2:15:40] moosE3knucklE: udyr will do the same thing and darius.
[2:16:03] Tdorkx: New player here (also new to pc in general) - Any tips for a noob struggling with the switch from console lol? Keen to stick with it.
[2:16:22] Baker076: @Social_Phobia ur right its still salvageable. my mid died lvl 2 tho immediately after enemy jng takes my red and we obv see them there. and my tempo fcked rest of game
[2:16:40] Gizan: 17 cs Kayle KEKW
[2:17:01] Social_Phobia: @Baker076 in games like this you can just hope that the enemy makes mistakes that you are able to punish, in plat/emerald its often possible
[2:17:04] moosE3knucklE: kayle has 17 cs still...
[2:17:05] supercole2001: did we get a full review on the glass mousepad yet?
[2:17:08] Alveneb: lvl 4 x lvl 7 tho
[2:18:01] motorboater2: Whatre your thoughts on this zac champ in the top lane
[2:18:10] Baker076: @Social_Phobia it was diamond mmr so still possible

[2:41:44] moosE3knucklE: that C9 vs 100T game last night was pretty damn good.
[2:42:31] GhostxxHorse: @tugwos santorinLUL santorinLUL santorinLUL  he's usually pretty good, but he's started blowing raspberries, so that is his main priority right now
[2:42:40] hippy_fry: ^that c9 game had me tilted af

[3:04:20] Alveneb: dude just doesn't know the fkin game, plays for lane pressure cuz champs are disgusting
[3:04:43] binultwitch: u guys scale so hard this game
[3:04:53] moosE3knucklE: this guys has just hasnt punished the diana. he could either move with her or just shove lane in. but the diana has more farm than him and has made ur life miserable
