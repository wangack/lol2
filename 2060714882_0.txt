[1:21:16] Loki_The_Padawan: jumped right into it
[1:21:17] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea nasus withered you I think then you got stunned
[1:21:30] crisfer2019: Hello beautiful greetings from Colombia
[1:21:36] yepein99: Twitch is ap
[1:21:47] quark978: ap twitch says, true dmg is better
[1:21:52] inSINwetrust: But why is he ap, thou
[1:21:55] SquirrelMaster61985: AP does true damage actually might be the right counter to nasus lol
[1:21:56] inSINwetrust: nezWeasel
[1:22:24] FrostySupreem: Nasus is building straight MR they already have AP on the team
[1:22:25] inSINwetrust: You know what also deals with Nasus? AD twitch nezWeasel
[1:22:29] Siempje010: if you can servive a teamfight its gg youl destroy there base so easy
[1:22:31] quark978: with the new shadowflame item, AP twitch is legit OP once they drop below 35% health
[1:22:45] lilCACTUSS9: Atom explosion resistant plant Kappa
[1:22:47] Aikha: Hola Kelsie, como estas? Have an awesome monday/week
[1:22:47] VanillaEssenceLoL: would it take 3 hits
[1:22:48] SquirrelMaster61985: Zyra plants take reduced aoe damage
[1:22:54] AzogDaAussie: they have big resistance to AoE
[1:22:59] VanillaEssenceLoL: not spells?
[1:23:30] Nadro: oh no no no
[1:23:31] Aikha: LOL cait
[1:23:35] Snowblood__: wow
[1:23:43] jesuslovesyou71: Glorious light of heaven above!
[1:24:15] S17Master: Raid boss down
[1:24:18] Gar116: Jesus, four of you on him
[1:24:21] BlackNovaQ42: top lane is always the problem
[1:24:34] VanillaEssenceLoL: 4v1 struggling is just showing how unbalanced some champions are
[1:24:39] quark978: on the brightside, at least susan has a simple set of abilities lmao
[1:25:26] VanillaEssenceLoL: that nasus is nasty
[1:25:31] inSINwetrust: nezWeasel nezWeasel
[1:25:40] VanillaEssenceLoL: that’s just not normal
[1:25:42] krunchypotatoo: Balanced
[1:25:42] bornofklay: league of tanks
[1:25:42] Squidymon: tanks 50 turret shots
[1:25:45] reginaphalange00: turrets: take this 2 dmg
[1:25:48] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea that’s a full tank nasus doing damage btw
[1:25:51] Gar116: And two towers hitting him lol
[1:25:59] tehbluehue: and he was tanking 2 turrets ....
[1:25:59] Veridyan888: a potato can win with Susan -_-
[1:26:02] FiveFM: 3 shots per tower... thought about leaving the tower range... decided he didn't need to.
[1:26:16] inSINwetrust: Not da feet rooF
[1:26:19] WeyIin: yep when 3v3 was a thing you either played tank or bruiser and won. Being mage and adc just didn't do anything
[1:26:21] krobylos: infinite scaling should not exist imo
[1:26:52] VanillaEssenceLoL: is there any way for streamers to get in contact with riot to complain about balancing and in general just complains about the game
[1:27:04] Siempje010: 2 be honest if twitch build AD you would have stand a better chance i think
[1:27:10] AzogDaAussie: "but then players would never build tank items, cos everyone wants to do damage" - Rito
[1:27:12] ajak636: how did he get that fed did the riven int?
[1:27:12] kellz30: Nas debuff with the tank scaling is just crazy
[1:27:33] lilCACTUSS9: If it was a one champion problem, then it would be easy, just ban him, but unfortunately 10 bans is not enough to get rid of all the champions who have these "qualities"
[1:27:34] inSINwetrust: Whenever I see a Nasus or Dr. Mundo on enemy team, I know the game will be a tilter
[1:27:44] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea twitch needed to build botrk and runaans…not whatever the hell that build was
[1:28:06] VanillaEssenceLoL: I see a report coming in the long amount of typing kaypTroll
[1:28:06] inSINwetrust: CHATTING
[1:28:17] kellz30: Riven into Nas wasn't it though
[1:28:26] guiltyprawn: Masters last season who FeelsDankMan
[1:28:38] ipstack: always teh same stuff with LoL
[1:28:41] Sir_Fish_Bucket: I gotta say, laning against an olaf as viktor is scary
[1:28:52] lilCACTUSS9: That is a good build but completely useless against tanks. Your team needed the on-hit dmg
[1:28:55] TrueKaru: this issue with League is the game is balanced very strictly around pro play.  if nasus was an issue there, he'd be nerfed
[1:29:04] Aikha: kaypFreya So cozy in the back <3
[1:29:37] kellz30: Yea Nas had 10 kills and no deaths late in game
[1:29:42] Niomah: Man your team. The dumb, it burrrrns
[1:29:44] VanillaEssenceLoL: I agree because a fed ADC can carry a whole game
[1:29:46] 3aaaa21: Much love from Egypt
[1:29:51] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea you should have done AD ziggs as a protest to your team 🤣
[1:30:00] Wostys: hey kp ım looking for that hoodie have u got link _
[1:30:09] BlackNovaQ42: didn't nasus have frozen heart? or was that a different match?
[1:30:22] kellz30: Yea frozen
[1:30:24] AzogDaAussie: and if he WAS planning to play APC in bot, he should have informed the team so that mid/jg can choose a compatible champ
[1:30:30] lilCACTUSS9: At this point Freya is just being disrespectful to people who have to work and earn a salary
[1:30:33] VanillaEssenceLoL: I got the adidas top that you have I hunted for it because I love it so much
[1:30:37] BlackNovaQ42: oh rip lol
[1:30:37] Aikha: Adidas sponsor pls
[1:30:39] guiltyprawn: Wym. It's a sabiba hoodie FeelsDankMan
[1:30:43] Balthazar94: Hey Kelsie, glad to be here. How's the day going, you doing alright?
[1:31:03] ericaborgest: Finally on lunch break kaypCheer
[1:31:16] Wostys: cant find on the site :(
[1:31:23] inSINwetrust: You told me 4 armot items out of 6, and he could still feal more damage than the whole team
[1:31:26] r00ran: nasus didnt needed the baron, he was the baron O.o
[1:31:27] lewhitehd69: damn someone put a beat on that and its like rapping pepeJAMJAM
[1:31:30] Smoothcollie: = mages suck, why do u even play them kaypShame
[1:31:31] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea LDR is soooo good against armor, then you have void staff not doing much against a nasus
[1:31:58] SquirrelMaster61985: im pretty sure im done with League. went from Plat 2 to silver 1 because of 2/25 bot lanes, First time teemo jungles, and full AP trundle tops. Literally at 35 LP loss vs 15 Lp gains.
[1:32:00] Darkcyter: @Balthazar94 @Aikha kaypHello kaypHello
[1:32:15] jimbob_ywert: hello KAYPEA
[1:32:19] Balthazar94: @Darkcyter Glad to see you kaypLove kaypComfy
[1:32:40] kellz30: His resistance to magic was already there he was 10 in 0
[1:32:41] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea riot will say “just get food and kill that nasus”
[1:32:42] VanillaEssenceLoL: it’s been tank meta for 5 years enough
[1:32:44] league_of_d3pression: good
[1:32:57] ajak636: what's crazy is that they nerfed rookern already Kappa
[1:33:09] BlackNovaQ42: that mr shield item is so stupid lmao idk why it's in the game
[1:33:11] kellz30: She had pen and still was tickling him
[1:33:24] ajak636: just delete rookern at this point
[1:33:30] ericaborgest: just play AD ahri mid Kappa
[1:33:37] champrath: rookern = you dont exist
[1:33:38] TheLiin: anivia is the way
[1:33:46] yepein99: Kaycn
[1:33:46] Niomah: Also some of the other resist and armor items DO DAMAGE in an aura
[1:33:48] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea if you can’t beat em, join em. time for tank nasus 🤣

[1:34:17] kellz30: Heartsteel everything
[1:34:17] inSINwetrust: Time to become the Nasus
[1:34:22] jhinios7: im going rookern on ahri every other game and no mage can ever get me
[1:34:36] chuckitdeep: Do you play Asol? I've heard he's pretty good this season
[1:34:41] Niomah: Veigar can outscale the MR by just getting an overwhelming number of stacks but still
[1:34:42] yepein99: I play league and sometimes i feel like my team is not good enough
[1:34:50] torge_154: hi KayPea
[1:34:58] champrath: @Niomah funny thing is veigar is inheritly bad against tanks
[1:35:00] ericaborgest: Zed Kappa

[2:05:48] Karimftw: I keep losing games, I don't understand but it has to be fully only my teammates' fault every game
[2:05:52] jareauu: my mmr even is above 50%

[2:10:33] Goriyay: ew wtf
[2:10:33] imyumss: did u try changin accs in those situtation ?
[2:10:44] norby75: friend of mine got to diamong with a 70% winrate, then she got a massive lose streak and now she gains 12LP for a win :D
[2:10:45] yoursadmuffin: Oh damn your MMR is fucked
[2:10:47] lewhitehd69: fuck losing 34 is rough, 3 losses = demote entire tier
[2:10:48] dalig_: there are so many brand new accounts everywhere ..
[2:10:53] yoursadmuffin: Same
[2:10:57] jimbob_ywert: the Kled loss streak :(
[2:10:57] Smoothcollie: @dalig_ Hey fam kaypHello How are u doin today kaypFlower
[2:11:15] HAYB3AR: I lost 35 the other day. after losing 26 then winning 26
[2:11:16] tallwastaken: I feel like they over punish loss streaks and then it's extremely difficult to recover
[2:11:16] lawfulevil_13: It's rough playing ranked and not caring about your rank
[2:11:19] jimbob_ywert: Old accounts are doomed
[2:11:20] dalig_: @Smoothcollie I'm very well! Thank you so much daligCRflower  How are u doing? <3
[2:11:24] Casyo99: Fun fact my friend got a new account ranked up to plat and got banned for some reason
[2:11:30] Karimftw: @jimbob_ywert hahah it was painful, made me question my life choices in being a one trick
[2:11:36] watson1235: it’s literally impossible to climb at those rates
[2:11:44] Casyo99: Yea think so
[2:11:49] Casyo99: was lv 30 without rank
[2:12:03] shane020829: I forgot Emerald is a new rank tier and I saw the title and think 'what?'
[2:12:03] markella_andri: i was plat  1 but at the end demoted gold 3  from unbalanced games sooo sad
[2:12:06] Hymuno: that happened to me in overwatch, was hardstuck silverr, made a new acc and got to high plat easily
[2:12:07] HAYB3AR: idk if its just me but I like lvling my own alt accounts. Something about it is refreshing lol
[2:12:10] psyhew: loss streaks will follow you even on new accounts
[2:12:16] yoursadmuffin: I went on a 8 loss streak and before that I was gaining like 37 lp and losing 20 but last time I lost I lost 27 lp so I stopped playing ranked on that account
[2:13:18] jimbob_ywert: @karimftw oh yeah Relatable kaypAwkward League really tests your patience. Massive respect for being a kled one trick though, can’t be mad when playing that champ kaypHappea
[2:13:23] HAYB3AR: I was about to start lvling an alt until the pass came out so thats on hold xD
[2:13:28] Karimftw: it's probably an inside job where they bank off the bot accounts
[2:13:39] Toraxini: @KayPea They are doing it in waves
[2:13:43] imyumss: i dont think they would ever do that, cause they would lose a lot of players  if they try to stop smurfing
[2:13:59] Goriyay: what r ur thoughts on bought accounts
[2:14:13] Karimftw: I didn't say that
[2:14:18] TheLiin: doesnt even matter cuz most places give oyu a new account if it gets banned
[2:14:22] megilino: @KayPea Hey, I was just wondering if it’s a possibility or request something I was just wondering if there is any way you can figure out or add to the stream close captioning so I can watch you at work  or I can’t have sound on  I know I’ve seen it on other stream. I’m just curious if that is an option thanks. :)
[2:14:39] iamtonin: i played a game yesterday where the enemy aatrox was so bad went like 2/16 but his rengar was challenger and boosting him. they then proceeded to link their twitch after the game and title was "challenger boosting my friend". absolutely shameless
[2:15:09] jimbob_ywert: boosters ruin the game.
[2:15:10] watson1235: conspiracy theory time: riot not taking more action because they are shadow selling accts only to ban them later to force people to buy more 🫣
[2:15:16] Casyo99: My friend also has an account since 2013 and is mmr is fked since like 2020 ...
[2:15:23] S17Master: @iamtonin The problem is it gets views and Riot sure as heck ain't gonna do anything about it
[2:15:27] Casyo99: He always loses more lp than wins
[2:15:53] Hymuno: it was my favorite thing seeing akshans spinning non stop hands off keyboard to level bot accs vs bots
[2:16:07] megilino: Thats  cool kp i was just wondering  someone came in to my office and was who is taking ... lol
[2:16:14] Skiddywags: i just wish they would just hard reset mmr every season
[2:16:16] Toraxini: @KayPea I think the matchmaking is the main problem bcs there is difference for example when you get fresh emerald player and master last season who is emerald now
[2:16:18] TheLiin: my main account is fine mmr wise
[2:16:25] HAYB3AR: My acc is from 2011......
[2:16:25] AzogDaAussie: @Casyo99 and this is why people create smurfs. If Riot fixed the MMR system, where people earned ELO properly, then there would be no need to make a smurf
[2:16:26] Casyo99: Mine isn't that bad and my account is old too
[2:16:27] tacobean1: Hi Kelso!! I hope you're having an amazing day!
[2:16:37] Casyo99: @Casyo99 Exacly
[2:16:49] jimbob_ywert: so is this your first ever account?
[2:16:50] Casyo99: I have 1 account since season 1 but is bronze mmr for some reason
[2:16:51] Casyo99: ...
[2:17:08] d0gma06: love this song
[2:17:24] dalig_: NF is so goooooood <3
[2:17:55] Casyo99: The only reason I don't create a new account is because of the skins I have on my main account ...
[2:18:00] HAYB3AR: I admit I found this song on Fortnite...
[2:18:10] megilino: i though thay are woking on that allredy
[2:18:55] watson1235: I think that the people worrying about it being tired to performance need to get good lol
[2:18:56] Casyo99: I have 212 isn't alot but are some still...
[2:19:14] jimbob_ywert: if only there was a way to transfer all your skins to another account, like a onetime thing
[2:19:18] yoursadmuffin: Yeah I've seen several ppl from different elos (from silver to grandmaster) struggling and going on huge loss streaks, this season is weird
[2:19:25] Toraxini: @KayPea I was 400Lp last season and i went on 13 lose streak this season in emerald it great league experience xd
[2:19:28] megilino: i do know tank players are mad if thay do bc tanks go like 0/10 /20 most games
[2:19:39] megilino: or what ever
[2:20:15] determined__exterminator: @insinwetrust why, because vex is op?
[2:20:21] ericaborgest: kaypVibe
[2:20:41] Toraxini: @KayPea Emerald is true elo hell tbh
[2:21:01] astra22002200: true
[2:21:07] Casyo99: Idk gold is insane bad
[2:21:25] Toraxini: @Casyo99 Gold you can solo carry
[2:21:33] watson1235: the people worried about it are people who only focus on kda
[2:21:40] Casyo99: @Casyo99 Well... I can't XD
[2:21:40] watson1235: which would get them in trouble
[2:22:20] KoboldQc: You're S+  to me though
[2:22:24] Toraxini: @KayPea But that doesnt really work in many cases bcs you can have 20 deaths and most dmg but that doesnt mean you did good that game
[2:22:25] KoboldQc: #smooth

[2:23:04] KoboldQc: Hey there Kay btw :D
[2:23:06] AzogDaAussie: @Toraxini if you've done most damage in the game, you must be doing something right, regardless of your KDA
[2:23:17] drsucio: Sucks when I enjoy to play full tank champs that require team synergy but can't do that in solo duo because everyone feeds and then I'm rendered useless unless I roam and help most of the time. League life is rough lol. Just stick to normies ranked is toxic imo
[2:23:17] Skiddywags: the grade system with some slight modifications could manage performance based mmr
[2:23:34] jimbob_ywert: Prediction?
[2:23:53] techoOoo: yeah the weekend has been good, just moved to my first apartment, how are you doing?

[2:23:57] Toraxini: @AzogDaAussie Not really bcs when you fight like demon every chance you get you get those dmg numbers but they are worthless we can see that on sion the best example

[2:25:24] Shepherd_of_Souls: @ferriswheel8 Hello hello.
[2:25:28] AzogDaAussie: @Toraxini but the final assessment of your performance will also include damage to structures, damage to epic monsters, vision score, etc. So yes, total damage will be an important factor, but not the only one. What KP is getting at is the fact that KDA is not the only factor being considered for your rating/ELO
[2:25:32] ericaborgest: huh
[2:25:32] Shepherd_of_Souls: @kirill___igorevich Hii!
[2:25:58] Shepherd_of_Souls: Been a long time since I watched KayPea. Nice to be back!
[2:26:21] Toraxini: @AzogDaAussie No thats not what i mean kda doesnt and shouldnt mesure your performance

[2:29:25] osvaldo96s: osvaldo96s subscribed with Prime.

[2:29:46] Jaguar542: People still rage quit being 5-0 if JG steals you cannon
[2:29:51] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea I’m sure riot can see from your ping etc and see if your internet is bad. you can’t fake that
[2:30:03] xBoomShotBaby: i witnessed recently a dingus getting flamed by a bigger dingus kaypLOL so he just stopped typing, so there definitely a chance they reform themselves.
[2:30:10] hurinthalion1337: Hi Kp and chat , how are you today ? HeyGuys HeyGuys

[2:31:02] lilCACTUSS9: @TheLiin Agree. When someone is toxic and flames others you can easily solve that by muting, but how do you fix a troll
[2:31:18] TheLiin: @lilCACTUSS9 exactly cant mute someone inting my game
[2:31:28] league_of_d3pression: @shepherd_of_souls damn, idk how you would detect if someone legitimately has bad internet or doing what you said. guess riot will never know.
[2:31:40] calicoastal: So maybe for DC it's like a 3 strikes thing, but if you're intentionally feeding or doing some other shit you only get one shot
[2:31:41] ericaborgest: like that lol

[2:41:27] jimbob_ywert: Next game is a win. I know it :)
[2:41:33] nicolasxduarte: Why is everyone losing a lot these days
[2:41:34] inSINwetrust: I get a lot of S grades with Viktor, and he is not in my champ pool. I do not even own him.
[2:41:36] Yuukily: @ferriswheel8  Hii eillaxWave
[2:41:40] Casyo99: When I ask my friends if they want to play I dont ask if they want to play I ask them if they want to get mad
[2:41:42] ani671: i feel riot is like "well you do so well in these games, let's give you better enemy teams and worst teammates to see if you can carry your way out of this." like...no riot james. kaypShame kaypPolice
[2:42:09] hurinthalion1337: what is best mid laner champ at the moment ?
[2:42:18] mrshibasan: HI KAY[EA IS ME SHIBAAAAA
[2:42:42] jimbob_ywert: How should riot fix the matchmaking?
[2:42:43] ani671: its just an endless, vicious cycle down the toilet.
[2:42:43] mrshibasan: HOW IS YOUUUUUUU?!?!?!
[2:42:51] nicolasxduarte: Did you watch Usher yesterday in the halftime show?
[2:42:55] Yuukily: I  was facing a racist midlaner last night and we were doing really bad but we came back and won. So fucking satisfying
[2:43:21] mrshibasan: Am I late??
[2:43:36] nicolasxduarte: lol me neither just the show
[2:43:41] Swenken: then why do the high elo players get 80% win rates ? i dont think losers Q exists, its a myth. Sometimes you get a bad team, but you can't be looking at it as a loss but rather as a practice how to stay focused on yourself, because at the end of the day its only your actions you can influence. If you wanna climb and try to improve, you will, im certain of it.
[2:43:43] FiveFM: Did Taylor win?
[2:43:49] dalig_: @FiveFM yep
[2:43:53] lawfulevil_13: Taylor won
[2:43:56] IoSonoBatman: And instead of losing less point (because you played so many ranked on that Elo) they keep making you losing so much LP like you dont deserve to play there even if you are the positive score on your team
[2:43:57] dalig_: daligHoly
[2:43:58] inSINwetrust: Wait, you did not watch Taylor Swift watch the superb owl? nezReally

[2:44:49] nicolasxduarte: Stooop you are scary kp
[2:45:00] Swenken: yes, because they are better than 99% of people. You are just as not better than what your rank says you are.
[2:45:01] AzogDaAussie: *drops mic*

[2:45:16] FiveFM: Oh we DEFINITELY need that tinfoil hat emote
[2:45:16] Yuukily: also its all the same people, the differences between high and low is that in high theres a lot of paid games and wind traders
[2:45:38] dalig_: Tayler1 struggles to get ouf Diamond for ages D:
[2:46:58] Lordofko: looks like murlock sound no ?
[2:47:04] bing_pot21: I love when u get angry
[2:47:09] Swenken: They get more than 80% win rates though. Many players are able to achieve that and get through lower ranks, not just challengers lol. You are just lazy to improve, mindlessly going through games without studying the game. If you wanna get better then you have to put in effort and not "just play the game".
[2:47:12] Yuukily: Its crazy how Ex masters/Gm's are stuck in emerald currently.

[2:49:27] BlackBeard_Ac3: I haven't even been playing the game that long and it's got to be matchmaking. I've only been playing for like 6 months and all of my ranked matches I've been in plat lobbies...not fair to them
[2:49:27] CipherAdminShady: how do you show ping and FPS in game again?
[2:49:32] lawfulevil_13: I live how you call people out. It's refreshing

[2:50:44] Yuukily: @Swenken  were not being rude but you bring your rank to seem like your opinion matters more is crazy
[2:50:53] dalig_: @heia_ko daligHello
[2:51:04] exorc157: types a 500 word essay then says they don’t care. calls you an emerald crybaby then says they aren’t trying to be rude. giving clown
[2:51:06] TheLiin: wait youre not supposed to get wall lvl 3
[2:51:08] eggramsey: swenken getting toasted

[2:52:22] inSINwetrust: rooFlag rooFlag
[2:52:31] AzogDaAussie: @Swenken you thinking you understand the situation more because of your rank shows that you're deluded. Why should the game be organised around the 0.2% of the player base? you're alienating the majority of your community.
[2:52:33] Smoothcollie: But WE like to bitch here, so if u not like it get outta here kaypJanitor
[2:52:35] watson1235: @swenken is that your lol GT? lmfao

[2:55:04] reallycreativ: Can someone explain why people started to play Camille support? Every time I have it on my team they just go in, int and die....
[2:55:06] heia_ko: @FathomlessFox yeaaaah
[2:55:17] lilCACTUSS9: That is a bold statemenet, my firend . Do you play the same champion pool? Do you play on stream, both focusing on the game and on chat?

And now it's time for you to claim that in this argument I'm giving you a "new perspective" which I recommend you to do your best to understand
[2:55:37] lumitails: I'm sure this person also rages and complains by blaming it on someone else
[2:55:37] watson1235: lol the highest elo “swenken” on OPGG has been was Diamond lmfao
[2:55:38] Yuukily: MMR ISSUES HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM  FYI, this season ruined it. OH AND BTW a 7x challenger did a video on this ( which is obviously higher than you btw ) and was saying the same thing. emerald was a coinflip every game for him.  Its literally a fucking nightmare elo

[2:57:51] Lhadge: But we are all challenger in our heart :D
[2:57:56] tequilamanhere: wtfk is going on tho kaypCreep
[2:57:57] Gossamer_DT: @Yuukily oh dear do you need another white doll?
[2:58:07] watson1235: naaawwww don’t come for Kp or you catch the smoke
[2:58:12] Yuukily: @Gossamer_DT Can you fucking elaborate LMAO
[2:58:18] watson1235: we fight at dawn!
[2:58:18] Bennodkk: i mean if you arent ttrying to climb and win but just fun take it to normal mode
[2:58:21] quark978: I'm gonna pretend that I'm challenger in ARAM
[2:58:29] Gossamer_DT: I don't get in battles with unarmed people sorry
[2:58:30] AmaraSol: AmaraSol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[2:58:32] lilCACTUSS9: @Smoothcollie Kappa
[2:58:34] AmaraSol: BIRB GAME
[2:58:36] FancyFastFox: I dont think anyone wants you to play sweaty every stream. Interaction and positivity would go down dramatically
[2:58:39] Yuukily: IM SO CONFUSED
[2:58:41] alluring_grace: I guess it would only matter if they are trying to become a pro-player, which most of us are not aiming for.
[2:58:49] jareauu: master cry baby
[2:58:52] ferriswheel8: Kels burning their flashes like that almost-masters-d4 guy kaypLOL
[2:59:07] IoSonoBatman: No need to be toxic like that Kappa

[2:59:29] Yuukily: AND BTW HE SAID " you guys were being rude " after we called out his bullshit
[2:59:34] AzogDaAussie: @Bennodkk to be fair, there's a difference between taking ranked seriously, not trolling AND enjoying the game, compared to playing League 24/7 with the sole purpose of climbing ranks
[2:59:41] Nevermolly: why u wanna be good when u re cute
[2:59:44] Smoothcollie: U could be even mby num.1 kaypTroll
[2:59:52] jareauu: who would study 24/7 the game? those ppl are crazy, get a life
[2:59:56] Smoothcollie: Fighting over it with Lucas
[2:59:59] jimbob_ywert: wait why can’t you get this acc to d1…?
[3:00:04] TheLiin: i got master with a full time job tbf
[3:00:11] quark978: My favorite strat is flashing over the nexus to get back to lane faster
[3:00:24] Lhadge: But also if you reach masters you need to play atleast one game before you start demoting, aint nobody got time for that
[3:00:24] S17Master: Could we all be better at at the game? Yes. Do we all care to get better really quick? Not necessarily. Did any of us FUCKING ASK? Probably not.
[3:00:31] watson1235: Swenken lies about his ELO. Don’t be like Swenken y’all 🤣
[3:00:45] IoSonoBatman: This game doesnt have new player anymore, everytime i play there are someone with 2013/2014 icon, that people are now more old and dont have so much time like in the past
[3:00:51] KimChiGaming1994: lucas had u up on his stream a moment ago
[3:00:55] watson1235: proud unranked former player here lol
[3:00:56] dalig_: daligCATcheer  WP
[3:01:25] Yuukily: In masters and above you have to play a few games to get ur decay games back
[3:01:27] Yuukily: which suck
[3:01:34] watson1235: 🤡s Gunna 🤡
[3:01:37] jareauu: i have a full time job and then go to university. i don’t even want to touch league of legends and not even on weekends hahah full time job gets u tired to even play a game
[3:01:38] KinKaray: Wait, there's people who enjoy playing league?? Kappa
[3:01:40] MrOnlyStitch: I play 3 games, I tilt i go read books xddd

[3:02:29] TheLiin: @nicolasxduarte yes
[3:02:33] iMadCuzBad: @nicolasxduarte Was just thinking this
[3:02:39] AzogDaAussie: @nicolasxduarte think so, displacements interrupt channels
[3:02:42] quark978: @nicolasxduarte yeah it displaces which breaks all channels
[3:03:07] TheLiin: its a knockup not a displace
[3:03:18] BroSevn: hey kaypea karım olurmusun ?

[3:05:00] KimChiGaming1994: i only really play league on my days off of work otherwise im playing my ps4
[3:05:08] lawfulevil_13: Oh yeah, working all day and family leaves me so empty that grinding competitive is just an extra headache I don't have in me. Regardless how much I want to or love it
[3:05:11] OsvaBoian: My kp said shes married, im so proud
[3:05:12] jimbob_ywert: @bing_pot21 Let’s relax a bit kaypPog
[3:05:15] OkayestGuy: Fulltime job, 3 year old, passions outside of gaming, still get games in. Just gotta want/enjoy it
[3:05:26] heia_ko: i left league for some time and came back here and there. but i totally lost for now mechanics and other stuff i had. this is life abd this is a game and this dude has no brain.

[3:06:39] OkayestGuy: You gotta be realistic about the skill cap your gonna have too
[3:06:41] Niomah: MY EYES! No, no twitch, that is NOT a channel I'd like no matter what you think. This whole adults only area stuff is just out of hand.
[3:06:48] ragtimediddly: I literally don't allow myself to play this game before I go to the gym in the evening otherwise I know it will bring me down and I just won't go lol
[3:06:57] Yuukily: something i wanted to bring up is that as someone who also almost hit masters, yes that did give me a boost to my ego but not as much as him ya know. I dont go saying waht rank i am to basically invalidate someone else's opinion
[3:07:01] nicolasxduarte: Wait, is camille support a thing now?
[3:07:13] inSINwetrust: "Dad, I'm hungry!" Wait. We eat when I hit Master Rank rooMadSlam
[3:07:23] AzogDaAussie: wait, how'd you get that? LUL
[3:07:26] hollus: i think a lot of league players have also been playing for so long they forget that some people are new. Learning how to play league has been painful because in norms ppl just wanna shit on others gameplay if they make a mistake
[3:07:28] heia_ko: it's sad that people are mixing knowledge and elo. 2 differents things. also kaypea you play many champs thats also a diff.
[3:07:33] quark978: @nicolasxduarte big thing in Korean solo q

[3:09:28] TheLiin: i actually havnt tried it myself, but its not a chargeup like the old herald
[3:09:29] AriMoonshadow: I'm pretty sure you can't wall the herald >_<
[3:09:32] ragtimediddly: is this a phrase I am too colonial to understand?
[3:09:33] dalig_: no hwei daligHoly

[3:11:01] Yuukily: Kels i saw a zoe take malignance and i was questioning reality. how does that even work LMAO
[3:11:04] TyrTheTiny: wait anivia doesn't use malignance? one would think it's a great item for her
[3:11:05] jimbob_ywert: Malignance on anivia? Yeah you deserve to be flamed kaypAnnoyed

[3:11:54] Niomah: It's not about the CD
[3:12:03] ObsceneSanity: 20 farm is worth a kill
[3:12:07] Niomah: Its about the MR reduction and the rest of the abil haste
[3:12:20] Flinkehh: @amethyst_art22 Oh no I didnt see that PepeHands
[3:12:27] league_of_d3pression: @kaypea people always bring up kda and it’s annoying. because I didn’t get 19372837183726 kills I did bad
[3:13:04] Yuukily: no cuz its based on dmg by someone's ulty
[3:13:05] ragtimediddly: fuck that minion in particular

[3:15:33] Sunnytinker: and they took away the health :(
[3:15:34] mostaf721: Are you winning?
[3:15:44] Yuukily: but it works with karma so would it work with the abilites after her ult ? im literally questioning everything LMAO
[3:15:59] jimbob_ywert: @insinwetrust I’d argue mages do the most damage in the game only looking at damage-wise
[3:16:10] Yuukily: LMAO
[3:16:11] jimbob_ywert: like situationally in games ofc
[3:16:15] Yuukily: that wall
[3:16:15] ragtimediddly: meanwhile, in the bot lane
[3:16:17] Niomah: @Yuukily Only if her ult is a boost of another abil
[3:16:21] heia_ko: @TyrTheTiny hahahaha tho i still think malignance isnt the best choice for her after consideration but that's imo
[3:16:24] quark978: well you are in theory easier to kill than a garen
[3:16:25] Niomah: Like Karmas
[3:16:25] jimbob_ywert: Mages can most of the time suck against other champs because of items
[3:16:39] mrshibasan: I like how riot made the passive description a little more simple to understand compare to last season that has mythic that made the passive desc sound fancy.
[3:16:39] Yuukily: @Niomah Zoe's Ult gives her passive

[3:25:53] FrozenFurda: btw, since I've missed out the last 5 years of this, did they move Vel back to mid or he still support? Susge
[3:26:11] Niomah: Vel'Koz: Death by Geometry!
[3:26:34] FrozenFurda: Dammit. Loved it more when he was suggested as mid pick LUL
[3:27:03] fmLkillU: hi i'm new at lol, do you have any advice?
[3:27:04] Niomah: I just play him in ARAM whenever I get the chance
[3:27:08] FiveFM: Vel'Koz: The attack always comes from the side. "Clever girl"
[3:27:31] FiveFM: #BadJurrassicParkReference
[3:27:46] kingdomofblue: play with chat off, that's what I do LUL
[3:27:51] Niomah: @fmLkillU Also try to learn a few champs for each role in case you get autofilled
[3:27:55] heia_ko: i do feel tho that brand is more suggested in support but actually his a good pick also mid, he is a tank deleter naturally.
[3:27:59] ericaborgest: sending positive vibes for last game kaypHarmony kaypHarmony
[3:28:07] FrozenFurda: @kingdomofblue So /muteall at start of match? LUL
[3:28:09] J_to_the_jf: I'd watch a few League 101 videos on how the game works Riot gives you NO tutorial
[3:28:17] Smoothcollie: @FrozenFurda Rito sadly moved some mages, originally midlaners to supp - Vel, Brand, Xer, Zyra Sadge
[3:28:30] Deveix: Main lux KEKW
[3:28:35] Robecker: !eu
[3:28:37] ragtimediddly: Also it helps you to find out what champ you're actually good at
[3:28:38] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[3:28:38] doctor0616: hey Kaypea ^^ gl <3
[3:28:45] Saffy1: i played an aram other day and got viktor, i didnt know how to use his e
[3:28:52] fmLkillU: okay, thank you guys
[3:28:57] Hymuno: just agree with toxic people, really throws them off. jungler called me blind for not helping him when my lane was pushed into me so i said I was and he said oh my bad LUL
[3:28:58] kingdomofblue: @FrozenFurda nah play with only "teamchat" on aka if you're not with a duo you dont see chat
[3:28:59] Niomah: I watch @KayPea and I watch several streamers Youtube vid uploads
[3:28:59] FrozenFurda: @Smoothcollie Thus, they became out of pocket picks for OG otp players ;)
[3:29:06] sabiirox: how did you’re last Anivia game go? Win or loss?
[3:29:10] ericaborgest: ppJedi
[3:29:15] heia_ko: @Smoothcollie i got once demolish by a zyra mid vs me as lux disgusting combo and dmg ^^'
[3:29:18] ragtimediddly: Turns out I'm good at Nidalee and fuckin horseshit at Lee Sin
[3:29:24] FiveFM: I've definitely been surprised by ARAM. Sometimes playing a champ I'd thought I'd hate but ended up enjoying.
[3:29:36] ericaborgest: PEPEDS
[3:29:41] heia_ko: the music is good !
[3:29:43] J_to_the_jf: that's partly why Ranked is so messed up in league they give you no tutorial and throw you in the deep end and say "have at it"
[3:29:51] Niomah: I'm aces on Veigar and Janna in ARAM
[3:30:01] Niomah: I would be on Lux and Morg but I almost never get them
[3:30:18] FiveFM: kaypRonin  <- Pet it here plz
[3:30:19] ragtimediddly: sympathy pot
[3:30:27] Niomah: I'm one token from Mastery 7 on Ahri as well
[3:30:30] sabiirox: isnt asol really weak rn after the hot fix?
[3:30:31] TheLiin: anivia is the waaaay
[3:30:33] heia_ko: letsgooooooo!
[3:30:35] shedfirekid1: nicely done!
[3:30:46] Femuline: idk why i’m just now realizing anivia has voice lines
[3:30:46] Smoothcollie: @FrozenFurda I loved playing Zyra mid, but she is not in the great spot there. Any counterpick will destroy you. She can be good, as @heia_ko pointed out, againts immobile mages. But that's all
[3:31:22] heia_ko: @Smoothcollie thats true
[3:31:25] FiveFM: No chicken nom noms for Horsey Mchorseyface
[3:31:36] heia_ko: @Smoothcollie ty for advice
[3:31:38] ragtimediddly: it's upsetting that none of her voice lines are just 'CAW CAW'
[3:31:50] Niomah: Yeah I realized I'm pretty darn good at Heimerdinger of all champs lol
[3:31:54] jimbob_ywert: bought to play a ranked game in silver 2! let’s hope I can get gold soon :)

[3:33:31] ericaborgest: kaypPog kaypPog
[3:33:31] shedfirekid1: so good kaypCheer kaypCheer
[3:33:35] Smoothcollie: @heia_ko kaypFlower For claryfing it up -  she is also immobile, without hard cc (root isnt hard cc I think?) So any assasin or mobile mage eats you
[3:33:39] jimbob_ywert: Birb vs Dragon.. who wins
[3:33:42] FiveFM: Come 'ere Imma peck your eyes out!
[3:33:47] Femuline: yesterday i learned asol counters yasuo bc his Q goes through wind wall XD
[3:33:50] FiveFM: kaypCheer
[3:33:57] jimbob_ywert: Asols saying fck it, I scale anyways
[3:34:09] yusuf_1591: @jimbob_ywert doesnt matter KP always win kaypComfy
[3:34:21] FrozenFurda: Vel Q also "ignores" Yas wall LUL
[3:34:24] Femuline: yeah it’s bc his Q isn’t a “projectile”
[3:34:30] Femuline: ^^
[3:35:11] FrozenFurda: Well "ignores" as in you fire it side of it then split it when it's in range of Yas LUL
[3:35:27] jimbob_ywert: Anything laser-like goes through Yasmin’s windwall. Windwall blocks projectiles, stuff like Lux Ult or Asol Q just goes through
[3:35:37] AzogDaAussie: @jimbob_ywert Yasmin LUL
[3:35:45] shedfirekid1: this is just unlucky
[3:35:54] Femuline: @jimbob_ywert picking asol into gas every time from now on xD

[3:36:52] Daddy_Shoe: my son's up from his nap so i have to go, have a good last game!
[3:37:10] Femuline: @fivefm ikr when u switch w someone in champ select they expect you to be 10/0/10 by minute 5
