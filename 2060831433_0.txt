[0:22:52] backschmackup: how is jhin terrible?
[0:22:53] gunwsp: who is better champ between nilah and samira? they look kinda similar for me
[0:22:54] Kiistip: i think nilah scales way better than jhin but is way worse early
[0:22:58] ttaters: !dad reveal
[0:23:00] nossiwt: poor naayil got yamato
[0:23:27] kardanlm: ahhh makes sense
[0:23:27] ttaters: spoken like a true expert

[0:23:30] staczhez: jhin sniper
[0:23:30] intingkarthus: :tf:
[0:23:32] muuyaa__: need more boolets
[0:23:33] reandrox: i think Jhin depends on comp, but has great range for pickups with R and W
[0:23:48] ELIZER_37: jhin no damage???
[0:23:50] final_zangetsu: jhin is fine he is just playing top
[0:23:54] Nightbot: SUB TO THE YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxCj-vRQhoyGCUhI-nP4lA
[0:23:54] intingkarthus: jhin is only good when there's a lot of aoe damage and cc
[0:24:05] muuyaa__: what is this game, ryze and nilah huuuuuuuuuh
[0:24:05] ivaan_lol: jinx is broken with lulu but jhin with an engage support is so annoyinh
[0:24:13] tommmmmmassssss: it would be too broken bro
[0:24:21] tommmmmmassssss: how the fuck are u catchin a jhin then
[0:24:24] RedonicRedfire: jhin gets countered by one cloth armor on a frontliner lol
[0:24:27] armin0992: still hitting the gym?
[0:24:32] ダミッコス: jhin is kinda weird he is good only early lane with engage lane or super lategame
[0:24:34] kramster2003: Jhin only acceptable bc movement speed
[0:24:40] tommmmmmassssss: yea sure but the ms is insane
[0:24:42] ttaters: its like yeah he can hit for 900 with one auto a second but the other adcs do 50 per auto 2 times a second
[0:24:42] intingkarthus: also jhin can't damage hard tanks
[0:24:43] ivaan_lol: but it's riots fault bc they made jhin a lethality champ

[0:24:54] kardanlm: AHAHAH mage moment
[0:25:05] peekachu: Bro you look like you got older twice this year
[0:25:09] tommmmmmassssss: like imagine he dealt same damage and on top of that he just gets +400 ms per auto
[0:25:20] qaalida: yo while i was playing aatrox in last game i noticed that aatrox does not have shoes on this skin
[0:25:23] ダミッコス: and needs better spacing and can't really do much vs true tanks
[0:25:24] MadrialXD: The issue with giving him the equivalent dps to jinx would make him too good since he didnt have to "kite" in the same way as others do?
[0:25:37] random67596: He basically point and clicked you, such a skilled Champion
[0:25:44] intingkarthus: Ryze
[0:25:45] armin0992: no MR??
[0:25:48] vertexwastakenn: Nj mr
[0:25:53] tommmmmmassssss: it would just become ranged hecarim or lillia jhin dont u think?
[0:26:00] zhmido: ryze is hidden op
[0:26:00] tommmmmmassssss: he would have 0 downsides legit
[0:26:00] ttaters: roa seraphs stillmakes mages unkillable

[0:26:21] ELIZER_37: what do you think about lethality aatrox?
[0:26:28] hak1ng6: VoteNay VoteNay
[0:26:37] yunglul: i won lane against ryze once he brought frozen heart dealt more damage to me then i did to him and i died
[0:26:37] armin0992: he has the shield item though
[0:26:39] yunglul: so balanced
[0:26:48] ivaan_lol: ROA + Seraphs embrace gives him a lot of shield and health

[3:17:20] pan_con_chicharr0n: thankfully they only play it lethality in competitive
[3:17:25] Bleskzzz: but i dont think profane is core rn
[3:17:27] swisslion2806: lets go
[3:17:31] pan_con_chicharr0n: so they might nerft lethality items

[3:18:21] jamerlengo0: he has a lot of play rate i think thats why
[3:18:23] hewhocomz: is nasus getting buffed
[3:18:28] ehsan024: How comes they dont go sundered in pro games?

[3:18:35] league_of_d3pression: Aatrox is broken in the hands of a good player
[3:18:35] Laigstore: I think he is balanced, when I go against him seems fair
[3:18:38] mfs_nasa: his win rate low because he is weak late game?
[3:18:48] Nightbot: Join the Discord for Notifications https://discord.gg/naayil
[3:18:54] Bleskzzz: Dude, aatrox needs a +1850rp skin
[3:19:08] abduahmed: Bros
[3:19:10] Juli7605: why no bone plating when this rune is so broken against garen
[3:19:15] z3ycke: ksante is more broken, if they touch aatrox they have to touch ksante first
[3:19:19] mfs_nasa: but he is weak late game
[3:19:23] pluomm: why no drown shield
[3:19:23] Laigstore: Thats the case for most champs
[3:19:23] mfs_nasa: i feel useless
[3:19:27] cheerios20203: what are the examples of champions that are broken even without a good player?
[3:19:30] pan_con_chicharr0n: @Juli7605 bone plating is ass vs garen
[3:19:32] Holymanster: why no sudden impact ?
[3:19:34] lord_raavan: aatrox is okay balanced, naayil is broken
[3:19:35] Bleskzzz: they are touching ksante all the time
[3:19:39] mfs_nasa: his e

[3:19:53] luca_sala__: @naayil hi nayill, I'm hardstuck iron 4 playng aatrox 3 hours a day, any advice ?
[3:19:54] Bleskzzz: that would be so badasss
[3:19:54] Juli7605: ye but when he does no dmg
[3:19:56] z3ycke: ksante has to be removed ideally tbh
[3:19:59] PoUwUer: so true
[3:20:03] dinamaquinajetta: MARVIN 1V9 WITHOUT SINGED  lol
[3:20:07] mfs_nasa: the kit itself is busted
[3:20:26] cheerios20203: what state is naafiri in right now?
[3:20:28] z3ycke: at least aatrox needs skill to play, then yes hes OP, but ksante.....
[3:20:30] pan_con_chicharr0n: @Juli7605 but boneplating is only an early game rune, so when garen start doing dmg rune will be useless imo
[3:20:31] lolmarto3: Have you tried profane EoN serylda? What is your opinion on this build
[3:20:33] trashboatxtd: ksante looks like a dota2 champ
[3:20:35] swisslion2806: remove true dmg from his passive

[3:22:18] Yujibro: isnt that garen a fkng singed main? @Naayil
[3:22:18] cheerios20203: why did he pick garen
[3:22:24] PoUwUer: such unbalanced champs like kasante are not fun to play with, it ruins experiance
[3:22:25] Bleskzzz: yeah but u have to think about some stuff, right know ksante has little  to no skill. At s13, u could tap ksante W, no need to charge it, it had more skill than rn, i think rn they just buffed all of his stats to the point his kit is just broken and for brainless people
[3:22:38] random67596: they should icrease the damage minions deal to you when you are too far from them
[3:22:38] Chinese_Spyy: Ahahahah the marvin
