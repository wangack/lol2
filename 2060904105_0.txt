[0:48:28] ChaseShaco: play what u enjoy but u can make the game so easy
[0:48:31] MccStabby: Find another iron players to duo with and hope it balances itself out :D
[0:48:38] ChaseShaco: its easier to imrpopve when yuo just have to learn how to jungle

[0:49:21] ChaseShaco: clown collge is the name of the playlist
[0:50:43] CNcharacter: is viego that bad?
[0:50:50] CNcharacter: ive enjoyed him
[0:50:51] MccStabby: Hey, look at that! An AP mid!
[0:50:52] dasaniarmani: hes hard to play well
[0:51:09] dasaniarmani: compared to say, ww or hec
[0:51:43] theoilbaron98: Playing Viego required you to know what every other champ in the game does as well for his passive.
[0:51:50] CNcharacter: really? hmmm ok ill try and figure 2 champs to really hone in
[0:52:10] dadoey: add kappapenis plz
[0:52:16] dasaniarmani: LUL
[0:53:13] CESlush: One of the other things I don't think is said enough about learning the game, is play ARAM.  You learn about the different champs and how they work.
[0:53:21] dadoey: bro nidaalee doesnt even feels trong i stg
[0:53:21] Nightbot: bro
[0:53:26] TheExecutor: Mord and amumu are good easy jungle champs for low elo.

[0:54:54] prismaticalpr: aram is full 20 minutes of mechanic practice
[0:55:10] NofapGymColdShowers: when i was actively playing i picked up the aram warmup trick from you and it made me so much better
[0:55:12] ChaseShaco: fuck it
[0:55:12] Vilyanare: @squidman36_ That's the point though.  The guy is semi new so he doesn't have a basic understanding.
[0:55:15] ChaseShaco: squad aram>?
[0:55:31] OceanBuffalo: i'm in
[0:55:39] TheExecutor: @chaseshaco curious have you seen an qiyana jungles this season?

[1:55:13] foojonas: @chaseshaco change name of the runepage, it will help
[1:55:31] Skyz_Ninjaz: @ChaseShaco if it has the dash as the name of your rune page its bugged. To be safe press the button to edit it, change 1 thing then change it back and press save in top right
[1:55:51] ChaseShaco: so nuts
[1:56:01] ChaseShaco: that i have to stop the billion dollar game from ghriefing m,e

[1:57:15] emhx: have to check them like 5 times to make sure it ever saved
[1:57:55] Dela3asensei: what was that aids music on tf clip
[1:58:00] false_monk: The best solution is just make costume rune page and dont use the dash one. Custome pages never bug
[1:59:18] Skyz_Ninjaz: Oh also, it is gonna be very common if you used a recommended rune page the previous game. so after you play an ARAM or whatever, make sure you really double check it
