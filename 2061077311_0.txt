[0:06:21] luisthemexican6: DONT EVER PLAY SETT SUPPORT YALL IF YALL MAIN SUPPORT
[0:06:22] SeitanLoL: Vlad does way too much damage for someone that is: a pseudo tank, no mana, built in omnivamp, long range, and invulnerability skill. But that's just my unbiased opinion
[0:06:23] NomadNoah: Yea for League, 250 games total. I'm still omega new
[0:07:01] luisthemexican6: I‚Äôm calm now peaceful vibes ‚úåÔ∏è

[0:10:54] WizardPug: red card tho
[0:11:02] wwaterbearer: he had to wait for gold
[0:11:07] hzjumps: can you recast tf w during cc?
[0:11:53] voidheart_1: What does Twisted Fate's R do?
[0:11:59] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Enchanter
[0:12:01] Nightbot: eat glue, drool on keyboard, mental boom, head hit desk.
[0:12:11] SeitanLoL: Idk what type of shitty slight of hand TF does that reveals what card he draws to everyone else
[0:12:16] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Yeah
[0:12:22] cerealkillas22: Tbf lil caesars is kinda shitty
[0:12:22] wwaterbearer: yea
[0:12:25] lethalbonsai: @voidheart_1 gives vision of enemies and tp
[0:12:27] wwaterbearer: thats how its been all season
[0:12:30] bernice4: bernice4 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Good luck!
[0:12:32] wwaterbearer: and second half of last season
[0:12:35] hzjumps: @voidheart_1 it reveals everybody on the map and then he can recast to tp a large distance
[0:12:39] voidheart_1: @wwaterbearer thanks
[0:12:40] littlelightni: dominos better
[0:12:43] limecat_t: No its valid to feel like that tbh
[0:12:48] wwaterbearer: @voidheart_1 np
[0:13:03] Dacnomaniak: Nah I used to Manage a Little Caecars I made bomb ass pizza for myself
[0:13:05] cerealkillas22: Hehe your a funny man taco
[0:13:05] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Yo Taco Can you play Aphelios to distract your mind from your shitty teammates by reading his ability notes
[0:13:29] wwaterbearer: also what does red and blue cards for for TF?
[0:13:43] hzjumps: red card slows and deals damage in an aoe on impact
[0:13:47] SaltedIIIBlueberries: No player on Contenders I've been queuing for 45minutes
[0:13:49] hzjumps: blue card restores mana and does the most damage
[0:13:53] wwaterbearer: ty ty
[0:13:58] lethalbonsai: @wwaterbearer blue deals more ap dmg and gives mana while red does aoe dmg and slows
[0:14:38] SaltedIIIBlueberries: T√†co on jhin fetish
[0:14:48] littlelightni: that build looks fun
[0:15:27] SaltedIIIBlueberries: That how low elo play juke you
[0:15:29] wwaterbearer: that jhin had it out for u
[0:15:32] limecat_t: The Lulu laugh i cant üíÄ
[0:16:00] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Yep, imagine getting bounty on you because you have a really cs score
[0:16:24] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Deja vu
[0:16:29] littlelightni: ff@15 mentality is the worst
[0:16:35] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Good**
[0:16:49] limecat_t: So true
[0:17:23] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Maybe try different region?
[0:17:35] NomadNoah: I think it's more about the structure of the game than the player pool
[0:17:43] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Could you try play on SG/MY server? I wanna know your opinion
[0:18:15] alinator7: while you might be right as a league player, you may not be right as a streamer. at the end of the day, people like to watch your god-tier jhin and youre streaming for content. but if its affecting your mental then yeah its def justified
[0:18:29] hzjumps: mhm?
[0:18:33] alinator7: i just think you may not be looking at it in the right way but what do i know
[0:18:36] hzjumps: i love foils
[0:18:46] hzjumps: yea they showed me the screenshot it was so wholesome DFSGSKDFH

[0:19:25] Nightbot: dogshit kerfuckle perma clowning around throwing shit at each other, APES TOGETHER STRONG
[0:19:45] mystdemon: Sounds like an avg league player
[0:19:47] wwaterbearer: yeah idk why people feel a need to be shitty when u just ask a question
[0:19:54] SaltedIIIBlueberries: This, I told my teammates something and jungle asked me to stfu
[0:19:57] mystdemon: @SaltedIIIBlueberries worse in EU I think XD speaking as eu player
[0:20:01] wwaterbearer: like bro i was asking to put a ward down why are you so hostile
[0:20:09] Cptn_Lenny: Damn sub my sub got swallowed
[0:20:09] chiikovita: its hilarious whenever i hear people say "its just normal league" LIKE NO THATS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR
[0:20:12] Cptn_Lenny: Sob
[0:20:13] Scizor021: Hey now, i got banned for going 1/11 against a diamond Riven mid smurfing in silver
[0:20:15] limecat_t: I get people like this everytime i play ranked to the point where i have given up
[0:20:18] demonminer3: @wwaterbearer cuz you're dumb for even asking a question and not knowing the answer already. and people HATE dumb people on the team.
[0:20:22] xlAlexanderIx: @mystdemon normally i agree but this season na feels extra weird
[0:20:48] wwaterbearer: @demonminer3 ??? asking to put a ward down isn't dumb?
[0:20:49] SaltedIIIBlueberries: What is that Smolder skin? It look like a cat
[0:20:54] SaltedIIIBlueberries: Turret tf
[0:20:58] demonminer3: @wwaterbearer it is to them, and thats all that matters
[0:21:03] wwaterbearer: oooh
[0:21:08] Cptn_Lenny: I used my prime
[0:21:10] HawkeyeTwoTen: @scizor021 you don't get banned for being bad. You get banned for griefing or being toxic so there'd definitely more to that match than you're saying
[0:21:12] weirdoofkings: wait why haven't you taken q?
[0:21:26] Cptn_Lenny: Lemme reset real quick :>
[0:21:27] peshecito: peshecito subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 44 months! Can't thank enough for the good times thorough all this time. Have a nice day Taquito, oh, oh may I get a ikeepitFOUR for old times? ikeepitRAREOMG
[0:21:27] demonminer3: @wwaterbearer sucks, but thats how people think. or, the approximation of that
[0:21:33] wwaterbearer: i feel like its people trying to act more badass and edgy as if that's gonna inflate their elo
[0:21:46] weirdoofkings: you gotta take it eventually no?
[0:21:49] Cptn_Lenny: Cptn_Lenny subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Ayyyy
[0:21:52] wwaterbearer: yea, it's just. honestly not even fun to play. we don't need vanguard for cheaters we need toxic people to actually be punished
[0:21:53] Cptn_Lenny: There we go!
[0:22:01] wwaterbearer: not used to artificially deflate good players' elo.
[0:22:05] VioletShino: VioletShino subscribed with Prime. 
[0:22:11] demonminer3: @wwaterbearer well, we also need vanguard for cheaters. those guys are lame too
[0:22:19] Cptn_Lenny: been a while again, I haven't been watching streams ay all hshfhd
[0:22:25] peshecito: ikeepitLOVERBOI  AYYYY FOURTY FOUUUUR I'm so happy ahahha
[0:22:27] Scizor021: @HawkeyeTwoTen surprisingly no. Everyone did report me for feeding, but i never really engage with chat in this game. That said, it was also months ago and gave me reason enough to stop playing
[0:22:32] wwaterbearer: like its literally in the riot released description of how MMR works. to lower winrates they put players with people that have been reported for poor sportsmanship
[0:22:42] chiikovita: YA GRANDPA
[0:23:00] demonminer3: politics is a clown show right now anyways
[0:23:08] peshecito: ikeepitBOOMER

[0:24:19] HawkeyeTwoTen: But hey they got 2 hostages right?
[0:24:22] HawkeyeTwoTen: Balance
[0:24:26] HoleyShirt1: problem with the internet is its impersonal and people can consume w.e. they want and can do or say w.e. they want too
[0:24:27] HawkeyeTwoTen: Sarcasm
[0:24:31] cu_de_sanfona: When are you going to do the Urgot botlane collab?
[0:24:33] „Éä„É§„É™„Ç¢„Éï: free palestine and also me. i am trapped inside myself
[0:24:45] cu_de_sanfona: oh my bad didn't notice there was a serious topic going on

[0:28:14] RisenSeraph: I'm surprised that people build Beserker greaves when you so often max out on Attack Speed on these builds. Is it just that important early game?

[1:46:17] shadow_boi1: I thought it was me
[1:46:18] skitter_bb: I double checked myself and I don't have Steam open myself
[1:46:20] shadow_boi1: KEKW
[1:46:38] BulldogsBiteBack: i bet taco double clicks on his potions to use them
[1:46:52] Aethersen: he levels up by clicking them
[1:47:20] shadow_boi1: He opens the shop by pressing the button under his items
[1:47:38] BulldogsBiteBack: wait thats functional
[1:47:39] kaiserwroth: Adge
[1:47:58] BulldogsBiteBack: stupid butterfinger ad
[1:47:58] primogemwanter69: Why yall flaming wtf xD
[1:49:21] skitter_bb: that Vi is a dumbass lmao
[1:49:31] xDicTaterx: apparently being jhin mid is on par to being 3 levels down top lane xD what a mindset
[1:49:50] ToneDoLOL: first frame i join the stream its a 4th shot LETSGO
[1:49:50] Nightbot: So this is your FIRST stream here, welcome! We say 4, miss cannons, and NEVER blame our supports :D
[1:49:58] ramisaffour: yeah the jhin mid is the only one playing the game
[1:50:07] skitter_bb: exactly, Taco is the only one not feeding and somehow he's being talked down on lol
[1:50:17] primogemwanter69: @ikeepittaco  why do you still build ghostblade after nerfs?
[1:50:59] suitzero0: Oof
[1:50:59] A1NCRADY: I think the movespeed was the only nerf, dmg is still fine
[1:51:03] Ogolikus1982: Fiora'd
[1:51:04] toddy_0122: fiora is definetly a champion
[1:51:21] primogemwanter69: @a1ncrady  ms was what made it worth no?

[1:51:55] K1ts0ni: Winnable Kappa
[1:51:56] seitomate: just another Fiora casually remembering your what happen when top isn't behind
[1:52:15] A1NCRADY: @primogemwanter69 I guess but I mean, it‚Äôs still a good item nonetheless
[1:52:20] warlock2750: Corki butt HUH
[1:52:26] BulldogsBiteBack: what elo is this, the positioning always funnyyy
[1:52:49] demonminer3: @BulldogsBiteBack high enough for them to know better
[1:53:03] primogemwanter69: @a1ncrady  collector rush is probably best after they nerfed ghostblade but its really up to the player
[1:53:33] A1NCRADY: I really don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt play adc XD
[1:53:36] BulldogsBiteBack: i have such a hard time giving up crit chance for some reason
[1:54:14] demonminer3: @BulldogsBiteBack crit damage is amazing when you actually get to building it. but you need like 3-4 items before it actually is stronger than lethality
[1:54:41] lina819: hi
[1:54:44] hakushin: catJAM
[1:55:02] demonminer3: games are usually pretty decided by then though, so unless you're relying on crit spikes to turn a game around, it's better to go lethality
[1:55:36] auto__attack: talkative bunch
[1:56:00] pikachuchu00: Taco is the best
[1:56:12] skitter_bb: HE DID IT! FLASH 4TH SHOT!

[1:59:46] Ogolikus1982: Fiddle'd
[1:59:46] browy_eu: Senna support is always kind of a backup adc LUL
[1:59:54] BulldogsBiteBack: senna pops off in 1/10 games. otherwise they cant justify senna sup

[3:00:20] wildskar_: @IKeepItTaco thanks to your guides im 1 game off diamond as jhin otp :)
[3:00:31] 1stbiwin: why the supports have to be so selfish and don't play for thier adc's? it's so frustrating playing this roll
[3:00:54] 1stbiwin: i feel you
[3:00:59] heincken: lol finally a kind team
[3:01:15] 1stbiwin: you lose the mid matchup right?
[3:01:32] naidex1: Now imagine playing ADC in gold with supports who dont have game fundamentals :D
[3:01:46] naidex1: trying to fight Draven in lane

[3:02:37] warlock2750: Randow kat otp
[3:02:38] AzureHazz: i hate they're going away with the support role. It used to be "support the adc" but now its just about poking and one-shottinr or perma roaming
[3:02:40] ChaiinWardenn: he's playing rn
[3:02:54] 079skywalker: games are also shorter so supports try to help the lanes that can make more difference in the early game (jg and early-game midlaners)
[3:03:00] shamat01: Not him
[3:03:01] naidex1: At this point I prefer 1 Champ at every lane with 2 Junglers and more camps to farm :D
[3:03:05] 1stbiwin: what build is the best for jhin in this moment?

[3:09:27] warlock2750: He had negative wr that is why
[3:09:32] warlock2750: Has*
[3:09:37] Mcsevem77: tbh the only way to nerf rumble is to complain on twitter
[3:09:45] fevgatos_live: but is rumble a popular pick? like is so freakin boring champ to play
[3:09:46] XChaoLanX: they might think that he makes fights exciting with his ult Shruge

[3:09:49] SaltedIIIBlueberries: It's like riot phroxon with the all chat thing?
