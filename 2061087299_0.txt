[2:55:02] LoLRankBot: pobelter is Challenger  951 LP
[2:55:11] nekroz2k: ??? What happened there
[2:55:13] Qualdum: clone just kills you without counterplay. you cant kill it or it fears you and you cant not kill it
[2:55:39] Anemonay: hi poobelter
[2:55:41] smartiekidd: just had a 30 minute game where a kassadin did 7.7k champ dps

[2:59:01] Cruzerthebruzer: just need to auto him 300 times Pog
[2:59:02] livebryan: issue with this build is youre relying on passive procs to do the damage (hence guinsoos) rather than kraken, but passive scales with ap
[2:59:03] aquaticIntrovert: wonder, if you both stood still, how long you'd have to spend autoing udyr before he died

[3:00:40] DiddyWick: That udyr fella does not look right
[3:00:41] klantfan: close, it looked like you got udyr down to 95% for a splitsecond
[3:00:41] randomtwitchmoose: no sums no win
[3:00:45] Leftyalex: @honeymustard91 S2 , was G3 mid /supp last szn but idk i find the most self reiability with adc'ing
[3:00:45] Umbracious: kaisa just has a really shitty build path rn
[3:00:48] unagi_densetsu: close
[3:00:48] smartiekidd: @Daniblitz google what a smartie is
[3:00:48] vvartin: @Leftyalex she has two great self peel abilities, and oretty good damage without anyone buffing her, i dont think shes on the team dependant side of adcs
[3:00:49] Umbracious: and not even damage
[3:00:54] Umbracious: not enough*
[3:00:57] rascal500: should have taken MR runes
[3:01:05] honeymustard91: udyr top really needs a nerf imo, increase his empowered cast mana costs please PepeHands
[3:01:07] Electric4ce: Do you not go crit kaisa anymore?
[3:01:11] umop_aplsdn: @Leftyalex imo she is team dependent you definitely need people with cc on your team
[3:01:16] umop_aplsdn: like at least 2 ccs
[3:01:20] Praetor_GG: kaisa's whole design is really ass if you break it down, too snowflakey
[3:01:21] umop_aplsdn: otherwise she feels kinda bad
[3:01:27] Umbracious: @umop_aplsdn thats every adc
[3:01:30] Umbracious: lol
[3:01:38] Leftyalex: @umop_aplsdn ah got it hahaha but it is like ev adc
[3:01:50] umop_aplsdn: she needs it more than other adcs
[3:01:50] Leftyalex: @Umbracious ez can self peel
[3:01:59] umop_aplsdn: like it feels really bad if you play kaisa without your team helping you
[3:02:00] michaelvolkov_: dogs went too pee with him
[3:02:05] ttv_zhangbang: varus twitch ez ashe jhin dont need cc on teammates
[3:02:08] Nammipoki: the eclipse > nashors > shadowflame > collector / dcap build is so much stronger for Kai’sa fr
[3:02:17] Daniblitz: @smartiekidd Ok, maybe i don’t know what it meant, assumed «kid who’s smart» mb. But nn ur comment to guy who makes lighthearted fun remark to your fully understandable typo though? Imo, be kind
[3:02:18] 5uluguni: @smartiekidd Smarties are color-varied sugar-coated dragée chocolate confectionery SUSSY
[3:02:24] zer088: @praetor_gg kaisas design is beatiful

[3:02:34] abcdefghijklmnopqrsxyz: :)
[3:02:37] BeefBiggly: !byedog
[3:02:57] SteelTempestx: @BeefBiggly thats atticus
[3:03:01] honeymustard91: @Leftyalex the issue with adc is its such a fragile role, jungler will (almost) always be able to 1v1 you unless youre very ahead. imo to balance it out, learn something like draven - steep learning curve but if you get the hang of movement and axes and e timing, you can win 1v2/1v3 somewhat regularly against most bot lanes pretty early on
[3:03:01] Praetor_GG: @zer088 her game design FeelsWeirdMan
[3:03:08] kaerl_: botlane is one out of 3 things: you join the seraphine mafia, play poke like varus, or play scaling hypercarry like aphelios and pray you team doesnt run it
[3:03:11] honeymustard91: holy essaying
[3:03:15] Grogswag: clap
[3:03:16] BeefBiggly: @steeltempestx the lawyer?

[3:04:00] mfino: noxus propaganda in the chat
[3:04:00] Praetor_GG: @zer088 a boring interaction maybe
[3:04:01] honeymustard91: draven/kalista imo free elo until around plat when mid/jungle actually know to pound those champs into the dirt from lv2
[3:04:11] unagi_densetsu: adc are very baby need support help

[3:04:35] Cruzerthebruzer: just don't get cold bro
[3:04:43] honeymustard91: but its only going to work if you can skill gap your enemy, so if youve never played these champs before therell be a steep learning curve
[3:04:44] SOGOS: o7
[3:04:49] Daniblitz: @smartiekidd U said kass did 7.7k dps in a 30min game. 7.7k dmg would be low, but if dps is like 13m dmg
[3:04:55] Leftyalex: @honeymustard91 whatcha think bout ez
