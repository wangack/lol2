[0:33:03] ThexCatmanx: Why not do a costreamer lead tourney? It could be so hype
[0:33:03] ellipticalmalcontent: they should do what lck did for the opening of the season, with like team top vs team jg etc

[0:44:44] Tzames: IMT went from 4-14 with revenge to 5-13 with solo
[0:44:47] artvandelay32: @BeepImaJeep2015 no they sacrifice time so they are obliged to get a spot ... obviously
[0:44:49] Tzames: lol

[0:46:14] Fudgenator: True
[0:46:15] j_tripper: true
[0:46:19] Nize2: river and inspired are higher atm whos 3rd?
[0:46:21] Hack377: Good take
[0:46:22] xxjul1anaxx: players association needs to exercise labor solidarity again to get better conditions in the league. Riot gave out scraps after last push
[0:46:31] ThexCatmanx: River, Inspired and Contractz. I can see it
[0:46:34] Tzames: @pausechamp52 1968 olympics
[0:46:36] Archique: Gesture at Sej ults
[0:46:41] Pita26: @Nize2 contractz maybe?
[0:46:43] turtle_empire: nah blaber 3rd
[0:46:50] leamfor: @ThexCatmanx Contractz isn't having that great of a split either
[0:46:56] daisydupe23: umti playing p well rn too
[0:46:59] ChainingDemon: Exyu is the goat
[0:47:01] Ikancast: he said inspired has been good, river is always at the top and exyu has been surprisingly good
[0:47:09] leamfor: Umti is 3rd
[0:47:11] Nazhjin: river is on another level
[0:47:26] melancholywriter: Umti! hes cool
[0:47:31] ThexCatmanx: @leamfor I would disagree. He has been the sole strong point for NRG to me
[0:47:33] Spawnthecaster: Umti is a gigachad
[0:47:35] j_tripper: river is a psychopath
[0:47:36] pausechamp52: noah is crazy

[0:47:54] yanya7701: so top 3 LCS junglers are all imports. What a surprise
[0:47:59] desemaia: Umti thinks he is River LUL
[0:47:59] melancholywriter: I like how he blast coned asol back into the fight and ended
[0:48:06] ADrugge: Blaber just doesn't look strong in this meta. Allergic to landing skills on Rell.
[0:48:15] ArkSoftware: @yanya7701 xdd
[0:48:21] pausechamp52: umti Pog
[0:48:24] HalfAKnight: @yanya7701 Exyu isn't an import tho
[0:48:25] shawstinn: EDGE
[0:48:32] azztomouth69420: raz edging umti pog
[0:48:32] daisydupe23: c9 could go 0-10 and ppl b like c9 best team in lcs
[0:48:34] RudeDinosaur: you would what Umti?
[0:48:39] yanya7701: @HalfAKnight who is not top 3
[0:48:52] HalfAKnight: @yanya7701 :)
[0:48:58] leamfor: Inspired has such strong lanes, though, so it's hard.
[0:49:05] ProteusWest: I think that C9 looks like they're kind of lost as a team overall, that definitely doesn't make a jungler look great either
[0:49:08] yanya7701: contractz were sht this split
[0:49:11] artvandelay32: contractz has not been playing well this split what..
[0:49:12] Nize2: contractz and blaber are having similar splits

[0:49:42] Tameablebread93: it’s not about who is better it’s about who is currently playing better
[0:49:47] Ikancast: the jungler pool is pretty stacked
[0:49:52] andytherat_: delusional caller
[0:50:14] a_large_farvaaaa: kobe is top half lcs jungler
[0:50:18] leamfor: Blaber, Contractz, and Umti have all been inconsistent imo
[0:50:24] Tameablebread93: I don’t think this is a delusional take. I think you can craft an argument for it
[0:50:26] Spawnthecaster: bugi for top 3
[0:50:29] Spawnthecaster: mydream lcs
[0:50:30] ArkSoftware: nah bro OUR MAYO is 1st
[0:50:31] turtle_empire: blaber got a mastercard week 1 and he not 3rd?
[0:50:32] Tameablebread93: I don’t agree but it’s not insane
[0:50:36] Revenge: #mydreamLCS
[0:50:39] DeeJay_USA: sniper rookie of the split, quid MVP
[0:50:40] Revenge: 🐐
[0:50:43] OG_Plumwick: only in lane
[0:50:46] Tzames: what about the take
[0:50:51] leamfor: Not hard to be better than APA LUL
[0:50:52] numiiigoesrawrz: revenge our goat
[0:50:53] j_tripper: blaber has looked terrible though, probably  most disgusting rell I’ve seen
[0:50:53] Lyghtsaber: jojo is the imposter
[0:50:54] OG_Plumwick: jojo is an inter out of lane this split
[0:50:55] stephcurrysim: are yall discussing whether someones scorelines have been top 3 of whether the player is top 3 in their role in the region? because contractz sleepwalks into top 3 in the region what am i listening to
[0:50:57] desemaia: Quid is better than Jojo
[0:51:02] daisydupe23: jojo carrying c9 on his back
[0:51:12] GeneralSniper: who is that behind you bro @Revenge
[0:51:14] GeneralSniper: d1 police?????
[0:51:15] yanya7701: @daisydupe23 yeah no
[0:51:19] Tameablebread93: Quid has been playing better than almost all the kids imo
[0:51:27] Tameablebread93: mids*
[0:51:30] Nazhjin: joj ran it down hard
[0:51:48] DeeJay_USA: @generalsniper stream more 😤
[0:51:58] Pita26: jojo has had some really troll games, but he feels like the only one on C9 that does anything too

[0:53:12] Hack377: Berserker has been had super weird decisions this season in a lot of games
[0:53:13] the1andonlycorbin: not a fan of Blaber on tanks

[0:53:36] yanya7701: @Pita26 yes and Lucian does not work in the West. No one in the West has the ability to make that pick effective
[0:53:43] Pita26: I'm a huge Berserker fan but he's definitely griefed games this split for sure
[0:53:45] rudeclawlol: revenge C9 superfan

[0:54:55] leamfor: @Revenge Please replace Fudge, you're my GOAT 🙏 🐐
[0:55:16] stephcurrysim: blabers engages on rell have been objectively bad tho compared to his level of play on other junglers, its not some conspiracy
[0:55:20] kopaka7: think they were saying rell doesn't suit blabber's jungle style
[0:56:18] melancholywriter: It seems like NRG coms dont sound nice as before

[0:57:11] leamfor: @melancholywriter Yeah, they all look so mad every game.
[0:57:22] j_tripper: recency bias
[0:57:22] Tameablebread93: exyu has unironically played great
[0:57:26] ThexCatmanx: Exyu has been better than I expected
[0:57:33] ArkSoftware: dignitas did have 2-0 week
[0:57:37] Tameablebread93: there’s only BEEN recency to go off
[0:57:40] ChainingDemon: exyu easily top 3
[0:57:45] ChainingDemon: imo
[0:57:49] Fudgenator: Exyu has been good
[0:57:49] ixbx: Exyu is over performing the expectations for him... but very mid overall his noc ints in the noc ori game they threw clear issues on his part and he ack that
[0:57:57] d3xy_h: blaber is top 1 until c9 loses in playoffs imo

[1:29:40] Hack377: True, NBA trade deadline just happened and guys were getting blindsided left and right
[1:29:42] zerovisible: bro that's how i felt when failing my last class would get me kicked out of uni

[1:30:01] bowenchung: 👆
[1:30:07] Spawnthecaster: but im just saying this is legit every competitive sport
[1:30:17] bowenchung: 👆

[1:30:35] Revenge: @Spawnthecaster agreege
[1:30:53] trespasur: @Revenge ur the fucking goat man, will miss you very much
[1:30:53] karlheinzstockfootage: esports do not make money tho
[1:31:04] worvansuns: Heeeeeeere we go LUL
[1:31:15] worvansuns: Get Nick Saban in there KKona
[1:31:27] ellipticalmalcontent: @Spawnthecaster idk i feel like there is more leeway in other sports sometimes, a rookie will get 2+ years, versus in lcs they might get half a year
[1:31:28] desemaia: @Spawnthecaster nah Esports is way more extreme.
[1:31:43] razlol: yeah its most sports
[1:31:44] yanya7701: @dalimccubist they do otherwise esports would not exist
[1:31:45] Yamatron: some kids leave home at 15 to play hockey.....
[1:31:46] knocknockout: lol natural upbringing...
[1:31:57] Polowy: Based, fucking someone up then saying "Therapy" after the fact is a terrible idea of how things work, too many young immature people in positions of power in esports
[1:31:58] Spawnthecaster: disagree @desemaia ask any college athlete how competitive there field is
[1:32:00] razlol: but atleast major sports have the support staff and investment to cover
[1:32:18] Yamatron: @razlol not on the come up
[1:32:18] Spawnthecaster: also this is the correct take from Revenge. We are pro gamers cause we played games for 12 hours a day. which isnt typical / healthy
[1:32:22] karlheinzstockfootage: um i think, if you think that peaked out at your job at 21 is gross
[1:32:23] cubdave: @Yamatron there is a whole support system in the minors to help kids.  LoL isn't close to this.
[1:32:37] desemaia: @Spawnthecaster pro vs college much different tho. especially if u are talking major sports baseball, soccer, football, basketball.
[1:32:37] dropsofliquid: this is the best hll ever ❤️
[1:32:40] eternelvoid: @desemaia no way u say actual physical sports are less extreme
[1:32:45] Yamatron: @cubdave not really dude they are on there own with the coaching staff
[1:32:53] worvansuns: all sports are rough on kids thrust into money for sure, but eSports is a super different environment
[1:32:53] ArkSoftware: yea and kids lack basic survival skills as a result of that imo
[1:33:06] worvansuns: probably more like chess players maybe?
[1:33:14] Smokedoutsisu: “get more therapists”. LOL
[1:33:15] Nitole: I really appreciate this respect for mental health and bringing awareness to complex trauma and how common it is
[1:33:15] Polowy: @Yamatron Theyre not tho..... lmao as someone from canada whos had friends play hockey up to the AHL, youre simply wrong
[1:33:16] curryleague: coaching staff also has a lot of the same issues in terms of upbringing
[1:33:16] karlheinzstockfootage: faker is the  tom brady at 26
[1:33:29] cubdave: @cubdave we talking canadian juniors with host families?  there isn't any of that in LoL.
[1:33:38] Yamatron: @Polowy same here bro in junior hockey there is no support alone in billets at 15-16
[1:33:44] leamfor: @Revenge :(
[1:33:49] iamelvis4: Can we just blame EG?
[1:33:49] Yamatron: @Polowy your tweaking
[1:33:53] kud0slol: new diet - become a pro player
[1:33:54] Hack377: True, football has been around for decades and they are still learning how detrimental it is to the body and brain. E-sports have been around for a fraction of the time
[1:33:54] j_tripper: I left home at 17 to play higher level hockey and there was not support staff the way you are describing

[1:39:29] ArkSoftware: Gamers don't eat eggrolls   I think
[1:39:30] shawnshaunsean: pagota
[1:39:40] director_donut: I bought egg rolls bc of the sponsorship so it worked
[1:39:41] yanya7701: its not dying bc league is still a too big of an esports in the world to actually "die" in any region
[1:39:43] xhappyfaces: I will not eat any other eggroll now that Pagoda are lcs sponsors
[1:39:44] c9_bobby: they need to sponsor POGGODA plays
[1:39:46] leamfor: Hey, I might actually buy something from Pagoda now, so it's working :)

[1:40:44] the1andonlycorbin: Agree with the caller, the LCS is on the come up, the product has been very good
[1:40:48] Hutigwul: someones gotta ask about Danny comon now
[1:40:54] vishnu597: when do we get the "back to mcdonalds" fails of the week sponsored segment
[1:40:56] Lyghtsaber: so true cubby
[1:41:04] yanya7701: by "positive energy" you mean better PR bc Mark is a content creator and thats just in his nature
[1:41:11] oldgegamer: LCS is the most exciting league atm.
[1:41:15] Tzames: trueee
[1:41:18] Pita26: could we all agree to get more people to watch for @leagueofemily cause she deserves the views?
[1:41:20] Lyghtsaber: EU more like PU they stink
[1:41:24] leagueofemily: ngl this is the first time since i joined the broadcast in 2021 that we have had positive sentiment haha
[1:41:30] Fudgenator: LCS and NACL are bangin this year
[1:41:34] Fudgenator: NA > EU
[1:41:38] j_tripper: g2 looks very good, single team region as usual
[1:41:42] ArkSoftware: game betters are def in shambles lol
[1:41:44] Bearus_Aurelius: the LCS is very competitive now. Still not on the same level as the eastern teams, but it certainly seems like the gap is smaller now
[1:41:45] the1andonlycorbin: this past weekend had some banger games
[1:41:48] a_large_farvaaaa: @razlol who do you miss working with most that’s no longer on broadcast
[1:41:48] c9_bobby: nisqy TPing 1 inch away is peak EU
[1:42:01] ProteusWest: I think the sentiment was positive last year too except for the whole player walkout and the time change thing
[1:42:08] SarahDeeGee: Biggest positive about viewership is the average has only dropped from 116k after week 1 to 113k through week 4. There's normally a massive dropoff from opening week into the middle of the season.
[1:42:08] yanya7701: @bearus_aurelius its not
[1:42:22] ellipticalmalcontent: pros is so good!
[1:42:25] ProteusWest: the broadcast made great changes
[1:42:26] OldManMovingSlow: love PROS
[1:42:27] leagueofemily: +1 to everything Raz is saying
[1:42:32] bustlinfungus: i saw dhokla with like 4k viewers and was so confused lol
[1:42:32] Fudgenator: @yanya7701 @yanya7701 why are you here? LUL
[1:42:37] the1andonlycorbin: a lot of more interesting comps this weekend was fun to watch
[1:42:44] eliaswrites: I also think it's a more digestible amount of content between games and auxiliary content
[1:42:47] zerovisible: ya those small changes have been noticed and are really welcome like raiding the pros
[1:42:57] ArkSoftware: next year Jensen better stream 3 times
[1:43:01] PapaSmithy: more Jensen streams coming!
[1:43:02] ellipticalmalcontent: champions queue is so good for streams, i wish people played and streamed it more
[1:43:04] leamfor: JENSEN STREAM PogChamp
[1:43:04] Nitole: yes! That video with the rookies at the start of the year made me an exyu fan and I had never heard of him before that
[1:43:05] ellipticalmalcontent: its my favorite content
[1:43:08] oldgegamer: plus these podcasts! Huge part of the weekly LCS content cycle
[1:43:11] Lyghtsaber: @PapaSmithy 👀
[1:43:13] Bearus_Aurelius: @bearus_aurelius LCs teams in general are better season season compared to last season, imo
[1:43:13] Tameablebread93: been some great discussion tonight
[1:43:23] Fudgenator: @Cubbyxx the NACL viewership looks really strong this year, what are the numbers lookin like
[1:43:30] BalloonHorses: speaking of streams, my favorite stream was when i convinced vulcan to play taric in solo queue. If only he'd pull it out on stage
[1:43:31] cristobvl58: There are Less bad games
[1:43:31] Bearus_Aurelius: meant to say this season ***
[1:43:32] c9_bobby: we don't talk about that game
[1:43:34] Cubbyxx: idk I don't get access to those
[1:43:35] vishnu597: 2 week break is a huge hype killer tho
[1:43:40] ellipticalmalcontent: ellipticalmalcontent subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:43:41] zerovisible: it's incredibly sad that it seems like this is the best LCS product weve had in awhile but viewage is still low
[1:43:47] Cubbyxx: Looks better because it's 1 stream instead of 2 and time slot
[1:43:50] j_tripper: that was a classic NA fiesta
[1:43:50] Fudgenator: @Cubbyxx PepeHands
[1:43:53] the1andonlycorbin: that game was fantastic, even tho my team lost Sadge
[1:44:08] curryleague: It's great to see rookies actually thriving in the LCS
[1:44:10] karlheinzstockfootage: btw can i hear less about insanity being a mad professor when he is doinb '19
[1:44:17] yanya7701: @Fudgenator asking ppl why they are here in a twitch chat is pretty stupid. There are infinite reasons why
[1:44:18] Nightbot: Like the stream? Follow Travis' other socials! Youtube: bit.ly/2ORk0Da | Instagram: instagram.com/travisgafford_ | Twitter: twitter.com/travisgafford | Linktree: https://linktr.ee/tgisupport

[1:46:31] karlheinzstockfootage: will lcs reach summer split?
[1:46:32] razlol: you should never be able to install programs at work
[1:46:41] teetii_: @Pita26 its ok because im in networking so i bypass it hahaha
[1:46:44] yanya7701: @Fudgenator you have no idea what this shows intended audience is bc you are not Travis and have no idea whats good for him and his business, especially when the viewership is like couple hundred
[1:46:45] teetii_: @Lyghtsaber yes lmao
[1:46:47] vishnu597: but what about uninstalling programs at work
[1:46:49] app1ethief: sotlScam sotlScam sotlScam
[1:46:49] Bearus_Aurelius: I got the Bo3 call if y'all want it!

[1:47:09] travisgafford: @yanya7701 we're over 1k right now fwiw
[1:47:21] vishnu597: @MrBigNonsense worth
[1:47:30] ellipticalmalcontent: i think relegation would be so hype

[1:47:44] trespasur: yall remember that dumbass dome
[1:47:45] Pita26: @dalimccubist maximum content?
[1:47:46] yanya7701: @travisgafford I was talking about Twitch bc I dont watch YT
[1:47:56] ProteusWest: if only they could bring in two teams from somewhere, maybe have them compete for temporary spots
[1:48:11] Bearus_Aurelius: I watch on YouTube and chat on both quinnadKEKW
[1:48:16] leagueofemily: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
[1:48:19] karlheinzstockfootage: lpl adds like a team every split
[1:48:21] JayBee_: eavSpin
[1:48:35] ZePaladin_: The two spots are just gonna stagnate
[1:48:38] Fudgenator: @yanya7701 Man please watch and sub and dono to travis, i was not talking about viewership LUL
[1:48:48] ZePaladin_: Keep it smaller, keep it competitive
[1:49:00] JayBee_: scam train eavMonka
[1:49:06] Sidnor: only way weekday games could bring more viewership is if 2 games are on around 8-9 pm
[1:49:09] BalloonHorses: one thing that i will say about weekday games is, at least from home, it gave me something to look forward to after work
[1:49:12] JayBee_: JayBee_ is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to travisgafford's community! They've gifted a total of 16 in the channel! 
[1:49:12] JayBee_: JayBee_ gifted a Tier 1 sub to huyubhi!

[1:49:16] nocturnavi: it was the timing that was so bad
[1:49:25] dropsofliquid: they were better for me
[1:49:26] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[1:49:30] Bearus_Aurelius: Jackie was on here for like an hour+ a few years back I think right?
[1:49:31] dropsofliquid: but I know I’m not the norm there
[1:49:36] oldgegamer: assuming the audience is NA based….
[1:49:45] PapaSmithy: the LCS was always 40-60% EU viewers and there's more viewers east coast than west coast
[1:49:46] desemaia: desemaia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[1:49:47] rvollert: Personally, I'd watch more on a weekday night versus a weekend at noon
[1:49:48] MattScoot2: @travisgafford give me 2 remote bo1 monday-friday and give me bo3 on the weekends
[1:49:49] PapaSmithy: so its a bit rip logic imo
[1:49:49] BalloonHorses: if the first game was at like  3 or 4 PM pacific, I think weekdays wouldve been fine
[1:49:58] yanya7701: @Fudgenator it does not matter, by your logic any non NA viewers cannot be here and thats just stupid from Travis' perspective
[1:49:58] Ikancast: late enough in the day for California is so late here on the east coast
[1:50:04] karlheinzstockfootage: bless travis, he has done well when vc's got free money.
[1:50:10] leamfor: Too much of the audience is international
[1:50:25] Fudgenator: @yanya7701 You're good dawg, not worth it LUL
[1:50:33] karlheinzstockfootage: oops gave free money
[1:50:55] BalloonHorses: but yeah with my 9-5 eastern job, i did used to enjoy the weekdays, selfishly lol
[1:51:02] Ikancast: even LEC i feel starts so late. begins at 11am here on the east coast. half my day is almost over before EU even starts, let alone NA
[1:51:04] Bearus_Aurelius: damnit Jim, I'm a doctor not an Analyst!
[1:51:06] pausechamp52: raz your hands are stuck
[1:51:10] ProteusWest: Friday Night and Monday Night was always hard because it was 3 days instead of 2
[1:51:22] leagueofemily: lmao
[1:51:31] ProteusWest: for some reason, extending LCS out past 2 days has always been problematic
[1:51:35] thoughtfulcoconut: it used to be at like 6CT or something
[1:51:35] oldgegamer: either way… weekends still better. especially NA west coast. can wake up and watch LEC through to LCS Until like 3 PM if I wanted to
[1:51:45] karlheinzstockfootage: lec and lcs are gonna be gone in two years.  league is about lpl and lck
[1:51:50] ellipticalmalcontent: rebuilding a product takes time though
[1:52:00] VoicesCarry7: i got us a new viewer guys no worries. my non league watching friend loved the 100t v c9 match
[1:52:00] dropsofliquid: I got out of the habit tbh & keep forgetting Saturdays
[1:52:08] MattScoot2: F raz
[1:52:08] saltedapplesiv: raz?
[1:52:12] JayBee_: monkaW
[1:52:13] Pita26: Raz tilted so hard he's frozen
[1:52:14] RudeDinosaur: raz is a sliideshow
[1:52:15] Bearus_Aurelius: Isn't it fair to say though that a lot of people were lost last year that have not come back?
[1:52:15] c9_bobby: razbot
[1:52:16] JayBee_: monkaS
[1:52:17] leagueofemily: f

[1:52:31] ZePaladin_: Trying to silence Raz lol
[1:52:32] oldgegamer: Raz is phasing out
[1:52:32] thoughtfulcoconut: i'm not understanding why people think viewership will ever go back UP. you can't get people who left to come back and stay back. it's the natural progression of things
[1:52:33] desemaia: SSSsss
[1:52:35] aimeleone: i agree Raz
[1:52:38] poisonyvie: MrDestructoid
[1:52:38] ellipticalmalcontent: we might not see the impact of the weekend change until a year or two out

[1:52:39] 5deadwhiteguys: razbot getting ddos'd by riot
[1:52:39] Pita26: Somebody gotta go check in on Raz
[1:52:42] Prophet181: Raz ascended to a new dimension on this rant
[1:52:44] Pita26: Riot after him
[1:52:44] JayBee_: Travis trying to silence Raz again ratirlSad
[1:52:46] SandyToez_: MrDestructoid
[1:52:47] rvollert: Viewers were obviously lost by being kicked to the curb by riot
[1:52:48] leagueofemily: anyway I think the big thing for weekends imo is that the ROI on people BEING IN STUDIO and their experience is awesome
[1:52:48] Gambirino_: That freeze frame is good
[1:52:48] VoicesCarry7: hes been a robot this whole time
[1:52:50] Konnoke: raz scared us
[1:52:54] Bearus_Aurelius: Raz is right. People left last year and did not come back
[1:52:56] P4llace: RAZ LMFAO
[1:52:56] the1andonlycorbin: MechaRobot MechaRobot MechaRobot
[1:52:57] Polowy: youre good raz
[1:52:59] IAmMurdr: oh my god that freeze frame is so good

[1:53:01] app1ethief: CUBBY WAS SO STILL I THOUGHT HIS CONNECTION DIED TOO
[1:53:01] iamelvis4: Riot Censoring

[1:53:17] RudeDinosaur: MrDestructoid Markz killin his bandwidth
[1:53:18] ArkSoftware: does bro have the mario virus?
[1:53:18] worvansuns: sotlPop
[1:53:19] JayBee_: "Mom! Stop playing candy crush! Im gaming!"
[1:53:20] GreenCervidae: league as a game is just disappearing in NA relative to other major regions, riot has more responsibility to make the game more popular in NA than the LCS has responsibility to increase viewership
[1:53:25] DrNollie: This freeze frame of Raz is cursed
[1:53:29] karlheinzstockfootage: golden guardians raz
[1:53:32] leagueofemily: and how that can affect someone's opinions towards the LCS as a whole
[1:53:34] Ikancast: i agree with the live audience aspect. seeing people at the games having fun translates to people watching at home

[1:55:42] Pita26: @ProteusWest infrastructure has to exist for you to hate on it
[1:55:45] JayBee_: JayBee_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! sotlAlien
[1:55:46] iamelvis4: How do you reach those people you lost though
[1:55:48] thoughtfulcoconut: you also cant just "generate" new viewers. in NA, if your product is not culturally or socially relevant, it won't stick long
[1:55:50] Cyanteal: Mark hired Jensen for one last job
[1:55:56] razlol: @ProteusWest US*
[1:56:01] ayamzk: JEEEENSEEEEN
[1:56:10] karlheinzstockfootage: mark is a patsy set up by tencent and riot
[1:56:38] c9_bobby: the weekend is much better for the in person experience who's energy comes through on broadcast
[1:56:42] JinnAxel: Sometimes I do feel that Riot set up Mark for failure, despite everything he's trying to do
[1:56:46] c9_bobby: if you see empty seats it's sadge
[1:56:52] nocturnavi: the LCS has more fundamental issues related to esports stability and the game's lack of popularity in NA
[1:56:57] Tameablebread93: yes but it’s still good to have somebody who is forward thinking at the wheel during those times
[1:57:05] ellipticalmalcontent: hot take, the finals location does not matter to most fans
[1:57:07] Npulze: wat riot is a cult?
[1:57:31] Mounizle: I wish they could have at least done the hollywood bowl or some local theater for finals
[1:57:32] JayBee_: @c9_bobby yeah its cool seeing the fans energized for sure on broadcast, it comes through
[1:57:41] imhei: without some kind of massive change, patch, or version of the game, there is nothing bringing back a big enough chunk of people to ever "grow" viewership
[1:57:48] Ikancast: and we still havent gotten to the saudi world cup yet
[1:57:50] yanya7701: whose foundation is crumbling?
[1:58:26] leagueofemily: i think a lot of the problems we have now are related to things from years ago sadly
[1:58:29] Bearus_Aurelius: everyday that goes by just proves MonteCristo and Thorin more right
[1:58:30] BeepImaJeep2015: Dr Travis?
[1:58:31] karlheinzstockfootage: @imhei shit the na wins worlds patch needs to be implemented.  it ain't happening
[1:58:37] Prophet181: Travis studying to become a neuro scientist
[1:58:41] Lyghtsaber: BASED and TRUE
[1:58:48] oldgegamer: big true
[1:58:55] ProteusWest: I remember promo/relegation, it was awful
[1:58:56] Polowy: Franchising will allow teams to develop players" LUL LUL
[1:59:09] GreenCervidae: riot needs to make league more popular in na if the lcs will ever hope to match viewership in other major regions
[1:59:13] am_kevin: that was still better than having 3 teams not trying for 5 years straight
[1:59:19] thoughtfulcoconut: But teams legit just stopped giving a shit with franchising. We had at least 2 teams a year just perma coasting at the bottom with no continuity on any roster
[1:59:25] RudeDinosaur: 3
[1:59:27] Nitole: @leagueofemily Can you give some examples?
[1:59:28] Cyanteal: 🪃
[1:59:35] JinnAxel: @bearus_aurelius I don't think it's a riot thing, as much as an industry wide thing. Monte/thorin and co all have way less impressions than they did in the hey day
[1:59:35] karlheinzstockfootage: @bearus_aurelius no, every day that passes makes thorinn and monte look stupid for grog coin
[1:59:36] RudeDinosaur: TSM too
[1:59:37] tadeudca: Orgs laziness and only thinking about $$
[1:59:47] magregs: and we are stuck with dog orgs
[1:59:57] Lyghtsaber: teams having the chance to come up from challengers was peak league. i was a cloud9 fan from their quantic time
[2:00:06] ProteusWest: I say that as a C9 fan, too, which never really was threatened by relegation, but franchising itself isn't an issue so much as how the LCS owners and orgs dealt with it
[2:00:16] yanya7701: I dont think you are getting any different results even with relegation. The NA player base and infrastructure was bound to fail
[2:00:31] ProteusWest: LPL franchised before the LCS, and they did well with that
[2:00:33] tadeudca: This is why I look into lpl and lck people want $$ but they want even more to improve the scene
[2:00:59] kud0slol: Good guy steve usually signs his former players as content creators
[2:01:01] hobnobbin: Open the league up, pay out the teams that franchised.  More NA talent, re-introduce relegation.
[2:01:02] Ikancast: yes
[2:01:05] yanya7701: yeah 8 teams is so weird
[2:01:06] nerfcapitalism: facrs
[2:01:07] tadeudca: Improve the scene in long term bring more money
[2:01:07] nerfcapitalism: facts
[2:01:23] Polowy: MrBeast save us
[2:01:28] leagueofemily: @Nitole it's long and nuanced. i talked about a few of them in making the rounds with kelsey last week. i wouldn't want to type them out because too long and i'd want to add context
[2:01:34] hobnobbin: CLG rebirth, call Hotshot, lets frigging go
[2:01:36] ProteusWest: Valorant style promotion would actually be interesting to me
[2:01:37] j_tripper: how can we say that when this year has the most parity we’ve seen in a long time
[2:01:37] c9_bobby: or make the last 2 spots rotating each year for top NACL spots
[2:01:39] oldgegamer: Are 3rd party TOs allowed to run collegiate?
[2:01:40] karlheinzstockfootage: 8 teams  means best of 3s
[2:01:41] glassjaws: what happened to the slots of the teams that left?  Weren't those worth millions at one point?
[2:01:43] yanya7701: you are never getting a good tier 2 system Travis bc NA player base is just not there
[2:01:54] Ikancast: disguised already ditched valorant to go to southeast asia because its cheaper
[2:02:02] karlheinzstockfootage: but travis hates best of 3s so much
[2:02:03] numiiigoesrawrz: FLYC has potential lcs players that were rumored going on orgs
[2:02:14] MedicCasts: Under two hours? But I just woke up. :(
[2:02:16] Nitole: @leagueofemily ok, thanks for responding! ily on the broadcast ❤️
[2:02:23] numiiigoesrawrz: omg hi medic 💚
[2:02:25] Bearus_Aurelius: Hotline League needs a SuperShow every once in a while right?
[2:02:36] bassnasty: oof that is a brutal question
[2:02:46] thoughtfulcoconut: I say no
[2:02:48] karlheinzstockfootage: go to korean server
[2:02:57] karlheinzstockfootage: if good get a job
[2:02:58] Ikancast: try to get a spot in LEC and get those German labor laws
[2:03:31] oldgegamer: this is the same in most competitive games
[2:03:39] thoughtfulcoconut: At this point, you're looking at a middling salary for maybe 2 or 3 years MAX and you're passing up the opportunity to go get a degree and develop useful skills for an actual profession
[2:03:39] oldgegamer: it’s always a huge gamble
[2:03:51] eliaswrites: @Revenge do you regret not going for it the first time around?
[2:03:55] karlheinzstockfootage: sniper kinda did the opposite

[2:06:01] dropsofliquid: that’s rough
[2:06:33] j_tripper: I solely lived on loans while in school, so not that bad
[2:06:56] rheysweg: As someone who played amateur in another sport during college I 100% agree with @revenge I was super close to breaking through into pro and didn't quite make it but it was an amazing experience while I was still developing as a person in many ways outside financials
[2:06:58] linkedin_rat: open the can
[2:06:59] yanya7701: are they providing food and housing? If so thats not so bad
[2:07:27] eviltrenton: you lose 1 million on average by not getting a college degree in the US
[2:07:34] eviltrenton: *lifetime earnings
[2:07:40] Voidzcore: does the players association keep a record of each players salary? if not they should
[2:07:57] Bearus_Aurelius: Shopify is better than C9/NRG imo
[2:08:02] karlheinzstockfootage: getting a degree sets one up for a job for the rest of one's life.  playing league means you peaked at 20
[2:08:09] desemaia: @bearus_aurelius hell no
[2:08:21] BeepImaJeep2015: Is he just describing the fact that to succeed in any career you need to make people like you?
[2:08:26] desemaia: @desemaia SR is a poverty franchise already
[2:08:32] julesSuperHD: @dalimccubist why not get a degree after playing? Some folks play, earn some money, and then do school anyway
[2:08:36] Tzames: @dalimccubist playing video games at 20 is just what every nerd college kid does
[2:08:40] hobnobbin: @Revenge You're gonna love corporate America
[2:08:47] Bearus_Aurelius: sorry, I meant the players are better atm, not the org is better
[2:09:03] KSnOwnage: Oooo
[2:09:09] Archique: So nobody wanted Licorice
[2:09:10] Tzames: @julesSuperHD because adulthood comes very vast and you'd have to have some sort of financial backing or have had to have made enough money to support yourself
[2:09:15] Ikancast: interesting
[2:09:18] 23vulture: @dalimccubist That's what Looper did
[2:09:24] Todo88: Todo88 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 👀

[2:09:40] j_tripper: that’s life, networking is your best advantage. it’s less about merit than who you know, not unique to esports
[2:09:51] Fudgenator: No way
[2:09:52] Tzames: LMAO WHAT A BAD TAKE 100k ARE YOU SERIOUS
[2:09:57] magregs: XD
[2:10:02] karlheinzstockfootage: @julesSuperHD not wrong.  you think jojo will ever go to school?
[2:10:02] kud0slol: 100k isnt that bad even in la brurh
[2:10:05] Pita26: @j_tripper true in literally every space
[2:10:09] Darkallyht: after taxes that is 70k
[2:10:11] dropsofliquid: @tzames with living & food nah
[2:10:15] yuvikko: lmfao idk 100k is not bad
[2:10:18] BeepImaJeep2015: Revenge is more out of touch than most of Travis's guests
[2:10:21] melancholywriter: i mean, 100k  is like engineer salary
[2:10:23] fr0sttea: I can understand in general what Revenge is saying... but 100K in LA is still pretty good
[2:10:24] PapaSmithy: @Tzames minimum wage is ~67k in la and thats not enough to survive rly
[2:10:24] Darkallyht: after rent and food that is like 25k
[2:10:25] exodia0077: chat has never lived in california
[2:10:27] Bearus_Aurelius: the taxes in LA are insane. the middle class has been destroyed.
[2:10:29] Tzames: @dropsofliquid you're on drugs if you think 100k anywhere in america is bad
[2:10:29] yanya7701: wait so the base salary is 100k?
[2:10:39] ellipticalmalcontent: @melancholywriter not in LA, not even close
[2:10:41] numiiigoesrawrz: in LA..... it's not good
[2:10:43] ADrugge: And Cali taxes
[2:10:44] hobnobbin: @kud0slol 100k in Cali?
[2:10:45] Ikancast: yeah its not enough
[2:10:46] 5deadwhiteguys: when you consider most players are working like 70-80hrs a week is just HORRIBLE value
[2:10:52] rvollert: $100K is above the HHI in LA lol
[2:10:53] Mounizle: theyd essentially be living off of cup of ramen or hummus and pita
[2:10:54] draco2134435: What the fuck are you guys on pro players don't just work 40hrs a week lmao
[2:10:58] matriculate_matt: factz
[2:10:59] CouchyHOTS: @Tzames did u used to play hots
[2:10:59] yanya7701: are they providing housing?
[2:11:00] box01237: I think 100k is enough lol.
[2:11:03] melancholywriter: Ok true
[2:11:07] Bry_bry9397: 70k for a 60 hr a week job is like 25 an hour LOL
[2:11:07] nocturnavi: for a job that's 12 hrs a day 6 days a week that's not a lot, especially with no future prospects after playing
[2:11:10] Tzames: maybe
[2:11:18] Hack377: Good point
[2:11:18] karlheinzstockfootage: vulcan passed his peak earning years at 22
[2:11:22] ArkSoftware: it's a solid take. Revenge is right
[2:11:30] Todo88: They're working way more than 60 hours a week lol
[2:11:33] saltedapplesiv: so it should be in chiccago
[2:11:33] kud0slol: @hobnobbin yes
[2:11:34] numiiigoesrawrz: revenge is saying in LOS ANGELES working 12+ hours a day and not being provided stuff like food, is what he's saying
[2:11:40] numiiigoesrawrz: it's time vs money a bit
[2:11:40] oldgegamer: facts. you need the reward to offset the risks
[2:11:43] chasingsummer: revenge is 100% right
[2:11:47] hobnobbin: @saltedapplesiv yes
[2:11:48] KSnOwnage: @Bry_bry9397 You have nothing after. The hospital isn't going to care about his esports career in his resume.
[2:11:50] yanya7701: ok without housing thats pretty bad
[2:11:51] Ikancast: i wonder if riot could sponsor housing or something to help the players
[2:11:52] BeepImaJeep2015: It's about upside. At one point you'd get more than $1 million if you were among the best in the league. There aren't too many professions that can say that.
[2:11:55] Bearus_Aurelius: this is why people suggest moving the league to a better state. Hell Nevada would be perfect.
[2:11:55] numiiigoesrawrz: guys housing here is TERRIBLE
[2:11:59] app1ethief: he's lived it i think he'd know best here
[2:12:04] GreenCervidae: move the fkin lcs out of la already man fk this place
[2:12:06] karlheinzstockfootage: culver city
[2:12:16] desemaia: Revenge is right this isn't a long term career path. you can be in an out
[2:12:25] fr0sttea: The point about needing to save money for after LCS is a valid argument, for sure
[2:12:32] numiiigoesrawrz: I agree
[2:12:37] Bry_bry9397: @KSnOwnage yes exactly, not developing skills/knowledge that can be used in other industry either.
[2:12:38] Hack377: Would they ever consider moving LCS from LA?
[2:12:42] numiiigoesrawrz: 2.3-3k for one bedroom
[2:12:42] Lyghtsaber: -36k
[2:12:47] Ikancast: thats insane. nearly 3x the price where i am
[2:12:47] Darkallyht: 100k-36k with out utlites
[2:12:47] c9_bobby: and ordering $60/day for food delivery x 365 days
[2:12:48] CouchyHOTS: the thing is by taking the 100k you're also sacrificing future earnings by not enrolling in school or seeking training that leads to a career. LCS players gotta make retirement money fast or theyre screwed
[2:12:49] j_tripper: based actually. my girl has a high salary but works 70+ hours per week in an expensive city, she is questioning if it’s worth it (and it’s probably not)
[2:12:53] dropsofliquid: you don’t even have time
[2:12:54] BeepImaJeep2015: I "have" to doordash LUL
[2:12:56] julesSuperHD: You don't need to rent a 3k/month apartment. Share a house with folks
[2:12:57] kud0slol: ok i was followign you but you definitely dont have to door dash
[2:12:58] Polowy: You dont have to door dash...
[2:12:59] nerfcapitalism: get a roomate :)
[2:12:59] hobnobbin: you guys need to get out of that shithole state
[2:13:01] saltedapplesiv: you can't stop grinding as a pro
[2:13:02] c9_bobby: almost $22,000 in food
[2:13:06] aZooRee: not to mention public transportation doesn’t exist here so you either need a car or pay for ubers
[2:13:10] RainYoRHa: Meanwhile NRG got a private chef lol
[2:13:11] Swaggifornia: i think ppl dont understand that lcs isnt a normal 9-5
[2:13:12] KSnOwnage: @Bry_bry9397 Yup. Some people only think about the present.
[2:13:12] chris_tr: why cant he cook ?
[2:13:17] daisydupe23: do gamers not know how to cook lol
[2:13:18] matthew0zz: the point is also what is longevity of pro career also @travisgafford
[2:13:21] tadeudca: This is kids mentality, when you think as an a responsible adult 100k when you have to pay for everything and you don't have a fallback when you're out.
[2:13:24] BalloonHorses: ok i mean doordash, buy freezer meals and microwave
[2:13:25] ixbx: if you make 100K in CA, you pay about 29K in taxes. 3K per month 36K so rent and taxes you got 35K to spend
[2:13:29] numiiigoesrawrz: guys revenge is saying WHILE WORKING AS A PRO PLAYER practicing ITS 13+ HOURS. this is what he's saying. it's time vs money
[2:13:29] dropsofliquid: his 12+ hour work day makes cooking impossible
[2:13:31] karlheinzstockfootage: 1.5k rent for me.  but i have a job not playing video games
[2:13:47] BeepImaJeep2015: You can make a pretty good meal during the wait time for solo queue.
[2:13:49] yanya7701: why do NA orgs not provide housing? I think every other region does
[2:13:52] CrimmMD: @dalimccubist you probably don't live in santa monica
[2:13:52] melancholywriter: so basically your like making 100k for 80hours of work a week
[2:14:01] MeHaveDadBod: meal prep
[2:14:02] desemaia: @tadeudca these are kids we are talking about. what are u on about
[2:14:04] OneBetterThanYou: oone hundo agree
[2:14:05] c9_bobby: just cook during draft KEK
[2:14:06] box01237: yeah, makes sense
[2:14:09] zerovisible: damn that got real
[2:14:09] Tzames: i just dont buy it, there are 16 waking hours in the day, you can find time to cook
[2:14:11] Thiccnuggie: chat no one wants to become a professional video game pro so they can begin their meal-planning journey
[2:14:11] thoughtfulcoconut: that's cap. you  have time for whatever you want to have time for
[2:14:11] rvollert: Just this highlights how the economics don't make sense
[2:14:12] Todo88: SeemsGood
[2:14:13] leagueofemily: go mo go
[2:14:14] Milpoool: I mean I work 12 hours days and still go shopping and prepare food
[2:14:15] Bearus_Aurelius: people hear this and then say Pro's don't work hard enough boesKEK
[2:14:17] Darkallyht: this chat is dumb as fuck tbh
[2:14:25] Darkallyht: they dont undersxtand

[2:14:27] numiiigoesrawrz: this is the manifesto
[2:14:27] julesSuperHD: cook during LCS pauses
[2:14:27] Mortryx: Cook during queues
[2:14:34] curryleague: They just asked revenge whwat he likes to eat
[2:14:43] legendofivan: i
[2:14:43] numiiigoesrawrz: guys I live in LA I'm not a pro player it's BUTT EXPENSIVE
[2:14:45] Thiccnuggie: just put the egg rolls in! kappa
[2:14:45] HENgauw: 🗣🗣🔊🔊 Teams need to STOP being bums! 🗣🗣🔊🔊
[2:14:46] karlheinzstockfootage: @CrimmMD a state away :0
[2:14:47] Vivimatsu: revenge is spitting facts man
[2:14:49] Tzames: i dont back it. doordash is not a "MUST" have
[2:14:50] saltedapplesiv: cooking during queue is a great way to start a fire
[2:14:50] Revenge: @curryleague LOL
[2:14:51] desemaia: it is true tho, plus they get no healthcare or other benefits people who have normal jobs do
[2:14:53] numiiigoesrawrz: yet alone a PRO PLAYER living here
[2:14:53] oldgegamer: the man is 100% correct. there are just delusion people in chat
[2:14:57] Ikancast: yep thats a key issue not just for this year but for the future
[2:15:00] Vivimatsu: hi @numiiigoesrawrz <3
[2:15:04] Archique: Yes, there are no other large cities
[2:15:07] Bearus_Aurelius: Revenge is 100% correct
[2:15:08] tadeudca: @desemaia because kids don't think about this and when you put a more mature perspective you'll see that this is not much and people "dream" about this
[2:15:09] chris_tr: I mean some people work 12 hours day shift and they still have to cook
[2:15:10] ArkSoftware: what is LCS minimum salary? 75k?
[2:15:15] numiiigoesrawrz: hi girly @vivimatsu
[2:15:18] box01237: But if you're a pro player, you only need to commute to the studio 2 days a week, so I don't get why you can't live further away? Or do you have to go to your org's training place?
[2:15:20] bassnasty: @Revenge was awesome seeing your story in the LCS and impressed you loved it enough to take the risk of playing. As someone who is an adult. appreciate the show and lots of props man hope you land well
[2:15:23] bustlinfungus: its worse because theyd have to be playing under those conditions while having to compete with guys who have personal chefs and everything taken care of
[2:15:26] karlheinzstockfootage: travis is gonna shit cause vc money paid his rent
[2:15:29] airman_baker: As an LA attorney who works 12hr days and recently made it to $100-125k range - def not enough time in the day for a ProPlayer to cook for themselves and all the other random shit. 100k is def a budget
[2:15:30] ProteusWest: I wouldn't worry about it, Revenge, I was a teacher and people said I made too much because I have "summers off"
[2:15:30] rvollert: I wouldn't be a pro player for just $100K in LA
[2:15:32] eliaswrites: @box01237 pro players work in offices
[2:15:33] numiiigoesrawrz: @box01237 you're going in the office everyday most likely
[2:15:39] Bearus_Aurelius: 100k in LA is low income
[2:15:42] box01237: Ah, I see.
[2:15:46] numiiigoesrawrz: you have to practice with the team, preferably in person
[2:15:50] 1twenty3: time for Gary, Indiana
[2:15:54] Mr_Ro: pros are lazy because they dont practice Kappa pros are lazy because they cant cook BASED Kappa
[2:15:55] ixbx: if you make 100K, spend 29K on takes, 36K on rent, you got 35K for everything else and future
[2:15:56] Todo88: You're also not learning long-term job skills to imcrease future salary
[2:15:58] fr0sttea: 100k is not... a lot of money in LA, but it's not Low income
[2:16:00] c9_bobby: and the more u make the more taxes so it's diminishing returns
[2:16:01] Archique: Teams offer 401k?
[2:16:04] imhei: imagine paying taxes to the state of california - yikes
[2:16:07] desemaia: u can never save at that point.

[2:16:09] matthew0zz: and its not a lifetime career its a think you do in early 20s @Revenge
[2:16:10] travisgafford: @dalimccubist are you talking about vc paying my rent? I'm confused
[2:16:13] numiiigoesrawrz: @archique depends on org
[2:16:17] julesSuperHD: At 100K in LA you can save maybe 10k in a year. 10k isn't gonna set you up for your life.
[2:16:19] Tzames: @ixbx he spends 25000 on doordash
[2:16:21] yuvikko: I think the biggest factor is that you lose everything after going pro
[2:16:21] karlheinzstockfootage: travis could live well with brandon sanderson
[2:16:22] Bearus_Aurelius: LCS would be so much better in a state with an actual economy
[2:16:25] yanya7701: im pretty sure LPL LCK and LEC all provide housing to their players. And all of them are in expensive cities like Shanghai, Seoul and Berlin
[2:16:27] Voidzcore: You don't get to close your work laptop at 5pm and enjoy your life
[2:16:29] tadeudca: I really appreciate @revenge perspective because people dream about this but the hard truth is... You sacrifice too much.. to a no return
[2:16:40] ch3mis7: The longevity argument I think is quite important. Let's say you get 2 years in pro @100k and come out with no education, no resume, no other marketable skills. You're kinda rucked
[2:16:40] melancholywriter: you just gotta be Faker or ur doomed
[2:16:42] Ikancast: signing a lease and then getting dropped from the team shortly after would be tough
[2:16:43] yuvikko: You make 100k for like 5 years, and then nothing after
[2:16:45] fr0sttea: Like, we can be realistic.   100k Is not enough for an LCS pro in general. It's not enough to save.   But it can't be considered even close to "low income"
[2:16:46] RudeDinosaur: @bearus_aurelius tbh the teams would just use than as an excuse to pay even less
[2:16:49] leagueofemily: i am worried about this for myself ngl
[2:16:50] oldgegamer: Sounds like the LCS should move closer to fans on the east coast… lower cost of operations, lower cost of living, more fans…
[2:16:53] kud0slol: does riot hire a lot of former pros
[2:16:55] Freezman13: grind that leetcode bro
[2:16:56] Swaggifornia: people are more likely to discriminate against weird gamer types, bad social skills
[2:16:56] BalloonHorses: This is all valid, but also save doordash money by buying freezer meals and a microwave
[2:16:59] HENgauw: My medical school has 0 former pros you'd be a shoe-in here
[2:16:59] leagueofemily: even being on broadcast
[2:17:04] Cubbyxx: Agree @leagueofemily
[2:17:08] numiiigoesrawrz: Emily :c
[2:17:09] legendofivan: u can become an lcs analyst teehee
[2:17:19] bustlinfungus: @freezman13 even here i cant escape leetcode
[2:17:20] Cubbyxx: It's hard to transition out
[2:17:22] scrapabidoopimpaff: Why is lcs even in LA to begin with ??
[2:17:23] chasingsummer: there's a big difference between making 80k a year as an associate in an office spending 70% of your time doing fuck all on reddit and making 100k as a pro player having to spend most of your time on the job 100% focused
[2:17:24] BeepImaJeep2015: This is true and any and every job.
[2:17:29] Pita26: @leagueofemily wouldn't those skills be a bit more transferable?
[2:17:34] Tzames: @scrapabidoopimpaff riot office
[2:17:34] Bearus_Aurelius: @scrapabidoopimpaff Riot HQ is there
[2:17:42] scrapabidoopimpaff: a
[2:17:47] Lyghtsaber: broadcast peeps could easily go be in marketing with the amount of content they make up
[2:17:50] Cossacco: This is a very important topic
[2:17:51] ProteusWest: chat: if what you make covers only your expenses, then you are low income...some places are more expensive than others
[2:17:52] thoughtfulcoconut: thats why anyone trying to go pro now should seriously reconsider it. if you're already not a good applicant for colleges/universitites, spending 2/3 years in league is not going to do you any favors
[2:17:55] leagueofemily: @Pita26 a bit but journalism is borked as a whole
[2:18:05] curryleague: If people really knew the decision making behind some LCS teams they would be mindblown
[2:18:05] leagueofemily: i used to be a sportswriter
[2:18:07] tadeudca: Guys.. this happens in soccer in football but in eSports os even more brutal
[2:18:08] BalloonHorses: @leagueofemily I think the skills are transferable! I mean, any broadcasting job, you have a demo reel. Have faith in yourself!
[2:18:10] desemaia: @leagueofemily yeah journalists getting paid peanuts rn
[2:18:12] Voidzcore: this has been one of the most interesting HLL in a while tbh
[2:18:13] leagueofemily: and have a degree
[2:18:14] curryleague: So many young NA players let down
[2:18:17] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford umm advertisers tossed money back when o percent loANS WAS A THING
[2:18:20] c9_bobby: but y'all in like 20 years we are gonna have some STORIES to tell
[2:18:20] yuvikko: Do you guys think it’s different in China and Korea?
[2:18:21] Bearus_Aurelius: Teams could pay players a lot less in other states and the players would still be far better off
[2:18:23] leagueofemily: and i'm still fucking terrified lmao
[2:18:25] Pita26: @leagueofemily I didn't realize that about journalism
[2:18:29] Ikancast: great insights in that response
[2:18:31] desemaia: Revenge has been best guest in a while
[2:18:33] travisgafford: @dalimccubist but that's not vc
[2:18:43] ArkSoftware: this episode was a banger for sure
[2:18:51] robert2209: this might feel like a "womens division" in a regular sports.Could the problem come from "we don't have much sponsors"?
[2:18:56] julesSuperHD: Revenge pouring his heart out regarding the state of pay and players careers but its 9pm so the show has to end
[2:18:56] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford WHO PAID FOR THE TEAMS
[2:18:57] Todo88: @ArkSoftware 💯
[2:18:58] numiiigoesrawrz: THANK YOU SANDY
[2:19:00] BeepImaJeep2015: LUL
[2:19:04] ProteusWest: @yuvikko they pay their players worse but they have way more players to just take their spots if they don't want it
[2:19:05] travisgafford: @dalimccubist the teams didn't pay my rent??
[2:19:06] j_tripper: vote for revenge mvp guest
[2:19:09] oldgegamer: yo best show this year. right up there with Yeon telling fans to go f themselves
[2:19:10] Bearus_Aurelius: it's not delusional to move it man.
[2:19:11] PapaSmithy: Flight Check Crew SeemsGood
[2:19:13] SevTST: Cuz Chicago is gonna be that much cheaper...
[2:19:14] razlol: did we just call sponsor money vc money
[2:19:15] karlheinzstockfootage: mb caps
[2:19:19] Bearus_Aurelius: it's delusional to keep doing the same thing and failing
[2:19:20] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:19:27] yanya7701: the problem is not with Riot is with the orgs. Its not Riot's job to provide housing to all the players
[2:19:27] leagueofemily: gogogogo
[2:19:32] Ersean: I wish my boss payed for my rent.
[2:19:32] Pita26: @bearus_aurelius the cost of moving it is delusional. Not free to move.
[2:19:37] Nitole: flight check is amazing 💚
[2:19:39] magiceye7278: He's right. It's a lot like a performing artist career. No matter how well you do, or what following you have, it is in the hands of a select few people who choose to hire you. Look at Jizuke: wins first team mid in LCS and hasn't had a 1st team contract since. Just like Licorice. I hate to see it
[2:19:39] 5deadwhiteguys: GET READY FOR THE ROADSHOW CONVO
[2:19:39] Thiccnuggie: I loved the take
[2:19:41] AyyeKaleb: Imagine if Bwipo was on the show lol
[2:19:43] leagueofemily: don't apologize @Revenge
[2:19:44] MedicCasts: We all feel bad that Raz is here
[2:19:47] MedicCasts: but that's all good
[2:19:52] IAmMurdr: yessssssss
[2:19:52] Tzames: delusional to continually lose money in LA vs weighing better business decisions in a different location
[2:19:52] PapaSmithy: @MedicCasts Pog
[2:19:55] AyyeKaleb: LOL Medi
[2:19:56] Thiccnuggie: POG
[2:19:57] MedicCasts: @PapaSmithy Pog
[2:19:58] megablue_: im ok too 👍
[2:20:00] Prophet181: @MedicCasts True

[2:20:05] Todo88: xdd
[2:20:08] zerovisible: bro we don’t know when we will hear from him again LET REVENGE YAP
[2:20:08] RudeDinosaur: People need to realize that if the LCS moved to a cheaper state the teams would just use that as an excuse to pay even less
[2:20:08] esportsjatt: Yo Edmonton is cold AF
[2:20:09] Tameablebread93: make it a long episode
[2:20:10] PapaSmithy: @MedicCasts basiilHEART
[2:20:10] chasingsummer: pog edmonton boys
[2:20:12] kud0slol: apollo price
[2:20:12] razlol: @MedicCasts I will find you
[2:20:12] magiceye7278: based Canadian
[2:20:12] Thiccnuggie: lol medic
[2:20:17] ADrugge: But isn't part of being a pro player; building a brand? That way if you aren't on a team that you are left out to dry?
[2:20:22] BalloonHorses: "go flames" ApuApustaja
[2:20:23] chasingsummer: @esportsjatt we had record high temps this winter actually
[2:20:23] HereComesTheSunKing: I’m really glad that there’s been so much excellent content about pros this year. Helps them have a chance with content creation/streaming in the future
[2:20:24] MedicCasts: @razlol come get me ;)
[2:20:26] curryleague: we need a @Revenge vs bwipo podcast, I need a way to spend my 18 hour drives
[2:20:27] numiiigoesrawrz: another 20 minutes discussion LOL
[2:20:30] Bearus_Aurelius: @bearus_aurelius obviously there is a cost. it's worth it you make your money back quickly
[2:20:33] KSnOwnage: LUL
[2:20:35] esportsjatt: TWO Edmontonians are watching?
[2:20:42] numiiigoesrawrz: remember FLY and TL didn't drop academy teams
[2:20:44] chasingsummer: HeyGuys
[2:20:46] Darkallyht: i like this take
[2:20:46] leagueofemily: @MedicCasts fight fight fight
[2:20:49] c9_bobby: that's all of them
[2:20:49] yanya7701: @Tzames all the other leagues are in expensive cities just like LA. But their orgs still provide housing thats the difference
[2:20:50] Polowy: @esportsjatt Go Oilers <3
[2:20:54] Darkallyht: didn't think of the c9 take
[2:20:58] yuvikko: I’m from Calgary so very close to Edmonton!!
[2:21:25] esportsjatt: I went to NAIT and it snowed on me in June
[2:21:28] cubdave: Let's Go Red Wings!  (in edmonton tomorrow) :)
[2:21:28] razlol: #FlamesWin
[2:21:36] Tzames: @yanya7701 thats my point, they are all losing money, most likely.
[2:21:38] karlheinzstockfootage: @travisgafford you are correct.  i apologize.  the money you used to rely upon has nothing to do with any of this.
[2:21:42] chasingsummer: @esportsjatt thats basically a rite of passage
[2:21:51] aibaby: B beating A, is that what happened to TL spring last year Kappa
[2:21:55] Lyghtsaber: US Hockey > Canada Hockey
[2:22:00] BalloonHorses: raz the flames literally lost today lol
[2:22:02] yuvikko: @razlol yeee go flames 🔥
[2:22:10] grover2734: travis the goat
[2:22:18] travisgafford: @dalimccubist I think the only argument would have been Grubhub, but I don't think most people would consider Grubhub VC now at their scale
[2:22:28] Bearus_Aurelius: man, after all this, I am even more sad Revenge is leaving
[2:22:34] Pita26: wait did HLL chat just become a hockey chat?
[2:22:38] Bearus_Aurelius: such great insight
[2:22:43] BalloonHorses: @Pita26 yeh hockey eh?
[2:22:45] PapaSmithy: raz correct
[2:22:48] chasingsummer: @Lyghtsaber who do u think is playing on those american teams KEKW
[2:22:51] ProteusWest: Jatt is here, so no, it's an NBA chat now
[2:22:54] CouchyHOTS: based raz
[2:22:58] Thiccnuggie: 5head
[2:22:59] c9_bobby: we needed to seed SR with our academy team

[2:23:34] Ikancast: to the callers question i was surprised to hear C9 dropped their academy team because of how they were at the top of it for so many years
[2:23:42] curryleague: Bottom tier teams are bottom teams for a reason, if they don't make good decisions in LCS they definitely won't make good ones in Academy
[2:23:46] ProteusWest: was Raz one of the 90 percent useless coaches Revenge mentioned?
[2:23:50] numiiigoesrawrz: @papasmithy both coaches good ssh

[2:26:27] IAmMurdr: LOL
[2:26:27] Ikancast: flyquest has been a good org for valorant as well. when so many teams were leaving they picked up the clg red team a year ago or so

[2:26:42] leagueofemily: raz is just getting it from all angles tonight
[2:26:42] yuvikko: wait is Raz from Calgary
[2:26:43] curryleague: that guys a legend replace @raz with him PLAESE
[2:26:45] Lyghtsaber: baited and outsmarted
[2:26:46] Pita26: caller based
[2:26:47] foreverosiris: make it a 12 team league with 2 conferences, and have each conference on a different location and they travel to play the other conference but i might be crazy lol
[2:26:51] numiiigoesrawrz: @ikancast FLY red valorant 3rd place going into main event 🫡
[2:26:56] karlheinzstockfootage: weird thing flyquest became good after everyone forgot the olivee video
[2:26:58] BalloonHorses: I have no dog in the fight, im literally an Islanders fan but the oilers need a rebuild lol. Literally a two man team
[2:27:01] BalloonHorses: also the flames are mid
[2:27:10] leagueofemily: we call that an unforced error @razlol
[2:27:12] BalloonHorses: as are the islanders unfortunately
[2:27:15] karlheinzstockfootage: *ovilee
[2:27:16] Polowy: @razlol Im literally wearing my McDavid jersey atm lmao
[2:27:23] Ikancast: @numiiigoesrawrz yeah this new roster looks very stacked. got some of the best players from a few different ones i think they will go far
[2:27:26] Bearus_Aurelius: Bruins are the best anyway so it's fine

[2:28:11] soverhine: anymore? it never worked
[2:28:15] numiiigoesrawrz: love the LCS tell your friends
[2:28:20] numiiigoesrawrz: it's back and it's thriving
[2:28:31] curryleague: Way too early to call C9 superteam a failure
[2:28:32] karlheinzstockfootage: maybe if 10 teams
[2:28:32] numiiigoesrawrz: EG still in valorant btw
[2:28:33] Tameablebread93: lot of assumptions here for me
[2:28:33] Bearus_Aurelius: @bearus_aurelius it was rough, but they have been crushing this year!
[2:28:34] legendofivan: @soverhine bjerg double felt like a super team to me, best mid and ad on same team
[2:28:40] StxrmCoach: @numiiigoesrawrz no
[2:28:48] Ersean: as a viewer its good, as a pro player its bad
[2:28:55] HereComesTheSunKing: I feel like uplifting and  highlighting rookies is a separate issue from the number of teams in the league
[2:29:00] yanya7701: that C9 team is just bad roster decisions as I pointed out even before the split to Jack right on this show and he didnt listen a bit...
[2:29:04] numiiigoesrawrz: @stxrmcoach go watch LEC then 😠
[2:29:08] ProteusWest: NRG success didn't hurt, either
[2:29:11] StxrmCoach: :D
[2:29:19] legendofivan: @yanya7701 cant believe jack didnt listen2u
[2:29:20] karlheinzstockfootage: ask revenge his thoughts on sniper
[2:29:40] yanya7701: @legendofivan yeah bc he should have bc he didnt know what he was doing
[2:29:59] leagueofemily: travis turned into a bobblehead
[2:30:01] Mounizle: @dalimccubist he'll just respond with 🐀
[2:30:04] Mounizle: LUL
[2:30:06] Ikancast: thats what i think is the strong point as well. the extra spots to see more  players and give more paths to the league is important
[2:30:06] desemaia: what is an Americas league
[2:30:16] RudeDinosaur: @desemaia south america and north
[2:30:17] ProteusWest: we combine with LLA and Brazil
[2:30:18] Lyghtsaber: @desemaia NA + SA
[2:30:20] bustlinfungus: americas league will not be good for latam or brazil or NA
[2:30:28] Ikancast: @desemaia in valorant its Americas as a whole
[2:30:29] desemaia: @RudeDinosaur oh
[2:30:33] Mounizle: agreed hope they dont do that shit lol
[2:30:37] Bearus_Aurelius: Allow one substitution after champ select and teams can hire one-tricks
[2:31:01] zerovisible: BASED
[2:31:02] karlheinzstockfootage: tbf revenge/solo/fakegod are the same guy
[2:31:03] Ikancast: the rookies this year are doing great
[2:31:05] firadin0011: doubt
[2:31:26] ProteusWest: the fact they got in with fewer teams means they're good enough to be here with more
[2:31:28] Hack377: Would those spots not have been filled by imports if the teams had more money?
[2:31:33] yanya7701: yeah I am pretty sure LCS' shrinking budget is more of the reason why there are more rookies lol
[2:31:43] Todo88: Impact GIGACHAD
[2:31:44] BalloonHorses: "random imports" brings a few names to mind lolll
[2:31:52] yuvikko: I feel like teams would rather pay money for random import instead of the NA rookies if the league wasn’t downsizing
[2:31:53] BalloonHorses: *cough* castle
[2:31:54] legendofivan: ??? this sounds ambiguous as hell
[2:31:58] StxrmCoach: downsizing if anything cuts out potential rookies from even really giving it a shot
[2:32:00] firadin0011: no one was taking chances on rookies when they could pay for import
[2:32:04] Bearus_Aurelius: then umber of teams is irrelevant imo. all these teams imported instead of picking NA talent.
[2:32:15] karlheinzstockfootage: @Todo88 tru
[2:32:20] curryleague: A lot of random imports are just "scouting" done by coaches who don't understand the game and think they're smart
[2:32:23] leagueofemily: t r y o u t s a n d s c o u t i n g n e e d t o b e b e t t e r
[2:32:26] leagueofemily: or just exist
[2:32:28] oldgegamer: big names are for selling tickets, jerseys and sponsors… and teams are really hit and miss at doing that
[2:32:36] yanya7701: @yuvikko no rly, bc scouting in other countries also cost a lot of money
[2:32:51] Revenge: @curryleague BasedGod
[2:33:10] curryleague: scout someone and have no idea how they will fit in culturally or gameplay wise and set them up for failure
[2:33:13] BalloonHorses: IMT trying to provide logic for bringing in castle was so funny to watch
[2:33:17] karlheinzstockfootage: well best of 3's would let top swaps happen
[2:33:18] MattScoot2: revenge what are the worst imports the past few years
[2:33:32] Lyghtsaber: @leagueofemily that would mean management has to try
[2:33:39] RudeDinosaur: @curryleague  BasedGod
[2:33:44] leagueofemily: raz is killing it

[2:34:08] Todo88: You are too @leagueofemily SeemsGood
[2:34:10] ProteusWest: I wonder where Quid falls on that scale, in terms of scouting...he didn't seem like much last year, but he feels better
[2:34:10] c9_bobby: imo it's incredibly rare for an import to be great their first year. it's too big of a cultural/environment shift. they don't have the comforts of home to deal with stress
[2:34:10] Pita26: @leagueofemily high praise coming from the LCS broadcast GOAT
[2:34:12] razlol: EVERYONE SAY THANK YOU @leagueofemily

[2:35:15] Bearus_Aurelius: 5Head
[2:35:17] AyyeKaleb: I miss this or that Sadge
[2:35:18] HereComesTheSunKing: As an avid viewer of the LCS I hate this take

[2:35:20] ArkSoftware: *raz staring menacingly into his camera*
[2:35:20] leagueofemily: is this a paid call by Raz?
[2:35:21] ProteusWest: @leagueofemily NO, JUST EMILY
[2:35:22] numiiigoesrawrz: emily rand Fandom rise up
[2:35:24] kud0slol: true random luls
[2:35:25] goatcheesepleaselol: agreeeeeee more emily rand
[2:35:25] 23vulture: paidchatter

[2:35:31] Mounizle: randoms rise up
[2:35:31] am_kevin: hang up
[2:35:32] Pita26: @Tameablebread93 I've been hard stuck dirt since season 2

[2:35:33] razlol: #TRUERANDOM
[2:35:34] karlheinzstockfootage: emily doesn't like gen tho
[2:35:39] Vivimatsu: RANDOMS RISE
[2:35:40] HippoSquirrel: I agree with this take
[2:35:41] dropsofliquid: Kelsey was pog truuue
[2:35:41] yanya7701: what is "storylines in draft"
[2:35:41] skaiseu: give emily more segments #randomanalysis
[2:35:47] PVSunata: This is a good take
[2:35:52] Freezman13: RANDOMS #uniquemessage
[2:35:57] AyyeKaleb: Bassed Caller
[2:36:05] Avvura: very true
[2:36:07] golden_ks: agree
[2:36:07] cultLeader_: I think the end of day recap could be a little longer
[2:36:08] Bearus_Aurelius: @leagueofemily Boston represent! More Emily is always the play.
[2:36:10] karlheinzstockfootage: nope
[2:36:10] golden_ks: actually
[2:36:11] Ersean: i highly disagree this take, segments are awful. next game asap
[2:36:13] Todo88: Agreed
[2:36:15] melancholywriter: Yes I liked the analysis, it was great closure
[2:36:15] s0ybeans: agreee
[2:36:18] golden_ks: would love to hear some more analysis at the end of
[2:36:21] karlheinzstockfootage: i prefer the fast drafts
[2:36:24] c9_bobby: emily vs raz thumb war - who wins
[2:36:25] HereComesTheSunKing: The interviews have been way better this year… please don’t replace with hot air
[2:36:29] Hack377: Disagree, the extra analysis can be a longer post show. The expedited transitions are much better
[2:36:30] golden_ks: at least at the end of the
[2:36:30] Tameablebread93: disagree on the interview thing.
[2:36:31] julesSuperHD: Bring back the 30min analyst desk!
[2:36:33] shewasabulldozer: invite every member of the analyst desk for a special episode of the dive. six combatant chaos
[2:36:35] Pita26: @c9_bobby emily, easy
[2:36:36] MattScoot2: I like interviews, i also like analysis, i also like the short turnaround.
[2:36:39] Bullman_lol: emily 100%
[2:36:42] leagueofemily: @c9_bobby raz definitely has larger thumbs i have childlike sausage fingers sadge
[2:36:48] Avvura: XD
[2:36:51] Archique: Are we getting the PROs content videos as side-effect of fast transitions?
[2:36:52] PapaSmithy: i like the change they've made but I do worry they'll use positive fan sentiment to justify cutting more casters/anaylsts
[2:36:54] scrapabidoopimpaff: The transition time is really fsat rn, adding a extra 5 min for the analyst wouldnt hurt
[2:36:55] Bearus_Aurelius: unfortunately I think cutting down the analyst segments is necessary if you want more games/longer season
[2:36:55] c9_bobby: raz has long fingers i feel like
[2:37:01] ArkSoftware: cheeto fingers?
[2:37:01] karlheinzstockfootage: fast drafts mean best of 3's already cause only 8 teams
[2:37:06] numiiigoesrawrz: kangas on broadcast when :c
[2:37:12] OldManMovingSlow: more analysts  time before & after show
[2:37:14] dropsofliquid: I like the raiding player streams too
[2:37:16] RudeDinosaur: what about recapping last game while the draft that is already done is going on...actually that may not work idk
[2:37:26] Crawlsballs31: so funny when revenge said regard
[2:37:32] thoughtfulcoconut: why not just have a PGL type segment after the matches where you can go over some game things and story lines. you keep your short transitions and still give the fans who are actually interested their game content
[2:37:33] GreenCervidae: sots?
[2:37:45] Todo88: The Dive does that
[2:37:46] AyyeKaleb: I love watching The Space on LCK
[2:37:48] fatts33: it takes away from the main broadcast, but watching co-streams and listening to ex-pros/streamers talk about the game for the most part is the best way to get that in game knowledge
[2:37:48] oldgegamer: big agree.I think people connect to the human stories that bring them back each week.
[2:37:49] c9_bobby: raz is so much taller in RL than i thought he was
[2:37:52] cubdave: that's great because I don't need to watch the players do equpiment check during draft.
[2:37:54] numiiigoesrawrz: same bobby
[2:37:55] leagueofemily: we can also sometimes try stuff in casts like what kobe and i did with umti and bugi this week
[2:37:57] SarahDeeGee: I simultaneously love the games coming so fast and miss what was lost for it.
[2:38:01] AyyeKaleb: @c9_bobby in rocket league?
[2:38:05] LP_Phnx327: Unfortunately no likes analysis. If they do they'll seek it outside of the games. It's like how NBA halftime is like 3 min analysis and 15 min commercials
[2:38:05] SKlein: SKlein subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! This is the weirdest shit I’ve ever seen on Twitch and it’s not even close.
[2:38:05] Bearus_Aurelius: IMO, you can do segments like Pros after the broadcast and build up the players much better than increasing analyst segments
[2:38:05] leagueofemily: which ended up working out really well (but could have been bad ngl)
[2:38:07] c9_bobby: he's like 6' 5"
[2:38:09] shewasabulldozer: @thoughtfulcoconut to my knowledge they’ve freed up the time to film content w analysts + teams while teams are in studio
[2:38:10] Bearus_Aurelius: Raz is 100% right
[2:38:14] MattScoot2: @leagueofemily emily can we get more umti? hes such a good personality
[2:38:19] leagueofemily: actually i'm wondering how people even liked that (or whether they did)
[2:38:21] spudrat_: feel like the truth is that the time it takes to meaningfully dissect a game/communicate that to a general audience is too much and wouldnt be appreciated anyway
[2:38:23] cristobvl58: it works a little, i feel the conclusion whenever they have the player on casting for the next game
[2:38:23] HereComesTheSunKing: I actually wish draft was sped up 1.25x when we’re watching it
[2:38:23] curryleague: We love @razlol great take
[2:38:25] karlheinzstockfootage: well jeez raz, if you aren't on stream, you will do other things?
[2:38:29] cristobvl58: works at times*
[2:38:44] Crawlsballs31: yes the waiting blows, this is significantly better
[2:38:53] leagueofemily: +1 to what raz is saying i think it's about finding where we can fit in more analysis and we're still trying to find our footing
[2:38:54] leagueofemily: or like
[2:38:56] am_kevin: watching LEC today was brutal after the LCS change in turnaround times
[2:38:57] ellipticalmalcontent: i think a waiting room at the end would be good
[2:38:57] Hack377: Or during the pause that happens every game
[2:38:59] karlheinzstockfootage: also props to pat mahomes
[2:39:00] Tzames: yea but then our analysts are on screen for a total of 20 minutes every saturday
[2:39:00] ellipticalmalcontent: i would definitely watch
[2:39:00] leagueofemily: i know i am still trying to find my footing
[2:39:02] AyyeKaleb: Good thing Emily doesnt have to cast this weekend after KT loses to GenG ;p
[2:39:03] KSnOwnage: LUL
[2:39:06] cultLeader_: LUL
[2:39:07] yanya7701: fast transition works only for bo3 or bo5. For bo1 you gotta have some context and reviews bc they are different teams and ppl playing
[2:39:07] golden_ks: put a longer pre show and longer post show?
[2:39:13] ixbx: would be cool to see LCS YT content breaking down some of the games from a weekend
[2:39:21] ProteusWest: Nickelodeon broadcasts are actually really good
[2:39:29] c9_bobby: broadcast is goated so far, everyone has been amazing
[2:39:31] leagueofemily: @AyyeKaleb oh yea they're going to get owned T_T
[2:39:32] karlheinzstockfootage: nope
[2:39:32] bawzstatuz: we need dora to come on LCS
[2:39:33] Todo88: I'd love to see analysis breakdowns on youtube kinda like film study on NFL, but I don't know how popular it'd be
[2:39:34] Pita26: @ixbx wait this actually seems great
[2:39:36] dropsofliquid: and old fans that stopped playing so we don’t get confused too 😰
[2:39:56] c9_bobby: @leagueofemily you're doing TERRIFFIC

[2:40:21] Tzames: all pro mcdonalds
[2:40:26] tadeudca: Well I think the storytelling comes from teams and beef CLG x TSM is a great example and then riot expand or encourage this.. for me this was the best and it's lost
[2:40:34] Bearus_Aurelius: Mcdonalds hasn't been the same since they got rid of beef tallow. peepoSad
[2:40:35] Crawlsballs31: the biggest difference this years feels like the players are starting to promote themselves and more willing to do some type of content and teams pushing more content as well
[2:40:38] starperformer: LCS wants to be like Jimmy John's:  Freaky Fast
[2:40:46] leagueofemily: @AyyeKaleb aiming is on dk :3
[2:40:47] zzzChapter: hi revenge
[2:40:50] the1andonlycorbin: I've really enjoyed the broadcast and the LCS overall
[2:40:50] Ikancast: i do like how the broadcast had the solo queue accounts or reference what pros are playing in solo queue, but it would be nice if riot could provide clips from them playing these unusual picks
[2:40:51] leagueofemily: but also yea
[2:40:58] BeepImaJeep2015: monkaStare
[2:41:00] Pita26: @starperformer They gotta make sure to only deliver 1/3 of the games then
[2:41:02] scrapabidoopimpaff: Cant finish the show, will watch the rest on yt. Just wanted to say tonight we had a super good show w really great guest and interesting takes !
[2:41:12] karlheinzstockfootage: flowers is the only one i'd hate losing
[2:41:12] GreenCervidae: no pros streaming anymore tho :(
[2:41:14] leagueofemily: LMAO
[2:41:15] AyyeKaleb: @AyyeKaleb You right idk what im thinking LOL Deft is KT
[2:41:28] starperformer: @starperformer Well played
[2:41:33] leagueofemily: i won't fight redditors lmao
[2:41:38] leagueofemily: kelsey and i have our show!
[2:41:40] Crawlsballs31: the only way I see growth in the league is if you can partner with Mr. Beast or convince Tyler1 to partner to drive other league viewers the channel
[2:41:45] leagueofemily: but also i could do some jungle pathing videos
[2:41:48] Tzames: @Crawlsballs31 you say that but right now there are no pros streaming
[2:41:51] leagueofemily: since that's what really interests me
[2:41:59] ProteusWest: Emily disproving idiotic takes...hmm, I would definitely watch that
[2:42:01] spudrat_: @leagueofemily 👀
[2:42:03] leagueofemily: like everything i said before the TL/SR game about UmTi could have been it's own video
[2:42:06] Pita26: @leagueofemily ok but for real idiots like me would love this
[2:42:07] Bearus_Aurelius: @leagueofemily saw a Quinn Jungle solo clear in uner 3:30
[2:42:08] ixbx: @leagueofemily would love to see that stuff come out mid week on LCS channel
[2:42:14] Ersean: One of the good ones dropped was when they went over with a pro asking them go over what they were thinking at the moment.
[2:42:14] shewasabulldozer: I 1000% think there’s a niche for content that stakes out opinions without wading into community controversy, like more positive amping x than negative stamping y
[2:42:15] Bearus_Aurelius: Diamond players btw
[2:42:21] GodzillaGuerilla: BRING BACK RIFT REACTION!
[2:42:23] ellipticalmalcontent: @leagueofemily subscribe
[2:42:25] Pita26: Jungle breaks my brain and I would love to understand it better

[2:42:50] deekomode: KEKW 󠀀
[2:42:51] razlol: No Pant Pockets Ft Emily Rand
[2:42:57] the1andonlycorbin: Caster's Couch
[2:43:03] leagueofemily: Making the Rounds
[2:43:03] yanya7701: JLXP is so boring... Its not rly anything substantial just articulating what happened in the past
[2:43:07] SeverusSmoke: people sleep on Caster's Couch
[2:43:11] golden_ks: this caller tells the truth
[2:43:19] dropsofliquid: I like jlxp
[2:43:24] shewasabulldozer: @esportsjatt love JLXP, keep it up! I enjoy the stats & narratives
[2:43:28] bustlinfungus: i love jlxp
[2:43:32] Todo88: yep
[2:43:36] AyyeKaleb: @esportsjatt Bring back This or That with Kobe please <3
[2:43:36] leagueofemily: @razlol LOOK MY CLOTHING IS TROLLING ME
[2:43:40] Bearus_Aurelius: NRG has been looking ROUGH
[2:43:41] the1andonlycorbin: JLXP is great
[2:43:49] karlheinzstockfootage: drugs r fun tho
[2:43:58] HereComesTheSunKing: but the debate kids got college degrees lol
[2:44:00] Bearus_Aurelius: *music sgtarts playing*
[2:44:00] ArkSoftware: @dalimccubist ?
[2:44:04] HereComesTheSunKing: pro players don’t get that luxury
[2:44:17] leagueofemily: @razlol at least i don't leave candy in my pockets and it melts :3
[2:44:20] desemaia: okay buddy time to end the call

[2:44:56] PilgrimPanda: PilgrimPanda subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:44:57] wei309glwrgt: did they talk about why the league didn't move to best of three with 2 fewer teams?
[2:44:57] golden_ks: Good caller
[2:44:58] Todo88: Bwipo is a talker
[2:45:00] AyyeKaleb: WAY DOWN IN COCOMO
[2:45:00] LP_Phnx327: Lol what is happening in this chat between raz and emily
[2:45:01] ArkSoftware: @dalimccubist LUL
[2:45:03] dropsofliquid: @dalimccubist probably do from brain damage due to drug use 🤷🏼‍♀️😂
[2:45:04] leagueofemily: Bwipo is a content machine
[2:45:08] j_tripper: made up place
[2:45:09] karlheinzstockfootage: bwipo knows drugs r fun
[2:45:12] Crawlsballs31: love how honest bwipo was
[2:45:15] Crawlsballs31: need more of that
[2:45:20] Ikancast: i will have to watch that
[2:45:20] golden_ks: if you wanna call the show just do it, and push the rest of the takes to next week
[2:45:21] ixbx: the Bwipo ted talk was pretty sweet
[2:45:22] HereComesTheSunKing: I wish bwipo didn’t cut off insanity as much as he did
[2:45:24] ProteusWest: Bwipo definitely gave a lot of information
[2:45:30] Pita26: @leagueofemily Zven passing the baton?
[2:45:33] golden_ks: what’s the point of just rushing through the calls..
[2:45:53] c9_bobby: we need a Pros talk to Pros: Bwipo & Fudge
[2:45:55] GreenCervidae: YAPP
[2:45:55] karlheinzstockfootage: bwipo took a job from revenge
[2:45:59] dropsofliquid: I feel like they should have had Bwipo on alone. he took over
[2:46:04] karlheinzstockfootage: drugs r fun
[2:46:04] oldgegamer: sounds like LS
[2:46:10] zerovisible: yo bwips is str8 up on the spectrum
[2:46:33] LP_Phnx327: Nah Bwipo isn't like Zven. Bwipo has no filter like Zven, but Bwipo is willing to give credit where credit is due.
[2:46:37] chasingsummer: lmao
[2:46:38] PilgrimPanda: Actually great job describing what can be off-putting about Bwipo's communication style.
[2:47:00] StxrmCoach: it's good coontent tho and at the end of the day it was a content piece
[2:47:13] akio00: akio00 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:47:17] Todo88: Against Quid no less
[2:47:22] Ikancast: and i appreciate how insanity is willing to play these unusual champs. unfamiliar matchups come with growing pains and hope we see it get better
[2:47:23] Deuxblem: he was bausing
[2:47:25] karlheinzstockfootage: ppl on top play that match up
[2:47:25] Bearus_Aurelius: it was Brutal haha
[2:47:26] dropsofliquid: Bwipo was pretty much an ass about that tho 😂
[2:47:29] HereComesTheSunKing: Regardless of the truth I just wish that insanity had a chance to talk lol. It wasn’t just the aatrox thing it just became the bwipo show. Cool and all but I’m here for all pros.. I would watch Bwipos stream if I wanted that content
[2:47:29] headmomo: he was pressing him
[2:47:38] the1andonlycorbin: Great show tonight
[2:47:39] karlheinzstockfootage: mid not so much
[2:47:55] ProteusWest: that type of stuff isn't bad for the League, that is how rivalries get going
[2:47:58] IAmMurdr: I was impressed by Insanity tho, was a great episode of PROS
[2:48:04] ArkSoftware: respectful
[2:48:08] Crawlsballs31: that’s bc Bwipo is from EU. hes not afraid to be honest
[2:48:11] silvxoxo: silvxoxo subscribed with Prime. 
[2:48:14] PilgrimPanda: Insanity handled it well
[2:48:18] dropsofliquid: But Insanity seems chill he doesn’t seem like he wants a Bwipo rivalry
[2:48:22] Bearus_Aurelius: I've met a lot of Bwipos in my life. they don't have the best social skills imo
[2:48:22] ArkSoftware: he did
[2:48:23] bustlinfungus: its not cus hes from EU its cus hes bwipo lol
[2:48:24] Crawlsballs31: unlike soy boys from LA
[2:48:28] tadeudca: That's why I like the stories in basketball.. like Kobe and Shaq... You flame the other and push them to be better
[2:48:39] OG_Plumwick: i hate the "hes from eu" narrative LMA
[2:48:46] tadeudca: Brutal yes but honest
[2:48:49] spudrat_: is everyone from eu autistic
[2:48:49] yanya7701: NA just a delusional region LUL
[2:49:01] Bearus_Aurelius: what Bwipo said needed to be said though
[2:49:03] PilgrimPanda: Are you EU @OG_Plumwick ?
[2:49:07] nerfcapitalism: eu vs na fight fight fight!!
[2:49:09] LP_Phnx327: Bwipo is one of a kind.
[2:49:10] Nightbot: Curious about what Cubby gets up to when he's not on Hotline League? Follow him on twitter! https://twitter.com/Cubbyxx
[2:49:14] cristobvl58: Its fine for bwipo to ask those questions lol why yall crying
[2:49:16] OG_Plumwick: @PilgrimPanda irrelevant?
[2:49:18] Bearus_Aurelius: gotta go 10 more minutes
[2:49:22] shewasabulldozer: I like Bwipo but I think esports culture venerates the “straight shooter”/drama machine (Bwipo, Zven etc) a bit much and it’s off putting to viewers who find it awkward rather than/also being a banger
[2:49:23] PilgrimPanda: Generally curious
[2:49:24] Ikancast: it was fun though
[2:49:30] PilgrimPanda: Genuinely*
[2:49:30] OG_Plumwick: no
[2:49:35] yanya7701: bc the coach also does not know what hes doing
[2:49:44] julesSuperHD: I watched it lose for 5 mins then I watched the super bowl
[2:49:46] c9_bobby: misclick he was trying to lock tristana
[2:49:54] dropsofliquid: Maybe Olleh just locked it in for him after seeing winrate data.
[2:49:56] yuvikko: tactical build was pretty bad
[2:49:59] PilgrimPanda: Okay, I get not liking that narrative
[2:50:08] karlheinzstockfootage: @Crawlsballs31 eu is so great at honesty.  *eyeroll*
[2:50:31] BeepImaJeep2015: Summit told APA he was bad at everything except Ziggs, and got kicked to Brazil.
[2:50:39] shinwinter: or do it for the entertainment xdd
[2:50:51] Todo88: Summit aired that out on twitter didn't he?
[2:50:52] Ikancast: what i want to see is which ADC thinks they can play TF better and have the courage to pick it this next week of games. show us how it can be done
[2:51:04] karlheinzstockfootage: summit wasn'
[2:51:10] karlheinzstockfootage: t wrong
[2:51:12] Todo88: It's one thing to talk to your teammate and keep it within the team
[2:51:19] ProteusWest: Summit joined R7 so he pretty much guaranteed a trip to Worlds since he has had trouble getting there from NA
[2:51:23] Ikancast: brokenblade playing TF top lane was the most fun ive had watching league all year
[2:51:36] Crawlsballs31: @dalimccubist most people from EU don’t take things so personal like we do here. I’m not an EU fan I’m just saying it how it is
[2:51:38] juiceroot: MEMBA BREAKING POINT? meatcaLighter CurseLit CurseLit
[2:51:50] LP_Phnx327: I don't think Bwipo instigates, he's just honest. He talks from the games and matchup perspective and puts the onus on the player to maximize the play
[2:51:53] dropsofliquid: 😂

[2:52:16] desemaia: @Crawlsballs31 uh huh thats why there was a huge hate thread on nisqy because he was smiling after a loss
[2:52:17] Bearus_Aurelius: there is an Aristotelian mean here
[2:52:28] desemaia: @desemaia EU delusional af
[2:52:31] LP_Phnx327: Gotta get two mugs out of Aatrox when the ceiling on an Udyr is one mug
[2:52:37] Bearus_Aurelius: the line between virtue and vice can be small sometimes
[2:52:48] Cyanteal: Hard to tell Berserker maybe Lucian ain’t it
[2:52:53] Lyghtsaber: but when every player thinks they're the best... you get c9 kekw
[2:53:02] Todo88: LOL

[2:53:58] Ikancast: that makes sense
[2:54:21] Ersean: well jojo thought he could play akali when 100t already showed vi taliyah
[2:54:23] bustlinfungus: bold prediction
