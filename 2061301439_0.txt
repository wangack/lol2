[1:33:40] WonderboltBipen: before being buffed to op again
[1:33:46] shaaarktrox: @Aarguil yea aatrox is so unstable that a single nerf will make him shit he was shit for 6 patches when they did
[1:33:46] sept_mber: @xyz_abc that's dorans
[1:33:50] shaaarktrox: this how bad aatrox is
[1:33:54] shaaarktrox: in terms of balance
[1:34:07] DevondRiven: I'm already ready for illaoi to go back to shit tier @wonderboltbipen and she's only been super strong for 2 weeks 😂
[1:34:16] WonderboltBipen: Asol got 1 day
[1:34:17] shaaarktrox: i dont think my boi was stable for a single time
[1:34:17] WonderboltBipen: of OP
[1:34:22] WonderboltBipen: before being back to mid
[1:34:22] shaaarktrox: and i speak from experience
[1:34:23] imtrashipromise_: @shaaarktrox new items make him busted asf no?
[1:34:25] Nayako__: he has doran ring tho, that give 90pv
[1:34:25] shaaarktrox: i main him
[1:34:27] Nayako__: hp*
[1:34:32] Torappu: its like a 40 second cd at low levels
[1:34:32] imtrashipromise_: a nerf should make him fair
[1:34:59] shaaarktrox: @imtrashipromise_ they did sundered mixes so well with his kit and they made spear way better for his kit than before
[1:35:08] comsaqa: Riven so weak
[1:35:12] waitdontshootme: @Viper
[1:35:12] WonderboltBipen: people don't even go sundered sky
[1:35:24] WonderboltBipen: everyone does profane EoN and Last Whisper
[1:35:31] WonderboltBipen: like hes so op anything works on him
[1:35:33] shaaarktrox: @WonderboltBipen he has two builds lethality and bruiser he goes sundered on bruiser
[1:35:34] waitdontshootme: @Viper thoughts on upcoming Black cleaver build path change? worth building now?
[1:35:38] Alektorien: do you use s cancel on riven?
[1:35:40] imtrashipromise_: you just have aatrox bias
[1:35:44] imtrashipromise_: champ is broken
[1:36:08] xyz_abc: game is so tragic
[1:36:10] Nayako__: Sadge
[1:36:12] josh26965: the amount of times these gamers say “by the way is crazy”
[1:36:22] shaaarktrox: @WonderboltBipen lethality is high risk high reward you should take that build if you are really good at landing qs on aatrox if you arent going for a consistent build like bruiser is better
[1:36:29] EnderOCE: Chatting
[1:36:39] DevondRiven: I think the better chance there was just try to 1 for 1 on udyr for something but either way you're screwed with the wave
[1:36:43] KevinxGG: are you using u gg?
[1:36:51] yutipa: @josh26965 nah but
[1:37:11] shaaarktrox: lethality aatrox is only broken is ur really good at him

[1:37:47] DaysRiven: or afk
[1:37:51] josh26965: bro got solo destroyed by his opponent and is now trolling 💀
[1:37:56] shaaarktrox: because he lost a lot of sustain items its just plain lethality no shield from eclipse and no you cant touch him shit from dusk
[1:38:00] xyz_abc: solo destroyed is a take
[1:38:06] joelo_mm: Bro go top and eat udyrs ahh
[1:38:10] DaysRiven: bro didnt even get solod
[1:38:17] shaaarktrox: so you gotta play him right this time no space for misplay or you are pretty much done for
[1:38:36] josh26965: by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way by the way

[3:24:41] Arcleon_: Once he gets 3 items he can one shot
[3:24:45] vendettatrompeta: its D tier
[3:24:52] ahmedbeeeh: no its not weak at all that champ can one tap at lv 4
[3:25:03] sdihfu12: @ahmedbeeeh how

[3:25:19] Arcleon_: @ahmedbeeeh You don't want to know
[3:25:22] airflashh3: that champ can disengage well
[3:25:24] airflashh3: tbh
[3:25:49] sexinuggets99: yes
[3:26:07] Arcleon_: @lomeinb Actually no, the amount of high elo players that have no idea what he does is a lot more than you expect and they get caught off guard
[3:26:32] ahmedbeeeh: @sdihfu12  didn't play the champ at all but i saw darttut doing one tap at lv 4 multiple times
[3:27:13] vkaxd: @ahmedbeeeh a lot of champions can 1 tap at level 4 doesn't mean they're necessarily a strong champion
[3:27:14] sdihfu12: I feel like thats not the champ being broken and more people not knowing the champ
[3:28:15] yactavius82: lol afk?
[3:28:17] Arcleon_: @sdihfu12 It's still an assassin once it gets items it will one shot you
[3:28:26] maximumjoker869: what is your build?
[3:28:33] Zeiroth: I just stack armor vs riven and she cant kill me
[3:29:08] sdihfu12: @sdihfu12 so ur saying the champ is broken because once it gets items it can one shot you?
[3:29:14] sdihfu12: are u saying every assasin is broken
[3:29:19] sdihfu12: because they can one shot
[3:29:31] Stephenady: I could freeze
[3:29:35] Stephenady: But that's boring
[3:29:43] Arcleon_: yeah taking 2/3 of riven's hp there while being behind is clearly balanced
