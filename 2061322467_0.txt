[0:09:01] archie7497: Racoons are going to overdose today
[0:09:02] madiiiman: hylli put on. clinic
[0:09:24] madiiiman: unfortunately the clinic was pop up and the needles they used were handmedowns so everyone got infections
[0:09:32] madiiiman: hylli lost his medical license
[0:09:53] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: vpn?

[0:12:32] nickis211: Ksante is soko cool
[0:12:34] archie7497: Regarding lentils being ethical. Depends on where the lentils are being farmed to be honest. I know my fair share of farmer atrocities who do farming in India. Which is i think the second biggest producer of lentils
[0:12:45] hamid_dalton_toldo: Get ready to get triggered by oscar
[0:13:23] hamid_dalton_toldo: Not his best bo3 sadly
[0:13:31] madiiiman: no oscar wont trigger you so much as make you want to pull the trigger on yourself
[0:13:44] archie7497: Doms description of oscar as a ksante merchant fits appropriately
[0:14:01] madiiiman: oh look
[0:14:04] madiiiman: the turd is taking krugs
[0:14:04] SomeFerretGuy: cristoRACCOON

[0:16:57] archie7497: Jackspektra made a good point during the game. That naut flashed early to save hp so he can tank
[0:17:23] hamid_dalton_toldo: He lost every lane
[0:17:31] hamid_dalton_toldo: Like hard
[0:17:35] archie7497: *tank the tower on the dive
[0:18:11] fIuffee: Really important question monte: who is your favourite planescape torment companion?
[0:18:33] cryow1zard: tbh oscar couldve played a lot worse..
[0:19:23] madiiiman: monte google is taunting us using your stream https://imgur.com/a/gykB7jk
[0:19:35] fIuffee: I threw his ass back onto the pillar of skulls 😔
[0:19:51] sheald_bot: @MonteCristo What team do you think could pick up Irrelevant? He's too good for SK, but I don't know where he'd go.
[0:20:05] fIuffee: I will not elaborate unfortunately
[0:20:20] cryow1zard: irrelevant is not crazy good
[0:21:18] xeherxan: i think they should stick to this roster they done well i dont see any reason to switch

[0:21:56] RawssDeBawss: replace doss with targamas Kappa
[0:22:03] archie7497: Nah there is no way doss should be kept
[0:22:18] madiiiman: im actually so sad there is no way to get your worlds bangers only streams back...
[0:22:21] sheald_bot: @MonteCristo Do you think Hyli's Sett pick was objectively bad, or just poor execution?
[0:22:31] cryow1zard: at least doss stopped playing with his foot on the chair
[0:22:32] madiiiman: i meant to download them... but i forgot
[0:22:41] RawssDeBawss: how are you doing monte, I assume sleep deprived haha
[0:22:45] archie7497: Ideally doss should not even be in lec with people like parus trymbi kamilius in erl/bench
[0:23:09] madiiiman: yeah
[0:23:20] madiiiman: because they were hilarious
[0:23:25] Giiino: who needs worlds when we've got bangers only lcs vods
[0:23:25] madiiiman: and had 20x better analysis than the real broadcast
[0:23:31] RawssDeBawss: if I looked remotely like you did when perpetually tired, that'd be an upgrade for me lmao
[0:23:34] archie7497: This was a sick dive

[0:23:37] Kaljorlol: I have come to piss you off
[0:23:41] madiiiman: and because t1 vs jdg was historic and shudv been archived
[0:24:05] sheald_bot: Tank items seem still too OP. Games aren't good to watch when K'Sante or Udyr become unkillable.
[0:24:07] madiiiman: @fIuffee i find jjuggling abilities are diminished on meth. avoid the chainsaws

[0:25:39] madiiiman: Hyli and oscar fighting for the dade award in the regular season of LEC somehow
[0:25:56] Shimmerz: use the word sophistry to describe his tweets
[0:26:02] madiiiman: Kappa but monte Brazil is in north america

[0:26:16] PsychUps: willful misuse of statistics is a pet peeve of mine

[0:26:32] stalff: @MonteCristo this was the year it was easy to just not broadcast dyring the superbowl
[0:26:37] madiiiman: @Zebrios people still expect hyli to perform at times
[0:26:42] rfarleydude97: Watching Oscar this series made me depressed, its like watching Fudge @MonteCristo
[0:26:56] Zelgius: Viewership matters to zoomers that only want to watch games that aren't "dead"
[0:26:59] madiiiman: he needed flash for that monte
[0:27:01] madiiiman: thats why he saved it
[0:27:11] Zebrios: @madiiiman That's a failure on the viewers, tbh.  Hyli hasn't been great for years.
[0:27:12] RawssDeBawss: had several people told me the 49ers would win.
[0:27:19] Rodell: @MonteCristo
[0:27:19] kshyle: Actually just top vs the rest of the map
[0:27:21] kottbulle2: Does any of the team or LCS work with ROI or they just trying to milk the companies out of money without giving them any value back?
[0:27:30] RawssDeBawss: now I get to have a shit-eating grin when I talk about the superbowl with em now
[0:27:36] Zebrios: Irrelevant played his ass off this series
[0:27:41] LolBurbankraider: Oscarinin looking like Kyle Shanahan
[0:27:41] Rodell: @MonteCristo how tilted were you seeing john elway hand the lombardi over?
[0:27:44] sheald_bot: @Zelgius If you enjoy watching high-level play, viewership & health of the ecosystem are very relevant.
[0:27:47] madiiiman: @RawssDeBawss they did by every metric besides "refs refusing to call holding penalties to allow the chiefs to score 10 points they shouldn't have"
[0:27:49] SaltyLuigiKart8: anyone know if aatrox is supposed to win lane against ksante?
[0:27:54] PsychUps: he took like 6 free autos there in addition to the abilities
[0:27:55] Cinacho23: hes
[0:27:57] stalff: @Rodell elway looks tough lol
[0:28:05] Zebrios: @SaltyLuigiKart8 It's a wash lane, can go either way.
[0:28:05] VehementPhoenix: INTeresting flash
[0:28:16] Cinacho23: he has no vision so thinks rell is a lot closer than he is thats hwy hes playing like a little bitch
[0:28:19] Kaljorlol: Kaljorlol subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Thanks for saving my ass on InsightOnEsports
[0:28:19] SaltyLuigiKart8: @zebrios I see ty
[0:28:21] RawssDeBawss: @madiiiman in fairness 49ers fumbled a punt return lol
[0:28:45] RawssDeBawss: so you take 7 points away and then it's overtime at best.
[0:28:47] madiiiman: @RawssDeBawss no they didn't. the punt literally landed on the foot of a guy facing away from the kick and ricocheted
[0:29:00] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman my mans speaking the fight for me
[0:29:01] Zebrios: Elway is a literal legend.  He doesn't need a specific reason to be at a super bowl.
[0:29:29] RawssDeBawss: @madiiiman in fairness, how many weapons do the 49ers need to win a game lol
[0:29:46] Zebrios: @MonteCristo To be fair, pretty much everybody was getting dumpstered by the Broncos during that time.
[0:29:51] stalff: @RawssDeBawss just a good QB lol
[0:29:52] rfarleydude97: OSCAR IS INTING MAN
[0:29:53] LuxtheGod: niners went out of the super bowl how they went in, off a crazy lucky play
[0:29:54] rfarleydude97: CMON
[0:30:02] rfarleydude97: EU Fudge
[0:30:06] madiiiman: @RawssDeBawss in fairness wht does it take for a holding penalty to be called a single time in 5 quarters of play on the team who holds the most of the entire nfl?
[0:30:07] fruge2: chiefs outside of last 6 years were hot ass ppl forget lmao
[0:30:18] LolBurbankraider: i saw a post on reddit where someone said Elways was the most overrated qb of all time comparing his numbers to brady, peyton, and rodgers, who conveniently all played in an entirely different era
[0:30:25] Funew1: @montecristo are we not talking about very dif group of players?
[0:30:29] RawssDeBawss: @madiiiman I need to watch the game I guess XD
[0:30:29] SaltyLuigiKart8: he literally knew they were there xdd
[0:30:30] rfarleydude97: @fruge2 they started becoming decent from 2013-2017
[0:30:31] doomerop: Nisqy or Humanoid as a player to build your roster around ?
[0:30:37] LuxtheGod: lmao
[0:30:38] chaotic_dimension: LOL
[0:30:46] PsychUps: He popped sweeper, can't waste it Kappa
[0:30:50] fruge2: @fruge2 ye once andy came in a lot improved but alex smith at qb... yeah
[0:30:52] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Deductive reasoning requires at least 2 brain cells to contemplate more than 1 option.
[0:30:53] puyobwoc: puyobwoc subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:30:56] Clyde1500: the jury is still out on that
[0:31:14] Funew1: It is actually mental how many elimination series Fnc won in Lec by 1 game
[0:31:16] RawssDeBawss: @stalff 49ers made jimmy G look good XD
[0:31:18] madiiiman: anyone who thinks the chiefs didnt get favored by the refs is just a dishonest person who deosnt live in reality. im not kidding when i say 0 offensive holding were called on the chiefs. And theres literal clips of Nick Bosa being put in a half nelson and chokehold and Fred Warner being tackled at the LOS
[0:31:18] SomeFerretGuy: cowboyup backwards
[0:31:26] stalff: @MonteCristo oscar gonna have a mysterious injury for playoffs again

[0:31:30] LuxtheGod: coaches didnt go over object permanence yet
[0:31:31] puyobwoc: @SomeFerretGuy this guy gets it
[0:31:38] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman BASED
[0:31:44] Juicypika: KEKW
[0:31:50] fruge2: maybe tell kyle shanahan to call a competent 2nd half of football ever would also help
[0:32:04] puyobwoc: hello from wyoming. i go t oyour hometown to partake in local laws we dont have :D
[0:32:05] rfarleydude97: @fruge2 fk that Super bowl choker lol
[0:32:07] stalff: @madiiiman cope
[0:32:09] madiiiman: the chiefs shud have had 3rd and 26 and 4th and 11 to convert in order to win the game. objectively. if they do that? more power to them, but instead they were given 2 first downs and allowed to not lose
[0:32:12] RawssDeBawss: Oscarinin disappears
[0:32:25] RawssDeBawss: a wild SoaZ appears.
[0:32:30] puyobwoc: lmao
[0:32:40] Nem3an: oscarinin vs bin: who wins?
[0:32:42] SomeFerretGuy: uhh soaz is a coach
[0:32:43] madiiiman: @fruge2 shanahan actually didnt fuck it up last night in the second half outside of a couple poor play calls. he went aggressive when he needed to and didnt abandon the run
[0:32:43] Zebrios: Perhaps he is buying in-state and using it all before he goes home.
[0:32:43] jpegexe: good on you cowboy
[0:32:50] scrotemz: dont worry we do the same thing here in utah
[0:32:58] puyobwoc: i went to school in cheyenne and brother went to northern colo
[0:33:02] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: NOT THE FEDS oh no doood youre done for
[0:33:02] RawssDeBawss: my god, Soaz vs Bin
[0:33:05] Funew1: @montecristo why NA does this weird thing with East, West brackets for playoffs in all NA major sports
[0:33:13] RawssDeBawss: that 1v1 would be fucking mental.
[0:33:17] SomeFerretGuy: because america is enormous
[0:33:20] madiiiman: feds? did someone mention me?
[0:33:22] fruge2: @fruge2 id say not knowing to defer OT kickoff is also an issue, i liked the 4th & 3 call tho
[0:33:27] Rodell: @Funew1 the logistics
[0:33:33] Zebrios: The turn is good
[0:33:47] SomeFerretGuy: I have to assume you don't actually fathom how far across our country is
[0:33:50] KennyvonD: Q+Flash by VI was clean
[0:34:12] Ichigeki1: gj lol
[0:34:15] SaltyLuigiKart8: this aatrox xdd
[0:34:17] stalff: @Funew1 dallas is same division as new york in football
[0:34:23] sheald_bot: And even in basketball, the "Western" conference is loosely applied to some teams.
[0:34:37] rlctmario: Why would you defer the ot kickoff when 3rd possession wins sudden death. That is an advantage
[0:34:49] Funew1: @montecristo Mb than, but why they do it for Nba
[0:35:00] ASquishyLiquid: Yeah but I mean like why is it that 1 team can only face half the league in the superbowl only?
[0:35:02] jpegexe: waiting for oscar's Toney post saying he isnt injured and he doesnt know why he is benched
[0:35:18] madiiiman: @fruge2 you can make very strong arguments for both decisions in overtime tbh. and 90% of the time taking the ball first is objectively better to have first crack at sudden death. Again, they win if the chiefs arent allowed to hold every play. the chiefs 4th and 1 conversion becomes 4th and 11
[0:35:29] Zebrios: I think the east/west is supposed to create rivalries in local areas
[0:35:35] madiiiman: remember if both teams score, third posession is sudden death
[0:35:51] ASquishyLiquid: There's too many games for nba. Just have it like epl. One home game one away game vs every team
[0:35:53] Ichigeki1: @madiiiman getting it first its objectively better
[0:35:57] Ichigeki1: isnt*
[0:36:01] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman im convinced that even if it was 4th and 11, they would still find a way to pull something out of their ass
[0:36:07] JJisnice: JJisnice subscribed with Prime. 
[0:36:07] stalff: @madiiiman much better advantage knowing what/if your opponet scores
[0:36:10] lazink: But you are going against Mahomes.. that factors into it too
[0:36:13] Ichigeki1: when you go 2nd you play with more info that the team who takes first
[0:36:17] madiiiman: @rfarleydude97 another holding penalty yes
[0:36:20] Funew1: @montecristo that makes, I have another question. Why NFL playoffs are bo1
[0:36:20] ASquishyLiquid: Don't make the eastern/western conf champions the winners of the semis. Make it the winners of the regular season
[0:36:22] LilGimli: irrelevant trying so hard this series
[0:36:34] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman spelled OPI wrong

[0:36:38] Ichigeki1: @Funew1 are you trolling?
[0:36:42] SkippyPeterson: LUL
[0:36:47] madiiiman: @stalff if you think you can score a touchdown its much better to be first because then you either immediately win at end of opponents posession, or have sudden death priority after it
[0:36:48] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: Cause they are soft Kappa
[0:36:49] stalff: @MonteCristo dont take the trash
[0:36:49] rfarleydude97: EU BRAINS KEKW
[0:36:51] Funew1: No I am not
[0:37:00] Zebrios: The advantage of deferring OT kickoff is knowing whether it's safe to field goal. First possession doesn't have that luxury.
[0:37:00] SomeFerretGuy: cristoRACCOON
[0:37:03] theplasticlego: trueeee
[0:37:06] Kaljorlol: The amount of concussions yikes

[0:37:09] jackypoo25: DAMN
[0:37:11] Faaaux: hahaha
[0:37:12] TheBasedTaka: i could do 3 games a day
[0:37:23] lazink: @madiiiman no, Reed said he was going for 2 no matter what
[0:37:25] gersontheperson: are the rugby leagues bo1 as well? I feel like thats the closest comparison
[0:37:25] Funew1: @montecristo don’t call it soccer
[0:37:27] fruge2: @stalff but other team is literally always going for 2 and knows exactly what it needs
[0:37:27] EndroF12: meanwhile guy gets injured trying to get on the field in superbowl lmao
[0:37:27] madiiiman: @Zebrios if you believe you will score a touchdown, first is better 100% of the time
[0:37:30] Ichigeki1: @Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny rugby is a diff sport
[0:37:32] jpegexe: swap top laners this series and it would have been a quick 2-0
[0:37:33] ProfessorCl0ckw0rk7: football being a more than single elim.. i would throw up
[0:37:37] Ichigeki1: its no where near as dangerous
[0:37:41] Ichigeki1: more small brain
[0:37:48] stalff: @fruge2 no, they just got for 2lol
[0:37:52] Gh0stStyle: just look at all the nfl players dying from cte
[0:37:54] SomeFerretGuy: rugby lack of pads vs american football is like the difference between gloves and bare hands in boxing
[0:37:57] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: WAIT WHAT, they run it straight  lol
[0:37:59] pekkaju: Why isnt mma bo7
[0:38:02] Giiino: nfl players already get injured more playing thursdays on short weeks, imagine doing a series of games lmao
[0:38:03] rfarleydude97: @MonteCristo what sports did you play growing up?
[0:38:03] SomeFerretGuy: gloves are way more dangerous
[0:38:05] Ikkarrow: like I as an NFL fan would love to some how see best of 3s but there is no way any players could play more games with out more injuries
[0:38:11] madiiiman: @lazink yeah and shanahan has no way of knowing that
[0:38:13] TheBasedTaka: but rugby has only head guards no?
[0:38:16] fruge2: @fruge2 if you're getting ball first in OT and leading going for 2 you are trolling
[0:38:26] Zebrios: @madiiiman That's a lot of pressure in a championship game, and it depends on whether you have more faith in your offense or defense.
[0:38:31] Ichigeki1: also, when you have pads,mentally you hit harder
[0:38:42] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: As someone from NZ I wanna say some of the facts may be a bit skewed
[0:38:42] stalff: @fruge2 meant to reply to other guy, but i meant if youre 2nd you go for 2 and win
[0:38:48] Ichigeki1: you will think your more protected than you are and will hit harder
[0:38:55] Funew1: Chiefs not being favorites by betting odds for next season despite winning back to back is weird.
[0:38:57] madiiiman: @Zebrios point is, there is nothing wrong with taking the ball first. remember that the 49ers defense had just had a long drive and needed rest
[0:39:08] fruge2: @fruge2 ye agree mb
[0:39:14] madiiiman: @Funew1 the defense is kinda fucked tbh
[0:39:16] lazink: @madiiiman that is just false
[0:39:22] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: @TheBasedTaka No thats more to protect your ears
[0:39:25] stalff: @madiiiman thats just not correct lol
[0:39:28] Zebrios: @madiiiman It's just a stylistic choice.  Neither is superior, but there are reasons to choose either.
[0:39:35] Funew1: I am just trying to get some info about NFL because I won money on Chiefs LOL
[0:39:46] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman was I one of the few that actually liked they elected to receive the ball? why put the 49ers on defense after watching that last series? dudes needed a big breather
[0:40:00] Ichigeki1: @rfarleydude97 because you play with less info
[0:40:03] stalff: @rfarleydude97 they had 7-9 mins to rest
[0:40:05] madiiiman: @stalff interesting considering what i just said is not an opinion but a fact. Literally shanahan said the defense needed rest and that was his main reason
[0:40:09] lazink: @madiiiman the drive was a minute and 39 seconds or so.. with 2 time outs used, one 3 minute commercial break, and then another 2 minutes for the OT setup
[0:40:12] SomeFerretGuy: LuL
[0:40:15] Ichigeki1: taking it 2nd gives you more info on your drive
[0:40:19] SomeFerretGuy: swiftee joke poggers
[0:40:20] fruge2: @Ichigeki1 this
[0:40:26] stalff: @madiiiman well thats great, now they can rest till september
[0:40:31] stalff: @Ichigeki1 yes
[0:40:50] cryow1zard: louis Vuitton senna
[0:41:03] Nem3an: explain the joke pls
[0:41:06] archie7497: Something I have noticed about humanoid's hwei is that he doesn't use the w-e enough. He mainly uses the w-q speedup
[0:41:09] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: I'll make one point, the stop and go aspect of the NFL sport makes those moments more intense. But playing 90mins of hard tackling action where you have to participate in rucks and scrums is waaaay harder imo
[0:41:14] Zebrios: @madiiiman Also, OT in the Superbowl is nearly unprecedented, so it likely wasn't something they prepared for.  This is only the second time in NFL history.
[0:41:21] madiiiman: im sorry but if you think going second is objectively better you are not a serious person. its all situation dependent and also matters who you are against. you cna make very strong arguments for both, and hindsight bias is massive. if they won nobody wud be criticizing it
[0:41:23] Clyde1500: there was a louis vuitton sponsorship?
[0:41:29] SomeFerretGuy: and skins!
[0:41:34] KennyvonD: oooh great ult by nisqy
[0:41:42] Adanion: @Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny ofc it is, playing t the point of exhaustion and beond is way more effort
[0:41:42] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[0:41:43] Ichigeki1: @Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny its a diff sport completetly, saying one is "harder" is apples to oranges
[0:41:44] SomeFerretGuy: prestige LV skins
[0:41:51] stalff: @Zebrios thats why the chiefs studied the rule every week and twice for the SB
[0:42:00] TheBasedTaka: idk how louis vuiton would ever convert sales from a video game
[0:42:07] SomeFerretGuy: china
[0:42:14] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: @Ichigeki1 so exhaustion isnt comparable + damage?
[0:42:21] stalff: @madiiiman you have more info if you kickoff, its that simple
[0:42:35] lazink: @madiiiman first off, why are you playing the futures game that much, if this then this then this then this.. that's overthinking it. Second, when you get the ball 2nd, you are playing for 4 downs, not 3.
[0:42:36] Ichigeki1: your comparing 2 diff things and adding the one thing all sports have in common lol
[0:42:39] madiiiman: @stalff ffs, the chiefs determined that they would prefer to go second based on their game plan. another team can feel its better for their game pln to go second. you cant just go "oh the chiefs wanted second so its a mistake to go first" when nobody even knew what the chiefs wanted in the first place
[0:42:42] Zebrios: @TheBasedTaka Well, to afford LV, you'd have to be a whale.  Maybe there's a correlation.
[0:43:00] SomeFerretGuy: my theory is simply they only advertised at worlds because the rich chinese folks care about it
[0:43:12] Ichigeki1: ^
[0:43:20] lazink: @madiiiman third.. know the rules of OT, the ref explained them clearly to EVERYONE, yet the 49ers admitted they thought if they scored a TD they won
[0:43:22] Ichigeki1: wouldnt be suprised if it was legit that
[0:43:24] fistigons25: fistigons25 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! let’s go!!
[0:43:27] Kaljorlol: Is Kindred any good in pro these days? Asking for a friend
[0:43:29] archie7497: @montecristo can you comprehend why lec doesn't play udyr? Similarly why is lec the only league playing hwei regularly?
[0:43:35] SomeFerretGuy: is your friend pyosik Susge
[0:43:56] madiiiman: @lazink a couple of players thouht that. and mecole hardman didnt know the chiefs won when he scored, doesnt change the facts that you cant just determine second is better
[0:43:56] Zebrios: Hwei punishment is very harsh in LCK/LPL
[0:43:56] sheald_bot: Humanoid the only Corki.
[0:44:04] Sodo_Mojo: can't play Udyr into GODS PepeLaugh
[0:44:21] jpegexe: oscar just hard inted this fight i feel
[0:44:29] SomeFerretGuy: someone in an na content forget who claimed that corki fell out of favor because people figured otu how to play around it
[0:44:29] KennyvonD: just not enough consistent damage on FNC side
[0:44:40] Funew1: @montecristo they watched Zeka and think Corki is bad
[0:44:45] Zebrios: @MonteCristo Irrelevant was my MVP for the series, in spite of losing.
[0:44:47] gersontheperson: ksante being the best hyper scaling champ this game
[0:44:48] sheald_bot: Yeah, Hwei mid seems to get camped very hard by Vi or a strong engage JG in East
[0:45:03] madiiiman: saying its objectively better to go second is just wrong, plain and simple. you cant claim that because there are more factors to it than the 4 down and scoring knowledge, whether or not you value them s much, other teams might.
[0:45:06] jpegexe: there is no way oscar is supposed to just dash into the pit. for funplayer
[0:45:23] madiiiman: you cant claim either is better
[0:45:46] riley_bruce_: this series couldve been so quick if Oscar did literally anything
[0:45:54] kshyle: don't worry there's more Oscarinin team fighting coming @MonteCristo
[0:45:55] Respect_Dat1: @madiiiman agreed, there's a lot of study against the team you're playing against and the current standing of your offense/defense against said team
[0:46:17] madiiiman: how about your defense having an extra 8-10 minutes to setup up schemes and  blitz packages for the ONE stop to win the suepr bowl? cud be a big advantage to have that by going first. doesnt matter if thats what they used it for, the point is its there and a factor and you cant dismiss it
[0:46:21] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: Humanoid making xayahs life miserable here
[0:46:34] QuackTheDuck: senna giga outscales right?
[0:46:37] Funew1: @montecristo what is your opinion on Mdk making top 4? I think it is because they kept system they already built in Mrs.
[0:46:43] madiiiman: and if both teams had scored a touchdown, wed be saying first was objectively the right choice

[0:46:45] MayniBK: Oscar has been terrible in playoff
[0:47:04] madiiiman: you cant just use hindsight to claim you know what was better, its a fallacy and makes you look stupid
[0:47:16] sheald_bot: Senna scales well, but not as relevant when the other team is all full built.
[0:47:21] QuackTheDuck: FNC doesnt need to contest drag right? they should just scale?
[0:47:28] sheald_bot: Not many games reach that point though.
[0:47:57] LilGimli: nisqy going deep for nautilus
[0:48:03] LilGimli: worth LUL
[0:48:05] riley_bruce_: @madiiiman the hindsight from the super bowl is always wild. I saw some tweet from a news source asking "what do you think of Brock Purdy?" after that super bowl
[0:48:06] Kaljorlol: Oscarinin ain't OscarWinning
[0:48:11] rlctmario: What do you think of smolder so far?
[0:48:14] archie7497: Hwei's biggest problem is mana issues so if you get ocean soul its really good for him.
[0:48:29] KennyvonD: facetanking Aatrox is not ideal
[0:48:39] sheald_bot: @archie7497 What? Hwei has no mana issues after Lost Chapter lol.
[0:48:39] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: Check Aatrox's paypal after this, I swear hes trying to throw
[0:48:51] madiiiman: @riley_bruce_ i think he objectively outplayed mahomes for over half the game and his 2 big missed throws came from the blocking scheme being fucked and chris jones being untouched in his face after half a second
[0:48:55] Funew1: It is same script again. Fnc dropping to loser bracket, climbing to finals to lose G2.
[0:49:05] madiiiman: if either of those are blocks, niners have another 7 points
[0:49:17] madiiiman: and there is no excuse for chris fucking jones being unblocked
[0:49:42] del1nquency: game 3 waiting room PepeLaugh
[0:49:45] henxry934: its meh lord monte
[0:49:56] madiiiman: if the kicker makes the PAT the 49ers outright win in regulation and the overtime discussion isnt happening at all
[0:50:01] rfarleydude97: @madiiiman yeah idk what the fuck was going on with the blocking
[0:50:11] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: aint no way 2 ults for a rakan
[0:50:14] madiiiman: if the KC kicker doesnt have the luckiest punt in the history of football, the chiefs literally have 0 touchdown all game and lose by 10
[0:50:16] Kaljorlol: Man I miss the 2013 through 2016 era of League
[0:50:17] archie7497: @sheald_bot mate he runs oom with blue and lost chapter mid to late game. That's the biggest complaint I'm heard from people who play hwei.
[0:50:42] madiiiman: if the refs call offensive holding any number other than ZERO times, the chiefs dont score 3-10 points
[0:50:53] Funew1: Crazy how KC went from struggling in Lec to winning super bowl
[0:51:09] madiiiman: @Funew1 yamato really was the problem i guess Kappa
[0:51:31] rfarleydude97: Switching from Yamato to Andy Reid was the call
[0:51:33] sheald_bot: @archie7497 His WE spell literally makes him regain most of his mana used on Q and E spells. You'd have to go through twenty spell rotations non-stop to have an issue.
[0:51:34] rfarleydude97: lmao
[0:51:39] xMisterGrey: he did smite
[0:51:40] xMisterGrey: its on cd

[0:51:49] echo_17y: they failed smite + xayah e against single smite
[0:52:14] Jeffp2662: oh yeah he failed
[0:52:31] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: weird that vi wasnt even marked out of pit either lol
[0:52:48] dowiet: vi is a weird looking baron
[0:52:55] KennyvonD: Nisqy has been double edged sword. Some good ults but some absolute bonehead decisions too
[0:53:01] madiiiman: heres a fun thought exercise. if one team goes into halftime and their main adjustment is "we will hold on every play" and then sudenly in the second half, none of the pressure is reaching mahomes anymore, and you can see the linemen all bear hugging bosa and young. nd then the refs NEVER throw a flag... The players just wont sotp doing it until penalized, and if allowed to do so, the reason the 49ers were dominating the game is gone
[0:53:19] madiiiman: esxcept its not a thought exercise, its outright what happened
[0:53:41] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: Why not let ksante solo keep the others away and rakan keep vi away
[0:53:41] Giiino: @madiiiman how much sleep you lose over that lol
[0:53:57] Fissiccisst: oh right, the handegg world championchips happened. who won?
[0:54:03] stalff: @madiiiman the cope is real
[0:54:09] madiiiman: @Giiino none, i knew at the end of the 3rd quarter the 49ers wud have to break past the holds or lose because they werent going to ever flag it
[0:54:11] SkippyPeterson: been complaining about holding in the game for 45min
[0:54:22] Felihero: @Fissiccisst Taylor Swift did
[0:54:31] madiiiman: @SkippyPeterson no i had to deal with morons not understanding hindsight bias for about 25 of it
[0:54:34] Fissiccisst: @Felihero republicans still butthurt are they?
[0:54:53] stalff: @madiiiman AND if the chiefs dont fumble they win AND this AND that. stop playing in make believes and IFS
[0:55:03] QuackTheDuck: FNC has soul and they outscale there is no way they lose right?
[0:55:04] Jeffp2662: not sure what Jun thought was going to happen
[0:55:05] rfarleydude97: Oscar man
[0:55:16] bigpapa421: oscarinin was awful this series
[0:55:23] jpegexe: he likes to hit tanks as lethality aatrox
[0:55:23] sheald_bot: @Fissiccisst True right-wingers, respecters of beauty, respect Taylor Swift.
[0:55:24] bigpapa421: even in their wins
[0:55:37] KennyvonD: Naut started that engage...
[0:55:38] rfarleydude97: he literally is the kid in a group who didnt do shit in the project and still got a passing grade
[0:55:50] QuackTheDuck: naut was trolling
[0:55:52] Funew1: @quacktheduck they don’t, there is enough frontline for Azir and Xayah to carry team fights
[0:55:54] madiiiman: @stalff so we are clear, you are of the belief none of these plays are penalties? https://imgur.com/a/0oCAYfc
[0:56:07] Jeffp2662: good ole EU counter throw
[0:56:08] KennyvonD: This is some bad league of legends
[0:56:14] QuackTheDuck: @Funew1 senna outranges tho
[0:56:20] stalff: @madiiiman i just dont care man, youve been on it for a hour, they lost... calls get missed both sides
[0:56:28] madiiiman: @stalff massive difference between player fuck ups and the refs not doing their literal job
[0:56:36] Clyde1500: wdym it's great? RaccAttack Clap

[0:56:53] madiiiman: to be clear if they miss a couple calls, i dont care. but you ccant throw ZERO flags when its happening every play
[0:56:54] sheald_bot: Idc about football, but I see madii's point. Chiefs get the Lakers treatment, for sure.

[0:59:56] madiiiman: @stalff still didnt answer whether those are penalties in the link
[1:00:05] madiiiman: until you do, you dont get an opinion
[1:00:28] madiiiman: either admit they are penalites or say there is no holding occuring
[1:00:30] Funew1: @montecristo I think in next lcs week we get answer does C9 win spring. If they look semis decent they probably win by Jojo Berserker star power. If they look bad after 2 weeks break, they probably just don’t win spring.

[1:01:58] KennyvonD: Ksante zoned out Vi again for easy baron.
[1:02:04] madiiiman: @stalff ok, then its not cope. im stating facts. and this is not like i hate the chiefs. i hate that the nfl feels it has to prop up one of the best players ever instead of just letting them be great. if Mahomes converts 3rd and 26 and 4th and 11 to win, its one of the best sequences in nfl history. we are robbed of good stories nd left with bullshit because refs choose to dictate the outcome of the most important game

[1:02:37] mikers5: @MonteCristo ask yamato prob has something to do with where he is from :just a thought:
[1:02:48] madiiiman: but his wife and brother need to just disappear from the public eye, they are going to fuck up his life tbh
[1:02:48] demazLol: xD g3 is the banger part of this series @MonteCristo  xD
[1:03:06] Whalesandowls: dude watching Hyli gave me hypertension that I almost rushed to a clinic near by… it’s too much this split..
[1:03:06] QuackTheDuck: FNC has SOUL how can they lose this?
[1:03:28] azaley_dayinghe: Nisqy the real bro, who does not let his ex teamate down, after watching Hyli
[1:03:33] demazLol: Because Oscar literally doesnt do anything in most fihghts @QuackTheDuck
[1:03:40] Funew1: Ocean soul carry you in long fights. Azir and Xayah deal to much dmg to fast.
[1:03:44] MierinEronaile: PepeLaugh
[1:03:48] FlexGod: flank to die combo
[1:03:56] mikers5: 45 mins LUL
[1:04:03] cerealkillas22: JEJW
[1:04:07] xeherxan: its dat lec we love
[1:04:08] stalff: @MonteCristo why did the LEC just fall off a cliff? what happened
[1:04:12] Jeffp2662: it only gets more insane
[1:04:12] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: thank god oscar is throwing equally as hard for this team
[1:04:14] OceanLegacy: this game is disrespectful to league of legends
[1:04:22] Funew1: Funny game
[1:04:22] mikers5: "banger" LUL
[1:04:25] QuackTheDuck: that tp by nisqy won them the game Kappa
[1:04:27] kraethan: 47 kills in 43 minutes
[1:04:33] KennyvonD: Irrelevant gotta be happy, they didn't throw that game after his heroics
[1:04:35] kraethan: cristoRACCOON
[1:04:38] madiiiman: BUT WAIT THERES MORE MONTE
[1:04:40] deadpoool04: NRG owns LEC now KKona
[1:04:42] rlctmario: What do you think of smolder so far?
[1:04:43] bigpapa421: @MonteCristo u think BDS could be good internationally though?
[1:04:55] QuackTheDuck: BDS seems like headless chickens vs G2
[1:05:02] JaKeBoTLuL: it only gets better
[1:05:02] ace_alchemist: PepeLaugh he is unaware
[1:05:05] riley_bruce_: oh just wait monte it gets worse
[1:05:15] EmailmanLOL: i was not hard while watching
[1:05:15] xeherxan: its gonna be harder when you watch vitaly
[1:05:18] Funew1: @montecristo is G2 good, exactly this G2 line up did not do anything intentionally
[1:05:18] cerealkillas22: whatcha think of TF ADC, ive been playing it it does crazy DPS
[1:05:22] brissings: Is middle of the pack lcs better than middle of the pack lec?
[1:05:29] deadpoool04: G2 is not good internationally LUL
[1:05:40] RomanticCreampie: will mages ever not be broken in pro?
[1:05:40] azaley_dayinghe: DFM is an asian team
[1:05:50] QuackTheDuck: NA is better than G2 and G2 makes BDS look like a minor region
[1:05:52] madiiiman: g2 did what t1 did to  the lck for. a bit. all the new "it teams" that had promise ran into them and it was a wall they cant pass so they eventually broke up and talent scattered. like the kt superteam and rox tigers etc
[1:06:13] xeherxan: they did beat asian team at world even tho its bo1
[1:06:25] deadpoool04: PepeLaugh
[1:06:35] jman3213: what’s the purpose of having playoffs so early?
[1:06:35] unkn0wnm1: PepeLaugh
[1:06:38] xeherxan: @QuackTheDuck thats copium
[1:06:48] Jeffp2662: no way
[1:06:52] QuackTheDuck: Zac blind?
[1:06:52] deadpoool04: PepeLaugh 󠀀
[1:06:53] madiiiman: ive said for years one team being dominant nonstop for 5+ years is bad for a region and kills the overall skill level of the region below them
[1:07:02] RomanticCreampie: azir ResidentSleeper
[1:07:02] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[1:07:05] azaley_dayinghe: Vietnam is an asian team, and BDS beat one of them.
[1:07:21] Funew1: @asquishyliquid unlike TL
[1:07:27] QuackTheDuck: Why ashe into the naut? isnt naut a counterpick to ashe?
[1:07:28] Funew1: @azaley_dayinghe
[1:07:41] madiiiman: LEC will improve if/when g2 eventually falls off, like for real falls off
[1:07:46] madiiiman: until then, they are hard capped
[1:07:47] Funew1: I made fun of liquid and accidentally tagged someone with liquid in name LOL
[1:08:07] SomeFerretGuy: Sadge
[1:08:22] madiiiman: g2 cant get any better (and actually get worse internationally each year) because they have no competition and dont even have to care about regular season at all
[1:08:28] madiiiman: no other team can pass g2
[1:08:31] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: @QuackTheDuck They just wanna shove early, whether they capitalise on that is another question
[1:08:34] madiiiman: entire region trapped in purgatory
[1:08:43] xeherxan: choose KC
[1:08:49] SomeFerretGuy: but but my 10 years of fandom D:
[1:08:52] Nem3an: @madiiiman they are dominant because the other teams suck, not the other way around
[1:08:55] Giiino: ride or die with TL, sooner or later that big wallet will pay off
[1:09:01] LastArchangeI: kinda bold coming from Mr. KT himself lol
[1:09:07] Fissiccisst: sunk cost fallicy
[1:09:08] Kaljorlol: I liked TL when it was all about Piglet and Fenix but fuck me that's a long time ago
[1:09:20] theplasticlego: What do you mean Yeon is best adc Na Kappa
[1:09:21] stalff: @MonteCristo not a KT fan talking about letdowns !?
[1:09:27] SomeFerretGuy: given me several jerseys and about a hundred bucks on steam from liquid plus actually
[1:09:28] Whisperkill_: I've been a KT and TL fan since 2009 and I hate myself for it
[1:09:34] Baerian: breaking point was peak
[1:09:43] MoldyCalzone: D:
[1:09:45] MierinEronaile: D:
[1:09:46] madiiiman: @Nem3an occasionally for a split or two yes, but overall they have been a talent vaccuum most of their existence. it started with poaching caps. that unironically started the slow decline of the entire region. they got one year of opportunity, and it cost them the next decade likely
[1:09:48] holyspud_: D:
[1:09:49] nickis211: There were so many plays missed today on LEC with only one observer, so tragic
[1:09:50] Fissiccisst: cristoTRAIN
[1:09:53] pabloam92kappa: D:
[1:09:54] Fissiccisst: off we go
[1:09:55] MrHandsomeNoodle: keane?
[1:09:56] demazLol: LOL of course GEN G
[1:09:57] brissings: Steve did a gaming compound tour though
[1:09:58] Funew1: @montecristo imagine if Kt wins worlds this year
[1:10:08] CheerUpYoureBeautiful: same
[1:10:09] stalff: @MonteCristo but... beryls ali game the other week...
[1:10:14] LastArchangeI: Monte. famous Afreeca 2018 fan
[1:10:18] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: real Gs support OK BRION
[1:10:18] Giiino: steve did release breaking point which was electric
[1:10:22] madiiiman: monte I cant fault the liquid fan because I was a die hard Jin Air fan for 5 years
[1:10:31] MierinEronaile: kt flash FeelsBadMan
[1:10:42] Fissiccisst: SpeedL cristoTRAIN GenG here we come
[1:10:47] eric101101101101: jin air is so based
[1:10:48] MoldyCalzone: KT Arrows' Arrow
[1:10:49] madiiiman: monte betrayed KT
[1:10:56] Sodo_Mojo: literally LUL
[1:10:58] Adanion: KT Fingerboom always will be the best KT surely
[1:11:00] myst1c_cupcake: i just follow players
[1:11:00] bigpapa421: fearx > kwangdong
[1:11:02] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: @madiiiman Jin Air was good at the sc2 team player though :D
[1:11:03] eric101101101101: azubu blaze fan her btw
[1:11:07] LilGimli: surely cuzz stock is through the roof after these last 2 years
[1:11:11] madiiiman: @Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny i ment for league specifically
[1:11:14] SomeFerretGuy: I love suffering, being a liquid fan is a heart attack in every game we can't just play clean games anywhere
[1:11:15] brissings: imagine being a nukeduck fan since lemondogs
[1:11:21] Nem3an: @Nem3an two years ago, they had targamas and flakked. last year they had yike as a rookie. there's plenty of decent players to go around
[1:11:23] demazLol: Rox Tigers fan for me xD
[1:11:23] madiiiman: Monte: "Arrows are the worst team to win a season of champions"
[1:11:23] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: @madiiiman Yeh rip that then lol
[1:11:37] LastArchangeI: Copium
[1:11:44] FlexGod: worst was when kta lost to najin ws in regional gauntlet
[1:11:44] xeherxan: pyosik a world champion tho Kappa
[1:11:47] madiiiman: hey monte I had pilot carrying a team sponsored by airplanes, it was perfect
[1:11:50] madiiiman: and then Teddy came along
[1:12:02] stalff: @xeherxan beryl 2x with 2 diff teams

[1:12:03] FlexGod: and then that kta team never made worlds
[1:12:07] Funew1: @montecristo Bdd, Cuzz are so good, imagine if they play together
[1:12:11] madiiiman: monte youre in an abusive relationship, its ok. the first step is admitting you had a problem
[1:12:14] Nem3an: if the lec talent pool was so shallow that g2 could single-handedly drain it by themselves that's not an indictment on them
[1:12:25] Cybeeworld: how was that ashe sup allowed to be so far up and auto....against a wall too..
[1:12:27] myst1c_cupcake: is it choosing suffering to just root for viper and rookie
[1:12:53] Funew1: This is only normal game this series
[1:13:00] RomanticCreampie: zac's sustain is nuts
[1:13:08] madiiiman: @Nem3an its not the talent pool itself being low, its that it will briefly condense into a team or two that looks like it will compete with g2, but then when they fail at the finish line, they split up and no team ever has a condensement of talent for a while again
[1:13:18] madiiiman: yes sometimes the overall talent is just low
[1:13:21] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: If rell was a g she would have just pathed straight to mid
[1:13:34] AzureCatalyst: Ooo
[1:13:37] SomeFerretGuy: fwiw I like Yeon and Apa I wanted liquid to stop overspending. My biggest problem is they didn't go far enough Core to coach and bring in Eyla/Yeon as a pair was my dream
[1:13:41] AzureCatalyst: How's it going MonteChat
[1:13:49] madiiiman: but for example. SKT is literally the reason Rox Tigers broke up. They could never beat them. it was a hurdle they failed on over and over despite appearing to be the best korean team
[1:13:59] madiiiman: g2 have done similar in the LEC to a few rosters
[1:14:10] MoldyCalzone: KEKW
[1:14:13] bigpapa421: @MonteCristo do u ever consider coaching a western teams?
[1:14:15] kshyle: eyla yeon LuL
[1:14:17] madiiiman: the first KT superteam had the same problem
[1:14:24] stalff: @SomeFerretGuy who hurt you
[1:14:33] AzureCatalyst: His dream is slightly moldy bread that has a bit of hair on it @MonteCristo
[1:14:36] orion2467: that's not a goal bro
[1:14:36] Krethas: Do you think LCS being on the live patch will have any influence on other regions, or is the gameplay level just too low for others to reference?
[1:14:38] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: Who the hell thinks Eyla of all people deserves to be someones dream
[1:14:41] orion2467: dooming na
[1:14:42] Nem3an: fnatic is really the only org this applies to
[1:14:44] SomeFerretGuy: smeb was bad too! they coudl improve
[1:14:49] Funew1: @bigpapa421 Clg happened
[1:14:49] TheBasedTaka: huffed copium
[1:14:52] MoldyCalzone: COPIUM
[1:14:56] LastArchangeI: at least Ferret is loyal
[1:15:03] chaotic_dimension: @montecristo how do you feel about first drake vs Grubbs?
[1:15:07] Nem3an: both rogue and mad had their stacked years that they managed to turn into championship wins
[1:15:10] madiiiman: you know who I miss? OQ
[1:15:15] Ikkarrow: don't disrespect Smeb
[1:15:17] AzureCatalyst: LMFAO
[1:15:21] AzureCatalyst: Eyla is hilarious to watch
[1:15:26] AzureCatalyst: You wonder what he's thinking when he moves around the map
[1:15:28] Nem3an: fnatic is the org that has continously failed to live up to expectations
[1:15:29] TheBasedTaka: does na even have a world class bot lane possibility
[1:15:32] madiiiman: @Ikkarrow smeb was one of the worst top laners in LCK history at one point
[1:15:33] AzureCatalyst: And just have to just gaze into the abyss
[1:15:42] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: @TheBasedTaka Apparently its Yeon/Eyla Kappa
[1:15:44] Funew1: @montecristo Yeon and Core are good on lane for lcs
[1:15:48] naocorrijo: honestly i dont even think smeb was bad, at least not in 2014... (but IM has bad)
[1:15:48] Haziri_: lol didnt you and thoorin just mention how people will say you guys talk about the rule and people reference outliers and vice versa
[1:15:53] Nem3an: and humanoid is the biggest culprit imo
[1:16:03] SomeFerretGuy: I'm just dreaming of us bringing another Dardoch up you can't fault me for that Dardoch was really fucking good
[1:16:15] riley_bruce_: lec playing for fun xdd
[1:16:21] AzureCatalyst: Gonna be honest G2 staying entirely together might be the lowkey best move as a western team
[1:16:22] brissings: I can never root for g2 its so boring
[1:16:44] madiiiman: @SomeFerretGuy I wanted to see Dardoch and Forgiven on the same team so Forgiven eventually just merks dardoch after an argument
[1:16:49] AzureCatalyst: Ferret needs ufcking therapy
[1:16:50] KennyvonD: did he want to put a ward down?
[1:16:57] fIuffee: You have only 150 viewers less than hotline league right now
[1:16:58] KennyvonD: still bonkers decision.
[1:17:10] SomeFerretGuy: hll has 600 viewers? why

[1:17:21] AzureCatalyst: We don't have DILF Gamer energy
[1:17:26] fIuffee: I don't think they are
[1:17:29] myst1c_cupcake: I don't get how you can root for a team that just keeps letting you down
[1:17:30] naocorrijo: @madiiiman forg1ven almost went to TL instead of piglet so there was a chance he would have played with dardoch lul
[1:17:47] riley_bruce_: I doubt there is a lot of crossover the venn diagram of this and hotline league is slimmer by the day
[1:17:47] SomeFerretGuy: that was sick
[1:17:49] KennyvonD: Sick play
[1:17:52] MissingMatter: Is that 4% American, or metric?
[1:17:57] madiiiman: my favorite players historically have been Smeb, Pyosik, Faker and the entirety of the original UOL squad
[1:18:00] SomeFerretGuy: who what monkaW
[1:18:06] nautcholibre: nice arrow
[1:18:07] rfarleydude97: 634 viewers, def that 4% increase they are talking about

[1:18:13] madiiiman: i like smeb
[1:18:16] madiiiman: but ssumday is my goat
[1:18:23] myst1c_cupcake: IWD and forg1ven on the same team that would be a treat
[1:18:26] ProdigalChicken: only degens watching monte at 5am
[1:18:30] KennyvonD: Karma is painful
[1:18:47] madiiiman: people forget forg1vengre was actually shitting on asian ADCs at worlds
[1:18:48] myst1c_cupcake: @ProdigalChicken i have work in 1 hour what else am i supposed to do
[1:18:51] brissings: Travis and Loco should do a show together
[1:19:01] madiiiman: forgiven was what people like to claim Rekkles was
[1:19:05] riley_bruce_: with how lec playoffs have been going I get so pumped for SummoningInsight
[1:19:09] Funew1: @montecristo what is Loco doing these days
[1:19:21] ProdigalChicken: @myst1c_cupcake I got 20 left o7
[1:19:23] stalff: @brissings never happen loco hates him lol
[1:19:25] madiiiman: does loco still like being abused?
[1:19:29] demazLol: if it ends up being BDS vs FNC who do you give the advantage to? @MonteCristo
[1:19:30] riley_bruce_: travis and mark should do a show together
[1:19:34] ProdigalChicken: 20min*
[1:19:37] myst1c_cupcake: @madiiiman i mean no one claimed rekkles was aggresive
[1:19:44] Adanion: watching the old content again was fun to see all the loco banter
[1:19:44] bigpapa421: locodoco is in nft's and crypto
[1:19:46] archie7497: @madiiiman the only worlds rekkles shat on Asian adcs was 2020
[1:19:46] madiiiman: @myst1c_cupcake i ment in terms of how good they were
[1:19:52] Shimmerz: will we see a return of any lord bets this year
[1:20:11] untzno: @MonteCristo any tips to elevate your cooking skills?
[1:20:18] kshyle: noah did well in teamfights later  esp game 3
[1:20:34] kshyle: ill give eu-kr ezreal a pass
[1:20:35] Adanion: You guys really just went in on him from the first episode LUL
[1:20:47] madiiiman: monte i want a stream where you watch the old vods on Fenjih youtube channel cuz its all you and Doa's greatest hits thru ogn and early LCK
[1:20:49] lazink: learning to make good sauces is HUGE for cooking
[1:20:58] untzno: oh damn didnt know that app existed... I use every other ny app besides it
[1:21:01] Adanion: Then again, Thorin roasted every single guest as the intro for every ep LUL
[1:21:02] madiiiman: your banter and the best game moments
[1:21:04] Krethas: @MonteCristo Do you think LCS being on live patch will have any value/influence on other regions in terms of future meta planning? Or is the gameplay level just too low to reference?
[1:21:15] myst1c_cupcake: @MonteCristo how do i get excited by LEC rn, like it's my region but they are all so bad and dissapointing
[1:21:27] nautcholibre: just experiment try to make one meal a week that is a challenge
[1:21:29] yo_mate69: you seem like u like jazz music. True?
[1:21:31] SomeFerretGuy: @myst1c_cupcake choose a new region

[1:22:25] myst1c_cupcake: @stalff yea, i atleast had 1 team the last couple years
[1:22:37] fIuffee: wow medic just brought up that he used to be a doctor again
[1:22:39] madiiiman: @MonteCristo this channel will give you crazy nostalgia https://www.youtube.com/c/F3nJiH
[1:22:41] fIuffee: news to me
[1:22:43] Skinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny: @madiiiman i like your thinking
[1:23:01] SomeFerretGuy: @myst1c_cupcake wanna know the secret to being a fan of mediocrity? tune in until you see if your team is trash then go do something else
[1:23:24] Nem3an: @fIuffee would you say it was not what the doctor ordered?
[1:23:29] madiiiman: look chat none of you have anything on me. im a lifelong chicaco cubs fan. i win any suffering fanbase argument
[1:23:36] madiiiman: prior to 2016 it was all we knew
[1:23:54] yo_mate69: @montecristo what do you think of chaos, and complete incoordination of most of LEC and LCS games? I feel like they're so random at most.
[1:23:58] SomeFerretGuy: were you born into the cubs or did you choose the life of suffering
[1:24:04] madiiiman: @SomeFerretGuy born into it
[1:24:12] madiiiman: but i chose to stay
[1:24:19] madiiiman: i attended games the year they lost 110 games
[1:24:31] MissingMatter: @madiiiman My local team is the Pirates. They're working on catching up to that as hard as they can.
[1:24:38] brissings: Being a fan of terrible team can be so much fun once they get good look at the lions this year
[1:25:04] ProdigalChicken: imaginary plates Kappa
[1:25:06] madiiiman: unironically if matt stafford was on the lions ewhen Dan Campbell took over the Lions have 2 rings
[1:25:09] SomeFerretGuy: should have run into the corner to waste more time at least
[1:25:22] madiiiman: btw, lions win the super bowl by 30 the other night
[1:25:33] brissings: Jared Goff isnt that bad
[1:25:35] madiiiman: if goff's recievers had hands
[1:25:47] madiiiman: @brissings goff is good, but hes not Stafford
[1:26:18] brissings: Yeah but I don't think Detroit going out close in the semis is something to scoff at they are still young and were long shots
[1:26:19] archie7497: Did you know before brokenblade picked zac in his series vs fnatic he practiced the gnar vs zac matchup vs alphari's gnar. That's why g2 banned gnar before picking zac.
[1:26:22] madiiiman: one of stafford's biggest strengths is being virtually indestructible. it requires LITERAL broken back for him to miss any games his first like 11 yers
[1:26:24] yo_mate69: I feel like it's easier to judge mistakes when they're punished, but you get real understanding of your mistakes when you see them when they go unpunished. thoughts? @montecristo
[1:26:36] myst1c_cupcake: is senna good with the lack of stacks available while farming, wouldn't it just be better to go another adc
[1:26:40] fljqpy: SK cant ever contest drake souls eh
[1:27:41] fljqpy: i guess if ISMA was so distracted by the zac blobs it was good KEKW

[1:28:18] PinnxelGRP: FNC was really terrible this series, should have lost imo
[1:28:20] bigpapa421: irrelevant should be on a top team
[1:28:22] demazLol: Monte's just like "Uhhhhh"
[1:28:23] doomerop: My region Sadge
[1:28:28] bigpapa421: idk why hes in SK jail
[1:28:28] sheald_bot: Does anyone know if Ilaoi support has ever been played on previous patches? I've been owning with it in solo Q.
[1:28:30] yo_mate69: what's the time In KR? 5am in Poland
[1:28:40] fljqpy: mid jg on SK pepeW
[1:28:50] archie7497: I can't even flame Jun cuz I don't even know if the lec ui is fucked and he doesn't have flash
[1:28:59] brissings: @madiiiman Yeah but also not counting the pics from the trade which were great
[1:29:07] fljqpy: ISMA on rell duty pepeW
[1:29:12] bigpapa421: @sheald_bot maybe because you're below diamond
[1:29:28] madiiiman: my new mission is to find the old clip where monte says the phrase "Sexual thrills of Lollipoppy"
[1:29:38] madiiiman: i will not stop until i dig it up
[1:29:44] SomeFerretGuy: rank shaming is decidely not erudite
[1:29:44] sheald_bot: @bigpapa421 True, I'm Emerald. Only been playing for a month.
[1:29:59] yo_mate69: if twitch gets banned in KR do you go full YouTube or move or what?
[1:30:15] madiiiman: @fuseib he has a vpn nothig changes
[1:30:16] MissingMatter: He doesn't care because he uses a VPN @fuseib
[1:30:25] PinnxelGRP: doesnt it time out
[1:30:29] madiiiman: monte is literally unaffected by korea twitch stuff
[1:30:36] LastArchangeI: @montecristo we need someone to break out the Senna/Cho bot again
[1:30:57] madiiiman: HOP IN HURRY
[1:31:05] madiiiman: boom
[1:31:19] fljqpy: nesquik went late
[1:31:48] archie7497: What was that humanoid flash btw
[1:31:55] PinnxelGRP: its so weird, nisqy makes some isnane plays but then he randomly ints the game away sometimes
[1:31:56] yo_mate69: @madiiiman ah true he don't stream things where ping matters. True
[1:32:18] PinnxelGRP: Irrelevant Sadge
[1:32:23] lost_t1me: why does senna complete mortal remainder instead of just  holding on executioner and building lord dom
[1:32:49] fljqpy: SK just cant never contest drakes even with rell jg eh

[1:33:22] yo_mate69: @archie7497 does alphari still play this game? u know his ***?
[1:33:33] echo_17y: how did senna end up in dragon pit 1v1 with razork, wtf
[1:33:43] Glyers: Exakick put himself into a terrible position
[1:34:17] myst1c_cupcake: @fuseib he did matchup practice with either bb or odo recently i think
[1:34:37] fljqpy: they just get 0 drakes with rell azir eh
[1:34:44] PinnxelGRP: hahahaha
[1:34:45] archie7497: @fuseib gilius said on stream that he saw bb and alphari practice in private
[1:34:45] pilotjunkie: What did you think of nisky's last tp in game 1 xdd
[1:34:50] Glyers: Its kinda crazy to me: we got an adc in eu that actually hits his spells in teamfights
[1:34:51] PinnxelGRP: monte doesnt know about game 3 PepeLaugh

[1:35:26] josefino10: i already know PepeLaught
[1:35:26] myst1c_cupcake: @Glyers i've lost hope in eu adc players, we used to have 7 good ones now we have 1.5 tops
[1:35:40] Sobyi: Here is your corki @montecristo
[1:36:13] yo_mate69: Ashe is so good Into Renata tho
[1:36:16] myst1c_cupcake: isn't ez ashe really good into draven renata
[1:36:24] Glyers: @myst1c_cupcake yeah its Sadge I hope Upset gets a good support
[1:36:51] archie7497: Aware
[1:37:00] demazLol: This is an absolute FIESTA of a game get ready @MonteCristo

[1:38:34] yo_mate69: followup with r for vi R, they can play on max range with ornn R hold for disengage. itd good
[1:38:46] Glyers: @myst1c_cupcake I doubt it would be that bad tbf :D
[1:39:01] madiiiman: monte this is really random, but do you remember what year you would have had the lollipoppy discussion on broadcast with doa? it was pre rework surely. so either 2013 or 2014
[1:39:11] fljqpy: ad tf is trash
[1:39:37] madiiiman: DAMMIT
[1:39:38] unclemiketheinformant: i miss doa
[1:39:44] madiiiman: i need the clip of you saying "sexual thrills of lollipoppy"
[1:39:47] HavoxGG: TF and or Fizz makes me miss Westdoor
[1:39:50] madiiiman: ITS THE BEST SOUNDBITE EVER
[1:39:55] fIuffee: monte do you remember what you had for lunch on the 29th of march 2014?
[1:40:09] Glyers: Doesnt ad tf have the same problems as draven here?
[1:40:11] myst1c_cupcake: draven should never cashout in lane either, unless isma and nisqy make a really good play
[1:40:36] untzno: because they already suck enough
[1:40:38] AzureCatalyst: I'm telling you the Yordhole was the most disgusting conversation I've ever heard about
[1:40:42] madiiiman: its the only poppy skin i usw
[1:40:44] AzureCatalyst: Lollipoppy was actually on sale two weeks ago
[1:40:56] Adanion: no matter how far we try to avoid it, it all comes back to the yordhole
[1:41:02] fljqpy: AP TF would bang
[1:41:04] fIuffee: lollipoppy's yordhole is unusually large
[1:41:07] fistigons25: Caedrel lost his god damn mind on this game. lmfao
[1:41:11] xonsa: flash before aggro
[1:41:18] Glyers: He wanted to buffer it, no?
[1:41:23] myst1c_cupcake: oscar was premature there
[1:41:29] yo_mate69: top is over now.
[1:41:40] echo_17y: nice try from him tbh
[1:41:49] echo_17y: could be a huge play
[1:41:54] 3moordekaiser: this series was one of the funniest matches i have ever watched
[1:41:58] fljqpy: AD TF is trash bcos AD items are trash
[1:41:59] 3moordekaiser: clown show all aroun
[1:42:14] echo_17y: wait until the real fiesta starts xdd
[1:42:14] AzureCatalyst: @Adanion Everyday we stray away from the Yordhole's light
[1:42:15] myst1c_cupcake: @MonteCristo do you think hle can make msi or worlds this year
[1:42:27] zen__cloud: @MonteCristo this game speaks to the greatness that is western league
[1:42:27] AzureCatalyst: Yo does anyone in chat have a Yordhole emote? I need to add it if you have it
[1:42:27] demazLol: Ready to get a headache @MonteCristo ?
[1:42:42] AzureCatalyst: OH GOD
[1:42:53] chickenplastic: WutFace
[1:42:54] madiiiman: yordholes are actually notoriously dark and damp
[1:42:55] fljqpy: OMEGALUL
[1:43:01] fljqpy: but a teemo
[1:43:02] LilGimli: OMEGALUL
[1:43:04] madiiiman: literally just teemo's asshole

[1:43:23] fistigons25: Monte, do we have SI later today?
[1:43:26] spucky117: poppy scream
[1:43:27] SomeFerretGuy: yes
[1:43:55] AzureCatalyst: @fljqpy I was thinking Lollipoppy with a OMEGALUL where her stomach is
[1:44:01] AzureCatalyst: So you can truly gaze into the abyss
[1:44:18] fljqpy: @AzureCatalyst bellybutton play WutFace
[1:44:46] AzureCatalyst: Why do you think that a yordhole has to between the legs? Yordles aren't mammals Their hole can be in the center of their torso monkaHmm
[1:44:55] fljqpy: ISMA NOOOO
[1:44:58] AzureCatalyst: I feel like I've gone too far
[1:45:18] Sodo_Mojo: solo bolo
[1:45:18] fIuffee: yordles are disgusting creatures
[1:45:44] demazLol: Irrelevant just ALWAYS Dumpsters Oscar every time xD
[1:45:57] AzureCatalyst: I like to imagine that some person is goign to watch the Monte FNC vs BDS review some day in the future and just hear our Yordhole conversation WHATAREWESAYING
[1:45:59] spucky117: @AzureCatalyst poppy head with the scream and mouth overtaking her whole head and casusing it to to disappear like pacman
[1:46:01] yo_mate69: Jun flashed.
[1:46:02] echo_17y: do you guys think Irrelevant is the best eu top now? he was really good last year top
[1:46:04] PinnxelGRP: I saw a lot of people shitting on Oscar for this game but is there anything Ornn can do in this situation?
[1:46:05] fljqpy: exakick got turret aggro
[1:46:08] Adanion: yordhole in the back of the head like a matrix jack in receiver
[1:46:19] yo_mate69: fuck doss*
[1:46:23] myst1c_cupcake: look overlay
[1:46:37] fljqpy: SURELY this game is over
[1:46:38] myst1c_cupcake: ok they fixed it right after
[1:46:39] thugitakhrushchev: PepeLaugh this is just the early game
[1:46:46] PinnxelGRP: wow what a fantastic start by SK
[1:46:48] PinnxelGRP: surely they win
[1:46:51] PinnxelGRP: Aware
[1:46:53] AzureCatalyst: SURELY this game is going to be cleanly snowballed SURELY
[1:46:54] Glyers: Oh so they just cleanly snowball their lead, right?
[1:46:56] demazLol: SURELY SK CANT LOSE FROM HERE
[1:47:08] echo_17y: nesquick incident incoming Aware
[1:47:18] AzureCatalyst: I fucking love the SURELY emote NGL probably my only Weeb emote of the bunch but I had to
[1:47:28] fIuffee: please remove the weeb emote
[1:47:29] nickis211: Guys I haven't seen this game and I'm getting hints that sk might int
[1:47:40] myst1c_cupcake: you have to play sidelane with a comp like this otherwise you don't have any dmg from mid adc on sk
[1:47:45] fljqpy: surely they will utilize their lead to get objectives and close out the games
[1:47:49] demazLol: SURELY SK CANT LOSE FROM HERE RIGHT?

[1:48:28] PinnxelGRP: Pour one out for Irrelevant guys
[1:48:28] AzureCatalyst: Yeah we saw it
[1:48:30] AzureCatalyst: It was fun
[1:48:37] myst1c_cupcake: don't you need rfc on draven second or third to play this game
[1:48:42] echo_17y: they sacrifice everything to not let noah fall behind
[1:48:44] spucky117: cristoRACCOON cristoRACCOON
[1:48:53] demazLol: This game is why we all said Irrelevant should be on a better team xD
[1:48:57] FumaK0tar0: irrelevant looks like one of the best top laners in the lec
[1:49:09] fIuffee: why have esports chants not evolved beyond just saying the team name over and over
[1:49:12] nickis211: Irrelevant gamed his heart out this series
[1:49:14] fljqpy: ahhh yes AD TF dps
[1:49:17] fljqpy: lovely
[1:49:23] SaltyLuigiKart8: why is isma spamming emote non stop xd
[1:49:28] myst1c_cupcake: @fljqpy ap tf doesn't kill there
[1:49:35] demazLol: SURELY SK WINS THIS
[1:49:51] fljqpy: @myst1c_cupcake yea its just TF in S14
[1:49:53] fljqpy: wcyd
[1:49:55] AzureCatalyst: SK is constantly rotating the TF out of the Corki lane its really good
[1:50:14] AzureCatalyst: Like it keeps constant pressure and keeps opening up opportunities for Nisqy to start skirmishes and picks
[1:50:20] PinnxelGRP: PepeLaugh
[1:50:24] johnfisa: Imagine they would not forget this fabulous splitpush thing...
[1:50:31] demazLol: @AzureCatalyst  and here starts the Fiesta in like 2 mins
[1:50:37] johnfisa: Looks very useful
[1:51:00] PinnxelGRP: Ok rewatching this fight wtf did Draven just do
[1:51:02] myst1c_cupcake: how did sk bot get wave crashes that much, was it just jgl pressure or shouldn't fnc bot be perma prio
[1:51:04] Glyers: Razork couldve just ulted Isma for the chain I believe
[1:51:05] AzureCatalyst: WAIT HBe didnt' get the bailout
[1:51:06] PinnxelGRP: he just turbo inted
[1:51:14] Jeffp2662: noah just walks on rumble ult
[1:51:24] demazLol: THERES NO WAY THEY LOSE FROM HERE
[1:51:24] kshyle: @Jeffp2662 renata ulted
[1:51:24] AzureCatalyst: SURELY SK just wins from here
[1:51:32] madiiiman: k monte heres ur emotes https://imgur.com/a/YvRQI5e

[1:52:04] nickis211: SURELY
[1:52:08] PinnxelGRP: its all going perfect for SK PepeLaugh
[1:52:09] demazLol: FIESTA COMMENCES
[1:52:15] Jeffp2662: @kshyle ohhh is that what drew him in?? that makes way more sense I missed that
[1:52:17] madiiiman: oh
[1:52:18] AzureCatalyst: That's just an emote of Teemo with the text "yordholes are tight"
[1:52:25] fljqpy: SURELY they gonna use their lead to get drakes
[1:52:28] AzureCatalyst: Not really usable as an emote because the text is unreadable when it's emote sized
[1:52:40] myst1c_cupcake: fnc isn't setting up before fights properly
[1:53:04] Jeffp2662: @kshyle oh yeah I totally missed that. I just thought he lost his mind
[1:53:08] AzureCatalyst: As a yordhole connosieur, we need to do better
[1:53:22] xonsa: crazy how they even got into range of renata ult with the range

[1:53:27] kshyle: @Jeffp2662  :3 Gladge
[1:53:34] madiiiman: @AzureCatalyst im working on another one
[1:53:36] AzureCatalyst: Holy christ why are there so many vowels in connoisseur
[1:53:48] SomeFerretGuy: @AzureCatalyst french
[1:53:51] AzureCatalyst: I know
[1:54:01] MoldyCalzone: NOTED
[1:54:01] fljqpy: +1 or +6 u never know
[1:54:03] AzureCatalyst: I just googled it and I knew I could blame the fucking french for that abomination of a loanword
[1:54:06] echo_17y: xdd
[1:54:10] AzureCatalyst: Shroedinger's Intmeter xdd
[1:54:12] PinnxelGRP: and sometimes he will just int into an ezreal PepeLaugh
[1:54:13] thugitakhrushchev: xdd
[1:54:14] dowiet: the inting pity meter?
[1:54:32] rfarleydude97: chat who is he talking about, had to take a dump
[1:54:37] AzureCatalyst: Nisqy
[1:54:39] fljqpy: statik isnt nerfed yet in 14.2?
[1:54:43] demazLol: Nesquick
[1:54:43] addaberry: The Nisqy equivalent exchange
[1:54:46] azaley_dayinghe: More if he has a goos move, the chance to int gets higher
[1:54:48] PinnxelGRP: Sure
[1:54:49] archie7497: So nisqy works like f0rests betting philosophy. He is eventually due a hit on inting
[1:54:49] AzureCatalyst: He's saying Nisqy has to int because he's made 3 good plays
[1:54:50] bigblue34: Going for that Nisqy crit build
[1:54:58] AzureCatalyst: So he's ready to do some fun plays Sure
[1:55:08] fljqpy: nice lead, but they never have drake setup xdd
[1:55:31] Glyers: I think TF is just a bad pick if you have to build statik for waveclear
[1:55:48] Zelgius: @bigblue34 read any patch notes lately?
[1:55:51] fljqpy: "AD TF" with statik and zeal xdd
[1:55:53] AzureCatalyst: Do you think SK did poorly to not secure drakes with their lead or are drakes just bad for them?
[1:56:07] AzureCatalyst: Bad for them because it forces them into 5 vs 5 fights instead of picks
[1:56:11] myst1c_cupcake: why are cait players going navori 3rd now?
[1:56:22] PinnxelGRP: irrelevant FeelsBadMan
[1:56:22] fljqpy: all 3 games SK didnt get anydrakes
[1:56:23] kshyle: BB took kraken and had decent waveclear no @MonteCristo
[1:56:24] xonsa: good ashe arrow
[1:56:25] echo_17y: no way they tried to dive ornn post 15 min
[1:56:40] MrHandsomeNoodle: theres no wave bro\
[1:56:45] Zelgius: @kshyle no
[1:56:54] demazLol: NO WAY THEY LOSE FROM HERE KEKW
[1:57:00] Glyers: I dont think Irrelevant is the player to backseat this series :D
[1:57:09] FumaK0tar0: sunfire
[1:57:10] PinnxelGRP: does he have bami's?
[1:57:13] AzureCatalyst: @kshyle The waveclear was pitiful from that TF build. His was more of a pick/ulti into the frontline and nuke a squishy build
[1:57:18] bigblue34: @Zelgius It was a joke about Nisqy, not TF
[1:57:19] Fissiccisst: Rell shifted and I think it bugged the visuals
[1:57:26] AzureCatalyst: BB's TF and Nisqy's TF are doing completely different things for their team
[1:57:29] Fissiccisst: cause she went 1 frame to unmounted form
[1:57:37] AzureCatalyst: Nisqy's TF is primary Initiate almost for most of the nonRell fights
[1:57:49] echo_17y: crazy that humamoid is even in gold with tf, that should never happen, no?
[1:58:00] echo_17y: humanoid*
[1:58:14] AzureCatalyst: @echo_17y He got the bot tower solo and he's proably gonna get the top tower FNC is just funnneling the gold onto him

[2:12:16] smparrish_95: was there a reason you chose “Renegades”?
[2:12:18] chickenplastic: up 6k, desperation time
[2:12:19] AzureCatalyst: @Zelgius I like Doss.
[2:12:24] bcpancakes: @zunderbunder nobody is playing tf with ap right now

[2:13:29] SomeFerretGuy: Do not bring that up its best if you just never mention that subject again

[2:13:58] sheald_bot: I wonder if he could have ended if he cancelled the TP by killing turret.
[2:13:59] AzureCatalyst: If he has Sorc elixir he probably gets both towers and gets out
[2:14:00] Zelgius: @azurecatalyst flash timers, not cleanse, anyone could've said they thought ez cleansed in the top lane fight

[2:38:25] JeeFour: @JeeFour lolalytics then, but i just suggest that one for ppl new to stat sites
[2:38:27] Zepz9565: gotta swap the title from bangers only when you watch western games lol

[2:38:39] AntiquusTonitrus_3: Good lck is back been a hard week with out lpl and lck
[2:38:45] thugitakhrushchev: PepeLaugh gotta flame Hyli
[2:38:51] Veila24: The G2 series was pretty banging yesterday, the way they dismantled BDS
[2:39:31] PinnxelGRP: i feel depressed about c9, this lcs split has been great but i wish c9 was dominant so there could be hope internationally

[2:40:03] PinnxelGRP: supa??
[2:40:06] Zebrios: Stand still, eat arrow
[2:40:07] scazor2028: @MonteCristo what place do you think G2 would be in the lck/
[2:40:30] Zebrios: 5th I think
[2:40:47] Quarthian: @PinnxelGRP The sooner you give up hope on the LCS being good internationally the better off you'll be
[2:41:04] bigpapa421: 4th is a little generous considering they lost to NRG...
[2:41:20] Veila24: They'd be 5th as they are right now, but if they had been in LCK from the start of the season and gotten to soloq in KR + scrim LCK teams, do you think they would be higher?
[2:41:28] thugitakhrushchev: @bigpapa421 that was one fucking series on g2's off day
[2:41:33] ADrugge: Just means NRG would be third. Kappa
[2:41:39] PinnxelGRP: COPIUM nrg isnt better than g2
[2:41:40] AzureCatalyst: I watched NRG lose to Shopify
[2:41:44] madiiiman: better team on the yordhole
[2:41:55] FrozenLavaReflector: They did beat d+ that same tournament, the weibo game was more iffy
[2:41:55] Zebrios: I still feel like Mad Lions Koi missed a branding opportunity with their prefix.  They could've been MLK, named their academy team MLK Jr and made their slogan "we have a dream"
[2:42:02] bigpapa421: @bigpapa421 its a bo3 bro, not like its a bo1 cheese
[2:42:09] bigpapa421: i dont buy the excuses honestly
[2:42:16] ProdigalChicken: will nrg even face g2 this year?
[2:42:28] AzureCatalyst: But they couldn't beat the NA GIGACHAD NRG
[2:42:30] Veila24: @ProdigalChicken Nah dawg they're hot garbage right now
[2:42:36] AzureCatalyst: STOPPED BY BIG DHOKES AND PALAFAKER
[2:42:37] Ligs4prez: Would a performing G2, beat NRG at that level?
[2:43:11] BeezyLAN: yes
[2:43:11] AzureCatalyst: I'm not forgetting them
[2:43:16] BeezyLAN: i made it in time for the hyli game!!!
[2:43:16] ProdigalChicken: @Veila24 Deadge
[2:43:16] bigpapa421: Obviously i think G2 is better assuming that scrim winrate wasnt a lie
[2:43:23] archie7497: Btw how dumb was the azir ban by vitality in the second round of bans and leaving up taliyah. Akali already soft counters azir while taliyah actually counters akali. How unplayable if akali in this game vs vi taliyah and tf ult
[2:43:24] AzureCatalyst: I remember watching CLG lose to IMT and then beating TSM at Anaheim
[2:43:25] JeeFour: are we actually wondering if G2 is worse than NRG??? yall be trolling
[2:43:31] AzureCatalyst: Because that's the CLG I know and love
[2:43:34] sakuragui17: g2 lost against Rogue they just have this happy days
[2:43:35] kerokerogrips: NRG losing to immortals last split kekw
[2:43:45] Zebrios: Hearing NA and EU arguing over who is better is like watching fans of 8th and 10th place LCK argue over which of them is gonna win the LCK title.
[2:43:47] FrozenLavaReflector: 0-4 vs weibo
[2:43:51] Veila24: @JeeFour NA wins once and they think themselves world champs bro
[2:43:51] PinnxelGRP: MAD was harder for NRG than G2 OMEGALUL G2 frauds
[2:43:52] BeezyLAN: Does Hyli beat the wintrading allegations @MonteCristo
[2:43:55] Le_Phoenix_WinQ: Ngl didnt watch a single other nrg game than against g2 🔥
[2:44:01] AzureCatalyst: @Le_Phoenix_WinQ Good
[2:44:03] eatluxury: yeah but it's funny to torment G2 fans with that series
[2:44:09] AzureCatalyst: Keep your memories intact and beautiful @Le_Phoenix_WinQ

[2:45:50] direpants2: that's just hyli being hyli
[2:46:06] PinnxelGRP: btw VTO was very passive agressive this series, everytime Hyli died on his own he would just do the thumbs up emote PepeLaugh
[2:46:11] Zebrios: Let's dive Tier 2 turret with no vision and no TP advantage.  Surely nothing could go wrong.
[2:46:53] myosotismenot: vto ready to play with stend ig
[2:46:54] JeeFour: is fist bump disabled in pro play?

[2:48:16] Archique: kim chi quesadilla so good
[2:48:17] PinnxelGRP: apparently the superbowl had 132 million viewers which shattered the previous record. Taylor Swift's following is insane
[2:48:18] gravitum_uwu: guess how many deaths he ended on

[2:50:54] Veila24: @MonteCristo what country in Europe would you say has produced the best lol talent, or maybe even esports as a whole
[2:51:00] Zoht_: Alvaro has been really good too
[2:51:00] Imaslapyou: Don't kill our sense of being young yet LUL
[2:51:01] heckintim: yeah chat just because monte can be 50 and look 20 doesnt mean he isnt xD Kappa
[2:51:02] Veila24: like as a whole
[2:51:09] mjoll_the_hotness: monte looks great for 45 also
[2:51:15] PinnxelGRP: hes 45 and 3 months not exactly 45...
[2:51:16] Zebrios: Usher had all those 30-something moms up dancing and embarrassing their kids.
[2:51:17] Disciple_oc: damn imagine not having Usher's age memorized
[2:51:17] Stozypokes: In Monte's defense, Ushers first album was released in 1993, so it's only fair to assume that he should be at least 50
[2:51:39] Zebrios: To be fair, Monte stopped aging in 2014
[2:51:43] Eidelweiss: black don't crack.....
[2:51:55] Ichigeki1: @Stozypokes he was like 16 or something for his first album lol
[2:52:06] Serberen: akali is awful against mad draft t
[2:52:08] SomeFerretGuy: the members of aqua are 50 years old or more Oldge

[2:52:18] mjoll_the_hotness: we old
[2:52:26] Eidelweiss: Designed by DZK
[2:52:26] SomeFerretGuy: tupac would also be in his 50s

[2:52:40] Disciple_oc: @PinnxelGRP he was stunned by taliyah e
[2:52:43] Its_Just_Andy: @PinnxelGRP he ulted through the taliyah E so he was stunned
[2:52:47] lucashowmuchpain: yeah but we ban azir :)
[2:52:51] PinnxelGRP: oh ok
[2:52:59] Stozypokes: Why is HIlly still a pro player?
[2:53:01] AzureCatalyst: Probably because no Sorc boots?
[2:53:05] Zebrios: Trying to pop sett?
[2:53:18] Zebrios: IDK
[2:53:21] AzureCatalyst: You want early Blighting because he went CDR boots and they have Merc treads I guess
[2:53:29] Violet_Katt: the Spanish fans chanting Hylisang is hilarious
[2:53:40] FindingMeme0: @Stozypokes The west struggles to develop non midlaners
[2:53:50] AzureCatalyst: I dunno but that's the best idea I got
[2:53:55] PinnxelGRP: hes trying to rush the penetration healing item because he knows hyli will int so he procs the heal instantly every fight
[2:54:12] cryow1zard: why in pro play do mages always rush magic pen
[2:54:13] AzureCatalyst: Also it might be the Cryptobloom item so it might just be so that they can get the heal on VI when they instantly murder one person with the full combo
[2:54:17] hejhopp_: Hyli??????????????? o.0
[2:54:37] Serberen: cryptobloom is just a good item, and theres mr on enemy to easily justify it

[3:05:16] globtroter: It's a bit sad to see only G2 at the highest level again. BDS FNC has also shown in recent games that it has a lot of problems. This winter split shows that EU is doing poorly in international competitions again this year... Sadge
[3:05:17] Sniper13x: is it a matter of "oh crap we agreed to a contract with this guy so i guess we have to play him"
[3:05:19] madiiiman: damn

[3:06:43] thugitakhrushchev: Dom said it best earlier today, Mad are 5th have good coordination, teams below 5th have no coordination.
[3:06:56] AzureCatalyst: The flanking Taliyah is disgusting
[3:06:58] Stozypokes: Cryptobloom value

[3:09:45] Violet_Katt: casual 11 bomb by Hyli

[3:11:13] thugitakhrushchev: I wonder what is VIT's VOD Reviews like after a game like this.
[3:11:13] sheald_bot: Given that soloQ win-rates prob won't skyrocket on Taliyah, she'll stay super strong for awhile
[3:12:15] sheald_bot: Hyli gonna point out one play and be like, "Yeah, if we did this here my Sett would have snowballed"
[3:12:20] isJolTz: Oi idk about the vit comp

[3:16:12] eklyps_lol: @montecristo do you think that vitality would look better with selfmade instead of daglas ?
[3:16:53] myosotismenot: great early game, how can they throw this Sure
[3:17:08] sheald_bot: myrwn still lvl 1 at 3min lol
[3:17:18] AzureCatalyst: Alvaro goes so deep for wards jesus
[3:17:33] AzureCatalyst: Like he's gone from botlane for like 15 seconds for that deep ward on the gromp
[3:17:36] Zebrios: @MonteCristo With Hyli in the game, he always has at least 1 overextended lane.
[3:18:10] eklyps_lol: imagine vitality with selfmade and trymbi instead of daglas and hily
[3:18:16] realbeeef: Which league looks better lcs or lec?

[3:20:47] HjorthScrublord: I think the only way he could win that is to save flash to dodge Q
[3:20:54] AzureCatalyst: I don't think this is a good play unless he bursts enough to kill him with the flash imo
[3:21:04] JeeFour: what a stone cold killer. no heal used
[3:21:07] sheald_bot: @MonteCristo Idk how 100T get away with it; teams just give em the junk fights they need
[3:21:22] mjoll_the_hotness: dunno if hes confident or just forgot to push things
[3:21:22] AzureCatalyst: He didn't even use his 2 cookies
[3:21:41] AzureCatalyst: Supa is legit ice cold
[3:21:54] AzureCatalyst: WAIT
[3:21:58] AzureCatalyst: HE HAD HAIL OF BLADES DOWN TOO
[3:22:07] Ligs4prez: he had heal left
[3:22:08] AzureCatalyst: Holy fuck that's varus without HOB winning that trade

[3:26:41] Aoyos_: It wasn't a knockback on the swing, he just body blocked it
[3:26:43] AzureCatalyst: Ah it's not done processing
[3:26:45] Zebrios: Myrwyn has been really mechanically impressive.  I think he's got a future in LEC
[3:26:50] Aoyos_: He used knockback before the swing

[3:28:15] archie7497: Why did photon reveal himself idk. Don't you hide waiting for mad to engage thinking it's a 4v4
[3:28:40] mickzerofive: wtf is that emote

[3:29:19] mickzerofive: mine needed a capital Y
[3:29:26] AzureCatalyst: Can anyone else see Poppy and  Yordhole
[3:29:30] SomeFerretGuy: yep
[3:29:34] mickzerofive: yes i can see them both
[3:29:34] mjoll_the_hotness: i can see just fine
[3:29:35] TrendNation69: what is mads comp
[3:29:39] AzureCatalyst: Weird I've been refreshing and I can't see it
[3:29:44] AzureCatalyst: So I guess you guys get the cursed emotes
[3:29:48] mjoll_the_hotness: 7tv is a buggy mess
[3:29:53] Zelgius: Daglas makes my eyes bleed man
[3:30:07] xMungaM: the TP is huge here
[3:30:09] AzureCatalyst: @Zelgius Look into the Poppy instead

[3:31:16] AzureCatalyst: Alright
[3:31:23] AzureCatalyst: That's enough experimenting with Yordhole for tonight
[3:31:37] AzureCatalyst: cristoYORD
[3:32:03] AzureCatalyst: If you're SUPA suprised I'm Carzzy surprised PepeLaugh
[3:32:11] archie7497: Monte you don't know
[3:32:20] AzureCatalyst: SURELY
[3:32:36] mjoll_the_hotness: vetheo is gonna perkz from 2018 vs rng right
[3:32:45] FiveGorillazTTv: I just finished the fnc-sk vod, now I feel so bad for irrelevant
[3:32:45] AzureCatalyst: SURELY they win this
[3:32:51] myosotismenot: Sure
[3:32:54] mjoll_the_hotness: or can this lb build do the same stuff
[3:33:03] madiiiman: cristoYORD
[3:33:07] AzureCatalyst: Poppy
[3:33:12] hejhopp_: AzureCatalyst Hyli might have other plans Kappa
[3:33:20] Aoyos_: Akshan shouldn't allow Varus to do anything with the lead
[3:33:25] AzureCatalyst: @hejhopp_ Hyli is never beating the wintrading allegations
[3:33:28] IgonnaBe3: what do you think @MonteCristo about ad vs ap LB ? personally i am kind of an AD LB hater because the lack of CDR and mana makes it a bit meh to play. Sure it can split push well but split pushing is sorta dead and it doesnt have the same kill pressure as AP LB
[3:33:34] PlzN0: @AzureCatalyst that is one cursed emote lol
[3:33:48] AzureCatalyst: @PlzN0 Thanks I tried my best
[3:33:49] sheald_bot: And Kai'Sa is far behind; she can't do anything
[3:34:31] brandofan2: i dont like the picking rell into brand
[3:34:42] AzureCatalyst: EWWW Kaisa is going eclipse
[3:34:45] AzureCatalyst: I HATE IT
[3:34:53] AzureCatalyst: i THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO GO SHOJINS
[3:35:02] meIIerr: do you ? they don't have a front line, like it would fine going ad leblanc here
[3:35:14] ASquishyLiquid: and u like shojins kaisa?
[3:35:32] AzureCatalyst: Well I saw the Caulfields and was like she doesn't have a tear so the only item I like here is Shojins or Navori
[3:35:44] AzureCatalyst: The eclipse is not my idea first item Kaisa build
[3:35:48] TrendNation69: if they have no frontline then ap lb is even better
[3:35:54] AzureCatalyst: Especially when you have jayce and varus already for AD Damage

[3:36:28] mjoll_the_hotness: i would be pooping my pants when there is 4 kill lb on the rift
[3:36:32] AzureCatalyst: Like this build probably has zero Kai'sa evolves til like 3 items?
[3:36:55] pesukarhupoju: it has q evolve at eclipse finish no?
[3:37:09] meIIerr: like g2 vs Bds ?
[3:37:11] Imaslapyou: Kappa
[3:37:13] AzureCatalyst: Eclipse is 70 attack damage
[3:37:21] AzureCatalyst: Dorans and Longsword are needed
[3:37:29] meIIerr: he has a long sword and doran for the 100 ad
[3:37:43] pesukarhupoju: yeah are we saying dorans + longsword + eclipse is 3 items?
[3:38:04] meIIerr: you should speak in term of gold value tho, not in terme of items
[3:38:07] AzureCatalyst: Well that longsword is gonna sit in his inventory til the nashors is done
[3:38:19] IgonnaBe3: this split just made me sad. The perkz vs caps conversation is dead, the hylissang vs mikyx convo is also dead, my goats are washed, this spanish nationalism team is somehow top4, french fans are delusional as well ehhhhh
[3:38:22] meIIerr: man hylli inted so hard here
[3:38:25] meIIerr: no idea what was the plan
[3:38:36] TrendNation69: start holding hyli accountable lll
[3:38:38] Aoyos_: But hyli wants to fight
[3:38:41] mjoll_the_hotness: wait what was the idea here
[3:38:44] brandofan2: hyli free agent speedrun
[3:38:46] AzureCatalyst: Hyli wanted to fight man
[3:39:06] thugitakhrushchev: No Monte, HYLI needed to engage to flip the game.
[3:39:20] AzureCatalyst: PepeLaugh
[3:39:24] TrendNation69: facecheck full poke comp
[3:39:34] mjoll_the_hotness: house of cards collapsing
[3:39:41] Aoyos_: Double assassin theme comp, play as if they had no assassins at all
[3:39:42] meIIerr: daglas was disgusting tbh
[3:39:45] IgonnaBe3: hylissang just runs down every fcking game man, i get that he has his own view of the game but this has to stop
[3:39:47] Zelgius: Daglas engage pepelaugh
[3:39:53] Orlouges: Orlouges subscribed with Prime. 
[3:40:01] meIIerr: why don't he flash r
[3:40:02] meIIerr: w q
[3:40:09] AzureCatalyst: He also missed his q flash so he loses his ability to q smite the baron
[3:40:16] AzureCatalyst: The missed q flash is depression
[3:40:41] AzureCatalyst: Does the brand passive take the baron?
[3:40:42] Aoyos_: He got it off burn seems like
[3:40:46] brian_lukeshaw: Thoughts on hylli making the same mistakes and not learning for 5+ years of his career? He gets caught a few times per game and often does such questionable engages
[3:40:55] meIIerr: r flash no ?
[3:40:55] Moobot: Watch Monte's VOD reviews on-demand on the Bangers Only YouTube channel! - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcnI5WRH2gvSLFiMsERufVw/
[3:40:59] meIIerr: get three
[3:41:22] Aoyos_: When it works it's goat
[3:41:25] Zelgius: Hyli made one real mistake this game
[3:41:26] nautcholibre: he makes plays
[3:41:31] mephisto5faust: hes been inting for 2 years now
[3:41:51] hotblew1337: Hyli inting because he newly married/ engaged debuff by famioly life
[3:41:54] meIIerr: but him getting caught lost them the game
[3:41:55] hotblew1337: ^/s
[3:41:56] myosotismenot: get ready SURELY
[3:42:05] kerokerogrips: nah the future is now, get this dirty inter off my screen
[3:42:10] meIIerr: which is like super often this split
[3:42:11] Zelgius: @mellerr no it didn't
[3:42:23] meIIerr: wdym it didn't ? they lost out of that
[3:42:25] mephisto5faust: hyli doesnt have upside anymore
[3:42:33] IgonnaBe3: in these couple last years, its been a lot of more bad than good
[3:42:47] Chrisssan: hasn't hylissang been always high risk engage player?
[3:42:51] TrendNation69: can he not be a good supp without these bad engages
[3:42:57] nautcholibre: yes he has.
[3:42:57] Aoyos_: @Chrisssan And always will be
[3:42:59] AzureCatalyst: Wait did he sell the Longsword on Kaisa to compelte the nashor
[3:43:05] AzureCatalyst: I hate this so much
[3:43:18] AzureCatalyst: I hate this kaisa build even if it's mathematically correct
[3:43:21] Zelgius: @meiierr hyli dying there doesn't mind control the rest of vit to also make mistakes lol
[3:43:26] IgonnaBe3: also, the bad was acceptable i think because the good was so overwhelmingly good that no other player could replicate his balls to the walls plays but nowadays i have not seen hyli do such a thing, when he is good is just decent, he is no longer this transcendental player he was before
[3:43:53] Galactic_Amaru: Galactic_Amaru subscribed with Prime. 
[3:44:08] AzureCatalyst: Welcome to the cristoYORD Yordhole Galactic
[3:44:18] meIIerr: @Zelgius you realise him dying, give free control to the enemy team in the river, by having no vision in there they feel compelled to go in, while there is absolutely no front line agains't a poke comp ? that's death sentence. Also this comp of mad is good at picking up
[3:44:33] brian_lukeshaw: I think he lacks alot of awareness to think enemies can be in a certain place for example and dying
[3:44:34] AzureCatalyst: He has enough AD for the passive upgrade yeah
[3:45:02] Zelgius: @meiierr "feel compelled" lmao, they literally have nobody to tank baron, Hyli dying does nothing
[3:45:29] nimroddaarkhon: akshan is just bad, revive gimmick but garbage aside from that
[3:45:30] AzureCatalyst: I just hate eclipse if you're goign to commit to the AP kaisa IMO but Maybe I'm not valuing the Q upgrade early as much as others are
[3:45:31] Zelgius: They can never do baron 5v4
[3:45:34] meIIerr: @Zelgius dude please hahahaa you say stupid stuff now
[3:45:48] mjoll_the_hotness: lag on lan
[3:46:02] meIIerr: @AzureCatalyst it's a good power spike to clear wave; as mid it's important

[3:46:30] AzureCatalyst: Yordhole
[3:46:39] AzureCatalyst: Blastcones something?
[3:46:49] Violet_Katt: he was directly on the edge of it maybe that was it
[3:46:51] MedicCasts: Basically if you auto at the outer range of the blast cone against a wall, you can get vertically knocked up
[3:46:52] subway_surfer69: has to do with rakan is think
[3:46:57] MedicCasts: instead of backwards
[3:47:00] Paco_GD: Im arriving to the stream and though I was lagging lol
[3:47:07] Paco_GD: Good night folks

[3:48:32] meIIerr: that was
[3:48:33] meIIerr: hahahahaha
[3:48:45] madiiiman: @MedicCasts azure made me make the poppy one
[3:48:48] madiiiman: lol
[3:48:48] DatBoiTommy: yhtsi
[3:48:50] meIIerr: respect the attempt tho but I don't see what messing his tempo would do here
[3:48:52] AzureCatalyst: Poppy this is my masterpiece
[3:48:55] madiiiman: and  teemo fisting someone
[3:49:00] Jiruuh: What do you think about MDK playstyle? They seem so aggresive, like an LPL team
[3:49:01] madiiiman: Yordhole
[3:49:02] AzureCatalyst: Now we can spam it when Peanut plays Poppy
[3:49:21] meIIerr: what's the plan for hyllu
[3:49:22] Zelgius: Rell doesn't need flash, not an engage champ when daglas plays it
[3:49:27] meIIerr: not going in the river
[3:49:47] cryowizzzard: how many times do we got to tell you old man
[3:49:56] lost_t1me: what s the point of that and why doesnt he just w the wall
[3:50:03] DatBoiTommy: Domain Expansion: Infinite INT
[3:50:12] meIIerr: I think they wanted to have some control on the bot side to protect the shadow split bot
[3:50:24] AzureCatalyst: Well
[3:50:29] AzureCatalyst: You can watch them attempt to splitpush
[3:50:42] AzureCatalyst: It's going to be a depression ending game FYI Monte
[3:50:52] AzureCatalyst: I remember seeing the last 2 minutes of this game
[3:50:56] madiiiman: wait they approved my teemo fisting someone in the ass emote? wtf?
[3:50:59] AzureCatalyst: Aware
[3:51:06] AzureCatalyst: @madiiiman 7TV is wild man

[3:51:21] meIIerr: nice reaction from hylli
[3:51:40] Chrisssan: Elyoya, press R and win lol
[3:51:52] madiiiman: Poppy will haunt my nightmares
[3:51:52] cryowizzzard: it’s actually crazy that Jayce has the cs lead now
[3:51:53] meIIerr: sad fact from his flash daglas can't do anything now
[3:52:05] AzureCatalyst: Also 7TV gets like hundreds of emote submissions a day so they don't usually get to all the submissions so sometimes you can just get some emotes through in the approval process
[3:52:29] Jiruuh: MDK here forces Akshan tp and the have more pressure on sides
[3:52:32] GoodKarma782: @majesticcchim Depending on your definition of banger, fnc sk was pretty entertaining
[3:52:36] DatBoiTommy: Man team comps this year have been real diverse so far, gotta give it to Riot
[3:52:59] meIIerr: now how do vit will stop mad sieging
[3:53:06] meIIerr: if they don't it's doomed

[3:54:16] AzureCatalyst: T2 for Nexus trade EZ Clap
[3:54:22] meIIerr: hhahahahaha
[3:54:26] Aoyos_: Photon's recall was almost over and stopped it to push
[3:54:39] Zelgius: 5/0 LB with teleport SeemsGood
[3:54:41] madiiiman: least dumb way a game is lost this series
[3:54:53] majesticcchim: @MonteCristo what should've VIT done?
[3:55:02] JeeFour: BANGERS ONLY 4Head
[3:55:22] meIIerr: vit just didnt realise by taking bot inhib, mad had to pressure through bot, they could have tried to get them during the build up
[3:55:23] Adanion: Cant wait for BerylGOAT to teach FraudGENG a lesson tomorrow RainbowPls
[3:55:26] madiiiman: @AzureCatalyst you are going to scare away all the new viewers
[3:55:26] Ahikoo: The focus on this series will be on Hyli ofcourse, but the macro was more than questionable by Vit at many points during these games
[3:55:28] thugitakhrushchev: I mean we been banging on hyli, BUT VIT also played this series really bad.
[3:55:30] Kodord: lck starting back up soon?
[3:55:31] Aoyos_: @majesticcchim In that last push you have Photon back, if you get a single revive off Akshan you turn that defense.
[3:55:40] AzureCatalyst: @madiiiman Poppy gaze into the abyss
[3:55:44] madiiiman: monte show the Yordhole and Poppy for those without 7tv XD
[3:55:53] Adanion: BerylGOAT emote needed
[3:55:56] Zelgius: Hyli made one mistake in game 2, but successfully distracted everyone from VITs awful topside
[3:55:58] AzureCatalyst: I'll add it
[3:56:34] AzureCatalyst: I don't see a BerylGOAT emote on 7TV
