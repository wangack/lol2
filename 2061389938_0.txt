[1:40:21] zzz_iton: did it cancel his knock up

[2:42:06] voidmoons: i am

[2:43:11] bladetrinity16: @Grisen lulu
[2:43:23] DudeBroMaximus: True though, Rek is underground but Taliyah breaks up the ground Scared
[2:43:35] shinyclodsire: @Grisen either milio or yummi rn i think
[2:43:48] Grisen: yea I would argue Lulu is still the best here (with Zeri) Yuumi for scaling and TF, but Lulu offers more in lane when it comes to wave management
[2:44:04] softlysupports: pro players ruining the lulu fun elisGrumpy
[2:44:12] bladetrinity16: i dont think zeri benefits much from milio since all her damage comes from q
[2:44:17] bladetrinity16: and it doesnt increase range on that
[2:44:23] Lazynameross: BIG TRIST
[2:44:24] BaneBladeV: renata is zeri's best duo in stats
[2:44:35] bladetrinity16: @banebladeuwu i can see this one too, lets zeri go ham
[2:44:36] MissJenella: that's your adc

[2:45:56] DudeBroMaximus: Idk what it is
[2:46:08] bladetrinity16: @bladetrinity16 stunt would need to confirm this but im pretty sure it doesnt cause its a spell and has less range than her autos
[2:46:41] Deku_Dreaming: @bladetrinity16 Nah I just checked, zeri q benefits from all bonus range modifiers including lethal tempo max stacks, rfc and milio campfire
[2:46:52] Deku_Dreaming: Sorry not to sound like umm ackshually Nerdge
[2:46:53] bladetrinity16: @bladetrinity16 ohhh okay mb D: milio would be okay then

[2:47:33] BaneBladeV: bladetrinity16 zeri Q is also approximately annie autoattack range which is a lot higher than her base range
[2:47:44] softlysupports: wasting those planties DuckSadge
[2:48:11] Deku_Dreaming: @bladetrinity16 It's the same for smolder q, benefits from bonus range hehe

[3:17:11] lugubrieuzz: yea bounties don't seem to work the way riot has said they're supposed to work
[3:17:29] reformedJay: doesn't it just depend on how much gold you are worth vs enemy?
[3:17:34] BaneBladeV: there are also farm bounties
[3:17:46] BaneBladeV: (obviously not applicable to support)
[3:17:55] lugubrieuzz: it's supposed to be for farm advantage, team gold advantage, and kill streaks afaik
[3:18:02] lugubrieuzz: is how it starts calculating if ur worth a bounty or not
[3:18:21] pIasmate: seen a 450 bounty for 0/0/0 because of a 100~ cs lead
[3:18:24] lugubrieuzz: but i've seen people go even in lane in cs, 0/0/0, and be behind in team gold, and get 150g bounties
[3:18:33] BaneBladeV: yeah. you can see it shift up or down in real time to adjust for team gold
[3:18:39] BaneBladeV: if a team wins a fight
[3:18:47] Ikancast: especially if you and galio position in different areas
[3:18:51] lugubrieuzz: i don't like moonstone espec on janner

[3:55:07] Lazynameross: there are supportive jgs tho
[3:55:09] rebornshim: same thing
[3:55:20] OmegaMonsoon: are we talking about facebook reels
[3:55:21] bladetrinity16: also im pretty sure if you watched Oner at worlds he was playing her jungle
[3:55:28] ThomasTheTwink: Rell is ap hecarim and thus a jungler Kappa
[3:55:32] bladetrinity16: @OmegaMonsoon fishing reels
[3:55:46] rebornshim: rell*
[3:56:00] BaneBladeV: rell was a jungler 6 patches ago or something
[3:56:01] OmegaMonsoon: @bladetrinity16 i grew up with a rod in me hands PantsGrab
[3:56:06] softlysupports: blanketJam
[3:56:08] bladetrinity16: oh my god

[3:56:32] rebornshim: @thomasthetwink or both is fine
[3:56:53] bladetrinity16: @banebladeuwu 13.13 was when they buffed her jungle
[3:57:05] ThomasTheTwink: I do not see Rell in my games unless I play her support lol
[3:57:05] bladetrinity16: so like 14 patches ago...
[3:57:15] BaneBladeV: yeah but after a certain point it fell off

[3:58:13] sumthingsup: was e max ever a thing?
[3:58:13] bladetrinity16: i think shes always gonna be a decent jungler in pro play cause they are more co-ordinated
[3:58:30] Thommenius: Rell just doesn't have the fun fast action you would expect from a knight, out of competitive champs need some fun
[3:58:34] BaneBladeV: it's also in pro because it's low econ
[3:58:48] blubbubb: ^
[3:58:51] DudeBroMaximus: You think knights were fast?
[3:58:59] pIasmate: pro play is never about fun
[3:59:05] pIasmate: it's about playing safe
[3:59:10] pIasmate: and being boring
[3:59:12] lugubrieuzz: i think her knight theme in her gameplay is pretty good
[3:59:12] rebornshim: Stunt do u like rell as a support or jg more‚Äô on your team

[4:32:38] zzz_iton: yes
[4:32:39] shadowkek__: yes it's really ugh
[4:32:40] pIasmate: IQ range is like 95-115, anything higher and they reject

[4:34:04] BaneBladeV: it'd be funny
[4:34:07] denunciator: it comes back to the question of how you prove the success of a negative. in this case, is enforcement successful if you arrest more or fewer people?
[4:34:08] gremlin_noise: in my country police is underpay so there is corruption, especiali on roads (its smth like the worst police unit for all newbies)

[4:57:24] pIasmate: cleanse is so underrated
[4:57:31] OmegaMonsoon: i would think a capture card could handle it
[4:57:51] pIasmate: most adcs just taking heal
[4:57:54] pIasmate: is bad
[4:58:09] Lazynameross: i thought ghost most taken nowadays
[4:58:18] pIasmate: heal is by far the most common
[4:58:21] Aijune: @pIasmate adcs couldn't even take the right resistance runes and you want them to take the right summoner spell keking

[5:06:30] Huassassin: wow
[5:06:39] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[5:06:46] pIasmate: lower W cd = more shield and more chances to hit E
[5:06:54] valentonta22: Wtf was that hook
[5:07:06] pIasmate: since you have max E first, W has more value than max q
[5:07:10] denunciator: interesting, stats suggest QWE is better than QEW, but EQW is better than both
[5:07:20] DudeBroMaximus: Visually the hook looked miles from landing. Kinda harsh on Ez
[5:07:23] vrgambit: This game is rough
[5:07:35] Lazynameross: am i too sleepy
[5:07:42] Lazynameross: i thought hook prediction
[5:07:43] denunciator: I suspect it's because people who max E first are more confident or hitting their Es, and so go Q for more damage. very interesting
[5:07:47] Lazynameross: ez ed into it
[5:07:49] pIasmate: IMO if you don't max Q first, then W second is way better
[5:07:54] ChromaKhroma: yea he e'd into it
[5:08:12] DudeBroMaximus: Oh
[5:08:29] DudeBroMaximus: Then yeah this Blitz is a genius
[5:08:32] denunciator: EWQ has a lower pickrate and winrate than EQW though... hmmmm
[5:08:52] pIasmate: max W seconds = more survivability
[5:08:57] pIasmate: and easier to land E
[5:09:06] denunciator: I wonder if it's because E max gives you more mpen, so Q is better
[5:09:11] denunciator: tink
[5:09:37] BaneBladeV: that's true
[5:09:40] Kazazel: I've played a lot of Rumble support and I used to put 2 points into the W, but since they nerfed the crap out of the base values, it's just not worth it anymore
[5:09:58] BaneBladeV: Pog a rumble support player to enlighten us
[5:10:14] pIasmate: W max second still lowers CD no?
[5:10:38] Kazazel: W is static CD
[5:10:41] Lazynameross: owojam
[5:10:52] softlysupports: ankhaPls
[5:10:55] BaneBladeV: if you don't have winrates, or pros, or anything, "just trust me bro" isn't good enough
[5:11:05] pIasmate: ah, W ranks only increase shield, not lower CD anymore?
[5:11:09] denunciator: pros KEKW
[5:11:16] CheezyNacho1: not pinging enemy wards NOOOO
[5:11:20] denunciator: nope it's 6s flat
[5:11:35] pIasmate: that's a shame
[5:11:39] Kazazel: you do get more movespeed with points in W but it's not worth over maxing Q imo. I find a good Q with Zhonya's bait can turn a fight
[5:11:44] denunciator: people who max Q first perform better with W 2nd tho because moveapeed scales with lvl
[5:11:59] denunciator: so I think E max is Q 2nd, Q max is W 2nd
[5:12:05] denunciator: and that sort of makes sense
[5:12:12] jannablowsu: zac kinda trolled you there
[5:12:19] goose__bag: perfect ult
[5:12:27] Lazynameross: did
[5:12:27] Kazazel: Q max feels useless in lane unless you know you can kill or heavily win repeated trades
[5:12:30] Lazynameross: illaoi f too?
[5:12:34] ChromaKhroma: EZREAL PLEASE
[5:12:51] ChromaKhroma: bye ezreal
[5:13:02] jannablowsu: this blitz is cracked
[5:13:11] ZoeGirl: ChromaKhroma erickdHello
[5:13:15] BaneBladeV: so it's always E-Q for lane poke and shred later. we're Learning
[5:13:19] ChromaKhroma: zoegirl quantSquish
[5:13:52] Kazazel: that's what I do, but I think if you're going some kind of kill lane, or are able to go melee mode often, Q max could be ok
[5:13:59] pIasmate: stunt, can we see illaoi again as sup after the new change?
[5:14:10] ChromaKhroma: i could see it into a lane with a melee adc (nilah, yasuo, etc)
[5:14:38] zzz_iton: close
[5:15:49] pIasmate: slows are so underrated, until you consider how valuable ms is
[5:16:28] pIasmate: support rumble can use ult to zone, to keep enemies out of certain places like in front of your adc
[5:16:37] Lazynameross: ono

[5:18:07] Lazynameross: minion block to this degree has happened even in pro games hehe
[5:18:16] ChromaKhroma: you know what they should have done with infernal map? it should turn the river into lava and you take damage per second when ur in it

[5:25:30] BaneBladeV: kaenic rookern is still absurdly strong. you could probably get away with it on Janna

[5:28:49] Vaaarangian: You sound like MMO people trying to find patterns in the RNG
[5:29:03] BaneBladeV: loserq = giving up in champ select. you don't do that
[5:29:05] Skever_: imagine if you only played a few games a week, you could have like a month of agony from RNG
[5:29:05] ledoz: call it people are horrible humans sometimes queue
[5:29:18] pIasmate: loser q is just superstition
[5:29:26] „Ç´„É¢„É°6: if you queue up for ranked solo you are in losers queue by definition :tf:
[5:29:38] ChromaKhroma: i mean you could average streak length and compare to what it would be for completely random
[5:29:52] pIasmate: fact is like 95% of lol players are just bad
[5:30:01] pIasmate: so you have a higher chance of having bad team mates
[5:30:17] Skever_: @pIasmate the top 5% aint any better
[5:30:23] savvy_with_it: What was the backend bit regarding side selection?
[5:30:27] pIasmate: top 5% are better on average
[5:30:32] Kinkou_Order: @ChromaKhroma but that doesnt account for whether or not stunt does better after a win or worse after a lose
[5:30:42] pIasmate: and diamond is top 5% :P
[5:30:42] hernsi: LMAO
[5:30:45] Lazynameross: ono
[5:30:48] ChromaKhroma: yea you would have to think about tilt queueing etc
[5:31:25] savvy_with_it: Do you think the matchmaking backend has been updated with s14?
[5:31:31] Skever_: @pIasmate ye till you get 4 shared accounts on your team and then derank player is on it then enemy team same account they have the booster playing
[5:31:43] Skever_: happend to me
[5:31:46] Skever_: not 4 but still
[5:31:56] pIasmate: hey I said on average, sometimes you can get 10 heads in a row on a coin flip
[5:31:58] eggrinny: stunt on an intended support :o
[5:32:15] pIasmate: just the nature of probability
[5:32:26] pIasmate: humans have too many built in biases
[5:32:39] pIasmate: it alters perception
[5:32:40] rustycoconut: !az

[5:33:20] ZoeGirl: voidmoons erickdHello
[5:33:35] ledoz: u were correct sir

[5:34:06] softlysupports: alooo
[5:34:14] Lazynameross: camel LUL
[5:34:17] pIasmate: do not say it stunt
[5:34:37] magicalpen: losers queue is 100% real, I've experienced it too much
[5:34:41] „Ç´„É¢„É°6: riot ddosed this camille themselves to insure you have losers queue Despairge
[5:34:43] ChromaKhroma: 15 sounds like a suspicously large amount
[5:34:46] ChromaKhroma: stuntDetective
[5:34:47] savvy_with_it: Hey, stunt, Jiji from player support might have confirmed loserq years ago
[5:35:05] Skever_: i tried to play off meta sup vi, my adc said "im not playing with a vi sup, this $2 account i'll take the 14 day" and proceeded to die 25 times Sadge
[5:35:10] BaneBladeV: it's ok trin will carry
[5:35:19] softlysupports: ofc because it's real blizzard's mentioned it too nodd
[5:35:30] TetsuyaKatsuragi: If you go on a losing streak in ranked pokemon unite, they literally match you against bots
[5:35:31] pIasmate: MMR is a bad system generally, just nothing better
[5:35:33] softlysupports: the closer ur maintained to 50% the more u naturally play
[5:35:35] savvy_with_it: Due to the difference in win% of top/bot, winrates was a part of side selection
[5:35:50] pIasmate: riot has to widen the MMR range in order to reduce q times
[5:35:59] Skever_: mmr system is only to keep people playing
[5:36:06] pIasmate: this is why chall players end up with diamonds
[5:36:07] Skever_: with the visible rank vs mmr
[5:36:21] jinky___: is it losers queue or is it like flipping a coin 1000 times and sometimes getting 10 heads in a row
[5:36:21] pIasmate: but in reality chall should never have diamonds in game
[5:36:27] ZoeGirl: maybe the real losers queue was the inters we met along the way
[5:36:28] Ty1ord: my only thing with making a loser's cue is that it wouldnt it make half the players not want to continue playing if they feel like they are guaranteed loss
[5:36:36] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[5:36:52] bussinboots: i lost 700 lp in 10 days :D and if riot not doing it then im just bad at game, sadge
[5:36:55] Skever_: @Ty1ord engagement based matchmaking YEP
[5:36:59] jinky___: big Q
[5:37:06] jp555jp: Impossible to prove the absence of something though right?
[5:37:07] ThomasTheTwink: BIG
[5:37:08] BaneBladeV: I SAID TRIN WILL CARRY
[5:37:09] ledoz: GO ZAXC
[5:37:11] jinky___: gg CHEER
[5:37:21] yonays: niceee
[5:37:27] flowerchild_nz: not disagreeing but what would be the benefit (for riot) of a losers queue?
[5:37:37] softlysupports: becaaause
[5:37:38] SalamiEnjoyer: if there's a losers queue there also has to be a winners queue the losers play against
[5:37:51] softlysupports: if u lose too much or win too much ur less incentivized to play
[5:37:54] Skever_: @flowerchild_nz to prolong the amount of time before you hit your desired rank and quit playing as much
[5:37:57] pIasmate: the problem is the MMR range on queues, it's too wide atm, but if they lessen it then queue times would be 15+ mins for masters
[5:38:11] softlysupports: if ur closer to 50ish% the more u play eavNod
[5:38:13] pIasmate: and like 20+ for chal
[5:38:17] Ty1ord: @Skever_ good point i never actually thought about that
[5:38:21] bussinboots: also, i believe it not loser queue, the team balance would be bad to see if you deserved a rank so what we call loser queue is just the game debating if we should be x rank
[5:38:34] pIasmate: remember when queue times were 6-10 mins average?
[5:38:39] flowerchild_nz: so more addicting for the winners but less addicting for the losers?
[5:38:42] pIasmate: until riot widened MMR range
[5:38:48] Skever_: @Ty1ord like riot soft resets your visible rank every season but mmr is same then you go 50% winrate and will "climb"
[5:38:49] Oracixn: imo one giga big problem they have is autofilled, why do some teams have 3 people autofilled, thats literally insane
[5:38:49] HowFoul: if it is true why would they do it in the first place
[5:38:53] savvy_with_it: I wonder if there's been any changes to mm since s14 ü§î
[5:39:03] pIasmate: MMR is not a system riot invented
[5:39:11] pIasmate: they implement THE MMR system
[5:39:37] softlysupports: certified squirtJammer SquirtleJam
[5:39:48] Skever_: the mmr vs visible rank discrepancy is the problem
[5:39:55] Skever_: but more engagement
[5:40:04] Ty1ord: like I mainly play val atm instead of league but whenever my team is full of people on loss streaks and I lose a couple of games in a row like that I end up taking a couple days break
[5:40:04] pIasmate: all riot do is adjust the parameters of MMR for queue
[5:40:12] savvy_with_it: 2 grubs*
[5:40:17] pIasmate: which is why you see diamond players in chall games
[5:40:49] BaneBladeV: Loss streaks happen for any reason. Some days you're tired, or hungry, or some IRL problem is in the back of your mind
[5:41:10] Lazynameross: the cancel
[5:41:16] softlysupports: clapp
[5:41:18] pIasmate: it's just probability, sometimes you just get 10 heads in a row, but the frequency of it happening is extremely low
[5:41:33] „Ç´„É¢„É°6: does it? how do you know
[5:41:34] Skever_: they literally have a patent on "engagement based matchmaking" they dont care about game quality they only care about you playing more
[5:42:09] icehat_702: i fear the dating apps do something similar. i'm on a huge loss streak.
[5:42:10] Sharlyc: losers queue is real, they probably use it to manipulate you into playing more
[5:42:11] pIasmate: loser q is not real, one example I give is riot has a heavy focus on "fun" and losing is never fun
[5:42:17] papartiuga: good lovely afternoon sir!
[5:42:20] Lazynameross: Smoge
[5:42:36] pIasmate: so why would riot ever implement a loser q
[5:42:37] DudeBroMaximus: Maybe if you're on a 50 loss streak they check you for inting
[5:42:42] „Ç´„É¢„É°6: interesting
[5:42:51] BaneBladeV: @pIasmate if you play master yi support, you can lose and have fun
[5:42:54] Lazynameross: owojam
[5:43:00] flowerchild_nz: @piasmate but yone exists
[5:43:12] Skever_: i've noticed that if im on a high win or loss streak my teammates are also on a streak
[5:43:16] softlysupports: yone Wokege
[5:43:19] Skever_: there is definitely something
[5:43:30] jannablowsu: i def feel like theres something
[5:43:32] BaneBladeV: confirmation bias
[5:43:34] pIasmate: yup, I asked the riot streamers yesterday on balance team/champ design, they said fun is their main goal
[5:43:38] Ty1ord: ya i usually get paired with people on similar streaks either winning or losing
[5:43:43] Ty1ord: but maybe placebo effect
[5:43:48] pIasmate: but did not elaborate how they measure fun
[5:43:56] pIasmate: except engagement
[5:44:09] Skever_: yeah thats the problem they want the run to be LONG
[5:44:09] savvy_with_it: I'd love to hear some official comments elaborating on it, tbh.
[5:44:17] Forgotten_Freedom: @pIasmate they must not play mundo then
[5:44:19] ause02: @pIasmate what're they supposed to say though? they want more engagement and therefore there'll be times when there's no fun
[5:44:26] pIasmate: because you queue up right after a loss stunt, which has a high chance of having the same team
[5:44:33] pIasmate: the trick is to wait 3-5 mins
[5:44:38] savvy_with_it: Speculation's interesting, though.
[5:44:38] pIasmate: then re-queue
[5:44:40] bussinboots: back when 3 wins in a row means someting xD
[5:44:58] BaneBladeV: @pIasmate that's good if you're not streaming to 600 people
[5:45:18] Sharlyc: just like they're trying to make us play new champions, as a jungler i got 2 briar permanents and 2 briar shards in 3 days
[5:45:18] pIasmate: no, stunt keeps us entertain regardless. I can wait a few mins
[5:45:40] ledoz: i have  a fed cat
[5:45:40] Sharlyc: there's nothing random
[5:45:40] softlysupports: Scared
[5:45:41] Veektaur_: lol
[5:45:41] ledoz: maybe too fed
[5:45:42] jannablowsu: @banebladeuwu i def feel like theres something like during winstreaks my q is ~1m during loss streaks i will have 5m queues and this is in pisslow idk what it is
[5:45:47] Veektaur_: that timing
[5:45:53] santinoxGG: apheli inter
[5:46:00] ZoeGirl: dont know why aph went melee
[5:46:06] Skever_: i mean the illaoi winrate at every rank high and low is disgusting
[5:46:17] pIasmate: Just wait 3-5 mins after a bad game, then you have a much lower chance of "loser queue" :P
[5:46:25] voidmoons: zoey owoSpin
[5:46:26] BaneBladeV: @jannablowsu the longer the q takes, that means it can't find people of your mmr, so it broadens the mmr. so long q's get more sus game quality
[5:46:30] ZoeGirl: yeah but it killed him lol
[5:46:36] DudeBroMaximus: @Skever_ its like 53%
[5:46:42] ZoeGirl: voidmoons erickdSmile hi
[5:46:46] Veektaur_: He's probably conditioned himself to go melee with red white tbf
[5:46:48] DudeBroMaximus: not as bad as Maokai lol
[5:47:05] jannablowsu: @banebladeuwu this is in gold-emerald range which is what ive played in this year there should be no shortage of players in that elo band
[5:47:16] Skever_: @DudeBroMaximus yeah its like 54-55% low elo 52-53 high elo
[5:47:28] BaneBladeV: depends on time of day, how many are queueing each role at that time, etc
[5:47:42] Lazynameross: ono
[5:47:44] icehat_702: same thing happens to me in bronze @jannablowsu
[5:47:50] Lazynameross: that range was tragic
[5:48:17] Ty1ord: theres too many variables to say for sure but to the average player the placebo is definitely there to make them feel like theres something
[5:48:20] Lil_DooDoo_Capri: Squid2 Squid4 tpanimeShirome
[5:48:23] Ty1ord: at l;east imo
[5:48:58] Skever_: they definitely take account level into the equation, if i play on fresh account i get more fresh accounts
[5:49:00] softlysupports: its so interesting league streamers really love league like they cant stand queue times
[5:49:11] jannablowsu: yeah i can definitely see it being a placebo but like theres just odd things that happen if you streak one way or the other
[5:49:13] softlysupports: i'd love to play queue games peepoBlushComfy
[5:49:29] pIasmate: the only thing it takes into account is mmr... even a fresh account can get to emerald in a few games
[5:49:30] BaneBladeV: like if for example for whatever reason a bunch of adc mains queue up, queues will take longer to find others, and then you wait 5 mins and end up with 3 autofills on your team
[5:50:18] Skever_: @pIasmate let me scrap average/median account lvl across 100 games on couple of my accounts
[5:50:19] BaneBladeV: it can be any role. just an example
[5:50:21] pIasmate: the only issue is 95% of the playerbase doesn't know how to play, especially if they get auto filled
[5:50:32] Skever_: @pIasmate scrape
[5:50:49] jannablowsu: theres no way they struggle to find fair matches below emerald though except maybe in likegigalow iron
[5:50:55] pIasmate: I watched alicopter get to emerald on a fresh account last night lol
[5:51:02] pIasmate: in like, 4 or 5 games
[5:51:18] savvy_with_it: Lots of changes in s14 ranked.
[5:51:27] BaneBladeV: yeah fresh accounts are still plat mmr idk
[5:51:40] softlysupports: how do i get that emerald mmr freshie eavCatPeek
[5:51:45] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[5:51:51] jannablowsu: eavCatPeek
[5:51:55] pIasmate: no, fresh accounts should start at 1300 elo, not sure how riot translate that
[5:52:02] pIasmate: win streaks add more mmr
[5:52:02] ThomasTheTwink: stunt said emerald is the worst elo so far
[5:52:08] ThomasTheTwink: stuntWooHoo
[5:52:23] pIasmate: 1300 or 1200 elo is standard
[5:52:34] BaneBladeV: this isn't chess
[5:52:35] softlysupports: 1300 tinkSpin
[5:52:40] pIasmate: elo is one system
[5:52:41] voidmoons: niceee
[5:52:43] softlysupports: wat r these fancy numbers
[5:52:44] santinoxGG: BIG
[5:52:47] softlysupports: BIG
[5:52:53] jannablowsu: hi sarah owoSpin
[5:53:10] ThomasTheTwink: enchanters are good when team is good stuntNoted
[5:53:21] BaneBladeV: @pIasmate and riot admitted they changed it to where fresh accounts would seed plat
[5:53:22] pIasmate: the only main difference games have with elo is the range at which elo is used to find team mates
[5:53:27] voidmoons: sheeeeeeeeeesh
[5:53:38] softlysupports: how do u stop fed kat dejj
[5:53:48] icehat_702: staff?
[5:54:35] ThomasTheTwink: kat bby where u going
[5:54:58] savvy_with_it: Independent, don't need no ren
[5:55:11] eggrinny: is it rly trin?
[5:55:15] ChromaKhroma: no
[5:55:16] Ali3va: how you feel renata atm?good or bad?
[5:55:18] cloudydaisies: nope
[5:55:19] ThomasTheTwink: for a cruise?
[5:55:20] eggrinny: o xd
[5:55:22] magicalpen: LUL yea but don't go
[5:55:29] softlysupports: i would be making -$70000 if i didnt have a scholarship
[5:55:34] denunciator: no cause you're gonna lose a kidney
[5:55:34] BaneBladeV: @eggrinny you can check gamergirl stream
[5:55:35] Skever_: @banebladeuwu did they change it or is that just because of rank distribution shift? like plat is new gold and accounts used to get placed like gold
[5:55:35] softlysupports: i might take the money
[5:55:37] Punkshifter: @banebladeuwu Whether this was said or not, it is incorrect. Fresh accounts start at approximately silver IV in their first game. They gain significantly more MMR until they are seeded so can shoot to play quickly. But the first game is approximately silver IV, dependant on queue availability at the time.
[5:55:38] zzz_iton: and ghost him ?
[5:55:44] kaiserwroth: 10k to fuck in a cruise Susge
[5:55:46] zzz_iton: sounds like a plan
[5:55:51] zzz_iton: LMFAO KAISEr
[5:55:58] eggrinny: @eggrinny i swear i checked my following and didnt see her on until u said  this LOL
[5:56:11] icehat_702: use the money to hire pirates to board the cruise and steal all its booty
[5:56:12] pIasmate: silver is around 1200 elo though
[5:56:14] zzz_iton: depend really, if you like the person or not
[5:56:14] softlysupports: i'm taking the 10k as long as i dont dejj
[5:56:14] ChromaKhroma: i would not take it either
[5:56:19] pIasmate: seems standard to me
[5:56:25] denunciator: doesn't it depend how cute the chatter is pfft
[5:56:33] Sharlyc: it's creepy because it's too much ?
[5:56:35] ThomasTheTwink: I would like 10k
[5:56:36] devlarr: Take money
[5:56:37] cloudydaisies: gg
[5:56:39] ThomasTheTwink: hehe
[5:56:42] devlarr: Go on cruiae
[5:56:53] princessstrawberry5: don‚Äôt take the money so nothing comes back to you just in case
[5:57:10] kaiserwroth: Take the money it ore that person for the entirety of the cruise then spend it all on hookers and drugs COPIUM
[5:57:15] ChromaKhroma: can u be in separate rooms on the cruise <3
[5:57:17] Sharlyc: I mean if i'm a billionaire i can give 10000 bucks to someone i like just like if i have an average job i give 10 dollars to support
[5:57:24] Skever_: @Punkshifter i've played like 3 lvl 30 accounts and first game is like plat 2/3 teammates
[5:57:25] zzz_iton: is that person a follower or someone random
[5:57:26] ChromaKhroma: on separate floors <3
[5:57:29] zzz_iton: LMFAO
[5:57:32] savvy_with_it: Probably not the precedent you'd like to set

[5:57:40] h0lymaccaroni: does this happen to male streamers aswell?
[5:57:41] maxtried: imma need more than 10k

[5:58:31] zzz_iton: somethin random s tunt thought of
[5:58:33] zzz_iton: like always
[5:58:36] denunciator: stunt is considering going on an NSA cruise or something idk
[5:58:40] kaiserwroth: Get a bodyguard to follow you in the cruise now that you can afford it ICANT
[5:58:45] pIasmate: 10k + a free cruise, doesn't sound bad unless it sexual
[5:58:48] Thommenius: Are you secretly hoping for such dono oh
[5:58:48] jannablowsu: HUH
[5:58:54] voidmoons: i remember i went onto my friends stream and one of his viewers sent me 1 dollar from his venmo
[5:58:54] softlysupports: for $100k i am steering the cruise ship idc
[5:58:55] voidmoons: i was like wtf
[5:58:56] zzz_iton: ohoho
[5:58:57] Sharlyc: So if i send in the tip note of my 10 dollars Hey bro i'm in town wanna hang out and maybe try a nice restaurant ? it becomes creepy too ?
[5:58:58] nucularspider: did you see the movie The Menu? she got paid to go to a private island as a date....

[5:59:06] ThomasTheTwink: here‚Äôs 10k pls come on cruise with me ‚Äúnah I‚Äôm good thanks for the donation though‚Äù stuntPCE2
[5:59:07] Vaaarangian: You have to say no. Sets a weird precedent
[5:59:09] Oracixn: I would keep the money and not go
[5:59:16] zzz_iton: Thomme are u gonna hit him up with the dono
[5:59:18] mute_mousou: that sounds even more sus if it's sent to a female streamer lol
[5:59:20] zzz_iton: jkl jkfLDDJSLFJSDF
[5:59:29] Sharlyc: i get it

[6:23:05] Skever_: my adc's lock it in when i pick poke before them tho
[6:23:22] Thommenius: Whats going on why are all your teammates like this today
[6:23:27] pIasmate: I don't understand why people mute themselves instead of just not typing
[6:23:42] Sharlyc: Is it fair that cassio doesnt buy boots but Nocturne does ?
[6:23:42] Skever_: @pIasmate to let you know BigBrother
[6:23:45] pIasmate: seems passive aggressive
[6:23:51] BaneBladeV: yeah just to let people know

[6:27:51] archimedes_9: did you build tear on any champ yet?

[6:28:27] mute_mousou: rip lucian

[6:32:27] BaneBladeV: we need naaf renek to break the streak
[6:32:28] Apostolique: From now on, no more meta Kappa
[6:32:38] Skever_: you can raise your adc right put them in a good school get them a good job and they turn into drug fiend by end of game anyways Sadge
[6:32:52] pIasmate: might as well g back to naafiri now, can it get any worse?
[6:33:06] Sharlyc: So far is there any offmeta support that you didnt play before that you would consider playing in a high elo game  ?
[6:33:14] archimedes_9: 167 trick Madge

[6:35:33] Skever_: @DudeBroMaximus that is my teammates drug of choice
[6:35:34] Apostolique: We will make Rell good
[6:35:44] Sharlyc: COPIUM
[6:35:46] icehat_702: the trick is to learn what the good ones taste like, then taste test before committing
[6:35:49] Sharlyc: gamba ?
[6:35:51] Apostolique: elo hell is real
[6:35:55] zzz_iton: oh look its ezreal

[6:36:22] Skever_: yummy black tar heroin Kreygasm

[6:36:25] ThomasTheTwink: my favorite drug is caffeine ok
[6:36:32] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[6:36:54] DudeBroMaximus: Yeah but it's the coffee that tastes good, not necessarily the caffeine
[6:37:08] Sharlyc: sugar tastes good
[6:37:09] DudeBroMaximus: Did I just do an ackchyually
[6:37:14] DudeBroMaximus: I need to go to bed
[6:37:48] ThomasTheTwink: ur right I need it drowning in sugar BibleThump
[6:38:07] DudeBroMaximus: Ooo some might say sugar is a drug
[6:38:09] ThomasTheTwink: GET THE KENCH BACK ON THE BENCH
[6:38:12] DudeBroMaximus: The plot thickens
[6:38:13] Lazynameross: woah is that a tk sup playing without a senna
[6:38:13] savvy_with_it: @dudebromaximus but like, actually

[6:40:19] DudeBroMaximus: Who should I play in the jung if I like Sejuani (she's kinda ass this season)
[6:40:50] pIasmate: sej has been used in a lot of pro games this season..
[6:40:52] icehat_702: nunu
[6:40:59] ThomasTheTwink: Rell
[6:41:01] Lazynameross: rell
[6:41:06] DudeBroMaximus: Holy shit Plasmate I'm not pro
[6:41:15] DudeBroMaximus: Why are your takes so bad
[6:41:24] pIasmate: if sej was bad no one would play her in pro?
[6:42:00] DudeBroMaximus: She's like 40-something %
[6:42:21] DudeBroMaximus: Pro mechanics + co-ordonation
[6:42:32] DudeBroMaximus: co-ordination
[6:42:34] icehat_702: are the baby grubs called grublets? i'm going with grublets
[6:42:47] BaneBladeV: @DudeBroMaximus similar to sej is mao rammus
[6:42:48] Sharlyc: dying for a ward classic
[6:42:59] fauthurs: @dudebromaximus u should try sej
[6:43:10] DudeBroMaximus: @fauthurs thank you
[6:43:15] DudeBroMaximus: Wait a minute
[6:43:19] fauthurs: gotchu dawg
[6:43:57] ThomasTheTwink: free cannon Pog
[6:44:03] DudeBroMaximus: @banebladeuwu I might have to dust off Rammus
[6:44:50] jjennukka: I'm craving for subway cookies right now stuntSad
[6:45:16] ThomasTheTwink: does Rell e count for Lucian passive?
[6:45:54] ThomasTheTwink: he got like a second one where he does onhit damage after he gets a buff
[6:46:05] ThomasTheTwink: but idk if that‚Äôs heal/shiled
[6:46:09] ThomasTheTwink: or just any buff
[6:46:23] icehat_702: i miss yuumi hop proccing that passive
[6:46:23] fauthurs: theres better cookies than subway?
[6:46:29] Huassassin: it works with nami e for sure
[6:46:37] Huassassin: so probably all
[6:46:46] jjennukka: @fauthurs Honestly, exactly my thoughts
[6:46:56] Ciwtxx: @ThomasTheTwink When Lucian is healed or shielded by an ally, or when a nearby enemy Champion is immobilized, his next 2 basic attacks will deal bonus magic damage.
[6:47:01] DudeBroMaximus: Wow you guys are cooking
[6:47:04] PharmDRPh: PharmDRPh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! good morning stunt and chat
[6:47:04] pIasmate: would the game be better if they removed flash?
[6:47:27] jjennukka: @PharmDRPh Morning stuntVibe stuntVibe2
[6:47:27] BaneBladeV: it would be less fun :)
[6:47:29] ThomasTheTwink: @luimies oh probably not then unless Rell had aery hehe
[6:47:35] kozkok: ghost stays?
[6:47:40] fauthurs: @jjennukka LUL
[6:47:46] DudeBroMaximus: Just now learning Lucian gets a damage boost if you immobilize his homies
[6:47:48] pIasmate: I'm curious how people would play without flash
[6:47:48] ThomasTheTwink: Nerf Flash! RAGEY
[6:48:11] currylifettv: !tierlist

[6:48:11] ledoz: how was old rell again
[6:48:12] Sharlyc: Ms rune Kreygasm
[6:48:12] BaneBladeV: the biggest nerf you can do to flash is timing it
[6:48:13] savvy_with_it: I'm still trying to get some sleep üò¥
[6:48:28] DudeBroMaximus: @savvy_with_it you're doing great
[6:48:43] BaneBladeV: EZ engage
[6:49:07] Huassassin: ah lucian passive got changed in 13.12 before taht it was all buffs
[6:49:09] savvy_with_it: @dudebromaximus ty.  I'm at 3ish hours of interrupted so far.
[6:49:21] ThomasTheTwink: ooh
[6:49:39] pyrosui: actually insane rotation pressure coming out from our boi stunt tonight
[6:49:44] DudeBroMaximus: @savvy_with_it well electronic devices are bad for that, I regret to inform lol
[6:49:48] Skever_: @savvy_with_it chats while sleeping GIGACHAD
[6:49:51] fauthurs: think ur asking for too much
[6:49:53] Sharlyc: you're not really trying if you're chatting and looking at the screen Kappa
[6:49:57] icehat_702: i would trade anything in my life for the ability to fall asleep at will
[6:50:08] ThomasTheTwink: @ledoz her q didn‚Äôt stun and her e used to link to an ally and would stun in an aoe around Rell and the ally but like only half a second
[6:50:12] currylifettv: @icehat_702 ^ that would be a cheat code
[6:50:35] Ciwtxx: @ThomasTheTwink her Q also healed.. surrounding allies or something strange right?
[6:50:44] Apostolique: 600 gold Pog
[6:50:59] ThomasTheTwink: oh I think it healed the linked ally
[6:51:06] Lazynameross: yeah linked one
[6:51:07] Ciwtxx: Oh linked yeah
[6:51:08] ThomasTheTwink: like 5% hp or something lol
[6:51:16] Ciwtxx: Such an awkward mechanic
[6:51:30] DudeBroMaximus: Tahm is such a beast champ, no idea why his WR isn't higher. I feel like every single Tahm I see is a total menace
[6:51:30] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis

[6:51:58] Cariyla: Learning
[6:52:09] Sharlyc: He doesnt snowball as much as other carry champions
[6:52:32] Sharlyc: snip snip
[6:52:35] DudeBroMaximus: Damn Lucian did some nice dodging there
[6:52:36] Apostolique: They are too tanky
[6:52:42] Sharlyc: Tahm kench
[6:52:49] JrWeise: how‚Äôs it going king? and chat hope we‚Äôre all well this morning
[6:53:30] Lazynameross: poppyDance
[6:53:47] Sharlyc: ngl you're right and that's coming from a jungler PepeLaugh
[6:53:58] jjennukka: @JrWeise Morning, hope you're well too stuntLove
[6:53:59] khyger: gp10 oracles first item and die immediately losing the 400g
[6:53:59] Skever_: agurin going thru shyv arc rn
[6:53:59] vogue_hommes: blue ezreal ruined junglers forever
[6:54:10] Sharlyc: i used to main supp but jungle has a bit more impact on the game
[6:54:13] Sharlyc: imo
[6:54:27] Apostolique: I think supp has way more impact
[6:54:57] pIasmate: sadly you can gank lanes, take all objectives and still lose... jungling is not fun atm
[6:55:07] JrWeise: @jjennukka I‚Äôm doing alright. making coffee and ready to watch stunt do some crazy shit lol
[6:55:10] DudeBroMaximus: Jung is my secondary but I just get outclassed often. I don't think I've ever beaten a Lillia for example
[6:55:22] ThomasTheTwink: fun over fair but why junglers? Hmmge
[6:55:42] Sharlyc: Lillia is not balanced
[6:55:53] blahhhhhhhghg: I think it depends. A fed mage support has tons of agency. Hook support you're basically fucked if team is losing
[6:55:57] Balldropper: this horsey has the zoomies
[6:56:15] jjennukka: @JrWeise Perfect LUL I think we have interesting champs coming up
[6:56:23] Skever_: @DudeBroMaximus that deerussy is very strong
[6:56:31] DudeBroMaximus: Lol deerussy
[6:56:32] Ghostloon: Good morning
[6:56:39] BaneBladeV: there's already a shortage of junglers in most elos, so if it gets nerfed, that affects queue times
[6:56:49] JrWeise: @jjennukka I‚Äôm excited for some renekton support üòÇüòÇ
[6:56:57] jjennukka: @Ghostloon Morning stuntVibe stuntVibe2
[6:56:58] Lazynameross: owojam
[6:57:08] fauthurs: im constantly getting teammates who get autofilled jg
[6:57:17] Ghostloon: @jjennukka stuntVibe stuntVibe2
[6:57:23] pIasmate: jg and mid have the most impact atm, then sup. But jg is the most stressful role
[6:57:27] icehat_702: this the dunder mifflin-sabre theme
[6:57:44] jjennukka: @JrWeise that's gonna be a good one stuntLUL I think imma get tea for that too
[6:57:49] ThomasTheTwink: gosh maybe more people would play jungle if they didn‚Äôt rework the entire thing every season
[6:57:50] kozkok: which is the least stressful role?
[6:57:51] Sharlyc: im always autofilled protected as a jungler on euw diamond
[6:57:51] Skever_: @pIasmate sup def more impact than mid in high elo
[6:58:16] Ciwtxx: give me support to get out of low elo. Im stuck af.
[6:58:21] ThomasTheTwink: gotta read like 3 pages just for the jungle starter items
[6:58:22] pIasmate: I'd say mid and sup about the same, mid can go to side lane for ganks though
[6:58:30] pIasmate: and mid can carry more
[6:58:30] DudeBroMaximus: I like jungs that can solo objectives early. I hate when my team doesn't help. It's tilting af
[6:58:33] Balldropper: yeah when I play support I do 3k damage and my team has to carry me <3
[6:58:58] DudeBroMaximus: @balldropper me on Milio lmao
[6:59:10] ThomasTheTwink: stuntVibe stuntCampfire2
[6:59:10] Lazynameross: owojam
[6:59:11] currylifettv: i think jgl is probably the most smurf-heavy role
[6:59:18] Balldropper: @DudeBroMaximus it is sorta scary how much damage all champs are doing this season tho :( I die so quick
[6:59:20] BaneBladeV: and top island just exists
[6:59:39] Sharlyc: Top KEKW

[9:08:48] aSleepyMoogle: Could glacial with nimbus cloak and celerity be good on sett support?
[9:09:03] zefanie1: 'u' is just the formal Dutch word for the singular 'you" and that is why he is using it.
[9:09:06] avuloseunda: @ems__c hiiiiii pekinUwu

[9:09:29] ems__c: whats the pink mean in the sheet
[9:09:48] zefanie1: rengar has more chance to snowball, riven will be a more useful support when behind imo
[9:09:49] Lazynameross: hexflash out of bush, burst real quick, dash away
[9:10:51] Lazynameross: ik youre tired of hearing it, but riven is actually a champ that abuses ingenious eclipse lol
[9:10:55] zefanie1: hexflash just to engage with w LUL
[9:11:13] avuloseunda: Go fimbulwinter on riven too hehe

[9:13:22] Lazynameross: im assuming google has a way to do it to, there should be a way to make a gradient based on number values in that column
[9:13:40] Lazynameross: ezpz way to see what was rated high and low
[9:14:55] Ghostloon: we got baited pfft
[9:15:53] zefanie1: he not leaving LUL
[9:16:43] Ghostloon: he should've just dodged the moment they pick Naut
[9:16:53] Ghostloon: we knew it wasn't gonna be Lux supp
[9:17:24] zefanie1: what about ahri with 4 tries?

[9:23:24] Ghostloon: GAMBA
[9:23:42] MaxilosGR: Moonstone+rylais first two items very useful
[9:23:49] Hambenzey: rylai so much value
[9:24:23] Lazynameross: a tempo smolder
[9:24:28] zefanie1: 30%bigger no?
[9:24:34] Lazynameross: how am i only now seeing one

[9:25:53] Criz7z: not rilays I meant shurelias
[9:26:45] Criz7z: but the movement speed doesn‚Äôt apply with skills anymore right?
[9:26:59] springrollnoodle: im looking forward to see what u will build. i often struggle with knowing what to build on her
[9:28:24] dantdmstan69: what was that lmao
[9:28:48] zefanie1: that would work if ali played in lower elo
[9:29:01] zefanie1: where the enemy won't know to insta flash
[9:31:10] Lazynameross: ono
[9:31:56] HypoTheAced: we build full crit Seraphine here
[9:32:10] springrollnoodle: is helia ever a good option?
[9:32:12] cihro1: on adc the build is seraphs into rylai b/c e will root without empowered but idk support
[9:32:27] HypoTheAced: @springrollnoodle it got buffed so maybe
[9:32:27] sumthingsup: cryptobloom
[9:32:56] Lazynameross: apc sera should just have an ally for that and build better items
[9:33:00] Gren110: GoodMorning

[9:35:03] dantdmstan69: hes lvl 3 my god
[9:35:09] cihro1: its the worst when someone is running it down and u have teammates that hostage
[9:35:34] Lazynameross: the heal lol
[9:36:16] springrollnoodle: no but he iis trolling
[9:36:28] zefanie1: that was a low key good bait of alistar LUL
[9:36:36] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[9:41:00] som963: dream bubble is so fake
[9:43:54] zadnap: Seraphine feels like the easiest enchaner to play since she's the easiest too position
[9:44:03] Criz7z: @stunt have you ever been drunk?
[9:44:23] Lazynameross: how does that work at season start
[9:44:36] Lazynameross: last season h5s only?
[9:44:50] zefanie1: I really think if the surrender vote just didn't exist, we would have more people actually trying instead of giving up after 5 minutes
[9:45:06] Criz7z: really?! omg I missed those BabyRage
[9:45:07] ash_chiming: @zefanie1 facts
[9:45:30] Lazynameross: why wouldnt there also be more griefers
[9:45:45] softlysupports: ur completely right ff vote is now a detriment eavLost
[9:45:55] Thommenius: !tierlist
[9:45:55] Nightbot: https://gyazo.com/fe99bcf00b699bbc38e233bdd0b0eca0 (14.3)
[9:46:15] Thommenius: Wait what is Z in tierllist?
[9:46:44] springrollnoodle: if only vlad had been there lol
[9:47:16] som963: is maokai still z after nerfs stunt
[9:47:23] zefanie1: @Lazynameross I get the feeling that many griefers either grief 1. to make your teammates surrender sooner, or 2. because they are annoyed teammates aren't accepting the surrender vote
[9:47:43] Ghostloon: remove surrender votes madgeNOW
[9:48:01] chaloaog: how do I only catch the real support games
[9:48:46] Criz7z: but honestly
[9:48:54] Lazynameross: if theres no ff there will def be folks taking it into their own hands to end game faster or straight afk
[9:49:11] johntbd: that vlad cant play that throw any better, baited the team to baron then just backed
[9:49:16] sumthingsup: another vlad bot play
[9:49:19] sumthingsup: lol
[9:49:23] springrollnoodle: @Lazynameross 100%
[9:49:28] Lazynameross: kinda no escaping those players imo
[9:49:39] hyzooh: best supp to carry low elo ?
[9:50:01] zefanie1: @Lazynameross Of course those people will still exist, I just think compared to now less people.
[9:50:01] johntbd: lux imo
[9:50:18] Lazynameross: fair
[9:50:23] nogxx: Seraphine E and R already slow/stun. Why get Rylias?
[9:50:44] Lazynameross: to stun easier on your own
[9:51:10] springrollnoodle: @hyzooh zyra imo
[9:51:10] ÂïäÂÖâ: but i think cdr is better than having rylais
[9:51:17] dantdmstan69: can save double cast for w or q that way
[9:51:29] sumthingsup: i once had a nami supp and she knew the tech. she would always E me just in time for my E to hit
[9:51:33] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[9:51:57] Lazynameross: monkaHmm i cant remember, was sera around during the time glacial augment slowed on basic attacks
[9:52:00] Ghostloon: they're having a troll-off
[9:52:36] IntegratedY: @Lazynameross i dont think so?
[9:52:50] Thommenius: wth was that tp?
[9:53:09] zefanie1: @nogxx sera E is a root IF the enemy is already slowed, so if you use q and then don't have empowered E you can still snare them with rylias
[9:53:31] Lazynameross: hwei zoomin
[9:54:03] Ghostloon: This person is probably not a Vlad player
[9:54:08] zefanie1: that is also why second sera E snares, because the first one alraedy slowed them.
[9:54:19] nogxx: @zefanie1 ohh I see
[9:54:29] zadnap: rylais applies slow on E, so you dont need to Q first even
[9:54:58] zefanie1: @zadnap ah rylias works before the E slow/snare calculation? damn
[9:55:21] ToastedNom: big
[9:55:34] Femuline: wow trolling draven prevails after all
[9:55:38] CarieBear: buff seraphine
[9:56:36] Lazynameross: ono
[9:56:44] Lazynameross: that flash man
[9:57:01] CarieBear: draven is a master baiter..but you still went even
[9:57:03] Thommenius: Your team just does not want to win this man
[9:57:04] Lazynameross: vlad lol
[9:57:27] Yuckaholic: !az
[9:57:27] Nightbot: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wh7mW5K4VC1CEQZMyYNQI81yoh_OjCCOupHXj3u6RDk/edit?usp=sharing
[9:57:35] Criz7z: hwei was so fast there lol
[9:57:48] ash_chiming: this game does not need coms
[9:57:59] CarieBear: coms might confuse you more frfr
[9:58:09] Ghostloon: gg
[9:58:20] ash_chiming: look it can be team reliant but I refuse to hear other people
[9:58:21] zefanie1: well, time to watch Tarzan again after hearing this song BibleThump
[9:58:28] Thommenius: nah coms would be nice additions, but those guys would just be screaming nonce
[9:58:30] rosalbba: i don't want people to flame me bc i'm a woman lol
[9:58:36] avuloseunda: catArrive
[9:58:37] softlysupports: this game is the definition of needs comms

[9:58:49] rosalbba: @avuloseunda hi cutie Lovegers  catKISS
[9:58:49] Thommenius: @rosalbba And then when you dont talk, they flame because you dont
[9:58:50] HypoTheAced: I purposely sometimes say that Im a woman in game chat and the ammount of players that start inting is insane
[9:58:53] ToastedNom: If the league community was more... sane. We could have comms, but then if they were more sane, we probably wouldn't need comms muttNotes
[9:58:54] avuloseunda: @integratedy peepoHey hiiii stuntLove2
[9:59:03] avuloseunda: @rosalbba omg hiiiiii ilysm pekinUwu
[9:59:09] IntegratedY: @avuloseunda helloooooo
[9:59:10] ash_chiming: honestly I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt happened yet
[9:59:17] ash_chiming: Valorant is fun :)
[9:59:23] Joanneuhh: valorant just as toxic lol
[9:59:26] avuloseunda: @ash_chiming peepoHey hiiii stuntLove2
[9:59:29] nogxx: Valorant you really don't have the time to type I guess
[9:59:36] ash_chiming: @avuloseunda HIII :))
[9:59:58] zefanie1: Some people thought I was a woman because of my username I guess. Then when we entered voicechat they got quiet for a bit after hearing my low voice Kappa
[10:00:00] idiocracyy: what do you do in games where you're playing either bot lane role and your top/mid/jg are getting railed and you lose every neutral and you start getting 4-manned bot?
