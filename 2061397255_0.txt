[1:10:42] Phytos11: i like the beefyness early on
[1:10:44] NeppuNeppuNee: @damndaddythiccashell warmog first item 👍
[1:11:12] t1deadlyy: @damndaddythiccashell nop, just rush hydra everygame and then build normal
[1:11:30] Kennyl4d: I have been using stridebreaker and feeling really good about it
[1:11:42] Galkaria: Go for gold, hit up that Sundered Sky
[1:11:42] Phytos11: I like what they did to Stridebreaker, minus keeping the name
[1:11:50] lucilifer12: auto reset = tempo faster more double hits very clever

[1:12:10] Kennyl4d: blade of the ruined king is not enough
[1:12:21] KeyLogan: !rank
[1:12:21] StreamElements: Cowsep is currently playing on: http://op.gg/summoners/kr/%EB%A7%9D%EA%B3%A0%EB%94%B8%EA%B8%B0%ED%8F%AC%EB%8F%84 He also has a Master+ account: http://op.gg/summoners/kr/cowsep (Grandmaster ladder update in:  8 hours 24 mins).
[1:12:25] LordGyes: What about Terminus?
[1:12:30] Kennyl4d: Terminus is dogshit
[1:12:39] lucilifer12: I use to rush titanic on kled but profane just seems so overtuned
[1:12:46] Kennyl4d: it's the worst onhit item riot has made in the history of the game
[1:12:56] NeppuNeppuNee: @Kennyl4d on yi maybe, but on ultra high attack speed champs it's decent
[1:13:03] NeppuNeppuNee: like twitch
[1:13:24] Phytos11: @LordGyes Its ok, sadly its not amazing on Yi, its better for an actual dual dmg type champ like Kayle, Kog, etc.
[1:13:41] Guardian_TK: ???
[1:13:47] XDa31: ICANT
[1:13:48] Kennyl4d: it makes more sense on twitch certainly, but I think there are still better items to take for him
[1:13:53] hylianpie: the guinsoos rageblade is kinda funny, I always thought that item should just have on hit AP scaling, but thats too smart for Riot
[1:14:00] hylianpie: guinsoos rageblade buff*
[1:14:00] NeppuNeppuNee: I'd laugh but that could easily be me missing the tower HAHAH
[1:14:02] Kennyl4d: this gameplay gives me devouver vibes
[1:14:04] fugnice: drunk driver xxD
[1:14:05] sezo_31ciogullari: did u stopped pushing grandmasters in korea
[1:14:09] Kennyl4d: tiamat tanky and killing everyone
[1:14:20] Kennyl4d: you are only missing rageblade
[1:14:21] Phytos11: @hylianpie That'd just be nashors then LUL
[1:14:23] t1deadlyy: What buff?
[1:14:28] t1deadlyy: Or you dk yet
[1:14:43] Phytos11: FROM 10 TO 6?
[1:14:45] hylianpie: @Phytos11 fuck youre right why dont they just combine the items
[1:14:46] Kennyl4d: bork
[1:14:49] Kennyl4d: hydra
[1:14:49] hashinshin_dont_ban_me: Why new suit?
[1:14:50] Phytos11: So 3 and 3 instead of 5 and 5? god bless
[1:14:51] Kennyl4d: hydra first
[1:14:54] LordGyes: @Phytos11 Yi Q can insta stack Terminus i think, it is not worth it?
[1:15:05] tonixjj01: is titanic an always first on yi this season rn??
[1:15:07] TipsyRyan: what are they lowering from 10 to 6?
[1:15:37] NeppuNeppuNee: imagine all hits from the q counted as individual basic attacks lul
[1:15:40] t1deadlyy: @lordgyes instead of taking 10 hits to full stak it now you will need only 6
[1:15:46] definitelynottracer: why didnt you rush guinsoo 2nd this game?
[1:16:00] Phytos11: @Phytos11 Yeah i dont think it does, don't quote me on that tho LUL if it does then it'd be great

[1:22:35] Phytos11: @NeppuNeppuNee from 10 to 6 to full stack

[1:25:50] ALIMSTER: @cahallo what would you says is best yi build? at least the core?
[1:25:52] Kennyl4d: Is hydra good in your games because you are buying it first?
[1:25:55] t1deadlyy: @alimster nah, dd its trash now just buy randuin as 4th 5th item vs full ad comps
[1:25:57] Kennyl4d: would it be bad as second item?
[1:26:08] HiddenDamage: naisu
[1:26:13] wllzz_: when do you decide to go kraken or when to go bork?
[1:26:16] BuckFrandon: i'd follow you irl :3

[1:26:26] Kennyl4d: hi cowsep I am Kenny from tiktok
[1:26:35] Phytos11: Kraken is a dead item now
[1:26:40] t1deadlyy: At least its better then last patch
[1:26:42] Phytos11: Cus they removed all the scaling from it
[1:26:43] ALIMSTER: @t1deadlyy thanks. So is titanic first good? or is just cowsep just having fun? :D
[1:26:59] cahallo: alimster kraken rageblade is the easiest to play, cowsep's thing is also playable, both are really good in my opinion.
[1:27:06] infiSTAR: @Cowsep to try this theory now say "0 people donated me 10k today, please donate 10k to me" :-D
[1:27:28] definitelynottracer: show head
[1:27:31] ALIMSTER: thanks!
[1:27:53] Johnfastolf: whats your name on TikTok?
[1:27:59] ALIMSTER: @Cowsep is kraken rage blade better than titanic rageblade? or are you just having fun with titanic right now? :D
[1:28:11] Kennyl4d: Is hydra good in your games because you are buying it first?
[1:28:13] BuckFrandon: giveaway your love and support :3
[1:28:25] kazukazu1: Thanks to your videos, I got to Diamond 3
[1:28:37] NeppuNeppuNee: @ALIMSTER it's good because it cancels auto, deals nice area dmg for camps, and makes you tanky
[1:28:41] Kennyl4d: How do you deal with the lack of attack speed?
[1:28:57] ALIMSTER: @NeppuNeppuNee yeah very true. will try it in next games and see how it feels.
[1:28:59] NeppuNeppuNee: @Kennyl4d who needs attack speed when you have 3k hp GIGACHAD
[1:29:04] BuckFrandon: sweating bullets? must be a real american
[1:29:18] xyznome: do you think this is the best hydra animation? SeemsGood
[1:29:27] harrynguyen1907: Hello cowsep i really want to get into coding typescript especially is there any good source for beginner ?
[1:29:28] t1deadlyy: @alimster its situational usualy best first 3 items are craken guinso hydra , but rushing hydra as first its also good
[1:29:30] Johnfastolf: there is no lack of attack speed with Guinso, ruin king
[1:29:38] ALIMSTER: when do you proc titanic? during the auto or right after the auto?
[1:29:40] badibibuu: thanks to your advice i got to rank 1
[1:29:50] Kennyl4d: so it's the auto reset that matters to you
[1:29:52] ALIMSTER: @t1deadlyy thanks!
[1:29:58] NeppuNeppuNee: @ALIMSTER right after the dmg of the auto was dealt
[1:30:12] nicovzq: where is your iron account?
[1:30:12] Kennyl4d: Why are Yimo mains so against it?
[1:30:13] ALIMSTER: @NeppuNeppuNee yeah i see cowsep doing it. such a huge burst
[1:30:20] xyznome: the auto animation of hydra, it feels more crispy than past versions
[1:30:53] Kennyl4d: I know what you wanted to say
[1:30:57] Johnfastolf: Titanic also give you more life, área attack, wich means faster clearing and more survival
[1:31:08] sinsationz: theyresheep no cows
[1:31:17] sinsationz: sheep not cows
[1:31:27] ALIMSTER: @Cowsep can we get inkshadow skin next game? :)
[1:31:49] t1deadlyy: cowSure
[1:31:50] Kennyl4d: so basically a non thinker
[1:31:56] Denthrill: I feel attacked
[1:32:02] NeppuNeppuNee: if it looks dum but it works then it's not dum 👍
[1:32:07] Kennyl4d: but do you use the default runes?
[1:32:11] Kennyl4d: or you use relents hunter
[1:32:15] Kennyl4d: relentess hunter
[1:32:15] dxdkushen123: who the fuck care about other players dont use hydra?
[1:32:22] nicovzq: do you remember when faker used yi? he went tank.
[1:32:27] t1deadlyy: You do
[1:32:40] Kennyl4d: porofessor still gives you treasure hunter
[1:33:04] ALIMSTER: @Cowsep i wish my team mates use u dot gg... i had an illaoi that went steraks first item kekw
[1:33:14] Kennyl4d: you are missing AD from eyeballs
[1:33:17] dxdkushen123: @ALIMSTER you focking dumb
[1:33:21] t1deadlyy: This are the runes i am using too
[1:33:21] nicovzq: lolalytics > u,gg
[1:33:25] t1deadlyy: Best
[1:33:28] HealthyRick: coup de grace over last stand ?
[1:33:30] sickgirlfriend: cowWave cowHappy cowHi
[1:33:36] ALIMSTER: steraks first item pog?
[1:33:39] ALIMSTER: he inted that game
[1:33:44] Johnfastolf: to be fair I use Cowsep build, it works well, but not every game is meant for the same build, sometimes you need to adjust one thing or another, this is a general build not specific
[1:33:47] NeppuNeppuNee: @ALIMSTER i've gotten tank yuumi supports on ranked lmao
[1:33:52] Qwelfalia: only true korean masters use magic feet boots GlitchCat
[1:33:56] dxdkushen123: sterak give alot of dmg also survivalbility
[1:34:01] ALIMSTER: @NeppuNeppuNee idk where these people get their builds from...
[1:34:21] Kennyl4d: cosmic insight is kind of an ass isn't it?
[1:34:22] ALIMSTER: @dxdkushen123 yeah that is great but first item?? i dont think thats a good choice...
[1:34:30] dxdkushen123: why not
[1:34:53] Kennyl4d: would Yimo mains agree with this observation?
[1:35:01] ALIMSTER: iceborn is so much better... when he was so behind
[1:35:05] t1deadlyy: You can take wards no?
[1:35:09] t1deadlyy: To stack eyeball

[1:35:31] ALIMSTER: KEKW
[1:35:31] Kennyl4d: do you ever sell the boots from runes
[1:35:38] Phytos11: godDAYUM
[1:35:40] Phytos11: ICANT
[1:36:29] NeppuNeppuNee: @Kennyl4d they're slightly better than the normal boots, why would he
[1:36:56] Phytos11: TLDR: u coinflipping if u'll use last stand, while u are deliberately doing dmg with coup
[1:37:03] t1deadlyy: @kennyl4d  you cant do it anymore , i mean you can but you get waay less gold now then before
[1:37:04] Phytos11: EZ
[1:37:12] HealthyRick: I see the logic, thanks for explaining the thinking process <3

[2:44:41] Kennyl4d: rather than slow
[2:44:48] frankfed123: ive been s;laying with titanic and feels so good but getting the components before the whole item feels weird

[3:02:20] tamnguyen1875: Hi Cowsep I'm from Vietnam !
[3:02:22] Cecilsky: Cowsep has been a dead streamer for years. Bro only plays Korea server at the beginning of the season and then hops off to more fun servers so he can enjoy his time playing. Terrible streamer can't recommend

[3:06:46] Billllllyyy__: what do you think of lethality yi?
[3:06:55] chilloriwill: Am I the only one where it "buffers" lowers in quality and goes up a little after? Qo
[3:07:02] junglenoproblem: are you still trying items?
[3:07:05] nickku1: what’s the highest rank you get players calling noob champ ?
[3:07:07] dxdkushen123: lethal yi fell off because they removed duskblade mythic
[3:07:08] spoonaroo: Bork is still best first item, no doubt
[3:07:15] shion__tempest: does e dmg apply when u Q
[3:07:17] chilloriwill: I might try that
[3:07:17] junglenoproblem: the new items are still confusing for me
[3:07:23] chilloriwill: !Chat

[3:08:23] InstaDQ: I use uBlock Origin and never see ads on twitch
[3:08:24] ACR_kakashi: @neppuneppunee i think its not worth level 1 compared to Q. since Q deals AOE to multiple monsters or deal more dmg to single camps
[3:08:26] chilloriwill: No buffering on your site.
[3:08:59] spoonaroo: I think lethal Yi would be hilarious, one lethality item gives move speed after kill
[3:09:02] chilloriwill: I do now
[3:09:06] junglenoproblem: what server is this daddy cowwy?
[3:09:06] StreamElements: server Cowsep is playing on Korea server.

[3:09:45] NeppuNeppuNee: @ACR_kakashi oh yeah ofc you gotta start with Q, but what I meant is why keep leveling the W, why not keep the W lvl 1 if you can still cancel autos with it at the minimum level
[3:09:51] Kennyl4d: how is titanic going daddy

[3:15:24] Kennyl4d: it's simple math guys

[3:17:35] junglenoproblem: i think the slow on bork is the 1st auto right?
[3:17:42] badibibuu: kenny is actually delusional if he believes that bork does nothing
