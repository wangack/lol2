[4:29:16] LetTheScoutCook: i have 16ms. is that good?
[4:30:13] LetTheScoutCook: understand
[4:30:31] Luckfr0sch: 8ms euw :>
[4:30:39] LetTheScoutCook: i definitely feel diff at 50 ms .. its so delayed
[4:31:20] barbolarbo: I have around 18 ms in euw
[4:31:30] LetTheScoutCook: euw 16ms playing from czechia
[4:31:57] Geralt_Haddy: Also depending on the reaction time in addition to ping
[4:32:58] LetTheScoutCook: what I m doing right is that I wait opponent CDs and just press attack on them and see what happens. just want to see where are the limits
[4:33:03] LetTheScoutCook: right now
[4:33:11] barbolarbo: I guess that the highest ping in euw is Spain or Greece. So most of of the euw playes have < 30 ms ping
[4:33:16] Geralt_Haddy: @ipav999 can you do a reaction time test on human benchmark website?
[4:33:52] Geralt_Haddy: im not sure

[6:55:01] tashkovv: malphite too
[6:55:33] seigebrisbane: why is yellow raging
[6:57:06] nyquil89: nyquil89 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 40 month streak! wow
[7:00:48] seigebrisbane: and I thought league was toxic, this yellow player...wow lol
[7:05:00] LetTheScoutCook: I am doing super deep testing in practice tool right now. I came to interesting conclusions... Nashor tooth does 2000 dmg in 5s .. Liandry does 1700 dmg in 5s .. but Liandry has 300 more hp so it gives same value in 1v1.. Nashor is losing value  very hard if u get cced. Its interesting how accurately it is balanced..
[7:05:44] LetTheScoutCook: Even Riftmaker outperforms Liandry if u are able to poke before all in.
[7:07:26] LetTheScoutCook: Just trying to figure out the best first item.. its depends, if opponent doesnt have any CC and doesnt treat you with burst. Nashor is great. Otherwise Liandry first item is always better.
[7:07:52] LetTheScoutCook: stat wise ->1v1
[7:08:47] LetTheScoutCook: I really like to use that 5s passive window to get accurate results
[7:09:38] LetTheScoutCook: when u get cced with Nashor.. its value drops significantly
[7:11:28] LetTheScoutCook: I mean .. RIftmaker is even better if u are able to activate its passive so I will test it in LIVE game
[7:12:06] LetTheScoutCook: abiltiy haste has almost zero value in laning phase 1v1s.. looks like ap and hp is the best for stat checking ppl
[7:12:38] LetTheScoutCook: sorry for long post msg.. i m just nerd like you
[7:14:04] LetTheScoutCook: we are talking first item tho.. what happens next is very situational.. but i would go nashor second item cuz u have more freedom in team fights than 1v1s
