[1:17:08] Freekheid: support life
[1:17:18] TheK10S: The major issue was rumble didn't move when shaco invaded lvl 3. After that it was so much easier for shaco to takeover the game.

[1:39:44] interfrenze: xdd
[1:39:48] alextrazsas90: blackout the map or get some delay perhaps
[1:39:50] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:39:57] itstotallyamber: You have the rage one no?

[1:41:11] itstotallyamber: Refunding that
[1:41:17] ZuvaStyle: Oh that's a question, any plans speedrunning Hades 2 when it comes out?
[1:41:39] psblo21242: !playlist

[1:41:46] Reap3r189: @itstotallyamber That's fine xD
[1:41:48] ZuvaStyle: Nice!
[1:41:54] itstotallyamber: @cutsceneguy Because him being an ambassador doesn't effect how the team performs
[1:41:56] crispytain: hows pop

[2:31:21] KaneTheFlame: I always think Draven E is called Whirling death, but thats his R
[2:31:46] sephw_: I mean the R is the one that kills really so makes sense
[2:31:51] iconiqtv: @habs1292 marek brazda had big brain moment and TP away from TF even tho he was low
[2:31:52] habs1292: @Deufje he only won against tf cause of elder buff, it was v close
[2:31:54] TheZoulStormer: Me neither
[2:32:01] jaggler: @KaneTheFlame every skill of Draven is some kind of whirling death, so it's understandable

[3:12:52] qduke: who do u reckon will win this split ?
[3:13:18] TexDisorder: FNC Did take a game off G2 tho early in playoffs?
[3:13:20] eduardocf123: EdG2 agains the machine
[3:13:31] Very_salty_sailor: G2 is looking insane rn
[3:13:46] CappedAt40: Naut skin is so good
[3:13:46] Rilea_: Caps is looking incredible
[3:13:59] itstotallyamber: I wouldn't say G2 is insane, but certainly may ahead of the next best team in LEC
[3:14:01] eduardocf123: if you loose he is still scripting hahah
[3:14:09] Rilea_: @itstotallyamber Agreed ccatNODDERS
[3:14:12] itstotallyamber: way*
[3:14:22] eduardocf123: @itstotallyamber I think G2 peak is just top tier, too bad they've been very inconsistent
[3:14:31] qduke: G2 is like a low tier lck team while the rest of the EU is looking worse than NA tbh
[3:15:16] firsttimechatterman: top 8 maybe
[3:15:34] Xepheria_: so long as they don't show up to another international event and be scrim merchants
[3:15:36] Xepheria_: again
[3:15:39] crispytain: maybe a crazy take but i think fnc have enought volatility to beat g2 but bds doesn't, but none of that matters because MDK clears xdd
[3:15:45] eduardocf123: xdding
[3:15:47] bribebymclovin: @qduke geng and t1 only ones to beat g2 consistently right now
[3:15:50] Hurrica1n: If you consider that beside T1/GG, rest is low tier, yeah G2 is low tier but G2 beat KDF easily. G2 is more middle tier lck
[3:15:51] Zoephobia: why is TF suddenly a multilane flex pick????
[3:16:07] normann7777: Fnatic wins MSI this year hands down xdding
[3:16:08] qduke: @bribebymclovin I feel like HLE and KT would as well
[3:16:15] Rilea_: @Zoephobia He got a load of AD/crit buffs, so he can be played as AD or AP
[3:16:16] bribebymclovin: No shot

[3:21:10] RestfullCoffee: New Orleans was a french city
[3:21:18] itstotallyamber: TIL
[3:21:28] Museus7: Unsubbing, I was mocked by a rando on stream
[3:21:30] VizeReZ: Yes. I have been watching a ton of it from the US.
[3:21:30] RestfullCoffee: was also Spanish for awhile
[3:21:41] itstotallyamber: @Museus7 Unlucky
[3:21:43] NotDyem: HELLO MEDIC, GRINDSET TODAY WITHOUT RATLORD?
[3:22:14] Museus7: How hang on, why does that jungle entrance look so fucking weird
[3:22:28] itstotallyamber: Map changes
[3:23:11] Zoephobia: because it's funny
[3:23:18] Museus7: Crazy, they look so minor on the minimap but on cam it's jarring
[3:23:40] alexdanilius0: that’s map cover!
[3:23:42] itstotallyamber: Yeah it took some adjusting for me haha
[3:23:51] Cinnamen: All that talk into a double LUL
[3:24:03] bribebymclovin: bro is lowkey playing a magnificent naut
[3:24:03] Museus7: Oh, that looks much different lol
[3:24:06] saber_kofk: lmao naut double
[3:24:36] itstotallyamber: Baron can also spawn three different pits
[3:24:40] crispytain: sometimes the right play isn't worth risking the egos of your league player™️ teammates Sadge
[3:24:54] Museus7: I swear I haven't been away that long, did all this happen in like one patch
[3:25:08] RestfullCoffee: yeah happened with season 14.1
[3:25:09] itstotallyamber: It was live for season start mid Jan
[3:25:09] alexdanilius0: new season patch yeah
[3:25:56] itstotallyamber: We now have one less shelly, with the addition of void grubs
[3:26:02] itstotallyamber: And you can ride shelly
[3:26:09] itstotallyamber: A lot happened LUL
[3:26:34] Museus7: "We’re substantially reducing the ability for other lanes to affect top in the early game" - READ: not enough people said "top island" in chat recently
[3:26:39] VizeReZ: baron has hands with fingers now
[3:27:01] Museus7: @itstotallyamber is this a meme
[3:27:06] itstotallyamber: Nope
[3:27:16] Sandrian: Shelly bestest F1 car on the grid
[3:27:22] VizeReZ: You hop in and steer Shelly like Sion ult
[3:27:23] RestfullCoffee: that is straight up facts
[3:27:52] Museus7: It's a whole new game
[3:27:58] itstotallyamber: Kinda
[3:28:10] itstotallyamber: I would say 'refreshed' rather than new
[3:28:18] itstotallyamber: But it is a lot of new new
[3:28:53] VizeReZ: removing mythics and the other changes made it fresh enough for me to come back to playing.
[3:29:00] itstotallyamber: I especially like that baron actually looks more like a void creature
[3:29:30] thedom37: !duo
[3:29:30] StreamElements: Medic is currently playing with Remix! http://twitch.tv/remixlol1/
[3:29:38] VizeReZ: I hate barons hands. its a great design.
[3:29:54] Sandrian: Awww
[3:29:59] Sandrian: We missed Zac riding Shelly
[3:30:33] Museus7: @VizeReZ Weren't mythics just added like yesterday

[3:31:04] CappedAt40: Going to play an Urf, who should i play?
[3:31:04] larks90: why didn't they make a tv show of flubber
[3:31:16] itstotallyamber: @larks90 Great question
[3:31:25] itstotallyamber: I would have killed for that
[3:31:41] VizeReZ: I think because you would need Robin Williams to make it work.
[3:31:42] Museus7: "[Voidborn] Blue and Red grant their buffs to the entire team of the player responsible for the takedown" 👀
[3:31:42] thedom37: Does runaan work with TF cards?
[3:31:54] Avarosa0: which rat is he talking about ? caedral ?
[3:31:55] VizeReZ: I dont think he was ever interested in TV.

[3:32:14] itstotallyamber: @Avarosa0 Myes
[3:32:19] Toelboell: @CappedAt40 rakan!
[3:32:20] Museus7: All I'm hearing is that if i ever get back into League I have to completely relearn Jungle
[3:32:45] itstotallyamber: A smidge
[3:32:47] CappedAt40: @Toelboell Havent played rakan in years!
[3:32:48] Deufje: @Museus7 Easy pve, walk into lane with a numbers advantage, get free easy kills, it's still freelo role.
[3:33:01] GhostxxHorse: Oh great, now I have to listen to Panic! At the Disco today
[3:33:07] VizeReZ: First Shelly is just getting grubs now. a few new gank paths.
[3:33:20] bribebymclovin: aurelion sol happened xdd
[3:33:20] VizeReZ: Its less than it looks like.
[3:33:30] Pa1ntLIVE: do you feel like casting made you better at the game?
[3:33:55] thedom37: but runaan works with jinx Q, isnt it similar?
[3:33:56] crispytain: colossal sup gap LETSGO
[3:34:28] itstotallyamber: @Pa1ntLIVE There is some degree of 'symbiosis'
