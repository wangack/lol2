[6:43:13] my_gf_is_a_pawggers: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Pepega the Retarded? I thought not. It's not a story the High Elo players would tell you. It's a Silver legend. Darth Pepega was a Dark Lord of the Silver, so boosted and so retarded he could use his Flame to influence the outcome of the game... He had such a knowledge of the flame, he could even keep the ones who tried to carry him from winning. The dark side of the Mental is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful

He was a devious tyrant who killed visitors to show off his power. This violation of the sacred hospitality tradition greatly angered the gods. They punished him for trickery of others, including his cheating death twice. The gods forced him to roll an immense boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down every time it neared the top, repeating this

Don't fucking judge me dude, I reckon half of you fuckers did it man.

Jeg ville se hvad al den fucking 'hype' handlede om. Okay, jeg var tretten år gammel, jeg havde lige opdaget onani, jeg tænkte "hmm, gad vide hvordan min sæd smager", så jeg tog en lille smag, okay. Lad være med at fucking dømme mig fyr, jeg tror halvdelen af jer skiderikker gjorde det mand.
