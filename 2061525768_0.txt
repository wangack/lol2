[1:48:46] AMuller: That's a friend right there
[1:48:49] Conman5794: This guys looks exactly like "Joe" you see at the bar sometimes. He works at the factory and drives an old ford.
[1:48:54] 1LLU5TR8D_P1P: @ChessMatch the Flea Markets down there are LEGENDARY
[1:48:59] LucklessBA: @AMuller no friend of mine

[1:51:35] CadaverElite: Some Alex Jones level genetic memory bullshit
[1:51:38] callipse: snakes are cute little noodles. spiders? absolutely fucking go die
[1:51:39] ChucktownTiger: Oh shit did he get that turbo from Harrys? I saw Hector is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with spoon engines. And on top of that he just came into Harry's and he ordered 3 T66 turbos, with NOS, and a Motec system exhaust.
[1:51:40] captain_nuno: A good spider had just 2 or 3 legs in a asymmetrical distribution... I have performed many surgeries
[1:51:46] strictlyFOGO: the uncanny valley always fascinated me- like there had to be something in our genetic history that looked similar to humans but was a threat to our survival and now anything that looks vaguely human freaks us out

[1:53:14] Vibranator: smoked in pp
[1:53:25] ElaD_O: There's a very interesting recent study on generational trauma with I think it was deer that used to live opposite sides of an electric fence and many years later their bloodline still don't reproduce with deer from the other side and refuse to cross where the fence was. There are also studies on 3rd and 4th generations of holocaust survivors to show how it works with humans
[1:53:28] kleb0rg: turns out urban combat sucks real bad
[1:53:45] iGruesome: i walk into wine cellar on fround zero from the bar side and a guy is holding the other door in the room waiting for me to  walk in
