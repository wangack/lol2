[1:19:42] gerardstark07: seems like playing smolder behind in gold is useless
[1:19:51] qwertaas1: dont you lose a lot of early game spike power withouth sheen item?
[1:19:55] Dorksong: Good Day Jack, how do you decide which Build to go for which game?
[1:20:00] thebuzzzkilla: Do you think youre missing dmg w/o spellblade?
[1:20:00] DonaldMungchi: @portocaps Akali is pretty good for a 30 year old

[1:30:46] JekeDano: isnt lvp game tmrw?
[1:30:49] Archnomad: The clip cuts off early, lathy does say immediately after "THIS is why we need to nerf bard btw."
[1:30:55] Choc_xD: nah no way a 3 item bard does more than a 3 item jax
[1:31:20] lattestream: "I guess 3 item bard" as if bard having 3 items on supp is a testament to him 1v1ing jax in base
[1:31:26] lattestream: people will say jax played it bad
[1:31:49] Archnomad: yeah or enchanters don't fall off but their impact is delivered through other champions. You don't see lategame milio/sona 1v1ing jax even tho they're strong late
[1:31:56] Archnomad: it's fucked LUL
[1:31:57] reacheeh: thoughts on kalista nerfs? She has 50% winrate in proplay, struggles in soloq but gets nerfs because shes getting picked a lot in proplay lol

[1:33:02] beavertje: kalista <3
[1:33:21] philzu: ad build is kraken terminus i think
[1:33:26] ItsYah1r15: Kalista PepeHands
[1:33:27] lattestream: @reacheeh nobody said she's easy but if champions were balanced around people not being able to play her it'd be fucked up
[1:33:30] emmanouelxd: so ks terminus
[1:33:34] Bo_sBurner: ig kaisa has chromas? what
[1:33:39] henkeshlol: kraken term rage

[1:34:16] philzu: you can i dont know how good it is rn tho
[1:34:21] Bo_sBurner: and probably not available anymore i guess? @philzu
[1:34:25] ercomthf: collector strong with q
[1:34:26] reacheeh: @lattestream idk it kinda hurts that my main champ is getting nerfed after being viable for 2 patches only xD
[1:34:30] sapo_rust: kraken collector
[1:34:30] philzu: @Bo_sBurner nah sadly not
[1:34:33] aloneinthedisco_: hi
[1:34:33] sapo_rust: my hidden op build
[1:34:41] reacheeh: @lattestream her ultimate should be reworked, too op for proplay and really weak for soloq
[1:34:43] philzu: @Bo_sBurner maybe it comes back next worlds
[1:34:53] rammersvampen: Have you tried other runes on Kai'sa? Like celerity gatering storm?
[1:34:53] juankar977lr: isnt heal much better in lane this game
[1:34:57] lattestream: @reacheeh what elo are u, no flame or ego, just out of interest
[1:35:07] sapo_rust: go noon quiver pickaxe dirk > kraken > collector

[1:35:38] thebuzzzkilla: thoughts on Ghost and exh this game :D
[1:35:49] thebuzzzkilla: like no flash
[1:36:15] lattestream: fair, I think the ult is pretty insane in solo q, it just does it's job with engage supports but in lower elos people probably dont know how to use it effectively
[1:36:20] imajhinious: guys go see the new draven vid  dont ask
[1:36:31] lattestream: kalista naut hitting 6 makes one shit oneself
[1:36:33] rednal13: when would you go hail of blades instead of lethal
[1:36:34] philzu: yea rageblade is also pretty nice for kaisa with the buffs
[1:36:38] imajhinious: the crazy content machine is working non stop
[1:36:43] inferno1393: what runes did you go
[1:37:01] reacheeh: @lattestream i mean yeah, its not useless but u literally dont have 2 abilities when support is not near to u xD
[1:37:05] rammersvampen: throw him under the bus xdd666
[1:37:22] BedBound: Do it now after FB
[1:37:45] lattestream: @reacheeh but do u even really need more than those, I've never felt underwhelmed trying to 1v1 someone as kalista

[3:06:56] mono_brown: honestly? It was IV drugh use, dirty needles
[3:07:02] ascuane: hahahaha

[3:07:40] ascuane: influx KEKW
[3:07:42] mono_brown: isnt mao support still like 54% winrate after they supposedly nerf it for support
[3:08:05] ascuane: maybe bcs all the elo inflated players are playing it
[3:08:09] imajhinious: @Jackspektra thoughts about shojin 3rd instead of navori on ezreal? noah stomped on it yesterday
[3:08:25] nello_111: maokais a tad inflated
[3:08:31] mono_brown: Maokai support has a 56.83% win rate in Emerald+ on Patch 14.3 coming in at rank 2 of 73 and graded S+ Tier on the LoL Tierlist.   DAMMMMN
[3:08:44] mingeeatingdisorder: @imajhinious the ezreal guy explained that already
[3:09:08] draven2win: @Jackspektra you didn't flash cuz kaisa R right?
[3:09:15] ascuane: arent those pretty different items
[3:09:35] ascuane: like shojin tad tankier, navori prob more dmg?
[3:09:54] imajhinious: yes but they amp abiliry dmg hence they re comparable
[3:09:55] bacimbombu: navori-more dmg but less survivability and conditional cd on spells shojin- tankier and always has the ability haste, but less dmg
[3:10:26] ascuane: @bacimbombu yea you basically just summed up what both items do.. xD
[3:10:39] ToneDoLOL: ive been thinking that the shojin build is better than crit do you agree @Jackspektra
[3:10:57] bacimbombu: if you are good ez and can hit spells- navori, else shojin?
[3:11:25] ascuane: yea its really weak on 1 item
[3:11:28] ToneDoLOL: im asking since im stucker bad
[3:11:43] ascuane: i also legit feel kinda weak on 2 items vs enemier 2 items
[3:11:51] scooterxoxo: ER into shojin huge brain
[3:12:01] ascuane: the shojin build is really sick at 3 items and at 4 youre a god
[3:12:19] mingeeatingdisorder: shojin build if you think team can carry
[3:12:47] ToneDoLOL: since smolder is played for late and im in emerald so games are longer i think shojin better
[3:13:59] ascuane: adc OMEGALUL adc OMEGALUL adc OMEGALUL adc OMEGALUL adc OMEGALUL
[3:13:59] ToneDoLOL: 0 6 unlucky
[3:14:03] TrUPanikK: 0/6 btw xdd
[3:14:11] aloneinthedisco_: 200 overkill xdd
[3:14:13] scooterxoxo: good role
[3:14:13] ToneDoLOL: 0 6 1 item assassin unlucky
[3:14:16] ercomthf: maybe crit isnt the way
[3:14:23] mono_brown: called his mom and still lost RIP, he is gonna get bullied tomorrow in class
[3:14:26] imajhinious: @Jackspektra i tried triforce shojin manamune liandry and after shojin it felt amazing
[3:14:32] ToneDoLOL: and thats why crit is not good @Jackspektra
[3:14:34] ascuane: shojin wins that KappaPenis
[3:14:54] ToneDoLOL: shojin riftmaker wins that KappaChunggity
[3:15:20] imajhinious: i think riftmaker is bait
[3:15:27] imajhinious: manamune fekt way better
[3:15:35] imajhinious: felt
[3:15:54] ascuane: i think its hard to compare an item that you have to stack for a while to an item that you just buy

[3:16:14] ToneDoLOL: one game i auto piloted and did shojin navori and it was not that bad
[3:16:16] imajhinious: u just finish it 3rd
[3:16:32] ascuane: yea but then you have to buy tear, thats also a downside xd
[3:16:35] ercomthf: @imajhinious not biut, shiojin-rift has >54% wr and 14k picks
[3:16:39] ercomthf: bait*
[3:17:10] ascuane: @imajhinious youre already piss useless early as smolder, if you delay ER by 400g can be tad painful
[3:17:22] Faramir1993: when u fly ER buff looks like balls
[3:17:25] imajhinious: we re not talking about er build
[3:17:31] ascuane: oh yea
[3:17:35] ascuane: i mean it goes both ways
[3:17:50] imajhinious: @ercomthf i tried the manamune build and then solf manamune for riftmaker at 6 items
[3:17:51] nectarios_: i swear shojin tri force is so good
[3:17:54] imajhinious: it felt worse
[3:17:57] imajhinious: idk
[3:18:11] imajhinious: sold*
[3:18:19] ascuane: manamune should always feel better
[3:18:29] ascuane: bcs it sets you slightly behind early
[3:18:44] ToneDoLOL: do you guys have any idea what they re changing in smolder 14.4 ?
[3:18:45] Neat1996: How you doing today Jack?
[3:19:09] MrCelerie: from my experience, i feel like er does more damage and scales faster, but the extra hp and the option to go ibg is nice into teams that can easily access backline
[3:19:12] Dorksong: @ToneDoLOL Will probably be released the next couple of days, always happens when they share the overall plan
[3:19:30] aloneinthedisco_: champ is very balanced in front to back
[3:19:34] ToneDoLOL: kinda early 225 stacks gg

[7:45:21] originaljackster: bard is just counting down to when he decides he's too good for you and starts to permaroam. atleast that's how it goes in my games lol
[7:45:40] sterlynny: There's just a lot I feel the need to improve on it's a little overwhelming. I was flamed for every aspect. Laning, all-ining, positioning, etc in replay
[7:45:54] sterlynny: Idk what to do and worried about if I'll even improve or if I'm mechanically stuck
[7:46:13] nejjx_: looking good jackieboy
[7:47:34] pettymo_: @sterlynny bro I'm b2 and my friends are diamond-master, and I want to get better to play with them, so don't worry
[7:47:40] oneshotreceiver: @sterlynny feel you, also went from d1 to d3 but you have to improve one thing at a time. focus on one thing for like 10 games, then next one
[7:48:17] sterlynny: tyty
[7:48:31] valo_ren: @sterlynny The same happened to me, I was told I was sh1t at everythign I was doing. as a b4 player. BUT I got better through one step at a time, first getting 7-9 CSPM, then trading, and eventually I made it p1 last season. Point is, you got this. Just take it slow, and it'll pay off
