[1:50:56] zagreus7274: Well technically genesis is 4th game
[1:51:09] zagreus7274: But u only play as war and strife
[1:51:14] TiodoPave_1: @zagreus7274 it's not a main game
[1:51:19] TiodoPave_1: it's a
[1:51:24] TiodoPave_1: i forgor the name
[1:51:37] zagreus7274: @tiodopave_1 it's technically sequel

[1:52:20] TiodoPave_1: @AutolykusLoL what's the name of the games that are part of the story but side from the main "1, 2, 3" games?
[1:52:26] zagreus7274: Genesis takes place before everything else that happens

[1:57:09] TiodoPave_1: i'm telling u that they said long long time ago that they said that 3rd game was a fury and strife game
[1:57:11] zagreus7274: Like it goes from genesis, to then playing 1 up until u beat the first boss. Then games 2 and 3 happen at the same exact time. Then once you beat those you then finish the rest of 1 @tiodopave_1
[1:57:16] TiodoPave_1: than they changed
[1:57:21] YEhanButterfingErs75: does sett counter trynd?
[1:57:27] YEhanButterfingErs75: isnt it the opposite
[1:57:30] TiodoPave_1: and it became what darksiders 3 is
[1:57:31] TiodoPave_1: but
[1:57:34] YEhanButterfingErs75: aut0D
[1:57:51] zagreus7274: @tiodopave_1 I swear strife needs his own game
