[2:58:55] HealingAnt: senna also piks one trap
[2:59:48] StayMiIked: I would argue this teemo build only looks good on paper. if that makes sense. His end of game stats will look good only. To much reliance on your teammates to clean up.
[3:01:46] HealingAnt: the ap resist items this season are to op even tho the build is good against tank does nothing squishys melt
