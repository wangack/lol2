[0:22:58] honeymustard91: @U7Saber without indicator the skill comes out faster im p sure
[0:23:02] SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI: it is not personal preference
[0:23:05] faikenz: I wonder if he reads chat
[0:23:06] Admoon416: it is
[0:23:11] SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI: indicator is sometimes good you want separate hotkey for that
[0:23:23] wingstoawakening: He does inbetween games
[0:23:27] Tyluuuhh: yeah indicator adds a buffer timer
[0:23:33] SHLOMO_SHEKELSKI: "personal preference" is most useless comment of all time
[0:23:35] Redfactor3: @U7Saber its just slower than normal quickcast. Also for me personally it just felt weird for it to cast on release, must be the years of conditioning for key press = cast
[0:23:42] honeymustard91: qc with indicator doesnt shoot the skill until you release the key right?

[2:36:48] Gooshman: @EgyptianOverlord Pobelter filled top as Ornn. None of his 4 teamates 6 items were upgradeable rendering Pob with smither's blue balls. The icing on the cake was his AD's GA went on cooldown and he specifically asked him to build an item that can be upgraded on Ornn. He did not do so meaning even his 7TH item could not be upgraded. This was traumatizing.
