[2:17:40] AntlerWeasel: So hes running Dead Mans Switch and uh, whats the explosion one
[2:17:47] Sleater_Nickey: When I play killer I feel like I get thrown to Oak, Offering, Sabo, Flashlight, Boil Over teams 3 out of 5 matches. Which is fair, play how you want to
[2:18:00] miichellemoon: @AntlerWeasel pain resonance!
[2:18:03] AntlerWeasel: Probably
[2:18:06] sadace_: @doctorcatphd Ah, I see. Haven't had anything like that. The UI is shit and finicky, but I haven't had much buffering issues for VODs.
[2:18:19] SillySimp4GhostFace: hey John, great to catch you live. i‚Äôve been very entertained by your ghost debunking videos and i only recently discovered you play DBD.  your a legend my man
[2:18:41] sadace_: @doctorcatphd maybe just do the age old uninstall and reinstall?
[2:18:57] Sleater_Nickey: That‚Äôs kind of how I feel about it, though, yeah lynxiDerpy

[2:19:26] Sleater_Nickey: Grim Embrace
[2:19:28] BlackestBane: is that DMW or Grim Embrace?
[2:19:34] BlackestBane: DMS*
[2:19:36] arcanejaz: grim embrace and dead mans switch is such a nasty combo
[2:19:46] BlackestBane: oh he has both?
[2:20:28] mermaidfeces: wtf he was fast
[2:20:40] HatakeHachiko: i cant with the way wesker run there, looks so goofy
[2:21:02] BlackestBane: recently
[2:21:04] BlackestBane: yeah
[2:21:05] AntlerWeasel: its really strong if you space it out
[2:21:12] Shiimeow: yeah it was like last week or something
[2:21:27] sadace_: @hatakehachiko "Grrr, I'll get you yet!" kind of run
[2:21:35] Sleater_Nickey: Grim Embrace, Pain Rez, and Deadman‚Äôs is the new combo
[2:21:48] jordan_michelle: I feel like I saw this build he appears to be running in a spookyloopz video recently
[2:21:51] arcanejaz: yeah grim embrace makes you let go of the gen and DMS blocks the gen for the full 30 seconds
[2:22:23] BlackestBane: grim embrace blocks the gen/makes you let go after a hook or smth

[2:23:21] sadace_: Basically a forced Thrilling Tremors, right
[2:23:33] AntlerWeasel: No just one per survivor.
[2:23:37] DieseIWeaseI: Once per survivor
[2:23:38] AntlerWeasel: That was Dead Mans Switch
[2:23:43] arcanejaz: every hook for the first time like pain res
[2:24:06] sadace_: Ah, Pain Res for hooks makes sense
[2:24:06] MorbinBot: Say hello to the new survivor, Alan Wake! He will be available starting January 30th. https://snipboard.io/OcPQKM.jpg
[2:24:14] sadace_: I mean not hooks
[2:24:15] Sleater_Nickey: One token per survivor on Grim Embrace. Each time a survivor is first hooked and killer runs a certain distance it burns a token
[2:24:30] sadace_: I meant gen block, oop
[2:24:34] AntlerWeasel: Pain Resonance is still the same yeah
[2:24:42] Sleater_Nickey: Fourth token blocks the gens for 40 seconds
[2:24:46] sourdough101: You'll get there, sadace LUL

[2:24:49] Sleater_Nickey: Yeah
[2:24:54] arcanejaz: yes mashaNodders
[2:25:04] sadace_: They seem the same, but one blocks and one damages? I swear I play this game and can type

[2:30:04] sourdough101: @hayleethefrog Artist I believe
[2:30:10] sadace_: Pain Res is so annoying on a regular basis. Lights Out isn't so bad for me cuz it's an escape from meta perks lmao

[2:31:31] DieseIWeaseI: I hate it as survivor.
[2:31:37] AntlerWeasel: No yeah its hellish how sweaty some killers can get.
[2:31:40] Sleater_Nickey: I started running Deception and got off a really good one this morning with Gary. It got me an escape
[2:31:59] arcanejaz: imo Lights out is a unimaginative somewhat lazy first idea for a game mode that can be easily ruined by the player base
[2:32:04] jordan_michelle: is that the next charity stream?
[2:32:07] ghostlymeeks: Dbd is one of those games that I spend a few hours on then get off LUL

[2:33:11] DieseIWeaseI: I'm burnt out with dbd
[2:33:41] ghostlymeeks: It sometimes depends on the matches I have too that determines how long I play it that day

[2:33:59] NakkidFrodo: Like nothing else exists in their life

[2:34:11] camykw: Hey John. I know you've been playing Stray now. Are you open to playing, 'It Takes Two'?
[2:34:12] wrestlingfan15: Yeah it's tough to commit to making content on one game
[2:34:16] Amentih: but aren't there fog whisperers who also play different games on stream/youtube & have less viewers as you?
[2:34:32] Amentih: than you* not as you
