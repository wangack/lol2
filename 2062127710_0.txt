[1:02:51] bra1k: howw do you deal 5 true damage to minions
[1:02:51] wx52: !zwag
[1:02:52] Nightbot: I’d say Zwag is better as an example. I’ve watched a few of Pekin’s vids and he consistently misses skill shots in addition to poor leading and predicting, although the prediction doesn’t matter so much because I’d say most players aren’t good with predicting how another player will move. Champs like Amumu are pretty forgiving with bad skill shots but his past Zoe vids have been painful to watch, although the most recent one was much better. Chatting

[5:26:22] SunlightGamer924: the only 1v9 games i've had on smolder is when i go spear into full tank
[5:26:25] Sikenzu_: smolder seems like the dumbest champ atm, especially in bot lane because you free win your lane but need a human team to do damage

[5:28:01] Onyx_Drip: Nemesis has been popping off with smolder
[5:28:03] HexAlmiah: Lower max stacks would be nice
[5:28:10] Sikenzu_: shift power from where? his W to his Q?
[5:28:20] ChadingoYitten: his E should be more powerful idk
[5:28:27] mvious000: I feel like crit is useless in his current kit and should be removed for better scaling, thoughts?
[5:28:51] SunlightGamer924: Pekin do you have any ideas for another climb series?
[5:28:56] jnemo: @mvious000 except the opposite. They need to lean him into crit and make bruiser/tank dogshit
[5:29:11] itsnotmyjob2: it just feels like he doesn’t do enough damage compared to other adcs
[5:29:12] mvious000: Crit on Q is the next best thing but i dont know how that works
[5:29:22] DannyTheDopest: I personally wish someone would do a flex ranked climb with comms Sadge
[5:29:26] naom1ch: pekin youre so handsome today catRUB
[5:29:29] hallega: hwei game?
[5:29:38] Onyx_Drip: Have you seen anything about that hell divers 2 game?
[5:29:40] Sikenzu_: @jnemo but how? items like shojin and liandries + rift maker are too insane on him cause of the 225 q buff
[5:29:43] jkattan: Mario Party music
[5:29:44] jnemo: nerf his super early, buff his mid, and touch up his endgame, with that forcing a crit adjacent build
[5:29:51] EPM69: will Pekin hit number 1 rank in NA this season?
[5:30:06] wizard_brain: just pick kayle
[5:30:06] sixpairsofsocks: poll of 5
[5:30:07] jnemo: @Sikenzu_ gut the true damage base and make it scale with crit back up to its current numbers.
[5:30:08] Nemo_1606: climb on Chats mom challenge. ayeeee
[5:30:10] DannyTheDopest: randomizer climb, easy
[5:30:13] Shxdow28: Spin a wheel 5 times then poll
[5:30:16] sixpairsofsocks: then have discord/twitter choose
[5:30:19] Amedarra: I might repeat myself but you should look into the nuzlock challenge, it looks hella fun to watch
[5:30:21] mvious000: @PekinWoof can you narrow it down by popularity through a site or something?
[5:30:22] michealclout14: cant you just say top liked comment
[5:30:29] the_unstoppable_t_rex: randomize like 5 champs and then put those 5 in a poll
[5:30:38] DannyTheDopest: Yeah that true people definitely enjoyed that about off meta i think
[5:30:38] readerotl: ultimate bravery climb?
[5:30:39] luuperr: @the_unstoppable_t_rex
[5:30:43] adjutanteuw: Maybe do a poll to select 5 champs to play that day?
[5:30:48] the_unstoppable_t_rex: im like thanks
[5:30:50] Electrolite: Make a wheel of fortune to decide what to play @PekinWoof
[5:30:50] SunlightGamer924: How about you do a challenger climb... but its DoTA 2
[5:31:01] bipbipbopbopog: Aha so you just want views! I knew it!
[5:31:09] Amedarra: @adjutanteuw polls are really cool for youtube algorithm, I heard
[5:31:10] the_unstoppable_t_rex: on youtube silly!
[5:31:11] Skye_The_Weeb: i think discord will reach the most people
[5:31:11] adjutanteuw: Twitch, fuck em youtubers and discorders
[5:31:14] adjutanteuw: They are inbred
[5:31:22] sixpairsofsocks: youtube bc biggest fanbase

[5:33:22] chucklel: @pekinwoof the winner can decide
[5:33:23] Heronian_: winner chooses champ?
[5:33:26] DiscardWolf: just ask the winner
[5:33:30] ashugru: YES
[5:33:30] Shxdow28: Let's test it right now

[5:35:06] Cioval: ono
[5:35:10] DannyTheDopest: You could read them and then type them, probably only have to do it 200 times every time
[5:35:12] luuperr: ff
[5:35:15] Onyx_Drip: ig it would just have to be whoever wins choses the champ maybe
[5:35:29] Mistrusting: cant people just change their steam name
