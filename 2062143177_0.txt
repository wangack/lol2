[0:34:18] viking_stellair: insane that they duo in soloq for fresh unranked to 1 !
[0:34:47] imYogi: yeah im not sure why, i guess its because the league is on a 2 week break in the middle of the split
[0:35:14] imYogi: but they only really have maybe like 30-40 games til they acant duo anymore id guess
[0:35:21] imYogi: probably less
[0:36:06] viking_stellair: ok
