[2:29:10] jojayjoo: do tips at restaurants get split among multiple people???
[2:29:23] KentavrZ: Usually, the food itself already has a portion of the workers costs in the price... @Wingsofdeath
[2:29:32] shadowyyplays: @jojayjoo depends on the employer

[2:29:59] krieger8772: There was this one time i order food took 3 hours to get here and they still got angry because i didnt tip them
[2:30:02] KentavrZ: He is 0/3 he is mentally done I guess
[2:30:37] jojayjoo: I ask because Ive had restaurants where the person who took my food order didnt even serve me and I barely saw them the entire night but they expect a tip
[2:30:41] hsmoothstone: hsmoothstone subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:30:52] thikona: @jojayjoo there are restirants that saves up the tips and split them on all employes

[2:31:31] Ironicusx: wtff
[2:31:34] xdverad74x: @jojayjoo sometimes restaurants split all tips amongst the servers, but usually servers earn their own tips.  but servers are also typically in charge of tipping bussers/foodrunners
[2:31:36] Ironicusx: D:
[2:31:37] grounnnd_: Hmm
[2:31:38] erowerlord: bruh
[2:31:48] kirbee___: Herald took the demolish
[2:31:49] SkyeBeeb: @jojayjoo Examples 1: All tips are yours, no sharing. 2, Everyone pools in their tips and divides equally. 3: All tips are pooled and different amounts are given to all staff based off your roll in the restaurant with the front of the house getting more than the back usually
[2:31:49] bioniclebob: The fk was that HUH
[2:32:00] maxah333: he was just a bit more angry than other shellys

[3:27:58] Liquid211: Would probably be bad business for Riot Games to admit that there is a thing called losers queue KEKWlaugh
[3:28:11] ImBoredAndHungry: Do it
[3:28:29] cyankshs: smolder is crazy good imo
[3:28:56] Galkaria: so we can't believe riot at their word there's no losers queue, here's hoping we believe them that vanguard won't fuck up your computer or "fix hackers"
[3:29:45] Liquid211: YEah kinda makes sense. I see where you are getting at,
[3:30:01] friendlycrackdealer: but i feel like that's malicious on their part because they refuse to fix the matchmaking.  or maybe its just difficult to fix in the right way, iunno i guess KEKW
[3:30:16] Komiitkaze: not morde top?
[3:30:16] friendlycrackdealer: they also refuse to reset the ladder.

[3:31:20] Red_Fr0st_: Smolder all over them, Wings Kreygasm
[3:32:16] friendlycrackdealer: so i guess my question would be if refusing to reset the ladder and refusing to fix matchmaking isn't malicious, what is it? just incompetence? or something that they cant fix?

[3:35:41] Rockefeller_usa: @Wingsofdeath hows smolder top?
[3:37:07] Liquid211: @friendlycrackdealer It could be something about how the matchmaking is implemented and how deep it goes that Riot Games simply cannot fix it with out reworking it entirely and since they dont think that their matchmaking is broken, they leave it as is.
[3:37:31] eneffdee: cool skin

[3:39:56] Liquid211: @friendlycrackdealer Yeah sure or a combination of both. Didnt they recently lay off a good chunk of people? And the game will generate goo revenue with skins and champions regardless of the match making since most people dont notice this.
