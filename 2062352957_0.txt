[4:16:42] NicVilll: losersq for coding
[4:16:56] NicVilll: 💺
[4:16:59] DesuLaDesu: @denunciator if the target number is 9, then in the array you check which two numbers in the array add up to 9, and then you return the indexes of those numbers
[4:16:59] ZABARUD0: 0,1 are the values in the array that add to the target value
[4:17:01] DesertZyra: those are the locations of the numbers
[4:17:02] ProfessionalDilettante: @denunciator 0,1 are the locations of the two numbers that add up to the target number
[4:17:04] denunciator: are you supposed to return A pair or all pairs

[4:18:33] Ghostloon: GAMBA
[4:18:34] Lazynameross: this ign doesnt ring a bell, who is this yone? monkaHmm
[4:18:36] FrothingKook: when in doubt, brute force first, optimize later
[4:18:37] Lazynameross: oh nvm
[4:18:50] Kiwiguard: Efficient: put all nums in a map with their indices stored too
[4:18:50] denunciator: @frothingkook SURELY I will do it later Clueless
[4:18:52] stgaeb: Can you create an array to store data in? If so, there’s a pretty easy linear algorithm.
[4:19:02] Lazynameross: the wizard bear nukes under turret Scared
[4:19:28] FrothingKook: nested for loop in a for loop to get the target addition of two indices. that’s if you just have to find the first time you add up to the right number

[7:34:21] Oracixn: ur damage is a bit insane
[7:34:22] colaaaaaddict: 33 Kills in 15 mins
[7:34:23] denunciator: this game shows that people who claim smolder is weak just need to git gud
[7:34:48] Lazynameross: idk if mejai worth

[7:35:53] Lazynameross: ire lol
[7:36:09] denunciator: yeah cause you do mainly physical damage and taric is an armor boi right
[7:36:26] denunciator: thats the main drawback of smolder i tink, FH wrecks him
[7:36:32] Ghostloon: MOOOOOMM

[7:40:05] bluegazer1: it was lag fr
[7:40:08] icehat_702: tswift says shake it off
[7:40:08] froggys1ime: its okay you're just giving them hope
[7:40:11] savvy_with_it: What are some of your favorite bot duo's w/ Ashe ?
[7:40:34] denunciator: cosmic is really stat-efficient and gives a bunch of stats that smolder really likes
[7:40:53] denunciator: like 40+ movespeed every time you hit a spell is crazy
[7:41:11] denunciator: at max level cosmic gives like 70 movespeed
[7:41:28] denunciator: or 90?
[7:41:28] bluegazer1: a-z when smolder banned O_O
[7:41:40] Deku_Dreaming: I think it's 60, no?
[7:41:40] colaaaaaddict: y arent they dodging your Ws
[7:41:45] Tirafan: zyra does that better xdd
[7:41:46] denunciator: @Deku_Dreaming 5% base right
[7:41:50] denunciator: so that by itself gives 30+
[7:41:58] Ghostloon: Asmolder - Zmolder
[7:42:04] denunciator: so true
[7:42:15] Deku_Dreaming: Oh, I was just thinking of the 60 from hitting a spell w/o considering the 5%
[7:42:23] denunciator: ah yeah it's 60 at base
[7:42:31] bluegazer1: mejais
[7:42:31] denunciator: but yeah i think cosmic on smolder could be a play
[7:43:09] Deku_Dreaming: I've been going HF first on Hwei, feels real nice
[7:43:39] denunciator: it's 600 regardless of targeting
[7:43:53] zokeoh: whats smolder auto range?
[7:43:58] Deku_Dreaming: 550
[7:44:05] zokeoh: oh wtf
[7:44:23] denunciator: the 600 counts from where you cast the spell
[7:44:42] denunciator: and yes smolder range is 550 so basically if they move a couple champ distances away
[7:44:57] zokeoh: @denunciator if u get rfc doesnt it proc on all qs
[7:44:58] denunciator: uh oh
[7:45:04] zokeoh: bc his Q range scales with rfc
[7:45:06] denunciator: uhh rfc only gives bonus range at max stacks right
[7:45:13] Ghostloon: mejais
[7:45:15] zokeoh: oh fr
[7:45:19] Lazynameross: yeah max
[7:45:21] denunciator: why no :(
[7:45:22] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[7:45:24] denunciator: cosmic so stronk
[7:45:25] bluegazer1: maybe lichbane is good?
[7:45:26] Deku_Dreaming: yeh, so every max range rfc q would proc it
[7:45:30] bluegazer1: 'nvm u have bloodsone
[7:45:33] zefanie1: rip mejai stacks
[7:45:38] Lazynameross: but lethal tempo is closer to what youre trying to do lol
[7:45:43] Hambenzey: just shojin or rift
[7:45:44] icehat_702: does e proc bloodsong by itself?
[7:45:49] bluegazer1: mandate or morello seems solid
[7:45:52] Lazynameross: and stuntCampfire
[7:46:03] denunciator: 25 haste 80 ap 5% + 40 movespeed
[7:46:08] denunciator: and hp i guess
[7:46:30] Lazynameross: e doesnt proc bloodsong but does liandrys
[7:46:46] denunciator: if you really want to style on them you can go a defensive item like Zhonya
[7:47:34] denunciator: this smolder champion has NO mana costs wtf
[7:47:44] savvy_with_it: is current smolder viable as pro play?
[7:47:51] colaaaaaddict: Cryptbloom
[7:47:58] icehat_702: ^
[7:48:09] bluegazer1: they got the 3x invuln comp

[8:22:59] syfhero: good morning how the games been
[8:24:07] Thommenius: Are you going to try singed again?
[8:24:17] jjennukka: S is not looking too strong
[8:24:20] kaiserwroth: riot intentionally makes fucked up teams to force a 50% win rate and force "engagement" with the playerbase by artificially making games unbalanced so people are forced to play for longer periods of time
[8:25:04] Yonaire: did u play zilean yet ? there is a grasp tech with max e
[8:25:14] ShaunTheSheepish: Heyo! :)
[8:25:25] bluegazer1: yeah i tried that warmogs grasp zilean, it did not feel better than ap
[8:25:32] archimedes_9: im pretty sure lehends played singed support in worlds too
[8:25:34] Yuckaholic: do you need damage for comet to proc?

[8:26:51] bluegazer1: https://www.op.gg/summoners/kr/%EC%B9%BC%EA%B3%BC%20%EC%8B%9C%EA%B3%84-KR1
[8:26:55] ShaunTheSheepish: @stunt You can sell your 1k stacked support item and rebuy it (will start at 900 gold and 3 wards). With the upcoming early game nerf but late game buff to Zak Zak, would it be worth going Celestial first and then swapping to Zak Zak late game?
[8:26:56] bluegazer1: this one of the guys playing it
[8:27:11] LesgoBR: was that cocabob?
[8:27:22] LesgoBR: when you switched tabs
[8:27:53] bluegazer1: i feel like frozenheart>seraphs would be ok
[8:28:07] bluegazer1: the warmogs rush felt like 0 mana
[8:28:24] LesgoBR: the seraphine photoshopped pics are from cocabob
[8:28:27] LesgoBR: am i crazy?
[8:28:28] Ghostloon: oh they're a Seraphine player
[8:28:40] Yonaire: grasp dmg i guess
[8:28:42] bluegazer1: yeah u get upgrade with dring+new stat shards+overgrowth
[8:28:46] bluegazer1: idk
[8:28:59] bluegazer1: i tihnk ap is just better but warmogs is impossible to int on so you get carried easier
[8:29:22] ShaunTheSheepish: @stunt I put my question a little bit further up in chat. It's not too long
[8:29:33] yonays: holaaa
[8:29:50] Ghostloon: holaaa eunice
[8:30:11] bluegazer1: you lose 160 gold on the sell, then gain back 100 gold on quest i guess
[8:30:12] Nightbot: follow me on my socials for updates!  linktr.ee/stuntopolis
[8:30:14] bluegazer1: seems fine
[8:30:14] ShaunTheSheepish: So you only need to restack 100 gold on it
[8:30:26] vogue_hommes: you don't need to stack any gold right now
[8:30:44] LesgoBR: i thought you could buy the already stacked item after completing the quest
[8:30:50] Yonaire: isnt that net loss ? XD
[8:30:52] Yonaire: in gold
[8:31:00] yonays: @Ghostloon hi julesssss
[8:31:01] vogue_hommes: it auto upgrades when you rebuy atlas
[8:31:16] bluegazer1: you sell for 240 gold, so 160 to switch rn
[8:31:33] vogue_hommes: the upgrade sells for 280 so it's really cheap
[8:31:34] FuzzelBomb: !az

[8:32:01] ryuksintern: thought on hubris rengar players
[8:32:04] vogue_hommes: ok
[8:32:15] ShaunTheSheepish: You cant swap it without selling it, right?
[8:32:17] vogue_hommes: you don't restack
[8:32:28] bluegazer1: dont think you can swap in shop, you just sell and rebuy atlas and it will let you choose final item again
[8:32:53] vogue_hommes: i've swapped it by selling, i didn't know you could just buy the other upgrades
[8:33:05] ShaunTheSheepish: Ah, that might be easier. I didn't know thay
[8:33:08] ShaunTheSheepish: That*
[8:33:26] bluegazer1: there was a swap for jg item i think

[8:35:35] bluegazer1: in practice tool if i sell fully stacked item and rebuy it give me atlas with 0/1000, i think thats bugged though. couldnt see way to swap in shop
[8:36:01] ShaunTheSheepish: @bluegazer1 did you try walking out of the fountain?
[8:36:13] macg10: u finished singed?
[8:36:27] Agarus_Exsolutus: it` a shen angle
[8:36:34] bluegazer1: wait i tried it again and it let me buy fully complete items,
[8:37:30] bluegazer1: you sell for 160 so 400-160=240 gold loss
