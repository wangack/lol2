[0:37:02] brunchmenus: brunchmenus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! A cloud weighs around a million tonnes. A cloud typically has a volume of around 1km3 and a density of around 1.003kg per m3 – that's a density that’s around 0.4 per cent lower than the air surrounding it (this is how they are able to float).

[0:39:04] Kennyl4d: Cowsep there is a problem, I cant copypaste that long cloud message here, there is a limit of 500 characters
[0:39:40] nickthevictory: @NeppuNeppuNee The weight of a cloud is not directly affected by its altitude in the sense of changing the total mass of the cloud. However, the altitude of a cloud can influence its density, size, and characteristics, which indirectly affect its weight.  As a cloud ascends to higher altitudes in the atmosphere, it may encounter lower temperatures. This can cause the water vapor within the cloud to condense into water droplets or freeze into ice crystals, depending on the temperature. The form
[0:39:49] nickthevictory: @nickthevictory Conversely, as a cloud descends to lower altitudes, it may encounter warmer temperatures, causing the water droplets or ice crystals to evaporate back into vapor. This reduces the overall mass of the cloud while potentially increasing its density.  Therefore, while the altitude itself does not directly change the weight of the cloud, it does influence factors such as temperature, condensation, and evaporation, which in turn affect the cloud's density and characteristics.
