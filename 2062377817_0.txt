[5:51:17] QtDivinity: @LaMzes yes because your rank will far outpace your mmr when you win
[5:51:44] LaMzes: depends on how you do your wins and loses

[5:54:09] PPPingu: How would EU SoloQ specifically be fucked and not other regions
[5:54:10] LaMzes: but they never had anything to step on in terms on quality
[5:54:17] QtDivinity: idk everyone playing whos the biggest loser is just dumb the game as a whole has shit ranked/proplay outside of very few LOL

[5:54:34] LaMzes: and they haven't done a hard reset
[5:54:40] LaMzes: from the time it got fucked

[5:55:35] LaMzes: from turkey got transfered from EUW
[5:55:45] LaMzes: and they didn't have a system to prevent transfer mmr fucking normal mmr
[5:55:50] LaMzes: people were getting challenger with 20% winrate
[5:55:51] benq1338: well dota stole the game concept from league and made it worse
[5:55:51] mrsmeowmers01: 1vs1 game usally have a good mm system
[5:55:52] benq1338: so idk
[5:56:04] LaMzes: I had a syndra in my team
[5:56:07] LaMzes: 800lp EUW
[5:56:08] QtDivinity: @LaMzes the big issue was when people figured out the transfering issue
[5:56:09] LaMzes: with 18% winrate
[5:56:10] LaMzes: from 90 games
[5:56:22] Trenoxe: everyone who cares about cs plays on 3rd party matchmaking though
[5:56:28] QtDivinity: you could bug abuse transfering to reset your MMR entirely and just keep doing it until you had insane placements
[5:56:38] ProGameZ: maybe winrate is not main thing
[5:56:40] Trenoxe: true alkXD
[5:56:41] baueshhh: !playlist
[5:56:41] Nightbot: usually various youtube trance mixes from luminosity or tiesto
[5:56:43] LaMzes: then people found out fresh account abuse with normal
[5:56:45] QtDivinity: and people were getting challenger with insane games
[5:56:52] QtDivinity: gains*
[5:56:57] Ghost_of_Dividion: league is like pringles once you pop you just cant stop
[5:57:12] QtDivinity: pretty sure cs added some sort of matchmaking that fixes that need
[5:57:12] baueshhh: is this the nyana tiesto mix?
[5:57:15] QtDivinity: but I could be wrong
[5:57:18] LaMzes: yamatosdeath is a good example
[5:57:21] ilgasolous: you are wrong
[5:57:21] ProGameZ: even in old CS 1 the real matchmaming was in FACEIT
[5:57:23] LaMzes: of what a fresh account can do
[5:57:24] ilgasolous: cs2 mm still shit
[5:57:34] QtDivinity: Not saying it isnt shit
[5:57:43] QtDivinity: I was just saying I dont think people use face it still or do they?
[5:57:44] ilgasolous: the game is good but mm still shit
[5:57:49] ProGameZ: Just play FACEIT like S1mple
[5:57:50] Juanzary: hasnt cs public mm been as for ages ?
[5:57:57] Ghost_of_Dividion: hes busted
[5:57:57] ilgasolous: i mean i play faceit
[5:58:02] QtDivinity: They added some shit called premier i think
[5:58:06] QtDivinity: in cs2
[5:58:11] bleeeeds: Valorant is just a better game now imo
[5:58:12] QtDivinity: aww gotcha
[5:58:12] LaMzes: the main issue with public mm on cs was cheaters mainly, no?
[5:58:19] LaMzes: pretty sure every single game in normal MM cs
[5:58:20] QtDivinity: No
[5:58:22] LaMzes: had cheaters in it
[5:58:24] ilgasolous: ye premiere sounded so good
[5:58:28] QtDivinity: you could literally queue into globals
[5:58:29] x_Scy: f2p game in fps is cheating invested always
[5:58:31] QtDivinity: as a fucking silver
[5:58:32] QtDivinity: aswell
[5:58:41] Ghost_of_Dividion: theres still cheaters in faceit and all the private leagues
[5:58:49] apumaTV: Dude what the fuck is senna this patch  @LaMzes
[5:58:53] LaMzes: i mean ofc there are always gonna be cheaters
[5:59:03] apumaTV: just qued up and hit enemy adc for flat out 1000 damage with my ult
[5:59:04] Ghost_of_Dividion: welcome to league
[5:59:06] LaMzes: but i prefer getting a cheater 1/5 lobbies
[5:59:08] LaMzes: instead of 5/5
[5:59:13] Juanzary: dont wanna get exiles to the beach KEKW
[5:59:13] ProGameZ: nice acc name ICANT
[5:59:20] Juanzary: truue
[5:59:21] R3Vid: i need like 15min to get into a game recently
[5:59:30] LaMzes: PoE has cheaters?
[5:59:31] ilgasolous: league has cheaters xdd
[5:59:33] LaMzes: auto dodging or what
[5:59:33] apumaTV: This song Pog chills man
[5:59:40] Juanzary: you just have to ignore it and play on
[5:59:40] Pike2K_: everytime i try to enjoy cs2 i just always end up back to valorant FeelsOkayMan
[5:59:40] QtDivinity: League is getting vanguard
[5:59:41] LaMzes: Valorant also has cheaters
[5:59:42] bleeeeds: yeah vanguard is goated
[5:59:42] QtDivinity: in two months
[5:59:50] apumaTV: PoE Has BEen cheating KEKG
[6:00:01] apumaTV: BEeN cheating classic
[6:00:04] PPPingu: Riot just doesnt care, scripters get reported and tickets get sent on obvious scripters but they do nothing abt it
[6:00:09] Ghost_of_Dividion: wont need anticheat if shitters didnt cheat
[6:00:15] ilgasolous: yea val's anticheat is really good cuz vanguard can see everything on your pc ddx
[6:00:18] QtDivinity: League getting vanguard is gonna be LIT imo scripting has gotten alot worse the last couple of years
[6:00:37] Juanzary: testing new apex season now, to bad its so aa favored ><
[6:00:46] apumaTV: I'm going to be honest i think league matchmaking is fine. This season it's specifically bad for lower elos, but it will get fixed
[6:00:49] x_Scy: can we start having good clients before we put vanguard in this shit of a client?
[6:00:55] musti_a: DIESOFCRINGE
[6:00:58] QtDivinity: @imexile have you seen what scripts look like in league? LOL
[6:01:04] snerpaderp: shit person
[6:01:07] benq1338: xdx
[6:01:10] apumaTV: the problem is that the game is so unfathomably filled with gamebreaking bugs that you literallly can't play a game without encountering one
[6:01:15] QtDivinity: it's comical how insane they've gotten
[6:01:16] musti_a: @QtDivinity can you link it?
[6:01:17] Tamsu: why would you script on vayne
[6:01:17] Nightbot: because its the best
[6:01:23] Raufal: why would you want last pick as smolder huh champ gets first picked every game
[6:01:31] Pike2K_: i've seen scripters still manage to lose games in league xdd
[6:01:34] MiniZabell: One singular game, 6 hours later PepeLaugh
[6:01:35] Sil3ntShowman: I am not cheating but I have Disabled Vanguard
[6:01:38] QtDivinity: scripting as vayne/kalista/kogmaw/twitch
[6:01:44] QtDivinity: were generally the best adc script users
[6:01:48] NiNoX14: Vanguard will be perma on on your pc by default and you cant change that
[6:01:48] musti_a: @QtDivinity not the script btw just a video so i can see what it looks like LOLW
[6:01:49] ravvau_: just holding spacebar
[6:01:56] Tamsu: could just play ez and hit every skill shot
[6:01:57] QtDivinity: @musti_a I can find one uno momento
[6:01:58] LaMzes: so now
[6:02:01] LaMzes: we do the GALIO

[6:02:17] QtDivinity: kassadin Prayge
[6:02:20] Sil3ntShowman: Bug abusers are similar to cheaters
[6:02:20] QtDivinity: KEKW
[6:02:21] apumaTV: Qiyana is generally a good matchup vs akali
[6:02:24] NiNoX14: Galio is easy
[6:02:34] QtDivinity: exile if you want the actual giga tech garen is a crazy pick here
[6:02:36] LaMzes: Then we doooooo
[6:02:37] Sil3ntShowman: I have seen bug abusing since season 3
[6:02:40] strawberry_nerd: Galio is easy, you just press abilties 4Head
[6:02:40] LaMzes: the renekton tech
[6:02:43] NiNoX14: Lock galio he plays himself

[6:07:00] Sil3ntShowman: @Juanzary If you play Path of Exile with that kind of servers is kinda worse to play the other mental asylum of League of Legends
[6:07:03] LaMzes: not the worst trades tbh
[6:07:54] LaMzes: she can't walk up like that after 3
[6:08:00] QtDivinity: Holy she took the e

[6:17:22] palabam: xdd you have too much farm compared to akali so you get a bounty
[6:17:33] Sil3ntShowman: @LaMzes 160 cd for his ult is too long to say the least
[6:17:54] LaMzes: no it's not :DDD
[6:18:00] LaMzes: you can't have that kind of ult on a low cd
[6:18:20] Bassofia: Why not? Range is not global lmao
[6:18:20] Nightbot: because its the best
[6:18:38] LaMzes: you should usually do walk -> W -> E -> Auto -> Q
[6:18:44] Bassofia: Lux can have a gigalazer ever 20 seconds, why Galio can't fly and help teammates every 60?
[6:18:45] Pike2K_: free game EZ
[6:18:57] Sil3ntShowman: @LaMzes didn't say for 80 sec but 120 would be good .
[6:18:59] LaMzes: or wait, walk -> W -> E -> Q -> auto
[6:19:17] LaMzes: now ult is huge range
[6:19:21] Sil3ntShowman: @LaMzes YEP that's a good combo
[6:19:23] Bassofia: Still not global
[6:19:34] Bassofia: No reason for it to have such high cd
[6:19:45] LaMzes: legit the reason is
[6:19:47] LaMzes: it's half the map
[6:19:50] LaMzes: it gives a shield
[6:19:55] LaMzes: i knocks up everyone inside the circle
[6:19:57] LaMzes: and it gives dmg
[6:20:03] LaMzes: does dmg*
[6:20:07] Sil3ntShowman: If it was global the cd would be reasonable
[6:20:14] LaMzes: but if you're good
[6:20:18] LaMzes: it's as good as global
[6:20:28] Yattho: nope they changed it
[6:20:29] yoozecc: not anymore
