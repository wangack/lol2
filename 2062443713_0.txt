[1:21:34] Challenjord: adam you have to think of stuff you want to do differently that you failed to do in previous games youre just going into games cluelessly and afking through the game mentally. Try give away only 3/4 deaths, make sure you perma spam where enemy jungler is, jg tracking is huge  anything like this is rly helpful
