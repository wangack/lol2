[0:38:04] jcgleissner: for the ability damage increase was the idea
[0:38:05] omme_12: XDDD
[0:38:07] stevvve: last season u couldnt go shojin and navori at the same time right
[0:38:20] ADCPurple: including ajck
[0:38:22] ADCPurple: jack

[1:08:24] Celici: @besseralsihralle spideraxe on twitter, it's his W though, so it doesn't matter too much. But AD is changed from total AD to bonus AD while explosion gets higher AP ratios. OVerall  champ is straight nerfed

[1:11:23] ADCPurple: i like shojin RFC
[1:11:50] RironVN: Given that early levels you stack a bit slower ofc @matic1414
[1:12:11] Tcyy: why do you get more stacks mid lane considering you only hit one guy mid and two guys bot
[1:12:22] therealpilsner: if she ults it doesn't matter if you're closer
[1:12:29] therealpilsner: she will run janna down until she uses e
[1:12:31] ToneDoLOL: Because support fucks stacke

[1:17:01] Tcyy: it feels off that his Q isn‚Äôt an activable like Garen etc even tho it works with RFC and counts as an auto
[1:17:04] xcalebur: pro player lying to us
[1:17:21] xcalebur: bro if twitch did that do you not think youd see him in pro play stevvve
[1:17:39] stevvve: @xcalebur his early and mid game is too bad for pro
[1:17:41] ianathealpha: min 18 execute, holy amount of stacking that happend this game
[1:18:14] amshash111: why is zeri so good in pro play
[1:18:23] maverick12: How does ult works looks like it deals no damage?
[1:18:30] itsLetterP: and insane skill ceiling

[1:19:01] john57n: So why noone plays trist adc?
[1:19:20] ToneDoLOL: Smolder is safe but I play like him a kalista that may be the reason I keep losing
[1:19:21] aloneinthedisco_: everyone pressing r and running over you :D
[1:19:25] Celici: But next patch you're probably forced to take W points, so less safe
[1:19:26] N3v3rr3form3D: @john57n shes better in mid
[1:19:44] maverick12: @N3v3rr3form3D Ok thanks

[1:20:15] amshash111: is there any point stacking past 225
[1:20:24] jcgleissner: @amshash111 DAMAGES
[1:20:34] RironVN: @amshash111 Your damage + execute range goes up

[4:20:33] ADCPurple: i had the same, i saw a podiatirist about it. It might be the way you walk and run. make sure your technique with how your foot is coming off the ground is correct or it causes pain in the achilles tendon @Jackspektra
[4:20:50] 970_Keo: hola jack BloodTrail BloodTrail BloodTrail
[4:21:17] mitchxyou: tristana taking a hike OMEGALUL

[4:24:22] JekeDano: also simpler things like how u sit
[4:24:24] ADCPurple: yeah it took me so long to walk correctly on my left foot

[4:46:10] shiny00: i have a question  im struggling alot in my eu emerald elo and i often find myself useless only trying to survive as adc  and sometimes i cant win lane harder due to my sup  what can i do ?
[4:46:32] Kinteshi: uninstall the game
[4:46:42] goozithegreat: just dont play adc
[4:46:48] ADCPurple: emerald is elo hell unlucky
[4:47:27] bajdasen: in other words play support
[4:47:31] Arbucks: I will simply just blame David 'Phreak' Turley
[4:47:33] lattestream: i definitely slipped into that mindset, I do feel it's cope but I think there's some truth to adc having by far the least agency in solo q
[4:47:35] keanzlol: @Jackspektra how do I change this no-agency mindset? I feel like I started to think like that lately
[4:48:13] shaavola: At how many solokills as ksante makes game unplayable?
[4:48:33] itspegi18: that's also what works for me
[4:48:37] shiny00: but when i go this route and i put that pressure on myself  then i end up feelin the world on my shoulders

[4:49:43] faker1376: When you have a bad day and a losing streak, do what Faker did: turn off your PC and take a break!
[4:49:49] DonaldMungchi: @ADCPurple none of the 3 champs you mentioned are shit
[4:50:03] ADCPurple: zeri jinx aph are not good
