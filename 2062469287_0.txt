[0:47:55] razer_mon: Brackken*
[0:48:07] bolivianheat: ipav is secretly planning a trip to bolivia so he can party at the disco tecas
[0:48:34] Brackker: @razer_mon ipavLick no idea what that is
[0:48:54] razer_mon: KEKL
[0:49:13] razer_mon: search up Lethal Company its a horror game
[0:49:17] Brackker: shit, I wish I could go to a Colombian disco party
[0:49:30] Brackker: Kreygasm
[0:51:20] DeS1Gn3D: Yo tengo muy diñero mi amigo
[0:51:58] bolivianheat: you know what south america doesnt do? diaper spa’s.
[0:52:42] Brackker: I dont think I want to know what a diaper party is and Im afraid to know
[0:53:14] Brackker: diaper spa I mean
[0:54:08] bolivianheat: google new hampshire diaper spa, they pushing to open a diaper spa so 45 year old pervert men can shit themselves in front of women for a robust fee
[0:54:33] bolivianheat: colombia would never
[0:54:35] Brackker: omg WutFace
[0:56:15] bolivianheat: i first doscovered it through the tim dillon poscast. tim believes north america should actually lean in heavy into diaper spa’s, build one in New York even, and then force the migrants to work at said diaper spa…. that will surely drive the migrants back to their homes
[0:56:43] lemmentoteemini: annie top? Pog
[0:57:18] bolivianheat: if pedro is changing the diaper of a 45 year old male pervert….. pedro is prolly thinking “ya know venezuela wasnt so bad, i didnt NEED to eat every day…. im going back!”
[0:57:54] Seeerial: That hunk of a man, ipav999, is an E-sports athlete? Unbelievable. He could be a Calvin Klein model. Or a pro footballer with a ripped physique like that. That is by far the hottest Cyber sportsman to ever grace the esports industry.
[0:58:02] LetTheScoutCook: Im thinking about prioritizing every skirmish possible in my proximity, cuz i feel like top has no impact on game if I dont.. i can have 10cs per minute, crush my top and still lose my games
[0:58:05] lemmentoteemini: KEKW
[0:58:35] LetTheScoutCook: low dia is all random fights.. noone cares about ending the game
[0:58:46] LetTheScoutCook: so i have to kinda play along

[2:10:37] Pitju99: I think aphelios shoulda done mote lazer om, just based on the amount of MR they have
[2:10:49] Pitju99: later on
[2:11:35] Pitju99: also have you seen the buffed kraken ipav?
[2:12:03] Pitju99: pretty significant imo though possibly not good enough
[2:12:08] Pitju99: for everyone
[2:12:21] Pitju99: I mathed it out it's buffed for most of the game
[2:12:52] Pitju99: I'm not a 100% sure let me check
[2:13:05] Lescanya: 14.3
[2:13:26] Pitju99: oh it is in
[2:13:33] Pitju99: yep
[2:13:49] Pitju99: I did the math with nashor only it's a buff
[2:13:57] Pitju99: it's buff until 3-4 items
[2:14:12] LetTheScoutCook: SpiderAxe posted patch notes for 14.4 on X
[2:15:10] Pitju99: not saying its good enough just that its higher damage early to midgame
[2:15:14] Pitju99: i think ad is still bad
[2:15:41] LetTheScoutCook: teemo passive is worth 500g 1000g 1500g 2000g at 1.5.10.15 lvls
[2:15:48] Pitju99: well idk if its good just that it should be a lot better now
[2:16:04] Lescanya: practice tool time again
[2:16:16] LetTheScoutCook: ap nasus
[2:16:43] LetTheScoutCook: ap nasus saves him in early game vs teemo right?
[2:17:05] LetTheScoutCook: so he has free early
[2:17:23] LtChezo: tank teemo ipavChad
[2:17:41] Pitju99: rookern taimo MODS

[2:20:25] lemmentoteemini: for fun ap I guess
[2:20:29] LetTheScoutCook: i wish they showed how much dorans healed/dealed
[2:20:54] KSKmalza: is he sirchez?
[2:21:04] Pitju99: I think ppl would be really mad if they saw how much dshield healed each game lol
[2:21:12] Pitju99: insane item
[2:21:12] Kenwood502: Sirchez LUL
[2:21:36] lemmentoteemini: yh it is lul
[2:21:41] Kenwood502: I figured had to be playing AP nasus lol
[2:21:51] KSKmalza: its him lol just check
[2:22:38] Kenwood502: quite the matchup we have in store :D
[2:23:07] LetTheScoutCook: I m going to make test in practice tool. what is the best way to outsustain AP nasus
[2:23:15] Kenwood502: Doran shield good into it though 5head
[2:23:41] LetTheScoutCook: i would go rejuvination rune tho
[2:23:47] xNostalgiax: does doran shield stack if you buy 2?
[2:23:49] LetTheScoutCook: the extra little bit hp after laning phase doesnt help here
[2:23:59] Pitju99: @letthescoutcook that rune doesnt scale at all, also can only buy one doran item
[2:24:28] Pitju99: I like dring with fleet second wind
[2:24:33] LetTheScoutCook: vs ap nasus u want to prio early as much as possible.. he outscale anyway
[2:24:56] Pitju99: @letthescoutcook no but rejuvination rune is really useless on teemo believe me
[2:25:01] LetTheScoutCook: ok
[2:25:44] LetTheScoutCook: fleet vs ap nasus would be also better imo.. u get pushed anyway so phase rush is not valueable
[2:25:57] Pitju99: Alan says matchup is a fleet proc fest just gotta watch out for all in
[2:26:10] LtChezo: tankmo ipavChad
[2:26:10] LetTheScoutCook: ye makes sense
[2:26:21] Pitju99: Rookern MODS

[2:28:00] LetTheScoutCook: im about to cry soon
[2:28:10] Pitju99: if this is not a rookern game nothing is
[2:28:24] docelover: @LetTheScoutCook stop trolling
[2:28:48] Downroar101: it just means ur rank was inflated
[2:28:58] xNostalgiax: does AP nasus have a good all in? or does he just E spam?
[2:29:08] LetTheScoutCook: man i made d2 on like 4 accounts.. i think im fine
[2:29:15] LetTheScoutCook: that elo is just insanely random
[2:29:23] OriginNanoSuit: oh thats Sirhcez
[2:29:28] LtChezo: yeah this stream is really hard to watch tbh, but i persevere
[2:29:32] Pitju99: @xnostalgiax he kinda just spams E until he falls off and becomes squishy
[2:29:45] barbolarbo: tankmo = global taunt NOTED

[2:39:49] Pitju99: it might be riftmaker

[2:44:42] JayeLau: of course they knew it was you
[2:44:45] Pitju99: can clickbait with sirchez too
[2:45:02] lemmentoteemini: ad nasus would've made game harder
[2:45:11] Pitju99: agree
[2:45:22] kenshiro199X: Check DMG received from champs
[2:45:33] JayeLau: he would have been kited
[2:45:34] LetTheScoutCook: stat checker
[2:45:47] Pitju99: they would still lose but it would be a bit harder
[2:46:11] LtChezo: check mitigated
[2:46:26] kenshiro199X: Teemo tankeddd gj
[2:46:35] Pitju99: you tanked as much as nasus
[2:47:03] Pitju99: maybe more
[2:48:16] UBAYAYE: chill gameplay good
[2:48:30] LetTheScoutCook: check his dmg?? lock in nasus and equip dummy with teemo items .. and poke E on it
[2:49:01] LetTheScoutCook: try to use teemo passive 5s as timer for consistency
[2:50:08] Pitju99: yeah rageblade has synergy with items, but as a standalone it got buffed by a bit
[2:50:43] Pitju99: it doesnt scale with AD either
[2:50:50] Pitju99: it just scales with level
[2:51:11] Pitju99: also check lvl 10 damage cause they buffed that the most, early kraken
[2:51:40] YolkBun: catRose happy valentine mr ipav
[2:51:41] Pitju99: went from 85 flat to 140
[2:52:04] YolkBun: catRose @chat
[2:52:34] 291x: @YolkBun catRose
[2:52:52] Pitju99: yeah might not be for teemo
[2:53:04] Pitju99: but it was not great before so thats why
[2:53:34] Pitju99: sorry I put it wrong
[2:53:44] Pitju99: it is 45 so 45 to like 160
[2:54:04] Pitju99: its way more even if you account the scaling lost
[2:54:10] Pitju99: early on
[2:54:39] Pitju99: it is 40-50 dmg more I think
[2:55:08] Pitju99: at least
[2:55:55] Pitju99: new one is 174
[2:55:56] Pitju99: yep
[2:56:22] Pitju99: it is a lot stronger as a rush item now and still scales ok
[2:56:32] Pitju99: until lategame its still better a bit
[2:56:36] Pitju99: than it was
[2:56:45] LtChezo: well thats the point of kraken now, its a rush item to snowball
[2:56:45] Pitju99: like 4 items or more
[2:57:02] LetTheScoutCook: Im doing ultra deep testing to determine what runes are best for 5s window trade Teemo gets when exiting passive.. I ll let you know
[2:57:17] coldbrunette: ggs was raka last game
[2:57:28] Pitju99: it scales well too
[2:57:35] LtChezo: you wouldnt get it 2nd at that point its not worth i think
[2:57:36] Pitju99: not really worse than it used to be
[2:57:39] Pitju99: just a big buff
[2:58:05] LetTheScoutCook: ye but every dmg counts so i will make sure its 100%
[2:58:40] LetTheScoutCook: try to test stuff around 5s passive .. it gives good consistency
[2:58:57] LetTheScoutCook: and u can proc passive easily on laning
[2:59:05] Pitju99: against squishy top that builds MR
[2:59:11] Pitju99: this can deal a lot
[2:59:20] Pitju99: against tanky top still bork better
[2:59:28] LetTheScoutCook: teemo passive is 500g gold efficient for every 5lvls
[2:59:38] Pitju99: kraken against stuff like MR stacking ADC or bruiser?
[2:59:44] Pitju99: or assasin

[3:00:10] LetTheScoutCook: rageblade wins in 6 attacks+
[3:00:15] Pitju99: if they stack MR its even stronger
[3:00:27] Pitju99: in comparison
[3:01:03] LetTheScoutCook: dont forget the slow lets u put out one more attack atleast
[3:01:21] Pitju99: no but first purchase
[3:01:23] LtChezo: well in longer trades the kraken dmg ramps up doesnt it
[3:01:28] Pitju99: they might go mr component
[3:01:35] Pitju99: they dont know u will go kraken
[3:01:46] LetTheScoutCook: dont forget terminus value is in its defensives also
[3:01:47] Pitju99: so first back negatron or mercs
