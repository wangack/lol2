[0:06:33] Seeerial: That hunk of a man, Santorin , is an E-sports athlete? Unbelievable. He could be a Calvin Klein model. Or a pro footballer with a ripped physique like that. That is by far the hottest Cyber sportsman to ever grace the esports industry
[0:06:51] TheGesterr: I went from Kha'zix onetrick to a Seraphine onetrick, some people have weird champ pools lmao
[0:07:03] dalepax: Hey Santorin, seeing u building sunderer into cleaver with lee sin, would u build the same when ure smurfing or would u go full ad?

[0:23:36] Greatsire23: Im high emerald/diamond currently and see Zac every game I swear. He's played so much
[0:24:01] TheGesterr: it's wild to me that it's even possible for Jax to lose to Twisted Fate when his E counters TF's entire kit
[0:24:02] Kraysys: good morning
[0:24:21] rexxarhero4: massive throw holy

[0:55:03] Zady: bye domo
[0:55:05] TheGesterr: their parents are probably too powerful, more than Faker, that's why they don't play League to give everyone a chance

[1:06:16] Zady: lee is having a bad day
[1:06:44] Caendred: @santorin maybe you already explained it but why do I feel like so few high elo junglers take future market and hate going into debt? The accelerated power spikes seem like one of the best things in the game and I take it almost everytime

[1:23:17] teamyyyyyyyyy: chillin chillin how are you
[1:23:38] guiltyprawn: Zac monkaS
[1:23:49] blubbubb: I feel like the most important thing about jungling is TRACKING
[1:23:52] blubbubb: there you go
[1:24:04] TheGesterr: I'll be honest, I was gold as jungler but jungling IS hard and that's a big reason I swapped roles and champs to climb
[1:24:28] TheGesterr: anyone who says jungle is OP and easiest to climb with is not real
[1:24:49] puckad_: I really want to main jungle. But in s14 I just find myself lost with all the options. And especially when to farm and when to teamfight
[1:25:02] blubbubb: oh absolutely, but to use one word to summarise it imo would be TRACKING in a very broad sense of the word
[1:25:38] TheGesterr: just go Wit's End santorinEZ
[1:28:13] blubbubb: wouldn't you say that's the fascinating thing about this game?
[1:28:33] blubbubb: we play it for hours and hours on, every day, for years, and somehow we still wanna keep playing
[1:28:44] blubbubb: very few games have that nowadays
[1:31:02] TheGesterr: solo kill before he even tp back is HUGE for Ori
[1:31:45] TheGesterr: mid kingdom
[1:32:03] Furiusl: wait,why ori 2 kills and ryze 1 death on tab?
[1:32:15] Furiusl: oh is bc he dont show, now is 2 deaths
[1:32:19] puckad_: What do u think abt grubs btw? Is it worth prioritazing over drag or just denying 2 grubs and getting 1st drake?
[1:32:39] blubbubb: if you don't have pushing lanes, I don't see much use for the grubs
[1:32:47] blubbubb: but that's just my humble opinion
[1:32:48] TheGesterr: LOOOOOOOOL
[1:33:03] Furiusl: hahaha

[1:59:08] TimeWizardLuL: then u get australian english teacher
[1:59:08] bierhell: Du sprichst Deutsch?
[1:59:17] elliot_orme95: I have mad respect for anyone who can event string a sentence together in 2 languages. i'm british and like 90% of people only speak english
[1:59:25] getsometalentloser: @santorin  between nidalee and Lee who’s actually worth time invest ment
[1:59:51] getsometalentloser: @elliot_orme95 brown sauce or red
[1:59:52] underc0very0: zeig mal wie gut du deutsch kannst
[2:00:00] elliot_orme95: @getsometalentloser red brown is ass
[2:00:06] guiltyprawn: I studied English from elementary to high school. 10 years. Swedish and russian middle to high school. 6 years. kaypTeach
[2:00:18] TheGesterr: Spanish BASED
[2:01:03] Floeey_: i mean english is mostly enough but i kinda wanna learn a third language like korean/spanish/japanese or smth
[2:01:14] ImAlwaysVitaL: i really want to learn french

[2:01:50] HAYB3AR: Just listen to OOMPH
[2:01:59] madgym02: the maximum gap is crazy lol
[2:02:05] Floeey_: the funny thing about german is that german has a word for everything like wanderlust
[2:02:14] petermeterkneter: Messi die Ziege

[2:02:46] Boh14: ivern
[2:02:50] OPDonQuixoteTFT: kayn
[2:03:39] TheGesterr: it's true, I'm Puerto Rican and my Spanish is so rusty, I can still understand it but I can't speak it nearly as well and it's kinda embarrasing too
[2:03:48] sebastianminiatures: but you would shit on them in the jungle :p
[2:04:05] Kraysys: its alright, you're fluent in LA-lish and LoL-talk now

[2:16:14] Falcnation: i gotta make over 150 heart shaped pizzas at my job today lol
[2:16:33] Funkyyfrog: what do void grubs do? @santorin
[2:17:28] HAYB3AR: @Falcnation santorinCheers santorinCheers  GL
[2:17:56] sebastianminiatures: @Funkyyfrog xp, gold, bonus tower damage, if your team gets 5 or more you summon little void boys when you hit turrets
[2:18:49] HalfmanDaan: @Minimancer27 void boys might be the cutest ever
[2:19:15] ChicoLoLxD: but adc is such a weak role omegalul
[2:19:26] koolaidking456: botlane lane feels the worst role in the game right now
[2:19:34] Burgerbrater1702: to be fair varus movement was sick
[2:19:40] koolaidking456: go play bot you’ll see lol
[2:21:45] PigeonSenti: it's crazy how you gap every jungle and are always up cs/objectives but i doesn't seem to matter much most of the time
[2:21:57] TheGesterr: COPIUM
[2:22:00] Falcnation: i think its not who's weakest, its just which team has the most people gapped loses. a top/mid gap will still beat a sup/ad gap but just one lane vs the 2 bot lane they win
[2:22:06] Burgerbrater1702: @koolaidking456 COPIUM
[2:22:17] koolaidking456: my bad lol yes sup is broken lol
[2:22:17] ronaldoo: bot its broken i agree
[2:22:24] OPDonQuixoteTFT: since i switched to support i climb very fast
[2:22:45] Falcnation: Im a whole tier higher this season as a support main lol
[2:22:45] koolaidking456: adc feels so bad tho bc if you don’t space perfect you’re instantly dead lol
[2:23:10] neurobrick: I am an adc main and I hate playing adc
[2:23:14] neurobrick: this is correct
[2:23:18] ChicoLoLxD: support can solo jungler
[2:23:32] Burgerbrater1702: hahahahahahaha
[2:23:38] Trotter_1515: LOL
[2:23:47] blubbubb: I remembere Quantum (he's a Challenger midlaner in NA) said that adc is the most difficult game to climb; to quote: "you won't climb playing ADC, it's impossible"
[2:23:48] ImAlwaysVitaL: dude rift mechanics are so bad, no way someone tested that and said it felt fine
[2:23:54] OPDonQuixoteTFT: this new herold is just a meme
[2:24:08] Trotter_1515: Atleast it's giving entertainment value, unfortunately at your expense xD
[2:24:09] ChicoLoLxD: new herald is so bad compared to old herald
[2:24:19] neurobrick: @blubbubb it’s not impossible but it’s very hard
[2:24:21] hillrammus: @koolaidking456 yeah but then your direct opponent is eloinflated by adcs being along with supports by far the worst players in the game
[2:24:22] PigeonSenti: the new herald feels so fucking bad compared to how tanky and strong it is
[2:24:26] ChicoLoLxD: brohan is a streamer too
[2:24:28] ChicoLoLxD: i believe
[2:24:30] Burgerbrater1702: its yas/yone onetrick
[2:24:40] Burgerbrater1702: twotrick* lol
[2:24:43] scubasteve932_: was noc banned this game?
[2:24:47] blubbubb: @neurobrick his words, not mine. but I agree, it is very difficult
[2:24:48] PigeonSenti: it deals no dmg to towers and it can't even break platings anymore
[2:25:30] scubasteve932_: Gigachad
[2:25:37] AGamePH: Brohan is a Yas and Yone main I think
[2:25:39] neurobrick: @blubbubb because your role depends on another role just to get out of laning phase, and then you have to pray to god that the rest of your team hasn’t inted it by then
[2:25:48] bonusdmg2noobs: BUT, new rift herald has no chill.  +1
[2:25:49] ChicoLoLxD: @PigeonSenti it feels like it loses all its health on charge
[2:26:26] blubbubb: @neurobrick I main Kalista, trust me, I know the pain haha XD
[2:26:28] megilino: GM guys had bad dream  :( up early
[2:26:41] ChicoLoLxD: u guys griefed i fear
[2:26:50] neurobrick: @blubbubb playing kalista in low elo is the worst thing ever
[2:27:37] blubbubb: @neurobrick well yeah... but I like the champ too much, she's just too much fun. fell in love when she was released and that hasn't changed since
[2:27:56] neurobrick: yeah I play her a bit too
[2:27:57] hillrammus: @blubbubb yeah he's challenger (half the time) because his winrate bot on Swain and Ezreal is so high. His wr against challenger midlaners is below 50 %
[2:28:27] blubbubb: @hillrammus oh is it? I didn't know that, sorry
[2:28:39] hillrammus: no flame I really like quantum and he's a good player even better streamer. But he's another example of botlane being an inflated role
[2:28:44] ChicoLoLxD: ummm
[2:29:15] blubbubb: no no that's a good point @hillrammus no flame there at all, no worries. :)
[2:29:58] TheGesterr: time to play TP/Smite Viego
[2:30:21] Azucrias: Whats your opinion on brand after the nerfs? @santorin
[2:30:25] ChicoLoLxD: do you have to take on the enemy champ's form as viego?
[2:31:23] PigeonSenti: listen to some ABBA to boost morale
[2:32:18] Brockerto: gimme gimee gimee you farm
[2:32:53] mtvmort: gm (in us) hope games are going well

[2:35:22] getsometalentloser: can’t remeber the last time I’ve seen a streamer win with a zed on their team

[2:39:46] TheGesterr: YEP

[2:51:28] getsometalentloser: how’s vi this patch
[2:51:31] SuperPinkMonkey1: how do you choose which jng item to start?
[2:51:44] mavwag: what kayn skin is that
[2:53:38] TheGesterr: I remember for the longest time Vi was considered really really bad and one dimensional and now she's a permanent meta staple jungle
[2:54:26] basik: is eclipse worth rushing? it seems like an OP item
[2:54:31] TheGesterr: can't wait for Warwick to get the Arcane treatment when Season 2 airs in a few months
[2:54:50] TheGesterr: Santorin gonna unleash THE DAWG in him
[2:55:30] gojibudha: sky feels so strong on vi
[2:55:40] rvend: even if they nerf Vi damage she's still a good champ because her kit is so good, imho
[2:56:19] jonasthr1: @rvend yes you can just go tank and ult the adc
[2:56:33] rvend: @jonasthr1 yeah
[2:56:49] TheGesterr: I wish Vi could mid, she's such a fun champ
[2:56:54] rvend: if they want to nerf vi they have to nerf her utility

[2:59:59] basik: does main character syndrome get worse at higher elo?
[3:00:25] SuperPinkMonkey1: had to sub went on a crazy win streak after watching you jng
[3:01:37] ImAlwaysVitaL: what the fuck
[3:01:37] crucialbessi: ?????????????????
[3:01:38] crucialbessi: wtf
[3:01:43] kairin_: I think I remember viper saying that Vi is  one of the champs that are harder to play unless you’re better at the game
[3:01:43] vileb123: saving fourth shot for next fight
[3:01:52] ImAlwaysVitaL: that is crazy
[3:01:55] OPDonQuixoteTFT: he forgets that he gets movementspeed when he AA

[3:11:12] vivalylol: There's still (some) hope! Don't get discouraged
[3:12:35] crucialbessi: been having these type of games forever.. so frustrating
[3:14:44] OPDonQuixoteTFT: why is heimer sup not a thing anymore btw?
[3:15:54] OPDonQuixoteTFT: didnt maokai got nerfed this patch? he has still 54 winrate o.O
[3:16:25] MrDiscen: @santorin is it even possible to climb to master/challenger as a support solo queue player?
[3:17:41] blueknight0007: Then i am either really bad as a support or my team griefs me too much cause im not climbing
[3:21:15] hillrammus: the reverse is also true. I win jungle, enemy jungler can get randomly inted back in to the game by my shittier lanes. Can I challenge crap, objectives, invade, gank or do anything? All depends on laners skill levels and decitions not my own. I allways put it like this, jungle have the most agency in solo queue and 99 % of it is given to them by laners
[3:23:09] The_Posh_Panda: oh, banger
[3:23:10] Griefclaw: makes it team based but still no voice comms which is annoying now u cant solo carry as hard
[3:23:34] OPDonQuixoteTFT: thats what i loved on playing call of duty... u could clutch 1v5 easily if u were better :D
[3:23:55] The_Posh_Panda: I'm one of the people that thinks comms would be terrible for league
[3:24:05] ImAlwaysVitaL: yeaaaah i dont think i like that
[3:24:17] jblol94: lie!
[3:24:26] Dylonce: voice comms would be amazing
[3:24:28] Dylonce: like valorant
[3:24:30] Euheimr: people would just be toxic over voice
[3:24:40] Griefclaw: as oppose to not being toxic now kek?
[3:24:45] Dylonce: you coulda told ur aatrox to calm the fuck down last game
[3:25:03] Griefclaw: the amount of mentals i could save being jung and saying things like dw bro coming top soon
[3:25:26] jblol94: if that swedish girl can hit rank 1 in arena season after season on wow then you can win without voice in lol
[3:25:42] OPDonQuixoteTFT: with voice chat u could carry every game as a pro with your calls. that would be unfair af :D
[3:25:43] Dylonce: voice comms would be so fun
[3:25:49] Dylonce: better clips for tik tok
[3:25:53] Griefclaw: pog eve
[3:26:09] Dylonce: you can't duo?
[3:26:10] The_Posh_Panda: voice comms grandmaster+ I really don't want voice comms in diamond and below
[3:26:26] The_Posh_Panda: duoq was abused hard for boosting in high elo
[3:26:26] Dylonce: thats sadge
[3:26:26] ImAlwaysVitaL: thats rough
[3:26:46] Ch0ppedSushi: Your support has teleport
[3:26:51] antisuji: team game... but you must play alone.
[3:26:56] Dylonce: rito is making us cry
[3:27:15] hillrammus: just be worse at the game Lucas. You can duo in diamond :)
[3:28:36] OPDonQuixoteTFT: anybody knows if its  true that you fck your mmr by playing duo?
[3:28:47] Luxuriuc: Bring Back 3v3 !!!!!!!
[3:29:09] solidussovis: I get why you can't duo over diamond, but doesn't that just increase high elo players having smurf accounts so they can still enjoy the game with friends?
[3:29:45] Euheimr: Gayge
[3:30:07] The_Posh_Panda: this playlist is full of bangers
[3:30:15] ImAlwaysVitaL: i still kind of hate that flex is a thing, is there really a massive problem with stacks if you just force stacks to play against other stacks? surely there are more than enough ppl to be able to do that
[3:31:05] solidussovis: Santo easily has the best playlist on twitch. Followed closely by KP
[3:31:55] nyxos101: What do you think of the Lethal Tempo nerfs coming?
[3:32:27] blueknight0007: yeah i like your music choices too
[3:33:20] solidussovis: Feels like RIOT punishes you for being good at the game
[3:33:22] shadow7master: once i herd he played kensas carry on wayward son i knew he has good taste of music
[3:33:26] sebastianminiatures: eve to rank 1
[3:33:43] ImAlwaysVitaL: oh my
[3:35:02] solidussovis: That is totally why I don't climb. I like duo que. Definitely not just because I'm bad at the game.... santorinQ

[3:37:53] Burgerbrater1702: ur e dodge kinda scripted
[3:37:54] Burgerbrater1702: ngl
[3:37:59] arthalie: Eve has been pretty solid in solo queue for a while now, the TSM subreddit last year was surprised we picked up bugi and he never got to play eve since he was basically an eve one trick for years
[3:38:53] hvn1k: tempo reclal
[3:38:55] nyxos101: What do you think of the Lethal Tempo nerfs coming?
[3:39:10] shadow7master: eve is like rengar vs good players they cant play the game
[3:39:40] solidussovis: No point of being invisible if they aren't seeing the map
[3:39:55] arthalie: I'm just sad fiddle is in limbo where he's too good to get buffs but not strong enough for competitive
[3:40:28] Cptluc: Completely inted and made the most clutch W
[3:41:06] pumsy1: @nyxos101 a good thing for laners imo
[3:41:06] arthalie: Is the smolder playing the crit build or the shojin Riftmaker build?
[3:41:16] worldparadise420: evelynn got a secret buff
[3:41:22] pumsy1: @pumsy1 nerfing yone and yas top llaners
[3:41:51] shadow7master: mejais is a trap Aware
[3:41:52] solidussovis: @arthalie There are a lot of champs that are unplayable or broken nothing in between. Look at all the Ksante nerfs. He will be broken until he isn't playable
[3:42:44] OPDonQuixoteTFT: voice chat diff
[3:42:48] Cptluc: Why are ppl playing so weird, what was Riven planning there?
[3:42:49] arthalie: @solidussovis you're absolutely right
[3:43:17] Cptluc: that takes forever!
[3:43:17] Griefclaw: haha eve is so gross in soloq
[3:43:29] Report_Baron: evelynn is the way for rank 1 now

[3:44:26] pumsy1: the fact that this champ has an extra flash is like brokennnnn
[3:44:28] Cptluc: raba with mejais
[3:44:48] Cptluc: BOMBA
[3:44:52] orep__: Bomba
[3:44:55] arthalie: Shadowflame? Not sure if the crit effects the execute threshold on ult
[3:45:13] cant3r: 1k g for the gromp
[3:45:21] Gameboy736: think so, gragas didn't have the mark on him
[3:45:23] Furiusl: gromp fatter than gragas
[3:45:34] shadow7master: i knew it mejais always been a trap xdd
[3:45:45] Mooslim123: took too long to hit him?
[3:45:46] solidussovis: Gromp > Gragas it was calculated
[3:46:08] arthalie: Or should it be shadowflame so you oneshot someone and they provide some utility?
[3:46:10] Cptluc: +4
[3:46:28] arthalie: Cryptbloom* not shadowflame wtf am I thinking
[3:47:03] solidussovis: Bloom does seem good here
[3:47:21] Cptluc: I have the feeling that mid-season the quality of players in all elos drops so hard
[3:47:48] C0nk1: 100% kp still
[3:48:35] arthalie: I didn't know there was a twitch in this game 😂
[3:49:20] basik: you greeded the ult
[3:50:03] solidussovis: again totally calculated. We know it Santo
[3:50:15] Cptluc: senna has lasthit the dragon twice missing 6 souls
[3:50:18] Cptluc: for no reason
[3:50:23] Cptluc: in high-elo
[3:51:34] spectreOO8: ask him?
[3:53:29] getsometalentloser: I feel shadow flame would of been better then stormsurge
[3:53:32] khoajsp: edge doesn't work well against eve
[3:54:02] Griefclaw: clean flash
[3:54:12] pepego2: ??
[3:54:19] PhenomenalPower: stormsurge is ass
[3:54:35] cant3r: it's too nerfed
[3:54:46] arthalie: Stormsurge is just kinda meh on melees in my mind, it's really good on Zoe and Sandra, and akali but that's because akali is hyper mobile
[3:54:50] danokrez: was so good before they nerfed it rip
[3:54:55] Grimcreeper2025: Grimcreeper2025 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months!

[4:12:45] ImAlwaysVitaL: like graves e i guess
[4:12:51] Nikolajnb: is zac supp a troll?
[4:14:22] arthalie: @onlygoesham he doesn't really want to have to move back and forth, he's said he'd be open to coaching remotely but he's been a part of rosters with remote coaches and it didn't feel great.
[4:15:33] Dntspeedup: santorinFine santorinFine santorinFine
[4:15:50] Burgerbrater1702: bc gets buffs next patch I swear lee sin getting buffs from everywhere

[4:22:22] nwa4lifeTV: 1 death every 2 minutes a bit sus
[4:22:25] Zeiik101: he's useless until he gets ult
[4:22:33] Zeiik101: he's lvl5 still
[4:22:39] shadow7master: thankfully shaco drops late game
[4:23:01] KyCerealKiller: the fact that you are still trying to win this game is a big difference between us. id have given up already
[4:23:19] jamoun_: xdd
[4:23:51] shinma___: did aatrox read the shutdown attempt?

[4:36:55] arthalie: I feel like Tiamat plus having a 3k smite if you time your e,q,smite to all go off at once is really powerful at objectives

[4:37:03] 흑색지체: HAHA
[4:37:21] 흑색지체: hit me with 19 ads

[5:20:08] auri_sariel: I am here for the jawline too
[5:20:08] soki34: if you play him with the right build you can 1v1 ANY champion even with less items. 6.5 sec CC combo
[5:20:17] solidussovis: if you have a choice to be a Harry Potter style wizard or a star wars jedi what do you choose?
[5:20:19] arthalie: It would still be awesome to get reunion streams with other retired pros apex with bjerg and dyrus
