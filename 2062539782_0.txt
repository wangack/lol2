[0:28:14] watson1235: I’ve started streaming relatively regularly for my friends and a few more people are starting to tune in but the game isn’t popular on twitch and I don’t use anything other than chat to interact. I don’t have any expectation and I just like doing it. it’s fun.
[0:28:22] Jazzoholic: eyooo we're in the same cosy sweater-mode <3
[0:28:22] HAYB3AR: @l4zyL3gz kaypComfy kaypVibe
[0:28:28] iphame7: @FeedTheTank you should stream bc you want to entertain and share it, not do it to get recognition and all, it's nice ofc, but shouldn't be main goal :D
[0:28:33] Darkcyter: @Jazzoholic kaypHello
[0:28:45] megilino: CANADA!!!

[0:29:58] Darkcyter: @Sunnytinker WB
[0:29:59] iphame7: I do think if you want to stream and got noticed you should play a game that's relatively new, for instance when palworld launched, people are then looking for streamers to watch, popular games already have all these people with their name out
[0:30:04] Darkcyter: @The1997wiki kaypHello

[1:06:40] JaygarciaSaturn1: I lay bricks
[1:07:02] bluesiies: what age did you start streaming?
[1:07:03] VanillaEssenceLoL: but I guess no one will have a better interest in your future than you
[1:07:22] FrostySupreem: predictions
[1:07:44] inSINwetrust: Doing the math now Kappa
[1:08:12] FrostySupreem: mods predictions?

[1:08:43] FeedTheTank: @KayPea look at it this way, you did all the hard work to get here, why should you now, pawn off the leg work to someone else just because your succesful?
[1:08:45] damndani_: you're good with people so i can see that actually
[1:08:49] VanillaEssenceLoL: but I think even from contract perspective, you could get extremely ripped off by management teams, social media managers tend to take 50% which isn’t really fair compared to normal main stream management of 10%
[1:09:04] TooSmoll: what about merch? Do you have some, or are you thinking about making one?
[1:09:21] flipthenmomboom: york? u were a toronto mans?

[1:10:00] Mayveda: @KayPea I mean.. u're capricorn girl, you'll be (atleast) good at anything u put ur mind into
[1:10:04] VanillaEssenceLoL: the tie die hoodie
[1:10:08] bragismuse_scathach: lots of streamers/ YouTubers place all their bets on videos and not consider something to fall back on
[1:10:11] sergioelhermoso1: Hey kay

[1:13:35] Jefrienaiter: Nice move
[1:13:40] carlton_dry: did you use to play with sivHD back in the day or different person ?

[2:16:20] xBoomShotBaby: Hate Kayns kaypLunaRage
[2:16:22] KatV9: also i think if promo games were still in the game half the players wouldnt be there
[2:16:26] xayria20: IU feel like low elo players have great mechanics they just lack in game knowladge and objectives
[2:16:26] tylerarcen: FrankerZ100
[2:16:44] shedfirekid1: i miss old runes and masteries because it allowed for diverse problem solving based on the needs of the gamew
[2:17:54] S17Master: Big
[2:17:54] inSINwetrust: I was diamond 1 in league during season 5, I think. Maining Ziggs. But I left the game for years and came back now but do not play ranked anymore.
[2:17:55] tylerarcen: @kaypea Your Ahri is good. 🤙🏽
[2:17:58] TomNova: yeah i agree with that, like if you were feeding or something playing "off meta" but sometimes you can play well and people are still upset
[2:17:58] KatV9: BASED KAYPEA BIG W
[2:18:06] xBoomShotBaby: I love when they stay around as well
[2:18:11] Hymuno: the problem with climbing is consistency, I can play like a plat player. But only one game a week LUL
[2:18:12] xdemitricx: Are you going back to na?
[2:18:14] tylerarcen: Cheer100
[2:18:24] lizzyberry22: i know you for the birb!!!
[2:18:33] lizzyberry22: mostly cuz you're like the only person i watch who plays her
[2:18:42] MelonDestiny: birb is so fun
[2:18:43] via_trita: sorry for the repeat question but do think i heard the answer if there was one: okay, so its been about a year since i played, did they do a map facelift?
[2:18:54] wizzlet: yes
[2:18:54] crussster: this kda chorma is TOOOO good😭

[2:19:40] jimbob_ywert: how do you reach emerald? I’m stuck gold
[2:19:55] KatV9: the amount of elo inflation there is unreal
[2:19:55] lizzyberry22: demolish takin that turret
[2:20:08] MissUnfortuneK: smolder players are even the best playeers or the worst
[2:20:15] n1vlem: very good trolls vs complete new people vs high elo smurfs
[2:20:19] lilCACTUSS9: Elo inflation is my fav new term
[2:20:25] wizzlet: the amount of master - chally players playing with plat and em players in flex is wild
[2:20:32] inSINwetrust: Let her cook
[2:20:45] GalaxyzQueen: LET HER COOK NOW
[2:20:48] KatV9: can admit i have passed there a few times on my smurfs already and although i do win its quite interesting macro wise in emerald
[2:20:48] Afcb89: let the artist paint !
[2:20:51] Niomah: I watch you and I watch Zwag because you play what feels good or what seems interesting to you instead of being slaves to the meta.
[2:21:02] TomNova: dont see why not, get them tower plates :P
[2:21:13] nikkotari: Hellooo Happy valentines dayyy 💌 and omg u play ahri, I just finished my splash art for her
[2:21:20] sparkman347: aphelios mid is golden
[2:21:34] MissUnfortuneK: huge kp <3
[2:21:34] tylerarcen: @kaypea 🪁 is what makes or breaks from low to mid elo. but also a good duo helps. 🍺 cheers.
[2:21:36] agrox89: Yesterday my Top Laner picked Jinx because he couldnt play bot so he decided to use a bot in top lane... it was a rough game
[2:22:09] d4vidrry: troll
[2:22:20] paksmen: hello, happy Valentine kaypea
[2:22:25] MissUnfortuneK: everyone now plays tf mid :s
[2:22:31] tylerarcen: meh
[2:22:33] metoyetu: metoyetu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:22:34] HijiBlade: its nasus he said ff at 15 eariler
[2:22:58] XRedmartyrX: Rough
[2:23:01] xBoomShotBaby: BibleThump
[2:23:08] wizzlet: meanwhile bot lane is 2 mid while three bot
[2:23:15] lilCACTUSS9: And I can't hit either when someone is usi9ng ghost
[2:23:15] Niomah: I've watched Zwag play pretty much every champ in every lane. It can be done, as long as it's done with counters in mind
[2:23:22] lilCACTUSS9: using*
[2:23:32] MissUnfortuneK: renata does a lot of work
[2:23:38] tylerarcen: @kaypea any thoughts on sobriety?
[2:23:44] xBoomShotBaby: I dont understand why ppl keep playing Smolder, he seems very weak
[2:24:02] wizzlet: took ur bot lane a whole 1 min 30 sec to rotate bot after u lost tower and died in the fight
[2:24:13] nikkotari: @xboomshotbaby he is acutally really good
[2:24:26] quark978: ap on-hit scaling is brutal sometimes
[2:24:28] MissUnfortuneK: @xBoomShotBaby not really if he stacks he is so strong
[2:24:40] tylerarcen: good kill
[2:24:55] nikkotari: @missunfortunek exactly
[2:25:12] Niomah: The trick to smoulder is starting doran's ring and W to wave clear and q farm your stacks
[2:25:15] tylerarcen: @missunfortunek stacks n kills eh
[2:25:35] MissUnfortuneK: @tylerarcen kills are op in all champs frendo :)
[2:25:37] wizzlet: You hit the charm but she already had so many stacks of e in you
[2:26:39] wizzlet: annoying when u play well and ur team still feeds ur laner
[2:27:07] tylerarcen: @kaypea what’s the key to playing Ahri well pre 6?
[2:27:49] MissUnfortuneK: kp do you think that dark harvest works on ahri?
[2:27:56] tylerarcen: @missunfortunek fair. I’ve never played smolder just watched videos.
[2:28:11] wizzlet: tyler focus on q and w pokes till 6! when u w and auto someone it procs all stacks of foxfire
[2:28:27] jimbob_ywert: ahri not that good atm
[2:28:30] xBoomShotBaby: kaypUpsetti
[2:28:40] tylerarcen: @wizzlet 🤙🏽
[2:28:59] Fairlight_Excalibur: The Jungler's Association thanks you for your contribution fairTroll
[2:28:59] wizzlet: anychamp is good in the right hands lets be honest
[2:29:00] MissUnfortuneK: @jimbob_ywert true
[2:29:22] TorqueBandit: thats what he said
[2:29:59] MelihBravery: hi everyone
[2:30:43] MissUnfortuneK: lovely mechanics
[2:31:18] Sniipesttv: general rule of thumb nasus is always gonna split push considering 1500 stacks he can literally three tap a tower
[2:31:22] jimbob_ywert: it’s not that Ahri is terrible, it’s just that she does bad against many of the meta champs rn which are very popular
[2:31:25] VanillaEssenceLoL: apologies I have to leave but hope you and Lucas have a lovely evening kaypLove
[2:32:08] shedfirekid1: gg :(
[2:32:27] johnny479: Hiiii everyone kaypPengu
[2:32:55] tylerarcen: @kaypea you did well early on
[2:33:03] Sniipesttv: the way I see it if nasus can focus farm early game for the stacks the. once you got second even third armour item help the team fights cause you can get those same stacks on farm from dead lane to get those stacks
[2:33:07] Probross_: !followage
[2:33:07] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[2:33:34] jimbob_ywert: teamwork? pft, what’s that? I’m 1v9
[2:33:55] arcadedani: is like they dont understand they arent fucking someone else game they are trolling their own game like dude wtf?
[2:33:58] giveittomebaby1337: !followage
[2:33:58] Nightbot: click on your name in chat to see how long you've followed for kaypComfy
[2:34:05] Sniipesttv: for real tho some games be like that 0 teamwork cause everyone thinks they are the carry
[2:34:10] motta95: gg
[2:34:13] 00bonta: kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti kaypUpsetti
[2:34:30] Bendalfz: Teamwork makes the dream work LUL
[2:34:46] jimbob_ywert: some players need a league break
[2:34:59] wizzlet: smolder rotations sucked
[2:34:59] xBoomShotBaby: It was definitely winnable, but some of ur teammates kaypTroll kaypHUH
[2:35:02] FrostySupreem: Kels what are your thoughts of the New ranking system?
[2:35:09] Niomah: A lot of League players have an entirely middle school mentality.
[2:35:55] RecaapTV: The best way to play league is not expect anything from ur team and dont play around ur team tbh
[2:36:03] call_me_teaa: Remove emerald and we good
[2:36:05] jimbob_ywert: Low elo is mainly playing with your team BUT in a way where you rely on yourself more. teamwork in low elo sucks, which is why solo carry champs are much more popular in low elo rather than in pro play.
[2:36:07] call_me_teaa: for reals
[2:36:23] tooashty: just follow the jungles lead for objectives naturally it will lead to a better scaling
[2:36:29] percytalula: nahhh…. but like when you go in and your team doesn’t trust you and then don’t follow that also sucks….. so expecting nothing from them is also bad
[2:36:34] jimbob_ywert: like for example, Shens really bad in low elo, but in pro play shen is one of the best champs cus teamwork exists
[2:36:37] Niomah: I am already ready for this week to be over
[2:36:45] FrostySupreem: Why would they add extra Rank Elos??
[2:36:47] tylerarcen: 👋
[2:36:55] FrostySupreem: Why add emerald and other shit
[2:37:08] tylerarcen: Cheer100
[2:37:16] tylerarcen: lata
[2:37:25] Suzusa: kaypArrive  your hair is pretty today <3
[2:37:36] jimbob_ywert: I think playing around objectives is the best way to secure a win in this game. if you’re ahead, it MOST of the time secures your lead, but if behind, it also helps you make a comeback. soul is super important and so is baron
[2:37:46] Sniipesttv: it’s are the worst for that it a lane is failing and they get banked in they jg but ur trying farm up and flame you for them engaging anyways
[2:38:04] Sniipesttv: jg
[2:38:06] Sniipesttv: ***
[2:38:18] giveittomebaby1337: @VanillaEssenceLoL yeez your voice is kinda one of the million, you should make a living with it
[2:38:24] Niomah: Grubs are way more important to get or stop the other team from getting than most people seem to grok
[2:38:25] jimbob_ywert: MANIFIA
[2:38:26] wizzlet: Go hwei
[2:38:48] jimbob_ywert: BIRB FOR THE WIN?
[2:38:50] d4vidrry: hwei
[2:38:53] Sniipesttv: Neeko game!!!
[2:39:02] paulskies_: hi KP! love the new hair!
[2:39:10] MissUnfortuneK: maybe ziggs?
[2:39:15] wizzlet: Vex?
[2:39:24] milorambaldi87: as a twitch main, dont feed the twitch! lol
[2:39:25] nassimiheb: and we love it
[2:39:26] Hymuno: is neeko even suggested as mid anymore?
[2:39:27] paulskies_: well it looks very good! lol
[2:39:28] Sniipesttv: neeko in my top three and there nothing funnier then scuttle running out of river and messing you up on drag set up
[2:39:33] FrostySupreem: I hope they dont add more elos next year and just leave it as is
[2:39:49] DeepInCryo: i do the same to sion, but with trundle
[2:39:50] jimbob_ywert: Neeko is one of the most broken champs (to play or to main) because she has 100% outplay potential and usefulness behind or ahead! I recommend picking her up again!
[2:40:11] nassimiheb: large part of the team, he is literally large
[2:40:11] DeepInCryo: nothing more satisfying that sion ulting straight into a trundle pillar
[2:40:16] MissUnfortuneK: kp did yoou ever play brand mid? is so op
[2:40:26] paulskies_: i use zoe into ori they always walk up to throw ball lol and i bubble xD
[2:40:45] edooby: kp has never played brand...especially not jungle
[2:40:50] jimbob_ywert: We need to bring brand back!
[2:41:04] jimbob_ywert: @edooby you sure about that?
[2:41:09] nassimiheb: i am brand main, playing it  nowsupp, jgl mid lol
[2:41:10] FrostySupreem: man you havent played Brand in forever
[2:41:13] Sniipesttv: brand is another highly broken champ again
[2:41:14] xBoomShotBaby: We need some brand gameplay kaypCheer
[2:41:16] steelxdawn: BRAND is also a jungler now too  .
[2:41:16] MissUnfortuneK: we want brand <3
[2:41:17] jimbob_ywert: KP doesn’t even know who brand is smh 🤦‍♂️
[2:41:23] edooby: yeah, you were in love with brand
[2:41:30] piertotum_: brand used to be played mid old timess
[2:41:34] paulskies_: make brand great again
[2:41:43] MissUnfortuneK: he still can be played mid
[2:41:46] steelxdawn: BRAND = AN OLD FLAME
[2:41:51] Sniipesttv: I wouldn’t say best jg but ya know he alright
[2:41:52] BronzeLegends: omg i returned to leauge and see Kaypea still stream, you were one of the first people i watched on twitch back in the days
[2:41:54] edooby: wasnt that in like season 2 or something like that?

[2:42:03] piertotum_: anything can be played mid tho lol
[2:42:13] FrostySupreem: lol
[2:42:14] jimbob_ywert: Gotta bring neeko back, she’s also super fun to watch
[2:42:17] milorambaldi87: from an adc…..  nerf brand lol
[2:42:33] Sniipesttv: I cba when comes to going against a good Evelynn
[2:42:41] WWClown: do people that plays leauge for 10 years dont get sick of it?
[2:42:45] edooby: twitch = kinda toxic....pun intended?
[2:43:12] SneakyTheWalrus: Hi Kaypea I hope you and yours are doing well sneaky41Love
[2:43:21] BronzeLegends: @WWClown yea, i switch between WOW or maple when leauge get bored
