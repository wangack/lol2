[7:57:24] stu885: is it aatrox favored?
[7:57:27] angelo_g1: it's higher chance of you getting abducted and sold to the black market than play range top

[8:13:27] cheerios20203: @Naayil In high gm and challenger playing around weakside is almost impossible right? Like the enemy laner has to mess up big time for you to win lane which doesn't happen that often
