[3:26:37] armyparker91: expecially if you were to use him in low elo
[3:26:38] firemaster657: it can do good, but it can fall behind as well
[3:26:39] Holmegaard1: @Nightblue3 like 7 */10
[3:26:48] Satai2: very funny
[3:26:50] YordleTicklerOwO: You said his early was bad and late was better. It def looked like that this game.
[3:26:52] kiroctux: You need to use your Q less, in the meanwhile you cast Q you can do 2 autohits. Using Q mid fight is reducing your damage
[3:26:56] ZeBasterd1: I dunno man, I'm Jamgie to bussy

[3:27:47] WildTowelie: is this prerecorded? no one wrote that lol
[3:27:53] armyparker91: it doesnt seem crap just seems coin flippy again more so for low elo because you kind of have to rely on your team to chill and support you alot early game
[3:28:00] firemaster657: dang gg
[3:28:03] 67se: @ThatsNotGaming YEP too bussy
[3:28:05] cqry46: how many games?

[3:28:11] armyparker91: you have a high win rate because you are nightblue lol
[3:28:16] Fallen_Gabriella: I think TF has the ability to fail against hard, early ganks like the Nidalee from the earlier game proved. As long as you manage to scale mid -> into late game, you seem to do well.
