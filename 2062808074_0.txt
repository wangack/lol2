[3:41:45] mt113: youre a bad guy bob
[3:41:52] MillenniumBreakers: The most entertaining for me is when a streaming is struggling hard against a toxic lane champ, then he split pushes and single handedly wins the game

[4:09:35] g_grizz: like how does every single game on earth have voice comms other than this
[4:09:40] fragmasterbre: @ggarciapt ad has good clear and allows tactical kills to capitalize when u are already ahead without relying on landing skillshots. It is quite resilient to enemy compositions too
[4:09:41] mungpoo: he typed a slur LMAO
