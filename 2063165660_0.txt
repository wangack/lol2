[2:19:33] Sideshift: wings if you used to main nasus, and now are picking a new champion, what would it be?
[2:19:33] vonrazzle: feel like if youre gonna go red kayn, might as well just go play aatrox
[2:19:37] dexxtrall: even the red kayns i see just build blue items

[2:46:34] GarlicChampions: same
[2:46:37] TranZtion: So toxic lol
[2:46:41] DirigaazMaster: It's no Dark Lich theme but it will do
[2:46:43] Nindara: Remake was ass.
[2:46:57] ViewerNr3: Im too old to be young but too young to be old as fuck. I simply exist
[2:47:11] GarlicChampions: prob cause it was the same game with jsut an updated look
[2:47:22] Nindara: It was clunky as hell and felt cheap as balls. The remake of Trials was much better.
[2:47:29] GarlicChampions: yeah i didn't mind it
[2:47:55] Angry_Charrua: Next Poe league is 8 of March?
[2:48:23] Advesperate: they said end of march
[2:48:56] Advesperate: "We're currently planning to launch the 3.24 expansion in late March." 8th isnt late
[2:49:38] derpstevenson: Secret of mana remake sucked because the art style they chose was trash so it just felt worse to play than the original
[2:49:44] SmokeeTheBandit: no every league is considered an expansion lol
[2:50:26] dadminty: Kayn was inting but shit blue kayn damage is broken
[2:50:40] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[2:50:45] SmokeeTheBandit: but usually the end of the year adds some kind of end game boss but they didnt do that this year so it could be that as well
[2:50:46] thyvfhd: Your Jax work is my favorite
[2:50:50] Ferrhouse: Every other league is an expansion
[2:50:51] Nindara: What was stupid to me too was that SoM Remake had co-op like the original, so me and my friend was super hyped but the game was really not good. Then Trials came out, way better, but WITHOUT co-op. So strange.
[2:51:09] Alessyia: Alessyia subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 66 months! 
[2:51:21] Advesperate: They call every league an expansion by their word choice
[2:51:35] Tallantis: Surprise, Lee couldn't carry
[2:51:37] BurntTo_Crisp: How the hell did you win that one
[2:51:50] Advesperate: if you go to the page for affliction they call it an expansion
[2:52:11] Dipesto: no they don't, some leagues are called expansions cause they have new end game or reworks, if it's only a new league it's called new league launch
[2:52:19] Dipesto: wings is right chat
[2:52:28] Nightbot: @Advesperate -> Nightbot one, bad guys zero. [stop posting links] [warning]

[2:53:01] Advesperate: from affliction
[2:53:01] arhara_one: Conquers of the Atlas, Maven are the expansions
[2:53:11] dadminty: We need the dota system can’t you have a list of i dotn want to play with x player
[2:53:25] Komlin111: thats pretty smart, dont put to much stress on devs
[2:53:30] MadSpectre47: @dadminty Wings list would be too long lol
[2:54:16] dadminty: True that is true
[2:54:21] dadminty: Ya it would be absurd for sure
[2:54:24] dadminty: Abused*
[2:54:27] dravenmainxddd: did you play dota or hon before league came out wings?
[2:54:30] clockworkang3ls: Wings list would just be full of Geranimo accounts KEKW
[2:54:37] Vita51: think overwatch does that but you can only have two at a time
[2:54:41] Vita51: so you cant do that
[2:54:43] Komlin111: true @clockworkang3ls
[2:54:59] friendlycrackdealer: riot devs dont want that kind of work on their plates. they're busy.  Kappa
[2:54:59] Myatomicgard3n: dota has avoid list. for top tier the games are drafted teams
[2:55:15] dadminty: Yeah you right
[2:55:35] dravenmainxddd: wait wtf u draft people ?

[2:55:44] dravenmainxddd: so if someone is disliked they never play?
[2:55:47] Myatomicgard3n: top two ranks are captains. they pick from rest of lobby
[2:55:48] SpoonEngine: Fantasy Dota
[2:55:51] friendlycrackdealer: in case you guys dont already know, riot devs have the hardest jobs on the planet. Madge
[2:55:56] dadminty: There was the ai account it lost 60 games straight. They never farmed just ai at turret it’s still going.
[2:56:06] dravenmainxddd: ahhh i see
[2:56:08] Komlin111: FeelsBadMan
[2:56:09] dravenmainxddd: thats interesting
[2:56:22] dadminty: It non stop queued was placed in plat and was turbo losing to iron for 3 days straight
[2:56:38] dadminty: Just surprised it wasn’t banned
[2:56:40] dadminty: Is legit
[2:56:46] dadminty: Troll
[2:56:54] GarlicChampions: supposedly they said they can do IP bans when vanguard goes live we'll see
[2:57:07] VideoGameAfterlife: just get a new IP
[2:57:16] Komlin111: did you try the new skin?
[2:57:16] GarlicChampions: well "vac" ban whatever that means
[2:57:19] friendlycrackdealer: ip bans dont work
[2:57:40] Really_Wendi: people still cheat in Val lol
[2:57:45] Myatomicgard3n: @wingsofdeath so top two ranked are captains and other players can mark what role they want to play. then the captains alternate picking players. they can see their rank and what role they want
[2:57:47] Vita51: they choose what vanguard does really, they'll usually not immediately ban people just to gather info on the cheat
[2:58:00] GarlicChampions: almost never
[2:58:04] dadminty: Also I got kinda dumpstered by a Mundo as morde is that a bad matchup for morde or is it A I’m bad situation?
[2:58:06] Komlin111: I encountered a ton of bots
[2:58:07] Really_Wendi: I've never seen a scriptor
[2:58:09] raditz860: The Satoru Gojo Riven skin
[2:58:11] Vita51: i've never seen one
[2:58:14] OutRageousMe: all it does is make cheats more expensive because it raises the bar for the cheat devs
[2:58:19] Really_Wendi: @dadminty you can't ult him with his passive up
[2:58:26] GarlicChampions: i have seen yuumi bots in ranked games
[2:58:28] Komlin111: there are high elo scripters on oce
[2:58:31] Really_Wendi: and you ahve no way of breaking his passive outside of landing your shit E
[2:58:38] dadminty: Ya felt awful @really_wendi
[2:58:41] GarlicChampions: yeah i dont know why they exist tho
[2:58:52] GarlicChampions: why would someone make a bot just to play yuumi and afk on someone all game
[2:58:57] drachenkeule: I got 2 yuumi bots last season
[2:59:03] still_vektor: if that's zac top you should smooch him :3
[2:59:13] dravenmainxddd: i sent riot a ticket of legit evidence of a recording of someone scripting in my game, and they said they would look into it and the guy never stopped playing lol
[2:59:18] Vita51: they usually prioritize learning about the script/cheat over banning
[2:59:20] friendlycrackdealer: riot would be stupid to implement vanguard in general, in my opinion.
[2:59:33] Komlin111: idk
[2:59:34] Vita51: then when they can't learn any more or use it any more they ban
[2:59:38] underpressurree: no its not
[2:59:39] dadminty: This is a good sylas game
[2:59:42] Munnemun: YEAH!! no jax i did it

[3:06:53] friendlycrackdealer: oof
[3:07:02] Algosith: @Komlin111 sumerian
[3:07:11] MadSpectre47: that's kind of why Hieroglyphics are wild to me, they have circles and complex shapes and shit it's insane they carved that shit into stone walls
[3:07:15] IamKingSage: Couldnt type this earlier but Actually there is a video by Unity Research that explains why Riot Vanguard doesnt work. @Wingsofdeath
[3:07:37] MadSpectre47: what is that
[3:07:43] IamKingSage: Bro they just inted! lol
[3:08:42] MadSpectre47: Sylas went into a 1v4 lmfao
[3:08:49] Komlin111: @Algosith ic
[3:09:13] friendlycrackdealer: if yall had to pick a second language (if you don't have one already) what language would yall pick
[3:09:25] PunHok: why did cho have a shutdown?
[3:09:25] pandacaliburthesecond: Spanish

[3:09:53] Komlin111: even with target champs only?
[3:10:04] girthstory: hello wings how are the games today?
[3:10:06] IamKingSage: Mandarin Chinese, since I know english it would make it easier for me to learn the other symbol based languages.
[3:10:32] Zongo16: champion attack only toggle works for it if you don't push attack move with it

[3:10:54] MadSpectre47: is Sylas OK
[3:11:04] friendlycrackdealer: I'm split between Mandarin and German, tho I'm already practicing learning German.
[3:11:07] curlythanos: paypal received
[3:11:21] IamKingSage: from what I hear it is hard asf to learn mandarin as an english speaker only
[3:11:27] IamKingSage: so get the hardest one out of the way
[3:11:37] IamKingSage: then go easy mode on others
[3:12:03] ettore932: an actual jungler
[3:12:14] Ferrhouse: Do we care to carry him?
[3:12:19] MadSpectre47: why is Sylas sprinting
[3:12:22] friendlycrackdealer: yeah they said mandarin requires like 2200 hours of practice.  similar to japanese, korean and arabic.
[3:12:28] MadSpectre47: he's fucking turbo inting
[3:12:44] ViewerNr3: 50g cheaper but 5 AH less @Wingsofdeath
[3:12:52] Thruppy: isn’t 15 haste less than 10% cdr though ?
[3:12:58] MrFrappa: sylas averaging a death every 2 minutes
[3:13:03] MrFrappa: LUL
[3:13:49] ViewerNr3: @Thruppy  depends when you buy it. Your first 10 AH = 10% cdr, but the next 10 are not 10% cdr, as its linear scaling and not exponential
[3:14:09] Thruppy: @viewernr3 oooo right I thought it was flat my bad

[3:23:02] AiErain: make cho lose feast stacks again on death :)
[3:23:30] MadSpectre47: yeah just frame is like "i notice the enemy team has a fair bit of magic damage, can you explain why Merc's is a bad idea here?"
[3:24:15] ViewerNr3: questionmarks arent pack animals, as they say in Germany
[3:24:29] derpstevenson: Think the dude just didn't realize that tenacity doesn't reduce knock ups and what not

[3:40:47] AnonyNoob: Mundo v Darius isn't free for either side, but post-rework it got a lot better for mundo than it used to be
[3:40:52] dadminty: I guess ya
[3:40:55] dadminty: Can’t pull him in
[3:40:58] AnonyNoob: E cooldown is too high early to really use efficiently with his passive being a thing
[3:41:24] dadminty: That’s my low elo talking maybe it’s a free matchup for Mundo
[3:41:29] Z8246: seeing a lots of mundo lately, did he get buffed?
[3:41:29] dadminty: Forgot about his no cc passive
[3:41:40] Fyrok: try bork?
[3:42:03] AnonyNoob: Well. that's rough.
[3:42:09] AnonyNoob: @Fyrok On Darius? Absolutely not./
[3:42:26] Fyrok: might synergize with lethal tempo
[3:42:36] KentavrZ: I dont think he used ghost
[3:42:42] Apocolyspecloud: he ghosted to kill pyke
[3:42:45] Apocolyspecloud: its in chat
[3:42:57] AnonyNoob: @Fyrok Lethal is for early statchecking. Darius is not nearly auto-heavy enough for bork
[3:42:57] KentavrZ: Liars
[3:43:01] Lypek: he did i think
[3:43:08] derpstevenson: I bet he used it
[3:43:27] Apocolyspecloud: he had the haze around him when you watched him go on pyke
[3:43:27] AnonyNoob: WP Wings
[3:43:28] ragzzy: good shit
[3:43:35] Zeb: noice
[3:44:28] AnonyNoob: Darius is at his best when he stomps a 1v1, and then before his passive even turns off he gets another 1v1 to stomp. Unfortunately Wings plays in a real elo where that's uncommon
[3:45:40] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[3:45:51] Fyrok: yeah, i was thinking about bork procing on first auto now but that makes sense\
[3:46:28] dadminty: Smolder into Mundo seems like some free stacks
[3:47:15] AnonyNoob: A jungler? Being useful? Wings you're such a silly goober of a streamer
[3:48:13] Majmur: Burn his files
[3:48:15] bioniclebob: He need to pay top tax Kappa
[3:48:49] razertw1: Mundo outscales Darius right
[3:48:50] AnonyNoob: May have been able to get him off QFlash > R, but pretty risky
[3:49:07] KentavrZ: But the plate
[3:49:25] SASSlN: do u consider Darius as a lane Bully ? @Wingsofdeath
[3:49:29] AnonyNoob: @razertw1 Sorta? In a 1v1 Darius struggles at stopping him, but Darius is significantly more useful in a teamfight
[3:49:53] thikona: that was alot of damage
[3:49:54] solozocker: doesn't darius have a better late than mundo?
[3:50:07] solozocker: or at least a better teamfight
[3:50:08] dravenmainxddd: i feel like wings cs is always near perfect
[3:50:14] dravenmainxddd: o no
[3:50:23] KentavrZ: I actually think BORK would be ok here
[3:50:23] AnonyNoob: This do be some sexy cs numbers
[3:50:32] xKayzaa: Hmm
[3:50:32] ettore932: executioners?
[3:50:33] razertw1: I always thought Darius falls off
[3:50:35] AnonyNoob: DMP and Steraks are the go-to on Darius these days. Pick your favorite and then the other
[3:50:37] bioniclebob: Offensive flash with - dmg Kappa

[3:50:56] dadminty: Stridebreaker good on Darius or is titanic too good?
[3:51:00] solozocker: wait he has a cull
[3:51:02] dravenmainxddd: oh wow ur 1 win from d3 sheesh
[3:51:03] friendlycrackdealer: YesYes its fine
[3:51:18] AnonyNoob: @dadminty Stride's MS is now conditional and it has no AH. It's usable, but it's a lot worse than when it was a mythic
[3:51:21] dravenmainxddd: match history lookin nice
[3:51:44] Apocolyspecloud: kayn still hasnt transformed yet
[3:51:45] dravenmainxddd: damn its so hard to kill
[3:52:29] AnonyNoob: Mundo matchup does induce brainrot, can confirm
[3:52:39] derpstevenson: I find it so lame how much damage tanks do
[3:52:42] AnonyNoob: You just want to fight but without a lead that's kinda hard, midgame
[3:53:01] AnonyNoob: @derpstevenson Good thing there's no tanks in this match
[3:53:06] Absolutionism: does executioner 1st item help? dunno matchup
[3:53:20] matadoss: KEKW
[3:53:41] Apocolyspecloud: base form kayn imagine
[3:53:44] AnonyNoob: @Absolutionism Not worth unless his R is the difference in winning or losing the all-in, which is surprisingly rare
[3:54:05] AnonyNoob: Generally when it is the difference, it's enough of one that executioners won't matter anymore

[4:00:49] AnonyNoob: There's not really a good answer to this mundo tbh. DMP MS + slow resist would help with sticking to him, but a big chunk of his damage is magic, and syndra is also fed
[4:01:15] dadminty: Shop keeper diff in the mid lane
[4:01:24] dadminty: No lilandries and no rylais
[4:01:25] Ironicusx: i told u to not jinx it.. look at the jg u got now BibleThump

[4:02:48] dravenmainxddd: that r didnt do anything to mundo dang
[4:02:55] dravenmainxddd: thought for a sec you were gonna pop off on both of em lol
[4:03:17] kroova2: Wow that full stack ult did like 15% dmg to mundos up bar

[4:08:19] M0wgli: robertxlee
[4:08:35] AnonyNoob: Pyke by design just suffers from having a windup period on all his offensive skills. A syndra worth her salt can abuse that
[4:08:42] Jauneofarc: They don't e/ ult her first
[4:08:49] Jauneofarc: Pykes never do
[4:09:38] AnonyNoob: YeahNah I'm not saying he'd be balanced without it, it's just part of why syndra beats his ass. She can drop everything near-instantly
[4:09:54] AnonyNoob: Meanwhile he's a squishy so he just doesn't make it through it

[4:17:31] LightPulse21: I think he tried to mark her it just didn't have time to go off
[4:17:37] Majmur: Guess he wanted to gap close with minion and then get you with Q

[4:19:43] AnonyNoob: @GainzZ_TV Man I been debating getting Old God, but it's so hard to justify when I already got Dark Star and High Noon to spam
[4:19:47] AV_XXIII: swamp master kennen is the best skin BatChest
[4:19:49] dravenmainxddd: is morde one of your favorite champs ?

[4:31:43] AnonyNoob: Yep yep yep. Every single thing it gives is something that makes Morde big happy
[4:31:54] AnonyNoob: And then omni healing for full on AoE now is just the icing on the cake

[4:35:17] AnonyNoob: @derpstevenson Cries in that one Leona bug that sends her miles above the damned map

[4:35:40] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[4:35:44] derpstevenson: Pathfinder 2nd edition is so much better than D&D5 it's not even close
[4:35:59] derpstevenson: Pathfinder has actual game mechanics and tactics
[4:36:22] blue2327: Well that's just like your opinion man
[4:36:24] O_Hell_Yeah: he’s actually right
[4:36:26] derpstevenson: I played 5e for years before switching
[4:36:29] Advesperate: PF 2nd edition is to D&D like POE is to D4.
[4:36:30] sartrik: pf2e is actually really good
[4:36:35] Majmur: KEKW
[4:36:36] Dainastii: lmao
[4:36:41] sartrik: especially from GM perspective
[4:36:45] Advesperate: PF is much crunchier mechanically, D&D is casually
[4:36:59] Jauneofarc: Nooo
[4:37:02] O_Hell_Yeah: 2e is awesome
[4:37:02] Majmur: Wait, looked like your Q did no dmg to Kaisa. Unless she was barealy out of range
[4:37:10] O_Hell_Yeah: that’s only what we play
[4:37:10] derpstevenson: If you like casual mechanics 5e is the way to go, if you like tactics and character options PF2E is light years better.
[4:37:16] Jauneofarc: ... what
[4:37:22] sartrik: yeah, pc games based on pf1e
[4:37:32] sartrik: which is 3.5e dnd basically
[4:37:37] derpstevenson: You haven't played a PC game based on 2nd edition Pathfinder
[4:37:44] O_Hell_Yeah: it’s complicated lol
[4:37:45] derpstevenson: Those games are 1st edition
[4:37:56] Advesperate: 3.5 is an actual edition of D&D
[4:37:58] O_Hell_Yeah: yeah 3.5 e is basically that
[4:37:59] sartrik: pathfinder 1e is based on dnd 3.5
[4:38:01] TakenHorizon: The Owlcat Pathfinder Games are amazing.
[4:38:06] derpstevenson: There hasn't been a video game using PF2e rules
[4:38:08] Advesperate: pathfinder was a split version based off of 3.5 edition of D&D
[4:38:22] O_Hell_Yeah: yes
[4:38:25] sartrik: @derpstevenson well, there are some indie projects. like 2 of them
[4:38:45] derpstevenson: Owlcat games like Kingmaker/Wrath of the Righteous use pf1 rules.
[4:38:57] AnonyNoob: Smolder hit the 225 spike, game should be over
[4:39:05] Jauneofarc: Tf was that taliyah ult

[4:47:44] Algosith: like 3 hours a day for 90 years
[4:47:48] MrShayne: A little bit exaggerating xD
[4:48:04] AnonyNoob: The highest hours I know in any single game is Banny with 26k in Team Fortress 2. This is a man who's practically dedicated his life to that one game
[4:48:12] DJCombo111: I’ve been watching you stream for so long and you are so consistent so I just threw out a number
[4:49:12] heydoublea: @Wingsofdeath how long have you been streaming, i think i started watching 6-7 years ago
[4:49:24] heydoublea: nvm u jjust asnwered it lol
[4:50:24] krieger8772: You stream over 7 to 8 hrs 5 days a week
[4:50:30] Scorpio2196: Wonder how many hours T1 has into the game
[4:50:40] StreamElements: Twitter: www.twitter.com/wingsofdeathx Instagram: www.instagram.com/wingsofdeathofficial Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wingsofdeathx
[4:50:47] Advesperate: que times would kill it as well
[4:50:53] manny_senpai: didnt you say you would had quit league if u dont stream at all
[4:50:54] Advesperate: cause if you played at the start lol.
[4:50:58] rory_fking1: Yeah that's why i live in my mom's basement
[4:50:58] Junodude: que times count as gametime
[4:50:58] krieger8772: You did like a sabatic year because of a hand injure
[4:51:00] TwitchRin: i think i played WOW more than League
[4:51:11] Advesperate: i remember 1 hr ques back s1~3
[4:51:27] dravenmainxddd: maybe 20,000 hours could be more plausible
[4:51:35] AnonyNoob: Honestly for me, at this point League is just the waiting room for Gearbox to get their shit together and re-release Gigantic
[4:51:45] AnonyNoob: There's been a lot of hints from the discords mod team that it's coming soon
[4:51:51] heydoublea: <3 wow, i hate the backlash it always gets. If u dont like dont play it, dont talk crap still play it lol
[4:51:54] manny_senpai: does streaming pay well?
[4:51:59] skyiers: @Wingsofdeath Don't forget to play TF
[4:52:03] dravenmainxddd: maybe in between 10 and 20
[4:52:11] DJCombo111: 3 years playing time is a maybe
[4:52:18] heydoublea: wiingsofdeath vs wingsofredemption
[4:52:28] krieger8772: Around 40 hrs
[4:52:29] DJCombo111: I got 1 year playing time in FFXI in 3 years
[4:52:32] AnonyNoob: 3 years is plausible. The most hours I know of a single player in a single game is about 3 years
[4:53:13] Ardal_Obe: pretty sure I've got more than 3 years played time in wow
[4:53:31] crayotic_ez: my most played game is 12k hours on Ark and that was on and off as well
[4:53:41] Dayszen: not bad, light work
[4:53:45] krieger8772: But wings i remenber you did take a year break for injure
[4:53:55] rory_fking1: tylers got some fuckin hours logged
[4:54:10] dravenmainxddd: Tyler must have double @rory_fking1 lol
[4:54:26] manny_senpai: dude streams like 24 hours
[4:54:29] AnonyNoob: Tyler himself has fully admitted he has an addiction problem with League
[4:54:33] manny_senpai: 2 days straight
[4:54:46] Shut_ItDown_: He even plays offstream
[4:54:49] Francois_Fapperino: thats an actual illnes
[4:54:51] AnonyNoob: On a small tangent, I learned recently that his typing is cracked. He hits 100 WPM typing with only his index fingers, and thumb for spacebar
[4:55:04] KentavrZ: Dont forget to pick Twisted Fate @Wingsofdeath

[4:55:54] dravenmainxddd: you don’t think you would enjoy the game more if you eventually climbed to above master ?
[4:56:09] AnonyNoob: Respectable dodge tbh, if mans thinks he won't do well as jungle that's a reasonable game to not play IMO
[4:56:14] dravenmainxddd: or it’s just not ever fun at all
[4:56:36] Scorpio2196: Ah fair
[4:56:38] Tallantis: Wings sleep streams inc

[4:57:54] MrShayne: You need to be high Grandmaster/Challenger to have interesting games
[4:57:56] manny_senpai: riot cares more about their vanguard
[4:58:48] MrShayne: The ladder, yes
[4:59:04] DJCombo111: league streams got me into streams. you are one of the ogs I still follow. I saw Reginald in Vegas a couple years ago and fanboyed
