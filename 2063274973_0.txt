[4:13:46] neptunesxdl: solo leveling pacing is SO shit
[4:13:59] abel_k9: Is it?
[4:14:02] neptunesxdl: they went over 5 chapters per episode
[4:14:11] shockking1: boo hoo
[4:14:14] abel_k9: Oh yeah
[4:14:20] neptunesxdl: theyre at like chapter 24 or something now with 5 episodes

[4:14:26] shockking1: fuck no
[4:14:28] Shrimpixx: fuck smolder's top players
[4:14:33] neptunesxdl: on top of that the side characters are just useless
[4:14:41] neptunesxdl: @shockking1 the mini dungeon
[4:14:46] tele0: @neptunesxdl the pacing is fine though
[4:15:01] neptunesxdl: @tele0 5 chapters in 1 episode is not fine pacing lol
[4:15:09] abel_k9: The healer girl I like her. I'm on chapter 34 or something I started today lol
[4:15:22] shockking1: maybe the pacing of the webcomic is the thing that was shit
[4:15:25] tele0: @neptunesxdl I mean that’s kinda normal
[4:15:27] neptunesxdl: one episode he looks like a good for nothing, the next episode bro is a buffed 6'2 guy
[4:15:34] neptunesxdl: @shockking1 it was lol
[4:15:43] abel_k9: Lol yeah the animes all do that shit

[4:16:53] neptunesxdl: solo levelign has a webtoon and an anime
[4:16:54] shockking1: they are talking about solo leveling
[4:16:56] tele0: it’s a manwha
[4:16:57] abel_k9: Solo leveling
[4:16:57] shockking1: its an anime shit
[4:17:01] grodzik15: anime
[4:17:04] CaptainKanje: solo leveling is just an isekai than wont say its one to be different
[4:17:10] abel_k9: It's an anime but there's a manga that's completed
[4:17:15] shockking1: its basically reverse sword art online
[4:17:15] neptunesxdl: it's a korean comic that got adapted to an anime
[4:17:24] abel_k9: The anime is really good but not done yet @gamergirl
[4:17:31] neptunesxdl: imo, it's overhyped and overrated
[4:17:34] abel_k9: So we're reading 🤓
[4:17:41] noodleecat: the manhwa much better
[4:17:42] neptunesxdl: yeah imo its overrated
[4:17:50] abel_k9: It is over hyped
[4:18:10] abel_k9: But I'm still interested for some reason
[4:18:26] abel_k9: Juju kaisen way more over hyped
[4:18:27] neptunesxdl: fair, there are a lot of plotholes though
[4:18:33] abel_k9: :3
[4:18:37] makaronhs69: solo leveling is a bit over hyped imo
[4:18:40] neptunesxdl: jjk actually had characters that were useful tho
[4:18:41] tele0: dunno about overhyped, but everyone has their own opinions:)
[4:18:44] noodleecat: literally noone talked about that before the anime idk how its overhyped
[4:18:52] neptunesxdl: @noodleecat what? solo leveling?
[4:18:59] noodleecat: the manhwa way better than the anime adaption
[4:19:07] neptunesxdl: @noodleecat the art is ofc
[4:19:09] shockking1: ppl talked about it so fkin much when it was coming out in SAO times wat
[4:19:12] noodleecat: they didnt even follow the story right

[4:20:56] Branmuufin: dw smolder will scale Clueless
[4:21:01] neptunesxdl: @noodleecat the fact that it has so many plot holes and side characters are useless is what makes it bad
[4:21:09] abel_k9: BUT DO YOU NIT THINK SO FAR
[4:21:12] neptunesxdl: the side characters had 0 use in the whole story
[4:21:13] abel_k9: Aheaaaaad
