[0:06:19] lec_airport_speedrun: Why are we even here then
[0:06:26] lec_airport_speedrun: Cringe streamer
[0:06:45] Sylvain269: Oh thank goodness you went live Medic, I thought I had to watch Midbeast
[0:07:01] TaintedTitan: Morning everyone
[0:07:06] lec_airport_speedrun: Who's midbeast watching these days
[0:07:06] TaintedTitan: janna angle?
[0:07:47] lec_airport_speedrun: You could try an unfollow goal
[0:08:00] lec_airport_speedrun: Because lord knows no one's following for this gameplay
[0:08:22] TaintedTitan: it's a shame how worlds last year got cancelled after the first 2 games of the swiss stage
[0:09:35] TaintedTitan: quick, everyone unfollow Kappa
[0:09:49] Sylvain269: @lec_airport_speedrun No idea, probably a busty Asian girl

[0:10:14] JochenDerRochen1312: moin
[0:10:22] TaintedTitan: face reveal at 50k followers?

[0:11:43] Rilea_: Morning Medic and chat LuvSign
[0:12:18] TaintedTitan: the prometheus school of running away from things
[0:12:34] ch4ppi2: man senna is gonna be so hard to play into in the beginning
[0:12:47] BrackishBrit: Heya Medi! How do you feel about K'Sante in pro? It feels like they'd need to do something really drastic to make him unattractive to pros
[0:12:53] TaintedTitan: @Rilea_ Yes it is
[0:13:15] hitsujikoujou: You are the only support player that plays without mapcover so its useful to get better in my off-role.
[0:13:39] lec_airport_speedrun: @brackishbrit have you been watching LCK just now
[0:14:15] AveSanctis: good morning chat & Medic
[0:14:22] lec_airport_speedrun: medicHi_SG
[0:14:32] hitsujikoujou: Gwen was marked too Aware
[0:15:22] hitsujikoujou: You were never marked so small wins?
[0:15:34] ch4ppi2: Dont worry it could be worse.... Enemy support could be Keria Ashe
[0:16:07] ayhamsabbagh: Good morning ‚ù§

[0:16:39] ayhamsabbagh: u can call me ayham
[0:16:51] ayhamsabbagh: what was that 1 sided game from t1
[0:17:04] lec_airport_speedrun: It's only DK, not anyone good
[0:17:35] ayhamsabbagh: dk and t1 was like classico like rm and barca üòÇ
[0:17:44] BrackishBrit: I like how Kindred marks are like mini objectives in higher levels of play
[0:17:48] lec_airport_speedrun: They've fallen for the "rookie talent" lie
[0:18:01] BrackishBrit: In platlow, nobody really cares about them
[0:18:05] lec_airport_speedrun: Our EU orgs know better than to fall for such delusion
[0:20:34] BrackishBrit: Have you tried Bloodsong on Leona at all, or is Celestial Opposition too good for her?
[0:21:05] lec_airport_speedrun: It's only a varus, they're probably gonna build lethality anyway
[0:21:11] lec_airport_speedrun: TT hey don't deserve a support
[0:21:45] ch4ppi2: @lec_airport_speedrun arent we a bit unhinged with our opinions (:
[0:21:55] lec_airport_speedrun: No?
[0:21:59] BrackishBrit: If it was NLC2, it would've been BlackBloxer
[0:23:15] lec_airport_speedrun: See, I was right, it's a lethality varus
[0:23:33] lec_airport_speedrun: DNI material
[0:23:49] lec_airport_speedrun: Wait not me, the varus
[0:23:55] lec_airport_speedrun: What the fuck are you on about
[0:23:56] ch4ppi2: yeah got that quite quick, but it's less the funny troll, more than throw shit at the wall and see what stikcs
[0:24:44] teffy42: suddenly it's a party in botlane
[0:24:58] jaggler: well, varus was walking up to the naafiri and died
[0:25:08] jaggler: instead of you know, staying a bit safer
[0:27:04] itscharlas: I haven't played LoL in while; what's up with the little fires that give you stacks
[0:27:09] Squallly: Hey Medic!
[0:27:10] bene_ges: Sharks are older than trees?
[0:27:15] lec_airport_speedrun: Infernal rift bonus
[0:27:46] hitsujikoujou: I'm happy as a Qiyana main to not lose half of my kit 1/6 games.
[0:27:58] BrackishBrit: I call them flamin' hot cheetos
[0:28:24] zajchyy: its 0.6 ability haste no?
[0:28:44] zajchyy: must have been really boring...no fun guys xdding
[0:28:49] alinkAVN: it's been buffed a bit i assume
[0:28:56] lec_airport_speedrun: Caster and wrong, name a more iconic conbo
[0:29:11] purebread29: that means mushrooms are older than sharks or fungi
[0:29:27] bene_ges: Trees and Fungi have a symbiosis now
[0:29:32] Squallly: Forget Nashor - collecting cinders is the ultimate LoL PvE
[0:29:40] meikibuh: xdd medic
[0:29:49] lec_airport_speedrun: What is this kindred doing
[0:30:06] itscharlas: Trees not decomposing caused an ice age until the carbon trapped by them could return to the atmosphere, so that's another fun part of that period

[0:32:01] lec_airport_speedrun: Where are 1-12
[0:32:07] meikibuh: as much as i love aftershock on meele supports, it feels anti-supportive to not take glacial
[0:32:46] lun4tic_13: lun4tic_13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:33:27] ch4ppi2: @meikibuh I understand that sentiment, escpecially for thresh for example, but for leona just being able to go in a bit more recklessly i s just as supportive
[0:34:03] lec_airport_speedrun: WeirdChamp
[0:34:33] ch4ppi2: @MedicCasts are you finally marrying Vedius?
[0:34:41] lec_airport_speedrun: He is indeed

[0:35:44] ch4ppi2: ate is his words 5 seconds later KEK
[0:36:42] hitsujikoujou: Kaenic on Rakan when you're fed feels very good for me, am I deluded or is it actually good?
[0:37:07] jaggler: he's cosplaying as a ward
[0:37:19] BrackishBrit: Mouse battery died?
[0:37:24] jaggler: Kaenic in general feels omega strong
[0:38:03] BrackishBrit: Goddamn, that Kayn slaps

[0:42:18] remixlol1: @lec_airport_speedrun Last time I just ran down all 3 games so idk..
[0:42:32] Squallly: case in point: how many Synapse vids have you seen of people taking towers? :p
[0:42:32] remixlol1: Ye we went 2-1
[0:42:34] jaggler: running down all games is also a certain talent tbh
[0:42:38] jaggler: *lanes
[0:43:30] jaggler: all plays are synapse plays, considering the information to do those plays has to pass through synapses :)
[0:43:36] remixlol1: =)
[0:44:38] remixlol1: What do you wanna knoiw about cinders?
[0:44:42] remixlol1: I got all the knowledge
[0:44:49] lec_airport_speedrun: What's the AH on them
[0:44:55] abgewaschen_: its 0,5
[0:45:02] abgewaschen_: from 0,3 buffed to 0,5
[0:45:08] remixlol1: Its 0.3 original
[0:45:29] remixlol1: Im 99% sure its still 0.3 max 0.4
[0:45:42] reaskon: Its in patch notes for sure, increased to 0.6
[0:45:51] remixlol1: wow nvm i dont know jackshit about the game
[0:45:52] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[0:46:09] jaggler: no information. Just gather thing :)
[0:46:36] ch3m15try: will you be the person to add it :D
[0:46:44] lec_airport_speedrun: Riot are clearly heading towards abstracting all numbers from the game
[0:46:45] jaggler: is there a page for the infernal rifts?
[0:46:58] remixlol1: @lec_airport_speedrun yep, and im not a fan
[0:47:02] jaggler: oh, look up dragon pit
[0:47:06] hitsujikoujou: Have you seen the Lulu changes? It kinda feels like they are placebo buffs to me.
[0:47:09] lec_airport_speedrun: Wait what
[0:47:17] lec_airport_speedrun: I've barely paid attention, is that a thing
[0:47:35] ch3m15try: wtf
[0:47:38] remixlol1: Yeah makes sense Kappa
[0:47:49] ch3m15try: even tho its literally everywhere
[0:47:59] BrackishBrit: Honestly, I think placebo buffs are fine for pro at least, most people seem to have completely forgotten about Lulu for no reason @hitsujikoujou
[0:48:22] StreamElements: Please sub, I'm really really shit at games but it's not my fault, my monitor is actively griefing me and if I had a ‚Ç¨500000 monitor I would easily get rank one KR, go pro in TM and become good at hades.
[0:48:41] jaggler: old kinda noxus, kinda human male hmmm
[0:49:06] Sylvain269: Lulu
[0:49:08] Sylvain269: Milio
[0:49:16] jaggler: Lulu isn't from noxus or male Kappa
[0:49:18] Sylvain269: Anyone that can enhance her autoattacks
[0:49:18] remixlol1: Hwei Ashe vs nami
[0:49:36] remixlol1: current vayne playstyle doesnt want an entchanter

[0:54:20] UndeadKillerTBC: wait are sharks really older tha trees?

[0:54:25] lec_airport_speedrun: Fun
[0:54:30] jaggler: it do be a wow thing
[0:54:54] jaggler: naaah, just like all my valentines dates it ended with just three dead bodies Sadge
[0:55:05] lec_airport_speedrun: Ah, not so fun
[0:55:06] UndeadKillerTBC: i only play wotlk
[0:55:16] jaggler: we aren't that hardcore LUL
[0:55:20] Mysticflyr: theres a bug in my lane....
[0:55:31] lec_airport_speedrun: But also what the fuck are your dates
[0:55:54] jaggler: shushh shushh shushh
[0:55:55] itscharlas: Amirdrassil has a few wall bosses on mythic, so clearing it this tier is pretty good IMO. Last tier I think was way easier
[0:56:17] jaggler: we got gnarlroot, Igira and the snek down
[0:56:22] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[0:57:12] itscharlas: I stopped raiding this tier due to life, but I keep up with the guild and they are on Tindral atm. Smolderon was a wall and Tindral still is. Seems like a fun tier at least
[0:57:23] jaggler: the greeeed
[0:57:30] teffy42: tragic
[0:57:32] blocklore: your so yayne
[0:57:32] lec_airport_speedrun: Supp diff
[0:57:40] jaggler: Tindral is fucking brutal from what i have seen yes. But also fun
[0:58:05] hitsujikoujou: Thats the kind of mistake a top lane autofilled to bot wouldn't make because of their toplane ptsd
[0:58:07] itscharlas: @jaggler I think my guild is at something like 300 pulls and ~50% lol
[0:58:22] StreamElements: Got a great clip of the stream? Share it in the #Clips channel on the Discord

[1:05:42] hitsujikoujou: Time in the game beats timing the game
[1:06:19] TaintedTitan: akali RIOT
[1:06:56] TaintedTitan: catJAM
[1:09:04] TaintedTitan: is rylais good on lulu for the extra slow?
[1:09:38] hitsujikoujou: I think Lulu W is the only slow in the game thats not affected by slow resist.
[1:10:00] UndeadKillerTBC: meh mount didn't drop
[1:10:05] TaintedTitan: garen pressed R and was good at the game
[1:10:17] bigAL935: @MedicCasts hello good sir, congrats on getting engaged BIG Pog
[1:10:19] TaintedTitan: @UndeadKillerTBC Next run. Titan guarantee
[1:11:47] zajchyy: we getting that redemtiom soon tho

[1:14:09] UndeadKillerTBC: but are sharks wetter than trees Hmm
[1:15:08] TaintedTitan: @UndeadKillerTBC depends on how excited they are Kappa
[1:15:27] Pamoth: @TeamBDS This is 100% Cap - Trees are way cooler
[1:15:46] hitsujikoujou: Hard to play
[1:15:52] StreamElements: BDS merch is probably better than whatever your favourite team makes. Go to https://shop.teambds.gg/en/ and buy some you filthy animal.
[1:15:59] TeamBDS: @Pamoth oh yea? do they also have a movie like Jaws?
[1:16:02] TeamBDS: Stare
[1:16:21] UndeadKillerTBC: ok how about the trees from lotr
[1:16:27] TaintedTitan: @TeamBDS Groot.
[1:16:28] Pamoth: @TeamBDS Well.... You can kill a shark with a gun, you cant kill a tree with one
[1:16:35] Mysticflyr: has barron changed with redesign?
[1:16:47] menomorphus: @TeamBDS No way its real team BDS just chillin in the chat :D
[1:17:01] TaintedTitan: ^ it's not the actual players

[1:17:54] TaintedTitan: big mechanics
[1:17:56] TeamBDS: @itsmaffs Yes each player writes on word each
[1:17:56] menomorphus: And the keyboard duty?
[1:18:08] TeamBDS: @menomorphus Sheo Nuc, both have one half of the keyboard
[1:18:21] menomorphus: @TeamBDS LUL
[1:18:22] StreamElements: Please sub, it costs a lot to have hair this good and a fashion sense.
[1:18:23] killerwa1rus: now thats team synergy
[1:18:34] TeamBDS: Adam is reading out the messages in the chat and Ice is just spamming Varus Q's
[1:18:42] menomorphus: No wonder they are one of the best LEC teams :D
[1:18:57] Pamoth: @TeamBDS Adam just spinning around in the middle of the floor
[1:19:04] Mysticflyr: positve note, game is now over. :)
[1:19:07] menomorphus: He has moves :D
[1:19:29] Pamoth: Stopping every now and again to shout DEMACIA
[1:19:30] hitsujikoujou: Do you know of the Broken by concept podcast?
[1:19:32] abgewaschen_: after the games i get 3 report confirmations on average
[1:19:34] Improper64: You love the game and hate the players D:
[1:20:11] TaintedTitan: whats toss a coin?
[1:20:28] TaintedTitan: im surprised your team has the mechanics
[1:20:43] TaintedTitan: to ff
[1:21:14] Squallly: wooo, day 4 of no internet - thank god my neighbours are totally awesome and let me use their house
[1:21:18] Pamoth: Caedrel wants to know if you will cast the T1 challengers game with him cos he is an NPC solo
[1:21:25] killerwa1rus: names a red flag
[1:21:28] chancellorpalpatine66: check wards from team
[1:21:47] chancellorpalpatine66: lol
[1:22:08] Sylvain269: Geez Akali bought 6 control wards
[1:22:08] killerwa1rus: KEKW
[1:22:19] killerwa1rus: thats wild

[1:22:22] StreamElements: Join Medic's Discord! http://discord.gg/medic
[1:22:22] LoLRankBot: Medic is Diamond I 18 LP  | Altaccount is Platinum II 36 LP
[1:22:23] petrounayaya: guy hates wards, like literally
[1:22:36] Sylvain269: I ALWAYS buy control wards if I have 75 or more gold remaining
[1:22:37] Shadyhog: lets see facts or i call it misinformation kekw
[1:22:42] Sylvain269: There's just no reason not to
[1:23:09] Sylvain269: Vision is so OP
[1:23:16] killerwa1rus: why kill ward when you can kill champion?
[1:23:16] menomorphus: He doesn't want to spend that 75g
[1:23:16] itscharlas: I love gold more than I like vision
[1:23:19] isak_102: well depending on which champs u play thats not a good thing @Sylvain269
[1:23:26] Vepziidoo: people just expect the support to light up the entire map for them
[1:23:27] itscharlas: that's why I peaked at D3
[1:23:27] isak_102: on tanks sure its good
[1:23:30] Sylvain269: Yeah this Kayn either had an off day or he's just terrible
[1:23:44] Sylvain269: I mean there's just no reason not to buy control wards
[1:23:58] Sylvain269: @isak_102 Why
[1:24:09] UndeadKillerTBC: gold players have more vision score than that
[1:24:15] exwarior: is the average age of all alive sharks greater than the average age of all trees?
[1:24:34] isak_102: yes there is, on some champs item spikes are really important. for example if ur playing an assasin, if ur constantly buying two control wards every base then u wont get ur item spikes @Sylvain269
[1:24:53] abgewaschen_: What i see in proplay: if team is behind only the supp is buying Control wards. When Team ahead everyone buys a lot
[1:24:56] isak_102: sure u should buy a control ward if u can if dragon is spawning or something, but not every base
[1:25:04] isak_102: as medic said
[1:25:06] Sylvain269: @isak_102 That is true, I do buy control wards less if I'm playing an assassin myself
[1:25:28] Sylvain269: But this Kayn should've had at least 2 control wards purchased
[1:26:08] Mysticflyr: only the greenland shark has a long age, 500 years, but redwoods etrc can live over 1k.
[1:26:12] hitsujikoujou: I like how TF didnt follow up on his question.
[1:26:24] Rilea_: What did you think of Saltburn Medic?
[1:26:26] exwarior: @Mysticflyr holy fuck really?
[1:26:26] menomorphus: In 1386, a pig in France was executed by public hanging for the murder of a child. Now you know this useless piece of info :D
[1:26:27] isak_102: yea im not arguing against that, i just disagreed with what u said that theres no reason not to buy control wards every time
[1:26:33] plasticbaby1: I love Medic‚Äôs face, it‚Äôs so incredibly Slavic. I‚Äôve studied physical anthropology and this is going to sound creepy but he has a very cool facial bone structure, I would love to see his skull
[1:26:48] TimmyThaTurtle: Medi!! predictions for LEC this weekend??
[1:27:29] solidussovis: I usually watch a lot of Broxah and Santorin streams. They buy control wards almost every base. Assassin if more so. You need to make sure they do t see you coming
[1:27:30] petrounayaya: g2 taking it home?
[1:27:53] menomorphus: I'd love to see BDS in MSI :D
[1:28:03] TaintedTitan: whaaat a wonderful giiiirl, could she be any cuuuuter

[1:29:05] Sylvain269: @isak_102 I might've made an absolute statement, but it depends on a variety of factors
