[2:51:10] Brain_Damage: @agiantsandwich I understand it to be so but I feel as though I take advantage of other giving to me and I am not grateful as I should be for it as much as I should be simply because I cannot give back as much as I feel I owe. how can I accept that I‚Äôm not terrible for not being able to give back to those I am most grateful for and not just being a dumb useless mule I am of a man
[2:51:58] agiantsandwich: I think you just have a problem accepting others support my guy
