[2:11:01] soonorlaterimb: statick might not be that bad since it's low cost so it lets you go navori faster
[2:11:59] Kinteshi: thats just sivir in its core tho bla
[2:12:07] OGyamen: I tried it a few games. So far PD into Navori feels the best crit option to me. But so far the very best felt black cleaver rush. Which is super susge

[4:57:39] MikuChan1998: botrk is an insane spike
[4:57:39] rases00: he can get towers very fast, so even if he goes yasuo's special 0/10 is still useful in the sides
[4:57:44] MikuChan1998: and nashors isn't bad eithewr
[4:57:45] Moobot: Join my discord! https://discord.com/invite/spktr
[4:57:47] lattestream: AP twitch is a lot better than AD twitch but they're both pretty meh right now compared to a lot of other stuff
[4:57:54] xcalebur: twitch should just experience what nilah experienced earlier
[4:57:59] MikuChan1998: if AP can snowball it gets out of hand fast
[4:58:16] kyshihixd: i mean that works for almost all champs

[5:00:44] lattestream: the league community has become so unbelievably cringe
[5:00:50] MikuChan1998: I think Zwyroo just had a bad game
[5:00:56] MikuChan1998: he will stomp feisty today
[5:00:59] MikuChan1998: no kap
[5:01:07] stiftman: ye just got way too far behind everywhere except bot
[5:01:08] heyyimtom: @lattestream has it ever been not cringe?

[5:01:34] chicotezzz: @MikuChan1998 thx
[5:01:35] xcalebur: me when i juxtapose my opinion as soon as streamer says something different
[5:01:43] lattestream: @heyyimtom I don't remember but I feel like it wasn't always this bad, the whole L9 culture as well as all the ff culture got worse over time for sure
[5:02:05] ADL1337: you are dealing NO damage
[5:02:33] lattestream: surrender vote should just be removed and "go next" and suchlike should be phrases that get u muted
[5:02:40] jchgc2741: somehow viego tank lots of your autos
[5:02:43] lattestream: it's over the top but something needs to be done about ff culture

[5:03:33] Atomik_7x: REAL
[5:04:22] bombalafay: can you play zeri
[5:04:29] athenscall: These 10 mins are so depressing to play rather than losing a 45 min game
[5:04:36] mitchxyou: man why is collector so expensive now, i hate getting it on samira now
[5:04:38] Kosakeee: the draven guide its pretty useful, i tried the purple runes goated
[5:04:39] Atomik_7x: League of Draven
[5:04:40] heyyimtom: @lattestream true, but the sanctioning doesnt help when its kind of inherent to online team games
[5:04:43] Kinteshi: aphe?
[5:04:49] mickazlol: do you ever play nilah
[5:04:49] Atomik_7x: i wanna main him so bad but he is so hard to play
[5:04:57] stiftman: was the bork rageblade build because ksante? shouldnt azir have dmg for ksante? or do u just think that build is better?
[5:05:04] omme_12: wait what happen i look away for 2 min and we in queue
[5:05:15] heyyimtom: go vayne again to get a longer game maybe?
