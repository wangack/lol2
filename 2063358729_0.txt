[6:22:37] Dorullmisbruker: "Predictions every game, fun time good time POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE" Sure
[6:22:39] Jubling_: 50% winrate means you're in the correct elo Kapp
[6:22:51] TalmoNub: I have that same problem when I play ranked, thats why I'm an aram wanker
[6:22:55] peerlessunderthestars: hot and cold gamer pausecham
[6:22:55] eshneh93: @Jubling_ he will never accept this
[6:23:05] lollifant5: @michael_cee pausecham . . .

[6:23:31] juhiizRS: Sadge
[6:23:31] vigane: are you having fun tho?
[6:23:39] michael_cee: @lollifant5 if its only ever happening to him then its a pattern and its rational to suggest a closer examination and analysis of the circumstances could lead to more consistent positive results
[6:23:44] MrTvern: Prayge he missclicks on believe
[6:23:49] lollifant5: @michael_cee my eyes Starege
[6:23:50] jub0002: this will pass bro, winners q will come
[6:23:53] fatman_on_a_bike: you dont take enough risks in the game to pick the inters on their team
[6:23:57] Thomas_Bont: youve lost so much you are just playing with platinum 2 is why u get no lp lol
[6:23:58] DankWizard420: I'm losing 30 a game now YEP

[6:24:18] S1lentc0re: 29thofAugustForsenIncident
[6:24:18] lollifant5: @michael_cee I do wonder though, maybe it's happened a few times to enemies but we couldn't see it because they surrendered immediately Shruge
[6:24:26] unguided_: i agree, too many inters. the only way to climb is if you get at least normal team. those who climb just get better teams. simple
[6:24:33] DankWizard420: the whole "the other team has more trolls" is such horseshit statistics KEKW
[6:24:43] eshneh93: as long as you aren't trolling, you have 4 cunts on your team max, enemy can have 5 so as long as you perform well you WILL climb eventually
[6:24:56] Fatsackz: game is fked lately especially with the new battle mage items
[6:24:59] MrTvern: michael_cee are you using chatgpt to answer? LUL

[6:25:18] S1lentc0re: @eshneh93 yeah but by that time the sample size is way too large and ur winning +26 and losing -31
[6:25:27] kikibro: This happened to me last year, it happens less in higher elos. Emerald is fucking unhinged for inting and toxicity
[6:25:27] Ebolakek: Hobestly, emerald is rough elo hell... Many ppl in worst mental state and some ppl just straight up 'tryout' stuff
[6:25:36] Allon_123: truthfully there are times where u do throw sometimes

[6:26:43] fatman_on_a_bike: Nah this game is tho queuing up this tilted is so illigal

[6:26:57] 23l9: everybody blames you
[6:26:58] Klaps__: this games just cursed
[6:26:58] NPXL: do you think there's a universe where you make a different string of decisions to win that one
[6:27:04] eshneh93: i don't like seeing streamer so upset tbh :(

[6:27:55] Beatdown115: cos its literlaly the elo created to catch stuckers
[6:27:55] Scotterif: nothing wrong with being an emerald player
[6:27:55] Veetu67: still not interested in trying where another acc would end up at?
[6:28:02] eshneh93: if you can say you carried in most of your games daliy then that's good, don't worry about the number of LP
[6:28:06] Fappuccino_Monkey: biggest mistake was opening league FeelsBadMan
[6:28:21] Natte_Kaas: this acc is doomed
[6:28:23] eshneh93: @Fappuccino_Monkey we need to find the guy who said play 1 game while osrs was down for 30 mins
