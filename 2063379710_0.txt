[0:09:53] getsometalentloser: every game lost was bot lane chain feeding before I was even near
[0:09:56] BicepSlicerBoy: I've been watching the LCK and I'm so lost on the Milio support pick every game. He has 0% win rate against Nautillus. Tank engage playmaking just seems to make the game so much easier to play lol.
[0:10:55] HalfmanDaan: What a bliss, I can work and learn how to jungle at the same time
[0:11:05] sleeveen709: been seeing a lot of belveth lately

[0:12:58] BicepSlicerBoy: @getsometalentloser top lane is so fun though! You get to chill for the whole game.
[0:13:29] getsometalentloser: @santorin  top was my orginal role
[0:13:34] getsometalentloser: it’s like easy mode to win for me
[0:13:35] sleeveen709: Razork ouuu
[0:13:39] sleeveen709: banger game
[0:13:47] getsometalentloser: but champ pool for toplane is boring compared to jungle

[0:15:27] BicepSlicerBoy: @karrden SAME
[0:15:35] jonasthr1: i queue jungle/top and i never get top, so i think elo has a lot to do with it
[0:15:46] rinseandretreat: hey Santorin, do you always use A to auto-attack or do you sometimes right click?
[0:17:36] Captainfordie: bot lane being a fiesta? standard

[0:35:32] moosE3knucklE: people's macro is just so bad anymore. even pro teams. like T1 vs DK earlier. DK traded 2 kills for faker to take all 3 top turrets and half an inhib. lol it was 7-0 dk in kills but were losing by 2.5k gold
[0:36:02] guiltyprawn: Top diff is not good for jg santorinFine
[0:36:13] madgym02: if I took no dmg like udyr I prob would’ve ran it down too 😅😂

[0:57:44] guiltyprawn: pepoHmm I saw that Q
[0:58:37] Falcnation: he doesnt know that their macro changes based on comp, you cant be split up against a rengar
[0:58:52] saviour_lol: thats a very generous statement regarding a player in your game
[0:59:03] onlygoesham: My question is what do you do when there is not just one but 2 people who don't want to win, what do you do to win?
[0:59:06] antisuji: ah. I like to play Ivern and my team never helps me with objectives and it's so tough.
[1:00:13] Falcnation: senna sups are generally trash they just climb because she scales well and their team carries them
[1:00:22] paaaanda1: @onlygoesham just ddos the enemy
[1:01:18] EdgedSilver: Kayn mains too?
[1:01:21] onlygoesham: Yh I feel I'm playing well at but seem like I'm stuck at the climb now as it feels nearly every game there is someone with mental boom
[1:01:44] onlygoesham: @paaaanda1 yeh imagine 😂
[1:01:52] paaaanda1: @onlygoesham happens in every elo, just gotta hope your team mental booms less than the enemy team LUL

[1:04:23] NachoLazer_: Ezreal just casually e'ing closer to a Galio..
[1:04:29] Falcnation: people are hyper aggro this season and throw so easily
[1:04:50] sebastianminiatures: Jax is a weak champion who hasn't been meta in years Kappa

[1:32:18] Whitetigerr_: hey Santorin my brother from anoyther mother.. can u give tips on teemo top? it's actally clean to blind ppl and shroom fr fr
[1:32:26] Mavvrix: Hec shouldve helped you pushed there right?
[1:32:26] oreomegalul: statistically if you get to horizon focus you’re on a 60% win rate
[1:32:42] TheGesterr: @Santorin that path doesn't spot from tower btw just tried it in practice tool SeemsGood 󠀀
[1:32:58] Whitetigerr_: LMAO

[1:36:30] louiecheese: why is my jg mid
[1:36:44] supercole2001: good to see you and Kels farm cannons the same
[1:37:13] Whitetigerr_: he's scripting bro
[1:38:02] shadow7master: cannons xdd
[1:38:31] Whitetigerr_: im nr1 emerald teemo canon securer bro trust in teemo
[1:38:40] motorboater2: fknchillbrodamn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! cs is overrated, farm champs not minions

[1:42:09] Whitetigerr_: Been thinking he cute since 2015 Kreygasm
[1:44:12] Whitetigerr_: LUL
[1:44:23] sebastianminiatures: you said last game, never give up
[1:44:26] sebastianminiatures: NEVER GIVE UP
[1:44:59] Whitetigerr_: You're motivating me to stop playing teemo top and play karma mid instead
[1:45:01] Whitetigerr_: thank you santorin
[1:45:10] Ace_strup: i have a scary question, what are the odds of twitch prime subs ever going away you think?
[1:45:39] sibersilverfox: that wombo combo was nasty
[1:45:57] EdgedSilver: @Ace_strup about as likely as Twitch dying... so pretty high with their financial outlook lol
[1:46:10] shadow7master: who said hecarim doesnt hv counter xdd
[1:46:15] Ace_strup: @EdgedSilver hmm ok i don't know enough about it, that makes sense tho
[1:46:27] Whitetigerr_: LMAO
[1:46:30] Ace_strup: @EdgedSilver lollllll
[1:46:48] EdgedSilver: @Ace_strup basically, if you see a stream in 720P or higher, with less than 1500 viewers, it's probably losing twitch money
[1:46:52] Whitetigerr_: o ma lawd
[1:47:27] shadow7master: i blame jankos for the heca pick
[1:47:31] Whitetigerr_: it's actually insane tho how this gameplay from ur team doesn't look much different from low em rank
[1:47:47] Baker076: even if they got a good  comp there should be no way out of seraphine having 10 deaths
[1:49:17] Whitetigerr_: This heca is ill bro
[1:49:36] Whitetigerr_: i gtg.. gl man i believe :) U win these.. just smile and it's free <3
[1:49:38] Whitetigerr_: seya <3 <3
[1:51:38] sebastianminiatures: Reminds me of Core and Doublelift playing Sona Taric xD
[1:52:00] shadow7master: its painful to farm as karma
[1:53:04] Counter_JG: told you, no counter to hecarim. too strong
[1:56:00] Baker076: soloing drag takes so long early. ekko cleared 3 or 4 camps in the same time
[1:56:44] binultwitch: senna is so strong rn
[1:57:00] Baker076: ye or go voidlings
[1:58:26] shadow7master: they give you teletubbies + autofil cant carry
[2:01:59] TheGesterr: ot
[2:02:08] TheGesterr: it's ok they're reworking Seraphine again in 14.5 luxxStabbies
[2:02:46] alabamahammer02: what's the lore behind "BAN ANNIE" or is it just to remind you? kekw
[2:02:55] TheGesterr: they haven't said specific but Phreak wants her to max Q and E when playing mid/bot and build AP gain and focus on damage instead of her W, saying to become more like Lux
[2:02:56] RifleEU: riot creating seraphine is such a mistake, shes really sona 2.0, not creative at all
[2:03:11] lookoutitscaleb: oh no! The sun is coming up and i haven't gone to bed yet 0.0
[2:03:29] alabamahammer02: hahahaha
[2:03:44] KillYourShadows: I find it really annoying Riot makes you pick a second roll; yes your queue times are sometimes shorter and you should know how to play other rolls but I find it to be more of a detriment. Let people have the option to queue one role and have longer que times; no one is ever happy to be filling a role other than the one they want
[2:04:33] TheGesterr: it's super frustrating with her W spam, it's super brainless and I main her, it's boring for us Seraphine mains too trust
[2:04:43] TheGesterr: so I'm happy to hear their new direction with her
[2:05:18] TheGesterr: we know it's boring to play against, and it's boring for us to play as
[2:05:27] TheGesterr: no one likes this version of Seraphine

[2:06:11] catlover12435: cootie?
[2:06:41] KillYourShadows: Agree, it would definitely make higher elo games have longer queue but like that last game, people get tilted getting filled with their other teammates while the other team is all on role. Just feel bad in genral for those games

[4:05:34] RifleEU: i really dislike noc after the tether changes ): u miss so many e's
[4:06:27] SilverSurferIsRadd: raptors > red > krugs > recall for longsword is goated on nocturne
[4:06:32] ZayaFire: Am I missing something, why is there a garen in every time today in challenger games?
[4:06:35] lackmind9: Do you always start raptors on noc?
[4:07:07] SilverSurferIsRadd: I always start raptors on noct, do red side then get the long sword and you win every 1 on 1 until they start backing
[4:07:39] shadow7master: raptors easy to kill with the pasive
[4:07:51] RifleEU: did you try the fast grubbs clear on noc? wolves-raptors-krugs-red-blue-gromp reset wolves-raptors-krugs min 5 and ure lvl 5 on grubbs
[4:09:25] SilverSurferIsRadd: can they still see your pings if you're premade only...?
[4:09:52] JoosyJ: voice comms coulda been useful there RIOT
[4:09:56] DJ_Photik: Every time you get a Naut seems like no fun for u.. Ban him maybe
[4:10:00] shadow7master: you called it and still this naut lost all the advantage
[4:12:31] tugwos: That player isn't going to play better on a different champ
[4:14:16] brightdiscord: GAREN OUTPLAY PogChamp
[4:15:00] Dntspeedup: santorinPog santorinPog santorinPog
[4:15:04] SilverSurferIsRadd: I know it's obviously leafy but what's the decision making like for ganking? Would you not want to gank top / mid since they are ahead and just deem bot lost until roaming phase?
[4:15:08] nwa4lifeTV: i see youre enjoying the stridebreaker, next patch its getting buffed
[4:16:29] nwa4lifeTV: increasing the ms to 3secs
[4:16:48] nwa4lifeTV: on the active
[4:17:54] SilverSurferIsRadd: for sure, makes sense
[4:18:31] SilverSurferIsRadd: always the decision to make for us emerald players on "do I continue ganking the player thats ahead OR gank the player behind to try and get him back in the game"
[4:19:41] Dntspeedup: santorinComfy santorinEZ santorinHype
[4:20:33] darkkkona: i would never gank if my top laner 0/3
[4:20:44] nwa4lifeTV: i think this game xerath has better carry potential when compared to garen
[4:21:05] Falcnation: i think it depends on the champ, an 0/2 fizz is different from a 0/2 malphite
[4:21:15] brightdiscord: we must destroy all yone players ReallyMad
[4:21:34] SilverSurferIsRadd: @darkkkona in my unfortunate experience, that's when the top will call jngl diff and refuse to play the rest of the game
[4:21:40] Dntspeedup: santorinW santorinW santorinW
[4:21:49] Dntspeedup: santorinLUL
[4:22:26] darkkkona: @SilverSurferIsRadd jungle diff is meant for higher elos. otherwise it is whole another world there
[4:23:03] Baker076: @SilverSurferIsRadd ive had teammates say jng diff games when im even up in ganks and farm. they're projecting
[4:23:06] Falcnation: low elos will not ward and overextend, get ganked and call jg diff lol
[4:23:32] nwa4lifeTV: just mute ur negative team
[4:23:33] TheGesterr: time for the sad jams PoroSad
[4:23:45] MythologyPlays: you like stride more than hexplate on noc?

[4:23:59] SilverSurferIsRadd: @Baker076 oh for sure, doesn't help their mental tho unfortunately and leaves us 4v5
[4:24:09] nwa4lifeTV: eclipse is good since u have 2 other tanks
[4:24:17] darkkkona: mid game nocturne already falling hard Aware
[4:24:50] brightdiscord: it really is a heist this game

[4:32:17] shadow7master: GG
[4:32:36] nwa4lifeTV: riot want to make stridebreaker great again
[4:33:30] nwa4lifeTV: theyre also buffing rav hydra
[4:34:06] lol_levart: zven is in korea rn right
[4:34:19] nwa4lifeTV: theyre only buffing the actives, not the stats
[4:34:47] shadow7master: i mean rav hydra hv good stats
[4:35:22] nwa4lifeTV: its in retaliation to profane hydra being popular
[4:35:53] nwa4lifeTV: theyre leaving profane, only buffing stride and rav
[4:36:17] shadow7master: its because when u buy rav u cant buy stride
[4:36:24] nwa4lifeTV: voli also getting buffed

[5:43:13] iiNumb3rz: I prefer the educational danish chap on screen
[5:43:20] MythologyPlays: Tarz definitely has toxic traits when things don't go his way.
[5:44:11] MythologyPlays: Santorin, Dopa, and Tarzaned are like the trinity of soloq junglers though
[5:44:24] iiNumb3rz: Is it possible to start raptors on gragas with q or is thst just trolling?
[5:45:26] tugwos: Do Naafari dogs make it so there's no isolation for Khazix?
[5:45:39] DJ_Photik: Is it champs only
[5:45:48] getsometalentloser: @Santorin u noticed some lees have started going ingenius to abuse eclipse and sundered combo

[5:47:45] MythologyPlays: I like W personally, but i think it's somewhat subjective
[5:47:47] DJ_Photik: Dependable
[5:47:50] iiNumb3rz: I'll defer to the dude who someone paid money to play this game.
[5:47:53] DJ_Photik: Situational
[5:48:12] iiNumb3rz: Sadly nobody pays me to play this game.

[6:05:07] getsometalentloser: litteraly the champ just delivers dmg for the itms he builds
[6:05:11] getsometalentloser: rather then do his own thing
[6:05:21] RifleEU: remember the nida days when q did so much dmg so u Q forward ult w backwards
[6:05:25] hazygreys: so yea mid not gonna win now lol

[6:07:10] RifleEU: i remember meet your makers players on the client spectateable on eune
[6:10:11] tugwos: Shaco boxes are immune to smite since season 5 or so I think
[6:10:30] Ancarage: pretty sure it is not that early
[6:10:43] tugwos: 9 years ago.
[6:10:53] tugwos: whatever that is
[6:11:36] Ancarage: pretty sure the shaco boxes can be smited 2-3 seasons ago at the very least
[6:12:01] tugwos: if so, then they added it back in, and maybe took it back out again.  Could be
[6:13:12] bgjd12: @Ancarage yea they can be
[6:13:34] NoVittuZiis: Only OGs remember that you had to be better than average to even reach Bronze tier

[6:18:39] Ancarage: except there are so many melee squishy champion now it feels weird when i can only hit melee but i need blue form
