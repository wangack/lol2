[0:13:44] msshinxx: urgh i love this ahri chroma sm
[0:13:52] BronzeLegends: in the late hours it feels like riot is using AI when there is no normal player to que in ranked
[0:13:53] Darkcyter: @ItsNevin 4 years kaypHYPERS WB
[0:13:55] Angelyc: LOL
[0:14:07] Angelyc: that guy made so many enemies witrh that tweet

[0:16:10] MojoXan: you look amazing today :)
[0:16:15] Frozenfruit13: I don’t think a real human is masterminding the matchmaking, that’s just giving riot to much credit
[0:16:23] AutumnReds: i mean thats what vods do. it's not perfect but nice to have them

[0:23:31] wilbert_1995: Twitch bye Jillipuff? TearGlove
[0:23:35] l4zyL3gz: For the new players like me, what is the story about the promo's u talked about?
[0:23:43] Mayveda: Years ago i heard from someone that the more report we're sending the more toxic people we get. The thought process behind that is that riot is basically using those who actually make fair reports to make the ban system work
[0:24:29] kalpaf: hey it's ori and the blind forest theme Pog I adore it
[0:24:49] RadiantWisp: as a support I am against your idea
[0:25:03] zehalla: i agree <3 let's hope we get the change we want for once

[0:37:21] jimbob_ywert: Gosh week day games are ALWAYS A BLESSING!
[0:37:30] shedfirekid1: riot james giving no LP. so stingy
[0:37:31] viktorxcx: +17 for a win and -35 for a loss LUL seems fair
[0:37:45] roxmysoxx89: it’s because your wr is negative
[0:38:07] jeroenvijver: whats ur ' your shop' kp? :O
[0:38:15] zehalla: and it almost doesn't matter if you play well you'll still get lower lp than you deserve BibleThump
[0:38:17] priam0: Good afternoon kaypeariña
[0:38:29] ducthangn: Did they limit the lp bonus ?
[0:38:35] MissUnfortuneK: nah mine is negative and i am getting -21 and +22
[0:38:48] evakp: no
[0:38:50] KyraBelade: which country you on rn? <3 If you dont mind me asking
[0:38:54] shedfirekid1: sounds like riot math to me
[0:39:01] dodosz28: hii girl how are you doing?
[0:39:18] jeroenvijver: its because riot didnt make lp gains performance basedd, which just needs to happen
[0:39:30] Niomah: excedrin, two cups of coffee, and a soda and this headache still persists
[0:39:33] jeroenvijver: they have so many stats after games they can link it with
[0:39:42] Niomah: stupid cold front moving through
[0:39:44] MSJ241: good luck
[0:40:09] priam0: Niomah, you need some beer for headache
[0:40:21] Sunnytinker: its not having a fun time in his games
[0:40:33] jzipfel20: He is getting a lot of bad teammates today

[0:41:07] priam0: @niomah 20° and Sun here 😬
[0:41:07] GreenTeaTopping: He is a BEAST!!
[0:41:11] THE_Bacon90: @KayPea did you officially move to Denmark or r u there just momentarily?
[0:41:17] jzipfel20: He got himself and rank 1 galio, so it was really bad
[0:41:32] evakp: still maiming jungle!?
[0:41:32] Femuline: yeah earlier when lucas was autofill mid, his enemy jungle was autofill so he was like why would riot not switch us
[0:41:35] jimbob_ywert: Orianna game?
[0:41:41] Sunnytinker: yeah Lucas has been saying that he is playing with teletubbies, a lot NotLikeThis
[0:41:44] evakp: maining*
[0:41:52] jimbob_ywert: your Orianna plays are super clean! would love to see them back :)
[0:41:58] roxmysoxx89: he’s probably playing people much lower rated mmr wise. think about an extreme eg he plays a bronze in challenger. same concept against a master or gm
[0:42:00] GreenTeaTopping: welcome to the best country in the world <3
[0:42:04] Angelyc: hilarious
[0:42:05] Sunnytinker: i love it

[0:42:15] meep_: It's funny and goofy
[0:42:16] shedfirekid1: it’s the same as toddler soccer
[0:42:17] watson1235: call it like it is 🤣
[0:42:20] msshinxx: its not offensive
[0:42:21] kenlaan: until teletubbies becomes co-opted as a slur, it's hilarious
[0:42:22] Mknudsen89: His stream is missing a Freya! :D :D
[0:42:25] msshinxx: its a fun way lol
[0:42:26] Niomah: Teletubbies are cute, childish, and harmless, it's almost too nice
[0:42:27] viktorxcx: Teletubbies sounds way better than raging and insulting like certain other streamers
[0:42:31] markella_andri: Hello kaypComfy kaypFlower

[0:43:03] msshinxx: didiot teletubby
[0:43:37] priam0: Looking for support and tanky jungler to climb up the Kilimanjaro
[0:43:49] Sir_Fish_Bucket: debatable
[0:43:52] viktorxcx: I should start calling them Teletubbies too LUL I got chat restricted for 2 weeks for calling someone an idiot.. That's literally all I typed all game LUL

[0:44:10] meowththesecond: finally got some time to come say hi everyone, hope all is well!
[0:44:11] Niomah: If I had a dime for every time I was called "cancer" in an ARAM I could actually buy a grande mocha frappuccino from Starbucks with a slice of lemon poundcake.
[0:44:12] lawfulevil_13: Whaaa?! But I was told by the propaganda that Murica was the best country in the world?
[0:44:13] evakp: yess
[0:44:23] markella_andri: @darkcyter kaypHello
[0:44:26] Darkcyter: @meowththesecond kaypHello

[0:44:44] ducthangn: What is a champ that u used to love but no longer play?
[0:44:49] lawfulevil_13: That's what they told us. It has to be true
[0:44:53] GreenTeaTopping: @lawfulevil_13 LUL
[0:44:54] ItsAMoll: america sucks
[0:45:00] priam0: Ori and amumu have a very good combo
[0:45:03] markella_andri: Puppy Freya nap queen kaypFreya kaypInLove
[0:45:06] Sir_Fish_Bucket: Texas is clearly the best country
[0:45:08] BiSettual: Canada is truly the best, so beautiful
[0:45:10] jzipfel20: America is too judgy
[0:45:19] lawfulevil_13: @sir_fish_bucket LUL
[0:45:21] viktorxcx: I visited Toronto once and I was debating if I should leave or just stay there for good LUL
[0:45:23] ChiSkillz: US and Canada are pretty close in their pros and cons.  Both top tier
[0:45:25] lawfulevil_13: America is a mess
[0:45:46] Undead_Vikings_Daxcraft: I really want to go to Canada some day and experience it :D
[0:45:50] ChiSkillz: @lawfulevil_13 only a mess if you have poor credit LuL
[0:45:51] GreenTeaTopping: and Denmark is FLAT hahaah
[0:45:54] jzipfel20: America is on a steady decline
[0:45:55] Darkcyter: This could be taken in the wrong way but I don't think being too multicultral is necessarily a good thing
[0:45:57] jvvlx: America sucks, don't know why everyone still living an american dream
[0:46:01] Niomah: America is currently a dystopian capitalist hellscape.
[0:46:02] lawfulevil_13: @chiskillz so true
[0:46:05] jimbob_ywert: Canada is definitely a mess but beautiful. Such a large country with such a small population though, sad it has a history so rough 😔
[0:46:07] priam0: I stay in my Spain. We have the worst politics in the world, but best food and nice weather
[0:46:11] Femuline: i love canada but y’all are practically antarctica
[0:46:13] sweetpersephone: Isn't Canada the country that gave dirty water to Natives?
[0:46:15] Femuline: i can’t do cold
[0:46:15] GreenTeaTopping: iam proud to be a Dane
[0:46:20] Angelyc: I would fear for my life if i a kid is the states

[0:46:21] evakp: agreed
[0:46:22] Angelyc: all im saying
[0:46:24] ducthangn: Have we done prediction? ,:p
[0:46:25] lawfulevil_13: @niomah hundo percent
[0:46:38] ChiSkillz: People that say America sucks are ignorant on what actually goes on in the US and are going off the opinions of others
[0:46:44] pianostics: pianostics subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 6 months <3 quit league but love to support your stream <3
[0:46:56] Niomah: @lawfulevil_13 Depending on the outcome in Nov I may try to cash in on my grandad being Canadian to gtfo of the US
[0:46:56] jimbob_ywert: @jvvlx America doesn’t suck, it just has too much freedom and too complicated. the reason people live there is because of the IMMENSE advantages it has as well as the privet age you get with an American passport :)
[0:47:00] Angelyc: @ChiSkillz why are you so triggered. the states has a lot of issues with it..
[0:47:08] Prjct_ApolloVT: hi kayyyy
[0:47:20] ChiSkillz: @Angelyc I'm not triggered.  You may not like it at all.  but it doesn't "suck"
[0:47:25] Angelyc: @ChiSkillz ehhh
[0:47:26] yanjii: do you feel safer in Europe so?
[0:47:27] Prjct_ApolloVT: we talking bout murica?
[0:47:34] sequelsarenotcanon: im from scotland i would never live in america that healthcare is a crime
[0:47:34] roxmysoxx89: not where I’m from. we are top five in crime index in the world lol
[0:47:38] jvvlx: When I was first time in NYC and was on the metro someone plug the bomb here????
[0:47:42] jvvlx: And we were evacuated???
[0:47:43] lewhitehd69: the US sucks BASED
[0:47:43] ChiSkillz: There are many places that "suck"  that isn't one of them
[0:47:45] lawfulevil_13: I'm not looking forward to the upcoming election. Everything gets so ugly during elections in US
[0:47:45] ItsAMoll: @ChiSkillz there are a lot of good things about america, but there are WAY more negatives than other places in the world
[0:47:49] ajak636: do you prefer playing in the red side or blue side?
[0:47:49] jvvlx: States are crazyyyy
[0:47:50] Undead_Vikings_Daxcraft: Also both Canada and Denmark got the colors of the flags the right way :D
[0:47:53] Niomah: @ChiSkillz People who think America doesn't suck right now are likely living in priviledge.
[0:47:56] call_me_teaa: @ChiSkillz If i speak, im in big trouble
[0:47:57] Angelyc: @ChiSkillz xdd
[0:48:00] Scooby_Dooby_Dew: America is mostly safe. just not in the major cities
[0:48:01] padampadamm: hey KP hey allll

[0:48:06] call_me_teaa: @Niomah ^^^^^^
[0:48:26] Angelyc: let me open reddit and look at the news.. says enough for me
[0:48:27] lawfulevil_13: Preach!
[0:48:29] ChiSkillz: As a jungler I prefer starting on Red side.  Its way too easy to sit in top side river bush and take blue side buff to start the game
[0:48:34] padampadamm: the American dream died when americans saw Europeans sharing their lives on social media lol
[0:48:34] priam0: KPrinha FTW
[0:48:39] jimbob_ywert: I feel like America is safer than many of the major countries out there, safety isn’t always criminal-based. poverty and environment matters too.
[0:48:41] Darkcyter: That's why it's called dream, reality is opposite
[0:49:08] Niomah: There have been 48 mass shootings in the US this year. It's only mid-February
[0:49:10] THE_Bacon90: sad but true
[0:49:11] ChiSkillz: a dream is just a dream.  Life is what you make of it
[0:49:12] lawfulevil_13: America is like LoL irl
[0:49:15] call_me_teaa: When I was young I thought America was SUPER cool, the heaven for geek stuff, now I wouldn't even consider moving there xdd
[0:49:18] Angelyc: @Niomah PREACH
[0:49:31] yanjii: @jimbob_ywert doesnt America have one of the highest poverty rates? talking about highly developped countries
[0:49:32] THE_Bacon90: i'm over living here
[0:49:39] iamtonin: why did that xerath stay for so long lol
[0:49:41] AutumnReds: america is many different states and life in each of them differs.
[0:49:42] evakp: yes so many shootings 🥺😭😭
[0:49:47] lewhitehd69: usa lowkey 3'rd world country xd
[0:49:57] ChiSkillz: east coast US taxi drivers. Never met a kinda one that didn't want to fight LuL
[0:50:00] THE_Bacon90: nice!

[0:50:05] Undead_Vikings_Daxcraft: Well played!
[0:50:06] msshinxx: nice oriii
[0:50:06] HunterrPlayyz: CLEAN
[0:50:07] theenation97: I think the tension is generally higher in more populated places because there’s more people giving off more energy
[0:50:07] Alfablade123: huge
[0:50:08] lawfulevil_13: Lol
[0:50:09] Rikutochi: outplayed
[0:50:14] Darkcyter: @Goriyay @theenation97 kaypHello kaypHello
[0:50:16] repichko: Nice
[0:50:18] evakp: so many shootings 🥺😭😭
[0:50:19] Darkcyter: @lewhitehd69 kaypHYPERS
[0:50:32] priam0: The only states i'd visit from USA are Texas, Florida and Colorado
[0:50:32] lawfulevil_13: I think the US is too big. It needs to fracture I to three to five sub areas and it would do better
[0:50:33] Goriyay: @Darkcyter kaypHello kaypHello
[0:50:34] jimbob_ywert: America offers the most privileges
[0:50:36] ChiSkillz: I flew into boston last year and this taxi driver was a straight up jerk
[0:50:38] jvvlx: I like key west tho
[0:50:39] msshinxx: i wouldnt even know where to visit if i went to america, so many places
[0:50:42] sequelsarenotcanon: thats true of most places
[0:50:43] jvvlx: in America
[0:50:43] lewhitehd69: @Darkcyter ellao
[0:50:49] jvvlx: its almost like Cuba haha
[0:50:54] senurastv: !EU
[0:50:54] Nightbot: For those just joining, KP has applied for her Danish Visa and is currently in Denmark (hence the change in setup). EUW KayPea lives on :)
[0:50:54] Niomah: Small towns in the US are only nice and good if you're white, straight, and christian in most cases
[0:50:55] theenation97: I’m from a small town and the vibe is very different, more ignorance but also a peaceful atmosphere
[0:50:59] jimbob_ywert: every country has its good and bads
[0:51:01] roxmysoxx89: anywhere is better than my country tbh
[0:51:02] Femuline: the big cities in america are very isolated in the sense that they forget that the majority of america is not a big city lol
[0:51:03] Darkcyter: kaypFreya
[0:51:06] Rikutochi: baaaark
[0:51:10] Angelyc: the health care system is a huge red flag
[0:51:16] thematzeboom: !Whatsapp
[0:51:20] HunterrPlayyz: i live in america, you’re absolutely right about everything you’re saying
[0:51:25] Femuline: i lived in both LA and NY and you’re in a bubble in those cities for sure
[0:51:37] jeroenvijver: off to work i go again, goodluck with the games kp and have fun with the stream^^ <3 <3
[0:51:39] Angelyc: road rage in the US is death LOl
[0:51:48] lawfulevil_13: Yeah, I'm not hearing anything out of line or untrue. This is 200% life in the us
[0:51:55] theenation97: also ‘being the best’ is forced down the throats of Americans and everyone is trying to get ahead and do better, etc and it’s stressful
[0:51:59] Darkcyter: Well, if you're rich, you can be happy anywhere
[0:52:04] Femuline: omg yes, i live in houston right now and the fact that i have to be worried i might get shot at a grocery store is wild
[0:52:09] RadiantWisp: you can fix roadrage with more guns /s
[0:52:10] jzipfel20: The amount of school shoots too is very sad!
[0:52:11] JYZero: stop badmouthing AMURICA KKona
[0:52:13] Saffy1: the u.s so far has had 49 mass shootings within 45 days of the new year
[0:52:18] lawfulevil_13: @radiantwisp LUL LUL
[0:52:19] ChiSkillz: You all have a great day!  gl in games.  I have to run to work before I'm late af LuL
[0:52:21] priam0: We have lot of imported moors, worst politics... But best food, Epic landscapes, free sanity system..
[0:52:29] jimbob_ywert: Poverty in US is insane too.
[0:52:33] call_me_teaa: @Saffy1 "america doesn't have a gun problem"
[0:52:46] nekrojiji: the gun part is also a good thing, in my country only baddies have guns
[0:52:47] call_me_teaa: also america:
[0:52:49] shedfirekid1: currently in NC, wife is from Raleigh. small world!
[0:53:33] Sarcastic_Sara: I'm from SC kaypCheer
[0:53:41] ChiSkillz: Another example.  Can't have a superbowl parade yesterday without 20ish people getting show
[0:53:44] ChiSkillz: shot
[0:53:56] priam0: @shedfirekid1 is DDE YouTuber from NC or SC?
[0:53:57] Angelyc: yep
[0:54:07] evakp: yes the chiefs parade yesterday 🥺😭
[0:54:09] jimbob_ywert: America needs some fixing
[0:54:12] ChiSkillz: Messed up and over half were kids
[0:54:13] viktorxcx: from what I've heard most american people want nothing more than to get out of there
[0:54:15] msshinxx: i wanted to go to the US for the next world cup but then i think of guns
[0:54:18] THE_Bacon90: NODDERS  unfortunately it's like this Sadge
[0:54:20] lawfulevil_13: Yeah, none of us are okay over here. All is lost and the only hope is the sweet release of death
[0:54:20] shedfirekid1: DDE?
[0:54:22] notclarkyyy: how's everyone's valentines?
[0:54:28] sovitiaisavampire: yeah but guns make litlle pepe men feel strong and manly so USA cant ban them
[0:54:28] tempest2600: netherlands have had 3 mass shootings since 2011 so we are doing pretty good
[0:54:29] Femuline: i mean the amount of mass shootings in america is just embarrassing. idk how anyone can be proud of this country sometimes
[0:54:44] priam0: @shedfirekid1 is a YouTuber 😅
[0:54:47] ChiSkillz: Yeah espn was putting out alerts from childrens hospital thoughtout the day
[0:54:55] evakp: yes the mass shootings 🥺😭😭
[0:55:00] TomNova: hai everyone, hope you're all having a lovely day kaypFlower
[0:55:00] sequelsarenotcanon: its knife crime in uk mostly
[0:55:05] shedfirekid1: @priam0 ahhhh I don’t know em sorry haha
[0:55:14] Femuline: but sadly guns make a ton of money here so they’ll never fix it
[0:55:14] roxmysoxx89: gun control isn’t the problem. people want to believe so, but my in my country guns are illegal and most of our crime, over 50% are from the use of guns
[0:55:21] TomNova: @sequelsarenotcanon yeah i saw alot of that on the news recently :(
[0:55:23] priam0: @shedfirekid1 its ok dude
[0:55:23] theenation97: it’s tough though because making comparisons and saying who is better and worse like idk, we’re all still living on the same planet no matter where we live
[0:55:24] iamtonin: not to undermine all shootings, but school shootings break my heart. those are kids and i feel awful for how the parents feel afterward
[0:55:29] HunterrPlayyz: i live here haha this shit is so depressing
[0:55:29] msshinxx: @roxmysoxx89 where are you from
[0:55:36] roxmysoxx89: Trinidad
[0:55:40] Niomah: The two party system, the upholding of capitalism, and the electoral college are ironically messing up democracy here in the US. It's a dumpster fire
[0:55:48] tempest2600: we need to bring back swords and shields thats way cooler then guns
[0:55:58] priam0: @roxmysoxx89 buen sitio
[0:56:08] roxmysoxx89: number 7 in the criminal index
[0:56:12] sovitiaisavampire: as mexican i cant feel any sympathy for americans, they love their gusn so much they poured mexico full of them too and now we have far more deaths to american guns than they do so 0 sympathy
[0:56:12] jvvlx: @roxmysoxx89 Think about it this way - if they were legal, there will be more shooting crimes
[0:56:14] lewhitehd69: bro need to check his mouse
[0:56:16] cuetreepie: lmaooo those dodges
[0:56:18] lawfulevil_13: Hugs to all in the US. DM me if you ever need to talk about shit and just have someone to talk too
[0:56:24] CipherAdminShady: its the Ori rust
[0:56:27] yanjii: I feel like America is full of paradoxes, when I was younger, in school I feel like most of ppl had such a perfect view of this country, it was some sort of a dream to move there and be like them, but the older I am the more scared I am when I hear and see all the news and stuff
[0:56:28] Femuline: we just need league irl and fight on the rift when we have disagreements hehe
[0:56:49] currykween: hey Kay, I’m in Australia and out gun laws are quite strict here, I’m a teacher and it hurts my heart every time I hear about the school shooting that happen in America
[0:56:49] THE_Bacon90: @lawfulevil_13 talk about a kind heart =] <3
[0:57:01] currykween: our*
[0:57:04] lewhitehd69: @KayPea how did we get into this topic btw? kaypCreep
[0:57:06] roxmysoxx89: @jvvlx well not exactly. all the citizens are calling for legalizing firearms. you wouldn’t know the solution until it’s implemented
[0:57:10] via_trita: America's ego got to itself
[0:57:11] priam0: Any spanish ppl here? (Just me I guess)
[0:57:13] Scooby_Dooby_Dew: America just has too many billionaires
[0:57:14] currykween: also hi! I hope your doing well lovely ☺️
[0:57:19] shedfirekid1: America used to be the “best” country in the world, and then they stopped caring or even trying
[0:57:22] roxmysoxx89: it could get worse it could get better
[0:57:32] yanjii: Also like ofc, US has a lot of good stuff that us, European people have to for example import, talking about goods, but when I see the life quality of people its often so bad?? The poverty is so high, the danger of everyday living its impossible for me to comprehend
[0:57:34] Femuline: how do you combat a xerath? any tips? he Qs me from narnia
[0:57:36] lewhitehd69: plink ok
[0:57:39] sequelsarenotcanon: america is too focused on military and foreign affairs they forgot their own
[0:57:39] jvvlx: How it would get better?
[0:57:58] yanjii: @sequelsarenotcanon thats so true
[0:58:00] steelkore: kaypRonin kaypRonin kaypRonin
[0:58:04] Niomah: @Femuline If you play a bruiser or tank uh, buy like 1 MR item these days :D
[0:58:07] jimbob_ywert: There’s a lot of factors that go against banning guns tho as well
[0:58:11] UrameshiFreecss: Hi Kay
[0:58:17] roxmysoxx89: there’s documentaries on Netflix about serial killings in USA and here, finding a headless body is a Tuesday
[0:58:20] yanjii: @jimbob_ywert for example?
[0:58:23] currykween: my one biggest fear is seeing my kids go through that
[0:58:24] Femuline: @niomah i also just play mages mid :(
[0:58:25] msshinxx: son of a beach kaypLunaRage
[0:58:27] priam0: Pretty unlucky
[0:58:28] Niomah: @Femuline Other than that he is highly immobile and can be punished for that
[0:58:36] RadiantWisp: reverse uno carded you
[0:58:52] Gromzzz: if you ban guns the mass murders will just come up with a diffrent tool to use
[0:58:58] belallaj: what happened, another school shooting?
[0:58:58] sovitiaisavampire: if i lived in the US i would move out Keepo

[0:59:13] HunterrPlayyz: i agree. living in this country is just a constant reminder that so much is wrong with it
[0:59:15] kenlaan: @Gromzzz lol
[0:59:16] Gromzzz: case where a guy with a box truck and crate of grenades  drove into a crowd
[0:59:17] tempest2600: ban regular ammo and make non lethal ones
[0:59:18] Femuline: no we require heavy topics!! tell us your political views now!!
[0:59:21] Femuline: jk 🤣🤣
[0:59:22] Gromzzz: more died from the box truck than the grenades

[1:01:05] careesha15: if there are words my brain will not compute the game

[1:03:07] markella_andri: I win in chest 3 skin for ori back to back
[1:03:14] PontiffYves: I really want them to make some skins similar to star guardian Orianna, in terms of not necessarily having a skin be 1850 to have such a drastic change in her walk.

[1:26:55] jvvlx: Diana goes jungle
[1:26:56] PontiffYves: @Jazzoholic Divine pheonix surely holds that spot
[1:27:07] Eldas_Algoris: haha
[1:27:21] PontiffYves: is that a riven mid
[1:27:29] shieldrules: hey I’m also Anivia main
[1:28:06] THE_Bacon90: kaypFlower
[1:28:12] tmiklea: DinoDance
[1:28:16] THE_Bacon90: i love the festival skin for anivia
[1:28:23] viktorxcx: didnt you used to play a lot of lissandra too ?
[1:28:30] Darkcyter: been ages since I've heard this song kaypVibe
[1:28:33] Darkcyter: love it
[1:28:37] Darkcyter: kaypVibe
[1:29:00] PontiffYves: What is that Riven skin, such radiant colours.
[1:29:09] Venom_Rush: @KayPea Are you living in EU? Your latency is so low o.O
[1:29:21] mrshibasan: Been a while since I played ANivia I lose my touch I used to be hood at my glacial augment anivia in team I love the slow with augment
[1:29:27] tmiklea: Just got 20 rep feedbacks o.o
[1:29:35] Niomah: ok taking a half sick day to lie down in the dark
[1:29:52] shieldrules: I would just use your q as defense if she gets to jump on you
[1:30:32] pianostics: I quit league as it's clearly quite addictive, BUT not a healthy addiction. I'm a professional pianist with many aspirations and a career to grow -- but it's so easy for League and instant gratification (or tilt) to take away from what's really important....
[1:30:46] Darke_Angle: How is it going chat  hey @KayPea kaypHello kaypHello
[1:30:56] lawfulevil_13: Good Fiona is terrifying
[1:30:59] MDelighted: what's the song :D
[1:31:03] Darke_Angle: hi @Darkcyter kaypHello kaypHello
[1:31:07] quark978: hi Kaypea!
[1:31:10] Venom_Rush: I once had a troll support in one of my ranked games who took anivia and walling off our adc from escaping the enemy laners. Did it to almost every one of us in the team
[1:31:10] viktorxcx: @lawfulevil_13 Shrek is worse LUL
[1:31:15] Darke_Angle: glad to hear ^^
[1:31:35] stable_octopus: What is your fav champ outside of your comfortable picks? aka: a champ you like and would like to be better at
[1:31:37] ItsAMoll: mid riven?!
[1:31:40] quark978: have we breaking out of losing streaks today?
[1:31:47] Fernandacm: d'jango playlist ?
[1:31:55] WWClown: is riven mid cheessy?
[1:32:01] jimbob_ywert: I can lower my addiction by creating a schedule. like 4 days a week, 3 games a day. helps create healthy balance
[1:32:03] pianostics: I'm based in Finland (but from US) but if I get a concert in DK, I will send you and Santorin tickets <3
[1:32:10] J_to_the_jf: a lot of people think they can do nothing and get a free win
[1:32:14] its_clamor: i try to have the mindset of what i can learn, how to improve, and new techniques to use in future games
[1:32:18] quark978: imo, One tricking is the single most boring thing that makes playing ranked suck
[1:32:21] sovitiaisavampire: what lol riven mid is a classic
[1:32:28] ballzagna1: vex ruins riven mid
[1:33:12] jimbob_ywert: @quark978 that’s subjective. I enjoy one tricking because Zoe is my favorite champ and I never get bored of her in ranked. and one tricking does make it a lot easier to master your champ and become comfortable, so you can have fun while focusing on macro
[1:33:20] hika_rike: Love your mindset! Do you ever get really tilted?
[1:34:11] quark978: @jimbob_ywert oh i don't disagree it can still be fun for the person who's one tricking, I just don't enjoy playing against ppl who have spent 300 hours playing a champ
[1:34:19] J_to_the_jf: some people are really good and coasting in ranked games (not you kay) Kappa
[1:34:59] jimbob_ywert: Tbh losing isn’t what tilts me. it’s the players, when your team is toxic or the enemy team bms. I think that’s why muting is the best option
[1:35:02] via_trita: poking
[1:35:07] mrshibasan: League is just my second game for entertainment if I'm bored with my first game I play league
[1:35:14] J_to_the_jf: No I just meant the mentality of "I'll just get them to carry me"
[1:35:29] jimbob_ywert: @quark978 LMAO I agree with that seeing a 800k Katarina is not fun
[1:35:33] ItsAMoll: how come naafiri doesnt seem popular in high elo?
[1:35:43] Mayveda: Conclusion: u can always get better at something
[1:36:20] FiveFM: kaypUpsetti <- KayPea not really tilting …
[1:36:34] belallaj: people who try new champ in ranked are different breed
[1:37:00] quark978: karthus got yo back
[1:37:05] WWClown: what you think about smolder?
[1:37:15] LouisZLoizos95: AND she gets the wave and canon LUL

[1:38:24] Ktyli: Yes anivia game🦅
[1:38:52] hika_rike: You're the faker in our hearts:))
[1:39:02] WWClown: but if you play for fun why are yall so mad for lpp gaining and losing
[1:39:16] via_trita: and thats why your mental is better than most
[1:39:20] mark__yeahhh: i watched a vid from 5 years ago and it looked like you had a waay better time with the game. Did you loose the fun aspect?
[1:39:32] InTsumiac: haii kelssss
[1:39:38] S17Master: @WWClown Because it's not fun to turbo dumpstered by people clearly above your skill level?
[1:39:38] Vegi700: everyone can reach master if put energy into improoving
[1:39:40] jimbob_ywert: @gcarna almost every player says that though, compare your plays to challenger Vods and I’m sure it’d be hard to back that statement up (not flaming just being realistic)
[1:39:52] InTsumiac: how are youu
[1:40:07] MrsBeebles: Hi hi! I hope you have a good stream and also good streams this weekend, I will be traveling for my baby shower this weekend <3
[1:40:10] via_trita: fiora is getting tilted
[1:40:44] ItsAMoll: illaoi is broken in half
[1:40:48] tempest2600: 5 years ago was 2019 i think u mean 9-10 years ago
[1:40:48] yanjii: im really frustrated about league recently, my 3 games are 14/6, 12/5, 14/6,  and all of them are lost, so frustrating
[1:41:14] FrostySupreem: GOOD MORNING KELS!

[1:42:39] evakp: @mrsbeebles awe congratulations just had my sisters baby shower last weekend 🥰 she’s due with my first nephew 🥺🥹
[1:42:51] via_trita: shutdown for egg, equal trade imo
[1:43:20] FiveFM: How gross is it that you dodged basically everything and she still woulda won!?
[1:43:24] sequelsarenotcanon: im just playing for fun
[1:43:26] jimbob_ywert: Valid goals 😭 I think a good goal is “to improve as much as I can” because then where you get is fulfilling your goal either way
[1:43:31] Vegi700: i need ranked goals to keep improoving
[1:43:45] mthebeaster: Hii everyonee
[1:43:47] TomNova: this is why i take breaks, to keep the mental in check
[1:43:57] MrsBeebles: @evakp Awe congrats! I'm also having a boy <3 <3
[1:43:59] quark978: this illaoi feels like the type to give up farm and towers and go for kills tbh
[1:44:05] dalig_: hey eveyone @KayPea daligCRflower
[1:44:05] TomNova: ill play a few then play something like aram to turn my brain off
[1:44:13] tempest2600: my goal is to not get chat restricted
[1:44:21] dalig_: Hey Kels  @KayPea daligAhri
[1:44:21] Vegi700: XD
[1:44:23] jimbob_ywert: I keep watching your old videos and get insanely surprised seeing you play champs like Teemo, Zed, and Yasuo lmao
[1:45:09] evakp: WP!
[1:45:10] J_to_the_jf: @quark978 that's 90% of league. games like COD and halo have made us wanna focus on the KDA over everything else.
[1:45:17] jimbob_ywert: Wp?
[1:45:20] jimbob_ywert: wp*!
[1:45:22] steelxdawn: Anivia is definitely your best champ
[1:45:24] FiraaTurk: gosh bless you’re crazy
[1:45:38] via_trita: best is relative to the comp
[1:45:47] jimbob_ywert: I think anivia is def your best champ
[1:45:54] JustCaptainMimmy: Hello Kels how is your day so far kaypInLove kaypHello kaypLove kaypH5
[1:46:03] jimbob_ywert: you play her well seem comfortable with her
[1:46:07] Sunnytinker: i like how they were struggling wit illaoi and got her fed, and then you just kind of show up and be like heeyyyyy and just kills her lol
[1:46:12] quark978: lmao the bard trolled her
[1:46:22] TomNova: LUL
[1:46:28] LouisZLoizos95: you can defo carry this uf ur team doesnt mental boom
[1:46:59] steelxdawn: anivia and ahri are definitely better than lux this season.
[1:47:25] quark978: wow that illaoi is 100% running it down for kills
[1:47:29] ozysx03: heyy how u doin
[1:47:29] jimbob_ywert: Have you heard of the change they’re making to the camera angles because there’s been complaints about the advantages the team that plays on the bottom side of the map has over the other side
[1:47:39] Sunnytinker: yeah
[1:47:51] JustCaptainMimmy: next patch Ahri will get another buff on her Q dmg
[1:48:25] steelxdawn: YOU MIGHT NEED LIANDRY
[1:48:29] SALEMX27: can you go 14/0 anivia again? you were ultra fed that one match lol
[1:48:31] Vegi700: @jimbob_ywert sound like copium
[1:48:41] torge_154: hi @kaypea kaypLove
[1:48:54] THE_Bacon90: would you ever do malignance with anivia?
[1:48:59] jimbob_ywert: @vegi700 maybe, but I’ve always felt that playing on the bottom side was much better. so much easier landing my abilities.
[1:49:01] THE_Bacon90: or would it be pointless?
[1:49:13] mentalfordaayz: Hi-a Kels how're the gaems?!? Not that you need it but good luck kaypLUL kaypLUL
[1:49:18] CipherAdminShady: rofl

[1:49:34] ThePeePuddle: What does he know? Kappa
[1:49:34] Vegi700: @jimbob_ywert its like that all on map , river is below high ground so abilities hit diffrent etc
[1:49:36] jimbob_ywert: WE WILL ALWAYS FLAME YOU FOR MALIGNANCE ON ANIVIA! kaypAnnoyed kaypAnnoyed
[1:49:48] S17Master: "It's bad." "But why?" "It's just shit." Thanks for helpful explanation

[1:51:02] jimbob_ywert: @s17master it’s mostly affected in laning phase. there has been some evidence showing that players on the top side have less screen space due to the ability HUD scale.
[1:51:02] THE_Bacon90: fair on better items

[3:04:58] SpyplaneSniper: @bluesiies whales are people that pay 10s of thousands of dollars into mobile games so they can have 'everything' and htey make up the bulk of mobile game company's profits. If they pay a streamer 5k to promote a game, they could catch 1 or 2 whales that will pay that back 5x overtime
[3:05:01] DemionDemon: so as a long time Raid player, i can confirm they get insane influx of money from their players.
