[3:05:45] Nightbot: don't ping me baccaMadge
[3:05:49] LeastToxicEgirl: and i love u
[3:05:50] Pernesti: @SpitZ_L0L if the splash is treated as a projectile it should get blocked. If it's a ground effect it would not. Judging from how the amount of splashes increases with his stacks it's probably a projectile and likely gets blocked by Xin ult.
[3:05:50] fulldanger47: If you are last pick and you see your gp is countered will you still go gp??
[3:05:50] LeastToxicEgirl: ok
