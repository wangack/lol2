[1:39:02] OceanBuffalo: yeah qiyana R works in river and bush too
[1:39:05] jokerius: @OceanBuffalo yea i know that but if you build tiamat i dont see the point
[1:39:07] OceanBuffalo: pretty much impossible not to stun
[1:39:38] OceanBuffalo: @jokerius because it's not 1 or the other. if 1 makes your clear faster, then both is even better
[1:40:05] jokerius: but you lose a lot of dmg on your shiv
[1:40:07] Ozoaken: @Seanroni looks like qiyana used w for water q which is a root, e through him r the wall q behind to root him
[1:40:52] OceanBuffalo: if you cast q while you're dashing through somebody it auto casts q in the direction of whoever you dash on
[1:40:55] Skyz_Ninjaz: @ChaseShaco Qiyana R stuns everything it touches in water

[1:42:56] Seanroni: i play this game a lot and i have never seen that type of root lol

[1:45:57] Skyz_Ninjaz: Ive gotten really good at cancelling Morde R with Viego R and it is the most satisfying thing ever

[1:46:52] OceanBuffalo: @Skyz_Ninjaz i practiced the viego R+flash smite trick a lot
[1:46:54] ultradevil07: I'd say that him R'ing the clone should make it on CD but not if you dodge it with R which is kinda easy if you're an intermediate shaco player
