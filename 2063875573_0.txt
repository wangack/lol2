[0:54:06] brandoniannn: 20min
[0:54:10] drokon: 20 min
[0:54:11] SimonBolivar2: its based on when you pee your pants a little
[0:54:11] brandoniannn: I thought???
[0:54:15] eatsey: there are 2 different versions of buff sharing rn
[0:54:18] drokon: it is after 20 min game
[0:54:20] brandoniannn: yea it’s 20min chat trolling
[0:54:29] arkfenza: big void crawler = double share buff.  baron  = team share
[0:54:33] amspace: when baroon spawns the blue/red become purple
[0:54:34] deathslng3r: serously ninja tabi buyyy pob
[0:54:38] TalesNT: Double buff is on elemental rift, that's on second dragon death. Full team buff is on baron spawn.
[0:54:41] Cheinas: 20 minutes is for everyone, when Rift Herald spawns for the pip
[0:54:42] mstep4266: 1 buff share starts after  2nd drake (when the elemental rift kicks in) team wide buff starts at 20 minutes @pobelter

[0:55:36] feedercarry4: everyone's wrong, the buff sharing starts at 14 mins if there haven't been two drakes taken yet. if there have, then it starts at 15 minutes or when baron nashor spawns but only if the 3rd drake is taken by the taken baron nashor spawns.
[0:55:44] cager1233: chat how much lp is rank 1
[0:55:49] cybeqLeo: 20mins = baron spawn = shared buffs
[0:55:49] feedercarry4: by the time*
[0:55:51] cybeqLeo: The monster becomes corrupted by the Void after Baron Nashor Baron Nashor spawns at 20 minutes into the game, turning into a Voidborn that empowers the Crest of Cinders to be granted to both the killer and all their allied champions if they are alive

[0:56:42] cager1233: when is pob gonna queue urf
[0:56:43] Togawaken: ty ty
[0:56:48] GioDudePlays: Ggs in the chat
[0:56:51] feedercarry4: but if the 4th drake is taken 5 mins after baron nashor spawns, then the buff sharing goes away for 2 minutes or until the next baron whichever comes first.

[1:14:02] HaloisJr: check vod
[1:14:03] brandoniannn: that’s why you let them get rhe killing blow on drake and stuff

[1:14:05] mrneverstopp: he fullcleared a lot maybe?
[1:14:08] LoLColby: after 2nd dragon is the answer
[1:14:12] Eriadar: its after 2nd drake is dead
[1:14:12] Redfactor3: its with elemental rift for the shareable one, and baron for team wide
[1:14:13] LoLColby: when the map changes
[1:14:23] LoLColby: when baron spawns its to everyone
[1:14:28] BoyderamBlockchiIIt: They changed it. Now its 2nd drake and nash spawn for whole team

[1:14:34] Kithlan: Just ask ChatGPT 4Head

[1:15:33] d1a_lol: this emote reminds me of bjergsen
[1:15:37] feedercarry4: No, all the wikis are outdated currently. Buff sharing starts when the 2nd drake is taken but it does not start if this happens after 20 minutes. After 20 mins, its dependent on baron spawn and the proximity to baron when it is taken. The buffs on the opposite side of the map are still shared, while the baron side buffs are not

[5:41:05] Pon_Solo: @TrueNorthGG  hahaha
[5:41:06] Dreww_P: im lactating rn
[5:41:06] Bear_IRL: Can a person who is male produce breast milk? The short answer is, yes, anyone can lactate. All children and teenagers have a small amount of breast tissue. If that tissue is exposed to hormones like estrogen and progesterone during puberty, it develops into a breast capable of making milk. But milk is normally only made in late pregnancy and while nursing.
[5:41:06] the_tozo: maybe hes just cracked chat
[5:41:07] LKrambeck: holy xerath

[5:42:32] TrueNorthGG: the discussion at the clinic i worked at was if men would be able to develop the nipples for a baby to actually latch onto and feed, that would be the hard part apparently because getting men to lactate is actually not that difficult lol
[5:42:33] Schmore2: csing script off for xer tho
[5:42:36] korenir: Waltuh. Stop missing creeps waltuh
[5:42:44] Pon_Solo: my wife works with a general surgeon who has been a doctor and surgeon for 35 years he will tell you that men do not lactate
[5:42:50] paaaanda1: @TrueNorthGG dont have to latch, just pump

[5:58:40] vince____________: why does chat think a challenger xerath scripts
[5:58:46] ScYx17: because chat is stupid
[5:58:48] zerodatman420: if you are in a long range matchups TF games look so boring

[5:59:22] LKrambeck: BIG
[5:59:22] Alveneb: canwin
[5:59:27] RivenTheVillain: @vince____________ because usually xerath is a scripters champ of choise
[5:59:30] RivenTheVillain: choice
[5:59:30] frighttrider: whys viego perma flashing in
[5:59:50] havoctft: @cjcunn506 It would be possible to hit chall while scripting just being a master level player though
[5:59:51] vgsquidward: imagine playing twister fate
[5:59:52] scamstars1: HmmmDeath
[5:59:56] imfishhdude: @cjcunn506 Definitely, just like 65% of the top 1000 in CS2 aren't wallhacking/aimbotting.
[5:59:58] vgsquidward: the dumbest champion
[6:00:12] scamstars1: HUH
[6:00:14] vince____________: twister fate bawkKek

[6:00:35] LiIgryph: buy amp tome  sell amp tome
[6:00:42] imfishhdude: But seriously, that is actually true. About 65% of them are wallhacking. KEKW
[6:00:58] havoctft: if anyone was going to script it would be now though before league adds vanguard
[6:01:02] LKrambeck: man void grub was such a nice addition to the game
[6:01:05] the_tozo: classic
[6:01:09] scamstars1: if only milo didnt steal half of the t2 gold
[6:01:14] YKJosh: how do you feel ab aatrox or mord top in low elo? bronze silver
[6:01:18] woogabooshi: @imfishhdude 65% of pros are walling?
[6:01:23] charmquark2000: @pobelter after game check your win rate blue side vs red side. you are welcome
[6:01:24] the_tozo: this script debate has really taken on a new form over the course of the game
[6:01:31] imfishhdude: @havoctft Vanguard doesn't really help. People actively cheat in Valorant.
[6:01:44] imfishhdude: @woogabooshi Not pros. Top 1000 in premiere.
[6:01:44] Reotoro: Shurelya??
[6:01:48] havoctft: oh i gueess they will just find a way around it
[6:01:55] woogabooshi: @imfishhdude ah i missed the context mb
[6:02:09] scamstars1: BIG
[6:02:12] the_tozo: @havoctft COPIUM i got destroyed by a jett shes cheating
[6:02:16] imfishhdude: That isn't to say that people don't cheat in the pro leagues.
[6:02:39] imfishhdude: Truthfully, I think it's a generational thing but... I digress.
[6:02:39] vince____________: I feel like cheating in challenger is a lot more difficult that a lower elo
[6:02:42] jayyrodx: pantsaresmurfing
[6:02:43] havoctft: im ngl i dont think any pro players are cheating
[6:02:48] vince____________: than

[6:02:58] Gonq: sadge
[6:03:07] bussinboots: his combo is auto smite XD
[6:03:12] imfishhdude: 90% of the COD Warzone pros were cheating, thats why they shut down the pro scene.
[6:03:18] LKrambeck: nice dodges tho
[6:03:37] kikibro: did you see that guys he toggled the script for the last ult charge Pog
[6:03:40] cjcunn506: who knows maybe cheating is more prevalent than I think
[6:03:43] ApocalypticFart: @imfishhdude You're comparing shitzone with an esport buddy
[6:03:49] Gendral: Fiora pepeGa

[6:04:20] havoctft: its the hacks man
[6:04:21] imfishhdude: @ApocalypticFart I'm not comparing anything, I'm stating that 90% of the COD warzone pros were caught actively cheating - which in turn killed the pro scene for the game entirely.
[6:04:27] simplypk: was actuallly a top deck yellow unlucky

[7:22:52] jordanmon18: @truly_ancient_truly_evil blem was good
