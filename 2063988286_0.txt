[1:14:06] ronchohonchoncho: Kayn very fitting for you old man Kappa
[1:14:35] MrDayga: LUL
[1:15:09] theGESofIT: I think the climbing is easier in master+ cause the skill variance is smaller, less complete shitters, easier to pick up the “worst” player on the team

[1:45:41] navcite: fire and ice
[1:45:46] johnsmith37: its smolderin time
[1:45:49] navcite: what is best in life?
[1:45:55] Indervoir: also i think you should swap to blue trinket as Noc right?
[1:47:53] TheLoho: Is Black Cleaver a bis 3rd item on Noc? Or is it just strong this game due to Yorick+need to survive rengar burst?
[1:48:08] navcite: To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women
[1:49:05] wilsonao: I saw that 11 up on baron

[1:53:26] wilsonao: Adc is shit
[1:53:49] LucasRulzZ: I believe he doesnt care
[1:53:51] wilsonao: The job of adc is to DPS objectives late game and not give kills
[1:53:57] LucasRulzZ: Same as tft
[1:55:04] mine360: mine360 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 86 months! ayo
[1:56:59] DigitalSeas: I enjoy watching you play supp and jungle
[1:57:01] wilsonao: Support is the funniest role to watch right now
[1:57:03] TheLoho: Aphromoo is a pretty nice support player to watch but
[1:57:05] Sheshantol: you cant get penta as support
[1:57:06] wilsonao: Funnest
[1:57:06] Anders092: overall support is probably the least intresting role
[1:57:12] TheLoho: It's tough to watch a 3rd Janna game in a row ya know?
[1:57:29] wilsonao: Low elo people don't know how good support is though
[1:57:32] keatonelliscubing: Support is so easy though
[1:57:34] Indervoir: people enjoy watching streamers suffer, so please play adc
[1:57:36] Xelyz: Botlane is boring as a whole to me
[1:57:38] Indervoir: :3
[1:57:39] wilsonao: Cause all they do is sit bot until game done
[1:57:41] rottedss: i Think it depends how good you are tbh and how much impact
[1:57:43] Sheshantol: zoomers and tiktokers want 1x9 adc/mid lane pentakill highlights
[1:57:45] bearalroll1: it depends, for me you have lots of good commentary so it’s great, some others don’t speak enough and it’s hard to just watch, the commentary is key.
[1:57:49] TheLoho: Support is really nice to watch but it's really tough to climb with unless you're at like... Plat+
[1:57:50] Dragonslave49: only you can hear me, summoner
[1:58:03] wilsonao: Play yuumi Madge
[1:58:17] wilsonao: It is super easy to climb with in low elo
[1:58:26] Indervoir: yeah i think only bad supports cant climb
[1:58:36] Indervoir: one of the easiest role to climb
[1:58:46] wilsonao: You just pick leona or mao Kai and roam everywhere and force every lane to win
[1:58:53] Sheshantol: true
[1:58:55] Indervoir: since you decide who to play with
[1:59:29] Indervoir: ping the ward Despairge
[1:59:56] LucasRulzZ: Saint will never ping the ward
[2:01:09] Dragonslave49: I am new to league, how to ping wards?
[2:02:43] navcite: circke window when you use the key to ping
[2:03:15] navcite: kek
[2:03:17] hslxo: Despairge
[2:03:21] itsDoppel: LUL
[2:03:22] CheckYorSix: Ezreal thumbs up your death... he is trolling
[2:03:24] medisinskapet: Chatting
[2:03:58] wilsonao: Losers q game YEP
[2:04:17] wilsonao: This is like 90% a go next
[2:04:19] Wiznatts: i feel like half the people that pick ezreal do it cause they're scared of playing ad and just wanna press q on the wave
[2:04:47] ShiggieDiggy: theres other reasons to pick ezreal?
[2:05:11] CheckYorSix: cant stand ezreal personally. I think his kit is weak overall
[2:05:23] wilsonao: He strong
[2:05:33] Wiznatts: w-e is a lot of damage you just have to not be a pussy
[2:06:25] wilsonao: This is why I never pick supports that stay in lane lol
[2:06:49] hslxo: xdd
[2:06:51] wilsonao: If we were bard we would've ditched his ass to go on an adventure
[2:07:18] ShiggieDiggy: ez his most played champ rip
[2:07:34] wilsonao: Bought account then lol
[2:07:58] Wiznatts: sadge
[2:07:58] wilsonao: Roam for sanity
[2:08:04] ShiggieDiggy: time to roam TTours
[2:08:06] josephwalkinson: he doesn't play ezreal lol
[2:08:15] hslxo: xdd 󠀀
[2:08:27] AllTheBishops: 1 2 3 4
[2:08:48] geeko101: his looks like a scheduled loss
[2:08:55] wilsonao: Sanity roam EZ
[2:09:27] ChessBoxinLIVE: lol wth jhin mid
[2:09:37] wilsonao: Malphite with the "can win" lol
[2:09:50] hslxo: ff go next angle
[2:10:31] josephwalkinson: mal really good champ here tbh
[2:10:45] hslxo: xdd
[2:10:48] Indervoir: prolly boosted
[2:11:03] Wiznatts: so apparently udyr has had +20% tenacity on aram for over a year and that seems crazy as shit
[2:11:16] Indervoir: boosted for sure then lmao
[2:11:18] Wiznatts: is his wr _that_ depressed from people building bad damage items
[2:11:45] wilsonao: Lol no way this ez isn't a bought account
[2:13:28] Wiznatts: account has been playing ezreal/lucian since season 4 basically
[2:13:48] Indervoir: check the ez's previous seasons, prolly boosted before then stayed in this elo
[2:19:31] Wiznatts: darn the ezreal got money from the shutdown smiteKench
[2:19:59] josephwalkinson: jesus
[2:20:07] Wiznatts: no saint, call him gamer words so he knows how bad he is
[2:20:08] TheZeitHeist: some adcs will just mentally implode if you pick ashe support
[2:21:12] wilsonao: Ez didn't do a single w-q the entire lane
[2:21:17] TheZeitHeist: yea lots of ezreals forget to even auto lol
[2:21:57] wilsonao: He needs to get to silver elo basically
[2:22:15] Wiznatts: don't type if you're not high elo like me (silver II)
[2:23:18] Wiznatts: the boy shifted in when panth's cc was used on you smiteGems
[2:23:21] wilsonao: Eh they sidestepped that one
[2:24:52] simszszy: PogChamp
[2:27:48] viciousss24: Malph is awful wtf
[2:27:59] TheZeitHeist: top laners lol
[2:28:13] wilsonao: Yay! We are free!

[2:29:29] jaseff693: love ya saint long time curse fan! you are the goat
[2:30:39] slumzzz: im doing nothing, how am i losing !
[2:31:16] TheZeitHeist: saintv streams got me from silver to diamond in s3 so ill sit thru these commercials np
[2:32:42] TheZeitHeist: riot put me in challenger games at start of season, all i learned is why NA has a hard time at worlds, riot should start banning all these people
[2:34:07] wilsonao: Ez was bad that game but malphite was the one throwing it on repeat tbh
[2:34:51] wilsonao: WHY AR YOU BOT SYLAS I WANNA 5 MAN WITH NO ULTZ
[2:35:46] itsDoppel: @TheZeitHeist trickle down ELO
[2:36:03] Wiznatts: nah man its gonna be q max hail of blades trinity vayne to play agro with you
[2:36:06] Wiznatts: Kappa
[2:36:12] TheZeitHeist: @itsDoppel im just a masters peaker but it put me in challenger games for a while for going 3/2 in placements lol
[2:36:12] wilsonao: Watching Saint was how I got from plat to silver
[2:36:58] Aaylas: If you play Zac, we can call you St. Viscous
[2:38:32] forsake23: star guardian?
[2:39:56] wilsonao: Did he counter pick himself again tho?
[2:40:42] LucasRulzZ: Rell was redeemed, ironclad and cavalier
[2:43:05] wilsonao: The same way he dies using it EZ
[2:46:39] Klutch81: i didn't know killing wards grants xp
[2:46:47] wilsonao: Pog
[2:47:07] wilsonao: I know this dude who named himself after some cowboy bebop villain

[2:48:03] Drakkulis: idk, Yamcha taught us all what being cucked was
[2:48:05] xOkamiyasha: my name was def inspired by Inuyasha  lmao
[2:48:17] Wr8th: is mumu ever going to be a good jungle again?
[2:49:06] wilsonao: Krillin taught us about how to be a transhumanist if you are too big a loser to land a gf
[2:53:49] TheLoho: How come my bot lane GETS killed and then forgets dragon exists?
[2:54:54] Th3_Captain: ashe
[2:57:30] itsDoppel: Keep powering up Majin Vegeta
[3:01:15] fatguy925: is dyr any good?

[3:02:19] fatguy925: rooIsee
[3:02:23] Th3_Captain: majin plays him a bunch- and he has been in saints games as well
[3:03:18] fatguy925: rooIsee
[3:03:58] fatguy925: I love udyr early seasons but hated that it felt like you had to be gigachad early or late game you were just a big minion tank or forever kited
[3:06:16] fatguy925: Honestly wish they made an axolotol dragon champion that at high hp its a tank and sheds into a dps at low hp
[3:06:28] AzertyKeys: goddamn you're tanky
[3:06:57] east_ll: whoever balanced riven needs to be fired
[3:09:00] fatguy925: That vayne pathing felt wrong
[3:09:11] fatguy925: rooIsee
[3:09:25] wilsonao: How does riven die ever?
[3:10:16] fatguy925: I think Riven was like YI, where they are tanky due to their high burst that applies heals or shields, but if you cc burst them, they are fragile.
[3:10:21] Wiznatts: getting to objectives on time is actually illegal its a good thing your team avoided it
[3:10:52] wilsonao: It's true. It's all there in the 10th Amendment
